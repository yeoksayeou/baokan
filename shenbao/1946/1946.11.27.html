<h3>中共如召開所謂國大將引起嚴重後果分裂爲政府決難容忍</h3>
<p>〔合衆社特派員羅根南京廿六日電〕政府發言人今日聲稱：倘巾共決定召開所謂解故區人民大會，同時共軍繼續進攻綏南，楡林時、則國軍將對延安發動討伐攻勢。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕頃自關係方面獲悉，共軍針對目前召開之國民大會，亦決議於雙十前後在延安召開解放區國民大會，幷正式成立民主聯合政府，統編八路軍及東北民主聯軍等爲「民言國軍」，以與國民政府相對抗。同時，儘量搜括榨取解放區內人民之財產·資源·物資，用以換取法幣·金銀·關金，屯儲共區，進行破壞國家經濟，幷擴大排美反美之宣傳運動等，記者廿六日特以此項消息可能發生之後果爲題，走詢某軍事觀察家，據答稱：中共代表周恩來於返延安前，曾公開聲明延安尚無召開解放區人長代表大會之意，果如是，則協商之門尚未關閉，國軍決無進攻延安之必要，但如中共違背全民利益，擅自召開僞國民大會，另組割據政府，分裂國家，則人民決不容政府坐視中共之叛國行爲，屆時可能迫使政府軍進攻延安，以粉碎其祖國陰謀。另一原因，亦可迫便政府軍進攻延安者，即陝北共軍目前正繼續猛攻楡林是也。楡林爲綏南鎖鑰，該處國軍兵力單薄，如一旦被共軍攻陷，影響綏包安全，且晋陝邊境共軍已攻陷永和。大寧及其附近各據點，顯然向國軍挑衅，其可能引起之後果，實不堪設想也。</p>
<h3>長春被俘人員四十名已獲釋</h3>

<h3>共軍高郵縣長楊天華被俘獲</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿六日電〕共軍高郵縣長楊天華·昨在高郵白馬廟爲駐軍廿五師俘獲，當塲幷鹵獲機槍兩挺，步槍十餘支、共軍廿餘人，刻已解縣府法辦。</p>
<h3>馬特使今日離平昨與軍調部三代表晤談</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕馬歇爾特使行館稱：馬使廿七日離平。截至廿六日夜止，尚不明其將赴何處。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕確息！馬歇爾廿六日已與葉劍英會晤，談話內容不詳。廿六日晨美陸戰隊司令霍華德在東軍機塲閱兵，馬帥於九時一刻應請往觀禮，半句鐘後，返回主席行轅，九時五十分馬帥再度外出，赴軍調部與吉倫商談，十一時許葉劍英赴執行部，即參加會談，歷時一時有半始散。爲帥旋赴孫連仲歡宴，陳繼承，吉倫夫婦，蔡文治等作陪，席間杯觥交錯，賓主盡歡，二時十分席散，馬帥偕吉倫，蔡文治辭出赴軍調部，先在蔡文治參謀長室談話的十五分鐘，二時卅五分，馬氏登樓與吉倫單獨商談一小時零五分，至三時四十分，馬帥返回主席行轅休息。晚七時半，馬帥在行轅宴客，到有吉倫上將夫婦，空軍上校范九生及一連長，綜觀馬氏在平一日來，除應孫連仲宴外，未作任何應酬，亦未往遊西山，惟與吉倫接觸最密，並與軍調部政府，共產黨兩方負責人晤談，可知馬氏北來任務，必與駐華美軍及軍調部有關。馬帥今日除主動拜訪外，未接見任何賓客，即地方最高當局亦不例外·</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕葉劍英語記者，廿六日午前，曾以私人資格訪馬帥，對記者各項問題，則堅拒作答。下午四時，葉曾與吉倫晤談。</p>
<h3>國大二次會</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　濮德玠</p>
<p>—議事規則成爲爭執中心</p>
<p>二十六日國大第二次會議，中午散會後，一致的批評是太亂了，只聰見台上連說，「先表決維持原案」，台下大嚷「秩序問題」，七嘴八舌，顚三倒四，一片亂噪噪，毫無精采演出。一位代表感慨系之的說：「沒有人注意到民主，對它旣未尊重，亦未善用，好在是審查會。</p>
<p>大會纔開始，報告員剛宣讀了上次會議紀錄，一位代表就霍地站起來，「主席！究竟是開大會，還是開審查會？」洪秘書長慢慢的回答：「等等主席要說明的。</p>
<p>洪氏有條有理地報告過主席團前一晚對議事規則草案第四章之意見歸納結果後，小心翼翼地說：「請個歸納結果，秘書處奉命在按術方面作了點工作，作的很謹愼，不敢隨便，如有不正確的地方請大家提出」。會衆一致鼓掌稱讚。</p>
<p>開始表決時，樓上第一排的蘇職代表倪弼，大喊「秩序問題」，說是這是審查會，沒有說完的，應該再說，會中發生爭論和會終最後幾章順利無異議讀過時，他又數度大嚷：「秩序問題」，和樓下前半最後一排一直在呌着「維持原案」的冀區代表張之江成鮮明對比。</p>
<p>朱經農和陳長蘅兩人，一個在右一個在左，各拿着塲中的擴音器等待發言，一個機會來了，兩人一齊說，合唱一番，朱無可奈何的回到位置上去。</p>
<p>不知是運用，還是習慣，于主席主持表決總是先表決「維持原案」，最初就引起了反對，「應將反對意見光表決！」「先表決修正案！」「秩序問題」「嘶　嘶！」一時鳥烟瘴氣，秩序大亂，台下不服，台上失措，遴選代表蔣中正氣憤地站起來三次，高聲說：「請維特代表尊嚴，特別要邀守秩序，這種情形不是國大應該有的。」秩序才好一點，聽說他對昨天的秩序情况已生氣了。</p>
<p>于主席用陝西話說：『凡贊成維特原文的，捺各自的「電鈴」』，說着還作了個手勢。洪秘書長在某項表決時說：「會塲的空位子很多，請每個代表不要錯捺了沒有人的位子上的電鈕」。記者席上有人私語。</p>
<p>討論第二十六修時，某代表說：「動議不是提案，不必連署附議，就够了，應該修正。」洪秘書長問了問于言席向大會說：一表決好不好？　「好，」表決器電燈大亮，滿塲喝采。洪雖在台上看不到，聽到　擊也說：「大多數，大家都已看慣了。」</p>
<p>對臨時動議的附議人數，爭執頗烈，一個代表主張「五人以上」，另一個代表說：「五人以上太容易了，臨時動議太多妨碍大局。」洪秘書長接着說：「這一點本人本想說，但因爲地位關係不好提出，請大家注意會塲太大，人太多。」二十八歲的麥煥新在樓上說：「我們新疆代表全體反對須有過多的附議人數，因爲我們一共才有十八個代表」。洪秘書長連忙解釋說：「這個人數的規定，決無用以限制任何一部分，一單位代表的用意。」結果通過了「十人以上」的折衷意見。</p>
<p>關於臨時動議要不要書面形式一點，頗有爭議，一個代表說：「沒有書面沒有根據，怎麼可以？」一個代表說「成立議案就是根據，」那一個「呃！呃——」還沒說下去，樓上突出一個「我有一個最好的意見，」全塲靜聽之餘覺得不見得，表決後還是要書面。</p>
<p>第四章進行時，于右老面紅耳赤，兢兢業業，第四章過後，大感輕鬆，興冲冲地站起來大讀以下條文，讀一章，問一聲「有無異議？」回答是「無異議，」「無異議就通過了。」</p>
<p>蔣主席在上午開會時，坐於一號代表位上，休息後即退席離去，午後仍然出席，除於秩序頂混亂時發言提醒會衆外，沒說一句話·蔣夫人全日未出席。</p>
<p>下午討論審委會組織通則時，陳顧遠，戴修駿提出第七條，加一個第二項，要將各審委會的會議紀錄，印發全體代表參攷。史尚寬提出在第十條和第十一條間加一條，把審委會的表決方法和決議成立條件改訂，但都未蒙大會通過。三位法學家一齊吃</p>
<p>于主席宣讀某修正案時，一位代表突出講話，于老說：「等等，還沒說完啦。」進行討論時，一聽說有意見，于老馬上把眼鏡取下來望望說：「好好」，洪蘭友和雷震是他的左輔右弼，洪全神注意會塲，雷全力協助于策劃·</p>
<p>在會塲裏記者碰到桂永淸：「副總司令，你的招待會的願幾時還」，桂氏笑謂：「快了快了，我今天就找大家帮我開記者名單」。</p>
<p>下午大會全程風平浪靜，和午前的亂七八糟，成天淵之別。一個同業說：「物極必反」，大家寫寫意意很快的就結束了。</p>

<h3>盛世才被彈劾案　言新疆時違法犯紀罪惡昭彰抓牙三十六人亦送法院審理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕前新疆省主席盛世才違法犯紀，殘暴貪黜案，自監委嚴莊，主新令提出彈劾後，業經監委萬燦，鄧春膏等審查成立，移付懲戒，其爪牙卅六人之刑事部份，亦送交法院，分別逮捕審理。據聞彈劾案內容略爲：盛自民廿二年主政後，在新形同割據，種種違法犯紀，殘暴貪黷之事，擢髮難數，手下爪牙，最著者有卅六人，其中十人嗜殺成性，新人談虎色變，稱之爲十大劊子手，兇暴可見。盛等主要罪狀，有下列數者：（一）濫用奇異刑具，不下廿餘種，虐殺無辜，有可稽者達八萬人，其他秘密處死者更不知凡幾。（二）監獄遍於全疆，僅迪化一地，即有十二處，該地六道溝煤窰廢窟，即當年虐殺無辜之處。（三）几被囚禁者，家產悉被沒收，眷屬咸遭放逐，至阿山伊犂一帶，至今猶有難歸者。（四）盛離新時，監中尚三千餘人，盛擬將彼等置死，以營救得免。（五）盛主政十載，民間一切寸藏爲之搜括殆盡，盛臨行時，　寳物俱走，此爲迪化市民所目睹；至爪牙盜竊變賣，更難計數。新疆臨參會卅四年對盛種種罪行，曾提控告，其事蹟詳於疆地人民所編之「盛世才禍新紀略」，迪化地方法院亦曾有名單提出。</p>
<p>記者以此案關係重大，曾走訪提出彈劾之監委嚴莊，王新令等，因公他出，乃訪該案審查人監委萬燦，承談二監院掌理風憲，對邊疆大吏之功罪，自應根據國家利益，政府法令，與人民之呼聲，予以處理，同時爲維　國權與安定民心，對此案亦特別重視；余（萬自稱）審查一切後，認不得不予同意，故贊成此案之成立。萬氏並談其對盛氏種種禍國罪行之感想稱：新省二千餘年來，與中華民族已形成不可分離之一部份，關係極爲自然，唐代且曾協助其內部排難解紛，該地民族稱唐爲天可汗。盛氏夤緣時會，竊據該地，其政策根本錯誤，不惟昧視世界情勢。國家政策，且絲毫不顧當地人民利益。致中華民國整個利益受其影響，少數民族亦蒙其不利，爲國家及人民計，對此種罪行，實不能不予過問云云。</p>

<h3>中國經濟的更生之路</h3>
<p>自中美商的簽字之後，在中國的美國商人，就積極開始其商務活動，不但引起我國國內一部份人士的誤解，而且英國的議員也衣示萬分的焦急，要求議會派遣代表團到中國來實地調查我國政治的及經濟的情形。我們單從中美商的的條文看來，的確是很容易引起誤會的。若十中國報紙甚至露骨表示，稱此爲新的不平等條約；英國議員也率直地說：「美人現正向中國施行壓力，企岡將英國商人，摒棄於中國的門外」。由這巾美商的所引起的疑雲愁霧，不論在國內或國外，似乎日見濃厚了，實在有加以消除的必要。司徒大使前天在滬招待報界，關明中美商約的精神，一方面說明中國並不喪失其關稅自主權及管制航運與對外貿易的權限；另一方面則鄭重表示：「美國並不想要，也並未得到在華的特殊權利』。英國議員聞了這一番話，也可以勿爲「美國使中國將英國商人辦棄於中國門外」而担憂了。</p>
<p>中美商的的精神，完全建立在平等與互惠的原則上。誠然，美國是工業發展到最高階段的資本主義國家，中國是工業落後的農業國家，尤其是經過八年抗戰之後，滿目瘡痍，不論我們對於中美兩國貿易以平等互惠爲原則，說得天落亂墜，但是在實際上，中國旣無法與美國處於平等地位，亦不能享受美國給我們的「惠」。但是目下我國正在建國時期，不僅萬般皆落後，需要急起直追，迎頭幹上去；而且百廢待舉，在物質上的需要甚爲迫切，尤其需要友邦盟國在經濟上的援助與合作。而美國前在抗戰期間，曾在軍事上予吾人以莫大的援助，今在建國期間，美國仍舊極願在經濟上協助中國建設，以完成其建國的偉業。其動機完全爲了遠東的和平與繁榮，同時也爲了世界的和平與繁榮，絕不懷有任何自私自私的野心，企圖在中國取得特殊權利，以壟斷整個的中國市塲；所以中國毫不懷疑美國懷有任何野心，毅然決然與美國簽訂商的；但在內心，仍堅持着兩種條件，絕無讓步或妥協的餘地。</p>
<p>第一是主權的不容侵犯，中美商的雖以平等互惠爲原則互相予以最惠國待遇，但是我們對於關稅的自主權，對於航行的管制權以及對於進出口貿易的限制權，不論在何種塲合，都是不容他國侵略的。尤其是我國產業落後，需要採取適常的保護政策，最近行政院修正進出口貿易的辦法，包括下列三項：（一）一部份進口貨晚率的提高；（二）對於不必要的進口貨加以限制甚至加以禁止；（三）對於十分需要的進口貨如機器及交通工具等予以鼓勵及便利。美國對此也未表示異議，由此可以證明，外謂中美商約實爲新的不平等條約，完全是一種誤釋。</p>
<p>第二不願厚此薄彼，中國現行外交政策及其對外貿易政策，一言以蔽之，乃在與「以平等待我之民族」，通力合作，共同維持世界和平及促進人類繁榮及幸福，故對於任何友邦或盟國，均一視同仁，絕對不分軒輊，而加以歧視，中國固願以平等互惠爲原則，與美國締結商的，對於其他各國，亦願以此爲談判的基礎，與他國締結商的，英國商務訪問代表團來華，也曾獲得我國人民廣大的歡迎，就是一個好的證明。英國議員杞憂中國甘心爲美國壟斷市塲，而將排斥他國商人，實在沒有理由可言，這或許由於隔閡所致。俟至英國商務訪問代表團返國之後，即可明白中國的實際情形，因中美簽訂商的而引起的疑雲，也就可以煥然冰釋了。同時從美國的貿易政策看來，她是一貫的主張國際自由貿易的，反對任何國家　斷市塲，所謂「己所不欲勿施於人」，美國決無壟斷中國市塲的企圖，所以司徒大使前天也說：『美國並不想要也沒有得到在華的特殊權利。』</p>
<p>上述兩點，是中國與各國締結新商約的共同原則；惟中國與各國締結新商的，是中國在條約上取得平等的第一步，如能以此爲出發點，力爭上游，當不難與其他各國並駕齊驅，但若僅僅以文字上的平等，爲已足，則決不是眞正的平等，而可稱之爲「假平等」。我國在假平等的情形之下，不僅口惠而實不至，要感覺到失望，而且到處要吃虧，故不得不更進一步，謀得眞正平等的實現。目下中國經濟的實際情形，可從兩方面去觀察，一方面是出口貿易的陷於窒息狀態；另一方面是外國貨的充斥市塲，使整個的經濟機構，有總崩潰之處。關於造成前項情形的因素，不一而足，其中最重要的原因，一在匯率的不能平衡，中國幣値太高，致使中國的出口貨不能在國外獲得市塲，二在中國農業的落後，致使出口貨的品質，未能改善。而調整匯率，不是一個簡單的問題，而且一　足以牽動全局，自有待　密考慮。至於改進農業，更是ｇ　個極端複雜的問題，亦非一蹴可就．關於造成後項情形的因素，更是一言難盡，洋貨充斥市塲的結果，足使先天不足的民族工業，完全歸於毀滅。</p>
<p>但是如何挽救中國經濟的危機？治標的姑置不論，治本的唯有改進晨業生產一途。中美農業技術合作幽考察全國農業之後，曾發表一種建議，提出七項具體辦法：（一）推廣農業敎育，由農林部與敎育部切實合作；（二）辦理低利農貸，以供農產物運銷之改進，並改善佃租制度，以及實施政府頒佈之土地法；（三）設立一國家農業銀行，統籌全國農業金融；（四）設立農業管訓局，辦理動植物檢疫及農產品分級檢騐；（五）政府對於農業物資農田水利及獎勵使戀情化學肥料；（七）對於主庶外銷之農產品，應該勵共輸出·這七項辦法，切實而易行，我國政府確有加以研究的必要，金陵大學美籍敎授貝克，在華多年”深知我國農業實情，最近表示，也希望我國政府能够採行。</p>
<p>要之，我們對於中美商的的本身，實在無瑕可擊；但是我國以工業落後的農業國，如何始能與產業發展到頂點的資本主義國家，處於眞正平等的地位，得以享受其「惠」而不致吃虧，實在需要我們的「自力更生」。「國與國」之相處，猶如「人」與人之相處，實在沒有兩樣。「君子自强不息」，國家也要「自强不息「，尤其是萬般皆落後的中國，格外需要刻苦自勵，加倍努力，克服經濟的困難，而臻於產業發展之境，俾從「假平等」步人眞平等的階段·</p>

<h3>法本土參院選舉結果　人民共和黨佔優勢　共黨仍要求總理席但希望已益減少</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿五日電〕人民共和黨在星期日之選舉中，卒已佔得領導地位。內政部於今日下午更正今晨所宣布之選舉結果，準確之最後結果乃人民共和黨當選者二四，七五一名，共產黨及準共黨之共和抵抗聯盟當選者共二四，五四四名。此項更正，在心理上影響甚大，人民共和黨在上次普選時之挫折，或能於十二月八日參院選舉中補償之。星期日之選舉中，在二千五百萬選民中投票者僅一千八百萬名，棄權者約佔百分之二七·六；而在上次　選中，　種者僅佔百分之二一·六。人民共和黨之佔優勢，可增加彼對反對共黨出任總理之聲勢。共黨今仍未放棄此項要求，但其成功希望已益少。根據法國新憲法規定，參院對總理之任命無置　之權，繼理係由總統任命，而由衆院批准。但星期日之選舉結果，可減少共黨出任總理之籍口，同是在談判組織聯合政府時，人民共和黨亦可望因此取得共黨較大之讓步。</p>
<h3>與共黨合組內閣以前　人民黨將提三點協議</h3>
<p>許多人民共和黨領袖雖認拒絕共黨參加職合政府勢所不能，但彼等將堅持在允與共黨同時組閣以前，應由雙方就下列三點成立協議：（一）議定政綱，尤其關於財政改革之計劃。猶憶內閣於今年六月雖會議定工資物價之凍結政策，但共黨仍經由總工會發動要求較高工資之運動。（二）內閣各閣員應負眞正集體責任。人民共和黨猶未忘前此共黨閣員所通過之政策，曾被共黨報紙據以攻擊非共黨閣員。今日巴黎又有工會會員三萬五千人，在工黨人員領導下示威，抨擊政府之糧食政策。人民共和黨人士認爲此乃政府各黨未能充分負担集體責任之故。（三）各部不得由黨所把持，人民共和黨覺過去若干部之部長有久佔該部之意，故將任職頗久而富有經騐之人，免除其所佔之重要職位，代以同黨黨員，比等現象今後必須消滅。</p>
<h3>皮杜爾內閣明年初結束</h3>
<p>皮杜爾內閣於下星期四衆院舉行首次會議時，即將辭職政界人士預料：衆院將請現政府繼續供職，至明年一月選出共和國總統時爲止。參議之職權雖僅爲咨詢性質，但參院員有建議法律之權，更得將法案送回衆院複議；送回以後須經絕對大多數通過後始能採納，而共黨社會兩黨在衆院中即使聯合一致，亦未能達到絕對大多數之人數也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電」關於法國參議院「選舉人」選舉結果，經法國官方宣布之後，頃由內政部發表聲明，予以更正。略謂：人民共和運動黨在法國本部八十九省內（科西嘉除外）當選之選舉人，共爲二四·七五一名，並非二四·一五一名。至於共產然當選「選舉人」者，則仍爲二四·二七一名，故就　國本部而言，人民共和黨實較共黨略佔優勢。獨立共和黨當選「選舉人」者，共爲二·六九九人，並非三，二九九人。此外據此間接獲法屬阿爾熱里亞選舉結果：社會黨共產業聯合派佔優勢，共當選「選舉人」一·一三六名，約相當於總數五分之三。人民共和黨，激進社會黨，及右派集團居其次。常地觀察家認爲左派集團所以獲勝，係因其黨員之棄權者較穩健派及右派人士爲少之故。</p>
<h3>最後結果尚待揭曉</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿五日電〕共產黨與人民共和黨在參議院選舉人之選舉中，已形成賽跑之局勢。科西嘉島結果揭曉後，局勢又有改變，共黨在該地當選者二四四名，而人民共和黨當選者僅四名，其餘之急進黨獲二〇九名，獨立共和黨獲一〇六名，戴高樂聯盟獲五名。阿爾熱里亞之一部份開票結果，顯示人民共和黨。急進黨·自由共和黨·獨立黨共獲八〇四名，而共黨及社會黨則共獲九十二名，故須俟該地選舉總結果揭曉後，共產黨及人民共和黨之形勢始能確定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿五日電〕法國大選共黨獲勝，可能使延　多時之對德和的四强談判遭遇另一困難。巴黎業已傳出消息，謂法國新政府準備處理在　國日爲世界最大問題之　國將來問題當在明年一月間或一月以後。但四强外長會議已在今年秋初成立協議，擬不日在此開始初步討論。美國務卿貝爾納斯不致忘懷此項協義，因渠素來堅持非至列强對德問題獲有若干諒解時，世界和平之努力斷不能有何進步也。</p>
<h3>調查非自治領土　我國建議遭否決</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿五日電〕中國提議調查非自治領土一案，今日由聯大經濟政治委會否決。此一問題最初係菲律賓代表團長羅末啓提出，羅氏指責保有殖民地者祇知自私自利。中國代表團繼之提議授權託管委會對於尚未實行自治各地提出報告，今日以十票對九票被否決。美英法荷等國均投反對票。</p>
<h3>調查國外駐軍問題　三強意見仍分歧　美認裁軍問題尤爲重要</h3>
<p>〔本報紐約特派員廿六日專電〕聯大會政治安全委會討論各國軍隊問題，迄今已歷四日，對於三强意見之紛歧，顯未能使之趨於一致。本日美參議員康納利及英代表諾爾貝克向該委會提出英美兩國之意見，美國堅特原來立塲，要求聯合國會員國公佈國內及國外軍隊之數字。英國放棄各國軍隊問題應爲整個軍縮計劃一部份之原來主張，而贊同美國建議，要求採檢查制度，務使各會員國均能正確服告國內外軍隊數字。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿六日電〕今日權威人七聲稱：美國已準備力請聯合國機構對於限制世界軍備程序，包括國際管制原子能在內，立刻採取行動。美代表團亟欲暫時放棄各國報告軍力問題，而集中力量於裁軍事宜。因美代表團認爲裁軍事宜，乃聯合國機構政治安全委會委員五十四人當前最重要之問題，故而美國「諒」將反對英方建議，亦即蘇方要求之「就地」調查軍力辦法。聞美國感覺調查軍力建議，若經通過，則限制軍隊大問題，勢將無限期展緩討論。</p>

<p>四外長獲協議</p>
<p>〔國新聞社紐約廿五日電〕四外長今日舉行短時間會議，在蘇外長莫洛托夫讓步下，就特港地位問題，成立　　協議數點。但重要問題如外國軍隊自特港撤退，義對希南兩國之賠款及義國境內盟國僑民損失之賠償等，仍懸而未決。四外長會議前，美蘇兩外長曾作秘密會談一小時，特別討論義大利和的各點。聞莫洛托夫曾向貝爾納斯保證，四外長會議遲遲不進，並非蘇聯存心妨礙，事實適得其反，蘇聯亟欲迅速成立協議云。</p>

<p>〔路透社開羅廿六日電〕薛特基總理昨發表公報，譴責過去數日內開羅所發生之暴行。當局已在全市各校捕獲肇事學生六十名公報復謂：政府已令警察雖在挑撥之下亦不可妄動，但在必要時得使用武力，以制止暴行。此次暴動有政治團體背景，並供給金錢及武器。此次示威之目的，意在迫使政府辭職，或使英埃談判不得要領而止。亞歷山大今日亦有學生示威暴動事，軍警奉令出動戒備。亞歷山大及開羅均已宣布爲英軍禁入區。開羅英軍總部昨午夜後不久被人投擲炸彈一枚，僅將門戶炸毀，餘無甚損失。此外竟日尚稱安定，惟空氣仍極緊張。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅廿五日電〕埃及會議定明日舉行秘密會議，屆時將由政府報告內閣一總理薛特基赴英談判修的之經過情形。埃政府若能獲得大多數議員贊成，則外長即將前往倫敦敦，與英國簽訂新的，再呈請議會批准。</p>

<h3>中日經濟開始爭霸　我工商界應注意　美支援下日絲將獨占世界市場</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電）曼却斯特導報著文稱：日本現正奠定其爲亞洲主要製浩及輸出國之基礎。一九四六年八月底，適値戰爭結束後一年，日本對外貿易出超已達五一·七九二·〇〇〇日圓（合八五七·〇〇〇英鎊）。年內日本輸出價值二五·二四一·〇〇〇鎊之生絲，錫，鉛，茶葉，半橡皮，銻等，輸入價値二四·三八四·〇〇〇鎊之原棉及糧食。盟軍最高統帥部雖聲明聯合國任何會員國均可中請准與日本貿易，但截至目前止，日本所有之進口貨幾全部由美國供給，同時日本出口貨百分之六十七六係由美國購買。在未來之一切計劃中，當推紡織計劃最爲完備，切要。此項計劃一經實現，則亞洲各國人士將重穿日本製造之衣服，爲期常不在遠矣。日本現已從事輸出生絲及蠶絲出品，不久更將輸出棉紗及布疋至亞洲各國。據官方佔計：日本至多在三年以內，將恢復其戰前在遠東市塲之地位，至一九五一年，日本幾將獨占世界蠶絲市塲。日本原棉百分之五十向係自印度輸入，今則部分來自美國，現已計劃自美進口八九〇。〇〇〇包。因人工缺乏，本年底前產量將較預期者爲低，但至一九四七年日本，將有過剩紗布以供輸出至緬甸，馬來，東印度及印度。日本將可獲得國外借款，作爲輸入糧食及償付佔領費之用。盟軍總部官員咸信彼等之計劃雖有人反對，仍當推行無阻，且謂中國建議在十年以內禁止日本從軍國外貿易，殊爲可笑。彼等對巾國能否在十年以內在紡織界取日本之地位而代之，表示懷疑，並謂無論如何，亞洲人民不能長期等待討着之　入也。英美及印度紡織商或將提出更强有力之反響，但因彼等現無暇及此，故此項反響在二三年以內不致發生效果。孟却斯特導報讀稱：日本蠶絲業之計劃，較之棉織業尤爲遠大。按世界將來之蠶絲需求量的爲每年三千萬磅，但盟軍總部擬使日本在一九五一年生產三千五百萬磅，實際上獨占世界市塲。一九四〇年日本蠶絲產量接近九千五百萬磅其中約半數輸出國外。戰爭結束時，日本每年祇能生產約一千三百五十萬磅。目前生產逐漸增加，但因乾繭缺乏，今冬產量或將降低，明年初期收繭後當可增加。官方對中國絲業雖極表同情，但對中國之請求婉言拒絕；當局私自承認：除撥給乾繭，蠶種或桑秧外，不擬以機器或其他任何物品協助中國。彼等認爲中國目前尚不能節約使用乾滿，中國教府僅希望阻止日本將乾　　製生絲，並銷售國外。該導報結論稱：中國與日本間之經濟爭覇似又開始，然日本仍將居於上風也云。</p>
<p>日工商相談稱經濟前途樂觀</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿六日電〕日本工商大臣星島昨向日本財政家多人談稱：日本經濟情形可許樂觀，下半年度煤斤之出產，可達三千萬噸，紡績業照預定計劃進行，每一紡織廠棉花來源充裕。　錢業已自賠償名册中抽出，故不久即可活動。賠償問題雖仍在在，但經濟界之　　工作已完成，將來和平會議舉行時，全國將再度團結一致云。</p>

<h3>勤政親民　市長出巡　抽查戶口　會蒞娼門訪問慰諭毋須驚惶　見到市民貧富懸殊情形深致感慨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕是昨天的淸早，細雨迷蒙，天氣是險沉沉的。</p>
<p>貴州路老閘分局，第二區區公所中的空氣，却比往常更顯得活躍，辦事人員個個都興奮熱烈。唯一的刺激，是市長將來實地調查的信息。他們並不是想「討好上司」，但是，經過長期的辛勤工作後，一旦能够蒙受長官的靑睞，誰都免不了有一分喜悅的情緒。</p>
<p>區長室中，正副區長李汝椿，王承雄期待着。一個月來，他們是無時無刻不盼望著吳市長蒞臨的。　時間一分一秒地過去，紙烟熄而復燃，而吳市長却還不到來。市長原預定八時半先赴二區視察，再赴第十一區。况且平時絲毫不脫時間，今天的例外，不由人不懷疑。幸而，這個疑團，不久就給汽車喇叭聲打消了。吳市長笑嘻嘻地跨下汽車說：「已經先赴新成區視察去了。」</p>
<p>接着，吳市長說：「區長，請你陪我到人口最密集，里弄最飾　的地方去，我要抽查戶口！」</p>
<p>老者打躬作揖　連稱「好市長」</p>
<p>「篤，篤，篤！」吳市長挑中了北京東路宏興里四號，搗著後門問道：「我們是來調查戶口的，裏面有人哦？」　這是一幢兩上兩下的舊式弄條房子，裏面黑黜黜的，光綫似乎不很充足，大門口掛着「永利紗織廠事務所」的招牌，已經剝落了，事務所中，也沒有辦公的樣子，只是三三兩兩穿着短打的工友，在翻閱報紙。還有幾個剛會呀呀學語的孩子，在地上爬。看見一大堆陌生人走近的時候，睜大了小眼睛，大呌「爸爸！……」</p>
<p>這一家的戶長周祥炳已經出去了，吳市長耐心地對一個職工解釋明白後，說：「你先不要看戶藉牌，試試看把一家的名字報出來，我要查查是否正確。」於是，這個職工兩眼朝天，彎着手指，報着：「老大，老二，老三，……」</p>
<p>正在這時候，住在樓上的房客夫婦聞聲趕下來了。這位先生年的四十開外，兩鬢已斑白，手執戶藉牌，興冲冲地跑到市長面前，先把戶藉牌雙手奉上，然後自我介紹說：「我是黃世濤，這是我內人。」接着便是打拱作揖，最後又是熱烈握手，並用興奮的語調說：「好市長！您眞是民間的市長啊！」</p>
<p>銀行延滯呈報　市長善言規勸</p>
<p>吳市長因爲得到巴川銀行（雲南路貴州路轉角）對於戶口呈報有故意延滯的情報，所以決心親自到巴川銀行抽查並勸導。他說：「我所以要視察區公所，就是爲了要督促辦事人員認眞服務，並喚起市民對於戶口呈報的重視和合作。」</p>
<p>當巴川銀行的工役向經理室通報後，自然吳市長受到了在普通人家所未有的熱烈接待。總經理劉希文茶呀水呀的招待了好一會兒。吳市長連聲說：「不用客氣了，我這是特地來調查戶口的，請你把戶藉牌拿出來。」過了一會兒，一個職工應命照辦，但是拿出來的卻是調查表格，而非戶藉牌。原來到現在爲止，巴川銀行始終未報戶口。據說區公所曾三次婉勸，三次均遭拒絕。</p>
<p>然而吳市長還是客客氣氣地對那個總經理說：「今天我到各區抽查戶口的結果，發覺老百姓都很好，而規模大的商號，就比較不容易推動了。聽說這兒曾三次不報……」吳市長話猶未完，劉總經理便表示十分抱歉，並願立即遵辦。於是一片哈哈聲，大家皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>堪　書寓中人　忸怩不識貴客</p>
<p>第二區第五保中，有一個特點——妓院特別多，因爲人口流動性大，雖然保長胡寳榮極爲盡力，但在辦理戶籍工作時仍有意想不到的困難，所以吳市長今天最後的節目，便是抽查妓院。</p>
<p>雲南中路福裕里九號，門口照例地懸掛着「書寓」的門燈，是宅半新不舊的三上三下住宅。裏面開間很寬闊，總共住了七戶人家，倒有六家是公娼。平素，這些妓院俗稱「長三堂子」，原是高等的狎妓塲所。因是在上午，屋裏黑漆漆的亂做一團。正對大門的是客廳，陳設比較古舊凌亂。兩邊廂房，便是接待賓客的地方，全套紅木傢具，儼然是間最華麗的臥室。這時候，留在房內的，都是些中年婦人。她們正各自工作，有的暸衣服，有的翻絲棉，有的燒飯，有的梳頭……</p>
<p>自然，她們都不認識市長，也決不會想到，有那麼一天，市長竟會突然光臨。戶長趙惠英，張着惺忪的睡眼，一面扭着衣服上的扣子，從後廂房走出來。她用驚異而又害怕的眼光，望着這羣不速之客。市長慈祥地解釋道：「我們是來調查戶口的，但決不與你爲難，也決不罰你，你儘管大胆的說好了，不必驚惶。」</p>
<p>她已是近四十的人了，是選裏的戶長，也就是俗稱「老鴇」的。手下有六七個姑娘，名叫：夏妹妹，李珍珍，楊弟弟，史囡囡　道時候，大門走進一個年的雙十裝飾入時的少女。知道正查戶口，即自報名李二媛，二十一歲，他在這裏主持紅珠書寓的。吳市長便問她：「你這戶中有多少人，把名字報給我聽聽。」那少女忸忸怩怩的回答道：「你呌我說名字，我實在說勿出來，因爲我們平常都呌『阿姨』，『爺叔』格。」是一口軟綿綿的蘇州話。吳市長也就沒有辦法，看看大體上還尚不差，吩咐他們以後有人口流動情形，必須隨時塡報戶口，也就算了。</p>
<p>鴿籠裏住九戶　感慨太不平等</p>
<p>幾個地方抽查下來，時間已近中午。細雨還是不斷地飄飛，路面又是道樣的濘滑，這樣的崎嶇不平，吳市長感慨地說：「敵偽時期的破壞，眞是太可惡了。現在幾條大路已經修理完畢，我們馬上就要動工修理小路了」。</p>
<p>接着，吳市長向記者說：「經過了半夫的視察，對於區公所的戶籍工作覺得十分滿意。環境衛生一方面，則寳在太差。例如垃圾菓皮等，滿街亂丟。自然這也是由於人口密集，而　販不能如期取締等現實條件所限制，只能逐步求其改進」。</p>
<p>最後，吳市長表示非常感慨。爲了他在新成區中看到一家鴿籠似的小屋中，竟住了九戶人家，擁擠和骯髒，實在不堪設想。他說：「中國人眞是太不平等了，有錢的實在太有錢，窮的實在太窮了」！</p>

<h3>四百餘商號情願　減免兩種所得稅　直接稅局逐點闡釋答覆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南京路商號四百餘家，昨日上午九時許，推派代表劉協勛等五人，赴上海直接稅局請願，要求减免徵收薪給報酬所得稅，及證券存款所得稅。當由該局負責人樓國威，帮辦葛延韶，科長余先達等接見，對各該稅課征意義詳加闡釋。</p>
<p>據悉，關於　給報酬所得稅，各商號請求减免之理由如下：（一）自本年一月份迄今，各商號一部份人員已離職，各商號自亦無從代扣。（二）四月十六日財部所發表之所得稅新稅率，所徵頗巨，全數扣繳，影響各職員之生活及工作情緒。直接稅局方面之答復如下：（一）凡已離職者，得予免扣。（二）在職之員工，八月份起之薪給報酬所得稅，即日按照新稅法繳納。至於八月份以前之稅款，分期補扣。詳細分期辦法，以後再辦。</p>
<p>關於證劵存款所得稅，各商號請求减免之理由，亦有二點：（一）目前商號多靠高利貸維持、倘扣繳放款人之所得稅，將影響商號貸款來源。（二）若干債權債務業已結淸，無從扣繳，稅局方面之答覆爲：（一）凡債務未結束者，依銀錢業存款利率，計算其應付利息，作爲扣稅標準，不依黑市利率計算。唯此點係上海直接稅局建議之辦法，須呈請財政部核示後，始能實行。（二）凡債務已結淸者，由各商號將存款人姓名抄送稅局。</p>
<p>最後，稅局方面對各商號代表加以勸導，略謂國家常前財政困難，納稅爲國民光榮義務，並請各代表對稅政推展多予協助，對於商民之困難，決當隨時顧及，並呈報上峯核示。各代表常面表示願即轉知同業而退。</p>

<h3>內河輪船業請　免懲船租所得稅</h3>
<p>本市直接稅局徵收船舶租賃稅，非特稅額鉅大，抑且催徵迫切。江海輪船業公會，先已電請當局免徵，本市內河輸船業公會，亦已快電有關當局，請予免徵，以蘇航商喘息。</p>

<h3>黨員總登記　下月底截止</h3>
<p>市黨部辦理黨員總登記以來，本市黨員前往各指定地點申請登記者極爲踴躍，茲悉：登記限期業已屆滿，本市若干黨員以登記時間較短，辦理不及，紛紛請求再予展期，業將登記時間再予延長至十二月底止。現仍保留第三十三登記處（愛棠路八十號市黨部），以便尚未登記之黨員前往履行登記手續，或用通信方式，索取登記表，塡好後寄回亦可。又此次辦理黨員登記，係以居留上海者爲限。</p>
<h3>茶業組請愿團　要求政府收購</h3>

<h3>市參會二次大會　將審核市府預算　會議日期已決定一周</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第二次大會會議日期，聞僅爲一週，此次討論重心在審核及確定三十六年度市府預算。該會原擬於十二月下旬舉行，茲以國大召開期間，若于參議員不及趕返，故下屆會期一時尚不能決定。如國大結束期早，則該會將於下月底前舉行，否則須延至明年一月間。臨時會址則擇定安和寺路正始中學大禮堂。</p>
<h3>青島市參會呼　兩稅收劃歸地方</h3>

<h3>本年市財政稅收</h3>
<p>仍依參會決定者實施</p>
<p>自最近立法院新稅法通過之後，規定房捐，娛樂捐，筵席捐，營業牌照稅等稅率，均應較目前所徵收之數爲低，記者昨特赴財政局探詢本市今後稅收應如何辦理，並是否遵照新稅法施行，據該負責人談：本市所行之稅收方法及稅率，均由市參議會決議送交施行，市參議會爲人民代表機關，在國父遺敎中已說明，凡地方政治，應由地方自治機關之決策爲原則，中央之命令僅供參酌而已，况是項新稅法尚未經最高國防會議通過，更未有明令到滬，故本年內一切稅收仍當照市參議會所決定者實施，以遵民意，而合地情。再者立法院所通過之新稅法，理論雖是，惟對各地實况未必盡合，如立法院房　規定中有一人或一人以上居住一室者可以免稅，在滬地人多屋少，如上情者佔百分之九十，若可免稅，則房捐徽收事將成問題，其他各捐亦與本市原有規訂相差頗大，如均予實行時，則市府收支將大受影響，故谷局長業已晋京，擬向中央有關當局解釋，請重予考慮以合地情云。</p>

<h3>密勒氏周報鮑威爾談　今日之香港　替代了昔日上海租界</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英文密勒氏評論週報，戰前本由JB鮑威爾氏主編，以筆鋒銳厲，對敲僞抨擊不遺餘力，極受國內外讀者之歡迎。太平洋戰事爆發時鮑氏因事前拒絕撤離上海，遂爲敵軍拘押集中營中，飽經苦辛，雙足之足趾均因凍傷而不得不由醫生鋸去。勝利後，鮑氏因往東京國際軍事法庭作證之便，原擬來滬一晤其闊別多年之故舊，不意在日又因患心臟症而急急返美就診，滬行遂告作罷。現密勒氏評論週報係由其公子JW鮑威爾氏繼續主持。一年來慘澹經營，聞銷數已超過戰前。該社每年出版之中國名人錄（Who　in　china），現亦恢復編輯工作，聞明年三月間，戰後第一集即可問世。</p>
<p>WJ鮑威爾氏最近曾往香港遊歷，昨日曾告記者稱：香港一般情形，較似上海爲佳，衣食價格均較上海便宜。惟房荒亦頗嚴重，頂費押租之風亦盛。目前香港最多者，爲自華東華南一帶前往之各種「難民」。彼等或以政治原因，或因經濟上另有企圖，均以香港爲逋逃之藪。故今日之香港，實已代替昔日之上海租界。馬路上每日可見新張之銀行錢莊，門口滿堆花藍。而彼等於開幕後，實亦並不正式從事經營，蓋彼等之目的，實僅欲掩護國內資金之逃避而已。　鮑氏並稱，其尊人JB鮑威爾氏，現正在華盛頓病院中休養。彼頗希望能於明春重來中國。其健康情形，已較在日本時大有進步。</p>

<h3>破獲製偽鈔機關　在滬杭崇明獲十三犯　抄出偽鈔八百餘萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警察局最近曾破獲一印製中央銀行二千元票面之偽鈔機關，先　在本市·杭州·崇明三地逮捕人犯達十二名，抄出已印就之偽鈔四千〇五十一張，票面共値八百十萬〇二千元，及被埋藏於田閒之僞鈔銅模一付，該案至昨日始告偵訊完畢，全部移送地檢處辦理。</p>
<p>緣有靑年周慕蓮（廿七歲南京人），蔣紉蘭（廿一歲諸暨人），因久賦閒居，乃於本年六月間異想天開，竟集資五百餘萬，計劃僞造法幣，先行在滬託友設法向北海路廿六號藝新製版公司，製就二千元偽鈔版樣，然後携至杭州膺白路十四號，開始試印，惟第一批因印刷糢糊未曾應用，旋經數度改進，於八月間竟至　可亂眞，遂即大量印製，並由王發盟·劉炳生·劉建淸·張榮生等擔任推銷，總計印就之偽鈔票面共計一千五百萬元，直至本月十一日，警局接獲報告會同京滬衛戍司令部上海辦事處組長甘覺等先在湖北路梁溪旅館拘獲王發盟，劉炳生二名，抄出僞鈔一張，經訊問後據供：該劵係自宋公園路六號劉建淸處取來，常即按址前往，在該處樓梯下抄獲僞券一百萬元。據劉供稱：則係警犬訓練所張耀庭所寄存，託代爲出售者，乃於十二日由偵緝課長酈俊厚率領股員任公俠·陳金生，僱員陳先榮，便警許淑田等，密赴河間路六四五號警犬訓練所內，時張耀庭適外出未歸，僅在其宿舍內有名周急之床舖下抄出同樣僞幣一百萬元，當將周急逮捕，並據所中人稱張已二日未歸，惟其友周慕蓮及蔣紉蘭二人則寄居此間，恐與是案有關，故將該二人一併帶局，其時守候於宋公園路六四五號之警員亦已將張耀庭拘獲，一經偵訊，各犯對印製及推銷僞鈔直認不　，並稱印製機關設在杭州膺白路十四號，所有偽鈔已全部携滬，一部份約六百餘萬現藏於廣西路二〇一號顧熊奎家中，至照相銅版係胡挫生介紹，遂於十九日下午八時在吳淞路公安里二弄九十二號將胡拘獲，復據胡之口供，於廿一日派股員陳金山，便警徐有儀赴崇明浜鎭沙溝鄉十保七甲拘獲照相者王志冲一名，其後復陸續拘獲張榮生·顧熊奎·鄭文燦等三名，至照相銅模一副，亦由周等　滬，惟恐事敗，竟投人河間路之小浜內，卒爲警員起出云。</p>

<h3>糧貸案起訴書　全文昨日發表　官商互相勾結　掀起民食狂漲　八被告犯罪嫌疑重大</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕糧貸舞弊案自本年五月間事發後，初由淞滬警備司令部軍法審理，唯該案案情重大，牽涉官商甚多，各方咸加注意；於是該案應由司決審理，抑由軍法審理，曾爭執不決者達數月之久。嗣於十月十七日，始奉最高當局之令，移交本市地檢處依司法程序偵訊。現經承辦檢察官吳啓華月餘之偵查後，業已完竣，被告十人中，除楊錫年李崇年兩人，認爲罪證不足，予以不起訴處分外，其餘汪達人等八人，則依法提起公訴，茲將起訴書全文刋錄如后：</p>

<p>右開被告等因違反非常時期農礦工商管理條例等嫌疑一案（三十五年偵甲字第二四四三，四七一六號），業經偵查終結，認爲應行起訴，茲將犯罪事實及證據幷所犯法條，開列如左：</p>
<p>緣上海市政府於本年二月間召集市商會市臨時參議會及各機關首長會議，討論一般問題，出席會議者一致主張建議政府舉辦糧貸，因上海淪陷多年，糧食買賣被敵統制，原有規模較大信譽較著之糧商組織，摧殘殆盡，收復之初，市民食糧全賴小本商人及單帮小販在附近各地購運供應，並無存儲，其後物價，糧價，工資，運費，相繼高漲，商販資力有限，難於周轉購運，數量因以减少，深恐存底太薄，靑黃不接之際，難乎爲繼，糧食部以扶助糧商增强力量，使克負担民食供應責任，故經令飭上海糧政特派員辦公處會商中國農民銀行（後改由中國銀行承貸）妥擬辦法，迨至四月一日各方催辦甚急，乃由糧食部部長徐堪來滬舉行會議，並親自督促上海糧政處專門委員代理處務汪達人，及糧食部出賦署長李崇年商討草擬上海市糧商貸款辦法，經汪達人任星崖與上海市豆米業公會理事長萬墨林互相勾結，放寬貸商資格，預擬貸商名單，於四月三日提付審核，小組委員會，畏江公司，三泰米行，萬昌米行，萬昌新米行等均順利通過，所有貸商名單及貸款數目爲：</p>
<p>長江公司　王巽之　六千萬元</p>

<p>乾昌裕米行　兪良濟　六千萬元</p>
<p>恒泰豐米行　張　超　六千萬元</p>
<p>廣業公司　金志封　六千萬元</p>
<p>（緣因手續未辦妥故未貸得）</p>
<p>志　豐米行　徐泰元　六千萬元</p>
<p>協昌泰米行　祝世祿　六千萬元</p>
<p>會　豐公司　汪玉振　六千萬元</p>
<p>通　益公司　陸麟勳　六千萬元江北公司邢頌文六千萬元</p>
<p>復　康米行　邵季高　四千萬元</p>
<h3>糧官放任　糧商囤積　食米飛躍　怨民飛騰</h3>
<p>除廣業公司後因未辦手續未領貸款，新昌米行等十三家無犯罪證據外，長江公司王巽之莊漢章，三泰米行吳蓉生，萬昌米行萬墨林等，藉此囤米壟斷，操縱米市，豆米業公會常務理事邢志剛申貸未遂，有將暴露糧貸秘密之意，萬墨林彌縫無術，乃以萬昌新米行貸得之米款，於未經該主管官署核准擅自與楊潤畬商得同意，轉讓邢志剛，仍以萬昌新名義領取貸款，汪達人任星崖消極不予干涉，致在貸款期中上海糧價突然狂漲，數日之間，食米飛躍，逾三萬餘元，中外側目，民怨沸騰，監察院江蘇監察區監察使程中行。即飭派科長暨調查員多人，分向糧政處豆米業公會及承貸糧款之公司行號澈查眞相，認爲上海市糧政特派員楊錫志，糧政處專門委員代理處務汪達人，調節科科長任星崖，暨糧食部田賦署署長李崇年等，均係違法失職，向行政院提出糾舉，共涉及刑事份部，並函請本院偵查，淞滬警備司令部據稽查處本年六月亦查得長江公司王巽之，及該公司業務主任莊漢章，三十泰米行吳蓉生等，又有囤糧圖利罪嫌，均曾加以逮捕，並於本年十月十七日移送人犯卷宗到案。</p>
<h3>王巽之　裝袋上綫　故意操縱</h3>
<p>查被告王巽之，現任長江公司副總經理，兼厚生公司經理，因曾任財政部國庫署副署長，及浙江專賣局長，故與現任糧政人員素有交誼，被告除以厚生公司名義向浙江貸得糧款一萬五千萬元外，又在本市於糧貸開始時，以長江公司名義貸得糧款六千萬元，於四月十四日領得貸款後，即至　涇蕪湖等地採運，四月二十四日其第一次從楓涇採運之米糧計三百五十一擔半，業已到滬時，糧價高漲，被告爲囤積居奇，延不赴市出售，並將續來米糧，均人會存儲，至五月十四日，共有存糧一千八百四十七石半，經促令出售，始售去六百九十六石，核其情節，不特違反糧貸辦法等，三條第十三條之規定，且顯有投機操縱行爲，應依非常時期農礦工商管理條例三十一條從嚴科處，被告雖一再辯稱：四月二十四日到米三百五十一石半，我照手續塡表報告糧政處，至廿六日通知准賣，不料於二十七日起市場混亂，沒有發售，爲辯解要知被告與現任糧政人員均甚相　，故能在江浙兩處均貸得糧款，爲數甚鉅，安有於四月二十四日糧到後不准即售之理，即退一步言，被告於　月二十四日糧到後，亦應於當日塡表呈報，二十五日亦可應市出售，何至於廿六日方接准賣通知，顯見飾調圖卸，無足採信，其不隨到隨賣，反欲裝袋縫口，運輸上棧等，以備囤　，殊有故意操縱米價之嫌，除主管機關應依照非常時　取締日用重要物品　　居　辦法第十八條沒收其囤積物品外，被告犯罪證據，已甚明確，即應從嚴處斷，被告莊漢　爲該長江公司之業務主任。採運出售均須由其負責經營，茲竟共同囤積，置調節科所批一立即出售不准入倉」，於不顧應負帮助違反非常時期農礦工商管理條例第三十一條罪責。</p>
<h3>拋售公米與米號　吳蓉生假公濟私</h3>
<p>三泰米行吳蓉生，於四月二十九日因　益公司低價售米，引起風潮，糧政當局因恐商人繼續停市，影饗人心，經請示行政院宋院長，決定一面佈告停售貸商米糧，一面諭令糧政處在軍糧項下撥米三萬石以爲恢復市塲交易，穩定糧　之用，爲避免政府售糧起見，命三泰米行吳蓉生，協大亨米行馮鏞聲，以各該行名義在市出售，所撥國際米廠如工之白米，計自四月二十九日起至五月九日止，共交三泰米行轉倉之米一萬一千包，此係政府不得已之緊急措施，被告奉命辦理應如何黽勉從事，奉公守法，拋售公米與米號，以便實銷，而安人心，乃被告吳蓉生竟將一千一百九十三包，合一千四百零七石，銷售同行，使該米名雖賣出，實則仍留於米行，有違市塲營業規則，顯係壟斷操縱米市，核其行爲實有違反非常時期農礦工商管理條例第三十一條之罪嫌。</p>
<h3>萬墨林　部分</h3>
<p>被告萬墨林，係豆米業公會理事長，其經營之米行，計有萬昌。萬昌新·及三泰米行之一部份，而此三家米行均經列入糧貸，無一譴　，其初即有憑藉特殊地位，攫取糧貸利益之心，今於糧米到滬後，在其萬昌米行銷售日記簿內又有售米與萬昌米號之記載顯係托名銷售，而實際仍由其支配，以達囤積居奇之目的。計賣與萬昌米號四月二十三日五十石，五月十七日二百二十五石，又批與萬昌者計四月二十八日六十五石，五月十五日三百十七石七斗七升九合，共有六百五十七石七斗七升九合之多。又被告呈報糧政處到糧總數爲一千九百五十二石八斗，較進貨數量尚少五十石，而銷糧總數爲一千三百二十二石八斗，與前項總銷額計漏報達六百三十石之多，殊有囤積嫌疑，亦應依照非常時期農礦工商管理條例第三十一條治以適當罪刑。</p>
<h3>冒用萬昌新名義　刑志剛領取貸款</h3>
<p>被告邢志剛，因辦理軍糧不力，未能交齊米糧，經糧貸審核小組會議剔除，後又與楊潤　萬墨林勾結，冒用萬昌新名義，領取貸款，殊非正當商人應有之行爲，核有刑法第三百三十九條第二項之罪嫌。被告楊潤　爲萬昌新經理，萬墨林爲萬昌新店主，未經主管機關核准，擅將萬昌新貸得之米款六千萬元，轉讓邢志剛，業於在偵查時供認不諱，是該被告以他人犯罪之意思而有帮助其行爲，而其行爲係搆成犯罪要件之行爲，應認爲上開犯罪之共同正犯，亦請判處適常刑罰。</p>
<p>查糧政處特派員楊錫志，於本年三月十四日乘機飛美，奉派出席國際會議期內，被告汪達人係上海實際負責糧政之要員，勾結豆米業公會理事長萬墨林，介紹長江公司王巽之作糧食貸款之貸戶，而該公司竟囤積　斷，王巽之吳蓉生　與被告素相友好，被告之職務爲上海糧政之主管人員，在法律上有防止之義務，且能防止而不加以防止，坐令商儈圃稽，而使民食飛漲，其以消極行爲助成王巽之等之犯罪，實屬無可解免，應負帮助他人違反非常時期農礦工商管理條例第三十一條之罪責，並應依照刑法第十五條及同法第三條第一百三十四條處斷。</p>
<h3>糧價狂漲　任星崖應負責</h3>
<p>被告任星崖，係糧政處調節科長，調節民食，管制米糧，均係其應負責，今在其舉辦糧貸時期，米價因糧商採運來源暢通，原應下降，而反呈狂漲，顯有奸商操縱，市儈囤積所致，長江公司三泰米行等囤積居奇之情形，業如上述，而該主管之調節科在法律上均有防止之義務，今竟放任，不加干涉，縱未能證實其有共同圖利而帮助他人壟斷操縱，實應負帮助違反農礦工商管理條例第三十一條之罪，請依刑法第十五條第三十條第一百三十四條處以罪刑。</p>
<p>綜上所述，右開被告等犯罪嫌疑重大、應請依法處斷，除被告楊錫志李崇年罪嫌不足，與貸商朱永明等均乏罪證，應分別不起訴外，合依刑事訴訟法第二百三十條第一項提起公訴。此致本院刑事庭，上海地方法院檢察官吳啓華。中華民國三十五年十一月二十三日。</p>
<h3>瑞士人魏特勒　被控間諜罪　高院昨初審　詢及密碼　說是輸盤賭　力言購自蒙城　當庭大談賭經</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕端士人魏特勒Eily　Widler，現年五十八歲，近被淞滬警備司令部之Eddie　Lee，指控偽造美鈔美幣及郵票，並販售　銅予日人，自日軍部領得通行證，担任間諜工作，魏當即由該部拘送本市高等法院檢察處辦理，經該處偵查終結，於十月二十六日提起公訴。起訴書指魏素充敵海軍及憲兵隊間諜，專司拍攝有利敵方照片及秘密通訊工作，民國卅年間復串通日冠將吾國中央造幣廠存滬托美商茂生公司American　Trabing　Company保管之紫銅等材料盜賣資敵，被告對充任問諜一節雖狡不承認，但查核卷內有敵上海海軍特別陸戰隊特務班第三艦隊司令部，上海憲兵隊本部，日本帝國陸海軍大村花房等發給被告通行　影航行等特別許可證，並有密電碼三木，顯有觸犯黨懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第四款第七款之罪嫌，合依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條刑事訴訟法第二百卅條第一項提起公訴。</p>
<p>該案昨日下午由高院開庭初審，魏由法警提押到庭，衣小格黃色上裝，灰法繭絨西褲，黃皮鞋，禿頂，頷下蓄有濃鬚，以英語答問。供稱：自幼生長上海，經</p>

<p>南通人吳永華，前在滬開設利華汽車五金行，售賣汽車零件及五金等物。勝利後，被人檢舉，指吳於卅一年九月出任偽汽車拆配零件業同業公會理事長，利用地位，爲敵軍部搜購摩托車及五金用品，並將汽車引擎重價轉售於敵，以爲製造自殺艦隊之用，敵人投降前，本尚有三百輛訂售於廠方，後因戰事結束，尚未交貨。由淞滬警備司令部稽查處拘送高院，該案昨日上午已辯論終結，定十二月三日上午宣判。</p>
<p>泥水匠薛阿四·王金生兩人，被控爲敵軍構築軍事工程，昨日審結，亦定十二月三日宣判。</p>
<h3>調查四案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高院昨開庭調查漢奸嫌疑案多起：（一）</p>
<p>范存正</p>
<p>現年二十八歲。被上海縣臨時參議會撿舉，指曾充任敵憲兵隊密探及僞北橋區公所指導員。被告否認曾充任敵憲密探，担任偽保甲指導員則有其事，但謂參加馬丁行動總隊，係奉令掩護地下工作者。更滿口愛國與抗戰之詞。並稱此次被檢舉，實因拒絕受縣府李科長之賄。發生衝突，而有以致之云。臨參會議長黃蘊深到庭則稱：有人由臨參會告密，乃提出檢舉，此係參議會大衆之意。詢畢後，被告向檢舉人拱手言曰：「謝謝老先生，給我到此地來得一個敎訓。」檢舉人點頭唯唯，（二）恒安造船廠經理</p>
<p>鄭良斌</p>
<p>被控曾任僞中央政治委員會外交委員及敵偽合辦之中華輪船公司常務理事兼船舶部長等職，被告否認曾爲敵担任造船工作等事。（三）</p>
<p>王震</p>
<p>衹控曾任浦東敵憲兵于隊翻譯，浦東偵緝隊長，東昌路警察分局長，洋涇分局長等職。被告否認有助敵爲，傳調查，皆有利被告。（四）</p>
<p>白俄</p>
<p>潘林亞歷山大，被控在敵憲兵隊任職，作不利於我國之行爲，被告否認，以上各案均改期再訊營地產業，前住本市佑尼干路二百八十四號，庭上以報載指有通敵情事見示，魏閱後稱此爲</p>
<p>故意誣陷</p>
<p>以冀獲得財產，因本人居屋佔地廿五畝，寬廣精美，庭上繼詢：「民國廿六廿七年間你得中跑馬頭彩，即購一游艇出游，行至吳淞口外遇颶風沉沒，幸爲日人救起，即去日本住半年多？」魏答：「除得中頭彩爲事實外，其他皆爲虛構」。問及將中央造幣廠存滬託美商茂生公司保管之紫銅盜賣事，魏答：「此爲茂生公司出賣於日人，有茂生之函件可證，爲廿九年至卅年間之事，當時全部價値法幣四百萬元，本人曾得佣金二十萬元，但係自美商處獲得，出售所得之四百萬元則由</p>
<p>茂生公司</p>
<p>委託上海有利銀行匪至紐約總公司，之後聞言卅年間茂生又將款匯予中國政府，但數目不詳。」庭上聞言即稱：「中央造幣廠曾致函淞滬警備司令部稽查處，聲稱並未收到此款。」魏答：「此與我無關係。」繼詢向敵軍部領得特別通行證，充任間諜事。魏答：「當時淪陷區之外僑，皆可得此證件，本人雖獲允許拍攝新聞照，但實際始終未拍過。」庭上乃問以三本密電碼何用？魏稱：「此非密碼，而爲西洋輪盤賭之號碼。由歐洲蒙特卡羅城出版，去函購得，作爲私人</p>
<p>游戲消遣</p>
<p>用，研究能打中那一門，但至今尚未完成此工作」。言畢又詳加解釋如何利用以作游戲賭博。並稱：「將此視作密碼，即爲無常識之人。」審訊告一段落後，魏即向庭上聲述被捕時被取去金錶二只，金戒二只，金條一根，美金五千元及汽車一輛，至今辦公處又爲封存佔住，警備司令部將我名譽毀懷，初控我僞造美鈔，但查無實據，現又控我間諜罪嫌云云。並要求准予釋放。庭上答以：「交保需具書面狀聲請，待合議庭評議裁定，非常庭即可釋放。」言畢諭令改期再訊。魏與家屬接談後，仍由法警押回監獄。</p>

<h3>央行施展壓力　金價漲勢稍挫　配給之外再拋六千條　美鈔黑市亦連帶回小</h3>
<p>烚赤昨續趨高翔，但高後顯多彈性，晨開二六九萬二有買，人心仍俏，賞銷及證劵帮有納，立即穿出二七〇萬大關，求方甚爲興奮，一再步升，十時後央行以二七三萬二五之價，配給五〇〇條，高價曾漲到二七四萬五光景，央行逢高力拋，漲勢被阻而回落，浮多亦　　脫手，午刻退入二七〇萬以下，午後人心更平，經央行在午前力售六千條後，買戶興趣見减，續告微挫，與前收相較，無甚榮辱，飾金紋銀均平，銀元稍升，暗拆尚平，息價仍在一角二至一角半之間。</p>
<p>據熟悉市塲情形者談：黃金漲勢之不易阻遏，主因有兩：（一）外埠金價較本市爲高，尤以香港爲甚，故黃金轉口之情形，勢所難免。（二）央行雖不斷拋出，但商業銀行銀根漸鬆，市面之游資亦甚多，遂集中於黃金之購買。而金價之上漲，如以拆息計算，爲大一分有餘，實爲最穩妥之投資。故觀察今後金價之趨勢，欲恢復漲風未起前之水準，恐不可能云。</p>

<p>據實業界人士稱，本市工業約有一百二十餘種，本年度各工業狀况，大部份均受高利貸與高工資影饗，成本激增，而實銷不暢，故虧蝕累累，僅棉紗與橡膠兩工業，猶能獲利，蓋因料充沛，進價低廉，尤其橡膠業，更能獨占鷔頭，因其對於各地經售商店，均有預定配貨之合的，以實銷之盛衰，隨時申請增减，故其配售市價，亦依此升降，各廠商之生產量，均能依各地商店之需求，供應裕如，該業約計三十餘家，以大中華橡膠廠，爲此中翹楚，定價之升降，均以該廠爲依歸。</p>

<h3>僑匯多轉往香港　港粵間大規模走私</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上月份僑匯總額爲法幣七，〇二六，三八〇，四一九·九六元；內紐約匯款爲法幣三，九三八，一二四，五〇八·三五元及美金七八，九七九·一〇元，超過半數以上。六個月來僑匯數字顯呈减少之趨勢，據專家分析其原因，主要者有兩點：（一）美元之法定匯率與黑價相去甚遠。僑胞如自海外以美元直匯祖國，則只能以三三五〇之比率兌付，反之，如匯寄香港，再以港幣折合，顯較有利。加以國內政局不安，生產萎縮，而港埠之外商銀行又以高利率引誘，故有相當數量之僑匯，已落入港埠外國銀行手中。（二）目下港粤之間，有大規模走私存在，亟需美元匯票付款，不惜出高價收買。於是一部份僑匯，遂消耗於此種非法交易中。至於補救之道，當局已在硏究，以常識推斷，不外兩點：一爲塡塞香港之漏扈，此則需要外交上之努力，同時對於僑匯之匯率，尚須有優待辦法。二爲嚴厲取締港粤間之大規模走私，因僑匯約有半數爲匯至廣東者，故走私之消滅，對於增加僑匯爲不可少之步驟。</p>
<h3>英商眾業公所　不易移港復業　外股過戶在辦理中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市在戰前經營外股買賣之英商衆業公所，目前正在淸理過程中。因我國證劵交易所之成立，衆業公所決定解散。公所原有經紀人九十餘名，華洋各半。現華籍經紀人已全部加入證交工作；至於外籍經紀人方面，則動向不一。當勝利之初，公所經理巴文道即因家事關係，首途赴英，故公所淸理之工作，即交與副理實台克主持進行。其餘外籍經紀人，去秋赴英倫者不少。另有一批，則赴香港另謀發展。另有一小部份外籍經紀人，則已以公司之名義，加入我國證交活動。目前公所淸理工作巾之主要業務，爲各種外股之過戶。經過敵僞八年之盤據、產權凌亂，故過戶時特別愼重。又上海之衆業公所，亦不能移至香港復業。因港埠已有兩個經營股票買賣之機構，一爲香港衆業公所，一爲香港股份有限公司。將來兩者將予合併，然後復業，但時期尚米定。</p>
<h3>白桐油漢電突漲</h3>
<p>白桐油外銷雖未通暢，而產地反逐步見漲，近接漢口來電：謂已售開每市桶十二萬五千元。衡之前市，竟漲起萬元以上。似乎出於意料，以常情而論，對外貿易爲匯率所限，確難合算。惟聞近來出口多從香港方面轉運外洋，大槪出黑市結匯，漢市之漲，或由於此。惟申市毫無辦法，致久無對外交易，眞可謂望洋興歎也。因漢市旣漲，內銷雖是落令之際，不能不隨聲附和，各號批售亦加至十三萬六千元，銷極淸淡。</p>
<p>洪江桐油銷非其時，本來冬令，從前正備春銷之際，但近因拆息過大，早備力有不逮，大槪須到臨銷而辦。各牌西副售盤亦隨白桐油稍增每桶爲十一萬五六千元云。</p>
<h3>今日開幕　蠶種改良設計會　主要三議題將提會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本定昨日舉行之蠶種改良設計委員會，因籌備時間不足，決定改於二十七日舉行。該會之主要議題有三：（一）我國採用歐洲系統蠶種問題。世界之蠶種有三個系統：一爲歐洲系統，特點爲絲量多而體質較弱；一＼爲中國系統，特點爲絲量少而體質較强；此外尚有日本系統，介乎兩者之間。爲一國絲業之長期發展着想，以採川歐洲系統爲有利。將來我國如採用歐洲系統，尚可利用多種方法，在若千年之後，使歐洲系統之蠶種體質轉强。關於此點，民間意見與官方相同。（二）我國各地育蠶之設備，有過於簡陋者，不適宜於良種之發育，將來擬由中蠶，民間代表及農部人員合組一調查團，視察各地之機塲，如有不合標準者，將禁止其繼續使用。此項問題，亦將在此次會議中詳加商討。（三）我國之育蠶條例，訂定已久，因客觀情况之變更，若干點已不適用，有加以修正之必要。此次會議中，對此亦將詳加硏究。</p>
<h3>英紡織專家談改良蠶絲</h3>
<p>英商業訪華團團員紡織業專家溫博登，曾赴日本考察蠶絲復興現狀，已於日前抵滬，據稱：日本蠶絲戰時破壞不多，目前已在積極恢復原狀中，中國素爲蠶絲國家，其會品在國際素有相當地位，但如不能改良品種，减低成本，則難與日本抗衡，日本蠶絲業之所以能迅速恢復，不外品種較優，設備又屬現代化，生產量較多等原因，故欲挽救中國蠶絲業之危機，溫氏認爲第一步當將土種减少，以新方法繅絲，第二步，蠶繭之賣買，應以乾繭替代鮮繭爲標準，蓋鮮繭不易決定其繅絲之品質，乾繭可隨時抽絲檢騐，而決定其品質優良與否也。</p>
<h3>絲價不易提高</h3>
<p>江浙生絲成本，每担已達七百萬元之請，中信局收購價，最高祇五百萬元，繅絲業不堪賠累，中信局負責人表示，絲業界之痛苦，自應予以同情，但政府之困難，亦應顧及，春絲尚未收完，秋絲並未開始，將來絲價是否再有變更，須待政府決定云。</p>
<h3>日絲產量增加</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京廿五日電〕據日本農林省生絲局統計月報稱：九月份日本生絲生產量計八·九九二包，較八月份略增。但九月份新裝置之繅絲盆遠較上月爲多，幾增三倍。絲織品之產量仍未見增加，因紡織廠正在趕造指定出口之一批絲貨。</p>
<h3>埃及擬向法義德國　推銷長纎維棉花</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕埃及政府擬在法國，波蘭，義大利及捷克各國覓取市塲，以推銷埃及長纖維棉花，致引起一種謠傳，謂埃及可能向倫敦方面舉債，以達到此項目的。但英國棉花同業對此擬議，嚴詞指摘謂第一，此項借款爲數當有二千萬鎊之鉅，其結果勢必造成不利於英國棉花業之棉價；第二，此項借款勢必加深埃及國內通貨膨脹之趨勢。</p>

<p>寒風凛冽中的受難者，需要一場溫暖。一次的政治性集會，像撒下一次充滿希望的種子一樣，多少人等待着它茁壯的成長，從綠陰下找尋一塲眞正的歡笑，一些人愛沒有果實的花朶，更多人　無花的果實，這就是廣西人對廣西政治的期望。</p>
<p>張發奎主任在廣州　（木報記者攝）</p>
<h3>張發奎將軍　回到了第一故鄉</h3>
<p>省地方行政會議帶給人民的自然應該是人民的心事底兌現。三年來荒蕪了的檢討更新工作，到今天才在一個廢墟上由一百多個父母官淸理。人·時·地·三重的滄桑，加重了會議的意義，廣州行轅主任張發奎將軍在十多萬市民熱愛的歡迎下，回到了他底「第一故鄉」（這是將軍自己的說話，從將軍的百戰身世看來，太値得回味了）在桂林逗留了三日，出席了行政會議，召開了綏靖會議，在廣西的軍政兩路口放下一盞明燈，使張將軍感到無比欣愉的不是高聳的彩松牌坊，盛大的宴會和「榮譽市民」的獻請，「蘇市長請張將軍做桂林的榮譽市民，張將軍一笑而道，「廣西是我的故鄉，桂林我也有屋子，我早就是桂林的市民，」。却是廣西一年來埋頭重建的成績，和拙樸的「廣西精神」，一直到他離開桂林，轉赴桂東南視察，臨行前的說話，還給予了廣西子弟無限的鼓勵，行政會議諸公也就在鼓勵下面熱烈的開展了會議的工作，　蔣主席對年來廣西治安安定的讀賞，使到更多的人注目到這一片寗靜的土地，行政會議開幕日，賢明的蔣主席更剴切地指示：「桂省於抗戰期間，貢獻至多，犧牲亦鉅，勝利以還，地方之瘡痍未復，人民之疾苦待蘇，各級行政人員對安定秩序，組訓民衆，普及敎育，推行合作，促進建設諸端，均應注意，切實辦理」言簡意賅，成爲會議的中心準繩，省當局揭藥了「在建設中講生養，從進步中求安定」的口號，黃主席要會員「痛加撿討」，要「知無不言，言無不盡」，因爲會議有時候往往是一朶沒有果實的鮮花，高調的演奏會，自吹自擂的把戲塲，怕人民頭痛，自然最好少說不痛不癢的話，黃主席看得到，算是替國家確實支配了二千多萬大會經費的用途和十日會期，珍貴的時間。專員和縣長訂下了四條會員公約；要「踴躍建議，實心檢討，珍惜時間，减免應酬」（自然有時候也不免送一點「特產」也不免一兩個縣太爺化了裝去尋尋花問問柳）眞做得到，也就是會議收獲了一半·幾日來緊張的集會和集團生活的訓練，證明朝氣依舊遍滿整個廣西的火地，「幹部決定一切」，行政會議決定了廣西的新生。</p>
<p>整個重建廣西的計劃，省當局宣明是依據六全大會的決策進行，還有，政治要民主，經濟要民主，敎育也要民主，所以行政會議是民主的行政會議，民主建設的熱浪裏，記者願從一斑之窺中寫出一點並不値得輕視的事實，報道民主路上廣西人的苦痛。</p>
<h3>縣長受懲戒人數　佔百份之八十光景</h3>
<p>三年來，正如黃主席所說「廣西遭受了最慘痛的變故，空前的戰禍破壞，空前的災荒飢饉，不但本省的多年建設已毀於一旦，同時整個社會亦成了一座殘破的廢墟」。政治上，從戰爭期的禍亂相尋，各自爲雄的局面收拾起而至趨返安定，中間曾經經歷了多少無可奈何的殺戮，梟吏從肆燄而歸於歛跡，又經歷了多少的整頓和澄淸，人悄和法理不能並立時候的搏鬥，「政權系統」的樹立……寫下來眞是一部趣味的故事。至於今日的政治，上了軌道幾分？自然稱譽時可以盡情的値得讚美，譬如治安工作的進步，地方機構的健全，人事制度的優良……一直數下去，幾乎無美不臻，有善皆備，偶然「實心檢討」起來，有時亦還有値得商議的餘地，應該說不上的總不能錦上添花。記得監委白鵬飛（桂籍）曾經說過，「近來的縣長不把幾個併做一個，建得有資格做父母官，」有趣的統計圖表載明，卅四年底止，廣西現任縣長受懲戒人數佔百分之七九·二〇，這是政府的評價，至於「幹部」們者百姓心目中的評價，自然又當別論，進深一層看，治安工作好，還要更問一問保養生息，减政親民；地方機構健全，更要問一問，行政效率；人事制度還要問一問選賢與能……說來話長，一番雄論彷彿不着邊際，其實總不會算空穴來風，謎底便擺在謎面上，如此而已。</p>

<h3>建設廳長講窮話　以呌化子頭自況</h3>
<p>建設，在廣西是一件無比艱困的工作，重建一切，是一千三百多萬人的一致要求，然而今日的境地，可以用「人財兩空，工商凋蔽」八個字寫出了這邊省的痛苦，除了人才簡直是想無可想而外，無論一切待興而又告停的事業，莫不如克魯塞維茲對戰爭要素的看法：「第一要錢，第二要錢，第三還是要錢。」不說別的，從財政上看，十月份已盡，經費還沒有着落，弄到一切措施陷人了麻庳的狀態，以至有建設應長向張發奎將軍訴說他自己是「呌化子頭」的說話，交通要修復，請款請不來，興建農田水利，救濟總署是「力有餘而心不足」不願帮忙，建設的事彷彿只是廣西的家務，政府完全疏忽了或者說是偏重了，一部分省的建設工作，是不可諱言的事實。財政收支系統改訂以後，簡直是提襟見肘，廣西貧瘠的縣份每月的全部收入，說起來眞感到悵惘，不過只是二百萬塊錢（如鎭結，憑祥等縣）比不上海上富翁一席酒菜，因而需要省款補助的，竟達三十餘市縣，合需八億三千餘萬，上拉下扯，建設二字就從中魂飛魄散，變了五日京兆，地方收入旣少，於是便花樣百出，弄到大洧「而今只是屁無捐」之狀。行政會議上，陽廳長報告的地方租捐便達十一種，人民如何擔負得了</p>
<h3>農村復員什不得一</h3>
<p>建設的基本離不了農村的復興，廣西的農村復員者，「十而未得其一，」再加上重重的壓榨「其一」也差不多要倒下來，農民的最大痛苦，莫逾於于因地權而發生的剝削榨取，二五减租省令秋前辦竣，實報換的的縣份不過卅六個（廣西有一百縣市（是不是眞做到了，還有問題，未報換約的縣份近七十縣，便說明了地方的黑暗勢力怎樣欺凌着愚昧的農民。此外廣西的田賦總額在民初是二百五十萬元，到卅二年突然增到了七百八十萬元，加以征借和附加，數目的擔負是一個天文數字，屢經請求减免，皆無效果。而湖南一請便請去了四分之一，這些事情，有時候總使廣西人覺得有點悲哀。農村破產，談甚麼建設？所以行政會上對於建設的問題彷彿都有一種深思和焦慮，一致認定除了自力更生以外，別無他途。譬如開荒，各縣的荒地不下四十萬畝，而放墾者只是五萬畝。興辦水利，除了富庶的縣份人民自動修建外，談不上頂好的成績，坦白的說，人財缺乏是原因，負責的人不負責也是原因。</p>
<p>對工商業的扶助，行政會議尚無具體的辦法，不過扶助的前題，黃主席曾經說過：「目前廣西的私人資本仍很單薄，未到節制階段，相反地應該予以獎勵。」這總算是一種辦法，然而私人資本在廣西而言，也許可能首先助長官僚資本的出路，要不然，偌大的「貿易公司」如何辦？執政者有一番苦心，現實又是一層暗影，工商業振興還要從政治着手</p>
<p>積極的建設是救濟人民最好的道路，行政會議便是建設新廣西的搖籃，佈滿了飢荒和貧困的大地，人們在屛聲息氣等待着燦欄的花朵結成茁壯的果實，幾日來父母官們在訴着窮，訴着苦，也提出了珍貴的辦理，可寳的意見，黯淡是一面，光明也是一面，現在正是光明和黑暗搏鬥的時候！</p>
<p>附帶一個有趣的插曲，便是行政會議前張主任蒞桂之後，省當局曾召集各機關首長向張主任報告行政工作的困難，每一個都毫不掩飾地報上一個「窮」字，張主任表示了莫大的同情，如修復公路，免裁東鬧等廿六縣電訊局等請求，都答應立刻轉中樞有關部門辦理，只有救濟分署黃榮華長署報告輸運救濟物資沒有船的時候，却給張將軍說一句「你報告不老實，你說沒有船，跟我到廣州去要。」黃署長連聲「謝謝主任。」黃署長謝謝主任，桂林東江鎭的難民也「謝謝主任」，張將軍路過難民收容所，一下子便贈給他們三十萬元，難民歡天歡地，黃署長不知作何感想？</p>
<p>還有行政會議開幕時，聯總代表胡培德先生的演說裏面有「是吾糧食都到飢餓的人手上呢，只有諸君才曉得，因爲各位都是親民之官」之語，殊足發人深省，姑錄以爲「救濟閒話」。</p>
<p>上帝敎信徒「收那些羔羊」，廣西的飢民比羔羊更和善，願行政會議閉幕後，有一百個和善的牧者，快快把羔羊帶出苦海！（廿五日寄）</p>
<h3>五權憲法與英美憲法的比較</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>國民大會已於今日在首都正式開幕了，它的任務，是在制定憲法。這次所討論的憲法藍本，乃是二十五年所公佈而經最近修改訂正過的五五憲章修正稿，換句話說，就是一部包含着五權分立精神的憲法。五權憲法本是國父所首創，也是他一貫的立國理想所貫注。國父晚年所手訂的建國大綱第一條中即規定「國民政府本革命之三民主義五權憲法以建設中華民國」，可見五權憲法的實行和三民主義的理想是不可分的。</p>
<p>近代歐美各國的憲法，大都採襲傳統的三權分立的制度，原則上旣不完備，實施時更多流弊。國父經多年的悉心硏究，採擇其優點，矯正其缺陷，並根據新的思想和學理，針對中國立國的實際需要，創出了五權憲法。</p>
<p>五權憲法和英美各國的憲法都是不同的。它的特點在那裏。爲什麽五權憲法優於三權分立的憲法？本文就預備就道問題作一個比較性的硏究。</p>
<p>先說英國：英國是憲政的先進國家，其憲政的發展，逐步演進，已有七八百年的歷史。但也正因爲英國的憲政是一步步演化過來的，所以英國至今並沒有一部獨立完整的法典，因爲這緣故，一般人稱英國的憲法爲「不成文憲法」。在英國史上，許多有名的文件都構成着憲法的一部分，例如一二一五年有名的大憲章，一六二八年的權利請願書，一六八九年的權利法案，一七〇〇年的王位繼娥法，以及一八三二，一八六七，一八八四和一九一八年的議會選舉法……等等都是，同時，還有許許多多習慣和判例，也因爲人人遵守，事實上已形成了不成文憲法的一部分，這是英國憲法的一個顯著的特點。例如，英國的內閣如果不得下議院的信任，就應全體辭職，或者請國王解散議會重行選舉，但如果重選出來的議員仍對內閣投不信任票，那末內閣必須辭職。這是行之已久的不變的慣例，但在成文的文件裏，却沒有過一項規定的。正因爲英國的憲法是不成文的，所以也是柔性的，這意思就是說，容易修改的。如關於議會的選舉方法，就曾有過三四次的改變，而後才形成了今日的普選制度。新的文件和慣例可以自然地代替了舊的，而成爲不成文憲法中的一部份，並不需要經過麻煩的憲法修改手續。</p>
<p>英國是一個君主立憲國家，所以在名義上，英王是總攬着立法，司法和行政之天權的，但實際上，正如人所週知，英王並沒有什麽眞正的權力，因爲立法權是在議會，（法律通過後須送請國王批准，但這只不過是個形式），司法權在法院，（雖然判決書上必用「代表國王陞下」的名義），而行政權則在內閣。內閣的首相是多數黨的領袖，閣員皆由首相選擇，一切政策由內閣決定。</p>
<p>這種責任內閣制是英國憲政的中心精神。在責任內閣制之下，立法權和行政權是互相依傍的，但同時也是互相牽制的。內閣的工作是在執行各種政務，而首相和閣員事實上又都是議會的議員，可以出席議會，參加討論表決，所以立法權和行政權是互相依傍的。但另一方面，議會如果不滿意內閣的所作所爲，就可以提出不信任案，强迫內閣總辭職。內閣也可以請求國王解散議會，以資對抗。在這裏，議會不單是一個立法的機關而巳，它同時還是個代表民意的機關。如果內閣覺得議會的不信任案並不能代表民意，那末它可以請求國王解散議會，由選民重選議員。可見一切的決定仍然是在選民，不是在國王，不是在首相，也不是在那些一意孤行的議員。這就是英國憲政下的民主精神。</p>
<p>議會原應該是高於一切的，它可以制定新法律，也可以修改或者廢止任何舊法律，它可以對負責行政的內閣提不信任案，强迫內閣辭職，它也可以提出質問，個別彈劾議員，或者否決政府所提出的法案。所以，就表面上看，議會似乎是控制着一切的。但事實上，內閣中的首相乃是議會多數黨的領袖，由於現代政黨組織和運用的日趨嚴密，內閣其實已可以在許多地方控制議會。因爲首相旣是多歟黨的領袖，閣員又都是多數黨的議員，那末內閣在議會所提出的法案，事實上必可得到議會中自己一黨（即多數黨）的支持，即使反對黨起來阻梗，法案也還是可以通得過。在這種情形下，行政權顯然是會壓倒了立法權的，</p>
<p>英國的憲政方式，當然有它特殊的優點，不過我們不要忘記，這是它們經過七八百年來的改進演變而得來的，而中國的憲政運動，才不過三四十年的歷史，人民一般的知識水準，也還不及英國，應用不成文的柔性憲法，事實上是不可能的。所以五權憲法應當是一部剛性的成文法典。說到憲政的實施，英國的責任內閣制中，立法權和行政權很難截然分立而求取平衡，結果不是弄到議會無權，就是政府無能，這和國父的理想都是不合的，所以國民大會制和五院制也正可以補救這個缺點。五院中的行政院僅行使行政權，而絕不能控制立法權，同時，它也不受立法權的箝制，這點是比責任內閣制進步得多的。另一方面，五權憲法下權和能的劃分非常淸楚，人民有權控制政府，而政府也可以充份發揮行政的能力。此外，關於人民的權利，五權憲法中亦有極明確的規定，列入於成文的法典之內。可見五權憲法是具有英國憲政的優點而沒有英國憲政的缺點的。</p>
<p>其次說到美國：美國的憲政歷史，當然較英國要遲得多。一七七六年七月四日發表了世界著名的「獨立宣言」，次年頒布了「聯盟的法」，這是美國憲法的前驅。一七八七年，各州的代表舉行憲法會議於賓夕法尼亞州之費城，是年九月十七日完成草案，次年經各州通過，一七八九年，聯邦政府乃依照新憲法而成立。</p>
<p>美國憲法的性質，和英國憲法恰恰相反，是成文的也是剛性的憲法。美國憲法全文只有七條，除第五第六及第七條外餘每條各分若干節。憲法全文共只四千餘字，實在是世界各國中最簡短的憲法。雖然共只四千字，但道部憲法中關於聯邦立法，司法及行政權的實施，聯邦中央與各邦（即州）之間的關係，憲法的修改，以及人民自由權利的規定等等，都已包括在內了。</p>
<p>憲法如此簡單，固然可以淸淸楚楚，但因此伸縮性也就不得不相當大，有若干事情，就都只能以一向的慣例來輔佐憲法之不足。例如美國的總統不得連任三屆，這在憲法上原並無此規定，不過因爲歷來的總統都未嘗連任過三屆，所以這就成了一種慣例了。但羅斯福總統因爲得人民的擁護愛戴，就打破了道個慣例，被選連任到四屆之多。</p>
<p>美國憲法是極顯著的三權分立的憲法：行政權屬總統，立法權屬國會，司法權屬最高法院，互相有所牽制，即同時也能得到平衡。總統是國家名義上同時也是實際上的元首（這和英國的情形是很不同的），總統決定政策，對議會不負政策上的責任。所以，在美國的憲法制度下，行政權和立法權是完全分開的，議會對於總統和國務員的彈劾只能限於違法行爲，至於政策上，議會即使不滿意也只能由它，沒有像英國那樣的投不信任票的辦法。美國的總統四年一選，議會如果對總統不滿，也只能到四年滿期後別再讓他連任，但在他四年在位的任期中，是沒有什麽眞正的辦法可以對付的。</p>
<p>美國是一個聯邦國家，它的憲法所以也是「二重憲法」，而不是「單一憲法」，換句話說，聯邦有聯邦的憲法，各邦（州）也有各邦（州）的憲法。聯邦政府有它單獨的權限，如軍事外交等等，而各邦政府也有它單獨的權限，如敎育警察等等。憲法中聯邦的權限是採列舉式的，而於各邦的權限則是採槪括式的。說到司法，聯邦有聯邦法院，各邦有各邦法院，組織各不相同。就整個的趨勢看，美國憲法是偏向於地方分權的，這一點，是由於美國制憲的歷史使然。美國是光有各邦而後才組織聯邦的，就次序上說，聯邦的權限乃是由各邦分出來的，因此地方分權的色彩，在美國的憲法中自然特別濃厚。</p>
<p>美國的憲法中，而且也充滿着對於個人自由保障的重視。因爲一般國家中憲法對於個人自由的保障，只不過是對行政權而言，至於立法機關，則旣是代表着民意，理論上自應有權制定法律限制人民的自由。但美國一七八九年的憲法修正案中即曾加入人民權利一章，其中限制國會制定千涉人民自由的法律。而南北戰爭以後，又增加了三條，禁止各邦制定限制人民權利的法律。這是各國憲法中所不常見的。</p>
<p>不過美國憲法的精神，其主要的出發點乃是聯邦的政制。中國旣一向是一個統一的，單一的國家，這樣的憲法，許多方面自然不能適用。至於中央和地方的分權問題，五權憲法中亦已同樣有此規定。說到五權憲法中的五院制，就其總統與行政院的組織關係上看，似乎很像英國的責任內閣制；但從總統民選和總統所擁有的權力一點上看，則又極像美國式的總絲制。其實，五權憲法是兼有這兩者之長的。再就立法權和行政權的相互關係上說，五院制下的立法權和行政權，旣不是像責任內閣制那樣地合而爲一，也不是像總統制那樣地各自分離，而是立法，行政，司法，考試，監察五權都能有獨立而關聯的運用。最重要的，五權憲法中主張權能分開，使政權和治權不致有所混淆，這是比三權憲法的美國憲法要進步而合理得多的。</p>
<p>所以五權憲法，在精神上，目標上，辦法上，重點上，都和世界上傳統的三權憲法很不一樣的。中國的制憲工作進行得比較遲，遲也有它的好處，那就是容易採用各國憲法的優點，由於人家行施時所獲得的經騐，而謀取適當的補救。我們如果研究歐美各憲政先進國家的歷史，就很可以看出，一個國家憲法的特殊性質，定必有着它立國和實際需要的根本原因在，所以單一國家也不一定都採用集櫂，例如英國；而聯邦國家也不一定都採用分權，例如蘇聯。明白了這個事實，我們就可以知道，憲法不是可以抄襲模倣得來的，而必須依據本國不同的歷史和國情而制定。在五權憲法下，人民有權控制政府，因此政府可以萬能而不致獨裁。而中央與地方的權限，旣不採集權，亦不採分權，而只就事務上實際的需要而作劃分，如此可以得到集權和分權的好處，而不致有兩者相互牽掣的流弊。這是五權的精神，也是五權憲法爲其他國家憲法所不及的地方。</p>

<h3>荷蘭菊展</h3>
<p>— 十八日萊汀航訊　本報特約記者往仁</p>
<p>荷人以善栽花　聲全世界，一九四六年秋舉行於萊汀Leiden市會　之菊花展賽，乃戰後復典之一番盛事，會期達七日，蒞觀者一萬二千人。</p>
<p>菊自東土遠　，歐洲所習見者，向分大小兩種，大種先來自日本，淸康熙間即有之，西人以其裨藥療而能治子宮抽搐，臘丁萬名曰子宮車Matricaria，荷名或曰母草Moedekruid，適與吾華『女花』之名成巧　對，聞今荷人所展賽之大小諸菊，率由中國至，小種乃於淸乾隆十五年由遠遊亞洲之荷植物家貞榦Rumphius携來，最初所得，祗有黃色一種，故其時瑞典Linne奈氏所定通行全世界之希臘文學名曰金花Chrys　anthemum，此猶東方詩人詠菊者之　曰金英，厥後產自中國之大種菊花，復於淸道光二十八年，由英人福氏Fortune移送英國，不久經法國而傳至荷國，而荷人之於菊，早於光緒六年，作第一次之展賽矣。</p>
<p>中國菊之在歐洲，距今百年以前，不過四五十種，自道光二十三年求得接Ln—oculate，能因人巧奪天工，所得變種之花，名色日繁，品類日富，如英國五后Queen。of　England胡省王　Prince　of　Wales　人安妮Annie　Salter等種種異稱，大抵爲蒔花者之名或爲顯者名與婦人名，無意義之可尋，非若中國酌定新名詞之善於運用詞采，而有御袍喻黃，　　御白，艶陽喻紅，楊妃喻淡紅，諸妙稱之動人美感。</p>
<p>方今華人在海外，地位日見加高，似此與我中國最有歷史關係之菊花展賽，西方人爭說東方故實，得其道而神其用，可成天造地設之國際美談，是會旣終，經過六百三十　之推選，決定以大種白菊之名歐士愛娣Editon　Alston者，爲全塲最美之花，偶成詠白菊詩兩首以誌慶，不敢與白樂大爭尖也，詩云；「色色離芳晚景幽，黃金國土壯神州，追求免被西風誤，送老晴光到白頭。夢寐在花萬古心，滬增園地小窗深，而今國養翻新樣，貴過黃金見白金·」（白金根據希臘學名，即白菊花之代名詞，滬壖園地，指二十七年前徐家匯路十六號舊居。）</p>
<h3>貧血的粵省教育</h3>
<p>— 廿二日廣州航訊　本報特派員　梁風</p>
<p>學校太少　要讀書的人真多</p>
<p>廣州市現有的人口是一百二十萬，可是學校有多少呢？公立中學才得九校，私立中學有二十間，一共也不過容學生二萬數千餘人；小學方面，市小比上學期增加了二十二校，共有六十四校，私立小學大的有八百閒左右，合起來充其量容納五萬人，與最低估計需要就學的人歟，還是相差很遠，因爲求過於供，學校就成爲奇貨，以致弊端叢生，使神聖的敎育變成了商業化，官僚化了。你若想送你的孩子入一間公立學校，不僅要花錢去鑽營，還要去託人情，即是僥倖的過了頭一關得進去，但進了又如何呢？學費不成問題，雜費也不多。可是，書呢？及一套制服呢？這起碼就要萬多塊錢，而平常用的紙簿，筆墨等，平均每天總要花二三百元，假若這個學校是新建的，那連桌椅你都要捐得來，不然就是學校要修建校舍，這筆款子又要從每一個學生家裏募的，或者敎師要向學生借米，而後索性稱爲敬師米，這樣零零碎碎的加起來，一個學生一個學期的用費最低限度要五六萬元，若照目前廣州一般公務員每月所得薪津僅十幾萬元來算，有一個子弟讀書也够你喘息的了。萬一你沒有人事關係，進私立學校又拿不出錢，那也祗好任令失學或就業或從商了，像這樣適齡學子而被這種情形摒棄在學校門外的不知幾許！</p>
<p>至於谷縣的敎育情形怎樣呢？所謂是山高皇帝遠，不管當局怎樣嚴令不得多收學雜費，可是他們仍然是陽奉陰違，任令各鄉村的私塾競收學費，所收的並非二三萬元而是以穀或米作本位，雜費則更附收生油等主要的食品，因此當農村經濟破產之際，讀書就變成多餘的事情了。</p>
<p>本省人口　與學生額的比例</p>
<p>也許你們會懷疑，粤省究竟有多少學校呢？據記者調查，全省專上學校共十叫間，包括國立大學一間，私立大學三間，省立學院兩間，私立學院三間，省立專科及私立專科共五間，容結學生一萬四千餘人，在中等學校方面，有五百五十七間，內包括中學四百四十八間，師範六十四間，職業學校四十五間，學生有十四萬一千四百餘人。至於小學，有二萬二千九百一十七間，其中中心國民學校佔三千三百二十六間，國民學校佔一萬六千六百四十三間，私立小學則有二千九吉四十八間，學生有二百萬人。以上各等學校合計共二萬三千五百八十八間，學生總共也不過二百一十五萬五千四百餘人，若以本省人口比例來計算，則在二百五十人當中，祗得中學生一名，大學生我們更不敢想像了。</p>
<p>此外關於社敎方面，雖然在數目上已較戰前進展，民敎館由七十二所增至八十一所，圖書館由五十四所增至八十五所，體育塲由八十七處增至九十七處，可是實際上的敎育已被人遺忘了，祇是用來做點綴品而已！</p>
<p>學校本身　缺點也不一而足</p>
<p>其實，奧省學校固然少，但學校的本身也有很多缺點：（一）以中等學校來論，師範及職業學校太少，旣無專長，在社會上很難立足，又因師資缺乏，影響下一代國民。（二）爲經費關係，好的敎師請不到，參考書及儀器俱付缺如，使一般學生程度日降，學風囂張，求學精神頹敗。（三）學校變成了商業化，敎育沾染了市儈氣息，更侵入官塲上的敷衍苟且的人情主義。（四）由於學風本身不振，致被奸偽所乘，把握學生爲政爭的工具，學校爲爭奪的塲所，偏動學潮，引起罷課，不少意志薄弱的學子蒙受其害。　像以上的情形，當局不是沒感到這種嚴重性，敎育廳廳長姚寳猷也坦白地承認，各校校舍殘破，設備簡陋，學生體質孱弱，學風不振，程度低落，質素未盡優良等等缺點，可是由於敎育經費的短絀，敎師待遇菲薄，即是巧媳婦也難做無米之炊了。</p>
<p>復員經費　四億圓僅獲零數</p>
<p>也許你們會向中央不是已經撥來本有敎育復員費四億元嗎？是的，省府向中央請撥三十四億元，而核發僅得零數，這數如何分配呢？計：敎育行政一千萬元，專上敎育一億四千六百萬元，中等敎育才五千三百六十萬元，師範敎育一千七百萬元，職業教育一千七百四十萬元，社會敎育一千萬元，科學設備一億四千萬元補助難童敎育，衛生敎育共五百六十八萬元，總共包括九項支出，從上面數字就可以知道各學校所得到的補助希不少了，這樣杯水車薪數量的經費，那能重建學校那能充實學校設備，又怎不使敎育日趨式微？</p>
<p>雖然此間省敎育當局近又對整個敎育訂下七項方針；（一）以師範敎育普及國民敎育。（二）以國民敎育促進地方自治。（三）以國民體育增進民族健康。（四）以職業敎育配合經濟建設。（五）以嚴格管敎養成良好學風。（六）以良好學風轉移社會風氣。（七）以科學研究提高文化水準。以岡補救這表上極度貧血的敎育面臨的危機，可是這不過是治標的方法，對於這一千二百餘萬躑躅街頭的失學靑年如何處置，才是常前最迫切的課題，吾則粤省敎育的前途，文化的趨勢，當不堪毅　！</p>
<h3>走馬看冀東</h3>
<p>— 十九日航訊　本報天津記者李紹林</p>
<p>本月十四日記者獲得一個機會，由天津出發，沿北寗鐵路看了一下冀東的情形，直到山海關才原路折回。在這一次旅行中，曾觀光唐山，漫遊秦皇島，在山海關登眺，在北戴河瀏覽，但是時間是倉促的，我祇能很膚淺的看了看沿路的情形，未及作深入的調查。今年八九月間，是北寗路上最不平靜的時期，共軍對鐵路的破壞，晝夜不停的進行，整個的冀東，瀰漫着烟硝火藥味，九十月間，國軍採取積極行動，各縣縣城相繼收復，在這次視察歸來後，我得到一個概括的印象：是治安大體恢復了，但還不是全面的。</p>
<p>張貴莊　軍糧城</p>
<p>專車離開天津不久，就進入華北重要產米區張貴莊軍糧城地帶，這片水田，一直伸展到塘沽附近海濱的邊緣。這一帶木來是海永浸滲着的　田，但在敵僞時期，日本人開溝渠辦水利，用河水冲洗着把它變成了水田，現在都由我們當局接收過來了。在唐山附近有澗河灌溉，在潔縣附近，有灤河縱流，在昌黎一帶，也有幾條小河在浸潤着，這是冀東富饒的農田區，也是礦產蘊藏最豐之地，雖然已是初冬季節，但是在沿途並不曾覺得寒冷，當火車馳奔旅程上時，憑窗外眺，可以看見秋收後荒涼的原野上，田裏都已長出濃緣的麥苗來，一叢一叢的樹林，也都還掛着一些未被寒風吹落的葉子，許多農民在田間耕作，看來像是非常太平的。</p>
<p>唐山市　工礦業</p>
<p>唐山是個六十方里的城市，隨着開潔煤礦公司的發展而發展，它不過纔有半世紀的歷史，但是現在全市內，已有較大的工礦事業二十多個單位。除了開灤以外，冀北電力公司發電廠，是唐山動力的源泉，鐵路局修車廠，是目前全國最大的可以修造鐵路機車的工廠，啓新洋灰公司是將來國防建設的勁旅，這許多工礦事業構成唐山的生命。</p>
<p>唐山十三萬六千多人口中，有百分之三十九是工人，唐山物價，是直接的隨着天津跳動，百貨去自天津，價格比天津高。食糧較天津便宜，大米和麵粉每斤六百元，猪肉每斤一千六百元，社會中生活最苦的一羣還是公敎人員，待遇低者不過三五萬元，高者十多萬元，一般工人待遇則多半爲十七八萬元，因此工人的服務情形相當好，勞資間沒有嚴重的糾紛。</p>
<p>不凍港　秦皇島</p>
<p>秦皇島風景之幽雅，正如其他臨海的城市一樣，除了値得被鑑賞以外，以不凍港的資格，在今冬它必然還要負起重要的任務，因爲葫蘆島和塘沽凍結後，一切船隻都祇有靠進秦皇島的碼頭來，但是秦皇島祇有兩個碼頭，而且都是開灤煤礦公司的產業，僅能泊船六七艘，要它負起重大的任務，還需要從各方面加强，秦皇島隸屬於臨楡縣，現有人口不過叫萬元，其中開灤公司的裝卸工人佔了五千，現在河北省第一區行政督察專員是駐在秦皇島，專員轄區共有臨檢·撫寗·昌黎·灤縣·遷安·盧龍·樂亭七縣和都山一設治局，督察專員陶新畬說，轄區中有樂亭·都山兩地尚被共軍盤據着，而已收復的各縣，鄉鎭間治安也還不好，今年秋天冀東的農收不錯，但被共軍搜刮殆盡，老百姓却鬧着糧荒，他感到冀東最嚴重的問題是糧食和治安。要維持治安，基本的辦法得加强地方團隊的組織，他說現在的地方團隊急須健全起來。</p>
<p>山海關　北戴河</p>
<p>山海關的氣勢是雄偉的，在朝霧瀰漫中。我走上關頭，縱眼遠眺，看見北面的山峯，像颶風在大海裏掀起的巨浪，連綿不斷，聳立在半天中。萬里長城隱約蜿蜒在上面，向南面看，則是一望無際的大海，關外的東北，使我驚奇起來，是那麽沉靜得令人苦悶。起起伏伏的山巒，似乎是凍結了，更加重了寂寞之感。在歸途中，又漫遊於北戴河三小時，走進冬令的海濱，也祗能給人一些寥落之感。在衝破道寂寞的，祇有尚斷續震動於冀東各地的零星槍聲，但是誰又願意聽這可怕的槍聲呢？</p>

<h3>華府內幕消息：戰爭難避免　美官員說「一天迫近一天」</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室　譯觀察雜誌　克拉普夫人原著</p>
<p>當前世界勢的眞正困難究竟何在？你們應該看一看華盛頓幕後的情形。公務官吏私底下會吿訴你說：另一次戰爭是無可避免的。他們把這種可怕的傾向當做現實看待，但是不敢公開地吿訴美國民衆。</p>
<p>華萊士的批評政府外交政策及其被迫辭去商務部長一職，顯示局勢的嚴重。但是這還不過是困難的一種徵象而已。下面是幾節我所聽到的談話，也可作爲一種參考：</p>
<p>（一）一個自太平洋方面回來的年輕復員軍人的定要去見總統。他想請求總統領導各國主張修改聯合國憲章。總統在最後一分鐘取消了這一個約會，因爲他太忙。其後這個復員軍人碰到了一位總統秘書，他滔滔不絕地講和平計劃應該怎樣才能生効。這位秘書聽得很不耐煩，突然打斷他的說話道：「小伙子，不要胡鬧了。我們隨便什麼時候會和蘇聯打起來的」。</p>
<h3>真刀真槍遲早要打</h3>
<p>（二）最近一個政府官吏對我說：「是的，目前我們正處身於政府戰爭中，猶如一九三九年的時候一樣。我們知道真刀真槍的戰爭一定會來，好比白盡之後一定是黑夜。我們沒有辦法去阻止它，祇覺得它一天迫近一天」</p>
<p>（三）在一個集會上，我聽到一個美國參議員說：東方和西方國家集團之間的間隙，已經太深，無法可以　。我們遲早總要打一下的」。</p>
<p>（四）美國國務院的一個前重要助理承認我們正在進行强權競賽。這種競賽，他嘆息地說，「總是引導到戰爭的路上去的」。他詳細說明「均勢」的觀念，並指出聯合國成功的希望，全　蘇聯和美國意見的一致。可是他接着又使我很震驚地說：似如兩個最强的國家不能站在一起，那麼聯合國就不是爲維護和平而設立的</p>
<p>世界政府　不切實際</p>
<p>假如你天眞地提出世界政府的希望，主張它擁有充份武力，足以防止戰爭的爆發，那麼就有人會笑你「不切實際」。</p>
<p>華盛頓方面很少人　有這種空虚的希望，公務官吏祇不過在口頭上把聯合國讚揚一番。一俟十一月間的國會選舉結束之後，你就可以看到有史以來最激烈的軍備競爭。</p>
<p>不久以前，衆院軍事委員會的六個委員從太平洋方面考察歸來提出警吿說：將來可能發生另一次珍珠港事件。美國空軍將領史巴茲曾經說過美國自北方遭遇空襲的門戶洞開。艾森豪威爾將軍主張組成强有力的陸軍。海軍需要技術人員。</p>
<p>對於戰爭眞正爆發的時期，意見當然不盡一致。某一個發言人深怕一個偶然的事件就足以肇禍，例如最近南斯拉夫擊落美國飛機，不無引起戰爭的可能。但是大多數官吏知道反對民主各國的國家，經濟非常貧困，所以相信距離戰爭爆發之時，尙有五年，十年或二十五年。</p>
<p>美應採取主動</p>
<p>今年是國會選舉年，一九四八年又是總統選舉年。我所以提出這一點，是爲了國內的政治和國家的前途是有密切關係的。極少數的從政者曾經想像到未來的戰爭將旱露怎樣一副面目，就是想像到的人，也不敢坦白地向選民講，因爲他們記得羅斯福總統在一九三七年講了戰爭即將到來之後，在民間引起了怎樣的反感。</p>
<p>但是候選人這種顧慮或許是無須的，許多公民也許願意聽取建設性的意見。就是愚人也知道在未來的戰爭中，首先出擊的國家大致是勝利者。但是這一點對於我國是有困難的。我們自己知道，猶如敵人知這我們一樣，就是美國在侵略方面從沒有採取主動過的。可是科學家吿訴我們我國的城市可以被火箭原子彈在數小時消滅殆盡。美國的人民知道原子彈的秘密別國也可以獲得，而防禦原子彈又是沒有辦法的。然則從美國國家的本質講，我們又不能首先出擊。</p>
<p>美國的人民很明暸這一點。他們變成非常不安，以致日常的生活已經成爲一種慢性的恐怖。在吃飯桌上，事實上在每一種塲所，目前談話的主題，就是第三次世界大戰。</p>
<h3>細菌戰　比原子彈厲害</h3>
<p>我們開始恐懼細菌戰爭，甚至比恐懼原子彈更厲害。細菌戰爭是不需要大量工業的集中工作的，破壞性極强的細菌可能發放到我們那裏來，而事前我們却一無所知。許多人還記得一九一八年的流行性感冒疫病，當時全世界每月平均五十人中死一人，這個死亡率在歷史上是空前的。科學研究所前助理主任却萊博士預料像流行性感冒一樣易於傳染像鼠疫一樣致命的病菌，可以比較原子彈殺死更多的人民。</p>
<p>我們在另一次戰爭中必然是站在遭遇攻擊的前綫。當國務院努力以生命注人聯合國全構，當陸軍從事研究火箭，在北極地帶試騐超級飛機和積聚愿子彈的時候，究竟有沒有人在設計拯救我們的人民呢？</p>
<p>按照憲法的規定，第一個應該負起這個責任的，就是美國總一統。</p>
<h3>七種辦法　總統應實行</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>一個勇敢的總統不應該耐性地坐在華盛頓，祇管空想。他應該行動，就是偶然有越出範困的地方，也在所不顧。他行動的路綫可能像下面這樣：</p>
<p>（一）檢討討蘇聯的整個形勢、去發現他們究竟在計劃些什麼。使用每一種可能的辦法，包括間牒工作在內，去找尋事實。蘇聯已經使用間牒在美國加拿大和英國刺探我們的軍事秘密，爲了維護和平，實無理由反對我們也出此一舉。</p>
<p>假如外交官和情報人員不知道蘇聯究竟在做些什麼，那麼他們就應該得到懲罰，就是國務卿貝爾納斯和參議員范登堡也不能例外。</p>
<p>（二）設計一種和平，而使美蘇兩國在同一個世界中可以友好相處。</p>
<p>（三）要求史達林舉行兩巨頭會議，共同考慮這個計劃。確切地吿訴他和戰就要在這一次會議中決定，而不是在未來許多冗長而無結果會議中決定。</p>
<p>（四）在這次會議中，要有充份的時間可以儘量討論我們的計劃以及蘇聯可能提出的建議。總統在應該讓步的時候可以讓步，不必過份重視國家的自尊，而要現實地考慮任何忠實的議案。但是他必須絕對確定蘇聯所承認的協定或提供的保證，確屬可靠而可以實施的。</p>
<p>（五）在會議前後以及舉行會議的時候，總統應該竭盡所能把每一種進展情形吿訴美國人民；他應該不斷利用無綫電和人民保持聯　。</p>
<p>（站蘇聯可能不能任何不過份　傷美國人情緒的計劃，或許國　覺得和蘇聯擬定的計劃　要美國讓步太多了，那麼總統就應該採取另一種路綫，他應該召集軍事和經濟顧問，請他們擬就對蘇全面戰爭的方案。</p>
<p>（七）促使美國實行六月或一年的動員計劃，規定整頓軍備和動員的確定日期。</p>
<p>假如我們作了一切不損我們國家尊嚴的一切讓步，　蘇聯還是一意孤行，那麼我們將將勿迫向蘇聯提出這個辦法：你得爲和平而讓步一點，不然就打。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，十分之九蘇聯會採取一種更妥協的態度而改變其外交政策。他們甚至可能接受世界政府，使它有充份的力量可以維持和平。這樣我們的立塲就確定了，而目前不可忍受的担心，也可以吿一結束。</p>
<h3>希臘今日　力抗共產主義　邊區砲火連天　面臨三大難題</h3>
<p>— 溪譯自「世界報吿週刊」</p>
<p>希臘政府在英美兩國的支持下，力圖掙扎以維特其東歐最後一個并共產主義國家的地位。國內　攘不安的政局加深了希臘人民的痛苦。希臘是仍被外國軍隊佔領着的唯一戰勝國。希臘的經濟復興較歐洲其他各國爲遲滯，她靠着外界的　濟生存着。保守的政府爲了和共產黨問旋，忽視了人民的自由。</p>
<p>根本地說，希臘面臨着三大問題：（一）全國國結，（二）經濟復興，（三）與東歐及西歐之關係。</p>
<p>團結問題</p>
<p>希臘在一九四〇至四一年的短時其內。曾一度有團結的表現。國王需治二世並沒有促成全國統一的力量。希王在國內並不孚衆望。他第一次在位一年，因叛變案牽涉嫌疑而退位，一九三五年因右派主持下的公民投票勝利而復辟。第二次世界大戰希臘戰敗，希王再度出奔，今年九月一日公民投票，贊成復辟的佔百分之七十五，他又第一一次返國復辟。今日希臘左派人士指責希王對德國佔領時期共產黨翎導下的抗戰集團不予鼓勵，並支持保守黨控制下的希臘政府。</p>
<p>左派聯合陣綫的台柱共產黨對於全國的團結也並無帮助。共產黨在德國佔領時期領導反納粹的地下工作，固然成績昭著，但因其敵視非共黨抗戰團體，並對不加入左派同胞濫施暴行，爲多數希臘國民所鄙視。</p>
<p>自一九四四年十月希臘解放以來，共產黨已經失勢。當英國和希臘軍隊把德軍逐出時，共產黨實際上控制了希臘，但加入得英國認可的聯合政府。一九四四年卒因左派聯合陣綫與希臘右派集團及英軍司令史高皮發生爭執而內戰爆發。希臘政府在史高皮支持下拒絕以中立派人士代　右派總理，左派就在雅典召開民衆大會，以示反抗，民衆與警察開槍互擊，從此內亂日益擴大。</p>
<p>英國首相邱吉爾和外相艾登於一九四四年聖誕節飛往雅典調停希臘內戰。他們曾勸說希臘流亡國王任命達馬斯基諾斯大主敎爲攝政王，以曾在國外居留多年的反帝制人物担任希臘總理。但英國和希臘政府軍隊　　續追擊左派陣綫軍隊，迫至北部國境，一直到簽訂休戰協定時爲止。一九四五年二月十二日在法　閘成立休戰協定，規定共產黨軍隊應即繳出槍械，共產黨和左派聯合陣綫應有合法地位，在一年內舉行選舉及公民投票，以決定希臘政體。</p>
<p>選舉卒於一九四六年三月三十一日舉行，但左派拒絕投票，指責英國主持下的希臘政府恐嚇投票人，不能自由選舉。但英美法　國人士認爲選舉大公無私，英國佔領軍並未加以干涉，左派棄權不致影響選舉結果。</p>
<p>目前的希臘是保王黨的天下。希臘國內多小農民，百分之九十六的農田不到廿五英畝，大多數在十英畝以下。保王黨利用農民對共產主義的恐懼，對他們說：共和政體會把他們的國家變成蘇聯的傀儡政權。同時共產黨繼續對政敵施用暴力，無形中助長了此項反共的宣傳。在這樣的環境之下，今年九月一日公民投票希臘保王鐵的勝利是必然的結果</p>
<p>經濟復興</p>
<p>公民投票不能解決希臘戰後復興問題，希臘是一個赤貧國家，靠着聯合國義後救濟總署的接濟以生存的。到本年年底止，聯總接濟希臘的物品將達美金三萬五千八百萬元，其中半數爲糧食。希臘的糧食供應百分之六十靠聯總接濟。除了聯總的救濟品外，差不多沒有其他的輸入品。政府的歲入至少有半數藉出售救濟品於民衆而得來的。希臘政府祖心　聯總的機構將於本年底結束，於是求出路，想向這轔　出　銀行吿偕一萬五千萬美元，同時希望得到英國的援助。不過，　如聯總　長　加第亞撤銷聯總的建議成爲　實，那　希臘難免　再遭過　個意　的年頭。</p>
<p>希臘已從戰時經濟的崩潰中多少恢復了些元氣。農業生產量巳達平時的百分之几十，明年可能達到　前的水準。工業生產量將近戰　的百分之五十。但是希臘從來　有目給自足過，大量的輸入品仍屬必要的。</p>
<p>希臘的出口業因經濟復興迂緩而無從發展。在戰前，希臘的出口貨以烟草，橄櫈，葡萄爲大宗十大部份輸入　國。目前英美兩國大量收買希臘烟草，但希臘要完全恢復烟草和其他物產的銷塲，必須另外尋求新的出路。希臘商船在大戰中沉失四分之三，予希臘財政以嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>這些經濟的困難足以影響到政治的趨向，旁觀者的見解，覺得　餓綫上的希臘有被迫走上共產主義道途的危險。因此英美兩國當局把希臘經濟復興問題比政治穩定問題看得更重要。他們覺得前者解決以後，後者便可迎刃而解的。</p>
<p>對歐關後</p>
<p>希臘除內政和　　問題外，尙有對歐洲的關係同樣是一個棘手的問題。希臘人曾以活躍的地下戰鬥把　索里尼的侵略軍隊驅回至阿爾巴尼亞境內，力阻德軍的侵入，並牽制德軍數師的兵力。因此希臘希望獲得聯合國的同情，要求向義大利及保加利亞索取賠償，劃割阿爾巴尼亞南部即北伊庇魯斯一條土地，並增强希保邊界。</p>
<p>但是相反地，曾經帮助德人佔領希臘的保加利亞却在蘇聯的鼓勵之下向巴黎和會要求通過希臘而達愛琴海的出路，並且拒絕繳付貽款。同時阿爾巴尼鄧希望蘇聯支持她保持北伊庇魯斯的要求。此外巴黎和會中的蘇聯集團曾指責希臘提出足以引起新戰爭的領土要求。</p>
<p>在希臘國內，各黨政見頗不一致。希臘政府和中立派全力支持保王黨的要求。共產黨初抱溫和態度，旋被嚴勵抨擊後，最後才提出了修改邊界的要求。但是馬其頓的共產黨抱相反態度。希臘右派咸信馬其頓的希臘與保加利亞共產黨之有着密切的聯　。</p>
<p>希臘的根本難題是：她的政府是受英軍支持的右翼政府，在蘇聯勢力下的東歐沒有第二同類的國家。目前希臘保王黨雖佔優勢，但是國內共產鐵的活動以及共產主義國家對其北部邊境的壓力，依然是今日希臘最嚴重的問題。</p>
<h3>美國駐蘇使　史·密·斯　使命重大　左右世局</h3>
<p>美蘇兩國關係的好轉或惡化對於世界的安危的確是息息相通的。從道一點就可以看出美駐蘇大使史密斯將軍任務的重大。巴黎和會開會時，史氏也應美國務卿貝爾納斯之召，出席參與，這是美國政府重視駐蘇大使一職的另一明證。但在和會進行期間美蘇關係的逆轉，勢將使大使未來的工作更形困難，因爲自從他向莫斯科呈遞國書，他所努力爭取的就是要促進美蘇關係的好轉和相互的諒解</p>
<p>但這位曾經担任過艾森　威爾將軍總參謀長的人物，是不容易使他感覺失望的，因爲困難的工作，對他簡直是常事。史密斯作事的不屈不撓，使邱吉爾替他取了一個綽號，呌做「牛犬」（B　ullcog）。他在第二次世界大戰中的經歷，就是一連串困難的任務。自北菲登陸一直到戰勝德國，沒有一樁工作不是艱巨萬分，而他一一把它們服了。</p>
<p>忍耐坦白</p>
<p>史密斯是一個實際主義者，他一開始就感得要使使蘇的任務成功，須得有耐心，時間和坦白的商談。　各方對於史氏是否適宜於祖任駐蘇大使一職，曾有抓種的看法。一般的意見，都認爲他在戰爭的學校中學得了怎樣和蘇聯人相處。此外蘇聯對於戰績卓著的軍人一向另眼相看，而史氏的聲望就够得上這一點</p>
<p>但是這種意見事實上還是次要的。更應該重視的，就是史氏一向以直截爽快著稱，不喜歡用妞妮的外交辭令，這一點，倒也合莫斯科的胃口。此外史密斯還有一種能力，就是叙述一樁事情非常淸楚詳細，這對於一個負責將另一國內的情形報吿自國政府的外交官，也是一抓不可或缺的要素。　史密斯已往的經歷也是出類拔萃的。他担任西方國家總參謀長的時候，對於戰時的世界政軍大勢有極淸楚的認識同時和美，英，法，荷，比，蘇各國的將領接觸極多，一時有軍人外交家之稱。他的同伴常常稱呼他『戰爭的總經理』，艾森豪威爾將軍認之爲『一切參謀長中最好的一個』。</p>
<p>光榮事蹟</p>
<p>在担任總參謀長時，史密斯策劃歐洲登陸以及直搗德國心臟的詳細軍略計劃，在德義兩國的無條件投降書上，他是代表艾森豪威爾將軍簽字的。</p>
<p>史密斯的身材結實，頗有運動家的樣子，棕色的頭髮已經有一點斑白。他說起話來，簡明確切，偶然也會動怒；但總是有節制的。在必要的時候，他可以冷峻無情，但在通常的時候，他總是具有熱烈的同情的。　關於這位軍人外交家的軼事頗少，但是在軍隊中和他同事過的人都知道他有胃潰痬病，所以偶而他脾氣比較暴　一點的時候，人家總替他診斷，而說他的胃病又在發作了。這種胃病對於外交上有什麼作用，果然無從說起，但是有時候爲了避免蘇方宴會中不斷的舉杯勸飲，倒是一種很好的託辭。史密斯對於社交活動，不大感覺興趣，但是對於下棋和橋戲，却極有研究。他處理繁重的軍事工作慣了，所以覺得這種小玩意兒輕而易舉，對手很難應付他。他的太太是一同到莫斯科去的，是一位長長的溫柔的女子。她不大願意拋頭露面，情願讓她的丈夫代表家庭的一切。</p>
<p>對蘇觀感</p>
<p>史密斯對於使蘇幾個月的感想是這樣的：「蘇聯人民是極實際的人民。他們在戰爭的歲月中受苦極深，所以在牽涉到他們本國重要利益的時候，毫不感情用事。他們不願輕易簽訂重要的協定……」。</p>
<p>在巴黎和會結束之後再返莫斯科時，由於國際的環境的關係，他的任務顯然要比以前更繁重更關緊要了。</p>
<p>時事評述</p>
<h3>德國問題的檢討</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>法國爲德國復興而担憂</p>
<p>四國外畏在紐約開會，最重要的任務，除了通過巴黎和會所決定的五國和的草案而外，還有一個最感棘手的問題，就是德國問題，這是歐洲政治的核心，亟待解決，是刻不容緩的了。四國外長會議早就該加以討論，只是因爲法國普選的結果，使法國的政局完全必觀，因此臨時總統　內閣總理暨外長比杜爾，不能離開巴黎一步，以待法國政局的發展。而法國又堅持，在法國外長未抵紐約之前，叫國外長會議僅能就此項問題，作一般性質的討論，而不能有所決定。所以四國外長會議自在紐約開幕以來，還沒有正式討論及德國問題。</p>
<p>貝文計劃要點有六</p>
<p>但是在英國方面。對於德國問題的解決，早就擬定了一個計劃，將由貝文外相向四國外長會議提出，聞其內容要點有六：（一）英國主張，德國應依照一種制度，旣非中央集權制，亦非聯邦制，在政治上及經濟上，獲得統一。（二）英國認爲　國生產量，依照波茨坦協定所規定者，尙嫌不足；故應准許德國每年生產鋼鐵一萬一千噸，以其所得之現金，用以購買食物；（三）在現行賠償計劃之下，不論蘇聯或西方國家，若欲自德國搬走任何工業設備者，英國均表示異議，即使蘇聯提議分期留，英國亦不能贊同。唯有至德國生產增加，足以供給盟軍佔領經費及給養時，英國始能放棄此項見解；（四）英國黨願英兩國佔翎區實行合併，而不願成立協定，使蘇聯在德國依賴英國補助期間，得自德國搬走工業設備，作爲賠償之用。（五）英國仍願在德國統一的機構內，邀詩蘇聯參加管制魯爾區之工業（六）英國擬提議，準備組織德國中央機稱，設立一中央公務員團，得任命地方政府之機關，並在政治上得有採取決定之權，但最後仍須　請佔領各國當局之批准。</p>
<p>法國焦盧德國復興</p>
<p>法國對於德國問題所抱的態度，和上决大戰之後，大體相同；法國日夜所企求的，是法國的安全，時時刻刻所焦慮的，是德國的復與。最近法國駐美大使龐萊在法僑商會演說，也以此爲言。目下法國對於德境蘇聯佔領區內的情形，固然不能認爲滿意，就是對英美兩國佔領區在經濟上實行合併一事，也不能表示同意，尤其是英國將魯爾區出產的煤斤，供給德國的數量，超過供給法國的數量，使佚國朝野一致深表不滿。比社爾政府的外交政策，雖然保持持　超然態度，旣不贊成蘇聯的共產主義，也不滿意英美的帝國主義，不過在事實上，終不免有些偏向於英美方面。但至共產黨秉政之後，法國外交政策的動向，尤爲世人所重視了。法國共產黨領袖多萊士也說，法國的外交政策，乃在防制德國企圖重整軍備，或在經濟上控對歐洲大陸。</p>
<p>聯大工作進展甚緩</p>
<p>聯合國大會於十九日通過了埃及的建議，請各國政府「立即停止宗敎上種族上的歧視」，雖然沒有具體的辦法，但是民族平等的倡導，是値得我們注意的。聯大在這一星期內，集中討論調查各國駐在國外軍隊的問題。中英美法蘇五國的代表，相繼發表演說，闡明各國的見解，莫洛托夫更借題發揮，要求美軍退出中國，並要求英軍退出希臘，因此這個問題，也就成爲美國與蘇聯爭執的焦點。英國雖然提出折衷方案，但仍未能獲得美蘇雙方的贊同。這個問題如何始能獲得解決，實在是聯合國大會當前的一大考騐。（十一月廿五日）</p>

<h3>酒</h3>
<p>— 耶草</p>
<p>隨着國家的復員，我們也在復員了。帶着簡單的行裝，從作爲抗戰根據地的山城，到了曾經住過二十餘年而又一別九載的上海。</p>
<p>八一三之夜，因爲去接無錫惠山療養院的病中的四叔，在南站上了火車，由嘉興轉蘇州，約了霞光三哥同到無錫。短短的路程，走了將近三日，那種擁擠的苦味，今生真不願再嘗試第二次。回到蘇州，住在三哥家，法籍嫂嫂招待很是周到。我們等候着回滬的火車。</p>
<p>在蘇州，我們初次看到大羣敵機俯衝轟炸，恐怖的夜裏，密集掃射！當時，誰也不曉得畏懼，靜觀着飛機的來去，和高射炮的彈花的爆炸。幾座橋樑炸斷了，蘇滬間的火車不通，我們商量的結果，決定回到故鄉去，參加抗戰的營陣。</p>
<p>這個九年，我們跑到洛陽，跑到重慶，跑到西安，跑到多山的立煌，幾乎沒有一年不逃難，家燬了，再重新建立起來，時時受死亡的壓迫，天天被生活所折磨，然而，我們活得却很有勁兒，樂觀的兢兢業業的活下去。生命力的倔強是從來沒有的，三叔父一家人被炸死完了，我們一點不難過，我們爲他舉行了簡單的葬儀，我們祗知道要復仇，一心一意將鬼子趕出國境。我們只有一個信念，相信鬼子早晚必被攆走。只有一個理想，勝利了我們就有辦法了。回到第二故鄉的上海，住着比較寬敞的房子，買一百扎以上的稿紙，寫起我們苦難的經歷，用勞力養活自己。</p>
<p>我們畢竟勝利了，同時也回到了上海。但房子給朋友住上了，朋友沒有力量去頂房子，祗有讓他住下去，我們自己，也只有借住朋友的房子，慢慢的等待着。</p>
<p>在一個報館裏做點事，待遇原是可以維持五口之家的，可是現在，一個人也不夠用了。誰也不知將怎樣的活下去，妻勸我造一個預算，我苦笑着，倒勸她僅可能的節約。九年來我們是在節約中活下來的。</p>
<p>民國三十年後，我們的營養一年不如一年，妻兒皆常年多病，使人懊喪。如果想醫治疾病，休想再活下去，吃飯便成了問題，疾病只有聽他疾病，祗有將來再談了。</p>
<p>妻抱怨着，孩子不斷的啼哭，長期的，像是再不會有盡頭，起初，我還安慰他們幾句，漸漸的，我絕望了；我已經聲嘶力竭，我再沒有力量拯救他們。他們能活到幾時呢？祗有天才曉得了！</p>
<p>我失去了生活理想，却沒有方法超脫這一個境界，又不能不活下去；首先，我得安置一下我自己，有什麽方法使我看不到，有什麽方法使我聽不着呢？我學會了喝酒—這是我生平最討厭的東西！</p>
<p>酒啊，你是我消愁的良伴，我深怕你將使我滅忙！</p>
<h3>聽音樂訪問團臨別演奏</h3>
<p>— 梁酉廷</p>
<p>這一陣，上海的音樂聽衆，聽到了不少音樂名手出國的臨別演奏。從斯義桂，郎毓秀，高芝蘭的獨唱會，以至日前的音樂訪問團臨別表演，雖然，這之中，毀譽參半，但不管如何，這總是上海樂運的蓬勃的一面。</p>
<p>有人說，這是上海樂運的迴光返照，因爲他（她）們都一個一個的溜光了，今後上海，除了市府交響樂團與尚在壯大中的上海音樂社外，樂人是越來越少了。不過，我們似乎總應該往好的方面想：他（她）們大概不至於不想歸來的，同時，上海還有許多比較後進的樂人，大可趁此機會，慢慢地提高其技藝與地位。</p>
<p>因此，這次我們聽音樂訪問團的臨別表演，雖不勝依依之感，但也帶着慶幸的情緒；因爲我們希望這些人到國外去宣揚我們的音樂技藝於先，又帶回了豐滿的收穫於後。</p>
<p>言歸本題，這裏應該說一說音樂訪問團這次的「惜別之曲」。</p>
<p>訪問團的五位團員，除了郁沂祖先生是負管理之責外，其餘都是演奏者：馬思宏，馬思蓀，黄源尹，吳樂懿。這之中，以馬思宏的技藝，爲公認的聖手。大家也許還記得，在工部沒有像小提琴那樣受人歡迎，　局時代，他是交響樂隊的「紅角」。</p>
<p>第一個令人神往的節日——也是作爲這次演奏的序曲——的馬思宏小提琴，拉了三個曲子，都是馬思聰的得意傑作（狂想曲，思鄉曲，蒙古舞曲）；這幾個曲子，尤其是思鄉曲，在馬思宏的演奏中，時常可以聽到，這是他拉得　然的曲子，他閉起了眼睛，讓那「五音　」的東方式的旋律，徐徐地從弦裏浮出，像少女接受情人的熱吻一樣，那演奏的神情，與　當的演奏內容同樣受人欣　。我常覺得，在一個演奏會中，不但欣賞音樂的內容，同時也欣賞着演奏者的神情，你如看過已故波蘭鋼琴家巴特拉斯基（曾做波瀾總統）演的一張影片——「月光曲」的話，你該覺得他在鍵盤前那種吸引人的姿態。在一個成功的表演　，我們看到演奏的人以其所有的生命都交給那隻曲子的時候，實在令人太感動了！</p>
<p>鋼琴獨奏（吳樂懿女士），也許因爲弦樂的「肉感」，更易討巧所致。關於那首賀綠汀的「中西合璧之作」——牧童短笛，我每次聽到都有同樣的感覺，那就是：小用了鋼琴。牧童短笛是個富有東方美的好曲子，然而其全曲結構似不甚適合於鋼琴。更正確地說，它不能表現鋼琴的氣魄。</p>
<p>對於黄源尹的男高音，我有一個也許很膚淺的感覺：他的音量尚不及伍正謙。易言之，黄先生的音量略嫌小了一些，這在上次訪問團在京表演的時候，就有人這樣批評。「教我如何不想他」最高音只不過F昇高半音，這對於一個好的Tenor該是滿不在乎的，但黄先生覺得吃力了。如果以音色，音量，音域表情四者分別來批評黄先生的獨唱，則可以這樣說：表情有餘，音域不夠，音量嫌小，音色頗園轉，只是受了音域不夠廣闊的影響，到了最高音部份，其音色略嫌有些不夠光滑。</p>
<p>還有附帶「吹毛」的一點：「教我如何不想他」似乎是劉半農做的詞，音訪團兩次節目單中都寫爲「胡適」，我想代胡適先生否認一下。</p>
<h3>嘉陵江散抄</h3>
<p>— 臧贊</p>
<p>小鳥</p>
<p>一個大霧的早晨。這是冬天的早晨，人們預期着將有太陽出現，唯其太陽必然出現，大霧就　得更加狂妄了，像煤烟一樣向窗內湧進——我打開來迎接太陽的窗戶——隨着大霧的撞入，那就是嘉陵江上的江風，寒冷，窒息。</p>
<p>我在牀上閱讀着阿左林的一篇呌做「撲燈蛾」的短文，正爲那可憐的生命驚奇；爲什麽這一代葬身在火裏，下一代還依然撲上火去呢！</p>
<p>就在這時，突然一個什麽東西撲進我的小屋，撞在牆上又落了下來，掉在牀頭的痰盂裏……等我認這是一隻小鳥時；這鳥已經毫不動彈了。</p>
<p>就怕牠死去，但，我想可能性很少。即刻，我自牀上起來，把痰盂搬到廊下，將水傾出，把那似死的小鳥也倒了出來。</p>
<p>一向我對於鳥知道得太少了。這是一隻比麻雀大一點的鳥，一隻毛羽剛豐的小鳥。我想這一定是一隻鷹同族的鳥，如果長大了的話。</p>
<p>這時，這隻倒在地上，滿沾着冰冷的水，也不閃動翅膀，但確是沒死，看來似乎還在發抖，一隻眼睛不時睜開來張張，看來非常吃力，而另一隻眼邊卻流着血，在眼皮眼球之間，插着一根羽毛，顯然是打過架來的。</p>
<p>霧來的更大了，我急忙回身披上了被　，江上白茫茫的一片亮的發光，船都停止了航行，非常寂寥而且冷靜，死寂得一點聲息也沒有。</p>
<p>我回視這將死的小鳥，覺得只有移牠進屋才有一點希望，雖然屋裏沒有火爐，總可使牠暖和點……可是出乎意想之外，我正伸手去捉牠時，牠卻試着拍起翅膀來了。——牠居然奮力飛了起來，濺我一身污水，我正把牠沒奈何，近乎生氣了，牠卻又撞在牆上落了下來，我連忙再去捉牠，這次，牠沒有再把白牆當做天空，牠飛越出欄杆，向廊外飛去了……。</p>
<p>廊外是一片大霧，發着白光。</p>
<p>立刻我驚覺到，這鳥是沒力遠飛的，一定將跌落在大霧下的江中的；即使任何健全的小鳥，牠也飛不過道江面的。</p>
<p>但，鳥是飛去了，牠只是向下滑翔，並且盡力地向上衝，可是稍微上升一點，接着又向下滑行了……。</p>
<p>我望着牠艱苦地飛着，飛着，向那最亮的地方飛去，一直到那白亮的霧全部將牠盡覆。</p>
<p>……！</p>
<p>這天，一直沒有出太陽</p>
<p>這小鳥與撲燈蛾始終糾纏着我。</p>
<h3>不幸女</h3>
<p>— 西華安德生著　王銳譯</p>
<p>一個從阿峨瓦來芝加哥的女子，在公寓西舍定了一個房間。年約二十七歲，據說她上這個大都市來，爲了進修音樂的教學法。</p>
<p>有一個青年也寄住在公寓西舍。房間的門面對二樓的一個寬長客廳。穿過客廳，就是那女子的房間，房門正與青年的相對。</p>
<p>說道這個青年，就他天性看是溫和的。他是一個畫家，名呌賴洛，但我總以爲他做作家更適宜一些。他談天說地，理解力很強，而作畫並不怎樣出色。</p>
<p>住在兩舍房間的女子，每天總是早出晚歸。她的樣子與每天在大街上來來往往的女人差不多。所不同者，她的脚有點兒瘸。她的右脚生來走了樣，走的時候一拐一拐的。她在公寓裏住了三個月——除了女房東外，她是公寓中唯一的女客－於是公寓中的男子們漸漸對她注意起來。</p>
<p>男子們只談關於她的一件事。當他們在客廳過道上相遇，就在她房間門前止步，笑一笑耳語一下。「她需要一個愛人」，說了以後，做做鬼眼。「她心裏也許不會想到，但她真正需要的是愛人」。一個老芝加哥與芝加哥的男人們總以爲這種事是容易如願以償的。當我的朋友那年輕的賴洛講這個故事給我聽時，我笑了，但他却面無笑容。他搖搖頭。「事情並不這樣容易」，他說。「要真這樣簡單，作家們便無法再寫小說了」。</p>
<p>賴洛還解釋說：「無論何時當一個男人接近她的時候，她便恐懼起來」。他們請她去吃飯，去看戲，但無法引誘她與一個男子在通　大街上並肩步行。晚間她從不上街去。當一個男子在客廳過道止步企圖與她攀談，她起初垂眸向地，然後一溜烟跑進自己的房間。有一個年輕的乾貨商人曾慫恿她與他並坐公寓門前的石階上談話。</p>
<p>他是個熱情的青年，當握住她的手時，她怪聲呌了起來，他慌張站起，以手輕撫她的肩膀，企圖有所解釋，她竟嚇得渾身戰慄起來。「別碰着我」，她呌道，「別讓你的手撫摸我！」她尖聲呌喊時，在道上蹓躂的人們均停步注視。乾貨商人急忙上樓，進自己的房間，閂上門屏息諦聽外面的動靜。當人們責訊時，他以顫抖的口音說：「這真是惡作劇。我並沒有得罪她。她存心找我的麻煩。我并沒有對她放肆過。這真出人意料，我只不過用手指碰了一下她的手膀，這有什麽大不了呢」？</p>
<p>關於這個阿峨瓦女子的故事，賴洛對我也許講過十次以上。公寓裏的男人們於是開始討厭她起來。雖然她對他們不存什麽奢望，而她總不願意他們老是隻身獨處。她繼續與單身男子相處，一碰到她身體的時候，她總聲張抗拒，這種把戲，至少演出了一百次以上了。當她裸體在面對客廳的浴室洗澡時，不管門前經過的男人有多少，她總讓浴室的門半掩半啓。在一樓起坐間，當人們坐在沙發上休憩間談時，她會不聲不響，面對他們坐下。她靠在沙發上，嘴唇微啓，眼睛凝視天花板。她的全生命似乎期待着幸運的降臨。誰都知道她在房間裏的時候，站着的男人們却都裝出仿佛沒有瞧見她的樣子。他們高聲聊天說笑。當大家厭倦到無話可談時，於是他們一個一個，先後悄聲的走出去。</p>
<p>一天晚上房東對這個不幸的女郎下了逐客令。有人，也許就是那個乾貨商人，向女房東搗了鬼，她立刻遵命照辦。「如果你今晚就離開這兒，那就更好」。賴洛聽到女房東這樣說。她站在阿峨瓦女子住的房間門前，女房東的逐客令簡直響徹了全公寓。</p>
<p>高而瘦的畫家賴洛會以他的全生命爲理想而奮鬥。他心靈內的熱情把性的慾求完全昇華了，他的進款小，迄未結婚。也許他從沒有過一個愛人。他并非沒有肉慾，但他認爲肉慾非屬生命第一義的東西。</p>
<p>就在阿峨瓦女人被逐出西舍房間那個晚上，當她等待女房東下樓以後，她就走進賴洛的房間。這大約是下午八時許，他正在對窗做着讀一本書。她開門以前，並不在門上敲幾下。她也不說一句話，直衝到賴洛身前跪下。賴洛說她的扭曲的腿使她跑的時候像一隻受傷的小鳥，她的眼睛燃燒着，氣喘的很急。「擁抱我，」她說時把她的面孔俯靠膝蓋，渾身震顫不已。「快把我擁抱。到了這個年紀也應該結婚了。我不能再等待，你應該立刻佔有我。」</p>
<p>當然你想像得到賴洛這時困窘得不知如何是好。據他對我說，到求婚的悲劇演出那晚爲止，他對那女人平時是漫不經心的。只是我認爲在所有住在公寓裏的男人們當中，他對她是比較能夠一視同仁的。接着房間裏的事態漸漸擴大。女房東闖入賴洛房間，現在兩個女子在他面前，較強的對弱者投射虎視眈眈的眼光，阿峨瓦女人戰戰兢兢跪着，嚇得幾乎在他脚邊縮成一團。賴洛的內心衝動着。他異想天開把手撫按着跪着女人的肩膀，劇烈震撼他。「現在你放心吧」，他急忙說，「我一定會守信的。」於是他轉身向女房東，微笑道：「我們訂了婚啦，」就等着舉行婚禮呢。我們大家吵了嘴。她跪進我的房間偎近我。她的身體不大好，而且心裏激動得利害。我就要把她帶走。請你別着急。我就把她帶走。」</p>
<p>當女人和賴洛離開公寓以後，她便握着他的手，停止哭泣。從前她和單身男子相處時所生的恐懼感也消除了。他在另一家公寓爲她找了一個房間，然後陪她走進公園，坐在一張凳上。他們談到夜晚十二點鐘。從來他和她會見並且談過好多次。感情彷彿沒有什麽進展。她回去了，我猜猜想，她大概是悄悄回到阿峨瓦故鄉！</p>
<h3>秋收</h3>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　105</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這時台上的音樂忽然停止，燈光也亮了一些，舞池裏的伴侶，也紛紛回到原座。這一來，鶴見兩人，都同時感覺有些難於處理了。無巧不巧，就在這時候，領袖的招待，走了上來，躬身報告，說鶴見的司機，已在廳廊上候着。僵局於是打開了。鶴見把「對不起」的一套交際場面方式，表演如儀，暫時告退，却把烟捲，連　留下，代表自己，省得她過分寂寞。</p>
<p>這汽車司機，是鶴見的手下，二十九歲，日本和高　的混血，人物也自一表非凡，沉着機變，公務上是一〇八號一，却不知誰替他起了一個非常不相稱的綽號，呌他「野豬」。</p>
<p>「野豬，你來得妙到無以復加」，鶴見悄聲說着，外表上好像主人吩咐司機言語似的。「東京方面，你是一本百科全書。快點設法到舞廳裏溜溜，門左角，斜對舞池的黑角裏，那就是我的座位，現在有一個　服西裝打扮的女子；我希望知道她一點什麽。快去……回頭仍舊到這裏來找我」。</p>
<p>鶴見穿過一重圓拱門，到酒吧櫃上買了一枝雪茄，又到電話室打了幾個電話，回到廳廊，野豬却早在那裏候着。</p>
<p>「認識嗎？」鶴見問。</p>
<p>「不曾見過」。</p>
<p>「噢……！？」</p>
<p>「聽小綫的報告，她這裏不曾來過，但前月在海軍俱樂部，海陸聯歡會裏，她表演過一節獨唱，名字是萍子，到英國去過三年，英文名字是璐薏，還有一個支那名字呌柳詩，因爲極少傾心支那古詩。父親是仕官出身，中村中校，六年前做過駐英大使一等秘書，前後四年。只有一兒一女；兒子也是仕官出身，現在廣島服務，少尉教官，兼行軍團部參謀官。」——「小綫」是鶴見集團中的隱語，等於眼綫。</p>
<p>「很好！萍子，璐薏，柳詩，……！會唱，怪得聲音那麼受聽；說起話來，像交響樂裏敲着的鋼管琴聲那麼叮叮咚咚地清脆。……可是關於她活動方式的資料，也有些嗎？」</p>
<p>「眼面前，大約是黑龍會裏的特別會員……！可不能確定。」特別會員，不受五級測驗，然而必須自己的親長等，與會中發生過歷史上的關係。</p>
<p>「這就對了……！辛苦了你，外面還有六個朋友等着我們，我不便同他們交手，已經在電話裏吩咐了。十二，呌他前來料理，你把車子停在便利的地點，說不定我就得走了。」</p>
<p>鶴見再度進了舞場，音樂正奏演着風靡了整個三島的「關山夜月」，劇意說明從「夢裏情人」直到「相約自殺」，一段青年戀愛的三部曲。音調柔和幽　，蕩人心魄，也是倣製的西洋華爾滋，不過日本的情調，異常濃厚；全場燈光，比較剛才的探戈，還要幽柔。</p>
<p>「對不起」鶴見似點頭似鞠躬的向萍子告罪，「吩咐車夫幾句，又順便打了兩個電話，竟耽擱了這半天，真是失禮得很」。</p>

<h3>郵費</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>出版界始終沒有好日子過，駡中國出版界貧困的人，曾否深切了解到其中的艱難困苦，實在大成問題。</p>
<p>印刷費就是一副重擔子，壓得出版家透不過氣來，請問兩千字的稿費才能勉强抵得過一千字的排工，出賣知識低賤到這樣程度，我們眞將同聲一夫「斯文掃地」了。所幸紙價尙不昂貴，給大家能鬆一鬆，然而却正在這個關口，郵費却暴跳，突增四倍，這給與所有出版界的打擊太大了。</p>
<p>一木普通的雜誌，定價八百元，假使從上海航空寄到北平或西安，郵費却也需同探的價錢，謂問，這樣的負擔讀者如何能受得了！有人說，爲什麼要航空寄遞呢？答案很簡單，丟開許多地方除去航空別無其它工具可到達外，即使有其它交通工具，在郵局堆集如山的積壓郵包下，在水陸路種種阻礙下，從上海到西安，也許要走上兩個月，請問西安的讀者，有什麼理由要看兩個月前的雜一誌，假使是日報，　更糟糕！</p>
<p>這個打擊，無異縊殺文化的流通，爲普及知識計，我們應該向當局呼籲，請求特別優待出版物，出版物應該例外於此次郵費的加價。</p>
<h3>懶惰人的成就</h3>
<p>— 家經譯</p>
<p>（編者按：本文所述，僅是說明一種人類求便利求進步的心理，與「寄生草」式的眞正懶惰，顯然不同。眞正的懶惰是反進步的！）</p>
<p>首先聲明：我並非一個提倡懶惰的人，由於我們從小就聽慣長輩們向我們講些懶人的故事，他們都認爲懶惰是卑賤的，並且相信懶人永遠不會有發展。但是下面的這簾文章却說人類的進化大部份要靠懶人，這是一篇奇妙的論調，不姑公諸讀者：</p>
<p>（一）這是一個很明顯的事實：婦女的靑春總較男子早逝。無疑的這就因爲一般普通階級的婦女比她們的丈夫來得勤勞，她們情願作習慣的勞動；不作智慧的安逸。</p>
<p>（二）在菜館裏，懶惰的侍者往往最令人滿意，他們把客人所需要的東西一次都搬了出來，以省顧客對他們煩瑣的呼喚。勤勉的侍者，有時送上咖啡，却忘了放糖或忘了帶湯匙，他們情願一次次的跑，待全部俱全時咖啡又冷了！</p>
<p>人類進化</p>
<p>（三）人類的進化差不多全是懶人爲要節省某種步驟而計劃成功的。古時，人類都住在山洞裏，口渴了必須走到很遠的地方找泉水渴，可是較懶的人就想出方法用提桶盛多量的水回家，以後，用竹管從泉源接到屋內；再後來發明了抽水機。</p>
<p>百多年前，有個呌保德（Humdhrey　Potter）的孩子，被僱用坐在蒸汽機旁專門管理每一衝程所排除的廢氣，後來日子久了，做得有些生厭，所以用繩子和門門連接，使活門自動開關，不但省事，並且工作效力增加一倍以上，從他的懶惰中無意間發明了往復活門的原理。</p>
<p>（四）大工程師及生活指導專家吉爾波里斯（E．B．GilPrath）時常愛放映各職業部門熟練工人的電影，而決定一件工作的完成究須多少動作。他發現懶惰的工人，連一個簡單的動作都不浪費，而勤勞者並不注重浪費許多不必要的動作，結果懶惰者倒比勤勞者的工作效率高。</p>
<p>（五）懶人決不浪費寳貴的時光去夢慮着日常生活的動態，他每每靜靜地坐在那兒等候更聰明的思想降臨。</p>
<p>最好的書，多半是懶惰作家的產品，如果這作家太勤勉的話，必日夜渴望着著作的完成，而自己總覺得不滿意的地方太多，所以他必須一次又一次地修改再修改了！他總希望有着優良的調句及出色的情節出現。</p>
<p>吾道不孤</p>
<p>（六）智力上的懶惰也同樣地獲到利益，許多親律和公式都是懶人要代替腦子而定出的，如果沒有落體運動的定律，我們怎麼可以決定一只蘋菓從樹上落下來和兩個小球一只先向上直拋一只後拋相會在什麼時間呢？</p>
<p>懶惰者說：「吾道不孤」！</p>

<h3>自殺</h3>
<p>— 金路</p>
<p>本市自殺案件，據警察局統計室發表：自本年一月起至卞月止，共計發生八三九件。女性佔四九一人，男性三四八人。自殺之原因以家庭糾紛爲最多。目殺者之敎育程度，以受初等敎育及不識字者居首位。</p>
<p>我們看了上表的分析統計，可以推算本市平均每二天有五個半人自殺。我們更可在裏面尋出一個趨勢，那就是敎育程度受的愈高，自殺的把戲玩的愈少。其中最可注意的，倒是自殺的原因：竟以「家庭糾紛」榮居苜位；而且女性多於男性。「淸官難斷家常事」，在我們這一個說舊不舊，話新又談不上的過渡時期的國家裏，家庭料紛，誠然是一椿難以解決的事。</p>
<p>現在，讓我把發生家庭科紛的原因，作一個不離現實的分析：第一是「沒有錢」。在這弱肉强食，粥少佾多，大家搶飯吃的社會中生活，確是不大容易。賺錢的生意，倒並不一定吃力，吃力的生意，却並不一定賺錢。在這物價高漲的當口，丈夫一旦失業，「夫妻」總脫不了「柴米」，「愛情」更不能當「飯吃」爲了柴米，夫妻間的勃谿，時伏時起，悲劇也就在這個時候種了根。第二是「多了錢」，有的男子，在沒錢時，會做一個世界上最好的丈夫，但等一有了幾個臭錢，就同脫僵之馬，在外花天酒地，呼么喝六，早把共患難的黃臉婆丟之九霄。做妻子的一氣之下，尋丈夫翻本又無法時，悲劇也就發生了。</p>
<p>以上二個原因，我是依了自殺者的職業，從事家庭服務及無業者最多而分析的，原因是一而二，二而一的，爲來爲去，還是爲了錢。說實話，家庭中的一切糾紛，就大部分起因於這個「阿堵物」。</p>
<p>但問題不在於錢的本身，一句話：在乎你怎樣處理錢！</p>

<h3>郵話：誰用不着郵票　誰發明了郵票</h3>
<p>— 空眞</p>
<p>這個世界上，除了魯濱遜，誰能不和親戚朋友來往！那麼，書信的傳遞不是要靠那小小的郵票嗎？換句話說，除了魯濱遜，誰都少不了郵票。</p>
<p>郵票的價値已經確定，是我們日常不可以缺少的；所以不妨研究一下。</p>
<p>故事</p>
<p>郵票起源的傳說可多了：有一條據說是最爲可靠，並且是一個富有「蘿蔓蒂克」的故事；在英國有一位少女，長得美極了，於是有很多的人追求她，她每天要接到各地寄來很多求愛的信，那時候郵資是由收信人付的。她所收到這類無聊的信太多了，實在不勝負祖；所以開始拒絕收信。道下子，郵政局（也許另外有什麼名字）可糟了；後來他們的法子也改了由發信人付郵資。</p>
<p>郵票的形狀沒一定，長的，方的，圓的，三角的，祗要是想得出的樣子都有。顏色也就更是五光十色。要是你有空隨便到那家郵票公司去玩一趙，總是「琳瑯滿目」的。</p>
<p>我們中國的郵票比較單調的多，除了長的就是方的，而且差不多都是印的國父遺像。</p>
<p>功用</p>
<p>郵票還有一種最大的功用，就是紀念郵票。發行一種專門的郵票去紀念某人或某事，這無論在實際或者表面上都具有莫大的意義。像最近我們所看到的，慶祝蔣主席誕辰和慶祝國民大會開幕而出的兩套紀念郵票。紀念郵票在別的國家發行得還要多。美國羅斯福總統的紀念郵票有很多的國家都印發的。這不是又有了一種促進邦交的功能嗎？</p>
<p>意大利境內有個小國聖瑪瑞諾更有意思了：他們國家主要收入之一就是發行各種紀念郵票。在我們這次郵資漲價以前，據說郵政局賠蝕不堪。我不懂爲什麼不　兩套紀念郵票。難道說那樣是有失大國的風度嗎？發行紀念郵票所以成一項收入的原因，係由於集郵家的收購。</p>
<p>郵票是不守法的，越是遠法的越有價値，北伐以前張作霖自稱海陸大元帥的紀念郵票，戰前共產黨發的郵票，以及最近期間敵僞時代的「還都」，「防空」等等的郵票都是値錢的。</p>
<p>集郵</p>
<p>集郵的嗜好在世界上在中國，已經相當普遍了這不但是一種藝術，更是一種歷史地理的課程。你閉上眼睛想想看，一百年後的一個兒童拿着一套蔣主席六秩壽誕的紀念郵票，在他的腦海中不是就有了這樣一個偉大人物的印象嗎？不是比他書本的功效還大嗎？</p>
<h3>禁止吸烟</h3>
<p>— 蔡麟</p>
<p>電影院，劇塲，台邊墻上皆貼着「奉論禁止吸烟」的六個觸目大字。</p>
<p>這樣，恐怕還是無濟於事，因此在「說明書」上，再印上「奉論禁止吸烟」。</p>
<p>影戲開映之前，銀幕上又映出「奉諭禁止吸烟」的警吿。</p>
<p>這些、當伊　介事，吸烟自由，依然自得其樂的狂吸着。</p>
<p>電影院裏因窗戶緊閉，空氣不流通，是以燒烟之　，無法消散，且一陣濃烈的臭味，使不吸烟者會頭疼腦脹。</p>
<p>這批破壞「奉論禁止吸烟」的，全是知識份子，且一賣相」倒數好的，因爲其自恃「賣相好」而有此「勇氣」。</p>
<p>於是有不少敢怒而不敢言的視綫，不時集中到這位吸烟者的身上，暗示「猪玀！你難道不識字嗎……」</p>
<p>連這一點起碼的「公德」心都沒有，中國如何不要一　糟。低調</p>
<h3>六根未凈</h3>
<p>— 小僧</p>
<p>靜安寺爲海上名剎，也正因爲是「名剎」，繼德悟密迦被檢舉之後，又有「六根」請出了數十位護法施主，簽名勸進，回廟復員。佛門多事，實在令人有「六根未凈」之感！</p>
<h3>是否遺毒</h3>
<p>— 野草</p>
<p>節電運動已進入嚴重階段，各家都已接到了「違限即予斷電」的「哀的美敦」書；因此一片怨聲載道，大家都說：「這和敵僞統治時代有什麼兩樣？」「敵僞政治」竟被引爲與現實作比較的「天平」，不知這是否就是我們常說的「遺毒？」</p>
<h3>唏噓之聲</h3>
<p>— 隨</p>
<p>虞洽老靈柩發引之日，行列過處；有兩個「白相」型的壯漢在馬路邊唏噓不置。一個說：「他到上海的時候，和我們差不多，祇有四角小洋」，另一個則指指儀仗亭說「人家靠這兩個字混出來的啊！」亭子裏面是「勤成」兩個字，這一幕情景足可寫成一部小說。</p>
<h3>待遇問題？</h3>
<p>— 野草</p>
<p>江灣警士施恭慰因爲私受了烟民五萬元的賄賂而被拘罰。禁政推行已經數月了，毒氛似未稍戢，究其原因，不過如此，凡百政令，不能全其終始，我們均可作如是觀。聽說警員待遇調整，已奉當局批准，我們希望其不致成爲傳聞。</p>

<h3>民社黨領袖　張君勵</h3>
<p>— 彌山</p>
<p>在目前，張君勱顯然是一個各方矚目的新聞人物。</p>
<p>幾日前，對於張氏領導下的民王社會黨，究竟參加不參加國大問題，殆成爲一般人討論臆測的焦點。然而，「謎」終於揭曉了，民社黨畢竟提名參加國大。這一下子，常然使延安方面感到掃興。</p>
<p>張氏名嘉森，君勱其字，是現任鐵道部長張嘉璈先生的令兄。今年恐巳是六十歲了吧，籍江蘇寳山縣，一九〇九年在日本早稻田大學政治科畢業，做過前淸翰林院編修。革命時任天津京津時報總編輯，民國成立以後任工商部秘書。其後又赴學英德專攻政治。歸國後任外交部浙江交涉員，後來又卸職來申，任時事新報總經理。再後來，就專心在教育界上努力本位，當過國立政治大學校長，及東吳。光華及燕京各大學敎授。</p>
<p>張先生對學術界上的貢獻甚大，最不會令人忘記的，是早年在「女學與科學」的論戰上，曾經大大的出過風頭。他的著作，較有名的有「新德國社會民主政象記」，「Draft　forthe　Chinese　Constitution」等書籍。</p>
<p>張先生的辦黨，是在民國二十年，發起籌備「國家社會黨」，在廿一年發表政綱，又布廿三年，廿五年召開過二次代表大會。張氏是該黨的總秘書，全權負責。他的主張是：一方面不贊成「國家至上」論，但又認爲國家有其存在的重要性；另一方面又深恐代表國家的政府，再重蹈西方資本主義國家的弊點，因主張發展社會主義，以期避免階級鬥爭·十多年來，張氏以黨魁姿態出現於中國政治舞台，在抗日戰綫上也盡了努力。</p>
<p>去年十一月間，張氏　美，在蒙德里爾城與海外民主憲政黨作初步洽商，結果因「吾倆情投意合，並徽得雙方家長同意」，遂宣吿結合，產生了現在的民主社會黨，其宗旨係「以民主方法，完成社曾主義」。</p>
<p>由報人而學者，由學者而政治家，這是張君勱的三個階段。</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Will Hold its Third Session to Begin Discussing the Draft Constitution, and the Rules of Procedure are Passed After Heated Debate</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] The third session of the National Assembly is scheduled to begin at 9:00 AM on the 28th to commence discussions on the Constitution. It is reported that Chairman Chiang will preside, and a representative will provide a report on the drafting process of the Republic of China Constitution Draft, as well as the key points of its articles. The report is currently being drafted and is said to include a detailed account from the beginning of the Constitution Draft Review Committee to the latest revisions.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] The second meeting of the National Assembly began at 9:20 AM on the 26th. Assembly Chairman Yu Youren entered the chairman's seat, and Secretary-General Hong reported that as of 9:00 AM, 1,611 representatives had registered, with 1,031 representatives present, which met the legal quorum. He then announced the opening of the meeting. The reporter read the minutes of the previous meeting, and Chairman Yu read two reports from the Presidium: First, in accordance with the provisions of the preparatory meeting of the General Assembly regarding the reservation of seats for units that did not participate in the election of the Presidium, the Democratic Socialist Party representatives nominated Representatives Li Daming and Xu Fulin to the General Assembly Presidium (applause). Second, a list of the Presidium's sub-groups (attached and already seen in this newspaper, with Li Daming and Xu Fulin listed in groups two and three respectively). He then announced: Continuing the plenary review meeting that was not completed on the 25th, Secretary-General Hong first reported the results of the Presidium's summarization of the opinions of the representatives on Chapter Four of the Draft Rules of Procedure the previous "evening, divided into articles and items. Then, the voting began, with the results as follows: Article 18: 695 votes to maintain the original proposal. Article 19: 869 votes to amend it to "The draft constitution (the phrase 'and the date of implementation of the constitution' is deleted) is proposed by the National Government." Article 20: 1011 votes to amend it to "All proposals concerning the draft constitution (the phrase 'and the date of implementation of the constitution') or amendments must include reasons and be co-signed by at least two (originally 'three') representatives and submitted to the Presidium." Article 20 was passed without objection, maintaining the original text. Article 21: 7 votes to amend it to "The draft constitution should be reviewed by groups (originally 'The review of the draft constitution shall be based on chapters and sections'). When necessary, relevant groups may jointly review it." Article 23: 1021 votes to amend it to "After each group has completed the review of the draft constitution, a report should be prepared and sent to the Presidium, which will be delivered to each representative by the Secretary-General before the meeting (these four words added)." It was already 11:00 AM when Chairman Yu announced a break. At 11:15 AM, voting continued. Article 24: 756 votes to amend it to "Those who propose amendments to the results of each group's review of the draft constitution should prepare specific articles and attach (originally 'detailed attachment') reasons, and must have the co-signature of at least three (originally 'five') representatives, which will be submitted to the Presidium and delivered to each representative by the Secretary-General before the second reading. (The group book 'Representatives of each group participating in the review of the draft constitution may not propose amendments to the results of the review of this group' is deleted)."

Articles 27 and 28 were both passed without objection, maintaining the original text.</p>
<p>The Organizational Rules of the Review Committee Were Amended and Passed in Full</p>
<p>Chapter Four was thus completely reviewed. Following this, the remaining chapters were proceeded with. Chapter Five, "Agenda"; Chapter Six, "Readings"; Chapter Seven, "Discussion," were all passed smoothly. Only the word "special permission" in Article 42 was uniformly amended to "permission." It was already 12:00 PM, so Chairman Yu announced an extension of the meeting by 30 minutes. Chapter Eight, "Voting," caused considerable discussion and heated debate. After discussion and voting, the most contentious Article 51 was maintained in its original text with 743 votes, and the chairman retained the power to "adopt roll call or declare passage without objection" at his discretion. Article 49 was amended by an absolute majority to Wang Shijie's amendment, which changed it to "When there are two or more opinions on the results of the discussion of the same issue, the differences between each opinion and the original proposal should be compared, and the more different one should be put to a vote in sequence (originally 'the one proposed last should be put to a vote')." Article 52: 873 votes to amend it to "When the chairman deems it necessary and there is a request from at least fifty representatives (the original text did not have the phrase 'and there is a request...'), a reconsideration vote may be held." After Chapter Eight was completed, the meeting returned to smooth progress. Chapter Nine, "Minutes"; Chapter Ten, "Discipline"; and Chapter Eleven, "Supplementary Provisions" were all passed smoothly. The review of the entire "Draft Rules of Procedure" was thus completed. The clock pointed to 12:30 PM, and Secretary-General Hong, on behalf of Chairman Yu, announced that the meeting would resume at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and then adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] The meeting resumed at 3:30 PM, still presided over by Yu. Hong Lanyou reported: "As of 2:00 PM this afternoon, 1,615 representatives had registered, with 1,011 representatives present. The morning session was a review committee, and this afternoon is a general assembly." After the formalities, the amended opinions on the rules of procedure from the plenary review committee on the 25th and 26th were read out. It was resolved that Chairman Yu Youren would solicit any further opinions from the General Assembly before putting it to a vote. As a result, with 850 votes in favor, the "National Assembly Rules of Procedure" were declared effective. Subsequently, the reporter read out the "Draft General Rules for the Organization of Various Review Committees of the National Assembly," and Secretary-General Hong explained two points: First, this draft is named General Rules and compiles the organizational regulations of various review committees to avoid individually drafting organizational laws; Second, the technical issues included in the third proposal have not been included. The secretariat has already prepared letters to each representative, allowing each representative to freely designate a group and reply to the secretariat. After compiling and preparing a list, it will be submitted to the presidium for presentation to the General Assembly. Then, Chairman Yu announced the start of discussions. Representatives actively submitted written and oral opinions. There were amendments to the participation of representatives, the appointment of conveners, and the establishment of the review committee's responsibilities and methods of deliberation. After stopping the discussion, Chairman Yu held the original draft in his right hand and the amendment in his left hand, and voted on each article one by one. Except for Article 3, which was amended with 797 votes to "The candidates for each group of the Proposal Review Committee shall be nominated by the Presidium from the list freely determined by each representative and submitted to the General Assembly for decision. Each attending representative shall participate in one or two groups as a principle." All other articles were passed according to the original draft. The entire agenda ended at 4:30 PM. Secretary-General Hong reported the end of the meeting. The Presidium gathered in the rest room for a meeting and adjourned at 4:35 PM.</p>

<p>(1) The resolution on Ding Weifen's resignation from the chairmanship was to send a letter of condolence and dissuasion;</p>

Four more representatives registered, including Chang Naide, Duan Shenxiu of the Youth Party, He Jigang of the regional representatives, and Hong Shaozhi of the Democratic Socialist Party, bringing the total number of representatives who have registered to 1,616.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party Talk About Not Splitting Internally</h3>
<p>There is Also No Change in the Relationship with the Democratic League</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] Yang Junmin, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, answered reporters' inquiries on the evening of the 26th as follows: (1) Li Daming, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, is currently in Honolulu but will soon leave the United States to return to China to participate in the National Assembly. (2) It is rumored that correspondence between Zhang Dongsun and Zhang Junmai involved internal party divisions, which is not true. Although Zhang Dongsun is not participating in the National Assembly, he is still united externally, and there is no division. (3) The Democratic Socialist Party's opinion on the reorganization of the government is "As stated in the previous letter to Chairman Chiang, we hope to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference as soon as possible." (4) The number of Democratic Socialist Party members in the reorganized National Government Committee will still follow the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, with two of the five seats occupied by the Democratic League. We do not currently wish to increase this number and will not be harsh in any aspect of our rights. (5) There is no special change in the relationship with the Democratic League, as Democratic Socialist Party members participate individually, so there is no impact. (6) A portion of the representatives from Beiping were originally scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 26th but were delayed due to weather conditions. However, they will definitely arrive within a few days.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun and Chen Lifu Host a Banquet for Representatives of the Youth Party</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 26th] Government representatives Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and Chen Lifu hosted a banquet for all the representatives of the Youth Party at the Lishi Society at noon on the 26th, with more than 90 people attending. Wu Tiecheng delivered a speech first, followed by a response from Zuo Shunsheng. The main points were: (1) Party unity and cooperation, (2) Efforts to promote democratic constitutionalism. In addition, the Youth Party office has established a press office to coordinate with reporters. Li Huang will come to Nanjing soon. Chen Qitian recently resigned as Deputy Secretary-General of the General Assembly but has reportedly been retained.</p>
<h3>If the Chinese Communists Convene the So-Called National Assembly, it Will Cause Serious Consequences and Division. The Government Will Not Tolerate it.</h3>
<p>[Logan, Special Correspondent for the United Press, Nanjing, 26th] A government spokesman stated today that if the Chinese Communists decide to convene the so-called People's Assembly of the Liberated Areas, and at the same time, the Communist army continues to attack Suinan and Yulin, the National Army will launch a punitive offensive against Yan'an.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] It has been learned from relevant sources that the Communist army has also decided to convene the People's Assembly of the Liberated Areas in Yan'an around the Double Tenth Day in response to the current convening of the National Assembly, and to formally establish a democratic coalition government. The Eighth Route Army and the Northeast Democratic Allied Army will be unified into the "People's National Army" to confront the National Government. At the same time, they will do their best to plunder and extract the property, resources, and materials of the people in the liberated areas to exchange for legal tender, gold and silver, and customs gold to hoard in the Communist areas, destroy the national economy, and expand the anti-American propaganda movement. A reporter specifically asked a military observer on the 26th about the possible consequences of this news. The answer was: Before returning to Yan'an, Chinese Communist representative Zhou Enlai publicly stated that Yan'an had no intention of convening the People's Representative Assembly of the Liberated Areas. If this is the case, then the door to negotiation has not been closed, and the National Army will have no need to attack Yan'an. However, if the Chinese Communists violate the interests of the entire people and arbitrarily convene a pseudo-National Assembly to form a separatist government and divide the country, then the people will never allow the government to sit idly by while the Chinese Communists commit treason. At that time, it may force the government army to attack Yan'an to crush its ancestral conspiracy. Another reason that may force the government army to attack Yan'an is that the Communist army in northern Shaanxi is currently continuing to attack Yulin. Yulin is the key to Suinan, and the National Army's forces there are weak. If it is captured by the Communist army, it will affect the safety of Suiyuan and Baotou. Moreover, the Communist army on the border of Shanxi and Shaanxi has captured Yonghe, Daning, and other nearby strongholds, clearly provoking the National Army. The possible consequences are unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Forty Captured Personnel in Changchun Have Been Released</h3>
<p>Chen Jiazhen and Others are Still Held in Jiamusi</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Marshall Left Beiping Today After Meeting with Three Representatives of the Military Mediation Department Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 26th] Special Envoy Marshall's residence stated that Marshall will leave Beiping on the 27th. As of the night of the 26th, it is still unclear where he will go.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 26th] Confirmed News! Marshall met with Ye Jianying on the 26th, but the content of the conversation is unknown. In the morning of the 26th, US Marine Corps Commander Howard inspected the troops at the East Military Airport. Marshall was invited to attend the ceremony at 9:15 AM. Half an hour later, he returned to the Chairman's residence. At 9:50 AM, Marshall went out again to the Military Mediation Department to discuss with Jilin. At around 11:00 AM, Ye Jianying went to the Executive Department and participated in the meeting, which lasted for an hour and a half. After the meeting, Marshall went to Sun Lianzhong's banquet, accompanied by Chen Jicheng, Jilin and his wife, and Cai Wenzhi. During the banquet, there was a lot of drinking and the guests and hosts were happy. At 2:10 PM, the banquet ended. Marshall, accompanied by Jilin and Cai Wenzhi, left for the Military Mediation Department and first spoke with Cai Wenzhi in the Chief of Staff's office for 15 minutes. At 2:35 PM, Marshall went upstairs and spoke with Jilin alone for one hour and five minutes. At 3:40 PM, Marshall returned to the Chairman's residence to rest. At 7:30 PM in the evening, Marshall hosted a banquet at the residence for General Jilin and his wife, Air Force Colonel Fan Jiusheng, and a company commander. Overall, Marshall did not engage in any socializing other than attending Sun Lianzhong's banquet, nor did he visit the Western Hills. However, he had the closest contact with Jilin and met with the responsible persons from the government and the Communist Party of the Military Mediation Department. It can be seen that Marshall's mission to the north must be related to the US military stationed in China and the Military Mediation Department. In addition to actively visiting, Marshall did not receive any guests today, not even the highest local authorities.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 26th] Ye Jianying told reporters that he visited Marshall in a personal capacity on the morning of the 26th, but he firmly refused to answer any questions from reporters. In the afternoon, Ye met with Jilin.</p>
<h3>The Second Meeting of the National Assembly</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Pu Dejie</p>
<p>—Rules of Procedure Become the Center of Controversy</p>
<p>After the second meeting of the National Assembly adjourned at noon on the 26th, the unanimous criticism was that it was too chaotic. All that could be heard on the stage was someone repeatedly saying, "First vote to maintain the original proposal," while the audience shouted "Point of order," with everyone talking at once, upside down, and a chaotic clamor with no brilliant performance. One representative said with emotion: "No one paid attention to democracy. They neither respected it nor used it well. Fortunately, it was a review committee."</p>
<p>As soon as the meeting began, and the reporter had just read the minutes of the last meeting, a representative stood up abruptly, "Mr. Chairman! Are we holding a general assembly or a review committee?" Secretary-General Hong slowly replied, "The Chairman will explain later."</p>
<p>After Hong reported in an organized manner the results of the Presidium's summarization of the opinions on Chapter Four of the Draft Rules of Procedure the night before, he said cautiously, "Regarding this summary, the Secretariat was ordered to do some work in terms of technique. We were very careful and dared not be casual. If there is anything incorrect, please bring it up." The audience applauded in unison.</p>
<p>When the voting began, Ni Bi, a representative of the Soviet professional representatives on the first floor, shouted "Point of order," saying that this was a review committee and that if something had not been finished, it should be said again. During the debate in the meeting and when the final chapters were smoothly passed without objection, he repeatedly shouted "Point of order," in stark contrast to Zhang Zhijiang, a representative of the Ji District, who was always shouting "Maintain the original proposal" in the last row of the first half of the first floor.</p>
<p>Zhu Jingnong and Chen Changheng, one on the right and one on the left, each held a microphone in the hall waiting to speak. When an opportunity came, the two spoke together, singing a duet. Zhu had no choice but to return to his seat.</p>
<p>Whether it was a tactic or a habit, Chairman Yu always voted on "Maintain the original proposal" first, which initially caused opposition. "The opposing opinions should be voted on first!" "Vote on the amendment first!" "Point of order" "Hiss hiss!" For a while, the atmosphere was chaotic, the order was chaotic, the audience was dissatisfied, and the stage was at a loss. Lixuan representative Chiang Kai-shek stood up three times in anger and said loudly, "Please maintain the dignity of the representatives, especially to invite them to maintain order. This situation should not be in the National Assembly." The order was only a little better. It is said that he was already angry about the order yesterday.</p>
<p>Chairman Yu said in Shaanxi dialect: "All those who agree with the original text of Weite, press your respective 'doorbells'", and also made a gesture. Secretary-General Hong said during a certain vote: "There are many empty seats in the hall. Please each representative do not press the buttons on the empty seats by mistake." Someone in the press seats whispered.</p>
<p>During the discussion of the 26th amendment, a representative said: "A motion is not a proposal and does not need co-signature. This is enough and should be amended." Secretary-General Hong asked the meeting at Yu Yan's seat: "How about a vote?" "Good," the lights on the voting machine were bright, and the audience cheered. Although Hong could not see it on the stage, he also said when he heard the shot, "Most people have gotten used to it."</p>
<p>There was considerable debate about the number of supporting votes required for a temporary motion. One representative advocated "five or more," while another representative said: "Five or more is too easy, and too many temporary motions will hinder the overall situation." Secretary-General Hong then said: "I wanted to say this, but it is not good to propose it because of my position. Please pay attention to the fact that the venue is too large and there are too many people." Mai Huanxin, who was 28 years old, said upstairs: "All of our Xinjiang representatives oppose the requirement for too many supporting votes because we only have 18 representatives in total." Secretary-General Hong hurriedly explained: "The intention of this number of regulations is definitely not to restrict any part or unit of representatives." As a result, a compromise opinion of "ten or more people" was passed.</p>
<p>There was quite a debate about whether or not a temporary motion should be in written form. One representative said: "Without a written document, there is no basis. How can it be?" A representative said, "The establishment of a proposal is the basis." The one who said "Uh! Uh—" had not finished speaking, and someone upstairs suddenly shouted, "I have the best idea." After the entire audience listened quietly, they felt that it was not necessarily good, and after the vote, it was still necessary to have a written document.</p>
<p>When Chapter Four was in progress, Yu Youren's face was flushed, and he was conscientious. After Chapter Four passed, he felt greatly relieved and stood up excitedly to read the following articles, reading one chapter and asking, "Any objections?" The answer was "No objections." "If there are no objections, it is passed."</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang sat in seat number one when the meeting started in the morning. After the break, he left the meeting. He still attended in the afternoon. Apart from speaking to remind the audience when the order was chaotic, he did not say a word. Mrs. Chiang did not attend all day.</p>
<p>When discussing the organizational rules of the review committee in the afternoon, Chen Guyuan and Dai Xiujun proposed adding a second item to Article 7 to print and distribute the meeting minutes of each review committee to all representatives for reference. Shi Shangkuan proposed adding an article between Article 10 and Article 11 to revise the voting method and the conditions for the establishment of resolutions of the review committee, but none of them were approved by the General Assembly. The three legal scholars ate together</p>
<p>When Chairman Yu read out a certain amendment, a representative suddenly spoke. Old Yu said, "Wait, it's not over yet." When the discussion was in progress, as soon as he heard that there was an opinion, Old Yu immediately took off his glasses and looked around, saying, "Good, good." Hong Lanyou and Lei Zhen were his left and right assistants. Hong paid close attention to the meeting, and Lei fully assisted him in planning.</p>
<p>A reporter ran into Gui Yongqing in the meeting hall: "Deputy Commander-in-Chief, when will your reception be?" Gui smiled and said: "Soon, soon. I will ask everyone to help me create a reporter list today."</p>
<p>The entire afternoon session was calm and peaceful, in stark contrast to the chaos of the morning. A colleague said, "Things will turn around when they reach their extreme," and everyone ended quickly and easily.</p>
<p>The 26th was a day of continuous rain, and the meeting was particularly slow. The representatives, staff, and reporters all hoped that the weather would be better, and people would be in a better mood before holding the meeting again.</p>

<h3>Sheng Shicai's Impeachment Case, His Crimes of Violating Laws and Discipline and Committing Evils in Xinjiang are Obvious, 36 Accomplices Also Sent to Court for Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The case of Sheng Shicai, the former Chairman of Xinjiang Province, for violating laws and discipline, being cruel and corrupt, after being impeached by Supervisory Committee members Yan Zhuang and Wang Xinling, has been investigated and established by Supervisory Committee members Wan Can, Deng Chungao, etc., and transferred for disciplinary action. The criminal part of the case, involving 36 of his accomplices, has also been sent to the court for arrest and trial. It is reported that the contents of the impeachment case are roughly as follows: Since Sheng took power in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], Xinjiang has been a de facto separate entity, and the various illegal and disciplinary violations and acts of cruelty and corruption are too numerous to count. Among his accomplices, the most notable are 36 people, ten of whom are bloodthirsty by nature, and newcomers turn pale at the mention of them, calling them the Ten Butchers, showing their ferocity. Sheng's main crimes include the following: (1) Abuse of more than 20 kinds of bizarre torture instruments to torture and kill the innocent, with verifiable cases reaching 80,000 people, and countless others secretly executed. (2) Prisons are all over Xinjiang, and there are 12 in Dihua alone. The abandoned coal kiln in Liudaogou in the area is where the innocent were tortured and killed in those years. (3) Almost all the property of the imprisoned was confiscated, and their families were exiled, and there are still people in the Ashan Ili area who cannot return. (4) When Sheng left Xinjiang, there were still more than 3,000 people in prison, and Sheng planned to kill them, but he was rescued and spared. (5) During Sheng's ten years in power, all the people's possessions were plundered. When Sheng left, the treasures were all taken away, which was witnessed by the citizens of Dihua. The theft and sale by his accomplices is even more difficult to count. The Xinjiang Provisional Senate made accusations against Sheng's various crimes in the 34th year of the Republic, and the facts are detailed in the "A Brief Account of Sheng Shicai's Calamities in Xinjiang" compiled by the people of Xinjiang. The Dihua District Court also submitted a list.</p>
<p>The reporter, considering the importance of this case, visited the Supervisory Committee members Yan Zhuang and Wang Xinling, who filed the impeachment, but they were away on official business. Therefore, he visited the investigator of the case, Supervisory Committee member Wan Can, who said that the two Supervisory Courts are responsible for maintaining integrity, and that the merits and demerits of the senior officials in the frontier areas should be handled based on national interests, government laws, and the voice of the people. At the same time, in order to maintain national rights and stabilize the people's hearts, special attention is also paid to this case. After reviewing everything (Wan referring to himself), he believed that he had to agree, so he agreed to the establishment of this case. Wan also talked about his feelings about Sheng's various crimes against the country, saying: Xinjiang Province has formed an inseparable part of the Chinese nation for more than 2,000 years, and the relationship is extremely natural. During the Tang Dynasty, it also assisted in resolving internal difficulties, and the local ethnic groups called the Tang the Tian Kehan. Sheng took advantage of the times and seized the area. His policy was fundamentally wrong, not only ignoring the world situation and national policy, but also completely disregarding the interests of the local people. As a result, the entire interests of the Republic of China were affected, and ethnic minorities also suffered losses. For the sake of the country and the people, this kind of crime cannot but be investigated.</p>

<h3>Xiang Zhizhuang, Acting Chief of Staff of the Puppet Military Commission, Was Executed by Shooting Yesterday at Yuhuatai Execution Ground in the Capital</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Xiang Zhizhuang, who had served as the Acting Chief of Staff of the Puppet Military Commission, the Director of the Puppet Northern Jiangsu Appeasement Office, the Governor of the Puppet Zhejiang Province, and a member of the Puppet National Government, was sentenced to death by the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense this morning. At 10:50 a.m., he was taken to the Yuhuatai execution ground and executed by shooting. Xiang was a native of Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 53 years old, and a former lieutenant general staff officer of the Military Commission. In January of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], he was sent to inspect the artillery in Zhejiang. In November, he sneaked into Shanghai and colluded with Wang Zhaoming, and took various puppet posts. After Japan's defeat, Xiang was arrested by the former Military Statistics Bureau, transferred to the Ministry of National Defense for interrogation, and the judgment approval document was delivered to the Military Law Department last night.</p>
<p>Not Moving a Muscle</p>
<p>Knew There Was This End</p>
<p>At 10:30 a.m. this morning, Xiang was taken out of prison, his hair disheveled, wearing a blue cloth gown, cloth shoes and white socks, quite calm. After being escorted to the court, the presiding judge Xu Zhennan asked his age, place of origin, and position, and then read the main text of the judgment, saying: "Xiang Zhizhuang, colluding with enemy countries, plotting to resist the state, sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and property confiscated except for a reasonable amount to provide for the necessary living expenses of his family." And said: This judgment has been approved by the chief of staff and transferred to the chairman, and will be executed today. After hearing the judgment, Xiang did not move a muscle, as if he had known there was this end.</p>
<p>Requesting Paper and Pen</p>
<p>Drafted Three Wills</p>
<p>The presiding judge asked again if he had anything to say. Xiang replied loudly, "No!" His tone was quite decisive, but he asked for paper and pen to draft three wills in cursive script for his second younger brother, Xiang Huimin. The contents were: (1) The body should be provided to the hospital for dissection and research, and there is no need to return it to the place of origin. (2) Do not hang mourning in the house. (3) Do not mourn, work hard, and live peacefully. After writing, he threw away the pen and followed the soldiers out the door.</p>
<p>Before the Execution</p>
<p>Actually Smiling</p>
<p>At the gate of the court, Xiang requested "no need to tie up," and the guards replied, "This is the procedure." Xiang smiled and let them tie him up. Later, he felt that the binding was too tight and asked for it to be lighter. The guard said with a smile: "It will be good when you get there." Xiang smiled, as if nothing had happened. He was tied up at 10:40, helped onto a truck with a machine gun already set up, and driven towards Yuhuatai at a speed of sixty kilometers per hour. At 10:50 a.m.</p>
<p>A Loud Bang</p>
<p>Applause Erupted</p>
<p>When he arrived at Yuhuatai, Xiang's expression was nervous. When he was pushed to an open space, he knelt straight down on the damp ground. The gun pointed at the back of his heart, and with a loud bang, Xiang fell to the ground. The onlookers in the surrounding garden applauded. This traitor was thus killed. The body lay on the dirty, wet ground, waiting for his family to come and collect it.</p>

<h3>The Road to China's Economic Recovery</h3>
<p>Since the signing of the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce, American businessmen in China have actively begun their business activities, which has not only caused misunderstandings among some people in our country but also caused British parliamentarians to express great anxiety, demanding that Parliament send a delegation to China to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of our political and economic situation. Judging from the provisions of the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce alone, it is indeed easy to cause misunderstandings. Some Chinese newspapers have even bluntly stated that this is a new unequal treaty. British parliamentarians also bluntly said: "Americans are now exerting pressure on China, attempting to shut British businessmen out of China." The clouds of suspicion and apprehension caused by this Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce seem to be growing thicker day by day, both domestically and abroad, and it is indeed necessary to dispel them. Ambassador Stuart Leighton spoke to the press in Shanghai the other day, clarifying the spirit of the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce, on the one hand, stating that China does not lose its tariff autonomy and its power to control shipping and foreign trade; on the other hand, he solemnly stated: "The United States does not want and has not obtained special rights in China." British parliamentarians, after hearing this, can also stop worrying that "the United States is making China shut British businessmen out of China."</p>
<p>The spirit of the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce is entirely based on the principle of equality and reciprocity. Indeed, the United States is a capitalist country that has reached the highest stage of industrial development, while China is an industrially backward agricultural country, especially after eight years of war, which has left the country scarred. No matter how eloquently we talk about the principle of equality and reciprocity in trade between China and the United States, in reality, China is neither able to be on an equal footing with the United States nor can it enjoy the "benefits" that the United States gives us. However, our country is currently in a period of national construction. Not only is everything backward, requiring us to catch up quickly, but also everything needs to be rebuilt, and the material needs are very urgent, especially the need for economic assistance and cooperation from friendly allied countries. The United States provided us with tremendous military assistance during the War of Resistance, and now during the period of national construction, the United States is still very willing to assist China in economic construction, in order to complete its great cause of national construction. Its motive is entirely for the peace and prosperity of the Far East, and at the same time for the peace and prosperity of the world, without harboring any selfish ambitions or attempting to obtain special rights in China to monopolize the entire Chinese market. Therefore, China does not doubt that the United States harbors any ambitions and resolutely signed the Treaty of Commerce with the United States, but in its heart, it still insists on two conditions, with no room for concession or compromise.</p>
<p>The first is that sovereignty must not be infringed. Although the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce grants most-favored-nation treatment to each other based on the principle of equality and reciprocity, our autonomy over tariffs, our control over navigation, and our right to restrict import and export trade cannot be infringed by other countries under any circumstances. Especially since our country's industry is backward, it is necessary to adopt appropriate protection policies. Recently, the Executive Yuan revised the measures for import and export trade, including the following three items: (1) increasing the rates for some imported goods; (2) restricting or even prohibiting unnecessary imported goods; (3) encouraging and facilitating much-needed imported goods such as machinery and transportation equipment. The United States has not expressed any objections to this, which proves that the so-called Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce is actually a new unequal treaty, which is completely a misinterpretation.</p>
<p>The second is that we do not want to favor one over the other. China's current foreign policy and its foreign trade policy, in a nutshell, are to work together with "nations that treat us equally" to jointly maintain world peace and promote human prosperity and happiness. Therefore, any friendly or allied country is treated equally, and there is absolutely no discrimination. China is willing to conclude a treaty of commerce with the United States based on the principle of equality and reciprocity, and it is also willing to use this as a basis for negotiation to conclude a treaty of commerce with other countries. The British trade delegation's visit to China has also been widely welcomed by the Chinese people, which is good proof. It is unreasonable for British parliamentarians to worry that China will willingly allow the United States to monopolize the market and exclude businessmen from other countries. This may be due to isolation. Once the British trade delegation returns home, it will be able to understand the actual situation in China, and the doubts caused by the signing of the Treaty of Commerce between China and the United States will be dispelled. At the same time, judging from the trade policy of the United States, it has consistently advocated international free trade and opposed any country monopolizing the market. As the saying goes, "Do not do to others what you do not want others to do to you." The United States has no intention of monopolizing the Chinese market. Therefore, Ambassador Stuart Leighton also said the other day: "The United States does not want and has not obtained special rights in China."</p>
<p>The above two points are the common principles for China to conclude new treaties of commerce with various countries. However, China's conclusion of new treaties of commerce with various countries is the first step for China to achieve equality in treaties. If we can use this as a starting point and strive for progress, it will not be difficult to catch up with other countries. However, if we are only satisfied with equality in words, it is definitely not true equality and can be called "false equality." Under the circumstances of false equality in our country, we will not only feel disappointed because the benefits are only verbal and not real, but we will also suffer losses everywhere. Therefore, we have to go a step further and seek the realization of true equality. At present, China's actual economic situation can be observed from two aspects. On the one hand, export trade is in a state of suffocation; on the other hand, foreign goods are flooding the market, making the entire economic structure on the verge of collapse. There are many factors that cause the former situation, among which the most important reasons are: first, the exchange rate cannot be balanced, and the value of the Chinese currency is too high, which makes it impossible for Chinese exports to gain a market abroad; second, the backwardness of Chinese agriculture, which makes it impossible to improve the quality of exports. Adjusting the exchange rate is not a simple problem, and one move is enough to affect the overall situation, which requires careful consideration. As for improving agriculture, it is an extremely complex problem that cannot be solved overnight. There are countless factors that cause the latter situation. The result of the flooding of the market with foreign goods is that the national industry, which is already congenitally deficient, will be completely destroyed.</p>
<p>But how to save China's economic crisis? Leaving aside the palliative measures, the only fundamental solution is to improve agricultural production. After the Sino-U.S. Agricultural Technology Cooperation inspected agriculture throughout the country, it issued a suggestion, proposing seven concrete measures: (1) Promote agricultural education, with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Education cooperating earnestly; (2) Provide low-interest agricultural loans to improve the transportation and marketing of agricultural products, improve the tenancy system, and implement the land law promulgated by the government; (3) Establish a national agricultural bank to coordinate the country's agricultural finance; (4) Establish an agricultural management bureau to handle animal and plant quarantine and grading and inspection of agricultural products; (5) The government should encourage the use of chemical fertilizers for agricultural materials, farmland water conservancy, and awards; (7) For the main agricultural products for export, exports should be encouraged. These seven measures are practical and easy to implement, and our government should indeed study them. Baker, an American professor at Jinling University, has been in China for many years and knows the actual situation of our country's agriculture well. He recently stated that he also hopes that our government can adopt them.</p>
<p>In short, we cannot find fault with the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce itself; but as an industrially backward agricultural country, how can our country be on a truly equal footing with a capitalist country that has reached the peak of industrial development, so as to enjoy its "benefits" without suffering losses? This requires our "self-reliance." The relationship between "countries" is no different from the relationship between "people." "A gentleman strives for self-improvement," and the country must also "strive for self-improvement," especially China, which is backward in every way, and especially needs to be self-reliant, work harder, overcome economic difficulties, and reach the stage of industrial development, so as to move from the stage of "false equality" to the stage of true equality.</p>

<h3>Bandit Leader Xue Yonghui, a Traitor Who Once Served in a Puppet Position, Now Leads Troops to Harass Taihu Lake; The Jiangsu High Procuratorate Indicts Him and Fellow Traitor Cai Haogong</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou] The Jiangsu High Procuratorate has recently issued an order to arrest Cai Haogong and Xue Yonghui. The original indictment states that Haogong, also known as Cai Sanle, served as the commander of the puppet Taihu Independent National Salvation Army in 1942, and was later appointed as the captain of the puppet Cleansing the Countryside Inspection Team, and the chief of the Investigation and Operations Section of the puppet Special Operations Nantong Station. In 1945, he was reassigned as the chief of the Taihu Branch of the puppet Military Affairs Commission's Water Transport Bureau. After the victory, he briefly served in the Changshu County anti-infiltration work, but was soon eliminated. Xue Yonghui served as the deputy commander of the puppet Taihu Independent National Salvation Army. Both of them ran rampant on Taihu Lake and committed all kinds of evil deeds. Recently, police were ordered to investigate and arrest them, but because the defendants' whereabouts were unknown, they could not be arrested, which proves their guilt and fear of punishment, and they should be publicly prosecuted according to law. It is reported that Cai and Xue are now leading troops to harass the Guangfu-Zhenrenqiao area, calling themselves the "New Fourth Army," and committing all kinds of evil deeds.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou] The Yangcheng District Suppression Headquarters interrogated recidivist bandit Li Gancai at 9:30 a.m. on the 24th. Li bandit had gathered a crowd in the alleys of Kunshan to rob rice boats. After the 4th Battalion of the parachute regiment stationed in Kunshan pursued and suppressed him, the bandit dared to open fire to resist arrest. After being captured, the military court of the Yangcheng District Suppression Headquarters confirmed the facts. Commander Ma approved the Wuxi Command's decision to execute him on the spot. When he was brought forward for sentencing, Li bandit was dying due to injuries sustained while resisting arrest. Four paratroopers wrapped the criminal in a cotton quilt and brought him before the court. The criminal knew that death was imminent and was trembling uncontrollably. The Chief of the Military Court, Director Song, personally questioned him about his name and age, confirmed his identity, pinned the sentence notice to the criminal's chest, and then several paratroopers carried him onto a jeep. Military Judge Li Binjiang served as the execution supervisor and rode in the jeep to the Wangshudun execution ground. A paratrooper carried out the execution, firing five shots to end his life. More than a thousand onlookers applauded and cheered. Afterwards, the unit specifically posted notices inside and outside the city, detailing the crimes, so that everyone would know.</p>
<h3>Qingdao City Council's Suggestion to Sell Enemy and Puppet Assets to Compensate People's Losses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao] The Qingdao City Council believes that the losses suffered by the people since the War of Resistance are enormous. After the restoration, anti-war loss investigation committees were established in various places by order, and all people's losses have mostly been reported in accordance with the instructions. However, it has been a long time, and there is still no progress. The general public is deeply disappointed. If this loss is specifically waiting for reparations from the enemy, it is feared that it will be a distant prospect. It seems that the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet assets should be used to compensate the people's anti-war losses as soon as possible, so that rural areas and industrial and commercial enterprises can be restored. This has been resolved by the first general meeting of the council, requesting the Executive Yuan to issue a general order to receiving agencies in various places to use the proceeds from the sale of enemy assets to compensate the people's losses as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Street Vendors Oppose Centralized Operations; Designated Locations Are All Too Remote</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou] In order to rectify the city's appearance, the Suzhou authorities strictly ordered the police bureau to order its subordinates to ban street vendors. However, in order to take into account the livelihood of these people, they specifically designated the sidewalk behind the Beiju National Goods Company and two locations inside the No. 1 Tianmen New Market as centralized operating locations for street vendors. Although some street vendors have been ordered to go there, both of the above-mentioned locations are located in remote areas with few pedestrians, and their livelihoods are bleak, and their lives are on the verge of despair. At 2:00 p.m. on the 24th, the Suzhou street vendor representatives specifically asked the authorities for permission to hold a meeting at the Leiyi of Xuanmiao Temple. More than 300 street vendors attended. Zhou, a street vendor from Guanqian Street, was temporarily elected as chairman. As a result of the collective deliberations, everyone agreed that since the victory a year ago, national goods and industry have been affected by the dumping of foreign goods, and business is unsustainable. Many employees have been laid off, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. Therefore, it is as difficult as ascending to heaven to find a place to eat. Life is difficult, and they have no choice but to pawn their belongings and gather meager funds to set up stalls in order to earn a small profit and avoid freezing and starvation. The suffering in this situation is not something that those who have not experienced it can understand. Now, the authorities are rectifying the city's appearance and ordering street vendors to operate in designated locations. They should have obeyed the order and went there, but the designated locations are remote and sparsely populated, and there are few customers. How can their income maintain their livelihoods? Therefore, it was decided on the spot to jointly petition the authorities to show compassion for the hardships of the street vendors and to allow them to continue to set up stalls in their original locations. However, in order to maintain order, they specifically formulated management measures themselves and submitted them for adoption at the same time.</p>

<p>[Our Cixi Correspondent] The quota for conscription in our county this year has been approved by the Group Management District Headquarters as 394 people, and all are required to be recruited and enter the camp before the end of this month. However, the processing of applications for exemption and postponement of service in various townships takes a lot of time. Therefore, to date, only one-tenth of the new soldiers have entered the camp. The military section of the county government, considering that the deadline is approaching and should not be delayed any further, dispatched personnel to various townships yesterday to supervise and expedite recruitment. In addition, the conscription this time is scheduled to collect all volunteer soldiers, each of whom will be issued a settlement allowance of one million yuan, which will be raised by the township offices from residents.</p>
<p>[Our Chuansha Correspondent] The conscription quota for our county this year is 120 people, which has been fully recruited.

<h3>The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRD) Establishes a Work-Study School in Taiyuan</h3>
<p>[Taiyuan News] The ERRD recently established a work-study school in Taiyuan to help out-of-school and unemployed children in the city. More than 200 work-study students have now been enrolled. After the children enter the school, the ERRD provides free board and lodging, and hires many teachers to teach classes on time every day. The curriculum is the same as that of general primary and secondary schools. Students study and engage in production at the same time. In their spare time after class, they spin wool socks and manufacture matches every day. The output is quite impressive. Currently, they can produce 40 dozen wool socks and 20,000 boxes of matches every day. Two-thirds of the income is given to the children's families, and one-third is used for school expenses. The school's equipment is being actively expanded in order to increase production income. In the future, after the ERRD is terminated, the school can still rely on its own income to be independent and self-sufficient.</p>

<h3>Zhencheng Road Thoroughly Constructed</h3>
<p>[Our Wujin Correspondent] The Zhencheng Highway (from Zhen through our county to Jiangyin) was frequently destroyed by the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, it was destroyed by bandits. Although the authorities have tried their best to repair it to maintain traffic, the road has been in disrepair for many years, the roadbed is virtual, and the bridges are fragile. Driving is unbearable. Once heavy vehicles drive on it, it is dangerous. The Jiangsu Highway Bureau recently plans to thoroughly construct it, and has first allocated a large number of materials to rebuild the bridges. Construction can start immediately and is expected to be completed within a month.</p>

<h3>Bengbu Salt Dispute, Salt Merchants Oppose Rotation System</h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Correspondent] The internal dispute over the collection of membership fees by the Bengbu Huaiyan Transport Merchants Association has yet to be resolved, and the salt distributors in the city have recently opposed the rotation system. Before the military uprising, the prices of salt catties sold by transport merchants were mostly inconsistent, so they competed to sell them for fear of falling behind. Later, in order to adapt to the requirements of the environment, the transport merchants association submitted an application to the competent salt affairs agency to create a system of selling in rotation, referred to as the rotation system. After the victory, the transport merchants returned one after another and resumed their old business. They still resumed the old system of rotation. It has now been sold to the sixth round, and the price range has been evaluated by the transport merchants association to be between 32,000 yuan and 113,000 yuan per dan. General distributors in Bengbu who operate salt for food have recently believed that the soaring salt prices are due to transport merchants manipulating salt prices and increasing the burden on the people. The rotation system is indeed a bad step. Therefore, they are very active in opposing the rotation system, but both sides are based on their own interests, and their subjective prejudices are too deep, so it is difficult to resolve them for a while.</p>

<h3>Results of French Local Senate Elections: Popular Republican Movement Takes the Lead, Communist Party Still Demands the Position of Prime Minister but Hopes Have Diminished</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 25th] The Popular Republican Movement has finally taken the lead in Sunday's elections. The Ministry of the Interior corrected the election results announced this morning this afternoon. The accurate final results are that 24,751 members of the Popular Republican Movement were elected, and a total of 24,544 members of the Communist Party and the quasi-Communist Republican Resistance Alliance were elected. This correction has a great psychological impact. The setbacks of the Popular Republican Movement in the last general election may be compensated in the Senate election on December 8. In Sunday's election, only 18 million voters voted out of 25 million voters, and about 27.6% abstained; while in the last general election, only 21.6% abstained. The superiority of the Popular Republican Movement can increase its opposition to the Communist Party's appointment as prime minister. The Communist Party has not yet given up this demand, but its hope of success has diminished. According to the new French constitution, the Senate has no power to veto the appointment of the prime minister. The successor is appointed by the president and approved by the House of Representatives. However, the results of Sunday's election can reduce the Communist Party's excuse to serve as prime minister. At the same time, the Popular Republican Movement can also expect to obtain greater concessions from the Communist Party in negotiating the organization of a coalition government.</p>
<h3>Before Forming a Cabinet with the Communist Party, the People's Party Will Propose Three Agreements</h3>
<p>Although many leaders of the Popular Republican Movement believe that it is impossible to refuse the Communist Party's participation in the professional government, they will insist that before agreeing to form a cabinet with the Communist Party at the same time, the two sides should reach an agreement on the following three points: (1) Agree on a political program, especially a plan for financial reform. It is still remembered that although the cabinet agreed on a wage and price freeze policy in June this year, the Communist Party still launched a movement to demand higher wages through the General Confederation of Labor. (2) All cabinet members should bear genuine collective responsibility. The Popular Republican Movement has not forgotten that the policies passed by the previous Communist cabinet members were used by the Communist newspapers to attack non-Communist cabinet members. Today, 35,000 union members in Paris demonstrated under the leadership of Labor Party personnel, criticizing the government's food policy. People from the Popular Republican Movement believe that this is because the government's parties have failed to fully bear collective responsibility. (3) Each department must not be controlled by the party. The Popular Republican Movement feels that the ministers of some departments in the past have the intention of occupying the department for a long time, so they remove those who have served for a long time and have rich experience from the important positions they occupy, and replace them with party members of the same party. Such phenomena must be eliminated in the future.</p>
<h3>The Bidault Cabinet Will End in Early January</h3>
<p>The Bidault cabinet will resign when the House of Representatives holds its first meeting next Thursday. Political figures predict that the House of Representatives will ask the current government to continue to serve until the president of the Republic is elected in January next year. Although the powers of the Senate are only advisory, the Senate members have the right to propose laws and may send bills back to the House of Representatives for reconsideration; after being sent back, they must be adopted by an absolute majority, and even if the Communist Party and the Socialist Party are united in the House of Representatives, they cannot reach the number of an absolute majority.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Regarding the results of the "elector" election in the French Senate, after the French official announcement, the Ministry of the Interior issued a statement correcting it. Briefly said: The Popular Republican Movement has a total of 24,751 electors elected in the 89 provinces of the French mainland (excluding Corsica), not 24,151. As for the number of "electors" elected by the Communist Party, it is still 24,271. Therefore, in terms of the mainland of France, the Popular Republican Party has a slight advantage over the Communist Party. A total of 2,699 "electors" were elected by the Independent Republican Party, not 3,299. In addition, according to the election results of French Algeria received here: the Socialist-Communist United faction has an advantage, with a total of 1,136 "electors" elected, which is approximately equivalent to three-fifths of the total. The Popular Republican Movement, the Radical Socialist Party, and the right-wing group are in second place. Local observers believe that the reason why the left-wing group won is because fewer of its members abstained than the steady faction and the right-wing people.</p>
<h3>The Final Results Are Yet to Be Revealed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 25th] The Communist Party and the Popular Republican Movement have formed a race in the election of senators. After the results of Corsica Island were revealed, the situation changed again. 244 members of the Communist Party were elected in the area, while only 4 members of the Popular Republican Movement were elected. The remaining Radical Party won 209 members, the Independent Republican Party won 106 members, and the de Gaulle League won 5 members. The partial results of the vote count in Algeria showed that the Popular Republican Movement. The Radical Party, the Free Republican Party, and the Independent Party won a total of 804 members, while the Communist Party and the Socialist Party won a total of 92 members. Therefore, the situation of the Communist Party and the Popular Republican Movement can be determined only after the total election results of the area are revealed.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 25th] The victory of the Communist Party in the French general election may encounter another difficulty in the four-power talks on the German peace that have been delayed for a long time. News has been circulating in Paris that the new French government is preparing to deal with the future of Germany, which is currently the biggest problem in the world. The issue should be in January or after January next year. However, the four-power foreign ministers' meeting reached an agreement in early autumn this year to start preliminary discussions here in the near future. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes will not forget this agreement, because he has always insisted that no progress can be made in the effort for world peace until the great powers have some understanding of the German problem.</p>
<h3>China's Proposal to Investigate Non-Self-Governing Territories Was Rejected</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 25th] China's proposal to investigate non-self-governing territories was rejected by the Economic and Political Committee of the United Nations today. This issue was originally raised by Romulo, the head of the Philippine delegation, who accused those who maintain colonies of being selfish and self-interested. The Chinese delegation then proposed authorizing the Trusteeship Committee to submit reports on areas that have not yet achieved self-government, which was rejected today by ten votes to nine. The United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and other countries all voted against it.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Foreign Troop Deployments: Three Powers Remain Divided, U.S. Emphasizes Disarmament as Paramount</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in New York, 26th] The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has been discussing the issue of troop deployments in various countries for four days now, but the divergence of opinions among the three major powers remains unresolved. Today, U.S. Senator Connally and British Representative Noel-Baker presented the views of the U.S. and U.K. to the committee. The U.S. stood by its original position, calling for U.N. member states to disclose the numbers of their domestic and foreign troops. The U.K. abandoned its original stance that the issue of troop deployments in various countries should be part of a comprehensive disarmament plan and endorsed the U.S. proposal, calling for the adoption of an inspection system to ensure that all member states accurately report their domestic and foreign troop numbers.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] An authoritative source stated today that the U.S. is prepared to strongly urge U.N. bodies to take immediate action on procedures for limiting world armaments, including international control of atomic energy. The U.S. delegation is eager to temporarily abandon the issue of countries reporting military strength and focus its efforts on disarmament matters. The U.S. delegation believes that disarmament is the most important issue currently facing the 54 members of the Political and Security Committee of the U.N., and therefore, the U.S. "understands" that it will oppose the British proposal, which is the Soviet demand for "on-site" investigation of military strength. It is understood that the U.S. feels that if the proposal to investigate military strength is passed, the major issue of limiting troops will be indefinitely delayed for discussion.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Representative Urges Reconciliation between South Africa and India</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 25th] The Political and Legal Joint Committee of the United Nations General Assembly met today to discuss India's accusation against South Africa regarding its treatment of Indian expatriates.

<h3>Greater Syria Plan Opposed by Saudi Arabia</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Syrian Capital, 26th] The "Al-Watan" newspaper quoted a Jerusalem correspondent as reporting that the announcement by the King of Transjordan of his intention to organize a "Greater Syria Kingdom" has caused painful feelings in Arab political circles.

<p>[United Press, Moscow, 26th] Soviet scientists have announced that Professor Kurchatov has discovered a new method of atomic fission, but the details of the experiment have not been disclosed. Kurchatov is known for his research on heavy atoms. According to Pravda, the Soviet Academy of Sciences has newly appointed five professors of theoretical and experimental physics, and Kurchatov is one of them. Others include Skobeltsyn, who has made many new discoveries about cosmic rays. The London News Chronicle also carried a dispatch from Istanbul stating that the Soviet Union is secretly building a "giant atomic energy plant" in the mountains near Sukhumi on the Black Sea coast, near Mount Elbrus, the highest peak in Europe, which is approximately 18,442 feet high. The area around the plant is protected by a large number of military police, and vehicles are not allowed to pass without prior permission. The materials and labor required for the plant have the highest priority. It is estimated that its scale is comparable to that of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Deploys Secret Wartime Telephone: Relays Messages Through Invisible Light Rays</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] It was announced here today that the U.S. Navy invented a secret telephone during the war that relays messages through invisible light rays. Details are still subject to security restrictions and are not announced, but according to official explanations, it uses infrared rays. This machine has a "line of sight" range, similar to television, and can avoid being intercepted like ultra-high frequency radio waves. It can be used for conversations on nearby ships or on shipboard. The application range of the infrared telephone is limited to the horizontal line, with a distance of about eight kilometers between warships and bridges. However, when transmitting messages on land, it is easy to transmit point by point where wires cannot be installed and radio telephones can be intercepted.</p>

<h3>U.S. Miners' Union President Disregards Law, Lewis Complies with Subpoena, Trial Scheduled to Begin Formally Today</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] John L. Lewis, leader of the United States' 400,000 coal miners, appeared in Washington Federal Court today in response to a subpoena. His lawyer, Hopekin, finally stated to the court that Lewis was prepared to appear for trial next Wednesday to answer the charges of contempt of court. The hearing lasted 35 minutes, and Lewis remained silent throughout. His lawyer pointed out that Lewis's defense was based on two main points: first, that the Phosphorus Workers Association had taken no action after receiving the government's order; and second, that the court's injunction exceeded its authority. Assistant Prosecutor Sonnet argued that Lewis and his union had acted in contempt of court and requested that the court hold a hearing on the contempt case at 3:00 PM on the 27th of this month. Judge Coggin sternly warned Lewis that the case was of great importance and hoped that the union would not take measures that would force Congress to further restrict the power of unions. Hopekin requested the court to postpone the trial, but the prosecutor opposed it, arguing that the coal mine strike was causing significant losses to the country and could not be delayed unless the workers first returned to work. Lewis shook his head in refusal, and Judge Coggin announced his decision to formally open the trial on Wednesday. Upon hearing this, Lewis smiled, bowed, and withdrew.</p>
<h3>Electricity Conservation Strictly Enforced in Eastern States</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] The behind-the-scenes developments of the coal mine strike are as follows: (1) The Solid Fuels Administration has ordered all schools, federal and state government departments to apply to Washington for anthracite coal supply. Public utilities, food factories, hospitals and other coal-using businesses are given priority, or can directly hire from retailers. (2) The Civilian Production Administration has ordered an immediate investigation into whether electricity conservation movements in 21 states are being followed. (3) American steel companies have announced that they will do their best to reduce work at various factories. (4) Civil Life Party Senator Robert has once again called on President Truman to resign and for the Republican Party to govern. (5) The authorities of Virginia sued Lewis, President of the Miners' Union, in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Pridi Lost in America</h3>
<p>[United Press, Pleasantville, California, 25th] Former Prime Minister of Siam, Pridi Banomyong, lost valuables worth $300,000 after leaving a hotel with his mistress on Saturday night. According to Colonel Khun Yalarat, military attaché of the Siamese Army and Air Force in Washington, D.C., Mr. Pridi admitted to negligence in the theft and did not lock the safe when he left, believing that theft would not occur in the United States. Mr. and Mrs. Pridi are traveling in a private capacity and stayed in Washington for four days after arriving before being officially received by the U.S. government.</p>
<h3>New York's Bustling Streets, Dimmed Night Lights</h3>

<h3>Japanese Special Diet Opens, One-Month Session to Discuss Fate of Imperial Household, Yoshida Cabinet's Future Uncertain</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The 91st Special Session of the Japanese Diet opened this morning. At 11:00 a.m., the Imperial Rescript was read, and the ceremony was as usual. The Emperor rode in a large red car, followed by white jeeps of the U.S. Military Police. Communist members who fundamentally oppose the existence of the Emperor attended the session. After the ceremony, members of the House of Representatives drafted a response to the Emperor's Rescript.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 26th] The 91st session of the Japanese Diet officially began this morning. The one-month session will discuss matters related to the Constitution and the fate of the Imperial Household.</p>
<p>[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 26th] The Japanese Provisional Diet opened today with a speech by Prime Minister Yoshida outlining his policy direction, followed by questions and speeches by Diet members. It is concerned how Yoshida's cabinet will safely pass through this meeting period. Judging from the current political situation in Japan, Yoshida's cabinet faces a difficult situation. (1) The Socialist Party will stand in a purely opposition position and resolutely attempt to dissolve the Diet. (2) The labor unrest of the Electric Power Industry Workers' Union under the Socialist Party system is also sufficient to threaten the cabinet. (3) Due to the expansion of the scope of the purge order, the Progressive and Liberal Parties of the government party will be greatly affected. Therefore, in order to avoid collapse, the Yoshida Cabinet must implement effective policies to stabilize workers' lives, prevent inflation, and revitalize the rural economy.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] Colored students who come to England to study find it extremely difficult to find accommodation. As a result, a group of Indian students have had to live in tents, suffering from discomfort. A movement has been launched in London to raise funds to build dormitories for foreign students. Miss Davian, the initiator, said that black students are not used to London, and landlords take advantage of the housing shortage to make a profit by refusing to accommodate these "little black legs".</p>

<h3>Indian Political Crisis Intensifies, Wavell has Requested Instructions from London</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 25th United Press] Political sources: Viceroy Wavell has urgently requested instructions from London on how to handle the Indian political crisis. The Viceroy's request was issued after Nehru sent him a formal written notice. The written notice requested the Viceroy to allow the members of the Muslim League in the provisional government to resign en masse if the League does not want to participate in the Constituent Assembly to be convened on December 9. The Viceroy has sent his correspondence with Nehru and Jinnah to London. He expects that the current crisis will become more serious this week, and future developments will depend on whether the Muslim League modifies its decision to withdraw recognition of the British government's long-term plan for Indian independence, or withdraw from the provisional government.</p>
<h3>Economic Competition Between China and Japan Begins, Our Business Community Should Pay Attention, Japanese Silk Will Monopolize the World Market with U.S. Support</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The Manchester Guardian published an article stating that Japan is now laying the foundation for becoming a major manufacturing and exporting country in Asia. At the end of August 1946, one year after the end of the war, Japan's foreign trade surplus had reached 51,792,000 yen (equivalent to £857,000). Within the year, Japan exported raw silk, tin, lead, tea, semi-rubber, antimony, etc. worth £25,241,000, and imported raw cotton and food worth £24,384,000. Although the Allied Supreme Commander's Headquarters has stated that any member state of the United Nations can apply to trade with Japan, almost all of Japan's imports to date have been supplied by the United States, and 67.6% of Japan's exports have been purchased by the United States. Among all future plans, the textile plan is the most complete and important. Once this plan is realized, people in Asian countries will again wear clothes made in Japan, which is not far away. Japan is now engaged in exporting raw silk and silk products, and will soon export cotton yarn and cloth to Asian countries. According to official estimates, Japan will restore its pre-war position in the Far East market within three years at most. By 1951, Japan will almost monopolize the world silk market. 50% of Japan's raw cotton used to be imported from India, but now it comes from the United States, and it is now planned to import 890,000 bales from the United States. Due to labor shortages, production by the end of this year will be lower than expected, but by 1947, Japan will have a surplus of yarn and cloth for export to Burma, Malaya, East Indies, and India. Japan will be able to obtain foreign loans for importing food and paying for occupation fees. Officials of the Allied Headquarters believe that their plans will be promoted unhindered despite opposition, and that China's suggestion to ban Japan from military foreign trade within ten years is ridiculous. They expressed doubt that China could take Japan's place in the textile industry within ten years, and said that in any case, the people of Asia cannot wait long for cheap imports. British, American, and Indian textile merchants may raise stronger reactions, but because they are currently preoccupied with other matters, this reaction will not take effect within two or three years. The Manchester Guardian reads that the plan for the Japanese silk industry is even more ambitious than that of the cotton textile industry. The world's future demand for silk will be 30 million pounds per year, but the Allied Headquarters plans to have Japan produce 35 million pounds in 1951, effectively monopolizing the world market. In 1940, Japan's silk production was close to 95 million pounds, about half of which was exported. At the end of the war, Japan could only produce about 13.5 million pounds per year. Production is gradually increasing, but due to the lack of dry cocoons, production this winter may decrease, but will increase after the cocoon harvest in the early next year. Although officials expressed great sympathy for the Chinese silk industry, they politely declined China's request. The authorities privately admitted that they do not plan to assist China with machinery or any other items, except for allocating dry cocoons, silkworm eggs, or mulberry seedlings. They believe that China is currently unable to use dry cocoons economically. The Chinese government only hopes to prevent Japan from processing dry cocoons into raw silk and selling them abroad. The Guardian concludes that the economic competition between China and Japan seems to have begun again, but Japan will still be in the lead.</p>
<p>Japanese Businessmen Optimistic About Economic Future</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 26th] Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Hoshijima told many Japanese financiers yesterday that Japan's economic situation is optimistic. Coal production in the second half of the year can reach 30 million tons, and the spinning industry is proceeding according to plan, with sufficient cotton supply for each textile factory. Banks have been removed from the reparations list, so they can operate soon. Although the reparations issue is still there, the work of the economic sector has been completed, and the whole country will be united again when the peace conference is held in the future.</p>

<h3>Diligent and People-Oriented: The Mayor's Inspection Tour - Spot Check on Household Registration - Visiting and Comforting Brothels Without Fear - Deeply Moved by the Wide Gap Between Rich and Poor Citizens</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday morning, a light rain drizzled, and the weather was dreary.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the Guizhou Road Old Zhabei Branch, Second District Public Office, was more lively than usual, with all the staff excited and enthusiastic. The sole catalyst was the news of the mayor's upcoming on-site investigation. They weren't trying to "curry favor with the superiors," but after a long period of hard work, who wouldn't feel a bit of joy at the prospect of being favored by their superiors?</p>
<p>In the district head's office, Deputy District Heads Li Ruchun and Wang Chengxiong waited expectantly. For a month, they had been hoping for Mayor Wu's visit. Time passed by minute by minute, cigarettes were extinguished and relit, but Mayor Wu had not yet arrived. The mayor was originally scheduled to inspect the Second District first at 8:30 a.m., then the Eleventh District. Moreover, he was usually punctual, so today's exception inevitably raised concerns. Fortunately, this uncertainty was dispelled by the sound of a car horn. Mayor Wu stepped out of the car with a smile and said, "I went to the Xincheng District for inspection first."</p>
<p>Then, Mayor Wu said, "District Head, please accompany me to the most densely populated and decorated areas. I want to conduct a spot check on household registrations!"</p>
<p>An Elderly Man Bows and Scrapes, Repeatedly Calling Him "Good Mayor"</p>
<p>"Tap, tap, tap!" Mayor Wu chose No. 4 Hongxing Lane, Beijing East Road, knocking on the back door and asking, "We're here to check household registrations. Is anyone home?" This was an old-fashioned lane house, two stories up and two stories down. It was dark inside, and the light didn't seem to be very good. A sign that said "Yongli Yarn Weaving Factory Office" hung at the front door, already peeling. There was no sign of office work inside, just a few workers in short shirts reading newspapers. There were also a few children who were just learning to talk, crawling on the ground. When they saw a large group of strangers approaching, they opened their small eyes wide and shouted, "Papa!..."</p>
<p>The head of the household, Zhou Xiangbing, had already gone out. Mayor Wu patiently explained the situation to an employee and said, "Don't look at the household registration card yet. Try to tell me the names of the family members, and I'll check if they're correct." So, the employee looked up at the sky, bent his fingers, and recited, "Eldest, second, third,..."</p>
<p>Just then, the tenant couple living upstairs heard the noise and rushed down. The gentleman was in his late forties, with graying temples. He held the household registration card in his hand and ran excitedly to the mayor, first presenting the household registration card with both hands, then introducing himself, "I am Huang Shitao, this is my wife." Then he bowed and scraped, finally shaking hands warmly, and saying in an excited tone, "Good Mayor! You are truly a mayor of the people!"</p>
<p>Bank Delays Reporting, Mayor Kindly Admonishes</p>
<p>Mayor Wu, because he had received information that the Bachuan Bank (corner of Yunnan Road and Guizhou Road) was deliberately delaying household registration reports, decided to personally inspect and persuade the Bachuan Bank. He said, "The reason I want to inspect the district offices is to urge the staff to serve diligently and to awaken the citizens' attention and cooperation in household registration reporting."</p>
<p>When the Bachuan Bank's employee reported to the manager's office, Mayor Wu naturally received a warmer reception than he would have in an ordinary home. General Manager Liu Xiwen served tea and water for a long time. Mayor Wu said repeatedly, "You don't have to be so polite. I'm here specifically to check household registrations. Please bring out the household registration card." After a while, an employee did as he was told, but what he brought out was a survey form, not a household registration card. It turned out that Bachuan Bank had not reported its household registration to this day. It is said that the district office had politely persuaded them three times, but each time they were refused.</p>
<p>However, Mayor Wu still politely said to the general manager, "Today, as a result of spot checks of household registrations in various districts, I found that the common people are very good, but large commercial firms are more difficult to promote. I heard that this place has not reported three times..." Before Mayor Wu finished speaking, General Manager Liu expressed his deep apologies and promised to comply immediately. Then there was a burst of laughter, and everyone was happy.</p>
<p>Difficulties at the Brothel, Unfamiliar with the Distinguished Guest</p>
<p>The Fifth Bao of the Second District has one particular feature—there are a lot of brothels. Because the population has a large turnover, although Bao Chief Hu Baorong tried his best, he still encountered unexpected difficulties in handling household registration work. So, Mayor Wu's last program today was to conduct a spot check of brothels.</p>
<p>No. 9 Fuyu Lane, Yunnan Middle Road, had a "book house" lantern hanging at the door as usual. It was a three-story, half-new, half-old residence. The interior was very spacious, housing a total of seven households, six of which were licensed prostitutes. Usually, these brothels were commonly known as "Changsan Tangzi," which were originally high-end places for prostitution. Because it was morning, the house was dark and messy. Directly facing the door was the living room, with relatively old and cluttered furnishings. The rooms on both sides were places to receive guests, with full sets of mahogany furniture, like the most luxurious bedrooms. At this time, those who stayed in the room were middle-aged women. They were each working, some ironing clothes, some turning silk batting, some cooking, some combing their hair...</p>
<p>Naturally, they didn't recognize the mayor, and they would never have thought that one day, the mayor would suddenly come. The head of the household, Zhao Huiying, opened her sleepy eyes, buttoning the buttons on her clothes, and walked out of the back room. She looked at this group of uninvited guests with surprised and frightened eyes. The mayor explained kindly, "We are here to check household registrations, but we will never make things difficult for you, and we will never punish you. You can just say it boldly, don't be alarmed."</p>
<p>She was nearly forty years old and was the head of the selected area, also known as the "old madam." She had six or seven girls under her, named: Sister Xia, Li Zhenzhen, Young Brother Yang, Shi Nuannuan... At this time, a girl of twenty-one, fashionably dressed, walked in through the door. Knowing that they were checking household registrations, she introduced herself as Li Eryuan, twenty-one years old, and in charge of the Hongzhu Book House here. Mayor Wu then asked her, "How many people are in your household? Tell me their names." The girl replied coyly, "You want me to say their names, I really can't say them, because we usually call them 'Auntie' and 'Uncle.'" It was a soft Suzhou dialect. Mayor Wu had no choice but to see that it was generally not too far off, and instructed them that in the future, if there were any population changes, they must fill out and report their household registrations at any time, and that was it.</p>
<p>Nine Households Living in a Pigeon Cage, Feeling Unequal</p>
<p>After spot-checking a few places, the time was nearing noon. The light rain continued to fall, and the road surface was still muddy. So bumpy, Mayor Wu said with emotion, "The destruction of the enemy and puppet regime is really hateful. Now that several main roads have been repaired, we will immediately start repairing the small roads."</p>
<p>Next, Mayor Wu said to reporters, "After a half-day of inspection, I feel very satisfied with the household registration work of the district office. On the other hand, the environmental sanitation is really too poor. For example, garbage and fruit peels are thrown all over the street. Naturally, this is also due to the dense population and the reality that hawkers cannot be banned as scheduled, so we can only gradually seek improvement."</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu expressed his deep emotion. Because he saw in Xincheng District that nine families lived in a pigeon cage-like small house, the crowding and filth were unimaginable. He said, "The Chinese are really too unequal. The rich are too rich, and the poor are too poor!"</p>
<h3>Cai Tingkai Returns to His Hometown After Retirement - Leaving Shanghai for Guangzhou Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Songhu Anti-Japanese War hero General Cai Tingkai recently came to Shanghai from Guangdong to meet with Chairman Jiang. He stayed briefly in Nanjing and was summoned several times by the Chairman. He recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing and is scheduled to fly from Shanghai back to Guangzhou with his wife, Ms. Luo Xio, tomorrow morning. General Cai told a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday: He has been in the military for 30 years and is now at the age of retirement. Before going to Nanjing, in addition to meeting with Chairman Jiang, he also went through retirement procedures. Now that he has retired and returned to his hometown, he deeply hopes that the country will be unified and peaceful so that the people can live and work in peace and contentment. China must unite, cooperate sincerely, and work hard if it wants to stand shoulder to shoulder with the great powers.</p>
<h3>Director of the Judicial Administration Department, Zhu Ming, Comes to Shanghai for Observation</h3>
<p>Xie Guansheng, Minister of Judicial Administration, recently sent Zhu Weiming, Director of the Prison Department of the Ministry, to inspect the prison facilities along the Nanjing-Shanghai line in order to understand the situation. Zhu arrived in Shanghai by car from Nanjing at 3:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>More Than 400 Businesses Willing - To Reduce or Exempt Two Types of Income Tax - The Direct Taxation Bureau Explains and Answers Point by Point</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday morning at around 9:00 a.m., more than 400 businesses on Nanjing Road sent representatives, including Liu Xiexun and five others, to the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau to petition for a reduction or exemption from the salary income tax and securities deposit income tax. The responsible persons of the bureau, Lou Guowei, Bangban Ge Yanshao, and Section Chief Yu Xianda, received them and explained in detail the significance of the tax levies.</p>
<p>It is reported that the reasons for the request to reduce or exempt the income tax on salaries and remuneration from the various businesses are as follows: (1) Since January of this year, some personnel from various businesses have left their jobs, and the businesses themselves have no way to withhold taxes on their behalf. (2) The new income tax rates announced by the Ministry of Finance on April 16 are quite high. Withholding the full amount will affect the lives and work morale of the employees. The replies from the Direct Taxation Bureau are as follows: (1) Those who have left their jobs may be exempted from withholding. (2) The income tax on salaries and remuneration for on-the-job employees from August will be paid in accordance with the new tax law from that day forward. As for the taxes before August, they will be withheld in installments. Detailed installment methods will be handled later.</p>
<p>Regarding the income tax on securities deposits, the reasons for the request for reduction or exemption from the various businesses are also two points: (1) At present, most businesses rely on high-interest loans to maintain themselves. If the income tax of the lenders is withheld, it will affect the source of loans for the businesses. (2) Some creditor and debtor relationships have already been settled and cannot be withheld. The reply from the Taxation Bureau is: (1) For debts that have not been settled, the interest payable will be calculated according to the deposit interest rate of the money industry and used as the standard for withholding tax, not according to the black market interest rate. However, this point is the method suggested by the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau and must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval before it can be implemented. (2) For debts that have been settled, the businesses will copy the names of the depositors and send them to the Taxation Bureau.</p>
<p>Finally, the Taxation Bureau advised the representatives of the various businesses, saying that the country is currently experiencing financial difficulties, and paying taxes is the glorious duty of citizens. They also asked the representatives to assist more in the promotion of tax policies, and promised that the difficulties of merchants and civilians would be taken into account at any time and reported to the higher authorities for approval. The representatives stated that they would immediately inform their counterparts and then withdrew.</p>

<h3>Profit Income Tax - May Collect 30 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The amount of profit income tax for this year may reach 30 billion yuan. More than 20,000 units have been investigated so far, with a tax amount of 20 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The stamp tax in this city has reached more than 3 billion yuan per month since the second half of the year.</p>
<h3>Inland River Steamer Industry Asks - For Exemption from Punishment for Ship Rental Income Tax</h3>
<p>The Direct Taxation Bureau of this city levies ship rental tax, which is not only large in amount but also urgently urged. The Jianghai Steamer Industry Association has already telegraphed the authorities to exempt the tax. The Inland River Steamer Industry Association of this city has also quickly telegraphed the relevant authorities, requesting exemption in order to give the shipping companies a respite.</p>
<h3>The Processing Bureau Investigates - Traitorous Shares in Various Enterprises</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to investigate the traitorous shares in various enterprises in this city, the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 24th, instructing all trade associations to prepare a complete roster of members (filling in the name, location, name of the person in charge, total capital, etc.) and submit it to the bureau within ten days for handling.</p>
<h3>General Registration of Party Members - Deadline at the End of Next Month</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Party Headquarters carried out the general registration of party members, party members in this city have been very enthusiastic in going to the designated locations to apply for registration. It is learned that the registration deadline has already expired. Some party members in this city believe that the registration time is too short and they cannot complete it. They have requested an extension. The registration time has been extended to the end of December. The 33rd Registration Office (Municipal Party Headquarters, No. 80 Aitang Road) is still open so that party members who have not yet registered can go there to complete the registration procedures, or use the communication method to obtain a registration form, fill it out, and send it back. In addition, this registration of party members is limited to those who reside in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Tea Industry Petition Group - Demands Government Purchase</h3>
<p>This year's export of new tea has almost stalled because the exchange rate has failed to keep pace with prices. Tea producers are unable to sell due to excessive losses, and some export brokers are taking the opportunity to suppress prices and profit. Representatives from various tea regions have gathered in Shanghai to organize a petition, requesting the government to follow the precedent of purchasing silkworms and carry out purchases. This matter concerns the country's economic lifeline and the livelihoods of millions of tea industry farmers and workers. If the decision is delayed any further, the entire tea industry will inevitably collapse, and export brokers will be allowed to cut prices and slaughter them, which is worrying.</p>
<h3>The Second General Meeting of the Municipal Council - Will Review the Municipal Government Budget - Meeting Date Has Been Decided for One Week</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The meeting date for the Second General Meeting of the Municipal Council is said to be only one week. The focus of discussion this time is to review and approve the Municipal Government Budget for the 36th year. The meeting was originally scheduled to be held in late December, but because some councilors will not be able to return in time during the National Congress, the date of the next meeting cannot be decided for a while. If the National Congress ends early, the meeting will be held before the end of next month, otherwise it will be postponed to January next year. The temporary meeting place has been selected as the auditorium of Zhengshi Middle School on Anhe Temple Road.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Municipal Council Calls - For the Transfer of Two Tax Revenues to the Local Level</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council of this city received a telegram from the Qingdao Municipal Council, urging a response to transferring all land business tax revenues to the local level in order to facilitate the construction of local municipal administration, and requesting the speedy resumption of work at enemy and puppet factories and the transfer of them to private operation in order to alleviate the people's difficulties and increase production. It is learned that the Municipal Council of this city plans to submit these two telegrams to the Second Joint Meeting for decision.</p>
<h3>This Year's Municipal Financial Tax Revenue</h3>
<p>Will Still Be Implemented According to the Decision of the Council</p>
<p>Since the new tax law was passed by the Legislative Yuan recently, it stipulates that the tax rates for house rent, entertainment tax, banquet tax, and business license tax should all be lower than the current collection amount. The reporter yesterday went to the Finance Bureau to inquire about how the tax revenue in this city should be handled in the future and whether the new tax law should be followed. According to the person in charge, the tax revenue methods and tax rates implemented in this city are all resolved by the Municipal Council and submitted for implementation. The Municipal Council is the people's representative body. It has been explained in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings that for local politics, the decisions of the local autonomous body should be the principle, and the orders of the central government are only for reference. Moreover, this new tax law has not yet been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, and there is no clear order to Shanghai, so all tax revenues this year should still be implemented according to the decision of the Municipal Council in order to comply with public opinion and meet local conditions. Furthermore, although the theory of the new tax law passed by the Legislative Yuan is good, it may not be completely in line with the actual situation in various places. For example, the house rent regulations of the Legislative Yuan stipulate that those who live in one room alone or with one or more people can be exempt from tax. In Shanghai, where there are many people and few houses, such a situation accounts for 90 percent. If it can be exempt from tax, then the collection of house rent tax will become a problem. Other taxes also differ greatly from the original regulations in this city. If they are all implemented, the income and expenditure of the Municipal Government will be greatly affected. Therefore, Director Gu has already gone to Nanjing to explain to the relevant authorities of the central government and ask them to reconsider so as to meet local conditions.</p>
<h3>Military Court Investigates and Tries Three War Criminals</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Military Court has been handling backlog cases very quickly in the past week. It is learned that the court interrogated three Japanese war criminals yesterday to conduct an investigation: (1) Toyota Yutaka, former chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Residents Association, (2) Mitani Shunichi, who was transferred from Wenzhou to Shanghai and impersonated a Chinese, (3) Ichiro Shimada. As for the details of the case, the court did not disclose them during the investigation.</p>
<h3>Fire Prevention Publicity Day 2 - Zhao Zukang Broadcasts Knowledge</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the fire prevention publicity week of the Municipal Police Bureau.

<h3>Powell of the China Weekly Review Talks About - Today's Hong Kong - Replaced the Old Shanghai Concessions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Before the war, the English-language China Weekly Review was edited by JB Powell, whose sharp writing style and unrelenting attacks on forgery and criticism were very popular with readers at home and abroad. When the Pacific War broke out, Powell refused to evacuate Shanghai in advance, and was detained by enemy troops in a concentration camp, where he suffered greatly. The toes of both feet were frozen and had to be amputated by a doctor. After the victory, Powell originally planned to come to Shanghai to meet his old friends whom he had not seen for many years, taking advantage of the convenience of testifying at the Tokyo International Military Tribunal. Unexpectedly, he fell ill with heart disease in Japan and hurriedly returned to the United States for treatment, and the trip to Shanghai was cancelled. The China Weekly Review is now continued by his son, JW Powell. After a year of hard work, it is said that the sales volume has exceeded that before the war. The China Biographical Dictionary (Who in China), which is published by the company every year, has also resumed editing work. It is said that the first post-war volume will be published in March next year.</p>
<p>WJ Powell recently traveled to Hong Kong and told reporters yesterday that the general situation in Hong Kong is better than that in Shanghai, and food and clothing prices are cheaper than in Shanghai. However, the housing shortage is also quite serious, and the practice of key money and deposits is also prevalent. At present, the largest number of people in Hong Kong are various "refugees" who have come from East and South China. They take Hong Kong as a haven for escape, either for political reasons or for other economic purposes. Therefore, today's Hong Kong has actually replaced the old Shanghai concessions. New banks and money shops can be seen on the streets every day, with piles of flower baskets at the door. However, after they open, they do not actually engage in formal operations, because their purpose is only to cover up the escape of domestic funds. Powell also said that his father, JB Powell, is currently recuperating in a hospital in Washington. He very much hopes to return to China next spring. His health has improved greatly compared to when he was in Japan.</p>

<h3>Indictment of the Grain Loan Case; Full Text Published Yesterday; Collusion Between Officials and Merchants; Triggered a Wild Surge in Staple Food Prices; Eight Defendants Have Strong Suspicions of Criminal Activity</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The grain loan embezzlement case first came to light in May of this year and was initially handled by the military law of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. However, because the case was significant, involving many officials and merchants, it attracted attention from all sides. As a result, whether the case should be tried by the judiciary or by military law was debated for months. On October 17th, the order was given to transfer the case to the local procuratorate for investigation in accordance with judicial procedures. Now, after more than a month of investigation by prosecutor Wu Qihua, the case has been completed. Among the ten defendants, Yang Xinian and Li Chongnian were found to have insufficient evidence of guilt and were given a non-prosecution decision. The other eight people, including Wang Daren, have been prosecuted according to law. The full text of the indictment is published below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Indictment, 35th Year, Qi Zi No. 7002. Defendant Wang Xunzhi, male, 47 years old, from Hangzhou, residing at No. 55 Siming Village, Fuxu Road, Deputy General Manager of Changjiang Company, Manager of Housheng Company. Zhuang Hanzhang, male, 52 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 365 Zhongzheng East Road, Business Director of Changjiang Company. Wu Rongsheng, male, 47 years old, from Pinghu, residing at No. 370 Ximen Road, Manager of Santai Grain Store. Wan Molin, male, 45 years old, from Pudong, residing at No. 2, Alley 230, Huageguo Road, Manager of Wanchang Rice Store, Chairman of the Bean and Rice Trade Association.

Ren Xingya, male, 33 years old, from Yixing, residing at No. 53 Duolun Road, Head of the Adjustment Section of the Shanghai Food Administration.</p>
<p>The above-named defendants are suspected of violating the Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Emergency Period, etc. (35th Year, Zhen Jia Zi No. 2443, 4716). The investigation has been completed and it is deemed that prosecution should be initiated. The criminal facts, evidence, and violated legal provisions are listed below:</p>
<p>In February of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Government convened a meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Provisional Council, and the heads of various agencies to discuss general issues. Those attending the meeting unanimously suggested that the government implement grain loans. Because Shanghai had been occupied for many years, the grain trade was controlled by the enemy. The original large-scale, reputable grain merchant organizations were destroyed. At the beginning of the restoration, the citizens' food supply relied entirely on small merchants and peddlers purchasing and transporting supplies from nearby areas. There was no storage. Later, prices, grain prices, wages, and freight rates rose successively. Merchants and peddlers had limited capital, making it difficult to turn over and purchase goods. The quantity was reduced, and there was a deep fear that the inventory was too low and it would be difficult to maintain the supply during the lean season. The Ministry of Food wanted to support grain merchants to strengthen their power and enable them to bear the responsibility of supplying the people's food. Therefore, it ordered the Shanghai Food Administration Commissioner's Office to consult with the China Farmers Bank (later changed to the China Bank to provide loans) to devise appropriate measures. By April 1st, various parties were urging for prompt action. Minister of Food Xu Kan came to Shanghai to hold a meeting and personally supervised Wang Daren, a specialist from the Shanghai Food Administration, and Li Chongnian, the Director of the Land Tax Department of the Ministry of Food, to discuss and draft the "Shanghai Grain Merchant Loan Measures." Wang Daren and Ren Xingya colluded with Wan Molin, Chairman of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association, to relax the qualifications of loan merchants and pre-select a list of loan merchants. On April 3rd, the list was submitted to the review. The Xiaozu Committee, Weijiang Company, Santai Rice Store, Wanchang Rice Store, Wanchang Xin Rice Store, and others were all approved smoothly. All the lists of loan merchants and the amount of loans were:</p>
<p>Changjiang Company Wang Xunzhi 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Santai Rice Store Wu Rongsheng 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Wanchang Rice Store Wan Molin 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Wanchang Xin Rice Store Yang Runhui 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Xinchang Rice Store Zhu Yongming 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Yongshuntai Rice Store Gu Yisheng 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Tongcheng Company Fu Changyu 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Xiedaheng Rice Store Feng Yongsheng 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Qianchangyu Rice Store Yu Liangji 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Hengtaifeng Rice Store Zhang [missing character] Chao 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Guangye Company Jin Zhifeng 60 million yuan</p>
<p>(Because procedures were not completed, the loan was not obtained)</p>
<p>Zhi Feng Rice Store Xu Taiyuan 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Xiechangtai Rice Store Zhu Shilu 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Hui Feng Company Wang Yuzhen 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Tong Yi Company Lu Linxun 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Jiangbei Company Xing Songwen 60 million yuan</p>
<p>Fu Kang Rice Store Shao Jigao 40 million yuan</p>
<h3>Food Officials Allow Grain Merchants to Hoard; Rice Prices Soar; Public Resentment Boils Over</h3>
<p>Except that Guangye Company did not obtain a loan due to incomplete procedures and the other thirteen Xinchang Rice Store, etc., there is no criminal evidence. Wang Xunzhi and Zhuang Hanzhang of Changjiang Company, Wu Rongsheng of Santai Rice Store, and Wan Molin of Wanchang Rice Store used this opportunity to hoard rice, monopolize the rice market, and manipulate the rice market. Xing Zhigang, the executive director of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, failed to apply for a loan and intended to expose the secrets of the grain loan. Wan Molin could not make amends, so he transferred the rice funds obtained by Wanchang Xin Rice Store to Xing Zhigang without the approval of the competent authorities after reaching an agreement with Yang Runyou. Wang Daren and Ren Xingya passively did not interfere, causing Shanghai rice prices to rise suddenly during the loan period. Within a few days, rice prices soared, exceeding 30,000 yuan, which caught the attention of both domestic and foreign parties, and public resentment boiled over. Cheng Zhonghang, the supervisor of the Jiangsu Supervisory District of the Control Yuan, ordered section chiefs and investigators to thoroughly investigate the truth from the Food Administration, the Bean and Rice Trade Association, and the companies and firms that received the grain loans. He believed that Yang Xizhi, the special commissioner of the Shanghai Food Administration, Wang Daren, a specialist of the Food Administration acting as the director, Ren Xingya, the head of the Adjustment Section, and Li Chongnian, the director of the Land Tax Department of the Ministry of Food, had all violated the law and were derelict in their duties. He submitted an impeachment to the Executive Yuan, involving criminal elements, and requested the hospital to investigate. According to the investigation department in June this year, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters also found that Wang Xunzhi of Changjiang Company and Zhuang Hanzhang, the business director of the company, and Wu Rongsheng of Thirty-Tai Rice Store were suspected of hoarding grain for profit. They were all arrested and transferred to the court with the file on October 17 of this year.</p>
<h3>Wang Xunzhi: Packaging and On-line, Deliberately Manipulating</h3>
<p>Defendant Wang Xunzhi is currently the Deputy General Manager of Changjiang Company and the Manager of Housheng Company. Because he served as the Deputy Director of the National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Director of the Zhejiang Monopoly Bureau, he had personal relationships with the current food administration staff. In addition to borrowing 150 million yuan in grain funds from Zhejiang in the name of Housheng Company, he also borrowed 60 million yuan in grain funds in the name of Changjiang Company at the beginning of the grain loan in this city. After receiving the loan on April 14th, he went to [missing character] Wuhu and other places to purchase and transport grain. On April 24th, his first shipment of grain from Fengjing, totaling 351 and a half dan, had arrived in Shanghai. Rice prices were rising. In order to hoard and speculate, the defendant delayed selling it on the market and stored the incoming grain. By May 14th, there was a total of 1,847 and a half stones of stored grain. Only 696 stones were sold after being urged to sell. His actions not only violated Article 13 of the Grain Loan Measures, but also showed speculative and manipulative behavior. He should be severely punished in accordance with Article 31 of the Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Emergency Period. Although the defendant repeatedly argued: On April 24th, 351 and a half stones of rice arrived. I filled out a form and reported to the Food Administration. I didn't receive a notice of approval to sell until the 26th. Unexpectedly, the market became chaotic on the 27th and the rice was not sold. The defense wants to know that the defendant has good relations with the current food administration staff, so he can borrow a large amount of grain funds in both Jiangsu and Zhejiang. How could it be that he was not allowed to sell immediately after the grain arrived on April 24th? Even stepping back, the defendant should have filled out a form and reported it on the same day when the grain arrived on April 24th, and he could have sold it on the market on the 25th. Why did he receive the approval notice on the 26th? It is clearly a fabricated excuse and not credible. Instead of selling it as soon as it arrived, he wanted to pack it, sew the bags, transport it to the warehouse, etc., in preparation for hoarding, which is highly suspected of deliberately manipulating rice prices. In addition to the competent authority confiscating his hoarded goods in accordance with Article 18 of the Emergency Regulations for the Supervision and Restriction of Daily Necessities [missing characters] Hoarding, the defendant's evidence of the crime is very clear, and he should be severely punished. Defendant Zhuang Han [missing character] is the business director of Changjiang Company. He must be responsible for the purchase and sale. Now he is hoarding together, placing the immediate sale approved by the Adjustment Section in disregard of the responsibility of helping to violate Article 31 of the Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Emergency Period.</p>
<h3>Wu Rongsheng of Santai Rice Store Sells Public Rice to Rice Dealers for Personal Gain</h3>
<p>On April 29th, Wu Rongsheng of Santai Rice Store, the Food Administration authority, thought there would be a storm because Yi [missing character] Company sold rice at a low price, causing a storm, The Administration requested to report to Chief Song of the Executive Yuan, decided to stop selling loan merchants' rice, and at the same time, ordered the Shanghai Food Administration to allocate 30,000 stones of rice under the military food item for restoring trading the market and food use in order to stabilise [missing character] rice, Wu Rongsheng of Santai Rice Store, Feng Yongsheng of Xie Daheng Rice Store to sell the International Rice Factory's white rice to the market on each of the firm’s names, from April 29th to May 9th, a total of 11,000 packages of rice were transferred to Santai Rice Store, This is an emergency measure. The defendant should be conscientious, law-abiding and sell public rice to rice dealers to achieve real sales and stabilize people’s confidence, but in contrast, Wu Rongsheng sold 1,193 packs totaling 1,407 stones to the peers, so although the rice was sold, it was actually still kept in the rice stores, which violated the market regulations. It is obvious that it is monopolizing and manipulating the rice market, The defendant’s actions have violated Article 31 of the Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce During the Emergency Period.</p>
<h3>Wan Molin - Part</h3>
<p>The defendant, Wan Molin, is the chairman of the Bean and Rice Trade Association. The rice shops he operates include Wan Chang, Wan Chang Xin, and a portion of San Tai Rice Shop. All three of these rice shops have been listed for grain loans without exception, indicating that from the beginning, he had the intention of seizing grain loan benefits based on his special position. Now, after the grain and rice arrived in Shanghai, there are records in his Wan Chang Rice Shop's sales diary of selling rice to Wan Chang Rice Shop. This is clearly a false sale, but in reality, he still controls it to achieve the purpose of hoarding and speculation. It is calculated that 50 shi were sold to Wan Chang Rice Shop on April 23, 225 shi on May 17, and 65 shi were allocated to Wan Chang on April 28, and 317 shi, 7 dou, 7 sheng, and 9 ge on May 15, totaling 657 shi, 7 dou, 7 sheng, and 9 ge. Furthermore, the defendant reported the total amount of grain received to the Grain Administration Office as 1,952 shi and 8 dou, which is 50 shi less than the quantity of goods purchased. The total amount of grain sold was 1,322 shi and 8 dou, which is a discrepancy of 630 shi compared to the previous total sales amount, which creates a strong suspicion of hoarding. He should also be punished appropriately in accordance with Article 31 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce during Extraordinary Periods.</p>
<h3>Xing Zhigang Obtains Loans by Impersonating Wan Chang Xin</h3>
<p>The defendant, Xing Zhigang, was eliminated by the Grain Loan Review Committee because he failed to deliver the required amount of military grain. Later, he colluded with Yang Run and Wan Molin to obtain loans by impersonating Wan Chang Xin, which is not the behavior of a legitimate businessman. It is verified that he is suspected of violating Article 339, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The defendant, Yang Run, is the manager of Wan Chang Xin, and Wan Molin is the owner of Wan Chang Xin. Without the approval of the competent authorities, they transferred the 60 million yuan in rice funds obtained by Wan Chang Xin to Xing Zhigang. They have confessed this fact during the investigation. Therefore, the defendant, with the intention to help others commit crimes, and his actions constituting the elements of a crime, should be recognized as joint principals in the aforementioned crime and should also be sentenced to appropriate penalties.</p>
<p>It is found that Yang Xizhi, a special commissioner of the Grain Administration Office, flew to the United States by plane on March 14 of this year. During his assignment to attend international conferences, the defendant, Wang Daren, a key official actually responsible for grain administration in Shanghai, colluded with Wan Molin, the chairman of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, to introduce Wang Xunzhi of the Yangtze River Company as a grain loan borrower. However, that company hoarded and monopolized the market. Wang Xunzhi, Wu Rongsheng, and the defendant are old friends. The defendant's position was the person in charge of grain administration in Shanghai, and he had a legal obligation to prevent such actions, and he was able to prevent them but did not do so, allowing merchants to hoard, causing food prices to soar. His passive behavior assisted Wang Xunzhi and others in committing crimes and is inexcusable. He should be held responsible for assisting others in violating Article 31 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce during Extraordinary Periods and should be punished in accordance with Article 15 and Articles 3 and 134 of the same law.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Soar; Ren Xingya Should Be Held Responsible</h3>
<p>The defendant, Ren Xingya, is the section chief of the Adjustment Section of the Grain Administration Office. Regulating the people's food supply and controlling rice and grain are his responsibilities. Now, during the period when grain loans were being offered, rice prices should have decreased due to the smooth supply of grain merchants, but instead, they rose sharply, which was obviously caused by unscrupulous merchants manipulating the market and traders hoarding goods. The hoarding and speculation of the Yangtze River Company and San Tai Rice Shop have been described above. The Adjustment Section, which is in charge, has a legal obligation to prevent such actions, but it was allowed to happen without intervention. Even if it cannot be proven that they colluded for profit and assisted others in monopolizing and manipulating the market, they should still be held responsible for assisting in violating Article 31 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce. Please impose punishment in accordance with Articles 15, 30, and 134 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>In summary, the above-mentioned defendants are suspected of committing serious crimes and should be punished according to the law. Except for the defendants Yang Xizhi and Li Chongnian, whose crimes are insufficient, and the loan merchant Zhu Yongming and others, who lack evidence of crimes, they should be dismissed separately. In accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is hereby initiated. Addressed to the Criminal Division of this court, Wu Qihua, Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court. November 23, Year 35 of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Swiss National, Weitler, Accused of Espionage; High Court Holds Preliminary Hearing Yesterday; Inquiry Regarding Codes; Claims They Were Used For Roulette; Insists They Were Purchased From Montreal; Extensively Discusses Gambling Experience In Court</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Swiss national Eily Widler, 58 years old, was recently accused by Eddie Lee of the Songhu Garrison Command of counterfeiting American currency and stamps, selling copper to the Japanese, obtaining a pass from the Japanese military, and working as a spy.

<h3>Investigation of Four Cases</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The High Court opened a hearing yesterday to investigate several cases of suspected traitors: (1)</p>
<p>Fan Cunzheng</p>
<p>Twenty-eight years old. He was picked up by the Shanghai County Provisional Council, who pointed out that he had served as a secret agent for the enemy's military police and as an instructor in the Puppet Beiqiao District Office. The defendant denied that he had served as an enemy secret agent, but admitted that he had served as an instructor in the puppet Baobaojia system, but claimed that he had joined the Martin Action Team under orders to cover underground workers. He was full of patriotic and anti-Japanese words. He also claimed that the reason he was reported this time was because he refused to accept a bribe from Section Chief Li of the County Government, which led to a conflict. Huang Yunshang, the Speaker of the Provisional Council, stated in court that someone had informed the Provisional Council, so he filed a report, which was the consensus of the Council. After the interrogation, the defendant cupped his hands to the informant and said, "Thank you, sir, for giving me a lesson by coming here." The informant nodded yes, yes. (2) Heng'an Shipyard Manager</p>
<p>Zheng Liangbin</p>
<p>He was accused of serving as a Foreign Affairs Committee member of the Puppet Central Political Committee and as a standing director and ship department director of the Chinese Shipping Company jointly operated by the enemy and puppets.

The above cases were all adjourned for further questioning about the industrial property in the camp. The court showed him a newspaper report that indicated he had colluded with the enemy. Wei read it and said that this was</p>
<p>Deliberate Slander</p>
<p>In the hope of obtaining property, because I live in a house that occupies 25 mu of land, which is wide and beautiful. The court then asked: "In the 26th and 27th years of the Republic of China, you won the first prize in horse racing and bought a yacht to travel. You encountered a hurricane outside the Wusongkou and it sank. Fortunately, you were rescued by the Japanese and went to live in Japan for more than half a year?" Wei replied: "Apart from winning the first prize, the rest is fictional." When asked about the theft of purple copper stored in Shanghai by the American Mosheng Company on behalf of the Central Mint, Wei replied: "This was sold to the Japanese by Mosheng Company, and there is a letter from Mosheng to prove it. It happened between the 29th and 30th years of the Republic. At that time, the total value was 4 million legal tender, and I received a commission of 200,000 yuan, but it was obtained from the American company. The 4 million yuan obtained from the sale was</p>
<p>Mosheng Company</p>
<p>Entrusted the Shanghai Youli Bank to remit the money to the New York headquarters. Later, I heard that Mosheng remitted the money to the Chinese government in the 30th year of the Republic, but the amount is unknown." The court immediately said, "The Central Mint has sent a letter to the Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Command, stating that it has not received the money." Wei replied, "This has nothing to do with me." Then, he was asked about obtaining a special pass from the enemy military and acting as a spy. Wei replied, "At that time, foreigners in the occupied areas could obtain this permit. Although I was allowed to take news photos, I never actually took any." The court then asked what the three codebooks were for. Wei said, "This is not a code, but the numbers for Western roulette. It was published by Monte Carlo City in Europe and purchased by mail for personal</p>
<p>Game Entertainment</p>
<p>I used it to study which number I could hit, but I have not yet completed this work." After speaking, he explained in detail how to use it for games and gambling. He also said: "To regard this as a code is to be ignorant." After the interrogation came to an end, Wei stated to the court that when he was arrested, two gold watches, two gold rings, one gold bar, 5,000 US dollars, and a car were taken away, and the office was sealed and occupied. The Garrison Command has destroyed my reputation. At first, I was accused of counterfeiting American currency, but after investigation, there was no evidence, and now I am accused of espionage," and requested that he be released. The court replied, "You need to submit a written application for bail, and the collegiate bench will evaluate and decide. You can be released very quickly." After speaking, he ordered a further hearing. After Wei spoke with his family, he was escorted back to prison by bailiffs.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Exerts Pressure; Gold Prices Slightly Decrease; An Additional 6,000 Taels Released Besides Allotments; Black Market for US Dollars Also Weakens Concurrently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold continued its upward trend, but after rising, it showed more flexibility. It opened at 2,692,000 in the morning, with strong market sentiment. Brokers and securities firms were actively acquiring, immediately pushing through the 2,700,000 mark. Buyers were very excited, repeatedly pushing prices higher. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allotted 500 taels at a price of 2,732,500. The high price rose to about 2,745,000. The Central Bank vigorously sold at the high price, and the upward trend was hindered and fell back. Floating long positions also eagerly sold. At noon, it retreated below 2,700,000. In the afternoon, market sentiment was even calmer. After the Central Bank vigorously sold 6,000 taels in the morning, buyers' interest decreased, and it continued to fall slightly. Compared with the previous close, there was no significant difference. Gold ornaments and silver bars were flat, silver dollars rose slightly, the black market interest was stable, and the interest rate remained between 1.2 and 1.5 corners.</p>
<p>According to those familiar with market conditions, there are two main reasons why it is not easy to curb the rise in gold prices: (1) The price of gold in other ports is higher than in this city, especially in Hong Kong. Therefore, the re-export of gold is inevitable. (2) Although the Central Bank is constantly selling, the cash positions of commercial banks are gradually loosening, and there is a lot of floating capital in the market, which is concentrated on the purchase of gold. The increase in gold prices, if calculated by black market interest, is more than 1%, which is the safest investment. Therefore, observing the future trend of gold prices, it may not be possible to restore the level before the upward trend began.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were passively boosted, and the black market for US dollars opened in the morning at 4,850 yuan to 4,900 yuan. It once rose to more than 4,950 yuan, but after the gold market fell back, it also retreated to about 4,850 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, buyers were more cautious, and asking prices were slightly lower. Compared with the previous close, it weakened slightly. The Hong Kong dollar was stable, with the exchange rate at 945 yuan to 955 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,140 yuan to 1,150 yuan. The British exchange rate was 15,150 yuan to 15,250 yuan. Transactions were not active. The official exchange rate for the US dollar did not change, but over-the-counter transactions were quiet.</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of Fertilizer Transported to Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the Haiqian ship sailed to Keelung, transporting 336 bolts of cloth, 105 bales of cotton yarn, more than 1,350 bags of beans, more than 12,000 pieces of soybean cake, 30 pieces of sulfuric acid, and more than 900 pieces of miscellaneous goods. In addition, there were more than 9,000 bags of Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration fertilizer, as well as more than 9,000 pieces of canned food. The Dengkeng ship sailed to Tianjin yesterday, carrying more than 2,600 pieces of paper, 120 bolts of cloth, and more than 1,430 bags of sugar.</p>
<h3>4.3 Million for Fine Yarn; 20-Count Yarn Rises by 230,000 and Is Still Firm</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market was exceptionally firm. Buyers from the inland areas who came to Shanghai to purchase yarn and thread felt that there was no way to buy it and turned to brokers to search for spot goods. It is heard that outside the market, 20-count yarn rose by another 230,000, and 42-count yarn was in high demand by weaving factories, and they raised prices to absorb it, once reaching as high as 4.3 million, a huge jump of 200,000.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth was selling well to buyers. Yesterday, Textile Construction sold as usual, but due to the limited supply, asking prices in the market were quite high. Serge fine cloth continued to rise by 12,000 yuan or more, and colored cloth Zhigong was stable.</p>
<h3>Spinning and Rubber: Relatively Profitable</h3>
<p>According to industry insiders, there are approximately 120 types of industries in the city. The conditions of most industries this year have been affected by high interest rates and high labor costs, leading to soaring costs. Slow sales have resulted in accumulating losses. Only the cotton yarn and rubber industries are still able to make a profit, mainly because of the abundant raw materials and low purchase prices. In particular, the rubber industry is in a unique position to succeed, as it has fixed distribution agreements with retailers in various regions. The amount of goods allocated is adjusted based on sales, so market prices fluctuate accordingly. The production volume of each manufacturer can meet the needs of stores in various regions. There are approximately 30 rubber companies, with the Greater China Rubber Factory being a leader. The rise and fall of pricing is based on this factory.</p>
<h3>Groceries and Hardware: Weak and Declining</h3>
<p>Previously, zinc sheets were expensive due to shortages, with No. 7 and 8 sheets reaching 1.2 million yuan per barrel. Now, with a large influx of goods from Hong Kong, prices have fallen to 800,000 yuan per barrel. Recently, there has been a significant arrival of Hunan-produced manganese powder (manganese dioxide) in Shanghai, with the price per ton falling from 600,000 yuan to 450,000-500,000 yuan. Domestic carbon rods are sufficient to supply the manufacture of batteries, and production costs are lower than imported products. Small rods cost about 9 yuan each, while German carbon rods in stock cost 40 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Food Grains: Weak and Falling</h3>
<p>The rice market received a total of more than 13,000 shi from the north and south. Sales were sluggish. In the southern market, prices were firm in the morning but weakened in the afternoon. Both japonica and indica rice lacked upward movement. White Yuan and Yin Yuan rice were reduced decisively. The northern market was stagnant. Japonica and indica rice both fell by 1,000 yuan. Secondary White Yuan rice also fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. The demand for soybeans from other areas weakened. Oil mills were reluctant to buy, with prices falling slightly by 300-500 yuan. The Fuzhou and Xinghua merchants took a small amount of bean cakes, but transactions were limited, with prices falling by 100 yuan. Both arrivals and sales of broad beans were scarce, with a flat trend. Southern Yang groundnuts remained unchanged, continuing to fall by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Although the supply of sesame seeds was not large, poor digestion led to a decline of 1,000 yuan. Green beans from the 爾洋 were being actively processed, and high-quality beans saw an increase of 1,000 yuan, while medium-quality beans remained flat. Bran remained unchanged, with a slight increase of 200-300 yuan. Flour continued to decline gradually, with miscellaneous brands falling another 100-200 yuan. Wheat also softened considerably. Oil merchants were optimistic about the arrival of goods from the north, and prices weakened.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Weaving Industry: Urgent Plea for Yarn Allocation and Relief</h3>
<p>Representatives of Wuxi cloth factories who came to Shanghai to petition stated that before the war, there were more than 9,000 looms in Wuxi, producing more than 10,000 bolts of cloth per day. Unfortunately, the Japanese invaders caused severe losses, and now it is only four-tenths of pre-war levels. Since the summer, cloth sales have been extremely slow, while raw material expenses have risen monthly. As a result, more than a dozen small factories have been forced to close. It is regrettable that the yarn allocation in Shanghai only considers the city itself and not other areas. The price of yarn in Wuxi is one-third higher than in Shanghai, which threatens the sale of cloth. It is urgently hoped that the authorities will take fair measures regarding yarn allocation. It is reported that several factories with issuing offices in Shanghai are planning to consult with the Dyeing and Weaving Association to lease the idle looms of various weaving factories in Shanghai to weave cloth on their behalf in order to get allocated yarn. Cha Bingchu, chairman of the Changzhou Chamber of Commerce, has already contacted the Dyeing and Weaving Association on behalf of the factories in other areas to discuss this matter.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Purchase: 6,000 Bales, Foreign Sales to US, France, and India</h3>
<p>[Our News] The Central Trust Bureau has purchased raw silk in fifteen batches, totaling 6,020 bales. The first to tenth batches total 4,765 bales, the eleventh batch 290 bales, the twelfth batch 65 bales, the thirteenth batch 200 bales, the fourteenth batch 500 bales, and the fifteenth batch 200 bales. It is reported that the Bureau plans to purchase 10,000 bales within the year. This batch of raw silk is currently being prepared for foreign sales. So far, only a few transactions have been completed. Jardine Matheson has sold 140 bales to the United States, 連納洋行 60 bales to France, and 三星洋行 10 bales to India. The transaction price, based on the D grade standard, is 2.5 million yuan per bale. This batch of raw silk has not yet been shipped.</p>
<h3>Grouped Exchange of Negotiable Instruments: Pending Decision by Banking and Money Industries</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Clearing House's more than 140 agent exchange firms, the issue of changing to direct exchange for all has been raised. After soliciting the opinions of various firms, the result is that firms above number 50 advocate maintaining the status quo, while more than 100 firms below number 50 advocate changing to grouped direct exchange. It is understood that the Clearing House has drafted a plan for all exchange firms to directly exchange in five groups and has forwarded it to the Banking and Money Industries Association for discussion and decision.</p>
<h3>Remittances from Overseas Chinese Mostly Diverted to Hong Kong: Large-Scale Smuggling between Hong Kong and Guangdong</h3>
<p>[Our News] The total amount of remittances from overseas Chinese last month was 法幣7,026,380,419.96 yuan, including 法幣3,938,124,508.35 yuan and US$78,979.10 from New York, exceeding half. The number of remittances from overseas Chinese has shown a decreasing trend in the past six months. According to experts, there are two main reasons: (1) The official exchange rate of the US dollar is far from the black market rate. If overseas Chinese remit US dollars directly to the motherland, they can only be exchanged at a rate of 3,350, but if they remit to Hong Kong and then convert to Hong Kong dollars, it is obviously more profitable. In addition, the domestic political situation is unstable and production is shrinking, and foreign banks in Hong Kong are attracting funds with high interest rates, so a considerable amount of remittances from overseas Chinese has fallen into the hands of foreign banks in Hong Kong. (2) There is currently large-scale smuggling between Hong Kong and Guangdong, which urgently requires US dollar drafts for payment and is willing to buy them at high prices. As a result, some remittances from overseas Chinese are consumed in this illegal transaction. As for remedial measures, the authorities are studying them. Common sense suggests that there are two points: one is to plug the loophole in Hong Kong, which requires diplomatic efforts, and at the same time, the exchange rate of remittances from overseas Chinese must have preferential measures. The second is to strictly crack down on large-scale smuggling between Hong Kong and Guangdong, because about half of the remittances from overseas Chinese are remitted to Guangdong, so the elimination of smuggling is an indispensable step to increase remittances from overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>British Businessmen's Public House: Difficult to Relocate to Hong Kong to Resume Business, Transfer of Foreign Shares is in Progress</h3>
<p>[Our News] The British Businessmen's Public House, which was engaged in foreign stock trading in the city before the war, is currently in the process of liquidation. Due to the establishment of China's stock exchange, the Businessmen's Public House decided to dissolve. The Public House originally had more than 90 brokers, half Chinese and half foreign. Currently, all the Chinese brokers have joined the stock exchange. As for the foreign brokers, their movements are inconsistent. At the beginning of the victory, the manager of the Public House, 巴文道, left for England due to family affairs, so the liquidation work of the Public House was handed over to the deputy manager 實台克 to preside over. Many of the other foreign brokers went to England last autumn. Another group went to Hong Kong to seek development. A small number of foreign brokers have joined China's stock exchange activities in the name of companies. The main business of the Public House's liquidation work is the transfer of various foreign shares. After eight years of occupation by the enemy and puppets, the property rights are chaotic, so the transfer is particularly cautious. Also, the Shanghai Businessmen's Public House cannot be moved to Hong Kong to resume business. Because there are already two institutions in Hong Kong that operate stock trading, one is the Hong Kong Businessmen's Public House and the other is the Hong Kong Co., Ltd. In the future, the two will be merged and then resume business, but the time is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>Bleached Tung Oil and Hankou Telegram Surge</h3>
<p>Although the export of bleached tung oil is not smooth, the production area has gradually increased. Recently, a telegram was received from Hankou, stating that it has been sold at 125,000 yuan per barrel. Compared with the previous market, it has increased by more than 10,000 yuan, which seems unexpected. In general, foreign trade is limited by the exchange rate and is indeed difficult to calculate. However, it is reported that recently, most exports are transshipped to foreign countries from Hong Kong, probably settled through the black market exchange rate. The increase in Hankou may be due to this. However, Shanghai has no solution, resulting in no foreign trade for a long time. It can be said to be sighing at the ocean. Because Hankou has increased, although the domestic sales season is declining, it cannot help but echo. Wholesale sales of each brand have also increased to 136,000 yuan, and sales are very light.</p>
<p>The sales of Hongjiang tung oil are not in season. Originally, winter was the time to prepare for spring sales, but recently, due to excessive interest rates, early preparation is beyond reach. It is estimated that it will be necessary to prepare for sales when they are close. The sales prices of various Western brands have also increased slightly with bleached tung oil to 115,000-116,000 yuan per barrel.</p>
<h3>Today's Opening: Silkworm Seed Improvement Design Committee, Three Main Topics to Be Discussed at the Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our News] The Silkworm Seed Improvement Design Committee, originally scheduled to be held yesterday, was postponed to the 27th due to insufficient preparation time. The main topics of the meeting are three: (1) The issue of China adopting the European system of silkworm seeds. There are three systems of silkworm seeds in the world: one is the European system, which is characterized by high silk yield but weak constitution; one is the Chinese system, which is characterized by low silk yield but strong constitution; and the other is the Japanese system, which is between the two. For the long-term development of the silk industry in a country, it is beneficial to adopt the European system. In the future, if China adopts the European system, it can use various methods to strengthen the constitution of European system silkworm seeds after several years. On this point, the opinions of the people and the government are the same. (2) The silkworm rearing equipment in various parts of China is too simple, which is not suitable for the development of improved varieties. In the future, the 蠶種局, representatives of the people, and personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture will form an investigation team to inspect the 機場 in various places. If they do not meet the standards, they will be prohibited from continuing to use them. This issue will also be discussed in detail at this meeting. (3) China's silkworm rearing regulations have been formulated for a long time. Due to changes in objective circumstances, some points are no longer applicable and need to be revised. This will also be studied in detail at this meeting.</p>
<h3>British Textile Expert Talks About Improving Silk</h3>
<p>温博登, a textile expert and member of the British Business Delegation to China, visited Japan to investigate the current situation of silk restoration and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. According to reports, the damage to Japanese silk during the war was not significant, and it is currently actively restoring its original state. China has always been a silk country, and its products have a considerable position internationally, but if it cannot improve varieties and reduce costs, it will be difficult to compete with Japan. The reason why Japan's silk industry can recover quickly is nothing more than better varieties, more modern equipment, and higher production volume. Therefore, in order to save the crisis of China's silk industry, 温氏 believes that the first step should be to reduce native species and use new methods of silk reeling. The second step is that the buying and selling of silkworm cocoons should be based on dry cocoons instead of fresh cocoons, because it is not easy to determine the quality of silk reeling from fresh cocoons. Dry cocoons can be drawn at any time for inspection to determine their quality.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Are Not Easy to Increase</h3>
<p>The cost of raw silk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has reached 7 million yuan per dan. The purchase price of the Central Trust Bureau is only 5 million yuan at most. The silk reeling industry cannot afford the losses. The person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau said that the pain of the silk industry should be sympathized with, but the difficulties of the government should also be taken into account. The spring silk has not been collected yet, and the autumn silk has not started yet. Whether the silk price will change again in the future depends on the government's decision.</p>
<h3>Increased Production of Japanese Silk</h3>
<p>[Reuters Tokyo, 25th] According to the monthly report of the Silk Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the production of Japanese raw silk in September was 8,992 bales, slightly higher than in August. However, the number of new silk reeling basins installed in September was far more than in the previous month, almost tripling. The production of silk fabrics has not yet increased, as textile factories are rushing to manufacture a batch of silk goods designated for export.</p>
<h3>Egypt Plans to Promote Long-Staple Cotton to France, Italy, and Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 25th] The Egyptian government plans to find markets in France, Poland, Italy, and the Czech Republic to promote Egyptian long-staple cotton, causing rumors that Egypt may borrow from London to achieve this goal. However, the British cotton industry severely criticized this proposal, saying that first, the amount of this loan should be as high as 20 million pounds, which will inevitably create cotton prices that are unfavorable to the British cotton industry; and second, this loan will inevitably deepen the trend of domestic inflation in Egypt.</p>

The chairman, the representative of Mexico, 貝茲, submitted China's five proposals to a sub-committee for research.</p>

<h3>Sino-Foreign Amateur Boxing Tournament: Chinese Win Four of Eight Championships</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Association-sponsored 35th Annual Municipal Amateur Boxing Tournament was held last weekend, attracting an unusually large crowd. The competition was divided into eight weight classes. The preliminary rounds were highly competitive, and the semi-finals were also very tense. However, the finals were not as exciting as hoped, as some groups were internal clashes. Dr. Kong Xiangxi also attended, and as honorary chairman, gave a speech on stage, which was warmly welcomed by the audience with continuous applause. The results of the finals showed that the strength of the Chinese boxers was not weak, accounting for half of the eight championships. Cheng Renfa of the China Youth won the 118-pound class, Ma Gaoshi won the 126-pound class, Zhou Shibin of Jingwu won the 147-pound class, and Gu Boling won the 160-pound class. Tang Lizhi and Laolishi of the Portuguese Businessmen's Association won the 112-pound and 135-pound championships respectively. The remaining sub-100-pound and heavyweight classes were won by Xuan Xuemao and Bi Ta's Wei Xingbo of the Huixi Association. Liang Zhao'an, the Sports Department Director of the association, awarded the prizes on the spot, and the championship belt was placed around the waist of the winner. The runner-up also received a gold medal as a souvenir. The results of each class are as follows:</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Inspects Various Districts Yesterday; Personally Checks Household Registration at Various Bao; Citizens Express Respect and Joy</h3>
<p>Yesterday (26th) morning at about 8 AM, Mayor Wu, accompanied by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, inspected household administration, sanitation, and the progress of self-governance in the 11th District (Xincheng). He was accompanied by Wang, the District Head, and Xia, the Deputy Director of the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau, for the inspection, including the offices of the District Office and the Xincheng Sub-bureau. Subsequently, he personally went to the 25th Bao of Qingdao Road Lan Yuan Lane to check household registration, then to the 70th Bao of Dawen Road Siwen Li. Finally, he went to the 56th Bao of Zhangjia Garden on Wujiang Road to inspect, personally checking the household registration of each Bao, totaling more than ten households, all of which were accurate.</p>
<p>He then inspected the 2nd District Office for a week, accompanied by the District Head to check the 30th, 17th, and 5th Bao, which had the most complex household registration in the district. The Mayor first checked Hongxing Li in the 30th Bao. Then, according to a report from the 17th Bao, Ba Chuan Bank had moved in for more than half a year and repeatedly refused to fill out household registration forms despite repeated reports. After learning of this, the Mayor personally led the Bao Head to investigate and reprimanded them, ordering them to complete the registration. Later, he went to the 5th Bao, accompanied by Deputy Bao Head Hu Baorong to check the household registration of the 5th Jia. He personally compared the household registration book with the household plaque, asking about the number of people in each household. The citizens were respectful and joyful to see the Mayor personally checking, The above-mentioned alleys had more complex and special household registration situations, Mayor Wu's personal checks of each household were accurate, with no omissions, which he was pleased with. At 11:30 AM, he left the 2nd District and returned to the City Hall with Director Zhang.</p>
<h3>Regular Implementation of Household Registration; Municipal Government Reaffirms Its Importance</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government believes that household registration is the basis for notarizing the identity of the people and granting them rights and obligations. Whether in public or private law, it is deeply and significantly related to the interests of the people and should be handled with seriousness. The city's household registration began initial registration on September 17, based on the results of the September 17 household census, transcribed into various household registration books. Residents of this city who, after September 17, have matters such as household establishment, removal, emigration, immigration, birth, death, marriage, divorce, recognition, and adoption, must apply for registration within the statutory period in order to obtain legal protection for household registration. All citizens should apply diligently. The Municipal Government reviewed the key points of the Household Registration Law yesterday, issued a notice to its subordinates to comply, and sent letters to the city's party, government, and military agencies for their information.</p>

<h3>Guangxi's Poverty Talk</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in Guilin, Liang Xiaozhong, Guilin Air Dispatch on the 25th</p>
<p>The hungry people here are gentler than lambs. May there be a hundred good shepherds after the administrative meeting adjourns to quickly lead the lambs out of the sea of suffering!</p>
<p>The sufferers in the cold wind need warmth. A political gathering is like sowing a seed full of hope. How many people are waiting for it to grow strong, to find true laughter under the green shade. Some people love flowers without fruit, and more people long for fruit without flowers. This is what the people of Guangxi expect from Guangxi's politics.</p>

<h3>General Zhang Fakui Returns to His First Hometown</h3>
<p>What the provincial local administrative conference brings to the people should naturally be the realization of what is in their hearts. The review and renewal work that has been barren for three years is only now being cleared by more than a hundred "parent officials" on a ruin. The triple vicissitudes of people, time, and place have increased the significance of the conference. Under the enthusiastic welcome of more than 100,000 citizens, Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters Director General Zhang Fakui returned to his "first hometown" (these are the general's own words, and from the general's life of hundreds of battles, it is very worthy of reflection). He stayed in Guilin for three days, attended the administrative meeting, and convened a pacification meeting, leaving a bright light at the intersection of Guangxi's military and political roads. What made General Zhang feel incomparably happy was not the towering decorated archways, grand banquets, and the request to present the title of "Honorary Citizen." When Mayor Su invited General Zhang to be an honorary citizen of Guilin, General Zhang smiled and said, "Guangxi is my hometown, and I also have a house in Guilin. I am already a citizen of Guilin." Rather, it was the achievement of Guangxi's dedicated reconstruction over the past year and the simple and honest "Guangxi spirit." Even when he left Guilin to inspect southeastern Guangxi, his words before departure gave unlimited encouragement to the children of Guangxi. The officials of the administrative conference also enthusiastically carried out the work of the conference under this encouragement. Chairman Jiang's reading award for Guangxi's security and stability over the years has made more people pay attention to this quiet land. On the opening day of the administrative conference, the wise Chairman Jiang also earnestly instructed: "Guangxi Province contributed the most and sacrificed the most during the Anti-Japanese War. Since the victory, the local wounds have not yet recovered, and the people's suffering awaits relief. Administrative personnel at all levels should pay attention to and conscientiously handle matters such as stabilizing order, organizing and training the people, popularizing education, promoting cooperation, and promoting construction." The concise words became the central guideline of the conference. The provincial authorities revealed the slogan of "emphasizing life and growth in construction and seeking stability from progress." Chairman Huang asked the members to "thoroughly review" and to "know everything and say everything," because conferences are often a fresh flower without fruit, a high-profile concert, a self-boasting show. Afraid of the people's headaches, it is naturally best to say as little as possible of irrelevant words. Chairman Huang saw it and considered it a real use of the state's more than 20 million conference funds and the precious time of the ten-day session. Commissioners and county magistrates established four member covenants: "actively make suggestions, earnestly review, cherish time, and reduce entertainment" (naturally, sometimes it is inevitable to send some "special products" and it is inevitable that one or two county magistrates will go in disguise to seek flowers and ask willows). If it is really done, then half of the conference is harvested. A few days of intense meetings and group life training have proven that vitality still fills the entire fiery land of Guangxi. "Cadres decide everything," and the administrative conference has decided the rebirth of Guangxi.</p>
<p>The provincial authorities have declared that the entire plan to rebuild Guangxi is based on the decisions of the Sixth Plenary Session. Also, politics must be democratic, economics must be democratic, and education must also be democratic. Therefore, the administrative conference is a democratic administrative conference. In the wave of democratic construction, this reporter is willing to write a few facts that are not worth underestimating from a glimpse of the leopard, and report on the pain of the people of Guangxi on the road to democracy.</p>
<h3>The Number of County Magistrates Subject to Disciplinary Action Accounts for Approximately 80%</h3>
<p>As Chairman Huang said, "Guangxi has suffered the most tragic changes, unprecedented war destruction, and unprecedented famine, not only has the province's years of construction been destroyed in one fell swoop, but the entire society has also become a broken ruin." Politically, from cleaning up the chaos and mutual conflicts of the war period to returning to stability, how much helpless slaughter has been experienced in the middle, from the rampant evil officials to the return to silence, and how much rectification and clarification have been experienced, the struggle when human nature and reason cannot stand side by side, the establishment of the "political system"… writing it down is truly an interesting story. As for today's politics, how much has it gotten on track? Naturally, when praising, one can praise it as much as possible, such as the progress of security work, the soundness of local institutions, the excellence of the personnel system… counting down, almost everything is perfect and everything is good. Occasionally, when "earnestly reviewing," there is still room for discussion. What should not be said cannot be embellished. I remember that Supervisor Bai Pengfei (from Guangxi) once said, "Recent county magistrates do not put a few together as one, and build them to be qualified to be parent officials." An interesting statistical chart states that as of the end of the thirty-fourth year, the number of incumbent county magistrates in Guangxi subject to disciplinary action accounted for 79.20%. This is the government's evaluation. As for the "cadres" and the people's evaluation in their hearts, it is naturally another matter. Looking deeper, security work is good, but one must ask more about recuperation, reducing government and being close to the people; local institutions are sound, but one must ask more about administrative efficiency; personnel systems must also ask about selecting the worthy and the capable… it is a long story, and a grand theory seems irrelevant, but it will never be groundless. The answer is placed on the puzzle, that's all.</p>

<h3>Director of Construction Speaks of Poverty, Comparing Himself to a Beggar Leader</h3>
<p>Construction is an extremely difficult task in Guangxi. Rebuilding everything is the unanimous request of more than 13 million people. However, today's situation can be described with the eight words "empty of people and wealth, industry and commerce withered," writing out the suffering of this province. In addition to the fact that talent is simply unimaginable, whether it is everything waiting to be started and then stopped, it is like Clausewitz's view of the elements of war: "First, money; second, money; third, still money." Not to mention anything else, from a financial point of view, October is over, and the funds have not yet been settled, causing all measures to fall into a state of paralysis, so that the Director of Construction told General Zhang Fakui that he was a "beggar leader." Transportation needs to be restored, but requests for funds are not approved. Constructing farmland irrigation, the Relief Administration is "more than capable but less than willing" and unwilling to help. It seems that construction is only Guangxi's family affair. The government completely neglects or rather favors the construction work of some provinces, which is an undeniable fact. Since the revision of the fiscal revenue and expenditure system, it has simply been stretched to the limit. The total monthly income of Guangxi's poor counties is truly regrettable when spoken of, but only two million yuan (such as Zhenjie, Pingxiang, etc.), which is less than a meal for a wealthy person at sea. Therefore, more than 30 cities and counties need provincial subsidies, totaling more than 830 million yuan. Pulling up and down, the word "construction" has vanished from it and turned into a short-term measure. Since local income is low, various tricks are used, resulting in the state of "now there is nothing left to donate." At the administrative meeting, Director Yang reported that there were as many as eleven kinds of local rents and taxes, how can the people bear it?</p>
<h3>Rural Recovery Is Less Than One in Ten</h3>
<p>The basic of construction is inseparable from the revival of the countryside. In Guangxi, the recovery of the countryside is "less than one in ten." Coupled with heavy oppression, "that one" is almost falling. The greatest suffering of farmers is nothing more than the exploitation and extraction caused by land rights. The provincial order to reduce rent by 25% must be completed before autumn, but only 36 counties reported the exchange (Guangxi has one hundred counties (whether it has really been done is still a question). Nearly seventy counties that have not reported the exchange show how the dark forces in the locality are bullying the ignorant farmers. In addition, Guangxi's total land tax was 2.5 million yuan in the early Republic of China, but suddenly increased to 7.8 million yuan in the thirty-second year. Adding requisitions and surcharges, the amount to be borne is an astronomical figure. Requests for reduction and exemption have been made repeatedly, but to no avail. Hunan went to ask and obtained a quarter. These things sometimes make the people of Guangxi feel a little sad. Rural bankruptcy, what is there to talk about construction? Therefore, there seems to be a kind of contemplation and anxiety about the issue of construction at the administrative meeting. It is generally believed that there is no other way but to rely on self-reliance. For example, there are no less than 400,000 mu of wasteland in each county, but only 50,000 mu are being reclaimed. In addition to the automatic construction by the people in rich counties, the construction of water conservancy is not top-notch. To be frank, the lack of people and money is the reason, and the irresponsibility of the responsible persons is also the reason.</p>
<p>The administrative conference has no specific measures to support industry and commerce. However, Chairman Huang once said the premise of support: "At present, private capital in Guangxi is still very thin and has not reached the stage of restraint. On the contrary, it should be encouraged." This can be regarded as a kind of method. However, private capital in Guangxi may first promote the way out of bureaucratic capital. Otherwise, how can such a large "trade company" be run? The rulers have good intentions, but reality is a layer of shadow. The revitalization of industry and commerce must start with politics.</p>
<p>Active construction is the best way to relieve the people. The administrative conference is the cradle of constructing a new Guangxi. On the land full of famine and poverty, people are waiting in silence for bright flowers to bear strong fruits. In the past few days, the parent officials have been complaining about poverty and suffering, and have also put forward valuable measures and precious opinions. Dimness is one side, and light is also one side. Now is the time when light and darkness are fighting!</p>
<p>Attached is an interesting episode. After Director Zhang came to Guilin before the administrative conference, the provincial authorities convened the heads of various agencies to report the difficulties of administrative work to Director Zhang. Everyone unreservedly reported the word "poor." Director Zhang expressed great sympathy and agreed to immediately transfer requests such as repairing highways and exempting the telecommunications bureaus of 26 counties, including Dongnao, to the relevant central departments for handling. Only when Huang Ronghua, the director of the Relief Sub-Administration, reported that there were no ships to transport relief supplies, General Zhang said, "You are not being honest in your report. If you say there are no ships, come with me to Guangzhou to ask for them." Director Huang repeatedly said, "Thank you, Director." Director Huang thanked the Director, and the refugees in Dongjiang Town, Guilin also "thanked the Director." General Zhang passed by the refugee camp and immediately donated 300,000 yuan to them, making the refugees happy. It is unknown what Director Huang felt.</p>
<p>Also, in the speech of Mr. Hu Peide, the representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, at the opening of the administrative conference, he said, "Whether my food has reached the hands of the hungry depends on you, because you are all officials close to the people." It is quite thought-provoking, so it is recorded as "relief anecdotes."</p>
<p>God's followers "gather those lambs." Guangxi's hungry people are gentler than lambs. May there be a hundred gentle shepherds after the administrative conference adjourns to quickly lead the lambs out of the sea of suffering! (Sent on the 25th)</p>
<h3>A Comparison of the Five-Power Constitution and the British and American Constitutions</h3>
<p>— From Our Newspaper's Reference Room</p>
<p>The National Assembly has formally opened in the capital today, and its mission is to enact a constitution. The constitutional blueprint under discussion is the revised draft of the May 5th Constitution, promulgated in the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936] and recently revised, which is to say, a constitution embodying the spirit of the separation of five powers. The Five-Power Constitution was originally created by the Founding Father [Sun Yat-sen] and imbued with his consistent ideal of nation-building. The first article of the Founding Father's late-life "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" stipulated that "the National Government shall build the Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution of the Revolution," demonstrating that the implementation of the Five-Power Constitution is inseparable from the ideals of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>The constitutions of various modern European and American countries mostly adopt the traditional system of the separation of three powers, which is inherently incomplete in principle and prone to many malpractices in practice. After years of meticulous research, the Founding Father selected its advantages, corrected its defects, and based on new ideas and theories, in response to the actual needs of China's nation-building, created the Five-Power Constitution.</p>
<p>The Five-Power Constitution is different from the constitutions of Britain and the United States. What are its characteristics? Why is the Five-Power Constitution superior to the constitution of the separation of three powers? This article intends to conduct a comparative study on these issues.</p>
<p>Let's start with Britain: Britain is an advanced country in constitutionalism, and its constitutional development has gradually evolved over seven or eight hundred years. However, precisely because Britain's constitutionalism has evolved step by step, Britain still does not have an independent and complete legal code. For this reason, people generally call the British constitution an "unwritten constitution." In British history, many famous documents constitute part of the constitution, such as the famous Magna Carta of 1215, the Petition of Right of 1628, the Bill of Rights of 1689, the Act of Settlement of 1700, and the parliamentary election laws of 1832, 1867, 1884, and 1918...etc. At the same time, there are many customs and precedents that have become part of the unwritten constitution because everyone observes them. This is a significant feature of the British constitution. For example, if the British cabinet loses the confidence of the House of Commons, it should resign as a whole or ask the King to dissolve Parliament and hold new elections. However, if the newly elected members still vote no confidence in the cabinet, then the cabinet must resign. This is a long-standing and unchanging practice, but there is no such provision in any written document. Precisely because the British constitution is unwritten, it is also flexible, which means it is easy to amend. For example, the method of parliamentary elections has been changed three or four times before forming today's universal suffrage system. New documents and practices can naturally replace old ones and become part of the unwritten constitution without going through cumbersome constitutional amendment procedures.</p>
<p>Britain is a constitutional monarchy, so in name, the British monarch holds the supreme power of legislation, judiciary, and administration. However, in reality, as everyone knows, the British monarch has no real power because legislative power lies in Parliament (laws must be submitted to the King for approval after passing, but this is only a formality), judicial power lies in the courts (although judgments must use the name "on behalf of the King"), and executive power lies in the cabinet. The Prime Minister of the cabinet is the leader of the majority party, and cabinet members are selected by the Prime Minister. All policies are decided by the cabinet.</p>
<p>This system of responsible cabinet government is the central spirit of British constitutionalism. Under the system of responsible cabinet government, legislative power and executive power are interdependent but also mutually restrained. The cabinet's job is to carry out various government affairs, and the Prime Minister and cabinet members are in fact members of Parliament, who can attend Parliament, participate in discussions and votes, so legislative power and executive power are interdependent. But on the other hand, if Parliament is dissatisfied with the actions of the cabinet, it can propose a vote of no confidence, forcing the cabinet to resign. The cabinet can also request the King to dissolve Parliament to confront it. Here, Parliament is not only a legislative body, but also a body representing public opinion. If the cabinet feels that the Parliament's vote of no confidence does not represent public opinion, then it can request the King to dissolve Parliament and have the voters re-elect members. It can be seen that all decisions are still in the hands of the voters, not in the hands of the King, not in the hands of the Prime Minister, and not in the hands of those members who act arbitrarily. This is the democratic spirit under British constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Parliament should originally be above all else. It can enact new laws, amend or repeal any old laws, propose a vote of no confidence in the cabinet responsible for administration, forcing the cabinet to resign, raise questions, individually impeach members, or reject bills proposed by the government. So, on the surface, it seems that Parliament controls everything. But in fact, the Prime Minister in the cabinet is the leader of the majority party in Parliament. Due to the increasingly strict organization and operation of modern political parties, the cabinet can actually control Parliament in many ways. Because the Prime Minister is the leader of the majority party and the cabinet members are all members of the majority party, then the bills proposed by the cabinet in Parliament will in fact receive the support of its own party (i.e., the majority party) in Parliament. Even if the opposition party rises up to obstruct, the bill can still pass. In this situation, executive power will obviously overwhelm legislative power.</p>
<p>The British constitutional model certainly has its special advantages, but we must not forget that this is what they have achieved through seven or eight hundred years of improvement and evolution. China's constitutional movement is only thirty or forty years old, and the general level of knowledge of the people is not as high as that of Britain. Applying an unwritten and flexible constitution is in fact impossible. Therefore, the Five-Power Constitution should be a rigid, written legal code. Speaking of the implementation of constitutionalism, in the British system of responsible cabinet government, it is difficult to clearly separate legislative power and executive power to seek balance. The result is either Parliament has no power or the government is incompetent. This is inconsistent with the ideals of the Founding Father, so the National Assembly system and the Five-Yuan system can remedy this shortcoming. The Executive Yuan in the Five Yuans only exercises executive power and absolutely cannot control legislative power. At the same time, it is not subject to the control of legislative power. This point is much more advanced than the system of responsible cabinet government. On the other hand, the division of power and ability under the Five-Power Constitution is very clear. The people have the power to control the government, and the government can fully exert its administrative capabilities. In addition, the rights of the people are also clearly stipulated in the Five-Power Constitution and included in the written legal code. It can be seen that the Five-Power Constitution has the advantages of the British constitution without the disadvantages of the British constitution.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about the United States: The constitutional history of the United States is of course much later than that of Britain. On July 4, 1776, the world-famous "Declaration of Independence" was issued, and the "Articles of Confederation" were promulgated the following year. This was the precursor to the American Constitution. In 1787, representatives of the states held a constitutional convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The draft was completed on September 17 of that year, passed by the states the following year, and in 1789, the federal government was established in accordance with the new constitution.</p>
<p>The nature of the American Constitution is the opposite of the British Constitution: it is a written and rigid constitution. The full text of the American Constitution has only seven articles, each of which is divided into several sections except for the fifth, sixth, and seventh articles. The full text of the constitution has only over four thousand words, which is the shortest constitution in the world. Although there are only four thousand words, the implementation of federal legislative, judicial, and executive powers, the relationship between the federal central government and the states, the amendment of the constitution, and the provisions for the freedom and rights of the people are all included in this constitution.</p>
<p>Such a simple constitution is of course clear, but therefore the flexibility must be quite large. Some things can only be supplemented by the usual practices to make up for the inadequacies of the constitution. For example, the President of the United States shall not be re-elected for three terms. There is no such provision in the constitution, but because presidents in the past have never been re-elected for three terms, this has become a practice. However, President Roosevelt broke this practice because he was supported and loved by the people and was elected for four terms.</p>
<p>The American Constitution is a very prominent constitution of the separation of three powers: executive power belongs to the President, legislative power belongs to Congress, and judicial power belongs to the Supreme Court, with mutual restraint and balance. The President is both the nominal and actual head of state (this is very different from the situation in Britain). The President decides policies and is not responsible to Congress for policies. Therefore, under the American constitutional system, executive power and legislative power are completely separated. Congress's impeachment of the President and cabinet members is limited to illegal acts. As for policies, Congress can only let it go even if it is dissatisfied. There is no way to cast a vote of no confidence like in Britain. The President of the United States is elected every four years. If Congress is dissatisfied with the President, it can only prevent him from being re-elected after the four-year term expires, but during his four-year term in office, there is no real way to deal with him.</p>
<p>The United States is a federal country, so its constitution is also a "dual constitution" rather than a "unitary constitution." In other words, the federal government has its own constitution, and each state also has its own constitution. The federal government has its own exclusive powers, such as military affairs and diplomacy, while each state government also has its own exclusive powers, such as education and police. The powers of the federal government in the constitution are enumerated, while the powers of each state are generalized. As for the judiciary, the federal government has federal courts, and each state has state courts, with different organizations. Looking at the overall trend, the American Constitution is biased towards local decentralization. This is due to the history of the American Constitution. The United States first had the states and then organized the federation. In terms of order, the powers of the federation were divided from the states, so the color of local decentralization is naturally particularly strong in the American Constitution.</p>
<p>The American Constitution is also full of emphasis on the protection of individual freedom. Because the constitution's protection of individual freedom in most countries is only for executive power. As for the legislative body, since it represents public opinion, in theory it should have the right to enact laws to restrict people's freedom. However, the amendments to the American Constitution in 1789 added a chapter on the rights of the people, which restricted Congress from enacting laws that interfered with people's freedom. After the Civil War, three more articles were added to prohibit the states from enacting laws that restricted people's rights. This is not common in the constitutions of various countries.</p>
<p>However, the main starting point of the spirit of the American Constitution is the federal political system. Since China has always been a unified, unitary country, such a constitution cannot be applied in many aspects. As for the issue of the division of power between the central government and local governments, the Five-Power Constitution also has the same provisions. Speaking of the Five-Yuan system in the Five-Power Constitution, judging from the organizational relationship between the President and the Executive Yuan, it seems very similar to the British system of responsible cabinet government; but from the point of view of the President's popular election and the powers the President possesses, it is very similar to the American-style presidential system. In fact, the Five-Power Constitution combines the strengths of both. Furthermore, in terms of the mutual relationship between legislative power and executive power, the legislative power and executive power under the Five-Yuan system are neither combined into one like the system of responsible cabinet government, nor are they separated like the presidential system, but rather the legislative, executive, judicial, examination, and control powers can all be used independently and relatedly. Most importantly, the Five-Power Constitution advocates the separation of power and ability, so that political power and governing power will not be confused. This is more advanced and rational than the American Constitution of the separation of three powers.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Five-Power Constitution is very different from the traditional three-power constitutions in the world in terms of spirit, goals, methods, and focus. China's constitutional work has been carried out relatively late. Being late also has its advantages, that is, it is easy to adopt the advantages of various countries' constitutions and seek appropriate remedies based on the experience gained from their implementation. If we study the history of the advanced countries in constitutionalism in Europe and the United States, we can see that the special nature of a country's constitution must have its fundamental reasons for its founding and actual needs. Therefore, unitary countries do not necessarily adopt centralization, such as Britain; and federal countries do not necessarily adopt decentralization, such as the Soviet Union. Understanding this fact, we can know that a constitution cannot be copied and imitated, but must be formulated based on the country's different history and national conditions. Under the Five-Power Constitution, the people have the power to control the government, so the government can be omnipotent without being dictatorial. The powers of the central government and local governments are neither centralized nor decentralized, but are only divided according to the actual needs of the affairs, so that the advantages of centralization and decentralization can be obtained without the malpractices of mutual restraint between the two. This is the spirit of the Five Powers and also the place where the Five-Power Constitution is superior to the constitutions of other countries.</p>

<h3>Chrysanthemum Exhibition in Holland</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Leiden on the 18th, Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper to Ren</p>
<p>The Dutch are known worldwide for their skill in growing flowers. The chrysanthemum exhibition and competition held in the city of Leiden in the autumn of 1946 was a grand event of post-war revival. The exhibition lasted for seven days and attracted 12,000 visitors.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums came from the Far East. In Europe, they are commonly seen in two sizes, large and small. The large ones first came from Japan and existed during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty. Westerners used them for medicinal purposes to treat uterine cramps. The Latin name is Matricaria, and the Dutch name is Moedekruid, which coincidentally matches the Chinese name "女花" (woman flower). It is said that the large and small chrysanthemums exhibited by the Dutch today mostly came from China. The small ones were brought back by the Dutch botanist Rumphius, who traveled to Asia in the fifteenth year of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty. Initially, only one yellow variety was obtained. Therefore, Linnaeus of Sweden gave it the universally accepted Greek scientific name Chrysanthemum, which is like Eastern poets calling chrysanthemums "金英" (golden flower). Later, the large chrysanthemums from China were transferred to England by the Englishman Fortune in the twenty-eighth year of Emperor Daoguang of the Qing Dynasty. Soon, they were spread to the Netherlands via France. The Dutch first held a chrysanthemum exhibition in the sixth year of Emperor Guangxu.</p>
<p>A century ago, there were only forty or fifty kinds of Chinese chrysanthemums in Europe. Since the discovery of Ln-oculate grafting in the twenty-third year of Emperor Daoguang, artificial manipulation has been able to create more and more varieties of flowers with richer categories, such as the English Queen of England, Prince of Wales, Annie Salter, and other strange names. These are mostly the names of florists or the names of dignitaries and women, with no meaning to be found. They are not like the Chinese, who are good at using vocabulary to create new terms, with metaphors such as imperial robes representing yellow, 御白 (imperial white) representing white, 艶陽 (gorgeous sun) representing red, and 楊妃 (Yang Guifei) representing light red, all of which evoke touching aesthetic feelings.</p>
<p>Today, the status of Chinese people overseas is increasing day by day. It seems that this chrysanthemum exhibition, which has the most historical relationship with China, and Westerners vying to tell the old stories of the East, getting its way and spiritualizing its use, can become a heaven-made international beautiful story. After the end of the exhibition, after 630 votes of selection, it was decided that the large white chrysanthemum named Editon Alston was the most beautiful flower in the whole field. I have composed two poems in praise of the white chrysanthemum to mark the celebration, and I dare not compete with Bai Letian [Bai Juyi] for fame. The poems say: "The colors fade, leaving a fragrant and secluded scene, the golden country strengthens the divine state, strive to avoid being misled by the west wind, and send the old sunshine to the white head. Dreams are in the flower for ten thousand ages, and the Shanghai garden expands with deep small windows. Now the national nurture is creating new styles, more valuable than gold, seeing white gold." (White gold, according to the Greek scientific name, is a synonym for white chrysanthemum. The Shanghai garden refers to the old residence at 16 Xujiahui Road twenty-seven years ago.)</p>
<h3>The Anemic Education in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou Dispatch on the 22nd, Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper Liang Feng</p>
<p>Too Few Schools, Too Many People Wanting to Study</p>
<p>The current population of Guangzhou City is 1.2 million, but how many schools are there? There are only nine public middle schools and twenty private middle schools, totaling only enough to accommodate over twenty thousand students. In terms of elementary schools, the number of municipal elementary schools has increased by twenty-two schools compared to the previous semester, with a total of sixty-four schools. There are about eight hundred private elementary schools, which together can accommodate at most fifty thousand people. This is still far from the lowest estimated number of people needing to attend school. Because demand exceeds supply, schools have become rare commodities, leading to rampant malpractices and turning sacred education into commercialization and bureaucratization. If you want to send your child to a public school, you not only have to spend money to maneuver, but also ask for favors. Even if you are lucky enough to pass the first hurdle and get in, what happens after you get in? Tuition is not a problem, and miscellaneous fees are not much. However, what about books and a set of uniforms? This will cost at least tens of thousands of yuan, and the usual paper notebooks, pens, ink, etc., cost an average of two to three hundred yuan per day. If the school is newly built, then you have to donate even the desks and chairs, otherwise the school will have to repair the school buildings, and this amount of money will have to be raised from each student's family. Or the teachers will ask the students to borrow rice, and then simply call it "respect-teacher rice." Adding up these odds and ends, the cost of a student in a semester is at least fifty to sixty thousand yuan. Considering that the current monthly salary of a general civil servant in Guangzhou is only a little over one hundred thousand yuan, it is enough to make you gasp for breath to have one child in school. If you don't have personal connections and can't afford to send your child to a private school, then you have to let them drop out of school or find employment or go into business. It is unknown how many school-age children are rejected outside the school gates by this situation!</p>
<p>As for the education situation in the counties, it is said that the mountains are high and the emperor is far away. No matter how strictly the authorities order that no extra tuition and miscellaneous fees should be charged, they still turn a blind eye, allowing private schools in various villages to compete to charge tuition fees. The fees charged are not twenty or thirty thousand yuan, but are based on grain or rice. Miscellaneous fees include essential foods such as sesame oil. Therefore, when the rural economy collapses, studying becomes a superfluous thing.</p>
<p>The Ratio of Population to Students in This Province</p>
<p>Perhaps you will doubt how many schools there are in Guangdong Province? According to the reporter's investigation, there are a total of ten higher education institutions in the province, including one national university, three private universities, two provincial colleges, three private colleges, and five provincial and private vocational schools, accommodating over fourteen thousand students. In terms of secondary schools, there are 557 schools, including 448 middle schools, 64 normal schools, and 45 vocational schools, with over 141,400 students. As for elementary schools, there are 22,917 schools, including 3,326 central national schools, 16,643 national schools, and 2,948 private elementary schools, with 2 million students. The total number of all levels of schools above is 23,588, with a total of only over 2,155,400 students. If calculated based on the population ratio of this province, there is only one middle school student for every 250 people, and we dare not imagine the number of university students.</p>
<p>In addition, although social education has progressed in number compared to before the war, with folk education centers increasing from 72 to 81, libraries increasing from 54 to 85, and sports fields increasing from 87 to 97, the actual education has been forgotten and is only used as a decoration!</p>
<p>The Schools Themselves Also Have Many Shortcomings</p>
<p>In fact, although there are few schools in Guangdong Province, the schools themselves also have many shortcomings: (1) Taking secondary schools as an example, there are too few normal and vocational schools. Without special skills, it is difficult to gain a foothold in society, and the lack of teachers affects the next generation of citizens. (2) Due to financial constraints, good teachers cannot be hired, and reference books and instruments are all lacking, causing the general level of students to decline day by day, the academic atmosphere to be rampant, and the spirit of learning to be decadent. (3) Schools have become commercialized, education has been tainted with the atmosphere of merchants, and it has even invaded the perfunctory and opportunistic human relations in the officialdom. (4) Due to the lack of vitality in the academic atmosphere itself, it is taken advantage of by treacherous and false people, who seize students as tools for political struggle, and schools as places for competition, inciting student unrest and causing strikes, and many students with weak wills suffer. The authorities are not unaware of the seriousness of the above situation. Yao Baoyou, the director of the Education Department, also frankly admitted that the school buildings of various schools are dilapidated, the equipment is simple, the students' physical fitness is weak, the academic atmosphere is not vigorous, the level is low, and the quality is not excellent. However, due to the shortage of education funds and the meager salaries of teachers, even a clever daughter-in-law cannot cook without rice.</p>
<p>Only a Fraction of the 400 Million Yuan Reconstruction Funds Received</p>
<p>Perhaps you will ask, hasn't the central government already allocated 400 million yuan for education reconstruction? Yes, the provincial government applied to the central government for 3.4 billion yuan, but only a fraction was approved. How is this amount allocated? It is calculated as follows: 10 million yuan for education administration, 146 million yuan for higher education, only 53.6 million yuan for secondary education, 17 million yuan for normal education, 17.4 million yuan for vocational education, 10 million yuan for social education, 140 million yuan for scientific equipment, and a total of 5.68 million yuan for subsidizing the education of refugee children and health education. The total includes nine items of expenditure. From the above figures, we can know that the subsidies received by each school are very few. With such a drop in the bucket of funds, how can schools be rebuilt, how can school equipment be enriched, and how can education not decline day by day?</p>
<p>Although the provincial education authorities here have recently formulated seven guidelines for the entire education: (1) Popularize national education through normal education. (2) Promote local autonomy through national education. (3) Improve national health through national sports. (4) Coordinate economic construction through vocational education. (5) Cultivate a good academic atmosphere through strict discipline. (6) Transform social customs with a good academic atmosphere. (7) Improve cultural standards through scientific research. In order to remedy the crisis facing the extremely anemic education on the surface, this is only a symptomatic method. How to deal with the over 12 million young people who are wandering the streets and dropping out of school is the most urgent issue at the moment. I think the future of education and the trend of culture in Guangdong Province are beyond endurance!</p>
<h3>Glimpses of Eastern Hebei</h3>
<p>— Air Report on the 19th, Our Tianjin Reporter Li Shaolin</p>
<p>On the 14th of this month, the reporter had an opportunity to depart from Tianjin and take a look at the situation in Eastern Hebei along the Beining Railway, only turning back after reaching Shanhaiguan. During this trip, I visited Tangshan, strolled around Qinhuangdao, climbed and gazed from Shanhaiguan, and browsed Beidaihe. However, time was short, and I could only superficially observe the conditions along the way, without conducting in-depth investigations. During August and September of this year, the Beining Railway experienced its most turbulent period, with the Communist army constantly sabotaging the railway day and night. The entire Eastern Hebei region was filled with the smell of gunpowder. In September and October, the National Army took active measures, and the county seats of various counties were successively recovered. After returning from this inspection, I gained a general impression: that public security has largely been restored, but not comprehensively.</p>
<p>Zhang Guizhuang, Junliangcheng</p>
<p>Shortly after the special train left Tianjin, it entered the Zhang Guizhuang-Junliangcheng area, an important rice-producing region in North China. This stretch of paddy fields extends all the way to the edge of the coast near Tanggu. This area was originally saline-alkali land, but during the enemy-puppet period, the Japanese dug canals and established water conservancy projects, using river water to wash and transform it into paddy fields, which are now taken over by our authorities. Near Tangshan, there is irrigation from the Jian River. Near Jie County, the Luan River flows vertically. In the Changli area, there are also several small rivers irrigating the land. This is the rich agricultural region of Eastern Hebei and also the area with the most abundant mineral resources. Although it is the beginning of winter, the reporter did not feel cold along the way. As the train sped along its journey, looking out the window, one could see the desolate fields after the autumn harvest, with thick green wheat seedlings already growing in the fields. Clusters of trees still had some leaves that had not been blown off by the cold wind. Many farmers were working in the fields, giving the impression of great peace.</p>
<p>Tangshan City: Industry and Mining</p>
<p>Tangshan is a city of sixty square li, which developed with the development of the Kailuan Coal Mining Company. It is only half a century old, but now there are more than twenty large industrial and mining enterprises in the city. In addition to Kailuan, the North Hebei Electric Power Company power plant is the source of Tangshan's power. The Railway Bureau's repair factory is currently the largest factory in the country that can repair and build railway locomotives. The Qixin Cement Company is a strong force in future national defense construction. These many industrial and mining enterprises constitute Tangshan's life.</p>
<p>Of Tangshan's population of over 136,000, 39% are workers. Tangshan's prices directly follow Tianjin's. General merchandise comes from Tianjin and is more expensive than in Tianjin. Food is cheaper than in Tianjin, with rice and flour costing 600 yuan per jin, and pork costing 1,600 yuan per jin. The group with the most difficult life in society is still public school teachers, whose salaries range from 30,000 to 50,000 yuan for those with low salaries, and over 100,000 yuan for those with high salaries. The salaries of general workers are mostly 170,000 to 180,000 yuan, so the service conditions of workers are quite good, and there are no serious labor-management disputes.</p>
<p>Ice-Free Port: Qinhuangdao</p>
<p>The elegance of Qinhuangdao's scenery is just like that of other coastal cities, and in addition to being worthy of appreciation, as an ice-free port, it will inevitably have to shoulder an important task this winter. Because after Huludao and Tanggu freeze, all ships can only rely on entering the wharves of Qinhuangdao. However, Qinhuangdao only has two wharves, and both are owned by the Kailuan Coal Mining Company, capable of berthing only six or seven ships. To have it shoulder a major task, it still needs to be strengthened in all aspects. Qinhuangdao is under the jurisdiction of Linyu County and currently has a population of just over 10,000, of which stevedores of the Kailuan Company account for 5,000. Currently, the Administrative Inspector of the First District of Hebei Province is stationed in Qinhuangdao. The district under the jurisdiction of the inspector includes Linyu, Funing, Changli, Luan County, Qian'an, Lulong, and Leting counties, as well as Dushan, a newly established administrative bureau. Inspector Tao Xinru said that Leting and Dushan in the jurisdiction are still occupied by the Communist army, and the security between towns and villages in the recovered counties is still not good. The autumn harvest in Eastern Hebei was good this year, but it was looted by the Communist army, and the common people are suffering from food shortages. He feels that the most serious problems in Eastern Hebei are food and security. To maintain security, the basic method is to strengthen the organization of local militias. He said that the current local militias urgently need to be strengthened.</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan, Beidaihe</p>
<p>The momentum of Shanhaiguan is magnificent. In the midst of the morning mist, I walked onto the gate and looked out into the distance. I saw the mountains to the north, like huge waves stirred up by a hurricane in the sea, stretching endlessly and towering in the sky. The Great Wall vaguely winds above. Looking south, there is an endless sea. The Northeast outside the pass surprised me. It was so quiet that it was depressing. The undulating mountains seemed to be frozen, further emphasizing the feeling of loneliness. On the way back, I strolled around Beidaihe for three hours. Walking into the winter seaside can only give people a sense of desolation. Breaking through this desolation are only sporadic gunshots still intermittently resounding in various parts of Eastern Hebei, but who would want to hear these terrifying gunshots?</p>

<h3>Inside Washington: War Inevitable, U.S. Officials Say "Closer Day by Day"</h3>
<p>— Translated by Our Editorial Department, Original by Mrs. Klapp of Observer Magazine</p>
<p>What exactly are the real difficulties of the current world situation? You should take a look at what's happening behind the scenes in Washington. Public officials will privately tell you that another war is inevitable. They treat this terrible trend as a reality but dare not tell the American people publicly.</p>
<p>Wallace's criticism of the government's foreign policy and his forced resignation as Secretary of Commerce show the seriousness of the situation. But this is just one sign of the difficulties. Here are a few conversations I've heard, which can also serve as a reference:</p>
<p>(1) A young veteran who returned from the Pacific wanted to see the President. He wanted to ask the President to lead the countries in advocating for the revision of the United Nations Charter. The President canceled this appointment at the last minute because he was too busy. Later, this veteran met a Presidential secretary, and he talked endlessly about how the peace plan could be effective. The secretary listened impatiently and suddenly interrupted him, saying, "Young man, don't mess around. We'll fight the Soviet Union at any time."</p>
<h3>Sooner or Later, Real War Will Break Out</h3>
<p>(2) Recently, a government official told me, "Yes, we are currently in a government at war, just like in 1939. We know that a real war will definitely come, just as night follows day. We have no way to stop it, we just feel it getting closer day by day."</p>
<p>(3) At a gathering, I heard a U.S. Senator say, "The gap between the Eastern and Western national groups is already too deep and cannot be mended. Sooner or later, we will have to fight."</p>
<p>(4) A former important assistant in the U.S. State Department admitted that we are engaged in a power race. This race, he lamented, "always leads to the road of war." He explained the concept of "balance of power" and pointed out that the hope for the success of the United Nations depends entirely on the consensus between the Soviet Union and the United States. But he then shocked me by saying: if the two strongest countries cannot stand together, then the United Nations is not established to maintain peace.</p>
<p>World Government: Impractical</p>
<p>If you naively propose the hope of a world government and advocate that it possesses sufficient force to prevent the outbreak of war, then someone will laugh at you for being "impractical."</p>
<p>Few people in Washington harbor such empty hopes. Public officials only verbally praise the United Nations. Once the congressional elections in November are over, you will see the most intense arms race in history.</p>
<p>Not long ago, six members of the House Armed Services Committee returned from an inspection of the Pacific and warned that another Pearl Harbor event may occur in the future. U.S. Air Force General Spaatz has said that the gateway for the United States to be attacked from the north is wide open. General Eisenhower advocated forming a strong army. The Navy needs technicians.</p>
<p>Of course, opinions vary on the timing of the real outbreak of war. One speaker feared that a random event would be enough to cause disaster, such as the recent shooting down of a U.S. plane by Yugoslavia, which may cause war. But most officials know that the countries that oppose democratic countries are very poor economically, so they believe that there are still five, ten, or twenty-five years before the outbreak of war.</p>
<p>U.S. Should Take the Initiative</p>
<p>This year is a congressional election year, and 1948 is a presidential election year. I raise this point because domestic politics and the future of the country are closely related. Very few politicians have imagined what the future war will look like, and even those who have imagined it do not dare to tell the voters frankly, because they remember how much resentment President Roosevelt aroused among the people in 1937 after saying that war was coming.</p>
<p>But these concerns of the candidates may be unnecessary. Many citizens may be willing to listen to constructive opinions. Even fools know that in a future war, the country that strikes first is generally the victor. But this is difficult for our country. We ourselves know, just as our enemies know, that the United States has never taken the initiative in aggression. But scientists tell us that our cities can be destroyed by rocket atomic bombs in a matter of hours. The American people know that other countries can also obtain the secrets of the atomic bomb, and there is no way to defend against the atomic bomb. However, from the nature of the United States, we cannot strike first.</p>
<p>The American people understand this very well. They have become so uneasy that daily life has become a chronic terror. At the dinner table, and in fact in every place, the topic of conversation is currently World War III.</p>
<h3>Germ Warfare is More Terrible Than the Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>We are beginning to fear germ warfare even more than we fear the atomic bomb. Germ warfare does not require a large concentration of industrial work. Highly destructive bacteria can be released to us, and we will know nothing about it beforehand. Many people still remember the influenza epidemic of 1918, when one in fifty people died every month on average around the world. This mortality rate was unprecedented in history. Dr. Clay, former assistant director of the Institute for Scientific Research, predicts that germs as infectious as influenza and as deadly as the plague can kill more people than atomic bombs.</p>
<p>We must be on the front line of the attack in another war. While the State Department is trying to infuse life into the framework of the United Nations, while the Army is engaged in rocket research, testing super-aircraft in the Arctic, and accumulating atomic bombs, is anyone designing how to save our people?</p>
<p>According to the Constitution, the first person to bear this responsibility is the President of the United States.</p>
<h3>Seven Methods the President Should Implement</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>A courageous president should not sit patiently in Washington, just daydreaming. He should act, even if there are places where he occasionally oversteps the bounds. His course of action may be as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Review the entire situation of the Soviet Union to find out what they are planning. Use every possible means, including espionage, to find the facts. The Soviet Union has already used espionage in the United States, Canada, and Britain to spy on our military secrets. In order to maintain peace, there is no reason to oppose our doing the same.</p>
<p>If diplomats and intelligence personnel do not know what the Soviet Union is doing, then they should be punished, and even Secretary of State Byrnes and Senator Vandenberg are no exception.</p>
<p>(2) Design a peace that allows the United States and the Soviet Union to live together in friendship in the same world.</p>
<p>(3) Ask Stalin to hold a summit meeting to jointly consider this plan. Tell him clearly that war will be decided in this meeting, not in many lengthy and fruitless future meetings.</p>
<p>(4) At this meeting, there should be sufficient time to fully discuss our plan and any suggestions that the Soviet Union may make. The President can make concessions when he should, without overemphasizing national self-esteem, but realistically considering any sincere proposal. But he must be absolutely certain that any agreement or guarantee acknowledged or provided by the Soviet Union is reliable and can be implemented.</p>
<p>(5) Before, after, and during the meeting, the President should do everything possible to tell the American people every progress he makes; he should constantly maintain contact with the people through radio.</p>
<p>(6) If the Soviet Union cannot accept any plan that does not excessively hurt the emotions of the American people, or if the United States feels that the plan drafted with the Soviet Union requires the United States to make too many concessions, then the President should take another route. He should convene military and economic advisors and ask them to draft a plan for a full-scale war against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(7) Promote the implementation of a six-month or one-year mobilization plan in the United States, stipulating a definite date for the reorganization of armaments and mobilization.</p>
<p>If we make all the concessions that do not harm our national dignity, and the Soviet Union still insists on going its own way, then we will be compelled to propose this solution to the Soviet Union: You must make some concessions for peace, or we will fight.</p>
<p>In this situation, nine times out of ten, the Soviet Union will adopt a more compromising attitude and change its foreign policy. They may even accept a world government, giving it sufficient power to maintain peace. In this way, our position will be determined, and the currently unbearable worries can come to an end.</p>
<h3>Greece Today: Resisting Communism with All Its Might; Border Areas Engulfed in Gunfire; Facing Three Major Difficulties</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xi from "World Report Weekly"</p>
<p>With the support of Britain and the United States, the Greek government is struggling to maintain its position as the last non-communist country in Eastern Europe. The turbulent political situation at home has deepened the suffering of the Greek people. Greece is the only victorious country still occupied by foreign troops. Greece's economic recovery is slower than that of other European countries, and it relies on external economic assistance to survive. The conservative government, in order to deal with the communists, has neglected the people's freedom.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Greece faces three major problems: (1) national unity, (2) economic recovery, and (3) relations with Eastern and Western Europe.</p>
<p>The Problem of Unity</p>
<p>Greece showed a degree of unity in the short period of 1940-41. King George II did not promote the power of national unity. The King was not popular in the country. He was in power for the first time for a year, and resigned due to suspicion of involvement in the mutiny case. In 1935, he was restored to the throne by the victory of a referendum presided over by the right wing. After Greece was defeated in World War II, the King fled again. On September 1st of this year, a referendum voted 75% in favor of restoration, and he returned to the country for the first time and was restored to the throne. Today, Greek leftists accuse the King of not encouraging the anti-Japanese war group led by the Communist Party during the German occupation, and of supporting the Greek government controlled by the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>The Communist Party, the mainstay of the left-wing united front, has also not been helpful to national unity. The Communist Party led the anti-Nazi underground work during the German occupation, which was indeed remarkable, but it was despised by the majority of Greek nationals because of its hostility towards non-communist resistance groups and its abuse of violence against compatriots who did not join the left wing.</p>
<p>Since the liberation of Greece in October 1944, the Communist Party has lost power. When British and Greek troops drove the German army out, the Communist Party actually controlled Greece, but joined the united government recognized by Britain. In 1944, civil war broke out due to a dispute between the left-wing united front and the Greek right-wing group and British Commander Scobie. The Greek government, with Scobie's support, refused to replace the right-wing prime minister with a neutral person. The left wing convened a mass meeting in Athens to show resistance. The masses and the police exchanged gunfire, and the internal chaos intensified from then on.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden flew to Athens on Christmas 1944 to mediate the Greek civil war. They persuaded the Greek exiled king to appoint Archbishop Damaskinos as regent and to appoint an anti-imperial figure who had lived abroad for many years as the Greek Prime Minister. However, the British and Greek government troops continued to pursue the left-wing troops, forcing them to the northern border until a ceasefire agreement was signed. On February 12, 1945, a ceasefire agreement was established in Varkiza, stipulating that the Communist army should immediately surrender its weapons, and that the Communist Party and the left-wing united front should have legal status, and that elections and referendums should be held within a year to determine the Greek political system.</p>
<p>The election was finally held on March 31, 1946, but the left wing refused to vote, accusing the Greek government under British control of intimidating voters and not allowing them to vote freely. However, people from Britain, the United States, France and other countries believed that the election was fair and impartial, and the British occupation army did not interfere, and the left wing's abstention did not affect the election results.</p>
<p>The current Greece is the world of royalists. Most of the people in Greece are small farmers. 96% of the farmland is less than 25 acres, and most of it is less than 10 acres. The royalists used the farmers' fear of communism, telling them that the republic would turn their country into a puppet regime of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Communist Party continued to use violence against political enemies, which invisibly promoted this anti-communist propaganda. In such an environment, the victory of the Greek royalists in the referendum on September 1 this year was an inevitable result.</p>
<p>Economic Recovery</p>
<p>The referendum cannot solve the problem of Greece's post-war recovery. Greece is a very poor country and relies on the relief from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to survive. By the end of this year, UNRRA will have provided Greece with US$358 million worth of goods, half of which is food. 60% of Greece's food supply relies on UNRRA. Apart from UNRRA's relief supplies, there are almost no other imports. At least half of the government's revenue comes from selling relief supplies to the public. The Greek government is concerned that UNRRA's agency will end at the end of this year, so it is looking for a way out and wants to borrow 150 million US dollars from the Export-Import Bank and hopes to get British aid. However, if UNRRA Director LaGuardia's proposal to cancel UNRRA becomes a reality, then Greece will inevitably face another difficult year.</p>
<p>Greece has recovered somewhat from the collapse of its wartime economy. Agricultural production has reached several percent of peacetime, and may reach pre-war levels next year. Industrial production is nearly 50% of what it was before the war. But Greece has never been self-sufficient, and a large number of imports are still necessary.</p>
<p>Greece's export industry has not been able to develop due to slow economic recovery. Before the war, Greece's exports were mainly tobacco, olives, and grapes, most of which were imported to Germany. At present, Britain and the United States are buying large quantities of Greek tobacco, but Greece must seek new outlets to fully restore the sales of tobacco and other products. Greek merchant ships lost three-quarters of their number in the war, giving a serious blow to Greek finances.</p>
<p>These economic difficulties are enough to affect the political trends. Observers believe that Greece, on the verge of starvation, is in danger of being forced onto the path of communism. Therefore, the British and American authorities regard the Greek economic recovery problem as more important than the political stability problem. They feel that after the former is solved, the latter can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Relations with Europe</p>
<p>In addition to domestic affairs and economic problems, Greece's relations with Europe are also a thorny issue. The Greeks used active underground warfare to drive Mussolini's invading troops back to Albanian territory, preventing the German army from invading and containing several divisions of the German army. Therefore, Greece hopes to gain the sympathy of the United Nations and demand compensation from Italy and Bulgaria, cede a piece of land in southern Albania, i.e., Northern Epirus, and strengthen the Greek-Bulgarian border.</p>
<p>But on the contrary, Bulgaria, which helped the Germans occupy Greece, asked the Paris Peace Conference for an outlet to the Aegean Sea through Greece under the encouragement of the Soviet Union and refused to pay reparations. At the same time, Albania hopes that the Soviet Union will support her in maintaining her claim to Northern Epirus. In addition, the Soviet Union group in the Paris Peace Conference accused Greece of making territorial demands that could cause a new war.</p>
<p>Within Greece, the political views of the various parties are quite different. The Greek government and neutral parties fully support the demands of the royalists. The Communist Party initially adopted a moderate attitude, but after being severely criticized, finally put forward a request to revise the border. However, the Communist Party of Macedonia took the opposite view. The Greek right-wingers believe that the Greek and Bulgarian Communist Parties in Macedonia have close ties.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem of Greece is that her government is a right-wing government supported by the British army, and there is no second country of its kind in Eastern Europe under Soviet influence. Although the Greek royalists currently have the upper hand, the activities of the domestic Communist Party and the pressure from communist countries on its northern border are still the most serious problems in Greece today.</p>
<h3>U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Walter Bedell Smith: Important Mission, Influencing the World Situation</h3>
<p>The improvement or deterioration of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union is indeed closely linked to the safety of the world. From this point, one can see the importance of the mission of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, General Smith. When the Paris Peace Conference was convened, Smith was also summoned by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes to attend and participate, which is another clear demonstration of the U.S. government's emphasis on the position of Ambassador to the Soviet Union. However, the reversal of U.S.-Soviet relations during the conference will make the Ambassador's future work more difficult, because since he presented his credentials in Moscow, what he has strived for is to promote the improvement of U.S.-Soviet relations and mutual understanding.</p>
<p>But this man, who once served as Chief of Staff to General Eisenhower, is not easily discouraged, because difficult work is simply commonplace for him. Smith's tenacity earned him the nickname "Bulldog" from Churchill. His experience in World War II was a series of difficult tasks. From the landing in North Africa to the victory over Germany, no task was easy, and he completed them all.</p>
<p>Patience and Candor</p>
<p>Smith is a pragmatist, and he felt from the beginning that patience, time, and candid discussions were necessary for the success of his mission to the Soviet Union. There were varying opinions as to whether Smith was suitable for the position of Ambassador to the Soviet Union. The general consensus was that he had learned how to get along with the Soviets in the school of war. In addition, the Soviet Union has always looked at soldiers with outstanding military achievements in a different light, and Smith's reputation is enough to meet this requirement.</p>
<p>But this opinion is actually secondary. What should be emphasized more is that Smith has always been known for being straightforward and not fond of subtle diplomatic rhetoric, which is to Moscow's liking. In addition, Smith also has the ability to describe things very clearly and in detail, which is an indispensable element for a diplomat responsible for reporting the situation of another country to his own government. Smith's past experience is also outstanding. When he served as Chief of Staff of the Western countries, he had a very clear understanding of the political and military situation of the world during the war, and he had extensive contact with generals from the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Soviet Union, earning him the title of military diplomat. His colleagues often called him "General Manager of the War," and General Eisenhower considered him "the best of all chiefs of staff."</p>
<p>Glorious Deeds</p>
<p>While serving as Chief of Staff, Smith planned the detailed military strategies for the landing in Europe and the direct assault on the heart of Germany. He represented General Eisenhower in signing the unconditional surrender documents of Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Smith is sturdily built, with the appearance of an athlete, and his brown hair is already a bit gray. He speaks concisely and accurately, and occasionally gets angry, but always with restraint. When necessary, he can be cold and ruthless, but usually, he is full of warm sympathy. There are few anecdotes about this military diplomat, but those who have worked with him in the military know that he has a peptic ulcer, so when he is a little more irritable, people always diagnose him and say that his stomach problem is acting up again. What role this stomach problem plays in diplomacy is, of course, impossible to say, but sometimes it is a good excuse to avoid the constant toasting and drinking at Soviet banquets. Smith is not very interested in social activities, but he is very knowledgeable about chess and bridge. He is used to handling heavy military work, so he finds these small games easy to handle, and his opponents have a hard time dealing with him. His wife, a tall, gentle woman, accompanied him to Moscow. She is not willing to show her face in public and prefers to let her husband represent everything in the family.</p>
<p>Impressions of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Smith's impressions of his months in the Soviet Union are as follows: "The Soviet people are extremely practical people. They suffered deeply during the war years, so they are not emotional when it comes to their country's important interests. They are not willing to easily sign important agreements..."</p>
<p>When he returns to Moscow after the end of the Paris Peace Conference, due to the international environment, his mission will obviously be more arduous and critical than before.</p>
<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>A Review of the German Question</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>France Worried about Germany's Revival</p>
<p>The Four Foreign Ministers are meeting in New York, and the most important task, in addition to passing the draft of the Five-Power Treaty decided by the Paris Peace Conference, is the most thorny issue, the German question. This is the core of European politics, which needs to be resolved urgently and without delay. The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference should have discussed it long ago, but the results of the French general election made the French political situation completely questionable, so interim President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault could not leave Paris even a step, waiting for the development of the French political situation. France insisted that before the French Foreign Minister arrived in New York, the Foreign Ministers' Conference could only discuss this issue in general terms and could not make any decisions. Therefore, since the opening of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in New York, the German question has not been formally discussed.</p>
<p>Bevin Plan Has Six Key Points</p>
<p>But on the British side, a plan for the solution of the German question has long been drafted and will be submitted by Foreign Secretary Bevin to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is said that the content has six key points: (1) Britain advocates that Germany should be unified politically and economically in accordance with a system that is neither centralized nor federal. (2) Britain believes that the German production volume stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement is still insufficient; therefore, Germany should be allowed to produce 11 million tons of steel annually, and the cash obtained should be used to purchase food; (3) Under the current reparations plan, Britain objects to either the Soviet Union or Western countries removing any industrial equipment from Germany, even if the Soviet Union proposes to retain it in installments. Britain cannot agree. Only when German production increases enough to supply the occupation expenses and provisions of the Allied forces can Britain abandon this view; (4) Britain is willing to merge the British and American occupation zones, but is unwilling to establish an agreement that allows the Soviet Union to remove industrial equipment from Germany as reparations during the period when Germany relies on British subsidies; (5) Britain is still willing to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the management of the Ruhr area's industry within the unified German institutions; (6) Britain intends to propose to prepare to organize a German central mechanism, establish a central civil service corps, which can appoint local government agencies, and have the power to make decisions politically, but ultimately must be approved by the authorities of the occupying countries.</p>
<p>France Anxious about German Revival</p>
<p>France's attitude towards the German question is roughly the same as after the last war; what France seeks day and night is France's security, and what it worries about all the time is Germany's recovery. Recently, French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet also spoke about this in a speech to the French Chamber of Commerce. At present, France is certainly not satisfied with the situation in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, and it cannot agree with the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones, especially the fact that Britain supplies Germany with more coal from the Ruhr area than it supplies France, which has caused unanimous dissatisfaction among the French government and people. Although the foreign policy of the Bidault government maintains a detached attitude, neither approving of Soviet communism nor satisfied with British and American imperialism, in fact, it inevitably leans somewhat towards the British and American sides. But after the Communist Party came to power, the direction of French foreign policy was even more valued by the world. Communist Party leader Thorez also said that France's foreign policy is to prevent Germany from attempting to rearm itself or to control the European continent economically.</p>
<p>UN General Assembly Work Progresses Slowly</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly passed Egypt's proposal on the 19th, asking governments of all countries to "immediately stop religious and racial discrimination." Although there are no concrete measures, the advocacy of national equality is worth our attention. The General Assembly concentrated on discussing the issue of investigating foreign troops stationed in various countries this week. Representatives of the five countries of China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union successively made speeches, explaining the views of various countries. Molotov took the opportunity to expand on the topic, demanding that the U.S. military withdraw from China and demanding that the British military withdraw from Greece. Therefore, this issue has become the focus of contention between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although Britain proposed a compromise plan, it still failed to gain the approval of both the United States and the Soviet Union. How this issue can be resolved is really a major test for the United Nations General Assembly. (November 25th)</p>

<h3>Wine</h3>
<p>— Ye Cao</p>
<p>With the country's recovery, we are also recovering. Carrying simple luggage, from the mountain city that served as the base of the Anti-Japanese War, to Shanghai, where we had lived for more than 20 years and had been away for nine years.</p>
<p>On the night of August 13th, because we went to pick up our fourth uncle, who was ill in the Wuxi Huishan Sanatorium, we got on the train at the South Station, transferred to Suzhou via Jiaxing, and met with our third brother, Xia Guang, in Wuxi. The short journey took nearly three days. I really don't want to try that kind of crowded suffering a second time in my life. Back in Suzhou, we stayed at my third brother's house, and my French sister-in-law treated us very well. We waited for the train back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>In Suzhou, we saw large groups of enemy planes dive-bombing for the first time, in a terrifying night of intense strafing! At that time, no one knew how to fear, and we watched the planes come and go, and the explosions of anti-aircraft artillery shells. Several bridges were blown up, and the train between Suzhou and Shanghai was blocked. After discussing it, we decided to return to our hometown and join the Anti-Japanese War camp.</p>
<p>In these nine years, we ran to Luoyang, Chongqing, Xi'an, and the mountainous Lihuang. There was hardly a year that we didn't flee. Our home was destroyed and rebuilt. We were constantly oppressed by death and tormented by life every day. However, we lived with great energy, optimistically and conscientiously. The tenacity of life has never been greater. My third uncle's family was bombed to death, and we were not sad at all. We held a simple funeral for him. We only knew that we wanted revenge, and we were determined to drive the Japanese devils out of the country. We only had one belief, that the Japanese devils would be driven away sooner or later. We only had one ideal, that we would have a way to deal with things after the victory. Returning to Shanghai, our second hometown, we lived in a relatively spacious house, bought more than 100 bundles of manuscript paper, and wrote about our bitter experiences, supporting ourselves with labor.</p>
<p>We finally won the victory, and we also returned to Shanghai. But the house was occupied by a friend, and the friend didn't have the power to take over the house, so we had to let him live there. We ourselves had to borrow a friend's house and wait slowly.</p>
<p>Working in a newspaper office, the salary could originally support a family of five, but now, it's not enough for one person. No one knows how to live. My wife advised me to make a budget, but I smiled bitterly and advised her to save as much as possible. We have survived the last nine years by saving.</p>
<p>After 1941, our nutrition deteriorated year by year, and my wife and children were often ill all year round, which was frustrating. If we wanted to treat our illnesses, we couldn't think about living. Eating became a problem, so we had to let the illnesses be and talk about them later.</p>
<p>My wife complained, and the children cried constantly, for a long time, as if there would never be an end. At first, I comforted them a few words, but gradually, I became desperate; I was already hoarse and exhausted, and I no longer had the strength to save them. How long can they live? Only God knows!</p>
<p>I lost my ideal of life, but I had no way to transcend this state, and I couldn't help but live on; first of all, I had to settle myself down. What method could I use to make me not see, what method could I use to make me not hear? I learned to drink—the thing I hated most in my life!</p>
<p>Oh, wine, you are my good companion to dispel sorrow, but I am deeply afraid that you will lead me to destruction!</p>
<h3>Listening to the Farewell Performance of the Music Visiting Group</h3>
<p>— Liang You Ting</p>
<p>Recently, music listeners in Shanghai have heard many farewell performances by famous musicians going abroad. From the solo concerts of Si Yigui, Lang Yuxiu, and Gao Zhilan, to the recent farewell performance of the Music Visiting Group, although there were mixed reviews, this is always a vigorous side of Shanghai's music scene.</p>
<p>Some people say that this is a flash in the pan for Shanghai's music scene, because they have all slipped away one by one, and in the future, Shanghai will have fewer and fewer musicians, except for the Municipal Symphony Orchestra and the Shanghai Music Society, which is still growing. However, we should always think positively: they probably don't want to not return, and at the same time, there are many relatively junior musicians in Shanghai who can take this opportunity to slowly improve their skills and status.</p>
<p>Therefore, this time we listened to the farewell performance of the Music Visiting Group, although we were filled with feelings of reluctance, we were also filled with a sense of celebration; because we hope that these people will go abroad to promote our musical skills first, and then bring back a rich harvest.</p>
<p>Returning to the topic, here we should talk about the "farewell songs" of the Music Visiting Group.</p>
<p>The five members of the Visiting Group, except for Mr. Yu Yizu, who was responsible for management, were all performers: Ma Sihong, Ma Sisun, Huang Yuanyin, and Wu Leyi. Among them, Ma Sihong's skills are recognized as those of a master. Everyone may still remember that in the era when the Public Works Bureau did not like the violin so much, he was the "star" of the symphony orchestra.</p>
<p>The first enchanting holiday—also as the overture to this performance—Ma Sihong played three pieces on the violin, all of which were Ma Sicong's proud masterpieces (Rhapsody, Nostalgia, Mongolian Dance); these pieces, especially Nostalgia, can often be heard in Ma Sihong's performance. This is a piece he plays naturally. He closed his eyes and let the "pentatonic" Eastern-style melody slowly float out of the strings, like a girl receiving a lover's passionate kiss. The expression of the performance and the appropriate performance content are equally appreciated. I often feel that in a concert, we not only appreciate the content of the music, but also appreciate the expression of the performers. If you have seen a film by the late Polish pianist Paderewski (who was once the President of Poland)—"Moonlight Sonata"—you should feel his attractive posture in front of the keyboard. In a successful performance, we see that when the performer gives all his life to the piece, it is really too touching!</p>
<p>Perhaps because the "fleshiness" of string music is easier to please, so is the case with the piano solo (Ms. Wu Leyi). Regarding that "combination of Chinese and Western" piece by He Luting—The Cowherd's Flute, I have the same feeling every time I hear it, that is: the piano is underutilized. The Cowherd's Flute is a good piece with Eastern beauty, but its overall structure does not seem to be very suitable for the piano. More precisely, it cannot express the grandeur of the piano.</p>
<p>Regarding Huang Yuanyin's tenor, I have a perhaps very superficial feeling: his volume is not as good as Wu Zhengqian's. In other words, Mr. Huang's volume is slightly smaller, which has been criticized by people when the Visiting Group performed in Beijing last time. The highest note of "How Can I Not Think of Him" is only F sharp raised by a semitone, which should be indifferent to a good tenor, but Mr. Huang feels strenuous. If we criticize Mr. Huang's solo in terms of timbre, volume, range, and expression, we can say this: there is more than enough expression, the range is not enough, the volume is small, and the timbre is quite round, but it is affected by the range not being wide enough, and the timbre is slightly not smooth enough in the highest notes.</p>
<p>There is also a bit of "nitpicking": "How Can I Not Think of Him" seems to be written by Liu Bannong, but both programs of the Visiting Group wrote it as "Hu Shi." I would like to deny it for Mr. Hu Shi.</p>
<h3>Jialing River Notes</h3>
<p>— Zang Zan</p>
<p>A Little Bird</p>
<p>A foggy morning. This is a winter morning, and people expect the sun to appear, but because the sun will definitely appear, the fog becomes even more presumptuous, pouring into the window like coal smoke—the window I opened to greet the sun—along with the fog, there is the river wind from the Jialing River, cold and suffocating.</p>
<p>I was reading a short story by Azolin called "Moth" in bed, and I was surprised by that poor life; why does this generation bury itself in the fire, and the next generation still rushes to the fire!</p>
<p>At this moment, suddenly something rushed into my small room, hit the wall and fell down, falling into the spittoon at the head of the bed... By the time I recognized it as a small bird; the bird was already motionless.</p>
<p>I was afraid it would die, but I thought it was unlikely. Immediately, I got out of bed, moved the spittoon to the corridor, poured out the water, and poured out the seemingly dead bird as well.</p>
<p>I have always known too little about birds. This is a bird a little bigger than a sparrow, a small bird with just fully grown feathers. I thought this must be a bird of the eagle family, if it grew up.</p>
<p>At this time, the bird was lying on the ground, covered with cold water, and not fluttering its wings, but it was indeed not dead. It seemed to be trembling, and one eye would open and close from time to time, looking very strenuous, while the other eye was bleeding. Between the eyelid and the eyeball, there was a feather inserted, obviously from a fight.</p>
<p>The fog came even thicker. I hurriedly put on the quilt. The river was a vast expanse of white light. The boats had stopped sailing. It was very lonely and calm, so quiet that there was no sound.</p>
<p>I looked back at the dying little bird and felt that there was only a little hope if I moved it into the house. Although there was no stove in the house, it could at least make it warmer... But unexpectedly, just as I reached out to catch it, it tried to flap its wings. —It actually struggled to fly up, splashing me with dirty water. Just as I was helpless and almost angry with it, it crashed into the wall again and fell down. I quickly went to catch it again. This time, it didn't treat the white wall as the sky again. It flew over the railing and flew out of the corridor...</p>
<p>Outside the corridor was a vast expanse of fog, emitting a white light.</p>
<p>Immediately, I realized that this bird was too weak to fly far, and it would definitely fall into the river under the fog; even any healthy bird could not fly across the river surface.</p>
<p>But the bird flew away. It just glided down, and tried its best to rush upward, but after rising a little, it glided down again...</p>
<p>I watched it flying hard, flying, flying towards the brightest place, until the white light of the fog completely covered it.</p>
<p>…!</p>
<p>The sun never came out that day.</p>
<p>This little bird and the moth are always entangled with me.</p>
<h3>Unfortunate Woman</h3>
<p>— By Sherwood Anderson, Translated by Wang Rui</p>
<p>A woman from Iowa came to Chicago and booked a room in West Side Apartments. She was about twenty-seven years old. It was said that she came to this metropolis to study music teaching methods.</p>
<p>A young man also lodged in West Side Apartments. The door of his room faced a long, wide living room on the second floor. Across the living room was the woman's room, with the door directly opposite the young man's.</p>
<p>Speaking of this young man, he was gentle by nature. He was a painter named Lyle, but I always thought he would be more suitable as a writer. He was a great conversationalist with strong comprehension, but his painting was not particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>The woman who lived in the room across the hall always left early and returned late every day. Her appearance was similar to the women who came and went on the streets every day. The only difference was that she had a slight limp. Her right leg was deformed from birth, causing her to walk with a limp. She lived in the apartment for three months – she was the only female guest in the apartment besides the landlady – and gradually the men in the apartment began to notice her.</p>
<p>The men only talked about one thing concerning her. When they met in the hallway of the living room, they would stop in front of her door, smile, and whisper. "She needs a lover," they would say, making a funny face. "She may not think about it, but what she really needs is a lover." Old Chicagoans and Chicago men always thought this kind of thing was easy to achieve. When my friend, the young Lyle, told me this story, I laughed, but he remained expressionless. He shook his head. "Things are not that easy," he said. "If it were that simple, writers would have nothing to write about."</p>
<p>Lyle also explained, "Whenever a man approached her, she became frightened." They invited her to dinner, to the theater, but they could not entice her to walk side by side with a man on 通　Street. She never went out at night. When a man stopped in the hallway of the living room to try to talk to her, she would initially lower her eyes to the ground, and then quickly run into her own room. A young dry goods merchant once encouraged her to sit with him on the stone steps in front of the apartment building to talk.</p>
<p>He was an enthusiastic young man. When he took her hand, she cried out strangely. He panicked and stood up, gently touching her shoulder in an attempt to explain, but she was so frightened that she trembled all over. "Don't touch me," she cried, "Don't let your hand touch me!" As she screamed, people strolling on the street stopped to watch. The dry goods merchant hurried upstairs, entered his room, closed the door, and held his breath to listen to the commotion outside. When people questioned him, he said in a trembling voice, "This is really a prank. I didn't offend her. She deliberately made trouble for me. I didn't do anything indecent to her. This is really unexpected. I just touched her arm with my finger, what's the big deal?"</p>
<p>Lyle probably told me the story of this Iowa woman more than ten times. The men in the apartment then began to dislike her. Although she did not expect anything from them, she never wanted them to be alone. She continued to interact with single men, and she always protested loudly when they touched her. This trick was performed at least a hundred times. When she took a nude bath in the bathroom facing the living room, she always left the bathroom door ajar, regardless of how many men passed by. In the first-floor sitting room, when people were sitting on the sofa chatting, she would silently sit down facing them. She leaned on the sofa, her lips slightly parted, her eyes gazing at the ceiling. Her whole life seemed to be waiting for good fortune to come. Everyone knew when she was in the room, but the men standing there pretended not to see her. They chatted and laughed loudly. When everyone was tired and had nothing to say, they would leave quietly, one by one, one after another.</p>
<p>One evening, the landlady evicted this unfortunate woman. Someone, perhaps the dry goods merchant, had told the landlady something, and she immediately obeyed. "It would be better if you left tonight." Lyle heard the landlady say this. She stood in front of the Iowa woman's room, and the landlady's eviction notice echoed throughout the apartment.</p>
<p>The tall and thin painter Lyle would fight for his ideals with his whole life. The passion in his soul completely sublimated the desire for sex. His income was small, and he had not yet married. Perhaps he had never had a lover. It was not that he had no carnal desires, but he did not consider carnal desires to be the most important thing in life.</p>
<p>On the night the Iowa woman was evicted from the West Side apartment, she went into Lyle's room after waiting for the landlady to go downstairs. It was about eight o'clock in the evening, and he was reading a book by the window. She did not knock on the door before opening it. She didn't say a word, but rushed to Lyle and knelt down. Lyle said that her twisted leg made her run like an injured bird, her eyes were burning, and she was breathing rapidly. "Embrace me," she said, leaning her face against his knees, trembling all over. "Embrace me quickly. I should be married at this age. I can't wait any longer, you should possess me immediately."</p>
<p>Of course, you can imagine how embarrassed Lyle was at this time. According to what he told me, he had been indifferent to the woman until the night the tragedy of the proposal was staged. However, I think that among all the men living in the apartment, he was the one who could treat her more impartially. Then, the situation in the room gradually escalated. The landlady broke into Lyle's room, and now two women were in front of him, the stronger casting a predatory gaze on the weaker. The Iowa woman knelt trembling, almost shrinking into a ball at his feet. Lyle's heart was pounding. He had a whimsical idea and put his hand on the kneeling woman's shoulder, shaking her violently. "Don't worry now," he said quickly, "I will definitely keep my promise." Then he turned to the landlady and smiled: "We are engaged," just waiting for the wedding to take place. We all had an argument. She knelt into my room and snuggled up to me. She is not in good health and is very emotionally agitated. I'm going to take her away. Please don't worry. I'll take her away."</p>
<p>After the woman and Lyle left the apartment, she took his hand and stopped crying. The fear she had felt when she was with single men also disappeared. He found her a room in another apartment, and then accompanied her to the park and sat on a bench. They talked until twelve o'clock at night. He and she had met and talked many times before. It seemed that there was no progress in their relationship. She went back, and I guess she probably quietly returned to her hometown in Iowa!</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 105</h3>
<p>— By Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>At this moment, the music on the stage suddenly stopped, and the lights became brighter. The couples on the dance floor also returned to their seats. This made it somewhat difficult for both Hejian to handle the situation. Coincidentally, at this moment, the leader's aide came up and reported that Hejian's driver was waiting in the hall. This broke the stalemate. Hejian performed the usual "sorry" social scene, temporarily excused himself, but left the cigarette behind to represent himself, so as not to make her feel too lonely.</p>
<p>This chauffeur was Hejian's subordinate, 29 years old, a mixed-race Japanese and 高　. He was also quite handsome, calm and resourceful. In official matters, he was number one hundred and eight, but someone gave him a very inappropriate nickname, calling him "Wild Boar".</p>
<p>"Wild Boar, you came at the perfect time," Hejian said quietly, appearing as if he were instructing his driver. "You are an encyclopedia when it comes to Tokyo. Quickly find a way to sneak into the dance hall. In the dark corner diagonally opposite the dance floor on the left side of the door is my seat. There is a woman dressed in a 服 suit; I want to know something about her. Go quickly... Come back here to find me."</p>
<p>Hejian passed through an arched doorway, bought a cigar at the bar, made a few phone calls in the telephone room, and returned to the hall, where Wild Boar was already waiting.</p>
<p>"Do you recognize her?" Hejian asked.</p>
<p>"I've never seen her before."</p>
<p>"Oh...?!"</p>
<p>"According to Little Line's report, she has never been here, but she performed a solo at the Navy Club's Naval and Marine Corps Gala last month. Her name is Pingzi. She went to England for three years. Her English name is Louie, and she has a Chinese name, Liu Shi, because she rarely admires Chinese ancient poetry. Her father was a government official, Lieutenant Colonel Nakamura, who served as the First Secretary of the British Embassy six years ago for four years. They have one son and one daughter; the son is also a government official, currently serving in Hiroshima, a lieutenant instructor and staff officer of the regimental headquarters." "Little Line" is a code name in the Hejian Group, equivalent to informants.</p>
<p>"Very good! Pingzi, Louie, Liu Shi,...! She can sing, no wonder her voice is so pleasing to the ear; when she speaks, it's as crisp as the steel pipes in a symphony orchestra tinkling... But do you have any information about her activities?"</p>
<p>"Right now, she is probably a special member of the Black Dragon Society...! But I can't be sure." Special members are not subject to five-level testing, but their relatives must have had historical ties with the society.</p>
<p>"That's right...! Thank you for your hard work. There are six friends waiting for us outside. I can't handle them myself. I've already instructed 十二　to come and take care of them on the phone. You park the car in a convenient location, I might have to leave soon."</p>
<p>Hejian re-entered the dance floor, and the music was playing "Guan Shan Night Moon," which swept the entire Three Islands, a three-part song that explained a young love affair from "Lover in a Dream" to "Suicide Pact". The melody was soft and serene, soul-stirring, and was also an imitation of a Western waltz, but with a very strong Japanese flavor. The lighting in the entire venue was more gentle than the tango just now.</p>

<h3>Postage</h3>
<p>— By Shaofu</p>
<p>The publishing industry has never had good days. I wonder if those who criticize the poverty of the Chinese publishing industry have deeply understood the difficulties and hardships involved. It is really a big question.</p>
<p>Printing costs are a heavy burden that makes publishers breathless. May I ask if the fees for two thousand words can barely cover the typesetting costs for one thousand words? Selling knowledge is so cheap. We really must cry out in unison, "Civilization has been swept away." Fortunately, paper prices are not yet expensive, allowing everyone to relax a little. However, at this very moment, postage has soared, suddenly increasing fourfold. This is too big of a blow to the entire publishing industry.</p>
<p>An ordinary magazine, priced at eight hundred yuan, would cost the same amount to mail from Shanghai to Beijing or Xi'an by air. How can readers bear such a burden! Some people say, why send it by air? The answer is very simple. Leaving aside many places that can only be reached by air, even if there are other means of transportation, with the post office's mountain of accumulated packages and various obstacles on land and water routes, it may take two months to travel from Shanghai to Xi'an. May I ask, what reason do readers in Xi'an have to read a magazine from two months ago? If it is a daily newspaper, it is even worse!</p>
<p>This blow is tantamount to strangling the circulation of culture. For the sake of popularizing knowledge, we should appeal to the authorities and request special treatment for publications. Publications should be an exception to this postage increase.</p>
<h3>The Achievements of Lazy People</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jia Jing</p>
<p>(Editor's note: The article below only illustrates a human psychology of seeking convenience and progress, which is obviously different from true laziness like "parasitic plants". True laziness is anti-progressive!)</p>
<p>First of all, let me declare: I am not a person who advocates laziness. Since we were young, we have been accustomed to hearing our elders tell us stories of lazy people. They all believe that laziness is despicable and believe that lazy people will never develop. However, the following article says that most of the evolution of mankind depends on lazy people. This is a wonderful argument. I would like to present it to readers:</p>
<p>(1) It is an obvious fact that women's youth always fades earlier than men's. Undoubtedly, this is because women in ordinary social classes are more industrious than their husbands. They are willing to do habitual labor instead of intellectual ease.</p>
<p>(2) In restaurants, lazy waiters are often the most satisfactory. They bring out everything the customer needs at once, saving the customer from having to call them repeatedly. Diligent waiters sometimes bring coffee but forget the sugar or forget the spoon. They would rather run back and forth, and by the time everything is complete, the coffee is cold!</p>
<p>Human evolution</p>
<p>(3) The evolution of mankind has almost all been successfully planned by lazy people in order to save a certain step. In ancient times, humans lived in caves. When they were thirsty, they had to walk a long way to find spring water to drink. However, lazier people came up with a way to bring a large amount of water home in buckets. Later, they used bamboo pipes to connect the spring to their homes. Later, they invented water pumps.</p>
<p>More than a hundred years ago, a boy named Humphrey Potter was hired to sit next to a steam engine and manage the exhaust gas discharged by each stroke. Later, after a long time, he became bored with the work, so he used ropes and doors to connect, so that the valve would open and close automatically. Not only was it less labor-intensive, but the work efficiency increased by more than double. From his laziness, he unintentionally invented the principle of the reciprocating valve.</p>
<p>(4) Great engineer and life guidance expert E.B. GilPrath often loved to screen films of skilled workers in various professional departments to determine how many movements were required to complete a job. He found that lazy workers do not waste a single simple movement, while diligent workers do not pay attention to wasting many unnecessary movements. As a result, lazy workers are more efficient than diligent workers.</p>
<p>(5) Lazy people never waste precious time dreaming about the dynamics of daily life. They often sit there quietly waiting for a more intelligent idea to come.</p>
<p>The best books are mostly products of lazy writers. If the writer is too diligent, he will eagerly desire the completion of the work day and night, and he will always feel that there are too many unsatisfactory places, so he must revise it again and again! He always hopes for excellent sentence patterns and excellent plots to appear.</p>
<p>I am not alone</p>
<p>(6) Intellectual laziness also benefits in the same way. Many proverbs and formulas are set by lazy people to replace their brains. If there were no law of falling bodies, how could we determine when an apple falls from a tree and two small balls, one thrown straight up and the other thrown later, will meet?</p>
<p>Lazy people say: "I am not alone!"</p>
<h3>One House on Fire, Ten Thousand Suffer</h3>
<p>— By Suobei</p>
<p>One house on fire, ten thousand suffer; fire-fighting equipment must be strengthened; strengthening equipment is not a fundamental solution; fire prevention campaign must be publicized! Bending the chimney and moving the firewood is the smartest; burning your head and scorching your forehead is futile! All Shanghai citizens should pay attention to preventing arson in dry and windy weather!</p>
<h3>Suicide</h3>
<p>— By Jinlu</p>
<p>According to statistics released by the police department's statistical office, a total of 839 suicide cases have occurred in this city from January to 卞 month of this year. Women accounted for 491, and men 348. Family disputes were the most common cause of suicide. In terms of educational level of suicide victims, those with primary education and those who were illiterate ranked first.</p>
<p>Looking at the above table analysis statistics, we can estimate that an average of five and a half people commit suicide every two days in this city. We can also find a trend in it, that is, the higher the level of education, the less suicide tricks are played. What is most noteworthy is the cause of suicide: family disputes rank first; and women are more likely than men. "It is difficult for an honest official to judge family affairs." In our country in this transitional period, which is not old or new, family disputes are indeed a difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>Now, let me make a realistic analysis of the causes of family disputes: the first is "no money". It is indeed not easy to live in this society where the weak are prey to the strong, there is little rice and many sacrifices, and everyone is fighting for food. Businesses that make money are not necessarily difficult, but businesses that are difficult are not necessarily profitable. At this time of rising prices, once the husband loses his job, "husband and wife" cannot escape "firewood and rice", and "love" cannot be eaten as "food". For the sake of firewood and rice, quarrels between husband and wife arise from time to time, and tragedy takes root at this time. The second is "too much money". Some men can be the best husbands in the world when they have no money, but once they have some stinky money, they are like runaway horses, spending time and drinking outside, throwing dice and shouting, and throwing the long-suffering wife out of the sky. When the wife is angry and cannot find a way for her husband to make money again, tragedy occurs.</p>
<p>The above two reasons are analyzed based on the fact that most of the suicide victims are engaged in family services and are unemployed. The reasons are one and two, two and one, coming and going, it is still for the sake of money. To be honest, most of the disputes in the family are caused by this "Adu object".</p>
<p>But the problem is not with money itself. In a word: it depends on how you handle money!</p>

<h3>Post Talk: Who Doesn't Need Stamps Who Invented Stamps</h3>
<p>— By Kong Zhen</p>
<p>In this world, who can avoid contact with relatives and friends except Robinson Crusoe! So, doesn't the transmission of letters depend on that small stamp? In other words, everyone needs stamps except Robinson Crusoe.</p>
<p>The value of stamps has been determined, and they are indispensable in our daily lives; so it is worth studying.</p>
<p>Story</p>
<p>There are many legends about the origin of stamps: one is said to be the most reliable and a very "romantic" story; in England there was a girl who was extremely beautiful, so many people pursued her, and she received many love letters from all over the world every day. At that time, the postage was paid by the recipient. She received too many boring letters of this kind, and she couldn't afford it; so she began to refuse to receive letters. Suddenly, the post office (maybe it had another name) was in trouble; later, they changed their method to have the sender pay the postage.</p>
<p>The shape of the stamps is not fixed, long, square, round, triangular, as long as you can think of it. The colors are even more colorful. If you have time to casually visit that stamp company, it is always "a dazzling array".</p>
<p>Our Chinese stamps are relatively monotonous. Except for the long ones, they are square, and almost all of them are printed with the posthumous portrait of the Founding Father.</p>
<p>Function</p>
<p>Stamps also have a major function, which is commemorative stamps. Issuing a special stamp to commemorate someone or something has great significance both in practice and in appearance. Like the two sets of commemorative stamps we have recently seen, celebrating President Jiang's birthday and celebrating the opening of the National Assembly. Commemorative stamps are issued even more in other countries. Many countries have printed commemorative stamps of US President Roosevelt. Isn't this another function of promoting diplomatic relations?</p>
<p>San Marino, a small country in Italy, is even more interesting: one of the main sources of income for their country is issuing various commemorative stamps. Before our postage increase this time, it was said that the post office was losing money badly. I don't understand why it wouldn't print two sets of commemorative stamps. Could it be said that that would be detrimental to the demeanor of a great power? The reason why issuing commemorative stamps has become a source of income is due to the purchase of stamp collectors.</p>
<p>Stamps that violate the law are more valuable, commemorative stamps issued before the Northern Expedition by Zhang Zuolin, who called himself the Grand Marshal of the Navy and Army, stamps issued by the Communist Party before the war, and stamps from the enemy puppet era "returning the capital", "air defense", etc. are all valuable.</p>
<p>Stamp collecting</p>
<p>The hobby of stamp collecting is quite common in the world and in China. It is not only an art, but also a course in history and geography. Close your eyes and think about it. A hundred years later, a child holds a set of commemorative stamps for President Jiang's sixtieth birthday. Doesn't he have an impression of such a great man in his mind? Isn't it more effective than his books?</p>
<h3>No Smoking</h3>
<p>— By Cai Lin</p>
<p>The walls of movie theaters, theaters, and stages are all posted with six conspicuous characters "Prohibition of Smoking".</p>
<p>This is probably still useless, so "Instructions" are printed with "Prohibition of Smoking" again.</p>
<p>Before the movie starts, a warning "Prohibition of Smoking" is also projected on the screen.</p>
<p>These, when 伊　介 case, smoking freely, still enjoying themselves狂 sucking.</p>
<p>Because the windows in the movie theater are tightly closed and the air does not circulate, the smoke cannot dissipate, and the strong smell makes non-smokers suffer from headaches and dizziness.</p>
<p>This group of people who destroy the "Prohibition of Smoking" are all intellectuals, and they all have a good "appearance", because they rely on their "good appearance" to have this "courage".</p>
<p>As a result, many gazes that dare to be angry but dare not speak are constantly focused on this smoker, implying "Swine! Don't you know how to read..."</p>
<p>Without even this basic sense of "public morality", how can China not be a mess? Understated</p>
<h3>Six Roots Not Clean</h3>
<p>— By Xiaoseng</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple is a famous temple at sea, and precisely because it is a "famous temple", after De Wu and Mi Jia were reported, "Six Roots" invited dozens of Dharma protectors and benefactors to sign a petition and return to the temple. The Buddhist sect has many affairs, which really makes people feel "six roots not clean"!</p>
<h3>Is there a legacy of evil</h3>
<p>— By Ye Cao</p>
<p>The power saving campaign has entered a serious stage, and all households have received the "ultimatum" book of "disconnection if the limit is violated"; therefore, there is a wave of complaints, and everyone says: "What is the difference between this and the era of enemy puppet rule?" "Enemy puppet politics" is actually used as a "balance" to compare with reality. I wonder if this is what we often call "legacy of evil?"</p>
<h3>Sighing Sound</h3>
<p>— By Sui</p>
<p>On the day of Yu Qia's coffin, two "Bai Xiang" type strong men sighed incessantly on the side of the road. One said: "When he came to Shanghai, he was about the same as us, only four horns of foreign money", and the other pointed to the ceremonial pavilion and said "People rely on these two words to get out!" The pavilion inside is the word "Qincheng", this scene can be written into a novel.</p>
<h3>Treatment Issues?</h3>
<p>— By Ye Cao</p>
<p>Jiangwan police officer Shi Gongwei was detained and fined for privately accepting a bribe of 50,000 yuan from a smoker. The implementation of the prohibition policy has been several months, but the atmosphere of poison has not subsided slightly. The reason for this is only this. For all government orders that cannot be completed from beginning to end, we can all view them in this way. I heard that the adjustment of police officer treatment has been approved by the authorities, and we hope that it will not become a rumor.</p>

<h3>Sanmao</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Leping</p>
<p>News Personality</p>
<h3>Leader of the Democratic Socialist Party: Zhang Junmai</h3>
<p>— Mi Shan</p>
<p>Currently, Zhang Junmai is clearly a news figure attracting attention from all sides.</p>
<p>A few days ago, whether the Democratic Socialist Party under Zhang's leadership would participate in the National Assembly became the focus of general discussion and speculation. However, the "mystery" has finally been revealed. The Democratic Socialist Party ultimately nominated candidates to participate in the National Assembly. This naturally disappointed the Yan'an side.</p>
<p>Zhang's given name is Jiasen, Junmai is his courtesy name. He is the elder brother of the current Minister of Railways, Zhang Jia'ao. He is probably sixty years old this year. His ancestral home is Baoshan County, Jiangsu. He graduated from the Department of Political Science at Waseda University in Japan in 1909 and served as a compiler in the former Qing Dynasty Hanlin Academy. During the revolution, he served as the editor-in-chief of the Tianjin Jingjin Times. After the founding of the Republic of China, he served as a secretary in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Later, he went to England and Germany to specialize in political science. After returning to China, he served as a Zhejiang negotiator for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Later, he resigned and came to Shanghai to serve as the general manager of the Shishi Xinbao newspaper. After that, he devoted himself to education, serving as the president of National Chengchi University and a professor at Soochow, Aurora, and Yenching Universities.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang has made great contributions to the academic world. What is most unforgettable is that he made a big splash in the early years in the debate on "Women's Studies and Science." His more famous works include "A Record of the Social Democratic Political Situation in the New Germany" and "Draft for the Chinese Constitution."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang founded his party in 1931, launching preparations for the "National Socialist Party." In 1932, he published the party platform, and in 1934 and 1936, he convened two representative congresses. Mr. Zhang was the general secretary of the party and fully responsible. His position is: on the one hand, he does not agree with the theory of "national supremacy," but he also believes that the state has its own importance; on the other hand, he is deeply afraid that the government representing the state will repeat the drawbacks of Western capitalist countries, so he advocates the development of socialism in order to avoid class struggle. For more than ten years, Mr. Zhang has appeared on the Chinese political stage as the leader of the party, and he has also made efforts on the anti-Japanese front.</p>
<p>Last November, Mr. Zhang went to the United States, where he held preliminary consultations with overseas democratic constitutional parties in Montreal. As a result, because "we are like-minded and have obtained the consent of both parents," they announced their union, resulting in the current Democratic Socialist Party, whose purpose is "to achieve socialism by democratic methods."</p>
<p>From journalist to scholar, from scholar to politician, these are the three stages of Zhang Junmai's life.</p>
