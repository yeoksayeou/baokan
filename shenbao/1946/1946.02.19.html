<p>〔本報重慶十八日電〕傳聞蘇聯對東北問題提出新要求一點，各方迄未證實，惟日前王世杰之匆促赴京，但云請示要公，不無惹人注目。聞哈爾濱市長楊綽庵自接收哈爾濱以後，處境備極困難，其他各處接收人員境遇相同，生命保障，均須仰賴盟暈，談不上治安與行政。又悉，中宣部駐東北特派員潘公弼，將於日內返渝述職。</p>

<p>〔合衆社北平十八日電〕遼北省政府官員十人，前往東北南部，接收該省所轄鄉區內之十縣，約定以相等數目之蘇方聯絡官偕同前往，經與蘇方接觸時，發現彼等僅有五人之數，華方接收人員之中，祇得別出五人。嗣後蘇方發覺華方五接收人員內，一人係來自北平，一人係東北當地之人，乃控指彼等並非重慶直接派出之接收人員，拒絕與之偕行。所餘三人，乃整裝待發，詎料蘇方又謂，其中一人似有病態，一人似「無充分之地理智識」，又拒絕啓程，結果華方遂祇有獨人前往接收地區，但　渠到達縣城時，不得其門而入，此人現寄寓於火車站，即在該處執行接收工作，據中國報紙載稱：「並不十分方便」。</p>
<h3>張莘夫慘案發生後　輿論喚起民衆注意</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶十八日電〕關於東北問題，自張莘夫慘案發生以後，社會輿論漸感不安，大公報今日社論，對共產黨發言人最近發表解決東北問題之主張，認為此非內政問題，並對中央軍進駐東北遭受種種困難，被共產黨軍在外力協助下（新華日報社論自認係得蘇軍協助），竟得大量流入東北各地，認爲中蘇友好條約相違，其他各報亦多就柬北問題著論，喚起民衆注意。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十八日電〕重慶報紙對於東北再起衝突，大爲震動，並指責蘇聯，指中蘇條約爲毫無意義，並對雅爾達秘密協定表示遺憾，同時各報對蘇聯在東北之活動，嚴加批評。</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺十八日電〕此間華僑代表今日開會，通過次議案，要求東九省蘇軍立即撤退，以保護中國領土及主權。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十八日電〕此間官方討論東北國共又起衝突及蘇聯經濟要求聲中，國軍開往關外者，聞將有八師之衆。除第五軍及新六軍已開往外，尚有新一軍·第八軍·第七十四軍·第九十四軍及其他二軍已整裝待發。</p>
<h3>徐州人口激增</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十八日電〕據徐州市警局統計，徐州人口激增，較戰前超出近二倍，上月份普查實數凡二六六，七八四名，此係普通戶口數目，其公共處所外僑寺廟戶口尚不在內，按戰前徐州人口不足十一萬人。</p>
<h3>關外初春</h3>
<p>— 榮欽</p>
<p>立春已四天了，在廣州，在昆叫，那落寞寞枯荒的原野，該點綴着嫩芽綠葉了。江南的春光，好些人在憬憧着，摹擬着，在關外，冰塊，雪氈，依然沒有溶解的徵象，立春之日，這裏白雪　紛，從南方來的人們，口邊整天掛着個「冷」字，看到穿着黑棉衣，戴皮帽的孩子們在玩雪溜冰，有點自愧不如。老人在說：「今年好多了，在年還要冷」。氣候，今年的也許種往年的一樣，可是她（他）們的心坎裏，却有　　的感覺。</p>
<p>匪患處虛，煤斤缺少，生活的擔子在咄咄逼人，關外同胞那溫暖的心坎衷老有物在作梗。「X路匪」，「大X子」一類的各詞，始終沒有從同胞們的口角消逝。鬍子，好些地方有，而且很兇，可是，「X路」二字之下，添上個「匪」字，却使人們的心頭蒙上陰影。同　　在說：X路軍到來之初還好，稱呼老百姓做「大哥」「大嫂」或「同志」，可是由於缺乏甚至沒有裝備和糧食，就常攫取老百姓的東西。人家或學校中的桌精和木料，很多被拿去燒飯或取暖，住在老百姓家，糧食益增其困難。國軍進駐前夕，他們還焚燬了不少老百姓的糧食，以免炎「敵」云云。實際上，新六軍利五十二軍，都自備有充足的食糧，他們重宣傳，每到一地就把「朱德通電」重播一番，老百姓知這領導抗戰的是「蔣主席」，對他們的演講，沒有多少人聽入可。要是當地有學校的話，他們還倡組「學聯」和「敎聯」（敎職員聯合會），「我敢說，這裏的知識份子沒有一個加入他們的黨，以有一些」流氓加入了」，一位從事敎育三十年的中學校長，這樣告訴記者。</p>
<p>聽說在新民南北，「X路軍」在拉夫嶔馬，强使操練：「民衆武力」在東牝看着又要加强了。</p>
<p>出關的國軍，大部還在瀋陽市郊和或三三兩兩進城遊玩，可是不准帶武器，晚上也不准逗留，聞係談判未妥之故。瀋陽中蘇軍聯歡的消息，使這裏的國軍臉上帶着愉快的光彩。</p>
<p>黃金價格此關內高不了多少，有時還要低些，使黃物累累的人們感到不快。</p>
<p>敎育的重建，該是重建東北的一個主題，敵偽十四年的統治，推行的是不折不扣的奴化敎育，魔黨的降臨，敎育的變化最大，初小，硬給改稱國民學校，高小改稱國民優級學校，大學仍稱大學，也許是因爲受敎育的大多是日人或鮮人之故，各級學校都有日人在主持，監督。任副校長的日人，心目中沒有校長，最使人心駭的，是課程內容的臉相，各級學校主要的課程是「國語」（日語和和「滿」語，所謂「滿」語就是漢語）。「建國精神」和「藝能」（乃勞動服務如種田，耕地之類），以日語及「滿語」合稱「國語」，其用心可見。課程雖然是如此，可是家長們還惟恐自己的子弟不能入學，好些人還用說情甚至賄賂來達到送子弟入學的目的。因爲讓孩子們留在家裏，對「國家」的責任尤重，孩子們入學，念書時問少，勞役時間多。國民優級學校（高小）畢業，而能寫淸楚姓名和寫封最簡單的信的，已算成績優良了。奴化敎育還及於吃飯和穿衣，如在大學中，日籍學生吃大米「即白米」，「滿」籍學生却吃高梁，有餐把小米吃，已屬萬幸。各級學校敎職員的待遇也不同，以國民高等學校（中學）而論，「滿」籍敎師月入百五，日籍的却月入二百，得到的配給品，後者也較前者優厚多多。「滿」籍敎師有時以寒酸難耐，想做件把新衣，也不敢輕於嘗試。「經濟犯」的罪名是吃不消的。</p>
<p>實際上，奴化敎育的成效，幷沒有日人意願中的那麼大，各級學校的日籍敎員，對思想的監視雖十分嚴密，日本憲兵還不時闖進校門，盤問或拘捕「思想嫌疑犯」，可是以「反滿抗日」罪而繫獄而犧牲的員生，還是層見疊出。爲東北同胞所樂道的，還是民廿九的一幕，是年「汪記」政府演完了「還都」的趣劇以後，在長春舉行所謂「日滿支」球賽聯賽，「支」隊射進了球，「滿」隊代表和觀衆就報以熟烈的掌聲，「滿」隊射進了球，也得到同樣熱烈的掌聲，至日隊射進了球，全場却鴉鵲無聲，瑟縮地要鼓掌的一些日僑觀衆，也不好意思鼓掌了，日當局爲之快然不樂。</p>
<p>不過，話又得說回來，東北敎育，究竟得重建，而且非常迫切，十四年來，這里年靑的一代，是在無聲地受着「敎育」！孩子們沒有運用腦筋的機會，他們得重新享受到自由地思想的幸福。已退出學校門牆的「黨化敎育」，也不必植移此問，實際上，這衷的年靑人幷不愛聽「黨」，他們却熱愛着社國—那離開這麼久的母親！</p>
<p>記者草此文時，遼寗全省的中學校長和敎員，已到錦外去集中，受兩週的訓練，小學敎師也將于月之十二日起受訓，他們的腦子是該多灌入「祖國」的意識和新的世界觀。師資在這裏非常缺乏，靑黃不接的現階段，當局多仍用舊人，舊人不一定不好，可是有資格的師資，這裏確是十分需要！（二月八日于新民）</p>
<h3>周恩來對東北衝突　主張由軍事調處</h3>
<p>稱共黨不反對中央軍開入東北</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十八日電〕周恩來今日對東北蘇軍遲遲其行有所表示，並否中國共產黨為「莫科之爪牙」，提周氏稱：「蘇聯軍隊愈早退出東北愈妙」。中共並不公開要求蘇聯撇兵，以免國人猜疑中共有接收統治東北野心。中共並不反對中央軍開入東北恢復主權，惟關外已有共軍及共黨控制之軍隊三十萬人，大半駐在遼·吉兩省，如遭攻擊，「定必發生事故」。周氏並謂：共產黨贊成馬歇爾特使主張，在東北最近發生衝突之處，派遣軍事調處小組前往，惟中央方面迄未答復。</p>
<p>〔路透社重慶十八日電〕此間中共發言人今日聲稱：中央政府軍與中共軍在東九省有時斷時續之衝突，然中國全境政府與中共兩軍之停戰協議，則予保守云。此間數報今日稱，東北局勢「危急」，大公報要求停止「秘密外交」及對東北局勢之新聞封鎖。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十八日電〕自國共衝突消息繼續傳出後，此間人士對於東北局勢益增憂慮，國軍在過去十日間自東北九省西南部之鐵路地區向外擴展，同時美海軍繼續自中國各地運送軍隊至東北。據共產黨報告稱：杜聿明部下之國軍繼續向「人民軍」推進，戰事已自遼寗西部蔓延至熱河東部，新六軍於佔據盤山及台安後，復進佔遼中。據此間著名東北籍教育家周鯨文敎授告合衆社記者稱：在經濟破產之東北，現有國籍不同政黨各異之軍隊約一百萬人，內包括蘇聯軍，蒙古軍，蘇聯國際共產軍，中共軍，國軍，前僞滿傭兵，及前抗日義勇軍等。蘇軍確數若干，無人知之，但估計當在十萬人左右。蘇聯國際共產軍包括蘇聯，中國，日本，蒙古及朝鮮人民，的計十五萬人。國軍包括三軍，至多十二萬人，支援東蒙自治政府之蒙古騎兵的有三萬人。中共軍隊佔有南滿，蘇聯國際共產軍佔有北滿，以通過長春之綫作爲界綫，蒙古人居住於東北西部王爺廟附近，偽滿傭兵及抗日義勇軍則散佈東北各地。</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫敦十七日電〕聯合國機構美國首席代表史退汀紐斯，今日於搭機返美時談稱：聯合國機構之永久會地址設於美國，「其前途遠較吾人所敢希望者為光明」。史氏對於英國使聯合國機構首次大會圓滿結束之努力，致其敬意。渠稱：美國代表團全體人員於離英返國之際，對於英國政府及人民，表示最熟誠之欽佩。「新大陸之舊金山爲聯合國憲章之誕生地，舊大陸之倫敦則爲聯合國復興世界維持和平機構之誕生地，前後輝映，相得益彰也」。</p>

<h3>原子秘密洩漏案　搜查已擴至英國　倫敦已有一加拿大官員被捕　美參議員主張立即進行調查</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十八日電〕據渥太華消息，關於加拿大軍官數人因洩漏原子彈秘密嫌疑被捕小，政府將於三日發表聲明。同　該案調查委員會，本日赤召開　密會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐的十八日電〕華盛頓電：加拿大於上週末開始逮捕洩漏機密情報之間諜以來，美國　議院外交委員會已被要求調查美國境內之局勢。共和黨參議員勃里傑在紐的前驅論壇報發表談　稱：此乃具有可怖勢力之事件。參院外交委員會應即進行調查，俾知國務院內是否有人阻止聯邦調查局或司法部之澈查此事。前驅論壇報復載有前美國駐華大使赫爾利之談話，樂謂：加拿大之事件，與渠去年十二月向參院外交姿員會提供之情報有關。皮兩森氏亦爲紐的星期日鏡報撰文，內稱：加拿大金總理驚人之宣佈，使國務院處於極窘之地位，小知我國務院亦擬進行澈查否？金總理於下令搜捕嫌疑犯以前，會徵求我國務院之意見，希望。　兩國政府同時進行，然貝爾納　國務　則予拒絕，貝爾納斯於去年九月在倫敦參加五强外長會議時，即知蘇聯有在美洲佈置間諜網之事，常時使其大爲忿怒，遂與莫洛托夫引起不歐云。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十八日電〕此間陸軍專家對於嚴密防範之原于彈秘密竟「屢次洩漏」，表示嚴重關切，調秘密洩漏，實危及美國之最優勢地位，對於現已被一般獲得之極重要情報，並無充分之法律上保護。美國原子彈計劃主任葛羅夫斯少將謂：美國於過去四週來所失去關於此彈之安全，較諸戰時整個發明時期所失者爲多。</p>
<h3>運蘇供應品　加下令停止生產</h3>
<p>合衆社渥太華十八日電〕加拿大政府已停止生產準備運往蘇聯之供應品。此項消息，係自某可靠方面人士傳出，渠稱：停止生產之命令，係由建設部長霍維所頒發，而於數日前生效，但繼即指出，此項停止生產令與洩漏原子秘密事無關，而「純屬偶然之巧合」。該可靠方面人士謂：取消此項生產之唯一原因，爲加拿大與蘇聯在放欵條件方面未能談妥，但仍有人以爲外國政府特務人員之間牒活動，乃加拿大採取此項行動之一種因素。</p>
<h3>有關雷達之　二種新發明</h3>
<p>美陸軍部已予披露</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十七日電〕陸軍部巳解除戰時信號隊有關雷達二種新發明之禁令，此項發明可以測出長距離上之敵方臼砲與大砲陣地，且能測知在敵人盤據下之公路，夜間隊伍與車輛調動情形。陸軍信號隊司令尹格拉斯中將，說明雷達偵察器能以驚人之準確程度，搜索距離五英里以外之敵方砲位，信號隊利用一特製雷達，測出敵方砲彈之上下進行方向，然後　幾何三角測量原理算出砲彈全部彈道，及砲位之準確地點。根據上述方法，雷達可發現五英里以外之隱蔽砲位，其差誤最多爲六十碼。用以窺測敵人夜間調動情形之雷達，雖於雷達電彼四佈之區域中，亦能測出所有移動之目標，則遠在十六英里以外之車輛，亦難逃出其視綫。然普通有效距離爲十英里，三英里外部隊之移動亦可察覺，雷達技師技巧之熟練，竟能計算一隊中之敵兵人數，及敵人車輛之類型與速度。</p>

<h3>英方決取堅強行動　維持新加坡秩序</h3>
<p>最近衝突事件調查結果　認警察槍為完全合法</p>

<p>華文報紙論調一斑</p>
<p>〔聯合社新坡十七日電〕自衝突事件後，各華文報調美國不忘珍珠港事件，英國何以主張不應紀念新加坡陷落，保守派星洲日報亦認耙念爲正當，謂此日乃日軍佔領區內人民受難之日，理應紀念，以示世界各國決不容再見法西斯主義之決心，並指斥英國以恐嚇手段，對付手無軍器之平民。</p>

<h3>蘇聯外交突轉向　支持義國反要求　企圖在地中海擴展勢力　義境波軍司令駁斥蘇方讕言</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十七日電〕倫敦星期快報載莫斯科特派員報吿稱：蘇聯已停止支持南斯拉夫對於特里埃斯特之要求，將轉而支持義大利之反要求。聯合國機構蘇首席代表維辛斯基星期四與義外交代表卡蘭狄尼伯爵在倫敎作私人會晤，據稱，維辛斯基曾謂「蘇聯政府永不忘懷義大利爲首先向蘇聯表示友好之國家。」該報猜測蘇聯支持義大利之動機有二：一爲分離義大利傾向西方之趨勢，二爲擴充蘇聯在地中海之潛勢力至南斯拉夫現時疆界以外。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬十八日電〕義大利和的之談判間題恢復以後，特里埃斯特港及茹里安區城之糾紛事件，似已引起國內外態度之轉變。南斯拉夫共黨宣傳以特港併入南斯拉夫聯邦，近已趨向緩和，同時義共黨亦逐漸附和其他義政黨，力言特港在性質上之屬於義大利。</p>

<h3>日民衆以現鈔　爭換物資</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十八日專電〕日政府緊急金融食物管制令，使週杪市場與商店區，買風大起，盈千累萬之民衆，羣集於東京商業區，各欲以其錢瞥換取食物與商品，雖週杪米價尚屬穩定，然日用品之售價則扶搖直上。日幣十元以下之小票面鈔渠，可不受新鈔發行之影響，故小粟面之鈔票，人爭欲得之。記者曾見一日人持十元票，向鐵路局售票處購取其非必要之一角車票，顧客入店，輒先問有無小票面之鈔票找出，以致東京各處商店皆貼出通吿，請買客勿作找出小票之希望。據觀察家意見，此種紛擾乃暫時性質，三月七日以前物價勢必上漲，惟在三月七日以後物價將逐步趨低，因屆時舊幣將廢棄不用，而銀行提欵亦受限制也。</p>
<h3>日本地位消失　美貿易將改觀</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十七日電〕商務部本日宣稱：日本主要輸出國之地位消失後，勢必刺激遠東其他各國之工業化，因而對於美國之對外貿易，將發生重大影響。戰前美國對遠東之全部輸出，百分之五十五以上爲上本所購買，而在遠東對美之輸出中，日本的佔六分之一。由戰後國際貿易情况改觀之觀點而言，尤為重要，蓋日本原爲亞洲市場需要廉價貨物之主要供應者。</p>

<p>〔路透社德黑蘭十八日電〕蘇聯巨型運輸機一架，將於今日載伊朗總理沙丹納及其所選之代表，離德黑闌逕飛莫斯科，作改進兩國關係之談判，惟亞塞爾拜鐵問題，是否在談判範圍以內，尚屬可疑，許多人士相信，俄方當拒談此事，沙丹泰納總理昨向國會致辭，允許揭開對蘇關係新的一頁時，全場歡呼不已，迨沙氏離議會時，羣衆又特其高舉肩頭，此等現象，均可表示人民對於新政府之擁護。</p>

<h3>雅爾達協定　犧牲我基本權利</h3>
<p>美各報一致嚴詞抨擊　均認蘇聯之慾壑難塡</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山十七日電〕美國報紙今日就雅爾達協定將千島羣鳥及庫頁島南部割讓蘇聯一事，發表評論，咸同意紐的時報所稱：「爲戰時强權政治所造成之不幸結果，勢屬無可避免」。若干報紙對於邱吉爾及罷斯福，不與中國商酌，逕准許蘇聯在東九省有種種權利，嚴詞識評。</p>
<p>紐約時報稱：此協定中最不幸者，即英美同意犧牲另一盟邦中國之基本權利，然後由美國總統以旣成事實徵求中國同意。在聯合國進攻日本本土之前，即使紅軍不參加作戰，日本已有求和跡象，但在雅爾達協定簽訂之時，則日本軍事上之弱點，及不俟被殲即願求和之意，固尙未如是明顯云。</p>
<p>波特闌之奧勒岡日報力陳千島羣島在戰略上之重要，故聞羅斯福及邱吉爾已將此島議與蘇聯後，一般人均爲之「震驚」。美國在太平洋利益，及美國所主張之廣泛托管制度，均因此蒙受影響，共經二次大戰之與國，務必坦直相見，此即在蘇聯，亦屬首要，千島羣島一事實應由聯合國機構重加審查云。</p>
<p>舊金山紀事報稱：由雅爾達協定字襄行間，顯然可知羅斯福及邱吉爾以相當代價換得蘇联之協助，此代價即千島羣島，及其他重要讓步，尤其是涉及中國部分者，此協定經三巨頭商定簽字，並未向中國　蔣主席透露，而中國爲因此協定蒙受損失之唯一國家，由此可見在三巨頭心目中，從無四强一念，四强云云者，僅爲轉移公衆視聽之口號而已。</p>
<p>奧勒岡報又稱：「千島羣島中若干島嶼，原屬日本領土，歷史已久，並不能歸屬於藉暴力與貪慾所取得之土地」。如一九四三年羅邱蔣開羅會議所宣布而應向日本割取者，可知雅爾達協定有政治關係，亦有軍事關係。</p>
<p>華盛頓時報評論，題曰：「穌聯已取得代價而猶未饜足「。內稱：秘密協定中對蘇聯之每一諾言，現均已實行，但在倫敦聯合國會議中，可見蘇聯仍不以旣得者爲滿足，對於任何政府之願望，凡不聽命於莫斯科者，仍堅決予以反對。</p>

<h3>最複雜最錯綜萬族大熔爐　夏威夷鑄新血統　中太平洋自由天堂巡禮</h3>
<p>……本報編譯室特譯稿</p>
<p>美國一向是全世界的第一號種族溶治爐，可是今日之下，她的屬地夏威夷島，已靑出於藍而勝於藍，把她打倒了。夏威夷初次被發現時，全島人口共有三十萬人，都是島上的原始居民。此後地球上各處角落都有人去，商人，工人，冒險家，各式俱全，造成了這中太平洋的天堂！現佔島民中最多數的，是中國人，日本人，葡萄牙人，和西班牙人。事實上，夏威夷的居民，幾乎可代表全球的人種。</p>
<h3>白人稱「好些」　中國人稱「伯蓋」</h3>
<p>最近，美國水手離開檀香山的時候，他們這一羣中間發生了一片喧嘩咀咒之聲，他們拿橫逆乘戾的語調形容夏威夷島的島民說：「天曉得！這些愚蠶的，赤脚的，　　的檀香山的島民們！」這些咒誼，祇不過）顯出檀香山在一小部份人腦筋中微小的失敗面。實則它幾乎可成爲全世界混血雜種最成功的實騐地，和社會學家混合種文敎的夢想境界呢。在夏威夷，種族有那麼許多，純血種，混血種，各色俱全。那一種優待，那一種岐視，根本沒有差別。每一種都是少數民族。夏歲夷的四十三萬人口中，有美國人，英國人，挪威人，德國人，西班牙人，普多黎剛種人，葡萄牙人，黑人，中國人，韓國人日本人，菲律濱人，米克洛尼西亞種人，下里尼西亞種人。此外，還有上面那些種族的混合結晶品。在那裏，人們拿才德去鑒別一個人，並不拿　色去判斷，好像和夏威夷土人的鑑別方法一樣。那裏的白人，不叫做白人，而稱爲「好來些」，（譯音）意思是外來的人。中國人稱爲「伯蓋」，即「伯伯」的意思。夏威夷士人本來不會讀R，現在己經學會了，因爲英文已變做最普遍的言語。</p>
<h3>精神趨向美國化　雜種成份不隠瞞</h3>
<p>這隻溶冶鑪內，寬容混血和種族博愛的情形，在今日，眞是世無其匹！但也並非沒有它例外的地方。高級白種人，對於混血不大寬容，他們多少保持着靂色的界限綫，這是認爲不好的一種能度，可是，這些人可說是夏威夷島上的例外人物，事實上，一個新的血種芷在成長中。</p>
<p>夏威夷的新混血種，旣有寬容耐性，又健康，又美國化，在那裏，沒有一個人會隱瞞他的雜種成份。事實上，如果要聲請一張結婚證書，必須要說明四個祖父母的種族血統。美國官方戶籍局，祗登記兩個血種，那便是高加索夏威夷和亞洲夏威夷兩種。除此之外，不管祖上血統的如何複雜，聲請人一律依他或她父親的種族，或本身所屬的種族集團去登記。雖然「白色」和「有色」等字眼從來不用，皮色淡些的終更受愛好些。有些半雜種夏威夷人，爲避免人家議笑他誇張白種血統成份濃厚起見，往往作爲純夏威夷種登記。中國夏戚夷人和高加索夏威夷人互通婚姻的情形，現正日益增多。</p>
<h3>舊式華商最富庶　日人對美表忠心</h3>
<p>夏威夷島上，人口的百分之六十是亞洲種。中國人有兩萬八千人，日本人有十五萬五千人，菲律濱人有五萬兩工人。雖然異族通婚很盛行，但另一方面，東方民族的結合却還在自己的種族圈子裏找對象。中日兩國僑民，都保守家庭的舊式傳統習慣，不准兒女們和外族通婚。中國人是上述三種中最富有的民族，大多是鉅商當豪，和職業界中人物。日本人都屬於小農民，小店主，和小製造商階級。菲律濱人大部仍舊是墾植的勞動者。中·菲·日·這三個民族，全都受到女人荒的痛苦，因爲到島上去的，大抵是在糖甘蔗田裏種田勞動的獨身漢·中·菲·日三民族都會屢次以經濟的原因，（並非是種族上分歧的原因）而被普遍地憎恨過，可是中日兩族是島上品行最好的民族。（品行最惡劣的，要算普多黎剛種人半雜種夏威夷人，和菲律濱人了。）中國孩兒送校就學的百分比，比較高加索人的還要高，孩兒入學的百分比，高加紫人以下，就輸到韓國人了。日本人中，雖有少數在載時作間諜，大部份却忍耐地，勇敢地，對美國表示着忠心，即使在　　的碑記上，他們也並用英文字和美國的方式樹立或雕刻着。</p>
<h3>夏威夷成為天堂　與自由精神有關</h3>
<p>一七七八年，柯克船主發現島上的原始夏威夷人，這是一個自傲和快樂的種族。人們說：這個種族在逐漸消滅中，它在十八世紀石器時代，有三十萬人口，到一八七二年時，祇剩五萬七千人。其中人口劇減的原因，全因白種人染帶過去的　腮炎，麻疹，和百日咳等傳染病，以致死亡率激增。在今日如果計算它的沘血種人口，倒也佔到島上全人口的百分之十五，那便是七萬五千人的數目。其中有些家庭，也是富有之家。預料終有一日，全島人民勢必都變成半雜種的夏威夷人</p>
<p>島上的原始居民，一向是海的愛好者。過去如此，現在也還是如此。人們以爲這些原始居民是西印度移殖過去的高加索種。據說：在公歷紀元後五百年，他們方從薩摩亞搬到島上去的。他們沒有被其他太平洋上的民族征服過，一直到一八九八年，始終度着自由獨立的生活。這一點事實，加以他們素來寬容和自由的傳統精神，對於夏威夷島的成爲萬族的天堂，多少有些影饗在內。</p>
<h3>整理收復區公司　所引起的問題</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>自抗戰勝利，收復區工商業州組織之整理，頗爲各方所關心，而其帳面資本金額之應如何折算，及新舊股東權益之應如何調整，尤爲討論之焦點。上海市商會及各同業公會，並已屢向政府有所建議。行政院近所通過之「收復區公司登記處理辦法」，可謂已與吾人以相當之答案。但因此又引起若干問題，尙待吾人之探討。謹就管見所及，條舉如左：</p>
<p>資本之折算</p>
<p>其結果，可謂與市商會及會計師公會等，所建議之原則相符合。蓋就表面言，雖似將偽幣資本二百作一，而其增資僞幣所購置之財產，旣可酌按法幣姑價，並許照新舊股東擁算，新股所攤得者，作新股之股份，餘作公積，則其結果仍許平掉也。財產估價後，如不敷平掉，自應減低其資本金額；但如超過資本金額，將許其升作增資之用乎？且估價結果，如何方爲相當，如何方爲不虛抬資本金額乎？此中關鍵，當在財產估價之標準。就法理及會計原理言，除淸算以外，當以原價與時價間之低價爲原則。換言之，財產之記帳金額，當爲原價，原價低於時價時，則可照時價拆減之，但此似非所論於資本折算。且僞幣資本金額之二百作一，就會計上言，本屬牽强，原非可引用平時之處理原則者。然則今茲之佔價，要當以根據時價爲原則，當此幣值低落，物價上漲之際，除極少數工商業之有特殊變態外，帳面資本金額僞幣之平掉爲法幣，似無問題，虛抬二字，不值得加以過慮。至於超過額之可吾升作增資之用，則就「餘作公積」一語解釋，當屬可行。蓋公積原可充作增資之用，不過此種增資手續，不宜與此次折算僞幣資本一併辦理，以淸界限耳。信如此，則人人所焦慮之</p>
<p>課稅與分紅</p>
<p>問題，便可於此得一答案，凡因估價而發生之財產升值，其攤算於股東，以凑足帳面資本金額僞幣之平掉爲法幣者，似非通常之分配盈餘可比，無須負擔所得稅，亦無須受分紅慣例之拘束。至於以估價餘額之公積，充作增資之用時，其應吾課稅與分紅，須先從公積之定義上，加以解釋。查公積金爲公司法第一百七十條之所明定，屬於未經過課稅之盈餘滾存性質。故在分配與股東作為增資之用時，尙須負担課稅，而職工分紅，則係勞資間自由之協定，其盈餘之非出於實際生產及營業行爲者，並非必須分紅也。近來勞資糾紛日多，凡紙上富貴所引起之誤會，實爲工商業前途之暗礁。資方者對於職工，固應加以體恤，而職工之對於資方，要亦當有所谅解。論者或據資本還元法，以說明數年來資本實值之低落，工商界更屢屢指陳物資數量缺少之可危，其言或不免稍偏，但於調整資本之際，確未可因此而謀過分之分潤。</p>
<p>舊股東權益</p>
<p>之保全，在行政院之處理辦法內，亦已兼籌並顧，甚至新舊股東之董監名額，並有張制之規定。然每富公司增加資本時，舊股東往往未及參加，其歸自內地者，對此屢有責難。處理辦法內旣未明定，似應由新舊股東從情感上自行協定，吾則從此多事矣。考公司之行爲，原應依照公司法，公司法對於增資，明定須爲變更之登記，但有股東會之決議者，縱怠於變更之登記，初不妨礙其行爲之成立，則其股東會之召集及決議手續，如無違法之處，其增資之行爲，原應作爲有效。且年來公司增資之出於不得已之原因者甚多，舊股東對此，當然亦能諒解。在其離去原來住址以後，如無相當之補救辦法，在其自身亦不能謂毫無責任，不能以未獲通知，或以及未及參加爲理由，主張補認新股之權利，於此，吾人不能不想及</p>
<p>股東會糾紛</p>
<p>之另一方面矣。在公司社團法人，股東會原爲其內部最高之總會，一切的內部糾紛，原可於股東會內解決之。但當此新舊股東權益尚未確定以前，其總會之召集及表決，究將何所依據乎？又凡對於財產估價發生疑問時，將如何求其解決乎？公司法對於財產之估價原有限制，凡增資時有以實物出資者，須先在股東會內提明，並須次議其估價，足徵立法對於財產估價，十分注意。然則財產估價未定，即資本金額之調整未定，亦即新舊股東之股權朱定。夫新舊股東之股權旣未確定，則此股東會當然不能解次財產估價問題之糾紛。惟吾人如就處理辦法之用意而言，當在儘速將收　區公司處埋就緒，然後進而爲登記，然則在新股東，似應先就偽幣按二百作一折合之法幣本金額，行使表決權。此等辦法，在表面上雖似吃虧，但舊股東之資本實値，同未升足，實際上亦不無吃虧之處。總須堸產估價擬與各股東後，再行召集股東會，方爲情法兩全。當此收復區公司整理之初，事甚切要，爰舉所見，願與工商界一商榷之。</p>

<p>軍事調處工作，業已進入第二階段，冀東·魯南·察綏和蘇北等特殊名辭，勢將成爲過去。目下揚州情形，曙光初現，萬千人民歡度新春，情緒的熱烈，不减於勝利初期。記者於歲尾抵揚，度此勝利後第一個新春，願將耳聞目睹，報告於蘇北旅外人士少前。</p>

<p>春到人間，瘦西湖畫舫煥然一新。船孃無恙，歌聲婉轉。春風吹來，雖還帶殘冬寒意，可是五亭橋，平水堂，已充滿了一片蓬勃氣象。冷落了八年的觀音山，財神日的香火特別旺盛，勝利後第一個新春，是應該在微一下的。</p>
<p>縣長避難　自敵寇無條件股降後，蘇北各縣漸次復員，那知共軍屢次進迫，高郵·興化·泰與和天長等縣縣長，均遵令不加抵抗，率領當地人民，逃避至揚。現在一面撫慰流亡靑年，一面再謀建再建設，再度復員，當是意料中事，不過流亡靑年，今日瞻望家鄕，彌增無限痛苦。</p>
<p>堤壩待修</p>
<p>江北運河工程局，現正籌備堵閉去年啓放之師江各壩，並計劃修理瓜洲堤岸工程，以防夏秋江潮衝刷堤身，而免東西兩堤內農田受害。又因黃河次口未堵，若遇淮水高漲，黃水泛濫，運河不能容納，下河各縣將成澤國，故該局擬向救濟總署請領欵項，舉辦各項工程。</p>
<p>公路改善</p>
<p>從江邊六圩到揚州，有公路十餘公里，戰前因有聯運的公共汽車，便利非常。現由一九二〇年的改裝本炭汽車替代，沿路停止修理，車頂上也要搭客，深望公路當局設法改善。揚泰公路，勉强通行。揚州向北到邵伯·高郵·淸　等地，祗好利用民船·最近公路總局，已派員前來視察，即可據具修復計劃，從事整修。</p>

<h3>新鄉動人的一幕</h3>
<p>編者先生：這是最近新鄕一幕動人的場景。我是沁陽人，我　將目睹眞情錄出。共產軍於日宼投降後，攻陷豫北沁陽，博愛，溫孟，籌縣，自稱為「解放區」，「解放區」民衆因不堪壓迫，紛紛逃至開封新鄕一帶，流亡失所，情狀至慘。調處執行部新鄕小組二次返新後，沁傳兩縣人民代表男女千餘人，於二月六日下午結隊在新鄕遊行請願，在路上高呼「我們不願做解放區的囚徒」，「解放區就是大牢獄」，「我們堅次反對劃豫北爲解放區」等口號。至三人小組門首後，請求各代表予以接見，謹有政府代表在門口婉勸大衆回去。各民衆聞音，紛紛跪倒，伏地痛哭，呼籲「我們要回家」，「請八路軍趕快撤出沁陽博愛「請中央軍西開收回沁陽」。觀看之本地民衆，也因動人之情，淚滾滾下。後經多方解勸，哭聲稍小，而淚珠不止。漸漸起立，仍聚集不散。筆者悄悄問，一位年近七旬之老翁，何故請願？據云，「我是博愛東關人，今年六十六歲，只有一個兒叫馬常山。八路軍攻下博愛後，只說組織民兵，誰知攻沁陽城時民兵，也開上了，不給我兒子槍，叫他抬梯子，白白送了性命」。說吧，哽咽不能成聲。一個十二歲的小姑娘，含淚問另外一位詢問的人說，「我爹給八路抓住了，硬說是國民黨，在沁陽叫槍斃了！」我挿口問他爹，到底是幹舍的？她說，「跟旅長（即現在保安旅旅長李總基—筆者）打遊擊，我也不知道幹啥。我的媽急的半瘋，三舅把我們帶出來」。說着，民衆經解勸，全體合淚高呼，「請三人小組千萬主持公道，叫我們回家」。大衆漸往西行。筆者目賭同鄕父老如此慘痛，回家時心中千頭萬緒，不覺含淚書此不成文之數語，請予發表。新鄕　晨平謹上。</p>
<h3>社論　新生活運動十二周年</h3>
<p>自有新生活運動以來，今天已十二周年了。我們在國土重光，建設伊始的今日，來紀念新生活運動的十二周年，檢討過去，策勵將來，其意義至爲深長。蔣主席於十二年前倡導新生活運動，原在針對時弊，勉我們日常生活的必須有嚴格的規律，方能振奮圖强。中喊自辛亥革命以來，繼之以五四的新文化運動，在打倒「孔家店」的呼號下，對於我們固有的優良傳統，往往不加珍轉，　自鄙柴。所有我們民族固有的道德價值，日益傾圮。同時，國人生活習於安閒無爲，以致行爲散漫，不自　奮。蔣主席之　尋新生活運動，一面在恢復我們固有的道　規律，一面要使我們的個人生活知所振作，有所革新。這實是挽救我們　風的一服良劑。國家原由無數個人所組成，若使沒有個人生活上的革新，何以能使國家革新，何以能使我們的國家列入現代國家之林？有人以為新生活應該有新道德，不能以恢復固有通德爲滿足，殊不知道德價値無所謂新　，道德規律之爲我先民所遵奉者，何嘗因時間之變異而異其值。如何維案我們固有的道德價值，以適應我們當前的新時代及我們的新生活，當是新生活　動的主要課題。這在我們建國的大業上，實是最基本的工作，一切物質建設，我們　管可以迎頭　上去，但我們國民的個人生活，如何不澈底革新，彷彿如在沙灘上造摩天高樓一樣，必將傾圯。故新生活運動的普遍推行，實爲建國的首要，這可不待　言。</p>
<p>十二年應是一個不太短的時間。這十二年來抖行新生活運動的結果，使我們終不能否認其成效方的依歸未臻顯著。今日，與十二年前的今日，我們試間在國民生活上倒底有了革新沒有？我們個人的生活倒底有所振作沒有？時問的不遵守依舊；個人生活的不自振作也依舊。十二年後的今日，與當初何曾有什麼難殊？我們偶一思及，滅不免感慨多端。排行新生活的團體、在全國也不能算少，十二年來爲推行新生活運動所支出的欵項，為數也相當可觀，但何以成效如此？</p>
<p>第一，是由於我們的未能躬自實踐。各地從事推行新生活運動的人，個人的生活若不足爲人表率，以身作則，安能望其所推行之運動能有成效？推行新生活運動，高貼標語，敎人家不要坐車子，坐轄子，要養成走路的習慣，而各地主持推行的人，出入未必不坐車轎，如此而求推行，豈非滑稽？必各地推行新生活運動的人，躬自踐新生活的規律，然後方能期其有效。</p>
<p>第二，我們覺得有難以言的，就是新生活運動所定的行爲規律過於嚴苛。過於嚴苛，則難以奉行，而又不能不奉行，則惟有陽奉陰違，而虛僞作弊之風乃日盛。此其在一般民衆，對於新生活運動之認識上，影響至爲不良。例如吸烟飲潛，爲新生活運動所不許。烟酒　是有害的嗜好，但在個人，原有自由。個人如果有飲酒的嗜好，公餘之暇，與良朋三五，把酒傾談，祇要適可而止，不喝得酩酊大醉，或則酗酒滋事，原與道德價値無損，或爲人生必要需劑。此雖不足爲法，要亦不必嚴加取締。新生活運動有此明文，以致在若干實行新生活之地區，酒樓餐館，不許公開賣酒，而藉口喝茶，實則飲酒，掩耳盜鈴，數見不鮮。影響所及，爲害實甚。新生活運動的推行，原欲使人明禮知恥，在個人生活上有所振作，若推行之結果在使人造僞作弊，豈非違背我主席倡導新生活運動的一番至意？</p>
<p>蔣主席此次來滬，在跑馬　民衆歡迎大會的席上，對民衆所致的訓詞，諄諄以恢復固有道德實踐新生活相勗勉，可見主席對於新生活運動的推行如何重視。主席說；「我以爲今後建國與堡障獨立自由，最重要的就是要　復中國固有的道德，發揮我們建國新的精神，實　我們新的生活，來轉移麻木遲鈍的風氣。我們每一個同胞，一定要明禮義，知廉恥，負責任，守紀律。現在我們盟邦美英蘇法等國之所以能成其强大，完全是由於他們一般國民道德高尙，對於國家能自動的負責任，守紀律，能公而忘私。能國而忘家，我們如要與各盟邦謂獨立自由，立在平等地位上，我們就要像他們一樣的愛國，一樣的道德，一樣的精神，……纔能立於現代國家社會之林。一所以在我們建國的工作，如前所說，新生活運動的推行，實爲最基本的工作　過去推行新生活運動的欠著成效，使我們對此後新生活運動的推行，知所警惕。茲當新生活運動十二周年紀念日，願就觀民所及，對此後新生活運動之展開，有所論列：</p>
<p>第一，新生活遝動以恢復我國固有道德使我們日常生活能够負責任守紀律爲主要標的，其對於個人生活規律爲過嚴苛之規定者，似不妨加以修正；庶幾此項建國之基本運動能普遍展開，而無不良影響。過嚴則難行，要使新生活運動能够爲一般人所實踐，個人自由之限度，必須放寬。同與固有道德不相違背的行爲，可不必懸爲厲禁。吾則枝節繁苛，愈推行而與推行之目的距離愈遠。鑒於過去推行新生活運動之欠著成效，此點當特別注意。</p>
<p>第二，我們要指出的恢復固有道德，不是復古而是維新。道德無新　，我們前而已經說過，道德亦無中外之別。道德價值是中外無殊的，外國文字上雖不一定有像我們禮養廉恥這四個字，但外國人的行為規律亦無不以禮義廉恥爲準繩。主席在跑馬　對民衆的訓詞裏，敎我們要學他們的道德精神，可知恢復固有道德並不是盲目的復古。西洋的道德精神，包括蘇聯在內，與基督敎州着深緣。他們在道德規律之外，還有宗敎規律來規範他們的行爲。新生活運動以恢復固有道德爲主要課題，在惟行方面也許需要一種新的動力。我國因有道德與基督敎的道德規律可以說是二而一的；我們要澈底學習西洋的道德精神，對爲西洋文明之骨幹的基督敎規律亦不，可不多加注意。</p>

<h3>檢舉李澤附逆案　昨午續審旁聽記　檢舉人方面　請封被告財產</h3>
<p>新新事長等多人被傳到案作證　最後庭諭調查完畢改期開庭辯論</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕李澤案昨日再審，被吿所延車士釗·陳　銳兩律師均出庭·檢舉人方面之法律顧問沙千里亦到，但格於訴訟法規，不能參加辯論，僅獻坐席間，指示一切。昨日雙方各有陳述，並傳訊金宗城等大批證人，各情如下：</p>
<p>二時半過，劉毓桂庭長偕曹駿蔡晉兩推事及檢察官書記官等蒞庭，於押上李澤後，即命書記朗讀上次被告所供筆錄，問李澤有無錯誤，李即提出二點修正。繼之又朗讀上次諸檢舉人之口供筆錄，皆稱無誤。至此庭上即詢李澤有無意見，李稱：戰前海關對於新新公司罰欵事並非漏稅，乃爲誤會。而關於將新新玻璃電台機件獻敵事，爲日僞所强迫接收，當時且不祇新新一家。至於地下工作事，</p>
<p>他們說我用錢買來</p>
<p>我不願多辯，將來自有事實證明云。繼之舒月橋稱：李澤如稱有功而欲脫罪，則汪逆過去亦有功於民國。且李所提之證人皆爲與其有關者云。另一檢舉人韓武成稱：此次主席蒞滬，上海棉布業爲被當時僞商統會收買紗布，特登報向主席呼籲救濟事，於此可見僞商統會為害之烈。而李爲自動發起組織商統會者，且爲該會之籌備委員，成立後又當選爲理事，並爲提案審查委員，參加</p>
<p>歐宴日本經濟使節</p>
<p>小倉等人，此皆有報可證云。同時並要求庭上（一）傳訊新新公可日顧問木下豐，（二）吊閱僞商統會之宗卷及會議記錄，（三）調查姜公美案與李澤有關各點，（三）調查警備司令部督察長畢高奎之被撤職及稽查處長程一鳴被記過與李澤案牽運各節，（五）立即查封李澤之財產，（六）向公用局查詢李澤之僞商統會汽東執照號碼。至此陳霆銳律師起立稱：上次請庭上派員會同雙方調查有關賬目。今被吿方面已由立信會計事務所潘序倫會計師將新新公司森大鐵廠·新大銀行·上海興業銀行·上海企業銀行·票據交換所等各種</p>
<p>有關賬目審經過</p>
<p>著有報告書，特此呈上。庭上繼訊新新公司董事長金宗城，據稱：當時森大鐵廠購買新新公司水汀鐵業，確由我介紹，但購買日期及價格等則不知云。繼問新新公司職員何家良，據稱：將水汀出賣予森大時，由我在新新旅館門口過磅，由木炭卡車運送共三百多祖。森大鐵廠事務員費偉之稱：由我到新新公司車運並過磅，卡車則係向榮豐紗廠商借者。繼訊榮豐紗廠司機陳孚恩證明屬實。至此劉庭長即向新新公司事務經理唐成章，並令當庭簽字，以與出售水汀鐵有關賬册所簽之字核對，陳律師即呈上傳票簿一本，並稱：唐之簽字方式不一，可以此參考。劉庭長於傳訊新新出納主任陳耀樞及股員汪同聲吳直之後，再問李澤。李稱：姜公美根本與我無關，今姜已被捕，可請關查。至此劉庭長即稱：本案經檢舉人及辯護律師各提出證據，當由本院斟酌裁定，認爲必要時加以調查。而韓武成又起立稱，車運水汀鐵資敵事，尙有新新職員王勝茂。黃克文，徐可康三人目睹，可作證明。</p>
<p>庭上一五訊仍之後</p>
<p>李澤即稱：此三人皆為檢舉人代表，說話故檢舉人不可作證人。且假如我眞將水汀鐵送與日人，又何必過磅，庭上又傳訊森大鐵廠經理韓志明及新大銀行經理鄭家駒，韓稱：所購溶剩之新新水汀，今已車運到院。繼之韓武成又舉非檢舉人代表之新新職工兪更生作證，且曰新新職工四百多人，皆可作證人，兪即將敵軍用卡軍如何至新新車運水汀鐵事陳述。審訊至此，庭上即諭調查完畢，改期開庭辯論。</p>
<h3>同日另審　兩漢奸案</h3>
<p>又昨日上午另有兩漢奸案審訊，計（一）浦東楊思橋敵憲兵隊密探高全生，由被害人丁維良黃海根陳述被害經過，（二）僞浦東保安大隊情報員陳有田，各案均諭改期再訊。</p>
<p>今日上午九時半將開審生生牧塲職工控吿塲主沈萬靈漢奸案。</p>
<h3>新運十二週年瞻望</h3>
<p>— 錢大鈞</p>
<p>民國二十三年二月十九日　蔣主席在南昌倡導新生活運動以後，到現在已經十二週年，無論中國外國，無論城市鄕村，無論男女老幼，大家都知道「新生活」運動這個名詞，而且大家都與口同聲的講要實行新生活，但是事實上究竟有幾個人眞正實行了新生活呢？就整個社會　家來看新生活運動的實效究竟有多少呢？十二年來，國家民族遭遇着生死存亡，安危絕續的危擁，然而政府與社會都在積極進行這項工作，因爲「新生活運動」，實在是一個肚會運動，也是民族起死回生的運動，如果我們檢討十二年的成績，當然興理想差得很遠。不過，我們應該認識淸楚，新生活運動所以不能廣泛普遍的成功，主要的原因當然是受日本帝國主義破壞與阻碍，第二個原因就是一般社會上有智識，有地位，有責任的領導人物，沒有正確的認識，更缺乏身體力行的次心。新生活運動不是口號標語可以獲得成功，必須人人實行，才能成功，尤其在中國，我們同胞生活疾苦，知識落後，急須社會領導人物去提倡，才能上行下效。新生活運動的理論完善，辦法良好，如果我們能集結各方面的力量來倡導民　　　　它是建設新中國的一個基本運動！</p>
<p>一種運動，一種思想，我們用計會進化的觀點支研究，可以知道一定具有時間性與空間性。我們基於「眞理不怕　毀」的原則，來究討新生活運動的理論是否正確？是否合乎今日情勢的需要？</p>
<p>新生活運動，就是提倡「禮義廉恥」的規律生活。以「護義廉恥」之業行，習之於日黨生活——「衣食住行」四事之中。「體　廉恥」是新生活運動的內容，「禮」是規規矩矩的態度，「義」是正正當當的行爲，「廉」是淸淸白白的辨別，「恥」是切切實實的覺悟。如果「禮裝廉恥」　諦能够認識淸楚，相信沒有一個人懷疑或侮　新生活運動。至於「禮養廉恥」對於社會國家的關係，我門根據　主席的解釋：</p>
<p>「禮者，理也；理之在自然界者，謂之定律。理之在社會中者，謂之規律。、理之在國家者，謂之紀律·人之行爲，能以此三律爲準繩，謂之守規矩。凡守規矩之行為表現，謂規規短矩的態度。</p>
<p>「義者，宜也；宜即人之正當行爲。依乎禮—即合於自然定律，社會規律，與國家紀律者，謂之正當行爲，行爲不正當，或知其正當而不行，</p>
<p>「廉者，明也；能辨別是非之謂也，合乎禮義爲　，反乎禮義爲罪，知其是而取之，知其非而舍之，此之謂淸淸白白的辨別。</p>
<p>「恥者，知也；即知有羞惡之心也。己之行爲，若不合禮議廉，而覺其可恥者，謂之羞。人之行為，若不合禮議與廉，而沉其可恥者，謂之惡。惟羞惡之念，恒有過與不及之弊。故覺悟要在切實，有切實之羞，必力圖上進，有切實之惡，必力行湔雪，此之謂切切實實的覺悟。</p>
<p>由上觀之，「禮義廉恥」，實在是社會，團體，國家惟　的規律；「反乎「禮義廉恥」之行爲，其智識技能適足以損人，結果亦不能有利於已，敗　　關而已。故「　義　恥」不獨可以救國，且所以立國」。正如管子所說：「禮義廉恥，國之四維，四維不張，國乃減亡」。主席要提倡新生活運動就是因爲今日社會「禮義康恥」不張的緣故。今日吾國社會，一般心理，苟且萎廠，表示在行爲上面，便是不辨公私，不知本末。官吏虛僞貪汚；人民散漫麻木，靑年墮落放縱，成人腐敗昏庸，富者繁瑣浮華，貧者卑汚混亂。抗戰八年，進步的地步固然多，但是荒滔無恥，貪贜枉法的事情，依然層出不窮，國家綱紀，社會秩序難以確立，這種情形如果長此久往，則數千萬軍民血肉生命換來的勝利又將化爲烏有。中國在今天已列入四强，不僅在政治上講求淸明與效率，在社會上更須力求健全；因爲一個民主國家是以人民爲國家的基礎，社會的力量可以決定政治的改革。中國如果要復興，成爲富强康業的國家，則必須重整社會道德，改造民族心理，而新生活運動正是針對中國舊社會病症而創設的運動；所以新生活運動實爲中國所必需，而且必須繼續努力推行。希望全國各界，一致認淸目標，切實盡力，來完成我們創造新社會，新國家的使命！</p>
<h3>美軍續審日戰犯　陳納德將軍亦到庭旁聽　被告以未參加殺人求釋</h3>
<p>飛虎將軍陳納德昨晨由我航委會外事科科長舒伯炎上校陪同前往提籃橋美軍法庭，聽審殺害美飛行員案。按當年被慘殺之少年飛行員三人，即爲陳納德將軍指導下之第十四航空隊飛行員，當時美方得知其飛行員於十六日被殺後，即於十入日大事轟炸漢口，以示報復，時漢口我國人民無辜遇難者亦復不少。昨日原吿辯論律師韋斯中校，已將其所搜集各犯之犯罪證據，宣讀完畢。被吿辯論律師哈金斯中校及利威雲少校，先後出庭發言，並提出各項理由請求釋放卅四軍軍曹山口久吉·塚田孝吉·竹內良行·籐田純一·水田優等五人，謂彼等只受上峯命令，執行一切，且未參加殺人，但由原吿律師韋斯中校反駁，認爲在法律上凡同謀者，即有罪行。於是五人請求釋放未成。其後被吿律師又請求釋放漢口日領事館員眞鍋良一·領警員浜田正平及靑年隊員加籐巧等，謂彼等乃服務領館，與該事無涉，不應論罪，亦被駁回。午間雙方律師先後傳鏑木正雄少將·酒井定次上校·籐井勉問話，至二時之久。</p>

<h3>前法捕房副總監　愛米諾夫遭逮捕　曾協助敵僞虐害愛國份子</h3>
<p>曾任法捕房警務處副總監之愛米諾夫，以在抗戰期內，有協助敵偽刺探軍情，殘殺愛國份子之嫌，繼沙里後，於數日前，爲我軍事當局逮捕，並已解送法院，將公開審訊。</p>
<p>查該愛米諾夫，又名喬琪，現年四十九歲，籍隸白俄後入法籍。在帝俄時代，曾任皇家偵探大隊長，於一九二二年，入法捕房任刑事科探員，旋擢升爲翻譯，政治股探長，主任督察，及</p>
<p>政治股長</p>
<p>敵軍侵入租界後，受任保甲處主任，並曾一度出任副總監。在此時聞，愛與沙里狼狽爲奸，虐害愛國份子，傳因而日政府曾頒給獎章。我當局乃於週前至虹橋路愛之寓所，將愛逮捕，並以戰犯罪</p>
<p>提起公訴</p>
<p>聞愛在軍法處審訊時，對曾受日政府獎章一點堅次否認。關於沙里之種種罪行，亦諉稱不詳，且謂渠本人亦曾被日方列入黑單中云。</p>
<h3>本市存糧充足　當局將再疏暢來源</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據上海區糧政特派員辦事處負責人語記者稱：本市目前米糧存底充沛，各地去年秋收亦佳，故對本市糧政前途，殊表樂觀。據估計：目前本市存糧，較去年九月間存量超出六倍至八倍。去秋江浙兩省之豐收，經出售者僅佔總額百分之三十，故探究目前本市米價之漲，原因不外爲：（一）一般物價騰漲；（二）產區米價騰漲；（三）投機商之囤積居奇，渠表示本市米之存量原已充裕，現將繼續疏暢來源，務使本市米糧之價格趨於合理化，該處近復擬扶助米商，設法使獲得銀行及政府方面之抵押貸欵，以融通米商資金，利便採購米糧運滬，該處自勝利後，即積極協助各米業公會及米店復業，目前米店已自二百家增加至一萬六千家之多。</p>
<h3>棉毛紡織業工潮　調解已有眉目</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕棉毛紡織業永安·信和·保豐·申新等九廠職工七十七百餘人，自十六日開始怠工後，翌日即由社會局李劍華處長，召集勞資雙方調解。勞方所提十二項，包括範圍甚廣，一時調解難於成立，故昨日社會局又召集四十三廠家之資方談話。據李處長吿記者稱：雙方爭執之焦點，爲去年十一月·十二月份，照生活指數計算後，工資不足額少追補，大部問題尙易於解次。岑日下午二時之談判，如能順利成功，則明日即可全部復工。</p>
<h3>煤氣公司職工要求改善待遇</h3>
<p>上海煤氣公司職工，曾於去年底向公司提出改善待遇之要求十九項，並請求社會局調解。其時社會局正忙於應付其他較嚴重之工潮，故迄未正式調解。現經勞方數度催促，社會局決定將於本月二十日上午十時，召集勞資雙方，商討解次辦法。</p>
<h3>英大使抵滬</h3>
<p>英駐華大使薛穆爵士及夫人昨日午後專機自渝抵滬，在滬將有一星期之勾留。</p>
<h3>持槍行刦廚司　昨日執行槍決</h3>
<p>第三方面軍司令部上海指揮所訊，去歲九月八日晚，有匪首王忠華，糾衆三十餘人，持鎗搶刧浦東塘橋鎭十餘家，分贓逃逸。嗣經九十四軍擒獲匪犯素業廚司之揚州人股懷義一名，呈解第三方面軍司令部。經審鞫直供不諱。該犯竟敢在市鎭肆行搶刧，實准陸軍總部，依法判處死刑，已於昨日將該犯騐明正身，綁赴閩北宋公園路刑場執行槍決，以照烱戒。</p>
<h3>四行一局職工　怠工風潮解決　預借津貼部份答覆圓滿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央中國交通中國農民四行及中央信記局等之職工，上週六以要求預借津貼不果，曾自是日九時至十一時，怠工二小時。四聯分處特爲此事，於前日午後四時半召開緊急會議，出席者除四行一局之負責人外，尙有錢市長·社會局長吳開先·警察局長宣鐵吾等列席。幾經討論，各方意見未能一致。最後經宋漢章徐寄廎等極力斡旋，終吿全盤接受職工之要求，即在正式調整辦法未決定前，二月份之津貼，職員每人預借十五萬元，工役每人預借十一萬元，將來在調整後之新津中扣除。該項預借津貼，昨已開始發給。聞職工方面提出之要求調整辦法，爲職員每月最低之薪津總額爲十五萬六千元，工役每月最低之薪津總額爲十一萬七千元云。</p>
<h3>交大校警被歐</h3>
<p>交通大學師生已絡續自渝來滬，徐家匯原址復員，而臨時大學一部份，現亦在該校上課。但校中尙駐有一部份軍隊，前晚七時許，該校因駐校兵士拆運水管等物，以致發生糾紛，致與校警衝突，以致校警被毆重傷云。</p>
<h3>新運十二週年　舉行擴大紀念</h3>
<p>上海市新生活運動促進會主持之新運十二周擴大紀念，已歷四日，今日爲蔣主席首創新生活運動十二周紀念，該會特在新生活俱樂部舉行擴大紀念大會，各機關首長均將出席，並由錢市長親臨主持，由宣局長顧局長曹書記等爲主席團，屆時定有一番盛况。</p>
<p>昨日下午七時，新運會特邀請該會幹事宣局長假座大美電台，主講，「新生活運動與警察」，又今晚七時新　會特請靑年團曹書記俊假座古拔路四十三號靑年電台，主講「新生活與新精神」。</p>
<h3>永生輪客起風波</h3>
<p>經濟部人員橫遭毆辱　行李被拋江中未撈犯獲</p>
<p>怡和公司永生輪，由英國遠東船務經理處經理，此次運救濟品駛靑返滬，又派運救濟品駛天津，原定前日出口，以裝卸貨件不及，及改昨午起椗。上海天津綫，船雙極少，行旅不便，該輪宣布駛津後，旅客紛來購票，該輪昨晨由浦東義泰興碼頭，移泊新開河太古碼頭，以便乘客上船後起程，當有經濟部派往東北接收工獲人員三十人，由孫祺藩隊長率領，乘該輪赴津轉道前往東北，七時許該隊僱車裝儎行李，抵達碼頭，見船上及碼頭上，乘客擠滿，絡續上船，而甲板上與貨艙兩旁走道上，已無插足之處，該隊因人多而行李又夥，無法安身，當由隊長向該輪事務長許某交涉，乃得在官艙二邊走道上抱膝而樓，一部行李置於艙內，至十一時半將起椗前，突有二英籍水手（形似水兵）入內，不知緣何，突然揮拳舞脚，亂擊亂踢，富有多人，被擊踢受傷，幸均輕傷，故不須醫治，當時秩序大亂，該隊亦在旁，數人上前勸阻，亦遭毆打，該水手並將該隊行李拋入浦江，該隊即登陸招警察，後由十六舖水上警察局，派警士多入隨往，即將行兇之兩水手帶局，並有一較高級之英兵同往，在局經和解後仍各返輪，不料回輪後英水手態度又變，令該隊人可忍，一面即報吿經濟部特派員辦事處，一面再報水警局，經局方通知船長，上項糾紛未解次前，不能起椗，特派員辦事處旋派祝福康趕至船上向船長交涉，水警局亦派員會同辦理，至下午五時半，船長允將官艙前之餐室，讓與該隊住宿，一塲風波，乃吿一段落，該輪定今晨四時出口駛津，至被拋去之行李，常撈獲一件，聞尙遺失二件，一件恐係公文，非常重要，對失物當繼續交涉。</p>
<h3>張詠春逝世紀念　友好設奠追祭</h3>
<p>前上海特別市市黨部委員張　春，在三十三年抗戰期間為日本憲兵隊所捕，在獄中曾慘受毒痛，是年獲釋後，終以受傷過重，於二月十九日不治逝世，今日為張氏逝世兩週年紀念日，本市同志及好友爲追念先烈，特假西愛咸斯路金神父路口淡井廟內設奠舉行追祭，以慰忠烈。</p>
<h3>婦女對國家的貢獻　應該和男女們一樣　蔣夫人漫談東北之行的感想</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　邁天</p>
<p>「有許多人往往忽視家庭主婦的地位和重要性。實際上，這是錯誤的。家庭主婦的責任是非常重要，尤其在抗戰期間，她們不但要照顧丈夫孩子，料理家務，還時時帮助丈夫進行工作。她們對國家的貢獻，實在和丈夫是相等的。」蔣夫人昨日下午在接見記者時，這樣對我們說。假如我們要舉例的話，蔣夫人本人就是最好的例子。</p>
<p>昨日下午四時，記者等得到特殊的機會，在西愛咸斯路孔公館，能蒙夫人抱病接見，並且費了她四十分鐘的談話時間，實在覺得萬分的民激和抱歉。</p>
<p>夫人身穿藏靑色花綢長袖長旗袍，黑高跟鞋，戴黑色耳環。一進客　，就跟記者們一一熱烈握手，並親切地向各人問話。談話問，滿面笑容，時時呼記者「孩子們。」</p>
<p>東北同胞極優秀</p>
<p>記者等問及夫人在東北時對東北同胞之印象，夫人帶着本地口音講話，說她對東北同胞有極好的印象。當她到長春時，當地居民冒雪到機塲去歡迎，使她非常民動。但發現東北同胞的確是受過日本人壓迫的。當她在大會中演講時，羣衆熱烈鼓掌，台上指揮長官命令暫停，以便她繼續演說時，長官一舉手後，全塲立即停止鼓掌。並不像自由的人民漸漸自然停止拍掌。「東北的同胞是極優秀的，他們是被壓迫的人民，而非有組織的人民。如果我們能好好的敎育他們，組織他們，前途一定有極大的希望，」夫人繼續說。</p>
<p>多多為為我類服務</p>
<p>夫人爲了抗戰多年來，許多親戚朋友，及同胞流離死亡，不勝感觸。她說：「做人必須要眼光遠大，求實在，不應只圖眼前。人生短促，浮生若夢，但惟其短促，所以應當努力爲國家，爲人類，作一番事情。」</p>
<p>夫人不但是婦女界的領袖，並且是兒童們的好母親。夫人任戰時兒童保育會理事長，在過去數年中，共收容難童三萬人。爲了他們對於籌措經費，計劃工作，曾費了最大的努力。</p>
<p>接着，託者們向夫人提出了下面幾個問題：</p>
<p>問，「將來國民大會開會時，婦女的選舉怎樣規定？」</p>
<p>答，「女子參加大選，我想也不應有限制；她們被選舉和選舉的資格，和男子是同樣的。」</p>
<p>問，「夫人對於婦女在社會上工作，及不平等之地位，有什麼意見？」</p>
<p>答，「我不能瞭解，為什麼女子不能在社會上有地位。女子也是同樣的公民，雖然我們的經騐也許沒有男子們多，不過事實上，女子比男子更能耐勞。但女子自己也應當尊重自己的人格，勿作種種被男子輕視的行為。至於因為結了婚的女子，就被人解雇，這也是很不斤情理的。祇要她本人有工作能力，或子女長大，不用整日照料，她當然仍可以在社會上服務。這都要看谷人本身的情形及環境來定的。」</p>
<p>對服裝問題見解</p>
<p>夫人和我們談話得十分高興，我們就把話題轉到別的地方去了。</p>
<p>問，「夫人八年多未回上海，這次來到這裏，看到上海婦女的服裝，感覺着有什麼不同？」</p>
<p>答，「我實在沒看見什麼新服裝。聽說現在流行的是短旗袍。我的服飾飾是和八年前一樣，我也不知道什麼是最時髦的式樣。總說還流行着高肩胛旗袍，我見也未見過。我還是喜歡穿長旗袍，而且冷天必穿絲棉袍。我很怕冷，畏旗袍要暖得多。我覺得最時髦的衣服，就是能對健康有益的。」</p>
<p>問，「夫人平時喜歡作何消遣？」</p>
<p>答，「我以前常愛騎馬，打考而夫球，打網球，但現在根本沒有什麼機會。我總想勝利後可以休息一下，可是事實上不可能。不過我們在能出力的時候，還是多做些事好。」夫人又說：「我還常愛散步，同時喜歡古典音樂。我很希望上海的交響樂隊奏演時，也能像外國那樣，由無錢電中廣播，使大家都聽到。</p>
<p>最嘉歡深藍顏色</p>

<h3>黑黑市中交易　金鈔均回跌　公債續挫華股回升</h3>
<p>烚赤昨仍有不公開之少數成交，初開一五四萬，銀根奇緊，為一五六萬逐步被賣方壓小至一四五萬，此際買戶尙形活動，曾在一五〇萬關內外掙扎，北帮源源出籠，銀錢業有被抽查帳目訊，投機帮需款更乏來源，暗拆竟抬高至三角，人心微現恐慌，步降至一三三萬低價，午收一三七萬，較上週六跌半成，午後在一四〇萬以內盤旋，飾金仍無掛牌，紋銀一千六，銀元八一二〇元有賣，陪拆曾喊高至三角，大勢則自二角至二角半。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔初開二〇五〇元左右，後受金價影響，漸形疲軟，自二〇八〇元後轉趨下游，午前降至一九六〇元，午刻一九八〇元至二〇〇〇元間徘徊，與上週六相彷彿，對黃金比率自七三〇元軋攏至七〇〇元對十兩，港票缺乏受主，新貨更疲，結果老貨平平，新貨則盤跌半成。</p>
<p>公債業中略有求供上之讓受，丙種初開一六二〇元，最高一七二〇元，最低一四五〇元，午收一五〇〇元，戊種初開一一八〇元，最高一二五〇元，最低一〇二〇元，最後一〇五〇元左右，雜牌甲乙丁則均在一〇〇〇元左右，多方迫於銀根，續來斬售，較上週六續挫一成。</p>
<p>華股則因同業公會有要求當局允准自由賣買之助力，較爲回堅，但高價迫於銀根，仍有斬多，午刻最低，永紗晨初二二〇〇元，高二三〇〇元，最後二〇五〇元，美亞初開一七五〇元，最高一八〇〇元，最後一五五〇元，景福自一二五元左右降至一一五元左右，結果都較上週六好起半成。</p>

<h3>新生活運動與敎育</h3>
<p>— 顧毓琇</p>
<p>新生活運動，自推行以來，業已十二年。在此十二年中，經過八年抗戰，故新生活運動對於抗戰之獲勝，具有極大之力量與成功。現敵人屈服，抗戰勝利，接收完成後，從事建設。今日舉行新生活運動十二週紀念，　僉討過去之工作，並計劃更進一步之推行。</p>
<p>查新生活運動，為我全體國　之生活革命。以最簡易而最急切之方法，滌除我國民不合時代不適環境之習慣，使趨向於適合時代與環境之生活。質言之，即求國民之生活合理化，而以中華民族固有之德性「禮義廉恥」為基準，習之於日常生活「食衣住行」四事之中。蓋今日之中國，為抗戰勝利之中國，又為努力建設之中國；故全體國民之生活更當適合時代與環境，振作新精神，從事生產建設，永久與列强並駕齊驅。</p>
<p>新生活運動推行之方式，當先以教導，後以檢閱。故敎育與新生活運動，有極密切之關係。</p>
<p>各級學校之敎師，無論在敎室，或課外活動時間，應以新生活主旨及內容，用各種方法教導學生。並以身作則，爲學生模範。俾養成深明禮義廉恥之國民，並能在食衣住行生活中表演出來。至於對於一般民衆，吾人當實施社會敎育，以提倡新生活。如廣設民衆敎育館，國書館，博物館，體育場，舉行音樂表演，美衛展覽，以及演映教育戲劇電影等等，確能使民衆增加新知識，保持身體健康，滌除照習性，養成善良生活。故今日舉行新生活運動十二週年紀念，嘗知敎育事業，實為推行新生活運動之重要方式也。</p>
<h3>昨晚籃球聯賽　仁餘力勝興中</h3>

<p>次場爲甲二部仁餘逢興中，前者在該組極有冠軍希望，昨賽果見仁餘分數扶搖而上，上半時廿一對一四，仁餘勝。下半時仁餘以為穩勝，不免鬆懈，顧森康乘此機會，頻取偸襲，分數愈逼愈近，終場竟成各四〇平手，延長時間，仁餘連獲三球，奠定勝利，終場四六對四〇，仁餘又過一關。汕隊薩柯改期，由混合臨時戰汕隊，不計戰績。</p>

<h3>不敢</h3>
<p>— 小山</p>
<p>陜西有幾句土語，非常別緻，說出來富有言辭美，并且智慧。「不敢」是其中之一。</p>
<p>如果你上店舖買東西，想減點價，打點折扣，老問就會笑嘻嘻地回答你：「不敢賣」　這比較四川商店的「要不得」，江浙商店的「弗成功」，平津商店的「不行」，顯得婉轉大方多了。</p>
<p>如果你和人力車夫談判車資懸殊時，車夫也會十分誠懇地回你一個「不敢拉！」似乎告訴你勞動者的「力」是不容貶値的！非常謙卑，又非常自尊。</p>
<p>甚至當你是說到「老兄是不是姓周文王的周？」陜西人也要似懼似驚地連連作復道：「不敢姓！不敢姓！」</p>
<p>雖然「不敢」在實際上也許已經綸為一句「生意經」和「客套」了，但「不敢」的原義仍是可寳貴的。</p>
<p>不敢就是審慎，週到，約束，簡制，好好地相懷想。</p>
<p>人生是多方面的，我很贊成我們都是一個「能敢」的人，但我更願意我們同時又是一個「不敢」的人。真正的能敢，永遠是包括不敢的，否則會引你走上一條流氓式的路，碰碰就胡來。</p>
<p>能敢的拳手，不敢隨便伸手，不敢到處賣狗皮膏。</p>
<p>能敢的演說家，不敢輕易開口；他的演辭稿，常比初出茅盧的　產。</p>
<p>能敢的作者，他不敢粗製濫造。高爾基的「母親」，　刪了五次纔寄投出去。</p>
<p>能敢的醫生，不敢輕下診斷。出名的外科醫生米勒曾說：「有時候我幾乎不敢看病，我總怕自己會錯。」</p>
<p>能敢的政治家，不敢固執，不敢自私，不敢隨便　險，不敢抹煞人民的趨向。</p>
<p>「不敢」不是畏縮，「不敢」乃是穩固。</p>
<p>想起自己，應該知所「不敢」，看看別人，願該有所「不敢」。不然，聽聽大眾的呼聲，也應該不敢不再「不敢」了罷？</p>
<p>千萬不要以為「不敢」是一個醜陋，倒霉，丟臉的事，「不敢」實在是一個無上的美麗。</p>
<p>國際</p>
<h3>歐洲聯邦制</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>據說美國杜魯門總統現正考慮組織一歐洲聯邦制，這聯邦制不一定完全和美國聯邦制一樣，但在這聯邦中，用的幣制將一律，關稅將統一，一切資源將共同採發，水道將公共利用。這聯邦制將使歐洲得到和平，得到安定，得到繁榮。杜魯門曾和他親信談到此事，但他并不曾守秘密。他在波士坦會議中，就曾提到這主意，他曾極力主張「無限制的公用」來茵河，多腦河，黑海海峽，基爾運河，以及歐洲各國分界的內河。他在出席這次會議的報告中，更直率的聲明，說美國此後將繼續的努力，去實現這提議。</p>
<p>杜總統之所以要採取這種政策，原因很簡單。因為美國雖有意助歐洲復興，一定要歐洲內部自家努力復原。歐洲要想復原，像關稅競爭，貿易限制，幣制紊亂等，一定先要革除，然後才可以使商品交流，工業區供應一切出品。</p>
<p>如，現在挪威極需要鹽去醃魚，同時義大利極需要魚，介這兩國卻無法交易。希臘被隣國惡意的困隔住，不能出售它的煙草，同時其他的國家想尋一些香煙屁股也沒有。魯爾區同蕯爾區，西尼西亞和德斯錢，地下蘊藏着大量的煤，但當地的人不能喫煤穿煤。同時丹麥，匈牙利，荷蘭，食糧很豐富，當地的人想拿食物去調換煤，但兩地無法交易。產煤區的人祇好挨餓，丹麥人，荷蘭人，匈牙利人祇好熬冷。杜魯門主張創歐洲聯邦，還有一個原因：歐洲各國定要除去它們的猜疑，消凈它們的仇恨，聯合成一家人，不然的話，將來免不了又是軍備競爭。將一切資源都消耗在整治軍備中，結果是人民生活困苦，也許再來一次更可怕的大戰。</p>
<p>講到歐洲聯邦制，這主意也并不新奇。十九世紀中，許多有戰的人　，如瑪智利，加利巴狄，　俄等，就以為歐洲各國原是一家人，它們的文化相同，習俗相似，於是他們大聲疾呼，反對各國分立。戰爭時起，戰勝者又何甞不受到損失？可惜當時這聯邦制運動鼓吹不久，就因了普魯士狂妄的威脅，第一次世界大戰爆發，而趨於消滅。</p>
<p>可是別了一九二二年，法國的白利安又喊起「聯合起來生活，團結起來繁榮」的口號。贊助這主意的日多，一九二六年遂有汎歐會議在維也納召開。歐洲所有各國都參加，出席代表達二千人。</p>
<p>當時會議中，曾比擬歐洲各國是一種無政府的狀態。曾主張創一聯邦，使幣制關稅統一，水道公用，軍事外交政策一致；保證各聯邦的平等獨立安全。尊重所有人的宗敎同倫理上信仰。一切爭紛當由聯邦法庭和平的解決。依國際的秩序，和其他國家儘量合作。</p>
<p>推進這運動的并不　　　空雷的理想家，他們都是有聲望的成　人物。邱吉爾當時就曾大　這聯邦制／</p>
<p>反對聯邦制的，當然也不乏人：軍火製造商，國家主義的政客，利用關稅政策的國際金融家，可是他們從不攻擊這制度，他們也稱讚這主意，但他們說這是一種烏托邦主義，是一種達不到的理想。照他們講，這麼大一片地域，這麼多不同的民族，語言不同，怎可以成功一聯邦？</p>
<p>但主張聯邦制的卻舉出更多的反證來，他們說：義大利同德國以前也曾分做許多郡，但經過堅苦的掙扎，全國卒告統一。美國的份子更複雜，但成功聯邦後變成這樣進步的國家。講到地域大小，歐洲祇及美國三分之二，還比不上蘇維埃聯邦一半大小。再有瑞士更是項好的歐洲聯邦縮影：二十二個行政區中，有不同的宗敎，不同的語言，不同是民族，不同的政制，但是，看它們組織成聯邦後，是怎麼一個情形。</p>
<p>當時　護汎歐聯會的，　有二十六個政府。看上去這制度是可成功的，可惜白利安於一九三二年去世，接着希特勒發動侵略手段，引起了世界大戰。這聯邦制久已為人忽忘，直至一九四三年三月二十二日，邱吉爾重講到歐洲統一的必要時，大家才又關懷到這政制。現在雖沒有白利安來提倡，但各國有識的人士，贊成這主義的卻越過越多起來。</p>
<p>照現在一班提倡的人的計畫，英蘇二國將不包括在該聯邦之內。英國自有它的聯邦。蘇聯若一加入，聯邦的範圍將擴展到太平洋沿岸，并且蘇聯太大，加入後將使聯邦制的組織失去平衡。但同時英蘇兩國應當破除以往成見，別利用傀儡政府，或在歐洲樹立勢力圈。因為要使聯邦制度成功，必須使聯邦內各國意志自由，各國政府都能表達該國的民意。歐洲聯邦需要英蘇的友善合作，但除了親隣睦友，也不能存甚麼其他的奢望。</p>
<p>歐洲聯邦制對其他各國有甚麼利益呢？有的。聯邦的軍備僅限於自衛，沒有帝國主義的野心，不會發動侵略戰，所以歐洲聯邦制成功後，蘇聯可以別再擔心到「西方集團」，可以盡全力去發展國內豐富的蘊藏。英國不用再提防歐洲被德國或蘇聯統制，也可以一心去整理國內繁複的內政。聯邦對美國的利益不大顯著，但我們可以知道：美國以後可以不再捲入戰爭旋渦，同時給歐洲用的財力物力，也可以實際用於建設，不致於虛耗浪費掉。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統提議使歐洲水道國際化，也許這是他努力組織歐洲聯邦的第一步。</p>

<p>相聲大鼓的名角山藥旦經辦的「民藝館」，準備趕着在春節前完工。它建築在中央公園的「葛嶺同，預定竣工後第一次演出的是凱旋飛車歌舞團的　幕劇「　　」。</p>
<p>前年「七七」獻馬的劉鳳朝，也帶着他的中華國術馬戲團來趕這春節的熱鬧了。這位六十歲的老先生，前年「七七」牽着那匹訓練有素的駿馬走上獻金臺時，曾說過：「有錢不出錢，不如我演馬戲的劉鳳朝。有力不出力的如我劉鳳朝的馬」報紙上給他的標題是「獻馬雙淚垂，恨人不如馬」？對於那次的獻金，提高了不小的成效。這位六十歲的老先生，看去不過像是四五十歲的，他的父親今年已經八十二歲了，還能要大刀呢！</p>

<h3>學店的末日到了！</h3>
<p>— 羅羽</p>
<p>過去敵偽盤踞時候，本市的中小學校，不但未曾驟減，反如雨後春筍，開張的學店着實不少。於是報紙上常常看得到學校召盤受盤的廣告，野鷄學校充斥全市，這些敎育界的投機奸商們，掮着私人興學的美麗招牌，租一點一點的房屋，亭子間可做辦公室，客堂用三夾板一隔就是兩個課室，天井，晒臺，灶間都可搭起來充數，報紙上登着招徠廣告，更有用空心思使盡手段到別個學校去。「挖」學生來的。可惜的是讀得起書的學生太少了。學生有少到幾十個人的，但是儘可節省開支，可以減少授課時間，教員上課是算鐘點的，薪水儘量刻薄，不請好教師。教師缺課，薪金照扣。遲遲開學，提早結束。學店老闆一次收足了學費，囤起貨色來，貨色起漲，越不肯脫手。教員的薪水可以儘管挨，教員楊腹從公，不敢向老闆啟口，怕的是下學期的粥碗不保。學店老闆們那一個不是大腹便便，出入包車，更可兼做外快，如出賣文憑轉學證書。某中學的文憑賣二斗米一張，只要讬個在他校內讀過書的就行，并且老着面皮掩飾道：「本校熱心教育，助君能够昇學，稍盡綿薄而已。」</p>
<p>勝利了，學店才闆們甜蜜的夢可做完了吧？誤了多少人家的子弟，斵喪了國家多少元氣，使目今上海青年，存着「少爺有錢，那個學校不好讀書」的心理。</p>
<p>雖然，我國敎育落後，尚要多多獎勵興學。對於那些利他的熱心捐貲辦學者，我們當然佩服得五體投地。但是，在上海，這種掛羊頭賣狗肉的學店，對於敎育，實有害而無益。應該要嚴厲取締，廣加合併！</p>
<p>現在上海失常青年之多，所患者并不是沒有學校，而是經濟上的原因。反之，學店取消後，合標準的正式學校，得以增加其學額，經濟自能改善，冗費旣免，於是沉重學業，教師待遇，以及失常青年免費等問題，皆不難迎刃而解。</p>
<p>觸瞬季開學，學店老闆正更立名目，搖身一變，居然以勞苦渏高自居。李戴張冠，恬不知恥，使我不能不出來說這些話。</p>

<p>軍人乘車不守秩序如何糾正</p>
<p>編輯先生：我每天由四川北路底乘坐電車，乘客都排隊候車，秩序良好，而武裝軍人往往不守秩序，自由攀登，反使排除的人，不能乘車，警察也無法干涉，大家只好忍氣吞聲，怒目送行，長此下去，總不是辦法，請問應如何糾正？（莫隆）</p>
<p>（答）此種情形，確是隨處可見，軍人質素低劣，平時缺少訓練，無可諱言。希望各部隊長官，於紀念週或集體訓話時，加以指導，本市新生活運動促進會，尤當負責糾正，倘能各守秩序，予人民以良好印象，自然人人尊敬，豈不是極好的事情，況此事輕而易舉，軍政長官，又何樂不為！</p>
<p>怎樣糾正我惡劣的品性</p>
<p>編者：敝人與友人講話或爭執時，總不願吃虧，又要打抱不平，自知脾氣太燥，我又死不賣賬，不能忍耐，還要管閑事，我所有的朋友，差不多都要斷絕了，覺得很慚愧，請先生指示改過的方法。（林暉）</p>
<p>（答）一個人就怕不承認自己的過失，那末固執成見，始終不易改過自新，像你很坦白的自我檢討過失，真是再好沒有。你最好在發脾氣之前，多多的「想一想」，把火氣忍耐一下，自會心平氣和的。平時可多讀一點古時聖賢的遺敎，像名人修養的書籍，一定可以改變你的性情和度量之而。</p>

<h3>The Ten Major Plans for Streamlining the Military and Building the Nation: Meticulous Discussions and Unanimous Passage; Military Rehabilitation Conference Concludes This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The third plenary session of the Military Rehabilitation Conference was held this morning at 9:00 AM, followed immediately by group review meetings. These were divided into five groups: post-reorganization logistical support, education and training; officer and soldier welfare; career change and production; resettlement of wounded soldiers; and pensions for the families of fallen soldiers. Discussions within each group were exceptionally lively, particularly regarding the reorganization, education, and training, and officer and soldier welfare/career change and production groups, where speakers were most enthusiastic. Officials from various ministries shared their valuable experience and provided opinions. The review meetings lasted until about 1:00 PM. The meeting reconvened at 3:00 PM, presided over by Chairman Chiang himself. At the start of the meeting, each group's reviewed and approved proposals were put to a vote. The most crucial among these was the National Army Reorganization Plan, examined and established by the Reorganization Group. It is understood that this plan is based on the annual military streamlining plan, reducing the existing army to ninety infantry divisions and ten cavalry brigades. When the convenor of the Reorganization Group presented the plan, all generals in attendance stood up in unison after Chairman Chiang sought the assembly's opinion. This demonstrated that the National Army's generals possessed a clear understanding of streamlining the military and building the nation, displaying sagacity and ardent patriotism. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. Over the past four days, the Military Rehabilitation Conference had thoroughly discussed the ten major plans for streamlining the military and building the nation: (1) Defining army structure, (2) Unifying national defense force structure, (3) Reorganizing officer ranks and restoring appointed ranks, (4) Troop education and training, (5) Improving officer and soldier quality to align with the elite force policy, (6) Improving officer and soldier welfare and promoting recreation, (7) Reassigning demobilized troops to land reclamation, (8) Providing generous resettlement for redundant officers and soldiers, (9) Providing pensions for the families of fallen soldiers, and (10) Resettling wounded and disabled soldiers. These plans were successfully completed by this afternoon after the generals in attendance painstakingly deliberated and repeatedly discussed them. The conference achieved fruitful results, fulfilling its historical mission of streamlining the military and building the nation. The conference is scheduled to close on the morning of the 19th, after which the Chairman will personally lead all the generals and soldiers in paying respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and holding a solemn public memorial service at the cemetery of fallen soldiers near Yegusi Temple.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Before the afternoon plenary session today, Chairman Chiang took a group photo with the attending generals to commemorate this historically significant rehabilitation conference. The Chairman also took individual photos with each senior general above the rank of lieutenant general. From the 15th to today, the atmosphere at the conference was filled with harmony and joy. The citizens of Nanjing were greatly encouraged upon hearing that the Military Rehabilitation Conference had been successfully completed. Furthermore, the spokesman for the Army General Headquarters announced tonight that Commander-in-Chief He would hold a press conference after the conference's closing to report on its progress.</p>
<h3>New Life Movement Anniversary: Chairman Admonishes Compatriots Nationwide to Intensify Efforts and Establish a Foundation for Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] On the eve of the 12th anniversary of the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang issued a telegram to the nation from Nanjing, the full text of which follows:</p>
<p>To the General Association for the Promotion of the New Life Movement, and relayed to provincial and municipal branch associations, all organizations and groups, and the general public: The New Life Movement, since its advocacy and implementation, has now been ongoing for twelve years. Its main purpose is to start with cleanliness and simplicity in food, clothing, housing, and transportation, to quickly and effectively reform individual lives, transform social customs, and thereby seek progress for the nation and the people. The aim is for all of us to have a healthy body and mind, so that we can establish a strong foundation, respond to the evolution of the times without falling behind, and appropriately deal with complex matters. This is what this center firmly believes. Now that the War of Resistance has achieved victory, the work of national construction should begin immediately. Our nation has entered a new and great era. Looking to the future, the prospects are bright, but the difficulties are formidable. We must all bring into play the spirit of perseverance and grand ambition in national construction to accomplish this great undertaking. The so-called spirit of national construction, in terms of psychology, requires a lofty belief, a firm will, and a fervent enthusiasm for building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. In terms of action, as I stated last Double Tenth Day, we must strive for daily renewal, seize time, be precise in everything, and be practical in every step to realize the three major demands of the New Life Movement. The cultivation of this spirit of national construction can only be achieved if every citizen constantly examines and improves themselves in the simple, everyday aspects of life, which are also the most fundamental. My fellow countrymen, especially, should strive to practice a new life that is solid and orderly, and become good citizens with ambition and spirit. Do not be opportunistic, do not choose the easy over the difficult, do not be disorganized and selfish, and do not abandon righteousness for profit. Ensure that small families and the large nation all have a thriving atmosphere, sweep away the accumulated habits of routine and decadence, and then the work of national construction can actively unfold along with the victory of the War of Resistance and the completion of rehabilitation, to comfort the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the revolution and the War of Resistance. Furthermore, the essential meaning of practicing the New Life Movement lies not only in seeking individual self-awareness and self-governance. My compatriots must also engage in broad and close cooperation with each other, encouraging and supporting each other to advance together. We should also address past shortcomings, paying particular attention to the widespread improvement of rural sanitation and the enhancement of national physique and productive capacity. Then, with inner and outer strengths filled, and foundations consolidated, the past unhealthy state of disorganization, poverty, and weakness can be fundamentally eradicated. My compatriots can then possess strong spiritual and material forces, as well as a united force of collective identity, to adapt to the great era and shoulder the mission of national construction. Only then can we ensure the independence and freedom of our nation and people, and make our Republic of China a modern nation respected by others. Looking back at the eight years of the War of Resistance, the sacrifices were heavy, and the fruits of victory were hard-won. At this juncture, we should intensify our efforts, understand the principle of self-help and mutual assistance, and establish a foundation for self-reliance. A nation on this earth must have a place to stand. The way to build a nation is none other than vigorous action and self-strengthening. All my compatriots should know that the New Life Movement is truly a movement for national rejuvenation. As long as national construction is not complete, this meaning will not diminish for a single day. We must uphold propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame; take responsibility, observe discipline, overcome decline and corruption, and persevere to the end. In particular, all organizations, groups, and social leaders must lead by example, extend their influence to others, and ensure that this movement continues to flourish and grow, so as not to disappoint my repeated admonitions. I hope you will all strive together. Chiang Kai-shek, February 18, 1946.</p>

<h3>Ordinance on Amnesty and Sentence Reduction Submitted to the National Defense Council for Deliberation</h3>
<p>President Ju Reports at Central Memorial Week</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] The Central Memorial Week was held at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 18th, with President Ju Zheng reporting on the work of the Judicial Yuan. President Ju listed the cases handled from January to December of last year. President Ju concluded by stating that, due to the victory of the War of Resistance and the jubilation throughout the country, it seemed appropriate to grant amnesty or reduce sentences to prisoners in accordance with Article 68 of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China, in order to encourage them to reform and to uphold the principle of rewarding good and punishing evil. Therefore, a draft ordinance of twelve articles on amnesty and sentence reduction for criminals has been prepared, divided into two stages. Articles 1 to 4 contain provisions for amnesty for criminals, and Articles 5 to 11 contain provisions for sentence reduction. The ordinance has been submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for deliberation. After his speech, the ceremony concluded.</p>

<h3>Nine Foreign Reporters Arrive in Shenyang; Claim to Be Traveling as Civilians</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 17th] According to a Shenyang phone call, nine foreign reporters arrived in Shenyang at 3:30 AM this morning from Jinzhou by passenger train. They first stayed at the Northeast Hotel, and later, after the Soviets indicated that the Yamato Hotel was safer, they moved to that hotel to rest. One of the nine is a female reporter, representing the International News Service. The other eight represent the London Daily News, Chicago Sun, New York Post, Associated Press, United Press, etc. Their schedule in Shenyang is undecided, and it is currently unknown whether they will come to Changchun.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 18th] A Shenyang phone call reports that today is the second day of the foreign reporters' arrival in Shenyang. The eight men and one woman are relaxing in the Yamato Hotel, drinking the famous Shenyang-produced Taiyang (Sun) beer, feeling extremely bored. They tell people, "It's very boring."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] Nine British and American reporters arrived in Shenyang by train at 3:00 AM this morning from Jinzhou. Officials from both the Chinese and Soviet military authorities were dispatched to the station to welcome them, and they were hosted by the Soviets and stayed at the Yamato Hotel. They came from Tianjin and other places, claiming that they had not obtained the consent of the Chinese and Soviet authorities beforehand and that they were traveling in the Northeast as foreign civilians, not as news reporters. They will stay in Shenyang for several days and may go to Changchun. This is the first time that British and American reporters have come to the Northeast since the Japanese surrender, and possibly the first time since 1932. In 1932, British and American reporters accompanied the League of Nations investigation team to the Northeast.</p>

<h3>The Situation in the Northeast Remains Depressing; Foreign Minister Wang Returns to Chongqing Yesterday After Requesting Instructions in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 18th] Rumors of new Soviet demands regarding the Northeast issue have not been confirmed by any parties. However, Wang Shijie's hasty trip to Nanjing, claiming only that he was seeking instructions on important matters, is noteworthy. It is reported that Yang Chuo'an, the mayor of Harbin, has faced extreme difficulties since taking over Harbin. Other personnel taking over various locations face similar situations, and their personal safety relies on the Allied forces. There is no talk of security and administration. It is also understood that Pan Gongbi, a special commissioner stationed in the Northeast by the Central Propaganda Department, will return to Chongqing within days to report on his duties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, who flew to Nanjing on the 16th for important official business, returned to Chongqing by plane at 2:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 18th] According to Chinese who have returned from the Northeast: The situation in Harbin is relatively quiet, with a curfew enforced at 8:00 PM. After 7:00 PM, there are almost no pedestrians on the streets. However, the situation is very chaotic in the areas along the railway lines outside Harbin City.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 18th] Ten officials from the Liaobei Provincial Government went to southern Manchuria to take over ten counties within the province's jurisdiction, agreeing to be accompanied by an equal number of Soviet liaison officers. Upon contacting the Soviets, it was found that there were only five Soviet officers. The Chinese takeover personnel had to select five members to join. Subsequently, the Soviet side discovered that one of the five Chinese takeover personnel was from Beiping and one was a local of the Northeast, and accused them of not being takeover personnel directly dispatched from Chongqing, refusing to accompany them. The remaining three prepared to depart, but the Soviet side then said that one of them seemed ill and one seemed to "lack sufficient geographical knowledge," and refused to depart again. As a result, the Chinese side had only one person go to the takeover area, but when he arrived at the county seat, he could not enter. This person is currently staying at the train station, where he is performing takeover work, which, according to Chinese newspapers, "is not very convenient."</p>
<h3>After the Zhang Xinfu Tragedy, Public Opinion Calls for Public Attention</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding the Northeast issue, public opinion has gradually become uneasy since the Zhang Xinfu tragedy. Today's editorial in Ta Kung Pao stated that the recent proposal by the Communist Party spokesman to resolve the Northeast issue was not a matter of internal affairs, and that the Central Army's entry into the Northeast has encountered various difficulties. With the assistance of foreign forces (Xinhua Daily's editorial admitted it was with the assistance of the Soviet army), the Communist Party's army has poured into various parts of the Northeast. The editorial argued that this was contrary to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. Other newspapers also commented on the Northeast issue, calling for public attention.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 18th] Chongqing newspapers are greatly shocked by the resurgence of conflict in the Northeast, accusing the Soviet Union, stating that the Sino-Soviet Treaty is meaningless, and expressing regret over the Yalta Secret Agreement. At the same time, newspapers are severely criticizing the Soviet Union's activities in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 18th] Chinese representatives here held a meeting today and passed the following resolution: requesting the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Nine Eastern Provinces to protect China's territory and sovereignty.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 18th] Amid official discussions here about the renewed conflict between the Nationalists and Communists in the Northeast and the Soviet Union's economic demands, it is reported that eight divisions of the National Army will be heading to the Northeast. In addition to the already dispatched 5th Army and New 6th Army, the New 1st Army, 8th Army, 74th Army, 94th Army, and two other armies have been prepared for departure.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou's Population Soars</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 18th] According to statistics from the Xuzhou City Police Department, Xuzhou's population has soared, nearly doubling compared to before the war. Last month's census counted 266,784 people. This is the number of ordinary households, not including the households of foreigners and temples in public places. Before the war, Xuzhou's population was less than 110,000.</p>
<h3>Early Spring Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>— Rong Qin</p>
<p>It's been four days since the Beginning of Spring. In Guangzhou, in Kunming, those desolate and barren plains should be dotted with tender buds and green leaves. Many people in the Jiangnan region are yearning for and imagining the spring scenery. However, outside the Pass, ice blocks and snow blankets still show no signs of melting. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, snowflakes were fluttering here. People coming from the south constantly utter the word "cold". Seeing children wearing black cotton-padded clothes and leather hats playing in the snow and ice skating, they feel somewhat inferior. Old people say, "This year is much better; it was even colder last year." The climate this year might be the same as in previous years, but in their hearts, there is a different feeling.</p>
<p>Banditry is rampant, coal is scarce, and the burden of life is pressing hard. In the warm hearts of compatriots outside the Pass, there's always something hindering them. Terms like "X Road bandits" and "Big X-zi" never disappear from their lips. Bandits exist in many places, and they are very fierce. However, adding the word "bandits" to "X Road" casts a shadow over people's hearts. People are saying that the X Road Army was good when it first arrived, calling the common people "older brother," "older sister," or "comrade." However, due to a lack, or even absence, of equipment and food, they often seize things from the common people. Many tables and wood materials from homes or schools were taken to cook or keep warm. Living in people's homes increased their food difficulties. Before the National Army arrived, they even burned a lot of the common people's food to prevent the "enemy" from using it. In reality, the New Sixth Army and the Fifty-Second Army had sufficient food supplies. They emphasized propaganda, repeatedly broadcasting the "Zhu De Telegram" wherever they went. The common people knew that it was "Chairman Chiang" who was leading the war of resistance, and few people listened to their speeches. If there were schools in the area, they would also advocate forming "Student Unions" and "Teacher Unions" (Teacher Federations). "I dare say that none of the intellectuals here have joined their party, but some hooligans have," a middle school principal with thirty years of experience in education told the reporter.</p>
<p>I heard that in the areas north and south of Xinmin, the "X Road Army" is forcibly conscripting horses and soldiers, strengthening "popular forces" in eastern Liaoning.</p>
<p>The National Army troops that have crossed the Pass are mostly still in the suburbs of Shenyang or wandering into the city in small groups of twos and threes. However, they are not allowed to carry weapons and are not allowed to stay overnight, apparently because negotiations have not yet been finalized. News of joint celebrations between the Chinese and Soviet armies in Shenyang brings a happy glow to the faces of the National Army troops here.</p>
<p>The price of gold is not much higher than inside the Pass, and sometimes it's even lower, which makes people with a lot of gold feel unhappy.</p>
<p>Reconstruction of education should be a major theme of rebuilding the Northeast. The enemy puppets' fourteen years of rule implemented thorough enslavement education. The arrival of the devil party brought the greatest changes to education. Elementary schools were forcibly renamed National Schools, higher elementary schools were renamed National Advanced Schools, and universities were still called universities, perhaps because most of the educated were Japanese or Korean. Japanese people presided over and supervised all levels of schools. Japanese people serving as vice principals had no respect for the principals. The most alarming thing was the appearance of the curriculum content. The main courses in all levels of schools were "National Language" (Japanese and "Manchu," where "Manchu" meant Chinese), "National Founding Spirit," and "Arts and Skills" (labor services such as farming and plowing). Using Japanese and "Manchu" together as "National Language" reveals their intentions. Although the curriculum was like this, parents were still afraid that their children would not be able to enter school. Many people even used pleading or even bribery to achieve the goal of sending their children to school, because leaving children at home meant even greater responsibility to the "nation." Children who went to school had less time for studying and more time for labor. Graduates of National Advanced Schools (higher elementary schools) who could write their names clearly and write the simplest letter were considered to have excellent grades. Enslavement education even extended to eating and dressing. For example, in universities, Japanese students ate rice ("white rice"), while "Manchu" students ate sorghum. It was considered lucky to have millet to eat. The treatment of teachers at all levels of schools was also different. Taking National High Schools (middle schools) as an example, "Manchu" teachers earned 150 yuan per month, while Japanese teachers earned 200 yuan per month. The rations they received were also much better for the latter than for the former. "Manchu" teachers sometimes felt unbearably poor and dared not even try to make a new set of clothes easily, as the charge of "economic crime" was unbearable.</p>
<p>In reality, the effectiveness of enslavement education was not as great as the Japanese had hoped. Although Japanese teachers at all levels of schools kept a very close watch on thought, and Japanese military police often broke into school gates to interrogate or arrest "ideological suspects," there were still many cases of teachers and students being imprisoned and sacrificing their lives for the crime of "anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese." What the Northeastern compatriots enjoyed talking about most was a scene from 1940. In that year, after the "Wang Clique" government finished performing the farce of "returning the capital," they held a so-called "Japan-Manchu-China" ball game league in Changchun. When the "China" team scored a goal, the "Manchu" team representatives and spectators applauded warmly. When the "Manchu" team scored a goal, they also received the same warm applause. However, when the Japanese team scored a goal, the whole stadium was silent. Some Japanese expatriate spectators who hesitantly wanted to applaud were also embarrassed to do so, which made the Japanese authorities very unhappy.</p>
<p>However, to be fair, education in the Northeast must be rebuilt, and it is very urgent. For fourteen years, the younger generation here has been silently receiving "education"! Children have no opportunity to use their brains, and they must once again enjoy the happiness of thinking freely. The "party-ization education" that has withdrawn from the school walls should not be transplanted here. In reality, the young people here do not like to listen to the "party," but they love their motherland – the mother they have been away from for so long!</p>
<p>As the reporter was drafting this article, the middle school principals and teachers of the entire Liaoning Province had already gone to Jinzhou to concentrate and receive two weeks of training. Elementary school teachers will also receive training starting on the twelfth of the month. Their brains should be filled with more awareness of the "motherland" and a new worldview. Teachers are very scarce here, and in this transitional stage where there is a shortage of new blood, the authorities mostly still use old people. Old people are not necessarily bad, but qualified teachers are indeed very much needed here! (Xinmin, February 8th)</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai on the Northeast Conflict: Advocates Military Mediation</h3>
<p>Claims the Communist Party Does Not Oppose the Central Army Entering the Northeast</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 18th] Zhou Enlai today expressed his opinion on the Soviet army's delay in withdrawing from the Northeast and denied that the Chinese Communist Party was "Moscow's pawns." Zhou stated, "The sooner the Soviet troops withdraw from the Northeast, the better." The CCP does not openly demand the Soviet withdrawal of troops to avoid suspicion among the Chinese people that the CCP has the ambition to take over and rule the Northeast. The CCP does not oppose the Central Army entering the Northeast to restore sovereignty. However, there are already 300,000 Communist troops and Communist Party-controlled troops outside the Pass, mostly stationed in Liaoning and Jilin provinces. If attacked, "accidents are bound to happen." Zhou also said that the Communist Party supports the proposal of Special Envoy Marshall to send a military mediation group to the areas where recent conflicts have occurred in the Northeast, but the Central government has not yet responded.</p>
<p>[Reuters Chongqing, 18th] A CCP spokesperson here today claimed that there are intermittent conflicts between the Central government army and the CCP army in the nine eastern provinces, but the ceasefire agreement between the government and the CCP armies throughout China is being maintained. Several newspapers here today stated that the situation in the Northeast is "critical," and the Ta Kung Pao called for an end to "secret diplomacy" and the news blockade on the Northeast situation.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing, 18th] Since news of the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists continues to spread, people here are increasingly worried about the situation in the Northeast. In the past ten days, the National Army has expanded outward from the railway areas in the southwestern part of the nine northeastern provinces, while the US Navy continues to transport troops from various parts of China to the Northeast. According to a Communist Party report, the National Army under Du Yuming's command continues to advance towards the "People's Army," and the war has spread from western Liaoning to eastern Rehe. After occupying Panshan and Taian, the New Sixth Army also occupied Liaozhong. According to Professor Zhou Jingwen, a well-known Northeastern educator here, there are currently about one million troops in the economically bankrupt Northeast, including Soviet troops, Mongolian troops, Soviet international communist troops, CCP troops, National troops, former puppet Manchukuo mercenaries, and former anti-Japanese volunteer armies. No one knows the exact number of Soviet troops, but it is estimated to be around 100,000. The Soviet international communist troops include people from the Soviet Union, China, Japan, Mongolia, and Korea, totaling 150,000. The National Army includes three armies, with a maximum of 120,000 troops. There are 30,000 Mongolian cavalry supporting the autonomous government of eastern Mongolia. CCP troops occupy southern Manchuria, and Soviet international communist troops occupy northern Manchuria, with the line passing through Changchun as the boundary. Mongolians live near Wangye Temple in western Northeast China, while puppet Manchukuo mercenaries and anti-Japanese volunteer armies are scattered throughout the Northeast.</p>
<p>[United Press Yan'an, 18th] A CCP spokesperson announced today that if Zhang Fakui's troops do not abandon their attacks on the CCP army's Dongjiang Brigade, the CCP's Eighth Route Army will have to reconsider the issue of cooperation with the Chinese and North China puppet armies.</p>
<h3>Leike Flies to Yanzhou for Mediation, Communist Army in Dingyuan Refuses to Withdraw</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 17th] Leike flew to Yanzhou early on the 17th for mediation. In addition, a train carrying grain from the provincial government is supplying the civilians in Tai'an City.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 18th] According to reports from Bengbu, Dingyuan, which is 50 li from Bengbu, is currently occupied by Luo Binghui's troops, nicknamed "Big Belly," with a force of about five regiments. The Military Mediation Department's Xuzhou Group had previously ordered Luo's troops to withdraw from the area, and an agreement had been reached. Recently, it was heard that the troops were using the excuse that the people had asked them to stay, delaying their withdrawal. The Military Mediation Department will send personnel to investigate based on the report.</p>
<h3>Mediation Department Orders Assistance in Sending Japanese Back to North China</h3>
<p>[US News Service Beijing, 18th] The Mediation Executive Department announced today its responsibility for sending Japanese people in North China back to their country and ordered military commanders of the National Government and the Communist Party stationed in North China, and personnel of the Executive Group to assist in the implementation of this work.</p>
<p>According to the department's Public Bulletin No. 13, the large number of Japanese people currently remaining in North China is causing difficulties and concerns. Therefore, the Executive Department is directly concerned with how to move the Japanese people from their respective locations to the embarkation points for the ships in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>The bulletin revealed: "There are currently 120,000 Japanese soldiers and 189,000 civilians in North China. They will all go to Tanggu and Qingdao to wait for ships to return to their country. As for the evacuation of Japanese people in the more southern areas, it will be regulated by the new agreement and will not require the assistance of the Mediation Executive Department's actions."</p>

<p>[United Press London, 17th] The United Nations' chief representative from the United States, Stettinius, said today upon boarding a plane back to the United States that the permanent headquarters of the United Nations are located in the United States, and "its future is brighter than we dare to hope." Stettinius paid his respects to the UK's efforts to successfully conclude the first General Assembly of the United Nations. He stated that all members of the US delegation, upon leaving the UK to return to their country, expressed their most sincere admiration for the British government and people. "San Francisco in the New World is the birthplace of the United Nations Charter, and London in the Old World is the birthplace of the United Nations' global peacekeeping mechanism, shining together and complementing each other."</p>
<p>[United Press London, 17th] The first batch of Secretariat staff appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Lie was announced today.

In other words, they will become international civil servants.</p>
<h3>Atomic Secret Leak Case, Search Extends to the UK, Canadian Official Arrested in London, US Senator Advocates Immediate Investigation</h3>
<p>[United Press Ottawa, 18th] The Canadian government's investigation into the leakage of atomic secrets and secret intelligence has extended to London. It was learned here today that a Canadian official has been arrested there. This development may also involve the United States. It is reported that several FBI agents arrived here from Washington over the weekend. The FBI always has a representative stationed in the Canadian police force. According to a Canadian official, the arrested persons will be secretly interrogated within the month. The country that received the original secret and other scientific and military secrets will be the Soviet Union, and this can be revealed from the confessions. Among these arrested persons are people from several countries, and the Canadian government will consider them as undesirable elements and request their governments to recall them.</p>
<p>[French News Agency London, 18th] According to reports from Ottawa, regarding the arrest of several Canadian military officers suspected of leaking atomic bomb secrets, the government will issue a statement in three days. The investigation committee for the case held a secret meeting today.</p>
<p>[Reuters New York, 18th] Washington electric: Since Canada began arresting spies who leaked secret intelligence last weekend, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee has been asked to investigate the situation within the United States. Republican Senator Bridges stated in an interview published in the New York Herald Tribune: "This is an event with terrible power. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee should immediately conduct an investigation to find out whether anyone in the State Department is preventing the FBI or the Department of Justice from thoroughly investigating this matter." The Herald Tribune also reprinted a conversation with former US Ambassador to China, Hurley, who happily said: "The Canadian incident is related to the information I provided to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last December." Peterson also wrote an article for the New York Sunday Mirror, stating: "Canadian Prime Minister King's surprising announcement has put the State Department in an extremely awkward position. I wonder if our State Department also intends to conduct a thorough investigation? Before ordering the arrest of suspects, Prime Minister King consulted with our State Department, hoping that the two governments would proceed simultaneously, but State Department Director Bellner refused. Bellner knew that the Soviet Union had a spy network in the Americas when he attended the Five-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in London last September. He was very angry at the time, which caused a quarrel with Molotov."</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 18th] Army experts here expressed serious concern about the "repeated leakage" of atomic bomb secrets, which were supposed to be strictly guarded. The leakage of secrets is endangering the United States' position of greatest advantage, and there is no sufficient legal protection for the extremely important information that has now been generally obtained. General Groves, director of the US atomic bomb program, said: "The United States has lost more security regarding this bomb in the past four weeks than it lost during the entire invention period during the war."</p>
<h3>Transporting Supplies to the Soviet Union, Canada Orders Production to Stop</h3>
<p>[United Press Ottawa, 18th] The Canadian government has stopped producing supplies destined for the Soviet Union. This news comes from a reliable source, who said that the order to stop production was issued by Construction Minister Howe and took effect several days ago. However, the source immediately pointed out that the order to stop production has nothing to do with the leakage of atomic secrets and is "purely coincidental." The reliable source said: "The only reason for canceling this production is that Canada and the Soviet Union failed to reach an agreement on loan conditions." However, some still believe that espionage activities by foreign government agents are a factor in Canada's actions.</p>
<h3>Two New Inventions Related to Radar</h3>
<p>Disclosed by the US Department of the Army</p>
<p>[US News Service Washington, 17th] The Department of the Army has lifted the wartime ban on two new inventions of the Signal Corps related to radar. These inventions can detect enemy mortars and artillery positions at long distances and can also detect the movement of convoys and vehicles at night on roads occupied by the enemy. Lieutenant General Douglas, commander of the Army Signal Corps, explained that the radar reconnaissance device can search for enemy artillery positions more than five miles away with astonishing accuracy. The Signal Corps used a special radar to measure the upward and downward direction of enemy shells and then used the principle of geometric triangulation to calculate the entire trajectory of the shell and the accurate location of the artillery position. According to the above method, radar can find hidden artillery positions more than five miles away, with a maximum error of 60 yards. The radar used to observe enemy night movements can detect all moving targets, even in areas where radar beams are scattered. Vehicles as far as sixteen miles away cannot escape its sight. However, the normal effective range is ten miles, and the movement of troops three miles away can also be detected. Radar technicians, with their skilled techniques, can even calculate the number of enemy soldiers in a team and the type and speed of enemy vehicles.</p>
<h3>Arnold Said in the US House of Representatives that the US Must Invest in Atomic Bombs to Maintain World Peace, the Power of the Air Force is Sufficient to Extend to Any Corner, and US Military Bases in the Pacific Should Also Be Maintained</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 17th] Arnold, former commander of the US Army Air Forces, said today in the House Library Committee that the United States must invest in atomic bombs to maintain world peace. The United States must maintain a large and powerful air force, its power is sufficient to extend to any corner of the world. Pray that a third world war will not happen. The Army, Navy, and Air Force must be combined into one. US military bases in the Pacific should also be maintained. As far as we know, only aircraft can carry atomic bombs to their destination for bombing. The only defensive method is to destroy them before they reach their destination. Regarding Marshal Stalin's announcement of Soviet aircraft production figures, I believe that the number of the US Air Force should be determined according to needs and should not be based on other countries' production figures as a standard.</p>
<h3>British Authorities Resolve to Take Strong Action to Maintain Order in Singapore</h3>
<p>Investigation Results of Recent Conflicts Determine Police Gunfire Was Entirely Legal</p>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 18th] On February 15th, the anniversary of the fall of Singapore, communist elements requested permission to hold a demonstration and march on that day, "so that we may firmly remember the darkness of the Japanese occupation era as a warning, and build a better Malaya." After the authorities refused, a conflict between police and marchers occurred that day. Yesterday, the authorities issued an official statement regarding this matter, warning that any actions that disrupt the peace, whether organized or not, will not be tolerated. The statement said that on the night of February 14th, police arrested several people in an effort to prevent possible attempts to violate the ban, but about 200 people still attempted to march, carrying wooden sticks and iron rulers, and attacked the police who were interfering and preventing them. After a thorough investigation ordered by the Southeast Asia Headquarters, the investigation report released yesterday stated that the police action was "entirely legal." The official statement concluded, "The British military government will continue to arrest those responsible for disrupting the peace or inciting them." The authorities' close enforcement of this policy is evidenced by the fact that fifteen overseas Chinese were each sentenced to one month's imprisonment and fined twenty-five Straits dollars on Saturday. Another nineteen overseas Chinese are charged with rioting, participating in illegal activities, endangering life, and assaulting public servants, and have been released on bail pending trial.</p>
<p>Communist Leader Accused of Eight Counts</p>
<p>"Reuters, Singapore, 18th" Lim Ah Liang (transliteration), the leader of the Singapore branch of the Malayan Communist Party, was charged with three cases and eight counts of illegal acts and appeared in the High Court here today. Mr. Lim appeared in court with a bandage on his head. After questioning in court, it was announced that the trial would resume on Saturday. Mr. Lim was remanded in custody. The eight counts include disturbing public order, participating in illegal assemblies, resisting arrest, and escaping after being arrested.</p>
<p>Glimpse of Chinese Newspaper Sentiment</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Singapore, 17th] Since the conflict, various Chinese newspapers have commented that the United States does not forget the Pearl Harbor incident, so why does the United Kingdom argue that the fall of Singapore should not be commemorated? The conservative Sin Chew Jit Poh also believes that commemoration is proper, saying that this day was the day of suffering for the people in the Japanese-occupied areas and should be commemorated to show the determination of all countries in the world to never allow fascism to reappear, and denouncing the United Kingdom for using intimidation to deal with unarmed civilians.</p>
<h3>Scientists' Protest: Atomic Secrets Remain Unshared, Global Situation Increasingly Tense</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Professor Hill, who served on the British Cabinet's Scientific Advisory Committee during the war, issued a declaration to scientists yesterday, instructing them or their representatives to refuse to cooperate if they are not allowed to share in determining the purpose, policies, or possible results of their research. Professor Bernal, vice president of the Association of Scientific Workers, also said: Scientists cannot tolerate the current state of the world. We cannot deny that the delay in sharing atomic secrets is a major cause of the increasing tension in the world situation. In terms of international scientific cooperation, the current situation is even worse than a year ago.</p>
<h3>Belgian Election Results: Catholic Party Wins, Cabinet Resigns</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 18th] According to Brussels Radio: In the Belgian general election yesterday, the Catholic Party won nearly half the seats in the House of Representatives. Socialist Prime Minister Van Acker submitted his cabinet's resignation to the Regent today. The Regent ordered him to remain temporarily in office.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Belgian Capital, 18th] Belgian Prime Minister Van Acker and Foreign Minister Spaak have been re-elected as members of the lower house today. The Catholic Party still holds a great advantage. What remains to be determined is whether the Socialist and Communist parties can obtain sufficient seats in the lower house to cooperate and counter it. The Liberal Party is weak. Election reports from seven of the nation's nine provinces show that the Catholics have already taken seventy-six of the two hundred and two seats in the parliament, the Socialists forty-six, the Communists twelve, and the Liberals only nine.</p>
<h3>Thirty-Two Cardinals Ordained Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Vatican City, 18th] The College of Bishops held a secret meeting at 9:35 this morning, attended by thirty-seven bishops and cardinals. Pope Pius XII announced the elevation of thirty-two bishops to the rank of cardinal. Cardinal Tien Ken-hsin of China was also among them. The bishops read out a pre-drafted edict. Papal envoys waited to deliver the appointment documents to the cardinals residing at ten locations in the Vatican, so that they may receive their honors. The Roman Catholic Church's appointment of new cardinals is the largest this time. The total number of bishops has now reached sixty-nine.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Vatican City, 18th] Pope Pius XII told the College of Bishops today: "I have long cherished the idea of appointing new cardinals, but I was hindered by the war and could not realize it. Now that the war has finally ended, we can implement our planned project. The universality of the Church has now been increased with new glory, because the Church does not belong to any one race, one people, or one nation, but to the masses of the human family."</p>
<h3>Sudden Shift in Soviet Diplomacy: Supports Italy's Counter-Demands, Attempts to Expand Influence in the Mediterranean, Commander of Polish Forces in Italy Refutes Soviet Fabrications</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] London's Sunday Express reports, citing a Moscow correspondent: The Soviet Union has stopped supporting Yugoslavia's demands for Trieste and will instead support Italy's counter-demands. The chief Soviet representative to the United Nations, Vyshinsky, met privately with Italian diplomatic representative Count Carandini in London on Thursday. Reportedly, Vyshinsky said, "The Soviet government will never forget that Italy was the first country to express friendship towards the Soviet Union." The newspaper speculates that the Soviet Union's motive for supporting Italy is twofold: one is to separate Italy from its tendency towards the West, and the other is to expand the Soviet Union's potential influence in the Mediterranean beyond Yugoslavia's current borders.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 18th] Since the resumption of negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia, the dispute over the port of Trieste and the Julian March region seems to have caused a change in attitudes at home and abroad. Yugoslav communist propaganda for the incorporation of Trieste into the Yugoslav Federation has recently eased, while the Italian Communist Party is gradually joining other Italian political parties in strongly arguing that Trieste belongs to Italy by nature.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 17th] General Anders, commander of Polish forces abroad, announced today that Polish forces are stationed along a 1,500-kilometer stretch of the Adriatic coast from Taranto to Udine. The Soviet Union, representing Yugoslavia, sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council, attacking these Polish forces, saying that they are sufficient to threaten future peace. General Morgan, the Supreme Commander of the United Nations, and General Anders both declined to comment. The Polish military information office in Rome declared that there are no Polish forces stationed in the Julian March of Venice, which is occupied by the Allied forces of Britain, America, and Yugoslavia until the signing of the peace treaty. It also denied that Poland is recruiting new troops, using "resistance to Yugoslav communism" as a slogan.</p>
<h3>British Labour Cabinet to Undergo Partial Reshuffle</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] It is expected that Prime Minister Attlee will make changes to some of his cabinet members early, focusing on lower-level personnel. Even if one or two members of the Labour cabinet are changed, the rest may remain in their posts. The most difficult issues for the government are housing and fuel, but the general labor force believes that the Labour Party has made some achievements since taking office six months ago.

<p>[Associated Press, Fukuoka, 18th] The American military government announced today that all machinery and equipment from six munitions factories in the Fukuoka district will be shipped to China and Korea to rebuild destroyed factories and manufacture daily necessities. This measure is in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration.</p>
<h3>Japanese People Scramble to Exchange Cash for Goods</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th Dispatch] The Japanese government's emergency financial and food control orders have led to a surge in buying in markets and shopping districts over the weekend. Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered in Tokyo's commercial districts, each wanting to exchange their money for food and goods. Although rice prices remained stable over the weekend, the prices of daily necessities have soared. Small denomination banknotes of ten yen or less are not affected by the issuance of new banknotes, so people are vying to obtain them. A reporter saw a Japanese person holding a ten-yen note and buying an unnecessary one-cent train ticket from the railway ticket office. Customers entering stores invariably ask first if there are small denomination banknotes to be found, so that stores throughout Tokyo have posted notices asking customers not to hope to find small denominations. According to observers, this kind of turmoil is temporary. Prices are bound to rise before March 7, but prices will gradually fall after March 7, because old banknotes will be discarded at that time, and bank withdrawals will also be restricted.</p>
<h3>Japan's Status Disappears: US Trade Will Change</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 17th] The Department of Commerce announced today that the disappearance of Japan's position as a major exporting country will inevitably stimulate the industrialization of other countries in the Far East, which will have a significant impact on the foreign trade of the United States. Before the war, more than 55% of all US exports to the Far East were purchased by Japan, while Japan accounted for one-sixth of the Far East's exports to the US. This is particularly important from the perspective of the changing post-war international trade situation, as Japan was originally the main supplier of inexpensive goods needed by the Asian market.</p>
<h3>Cement House Built in One Day and One Night</h3>
<p>American Invention of New Machine</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] According to Estes, a Texas newspaper publisher, who announced here today, a huge machine can completely build an inexpensive cement house in 24 hours, like a hen laying an egg, and has now been successfully developed. This machine is equipped with rubber tires up to twelve feet high and can be freely moved to the construction site. The shape of the house is pre-made with steel forms. All that is needed is to pour cement into the steel forms and remove the steel forms after 24 hours, and the whole house is completed. Equipped with glass windows and decorated, it can be inhabited. The house "hatched" in this way has two bedrooms and a living room eighteen feet long and eleven and a half feet wide.</p>
<h3>Egypt Plans to Negotiate with Britain to Fulfill Independence Aspirations</h3>
<p>Eradicate Three Harms in Domestic Administration</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Cairo, 17th] Egyptian Prime Minister Sidqi told reporters today that, judging from the list of new cabinet members he has selected, he seems to sympathize with the students' demonstration in Cairo demanding "British troops withdraw, or we will rebel." He also knows that the spirit of the Sudanese is the spirit of the Egyptians, and our policy is to merge Sudan with Egypt. Sidqi also replied to King Farouk that he will soon submit a list of delegates to negotiate with Britain to fulfill the desire for independence. We must also find ways to ensure domestic peace and raise the living standards of the poor. Illiteracy, poverty, and disease are the three harms of Egypt, and we must declare war on them.</p>

<h3>Iranian Prime Minister Flies to Moscow: Soviet-Iranian Negotiations to Begin Immediately</h3>
<p>Soviet Side Will Refuse to Discuss Azerbaijan Issue</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 18th] A Soviet giant transport plane will carry Iranian Prime Minister Sadr and his selected representatives from Tehran directly to Moscow today for negotiations to improve relations between the two countries. However, whether the Azerbaijan issue is within the scope of the negotiations is still doubtful. Many people believe that the Russian side will refuse to discuss this matter. When Prime Minister Sadr addressed the parliament yesterday, promising to open a new page in relations with the Soviet Union, the whole place cheered. When Sadr left the parliament, the crowd raised him high on their shoulders. These phenomena can all indicate the people's support for the new government.</p>

<h3>Yalta Agreement Sacrifices Our Basic Rights</h3>
<p>US Newspapers Unanimously Criticize Harshly: All Believe Soviet Union's Greed Is Insatiable</p>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 17th] American newspapers today commented on the Yalta Agreement's cession of the Kuril Islands and the southern part of Sakhalin Island to the Soviet Union, and all agreed with what the New York Times called: "The unfortunate result of wartime power politics is inevitable." Some newspapers criticized Churchill and Roosevelt harshly for not consulting with China and directly allowing the Soviet Union to have various rights in the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>The New York Times said: "The most unfortunate aspect of this agreement is that the United States and Britain agreed to sacrifice the basic rights of another ally, China, and then the US President sought China's consent to the fait accompli. Even if the Red Army did not participate in the war before the United Nations attacked the Japanese mainland, Japan had already shown signs of seeking peace. However, at the time the Yalta Agreement was signed, Japan's military weakness and its willingness to seek peace without being annihilated were not yet so obvious."</p>
<p>The Portland Oregonian emphasized the strategic importance of the Kuril Islands, so when people heard that Roosevelt and Churchill had ceded the islands to the Soviet Union, they were generally "shocked." American interests in the Pacific and the broad trusteeship system advocated by the United States have been affected by this. The countries that participated in the Second World War must meet frankly. This is also paramount in the Soviet Union. The Kuril Islands should be re-examined by the United Nations.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Chronicle said: "From the lines of the Yalta Agreement, it is clear that Roosevelt and Churchill obtained Soviet assistance at a considerable price, which is the Kuril Islands and other important concessions, especially those involving China. This agreement was negotiated and signed by the three giants without revealing it to China's President Chiang, and China is the only country to suffer losses as a result of this agreement. From this, it can be seen that the three giants never had the idea of the Four Powers in their minds. The so-called Four Powers are just slogans to divert public attention."</p>
<p>The Oregonian also said: "Some of the islands in the Kuril Islands originally belonged to Japanese territory and have a long history. They cannot be attributed to land acquired by violence and greed." As announced by the Cairo Conference of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang in 1943 and should be taken from Japan, it can be known that the Yalta Agreement has political relations and military relations.</p>
<p>The Washington Times commented, entitled "The Soviet Union Has Obtained the Price and Is Still Not Satisfied." It said: "Every promise to the Soviet Union in the secret agreement has now been fulfilled, but in the United Nations conference in London, it can be seen that the Soviet Union is still not satisfied with what it has obtained and resolutely opposes the wishes of any government that does not obey Moscow."</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence</h3>
<p>Kunshan: Eight Robbers of Ferryboat Arrested The Su Chen Ferryboat left Suzhou on the afternoon of the 14th. When it sailed near Jinshan Port (Wuxian Boundary), it was suddenly robbed by fifteen or sixteen robbers (four of the robbers were women, four wore military uniforms, and were fully armed with a machine gun). At the time, they also kidnapped Patrol Officer Zhao Zong of the Chenmu Police Station in Kunshan and three policemen. It is now learned that after receiving the report, the military and police authorities immediately dispatched a team to pursue and suppress them and achieved great results. Patrol Officer Zhao and others who were kidnapped have also escaped danger and returned to Kunshan. At the same time, it is also learned that this group of robbers was captured on the 15th in Tongli Town, fifteen miles east of Wujiang, by eight members of the 434th Regiment of the 21st Army of the National Army and will be escorted to Kunshan for interrogation.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Investigation of Schools Damaged During the War The Suzhou-Ningbo Branch of the National Relief Commission, in order to investigate the most seriously damaged school buildings of elementary schools in this county during the War of Resistance, has already sent a letter to the Wuxian Relief Association requesting it to forward the letter to the Wuxian Education Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation of the losses of each elementary school building during the War of Resistance and a detailed report to the Relief Association for submission and handling.</p>
<p>Changshu: National Army Regiment Arrives to Take Over Defense Commander Yan of the 433rd Regiment of the 145th Division of the 21st Army of the National Army arrived in Yu on the 14th. One of his battalions has moved from Tai to this county and has been ordered to take over the defense of the Luo Battalion of the Pingding Force of the Loyalty and Rescue Army. The handover of the city defense portion was completed on the morning of the 15th.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Exchanging Counterfeit Money Is Extremely Difficult In Wuxi, the exchange of counterfeit money was initially handled by the post office, but recently it has been handled by the Farmers Bank and the County Bank. However, due to the small amount of funds and manpower, the exchange is limited. Since the lunar new year, small amounts of counterfeit money in the countryside have stopped being used and have flowed into the cities. Recently, because the counterfeit money of 5.1 million yuan in Changshu and other counties has stopped being used, it has been transported to Wuxi. There is a sudden increase in the amount of counterfeit money on the market and the legal tender seems to be smaller. Merchants require legal tender when buying in, but mostly sell counterfeit money. This has caused a difference in prices, and larger goods have also had problems being bought in. The city is in extreme chaos. I hope the authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Japanese Prisoner Kicks Child to Death While Shopping The Japanese prisoner is a sergeant squad leader of the 5th Battalion of the 91st Brigade of the Japanese Army. At about 12 o'clock on the evening of the 14th, in the Luosihama area of Chunbo Bridge in Dongcheng, he had a dispute with a Ming child over the sale of cigarettes. The Japanese prisoner kicked the lower abdomen of the child and then pushed him into the river. The child struggled and crawled home that night. He died of his injuries at noon on the 15th. His family has an octogenarian mother and is extremely poor. After the Japanese Prisoner Management Office learned about this, Director Ye sent Deputy Officers Ding and Hou with 10,000 yuan to the Ming child's house to express their condolences and investigate the truth. He also identified the Japanese prisoner who committed the crime and detained him and has telegraphed his superiors for instructions.</p>
<p>Qingdao: Communist Army Attacks National Army Convoy The Tarte Station on the Jiaoji Railway is garrisoned by a part of the XX National Army of the Eighth Army. On the morning of the 11th, the Communist Army suddenly violated the ceasefire order and attacked the National Army grain convoy with 2,000 troops. A fierce war then broke out. The National Army was caught off guard, resulting in more than 100 officers and soldiers killed and wounded. On the 12th, more than 50 wounded National Army soldiers were sent from Tarte Station to Qingdao for treatment. The situation of the battle and the number of casualties and items are still under investigation.</p>

<h3>New Invention by American Scientists: Mathematical Robot</h3>
<p>Can Calculate Complex Problems in a Few Hours: Will Revolutionize Atomic Energy Research</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Philadelphia, 17th] The Department of the Army held an unveiling ceremony for a giant "mathematical robot" at the University of Pennsylvania on the 15th of this month. The machine is an electrical integrator and calculator, costing $400,000, weighing thirty tons, containing 18,000 vacuum tubes and miles of intertwined wires. The machine was made at the request of the Ordnance Department of the Army and is used to calculate complex ballistic firing tables and bomb-dropping calculation tables. It is said to have great potential for peaceful uses. The inventors of the machine are Drs. Mauchly and Eckert of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, and Dr. Goldstein of the Ordnance Department of the Army. The Department of the Army declared that "this machine is the most complex and intricate electrical invention in the world." The machine can solve problems in a few hours that would take a mathematician hundreds of years to solve. The Department of the Army emphasized that the machine is a good assistant to mathematics, which can save scientists' energy, without having to engage in lengthy calculations, and revolutionize engineering mathematics, industrial design methods, and atomic energy research.</p>

<h3>Most Complex and Intricate Melting Pot of All Races: Hawaii Forges New Lineage, Pilgrimage to the Free Paradise of the Central Pacific</h3>
<p>…Special Translated Manuscript by This Newspaper's Editorial Office</p>
<p>The United States has always been the world's number one racial melting pot, but today, its territory, the island of Hawaii, has surpassed it, defeating it. When Hawaii was first discovered, the island had a population of 300,000, all of whom were the original inhabitants of the island. Since then, people from all corners of the earth have gone there, merchants, workers, adventurers, all kinds, creating this paradise in the central Pacific! The most numerous of the islanders are now Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish. In fact, the residents of Hawaii can almost represent the human race of the entire world.</p>
<h3>White People Called "Hola" Chinese People Called "Boga"</h3>
<p>Recently, when American sailors were leaving Honolulu, a clamor of cursing arose among them. They used harsh and rebellious tones to describe the islanders of Hawaii, saying, "Good heavens! These foolish, barefooted, Hawaiians!" These curses only revealed the minor failures of Honolulu in the minds of a small segment of people. In reality, it has almost become the most successful experiment in the world for mixed-race blends and the dream realm of sociologists for mixed-race culture and education. In Hawaii, there are so many races—purebreds, mixed-bloods, all kinds are present. There is no difference in preference or discrimination. Every race is a minority. Of Hawaii's 430,000 population, there are Americans, Britons, Norwegians, Germans, Spaniards, Puerto Ricans, Portuguese, blacks, Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Filipinos, Micronesians, and Polynesians. Furthermore, there are mixed crystallizations of the above-mentioned races. There, people judge a person by talent and virtue, not by skin color, just like the method of judgment used by the native Hawaiians. White people there are not called white people but are called "Hola" (transliteration), meaning foreigners. Chinese people are called "Boga," meaning "Uncle." Native Hawaiians originally could not pronounce "R," but now they have learned it because English has become the most common language.</p>
<h3>Spiritual Tendency Towards Americanization Mixed Race Component Not Concealed</h3>
<p>This melting pot, with its tolerance of interracial mixing and racial brotherhood, is truly unparalleled in the world today! But it is not without its exceptions. Higher-class white people are not very tolerant of interracial mixing. They retain to some extent the demarcation line of skin color. This is considered an undesirable attitude. However, these people can be said to be exceptions on the island of Hawaii. In fact, a new race is growing.</p>
<p>The new mixed-race Hawaiians are tolerant, patient, healthy, and Americanized. No one there conceals their mixed-race component. In fact, if one wants to apply for a marriage certificate, one must state the racial lineage of the four grandparents. The U.S. official census bureau only registers two races: Caucasian Hawaiian and Asian Hawaiian. Other than that, no matter how complex the ancestral lineage is, applicants are uniformly registered according to their father's race or the racial group to which they belong. Although words like "white" and "colored" are never used, lighter skin colors are ultimately more favored. Some half-mixed-race Hawaiians, in order to avoid ridicule for exaggerating the density of their white ancestry, often register as pure Hawaiians. Intermarriage between Chinese Hawaiians and Caucasian Hawaiians is increasing.</p>
<h3>Old-Style Chinese Merchants Richest Japanese Express Loyalty to America</h3>
<p>On the island of Hawaii, 60% of the population is of Asian descent. There are 28,000 Chinese, 155,000 Japanese, and 52,000 Filipinos. Although interracial marriage is very prevalent, on the other hand, Eastern nations still seek partners within their own racial circles. Chinese and Japanese emigrants both preserve the old-fashioned traditional customs of their families and do not allow their children to intermarry with other races. Chinese people are the richest of the above three races. Most are large merchants and figures in professional circles. Japanese people are mostly small farmers, small shopkeepers, and small manufacturers. Most Filipinos are still agricultural laborers. The three races of Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese all suffer from a scarcity of women because those who go to the island are mostly single men who work in the sugarcane fields. The three races of Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese have all been universally hated multiple times for economic reasons (and not for reasons of racial differences). However, the Chinese and Japanese are the best-behaved races on the island. (The worst-behaved are the Puerto Ricans, half-mixed-race Hawaiians, and Filipinos.) The percentage of Chinese children sent to school is higher than that of Caucasians. The percentage of children in school below Caucasians is surpassed by Koreans. Among the Japanese, although a few acted as spies during the war, the majority patiently, bravely, and loyally express their loyalty to America, even on their tombstones, they erect or carve them in English and in the American style.</p>
<h3>Hawaii Becomes Paradise Related to the Spirit of Freedom</h3>
<p>In 1778, Captain Cook discovered the original Hawaiians on the island, a proud and happy race. It is said that this race is gradually disappearing. In the 18th-century Stone Age, it had a population of 300,000, but by 1872, only 57,000 remained. The reason for the dramatic decline in population was entirely due to the infectious diseases brought by white people, such as mumps, measles, and whooping cough, which led to a sharp increase in mortality. Today, if we calculate its mixed-race population, it accounts for 15% of the island's total population, which is a number of 75,000 people. Some of these families are also wealthy. It is predicted that one day, all the people on the island will inevitably become half-mixed-race Hawaiians.</p>
<p>The original inhabitants of the island have always been lovers of the sea. It was so in the past, and it still is today. It is believed that these original inhabitants were Caucasians transplanted from the West Indies. It is said that they moved to the island from Samoa around 500 AD. They were never conquered by other Pacific nations and lived a free and independent life until 1898. This fact, coupled with their inherent spirit of tolerance and freedom, has somewhat influenced Hawaii's becoming a paradise for all races.</p>
<h3>Problems Caused by the Reorganization of Companies in Recovered Areas</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the reorganization of industrial and commercial organizations in the recovered areas has been of great concern to all parties, and how to convert the book capital amount and how to adjust the rights and interests of new and old shareholders have been the focus of discussion. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations have repeatedly made suggestions to the government. The "Measures for Handling the Registration of Companies in Recovered Areas" recently passed by the Executive Yuan can be said to have given us a considerable answer. However, this has also raised several issues that still need our exploration. I would like to list them below based on my humble opinion:</p>
<p>Conversion of Capital</p>
<p>The result can be said to be in line with the principles suggested by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Institute of Certified Public Accountants. On the surface, it seems to convert counterfeit currency capital at a rate of two hundred to one, but the property purchased with the increased counterfeit currency can be reasonably priced in legal tender, and the new and old shareholders are allowed to calculate together. The amount allocated to the new shares will be the new shares, and the remainder will be used as public accumulation, so the result is still allowed to be offset. If the property appraisal is not enough to offset, the amount of capital should be reduced; but if it exceeds the amount of capital, will it be allowed to increase it for capital increase? And how can the appraisal result be considered appropriate, and how can the capital amount not be inflated? The key to this lies in the standard of property appraisal. In terms of legal and accounting principles, except for liquidation, the lower price between the original price and the market price should be the principle. In other words, the book amount of the property should be the original price. When the original price is lower than the market price, it can be discounted according to the market price, but this does not seem to be discussed in the conversion of capital. Moreover, the conversion of the counterfeit currency capital amount at a rate of two hundred to one is inherently far-fetched in accounting and is not a normal processing principle that can be cited. Therefore, the current pricing should be based on the market price as the principle. At this time of currency depreciation and rising prices, except for a very small number of industries and businesses with special abnormalities, it seems that there is no problem in offsetting the book capital amount of counterfeit currency into legal tender. The word "inflation" is not worth worrying too much about. As for whether the excess can be increased for capital increase, it should be feasible to interpret it in terms of "the remainder is used as public accumulation." Because public accumulation can be used as capital increase, but this kind of capital increase procedure should not be handled together with this conversion of counterfeit currency capital to clarify the boundaries. I believe that in this way, everyone's anxiety about</p>
<p>Taxation and Dividends</p>
<p>The problem can be answered here. The increase in property value caused by the appraisal, which is allocated to the shareholders to make up for the book capital amount of counterfeit currency to be offset into legal tender, does not seem to be comparable to the usual distribution of profits, and there is no need to bear income tax, nor is it bound by the custom of dividends. As for whether the surplus of the appraisal should be used as capital increase, the definition of public accumulation must first be explained. According to Article 170 of the Company Law, the public accumulation fund belongs to the nature of retained earnings that have not been taxed. Therefore, when distributed to shareholders as capital increase, it is still necessary to bear taxes, and employee dividends are a free agreement between labor and capital. Profits that do not come from actual production and business activities are not necessarily required to be distributed. Recently, there have been more and more labor disputes. The misunderstanding caused by the wealth on paper is a hidden reef for the future of industry and commerce. The capital side should show consideration for the employees, and the employees should also understand the capital side. Commentators have cited the capital reduction method to explain the decline in the real value of capital in recent years, and the industrial and commercial circles have repeatedly pointed out the danger of the lack of material quantity. Their remarks may be slightly biased, but when adjusting capital, it is indeed not possible to seek excessive profits.</p>
<p>Preservation of Old Shareholders' Rights and Interests</p>
<p>Preservation of old shareholders' rights and interests has also been taken into account in the handling measures of the Executive Yuan, and there are even Zhang's regulations on the number of directors and supervisors of new and old shareholders. However, when each rich company increases capital, old shareholders often fail to participate, and those who have returned from the mainland have repeatedly criticized this. Since the handling measures have not clearly stipulated, it seems that new and old shareholders should negotiate on their own from an emotional point of view, otherwise, I will have more to do. The actions of the company should originally be in accordance with the Company Law. The Company Law clearly stipulates that the increase in capital must be registered for changes, but if there is a resolution of the shareholders' meeting, even if the registration of changes is neglected, it does not hinder the establishment of its actions. If there is no violation of the law in the procedures for convening and resolving the shareholders' meeting, its capital increase actions should originally be considered valid. Moreover, there are many reasons for the company's capital increase in recent years that are out of necessity. Old shareholders can certainly understand this. After they leave their original address, if there is no considerable remedy, they themselves cannot be said to have no responsibility, and they cannot claim the right to subscribe for new shares on the grounds that they have not been notified or have not been able to participate. Here, we cannot but think of</p>
<p>Shareholders' Meeting Disputes</p>
<p>On the other hand. In a company or a corporate body, the shareholders' meeting is originally its highest internal general meeting, and all internal disputes can originally be resolved within the shareholders' meeting. However, before the rights and interests of new and old shareholders have been determined, what will be the basis for convening and voting at its general meeting? And how will the solution be sought when there are questions about property appraisal? The Company Law originally had restrictions on property appraisal. Anyone who contributes in kind when increasing capital must first mention it in the shareholders' meeting and then discuss its appraisal, which is sufficient to show that the legislation pays great attention to property appraisal. Therefore, if the property appraisal is not determined, the adjustment of the capital amount is not determined, that is, the equity of the new and old shareholders is not determined. If the equity of the new and old shareholders has not been determined, then this shareholders' meeting certainly cannot resolve the dispute over property appraisal. However, if we talk about the intention of the handling measures, it is to deal with the company in the recovered area as soon as possible, and then proceed to registration. Then, for the new shareholders, it seems that they should first exercise their voting rights based on the amount of legal tender converted from counterfeit currency at a rate of two hundred to one. Although these measures seem to be a loss on the surface, the real value of the capital of the old shareholders has not increased sufficiently, and in fact, there is also a loss. In general, the shareholders' meeting should be convened again after the appraisal of the property is proposed to the shareholders, so as to be both reasonable and legal. At the beginning of the reorganization of the company in the recovered area, the matter is very important, so I would like to discuss my views with the industrial and commercial circles.</p>

<h3>Comforting Exiles Re-Planning Rehabilitation A Talk on the Current Situation in Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Our Reader Pei Yun Sent from Yangzhou</p>
<p>The military mediation work has already entered the second stage, and special terms such as Jidong, Lunan, Chahar-Suiyuan, and Subei will inevitably become a thing of the past. At present, the situation in Yangzhou is that the dawn is just beginning to appear, and thousands of people are celebrating the New Year with joy, and the enthusiasm of the emotions is no less than that of the early days of victory. The reporter arrived in Yangzhou at the end of the year to spend the first New Year after this victory, and I would like to report what I have heard and seen to the former Subei expatriates.</p>
<p>Spring Arrives in Jianghuai</p>
<p>Spring arrives in the world, and the painted boats on Slender West Lake have been completely renovated. The boat ladies are well, and the singing is melodious. Although the spring breeze still brings the cold of the remaining winter, the Five Pavilions Bridge and the Pingshui Hall are already full of vigorous vitality. Guanyin Mountain, which has been deserted for eight years, is particularly prosperous on the God of Wealth Day. The first New Year after victory should be celebrated slightly.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Flees</p>
<p>Since the unconditional surrender of the enemy bandits, the counties in northern Jiangsu have gradually resumed. Who knew that the Communist army repeatedly approached, and the county magistrates of Gaoyou, Xinghua, Taiyu, and Tianchang counties all obeyed orders not to resist, and led the local people to flee to Yangzhou. Now, while comforting the exiled youth, they are re-planning reconstruction and re-rehabilitation, which is what is expected, but the exiled youth today look to their hometown with infinite pain.</p>
<p>Dikes to be Repaired</p>
<p>The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau is currently preparing to block the Shijiang dams that were opened last year, and plans to repair the Guazhou Dike project to prevent the summer and autumn Jiang tide from scouring the dike body, so as to avoid the farmland within the east and west dikes from being harmed. Moreover, because the mouth of the Yellow River has not been blocked, if the Huai River rises sharply and the Yellow River floods, the canal cannot accommodate it, and the counties in the lower river will become a swamp. Therefore, the Bureau plans to apply to the Relief Administration for funds to carry out various projects.</p>
<p>Highway Improvement</p>
<p>From Liuwei on the edge of the Yangtze River to Yangzhou, there are more than ten kilometers of highway. Before the war, there were connecting buses, which were very convenient. Now, it is replaced by a reconstructed coal-powered car from 1920. Repairs have been stopped along the way, and passengers also have to ride on the roof. It is hoped that the highway authorities will find a way to improve it. The Yangtai Highway is barely passable. Yangzhou north to Shaobo, Gaoyou, Qingjiang and other places, it is better to use civilian ships. Recently, the Highway Administration has sent personnel to inspect and will immediately formulate a repair plan and engage in repairs.</p>
<p>Educational Rehabilitation</p>
<p>Before the war, the degree of Yangjin was praised by the academic circles of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After the War of Resistance, either due to environmental pressure, it moved inland, or it was temporarily suspended due to the occupation of school buildings. The American Chinese Middle School, which is run by the church, has had its school buildings occupied by the Japanese invaders and changed into a concentration camp for foreigners. It has now been taken back and officially started classes. The male and female primary and secondary schools run by the Catholic Church are trying their best to maintain the status quo. The provincial and county middle schools have also been relocated from the inland. It is hoped that the educational authorities will step up rehabilitation guidance work to improve the educational and cultural level of northern Jiangsu. (2, 3.)</p>

<h3>A Moving Scene in Xinxiang</h3>
<p>Editor: This is a recent moving scene in Xinxiang. I am from Qinyang, and I will record the true situation I witnessed. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Communist army captured Qinyang, Boai, Wenmeng, and Chou counties in northern Henan and called them "Liberated Areas." The people in the "Liberated Areas" could not bear the oppression and fled to Kaifeng and Xinxiang, becoming exiles with no place to live, in a very miserable situation. After the Xinxiang team of the Mediation Executive Department returned to Xinxiang for the second time, more than a thousand male and female people's representatives from Qinyi and Chuan counties marched in Xinxiang in teams on the afternoon of February 6 to petition, shouting slogans on the road such as "We don't want to be prisoners in the Liberated Area," "The Liberated Area is a big prison," and "We firmly oppose dividing northern Henan into the Liberated Area." After reaching the door of the three-person team, they requested that the representatives meet with them. Only government representatives politely persuaded the public to go back at the door. When the people heard the sound, they knelt down, prostrated themselves on the ground and cried bitterly, calling out "We want to go home," "Please the Eighth Route Army hurry up and withdraw from Qinyang Boai" and "Please the Central Army open west to recover Qinyang." The local people who watched also shed tears because of the moving situation. After many persuasion, the crying was slightly smaller, but the tears did not stop. They gradually stood up and still gathered and did not disperse. The writer quietly asked an old man who was nearly seventy years old why he was petitioning. According to him, "I am from Dongguan, Boai. I am sixty-six years old this year, and I only have one son named Ma Changshan. After the Eighth Route Army captured Boai, they only said that they would organize the militia. Who knew that when attacking Qinyang City, the militia was also opened. They didn't give my son a gun, but asked him to carry a ladder, and he lost his life in vain." After saying that, he choked and could not make a sound. A twelve-year-old girl asked another person who was asking with tears, "My dad was caught by the Eighth Route Army and insisted that he was a Kuomintang, and he was shot in Qinyang!" I interrupted and asked him what his dad did? She said, "He fought guerrillas with the brigade commander (that is, the current commander of the security brigade, Li Zongji - the author), and I don't know what he did. My mother is half crazy with anxiety, and my third uncle took us out." Saying that, the people, after being persuaded, cried out in unison, "Please the three-person team uphold justice and let us go home." The public gradually went west. The writer witnessed the suffering of the elders in his hometown, and when he returned home, he had thousands of thoughts in his heart. Without realizing it, he wrote these few words that are not well-written with tears, and asked to publish them. Sincerely, Xinxiang Chen Ping.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Twelfth Anniversary of the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>Today marks the twelfth anniversary of the New Life Movement. As we commemorate this anniversary during a time of national restoration and initial construction, reflecting on the past and planning for the future holds profound significance. Chairman Chiang initiated the New Life Movement twelve years ago, originally to address contemporary issues and urge us to adopt strict discipline in our daily lives to invigorate ourselves and strive for strength. Since the Xinhai Revolution, followed by the May Fourth New Culture Movement, under the slogan of overthrowing the "Confucius Shop," our inherent excellent traditions have often been neglected and self-despised. The moral values inherent in our nation have gradually declined. Simultaneously, the people have become accustomed to leisure and inaction, leading to scattered behavior and a lack of self-motivation. Chairman Chiang's advocacy of the New Life Movement aimed to restore our inherent moral order and discipline while encouraging individuals to invigorate and reform their personal lives. This was truly a potent remedy for saving our national customs. A nation is composed of countless individuals. Without reform in personal lives, how can the nation be reformed, and how can our nation join the ranks of modern nations? Some believe that the New Life should embody new morals, not merely restoring traditional virtues. However, moral values are timeless. The moral principles followed by our ancestors do not change their value with the passage of time. How to uphold our inherent moral values to adapt to our current new era and new life should be the primary task of the New Life Movement. This is the most fundamental task in our great nation-building endeavor. We can catch up in all material constructions, but if the personal lives of our people are not thoroughly reformed, it will be like building skyscrapers on a sandy beach, inevitably collapsing. Therefore, the widespread implementation of the New Life Movement is essential for nation-building, which is self-evident.</p>
<p>Twelve years is not a short time. After twelve years of promoting the New Life Movement, we cannot deny its achievements, but the desired outcomes have not been fully realized. Today, compared to twelve years ago, have we seen any real changes in the lives of our citizens? Have our personal lives been invigorated? The lack of punctuality remains, and the lack of self-motivation in personal lives persists. Today, after twelve years, how is it any different from the beginning? Occasionally, when we reflect, we cannot help but feel deeply moved. The number of organizations promoting the New Life is not small nationwide, and the funds spent on promoting the New Life Movement over the past twelve years are considerable. However, why are the results so limited?</p>
<p>First, it is because we have failed to practice what we preach. If those who are engaged in promoting the New Life Movement in various regions do not set a good example in their personal lives and lead by example, how can we expect the movement they are promoting to be effective? To promote the New Life Movement, slogans are posted, instructing people not to take cars or sedan chairs but to develop the habit of walking. Yet, those in charge of promotion in various regions may still use cars and sedan chairs. How can this be an effective promotion? Only when those promoting the New Life Movement in various regions personally practice the rules of the New Life can we expect it to be effective.</p>
<p>Second, we feel that it is difficult to express, but the rules of conduct set by the New Life Movement are too strict. If they are too strict, they are difficult to follow. Yet, we cannot but follow them, leading to superficial compliance and an increase in hypocrisy. This has a very negative impact on the general public's understanding of the New Life Movement. For example, smoking and drinking are prohibited by the New Life Movement. While tobacco and alcohol are indeed harmful habits, individuals have the freedom to choose. If an individual enjoys drinking, they should be able to have a drink with a few good friends during their leisure time, as long as it is done in moderation and does not lead to drunkenness or disturbance, which is not harmful to moral values or to the necessity of life. While this is not ideal, it does not need to be strictly prohibited. The New Life Movement explicitly prohibits these behaviors, leading to situations in some regions where the New Life Movement is implemented where restaurants are not allowed to sell alcohol openly, but people drink alcohol under the pretense of drinking tea, which is nothing more than self-deception. This has a significantly negative impact. The promotion of the New Life Movement originally aimed to make people understand propriety and shame and invigorate their personal lives. If the result of the promotion is to encourage people to be hypocritical and deceitful, does it not contradict Chairman Chiang's original intention in initiating the New Life Movement?</p>
<p>During his visit to Shanghai, Chairman Chiang, in his address to the public at the welcome rally at the racecourse, earnestly encouraged the public to restore inherent morality and practice the New Life. This demonstrates how much importance Chairman Chiang places on the promotion of the New Life Movement. Chairman Chiang said: "I believe that the most important thing for nation-building and safeguarding independence and freedom in the future is to restore China's inherent morality, develop our new spirit of nation-building, and practice our new life to change the numb and sluggish atmosphere. Every one of our compatriots must understand propriety, know shame, be responsible, and abide by discipline. The reason why our allied nations such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France have become so powerful is entirely due to the high moral standards of their people, who are able to automatically take responsibility for the nation, abide by discipline, and be selfless in public. If we want to stand in equality with our allied nations in independence and freedom, we must love our country, have the same morality, and have the same spirit as they do... only then can we stand among the modern nations and societies. Therefore, as I said before, the promotion of the New Life Movement is the most fundamental work in our nation-building efforts. The lack of effectiveness in the past promotion of the New Life Movement makes us aware of the need for vigilance in the future promotion of the New Life Movement. As we commemorate the twelfth anniversary of the New Life Movement, I would like to offer some observations on the future development of the New Life Movement:</p>
<p>First, the New Life Movement primarily aims to restore our nation's inherent morality and enable us to be responsible and disciplined in our daily lives. It seems appropriate to revise the rules regarding personal life, which are too strict, so that this fundamental movement of nation-building can be universally implemented without adverse effects. If it is too strict, it is difficult to implement. To make the New Life Movement practical for the general public, the limits of personal freedom must be relaxed. Actions that do not conflict with inherent morality should not be strictly prohibited. If we are too focused on minor details, the further we promote it, the further we will be from the purpose of the promotion. Given the lack of effectiveness in the past promotion of the New Life Movement, this point deserves special attention.</p>
<p>Second, we want to point out that restoring inherent morality is not about returning to the past but about innovation. Morality is timeless, as we have already said, and there is no difference between Chinese and foreign morality. Moral values are universal. Although foreign languages may not have the exact equivalents of our words "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame," foreign behavior is still guided by these principles. In his address to the public at the racecourse, Chairman Chiang taught us to learn from their moral spirit, which shows that restoring inherent morality is not about blindly returning to the past. Western moral spirit, including that of the Soviet Union, is deeply intertwined with Christianity. In addition to moral principles, they also have religious principles to regulate their behavior. The New Life Movement focuses on restoring inherent morality, and perhaps a new driving force is needed for its implementation. In our country, Chinese morality and Christian morality can be said to be two sides of the same coin. To thoroughly learn from the Western moral spirit, we should also pay more attention to the Christian principles that form the backbone of Western civilization.</p>

<h3>Report on the Case of Lee Tze's Betrayal: Record of Yesterday Afternoon's Continued Hearing, Prosecution Requests Seizure of Defendant's Property</h3>
<p>New New Company Director and Several Others Summoned to Testify, Court Adjourns for Investigation and Reschedules Hearing for Debate</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Lee Tze case was reheard yesterday. Both lawyers hired by the defendant, Che Shih-chao and Chen Rui, were present. Sha Qianli, the legal advisor for the prosecution, was also present, but due to litigation regulations, he could not participate in the debate and merely sat in the audience, providing instructions. Both sides presented their statements yesterday and summoned a large number of witnesses, including Jin Zongcheng. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>At half past two, Court President Liu Yu-kuei, along with Judges Cao Jun and Cai Jin, prosecutors, clerks, and others, arrived in court. After Lee Tze was brought in, the clerk was ordered to read the defendant's recorded statement from the previous hearing. Lee was asked if there were any errors, and he proposed two corrections. Then, the recorded statements of the prosecutors from the previous hearing were read, and they all stated that they were accurate. At this point, the court asked Lee Tze if he had any comments. Lee stated: Before the war, the customs' fine for the New New Company was not due to tax evasion but a misunderstanding. Regarding the donation of the New New Glass Radio equipment to the enemy, it was forcibly taken over by the Japanese puppet regime, and New New was not the only company affected at the time. As for the underground work,</p>
<p>They say I bought it with money</p>
<p>I don't want to argue too much, the facts will prove themselves in the future, he said. Then, Shu Yue-qiao said: If Lee Tze claims to have made contributions and wants to escape punishment, then Wang Jingwei also made contributions to the Republic in the past. Moreover, the witnesses Lee mentioned are all related to him, he said. Another prosecutor, Han Wu-cheng, said: During Chairman's visit to Shanghai, the Shanghai cotton cloth industry was bought by the puppet merchants' association, and they specially published a newspaper to appeal to the Chairman for relief. This shows the harm of the puppet merchants' association. Lee was the one who initiated the organization of the merchants' association and was a preparatory committee member and elected as a director and proposal review committee member. He also participated in</p>
<p>The European banquet for the Japanese economic delegation</p>
<p>Ogura and others, which can all be proven by reports, he said. At the same time, he requested the court to (1) summon Kinoshita Yutaka, the Japanese advisor to the New New Company, (2) review the files and meeting minutes of the puppet merchants' association, (3) investigate the connection between the Jiang Gong-mei case and Lee Tze, (3) investigate the dismissal of Bi Gao-kui, the inspector-general of the Garrison Command, and the reprimand of Cheng Yi-ming, the director of the investigation office, and the connection with the Lee Tze case, (5) immediately seize Lee Tze's property, and (6) inquire with the Public Utilities Bureau about the license number of Lee Tze's puppet merchants' association vehicle. At this point, lawyer Chen Ting-rui stood up and said: Last time, we asked the court to send someone to investigate the relevant accounts with both parties. The defendant has now had Pan Xulun, a certified public accountant from Lixin Accounting Firm, audit the New New Company, the Sendai Iron Factory, the New Great Bank, the Shanghai Industrial Bank, the clearing house, and other various</p>
<p>Relevant accounts audited</p>
<p>And has a written report, which is hereby submitted. The court then questioned Jin Zongcheng, the chairman of the New New Company, who stated: I did introduce the Sendai Iron Factory to purchase New New Company's Water Gutter Iron at the time, but I did not know the purchase date and price, he said. Then, He Jia-liang, an employee of the New New Company, was asked, who stated: When selling the Water Gutter to Sendai, I weighed it at the entrance of the New New Hotel, and it was transported by charcoal truck, a total of more than 300 bundles. Fei Wei-zhi, a clerk at the Sendai Iron Factory, said: I went to the New New Company to transport and weigh it, and the truck was borrowed from Rongfeng Spinning Mill. Chen Fu-en, the driver of Rongfeng Spinning Mill, testified that it was true. At this point, Court President Liu immediately asked Tang Cheng-zhang, the business manager of the New New Company, and ordered him to sign in court to verify the signature on the relevant account books related to the sale of Water Gutter Iron. Lawyer Chen then presented a book of subpoenas and said: Tang's signature methods are different, which can be used for reference. After Court President Liu questioned Chen Yao-shu, the cashier of the New New Company, and shareholders Wang Tong-sheng and Wu Zhi, he asked Lee Tze again. Lee said: Jiang Gong-mei has nothing to do with me at all. Now that Jiang has been arrested, please investigate, he said. At this point, Court President Liu said: The prosecutors and defense lawyers have presented evidence in this case, which the court will deliberate and determine whether it is necessary to investigate. Han Wu-cheng then stood up again and said that Wang Sheng-mao, Huang Ke-wen, and Xu Ke-kang, employees of the New New Company who are not representatives of the prosecutors, can also testify to the enemy's use of military trucks to transport Water Gutter Iron to New New. He also said that there are more than 400 employees of the New New Company who can testify. Yu Geng-sheng then described how enemy military trucks arrived at New New to transport Water Gutter Iron. After the interrogation was complete, the court adjourned for investigation and rescheduled the hearing for debate.</p>
<h3>Two Traitor Cases Heard on the Same Day</h3>
<p>Two other traitor cases were heard yesterday morning, including (1) Gao Quan-sheng, a secret agent of the enemy's military police in Yangsiqiao, Pudong, with the victims Ding Wei-liang and Huang Hai-gen describing their victimization, (2) Chen You-tian, an intelligence officer of the puppet Pudong Security Brigade. Both cases were adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<p>The case of the Shen Wan-ling, the owner of the Shengsheng Ranch, accused of being a traitor by the ranch employees, will be heard at 9:30 a.m. today.</p>
<h3>Looking Forward to the Twelfth Anniversary of the New Life</h3>
<p>— Qian Da-jun</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang initiated the New Life Movement in Nanchang on February 19, 1934, twelve years have passed. Whether in China or abroad, whether in cities or villages, whether men, women, old, or young, everyone knows the term "New Life" Movement, and everyone says they want to practice the New Life. But in fact, how many people have truly practiced the New Life? Looking at the overall society and country, how much has the New Life Movement actually achieved? Over the past twelve years, the nation and people have faced the dangers of life and death, survival, and extinction. However, the government and society have been actively carrying out this work, because the "New Life Movement" is indeed a social movement and a movement for the nation to rise from the dead. If we examine the achievements of the past twelve years, they are of course far from ideal. However, we should clearly recognize that the main reason why the New Life Movement could not be widely and universally successful was, of course, due to the destruction and obstruction of Japanese imperialism. The second reason is that the intellectual, influential, and responsible leaders in society generally lacked a correct understanding and, even more so, lacked the determination to practice it themselves. The New Life Movement cannot succeed with slogans alone; it must be practiced by everyone, especially in China, where our compatriots suffer hardships and have limited knowledge, and it is essential for social leaders to promote it in order to achieve top-down effectiveness. The New Life Movement has perfect theories and good methods. If we can gather the strength of all parties to promote it, it will be a fundamental movement for building a new China!</p>
<p>A movement, an ideology, when we study it from the perspective of evolutionary change, we can know that it must have temporality and spatiality. Based on the principle that "truth fears no destruction," let us examine whether the theory of the New Life Movement is correct and whether it meets the needs of today's situation.</p>
<p>The New Life Movement promotes a disciplined life based on "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame." It is practiced in daily life—in the four aspects of "clothing, food, housing, and transportation." "Embodying propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" is the content of the New Life Movement. "Propriety" is a respectful attitude, "righteousness" is upright behavior, "integrity" is clear distinction, and "shame" is sincere awareness. If the true meaning of "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" can be clearly understood, I believe that no one will doubt or insult the New Life Movement. As for the relationship between "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" and society and the nation, let us refer to Chairman Chiang's explanation:</p>
<p>"Propriety is reason; reason in the natural world is called law; reason in society is called regulations; reason in the nation is called discipline. If people's behavior is guided by these three laws, it is called abiding by the rules. Any behavior that abides by the rules is called a respectful attitude.</p>
<p>"Righteousness is appropriateness; appropriateness is proper behavior. Behavior that follows propriety—that is, conforms to the laws of nature, social regulations, and national discipline—is called proper behavior. Improper behavior, or knowing what is proper and not doing it,</p>
<p>"Integrity is clarity; it means being able to distinguish between right and wrong. That which conforms to propriety and righteousness is right, and that which is contrary to propriety and righteousness is wrong. Knowing what is right and taking it, knowing what is wrong and abandoning it, is called clear distinction.</p>
<p>"Shame is knowledge; it means knowing to have a sense of shame and disgust. Behavior that does not conform to propriety, righteousness, and integrity, and feeling ashamed of it, is called shame. Behavior that does not conform to propriety, righteousness, and integrity, and becoming immersed in its shameful nature, is called disgust. However, the notion of shame and disgust is prone to excess or deficiency. Therefore, awareness must be sincere. Having a sincere sense of shame means striving for improvement, and having a sincere sense of disgust means striving to cleanse oneself. This is called sincere awareness.</p>
<p>From the above, "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" are truly the only regulations for society, groups, and the nation. "Behavior that is contrary to 'propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame' only serves to harm others with one's knowledge and skills, and ultimately cannot benefit oneself, only leading to failure. Therefore, 'propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame' can not only save the nation but also establish the nation." As Guan Zhong said, "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of the nation. If the four pillars are not upheld, the nation will decline and perish." The reason why Chairman Chiang wants to promote the New Life Movement is because "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" are not upheld in today's society. In today's Chinese society, the general mentality is complacency and weakness, which is manifested in behavior as a lack of distinction between public and private, and a lack of understanding of fundamentals and details. Officials are hypocritical and corrupt; the people are scattered and numb; the youth are degenerate and indulgent; adults are corrupt and mediocre; the rich are extravagant and superficial; and the poor are humble and chaotic. Although there has been much progress in the eight years of the war of resistance, countless cases of shamelessness, corruption, and perversion of justice continue to emerge, and national discipline and social order are difficult to establish. If this situation continues for a long time, the victory won by the blood and lives of tens of millions of soldiers and civilians will be in vain. China has today entered the ranks of the four great powers, and not only must we seek clarity and efficiency in politics, but we must also strive for soundness in society, because a democratic country is based on the people as the foundation of the nation, and the strength of society can determine political reform. If China is to revive and become a prosperous and strong country, it must rebuild social morality and transform the national psychology, and the New Life Movement is precisely a movement created to address the ills of the old Chinese society; therefore, the New Life Movement is essential for China and must continue to be promoted. We hope that all sectors of the country will unanimously recognize the goal and earnestly do their best to fulfill our mission of creating a new society and a new country!</p>
<h3>US Military Continues Trial of Japanese War Criminals; General Chennault Also Attends Hearing; Defendant Pleads for Release, Claiming No Involvement in Killings</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, Flying Tiger General Chennault, accompanied by Colonel Shu Boyan, Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Aviation Commission, attended the US military tribunal at Tilanqiao Prison to hear the case of the killing of American pilots. According to the record, the three young pilots who were brutally murdered were pilots of the 14th Air Force under General Chennault's command. After the American side learned that their pilots were killed on the 16th, they launched a major bombing of Hankou on the 10th of that month in retaliation. At that time, many innocent Chinese people in Hankou were also killed. Yesterday, Lieutenant Colonel Weiss, the prosecuting attorney, completed reading aloud the collected evidence of the crimes of the defendants. Lieutenant Colonel Harkins and Major Li Weiyun, the defense attorneys, then took the stand to speak and presented various reasons requesting the release of Sergeant Yamaguchi Kyukichi, Tsukada Kōkichi, Takeuchi Yoshiyuki, Fujita Jun'ichi, and Mizuta Yu, all of the 34th Army, stating that they only followed orders from their superiors to execute everything and did not participate in the killings. However, Lieutenant Colonel Weiss, the prosecuting attorney, rebutted, arguing that in law, all accomplices are guilty. Therefore, the five men's request for release was denied. Afterwards, the defense attorneys requested the release of Manabe Ryoichi, an official of the Japanese Consulate in Hankou, Hamada Shohei, a consular police officer, and Kato Takumi, a member of the youth corps, stating that they served in the consulate and were not involved in the matter and should not be convicted. This was also rejected. At noon, both sides' lawyers questioned Major General Kaburaki Masao, Colonel Sakai Sadaji, and Fujii Tsutomu, which lasted for two hours.</p>

<h3>Former Deputy Director of the French Concession Police Arrested; Aminov Accused of Assisting the Enemy and Puppets in Persecuting Patriots</h3>
<p>Aminov, who once served as the Deputy Director of the Police Department of the French Concession, has been arrested by our military authorities a few days ago, following Sari, on suspicion of assisting the enemy and puppets in gathering military intelligence and killing patriotic individuals during the Anti-Japanese War. He has been handed over to the court and will be publicly tried.</p>
<p>It is learned that Aminov, also known as George, is 49 years old, originally from White Russia and later naturalized as a French citizen. During the Tsarist Russian era, he served as the head of the Royal Detective Corps. In 1922, he joined the French Concession Police as a detective in the Criminal Division, and was subsequently promoted to translator, head of the Political Affairs Section, chief inspector, and</p>
<p>Head of the Political Affairs Section</p>
<p>After the enemy forces invaded the Concession, he was appointed director of the Baojia Office (Neighborhood Watch) and once served as Deputy Director. It is said that at this time, Aminov colluded with Sari to persecute patriotic individuals, and it is rumored that the Japanese government awarded him a medal for this. Our authorities arrested Aminov at his residence on Hongqiao Road a week ago and</p>
<p>Filed public charges for war crimes.</p>
<p>It is reported that during the military tribunal's interrogation, Aminov firmly denied receiving a medal from the Japanese government. He also claimed to be unaware of Sari's various crimes and stated that he himself was on the Japanese blacklist.</p>
<h3>Sufficient Grain Reserves in the City; Authorities to Further Smooth Supply Channels</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Grain Administration Commissioner's Office, the city currently has ample rice reserves, and the autumn harvest in various places last year was also good. Therefore, he is very optimistic about the future of the city's grain administration. It is estimated that the current grain reserves in the city are six to eight times higher than the reserves in September last year. Only 30% of the abundant harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces last autumn has been sold. Therefore, the reasons for the current rise in rice prices in the city are nothing more than: (1) the general rise in commodity prices; (2) the rise in rice prices in the producing areas; (3) hoarding and speculation by speculators. He stated that the city's rice reserves were already sufficient, and now they will continue to smooth supply channels to rationalize the price of rice in the city. The office also plans to support rice merchants by finding ways to obtain mortgage loans from banks and the government to facilitate rice merchants' funding and facilitate the purchase and transportation of rice to Shanghai. Since the victory, the office has actively assisted various rice trade associations and rice shops in resuming business, and the number of rice shops has increased from 200 to 16,000.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute in Cotton and Wool Textile Industry; Mediation Shows Signs of Progress</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] After more than 7,700 employees of nine factories, including the Yong'an, Xinhe, Baofeng, and Shenxin cotton and wool textile factories, began a work slowdown on the 16th, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Li Jianhua, convened labor and management for mediation on the following day. The 12 demands raised by the labor side covered a wide range, making it difficult to reach an agreement immediately. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting with the management of 43 factories yesterday. According to Director Li, the focus of the dispute is the underpaid wages for November and December of last year after calculating the cost of living index. Most other issues are easier to resolve. If the negotiations at 2:00 PM this afternoon are successful, then work can fully resume tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Gas Company Employees Demand Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>Employees of the Shanghai Gas Company submitted 19 demands to the company at the end of last year, requesting improved treatment, and requested mediation from the Social Affairs Bureau. At that time, the Social Affairs Bureau was busy dealing with other more serious labor disputes, so it has not yet formally mediated. After repeated urging from the labor side, the Social Affairs Bureau decided to convene labor and management at 10:00 AM on the 20th of this month to discuss solutions.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Sir Horace James Seymour, the British Ambassador to China, and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon by special plane from Chongqing. They will stay in Shanghai for a week.</p>
<h3>Cook Executed Yesterday for Armed Robbery</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Command Headquarters of the Third Front Army, on the evening of September 8 last year, bandit leader Wang Zhonghua gathered more than 30 people and robbed more than ten families in Tangqiao Town, Pudong, and fled after dividing the loot. Subsequently, the 94th Army captured a bandit named Gu Huaiyi, a cook from Yangzhou, and presented him to the Third Front Army Command Headquarters. After interrogation, he confessed without reservation. The suspect dared to carry out robberies in towns, so he was sentenced to death by the Army Headquarters in accordance with the law. Yesterday, the suspect was identified and executed by firing squad at the execution ground on Song Park Road in Northern Fujian as a warning.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Work Slowdown by Employees of the Four Banks and One Bureau; Partial Favorable Response to Advance Subsidy Request</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The employees of the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and the Four Banks and the Central Trust Bureau, held a two-hour work slowdown last Saturday from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM due to the failure to obtain advance subsidies. The Four Banks Joint Office held an emergency meeting at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday to address this issue. In addition to the persons in charge of the Four Banks and One Bureau, Mayor Qian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, and Director of the Police Bureau Xuan Tiewu were also present. After several discussions, opinions from all parties failed to converge. Finally, through the efforts of Song Hanzhang, Xu Jilun, and others, the employees' demands were fully accepted, that is, before the official adjustment plan is decided, the subsidy for February will be advanced to each employee at 150,000 yuan and to each worker at 110,000 yuan, which will be deducted from the new subsidy after adjustment. The advance subsidy has already begun to be issued yesterday. It is reported that the adjustment requirements put forward by the employees are that the minimum total salary and subsidy for employees should be 156,000 yuan per month, and the minimum total salary and subsidy for workers should be 117,000 yuan per month.</p>

<h3>Incident Involving Passengers on the Yongsheng Steamer</h3>
<p>Ministry of Economic Affairs personnel assaulted and insulted; luggage thrown into the river, culprits not caught</p>
<p>The Yongsheng Steamer of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., managed by the Far East Shipping Manager's Office in the UK, transported relief supplies to Qingdao and returned to Shanghai. It was then assigned to transport relief supplies to Tianjin. It was originally scheduled to depart the day before yesterday, but due to delays in loading and unloading cargo, it was postponed to yesterday afternoon. Shanghai-Tianjin sea routes are scarce, making travel inconvenient. After the steamer announced its voyage to Tianjin, passengers flocked to purchase tickets. Yesterday morning, the steamer moved from the Yitaixing Wharf in Pudong to the Swire Wharf in Xin Kai River to allow passengers to board and depart. There were 30 personnel from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, led by Captain Sun Qifan, traveling to Tianjin to then proceed to the Northeast to take over industrial assets. Around 7:00 AM, the team hired a vehicle to load their luggage and arrived at the wharf. They saw that the ship and wharf were crowded with passengers boarding continuously, and there was no room to stand on the deck or the walkways on both sides of the cargo hold. Due to the large number of people and luggage, the team could not find a place to settle down. The captain negotiated with the purser, Mr. Xu, and was allowed to huddle on the walkways on both sides of the officer's cabin, placing some of their luggage in the cabin. Around 11:30 AM, before the ship was about to set sail, two British sailors (resembling soldiers) entered and, for unknown reasons, suddenly started punching and kicking wildly, injuring several people. Fortunately, the injuries were minor and did not require medical treatment. The team was also present and several people stepped forward to dissuade them, but they were also beaten. The sailors also threw the team's luggage into the Huangpu River. The team immediately went ashore to call the police. Subsequently, the Shui Shang Police Sub-bureau of the 16th Precinct dispatched several police officers to accompany them. The two assaulting sailors were taken to the police station, along with a higher-ranking British soldier. After reconciliation at the police station, they all returned to the ship. Unexpectedly, the British sailors' attitude changed again after returning to the ship, and the team could no longer tolerate it. They immediately reported to the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and reported to the Shui Shang Police Sub-bureau again. After the police sub-bureau notified the captain, the ship could not set sail until the above dispute was resolved. The Special Commissioner's Office then sent Zhu Fukuang to the ship to negotiate with the captain, and the Shui Shang Police Sub-bureau also sent personnel to assist. By 5:30 PM, the captain agreed to let the team stay in the dining room in front of the officer's cabin, and the incident came to an end. The ship is scheduled to depart for Tianjin at 4:00 AM this morning. As for the luggage that was thrown away, only one piece has been recovered. It is said that two pieces are still missing, one of which may be official documents and is very important. Negotiations will continue regarding the lost items.</p>
<h3>Memorial for Zhang Yongchun; Friends Set Up Altar for Remembrance</h3>
<p>Zhang Yongchun, a member of the Shanghai Special City Party Committee, was arrested by the Japanese Kempeitai during the Anti-Japanese War in 1944 and suffered severe torture in prison. After being released that year, he eventually died of his injuries on February 19. Today is the second anniversary of Zhang's death. Comrades and friends in the city have set up an altar at the Danjing Temple at the intersection of Xiai Xians Road and Jin Shenfu Road to commemorate the martyr and console his loyal spirit.</p>
<h3>Women's Contribution to the Nation Should Be Equal to Men's; Madame Chiang Kai-shek Discusses Her Impressions of Her Trip to the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Reported by Our Reporter, Mai Tian</p>
<p>"Many people often overlook the status and importance of housewives. In fact, this is a mistake. The responsibilities of housewives are very important, especially during the Anti-Japanese War. They not only had to take care of their husbands and children and manage the household, but also constantly helped their husbands with their work. Their contribution to the nation is really equal to that of their husbands." Madame Chiang told us this yesterday afternoon when she received reporters. If we want to give an example, Madame Chiang herself is the best example.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the reporters had the special opportunity to be received by Madame Chiang at the Kong Residence on Xiai Xians Road, even though she was not feeling well. She spent 40 minutes talking to us, and we felt very grateful and apologetic.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang was wearing a dark blue floral silk long-sleeved qipao, black high heels, and black earrings. Upon entering the living room, she warmly shook hands with each of the reporters and asked about them kindly. During the conversation, she smiled and called the reporters "children" from time to time.</p>
<p>Northeast Compatriots Are Excellent</p>
<p>When the reporters asked Madame Chiang about her impressions of the Northeast compatriots when she was in the Northeast, Madame Chiang spoke with a local accent, saying that she had a very good impression of the Northeast compatriots. When she arrived in Changchun, local residents braved the snow to welcome her at the airport, which moved her very much. But she found that the Northeast compatriots had indeed been oppressed by the Japanese. When she gave a speech at the conference, the crowd applauded enthusiastically. When the commander on stage ordered them to stop so that she could continue her speech, the entire audience immediately stopped applauding after the commander raised his hand. This was not like free people gradually and naturally stopping clapping. "The compatriots in the Northeast are very excellent. They are an oppressed people, not an organized people. If we can educate them and organize them well, the future will be very promising," Madame Chiang continued.</p>
<p>Do More to Serve Us</p>
<p>Madame Chiang was deeply moved by the many relatives, friends, and compatriots who had been displaced and died during the years of the Anti-Japanese War. She said, "People must have a broad vision, seek practicality, and should not only focus on the present. Life is short and fleeting like a dream, but precisely because it is short, we should strive to do something for the country and for mankind."</p>
<p>Madame Chiang is not only a leader in the women's world but also a good mother to children. As the Chairman of the Wartime Children's Relief Association, she has accommodated 30,000 orphans in the past few years. She has made the greatest efforts to raise funds and plan work for them.</p>
<p>Next, the reporters raised the following questions to Madame Chiang:</p>
<p>Q: "How will women's elections be stipulated when the National Assembly is convened in the future?"</p>
<p>A: "I don't think there should be any restrictions on women participating in the general election. Their qualifications to be elected and to vote are the same as men's."</p>
<p>Q: "What are Madame Chiang's opinions on women working in society and the unequal status of women?"</p>
<p>A: "I cannot understand why women cannot have a place in society. Women are also equal citizens. Although our experience may not be as much as men's, in fact, women can endure hardship more than men. But women themselves should also respect their own personality and not engage in behaviors that are despised by men. As for women being fired because they are married, this is also very unreasonable. As long as she has the ability to work, or her children are grown up and do not need to be taken care of all day long, she can of course continue to serve in society. It all depends on the individual's situation and environment."</p>
<p>Views on Clothing Issues</p>
<p>Madame Chiang was very happy to talk to us, so we changed the topic.</p>
<p>Q: "Madame Chiang has not returned to Shanghai for more than eight years. Now that she has come here, what are her feelings about the clothing of Shanghai women?"</p>
<p>A: "I really didn't see any new clothes. I heard that short qipaos are popular now. My clothes are the same as they were eight years ago, and I don't know what the most fashionable styles are. I always hear that high-shoulder qipaos are popular, but I haven't even seen them. I still like to wear long qipaos, and I always wear silk-cotton robes in cold weather. I am very afraid of the cold, and silk-cotton robes are much warmer. I think the most fashionable clothes are those that are good for your health."</p>
<p>Q: "What are Madame Chiang's usual hobbies?"</p>
<p>A: "I used to love horseback riding, playing golf, and playing tennis, but now there is no opportunity at all. I always thought I could rest after the victory, but in fact, it's impossible. But we should still do more when we can." Madame Chiang also said: "I also often like to take walks, and I like classical music. I really hope that when Shanghai's symphony orchestra performs, it can be broadcast for free by radio, like in foreign countries, so that everyone can hear it.</p>
<p>Most Favors Deep Blue</p>
<p>Q: "What is Madame Chiang's favorite color?"</p>
<p>A: "I like deep blue and black."</p>
<p>Someone came in to report that the time was up, so we had to stand up and say goodbye. Before leaving, Madame Chiang expressed her approval and satisfaction with women working in the news industry. She earnestly encouraged us, saying: "I hope that you can work hard in the newspaper not only for your career but also for the country and for mankind."</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Heating Up Again; Authorities Determined to Intensify Crackdown</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai financial authorities dispatched police to clear the Securities Exchange on the morning of the 15th to combat speculation and crack down on the black market, thoroughly investigating the accounts of various firms and punishing any illegal business activities according to law, speculators have all disappeared. Yesterday morning, it was discovered that unscrupulous individuals were gathering and trading in the building again, resuming their old business, and the atmosphere became lively again. The authorities believe that this speculation endangers social security and affects price fluctuations. In the future, they will only intensify the crackdown according to the established policy and will never relax. They have already agreed with the security authorities to take effective countermeasures.</p>
<p>The Rectification Committee of the Shanghai Money Changers Association has issued a notice to its members, requiring them to comply with the authorities' policy of stabilizing finance and to ensure that no speculative behavior occurs in their business operations. Otherwise, the association will not provide protection.</p>

Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, a fire broke out in the furnace room due to carelessness in burning rice straw, affecting the building in front, where the Xuhui Theater performed Shaoxing opera. Suddenly, male and female spectators rushed out of the door, causing chaos.

<h3>Black Market Transactions: Gold and Banknotes Decline, Public Bonds Continue to Fall, Chinese Stocks Rebound</h3>
<p>Secret trading of gold bars continued yesterday, opening at 1.54 million, with extremely tight credit conditions. Sellers gradually pressured the price down to 1.45 million, with buyers still active, struggling around the 1.5 million mark. Banks from the north continued to unload gold. With rumors of account investigations targeting financial institutions, speculators lacked sources of funds. The overnight interest rate soared to 30%, creating a slight sense of panic. The price dropped to a low of 1.33 million, closing at 1.37 million at noon, a half-percent decrease from the previous Saturday. In the afternoon, prices fluctuated within the 1.4 million range. No official price was listed for refined gold. Silver was selling at 1,600, and silver dollars were offered at 8,120 yuan. Interest rates were briefly bid up to 30%, but the prevailing rate was between 20% and 25%.</p>
<p>The US dollar opened around 2,050 yuan, but weakened due to the influence of gold prices, trending downwards after reaching 2,080 yuan. It fell to 1,960 yuan before noon, hovering between 1,980 yuan and 2,000 yuan at noon, similar to the previous Saturday. The exchange rate against gold fluctuated from 730 yuan to 700 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong currency lacked demand, with newly issued notes being particularly weak. As a result, older notes remained stable while new notes experienced a half-percent decline.</p>
<p>There was some transfer of public bonds in the market. Class C bonds opened at 1,620 yuan, reaching a high of 1,720 yuan and a low of 1,450 yuan, closing at 1,500 yuan at noon. Class E bonds opened at 1,180 yuan, reaching a high of 1,250 yuan and a low of 1,020 yuan, eventually settling around 1,050 yuan. Miscellaneous bonds of Classes A, B, and D all remained around 1,000 yuan. Due to tight credit, sellers continued to cut prices, resulting in a further 10% drop compared to the previous Saturday.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks rebounded slightly due to efforts by trade associations to request the authorities to allow free trading. However, high prices were forced down by tight credit conditions, leading to continued selling. Yong Xin Yarn initially opened at 2,200 yuan in the morning, reaching a high of 2,300 yuan, but eventually closing at 2,050 yuan. Mei Ya opened at 1,750 yuan, reaching a high of 1,800 yuan, and closing at 1,550 yuan. Jing Fu fell from around 125 yuan to around 115 yuan. Overall, the results were half a percent better than the previous Saturday.</p>

Except for the buying price of British &amp; Chinese Corporation's "De Shao," all other prices were selling prices.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Yarn Sales: High List Prices for the Textile Construction Company</h3>
<p>The yarn market remained depressed yesterday. Yang Chu initially opened at a high price, with 20-count Double Horse yarn trading at 1.02 million, but sellers flooded the market, and it closed at 970,000. Many traders were forced to lower prices to sell due to tight credit. Sales were slow, and sentiment was neutral. Prices for various yarn counts decreased by about 50,000. At noon, the Textile Construction Company announced its list prices. It offered no sales of 42-count Qian yarn and 20-count yarn, which were in demand. However, 40-count Blue Phoenix single yarn was auctioned at 1.76 million, an increase of 90,000 from the previous period. Additionally, 60-count Sunlight Singed thread was also auctioned at a high price of 3.18 million. It was reported that few yarn traders bought yesterday, believing that the Textile Construction Company's auction prices were higher than the market.</p>
<h3>Slight Progress in Cotton Transactions</h3>
<p>First Transaction of Zhangde Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was some progress in spot cotton trading, with mixed results. The Textile Construction Company made some purchases, buying Zhangde cotton at 100,500 yuan, Mettling cotton at 89,000 yuan, and Nantong Taicang cotton at 74,000 yuan, all delivered to the factory. The internal price of Zhoupu Seed Cotton was 14,000 yuan. According to cotton traders, Zhangde cotton had been unavailable due to transportation disruptions, but supplies are expected to arrive in Shanghai continuously.

Mei Ya silk was bid at over 1.25 million per hundred, later trading at 1.19 million. Da Ge Bi crepe fell from 4,320 yuan to 4,220 yuan. Minsheng black crepe was 4,950 yuan per yard.</p>

Prices for all grains softened at the close.</p>
<h3>White Lead Wire Declines</h3>
<p>The price of lead wire has recently shown signs of decline, as a shipment of 50 tons from abroad has arrived and is expected to be gradually sold off, causing those holding inventory to become apprehensive and refrain from raising prices as they did previously.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Cotton cloth traders remained inactive, unable to push up prices, but local demand remained exceptionally strong.</p>
<p>The lumber market has been strong in the past week due to brisk sales both locally and in other ports, especially Liu'an and Liu'an plywood, which have seen sharp increases. The market situation remained quite stable yesterday.</p>
<p>Daily necessities, such as Solid Foundation scissors and soap, opened slightly weaker. Huang Xiang Mao continues to receive allocations from the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration, resulting in strong sales, increasing by 2,500 yuan compared to yesterday. Candles and matches remained stable.</p>
<p>For cigarettes, British American Tobacco's Old Knife brand sold well and enjoyed quiet profits. Except for a slight increase in Da Gao Rong cigarettes, Chinese factory cigarettes saw sluggish sales, with abundant market supply and slight price declines.</p>

<p>The market for industrial raw materials was flat and sluggish, with few transactions. The price of caustic soda remained stable due to conflicting rumors, leading buyers to take a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Rise in Various Locations</h3>

<h3>Broadcloth Sales are Strong, Especially Light Colors</h3>
<p>Wholesale and retail broadcloth transactions have seen increased interest due to rumors of favorable buying conditions and the upcoming spring season. Both local and foreign merchants have been actively making purchases. At the same time, businesses are replenishing inventory in the face of scarce supplies and strong sales. As a result, the market trend has been very prosperous. Standard prices, affected by shortages and continued increases in factory prices, as well as rising prices for white rice, gold, silk, yarn, and silk fabrics, have generally exceeded opening prices. Most owners are unwilling to sell, especially light-colored broadcloth, which is most popular.</p>
<h3>Weak Tea Market: Minhou Tea Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The tea market trend has shifted to a situation of "red tea weak, green tea strong." Sales of red tea varieties have gradually declined recently, with buyers hesitant. The goods held by small retailers are being sold off due to credit constraints. Therefore, the market atmosphere has reversed from its previous briskness and is gradually relaxing. The price of Taiwan black tea has even fallen below 60,000 yuan per dan. Qimen tea is showing obvious weakness and its future is uncertain. As for green tea, demand continues to be strong, with buyers absorbing supplies without hesitation. Sentiment remains positive. The Ping An Steamship Bureau's Da Hua Lun returned to Shanghai from Fuzhou yesterday, carrying 2,200 packages of tea, 400 packages of sugar, and 2,400 packages of salt.</p>
<h3>Large Shipment of American Wheat Continues to Arrive</h3>

The company's William J. Duae arrived from Qinhuangdao yesterday, carrying over 6,000 tons of coal.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 15th) The Bank of China recently received instructions from the Ministry of Finance that because the crowds of buyers were causing disorder and making it impossible to maintain order in the Bank's entrusted gold trading, all gold trading procedures would be re-examined by the Ministry of Finance. Before the review is completed, trading should be temporarily suspended, and all customers registered on the 12th, whether they had drawn a number or not, should wait for instructions from the Executive Yuan. The sudden tightening of credit in Chongqing has eased as a result. It is reported that the liquid capital gathered in the Bank of China from various places at the moment is single-handedly facilitating manganese production.</p>
<p>The Guizhou Provincial Government has lifted the wartime ban on manganese production transactions, which is now applicable to buying and selling in the province. However, approval from the authorities is still required to export manganese.</p>

The fundraising principle will be to rely mainly on voluntary donations.</p>
<h3>Educational Facilities in Recovered Areas Suffer Extremely Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Submitting a Request for Assistance to the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Regarding the local education funds for the provinces and cities in the recovered areas, the Ministry of Education submitted a request in November of last year for the allocation of emergency measures funds, and the Executive Yuan allocated 1.1 billion yuan, which was distributed to the provinces to meet urgent needs. However, the damage to schools in the provinces is severe, making the allocation a drop in the bucket. Schools were mostly moved to the countryside during the war, and now plan to move back, but most of the original school buildings have been destroyed and cannot be used. Renting civilian housing is also impossible. Library equipment has suffered severe losses after repeated relocations. Although the situation in each province is not entirely the same, according to a survey by the Ministry of Education, 31 colleges and universities in 16 provinces and 5 cities (including Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Jehol, Chahar, Suiyuan, Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, and Qingdao) have suffered damage in almost all cases. Of the 2,676 secondary schools, 1,861 have been damaged. Of the 206,704 elementary schools, 118,663 have been damaged. During the rehabilitation period, large sums of money will be needed for the repair of school buildings and the replenishment of equipment. It is reported that Hunan Province alone needs more than 570 billion yuan, which is a very serious situation.

They are now submitting requests to the Ministry of Education to find solutions.</p>

The Ministry of Education has stipulated that students from enemy and puppet colleges and universities may register with the Teacher Appraisal Committee in each recovered area. After being approved for registration, students must submit reports on their studies of Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the book "China's Destiny," along with a thesis on their specialized subjects. After passing the review, the Ministry will issue a certificate recognizing their qualifications. Those who fail the review will be allowed to take the entrance examination for equivalent schools and grades.</p>

<h3>The New Life Movement and Education</h3>
<p>— Gu Yuxiu</p>
<p>The New Life Movement has been underway for twelve years since its inception. Within these twelve years, it has endured eight years of the War of Resistance. Therefore, the New Life Movement holds immense power and success for the victory of the War of Resistance. Now that the enemy has surrendered, the War of Resistance is victorious, and after the completion of the takeover, we are engaged in construction. Today, we celebrate the twelfth anniversary of the New Life Movement, reflecting on past work and planning further advancements.</p>
<p>In essence, the New Life Movement is a revolution of the lifestyle of our entire nation. It employs the simplest and most urgent methods to eliminate the habits of our citizens that are incompatible with the times and unsuitable for the environment, guiding them towards a lifestyle that suits the times and environment. In other words, it seeks to rationalize the lives of the people, using the inherent virtues of the Chinese nation, "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame," as the foundation, practicing them in the four aspects of daily life: "food, clothing, housing, and transportation." Today's China is a China victorious in the War of Resistance, and also a China striving for construction. Therefore, the lives of all citizens should be even more suited to the times and the environment, invigorate new spirits, engage in production and construction, and permanently stand shoulder to shoulder with the great powers.</p>
<p>The method of promoting the New Life Movement should begin with teaching, followed by inspection. Therefore, education and the New Life Movement are closely related.</p>
<p>Teachers at all levels of schools, whether in the classroom or during extracurricular activities, should teach students the main points and content of the New Life Movement using various methods. They should also lead by example, serving as role models for students. This will cultivate citizens who deeply understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and who can demonstrate these virtues in their daily lives of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. As for the general public, we should implement social education to promote the New Life Movement. Establishing public education centers, libraries, museums, gymnasiums, holding music performances, art exhibitions, and staging educational dramas and films can certainly enable the public to increase their knowledge, maintain good health, eliminate old habits, and cultivate a virtuous life. Therefore, as we celebrate the twelfth anniversary of the New Life Movement today, we realize that educational undertakings are indeed an important way to promote the New Life Movement.</p>
<h3>Basketball League Last Night: Renyu Defeats Xingzhong</h3>
<p>Women's Group V Team Wins, Shantou Team Sacko Postponed</p>

<h3>Dare Not</h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>There are several unique local dialects in Shaanxi that are very refined, beautiful in expression, and full of wisdom. "Dare not" is one of them.</p>
<p>If you go to a shop to buy something and want to reduce the price or get a discount, the shopkeeper will smile and answer you, "Dare not sell." This is much more tactful and generous than the Sichuanese shop's "Cannot," the Jiangsu and Zhejiang shop's "Cannot succeed," and the Tianjin shop's "No way."</p>
<p>If you negotiate with a rickshaw puller and the fare differs greatly, the puller will also sincerely respond with a "Dare not pull!" as if telling you that the "strength" of the laborer cannot be devalued! Very humble, yet very self-respecting.</p>
<p>Even when you ask, "Sir, is your surname Zhou, as in Zhou Wenwang?" the Shaanxi person will repeatedly reply with a look of fear and surprise, "Dare not surname! Dare not surname!"</p>
<p>Although "Dare not" may have actually become a "business tactic" and "polite phrase," the original meaning of "Dare not" is still valuable.</p>
<p>Dare not means prudence, thoughtfulness, restraint, simplicity, and careful consideration.</p>
<p>Life has many aspects, and I very much agree that we should all be "able to dare," but I would also prefer that we be "dare not" people at the same time. True "able to dare" always includes "dare not"; otherwise, it will lead you down a hooligan-like path, acting recklessly at every opportunity.</p>
<p>An "able to dare" boxer dares not strike casually, dares not sell dog-skin plaster everywhere.</p>
<p>An "able to dare" orator dares not open his mouth easily; his speech drafts are often more elaborate than those of a novice.</p>
<p>An "able to dare" author dares not produce shoddy work. Gorky's "Mother" was revised five times before being submitted.</p>
<p>An "able to dare" doctor dares not make a diagnosis lightly. The famous surgeon Miller once said, "Sometimes I almost dare not see patients; I am always afraid of being wrong."</p>
<p>An "able to dare" politician dares not be stubborn, dares not be selfish, dares not take risks casually, dares not ignore the trends of the people.</p>
<p>"Dare not" is not cowardice; "Dare not" is stability.</p>
<p>Thinking of myself, I should know what "dare not" to do. Looking at others, I hope they know what "dare not" to do. Otherwise, listening to the voices of the masses, shouldn't we dare not to "dare not" anymore?</p>
<p>Don't ever think that "Dare not" is something ugly, unlucky, or embarrassing. "Dare not" is indeed an unparalleled beauty.</p>
<p>International</p>
<h3>European Federation</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>It is said that U.S. President Truman is currently considering organizing a European federation. This federation may not be exactly the same as the U.S. federal system, but within this federation, the currency system will be uniform, tariffs will be unified, all resources will be jointly developed, and waterways will be publicly utilized. This federation will bring peace, stability, and prosperity to Europe. Truman has discussed this matter with his confidants, but he has not kept it a secret. He mentioned this idea at the Potsdam Conference, where he strongly advocated "unrestricted public use" of the Rhine, Danube, Black Sea Strait, Kiel Canal, and internal rivers that divide European countries. In his report attending this conference, he even stated frankly that the United States will continue to work to realize this proposal in the future.</p>
<p>The reason why President Truman wants to adopt this policy is simple. Although the United States intends to help Europe recover, Europe must make its own efforts to recover internally. If Europe wants to recover, tariff competition, trade restrictions, currency chaos, etc., must first be eliminated, so that commodity exchange and industrial areas can supply all products.</p>
<p>For example, Norway now desperately needs salt to preserve fish, and Italy desperately needs fish, but the two countries cannot trade. Greece is maliciously isolated by neighboring countries and cannot sell its tobacco, while other countries cannot even find cigarette butts. The Ruhr and Saar regions, Silesia, and Dessau have abundant coal reserves, but the local people cannot eat or wear coal. At the same time, Denmark, Hungary, and the Netherlands are rich in food, and the local people want to exchange food for coal, but the two regions cannot trade. The coal-producing areas have to starve, and the Danes, Dutch, and Hungarians have to endure the cold. President Truman advocates creating a European federation for another reason: European countries must eliminate their suspicions, eliminate their hatred, and unite as one family; otherwise, there will inevitably be an arms race. All resources will be consumed in preparing for war, resulting in hardship for the people and perhaps another even more terrible war.</p>
<p>Speaking of the European federation, this idea is not new. In the nineteenth century, many visionary people, such as Mazzini, Garibaldi, and Hugo, believed that European countries were originally one family, with the same culture and similar customs. Therefore, they loudly opposed the division of countries. In wartime, the victor also suffers losses. Unfortunately, this federal movement was promoted for only a short time before being extinguished by Prussia's arrogant threats and the outbreak of World War I.</p>
<p>But in 1922, France's Briand shouted the slogan "Unite to live, unite to prosper." Support for this idea grew, and in 1926, the Pan-European Conference was held in Vienna. All European countries participated, with 2,000 representatives in attendance.</p>
<p>At that time, the conference compared the European countries to a state of anarchy. It advocated creating a federation to unify the currency and tariffs, publicly use waterways, and align military and foreign policies; guaranteeing the equality, independence, and security of each federation member. Respecting everyone's religious and ethical beliefs. All disputes should be resolved peacefully by the federal court. Cooperating with other countries as much as possible in accordance with international order.</p>
<p>The people promoting this movement were not just idealists living in an ivory tower. They were all reputable and successful figures. Churchill strongly supported this federation at the time.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no shortage of people who opposed the federation: arms manufacturers, nationalistic politicians, and international financiers who exploited tariff policies. But they never attacked the system itself; they praised the idea, but they said it was a utopianism, an unattainable ideal. According to them, how could such a large area with so many different ethnic groups and different languages succeed in forming a federation?</p>
<p>But advocates of the federation cited more counter-evidence. They said: Italy and Germany had previously been divided into many counties, but after arduous struggles, the entire country was finally unified. The elements of the United States are even more complex, but after successfully forming a federation, it became such a progressive country. Speaking of the size of the area, Europe is only two-thirds the size of the United States and not even half the size of the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Switzerland is a good miniature of the European federation: among the twenty-two administrative regions, there are different religions, different languages, different ethnic groups, and different political systems, but look at what happened after they formed a federation.</p>
<p>At that time, there were twenty-six governments protecting the Pan-European Federation. It seemed that this system could be successful, but unfortunately, Briand died in 1932, followed by Hitler's aggressive actions, which triggered a world war. This federation had long been forgotten until Churchill re-emphasized the necessity of European unity on March 22, 1943, when everyone became concerned about this system again. Although there is no Briand to promote it now, more and more knowledgeable people in various countries are supporting this doctrine.</p>
<p>According to the plan of the current group of promoters, Britain and the Soviet Union will not be included in the federation. Britain has its own federation. If the Soviet Union were to join, the scope of the federation would expand to the Pacific coast, and the Soviet Union is too large, and its joining would unbalance the organization of the federation. But at the same time, Britain and the Soviet Union should break down past prejudices and not use puppet governments or establish spheres of influence in Europe. Because to make the federation system successful, the will of each country in the federation must be free, and the governments of each country must be able to express the public opinion of that country. The European federation needs the friendly cooperation of Britain and the Soviet Union, but in addition to neighborly friendship, it should not have any other extravagant expectations.</p>
<p>What benefits does the European federation have for other countries? There are some. The military equipment of the federation is limited to self-defense, with no imperialist ambitions and will not launch aggressive wars. Therefore, after the success of the European federation, the Soviet Union can no longer worry about the "Western bloc" and can devote all its efforts to developing its rich domestic resources. Britain no longer needs to guard against Europe being controlled by Germany or the Soviet Union and can focus on sorting out its complex domestic affairs. The benefits of the federation to the United States are not obvious, but we can know that the United States will no longer be involved in the vortex of war, and the financial and material resources used for Europe can also be used in practice for construction, rather than being wasted.</p>
<p>President Truman's proposal to internationalize European waterways may be the first step in his efforts to organize a European federation.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Mei Youyun</p>
<p>After several days of rain, the mountain city is muddy everywhere. The children who were looking forward to wearing new clothes and hats for the "New Year" had to spend it at home.</p>
<p>The "Folk Art Museum" run by the famous comic dialogue and drum singer Shanyao Dan is preparing to be completed before the Spring Festival. It is built in "Geling" in Central Park, and the first performance after completion is scheduled to be the multi-act drama "" by the Triumph Flying Car Dance Troupe.</p>
<p>Liu Fengzhao, who presented a horse in "July 7th" of the previous year, also brought his Chinese National Art Circus to catch the Spring Festival excitement. This 60-year-old gentleman said when he led his well-trained steed onto the donation platform in "July 7th" of the previous year: "If you have money and don't donate, you're not as good as Liu Fengzhao, who performs in the circus. If you have strength and don't contribute, you're like Liu Fengzhao's horse." The newspaper headline for him was "Presenting the horse with tears streaming down, hating people who are not as good as horses"? That donation increased the effectiveness of the gold donation considerably. This 60-year-old gentleman looks no more than 40 or 50 years old. His father is already 82 years old this year and can still wield a broadsword!</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Magazines" that the people in Chongqing are eagerly awaiting, except for a few small-paper-type publications that are sold in the market, not a single other excellent magazine can be bought. It is said that it is not that the Shanghai cultural world has forgotten the people of Chongqing, but that it is restricted by the regulations of the post office.</p>

<h3>The Doomsday of School Shops Has Arrived!</h3>
<p>— Luo Yu</p>
<p>In the past, when the enemy and puppets were entrenched, not only did the number of primary and secondary schools in the city not decrease sharply, but school shops sprang up like mushrooms after rain. Therefore, you can often see advertisements for schools calling for transfer and takeover in newspapers. Unlicensed schools filled the city. These speculative merchants in the education industry, carrying the beautiful banner of private schooling, rented a little bit of housing. The pavilion can be used as an office, and the living room can be separated by three plywood into two classrooms. The patio, drying platform, and kitchen can be built to make up the numbers. Advertisements are posted in newspapers to attract customers. Some even use their brains to exhaust all means to "poach" students from other schools. Unfortunately, there are too few students who can afford to study. There are as few as dozens of students, but they can save expenses as much as possible and reduce class time. Teachers are paid by the hour, and salaries are as meager as possible. Good teachers are not hired. If teachers are absent from class, their salaries are deducted. School starts late and ends early. The school shop owners collect all the tuition fees at once and hoard the goods. When the goods rise in price, they are even more reluctant to sell them. The teachers' salaries can be dragged on. The teachers are committed to public service and dare not speak to the boss, fearing that their rice bowl will not be secure next semester. Which of the school shop owners is not pot-bellied, traveling in chartered cars, and can also do side jobs, such as selling diplomas and transfer certificates? The diploma of a certain middle school is sold for two dou of rice each, as long as you entrust someone who has studied in his school, and he shamelessly covers up and says: "Our school is enthusiastic about education and helps you to be able to go to school, just doing our best."</p>
<p>With victory, the school shop owners' sweet dreams are over, right? They have misled the children of so many families and destroyed so much of the country's vitality, causing the young people of Shanghai today to have the mentality of "If the young master has money, which school is not good to study in"?</p>
<p>Although my country's education is backward, we should encourage schooling more. Of course, we admire those altruistic and enthusiastic donors who run schools. However, in Shanghai, these school shops that hang a sheep's head but sell dog meat are actually harmful and useless to education. They should be severely banned and widely merged!</p>
<p>The reason why there are so many unemployed youths in Shanghai now is not that there are no schools, but economic reasons. On the contrary, after the school shops are abolished, the standard formal schools can increase their enrollment, and the economy can naturally be improved. With the elimination of redundant expenses, the problems of heavy studies, teacher treatment, and free education for unemployed youths can all be easily solved.</p>
<p>With the opening of the school season approaching, the school shop owners are changing their names and identities, and shamelessly posing as hard-working educationists. They are putting Li hats on Zhang's head and brazenly making me unable to come out and say these words.</p>

<p>How to Correct the Lack of Order Among Soldiers Taking Vehicles</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I take the tram at the end of North Sichuan Road every day. Passengers line up to wait for the bus, and the order is good. However, armed soldiers often do not follow the order and climb freely, preventing the people who are waiting in line from taking the bus. The police cannot interfere either, and everyone can only swallow their anger and see them off with angry eyes. If this continues, it will not be a good solution. Please ask how to correct this? (Mo Long)</p>
<p>(Answer) This situation is indeed visible everywhere. There is no denying that the quality of soldiers is low, and they lack training. It is hoped that the commanders of various troops will provide guidance during memorial weeks or collective talks. The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association should be responsible for correcting this. If everyone can maintain order and give people a good impression, they will naturally be respected by everyone, which would be a very good thing. Moreover, this matter is easy to do, so why shouldn't the military and political leaders be happy to do it!</p>
<p>How to Correct My Bad Temper</p>
<p>Editor: When I talk or argue with friends, I never want to suffer a loss, and I always want to fight for justice. I know that my temper is too hot, and I refuse to admit defeat. I cannot be patient, and I always want to meddle in other people's affairs. I have almost broken off with all my friends, and I feel very ashamed. Please, sir, instruct me on how to change my ways. (Lin Hui)</p>
<p>(Answer) The worst thing is when a person does not admit their own mistakes. Then, with stubborn prejudices, it will always be difficult to change their ways and start anew. It is really great that you can honestly examine your own mistakes. It is best to "think" more before getting angry and to endure your anger. You will naturally be calm and collected. Usually, you can read more of the teachings of ancient sages, such as books on the cultivation of famous people. You will definitely be able to change your temperament and measure.</p>

<p>Sir: In the "Reader Opinions" column of your newspaper on the 12th, there are several questions from Yang Bujun regarding the promotion of the charity badge. Now, we reply as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Charity Badge was printed by the China Cultural Investment Company with 50,055 honorary badges and 94,003 ordinary badges (receipts are available). It was originally intended to have the company print the numbers, but due to insufficient equipment and the impossibility of the time, the students arranged them themselves, and more than 60 students worked for two days and two nights to complete 90% of them. The remaining 10% only had numbers compiled on the first sheet of each strip, and the students of each school were notified to compile them in order. It is feared that the students were negligent, so charity badges without compiled numbers were found.</p>
<p>(2) In order to avoid misunderstandings, the Association had publicized in advance that the price of the charity badges was divided into two types, 1,000 yuan and 200 yuan, so the amount received by the Association completely matches the number of charity badges issued.</p>
<p>(3) All accounts will be published in the newspapers as soon as the settlement is completed. Shanghai Heavy Burden Charity Federation</p>
