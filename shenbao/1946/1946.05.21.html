<h3>白崇禧赴四平街視察　北上國軍迫公主嶺　劉翰東返遼北省會主政</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕四平街大決戰之結果，業已揭曉，國軍十九日晨完全佔領新四平街。並分五路繼續前進，下一決戰地當爲長春南惟一邱陵地之公主嶺，如國軍乘勝進駐該地，則長春可不戰而下。一般推測，畏春爭奪戰，可造成更大之仇恨，激起更複雜之局勢，但另方面亦可能成爲新談判之易於成功的基礎。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電」瀋陽。長春間局勢之新轉變，此間日來已有普遍之感覺，自白崇禧將軍抵瀋後，關係方面昨已接獲前綫電訊，謂四平街以北共軍，由空中偵察所見，確已開始總　潰，此因由兩翼推進之國軍，已將共軍之增援補給綫以迅雷不及掩耳之快速進軍，予以截斷，惟官方爲慎重起見，不願將此類消息透露過早。據熟悉長春情形者談，長春共軍實力甚薄，四平街完全收復後，通往長春之大道，僅餘公主嶺一大險要，國共兩軍決戰之序幕，即將在該地展開。相持三十二天之四平街爭奪戰，顯非主力戰，國軍兩翼之推進，已注定四平街共軍正面必敗之命運，前此國軍單綫直入，不無輕敵之嫌，今則國軍對於共軍實力旣有正確估計，加之白崇禧上將親臨審陽視察，孫立人將軍之重領新一軍，業使前錢士氣爲之一振，以此對照，今後共軍縱能傾其全部賭注，在公主嶺一綫作頭强抵抗，亦不易挽回其頽勢矣。</p>
<p>〔央新瀋陽廿日電〕白副總長崇禧，廿日午偕杜長官聿明，梁副長官華盛，乘專車離瀋赴四平街防地，視察國軍接防情形。</p>
<p>〔又電〕四平街為遼北省會，三月十七日爲共軍攻陷，省主席劉翰東及各省委均被俘，劉主席嗣脫險逃出，在瀋成立辦事處，今四平街完全收復，共軍潰散，劉主席今午離瀋前往主持省政</p>
<p>〔中央社四平街廿日電〕北上國軍，廿日下午五路迫近公主嶺。</p>
<p>〔又電〕四平收復後，已失去原來面目，常地人口原爲十七萬，共軍攻佔後，人民紛紛逃亡，現僅餘四萬人，房屋更毀壞不堪，多數房屋均被拆做燃料，存糧被搜括一空，現遭遇空前糧荒，機塲幸尙完好，可以使用，國軍進駐城市後，市民陸續歸來，惟已無屋可居，懊慘之狀，使人心酸。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿日電〕此間一般相信，國軍佔領四平街後，一星期內當可抵達長春，惟聞共軍已調兵十三萬，阻止國軍推進。</p>
<h3>北寗路國軍會師　被佔各站已收復</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕國軍收復北寗路之前所，高嶺幷小松嶺溝後，自綏中南下與自楡關北上之部隊，已在昨下午六時於小松嶺溝會師。近日共軍攻佔之各站，迄此完全收回。惜鐵路被破壞慘重，一時不易通車。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕遼陽宮原綫（中長路支綫）已修至安平，該段長卅一公里，全綫六十九公里，預定今明全部修復。</p>
<h3>編餘軍官失業　在漢撂倒求乞</h3>
<p>〔本報漢廿日日電〕武漢行營自月初停止登記，編餘軍官後，大批失業軍官，多流落漢市，生活潦倒不堪，速日並有少校軍官黃某，以歷任五十三軍等連排長委狀，舖置中山道旁，向行人求乞，見者深爲惋惜，咸盼當局妥籌解救辦法。</p>
<h3>軍調部辯論熱河問題　傳國軍收復北票　執行小組將視察津外圍</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕熟河問題成爲今日執行部交通會議席上辯論之焦點，但無任何結果，政府方面張六師詢問熱河共軍爲何進襲北票，破壞錦州朝陽綫鐵路交通，並請即予制止。共方代表則聲稱政府軍利用該綫，調動軍隊，故共軍加以破壞，在東北戰事未停止前，共軍破壞行動，亦不能停止。雙方激辯良久，最後美方代表希爾稱，根據協定，關於華北華中恢復交通命令，尙未包括熟河在內，此事容再礎商。又軍調部中共計劃執行處副處長李聚奎，奉葉劍英命，昨飛承德視察。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕軍調部已決派遣執行小組靦察平津外圍，顯以消弭範圍日漸擴大之軍事衝突，小組人員正由三方分別遴派中，一俟準備完竣，即可出發，平津外圍軍事衝突重要地區有二處，一爲永定河畔之安次，一爲畏城綫上之昌平。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕傳北票已被國軍重新奪回，熱河國軍所處之地位，已見改善，惟此訊尙待證實。北票位於瀋陽錦州與承德之連絡點上，有豐富之煤產，爲一戰略要地。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕此間官方接獲報吿，平綏東段及古北口一帶，因共軍增兵，頓吿吃緊，大戰一觸即發，他方傳賀龍部遊擊隊諜報人員二百餘，到達昌平，企圖潛入北平。</p>
<h3>萬縣青年軍團長　途中被學生槍殺</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿日電〕現住萬縣之靑年軍二〇四師六一一團少將團長黃公繼，於返防途中，被該師學生刁京元槍殺身死，事後兇手亦自殺斃命。</p>
<h3>增加縣政效率　鄂省轉令遵辦</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿日電〕內政部以縣政工作繁重，頃電各省政府轉飭各縣，减少各種集會，以免影響行政效率，鄂省當局已轉令遵辦。</p>
<h3>童正苓姜伯華　在京當庭對質</h3>
<p>江泰輪案偵訊終結</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十日電〕軍政部軍法司今晨九時傳訊童芷苓與被扣押之後勤總部天津辦事處長姜伯華對質，同時江泰輪船長陳邦基亦被傳到庭。童否認與姜認識，更不認江泰輪遲開十時，與渠有若何關係。船長亦稱江泰輪遲開係候潮汛，並無奉命等候之事。今爲偵査庭，禁止旁聽，聞偵訊終結後，擬公開審理，童伶定今夜車偕伊母及伴其來京之皇后兩職員同返上海，仍隨傳隨到。</p>
<h3>馬帥關切華北局勢　聲明盡力防東北戰事蔓延　政協綜合小組會在準備中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕大局已在津浦，平綏兩路，濟南，蘇北，鄂北各地傳來之警報更覺沉重，但綜合小組會議之準備工作，仍在各方不斷努力中。聞今晨九時邵力子曾與靑年黨代表常乃悳作一小時之會談，新任交通部長兪大維，亦於今午續與馬歇爾特使作第八次之會談，談話時間長逾二不時半，聞馬使對於中國當前嚴重之局勢，雖已感覺極端苦悶，但仍以極難得之耐心，詢問中國目前各地之交通現狀，並蒐集各方較爲可信之情報，以作參考。據常至寗海路五號之某外籍人士談：馬使不信國共兩軍無視二萬萬以上人民之痛苦，即刻決戰。並信馬使爲拯救人類浩刧，致力和平之工作，絕不致受任何一方之武力威脅。馬使已深知，中國混亂之局勢，已不容再事拖延，在今後之一週內，將有重要表示。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕此間馬歇爾總部，今發表聲明，全文如下：「馬歇爾將軍，每日就恢復東北和平事，與中國各政黨代表及其他方面舉行商談，渠對於華北之嚴重局勢深爲關切，現正盡力設法，使東北戰事不致延及華北。目前雙方所進行之宣傳運動，自必激動情緒，並有愈使若干念燥者釀成烽火燎原之可能，此項仇恨與猜忌之輕率宣傳，使目前之嚴重局勢益形加劇，並能導使中國人民遭受不幸之後果。執行小組之工作，因雙方在官兵間加强宣傳，而至感囨難，中國縱非完全制止衝突，而至少使其衝突局部化之努力，則多半有賴於此等執行小組之成功。各小組中之美方代表，正以堅定而公正之努力，應付不僅包括艱難而且甘冒生命危險之局勢，以謀改善現狀。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕北平軍調部以過去邊打邊談，打僵再談，談僵再打之局勢，已使數百執行小組工作人員，疲於奔命，勞而無功，不勝憤慨，已有詳細報告到京，陳述苦況，並提供加強調處權力，改善調解方式之意見。鄭介民，饒伯森來京時，亦曾先後向有關當局報告其寶貴之經騐，並樓陳梗槪，聞今日馬歇爾與兪大維談話時，亦曾檢討及此。據今晚各方透露之消息觀察，如局勢幸而好轉，馬歇爾，兪大維，周恩來有立刻北飛之可能，大局確未至絕望之境。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕政府政協代表王世杰，邵力子與政協秘書長雷震，廿日午十時往訪青年黨政協代表常乃悳及該黨中常委劉東巖，下午一時常乃悳，劉東巖及靑年黨代表團秘書長劉泗英，至梅園新村訪董必武，旋常，劉二氏復應張羣之的，赴張氏寓邸晤談，聞渠等在往來談晤中，曾對當前時局問題廣泛交換意見。</p>
<h3>新舊市長昨晨交接　吳市長接篆視事　發表施政方針將從大處着眼　祝平谷春帆定今午就職</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市新任市長吳國楨氏，昨日十午出席市府紀念週後，正式接印視專開始辦公。先是錢前市長於八時半派總務處長施邦瑞代表前往百老匯大厦迎迓，吳氏於九時正偕新任秘書長何德奎，地政局長祝平同車蒞臨，在軍樂聲中由警察局長宣鐵吾導引至二樓，再由沈前秘書長迎入市長辦公室，經錢市長一一介紹各局長及市府各處處長與吳市長相見後，即相偕出席紀念週，九時四十五分接印，並即佈吿視事。新任財政局長谷春帆於昨晨十時由京抵滬，即赴市府晋謁吳市長，谷定今日下午三時同時與新任地政局長祝平就職視事。</p>
<h3>錢前市長致詞　歡迎新市長　告別舊同仁</h3>
<p>九時零五分，吳新市長由錢前市長陪同至禮堂，首次出席紀念週，行禮如儀後，首由錢市長致吿別詞，略謂。「今日新任市長吳國楨先生首次出席紀念週，同時先行接事，本人以前任市長之地位，向吳市長道賀並向各位吿辭，去年八月抗戰勝利，本人奉主席命，就任上海市長，自知能力薄弱，過去上海因租界關係，在外人統制下不受我國法令枸束，抗戰軍興，上海淪陷允早，受敵僞之痛苦尤深，迨勝利到來，全市市民在羣情歡忭之餘，熱望減除痛苦，謀取福利，本人奉命之後，亦即懷此願望，雖經兢兢業業與各位同仁共致最大努力，但以德薄能鮮，未能達到目的，故向中樞當局迭次請辭，今幸邀核准，本人自覺八月來毫無建樹，謹向各同人及全市市民致萬分歉意，吳市長爲本人十餘年老友，歷任漢口重慶市長，外交部次長，中宣部長，以吳市長之才力，定能勝任愉快，本人不僅爲吳市長賀，亦爲市民深慶得人。本人在滬八月，得諸位同人協助，尙無隕越，今日吿別，特向各位致謝。</p>
<h3>吳市長　致詞表示　三點感想二種信念　願努力工作決不要錢</h3>
<p>吳市長致詞：本人今日在視事之際，應首先向錢市長表示感謝，因錢市長於抗戰勝利後，來滬主持市政，過去八個月係最艱苦之階段，今後上海一切情形，應能進人正常化。關於施政方針，現未便談，亦談不到，本人願略述感想數端：第一，上海係通商要地，國際觀瞻所繫，且係全國經濟中心，其一切狀態，均足以影響及全國。市政機構提高行政效率，實屬必要。憶昔年在漢口市長任期內，曾來滬考察工部局各項設施，其辦理方針固係另一問題，而其工作效能實有足取者。現滬市租界業已收回，治權完全統一，上海在國人治理下，一時雖不能超過工部局時代之治績，但至少須能與昔時同，此係吾人應有之標的，亦可爲係一種希望。</p>
<p>第二，欲使行政效率提高，須光謀安定公務員生活，如何使公務員工作合理化，則應因事擇人，而不應有人無事可做，同時工作勞逸亦應平均。至於公務員之待遇，本人以爲至少應維持其最低生活之水準，然後始能使其安心工作，本人以爲公務員，不應想享受與安逸，尤其在上海，奢靡成風，公務員尤貴能首先倡導，餐成廉潔風氣，爲市民模範。　第三，本人奉命來滬，深覺膽怯，係從來所未有，良以上海環境複雜，一切毫無把握。惟有兩種信心，敢爲同人吿：一，次人決不要一個錢，二，決頭努力工作，捨此而外，無可述者。本府同人茍有高見，不論職位大小，本人極願聆取意見，深望知無不言，言無不盡，　時貢獻。</p>
<p>關於施政，主張應從大處着眼，凡屬於國計民生有裨益之事，經詳密研究決定後，認為可行，即以快刀斷亂麻之手段，努力做法，藉期安定社會秩序，　　經濟基礎，發展新上海建設，願與各位同人一致勞力。</p>

<h3>內部人事　略有更動</h3>
<p>布府內部人事，因總務處，人事處，接收物資管理處等各主管人員，均堅吳市長於昨日照准，經發表歐　遵銓爲總務處處長，鄭火牧爲人事處處長，馮世範爲機要室主任，黃開文為機要室組長兼監印，吳使人爲事務科長，胡夢北爲出納科長，張彼　為交際科長，黃金　為接收物資管理處處長，王冠育爲參事（在黃處長未到任前兼代接收物資管理處長），張　才，曾剛甫，嚴徴任爲　　接收總務事宜。</p>
<h3>東北共軍數千運烟台　濟外圍戰事激烈　執行小組代表正謀制止</h3>

<p>〔本報濟南廿日電〕　濟沿綫之戰事無重大變化，惟明水全鎭已於昨日被共軍完全佔領，郭店一帶戰事仍在激列進行中，聞該地共軍配備優良，並附有　擊砲多門。據軍方消息，共軍刻正發動四萬餘衆三面進迫濟垣，頗有奪取濟南械企圖。</p>

<h3>採購洋米疏通有無　糧荒難關即可渡過　徐堪在中樞紀念週上報告</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕中樞紀念週廿日晨九時舉行，蔣主席領導行禮後，由糧食部部長徐堪報告糧政，徐氏首述目下糧食問題，甚爲艱困，然此爲戰後必然之現象，蓋在抗戰期間，我國作戰最久，淪陷區最大，且因上年湘粵豫等省，皆遭荒歉，台灣東北，又無餘糧供應，同時若干地區，復受封鎖及交通影響，遂使去年所定購食糧七百四十萬石之計劃，至今僅辦到三分之一，未能達成充分準備各軍民糧食之目的。徐氏　提出解決當前糧食問題辦法稱：（一）遵照二中全會決議，決繼續恢復田賦徴實辦法，政院業已決定自七月一日起施行。（二）以徴存之餘糧，運濟缺糧地區，擬將四川歷年餘糧之二百萬石，接濟長江下游各省，江西存糧項下，以五十萬石，運濟京滬各地，安徽購糧共一百八十萬石，亦將酌撥運濟缺糧地區，此外最近洽購洋米兩批，約一萬七千噸，及聯總運濟之糧食，均可陸續運來，糧荒情形，將可减除。總之，我國目前糧荒問題，雖極嚴重，但時間將不至甚長，即可渡過難關。徐氏言及邇來上海糧價暴漲時謂，顯係有不良份子操縱搗亂，關於南京公敎人員之食糧，徐氏並謂，決負責不使缺乏，詞畢，紀念週於九時五十分禮成。</p>
<h3>彭部長舉行茶會　首次招待新聞界</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕中宣部長彭學沛，廿日下午三時假國際聯歡社首次茶會招待新聞界，到中外記者約一百人，彭氏發表簡略致詞，並譯爲英文，歷時四十分鐘，茲誌彭部長致詞原文如次：在過去十五年中，兄弟的工作主要是在經濟方，面大部份時間是在交通部和戰時生產局服務，因此和新聞界未能取得密切聯絡，兄弟恐怕決難步吳部長的後塵，有他那樣良好的成績，只希望兄弟的缺點，能够因各位的協助，而得到彌補，希望各位繼續給兄弟協助，如同協助前任宣傳部長一樣。</p>
<p>中國現正進入憲政時期，一黨執政的階段已成過去，政府已經擴大了基礎，邀請了黨外份子參加政府裏最重要的職務，在各省和各重要城市都已經成立了民意機關，各位親目所覩的是重慶和上海的市參議會，選舉是完全自由的，各種政治意見的代表都被選了出來，這些一切都是表明政府是不等待憲法的正式製定，便已實施了許多重要的步驟，以實現眞正的民主政府，這個過程正在繼續進展，政府正在盼望共黨方面能停止他們的軍事攻勢，實行他們的諾言，協助完成中國的統一。</p>
<p>各位一定想問問兄弟對於時局的見解，兄弟很願意坦白說明，雖然在今天這種聚會並不預備發表冗長的演說，據兄弟的觀察，目前最重要，最急迫的問題，是各重要交通路綫的恢復，不要說我說這話是三句話不離本行，這個實在是我過去三個月間，在上海深切研究中國經濟情形的結果</p>
<p>我在上海差不多每天視察工廠那裏的工人們衆口一詞，地老是問我隴海路，津浦路，平漢路何時通車，他們說他們缺乏煤炭，棉花和各種重要原料，受着工廠停工和失業的威脅，那些原料或則無法運到，或則運費貴得稀奇，一切工人和工業家都認這事是他們的生死存亡的決定因素，工廠能否繼續工作，勞工能否繼續就業，生產成本能否減低，大部份取決於各運輸路綫的恢復。他方面農民吃虧更大，有些地方農產只無法運出，許多其他地方農民餓死的到千萬百萬之多。</p>
<p>所以兄弟的愚見，要減輕目前經濟的艱窘，要防止未來可能的危機，每一個對於老百姓有同情的人，都應該盡心竭力來解決這個問題。</p>
<p>兄弟今天極愉快，能和各位把晤一堂，希望今後常得聚首，敬祝各位的成功。</p>

<h3>長春廿九天（三）</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　邵愼之</p>
<p>（本文前兩節刊十八十九兩日本報第一第七版，請參閱。）</p>
<p>歌聲與苦</p>
<p>滿　大樓，在我們住的期間，原是清冷得連鬼都找不出來。十五日清晨，工役急急叩門說：「共軍已打到國務院了。」一夜槍聲，自遠至近，我們本來就不敢安枕，可是連日勞頓，黎明時終於睡得濃濃，一聲也聽不見。我急忙把衣服穿起，整理衣箱，從此我們知道，我們的生命，將隨這戰爭的開始一天天的緊張起來，生命將不再是我們自己的了。</p>
<p>竹舟（中央社長春分社主任）把汽車準備好，要我們去中央銀行，我們明知道中央銀行建築堅固，發電便利，但是一時轉念，中央銀行可能是戰爭中最後爭奪的一個據點，砲火必定集中攻擊。大家商量，還是去外交部特派員公署，幾個美國同業住在那兒，或者比較人多，可以多出些主意；同時也可以避免砲火的集中。一時思潮起伏，先後矛盾，眞不知何所適從。竹舟和我終於先去中央銀行，這時槍砲聲是愈打愈密了！</p>
<p>中央銀行距離特派員公署，不過七百公尺，在洋台上可以看見中央銀行大樓的國旗。遙遙相對，可是街上滿佈鐵絲網，已不是行人單獨可以通過的。中央銀行附近的大同廣塲，除有二三輛增援的軍車馳出外，其他什麼都看不見。和中美記者同住在特派員公署趙君邁市長，似乎有先鑒之明，要竹舟和我回來。下午三時，我在回來之前打個電話吿訴大家，西飛機塲已失去，火車站附近已在猛烈爭奪中。四點鐘，還用電話向空軍司令部聯絡，滿想找金司令說話，誰知金司令已經偷偷地乘飛機逃回瀋陽了。於是美國記者五人　　門報的　　　，　即駛車空軍司令部，那時代理金司令的曹陰長，正手持話筒，向機塲問情況，大家知道情形不好，問了半天，沒有人來答話。事後我們知道五點鐘的時候，留守機塲的保安隊，星散逃退。六時許，機塲爲共軍完全佔領。</p>
<p>趙君邁旁晚由市府回來，我們知道情勢緊張到極點，通至西機塲興安大道上的興安橋，原先由警察總隊駐守，現在已向市區內移，建立新陣地。趙君邁始終是樂觀主義派，他還是用他衡陽市長任上的作戰經騐，認爲可以堅守一個時期。</p>
<p>幾個美國朋友，除合衆社的　子貝克特外，其餘的人都是樂慣了的，不見棺材不會哭的活寶，依舊在樓上大唱其歌，聲震屋宇，疑心連中央銀行都聽得到。世洵和貝克特打開長春市的地圖，在研究戰略上的據點。我特地跑到中行地下室去睡覺，我們深知興安橋失守，加以警察總隊力量的單薄，保衛長春的抵抗力愈打愈小，核心陣地的堅守，是萬難的事情。</p>
<p>夜暮下降，清冷的北風，吹得發出一種悽慘的嘯呌，密集的槍聲，混着不斷的砲聲，由南至北，自東及西，無疑的，共軍是向長春四圍進攻。</p>
<p>我們睡不着，有時難過，有時自己苦笑，中　人　中國人打得這樣　　，　　緊張，弄得我們要發神經病了。</p>
<p>人民不要戰爭</p>
<p>十六日的早晨，市內電話，一度中斷。趙君邁打電話向總機詢問，知道電力快用完了，頂多能够維持到明天下午四時。趙君邁答應總機送汽油去，自動發電。</p>
<p>關於發電的情形，我們在滿　住的時候，譯電方面，全由經委會專員錢瑤章協助我們，所以感到非常方便，自電台移入中行後，從十六起，除軍報外，任何電報，拒收不發。我們來長春，原想以生命換取報導的代價，聽到了這個消息，簡直是當頭一悶棍，頭腦子眞像鉛一般的沉重。</p>
<p>我們中美記者於午前看到城防司令陳家珍時，他答應我們可以在軍用電台發電。於是我們中國記者決定也發英文聯合電訊，軍中繁忙，我們時時躭心，電訊會中斷。</p>
<p>兩天多的戰爭，老百姓死了不少，四處均有濃黑火熖，高可數丈。共軍七五口徑大砲的轟擊，火力足够强了。合衆社的貝克特，他參加過西班牙馬德里的內戰，他說：「馬德里打得沒有這麼兇，中國共產黨打得眞好，那裏是土匪。」我曾經統計過，槍聲最密時，是每分鐘一百八十砲。</p>
<p>張大同曾一度溜回錦州，結果被上級駡回長春。他滿腹不高興，其實我們做了他，也會不滿。張嘉璈在十四日以前由重慶發個電報給張大同，電文上說：「東北問題，政府已有具體辦法，長春方面，最多亦不過像哈爾濱。」當時我們猜不透，不知是指哈爾濱那一方面的現象而言。張嘉璈這種電文，至今想着，只有苦笑。在危急時，張嘉璈又給張大同一個電報：「要大同和趙君邁劉哲三人，向共軍交涉停止戰爭。」話是趙君邁親自講給我們聽的。他說：「熊主任要陳司令堅守長春，張主任又要我們出來講和。」這在我們記者看來，簡直是很難報導的消息。</p>
<p>趙君邁眼看死去的老百姓，頗願意出來調停。他要我們記者也來說一句話。我們首先即拒絕了他的意思，因爲中國記者的筆，已經止不住戰火，嘴還有多少效力？美國人以記者的地位，更不能來管這一難解決的問題。這時八個人民團體的代表，正在奔走設法停戰，他們找到了趙市長，商量一下，他們說：他們和劉哲談話的時候，劉老先生哭了，大家也遂由這八個團體代表寫給共軍方面一封下列的信：</p>
<p>「敬啓者，長春已陷入砲火之中，雙方傷亡均重，人民生命財產之損失，難以估計。爲求人民不再無辜犧牲，請派代表來中外記者團一談，生命安全由長春市長趙君邁，及中長理事會劉哲保證。此致　貴司令」（未完）</p>

<h3>中國與美友好　對蘇亦復如此　孫科談改善中蘇關係</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿日電〕立法院長孫科今日在寓所單獨接見聯合社記者，談稱：「中美兩國必須和平相處，一如善鄰，蘇聯近在東北所抱態度，或許因恐中美兩國加緊連繫，有以致之。目今中蘇兩國似有誤會與猜疑，或許蘇聯以爲中國信賴美國過甚，萬一英美對蘇衝突，中國將入美方陣綫，實則中國不但欲與美國友好相處，即對蘇聯，亦復如此，故對蘇關係，吾人務須有以改善之。爲改善對各國關係起見，中國不僅須臻强盛，更須有獨立的外交政策，庶不致專事信賴任何一方，如果依賴一方，均於世界不利。中國一切重大問題，如通過憲法及組織聯合政府等，均須俟東北糾紛停止，始可解決，如果東北糾紛和平解決，則其他一切問題，均可迎刃而解。而東北大局，現已在軍事三人小組黨中，設法解決。最近行政院人事更迭，羅致無黨派人士兩人，並非政府不顧政協會議決議，此次更迭，乃暫時性質，待最後聯合各黨派組織政府時，將有更重要之變動。當前問題，厥爲如何設法協調，一方面爲極端保守派，另一方面係極端激進派，必須求其均衡。一俟國共雙方互相信任，國父遺敎　即不難實現。</p>

<p>滬杭綫實地考察　工商業成本高銷路清淡</p>
<p>〔本報杭州廿日電〕本報記者於本月十五日出發赴滬杭沿綫各地考察，於廿日返杭，爲時五日，滬杭間本屬文物富庶之區，米絲產地，戰時受敵僞剝削，人民困苦，勝利後，工業界均因成本過高，銷路淸淡，而外貨則價廉物美，故多存得過且過之心，商業界因開銷日大，生意冷落，原望蠶開門時，農人售繭獲利，生意或有起色，無如本年養蠶成本特高，而絲廠又不以政府規定之每担十萬元收繭，甚至低至六萬元，土繭低至四萬元，尙無人顧問，而桑葉反高至二萬元一担，所獲償本尙不足，焉有餘資購取貨物。加之今春雨水過多，麥糧未見豐收，故農民心灰意淡，各縣盜匪搶劫時有所聞，水路，公路均不寗靜，鄕鎭洗劫已成慣事，因之謠言四起，風聲鶴唳，人民惶悚不安，各縣參議員選舉，大致均已竣事，惟民衆漠不關心，少數人士控告舞弊至今未休，地方公正人士吿記者謂，長此以往，則江南天堂，恐將變成地獄。</p>

<p>杭州　配煤提高電廠虧蝕</p>
<p>杭州電廠每月所需燃煤，向由經濟部滬區燃管會配給，數量雖有限制，價格則係一律，但自四月份起，配煤價格突然分爲兩種，計供電燈用者以一千五百噸爲限，每噸由三萬八千元連運耗增至五萬四千元，供馬達電用者另撥一千噸，每噸計需十七萬元，除電燈所增有限外，馬達則增至四倍，該廠爲顧及工商用戶負担，曾　請省市當局代向經濟部要求取消此項辦法，迄乏結果，該廠半年來以偸電用戶之不易取締，虧負在二億元以上，以目前成本計算，須月虧五千萬元，故擬酌量增價，藉减虧蝕。</p>

<p>無錫　電省切實抑平米價</p>
<p>本邑縣臨時參議會，新聞記者公會等各公團，因米價一再無理激漲，錫市已逾六萬，顯有商人操縱囤積，事關民食，如不嚴加取締，升斗小民，固將無法生活，物價隨而波動，影響尤極嚴重，十九日特代電蘇省府及田糧管理處，迅飭錫縣府會同憲警嚴查倉庫，切實執行議價，如有違法抬價者，槪予沒收。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>上海人的自覺</h3>
<p>昨天上海市的新市長已就任。我們願乘市府改組之際，一述我們對於上海市地位的看法，以促市民與市政當局的自覺。</p>
<p>從上海內部看上海，有時反看不淸上海的全貌，從全國各角度看上海，才容易看淸上海整個的地位與使命。上海是全國的經濟重心，上海的一切經濟現象，無論是好是壞，其影響都很快的播及於全國。上海人只講消費，全國也只知消費，上海人努力生產，全國也會努力生產。無論黃金米價乃至一切市塲的情形，上海對於全國，有一種不成文的領導作用，內地一切都市的金融界經濟界，都惟上海的馬首是瞻；忝爲馬首的上海，需要有一種責任的自覺。</p>
<p>從上海的內部看上海，爲情感的氛圍所　，所看見的是繁華的夢境，銷金的寶窟，美與醜雜處之居，善與惡交流之所。有陶醉，也有恐慌，有追求，也有詛咒，目迷五色，使人看不淸上海的眞面目。從革命建國的遠大處看上海，我們不揣冒昧敢於提出一種新的認識是：中國最初的革命，是由南革到北，抗戰是由西抗到東，而今後的建國將要由東建到西。所謂由東建到西，並不是重東而輕西，也不是說要東邊建設好了，再去建設西邊；而是說一切建設的資本與技術，要經由東方的樞紐而輸入西方。上海站在中國正東的尖端，吸收海洋的空氣與文明以向全國灌輸，已經有了百餘年的歷史。如果說南京是中國之首，那麼上海便是「中國之肺」。當一二八，八一三上海受到打擊之時，全中國便感到窒息之苦。中國內部蘊藏的資源固極豐富，但如沒有「中國之肺」吸收養氣去加以消化陶鎔，這些豐富的資源將如停留在胃中而不消化的食物，反致釀成遲滯腐朽的病態。抗戰期間，中國由於海岸被敵封鎖，而內部的開發與建設，始終遲滯而莫由暢遂進行，就是明顯的事證。</p>
<p>上海旣是「中國之肺」，所以上海淸明，足以促進中國的健康；上海汚　，足以延長中國的疲敝。我們對此宜有自覺與警惕。</p>
<p>國父嘗謂：「建設之首要在民生」民生建設就是經濟建設。上海旣是經濟的中心，也就是今後國家首要的民生建設的中心。在以往，上海由於不平等條約的關係由於租界的存在，成爲一種外於中國的特殊區域。在那時期，中國貧上海可以獨富，中國亂上海可以獨安。現在這種情形業已改變，今後是中國亂上海不能獨安，中國貧上海不能獨富，上海是中國的上海，上海在中國有重要的地位，也有特殊的責任，上海是中國建設首要的「民生經濟之城」。</p>
<p>一切關於上海的舊觀念需要改變，新認識需要確立，「復員不是復原」這意義在上海特別適用。上海雖是曾經百年以上開發的舊都市，然而生命是新的。這生命是從三十二年一月中美中英平等新約的訂立開始，使這百年的舊都市返老還童。上海現在不過是一個三歲的嬰兒，而這嬰兒的一二兩歲，還是在日寇的鐵蹄下度過，未能認識與享受新生命的實際。新生命的實際，是從抗戰勝利以後，接收之期開始。特別是在國民政府還都以後，上海是密邇首都的大城，夾輔中央發展國家建設的使命，愈加明確。</p>
<p>再不要把上每看做享樂之塲，消遣之所，逋逃的　藪，藏垢納汚的垃圾桶。洗刷舊染之汚，激發新生之氣，當前是一個重要時期。</p>
<p>爲了激揚朝氣，鼓蕩新生，讓我們把所有上海紙醉金迷的現象，紛歧錯亂的畸形，一律撇開；澄心靜氣來一述幾件光明燦爛的史蹟：</p>
<p>第一，値得爲上海稱述的，是中國建國寶典的建國方略，乃完成於上海。當民國六年，國父孫中山先生率海軍南下護法，其後爲桂系軍閥所阻，國父乃率同志離粵赴滬，創辦建設雜誌，以樹立建國理論的基礎，並先後著成孫文學說，實業計畫，民權初步三書，合之而爲建國方略。現値抗戰勝利之後，正是我們實踐建國方略之時。建國方略是國父在軍閥橫行風雨如晦的時期，居住上海時所撰著；在上海撰著的建國方略，仍當以上海爲起點而實踐完成。大上海的計劃，我們應該寤寐求其實現。</p>
<p>第二，值得爲上海稱述的，是上海乃今國府主席蔣先生從事革命實際運動的根據地。民國紀元前一年，蔣先生尙留學日本，是夏請假歸國，即在上海與陳英士先生密議在江浙一帶發動革命，並在上海親自練兵一團，自任團長。民國二年在滬參加討袁二次革命。尤其是民國四年，袁氏稱帝後，陳英士先生就討袁軍總司令職於上海，任蔣先生爲參謀長，十二月五日，運動肇和軍艦獨立，此有名的肇和起義，實爲雲南起義摧毀袁氏帝制而光復民國的先聲。上海僅僅是享樂消遣的塲所嗎？歷史的回答是「不」。在革命建國的過程上，上海有其光輝的標誌，値得回憶與發揚。</p>
<p>現在不僅戰後的經濟建設正待展開，戰後的經濟危機，也急待扭轉，世人皆以上海爲中國經濟重建的起點，也是中國經濟安危的轉捩點。中國經濟經過了長期抗戰，不僅疲弱殘破，而且發生了嚴重的變態，行將走入深長的歧途。如何扭轉機括，轉危爲安，超拔歧途，歸於正軌，自然有待於國家整個經濟政策的指示，而其推行的重要，則不能不託始於上海。况且事實吿訴我們，一種國家經濟政策的釐訂與推行。事前事後，均有待於整個社會的贊助與協力。上海人如無自覺，中國的全盤經濟必受其弊。我們從多角度看上海，覺得上海地位與使命的重大，上海人能自覺，必將爲本身與國家創造光明無限的前途。</p>

<p>〔中央社訊〕英商電車工人罷工問題，已與社會局警察局會商解決，次於今日起恢復交通。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日江海關，清道夫·西服業等工潮，仍呈膠着狀態。惟傳勞資評斷會方面，認為公用事業，不得罷工，政府早有明令在案，故萬不獲已，將予強制執行復工。江海關當局，亦已面諭職工代表，對復工職工，不得採取干涉行動，並將有武力維持秩序。故今日工潮趨勢，或將有所傳變。茲將昨日本報記者趨防工潮各關係方面所得，彙報如後：</p>
<p>電車公司</p>
<p>英商電車公司職工方面，昨晨曾派代表去社會局商談。據彼等之負責人稱：並未開始談判，此去係向當局對此次事件之眞相及原因有所申述，並聲明彼等並非要求增加底薪，而係要求三千四百餘職工應與一百餘寫字間職員同樣增加待遇，何以公司獨對此少數職負之底薪分別起加一元至十元不等。社會局當表示待査明此次事件之責任究應誰負後，再進行調解。又據職工負責人稱：彼等此次行動，係出一致，並無外傳所稱分有派別等說。</p>
<p>江海關</p>

<p>聞海關員工此次怠工已四大，影響航業至鉅，應開之船隻，不能結關，中止出口，進口之船隻，因來貨無法報關提取，以致延誤船期，各公司現已商得稅務司之准許，不結關而出口，惟目的地不能變更，漢陽輪今晨出口駛港，三北公司永嘉輪亦定今晨駛漢，又預備出口之船，亦規定先裝貨然後報關。聞美國總統輪船公司代理之根特爾菲許號，曼赫斯台爾號兩輪，因受海關怠工影響，暫停出口返美。</p>
<p>清道夫</p>
<p>全市淸道夫之罷工，昨日猶在繼續中，街頭垃圾愈積愈多，雜屑廢紙，滿街飛舞，數千肩荷掃帚鐵鏟，衣紅背心之淸通夫，自晨八時起，分由各區趕往社會局請願。彼等手執紅綠紙旗，且以黨國旗作前導，社會局對調解此事頗感棘手，雖經吳局長趙處長及勞動協會陸克明等多方努力，允將現有每月薪津五萬二千元加至六萬元，並每名另借救濟金三萬元，但工人不予接受。至五時牛始陸續散去，並將於今日再作請願調解。</p>

<p>提起吳國楨夫人，黃卓羣女士的芳名，相信凡是在漢口，重慶躭過一些時候或是熟悉外交家軼事的，大槪沒有一個人不知道的。吳夫人給人們最深刻的印象，就是她的「風度」和「才幹」。可是久居在上海不知道勉的人，也許還有很多，因此更期望着一見這上海的第一位夫人。這裏，先可以向大家介紹的：吳夫人是一位理想的外交家或市長夫人，標準的賢妻良母。她沒有一般官太太的架子。而更可爲現代家庭做模範的，就是市長的家庭是一個十二分融洽，美滿的家庭，這對於家庭中每一份子的個性，前途和事業，都有極大的影響。</p>
<p>担心市長身體</p>
<p>「我担心市長的身體，他担任各地職務以來，從未好好休息過，公畢回來，每天都要讀報到深晚」。夫人用着極流利的上海話講起市長長重慶市的時候，每次敵機慘炸重慶，市長都親自冒險出去巡視，有一次不幸眼部受傷，竟至五年後始復原，可是每當辛勞過度後仍會感覺不適。</p>
<p>吳夫人又說：「可是我更担心，市長這次來上海，對於這末一個重要都市，各種情形都很複雜，恐怕不能勝任，將使上海市民失望」。</p>
<p>吳夫人爲人非常和萬熱心，這從市長屬下的談話中完全證明，她對於上上下下的同人，都十分客氣。她不希望多發表個人的事情，但願意記者代她提倡提倡節約，她說：「每個人都喜歡舒服點，固然，在國家安定的時候，環境好一點的人們，可以比別人生活俊裕些，可是目前不知有多少的男女老幼同胞，流離失所，樹皮充肌，無衣蔽體，慘不忍睹。我們想到他們的痛苦，就應該自已節省點」。</p>
<p>關心難童敎育</p>
<p>市長夫人對於難童敎育，特別關心，她辦平民學校有六七年的歷史，在重慶時曾祖任兒童保育會的工作。可惜吳夫人身體很弱，曾遵醫師囑要休息一年，但她不肯放棄社會事業，她感嘆着說：「上海還有那末多的兒童，我們要做的事，正多着呢！」不過她認爲職業對於婦女雖很重要，但家庭婦女的責任也是不應該忽視。她對於重慶婦女在抗戰中爲國家盡力，引爲無上光榮。「我自己一點能力也沒有」，她謙虛地說：「希望大家都能隨時來指教我，批評我，我一定願意接受的，而且希望你們常常來像朋友一採談談」。</p>
<p>吳夫人敎養子女，完全是現代化的，她的兩位女公子吳修蓉，現年十四歲，吳修蕙十三歲，在兩月前到上海入中西女校初中求學，在滬時由她令妹黃卓雄女士照顧。兩位公子吳修廣十一歲，吳修成八歲，現在還在南京，不久就要接來上海。</p>
<p>問起她是不是要搬家，吳夫人說：「這裏房子比起重慶來，不知道要好上幾倍，我覺得實在太奢侈了。可是我好像鄕下人一樣，尤其因爲身體不好，在這末一個熱鬧地方，晚上怎樣也睡不着，所以很想找個靜點的房子」。</p>
<p>吳夫人是福建厦門人，但從小生長在漢口，她是一個語言天才家，無論說湖北話，普通話，上海話，英語，都是口齒淸楚而流利。她是中西女塾的高材生，據她的同學說：吳夫人在校時「非常溫文爾雅，國文根底特別的妤。」吳夫人對於國拌有極濃厚的興趣，喜繪國畫。熟識她的人都知道她沒有一點闊太太們的嗜好。</p>
<p>臨走時，吳夫人給我的印象，使我想起了蔣夫人，聽說蔣夫人對她十分讚揚。的確，在她的舉止談吐之間，我發覺有些地方很像蔣夫人。</p>

<h3>迎新送舊別紀　門外僚屬依依惜別　樓頭佳賓連連道賀</h3>

<p>一輛黑色　車輕快地開到，警察局的　　興奮地　起　來，　市長笑容滿面的走下汽車，警察屬的宣局長早在門口迎迓了，便引導了吳市長登上二樓，那時，錢市長也愉快地新自出來迎接了。</p>
<p>九點零五分，就開始了新舊二位市長同時出席的紀念週。攝影記者忙着拍照，大家充滿了興奮的情緒，傾聽着新市長第一次對上海三百多萬民衆的昭示。</p>
<p>九點三十分，紀念週完畢，錢市長將黃緞包裹的大印親自交給新市長。十分鐘後，錢前市長向新市長告辭，從二樓一直到市府大門，密密排滿了依依惜別的市府職員。吳市長親自送到大門，在悠揚的音樂聲中，錢前市長走上了汽車。</p>
<p>從汽車的窗口，錢前市長的手伸了出來，他向恭送他的許多僚屬招着手，吿別了八個月來辛勤工作的市政府，這是充滿了驚濤駭浪的八個月！上海人是永遠感謝他慘澹經營的努力的　吳市長回到了辦公室，他開始批閱第一件公文，這是他接印視事布告的擬稿，他批上了一個「楨」字，想了一想，寫下了「五·二十」。這大紅的布吿在十點廿五分貼了出來服引了無數的市民。</p>
<p>接着，市長就在會客室接見各局長，十點十分，新任財政局長谷春帆由南京趕到晋謁。那時賀客盈門，市政府收到了九十四張賀客的名片，第一位趕到的是王曉籟。吳市長一一應接，極為忙碌，十點五十分，秘書長何德奎伴同市長，視察市府各辦公室。十一點零五分，本報社長潘公展到市府致賀，新聞發怖組未虛白趕到通報，市長立即停止視察，延見後並自親送出，昨天這許多賀客中，市長親自送出的，祇潘氏一人。潘氏告辭後，市長仍繼續視察各辦公處，並欣然為記者在他的玉照上簽名。　正午，市長到邁爾西愛路十三層樓赴宴，下午三時再回到市府，召開了全滬人士矚目的糧食緊急會議。</p>
<p>吳市長仍舊穿着那天飛滬時穿的那身灰色洋裝，精神愉快，，滿面笑容—可是，他因為公事忙碌，這幾天每夜祇有四小時的睡眠！市長太太已經在關心他的健康了。</p>
<p>吳市長回到辦公室後，市政府的茶房馬上就逢人打聽市長愛喝那一種茶。有人吿訴他「清茶」後，一杯杯的清茶就川流不息的送上來了，主人喝淸茶，客人自然就不妨也清茶。四只大勢水瓶還嫌少，實在客人太多了。</p>

<h3>敎部令京滬平津等七市　從速收回校舍　並呈請政院分令佔用機關早日交還</h3>
<p>〔本報南京專電〕抗戰勝利後，各大都市復員，人口激增，兒童失學者衆，故國民學校勢須盡量恢復原校，擴充學額，俾學童就學有所，不致向隅。惟各地人口增加，學校數反比戰前減少，其中最大原因，除校舍於戰期損毀之外，頗多於勝利接收之時，爲其他機關先入借住者，因此欲立時恢復學校，稍受影響。聞敎部已分令京·滬·平·津·靑島·大迎·哈爾濱等市敎育當局，從速設法復校救濟各該市失學兒童，對於敵僞破壞校舍，如一部份尙可勉强適用者，　盡量利用，倘校舍已作別用者，亦應從迅收回，以便復校。並聞敎部爲協助各地方收回校舍起見，同時並呈行政院，請分令各當地佔用小學校舍之軍政及其他機關，早日交還房屋，備復校應用云。（愚）</p>

<h3>何炳松電敎部　力辭英大校長</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕敎育部令調曁南大學校長何炳松氏為國立英士大學校長，其曁大校長遺缺，改委上海臨大主任李壽雍接充。茲悉何炳松氏以病軀待養，電呈敎育部朱家驊部長，請准辭去英大新職。原電如下：「炳松奉命服務曁大，已逾十年，歲月蹉跎，毫無建樹，徒以時値抗戰，未敢言辭。頃閱報載，蒙鈞部調長英大，想係事實。本當遵辦，唯炳松年來疾病叢生，難勝繁劇，加以英大三院，注重農工，均非素習，人事組織，定感困難，貿然應命，將於公私均無裨益。今曁大校長，旣已繼任得人，贊予炳松以卸肩養病之機會，爲此務懇鈞長准予辭去新職，以免貽誤，不勝感戴之至。因病未能赴京面陳，並乞鑒及。」</p>

<h3>居院長在東吳大學　演講法律與倫理　舉孟子「瞽叟殺人」一章作例證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕司法院院長居覺生氏，上星期週抄，應東吳大學代校長盛振爲博士之邀，於十八日下午五時，在該校同學廳，對法學院學生演講，居氏年逾耳順，精神矍鑠，輕袍布履，談吐豪爽。由盛代校長向學生致詞介紹後，居氏即開始演講，舉孟子「舜爲天子，皐陶爲士，瞽叟殺人」一章，闡明法律與倫理之關係。蓋執法應嚴，所謂執法如山，山有時而可動，但南山可移，此範無動，此實阜陶之責。瞽叟與舜，乃父子之親，法固應守，而論常之情，亦不可乖戾，必人情法理，兩求其正，始可以對天之命，爲民之則。故舜棄天下，視如敝屣，順天應人，方爲不謬。立法本旨，不論個人主義，家族主義，而民族主義，遞嬗遷易。但由有身有家，以至形成占代宗法社會，以迄國家觀念之成熟，數千百年之沿革，總不離乎偷理關係。端賴倫理，然後可以濟法令之窮，使律令之行使，有轉圜餘地，不致叢生窒礙。即我抗戰所以能堅持八載之久，終得最後勝利，亦維持此倫理，此正氣，有以成之也，云云。按居氏為該校校董，其平時愛護學校，訓迪學子，實無微不至。此次演講，倍受該校學生熱烈歡迎。市校私校分別規定日期</p>

<p>〔本報重慶專訊〕抗勝之後，除各校復員遷出川境，回歸原地者外，經敎部核定留川辦理之專科以上學校及國立中等學校，其動態如下：（一）國立女子師範學院，校址在白沙，復員計劃：遷至重慶。（二）國立中央技藝專科學校，校址布樂山，復員遷設三台。（三）國立中央工業專科職業學校，校址在沙坪壩，復員留渝。（四）國立中央技藝專校分校，校址在自流井，復員改名自貫技專。（五）國立十六中學，校址在永川，復員交川省辦理。（六）國立十八中學，校址在三台，復員交川省辦理。（七）國立女子中學，校址在合江，復員交川省辦理。（八）國立重慶師範，校址在北殕，復員交川省辦理，其校畏馬客謨改任江蘇省立江寗師範校長。（九）國立女子師範學校，校址在江北縣洛磧鎭，復員交川省辦理。（十）國立勞作師範，校址在靑木關，復員交川省辦理。（十一）國立江津師範，校址在江津，復員交川省辦理。（十二）國立榮昌師範，校址在榮昌，復員交川省辦理。（十三）國立四川水產職校，校址在合川，復員計劃：原校停辦，校產交川省接收。（安）通者，報紙捐載立法　已體　現時公敎人員之苦難狀况，向行政院建議，改善公敎人員待遇辦法，以每月津貼二十萬元，底薪一千倍爲範疇，提案公佈，輿情興奮。然據報紙透出消息，國防會踷公，認爲若照立法院建議辦法實行，則預算之龐天，將用天文學數字記錄，獨不思通貨膨脹，法幣價値之渺小，已須用微分學計算。吾人以爲今日政府斷無理由可以拒絕立法院之調整建議。據立法院調整薪津提案，說明謂工人工資已達三千倍，生活必需品如米糧燃料布匹房屋價格已漲至五千倍至一萬倍，原案主張薪水倍數爲一千倍，生活補助費爲二十萬元，已顧到政府之實際負担能力，政府豈可忽視此種事實，而置公敎人員生活於不籟。吾人今日特再鄭重宣言，政府其述接受立法院情理　　之　整　　。自三月份起，即便實行·不然同仁等爲生活計，爲敎育計，容或採取較怠敎更爲有効之辦法云云。</p>

<h3>中行猛力壓制黑市　金價漲後即回　最高曾出兩百完關</h3>
<p>烚赤昨國內局勢更形惡化，傳說更甚，本市有中行調節，市價低於全國各埠過鉅，以致各路客帮，各式游資，集中向黃金進取，最高漲到二百萬元以上，中行被迫除配給外，再向黑市作緊急拋售，堅後始起反動，晨開微　，關後即挺，惟一九五萬左右，一度稍事勾留，十時後已穩站一九六萬以上，中行對同業登記之四五〇條，（臨時取消二十五條）以一九七萬配給四二五條，迨配售竣事後，投機帮一貫作風，市價立被掀動，抬高至二三萬新高峰，中行至此予打擊以打擊，在黑市中猛拋一千餘條，壓力空前加重，使一役投機份子，透不過氣來，一轉瞬間跌過開盤價，見一九一萬低價，一般未登記者，級問幫南北行餘資，仍有收購，曾回上至一九五萬左右，無如回風已起，多方了結，加之津幫買意已止，中行壓力仍重，不進則退，午後終破一九〇萬大關，退至一八六萬低價，而後稍穩，結果較上週六回跌一萬，三時後又做隔日交劃，喊高至一九〇萬外，飾金掛牌二〇萬二，紋銀一千七，銀元一一八〇元有賣，暗拆以銀根寬鬆，息價自一角半左右至一角八分不等。</p>
<h3>時局影響公債　開後逐步盤落</h3>
<p>公債以政局動盪，買氣銷沉，雖有證券大戶某號發起吃敲，吸引游資，仍難振作，統丙自六六〇〇元逐步盤落，午刻在六千元關邊掙扎，結果較前收下跌五五〇元，甲乙丁戊亦跌五〇〇元左右。</p>
<h3>紗綫俱新高價　現棉交易大暢</h3>
<p>昨日紗市兎起　落，晨初承上日劇漲之餘威，及金價衝出二百關外之消息傳來後，粗細紗綫無不瘋狂上升，二十支特雙馬最高曾見一百四十萬，四十二支雙股藍鳳綫亦做至二百六十五萬，俱係本年度之新高價，然均曇花一現，不旋踵間金價回落，申新等廠逢高拋售，計開二十支雙馬價一百三十五萬，同行相繼吐售，至收市價仍較上週末高五六萬元，惟四十二支綫各牌收市價反降三兩萬元，午時紡建照例開紗，十支以上粗紗計漲一萬至四萬，二十支漲九萬，三十二支至一百支綫漲十六萬至二十萬，承購者不甚踴躍</p>
<p>布市客帮與門莊需要蠢動，市勢一致向榮，除士林布平定外，其餘各牌均漲一二千元不等。</p>
<p>花市紐約美棉微漲一至九磅音，計近期美金二七·一六，遠期二七·七一，米特林現貨二七·七六，本埠現棉銷暢價昂，申新第一廠辦進米特林，烏拉圭，巴西花一千三五百包，同業互做亦甚多。</p>
<h3>美鈔隨金進退　套買交易頗盛</h3>
<p>外幣美鈔隨金市進退，套買較股，套頭自八百元對十兩，逐漸軋攏十餘元，晨開二四一〇元後一再拉高至二五〇〇元以上，迨金市回落，午後曾回跌至二三七〇元，而後穩定，結果較上週六微降十元，套頭最後軋近至七八七元半對十兩，港票存底極涸，不易收羅，老貨更少，較上週六漲起十元，港電自四三〇元升至四四〇元外，羅比五四〇元，美　掛牌仍平，指定銀行對做賣意寥寂，需二千一以上，凍結匯票，結予中行價二千元，代手銀行需佣十元。</p>
<h3>台灣銀行　滬行開業</h3>
<p>辦理小額匯兌</p>
<p>台灣銀行上海分行昨日在百老匯路行址成立開業，據該行經理謝惠元告本所記者云，前敵之台灣銀行，經接收改組竣事，今由我政府經營辦理，仍名台灣銀行，其台北總行及全台十餘個分支行，均於昨日正式成立，並根據敵所發行之三十餘億台幣，現由該行發行新台幣一楓滬台間商業　兌事，該行暫可辦　小錢匯兌，仍照台省長官公署所訂台省公職人員眷屬　寬辦法，以台幣一元折合法幣三十元為標準，今後滬台問一般商業　兌問題，該行將向中央銀行請示，調撥頭襯及如何規定匯率後，始可大量經營，目前該行仍執行普通銀行業務。</p>
<h3>茶市內銷堅挺　外銷一時不易發展成本超過美國市價</h3>
<p>連日本街店莊及無錫蘇州等地，鑒於低檔紅綠茶脫手異常活躍，因此胃納漸開，但高莊貨甚少，至於天津帮，去化依然呆滯，觀測目前情形，售價雖未前進，然後退亦不易，人心趨堅，　貨者大都待價而沽云。</p>
<p>據久興茶葉公司負責人吿聯合徴信所記者云：該公司前寄與美國歐文信託公司之祁紅樣面，近始獲得美方回覆，彼希望吾國之茶葉價格不要超過每磅三角五分美金，因美國對各類物品之進口，均有一規定標準，如比標準價格爲高之貨物進口甚爲困難，然滬市目前茶葉每磅如以美金三角五分出口實不可能，此價僅够向吾國產地購買，上海之市價，每磅刻需美金五角左右，故如欲出口，非在美金八角以上即無利潤可言，是以目前茶葉之　出貿易實難開展。</p>
<h3>衰氣籠罩股票市塲　物極必反前途大可慮</h3>
<p>華股大戶　而之他，對敲集團亦陸續有瓦解之象，間有放棄華股，轉做公債者，倍形冷落，金市俏後反動，中途一度回漲，但爲時至暫，午刻仍見低價，永紗自五二五〇元退至四八三〇元，美亞四一五〇元退至三六五〇元，景福三〇五元降至二五五元，新光二四八元降至二百元內，勤興二二五元退至一五五元，午收略穩，永安公司因在美國註冊，可避免納稅，有一贈九消息，雖跌而被一般出紗廠之逃買活動所拉住，結果較上週六跌半成强至一成不等，冷門小股及元老股所跌有限，外股亦被帶小，怡紗自一二二〇〇元，英聯一一一〇〇元，逐步下挫，午收較上週六續挫一成左右。</p>
<h3>木材市況穩秀</h3>

<h3>吳市長蒞任第一聲　抑平米價緊急措置　嚴查囤積準許舉發　禁止業外投機抬價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新任吳市長下車伊始，適値米價飛漲，對於如何抑平市價，調劑民食，一般市民，無不殷切盼望。</p>
<p>緊急會議商定對策</p>
<p>吳市長爰於昨日下午三時，即召開緊急會議，出席者除市府何秘書長德奎·社會局長吳開先外，到地方自治協會長杜月笙·市商會會長王曉籟·敵僞產業處理局局長劉攻芸·糧政處代表沈德仁·中央銀行副總裁陳行·銀行公會會長李銘·臨時市參議會徐寄廎·馮有眞，豆米業公會常務理事瞿振華張錫潮楊潤畬陳少廉·米號業代表萬墨林·豆米行業代表刑志剛吳蓉生朱永明顧益生等，由吳市長親自主持，先說明開會意義，次聽取米業代表陳述意見，最後共同決定本市米糧緊急措置辦法四條，交社會局即日執行，於五時散會。</p>
<p>保護糧商取締囤積</p>
<p>會議後，吳市長接見新聞記者：對此事發表談話，略謂本人對民食甚為重視，此次會議即爲欲解決此一問題，但根據各方調査，本市糧商存米爲五十餘萬石，市民存米三十餘萬石，總共爲九十萬石，以市需每月三十餘萬石計，估計可供三月食用，來源方面，蔣主席已飭四川裝運二百萬担米糧來滬供應，糧食部已向南美巴西訂購洋米七萬噸，另糧商亦訂購洋米二萬五千噸，國內產地米糧亦源源不斷來滬，故米價實不應上漲，其中顯然有圃積居奇投機操縱情事，本市今後糧食政策，在於保護正當糧商，取締投機囤積，爲此商定四點辦法，已交吳局長切實執行，並轉飭米商遵照。</p>
<p>四條辦法社局執行</p>
<p>其緊急措置辦法，四條如下，第一，限糧商於三日內向社會局登記本市存糧，定廿三日截止，嗣後如有增減，亦須向社會局分別登記，凡逾期或隱匿不報者，將予以沒收處分。並獎勵市民吿發，如經檢舉確實者，以囤米百分之五十充作獎金。第二，非米商不得經營米業，違者嚴辦。第三，每日交易，須由公會辦理登記交易者之姓名住址價格及交易數量，皆在詳報之列。第四，五月十日至二十日十天內米糧交易情形，須補辦呈報，以澈査此次上漲原因。社會局吳局長奉令後，即回局連發緊急命令數通，除嚴催倉庫業及銀錢業，迅將各會員堆棧存米，詳確迅速具報外，並佈告不准業外人非法買賣，如有隱匿不報，或所報不實者，准許人民舉發，即將私囤之米，一槪充公，並准以半數作爲獎金。</p>
<p>主席電令船糧免查</p>
<p>川米二百萬石已決定由民生，三北，及招商三輪船公司分段担任東運，蔣主席特令飭沿途軍憲免除檢査，市政府昨接奉行政院本月十八日電開，奉主席蔣眞電開，所有川江下駛運糧之船艦，應一律免除檢査，不得貽誤，除已電令軍憲檢査機關遵照外，希知照等因除分電外，特電遵照。</p>
<p>昨日米價跌五六千</p>
<p>昨日米市以內地略平，且連漲之後，價已太高，店方銷路見減，是以進胃轉懈，致粳秈元米均一致回跌五六千，麵粉亦隨之下挫四五百元，油市亦隨各物下降五六千元，黃豆小二三千元，生仁跌一二千元，芝蔴疲千元，豆餅供多於求，回小四五百元，各糧一致下降，均隨米價爲轉移，昨日本市到米，據米市塲息，共六千餘石，其種類及石數如下：白粳三九六五石，羊秈一三三石，薄稻七一一石，杜秈三五二石，早稻一三二二石，皖秈二四四石。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本市各米商在蕪湖所採購之秈米約有八十列車，每車約二百五十包，現正滯留南京，一俟獲得交通工具，即可分批裝運來滬云。</p>
<p>又訊：安南方面已開始接受米糧之訂購，當局正考慮接洽訂購，以便就近運銷本國解決民食云</p>
<h3>美國現極需要　中國生絲與桐油　派遣農業代表來華　調查運輸生產情形</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十九日電〕美國除將派遣農業代表團赴中國與菲律賓外，並將在五月中旬再這代表團至近東及希臘，此四個單位之農業代表團爲戰爭結束以來首先赴戰爭破壞區者，其任務係屬於視察性質，而其視察所得，將決定美方未來技術援助與指導之範圍。</p>
<p>赴華農業代表團係於最近宣佈者，該團此次赴華係應中國政府之邀請，將留華工作五個月，擬與中國政府取得密切之合作，在採取立即行動應付緊急問題及復興爲日人破壞之中國農村經濟長期計劃方面，該團將貢獻其意見。</p>
<p>該團之目標雖屬長期性質，但其較爲重要者亦將立即予以注意，就後者而言，中國爲套取外匯儘付其所需之進口貨計，必須　出生絲與桐油，按美國現極需要生絲與桐油，因此對於此項原料運輸與生產延擱之癥結，美代表團將予以調査，此種緊急援助，就代表團之長期目標而言，實係例外之工作，事實上，在就地援助方面，聯合國善後救濟總署之技術人員已予以執行，至於中國緊急復興工作所需之原料與配備、聯總亦已儘量供給，此外，舉凡適合兩國政府合作之農業復興計劃，代表團將予以提出建議，同時，在協助重建中國農業方面，該團亦將負責指定各種計劃，人員。配備及機構。</p>
<p>目前已發表之名單僅團長赫吉生博士一人而已，赫氏現任加利福尼亞大學副校長，同時對於絲茶·桐油等方面亦極有研究。</p>
<p>某團員就該團目標一言以蔽之曰：「在空虛的肚子上，不能建立世界和平」，另一團員則認爲，在鞏固世界諒解及消弭各種族與思想之不同點方面，代表團乃係一和平之工具。</p>
<h3>印美棉相繼到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華綸洋行經理之哈斯定司號，於上星期抵滬，由美運來棉花一萬二千餘件，現泊隆茂棧碼頭起卸，又大英輪船公司經理之　姆直亞號，由印度喀拉基運棉花二萬五千五百件，雜貨三千八百噸，聞其中有鐵路材料甚夥，昨已抵吳淞口，因港無泊處，暫在口外拋泊，待有泊處再進口卸貨。</p>
<h3>白煤步跌</h3>
<p>白煤因上海秦皇島間海運暢達，運費減低，到貨續增，其間以陽泉煤最多，新近運滬之長城白煤亦不少，故市價在百物昻貴中，反見新低價，焦作白煤到存均薄，行情雖穩，銷路則大受影響，烟煤屑廠方逢低有吸，故市况又見振作，市價堅挺，柴炭因米糧價貴，產價報漲，又加近日到貨較淡，行情繼續喊高。</p>
<h3>綢均回漲</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲市，一二〇號天橋有光，開盤一百四十五萬元，後因金價昻升，跟踪上騰，最大喊一百五十三萬元，終因買戶乏力，金便亦回，遂降下至一百四十六萬元收盤，下午又喊短四萬元，結果較上週末漲起七八萬元，廠經市價堅穩，洋行無交易，用戶絲蘇州客辦進中級五担貨，價一百九十萬至九十五萬元，干經價未做開，喊價與上週末相仿，綢貨美亞被面每百條漲起四五萬元，大誠格子璧縐漲起一百元疆</p>
<h3>桐油有到無銷　內銷貨價狂跳</h3>
<p>足度白油近日各處續有到埠，雖無大數量，但實銷不良，出口　途仍屬暗淡，故價格略呈軟弱，內銷桐油如西洪吉盈豐，存底寥寥，價竟跳至十二萬五千一桶，西洪雜牌，則源源有到，價瀉八萬關內，聞江浙方面新貨，足度白油，業已登塲，桐油價格，有江河日下之勢。</p>
<h3>第五次標售物資　今日下午開標</h3>
<p>中央信託局代理出售政府物資財產委員會第五次標賣物資，計有十一類標號，包括棉紗細布府綢人絲等，投送標函以今日上午十二時止，下午二時開標。又第三次標賣物資，尙有人絲二一一箱一三八小包，細布一，一六〇疋，四二支藍鳳雙股綫七六草包，因最高標價低於內定底價，按中信局標賣章程得重行招標，故已併於第五次標資，聞第四次　　物資，得標者係大豐紗布號，大中，駿孚，同泰昌，九豐，源泰昌，正信，申和順等八家，聞第四次尙有三二支地球紗四十件，一二〇號雜牌人造絲五〇〇箱包未標出。</p>
<h3>廣州貿易停頓</h3>
<p>廣州在載前，為華南對外貿易要港，今則對外貿易猶在停頓之中主要原因在於幣制之尚未穩定，級捐稅之　重，港幣黑市價大增，使　入益惑困難，廣州商人，不能向本地申請外匯，須向上海申請，故商人責有煩言。</p>
<h3>財部維護國內產業　土紗布出口免稅　進口貨稅率一斑</h3>
<p>頃悉財部爲維護國內產業，對於運銷國外之手工業品，如土布土紗等，均免稅出口，至進口稅率，視其貨品之性質而定，茲探悉其日常進口貨之稅率如下：</p>
<p>（一）機器進口稅率依其性質分爲百分之七至百分之十。（二）棉布針織品以及呢絨等，其稅率自百分之二十五至百分之四十，（三）奢侈品多數不准八口，允許進口者其稅率特重，例如捲烟應納關稅統稅，以及奢侈附加稅達百分之二百。</p>

<h3>桂省的急務！救饑·整吏</h3>
<p>— 本報桂林十五日航訊　特約記者梁小中寄</p>
<p>日子踏入了夏季的大門，愁苦的人們仿佛移轉了一點　惡的命運，季節風從印支度那半島帶來一片　深的雨雲。甘霖普降，省境到處喜雨，老太婆連聲南無阿彌陀佛，絕了望的農夫忙着把犁扒掛上肩頭，流着汗把涇　的泥土翻起，「布殺啊！」布殺島也忙着替人叫了。但是希　鳥那裏知道貧苦的農民災難重重，糧耔要借，犁扒要借，肥料要借，左右江一帶賽如神明　子的耕牛普遍地又發了瘟疫。雨下得那未可愛，農民的而上也那未難得眞正的笑一塲！種耔還沒有着落，希望　在人們的心裏發了一點幼芽，一塲風暴又來了，配購軍糧七萬四千。八百大包，一十五萬市担的命令比火還急，催征，催繳，米糠裏還要榨出一點水份說起來有點悲哀，請求緩減，只換來一個摸不着頭腦的答覆。前幾年借的糧沒有還，政府正要歸還的時候，來了一個征集軍糧的命令，於是順便一撥，借去的變了征去的。以前沒有糧借的，現在一樣要從家裏拿出來，還要趕快的拿。就溢樣。軍糧，民食相互牽纏的不解緣，也把許多人的喉嚨勒得更緊了。</p>
<p>一局棋　實不高明</p>
<p>新雨過後，物價（尤其是糧價）曾經普遍的下跌，桂中米價的最高紀錄，曾經達到九萬元一市担，現在已經回到了三萬至四萬之問，桂林米價也相當穩定，最平的是南寗一帶，只賣二萬多元，有一點令人感到離奇不解的，是同一省境之內，各縣會各自禁止糧食流通到他縣去調節，而且是皇皇明文，嚴禁流通。於是弄到缺糧的縣份，米價跌不了幾天，馬上又束山再起，不但是米，一切雜糧都是如此，結果弄到荒者愈荒，足者不足，（足糧的地方，爲了禁止出口，於是產生了走私，囤積，觀望的現象，因而也刺激了糧價的上漲，你明白商人是最敏感的），一方面熱情地捐款救災，一方面殘酷地禁糧外運，道一着棋，下得實在太不高明！</p>
<p>大股匪　越來越兇</p>
<p>米糧傷腦筋，還有一樣更傷腦筋。靑黃不接的時期，盜賊越來越兇，越來越多，其嚴重實不可以「誇張」二字視之。出沒西江貴縣與及貴（縣）賓（陽）盤據的一大股匪帮，儼然是一枝機械化的武裝武力，有重機槍，輕機槍，迫擊砲，美式衝鋒槍，輜重隊，月前洗刧了公路上的一批汽車後，旬前行駛西江的輪船兩艘又遭了殃，護航自衛隊與土匪在貴縣下五十里展開血戰。結果，水手乘客多人死傷，匪徒搶到了三隻駁船的貨物，値四千餘萬，呼嘯而去。還有不知多少鄕村給他們一個個地支解，據說聚集不下有四千多人，以舊日的漢奸李某爲首，曾從日軍的手上拿來不少武器。維持地方治安的團隊，武力單薄，不但柬手無策，（當然剿是努力的剿，剿得去剿不去又是一個問題）而且縣城有時候也會多少有點風聲鶴唳。越桂邊境，則有所謂「人民自衛軍」流竄荼毒，越南的「革命軍」又到內地來招兵買馬，情勢光怪陸離，看起來的確有點着急，推原究始，大抵是飢餓兩字造成如此的形勢。</p>
<p>下坡路　走不得！</p>
<p>今日挺而走險的人，已經到了不以險爲險的程度，甚至在山中割草的女人，也竟然會爲了一袋米，把過路的孤客用鐮刀殺死。淸一次鄕，固然可以淸除不少的卷民，但是反作用多少總會造成一點「逼上梁山」的現象，安得淸鄉的官吏個個都是淸水冰鏡？所以今日的廣西的政治，不但要「救飢」，同時還要「整吏」。舉一個最小的例：譬如金秀　區設局局長敖永齡，將救濟麵粉　來全部在柳州出賣肥已，經人民檢舉後，只記大過一次，也就曾經引動若干清誠。我們謹在此誠懇的說一句：「下坡路萬萬走不得」！</p>
<p>分署長　臨電哭呈</p>
<p>自從中央社發出賑濟特使胡佛將來桂林一行的消息後，這兒一羣飢餓的人眞是望眼欲穿，大家心裏都在想：「假如胡佛眞的來桂林看一次，我們一定不只是得到這末一點的救濟。但是胡佛先生却使人失望了。人們另外聽到的一個消息，却是說救濟分署黃署長榮華打了一個急電到南京去，電文如下：「急，南京救濟總署蔣署長……（上路）本省所收麵粉三千噸，米一千噸，無濟於事。飢民數千圍署請願，幸未鬧事，萬懇多運糧食，來桂救濟，否則請給棺材三百萬具，並另賜職一具，臨電哭呈，死罪死罪。職黃榮華卯養叩」。</p>
<p>如今，大家都在靜靜的等候。</p>
<h3>蒙難盟機師印象　枇杷成熟時節一段史實</h3>
<p>— 本報十六日蘇北通訊　程鐵安</p>
<p>「…九架銀色的B24型機，從菲律律濱的某空軍根據地奉令出發，偵察長江流域敵艦挺動靜，各自奮翅飛往指令地帶，去完遂它們的任務。我們十一個人駕駛的一架飛機，第六次被指往滬，海（海門），通，澄，啓（啓東）等一帶江面巡察。六月十四日的子夜，灣灣的新月，揭開不破漆黑的夜氛，伸張着巨翼的神鷹，它衝冒談談的月色，在靜靜的長江面上翱翔，盤旋在死了的靑龍港上空，一艘灰色的小艇，被我們發現在港外的海面。照明彈從飛機上擲了下來，為了要辦別是中國的民船？還是敵寇的軍用艇？高速度的傾斜，俯衝到了長江的波面，汽缸突然爆炸了，急急仰首高飛時，半空中飛機已完全着火燃燒。我們前輪的三個奮身由窗口躍下，得到當地貴國鄉民的救助，保全了生命。其他的八個弟兄，是慘遭粉身了……」</p>
<p>這是一個蒙難盟機師自述的一架盟機於去年六月墜落蘇北宋季港的始末。</p>
<p>冒雨訪問　冷不了沸騰情緒</p>
<p>一個下雨的日子去，年六月十六日記者以某種機綠得晤及墜落宋季港（與靑龍港同爲蘇北海門縣之主要商港）的，三位盟機師。此時的心緒，受了突發性的激動爲了表示慰問之意，密陣陣的雨，也冷落不了沸騰的情緒，決定冒雨前去訪問。買了滿筐澄黃的新鮮枇杷，僅有這一些算作了慰勞品。捲起了褲管，踐着泥濘的黃泥小道，向着目的地走去。　沿途經過數度盤詰，吿知原委後，都被通過了。進得那家屋裏，黑壓地擒滿了人，人叢中，記者找到了盟機師，同時更碰到了權充翻譯，有救助盟友偉功的舊同學Ｅ君。盟友中的一個，額角受了傷，綳着紗布，雙目周圍紫腫，兩腿上擦破的傷痕，搽上了紅藥水。他們都呆呆地坐着，臥着。默不作聲。等我們把帶去的枇杷，呈獻在他們的面前時。險上始露出感激似的微笑，慢慢地更啓開了話鋒。</p>
<p>盟國機師　歷述自已的身世</p>
<p>受傷的盟機師，他最肯健談，他吿訴記者說：是美國Okio　州人，名呌勒特蒙，Darnil　W.Redmon，父親是一個擁有資產的律師，共有兄弟五人，都為國效力了，母親因此受到榮譽獎章。他的哥哥在奪回菲島時，空戰陣亡。現年二十一歲，航空學校畢業後，服務空軍任駕駛員，中尉階級。他爲國，爲世界，爲全人類，效勞己三年了。其餘的二個盟友，他們始終如有無限心事在心頭似地，不發一言。我們但知他們一個呌迦羅道Alber　t　L.Garuto，是電報員。一個呌納思達，Mawin　R.Nester　，是機械師，畢業於華盛頓中學，復入航空學校受訓。</p>
<p>盟機師簽名式</p>
<p>（上）電報員迦羅道，（中）機械師納斯達，（下）駕駛員勒特蒙。</p>
<p>菲島飛來　帶橡皮船降落傘</p>
<p>勒特蒙講述着他們降落着地後，在乾了的小河內，躱在茅草叢中潛伏了幾小時。第二天，天未明時，東奔西走地，在田野中，摸索不着路徑，後由鄕民的引路，背馱（受偽的他，當時不能行動），躲入當地僞鄉公所內）鄕長僞（軍天良未滅）。敵軍嚴厲的搜索，他們窒息在鄕人的柴房內，爲了避衆人耳目，而移居E君家裏。然後再設法護送到此。勒特蒙言下對於鄕民表示無限感謝，同時對於自己的遭遇認爲是一種非常的奇遇。</p>
<p>「你們由菲島到此的航程，需多少時候？」</p>
<p>「機油加足了，飛機能航行四十小時。由菲來回此間，約須二十八小時（疑聰誤或記憶錯談）那麽我們就有十二小時的時間，可從容完成我們的任務。」</p>
<p>「飛機上的武器配備呢？</p>
<p>「除飛機上各種必須配備外，另裝有小射擊砲一門，重機槍二挺，輕機槍八挺，還有炸彈……</p>
<p>「我們躍下時隨身帶的橡皮船，降落傘……鄕民協助我毀掉……」他更這樣地補充一句。</p>
<p>言後，他給我們看我國航空委員會發給他們的護照，以及中英會話互譯小册子，血型銅牌，美國火柴……。喃喃地加以解釋。</p>
<h3>觀音山血跡彈痕　隨軍出發巡視實錄</h3>
<p>— 南通十四日　通訊　燦靈</p>
<p>幾天前，早就有着這樣一個打算，實地看看經過砲火刦餘的觀音山（小海觀音）戰地的情景，但是爲了一個人不能單獨地去，即人多也不能去，如果沒有武裝同志同行的話，雖然人家未必要想加害於你，可是往往有些人的死是遭不測的，同時也沒有機會，日子一多，也就淡忘了。</p>
<p>忽然機會來了，聽說國軍Ｘ連奉令出巡觀音山一帶，我得到這個好消息，連忙跑到連部和李連長商洽，得到了許可和他們一同出發。蜿蜒的　伍，在暖和的陽光下，沿着海　在平坦的道路上前進着。李連長要給我騎脚踏車我說，「能跑路，一齊步行的好」。</p>
<p>碧紗似的麥浪中　一步步行進</p>
<p>靑黃色的麥楷，已支撑不住行將成熟的麥穗，皆彎下了頭。微風中麥芒的浪，好像一片碧紗的波紋。</p>
<p>爲了麥田高的原故，部隊恐再遭突然的偸襲，李連長命令兄弟們槍上肩，彈上了膛，注意四方村莊屋頂上的目標。弟兄們個個精神抖擻，談論着打仗的經騐，不時發出一片歡笑聲，但他們的眼睛始終是注視前方。</p>
<p>走了四里路，過了三道橋，李迎長用手指着一塊麥楷倒斷的麥田，吿訴我這是國軍增援觀音危急的砲兵陣地。他一路上，吿訴我他們的共軍戰鬥的陣勢。他邊說邊用手指着那一個村屋是國軍據點，那一個村屋是共軍的據點。共軍是如何來包圍他們的，他們又如何奪取共軍的據點，最後因共軍砲火猛烈，他們一個迎是如何相互掩護撤退的，他又指着沿路的許多屍坑，那一個是國軍的，那一個是共軍的。麥楷上，靑草上，斑斑的血跡，已被太陽晒成焦黑的顏色了，行軍中的弟兄們，看到了許多屍坑，血跡，便講出許多英雄的故事來。</p>
<p>太平寺內不太平　菩薩也遭難</p>
<p>抵達觀音山，就是戰塲了。國軍的據點是太平寺，太平寺位在觀河鎭南的半里許是三面環水，綠蔭庇下的一個淸靜幽雅的所在，淸楚地記得一年前我從家鄕來城，每次經過這裏時，太平寺是一座古老色調的紅牆白壁的寺院，如今在敵寇屈膝投降之後，偏偏太平寺內不太平。經過一天一夜砲火連天的轟擊，只剩着幾支殘斷的幹柱和椽樑，遠望去宛如支架着的一個木籠頽垣敗壁，泥塑佛像僅存三五尊而已。幾棵高聳雲霄的銀杏樹，一棵斷了一根支幹，禿着枯焦的頂，一棵被倒擊在河中，只剩二棵仍綠蔭蔽天，顯映着刦後的餘輝。太平寺本有一所初級小學，房屋共有廿餘間，緊靠河西邊三間小屋，和西南角一個樓亭，幸能安然無恙，屋內住有年老夫婦，老婦人看見我們，未待我們開言發問，就吿訴我說：這幾天，天天有民兵來拆牆爬壁，聽說要將這些木料拆光搬走。我再三懇求他們不要拆，民兵狠狠地打我幾記耳光，說，我求不拆房子，是想再留給國軍住的，現在連我住的三間小屋也要拆，可憐我老夫妻這兒住不成了！他說到這裏，眼淚一直不住地往淌。</p>
<p>軍帽軍服在霉爛　屍肉變肥料</p>
<p>小屋門前，有一塊新的碎土。她又吿訴我說：「這裏面是埋的國軍的屍體，二十七日，新四軍衝進來，把碎泥翻開，將國軍死屍拖出來，把屍身上的衣服完全剝去，然後再埋在裏面的。」</p>
<p>太平寺的西北角，有大墳塲一塊，是共軍圍攻國軍的陣地之一。現在這上面多　了不少的屍坑，這幾個屍坑，腿部和頭部，仍露在土外，無數的蛆，在屍肉上蠕動，臭氣逼人，不可向邇。新鮮的泥土上面，茁畏着靑靑的小草，這腐臭的屍肉恰好是靑草的肥料。靑草堆裘，河邊上，麥田裏，發現狼藉着幾套正在霉爛的灰色軍服和軍帽。在一棵銀杏樹下，有一個很大的國軍葬墳。我站在墳旁憑弔片刻，不禁凄凉地感傷起來。</p>
<p>十戶九閉家家空　市面呈蕭條</p>
<p>附近的麥田裹，樹幹上，屋頂上，牆壁上，都是槍彈的痕跡，或是爲砲彈擊穿的大祠。農家的門都關得緊緊的，也見不到有一個農夫在田塍上跑，戰爭雖已結束了有十餘天，可是這一帶，仍是恐怖，悽慘，和殘酷的氣氛。　觀河鎭上，市面冷落蕭條，十戶九閉，十室九空，僅有鐵店二家在叮叮噹噹打着鐵，熔爐裏生着熊熊的火沒有一個行人，在鎭上歇息片刻。</p>
<p>據一個年近花甲的老翁吿訴我說：共軍來打太平寺，常夜被國軍打死了很多，隨時招回，用船裝送山芋頭而去，只知聽說共軍傷亡慘重，但不知有多少數目。二十七日早晨，共軍到鄉拆老百姓家的門窗，拉伕子，盒木柵和布疋去抬運傷兵。夜裘又到鎭上打開老百姓的門，用刺刀威嚇，勒迫說出鎭上和國軍有關係的人，同時順手拿雲端了被，鞋，襪和香煙等東西。全鎭老百姓在槍林彈雨中，裹着被子俯地而睡，大家都不敢聲張一語。現在鎭上年靑的都逃到城襄去了，有的躱到遠處親戚家裏去，所幸老百姓死傷不多，眞算運氣呢！」老者說到這裏，面上露着安慰似的笑容。</p>
<p>時間已是十二點了，在戰地觀覽了約四十分鐘，漫長的行列仍循着原路，於一點返抵通城。</p>
<h3>磺溪一浴</h3>
<p>— 台灣十二日航訊　美純</p>
<p>拔海四百五十米的大屯山，雄峙在台省的北邊，與〔台灣脊樑〕的中央山脈並非一支；她是從日本經琉球過台島而至澎湖，爲本省唯一的火山，小觀音山的舊噴火口的痕跡迄今仍在。</p>
<p>溫泉幾遍合省全島，僅以台北縣境，就有北投，草山，聖母，金山，烏來，宜闌，等溫泉，大屯山的前後左右當被這些溫泉環繞着。</p>
<p>由七星山，大屯山，紗帽山，竹仔山，面天山，菜公坑山，小觀音山組成的大屯山脈，在台北市街上，淸歷的看到她壯大的體魄。晴天淸晨，烟霧彌漫，淡淡地蒙着一層薄紗；有雲的午後，巒峯分明，甚至樹木都看得淸淸楚楚；欲雨的天氣，黯暗恍如濃雲；晨昏晦雨，給旅人以無限誘惑的魅力，素有「溫柔鄉」之稱的北投，就在她的身旁，嚮往已久的夢境，在今天畢竟躺在她的懷抱裏，度過値得寳貴的假日了。</p>
<p>溫泉種種　可治人間百病</p>
<p>北投在大屯，七星，紗帽等山三面環繞中。古爲硫黃產地，溫泉發現在廢淸光緒二十年。泉有泉三種湯：一，鐵之爲單純土類。五九度可治神經痛，僂麻質。斯，胃，咽喉氣管支諸加答兒，痔疾，惡性腫物，糖尿病。二，　之湯，爲酸性明礬泉，八六度，可治慢性皮膚病，潰瘍，腺病·三，星之湯，　費泉，含有　性　費本，可治　人病，內服　加答見，僂　質斯諸病恢復　等·從台北市去該地，如果坐汽車，三十分鐘直達，火車約四十分鐘可　北投。溫泉的地方很多，有的距離較遠，有的不知使用何種交通工具，更有友好們沒有去過，自已也不知怎樣去法。雖然知道草山溫泉在七星紗帽兩山溪谷聞，是一種硫黃泉，七一度，可治白濁白帶，，皮膚病，僂麻質斯，痛風，腺病，婦人病，二月桃花開時，是誘人最盛的時期，搭近郊公共汽車前往，相當的便利，如今遊客稀少了，已至冷落的季節。聖母溫泉在士林街三角埔，含有炭酸水的綠　泉，四五－五二度，可治貧血症，婦人病，神經系諸病。由於沒有定期的汽車，不大爲人們注意。其他溫泉，距離台北市稍遠，也就限制遊人的足跡。</p>
<p>台北淡水間，有鐵道支綫，每日上下有十六次車，北投是其中的一站。我同妻帶着孩子，搭乘相當擁擠的銀色公共汽車，到台北車站前下來，又匆匆的走進去，站內秩序整肅，內外淸潔，已一掃過去雜亂無章的景象，台幣四元購票兩張，十點二十分的車子，還有半點鐘，挨着先來旅客的後邊。靜待女査票員的啓柵軋票。入月台後，大家像競走似的，走過一道相當長的天橋，也就跟隨着男男女女的旅客，走進空停在北邊的列車。軌窄車小，椅墊或有，也很破爛，大都是賸着屍骸般的木條，幸好還可得到坐的位置。各節不能貫通來往，也是一種別微之處。賣日報的老頭，賣氷棒的小孩，挑着擔子進來賣雞蛋糕的少婦，點綴在人叢裏，倒不像其他各省，在車上賣東西的人高聲呌喊；拿着報紙在手裏賣的，是我到台以後第一次見到，像京滬一帶報販邊走邊喊，帶着緊張神態，而相互競爭賣報的，這兒根本就沒有，並且不興</p>
<p>出了市廛　台南新榖登塲</p>
<p>第一站大正街，已廢未停。經雙連稍佇，漸離市廛，花樹扶疏，田禾如茵，農人匍匐耘草，台南已獲新榖，酷暑佔有了全台。逾圓山渡基隆河，依山傍水，完全行經鄕間；晴嵐色黛，綠樹蔭翳；淡水河上，漁舟三五飄浮，原野廣衾，偏多紅瓦村舍，恍若置身在汨羅江畔，又如寄足桂省，夢寐徒勞，早成往跡，誰知此景此情，正是孤懸海外的美麗島上？士林是一小鎭，有客上下。台省鐵路站名的排列，是從左到右，到哄里岸時，我以舊有習慣續「岸里唭」，妻稱是「哄里岸」，兩人笑了一陣。北投下車的，幾幾乎有半數，都是例假來溫泉休息的。</p>
<p>所謂北投溫泉，是在新北投和頂北投，原有鐵路支綫，是在戰時，又被羅掘俱窮的日本人拆去了。隨情人走，穿過北投的街道，類似奉化溪口的小鎭。行約二華里，花草芬芳，間有居戶，過一水泥橋，就是入山的地方，溫泉旅社築在山腹，隨勢起伏，高低不一，掩映在綠樹叢中。車道盤旋上達，遠遠的好比一條白茫茫的川。滿山花樹，四園常錄，沿途有池，有亭，有橋，有坐椅，有茶室，任憑旅客是怎樣的享受。熱泉湯川，衝擊崢嶸的怪石，潺潺有聲，激起的飛沫，四濺狀如銀花。硫黃水經流的處所，堆着黃色的結晶，北投街上，也有出售硫花硫油的店家。明礬泉流處，水中的碎石，都給染上一層可愛的綠色。</p>
<p>旅社溫泉　分成男女兩部</p>
<p>旅社裏的溫泉，是用瓦管導進來的，蓄於池內，旁有冷水，供給浴客調節溫度。熱泉流處，據說還有魚類生存，人們却因太熱不敢伸手，如果燙雞毛，煮雞蛋，倒也便當。官立的公共浴堂相當講究，民有的未免簡陋，分成男女二部，一墻隔開，不能望也不可及，據談不是純粹和式。台省沐浴，不能有揚，鎭那樣消閒自在，只是單純的洗洗而已。澡金只台幣一元，池水不能浸泡全身汚穢，僅能用一只木盆盛水一洗再洗，冷熱聽便。旅館名稱都換成接近國人的口味了，內容還是和式的，一等房間每人台幣二十五元，有少女招待茶水，除去入浴，當然是供旅客住宿的。日人俱已返國，現由台人向縣府承租經營。我們在月明旅社闢室後，閱坐在椅上，啜着台省出產的紅茶，眺望山野，幽邃且覺靜溢，意味「偷得浮生半日閒」詩句，也慶幸自已飄逸的情緒。室隅懸有一幅入浴圖，描繪一個女子替男人大擦其背，無異宣傳廣吿。常來北投的人談，晚間入浴，是能找到伴洗女郞的。某君二月前來北投洗澡的時候，竟有一日本少女開門同浴，反使某君感覺有點難爲情，她倒滿不在乎的洗罷自去。</p>
<p>凋零冷落　美處不可抹殺</p>
<p>溫泉浴，水略有硫黃氣，洗罷，用冷水衝身，覺得有說不出的淸爽。</p>
<p>來北投的人，有的休息在旅館裹，有的躺在林野間，也有坐在溪畔呆呆看水流的。我們浴後在山間的碎石道上，邊談邊玩，看到日本自殺飛機的殘骸，和些沒有用塲的防空洞，荒蕪了的競馬塲，失去泡子的電燈柱，靜靜的山林，微有鳥雀的啁啾，這過去的「大屯國立公園」，如今是在凋零中有點冷落，但是還不能抹煞她的美處－那樣靜靜地透露着春情。</p>
<p>歸來，坐着交通車，很迅捷的在柏油路上行駛，過了中山橋，風景秀麗的劍潭，護國寺是在密密的林裏消失了，我們又回到了市區。</p>
<p>簽名留念　並盼望後會有期</p>
<p>時間趕走了白聲，我們須要走了，讓他們　　　休　。臨走時，每人請他們簽了償名，留作紀念。</p>
<p>第二天，天已放晴，記者打道回，家途過某鎭，日本陸軍部佈吿，高貼在牆上：</p>
<p>「六月十四日，米機一架，　落於宋季港，米機師二名逃走，（他們但知二名）無論何人拿獲送部，每名賞洋一百萬元…」。</p>
<p>又是枇杷成熟的季節了，我懷念他們，是否已到達祖國的家園，投入了他親人的懷抱？我祝福他們：永遠無恙，更希望二「後會有期」。</p>

<h3>聾子福音　聽演說　並聆歌聲</h3>
<p>聾子能够聽演說嗎？？在科學萬能的今日美國，是可能的。</p>
<p>美國新發明儀器一種，可使聾子聆聽名人演詞。任何人在講筒中致詞，其音浪經過特種儀器，即有各種符號反映銀幕上，使聾子一目瞭然。此亦望梅止渴，慰情聊勝千無之一法也。</p>
<p>據發明者貝爾電話公司稱：此種儀器，不特可傳播演詞，且可將歌聲用符號介紹與聲者，符號而代替歌聲，雖可媲美梅妻鶴子，但未必能一歷聾子之「音樂慾」也。詳情可參看這裏所刋的圖片。</p>
<p>又據英國新聞處倫敦二十日電：「此間最近展覽一具助聽新發明，靈巧如香烟匣，長三吋，闊二吋，高一吋，裝有三揚聲活塞，一耳套，與乾電池數枚，每小時耗電，尙不到一便士。</p>
<p>展覽時，由一患重聽之人戴上試騐。據稱：一切均淸晰可聞。</p>
<p>此項新發明，乃英國郵政總局倫敦硏究所之功蹟，大致將爲英全國新健康業務採用。硏究所主任闌德來博士稱：「此種實騐成功之模型堪與英美最新型助聽器媲美，其所生診療效果，則更駕於一切之上。」（一）某參議員在講筒中致詞，</p>

<h3>生產一得</h3>
<p>— 鐘鳴</p>
<p>距住家不遠，有　若一，廟裏住着幾個和尙，幾個香工，生活高漲到了極點，他們的生意也清淡到了極點。因爲一　佛事，動輒好幾萬，這究竟不比什麼日用品，能省的大家就省省了。和尙閒着無事做，香工也閒着無事做壽，但是他們的吃喝，不能像青罄紅魚般的擱置在一旁。</p>
<p>他們爲了生活，也就不能不大動其腦筋了，於是收拾出了幾間僧房，分租給人家，這就有了一筆房租收入。後園有兩畝荒地，一向閒棄着，最近動員了全體僧人香工，把一部分的地爬鬆了，施以肥料，種下青菜莧菜。不到幾個星期，灰褐色的泥土上，滿生了青青的嫩蔬，荒地變成熟地，不但可供自己佐餐之品，餘下的還可賣給人家，換得一部分的食糧。</p>
<p>當他們在耕地施肥之時，我得閒走去參觀，在休息時間撩天，談到工作時一部分的用具，多數是借來的，但是添置　頭，水桶，等物，也花了好幾萬塊錢。待到種籽播下之後，略施沃　，便一天一天長成了，因爲今年雨水多，灌水的工作，省却了許多人力，但是第一次的收穫，也只好貼補工具的代價。我看他們在流汗的工作裏，臉上浮着笑容，這一大片綠畦上的蔬菜，反映了他們內心的安慰。</p>
<p>我在綠畦間散着步，從輕鬆的脚步下想到生產不是空喊的力和汗的結晶。在夕陽西隊時，順便買了兩斤莧菜回家，下着面麵吃，覺得格外有滋味。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>熊貓</h3>
<p>— 許玉麟</p>
<p>英國瓁得我國贈送的熊貓，非常的珍視牠，特地用飛機載回去。外國人認爲能够獲得稀有的中國熊貓，是很幸運很光榮的事。但是這個給世界人士所珍視的小動物，雖然產生在我國，而國人對於本國光榮的特產熊貓，却並不予重視，更沒有外國人那般的感到興趣。</p>
<p>現在國內有許多事情，都和熊貓的命運相同。國人對於祖國的事情，都抱着冷淡的態度。譬如目前各地在鬧糧荒的恐慌，沒有受到飢餓災難的外國人在大聲替我們呼　，而本國的人民，除了身受災難的同胞感到切身的痛苦而發出呼救的哀號，其他生活比較優裕的同胞，都抱着　不相關的態度。似乎這不是祖國的痛苦，也難怪外國人要以「中國飢餓，上海跳舞。」的標題來刊登中國的情况了。</p>
<p>我國的同胞，缺乏國家觀念，有些事情，外國人在替我們憂愁，而我們自己却毫不在乎，這不但給別國瞧不起，實在使自己丟臉，我希望同胞們此後對祖國的事情，不論是痛苦的或幸福的，都予以注意，免得本國的事情，再讓外國人來關切。</p>
<h3>一言興邦</h3>

<h3>電車中體操</h3>
<p>— 盛善烱</p>
<p>這差不多已經成爲我的習慣了，每在早晨起身後，費去一刻鐘的時間，作種種徒手操。這樣，到現在我的瘦小的身體在不知不覺中强健起來。肌肉發達尙談不到，但是精神煥發，體力已超過常人了。並且減去許多常人易患的疾病，體操對我太有益了，使我對它激感和尊敬。</p>
<p>有一在爲了一些家事，睡得太晚，因此次日起得很晏，匆促地走出家門。平時我是步行到校的，那天爲了時間關係，衹得乘車了。車站上早已等滿了人，排成一條長蛇形。我也銜接上去，好像等待開拔的軍隊。一輛二輛，都擠滿了人開去了，好容易擠入第三輛。坐位當然是不能享受了，兩手握住橫槓，後來引擎開始顫動，我的雙手也握得更緊一點，馬路不平，車行時一起一伏，我把足跟提起，足尖着地，這樣可以減去强烈的震動。我想起來了：這是臂部和足部的運動。</p>
<p>過了幾站，車廂內已塞足了人，幾乎不能動彈，後面的衝勢太厲害了，這時我的兩手吊住木槓，兩足不能移動，衹得將肚子凸向前去。可是後來的乘客都是野心勃勃的，得寸進尺，我的肚子實在不能再向前了，身子有折成兩段的危險。我不得水利用我的屁股採取攻勢，費九牛二虎之力，才把身子站穩。但車一開，身體向左傾；車一煞，身體向左側。如果沒有抵抗力，很有遭駡的可能。這是臀部和腰部的運動。</p>
<p>後來車廂實在不能再容納了，經過小站，如果沒有人下去，也就不停了。我想這樣總可以相安無事，其實偏是多事之秋：右邊的一位，是年老的賬戶模樣，開始咳嗽了，却不用手帕掩住口，我爲避免傳染計，把頭向左轉，可是左邊的一位，看上去好像是個勞働者，是有口臭的，且喜大聲說話，我怎麼忍耐得住陣陣的異香，逼得我把頭又掉過來，這樣咳嗽停了來口臭，口臭停了來咳嗽，却忙了我的頭，左右旋轉不已，這是很適常的頭部運動。</p>
<p>不一會我的目的地到了，我開始蠢動，向空隙處進逼，擠出了車廂，走到學校。在走廊內，看見同學們正在談笑，知道還沒有上課，回想在車上擠得透不過氣來的情形，我噓了兩口氣，這是體操終止後的深呼吸。</p>
<p>還好，我沒有忘掉體操，不過不在家園內，而在車廂中。</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>點子戰</h3>
<p>— 德堅</p>
<p>間諜用以傳遞消息的工具，本甚精巧。至此次大戰爲止，允謂巧之尤巧了。點子戰的發明人，是在德國達累斯登地方的高等技術學校蔡潑敎授。其法以文件先寫在一正方紙上，以高度縮形照相器照之，使縮成一張郵票模樣，再經倒逆顯微鏡照之，就留一極小黑點在軟片上，再塗以化學膠液，並以注皮下層之針，剪去其尖頭，加以磨圓，撳在黑點上，黑點遂脫片而出。再以此黑點沒法編入紙張的纖維中之後，仍以紙纖維覆上，結果與打字機上所得的黑點，一般無二。其法良善，用心亦深。於是從南北美洲，寄往各國的情書，家信，商業信　等，看似平淡無奇，其實均佈有黑點。人不知鬼不覺而消息外洩了。</p>
<p>美國軍統局知道點子戰的出現，是由一個被軍統局派往漢堡，混入納粹偵探學校畢業的人，名呌　　。他在一九四〇年一月歸國。據他報告謂，在畢業賦別時，校長西暴博士對他們說：「我們的消息傳遞網在美國，將永無阻撓。這不待點子法的運用」言外頗　傲意。至於如何運用，則未加闡明。於是美國偵探界對於點子，就發生無上的疑惑，衹能極力注視事實的證明了。納粹的魔具，各外形似安全火柴，其實是能寫無形字的鉛筆，字跡可用藥品顯露。還有納粹在美國的領袖名單，盡在工人手裏的手帕上發見，還有皮鞋後跟裏，染有潛水艇的圖樣。這種種都被發現無遺。但點子的謎，仍無解答。</p>
<p>一九四一年八月，有一新自巴爾幹來美的青年旅行家，舉止闊綽，很像豪華子弟。當搜索他的行李文夾時，搜索人員徒覺太陽光射在信封上，有一奇異的及射光掠過。細騐之下，始知信上的黑點，頗有可疑。放在二百倍的顯微鏡下，一經檢騐，猛然發現下面一段的文件，謂：「美國現正利用氣來做原子能的研究工作，渴望獲得有關這方面的實騐報告。且（一）以何法移動很重的　？（二）何處從事此實騐？（學校或工廠）（三）尙需其他原料嗎？」另外在他的衣袋裏，又搜到四張空白的電報稿紙，上面佈有十一個黑點，及一狹長的軟片此片。黏在郵票背後，上影有書滿廿五張打字紙的文件，大意囑調查原子能的究竟，每月飛機的產量，以及運入英國，加拿大等地的架數，駕駛人員的訓練速度，於是點子之利用，至此大白。而納粹的消息傳遞網，遂吿失効。日本也曾利用點子，從東京傳遞消息到駐美海軍隨員。在一九四二年二月，因此被美國扣留達九十餘件信札。這種方法，一經揭穿，自歸失効。但竊念從事間諜活動者，豈肯從此而止其鬼技呢？日新月奇，我們且拭目觀之吧！</p>

<h3>作如是想</h3>
<p>— 陳志道</p>
<p>敎育第一，敎育的責任，御在誰的身上？——敎師，尤其是大學敎授，責任當然負得更重，但是他們的生活，及不上工人，餓着肚子，担子是挑不動的。</p>
<p>我上課時，一見幾位面有憂色的敎授們，就作如是的想着：他們這等學問；尙且如此，那末我們這輩後生小子，將來的出路，更不堪設想矣！</p>
<p>先生爲着生活担憂，學生爲着前途担憂，試問學業那會不爲打折扣？敎育程度上進呢，還是下退？「敎育第一」的口號喊到何時，才能眞正的使敎育達到第一？</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>羅斯福的童年</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>去年四月十二日逝世的美國前任大總統羅斯福，他的童年生活是平凡的。誠如他母親所說的一樣，在羅斯福的幼年時，實在和別的小孩沒有什麼兩樣。他的父母做夢也想不到他後來會做總統的。他的父母對於羅斯福的前途，不過衹希望他長大時和他的父親一樣，正直持重，公正仁慈做一個有「骨氣」的美國人而已</p>
<p>羅斯福是一個獨生子，當他母親生他時候，因爲難產的關係，用了大量的「哥羅方」，幾乎使他母子兩人因此致命。後來醫生以及他的親友們都以爲他是不會活長的。誰也想不到，他竟連了四任美國大總統。他的家境可說是很好的，住在美國赫特遜河濱附近的一個鄉村裏，他日常的生活是刻板而有程序的，通常是七時起身，八時進早餐，九時至十二時在家中讀書，功課完畢以後，到外面去奔走或遊玩一會，下午一時吃午飯，以後散一會步再讀書至四時，四時以後，他就可以隨時隨意的作各種心愛的運動和遊戲。因爲他是一個獨生子的緣故，總是一個人遊戲的時候多，他愛好奔跑拍球，更歡喜騎馬，當他身體稍微長大了些時，他便能馳行到荷蘭郡，引起了許多親友們的驚異和贊美。</p>
<p>他從很小的時候，就對射擊發生了極大的興趣和愛好。在十一歲的當兒，他從他父親那裏得到一枝獵槍，也因此在他許多的伴侶中，得到了射出能手的名聲。那時候他立意要在他自己的家中成立一個小小的博物院，包藏赫特遜河上的各種鳥類的標本，而每一樣都是由他自己親手從空中擊落的。不久，在他自己書房的紅木櫥上，已經滿藏了各式的標本，其中有金鶯、蒼　、知更鳥、啄木鳥，甚至還有一個鷹。</p>
<p>羅斯福還有一個習慣，在他幼時，常是命令他左右的同伴，他的理由是別人所想不到的。他底母親有一天當他又在命令別人的時候，就和他說。</p>
<p>「孩子，不要你常常的去命令別人也要別的孩子去發命令」</p>
<p>「媽媽！假如我不發命令，那就沒有一件事會做得像樣的，」他毫不狡猾地說。</p>
<p>由此看來，他從小就有領導和指揮他人的能力。</p>
<p>他從他底父親那裏，學習了很多的優良的嗜好，如搜集郵票就是其中的一種，也因此使他得到了許多地理上的常識。</p>
<p>有一天晚上，當他在把郵票分類黏貼的時候，他的母親在高聲讀書給他聽，可是他似乎並不十分注意的樣子。他的母親就放下了書責問他說：</p>
<p>「我想我念着的，你一個字都沒有聽進去吧？」</p>
<p>羅斯福立刻仰起頭來，並且在他的臉上也現出了古怪的笑容，他竟能把他母親剛才讀過的一節，完全背誦了出來。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>廉字有了心</h3>
<p>— 余惕</p>
<p>記得聊齋上有「三朝元老」一則，是以「孝悌忠信禮義廉；一二三四五六七。」這一付對聯來　駡宋朝貳臣趙孟　的「無恥」與「忘八」。</p>
<p>本來，「禮，義，廉，恥，國之四維；四維不張，國乃滅亡！」</p>
<p>不久以前，讀到自由談上一位先生的大作「無心之廉」，說「廉字沒有心」。但是，昨晚我打從二十四層樓附近走過，抬頭看見「禮，義，廉，恥」四字的霓虹管，已經完好無缺，心中感到一陣快慰。</p>
<p>希望從今以後，一般人民的公僕，個個都能够廉潔自好。使我們所崇尙的「禮義廉恥」四個字，不再打折扣。</p>
<h3>閩粤醖釀災荒</h3>
<p>— 魯明</p>
<p>入春以來，據各方面的報導，福建廣東等地，普遍發生苦旱的現象。尤其是閩南粵東一帶，連日炙陽如火當空，到處蕩漾着灼熱的氣息。這現象的確是歷年來所罕見的。大部分的春田，都因雨水的限制，未能播種，平時一級水利校好的田地，勉强還插得來的秧，到現在也被炎日晒壞了。氣候變得非常乾燥，水田　裏，農民對此發生極大的不安。　價跟着高飛猛漲，眼看這旱災的醞釀，一天一天的嚴重起來。</p>
<p>只要稍能明瞭農村狀况的人，就會感覺今年苦旱的威脅，已經到了嚴重的地步。農民在困苦中掙扎，他們不分晝夜，靠着單薄的人力，開溝挖井　水，但是，這樣辛勞的情形，畢竟不能持久的。　水漸漸涸渴，水井亦多洞底見泥。倘使再半月無雨，田野都要晒焦了。今春不能耕種，下半年度的糧食馬上發生恐慌。</p>
<p>在今日，中國的農村，經過一番刀兵役稅的洗刦後，普遍呈現破產的徵兆。而接踵在人民面前的，又是天災和　疫。在中國這樣科學落後的土地里，戰後的生產率和消費率，本已相差甚遠，再加上人口和分配的不平衡，便造成今日經濟恐慌的一大原因。單以糧食來說，許多淪陷光復的省份，生產力虛弱，本身不够自給，必須靠一般情形比較穩定的省份接濟。　　一省，在戰時的糧食勉强可以維持，但戰後交通恢復，外省逐漸向其吸收糧食，於是本省的糧食便　　起來。這樣的糧食問題，在中國原是普遍性的，一時未能解決，只有期望下半年度禾稼大熟，各省收穫，以圖補救。但是實際看來，戰後的復員，因種種關係，到現在尙未就緒，光復區的生產力仍未復元，倘使下半年度這些情形較穩定的省份再收穫不好，馬上就會影響到整個民生問題。</p>
<p>現在，福建廣東等地，正面臨着這恐慌的風暴來襲。尤其是粵東一帶，去年已遭過大旱災。舊一波未平，新一波又起，其情形比福建更慘重百倍。以平時沒有科學設備的農村，只有眼巴巴的盼望「老天」下雨。對這苦旱的發生，其結果可推想者有二：一爲縱使老天再半月不下雨，則下半年度的收穫便成問題；一爲從另一方面來說，倘使「老天」最近幾天中能够下雨，而下半年度的收穫不但延遲，并且因氣候關係，收成最多只有十之七八。於上下季青黃不接的時候，糧食必能引起極大的恐慌。對這二點，前者我們還在希望不成事實，而後者看這情形，似乎已經不可避免了。這是整個民生的問題，其影響可能波及其他省份，不單限於福建或廣東的。我們不可專待外國慈悲的帮助，而忽略本身當前的危機。在這世界普遍發生災情之年，倘使美國能再運機載米麥來救濟中國，那亦等於杯水車薪，無補於大局的。歷史的顯例，明朝末年延安一隅旱災飢荒，影響舉國不安，人民爲生活所迫，流爲盜寇，釀成李自成張獻忠之亂，竟促使明室傾覆。現在，閩粵的災荒雖不如當時那樣嚴重，但是我們却不能不加以注意的。</p>
<p>當然的，我們儘管往好處着想，希望旱災飢荒不會　成，但是，災荒不成固好，若災荒竟成怎樣辦？歷史上許多因災荒引起民生痛苦而變亂的事實，不也是在這樣的情形下由　入深而釀成的嗎？何况在今日的中國，人民經過八年浩絕空前的苦難，出盡他們的物力財力精神，到現在已疲憊不堪。倘使在這困苦中，再遭遇意外劇烈的打擊，政府如不予以妥當的處理和帮助，人民將走上那一條求生之路？那就不敢推測了！</p>
<p>對於這關係民生大局的問題，我認爲不是屬於單一方面的，亦不限於福建廣東二省或粵東一帶的。這必須從整個的根本去解決。以如何安定民生，如何消除民間疾苦，作爲問題解決的中心。在這年頭，我們寗願多一慮以「積穀防飢」，不可少一籌而「一　十寒」的。在這里，我要求當局者能够切實的予以注意！（卅五·四·廿三，於福建）</p>

        <h1>1946.05.21</h1>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Inspects Siping Street; Northern Expeditionary National Army Presses on Princess Ridge; Liu Handong Returns to Liaobei Provincial Capital to Preside Over Administration</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] The result of the decisive battle of Siping Street has already been revealed. The National Army completely occupied New Siping Street on the morning of the 19th and continued to advance in five directions. The next decisive battleground should be Princess Ridge, the only hilly area south of Changchun. If the National Army takes advantage of the victory and moves into that area, Changchun can be taken without a fight. It is generally speculated that the battle for Changchun may create greater hatred and trigger a more complicated situation, but on the other hand, it may also become the foundation for easier success in new negotiations.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] The new changes in the situation between Shenyang and Changchun have been widely felt here in recent days. Since General Bai Chongxi arrived in Shenyang, related parties have received telegrams from the front lines yesterday, stating that the Communist forces north of Siping Street, as seen from aerial reconnaissance, have indeed begun a general collapse. This is because the National Army advancing on both flanks has cut off the Communist forces' reinforcement and supply lines with a lightning-fast advance. However, for the sake of prudence, officials are unwilling to reveal such news too early. According to those familiar with the situation in Changchun, the strength of the Communist forces in Changchun is actually very weak. After the complete recovery of Siping Street, the only major strategic point on the road to Changchun is Princess Ridge. The prelude to the decisive battle between the Nationalists and Communists is about to unfold there. The 32-day battle for Siping Street was clearly not a main battle. The advance of the National Army on both flanks has already determined the fate of the Communist forces on the front lines of Siping Street. Previously, the National Army's single-line direct advance had the suspicion of underestimating the enemy. Now, the National Army has a correct estimate of the strength of the Communist forces. In addition, General Bai Chongxi's personal inspection of Shenyang and General Sun Liren's re-leading of the New First Army have boosted morale on the front lines. In contrast, even if the Communist forces can pour all their bets on the Princess Ridge line for a last-ditch resistance, it will not be easy to reverse their decline.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang dispatch of the 20th] Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, accompanied by Chief Du Yuming and Deputy Chief Liang Huasheng, left Shenyang by special train at noon on the 20th to go to the Siping Street defense area to inspect the takeover situation of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] Siping Street is the capital of Liaobei Province. It was captured by the Communist forces on March 17th. Provincial Chairman Liu Handong and all provincial committee members were captured. Chairman Liu later escaped and established an office in Shenyang. Now that Siping Street has been completely recovered and the Communist forces have collapsed, Chairman Liu left Shenyang this afternoon to preside over provincial affairs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Siping Street dispatch of the 20th] The Northern Expeditionary National Army pressed close to Princess Ridge in five directions in the afternoon of the 20th.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] After the recovery of Siping, it has lost its original appearance. The local population was originally 170,000. After the Communist forces occupied it, the people fled one after another. Now there are only 40,000 people left. The houses are even more dilapidated and most of them have been dismantled for fuel. The stored grain has been looted. There is now an unprecedented famine. Fortunately, the airport is still intact and can be used. After the National Army entered the city, citizens returned one after another, but there were no houses to live in. The miserable situation is heartbreaking.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] It is generally believed here that the National Army will reach Changchun within a week after occupying Siping Street. However, it is heard that the Communist forces have mobilized 130,000 troops to stop the advance of the National Army.</p>
<h3>National Army Confluence on the Beining Railway; All Occupied Stations Recovered</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] After the National Army recovered the front of the Beining Railway, Gaoling and Xiaosonglinggou, the troops marching south from Suizhong and north from Yuguan met at Xiaosonglinggou at 6 pm yesterday. All the stations occupied by the Communist forces in recent days have been completely recovered by this point. Unfortunately, the railway has been severely damaged and it will be difficult to resume traffic for a while.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] The Liaoyang-Gongyuan line (branch of the China Chang Railway) has been repaired to Anping. This section is 31 kilometers long, and the entire line is 69 kilometers long. It is expected to be fully repaired today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Redundant Military Officers Unemployed; Begging in Hankou</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou dispatch of the 20th] Since the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters stopped registration at the beginning of the month, a large number of unemployed military officers have drifted into Hankou, and their lives are extremely destitute. A few days ago, a Major Huang, with his appointment certificates as a company and platoon leader in the 53rd Army, etc., laid them out beside Zhongshan Road and begged from passersby. Those who saw him deeply regretted his situation and hoped that the authorities would properly arrange relief measures.</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department Debates Rehe Issue; Rumor of National Army Recovering Beipiao; Executive Group to Inspect Tianjin Periphery</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] The Rehe issue became the focus of debate at today's Executive Headquarters transportation meeting, but without any results. Zhang, from the government side, inquired why the Rehe Communist forces attacked Beipiao, destroying the railway traffic on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line, and requested that it be stopped immediately. The Communist representative claimed that the government army used the line to move troops, so the Communist forces destroyed it. Before the end of the Northeast war, the Communist forces' destructive actions could not be stopped either. After a long and heated debate between the two sides, the American representative Hill said that according to the agreement, the order to restore traffic in North China and Central China did not yet include Rehe, and this matter would be discussed further. In addition, Li Juikui, Deputy Director of the Communist Planning and Executive Office of the Military Mediation Department, flew to Chengde yesterday on the order of Ye Jianying to inspect.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] The Military Mediation Department has decided to dispatch an executive group to inspect the periphery of Pingjin, obviously to eliminate the military conflicts that are gradually expanding. The group members are being selected separately by the three parties. Once preparations are completed, they can depart. There are two important areas of military conflict on the periphery of Pingjin, one is Anci on the Yongding River and the other is Changping on the Weicheng line.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] It is rumored that Beipiao has been recaptured by the National Army, and the position of the National Army in Rehe has been improved. However, this news remains to be confirmed. Beipiao is located at the connection point between Shenyang, Jinzhou and Chengde, and has rich coal production. It is a strategic location.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping dispatch of the 20th] Official sources here have received reports that the eastern section of the PingSui Railway and the Gubeikou area have become tense due to the Communist forces increasing their troops, and a major war is imminent. Elsewhere, it is reported that more than 200 intelligence personnel from He Long's guerrilla team have arrived in Changping, attempting to infiltrate Beiping.</p>
<h3>Regiment Commander of the Wanzhou Youth Army Shot and Killed by Student En Route</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou dispatch of the 20th] Huang Gongji, the Major General Regiment Commander of the 611th Regiment of the 204th Division of the Youth Army, currently residing in Wanzhou, was shot and killed by Diao Jingyuan, a student of the division, on his way back to his defense area. The murderer also committed suicide after the incident.</p>
<h3>Improving County Administration Efficiency; Hubei Province Relays Order for Compliance</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou dispatch of the 20th] The Ministry of Interior, considering the heavy workload of county administration, recently telegraphed various provincial governments to relay orders to the counties to reduce various gatherings in order to avoid affecting administrative efficiency. The authorities of Hubei Province have relayed the order for compliance.</p>
<h3>Tong Zhengling and Jiang Bohua Confront Each Other in Court in Nanjing; Investigation of the Jiangtai Ferry Case Concluded</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] The Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense summoned Tong Zhi Ling and Jiang Bohua, Director of the Tianjin Office of the Quartermaster General Department who was detained, for confrontation at 9:00 a.m. this morning. Chen Bangji, the captain of the Jiangtai Ferry, was also summoned to court. Tong denied knowing Jiang, and even denied that the Jiangtai Ferry's 10-hour delayed departure had anything to do with her. The captain also stated that the Jiangtai Ferry's delayed departure was waiting for the tide and that there was no order to wait. Today was a preliminary hearing and the public was prohibited from attending. It is heard that after the conclusion of the investigation, a public trial is planned. Tong is scheduled to take the train tonight with her mother and two staff members from the Queen Company who accompanied her to Nanjing, and will still be available for questioning whenever she is summoned.</p>
<h3>Marshall Concerned About North China Situation; States Effort to Prevent Spread of Northeast War; Preparations for Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group Meeting Underway</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] The overall situation is already on the Jinpu and PingSui Railways. The alarms from Jinan, northern Jiangsu, and northern Hubei are even more serious. However, the preparatory work for the Comprehensive Group Meeting is still in constant effort by all parties. It is heard that Shao Lizi had an hour-long meeting with Chang Naide, a representative of the Youth Party, at 9:00 a.m. this morning. The newly appointed Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei also continued his eighth meeting with Special Envoy Marshall this afternoon, and the conversation lasted for more than two and a half hours. It is heard that Special Envoy Marshall, although feeling extremely depressed about the current serious situation in China, still asked about the current transportation situation in various parts of China with remarkable patience, and collected more credible information from all parties for reference. According to a certain foreigner who frequents No. 5 Ninghai Road, Special Envoy Marshall does not believe that the Nationalist and Communist armies ignore the suffering of more than 200 million people and immediately decide to fight. He also believes that Special Envoy Marshall's work to save humanity from disaster and strive for peace will never be threatened by the force of either party. Special Envoy Marshall is well aware that the chaotic situation in China cannot be delayed any longer, and there will be important indications within the next week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] Marshall Headquarters here issued a statement today, the full text of which is as follows: "General Marshall is holding talks with representatives of Chinese political parties and other parties every day on the restoration of peace in the Northeast. He is deeply concerned about the serious situation in North China and is now trying his best to prevent the Northeast war from spreading to North China. The propaganda campaigns currently being carried out by both sides will inevitably stir up emotions and are more likely to cause some hotheads to ignite a prairie fire. This reckless propaganda of hatred and suspicion aggravates the current serious situation and can lead the Chinese people to suffer unfortunate consequences. The work of the Executive Group is made more difficult by the strengthening of propaganda among officers and soldiers by both sides. The efforts of China to at least localize its conflicts, even if it does not completely stop them, depend largely on the success of these Executive Groups. The American representatives in each group are dealing with a situation that is not only difficult but also life-threatening with steadfast and impartial efforts to improve the status quo.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] The Beiping Military Mediation Department is outraged that the past situation of fighting and negotiating, fighting to a stalemate and then negotiating again, and negotiating to a stalemate and then fighting again has exhausted hundreds of Executive Group personnel, who have worked hard and achieved nothing. A detailed report has been sent to Nanjing, stating the difficulties and providing opinions on strengthening the powers of mediation and improving the methods of mediation. When Zheng Jiemin and Robertson came to Nanjing, they also reported their valuable experiences to the relevant authorities one after another, and broadly outlined the situation. It is heard that Marshall also reviewed this issue with Yu Dawei during their conversation today. According to news revealed by various parties tonight, if the situation is fortunately improved, Marshall, Yu Dawei, and Zhou Enlai may fly north immediately, and the overall situation has not yet reached a state of despair.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing dispatch of the 20th] Government Political Consultative Conference representatives Wang Shijie and Shao Lizi and Political Consultative Conference Secretary-General Lei Zhen visited Youth Party Political Consultative Conference representative Chang Naide and Central Standing Committee member Liu Dongyan at 10:00 a.m. on the 20th. Chang Naide, Liu Dongyan, and Liu Siying, Secretary-General of the Youth Party delegation, visited Dong Biwu at Meiyuan New Village at 1:00 p.m. Subsequently, Chang and Liu accepted Zhang Qun's invitation and went to Zhang's residence for talks. It is heard that they exchanged opinions extensively on the current situation in their mutual discussions.</p>
<h3>New and Old Mayors Hand Over This Morning; Mayor Wu Takes Office; Announces Policy Guidelines to Focus on the Big Picture; Zhu Ping and Gu Chunfan Scheduled to Take Office This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our report] The city's new Mayor Wu Guozhen attended the City Hall Memorial Week ceremony yesterday morning and officially took over the seal to begin his duties. Previously, former Mayor Qian sent Chief of General Affairs Shi Bangrui at 8:30 a.m. to welcome him at the Broadway Building. Wu arrived at 9:00 a.m. sharp in the same car with the new Secretary-General He Dekui and Director of Land Administration Zhu Ping. Accompanied by the military band, Police Chief Xuan Tiewu led them to the second floor, where former Secretary-General Shen welcomed them into the Mayor's Office. After Mayor Qian introduced each bureau chief and department head of the City Government to Mayor Wu one by one, they attended the Memorial Week ceremony together. He took over the seal at 9:45 a.m. and immediately announced his assumption of office. The new Director of Finance Gu Chunfan arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 10:00 a.m. yesterday and immediately went to the City Hall to pay his respects to Mayor Wu. Gu and the new Director of Land Administration Zhu Ping are scheduled to take office at 3:00 p.m. today.</p>
<h3>Former Mayor Qian's Speech; Welcomes New Mayor; Bids Farewell to Former Colleagues</h3>
<p>At 9:05 a.m., new Mayor Wu, accompanied by former Mayor Qian, attended the Memorial Week ceremony for the first time. After performing the ceremony as usual, former Mayor Qian first delivered a farewell speech, saying briefly: "Today, the new Mayor Wu Guozhen is attending the Memorial Week ceremony for the first time, and at the same time, he is taking over his duties in advance. In the position of former mayor, I congratulate Mayor Wu and bid farewell to everyone. In August last year, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I was ordered by Chairman Chiang to take office as Mayor of Shanghai. I am aware of my weak abilities. In the past, Shanghai was under the control of foreigners due to the concessions and was not bound by our national laws. The War of Resistance began early, and Shanghai fell early, suffering deeply from the enemy and puppets. When victory arrived, the citizens of the city, in the joy of the masses, eagerly hoped to reduce suffering and seek welfare. After I was ordered, I also had this desire, and although I have worked diligently with my colleagues to make the greatest efforts, I have not been able to achieve the goal due to my lack of virtue and talent. Therefore, I have repeatedly requested to resign from the central authorities, and I am fortunate to have been approved. I am aware that I have made no achievements in the past eight months, and I would like to express my sincere apologies to my colleagues and the citizens of the city. Mayor Wu is an old friend of mine for more than ten years. He has served as Mayor of Hankou and Chongqing, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. With Mayor Wu's talent, he will definitely be able to do the job well. I not only congratulate Mayor Wu, but also deeply congratulate the citizens for getting a good person. I have been in Shanghai for eight months and have received the assistance of all my colleagues. I have not made any mistakes. Today, I bid farewell and would like to thank everyone."</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Speech Expresses Three Thoughts and Two Beliefs; Willing to Work Hard and Absolutely Not Take Money</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu said in his speech: "On the occasion of taking office today, I should first express my gratitude to former Mayor Qian, because Mayor Qian presided over the municipal administration in Shanghai after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The past eight months have been the most difficult stage, and Shanghai's situation should be able to return to normal in the future. As for the policy guidelines, it is not convenient to talk about them now, nor can I talk about them. I would like to briefly describe a few thoughts: First, Shanghai is an important commercial center, which is related to international reputation and is the economic center of the country. Its overall state is sufficient to affect the whole country. It is essential to improve the administrative efficiency of municipal institutions. I remember that during my tenure as Mayor of Hankou, I came to Shanghai to inspect the various facilities of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Its management policy is another matter, but its work efficiency is commendable. Now that the Shanghai concessions have been recovered and the governance is completely unified, Shanghai, under the governance of the Chinese, cannot exceed the achievements of the Shanghai Municipal Council era for a while, but at least it must be the same as in the past. This is the goal that we should have and can be regarded as a hope."</p>
<p>"Second, in order to improve administrative efficiency, we must strive to stabilize the lives of civil servants. How to rationalize the work of civil servants should be based on choosing the right person for the job, and there should be no one without something to do, and the work should be evenly distributed. As for the treatment of civil servants, I believe that it should at least maintain the minimum living standard, and then they can work with peace of mind. I believe that civil servants should not want to enjoy and be comfortable, especially in Shanghai, where extravagance is prevalent. Civil servants should take the lead in advocating and establishing a clean and honest atmosphere and serve as a model for the citizens. Third, I feel timid to be ordered to come to Shanghai, which I have never felt before, because the environment in Shanghai is complex and I have no grasp of everything. However, I have two beliefs that I dare to tell my colleagues: first, I will never take a penny; second, I will definitely work hard. Apart from this, there is nothing to say. If my colleagues in the City Government have any insights, regardless of their position, I am willing to listen to their opinions and hope that they will say everything they know and contribute their wisdom."</p>
<p>Regarding administration, he advocated focusing on the big picture. For things that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, after detailed research and determination, if they are considered feasible, they should be implemented vigorously with the means of cutting through the Gordian knot, in order to stabilize social order, consolidate the economic foundation, and develop the construction of a new Shanghai. I am willing to work together with all my colleagues.</p>

<h3>Procuring Foreign Rice to Ease Shortages: The Grain Crisis Can Be Overcome; Xu Kan Reports at the Central Memorial Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Central Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM on the 20th. After Chairman Chiang led the ceremony, Minister of Food Xu Kan reported on grain administration. Xu first stated that the current grain problem is very difficult, but this is an inevitable phenomenon after the war. During the War of Resistance, our country fought for the longest time, the occupied areas were the largest, and last year, provinces such as Hunan, Guangdong, and Henan suffered from famine. Taiwan and the Northeast had no surplus grain to supply. At the same time, some areas were affected by blockade and transportation, which led to the fact that only one-third of the 7.4 million shi of grain planned to be purchased last year has been completed, failing to achieve the goal of fully preparing grain for the military and civilians. Xu then proposed solutions to the current grain problem: (1) In accordance with the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session, the method of collecting land tax in kind will continue to be restored, and the Executive Yuan has decided to implement it from July 1st. (2) The surplus grain collected will be transported to grain-deficient areas. It is planned to transfer 2 million shi of surplus grain from Sichuan over the years to the provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and 500,000 shi from the Jiangxi grain reserve to the Beijing-Shanghai area. Anhui purchased a total of 1.8 million shi of grain, which will also be appropriately allocated to grain-deficient areas. In addition, two batches of foreign rice recently purchased, totaling approximately 17,000 tons, and the grain transported by the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, will be shipped one after another, which will alleviate the famine. In short, although China's current grain shortage problem is extremely serious, the time will not be very long and the crisis can be overcome. Xu said that the recent surge in grain prices in Shanghai was clearly manipulated and disrupted by unscrupulous elements. Regarding the grain for public and educational personnel in Nanjing, Xu said that he would be responsible for ensuring that there would be no shortage. After the speech, the Memorial Week concluded at 9:50 AM.</p>
<h3>Minister Peng Holds Tea Party; First Reception for the Press</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei held his first tea party for the press at the International Club at 3:00 PM on the 20th. Approximately 100 domestic and foreign reporters attended. Peng delivered a brief speech, which was also translated into English, lasting 40 minutes. The original text of Minister Peng's speech is recorded as follows: In the past fifteen years, my work has mainly been in the economic field. Most of the time I served in the Ministry of Communications and the Wartime Production Board, so I failed to establish close contact with the press. I am afraid it will be difficult for me to follow in the footsteps of Minister Wu and achieve such good results. I only hope that my shortcomings can be compensated by your assistance. I hope you will continue to assist me as you assisted the previous Minister of Propaganda.</p>
<p>China is now entering a constitutional period. The stage of one-party rule is over. The government has expanded its base and invited non-party members to participate in the most important positions in the government. People's opinion organs have been established in various provinces and important cities. You have personally witnessed the municipal councils of Chongqing and Shanghai. The elections are completely free, and representatives of various political opinions have been elected. All of these show that the government has implemented many important steps to realize a truly democratic government without waiting for the formal enactment of the constitution. This process is continuing to progress. The government is looking forward to the Communist Party stopping their military offensive, fulfilling their promises, and assisting in the completion of China's unification.</p>
<p>You must want to ask my opinion on the current situation. I am very willing to explain frankly, although I am not prepared to give a lengthy speech at this kind of gathering today. According to my observation, the most important and urgent issue at present is the restoration of important transportation routes. Don't say that I can't stop talking about my old job. This is really the result of my in-depth study of China's economic situation in Shanghai over the past three months.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, I inspected factories almost every day. The workers there unanimously asked me when the Longhai Railway, the Jinpu Railway, and the Pinghan Railway would be open to traffic. They said that they lacked coal, cotton, and various important raw materials, and were threatened by factory shutdowns and unemployment. Those raw materials either cannot be transported, or the freight is extraordinarily expensive. All workers and industrialists recognize that this matter is the decisive factor in their survival. Whether factories can continue to work, whether laborers can continue to be employed, and whether production costs can be reduced, largely depends on the restoration of various transportation routes. On the other hand, farmers suffer even more. In some places, agricultural products simply cannot be transported out, and in many other places, millions of farmers are starving to death.</p>
<p>Therefore, in my humble opinion, to alleviate the current economic difficulties and to prevent possible future crises, everyone who has sympathy for the common people should do their best to solve this problem.</p>
<p>I am extremely happy today to be able to meet with you all. I hope to gather often in the future. I wish you all success.</p>

<h3>Chairman Concerned About Refugees in Various Regions; Orders Strengthening of Relief Measures; Receives Wang Maogong and Others at the National Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] After listening to the reports from the National Assembly representatives from Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, as well as representatives from the National Federation of Commerce and industry and other provinces such as Jiangsu and Shandong, regarding the various tragic situations of the people suffering from the destruction of roads by the Communist army, Chairman Chiang instructed Premier Song and the ministers of Finance, Education, Communications, and Social Affairs to strengthen relief measures for refugees. Emergency relief will be given to out-of-school youths who escaped from the Communist bandits. It is heard that there are many intellectuals with refined manners among the refugees eating at the porridge factory in Zhenjiang. When they hold the porridge bowl every day, they cannot help but burst into tears. The tragic situation is heartbreaking.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Chairman Chiang received Chairman Wang Maogong of Jiangsu Province and Zhang Lisheng, Li Zhongxiang, Shao Yulin, and He Yangling at the National Government this morning, and invited several government officials to lunch at the military academy residence at noon. It was originally scheduled for Chairman He Siyuan of Shandong to come to Beijing today, but there has been no news of his arrival by 10:00 PM tonight. Although the situation in Shandong is said to be serious, the government's confidence in ensuring the safety of Jinan is still very firm. It was reported here today that the National Army had strengthened the defense of Jinan by air transport. The reporter inquired about this to military personnel. According to the reply, the defense of Jinan has indeed been strengthened. Please tell the elders of Shandong living abroad not to worry.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Nine Days in Changchun (3)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>(The previous two sections of this article were published on pages 1 and 7 of this newspaper on the 18th and 19th. Please refer to them.)</p>
<p>Songs and Suffering</p>
<p>The Manchurian National Bank building was originally so deserted that even ghosts could not be found during our stay. On the morning of the 15th, the worker hurriedly knocked on the door and said, "The Communist army has reached the State Council." Gunfire sounded throughout the night, from far to near. We were originally afraid to sleep soundly, but after days of hard work, we finally fell into a deep sleep at dawn and could not hear anything. I hurriedly put on my clothes and packed my suitcase. From then on, we knew that our lives would become more and more tense with the start of this war, and our lives would no longer be our own.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhou (Director of the Changchun Branch of the Central News Agency) prepared the car and asked us to go to the Central Bank. We knew that the Central Bank building was strong and the power supply was convenient, but we suddenly thought that the Central Bank might be the last stronghold to be fought over in the war, and the artillery fire would definitely be concentrated on it. Everyone discussed and decided to go to the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Several American colleagues lived there, or there were more people, which could give more ideas; at the same time, it could avoid the concentration of artillery fire. Thoughts were fluctuating for a while, contradicting each other, and we really didn't know what to do. Zhu Zhou and I finally went to the Central Bank first. At this time, the gunfire was getting denser and denser!</p>
<p>The Central Bank was only 700 meters away from the Commissioner's Office. The national flag on the Central Bank building could be seen on the balcony. The two buildings were facing each other, but the streets were covered with barbed wire, and pedestrians could no longer pass through alone. Except for two or three military vehicles speeding out to reinforce, nothing else could be seen in Datong Square near the Central Bank. Mayor Zhao Junmai, who lived in the Commissioner's Office with the American and Chinese reporters, seemed to have foreseen the situation and asked Zhu Zhou and me to come back. At 3:00 PM, before I came back, I called to tell everyone that the West Airport had been lost and that the area near the railway station was under fierce fighting. At 4:00 PM, I also contacted the Air Force Headquarters by phone, hoping to talk to Commander Jin, but Commander Jin had secretly escaped back to Shenyang by plane. Then the five American reporters from the newspaper drove to the Air Force Headquarters. Cao Yinchang, who was acting as Commander Jin, was holding the microphone and asking about the situation at the airport. Everyone knew that the situation was not good. After asking for a long time, no one answered. Afterwards, we learned that at 5:00 PM, the security team guarding the airport scattered and fled. At about 6:00 PM, the airport was completely occupied by the Communist army.</p>
<p>Zhao Junmai returned from the city government in the evening. We knew that the situation was extremely tense. The Xing'an Bridge, which led from the city to the Xing'an Avenue by the West Airport, was originally guarded by the Police Headquarters, but now it has moved to the city area to establish a new position. Zhao Junmai was always an optimist. He still used his experience as the mayor of Hengyang to think that he could hold on for a period of time.</p>
<p>Except for Zibeckett of the United Press, the other American friends were all happy-go-lucky. They were living treasures who wouldn't cry until they saw the coffin. They were still singing loudly upstairs, their voices shaking the house. I suspect even the Central Bank could hear them. Shi Xun and Beckett opened the map of Changchun and were studying strategic strongholds. I specifically ran to the basement of the Central Bank to sleep. We knew that the fall of the Xing'an Bridge, coupled with the weakness of the Police Headquarters, the resistance to protect Changchun was getting smaller and smaller. It would be extremely difficult to hold on to the core position.</p>
<p>Night fell. The cold north wind blew and made a miserable howling sound. The dense gunfire, mixed with the constant artillery fire, from south to north, from east to west, undoubtedly, the Communist army was attacking Changchun from all directions.</p>
<p>We couldn't sleep. Sometimes we felt sad, sometimes we laughed bitterly to ourselves. Chinese and Chinese were fighting like this , making us nervous and about to have a mental breakdown.</p>
<p>The People Don't Want War</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th, the city phone lines were cut off for a while. Zhao Junmai called the switchboard to inquire and learned that the electricity was running out and could only last until 4:00 PM tomorrow at most. Zhao Junmai promised to send gasoline to the switchboard to generate electricity automatically.</p>
<p>Regarding the power generation situation, when we lived in the Manchurian National Bank building, Qian Yaozhang, a commissioner of the Economic Commission, assisted us in decoding telegrams, so we felt very convenient. Since the radio station moved into the Central Bank, since the 16th, except for military telegrams, any telegrams were refused to be received or sent. We came to Changchun, originally wanting to exchange our lives for the price of reporting. Hearing this news was simply like a blow to the head. Our heads were as heavy as lead.</p>
<p>When the American and Chinese reporters saw Chen Jiazhen, the commander of the city defense, in the morning, he promised that we could send telegrams from the military radio station. So the Chinese reporters decided to send English joint telegrams as well. The military was busy, and we were always worried that the telegrams would be interrupted.</p>
<p>In the two days of war, many ordinary people died. There were thick black flames everywhere, several stories high. The Communist army's 75mm caliber artillery bombardment was powerful enough. Beckett of the United Press, who had participated in the Spanish Civil War in Madrid, said, "Madrid didn't fight so fiercely. The Chinese Communist Party fought really well. They are bandits." I once counted that the densest gunfire was 180 rounds per minute.</p>
<p>Zhang Datong once slipped back to Jinzhou, but was scolded back to Changchun by his superiors. He was full of displeasure. In fact, if we were him, we would also be dissatisfied. Zhang Jia'ao sent a telegram to Zhang Datong from Chongqing before the 14th, saying, "The government has specific solutions to the Northeast problem. The situation in Changchun is at most like Harbin." At the time, we couldn't guess what aspect of the phenomenon in Harbin he was referring to. Thinking of Zhang Jia'ao's telegram now, we can only laugh bitterly. In a crisis, Zhang Jia'ao gave Zhang Datong another telegram: "Asking Datong, Zhao Junmai, and Liu Zhe to negotiate with the Communist army to stop the war." Zhao Junmai personally told us this. He said, "Director Xiong wants Commander Chen to hold Changchun, and Director Zhang wants us to come out to negotiate." In the eyes of us reporters, this was simply news that was difficult to report.</p>
<p>Seeing the dead ordinary people, Zhao Junmai was quite willing to come out to mediate. He wanted us reporters to say a word as well. We immediately rejected his suggestion, because the Chinese reporter's pen could not stop the war, how much effect would the mouth have? As reporters, the Americans could not interfere in this difficult problem. At this time, representatives of eight people's organizations were trying to stop the war. They found Mayor Zhao and discussed it. They said that when they talked to Liu Zhe, the old gentleman cried. So everyone wrote the following letter to the Communist army on behalf of these eight organizations:</p>
<p>"To whom it may concern, Changchun has fallen into the fire. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties. The loss of people's lives and property is difficult to estimate. In order to prevent the people from being innocently sacrificed again, please send representatives to the Chinese and foreign reporter group to talk. The safety of life is guaranteed by Zhao Junmai, Mayor of Changchun, and Liu Zhe, Chairman of the China Changchun Railway Council. Respectfully, Your Commander" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>China's Friendship with the United States; So Also with the Soviet Union; Sun Ke Talks About Improving Sino-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke met with a United Press reporter alone at his residence today, saying: "China and the United States must live in peace, like good neighbors. The Soviet Union's attitude in the Northeast may be due to the fear that China and the United States will strengthen their ties. At present, there seem to be misunderstandings and suspicions between China and the Soviet Union. Perhaps the Soviet Union believes that China relies too much on the United States. In the event of a conflict between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, China will join the US camp. In fact, China not only wants to get along with the United States, but also with the Soviet Union. Therefore, we must improve our relations with the Soviet Union. In order to improve relations with all countries, China must not only become strong, but also have an independent foreign policy, so as not to rely solely on any one side. If we rely on one side, it will be detrimental to the world. All major issues in China, such as passing the constitution and organizing a coalition government, must be resolved after the Northeast dispute is stopped. If the Northeast dispute is resolved peacefully, then all other issues can be easily resolved. The overall situation in the Northeast is now being resolved in the military three-person group. The recent personnel changes in the Executive Yuan, bringing in two non-party members, do not mean that the government ignores the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. These changes are temporary. When a government of all parties is finally organized, there will be more important changes. The current problem is how to coordinate, on the one hand, the extreme conservatives, and on the other hand, the extreme radicals. We must seek balance. Once the Kuomintang and the Communist Party trust each other, the late Father of the Nation's teachings will not be difficult to realize."</p>
<h3>Long Yun and Others Head East from Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] President of the Military Advisory Council Long Yun, Vice President Yu Xuezhong, and Northeast elder Mo Dehui are scheduled to leave Chongqing for Beijing on the Minben Ship at 3:00 PM on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Area Decides to Clear the Countryside; Military and Political Sides Will Proceed Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 20th] The Jiangnan area has decided to start clearing the countryside, with the aim of eliminating the activities of bandits who disrupt the local area, so as to achieve a state of returning to governance. The steps planned to be implemented in Suzhou are as follows: (1) Politically, the county government, together with local organs and legal entities, will organize a comfort mission to first depart to unstable jurisdictions and begin comfort work, in order to deepen the government's good intentions in the folk. (2) Militarily, the garrison 145th Division will cooperate with local teams to depart to unstable areas to encircle and suppress them. (3) In terms of aftermath, use the Baojia system in the cleared areas to issue a guarantee that it has been cleared, that is, joint Baojia and joint responsibility. If bandit traces are found again in the future, only the Baojia head will be questioned.</p>
<p>On-the-Spot Investigation of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line; Industrial and Commercial Costs Are High, Sales Are Sluggish</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] The reporter of this newspaper departed on the 15th of this month to investigate various places along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and returned to Hangzhou on the 20th. It took five days. The area between Shanghai and Hangzhou is originally a rich cultural and wealthy area and a silk producing area. During the war, it was exploited by the enemy and puppet regimes, and the people suffered. After the victory, the industrial circles suffered from high costs and sluggish sales, while foreign goods were cheap and beautiful, so many have a "get by" attitude. Business circles suffered from large expenses and sluggish business. They originally hoped that when the silkworm season opened, farmers would sell cocoons for profit, and business would improve. However, the cost of silkworm breeding this year was particularly high, and the silk mills did not collect cocoons at the government-stipulated price of 100,000 yuan per load, and even as low as 60,000 yuan. Local cocoons were as low as 40,000 yuan, and no one even asked about them, while mulberry leaves were as high as 20,000 yuan per load. The profit earned was not enough to repay the capital, let alone have surplus funds to purchase goods. In addition, there was excessive rainfall this spring, and the wheat harvest was not seen to be abundant, so the farmers were discouraged. Robberies by bandits are frequently heard in various counties. Waterways and highways are not safe. Looting of towns and villages has become common. As a result, rumors are rampant, and the people are panicked. Elections for county councilors in various counties have generally been completed, but the people are indifferent. A few people have accused them of cheating and have not stopped until now. Local fair-minded people told reporters that if this continues, the paradise of Jiangnan will probably become hell.</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence</h3>
<p>Fengxian: County Government Strictly Prohibits Opium and Drugs</p>
<p>On the 17th, the county government convened representatives from various legal entities to hold a meeting on strictly prohibiting opium and drugs. An emergency measure for banning opium and drugs was passed on the spot, promulgated, and implemented. All opium and drugs in the county must be eradicated by the end of this month. Opium addicts are forced to register for detoxification. Simultaneously, military police are mobilized to strictly inspect stations and ports to apprehend traffickers. Local newspapers are also tasked with compiling and printing special publications for publicity. Repeat offenders will be severely punished according to the regulations for punishing opium and drug-related crimes.</p>
<p>Huzhou: Robberies on Land and Water Frequent in Wuxing</p>
<p>The "Shuangjia" steamboat, belonging to Shuanglin Town in the county, was sailing from Shuangkaihe on May 16th when it was intercepted and robbed by six bandits near the Hongcheng Bridge, resulting in losses of one million yuan. Furthermore, on the Huzhou-Changxing Highway, on May 17th at 8:00 AM, a bus traveling from Huzhou to Changxing was passing through San Tian Men (i.e., Qing Cao Wu) when it suddenly encountered over a hundred bandits, all wearing armbands and carrying two light machine guns and multiple rifles. They ordered the bus to stop and looted at will, killing two passengers, resulting in losses of over ten million yuan. A bus traveling from Changxing to Huzhou also suffered robbery at the same location. Upon receiving reports, the Changxing Command Post and the Wuxing City Defense Headquarters dispatched large contingents to encircle and suppress the bandits, in order to safeguard local peace.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Increased Coal Allocation Price Causes Power Plant Deficits</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Power Plant's monthly coal requirements are supplied by the Shanghai Area Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Although the quantity is limited, the price is uniform. However, since April, the coal allocation price has suddenly been divided into two types: for electricity used for lighting, limited to 1,500 tons, the price per ton has increased from 38,000 yuan (including transportation and consumption) to 54,000 yuan; for electricity used for motors, an additional 1,000 tons are allocated, with a price of 170,000 yuan per ton. While the increase for lighting is limited, the increase for motors is fourfold. To consider the burden on industrial and commercial users, the plant requested the provincial and municipal authorities to ask the Ministry of Economic Affairs to cancel this measure, but without result. The plant has suffered losses of over 200 million yuan in the past six months due to the difficulty in cracking down on electricity theft. Based on current costs, it will suffer monthly losses of 50 million yuan, so it plans to moderately increase prices to reduce deficits.</p>
<p>Suzhou: County Government Meeting Passes Important Cases</p>
<p>The county government convened its 15th county government meeting on the 18th and passed important cases as follows: (1) The budget for the district, township, and town self-defense forces was sent to the Provisional Council for review. (2) The Provincial Order rejecting the committee's purchase of military grain was rejected. It is proposed to be drawn from local contingency funds. (3) The number of summer uniforms for the county police chief and police bureau is insufficient, and permission is granted to add them, with funds drawn from the clothing expenses. (4) One million yuan in county epidemic prevention expenses will be temporarily drawn from the health care expenses.</p>
<p>Changshu: Second Term of Cadre Trainees Continues Training</p>
<p>The first term of trainees at the local administrative cadre training institute in this county has already graduated. Regarding the objects of the second term of training, the sixth district chief meeting has decided that they will be the Baozhang who did not report in the first term and the township and town government cadres. They are required to report before the 20th to await training.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Telegram to the Province Urges Practical Suppression and Stabilization of Rice Prices</p>
<p>Various public organizations in the county, such as the County Provisional Council and the Journalists' Association, telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Grain Management Office due to the repeated and unreasonable soaring rice prices. The price in Wuxi City has exceeded 60,000 yuan, and it is clear that merchants are manipulating and hoarding. This concerns the people's food supply, and if strict measures are not taken, the common people will not be able to live. Commodity prices will fluctuate accordingly, with extremely serious consequences. On the 19th, they especially telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Grain Management Office, urging them to order the Wuxi County Government to, in conjunction with the military police, strictly investigate warehouses and earnestly implement price controls. Those who illegally raise prices will be confiscated.</p>
<p>Jintan: Petition for Exemption from Recovery of Various Taxes</p>
<p>After the victory, this county was occupied by bandits for several months, and the recovery was delayed. The people suffered greatly, resulting in rural bankruptcy and the decline of all industries. Now that the Jintan Collection Office for Direct Taxes has been established, it is still forcing the recovery of various taxes on business income during the occupation period, which merchants and residents cannot afford. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting of various industries. In addition to jointly submitting a request to the Ministry of Finance for exemption from various taxes during the occupation period, they also sent representatives Lu Hainian, Xu Fushou, etc., to Nanjing to appeal for relief to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<p>Wuhu: Municipal Preparatory Office to Close Immediately</p>
<p>Zhang Weixia, director of the Wuhu Municipal Preparatory Office, submitted a request to the provincial government to continue the establishment because the preparatory work had not yet been completed. The standing committee resolved yesterday to close it by the end of June and reorganize it into the Wuhu Municipal Planning Committee in accordance with the urban planning regulations issued by the Ministry of Interior. An order will be issued to notify them in the coming days.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Self-Awareness of Shanghai People</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the new mayor of Shanghai took office. We would like to take advantage of the reorganization of the municipal government to express our views on the status of Shanghai in order to promote the self-awareness of the citizens and the municipal authorities.</p>
<p>Looking at Shanghai from within Shanghai sometimes makes it difficult to see the whole picture of Shanghai. Only by looking at Shanghai from the perspective of the whole country can we easily see the entire status and mission of Shanghai. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. All economic phenomena in Shanghai, whether good or bad, quickly spread throughout the country. If Shanghai people only talk about consumption, the whole country will only know consumption. If Shanghai people work hard to produce, the whole country will also work hard to produce. Whether it is the price of gold and rice or the situation of all markets, Shanghai has a kind of unwritten leading role for the whole country. The financial and economic circles of all inland cities look to Shanghai as their leader. Shanghai, which is the leader, needs to have a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Looking at Shanghai from within Shanghai, surrounded by an emotional atmosphere, what is seen is a dream of prosperity, a treasure trove of gold, a place where beauty and ugliness coexist, and a place where good and evil exchange. There is intoxication and panic, pursuit and curse. The dazzling colors make it difficult for people to see the true face of Shanghai. Looking at Shanghai from the grand perspective of revolution and national construction, we dare to put forward a new understanding: China's initial revolution went from south to north, the War of Resistance went from west to east, and the future national construction will go from east to west. The so-called going from east to west does not mean emphasizing the east and neglecting the west, nor does it mean that the east should be built well before going to build the west; rather, it means that all construction capital and technology must be imported to the west through the eastern hub. Shanghai stands at the eastern tip of China, absorbing the air and civilization of the ocean to instill it into the whole country, which has a history of more than a hundred years. If Nanjing is the head of China, then Shanghai is the "lung of China." When Shanghai was attacked on January 28th and August 13th, the whole of China felt the pain of suffocation. The resources hidden inside China are indeed extremely rich, but if there is no "lung of China" to absorb oxygen to digest and smelt them, these rich resources will be like food that stays in the stomach without being digested, leading to sluggish and decadent pathologies. During the War of Resistance, China's internal development and construction remained sluggish and could not proceed smoothly because the coast was blocked by the enemy, which is clear evidence.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai is the "lung of China," Shanghai's clarity is enough to promote China's health; Shanghai's pollution is enough to prolong China's fatigue. We should have self-awareness and vigilance about this.</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said: "The most important thing in construction is the people's livelihood." The construction of the people's livelihood is economic construction. Since Shanghai is the economic center, it is also the center of the country's most important people's livelihood construction in the future. In the past, Shanghai, due to unequal treaties and the existence of concessions, became a special area outside of China. In that period, China could be poor and Shanghai could be rich alone, China could be in chaos and Shanghai could be safe alone. Now this situation has changed. In the future, China cannot be in chaos and Shanghai cannot be safe alone, China cannot be poor and Shanghai cannot be rich alone. Shanghai is the Shanghai of China. Shanghai has an important position in China and a special responsibility. Shanghai is China's most important "city of people's livelihood and economy" for construction.</p>
<p>All old ideas about Shanghai need to be changed, and new understandings need to be established. "Recovery is not restoration." This meaning is particularly applicable in Shanghai. Although Shanghai is an old city that has been developed for more than a hundred years, its life is new. This life began with the signing of the new Sino-American and Sino-British equal treaties in January of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, which rejuvenated this old city of a hundred years. Shanghai is now only a three-year-old infant, and the infant's first one or two years were spent under the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders, unable to recognize and enjoy the reality of the new life. The reality of the new life began after the victory of the War of Resistance and the period of acceptance. Especially after the return of the National Government to its capital, Shanghai is a large city close to the capital, and its mission to assist the central government in developing national construction is even more clear.</p>
<p>Do not regard Shanghai as a place of enjoyment, a place of recreation, a place of escape, or a garbage can for hiding dirt and accepting filth. Washing away the dirt of the old dye and stimulating the new vitality is an important period now.</p>
<p>In order to inspire vitality and invigorate new life, let us put aside all the phenomena of Shanghai's extravagance, the divergent and chaotic deformity, and calm down to describe a few bright and splendid historical events:</p>
<p>First, what is worth praising about Shanghai is that the blueprint for China's national construction, The National Construction Strategy, was completed in Shanghai. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen led the navy south to protect the law, but was later blocked by the Gui clique warlords. Dr. Sun then led his comrades from Guangzhou to Shanghai to found the Construction Magazine to establish the foundation of the theory of national construction and successively wrote the three books of Sun Wen's Doctrine, The Industrial Plan, and The Elementary Principles of Democracy, which together constitute The National Construction Strategy. Now, after the victory of the War of Resistance, it is time for us to put The National Construction Strategy into practice. The National Construction Strategy was written by Dr. Sun Yat-sen when he lived in Shanghai during the period of warlord rule and when the future was dark. The National Construction Strategy written in Shanghai should still be completed with Shanghai as the starting point. We should seek to realize the plan of Greater Shanghai day and night.</p>
<p>Second, what is worth praising about Shanghai is that Shanghai is the base for the practical revolutionary movement of the current Chairman of the National Government, Chiang Kai-shek. In the year before the founding of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek was still studying in Japan. He asked for leave to return to China in the summer and secretly discussed with Mr. Chen Qimei to launch a revolution in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area. He personally trained a regiment in Shanghai and served as its commander. In the second year of the Republic of China, he participated in the Second Revolution against Yuan Shikai in Shanghai. Especially in the fourth year of the Republic of China, after Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, Mr. Chen Qimei took the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army Against Yuan in Shanghai and appointed Mr. Chiang as Chief of Staff. On December 5, he launched the independent Zhaohe warship. This famous Zhaohe Uprising was the prelude to the Yunnan Uprising that destroyed Yuan Shikai's imperial system and restored the Republic of China. Is Shanghai just a place for enjoyment and recreation? History's answer is "no." In the process of revolution and national construction, Shanghai has its brilliant symbols, which are worth remembering and promoting.</p>
<p>Now, not only is post-war economic construction waiting to be launched, but the post-war economic crisis is also in urgent need of reversal. The world regards Shanghai as the starting point for China's economic reconstruction and the turning point for China's economic security. After a long period of War of Resistance, China's economy is not only weak and dilapidated, but also has undergone serious abnormalities and is about to enter a long and divergent path. How to reverse the mechanism, turn danger into safety, transcend the divergent path, and return to the right track naturally depends on the guidance of the country's entire economic policy, and the importance of its implementation cannot but begin in Shanghai. Moreover, the facts tell us that the formulation and implementation of a national economic policy requires the support and cooperation of the entire society before and after the event. If the people of Shanghai are not self-aware, China's overall economy will inevitably suffer from it. We look at Shanghai from multiple angles and feel the importance of Shanghai's position and mission. If the people of Shanghai can be self-aware, they will surely create a bright and unlimited future for themselves and the country.</p>

<h3>Forty-Four Nations Participating, Civil Aviation Conference Opens Today, To Establish a Plan for Peace and Prosperity in the Skies, Whether the Soviet Union Will Participate Remains a Question</h3>
<p>[United Press, Montreal, Canada, 20th Dispatch] Representatives from various countries around the world will hold a meeting tomorrow to establish a plan for peace and prosperity in the skies. A similar conference was held in Chicago eighteen months ago with the same purpose. At that time, the world's wars had not ended, and making plans for peacetime aviation seemed premature. Forty-four countries are participating in the Montreal conference and have expressed their cooperation by joining the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization proposed by the Chicago conference. One thing is the same as the Chicago conference: whether the Soviet Union will participate remains a question. The Soviet Union has been invited to participate in all international aviation activities, but the country's attitude remains unpredictable. The International Civil Aviation Organization Committee is still reserving a seat for the Soviet Union. This will cause discussion, as some countries have questioned why this seat must be vacant. Argentina's membership is also a new event. The country was not invited to participate in the Chicago conference. Non-member countries, excluding former Axis enemies, have been invited to attend as observers. The conference will last from two to five weeks.</p>

<h3>Monk Beats Drum and Pays Homage from Afar, Widow Wants Compensation for Husband, Interesting Anecdotes of Japanese Starving People Rioting at the Imperial Palace</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 20th Dispatch] Two hundred thousand starving Japanese people held a demonstration outside the palace yesterday. The following are supplementary interesting anecdotes:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the demonstration, Communist leader Tokuda gave a speech outside the palace gate, pointing to the Imperial Palace and saying, "We are starving to death, but look at the Emperor, he is satisfied in everything. We want him to give us food to eat." The crowd responded with cheers. At that time, the sound of drums gradually came from afar, becoming louder and louder, attracting the attention of the crowd. Finally, five monks in yellow robes were discovered, drumming in their hands, arriving at the palace gate. These people leisurely prostrated themselves and paid homage to the Japanese Emperor from afar. For a time, the crowd watched, no longer listening to the speech. Several leaders of the demonstrators, seeing this situation, were furious, their faces flushed, and shouted, "They must be crazy. They must have been bribed by Yoshida." After a while, order was restored, and Tokuda continued to speak, saying, "We must work for the revival of Japan, but how can we work on an empty stomach?" At this time, the crowd's attention shifted to a young farmer's wife, wearing a kimono, holding a small urn containing the ashes of her deceased husband. The woman pointed to the Emperor from afar and said, "My husband died in battle, you are responsible. Can you give him back to me?" At this point, the leaders of the demonstrators felt that the time had come, and decided to advance towards the palace gate, but were blocked by American tanks and Japanese police in front of the palace gate.</p>

The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference began on April 23 and was adjourned for two weeks. During this period, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt visited Paris, and South African Prime Minister Smuts also went to Germany. After the two returned, they felt more strongly that the interests of small countries should be emphasized when discussing peace and German issues. In the first half of the Commonwealth Conference, Palestine, Egypt, Pacific bases, Italian territories, the future status of Germany, and the defense of the British Republic were discussed.

<h3>Using Food as a Weapon to Prevent Communist Domination, Hoover's Plan from 25 Years Ago Is Revealed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th United Press Dispatch] Secret documents related to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, released by the U.S. State Department, reveal how former U.S. President Hoover and the Allies tried to use food as a political weapon to prevent the spread of communism. This is found in the seventh volume of documents released by the State Department. In 1919, the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and Japan all participated in this policy. At that time, politicians of the Allied countries were deeply afraid of the spread of communism. Therefore, Hoover suggested that the people of Hungary, who were under strict blockade at the time, could receive food aid if they could overthrow their communist government. Hoover said at a meeting, "The trade union system is used as a tool to overthrow Bolshevism."</p>

The Pennsylvania and Central stations were filled with anxious and tired passengers, which gradually decreased after the trains resumed normal operation.

<h3>British Tram Strike Resolved, Resumes Service Today, Customs Go-Slow Has a Significant Impact on Shipping, Scavengers' Petition Still Has No Results</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] The British tram workers' strike issue has been resolved through consultations with the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau and will resume traffic starting today.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the labor disputes of the Jianghai Customs, scavengers, and tailoring industries were still at a standstill. However, it is rumored that the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee believes that public utilities cannot strike, and the government has clear orders in place. Therefore, if necessary, compulsory resumption of work will be enforced. The Jianghai Customs authorities have also instructed employee representatives not to take any interference actions against employees who resume work, and will maintain order by force. Therefore, the trend of labor disputes today may change. The following is a summary of the information obtained by this newspaper's reporters from various parties concerned about the labor disputes yesterday:</p>
<p>Tram Company</p>
<p>Representatives from the British Tram Company employees went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to discuss the matter. According to their person in charge, negotiations have not yet begun. The purpose of this visit was to explain the truth and reasons of this incident to the authorities, and to state that they were not asking for an increase in basic salary, but were asking that the 3,400 employees should receive the same treatment as the 100 office staff, why the company uniquely increased the basic salary of these few employees by one to ten yuan each. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that it would investigate who should be responsible for this incident before proceeding with mediation. According to the employee representative, their actions were unanimous, and there were no factions as rumored.</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs go-slow incident did not improve yesterday. The employees also posted notices at the gate of Jianghai Customs, describing the go-slow process. According to the person in charge of Jianghai Customs, the authorities have always been concerned about the treatment of customs employees and have therefore frequently adjusted it. Two months ago, the Inspector General of Customs requested the government to change the treatment of customs employees to be calculated based on the cost of living index, but it was not approved, but it has been implemented in accordance with other state-owned business institutions such as the China Textile Company and the Four Banks. The General Administration believes that the request to issue a month's salary as a relief fund cannot be done and is not a fundamental solution. Yesterday morning, Deputy Inspector General Ding Guitang specially convened a meeting of all employee representatives to inform them of (1) the fundamental solutions being discussed with the Commissioner of Customs and the Inspector General of Customs, and (2) the decision to first issue a month's salary, but the only condition is that the employees must resume work. At about 3 pm, Ding convened another meeting to persuade them to resume work immediately, and not to take any intervention actions against employees who are willing to resume work, otherwise, he would have to resort to force to maintain order. It is heard that the representatives have agreed to abide by the non-interference point. Next, he persuaded the employees to take into account the convenience of customs clearance for import and export ships.</p>
<p>It is heard that this go-slow by customs employees has had a significant impact on shipping. Ships that should be opened cannot be cleared, suspending exports. Imported ships cannot declare and pick up goods due to the inability to clear customs, causing delays in ship schedules. Various companies have now obtained the permission of the Commissioner of Customs to export without clearing customs, but the destination cannot be changed. The Hanyang Wheel exported and sailed to Hong Kong this morning, and the Sanbei Company's Yongjia Wheel is also scheduled to sail to Wuhan this morning. Ships preparing to export are also required to load goods first and then declare them. It is heard that the Gentelfish and Manhershtair vessels, represented by the American President Lines, have temporarily suspended exports and returned to the United States due to the impact of the customs go-slow.</p>
<p>Scavengers</p>
<p>The strike of scavengers throughout the city continued yesterday. Garbage accumulated more and more on the streets, and debris and waste paper flew all over the streets. Thousands of scavengers carrying brooms and iron shovels and wearing red vests rushed to the Social Affairs Bureau from various districts to petition from 8 am. They held red and green paper flags and used the Kuomintang flag as a guide. The Social Affairs Bureau felt quite tricky in mediating this matter. Although Director Wu, Director Zhao, and Lu Keming of the Labor Association made various efforts and promised to increase the existing monthly salary of 52,000 yuan to 60,000 yuan, and borrow an additional 30,000 yuan in relief funds per person, the workers did not accept it. They gradually dispersed at 5 pm and will petition and mediate again today.</p>
<p>Wuyi Fellow Villagers Call for Protection of Human Rights</p>
<p>Xu Ziping, a vendor, was extorted and beaten by the police near the Great Light Cinema at noon on the 11th of this month, and sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, his life in danger. His brother Xu Zhizhong hired lawyer Xu Ying to sue the local court and requested the Xincheng Police Station to hand over the assailant police officer within a time limit for legal punishment. Now that more than ten days have passed, the perpetrator has not been apprehended. Xu Qiu, etc., representatives of the Yangzhong, Zhenjiang, Jinshan, Danyang, and Qingyang Wuyi native place associations in Shanghai, specially hosted various circles at the Jingu Hotel yesterday, where the representatives of the native place associations reported the truth of the incident, and called on all circles to uphold justice for the sake of protecting human rights and the safety of more than 4 million citizens, thoroughly investigating the perpetrator, and preventing similar incidents from happening again.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] It is learned that the assailant police chief Song Xilin (Hebei native), No. 507, surrendered to the Xincheng Branch yesterday and denied the assault. After preliminary interrogation by Director Zhuo, he was ordered to be detained and sent to the local prosecutor's office in the near future.</p>
<h3>Two U.S. Warships Arrive at Port, Responsible for Garrisoning Shanghai and Tianjin</h3>
<p>A heavy cruiser and a flagship under the command of U.S. Rear Admiral Keith arrived here from the U.S. yesterday afternoon and berthed at Wusongkou. The two ships will be stationed in Tianjin and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>China United New Ship, Maiden Voyage to Tianjin</h3>
<p>The China United Company at 549 Sichuan Road previously ordered several new type merchant ships in the United States. It is now heard that four of them have arrived outside Wusongkou. The first China United ship sailed into the Huangpu River yesterday. The ship has a deadweight of 2,500 tons and is scheduled to clear customs on the 25th and set sail for Tianjin for its maiden voyage.</p>
<h3>A Silver Key at 6 O'Clock, Respectfully Presented to Mayor Qian as a Souvenir</h3>
<p>The City Provisional Council, in order to express their sentiment toward Mayor Qian's departure, the Resident Committee last week specially resolved to grant him the honor of a free citizen of Shanghai and cast a silver key as a gift. It was originally scheduled to hold the presentation ceremony at the International Hotel at noon yesterday. Qian declined repeatedly because he did not want to disturb the public. Therefore, at 12 noon yesterday, Council Speaker Xu Jiyin and Deputy Speaker Xi Yushu went to Qian's residence on Jessfield Road as representatives to present the silver key. Qian personally accepted the gift. The ceremony was extremely simple. The silver key is six inches long, with the words "Free Citizen of Shanghai" engraved on it, with the inscription "In Memory of Mr. Muyin, Presented by the Shanghai Provisional Council, May 2, 35th Year of the Republic of China."</p>

<h3>Traitor Qiao Poke, of French Nationality, on Trial: Destroyed Our Underground Radio Stations; Wu Qingyun Charged with Funding the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court heard two cases of treason, detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Qiao Poke, a French national, came to Shanghai in 1940 and worked for the former French Concession police. During the war, he reported numerous cases of concealed United Nations property to the Japanese, resulting in their confiscation. He also dismantled several foreign currency exchange operations and colluded with French expatriate A Laixi to use a vehicle equipped with wireless radio detectors to destroy several of our underground radio stations. Furthermore, he secretly reported the names of Allied spies to the enemy, hindering underground operations. He was arrested and prosecuted by our military authorities after the victory.</p>
<p>The defendant attempted to evade responsibility, but the testimonies of witnesses A Laixi, Tang Shiqi, Deli Ai, and Bao Du'ang were still unfavorable to him. After a thorough questioning by the presiding judge, the trial was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<p>Next, Wu Qingyun was tried. Wu was an employee of the Nanjing puppet government's Anti-Smoking Bureau stationed in Nanxun. Within a month of his employment, he committed the crime of providing financial support to the enemy. The defendant admitted to holding a position in the puppet government but denied all charges, claiming that he was forced to take the position due to financial hardship. The court adjourned the trial for further hearing, and the defendant was remanded to custody.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Zhang Xiaoda, a secret agent of the enemy constabulary, was tried for arresting our underground workers and harming innocent civilians during the enemy occupation. The case has been concluded and will be sentenced on the 27th.</p>
<p>It is said that Madame Chiang Kai-shek praised her highly. Indeed, in her demeanor and conversation, I found some similarities to Madame Chiang.</p>
<h3>An Impression of the Mayor's Wife</h3>
<p>— By our reporter, Mai Tian</p>
<p>When mentioning the name of Madame Huang Zhuoqun, wife of Wu Guozhen, I believe everyone who has spent some time in Hankou or Chongqing, or who is familiar with the anecdotes of diplomats, knows her. The deepest impressions that Madame Wu gives people are her "demeanor" and "talent." However, there may still be many people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time and do not know her, so they are even more eager to meet Shanghai's first lady. Here, I can introduce to everyone that Madame Wu is an ideal diplomat or mayor's wife, and a model of a virtuous wife and good mother. She does not have the airs of an average official's wife. Even more exemplary for modern families, the mayor's family is a very harmonious and happy one, which has a great influence on the personality, future, and career of every member of the family.</p>
<p>Worried About the Mayor's Health</p>
<p>"I am worried about the mayor's health. Since he took office in various places, he has never had a good rest. After finishing his official duties, he reads the newspapers until late every night." Speaking in fluent Shanghainese, Madame Wu mentioned that when the mayor was in Chongqing, he personally risked going out to inspect the city every time enemy planes bombed Chongqing. Once, he was unfortunately injured in the eye, and it did not recover until five years later, but he still felt uncomfortable after overwork.</p>
<p>Madame Wu also said: "But I am even more worried that the mayor has come to Shanghai this time. The situation in such an important city is very complicated. I am afraid that he will not be able to handle it, which will disappoint the citizens of Shanghai."</p>
<p>Madame Wu is very kind and enthusiastic, which is fully demonstrated by the conversations with the mayor's subordinates. She is very polite to all her colleagues, both superiors and subordinates. She does not want to publish too much about her personal affairs, but she is willing to have reporters promote thrift on her behalf. She said, "Everyone likes to be comfortable. Of course, when the country is stable, people in better circumstances can live more prosperously than others, but at present, I don’t know how many men, women, old, and young compatriots are displaced, eating tree bark, and without clothes to cover their bodies. The suffering is unbearable. When we think of their pain, we should save a little ourselves."</p>
<p>Concerned About the Education of Refugee Children</p>
<p>The Mayor's wife is particularly concerned about the education of refugee children. She has run a civilian school for six or seven years and worked for the Children's Welfare Association in Chongqing. Unfortunately, Madame Wu's health is very weak, and she was advised by doctors to rest for a year, but she refused to give up her social work. She lamented and said, "There are so many children in Shanghai, there are so many things we need to do!" However, she believes that although a career is very important for women, the responsibility of housewives should not be ignored either. She regards the efforts of women in Chongqing to serve the country during the war as an unparalleled glory. "I have no ability myself," she said modestly, "I hope everyone can come to advise me and criticize me at any time, I will definitely be willing to accept it, and I hope you often come to talk like friends."</p>
<p>Madame Wu's education of her children is completely modern. Her two daughters, Wu Xiurong, who is fourteen years old, and Wu Xiuwei, who is thirteen years old, came to Shanghai two months ago to study at McTyeire School. In Shanghai, she is taken care of by her younger sister, Huang Zhuoxiong. Her two sons, Wu Xiu Guang, eleven, and Wu Xiu Cheng, eight, are still in Nanjing and will soon be brought to Shanghai.</p>
<p>When asked if she was going to move, Madame Wu said, "This house is several times better than the one in Chongqing. I think it is really too extravagant. But I am like a country person, especially because of my poor health, I can't sleep at night in such a lively place, so I really want to find a quieter house."</p>
<p>Madame Wu is from Xiamen, Fujian, but grew up in Hankou. She is a language genius. Whether she speaks Hubei dialect, Mandarin, Shanghainese, or English, her pronunciation is clear and fluent. She is a top student of McTyeire School. According to her classmates, "Madame Wu was very gentle and elegant in school, and her Chinese foundation was particularly good." Madame Wu has a strong interest in Chinese painting and likes to paint. People who know her well know that she has no hobbies of wealthy ladies.</p>
<p>As I was leaving, Madame Wu gave me the impression that reminded me of Madame Chiang. It is said that Madame Chiang praised her highly. Indeed, in her demeanor and conversation, I found some similarities to Madame Chiang.</p>

<h3>Encountering a Wealthy Widow in Church: Accepting a Dinner Invitation, Unexpectedly Stabbed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] At around 9:00 PM last night, a Russian man named Ross Mikov was suddenly injured in front of house number 7, Lane 125, Albert Road. It turns out that the day before, on Sunday, Luo went to a church on Henry Road for Mass and met a wealthy Russian widow named Pan Niu (transliterated, living at house number 15, Lane 125, Albert Road) who he had not seen for a long time. They talked for a long time and hit it off, and as a result, Pan invited him to dinner at her house last night. When Luo arrived at the entrance of Pan's lane, a person suddenly appeared in the dark, took out a dagger, and stabbed Luo severely in the abdomen, causing him to collapse immediately. However, he still shouted for help loudly, and the murderer took the opportunity to escape without a trace. Dr. Howf Ke Mike, a Russian doctor living at number 8, heard the alarm and came out to investigate, quickly helped Luo up, bandaged the wound, and reported it to the Foreign Affairs Section of the Lujiawan Police Station, who called a car to send him to the hospital for treatment. The widow, Shen, heard the news and went to the police station to report the details of what happened. The escaped murderer is being hunted. It is reported that the cause of the case may be a love triangle.</p>

<h3>A Special Record of Welcoming the New and Bidding Farewell to the Old: Subordinates Lingered Outside the Gate to Bid Farewell; Distinguished Guests Repeatedly Congratulated in the Building</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Jiangxi Road City Hall was already crowded with people who wanted to catch a glimpse of the new mayor's demeanor. When the clock at the Jianghai Customs struck nine o'clock, the people whispered, "He's here!"</p>
<p>A black car drove up quickly, and the police excitedly cheered. Mayor Wu stepped out of the car with a smile, and Director Xuan of the Police Bureau, who had been waiting at the door, led Mayor Wu to the second floor, where Mayor Qian pleasantly came out to greet him in person.</p>
<p>At 9:05 AM, the memorial week attended by the new and old mayors simultaneously began. Photographers were busy taking pictures, and everyone was filled with excitement as they listened to the new mayor's first announcement to the more than three million people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, the memorial week ended, and Mayor Qian personally handed over the large seal wrapped in yellow satin to the new mayor. Ten minutes later, former Mayor Qian bid farewell to the new mayor. From the second floor all the way to the city government gate, it was densely packed with city government staff who were reluctant to part. Mayor Wu personally sent him to the gate, and in the melodious music, former Mayor Qian stepped into the car.</p>
<p>From the car window, former Mayor Qian stretched out his hand and waved goodbye to the many subordinates who were seeing him off, bidding farewell to the city government where he had worked diligently for eight months. These were eight months full of turbulent waves! The people of Shanghai will always be grateful for his efforts to manage the city through difficult times.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu returned to the office, where he began to review the first official document, which was a draft of the announcement of his assumption of office. He wrote the word "Zhen" on it, and after thinking for a moment, wrote "May 20." This bright red announcement was posted at 10:25 AM, attracting countless citizens.</p>
<p>Next, the mayor received the bureau chiefs in the reception room. At 10:10 AM, the newly appointed Director of Finance, Gu Chunfan, arrived from Nanjing to pay his respects. At that time, congratulatory guests were pouring in, and the city government received 94 congratulatory name cards. The first to arrive was Wang Xiaolai. Mayor Wu received them all one by one and was extremely busy. At 10:50 AM, Secretary-General He Dekui accompanied the mayor on a tour of the city government offices. At 11:05 AM, Pan Gongzhan, the president of this newspaper, arrived at the city government to offer his congratulations. Wei Xubai from the News Release Group hurried to report, and the mayor immediately stopped the inspection, met with Pan, and personally sent him off. Of the many congratulatory guests yesterday, the mayor personally sent off only Mr. Pan. After Mr. Pan said goodbye, the mayor continued to inspect the various offices and gladly signed his autograph on his photo for the reporter.</p>
<p>At noon, the mayor went to the 13-story building on Muirhead Road for a banquet. At 3:00 PM, he returned to the city government and convened an emergency meeting on food, which was watched by the entire city of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu was still wearing the gray suit he wore when he flew to Shanghai that day. He looked happy and had a smile on his face—but because he was busy with official duties, he had only four hours of sleep each night these past few days! The Mayor's wife is already concerned about his health.</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu returned to the office, the city government's tea boy immediately asked everyone what kind of tea the mayor liked to drink. After someone told him "plain tea," cups of plain tea were continuously delivered. If the host drinks plain tea, the guests are naturally welcome to do the same. Four large water bottles were still not enough, as there were simply too many guests.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Eighteen District Offices Being Accused of Election Fraud Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wei Yunong, the principal of Shanghai Pei Middle and Elementary School and the chief of the 31st Bao in the 18th District, filed a lawsuit against the District Office, claiming that there was election fraud in the district's municipal councilor election and requesting that the election be declared invalid. The case was opened for trial by Judge Xu Fuji in the Civil Division Six of the District Court at 9:30 AM yesterday morning. The defendant was represented by the legal representative, District Chief Cao Ziyan, and defended by lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Feng Xizui. The plaintiff's lawyer was Lu Zhaohai. First, Judge Xu questioned the plaintiff about the election fraud, and then questioned District Chief Cao, who completely denied the allegations. Then, the plaintiff's witnesses, Zhang Min, Yu Rende, Mu Xiangxiaogui, Yu Qianjinfeng, and Wei Yanpei, were examined one by one, and they testified about the fraud they had seen or experienced. It was nothing more than the scribe intentionally misspelling the candidate's name, the supervisors withholding ballots, and some minor conflicts, but they did not see any beatings or other fraud. District Chief Cao testified that a total of 60,371 ballots were issued in the district, and only 57,385 were received, of which 827 were invalid. After Lawyer Lu Zhaohai's request, Judge Xu ordered the defendant to submit the ballot boxes and voter signature books to the court for inspection that afternoon, and then adjourned the trial for further hearing. According to confirmed information, the defendant only submitted one large box of ballots and twelve signature books to the District Court's receiving and dispatch office at 5:27 PM yesterday afternoon, still missing 36 signature books. Also, when the trial opened yesterday, Wei Yunong was helped into the courtroom by his wife because his body was still injured from being hit by a Jeep car. Another plaintiff in a municipal councilor election lawsuit, Lawyer Xia Gongkai, was also listening quietly in the audience.</p>

<h3>A Cab Driver Was Scammed and Robbed; Two Russian Offenders Were Apprehended</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] A driver, He Guofu, was hired to drive a Jinghu Garrison Commander's car which was stationed at Nanjing Road Bund from time to time. Thus, He Guofu came to know two Russian youths, one named Yaokov (17 years old) and the other named Pailikov (18 years old).

<h3>The Ministry of Education Orders Seven Cities Including Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin to Recover School Buildings as Soon as Possible and Requests That the Executive Yuan Instruct Occupying Agencies to Return Them Early</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper] After the victory of the War of Resistance, major cities were restored and the population increased sharply, and the number of children out of school increased. Therefore, national schools must be restored to their original state as much as possible, and the number of students enrolled should be expanded so that school-age children can go to school and not be disappointed. However, the population in various places has increased, and the number of schools has decreased compared to before the war. The biggest reason for this is that, in addition to the damage to school buildings during the war, many were borrowed and occupied by other agencies at the time of victory. Therefore, the immediate restoration of schools has been somewhat affected. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has ordered the educational authorities of cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, and Harbin to restore schools as soon as possible to provide relief to out-of-school children in those cities. For school buildings damaged by the enemy and puppets, such as those with portions that can still be barely used, they should be used as much as possible. If the school buildings have been used for other purposes, they should also be recovered as soon as possible to facilitate the restoration of schools. It is also reported that in order to assist the local authorities in recovering school buildings, the Ministry of Education has also submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, requesting that it instruct the military, government, and other agencies occupying primary school buildings to return the buildings as soon as possible for school restoration purposes.

<h3>Fu Sinian Talks About the Re-establishment of Peking University</h3>
<p>Opening on October 1st in Peiping</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Peiping] Peking University President-designate Fu Sinian has come to Peiping specifically to prepare for the re-establishment of the university. According to Mr. Fu, the university is scheduled to open on October 1st in Peiping. Professors and students will arrive in batches from the south. The College of Engineering will be jointly operated with Tsinghua University, with Tsinghua in charge. Apart from the Dean of the Medical College, all other deans and professors have been appointed. Before the war, there were 1,200 students; this number is expected to triple in the future, so the issue of school buildings must be resolved soon. The temporary university preparatory class is scheduled to conclude at the end of the month. The College of Liberal Arts at Peking University can accommodate 250 students, Tsinghua University 80, and Nankai University 70. The College of Science at Peking University can accommodate 200 students. The College of Law at Peking University can accommodate 300 students, and Nankai and Tsinghua Universities can each accommodate 200. Transfer students will not be accepted this year. It is hoped that an English preparatory class can be organized during the summer. As for student movements, today's student standards are not sufficient to produce talents for future national construction. It is hoped that students can focus on their studies and specialize in academic pursuits. Academic freedom is absolute, but it should not be used as a tool for political struggle.</p>
<h3>He Bingsong Cables the Ministry of Education, Resolutely Declining the Presidency of Yingshi University</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Education has ordered He Bingsong, President of Jinan University, to be transferred to the presidency of National Yingshi University. The vacancy left by him at Jinan University will be filled by Li Shouyong, Director of the Shanghai Temporary University. It is learned that He Bingsong, due to his ill health, has cabled Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, requesting permission to decline the new position at Yingshi University. The original cable reads as follows: "Bingsong was ordered to serve at Jinan University and has been there for over ten years, wasting time without making any achievements, only daring not to resign due to the time of the War of Resistance. Recently reading in the newspapers, I learned that the Ministry has transferred me to the presidency of Yingshi University, which I believe is true. I should obey, but Bingsong has been suffering from various illnesses in recent years and cannot bear the heavy workload. In addition, the three colleges of Yingshi University focus on agriculture and engineering, which are not my expertise, and I am sure to encounter difficulties in personnel organization. Acting rashly would be of no benefit to either the public or private sectors. Now that a successor has been found for the presidency of Jinan University, please grant Bingsong the opportunity to retire and recuperate. Therefore, I earnestly request your permission to decline the new position to avoid causing delays, and I am extremely grateful. Due to illness, I am unable to go to the capital to explain in person, and I beg for your consideration."</p>
<h3>Tianjin Education Bureau Issues Documents to Various Schools, Striving for Simplification and Speed</h3>

<h3>Hangzhou People's Education Center Starts Installation of Public Bathhouse, Cooperating with the Ministry's Key Tasks</h3>

<h3>President Ju of the Judicial Yuan Lectures on Law and Ethics at Soochow University, Citing Mencius's "Blind Man Killing" as an Example</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Ju Juesheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, was invited by Dr. Sheng Zhenwei, Acting President of Soochow University, to lecture to law students at the university's auditorium at 5 p.m. last week on Monday. Mr. Ju, over sixty years old, was energetic and spoke frankly in light robes and cloth shoes. After an introduction by Acting President Sheng to the students, Mr. Ju began his lecture, citing Mencius's chapter "Shun Being Emperor, Gao Yao Being a Judge, and the Blind Man Killing," to clarify the relationship between law and ethics. The enforcement of the law should be strict, as the saying goes, "enforcing the law is like a mountain." The mountain can sometimes be moved, but Nan Mountain cannot be moved; this is the responsibility of Futaot. The blind man and Shun were father and son, and the law should be upheld, but the common human sentiments cannot be violated. Only by seeking righteousness in both human feelings and legal principles can one be worthy of the Mandate of Heaven and serve as a model for the people. Therefore, Shun abandoned the world as if it were worn-out shoes, conforming to Heaven and responding to the people, to avoid making mistakes. The original intention of legislation is not about individualism or familism, but about nationalism, which has evolved and changed over time. However, from having a body and a family to forming an ancient patriarchal society and finally maturing the concept of the state, the evolution over thousands of years has never deviated from ethical relationships. It depends on ethics to remedy the deficiencies of the law, so that the application of the law has room for maneuver and does not cause obstacles. That is why our War of Resistance was able to persist for eight years and ultimately achieve final victory, which was also maintained by this ethics and this integrity. Mr. Ju is a trustee of the university, and his care for the school and his guidance of students are meticulous. This lecture was warmly welcomed by the students of the university.</p>

<h3>The Most Serious Problem in Taiwan Province Today: Teacher Shortage</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei] According to Minzhi News Agency: Since the restoration of Taiwan, education has been an important task for building a new Taiwan. Fan Choukang, Director of the Department of Education, has particularly emphasized promoting education in Taiwan Province as his duty. It is reported that this year's education budget is over 160 million yuan, accounting for 9% of the total budget. The promotion of Mandarin and Chinese language is also underway, with Mandarin promotion centers being established in various counties and cities, and it is expected that it will be widespread within two years. However, the most serious problem at present is the teacher shortage. Currently, there are 302 qualified secondary school teachers and 1,500 primary school teachers, which is far from the actual need. The 200 or so Mandarin teachers recently hired from Xiamen are also not enough to distribute.</p>

<h3>Teachers and Staff of Municipal Secondary Schools Issue Open Letter to Compatriots</h3>
<p>Urging the Government to Implement Adjustment Proposals</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Liaison Association of Teachers and Staff of Municipal Secondary Schools in this city, in order to urge the government to implement the Legislative Yuan's proposed method of adjusting the salaries and allowances of public school teachers and staff, has issued an open letter to compatriots, stating: "We, the teachers and staff of municipal secondary schools in Shanghai, previously demanded improved treatment due to low salaries and living pressures, and implemented a slowdown in teaching. Later, the Education Bureau launched the Teacher Appreciation Movement, hoping to obtain social assistance to alleviate the teachers' plight, for which we are grateful. However, the allowance of 160,000 yuan issued to each person this semester (80,000 yuan has already been issued) is only a temporary painkiller. The colleagues should continue to strive to achieve the goal of improving treatment, without violating the principle of understanding arising from the Education Bureau's painstaking relief.</p>
<h3>Four Strong Basketball Championship Game, First Match Tonight at 7 PM, Swatow Team vs. West Youth, Lianghua vs. Signal Corps, Proceeds to Be Used for Basketball Court Flooring</h3>
<p>The Four Strong Basketball Championship Game organized by the Municipal Sports Association Basketball Committee to raise funds for the construction of the flooring, with the participation of the Lianghua, Swatow, Signal Corps, and West Youth teams, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. today at the Municipal Gymnasium. The Chinese Athletic Federation could not join due to insufficient numbers, but the team stated that they will challenge the champion of the Four Strong in a best-of-three series in the future.</p>
<p>The program includes two games, Swatow Team vs. West Youth, Lianghua vs. Signal Corps. Tickets are priced at 1,000 yuan for the upper floor and 2,000 yuan for the lower floor. There are also numbered honorary seats in the stadium for 10,000 yuan. Military police must also purchase tickets to enter the stadium. All proceeds, after deducting expenses, will be used for the construction of the flooring. At that time, the Four Dimensions Boy Scouts will be present to maintain order, and the band from the refugee and orphan reception center will perform.</p>
<p>Chairman Wu Shaoshu donated a large silver cup to reward the winners of the Four Strong to encourage them, and Mr. Wu will personally present the award on Saturday.</p>
<p>Also, the Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament has ended. Silver cups will be presented after tonight's games. It is hoped that the male and female championship teams will send representatives to the stadium to receive them. The order of tonight's games is as follows:</p>
<p>Swatow Team vs. West Youth, 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Lianghua vs. Signal Corps, 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Two Fierce Battles</p>
<p>The Swatow-West Youth war drum will sound first. Old players such as Ma Canxi, He Lide, and Chen Qingjiang have all returned, and the front line is strong and cannot be underestimated. The team is known for its speed and has a unique style of play. Showing off their skills again tonight, they should be able to accomplish something. West Youth gathers the elite of the Giants and Encarnacion, and Tao Bolinji, Founik, and Sasha King are all among the best. In addition, Carson is cunning, and the "black" Bert is fierce and good at fighting, so their strength is extremely abundant. There will definitely be a fierce battle with the Swatow team.</p>
<p>The finale is Lianghua vs. Signal Corps. Lianghua has been working hard since losing the Mayor's Cup. The northern players such as Li Zhenzhong, Tang Baokun, and Shen Yugong are skilled in basketball, which goes without saying, and Liu Fushan and Wu Bixian are also very brave. Although Liu Zhenyuan has gone to Wuhan, Zhang Shaoqing is helping out, so the fighting power has not diminished. The US 3198 Signal Corps is the champion of the Mayor's Cup. Not only are they energetic, but their tactics are also superb. They are the best among the US military teams. This is the first time they have encountered a strong enemy, Lianghua. Both sides have their own characteristics. The outcome of this dragon and tiger fight is unknown.</p>
<p>(Swatow Team) Lin Zuoshi (Leader), Chen Qingjiang (Captain), Lin Weicong, Ma Canxi, He Lide, Zhou Bin, Xu Zhan, Lin Ziliang.</p>
<p>(West Youth) Tao Bolinji, Founik, N. Sasha King, T. Sasha King, Steven, Carson, Kajmir, Johnson, Qiang Dulai, Bert.</p>
<p>(Lianghua) Xu Songguo (Leader), Tang Baokun (Captain), Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, Wu Bixian, Zhang Shaoqing, Liu Fushan, Tao Lin, Wang Lewu.</p>
<p>(Signal Corps) Pigan, Trum, Mania, Angeli, Max, Seler, Slaftoff, Jihui.</p>
<h3>Amidst the National Restoration, the Activities of National Secondary Schools Remaining in Sichuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing] After the victory against Japan, in addition to the relocation of various schools out of Sichuan Province and back to their original locations, the activities of specialist schools and above and national secondary schools approved by the Ministry of Education to remain in Sichuan are as follows: (1) National Women's Normal College, located in Baisha, Restoration plan: relocate to Chongqing. (2) National Central Technical Arts College, located in Leshan, Restoration relocate to Santai. (3) National Central Industrial Vocational School, located in Shapingba, Restoration remain in Chongqing. (4) National Central Technical Arts College Branch School, located in Zigong, Restoration renamed Zigong Technical School. (5) National No. 16 Middle School, located in Yongchuan, Restoration handed over to Sichuan Province for management. (6) National No. 18 Middle School, located in Santai, Restoration handed over to Sichuan Province for management. (7) National Women's Middle School, located in Hejiang, Restoration handed over to Sichuan Province for management. (8) National Chongqing Normal School, located in Beibei, Restoration handed over to Sichuan Province for management. Its principal, Ma Kemu, was transferred to the presidency of Jiangsu Provincial Jiangning Normal School. (9) National Women's Normal School, located in Luoqi Town, Jiangbei County, Restoration handed over to Sichuan Province for management. (10) National Labor Normal School, located in Qingmuguan, Restoration handed over to Sichuan Province for management. (11) National Jiangjin Normal School, located in Jiangjin, Restoration handed over to Sichuan Province for management. (12) National Rongchang Normal School, located in Rongchang, Restoration handed over to Sichuan Province for management. (13) National Sichuan Aquatic Vocational School, located in Hechuan, Restoration plan: the original school will be closed, and the school property will be handed over to Sichuan Province. (Ann) Correspondents, legislative proposal for newspaper donations, already showing the plight of public school teachers and staff, suggesting to the Executive Yuan to improve the treatment of public school teachers and staff, with a monthly subsidy of 200,000 yuan and a base salary of 1,000 times as the scope, the proposal was announced, and public opinion was excited. However, according to news from the newspapers, the National Defense Council believed that if the Legislative Yuan's proposed method was implemented, the huge amount of the budget would be recorded with astronomical numbers. However, they did not consider that the inflation and the small value of legal tender already require differential calculus to calculate. We believe that today the government has no reason to reject the Legislative Yuan's adjustment proposal. According to the Legislative Yuan's proposal to adjust salaries and allowances, the wages of workers have reached 3,000 times, and the prices of necessities such as rice, fuel, cloth, and houses have risen to 5,000 to 10,000 times. The original proposal advocated that the salary should be 1,000 times and the living allowance should be 200,000 yuan, which has taken into account the government's actual ability to bear the burden. How can the government ignore this fact and place the lives of public school teachers and staff in trouble? Today, we solemnly declare once again that the government should accept the reasonable adjustment proposal of the Legislative Yuan and implement it from March onwards. Otherwise, for the sake of life and education, the colleagues may take more effective measures than a slowdown in teaching.</p>

<h3>Reader Replies – Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Yao Ziyu asks: My residence was completely destroyed by enemy forces in November of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]. Now, because the Township Office, following orders from above, has issued a property loss report form, I have some doubts about the second-to-last column, "Value at Time of Loss." I would like to ask if I should fill in the value at the time of the loss in the 26th year. My relatives and friends have discussed this and suggested that I fill in the value at the time of submission. I am asking you to provide a public reply.</p>
<p>Attorney Chuan Kuang-lin replies:</p>
<p>The "Value at Time of Loss" in the attached form naturally refers to the value at the time of the loss, as filled in the first column of the same form, and not the value at the time of reporting. This is very clear.</p>
<p>(2) Liu Bing-san asks: After the victory of the War of Resistance, there was a provision to protect the marriages of soldiers who fought in the war. Conversely, if a wife not only fails to support the household and care for her parents while her husband is away at war for several years, but also leaves the family and ignores everything, and doesn't even return when her father-in-law passes away, and does this for more than two years, and then decides she no longer wants her carefree, dissolute life and returns to her husband's family, what kind of protection should such a person receive? She has made no contribution to the family, no help to her husband, and is detrimental to her husband's future and family harmony. If the husband is determined to divorce her, is he protected legally? What kind of protection should the law protecting the marriages of soldiers who fought in the war provide in this case? Please reply.</p>
<p>[Attorney Chuan Kuang-lin replies:] One spouse must have grounds listed in Article 1052 of the Civil Code before the other spouse can request a divorce from the court.</p>
<p>(3) Liu Bing-nan asks: When I was seven years old, my parents arranged a betrothal with a girl from the same village. Later, when my younger brother reached adulthood, he expressed his disapproval. At the same time, due to the war, he followed the school to Chongqing. Last year, after the victory, my younger brother asked a lawyer to publish a notice in the newspaper rejecting the engagement and declaring it invalid. The other party strongly refuted this with a notice in the newspaper. If my younger brother now chooses to marry someone else, will there be any problems? If the woman returns home and causes trouble or litigation, what should we do legally? Please advise.</p>
<p>[Attorney Zhu Ya-kui replies:] (1) According to Article 11 of the revised Code of Civil Procedure, the court may increase the amount of compensation at its discretion. (2) Since the engagement was made without your consent, it is invalid. (3) If the woman sues, you can request that the case be dismissed.</p>
<p>(4) Tang Yaoji asks: The reader is originally from Likou Township in Suzhou. In the past, my father bought two rooms (i.e., pawned-bought) of a house from Wu Er'a in the local area. Since the Japanese invaders occupied the Beijing-Shanghai line in the winter of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], the reader has lost contact with his family and wandered alone, serving in the army and engaging in the War of Resistance for eight years. After the victory, I returned to my hometown last winter to visit my relatives, but when I arrived in the town, it was no longer the same as before.

<h3>Bank of China Vigorously Suppresses the Black Market: Gold Prices Rise and Then Fall; Highest Price Reached 2 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the domestic situation deteriorated further, and rumors were rampant. Due to the Bank of China's regulation, the market price in this city was much lower than in other ports across the country, causing all kinds of traveling merchants and scattered funds to focus on purchasing gold. The price rose to over 2 million yuan. The Bank of China was forced to make emergency sales to the black market in addition to allocations. After a period of firmness, a reversal began. The opening price in the morning was slightly soft. After the close, it immediately rose, but hesitated slightly around 1.95 million yuan. After 10:00 AM, it had steadily stood above 1.96 million yuan. The Bank of China allocated 425 out of 450 registered companies in the same industry (temporarily canceling 25) at 1.97 million yuan. After the allocation was completed, the speculators, as always, immediately stirred up the market price, raising it to a new high of 2.03 million yuan. The Bank of China, at this point, intensified its attacks, fiercely dumping more than 1,000 bars on the black market, putting unprecedented pressure on the market. This move left speculators gasping for air. In an instant, the price fell below the opening price, seeing a low price of 1.91 million yuan. Generally, unregistered individuals asked help from North and South money shops to purchase. The prices rose to around 1.95 million yuan, but because the prevailing winds had already changed and most people liquidated positions, and because Tianjin merchants had stopped buying, the pressure from the Bank of China remained high. Not advancing was like retreating. In the afternoon, it finally broke through the 1.9 million yuan mark, falling to a low price of 1.86 million yuan, before stabilizing slightly. As a result, it fell 10,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. After 3:00 PM, forward trading was conducted, calling for prices as high as 1.9 million yuan. Ornamental gold was listed at 200,200 yuan, refined silver at 1,700 yuan, and silver dollars were offered for sale at 1,180 yuan. Due to the loose money supply, the unofficial interest rates varied from around 1.5 to 1.8 fen.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Affected by the Current Situation: Decline Steadily After Opening</h3>
<p>Due to political instability, government bonds experienced sluggish buying interest. Although a certain major securities firm initiated speculation to attract floating funds, it was still difficult to revive the market. The Unified Bing Bond gradually fell from 6,600 yuan, struggling at the 6,000 yuan mark at noon. As a result, it fell 550 yuan compared to the previous close. Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu bonds also fell around 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Thread Reach New High Prices: Active Trading in Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market experienced rapid price fluctuations. In the early morning, the momentum of the previous day's dramatic rise and the news that gold prices had broken through the 2 million mark led to a frantic rise in both coarse and fine yarn. The highest price for 20-count special Double Horse yarn was 1.4 million yuan, and the 42-count Double Strand Blue Phoenix thread also reached 2.65 million yuan, both of which were new highs for the year. However, they were fleeting. Before long, the price of gold fell, and factories such as Shenxin sold off at high prices. It was recorded that 20-count Double Horse yarn was priced at 1.35 million yuan, and peers followed suit to sell, until the closing price was still 50,000-60,000 yuan higher than last weekend. However, the closing prices of various brands of 42-count thread fell by 30,000 yuan. At noon, the Textile Construction Administration opened yarn as usual. The prices of coarse yarns above 10 counts increased by 10,000 to 40,000 yuan, 20 counts increased by 90,000 yuan, and 32 to 100 counts increased by 160,000 to 200,000 yuan. Buyers were not very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Cloth merchants and retailers were stirred up, and the market was uniformly prosperous. Apart from Shilin cloth remaining stable, other brands increased by 1,000-2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In the cotton market, New York American cotton rose slightly by 1-9 points. The near-term price for American cotton was $27.16, the long-term price was $27.71, and the current price for middling cotton was $27.76. Raw cotton sales were brisk and prices were high in this city. The Shenxin No. 1 Factory purchased 1,350 bales of middling, Uruguayan, and Brazilian cotton. There was also much inter-trade.</p>
<h3>US Dollars Rise and Fall with Gold: Arbitrage Transactions Are Quite Popular</h3>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars rose and fell with the gold market. Arbitrage was more popular than stocks. The arbitrage spread gradually narrowed by more than ten yuan from 800 yuan per ten taels. After opening at 2,410 yuan in the morning, it repeatedly rose to over 2,500 yuan. As the gold market fell back, it fell back to 2,370 yuan in the afternoon before stabilizing. As a result, it fell slightly by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. The final arbitrage spread was close to 787.5 yuan per ten taels. The inventory of Hong Kong banknotes was extremely depleted, making it difficult to collect. Old banknotes were even scarcer, rising 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong electricity rose from 430 yuan to 440 yuan, while Robi was 540 yuan. US dollar listings remained flat. Designated banks were reluctant to sell at a price below 2,100 yuan. Frozen drafts were settled with the Bank of China at a price of 2,000 yuan, with agent banks requiring a commission of 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Bank Shanghai Branch Opens</h3>
<p>Handling Small Remittances</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Taiwan Bank officially opened at its address on Broadway yesterday. According to Xie Huiyuan, the manager of the bank, the former Taiwan Bank, which was under enemy control, has been reorganized after being taken over. It is now operated by our government and still named the Taiwan Bank. Its Taipei head office and more than ten branch offices throughout Taiwan were officially established yesterday. Based on the more than 3 billion Taiwan dollars issued by the enemy, the bank is now issuing new Taiwan dollars. Regarding commercial exchanges between Shanghai and Taiwan, the bank can temporarily handle small remittances, still following the "Preferential Measures for Family Members of Public Officials in Taiwan Province" established by the Taiwan Provincial Government, with a standard exchange rate of 1 Taiwan dollar equivalent to 30 yuan in legal tender. In the future, regarding general commercial exchange issues between Shanghai and Taiwan, the bank will consult with the Central Bank, transfer funds, and determine how to set the exchange rate before large-scale operations can begin. Currently, the bank is still conducting ordinary banking business.</p>
<h3>Domestic Tea Market Remains Strong: Export Development Difficult Due to Costs Exceeding US Market Prices</h3>
<p>Shops in Japan Street and Wuxi Suzhou and other places are gradually opening their doors because the low-end red and green tea is selling very well, but there is very little high-end goods. As for the Tianjin merchants, sales are still sluggish. Observing the current situation, although prices have not risen, it is not easy to retreat either. People's hearts are leaning towards firmness, and most shippers are waiting for prices to rise.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of Jiuxing Tea Company, telling the United Credit Reporting Agency: The Qihong sample sent to the Irving Trust Company in the United States by the company recently received a reply from the United States, who hope that the price of tea in our country will not exceed 3.5 cents per pound in US dollars, because the United States has a set standard for importing various goods, and it is very difficult to import goods with a higher price than the standard. However, it is currently impossible to export tea from the Shanghai market at 3.5 cents per pound in US dollars. This price is only enough to buy from the production area in our country. The market price in Shanghai currently requires about 5 cents per pound in US dollars, so if you want to export, you will not make a profit unless it is above 8 cents in US dollars. Therefore, it is currently difficult to develop tea export trade.</p>
<h3>Gloom Envelops the Stock Market: Extremes Must Reverse, the Future is Highly Worrying</h3>
<p>Major Chinese stock investors are scattering, and the groups that conduct matched trades are also showing signs of disintegration. Some have abandoned Chinese stocks and switched to government bonds, resulting in increased neglect. After gold prices surged, there was a reversal, with a temporary rebound in the middle, but it was very short-lived. Low prices were still seen at noon. Yongsha retreated from 5,250 yuan to 4,830 yuan, Maya retreated from 4,150 yuan to 3,650 yuan, Jingfu fell from 305 yuan to 255 yuan, Xinguang fell from 248 yuan to within 200 yuan, and Qinxing retreated from 225 yuan to 155 yuan. The afternoon closed slightly stable. Yong'an Company, because it is registered in the United States, can avoid taxation. There is news of a one-for-nine stock split, although it fell, it was held up by the buying activities of general yarn factories. As a result, it fell by slightly more than half or even a strong tenth compared to last Saturday. Small, low-volume stocks and veteran stocks fell limitedly, and foreign stocks were also slightly affected. Yisha gradually declined from 12,200 yuan, and Yinglian from 11,100 yuan. The afternoon closing continued to fall by about 10% compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Stable and Elegant Timber Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the timber market conditions were stable and firm. Decoration materials such as Lauan, Phoebe, and plywood have seen their prices rise. Western pine is also elegant. It is said that many buyers in this city are transporting goods to Nanjing for sale, so prices are consistently optimistic.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's First Statement Upon Taking Office: Suppress Rice Prices with Emergency Measures, Strictly Investigate Hoarding and Permit Reporting, Prohibit Non-Industry Speculation and Price Hikes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] As the newly appointed Mayor Wu began his term, rice prices were soaring. The general public was eagerly awaiting how to suppress market prices and regulate the food supply.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>Mayor Wu held an emergency meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM. In addition to Secretary-General He De-kui and Social Affairs Bureau Chief Wu Kai-xian from the Municipal Government, attendees included Du Yue-sheng, President of the Local Autonomy Association, Wang Xiao-lai, President of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Liu Gong-yun, Director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, Shen De-ren, Representative of the Food Administration Office, Chen Hang, Vice President of the Central Bank, Li Ming, President of the Banking Association, Xu Ji-qing and Feng You-zhen from the Provisional Municipal Council, Qu Zhen-hua, Zhang Xi-chao, Yang Run-yu, and Chen Shao-lian, Standing Directors of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, Wan Mo-lin, Representative of Rice Shops, and Xing Zhi-gang, Wu Rong-sheng, Zhu Yong-ming, and Gu Yi-sheng, Representatives of the Soybean and Rice Industry. Mayor Wu personally presided over the meeting, first explaining the significance of the meeting, then listening to the opinions of the rice industry representatives, and finally jointly deciding on four emergency measures for rice and food in the city, which were handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau for immediate implementation. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Protect Grain Merchants, Suppress Hoarding</p>
<p>After the meeting, Mayor Wu met with reporters and made a statement on the matter, saying, "I attach great importance to the food supply for the people. This meeting was held to solve this problem. However, according to various surveys, grain merchants in this city have 500,000 shi of rice in storage, and citizens have 300,000 shi of rice in storage, for a total of 900,000 shi. Estimating that the city needs about 300,000 shi per month, it can last for three months. In terms of supply sources, Chairman Chiang has instructed Sichuan to ship 2 million dan of rice to Shanghai to supply the market. The Ministry of Food has ordered 70,000 tons of foreign rice from South America Brazil, and grain merchants have also ordered 25,000 tons of foreign rice. Domestic rice is also constantly coming to Shanghai, so rice prices should not rise. There is clearly hoarding and speculative manipulation. The city's future food policy will be to protect legitimate grain merchants and suppress speculation and hoarding. For this reason, four measures have been agreed upon and have been handed over to Director Wu for thorough implementation, and the rice merchants have been instructed to comply."</p>
<p>Four Measures Implemented by the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>The four emergency measures are as follows: First, grain merchants are required to register their grain storage in the city with the Social Affairs Bureau within three days, with the deadline set for the 23rd. Afterwards, any increases or decreases must also be registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. Those who fail to report by the deadline or conceal information will be subject to confiscation. Citizens are encouraged to report violations, and if the report is verified, 50% of the hoarded rice will be used as a reward. Second, non-rice merchants are prohibited from engaging in the rice business, and violators will be severely punished. Third, all transactions must be registered by the guild, including the names, addresses, prices, and transaction quantities of the parties involved. Fourth, transaction information for the ten days from May 10th to May 20th must be submitted retroactively in order to thoroughly investigate the cause of the recent price increases. After receiving the order, Social Affairs Bureau Chief Wu immediately returned to the bureau and issued several emergency orders, urging warehouses and money shops to quickly and accurately report the rice stored by their members. He also announced that unauthorized individuals are prohibited from illegally buying and selling rice. If there is concealment or false reporting, the public is allowed to report it, and the privately hoarded rice will be confiscated and half will be used as a reward.</p>
<p>Chairman Orders Exemption from Inspection for Shipped Grain</p>
<p>It has been decided that 2 million shi of Sichuan rice will be transported by the Minsheng, Sanbei, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Companies in sections. Chairman Chiang specially ordered the military and police along the way to exempt inspections. The Municipal Government received a telegram from the Executive Yuan on the 18th of this month, stating, "Chairman Chiang Zhen telegraphed that all ships transporting grain downstream the Sichuan River should be exempted from inspection and not be delayed. In addition to telegraphed orders to the military and police inspection agencies to comply, please be informed and comply accordingly."</p>
<p>Yesterday's Rice Prices Fell by 5,000-6,000</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw a slight easing in the interior, and after consecutive price increases, prices were too high, and shop sales decreased, so the buying interest weakened, resulting in a uniform drop of 5,000-6,000 for both Japonica and Indica yuan rice. Flour also fell by 400-500 yuan accordingly. The oil market also fell by 5,000-6,000 yuan along with various commodities. Yellow beans fell by 2,000-3,000 yuan, raw peanuts fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan, sesame was weak by 1,000 yuan, and soybean cake supply exceeded demand, falling by a small 400-500 yuan. All grains declined uniformly, and all followed rice prices as a shift. Yesterday, rice arrivals in this city, according to information from the rice market, totaled more than 6,000 shi. The types and quantities are as follows: white Japonica 3,965 shi, sheep Indica 133 shi, thin paddy 711 shi, Du Indica 352 shi, early rice 1,322 shi, and Wan Indica 244 shi.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] It is reported that rice merchants in this city have purchased about 80 train cars of Indica rice in Wuhu, each car containing about 250 bags. They are currently stranded in Nanjing and will be shipped to Shanghai in batches as soon as transportation becomes available.</p>
<p>Also, it has been reported that Annam has begun accepting orders for grain. The authorities are considering contacting them to place orders in order to transport and sell the grain locally and solve the food problem.</p>
<h3>United States Urgently Needs Chinese Raw Silk and Tung Oil: Sending Agricultural Representatives to China to Investigate Transportation and Production</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington, 19th] In addition to sending an agricultural delegation to China and the Philippines, the United States will send another delegation to the Near East and Greece in mid-May. These four agricultural delegations are the first to go to war-torn areas since the end of the war. Their mission is to inspect, and their findings will determine the scope of future US technical assistance and guidance.</p>
<p>The agricultural delegation to China, recently announced, is visiting China at the invitation of the Chinese government. It will remain in China for five months and intends to cooperate closely with the Chinese government. It will contribute its advice in taking immediate action to deal with emergency problems and long-term plans to revive China's rural economy, which was destroyed by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Although the delegation's goals are long-term in nature, the more important ones will also be addressed immediately. In the latter regard, in order for China to obtain foreign exchange to pay for its needed imports, it must produce raw silk and tung oil. The United States urgently needs raw silk and tung oil, so the US delegation will investigate the bottlenecks delaying the transportation and production of these raw materials. This emergency assistance is an exception to the delegation's long-term goals. In fact, in terms of on-site assistance, technicians from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) have been carrying it out. UNRRA has also provided as much as possible the raw materials and equipment needed for China's emergency recovery work. In addition, the delegation will propose agricultural recovery plans suitable for cooperation between the two governments. At the same time, the delegation will be responsible for designating various plans, personnel, equipment, and institutions to assist in rebuilding Chinese agriculture.</p>
<p>The only name currently released is that of the delegation leader, Dr. Hogson, who is currently the Vice-President of the University of California and is very knowledgeable about silk, tea, and tung oil.</p>
<p>One member of the delegation summed up the delegation's goals in one sentence: "You can't build world peace on empty stomachs." Another member believes that the delegation is an instrument of peace in consolidating world understanding and eliminating differences between various races and ideologies.</p>
<h3>Indian and American Cotton Arrive One After Another</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Mr. Hastin, the manager of the Hualun Foreign Company, arrived in Shanghai last week. More than 12,000 pieces of cotton were shipped from the United States and are currently being unloaded at the Longmao Wharf. Also, the Haimuzhiya ship, managed by the British Steamship Company, arrived at the Wusongkou from Karachi, India, carrying 25,500 pieces of cotton and 3,800 tons of general merchandise, including a large quantity of railway materials. Because the port has no berths, it is temporarily anchored outside the port, waiting for a berth to be unloaded.</p>
<h3>Decline in Anthracite Coal</h3>
<p>Anthracite coal prices are seeing new lows amidst the high prices of other goods due to smooth sea transport between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao, reduced freight costs, and continuous increase in arrivals. Yangquan coal is the most abundant, and many Changcheng anthracite coals have recently been shipped to Shanghai. Jiaozuo anthracite coal is in short supply, and although the market is stable, sales are greatly affected. Factory owners are absorbing low-priced fine coal ash, so the market is reviving and prices are firm. Due to the high price of rice and grain, firewood and charcoal prices have risen at the source, and the recent arrivals have been relatively scarce, so the market continues to call for higher prices.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the artificial silk market, 120 Heaven Bridge grade silk with luster opened at 1.45 million yuan, and then rose following the rising gold prices, with the highest bid reaching 1.53 million yuan. Eventually, it fell to a closing price of 1.46 million yuan due to a lack of buying power and a return in gold prices. In the afternoon, it again called for a price drop of 40,000 yuan. As a result, it rose by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan compared to last weekend. Factory prices were firm, and foreign firms had no transactions. Suzhou merchants purchased five loads of medium-grade silk, priced at 1.9 million to 1.95 million yuan. The dried warp price did not open, and the asking price was similar to last weekend. For silk fabrics, American Asian quilt covers rose by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per 100 pieces, and Dacheng checkered crepe rose by 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Arrives but Does Not Sell: Domestic Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Recently, pure white oil has continued to arrive at various locations, although not in large quantities, but actual sales are poor, and export prospects remain bleak, so prices are slightly weak. The inventory of domestic tung oil, such as Xihong Jiyingfeng, is scarce, and prices have jumped to 125,000 yuan per barrel. Xihong miscellaneous brands have arrived steadily, and prices have plummeted within the 80,000 yuan range. It is reported that new goods from Jiangxi and Zhejiang, pure white oil, have already entered the market, and tung oil prices are trending downwards.</p>
<h3>Fifth Material Auction - Bidding Opens This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau, acting on behalf of the Government Materials and Property Committee, will hold its fifth auction of materials, consisting of eleven categories of items, including cotton yarn, fine cloth, poplin, rayon, etc. The deadline for submitting bids is 12:00 noon today, with the bidding opening at 2:00 PM. Additionally, some items from the third material auction—211 cases and 138 small packages of rayon, 1,160 bolts of fine cloth, and 76 bundles of 42-count blue phoenix double-strand thread—did not meet the internal reserve price with the highest bids and will be re-tendered per the CTB auction regulations. These have been included in the fifth material auction. It is reported that the winning bidders in the fourth material auction were eight firms: Da Feng Yarn and Cloth, Da Zhong, Jun Fu, Tong Tai Chang, Jiu Feng, Yuan Tai Chang, Zheng Xin, and Shen He Shun. It is also reported that 40 pieces of 32-count Globe yarn and 500 cases/packages of assorted 120-count rayon were not sold in the fourth auction.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Trade Stagnation</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, formerly a key port for foreign trade in South China, is still experiencing trade stagnation. The main reasons are the unstable currency system, heavy surtaxes, and the significant increase in the black market price of the Hong Kong dollar, making imports increasingly difficult. Guangzhou merchants cannot apply for foreign exchange locally and must apply in Shanghai, causing considerable frustration among merchants.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Protects Domestic Industry - Tax Exemption for Export of Native Yarn and Cloth - Import Tariffs Vary</h3>
<p>It has been learned that the Ministry of Finance, in order to protect domestic industry, will exempt exports of handicrafts, such as native cloth and yarn, from taxes. Import tariffs will vary depending on the nature of the goods. The tariff rates for commonly imported goods are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Import tariffs on machinery range from 7% to 10% depending on the nature of the machinery. (2) Tariffs on cotton cloth, knitted goods, woolens, etc., range from 25% to 40%. (3) Most luxury goods are not permitted for import. Those allowed are subject to particularly high tariffs. For example, the total duty, consolidated tax, and luxury surtax on cigarettes can reach 200%.</p>

<h3>Guixi's Urgent Tasks! Relief and Reform</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong reports from Guilin, Guixi - by airmail, 15th of the month</p>
<p>As the calendar enters the gate of summer, the suffering people seem to have transferred a little bit of their evil fate. The seasonal winds from the Indochina Peninsula bring a cloud of deep rain. Generous rain falls everywhere in the province. The old woman says Namo Amitabha again and again, and the desperate farmer hurries to hang the plow on his shoulder, turning the damp earth with sweat, "Bu Sha ah!" Bu Sha Island is also busy calling for people. But how does the hope bird know that poor farmers face multiple disasters? Grain seeds need to be borrowed, plows need to be borrowed, and fertilizer needs to be borrowed. The draught cattle that are as good as gods around the Zuo and You Rivers are generally suffering from plague again. The rain falls so un-lovable, and it is so difficult for the farmer to have a real laugh! The seeds have not yet been settled, and a small sprout of hope has sprouted in people's hearts. A storm is coming again, with an order for the purchase of 74,800 large packages or 150,000 city dan of military grain more urgent than fire. Expediting and collecting, even squeezing a little moisture out of the rice bran, is somewhat sad to say. Requests for postponement of reduction only get an unintelligible answer. The grain borrowed in the past few years has not been repaid. Just when the government is about to return it, an order for requisitioning military grain comes, so it is simply diverted, and what was borrowed becomes what is requisitioned. Those who had no grain to borrow before now have to take it out of their homes anyway, and they have to take it out quickly. In this way, the inextricable relationship between military grain and civilian food tightens the throats of many people even more.</p>
<p>A Game of Chess, Really Not Clever</p>
<p>After the new rain, prices (especially grain prices) have generally fallen. The highest record for rice prices in Guizhong once reached 90,000 yuan per city dan, but has now returned to between 30,000 and 40,000 yuan. Rice prices in Guilin are also relatively stable. The cheapest is around Nanning, selling for only more than 20,000 yuan. What is a bit bizarre and incomprehensible is that within the same province, each county prohibits the circulation of grain to other counties for adjustment, and this is done with solemn official pronouncements and strict prohibitions. As a result, in counties lacking grain, rice prices cannot fall for a few days before rising again. Not only rice, but all kinds of miscellaneous grains are the same. The result is that the barren become more barren, and the abundant become less abundant. (In places with sufficient grain, smuggling and hoarding occur in order to prohibit exports, which in turn stimulates grain prices. You understand that merchants are the most sensitive). On the one hand, people enthusiastically donate money for disaster relief, and on the other hand, they cruelly prohibit the export of grain. This move is really not very clever!</p>
<p>Large Bandits Are Becoming More Ferocious</p>
<p>Grain is a headache, but there is something else that is even more of a headache. During the period of shortages before the new harvest, bandits are becoming more and more ferocious and numerous, and the seriousness of the situation cannot be described with the word "exaggeration". A large bandit gang that operates around the Xijiang River area in Guixian County and the border areas of Gui (County) and Bin (Yang) is virtually a mechanized armed force, with heavy machine guns, light machine guns, mortars, American submachine guns, and supply trains. After looting a batch of cars on the highway a month ago, two ships sailing on the Xijiang River were attacked ten days ago. The escort self-defense team and the bandits engaged in a bloody battle fifty li below Guixian County. As a result, many sailors and passengers were killed and wounded, and the bandits looted three barges of goods worth more than 40 million before escaping with their booty. There are countless villages that are being dismantled one by one. It is said that there are no fewer than 4,000 people gathered together, led by a former traitor named Li, who obtained many weapons from the Japanese army. The teams maintaining local security are weakly armed, and are not only helpless (of course, they are trying hard to suppress the bandits, but whether they can suppress them is another matter), but also the county towns are sometimes somewhat alarmed. On the border between Yue and Gui, there is the so-called "People's Self-Defense Army" that roams and poisons people, and the "Revolutionary Army" of Vietnam also comes to the mainland to recruit soldiers. The situation is bizarre and indeed a bit worrying. In the final analysis, the word "hunger" creates this situation.</p>
<p>Going Downhill Is Not Allowed!</p>
<p>Today, people who take risks have reached the point where they no longer see the danger as a danger. Even women who cut grass in the mountains will kill passing solitary guests with sickles for a bag of rice. Clearing the countryside once can certainly eliminate many bandits, but the reaction will always create a little "forcing them to go up Liangshan" phenomenon. How can the officials who clear the countryside all be as pure as ice mirrors? Therefore, today's Guangxi politics must not only "relieve hunger" but also "reform officials". To give the smallest example: For example, Ao Yongling, the director of the Jinxiu area bureau, sold all the relief flour in Liuzhou to enrich himself. After being reported by the people, he only received a major demerit, which once caused some complaints. We sincerely say here: "Going downhill is absolutely not allowed"!</p>
<p>Branch Director Cries in Telegram</p>
<p>Since the Central News Agency issued the news that Relief Envoy Hoover would visit Guilin, a group of hungry people here have been eagerly awaiting him, thinking in their hearts: "If Hoover really comes to see Guilin, we will certainly get more than just this little bit of relief." But Mr. Hoover has disappointed people. Another piece of news that people heard was that Relief Branch Director Huang Ronghua sent an urgent telegram to Nanjing, the text of which is as follows: "Urgent, Director Jiang of the Nanjing Relief Headquarters... (on the road) The 3,000 tons of flour and 1,000 tons of rice received in this province are of no help. Thousands of hungry people are surrounding the office to petition, fortunately without causing trouble. Please urgently transport more food to Guilin for relief, otherwise, please give 3 million coffins and another position to me. Crying and begging, Huang Ronghua, prostrating."</p>
<p>Now, everyone is quietly waiting.</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Allied Pilots in Distress - A Historical Account of the Loquat Ripening Season</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondence from Northern Jiangsu, 16th of the Month, Cheng Tiean</p>
<p>"...Nine silver B-24 aircraft took off from a certain air base in the Philippines, ordered to scout the movements of enemy ships in the Yangtze River basin, each flying to its designated area to complete its mission. The plane we eleven people were flying was assigned for the sixth time to patrol the river surface around Shanghai, Haimen, Tongzhou, Chenggang and Qidong. On the night of June 14th, the crescent moon revealed the pitch-black night, and the giant-winged eagles soared above the quiet Yangtze River, circling over the deserted Qinglong Port. A gray small boat was spotted by us on the sea outside the port. Flares were dropped from the plane in order to identify whether it was a Chinese civilian boat or an enemy military boat. At high speed, the plane tilted and dived down to the surface of the Yangtze River. The engine suddenly exploded. When we desperately raised our heads to fly high, the plane was completely on fire in mid-air. The three of us in the front quickly jumped out of the window and were rescued by the local noble villagers, preserving our lives. The other eight brothers were tragically annihilated..."</p>
<p>This is an account by a distressed Allied pilot of the beginning and end of an Allied plane that crashed in Songji Port, northern Jiangsu, last June.</p>
<p>Visiting in the Rain Cannot Cool Down the Boiling Emotions</p>
<p>On a rainy day, June 16th, I was able to meet the three Allied pilots who crashed in Songji Port (which, like Qinglong Port, is a major commercial port in Haimen County, northern Jiangsu). At this time, my mood was suddenly agitated. To express my condolences, the dense rain could not cool down my boiling emotions, so I decided to visit them in the rain. I bought a basket of ripe, yellow loquats to serve as a gift of慰劳. I rolled up my trouser legs and walked along the muddy yellow dirt road towards my destination. After several interrogations along the way, I explained the reason and was allowed to pass. When I entered the house, it was crowded with people. In the crowd, I found the Allied pilots and also met Mr. E, an old classmate who was acting as a translator and had helped rescue the Allied pilots. One of the Allied pilots had an injury on his forehead, bandaged with gauze, and purple swelling around his eyes. The abrasions on his legs were covered with red medicine. They were all sitting or lying there blankly, silently. When we presented the loquats we had brought to them, smiles of gratitude appeared on their faces, and they slowly began to speak.</p>
<p>Allied Pilots Relate Their Backgrounds</p>
<p>The injured Allied pilot was the most willing to talk. He told me that he was from Okio, USA, named Darnil W. Redmon. His father was a lawyer with assets. He had five brothers, all of whom were serving the country. His mother therefore received an honorary medal. His older brother was killed in action during the recapture of the Philippines. He is 21 years old and, after graduating from aviation school, served in the air force as a pilot with the rank of lieutenant. He has been serving the country, the world, and all mankind for three years. The other two Allied friends remained silent as if they had infinite worries in their hearts. We only know that one was called Alber t L. Garuto, a telegraph operator, and the other was called Mawin R. Nester, a mechanic, who graduated from Washington High School and then entered aviation school for training.</p>

<p>(Top) Telegraph Operator Garuto, (Middle) Mechanic Nester, (Bottom) Pilot Redmon.</p>
<p>Flying from the Philippines - Carrying Rubber Boats and Parachutes</p>
<p>Redmon recounted that after they landed, they hid in the reeds in a dry small river for several hours. The next day, before dawn, they ran around, unable to find their way in the fields. Later, with the guidance of the villagers, they carried him (the injured pilot, who was unable to move at the time) on their backs and hid in the local puppet township office (the township chief's conscience was not completely dead). The enemy soldiers searched severely. They suffocated in the villagers' wood shed. To avoid the eyes of the public, they moved to Mr. E's home and then tried to escort them here. Redmon expressed his infinite gratitude to the villagers and regarded his own experience as an extraordinary adventure.</p>
<p>"How long does it take you to fly from the Philippines to here?"</p>
<p>"The plane can fly for 40 hours with a full tank of fuel. It takes about 28 hours to fly back and forth from the Philippines to here (suspected error or memory lapse), so we have 12 hours to complete our mission calmly."</p>
<p>"What kind of weapons are equipped on the plane?"</p>
<p>"In addition to the various necessary equipment on the plane, there is also a small gun, two heavy machine guns, eight light machine guns, and bombs..."</p>
<p>"The rubber boat and parachute that we carried when we jumped down... the villagers helped me destroy them..." He added this sentence.</p>
<p>After speaking, he showed us the passports issued to them by the Chinese Aviation Committee, as well as a small Chinese-English conversation translation booklet, blood type copper medals, American matches... and explained them in a low voice.</p>
<h3>Bloodstains and Bullet Holes on Guanyin Mountain - Real Record of Following Troops on Patrol</h3>
<p>— Correspondence from Nantong, 14th of the Month, Canling</p>
<p>Several days ago, I had a plan to see the scene of the Guanyin Mountain (Xiaohai Guanyin) battlefield after the devastation of artillery fire, but I could not go alone, nor could many people go. If there were no armed comrades accompanying me, although people might not want to harm you, some people often die unexpectedly, and I had no opportunity, and as time passed, I forgot about it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an opportunity came. I heard that the National Army's X Company was ordered to patrol the Guanyin Mountain area. I got this good news and rushed to the company headquarters to discuss it with Company Commander Li, and I was allowed to go with them. The winding queue, under the warm sunshine, advanced along the seaside on the flat road. Company Commander Li wanted to give me a bicycle, but I said, "I can run, it's better to walk together."</p>
<p>Walking Step by Step in the Wheat Waves Like Green Gauze</p>
<p>The green-yellow wheat stalks can no longer support the soon-to-be-ripe ears of wheat, and they all bowed their heads. The waves of wheat awns in the breeze are like ripples of green gauze.</p>
<p>Because of the height of the wheat field, the troops feared another sudden sneak attack, and Company Commander Li ordered the brothers to put their guns on their shoulders, load their bullets, and pay attention to the targets on the roofs of the surrounding villages. The brothers were all high-spirited, talking about their combat experiences, and laughing from time to time, but their eyes were always focused on the front.</p>
<p>After walking four li and crossing three bridges, Li Yingchang pointed to a wheat field with wheat stalks falling and told me that this was the artillery position where the National Army reinforced Guanyin in an emergency. Along the way, he told me about the battle formations of the communist troops. As he spoke, he pointed to which village house was a stronghold of the National Army and which village house was a stronghold of the communist troops. He described how the communist troops surrounded them, how they captured the strongholds of the communist troops, and finally how they mutually covered their retreat because of the fierce artillery fire of the communist troops. He also pointed to many corpse pits along the road, which were those of the National Army and which were those of the communist troops. On the wheat stalks, on the grass, the mottled bloodstains had been burned into a scorched black color by the sun. The marching brothers, seeing many corpse pits and bloodstains, told many heroic stories.</p>
<p>The Taiping Temple Is Not Peaceful - Even the Bodhisattvas Suffer</p>
<p>Arriving at Guanyin Mountain, it was the battlefield. The National Army's stronghold was Taiping Temple. Taiping Temple is located half a li south of Guanhe Town. It is a quiet and elegant place surrounded by water on three sides and shaded by greenery. I clearly remember that a year ago, when I came to the city from my hometown, Taiping Temple was an old-fashioned temple with red walls and white walls, but now, after the enemy surrendered with bent knees, the Taiping Temple is not peaceful. After a day and night of artillery bombardment, only a few broken trunks and rafters remained, looking like a wooden cage supported by collapsed walls and ruins. Only three or five clay Buddha statues remained. Several towering ginkgo trees, one with a broken branch, a bald, withered top, and one knocked down into the river, leaving only two still with green shade, reflecting the afterglow after the catastrophe. Taiping Temple originally had a primary school, with more than 20 rooms. Fortunately, the three small houses next to the west bank of the river and a pavilion in the southwest corner were safe and sound. An old couple lived in the house. When the old woman saw us, before we could open our mouths to ask, she told me: These days, militiamen have been coming every day to dismantle the walls, saying that they want to take all these wooden materials away. I begged them again and again not to dismantle them, but the militiamen slapped me several times, saying that I was begging them not to dismantle the house because I wanted to leave it for the National Army to live in again. Now, even the three small houses I live in are going to be dismantled, so it's a pity that my old couple can't live here anymore! "As she said this, tears kept flowing.</p>
<p>Military Hats and Uniforms Are Moldering - Corpses Turn into Fertilizer</p>
<p>In front of the small house, there is a new pile of loose soil. She also told me: "The corpses of the National Army are buried here. On the 27th, the New Fourth Army rushed in, turned over the loose mud, dragged out the corpses of the National Army, completely stripped off the clothes on the corpses, and then buried them inside."</p>
<p>In the northwest corner of Taiping Temple, there is a large graveyard, which is one of the positions where the communist troops besieged the National Army. Now there are many more corpse pits on it. The legs and heads of these corpse pits are still exposed outside the soil. Countless maggots wriggle on the corpses, and the stench is unbearable. On the fresh soil, green grass grows vigorously. The rotten corpses are just the fertilizer for the green grass. Piles of green grass, by the river, in the wheat fields, there are scattered gray military uniforms and military hats that are moldering. Under a ginkgo tree, there is a large tomb of the National Army. I stood by the tomb and paid my respects for a while, and couldn't help but feel sad.</p>
<p>Nine Out of Ten Households Are Closed and Empty - The Market Is Desolate</p>
<p>In the nearby wheat fields, on the tree trunks, on the roofs, and on the walls, there are traces of bullets, or large holes pierced by shells. The doors of the farmers' houses are tightly closed, and not a single farmer can be seen running in the fields. Although the war has ended for more than ten days, this area is still filled with an atmosphere of terror, misery, and cruelty. On Guanhe Town, the market is deserted and desolate, nine out of ten households are closed, and nine out of ten rooms are empty. Only two iron shops are banging away, and there is a raging fire in the furnace. There is not a single pedestrian. I took a break in the town for a moment.</p>
<p>According to an old man who is nearly sixty years old, when the communist troops came to attack Taiping Temple, many were killed by the National Army every night. They were recruited at any time and transported away by boat with sweet potato heads. They only knew that the communist troops suffered heavy casualties, but they did not know how many. On the morning of the 27th, the communist troops went to the countryside to dismantle the doors and windows of the old people's houses, pulled laborers, removed fences and cloths to carry the wounded soldiers. At night, they opened the doors of the old people's houses in the town, threatened them with bayonets, and forced them to tell who in the town was related to the National Army. At the same time, they took away quilts, shoes, socks, and cigarettes. The people of the whole town slept on the ground wrapped in quilts in a hail of bullets, and no one dared to say a word. Now the young people in the town have all fled to the city, and some have hidden in the homes of distant relatives. Fortunately, not many old people were killed or injured, which is really lucky! "As the old man said this, a comforting smile appeared on his face.</p>
<p>It was already twelve o'clock. After viewing the battlefield for about forty minutes, the long line of people followed the original route and returned to Tongcheng at one o'clock.</p>
<h3>One Bath at Huangxi Creek</h3>
<p>— By Air Mail from Taiwan, 12th – Meichun</p>
<p>Mount Datun, towering 450 meters above sea level, stands majestically to the north of Taiwan Province. It is not part of the central mountain range, the "spine of Taiwan," but extends from Japan through the Ryukyu Islands, reaching Taiwan and then Penghu. It is the only volcano on the island, and traces of the old crater of Xiaoguanyin Mountain still remain.</p>
<p>Hot springs are found almost everywhere on the island. Within Taipei County alone, there are Beitou, Caoshan, Shengmu, Jinshan, Wulai, Yilan, and other hot springs. Mount Datun is surrounded by these hot springs on all sides.</p>
<p>The Datun Mountain range, composed of Qixing Mountain, Datun Mountain, Shamao Mountain, Zhuzi Mountain, Mian Tian Mountain, Caigongkeng Mountain, and Xiaoguanyin Mountain, presents its magnificent form clearly from the streets of Taipei. On clear mornings, mist pervades, lightly veiling it like a thin gauze. On cloudy afternoons, the peaks are distinct, even the trees are clearly visible. Before rain, it appears dark and hazy like dense clouds. At dawn and dusk, the dim rain offers travelers endless alluring charm. Beitou, known as the "gentle village," lies beside it. My long-awaited dream has finally come true as I lie in its embrace, spending a precious holiday.</p>
<p>Various Hot Springs – Can Cure Hundreds of Human Ailments</p>
<p>Beitou is surrounded on three sides by Mount Datun, Qixing, and Shamao Mountains. It was once a sulfur-producing area. The hot springs were discovered in the late Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. There are three types of hot spring water: 1. Iron-containing simple earth type, 59 degrees Celsius, can treat neuralgia, rheumatism, gastritis, pharyngitis, tracheitis, hemorrhoids, malignant tumors, and diabetes. 2. Alum spring, acidic alum spring, 86 degrees Celsius, can treat chronic skin diseases, ulcers, and glandular diseases. 3. Radium spring, containing radium emanation, can treat gout, internal use can treat catarrh, rheumatism, and restore energy. From Taipei City, it takes 30 minutes by car or 40 minutes by train to reach Beitou. There are many hot spring locations, some are far away, some do not know which transport to use, and some friends have not been there and do not know how to get there. Although it is known that Caoshan Hot Springs is located in the valleys of Qixing and Shamao Mountains, it is a sulfur spring, 71 degrees Celsius, can treat leucorrhea, skin diseases, rheumatism, gout, glandular diseases, and women's diseases. When the peach blossoms bloom in February, it is the most attractive time. Taking a suburban bus is quite convenient, but now there are few tourists, and it has reached a desolate season. Shengmu Hot Springs is located in Sanjiaopu, Shilin Street, containing carbonic acid water and green alum spring, 45-52 degrees Celsius, can treat anemia, women's diseases, and nervous system diseases. Because there is no regular bus service, it does not attract much attention. Other hot springs are slightly further from Taipei City, which limits the footsteps of tourists.</p>
<p>There is a railway branch line between Taipei and Tamsui, with sixteen trains running up and down daily. Beitou is one of the stations. My wife and I took our child on a rather crowded silver-colored bus and got off in front of Taipei Station. We hurriedly walked inside. The station was orderly and clean inside and out, a complete change from the past chaotic scene. We bought two tickets for four Taiwan dollars each. The 10:20 train was still half an hour away, so we waited behind the other passengers. We quietly waited for the female ticket inspector to open the gate and punch the tickets. After entering the platform, everyone walked quickly across a rather long overpass, and followed the male and female passengers into the empty train parked on the north side. The tracks were narrow and the cars were small. Some seats had cushions, but they were mostly worn out, mostly just skeletal wooden slats. Fortunately, we managed to get seats. The fact that the carriages were not connected was also a unique feature. An old man selling newspapers, a child selling popsicles, and a young woman carrying a load of chicken cakes came in to sell, adding color to the crowd. Unlike other provinces, people selling things on the train did not shout loudly. Seeing people selling newspapers while holding them in their hands was a first for me since arriving in Taiwan. There was none of the tension and competition among newspaper vendors shouting and walking around as in Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Leaving the City – New Rice Harvest in Tainan</p>
<p>The first stop, Dazheng Street, has been abandoned and no longer in use. After a brief stop at Shuanglian, we gradually left the city. Flowers and trees grew luxuriantly, and the fields were like a green carpet. Farmers were bent over weeding. Tainan had already harvested its new rice, and the scorching heat had taken over the entire island. After crossing the Yuanshan and the Keelung River, we traveled entirely through the countryside, beside the mountains and along the water. The clear mountain air was a dark green, and the green trees provided shade. Fishing boats floated in groups of three or five on the Tamsui River. The open countryside was dotted with red-tiled houses, making one feel as if one were on the banks of the Miluo River or living in Guilin Province. Such dreams are futile, having long become memories. Who would know that this scene and this feeling are on the beautiful island suspended overseas? Shilin is a small town with passengers getting on and off. The station names on the Taiwan railway are arranged from left to right. When we arrived at Hooli’an, I continued with the old habit and said "Anliziqi", my wife said it was "Hooli’an", and we both laughed for a while. Almost half of the passengers got off at Beitou, all coming to rest at the hot springs during the holidays.</p>
<p>The so-called Beitou Hot Springs are in Xinbeitou and Dingbeitou. There used to be a railway branch line, which was dismantled by the Japanese during the war when they were scraping together everything they could find. Following my lover, we walked through the streets of Beitou, a small town similar to Xikou in Fenghua. After walking about two li, among fragrant flowers and plants, and scattered residences, we crossed a cement bridge, which marked the entrance to the mountains. Hot spring hotels were built on the mountainside, rising and falling with the terrain, hidden among the green trees. The road wound its way up, looking like a white ribbon from afar. The mountains were covered with flowers and trees, and the gardens were evergreen. Along the way, there were ponds, pavilions, bridges, seats, and tea rooms, allowing travelers to enjoy themselves in any way they pleased. Hot springs surged and crashed against jagged, grotesque rocks, creating a gurgling sound. The splashing spray looked like silver flowers. The places where sulfur water flowed were covered with yellow crystals. In Beitou Street, there were also shops selling sulfur flowers and sulfur oil. Where alum springs flowed, the pebbles in the water were dyed a lovely green color.</p>
<p>Hot Spring Hotels – Divided into Male and Female Sections</p>
<p>The hot springs in the hotels are piped in through terracotta pipes and stored in pools. Cold water is available nearby for bathers to adjust the temperature. It is said that fish can survive where the hot springs flow, but people dare not reach in because it is too hot. However, it would be convenient for scalding chicken feathers or boiling eggs. The government-run public bathhouses are quite elaborate, while the privately owned ones are rather simple. They are divided into male and female sections, separated by a wall, so you cannot see or reach the other side. It is said that they are not purely Japanese-style. Bathing in Taiwan is not as leisurely and carefree as in Yangzhou or Zhenjiang. It is simply washing oneself. Bathing costs only one Taiwan dollar. The pool water cannot be used to soak a completely dirty body. You can only use a wooden basin to hold water and wash again and again, hot or cold, as you please. The names of the hotels have been changed to appeal to Chinese people, but the interiors are still Japanese-style. First-class rooms cost twenty-five Taiwan dollars per person, with young women serving tea. Besides bathing, they are of course for guests to stay in. The Japanese have all returned to their country, and the hotels are now leased and operated by Taiwanese from the county government. After securing a room at the Yueming Hotel, we sat on chairs, sipping Taiwan-produced black tea, and gazing at the mountains and fields. It was peaceful and quiet, evoking the line "stealing half a day of leisure from a busy life" and celebrating my own carefree mood. A bathing picture hung in the corner of the room, depicting a woman scrubbing a man's back, no different from an advertisement. People who come to Beitou often say that you can find women to wash you at night. A certain gentleman who came to Beitou to bathe two months ago was surprised when a Japanese girl opened the door and bathed with him. He felt a little embarrassed, but she washed herself and left without a care.</p>
<p>Decayed and Desolate – The Beauty Cannot Be Denied</p>
<p>The hot spring bath had a slight sulfur smell. After washing, I rinsed my body with cold water and felt indescribably refreshed.</p>
<p>People who come to Beitou either rest in the hotels, lie in the woods, or sit by the stream, blankly watching the water flow. After bathing, we walked and played on the gravel path in the mountains, seeing the wreckage of Japanese kamikaze planes, some unused air-raid shelters, a desolate racecourse, and electric poles that had lost their light bulbs. In the quiet mountains, there was a faint chirping of birds. This former "Datun National Park" is now somewhat decayed and desolate, but its beauty cannot be denied – quietly revealing its spring charm.</p>
<p>On the way back, we took a shuttle bus and drove quickly on the asphalt road. After passing the Zhongshan Bridge, the beautiful scenery of Jiantan and Huguo Temple disappeared into the dense forest, and we returned to the city.</p>
<p>Signing for Remembrance – and Hoping for a Future Meeting</p>
<p>Time chased away the daylight, and we had to leave, allowing them to rest. Before leaving, we asked each of them to sign their names as a memento.</p>
<p>The next day, the sky cleared. The reporter set off for home. On the way through a certain town, a notice from the Japanese Army Department was posted high on the wall:</p>
<p>"On June 14th, an American plane crashed in Songji Harbor. Two American pilots escaped (they only knew of two). Whoever captures them and sends them to the department will receive a reward of one million yuan per person..."</p>
<p>It was the season for loquats to ripen again. I wondered if they had reached their homeland and were in the embrace of their loved ones. I wished them well: may they always be safe, and I hoped for a "future meeting."</p>
<p>Scientific Linguistics</p>
<h3>Gospel for the Deaf – Listening to Speeches – and Hearing Songs</h3>
<p>Can deaf people listen to speeches? In today's scientifically all-powerful America, it is possible.</p>
<p>A new American invention allows deaf people to listen to speeches by famous people. When anyone gives a speech at a podium, the sound waves pass through a special device, which reflects various symbols on a screen, making them clear to the deaf at a glance. This is like quenching thirst with plums, a consolation better than nothing.</p>
<p>According to the inventor, Bell Telephone Company, this device can not only transmit speeches, but also introduce songs to deaf people through symbols. Symbols replacing songs may be comparable to a wife of plums and a son of cranes, but they may not be able to satisfy the "musical desires" of the deaf. Details can be found in the pictures published here.</p>
<p>According to a news dispatch from the British Information Service in London on the 20th, "A new hearing aid invention has recently been exhibited here, as ingenious as a cigarette case, three inches long, two inches wide, and one inch high, equipped with three loudspeaker pistons, an earpiece, and several dry batteries, consuming less than one penny per hour.</p>
<p>During the exhibition, a severely hard-of-hearing person wore it for testing. It is said that everything could be heard clearly.</p>
<p>This new invention is the work of the London Research Institute of the British Post Office and will likely be adopted for new health services nationwide in the UK. Dr. Randell, Director of the Research Institute, said, "This successful experimental model is comparable to the latest British and American hearing aids, and its diagnostic effect is even superior to all others."

<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3>A Gain from Production</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ming</p>
<p>Not far from my home, there is a temple, where several monks and incense workers live. The cost of living has risen to an extreme point, and their business is quiet to an extreme point. Because a Buddhist service costs tens of thousands of dollars, which is not like daily necessities, so everyone saves as much as they can. The monks have nothing to do, and the incense workers also have nothing to do, but they can't just put aside their eating and drinking like blue chimes and red fish.</p>
<p>In order to make a living, they had to use their brains. So, they cleaned up a few monks' rooms and rented them out, which provided them with rental income. There were two acres of wasteland in the backyard, which had always been abandoned. Recently, they mobilized all the monks and incense workers to loosen the soil on a portion of the land, fertilize it, and plant green vegetables and amaranth. In just a few weeks, the gray-brown soil was covered with tender green vegetables. The wasteland was transformed into fertile land, not only providing them with side dishes, but also allowing them to sell the remainder to others in exchange for some food.</p>
<p>When they were plowing and fertilizing the land, I took some time to visit. During a break, we chatted and talked about how most of the tools they used were borrowed, but adding hoes, buckets, and other items cost them tens of thousands of dollars. After the seeds were sown and a little fertilizer was applied, they grew day by day. Because there was a lot of rain this year, the work of watering was greatly reduced, but the first harvest could only offset the cost of the tools. I saw smiles on their faces as they worked and sweated, and the vegetables on the large green field reflected their inner comfort.</p>
<p>I strolled through the green fields, and from my relaxed steps, I realized that production is not just empty talk, but the crystallization of strength and sweat. As the sun set, I bought two catties of amaranth to take home, and when I ate it with noodles, it tasted especially delicious.</p>
<p>Society</p>
<h3>Panda</h3>
<p>— Xu Yulin</p>
<p>The British treasured the panda that China gifted them and specially transported it back by plane. Foreigners consider it lucky and glorious to obtain a rare Chinese panda. However, while the world cherishes this small animal, even though it originates in China, the Chinese people do not attach importance to their own glorious specialty, the panda, and do not feel as interested as foreigners.</p>
<p>Currently, many things in the country share the same fate as the panda. The Chinese people have a cold attitude towards the affairs of their homeland. For example, there is a panic about food shortages in various places. Foreigners who have not suffered from hunger are loudly calling out for us, while the people of this country, besides the compatriots who are suffering from the disaster and crying for help, the other compatriots who are living more affluent lives are holding a nonchalant attitude. It seems that this is not the suffering of the homeland. No wonder foreigners use the headline "China is starving, Shanghai is dancing" to publish the situation in China.</p>
<p>My compatriots lack a sense of national identity. Foreigners are worrying about some things for us, while we ourselves do not care. This not only makes other countries look down on us, but also makes us lose face. I hope that in the future, compatriots will pay attention to the affairs of the homeland, whether they are painful or happy, so that foreigners will no longer have to care about the affairs of our country.</p>
<h3>One Word Can Revive a Nation</h3>
<p>— Langhuan</p>
<p>Napoleon once asked Madame Campan, "What do we need to make the youth of France excellent and France strong?"</p>
<p>Madame Campan replied, "Wise mothers."</p>
<p>Napoleon greatly praised her, saying, "People say 'one word can revive a nation,' and your words truly deserve that praise."</p>
<h3>Deposit</h3>
<p>— A Dong</p>
<p>The humorist George Bernard Shaw recently made another witty remark. He said that he advised all women to ask their husbands for a 500-pound deposit each time they want to have a child. This would definitely prevent the panic of overpopulation. Being a mother can reduce a lot of hardship, and children can also become more excellent.</p>
<h3>Words on the Wall</h3>
<p>— Xue Ji</p>
<p>On the walls of the Bethany Orphanage in this city, there are many vivid slogans, all personally written by the director, Mr. Qian Tuanyun. I am copying them down below for everyone to enjoy:</p>
<p>Faith becomes strength, action creates omnipotence.</p>
<p>Winning a person with words, losing a person's heart.</p>
<p>When you receive kindness, you should repay it. Diligence and thrift can build a home.</p>
<p>Give to others without hesitation, receive from others without being casual.</p>
<p>Labor strengthens the body, wealth lies in diligence.</p>
<p>Be content with yourself, work hard.</p>
<p>There is truth in silence, reading can cultivate righteousness.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of hardship, embrace hardship.</p>
<p>Research is the key to success.</p>
<p>Working and eating are good men, playing and eating are bad eggs.</p>

<h3>Gymnastics on the Tram</h3>
<p>— Sheng Shan Jiong</p>
<p>This has almost become my habit. Every morning after getting up, I spend a quarter of an hour doing various freehand exercises. In this way, my small and weak body has unconsciously become stronger. I can't talk about developed muscles yet, but my spirit is refreshed, and my physical strength has surpassed that of ordinary people. And it reduces many common diseases. Gymnastics has been too beneficial for me, making me feel grateful and respectful towards it.</p>
<p>One day, because of some family matters, I went to bed too late, so I got up very late the next day and rushed out of the house. Usually, I walk to school, but that day, due to time constraints, I had to take the tram. The station was already full of people, lined up in a long snake shape. I also joined the line, like an army waiting to depart. One car, two cars, all crowded with people, drove away. It was hard to squeeze into the third car. Of course, I couldn't enjoy a seat. I held on to the horizontal bar with both hands. Later, the engine started to vibrate, and I held my hands even tighter. The road was uneven, and the car moved up and down. I lifted my heels and touched the ground with my toes, which reduced the strong vibration. I remembered: This is the exercise for the arms and feet.</p>
<p>After a few stops, the car was already full of people, almost unable to move. The force from behind was too strong. At this time, my hands were hanging on the wooden bar, and my feet could not move, so I had to push my stomach forward. But the later passengers were all ambitious and took an inch after getting a foot. My stomach really couldn't go any further, and there was a risk of my body being broken into two pieces. I had no choice but to use my butt to attack, spending a lot of effort to stabilize my body. But as soon as the car started, my body leaned to the left; when the car braked, my body leaned to the right. If there was no resistance, there was a high possibility of being scolded. This is the exercise for the buttocks and waist.</p>
<p>Later, the car really couldn't hold any more people. After passing small stations, if no one got off, the car wouldn't stop. I thought that this would be fine, but actually, it was the time for trouble. The one on the right looked like an old bookkeeper and started coughing, but didn't cover his mouth with a handkerchief. In order to avoid infection, I turned my head to the left. But the one on the left looked like a laborer and had bad breath, and he liked to speak loudly. How could I bear the bursts of strange fragrance, forcing me to turn my head back. The coughing stopped and the bad breath came, the bad breath stopped and the coughing came, but my head was busy, turning left and right, which was a very suitable head exercise.</p>
<p>Before long, I arrived at my destination. I started to stir, pushing into the gaps, squeezed out of the car, and walked to school. In the corridor, I saw the students were laughing and talking, knowing that class hadn't started yet. Recalling the feeling of being squeezed breathless in the car, I breathed out a few breaths. This was the deep breathing after the end of the exercise.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I didn't forget the exercise, but it wasn't at home, but in the car.</p>

<h3>Dot Warfare</h3>
<p>— Dejian</p>
<p>The tools used by spies to transmit messages were originally quite ingenious. But up to this Great War, it can be said that they have become exceptionally ingenious. The inventor of dot warfare was Professor Cai Po of the Higher Technical School in Dresden, Germany. His method involves first writing a document on a square piece of paper, then using a high-reduction camera to photograph it, reducing it to the size of a postage stamp. This image is then viewed through an inverted microscope, leaving a very small black dot on the film. Next, a chemical adhesive is applied, and a hypodermic needle, with its tip cut off and rounded, is pressed onto the black dot. The black dot is then detached from the film. After this black dot is inseparably embedded into the paper's fibers, the fibers are covered again. The result is no different from a black dot produced by a typewriter. The method is excellent, and the thought process is deep. Thus, seemingly ordinary love letters, family letters, and business letters, sent from North and South America to various countries, are actually filled with black dots. People are unaware, and messages leak out.</p>
<p>The U.S. Military Intelligence Agency (MIA) learned of the emergence of dot warfare from a man named [omitted], who was sent to Hamburg by the MIA and graduated from a Nazi detective school. He returned home in January 1940. According to his report, at the graduation farewell, the school principal, Dr. Xi Bao, told them: "Our message transmission network in the United States will never be obstructed. This is thanks to the application of the dot method." There was a hint of arrogance in his words. However, he did not elaborate on how it was used. Therefore, the American detective community developed a profound suspicion about the dots, and could only try their best to watch for proof. Nazi magic tools, in various forms, looked like safety matches, but were actually pencils that could write invisible words, which could be revealed with chemicals. Also, a list of Nazi leaders in America was found on a handkerchief in the hands of a worker, and a diagram of a submarine was dyed into the heel of a leather shoe. All of these things were discovered without omission. But the mystery of the dots remained unsolved.</p>
<p>In August 1941, a young traveler who had just arrived in America from the Balkans, with extravagant manners, seemed like a wealthy young man. When searching his luggage portfolio, the search personnel only felt a strange reflection of light as sunlight shone on an envelope. Upon closer examination, they realized that the black dot on the letter was suspicious. Placed under a 200x microscope, after inspection, they suddenly discovered the following passage: "The United States is currently using gas to conduct research on atomic energy and is eager to obtain experimental reports on this subject. Furthermore: (1) How is the heavy [object omitted] moved? (2) Where is this experiment being conducted? (School or factory?) (3) Are other raw materials needed?" In his pocket, they also found four blank telegraph forms with eleven black dots and a narrow strip of film. This film, stuck to the back of a stamp, had an image of a document filling twenty-five typed pages, mainly instructing to investigate the details of atomic energy, the monthly production of aircraft, and the number transported to England, Canada, and other places, as well as the training speed of pilots. Thus, the use of dots became completely clear. And the Nazi message transmission network was rendered ineffective. Japan also used dots to transmit messages from Tokyo to naval attachés stationed in the United States. In February 1942, over ninety letters were detained by the United States because of this. Once this method is exposed, it will naturally become ineffective. But one cannot assume that those engaged in espionage activities will stop their tricks because of this. With innovations emerging daily, let us wait and see!</p>

<h3>Thinking Like This</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhidao</p>
<p>Education first, whose responsibility does education rest on? — Teachers, especially university professors, naturally bear a greater responsibility, but their lives are not as good as workers, and they cannot carry the burden on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>When I am in class, whenever I see several professors with worried expressions, I think like this: if their level of scholarship is still like this, then the future prospects of us younger generations are even more unimaginable!</p>
<p>Teachers worry about their livelihoods, and students worry about their futures. How can academic studies not be compromised? Will the level of education improve or decline? When will the slogan "Education First" truly make education reach the first rank?</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Childhood</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The former U.S. President Roosevelt, who passed away on April 12th last year, had an ordinary childhood. As his mother said, in Roosevelt's early years, he was really no different from other children. His parents never dreamed that he would later become president. His parents' hopes for Roosevelt's future were simply that he would grow up to be like his father, upright, prudent, just, and kind, an American with "backbone."</p>
<p>Roosevelt was an only child. When his mother gave birth to him, due to a difficult labor, a large amount of "chloroform" was used, almost causing the death of both mother and child. Later, doctors and his relatives all thought he would not live long. No one could have imagined that he would serve four terms as President of the United States. His family circumstances can be said to have been very good, living in a village near the Hudson River in the United States. His daily life was patterned and orderly, usually getting up at seven, having breakfast at eight, studying at home from nine to twelve, and after finishing his homework, going outside to run around or play for a while. He had lunch at one in the afternoon, then took a walk and read until four. After four o'clock, he could do whatever sports and games he loved at any time. Because he was an only child, he often played alone. He loved running, playing ball, and especially riding horses. When he grew a little bigger, he could ride to the Dutch County, which surprised and praised many relatives and friends.</p>
<p>From a very young age, he developed a great interest in and love for shooting. When he was eleven years old, he received a shotgun from his father, and as a result, he gained a reputation as a skilled shooter among his many companions. At that time, he intended to establish a small museum in his own home, containing specimens of various birds from the Hudson River, all of which he had shot down himself. Soon, the redwood cabinet in his study was full of various specimens, including orioles, [omitted], robins, woodpeckers, and even an eagle.</p>
<p>Roosevelt also had a habit of ordering his companions around him in his childhood, for reasons that others could not imagine. One day, when he was ordering people around again, his mother said to him:</p>
<p>"Child, don't you always order others around, and let other children give orders too."</p>
<p>"Mom! If I don't give orders, then nothing will be done properly," he said without guile.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that he had the ability to lead and command others from a young age.</p>
<p>He learned many good hobbies from his father, such as collecting stamps, which also gave him a lot of geographical knowledge.</p>
<p>One evening, while he was sorting and pasting stamps, his mother was reading aloud to him, but he did not seem to be paying much attention. His mother put down the book and asked him:</p>
<p>"I don't think you heard a single word I was reading, right?"</p>
<p>Roosevelt immediately looked up, and a strange smile appeared on his face. He was able to recite the entire passage his mother had just read.</p>
<p>Essays</p>
<h3>The Character "Integrity" Has a Heart</h3>
<p>— Yu Ti</p>
<p>I remember in the "Liaozhai Zhiyi," there is a story called "Three-Dynasty Veteran," which uses the couplet "Filial piety, fraternal love, loyalty, trust, propriety, righteousness, integrity; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven" to scold Zhao Mengfu, a Song Dynasty official who served the enemy, for his "shamelessness" and "forgetfulness of honor."</p>
<p>Originally, "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of a nation; if the four pillars are not upheld, the nation will perish!"</p>
<p>Not long ago, I read an article on *Freedom Forum* by a gentleman titled "Heartless Integrity," saying that "the character 'integrity' has no heart." However, last night, as I walked near the 24th floor, I looked up and saw that the neon lights for the four characters "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame" were complete and intact, and I felt a burst of joy in my heart.</p>
<p>I hope that from now on, all public servants of the people can be clean and self-disciplined, so that the four characters "Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame" that we admire will no longer be discounted.</p>
<h3>Brewing Famine in Fujian and Guangdong</h3>
<p>— Lu Ming</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, according to reports from various sources, severe droughts have occurred in Fujian, Guangdong, and other places. Especially in southern Fujian and eastern Guangdong, the scorching sun has been blazing overhead for days, and everywhere is filled with a burning heat. This phenomenon is indeed rare in recent years. Most of the spring fields have been unable to be sown due to the lack of rain. Even the fields with relatively good irrigation facilities have barely been able to transplant rice seedlings, which have now been scorched by the sun. The climate has become very dry, and the farmers in the paddy fields are extremely uneasy about this. Grain prices have soared, and the brewing of this drought is becoming more and more serious day by day.</p>
<p>Anyone who can slightly understand the situation in rural areas will feel that the threat of this year's severe drought has reached a serious level. Farmers are struggling in hardship, working day and night, relying on meager human power, digging ditches and wells to draw water. However, this kind of hard work cannot last. The water sources are gradually drying up, and many wells are showing mud at the bottom. If it does not rain again in half a month, the fields will all be scorched. If spring cannot be cultivated, a food shortage will immediately occur in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Today, after being washed by war, conscription, and taxation, China's rural areas generally show signs of bankruptcy. And what follows facing the people are natural disasters and epidemics. In a country like China, with backward science, the post-war production rate and consumption rate are already far apart, coupled with the imbalance of population and distribution, which has created a major reason for today's economic panic. Taking food alone, many provinces that have been occupied and recovered are weak in production and cannot support themselves, and must rely on provinces with relatively stable situations to provide relief. Guangdong province was able to barely maintain food during the war, but after the restoration of transportation after the war, other provinces gradually absorbed food from it, so the food in the province became tense. Such a food problem is originally universal in China and cannot be solved in a short time. We can only hope that the harvest in the second half of the year will be abundant, and that the provinces will harvest to make up for it. However, in reality, the post-war rehabilitation has not yet been completed due to various reasons, and the productivity of the liberated areas has not yet recovered. If these relatively stable provinces do not have a good harvest in the second half of the year, it will immediately affect the entire people's livelihood problem.</p>
<p>Now, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places are facing the onslaught of this panic. Especially in eastern Guangdong, which suffered a severe drought last year. The old wave has not subsided, and a new wave is rising, and the situation is a hundred times worse than in Fujian. In rural areas without scientific equipment, they can only desperately hope that "Heaven" will send rain. Regarding the occurrence of this severe drought, there are two results that can be inferred: one is that even if Heaven does not send rain again in half a month, the harvest in the second half of the year will become a problem; and the other is that if "Heaven" can send rain in the next few days, the harvest in the second half of the year will not only be delayed, but also, due to climate reasons, the harvest will only be seventy or eighty percent at most. When the upper and lower seasons are not connected, a great panic will inevitably be caused by the lack of food. Regarding these two points, we are still hoping that the former will not become a reality, while the latter seems to be unavoidable. This is the problem of the entire people's livelihood, and its impact may spread to other provinces, not just limited to Fujian or Guangdong. We cannot solely rely on foreign compassionate help and ignore the current crisis itself. In this year of widespread disasters in the world, even if the United States can transport aircraft-loaded rice and wheat to relieve China, it is like a drop in the bucket, which will not help the overall situation. A clear historical example is that in the late Ming Dynasty, the drought and famine in Yan'an, a corner of the country, affected the unrest in the whole country. The people were forced by life to become bandits, resulting in the chaos of Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, which eventually led to the overthrow of the Ming Dynasty. Now, the disasters in Fujian and Guangdong are not as serious as they were at that time, but we cannot but pay attention to them.</p>
<p>Of course, we should try to think positively and hope that the drought and famine will not come to pass. However, it is good if the disaster does not come to pass, but what if the disaster does come to pass? Aren't the many historical facts of popular uprisings caused by famine that lead to pain and chaos were cultivated like that? What's more, in today's China, the people have gone through eight years of unprecedented suffering, exhausted their material resources, financial resources, and spirit, and are now exhausted. If they encounter unexpected and violent blows in this hardship, and the government does not give proper treatment and help, what path to survival will the people take? One dare not guess!</p>
<p>Regarding this issue related to the overall people's livelihood, I believe that it does not belong to a single aspect, nor is it limited to Fujian and Guangdong provinces or the eastern Guangdong area. This must be solved from the entire root. How to stabilize the people's livelihood and how to eliminate the suffering of the people should be the center of the problem-solving. In these years, we would rather have more consideration to "store grain to prevent famine" than have less planning to "one day of sunshine followed by ten days of frost." Here, I ask the authorities to pay attention to it! (April 23, 35th year, in Fujian)</p>
