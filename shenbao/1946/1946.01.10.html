<h3>協商會議今晨揭幕蔣主席將親臨主持</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶九日電〕今日爲政治協商會議前夕，各方提案，經多日來準備，大致已告完成。政府代表於今日下午茶會，招待各方代表。陪都與論對於此會前途，多致深切希望，並勉各方代表，要摒棄私見，應以國家民族爲重。至於社會公團，亦多相繼開會，發表宣言，咸對共產黨一面提出無條件停止軍事衝突，一面在蘇北·冀東·魯南諸地，繼續軍事行動，頗爲不解。因此，三人小組會議在原則上雖已獲致同意，但在技術上，尚少具體辦法。依照共產黨條件，其所謂停止衝突，似含有保障其割據現狀之意味，而政府方面，則認必須在軍令統一之原則上，獲得澈底之執行，始有所成，此爲雙方不同之焦點。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶九日電〕今日爲政治協商會議揭幕前夕，陪都充滿緊張空氣，各方對此，均寄以最大期望。今日各黨代表在會外至爲活躍，一致希望此次會議能達到團結及民主化目的。明日出席代表三十八人，僅有極少數因病及不克趕到者外均將出席參加。大會秘書處對於旁聽之新聞記者辦法業經規定，入塲之外籍記者，均須先領草綠色入場證，證上註明姓名及報社，並規定不得携帶手槍或木杖，否則拒絕入場。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶九日電〕政治協商會議，十日晨十時，假國府禮堂開幕，蔣主席將親臨主持並致詞。政府爲結束訓政，還政於民，會於戰前依法辦理國民代表大會代表選舉，惟大部代表選出後，抗戰遂起，致大會無法召開。政府復於廿七年依據抗戰建國綱領，召開參政會，爲戰時全國民意機稱，贊與抗建，貢獻極鉅。茲者抗戰已獲勝利，政府爲謀和平建國，早日實施憲政，復召集各黨派代表及社會賢達，舉行政治協商會議，商討有關問題，會期雖僅二週，各方希望甚殷。</p>
<p>〔又電〕外記者招待會，九日午後三時舉行，由吳部長瞬楨，劉次長錯，及張參事平羣主持，茲錄主要問答如次：問：政治協商會議，明日開幕之程序如何？答：明日開幕，蔣主席親自主持並致詞，該會秘書長亦將有所報告。問：蔣特派員經國已返抵渝吾？答：蔣氏正在返渝途中。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶九日電〕政治協商會議定於明晨十時，在國府大禮堂開幕。出席代表三十八人，會期十四日。該會之成坊與否，將決定中國之新命運。開幕時將由蔣主席任議長，致開會詞，會議至午刻止，下午並不開會，新聞記者可以入塲，外國訪員每人發入塲證一紙，以便採訪新聞。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山九日廣播稱：下午報特派員自重慶來電稱：「懷具中國和平及繁榮希望之中國民衆，其目光均集中於重慶國民政府禮堂」。衆目睽睽之禮堂，較中型之跳舞廳略大，在過去數日中，工匠盡其心裁，俾將該會址形成中國歷史上永垂不朽之議會。此一禮堂乃蔣主席接見各國大使之所在，孫中山先生之遺像高懸其上，仁慈之目光，將注視參加之各代表。大會於十時展幕，由蔣主席致開會詞，須至十二時方可竣事，下午無會，眞正之討論將於翌日開始。</p>
<h3>停戰命令尙未發出各項細則待商討三人委員會續舉行五次會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社重慶九日電〕三人委員會企圖覓取中國內戰解決方案之舉，今晚已歸失敗。目前所希望「停戰」命令之發出，亦未實現。今晚五時至六時四十分之會談完畢後，政府代表張羣謂：「各項細則尚未解決，前途並不壞，但困難」！渠承認，明晚仍有希望解決一切懸案。其時「我人將復有所言」。當記者詢以是否尚有希望，時美特使馬歇爾答日：「嗄，當然！當然！」記者問有吾未嘗預見之困難？馬帥曰：「無」。記者復問以明日之會談，是否最後一次？馬帥謂：「難講」。當詢及政治協商會議開會前停戰命令如何時，渠指謂：政治協商會在上午十時開幕，三人會議則於下午五時復開。</p>
<p>（又電）今日馬歇爾元帥。張羣·周恩來等三人宣稱：已於一切要點上，獲得協議。三人委會會議於本日下午四時半始畢。昨晚七時，美駐華代辦勞勃生亦加入會談，該次會談爲三人會議舉行以來歷時最長之一次。昨晚馬帥本擬於七時半時與蘇駐華大使彼得羅夫同進晚餐，但遲至九時十分始行離會，渠步出此歷時悠長之會議塲所時，面露微笑，一若其他與會者然。馬帥拒絕發表任何聲明，周恩來謂，協議雖已獲得「停戰」之命令則仍未發出。其他解決之要點，包括恢復交通，曁遺送日軍返國等問題。周恩來發表口頭聲明謂：「各項問題之主要部份，已獲解決，但尚有若干細則，留待討論處理。」國軍在熱河省之行動，一時曾有若干方面之指摘，然政府當局堅持其立塲，以爲基於日軍投降後熱河省區爲盟國戰果之理由，國軍此舉，顯屬正當，政府方面聲稱：日軍投降前，熱河省內並無共軍蹤跡，國軍此舉，不能與其他地區相提並論，視爲敵對共軍之行爲。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山九日午夜廣播稱：馬歇爾張羣與周恩來今日下午舉行第四次會議，此第四次會議或即係最後一次會議，可於明晨（十日）八時前頒發，並組織機構，監視停戰命令之執行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶九日電〕三人調解委員會今日第四次開會，對於國共停止衝突，並未成立最後協定，會議將延至明日。停戰命令今日不下，則政治協商會議明日開幕前，停戰之希望，即歸打消。今日會後張羣告記者稱：「光景不壞，但問題困難。委員會任務未了，不能發表消息，談判將繼續進行。」記者問馬歡爾特使，是否仍抱希望，馬使答復肯定，謂「並未引起意外困難。」</p>
<h3>和衷共濟完成統一　粵省參議會提出五項主張　陪都人民團體促共黨覺悟</h3>

<p>〔中央社重慶八日電〕陪都各人民團體，八日舉行新年聯歡會，到一百八十五單位之代表四百餘人。全體一致熱烈通過大會對時局宣言，促共產黨應痛改前非，澈底覺悟。</p>

<h3>平津開始兌換偽鈔財部要員稱金融物價不致受影響　中央印製廠籌備在平開工</h3>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕昨爲平津區僞聯銀劵兌換法幣第一日，全市除中央銀行外，尚有十一家公私銀行及二銀號同時兌換。人民因兌換期尚有四月餘之久，皆不亟亟於兌換，故各行門前臺無擁擠現象，各行員皆感意外輕鬆。記者十時親至交民巷中行兌換處一視，見兌換者僅十餘人，多係商店店員，所持聯銀以五元。十元劵居多，因在物價步步上漲聲中，此種小鈔已逐漸失其支付工具之地位故也。聞平津兌換官方準備工作大致尚佳，由渝運來法幣小額百元券，有相當數量，不久滬上印製法幣亦即可源源遵海路運平，印製廠亦正籌備開工，鈔票來源或不成大問題。僞聯鈔兌換後所生之社會影響，殊值注意，今日財部要員語記者，法幣對僞聯鈔一比五比率公布後，平津市塲並無波動，今開始兌換，爲該旣定比率之實行，諒亦不致影響金融物價，惟據報紙評論及街談巷議，並不如此樂觀，蓋所謂小額面之法幣百圓劵在平已合聯鈔五〇〇元，最普通之日常生活支付工具，尚爲聯鈔百元券，今後聯鈔百元及十元劵日日因兌換而減少，則流通市面者，起碼爲五倍於前之法幣百元劵，其劵價金融非無影響。至僞聯合準備銀行發行準備流通情形，經記者探悉，其總行發行及分支行庫存，共發行一九〇〇億，以在河北尤其平津流通最多，山東次之，山西又次之，河南最少。以都市多於鄕村，其準備金計黄金十七萬兩及少數白銀，按時價計算，的佔其發行額十分之一。又訊，平津區爲僞準鈔兌換之第一期，冀。晋俟秩序安定後方能辦理。</p>

<p>徐州係古彭城，楚懷王曾自吁眙移都於此，是時項梁正戰章邯，破定陶，圍陽穀；秦增援反攻，楚師大敗，而梁死楚將項藉劉邦方有事陳留，乃引兵東下，楚移都而北，正是軍事政治上重整頺勢的積極措施。楚漢二年，項藉擊齊，劉邦出漢中，曾以諸侯之兵五十六萬，攻入彭城，置酒高會。項藉自率三萬衆，出魯之魚台至蕭縣，迂迴彭城，漢軍聞之戰敗績。入穀泗睢水而死者二十餘萬人，劉邦亦幾不免，據歷史記載說：會有大風　晦，楚軍亂，邦得逸去。</p>
<p>回顧七年前徐州大會戰，日寇亦自我右翼迁迴徐州，面包圍之，然共規模尚爲歷代戰史上未見。徐州於二十七年五月十九日淪陷，一大羣記者隨軍突圍，烽火餘影，猶在目前。記者重臨斯土，方下車站，惟見牛馬驢車，　　於黯淡的燈光下，大軍雲集，警衛森嚴，仍感此古戰塲之戰意逼人。滯徐數日，曾分訪各方，然以形色匆匆，僅能誌其印象。</p>
<p>目前津浦車　，徐州以北，仍不能通，然東至連雲，西去開封，日有客貨運輸，極爲正常。徐汴間且於元且開放特快車。臨棗支綫，修而復斷，臨炎據聞有新四軍八師之衆，詢以車運何日可越臨城而北，軍方路方，俱無表示。</p>
<p>津浦路原由津浦路局統一調運，日寇盤踞後，以曹老集爲界，北由滿鐵經營，南屬華中鐵道株式會社。我方接收時，亦根據華北華中兩系統分別進行。但爲管理便利計，將浦徐段延至徐州外揚旗，成立浦徐段管理處。徐州則徐州鐵路局，其轄區北至兗州，東至連雲，西及碭山以西之楊集。將來接收完竣，秩序完全恢復時，自需重行調整。　無淪如何，徐州仍將爲連結津浦隴海之樞紐，爲商貨散集之中心。瞻望和平建國前途，徐州無疑有其嶄新之任務。茲將戰前每年自徐運出農產，銷行京滬各地者，列舉如後（以噸爲單位）：</p>
<p>花生仁二四，〇〇〇　瓜子　一〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>黄豆二〇，〇〇〇　小麥一〇〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>金針菜六〇〇</p>
<p>至畜產方面，年有黃狼皮一萬張，牛皮八千担，羊皮五千担運至京滬。高粱酒一宗，則大都集中東海，船運靑島上海，根據東海統計，則年達八十萬担。徐州商運上之重要性，由此可見一般。</p>
<p>過去津浦綫貨運佔十分之七，客運佔十分之三。目前統計，貨運僅十分之三，此一數字，實爲地方生產秩序之指標。至於目前運轍力量，以浦徐段接收機車一百〇七輛論，已逾戰前所有之半。</p>
<p>日寇經營徐州，顯然以軍事控制經濟，榨取爲目的。記者對徐州市區建築，留有深刻印象，蓋馬路廣闊如南京，房屋多以鋼筋水泥築成，且多爲托齊卡式，槍眼密如蜂窠，戰意盈然。與戲馬台一帶古老樸質之舊市區對此，深感侵略主義者之巨大恐怖性也。其建設重點在交通，以加强其點的佔領，俾符軍事之需要。記者曾參觀子房山大隧道，中有自動人工千門電話總機兩座，二百五十基羅瓦無棧電台一座。另有鐵路醫院，佔地百畝，容病牀不下千數，與郊外另一野戰醫院媲美，其中設備，包括一完全之試驗室，可作各種生物化學試驗，院長日人橫田博士，刻仍留用。據語記者：渠正在培製盤尼亞靈，登雲龍山，可俯瞰徐州市區，營房櫛比，除東南西北四兵營外，復有市區兵營。察其建築，每兵營可納一個師團之衆。可注意者，即津浦路職員宿舍，其建築物之大小佈位，與營房同。登高望之，殊不易辨。</p>
<p>記者曾與一篤實商人閒談及此，彼議「那些日本小伙子倒還不錯，不抽烟，不喝酒，天天修屋造路。」意若光復之後，此等建築工程已告停止，而若干浮奢之新現象，又爲北方民性所不喜，記者聞之，深自戒懼。</p>
<p>蓋日寇公開表示之計劃，係以五十萬人口之都市建築爲目標，計劃第一期，在道路區劃之設定，已於前年結束，並進入第二期。前年人口，據日方統計達廿萬人，日僑一萬三千餘人。較諸廿七年，增三分之一，此實爲建築工程膨漲，大量勞力吸收有以致之。不少明智的人士，大聲疾呼：「不要光看表面，現在的徐州，正是中國老百姓的血和肉堆起來的！」</p>
<p>徐州建築物固甚多，但房荒仍感嚴重。究其原因，要在分配不勻，濫被佔用所致。徐州入城及過境部隊，番號甚多，各設通訊處式留守處，甚至其他名目，此或爲事實上所需要，但記者所見，每各名目單位，佔洋房一大楝，且有軍官私人，佔住洋房者，於門首標示，某某處長公館，並加蓋部隊番號關防。自綏靖主任顧祝同到達後，表示自軍以下，再不准留通訊處，但風紀之整飭，要在懲前毖後，當不自有無規定始也。由於軍隊須要營房，徐州遂成立營房分配委員會，以統籌房屋。舉凡敵偽佔用者，俱可調配，遂置民衆產權問題於其次，但民衆還鄕，探視其家園者，正自隴海錢上絡繹而來，彼等向各方奔走呼籲，尚未見有端倪。一般而論，徐州接收秩序，不如京滬等處，據聞海州又遠不如徐州。此等缺陷之發生，原因固甚複雜，但究不外事權，職責以及人事，蓋接收之際，不能適時機斷，事後補救，固未嫌遲，惟終屬遺憾耳。舉如銀行方面，迄未見有人員加以接收，僞幣收兌，亦未開始，如啓明路之朝鮮銀行大廈，不知係由何方接收者，現該廈為一不相干之機關所用。社會部之接收人員，來徐較遲，刻已無物可收，關於合作事業部份之物資，不知何往，且帳籍被燬，處理棘手。此類事象，僅反映全事象之一部，今後正風肅邪，任務正重，徐州係交通要塞，觀瞻所系，實宜積極國之。　日寇統治徐州區，標示所謂「蘇北行政獨立」初設僞蘇北行政專員公署，統轄蘇北廿二縣，旋改爲「淮海特別區行政公署」。日寇投降前，又改爲「淮海省」。易傀儡郝鵬爲郝鵬舉。此二人姓同名似，蘇北民衆有「以鵬易鵬，何必多此一舉」一語揶揄之，蓋此「獨立」之本質！實係滿鐵系財閥系特別控制之代稱。據聞徐州有大小工廠三十九家之多，多屬農產品加工性質。其中包括酒精，製粉，製油，皮革，肥皂，紗布，硝子，釀造！煉瓦等。當有未落成開工之酒精廠家在柳泉，此處可東往賈旺　即有著名之賈旺煤礦在，戰前曾年銷長江沿岸十五萬噸，現該礦產量則極微。至上述工廠，接收即停工現象亦似他處。據市長駱東藩語者：市府方面擬請當局將此等工廠，依其性質，分別由地方與中央經營。但詢以三十九廠具體情形，則徐州一般高級人員類不能道其詳，惟知閉門停工之後，其情况似不甚佳耳。</p>
<h3>滇省府將劃兩個軍區</h3>
<p>民政廳長有易人說</p>
<p>〔太報昆明九日電〕滇省將劃爲兩個軍區，據聞司令人選以金漢鼎。阮肇慶呼聲最高。滇警務處已改組，前處長李鴻謨定今夏赴美攷察。滇貨物稅局長近亦易人，新局長趙恩鉅週內由渝來昆到職。滇民廳長人選，聞有變動，現由省委張邦進暫代。</p>

<h3>人類未來命運所繫　聯合國大會揭幕　出席五十一國代表二千餘人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播稱：在數小時內，聯合國大會即將展幕，此一會議，為近年來各國間各次會議之最高峰，其成功與失敗，有關人類未來之命運，大會除排難解紛外，并將奠定永久和平之基礎，務使戰禍永不復發。英王有鑒於斯，特於今晚在聖詹姆士宮欲宴全體聯合國代表。美國務卿貝爾納斯與蘇聯副外委員長維辛斯基及時趕到參加，為大會生色不少。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦九日電〕明日為國際聯盟在凡爾賽創立二十六週年紀念，聯合國適於是日開會，可謂不謀而合。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕聯合國五十一國之代表幾已全部抵達倫敦，英王及阿特里首相準備舉行盛大之歡迎會。至明晨歷史上最偉大之和平製造會議，即可在威斯特歐斯特之中央大廈隆重揭幕。現已抵達倫敦之各國代表，已近二千人，其中有於戰事發生後從未來此者，故已特派嚮導人通譯以資便利。各國新聞記者業已抵此間者約四百名，當局特撥電話七十具，專供記者使用。</p>
<p>原子問題　英美取同樣態度</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦八日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯今日下午二時乘飛機抵此，渠在接見各國記者時稱：聯合國大會開幕後，原子炸彈安全保障問題，將為會議焦點，深信必能商得各國滿意之解決辦法。美代表國中對於保守原子能基本秘密一事，已有分成兩派之危險，其中一派以為美國向聯合國大會建議設立原子能管理委員會，在提案措辭上恐不免洩漏秘密，因之不無憂慮。相信美國代表團中此種對立形勢，亦可圓滿解決，即委員會之設立，同時兼顧安全是也。英國於此亦取同樣態度。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯曾於星期一在華盛頓發表談話，謂美國於組織所建議之原子炸彈控制委員會時，或將使用否決權，以保障其本身之利益，此語曾引起各方面相當之緊張心理。貝爾納斯已於昨日抵達倫敦，或可有助於此項緊張局面之廓清。莫斯科三強外長所成立組織原子能控制委員會之協定中，曾有「向該問題各方面調查」一語之規定，美國人士一度因此項用語之用意而發生恐懼，彼等以為此即美國應將關於原子彈之一切秘密，供給其他強國之謂。已抵倫敦之一部份美國代表，對於莫斯科公報關於原子能協定之措辭，亦有若干誤解，故曾表示此類措辭應加以修改。</p>
<p>大會議程　先解決五項問題</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦九日電〕大會討論之問題，以原子能管制為重心，此外尙有下列五大問題：（一）安全委員會，由中美英蘇法五國為常任理事，尙須選六小國為非常任理事。美國責成西半球方面由加拿大·巴西·及墨西哥當選，其餘三國大約如埃及·荷蘭·及波蘭。惟加拿大入選後，澳洲即無當選希望，雙方或將發生爭執。（二）推選大會秘書長及職員。（三）託管委員會應否設立，以便管理第一次大戰時之各委任統治地。此將為美英兩國與蘇聯間之問題。英美責成依照前國聯委任統治辦法，組織臨時委員會，主張自始即組織永久委員會。（四）聯合國家是否將立即設法安插世界各戰災區難民，此一事件，將使大會對巴基斯坦猶人移民問題，不得不提出討論，英外相貝文曾稱，渠亟願聯合國討論此一問題。（五）聯合國大會永久會址問題，籌委會曾建議設在紐約及波士頓，一部份人士相信，中國及澳洲將堅持會址應設在舊金山。</p>
<h3>各國出席代表　幕後活動堪注目　棘手問題避免公開討論　法國將由戴高樂親出馬</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦七日專電〕今年一月將為國際關係中重要一月，此不僅因聯合國機構於倫敦成立，且因各國外長及高級政界人士咸集於此，由此將有大好機會，進行非正式之「幕後」討論。消息靈通人士預料，此種非正式之會商，將較聯合國大會之正式商討，更具　大影響，尤以對歐洲關係為然。各大國均極盼聯合國機構議事時，保持最大可能之和諧一致，因此任何足以引起爭議及棘手之問題，或將不致於聯合國大會中提出，蘇伊及蘇土關係，即為兩棘手問題，聯合國大會規定於四日午夜以前，可提出任何國際討論事項列入議程，過時即不接受。土伊代表團并未將其問題提交大會，列入討論議程。盛傳土伊兩國之未將上述兩問題提出大會，乃因美國政府之有力而非正式之反對。美政府堅盼聯合國機構成立之際，勿討論可能促使英美蘇三國不和之問題。然若干歐洲問題仍極棘手，倫敦於過去數日內，對蘇伊及蘇土緊張關係頗表焦灼，英國聲稱，其重大權益與此兩項問題牽涉相同，蓋將影響其至印度及遠東之「生命綫」也。西班牙問題亦必將提出討論，據悉，英美法三國外長，將可能致力協調三國對西之政策。</p>
<h3>韓要救取銷　託治決議案　韓駐渝代表團　電美英蘇外長</h3>
<p>〔合眾社重慶九日電〕韓國臨時政府駐渝代表團，今日致電英外相貝文，美國務卿貝爾納斯與蘇外委長莫洛托夫，要求取消莫斯科會議中朝鮮託治五年之決議。電文中稱，不然「吾人將奮鬥至死，吾人決不能接受」。致莫洛托夫之電文中，指出列寧於一九二〇年承認韓國臨時政府，而史達林在德黑蘭會議中，再度確認韓國之獨立。</p>
<h3>美總統招待記者　報告國際情勢　對莫斯科會議成就表滿意　美國承認南羅保附有條件</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓八日電〕杜魯門總統今日在記者招待會上宣稱：彼對於最近莫斯科會議所發表之公報，以及三外長之成就表示滿意。總統答覆詢問時表示渠對於莫斯科所獲關於佔領日本之協定，已予完全核準，渠稱，渠始終贊成設立日本諮詢委員會，而盟軍亦應有設立此項委員會之權利也。某記者詢以總統對於貝爾納斯昨日所作關於原子能之國際管制聲明有何批評。總統答稱：貝爾納斯之聲明，已將該問題作祥盡而完全之討論。總統答覆又一問題時聲稱，計劃中之原子能委員會，將僅供聯合國代表之諮詢，此事即將提交國會討論。總統又稱，原子能委員會將在美國提出管制原子能立法之議案，至聯合國原子能委員會，則將使國際管制原子能問題獲致能令全體人士滿意之結論。有詢以貝爾納斯之聲明，是否將使曾對自衛與國際管制原子炸彈問題表示懷疑者滿意？總統答以肯定之語氣云，是乃貝爾納斯聲明用意所在。當詢以總統對於華盛頓郵報上所載關於美國應即停止製造原子炸彈之建議有何批評時，總統曾作反面答覆。</p>
<p>巴爾幹問題　論及巴爾幹問題時，杜魯門稱：根據今晨紐約時報之記載，則羅馬尼亞方面已獲建設性之結果。某記者問，關於承認羅馬尼亞及保加利亞兩國政府之事，政府有何計劃？杜魯門強調稱，除非該國政府等具有雅爾達會議所定自由而不受壓制選舉之保證，美國將不予承認。</p>
<p>某記者指陳，雖然南斯拉夫最近之選舉并非人民志願之真確表示，而美國已經承認南斯拉夫政府一事，總統答稱，承認南斯拉夫政府為具有條件的，且迄今仍為有條件的承認。渠稱，當茲一面得勢之情形之下，承認實為必要之舉，惟美國希望得見南斯拉夫情勢之進步。又記者問，關於派遣駐莫斯科與羅馬大使之事，有何批評？</p>
<p>總統稱：哈里曼大使自德國投降以後即擬辭職，惟渠仍允繼續工作，實屬可感。渠稱，渠已敦促哈里曼大使仍留原職，并盼哈里曼大使不致再辭，至羅馬之情形則與前無異。</p>
<p>準印人移美　最後有詢以印度移民問題者，杜魯門以肯定語氣答稱，渠贊成凖許印度人移居美國，其限額與華人入境相同。按眾院已於去年十月通過一案，準許每年有印人一百名移殖美國，并許今在美國之印人，約有四千名可歸化美國。</p>
<h3>蘇聯有原子彈說　美總統并無所聞</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓九日電〕杜魯門總統昨在招待記者席上聲稱：關於倫敦特里消息所傳蘇聯已有一種原子炸彈，其威力遠較英美所有者強大一節，渠并無所知。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦特里九日電〕英科學家安買托博士所稱蘇聯已有較英美更新式之原子炸彈一節，杜魯門總統昨予否認。本社記者頃以此叩諸安博士，據答稱，「俾士麥曾云，政治性言論，非經否認，不見真實。今後之言論，應來自蘇聯當局，杜總統之言確否，唯事實可證明之。抑此問題應叩諸克里姆林宮，而不宜質諸白宮，於是杜總統可知其所信蘇聯并無原子彈一節，是否確實。</p>
<h3>蘇軍官攜公函　冒雪抵漢城　與霍奇有所接洽</h3>
<p>〔聯合社漢城九日電〕蘇聯軍官數人今日分乘小型飛機二架，冒雪到達此間。據悉，蘇聯軍官此行，攜有韓國北部蘇軍司令契斯希亞哥夫中將公函，面呈韓國南部美軍司令霍奇中將，內容聞係接洽美蘇佔領軍當局會議地址問題。</p>
<h3>越獨立同盟　獲選民擁護</h3>
<p>〔中央社河內九日電〕全越總選之初步結果，越南獨立同盟會已獲得全越人民之擁護面獲勝。越南政府已定三月三日召開全越國民大會。</p>
<h3>幣原內閣準備總辭職　另組聯合政府　自由黨鳩山一郎將任首相</h3>
<p>〔合眾社東京九日電〕幣原內閣聞即擬全體提出辭呈，另讓賢能，繼起組織一新聯合政府，繼任首相人選，已於今晨披露。即企圖推翻原內閣之自由黨魁鳩山一郎。據每日新聞息：此次主張內閣辭職最力者，為內閣法制局局長奈良橋與厚生相蘆田均，二人俱係自由黨黨員。如幣原內閣一旦總辭，鳩山即準備繼起組閣。但眾信渠所領導之自由黨恐尙不足單獨負此重任，社會民主黨迄今為止，似尙響應自由黨之行動，故鳩山勢將邀請該黨合作。鳩山茲已開始與各領袖商談，俾幣原內閣總辭時，遴選渠等入閣。（編者按：鳩山一郎一八八三年生於東京，年六十三歲，現任日本自由黨總裁，為律師出身之日本自由主義領導人物。歷任眾義員及政府要職。一九〇七年畢業於日本帝國大學法律系，其後曾任東京市議會會長，政友會秘書長，曁政友會執行委員，一九二七年田中內閣時代出任內閣書記長官。一九三一年犬養毅棠閣時被邀出任文相。侵略戰爭爆發之前，議會展開侵略戰爭質詢戰時因渠反對軍閥黷武行動，曾致引起軒然大波。此次由幣原首相推薦出主日閣，顯係自由主義派行將抬頭之明證，同時預料鳩山必將與社會主義派取得合作，以期渡過日本政局之難關。</p>
<p>〔合眾社東京九日電〕日本政界消息靈通人士稱：日本在即將舉行之普選後，頗有成立聯合政府可能。觀察家謂：設四大政黨并無一黨獲得極大勝利，此項可能性似將成為事實。所謂四大政黨者，即自由黨·進步黨·社會民主黨與共產黨。各黨人員刻已開始考慮：設聯合政府被提出後，彼等究將遵循何種政策。選舉原定於一月二十日舉行，但由於麥師最近之「肅清」指令以及內閣所面臨之危機，故業已延期。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京九日電〕朝日新聞今日載稱：因最近麥帥指令，約有法官及檢察官二百人將被迫辭職，包括若干最高法院若干人，及司法省主要官員在內。司法省將於本月十一十二日召集主要官員會議，討論辭職之事。最高法院曁全國高等法院八處，地方法院五十二處之法官及檢察官，均不免牽及。按在平時，日本法官均為終身職。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京九日電〕據協同通訊社今晨報告：農林省官吏及職員，要求將日本公務機關澈底加以「民主化」，此項要求，由公務員自身提出，尙屬第一次。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京九日電〕朝日新聞今日載稱：因最近麥帥所頒指令之結果，日本經濟界主要人物二人，已決定辭職，此即經濟聯盟及主要工業委員會主席松本及日本總商會主席藤山，同時日本第四經濟大集團即工商業聯合會中央委員會主席伍堂早已以戰事嫌疑犯被逮。</p>
<h3>為美軍請求復員事　杜魯門發表聲明　橫濱檀島美軍亦有示威行動</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕杜魯門總統今日在記者招待會中宣稱，陸軍復員延緩，乃由於世界各地均亟需軍隊之故，陸海軍復員以來，其效率俱可稱道，且對各方面一例公允。至於士兵對復員訴苦者，須知軍隊之縮減，實已儘速進行，但因種種原因，未能使人人迅速退伍。美國面臨艱巨之工作，對於保持和平與摧毀敵性國作戰潛力，庶不令再起戰禍，美國必須分担完全責任。復員并非一種隨意之行動，乃國家在戰後艱難時期中，為實行其義務所不可避免之事。美國之將來，現仍存亡莫卜，無殊於戰時，故吾人務必竭盡所需能力，為世界未來和平奠定堅固基礎。由陸海軍及海外部隊已復員人數觀之，可以引為奇蹟者，非若干陸海軍士兵猶未歸國，乃已有如許士兵已返抵家鄉耳。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕杜魯門總統秘書庇豆遜以厚六吋之紙一疊呈諸總統，據謂，紙上簽有菲島美國士兵三萬人姓名，對陸軍復員政策提出抗議，此項抗議書係郵寄至美國，在簽名之前有一口號曰，「無船則不投票」。</p>
<p>跡近譁變　〔聯合社橫濱九日電〕美軍憲兵司令馬霍奈上校今日宣稱：美國第八軍一部份士兵，昨日歡迎陸長柏德遜時曾高呼「我們要回家去」，此種情形跡近譁變，旋為渠所驅散，并曾向肇事士兵作簡短演說，加以嚴責云，今日在士兵中發現未具名之油印傳單，名曰「退伍」，指責馬霍奈辱罵各士兵為「混蛋」，傳單上并宣告定於本月十日下午五時半，在第八軍司令部前舉行群眾大會</p>
<p>〔聯合社檀香山九日電〕此間美國士兵一千五百人，今日亦舉行大會，抗議復員延緩，人聲鼎沸，惟秩序尙佳。會中決議致電杜魯門總統，演說者對陸長柏德遜之復員程序，及國務院各項政策，加以抨擊。事先，中太平洋美軍司令李查遜中將，曾向部下告誡勿作任何「愚笨行動」仍歸無效。</p>
<h3>美再邀蘇參加　遠東委員會　中美代表團抵橫濱</h3>
<p>〔聯合社橫濱九日電〕遠東顧問委員會美國代表團，今日乘美國輪船「麥金來」號抵此。該輪所載貨物起卸後，即將駛赴東京作顧問委員會總部之用。據美國代表麥考埃稱：美國務院已於兩日前，邀請蘇聯派遣代表出席遠東顧問委員會，現在候復中。吾人來此，係與麥帥商討并考察此間情形，以便協助參加對日作戰之聯合國，促使日本履行投降條件。參加各國并應共同決定將來對日政策，吾人深知參加各國對日本佔領工作及麥帥所實施之各項政策，均已深感滿意云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社橫濱九日電〕遠東顧問委員會中國首席代表朱世民中將，亦已於今日到達此間。</p>
<p>〔路透社橫濱九日電〕遠東委員會主席麥考埃少將今日在此披露：華盛頓國務院已於兩日前再度邀請蘇聯參加遠東委員會之工作。</p>
<h3>日婦女代表　要求參政權</h3>
<p>〔本報東京九日電〕日本婦女代表團今日晉謁盟國統帥部，發表談話稱：「大選之期已近，將為日婦女推選政府官員之首次機會，候選人應不分性別，且應屬於曾努力肅清封建殘餘份子之人員，」該項談話由社會黨齋藤夫人等簽署。</p>
<h3>義在日資金解禁</h3>
<p>〔本報東京九日電〕日本政府九日下令解除義大利政府存於橫濱正金銀行之資金，供該國大使館作職員薪金之用，以維持義國財產權及供給義國僑民費用。</p>
<h3>法將向暹要求　歸還越領土</h3>

<h3>美原子專家組織　美科學家聯盟　為謀公眾及國家福利　創擬大規模教育計劃</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約七日專電〕積極主張以聯合國充分合作為基礎，由國際控制原子能之大多數原子專家，已順利組織一全國性之科學家聯合機構，名為美科學家聯盟，以創擬一大規模之民眾教育計劃，以規定關於原子能等之科學研究事宜。該聯盟有個人會員二五〇〇人，製造及研究原子彈雷達及其他秘密武器有貢獻之人士所組各種團體，為該聯盟之組織分子。該聯盟將參加積極之政治工作，旨在進行關於公眾及國家福利之科學教育工作，并連用其權力，左右有關科學教育工作之立法。該聯盟之總會址將設於華盛頓。</p>
<h3>可怖哉！　原子彈威力　廣島今春將無青草　長崎祗見廢銅爛鐵</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京九日專電〕若非身受廣島或長崎兩地原子彈爆炸之經驗者，絕難了解原子彈之絕對可怖性，更難相信一顆炸彈，對一城市之破壞力如此強大。廣島被炸迄今已達七月，然現仍有人因受原子彈爆炸之影響而不免死亡，今春廣島將無綠草生長。長崎之破壞程序，雖與廣島相仿，尙幸四週有山足為屏障，但見各工廠之廢銅爛鐵散佈成行，而各廠屋基則已東倒西歪，因受震而不復原位矣。長崎之山隔絕原子彈之威力，使城內其他部份不受影響，然因此而山腳幾被拔去。統計廣島一地，被原子彈炸死受傷及失蹤者達十三萬，房屋受損達四萬九千七百二十七棟，受損地區中有一處之受害週圍，達直徑四公里之長。長崎之受損程度較淺，死傷及失蹤者六萬六千一百四十四人，房屋受損一萬九千五百八十七棟。據廣島市長木原稱，廣島之重建仍在計劃中，但即使計劃一事，亦需六個月時間方克完成。現破壞之區，仍如五個月前初炸時僅有少數簡陋之住屋倉卒搭成，以禦寒冬。記者乃曰，然則南京與馬尼剌之重建，又將如何乎。</p>

<p>無錫　公路交通積極搶修</p>
<p>本邑交通公路錫滬，錫澄·錫宜·蘇錫等幹綫，抗戰以前，完好無缺，各地商旅，朝發夕至，莫不稱便。抗戰時期，各公路路面橋梁，均遭敵偽破壞。勝利後，復遭奸匪摧毀，各路交通，未能迅速恢復。三方面軍曁蘇省府當局，積極修復大江南北各公路，并限去年十二月十六日起動工，至本年一月十日前搶修完竣，其中錫澄公路業經修竣，并已由錫澄長途汽車公司通車，蘇錫路亦已修復三分之二，僅有若干橋梁尙待修理，自無錫至宜興，亦已於週前修復，汽車已能行駛，關於京滬國道，由滬經蘇州·無錫·至武進段，及由鎮江經句容至南京段，均已搶修完竣，由武進經金壇丹陽至鎮江段，於本月十日前，亦可修竣通車，從此由滬至京，遙長四百餘公里之公路即可暢通無阻。</p>
<p>海州　匪軍驅逐婦孺離鄉</p>
<p>海屬述贛兩縣及東灈兩縣各鄉村，早被匪軍多數佔踞，人民處於水深火熱之中，近月來匪方對民眾之壓迫，更變本加厲，現竟實施其查封毒辣手段，凡在外流亡者財產房屋，均被查封，并驅逐其家屬，脫離匪區。所有匪區之婦孺，因不堪匪軍虐待，乃毅然拋棄一切，流亡至收復區，於此亦可見民從對匪軍之向背。</p>

<h3>適應國內外現實生活需要　英厲行緊縮政策</h3>
<p>— 本報英特約記者　徐誠斌</p>
<p>在英倫每談起吃，大家都無精打彩。打仗六年，糧食情况愈來愈糟，朋友們不時發牢騷。「倫敦空戰的時候，店舖中有酒有肉，可是大家忙得透不過氣來，沒有工夫去享受。現在打完了仗，論理應該舒服一下了，可是什麼東西都弄不得。」這是實話。在衣食方面，勝利並未放寬統制的尺碼，希望恢復當日生活的老太太們，已覺得她們估計的錯誤。今年九月發下半年度的購衣券，大家以為戰爭結束，購衣券可以多發幾張，那知戰時六個月所用的二十四張購衣券（買不到一套衣服），現在要用八個月。明年夏季或有增加的希望，但是目前決不可能。</p>
<p>美金外匯換軍火國幣陷空虛狀態</p>
<p>單在衣食方面，即可看出戰後英國經濟的窘况。六年來工業全部致力於軍火生產，　靠外銷平衡出入的政策無法推進，戰費每年達五十餘萬萬鎊，美金外匯，大部已換了軍火，國庫之窘，到了空前的田地。據政府白皮書發表，作戰六年，國外的資產，截至本年六月底止，已變賣了十一萬萬八千萬鎊，此外還欠了三十三餘萬萬鎊外債，分列如下；</p>
<p>金鎊區域　數目（以鎊計）</p>
<p>自治領　三八四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>印緬及中東　一·七三二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>其他　六〇七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>非金鎊區域　數目（以鎊計）</p>
<p>南北美洲　三〇三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>歐洲　二六七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>其他　六二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>黃金及美金準備，截至本年十月底止，只達四萬萬五千三百萬鎊。出入的不敷，至爲明顯。戰時唯一收入，是國內的幾項稅與公債，歸根到底，還是國內人民自己的錢，不能算是收入，通貨能避免膨脹，全賴統制得法，人民守法，但是統制不能一輩十維持，人民不能一輩子十穿破襪子。工黨上臺以後，第一個難題，便是如何維持物價，應付人民的需求，增加生產，恢復戰前的經濟優勢。算來算去，只有縮緊腰帶一路。到海外去採購糧食，花錢又花噸位；放寬百貨統制，外銷便受影響。英國經濟生命，原在幾條船上，船的用途是運貨出國，賺到外匯方能裝貨回國。要裝貨外運，國內只能實行緊縮政策</p>
<p>美停止租借法案英國喫了當頭棒</p>
<p>戰時的經濟來源，不出二端：一是稅收，二是租借法案下的美國接濟。戰事結束不久，華盛頓即予警告，立即停止租借法案，英倫朝野幾如當頭吃了一棍。問題之嚴重，不下於戰時最緊張的關頭。一時神經過敏的謠言紛起，有人說美國未必贊成新上台的工黨的作風，特來這一下警告。有人說美國要霸持世界商塲，不讓別國有競爭的機會；反正大家都生了美國人不够朋友的感覺的白廳（即英政府所在地）方面的反響是立即派遣大員專家到華盛頓去談判，在假的哈里法斯大使銷假回任，同時在國內宣佈加緊節省美匯。比後駛往澳洲紐西蘭的船隻，一槪不必走巴拿瑪運河，情願繞道南美，而多走兩百多哩路，這樣每年可省去五百多萬美元的通行費。其實英國雖窮，決不致付不起巴拿瑪運河的通行費。這項措置，只是對華盛頓表示不滿而已。</p>
<p>英反對公開競爭拒絕放棄其特權</p>
<p>華盛頓方面的態度，不難理解。租借法案是戰時實行有錢出錢有力出力的宗旨，戰事結束，不能繼續維持。反之，借錢給人做復興工作，恢復世界市塲，利人利己，只要利息有着可以商談。華盛頓談判三月，中間數度擱淺，到執筆時總算已圓滿結束。英國要舉債，但是不願付息，理由是力不從心，美國的要求，據此間報紙猜測，是終止不列顚自治領內的帝國優先制度（Imperial）Preference）金鎊區械是英國最穩固的商塲，別國不容易打進去，加拿大雖不在金鎊區域之內，也是尊重帝國優先權的區械。美國願意借款，但是希望英國肯放棄這項特權，開放自治領的商塲，公開競爭。這是英國絕對不能考慮的條件，出利息借款已爲困難，莫說放棄手頭唯一有把握的市塲。事實上，大英帝國經濟情况之窘，有史以來莫甚於今日者。西歐諸國過了多年的淪陷生活，國內物資已被總國搜刮一空，幣制不穩，購買力弱，決無吸收英國貨物的能力。原在中柬的優勢，今日已不能斷言。遠東商塲，美國早已佔了上風。香港光復後第一批運到的商貨是美國貨，裝運的船隻是美國船，親眼目睹這批貨物下卸的一個英國海軍軍官官，立刻寫信給倫敦泰唔士報的編輯，指出英國商業的不利地位，提議政府派遣要員長川駐在香港，掛內閣閣員銜，專負督導遠東商務的要責。西歐遠東的商塲已成問題，若再放棄帝國內的商場，無異於自殺。華盛頓也體會英國的苦衷，磋商多月，觀點接近了不少，美國雖堅持不放年息兩厘的條件，却答應在英國商業不景氣的塲合下免收利息。這次附帶條件，打破了大家的難關</p>
<p>設備陳舊產量少不足與美國頡頏</p>
<p>四十四萬萬美金借款，雖不能解決復興的一切閒題。人力，工廠設備，出品的質量，都是棘手的難題。上半年美國來了幾個礦業專家，研究一下英國的設備和產量，認爲落後太遠，不能同美國比較。設備舊，產量少，花費的人力多，成本便高，這是必然的情形。礦業如此，其它工業亦復如此，只是程度不同而已。在人工方面，最近遍及全國的罷工風潮，便反射出英國工業界的一個根本難題。</p>
<p>這難題也是緊縮政策的當然產兒。在戰時工廠由政府接辦，專製軍用品，一般工人的收入，遠超出平時的收入，甚有超出數倍者。戰爭結東，工廠恢復戰前的業務，資方要取銷戰時津貼，勞方不答應，談判成僵局，罷工的風潮使起。二月前全國四萬多船塢力夫罷工，等在港口內的船隻不得卸貨，裝載的糧食有腐霉之勢，影響到國內糧食的分配。政府看到形勢之嚴重，調了一萬多兵士去卸貨，同時由勞工部設專門委員會調解糾紛。調解的結果是工會應允先復工再開談判，到執筆時談判還在進行。工人要求最低工資，每週廿五先令（合美金五元），資方肯加到十九先令，結果如何，則不得而知。其它鐵路，煤氣工人的怠人，都出於同一根源。工人的要求並不是沒有理由，物價比戰前高了百分之四十，所得稅重，不加工資，不能維持生計。政府大抽所得稅，也有不得巳之處，抑平物價，維持國內經濟平衡，只有向人民要錢一途。工人爲了物價高所得稅重而要求加薪，政府爲了要使社會安定而抽所得稅，資方爲了要減低成本維持舊價而拒絕加薪——這是一個互爲因果的連環問題，英人稱之爲Vicious　Cricle，不是任何一方面委屈求全後便能取得根本解決的問題。</p>
<p>戰前戰後生活費相差百分之四十</p>
<p>受所得稅之累最大的人，不能算是工人。最近邱吉爾在議院中抨擊政府，說財政大臣無能，不能設法减低人民的負担。英國所得稅之重，世界各國無出其右者。年薪在二千五百鎊以上者，每二十先　要繳所得稅十九先令六辨士，這樣算來，年薪五千鎊與三千鎊的實際差別，只是二千個六辨士，合五十鎊。中等階級年薪四五百鎊的人，也要繳到四分之一的所得稅，單身漢抽得更多。照戰時稅率單身漢有八十鎊可以免稅，下年度可恢復戰前一百廿鎊的邊際數，但是戰前戰後的生活費用，相差至少在百分之四十與五十之間。單爲了徵所得稅，人民就不得不自動緊縮，再加上共他間接稅，生活標池自然降低了不少。</p>
<p>政府在人民身上緊縮的政策，在最近頒佈的利息率上更可看出。英美銀行存款的利息，遠較國內爲低，利息又是不勞而獲的收入，正是所得稅抽得最兇的一項。在戰時爲了提倡儲蓄節約，政府發行了負稅的債券，分儲蓄券與公債兩種，年息自兩厘半至三厘，單是儲蓄券一種，便銷走了三萬萬餘鎊，六年來在儲蓄運動下各銀行收入的存款，在一百萬萬鎊之上。在下半年度的緊縮計劃中，財政大臣宣佈停止發行年息三厘的債券，尙未到期的債券則减息撥付。據泰晤士報估計，减息半厘，每年可省七千萬鎊。這筆錢如果不省，也只是內債，其嚴重性不如外債之大。由此即可看出，英國採取緊縮政策的範團。</p>
<p>英實施統制緊縮針對着兩大目標</p>
<p>所有一切統制緊縮，都針對着兩個目標，一是節省外匯，二是出貨外銷。因為要節省外匯，所以糧食等舶來品須嚴格統制，因爲要外銷國內出品，所以國內消耗非緊縮不可。戰爭完畢英國工業首先遇到難題者，可以汽車業爲例。政府按照汽缸數目抽稅，稅率之高，使國內的人不敢問津。同時國外市塲尙未恢復，主顧無着，出貨無從推銷。汽車業要求政府重定稅率，冀以恢復國內市場，政府不肯考慮，最近工商局長克里浦斯在汽車業聯合會作客，與主席舌戰了一番，幾乎不歡而散。政府怪商人亦知賺錢，不知國家之難，商人怪政府只打算抽稅，不顧商人血本。事實是大家都有難處。</p>
<p>舉債不是好辦法不舉債更無生路</p>
<p>「舉外債，節省外匯，只是暫時的辦法，不能恃久。一個工業國家的復興之道，端在振興工業，增加外銷。振興工業，一個因素是人力，照目前每月復員一萬二千人的速度計算，英國工業到今年只能恢復戰前之半，明年夏季能吾完全恢復，是一個疑問。其次，美國債款五年後要開始撥付，工業產量若不超出戰前百分之五十至七十，還債的錢便有問題。白皮書的估計是明年度商貨進出不敷，可能到七萬萬五千萬鎊，一九四七及四八兩年，可能減到五萬萬鎊，一九四九至五〇年，可能再行減低若千，五年內的虧本總額，預計不在十二萬萬五千萬之下。這估計是在美國借款成立之前所發表，有了美國的借款，金融流通，週轉靈活，經濟生命可望加速度復原。</p>
<p>昨天反對派開始抨擊美金借款的條件。國內若干專家，認為借美國錢去買美國貨過難關，將來的危機更大，何况借款中若干條件束縛了英國商業的自由。英國在美的經濟代表凱恩勛爵（Lord）Keynes）與財務大臣陶爾頓的解釋，都含有無限苦哀「我們承認借款條件未達吾人之願望，但是在目前的情形下，我們所爭得的是最優的條件。」舉債不是好辦法，不舉債更不是辦法。</p>
<h3>英大貨船首次開到後港物價急轉直下</h3>
<p>— 本報特約通訊員　林友蘭</p>
<p>四年前的聖誕節，香港人盼望北極老人帶給他們一艘主力艦，四年後的今日，香港人盼望中的禮品，却是一艘大貨船。</p>
<p>「格蘭總統輪」上個月駛抵香港，載來戰後第一批的商貨，計有二千五百噸的洋酒·洋靴·化妝品·藥品·女人內衣·罐頭·雜糧·麵粉·蘋果·金山橙……現在已成百貨公司櫥窗內的珍品，吸引着一般人的眼睛。清香撲鼻的蘋果，當晚苜先出現於市面，每斤呌價六元，（戰前每斤僅値六角至八角），幸運的上海人，可比香港人先嚐這一別多年的美味吧？在格蘭總統之後，聽說「皮爾士總統」和「塔夫脫總統」兩輪，已在美國西岸上貨，不日將載更多的貨物前來香港。</p>
<p>格蘭總統戰來的是美國貨，（另有上海貨一千五百噸），令人憶起香港總督夏慤海軍少將十二日對英美記者發表的談話，據美聯社記者波爾引述港署之言曰：「美國船艦和飛機在中國領海內獲得完全行動自由，英國却沒有這種權利，所以，在貿易方面，英國似有不利」</p>
<p>本港美商活動情勢蓬勃</p>
<p>港督又說：「在香港，美國商人活動，甚爲蓬勃，因他們感覺在香港所能獲得的安全保證，實較上海所得者為遠久，蓋在上海，他們須受中國及常地政府所給予的稅收限制。」</p>
<p>關於香港的現狀，夏　說：「香港已逐漸恢復舊觀。自光復以來，食糧價値已低，跌百分之五十，但供應方面仍感不足，惟不必諱言，在工商業可能發之前，香港仍爲英國納稅人的一個負担。」</p>
<p>港督透露渠願會晤主席</p>
<p>夏慤對香港歸還中國的問題，有這樣一句話：「我們與蔣主席極爲友善。我希望不久將可與</p>
<p>主席會晤。」夏慤接着說：「福拉塞海軍上將，將在香港成癢癢英太平洋艦隊司令部。最低限度亦將暫時成立該部。但英國是否將使香港或星加坡成爲英太平洋艦隊的主要基地，迄今救災有次定。」</p>
<p>各項捐稅開始陸續徵收</p>
<p>夏慤說：「香港成爲英國納稅人的一個負担」，關於這一句話，也許要加註釋：目前香港在軍政——不如說是半民政——時期中，各種稅項還未完全徵收。香港當局的開支，須仰賴不列顚國庫撥給。這就是香港政費的負担轉落英國納稅人肩仔上的道理。這當然不能長期接受下去。當局現已接二連三發表公告，宣佈開始徵收各項捐稅，包括娛樂稅·煙稅·酒稅·地稅·警費·水費·商業領證費等等。不列顚王國是沒有虧本生意的。</p>
<p>誠如夏慤所言，美國商務在香港甚爲蓬勃，但英國商人並不見得袖手旁觀。香港軍政府民政部發起的香港經濟代表團，已於十八日首途飛往澳洲，採購各項日用品和建築材料。該團一行五人，內有華商兩名，預料在澳洲有半月的勾留。故澳洲貨物繼美國貨物在香港市場出現，為時當不在遠。</p>
<p>開放貿易當局宣佈辦法</p>
<p>香港目前最缺乏的貨物，是衣服材料·毛毡·被褥·磁器·和廚房用具等。月前當局宣佈開放香港貿易，並飭令出入口商舉行登記，商人採辦的入口貨，若與本港復興事業有關者，政府方面將予便利，而特別發給外匯。但有一點，必須注意，在金鎊集團內所存外幣，爲數不多，美元·加拿大金元和瑞士法郎，極難獲得，故商人申請外匯，須經縝密考慮，不輕易獲得准許，——香港軍政府財政顧問霍勞士如是說。</p>
<p>商人申請不到美元及其他外幣，但可申請金鎊。因此，假如訂購英國及其屬土的貨物，則毋須當局「縝密考慮」給予外匯的麻煩，有此關係，美國商人縱然活躍，不見得輕易奪去英國的市塲吧。</p>
<p>繁榮政策規定要點兩項</p>
<p>關於繁榮香港的政策，當局已經發表其兩大要點：</p>
<p>（一）必須使香港有一個廉價的服務體系，如低廉的勞力工資，便宜的船舶運輸費和港面起卸貨物費等。</p>
<p>（二）必須降低本港的生活程度，厲行物價統制，（當局對各行商，高價出售新到的美國貨，已有微辭。）</p>
<p>當局要求從前在港經商的商人從速由各地返港，又盼望其他商人來港經營新事業。他們明白表示，假如本港商務一且轉向其他方面發展，則將來再謀復興，實非易事。</p>
<p>新鈔兩噸由英空運抵港</p>
<p>英國製印的香港新鈔，重達兩噸，已由英空軍派機運抵香港。香港人袋裏也有咯咯有聲的新鈔，不必羨慕國內的「直版關金」了。銀行保管箱亦在進行辦理開放手續，燦爛的珠寶行將重見天日，而價値連城的契據或文書，亦不致長久被關在鐵庫裏嘆息。凡在日人佔領期內未有轉手或買賣的房屋物業，日內亦可恢復自由買賣。現在一般人正期待戰前各銀行存款的「解凍」，並期待恢復行使「日人迫使英國銀行負責人簽字發出的五十元。百元和五百元大額紙幣。但當局表示，這有待香港恢復民政後，才能有新決定。然而香港民政府，那時才能恢復呢？香港在軍政府統制下，已有四個月之久了。</p>
<p>撇開軍事的，政治的，和經濟的重大問題，香港當前可有兩三個小問題，正大傷一般人的腦筋，那是房屋問題，娼妓問題，和治安問題。前兩個住的和健康的問題，洋人似比僑胞尤爲談得起勁。</p>
<p>徵用民房住屋問題嚴重</p>
<p>洋人比我們會講求起居的安適。現在香港的高等住宅區，如山頂，跑馬地，尖沙咀，九龍塘，英王子道各處，其戰前租與洋人者，戰時都爲日人所佔，而今則爲英國海軍陸戰隊，皇家空軍或其他軍事人員所微用。那些軍人不免豪華一點，據英文南華早報加以評論道：「徵用房屋，必須切合實際的需要。如作爲倉庫，及公室或餐堂者，則宜另建小木屋，而不必徵用民房也」。該報籲請最高軍事當局對建築那柴木屋，加以同情的考慮，而交還若千房屋以供人民的住所。</p>
<p>僑胞覓屋深感供不應求</p>
<p>僑胞的住宅，亦感供不應求。昔日的棋房，有遭炸毀者，以灣仔，紅磡兩區爲最甚，灣仔乍非道全部，已無一間完整的房子。有遭歹徒拆去屋內木材者，這種被破壞的房屋，估計約佔全部房屋的二百分之一。有遭日人爲適應軍事上的需要而拆毀者，九龍城一地，計有十數條街道和三個鄕村的房屋，被夷爲平地，改作飛機塲。曾在日人鐵蹄下茍活過來的人，現在却發見他們的黃金機會。他們高抬房子的租値，甚至預租若干房子以待「善價出頂」。由內地來港的人，有些竟花數十萬元國幣項租一個房子，要是袋裏沒有如許的錢，那祇好屈居貧民窟裏，但仍須支付三四倍戰前的代價。</p>
<p>娼妓衛生主張強制執行</p>
<p>中國人對娼妓問題，向來不好意思公開討論，何况有些地方且有「笑窮不笑淫」的風尙哩。根據當前的情形，倘若因爲軍人衆多，便說香港是一個「軍人世界」，那麼香港現在幾乎無處無娼妓的活動，似亦足當「賣淫世界」而無愧色了。</p>
<p>香港戰前是禁娼的文明都市，因之，有些關懷世道人心的人，便重彈禁娼的舊調。洋人比較看重衛生，洋報再三刋出性病蔓延的報道，主張對娼妓實施管理，以便强迫執行衛生檢騐。某洋人投書於報紙，說是香港的妓女那麼多，敎他如何放心把太太和女兒接回來。</p>
<p>盜匪出沒比娼妓更可怕</p>
<p>有個朋友對記者說，在香港，欲找一個未當過妓女的女性作妻子，已成一件難事。說回來，我們男人何必多管女人的事，男人去作賊，不見得比女人去賣淫要高明或正當些。目前香港的盜匪，委實比娼妓更爲可怕——前幾天英文「華南早報的第版，盡是匪徒活動的新聞。白晝强搶，黑夜鳴槍，幾乎無日無之。假如眞是可能的話，我願紅袍白髮的北極老人將送給我一支最新式的自衛手槍哩。</p>
<p>日軍火拋入青森海</p>
<p>毁滅日本軍火製造工廠之工作，已由盟軍總部頒發指令，開始實施。圖示：日本兵士及小工，奉令使用駁船裝載軍火，開往本州北部靑森海外，將其全部擲入海中。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>雙重嘉慶的今日</h3>
<p>今天該是我們最愉快興奮的日子！今天我們實在有雙重喜慶大事，値得大家高興。在倫敦，今天聯合國首屆全體大會開幕，一切維護人類正義，保障世界和平的方案，正有待於聯合國大會今後的開誠商討，切實執行。在重慶，今天國民政府所召集的政洽協商會議也同時舉行，三人小組委員會商討停止衝突辦法後，「停止開火」的命令也許即可發出，和平解次之門從此大開，各黨派如眞能推心置腹，開誠佈公，中國政局也就不難走上光明幸福的大道。當中國血戰八年，世界烽火瀰漫，人類飽受慘禍之後，今天能够風平浪靜，烟消火滅，使我們得以窺見全世界和中國眞正和平之曙光，這確是幸運，確是喜事。我們抗戰首都在重慶，舉行政治協商會議也在重慶；到今天適逢國內國外均有喜事，眞可以値得「重慶」了。</p>
<p>聯合國全體大會，今後能否一帆風順，固然誰都不敢保證，但就戰時幾個民主大國的合作精神來推斷，由駢肩抵抗侵略，而迆於携手締造和平，幾次三番的會議，雖其間不免有些波折，而大體看來，總在步步前進，時時互助。尤其最近莫斯科三國外長會議，解次了許多懸案，而美蘇之間不可諱言的有關東方問題的若干隔膜確已消除過半。中蘇之間，除了三十年同盟友好條約簽打而外，最近又經蔣經國氏蘇京之行，解次了關於接收東北的許多有關間題，國軍且已空運抵達長春，東北政局勢必漸趨明朗。曠觀世界大局，祗要英蘇之間，能再就德國問題，歐洲問題，近東和中東間題等等，商得合理的解次方案，而中法兩國以及共他盟邦，在共各自有關的各種問題中，均能有其正當的地位，合理的主張，則大家開誠商討，必可於世界和平有很大的貢獻。我們以爲今後人類次不能再見殘酷的戰爭，而尤其原子彈發明以後，科學進步的爲禍爲福，確有待於人類自己的次定。今天聯合國大會開幕，乃是「天下一家」的眞正開始，我們雖然不敢信英美若干哲人與政治家所倡「天下國」或「世界政府」的論調就可實現於今日，然而至少可以認爲人類正向這個途徑前進，只要各國書尤其大國國外的這件喜事，確已喜氣洋溢，值得大慶特慶的了。</p>
<p>至於中國內部問題，說來原很慚愧。中國本是首先反抗侵略的大國，又是始終反抗侵略作戰到最後的一個大國。勝利以後，中國自有其國際應得之地位，中國人民也自有其安居樂業之權利。不料對外戰爭勝利了，而國內卻不免打起仗來，交通破壞，工礦損毀，地方騷擾不寗，重使人民「有家歸不得」，農不能耕，工不能作，商不能運，和平安樂成為幻夢！這三四個月的大好光陰，就是消磨於共軍的爭城奪地之中。猶幸天佑中國，和平未成絕望，政府旣能充分容忍，盟邦亦願居間斡旋，卒使姗姗來遲的共黨代表抵達陪都。今天，不但三人小組會業已會議四次，商定停止衝突恢復交通各懸案的要點，停截命令即可頒發，而且政治協商會議正式開幕，商討和平建國方案。和平，和平！建國，建國！這是多麼可喜可賀的名詞，這是千千萬萬人所日夜祈禱而願早日實現的美景！我們願預祝道個會議協商順利，我們尤其期望這杯慶祝的喜酒可以真正喝個痛快。</p>
<p>我們以為政治協商的進行，必須隨時公開事實，不尙偏面的宣傳，而且容許全國輿論作公正的論斷。這件事，成功失敗，不但國人太關心了，全世界人也都關心。協商成功，和平有望；協商失敗，戰亂不免。一出一人，太重大了。我們第一希望首先做到停戰，要切切實的認眞的停戰。其次恢復交通，就要在最短期間辦到鐵路暢通，航運無阻，而不容許任何方面再假借什麼理有所拖延，有所阻擾。而軍令政令的統一，原爲一個國家的起碼條件，今天政治協商會議的任務，最重要的莫過於此。如果避開這些核心問題不談，沒有具體解決，仍舊聽令共軍自為編制，自發號令，自定防地，自設術門，則一切協商都是敷衍門面的空談！所以我們以為各方代表，都要憑良心，講真話，大家為國為民，不可放過這一個和平建國的大好機會。而萬不可彼此鈎心鬥角，始終橫梗一個「黨」字一個「派」字在胸中，却依然忘記了一個「國」字！國家是人民大家所共有的，今天諸公協商國是，是非曲直，最後還得讓老百姓來講一句活。諸公如有什麼爭執不下的地方，也得請敎老百姓來一個公正的決定。要做到「天下爲公」的協商，必須先有「無我」的精神，如果大家還只念念於「我」黨「我」派，自然談不到了解容忍與互讓了。我們因此以爲祗有會議進行絕對公開，參加會議的人們。都抱着「事無不可對人言」的心理，能夠做到什麼，才說什麼，說了什麼，必定要做到什麼，自然可以成功，而喜事也就真正可以大慶特慶了。</p>
<h3>中英協同發展滑翔運動</h3>
<p>重慶中國滑翔協會在今年聖誕節曾舉行一次滑翔機模型飛行比賽，中國的航空事業最近確巳有了顯著的進步，英國也正努力地訓練駕駛滑翔機的人才。飛行人員的訓練本是一件很重要的事，另一方面也是軍事行動中的不可缺乏的條件。</p>
<p>最近英國正擬就了一個新的方法訓練駕駛滑翔機的人才，此項計劃在平時係包括在航空訓練團的計劇內的。航空訓練團是皇家空軍內的一支部，它的任務是訓練男孩子參加空軍，孩子們自十四歲起開始受訓，直到他們長成參加皇家空軍爲止，雖然這些孩子們的參加訓練團是自願的，而且他們是在課餘的時候受訓的，然而他們在戰時對於皇家空軍的服務已有了卓然的成績，他們是正是皇家空軍的幼枝，他們的制服和皇家空軍的制服很相像，他們也在皇家空軍官員的指導下受軍訓。</p>
<p>在英國生活中，航空訓練團將成一永久性的特有組織，它是英國將來的航空人員的培養所。英國航空部所發表的新計劃中還包含着雙座滑翔機的訓練，學生膳宿供給也是航空部所擬計劃內的事。</p>
<p>按着這新計劃，英國將要添置許多雙座滑翔機，本來的滑翔機都是標準式的單座機。同時英國也擬添置一〇〇架標凖式的單座機，以補助航空訓練團初級學校內，原有三〇〇架新式的單座滑翔機。</p>
<p>在航空訓練團的滑翔學校內，學生的膳宿是全由校方供給的，一切與皇家空軍同樣待遇。</p>
<p>因爲要實施新的計劃，現在已有二百名航空軍官在受訓以爲學校敎官，同時當局又特允發給旅行證，使遠地學生進航空學校時不致受到阻礙。</p>
<p>這些新評劃不但會使學生迅速進步，而且會使十萬航校學生中，大部都能學到滑翔的技能。</p>
<p>滑翔機駕駛員團是一切空述部隊中的一個主要的健全的部份，按着航空訓練團的新計劃，滑翔機駕駛員　中需要一個核心的組織，在現代的戰事中，爲着要應付各種奇異的戰術，這樣的核心組識是很需要的。</p>

<h3>游資趨向證券丙種升至一千六地產股票一致猛漲</h3>
<p>烚赤　昨不脫盤旋，隔日人心雖好，無如陪都市價未曾跟上，致逢高不乏供給，漲勢旣遭挫折，游資紛紛顧而之他，晨開後自八七萬四漸漸下挫，紗布因宋院長下令出售封存物資，每况愈下，人心不無影響，（聞配售紗七百件布七萬疋）午刻在八五萬左右掙扎，午後更為軟弱，現期步退至八三萬二而後轉入盤旋，結果較前收回跌二萬八，銀樓飾金掛九萬元，紋銀七百元，銀元四百六徘徊，暗拆以銀錢業籌碼過剩，紗廠帮亦有放出，昨息價約自六分至一角，全視需要而定，業中現致力於股票一門，需用遂少，短時期中息價勢難扳高。</p>
<p>外幣　美鈔初堅後疲，仍不能與金市相離過遠，套買者較爲殷勤，紗帮亦有吸收，低後尙形穩健，美物資船隻昨進口頗多，走勢較金市爲有力，晨開一四八〇元，後因金價下挫，引起賣風，節節下降，後以廠方吸收，套買稍盛，價遂在一四六〇元內外頗多支持，盤旋殊久，午後則受金市影響，退至一四四〇元內，較前收回降三十五元，港幣依然呆滯，銷路毫無，結果與前收相較，老貨跌五元，新貨一元及二元不等。</p>
<p>公債　環境利買，拉抬渚史無顧忌，國共停戰令不久可下，助長各方買意，丙種初開即承前日餘氣，升爲九八〇元，開後略有小挫，大戶續來拉提，遂自九六〇元左右逐步回好至一〇六〇元新高價，在此過程內，四川路某銀行及業中多頭陸續流出，致檯面漸感鬆動，雖漲而局面不脫平庸，午刻浮多稍有了結，乃掙扎於一千元關，結果較之前收再漲七十元至一百十元，雜牌以時間關係，反較丙戊佔優。</p>
<p>華股　繼續受外股游資所吸收，市况異常熱烈，新多源源加入，業中人不乏脫手者，餘資改向外股，因外股之振作，華股亦遙爲呼應，以致求供仍極紛杳，市價起仆莫定，永紗晨開一一二〇元，後步昇至一二二〇元左右，美亞自七八〇元升至八六五元，信和自二七〇元升至三三〇元，午刻仍因業中大戶放出，永紗退至一一〇〇元，美亞八〇〇元內，信和二八〇元，三小熱則較平庸，結果較前收計永紗續升八十五元，美亞升四十五元，信和四十五元，三小熱則漲三元至五元半不等，各冷門續有跟上：冷落已久之中國內衣，昨突遭大戶垂靑，自四十五元左右哄抬至六十元，最後則站定五十四元，新益地產亦因地稅有減低訊，而升至三十元光景。</p>
<p>外股　與華股游資繼續交流中，仍遭華股方面大戶所搜羅，逐步上漲，業廣因傳說地產稅則有減低之訊，炙手可熱，求者紛起，午刻較前收計怡紗漲三百五十元，怡啤升一百三十元，紙業一百二十元，業廣猛騰四百七十元，其餘橡皮股則以證券帮對彼並不注意反告小挫。</p>
<h3>絲綢微呈疲狀</h3>

<h3>茶葉內銷頗旺存底甚枯竭</h3>
<p>自勝利以來，本市紅綠茶國外去路雖尙居停頓，然國內若天津廣東等地，因交通逐漸在復常中，是以銷化日增，惜目前本市存底甚枯，故趨勢供不應求，連日行情迭告扶搖直上，昨市除天津帮續進炒靑烘靑綠茶外，本街店莊對於紅綠茶指染亦不息，更聞靑島帮日內或亦有動辦之說，乃人心益堅，市氣較上日大都賡升二三千元有奇，交易至堪活躍，綜共去化約在四百餘担之譜。</p>
<h3>紐約棉市堅穩</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約九日電〕昨紐約棉市開盤微漲五至七鎊音，開盤後不久買氣即形活躍，新棉的漲二十鎊音，嗣因西方電報公司發生罷工運動，電訊中斷，交易消息突受限制，市塲情形復歸平靜，收盤時老棉略有下挫，新棉市價頗形反動，中午收盤的高五至十四個鎊音不一。</p>

<p>紅總　到多而去化反呆，市勢步跌，查最高價與現市比擬，其降度已達三分之二，昨市中莊不及四萬元，普通三萬左右，上莊呌五六萬元，並聞潮粬亦有運到，故暫時殊乏回振之望。</p>
<p>海味　凡合於實銷者，售盤冒上，至有客帮點品者，行家即扳價，其上品之貨，更不肯放鬆</p>
<p>染料　以客帮對名牌熱門貨追逐甚烈，而以BB靛粉現貨稀少，甚至於須求諸各小型染坊，再則前德商某兩大洋行之貨，包牌於顏料號商，加以攫斷，市上籌碼遂益見枯竭。</p>
<p>洋紙　市價堅定，惟輕磅道林，因實用甚殷，而存貨較薄，尤見俏利，其他各貨小有參差，成交已見減少，客胃稍淡。</p>
<p>捲烟　因當局抑平物價，及日本烟廠不日將復工，小廠派貨如天鵝牌等絡續不斷，致買氣告衰，行情晨開即疲，午後更在賣多於買下續挫，結果均比前市軋小，老刀退入六千元內。</p>

<h3>目前所需要的音樂教育</h3>
<p>— 宋壽昌</p>
<p>在這新年，我們的眼前擺佈着一種新的氣象，對於一切，便應該抱着無窮的新的希望。如果去年是勝利之年，那末今年該說是建國之年了。自從抗戰勝利之後，各項的建設，都在積極的推進，尤其文化敎育事業，更多新的計劃新的設施。以上海市而論，關於推進藝術敎育的，敎育局有美術中心站，勞作中心站，音樂中心站的籌設，以及上海市立戲劇專校的設立，至上海市的博物館，則已在籌備復興之中。這種種的計劃與實施，於文化敎育事業的推進，關係至爲重要。可是實施的過程，我以爲應該先從目前切要的做起。茲就音樂敎育方面管見所及，提出幾點意見：</p>
<p>（一）注重音樂教育的普及中小學校音樂科的目標的第一條，爲發展學生音樂的才能與興趣，所以除了一般的學習之外，還要注重音樂天才的培養。可是在目前，音樂，美術等科，在學校課程中，還是被視作閒科，應該先使一般人對於音樂有相當的認識，予以積極的指導，以達音樂敎育的目的。</p>
<p>（二）訓練音樂敎育師資　要使音樂敎育的普及，必須有大量的師資來祖負這個工作，可是以目前的實際情形論，優良的音樂師資實在缺乏，希望各地遍設藝術專科師範，在師範學院添設藝術科，音樂專科學校注重音樂師資的培養，訓練優良的敎師來應付目前的需要。在音樂師資缺乏的目前，那末祗可由現任的音樂敎師來担任，不過要設法輔導他們，改進他們敎學的技術，對於這點，敎育部敎育應或敎育局應從速辦理短期的音樂師資訓練班，使他們有進修的機會。</p>
<p>（三）供給音樂敎材　一般音樂敎師在目前實施敎育上最感困難的，技術的修養的欠充分，尙在其次，却在於敎材的缺乏。因為音樂敎材不比旁的，它最當時間性，譬如：在抗戰時期所唱的歌曲，多屬衝鋒殺敵，激發情緒的，現在抗戰已經勝利，便不能適用，應以完成建國大業，發揚民族精神，提倡新生活運動的題材爲主了。要解決道個音樂敎材荒，那末應由推進音樂敎育者負起責任，從事選製，分發應用。</p>
<p>（四）利用播音事業　於全國省市首要的地區，普遍地裝置公共的無綫電及播音機，播送高尙的音樂，以供民衆的欣賞，藉收社會敎育的效能。其他如舉行音樂會，請音樂名家演講播音，也都是提倡音樂敎育的切要工作。</p>

<h3>法艦潛運戰犯案法如不改變態度　我將考慮新行動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者因外常傳法國政府發言人已正式聲明，關於「白爾相」艦事件，法國政府決支持上海法總領費禮浩之立塲，特訪我外交部駐滬辦事處秘書呂懷君，承呂氏告稱：法國現所堅持者，爲中法新的至今尙米簽訂，故認爲法國在華仍保有領事裁判權。</p>
<p>殊不知我國正式聲明取消法政府此項特權，尙早在民國三十二年五月，對法國駐華暫行代辦領事彭固爾之照會，事隔數年，始終未聞法方有何異議。即於我國承認戴高樂政府時，戴高樂政府亦未對此點提出反對，足見事實上法國政府已經</p>
<p>對此默認</p>
<p>法政府旣以未訂新約爲保持領事裁判權之藉口，則我國於三十二年對彭固爾同一照會中，我國政府亦曾聲明廢除法國租界，豈法國政府至今尙欲保持其在華之租界乎？不平等條約所規定之特權，我國本可片面廢除，且前述對彭固爾之聲明，固爲因法國非法承認僞組織，且與之簽訂條約之一種</p>
<p>報復手段</p>
<p>於國際公法自有其根據也。呂氏復稱，此案現已在重慶進行交涉，法人如仍不改變其態度，我國或將考慮採取進一步之新行動。記者又因報載法國政府將以此案移交聯合國大會討論，特詢呂氏對此之意見，呂氏反問，法國於今日尙欲保持其隨不平等條的而來之領事裁判權，與聯合國本身之理想符合否？且當事二國未經同意，亦不能由一國單獨請求國際法庭仲裁也。</p>
<h3>我對法抗議</h3>

<h3>希望和美國一樣中國能團結起來　陳納德將軍訪問記</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　邁天</p>
<p>前美十四航空隊飛虎隊長陳納德將軍來到上海後，無疑的又得使他忙碌一番。昨日上午九時半、當記者踏進他的會客室時、已見一位客人在和他談話。十點鐘剛和他告別，又見一人來找他，可見他所說在這裏時刻有人來見他，是一點也不錯的。</p>
<p>陳將軍到上海來，這是第二次。一九三七年五月問，他曾來過上海，後來因爲中日戰爭爆發，他就回國。他覺得這次所見的上海，和他第一次所見的，　有些改變。不過，他說：</p>
<p>贊上海人勤於工作</p>
<p>「上海人是幸福，，他們沒有受到什麼戰爭的轟炸等損失，僅路面·交通·方面有些破壞。」有一點，陳將軍認爲很滿意，就是：「上海人依舊很勤儉忙碌，他們都照樣的工作。雖然，要恢復戰前的繁榮，也須很長的時間。」他說：「我到過歐洲各地，那些人都意志消沉，一點工作也不想做，這是很不應該的。」</p>
<p>「將軍到過中國內地，覺得內地的人和這裏的有什麼不同麼？」</p>
<p>「唔，常然，我覺得內地的人比這裏的好，他們比較樸實，不像這裏的人有些虛假，學洋派的樣子。」他意思中國人最好還是保持着他們固有風俗</p>
<p>飛行過多兩耳失聰</p>
<p>正談話時，電話響了。可是陳將軍沒有聽見，後來我就告訴他有鈴聲，他問我是敲門還是電話。他說，他因爲飛行太多，耳朶聽不見，總好像有飛機的聲音在響，連隔壁的電話聲也聽不見。雖有許多醫生替他醫治，也醫不好。陳將軍對於美國·中國空軍上的貢獻，從他的耳聲一點，就可知道了。</p>
<p>關於訓練中國空軍的事，陳將軍說，他現在還沒什麼計劃，他這次來，僅是想看看戰後的中國。幾天內要去重慶見蔣主席及馬歇爾元帥等。</p>
<p>「如果蔣主席請將軍協助訓練空軍，將軍的計劃怎樣？」「我仍舊要想一想再決定。」</p>
<p>充實空軍多造武器</p>
<p>陳將軍認爲空軍學校應該設立多處，分佈在東南西北。但中國應該自己辦幾個兵工廠，製造軍器。中國現在的空軍和陸軍都很好，祗是沒有武器及配備物。美國之所以爲强，就是因爲工業發達，自己供給武器’現在中國空軍在美國各地受訓的，經常維持一千人的數目，每期畢業後就有新的送去，但他本人和這事沒有直接的關係。</p>
<p>「將軍回國期內，曾擔任什　工作沒有？」</p>
<p>「我在美國並沒做什麼，我到各處去遊歷。」</p>
<p>美人對華認識很少</p>
<p>「美國人士對於中國的印象怎樣？」</p>
<p>「美國人對於中國認識很少，他們以爲中國和美國差不多，是一個統一國家，而不知中國國內分成許多區域。」</p>
<p>「美國戰後的情况怎標。」「美國目前也沒有恢復和平時代的情形。國內勞工間題有糾紛，物價也高漲，人們祗想狂歡一下。戰後美國需要建立六百萬新家庭，那是要費許多年呢！同時美國要能恢復戰前狀態，也需要一年之久。」</p>
<p>「將軍本人對於中國政治方面的意見是怎樣？」</p>
<p>「我希望中國和美國一樣，能團結起來，將來一定要使國內一切發達。如交通方面，必須縮短路程，像從美國東岸至西岸僅費幾小時就可到了」。</p>
<p>共黨亟應歸併政府</p>
<p>「關於共黨問題，我和其他美國人士一樣，認爲共產黨應歸併政府。在美國也有許多黨派，但一個民主國家應該採取選舉制度，儘可以今年選共和黨，明年選民主黨，但一經選舉後，就應該成一統一的國家。」</p>
<p>陳將軍預備在重慶勾留一星期左右，然後再來上海駐留一時期，以後的計劃還沒定。他很想去中國北方及漢口·長沙·廣州·觀賞一番，還願意重遊他昆明的故居。有機會，他　打算去東京一行。</p>
<p>陳納德將軍是中國的好朋友，他幫助中國，愛護中國。記得去年秋大，陳將軍辭職回國前，昆明·重慶·各界人士，誠意挽留和熱烈歡迎他的情况，這並不是他一天兩天的功績所能造成的呢。</p>
<h3>片商贊同軍人免費觀電影</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各電影院代表及美國影片商代表，昨日下午四時，於大華大戲院，舉行會議，商討軍人觀劇辦法·據院方代表李迪霍氏告記者，前次會議中，片商堅決反對院方建議軍人免費觀劇辦法，後經李氏親自向美駐滬副領事霍華德要求，並具正式書面請求後，霍氏巳尤爲兩方謀一解決，故昨日會議結果，片商已同意免費觀劇原則。須由院方付交賃租影片代價，院方亦已贊同，至代價問題，尙待討論。惟片商對此事視爲一嚴重問題，提出條件頗爲苛刻，即如以後華軍在非免費招待時間內，再有同樣闖禍事件發生，則決定將全市所發給影片一律收回，現即等待淞滬警備總司令部保證此點後，方可實行。李氏決於今日携片商所提條件，向淞滬警備總司令部報告，並商討其他辦法。聞院方擬定每星期六中午，由輪流到之一組，即十家影院，同時免費招待。然司令部方面則要求於每星期日中午招待，最後決定待商洽後再行通過。</p>

<h3>柏林人在廢墟中</h3>
<p>— 安東</p>
<p>一隻死的獅子，總比一隻死狗來得雄偉。柏林的遣骸就比亞亨，亞森，抑或哥隆這些小城動人得多。光榮和威武的氣慨，依然隱的可見。在已死的表面，有其冷冷的尊嚴。</p>
<p>不過你總該瞧得出，柏林是一個暴發的城市，並非源遠流長。在戰前，柏林就是那麼陰冷生澀。它不比羅馬輝煌，無巴黎安適，亦少倫敦那份莊嚴。它太新了，不像其他古老都會都有其魅力與溫暖。同樣，柏林人亦自成一類，與西南部直爽的德國人絕不相同。他們是傲慢而無禮——出言不遜，毛手毛脚，却是機警非凡，善於取巧。</p>
<p>今日住在廢墟裏的柏林人，脾氣比從前更壤了，出言更加兇險了，舉止更加粗魯了。在這個城市裏，無友愛可言。在街上走，你聽柏林人彼此間的對答，你簡直不相信同胞之愛，同地之誼，竟容許這種驚人的惡劣態度存在。</p>
<p>他們似乎將對敵人的憤怒發洩到自己人頭上，稍一觸怒，放口便駡，鎭日在緊張和獸性的氛圍中。</p>
<p>因爲現在柏林是在勝利者共管之下，所以愈增緊張的空氣。雅爾太三頭會議所決定的聯合國共佔柏林，不啻放下一枚定時炸彈。顯然此項辦法的目的，在顧全大家的面子。柏林劃分三區，三國各管一區。目前三百萬腦子刁，嘴巴兇，而又陷於絕望的相林人的唯一工作，便是在三强之間，挑撥離間，造謠生非。</p>
<p>在城西一個以物易物的公開市塲上，我混入幾十個中產階級的德國人的隊伍中。我和一個衣着整齊，挾着一個油膩紙包的男人談話。「這是一磅鹹內」，他解釋，「這是我拿一個照相機和幾百馬克換來的」。他以前的職業是工程師，辦事處就在附近。人們馬上四面擁過來，選些柏林民意的表現中，最有趣的是角度的不時轉變，和說話的技巧。</p>
<p>當我踏上我的吉普事，一個老頭子突然觸觸我的手肘說：『記者先生，也許你可以帮我們忙。請你告訴聯合國政府，給我們一個特赦。假使所有納粹完全出獄，我們眞是感恩不盡了。不過為首的戰爭犯當然除外』。</p>
<p>我覺得柏林人並未完全被擊敗，也可以說並未「解放。」他們深信柏林的毁滅和德國的毁滅，都是暫時的現象。他們已開始着眼於將來。三百萬人可不算少。三百萬人立在昔爲家園，今爲廢墟之中，是有相當危險性的。柏林雖然不再是一個活的政治機構的中心，依然是德國心理的晴雨表。特別是寒冬將臨，在飢餓與失望之餘這三百萬機智與暴烈的柏林人的行動和反應，實在値得注意。</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>冷與熱</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>「冷」與「熱」，是兩種不同的感覺。這兩種不同的感覺，看上去雖有分別，而兩者的極端都會產生「痛覺」。所以極端的「熱」與「冷」，都將給人們帶來痛苦。誠如心理學家吳偉士（Woodworth）說：「冷點和溫點給人們皮膚上的刺激是一種劇痛。」我們每個人差不多都有惡寒和惡熱的心理，像在嚴冬的時候，總喜圍爐避寒，炎熱的夏季，則又喜覓找淸凉的境界，納凉消暑了。</p>
<p>對於天氣，我們當然喜歡春夏之交，或仲秋之際，因爲這時不太冷也不太熱，那就是溫暖了。人們所以樂於追求溫暖，實在由於溫暖給予人們的感覺是和煦和舒適，一種說不出的快感。人們大多貪戀溫暖，睡得暖烘烘的被窩，誰願意馬上起身？形容友誼的濃蜜，有時也用溫暖來作響，「溫暖的友情」，這是多够令人羨艷！心情的愉快，也常說「溫暖的心」。溫暖之所以使人羨　，使人留戀，只要想一下溫暖的反面：冷酷，枯寂，蕭瑟，便可以知道了。</p>
<p>皮膚上「冷」與「熱」的感覺，每個人都不同，這由於各人的皮膚反應不同。但極端的「冷」與「熱」，爲任何人所厭惡，這是一定的。人情也有「冷」與「熱」，如果各自走向極端都同樣有流弊。對於他人純抱漠不關心的態度，甚至用「暗箭」傷人，「冷語」嘲人，使人不敢接近，這有些近於冷酷了，那裏是做人的道理？還有些人，自命爲「老於世故」「富於處世經騐」，對待他人完全憑所謂「理智」，（其實「理智」何嘗是這樣），執拗成性，剛辟自用，一絲情感都不肯施之於人。人與人之間，原是應該互求彼此問的同情和了解的，單憑一副所謂「理智」的頭腦去和人相處，這與冷酷何異？我想除了生活在冰窖中的人們，決不願意多遇冷如寒冰的人。此外，又有一種人，感情特別豐富，和親朋故知新交相處，常常傾出迸發的「熱情」來。他們信奉的是法國盧梭的「熱情的火花，可以把憔悴的心花救活」一句名言。生活在這冷酷的社會勢利的人間，誰不需要一些熱情，把將枯的心花灌溉一下？誰不希望從偉大的友情中美滿的愛情中找一些熱情來慰藉一下？</p>
<p>人們的心理不周，好惡各殊，而所表現於性情上的自然不會一樣。心理學家常把一般人的性格分爲兩大類：一屬外傾性格，一屬內傾性格。前者喜向外發展，好參加社會活動，有組織興趣，所表現於性格上的大抵是情感的奔放，豪快。後者喜向內發展，好沈思靜想，頭腦比較冷靜，當然介乎這兩種性格之間的人也儘多。外傾與內傾，均各有所偏，讓這兩種性格走向極點，則同樣會促成心理的不健康，人格的不完整。</p>
<p>熱情過度的人往往缺乏正常的適當的理智，心理被過度的熱情所攪亂，致使精神狀態失去平衡，情緒不穩定，久之足以造成「變態性格」。文學史上許多浪漫派作家，他們的作品，交織着極濃厚的熱情，不知感動過多少讀者，然而這般作家，十之八九都患過程度不等的「歇司的里」，哥德和囂俄京是顯著的例子。冷靜的頭腦是好的，但冷嘲的熊度是我們處世的「致命傷」，冷觀他人，把他人看做是自己的「玩味」「推敲」的對象，這簡直是在欺凌他人，貶抑他人，鄙視他人，壓詐他人。</p>
<p>最理想的還是保持客觀的冷靜的頭腦，仔細觀察社會上的一切，以熱烈的同情心，給社會和人羣貢獻出自己的能力。把人生社會改造得更理想，更進步。不是沒有理智的盲動，也不是沒有工作熱忱的消極冷觀。不是旁觀，而是協作。不是一味的冷靜，也不是漫無調節的熱的狂放。這是含有「建設性」的處世哲學，和工作態度。</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>醫治受傷的敵兵</h3>
<p>— 星聚</p>
<p>美國海軍進攻阿圖島，日軍頑强抵抗，美軍受傷的很多。</p>
<p>在艦上的手術間內，擠滿了候醫的美國傷兵，但最後忽抬進一個日本傷兵，在他兇惡的神情中，可以看出他壓制着恐懼，身上汚穢惡臭，　得人要作嘔。</p>
<p>艦上的美軍登時鼓噪起來，這是我們的敵人！這般陰狠，這般卑鄙齷齪！他仇視我們美國兵，殘殺我們美國人！還不將他扔掉，還不將他殺却！怎麼？還預備用美國的藥去醫他，用美國人輸的血去救他？</p>
<p>伊藤此時心中害怕，他想美國兵不刺死他，定要讓他受酷刑，割掉耳朶，拔去牙齒，千刀萬剮，斬成肉泥！</p>
<p>上的軍醫不顧這些，他命令將伊藤　進手術間去，他開始替他洗濯，替他輸血，替他開刀，替他割下炸毁的腿，替他小心綑紮，整整弄了一小時。</p>
<p>伊藤的神情逐漸改變，他頭上出着汗，嘴唇顫抖着，「亞美利加！亞美利加！」他忽然呌出來，眼淚淌下來大家都看呆了。</p>
<p>過了數日，伊藤的傷勢已好，他被送到艙下面一間房內關起來。</p>
<p>有一天，一個兵同醫生談起這事來，醫生說，「假若我那天衝鋒，遇到伊藤，我也許會一刀將他刺死，也許他另外還藏有一只炸彈也沒定，但是我們的軍隊並不曾刺死他，却將他捉了來，因為打仗時有時是値得冒險去將敵軍虜獲的。旣然將他送上船來他就是一個受着痛苦的人類，他有戰時俘虜的一切權利，我們應尊重這權利，而我們海軍軍醫部也祗有盡力的去醫救他。」</p>
<p>「你醫治他，也和治美國兵一樣當心嗎？」</p>
<p>醫生說「當然，醫生救人生命時，是不分高低的。我醫船長是這樣，醫日本鬼子也是這樣。我們醫治伊藤的經過是這樣的：起先，我們完全是爲軍事設想，我們的軍士不惜以自家的生命冒險，去將他俘獲，所以我不惜用檢血將他救治，因爲伊藤在軍事上也許是很有價値的。後來見伊藤旣然要登在我們船上，身上那樣汚具，我們必須將他身上殘毀部份除去，將其餘部份弄乾凈，這不僅是爲伊藤，也是爲我們自家設想。最後，我們是爲人道主義設想，我覺得伊藤那種感動的神情，確是很有希望的現象。』</p>
<p>醫生接着緩緩的道，「我覺得，我們處理日本人民，也應像治這傷兵一樣。我們應將那腐敗有毒的部份除去，可是，我們旣然要和這些人在這同一個世界上生活下去，我們必須要療治餘下的那一部份，使其在心身方面，都恢復健康狀態。」</p>
<p>醫學</p>
<h3>維生素的毒性</h3>
<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>維生素D有毒性，病人切忌自服。最近美國有一個婦人中毒而死，這是醫學史上第一樁案子。郝個婦人患關節炎，並不遵照醫師指示，服大量的維生素D製劑，每天多至十萬至五十萬單位（常人需要量爲每日四百單位），繼續至一年之久，結果發生變性銬化症，心臟腎臟血管等處都有大量鈣質沉積，因而致命。維生素D慢性中毒的徵象爲胃呆，嘔吐，泄瀉，肌肉疲乏，倦怠，頭痛，小便頻數，但因爲沒有醫生監護就不容易發覺注意。現在美國醫界已有人提議把維生素濃液製劑列入毒藥之類，禁止病人自己購服，以免發生同類事情。</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>大家自重！</h3>
<p>— 蔣宇良</p>
<p>一切地位的高低，都是由於自己爭取而造成。當然，自己盡了某種程度的努力奮鬥，也自有某種的地位的享受。這是必然的因果律。</p>
<p>我國經過八年艱苦的抗戰，在世界硝烟遍佈中，我國盡了盟國中應盡的責任。今天世界的法西斯打倒了，我們的當前的敵人日寇屈滕了！在世界同聲慶賀聲中，我國在國內步入建設獨立自由民主的新中國階段。在國際上，我國位居世界五强之一。在國際地位上講，我國的地位是增高了。但這却全由於八年艱苦抗戰，才有今天輝煌的結果。</p>
<p>我們旣得到了輝煌的地位，我們也一定要努力鞏固旣有地位。因爲我們今犬的享受，不是僥倖的，偶然的，而是積八年艱苦過程，以無數量的鮮血換來的。所以我們絕不能存暴發戶一般的心理，易得易失。我們唯有自重，從今後更力求自身健全。</p>
<p>上海相富於我國心臟地，是我國最易接近盟邦人士的地方，因之也是我國人士最易表現性格的機會。所以我們尤須自重。</p>
<p>最近時常可以在馬路上看到挺胸走過的盟軍，但後面却常尾隨着三五個我國靑年，手裏托着繡織的小巾，嘴裏喊着「要吧！要吧！」的跟上去。盟軍多昂然地略搖其首向前，於是我們的靑年才頽然地退下。當然，這也是一種生意的兜售，但這種情景無形中形成兩種國民性的熊度。而對於國際的觀瞻上，實在也是不大雅觀的。</p>
<p>在某些事實的表現中，我們常常不自禁地要求別人多加檢討，不可以再拿八年以前的心理與態度來對我們；可是我們也應多多深自檢討。我們今天更不能再因裝八年以前的心理與態度去對付盟邦人士。我們今天應當認淸自己獲有了輝煌高尙平等的地位，我們便首須自重起來。</p>
<p>當然，以上的事實只不過是舉了一個例，在今天的事實中實也有更多更大的存在。總之，我們一切都要自重起來努力。新的關係必須要有新的表現來建立牢固。因爲一切凡被外人輕視了時，一定先有自己値得被輕視的地方。</p>

<h3>尊敬國旗的常識</h3>
<p>— 一筠</p>
<p>國旗是代表國家的標幟，其尊嚴神聖可知。而一　人依然不明瞭其重要性，往往任意縣掛，摺　與安放，並有國旗破損？　色或尺度不正等種種現象，不一而足，甚至風打雨淋，或黑夜飄揚，有損國體及失却尊嚴，莫此爲甚，凡屬國民，都該特別注意的。自從市警局「懸掛國旗」實行統一後，全市市容，渙然一新，在靑天白日之下。不但壯觀瞻，國旗也頓然威武飛揚。</p>
<p>國旗應該日出而升，日落而降，本有一定的方式。旗落後不可蓆捲在旗桿上，或　諸墻角，或高擎壁隅，任受　埃汚點，茲將安置方法　下以供參考。如將國旗收下，平放左右上下各對折一次，即成為四分之一，然後將國　向上，但絕對不可再折，最好另製一木質扁盒，或用白紙及布包也好，如此放置，旣不汚損，亦莊重尊敬。此一簡單的常識，誠為每一國民所應知曉的。</p>
<h3>故意留難歟虐待平民歟？</h3>
<p>上海××社買火車票，要請情面，否則難於買得到，車站上買三等票，滬杭路早　天分杭州嘉興松江一個窗口，滬杭各小站一個實口，不料昨天在上海購票回長安，到站一看，眞不得了，從窗口排隊起，直到寳山路口，足有里許，到時二點，雖與開車時間尙有十個多鐘頭，然候至卅分鐘，一迄未移動一步，深恐長此候票，一經脫時，非再夜一宵不可，乃改購二等票，安知二等票，有二個賣票處，試問鄕村婦孺，咸知坐三等車人多，坐二等車人少，今滬杭一路，大小共有二十一站，三等車客人佔全體十份之八，二等車客人佔全體十份之二，今二等候票處二個，三等售票處祇一個，請問故意使三等乘客，多站幾個鐘頭買票？抑普通平民，可以加意虐待嗎？</p>

<h3>請求市府限期興建市房</h3>
<p>— 沈華興</p>
<p>今年是建設年，上海市之建設問題，雖手頭萬緒，唯莫過於屋荒之急待救濟解決。因八年抗戰以來，市中區外圍如南市·閘北·虹口·吳淞·江灣·眞如·南　等區域所燬房屋，數不勝計，故大部份市民及難民，十數人困居斗室，擁擠不堪，甚爲可憐。日今茍欲租一市房與住房，難如登天，屋荒之現象，到處皆然，挖費租費，其數驚人，非若戰前，只付三個月押租，可以租得房子，故祈求市府限期興建所燬房屋，至少限度，宜於兩年之內，恢復戰前原狀，誠刻不容緩之建設，亦嘉惠民生之德政，在勝利歲首，略表芻議，貢獻於市府，採納施行，是所厚望！</p>

<h3>流民從新做人（下）參觀漕河涇收容所有感</h3>
<p>— 董炎</p>
<p>牆角上有孩子站崗，監視甘於墮落的逃跳者。許多白麵鬼戒掉了嗜好，在草地上晒太陽，覺悟得較早的給他們職務，可以自由些，兇惡的，就要禁閉起來，直到悔過爲止。管理全部軍事化，所長周祖望師大出身，肯做無名英雄的工作，實屬難得。其餘職員也都只　微薄的薪水，做繁重的工作，他們就當收容所是一個大家庭，愛護它，　它，希望它成長起來，替建　工作負起一部份仔肩。</p>
<p>差不多四小時的逗留，這個收容所給予我極滿意的印象。他們並不祗是消極的收容，他們　難民難童治病，戒絕嗜好，然後再敎他們重新做人，做應該做的工作，尤其孩子，因爲改變較易，差不多全守紀律，改過自新了。試想五六百個孩子長大起來，可以走兩條路：其一他們都是好國民，生產者，我個的第二代；還有一條路，他們今依舊蕩在馬路上，做丐童，搶東西，大起來就是流氓盜賊。這截然不同的兩條路綫，給社會影響的好壞相去多少？</p>
<p>請每一個有良心的市民都想一想：爲國家，爲社會，也爲你自已，我們要救這批人，不但要使他們生活下去，還得使他們有用起來替社會做事，替國家盡力。</p>

<h3>Negotiation Conference Opens This Morning, Chairman Chiang to Preside in Person</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 9th dispatch] On the eve of the Political Consultation Conference, proposals from all parties, after many days of preparation, are largely completed. Government representatives will host representatives from all parties at a tea party this afternoon. Public opinion in the temporary capital expresses deep hope for the future of this conference, and encourages all representatives to abandon personal prejudices and prioritize the nation and the people. Social organizations have also held meetings successively, issuing declarations, expressing incomprehension regarding the Communist Party's continued military actions in areas like Northern Jiangsu, Eastern Hebei, and Southern Shandong, while simultaneously proposing an unconditional cessation of military conflict. Consequently, although the Three-Person Committee has reached an agreement in principle, concrete measures are still lacking in practice. According to the Communist Party's conditions, their so-called cessation of conflict seems to imply guaranteeing their current state of division, while the government believes that thorough implementation must be achieved under the principle of unified military command for any progress to be made. This is the focal point of disagreement between the two sides.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 9th dispatch] On the eve of the opening of the Political Consultation Conference, the temporary capital is filled with a tense atmosphere, and all parties place their greatest expectations on it. Today, representatives from various parties are extremely active outside the conference, unanimously hoping that this conference can achieve the goals of unity and democratization. Of the thirty-eight representatives attending tomorrow, only a very few will be absent due to illness or inability to arrive in time. The conference secretariat has established regulations for news reporters attending as observers. Foreign reporters entering the venue must first obtain a light green admission pass, which specifies their name and news agency, and stipulates that they must not carry handguns or wooden canes, otherwise they will be denied entry.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th dispatch] The Political Consultation Conference will open at 10:00 AM on the 10th in the National Government Auditorium. Chairman Chiang will preside in person and deliver a speech. In order to end political tutelage and return power to the people, the government legally conducted the election of representatives to the National Assembly before the war. However, after most of the representatives were elected, the War of Resistance broke out, making it impossible to convene the assembly. The government then convened the Political Participation Council in the 27th year (of the Republic), based on the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction, as the national public opinion organ during the war, contributing significantly to supporting resistance and reconstruction. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the government, in order to plan for peaceful national reconstruction and implement constitutional government as soon as possible, has convened representatives from various parties and social elites to hold the Political Consultation Conference to discuss relevant issues. Although the conference will only last for two weeks, all parties have high hopes.</p>

<h3>Ceasefire Order Not Yet Issued, Various Details Awaiting Discussion, Three-Person Committee Holds Fifth Meeting</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 9th dispatch] The Three-Person Committee's attempt to find a solution to the Chinese civil war failed tonight. The hoped-for issuance of a "ceasefire" order has also not been realized. After the meeting from 5:00 PM to 6:40 PM tonight, government representative Zhang Qun said: "Various details have not been resolved, the future is not bad, but difficult!" He admitted that there is still hope to resolve all outstanding issues tomorrow night. At that time, "we will have something more to say." When a reporter asked if there was still hope, US Special Envoy Marshall replied: "Yes, of course! Of course!" The reporter asked if there were any unforeseen difficulties? Marshall said: "No." The reporter further asked if tomorrow's meeting would be the last one? Marshall said: "Hard to say." When asked about the ceasefire order before the opening of the Political Consultation Conference, he pointed out: The Political Consultation Conference will open at 10:00 AM, and the Three-Person Committee will reconvene at 5:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Today, Marshal Marshall, Zhang Qun, Zhou Enlai, and others declared: an agreement has been reached on all key points. The meeting of the Three-Person Committee concluded at 4:30 PM today. Last night, Robert Smith, the US Chargé d'Affaires in China, also joined the talks. This was the longest meeting since the Three-Person Committee was formed. Marshal Marshall had originally planned to dine with the Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, at 7:30 PM last night, but he did not leave the meeting until 9:10 PM. He smiled as he walked out of the long meeting room, as did the other participants. Marshal Marshall refused to make any statement. Zhou Enlai said that although an agreement has been reached, the "ceasefire" order has not yet been issued. Other key points resolved include the restoration of transportation and the repatriation of Japanese troops. Zhou Enlai issued an oral statement saying: "The main parts of various issues have been resolved, but some details remain to be discussed and addressed." The actions of the National Army in Jehol Province have been criticized in some quarters, but the government authorities insist on their position that, based on the reason that Jehol Province was an Allied victory after the Japanese surrender, the actions of the National Army are clearly legitimate. The government side claims that there was no trace of the Communist Army in Jehol Province before the Japanese surrender, and the actions of the National Army cannot be compared with those in other regions and regarded as hostile actions against the Communist Army.</p>
<p>[Our Report] A San Francisco broadcast on the 9th at midnight stated: Marshall, Zhang Qun, and Zhou Enlai held their fourth meeting this afternoon. This fourth meeting may be the last meeting, and it is possible to issue the order before 8:00 AM tomorrow (the 10th) and organize an agency to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire order.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 9th dispatch] The Three-Person Mediation Committee held its fourth meeting today. No final agreement has been reached on the cessation of conflict between the Nationalists and the Communists. The meeting will be extended to tomorrow. If the ceasefire order is not issued today, the hope for a ceasefire before the opening of the Political Consultation Conference tomorrow will be dashed. After today's meeting, Zhang Qun told reporters: "The situation is not bad, but the problem is difficult. The committee's task is not completed and cannot release news. Negotiations will continue." When reporters asked Special Envoy Marshall whether he still had hope, Marshall replied affirmatively, saying, "No unexpected difficulties have arisen."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 9th dispatch] The troops advancing eastward from Jinzhou and Panshan entered Yingkou on the 9th.</p>
<p>[United Press, accompanying General Du Yuming's headquarters correspondent, 9th dispatch] The National Army entered the important port of Yingkou in Liaodong Bay on the morning of the 9th. While I was in General Du's office, the commander of the 52nd Army happened to send a report stating that his troops had arrived in the suburbs of Yingkou last night and began entering the city this morning, "The entire city can be in the hands of the National Army by dusk."

<h3>Correction of Letter</h3>
<p>The Central Wireless Yuan Equipment Factory recently sent a letter stating: "The news published in your newspaper on December 30 that the Wireless Electronic Equipment Factory will move to Peiping is inconsistent with the facts.

<h3>Peiping and Tianjin Begin Exchanging Puppet Banknotes, Finance Ministry Officials Say Financial Prices Will Not Be Affected, Central Printing Factory Prepares to Start Work in Peiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 8th dispatch] Yesterday was the first day of the exchange of puppet United Reserve Bank notes for legal currency in the Peiping-Tianjin area. In addition to the Central Bank, 11 public and private banks and 2 silver houses in the city exchanged at the same time. Because the exchange period is still more than four months, people are not rushing to exchange, so there is no crowded scene in front of the banks, and the bank staff are unexpectedly relaxed. The reporter personally went to the exchange office of the Bank of Communications in Jiaomin Lane at 10 o'clock and saw only a dozen exchangers, mostly shop clerks, holding mostly five-yuan and ten-yuan United Reserve Bank notes. Because in the midst of rising prices, these small notes have gradually lost their status as payment tools. It is heard that the official preparation work for the exchange in Peiping and Tianjin is generally good. A considerable amount of small-denomination 100-yuan legal currency notes transported from Chongqing is available. Soon, the printing of legal currency in Shanghai can also be transported to Peiping along the sea route. The printing factory is also preparing to start work, and the source of banknotes may not be a major problem. The social impact of the exchange of puppet United Reserve Bank notes is worthy of attention. Today, a Finance Ministry official told reporters that after the announcement of the exchange rate of one to five between legal currency and puppet United Reserve Bank notes, there was no fluctuation in the Peiping-Tianjin market. Today, the exchange has begun, which is the implementation of the established exchange rate. It is expected that it will not affect financial prices. However, according to newspaper commentary and street talk, it is not so optimistic, because the so-called small-denomination 100-yuan legal currency notes in Peiping are equivalent to 500 yuan of United Reserve Bank notes, which is the most common payment tool for daily life. In the future, 100-yuan and 10-yuan United Reserve Bank notes will decrease daily due to the exchange, then at least five times the 100-yuan legal currency notes will circulate in the market, and its banknote prices will definitely affect finance. As for the issuance and circulation of the puppet United Reserve Bank, according to the reporter's investigation, the total amount issued by its head office and branch bank vault, a total of 190 billion, is mostly circulated in Hebei, especially Peiping and Tianjin, followed by Shandong, then Shanxi, and the least in Henan. There are more in cities than in rural areas. Its reserve fund is calculated based on 170,000 taels of gold and a small amount of silver. According to the current price, it accounts for one-tenth of its issuance amount. It is also learned that the Peiping-Tianjin area is the first phase of the exchange of puppet United Reserve Bank notes. Ji and Jin can only be processed after order is stable.</p>

<h3>A Record of Walking Around Pengcheng (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>Xuzhou is the ancient Pengcheng. King Huai of Chu once moved his capital here from Yuyi. At that time, Xiang Liang was fighting Zhang Han, breaking through Dingtao, and besieging Yanggu. Qin sent reinforcements to counterattack, and the Chu army was defeated. Liang died, and the Chu generals Xiang Ji and Liu Bang were engaging in Chenliu. They then led their troops eastward, and Chu moved its capital north, which was an active measure to reorganize the declining situation in military and political affairs. In the second year of Chu-Han, Xiang Ji attacked Qi, and Liu Bang came out of Hanzhong with 560,000 soldiers of the lords, attacking Pengcheng and holding a grand banquet. Xiang Ji personally led 30,000 troops, starting from Yutai in Lu, reaching Xiaoxian, circling around Pengcheng. The Han army heard of it and was defeated. More than 200,000 people died entering the Gu, Si, and Sui rivers, and Liu Bang himself was almost captured. According to historical records: there was a great wind and darkness, the Chu army was in chaos, and Bang escaped.</p>
<p>Looking back at the great battle of Xuzhou seven years ago, the Japanese invaders also moved around Xuzhou from our right wing, encircling it. However, the scale was unprecedented in the history of warfare. Xuzhou fell on May 19, 1938. A large group of reporters broke through with the army, and the shadows of the flames of war are still vivid. When I, the reporter, returned to this land and got off the train, I only saw cattle, horses, and donkey carts under the dim light. With large armies gathered and strict guards, I still felt the pressing war intent of this ancient battlefield. I stayed in Xuzhou for several days and visited various parties, but due to the hurried pace, I could only record my impressions.</p>
<p>Currently, the Jinpu railway north of Xuzhou is still not open, but eastward to Lianyungang and westward to Kaifeng, passenger and freight transportation is very normal every day. A special express train will also be opened between Bian and Kaifeng soon. The Linzao branch line is repaired and then cut off. It is said that there is a force of the Eighth Division of the New Fourth Army near Linyi. When asked when the train could cross Lincheng and go north, the military and railway authorities made no statement.</p>
<p>The Jinpu railway was originally uniformly dispatched by the Jinpu Railway Bureau. After the Japanese invaders occupied it, they used Cao Lao Ji as the boundary. The north was operated by Mantetsu (South Manchuria Railway), and the south belonged to the Central China Railway Company. When we took over, we also proceeded according to the two systems of North and Central China. However, for the convenience of management, the Puxu section was extended to Yangqi outside Xuzhou, and the Puxu Section Management Office was established. Xuzhou is the Xuzhou Railway Bureau, with its jurisdiction extending north to Yanzhou, east to Lianyungang, and west to Yangji, west of Dangshan. In the future, when the takeover is completed and order is fully restored, it will need to be readjusted. In any case, Xuzhou will still be the hub connecting the Jinpu and Longhai railways, and the center for the distribution of merchants and goods. Looking forward to the future of peace and national construction, Xuzhou undoubtedly has its new mission. The following lists the agricultural products transported from Xuzhou each year before the war, which were sold in various places in Beijing and Shanghai (in tons):</p>
<p>Peanut kernels 24,000 Watermelon seeds 10,000</p>
<p>Soybeans 20,000 Wheat 100,000</p>
<p>Golden needles 600</p>
<p>As for livestock products, 10,000 yellow wolf skins, 8,000 dan of cowhide, and 5,000 dan of sheepskin were transported to Beijing and Shanghai annually. A large quantity of sorghum wine was concentrated in Donghai and shipped to Qingdao and Shanghai. According to Donghai statistics, it reached 800,000 dan annually. The importance of Xuzhou's commercial transportation can be seen in general.</p>
<p>In the past, freight transportation on the Jinpu line accounted for 70%, and passenger transportation accounted for 30%. According to current statistics, freight transportation only accounts for 30%. This figure is an indicator of the order of local production. As for the current transportation capacity, taking the 107 locomotives received in the Puxu section as an example, it has exceeded half of what it had before the war.</p>
<p>The Japanese invaders obviously operated Xuzhou with the purpose of military control and economic exploitation. I, the reporter, have a deep impression of the architecture in the Xuzhou urban area. The roads are as wide as those in Nanjing, and the houses are mostly built of reinforced concrete, and they are mostly in the "точка" (pillbox) style, with gun holes as dense as honeycombs, full of war intent. Compared with the old and simple old city area around the Xima Terrace, I deeply feel the great terror of the aggressors. Their construction focus was on transportation, to strengthen their occupation of points to meet military needs. I, the reporter, visited the Zifang Mountain tunnel, which had two automatic thousand-door telephone switchboards and a 250-kilowatt wireless radio station. There was also a railway hospital, covering an area of ​​100 mu, with no less than thousands of beds, comparable to another field hospital in the suburbs. The equipment included a complete laboratory that could perform various biochemical tests. The president of the hospital, Japanese Dr. Yokota, is still retained. According to what he told me, he is cultivating penialin. Climbing Yunlong Mountain, you can overlook the urban area of ​​Xuzhou, with barracks lined up. In addition to the four barracks in the southeast, northwest, and north, there are also urban barracks. Judging from the architecture, each barracks can accommodate a division. What is noteworthy is that the staff dormitory of the Jinpu Road is the same in size and layout as the barracks. Looking at it from a high place, it is not easy to distinguish them.</p>
<p>I, the reporter, talked about this with a trustworthy businessman. He said, "Those Japanese lads are not bad. They don't smoke or drink, and they build houses and roads every day." It seemed that after the restoration, this kind of construction project had stopped, and some extravagant new phenomena were not liked by the northern people. I, the reporter, felt deeply worried when I heard this.</p>
<p>The Japanese invaders' publicly stated plan was to build a city with a population of 500,000. The first phase of the plan, the setting of road zoning, ended last year and entered the second phase. According to Japanese statistics, the population last year reached 200,000, with more than 13,000 Japanese residents. Compared with 1938, it increased by one-third, which was due to the expansion of construction projects and the absorption of a large amount of labor. Many enlightened people shouted loudly: "Don't just look at the surface, the current Xuzhou is built with the blood and flesh of the Chinese people!"</p>
<p>There are indeed many buildings in Xuzhou, but the housing shortage is still serious. The reason is mainly due to uneven distribution and abuse. There are many units of troops entering and passing through Xuzhou, each with a communication office or garrison office, or even other names. This may be a factual need, but what I, the reporter, saw was that each unit occupied a large Western-style building, and some officers even occupied Western-style houses, marked at the door with "Residence of the Director of So-and-so," and stamped with the unit number. After Gu Zhutong, the director of the Pacification Headquarters, arrived, he stated that no more communication offices would be allowed below the army, but the rectification of discipline must be based on learning from the past to avoid future mistakes, and not just start with new regulations. Because the army needs barracks, Xuzhou established a Barracks Allocation Committee to coordinate housing. All those occupied by the enemy and puppets could be allocated, putting the property rights of the people second. However, the people returning to their hometowns to visit their homes are coming from the Longhai Railway in an endless stream. They are running around and appealing to all parties, but no signs have been seen. Generally speaking, the reception order in Xuzhou is not as good as in Beijing and Shanghai. It is said that Haizhou is far inferior to Xuzhou. The reasons for these shortcomings are very complicated, but ultimately, they are nothing more than issues of authority, responsibility, and personnel. The failure to make timely decisions at the time of reception, and subsequent remedies, may not be too late, but it is ultimately a regret. For example, in the banking sector, no personnel have been seen to take over, and the conversion of puppet currency has not yet begun. As for the Korean Bank Building on Qiming Road, it is not known which party took over. The building is now used by an unrelated agency. The reception personnel of the Ministry of Social Affairs arrived in Xuzhou relatively late, and there is nothing left to take over. The whereabouts of the materials related to the cooperative business are unknown, and the accounts have been destroyed, making handling difficult. These phenomena only reflect a part of the whole picture. In the future, the task of promoting righteousness and suppressing evil is important. Xuzhou is a transportation hub, and the focus of attention is on actively building the country. The Japanese invaders ruled the Xuzhou area, marking the so-called "Independent Administration of Northern Jiangsu." Initially, the Puppet Northern Jiangsu Administrative Commissioner's Office was established, governing 22 counties in Northern Jiangsu. Later, it was changed to the "Huaihai Special Zone Administrative Commissioner's Office." Before the Japanese surrender, it was changed to "Huaihai Province," replacing the puppet Hao Peng with Hao Pengju. These two people have the same surname and similar names. The people of Northern Jiangsu sarcastically said, "Replacing Peng with Peng, why bother?" This is the essence of "independence"! It is actually a euphemism for the special control of the Mantetsu financial clique. It is said that there are as many as 39 large and small factories in Xuzhou, mostly processing agricultural products, including alcohol, flour, oil, leather, soap, gauze, glass, brewing, and bricks. There is an alcohol factory that has not been completed and put into operation in Liuquan, which can go east to Jiawang, where the famous Jiawang Coal Mine is located. Before the war, it sold 150,000 tons annually along the Yangtze River. Now, the output of the mine is extremely low. As for the above-mentioned factories, the phenomenon of stopping work after reception is similar to other places. According to what Mayor Luo Dongfan told me, the municipal government plans to ask the authorities to have these factories operated by local and central governments according to their nature. However, when asked about the specific situation of the 39 factories, most senior officials in Xuzhou could not explain it in detail, but they only knew that after they closed down and stopped work, the situation did not seem to be very good.</p>

<h3>The Future Destiny of Mankind is at Stake The United Nations General Assembly Opens The representatives of 51 countries attended more than 2,000 people</h3>
<p>[Our report] London broadcast on the 9th: In a few hours, the United Nations General Assembly will open. This meeting is the highest peak of various meetings between countries in recent years. Its success or failure is related to the future destiny of mankind. In addition to resolving difficulties and disputes, the conference will also lay the foundation for permanent peace and ensure that the scourge of war never recurs. In view of this, the King of England will host a banquet for all United Nations representatives at St. James's Palace tonight. US Secretary of State Burns and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky arrived in time to participate, which added a lot of color to the conference.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, January 9] Tomorrow is the 26th anniversary of the founding of the League of Nations in Versailles. The United Nations is meeting on this day, which can be described as a coincidence.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, January 9] Representatives from the 51 member states of the United Nations have almost all arrived in London. The King of England and Prime Minister Attlee are preparing to hold a grand welcome party. Tomorrow morning, the greatest peace-making conference in history will be grandly opened in the Central Building of Westminster. Nearly 2,000 representatives from various countries have arrived in London, some of whom have never been here since the outbreak of the war. Therefore, special guides and interpreters have been assigned to facilitate them. About 400 journalists from various countries have arrived here. The authorities have allocated 70 telephones specifically for journalists to use.</p>
<p>Atomic Issues The United States and the United Kingdom Take the Same Attitude</p>
<p>[United Press, London, January 8] US Secretary of State Burns arrived by plane at 2:00 pm today. When meeting with reporters from various countries, he said: After the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, the issue of security guarantees for atomic bombs will be the focus of the meeting. He is convinced that a satisfactory solution can be negotiated by all countries. There is a danger of division into two factions within the US representative country on the issue of keeping the basic secrets of atomic energy. One faction believes that the US proposal to the United Nations General Assembly to establish an atomic energy management committee may inevitably leak secrets in the wording of the proposal, so there is concern. It is believed that this opposition situation in the US delegation can also be resolved satisfactorily, that is, the establishment of the committee will also take into account safety. The United Kingdom also takes the same attitude on this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, January 9] US Secretary of State Burns made a statement in Washington on Monday, saying that the United States may use its veto power when organizing the proposed atomic bomb control committee to protect its own interests. This statement has caused considerable tension in all aspects. Burns arrived in London yesterday, which may help to clear up this tense situation. The agreement established by the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers to organize the Atomic Energy Control Committee has a provision that "investigates all aspects of the issue." US personnel once feared the intention of this wording, believing that the United States should provide all secrets about the atomic bomb to other powerful countries. Some US representatives who have arrived in London also have some misunderstandings about the wording of the Moscow Communiqué on the atomic energy agreement, so they have expressed that such wording should be revised.</p>
<p>Agenda of the General Assembly Resolve Five Issues First</p>
<p>[United Press, London, January 9] The focus of the issues to be discussed at the General Assembly is the control of atomic energy. In addition, there are the following five major issues: (1) The Security Council, with the five countries of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France as permanent members, also needs to elect six small countries as non-permanent members. The United States is responsible for the Western Hemisphere to be elected by Canada, Brazil, and Mexico. The remaining three countries are approximately like Egypt, the Netherlands, and Poland. However, after Canada is elected, Australia will have no hope of being elected, and disputes may arise between the two parties. (2) Elect the Secretary-General and staff of the General Assembly. (3) Whether a trusteeship committee should be established to manage the mandated territories of the First World War. This will be an issue between the United States and the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The United Kingdom and the United States are responsible for organizing a temporary committee in accordance with the former League of Nations mandate system, and advocate organizing a permanent committee from the beginning. (4) Whether the United Nations will immediately find a way to settle refugees in the world's war-stricken areas. This incident will force the General Assembly to discuss the issue of Jewish immigrants in Pakistan. British Foreign Secretary Bevan once said that he urgently wanted the United Nations to discuss this issue. (5) The issue of the permanent site of the United Nations General Assembly. The Preparatory Committee has suggested that it be located in New York and Boston. Some people believe that China and Australia will insist that the site should be located in San Francisco.</p>
<h3>Behind-the-Scenes Activities of Representatives of Various Countries Worth Noting Tricky Issues Avoided Open Discussion France Will Be Personally Led By De Gaulle</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, January 7] January this year will be an important January in international relations. This is not only because the United Nations agency was established in London, but also because the foreign ministers and senior political figures of various countries gathered here, which will provide a great opportunity to conduct informal "behind-the-scenes" discussions. Informed sources predict that this kind of informal consultation will have a greater impact than the formal discussions of the United Nations General Assembly, especially on European relations. All major countries are extremely eager for the United Nations agencies to maintain the greatest possible harmony and unity in their deliberations. Therefore, any issues that may cause controversy and are tricky may not be raised in the United Nations General Assembly. The relationship between Suez and Su-Turkey is two tricky issues. The United Nations General Assembly stipulates that any international discussion items can be submitted to the agenda before midnight on the 4th, and will not be accepted after the deadline. The Turkish-Iranian delegation did not submit its issues to the General Assembly and include them in the discussion agenda. It is rumored that the reason why Turkey and Iran did not submit the above-mentioned two issues to the General Assembly was due to the powerful and informal opposition of the US government. The US government is adamant that no issues that may cause discord between the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union should be discussed at the time of the establishment of the United Nations agency. However, some European issues are still extremely tricky. London has expressed considerable anxiety about the tense relationship between Suez and Su-Turkey in the past few days. The United Kingdom claims that its major interests are involved in these two issues, which will affect its "lifeline" to India and the Far East. The Spanish issue will also be raised for discussion. It is reported that the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France may work to coordinate the policies of the three countries towards the West.</p>
<h3>Han Wants to Cancel The Trusteeship Resolution The Korean Delegation in Chongqing Cables Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, January 9] The Korean Provisional Government delegation in Chongqing today cabled the British Foreign Secretary Bevan, US Secretary of State Burns, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, requesting the cancellation of the decision on the five-year trusteeship of Korea in the Moscow Conference. The telegram stated that otherwise, "We will fight to the death, we can never accept it." The telegram to Molotov pointed out that Lenin recognized the Korean Provisional Government in 1920, and Stalin reaffirmed the independence of Korea at the Tehran Conference.</p>
<h3>The US President Hosts Reporters Reports on the International Situation Expresses Satisfaction with the Achievements of the Moscow Conference The United States Recognizes Southern Romania with Conditions</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, January 8] President Truman announced at a press conference today that he was satisfied with the communiqué and the achievements of the three foreign ministers announced at the recent Moscow Conference. When answering questions, the president stated that he had fully approved the agreement reached in Moscow regarding the occupation of Japan. He said that he had always supported the establishment of a Japanese Advisory Committee, and the Allied forces should also have the right to establish this committee. A reporter asked what criticism the president had of Burns' statement yesterday on the international control of atomic energy. The president replied that Burns' statement had made a detailed and complete discussion of the issue. The President replied to another question, stating that the planned Atomic Energy Commission would only be for the consultation of United Nations representatives, and this matter would be submitted to Congress for discussion. The President also stated that the Atomic Energy Commission would propose legislation in the United States to control atomic energy, and the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission would make the issue of international control of atomic energy reach a conclusion that satisfies everyone. Asked if Burns' statement would satisfy those who had expressed doubts about the issue of self-defense and international control of atomic bombs? The President replied in the affirmative, saying that this was the intention of Burns' statement. When asked what criticism the President had of the suggestion published in the Washington Post that the United States should immediately stop manufacturing atomic bombs, the President gave a negative answer.</p>
<p>Balkan Issues When discussing the Balkan issue, Truman said that according to today's New York Times, constructive results have been achieved in Romania. A reporter asked what plans the government had regarding the recognition of the governments of Romania and Bulgaria. Truman emphasized that unless the governments of these countries have the guarantee of free and unsuppressed elections as stipulated in the Yalta Conference, the United States will not recognize them.</p>
<p>A reporter pointed out that although the recent elections in Yugoslavia were not a true expression of the people's wishes, the United States had already recognized the Yugoslav government. The President replied that the recognition of the Yugoslav government was conditional, and it is still a conditional recognition. He said that recognition was necessary under the prevailing circumstances, but the United States hoped to see progress in the situation in Yugoslavia. Another reporter asked what criticism there was regarding the dispatch of ambassadors to Moscow and Rome.</p>
<p>The President said that Ambassador Harriman intended to resign after the surrender of Germany, but he agreed to continue working, which was commendable. He said that he had urged Ambassador Harriman to remain in his position and hoped that Ambassador Harriman would not resign again. The situation in Rome was the same as before.</p>
<p>Indian Immigration to the United States Finally, when asked about the issue of Indian immigration, Truman answered in the affirmative that he supported allowing Indians to immigrate to the United States, with the same quota as Chinese immigrants. According to reports, the House of Representatives passed a bill last October allowing 100 Indians to immigrate to the United States each year, and allowing approximately 4,000 Indians currently in the United States to be naturalized.</p>
<h3>There is a Theory that the Soviet Union Has Atomic Bombs The US President Has Not Heard of It</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, January 9] President Truman stated at a press conference yesterday that he had no knowledge of the claim by the London Terry news that the Soviet Union has an atomic bomb that is far more powerful than those possessed by the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, Terry, January 9] Dr. Anmaito, a British scientist, said that the Soviet Union has a newer type of atomic bomb than the United Kingdom and the United States. President Truman denied this yesterday. Our reporter asked Dr. An for this. He replied, "Bismarck once said that political remarks are not true unless they are denied. Future remarks should come from the Soviet authorities. Only facts can prove whether President Du's words are true. This question should be asked of the Kremlin, not the White House. Then President Du can know whether his belief that the Soviet Union does not have atomic bombs is true."</p>
<h3>Soviet Officers Arrive in Seoul in Snow Carrying Official Letters They Have Contact with Hodge</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, January 9] Several Soviet officers arrived here today in two small planes in the snow. It is reported that the Soviet officers carried an official letter from Lieutenant General Chistyakov, commander of the Soviet army in northern Korea, to Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US army in southern Korea, regarding the address of the meeting between the US and Soviet occupation forces authorities.</p>
<h3>Viet Minh Gains Popular Support</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, January 9] The preliminary results of the general election in Vietnam show that the Viet Minh has gained the support of the people of Vietnam and has won. The Vietnamese government has scheduled to convene the All-Vietnam National Congress on March 3.</p>
<h3>Shidehara Cabinet Prepares for Resignation; Forming a Coalition Government; Liberal Party's Ichiro Hatoyama to Become Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 9th] It is heard that the Shidehara Cabinet intends to collectively submit its resignation, yielding to the more capable to rise and form a new coalition government. The candidate to succeed as Prime Minister was revealed this morning: Ichiro Hatoyama, leader of the Liberal Party, who has been attempting to overthrow the current cabinet. According to the Mainichi Shimbun, the strongest proponents of the cabinet's resignation are Nara Hashimoto, Director-General of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, and Hitoshi Ashida, Minister of Health and Welfare, both members of the Liberal Party. Should the Shidehara Cabinet resign en masse, Hatoyama is prepared to succeed in forming a cabinet. However, it is widely believed that the Liberal Party under his leadership may not be sufficient to shoulder this responsibility alone. The Social Democratic Party, thus far, seems to be responding to the Liberal Party's actions, so Hatoyama will likely invite that party to cooperate. Hatoyama has now begun discussions with various leaders to select them for cabinet positions when the Shidehara Cabinet resigns en masse. (Editor's Note: Ichiro Hatoyama was born in Tokyo in 1883, is 63 years old, and is the current president of the Liberal Party of Japan. He is a lawyer and a leading figure in Japanese liberalism. He has served as a member of the House of Representatives and in key government positions. He graduated from the Law Department of Tokyo Imperial University in 1907 and later served as Chairman of the Tokyo City Council, Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, and Executive Committee Member of the Seiyukai. In 1927, during the Tanaka Cabinet, he served as Chief Cabinet Secretary. Before the outbreak of the war of aggression, he opposed the militaristic actions of the warlords during parliamentary inquiries into the war, which caused a great uproar. His recommendation by Prime Minister Shidehara to lead the Japanese cabinet is clear evidence that the liberal faction is about to rise, and it is expected that Hatoyama will cooperate with the socialist faction to overcome the difficulties in the Japanese political situation.)</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 9th] Well-informed sources in Japanese political circles claim that there is a strong possibility of forming a coalition government after the upcoming general election in Japan. Observers say that if none of the four major parties wins a significant victory, this possibility will likely become a reality. The so-called four major parties are the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Communist Party. Members of each party have already begun to consider what policies they will follow if a coalition government is proposed. The election was originally scheduled for January 20th, but has been postponed due to MacArthur's recent "purge" directive and the crisis facing the cabinet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] The Asahi Shimbun reported today that approximately 200 judges and prosecutors will be forced to resign due to MacArthur's recent directive, including some members of the Supreme Court and key officials from the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice will convene a meeting of key officials on the 11th and 12th of this month to discuss the resignations. Judges and prosecutors from the Supreme Court, eight high courts nationwide, and 52 district courts will be affected. Normally, Japanese judges have lifetime tenure.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] According to a report by Kyodo News this morning, officials and employees of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry are demanding that Japanese government agencies be thoroughly "democratized." This demand, made by civil servants themselves, is unprecedented.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] The Asahi Shimbun reported today that as a result of MacArthur's recent directive, two major figures in the Japanese business community have decided to resign: Matsumoto, Chairman of the Economic Federation and the Major Industries Committee, and Fujiyama, Chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Meanwhile, Godo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Associations, the fourth largest economic group in Japan, was previously arrested as a war crimes suspect.</p>
<h3>Truman Issues Statement Regarding U.S. Military Demobilization Requests; Demonstrations by U.S. Troops in Yokohama and Honolulu</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] President Truman declared at a press conference today that the delay in army demobilization is due to the urgent need for troops around the world. The efficiency of demobilization for the army and navy since its inception has been commendable, and it has been fair to all parties. As for soldiers complaining about demobilization, it must be understood that the reduction of the army has been proceeding as quickly as possible, but for various reasons, it has not been possible to quickly discharge everyone. The United States faces a difficult task and must bear full responsibility for maintaining peace and destroying the enemy's war potential so that war does not rise again. Demobilization is not an arbitrary action, but an inevitable part of the nation's efforts to fulfill its obligations during the difficult postwar period. The future of the United States is still precarious, no different from wartime, so we must do everything we can to lay a solid foundation for the future peace of the world. Judging from the number of people demobilized from the army, navy, and overseas forces, it is a miracle, not that some army and navy soldiers have not yet returned home, but that so many soldiers have already returned home.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] President Truman's secretary, Patterson, presented the President with a stack of papers six inches thick, reportedly signed by 30,000 American soldiers in the Philippines, protesting the army's demobilization policy. The petition was mailed to the United States and included the slogan "No Ships, No Votes" before the signatures.</p>
<p>Near Mutiny [United Press, Yokohama, 9th] U.S. Military Police Commander Colonel Mahoney announced today that a portion of the U.S. Eighth Army troops shouted "We want to go home" when welcoming Army Secretary Patterson yesterday. This situation was close to mutiny and was dispersed by him. He also gave a short speech to the offending soldiers, severely criticizing them. Today, an unsigned mimeographed pamphlet called "Discharge" was found among the soldiers, accusing Mahoney of insulting the soldiers as "bastards." The pamphlet also announced that a mass meeting would be held in front of the Eighth Army Headquarters at 5:30 p.m. on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 9th] 1,500 American soldiers here also held a rally today to protest the delay in demobilization. The atmosphere was boisterous, but order was maintained. The meeting decided to send a telegram to President Truman. Speakers criticized Army Secretary Patterson's demobilization process and various State Department policies. Prior to this, Lieutenant General Richardson, commander of U.S. forces in the Central Pacific, warned his subordinates not to take any "foolish actions," but to no avail.</p>
<h3>U.S. Invites Soviet Union to Participate in Far Eastern Commission; U.S. and Chinese Delegations Arrive in Yokohama</h3>
<p>[United Press, Yokohama, 9th] The U.S. delegation to the Far Eastern Advisory Commission arrived here today aboard the U.S. ship "McKinley." After unloading its cargo, the ship will sail to Tokyo to serve as the headquarters for the Advisory Commission. According to U.S. representative McCoy, the U.S. State Department invited the Soviet Union two days ago to send a representative to the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, and is now awaiting a reply. We have come here to discuss and examine the situation with MacArthur to help the Allied nations that participated in the war against Japan to ensure that Japan fulfills the terms of surrender. Participating countries should also jointly determine future policies toward Japan. We are well aware that participating countries are deeply satisfied with the occupation of Japan and the various policies implemented by MacArthur.</p>
<p>[United Press, Yokohama, 9th] Lieutenant General Zhu Shimin, the chief representative of the Chinese delegation to the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, also arrived here today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Yokohama, 9th] Major General McCoy, Chairman of the Far Eastern Commission, revealed here today that the State Department in Washington had again invited the Soviet Union to participate in the work of the Far Eastern Commission two days ago.</p>
<h3>Japanese Women Representatives Demand Suffrage</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tokyo, 9th] A delegation of Japanese women today visited the Allied Headquarters and stated: "The election is approaching, which will be the first opportunity for Japanese women to elect government officials. Candidates should be non-discriminatory in terms of gender and should belong to those who have worked to eliminate feudal remnants." The statement was signed by Mrs. Saito of the Socialist Party and others.</p>
<h3>Lifting of Restrictions on Italian Funds in Japan</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tokyo, 9th] The Japanese government ordered on the 9th to lift the restrictions on the funds of the Italian government deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, to be used by the Italian embassy for staff salaries, to maintain Italian property rights, and to provide for Italian residents.</p>

<h3>U.S. Atomic Experts Organize; Federation of American Scientists; Creating Large-Scale Educational Program for the Welfare of the Public and the Nation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th Dispatch] The majority of atomic experts, who actively advocate international control of atomic energy based on full cooperation with the United Nations, have successfully organized a national association of scientists, called the Federation of American Scientists, to create a large-scale public education program to regulate scientific research on atomic energy, etc. The federation has 2,500 individual members, and various groups composed of individuals who have contributed to the manufacture and research of atomic bombs, radar, and other secret weapons are the organizational constituents of the federation. The federation will participate in active political work aimed at conducting scientific education for the public and the welfare of the nation, and will use its power to influence legislation related to scientific education. The federation's headquarters will be located in Washington.</p>
<h3>How Dreadful! The Power of the Atomic Bomb; No Grass Will Grow in Hiroshima This Spring; Nagasaki Only Shows Scrap Metal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch] Unless one has experienced the atomic bomb explosions in Hiroshima or Nagasaki, it is difficult to understand the absolute dreadfulness of the atomic bomb, and even harder to believe that a single bomb could inflict such great destruction on a city. It has been seven months since Hiroshima was bombed, yet people are still dying from the effects of the atomic bomb explosion, and no green grass will grow in Hiroshima this spring. The destruction in Nagasaki is similar to that in Hiroshima, and it is fortunate that the surrounding mountains served as a barrier, but rows of scrap metal can be seen in the factories, and the factory foundations are tilted and cannot be restored to their original positions due to the impact. The mountains of Nagasaki insulated the power of the atomic bomb, preventing other parts of the city from being affected, but as a result, the foothills were almost uprooted. Statistics show that in Hiroshima alone, the number of people killed, injured, and missing due to the atomic bomb reached 130,000, and 49,727 buildings were damaged. In one affected area, the circumference of the damage reached four kilometers in diameter. The extent of the damage in Nagasaki was less severe, with 66,144 people killed, injured, and missing, and 19,587 buildings damaged. According to Hiroshima Mayor Kihara, the reconstruction of Hiroshima is still being planned, but even the planning itself will take six months to complete. The destroyed area still looks as it did five months ago, with only a few simple dwellings hastily built to protect against the cold winter. The reporter then said, then how will Nanjing and Manila be rebuilt?</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Songjiang: Announcement of Temporary Councilors</p>
<p>Having received a telegram from the province to organize a temporary county council, the county government convened a second consultation meeting on the 7th, and decided on all the qualified candidates: Zhang Zhuocheng and ten others from the urban area, six each from Sijing, Fengjing, and Zhu Yushu, four each from Tiankun, Tinglin, Ye Lan, and Caojing, and sixteen professional candidates including Zhu Yian.</p>
<p>Changshu: Changtai Ferry Plundered by Bandits</p>
<p>The ferry operating between Shaxi Town in Taicang and Changshu was plundered by bandits near Dongtang City the day before yesterday. Six bandits, armed with two Mauser pistols, claimed to be conducting an inspection and ordered the ship to stop, robbing passengers of cash, clothing, and accessories, with a loss of approximately six million legal tender.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Soliciting Proposals for the Business Association Congress</p>
<p>The various industry guilds in Wu County publicly recommended Fan Junbo, the current chairman of the county's Chamber of Commerce reorganization committee, to attend the National Business Association Congress. The Chamber of Commerce believes that in order to restore pre-war commercial normality, business people should bear a major mission. Yesterday, it circulated a notice to various industries, limiting them to submit all proposals to the association before the 12th of this month, so that they can be organized and submitted to the conference in the accompanying capital by Representative Fan for discussion at the conference.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Actively Repairing Highway Transportation</p>
<p>Before the war, the highways in this county, such as the Xihu, Xicheng, Xiyi, and Suxi main lines, were intact. Merchants and travelers from all over the world could travel from morning to night, which was very convenient. During the war, the roads and bridges on various highways were destroyed by the enemy and puppets. After the victory, they were destroyed again by bandits, and transportation on various roads could not be quickly restored. The Third Front Army and the Jiangsu Provincial Government are actively repairing the highways north and south of the Yangtze River, and limited the start of construction to December 16th of last year, and the completion of the repairs before January 10th of this year. Among them, the Xicheng Highway has been repaired and opened to traffic by the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company. The Suxi Road has also been repaired by two-thirds, with only a few bridges waiting to be repaired. The road from Wuxi to Yixing was also repaired the week before, and cars can now travel on it. Regarding the Shanghai-Nanjing National Highway, the section from Shanghai via Suzhou, Wuxi, to Wujin, and the section from Zhenjiang via Jurong to Nanjing, have been repaired. The section from Wujin via Jintan Danyang to Zhenjiang will also be repaired and opened to traffic before the 10th of this month. From then on, the highway from Shanghai to Nanjing, more than 400 kilometers long, will be unimpeded.</p>
<p>Haizhou: Bandit Troops Drive Women and Children Away from Their Homes</p>
<p>The villages in the two counties of Hai and Gan, and the two counties of Dongzhu, have long been occupied by the majority of bandit troops, and the people are in deep water. In recent months, the pressure of the bandits on the people has become even more intense. Now they are even implementing their poisonous methods of sealing up, and the property and houses of all those who are wandering outside are sealed up, and their families are driven out of the bandit area. All the women and children in the bandit area, unable to bear the abuse of the bandit troops, resolutely abandoned everything and fled to the recovered area, which also shows the people's attitude towards the bandit troops.</p>
<p>Pinghu: Frequent Robberies, Troops Sent to Suppress</p>
<p>Since the New Year, robbery cases by bandits have occurred frequently in the suburbs of this county. The machine boat that opened from Ping to Jiashan Xitang was ambushed by bandits hidden in the boat near the Catholic Church the morning before, and they robbed at will, with a loss of 100 million yuan. Yesterday, five or six people in grass-green uniforms, armed with guns, suddenly shouted to lean against the boat after the paddling boat that opened from Fengjing to Ping Shaoxing arrived at the port. As a result, the men's and women's clothing and accessories and cash were robbed. The authorities have sent Wang Hu's troops to set out to suppress the bandits according to the opportunity.</p>
<p>Wuhu: Founding Anhui Tea Company</p>
<p>Anhui's production is dominated by rice tea. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was hijacked by the enemy and puppets, and production and sales were greatly damaged. Now, Xu Shiying and others from Anhui in the accompanying capital have founded the Anhui Tea Company, raising a capital of 200 million yuan, and appointed Han Junheng as the general manager, and hired experts Hu Haochuan Fang Junqiang as design commissioners. Han has arrived in Wuhu from Chongqing to prepare for the establishment of an office. The main company plans to set up in Shanghai, and factories will be set up in the tea-producing areas of Huizhou and Liuan. In addition to exporting abroad and selling domestically, planned improvements will be made to production and baking.</p>

<h3>Adapting to Domestic and International Realities: Britain Implements Austerity Policies</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in Britain, Xu Chengbin, reporting for this newspaper</p>
<p>Whenever eating is mentioned in Britain, everyone's spirits dampen. After six years of war, the food situation has worsened, and friends often complain. "During the London Blitz, shops had wine and meat, but we were too busy to enjoy it. Now that the war is over, we should be able to relax, but everything is still restricted." This is the truth. In terms of clothing and food, victory has not loosened the grip of control, and old ladies who hoped to return to their old lives already realize their expectations were wrong. When the clothing coupons for the second half of the year were issued in September, everyone thought that with the war over, more coupons would be issued, but instead, the twenty-four coupons used for six months during the war (not enough to buy a set of clothes) now have to last eight months. There may be hope for an increase next summer, but it is definitely impossible at present.</p>
<p>**U.S. Dollar Exchange for Military Supplies Leaves National Treasury Empty**</p>
<p>The post-war economic difficulties of Britain can be seen from clothing and food alone. For six years, industry was entirely devoted to military production, and the policy of balancing income and expenditure through exports could not be advanced. War expenses reached 5 billion pounds per year. Most of the U.S. dollar exchange was used for military supplies, and the national treasury is in an unprecedented state of depletion. According to the government's white paper, in the six years of the war, foreign assets amounting to 1.18 billion pounds had been sold off by the end of June this year, and in addition, there were more than 3.3 billion pounds of foreign debt, itemized as follows:</p>
<p>Sterling Area  Amount (in Pounds)</p>
<p>Dominions 384,000,000</p>
<p>India, Burma, and the Middle East 1,732,000,000</p>
<p>Other 607,000,000</p>
<p>Non-Sterling Area Amount (in Pounds)</p>
<p>North and South America 303,000,000</p>
<p>Europe 267,000,000</p>
<p>Other 62,000,000</p>
<p>Gold and U.S. dollar reserves, as of the end of October this year, amounted to only 453 million pounds. The imbalance between income and expenditure is very obvious. The only income during the war came from domestic taxes and public bonds, which in the final analysis, were still the people's own money and cannot be considered income. Inflation was avoided entirely due to effective control and the people's compliance with the law, but control cannot be maintained forever, and the people cannot wear patched socks forever. After the Labour Party came to power, the first difficulty was how to maintain prices, meet the needs of the people, increase production, and restore the economic advantages of the pre-war era. After calculating, the only way is to tighten the belt. Purchasing food overseas costs money and tonnage; relaxing controls on department stores would affect exports. The economic life of Britain originally depended on a few ships. The purpose of the ships is to transport goods abroad, and only by earning foreign exchange can they load goods back home. To load goods for export, the country can only implement austerity policies.</p>
<p>**U.S. Halts Lend-Lease Act, a Blow to Britain**</p>
<p>The economic sources during the war were nothing more than two: one was tax revenue, and the other was U.S. aid under the Lend-Lease Act. Not long after the end of the war, Washington issued a warning and immediately stopped the Lend-Lease Act, leaving British officials and the public feeling like they had been struck on the head. The seriousness of the problem was no less than during the most tense moments of the war. Temporarily, exaggerated rumors arose. Some said that the United States might not approve of the policies of the newly appointed Labour Party and was deliberately giving this warning. Others said that the United States wanted to dominate the world market and not allow other countries to compete; in any case, everyone felt that the Americans were not good friends. The reaction from Whitehall (i.e., the British government) was to immediately dispatch senior officials and experts to Washington to negotiate, while the temporary ambassador Halifax resumed his post, and at the same time, announced at home that it would intensify efforts to save U.S. dollars. For example, ships sailing to Australia and New Zealand would no longer take the Panama Canal but would rather detour around South America and travel more than two hundred miles, saving more than five million U.S. dollars in transit fees each year. In fact, although Britain is poor, it certainly is not too poor to pay the Panama Canal transit fees. This measure was simply an expression of dissatisfaction with Washington.</p>
<p>**Britain Opposes Open Competition and Refuses to Give Up its Privileges**</p>
<p>Washington's attitude is not difficult to understand. The Lend-Lease Act implemented the principle of "those with money give money, those with strength give strength" during the war, and it cannot continue to be maintained after the war. Conversely, lending money to others to do reconstruction work and restore the world market is beneficial to both parties, as long as the interest rates are negotiable. The Washington negotiations lasted for three months, and were suspended several times in between, but finally, as of this writing, they have been successfully concluded. Britain wants to borrow money, but is unwilling to pay interest, because it feels that it is beyond its ability. The American demand, according to the speculation in newspapers here, is to terminate the Imperial Preference system within the British Dominions. The sterling area is Britain's most stable market, and it is not easy for other countries to break into it. Although Canada is not within the sterling area, it also respects the imperial preference system. The United States is willing to lend money, but hopes that Britain will abandon this privilege, open the market in the Dominions, and engage in open competition. This is a condition that Britain absolutely cannot consider. Borrowing money with interest is already difficult, not to mention giving up the only market that it has a grip on. In fact, the economic situation of the British Empire is more difficult today than it has ever been in history. After many years of occupation, the countries of Western Europe have been stripped bare of domestic resources by the occupying powers. Their monetary systems are unstable, and their purchasing power is weak, making them unable to absorb British goods. The advantages in the Middle East that Britain previously had cannot be asserted today. The United States has already gained the upper hand in the Far Eastern market. The first batch of commercial goods arriving in Hong Kong after its liberation were American goods, and the ships carrying them were American ships. A British naval officer who personally witnessed the unloading of these goods immediately wrote to the editor of The Times of London, pointing out the unfavorable position of British commerce and proposing that the government send a senior official to be stationed in Hong Kong for a long time, holding the title of Cabinet member and specifically responsible for supervising Far Eastern commerce. The markets of Western Europe and the Far East have become problematic. If it abandons the market within the Empire, it would be tantamount to suicide. Washington also appreciates Britain's difficulties. After months of consultations, their views have become much closer. Although the United States insists on not waiving the 2% annual interest rate, it has agreed to waive interest when British commerce is in recession. This condition broke through everyone's difficulties.</p>
<p>**Obsolete Equipment and Low Production Are No Match for the United States**</p>
<p>The $4.4 billion loan cannot solve all the problems of reconstruction. Manpower, factory equipment, and the quality of products are all thorny issues. Several mining experts from the United States came in the first half of the year and studied Britain's equipment and production. They believed that it was too far behind and could not be compared with the United States. Obsolete equipment, low production, and high labor costs inevitably lead to high costs. This is the case in the mining industry, and the same is true for other industries, only to varying degrees. In terms of labor, the recent wave of strikes across the country reflects a fundamental problem in British industry.</p>
<p>This problem is also a natural consequence of the austerity policy. During the war, factories were taken over by the government to specialize in military supplies, and the income of ordinary workers far exceeded their normal income, in some cases by several times. After the war ended, factories resumed their pre-war operations, and employers wanted to abolish war-time allowances, which labor refused to accept. The negotiations became a stalemate, and the wave of strikes began. Two months ago, more than 40,000 dockworkers across the country went on strike, and ships waiting in the harbor could not unload, and the food being transported was in danger of rotting, affecting the distribution of food within the country. Seeing the seriousness of the situation, the government dispatched more than 10,000 soldiers to unload the goods, and the Ministry of Labor set up a special committee to mediate the dispute. The result of the mediation was that the union agreed to resume work first and then hold negotiations. As of this writing, the negotiations are still in progress. The workers are demanding a minimum wage of 25 shillings (equivalent to five U.S. dollars) per week, while the employers are willing to increase it to 19 shillings. What the outcome will be is unknown. Other railway and gas workers' slowdowns all stem from the same source. The workers' demands are not without reason. Prices are 40% higher than before the war, and income tax is high. Without a wage increase, they cannot make a living. The government's heavy income tax is also unavoidable. To suppress prices and maintain domestic economic balance, the only way is to ask the people for money. Workers demand wage increases because of high prices and heavy income tax, the government levies income tax to stabilize society, and employers refuse to raise wages in order to reduce costs and maintain old prices—this is a vicious circle, which the British call a Vicious Circle. It is not a problem that can be fundamentally resolved by any one party compromising.</p>
<p>**The Cost of Living is 40% Higher After the War Compared to Before**</p>
<p>The people who suffer the most from income tax are not the workers. Recently, Churchill attacked the government in Parliament, saying that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was incompetent and could not find a way to reduce the burden on the people. The income tax in Britain is the highest in the world. For those with an annual salary of more than 2,500 pounds, 19 shillings and 6 pence must be paid in income tax for every 20 shillings. Calculated this way, the actual difference between an annual salary of 5,000 pounds and 3,000 pounds is only 2,000 sixpences, equivalent to 50 pounds. Middle-class people with an annual salary of 400-500 pounds also have to pay a quarter of their income in income tax, and single people are taxed even more. Under wartime tax rates, single people have 80 pounds that are tax-free, and next year the marginal amount of 120 pounds before the war can be restored, but the cost of living before and after the war differs by at least 40% to 50%. Just for the sake of collecting income tax, the people have to automatically tighten their belts, and when other indirect taxes are added, the standard of living naturally drops a lot.</p>
<p>The government's policy of austerity on the people can be seen even more clearly in the recently announced interest rates. The interest rates on bank deposits in Britain are much lower than in the United States, and interest is unearned income, which is one of the items most heavily taxed by income tax. During the war, in order to promote savings and thrift, the government issued taxable bonds, divided into savings bonds and public bonds, with annual interest rates ranging from 2.5% to 3%. Savings bonds alone sold more than 300 million pounds, and over the six years of the savings movement, banks received deposits of more than 1 billion pounds. In the second half of the year's austerity plan, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the issuance of bonds with an annual interest rate of 3% would be stopped, and the interest on bonds that had not yet matured would be reduced. According to The Times, reducing the interest rate by half a percentage point would save 70 million pounds per year. If this money were not saved, it would only be domestic debt, which is not as serious as foreign debt. From this, we can see the scope of the austerity policies adopted by Britain.</p>
<p>**Britain Implements Control and Austerity Aimed at Two Major Goals**</p>
<p>All controls and austerity measures are aimed at two goals: one is to save foreign exchange, and the other is to export goods for sale abroad. Because it is necessary to save foreign exchange, imported goods such as food must be strictly controlled. Because it is necessary to export domestic products, domestic consumption must be tightened. The difficulties first encountered by British industry after the war can be illustrated by the automotive industry. The government taxes based on the number of cylinders, and the tax rate is so high that people in the country dare not even ask about it. At the same time, foreign markets have not yet recovered, there are no customers, and there is no way to promote exports. The automotive industry asked the government to reset the tax rates in the hope of restoring the domestic market, but the government refused to consider it. Recently, the President of the Board of Trade, Cripps, was a guest at the Federation of British Industries, and had a heated debate with the chairman, almost ending in a complete breakdown of relations. The government blamed the businessmen for only knowing how to make money and not understanding the country's difficulties, while the businessmen blamed the government for only planning to collect taxes and ignoring the businessmen's capital. The truth is that everyone has difficulties.</p>
<p>**Borrowing Money is Not a Good Solution; Not Borrowing Money is Even Worse**</p>
<p>"Taking on foreign debt and saving foreign exchange are only temporary measures and cannot be relied upon for long. The way for an industrial country to recover lies in revitalizing industry and increasing exports. One factor in revitalizing industry is manpower. At the current rate of demobilizing 12,000 people per month, British industry will only be able to restore half of its pre-war level this year, and whether it will be able to fully recover by next summer is a question. Secondly, the U.S. loan must begin to be paid off in five years. If industrial production does not exceed pre-war levels by 50% to 70%, there will be problems with the money to repay the debt. The White Paper estimates that the trade deficit for the coming year may reach 750 million pounds, which may be reduced to 500 million pounds in 1947 and 1948, and may be further reduced in 1949 and 1950. The total deficit within five years is projected to be no less than 1.25 billion pounds. This estimate was published before the U.S. loan was established. With the U.S. loan, financial circulation will be flexible, and economic life can be expected to recover at an accelerated pace.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opposition began to attack the conditions of the U.S. dollar loan. Some domestic experts believe that borrowing American money to buy American goods to get through the difficulties will lead to an even greater crisis in the future, especially since some of the conditions of the loan restrict the freedom of British commerce. Lord Keynes, the British economic representative in the United States, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton's explanations both contained endless bitterness: "We admit that the terms of the loan did not meet our wishes, but under the current circumstances, what we have won are the best terms." Borrowing money is not a good solution, and not borrowing money is an even worse solution.</p>
<h3>British Cargo Ship Arrives in Hong Kong for the First Time, Commodity Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent, Lin Youlan</p>
<p>Four Christmases ago, the people of Hong Kong hoped for Santa Claus to bring them a battleship. Four years later, the gift the people of Hong Kong are hoping for is a large cargo ship.</p>
<p>The "President Grant" arrived in Hong Kong last month, carrying the first batch of commercial goods since the war, including 2,500 tons of foreign wine, foreign boots, cosmetics, medicines, women's underwear, canned goods, grains, flour, apples, and California oranges… These are now precious items in department store windows, attracting the eyes of the general public. The fragrant apples appeared on the market that very evening, priced at six yuan per catty (before the war, each catty was only worth 60 to 80 cents). Lucky Shanghainese may taste this long-awaited delicacy before the people of Hong Kong. After the "President Grant", it is said that the "President Pierce" and "President Taft" are already loading goods on the west coast of the United States and will soon bring more goods to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The President Grant brought American goods (and another 1,500 tons of goods from Shanghai). This reminds us of the remarks made by Hong Kong Governor Vice Admiral Sir Cecil Harcourt to British and American reporters on the 12th. According to Associated Press reporter Ball, citing the Hong Kong government, "American ships and aircraft have complete freedom of movement in Chinese territorial waters, but the British do not have this right. Therefore, in terms of trade, the British seem to be at a disadvantage."</p>
<p>Vigorous Activities of American Merchants in Hong Kong</p>
<p>The Governor also said, "In Hong Kong, American merchants are very active because they feel that the security guarantees they can obtain in Hong Kong are far more long-term than those in Shanghai. In Shanghai, they are subject to tax restrictions imposed by the Chinese and local governments."</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation in Hong Kong, Harcourt said, "Hong Kong has gradually returned to its old appearance. Since the restoration, the price of food has fallen by 50%, but the supply is still insufficient. However, it must be admitted that Hong Kong will remain a burden on British taxpayers until industrial and commercial development is possible."</p>
<p>The Governor Revealed His Wish to Meet Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Harcourt said the following about the issue of Hong Kong's return to China: "We are very friendly with Chairman Chiang. I hope I will be able to meet with the Chairman soon." Harcourt continued, "Admiral Fraser will establish the British Pacific Fleet headquarters in Hong Kong, or at least temporarily establish the headquarters there. However, whether Britain will make Hong Kong or Singapore the main base of the British Pacific Fleet has not yet been decided."</p>
<p>Various Taxes Begin to Be Collected One After Another</p>
<p>Harcourt said, "Hong Kong is a burden on British taxpayers." This statement may require an explanation: Currently, Hong Kong is in a period of military and political—or rather, semi-civilian—administration, and various taxes have not yet been fully collected. The Hong Kong authorities' expenditures must rely on allocations from the British treasury. This is why the burden of Hong Kong's political expenses falls on the shoulders of British taxpayers. This, of course, cannot be accepted for long. The authorities have now issued successive announcements, declaring the commencement of the collection of various taxes, including entertainment tax, tobacco tax, alcohol tax, land tax, police fees, water fees, business license fees, and so on. The British Empire does not engage in loss-making business.</p>
<p>As Harcourt said, American commerce is very prosperous in Hong Kong, but British merchants are not necessarily standing idly by. The Hong Kong Economic Delegation initiated by the Civil Affairs Department of the Hong Kong Military Government departed for Australia on the 18th to purchase daily necessities and building materials. The delegation consists of five people, including two Chinese merchants, and is expected to stay in Australia for half a month. Therefore, it will not be long before Australian goods appear in the Hong Kong market after American goods.</p>
<p>Authorities Announce Measures for Opening Up Trade</p>
<p>The goods that Hong Kong currently lacks the most are clothing materials, wool felt, bedding, porcelain, and kitchen utensils. A month ago, the authorities announced the opening up of Hong Kong's trade and ordered importers and exporters to register. If the imported goods purchased by merchants are related to Hong Kong's reconstruction efforts, the government will provide convenience and issue foreign exchange specifically. However, one point must be noted: the amount of foreign currency stored within the pound sterling group is not large. US dollars, Canadian dollars, and Swiss francs are extremely difficult to obtain. Therefore, merchants must carefully consider their applications for foreign exchange, as they are not easily approved, as stated by Horace, the financial advisor to the Hong Kong Military Government.</p>
<p>Merchants cannot apply for US dollars and other foreign currencies, but they can apply for pounds sterling. Therefore, if they order goods from Britain and its territories, they will not have the trouble of the authorities' "careful consideration" in granting foreign exchange. In this regard, even if American merchants are active, they will not easily seize the British market.</p>
<p>Two Key Points Specified in the Prosperity Policy</p>
<p>Regarding the policy of prospering Hong Kong, the authorities have announced its two major points:</p>
<p>(1) It is necessary to have a low-cost service system in Hong Kong, such as low labor wages, cheap shipping costs, and port cargo handling fees.</p>
<p>(2) It is necessary to lower the standard of living in Hong Kong and strictly implement price controls (the authorities have already expressed disapproval of merchants selling the newly arrived American goods at high prices).</p>
<p>The authorities are asking merchants who previously traded in Hong Kong to return to Hong Kong from various places as soon as possible, and they also hope that other merchants will come to Hong Kong to start new businesses. They clearly stated that if Hong Kong's commerce shifts to other areas of development, it will not be easy to seek recovery in the future.</p>
<p>Two Tons of New Banknotes Airlifted from England to Hong Kong</p>
<p>The new Hong Kong banknotes printed in England, weighing two tons, have been airlifted to Hong Kong by the British Air Force. The people of Hong Kong also have new banknotes rustling in their pockets, and they do not have to envy the "straight-print Customs Gold Unit" in mainland China. Bank safe deposit boxes are also being processed for opening. Brilliant jewelry will soon reappear in the light of day, and valuable deeds or documents will not be locked in iron vaults for long. Houses and properties that have not changed hands or been traded during the Japanese occupation period can also be freely traded in the near future. Currently, the general public is looking forward to the "unfreezing" of pre-war bank deposits and the reinstatement of the "fifty, one hundred, and five hundred dollar banknotes that the Japanese forced British bank officials to sign and issue." However, the authorities stated that this will have to wait until Hong Kong is restored to civilian administration before a new decision can be made. But when will Hong Kong's civilian government be restored? Hong Kong has been under military government control for four months.</p>
<p>Putting aside the major military, political, and economic issues, Hong Kong currently has two or three minor issues that are giving people a headache: the housing problem, the prostitution problem, and the public security problem. Regarding the first two issues of housing and health, foreigners seem to be even more vocal than our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>Serious Housing Problem of Requisitioned Civilian Houses</p>
<p>Foreigners pay more attention than we do to the comfort of their lives. Currently, in Hong Kong's upscale residential areas, such as The Peak, Happy Valley, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon Tong, and Prince Edward Road, the houses that were rented to foreigners before the war were occupied by the Japanese during the war, and now they are being requisitioned by the British Royal Marines, Royal Air Force, or other military personnel. These soldiers inevitably live a bit luxuriously. The English-language South China Morning Post commented: "The requisition of houses must meet practical needs. If they are used as warehouses, offices, or canteens, small wooden houses should be built instead of requisitioning civilian houses." The newspaper appealed to the highest military authorities to give sympathetic consideration to the construction of those wooden houses and to return some houses for the residence of the people.</p>
<p>Fellow Countrymen Find Housing Supply Falls Far Short of Demand</p>
<p>The housing for fellow countrymen is also in short supply. The former tenement houses have been bombed, with the areas of Wan Chai and Hung Hom being the worst. The entire Jaffe Road in Wan Chai no longer has a single complete house. Some houses have been destroyed by thugs who removed the wood from the houses. It is estimated that this type of damaged house accounts for about 2% of all houses. Some houses have been demolished by the Japanese to meet military needs. In Kowloon City alone, more than a dozen streets and three villages were razed to the ground and converted into airfields. People who survived under the iron heel of the Japanese are now discovering their golden opportunity. They are raising the rental value of houses, and even pre-renting some houses to wait for "good prices to be topped." Some people coming to Hong Kong from the mainland are even spending hundreds of thousands of national currency to rent a house. If they do not have that much money in their pockets, they can only live in slums, but they still have to pay three or four times the pre-war price.</p>
<p>Compulsory Enforcement of Prostitution Hygiene Advocated</p>
<p>Chinese people have always been embarrassed to discuss the issue of prostitution publicly, and in some places, there is even a custom of "laughing at poverty but not at prostitution." According to the current situation, if we say that Hong Kong is a "world of soldiers" because there are so many soldiers, then it seems that Hong Kong is almost a "world of prostitution" without shame.</p>
<p>Hong Kong was a civilized city that banned prostitution before the war. Therefore, some people who care about social morality are reiterating the old tune of banning prostitution. Foreigners pay more attention to hygiene. Foreign newspapers have repeatedly published reports of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, advocating the implementation of management of prostitutes in order to enforce hygiene inspections. A certain foreigner wrote to the newspaper, saying that there are so many prostitutes in Hong Kong, how can he feel at ease bringing his wife and daughter back.</p>
<p>Bandits Are More Terrible Than Prostitutes</p>
<p>A friend told the reporter that in Hong Kong, it has become difficult to find a woman who has not been a prostitute to be his wife. However, why should we men interfere so much in women's affairs? Men who become thieves are not necessarily more honorable or justified than women who engage in prostitution. Currently, bandits in Hong Kong are indeed more terrible than prostitutes. In the past few days, the English-language "South China Morning Post" has been filled with news of bandit activities. Robbery in broad daylight and shooting at night are almost daily occurrences. If it were really possible, I would like the red-robed, white-haired Santa Claus to send me a state-of-the-art self-defense pistol.</p>
<p>Japanese Weapons Thrown into Aomori Sea</p>
<p>The work of destroying Japanese munitions factories has been initiated by the Allied Headquarters' directive. The image shows Japanese soldiers and laborers ordered to load munitions onto barges and head out to sea off Aomori, northern Honshu, to throw them all into the sea.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Today's Double Celebration</h3>
<p>Today should be our happiest and most exciting day! Today, we really have two joyful events worth celebrating. In London, the first session of the United Nations General Assembly opens today. All plans to uphold human justice and ensure world peace are awaiting the United Nations General Assembly's open discussion and practical implementation in the future. In Chongqing, the Political Consultative Conference convened by the National Government is also being held today. After the Three-Person Committee discusses ways to stop the conflict, the "ceasefire" order may be issued immediately, and the door to peaceful resolution will be wide open from then on. If all parties can truly be sincere and open, it will not be difficult for the Chinese political situation to embark on a bright and happy path. After China fought bloody battles for eight years, and the world was engulfed in war, humanity suffered greatly. Today, we can see calm and quiet, and the smoke of war has cleared, allowing us to glimpse the dawn of true peace for the whole world and China. This is indeed fortunate and a joyful event. Our wartime capital was in Chongqing, and the Political Consultative Conference is also being held in Chongqing. Today, both at home and abroad, there are joyful events, which is truly worthy of "double celebration".</p>
<p>Whether the United Nations General Assembly can proceed smoothly in the future is, of course, not something anyone can guarantee. However, judging from the spirit of cooperation among the major democratic countries during the war, from resisting aggression shoulder to shoulder to working together to create peace, the repeated meetings, although there may be some twists and turns in between, generally seem to be progressing step by step and helping each other at all times. Especially the recent Moscow Three-Foreign Ministers Conference resolved many outstanding issues, and the undeniable gaps between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding Eastern issues have indeed been more than half eliminated. Between China and the Soviet Union, in addition to the signing of the Thirty-Year Treaty of Alliance and Friendship, Chiang Ching-kuo's recent trip to Moscow resolved many relevant issues regarding the reception of the Northeast. The National Army has already been airlifted to Changchun, and the political situation in the Northeast will inevitably gradually become clear. Looking at the overall world situation, as long as Britain and the Soviet Union can negotiate a reasonable solution to the German issue, the European issue, the Near East, and the Middle East issues, and China and France, as well as other Allied countries, can have their proper status and reasonable demands in their respective relevant issues, then everyone's open discussions can make a great contribution to world peace. We believe that humanity cannot see a cruel war again, especially after the invention of the atomic bomb. Whether scientific progress is a blessing or a curse depends on humanity's own decision. Today's opening of the United Nations General Assembly is the true beginning of "one world". Although we do not dare to believe that the theories of "world state" or "world government" advocated by some British and American philosophers and politicians can be realized today, we can at least believe that humanity is moving in this direction. As long as all countries, especially the major countries, can maintain a spirit of sincerity and cooperation, there will be a better future for the whole world. Therefore, the domestic and foreign joy is overflowing and worthy of great celebration.</p>
<p>As for China's internal problems, it is shameful to say the least. China was the first major country to resist aggression and was also one of the last major countries to fight against aggression to the end. After victory, China has its deserved international status, and the Chinese people have the right to live and work in peace and contentment. Unexpectedly, after the victory in the war against foreign aggression, there was inevitably fighting in the country. Transportation was destroyed, industries and mines were damaged, and local disturbances were constant, making people "unable to return home", farmers unable to cultivate, workers unable to work, and merchants unable to transport, and peace and tranquility became illusions! These three or four months of great time have been spent in the Communist army's struggle for cities and territories. Fortunately, God blesses China, and peace has not become hopeless. The government has been able to tolerate it fully, and the Allied countries are also willing to mediate, so that the Communist Party representatives who came late arrived in the capital. Today, not only has the Three-Person Committee held four meetings, negotiated the main points of stopping the conflict and restoring transportation, and the ceasefire order will be issued immediately, but also the Political Consultative Conference officially opened to discuss the plan for peaceful nation-building. Peace, peace! Nation-building, nation-building! What joyful and congratulatory terms, what beautiful scenes that millions of people pray for day and night and wish to realize soon! We wish the conference a smooth consultation, and we especially hope that this glass of celebratory wine can be truly drunk to the fullest.</p>
<p>We believe that the political consultation must disclose the facts at any time, not promote one-sided propaganda, and allow national public opinion to make fair judgments. The success or failure of this matter is not only of great concern to the Chinese people, but also to people all over the world. If the consultation succeeds, there is hope for peace; if the consultation fails, war is inevitable. One move and one person are too important. Our first hope is to achieve a ceasefire first, a real and serious ceasefire. Secondly, the restoration of transportation must be done in the shortest possible time, with railways and shipping unimpeded, and no party should be allowed to delay or obstruct it under any pretext. And the unification of military and political orders is the minimum condition for a country. Today, the most important task of the Political Consultative Conference is nothing more than this. If these core issues are avoided and there is no concrete solution, and the Communist army is still allowed to independently organize, independently issue orders, independently determine defense zones, and independently set up checkpoints, then all consultations are empty talk to fool people! Therefore, we believe that the representatives of all parties must rely on their conscience and tell the truth. Everyone must work for the country and the people, and must not let go of this great opportunity for peaceful nation-building. And it must not be that they are scheming against each other, always holding a "party" and a "faction" in their hearts, but still forgetting a "country"! The country is shared by all the people. Today, the public is consulting on national affairs. Right and wrong, in the end, we must let the people say a word. If the public has any unresolved disputes, we must also ask the people for a fair decision. To achieve a consultation of "the world is for the public," we must first have a spirit of "no self". If everyone is still thinking about "my" party and "my" faction, naturally there is no understanding, tolerance, and mutual concession. Therefore, we believe that only when the conference is conducted in absolute openness, and the people participating in the conference hold the mentality of "nothing cannot be said to others," and can do what they say, and must do what they say, can they succeed, and the joyful event can truly be celebrated greatly.</p>
<h3>China and the UK to Develop Gliding Together</h3>
<p>The China Gliding Association held a model glider flying competition this past Christmas. China's aviation industry has indeed made significant progress recently, and the UK is also working hard to train glider pilots. Training flight personnel is a very important matter, and it is also an indispensable condition for military operations.</p>
<p>Recently, the UK has drafted a new method to train glider pilots. This plan is usually included in the aviation training group plan. The aviation training group is a branch of the Royal Air Force, and its mission is to train boys to join the Air Force. The children start training from the age of fourteen until they grow up and join the Royal Air Force. Although these children participate in the training group voluntarily, and they are trained in their spare time, their service to the Royal Air Force during the war has been remarkable. They are the young branches of the Royal Air Force, their uniforms are very similar to the uniforms of the Royal Air Force, and they also receive military training under the guidance of Royal Air Force officers.</p>
<p>In British life, the aviation training group will become a permanent and unique organization, and it is the training center for future aviation personnel in the UK. The new plan released by the British Aviation Department also includes the training of two-seater gliders, and the accommodation and supply of students are also included in the plan proposed by the Aviation Department.</p>
<p>According to this new plan, the UK will add many two-seater gliders. The original gliders were standard single-seater aircraft. At the same time, the UK also plans to add 100 standard single-seater aircraft to supplement the 300 new single-seater gliders in the aviation training group's primary school.</p>
<p>In the gliding school of the aviation training group, the students' accommodation and meals are all provided by the school, with the same treatment as the Royal Air Force.</p>
<p>In order to implement the new plan, 200 aviation officers are now being trained as school instructors. At the same time, the authorities have specially allowed the issuance of travel permits so that students from remote areas will not be hindered when entering aviation schools.</p>
<p>These new evaluations will not only enable students to make rapid progress, but also enable most of the 100,000 aviation school students to learn gliding skills.</p>
<p>The glider pilot regiment is a main and sound part of all air force units. According to the new plan of the aviation training group, a core organization is needed in the glider pilot regiment. In modern warfare, in order to deal with various strange tactics, such a core organization is very necessary.</p>

<h3>Ban on Exporting Yarn and Cloth Causes Price to Plummet; Textile Companies Yesterday Released Large Quantities of Special Double Horses, Which Fell by 150,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market fell sharply. The price of each yarn fell by another 10%. It was rumored in the market that the customs authorities temporarily banned the export of yarn to Hong Kong, which caused the Hong Kong and Guangdong customers to sell off. This is the truth. Therefore, the special double horse, which rose to a new peak of 910,000 a week ago, plummeted to 680,000. The closing price was 150,000 lower than the previous day. The remaining 20 yarns also fell by 50,000 to 70,000. People's hearts were weak, because the China Textile Construction Corporation continued to sell a large amount of 20 blue phoenix yarn for 680,000.</p>
<p>The China Textile Construction Corporation continued to release yarn and cloth yesterday. Although the price was lower than the market price, the goods could only be picked up in ten days. It is also heard that the company will slightly adjust its plans today before releasing goods again. The prices are listed below (including commodity tax, unit: yuan):</p>
<p>20 Blue Phoenix Yarn 680,000</p>
<p>32 Blue Phoenix Yarn 1,040,000</p>
<p>32 Fairy Peach Thread 1,100,000</p>
<p>40 Colored Ball Yarn 1,100,000</p>
<p>42 Water Moon Thread 1,250,000</p>
<p>12 Pounds Five Blessings Fine Cloth 35,000</p>
<p>12 Pounds Colored Ball Fine Cloth 35,000</p>
<p>More than ten dyeing and weaving factories, such as Xinfeng, Tianyi, and Lunhua, purchased a total of 6,000 pieces of fine cloth. Factories such as Tongfeng and Zhenfeng took away dozens of packages of yarn.</p>
<h3>Speculative Capital Trends Towards Securities, Category C Rises to 1,600, Real Estate Stocks Soar Together</h3>
<p>Spot Gold: Yesterday, it did not break free from consolidation. Although interday sentiment was good, the prevailing city price did not keep up, resulting in ample supply at higher levels. As the upward momentum was thwarted, speculative capital turned elsewhere. After the morning opening, it gradually declined from 8.74 million. Cotton cloth prices continued to worsen due to President Song's order to sell off sealed materials, which affected sentiment. (It is said that 700 cotton bales and 70,000 bolts of cloth are to be allocated). At noon, it struggled around 8.5 million. In the afternoon, it weakened further, with the current futures price retreating to 8.32 million before entering consolidation. As a result, it closed 28,000 lower than the previous close. Gold jewelry was quoted at 90,000 yuan, silver taels at 700 yuan, and silver dollars hovered around 460 yuan. The unofficial interest rates were around six to ten percent yesterday as money lenders had excessive capital. Spinning factories also have capital to lend. The rate is depended on need. Industry is now focused on stocks, so the need is less, and interest rates are unlikely to rise in the short term.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: The US dollar was initially firm but later weakened, still unable to deviate too far from the gold market. Arbitrageurs were more diligent, and spinning factories also absorbed some. After the low, it remained relatively stable. Many US material ships arrived yesterday, making the trend more powerful than the gold market. It opened at 1,480 yuan but later declined due to the drop in gold prices, triggering a selling spree. Later, factory absorption and arbitrage revived somewhat, and the price found support around 1,460 yuan, consolidating for a long time. In the afternoon, it was affected by the gold market, retreating to within 1,440 yuan, down 35 yuan from the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar remained sluggish with no sales. Compared to the previous close, old notes fell by 5 yuan, and new notes by 1 to 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: The environment favored buying, and the pull-up was reckless. The ceasefire order between the Nationalists and Communists is imminent, boosting buying sentiment from all sides. Category C opened immediately with the residual momentum from the previous day, rising to 980 yuan. After opening, there was a slight dip, but major players continued to pull it up, gradually recovering from around 960 yuan to a new high of 1,060 yuan. During this process, a certain bank on Sichuan Road and bullish players in the industry gradually liquidated, causing the market to feel gradually loosen. Although it rose, the situation did not break free from mediocrity. At noon, some of the floating gains were realized, struggling at the 1,000 yuan mark. As a result, it rose another 70 to 110 yuan compared to the previous close. Miscellaneous bonds were more advantageous than Category C and E due to the time factor.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: Continued to be absorbed by speculative capital from foreign stocks, and the market was exceptionally heated. New long positions were continuously added, and some industry players sold off, diverting residual capital to foreign stocks. Due to the rally in foreign stocks, Chinese stocks also echoed remotely, resulting in extremely confused supply and demand. Market prices fluctuated unpredictably. Yongxing Spinning opened at 1,120 yuan and later rose to around 1,220 yuan. Mei Ya rose from 780 yuan to 865 yuan, and Xinyi rose from 270 yuan to 330 yuan. At noon, due to major players in the industry releasing shares, Yongxing Spinning retreated to 1,100 yuan, Mei Ya to within 800 yuan, and Xinyi to 280 yuan. The "Three Small Heats" were more mediocre. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongxing Spinning continued to rise by 85 yuan, Mei Ya by 45 yuan, and Xinyi by 45 yuan. The "Three Small Heats" rose by 3 to 5.5 yuan each. Various unpopular stocks continued to follow. China Underwear, which had been neglected for a long time, was suddenly favored by major players, rising from around 45 yuan to 60 yuan, finally settling at 54 yuan. Xinyi Real Estate also rose to around 30 yuan due to news of a reduction in land tax.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks: Continued to exchange with speculative capital from Chinese stocks and were continuously bought by major players from the Chinese stock side, gradually rising. Ye Guang was highly sought after due to rumors of a reduction in property tax, with buyers rising one after another. At noon, compared to the previous close, Yisha rose by 350 yuan, Yipi by 130 yuan, Paper Industry by 120 yuan, and Ye Guang soared by 470 yuan. Other rubber stocks declined slightly because securities firms did not pay attention to them.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Shows Slight Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market followed the decline in gold prices and traded in a small range. The morning opening price for Tianqiao No. 120 was 850,000 yuan, which quickly recovered to 860,000-870,000 yuan. The closing price in the afternoon was 850,000 yuan, down 40,000-50,000 yuan from the previous day. As the authorities suppressed prices and sold off large quantities of materials, most commodities showed a slight fatigue. No. 150 was scarce and expensive, trading at 930,000 yuan for the East. No. 75 semi-gloss silk had sluggish sales, trading at 690,000 yuan. There were slight transactions in factory silk, and the price was slightly lower than the previous day. The silk fabric market was actively bought by all parties for several days, and yesterday the raw materials fell, and the price also looked smaller. Mei Ya lining traded at 585,000 yuan, and Minsheng brocade traded at 8,800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Not Allowed to be Shipped to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that, according to the order of the President of the Executive Yuan, all cotton yarn and cotton cloth should be immediately prohibited from being exported to foreign countries. All cotton yarn and cotton cloth already booked for shipment to Hong Kong will be temporarily cancelled, and customs clearance procedures will be handled.</p>
<h3>Food Prices Rise Across the Board, White Yuan Soars by 600-700 Yuan</h3>
<p>After a long period of weakness, rice and grains are now rising due to the increase in various commodities. Northern rice saw a slight increase in absorption, and production areas in the mainland rose, with Shanghai following suit. Japonica rice increased by 300-400 yuan, early thin rice by 200-300 yuan, and customer indica and sheep indica by 200-300 yuan. Glutinous rice (i.e., white yuan) rose sharply by 600-700 yuan due to active consumption as the New Year approached. Flour had very active outgoing routes to Fujian and Taiwan, soaring by 300-400 yuan. Soybeans continued to be processed in Ningbo and loaded in the South Seas, rising another 200-300 yuan. The oil market saw sluggish sales of peanut oil, and soybean oil softened by 1,000 yuan. Raw oil was also weak. Raw peanuts remained scarce and expensive, rising another 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were actively traded in the South Seas, Fujian, Shantou, and Taiwan, rising another 100 yuan. Local wine remained flat.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Traders Process Woolens</h3>
<p>The trend for woolens remained flat, with few transactions. Only major and minor Sichuan traders slightly increased their intake. The standard market price at the Public Tea Association mostly shifted with customers' needs. Yesterday, such as broadcloth, gabardine, fancy suiting, melton, palisce, and herring bone all saw slight increases. Riding breeches, Tussah silk, heavy kersey, overcoating, grass green French lining, horse hair, long-haired velvet, etc., all trended downstream.</p>
<h3>Tea Sales are Quite Brisk, Inventory is Very Depleted</h3>
<p>Since the victory, although the overseas routes for red and green tea in this city have remained stagnant, domestic areas such as Tianjin and Guangdong are gradually returning to normal due to transportation, so sales are increasing daily. Unfortunately, the current inventory in this city is very depleted, so the trend is that supply cannot meet demand, and market prices have been rising steadily in recent days. Yesterday, in addition to Tianjin traders continuing to import fried green and baked green tea, the shops in this street also showed interest in red and green tea. It is also heard that Qingdao traders may also start processing tea in the coming days, so sentiment is strengthened, and the market atmosphere is generally rising by more than 2,000-3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions were extremely active, with a total outgoing volume of approximately 400 dan.</p>
<h3>New York Cotton Market Firm</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 9th] Yesterday, the New York cotton market opened slightly higher by 5 to 7 points. Shortly after opening, buying interest was active, and new cotton rose by 20 points. Later, due to a strike by the Western Telegraph Company, communication was interrupted, and news of transactions was suddenly restricted, and the market situation returned to calm. At the close, old cotton fell slightly, and new cotton prices were quite reactive. The midday close was higher by 5 to 14 points.</p>
<h3>Commercial Summary</h3>
<p>Knitwear: Yesterday, the situation of tight yarn prices had disappeared, and yarn prices were significantly lower than the previous day. Gold prices also saw a slight recovery. Another reason is that there are rumors in the market that knitwear exports will be prohibited.</p>
<p>Raw Sugar: The factory's white sugar production is short, and the amount of sugar purchased at parity prices is not satisfactory, so there is a strong upward trend.</p>
<p>Northern and Southern Goods: Market prices are generally high, and the sales performance of traders in this street is even better than before. At this time of the Lunar New Year, it should continue to show a firm trend, especially red dates, where a move by traders in Guangdong caused the market to become even more scarce.</p>
<p>Dried Longan: After new large-piece dried longan appeared, the price rose as sales in this street were more active. Listed prices rose by about 10% before and after. However, those with inferior color were not surprising. Other small pieces and old goods were also flat and weak.</p>
<p>Red Yeast Rice: Arrivals were high, but sales were sluggish, and the market trend fell. The highest price is compared to the current market, and the decrease has reached two-thirds. Yesterday's market saw less than 40,000 yuan for shops in the middle, around 30,000 yuan for ordinary shops, and 50,000-60,000 yuan for upper shops. It is also heard that Chaozhou qu are being shipped, so there is little hope of recovery for the time being.</p>
<p>Seafood: Those that are suitable for actual sales saw rising prices. When traders ask for goods, the brokers immediately raise prices, and they are even less willing to let go of top-quality goods.</p>
<p>Dyes: Traders are very keen on chasing popular brands, and BB indigo powder is scarce, even requiring sourcing from small dyeing factories. Furthermore, the goods of a certain two major foreign companies of former German merchants are packaged by dyestuff traders and monopolized, making the available chips in the market even scarcer.</p>
<p>Foreign Paper: Market prices are firm, but lightweight Dowling paper is particularly popular due to high demand and limited inventory. Other goods saw slight discrepancies, and transactions have decreased, with a slightly weaker customer appetite.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Due to the authorities suppressing prices and Japanese cigarette factories resuming production soon, small factories are constantly shipping goods such as Swan brand, causing buying interest to decline, and market prices were weak at the morning opening. In the afternoon, they continued to fall as selling was more than buying. As a result, they were all lower than the previous market. Old Dao retreated to within 6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>White Coal: Frequent declines. White coal fines and firewood are slightly better.</p>
<p>Western Medicine: There are people asking about them, sales are continuous, and sentiment is firm. Yesterday's market continued to report increases.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>6,000 tons of American wheat, loaded on the Huilin Weier Pifeier, will arrive in Shanghai today. This ship is managed by Fulai Company. This wheat is entirely for relief. Also, the rescue goods brought by the Tuoli Haituoweiya have been unloaded, and a portion will be shipped to Xiaoluson, Hong Kong tomorrow on the original ship.</p>
<p>The Samotai, managed by the British Far East Shipping Manager's Office, arrived in Shanghai today with 8,300 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. The coal was shipped by the Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>Canned green peas, manufactured by member factories of the Biscuit, Candy, Canned Food, and Bread Industry Association, were previously sold in the South Seas Islands. The volume was huge. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Economic Affairs prohibited exports, and the ban has not been lifted since the victory. Therefore, the Industry Association has submitted a document to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that the Jianghai Customs be allowed to export to facilitate export trade.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Gas Company has strict overage limits for users and has established penalty regulations. The proportion of fines increases greatly. Most of its users are in the tinplate can manufacturing industry, and the demand often exceeds the limit. Therefore, they gathered for consultation and submitted a document to the Public Utilities Bureau through the association, requesting that the gas company be ordered to cancel this restriction, which would damage the industry excessively and be contrary to the government's policy of encouraging production.</p>
<p>The foreign wine and food industry in this city had an independent trade association before the war. During the puppet government era, it was unreasonably merged. Now, the Social Bureau has appointed Shen Zhaomu and others as organizing committee members to prepare for the organization, and the registration is now underway.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the industry associations be instructed to compile a membership roster and submit it by January 15th for reference. The Cloth Merchants Association, considering this to be a solid preparation before taxation, requested that each association first list the registered members, and divide them into four structures according to the above format (namely, shop name, shop address, name of the person in charge, and organizational situation), and submit them to the association before January 10th for compilation and forwarding.</p>
<p>The income tax and excessive profit tax for the previous year will be levied in February. The excessive profit tax is a wartime tax system and is abolished one year after recovery in accordance with precedents in various countries. Therefore, the excessive profit tax for this year should still be levied.</p>
<p>The duty-paid value of goods is adjusted every three months. The Ministry of Finance has convened a valuation meeting in accordance with the legal formula in December last year, based on commodity prices in various regions, to review and approve the taxable prices for January to June of this year, and implemented them on January 1st of this year. In order to be practical, it is said that the authorities have authorized the competent district bureaus to approve the taxable prices in the recovered areas.</p>

<h3>The Music Education Needed Today</h3>
<p>— Song Shou Chang</p>
<p>In this new year, we are presented with a new atmosphere, and we should embrace endless new hopes for everything. If last year was the year of victory, then this year should be called the year of nation-building. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, various construction projects have been actively promoted, especially cultural and educational undertakings, which have more new plans and new facilities. Taking Shanghai as an example, regarding the promotion of art education, the Education Bureau has plans for the establishment of art centers, labor centers, and music centers, as well as the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Drama School, while the Shanghai Municipal Museum is being prepared for restoration. These plans and implementations are of utmost importance to the promotion of cultural and educational undertakings. However, in the process of implementation, I believe that we should start with what is currently essential. Regarding music education, I would like to offer a few opinions based on my limited knowledge:</p>
<p>(1) Emphasis on the Popularization of Music Education: The primary goal of music courses in primary and secondary schools is to develop students' musical talents and interests. Therefore, in addition to general learning, we should also focus on cultivating musical talents. However, at present, music, art, and other subjects are still regarded as leisure subjects in the school curriculum. We should first enable the general public to have a considerable understanding of music and provide them with active guidance to achieve the goal of music education.</p>
<p>(2) Training of Music Education Teachers: To popularize music education, we must have a large number of teachers to shoulder this task. However, in the current actual situation, there is a real shortage of excellent music teachers. It is hoped that art vocational normal schools will be established everywhere, art departments will be added to normal colleges, and music vocational schools will focus on the cultivation of music teachers, training excellent teachers to meet the current needs. In the current situation of a shortage of music teachers, it can only be undertaken by incumbent music teachers. However, we must find ways to assist them and improve their teaching techniques. In this regard, the Ministry of Education or the Education Bureau should promptly organize short-term music teacher training classes to give them opportunities for further study.</p>
<p>(3) Supply of Music Teaching Materials: The most difficult thing for general music teachers in implementing education at present is not so much the lack of technical cultivation, but the lack of teaching materials. Because music teaching materials are different from others, they are most subject to timeliness. For example, the songs sung during the War of Resistance were mostly about charging and killing enemies and arousing emotions, but now that the War of Resistance has been won, they cannot be applied. The main themes should be completing the great cause of nation-building, promoting the national spirit, and advocating the new life movement. To solve the shortage of music teaching materials, those who promote music education should take responsibility for selecting, producing, distributing, and applying them.</p>
<p>(4) Utilizing Broadcasting: In the main areas of the country's provinces and cities, public radios and broadcasting machines should be universally installed to broadcast noble music for the appreciation of the public, so as to achieve the effectiveness of social education. Other activities, such as holding concerts and inviting famous musicians to give lectures on broadcasting, are also essential tasks for promoting music education.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth in This City Prohibited from Exporting to Foreign Countries: Customs Announces Order from the Executive Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hong Kong route by British ships, goods shipped from this city to Guangdong and various places in Southeast Asia have been transshipped through Hong Kong, and the number of cotton yarn pieces is also large. The British Far East Shipping Agency has two ships, Yong Sheng and Yue Zhou, scheduled to set sail for Hong Kong tomorrow at the same time. Yong Sheng only sells seats in the dining room, and Yue Zhou and other low-class passenger tickets are generally not sold. There are many merchants' goods. The two ships are scheduled to transport no less than 3,000 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to Hong Kong. The transportation companies signed customs documents and were carrying out customs declaration and loading procedures to the customs. The customs export counter suddenly announced that cotton yarn and cotton cloth were not allowed to be transported to Hong Kong. The transportation companies then withdrew the scheduled cargo spaces from the British Far East Shipping Agency and handled customs clearance procedures. The cargo volume of the two ships was reduced as a result. It is now planned to fill the gap with relief supplies. Regarding the prohibition of exports, the Customs Department has received an order from the Executive Yuan. The Jianghai Customs Announcement No. 25 is recorded as follows: "On the order of the President of the Executive Yuan, cotton yarn and cotton cloth should be immediately prohibited from being exported to foreign countries. You should comply accordingly, etc. I hereby announce this in addition to complying. Simultaneously serving as Tax Commissioner Ding Guitang, January 9, 35th year."</p>

<h3>General Chennault Scheduled to Go to Chongqing</h3>
<p>General Chennault, who has been here for four days, is still busy with social engagements day and night. The number of Chinese and foreign people who visit Chen every day is countless. The telephone in his room rings on average every ten minutes or so. General Chen plans to go to Chongqing this morning, but later changed the date to go to Chongqing by plane the day after tomorrow to visit President Chiang. When asked repeatedly about his mission in China, the General said, "I really haven't decided yet, but I can tell you soon." Chen's trip to China, with a large and small leather box, a carry-on basket, the luggage is very simple. When meeting the reporter, he once wore a gray suit, and then switched to military uniform.

<h3>If France Does Not Change Its Attitude on the Case of French Ships Smuggling War Criminals, We Will Consider New Actions</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Because it is often rumored that a French government spokesman has formally stated that regarding the "Bairexiang" ship incident, the French government has decided to support the position of Fei Lihuo, the French Consul General in Shanghai, the reporter specifically interviewed Lu Huaijun, the secretary of the Shanghai Office of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Lu said: What France insists on now is that a new Sino-French treaty has not yet been signed, so it believes that France still maintains consular jurisdiction in China.</p>
<p>However, my country formally declared the abolition of this privilege of the French government as early as May of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, in a note to Peng Gu'er, the acting consul of the French Embassy in China. Years have passed, and the French side has never raised any objections. Even when our country recognized the de Gaulle government, the de Gaulle government did not raise objections to this point, which shows that the French government has actually</p>
<p>Tacitly Accepted This</p>
<p>Since the French government uses the failure to sign a new treaty as an excuse to maintain consular jurisdiction, then in the same note to Peng Gu'er in the 32nd year of our country, the Chinese government also declared the abolition of the French concession. Does the French government still want to maintain its concession in China today? The privileges stipulated in unequal treaties can be unilaterally abolished by our country, and the aforementioned statement to Peng Gu'er was originally a kind of</p>
<p>Retaliatory Measure</p>
<p>Because France illegally recognized the puppet organization and signed a treaty with it. It has its basis in international law. Mr. Lu also said that this case is now being negotiated in Chongqing. If the French still do not change their attitude, our country may consider taking further new actions. The reporter also specifically asked Mr. Lu for his opinion on the report that the French government will submit this case to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. Mr. Lu asked in return, does France's desire to maintain its consular jurisdiction that comes with unequal treaties today conform to the ideals of the United Nations itself? Moreover, without the consent of the two countries involved, one country cannot independently request international court arbitration.</p>
<h3>Our Protest to France</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A broadcast from San Francisco late at midnight on the 9th stated: Chinese Foreign Minister Liu Jie declared: The new Sino-French treaty stipulates that the French side gives up its extraterritorial rights, and the French side has been ordered to abolish its consular court in Shanghai. The Chinese side protested against the French Consul General in Shanghai's unauthorized arrest of French collaborators.</p>
<h3>National Transportation Conference to Be Held in Beijing</h3>

Minister Yu Feipeng may go to Beijing to preside over the meeting.</p>

<h3>Hoping that China Can Unite Like the United States: An Interview with General Chennault</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter, Mai Tian</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, General Chennault, the former commander of the American Fourteenth Air Force Flying Tigers, undoubtedly had to keep busy again. At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, when the reporter stepped into his reception room, he saw a guest talking to him. Just as he bid farewell at ten o'clock, another person came to find him, which shows that what he said, that someone is always coming to see him here, is true.</p>
<p>This is General Chen's second visit to Shanghai. In May 1937, he came to Shanghai, but later returned to China because the Sino-Japanese War broke out. He felt that Shanghai, as he saw it this time, was somewhat different from what he had seen for the first time. However, he said:</p>
<p>Praising the Shanghai People for Their Diligence in Work</p>
<p>"The Shanghai people are happy, they have not suffered any losses from war bombings, etc., only the roads and transportation have been damaged." One thing General Chen thought was very satisfactory was: "The Shanghai people are still diligent and busy, and they are all working as usual. Although it will take a long time to restore the prosperity of before the war." He said, "I have been to various places in Europe, and those people are depressed and don't want to work at all, which is very wrong."</p>
<p>"General, you have been to the interior of China. Do you think there is any difference between the people in the interior and here?"</p>
<p>"Well, of course, I think the people in the interior are better than here, they are more simple, unlike the people here who are a little false and learn the foreign style." He means that the Chinese people should best keep their inherent customs.</p>
<p>Deafness in Both Ears from Too Much Flying</p>
<p>While talking, the phone rang. But General Chen didn't hear it. Later, I told him that there was a ringtone, and he asked me whether it was a knock on the door or a phone. He said that because he had flown too much, he couldn't hear his ears. It always seemed that the sound of airplanes was ringing, and he couldn't even hear the sound of the phone next door. Although many doctors have treated him, they can't cure him. General Chen's contribution to the air force of the United States and China can be known from the sound of his ears.</p>
<p>Regarding the training of the Chinese Air Force, General Chen said that he has no plans at the moment. He came this time only to see China after the war. He will go to Chongqing in a few days to meet with President Chiang and Marshal Marshall, etc.</p>
<p>"If President Chiang asks the General to assist in training the air force, what are the General's plans?" "I still want to think about it before deciding."</p>
<p>Enrich the Air Force and Build More Weapons</p>
<p>General Chen believes that air force schools should be established in many places, distributed in the east, south, west, and north. But China should build several arsenals itself to manufacture military equipment. China's current air force and army are very good, but they lack weapons and equipment. The reason why the United States is strong is because its industry is developed and it supplies its own weapons. At present, the number of Chinese air force personnel receiving training in the United States is constantly maintained at one thousand, and new ones are sent after each graduation, but he personally has no direct relationship with this matter.</p>
<p>"What kind of work did you do during your return to China?"</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything in the United States. I traveled everywhere."</p>
<p>Americans Have Very Little Understanding of China</p>
<p>"What is the impression of the Chinese among Americans?"</p>
<p>"Americans have very little understanding of China. They think that China is similar to the United States and is a unified country, but they don't know that China is divided into many regions."</p>
<p>"What is the situation in the United States after the war?" "The United States has not yet returned to a state of peace. There are disputes over labor issues in the country, and prices are also rising. People just want to revel for a while. The United States needs to build six million new families after the war, which will take many years! At the same time, it will take the United States a year to return to its pre-war state."</p>
<p>"What is the General's own opinion on the political situation in China?"</p>
<p>"I hope that China, like the United States, can unite and make everything in the country developed in the future. In terms of transportation, we must shorten the journey, just like it only takes a few hours to get from the east coast to the west coast of the United States."</p>
<p>The Communist Party Should Be Incorporated into the Government as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>"Regarding the Communist Party issue, like other Americans, I think the Communist Party should be incorporated into the government. There are also many parties in the United States, but a democratic country should adopt an election system. It is possible to elect the Republican Party this year and the Democratic Party next year, but once elected, it should become a unified country."</p>
<p>General Chen is prepared to stay in Chongqing for about a week, and then come to Shanghai for a period of time. The plan after that has not been determined. He would very much like to visit northern China, Hankou, Changsha, and Guangzhou, and would also like to revisit his old residence in Kunming. If he has the opportunity, he plans to go to Tokyo.</p>
<p>General Chennault is a good friend of China. He helps China and loves China. I remember last autumn, when General Chen resigned and returned to China, the sincere retention and warm welcome from all walks of life in Kunming and Chongqing. This is not something that can be achieved by his achievements in one or two days.</p>
<h3>Film Distributors Agree to Free Movie Admission for Military Personnel</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Representatives from various cinemas in this city and representatives from American film distributors held a meeting at the Dahua Theater yesterday at 4:00 PM to discuss arrangements for military personnel to attend movies. According to Mr. Li Dihao, a representative from the theater side, during the previous meeting, film distributors firmly opposed the theater's proposal for free movie admission for military personnel. Later, Mr. Li personally requested assistance from Mr. Howard, the U.S. Deputy Consul in Shanghai, and submitted a formal written request. Mr. Howard endeavored to find a solution acceptable to both parties. As a result, yesterday's meeting concluded with the film distributors agreeing in principle to free admission, provided that the theaters pay the rental fees for the films. The theaters have also agreed to this condition. However, the issue of the fees still needs to be discussed. The film distributors view this as a serious matter and have imposed rather harsh conditions: If similar incidents of trouble caused by Chinese military personnel during non-free admission times occur again, they will decide to withdraw all films distributed to the city. They are now awaiting a guarantee from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on this point before implementation. Mr. Li plans to bring the conditions proposed by the film distributors to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters today for a report and to discuss other solutions. It is heard that the theaters intend to rotate a group of ten cinemas each Saturday at noon to offer free admission. However, the Garrison Headquarters requests Sunday at noon. The final decision will be made after further negotiation.</p>

<h3>High Court Special Criminal Tribunal to Try Li Ze This Morning - Summons Sent to Employee Representatives for Confrontation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After being detained by the police and interrogated by the High Court, Li Ze is scheduled to be publicly tried at 9:30 AM this morning at the High Court Special Criminal Tribunal in the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison. Yesterday morning, summons were sent to the four original informants, Han Wucheng, Shu Yueqiao, Yao Zhuoren, and Ye Qiubin, employee representatives of the Xinxin Company, to appear in court on time for confrontation. Huang Zhenguang, the former chief of the General Affairs Section and the current head of the Dispatch Department of the company, was also summoned to bring the account books of the Xinxin Company for September 1944 for verification. In addition, Han Zhiming and Han Zhiyun, owners of the Senda Iron Factory on Zhongzheng South Road, were summoned to bring their factory's account books for September 1944 to compare with the Xinxin Company books and determine whether the Xinxin Company's 20,000 catties of scrap iron were used to support the enemy. A Mr. Fu was also summoned, but his identity is unknown.</p>
<p>Employee Representatives Collect Evidence</p>
<p>Lawyer Sha Qianli, who recently came to Shanghai from the rear area and is a voluntary legal advisor for the Xinxin Company employees, is assisting them in resolving all legal issues. The employee representatives have made every effort to collect all relevant documents to submit to the judge when the court convenes this morning. The representatives also stated that their accusation against Li Ze is purely based on a sense of justice and has nothing to do with any personal gain. For example, other colleagues recently requested improved treatment, but they refrained from making similar requests for fear of being implicated, which is clear proof of their motives. They hope the public will understand.</p>
<p>Board Members Sent to Visit Director of Hubei Office</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, upon the instructions of Mayor Qian, is investigating the internal situation of the Xinxin Company. The company's board of directors appointed Xiao Zongjun and Cheng Hanxing as representatives to visit E Sen, the director of the First Division of the Bureau, at 9:30 AM yesterday. Director E stated that Mayor Qian is very concerned about the recent situation within the company and social stability, and instructed Xiao and Cheng to handle the matter properly. The two representatives replied that all business is proceeding as usual and that they will do their best to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Traitor's Testimony in Trial is Evasive</p>
<p>Wang Shiliang, a former printing worker at the Sino-American-Japanese Newspaper, harmed Xu Zhong, an underground worker for the Three People's Principles Youth League, while serving as a member of the ship escort team at the Changtai Transportation Company, leading to Xu's arrest by the enemy constabulary and severe torture. After the victory, Xu Zhong reported Wang's crimes of communicating with the enemy and organizing puppet troops to harm underground workers. Wang was arrested by the Shanghai Gendarmerie and handed over to the court. Yesterday, Chief Judge Liu Yugui of the High Court opened the trial. Wang Shiliang evasively claimed that he did not provide intelligence to the enemy puppets, receive firearms, or organize puppet troops. The court ordered further investigation and a future hearing, and the defendant was remanded to custody.</p>
<p>Shen Zhangming and Shen Zhaokui led enemy gendarmes to the home of their sworn brother, Zhu Dexing, at No. 4 Ma Lu Bridge, Gaoqiao, at 2:00 AM on the night of the 27th day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar. They broke down the door and took Zhu and his wife, Zhu Yingdi, to Zhaowa Island (now renamed Fuxing Island) in the Huangpu River, where they were detained. Zhu Yingdi was later released on bail by local villagers, but Zhu Dexing's whereabouts remain unknown, and his life or death is still unclear. After the victory, the two traitors were arrested by the Tiandunkou Police Station of the Gaoqiao Police Sub-Bureau and handed over to the High Court. The court opened the trial yesterday, with Judge Zhu Shaozhou presiding. However, both defendants evasively denied the charges. The court then summoned the victim, Zhu Yingdi, to testify about everything and ordered a future hearing.</p>

<h3>Floating Mine Discovered Near Zhaobao Mountain - More U.S. Fleet Ships Depart</h3>
<p>The original three ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo line are now operating. The Chuanshan ship was the first to withdraw and switched to the Dinghai-Wenzhou line. The Zhoushan ship was dispatched to Fujian the day before yesterday. Now, only the Jiangfeng ship is running. It returned to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Ningbo tomorrow morning. Tickets are already sold out. According to an announcement from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Zhenhai branch reported that there is a mine in the mud under the North City Reef, north of Zhaobao Mountain. It was previously guarded by police, but now no one is paying attention. The local Baozhang patrols it every three to five days. Although it is not within the shipping lane, ship captains should still be aware. More U.S. fleet ships have continued to leave Shanghai. Yesterday, a total of twenty-two ships departed, including the small transport oil tanker Duoxin, and their destination is unknown.</p>
<p>Salvage of Minyu Ship Encountering Obstacles</p>
<p>The salvage work on the Minyu ship, which suddenly sank at the No. 5 dock outside more than 20 days ago, has encountered obstacles because the thick cable tightly tied to the bow suddenly broke due to excessive lifting force. Only the stern has surfaced. It is heard that the company added night shifts last night to hopefully completely float the ship by this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Fourth Period of Flour Sales to be Improved</h3>

Those who pass the review can contact the designated location to arrange payment and pick-up procedures from the 17th to the 19th. The location and price will be announced in the newspaper on the 16th. For this period's payment, the UNRRA plans to increase the number of entrusted banks or locations to avoid overcrowding. For pick-up, the UNRRA is also considering delivering the flour directly to the applicant's shop to reduce the difficulties faced by applicants during pick-up and to check the applicant's actual situation. Regarding registration, the UNRRA has printed an application form that requires a reliable guaranteed shop number to prevent resale. Qualified applicants will be issued a flour purchase certificate.</p>

<h3>The First Inspection Team of the Control Yuan Accepts People's Petitions According to Law - All Staff Members Have Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After Japan's surrender, the First Inspection Team of the Control Yuan was transferred from Guizhou to work in the recovered areas. It traveled east from Chongqing, inspecting Yichang, Shashi, Wuhan, and other places along the way.

<h3>German Nationals Who Fail to Register by Deadline Will Be Sent to Concentration Camps</h3>
<p>The German Nationals Management Committee of this city has announced that some German nationals have still not registered since the German nationals registration process began. The Committee is now setting a deadline of the 15th, and all German nationals and other foreign nationals in this city who hold German passports must register with the Committee. Those who fail to register by the deadline will be subject to deportation to concentration camps. The registration procedures for German Jewish refugees will be specified separately by the Committee.</p>
<h3>Austrian Nationals Request Reconsideration of Repatriation</h3>
<p>[United Press Local News] After the Chinese government ordered the isolation and repatriation of Austrian nationals on November 27th of last year, the 4,650 Austrians in Shanghai were greatly alarmed. According to a statement by Austrian national representative Shi Duan, Austrian refugees should not be treated the same as German nationals. These people are not people subordinate to Germany, but citizens of the independent Republic of Austria. The Republic of Austria has not entered into a state of war with China, so Austrian refugees cannot be regarded as enemy nationals. The Austrian nationals in Shanghai have requested the Chinese government to reconsider this matter.</p>
<h3>First Phase of Low-Priced Cooking Oil Sales</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau has recently entrusted 94 members of the Miscellaneous Grains, Oil, Bean Cakes Trade Association to sell low-priced soybean oil, raw oil, and rapeseed oil. The selling price is 14,000 yuan per dan for soybean oil and 12,500 yuan per dan for rapeseed oil and raw oil. Retailers are allowed to take a legitimate profit of 15%. The sales volume is limited to a minimum of one catty and a maximum of five catties per person.

A total of 33 registered oil retailers have been approved, with an allocation of 2,849 city dan of rapeseed oil, limited to three catties per person at a price of 125 yuan per catty. Each retail store displays a cardboard sign issued by the association for identification. Citizens can report any retailer who hoards, conceals, exceeds the price limit, or provides an incorrect quantity, and they will be subject to a fine of 100 times the amount, as well as serious investigation.</p>
<h3>Granddaughter of Famous Doctor Xu Shaofu Sues Brother for Embezzlement of Inheritance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Xu Meijuan, the granddaughter of the famous doctor Xu Shaofu, is now 42 years old. She recently hired lawyers Cai Zhihe and Yang Zitang to file a lawsuit in the District Court, accusing her brother Xu Yaozhang of embezzling her inheritance and obstructing her freedom. Yesterday morning, Judge Lian presided over the interrogation in the Third Criminal Court of the District Court. The defendant was represented by lawyers Fei Xizhen and Wang Hengyi. The plaintiff alleged that Xu Shaofu left a large inheritance. Since the death of his wife, Ms. Gu, in 1941, it has fallen into the hands of his grandsons Yaozhang, Di San and their brothers. Xu Meijuan's own property was also embezzled. Although she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit at that time, she was forced to abandon the property in exchange for 25,000 yuan in puppet currency due to the influence of the enemy puppet forces, who leveraged pressure from the Japanese naval officer's office through her brother. Now that the homeland has been restored, she is demanding its return. The court ordered a future hearing.</p>

<h3>New Model Locomotives to Arrive Next Month, Powered by Diesel</h3>
<p>Transportation Minister of the Huazhong Railway Management Committee, Mr. Hou, told reporters that passenger transport on the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) lines is currently extremely crowded, with the number of passenger cars insufficient. There is no way to add new cars in the immediate future. Recently, old passenger cars have been repaired, and remaining freight cars have been modified, increasing the number of available passenger cars by twenty-four, which will be allocated to various train lines. In addition, six sleeper cars have been repaired and attached to first and second class night trains for the convenience of passengers. As for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, a large batch of transportation equipment and twenty locomotives destined for our country have not yet arrived, but are expected to arrive next month. Of these twenty locomotives, fourteen are scheduled to land at Wusong. The committee has repaired the Wusong wharf and installed special equipment to facilitate the landing of the locomotives, placing them directly onto the tracks for free movement. This project is quite large and was completed on the second of this month. These new locomotives are not powered by coal, but by diesel fuel, and our country's railways have not yet operated this type of new locomotive.</p>
<h3>Small Statistics on the Purchase Price of Gauze</h3>
<p>In August of the 32nd year [1943], the enemy puppets forced the purchase of gauze in this city. Relevant trade associations are now requesting the government to return the remaining portion. According to statistics, at that time, the market price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 1,500 yuan in puppet currency per bolt, while the purchase price was 375 yuan in puppet currency, only one-quarter of the value. Although two installments of bonus money were issued, due to the slow installment payments and the increase in cloth prices, even if the original goods were replenished upon receipt of the payment, the loss would be more than three-quarters. A table is provided below:</p>
<p>First installment, January 1, year 33 [1944]: Bonus money 0.0234375 taels, gold price at that time 78,000 yuan, equivalent to puppet currency 182.81 yuan, calculated at the same time cloth market 1,500 yuan, the value of the payment equals 121.9/1000 of the payment of the cloth.</p>
<p>Second installment, April 1, year 33: puppet currency 31.25 yuan, calculated at the same time cloth market 4,000 yuan, the value of the payment equals 7.8/1000 of the payment of the cloth.</p>
<p>Second installment, October 1, year 33: puppet currency 31.25 yuan, bonus money 0.0234375 taels, gold price at that time 540,000 yuan, equivalent to puppet currency 1265.63, calculated at the same time cloth market 8,000 yuan, the value of the payment equals 162.1/1000 of the payment of the cloth.</p>
<p>Third installment, April 1, year 34 [1945]: puppet currency 31.25 yuan, calculated at the same time cloth market 100,000 yuan, the value of the payment equals 0.3/1000 of the payment of the cloth.</p>
<p>The total payment received is 292/1000 of the payment of the cloth at that time. If calculated as a percentage, it is slightly less than three-tenths.</p>
<p>The outstanding payments are the fourth installment of puppet currency on October 1, year 34, the fifth installment of puppet currency on April 1, year 35 [1946], and the sixth installment of puppet currency on October 1, year 35, totaling puppet currency 93.75 yuan.</p>

<h3>Berliners in the Ruins</h3>
<p>— Anton</p>
<p>A dead lion is always more majestic than a dead dog. The remains of Berlin are more moving than the small towns of Aachen, Essen, or Cologne. The aura of glory and might is still faintly visible. In its deceased state, it retains a cold dignity.</p>
<p>However, one can tell that Berlin is an upstart city, not one of ancient lineage. Even before the war, Berlin was cold and awkward. It was not as magnificent as Rome, as comfortable as Paris, nor did it possess the solemnity of London. It is too new, lacking the charm and warmth of other ancient metropolises. Similarly, Berliners are a breed apart, quite different from the straightforward Germans of the southwest. They are arrogant and rude – outspoken and boorish, yet remarkably shrewd and adept at cunning.</p>
<p>Today, the Berliners living in the ruins are even more ill-tempered than before, their speech even more dangerous, their behavior even more crude. In this city, there is no trace of friendship. Walking on the street, listening to Berliners' conversations with each other, one can hardly believe that brotherly love, or even a sense of shared belonging, could allow such an appalling attitude to exist.</p>
<p>They seem to be venting their anger towards the enemy on their own people, erupting into curses at the slightest provocation, living in an atmosphere of constant tension and bestiality.</p>
<p>Because Berlin is now under the joint control of the victors, the air of tension is further increased. The Yalta Conference's decision for the United Nations to jointly occupy Berlin is like planting a time bomb. Clearly, the purpose of this approach is to save face for everyone. Berlin is divided into three zones, each controlled by one of the three powers. Currently, the only occupation of the three million clever, sharp-tongued, and desperate Berliners is to sow discord and spread rumors among the three powers.</p>
<p>At a public bartering market in West Berlin, I mingled with dozens of middle-class Germans. I spoke with a neatly dressed man carrying a greasy paper package. "This is a pound of bacon," he explained, "I traded a camera and several hundred marks for it." He used to be an engineer, with his office nearby. People immediately crowded around. Among the expressions of Berlin public opinion, the most interesting were the constant shifts in perspective and the skill of their speech.</p>
<p>As I got into my jeep, an old man suddenly touched my elbow and said: "Mr. Reporter, perhaps you can help us. Please tell the United Nations government to grant us an amnesty. If all the Nazis were released, we would be truly grateful. Of course, excluding the leading war criminals."</p>
<p>I feel that Berliners have not been completely defeated, nor have they been "liberated." They firmly believe that the destruction of Berlin and the destruction of Germany are only temporary phenomena. They have already begun to focus on the future. Three million people is not a small number. Three million people standing amidst what was once their home, now ruins, is quite dangerous. Although Berlin is no longer the center of a living political entity, it remains a barometer of the German psyche. Especially with winter approaching, the actions and reactions of these three million clever and violent Berliners, amidst hunger and despair, are truly worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>Cold and Heat</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>"Cold" and "heat" are two different feelings. Although these two different feelings appear distinct, both extremes can produce "pain." Therefore, extreme "heat" and "cold" will both bring pain to people. As psychologist Woodworth said, "Cold spots and warm spots give a kind of sharp pain to the stimulation of people's skin." Almost everyone has a psychology of disliking cold and heat. In the harsh winter, we always like to gather around the stove to avoid the cold. In the hot summer, we like to find a cool realm, enjoying the cool breeze and relieving the heat.</p>
<p>As for the weather, we certainly like the turn of spring and summer, or mid-autumn, because it's neither too cold nor too hot at this time, which is warmth. The reason why people are happy to pursue warmth is that warmth gives people a feeling of warmth and comfort, an indescribable pleasure. Most people are greedy for warmth. Who wants to get up right away from a warm bed? When describing the intensity of friendship, warmth is sometimes used as a metaphor. "Warm friendship" is so envious! The pleasure of mood is often said to be a "warm heart." Warmth makes people envious and nostalgic. Just think of the opposite of warmth: coldness, desolation, bleakness, and you will understand.</p>
<p>The feeling of "cold" and "heat" on the skin is different for everyone. This is due to the different skin reactions of each person. But extreme "cold" and "heat" are hated by anyone, that is certain. There is also "cold" and "heat" in human relationships. If they each go to extremes, there will be malpractices. To have a purely indifferent attitude towards others, even to hurt people with "hidden arrows," to mock people with "cold words," so that people dare not approach, is somewhat close to coldness. Where is the principle of being a person? There are also some people who claim to be "experienced in the world" and "rich in experience in dealing with people." They treat others entirely based on so-called "reason" (in fact, "reason" is not like this). They are stubborn by nature, rigid and self-willed, and unwilling to show any emotion to others. People should originally seek each other's sympathy and understanding. To get along with people solely on the basis of a so-called "rational" mind, how is this different from coldness? I think that except for people who live in an ice cellar, no one wants to encounter people as cold as ice. In addition, there is another type of person, whose emotions are particularly rich. They often pour out bursts of "enthusiasm" when getting along with relatives, friends, acquaintances, and new friends. What they believe in is Rousseau's famous saying "The spark of passion can revive the withered heart." Who doesn't need some passion to irrigate the withering heart in this cold society of human relationships? Who doesn't hope to find some passion from great friendship and beautiful love to comfort themselves?</p>
<p>People's psychology is not the same, and their likes and dislikes are different, so the natural expressions in their temperament will not be the same. Psychologists often divide people's personalities into two main categories: extroverted personality and introverted personality. The former likes to develop outward, likes to participate in social activities, has organizational interests, and the expression in personality is mostly the unrestrained emotions, bold and unrestrained. The latter likes to develop inward, likes to think quietly, has a relatively calm mind, and of course, there are also many people who are between these two personalities. Extroversion and introversion each have their biases. Allowing these two personalities to go to extremes will equally contribute to psychological unhealthiness and incompleteness of personality.</p>
<p>People with excessive enthusiasm often lack normal and appropriate reason. Their psychology is disturbed by excessive enthusiasm, causing their mental state to lose balance and their emotions to be unstable. Over time, it can lead to a "perverted personality." Many romantic writers in literary history, their works, intertwined with extremely strong enthusiasm, have touched countless readers, but eight or nine out of ten of these writers have suffered from varying degrees of "hysteria." Goethe and Shelley are prominent examples. A calm mind is good, but a cynical attitude is the "fatal wound" in our dealing with the world. To observe others coldly, treating them as objects of one's own "playing with" and "deliberating," is simply bullying others, belittling others, despising others, and oppressing others.</p>
<p>The most ideal thing is to maintain an objective and calm mind, carefully observe everything in society, and contribute one's own ability to society and the people with a warm heart of sympathy. To transform human life in the society to be more ideal and more advanced. Not a blind action without reason, nor a passive cold observation without work enthusiasm. Not an outsider, but a collaborator. Not a simple and pure calm, nor an unmodulated and extreme enthusiastic indulgence. This is a philosophy of life and a work attitude that contains "constructiveness."</p>

<h3>Treating Wounded Enemy Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Xingju</p>
<p>When the US Navy attacked Attu Island, the Japanese army resisted stubbornly, and many American soldiers were injured.</p>
<p>In the operating room on the ship, it was filled with wounded American soldiers waiting for treatment, but suddenly a wounded Japanese soldier was carried in. From his fierce expression, it could be seen that he was suppressing his fear. His body was filthy and stinking, making people want to vomit.</p>
<p>The American soldiers on the ship immediately clamored, "This is our enemy! So sinister, so despicable and filthy! He hates our American soldiers, kills our Americans! Why don't you throw him away, why don't you kill him!" How? You are going to use American medicine to treat him, use blood transfused by Americans to save him?"</p>
<p>At this time, Ito was afraid in his heart. He thought that the American soldiers would not stab him to death. They will torture him, cut off his ears, pull out his teeth, cut him into pieces, and chop him into minced meat!</p>
<p>The doctor on board ignored these voices. He ordered Ito to be carried into the operating room. He began to wash him, transfuse blood for him, perform surgery on him, cut off his destroyed leg, and carefully bandage him for a full hour.</p>
<p>Ito's expression gradually changed. He was sweating on his forehead, his lips trembling. "America! America!" He suddenly shouted, tears streaming down. Everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>After a few days, Ito's injuries had improved, and he was sent to a room below deck and locked up.</p>
<p>One day, a soldier talked to the doctor about this matter. The doctor said, "If I encountered Ito that day during the charge, I might have stabbed him to death with a knife. Maybe he had another bomb hidden somewhere. But our army did not stab him to death, but captured him, because in war it is sometimes worth the risk to capture the enemy. Since he was sent on board, he is a suffering human being. He has all the rights of a prisoner of war. We should respect this right, and our naval medical department should do its best to treat and save him."</p>
<p>"Do you treat him as carefully as you treat American soldiers?"</p>
<p>The doctor said, "Of course, doctors do not distinguish between high and low when saving lives. I treat the captain like this, and I treat the Japanese devils like this. Our treatment of Ito was like this: At first, we were entirely for military considerations. Our soldiers did not hesitate to risk their own lives to capture him, so I did not hesitate to use blood tests to save him, because Ito may be very valuable in military terms. Later, seeing that Ito had already boarded our ship, and his body was so filthy, we had to remove the damaged parts of his body and clean the remaining parts. This is not only for Ito, but also for our own sake. Finally, we are considering from a humanitarian point of view. I think that Ito's moved expression is indeed a very promising phenomenon."</p>
<p>The doctor continued slowly, "I think that we should treat the Japanese people in the same way as we treat this wounded soldier. We should remove the corrupt and toxic parts, but since we have to live with these people in the same world, we must treat the remaining part and restore it to a healthy state in body and mind."</p>
<p>Medicine</p>
<h3>The Toxicity of Vitamins</h3>
<p>— Moming</p>
<p>Vitamin D is toxic, and patients must not take it by themselves. Recently, a woman in the United States died from poisoning, which is the first case in medical history. The woman suffered from arthritis. She did not follow the doctor's instructions and took large amounts of vitamin D preparations, up to 100,000 to 500,000 units per day (the normal requirement is 400 units per day), continuously for up to a year. As a result, she developed calcification, with large amounts of calcium deposited in the heart, kidneys, blood vessels, and other places, which caused her death. The signs of chronic vitamin D poisoning are stomach weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle fatigue, lethargy, headache, and frequent urination, but because there is no doctor's supervision, it is not easy to detect and pay attention. Now, some people in the American medical community have proposed to include vitamin concentrate preparations in the category of poisons and prohibit patients from buying them themselves to avoid similar incidents.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3>Everyone, Respect Yourselves!</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yuliang</p>
<p>All status, high or low, is created by one's own efforts. Of course, if one has made a certain degree of effort and struggle, one will naturally enjoy a certain degree of status. This is the inevitable law of cause and effect.</p>
<p>After eight years of arduous war of resistance, our country has fulfilled its due responsibilities among the Allied countries in the world's smoke of gunpowder. Today, the world's fascists have been defeated, and our current enemy, the Japanese bandits, has surrendered! Amidst the chorus of celebrations around the world, our country is entering a new stage of building an independent, free, and democratic China at home. Internationally, our country ranks among the world's five great powers. In terms of international status, our country's status has increased. But this is entirely due to eight years of arduous war of resistance that produced today's brilliant results.</p>
<p>Now that we have attained a glorious status, we must also strive to consolidate the existing status. Because our enjoyment today is not a fluke, nor an accident, but rather accumulated through eight years of arduous process, at the cost of countless amounts of fresh blood. Therefore, we must never have the psychology of a nouveau riche, easy come, easy go. We can only respect ourselves and strive for self-improvement from now on.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the heart of our country and the easiest place for our people to get close to people from the Allied countries. Hence, it is also the place where our people have the easiest opportunity to show their character. Therefore, we must especially respect ourselves.</p>
<p>Recently, one can often see Allied soldiers walking through the streets with their chests out, but behind them, there are often three or five of our young people, holding embroidered towels in their hands, calling out "Want one! Want one!" as they follow them. Most of the Allied soldiers proudly shake their heads slightly and move forward, and then our young people retreat dejectedly. Of course, this is also a kind of business soliciting, but this scene invisibly forms two kinds of national character attitudes. And for international observation, it is really not very elegant.</p>
<p>In the expression of certain facts, we often can't help but ask others to do more self-examination, and not use the psychology and attitude of eight years ago to treat us again; but we should also do a lot of self-examination. Today, we can no longer use the psychology and attitude of eight years ago to deal with people from the Allied countries. Today, we should recognize that we have acquired a glorious, noble, and equal status, and we must first respect ourselves.</p>
<p>Of course, the above facts are just one example. In today's facts, there are more and greater existences. In short, we must all respect ourselves and work hard. New relationships must have new expressions to establish firmness. Because everything, when despised by outsiders, must first have its own worthy of being despised.</p>

<h3>Common Sense of Respecting the National Flag</h3>
<p>— Yijun</p>
<p>The national flag is a symbol representing the country, and its dignity and sacredness are self-evident. Yet some people still do not understand its importance, and often hang it arbitrarily, fold and place it improperly, and there are various phenomena such as the national flag being damaged, discolored, or the size being incorrect. Moreover, it is exposed to wind and rain, or it is flown in the dark of night, which damages the national image and loses dignity. All nationals should pay special attention to this. Since the city police department implemented the "Hanging of the National Flag" uniformly, the city's appearance has been renewed. Under the clear blue sky and white sun, it is not only a spectacular view, but also the national flag suddenly appears majestic and flying high.</p>
<p>The national flag should be raised at sunrise and lowered at sunset. It has a certain fixed method. After the flag is lowered, it should not be rolled on the flagpole, or thrown into the corner of the wall, or propped up in the corner of the wall, allowing it to be stained by dust and dirt. The placement method is provided below for reference. If you take down the national flag, lay it flat and fold it once on each side, up and down, left and right, so that it becomes a quarter of its original size, then put the national emblem up, but absolutely never fold it again. It is best to make a wooden flat box, or use white paper and cloth to wrap it. This way, it will not be soiled and will be dignified and respectful. This simple common sense is truly something that every national should know.</p>
<h3>Deliberately Making Things Difficult or Abusing Civilians?</h3>
<p>To buy a train ticket at the Shanghai ×× agency, one needs to ask for connections, otherwise it is difficult to get one. At the train station to buy third-class tickets, the Shanghai-Hangzhou line has one window for Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Songjiang, and one window for small stations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Unexpectedly, yesterday, buying a ticket back to Chang'an in Shanghai, when I arrived at the station, it was terrible. Starting from the window, the queue went all the way to Baoshan Road, a distance of at least a mile. It was two o'clock when I arrived. Although there were still more than ten hours until the train's departure, after waiting for half an hour, it still did not move a step. Fearing that waiting for a ticket for a long time would cause me to miss the train and have to spend another night, I changed to buying a second-class ticket. How could I know that there are two ticket offices for second-class tickets? May I ask, villagers and children all know that there are more people taking third-class trains and fewer people taking second-class trains. Now, the Shanghai-Hangzhou line has a total of twenty-one stations, and third-class passengers account for eight-tenths of the total, while second-class passengers account for two-tenths of the total. Now there are two ticket offices for second-class tickets, and only one ticket office for third-class tickets. May I ask, is this deliberately making third-class passengers wait for several hours to buy tickets? Or can ordinary civilians be abused at will?</p>

<h3>Request to the Municipal Government to Construct Municipal Housing within a Limited Time</h3>
<p>— Shen Huaxing</p>
<p>This year is a year of construction. Among the construction issues in Shanghai, the most urgent problem that needs relief and resolution is the housing shortage. Since the eight years of the War of Resistance, the number of houses destroyed in areas around the city center, such as Nanshi, Zhabei, Hongkou, Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Nantao, is countless. Therefore, a large portion of citizens and refugees are crammed into small rooms, with dozens of people living in a single room, which is extremely pitiful. Nowadays, renting a municipal house or a regular house is as difficult as ascending to the heavens. The phenomenon of housing shortages is prevalent everywhere, and the brokerage fees and rents are shockingly high, unlike before the war, when one could rent a house by paying only three months' rent as a deposit. Therefore, I implore the municipal government to construct the destroyed houses within a limited time. At the very least, it should aim to restore the pre-war state within two years. This is truly a construction that brooks no delay and a benevolent policy that benefits the people's livelihood. At the beginning of this victorious year, I offer this humble opinion to the municipal government, hoping it will be adopted and implemented!</p>

<h3>Vagrants Starting Anew (Part 2): Impressions of Visiting the Caohejing Shelter</h3>
<p>— Dong Yan</p>
<p>There are children standing guard in the corners, monitoring those who are willing to be degenerate and escape. Many "white powder ghosts" (referring to addicts) have kicked their habits and are sunbathing on the grass. Those who have realized earlier are given positions to be more free. The ferocious ones are confined until they repent. The entire management is militarized. The director, Zhou Zuwang, a graduate of Normal University, is willing to do the work of an unsung hero, which is truly rare. The other staff members also receive meager salaries and do heavy work. They treat the shelter as a large family, caring for it, protecting it, and hoping it will grow and take on part of the responsibility for the construction work.</p>
<p>After nearly four hours of stay, this shelter gave me a very satisfactory impression. They are not only passively providing shelter, they treat the sick, help refugees and children overcome addiction, and then teach them to start anew, to do the work they should do. Especially the children, because they are easier to change, almost all of them abide by the rules and reform themselves. Imagine that five or six hundred children grow up and can take two paths: one is that they are all good citizens, producers, the second generation of individuals; the other path is that they are still wandering on the streets, begging, stealing, and growing up to be hooligans and thieves. How much difference does the impact of these two completely different paths have on society?</p>
<p>Please, every conscientious citizen, think about it: for the country, for society, and also for yourself, we must save this group of people. We must not only enable them to live, but also make them useful to do things for society and do their best for the country.</p>
