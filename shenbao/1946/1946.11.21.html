<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕共產黨辦事處發言人廿日晚稱：頃根據彭德懷宣布，延安周圍政府軍隊已達十萬人，陝甘寗邊區南北西三面被圍，南綫爲胡宗南部一六五旅及一二三旅，在洛川中部一帶，第一飾及第四十九師在輯城，宜川一帶，北錢原爲第廿二軍，在榆林，神木兩地。最後有第廿八旅由咸陽空運抵榆林，兩綫馬鴻逵部第八十二師一個騎兵旅，三個地方性的保安團隊集結靈武。西綫於十七日下午十一時已開始，北綫於十六日開始，南綫於十三日開始，延安業已緊張萬分，雄備隨時作戰，此乃自一九三五年十月以來，陝甘寗邊區從未有過之戰事。此項戰事不僅是存在，且已開始，至報載朱德，毛澤東離延安訊，實不確。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿日電〕中共發言人梅益正式宣布：國軍已向延安區發動鉗形攻勢，此爲政府欲消滅中共之最大企圖之信號。梅氏稱：馮鴻逵部隊四旅的四萬人，十七日晚自延安以西一百四十哩之鹽池向延安進攻，並謂：十三日胡宗南部隊在延安區南部邊境與共軍發生小接觸。周恩來會於十六日記者招待會中稱：若政府進攻延安，則中共將自上海·南京·北平各地撤退，並停閉軍調總部。此間一般人士相信，全面內戰展開後，中共將在全國各地進行地下工作，同時「延安人」將再發動蒙古與東北「長征」。</p>
<p>〔又電〕延安電台廿日廣播稱　國軍先頭部隊已突入延安邊區十九哩，業與中共軍隊發生接觸，是爲國軍對赤都大規模進攻之先聲。</p>
<h3>葉劍英仍留平</h3>
<p>其他共黨人員已撤退</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕葉劍英廿日上午往訪梁漱溟，與梁氏話別。軍調部中中共發言人稱，今日軍調部之延安聯絡班機，共方僅有三人搭機返延，葉劍英仍留平候命。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕軍調部共產黨人員事實上已在陸續撤退中，關內僅留之太原，東沁，候馬等小組，俱將陸續撤退，長春軍調分部共方，亦決定將東北小組人員撤退至哈，聞長春分部政府與美方人員十九日已得到共產黨參謀長，伍修權之通知，同時政府方面亦考盧東北小組政府人員撤退問題。</p>

<h3>淶水易縣方面　共軍進攻未逞</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕平漢北段共軍，十八日晚在徠水·易縣間集中三十個團，猛攻門墩子山及蠍子山方面國軍，雙方激戰至十九日午間，共軍二個旅被擊潰，十九日夜共軍復以三個旅猛攻徠水西南十餘里之南北溝，但未獲逞，廿日晨退去，該方面正醞釀次一大規模攻勢，雙方主力均集中於此。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿日電〕共軍野戰第十一旅，刻由保定東的十五公里之劉家口向高陽縣流竄，大肆搜括食糧，其野戰第一旅，則盤據定縣西北蘇泉及磚路鎭一帶，意岡威脅平漢路望都以南交通之修復。又定縣西南之行唐，爲共軍野戰第二旅部隊所盤據，刻正强徵靑年壯丁，授以破路，埋雷等訓練。</p>

<h3>彭部長答記者問　國大共黨民盟代表席次決予保留　綏靖區政務會議今閉幕</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕中宣部記者招待會，廿日下午三時半假國大會黨代表休息室舉行。出席彭學沛，沈怡，葉公超，貝爾及中外記者的兩百人，首由彭氏介紹新任京市長沈怡，出席報告京市初步施政方針，旋答覆記者詢問，至五時許散會。茲誌彭部長答問如次：</p>
<p>間：中共發言人稱：陝北國軍調動頻繁，空中飛機時過延安，西安以北之公路，亦積極整修，謂國軍即將進攻延安確吾？</p>
<p>答：此種空氣或爲宣傳策略，且爲有行動之先聲，此與中共新成立之行動委員會，不無關係。榆林被包圍已數週，聯絡唯靠空軍，故須經過延安上空。至於整修公路，乃全國性者，西安以北之交通不能除外。</p>
<p>問：請坦白相告政府是否正計劃進攻延安？</p>
<p>答：前題已有否定之回答。</p>
<p>問：傳聞蔣主席近召集各地國軍高級將領開會，席上並稱五個月消滅共軍，五年肅淸中國之共產主義，確吾？</p>
<p>答：此傳聞或係對最近所開之綏靖區政務委員會會議，該會以宋院長，白部長爲正副委長，任務爲策劃綏靖區之復員與救濟，出席者有中央各有關部會人員及各綏靖地區之軍政長官，並非召集所有高級將領開會，如陳總長即未出席，主席曾至該會訓話，但對訓話內容之如此臆測，實無否定之價値。該會已繼續三日，廿一日即將閉幕。</p>
<p>問：主席曾與張君勱交換文件知否？</p>
<p>答：書札往還，乃平常事，唯可相告者，即民社黨出席國大一點，有極大可能。回溯民國廿七年首屆參政會成立，會中份子除無黨無派者外，以國民黨，共產黨，靑年黨，民社黨（曩稱國社黨）四黨爲主，嗣民主同盟成立，乃以靑年黨，民社黨爲主幹，而摻以敎育團體及少數個人，目前情形恰與廿七年相似，反對參加國大者，僅共產黨，吾人對敎育界，無黨無派人士及蒙　同胞之出席國大，共同制憲，極感愉快，與會代表對彼等亦自爲歡迎</p>
<p>問：司徒美堂領導之民治黨，是否在國大獲得席决？</p>
<p>答：司徒先生已以僑民資格被邀出席國大。</p>
<p>問：共產黨及民盟旣不參加國大，政府是否以其席次分配其他各黨？</p>
<p>答：否。共產黨及民盟之代表席次，絕對予以保留。</p>
<p>問：國府委會之改組，是否已進行？</p>
<p>答：各黨派參加國大之工作尚未完或。</p>
<p>問：國大代表中有遷都北平之議，聞京市參議員聆訊後，集議反對之，準備遊行請願，確吾？</p>
<p>答：未聞此訊，陳議長裕生亦從未提及此事。（葉公超·沈怡兩氏談話，見第二版）</p>

<h3>中英通商條約商訂中　我方正研究對稿　政府尚未接收大連市</h3>
<p>葉公超答記者問</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕外交部歐洲司長葉公超，廿日午後於中外記者招待會上，對大述近况，中·英商的交涉，及中·法越南協完實施談判情形，有所報告，茲將問答　誌如次；</p>
<p>問：北平電傳蘇軍已自大連撤退，由中共軍隊接收，蘇軍是否已撤，大述情形如何，中國政府有何消息？</p>
<p>答：關於此事，中國政府並米接到報告，蘇聯政府曾於本年五月廿三日照會吾國，謂蘇軍已於五月三日自東北撤退完畢，自彼時起，大連方面不當再有蘇軍駐防，因去年八月所簽中·蘇條約，並不允許蘇聯在大連駐兵也。大連附近地區，仍爲共軍所佔，中國政府未接收大速，故無其他消息。</p>
<p>問：中·英商的交涉之情况如何？</p>
<p>答：中·英商訂通商及有關條約，英國方面於六個月前曾向中國政府提出一切初稿，外部現正研究對稿，對稿中若干條款，涉及政府其他有關部門，各方正就有關條款研究中。外部期於本月底以前對此對稿完成，惟因牽涉廣泛，可能略費時日。然中國政府與英國政府，固同樣希望該的早日完成。</p>
<p>問：關於中·法越南交涉，前滇省參會曾提出六點意見，不悉中法越南協定實施談判情形如何？</p>
<p>答：中·法談判，可分四要點叙述：（一）收回滇越鐵路滇段，乃政府一貫政策，政府對外交涉，一向重視各方意見，雲南省參議會之意見，自爲政府所重視。（二）海防關爲自由港問題，政府正與法方交涉中，已獲有眉目，絕對可望成功。（三）戰時越境公私物資損失，正交涉賠償，因涉及調查，估價，幣値訂定等問題，將費時間較久。（四）華僑保障問題，政府正密切注意中，同時，政府並與法越雙方交涉，俟交涉獲有結果，則實施之後，華僑非僅可獲得保障，且可享受較前較佳之待遇，此則可斷言者。</p>
<h3>沈怡在記者招待會中　報告京施政方針　本大處着眼小處着手原則進行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕京市長沈怡二十日在中宣部記者招待會中，報告初步施政方針，略稱：對市政建設進行，一本大處着眼，小處着手之原則，大處爲完成地方自治之一般準備及都市計劃，小處爲修繕道路水道，不大不小處，爲便利交通，解決房荒。學校荒，小之又小處，爲整潔陋巷僻地，乃至添建公共厠所等。並謂：施政成功之條件，在於市府職員之勤苦努力，市民之成意協助，中央之體諒支持，輿論之指導監督，旋答覆記者問題如下：</p>
<p>問，南京之建設目標爲中式抑西式，抑或中西合璧？</p>
<p>答，不問中西，以現代化之都市爲目標。</p>
<p>問，沈市長對京市舞禁觀點如何？</p>
<p>答，此係市政中小之又小之事，各方旣均注意，市參議會亦將討論，當先聽取大家意見。</p>
<p>問，京市財政困難，收支不能平衡，沈市長有何策劃？</p>
<p>答，感謝各位關心京市收支不平衡之難題，實非議稅收可得解決，但亦必設法求取解決。</p>

<h3>港警踢斃小販案開審　兇犯之罪證確鑿　但在英國法律保護下可能無罪</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港十九日電〕印度籍警察塞特踢斃我花生米小販王水祥一案，今日下午開審，庭內觀衆充塞警衛森嚴，華人四名，被召作證，其中一人證明，被告警察在死者栽倒地上後，曾將死者的踢十次。港政府附屬醫院醫師郝爾威，騐出王水祥之死，乃由於腹內流血及脾臟破裂所致。郝爾威並表示，王水祥屍上之瘀傷，乃由被告所着之皮靴所踢，已屬無疑。</p>
<p>該案根據檢察官起訴詞及其盤問證人口供之情形觀察，被告可能在英國法庭保護下，被判無罪，或僅受輕微處分。檢察官首謂：彼僅向法庭陳述有關該案之事實，並謂：在控方面各證人之供詞，間有矛盾，惟有聽法庭判斷。檢察官於盤查出庭作證之負責檢騐死者造體之警官時，曾提出問題謂：死者身上之瘀痕，可能係因仆於落花生簍上受傷所致，死者因脾臟發大四倍，爆裂致死，設使及早送至醫院或可救治，該案押候二十日下午再審。</p>

<h3>社論　樹立民族的新風範</h3>
<p>自立法院因程序問題暫停審議憲草修正案後，各方對於憲草問題，寄予莫大之關注。憲草修正案的擬訂，原本基於政協的決議，是項修正案的是否將被提出國大，不特有關政府的信義，抑且有關整個大局的前途。爲此，本報前曾若論，對憲草問題有所論列；認爲三民主義憲法的草訂，沒有成規可循，一切事屬首創。五五憲草的制擬，前曾化了極大的努力，固然充分反映了三民主義的精神，但其所定的制度，鑒於近十年來，尤其是最近幾年來的演變，是否最合理想，要亦不無疑問。至此次政府所擬提交國大的修正憲草，於遵守政協決議之中，仍舊一本三民主義的嚴正立塲，應該可爲國大制憲的依據。至於程序問題，祇要中常會一有決議，未始不能及時使其合於規定。</p>
<p>現在憲草修正案果經巾常會通過，交立法院迅予完成立法程序，同時又通過了國府組織法修正案；國防最高委員會也通過了行政院組織法修正案；各案內容，又均遵照政協決議精神。此項議案的通過，一方面固然可以使立法院之審議憲草修正案，得以合乎法定的程序，及時審議完竣提付國大；一方面却又在昭示國人，就是政協所通過的決議，政府對之如何遵守信義決意採行。一切無稽之談，觀乎中常會此次的決議，當可不攻自破。政府重視它自己所作的諾言，自不輕易許其有所變更。除非在茲本的立塲以外，中央的不持己見，實在應該感動各黨各派乃至無黨無派的人士。「相信我們的主義，纔能做我們的國民」這種不合時宜的觀念，雖或不免依舊存留於若干人之腦際，但決不能代表一個一本天下爲公的政團。這是那些表面上揚言提倡民主，實際上無個人自由崇尚集權主義的政團。纔有這種可怕的觀念。</p>
<p>中常會所通過的國府組織法修正案，除國府主席由中常會選任外，置國府委員四十人，包括黨內外人士，並將國府委員會的權力予以擴大；同時國防最高委員會所通過的行政院組織法修正案，除交通改設運輸郵電兩部，新設地政，水利，衛生三部外，又設政務委員。凡此決議，悉運政協決議精神；長政府之決意遵守並實行政協的決議，於此可見。由於此項修正案的通過，國府及政院的改組，以容納各黨各派乃至無黨無派的人士，必能加速進行。我們願各方人士能從此更加精誠合作，使國府及政院的組織，能够更加充實，以樹立民主統一的新風範，民族前途，從此又增加其光明。</p>
<h3>整飭邊政不容忽視</h3>
<p>當國內的局勢，因國大的召開而呈着新機運的時候，我們不要忽視了來自邊疆的消息與意向。日前國大內蒙代表，參政會全體內蒙參政員曁其它蒙疆人士，在京集會，發表宣言，要求自治，並請中央澈底實行二中全會對邊政的決議案，刷新邊政。同時，據美國聯合社自洛杉磯傳來的消息，又謂新疆纏回，近又蠢蠢欲動，「東土耳其斯坦人民井和國」的舊夢，又有死灰復燃之勢。此項報道，來自太平洋彼岸的洛杉磯，其眞確的程度如何，不無可疑。照我們的判斷，前項報道，不免有張大其辭之處，未必可信；但旣有如上的報道，也着實値得我們的警惕。　我們之應該重視我們的邊政，是無須我們加以强調的。新疆蒙古爲我國北方及西北方的屏藩，當茲時會，允應値得我們的注意。蒙疆在過去八年中，有的曾遭淪陷，飽嘗日本軍閥侵略的苦味，迨日寇投降，又遭國軍以外的武裝部隊及中共的統治。所以當他們正慶山河的重光，郤又遭受了另一暴力統治的惡遝；因此，對於蒙疆同胞，我們應該表示萬分的同情和慰藉。中央關注邊民，在去歲日本投降以後，曾有蒙旂宣慰團的派遺。由於最近局勢的發展，蒙疆一帶不免蒙受了不安的影響。從外國通訊社傳來的消息，一則謂外蒙眾隊刻正向察省邊界一帶集中；再則謂外蒙軍事常局，現正採取嚴格措施，防止任何人自察省越過邊界而入外蒙。此項消息的眞確性雖尚有待於證實，然蒙邊情勢的不安，似乎無可加以否認。</p>
<p>正在這個時候，我們郤看見有蒙古人士要求自治的呼聲。據報載消息，蒙古同胞的要求自治，並不在分裂，而在要朮政府實踐三番五次對蒙古人民所作的諾言。我們相信這句話的　出於蒙旂同胞的肺腑。蒙旂同胞隔戈壁與外殲相望，對於外蒙的實情，知之較切，加以中共的暴力統治，他們也知之有素；所以他們的心理內向，而不在分裂，我們贊佩蒙旂同胞能够有這樣坦白的表示。中央對於　政的關注，在二中全會原有重要的決議，一則曰在根據三民主義，五　憲法組成統一民主國家之原則下，憲法中須明白現定保障邊疆民族之百治極利；再則曰改組後之國府委員及行政院之政務委員，均須有　·藏·回三族忠實幹續之同參加；再則　，蒙·藏·回三族賢能人士，須有充分機會參加各院部會實際工作；再則曰改組蒙藏委員會爲邊政部，使蒙·藏·回三族幹練人士得參加實際工作，担負實際責任；再則曰在邊疆民族所在地各級之施敎，應注重本族文字，對於邊疆各地自治制度，須按照各該地實際情形，作合理之規定，其關於內蒙部份，恢復原有之蒙古地方自治政務委員會，並明白劃分盟旂政府與省縣界之權限。凡此決定，本報曩曾著論，有所評述，認爲「這次國民黨二中全會的決議，於擴大邊地同胞參加中樞的機會外，着重在扶殖邊地同胞的自治，與維護邊地同胞的自治，與維護邊地同胞的固有文化生活，不特足以表示中央對邊地同胞的關注，抑亦爲他們此後的發展開拓了一條大道」。可遺憾的是二中全會以後，國內的局勢，依舊未能趨於平靖，致前項決策未能實行；如今局勢旣有變更，而蒙胞又有自治的要求，籲請中央實行決策。我們上體中央關注邊民的德意，同情蒙胞的遭遇，因此，希望能將二中全會關於邊政的決議，一一及時逐漸付諸實施，以慰邊民喁喁之望。</p>
<p>至於關於新疆部份，從美國傳來的消息，未必可信，前已言之。但我們於此不能不再有所申說的就是中央本革命之三民主義，爲期調協邊民安定疆圉起見，於本年一月間旣有伊寧糾紛事件和解條款正文十一條之簽訂，於本年六月間復成立附文二件，同時又擴大新疆省政府之組織，由居住新疆各族分任委員；又見中央對於邊民自治，盡力扶持，凡邊民願望之可以得能滿足者，均使其得到滿足。此種開明政策，應爲邊民所共戴；則如何協和各族，消除猜忌，以臻衷誠合作，當爲新疆各族一致努力的中心。茲因有前項報道的傳來，用特重申我們的所見；願國人其共勉之。</p>

<p>上月某日筆者適由總工會會議畢，頗覺疲憊，步抵小北門時擬搭六路車，詎料候至十五分鐘左右，未見有車駛來，正在不耐煩時，遙見三五輛同時駛來，待車抵站時，第一輛因車中已滿載乘客，故車門未開即行駛去，第二輛車未停穩，乘客蜂擁車門前，車廂內乘客較前車爲稀，駕駛員和賣票員都嚷着「後面有空車子」，言未竟，車已開動，於是一般乘客均紛紛趨向後面幾輛車子，車廂裏當然較前二輛空得多，可是售票員不的而同地嚷着「後面空」「後面空」，一方面把呌子一吹，三輛車子飛也似地尾追而去了，一般乘客均表示出失望和憎恨的樣子在詛咒着；「他媽的！老子自己會走」，「跑吧，跑吧」，有幾個不耐煩等候的一面詛咒着一面跑了。　天色漸漸地暗下來，筆者好得傍晚返家，閒　無事，索性再等一等，同時抽這當口看看路旁修理三輸車的純熟的小技工作，極作無聊中消遺品，不知不覺地又等下了十多分鐘，遠遠地接連開到四輛，第一第二輛乘客擠得滿滿的，故米停車即行開去，第三第四輛較空，車未停穩乘客已爭先恐後地向車門前擁住，可是照舊的售票員用手指指向後面，口中呼着「後面空車子來了」，結果第三第四輛文未開門就開去了，這時候維者亦未免暗暗地太息了一聲，接連地又聽到乖客們謾罵不已；「中國人辦的事總是辦不好的」，這句話使人聽「太傷心了！筆者雖是一個小小的公務員，但是絕圣水願勝利後的老百姓對國營的事業仍有這樣輕視的惡　！所以提出下面幾點意見，希望趙局長及車務間負責人員加以注意和改良。（一）車輛銜接而駛同時抵站，是否售票員有使查票員首尾不及兼顧之作用？（二）車廂內旣有空餘地位，抵站時爲何不開門容納乘客。（三）老西門爲起站點，管理派車者爲何不勻配相隔時間而使數輛同時開出？（四）在這中外交通工具競爭的上海，駕駛員和售票員對乘客們的禮貌，應有改進一的必要，倘無相當的訓練，與洋商所辦的無優劣分別，則每天乘客改乘洋商車輛的漏巵，日積月累，不能說不是國家的損失。（五）最好能指派幾位流動的稽查員，車事查察　駕駛員及售票員是否守職並可給予乘客們上車下車時的　願。（六）任何事業對於生活上沒有相當的報酬，流弊和不忠職務的事情很易發生，所以對於服務人員的待遇亦應該合理化，否則即使能將以上數點改善，亦不過是一個治標而不治本的辦法，因爲工作效率是　於工作情緒，而服務精神是寓於服務興趣的（章致）</p>
<p>回溯八一三滬戰猝發，日寇於金山衛海口乘隙登陸（是年十一月五日），東南半壁，幾全淪陷於敵寇之手。所以痛定思痛，似應以金山衛海防之潰退爲最創鉅痛深。按金山衛城爲明繼戚光防倭所築，不意三百餘年後　一日寇破門竄入。故爲警惕國民重視海防精練海軍計，爲紀念此次抗戰所遭受之重大損害計，爲追悼因金山衛突然失守而被犧牲之人命財產計，似均應有所表示。或於我國之大都市中指定一道路，定名爲金山衛路，（以上海之街道易名爲最妥）或於金山衛城附近日寇首先登陸之處，建立碑事，以資警惕而備紀念，均有深長意義者也。（公度）</p>

<p>覆王虎城君：來函指陳郵信被擱一則，頃由上海郵政管理局復稱：「查得該鄞縣寄王君收平信一件，確有延誤，原因目前本局及鄞縣局收發郵件眾多，辦理較遲所致，茲已飭　改進並函請鄞縣局注意。惟戰件確於上月十三日妥投，因工君同居當日未及遞交，以致　置一天，已由王君具函證明，關於信件投遞後時有被門房或同居者誤擱情事，亦經本局一再通告公衆注意。」特達。</p>

<h3>聯全國全體大會通過　停止宗教種族歧視</h3>
<p>顧維鈞闡明孔子哲學博得全場鼓掌</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十九日專電〕聯大會今日首次舉行五十四國之投票，並一致通過埃及提出之決議案，請各國政府「立即停止宗教上及所謂種族上迫書與歧視」。反對者僅南非總理史未資一人，渠於大會討論決議時，獨立一旁，冷然閱報，蓋以印度會對南非提出種族歧視之證賣也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十九日電〕聯合國大會本日開會，討論埃及對於種族上與宗教上之歧視所提出之議案。埃及代表奧迪安首先發言稱，埃及所提出之議案，實可視爲「善勝惡這象徵」，波關代表對之，率直表示附議，並謂波蘭蒙受種族上歧視，痛苦備　。蘇聯代表即該國外次維辛斯聲亦竭力贊成此項議案，但謂此項議案過於抽象，並不能指出反對排斥之實際辦法。至此中</p>
<p>維鈞博士起立發言稱，埃及代表所提出之議案，與聯合國憲章完全符合，中國代表團對此，完全表示贊同。此項議案雖未有任何具體之規定，但現仍有許多國家未能尊重人類平等之觀念，故中國代表對於埃及之義案，表示無限歡迎。至於中國則在五千年以前，早已尊重人類平等。一原則，時至今日，亦將此等原則，付儲實施。中國境內有漢滿蒙回藏五種不同之民族，其所信仰之宗教，足以代表全世界所有之宗教，但仍能和平相處，相安無事，實乃中國能實施人類平等之原則有以致之。中國至　先師孔子之　有曰，「四海之內皆兄弟也」，吾人無時不以孔子之遺教爲念，切實遵行，深望大會能一致通過埃及所提出之議案。蘇代表維　斯甚表示蘇聯雖將投票成該案，惟覺該案之未能列舉事實國名，復未建議防止歧視行之具，　措施，實爲美中不足。美代表奧斯汀英代表蕭克羅斯亦相繼發言，支持該決議案。　氏並表示擁護維辛斯　之意，指出僅有言辭及決議案，猶嫌未足，故英國常盡力於太屆大會中完成人權委員會，以規定人類基本權利之法典。印代表則謂，此項議案，因其爲確定人類不問其爲白種人黑種或黃種人間完全平等之一大步驟，深望此項議案能獲得一致通過，並望各國代表返國後，能研究其本國之情形，而設法覓致方法，以補救任何現行之歧視。最後由法代表巴洛迪發言稱，法代表國對此義案表示贊同，但余欲告各位，法國從未容許任何種族上的歧視，此等歧視，與法國人民之精神絕不相符云。</p>
<h3>安理會改選理事　哥敘比三國當選　社經會理事美黎重選蟬聯</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐約十九日電〕聯合國大會本日選出哥倫比亞，叙利亞及比利時爲安理會非常任理事國，任期兩年。「聯大」全會並選舉委內瑞拉及紐西蘭爲社會經濟理事會理事國，任期三年，美國及黎巴嫩亦獲重選連任。經社理事會尚缺二席，惟因投票結果未足三分之二，四候選國（土本其·荷蘭·白俄羅斯及南斯拉夫）均未獲選。大會主席斯巴克遂宣佈留待下次全會決定。由於本日選舉結果，明年安理會十一理事國將爲：五常任理事國（美·英·中·蘇·法）及澳洲，巴西及波蘭（上述三國任期於一九四七年年終屆滿）與今日選出之哥倫比亞，叙利亞及比利時。明年經社理事會理事國將爲：古巴，捷克·印度·挪威·蘇聯·英國（任期於一九四七年年終屆滿）比利時·加拿大·智利·中國·法國·秘（於一九四八年年終屆滿）及今日選出之四國（美國·委內瑞拉·黎巴嫩及紐西蘭）及尚未選出之兩國，其任期均止於一九四九年終。</p>
<p>印度落選</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約二〕十日電〕安理會當選三理車國，係經秘密投票選出者。據悉，印度曾極力要求在安理會中獲得一席，以代替埃及，且得中蘇英三國之支持，但印度僅得十三票，居第四位終爲落選。選舉結果表示安理會之份子仍保持已往區域分配辦法，哥倫比亞代表拉丁美洲，叙利亞代表阿拉伯集團，比利時代表西歐諸國。哥倫比亞係繼墨西哥之任，叙利亞繼埃及，比利時繼荷蘭。在實際選舉舉行前，尚經過甚多之幕後活動，其結果早已預定，選舉僅使其例行手續而已。</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫主張　義南直接談判</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十九日合衆電〕莫洛托夫通知義大利謂，蘇聯主張南義直援談判，以圖解決特港與南義邊境問題，莫氏於致義駐蘇大使加羅米（現在紐約爲義出席四强外長會議代表團員）函，路運蘇聯之地位。莫洛托夫謂，蘇聯實成莘托所提之逮議，舉行直接談判，並稱，蘇政府相信義南兩國直接談判、可以協議精神解決此問題，恢復義南正常關係。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦十九日電〕莫斯科電台今日廣播回敎聖城麥加電稱：沙地阿拉伯財長蘇利門發表計劃，擬利用新近　美國借得之信用放款，在波斯灣建築一新港。蘇氏係於本年八月間赴華盛頓，與進出口銀行商得借款一千萬美元，以備在美購置貨物。所建新港，將以三百哩長之鐵道，與腹地里雅達城聯絡，其設備均將購自　國，里雅達與曼狄那擬建築電力廠，亦用美國備。</p>

<h3>安理會昨開會討論　國外駐軍問題　五強即可筣會商討否決權</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十日廣播：安理會今日下午開會，討論最困難之問題，即同盟國駐於非敵國軍隊數量之問題。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約二十日電〕五强可望於今日恢復討論中英美三國所提限制否決權使用之方案。按五强會議昨日臨時撤銷，原因並未宣布，想係因聯合國同時舉行全體大會，外長不克分身之故。貝文昨晨曾晤貝爾納斯，諒曾就德國問題及巴勒斯坦問題交換意見。</p>
<h3>英對德國問題　決定六項方針</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十九日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃談稱，英美法蘇四國，不久將在紐約舉行會議，討論德國問題，屆時英國所當辯護之立塲，業已加以明確之規定。貝文外相聞已擬就備忘錄一件，說明英國所持之論據，質言之，有下列六項：（一）英國主張德國應依照一種制度，旣非中央集權制，亦非聯邦制，在政治上及經濟上獲得統一。（二）英國認爲德國之生產量，依照波茨坦協定所規定者，尚嫌不足，故應准許德國每年生產鋼鐵一萬一千噸，以其所得之現金，用以購買食物（三）在現行賠償計劃之下，不論蘇聯或西方國家，若欲自德國搬走任何設備者，英國均表示異議，即使蘇聯提議分期扣除，英國亦不能苟同。唯有至德國生產量增加，足以供給盟軍佔領經費及給養時，英國始能放棄此項見解。（四）英國寗願英美兩國佔領區實行合併，而不願成立協定，使蘇聯在德國依賴英國補足期內，得自德國搬走設備，作爲賠償。（五）英國仍願在德國統一之機構內，邀請蘇聯參加管制魯爾區之工業。（六）英國擬提議，準備組織德國中央機構，設立一中央公務員團，並任命各地方政府之機關，在政治上得有採取決定之權，但最後仍須呈請佔領各國之批准。</p>
<h3>美國草擬　軍縮方案</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十九日電〕美國官方現正草擬一種軍縮建議，相信此項建議可使世界步人解除軍備之途徑，並可確保美國之安全。預料該建議將於本週末或下週初正式向聯大會提出。權威方面謂，該草案將要求下列各點，作爲國參加之代價：（一）有效保證無一國家　壞業　業　　立之軍縮公的。（二）保證其他國家與美國同樣實行軍縮，並完全履行諾言。此項計劃爲美國對莫洛托夫在聯合國機構中所提軍縮建議之答復。該計劃在公佈以前，先行呈請杜魯門總統批准。</p>
<h3>聯合國控制　麻醉品工作</h3>
<p>草的經大會通過</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十九日專電〕聯大會本日舉行會議時，中美英荷及阿比西尼亞各國，均促大會迅速處理將國聯制止麻醉品工作，移交聯合國事之草約，大會當一致通過該草的。郭泰祺講演稱，中國一向擁護國際控制麻醉品工作，中國代表團對成立毒品委會一項工作，至爲積極。郭氏稱，中國政府當儘速簽署該項草的。又大會本日曾一致通過該草的，但須俟卅五個以上之國家簽字後，草的方始生效。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社布加勒斯特十九日電〕官方今晚宣布：國會選舉在寗靜與秩序中進行，僅有反對然煽動之少數流血事件，但並無結果。投票在京城各中心區，允其是各大工廠中進行。羅國軍官與土兵則在營房中投票。</p>
<p>〔聯合社布加勒斯特十九日電〕羅馬尼亞今日選舉新國會，選舉結果在明日正午以前，不致揭曉，軍隊奉命在各處投票所附近警戒。此次選舉關鍵，乃在格羅柴所領導之共黨政府是否能蟬聯，共黨政府主張與蘇聯增進關係，並樹立共產主義社會制度。反對派則贊成保持中間階級之資本主義制度。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十九日電〕國務院宣布：羅馬尼亞業向美政府提出保證，決於今日舉行之選舉中，尊重自由與公理之民主原則。羅外長泰塔萊師占昨向美駐羅京代表巴雷提出對美方照會之答覆。泰氏重申羅政府認爲美方建議，乃企圖干涉羅國內政之意，惟同時則保證決使自由與公理之民主原則，繼續爲本屆普選之導行原則。</p>
<h3>美煤礦工潮　國內外影響重大</h3>
<p>〔聯合社畢資堡十九日電〕聯邦法院雖下令禁止烟煤礦罷工，但罷工者陸續增多，昨日已有三萬八千名罷工，今日又有四萬名罷工，兩共七萬八千名左右。煤礦停閉者有二七二所，煤斤產量因而每日减少百分之二十。鋼鐵廠燃料供給開始停頓，各該廠一部份礦穴亦在罷工之列。全國煤礦是否開始總罷工，須至廿一日分曉。礦工聯曾主席會易斯已通告政府，聲明工會合同於是日期滿，自罷工禁令發出以來，魯易斯迄未有何表示。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕陸軍部今日宣布：準備與內政部合力干涉煤礦工潮，惟截止自前爲止，尚未接得陸軍出動通知。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十九日電〕代理國務卿文克遜今日招待記者稱，即將　發之國煤礦工潮，對需要　國糧食及煤斤之各國，爲一重大之打擊，若全國四中萬烟煤煤礦工人實行罷工，則煤斤以及糧食之外運，勢必停止。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十儿日電〕內長占魯格今日預測煤礦罷工對於國民生活之各方面影響至巨，據稱，罷工後六十日內，可使百分之六十四以電力發動之公用事業。百分之六十鋼鐵廠。百分之九十焦煤廠，百分之八十六頭等鐵路公司。百分之九十水門汀廠。及百分之七十其他工廠盡行關閉</p>
<h3>日戰犯物證陣述　恐不能如期結束</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京二十日電〕今日據可靠消息：遠東法庭美檢察官，原希望於十二月初結束有關日本二十七戰犯物證之陳述，但以英國及菲律濱檢察官堅持團述日太暴行之全部證件，因恐不能如期結束，十一國檢察官最近迭次會議，對於起訴書中陰謀罪之重要性，頗爲重視。控訴各被告「策劃煽動並進行侵略戰」，俟下星期美海軍大將李却遜就襲擊珍珠港事件，提出詳細報告後，此一檢舉階段，實際上原可以結束。美檢察官認爲祗須的略提出日軍暴行之特別例證，即可於十二月第二星期完成全案之陳述。</p>
<h3>希叛軍聲勢日增　北部邊區百餘村落受其控制　希政府擬向聯大申訴</h3>

<h3>日本大學生　競作洋琴鬼</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京十九日電〕在戰後通貨膨脹的巨浪中，日本學生爲繳納學費及維持生活，尋覓職業者，日益增加。有一技之長者，不愁沒有出路。目前東京各舞塲樂隊由各大學學生組成者，竟有十七隊之多，每人月收達一萬六千元至二萬元，頗爲月薪尚不及千元之公敎人員等　水階級所羨嘉。據慶應大學音樂部學生大橋談稱：今年四月起，學生之組織樂隊者漸多，渠每日一時至四時半在白木屋舞塲，下午五時半至九時在雅園舞塲，月收多時達二萬元以上。惟將來是否完全拋棄學業，以此事爲職業，抑或繼續學業而以此事爲副業，尚難決定，認眞考慮前途殊堪憂慮云。</p>

<p>〔路透社論敦十九日電〕工黨女議員巴東夫人，今日被選爲下院本屆會議十二名主席之一，女子之任議會主席，在英國爲前所未有之事，議會在舉行常務委員會會議時，當由夫人任主席，但當議會討論預算問題時，議會即成委員會，夫人即當爲整個下院會議之主席。任主席者必須熟悉程序法，並稔知下院各議員之姓名。夫人之夫巴東先生，亦爲下院議負，兩人於開會時常同坐一處。</p>
<h3>英人心目中的中國</h3>
<p>— 本報駐英記者朱尊諸寄</p>
<p>從中國來的消息固然不利，然而英國輿論界對中國的論調並不算壞。倫敦泰晤士報每天都刊有中國消息，每隔一二月，發表關於中國問題的社評一篇；每年雙十節，泰晤士報都著論分析中國時局。泰晤士報立論公正，對中共的非法妄行時有指摘。其他的倫敦報紙很少刊載中國新聞，偶爾登一兩則，十九都是小報或晚報作風。譬如中國人吃什麼，穿什麼之類，小姐們穿旗袍之類的照片，便常出現於各報閒話　或點滴欄內。新聞紀事報從前因爲蓋爾德的關係，曾經登過不少關於中國的文章，蓋爾德替中共吹噓，但他本人並非同情中共，實際上是因爲他在重慶時，和幾位發言人閙遇意見，因之竟對整個中國政府發生反感，反感至極時，竟大爲中共帮腔。紀事報現在對中國的看法已漸爲改正，他們的政論家巴特萊氏即將訪華，巴氏的世界政治眼光一向爲英國人所推崇，他對九一八事變的看法和中國的觀點完全一致。一向被國人認爲同情中國的曼撤斯特導報所刋登的中國消息很少，偶而有一篇社評，其論調也不見「同情」。</p>
<p>英國雜誌對華毀響兼有，週刋裏最有地位的「經濟學者」對中國常有論述，關於中國通貨膨脹，很不客氣的指出了內戰爲一切罪惡的根源。此次，左派的「新政治家與民族」週刋，對中國的論調有些近乎「新華」「解放」，其立塲盡人皆知，正如每日工人報（英共黨機關報）的言論之不爲人所重視完全一樣，中共對外宣傳最成功的一點，是他們所謂的「農民運動」，大吹其在邊區的减租和其他土地改革政策。一般英國報紙，連泰晤士報在內，都認爲中共對道個迫切的社會問題頓有辦法。</p>
<p>英國人對香港問題大體都不關心，有一部份人很願意把這塊島地交還中國，反對量力的還是那一般「老中國」。英國內的人民所最不瞭解的是：爲什麼在香港的中國人對英國人的惡感如是之深？這點懷疑非常自然，因爲在英本國的英國人不知道在殖民地。在半殖民地。以及在次殖長地的英國人的生活態度——帝國主義者的驕橫。這般帝國主義者在國外耀武揚威，目空一、切、回到國內，則態度改變，和普通富有幽默感的英國人一樣。</p>
<p>英國人對中國的瞭解不够，我國對外宣傳當局固應注意，但單靠宣傳是不够的，要一個民族認識我們，介紹文化生活是一個途徑；但當前國內大局之有待澄淸，却是第一件事。誰都知道中國歷史悠久，文化偉大，但若從這個偉大的文化背景裏所透露路出來的，盡是惡劣的消息。外國人心裏的大問號，便永遠也不會消除的。（完）</p>
<h3>英「叛黨」風潮雖告平息　政局仍未許樂觀　反對派佔全院三之一強　工黨內部實際分裂如故</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十九日電〕下院昨夜雖以三三五對零票，表決信任政府現行外交政策，但工黨議員有一百六十名朱投票，除患病及其他原因者外，至少有工黨議員一百人於表決時毫無表示。其比例之高，即使政府自稱勝利，亦不得不感困惱。參加表決之議員人數中，工黨二百三十人，保守黨一百零四人，自由黨七人。各小黨十二人。據擁議政府者稱，信任案之表決足以昭示世界，英國民意實擁護貝文外長，但批評者則謂、棄　議員人數之多，足證工黨政策實際上分裂如故，絕未因此而得補救。叛黨行動有再發生之可能。此種危機，政府未便漠視，遽謂一切風平浪息，未免過於樂觀。叛黨議員說明其　　原因，係由於不能即以此種表決解釋爲對政府普遍的不信任，例如對政府所行內政政策實全部贊同，甚至對於某某部份之外交政策，亦無一異議。因此，政府在下院獲得大多數信任，不外出於下列二種原因：（一）在內政方面，工黨似團結如故；（二）外交方面保守黨與工黨忠實份子一致擁護政府。</p>

<h3>京滬傳真電報開放　收發圖收照像不爽絲毫　報費分五萬二萬元兩種</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬間電傳眞蹟電報，業於昨日正式開放，文字圖照，傳一　均極淸晣。上海電信局之電傳眞蹟電報機，早已裝竣，試騐完成。南京方面亦於昨日試騐完成。昨日開放後由交通部俞部長拍致吳市長之眞蹟電報文曰：「上海吳市長國楨兄勳鑒，本部對交通各部門業務，正致全力以求改進，關於電訊革新方面，長途電話已採用超短波無綫電機，電報已試用打字電報機，並開辦特快電報，力求通訊能迅速準確，現又在京滬兩地試辦傳眞電報，今際開辦之始，敬電伸臆，諸惟惠察。弟俞大維，十一月二十日」。</p>
<p>吳市市長復俞部長電文曰：「南京交通部俞部長大維兄勳鑒，頃奉哿電，祇悉吾兄接長交通部以來，精思竭慮，致全力於交通事業之改進，採用新式電機，試辦傳眞電報，公私事業頃刻即達，使全國成一家，繫東西爲一處，推行各地，指日可期，引企新　，彌深燕賀，謹電奉復。弟吳國楨戍哿秘」</p>

<h3>參觀試騐</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二十日電〕京滬無綫電傳眞，經兩地電訊人員數月之努力，已告試騐成功，正式開放。記者今晨至南京電訊局收報台參觀，由該台主任雷大華親自試騐京滬電傳並加說明。先由上海拍一表格至京，綫條與字跡皆甚淸晣，南京亦有書寫之文件傳至上海，十二吋寬，八吋高之紙張，八分鐘即可傳畢。據談：目前因一部份機件尚未裝就，傳遞照片，恐不甚淸晰，惟傳遞其他眞蹟，不問其係鋼華或墨筆書寫，甚至藍圖，皆字字可認，情况若好，五號大小之鉛字亦可一一傳出，並以試騐成績出示，若干與普通印刷品無大差異</p>
<p>京滬電訊局目前所用之電傳機，係美國西聯公司一九四二年出品，運抵中國者共四部，其中兩部現在南京，兩部在上海，不久將運一部至北平。此種機器較現在渝昆所用者爲新式，可同時收發，且有自動設備，不若前者之麻煩不便。定購期極早，前因戰事關係，曾在印存放多時，最近始由重慶轉輾運京。由於一再遷播，加之每部重達三噸，運京時頗多損毀，需加修理，所以遲遲始能開放者，其故即在此。</p>

<h3>十五影劇人　高院今偵訊　昨日審查兩偽片　當塲對存意見書　當局希望被檢舉者　尊重司法應傳報到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市高等法院檢察處，定於今晨九時繼續開庭偵查附逆嫌疑影劇人。此次第二批被傳者爲李　華，陳雲裳，陳燕燕，梅熹，柳中浩，張石川，徐欣夫，周詩穆，卞　英，史廷磐，胡晋康，金龍章，張消還，鍾寳璇，伍仲山　十五人，但因一部份傳票未能送達，故屆時恐有多人不能到庭。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市淪陷期間，電影戲劇界人員，頗多留滬工作者，勝利後，檢舉附逆影劃人員問題，討論甚爲熱烈，但未見結果，迄至最近，突有某機關開列名單數十人，向高等法院檢察處提出檢舉，現正由該處分批傳詢偵查中。此舉使昔日留滬之影劃人員，惶惶不可終日·影響所及，幼萌於始之電影事來幾致陷於停頓。市黨部爲明辦是非，無枉無從，使電影從業員安心工作起見，特聯合各有關機關社團，於昨晨假座滬光大戰院放映「春江遺恨」，「葛世流芳」兩僞片，加以審查。到有市黨部方治，謝仁釗，孫東城，徐鳴亞，市政府王冠靑，中宣部羅學濂，敎育局李熙謀，彭振球，社會局陳愼修，夏景濤，電影檢查處杜桐蓀，江濱，靑年團吳華盛，軍之友社劉德銘，中電朱人義，地檢處梁賡舜，楊守年，上海市文化運動委員會張澈及各報記者共三四十人。高檢處負責偵查附逆影劇人員案之瞿鎔檢察官亦偕書記官參加。九時先演「春江遺恨」休息十分鐘，再映「萬世流芳」。待完畢已一時半。參加審查者，均獲有意見表一紙。各書對兩片意見，以不具名方式匯集後當塲封存。送往高檢處作爲偵查之參攷。</p>
<p>觀後感</p>
<p>市黨部方主委於觀後談稱：「萬世流芳」攝於「春江遺恨」之先。此爲歷史片，在當時日人武力統治之下，能說「中國人不會做亡國奴的」話，直覺了不得。大概日人對「萬世流芳」不感滿意，乃有「春江遺恨」之　。且有日人參加。該片可注意者即字幕出現時，必日人在先，國人在後。而劇悄出於造。據余所知日本攘夷運動與太平天國無聯帶關係云。市黨部書記長謝仁釗亦謂：「萬世流芳」叙述林則徐禁烟抗英之事，當時英帝國主義確係如此行爲，而各地亦確有平英團等組織。故該片應分兩點請，一就叙述歷史言，無可非　。二就際關係言，因今日與一英國爲盟國，則似相有問題。關於「春江遺恨」日人同情太平天國之結，歷史上似無此記載。日人之强調，國使國人對其發生好感而已耳。</p>
<p>方主委於參加觀片者塡註審查意見前稱：希各人本客觀立塲批評，並望被檢舉者依傳向法院報到，一切尊重司法云。</p>

<h3>煤氣輪渡小火車　最近將調整價格　趙曾珏昨在市參議會中報吿</h3>

<h3>清除全市積柩　衛生局限期明春遷移出境　逾期將分區集中火葬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕衛生局爲改善本市環境衛生，決將本市各區殯儀館寄柩所及空塲囑地等處之積柩予以澈底淸除，原定有主棺木限期年底以前遷移出境，現已寬限至明年三月底，俾事主可有充份時間。過期後存滬棺木一律以無主論，將分區集中火葬。</p>
<p>機悉全市積柩已向衛生局登記者九萬七千餘具，其餘未經登記或暴露於荒地者爲數亦有不少，估計總數在十萬具以上，其中一部份無主者大都已破爛腐朽，息氣四溢，各區區公所因此迭次請求將該項破棺遷移，現衛生局決定將全市積柩統籌辦理，採用最澈底之火葬辦法，限期實施。今後並將取締寄柩所之設立，殯儀館擱置棺木則以十日爲限，一方面則由政府舉辦運柩所，協助喪戶將棺木運離市區。</p>
<p>此項辦法決定以來，積柩事主頗多以無地無錢，遷葬爲難，呼籲當局多闢公墓，俾可安葬。但據衛生局方面表示清除積柩早具決心，決不能因少數人之困難面影響多數人之環境衛生。至於多闢公墓一節，不合於新都市計劃中提倡火葬减少公墓之原則，且公墓需地以每畝可葬棺一百具計，則十萬具需地一千畝，何况每月尚有平均約六千人之死亡，姑不論市府缺乏鉅款購地，即以土地之使用價値而論亦極不經濟。同時有主棺木與其寄存公厝而支付寄柩費，不如僅費一筆費用運至鄉區安葬而一勞永逸，故衛生局方面希望事主能遵限遷移云。</p>
<h3>存底豐厚銀根緊　美貨看跌不漲　一般相信走私之風難根絕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自進口許可制度宣布後，本市美貨市價並無波動，美貨商塲亦無顧客擁擠之現象。該業人士告記者：本市美貨存底甚多，而銀根甚緊，貨價只跌不會漲。商界人士認爲進口許可制之實施，在短期內不能使美貨市價上揚，惟如實施有成效，則在長期內將發生影響。但是否如此，關鍵仍在走私能否取締一點。大部份人士不相信走私能完全根絕，因走私者均有極大背景與實力，而走私之方式，亦極盡變化之能事。在目前新辦法管制之下，走私情形甚至可能更形猖獗。市塲在此種心理支配之下，美貨市價不致發生波動。</p>
<h3>取締地下錢舖　獎勵市民舉發</h3>
<p>社會局昨奉財政部電令，嚴行取締太市地下錢鋪，並獎勵市民舉　，原令云：「查自物價高漲，市塲利率，隨商業利潤而俱增，乃發生所謂「地下錢舖」者，非法經營銀行業務，並以高利貸放，盤剝取利，擾亂金融，助長投機，莫此爲甚，雖迭經查獲，依照本部管理銀行辦法內所定私設行莊之罰則，勒令停業，處以罰鍰，顧此類錢舖，多屬臨時組合，附設於住宅或商店之內，查獲旣已不易，縱被發覺，處　之後，仍可易地另設，照舊經營核其所爲，顯已觸犯刑章，亟應依法嚴懲，以資禁革。</p>
<p>查刑法第三十三章詐欺背信及重利罪，於第三百四十四條規定：「乘他人急迫輕舉或無經騐，貸以金錢或其他物品，而取得與原本顯不相當之重利者，處以一年以下有期徒刑，拘役，或併科一千元以下罰金」，第三百四十五條規定，「以犯前條之罪爲常業者，處五年以下有期徒刑，得併科三千元以下罰金」，地下錢舖得以猖獗，自保乘人急迫，輕率無經騐，以遂其高利貸放，非法取利之企岡，嗣後凡經查獲此項案件，關於擅設行莊情簡，仍應報部依照管理銀行辦法處罰，至觸犯刑章部份，應併將人犯證件，逕送該管法院，依法州究辦，以資懲儆。請即轉飭所屬一體嚴查此類地下錢舖，並獎勵舉發藉以制止，並應對於工商各業剴切佈告，如雷融通資金，應向合法設立之銀錢行莊，按正當手續辦理，或照章向地方金融機關（省市銀行總分行處）辦理小工業貸一款，免受非法貸款者之重利盤剝（下略）云。</p>

<h3>進口商登記須知　陳長桐向各銀行詳細解釋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入臨時管理委員會執委會秘書處處長陳長桐，於昨日下午一時，假中國銀行四樓，召集中外各指定銀行負責人談話。陳氏就修正辦法，施行細則，及已發之各種申請表格，詳爲解釋。並對各行所提出之疑問，分別解答。至四時許，始告散會。</p>
<p>該會所發之進口商申請登記須知，及申請表格四種，各指定銀行大多均於昨日上午收到。惟以印刷關係，所發份數，尚不敷應用。各行有分別照式添印者，一俟趕印就緒，即可接受申請。</p>
<p>進口商申請登記須知，共列四項：（一）進口商行，應各注意下列修正進出口貿易暫行辦法第二條：「進口商必須分別按其所經營之業務稱類，向輸入臨時管理委員會申請登記。其登記辦法，由輸入臨時管理委員會另定之。輸入許可之申請人，以業經登記之進口商爲限。（二）按前條之規定，本委員會業經公告如下：「凡有固定之營業地址之行商，在民國卅年十二月八日以前業已營業，或在上項日期以後開始營業，而現爲公認之國外出口廠商之代理人，或能提出一年內之記錄，證明其確有經營輸人貿易之能力者，均得申請登記」。（三）進口商欲按修正進出口貿易暫行辦法第二條之規定申請登記者，應自即日起，兩星期內，塡具表式AR-1「如係輸入附表（二）類貨品，同時並須塡表式AR-1（A）。呈送本委員會秘書處。（四）對於上海以外各埠之進口商其申請登記期限得酌予寬放。</p>
<p>申請表格四種</p>
<p>至申請表格四種，一·係進口商行登記申請書爲AR-1式。二·係過去輸入，按品分類情况表（祗限用於附表（二）類貨品），爲AR-1（A）式。三·係民國卅五年十一月十七日以前業已訂購貨品輸入許可申請書，專供申請附表（一）類貨品之用，爲AL-P2（I）式。該項申精書，須由輸入臨時管委會執委會秘書處處長，及輸入品管理處處長會同簽准。四·係民國卅五年十一月十七日以前業已訂購貨品輸入許可申請書，係供申請附表（一）類以外之一切貨品之用，爲AL-P2（II）式，該項申請書，須由中央銀行外匯審核處處長簽准。</p>
<p>以上各種表格，塡寫時均須一式四份，且尚係本年十一月十七日以前業已訂購貨品輸入許可之申請書。至該日以後訂購貨品輸入許可之申請書，則迄未見印發。</p>
<h3>烚赤盤頭狹窄　美鈔繼續下跌</h3>
<p>烚赤昨極形平定，盤頭殊窄，晨開二四九萬八有售，開後一度升至二五〇萬五，求供閑散，買方稍感冷落而告微挫，低價盤跌至二四入萬五光量，央行即以二四八萬五之價，配給六〇條，十時後更爲平穩，午刻在二四九萬光景掙扎，午後人心稍好，報載港市申鈔低落，隔日交割又升至二五〇萬外，結果較前收升一萬，飾金念六萬六，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆銀根尚平，息價自一角二至一角半。</p>
<p>外幣昨更爲鬆濫，買氣不易發動，美鈔暗市自四五五〇元起，再告下落，午刻退至四四二〇元至四四七〇元之間，較前收又跌百元，港票有供少求，電匯不振，結果再跌十元，港匯自九一五元退至九〇五元有供，印匯一一〇〇元有售，英匯自一四八〇〇元退至一四六〇〇元，成交僅港匯稍有成交，餘均沉寂，美匯依然呆滯。</p>
<h3>需要五萬件　配給打六折　棉紗供求問題　外埠及三公會請援便核配</h3>
<p>複製品工業配紗以來，紡管會督導下之配紗，近又有駱駝絨織造，帆布織造，及織帶三業公會，請求紡管會一律核配，據悉可望逖准，且將加入複配會同等辦理，此三業共有會員工廠三百家左右，屬於中小型者居多，需紗量尚屬有限，至染織，針織，內衣，毛巾，被毯，手工棉織，及手帕等業，辦理會員工廠配紗補申報，已編具淸册呈報，今日紡管會開會，當予以考慮，據複配會消息，十一月份之申請總額，原爲四〇·〇一三件，經紡管會決定暫按六折核配，計二萬四千件稍零，分四次配售，明日即爲第四次，數量本屬未足，加以歷次撥配之十支不合粗紗過多，而少數廠家以繳款期促，不及墊款而放棄者，複配會不及移配於缺額之戶，以致大部份缺少細紗，而結果細紗仍有少數退翠，一般廠家，用量愈感不足，其恃存紗以墊補者，其日趨匱乏，紗之供應如無補救辦法，複製工業之减工，勢所難免，複配會負責人潘士浩氏，早經勸告各同業，勿加開機器。勿急於恢復已停工之舊廠，且曾表示棉紗雖有配給，而對於加開及復工之機器，尚無辦法供應，日來各複製工業正在分批調查其會員廠家，嚴格取締浮報，據其最近呈報紡管會之統計，六個複製工業，共有會員廠家一·八八九家，各種織機六六·七二二合，共需各支棉紗四二·三一六件，合二十支標準五一·五二六件，如仍以六折計算，每月當爲三萬件有奇，而在紗廠方面，已嫌太多，而在各複製工廠方面，仍感不足，究應如何統籌調整，各有關方面咸表焦心，又內地之棉紗複製工業，日來亦紛紛請求配給，聞紡管會方面，已加以嚴密注意，據有關方面傳出消息，自配紗機構改組，紗廠之十支紗產量頗有增加，而本市複製業則殊不需此，十支紗之成本較低，利潤較厚，但以可紡二十支之設備，降而改紡十支，亦殊可惜云。</p>
<h3>南運紗布　審核告一段落</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會審核各廠商申請南運紗布數額，昨已告一段落。其中除有廿三家，因申請數額逾限，經該會去函囑爲更正外，其餘均已陸續發給准運許可證。又該會以各紗廠前曾兼營運銷商者，曾由請運銷商資格，該會決於今日起，接受申請。</p>
<h3>統債回跌</h3>
<p>公僅昨復平疲，五樓有某大戶脫手，統丙晨開一四五〇元自一五四〇元起，逐步下降，最後退至一四〇〇元以下結束，結果較前收下跌九十元，甲乙戊各降八十元，統丁則跌一百元，成交的四百餘萬元。</p>
<h3>證券業不景氣</h3>
<p>本市股票市塲自開做遞延交易以來，惟以銀根奇緊，且高利貸壓力甚重，仍陌於不景氣狀態，南京路一八〇號證交五十一號經紀人協泰號，於昨晨自動暫停業務，另有數家亦將擱淺。</p>
<h3>外幣不得結匯　央行重申前禁</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕進出口貿易辦法修正後，央行曾以六十一號通函，通知各指定經營外匯銀行，將原有規定，略予修正，並廢止第一·廿六·四二·四五及五四（除第六段）各號通函之規定。其中四十五號通函，係規定不得以外幣抵付外既，現經通函廢止，則此後外幣是否可以抵付外匯，殊爲各方所注意，茲悉央行復發出六十二號通函云：自第四五號通函取銷後，各指定銀行仍不得收受外幣，抵付未經央行事先核准之非進口用途外匯。</p>
<h3>油米雜糧　均見疲落</h3>
<p>昨南北米市到源絡續，客貨登記的一萬六千石，店銷動而不旺，南粳貨湧，回小千餘元，北粳中下亦疲三五百元，秈米以產價堅挺，仍居穩定之狀，白元回軟千元，陰元則提高殺次，麵粉廠方供應繼續，人心不振，雜牌再挫一二百元，小麥依然站平，黃豆今日來貨較增，本街零銷尚佳，高俏次呆，芝蔴貨稀穩固，生仁南洋本街均無大宗納胃，交易無幾，市面再見下降三四千元，豆餅閩方汕頭進胃不濃，回小一二百元，油市今日照常交易，豆油賣氣甚盛，回跌三四千元，生油立定。</p>
<h3>漢口帮等大量拋售　豆油竟跌進議價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食油新議價，昨日施行，惟油價賡續下跌，緣漢口帮豆油有一二千担拋出，而客商方面，亦頻有吐售，故市價反跌進新議價限度內。各檔食油，平均的較議價小一二千元。豆油爲十三萬一千元，菜油爲十二萬七千元。</p>
<p>昨日各民營廠繼續配油五百担，計大昌新一百担，大有餘一百六十担，長德六十五担，爲民十五担，以上均屬豆油；大生廿担，大德新八十担，以上係菜油；由上海食油聯配處分配予滬西區零售店一百四十二家。該項配油，定今日收款，明日送貨。</p>
<p>又本市各榨油廠，自獲得中央信託局供應大豆後，原料問題可告解法，今日油業方面謝裕祥張超等，將與中信局洽商購辦手續。</p>
<h3>市場開紗起爭執</h3>
<p>布廠進紗困難情願以紗易布</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市仍鮮成交，市塲上晨初有永安紗廠擬按公定價賣出廿支金城一百件，申新紗廠亦擬開紗一百件，限老戶頭素有交易者爲對象，旋以業中人提，出異議認爲非持平之道，羣起爭執，兩廠因此暫未開出，蓋粥少僧多，不敷分配也，塲外交易，格於常局功令，未有做開，苦煞一般客帮之急於辦貨者，大有備錢買不到貨之　。</p>
<p>布市目前日吳市長面諭布業代表，注意團格後，已呈穩定，惟以存底太少，一經客帮搜購，價即上升一般織廠更以進紗萬分困難。不願在市塲開售，每多喜以紗易布：俾使原料不致匱乏，此種物物交換辦法，實亦出諸不得已，色布亦因顏料奇緊，價格又貴，故一九〇號士林，日昨又漲起四五千元，龍頭細布現貨做九萬二千，藍鷄細布做九萬元，四君子白印嗶嘰現貨做九萬八千，士林布則爲十四萬五六千元之譜</p>
<h3>橡膠配得八千噸</h3>
<p>生橡膠，除瓊州外，國內向無生產，勝利以來，由聯合國橡膠分配委員會統制，迄未能直接輸入我國，上海市橡膠製品公會，以關係我國橡膠業生存於月前將全國每月需用量三千噸呈請經濟部轉請外交部交涉，頃晤該公會理事長洪念祖氏稱，已奉經濟部批令，准駐美大使館電開：本案經與聯合橡膠分配委員會接治，截至本年底止，中國分配額爲八千噸其中五千噸由英荷屬地及暹遲供給，三千噸由越南供給，此後我國橡膠製品工廠之原料，可無恐慌矣。</p>

<h3>求免稅　皂廠停工</h3>
<p>據本市皂燭業公會理事長梁嵩齡稱：本市製造肥皂之廠商，共有數十家，近來因利息太高，開支太大，以及交通不便銷路被阻等原因，營業大受影響，最近政府又規定肥皂出廠必須繳稅，廠方無法負担，聯合請求行政院豁免，在未獲准以前，暫行停工，但稅局仍須征收，以致未能復工</p>
<h3>美國金條來華</h3>
<p>〔聯合社溫哥華十九日電〕美國金條一批，價值估計爲美金三百萬元，今日已在運赴上海途中，據稱此係美國對華借款之一部份。加拿大輪「阿脫林湖」號今夜載該批黃金啓程駛滬，聞此項黃金係用以補足戰時傳被日本人取去之黃金云。</p>
<h3>南華綫貨運冷落</h3>

<h3>南洋市場　英美已捷足先得　國貨成本太貴運輸困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關人士告記者：目前我國與南洋各地間之貿易，甚爲不振。過去爲南洋區外貨未到，一時需要甚急，要求貨物之標準亦不高，於是我國之紗布及一部份日用品，遂有相當數量南運。但時至今日，形勢全非。英美商品已大量輸至南洋，而我國之紗布自給不足；商品成本之高，即使運至南洋，亦難打開銷路。運輸又屬困難問題，現航行南洋者，僅有爪哇輪船公司之船隻。數週前，有一南洋商人至滬辦貨，但依舊空手而返，因上海區之高物價，使其不敢落手，至於南洋貨之進口，爲數亦甚稀少，間或有一部份椰子油及橡膠運出，爲數亦不多。僑胞希望國貨甚殷，但祖國實無法滿足其熱望，展望南洋貿易，目前尚難樂觀。</p>

<p>杭州原爲特產外銷的都市，如絲，茶桐油之類，他在往年不僅因特產的外銷而贏得了浙江的豪富，而且亦在國際市塲上爭回不少的榮譽，但是戰後的特產外銷，成了極爲嚴重的問題，國外市塲，已有了代替品或是相同的成品，國內市塲，到處禍亂，又加上通貨貶値，成本過高，外貨傾銷，重利盤剝，捐稅繁重，使特產品處處遇到嚴重的陣碣。於是由勉强維持以至不能維持。由不能維持以至倒閉潰滅的商號行莊，着實有一個很可觀的數字道個倒閉之風彼及於每一個行業，其中尤以茶行爲最，在卅六天的時日中，申報閉歇的已有二十八家。其他閉歇的店號，雖一時尚無精確的統計，但就已呈請市府備案而辦理閉歇手續的營業單位，十月份就有二十四家，如布業五家，娛樂業五家，糧食業一家，電機絲織業一家，洗染業二家，綢商業一家，土紙業八家，雜貨業一家，醃臘業一家，土菸業一家，木排業一家，棉織業一家，如果以金錢數字來說明他的嚴重性，則將在二十萬萬元以上。</p>
<p>茶行倒閉原因</p>
<p>茶行倒閉的原因，據經營該業者言：是爲了政府徽收茶葉貨物稅。浙江的茶在全盛時代，原由浙省征收一種特產稅，後來省政府取銷特產捐，想復甦茶業，長近貨物稅局又征收貨物稅，茶葉正在外銷無路，十分艱窘的時候，受不起這種捐稅的征收，於是相率倒閉。另一種原因爲高利貸的剝削，茶行老闆以高利貸得的款項經營利潤不甚豐厚的茶葉，自然感着有些吃力，反之，如果將經營茶行的資金，來做高利貸，則可少操很多心事。因此，茶業界恐一時不能恢復固有的繁盛。這茶行倒閉的結果，將使茶農所產的茶葉缺少了若干條出路，茶晨又將受到格外的打擊與困苦，另一面，這將近十萬萬以上的資金，變爲游資，在社會上投機作祟。</p>
<p>另外很多商號倒閉的原因，除了爲了高利貸的嚴重剝削和鮮艷的誘惑兩種鉗形夾擊下面停歇號舖外，另種原因，是因爲社會購買力的衰微。公務人員一個月的所得，吃不飽，穿不暖，更何來餘力添辦新的東西？農村破產，工廠岌岌可危，農工同胞也極度缺乏購買的能力，而且因爲高利貸的誘惑，即使有被遺忘而留下來的剩餘購買力，也搖身變作游資，參加高利貸的營壘。因高利貸而獲得財富的人，有的想愈滾愈多，有的雖然購買一些東西，終屬少數之少數。所以在杭州市上，成天價沂見許多商舖張燈結綵，吹吹打打，掛着紅綢綴金字的大廉價旗幟，由春季廉價到夏季廉價，再到秋季冬季的一年四季大拍賣但是生意還遠不如往年平時的熱閙。這種大廉價如果仍舊沒有錢可賺，則繼之也只有倒閉之一途。這樣倒閉的號舖將愈弄愈多，社會上的游資也將愈滾愈多，生產的單位也將愈崩潰愈多了。而外國來的貨物，却源源而來，旣便宜又精巧，我們中國的產品就休想再銷到國外，更因外貨的價廉物美，國內時局的不靖，所以也休想外銷到咱們國內各地。</p>
<p>商界的新憧憬</p>
<p>有人說，要救濟目前中國的工商業，只有政府銀行大量低利放款。這個目標正是杭州各商界一致追求中的美麗憧憬，但是政府如果放款，獲得貸款後的明途又大堪疑問。例如高價收買蠶繭時，政府訂定一個相當的價格，繭商還爭着嚷不够高，而實際上收買時還不及政府訂定價格多多，這裏的原因就是因爲銀行有貸款，政府照訂定的價格貸給繭商，繭商以少數錢收繭，另外許多錢去作別種用途了。——這種用途想必又是高利貸放之類。因此我們爲了保障這批貸款確實用到工商界身上，而也確實是謀取工商復興的，只有嚴格的調查，嚴密的貸放，貸放以後，還要加以縝密的考核。有人說，如果把這些款項貸放出來，不是通貨更要膨漲，通貨更要貶値？我以爲這許多貸款只要直接貸到生產單位上，眞正使一個錢發卞一個錢的效用，則還可以復蘇一部份工商業。</p>
<p>堂皇的老口號</p>
<p>另外，我們想提出一個做了幾十年沒有成效的堂皇老口號，就是「中國人要用中國貨」，言先必須要養成國民愛用國貨的心理。記得在戰前上海虹口地方，有一個日本孩子，要買一匣自來火，他跑到一家中國店舖，店員告訴他：「中國貨自來火有的，比日本貨又便宜又好，你買舟匣去試試吧！」但這個孩子搖搖頭走了，他仍舊到日本店舖裏買一個日本自來火回去，這個故事可以警惕我們，可以喚醒我們，我們今天工商業如此脆弱，也只有這樣做，這樣做才有辦法。</p>
<p>獎勵特產出口</p>
<p>杭州是特產運銷的都市，浙江是晨業特產品的要地，如果這許多特產品一時運銷不到外國去，那麼大家都要垮台，所以政府應該大量投資，忍痛獎勵特產品出口，甚至，　點也　在所不辭。例如：現在茶　行莊因爲增加貨物稅而倒閉到二十八家之多，這就値得政府考慮的。</p>
<p>需要專家研究</p>
<p>我們不妨再延聘專家在這許多特產品上詳加研究發明其他各種日用品，像戰時的德國，能把本　製成麵包的代用品，和戰後的美國，能將可塑體（普拉斯的克Plaztic）製成襪子，皮鞋，皮包之類，這都可以說是由於研究而得來的。</p>
<p>商店行莊的倒風，已猛烈地　擊　特產運銷的杭州，這陣怪風，不知何時可息，我們只有自動地加强鞏固我們的房舍，以免這陣怪風將我們一切人物都吹到大海洋裏，被浪潮所捲沒了。</p>
<h3>兩百餘萬臺胞的再教育　公民訓練在台灣</h3>
<p>— 何敏先</p>
<p>十二日臺灣航訊</p>
<p>歷史上富有偉大意義的今年國慶日這一天，在台灣寳島上，乃是二百卅九萬四千六百八十五個男女靑年公民，先後陸續開始受「再敎育」的第一天，現已閉訓一個多月了。關於該省此次舉行這偌大規模，而具有普遍性的空前訓練工作，可算是史無先例，實屬創舉的一回事，其訓練動機，目標，及工作展開的內容與經過，據有關常局告記者，是這樣的：</p>
<p>認識本國實況</p>
<p>這次台省把這二百萬公民來個再敎育的動機，是爲着鑒於臺省過去受日本統治五十一年，在道悠久的桎梏歲月中，日本都是一貫的施行隔離政策，使本省同胞和祖國漸漸疏遠，現在本省光復已將一年，但我們誰都不能否認本省同咆對於祖國的一切，有深切認識的必要，這次舉辦最大目的，就是在於行使民權，而期健全我們的地方自治基礎，旋奉陳長官的指示，成人訓練應速舉辦，以簡單明瞭方式，告以本國史地及風土人情，，使認識本國實際情况，於是才組織這個「台灣省公民訓練委員會」，負責主持並推動一切，因本省同胞敎育水準，和守法習慣，都比內地任何一省爲高強，今後只要他們對於祖國的一切，有深切的認識，則對於國家民族，定有偉大無比的貢獻！</p>
<p>六個訓練目標</p>
<p>它的訓練目標有六：（一）加强認識中華民族，（二）深切了解我國的現狀，（三）積極闡揚三民主義的精義，（四）充分發揮忠孝仁愛信義和平諸美德，（五）全面普遍政令的宣導，（六）訓練普及的傳授。</p>
<p>三層基本組織</p>
<p>推動這種訓練工作的基本組織，分由省，縣（市）區，鄉（鎭）三層機關負責，如（一）省的方面：組織公民訓練委員會，由民政處，敎育處，宣傳委員會，及其他有關人員爲委員，來主持全省公民訓練事宜，並由民政　處長周一鶚爲主任委員；（二）縣市方面：也同樣設立委員會以縣市長爲主任委員；（三）區鄉（鎭）方面：派區長鄉鎭長爲督導員。</p>
<p>兩種訓練方式</p>
<p>至於訓練方式，按其性質，分有課堂式的訓練，即設立「公民訓練講堂」　普遢性廣泛的訓練，即「社會公民訓練」，（甲）公民訓練購堂—於每村里利用所在地學校教堂，中山掌及其他公共塲所爲堂址，（如因師資缺乏，得聯合二村里至三村里設置講堂一所，第一期每戶指定廿歲至卅歲之男女一人參加，如場所許可，師資不發生困難，得分設男女兩班，每期訓練期間，定爲用個月，每日兩　時，其時間以不妨碍他們之作業爲原則；（乙）社會公民訓練—利用各地電影院劇塲，爲實施社會公民訊練的　堂，每日於其開映前以卅分鐘時間放映幻燈並講演，或其他足以引起他們興趣方式，同時每日假廣播台作卅分鐘公民訓練課程廣播。</p>
<p>八項訓練課目</p>
<p>公民訓練講堂的課目，定爲政治的，與中國化兩大部門，前者如政令的宣傳，四權之運用，後者如史地的認識，黨養的灌輸，詳細內容有十二項：（一）國語，（二）國父遺敎，（三）總裁言論，（四）新生活運動，（五）歷史地理，（六）地方自治要義，（七）本省施政槪要，（八）時事講解，（九）法令講解，（十）體育，（十一）音樂，（十二）其他，觀上列幾項敎材內容，爲一個公民最低限度所必須認識的，假使個個都能好好地受訓，到了期滿，一定收穫很大，現此項課本，已由會編印十萬册負責分發，以應他們的需要。</p>
<p>師資就地取材</p>
<p>因爲限於經費，及徵集師資人才的不易，所以對於公民訓練講堂各科教師，均係就地取材，由各縣市該委員會聘請當地國民學校及中等學校敎師，行政及自治人員，黨國工作人員，政令宣傳人員，地方人士，以及其他訓練課目素有研究者，至於社會公民訓練廣播或講演人員，乃由省縣市公民訓練委員會，聘請富有學識及有敎學經騐者担任之，以上祖任人員，均係義務職，僅予以精神上的鼓勵，來協助公訊工作的開展。</p>
<p>考核獎懲嚴明</p>
<p>該會爲要明瞭此次各縣市推行情形，準備明年度開始第二期計劃的參考，及使此項訓練不致浪費時間，人力，與物力，而能獲得圓滿的效果，特派員分區出發全省十七縣市督　，預料經此次視導之後，必有許多珍貴意見的貢獻，並使我們更能明瞭此種訓練工作的實際眞相，至於獎懲分三方面：</p>
<p>（一）把公訓工作列爲負責主持各縣市縣市長及區公所市長，區署區長，鄉鎭長年終考成之一。</p>
<p>（二）受訓公民如有無故缺席違犯講堂規則，或其他不正當行動，按情節輕重予以警告或榜示缺席渚姓名，及處罰勞役（工役），一天至二天，（且受了前項處分後，仍得强制令其出席受訓。）倘情節重大者，得交當地警察機關依照違警罰則，從重處分，至於品性優良，遵守規則，測騐成績優良的受訓公民，亦予以傳令嘉獎。</p>
<p>（三）担任講堂之兼職敎師，如服務認眞教課努力，成績優良，予以傳令嘉獎，並記功，而列爲原服務機關年終考成之一。</p>
<p>進度循序而升</p>
<p>公民訓練課目已如上述，至其內容材料，完全以國民學校畢業程度之公民爲對象，行文舉例，力求簡明，同時各科教師，亦可隨時補充，至其進度乃循序而進，每週每一單元，試舉「國父遺敎」這一科，係列於第一周，而六天裏，是這樣的排列，第一日先講國父傳略，第二，三，四，五天，繼購三民主義中的民族，民權，民生，第五日則專講建國方略中的心理建設”第六日續講實業計劃與建國大　的政治建設，其他七周爲　栽言行，新生活運動，地方自治，而每一科也都是如上那樣平均的分配，有條不紊，使受訓者，對於每一問題都能得到整個的概念。</p>
<p>希望共同努力</p>
<p>台省此次舉辦公民訓練，其對全省同胞心理建設的關係非常重要。我們要建設三民主義的新臺灣，更必須注重他們的心理建設，不過這艱鉅的工作，是需要政府和人民雙方共同努力的。公民是國家的主人　，假使連做個公民所應有最低限度的智織與能力都缺乏，那便是大大減少了建設國家的力量，我在這裏很希望全臺灣梅一角落的　達人士，共同起來協助地方政府去完成政府這次實施公民訓練的偉大計劃，大家都抱着「以先知覺後知」「以先覺覺後覺」的精神，時時刻刻，予他們以實際上的帮助，以收輝煌的效果。</p>

<h3>新疆透視（四）</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>張治中主席苟欲收復新省土人的信心，必須克復兩種重要的困難。第一，自南京取得經濟援助，以救濟新疆的頹敗的經濟局面，尤以修築公路　進交通爲當務之念。第二，消滅普遍的共產主義宣傳。無疑地，蘇聯對於新疆的政治前途異常　切。</p>
<p>張治中將軍爲恢復新疆的繁榮的安寗起見，特聘中國最前進與工程師十位，至迪化爲張氏策劃發展迪化計劃。</p>
<p>最後張氏急切需要一隊訓練有素，而體格强壯，能耐山嶺及沙澳中惡劣氣候的兵士，以代替現時駐守新疆各要衝地點的缺乏訓練的新兵。</p>
<p>醫藥槪況</p>
<p>新疆省因缺乏醫藥，醫師和醫院，公共衛生狀况極度惡劣。省府官員表示，苟非在隆冬蒞臨以前設法救濟，誠恐發疹傷寒與霍亂兩種時疫將使土著回民遭遇兀運。實際上這兩種亞洲的流行病目前比較緩和，在新疆死亡率　長增高的疾病倒是天花，赤痢，瘧疾，梅毒和傷寒。</p>
<p>據衛生當局估計，新省嬰孩死亡率超過百分之七十，大部分由於天花及赤痢所致。</p>
<p>嚴重的發疹傷寒流行病正在迪化四周的山嶺牧畜地蔓延開來，苟非自中國東部趕運血淸和DDT等預防劑來此，疫勢恐不久將蔓延至迪化。</p>
<p>擁有十萬人口的迪化僅有醫院兩所，一所是普通醫院，有床位四百隻，一所是精神病醫院，有床位四十隻，設備都異常簡陋。新疆全省共有醫院十所，床位一千一百隻。全省人口據山國政府估計爲四百萬，據回民自稱在七百萬以上，但這廣大的人口絕少醫藥的救助</p>
<p>據衛生當局透露：自一九四三年以來，從中國東部運至新疆省的藥品祗有三噸。據稱聯總在兩年前曾有藥品撥給新疆省，但因缺乏運輸工具，此項藥品現仍滯留於昆明，重慶及南京等地。</p>
<p>新疆亟吩聯總與行總趕運血淸，硫磺製劑及DDT預防劑等藥品，以搶救該處的危急的公共衛生情况。一架飛機便可載運充分的藥品，以挽救危局。這給予聯總及行總一個機會，以證明它的濟世工作的崇高的價値。</p>
<p>由於回民叛變成功所造成的政治局面，聯總或行總的藥品最好直接運交回民領袖，而無美國或中國官員伴送，否則回民將拒絕接受。</p>
<p>瑪那斯河是把中國和叛黨控制的新區西北分隔開來的軍事上的邊界，這裏象徵着中國所担負的政治和經濟建設的艱鉅任務。瑪那斯河上的「大西橋」在今年六月被洪水冲毀以前，原是接連沙漠與山嶺區的內地和肥沃的西北邊陲的新省唯一的公路橋樑，現在祗留着空洞的兩座三和土橋臺，對峙在瑪那斯河的兩岸。　據政府發言人告訴記者，當局此刻還沒有準備重建該橋，此橋苟付諸闕如，欲想恢復迪化國民政府與伊寗叛黨政府間的友好關係，殊屬難以想像。迪化和伊寗間的電報和電話綫，自從一九四四年九月十九日至一九四六年一月十九日回民叛變以來，一直斷絕到現在還沒有接通。</p>
<p>當今夏低潮時期，載　蘇聯布疋，糖菓和香烟等物的若干運貨車，還能够涉渡瑪那斯河而至迪化。可是冬天的大風暴已經來臨，預示這僅有的交通也將阻斷了。因此在明夏以前中國與伊寗間唯一的交通綫，須仰仗於蘇聯航空公司的運輸機的不定期飛行。中國力圖恢復其最大邊遠行省的土地完整，看光景連地理方面也在跟中國作對。</p>
<p>新疆省主席張治中將軍如欲收復新疆四百萬回民的信心，必須恢復新疆腹地的商業。事實上新疆可以外銷的物產，大多數生長在肥沃的西北三區，即伊犂·塔爾巴哈台及阿爾泰。</p>
<p>迪化在歷史上向爲新疆的行政要城，現正力圖維持其新疆南北駱駝隊商物物交換站的地位。現在除了化粧品，香烟，茶葉和少數布疋以外，幾乎沒有貨物從中國本土運來，因此迪化必須從伊寗叛黨那裏獲得各種供應品。但是除了茶葉，化粧品和香烟以外，迪化沒有伊寗所需要的物品。</p>
<p>迪化所急切需要伊寗出產的物品有五穀，牛肉，羊肉，獸皮，食米，水菓，汽油和黃金。但是即使瑪那斯河大橋重建以後可以運輸這一切商品，迪化終不能和哈薩克斯坦競爭，因爲後者有良好的公路，　富的消費物品和機器，爲西北區回民所需要而中國當局所不能供給的。新疆全省所急切需要的是紡織廠，把土產棉花和羊毛織成布疋。</p>
<p>盛世才於一九四二年排斥蘇聯工業時，曾以美金四百二十萬元向蘇聯購買一所現代式飛機製造廠，以便改變成紡織廠。盛氏復以美金五十萬元向上海某公司購買美國紗廠機器，但此項機器至今還沒有交貨。結果新省的數百萬土民和數千中國士兵寒表無着，準備再忍受一個酷寒的隆冬。附近蘇聯境內有着過剩的布疋，但爲了下列兩種原因無法得到：</p>
<p>第一，伊寗政府恐將反對</p>
<p>該項布疋運往迪化。</p>
<p>第二，自盛世才將新證西</p>
<p>邊的門戶關閉以來，蘇聯還</p>
<p>沒有和新省訂立過任何商約。</p>
<p>除非在一個月以內從　國本土經越二千哩的沙漠路程趕運布疋來此，則數百萬新省土民和數千中國軍隊將有凍餒之虞</p>
<p>國防公路</p>
<p>中國鑒於保衛其內亞細亞邊　疆的重要性，曾指撥法幣三百億元，以建築一個軍用公路網、，把廣大的新疆邊遠行省和中國內地接連起來。目前旣沒有修築被戰事蹂躪的內地各省公路的準備，此項不惜工本的計劃是値得重視的。這條新的國防公　　幹綫，從甘肅北部的蘭州穿越靑海的邊界，直達新疆省會迪化，長百一千七百理。自蘭州至都蘭一段約三百五十哩業已完成，從都蘭起須跨越崑崙山支脈，經過察丹盆地荒野的澤地，由此越過冰雪覆蓋的阿爾金山，穿入塔克拉麥根沙漠的南邊，在察克立克會合古代的隊商路徑，橫渡沙漠至庫拉，在此接速跨越天山的山路而直達迪化　此項艱鉅事業的必要性繫於下列的事實：目前新疆與中國內地唯一的速繫便是由蘭州經東邊星星峽山隘入新疆省境取道哈密的古代絲商公路。這一條中古時代的公路，在過去數月中常受土匪的襲擊，對於遊擊馬匪允多被襲的危險，這些馬匪常出入於外蒙古邊境的山嶺中。　這條蘭迪公路的主要目的在防止中國西部要塞迪化的被隔絕，它的戰略上的重要性不亞於蘇聯現將完成的新疆西邊界外的汽車公路。這條公路介於史達林那柏德與科洛格之間，通過帕米爾山中一萬三千呎以上的高原。但是不同的地方是：蘇聯採用現代的築路機，而中國則必須用人工築路，在嚴寒的冬天。　（完）</p>

<h3>翻印與翻譯</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>據外交部王部長自己于在立法院報告我們的，中美商約允許翻譯　國的出版物而禁止靜印。有人擔心甚至於連翻譯也在禁止之列，例如照一種人的解　說似使　國著作向中國當局註册或保留版權，那末這些刋物便應得到中國政府充分的保護。這一點我們希望外交當局把它說叫　　淸楚一點。</p>
<p>不過我們更覺得中美商的中連翻印的禁止也是多餘的。中國是一個科學落後的國家，中國人能讀英文書的人已經是少得可憐，甚至　於買得起中文書的人也就不可多得了。這種翻印的限制從美國的出版商看起來得不到多大的好處，因爲中國所能銷售的數量是很少。相反的，我倒覺得在中國書坊間散置一些翻版　四　還可以替原著作者發生一　　告和宣傳的作用。再從中國的西奮讀者　　起來這祗是禁止他們多讀西書。</p>
<p>老實說，假使翻印和翻譯不受巾美商約的拘束，雙方都可自由翻印和翻譯，道在中國是佔便宜的，因爲照中美出版界的現狀看起來中國所能得於美國著作方面多於美國所能得於中國著作方面的。但是我們要知道美商由於這次中美條約的簽訂所得的利益太多了。美國是一强國，即使在這一方面吃一丁點兒虧，在另方面亦很足以彌補的了，更何况這是與中西文化的交流有很大的關係呢！</p>
<p>這次的中美商的表面上看起來是平等的，而實質上是不平等的。我覺得中山先先所分別的眞平等和假平等也可以應用到這一方面來。美國　一個工商業都很發達的國家，而中國則不然。因此，假使說中美雙方可自由通航，這在表面是平等的，但實際上美國有船，而中國使無船可航。再如說，中美可以自由通商，但是美貨銷到中國來的多，而中國貨銷到美國去的很少。這不是不平等嗎？</p>
<p>旣然如此，何以在通航通商是開放的而在出版物的　印却又是禁止的呢？中國出版界方面祇覺得我們的外交當局沒有替中國的文化前途着想。</p>
<h3>讀「教師日記」</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>著者　豐子愷　出版處　萬光書店</p>
<p>豐子愷先生的一敎師日記」於三十三年六月在重慶出版，今年六月上海再版出書。內中有一小部分曾在二十八九年間後方各雜誌上發表過。七年前我得到友人從香港寄來的宇宙風，讀到一篇「敎師日記」，那是最初披露的。後來便一直沒有見過。</p>
<p>從那最初發表的一篇日記中，我窺見一個過着平靜生活的藝術家，怎樣倉卒地辭緣緣堂，率親族輾轉西行的艱苦狼狽的情形，心中深有所感。可惜以後便沒有能看到他更多的生活的記錄。現在豐氏把他的日記付刊了，我以兩個晚上的閒暇，在燈下披閱一過，正和最初看那簾日記時懷着同樣的心情，我的情緒彷彿隨着作者的情緒而起伏，我在咀嚼這位藝術家的生活。</p>
<p>在文學作品中，一般的說，傳記和日記最能感人，因爲這兩渚都是作者親歷的生活的實錄，它們能表現出一個人個性和人格的美，而兩者之中又以日記最易便人感動，傳記有時出於別人的手筆，而日記却都是自己寫的。我們如果承認小品文在表現上的自然靈活，那一定更覺得日記之可愛了。小品文的製作，不比宏論巨構，不像寫「大文章」那麼認眞嚴肅，有時只就偶然的感觸，片斷的觀察，一點不刻劃地形之　　，因此便覺情韻雋永，趣味無窮。大抵文字根與天性，由性靈傑處激發而出的和由實際體騐流露而出的一定來得逼眞而無虛飾，自然而無彫琢。照這樣說，日記更能合於自然表現的條件，晚明和淸代諸家的日記，至今還爲人傳誦，不是沒有原因的。</p>
<p>就像子愷先生的這本日記，雖只薄薄一百六十餘頁，但從這中間我們可以看到他戰時生活的縮影，了解他平時的生活能度。他的心完全浸透在藝術之中，就在再怎樣艱苦和失望情形之下，也還是懷着一顆熱烈的滿注　希望的心。子愷先生藝術　　之深，這是我們都知道的。藝術家具有超越於常人的敏感，他對於世間的一切事相，能如實地領略，觀照，而還它本來面目，一點也不被外界的種種誘力和成見所蒙蔽，因此使能縮短人我之間的距離，做到「萬物靜觀皆自得」的悠然境界。人類之所以有仇恨，有猜忌，有嫉妬，實在由於人我之間的界限沒有打破，佛家所說的「我相」「我執」，確爲鄙嗇，慳貪之源。牘了「敎師日記」我們一定能體察到一個豁朗的藝術家的胸襟是何等的崇高，可貴。</p>
<p>這本「敎師日記」顧名思義，可知所記爲敎學生涯，內中所述包括作者西行後執敎桂　飾範的全部生活，離開桂師便繼續在浙江大學任敎，日記裏也可以看到一部分。作老在桂師和浙大兩校敎書，對教學方法，完全採啓發而不重注入。他所担任的是藝術科，他不注重模仿和臨摹，而重在激發學生的創造精神，提高學生的鑑賞能力，尤其　重的是要把藝術和現實生活溝通起來。作者認爲欲達到藝術敎育的目的必須使整個的生活　透進藝術的成分，以實現「藝術生活化」「生活藝　化」。的確，藝術是不可孤立的，隔離了現實生活的藝術，便不能稱爲藝術了。作者又要我們於理智與實利的批界以外另闢一限界，則「世間萬法常新，處處皆美的批界。」這境界豈是營營於利祿，役役於物欲者所能領略？</p>
<p>看了「教師日記」，我們可以知道豐先生不只是一位藝術家，同時也是一位理想的敎育家。在他的日記中，充滿了對靑年的熱愛。敎師除了必須注意敎材和敎法以外，更需要有一顆愛心。敎師不能眞誠地愛學生，不能以熱烈的愛去滋潤學生的心靈，那一定不會得到敎育的效果的。豐先生對學生的一言一行，往往於個別談話和偶然接觸之間，　露深沈的愛，他不愧爲「人師」，用他的人格感化他的學生，那種和對待自己子女一樣的關心和照護，可說完全發自內心，而毫無矯飾，尤其在細微處可以看出。我想　　者是受李叔同（即弘一法師）和夏丐尊兩先生的影響，因爲這兩位都是豐先生的師長，他曾受過他們兩位人格的薰陶。</p>
<p>日記中寫戰時的景象最多，有壯烈事蹟的記載，有敵人暴行的揭露，有振奮人心的言詞，有內心深處的感　。雖然有時免不了憤激，免不了慨歎，但却始終沒有失望，沒有頽喪。他深信中國的抗戰必勝，因爲他看到千千萬萬的靑年在抗戰巾成畏起來，千千萬萬的黃帝子孫在抵抗侵略的戰爭的洪流中，拚出他們的血與肉與敵人搏鬥。他對抗戰的樂觀精神正和他的誨人不倦的敎學精神同樣可敬。現在抗戰勝利了，也許覺得他的話無甚意義，其實他那時如此堅持必勝的信念實在是很不容易的。特別是在每一次受挫和受損害（如桂林大轟炸）以後，他一點也不表示頽唐和失望。談到戰時生活的艱苦，他總說「因禍得福」，實在這次抗戰是給山國新生的機會。</p>
<p>在這本日記中，字裏行間又洋溢着濃烈的人情味，一望而知作者藝術素　的深厚，就是一點生活上的小事，他都能給予它以一番藝術化的觀照，身邊瑣事都成爲人生寳貴的泉源，偶然小談都能襯托出無盡的深意。一種靄然的仁者之風，是儒家和道家思想的融化，是深得藝術之三味而表現出來的。</p>
<p>和作家往還的記述也不少，日記中提得最多的是傳彬然，丙　，宋雲彬，唐現之，夏丐尊，弘一法師諸人。他的夫人力民，及子女陳寳，　瞻，　　，一吟及新生子新枚更是日記中常提及的。家庭中一門雍穆和煦的氣氛，確實滋潤了作者逃難時的枯寂心悄。家常談笑，在常人覺無甚意味者，一到子愷先生的筆下便成爲娓娓動人的記述。如果不是一個獨具慧眼的藝術家，誰會在戰時的緊張生活中，體味到生命之美，嘗到家人父子的相處的樂趣呢？</p>
<p>村婦野的談話，牧童樵子的歌聲充分地表現出農業社會的自然與樸質；而作者的生活就浸透過這　成分。同時作者又是很懂得生活哲學的眞義的，他有一股生之活力，充滿在他的思想之中，所以他所說的話，即使是很平淡的，也能予人以雋永淸新之感。</p>
<p>凡是讀過子　生「　　堂隨筆」和「緣緣堂再筆」的人，一定能了解他的生活態度。我們總覺得他的散文有一種樸質澹遠的意境，他看宇宙萬物，無一不美，他覺得批間萬物，無一不値得人玩賞，體味。在他的日記中，我們也可以看到這種生活態度。還有，他的文筆輕鬆而活潑，沒有一點雕琢的痕跡，這與其說他文字的自然，不如說他性格的率眞。最近，他有一本散文集出版，題名「率眞集」，我想子愷先生的生活之所以令人嚮往，就由於他的率眞吧。</p>
<p>因爲他的生活自然而率眞，所以他的日記含有濃厚的幽默味，亦莊亦詼，頗能引人入勝。他的文字並沒有獨特奇妙之處，然而在平淡之中，却能顯出獨特奇妙。他已經做到寓至理於平實，寓世事於諷喻，淸淡處能尋出淳美的韻味，這或許就是子愷先生的日記所以能引起大多數人的愛好的原故吧？</p>
<p>子愷先生的漫畫，獨創一格，優點在綫條明快，表現逼眞，我想他的日記也具有這種特點。</p>
<h3>中國史學通論</h3>
<p>— 曰木</p>
<p>著作者：朱希祖　出版者：獨立出版社</p>
<p>中國史學各種體系發展之大概，爲每個愛好歷史學的朋友所必知；一般靑年對歷史的發展過程，自必須明白，而對於史學的發展，却亦當留意。因爲，歷史的記載，並不一定都是可靠的，歷占以來，多半是皇家年譜的「官史」，記載自有失實之處；而瞭解了史學的發展之後，則可以辯別出孰眞孰僞。在讀歷史方面，可以得到很多的帮助。</p>
<p>這本「中國史學通論」，是作者在北京大學史學系的講義稿，經其婿羅香林的編集，得使我們得到一本簡明扼要的中國史學概論。從而可以洞悉歷古以來的中國史學之發展過程。</p>
<p>首先，作者說中國史學之起源。「史」字的本義：說文解字有云：「史記事者也，從又持中，中正也。」作者做了簡略地說明並有　文術例。之後，它又聞明：有文字而後有記載之史，書記官之史，僞托追記之史。及未有文字由古物推測之史。這些舊時代並不稱爲歷史的諸史學系別，它均述出其利弊問題，那時候的「史」，祗是出自書記官之手的不很正確的「官史」，從而日漸發展，孕育了歷史的萌芽。</p>
<p>中國史學的派別方面：作者說了六種派別——這是自春秋以來，止於今日的各派，這六稱派別如次：</p>
<p>（一）　年史：以時爲區別者，亦稱時代史。這是始於西周之後的歷史，西周之前年代不明，故沒有此稱體制。我們常見的此種歷史，綜合的如「資治通鑑」，單獨的如「春秋」等。</p>
<p>（二）國別史，是以地方區別的，亦謂地方史。是將諾國古時的歷史，萃薈以觀；古代大小國家，不可簡略。綜合的如的三國志；單獨的如華陽國志等。</p>
<p>（三）傳記：拿人來的作區別；在這些裏面，「可窺知其地方文野之度，及社會得失之林。」常見的如女傳，東方朔別傳等。</p>
<p>（四）政治史與文化史：以率作區別，政治史方面包括經濟史，法律史，軍政史，社黨史，外交史。文化史方面則有學術，宗敎，文學，藝術，農業，工業，商業，風俗等項。前者如通典·通考，唐六典等。後者如別錄，七略，宋元學案，詩評等等。</p>
<p>（五）正史：所謂正史，非爲一時一人所作，而是歷代堆積起來的一部「官史」。如廿四史。</p>
<p>（六）紀事本末：一事的本末撰史的，至宋袁樞才創造此種體制。如通鑑記事本末，三藩記事本末，西夏紀事本末等。</p>
<p>以上六種，我不過舉其要目；本書中曾詳細地分節述明。</p>
<p>附錄二篇，其一說明「太史公解」，暢述司馬遷的撰史，最好請參考翦伯贊的「史料與史學」中，「司馬遷的歷史學」一文，可更知得詳鈿。另一篇是漢十二世著紀考，自漢高祖著紀，經過　帝，高帝，文帝，景帝，武帝，昭帝，宣帝，元帝，成帝，哀帝至平帝，這十二世的著紀，作者加以述別及列表更淸析地指示出來。</p>
<p>此書所述，雖很簡潔，內容却可稱廣泛，初學歷史的靑年朋友，可以拿它做一個良好的參考資料。雖遺漏之處，仍可找出，而在此時，尚可爲一般初學者之參證。本書中也舉出了史學上的許多錯誤。</p>
<p>在今日，誰都知道歷史在社會科學中，是一門佔重要地位的學科。已爲每個靑年不容忽視了，在讀史之前，我們更須明白中國史學的諸部門，裨使在讀史時，得到許多便利之處。</p>
<p>這本書可作讀史前的一個準備，亦可作已　史之後的一個參考。</p>
<h3>魔沼</h3>
<p>— 許培基</p>
<p>在平易坦率的叙述後面，隱藏着淸雅雋逸的情趣的；這是田園小說所特有的一種風格。如果把自然界的景物來比擬宛如山泉滙流成的一條小溪，雖然是消涓的細流，但是　琮的水聲，還在曲折有緻的崖岸間，斷續地響着它未完的淸韻。在澄澈見底的河牀中，水面上緩緩起伏的波痕，分明可以看出生命的潛力，不斷地在那兒躍動。法國　治桑的「魔沼」，描寫法國農村一樁一　單質樸的故事，在看慣了雄壯懷烈的反映時代的作品以後，正　盛著的酷熱中服了一劑清涼的飲料；又象生　　　　的早秋，在略有寒意的凉風中，沐浴着晨曦的絲絲溫暖。</p>
<p>啊！故事的展開，眞像農人　使着他的耕牛，開出的一條溝一般地簡單，平直，而毫無一裝飾。這條溝，在廣闊的原野上，也許不久即爲第二條溝所掩沒，但是在作者的筆下，鮮活而熟練的叙述，却永遠地使它在人生的園地裏保持着一個深刻的印痕。</p>
<p>你看，一百年前一個鄉下老農的典型——理智的莫老爹——他　　着他的女婿，他掩飾起自已失去愛女的悲痛，毫不嫉妒地勸他年靑的女婿續絃。但年靑英俊的柔孟，性格忠實的書中的主人翁，他用他豐滿的熱情，眷念着逝去的愛妻，在他活潑的小兒女面前，他是一個體貼戀愛的爸爸。在伯雷爾農村，他的忠懇是得到全體住民的愛戴，雖然當地被小瑪麗的一舉一動所攝住的時候，他又愚昧得像一個無知的小孩一樣。但是道愚昧在某種塲合，却會促成他勇敢的剛決，當他踏進了他岳父莫老爹指點他去求婚的冉格寡婦的屋子，他立刻明察出誇誕虛浮與榮耀的不同的性質。他巧妙地退出了虛偽的圈套。小瑪麗的天眞聰明，作者不從　面描寫她的面貌，只以她的言談舉止來反映出她心靈深處的感應。她的坦白純潔和冉格寡婦虛驕的做作比較起來，其間的差別是何等遙遠，溫柔，伶俐，大自然的女兒；他感動了年將而立的柔孟，她贏得了莫老爹的　切，她又愛撫　柔孟的兒子——年未七歲的小筆爾。在她的眼中看來，她接受旁人的「愛」和她給予旁人的「愛」是沒有什麼等差的。但是在受到她「愛」的人們，却分明地感受到有着不同的份量啊！在故事的末尾，柔孟帶着近乎絕望的心情，走進紀葉特嬤嬤——小瑪麗母親——的屋子，向小瑪麗求得最後的「愛」的裁決的時候，她不覺驚喊着：「你沒有覺得我以前是愛你的嗎？」啊！讀者的心　也將被她這一聲率直的　喊所感動了。我們不難想像出，緊接着的是怎樣的一幕可羨的喜劇。</p>
<p>在故事的進程中，作者應用她嫻熟的技巧，把小筆爾嬌憨的語態，貫穿了全書的重要關節，是異常的適切有味。她又描繪了奧摩　　主的邪惡，當他凌逼着小瑪麗而柔孟給他處罰的辦法，不過把他拖下馬捺在地上；從作者仁慈的心腸，可以看出作者對於人生的看法，對於藝術的態</p>
<p>一藝術家對於他所居處的社曾的忠實的描繪，眞是痛苦的諷刺。他注神於罪惡同苦難；但是我們這些後一　的藝術家要描畫什麼呢？我們將等着　見死的期待就是今日人類的報酬，我們將祈求它來作爲邪惡的刑罰和災害的賠償麼？」</p>
<p>在喬治桑時代的歐洲，一般從琳藝術工作者，慣於揭露社會陰暗的一面，慣於把陰鬱的諷論，注人他們的作品。杜若（Albrecbt　Durct），米開朗基羅（Michaelangelo），賀拜英（Holbeih），卡羅（Callot），和歌耶（Goya），曾對他們國家的罪惡加以强烈的諷刺，他們不朽的作品乃是具有正　價値的歷史文件。我們不會拒予藝術家以探查並暴露社會傷痕的權利；但　露是藝術僅有的功用麼？</p>
<p>作者本着她眞率的心胸，吾認了這些庸俗殘忍的觀點。她以爲藝術的使命是一種情操與愛的使命，藝術家應該担負起一宗重大的富於詩意的工作——「我們寗取能够改宗的溫和柔婉的人物，而不取招致恐怖的驚心動魄的惡徒，因爲恐怖決不會矯正自私心，而只能增加它。」她肯定了他藝術的觀點之後，又發出了「生」的頌　——對於人生宇宙的看法。</p>
<p>「我們要注意生，而不是死。我們不再信賴　　的空虛……要生活豐富，我們須欣賞生活。拉撒路應離開他的糞堆那末　人就不必再以富人的死亡爲幸了。大家都應促進快樂，少數人的幸運才不致形成罪過和苦惱……我們可以不再視死爲繁榮的懲罰，或災難的藉慰……我們不再許聽任何墳墓做那些我們不願使之快樂的人們的唯一逃避所了。</p>
<p>把她這種正確的思想，去衡量今日社會上一般人所持的消極的態度，他們所遺棄着的快樂的秘鑰，是何等値得惋惜。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，我們再求掩卷瞑想書中人物的聲　笑貌，活潑是動的氣息，含有一種樶欖般淸香雋永的風味，故事的結束，　像風兩過後的晚霞一般的明快。</p>

<h3>我最近的生活和寫作情形</h3>
<p>— 魯</p>
<p>弁言</p>
<p>還是本月十七日那天下午在文藝茶話會上，爲了大家一時的興緻，我擬了這個題目，請來參加的朋友們各人隨便寫一點身邊瑣事。用意無非在使讀者對作家多一層了解，也使本刊版而多添一些趣味。</p>
<p>承蒙那天參加的朋友們不以我這種「命題作文，當塲繳卷」的辦法爲侮，大家都推開茶盏，一揮而就。當時一共收到三十八件，還有接受了題目，的期交稿的在外。</p>
<p>現在依照收到的先後次序，先將已經整理好的月十份發表。只是爲了篇幅的限制，其餘和陸續收到的，準備在下星期內刊登。還希望朋友們原諒。　——編者</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>寫茶話會</p>
<p>茶依然是苦的，而且永遠帶有苦味的，正爲這點苦，我們不能忘懷。在苦味中談話，又覺得津津然。更何况談話的對象，都是些深知苦味的同道，便不惜話之多，不辨茶之苦了。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>我最近的生活不外敎書，編輯，寫稿，這些事。每逢星期一，三，五在江灣國立復旦大學中國文學系敎「曲選」「中國小說史」和「中文系國文」。星期二下午則在市立實騐戲劇學校敎「中國戲劇史」。</p>
<p>我在北新書局任總編輯，編有「靑年界」月刊，這刊物已經有十幾年的歷史，是以大中學生爲對象的綜合刊物，戰前銷數曾達數萬份。現出至新二卷第三號。另外我在大晚報每逢星期二出「通俗文學」週刊，中央日報每逢星期四出「俗文學」週刊。在本報春秋寫稿的戴望舒，葉德均諸先生都這兩個刊物的基本撰稿人。研究中國小說戲曲幾乎成爲我的癖好。</p>
<p>因爲生活冗忙，沒有整段的時間，所以不能寫有系統的整部著作，只是替各刊物寫寫零星稿子，但每苦於應付，幾有無話可說之感。所寫的以小說戲曲考證爲多，偶爾也寫一點讀覺與觀劇的感想。各刊物都希望我寫文壞憶舊，但我已出過「文人剪影」與「文人印象」，新認識的文人雖多，均無深交；最大的遺憾是無暇細讀每一個作家的作品，因此勉強寫出來都不深刻，我以爲寫這一類的文章是最古的事。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>惟恐吃不飽飯寫不出文章。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>進珊的拉稿木領太大，我剛坐下，還沒有和他談話，便出了題目要繳卷，這是考新生的方式，眞有點吃不消，好在不拘字數，也不限文體，那麼我就「應試」一次吧。</p>
<p>我這次是從漢口來，路過上海到北平去。自從六號到今天我都是過的旅途生活，所以非常不安定。但能够會到十多年甚至二十年來沒有會過的朋友，這是一件很快樂的事！</p>
<p>至於談到寫作，非常慚愧，打算寫的「勝利旅行記」，剛開始，等到了北平把生活安定後，我準備寫完「偉火的女性」和「在烽火中」兩個長篇，此外就想多牘點書。</p>
<p>離開上海九年多了，許多老朋友今天能够會面，實在使我太高興，要談話了，文章就此打住。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>最近，我回了一次十年未回的故鄉。返申後，原想寫些感想之類的小品，送給進珊，恰値午報發刊，編者要我續寫「娃娃日記」。於是轉變計劃，才寫數段，娃娃撒嬌，不肯寫了。正巧冰瑩從漢口來，她要到北平去編「文藝與生活」月刊，向我要「文藝作品」，想就把這未完成的娃娃日記給她，可是娃娃年齡太稚，怕經不住舟車之勞。况且時令已入冬季，北平正冷得要命，更怕我的娃娃吃不消也；祗好另想別法。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>提起我的生活，實在不足道。記得在二十年，當我在學校裘的時候，讀到科學的人生觀論戰，中有吳稚暉先生的人生觀是「吃飯，生兒子，招待朋友」三項，這二十多年來的生活，也不外乎這三項；最近的生活，除了第二項不預備再擴張外，第三項是始終是一的，我每决參加文藝茶話，也無非是想多招呼朋友而已。</p>
<p>講到寫作，非常慚愧，天天爲吃飯忙，一面當律師，一面做生意，實在不常動筆，如果編者要我寫文章，當然不敢推却。</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>我最近除了每天要辦固定的例行公事之外，在公餘的時候，還擔任了兩三個刋物的特的撰述，那就是一天都忙不過來了。跳舞塲沒有我份，最多也不過看看電影。酒不喝，菸不抽，這是三十多年都如此的。除了寫作之外，讀書，看報，也是每天必有的事。</p>
<p>八</p>
<p>我現在天天忙　在商船，誠明，美專三個學校上跺，趕鐘點，擠電車，可以說是「日無暇晷」；因此寫作的工夫也就微乎其微。暑假前還天天作畫，現在每星期只能畫一兩幅，短文也可以勉强寫一兩篇；至於計劃中所擬增訂的「中國畫家人名大辭典」，所編的「中國歷代書畫大　」都無法進行，只好等到生活稍爲淸閒的時候再行究工了。</p>
<p>九</p>
<p>生活呆板，可是有詩爲證：</p>
<p>「有見必錄聞必寫，四時無假幾時休？久聚反敎疏友誼，臨歧却又賦離愁！」（其一）</p>
<p>「春花秋月等閒過，蝸角鵬搏盡網　，却恨筆錄秃已久，删詩書史奈之何！」（其二）</p>
<p>「翩若驚鴻宛若龍，浮雲世事九州同，請君入甕君莫笑，我也糢糊在畫中。」（其三）</p>
<p>十</p>
<p>在抗戰前度粉筆生涯，被陷江南，參加游擊工作，飽受風霜。勝利後第一回做公務員，或許是倖途，職務很淸閒，於是讀寫工作公然在辦公桌進行。蕭乾兄返國後主持大公文藝編務，囑爲「文藝」經常寫書評。旅居靡定，生活動盪，關於參考書籍不便多羅致，亦不易搜購，自知在寫作上不能多所例證；寫一篇書評不能把作者整個創作的過程詳加論列，這使我內心時感不安而靦　間世也。</p>
<p>十一</p>
<p>我是一個現任的小學敎師，談到小學敎育，該是何等的重要，從事敎育工作的人該將全副精神和全部的時間貢獻給我們的後一代。但現在是一個不如意事十常八九的時代，文化人自然不能忘情於文藝藝術。</p>
<p>我現在正在寫短篇小說，但這個時代往往不能隨心所欲的完成一個作品，其原因當然很多，其中最重要的要算是寫作的環境了，在整個生活不能安定的氛圍下，文藝作品的產生是爲難的。</p>
<p>十二</p>
<p>講到生活，似乎最近和過去一樣，沒有什麼變化。前一星期，回過家裏，過了一些比較閒逸的生活，欣賞了一些深秋的處山，嚐了一些八年沒有嚐過的王四酒家的「油鷄」風味。</p>
<p>最近，我的「明代四大畫家」，世界已把它排校完竣，「色彩學研究」，商務已和我訂了版稅契的。於是，又引起我寫長稿的興味，預備在年底以前，完成一本三萬字的「中國新興美術簡史」，很想以「唯物」的看法來寫，這是一個　試，不購得會不會寫　。</p>
<p>十三</p>
<p>今年上學期在東矣大學和省立蘇州工業專科學校等上課，再加上地方上的種種事情，忙得我沒有閒暇讀書。最近來上海，雖然依舊是忙，但比較地好得多了。每隔一二星期回蘇州，有時赴杭州，生活方面，加添了不少與趣。忙裏偸閒，很想讀些古典文學方面的名著。暫時不想寫作，要預備的，是想寫「中國通史」，但這不是一件隨便的事，現在還不敢說，一定好動筆咧。</p>
<p>十四</p>
<p>我最近在銀行的公餘之暇，因爲主編浦東的地方報「東報」的緣故，所以影響到窟作的時閒。但願有些時間，先將「廣西特種部族」的文稿整理後，即行寫定「盤古研究」和「洪水傳說與伏羲造人神話的探討」二書。至於「西南採風記」及「戲劇評論集」二書的規樸已經粗具，如有出版的機會，就可以即行整理而付印的。</p>
<p>十五</p>
<p>進珊先生出了題目，並且，命令一句話，『當塲交卷』！腦汁雖然枯涸，橫絞直絞的，一點，一滴，也絞不出來。可是當塲交卷的吩咐，啊！敢不遵命！</p>
<p>生活，在以前，也許是因爲光棍的獨身漢罷，往往是，有了酒，醉啊；有了錢，用呀；有了時間，玩啊；鬧，一個不亦樂乎！深夜裏漫步，暴雨中遊園，那是家常便飯。也許是戰爭的關係吧，人的性情要亂世中平靜，似乎不可能的。</p>
<p>最近，我轉變了。引用一句文人的口頭禪我改變作風了。很抱歉，倒也不是爲了有太太的緣故。（內人是河東「鼠」，郤不會作獅吼，眞是蠢驢！）然而，自問生活，是應該整飭了。要堅忍，要刻苦，那是需要決心的。</p>
<p>所以，最近我在決心，嘗試着生活的鍜鍊！</p>
<p>近來，雖然，也很想寫作，但是缺少了孩子般的傻氣，苦幹的精神，更缺少了，對自己的信任，除了偶然的翻譯之外，實在不敢執筆。實在不敢執筆。</p>
<p>十六</p>
<p>我是新聞從業員，抗戰期中，都在後方報界服務，因我在北方住久了，不　西南的生活，而且在後方的　友漸漸的快走光了，大有　羣索居之感！所以我也就於十月廿一日離開錦城，來到京滬，看看久別的朋友，二三日內就要到久別的故都，從事於新聞事業。</p>
<p>十七</p>
<p>八年來　遲於妖氛籠罩的上海，串而不作漢奸，終年惟有閉戶作畫；有時寫幾句小詩，一吐胸臆。許多友人以爲窮苦如我，一定已經餓死了；關懷我的好友，每問及我的最近生活，我只請他看看我畫室一付自撰聯，聯云：「半日讀書，半日作畫。有時　菜，有時栽花。」這是我的生活寫實，但自顧一事無成，兩　垂垂老矣，似此又覺很對不住關懷我的好友。</p>
<p>十八</p>
<p>誰都知道跑　聞是一樁最自由的工作。無枸無束任意發展，當然很有人羨慕。不過踏入了這圈內，也有很費腦筋的地方，每天追尋綫索，急理時間，不分畫夜，不論遠近，到處去鑽，到處去訪問。我每天就是在這種的情形下生活。不過我很高興，我很覺得有趣味，心情是愉快的。</p>
<p>因爲凡　偏重於新聞的消息稿，對於文藝的寫作無形中却冷淡下來。但　並不是放棄，並不是厭惡，實在的，却遺是時間的不够，所以了新聞稿之外，再寫些新聞性的特寫外，最近可以說沒有寫別的東西。</p>
<p>十九</p>
<p>我因爲參加抗戰工作，投效空軍。多年的機械式的生活，使我感到無聊，所以爲了調濟精神，而從事寫作和研究文字，最近三年寫成勝利字體一書，換了八次稿子，製成新字體的方案，保留舊漢文的特色，採納各國文字的特長。解決了拼音字的同聲字問題，和方言的問題。現在開始出版問世，以供文化界的研討指敎。</p>
<p>二十</p>
<p>進珊先生：</p>
<p>承你關懷詢問我的「生活」和「寫作」情形。實在抱歉，近日我生活是過得非常的簡單，除每天讀報看雜誌外，簡直是什麼事都沒幹，一方面是爲了店務的繁忙，沒有寗靜的心思寫稿，不！坦白的說，我還够不到資格，然而，我是一個愛好文藝者，雖然我的力量不足，但我要去學習，獻出我的一顆赤誠的心去學習，以後還希多多的指導。最好「文藝茶話會」裏，能組設一「文藝寫作指導組」那就好了。</p>
<h3>給文藝茶話會</h3>
<p>— 呂白華</p>
<p>其文蔚豈無君子於藝游更有碩人；煮雪我來一長揖，婆娑相話亦相親。</p>
<p>是上星期吧！陳承蔭約我到「文藝茶話會」去，本來，我也想順便看看孫福熙，華林。恰巧又碰到了趙景深，這總算不孤寂了。雖然文藝茶話會的盛舉我是第一次參與；據說它的成立遠在十四年前，但十四年以前，記得我常到孫福熙家裏去，那時我還年靑，接觸着這位眞具有「文」「藝」的，又是淸逸的隱居士，太使我感動了。他那大領結，長頭髮，靄然的言談，許多年來深深烙印在滄桑磨倦了的旅人心底不會消泯過。那時他辦有「藝風」雜誌，因爲一個旅人生活的播遷，在上海的時期很短，除了偶然寫一二小品發表本報當時的本埠增刋之外，別的刋物都沒有動過筆，，不久，我到了南京，生活比較安定了，可是鎭天的等因奉此，又纏得頭腦發昏。我住的是「羊皮巷」，每决望着河隄，疏柳，懷念百里奚的五羚羊皮，在這個時代，又怎樣漲得起窮文人的身價？於是一閒下就驅筆　愁了，華林編的中央日報「中央公園」可以說是我的遣愁公園。「白華」爲我紀念亡去的母親那時起的筆名，老作家宗白華却不以爲忤，他寫的是中央日報副刋版，似乎成了並行面不悖。記得有一次，華林把我的文章分開了原名筆名於同一天登出兩　來，漸漸，原名反而湮滅，許多朋友都以筆名喊我了。「藝風」的一個短篇「月」，也是那時在南京寄去的。寫作的興趣得說是濃厚了，所以我沒有參與文藝茶話會却和它的發起人結了翰墨緣。</p>
<p>十四年以後的現在，文藝茶話會還沒有在大新五層樓恢復的一段時期，我却和文藝茶話會的友人又結了綠；那是　渦去歲尾年頭的時期，我拉魏金枝合編的「文壇」月刋，因銷數的不能維持天折了，同時，郭蘭馨要我代編的某報副刋，爲了稿費關係離開，我只兼了之江法政兩處課，覺　無聊，這時，陸丹林正編「人之初」，邀我去幫他也許是聲應氣求，我們很合得來。還有陳承蔭那是許多年來我常會而的朋友一直到現在，從徐仲年一文裏才知道他倆都是文藝茶話會的中堅。文藝，我是門外漢，何况中年哀樂的我，已提不起那「倚馬」的勇氣，不過，渺漠的前情後况，使我對文藝茶話會無形產生了一點溫情，一些親切，感和孫福熙重把手之下，他說：</p>
<p>「你還是一個老樣子」、！</p>
<p>這使我苦笑，十多年了，還能够老樣子嗎？那天到的人很多，承蔭不憚煩的替我介紹，我想到了「君子豹變，其文蔚也」。。文藝的「文」該形而上以達于德業的蔚盛的。「游于藝」，更是前聖的詔示，可是，我詩中說的「碩人」，並不一定指一碩人其頎」的碩人，碩字的本義是大的意思。文藝爲什麼從茶而不從酒？這我很贊同酒要亂性，茶則可以淸心，關外在飛雪了，如果我們拿雪水煮茶，那更好見「事文類聚」：</p>
<p>「　　得黨太尉，取雪水烹茶，曰黨家有此樂否？曰，彼安識此，但能於銷金帳下，飲羊羔美酒耳」。</p>
<p>這樣，文藝茶話會的友人在「婆娑載籍之塲」而相形的總不至流於俗套吧！這在前幾天「春秋」上陳承蔭華林徐仲年所談改進的幾點已說明了。一點溫情，一些親切感我就寫上這麼一首不成樣的詩。</p>
<h3>文壇趣屑</h3>
<p>— 詹翁</p>
<p>陳石遺寓蘇時、年八十矣。平日以詩壇祭酒自居，倚老賣老。南昌邵潭秋，偶過吳門，介金松岑謁之。石遺以爲後生小子，白眼相加。潭秋大怒，就石遺詩之用典錯誤處，舉十餘條質之，石遺瞠目不能答。越日上已，南京烏龍潭有修　之集，主其事者爲曹　蘅，邵元冲諸人，而奉石遺爲盟主。潭秋乃作「詩厄篇」一文，痛底詩人互相標榜之無恥，駡得石遺體無完膚，論者皆稱潭秋快人快事，石遺遭茲巨創，始對潭秋刮目相看，不敢再賣老矣。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　99</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>所以這種「五級測騐」，竟不容易混過，最佳的成績，也得四十八個小時。那就是說，從第一到第五級測騐，你都答覆滿意，無一點不會「邏輯」之處，同時也能熬受每種測騐下的刑騐。不過其中也有經過關說，在測騐時，比較通融得多的，也是常事。像鶴見玉這次回國受測騐，事前就有大力的脚色，早已替他關說過了；囚爲鶴見是「少壯派」中，超等幹才，會裏應當羅致，所以只經過了四十八小時的各項手續，就在這天午夜完成了一切「入會式」。</p>
<p>鶴見這時經過五級測騐，成功了黑龍會員，對於探素「七封秘緘」，獲得不少便利，雖說相當興奮，體力上却十分萎頓，而且念念不忘那「七封秘緘」到手以後的揭露工作，所以想到上野公園去疏散一下，一而可以恢復一些精神，一而也可以澄淸一切思慮，以備進到下一步工作。</p>
<p>誰知剛剛走了幾步，驀然覺得有人從屋角簷下，出來尾隨。這種事情，在普通人知覺上，當然毫無感應。鶴見心中有事，更受過相當精嚴訓練，自己本身就是一個幹着這件勾當的人，當然容易察覺。並且這時已經夜午，道上行人稀少，列容易辨別這人究竟是在尾隨，或是不相干的普通行人。</p>
<p>可是鶴見一發現有人尾隨，並不大驚小怪，只在心下默記「一個」。那就是說，被他發現了一個吊綫的人。殊不知剛剛記下了一個，接着就有五個之多，從街道的左右暗陬裏，踅了出來，遙遙吊在相當距離地方，亦步亦趨。要是僅僅是黑龍會爲了完成手續，派出人來，製造一種「投名狀」，那在鶴見方面，可說一種兒戲玩意，　可毫不措　。但鶴見一身，藏　變重，甚至於三重秘密的人，豈能大意？</p>
<p>「是蘭組的鷹犬？是黑龍會的死敵，江川復興會？（這復興會中多半是從前幕府派的黨徒，在內政上與黑龍會勢不兩立。）還是其他新興的暗巾危險敵人？」因爲這時對華侵略作戰，已經醖釀成功；軍·政·財·三界，貪功貪財的傢伙們，早已樹立許多黨派，對外爭利，對內爭權，甚或權利同爭；各黨彼此傾軋，手下擁有死士，專門幹着暗殺工作。</p>
<p>若在平時，別說僅僅五六個人，鶴見不把他們放在限下，就再加上一倍，也得掂掂他們的斤兩，先開開玩笑再講。要曉得鶴見的「柔道」，快到七段，通常十來個人，很易打發，「劍道」也過了五段，並且從過當代的馳名劍師，經過特別手法，能够赤手對劍；至於槍法，除了在陸大受過射擊專技褒獎狀外，在軍人郊外「烏目」團襄，得過首獎。但他爲什麼到東京來？爲什麼投身黑龍會？豈不都是爲了要揭發　國際上幾個魔首七封秘緘的秘密嗎？</p>

<h3>血漿</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>血漿的買賣案件，成爲時髦的課題之一了，其實，和其它汽車，鋼鐵，飛機器材，軍用毛　，配給食盒等同樣都是一種商品，又有什麼兩樣呢？不過因爲它是血漿，鮮淋淋的人體裏面的東西，所以大家對它特別注意起來。</p>
<p>美國對外物資淸理會，是應該負這次事件的實任的。第一，商人是用正式手續從淸理處購買得來的，旣非偸盜，又非走私；第二，血漿是混雜在許多物品中，事前，誰也不知道，而且淸理會從未宣佈過禁止買賣；第三，所謂黑市一名詞，引用在這里是不大貼切的，行家大批買進來，加上利息，運費，消耗等，批發給各藥房，自然得提高售價，藥房公開標價出售，這是黑市嗎？售價提高，這是黑市嗎？</p>
<p>旣然自己親手賣出，怎能又說買進的人是違法，倘使違法，第一違法是賣出的人。所以千不該萬不該，還是在當初標售時缺少愼重考慮。</p>
<p>現在這批血漿被查封了，經營溢筆買賣的人，眞是啼笑皆非，他們現在表示祇要有合理的代價，儘可收　，雖然損失，也無可奈何，希望主持人能考慮這一辦法，否則，將來商人將不敢與淸理會交易了。</p>
<h3>迅速·乾脆·痛快的原始司法公演　一位外記者的報道</h3>
<p>— 瞭然</p>
<p>美國　聞記者艾若思（WilliamAyers）曾經在山東的共產黨「解放區」住過一些時日，回滬以後最近曾在本市英文大美晚發發表幾篇回憶「解放區」的文章，其中最使人感覺興　的一篇，是敘述共產黨人如何處法漢好的那篇。因爲從這篇文童裏，我們可以看出共產黨的司法機關如何組織，如何行使職權，和共產黨的司法觀念到底如何。該文起首敘述中國農村的和平　靜，突然間，該文寫道：「胡秘書說：「今天下午有群眾集會…我們要把一個人處死」事情這　　　而突然的，當地第一號漢奸要受審判了。事前沒有佈告週知，也沒有新聞紙登載消息：在共黨政權　堅　地組織　的各小組的領袖，都收到了如下的命令：今天下午在你們的小組裏選派若干人去開會。』預審是沒有的，和國際法庭審判日　兩國戰爭罪犯顯著地相反。</p>
<p>的時候胡秘書告訴我（　記者自稱）說，那漢奸可以不必受　，只要他　　悔和承認他的罪惡。在其後的二十四小時中，和我談話的共產黨員，都異口同聲地認爲只要那漢奸肯悔過，他可以不必受審。我每次聽到這句話，總要戰　，因爲這句話有宗教色彩，和共產黨的唯物　　相反。……共產黨第八路軍對付俘虜的辦法，是施以感化教育，光詆毁對方進行戰爭的不對、其次　揚共產黨，最後是　　　　：對於他個人，和平較戰爭更有價值；被感化的俘虜如果表示懺悔和決心改過，便可獲釋，否則須受審判。這一次受審判的漢奸在某，受了八路軍一年的感化敎育而不悛悔，所以要在八月卅一日那天受『審判』。在這裏『審判』一詞和國際法庭審判日德戰爭罪犯所用『審判』一詞名相似而實不同。漢奸汪某所受審判其實可算是在那一年感化敎育中己不公開地舉行過了，那一天我眼見的審判，不過是判決主文的宣示母須猜測如何判決，大家早已知這判決結果了。</p>
<p>劇情</p>
<p>大約有兩千人坐在」—上。露台上揭開布幕，合中坐　法官孫某，其右是兩個「政府」方面的法官，三個人民團體所派的法官。其左是檢察官俞某和書記官。犯人卡車駛來的時候，汰庭上一陣沉寂……我想起了　國大革命的鼓聲。卡車在台前　下，兩個警術押着犯人，犯人的雙手反銬着。…檢察官開始論告。…檢察官論告完畢…孫法官發問這：「論告公平嗎？」被告回答；「有些地方錯了，有些事情不是我幹的。」問：你要傳證人嗎？」答：「不敢麻煩法院」。於是孫法官走向集會的羣衆，詢問人民有何意見。沒有一個人開口。「依照被告所犯的罪，應該判處死刑，法　　已經商量過了，你們的意見怎樣」孫法官向空中揮舞拳頭，大醒呼喊：「殺！」於是群眾也大喊三聲：「殺！殺！殺！」孫法官由口袋裏把寫好的判決書拿出，一行一行的念下去……」念完之後，當塲將被告槍斃。（全文見十一月十四上英文大美晚報）</p>
<p>從上面的事實觀察，共產黨的司法　念是原始的，落伍的，野蠻的；和近代民主的司法觀念相去十萬八千里：依照民主政治的原則，司法權和行政權是分立的，而共產黨的司法，則純粹是行政的附屬。共產司無所謂「罪刑法定主義」，有罪並非必　，只要肯「懺悔」，即可宣告無罪；不肯懺悔，即須判處死刑。因此，全部共產司法，只要八個字就可包括；「順我者生，逆我者亡。」共產司法不過是達到政治目的之手段，其本身並無獨立性；因此，只要政治目的達到，司法手段即可不必使用，被告目然無罪開釋了。審判官有人民代表，似乎是陪審制度，然而共產黨治下的人民代表徒有其名，連開會的「羣衆」也是由上面下命令「各小組領袖」選派若干人參加的，則陪席的人民代表更是共產黨自己挑選的，可想而知。即使眞由人民選出，其任務恐怕也僅止於陪席而已，如果首席法官不喊「殺」，他們大槪也不敢先喊「殺」的，不見那些「羣衆」麼，法官詢問他們意見如何，沒有人開口，直到法官揮拳大呼「殺」！他們才跟着「殺！殺！殺！」，可見得這些陪審員是拿來　騙老百姓的，他們的意見根本不能影響判決。還有一層，司法機關代表國家行使刑　　，對於應負刑事責任者，有依法處斷之　　，不必徵求一般人的意見；而共產司法則不然，一方面判決結果早爲衆所週知，法官早已寫好判決書放在衣袋裏，一方面却假惺惺詢問羣衆應如何判決，其偽善雖可笑，而此舉動實和近代司法觀念絕不相容！</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>共產司法沒有级審制度，無所謂上訴，覆判，抗告，再審，一經判決，立即執行，判決即有不當，毫無救濟的辦法。也沒有預審，審判程序非常簡　僅有攻擊，並無防禦，被告出庭不僅身體受拘束（帶手銬），且並無　　法律的人代其辯護；因此短短數十分鐘，即可終結一案件，較之　蘭　審理德國戰爭罪犯需時一年，東京審理日本戰爭罪犯已歷半年，上海高等法院審理漢奸每案需時數月，與共黨司法相差懸殊。近代民主國家都承認刑罰以預防犯罪爲目的，刑事訴訟採實體的眞實發現主義，因此被告在未經判決以前假定其爲無罪，對於被告有利或不利的證據均應調查應該給予被告辯護的機會，和最後陳述的機會。共產黨認司法是上層建築，刑罰無非以消滅共產主義的障礙爲目的，所以一切所謂審級，辯護，偵查，預審，當然沒有了。這種司法，和近代民主國家的司法觀念相去甚遠，所以說是原始的，落伍的，和野蠻的司法觀念。</p>
<h3>從照片想起</h3>
<p>— 醉飲</p>
<p>無論怎樣兇惡的人，拍起照片的時候，總喜歡帶着三分笑容；即使不笑，也要裝出一種樣子，使人對他有好的印象。人之所以異於禽歡者，大槪就因爲多了這麼一點。</p>
<p>所以，當你在照相館櫉窗前看一看那些不同的面孔時，總覺得那些人都似「善類」，都「笑容可掬」，都威武有爲；沒有一隻面孔，讓他的猙獰本相，現於鏡頭。據說，這固然是虛僞之允，但社會秩序却全賴此以維持。</p>
<p>這些話，是不久以前有人和我談起的。當時只覺得說這話者，頗有見地。不料到了今天，我愈覺得上面這種深入淺出的說法，眞有道理！</p>
<p>你看：從德國的戈林到中國的周佛海，這些戰爭的劊子手及侵略者的帮兇，一到法庭，無不滔滔雄辯，說得天花亂墜，如果我們天眞一點，眞要覺得這個世界上都是仁義道德的大好人。戈林在自殺以前，還設法傳出了遺囑，大說「德國人民今後使命」云云，他並非至死不悟，他何嘗不知道過去是胡作胡爲，但他儘管肚里明白，嘴里却不能不「神聖」地胡道一番，企圖使人把他看作革命者；再者，像周佛海這樣的惡貫滿盈的大奸，也都不能不來一套瞎說八道的辯護。好在上海以及許多陷區的男女同胞都還健在，且都還不太健忘，不然的話，周佛海那些「簡直激動人們心弦」的侃侃之談，眞要叫我們墮入五里霧中了！</p>
<p>使我最感到興趣的是：自從第一號漢奸陳逆公博公審以來，大大小小，無一不是堂皇自白，振振有詞，他們之中，有的雖明知難逃一死，但仍不肯放坦白點，都不的而同地大放厥詞，做出「道貌岸然」的樣子。這正如：拍照時，即使是一個殺人盈野的大盜，也露出幾分和　可親的樣子。</p>
<p>這年頭，再沒有人把心暴露出來了。大家都在胡說八道的做戲！怪不得，幾年前，馬尼刺一個嬰孩，因爲心臟長在胸外，三天以後就死去了！</p>
<h3>私生活</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>從夏佩珍說起</p>
<p>十五年前，僅次於胡蝶的女影星夏佩珍，勝利後因吸毒案，被判徒刑一年。據報載，她即可釋放。這消息使我想起了這位曾演「火燒紅蓮寺」紅星的往事。</p>
<p>民國廿一年，她加入明星公司，開始那黃金時代的影星生活。當時，她的收入除去酬勞外，月薪兩百元，拍一天的戲代價是七十元，這種優厚的待遇，非一般人所能比，然而，她却因此而染上世上最惡的嗜好。她的藝術成就，至此即被摧毁殆盡。後來，她離開明星公司時，曾與公司打過筆墨官司，一時，她是婦孺皆知的新聞人物，然而，洪水猛　般的毒物，漸潮銷磨了她的靑春和生命力，而至一蹶不振，在影壇上總很少表現。這一段藝人的墮落史，在我們追記起來，也覺得無限惋惜！現實，始終是最冷酷的！從夏佩珍想起了袁美雲，這一對黑籍紅星都犯着同樣毛病。前途就斷送在「一失足」之間，現在是沒有辦法了！</p>
<p>影劇藝人，生活淸苦，令我們同情，但也正因爲日夜工作，生活方式較自由，最易使私生活走上崩潰的道路。一念之差，即致無可救藥；我不是在這裏說教傳道，但作爲一個藝人，必須能够自己管理自己，自己的束自己，不然的話，情感一旦奔放無束，則墮落，腐化，以及白殺殉情，那些Sentimental　的行爲，都足殺死個人，又殺死藝術！</p>

<h3>無辜的殺人犯　9</h3>
<p>— 許桂</p>
<p>不一會兒，他聽見下面的人大呌起來，他知道他一定差不多到　頂點了，他睜開眼睛，看見魯遜靠着牆上站着，離開他大約有十尺的距離。米恩覺得有一點量眩，但一點都不害怕，反而覺得快活起來。他：「魯遜！」</p>
<p>「我是米恩呀。」</p>
<p>「唔。」</p>
<p>「我來這裏陪伴你下來，你用不整担心，我會照顧你的。」</p>
<p>魯遜略爲動了一動，但並未轉過身來。他說：「我祗能够　　做。我知道人家一定會誤會我的。但是，管不得許多了。」</p>
<p>「我爬上來爬得好苦啊。」米恩快活地說，「你到底怎樣跑到這裏來的呀？」</p>
<p>魯遜說：「我猛擊他的頭顱，然後把她槍殺了。他的頭顱結果沒有破裂。那條棍子居然彈得飛出去了，震得我的手好痛啊。」</p>
<p>「不要緊」，米恩說，「現在樣樣事情都過去了。」</p>
<p>魯遜突然間舉起頭來，用着特殊的音調呌了一聲：「米恩！」</p>
<p>「噢，魯遜！」</p>
<p>魯遜停了許久，然後問：「你以爲這樣做會傷她的心嗎？」</p>
<p>米恩答：「天啊！她一定不會傷心的。她絕不會覺得什麼的。」</p>
<p>「你以爲一定是這樣的嗎？」魯遜怪笑了一下間道。</p>
<p>「我以爲一定是這樣的。」</p>
<p>「那是好極了。那麼，我們現在下去罷。」他立刻站起來。</p>
<p>「米恩嚷道，」停止！不要這樣做！」但是魯遜拿起手　向　自己的腦袋開火，轟然一聲，鮮血迸流，他的身軀慢慢地倚　　躺下去。</p>
<p>米恩無精打采地注視着他的屍體，還是身體靠緊梯子。下面的人一齊嚷呌起來。他閉緊眼睛，呌這：「已經妥當了，現在用不着着急了。」</p>
<p>米恩走入汽車裏的時候，警官交一封信給他，但他根本沒有閑心注意到這些，他簡直忘記了這一會事，等到回到家裏去的時候，摩一摩袋，才記起來。</p>
<p>信封上寫着送給米恩大夫的。米恩看了，覺很傷心，但這顯然不是魯遜在後來的時候寫的。他把信封撕開看看，裏面有四張一鎊和兩張十先令的鈔票。</p>
<p>他看了許久，才把它再放入信封裏，擺入袋裏，然後閉起眼睛來。他整夜未眠，當然疲倦到再不能支持了。（完）</p>
<h3>新聞人物　華僑鉅子胡文虎</h3>
<p>— 疾風</p>
<p>胡文虎到了上海。</p>
<p>此行目的，據胡氏說：是晋京向蔣主席致敬，並報告海外華僑情形，此外，並將訪謁宋院長及俞財長，對胡氏所主持下的福建經建公司今後　展，有所請示。</p>
<p>有幾張報上，說胡氏喜歡欣賞平劇及各種地方劇，並且說他曾到共舞臺去看過機關佈量戲，一家夜報上做了這樣一個標題：「胡文虎看七劍十三俠」，不啻替共舞臺做了一則義務廣告。</p>
<p>想起了萬金油</p>
<p>提起胡文虎·便會想起虎標永安堂出品的萬金油，八封丹，頭痛粉來。「虎標永安堂」便是胡氏一手經營起來的，到現在仰光，爪哇，暹羅，香港，廣州，上海，漢口，福州，天津等處都設有分行，　界各大埠也有特約經理處，行銷的盛况，確是不可多得。但是胡氏當年開始經營的時候，據傳曾由胡氏親率　　們，披了五彩老虎衣，向各行號宣傳兜售慘澹經營，卒以起家，成爲海外鉅商，着實不是容易的事。</p>
<p>胡祖籍福建永定，但出生却在緬甸的仰光。他的父親在民國紀元前五十年，就乘了大眼鷄船，（因當時帆船船頭畫兩大眼，故名。）隻身赴仰光，創設永安堂國藥號，娶妻李氏，生了文虎文豹兄弟二人。</p>
<p>胡氏實性慷爽，對一般慈善公益事業，莫不竭力資助，與「善棍」之流直不可相提並論。他在海外各地倡辦中學，供僑胞子弟求學　　築醫　，建　　老院等，爲　胞　　不淺。允足書者，爲胡氏對國事的關懷：北伐，九一八，一二八等諸役，每决都捐助巨金，及大量藥品。抗戰期間，對祖國的資助也不少。</p>
<p>到上海辦報紙</p>
<p>有人說：胡氏這次到上海來，想籌備出版星字系報紙上海版，名星滬日報，　之胡氏　　　事業的「頗感　　」此舉　　　　·胡文虎的辦報，始於民國十年，在仰光斥資五萬元，創辦緬甸晨報，民國十七年，在星加坡斥責五十萬元，創辦星洲日報，獨霸星埠報界·民二十年又在汕頭創辦星華日報。以胡氏資本的雄厚。辦報當然頗有成功的希望。</p>
<p>在屋加坡的巴絲　讓地方，胡氏曾獨資開過一個規模大的游泳塲，塲內附設籃球塲，網球塲，羽球塲等塲口掛有「僅許華人入內游泳」的牌示。這與昔日上海「狗與華人不得入內」的牌示兩相一比，正是反映成越。</p>
<p>胡氏今年已六十四歲了，但是精　健旺如昔，看來還有好幾番事業將待完成呢！</p>

<h3>The Number of Government Commissioners Set at Forty; The Executive Yuan Increases to Eighteen Ministries and Commissions; The Central Standing Committee and National Defense Council Pass Amendment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] It is reported that the draft amendment to the National Government Organization Law, passed by the Central Standing Committee on the 20th, will be published in full at an appropriate time after discussion and revision. Judging from the revisions to the National Government Organization Law, it proves that the government authorities are sincere in reorganizing the government. Furthermore, the full text of the draft Administrative Organization Law passed by the National Defense Council will be published in the coming days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The 46th meeting of the Central Standing Committee was held at 4:00 PM on the 20th in the National Government Conference Room. More than thirty members of the Central Standing Committee were present, with the President personally presiding. The resolutions on important cases are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The President submitted for deliberation the "Revised Draft of the May 5th Constitution Draft Amendment" presented by Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, Chen Bulei, and other five members of the Constitution Draft Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference, requesting a public decision. After discussion by Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Zou Lu, Shao Lizi, Yu Youren,  Zheng and other members, who spoke successively, emphasizing that the legislative process should be completed immediately, it was resolved that the draft amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process.</p>
<p>2.  The draft amendment to the National Government Organization Law was submitted by the Acting Chairman of the National Government for public decision and implementation. It was resolved to pass the amendment. It is heard that the key points of the amendment are: (1) Article 10: The National Government shall have one Chairman, to be elected by the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang; the National Government Commissioners shall be limited to forty, to be selected by the Chairman of the National Government from within and outside the Kuomintang, with the heads of the five Yuan serving as ex officio commissioners; (This is amended according to the consultation agreement). (2) Article 16: The National Government Committee shall be the highest national affairs organ of the National Government, composed of the Chairman and Commissioners of the National Government. (3) Article 17: The matters to be discussed and decided upon by the National Government Committee are as follows: A. Legislative principles, B. Policy guidelines, C. Major military and political plans, D. Financial plans and budgets, E. Appointment and dismissal of heads of ministries and commissions and ministers without portfolio, political commissioners, and matters related to the appointment of Legislative and Control Yuan members, F. Matters that cannot be resolved between Yuan, G. Matters submitted by the Chairman for deliberation, H. Suggestions submitted jointly by three or more commissioners. (The above two cases are added according to the consultation agreement) (4) Article 21, Paragraph 1: The Executive Yuan shall have political commissioners, who shall serve concurrently as ministers of various ministries and chairmen of various commissions. When necessary, five to seven political commissioners without portfolio may be appointed. The political commissioners shall be nominated by the President of the Executive Yuan and submitted to the National Government Committee for resolution, and then appointed and dismissed according to law (This item is amended according to the consultation agreement). There are also several other articles amended, namely that Legislative and Control Yuan members shall be appointed by the Chairman of the National Government after deliberation by the National Government Committee.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] After the Central Standing Committee adjourned on the afternoon of the 20th, the Supreme National Defense Council held a temporary meeting, presided over by Chairman Chiang, to discuss the "Draft Amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Law" submitted by the Chairman. The content is to change the Ministry of Communications into two ministries, the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications. The Land Administration and Health Administrations and the Water Conservancy Commission were all changed to specialized ministries, and in accordance with the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, political commissioners were established within the Executive Yuan, increasing the total to eighteen ministries and commissions. The full text was slightly revised and passed, and the meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM. The full text of the proposal is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Submission Proposal) Due to the excessive workload of the Ministry of Communications, it is proposed to establish two ministries, the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and the Ministry of Transportation. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications shall be in charge of postal and telecommunications matters, and the Ministry of Transportation shall be in charge of water, land, and air transportation matters. Furthermore, due to the importance of water conservancy, health, and land administration affairs at the beginning of national construction, it is proposed to change the Water Conservancy Commission, the Land Administration, and the Health Administration into specialized ministries in order to improve administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>The establishment of the ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan was originally contained in Article 1 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law. It is now proposed to amend the wording of that article accordingly, and to include the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference on the establishment of political commissioners in the Executive Yuan in Article 2. The Resources Commission has already been transferred, and should also be added. The remaining articles in the Executive Yuan Organization Law pertain to the internal organization of the Executive Yuan, and it seems appropriate to follow the draft amendment prepared by the Executive Yuan in December of last year. As for the remaining points related to the Executive Yuan in the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, they should be stipulated in the National Government Organization Law as a matter of practice, and there is no need to repeat them in the Executive Yuan Organization Law. After the draft amendment to the Executive Yuan Organization Law is submitted for public decision, it will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review and submitted to the Government for promulgation and implementation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] According to sources from Yenching University, Zhang Dongsun received a telegram from Chairman Chiang on the evening of the 19th, inviting him to Nanjing to discuss major plans.

During the meeting, they put the opinions of Beiping into writing and signed it. Overall, the opinions of the party members in Beiping are mostly in favor of not participating in the National Assembly. Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi originally planned to leave Beiping on the 20th, but temporarily postponed their departure due to the lack of seats on the flight to Nanjing. It is heard that they will stay for one more day on the 21st and may be able to fly back to Nanjing on the 22nd.

However, Zhang will not stay in Nanjing for long and will return to Chongqing, after which he will no longer leave Chongqing. Because he has also decided to resign as Secretary-General of the Democratic League, the reorganization of the Democratic League is inevitable. Liang also said: "If the Democratic Socialist Party members really participate in the National Assembly, it will stir up a major wave in the Democratic League."</p>

<h3>Spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense States That the Attack on Yan'an is Groundless; The Communist Side Declares That the War Has Begun</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] A spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense stated on the 20th that reports in the foreign press that the National Army was attacking Yan'an were completely groundless.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] A spokesman for the Communist Party Office stated on the evening of the 20th that, according to Peng Dehuai's announcement, the Government Army around Yan'an has reached 100,000 people, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is surrounded on the north, south, and west sides. On the southern front is the 165th Brigade and the 123rd Brigade of Hu Zongnan's forces, in the central area of Luochuan. The First Division and the 49th Division are in Jicheng and Yichuan. The Northern front was originally the 22nd Army, in Yulin and Shenmu. Finally, the 28th Brigade was airlifted from Xianyang to Yulin. On the two lines, Ma Hongkui's 82nd Division, a cavalry brigade, and three local security teams are gathered in Lingwu. The Western front began at 11:00 PM on the 17th, the Northern front began on the 16th, and the Southern front began on the 13th. Yan'an is in a state of extreme tension, preparing for war at any time. This is a war that has never occurred in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region since October 1935. This war not only exists, but has already begun. As for reports that Zhu De and Mao Zedong have left Yan'an, they are not accurate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Communist spokesman Mei Yi officially announced that the National Army has launched a pincer offensive against the Yan'an area, signaling the government's greatest attempt to eliminate the CCP. Mei said that the four brigades of Feng Hongkui's troops, with 40,000 men, launched an attack on Yan'an from Yanchi, 140 miles west of Yan'an, on the evening of the 17th, and said that Hu Zongnan's troops had a minor contact with the Communist Army on the southern border of the Yan'an area on the 13th. Zhou Enlai said at a press conference on the 16th that if the government attacks Yan'an, the CCP will withdraw from Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, and other places, and close the Military Mediation Headquarters. Local people here believe that after the outbreak of all-out civil war, the CCP will carry out underground work throughout the country, and at the same time, the "Yan'an people" will launch another "Long March" to Mongolia and the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Another Cable] Yan'an Radio broadcast on the 20th that the advance troops of the National Army have broken into the Yan'an border area by 19 miles and have had contact with the Communist Army, which is the prelude to a large-scale offensive by the National Army against the Red Capital.</p>
<h3>Ye Jianying Remains in Beiping</h3>
<p>Other Communist Party Personnel Have Withdrawn</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] Ye Jianying visited Liang Shuming on the morning of the 20th and said goodbye to Liang.

Only the small groups remaining in Taiyuan, Dongqin, and Houma in Guan Nei will gradually withdraw. The Communist side of the Changchun Military Mediation Sub-department has also decided to withdraw the personnel of the Northeast group to Harbin. It is heard that government and US personnel of the Changchun Sub-department received a notice from Wu Xiuquan, Chief of Staff of the Communist Party, on the 19th. At the same time, the government is also considering the withdrawal of government personnel from the Northeast group.</p>

<h3>In the Laishui and Yixian Areas, the Communist Army's Offensive Failed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] The Communist Army on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway concentrated 30 regiments on the evening of the 18th and launched a fierce attack on the National Army in the Mundunzi Mountain and Scorpion Mountain areas. The two sides fought fiercely until noon on the 19th. Two brigades of the Communist Army were defeated. On the night of the 19th, the Communist Army launched another fierce attack on the north and south ditches more than ten miles southwest of Laishui with three brigades, but it failed. It retreated on the morning of the 20th. A large-scale offensive is brewing in that area, and the main forces of both sides are concentrated there.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 20th] The 11th Field Brigade of the Communist Army is now fleeing from Liujiakou, 15 kilometers east of Baoding, to Gaoyang County, looting food. Its 1st Field Brigade is entrenched in the Suquan and Zhuanlu Town areas northwest of Ding County, intending to threaten the restoration of traffic south of Wangdu on the Pinghan Railway.

<h3>Communist Forces in Northern Jiangsu Expand Offensive, Invading Suqian County from Lianshui and Shuyang</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 19th] Communist Generals Chen Yi, Xu Xiangqian, Su Yu, and others convened an emergency military meeting on the 13th.</p>

More than 2,000 Communist troops arrived at Chuanjiazhuang, 30 miles northwest of Zaozhuang, on the 17th. Zhang Guangzhong, commander of the Communist Shandong Southern Military Region, led more than 3,000 troops to sneak into Aihu in Yixian County, attempting to stir up trouble.</p>
<h3>Minister Peng Answers Reporters' Questions: Seats for Communist Party and Democratic League Representatives in the National Assembly Will Be Reserved; Pacification Zone Political Affairs Conference Concludes Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 3:30 PM today in the National Assembly Party Representatives Lounge. Peng Xuepei, Shen Yi, Ye Gongchao, Mr. Baer, and two hundred Chinese and foreign journalists attended. Peng first introduced the newly appointed Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi, who reported on the preliminary administrative guidelines for Nanjing. He then answered reporters' questions, and the meeting adjourned around 5 PM. The following is a record of Minister Peng's answers:</p>
<p>Question: The spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has stated that the National Army is frequently moving in northern Shaanxi, and aircraft are flying over Yan'an from time to time. The highway north of Xi'an is also being actively repaired. Is it true that the National Army is about to attack Yan'an?</p>
<p>Answer: This kind of atmosphere may be a propaganda tactic and a precursor to action, which is related to the newly established Action Committee of the CCP. Yulin has been surrounded for weeks, and communication relies solely on the air force, so it must pass over Yan'an. As for repairing the highway, that is a nationwide undertaking, and transportation north of Xi'an cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>Question: Please tell us frankly whether the government is planning to attack Yan'an?</p>
<p>Answer: The previous answer already gave a negative response.</p>
<p>Question: It is rumored that Chairman Chiang recently convened a meeting of senior National Army generals from various regions, where he stated that the Communist forces would be eliminated in five months and communism would be eradicated from China in five years. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: This rumor may refer to the recent Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee meeting. Premier Song and Minister Bai served as the chairman and vice-chairman of the committee, respectively. Their task was to plan for the rehabilitation and relief of the pacification zones. Attendees included personnel from relevant central ministries and commissions, as well as military and political leaders from various pacification zones. It was not a meeting of all senior generals; for example, Chief of Staff Chen did not attend. The Chairman did address the meeting, but such speculation about the content of the address is not worth denying. The meeting has continued for three days and will conclude on the 21st.</p>
<p>Question: Does the government know whether Chairman Chiang exchanged documents with Zhang Junmai?</p>
<p>Answer: Exchanging letters is a normal matter. However, I can tell you that it is very likely that the China Democratic Socialist Party will attend the National Assembly. Looking back to the establishment of the first National Political Council in 1938, the members of the council, in addition to those who were non-partisan, were mainly from the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the China Youth Party, and the China Democratic Socialist Party (formerly the National Socialist Party). Later, the Democratic League was established, mainly composed of the China Youth Party and the China Democratic Socialist Party, supplemented by educational organizations and a few individuals. The current situation is similar to that of 1938. Only the Communist Party opposes participating in the National Assembly. We are very pleased that people from the education sector, non-partisan individuals, and Mongolian compatriots are attending the National Assembly to jointly create a constitution, and the participating representatives welcome them.</p>
<p>Question: Will the Minzhi Party, led by Situ Meitang, obtain seats in the National Assembly?</p>
<p>Answer: Mr. Situ has been invited to attend the National Assembly as an overseas Chinese representative.</p>
<p>Question: Since the Communist Party and the Democratic League are not participating in the National Assembly, will the government allocate their seats to other parties?</p>
<p>Answer: No. The seats for representatives of the Communist Party and the Democratic League will absolutely be reserved.</p>
<p>Question: Is the reorganization of the National Government Committee underway?</p>
<p>Answer: The work of various parties participating in the National Assembly has not yet been completed.</p>
<p>Question: There is a proposal among the National Assembly representatives to move the capital to Beiping. It is heard that after hearing the proposal, the Beijing Municipal Council held a meeting to oppose it and is preparing to march and petition. Is this true?</p>
<p>Answer: I have not heard this news. Speaker Chen Yusheng has never mentioned this matter either. (The statements by Ye Gongchao and Shen Yi are on the second page.)</p>

<h3>Sino-British Trade Treaty Under Negotiation; Our Side is Studying the Draft; Government Has Not Yet Taken Over Dalian City</h3>
<p>Ye Gongchao Answers Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Ye Gongchao, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reported on the recent situation, Sino-British commercial negotiations, and the implementation negotiations of the Sino-French Vietnam Agreement at a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists this afternoon. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Question: A Beiping telegram reports that Soviet troops have withdrawn from Dalian and that Chinese Communist troops have taken over. Have Soviet troops withdrawn, what is the situation in Dalian, and what news does the Chinese government have?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding this matter, the Chinese government has not received a report. The Soviet government informed our country on May 23 of this year that Soviet troops had completed their withdrawal from the Northeast on May 3. Since then, there should be no more Soviet troops stationed in Dalian, because the Sino-Soviet Treaty signed last August does not allow the Soviet Union to station troops in Dalian. The Dalian area is still occupied by the Communist forces. The Chinese government has not taken over Dalian, so there is no other news.</p>
<p>Question: What is the situation with Sino-British commercial negotiations?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding the Sino-British negotiation of a trade and related treaty, the British side submitted a draft to the Chinese government six months ago. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently studying the draft. Some clauses in the draft involve other relevant government departments, and all parties are studying the relevant clauses. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes to complete this study by the end of this month, but it may take slightly longer due to the wide scope involved. However, the Chinese government and the British government both hope that the treaty will be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Question: Regarding the Sino-French Vietnam negotiations, the former Yunnan Provincial Council put forward six points of opinion. What is the situation with the implementation negotiations of the Sino-French Vietnam Agreement?</p>
<p>Answer: Sino-French negotiations can be described in four key points: (1) Recovering the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is a consistent government policy. The government has always valued the opinions of all parties in foreign negotiations, and the opinions of the Yunnan Provincial Council are certainly valued by the government. (2) The issue of Haiphong Port as a free port is being negotiated with the French side, and progress has been made. Success is absolutely hopeful. (3) Compensation for wartime cross-border public and private property losses is being negotiated. Because it involves investigation, valuation, currency value determination, and other issues, it will take longer. (4) Regarding the protection of overseas Chinese, the government is paying close attention. At the same time, the government is also negotiating with both France and Vietnam. After the negotiations have achieved results, the overseas Chinese will not only be protected after implementation, but will also enjoy better treatment than before. This can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Shen Yi Reports on Nanjing's Administrative Guidelines at Press Conference, Proceeding Based on the Principle of "Keeping the Big Picture in Mind and Starting with Small Details"</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi, reported on the preliminary administrative guidelines at the Central Propaganda Department's press conference on the 20th, stating that the municipal construction will be carried out based on the principle of "keeping the big picture in mind and starting with small details." The big picture is to complete the general preparations for local autonomy and urban planning. Small details include repairing roads and waterways. The medium-sized picture is to facilitate transportation and solve housing shortages and school shortages. The very small details include cleaning up slums and remote areas, and even adding public toilets. He also said that the conditions for successful administration are the diligent efforts of municipal government officials, the sincere assistance of citizens, the understanding and support of the central government, and the guidance and supervision of public opinion. He then answered reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What is the construction goal of Nanjing, Chinese style or Western style, or a combination of Chinese and Western styles?</p>
<p>Answer: Regardless of Chinese or Western, the goal is a modern city.</p>
<p>Question: What is Mayor Shen's view on banning dancing in Nanjing?</p>
<p>Answer: This is a very minor matter in municipal administration. Since all parties are paying attention, and the Municipal Council will also discuss it, we should first listen to everyone's opinions.</p>
<p>Question: Nanjing's finances are difficult, and income and expenditure cannot be balanced. What plans does Mayor Shen have?</p>
<p>Answer: Thank you for your concern about the difficulty of Nanjing's unbalanced income and expenditure. It cannot be resolved by simply discussing taxes, but we must find a way to resolve it.</p>

<h3>Qingdao Receives Embezzlement Case; District Court Files Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 20th] Zhu Xiancai, a receiving commissioner of the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Lu-Yu-Jin District, colluded with Jia Ziyong without appraisal and bidding procedures.

<h3>Trial Begins in Case of Hong Kong Police Kicking a Hawker to Death; Evidence Against Perpetrator Conclusive; May Be Acquitted Under Protection of British Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th] The trial of Indian police officer Seth for kicking Chinese peanut hawker Wang Shuixiang to death began this afternoon. The courtroom was crowded with spectators and heavily guarded. Four Chinese were called to testify, one of whom testified that the defendant police officer kicked the deceased ten times after he fell to the ground. Dr. Halliwell of the Hong Kong Government Hospital confirmed that Wang Shuixiang's death was caused by internal bleeding and a ruptured spleen. Dr. Halliwell also stated that the bruises on Wang Shuixiang's body were undoubtedly caused by the leather boots worn by the defendant.</p>
<p>Based on the prosecutor's indictment and the testimony of witnesses, it is possible that the defendant may be acquitted or receive only a minor punishment under the protection of the British court. The prosecutor first said that he would only present the facts of the case to the court, and said that there were contradictions between the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, and it was up to the court to judge. When questioning the police officer who was responsible for examining the deceased's body, the prosecutor raised the question that the bruises on the deceased's body may have been caused by falling on a peanut basket. The deceased died because his spleen was four times its normal size and ruptured, and he could have been saved if he had been sent to the hospital earlier. The case was adjourned until the afternoon of the 20th for retrial.</p>

<h3>Taipei's Major Thief Wu Shengcai Captured While Watching a Movie; One of the "Twelve Constellations," Nicknamed "Dog;" Secret Agents Discovered Him and Surrounded Him During the Movie</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Wu Shengcai, a well-known major thief in Taipei City, was recently arrested while watching the American detective film "The Invisible Thief" at the Xinmin Theater. There are twelve famous major thieves in Taipei City, known as the "Twelve Constellations." Wu Shengcai is one of the Twelve Constellations, nicknamed "Dog." The nicknames of the other eleven are "Pig," "Ox," "Sheep," etc. They formed a gang to commit robberies, and the number of cases is countless. Wu Shengcai is especially vicious. Two months ago, he confronted the military police and injured one police officer. The two theaters here have been showing both parts of "The Invisible Thief" for days. The protagonist of the film, named "Ghost," is a terrifying and unprecedented major thief. He uses a new scientific invention, a radio wave machine, to become invisible and commit robberies, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, and no one can see or defeat him. Wu Shengcai was clearly interested in this "American Major Thief," so he sneaked into the Xinmin Theater to watch the play. Not long after entering, he was discovered by secret agents of the police station. However, when more than 20 military police rushed to surround him, he jumped out of the theater, climbed onto the roof, and fired four shots to demonstrate his resistance to arrest. Later, seeing that the military police were all around and there was no way to escape, he returned to the theater, took off his clothes, and hid under the seat. At this time, he was found. The American Major Thief in the film was ultimately electrocuted to death. He is now imprisoned and will likely die as well.</p>

<h3>New Military Service Law</h3>
<p>Analysis of Implementation Key Points by the Ministry of National Defense</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of National Defense, in view of the State Council's promulgation and implementation of the new Military Service Law, and to eliminate doubts for all executive agencies when handling military service matters, offers the following analysis: (1) For counties and cities that have completed the investigation of eligible men and women, strict implementation should be carried out in accordance with Article 19 of the Military Service Law; (2) Counties and cities that have completed the investigation of eligible men should complete conscription within the expedited period.

The above three points have been communicated by the Ministry of National Defense to all garrison areas nationwide for their information.</p>

<h3>Relocating Unemployed Military Officers at the Chongqing Chairman's Headquarters</h3>
<p>Extend the Deadline for Enrollment and Training</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] In recent days, thousands of unemployed military officers have flocked to Chongqing, requesting enrollment and training at the Chongqing branch of the Central Training Corps. The Chongqing Headquarters has therefore instructed the Central Training Corps to appropriately relax the enrollment standards and suggested to the Ministry of National Defense that the registration and enrollment of unemployed military officers be extended again until the end of this year (originally scheduled to end on June 30th) so that a small number of genuinely unemployed regular officers can be enrolled for training. Those who forge documents or impersonate officers will be dealt with according to the law. Xiao Yisu, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, convened a meeting with over three hundred unemployed military officers in Chongqing at 2:00 PM on the 19th.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Ministry of National Defense, noting that during the War of Resistance, major transportation arteries suffered extensive damage from military actions, and although active repairs were made after the victory to restore traffic, the makeshift nature of the repairs inevitably led to difficulties.

<h3>Editorial: Establishing a New National Ethos</h3>
<p>Since the Legislative Yuan temporarily suspended the deliberation of the constitutional draft amendment due to procedural issues, various parties have paid great attention to the constitutional draft issue. The drafting of the constitutional draft amendment was originally based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Whether or not this amendment will be submitted to the National Assembly is not only related to the government's credibility but also to the future of the overall situation. Therefore, this newspaper previously published an opinion on the constitutional draft issue, believing that the drafting of a Three Principles of the People constitution had no precedent to follow, and everything was an initial creation. The drafting of the May 5th Constitution took great effort and fully reflected the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, but whether the system it established, in light of the evolution of the past ten years, especially the recent few years, is the most ideal is also questionable. As for the amended constitutional draft that the government intends to submit to the National Assembly this time, while adhering to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, it still upholds the solemn stance of the Three Principles of the People and should serve as the basis for the National Assembly to formulate the constitution. As for procedural issues, as long as the Central Executive Committee makes a resolution, it can be made compliant with the regulations in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Now, the constitutional draft amendment has indeed been passed by the Central Executive Committee and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for rapid completion of the legislative process. At the same time, the amended National Government Organization Law was also passed; the Supreme National Defense Council also passed the amended Executive Yuan Organization Law; the contents of each bill all comply with the spirit of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The passage of these bills, on the one hand, can enable the Legislative Yuan to deliberate on the constitutional draft amendment in accordance with the statutory procedures, complete the deliberation in a timely manner, and submit it to the National Assembly; on the other hand, it is showing the people of the country how the government intends to abide by and implement the resolutions passed by the Political Consultative Conference. All absurd rumors will be refuted by the Central Executive Committee's resolution this time. The government values its own promises and will not easily allow them to be changed. Unless it is on the basis of its own stance, the Central Government's lack of self-opinion should really move people from all parties and factions, even those without party affiliation. The outdated concept of "believing in our ideology before becoming our citizens" may still linger in the minds of some people, but it cannot represent a political group that is fair to the world. It is those political groups that superficially advocate democracy but actually lack individual freedom and value collectivism that have such a terrible concept.</p>
<p>The amended National Government Organization Law passed by the Central Executive Committee stipulates that the Chairman of the National Government will be elected by the Central Executive Committee and establishes forty members of the National Government, including people from both within and outside the party, and expands the power of the National Government Committee. At the same time, the amended Executive Yuan Organization Law passed by the Supreme National Defense Council, in addition to changing the Ministry of Transportation to the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, establishes three new ministries: Land Administration, Water Conservancy, and Health, and also establishes Political Councilors. All of these resolutions are in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; it can be seen here that the government is determined to abide by and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Due to the passage of these amendments, the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan to accommodate people from all parties and factions, even those without party affiliation, will be accelerated. We hope that all parties can cooperate more sincerely from now on, so that the organization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan can be more substantial, so as to establish a new model of democratic unity, and the future of the nation will be brighter from now on.</p>
<h3>Neglecting the Rectification of Border Administration is Unacceptable</h3>
<p>When the domestic situation is presenting new opportunities due to the convening of the National Assembly, we must not neglect the news and intentions from the border regions. The other day, the National Assembly's Inner Mongolian representatives, all Inner Mongolian Councilors of the National Political Council, and other Mongolian and Xinjiang people gathered in Beijing, issued a declaration, demanding autonomy, and requesting the Central Government to thoroughly implement the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang's resolutions on border administration and to revitalize border administration. At the same time, according to a message from the Associated Press from Los Angeles, it is said that the Xinjiang rebels are stirring again, and the old dream of the "People's Republic of East Turkestan" has been revived. The accuracy of this report, which comes from Los Angeles across the Pacific Ocean, is questionable. In our judgment, the former report inevitably exaggerates and is not necessarily credible; but since there is such a report, it is indeed worthy of our vigilance.</p>
<p>The need for us to attach importance to our border administration does not need to be emphasized by us. Xinjiang and Mongolia are the barriers to the north and northwest of our country and should be worthy of our attention at this time. In the past eight years, some parts of Mongolia and Xinjiang were occupied and suffered the bitter taste of aggression by Japanese militarists. When the Japanese bandits surrendered, they were subjected to the rule of armed forces other than the National Army and the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, when they were celebrating the restoration of the country, they suffered another evil burden of violent rule. Therefore, we should express our utmost sympathy and comfort to our compatriots in Mongolia and Xinjiang. The central government paid attention to the border people, and after Japan surrendered last year, it sent a Mongolian Flag Comforting Mission. Due to the recent developments in the situation, the Mongolian and Xinjiang areas have inevitably suffered from unrest. According to news from foreign news agencies, one said that the Outer Mongolian troops are concentrating near the border of Chahar Province; and the other said that the Outer Mongolian Military Command is taking strict measures to prevent anyone from crossing the border from Chahar Province and entering Outer Mongolia. Although the veracity of this news is still to be confirmed, the unrest in the Mongolian border situation seems undeniable.</p>
<p>At this time, we see Mongolian people calling for autonomy. According to reports, the Mongolian compatriots' demand for autonomy is not for division, but for the government to fulfill the promises it has made to the Mongolian people time and time again. We believe that this sentence comes from the hearts of the Mongolian Flag compatriots. The Mongolian Flag compatriots face Outer Mongolia across the Gobi Desert and know more about the real situation in Outer Mongolia. They also know the violent rule of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, their psychology is inward, not division. We admire the Mongolian Flag compatriots for being able to express themselves so frankly. The Central Government has important resolutions on attention to border administration in the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. One is that under the principle of forming a unified democratic country based on the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, the Constitution must clearly stipulate the guarantee of the autonomy of the border ethnic groups; the other is that the members of the National Government and the political affairs members of the Executive Yuan after the reorganization must have the participation of the loyal cadres of the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups; the third is that the talented people of the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups must have sufficient opportunities to participate in the actual work of various ministries and commissions; the fourth is to reorganize the Mongolian and Tibetan Committee into the Border Administration Department, so that the capable cadres of the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups can participate in actual work and assume actual responsibilities; the fifth is that in the education in the areas where the border ethnic groups live, attention should be paid to the writing of their own ethnic groups, and the autonomous systems in the border areas should be reasonably regulated according to the actual situation of each place, and with regard to the Inner Mongolian part, the original Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Affairs Committee should be restored, and the powers of the alliance flag government and the provincial and county boundaries should be clearly divided. Regarding all these decisions, this newspaper once wrote an article and commented on it, believing that "the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang this time, in addition to expanding the opportunities for border compatriots to participate in the central government, focus on supporting the autonomy of border compatriots and safeguarding the inherent cultural life of border compatriots, which not only shows the central government's concern for border compatriots, but also opens up a broad avenue for their future development." What is regrettable is that after the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, the domestic situation still failed to move towards peace, resulting in the failure to implement the previous decisions; now that the situation has changed and the Mongolian compatriots have demands for autonomy, they are calling on the central government to implement the decisions. We support the central government's concern for the border people and sympathize with the plight of the Mongolian compatriots. Therefore, we hope that the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang on border administration will be gradually implemented in a timely manner, so as to comfort the hopes of the border people.</p>
<p>As for the Xinjiang part, the news from the United States is not necessarily credible, as mentioned earlier. But we cannot but say again that in order to coordinate the border people and stabilize the border, the Central Government, based on the Three Principles of the People of the revolution, signed eleven articles of the reconciliation terms of the Yining dispute in January this year, and established two supplementary articles in June this year. At the same time, it expanded the organization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, with members from all ethnic groups living in Xinjiang. It can be seen that the central government is doing its best to support border people's autonomy and is satisfying all the wishes of the border people that can be satisfied. This enlightened policy should be supported by all the border people. Therefore, how to harmonize all ethnic groups, eliminate suspicion, and achieve sincere cooperation should be the center of the joint efforts of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Because of the transmission of the aforementioned reports, we reiterate our views and hope that the people of the country will encourage each other.</p>

<h3>Shen Honglie Will Tour Eastern Zhejiang to Complete Province-Wide Performance Assessments for New Policy Reference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] Chairman Shen is scheduled to travel to Wenzhou and Taizhou via Shanghai Haidao on Tuesday, the 26th, for a month-long inspection. After returning to Hangzhou, he plans to inspect Xinchang and other counties, and in January next year, he will travel to the counties under the jurisdiction of Chu to complete the performance assessments of all counties in the province, explore the people's livelihood, and use it as a reference for new policies.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] Chairman Shen is scheduled to go to Shanghai and then to Wenzhou on the 21st. This afternoon at 3:00, he convened a meeting with the principals and academic affairs directors of middle schools in Hangzhou. Director of Education Li also attended to review middle school education in Hangzhou. He said that the recovery is coming to an end, and the responsibility for spiritual construction is heavy. Only by knowing and understanding each other can we overcome this difficult time. However, Hangzhou schools lack material conditions, young people are docile, energy is insufficient, there is education without entertainment, and group power is too poor. Although there are many famous scholars in Zhejiang Province, the general cultural level is low, feudal concepts are strong, and morality and learning have declined, forming a failure of education. Therefore, Shen loudly called for promoting moral education and revitalizing the people's hearts, which must also start from this. He also made some statements on school management affairs.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] According to reports, only more than 200,000 shi of land grain has been collected in Zhejiang Province.

The Provincial Land Grain Office is stepping up collection and plans to adjust land tax, build Changping granaries, and increase grain production from next year.</p>

However, this must be handled by the central government in conjunction with the case, so Chairman Shen said that it will not be done this year and may be discussed at length next year.</p>

As for the equipment for building the new concrete seawall, the Executive Yuan's General Office is transporting it from Shanghai, and construction can also begin within days. After the completion of this seawall, a 150-meter water barrier will be added to prevent the river from approaching the seawall base and ensure safety. As for the collapse of the Xiaoshan Nanhe River, the Bureau has also formulated a rescue plan, and plans to stop the seawall first to prevent the tide from invading inland. However, as usual, it must be repaired by the local people themselves, and the Seawall Engineering Bureau can only assist from the side.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Cloth Factories Request Yarn Allocation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou News] There are as many as 42 weaving factories of all sizes in Suzhou. The amount of cotton yarn required is quite large. However, in the past six months, due to the depletion of cotton yarn inventory, all the factories have had to purchase from the black market. The prices are high, and it is difficult to purchase, increasing the cost of military products and sluggish sales. Therefore, cloth prices are falling from time to time, and the factories are suffering huge losses, making it impossible to maintain. It is an unprecedented crisis for the Suzhou cloth factory industry. Wu Zhenshan, Chairman of the Cloth Factory Industry Association, recently heard that the weaving factory counterparts in Shanghai have obtained a universal allocation of cotton yarn. On the 18th, he first urgently telegraphed the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to consider the difficult and precarious situation of all Suzhou cloth factories, and quickly transfer the request to the Shanghai Textile Industry Management Committee, so that the Sixth District Cotton Yarn Industry Association would allocate it nearby, in accordance with the light examples of the Shanghai Changzhou and other cloth factory counterparts, in order to maintain production.</p>

<h3>崑松展開冬防　澄錫武聯防在進行中</h3>
<p>[From Our Jiangyin Correspondent] In recent days, bandit alarms have been frequent in various districts of the western countryside. The county government believes that if vigorous efforts are not made to suppress them, future troubles are to be feared. The best way to deal with this is to restore the joint defense organization of the three counties of Cheng, Xi, and Wu, and to select local people of prestige to preside over it in order to quell the banditry. It is proposed to appoint the former Ning County Magistrate Xu Bingquan as the director of the organization. The proposal has been submitted to the Capital Garrison Headquarters for approval. Furthermore, in order to prevent banditry, Commander Tang has ordered the rapid reorganization of the township and baojia organizations throughout the county, the execution of joint guarantee agreements, the establishment of road protection villages, the flexible and comprehensive deployment of communication and intelligence networks, and the strengthening of self-defense forces. This is to be implemented by the 30th of this month. Starting from December 1st, the Headquarters will send special commissioners to inspect various counties.</p>

<h3>吳江倪慰農氏　倡用新式農具</h3>
<p>[From Our Wujiang Correspondent] Ni Weinong, an agricultural expert in this county, returned to his hometown to cultivate the land after resigning from the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in the 16th year of the Republic of China. For nearly 20 years, he has spared no effort in researching and promoting the selection and cultivation of superior varieties and increasing land fertility.

<h3>公共汽車激動乘客咒詛</h3>
<p>The Nanshi district after the war has been ravaged by artillery fire, making it quite pitiful, but at present, new houses are being built in several places, and the number of shops has also increased compared to before, so the market is gradually recovering. The municipal authorities, in order to facilitate the transportation of citizens, have public bus services, which are welcomed by the general salaried employees and working class people. However, it has recently been rumored that the buses always come in convoys of four or five vehicles, and they drive away quickly without opening the doors when they arrive at the station, leaving passengers who have been waiting for a long time unable to get on the bus.</p>
<p>One day last month, the writer had just finished a meeting at the General Labor Union and felt quite tired. When I walked to Xiaobeimen, I planned to take Route 6, but after waiting for about fifteen minutes, I did not see a bus coming. Just as I was becoming impatient, I saw three to five vehicles coming at the same time. When the bus arrived at the station, the first vehicle was already full of passengers, so the door did not open and it drove away. The passengers crowded in front of the door of the second vehicle. There were fewer passengers in the car than in the previous one. The driver and ticket seller were shouting, "There are empty vehicles in the back." Before they finished speaking, the car had already started. So the general passengers flocked to the vehicles in the back. The carriages were of course much emptier than the first two, but the ticket sellers shouted "Empty in the back!" in unison, and blew the whistle. The three vehicles chased away as if they were flying. The general passengers expressed disappointment and hatred and cursed; "Damn it! I can walk myself," "Run, run," and a few who were too impatient to wait cursed and ran away. The sky was gradually getting dark, and the writer was fortunate enough to be returning home in the evening, and had nothing to do. I decided to wait a little longer, and at the same time, I took the opportunity to look at the skilled small techniques of repairing tricycles by the roadside, which was a way to pass the time. Unknowingly, I waited another ten minutes. Four vehicles drove up in a row from a distance. The first and second vehicles were full of passengers, so they drove away without stopping. The third and fourth vehicles were relatively empty. The passengers rushed to the front of the car door before the vehicles stopped, but as before, the ticket sellers pointed to the back and shouted, "There are empty vehicles coming in the back." At this time, the writer could not help but sigh secretly, and then heard the passengers cursing incessantly; "Chinese people never do things well," This sentence made people feel "so sad!" Although the writer is just a small clerk, I sincerely hope that the people after the victory will not have such contempt for state-run enterprises! Therefore, I put forward the following points for Zhao, the director of the bureau, and the responsible personnel of the vehicle affairs department to pay attention to and improve. (1) Are the vehicles connected and arriving at the station at the same time, is it so the ticket sellers can evade the ticket checkers to not have time to take care of all of them? (2) Since there are empty spaces in the carriage, why not open the door to accommodate passengers when they arrive at the station. (3) Since Laoximen is the starting point, why does the person in charge of dispatching the vehicles not allocate them at intervals and cause several vehicles to depart at the same time? (4) In Shanghai, where Chinese and foreign transportation tools compete, it is necessary to improve the courtesy of drivers and ticket sellers to passengers. If there is no proper training, there will be no difference between them and those run by foreign merchants, then the loss of passengers switching to foreign merchant vehicles every day will accumulate over time, and it cannot be said that it is not a loss to the country. (5) It is best to assign several mobile inspectors to check whether the drivers and ticket sellers are performing their duties, and to provide convenience for passengers getting on and off the vehicles. (6) Any enterprise is prone to malpractice and dereliction of duty if there is no adequate compensation for life, so the treatment of service personnel should also be reasonable. Otherwise, even if the above points can be improved, it is only a temporary solution, because work efficiency depends on work mood, and the spirit of service is embodied in the interest of service (Zhang Zhi).</p>
<p>Looking back at the sudden outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, the Japanese invaders took the opportunity to land at the Jinshanwei estuary (November 5th of that year), and almost the entire southeast was lost to the enemy. Therefore, after painful reflection, it seems that the collapse of the Jinshanwei coastal defense should be the most painful lesson. According to the Jinshanwei City was built by Qi Jiguang during the Ming Dynasty to defend against the Japanese pirates. Unexpectedly, more than 300 years later, it was broken into by the Japanese invaders in one day. Therefore, in order to alert the people to pay attention to coastal defense and train the navy, in order to commemorate the major damage suffered in this war of resistance, and in order to mourn the lives and property sacrificed due to the sudden loss of Jinshanwei, it seems that there should be some expression. Either designate a road in a large city in our country and name it Jinshanwei Road (renaming a street in Shanghai is the most appropriate), or erect a monument near the place where the Japanese invaders first landed near Jinshanwei City to serve as a warning and a memorial, both of which are of profound significance.

<p>Reply to Mr. Wang Hucheng: Regarding the letter you pointed out was delayed, the Shanghai Postal Administration replied: "It has been found that a surface mail sent from Yin County to Mr. Wang was indeed delayed. The reason is that there are currently a large number of mails received and sent by this bureau and the Yin County Bureau, and the processing is relatively slow. We have ordered the improvement and sent a letter to the Yin County Bureau to pay attention. However, the urgent mail was indeed delivered properly on the 13th of last month. Because Gongjun, who lived together, did not deliver it on the same day, it was left for one day. Mr. Wang has provided a written proof.

<h3>聯全國全體大會通過　停止宗教種族歧視</h3>
<p>Gu Weijun Elaborates on Confucius' Philosophy to Earn Applause from the Audience</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly held its first vote of 54 countries today and unanimously passed the resolution proposed by Egypt, requesting all governments to "immediately stop religious and so-called racial persecution and discrimination." The only opponent was South African Prime Minister Smuts. During the General Assembly's discussion of the resolution, he stood alone, reading the newspaper indifferently, because India was about to present evidence of racial discrimination against South Africa.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 19th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly met today to discuss the draft resolution proposed by Egypt regarding racial and religious discrimination. Egyptian representative Awad said in his first speech that the draft resolution proposed by Egypt could be seen as "a symbol of good overcoming evil." The Polish representative expressed his straightforward endorsement of it, saying that Poland had suffered greatly from racial discrimination. Soviet representative Vyshinsky also strongly supported the resolution, but said that the resolution was too abstract and could not point out practical ways to oppose exclusion. At this point, Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun rose and said that the draft resolution proposed by the Egyptian representative was in complete agreement with the United Nations Charter, and the Chinese delegation fully supported it. Although this resolution does not have any specific provisions, there are still many countries that have failed to respect the concept of human equality. Therefore, the Chinese representative expresses unlimited welcome to the Egyptian resolution. As for China, it has respected human equality since 5,000 years ago. This principle is still implemented today. There are five different ethnic groups in China: Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan, and the religions they believe in are enough to represent all the religions in the world, but they can still live in peace with each other. This is because China can implement the principle of human equality. The first teacher Confucius of China said, "All men within the four seas are brothers." We are always mindful of Confucius's legacy and earnestly follow it, and we deeply hope that the General Assembly can unanimously pass the resolution proposed by Egypt. Soviet representative Vyshinsky expressed that although the Soviet Union would vote to support the resolution, he felt that the failure of the resolution to list factual country names and to suggest specific measures to prevent discrimination was a deficiency. U.S. representative Austin and British representative Shawcross also spoke in succession to support the resolution. Shawcross also expressed his support for Vyshinsky's point of view, pointing out that words and resolutions alone were not enough, so the United Kingdom would do its best to complete the Human Rights Commission in the General Assembly to stipulate a code of fundamental human rights. The Indian representative said that this draft resolution, because it is a major step in determining the complete equality between humans regardless of whether they are white, black, or yellow, deeply hopes that this draft resolution can be unanimously passed, and hopes that the representatives of various countries can study the situation in their own countries after returning home. And find ways to remedy any existing discrimination. Finally, French representative Baroudy said that the French delegation expressed its support for this resolution, but I would like to tell everyone that France has never allowed any racial discrimination, and such discrimination is completely inconsistent with the spirit of the French people.</p>
<h3>安理會改選理事　哥敘比三國當選　社經會理事美黎重選蟬聯</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, New York, 19th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly today elected Colombia, Syria, and Belgium as non-permanent members of the Security Council for a term of two years. The "General Assembly" also elected Venezuela and New Zealand as members of the Social and Economic Council for a term of three years, and the United States and Lebanon were re-elected to consecutive terms. There were still two seats vacant in the Economic and Social Council, but because the voting results were not enough by two-thirds, none of the four candidate countries (Turkey, Netherlands, Belarus, and Yugoslavia) were elected. General Assembly President Spaak then announced that it would be decided at the next plenary session. Due to today's election results, next year's eleven Security Council members will be: the five permanent members (U.S., U.K., China, Soviet Union, France) and Australia, Brazil, and Poland (the terms of the above three countries will expire at the end of 1947) and Colombia, Syria, and Belgium elected today. Next year's Economic and Social Council members will be: Cuba, Czechoslovakia, India, Norway, Soviet Union, United Kingdom (terms expire at the end of 1947), Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, France, (terms expire at the end of 1948) and the four countries elected today (United States, Venezuela, Lebanon, and New Zealand) and the two countries that have not yet been elected, all of which have terms expiring at the end of 1949.</p>
<p>India Fails to Be Elected</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 20th Dispatch] The three elected members of the Security Council were elected by secret ballot. It is reported that India has tried its best to win a seat on the Security Council to replace Egypt and has obtained the support of China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, but India only received thirteen votes, ranking fourth and failing to be elected. The election results show that the composition of the Security Council still maintains the previous regional distribution method. Colombia represents Latin America, Syria represents the Arab group, and Belgium represents Western European countries. Colombia succeeds Mexico, Syria succeeds Egypt, and Belgium succeeds the Netherlands. Before the actual election was held, there was still a lot of behind-the-scenes activity, and the result had been predetermined long ago. The election was just a routine procedure.</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫主張　義南直接談判</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th, United Press] Molotov informed Italy that the Soviet Union advocated direct negotiations between Italy and South Tyrol to resolve the problem of the port of Trieste and the border between Italy and South Tyrol. Molotov said in a letter to Italian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Garomi (now in New York as a member of the Italian delegation attending the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference) to convey the position of the Soviet Union. Molotov said that the Soviet Union supports the proposal put forward by Sintot to hold direct negotiations, and said that the Soviet government believes that direct negotiations between Italy and South Tyrol can solve this problem in a spirit of agreement and restore normal relations between Italy and South Tyrol.</p>
<h3>沙地國利用美貸款　在波斯灣開闢商港　築三百哩鐵路與腹地聯絡</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 19th Dispatch] Radio Moscow broadcast from Mecca, the holy city of Islam, today, saying: Saudi Arabian Finance Minister Suliman announced a plan to use the credit loan recently borrowed from the United States to build a new port in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Suliman went to Washington in August of this year and negotiated with the Export-Import Bank to borrow US$10 million for the purchase of goods in the United States. The new port to be built will be connected to the inland city of Riyadh by a 300-mile-long railway, and its equipment will be purchased from the United States. It is planned to build power plants in Riyadh and Medina, which will also be equipped with American equipment.</p>
<h3>聯大決定　休會日期</h3>
<p>至遲下月十一日</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th Dispatch] The General Assembly's Steering or Guidance Committee held a meeting immediately after the General Assembly adjourned today and decided that December 11 will be the last adjournment date of the General Assembly, and December 5 will be the last date for committee meetings.</p>
<h3>安理會昨開會討論　國外駐軍問題　五強即可筣會商討否決權</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco 20th Broadcast: The Security Council met this afternoon to discuss the most difficult issue, namely the number of troops of the allied countries stationed in non-enemy countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 20th Dispatch] The five powers are expected to resume discussions today on the plan proposed by China, the the UK, and the US to limit the use of veto power. It is said that the five-power meeting was temporarily cancelled yesterday. The reason was not announced, but it is thought to be because the United Nations was holding a plenary session at the same time, and the foreign ministers could not spare the time. Bevin met with Byrnes yesterday morning, presumably to exchange views on the German issue and the Palestinian issue.</p>
<h3>British Policy on the German Question: Six Principles Decided</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] Sources here claim that the United Kingdom, United States, France, and the Soviet Union will soon hold a meeting in New York to discuss the German question. The UK's stance for advocacy at that time has been clearly defined. Foreign Secretary Bevin is said to have prepared a memorandum outlining the British arguments, essentially comprising the following six points: (1) The UK advocates that Germany should achieve political and economic unification under a system that is neither centrally controlled nor federal. (2) The UK believes that Germany's production capacity, as stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement, is insufficient. Therefore, Germany should be allowed to produce 11 million tons of steel annually, using the proceeds to purchase food. (3) Under the current reparations plan, the UK objects to any removal of equipment from Germany by either the Soviet Union or Western countries. Even if the Soviet Union proposes phased deductions, the UK cannot agree. Only when Germany's production increases sufficiently to cover the costs of Allied occupation and supplies will the UK be able to abandon this view. (4) The UK prefers the merger of the UK and US occupation zones to an agreement that would allow the Soviet Union to remove equipment from Germany as reparations during the period when Germany relies on UK assistance. (5) The UK remains willing to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the control of the Ruhr industrial area within a unified German structure. (6) The UK intends to propose the establishment of a central German administrative structure, including a central civil service corps, and the appointment of local government agencies with the authority to make political decisions, subject to the final approval of the occupying powers.</p>
<h3>US Drafts Disarmament Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] US officials are currently drafting a disarmament proposal that is believed could lead the world towards disarmament and ensure the security of the United States. The proposal is expected to be formally submitted to the UN General Assembly at the end of this week or the beginning of next week. Authoritative sources say the draft will require the following points as the price for countries to participate: (1) Effective guarantees that no country will undermine the established goals of disarmament. (2) Assurance that other countries will implement disarmament to the same extent as the US and fully fulfill their commitments. This plan is the US response to Molotov's disarmament proposal in the UN. The plan will be submitted to President Truman for approval before it is announced.</p>
<h3>United Nations to Control Narcotics Work</h3>
<p>Draft Passed by the General Assembly</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] At the General Assembly meeting today, China, the US, the UK, the Netherlands, and Abyssinia all urged the Assembly to quickly handle the draft agreement to transfer the League of Nations' work on combating narcotics to the UN. The Assembly unanimously passed the draft. Guo Taiqi stated that China has always supported international control of narcotics and that the Chinese delegation has been very active in the work of establishing a Narcotics Commission. Guo stated that the Chinese government would sign the draft as soon as possible. The Assembly also unanimously passed the draft today, but it will only take effect after being signed by more than 35 countries.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang in America</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 19th] San Francisco Chronicle columnist reports: General Feng Yuxiang recently purchased a house for $19,500 in Berkeley, across from San Francisco. General Feng is also "the owner of a 1946 Chrysler."</p>
<h3>Preliminary Results of Romanian Elections: Communists Predominate, Minor Bloodshed Occurs in Various Locations; Romania Assures US of Free Elections</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 20th Broadcast: Initial results from the Romanian parliamentary elections indicate that the Communist-controlled government group has a significant advantage, with opposition parties lagging far behind. Both sides accuse each other of violating election rules.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bucharest, 19th] Officials announced tonight: The parliamentary elections were conducted in peace and order, with only a few isolated incidents of bloodshed incited by the opposition, but without consequence. Voting took place in the capital's central districts, especially in major factories. Romanian officers and soldiers voted in their barracks.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bucharest, 19th] Romania elected a new parliament today. The election results will not be announced before noon tomorrow. Troops were ordered to guard polling stations. The key to this election is whether the Communist government led by Groza can retain power. The Communist government advocates strengthening relations with the Soviet Union and establishing a communist social system. The opposition supports maintaining a middle-class capitalist system.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The State Department announced that Romania has assured the US government that it will respect the democratic principles of freedom and justice in today's elections. Romanian Foreign Minister Tătărescu yesterday presented the US representative in Bucharest,  Berry, with a response to the US note. Tătărescu reiterated that the Romanian government believes the US proposal is an attempt to interfere in Romania's internal affairs, but at the same time guaranteed that the democratic principles of freedom and justice would continue to guide the general election.</p>
<h3>US Coal Miners' Strike: Significant Domestic and International Impact</h3>
<p>[United Press, Pittsburgh, 19th] Although the Federal Court has ordered a ban on the anthracite coal mine strike, the number of strikers continues to increase. Yesterday, 38,000 miners were on strike, and today another 40,000 joined, totaling approximately 78,000. 272 coal mines have been closed, resulting in a daily reduction in coal production of 20 percent. Fuel supplies to steel mills are beginning to falter, and some mines in those plants are also on strike. Whether a nationwide coal mine strike will begin remains to be seen on the 21st. John L. Lewis, former president of the Mine Workers Union, has notified the government, stating that the union contract expires on that date. Lewis has made no statements since the strike ban was issued.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The Department of the Army announced today that it is prepared to work with the Department of the Interior to intervene in the coal mine strike, but has not yet received a notification for the Army to be deployed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the impending US coal mine strike is a major blow to countries in need of US food and coal. If 400,000 anthracite coal miners across the country go on strike, the export of coal and food will inevitably cease.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Secretary of the Interior Krug predicted today that the coal mine strike would have a significant impact on all aspects of national life. According to him, within 60 days of the strike, 64 percent of electricity-powered public utilities, 60 percent of steel mills, 90 percent of coking plants, 86 percent of first-class railway companies, 90 percent of cement plants, and 70 percent of other factories would be shut down.</p>
<h3>Presentation of Material Evidence in Japanese War Crimes Trial: Likely to Exceed Scheduled End Date</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] According to reliable sources today, the US prosecutor at the Far East Tribunal had hoped to conclude the presentation of material evidence related to the 27 Japanese war criminals by early December. However, due to the insistence of the British and Philippine prosecutors on presenting all documents related to Japanese atrocities, it is feared that this deadline cannot be met. Prosecutors from the eleven countries have recently held multiple meetings, placing considerable emphasis on the importance of the conspiracy charge in the indictment. The prosecution of the defendants for "planning, inciting, and conducting aggressive war" could have been effectively concluded after US Navy Admiral Lee Richardson presents a detailed report on the attack on Pearl Harbor next week. The US prosecutor believes that by briefly presenting specific examples of Japanese military atrocities, the entire case could be completed by the second week of December.</p>
<h3>Strength of Greek Rebels Grows Daily: Over 100 Villages in Northern Border Region Under Their Control; Greek Government Plans to Appeal to the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in London, 20th] The importance of the war on the Greek-Yugoslav border is increasing daily, as Greece has announced that it will appeal to the United Nations General Assembly, requesting the UN to prevent certain countries from participating in the conflict on the Southern-Greek border. If this occurs, the UN General Assembly, which has yet to achieve much, will face new difficulties. A British Foreign Office spokesman stated that the British government has received official notification from Greece proving that Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia are participating in the Greek border conflict. The British government is currently considering this notification.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 20th Broadcast: Greek Army Chief of Staff General Spiliotopoulos flew to London by plane on Tuesday and will request increased British aid to deal with both internal and external troubles.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 19th] The strength of the rebels in the Western Macedonia region is increasing, and they have occupied over 100 villages. They also publish their own newspaper, establish their own courts, and their leaders are two elementary school teachers, with headquarters in the village of Melisssa. One of their "free zones" extends to the far west of Macedonia, only two or three miles from the city of Grevena, which can be defended by Greek government forces. Fierce fighting has taken place in the area around Mount Skra for many days, but there is now no trace of the rebels. Greek government planes and artillery were also deployed during the fighting.</p>
<p>Social Phenomena Under High-Pressure Living</p>
<h3>Japanese University Students Compete to Become Orchestra Performers</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 19th] Amidst the waves of post-war inflation, an increasing number of Japanese students are seeking jobs to pay tuition and maintain their livelihoods. Those with a skill do not have to worry about finding work. Currently, there are as many as seventeen dance hall bands in Tokyo composed of university students, each earning between 16,000 and 20,000 yen per month, which is envied by civil servants and teachers whose monthly salaries are less than 1,000 yen. According to Mr. Ohashi, a student in the music department of Keio University, the number of student-organized bands has gradually increased since April of this year. He works from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM at the Shirokiya dance hall and from 5:30 PM to 9:00 PM at the Garden dance hall, earning over 20,000 yen per month at times. However, it is still difficult to decide whether to completely abandon studies and make this a profession, or to continue studying and make this a side job. Serious consideration of the future is a cause for concern, he said.</p>

<h3>Woman Appointed as Speaker of Parliament: A First in the UK</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Labour MP Mrs. Paton was elected today as one of the twelve chairmen of this session of the House of Commons. The appointment of a woman as speaker of parliament is unprecedented in the UK. When the parliament holds standing committee meetings, Mrs. Paton will serve as chair. However, when the parliament discusses budget issues, the parliament will become a committee, and Mrs. Paton will be the chair of the entire House of Commons meeting. The chairman must be familiar with procedural law and know the names of all members of the House of Commons. Mrs. Paton's husband, Mr. Paton, is also a member of the House of Commons, and the two often sit together during meetings.</p>
<h3>China in British Eyes</h3>
<p>— From Our Correspondent in England, Zhu Zunzhusends</p>
<p>Although news from China is unfavorable, the British press does not have a particularly bad view of China. The London Times publishes news from China every day, and every one or two months, it publishes an editorial on China issues. Every year on Double Ten Day, The Times publishes articles analyzing the Chinese situation. The Times is fair in its position and criticizes the illegal and reckless actions of the CCP. Other London newspapers rarely publish China news. When they do, most are tabloid or evening newspaper styles. For example, photos of what Chinese people eat, what they wear, and young women wearing cheongsams often appear in the gossip or snippets sections of various newspapers. The News Chronicle used to publish many articles about China because of Geld, who touted the CCP. However, he himself was not sympathetic to the CCP. In fact, it was because he had disagreements with several spokespersons when he was in Chongqing, which caused him to develop a strong aversion to the entire Chinese government. When his aversion reached its peak, he became a strong supporter of the CCP. The Chronicle has gradually corrected its views on China. Their political commentator, Mr. Bartley, will soon visit China. Mr. Bartley's world political vision has always been respected by the British. His views on the September 18th Incident are completely consistent with China's point of view. The Manchester Guardian, which has always been considered sympathetic to China by the Chinese people, publishes very little news about China. When there is an editorial, its tone does not appear "sympathetic."</p>
<p>British magazines have mixed influences on China. The Economist, the most prestigious weekly magazine, often has discussions about China, and bluntly pointed out that the civil war is the root cause of all evils in China's inflation. This time, the left-wing weekly "New Statesman and Nation" has views on China that are almost like "Xinhua" and "Liberation". Its position is well known. Just like the opinions of the Daily Worker (the organ of the British Communist Party) are not taken seriously, the most successful aspect of the CCP's external propaganda is their so-called "peasant movement," boasting about their rent reduction and other land reform policies in the border areas. Most British newspapers, including The Times, believe that the CCP has a solution to this urgent social problem.</p>
<p>British people generally do not care about the Hong Kong issue. Some people are very willing to hand this island back to China. Those who object are still the same "old China hands". What the British people in the UK do not understand the most is: why do the Chinese in Hong Kong have such deep antipathy towards the British? This suspicion is very natural, because the British in Britain do not know the lifestyle of the British in colonies, semi-colonies, and sub-colonies - the arrogance of imperialists. These imperialists swagger and domineer abroad, but when they return home, their attitude changes and they are the same as ordinary, humorous British people.</p>
<p>The British do not understand China enough. Our foreign propaganda authorities should pay attention to this. However, propaganda alone is not enough. To get a nation to understand us, introducing our cultural life is one way. However, the first thing to do is to clarify the current domestic situation. Everyone knows that China has a long history and a great culture, but if all the news revealed from this great cultural background is bad news, the big question mark in foreigners' hearts will never be eliminated. (End)</p>
<h3>Although the British "Party Rebellion" Has Subsided, the Political Situation is Still Not Optimistic. The Opposition Occupies a Strong One-Third of the Entire House. The Actual Internal Division of the Labour Party Remains the Same.</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] Although the House of Commons voted 335 to zero last night to trust the government's current foreign policy, 160 Labour MPs did not vote. Excluding those who were sick or had other reasons, at least 100 Labour MPs expressed no opinion during the vote. The high proportion makes it difficult for the government to claim victory without feeling troubled. Of the members who participated in the vote, 230 were Labour, 104 were Conservative, 7 were Liberal, and 12 were from smaller parties. Supporters of the government claim that the vote of confidence is sufficient to show the world that British public opinion supports Foreign Minister Bevin. However, critics say that the large number of abstentions proves that the Labour Party's policies are actually as divided as ever, and have not been remedied by this. There is a possibility that the rebellion may happen again. The government cannot ignore this crisis and say that everything is calm and quiet. Rebellious members explained the reason for their abstention, because they cannot interpret this kind of vote as a general distrust of the government. For example, they fully agree with the government's domestic policies, and even have no objection to certain parts of foreign policy. Therefore, the government has obtained the trust of the majority in the House of Commons for only two reasons: (1) In terms of domestic affairs, the Labour Party seems to be as united as ever; (2) In terms of foreign affairs, the Conservative Party and loyal members of the Labour Party unanimously support the government.</p>

<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Facsimile Telegraph Open: Transmitting and Receiving Pictures and Photos Without Any Delay; Telegraph Fees are of Two Types: 50,000 Yuan and 20,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Beijing-Shanghai facsimile telegraph was officially opened yesterday. The transmission of text, pictures, and photos is extremely clear. The facsimile telegraph machine at the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau was installed and tested long ago. The Nanjing side also completed testing yesterday. After the opening yesterday, Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications sent a facsimile telegram to Mayor Wu, which read: "Mayor Wu Guozhen of Shanghai, Respectfully: The Ministry is exerting all efforts to improve the business of various transportation departments. Regarding the innovation of telecommunications, long-distance telephones have adopted ultra-shortwave wireless machines, telegraphs have used typing telegraph machines, and express telegrams have been launched. We strive to make communications rapid and accurate. Now, we are piloting facsimile telegrams in Beijing and Shanghai. Today is the beginning of the launch, and I respectfully extend my thoughts. I hope you will be aware of them. Your brother, Yu Dawei, November 20th."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu of Shanghai replied to Minister Yu: "Minister Yu Dawei of the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, Respectfully: I have received your telegram. I am aware that since you took over the Ministry of Communications, you have worked diligently and devoted all efforts to improving the transportation business. Adopting new-style machines and piloting facsimile telegrams means that public and private affairs can be achieved in an instant, making the country one family and connecting east and west into one place. Promotion to various places can be expected soon. I am deeply gratified. I respectfully reply by telegram. Your brother, Wu Guozhen, respectfully secret."</p>
<p>The locations for sending and receiving facsimile telegrams in this city are at the General Business Office of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, No. 70 Fuzhou Road. Before sending a telegram, you must first obtain specially made paper from that office, which is divided into two types, A and B. The fee for each type A paper is 50,000 yuan, and the fee for type B is 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Visit and Experiment</h3>
<p>[Our reporter Nanjing 20th] Beijing-Shanghai wireless facsimile has been successfully tested after months of efforts by telecommunications personnel in both places, and has been officially opened. This morning, the reporter visited the receiving station of the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau, and was personally given an experimental transmission by the director of the station, Lei Dahua, who explained about the Beijing-Shanghai facsimile. First, a form was sent from Shanghai to Beijing, and the lines and handwriting were very clear. A written document was also transmitted from Nanjing to Shanghai. A piece of paper 12 inches wide and 8 inches high can be transmitted in 8 minutes. According to the discussion: Currently, because some parts of the machine have not been installed, the transmission of photos may not be very clear, but the transmission of other facsimiles, no matter if they are written in steel pen or ink, or even blueprints, can be recognized word for word. If the situation is good, even No. 5 small font can be transmitted one by one, and experimental results were shown, with some having no major differences from ordinary printed matter</p>
<p>The facsimile machines currently used by the Beijing and Shanghai Telecommunications Bureaus were produced by the American Western Union Company in 1942. A total of four units were shipped to China, two of which are now in Nanjing and two in Shanghai. Soon, one will be shipped to Beiping. This type of machine is newer than the ones currently used in Yu-Kun, can send and receive at the same time, and has automatic equipment, which is not as troublesome as the former. The order period was very early, but due to the war, it was stored in India for a long time. It was only recently transported to Beijing via Chongqing. Due to repeated migrations, and because each unit weighs three tons, many were damaged during transport to Beijing and needed to be repaired. Therefore, this is the reason why the opening was delayed.</p>

<h3>Fire on Sheshan Waters at Midnight: Hai Tian Liner Almost Caused a Disaster; Negligence by the Escort Officer Caused the Burning of Straw on the Ship; Rescued by Tenders, the Ship Continued to Qinhuangdao Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Hai Tian, a large Liberty ship of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company operating on the Shanghai-Qinhuangdao line, caught fire at approximately 12:00 midnight on the 19th after weighing anchor and departing from Shanghai. After reaching the waters off Sheshan outside Wusongkou, a fire suddenly broke out. The customs patrol boat heard the alarm and rushed to the rescue, and the fire was extinguished. The deck was slightly damaged. The ship sailed to Qinhuangdao in the early morning yesterday. Afterwards, according to the truth obtained by a reporter from the East China News Agency from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the company received a fire report from the Hai Tian via radio the night before and immediately sent staff to investigate. Regarding the cause of the fire, it was due to the negligence of the escort officer who accompanied the cargo of flammable straw, which caused the straw to burn. Fortunately, the crew and customs patrol boat officers worked hard to rescue and extinguish the fire. Only two escort officers were burned, and they were taken to Shanghai by the bureau's ambulance boat yesterday morning and sent to the hospital for treatment. Their lives are not in danger. It is also known that the Hai Tian is the bureau's largest Liberty ship, with a deadweight tonnage of over 10,000 tons. This time, it was sailing to Qinhuangdao to load coal for Shanghai.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Landing Craft Aground Near Wanxian: Cargo Damaged by Dampness, Crew and Passengers Safe; French Ship "Songdan" Has Not Yet Sailed Out</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Landing craft of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are dispatched to Shanghai and Chongqing, because the landing craft have shallow drafts and high speeds, so they are suitable for traveling long rivers. It is reported that the landing craft "Hua" No. 210 loaded cargo from Chongqing on the 13th of this month and sailed downstream. At approximately 9:00 AM the next morning, it ran aground on a reef near Wanjiang Shibaozhai. The front cabin was breached, and the river water seeped in, damaging the cargo with dampness. Fortunately, the crew and passengers were safe. The ship sent an electric message for help. The Yichang Branch received the message and sent a barge to rescue. After receiving the report, the head office also sent the landing craft "Hua" No. 208 to tow and rescue. According to the report of the ship, the river water has gradually receded in recent days. Yesterday, the bow of ship No. 210 was only inches, and the stern only slightly more than two feet, from the water. Although the rice and other cargo were removed, the ship body struck the reef and still could not float. Therefore, there is no way to tow it away for the time being. Rescue is continuing.</p>
<p>The French ship "Songdan", which arrived in Shanghai for the first time after the war, arrived in port on the 29th of last month. It was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to France on the 14th of this month, but after a slight repair in Shanghai, it was rescheduled to weigh anchor on the 16th. Unexpectedly, the crew suddenly made demands, which prevented it from sailing out. As of the 18th, it had not yet been resolved. The company immediately wired the Paris headquarters for instructions. The reply has not yet been received, so the return date of the ship to France is still uncertain. In addition to French expatriates returning to France, some of the passengers are Hong Kong passengers who have been refunded their tickets and switched to other ships. The company's regular liner "Andre Lebon" departed from Marseille on the 15th of last month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month.</p>

On the same day, a board of directors meeting was also held, and the oath of office ceremony was held.</p>
<h3>Disputes over the Hardoon Estate: Nationality Issue to Become the Focus of Contention; Management Insists Hardoon was British; Twelve Iraqi Relatives Decide to Sue</h3>
<p>[Special Report] Regarding the Hardoon estate, twelve Iraqi relatives have recently sent representatives to Shanghai to initiate litigation for a share of the inheritance. Details of this situation were reported in this newspaper on the 11th. According to the Hardoon Estate Management, although Hardoon was originally from Iraq, it is a well-known fact that he naturalized as a British citizen. The British Consulate in Shanghai at the time issued him a passport, which serves as strong evidence. However, the twelve relatives insist that Hardoon did not obtain British citizenship through legal procedures and can also provide evidence to that effect. Therefore, Hardoon's nationality will be the focal point of contention in the estate case between the two parties. The current consideration for the twelve individuals is the amount of the litigation target. Based on current valuations, the Hardoon estate is estimated to be worth over 50 billion legal tender. If this amount is used as the basis for the lawsuit, the litigation fees would amount to a staggering 650 million yuan. Most of the Hardoon estate consists of real estate, with over thirty properties, totaling over 400 mu of land, as well as the Cishu and Hardoon buildings. Currently, real estate income is not as high as it used to be, with the total monthly income from Hardoon's real estate being only over 40 million yuan. George Hardoon, Luo Youlan, and over ten others each receive just over 2 million yuan per month, leading many to believe that it is unwise for the twelve Iraqis to spend a large sum of litigation fees on a lawsuit with no certainty of success.

<h3>Lai Lingnai, Suspected of Instigating the Zang Case, Prosecuted by the District Procuratorate</h3>
<p>[Special Report] Lai Lingnai, a Spanish sailor suspected of instigating the death of Zang Da's son, has had his case investigated and closed by the District Procuratorate, and has been prosecuted according to law. The indictment is as follows: "On September 22nd of this year, at approximately 10:00 PM, Lai Lingnai took a rickshaw from the Seamen's Club to the Huadu Ballroom on Zhongzheng East Road, alighting and entering without paying the fare. The rickshaw puller Zang Da's son waited for ten minutes and saw him leave the ballroom, heading east, and went forward to demand the fare. Lai Lingnai ignored him. Zang Da's son stepped forward and grabbed his arm; the rickshaw pullers nearby also shouted for money. Lai Lingnai, seeing this, suspected he would be beaten. Coincidentally, an American sailor passed by and he called for help. Without asking the circumstances, the sailor punched Zang Da's son in the chest. Zang Da's son fell to the ground, his head injured, suffering a concussion and dying. Zang Da's death was due to the concussion caused by the injuries he sustained before his death, as verified by the prosecutor and forensic doctor, with a report attached. The defendant Lai Lingnai also admitted that the rickshaw puller Zang Da's son was punched to the ground by the American sailor due to a fare dispute; however, he denies instigating the act. However, according to the rickshaw pullers Ren Xiaozhu and Liao Yuanshou, who were present at the time, they both saw the defendant Lai Lingnai say a few words to the sailor before the sailor punched the rickshaw puller. However, they did not understand his words. Considering the circumstances, the defendant Lai Lingnai is suspected of instigating others to injure someone, resulting in death, violating Article 277, Paragraph 2, and Article 219 of the Criminal Law. He is hereby prosecuted under Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Prosecutor Ji Su."</p>

<p>[Special Report] Regarding the issue of the return of American plasma, a reasonable solution was reached yesterday afternoon after Mayor Wu convened relevant parties for consultation. The meeting began at 2:30 PM, with representatives from the US Materials Clearance Committee, Lida International Trading Company, the US Consulate, and the US Navy in attendance. The consultation proceeded in a harmonious atmosphere. The Mayor guaranteed that all plasma stocks would be returned. At the same time, the US side was very satisfied with the cooperation of the purchaser and the government, and immediately expressed its willingness to repay the price with goods, so that the merchants would not suffer losses. Both parties immediately agreed to this principle. As for what kind of goods to exchange, it will be determined by the US side and then consulted with our side.</p>
<p>After the agreement was reached, Mayor Wu held a press conference, reading the English statement issued by President Song of the Executive Yuan regarding this matter, which stated: "Regarding the discovery of plasma in a large batch of drugs sold by the US Materials Clearance Committee to a Chinese trading company, the Chinese government had no prior knowledge of this matter before the news was disclosed in the newspapers. Chinese merchants purchased it completely legally; however, the government cannot allow plasma donated by the American people to the Red Cross to be sold. Yesterday, I instructed Mayor Wu to seal the plasma inventory and to enable the US Clearance Committee and the purchasing trading company to reach an agreement so that it could be resolved reasonably according to ordinary procedures. I am now pleased that the parties concerned have reached an agreement and the buyer has agreed to return the blood to the US Consulate through the Municipal Government today.

No Chinese government agency has participated in this matter."</p>

<h3>Advising Stores to Voluntarily Conserve Electricity: Mayor to Conduct Field Inspections Soon</h3>
<p>[Special Report] Many stores in the city still use decorative lights at night to attract customers, and although the authorities have repeatedly advised against this, merchants and residents continue to light them as usual.

It is reported that in September, the Shanghai Electric Power Company supplied cotton mills with 18.37 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, and in October, the supply was 20.47 million kilowatt-hours.

<h3>Fifteen Film and Drama Professionals to be Interrogated by High Court Today; Two Questionable Films Reviewed Yesterday; Written Opinions Submitted on the Spot; Authorities Hope Those Reported Will Respect the Judiciary and Report When Summoned</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Procuratorate of the High Court of this city is scheduled to continue its investigation into film and drama professionals suspected of collaborating with the enemy at 9:00 AM this morning. This second group summoned includes Li Huan, Chen Yunshang, Chen Yanyan, Mei Xi, Liu Zhonghao, Zhang Shichuan, Xu Xinfu, Zhou Shimu, Bian Ying, Shi Tingpan, Hu Jinkang, Jin Longzhang, Zhang Xiaohai, Zhong Baoxuan, and Wu Zhongshan, fifteen people in total. However, because some summonses have not been delivered, it is feared that many will be unable to appear in court at that time.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] During the period of the city's occupation, many people in the film and drama industry remained in Shanghai to work. After the victory, discussions about the issue of reporting film personnel who collaborated with the enemy were very heated, but no results were seen. Until recently, a certain organization suddenly presented a list of dozens of people to the Procuratorate of the High Court, reporting them, and the procuratorate is now summoning and investigating them in batches. This move has made film personnel who stayed in Shanghai in the past feel uneasy all day long. The impact has been so great that the budding film industry is almost at a standstill. In order to clarify right and wrong, and to avoid wrongly accusing anyone, the City Party Department, in conjunction with relevant organizations and groups, held a screening of the two questionable films "The Regret of Spring River" and "Ge Shi's Everlasting Fame" at the Huguang Theater yesterday morning for review. Present were Fang Zhi, Xie Renzhao, Sun Dongcheng, and Xu Mingya from the City Party Department; Wang Guanqing from the Municipal Government; Luo Xuelian from the Central Propaganda Department; Li Ximou and Peng Zhenqiu from the Education Bureau; Chen Shenxiu and Xia Jingtao from the Social Affairs Bureau; Du Tongsun and Jiang Bin from the Film Censorship Office; Wu Huasheng from the Youth Corps; Liu Deming from the Military Friends Society; Zhu Renyi from Zhongdian; Liang Gengshun and Yang Shounian from the District Procuratorate; Zhang Che from the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Movement Committee; and reporters from various newspapers, totaling thirty to forty people. Qu Rong, the prosecutor in charge of the High Court's investigation of film and drama personnel who collaborated with the enemy, also attended with a clerk. "The Regret of Spring River" was shown first at 9:00 AM, followed by a ten-minute break, and then "Ge Shi's Everlasting Fame" was screened. It was already 1:30 PM when it was finished. All participants in the review received an opinion form. After gathering opinions on the two films anonymously, they were sealed on the spot and sent to the High Court Procuratorate as reference for the investigation.</p>
<p>Thoughts After Viewing</p>
<p>City Party Department Chairman Fang said after watching: "Ge Shi's Everlasting Fame" was filmed before "The Regret of Spring River." As a historical film, it was remarkable that it could say "Chinese people will not be slaves to a fallen nation" under Japanese military rule at the time. The Japanese were probably not satisfied with "Ge Shi's Everlasting Fame," which led to "The Regret of Spring River." And there were Japanese people involved. What is noteworthy in the film is that when the subtitles appeared, the Japanese were always first, and the Chinese were last. And the drama subtly emerged from creation. As far as I know, the Japanese Sonno Joi movement had no connection with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." City Party Department Secretary-General Xie Renzhao also said: "'Ge Shi's Everlasting Fame' narrates Lin Zexu's suppression of opium and resistance to the British. At that time, British imperialism did act in this way, and there were indeed organizations such as the Pingying Tuan in various places. Therefore, this film should be viewed in two points: firstly, in terms of narrating history, there is nothing wrong with it. Secondly, in terms of international relations, since Britain is now an ally, it seems to be problematic. Regarding the conclusion in 'The Regret of Spring River' that the Japanese sympathized with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, there seems to be no such record in history. The Japanese emphasized it in order to make the Chinese people feel good about them."</p>
<p>Before the participants in the film viewing filled out their review opinions, Chairman Fang said: "I hope everyone will criticize from an objective standpoint, and I hope that those who have been reported will report to the court according to the summons, and respect the judiciary in everything."</p>
<h3>Jiang Shangpei and Others Declared Not Guilty; Xie Guangming Sentenced to Two and a Half Years</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court announced verdicts yesterday in two cases of suspected traitors: (1) Jiang Shangpei, Director of the Judicial Section of the New City Police Bureau of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, Deputy Detective Xie Guangming, Li Yongde, and Detective Chief Xu Shu were accused of illegally detaining people and infringing on their personal freedom by taking advantage of their power. Jiang, now the Director of the Judicial Section of the Laozha District Bureau in this city, denied illegally detaining merchants during the trial, and stated that the reason he continued to serve in the puppet police bureau was to participate in intelligence work for the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League, which was testified by Yang Wenguang of the Fourth Detachment of the Shanghai Branch. He also participated in the anti-enemy police affairs led by Gan Jingxian, which can be proven by letters from Wu Tiecheng and Yu Hongjun to Qian Dajun. When Wei Zhongda, who is now employed by the Garrison Headquarters, was victimized that year, Jiang rescued him from danger and provided travel expenses, which was also testified by Feng. Yesterday, Jiang, Li, and Xu were all declared not guilty. Xie Guangming was sentenced to two years and six months.</p>
<p>Wang Zhenchuan Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>

<h3>Gas, Ferry, and Small Train Fares to be Adjusted Soon; Zhao Zengjue Reported at the Municipal Council Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, reported to the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council yesterday afternoon on the process of adjusting public utility prices. He stated that the Public Utilities Bureau believes that public utility companies should be given reasonable profits and that the reliability of their profits should be protected, otherwise no one will be willing to invest in public utilities. This adjustment will not be made for those that can be maintained, such as the Shanghai Telephone Company, which charges based on the number of calls. The current increase in the number of calls has exceeded expectations, and the revenue has increased, so it is not at a loss. Therefore, no adjustment was made at all. Those that cannot be maintained will be reasonably adjusted based on their income and expenditure. So far, those that have been approved include electricity, tap water, trams, and buses. Those that are being considered include gas and ferries. The small trains on the Jidu, Shangnan, and Shangchuan lines will be announced soon. The bureau's approval of the prices of various companies this time is to provide reasonable profits on the one hand, and to urge them to increase capital and expand equipment on the other hand, in order to meet the needs of the public, such as ordering various power companies to add generators, ordering British and French tram companies to increase vehicles, and handling the track connection from Jing'an Temple to Xujiahui Road. This week, the preparatory office of the Public Transportation Company was also ordered to increase the number of buses and pay road maintenance fees and license fees in the same way as other companies. In short, on the one hand, reasonable remuneration is given, and on the other hand, they are ordered to improve service efficiency.</p>

<h3>Clearing Accumulated Coffins in the City; Health Bureau Sets Deadline for Transfer Out of the City by Next Spring; Overdue Coffins Will Be Concentrated for Cremation by District</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to improve the environmental hygiene of this city, the Health Bureau has decided to thoroughly clear the accumulated coffins in funeral homes, temporary coffin storage places, and open spaces in various districts of the city. The original deadline for the coffins of owners to be transferred out of the city was the end of the year, but it has now been extended to the end of March next year, so that the owners can have sufficient time. After the deadline, all coffins stored in Shanghai will be treated as ownerless and will be concentrated for cremation by district.</p>
<p>It is understood that more than 97,000 accumulated coffins in the city have been registered with the Health Bureau, and there are also many unregistered or exposed in barren land. The total number is estimated to be more than 100,000. A part of the ownerless ones are mostly broken and decayed, and the foul smell is overflowing. Therefore, the district offices in various districts have repeatedly requested the transfer of these broken coffins. Now the Health Bureau has decided to handle the accumulated coffins in the city in a unified manner and adopt the most thorough method of cremation, with a deadline for implementation. In the future, the establishment of temporary coffin storage places will also be banned. Funeral homes will be allowed to store coffins for a maximum of ten days. On the one hand, the government will establish a coffin transportation office to assist families in transporting coffins out of the urban area.</p>
<p>Since the decision on this method, many coffin owners have complained that it is difficult to relocate and bury the coffins due to lack of land and money, and have called on the authorities to open more public cemeteries for burial. However, according to the Health Bureau, it is determined to clear the accumulated coffins and cannot allow the difficulties of a few people to affect the environmental hygiene of the majority. As for opening more public cemeteries, it is not in line with the principle of promoting cremation and reducing public cemeteries in the new urban plan. Moreover, public cemeteries require land. If each acre can bury 100 coffins, then 100,000 coffins require 1,000 acres. Moreover, there is an average of about 6,000 deaths per month. Not to mention that the municipal government lacks huge funds to purchase land, the value of land use is also extremely uneconomical. At the same time, it is better for coffins with owners to pay a fee to transport them to the countryside for burial once and for all than to store them in public cemeteries and pay storage fees. Therefore, the Health Bureau hopes that the owners can comply with the deadline for relocation.</p>
<h3>Abundant Inventory and Tight Credit; US Goods Expected to Fall, Not Rise; Generally Believed that the Trend of Smuggling is Difficult to Eradicate</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the announcement of the import permit system, the market price of US goods in this city has not fluctuated, and there has been no phenomenon of customers crowding into US goods markets. People in the industry told reporters that the inventory of US goods in this city is very large, and the credit is very tight, so the price of goods will only fall, not rise. Business people believe that the implementation of the import permit system will not raise the market price of US goods in the short term, but if it is implemented effectively, it will have an impact in the long term. But whether this is the case depends on whether smuggling can be cracked down on. Most people do not believe that smuggling can be completely eradicated, because smugglers have extremely strong backgrounds and strength, and the methods of smuggling are also extremely varied. Under the current new method of control, smuggling may even become more rampant. Under the influence of this kind of psychology in the market, the market price of US goods will not fluctuate.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Underground Money Shops; Rewarding Citizens for Reporting</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, ordering the strict crackdown on underground money shops in Taishi, and rewarding citizens for reporting them. The original order said: "Since prices have risen sharply and market interest rates have increased with commercial profits, so-called 'underground money shops' have emerged, illegally engaging in banking business and lending at usurious rates, exploiting and profiting, disrupting finance, and fueling speculation. Although they have been repeatedly seized and ordered to stop operating and fined in accordance with the penalties for privately established banks and shops stipulated in the Ministry's Measures for the Management of Banks, these money shops are mostly temporary combinations, attached to residences or shops. It is not easy to seize them. Even if they are discovered, they can still be relocated and operated as before after being punished. Obviously, their actions have violated criminal law and should be severely punished according to law in order to prohibit them.</p>
<p>Article 344 of Chapter 33 of the Criminal Law on Fraud, Breach of Trust, and Usury stipulates: "Whoever takes advantage of another's urgency, rashness, or inexperience to lend money or other items and obtains a usurious interest that is clearly disproportionate to the principal shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than one year, detention, or a concurrent fine of not more than one thousand yuan." Article 345 stipulates, "Whoever makes a profession of committing the crime in the preceding article shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than five years and may be concurrently fined not more than three thousand yuan." Underground money shops are able to run rampant because they take advantage of people's urgency, rashness, and inexperience to carry out their usurious lending and illegal profit-seeking schemes. In the future, whenever such cases are discovered, the details of the unauthorized establishment of banks and shops should still be reported to the Ministry for punishment in accordance with the Measures for the Management of Banks. The parts that violate criminal law should also be sent directly to the competent court with the criminals' credentials for investigation and handling in accordance with the law in order to punish and warn. Please immediately instruct your subordinates to strictly investigate these underground money shops and reward those who report them in order to stop them, and you should also make a detailed announcement to all industries and businesses that if they need to raise funds, they should go to legally established banks and money shops and handle them according to the correct procedures, or apply for small industrial loans from local financial institutions (provincial and municipal bank branches) in accordance with the regulations, so as to avoid being exploited by illegal lenders with usurious interest."</p>
<h3>Principals and Professors Serve as Councilors</h3>
<p>Council Again Requests Interpretation from the Judicial Yuan</p>
<p>Regarding the issue that principals of public schools at all levels may not concurrently serve as councilors of provincial, county, and municipal councils, the Ministry of Interior Affairs replied by telegram, "The Judicial Yuan has already issued an interpretation on the case, and this Ministry has no right to correct it." Details have been recorded in various newspapers. Citizens throughout the city are paying close attention, especially councilors who are in a situation where they cannot hold both positions and are studying the issue of choosing between them. Candidate councilors also hope to be announced as soon as possible so that they can fill the vacancies. However, reporters specifically visited the council authorities yesterday. It is said that the council is already preparing to ask the Ministry of Interior Affairs to submit the matter to the Judicial Yuan for further interpretation, for four reasons: (1) No democratic countries have regulations that principals and professors may not serve as councilors. Since China is a democratic country, it should allow them to compete in elections. (2) In this country, councilors and representatives of the National Assembly are also allowed to participate in the National Assembly without any prohibitions. Councilors have the same nature as councilors and representatives of the National Assembly, and there should be no regulations prohibiting them from holding both positions. (3) Although principals of public schools are appointed, there is no clear distinction between simple recommendation and committee levels, so they cannot be equated with civil servants in general. (4) In today's world, where the whole country advocates education to build the country and respects teachers and values education, it cannot be considered wrong to have educators represent the people.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: The article published in your newspaper on the 18th of this month regarding the beating of Wenzhou workers at the Rihui Port Wharf is inconsistent with the facts. On that day, the dispute was originally caused by Wenzhou worker Jiang Xueqin leading a crowd to destroy the fifth and sixth branches of the association, beating and injuring staff members Zhang Xingkun and Xu Zhengyang, as well as the family members of the executive director of the association, and destroying all public property and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. Zhang Xingkun is still in Guangci Hospital. Therefore, in addition to the Social Affairs Bureau handling the matter, the association has already filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. We are sincerely afraid that the rumors are inaccurate, so please investigate and correct them. Shanghai Nanshi District Wharf Transportation Industry Trade Union</p>

<p>(2) Jiang Fen wrote in a letter: "My husband passed away in August of this year. There is an old aunt of sixty above and young children below. The family is poor.

<h3>Importers' Registration Notice: Chen Changtong Explains in Detail to Various Banks</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Changtong, the Director of the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Control Committee, held a meeting yesterday at 1:00 PM on the fourth floor of the Bank of China, gathering responsible personnel from designated banks, both Chinese and foreign. Mr. Chen provided detailed explanations regarding the revised measures, implementing regulations, and the various application forms that had been issued. He also answered questions raised by the banks. The meeting concluded at approximately 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Most designated banks received the Import Registration Application Instructions and the four types of application forms issued by the committee yesterday morning. However, due to printing constraints, the number of copies distributed was insufficient.

<h3>### Tight Trading Range, US Dollar Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>The Shanghai currency market (烚赤) was extremely stable yesterday, with a very tight trading range. The opening price was 2.498 million, and it rose to 2.505 million at one point. Supply and demand were light, and buyers felt a bit cold, causing a slight decline. The low price fell to 2.485 million, and the Central Bank immediately allocated 60 million at a price of 2.485 million. After 10:00 AM, it became more stable. At noon, it struggled around 2.49 million. The afternoon sentiment was slightly better. It was reported that the Hong Kong currency (申鈔) had fallen in Hong Kong, and the next-day delivery rose to over 2.5 million. As a result, it rose by 10,000 compared to the previous close. Ornaments gold was 66,000, silver dollar was flat, the underground lending market (暗拆) was still stable, and the interest rate was from 12 to 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were even more relaxed and abundant yesterday, and buying interest was not easy to stimulate. The US dollar's unofficial market (暗市) started at 4,550 yuan and then fell again. At noon, it fell to between 4,420 yuan and 4,470 yuan, down 100 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong currency had less supply than demand, and telegraphic transfers were sluggish. As a result, it fell another 10 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate fell from 915 yuan to 905 yuan with supply. The Indian exchange rate was 1,100 yuan. The British exchange rate fell from 14,800 yuan to 14,600 yuan. Only Hong Kong exchange had some transactions, and the rest were silent. The US exchange rate remained stagnant.</p>
<h3>### Requiring 50,000 Pieces, Allocation Reduced by 60%: Cotton Yarn Supply and Demand Issues, Other Ports and Three Associations Request Assistance in Fair Allocation</h3>
<p>Since the distribution of yarn for the replica product industry, the yarn distribution under the supervision of the Spinning Management Committee has recently included the camel wool weaving, canvas weaving, and ribbon weaving industries. The three industry associations requested the Spinning Management Committee to uniformly allocate yarn, and it is expected to be approved. Furthermore, they will join the Replica Distribution Association to handle the same. These three industries have about 300 member factories, mostly small and medium-sized enterprises, and the amount of yarn needed is still limited. As for dyeing, knitting, underwear, towel, blanket, handmade cotton weaving, and handkerchief industries, the supplementary reporting of yarn distribution for member factories has been compiled and reported. The Spinning Management Committee will hold a meeting today to consider it. According to news from the Replica Distribution Association, the total amount applied for in November was originally 40,013 pieces. After the Spinning Management Committee decided to temporarily allocate yarn at a 60% discount, a total of 24,000 pieces were allocated. These are distributed in four installments. Tomorrow is the fourth installment. The quantity was originally insufficient. In addition, too much of the 10-count coarse yarn allocated in the past installments was unsuitable, and a few factories could not afford to pay in time and gave up. The Replica Distribution Association did not transfer the yarn to the households with shortages, resulting in a shortage of fine yarn for most. As a result, a small amount of fine yarn was still returned. The general factories felt that the amount was increasingly insufficient, and those who relied on the stock of yarn to make up for it became increasingly scarce. If there is no remedy for the supply of yarn, the reduction in production in the replica industry is inevitable. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the Replica Distribution Association, had already advised the industry not to add more machines and not to rush to restore the old factories that had been shut down. He also stated that although there was an allocation of cotton yarn, there was no way to supply the additional and restored machines. Recently, various replica industries have been investigating their member factories in batches to strictly crack down on false reports. According to the recent statistics reported to the Spinning Management Committee, the six replica industries have a total of 1,889 member factories, with 66,722 various looms, requiring a total of 42,316 pieces of various count cotton yarn, equivalent to 51,526 pieces of 20-count standard yarn. If calculated at 60% discount, it would be more than 30,000 pieces per month. On the yarn mill side, this is considered too much, while on the replica factory side, it is still insufficient. How should we coordinate and adjust this? All relevant parties expressed anxiety. In addition, the cotton yarn replica industries in the interior have also requested allocation. It is heard that the Spinning Management Committee has paid close attention to it. According to news from relevant parties, since the reorganization of the yarn allocation mechanism, the output of 10-count yarn from yarn mills has increased considerably, while the replica industry in this city does not need it. The cost of 10-count yarn is lower, and the profit is thicker. However, it is a pity that equipment that can spin 20-count yarn is reduced to spin 10-count yarn.</p>
<h3>### Southern Transport of Yarn and Cloth: Review Comes to an End</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Spinning Management Committee's review of the amount of yarn and cloth that various manufacturers applied to transport to the south came to an end yesterday. Among them, 23 companies were requested by the committee to revise their applications because the amount applied for exceeded the limit. The rest have been issued transport permits one after another. In addition, the committee has decided to accept applications starting today for yarn mills that used to operate as distributors and have applied for the qualifications of distributors.</p>
<h3>### Unified Bonds Fall Back</h3>
<p>Public bonds were flat again yesterday. A major player sold off on the fifth floor. The Unified Bond C opened at 1,450 yuan in the morning and gradually declined from 1,540 yuan, finally falling below 1,400 yuan to end the day. As a result, it fell 90 yuan from the previous close. A, B, and E each fell 80 yuan, and Unified Bond D fell 100 yuan. The trading volume was more than 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>### Securities Industry Recession</h3>
<p>Since the opening of deferred trading in the stock market in this city, it has remained in a recession due to the extremely tight credit and the heavy pressure of high-interest loans. Xietai, broker No. 51 of the Securities Exchange at No. 180 Nanjing Road, voluntarily suspended business yesterday morning. Several other companies are also about to run aground.</p>
<h3>### Foreign Currency Not Allowed for Exchange Settlement: Central Bank Reaffirms Previous Prohibition</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the revision of the import and export trade measures, the Central Bank issued Circular No. 61, notifying designated foreign exchange banks to slightly revise the original regulations and abolish the provisions of Circulars No. 1, 26, 42, 45, and 54 (except paragraph 6). Among them, Circular No. 45 stipulates that foreign currency should not be used to offset foreign debt. Now that the circular has been abolished, whether foreign currency can be used to offset foreign exchange in the future has attracted attention from all parties. It is now learned that the Central Bank has reissued Circular No. 62 stating that after the cancellation of Circular No. 45, designated banks are still not allowed to accept foreign currency to offset foreign exchange for non-import purposes that have not been approved by the Central Bank in advance.</p>
<h3>### Oil, Rice, and Grains All Show Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the north and south rice markets continued to arrive. Registered cargo amounted to 16,000 piculs (石), with lackluster retail sales. Southern japonica rice flooded the market, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Northern japonica rice of medium and lower grades also fell by 300-500 yuan. Indica rice remained stable due to firm production prices. White yuan fell by 1,000 yuan, while silver yuan increased several times. Flour mills continued to supply, but sentiment was weak, and miscellaneous brands fell by another 100-200 yuan. Wheat remained flat. Soybean arrivals increased today, and retail sales in this street were still good, with high prices but stagnant transactions. Sesame was scarce and stable. There were no large-scale purchases of raw peanuts from both the South Seas and this street, and there were few transactions. The market fell again by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Soybean cake from Fujian and Shantou had weak purchases, falling by 100-200 yuan. The oil market traded as usual today. Soybean oil sales were strong, falling by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Raw oil was stable.</p>
<h3>### Hankou Gang and Others Sell Off in Large Quantities: Soybean Oil Even Falls Below Negotiated Price</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The new negotiated price for cooking oil was implemented yesterday. However, oil prices continued to fall because the Hankou Gang sold off 1,000-2,000 loads of soybean oil, and merchants also frequently sold off, so the market price fell below the limit of the new negotiated price. The average price of cooking oil in each store was 1,000-2,000 yuan lower than the negotiated price. Soybean oil was 131,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil was 127,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, various private factories continued to allocate 500 loads of oil, including 100 loads from Dachangxin, 160 loads from Dayouyu, 65 loads from Changde, and 15 loads from Weimin. All of the above were soybean oil. Dasheng allocated 20 loads and Dadeshin allocated 80 loads, all of which were rapeseed oil. The Shanghai Food Oil Joint Allocation Office distributed the oil to 142 retail stores in the Hongkou district. Payment for this allocation is due today, and delivery will be made tomorrow.</p>
<p>In addition, after various oil presses in this city obtained soybeans supplied by the Central Trust Bureau, the raw material problem can be solved. Today, Xie Yuxiang and Zhang Chao from the oil industry will negotiate with the Central Trust Bureau on purchase procedures.</p>
<h3>### Dispute over Opening Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Cloth Factories Find It Difficult to Obtain Yarn and Are Willing to Exchange Cloth for Yarn</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] There were still few transactions in the yarn market yesterday. Initially, Yong'an Yarn Factory planned to sell 100 pieces of 20-count Jincheng yarn at the official price, and Shenxin Yarn Factory also planned to sell 100 pieces of yarn, limited to old customers who had previously traded. However, people in the industry raised objections, believing that this was not an impartial way, and there was a dispute. The two factories therefore did not open up sales temporarily. Because there is less gruel and more monks, it is not enough to distribute. Outside the market, transactions were restricted by the Bureau regulations, and there was no trading. It was difficult for general customers to handle goods urgently, and there was a situation where money was prepared but goods could not be bought.</p>
<p>The cloth market is currently stable after Mayor Wu instructed cloth industry representatives to pay attention to solidarity. However, because the inventory is too small, once customers search and purchase, the price will rise. General weaving factories find it extremely difficult to obtain yarn and are unwilling to sell in the market, preferring to exchange yarn for cloth, so that raw materials will not be scarce. This kind of barter method is really out of necessity. Colored cloth is also in short supply of dyes, and prices are expensive. Therefore, No. 190 Shilin also rose by 4,000-5,000 yuan yesterday. Longtou fine cloth is currently priced at 92,000 yuan, blue chicken fine cloth is priced at 90,000 yuan, and four gentlemen white printed drills are currently priced at 98,000 yuan. Shilin cloth is priced at 145,000-146,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>### Mostly Closing Transactions: Chinese Stocks Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were the last day for deferred delivery yesterday, and sentiment was even more anxious. Both supply and demand were mostly closing transactions. The market was extremely erratic, initially high and then low. The opening prices of various stocks in the morning showed low prices first. After No. 229 and No. 151 bought in, the buying intention on the surface was strong, and the chips were strangely scarce. It gradually rose. After 10:45, it started to turn from strong to flat. Outside the market, supply gradually became abundant. Nos. 8, 9, 4 and 151 were selling. Even if No. 111 tried hard to buy Dier Yong yarn, it could not support it. However, around 11:30, Nos. 87 and 198 came in. After No. 229 released and then re-entered Dier Yong yarn, it was easy to pull it up after the low price. However, the surface and the floating shorts competed to sell, and the American Asian (美亞) fell sharply. At noon, it retreated to a new low price.

The surface also entered, and the chips saw scarcity. It gradually pulled higher. Nos. 38 and 176 sold strongly at high prices, but buying interest was very strong, but it only struggled slightly. As a result, Dier Yong yarn, American Asia, Jingfu, and Xinguang each fell slightly from the previous close. Xinyi rose slightly. Qinxing had the support of deferred delivery and rose by nearly 10%. Among the cold stocks, China Textile, Match, Cement, and Huafeng rose slightly. The rest fell slightly to half a percent. There were no transactions for Yong public stock in deferred delivery.

<h3>### White Coal Stops Falling and Turns Stable</h3>
<p>The white coal market, screened lumps, slightly increased its inflow on the low side, and the market gradually became stable. Bituminous coal, due to the imminent payment period for small peers to distribute goods, those who could not afford to purchase could only sell at a lower price, and the market price once softened. Now, because the payment period has arrived, the outflow of this batch of coal is scarce, and the market price has returned to firmness. Since the shortage of Hongji chip coal for coal balls, the allocation of goods from various factories has been reduced, and the supply has become insufficient. All coal shops are struggling to cope. The door-to-door price of normal burning coal balls has risen to 10,000 yuan per load.</p>
<h3>### Central Yarn White Sugar Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw an increase in the spot availability of Zhongsha white sugar, and there was no shortage. Therefore, the price fell. The association set the price of Zhongsha white sugar at 136,000-137,000 yuan, down 7,000 yuan. Raw sugar red sugar was 116,000 yuan, down 6,000 yuan. The Shantou gang opened to sell 100+ bags of Chongti Qing sugar at 98,000 yuan and Huanggang Qing sugar at 96,000 yuan. The Jian gang opened to sell several hundred bags of Diao Qing sugar at 95,500 yuan, with little change.</p>
<h3>### American Cotton Reverses and Falls</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] The cotton market reversed today, with closing prices down 75 cents to 2.15 dollars per bale, due to fears of a coal miners' strike and the authorities' preparation to tighten supervision of commercial transactions, causing panic and a rush to sell.</p>
<h3>### Southeast Asian Market: British and Americans Have Already Taken the Lead: National Goods Are Too Expensive and Transportation Is Difficult</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Relevant people told reporters: Currently, trade between China and Southeast Asia is very sluggish. In the past, when foreign goods had not arrived in the Southeast Asian region, there was an urgent need and the standards for goods were not high. Therefore, a considerable amount of Chinese yarn and some daily necessities were transported to the south. But today, the situation is completely different. British and American goods have been transported to Southeast Asia in large quantities, and China's own yarn supply is insufficient; the cost of goods is high, and even if they are transported to Southeast Asia, it is difficult to open up sales channels. Transportation is also a difficult problem. Currently, only ships of the Java Shipping Company are sailing to Southeast Asia. A few weeks ago, a Southeast Asian merchant came to Shanghai to purchase goods, but returned empty-handed because the high prices in Shanghai made him afraid to act. As for the import of Southeast Asian goods, the number is also very scarce. Occasionally, some coconut oil and rubber are shipped out, but the number is also not large. Overseas Chinese hope for domestic goods very much, but the motherland really cannot satisfy their eagerness. Looking forward to Southeast Asian trade, it is currently difficult to be optimistic.</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Begins Preparing for Students to Participate in Military Training</h3>
<p>National Training Results Not Satisfactory</p>
<p>The Ministry of National Defense recently issued a nationwide order requiring all high school and above students to receive military training this year. The families of students in this city are extremely concerned. The reporter specially visited Li Ximou, the deputy director of the Bureau of Education. According to the conversation, the issue of military training for high school and above students this year has only been seen in the newspapers. The bureau has not yet received the order from the Ministry of National Defense. However, in order to prepare all the city's students to receive military training, the bureau recently sent personnel to various schools to investigate the current situation of "National Training". The results were not satisfactory. The reason is that the teachers dispatched by the Ministry of National Defense to various schools to teach "National Training" lack combat experience. Therefore, once military training is implemented, the actual ability of the teachers seems to be weak. Therefore, the bureau has prepared a document to the Ministry of Education to be forwarded to the Ministry of National Defense, stating that the teachers dispatched to various schools to teach military training in the future must have the following two qualifications: (1) Must have actual combat experience, (2) Must be graduates of the Central Military Academy. In this way, both knowledge and experience will be abundant, and the foundation for students to receive military training can be laid.</p>

The survey forms for all impoverished households have been verified, filled out by the wards, and submitted to the administration. It is said that the relief flour will be distributed according to procedure as soon as it is allocated by the relief branch. Furthermore, it is reported that the cooperative in this district has been actively promoting cooperative businesses since its establishment. Recently, a meeting of all councilors was held at the cooperative, where the development of the business was discussed.</p>

<h3>"Bankruptcy Wave" Strikes Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 10th</p>
<p>After the victory, the complexity of the receiving institutions caused unrest among domestic industrial and commercial enterprises. Unexpectedly, internal warfare erupted repeatedly, pushing these fragile industries and businesses into a difficult predicament. Now, we have reached the most dangerous eve. In all the major cities of the country, there are constant sounds of businesses and firms closing down, creating fear and trepidation. It is clear that we are on the verge of industrial and commercial collapse. If no rescue measures are taken, it is almost certain that we will wither away!</p>
<p>Bankruptcy Spreads Across All Industries</p>
<p>Hangzhou was originally a city known for exporting special products such as silk, tea, and tung oil. In previous years, it not only made Zhejiang wealthy through the export of these products, but also earned much honor in the international market. However, the post-war export of special products has become an extremely serious problem. There are substitutes or similar products in foreign markets. Domestic markets are plagued by chaos. In addition, currency depreciation, high costs, dumping of foreign goods, heavy profit-seeking exploitation, and heavy taxes have put special products in a difficult situation. Consequently, businesses and firms have gone from barely surviving to being unable to survive, and from being unable to survive to closing down and collapsing. The number is indeed considerable. This wave of bankruptcy has spread to every industry, especially tea firms. In the span of 36 days, 28 firms had already declared closure. Although there are no precise statistics on the closure of other shops and firms, there were 24 business entities in October that had already applied to the municipal government for registration and closure procedures. These included five cloth businesses, five entertainment businesses, one grain business, one electrical machinery and silk weaving business, two laundry and dyeing businesses, one silk business, eight native paper businesses, one general merchandise business, one preserved meat business, one native tobacco business, one timber rafting business, and one cotton weaving business. If the severity of the situation is expressed in monetary terms, it will exceed 200 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Reasons for Tea Firm Closures</p>
<p>According to those in the tea business, the reason for the closures of tea firms is the government's levying of commodity taxes on tea. During the peak years, Zhejiang province levied a special product tax on tea. Later, the provincial government abolished the special product tax in an attempt to revive the tea industry. However, the Commodity Tax Bureau started levying commodity taxes again. Since there was no way to export tea and the situation was already very difficult, businesses could not bear the tax and closed down one after another. Another reason is the exploitation by usurious loans. Tea business owners who used high-interest loans to run a tea business with low profits naturally found it difficult. Conversely, if the capital used to run the tea business was used for high-interest loans, they would have much less to worry about. Therefore, the tea industry fears that it will not be able to restore its former prosperity in the short term. The result of the tea firm closures is that tea farmers will have fewer outlets for their tea, and tea farmers will suffer additional blows and hardships. On the other hand, nearly 100 billion yuan of capital will become idle capital, engaging in speculation in society.</p>
<p>In addition to the severe exploitation and attractive temptations of high-interest loans, which caused many businesses to close down, another reason for the closures of many businesses is the decline in social purchasing power. Civil servants cannot earn enough in a month to eat well and dress warmly, let alone have extra money to buy new things. With the bankruptcy of rural areas and factories on the verge of collapse, farmers and workers also lack the ability to purchase goods. Moreover, due to the lure of high-interest loans, even the remaining purchasing power that has been forgotten and left behind is transformed into idle capital, joining the ranks of high-interest loans. Some people who obtain wealth through high-interest loans want to accumulate more and more, while others buy some things, but they are still a minority. Therefore, in the Hangzhou market, many shops can be seen day after day with lanterns and decorations, blowing trumpets and drums, and hanging large, inexpensive banners with gold letters, holding big clearance sales from spring to summer and then to autumn and winter, but business is still far less lively than in previous years. If these big clearance sales still do not generate profits, then the only option is to close down. The number of businesses closing down in this way will continue to increase, the amount of idle capital in society will continue to accumulate, and the number of production units collapsing will continue to rise. Meanwhile, goods from foreign countries are arriving in a continuous stream, being cheap and exquisite. There is no hope of selling our Chinese products abroad again, and because of the cheapness and high quality of foreign goods and the unrest in the domestic situation, there is no hope of exporting them to various parts of our country.</p>
<p>New Aspirations of the Business Community</p>
<p>Some say that to save China's current industrial and commercial enterprises, the government and banks must provide large amounts of low-interest loans. This goal is the beautiful aspiration that the business community in Hangzhou is unanimously pursuing. However, if the government provides loans, there are serious questions about the future use of the loans. For example, when purchasing silkworm cocoons at high prices, the government sets a reasonable price, but cocoon merchants still clamor that it is not high enough. In reality, the purchase price is often less than the price set by the government. The reason for this is that the banks have loans, and the government lends money to the cocoon merchants according to the set price. The cocoon merchants use a small amount of money to buy cocoons and use the remaining money for other purposes. These purposes are likely to be lending at high interest rates. Therefore, in order to ensure that these loans are indeed used by the industrial and commercial sectors and to truly promote the revival of industry and commerce, there must be strict investigations, rigorous lending procedures, and thorough assessments after the loans are made. Some people say that if these loans are released, will the currency not inflate even more and the currency depreciate even further? I believe that as long as these loans are directly lent to production units and truly make one yuan generate the effect of one yuan, it is still possible to revive a portion of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Grandiose Old Slogans</p>
<p>In addition, we would like to put forward a grandiose old slogan that has been ineffective for decades: "Chinese people should use Chinese goods." First, we must cultivate the national psychology of loving domestic goods. I remember that before the war, in the Hongkou area of Shanghai, a Japanese child wanted to buy a box of matches. He went to a Chinese shop, and the shopkeeper told him: "We have Chinese matches, which are cheaper and better than Japanese matches. Why don't you buy a box to try?" But the child shook his head and left. He still went to a Japanese shop to buy a box of Japanese matches. This story can serve as a warning to us and can awaken us. Our industry and commerce are so fragile today, and only by doing this can we find a solution.</p>
<p>Encouraging the Export of Special Products</p>
<p>Hangzhou is a city for the transportation and sale of special products, and Zhejiang is an important area for agricultural and special products. If these many special products cannot be transported and sold to foreign countries in a short time, then everyone will collapse. Therefore, the government should invest heavily and be willing to encourage the export of special products, even at a loss. For example, the fact that nearly 28 tea firms have closed down due to the increase in commodity taxes is worth considering by the government.</p>
<p>The Need for Expert Research</p>
<p>We may also hire experts to conduct detailed research on these many special products and invent various other daily necessities, like Germany during the war, which could turn native products into substitutes for bread, and the United States after the war, which could make socks, leather shoes, and leather bags out of plastics. This can be attributed to research.</p>
<p>The wave of store and firm closures has fiercely struck Hangzhou, which relies on the transportation and sale of special products. We don't know when this strange wind will subside. We can only automatically strengthen and consolidate our houses to prevent this strange wind from blowing all our people into the ocean and being submerged by the waves.</p>
<h3>Re-education of Over Two Million Taiwanese Compatriots – Civic Training in Taiwan</h3>
<p>— He Minxian</p>
<p>Taiwan, 12th (Airmail)</p>
<p>This year's National Day, which has great historical significance, marks the first day that 2,394,685 young men and women in Taiwan began to receive "re-education" in succession. The training has now been underway for more than a month. According to the relevant authorities, this unprecedented training program, which is being conducted on such a large scale and is so universal, can be regarded as unprecedented and truly pioneering. The training motivation, goals, and the content and process of the work unfolding are as follows:</p>
<p>Understanding the Actual Situation of Our Country</p>
<p>The motivation for Taiwan Province to give these two million citizens re-education is based on the fact that Taiwan Province was under Japanese rule for 51 years. During these long years of shackles, Japan consistently implemented a policy of isolation, gradually alienating our compatriots in the province from the motherland. Now that the province has been restored for almost a year, no one can deny that it is necessary for our compatriots in the province to have a deep understanding of everything about the motherland. The greatest purpose of this event is to exercise civil rights and to improve the foundation of our local autonomy. Following the instructions of Governor Chen, adult training should be held quickly to inform them of the history, geography, and customs of our country in a simple and clear manner, so that they can understand the actual situation of our country. Therefore, the "Taiwan Provincial Civic Training Committee" was organized to be responsible for presiding over and promoting everything. Because the educational level and law-abiding habits of our compatriots in this province are higher and stronger than any other province in the mainland, as long as they have a deep understanding of everything about the motherland in the future, they will definitely make incomparably great contributions to the country and the nation!</p>
<p>Six Training Objectives</p>
<p>Its training objectives are six: (1) to strengthen understanding of the Chinese nation; (2) to deeply understand the current situation of our country; (3) to actively promote the essence of the Three Principles of the People; (4) to fully develop the virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace; (5) to comprehensively and universally promote government decrees; and (6) to train and disseminate popular knowledge.</p>
<p>Three-Tier Basic Organization</p>
<p>The basic organization for promoting this training work is divided into three levels of agencies: province, county (city) districts, and township (towns). For example, (1) at the provincial level: a Civic Training Committee is organized, composed of members from the Civil Affairs Department, the Education Department, the Propaganda Committee, and other relevant personnel, to preside over civic training affairs in the province, with Zhou Yi'e, director of the Civil Affairs Department, as the chairman; (2) at the county and city levels: committees are also established, with the county mayor or city mayor as the chairman; (3) at the district and township (town) levels: the district chief or township head is appointed as the supervisor.</p>
<p>Two Training Methods</p>
<p>As for the training methods, they are divided into classroom-style training, namely the establishment of "Civic Training Lecture Halls," and universal and extensive training, namely "Social Civic Training." (A) Civic Training Lecture Halls—lecture halls are established in each village, using local schools, churches, Sun Yat-sen Halls, and other public places as venues (if there is a shortage of teachers, lecture halls may be set up jointly by two to three villages; in the first phase, one man or woman aged 20 to 30 is designated to participate from each household; if the venue permits and there is no difficulty in finding teachers, two classes for men and women may be set up separately; the training period for each phase is set at one month, two hours per day, with the time arranged so as not to interfere with their work); (B) Social Civic Training—local cinemas and theaters are used as venues for implementing social civic training; for 30 minutes before each screening, slides are shown and lectures are given, or other methods are used to arouse their interest; at the same time, a 30-minute civic training course is broadcast on the radio station every day.</p>
<p>Eight Training Subjects</p>
<p>The subjects of the civic training lecture hall are divided into two major categories: political and sinicization. The former includes the promotion of government decrees and the exercise of the four powers, while the latter includes understanding history and geography and inculcating party spirit. The detailed content includes twelve items: (1) Mandarin Chinese, (2) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, (3) President's speeches, (4) New Life Movement, (5) History and Geography, (6) Essentials of Local Autonomy, (7) Summary of Provincial Administration, (8) Current Events Commentary, (9) Legal Explanations, (10) Physical Education, (11) Music, and (12) Others. Judging from the content of the above materials, they are the minimum that a citizen must know. If everyone can be well-trained, they will definitely gain a lot by the end of the period. Currently, the committee has compiled and printed 100,000 copies of these textbooks and is responsible for distributing them to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Local Teachers</p>
<p>Due to limited funding and the difficulty of recruiting teachers, the teachers for each subject in the civic training lecture hall are all recruited locally. The committee in each county and city hires local primary and secondary school teachers, administrative and autonomous personnel, party and state workers, government decree propagandists, local figures, and others with expertise in the training subjects. As for the personnel for social civic training broadcasts or lectures, the provincial, county, and city civic training committees hire those with knowledge and teaching experience. All of the above personnel are unpaid and only receive spiritual encouragement to assist in the development of public communication work.</p>
<p>Clear Assessment and Rewards and Punishments</p>
<p>In order to understand the implementation situation in each county and city, prepare for the reference for the second phase of the plan to begin next year, and ensure that this training does not waste time, manpower, and resources and can achieve satisfactory results, the committee sends inspectors to all 17 counties and cities in the province. It is expected that after this inspection, many valuable opinions will be contributed, and we will be able to better understand the actual truth of this training work. As for rewards and punishments, they are divided into three aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Include civic training work as part of the year-end performance evaluation of the county mayors and city mayors, district chiefs, and township heads who are responsible for presiding over each county and city, district office, or township.</p>
<p>(2) Citizens receiving training who are absent without reason, violate the rules of the lecture hall, or engage in other improper behavior will be warned or have their names posted in public, and will be punished with labor service (public service) for one to two days, depending on the severity of the circumstances (and they will still be forced to attend training after receiving the aforementioned punishment). If the circumstances are serious, they may be handed over to the local police authorities for severe punishment in accordance with the regulations on punishing violations of public order. Citizens receiving training who are of good character, abide by the rules, and achieve excellent test results will also be commended.</p>
<p>(3) Part-time teachers who serve diligently, teach hard, and achieve excellent results will be commended and given merit, and this will be included in the year-end performance evaluation of their original service organization.</p>
<p>Progress is Orderly</p>
<p>The civic training subjects have been described above. As for the content and materials, they are entirely aimed at citizens with a primary school graduation level. The writing and examples strive to be simple and clear. At the same time, teachers of each subject can supplement the content at any time. The progress is gradual and orderly. Each week, each unit. For example, the "Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Teachings" course is listed in the first week, and the six days are arranged as follows: on the first day, first talk about Dr. Sun Yat-sen's brief biography; on the second, third, fourth, and fifth days, continue to buy the Three Principles of the People, including the nation, the people's rights, and the people's livelihood; on the fifth day, focus on the psychological construction in the National Construction Program; on the sixth day, continue to talk about the political construction of the industrial plan and the founding of the country; the other seven weeks are devoted to the words and deeds of the martyrs, the New Life Movement, and local autonomy, and each subject is also distributed as evenly as above, in an orderly manner, so that the trainees can obtain a complete concept of each problem.</p>
<p>Hope for Joint Efforts</p>
<p>This civic training held by Taiwan Province is very important to the psychological construction of compatriots in the province. To build a new Taiwan based on the Three Principles of the People, we must pay more attention to their psychological construction. However, this arduous task requires the joint efforts of the government and the people. Citizens are the masters of the country. If they lack even the minimum intelligence and ability that a citizen should have, it greatly reduces the power to build the country. Here, I hope that the people in every corner of Taiwan will jointly assist the local government to complete the great plan of implementing civic training this time. Everyone should embrace the spirit of "those who know first awaken those who know later" and "those who are aware awaken those who are later aware" and give them practical help at all times in order to achieve brilliant results.</p>

<h3>Xinjiang Perspective (4)</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by the Newspaper Editorial Office</p>
<p>If Chairman Zhang Zhizhong wishes to regain the confidence of the native peoples of Xinjiang Province, he must overcome two significant difficulties. First, he must obtain economic assistance from Nanjing to alleviate Xinjiang's declining economic situation, especially prioritizing the construction of roads to improve transportation. Second, he must eliminate the pervasive communist propaganda. Undoubtedly, the Soviet Union is exceptionally concerned about the political future of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>General Zhang Zhizhong, in order to restore prosperity and stability to Xinjiang, has specially hired ten of China's most progressive engineers to come to Dihua to develop plans for the city's development under Zhang's guidance.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang urgently needs a team of well-trained and physically strong soldiers capable of enduring the harsh climates of the mountains and deserts to replace the current untrained recruits stationed at key locations throughout Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Medical Overview</p>
<p>Due to a lack of medicine, doctors, and hospitals, the public health situation in Xinjiang Province is extremely poor. Provincial officials state that unless relief measures are taken before the depth of winter, they fear that epidemics of typhus and cholera will cause utter devastation among the native Turkic Muslim population. In reality, while these two Asian epidemics are currently relatively mild, the diseases with rapidly increasing mortality rates in Xinjiang are smallpox, dysentery, malaria, syphilis, and typhoid fever.</p>
<p>According to estimates by health authorities, the infant mortality rate in Xinjiang Province exceeds 70%, largely due to smallpox and dysentery.</p>
<p>A severe typhus epidemic is spreading in the mountain pastures around Dihua. Unless serum and DDT and other preventative agents are rushed here from eastern China, the epidemic may soon spread to Dihua.</p>
<p>Dihua, with a population of 100,000, has only two hospitals: a general hospital with 400 beds and a mental hospital with 40 beds, both with extremely rudimentary equipment. The entire Xinjiang Province has a total of ten hospitals with 1,100 beds. The province's population is estimated by the government to be four million, while the Turkic Muslim population claims to be over seven million, but this vast population receives very little medical assistance.</p>
<p>According to health authorities, only three tons of medicine have been shipped to Xinjiang Province from eastern China since 1943. It is said that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) allocated medicine to Xinjiang Province two years ago, but due to a lack of transportation, this medicine remains滞留 in Kunming, Chongqing, Nanjing, and other places.</p>
<p>Xinjiang urgently implores UNRRA and the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) to rush serum, sulfur preparations, DDT, and other preventative agents to save the critical public health situation there. A single plane could carry enough medicine to avert the crisis. This gives UNRRA and CNRRA an opportunity to prove the noble value of their humanitarian work.</p>
<p>Due to the political situation created by the successful Turkic Muslim rebellion, UNRRA or CNRRA medicine should preferably be delivered directly to Turkic Muslim leaders, without accompaniment by American or Chinese officials, otherwise the Turkic Muslims will refuse to accept it.</p>
<p>The Manas River is the military boundary separating China from the newly occupied area controlled by the rebels. It symbolizes the arduous tasks of political and economic construction that China faces. The "Great Western Bridge" over the Manas River, before it was washed away by floods in June of this year, was the only highway bridge in Xinjiang Province connecting the desert and mountainous interior with the fertile northwest border region. Now, only the hollowed-out remnants of the two adobe bridge piers stand facing each other on the banks of the Manas River. According to a government spokesperson, the authorities are not yet prepared to rebuild the bridge. Without this bridge, it is difficult to imagine restoring friendly relations between the Nationalist government in Dihua and the rebel government in Yining. Telegraph and telephone lines between Dihua and Yining have been cut off since the Turkic Muslim rebellion from September 19, 1944, to January 19, 1946, and have not yet been reconnected.</p>
<p>During the low-water period this summer, some freight trucks carrying Soviet cloth, candy, and cigarettes were still able to ford the Manas River to reach Dihua. However, the winter storms have arrived, foreshadowing the disruption of even this limited transportation. Therefore, until next summer, the only transportation route between China and Yining will have to rely on the irregular flights of Soviet airline transport planes. China is striving to restore the territorial integrity of its largest remote province, and it seems that even geography is working against China.</p>
<p>If General Zhang Zhizhong, the Chairman of Xinjiang Province, wants to regain the confidence of the four million Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, he must restore commerce in the heart of Xinjiang. In fact, most of Xinjiang's exportable products grow in the fertile three northwestern regions: Ili, Tarbagatai, and Altay.</p>
<p>Dihua, historically an important administrative city in Xinjiang, is now striving to maintain its position as a trading post for camel caravans between northern and southern Xinjiang. Now, apart from cosmetics, cigarettes, tea, and a small amount of cloth, almost no goods are transported from mainland China. Therefore, Dihua must obtain various supplies from the rebel government in Yining. However, apart from tea, cosmetics, and cigarettes, Dihua has nothing that Yining needs.</p>
<p>Dihua urgently needs goods produced in Yining such as grains, beef, mutton, animal hides, rice, fruit, gasoline, and gold. However, even if the Manas River Bridge is rebuilt and these commodities can be transported, Dihua will ultimately not be able to compete with Kazakhstan, because the latter has good roads, an abundance of consumer goods, and machinery that the Turkic Muslims in the northwest region need but the Chinese authorities cannot provide. What Xinjiang Province urgently needs is textile factories to weave local cotton and wool into cloth.</p>
<p>When Sheng Shicai excluded Soviet industries in 1942, he purchased a modern aircraft manufacturing plant from the Soviet Union for US$4.2 million in order to convert it into a textile factory. Sheng also purchased American yarn mill machinery from a company in Shanghai for US$500,000, but this machinery has not yet been delivered. As a result, millions of native people and thousands of Chinese soldiers in Xinjiang Province are without warm clothing and are preparing to endure another bitterly cold winter. There is a surplus of cloth in nearby Soviet territory, but it cannot be obtained for the following two reasons:</p>
<p>First, the Yining government fears it will oppose</p>
<p>The transport of the cloth to Dihua.</p>
<p>Second, Since Sheng Shicai closed the western borders of Xinjiang, the Soviet Union still</p>
<p>Has not concluded any trade agreements with Xinjiang Province.</p>
<p>Unless cloth is rushed here from mainland China via a 2,000-mile desert journey within a month, millions of native people and thousands of Chinese troops in Xinjiang Province will face the risk of freezing and starvation.</p>
<p>National Defense Highway</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of defending its Central Asian border regions, China has allocated 30 billion legal tender yuan to build a military highway network to connect the vast remote province of Xinjiang with mainland China. Given that there are currently no preparations to repair the war-torn highways of the inland provinces, this lavish plan is worthy of attention. This new national defense highway trunk line stretches 1,700 li from Lanzhou in northern Gansu, across the Qinghai border, to Dihua, the capital of Xinjiang Province. The section from Lanzhou to Dulan, about 350 li, has been completed. From Dulan, it must cross a branch of the Kunlun Mountains, pass through the wilderness swamps of the Qaidam Basin, cross the snow-covered Arjin Mountains, enter the southern edge of the Taklamakan Desert, and meet the ancient caravan route in Qakilik, cross the desert to Kucha, and then quickly cross the mountain roads of the Tianshan Mountains to reach Dihua. The necessity of this arduous undertaking lies in the following fact: currently, the only connection between Xinjiang and mainland China is the ancient Silk Road from Lanzhou through the Xingxing Gorge mountain pass in eastern Xinjiang Province to Hami. This medieval highway has often been attacked by bandits in recent months, posing a danger to passing merchants, who are often attacked by guerilla bandits who frequently enter and exit the mountains on the border of Outer Mongolia. The main purpose of this Lanzhou-Dihua highway is to prevent the isolation of Dihua, a key Chinese fortress in the west, and its strategic importance is no less than the new automobile highway that the Soviet Union is currently completing outside the western border of Xinjiang. This highway is located between Stalinabad and Khorog, passing through the Pamir Mountains at an altitude of over 13,000 feet. However, the difference is that the Soviet Union uses modern road-building machinery, while China must build roads manually in the severe winter. (End)</p>

<h3>Reprinting and Translation</h3>
<p>— Traditional Prioritization</p>
<p>According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang himself in his report to the Legislative Yuan, the Sino-American Treaty allows the translation of American publications but prohibits reprinting. Some people worry that even translation is prohibited. For example, according to one interpretation, if an American work is registered or copyrighted with the Chinese authorities, then these publications should receive full protection from the Chinese government. We hope that the diplomatic authorities will clarify this point.</p>
<p>However, we also feel that the prohibition on reprinting in the Sino-American Treaty is superfluous. China is a scientifically backward country, and the number of Chinese people who can read English books is already pitifully small, and even those who can afford to buy Chinese books are not many. This restriction on reprinting does not benefit American publishers much, because the quantity that can be sold in China is very small. On the contrary, I feel that placing some pirated editions in Chinese bookstores can also have an advertising and promotional effect for the original author. Furthermore, from the perspective of Chinese readers eager to learn, this only prevents them from reading more Western books.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, if reprinting and translation were not restricted by the Sino-American Treaty, and both sides were free to reprint and translate, it would be advantageous for China, because looking at the current state of the publishing industry in China and the United States, China would gain more from American works than the United States would gain from Chinese works. However, we must realize that American businesses have gained too much from the signing of this Sino-American Treaty. The United States is a strong country, and even if it suffers a little loss in this area, it can easily compensate for it in other areas, especially since this is greatly related to the exchange of Sino-Western culture!</p>
<p>This Sino-American Treaty appears to be equal on the surface, but it is unequal in substance. I feel that the true equality and false equality distinguished by Mr. Sun Yat-sen can also be applied to this aspect. The United States is a country with a highly developed industry and commerce, while China is not. Therefore, if it is said that China and the United States can freely navigate ships, this is equal on the surface, but in reality, the United States has ships, while China has no ships to sail. Furthermore, for example, if it is said that China and the United States can freely trade, but more American goods are sold to China, and fewer Chinese goods are sold to the United States, is this not unequal?</p>
<p>Since this is the case, why is navigation and commerce open, but the reprinting of publications prohibited? Those in the Chinese publishing industry only feel that our diplomatic authorities have not considered the cultural future of China.</p>
<h3>Reading "A Teacher's Diary"</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Author: Feng Zikai Publisher: Wanguang Bookstore</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Zikai's "A Teacher's Diary" was published in Chongqing in June 1944 and reprinted in Shanghai in June of this year. A small portion of it was published in various magazines in the rear areas between 1939 and 1940. Seven years ago, I received a copy of "Cosmos Wind" from a friend in Hong Kong and read an article titled "A Teacher's Diary," which was the initial disclosure. I haven't seen it since.</p>
<p>From that initially published diary entry, I glimpsed how an artist living a peaceful life hastily bid farewell to Yuan Yuan Hall, and the arduous and embarrassed situation of leading his relatives westward. I felt deeply touched. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to see more records of his life since. Now that Mr. Feng has published his diary, I spent two evenings reading it under the lamp, with the same feelings I had when I first read that diary. My emotions seemed to rise and fall with the author's emotions, and I savored the life of this artist.</p>
<p>In literary works, generally speaking, biographies and diaries are the most moving, because both are true records of the author's own experiences. They can express the beauty of a person's personality and character. Among the two, diaries are the easiest to move people. Biographies are sometimes written by others, while diaries are all written by oneself. If we acknowledge the natural flexibility of essays in expression, we will definitely find diaries more adorable. The creation of essays is not like grand treatises, not as serious and solemn as writing "great articles." Sometimes it is based only on accidental feelings, fragmented observations, without elaborate depiction of forms and sentiments. Therefore, one feels that the emotions are lingering and the interest is endless. Generally, writing comes from innate nature, and what is inspired by the brilliance of the soul and what is revealed by practical experience must be more realistic and without falsehoods, natural and without artificiality. According to this, diaries are more in line with the conditions of natural expression. The diaries of various masters in the late Ming and Qing dynasties are still recited by people, and there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>Like Mr. Zikai's diary, although it is only a thin 160-odd pages, we can see the epitome of his wartime life and understand his daily lifestyle. His heart is completely immersed in art. Even in the most difficult and disappointing situations, he still has a warm heart full of hope. We all know the depth of Mr. Zikai's artistic talent. Artists have a sensitivity that transcends ordinary people. They can truly understand and observe everything in the world, and return it to its original appearance, without being blinded by various external temptations and prejudices. Therefore, they can shorten the distance between people and achieve the leisurely state of "observing all things in stillness and finding self-satisfaction." The reason why mankind has hatred, suspicion, and jealousy is really because the boundaries between people have not been broken. The "self-image" and "self-attachment" mentioned in Buddhism are indeed the source of stinginess and greed. After reading "A Teacher's Diary," we will definitely be able to appreciate how lofty and precious the mind of a generous artist is.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this book "A Teacher's Diary" records the life of a teacher, including the author's entire life after going west to teach at Guilin Art School. After leaving Guilin Art School, he continued to teach at Zhejiang University, and a part of it can also be seen in the diary. The author taught at Guilin Art School and Zhejiang University, and completely adopted the method of inspiration rather than emphasis on inculcation in teaching methods. What he was responsible for was the art department. He did not focus on imitation and copying, but on stimulating students' creative spirit and improving students' appreciation ability. What was especially emphasized was to connect art with real life. The author believes that in order to achieve the purpose of art education, the entire life must be permeated with artistic elements, so as to realize "the artisticization of life" and "the life-artification". Indeed, art cannot be isolated. Art that is separated from real life cannot be called art. The author also wants us to open up a limit outside the intellectual and practical boundaries, then "all things in the world are new, and beauty is everywhere." How can this realm be appreciated by those who are busy with fame and fortune and enslaved by material desires?</p>
<p>After reading "A Teacher's Diary," we can know that Mr. Feng is not only an artist, but also an ideal educator. His diary is full of love for young people. In addition to paying attention to teaching materials and methods, teachers also need to have a loving heart. If teachers cannot sincerely love students, and cannot use ardent love to nourish students' minds, they will definitely not achieve the effect of education. Mr. Feng's words and deeds to his students often revealed deep love in individual conversations and accidental contacts. He is worthy of being a "teacher," using his personality to influence his students. That kind of care and concern, just like treating his own children, can be said to be completely from the heart and without any affectation, especially in the details. I think the author was influenced by Mr. Li Shutong (i.e., Master Hongyi) and Mr. Xia Mianzun, because both of them were Mr. Feng's teachers, and he had been influenced by their personalities.</p>
<p>The diary writes the most about the wartime scene, with records of heroic deeds, exposure of the enemy's atrocities, inspiring words, and deep feelings in the heart. Although sometimes inevitable indignation, inevitable sigh, but always no disappointment, no decadence. He firmly believes that China's War of Resistance will be victorious, because he saw thousands of young people becoming fearful in the War of Resistance, and thousands of descendants of the Yellow Emperor were fighting the enemy with their blood and flesh in the torrent of the war against aggression. His optimistic spirit towards the War of Resistance is as respectable as his tireless teaching spirit. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, perhaps his words seem meaningless, but in fact, it was very difficult for him to insist on the belief that victory was certain at that time. Especially after each setback and damage (such as the bombing of Guilin), he did not show any decadence or disappointment. Talking about the hardships of wartime life, he always said "misfortune is a blessing," in fact, this War of Resistance gave the mountainous country a chance for new life.</p>
<p>In this diary, between the lines is also overflowing with a strong human touch. At a glance, we know that the author's artistic accomplishment is deep. Even a small thing in life can be given an artistic observation. Trivial things around become a valuable source of life, and accidental small talks can set off endless deep meanings. A kind of amiable style of benevolence is the fusion of Confucian and Taoist thought, which is deeply artistic and expressed.</p>
<p>There are also many descriptions of exchanges with writers. The most mentioned in the diary are Chuan Binran, Bing Xin, Song Yunbin, Tang Xianzhi, Xia Mianzun, and Hongyi Master. His wife, Li Min, and his children, Chen Bao, Yu Zhan, Ci Ying, Yi Yin, and the newborn Xin Mei, are often mentioned in the diary. The harmonious atmosphere in the family did indeed nourish the author's lonely heart during the escape. Family chats and laughter, which ordinary people find meaningless, become vivid and moving descriptions in Mr. Zikai's pen. If he were not an artist with unique insights, who would have tasted the beauty of life and enjoyed the joy of being with family and children in the tense life during the war?</p>
<p>The conversations of village women and the songs of herdsmen and woodcutters fully express the nature and simplicity of agricultural society; and the author's life is immersed in these elements. At the same time, the author also understands the true meaning of the philosophy of life. He has a vitality of life, which is full of his thoughts, so what he says, even if it is very plain, can also give people a timeless and fresh feeling.</p>
<p>Anyone who has read Mr. Zikai's "Yuan Yuan Hall Essays" and "Yuan Yuan Hall Re-Essays" will definitely understand his attitude towards life. We always feel that his prose has a simple and distant artistic conception. He sees everything in the universe as beautiful, and he feels that everything is worthy of people's appreciation and taste. In his diary, we can also see this attitude towards life. Also, his writing is relaxed and lively, without any traces of carving. This is not so much the nature of his writing as the frankness of his character. Recently, he has a collection of essays published, titled "Frank Collection". I think the reason why Mr. Zikai's life is so desirable is because of his frankness.</p>
<p>Because his life is natural and frank, his diary contains a strong sense of humor, both serious and humorous, and can be quite fascinating. His writing does not have unique and wonderful points, but it can show unique and wonderful in the ordinary. He has already achieved the integration of truth into simplicity, the integration of world affairs into satire, and the ability to find pure and beautiful charm in blandness. Perhaps this is the reason why Mr. Zikai's diary can arouse the love of most people?</p>
<p>Mr. Zikai's comics have created a unique style. The advantages lie in the clear lines and realistic expression. I think his diary also has this characteristic.</p>
<h3>A General Theory of Chinese Historiography</h3>
<p>— Yue Mu</p>
<p>Author: Zhu Xizu Publisher: Independent Publishing House</p>
<p>A general outline of the development of various systems in Chinese historiography is essential knowledge for every friend who loves history. The general youth must understand the development process of history, but also pay attention to the development of historiography. Because the records of history are not necessarily all reliable. Throughout history, most are the "official histories" of the royal family chronicles, and the records inevitably contain inaccuracies. Understanding the development of historiography can help distinguish between truth and falsehood. This can provide a lot of help in reading history.</p>
<p>This book, "A General Theory of Chinese Historiography," is the author's lecture notes from the Department of History at Peking University. Edited by his son-in-law Luo Xianglin, it provides us with a concise and essential overview of Chinese historiography. From it, we can gain insight into the development process of Chinese historiography throughout history.</p>
<p>First, the author discusses the origin of Chinese historiography. The original meaning of the character "史" (shi, history): "Shuowen Jiezi" explains: "史 (shi) records events, follows the '又' (you, hand) holding the '中' (zhong, middle), meaning upright." The author provides a brief explanation with literary examples. Then, it discusses: history based on written records, history of scribes, pseudo-historical accounts, and history inferred from ancient artifacts without written records. The author elaborates on the advantages and disadvantages of these various historical systems from the old era that were not called history. At that time, "history" was merely the not-very-accurate "official history" from the hands of scribes, which gradually developed and nurtured the seeds of history.</p>
<p>Regarding the schools of Chinese historiography, the author discusses six schools—from the Spring and Autumn period to the present day. These six schools are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Annals: distinguished by time, also known as chronological history. This type of history began after the Western Zhou Dynasty. The eras before the Western Zhou are unknown, so this type of system does not exist. Common examples of this type of history include comprehensive works like "Zizhi Tongjian" and individual works like "Spring and Autumn Annals."</p>
<p>(2) National History: distinguished by place, also known as local history. It compiles the histories of various ancient states for observation. Ancient countries, both large and small, should not be omitted. Comprehensive examples include "Records of the Three Kingdoms," and individual examples include "Chronicles of Huayang."</p>
<p>(3) Biography: distinguished by people. Within these, "one can glimpse the level of civilization and barbarity of the place, as well as the gains and losses of society." Common examples include "Biographies of Women" and "Unofficial Biography of Dongfang Shuo."</p>
<p>(4) Political History and Cultural History: distinguished by category. Political history includes economic history, legal history, military and political history, party history, and diplomatic history. Cultural history includes academics, religion, literature, art, agriculture, industry, commerce, customs, and other items. Examples of the former include "Comprehensive Statutes" and "General Examination of Documents," "Tang Code." Examples of the latter include "Separate Records," "Seven Epitomes," "Song and Yuan Academic Cases," and "Poetry Criticism," etc.</p>
<p>(5) Official History: The so-called official history is not written by one person at one time, but rather a "official history" accumulated over generations, such as the Twenty-Four Histories.</p>
<p>(6) Veritable Records: recording the cause and effect of an event, this system was created by Yuan Shu of the Song Dynasty. Examples include "Veritable Records of Zizhi Tongjian," "Veritable Records of the Three Feudatories," and "Veritable Records of Western Xia," etc.</p>
<p>I have only listed the main points of the six categories above. The book elaborates on them in detail in separate sections.</p>
<p>Two appendices are included. One explains "The Interpretation of the Grand Historian," elaborating on Sima Qian's historiography. It is best to refer to Jian Bozan's "Historical Materials and Historiography," specifically the article "Sima Qian's Historiography," for more detailed understanding. The other is a study of the chronicles of the twelve generations of the Han Dynasty, from the chronicles of Emperor Gaozu of Han, through Emperors Hui, Gao, Wen, Jing, Wu, Zhao, Xuan, Yuan, Cheng, Ai, to Emperor Ping. The author provides descriptions and tables for these twelve generations of chronicles, presenting them more clearly.</p>
<p>Although the book is concise, its content can be considered extensive. Young friends who are beginning to study history can use it as a good reference material. Although omissions may be found, it can still serve as a reference for general beginners at this time. The book also points out many errors in historiography.</p>
<p>Today, everyone knows that history is an important discipline in the social sciences. It cannot be ignored by every young person. Before reading history, we must first understand the various departments of Chinese historiography, which will greatly facilitate our reading of history.</p>
<p>This book can serve as a preparation before reading history, or as a reference after studying history.</p>
<h3>The Devil's Pool</h3>
<p>— Xu Peiji</p>
<p>Behind the simple and candid narrative lies a refined and elegant sentiment; this is a unique style of pastoral novels. Comparing the scenery of the natural world is like a small stream formed by the confluence of mountain springs. Although it is a faint trickle, the sound of water still echoes intermittently between the winding banks, with unfinished pure charm. In the crystal-clear riverbed, the gently undulating ripples on the water surface clearly show the potential of life, constantly leaping there. "The Devil's Pool" by George Sand depicts a simple and unadorned story from the French countryside. After being accustomed to magnificent and heroic works that reflect the times, it is like taking a refreshing drink in the scorching heat; it is also like the early autumn, bathing in the silky warmth of the morning sun in the slightly chilly breeze.</p>
<p>Ah! The unfolding of the story is as simple, straightforward, and unadorned as a farmer guiding his ox to plow a furrow. This furrow, on the vast wilderness, may soon be submerged by a second furrow, but the author's vivid and skillful narrative will forever preserve a deep imprint in the garden of life.</p>
<p>Look, the archetype of a country old farmer a hundred years ago – the rational Old Father Moreau – he persuades his son-in-law, hides his sorrow of losing his beloved daughter, and unselfishly advises his young son-in-law to remarry. But the young and handsome Jeunet, the honest protagonist in the book, uses his full passion to cherish his deceased beloved wife. In front of his lively young children, he is a considerate and loving father. In the village of Barre, his sincerity is loved by all the residents, and when the actions of little Marie have him in thrall, he is as ignorant as a child. But this ignorance, in some circumstances, can prompt his brave determination. When he stepped into the house of the widow Guillet, whom his father-in-law, Old Father Moreau, directed him to marry, he immediately discerned the different natures of exaggeration and glory. He cleverly withdrew from the hypocritical trap. The author doesn't directly describe the face of the innocent and intelligent little Marie, but only reflects her response from the depths of her soul through her words and actions. Her honesty and purity, compared with the pretentious behavior of the widow Guillet, the difference between them is so distant. Gentle, clever, the daughter of nature; she touched Jeunet who was approaching his thirties, she won the affection of Old Father Moreau, and she caressed Jeunet's son – little Pierre, who was not yet seven years old. In her eyes, there is no difference between the "love" she receives from others and the "love" she gives to others. But those who receive her "love" clearly feel that they have different weights! At the end of the story, Jeunet, with a nearly despairing mood, walks into the house of Mother Guillet – little Marie's mother – to seek the final decision of "love" from little Marie, she couldn't help but shout: "Didn't you feel that I loved you before?" Ah! The reader's heart will also be touched by her straightforward shout. It is not difficult for us to imagine what a delightful comedy will follow.</p>
<p>In the course of the story, the author applies her skillful technique to interweave little Pierre's charming language into the important joints of the whole book, which is exceptionally appropriate and flavorful. She also portrays the evil of the owner of Ormeau. When he bullies little Marie and Jeunet's way of punishing him is to drag him off his horse and press him to the ground; from the author's compassionate heart, one can see the author's view of life, and attitude towards art.</p>
<p>"A faithful depiction of the society in which an artist lives is a painful irony. He focuses on sin and suffering; but what do we artists of later generations depict? We will wait for the reward that anticipates death, which is the reward of mankind today. Will we pray for it to be the punishment for evil and the compensation for disaster?"</p>
<p>In Europe during George Sand's time, most art workers were accustomed to exposing the dark side of society, and accustomed to injecting somber satire into their works. Dürer, Michelangelo, Holbein, Callot, and Goya have strongly satirized the crimes of their countries, and their immortal works are historical documents of positive value. We will not deny artists the right to explore and expose social scars; but is exposure the only function of art?</p>
<p>Based on her true heart, the author recognized these vulgar and cruel views. She believes that the mission of art is a mission of emotion and love, and that artists should shoulder a major poetic task – "We would rather take mild and gentle characters that can be converted than terrifying villains that evoke terror, because terror will never correct selfishness, but only increase it." After affirming her artistic viewpoint, she also issued a hymn of "life" – a view of life and the universe.</p>
<p>"We should pay attention to life, not death. We no longer trust the empty of…to live richly, we must appreciate life. Lazarus should leave his dung heap so that people no longer need to rejoice at the death of the rich. Everyone should promote happiness, so that the fortune of a few does not become a sin and sorrow…We can no longer see death as the punishment for prosperity, or the comfort of disaster…We will no longer allow any graves to be the only escape for those whom we do not wish to make happy.</p>
<p>Using her correct thinking to measure the negative attitude held by the average person in today's society, the key to happiness that they abandon is so regrettable.</p>
<p>Writing to this point, we then close the book and meditate on the voices and smiles of the characters in the book, the lively and moving breath, containing a pure, fragrant and lasting flavor like olives. The end of the story is as bright as the afterglow after the wind.</p>

<h3>My Recent Life and Writing</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>It was on the afternoon of the seventeenth of this month, at the Literary Tea Party, that, on a whim, I proposed this topic and asked the friends who came to participate to write a little about their personal trivia. The intention was nothing more than to give readers a deeper understanding of the writer, and to add some interest to the publication.</p>
<p>I am grateful that the friends who participated that day did not take offense at my method of "assigned writing, submitting the paper on the spot." Everyone put aside their teacups and wrote it down in one go. A total of thirty-eight pieces were received at that time, and there were others who accepted the topic and were scheduled to submit their manuscripts later.</p>
<p>Now, in order of receipt, I will first publish the ten copies that have been organized. However, due to the limitation of space, the rest, together with the ones received successively, will be prepared for publication within the next week. I hope the friends will forgive me. —— Editor</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Writing about the Tea Party</p>
<p>The tea is still bitter, and it will always have a bitter taste. It is precisely because of this bitterness that we cannot forget it. Talking in the bitter taste feels so delicious. What's more, the objects of conversation are all like-minded people who know the bitter taste, so they do not hesitate to talk more and do not distinguish the bitterness of the tea.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>My recent life is nothing more than teaching, editing, and writing. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I teach "Selected Songs," "History of Chinese Novels," and "Chinese Composition" in the Chinese Literature Department of Fudan University in Jiangwan. On Tuesday afternoons, I teach "History of Chinese Drama" at the Municipal Experimental Drama School.</p>
<p>I am the editor-in-chief of Beixin Bookstore, editing the monthly magazine "Youth World." This publication has a history of more than ten years and is a comprehensive publication targeting middle school and university students. The pre-war sales volume reached tens of thousands of copies. It is currently publishing the third issue of the new second volume. In addition, I publish the "Popular Literature" weekly in Da Wan Bao every Tuesday, and the "Folk Literature" weekly in the Central Daily News every Thursday. Mr. Dai Wangshu and Mr. Ye Dejun, who write for the Spring and Autumn section of this newspaper, are the main contributors to these two publications. Researching Chinese novels and dramas has almost become my obsession.</p>
<p>Because life is busy and there is no complete time, I cannot write a systematic and complete work, but only write scattered manuscripts for various publications. However, I suffer from having to cope with it, and I feel that there is nothing to say. Most of what I write is textual research on novels and dramas, and occasionally I also write some feelings about reading and watching dramas. All publications hope that I will write about literary anecdotes and reminiscences of the past, but I have already published "Literary Silhouettes" and "Literary Impressions." Although I have met many newly acquainted writers, I have no deep friendship with them. The biggest regret is that I have no time to read each writer's works in detail, so what I write with difficulty is not profound. I think writing this kind of article is the most ancient thing.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>I am afraid that I will not be able to write articles if I am not full.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Mr. Jinshan's request for manuscripts was too great. As soon as I sat down, before I even talked to him, he gave me a topic to submit the paper. This is the way to test new students. It's a bit overwhelming. Fortunately, there is no limit to the number of words and no limit to the style of writing, so I will "take the exam" once.</p>
<p>I came from Hankou this time and passed through Shanghai to Beiping. Since the sixth of this month, I have been living a life of travel, so I am very unstable. But being able to meet friends whom I haven't met for more than ten or even twenty years is a very happy thing!</p>
<p>As for writing, I am very ashamed. The "Victory Travelogue" that I planned to write has just begun. After I settle down in Beiping, I plan to finish writing the two long novels "Great Fire Woman" and "In the Flames of War." In addition, I want to read more books.</p>
<p>I have been away from Shanghai for more than nine years. I am so happy to be able to meet many old friends today. I need to talk, so I will stop writing here.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>Recently, I returned to my hometown, which I had not returned to for ten years. After returning to Shanghai, I originally wanted to write some essays or the like to send to Jinshan. Coincidentally, the Wu Bao was published, and the editor asked me to continue writing "Wawa Diary." So I changed my plan, but after writing a few paragraphs, Wawa was spoiled and refused to write. Coincidentally, Bing Xin came from Hankou. She was going to Beiping to edit the monthly magazine "Literature and Life," and asked me for "literary works." I thought I would give her this unfinished Wawa Diary, but Wawa was too young, and I was afraid that she would not be able to withstand the hardships of the journey. Moreover, the season has already entered winter, and Beiping is terribly cold, and I am even more afraid that my Wawa will not be able to bear it; I have to think of another way.</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>Speaking of my life, it is really insignificant. I remember when I was studying at school in the 20s, I read the debate on the scientific outlook on life, in which Mr. Wu Zhihui's outlook on life was "eating, having sons, and entertaining friends." In the past twenty years, my life has been nothing more than these three items. In my recent life, except for the second item, which I am not prepared to expand, the third item has always been consistent. Every time I decide to participate in a literary tea party, it is nothing more than wanting to greet more friends.</p>
<p>Speaking of writing, I am very ashamed. I am busy with eating every day, working as a lawyer on the one hand and doing business on the other. I really don't write often. If the editor asks me to write an article, of course I will not refuse.</p>
<p>Seven</p>
<p>Recently, in addition to handling fixed routine official duties every day, I also serve as a special writer for two or three publications during my spare time, so I am busy all day long. Dancing halls have no place for me, and at most I just watch a movie. I don't drink alcohol or smoke, and this has been the case for more than thirty years. In addition to writing, reading and reading newspapers are also daily necessities.</p>
<p>Eight</p>
<p>I am now busy teaching at three schools: Shanghai Merchant Marine College, Chengming, and Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, rushing to meet the time, and squeezing onto the tram. It can be said that "there is no time to spare"; therefore, the effort of writing is also very little. Before the summer vacation, I used to paint every day. Now I can only paint one or two paintings a week, and I can barely write one or two short articles; as for the planned revisions to the "Dictionary of Chinese Painters' Names" and the compilation of the "Collection of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties," they cannot be carried out, and I can only wait until life is a little more relaxed to work on them.</p>
<p>Nine</p>
<p>Life is monotonous, but there are poems to prove it:</p>
<p>"Everything seen must be recorded, everything heard must be written, the four seasons have no leave, when will it rest? Long gatherings instead teach estrangement of friendship, but on the eve of parting, I compose farewell sorrows!" (Part 1)</p>
<p>"Spring flowers and autumn moons pass by indifferently, snails' horns and roc's wings are all caught in the net, but I hate that the pen has been bald for a long time, what can I do with deleting poetry, books, and history!" (Part 2)</p>
<p>"As graceful as a startled swan, as lofty as a dragon, floating clouds and world affairs are the same in the nine provinces, please enter the urn, don't laugh at me, I am also confused in the painting." (Part 3)</p>
<p>Ten</p>
<p>Before the war, I lived a life of chalk dust, but I was trapped in Jiangnan and joined the guerrilla work, enduring a lot of wind and frost. After the victory, it was the first time to work as a civil servant. Perhaps it was a fluke that the job was very easy. So I openly carried out reading and writing work at my desk. After Xiao Qian returned to China, he presided over the literary editing of Ta Kung Pao and asked me to write regular book reviews for "Literature and Art." Living in an unsettled place and with a turbulent life, it is inconvenient to collect many reference books, and it is not easy to search for them. I know that I cannot provide many examples in my writing; writing a book review cannot discuss the entire creative process of the author in detail, which makes me feel uneasy and ashamed in my heart.</p>
<p>Eleven</p>
<p>I am a current primary school teacher. Speaking of primary school education, it should be so important that those who engage in education work should dedicate all their energy and all their time to our future generations. But now is an era when things do not go as desired eight or nine times out of ten, and cultural people naturally cannot forget their passion for literature and art.</p>
<p>I am currently writing short stories, but this era often cannot complete a work as one wishes. Of course, there are many reasons for this, and the most important one is the writing environment. It is difficult to produce literary works in an atmosphere where the entire life cannot be stable.</p>
<p>Twelve</p>
<p>Speaking of life, it seems that recently it is the same as in the past, and there is no change. The week before last, I went back home and lived a relatively leisurely life, enjoying some late autumn mountains and tasting the "oily chicken" flavor of Wang Si Restaurant, which I hadn't tasted for eight years.</p>
<p>Recently, my "Four Great Painters of the Ming Dynasty" has been arranged and proofread by the world, and the Commercial Press has signed a royalty contract with me for "Research on Color Science." As a result, it has aroused my interest in writing long manuscripts again, and I am preparing to complete a 30,000-word "Concise History of Emerging Chinese Art" before the end of the year. I really want to write it from a "materialistic" point of view. This is an attempt, and I don't know if I will be able to write it.</p>
<p>Thirteen</p>
<p>This semester, I taught at Dongyi University and Suzhou Provincial Industrial College, etc. In addition to the various things in the local area, I was so busy that I had no time to read. Recently, I came to Shanghai, although I am still busy, but it is much better. I go back to Suzhou every one or two weeks, and sometimes I go to Hangzhou. In terms of life, I have added a lot of fun. Stealing leisure from busyness, I really want to read some famous works of classical literature. I don't want to write for the time being. What I want to prepare for is to write a "General History of China," but this is not a casual matter, and I don't dare to say that I will definitely start writing it now.</p>
<p>Fourteen</p>
<p>Recently, during my spare time in the bank, because I am the editor-in-chief of the local Pudong newspaper "Dong Bao," it has affected my writing time. I hope to have some time to organize the manuscripts of "Special Ethnic Groups in Guangxi" first, and then write the two books "Research on Pangu" and "Exploration of Flood Legends and the Myth of Fuxi Creating Man." As for the outlines of the two books "Southwest Collection Notes" and "Collection of Drama Criticism" have already been roughly completed. If there is a chance to publish them, I can immediately organize them and send them to press.</p>
<p>Fifteen</p>
<p>Mr. Jinshan gave me a topic and ordered me to "submit the paper on the spot!" Although my brain juice is dry, I squeeze it horizontally and vertically, but I can't squeeze out a drop. But the order to submit the paper on the spot, ah! How dare I disobey!</p>
<p>Life, in the past, maybe it was because I was a bachelor, often was, with wine, I got drunk; with money, I used it; with time, I played; making a lot of noise, how happy it was! Walking in the middle of the night, and touring the garden in the heavy rain were common occurrences. Perhaps it was the relationship of the war, but it seemed impossible for a person's character to be calm in a troubled world.</p>
<p>Recently, I have changed. To quote a literary catchphrase, I have changed my style. I'm sorry, but it's not because I have a wife. (My wife is a "rat" from Hedong, but she can't roar like a lion. She's a stupid donkey!) However, I ask myself, life should be rectified. To be persevering and to be hardworking, that requires determination.</p>
<p>So, recently, I am determined and trying to temper my life!</p>
<p>Lately, although I also want to write, I lack the childlike naivety, the spirit of hard work, and even more, the trust in myself. Apart from occasional translations, I really dare not write. I really dare not write.</p>
<p>Sixteen</p>
<p>I am a journalist. During the Anti-Japanese War, I served in the press in the rear. Because I lived in the north for a long time, I was not accustomed to the life in the southwest, and my friends in the rear gradually disappeared, and I had a feeling of living alone! So I left Jincheng on October 21 and came to Jinghu to see friends I hadn't seen for a long time. In two or three days, I will go to the old capital I haven't seen for a long time to engage in journalism.</p>
<p>Seventeen</p>
<p>For eight years, I have lingered in Shanghai, which was shrouded in demonic atmosphere. I have not acted as a traitor. All year round, I only close my doors to paint. Sometimes I write a few short poems to express my feelings. Many friends think that I am as poor as I am, and I must have starved to death. Friends who care about me often ask about my recent life. I only ask them to look at a self-written couplet in my studio. The couplet reads: "Half a day for reading, half a day for painting. Sometimes planting vegetables, sometimes planting flowers." This is a realistic description of my life, but I feel that I have achieved nothing, and I am getting old. I feel very sorry for my friends who care about me.</p>
<p>Eighteen</p>
<p>Everyone knows that running news is the freest job. It is of course enviable to develop freely without any restraints. However, entering this circle also has very nerve-wracking aspects. Every day, I chase clues, rush for time, regardless of day and night, regardless of distance, and go everywhere to drill down and visit everywhere. I live in this kind of situation every day. But I am very happy, I think it is very interesting, and my mood is happy.</p>
<p>Because I am biased towards news reports, I have become indifferent to literary writing invisibly. But it is not giving up, it is not disgust, but really, it is the lack of time. So, in addition to writing news reports and newsy features, I can say that I haven't written anything else recently.</p>
<p>Nineteen</p>
<p>Because I participated in the Anti-Japanese War, I joined the Air Force. Years of mechanical life made me feel bored. So, in order to adjust my spirit, I engaged in writing and researching words. Recently, I wrote a book called Victory Font, changed the manuscript eight times, and made a plan for a new font. It retains the characteristics of the old Chinese characters and adopts the strengths of the characters of various countries. It solves the problem of homonyms in phonetic characters and the problem of dialects. Now it is starting to be published for the discussion and guidance of the cultural world.</p>
<p>Twenty</p>
<p>Mr. Jinshan:</p>
<p>Thank you for your concern in inquiring about my "life" and "writing" situation. I'm really sorry, recently my life has been very simple. Apart from reading newspapers and magazines every day, I have simply done nothing. On the one hand, it is because of the busyness of the store, and I don't have a calm mind to write manuscripts. No! To be frank, I am not qualified enough. However, I am a lover of literature and art. Although my strength is not enough, I want to learn and dedicate my sincere heart to learning. I hope to have more guidance in the future. It would be great if a "literary writing guidance group" could be set up in the "literary tea party."</p>
<h3>Chat with Literary Artists</h3>
<p>— Lü Baihua</p>
<p>How could the beauty of culture lack gentlemen engaging in the arts, even more so, great talents; I offer a deep bow for the snow-boiling, engaging in delightful conversation, intimate and close.</p>
<p>Was it last week? Chen Chengyin invited me to the "Literary Tea Party." Originally, I wanted to see Sun Fuxi and Hualin as well. Fortunately, I also ran into Zhao Jingshen, so I wasn't lonely after all. Although this was my first time participating in the grand Literary Tea Party event, it is said that it was established fourteen years ago. But before those fourteen years, I remember often visiting Sun Fuxi's home. Back then, I was still young and deeply moved by this person who truly possessed "literature" and "art" and was also a refined recluse. His large bow tie, long hair, and gentle demeanor have been deeply imprinted on the heart of a weary traveler who has experienced many vicissitudes of life and will never fade away. At that time, he ran the "Artistic Wind" magazine. Because of the traveler's life of moving around, my time in Shanghai was very short. Aside from occasionally writing a few essays for the local supplement of your esteemed newspaper, I didn't contribute to any other publications. Soon after, I went to Nanjing, where life was relatively stable, but the daily routines and formalities entangled and overwhelmed my mind. I lived in "Sheepskin Lane," and every day I gazed at the riverbank and the sparse willows, thinking of Baili Xi's five ram skins. In this era, how could a poor scholar's worth be raised? So, whenever I had free time, I would pick up my pen and dispel my worries. The "Central Park" section of the Central Daily News, edited by Hualin, could be said to be my park for dispelling worries. "Baihua" was the pen name I adopted to commemorate my deceased mother, but the old writer Zong Baihua didn't mind. He wrote for the supplement of the Central Daily News, and it seemed we were proceeding side by side without conflict. I remember once, Hualin published my article under both my original name and pen name on the same day, gradually causing my original name to fade away, and many friends started calling me by my pen name. A short story called "Moon" from "Artistic Wind" was also sent from Nanjing at that time. My interest in writing can be said to have deepened, so even though I didn't participate in the Literary Tea Party, I formed a bond of literary friendship with its founder.</p>
<p>Now, fourteen years later, even before the Literary Tea Party has been restored in the five-story building of the Great New World, I have reconnected with friends from the Literary Tea Party; that was during the period from the end of last year to the beginning of this year. The "Literary World" monthly magazine that Wei Jinzhi and I co-edited was discontinued due to unsustainable sales. At the same time, Guo Lanxin wanted me to temporarily edit a supplement for a certain newspaper, but I left due to issues with the payment. I only taught at Zhijiang and the Law and Politics School, feeling bored. At this time, Lu Danlin was editing "The Beginning of Man" and invited me to help him. Perhaps it was a matter of resonance, we got along very well. And there was Chen Chengyin, whom I had been meeting frequently for many years, even until now. It was only through Xu Zhongnian's article that I learned that he and Lu Danlin were both mainstays of the Literary Tea Party. I am a layman when it comes to literature and art, and besides, in my middle age, filled with sorrows and joys, I can no longer muster the courage to "write at once when mounted." However, the vague past and present circumstances have unconsciously created a little warmth and some closeness towards the Literary Tea Party in me. Grasping Sun Fuxi's hand again, he said:</p>
<p>"You haven't changed a bit!"</p>
<p>This made me smile bitterly. More than ten years have passed, how could I still be the same? There were many people there that day, and Chengyin patiently introduced me to them. I thought of "The gentleman transforms like a leopard, his culture becoming brilliant." The "culture" in literature and art should be metaphysical to achieve the brilliance of virtue and accomplishment. "Engaging in the arts" is even more of an instruction from the former sages. However, the "great talents" I mentioned in my poem do not necessarily refer to "a great talent, tall and imposing." The original meaning of the word "great" is "large." Why does literature and art start with tea and not wine? I agree with this very much. Wine can lead to recklessness, while tea can purify the mind. Outside the passes, snow is flying. If we use snow water to brew tea, that would be even better. See "Classified Assemblage of Affairs":</p>
<p>"Dang Taiwei obtained snow water to brew tea and asked, 'Does the Dang family have this pleasure?' He replied, 'How would they know this? They can only drink lamb wine under gold-decorated tents.'"</p>
<p>In this way, friends of the Literary Tea Party, gathering in a "place of books and records," would not fall into clichés! This has already been explained in the few points for improvement discussed by Chen Chengyin, Hualin, and Xu Zhongnian in "Spring and Autumn" a few days ago. A little warmth and some closeness made me write such an unpresentable poem.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes from the Literary World</h3>
<p>— Zhan Weng</p>
<p>When Chen Shiyi lived in Suzhou, he was eighty years old. He usually regarded himself as the chief of the poetry world and used his age to act old and sell his seniority. Shao Tanqiu from Nanchang happened to pass through Wumen and was introduced by Jin Songcen to visit him. Chen Shiyi regarded him as a young upstart and treated him with disdain. Shao Tanqiu was furious and pointed out more than ten errors in Chen Shiyi's poems regarding the use of allusions. Chen Shiyi was stunned and unable to answer. The next day, on the Shangsi Festival, there was a ritual gathering at Black Dragon Pool in Nanjing, hosted by Cao Lianheng, Shao Yuanchong, and others, who revered Chen Shiyi as their leader. Shao Tanqiu then wrote an essay titled "The Poem Calamity," severely criticizing the shamelessness of poets mutually praising each other, leaving Chen Shiyi completely humiliated. Observers all praised Shao Tanqiu for his straightforwardness and decisiveness. Chen Shiyi suffered this great blow and began to look at Shao Tanqiu with new respect, no longer daring to act old.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 99</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Therefore, it was not easy to get through this kind of "five-level test." Even the best results required forty-eight hours. That is to say, from the first to the fifth level of testing, you had to answer satisfactorily, with no point where you lacked "logic," and at the same time, you had to endure the torture under each test. However, it was also common for some people to get through by pulling strings and getting more lenient treatment during the tests. For example, when Tsurumi Tama returned to the country this time to be tested, powerful figures had already intervened on his behalf beforehand. Because Tsurumi was a top-notch talent among the "young and vigorous faction," the association should have recruited him, so after only forty-eight hours of various procedures, everything for the "initiation ceremony" was completed at midnight that day.</p>
<p>Having passed the five-level test and successfully becoming a member of the Black Dragon Society, Tsurumi found it much easier to explore the "seven sealed letters." Although he was quite excited, he was physically exhausted and constantly thinking about the disclosure work after obtaining the "seven sealed letters," so he thought of going to Ueno Park to relax a bit, partly to restore some energy and partly to clear his thoughts in preparation for the next step of work.</p>
<p>Who knew that after just taking a few steps, he suddenly felt someone coming out from under the eaves of a house corner, following him. In the perception of ordinary people, there would of course be no response to this kind of thing. Tsurumi had something on his mind and had also undergone quite rigorous training. He himself was someone who engaged in this kind of activity, so of course it was easy for him to notice. Moreover, it was already midnight, and there were few pedestrians on the road, making it easy to distinguish whether the person was following him or just an ordinary pedestrian.</p>
<p>However, Tsurumi didn't make a big fuss when he discovered someone was following him. He just silently noted "one" in his mind. That is to say, he had discovered one person tailing him. Little did he know that just after noting one, there were as many as five more, coming out from the left and right dark corners of the street, remotely trailing at a considerable distance, following his every step. If it were only the Black Dragon Society sending people to complete the procedure and create a kind of "pledge of allegiance," that would be a trivial game to Tsurumi, and he wouldn't be flustered at all. But Tsurumi was someone who concealed heavy, even triple, secrets, so how could he be careless?</p>
<p>"Are they the spies of the Lan Group? Are they the mortal enemies of the Black Dragon Society, the Jiangchuan Restoration Society? (Most of the people in this Restoration Society were former partisans of the shogunate, and they were politically opposed to the Black Dragon Society in domestic affairs.) Or are they other newly emerging dangerous enemies in the dark?" Because at this time, the war of aggression against China was already brewing successfully. The military, political, and financial circles, those who were greedy for credit and wealth, had already established many factions, competing for profit externally and competing for power internally, or even competing for both power and profit. Each party squeezed out the others, possessing assassins who specialized in carrying out assassination work.</p>
<p>In normal times, not to mention just five or six people, Tsurumi wouldn't even put them in his eyes. Even if there were twice as many, he would have to weigh them carefully, joke with them first before talking. You have to know that Tsurumi's "judo" was nearly at the seventh dan level, making it easy to deal with ten or so people. His "kendo" had also passed the fifth dan level, and he had learned from a famous kendo master of the time, undergoing special training that allowed him to face a sword bare-handed. As for his marksmanship, in addition to receiving a special shooting skills award at the Army University, he had won the first prize at the military's suburban "Umu" group. But why did he come to Tokyo? Why did he join the Black Dragon Society? Wasn't it all to expose the secrets of the seven sealed letters of several international evil leaders?</p>

<h3>Blood Plasma</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The blood plasma trading case has become one of the fashionable topics. In fact, it is just the same as other commodities, such as automobiles, steel, aircraft materials, military blankets, and ration food boxes. What's the difference? However, because it is blood plasma, something fresh from inside the human body, everyone is paying special attention to it.</p>
<p>The U.S. Foreign Assets Disposal Committee should bear the responsibility for this incident. First, the merchants purchased it from the Disposal Committee through formal procedures, neither stealing nor smuggling. Second, the blood plasma was mixed in with many items, and no one knew about it beforehand, and the Disposal Committee never announced a ban on trading. Third, the term "black market" is not very appropriate to use here. Experts bought in bulk, added interest, freight, and losses, and wholesaled it to pharmacies, so naturally they had to raise the selling price. Pharmacies openly priced it for sale. Is this a black market? Is raising the selling price a black market?</p>
<p>Since they sold it themselves, how can they say that the buyers are violating the law? If they are violating the law, the first violators are the sellers. So, above all, they should have considered it more carefully when they originally put it up for sale.</p>
<p>Now this batch of blood plasma has been sealed up. Those engaged in this windfall trade are truly in a state of mixed emotions. They are now saying that as long as there is a reasonable price, it can all be taken back. Although there will be losses, there is nothing they can do. They hope that the host can consider this approach, otherwise, merchants will not dare to trade with the Disposal Committee in the future.</p>
<h3>A Swift, Decisive, and Delightful Original Judicial Performance: A Report from a Foreign Reporter</h3>
<p>— Liaoran</p>
<p>American journalist William Ayers once lived in the Communist "Liberated Areas" of Shandong for some time. After returning to Shanghai, he recently published several articles in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury about his memories of the "Liberated Areas." The most interesting article was the one describing how the Communists handled the case of a traitor. Because from this article, we can see how the Communist judicial organs are organized, how they exercise their powers, and what the Communist judicial concept is. The article begins by describing the peaceful tranquility of the Chinese countryside. Suddenly, the article writes: "Secretary Hu said, 'There will be a mass meeting this afternoon... We are going to execute someone.'" The matter was so sudden that the number one traitor in the area was to be tried. There was no public announcement beforehand, and no newspaper published the news. The leaders of the various small groups that were firmly organized in the Communist regime all received the following order: "Select a few people from your group to attend a meeting this afternoon." There was no preliminary hearing, in stark contrast to the International Military Tribunal's trial of war criminals from Japan and Germany.</p>
<p>Secretary Hu told me (the reporter claims) that the traitor did not have to be tried, as long as he repented and admitted his guilt. In the twenty-four hours that followed, the Communists I spoke to all unanimously believed that as long as the traitor was willing to repent, he would not have to be tried. Every time I heard this, I was shocked, because this statement had a religious tone, which contradicted the Communist materialism... The Communist Eighth Route Army's method of dealing with prisoners was to educate them through persuasion, first criticizing the other side's wrongness in conducting the war, then praising the Communist Party, and finally showing them that peace was more valuable than war for them personally. If the persuaded prisoners expressed repentance and determination to reform, they could be released; otherwise, they had to be tried. The traitor to be tried this time, a certain Wang, had undergone a year of persuasive education by the Eighth Route Army without repenting, so he was to be "tried" on August 31. Here, the word "trial" is similar in name but different in substance to the "trial" used by the International Military Tribunal to try Japanese and German war criminals. The trial that the traitor Wang underwent could actually be considered to have already taken place unofficially during that year of persuasive education. The trial I witnessed that day was merely the announcement of the verdict. There was no need to guess what the verdict would be; everyone already knew the outcome.</p>
<p>The Drama</p>
<p>"About two thousand people were sitting on the platform. The curtain was raised on the platform, and in the middle sat Judge Sun, with two judges from the 'government' on his right and three judges sent by people's organizations. On his left were Prosecutor Yu and the clerk. When the truck carrying the prisoner arrived, there was a moment of silence in the court... I was reminded of the drums of the French Revolution. The truck stopped in front of the stage, and two policemen escorted the prisoner, whose hands were cuffed behind his back... The prosecutor began his indictment... After the prosecutor finished his indictment... Judge Sun asked, 'Is the indictment fair?' The defendant replied, 'Some places are wrong, some things I didn't do.' Question: 'Do you want to summon witnesses?' Answer: 'I wouldn't dare trouble the court.' Then Judge Sun walked towards the crowd at the meeting and asked what the people's opinions were. No one spoke. 'According to the crimes committed by the defendant, he should be sentenced to death. The court has already discussed it. What are your opinions?' Judge Sun waved his fist in the air and shouted, 'Kill!' Then the crowd shouted three times, 'Kill! Kill! Kill!' Judge Sun took out the written judgment from his pocket and read it line by line..." After reading it, the defendant was shot on the spot. (See the full text in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury on November 14)</p>
<p>From the above facts, the Communist judicial concept is primitive, backward, and barbaric, and is far removed from the modern democratic judicial concept. According to the principles of democratic politics, judicial power and administrative power are separated, while Communist justice is purely an appendage of the administration. Communist justice has no so-called "principle of legality of punishment," and guilt is not necessarily punished. As long as one is willing to "repent," one can be declared innocent; if one is unwilling to repent, one must be sentenced to death. Therefore, the entire Communist justice system can be encompassed in just eight words: "Those who obey me live, those who oppose me die." Communist justice is merely a means of achieving political goals, and has no independence in itself. Therefore, as long as the political goals are achieved, the judicial means can be dispensed with, and the defendant is naturally acquitted. The judges have people's representatives, which seems to be a jury system. However, the people's representatives under the Communist Party are merely nominal. Even the "crowd" attending the meeting is selected by the "leaders of each group" according to orders from above, so the people's representatives on the jury are even more chosen by the Communist Party themselves. It is conceivable that even if they are truly elected by the people, their task is probably only to be present. If the chief judge does not shout "Kill!" they probably would not dare to shout "Kill!" first. Don't you see those "masses"? When the judge asked for their opinions, no one spoke until the judge waved his fist and shouted "Kill!" Then they followed with "Kill! Kill! Kill!" It can be seen that these jurors are used to deceive the people, and their opinions cannot affect the verdict at all. Furthermore, the judicial organs represent the state in exercising criminal punishment, and have the right to punish those who should bear criminal responsibility according to the law, without soliciting the opinions of the general public. Communist justice is not like that. On the one hand, the outcome of the judgment is already known to all, and the judge has already written the judgment and put it in his pocket; on the other hand, he pretends to ask the masses how they should be judged. Although his hypocrisy is ridiculous, this action is completely incompatible with the modern concept of justice!</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Communist justice has no system of appeals, no so-called appeals, retrials, protests, or rehearings. Once a judgment is made, it is immediately executed. Even if the judgment is improper, there is no way to remedy it. There is also no preliminary hearing, and the trial procedure is very simple. There is only prosecution, no defense. The defendant is not only physically restricted (wearing handcuffs), but also has no one knowledgeable in the law to defend him. Therefore, a case can be concluded in just a few tens of minutes, which is vastly different from the year it took for the Netherlands to try German war criminals, the half a year it has taken for Tokyo to try Japanese war criminals, and the several months it takes for the Shanghai High Court to try each case of a traitor. Modern democratic countries all recognize that the purpose of punishment is to prevent crime, and criminal proceedings adopt the principle of discovering the substantive truth. Therefore, the defendant is presumed innocent before the verdict is made, and evidence favorable or unfavorable to the defendant should be investigated, and the defendant should be given the opportunity to defend himself and the opportunity to make a final statement. The Communist Party believes that justice is the superstructure, and the purpose of punishment is only to eliminate obstacles to communism. Therefore, all so-called levels of review, defense, investigation, and preliminary hearings are naturally absent. This kind of justice is far removed from the judicial concepts of modern democratic countries, so it is said to be a primitive, backward, and barbaric judicial concept.</p>
<h3>Thinking from Photographs</h3>
<p>— Zuiyin</p>
<p>No matter how fierce a person is, when taking a photo, they always like to have a bit of a smile; even if they don't smile, they have to put on a look that gives people a good impression of them. The reason why humans are different from animals is probably because they have a little more of this.</p>
<p>So, when you look at those different faces in front of the photo studio window, you always feel that those people are like "good people," they are all "smiling," and they are all powerful and promising; no face lets its ferocious true nature appear in the lens. It is said that this is certainly a falsification of hypocrisy, but social order depends entirely on this to maintain it.</p>
<p>These words were spoken to me by someone not long ago. At that time, I only felt that the speaker had some insight. Unexpectedly, today, I feel more and more that the above in-depth and simple statement is really reasonable!</p>
<p>Look: from Göring of Germany to Zhou Fohai of China, these executioners of war and accomplices of aggressors, when they arrived in court, all spoke eloquently, talking a lot of nonsense. If we were a little naive, we would really think that this world is full of benevolent, righteous, and moral great people. Before committing suicide, Göring also tried to spread his will, saying a lot about the "future mission of the German people," etc. He was not unrepentant until death, he certainly knew that he had been acting recklessly in the past, but even though he understood it in his heart, he could not help but "sanctify" it with nonsense in his mouth, trying to make people see him as a revolutionary; furthermore, even a heinous traitor like Zhou Fohai could not help but come up with a set of blind and absurd defenses. Fortunately, compatriots in Shanghai and many other occupied areas are still alive and not too forgetful, otherwise, Zhou Fohai's "simply moving people's hearts" eloquent talks would really make us fall into a fog!</p>
<p>What I am most interested in is: since the public trial of the number one traitor Chen Gongbo, all of them, big and small, have been grandly confessing and speaking plausibly. Among them, some knew that it was difficult to escape death, but they still refused to be frank and all tacitly gave a lot of rhetoric and put on a "moralistic" appearance. This is just like: when taking a photo, even a great thief who has killed countless people will show a bit of kindness and amiability.</p>
<p>In this day and age, no one exposes their heart anymore. Everyone is acting in a foolish way! No wonder, a few years ago, a baby in Manila died after three days because his heart grew outside his chest!</p>
<h3>Private Life</h3>
<p>— Saintly</p>
<p>Starting with Xia Peizhen</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, Xia Peizhen, a female movie star second only to Hu Die, was sentenced to one year in prison after the victory due to a drug case. According to reports, she will soon be released. This news reminded me of the past of this red star who once starred in "The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple."</p>
<p>In 1932, she joined the Star Film Company and began the life of a movie star in that golden age. At that time, her income, excluding remuneration, was a monthly salary of two hundred yuan, and the price for filming one day was seventy yuan. This kind of generous treatment was beyond what ordinary people could compare to. However, she became addicted to the world's worst habit because of this. Her artistic achievements were destroyed at this point. Later, when she left the Star Film Company, she had a legal dispute with the company. For a time, she was a news figure known to women and children. However, the flood of poisonous substances gradually eroded her youth and vitality, and she became depressed. She rarely performed in the film industry. When we recall this history of the artist's fall, we also feel infinite regret! Reality is always the most ruthless! Thinking of Yuan Meiyun from Xia Peizhen, this pair of red stars with black records both committed the same problem. Their future was ruined in "one wrong step," and now there is no way to solve it!</p>
<p>The hard life of film and drama artists evokes our sympathy, but precisely because of working day and night, and having a more free lifestyle, it is easiest for their private lives to collapse. One wrong thought can lead to irremediable consequences. I am not preaching here, but as an artist, one must be able to manage oneself and restrain oneself. Otherwise, once emotions are released and unrestrained, the degeneration, corruption, and white killing and martyrdom, those sentimental behaviors, are enough to kill the individual and kill art!</p>

<p>After a while, he heard the people below shouting loudly, and he knew that he was almost at the top. He opened his eyes and saw Lu Xun standing against the wall, about ten feet away from him. Mi En felt a little dizzy, but not afraid at all, and even felt happy. He said, "Lu Xun!"</p>
<p>"It's Mi En."</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p>
<p>"I'm here to accompany you down, you don't have to worry, I will take care of you."</p>
<p>Lu Xun moved slightly, but did not turn around. He said, "I can only do that. I know people will definitely misunderstand me. But, I can't worry about so much."</p>
<p>"I climbed up so hard," Mi En said happily, "How did you get up here?"</p>
<p>Lu Xun said, "I smashed his head and then shot her. His head didn't break after all. The stick actually bounced off, and my hand hurt so much."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter," Mi En said, "Now everything is over."</p>
<p>Lu Xun suddenly raised his head and shouted in a special tone, "Mi En!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Lu Xun!"</p>
<p>Lu Xun paused for a long time, and then asked, "Do you think doing this will hurt her heart?"</p>
<p>Mi En replied, "God! She certainly won't be sad. She will never feel anything."</p>
<p>"Do you think that's for sure?" Lu Xun asked with a strange laugh.</p>
<p>"I think that's for sure."</p>
<p>"That's great. Then, let's go down now." He immediately stood up.</p>
<p>"Mi En shouted," Stop! Don't do this!" But Lu Xun took up his gun and fired at his own head. With a bang, blood splattered, and his body slowly leaned over and lay down.</p>
<p>Mi En listlessly stared at his corpse, still leaning tightly against the ladder. The people below all shouted together. He closed his eyes tightly and shouted, "It's all settled, there's no need to panic now."</p>
<p>When Mi En got into the car, the police officer handed him a letter, but he didn't have the heart to pay attention to it at all. He simply forgot about it. When he got home, he felt around in his pocket and remembered it.</p>
<p>The envelope was addressed to Dr. Mi En. Mi En looked at it and felt very sad, but it was obviously not written by Lu Xun later on. He tore open the envelope and looked at it. There were four one-pound notes and two ten-shilling notes inside.</p>
<p>He looked at it for a long time, then put it back into the envelope, put it in his pocket, and closed his eyes. He didn't sleep all night, of course he was too tired to support himself. (End)</p>
<h3>News Figure: Overseas Chinese Tycoon Aw Boon-Haw</h3>
<p>— Whirlwind</p>
<p>Aw Boon-Haw has arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Aw, the purpose of this trip is to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang in Nanjing and report on the situation of overseas Chinese. In addition, he will visit President Song and Minister Yu to seek instructions on the future development of the Fujian Economic Construction Company under Mr. Aw's leadership.</p>
<p>Some newspapers reported that Mr. Aw enjoys Peking opera and various local operas, and that he had been to the Gong Wu Stage to see a theatrical production with elaborate stage machinery. One evening newspaper ran the headline: "Aw Boon-Haw Watches 'Seven Swords and Thirteen Heroes'," which was nothing short of an unpaid advertisement for the Gong Wu Stage.</p>
<p>Thinking of Tiger Balm</p>
<p>Mentioning Aw Boon-Haw immediately brings to mind Tiger Balm, Eight Treasures Pills, and Headache Powder produced by the Tiger Balm Yong An Tang. "Tiger Balm Yong An Tang" was established by Mr. Aw single-handedly. Currently, branches have been established in Rangoon, Java, Siam, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hankou, Fuzhou, Tianjin, and other places. There are also special agents in major ports around the world. The popularity of its sales is truly remarkable. However, it is said that when Mr. Aw first started the business, he personally led his staff, dressed in colorful tiger costumes, to promote and peddle their products to various businesses. Through diligent management, he eventually rose to become a wealthy overseas merchant, which was no easy feat.</p>
<p>Mr. Aw's ancestral home is Yongding, Fujian, but he was born in Rangoon, Burma. His father took a "big-eyed chicken boat" (named so because the bow of the sailboat had two large eyes painted on it) to Rangoon fifty years before the founding of the Republic of China, established the Yong An Tang Chinese medicine shop alone, married a woman surnamed Li, and had two sons, Boon-Haw and Boon-Par.</p>
<p>Mr. Aw is known for his generosity and vigorously supports general charitable and public welfare undertakings, which cannot be compared to "charity scammers." He has initiated the establishment of middle schools in various overseas locations to provide education for overseas Chinese children, built medical facilities, and established elderly homes, benefiting overseas Chinese quite substantially. Worthy of note is Mr. Aw's concern for national affairs: during the Northern Expedition, the September 18th Incident, and the January 28th Incident, he donated large sums of money and a large quantity of medicines each time. During the Anti-Japanese War, his support for the motherland was also considerable.</p>
<p>Starting a Newspaper in Shanghai</p>
<p>Some say that Mr. Aw's visit to Shanghai this time is to prepare for the publication of a Shanghai edition of the "Star" newspaper series, to be named the "Star Shanghai Daily," which is his [illegible] business "feeling [illegible]." This move [illegible]. Aw Boon-Haw's newspaper business began in 1921 when he invested 50,000 yuan in Rangoon to establish the "Burma Morning Post." In 1928, he invested 500,000 yuan in Singapore to establish the "Singapore Daily," dominating the Singaporean newspaper industry. In 1931, he also founded the "Sin Hua Daily" in Shantou. Given the strength of Mr. Aw's capital, his newspaper business certainly has a good chance of success.</p>
<p>In Pasir Panjang, Singapore, Mr. Aw once independently opened a large-scale swimming pool with attached basketball courts, tennis courts, badminton courts, etc. A sign was posted stating "Chinese Only Allowed to Swim." Comparing this to the sign of the past in Shanghai that read "Dogs and Chinese Not Allowed," it is a reflection of changing times.</p>
<p>Mr. Aw is now sixty-four years old, but his spirit is as vigorous as ever, and it seems that he has several more ventures waiting to be completed!</p>
