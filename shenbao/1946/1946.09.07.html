<h3>清剿湖匪方策決定　組織水區剿匪部　楊彦斌率部投誠湯總司令已允準</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州六日電〕關於太湖股匪勦撫問題，自江南治安會議閉幕以來，迄今未見具體行動。茲經記者綜合各方消息，悉最高軍事當局已決定清剿方策，業經陸軍副總司令湯恩伯赴盧簽呈主席核準實施，即將組織太湖水區剿匪指揮部，派第一綏靖副司令陳大慶中將充任指揮官，地點已擇在無錫，該部經國防部授權統一指揮蘇浙皖三省各縣之軍隊及地方武力，并編訓水上快速部隊，近特由陳兼指揮官分電蘇錫虞三縣高價徵用商船，及人民私有小艇，現本縣已奉令征僱多艘，限期送交無錫指部應用。</p>

<h3>艾格頓對記者表示　願盡力為我服務　行總工作檢討會昨分七組舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕新任聯總駐華辦事處長艾格頓少將，暨即將返美之前代理處長雷氏，六日晨舉行記者招待會。艾氏對行總工作認為滿意，表示將盡最大努力，使物資運華。并稱：渠在滬時，曾至碼頭視察，認該地情形不如「相像之壤」，蓋物資抵埠後，即設法運出。艾氏以大部份時間，討論聯總物資運華與物資接濟共軍地區兩問題。關於前者，艾氏認禁運令對中國并無多大影響，因禁運令頒佈後，并非全部物資不來，且暗示禁令可望取消，此事之關鍵，繫於運輸條件。據稱：停運物資，一部份為笨重器材，一部由於運輸困難，凡收到後能立即分配者，仍續運來。關於聯想救濟計劃是否將延至明年六月底一事，艾氏認中國運輸遲緩，明年三月以前恐難辦竣，延期或有可能。外記者對於物資運赴共軍地區一事，極為關切，艾氏稱：共產黨地區物資按原定計劃運出，救濟物資之分配，並無政治限制，全視各區需要而定，而尤以交通關係為大，然亦有事實上之困難，若干物資危險而未能送到。聯總人員又於記者招待會中宣佈兩事：其一為行總共向中央銀行貸款八百萬元，聯總並未補助其經費；另一為聯總正與行政院接洽，期能收購一部份美軍剩餘物資，且作救濟之用，如此可節省運輸噸位，經事對雙方皆屬有利。</p>

<h3>陳納德與行總　將在滬簽合約</h3>

<h3>中美間的國民外交</h3>
<p>在節近中秋而鬱熱不減溽暑的時候，我們看見有美國國會議員團的訪華，及大學教授裴斐的來華遊歷講學。前者雖為美國政府中人，但國會議員來自民間，與其說是政府官員，無寧說是人民代表。他們也實在是人民的代表，並且是以人民代表的身份而來華訪問的。至於裴斐教授，則係一介書生，既不担任政府職位，純以私人資格重來中國。在國與國的關係上，這種私人的或人民間的交往，所關實至重要。只有在人民間的了解能相互增加時，纔能促成國際間的了解，增進國際間的合作。所以對於這此人民代表的來，我們表示歡迎，并願人民間的接觸能夠更加頻繁，以泯滅偏見誤會，增進國際間的了解。</p>
<p>裴斐教授以學者的姿態，對於當前政局，不為肯定的論斷。前昨本市文化界新聞界及國民外交協會先後招待，裴斐教授在茶會席上兩三指出：勸我們不可將國內局勢的國際關係估計得太高，中國問題終究是國內問題，應該自身可心覓取解決的途徑與基礎。我們讚佩這種客觀的視　，而且每個愛國的國民也均應以這種態度為態度。以國內問題而使之成為國際問題，或以國內問題而聽從國外權力的指使，實有背於民族主義的起碼要求。但所謂國內問題，也有種種性質上的不同，未能一概而論。例如東北問題應該是一個純粹的國內問題，但自始就為國際關係所籠罩—那使人不快的雅爾達，不已先決了東北的命運嗎？美議員來華，於一昨在北平聲稱：「美國對蘇態度，應轉強硬。……解決中國爭議之談判失敗，多半應歸咎於蘇方勢力。……蘇聯力圖控制全中國，已在進行中，一旦成功，吾人可準備完全退出東方。美國既關心世界和平，決不能默認此種事態。……」此一觀察的澈底，與裴斐教授的保留態度，似乎呈着饒有趣味的對照。</p>
<p>我們在此地要指出的：第一，中國以三民主義為建國的最高指導原則，在民族主義下，倘若是一個純粹國內的問題，我們堅持必須以自身的努力來尋求解決。第二，中國在世界第二次大戰中，犧牲最重，受難最久，我們知道戰爭是怎樣一件慘事；所以我們對於世界持久和平的建立，期望最殷，我們決不是一個好戰的民族，所以極不願見第三次世界大戰的爆發，使人類遭受更慘的刦禍。聲明了這兩點前提以後，我們覺得中國局勢之發展到現階段，我們固然自慚能力的不足。努力的不夠，然其間由於國際關係的推波助瀾，所在亦復不少。根本原因就在於共產黨是一個國際性的黨。中央即是共產黨人，他們與出現在別處的共產黨人就沒有意識上的分別和手段上的不同。他們以「民主」相號召，利用了民主國家的民主傳統來增進他們的地位。今日中共的猖狂，半由於民主先進國家人士對於中國國情的不了解。所以中國局勢自始即帶有一些國際關係存乎其間。等到中共的地位增強以後，就開始顯露他們的原形。中共的反美宣傳與莫斯科的反美言論，遙相呼應，若合符節，自然決不是偶發的事件。</p>
<p>人中國人民的觀點，我們敢說，凡一切隔靴搔癢，在中國境內扶植共產黨的辦法，不論其為直接的間接的，均為中國民族所不需要。中國人民需要安居樂業，和平統一，而中共卻到處擴充武力，發動戰爭，且其領袖公然宣佈有持久作戰的計劃，另組政府的企圖。所以在現階段的情勢下，我們如不問中共的欲望究竟何在，而只是一味採取綏靖姑息的政策，必致繼續過去的錯誤和失敗。我們并不反對「商談」，反之我們寗見商談的成功，但我們先得問明中共有否商談的誠意。譬如這幾天五人小組會一事，中共的出爾反爾，就是使我們不能再置信的顯著一例。在這種微妙的國際關係下，中國人民的意願，與美國是相同的，他們不希望大戰的再爆發。為使這種願望能夠滿足，他們實在應該有更緊密的携手。有人或許希望做中國的狄托，但中國人民是不肯出賣他們的祖國的。我們願請教象裴斐教授那樣權威的作家：中國問題既是中國人的內部問題，現在醫藥研究國家是否有人還想扶助出一個中國的狄托來？這違背了中國人民的願望，固不必說；同時，也違反了中國人自己解決內部問題的原則，而對於世界和平亦將是一种嚴重的威脅。這個時候所需要的，實莫於幾個大國都能有具備遠見而堅定的政策；在這個政策的形成上，更需要人民間了解的相互增進。在這個意義下，我們歡迎并願望人民間接觸的頻繁；因為惟有人民間接觸的頻繁，纔能增進人民相互的了解。</p>
<h3>由上海市總工會改選說起</h3>
<p>上海市總工會昨天舉行第五屆改選代表大會，上海全市數十萬工人，新的領導者，不，新的服務員，就從這次大會裏選了出來。勝利以後，這是上海工運工作人員第一次的檢閱，不能不說是工人運動史上的一件大事。我們首先期望這些新的工運領導者，好好的把上海全市的工人，領導到一條努力生產，建設國家，而又能改善勞工生活，提高勞工地位的大路上去。然而要領導勞工走向這條大路，不能僅僅靠工會。</p>
<p>中國不需要暴力革命的共產主義，但中國不可不實行和平革命的社會主義；而這和平革命的社會主義，在　國父的遺教裏業已指明就是民生主義。故中國的經濟問題，或社會問題，不是要不要實行暴力的共產革命的問題，而是願不願切實推行民生主義經濟政策的問題。中國國民黨的責任，國民政府的責任，在今天莫大而且也莫急於努力實行民生主義。果能在實行民生主義的大前提下，確定了我們所應採取的經濟政策，則政府對於目前大家所焦慮的勞資糾紛以及一切勞工問題，解決起來，自有方針可循，也必能游刃有餘了。戰後英國的工黨政府，至少在這一點上，可以值得我們政府的傚法。但是，我們必須知道：必先有英國這樣的工黨，才能有英國這樣的工黨政府，也必先有英國這樣的工黨，才能使英國的工會都來擁護這國的工黨政府；更進一步說，那未必須先有英國那樣的工黨領袖，纔能號召起英國全國的勞工在各種工會裏來支持工黨執行它的政策。所以勞工運動是不容許輕視的，不是隨便便可以幹的，第一要有堅信主義的黨，第二要有才德俱備的領導者，第三更要有兼具民族意識與民主素養的工會羣眾。三者備而後可望有建全的勞工運動。</p>
<p>中國國民黨對於引導中國勞工負起自立產國的責任這件工作，應該當仁不讓的。我們不必諱言，上海市的許多工會裏必有許多國民黨黨員在活動，同時也必有若干共產黨黨員乃至其他黨派的份子在活動，在彼此競爭活動的中間，大家自然都想爭取工人群眾的同情與擁護。但亦惟其如此，我們必須注意兩點：第一，工運幹部必須身為群眾，與工人同生活，共甘苦。若處於只知以勞工領袖自居，而實際上早已脫離了勞工群眾，則工運必一輩子沒有希望。尤其不能因為自己不去接近群眾，就把接近勞工群眾的工運活動份子都一例看成「反動分子」，　之惟恐不遠，排之惟恐不國。否則將與喚起民眾共同奮鬥之旨，背道而馳，其結果勢必為淵驅雀。不久以前，中國勞動協會重慶分會的橫遭接收，就難免有這种惡劣的影響。國民黨如果眼光遠大一些，應該有此警覺！第二，工運幹部必須在實際上服務羣眾，從正路上領導羣眾。惟有忠實的服務，才能換得真切的信仰；亦惟有正當的領導，纔可避免歧途的危險。往往有一部分人，眼光極近，理解極淺，以為工運首在討好工友，於是不問工友提出要求，就不願一切的支持蠻幹，以為惟有如此，乃可爭取羣眾。其實，勞工正當的要求，應該無不與國家民族的要求相一致的，我們若果拋棄了國家民族　體的要求於不顧，而只看到勞工的局部利益，勢必引入歧途的。我們乘上海總工會改選之際，約略陳述對於工運問題之所見，深望國民黨和工界領袖們一加注意！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎六日廣播：美國務卿貝爾斯今日向德國人發表演說，聲稱，美國主張德國統一，至指責盟國之遷廷態度。貝氏演說之要點如下：（一）各盟國立即提出要求德國恪守之和約條件；（二）規定德國之疆界，（三）取消四佔領區間之種種隔閡；（四）行國在經濟上完全統一，（五）指責管制委員會之延宕政策。</p>
<p>〔聯合社德國新都伽特六日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯今日在此演說，稱：「美國贊成德境早日成立德國政府，安全佔領軍或須長期留駐德境。余不欲有所誤解，吾人決不委卸任務，吾人並未撤退，德境長此需要佔領軍，則美軍始終為佔領軍之一部份」。貝氏係在此美軍佔領區德方臨時政府所在地，向德方及聯合國要員演說，衆認其演詞為戰後美國政治家發表之最重要外交政策言論。為保障安全起見，守衛之憲兵較平常人數增加四倍。</p>
<p>貝氏切言美國決定欲見德國重新長成為集團力量之和平國家，對於法國要求萊因區及魯爾區，則加拒絕，並警吿波蘭與蘇聯，謂美國並不認為德國東陲將沿奧得河劃定，現在波蘭兩國所佔土地，乃在波茨坦「臨時派定」者，且「波茨坦會議協定，訂明政府首腦和平解決時，均不擁護割讓任何特別區域」，貝氏力促早日成立德國中央政府，稱：就許多重要問題而言，四國管制委員會旣不管理德國，又不許德國自行管理。聯合國所能為，且應為者，厥為規定德國可自行管理之規律。聯合國佔領軍應限制人數，祗須足以保障德國服從此等規律。美國政府意見，德國臨時政府不應由他國政府挑選，但應為德國之國民議會，由四個佔領區內已經成立數省之民主負責要員組成之。國民議會除受聯合國管制委員會保留權力之管轄外，應負責推進中央行政機關之正當工作，而中央行政機關應有充分權力，確保德國成為一個經濟單位之行政事宜，如波茨坦協定所訂定者。</p>
<h3>英表示熱烈贊同</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎六日廣播倫敦訊：貝爾納斯在史都伽特之演說，深得英官方人士之熱烈贊同，對貝氏所稱波蘭在德境之行政當局，僅為臨時性政權，表示見解相同，對貝氏就法國所作一節演辭，亦表示同意。彼等謂英政府之目的，首在去除英國佔領區內之經濟困難，俾使該區人民能自給自足，因該區現狀造成英國之重負也。</p>
<h3>德境英美佔領區　經濟機構合倂　另設新機構由德人主持其事　美佔領區治績可觀</h3>
<p>〔聯合杜柏林五日電〕美軍及英軍佔領區當局今日宣布，已共同成立協議，內容包括四點，規定將美軍及英軍佔領區內之基本經濟機構予以合倂，另設新機構，由德國人主持其事。同時兩區內之生活程度亦使其相同，配給數量亦將劃一。此外兩區內之經濟資源將合倂使用，並採取相同之進出口貿易政策。惟據稱在政治上兩區無合倂之意。</p>
<p>〔聯合社德國弗朗克福五日電〕德境美國佔領軍司令麥克那尼今日發表談話，稱道美國佔領區之德國自治政府，略謂，德國可望復為國際社會間受尊敬的一員，絕非過甚之詞。但此僅指美軍佔領區之德國政府機構而言，此一機構較任何其他佔領區存在者為進步。另一方面，整個德國之政治進步，則等於零。麥氏此項言論，適在國務卿貝爾斯突然訪問美國佔領區前夕發表。麥氏並稱，貝爾納斯將精硏及澄淸美國對德政策，但拒絕說明其言論與貝爾納斯所擬發表之演說，有何關係。麥氏縷述美國佔領軍情形如下：</p>
<p>「解除武裝」就德國軍隊而論，此舉業已完成，軍事設備正照預定計劃拆除中。</p>
<p>「賠償」較預定計劃略為落後，此由於德國經濟不能統一，及德國未來疆界未能確定之故。</p>
<p>「再教育」進行順利，靑年訓練計劃，為使德國民主化之最重大使命。</p>
<p>「　　」　預定計劃進行。</p>
<p>「難民之遣散與安撫」較預定計劃「大為落後」。目下平均每日有猶太人一千一百名，自波蘭潛入美國佔領區，食宿發生問題。法國已允收容猶太難民五千，捷克可能收容一萬，義大利亦可收容一萬，比利時可收容一兩千，凡此提議，均以不使難民永久居住為條件。</p>
<h3>王外長定明日　離巴黎返國</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京六日電〕據可靠息：巴黎和會中國代表團團長五世杰，將於八日啓程，可望於本月十三日返抵首都。此行與巴黎和會之　行無　，實因另　要公須待親環。聯合國大會定於本月廿三日在紐約開會，中國方面須有種種決定，此即為王氏返國原因之一。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎五日專電〕我外長王世杰今午在我駐法大使錧，設宴招待法國高級官員十二人，其中有法總統兼外長皮杜爾及法制憲議會議長赫里歐。</p>
<h3>何應欽參觀美海軍學校</h3>

<h3>貝文昨主持和會全會　塲內座位半虛懸　小組委員會一片爭噪聲　特港隸屬問題展開激辯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎六日廣播：和會全會今日下午二時開會，由貝文任主席，塲內座位一半虛懸，代表席中僅由一人出席者甚多。開會後，伊拉克外長却馬利首先發言。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎六日電〕英國今日警吿和會，如果不予特里挽斯特以眞正「國際」自由港地位，則英國將退出劃維尼齊亞求里亞區之四國協定。英代表麥克尼爾在和會發言，先斥南斯拉夫要求管理特港之「特別地位」，繼稱，如果特港獨立遭受損害，英國將「重行考慮整個協定」。英方聲明此種立塲，係答覆斯拉夫各國要求南斯拉夫控制特港。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕和會對義領土及政治委會頃開會討論最感棘手之特港隸屬問題，各國代表均知此項問題之危險性，莫不小心翼翼，有如在火藥桶旁吸紙烟，稍一不愼即足以經起滔天大禍。首由蘇外次維辛斯基發言，將義總理及協理所提出之論據，一一加以廢斥，並謂特港與維尼齊亞求里亞區之居民共計一百萬人，其中三分之二為斯拉夫人，僅有若干城市係屬義籍，但此一地區必須視為整個而不可分割者。如以該區讓與義國，則義國勢將向東發展。以言將該區實行國際化一項建議，其結果徒然引起各國之不滿，南國所提出之備忘錄最値得吾人之重視云。委員會旋即散會，至明日午前九時繼續開會，屆時波蘭英法曁烏克蘭四國代表對於此一問題，均將發表意見。</p>
<h3>對義賠款要求　希阿陳述理由</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎五日電〕義大利經濟委員會，今晚開會達九十分鐘，因是否應准阿爾巴尼亞代表參加一點，引起劇烈爭執。阿爾巴尼亞前已正式提出申請，南斯拉夫亦予支持，惟希臘則表反對。蘇代表阿魯裘寗則竭力反對希臘之干涉，阿氏謂「余誠不解此一簡單之禮儀問題，何以竟遭希臘之阻撓，且向該一小國充分撥洩其仇恨與侵略性之感情。」蘇代表與主席爭辯達五十分鐘之久，主席乃主張將此事交付表決，而蘇代表又責其違法，一時但聞爭噪之聲，其他代表亦加入爭辯，秩序為之大亂。至是法代表解釋規則，即阿國代表得出席委會發表意見，而在辯論時旁聽，此案乃經委會通過。</p>
<h3>一字之爭面紅耳赤　軍事委會不歡而散</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕和會對義軍事委員會本日開會時，各代表對於對義和約中「貨物」一字之含義，反覆爭辯，面紅耳赤，結果並無定義。希臘代表力辯「貨物」即「戰爭材料」之謂，烏克蘭代表則謂，關於義大利奪取催　　　　之　　　爭材料，其賠償問題應交由賠償委會處理，英代表指出「貨物」包括不能確認之財產損失在內，最後決定延期再行討論。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎五日合衆電〕今日英蘇兩國代表於和會軍事委會上，互相攻擊甚烈，時主席波蘭代表莫塞遂起立退出會塲，渠稱，君等如繼續爭論，余惟有退出會塲。會議於　　三小時之無結果爭論後，未得任何進展。莫塞稱，渠未見任何妥協徵象，遂決宣布散會。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎六日廣播：巴爾幹與芬蘭經濟委會今日繼續審查第四節第廿四條，俱係關於羅馬尼亞賠償之問題。法國代表團希望羅馬尼亞代表團應准予出席陳述有關各項意見。</p>
<h3>烏克蘭抨擊英希　英代表力自辯護</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約五日電〕英代表賈德幹在安理會中答覆烏克蘭外長馬努伊爾斯基對英希兩國之指責稱，馬努伊爾斯基並未能提出證據，即使提出，安理會對於少數民族亦無直接責任。葛羅米柯謂英國利用英軍，干涉希臘之工會，余覺任何人均不欲重視此項指責。貝文外相前曾邀請蘇聯參加四國委員會，調查希臘情况，但未為蘇聯所接受。英軍在希臘具有光榮之記錄，英軍在蘇聯或烏克蘭被迫參戰前之數月，即已犧牲無數生命，以圖保衛希臘，該一武裝之干涉，確實使希特勒之攻蘇延遲多月始行發動。賈氏繼謂，聯合國憲章，並無禁止一會員國，雖經他會員國之邀請，仍不得在該他國駐兵之規定，余欲請問不久以前蘇軍在伊朗究係所為何事。賈氏繼提出兩點：第一，希臘之現狀並不較其他未經安理會調查之歐洲若干國為劣，第二，共黨若不在希臘境內施壓力，作宣傳，則希臘之局勢必能更好。希臘之要求僅為任其自為而已。查聯合國之原意，乃為各國若有糾紛，應先自謀解決，如無結果再向安理會聲請。今不此之圖，某一會員國竟亳無理由，突然在安理會席上提出控訴，發表侮辱之言論，此例一開，則安理會尊嚴盡失，而聯合國機構之目的亦蕩然無存矣。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎六日廣播：由於蘇外長莫洛托夫之堅持，坡杜爾今日下午四時突然召開四强外長特別會議，大致將集中於聯合國大會是否延期舉行，抑如期於九月廿三日在紐約召開。</p>
<h3>渡英吉利海峽到巴黎去（上）　藝術之都咖啡氣濃</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者雪岩</p>
<p>〔巴黎八月十六日航訊〕從倫敦坐火車到巴黎，途中共費九小時半；但其中整整四小時費於渡海，實際車行僅五小時半。英吉利海峽在杜佛和卡萊之間，本來是很狹的，大約祗三十哩。穿　地道原不困難，事實上也已有好多人提議過，但這樣便利行旅的建設，却含有國防上的危險性。英倫孤懸的三島，如有了這樣一條與大陸溝通往來的捷徑，一旦有事，未免威脅這島國的安全性，所以英國寗願讓渡海的人呌苦，而始終不肯輕易冒這個危險。記者因事須</p>
<p>往巴黎一行</p>
<p>早晨坐九點二十分火車離開倫敦，中午十一點鐘已到杜佛出入國境，照例有一套手續，同車二百多人都排了隊等候檢查護照行李。英國人辦事愼重而不嚕囌，緩慢而很週到，這是記者自到英國以來所一再體認到的，這次旅行無異再度印證。假使英國民族性中有卓異的優點，這便該是最主要的特點。二百餘人的檢查手續，在一小時半以內完全辦了，渡輪開行約在十一時半左右。英吉利海峽，向以風浪著名，所以渡海雖僅費一小時半，一般旅客多視為長途，不慣航海的人到此，能够不暈船不嘔吐，而安然渡過的很少。記者渡海的一天，雖然天朗風靜，但船一開動，即上下顚蕩，立時感到天旋地轉，逆氣上冒，自覺有點支撑不住。但英人到底是好運動而又好</p>
<p>航海的民族</p>
<p>船身儘管擺動，許多同船旅客臉色儘管逐漸蒼白，但仍很多人未受影響，他們非特不以此為苦，似乎反以此為樂。年靑男女紛紛趕至船舷房，看白浪的跳動，和同伴中是否有人感到異樣，以為互相笑謔的資料。挨過這一個半鐘點後，就到卡萊，便是法國境內了。一眼看去，予旅客最明顯的印象，是戰爭破壞之烈，和法國人民的富有，遠不及英人。倫敦雖也遭過德國人的轟炸，英國也隨處可見殘垣頹屋，但不像卡萊那樣數哩以內，整片剷平。待火軍出站以後，好多時內，還見不到完整的房舍，祗有損毀的斷鐵銹鋼，傾臥在瓦堆廢墟上，看了令人不免心悸。</p>
<p>法國碼頭上</p>
<p>招呼旅客的工役，雖大致也還整潔，一律穿着靑布制服，但不免有襤褸的人參雜其間，不像英國那樣，人人服裝整齊，連乞丐也並無顯然露於表面的窮相。而工人之多，亦遠過英國碼頭，這也是說明英國富過法國的一點。英國人少事多，雖然也有失業的人，但嚴格講來，不是眞正無事可幹，而是許多英人不願幹報酬少，任務苦的事，寗願坐吃候機。聽說英國礦工很多是義大利和波蘭人，原因是英國本國人不願任礦工，所以任何塲合，任勞役的總不致人浮於事。法國的碼頭不能保持這個水準，就不免有競爭生意的現象，即使你手中提一件極小的行李，總也有好幾個人</p>
<p>兜上來效勞</p>
<p>。中國碼頭上，一個旅客總有好幾十工役，像蒼蠅趕死鲞式的，同時蜂擁上來，狠命爭奪，彷彿把旅客都要一口氣吞下去似的，自然又當別論，這是東方人生活競爭劇烈的特色。此外在討索報酬方面，法國工役也遠不如英國人那樣雍容大方。一路提着皮箱，跟着你走，口裏不斷地在向你要價，一先令！二先令！或三十或五十法郎！都爭得很起勁！反之，英國工役大多隨你開發，你不過分，他決不向你還價，事實上給錢的人並不因此而稍刻薄。英國人君子風度的美名，果然也能在這種細微之處獲得印證；但二國財富的不同，當是更重要的實際原因。</p>
<h3>印度動亂不已　連日死傷已達千人　尼赫魯今日廣播闡明政策</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦六日廣播：印度孟買等地之動亂，今日有增無已，死傷已達一千人，其中二〇三人已死亡，被捕者逾二千人。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社新德里五日電〕據宣稱，印度內閣總理尼赫魯，將於本月七日發表演說，闡明臨時政府所採取之政策。由德里電台廣播，午後八時三十分一次用印度語，八時四十五分一次用英語，此係尼赫魯初次在印度電台廣播演說。同時據消息靈通人士談稱，臨時政府最先着手之改革事宜，將為取消鹽稅，此種賦稅，在多數印度人眼中，認為外人統治之象徵。其實此亦舊有賦稅之一種，在紀元前三百年，摩雅王朝即已實施，其後由回教徒曁英人先後保留。此項賦稅之取銷，將使每一印度人，每年可節省一盧比。</p>
<h3>希攝政辭職</h3>

<h3>英埃談判停頓</h3>
<p>癥結在蘇丹問題</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎六日廣播開羅訊：此間「阿朗」報評稱：蘇丹問題為使英埃談判趨於停頓之主要原因，故我人應特別重視埃及首相賽特基之聲明。賽特基謂：埃代表團要求將蘇丹處於埃王同一統治之下，此事英方可毋須恐懼，我人僅要求將埃蘇兩地聯合而已，此外並無其他向蘇丹之企求，所謂蘇丹人拒絕此種聯盟之說，完全不確，埃相發表上述聲明後，即接見蘇丹代表團長阿柴哈里，蘇丹代表雖無參預談判之權利，但始終與埃政府保持密切聯絡云。</p>

<h3>增加房捐秋秀開始？　財局擬定新辦法　將向參議會提出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕　財政局負責人談：該局正　向市參議會　出增加　捐之新　法，即　問　　租是否增加，房捐予以　獨增加。按照中央法令·原則上房捐　　房租微收，然　房租不　理，　可　財政　　定　捐之標準，目前本市　種之不合理，乃衆所共知，如此。房捐自無再迫隨房租之理由，故擬自秋季起，　　新　法，由百分之十四根高至百分之二十、其徵</p>

<h3>監守自盜案　缉獲同黨　津浦路局押貨員　南京銷贓得千餘萬　四犯北逃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕津浦鐵路押貨員馮振邦竊盜十二件棉布一案，詳情已誌昨報。津浦鐵路當局爲責任攸關，特派稽査孫樹仁·李廣惠二人來滬會同兩路警務處進行偵査。前日深晚，已捕獲從犯馬雲起（見圖）一名，並由馬犯供出竊盜經過如下：</p>
<p>主犯馮振邦，　廣瑞，（馮爲押貨員，雷爲徐州行李房職員）均係僞「華鐵」舊員，與馬同爲瀋陽人，當時馮雷進「華鐵」，皆爲馬所介紹，故三人關係極爲密切。此次盜竊計劃，馮曾早於徐州站陳百川交運貨物時即已計議妥常，由雷廣瑞先三日至南京站守候，迨馮押車抵京，雷即利用僞造之一自理包裹票」，冒充貨主，向南京行李房提取棉布十二件，雷約貨後，雇馬車運藏於童姓友人家中，馮則仍押其餘貨物來滬交卸，當時在北站諉稱餘十二件待裝中，並簽「授受證」，故當時被其朦過。馮於交卸貨物後，即忽忽返京，與雷及馬雲起在河南路大華飯店闢室計議出售贓物辦法，並邀馮之同學楊載環，楊載炎兩兄弟參預，計議將贓貨分三批出售，共售得一千二百萬元（原値三千萬元）。馬犯所悉第一批售與南京鴻興布號，計得四百餘萬元，餘二批尙待偵査。馬分得贓款一百萬元。</p>
<p>分贜旣</p>
<p>馮·雷及楊載環·楊載炎·馬雲起聯袂來滬，於菜市路同樂旅社闢十四號十六號兩室，一方面化名向蓬萊路東北難民招待所登記回籍。馮雷及楊氏兄弟乃於本月二日乘招商局海川輪赴津，馬因有家眷，故仍留滬。路局偵査人員因馮等皆爲東北人，料其事發後必將回籍，故曾向東北難民招待所査閱難民登記簿，發現內有馮寳琠（馮之化名）張烈（雷之化名）二名，均無照片，而登記之年齡籍貫均與馮雷二人相符，並悉曾據自稱投考南京中央大學不取，故取道上海返鄕。路局孫李二稽査即覺此二人可疑，根據其所塡臨時住址，會同泰山警察分局前往偵査，得將馬犯捕獲。</p>
<p>據馬自供</p>

<h3>大會會場次逸園</h3>
<p>（本報訊）本市首届市參議會，原定在大西路前德國學校舉行，茲因該處地勢過低，如過大雨，將受影響，同時會塲狹小，不够容納，故經市參議會決定，改在陝西路逸園大飯店舉行，可設座位的六百隻。會塲佈置，計劃在大廳正中面對主席台設議員席六排，每排十六座位，左右兩旁再分設各四十二座位，合下左右設紀錄席，再左右各設十六座位，以便市府人員列席，議員席外圈爲記者席及來賓席，大廳二樓走廊亦設旁聽席，該會規定每一參議員各發旁聽證一張，供議員戚友出席。候補參議員列席問題，尙待內政部決定，現暫予準備旁聽證，如欲參加者可往領取。塲中除主席合上設擴音器一架外。另備一架備議員發言之用。參議會以逸園飯店晚上仍須營業，每日必將桌椅移出移進，故不擬在會塲中多予佈置，會塲外看球台，擬作休息之用，並由逸園飯　　負　供應　　點心，　　購食　　　價目一倍以上。</p>

<p>顏惠慶博士旋即起立致稱：余於十三年前在國際聯盟會席上曾大聲疾呼，滿洲問題必須解決，吾則將有第二次大戰發生，當時無人相信，亦不加關注。而於六年前，余經渦國內外各地，已遇到各國準備大戰矣。於是各聯合國均希望美國領導應戰，結果美國確能領導完成戰勝使命。中國人民對於外交問題，甚至中國本身問題，均需要有更深之學識。裴斐敎授對於國際問題，有極大之硏究，對於中國問題洞悉明瞭，允爲吾國多數人所不及。所謂旁觀者淸，裴斐敎授必能以誠懇直率之心吿吾等以世界人士對中國之評論，使吾人認淸今後應走之路，而不要蒙蔽。</p>
<p>在座者有詢以今日中國之國民應以何種態度來觀察當前大局，裴氏表示不便答覆，但稱中國人不受外人之勸告，亦不應接受外人之勸吿。然應認淸目前之戰爭已非十八或十九世紀之戰爭，亦非張作霖·馮玉祥時代之一內戰，應以一般之心理來研究大局。</p>
<p>又問：美國在國際領袖地位，允以遠東方面而論，將準備維持至何種程度？裴氏答稱：其本人不能代表美政府發言，但依個人意見，美國並不願以領袖自居，　人亦不希望　國　此做，但美國將負起其應盡之一份　任，以全力爲世　和平而効勞。裴氏最後答覆奚玉書氏所問「　國一般人士對　國之看法如何」，感慨而曰：中國已渡過一個時代，余本人此次返華，發覺中國並未得到其八年苦戰後應得之報酬，所得印象頗感失望。</p>

<h3>海軍艦隊指揮部上校　被秘告接收舞弊　牽涉商店查詢否認　清查團正向處理局追查原始清册</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近有人致函淸査團，密吿現任海軍艦隊指揮部陳永欽上校，祖任接收敵偽楊樹浦倉庫時，利用權勢，霸佔民用汽車，盜運倉庫物資，如汽油·呢絨·米·糖·肥皂·五金等，後更利用卡車，大量偸運，勾結同鄕池化龍及阮某，秘密銷售。淸査團蒞滬後，急將盜竊物資，售賣一空。英士路駱駝商店，即曾收買偸竊之日用品。密吿函內並稱陳永欽於八一三滬戰發生後，即蟄居滬上，曾與阮某狼狽爲奸，擔任敵方工作云。</p>

<h3>改進上海中等教育芻議（下）</h3>
<p>— 謝恩皋</p>
<p>又如北區宋公園後柳營聞亦有數百畝之大，此處地產原屬本市所公有，戰前曾有闢為公共體育塲之議，旋以戰事發生作罷。江灣前勞動大學校基連農塲地產亦不為小，現均在荒廢之中，建設北區中等教育區，均可利用。滬南沿浦江北岸公地亦甚多，如經詳細調查，必有發現。浦東地價現時尚不過高，徵用一中等教育區基地，亦非不可能事，再說四個中等教育區的建設，視財力情况，可以分期完成，今日着手，不妨先從西區開始，以其地產現成，茍得中央許可，即可設計施工。每一中等教育區以三百畝至四百畝為建築公共建築物之用，其餘每卅畝至四十畝劃為一個中學基地，每區多則四十個中學基地，少則三十個中學基地，而由各私立中等學校自由承租興建校舍。公共建築物如圖畫館，大會堂，理科實騐室，醫院，音樂館，美術館等，統由政府視實際需要，統籌建築，務期內部充實完善足敷各該區中學學生充分應用，公用事業如道路，溝渠，橋梁，水電，煤汽，路燈，電話，電報，郵政，救火設備，警衛設備，花木，園林，草地，以及公共交通車輛等，亦由政府負責分請各有關主管機關代為計劃設施完成。生活有關事業如公共食堂，銀行，圖書文具店，日用品店，洗衣店，剪髮店，浴室等；則招商承建於指定範圍內；惟須捐建相當公共建築物，而後可以取得此項營業權利。政府負責籌建之公共建築物，如感財力不敷，不妨向社會公開捐募，無論個人或團體，凡捐建之建築物，即以其個人或團體之名題名，以垂久遠。如是社會熱心教育人士之富有資產者，必能聞風興起，共襄此一義舉。每一中等教育區，政府方面亦可建立一二所公立中等學校於其內，以作示範之用。其餘則徵求私立中等學校承租基地，於指定限期內各自籌款興建自用校舍，建築計劃必須經過專家設計製定，建築形式必須經過政府審查合格，務期各項建築外表內容，均臻完美。各校基地酌收少量租金，其目的僅在保證產權屬之公家所有。重要特殊建築設備旣由公家負責籌劃，則各校所欲自建者，不過為普通教室，學生與教師宿舍，辦公室等而已，比之每一學校分開建築，各項設備均須自謀，節省經費多多，此一計劃推進以後，高初中學生必須全部住宿校內，教育力量即可滲透到學生整個生活裏面，而使其精神隨時在相互感應過程當中，理想隨時在繼續成長過程當中，像今日這種殘缺而不完整的中等教育，便無形减少。到了相當時期，也許就會淘汰盡凈，上海中等教育即可澈底改造完成。關於建設經費籌劃問題，較為困難，然以上海財力之富，集合政府與社會多方面力量分工合作，分期完成，似非不可能事。政府方面旣已有了分年籌劃鉅額教育基金的舉撒旦，最好這筆教育基金先行組織委員會來充分運用，免得放在銀行裏日在虧蝕之中。等到數額相當可觀時，即以其息金撥作中等教育區公共建築物建設費用。等到市區中等學校移入以後，所遺市區中學校舍設備一律作為擴充國民教育之用。將來除國民學校可以散布在市區外，其他中等學校均須集中四郊，不會再有視學校為傳舍，視教師為知識販賣者的中等學校存在。</p>
<p>實現了上一計劃，上海中等教育必大為改觀，其可預想得到的益處，至少有後列三點：</p>
<p>（一）靑年有了充滿愉快適應需要的理想教育區，便可整個離開不良的現實環境，日在富有活力的文化領域中生活，經過長期有秩序有意義快樂而活潑的集體訓練與培育，必能塑成國家社會後一代有用而幹練的中堅人物。</p>
<p>（二）主辦學樣的先生們，受着環境的暗示與督促，感於靑年教育，職員之重大與工作之艱鉅，必然遇事奮起，專心一志，以期對國家對社會有所報稱。決不會再如過去可以泄泄沓沓，不求精進，甚至另具目的，而以辦學為手段了。</p>
<p>（三）學校集中辦理，教師薈萃一處，相互觀摩硏究，比賽競爭，皆有助於教導方法之改進與交通之增强。不但如此，舉凡教師各項福利事業，不論衣食住行，任何方面，均可實行消費合作，減輕教師生活負擔，使其眞能得到安居樂業的幸福。</p>
<p>談改進上海中等教育，當然不止在改時物質建設一方面。然能先於物質建設一方面有了眞正改進的辦法，則其他一切改進問題，亦可順利進展，不須多所顧慮了。是否有當，尚望賢達有以匡正！</p>

<p>沉默的和平使者　　〔聯合社九江五日電〕蔣主席赴牯嶺後，馬歇爾物使為使政府和南京中共代表間的聯絡不斷起見，曾決定擬於每周末赴牯嶺一行，馬使並特為派了十二位工作人員，携同各種機構設備來九江，協助完成聯絡的工作。這些人的名字，我們很少聽得到有人提起，但他們卻正為了中國的和平而在默默的工作。牯嶺的山路峻峭難行，自山　經過無數的石階，始可到牯嶺山村，乘坐山轎，也需要兩小時之久，馬使的牯嶺行館，正和牯嶺山村一樣，在平時，事實上可說是與外界斷絕往來的，因為它與山下的交通非常不便。這裏誠然是一個避暑勝地，可惜馬使並沒有工夫在此過消夏的生活。為了與南京保持聯絡，必須在牯嶺建立迅速而可靠的通訊工具，同時還需要供給馬使專機駕駛員有關氣候的情報，以免浪費時間，作無謂的飛行。為了適應此種需要，美國陸軍人員，在一個月前已經開始工作了，參加工作的人，係自馬尼刺，東京，琉球，南京及北平各地召來，他們居住的地方，與鄉間其他地方有着很顯明的區別，因為那裏有一條滿鋪靑草的跑道，可以供飛機降落。在楊金少校的指揮下，這一塊地方，也頓時變得有了生氣。這一個小小的團體，分住在六個帳幕內，幕上　蓋着草蓆，以　　日。他們所飲的水，是全區最乾淨，最清潔的水，是污濁的江水經過美軍的濾水設備過濾後變成功的。濾水設備包括蓄水池和抽水機等，利用化學原料，將水濾清。抽水機每小時可　水五加侖，美軍自有洗衣房，所用的熱水是把水底火油爐放在水桶內燒熱的。此外，他們還有淋水浴設備，病院及一個龐大的冰箱，為了解決娛樂問題，楊金少校曾監督建造了一卒小型球場，他們有時分做六人一隊踢足球，或者打排球，影戲也有得看，每個帳幕裏都有一架無線電收間機，可以聽到美國的節目。他們時常可以吃到馬使南京或牯嶺廚房裏送來的蛋糕和點心，他們與牯嶺每天有四小時可以通無線電話，而且與飛向此間或他去的飛機，也都保持着聯絡。最近一架美國　　機飛往南京時，突然發生了障碍，靠了一個引　飛行，但終於藉着無線電話的指導，而安危到達目的地，他們把天氣情形報吿南京，並同時收　南京的天氣報吿，以決定馬使是否宜於起飛。飛機在天空時，也與他們不斷通話，他們有一個「救火隊」，那是一輛漆成祥紅色的吉普卡，上面裝着最新的救火設備，以備飛機降陸發生不幸時之用，同時也還可以當救護車用，這般美軍都羨慕並崇敬馬歇爾特使，馬使常常於上飛機是停下來同他們閒談，或者聽無綫電，問問營中的情形。有一天，一個魯莽的美軍，剛洗完澡出來，正巧接見馬使，這個美軍更感慌張，把身上的毛巾拉的緊而又緊，不知是立着好，還是坐着好，五星上將幫助他渡過了這個難關，馬使伸出手來，笑容可掬地向他說：「我的名字叫馬歇爾，你呢？」爪哇僑胞遭焚殺　六日爪哇文登埠訊  伯明寄　　爪哇文登埠，自荷軍進駐以來，華僑之安全問題，已成為全國僑胞關懷之目標。在此一周中，文登四萬華僑，所受之浩刦，比之倭寇在一九四二年侵入時所受者，尤超出數百倍。蓋四年前所受者，僅係財產之損失，而今印尼人竟作慘無人道之集體屠殺。我政府一向關懷僑胞生活，對此慘案當有「乳牛」被屠一般的苦痛與憐　，亟須謀取善後辦法，否則爪哇僑胞將無噍類矣！（編者）　　軍軍絡繹不絕　　記者昨日午後搭　紅會貨車赴文登，車上載麥粥一百箱，乃養紅會撥充該埠難僑，臨時救濟者。車循文登路開出，沿途公路破壞不堪，一步一窟窿，顛簸曲折，幾如行舟。衹勃信時，寂無人聲，所有居民已遷徙一空，僅有荷車一隊把守，檢查過往行旅。初荷軍勸吾人勿輕進，蓋無武裝之車輛，隨時有受阻擊之危險，吾人吿知此行賑濟工作後，荷軍乃派一武裝軍士隨車護送。　　勃信至「曾加連鎮」一段，月前曾一度激戰，公路破壞尤鉅。咫尺地方，　有一大陷坑，沿路大樹，均為印尼人砍倒作障礙物。障礙物現雖已移去，但甫填平之公路，則有行不得也哥哥這嘆，曾加連鎮印尼人似已搬空，「吧煞」已燒成平地，曾為印尼軍總部之地主大廈，僅存四壁，轟立綠　中。曾加連與「哇都則北」二鎮，均駐有荷軍，惟沿途景象荒涼，僅見二三印尼挑夫躑躅路旁。川中禾稻，已屆收成時期，惟田主是否仍在，則尚屬一問題。一路軍車絡繹不斷，車上無不滿載文登難僑，稍裕者則用馬車運載，彼等家產蕩然，九死一生，乃遷來城中，依靠親戚或待華總救濟也。　　「哇都則北」附近之男女兒童感化院，曾充印尼軍軍營，印尼軍撤退時，縱火焚燒，但破壞並不鉅。附近田地，荷軍關作小飛機場，二架小型運輸機停在場中，頗增興趣，由機場直至吧煞，所有房屋，均為荷軍徵用。　　名村慘遭焚殺　　闊別五年之文登，面目雖依舊，但人事已幾歷滄桑矣。市內景象蕭條，家家戶戶雙扉緊　，惟見荷槍實彈之荷軍來往不絕而已。至於印尼人則極稀少，同僑數十成羣，站立「吧煞」中張望，在中華總會中，吾人獲睹由附近逃出之同僑男女難民，衣衫襤褸，形容憔悴。記者與治安會華總負責人及各難民交談，得悉此次浩刦真象，尤以難胞所述各村被焚殺情形，殘酷無道，旣令人發指，亦使人毛骨悚然也。　　自荷軍進攻勃信後，文登印尼方面即宣傳荷軍中有華僑參加，故即嚴禁華僑來城，間有冒險間道小徑或田野來吧者，一經攔截，誅殺無赦。故自該時起，文登與吧城之間信息乃吿隔絕。惟文登華總對印尼軍政方面，以應付得當，幸得相安無事。　　五月中旬，吧聯軍當局諮文文登印尼軍，謂根據雙方協定，聯軍將進駐至芝沙丹尼河以西界限，故促印尼軍須於月底前撤退。自上月十七日，印尼人即開始作有計劃之疏散，携箱載籠，寸物必搬，印尼官眷亦相率離去。至二十五日，印尼共和軍開始撤至布拉拉耶，憲兵退至朱鹿，而民軍則守在耶帝前綫，文登市內只留下數十憲兵。當印尼開始搬走時，印尼國民委員會委員及共和軍，曾一度表示華僑亦須跟隨疏散，否則當為助敵之表示。後經華總當事人與軍政大員折衝，所持理由是華僑人數眾多，無地可收容，至此，印尼方面始不堅持華僑疏散之事。二十五日共和軍撤退完畢，忽有附近各村之印尼人六七百名，持刀執槍，自稱是民軍，　擁入市中，謂將維持治安。華總遂設法安置彼等，每晚養以飯食，暫得茍安。荷軍於二十八日午後一時，開入城中。　　爪哇景物：吧城新區馬路　　由反荷而仇華　　荷軍開入之前夕，華總主席蔡文理君之住家及貨倉，為印尼人三次縱火焚燒，全家燒毀，損失鉅大。　火原因未詳，惟　熟悉內幕者稱：蔡君對面，有一僑生在吧城尼加軍中服務，共和軍乃仇視其家，適該僑生有年已及笄之姊妹一人，為一下級軍官垂涎。思佔為己有，蔡君將情投吿共和軍上　，該軍官諒受斥責，乃挾嫌報復云。除蔡君住家外，縣丞署後部亦被燒去大部，監獄犯人全數釋放後，亦放火焚燒，僅餘涉嫌遭扣留之華僑三人，被局於小室中，葬身火窟。另有一牙醫之愛子及一汽車夫被帶走。因荷軍猝然開入，印尼方面未及作全面之破壞，遽倉卒撤退，全市華僑生命財產倖得保存，斯誠不幸中之大幸也。荷軍開入文登後，即開始布防，英軍數人，根據「君子協定」把守芝沙丹尼大橋，不准荷軍再越雷池一步，對於河西同盟國華僑之生命，則委之於「聽天由命」，而印尼人方面竟宣傳荷軍中華僑參加，於是突由反荷面轉為仇華之舉動。自河以西，民軍乃下「戰時法令」，所有華僑男性必須隨軍而行，否則處死刑，遺下之婦則任由暴徒姦殺焚燒。　　四鄉血淚斑斑　　文登縣轄下文登·茅渥·朱鹿及布拉拉耶四區，華僑共約四萬餘人。除文登一區安全外，其他三區華僑之生命已成草芥，財產大部已成廢墟，至昨日午後為止，茅渥一萬一千華僑，未有一人逃出，故彼等之安全如何，誠不堪聞問矣。文登市環近四周，如加烈，芝務命姆，拉哇根牙史，西八丹，高三美，芝浪我，沙比，加拉巴都亞，禾揚南加等華僑，有彼解走，有全家被殺戳，有婦孺被焚斃者，殘酷無道，慘絕人寰。間有幸能逃脫者，　伏夜行，匍匐而行，抵華總求救時，已無人形矣！逃入文登市內之難胞，至昨日為止，已達三千人，由華總給予食宿或寄住親屬家中。據由各村逃出者之報吿，昨日已有二十八起，均屬令人髮指之血淚，茲抄錄幾則如下：　　芝浪曾雲英報吿：三日午後七時，擁入持械印尼人數百名，將其岳父林燦輝，妻林春娘及內弟林長清捆綁於香火案前，然後縱火焚燒。曾君幸於九死一生中自側門跳出，伏在田中時，遙見全村同僑住家化成火海，為之號哭。　　沙比脫險之施　　女士報吿：　家十一口，連伊夫林畢萬，翁林姜偉，及十五歲之施金壽，一家十一口，全斃於刀下。　　加烈林成茂，黃懷娘及黃金娘，一家三口，慘被殘殺。伊弟黃偉金幸能逃出，但頭臂各受一刀傷。同村之盧慶英逃出報吿：三日有大批同村印尼人按戶搜殺華僑，衝入盧君住家者，竟為平日之鄰居五人，大叫華僑一槪均須處死，未及說情，盧君父母愛妻相繼死於利刀下。　　西巴端及比聲岸村，全村男婦被集中於巴剎空屋中後，縱火焚燒。由山居安村逃出之唯一難胞報吿：山居安為印尼人之屠場，沿途被押走之僑胞，均在此地被集體屠殺，其次克達翁亦設有印尼集中營，茅渥華總主席鄭忠怡全家均被囚在此處，印尼有端派視華僑如犬羊，囚在集中營之難胞均全身赤裸，每日牽出多人殺戮以為戲，殺時必揀較伶俐者。四人為一級，先令作緩步行，然後由後揮刀殺之，該難胞哭訴請速援救，或可救出多少殘命。　　西八丹黃增文，一家一十二口，二日晚八時，全村火光燭滅。槍聲，哭聲，討饒聲，震耳欲聾。黃君一家正　作一四時，屬　份子及鄰居多名衝入，立命黃君全家男女分立一邊，黃君及子姪四人見勢不妙，急由後門逃出，　身草　中，目睹便宜骨血十八口，一一慘死刀鋒上。最慘者莫過於伊姪媳之死，匪徒先用刀將懷孕九月之婦人，自胸劈至下部，然後取出腹中嬰孩踐踏。黃夫人投入井中，仍被撈起，施以極刑。黃君見狀，當時五內俱裂，據謂同村五十餘人，均遭毒手。　　以上所述，僅為文登十公里內之慘狀耳。至若茅渥·芝古柏·芝勒域·布拉拉耶等較大之市鎮，仍無消息，數萬同僑，安全可慮。　　現文登市內外已成廢墟，市內又成死市，數千難民，哀號待賑，而在印尼人手中者，又危如巢卵，凡此種種均待我全體僑胞團結合作，作一妥善善之援救全策也。文登荷縣丞昨日接見該埠華總主席，準備運　十五貨車救濟，蔡文禮·高進基二君昨日與記者等同車進城，擬晋謁蔣總領事及向各方呼　求救。」　　蔣總領事以芝沙丹尼河東岸僑胞被困待救，已向聯軍方面交涉，請其過河援救，聞聯軍已予應允。讀者意見學費超過標準　　目前教育界之嚴重現象，厥為學校收費過高，大多數學子均感徬徨無措，就會困難，尤以來自後方之靑年，最感頭痛，雖各校設有免費名額及助學等辦法，但能享受其惠者，究屬少數學生，本市私立大學，前傳繳費標準以四石米為例，近聞其中有巧立名目從中取巧者，藉收超過四石米之費額，傳聞虹口北四川路附近某教會大學法學院所擬繳費額，有超過四十萬元之說，聞該校大部學生為半工讀之公教人員，平時生活已極困苦，自此消息公佈後，多數學生皆惶恐終日，勢將有綴學之危，此種現象，苦不加糾正與補救，其結果所至，大多數家境清寒學生，與半工讀之公教人員，均將被擯教育之門外云。（虞衍俊）清潔清潔瓜皮堆積　　編者先生：常州警局最近為城區垃圾充斥，有礙市容，為整飭計，有清潔捐之設。訂定在武進電廠及戚　堰電廠各用戶燈電內，每度帶徴十五元，由警局派員駐廠征收，已簽呈孫縣長核準旅行，商會及臨參會亦予通過。垃圾之清除，警局區公所應負其責，清潔費用早在預算之內，豈不設此捐，城廂垃圾將聽其作古物保存乎？現清潔費徵收有數，乃街頭垃圾，堆積如故，故近日街坊茶社有「清潔！清潔！西瓜皮堆積」！之歌謠，其程度可見一般，況本邑居戶不裝電燈者甚多，彼等所棄垃圾，豈獨不負清除之義務？而由少數電燈用戶負担之，公耶不公耶？　　（顧源潤）謹上請撤除這鐵絲網罷　　編輯先生：敝人每日早上辦公去，回家來，總不免要經過這一幢精美的小洋房，（梵王渡路四〇號，敵偽時期是漢奸潘達的住宅），這幢房子內進出的人稀少，門口毫無人影，但卻安放着四架鐵絲網，（兩面各兩座），擋住了人行道，且此處又靠近五路公共汽車的停車站，每當汽車靠邊停車，行人很覺不便，且易發生危險，尤其在晚上一般眼力較差之行人，更易使衣裳扯破，皮膚捐傷，此不是對於交通方面很有關係嗎？我想在抗戰勝利已屆一週年的今日，實無放置這樣四重鐵絲網的必要，但不知是否出於住這屋者之意思，繼這樣做的麼？（康家橋一居民上）解決電車擁擠問題　　編輯先生：在貴報讀者投書欄內申訴交通困難的信，已經發表了很多，申訴虹口一路電車的車輛不敷，乘客擁擠，和秩序紛亂的種種情形，亦已不少，筆者是住在虹口的一個市民，幾乎天天要坐一路電車，憑幾個月來觀察的結果，覺得乘客之所以擁擠，和秩序的所以紛亂，有一個最大的原因，就是乘客中軍人，常常要佔到乘客的三分之一，或一半以上。守秩序的固大有人在，但越窗而入者，亦復不少，年富力強之市民，爭相效尤，老弱婦孺，祇能望車興嘆。竊以為軍從乘車，本無可誹議，惟軍事主管當局理應為此大量軍人之交通問題，謀一解決之道。茲獻議軍事主管當局，可依照美軍交通車辦法，利用輪重團體汽車或軍用卡車，在各軍隊駐紮處所，與市區交警，及熱門街道間，各遊樂中心，規定時間，長期行駛交通車，專供軍人免費乘坐，同時禁止軍人破壞秩序，和取締免費乘坐電車，如此則軍事當局，利用原有車輛及司機，僅略費汽油，即可使車人市民及電車公司均各受惠一舉三得，何樂不為，深盼本市軍事主管當局，加以採納。俞椿敬上。（九，二。）怪客新騙術　　編輯先生：萬有引力　全市銀樓業職員免受損失及社會幸福起見，將敝號等數家被騙經過情形，懇錯貴報一角，披露如後：本日下午四時許，正値敝號營業繁忙之時，來一形同兵士之顧客，持五錢三分赤金花戒一只求售，即由本人按市價付給國幣十萬〇五千元交伊點數，甫數兩萬，伊又欲購二錢綫戒一只，命我去取，因見業務篆書，故未等數清，即去取貨，待戒指取來，該主顧即盛氣凌人地責問我：「怎麼十萬塊錢少了四萬，八疊都是五千元，你們怎樣幹的。」當時弄得莫名其妙，欲辯又止，在伊盛氣威脅之下，祇得的退給他，由自己賠出上萬元了事。未幾對面幾家同業，亦發生同樣情形，各職員賠三五萬不等，相吿之下，始知遇騙，其調人離櫃新穎之騙法，銀樓業職員極易受愚，願各同事注意，以免無謂犧牲。四川北路六二〇號泰豐銀樓職員顧世忠規約　　（一）本欄絕對公開，文靑自負。但切忌冗長。（二）切勿攻計心人，切勿一稿兩投。（三）投稿人須寫明讀者意見稿件，並須興示眞實姓名及地址，但發表時得用筆名。（四）本欄稿件槪不致酬。（五）對來稿本報有刪節之權。（六）來稿披露與否，槪不函復。（七）本報於必要時，得將來稿轉致有關機關參考。</p>

<p>東北統一接收　中央社瀋陽航訊　　東北敵僞事業資產統一接收委員會熊兼主任委員式輝，爲歡迎東北區接收淸査工作團，並介紹與各特派員見面起見，特於木月十二日下午三時，在該會舉行茶會，出席熊兼主任委員式輝，張兼副主任委員嘉璈，及錢幽長公來等四十餘人，席間熊主委報吿接收槪况甚詳，茲錄全文如左：　　統一接收緣起與經過　　東北經日敵六十餘年之經營，十四年之倫陷，各項建設頗　規模，然自「八一五」勝利後，因經過幾度之掠奪與破壞，接收工作乃發生諸多困難，較之其他收復區之接收作情形不同，而責任亦愈繁重，中央亦特別重視此點，認爲非遴選對接收有經騐者前來東北辦理不可，又根據京滬平津一帶接收之經騐，爲避免軍事機關與非軍事機關，中央機關與地方機關，甚至中央各部會之間與地方省市之間，接收意見不一致，因而發生流弊起見，乃有「統一接收，　令分配八字原則之規定，於是行營於本年三月間，在錦州成立統一接收委員，迄今將達五個月之時問。　　組織系統與擬增機構　　本會　的組織，係由行營主任，政經兩委員會委員，及中央各部會審特派員爲委員，下設秘書監察兩處·軍政·內政·地政·財政·金融·糧政·經濟。交通。林蠱。社會·敎育·衛生·水利·宣傳。問法。善後救濟及生產·房地產。物資十八組。農務委員會。審議委員會·估價委員會三會。軍政等十五組接收。屬於中央之事業資產。其他由生產組。房地產組，物資組，接收農務委員會·係對僞滿興農部。興農合作社。興農命庫三機構·整個事業之接收而設，由社會部。財政部。農林部等接收人員所組織之審議委員會，爲解決產權糾紛而設。估價委員會，爲標賣工廠及物資等之估價而設。此外，尙擬增設處理處，淸算處，預定在近期內即行成立淸算處，正物色會計專家前來擔任。關於淸算，必須先有敵僞時代之財產底册，（原始淸册），其後爲蘇聯運走者若干，奸匪破壞者若干，得到實際接收數目，以備將來向日本抵算貽償，處理處爲接收後必要機構，現已接收者僅三省一市，尙有六省二市尙未接收，實際僅接收三分之一，惟此二分之一地方接收，如工　之授　　物之發　，房地奮之　査等，均已大部辦理完竣，亦可謂吿一段落，此後即廳步入處理及淸算階段。至於縱的組織，本會爲東北接收最高機關，並不直接辦理接收，僅負指導聯繫之責，其下各省市設分會爲執行機關，實際辦理接收，分會之組織與本會同，主任委員爲省主席或市長，委員省市政府委員，及中央各部會之接收委員，亦按事業性質分組分會，不設支會，縣長爲支會主任委員，此組織系統係在錦州所擬，迄今因支會之設立尙無必要。故未設立，實際本會爲兩級制，即本會與分會耳。　　接收法規與工作原則　　　本會為監督指導機關，未直接辦理接收之事，先後曾訂有法規章則等二十八種，頒發各分會，以爲接收之標準，其基本法爲「東北敵僞事業資產統一接收及處理辦法」，其餘關於組織者十三種，物資者四種，房地產者四種，生產者六種，至於接收狀况，各實際接收機關另有報吿。在縱的方面，有遼寗，遼北，吉林，長春各分會，在橫的方面，則有各部會署所組成之十八組，至各部門之報吿，千頭萬緒，爲明瞭重實際情形，應介紹與各組長見面，分組接談，作澈頭澈尾之報告，以免有掛一漏萬及籠統之弊。至於有歷史性地方事業之分配，當由重慶出發時，在行政院會商討多次，當時決定以「統一接收候令分配」八字爲原則，其最後決定權不在本會與行營，乃認於中央。　　希望於清查團者三事　　此次清查　　君，遠道而來，擔當此艱鉅工作，除執行中央賦予任務外，更希望對東北四千五百萬民衆之期望，予以滿足，對接收事業亦必多有裨益，甚感欣幸，本席希望於淸査團各位先生者，有三事，（一）本會工作人員有限，且當事者不如旁觀者之明。在接收方法如有不週之處，各位先生以第三者立塲，且都由外面來者，觀察較可淸楚，希望在工作方法上，能作本會一個導師，不吝予以指敎。（二）本會以有限之人力，擔負此種艱鉅之工作，所遭逢障碍之多，有非始意所及料者。各位先生以中央之立塲，且都由南京來者，希望能在工作推行上，能作本會援師，儘量予以助力。（三）本會各部份同仁，才力雖屬有限，但流血流汗，亦頗能奮鬥犧牲，不避艱難險阻，不辭勞怨，以求達成任務，在各部門職員中，如發現有營私舞弊，犯法亂紀者，無不嚴加懲處，無從掩飾，但過去外商猶有不甚明瞭眞像，信口雌黃，以爲凡屬接收人員，莫不類同盜賊者，不能不令人灰心短氣。今幸有淸査員到此，吾人希望各位先生能够加以澈底考査，是者是之，非者非之，以正社會觀聽，各位先生或由監察院，或由參政會所委託而來者，希望在工作結果上能作本會一位律師，加以公正評判，果能如上所述，則本會工作同人，自當勇氣十倍，我相信淸査團之成功，即爲本會之成功。　　（一）男宿舍（二）女宿所（三）診撩室（四）交誼廳西端（五）行李儲藏室（七）男浴室及女室浴（東北新聞攝影社攝）台灣　熱帶醫學　研究所透視  本報八月廿三日台北航訊　特派員江暮雲　　歐遊歸來的岸田博士，他領導記者詳盡地參觀了台灣熱帶醫學硏究所士林支所的各部，他用流利的英語訴着血淸和預防注射液的製作過程。他說預防注射菌苗是取傷寒，副傷寒，霍亂，鼠疫，流行性腦脊髓膜炎菌的標準苗，播稱在固體培養基，培義到一定的時間以後，騐查有無雜菌混入，然後正確地衡量採取，以生理食鹽水製成一定濃度的溶液，以之爲原液，另以各種培養基對原液作無菌的試騐，而後以0.5％的石炭酸加食鹽水冲淡原液到各所定的含菌量濃度，以後就可以分裝應川了。　　白喉預防注射液是採取一般的高級的學理，就是：　　白喉毒素十佛馬林一一一類毒素（無毒毒素）　　（D.Toxin）（Formalin）（Toxoid）　　白喉毒素是抗原，加了佛馬林的作用，减少對身體的毒力，但是並不减少抗原的防疫力，而成為適合於人體（抗體）的預防注射。這個製法是以Martin氏肉汁培養白喉捍菌，到九日檢査有無雜菌混入，施行一日間全殺菌後，以減菌濾紙濾過，復以Cbamberland氏濾過器再濾，檢定其合格的加佛馬林至。0.5％，靜置於室溫的一個月，經無菌試騐的檢査，始可供應用。　　大小動物　三百頭供試驗　　被圈養着的大小動物，約三百頭，作爲各種病菌試騐的對象。白喉預防注射液的檢定，（一）是以海猽和一百隻天竺鼠檢騐培養所得的濾液，就是注射於海猽的皮下，最小致死量是五百分之一公撮以上的强力者，始爲合格。（二）是將佛馬林加毒素的無毒試騐注射五—十公撮於海猽及鷄的皮下，檢定它確實是無毒和無菌。　　純馴的七〇頭小白兎是狂犬病預防苗的試驗品。將保存的狂犬病固定毒接種在家兎的腦內，到第五或第六天，發見家兎有麻痺症狀時，瀉血致死，以無菌（消毒）的操作，取它的脊髓，懸置有茸性鉀的罎中，使其　燥，至一日·二日·三日各爲一日苗，二日苗，三日苗，貯藏在甘油中，每種各切取0.5％公分長的六個切片，置於90％甘油加0.5％石炭酸液中，供諸應用，以上是十八個一組，要連續每天注射到十八天。　　五十頭犢牛和五·六條水牛，它的腹部剃光了毛，用石炭酸水消毒的皮膚面，就是採集粗苗之處；一頭小牛，可以製作供三萬人用的痘苗，最健康的三十匹馬，經常每隔三四天注射二百公撮的毒素，經過一個半月或兩個月，然後試血，檢定其血淸，可以作白喉血淸，也可以作破傷風血淸。　覩了這些被試驗的小動物，眞是又可愛又可憐，但它决沒料想到却眞正的爲了人類健康服務，可是據岸田說，這些小動物的飼料，也成了問題，一條牛日食七十五公斤，平均全部小動物需飼料合幣十萬餘元，也給士林支所一個難題。　　新專賣品　肺病藥有問題　　在研究所的辦公室裘，據陳博士的吿訴，各種疫苗預防注射液和血淸，除供給本省六百三十萬人需要以外，足可以供給國內華南·華東一帶使用。現在總所有六〇人，支所一七〇人，留用了十四位純技術的日籍專家，他們現在仍靜心地指導本省籍的助手工作着。這十四位，有可能的將於年終回國，在向國內徵聘專家以外，只有倚賴於從速的訓練了。陳博士堅决地說，人事上的困難是可望突破的，而經濟却是問題。一人份的鼠疫苗，痘苗的價格是台幣五角，治療用的血淸一萬單位一百元，這低廉的價格是不能作爲主要的自給政策的，即以修理本所被炸的部份而諭，値價的需六百萬元，而七百六十餘萬元的預算，也待於整個台灣大學經費的决定，因爲該所是屬於台大的。　　最後他又吿訴記者關於肺病特效藥的問題。决於下月間繼續硏究，因爲目前硏究還未能作爲定論。可是據記者所知，肺病特效藥已給專賣局作爲新的專賣品而開始製作着，這對於醫治大衆病而尙在硏究進程中的藥物，可能的發生兩個反响：其一是以賺錢爲目的；其二是說眞話賣假藥，葬送了已往硏究的苦心。站在醫學和人類的健康上，人們會反對這樣的專賣，忽視了救人的一般性，而成爲不盡妥善的貴族化的藥劑。深倍政府不致昧於有利可圖，而終能給予硏究者以鼓勵和保障的，因爲這硏究製作的成功，不只是台灣醫學界的光榮而已！　　記者將便吿國內讀者，一種假冒的肺病特效藥已在滬市發現，就是在液體以外有一種用丸片裝瓶的「使他肺安定」，台灣的醫學界都不使用，因爲化驗結果，不但不能治療，而且有副作用，危及生命，這是殺人藥劑！社會服務答復讀者　法律質疑　　（一）侵佔田產　　張華珍問先君於民國十四年，用存託管合同義據方式，向沈姓取得屋五間，地一畝的居住和承種權，合同上載明錢不取利，屋地均不輸租，十二年爲期，期滿回贖，到期後沈姓並未履的，於二十九年五月在敵僞勢力下，將地覇種，三十五年四月，乘鄙人不在家，擅將我家什物，閉禁一室，餘屋四間，盡行佔用，茲有疑問數點，請詳示：　　（一）此種合同義據，屬於何種性質（典質或租賃）？法律上有無保障？（二）法律如無保障，有無其他補救辦法？（三）沈姓先佔地，後佔屋，構成何罪？（四）定期十二年，過期九年，可否拒絕回贖？　　〔端木愷律師答〕（一）就字據名稱言係寄託契的就內容性質言係典權契的，（二）契的一經合法成立法律上當然應受保陣，（三）係侵害典權得訴求回復占有，（四）如無別種障碍得依民法第九百廿三條第二項辦理。　　（二）宗祧繼承　　魯芬問某甲於民國二十四年冬逝世，遺有一妻乙及一女丙，時甲母尙健在，堅欲以甲兄丁之　戊爲甲立嗣，乙雖不願，終以　姑有命，不敢峻拒，當時遂由　及丙聯名出具門狀，至於田畝　登記，田賦之完納等，皆未用　之名，三十年甲母病逝，其生前原已立有遺囑，將遺產妥爲分配，當時祗以未經見立人全體簽字，故未交與甲等兄弟分執，現此項遺囑已爲丁扣留，乙雖屢次　請遺囑執行人交涉，丁皆支吾　詞，延不交出，丁並賄賂遺囑執行人，帮同推延，抗戰期間，彼等共有之住宅爲敵僞鳩佔，後復縱火焚燒，幸未全燬，百餘間房屋之殘餘木料磚瓦，竟爲丁　機偸賣殆盡，以飽私囊，種種　　行爲，愈出愈奇，現乙丙衣食　着，請問（一）乙可取銷戊之嗣子身份而不給以甲之遺產吾？（二）乙對於其財產所有權之證明文件（如田房契等），一無所有。應如何補救？（三）乙於丁之侵吞應如何求得補償？　　〔端木愷律師答〕（一）宗祧繼承已因民法繼承編廿年五月五　施行而廢止嗣子在法律上已無身分，（二）產業憑證得請求占　者交還，（三）所受損害得請求賠償。慈善救濟　新裕一廠工友　移酬救難胞　　啓啟者：八月八日西蘇州路卅六號大有餘油廠失愼時，敝會一部份會員曾帮同灌救，事後由十三區第七保轉來該廠致送酬勞法幣四十萬元，惟敝會同人以救火乃應盡之義務，豈可受人酬報，爰將該款全數捐作救濟難民之用，而爲該廠同仁造福，除函謝該廠外，特將此款送請貴館轉送蘇北難民救濟協會，茲隨函奉上法幣四十萬元，請即檢收並煩査照辦理爲荷。此致申報館新裕一廠產業工會理事長葉洪風。司機同仁集款救災　　敬啓者：上海各界為蘇北同胞勸募救濟賑款，不遺餘力，殊爲欽佩，鄙社同仁爲善不敢後人，爰集得法幣二十五萬八千四百八十元正，送請　　貴報分神轉交蘇北難胞，明知杯水車薪，聊盡薄棉而已。此上敬頌撰祺銀色汽車司機聯盟社社長宦鴻昌謹啓啟蘇北難民損款　　中國興康燭廠產業工會仝人五十四萬元，棉紡業新裕一廠產業工會四十萬元，銀色汽車司機聯盟仝人二十五萬八千四百八十元，江海關港口消防隊十萬元（董傅田一萬元，劉益增，顧友良各六千，趙長海五千，陳義和，趙廣恩，楊德明，孫悅增，賀師模，李振甲，寗曉坡，陸士芳，顧金貴，金福根，周阿定，兪信利，陸阿寳，葉胃根，張長興，袁賜全，兪稅弟，韓阿龍，劉立周，雷子進各三千，

<p>春秋煩惱·人生·文學（夜讀隨筆）  沙里　　古希臘有一個神話：人類中的第一個女人，名字叫做潘朶卿（Pandora）的，和人類中的第一個男子名字叫做艾比米特（Epimetee）的結婚了，這簡直是天成的一對美　幸福的佳耦；當她們結婚的時候，愛神邱比特（Cupid）特爲鄭重地送給她們一件稀奇的禮物，那是一隻漂亮的匣子，並且誠懇地可囑她們：千萬不要打開它，永遠都不要把它打開。之後，她們爲慾望與好奇心所驅，終於忍不住冒險悄悄地把匣子揭開：誰會料到呢？那匣子裏關着的盡是災難，痛苦，疾病，死亡，貧窮，貪婪，嫉妒的孽種——它們都亡命地跳出匣子，往太空裏飛散，她們再也沒有方法能關回那稀奇的匣子；從此，人間便無孔不入無微弗至的遍佈了禍患跟煩惱……。　　打從有史可考的時候起，人類永遠是在跟煩惱作伴，怎麼也擺不脫；也打從有史可考的時候起，人類永遠在向煩惱抗爭，但怎麽也克服不了煩惱。世上人人都有煩惱，永遠有煩惱，絕對沒有一個例外。就彷彿煩惱必須是人生底一個重要因素似的。人們常常講，甚至高明的哲學家也說：人生便是煩惱，人類文化乃是煩惱的產品，人類史就是煩惱所組成的。　　本來嗎，人性是向上的，人類的慾望是永無止境的；因而，人生就永遠有煩惱。所存有的問題，祗是在或多或少上；越進步的人，煩惱必然越多，反過來說，煩惱越多的人，必然會越進步。人永遠在煩惱抗爭，也永遠在爲煩惱而奮鬥，永遠在爲煩惱而生活；因此，遂孵育了巨人，創造了偉事，寫下了悠長的人類史，產生了深遠的文化。　　不是麼？「多難興邦」，一時勢造英雄」「貧而後能工」，「物極必反」，都已經是近乎俗不可耐的道理了。這「多難」，「時勢」，「貧」，「極」，豈不是煩惱的形態；所以到了終極點就可「興邦」，成「英雄」。能「工」，必「反」。世上眞沒有煩惱的，祇有一種人，那就是死人；連白痴和垂死的人都不是。惟其如此，所以人扌會不斷的進步，所以扌有迎綿不絕的人類史，扌有與時俱展的文化。　　世上也有許多人在與煩惱鬥爭中感到無可奈何的時候，竟想採用快刀斬亂蔴的手段企圖一下子根除煩惱，而求得飄飄然的超脫。於是出現了些去智派，苦行派，禁欲派的哲人；還有認爲六根旣除就四大皆空的佛徒，他們以剃掉三千煩惱根的頭髮來表示他們對於煩惱的憎恨和剷除煩惱的決心，這來得更明朗而具體。但是，他們確實已經隔絕了煩惱麽？——誰能說哲人和佛徒們就眞的毫無煩惱？要想脫離煩惱，除了脫離人生就沒有別的法子。　　誠然，正惟人生便是煩惱，所以扌有高尙的人生；正惟文化乃是煩惱的產品，所以扌有　大的文化；正惟人類史就是煩惱所組成，所以扌有光輝的人類史。人間若果沒有煩惱，簡直就跟工業世界沒有煤和鐵一樣。　　蘇格拉底的呼籲正義，耶穌的宣揚福昔，釋迦牟尼的「我不入地獄誰入地獄」，孔子的「知其不可爲而爲」，趙匡胤的奔走天涯，以及歷史上許許多多成就武功政績或對人類有偉大供獻的人物，他們之所以成爲偉人，成就偉業，仔細分析，那個不是煩惱逼使的？就如像，世上最大的文學作品，又有那個不是煩惱造成的？　　文學作品，乃是紀錄人類史，表現文化，和反映人生最其體的東西；故而，文學作品乃是煩惱最具體的結晶。　　文學作品本是表達人底意志的一種工具，每一個文學作品，總是充份地表現了它的作者底主觀，這包括作者對於人生，歷史，時代，社會，道德，倫理，法律，信仰等等的看法和主張，無　作者怎樣儘力避免，但它總會有意或無意地給留下些痕跡的。作者是一個人，當然有其自己特殊的對事物的看法和主張，所以他有苦悶，有煩惱，所以他要發洩，所以寫成了文學作品，所以文學作品必是煩惱的結晶。廚川白村說的乾脆：凡是文藝作品，都是人類苦悶的象徵，假如沒有苦悶的地方，根本就不會有文藝作品了。　　但丁寫「神曲」，柏拉圖寫「理想國」，西萬提斯寫「唐·吉訶德」，莎士此亞寫「羅密歐與朱麗葉」歌德寫「浮士德」，易卜生寫「娜拉」，魯迅寫「在人日記」，曹雪芹寫「紅樓夢」，施耐菴寫「水滸」，高爾基寫「地下」，金聖嘆題「黃泉無旅店，今夜宿誰家？」的絕命詩，岳飛慨謌「莫等閒白了少年頭」，以至拜倫，普希金，李煜，杜甫，李白，陶潛的詩謌詞賦…………，仔細品味，亦莫不是煩惱的發洩，煩惱的結晶。　　人底墮落，上進，憎恨，戀愛，妥協，火拼，屈辱，革命，無一不是煩惱所致，其所以有高下之別，就在你怎樣這用煩惱；紀錄人底一切性格心情動態事蹟的文學作品，連僅僅是描寫靜物的作品都包括在內，無一不是煩惱結晶，其所以有優劣之分，就在你怎樣認識煩惱。愈能領受煩惱運川煩惱的人，愈能成爲偉人；愈能認識煩惱分析煩惱的人，愈能產生偉大的作品。　　人生便是煩惱，除非根本離開人生，你就無法隔絕煩惱，因爲沒有煩惱就沒有了人生。沒有煩惱，你就沒有文學作品。　　我們要努力在人生裏尋找煩憫，領受煩惱，抓住煩惱，　用煩惱，讓煩惱來促使我們進步，領導我們向前。我們要鑽進煩惱，認識煩惱，分析煩惱，體騐煩惱，讓煩惱來促使我們致力文學，領導我們學習文學。　　蘇格拉底，耶穌，釋迦牟尼，孔子，趙匡胤，他們的偉行，明明就是他們勇毅地自尋煩惱精神的表現。　　但丁，柏拉圖，西萬提斯，莎士比亞，歌德，易卜生，曹雪芹，施耐菴，……，他們的偉構，明明就是他們銳利深入煩惱力量的表現。　　我們決不企岡減少人類的煩惱，決不期望煩惱在人生裏滅跡，我們更決不相信——並且反對人間會有極榮世界或天堂到來；因爲那只會阻滯人類的進步，剝蝕人生底向上性，只會阻滯偉大文學作品產生，甚至會消滅文學的。讓我們親切地熱愛現實，讓我們勇毅銳利地前進吧。音樂語錄  馬超英　　和諧的曲調，有使人肉體和精神融合起來的效用。——莫里哀（Moliere）　　音樂的力量，是不可抵抗的，音樂的慈愛，是不可限定的。　　萊(Thackeay）　　讀數百卷道德書，其效力尙不及一曲音樂。——拿破崙（Napoleon）蛙聲  洪為法　　　　閣閣的蛙聲，在夜深人靜時，遠遠的聽去，似乎也另有一種韵味。南齊的孔稚珪當蛙聲做兩部數吹，自然是別有會心。不過聽得久了，那麽的單調，也會得使人感到厭惡。記得晋書的惠帝本紀上說：「帝嘗在華林園聞蝦蟆聲，問左右曰、此鳴者爲官乎？爲私乎？或對曰、在官地爲官，在私地爲私。」晋惠帝固是問得妙，左右更是答得妙。據水經注引晋中州記說，晋惠帝在當時還有「若官蝦蟆，可給　」的話。這些話看是說的癡愚，或者也就因爲他聽蛙聲閣閣不休，有些感到厭惡的原故。若是「爲官，」便是「官蝦蟆，可給　」了。那麽，若是「爲私」呢，儘是閣閣不休，總不能算是討人喜歡的事罷！　　南史的沈攸之傳上說：「攸之弟雍之孫僧昭，少事天師道士，自云爲太山錄事。中年爲山陰縣。梁武陵王紀爲會稽太守，宴坐池亭，蛙鳴聒耳。王曰、殊廢絲竹之聽。僧昭咒厭十許口，便患。及日晚，王又曰、欲其復鳴。佾昭曰、王歡已闌，今恣汝鳴。即便喧聒。」可惜我們不能如僧昭一樣，可以任意的支配蛙聲。吾則，愛聽就聽，感到厭惡不愛聽時，就使他一聲不響，這麽，說他是兩部鼓吹，原沒有什麼不可的。　　祗是艾子雜說上說：「艾子浮於海，夜泊島峙中。夜聞水下有人哭聲，復若人言，遂聽之。其言曰、昨日龍王有令，一應水族有尾者斬。吾　也，故懼誅而哭。汝蝦蟆無尾，何哭？復聞有言曰、吾今辛無尾，但恐更理會蝌蚪時事也。」這倒令人有些替蛙類担憂。如是現在也有所謂龍王之類，這龍王又竟下令斬有尾的水族。這會經有過尾巴的蛙類，除去希望龍王寬大爲懷，旣往不咎，那就難於避免災難的了。到了那時，不管他叫的爲官爲私，叫的聲音是否像鼓吹，便再也無人可以聽到蛙聲了。　　「此時無聲勝有聲！」在時時聽到蛙聲，厭惡蛙聲聒耳的人，如竟能不再聽到，該會都有這種感想罷！林間的流螢  葆文　　從酷熱的嚮午解脫出來，抹去一身的汗水，去迎接一個凉爽的夏夜，這是我暑期生活中每天意味到的感覺。　　距離我住的地方不遠的一條公路的轉角上，有一爿茶鋪子，茶舖子的前面躺着一片不疏不密的不知名的樹林，飯後，我總是跟幾個要好的朋友，一邊喫茶一邊談天，有時候，看看夜色中的田野，有時候仰望着一天繁星，淸雅冲淡的生活色調，不禁使我想起了竹林七賢式的隱居生涯。　　夏夜在凉爽的晚風里，顯得那末安閑，「夜來香」的歌詞，跳躍在雯的唇邊，我用無言的微笑，讚美這神秘的夜之歌。　　夏夜的美，可以讓我們展開稚氣的眼睛儘情地去捕捉它的奧秘的，允其是那一陣陣流螢的明滅，更使人眼光撩亂，迷戀　住。　　流螢閃閃地漫天飛舞，她想用她的光亮去燃點沉沉的夜色，她更想用她的光明去燃點這神秘的田園，就在這一明一滅的剎那，人們的心，早已爲她的一份光亮所所溶化了。　　隨着這一片閃閃的螢光，我們的視綫，無形中集中到這一陣林蔭里，這使我們更新奇地發現了更富有誘惑性的林間的流螢。　　我很難用這枝拙笨的筆來刻劃這林間的流螢的神情，她是那末一串串地掛滿了的，又是那朱一閃閃一陣陣地浮動着的，像銀花開遍枝頭，也像月光跳動在林間，像閃電透過雲層，更像煉爐里的加火花飛濺放射。　　那一閃一閃的光明，潛藏着生命的活力，它的跳動閃耀着年靑的光輝。　　我貪于着螢光點點漫天飛濺，更貪着那掛滿了林間的一串串的螢光——我的心向那是星之光波動着，是的，每一個年青人的心是向着光明的海洋流去的！鬥爭  法名雕刻家伊克作傳奇小說  子蓉　　——文藝術語誌一——　　　　英語爲Romance。在日本語裹，Romance與Nove都稱爲小說。其實這兩者却是略有差別的。Romance原爲中世紀羅馬人的「民族語」，是指通俗的小說而一言。到了近代，凡內容離奇複雜，或具有冒險性的，荒唐無稽不可思議的故事，都稱爲傳奇小說。例如「天路歷程」，「阿薩王的故事」，都是傳奇小說的好例子。桂冠詩人　　——文藝術語誌二——　　　英語爲Poet　Lureate，是由皇帝欽定的詩宗。在英國，由皇帝勅選了優秀的詩人，把桂冠戴在他的頭上，他在每年皇帝的誕辰作詩慶賀。這種名譽的詩人受到一般人的尊敬。例如華滋華斯和丁尼生等，都是桂冠詩人。一寸山河一寸血  葉勁風24　　「同年的八月」，我繼續說：「K君的令尊，把K君委託給一位日本女子名叫梅子的——據說是古君在長崎新納的小星，也就是K君的養母；人極賢慧，而且非常崇拜中國的革命志士——丟下了少數的幾個子，又替K君題名「承志」兩個字…」　　「哦，我明白了……KCC……古承志……每個拉丁文拼音的頭個字母！」w君眼中發出帶着笑意的一股奇光。　　「對哪」，我證實了他的發現；「K君的尊大人，把事情草草佈置了，我匆匆回國，同黃興等老一輩的同志們，在武昌起義。事業是成功了，可是古君因爲過分勞悴，得了急性的肺病，不到二三星期，也去世了。」　　「可敬，可惜！」w君一雙烏溜溜的濃眉，鎖攏起來，托出了內心的嘆息。　　「在臨危的當口，古君寫了一封長信給梅子，要她好生看顧承志。梅子收到　封信之後，也很努力的掙扎了一個時期。爲了生活實在支持不下去，就在東京嫁給一個叫鶴見淸的軍人，是中校階級，在軍部任職。因爲這一歲多的承志，十分可愛，鶴見夫妻特意到長崎給他改了國籍。　　「小學時代，我們是，同學，他七歲，我已經十五了。同時我們又是隣舍，所以往來很親密。……」說到這裏，我回憶到兒童時代的情景。我記得我告訴他，　見兩個字的日本發音，就是上海的「猪　」，「王」——他的名字　又是同華北的「她媽！」相近。我說他應該改名換姓；因爲他的姓和名却是駡人的詞句。我記得他當時很敏捷的回答，「你們　國話、差不多每個字都可以駡人。」他說他將來做了軍人，打到中國，第一件事就是取消中國語言。……　　「兩年之後，他轉了學——陸軍小學——我却回國在北平念書。民國十五年，我又到日本留學，進的是早稻田文學系，又碰着了他。那時他扌十五六歲，而體格和學識，却有些驚人的早成熟模樣。他說「你來日本我却要去中國了。」這一着是他的「父親」給他計劃的一着妙棋——表面是到同文書院學習中國方言，實際上是準備跳級的辦法……　　「是的」，w君插口說，「日本陸軍火學，升級極難，同文是個間諜實習所，民國十八年，我見過同文對我國的調査報吿，像偉氏字典那麼大的册子，已經出了八十多原本了。……想必是到同文弄個一二年。再圓到陸大，至少也可連升三級；可是得有大面子或實力的保舉」。　　「確實的……」。我點了點頭，「可是據說這一類的例子很少。大概，個人的扌具，却是重要的因素；否則毫無意義。我想承志的養父，正是看着他的天資過人，所以扌下了道一着棋。剛巧二十歲的那年，他就在陸大　業，跟手就派到「滿洲」派遣軍參諜總部實習……</p>

<h3>Supporting the Datong Front: National Army in Eastern Sui Begins Operations; Twelfth War Area Issues Statement Condemning Communist Troops for Breaking Faith; National Army in Rehe Reported to Have Entered Xifengkou</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Official confirmed news: The National Army in eastern Sui began operations on the 1st to support the Datong front. Significant progress has already been made. The front line of the Ping-Sui Railway entered Zishan yesterday. According to Air Force reconnaissance, the National Army made a sudden thrust from the northwest. The commander in that area is General Dong Qiwu. Another National Army force captured Liangcheng on the 4th. Personnel from the Gui-Sui supply station are scheduled to depart today to Ningtiao. A major battle is imminent. He Long's main force has been transferred from Datong to Ningtiao.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Du Yuming flew to Chengde on the morning of the 5th for inspection. The destruction within Chengde city is very severe, and the provincial government's relocation is still pending. It is also reported that the National Army entered Xifengkou on the morning of the 5th.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The National Army in eastern Hebei continued to recover Hetouying to the north of Funing and Shuangwangzhen to the west today, and is developing smoothly. Another National Army unit is advancing towards Yutian. National Army forces in the Gubeikou area reached a point ten li east of Gubeikou last night. More than 1,000 Communist troops attacked Zhangxinzhuang on the Ping-Gu Road all night last night, retreating at dawn.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 6th] According to local reports: Zhu De has arrived in Zhangjiakou to personally command the defense of Zhangjiakou. Other reports say Zhangjiakou is prepared to defend strongly. Several schools and factories in Zhangyuan have been evacuated, and the city has dug air raid shelters to protect against air force bombing. The Zhangjiakou radio station also said that it will soon be relocated. It also stated: even if the station is bombed, the CCP still has four radio stations in Longjiang, Andong, Harbin, and Yan'an.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Li Shijie, Chief of Staff of the Twelfth War Area, flew from Sui to Ping yesterday on a special plane. He met with Li Zongren that evening to report on the military situation in eastern Sui and Datong. He will fly to Guling soon to meet with Chairman Chiang and report on behalf of Fu Zuoyi.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] A spokesman for the headquarters of the Twelfth War Area officially declared in Gui-Sui on the 4th: The National Army of the war area will take all necessary actions to relieve Datong and rescue eastern Sui. The statement stated that the Communist troops had abandoned faith and righteousness, attacking Datong and ravaging eastern Sui. All peaceful efforts by the Twelfth War Area had failed. Recently, Zhou Beifeng was sent as a senior liaison officer to negotiate with the Communist troops to stop the attack on Datong, but it was also ineffective. It has now reached the point of utmost benevolence and righteousness, but the Communist troops are determined to cleanse Datong with blood. Therefore, all responsibilities arising from this should be borne by the Communist troops. It concluded by stating that the Twelfth War Area has the solemn responsibility to relieve Datong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] Military news reports that the overall commander of the Communist troops besieging Datong is Nie Rongzhen, who is stationed at Julepu. Below him are four forward command posts, each commanding the attack. Nie Rongzhen personally went to Sishilipu, east of the city, to convene a military meeting, setting a deadline of one week to capture Datong.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 6th] On the 4th, more than 20,000 Communist troops arrived in the Zhuozhou area from Zhangjiakou, posing a threat to the county seat. Also, a regiment of He Long's troops has crossed the Juma River northwest of Zhuozhou and stationed in Makongying. It is said that they will destroy the Ping-Han Railway and attack Zhuozhou.</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department's Chengde Group Missing After Being Straffed by Aircraft: Possible Conspiracy by the Communists</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The Military Mediation Department's 11th group stationed in Chengde encountered misfortune. This morning, the American side, based on a report from the Zhangjiakou group, notified the government that before the fall of Chengde, the group was moving to Weichang, when it reached a place thirteen miles south of Weichang, it was strafed by aircraft, killing or injuring four people. One of them was Li Zhengzi, a military police officer on the government side (seriously injured), and the two injured were an American translator (Chinese) and a radio technician. The whereabouts of the group are still unknown. According to the Communist side: as a result of the aircraft strafing, four people on the Communist side and two people on the American side died, and the number of injured personnel on the government side is unknown. The whereabouts of the group are still unknown, and they said they will lodge a protest. However, the government side stated that an investigation will be conducted to clarify the responsibility for this incident, but it is speculated that this may be a conspiracy by the Communist side. Since the National Army recovered Chengde after the Communist troops withdrew on their own initiative, and at the request of the people, it can be said that it was a bloodless takeover, and there was no need to use aircraft. It is heard that the Military Mediation Department has sent aircraft to Chengde to inquire about the whereabouts of the group, so that they can send aircraft to rescue and transport medical supplies.</p>

<p>Emerge and Disappear Unpredictably in Coastal Areas</p>

As for the direction of the decision, whether it is "yes" or "no," the Communist Party spokesman has not given a clear answer today, but he said that the future is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 6th] Special Envoy Marshall arrived in Guling for the seventh time at 8:00 p.m. on the 6th to spend the weekend, accompanied by several people including Military Advisor Pi Zonggan.

<h3>Marshall and Stuart Express Their Views: Agreement Must Be Sought to Reorganize the National Government Committee; Zhou Enlai Has Telegraphed Yan'an for Instructions</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 6th] It is learned that in order to make a final effort to break the deadlock, Marshall and Stuart have assured the Communist Party that if the Communist Party agrees to participate in the five-person group meeting, they will do their best to ensure that the government guarantees that a ceasefire order will be issued after an understanding is reached on the establishment of a reorganized National Government Committee. Marshall is trying to find out to what extent Chairman Chiang is prepared to accept the conditions of the Communist Party. It is thought that Chairman Chiang's conditions are to draw a line north of the Yangtze River to prevent the Communist Party from expanding its political, military, and land control beyond that line. Zhou Enlai has telegraphed Yan'an for instructions. Also, after meeting with Marshall on the 6th, Zhou went to the headquarters of the Democratic League to visit Liang Shuming and report on the development of the situation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] Special Envoy Marshall hurried to Guling to convey the attitude of the CCP to Chairman Chiang in the hope that the Chairman would clearly state the government's attitude towards a national ceasefire. Marshall, Stuart, and Zhou held a meeting for an hour and a half on the 6th. Zhou listened to the American side's views and telegraphed the CCP Politburo in Yan'an to consider the situation. The American side emphasized that at least an agreement must be sought on the establishment of a National Government Committee composed of various parties and factions. Zhou also stated that unless Chairman Chiang declares at what stage of the five-person group discussion a ceasefire order can be issued, the CCP is afraid that it will be unwilling to participate in any political discussions. There are now three ways forward: (1) Yan'an approves the American proposal for action in the coming weeks, so that Stuart can immediately convene a five-person group meeting; (2) Otherwise, Chairman Chiang can make a clear guarantee to the CCP through Marshall that a ceasefire order will be issued to meet Yan'an's requirements; (3) If the attempt by Marshall to climb Lushan and the Zhou Enlai telegram to Yan'an to consider the two options still fail, then the situation will remain in the current stalemate.</p>

<h3>Strategy for Suppressing Lake Bandits Decided: Organize Water Area Bandit Suppression Headquarters; Yang Yanbin Leads Troops to Surrender: Commander-in-Chief Tang Has Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 6th] Regarding the issue of suppressing bandits in Taihu Lake, no concrete action has been seen since the closing of the Jiangnan Security Conference. After synthesizing information from various sources, a reporter learned that the highest military authorities have decided on a strategy of suppression, which has been submitted to Chairman Chiang by Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army Tang Enbo for approval and implementation. A Taihu Lake Water Area Bandit Suppression Headquarters will soon be organized, with Lieutenant General Chen Daqing, Deputy Commander of the First Pacification Area, serving as commander. The location has been selected in Wuxi. The headquarters is authorized by the Ministry of National Defense to uniformly command the armies and local forces of various counties in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and to train a rapid water force. Recently, Commander Chen also telegraphed the three counties of Su, Xi, and Yu to requisition merchant ships and small boats privately owned by the people at high prices. The county has been ordered to requisition and hire multiple ships, which must be delivered to the Wuxi headquarters for application within a prescribed time limit.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local News] According to reliable news: Yang Yanbin, the bandit leader of Taihu Lake, resolutely led his troops to surrender to Commander-in-Chief Tang on the 3rd of this month and expressed his complete repentance. He vowed to eliminate the bandits in order to secure the public. Commander-in-Chief Tang approved his request, ordered him to recruit his old troops, suppress the stubborn bandits, and perform meritorious service to atone for his past sins, and appointed Mao Sen, director of the second department of the unit, to be responsible for supervising the work. It is heard that Yang's old troops, seeing Commander-in-Chief Tang's magnanimity and not blaming the past, are flocking to surrender. It is expected that the banditry in Taihu Lake will be pacified soon.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 6th] Taihu Lake is located in the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and can irrigate the Jiangnan Plain. However, due to the wide lake surface, bandits lurk there, and it is not peaceful. Recently, it has been heard that surplus puppet troops and ordinary gangsters have formed gangs of bandits, causing disturbances everywhere. The Zhejiang Provincial Security Authorities have submitted a request to Chairman Chiang, asking for the establishment of a pacification organization in that area to be responsible for suppressing banditry and ensuring security.</p>
<h3>Consolidating Security in Chengjiang Counties: Restrictions on Exported Goods</h3>

<h3>Discovery of Bandits in Suzhou: Conspiracy to Disturb the City</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 6th] At approximately 1 AM on the 4th, over thirty bandits were suddenly discovered gathering near the Shuangta area inside the Fengmen Gate in this county. All were carrying short guns, and their intentions were unclear. Local residents secretly reported this, and the city defense command rushed to encircle and capture them, but they had already disappeared. This demonstrates that the bandits are harboring a conspiracy to disturb the city of Suzhou. Military and police authorities are currently maintaining strict night-long vigilance and are conducting random, surprise household registration checks at all times.</p>
<h3>Hong Lanyou Inspects Anhui Disaster Areas</h3>

<h3>The Ministry of Social Affairs Emphasizes Law and Discipline</h3>
<p>Re-instructing Local Organizations to Abide by Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Social Affairs notes that recently, a small number of local organizations, either driven by righteous indignation or seeking solutions too hastily, have immediately taken action based on their proposals, inevitably deviating from standard procedures and failing to fully comply with legal norms. This is contrary to the government's commitment to respecting democracy and seeking the rule of law. Therefore, it is re-issuing a circular to social administrative agencies in all provinces and cities, instructing them to direct relevant authorities to report or denounce to the competent authorities or courts, in accordance with the law, any local social organizations or members thereof deemed to be involved in treachery or to be endangering local security, pending a ruling, to ensure compliance with laws and discipline.</p>
<h3>Aigleton Tells Reporters He Is Willing to Do His Best to Serve Us; UNRRA Work Review Meeting Held in Seven Groups Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] The newly appointed Director of the UNRRA China Office, Major General Aigleton, and Mr. Lei, the acting director who is about to return to the United States, held a press conference on the morning of the 6th. Aigleton expressed satisfaction with UNRRA's work and stated that he would do his best to ensure the shipment of supplies to China. He also mentioned that, during his time in Shanghai, he visited the docks and found that the situation there was not as "poor as imagined," as efforts were being made to transport the goods out after they arrived at the port. Aigleton spent most of the time discussing two issues: the shipment of UNRRA supplies to China and the supply of materials to Communist-held areas. Regarding the former, Aigleton believed that the embargo had little impact on China, as not all supplies were stopped after the embargo was issued, and he hinted that the embargo might be lifted. The key to this matter lies in transportation conditions. It is claimed that some of the suspended supplies are bulky equipment and some are due to transportation difficulties. Those that can be distributed immediately after receipt will continue to be shipped. Regarding whether the UNRRA relief program will be extended to the end of June next year, Aigleton believes that China's transportation is slow, and it may be difficult to complete the program before March next year, so an extension is possible. Foreign reporters were extremely concerned about the shipment of supplies to Communist-held areas. Aigleton stated that supplies to Communist areas are being shipped according to the original plan, and the distribution of relief supplies is not subject to political restrictions, but depends entirely on the needs of each region, with transportation being the main factor. However, there are also practical difficulties, and some supplies are too dangerous to be delivered. UNRRA personnel also announced two things at the press conference: one is that UNRRA has borrowed 8 million yuan from the Central Bank, and UNRRA has not subsidized its expenses; the other is that UNRRA is negotiating with the Executive Yuan to purchase some of the surplus supplies of the US military for relief purposes, which would save transportation tonnage and be beneficial to both parties.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] The UNRRA work review meeting was held in seven groups in the morning and afternoon of the 6th to discuss relief work, agricultural rehabilitation, industrial and mining rehabilitation, health facilities, distribution of materials, transportation, procurement, sales, utilization of foreign experts, and business connections between sub-bureaus. The third general meeting will be held on the morning of the 7th.</p>
<h3>Chennault and UNRRA to Sign Contract in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Air Transport of Relief Supplies in Accordance with the Law</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Regarding the matter of General Chennault signing a contract with UNRRA to transport relief supplies by air, the UNRRA spokesman here has confirmed this, but believes that the rumor that the contract is expected to be signed on the 7th is premature. UNRRA Director-General Chiang has been busy attending meetings these days, so even if Chennault comes to Nanjing from Shanghai, it will be difficult to sign this rather complicated contract on the 7th. In his observation, it is more likely that the contract will be signed in Shanghai. According to the contract, UNRRA will allocate equipment worth 3 million US dollars to Chennault. It is said that the organization Chennault has formed is a private company, which will initially have twelve aircraft operating. In addition to transporting UNRRA relief supplies, it may also transport some commercial goods. It is heard that the company's aircraft operating in our territory must obtain the approval of our government and must not violate international aviation regulations. The rumor that our national airspace will be undermined as a result is absolutely untrue.</p>
<h3>Total Number of UNRRA Ships Arriving in China Reaches 300</h3>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Democratic Socialist Party, formed by the merger of the National Socialist Party and the Overseas Democratic Constitutional Government Party, hosted reporters at the International Hotel yesterday. Over sixty people attended, including the party's leaders Zhang Junmai, Xu Fulin, Sun Baoyi, Jiang Yuntian, and reporters from various newspapers. Zhang Junmai began by reporting, stating briefly that he did not want to talk too much about the dangers of the current situation, but rather to make more efforts in practice. Like a house, he did not want to be a beautiful and eye-catching glass window, but would rather be a silently contributing foundation of three-in-one soil. Zhang then introduced Xu Fulin, who had traveled far to Nanyang due to party affairs, and invited him to express the party's views on the current situation. Xu stated that the Democratic Socialist Party will hold its founding congress in three months. After its establishment, its aspirations for national affairs are as follows: (1) China urgently needs peace now. The party advocates immediately stopping internal conflicts, laying a foundation for the rule of law, and engaging in construction. (2) Support unification. The military should belong to the state, not to any particular party or faction. In this way, the military will not be used as a tool for political disputes, and true national unification can be realized. (3) Demand democracy. Sovereignty should belong to all the people. True democracy is not the democracy of one party or one class. One should not use democracy as a slogan just because a certain party possesses the military. The people should be given sound knowledge through education, live in peace and work happily, and have ample food and clothing, and then participate in elections and freely choose the political party they support. (4) Realize a socialist political system. The party demands democracy in politics and advocates the implementation of socialism in economics, hence the name Democratic Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Then, Sun Baoyi expressed the party's four-point attitude towards the current situation: (1) Regarding the proposal to reorganize the government and establish a coalition government, it arose during the period of division between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Later, the resolutions established by the Political Consultative Conference aimed to unite the entire country. The party's aim since the War of Resistance is to support any government that is beneficial to unity. (2) Regarding the National Assembly, the party believes that whether the country is unified depends on whether the constitution is unified. The party is willing to support a unified constitution to promote a unified country. (3) Regarding the military reorganization plan, the party believes that whether the country is unified depends on whether the national defense forces are unified or divided. In the military reorganization plan, the ratio of the number of troops of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is one to five, which has been acknowledged by both sides. In the future, they should only discuss the location of troops and the method of mobilizing troops, and there is no need to argue about the gains and losses of one district or one place. (4) Peaceful unification is above all else. Chairman Chiang led the War of Resistance and national construction, and the party is very willing to support him, but hopes that the government will prioritize peaceful unification.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Unemployed in Italy Repatriated by Overseas Chinese Association</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] A group of unemployed overseas Chinese from Qingtian, Italy, have been gathered by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in the ports of Genoa and Naples and will be transported back to China on the "Maria Lo Run" ship, which previously transported German overseas Chinese from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Remittance Quotas for Overseas Chinese in British Territories Too Low</h3>
<p>Hoping the Government Will Negotiate with the British to Relax Restrictions</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Overseas Chinese are suffering greatly from the problem of overseas remittances. In British territories, each person can only remit 5 British pounds per month. In Singapore, the monthly remittance amount is 45 Straits dollars, which is only equivalent to 60,000 national currency. This amount is not enough to support the livelihoods of their families in the country. Overseas Chinese are eagerly hoping that the government will quickly negotiate with the British to seek reasonable adjustments.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 4th] Siam has relaxed its foreign exchange control measures. Chinese residents can now remit money back home for household expenses. The regulations stipulate that monthly remittances should not exceed 50 Siamese baht, which is approximately 12,500 national currency.</p>
<h3>Philippine Military Police Indiscriminately Arresting Overseas Chinese; Raiding Our Newspaper and Schools; Philippine Authorities Claim They Will Investigate</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 6th] The Philippine Military Police today continued to arrest large numbers of overseas Chinese and raided the Chinese Commercial News, sponsored by the Chinese Labor Union, and the primary school run by the Chinese YWCA. Eighteen employees of the Chinese Commercial News, including the publisher Guo Jimeng (transliteration), have been detained by the Philippine Military Police for questioning. Two primary school teachers and at least six labor union employees have also been arrested. Philippine President Roxas' Press Secretary, Farolan, announced that the matter would be investigated and stated that the Philippine government would issue a statement on the searches and arrests of overseas Chinese. According to the Guangfeng News, the searches and arrests were carried out on special orders from President Roxas. Philippine Interior Minister Quirante had solemnly announced a ban on the mass arrest of people without arrest warrants, or they would be subject to military law. Two hours after Quirante's order was issued, the Philippine Military Police arrested overseas Chinese. At the same time, President Roxas also ordered that no one be mistreated while detained, but today the Philippine Military Police actually struck people on the head with gun butts.</p>

<h3>US Surplus Supplies Given to China to Assist Our Economic Independence: Commentary from the Washington Star</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 5th] The Washington Star said in an editorial today that the agreement to transfer US non-military surplus property in the Pacific to China "has one basic objective: to assist all the people of China, regardless of their political affiliation, to restore their economic self-reliance, thereby gaining a better opportunity to complete their domestic unity and peace. Indeed, while such surplus property is not military equipment per se, some of it could be used to fight the Communists, but there is no such suspicion in the agreement with the National Government, for in fact it may take up to twenty-five months to complete the transfer of such property, and its distribution will be done as much as possible through China's normal commercial channels. In all respects, no matter what the Yenan Communists may say, this agreement seems quite sound, and the more reasonable assistance we give to China, the greater the help not only to China's interests, but also to the stability and peace of Asia and the world."</p>

Zhu's face changed color upon hearing the sentence and expressed his determination to appeal.</p>

<h3>People-to-People Diplomacy Between China and the United States</h3>
<p>In this time, nearing the Mid-Autumn Festival yet with lingering heat and humidity, we observe the visit of a delegation of U.S. Congressmen to China, and the journey of Professor Pei Fei for travel and lectures. The former, though members of the U.S. government, are congressmen who originate from the populace; rather than being considered government officials, it would be more accurate to call them representatives of the people. They truly are representatives of the people, and they are visiting China in that capacity. As for Professor Pei Fei, he is a scholar who holds no government position and has returned to China purely in a private capacity. In the relationship between countries, such private or people-to-people interactions are of utmost importance. Only when mutual understanding between people increases can international understanding be promoted, and international cooperation enhanced. Therefore, we welcome the arrival of these people's representatives and hope that people-to-people contact can become more frequent, to dispel prejudices and misunderstandings, and to enhance international understanding.</p>
<p>Professor Pei Fei, in his scholarly manner, refrained from making definitive judgments on the current political situation. In the receptions held by the cultural and journalistic circles of this city and the National Diplomacy Association in recent days, Professor Pei Fei pointed out several times at the tea parties: We should not overestimate the impact of international relations on the domestic situation, and that the China problem is ultimately a domestic problem, and we must seek solutions and foundations within ourselves. We admire this objective viewpoint, and every patriotic citizen should adopt this attitude. To turn domestic problems into international problems, or to follow the dictates of foreign powers on domestic issues, goes against the most basic requirements of nationalism. However, so-called domestic problems also differ in nature and cannot be generalized. For example, the Northeast problem should have been a purely domestic problem, but from the beginning, it has been shrouded in international relations—wasn't the fate of the Northeast predetermined by the unpleasant Yalta Conference? U.S. congressmen, during their visit to China, declared in Beiping the other day: "The United States' attitude towards the Soviet Union should become more forceful. ...The failure of negotiations to resolve the Chinese dispute is mostly attributable to Soviet influence. ...The Soviet Union is attempting to control all of China and is already in the process of doing so. Once successful, we can prepare to withdraw completely from the East. Since the United States is concerned about world peace, it cannot condone this situation...." This thorough observation seems to present an interesting contrast to Professor Pei Fei's reserved attitude.</p>
<p>Here, we want to point out: First, China takes the Three Principles of the People as the supreme guiding principle for nation-building. Under nationalism, if it is a purely domestic problem, we insist that we must seek solutions through our own efforts. Second, China suffered the most significant sacrifices and endured the longest period of hardship in World War II. We know how terrible war is; therefore, we have the greatest expectations for the establishment of lasting world peace. We are by no means a warlike nation, so we are extremely reluctant to see the outbreak of a third world war, which would subject mankind to even greater disaster. Having stated these two premises, we feel that as the Chinese situation has developed to its current stage, we are indeed ashamed of our lack of ability and insufficient effort. However, there has also been no shortage of situations where international relations have fueled the flames. The fundamental reason lies in the fact that the Communist Party is an international party. The central figures are Communists who have no difference in ideology or methods from Communists appearing elsewhere. They call themselves "democratic" and use the democratic traditions of democratic countries to enhance their position. The arrogance of the Chinese Communists today is partly due to the lack of understanding of the Chinese national conditions by people in advanced democratic countries. Therefore, the Chinese situation has always had some international relations involved from the beginning. After the CCP's position strengthened, they began to reveal their true colors. The CCP's anti-American propaganda and Moscow's anti-American rhetoric echo each other, as if prearranged. This is certainly not an accidental event.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the Chinese people, we dare to say that any method of indirectly supporting the Communist Party within China is not what the Chinese nation needs. The Chinese people need to live and work in peace and unity, but the CCP is expanding its military and launching wars everywhere, and its leaders openly declare plans for protracted warfare and attempts to form another government. Therefore, in the current situation, if we do not ask what the CCP's desires are, but simply adopt a policy of appeasement, we will inevitably continue the mistakes and failures of the past. We do not oppose "negotiations"; on the contrary, we would rather see the success of negotiations, but we must first ascertain whether the CCP has the sincerity to negotiate. For example, the incident of the Five-Man Group meeting these past few days, where the CCP went back on its word, is a prominent example that makes us unable to trust them. In this delicate international relationship, the wishes of the Chinese people are the same as those of the United States: they do not want another outbreak of a major war. To satisfy this wish, they should have a closer partnership. Some may hope to create a Chinese Tito, but the Chinese people are unwilling to sell out their country. We would like to ask authoritative writers like Professor Pei Fei: Since the Chinese problem is an internal problem of the Chinese people, is there anyone in the research-based countries still trying to support a Chinese Tito? This violates the wishes of the Chinese people, not to mention violating the principle of the Chinese people solving their internal problems themselves, and would also be a serious threat to world peace. What is needed at this time is for several major powers to have far-sighted and firm policies; and in the formation of these policies, there needs to be a mutual increase in understanding between peoples. In this sense, we welcome and hope for frequent contact between peoples; because only frequent contact between peoples can increase mutual understanding between peoples.</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Re-election of the Shanghai General Labor Union</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Labor Union held its fifth re-election of representatives. Hundreds of thousands of workers in Shanghai elected new leaders, no, new servants, from this conference. This is the first inspection of Shanghai's labor movement workers after the victory, and it can't be denied as a significant event in the history of the labor movement. First of all, we hope that these new leaders of the labor movement can properly lead the workers of Shanghai to a great road of hard work, national construction, improving workers' lives, and raising the status of labor. However, to lead the workers to this great road, we can't only rely on the labor union.</p>
<p>China doesn't need the communist theory of violent revolution, but China must implement the socialist theory of peaceful revolution; and this socialist theory of peaceful revolution, which has already been clarified in the teachings of the Founding Father, is the Principle of People's Livelihood. Therefore, the economic or social problems of China, are not the problems of whether or not we should implement the communist revolution through violence, but rather the problems of whether or not we are willing to practically promote the economic policies of the Principle of People's Livelihood. The responsibility of the Chinese Nationalist Party, the responsibility of the National Government, is extremely important and also extremely urgent today in its effort to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. If we can determine the economic policies we should adopt under the major premise of implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood, then the government will have a direction to follow when solving the labor-capital disputes and all the labor problems that everyone is anxious about at present, and it will also be able to handle them with ease. The Labor Party government of the United Kingdom after the war, at least on this point, can be worthy of emulation by our government. However, we must know that there must first be a Labor Party like that of the United Kingdom, before there can be a Labor Party government like that of the United Kingdom, and there must first be a Labor Party like that of the United Kingdom, before all the labor unions in the United Kingdom can support the Labor Party government of that country; furthermore, there must first be a Labor Party leader like that of the United Kingdom, before it can mobilize the laborers throughout the country to support the Labor Party's implementation of its policies in various labor unions. Therefore, the labor movement should not be taken lightly, and it cannot be done casually. First, there must be a party that firmly believes in its ideology; second, there must be leaders with both talent and virtue; and third, there must be union members with both national consciousness and democratic literacy. Only when all three are in place can we hope for a healthy labor movement.</p>
<p>The Chinese Nationalist Party should take the responsibility without reservation for guiding Chinese workers to take on the responsibility of national production through self-reliance. We don't need to shy away from saying that there must be many members of the Nationalist Party who are active in many labor unions in Shanghai, and at the same time, there must also be some members of the Communist Party and even members of other parties who are active. In the middle of competing with each other, everyone naturally wants to win the sympathy and support of the workers. But precisely because of this, we must pay attention to two points: First, labor movement cadres must be among the masses, living with the workers and sharing their joys and sorrows. If one is only in a position to regard oneself as a leader of the workers, but in reality has already become detached from the laboring masses, then the labor movement will never have hope. In particular, one cannot treat labor movement activists who approach the laboring masses as "reactionaries" simply because they do not approach the masses themselves, avoiding them for fear of getting too close and rejecting them for fear of not being able to control them. Otherwise, it will run counter to the purpose of awakening the masses to fight together, and the result will inevitably be driving the birds into the abyss. Not long ago, the sudden takeover of the Chongqing branch of the Chinese Labor Association inevitably had this kind of adverse effect. If the Nationalist Party has a more long-term vision, it should be aware of this! Second, labor movement cadres must actually serve the masses and lead the masses on the right path. Only faithful service can earn sincere faith; and only proper leadership can avoid the danger of straying from the right path. Often there are some people who are very short-sighted and have a very shallow understanding, thinking that the labor movement is first and foremost about pleasing the workers. Therefore, without asking what the workers are asking for, they are unwilling to support reckless actions, thinking that this is the only way to win the masses. In fact, the legitimate demands of the workers should be consistent with the demands of the nation and the people. If we disregard the overall requirements of the nation and the people and only see the local interests of the workers, we will inevitably be led astray. Taking the opportunity of the re-election of the Shanghai General Labor Union, we briefly state our views on the labor movement, and we sincerely hope that the Nationalist Party and the leaders of the labor movement will pay attention to them!</p>

<h3>U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes Advocates the Establishment of a Provisional German Government to Direct National Affairs Under Allied Control, Opposes Any Dismemberment of German Territory, and Declares That U.S. Troops Will Not Withdraw Until Security is Guaranteed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 6th (Broadcast): Byrnes delivered a speech in Stuttgart today. The main points are as follows: (1) Urging the Allied countries to facilitate the establishment of a provisional central German government in Germany as soon as possible; (2) The United States does not want to see Germany become a vassal of any strong country or group, nor does it want to see the Germans eking out a living under the rule of dictators (foreign or domestic); (3) The U.S. side has no intention of withdrawing its occupying forces from Germany.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 6th (Broadcast): U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a speech to the German people today, claiming that the United States advocates the unification of Germany and criticizing the Allied countries for their procrastination. The main points of Byrnes's speech are as follows: (1) The Allied countries should immediately propose the terms of the peace treaty that Germany is required to abide by; (2) Define Germany's borders; (3) Eliminate all barriers between the four occupation zones; (4) Achieve complete economic unification in the country; (5) Criticize the Control Council's dilatory policies.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Stuttgart, Germany, 6th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said in a speech here today, "The United States supports the early establishment of a German government in Germany, and the security occupying forces may have to stay in Germany for a long time. I do not want to be misunderstood. We will never shirk our responsibilities. We have not withdrawn, and if Germany needs occupying forces for a long time, the U.S. military will always be a part of the occupying forces." Byrnes delivered his speech to German and United Nations officials at the location of the temporary German government in this U.S. occupation zone. It is widely regarded as the most important foreign policy statement made by a U.S. politician after the war. To ensure security, the number of guards has been increased fourfold compared to usual.</p>
<p>Byrnes emphatically stated that the United States is determined to see Germany re-emerge as a peaceful country with group power. He rejected France's demands for the Rhineland and the Ruhr region, and warned Poland and the Soviet Union that the United States does not consider Germany's eastern border to be drawn along the Oder River. The land currently occupied by Poland and the Soviet Union is only "temporarily assigned" at Potsdam, and "the Potsdam Conference agreement stipulates that the heads of government will not support the cession of any special area when peacefully resolving issues." Byrnes urged the early establishment of a German central government, saying that the Four-Power Control Council is neither managing Germany nor allowing Germany to manage itself on many important issues. What the United Nations can and should do is to stipulate the rules that Germany can manage itself. The number of United Nations occupying forces should be limited, only sufficient to ensure that Germany obeys these rules. The U.S. government's opinion is that the provisional German government should not be selected by other countries' governments, but should be a German National Assembly, composed of democratically responsible officials from the provinces already established in the four occupation zones. The National Assembly, in addition to being subject to the reserved powers of the United Nations Control Council, should be responsible for promoting the proper work of the central administrative organs, and the central administrative organs should have full power to ensure that Germany becomes an economic unit, as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement.</p>
<h3>Britain Expresses Warm Approval</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 6th (Broadcast from London): Byrnes's speech in Stuttgart has been warmly approved by British officials, who share his view that the Polish administrative authorities in Germany are only a temporary government. They also agree with Byrnes's remarks on France. They said that the British government's goal is primarily to remove the economic difficulties in the British occupation zone, so that the people in the zone can be self-sufficient, because the current situation in the zone is creating a heavy burden for Britain.</p>
<h3>Economic Institutions in the British and American Occupation Zones of Germany to be Merged; A New Institution to be Established and Headed by Germans; Remarkable Achievements in the U.S. Occupation Zone</h3>
<p>[United Press, Dublin, 5th] The authorities in the U.S. and British occupation zones announced today that they have jointly reached an agreement consisting of four points, stipulating that the basic economic institutions in the U.S. and British occupation zones will be merged and a new institution will be established and headed by Germans. At the same time, the standard of living in the two zones will be made the same, and the ration quantities will also be unified. In addition, the economic resources in the two zones will be used jointly, and the same import and export trade policies will be adopted. However, it is said that there is no intention to merge the two zones politically.</p>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, Germany, 5th] General McNarny, commander of the U.S. occupying forces in Germany, issued a statement today praising the German autonomous government in the U.S. occupation zone, saying that it is not an exaggeration to say that Germany can be expected to become a respected member of the international community again. However, this only refers to the German government institutions in the U.S. occupation zone, which are more advanced than those in any other occupation zone. On the other hand, the political progress of the entire Germany is equal to zero. McNarny's remarks came on the eve of Secretary of State Byrnes's sudden visit to the U.S. occupation zone. McNarny also said that Byrnes will carefully study and clarify U.S. policy toward Germany, but declined to comment on the relationship between his remarks and the speech that Byrnes intends to deliver. McNarny listed the situation of the U.S. occupying forces as follows:</p>
<p>"Disarmament" As far as the German army is concerned, this has been completed, and military equipment is being dismantled according to plan.</p>
<p>"Reparations" Slightly behind schedule due to the inability to unify the German economy and the failure to determine Germany's future borders.</p>
<p>"Re-education" Proceeding smoothly, the youth training program is the most important mission to democratize Germany.</p>
<p>"　　" Proceeding according to plan.</p>
<p>"The repatriation and resettlement of refugees" "Far behind" schedule. Currently, an average of 1,100 Jews are sneaking into the U.S. occupation zone from Poland every day, causing problems with food and lodging. France has agreed to accommodate 5,000 Jewish refugees, the Czech Republic may accommodate 10,000, Italy can also accommodate 10,000, and Belgium can accommodate 1-2,000. All these proposals are conditional on not allowing the refugees to reside permanently.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Will Leave Paris and Return Home Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] According to reliable sources, Wang Shijie, the head of the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, will depart on the 8th and is expected to return to the capital on the 13th of this month. This trip is unrelated to the conclusion of the Paris Peace Conference, but is due to other important official duties that need to be handled in person. The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held in New York on the 23rd of this month, and the Chinese side needs to make various decisions, which is one of the reasons for Wang's return home.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 5th (Special Dispatch)] This afternoon, our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie hosted a banquet for 12 senior French officials at our embassy in France, including French President and Foreign Minister Bidault and French Constitutional Assembly Speaker Herriot.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Visits U.S. Naval Academy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] The U.S. Navy Department said that General He Yingqin, accompanied by his naval adjutant, visited the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland today, and was warmly received by the school's president.</p>
<h3>Bevin Presides Over Plenary Session of Peace Conference Yesterday; Half the Seats in the Venue are Vacant; Cacophony of Noise in the Subcommittees; Heated Debate on the Issue of Trieste's Affiliation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 6th (Broadcast): The plenary session of the Peace Conference was held at 2 p.m. today, presided over by Bevin. Half of the seats in the venue were vacant, and there were many representatives' seats with only one person attending. After the meeting began, Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamali spoke first.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 6th] Britain warned the Peace Conference today that if Trieste is not given a truly "international" free port status, Britain will withdraw from the Four-Power Agreement on the demarcation of the Venezia Giulia region. British representative McNeil said at the Peace Conference, first criticizing Yugoslavia's demand for a "special status" to manage Trieste, and then saying that if Trieste's independence is harmed, Britain will "reconsider the entire agreement." The British statement of this position is in response to the Slavic countries' demand for Yugoslavia to control Trieste.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 5th] The Peace Conference's Committee on Italian Territory and Politics recently met to discuss the most difficult issue of Trieste's affiliation. The representatives of all countries are aware of the danger of this issue and are all very careful, like smoking cigarettes next to a powder keg, and a slight carelessness is enough to cause a terrible disaster. First, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky spoke, refuting the arguments put forward by the Italian Prime Minister and Associate Prime Minister one by one, and said that the residents of Trieste and the Venezia Giulia region total one million people, two-thirds of whom are Slavs, and only some cities are Italian, but this region must be regarded as a whole and cannot be divided. If the region is ceded to Italy, Italy will inevitably develop eastward. As for the suggestion to internationalize the region, the result will only cause dissatisfaction among the countries. The memorandum submitted by the Southern countries is the most worthy of our attention. The committee then adjourned and will continue to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow, when representatives from Poland, Britain, France, and Ukraine will all express their opinions on this issue.</p>
<h3>Greece and Albania Present Reasons for Demands for Reparations from Italy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] The Italian Economic Committee met for 90 minutes tonight, causing a fierce dispute over whether to allow the Albanian representative to participate. Albania had formally applied previously, and Yugoslavia also supported it, but Greece opposed it. Soviet representative Arutyunyan vehemently opposed Greek interference, saying, "I sincerely do not understand why this simple etiquette question has been obstructed by Greece, and why it has fully vented its hatred and aggressive feelings toward that small country." The Soviet representative argued with the chairman for 50 minutes, and the chairman then proposed to put the matter to a vote, but the Soviet representative accused him of violating the law. For a time, only the sound of quarrels was heard, and other representatives also joined the debate, causing great disorder. At this point, the French representative explained the rules, that is, the Albanian representative may attend the committee to express his views and listen in on the debate, and the committee passed the case.</p>
<h3>Red-Faced Argument Over One Word; Military Committee Ends Unhappily</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 5th] At the meeting of the Peace Conference's Committee on Italian Military Affairs today, the representatives repeatedly debated the meaning of the word "goods" in the Treaty of Peace with Italy, and their faces turned red with anger. In the end, there was no definition. The Greek representative argued that "goods" meant "war materials," while the Ukrainian representative said that the compensation for Italy's seizure of war materials should be handled by the Reparations Committee. The British representative pointed out that "goods" included losses of property that could not be confirmed. Finally, it was decided to postpone the discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 5th (Associated Press)] Today, British and Soviet representatives attacked each other fiercely at the Peace Conference's Military Committee. At that time, the chairman, Polish representative Moser, stood up and left the venue, saying, "If you continue to argue, I can only leave the venue." After three hours of fruitless debate, the meeting made no progress. Moser said that he did not see any signs of compromise, so he decided to announce the adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 6th (Broadcast): The Balkan and Finnish Economic Committee continued to review Section 24 of Chapter 4 today, all of which are about Romania's reparations. The French delegation hopes that the Romanian delegation should be allowed to attend and express their opinions on the relevant issues.</p>
<h3>Ukraine Criticizes Britain and Greece; British Representative Forcefully Defends</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 5th] British representative Cadogan responded to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky's accusations against Britain and Greece in the Security Council, saying that Manuilsky had failed to present evidence, and even if he did, the Security Council has no direct responsibility for ethnic minorities. Gromyko said that Britain used British troops to interfere in Greece's labor unions. I feel that no one wants to attach importance to this accusation. Foreign Minister Bevin had previously invited the Soviet Union to participate in the Four-Power Committee to investigate the situation in Greece, but the Soviet Union did not accept it. The British army has a glorious record in Greece. The British army sacrificed countless lives to defend Greece months before the Soviet Union or Ukraine was forced to participate in the war. That armed intervention did delay Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union by many months. Cadogan went on to say that the United Nations Charter does not prohibit a member state from stationing troops in another member state, even if invited by that other member state. I would like to ask what the Soviet army was doing in Iran not long ago. Cadogan then raised two points: First, the current situation in Greece is no worse than that of some other European countries that have not been investigated by the Security Council. Second, if the Communist Party did not exert pressure and propaganda in Greece, the situation in Greece would be better. Greece's only request is to be allowed to act on its own. The original intention of the United Nations was that if countries have disputes, they should first seek to resolve them themselves, and if there is no result, they should apply to the Security Council. If a member state suddenly makes accusations and makes insulting remarks at the Security Council without any reason, the dignity of the Security Council will be lost, and the purpose of the United Nations organization will be lost.</p>
<h3>Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to be Held in Mid-October</h3>
<p>[TASS, Moscow, September 5th] The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has decided to postpone the second session of the Supreme Soviet from September 20th to October 15th.</p>
<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Convene Special Meeting: US Represented by Dunn to Discuss UN General Assembly Summoning</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 6th (Radio Broadcast): Due to the insistence of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Bidault suddenly convened a special meeting of the four major powers' foreign ministers at 4:00 PM today. The meeting will primarily focus on whether to postpone the UN General Assembly or convene it as scheduled in New York on September 23rd.</p>
<h3>Crossing the English Channel to Paris (Part 1): The Aroma of Coffee Thickens in the Capital of Art</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Xueyan</p>
<p>[Airmail from Paris, August 16th] It takes a total of nine and a half hours to travel from London to Paris by train, but a full four hours are spent crossing the sea, and the actual train journey is only five and a half hours. The English Channel is quite narrow between Dover and Calais, only about thirty miles. Digging a tunnel would not be difficult, and many people have suggested it, but such a convenient construction for travelers contains national defense risks. If the isolated three islands of Britain had such a shortcut connecting to the mainland, it would inevitably threaten the security of this island nation in the event of an emergency. Therefore, Britain would rather let those crossing the sea complain than lightly take this risk. The reporter must</p>
<p>go to Paris for business.</p>
<p>I left London by train at 9:20 AM and arrived in Dover at 11:00 AM to enter and exit the country. As usual, there was a set of procedures. More than two hundred people on the same train lined up to wait for passport and luggage inspections. The British are careful but not fussy, slow but very thorough. This is what the reporter has repeatedly realized since arriving in Britain, and this trip is another confirmation. If there are any outstanding advantages in the British national character, this should be the most important characteristic. The inspection procedures for more than two hundred people were completed within an hour and a half, and the ferry sailed around 11:30 AM. The English Channel is known for its wind and waves, so although the sea crossing only takes an hour and a half, most travelers regard it as a long journey. Few people who are not used to sailing can avoid seasickness and vomiting and pass safely. On the day the reporter crossed the sea, although the weather was clear and the wind was calm, the ship began to shake up and down as soon as it started, and I immediately felt dizzy and nauseous, feeling a little overwhelmed. But the British are indeed fond of sports and</p>
<p>a seafaring nation.</p>
<p>Despite the ship swaying and many passengers gradually turning pale, many were still unaffected. They not only did not find it difficult, but seemed to enjoy it. Young men and women rushed to the ship's rails to watch the waves move and see if anyone among their companions felt strange, taking it as a source of amusement. After enduring this hour and a half, we arrived in Calais, which is in France. At first glance, the most obvious impression for travelers is that the war damage is severe, and the wealth of the French people is far less than that of the British. Although London has also suffered from German bombing, and ruins can be seen everywhere in Britain, it is not as severe as in Calais, where entire areas within a few miles have been leveled. After the train left the station, for a long time, I still couldn't see complete houses, only damaged iron and steel lying on piles of tiles and rubble, which was unsettling to see.</p>
<p>On the French docks</p>
<p>The laborers who greet passengers, although generally clean and tidy, all wearing blue uniforms, are inevitably mixed with ragged people, unlike in Britain, where everyone is neatly dressed, and even beggars do not have obvious signs of poverty on the surface. And the number of workers is also far greater than at British docks, which also illustrates that Britain is richer than France. The British have few people and many jobs. Although there are also unemployed people, strictly speaking, they are not really without anything to do, but many British are unwilling to do jobs with low pay and difficult tasks, preferring to sit and wait for opportunities. It is said that many miners in Britain are Italians and Poles, because the British themselves are unwilling to work as miners, so in any situation, there is never a surplus of labor. The French docks cannot maintain this standard, so there is inevitably competition for business. Even if you are carrying a very small piece of luggage, there will always be several people</p>
<p>rushing up to offer their services</p>
<p>. On Chinese docks, there are always dozens of laborers for one passenger, swarming up like flies chasing carrion, desperately competing, as if they want to swallow the passenger in one gulp, which is naturally another matter. This is a characteristic of the intense competition for survival among Easterners. In addition, in terms of soliciting rewards, French laborers are far less elegant and generous than the British. They walk along carrying your suitcase, constantly asking you for a price: one shilling! Two shillings! Or thirty or fifty francs! They all compete fiercely! Conversely, British laborers mostly let you decide the price. If you are not excessive, they will never bargain with you. In fact, the people who pay the money are not stingy because of this. The British reputation for gentlemanly demeanor can indeed be confirmed in such subtle places, but the difference in wealth between the two countries is probably a more important practical reason.</p>
<h3>Unrest Continues in India: Deaths and Injuries Reach Thousands in Recent Days; Nehru to Broadcast Policy Explanation Today</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 6th (Radio Broadcast): The unrest in Mumbai and other places in India has intensified today, with deaths and injuries reaching one thousand, including 203 deaths, and more than two thousand arrests.</p>
<p>[United Press Mumbai, 5th] The Hindu-Muslim conflict did not ease today. A curfew was reimposed in most parts of Mumbai this evening. Since the 6th, at least two hundred people have been killed and six hundred injured. Sporadic bayonet attacks have claimed ten victims. At the same time, the police authorities conducted a large-scale search for troublemakers, and two thousand suspects have been arrested. After a bus driver and conductor were stabbed, the city's traffic was completely paralyzed, and most shops were closed. The government announced that if necessary, Mumbai would implement a continuous 24-hour prohibition order.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 5th] It is claimed that Indian Prime Minister Nehru will deliver a speech on the 7th of this month to explain the policies adopted by the interim government. It will be broadcast from Delhi Radio, once in Hindi at 8:30 PM and once in English at 8:45 PM. This is Nehru's first broadcast speech on Indian radio. At the same time, according to well-informed sources, the first reform to be undertaken by the interim government will be the abolition of the salt tax. This tax is considered by most Indians as a symbol of foreign rule. In fact, it is also a type of old tax, which was implemented by the Maurya Dynasty three hundred years before the Common Era, and was subsequently retained by Muslims and the British. The abolition of this tax will save each Indian one rupee per year.</p>
<h3>Greek Regent Resigns: Republican Democrats Recognize the Monarch</h3>
<p>[United Press Athens, 5th] Greek Regent Damaskinos submitted his resignation today after the results of the referendum were announced. It will be approved once King George II returns to the country.</p>
<p>[Reuters Athens, 5th] Former Prime Minister Panayiotis Kanellopoulos said today that his Republican Social Democratic Party will unconditionally recognize the monarch. The National Unity Party of Kanellopoulos has also made the same statement. Currently, the EAM Party, the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the People's Republican Party have not yet recognized the monarch.</p>
<h3>Where Do Rockets Come from in Greek Airspace?</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris came here to welcome King George back to the country. According to reports, mysterious rockets have been discovered in Greek airspace in the past few days. One was discovered over Thessaloniki Province, and several were discovered over Bacchus Province. It is reported that rockets have been seen frequently in Sweden and Norway in recent months, which are said to be launched from the Soviet-occupied zone in Germany.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations Stalled: The Crux of the Matter is the Sudan Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 6th (Radio Broadcast, Cairo): The "Al-Ahram" newspaper here commented: The Sudan issue is the main reason for the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations to stall, so we should pay special attention to the statement of Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha. Sidky Pasha said: The Egyptian delegation requested that Sudan be placed under the same rule as the Egyptian king. The British side need not fear this. We only ask to unite Egypt and Sudan, and there is no other desire for Sudan. The claim that the Sudanese people reject this alliance is completely inaccurate. After the Egyptian Prime Minister issued the above statement, he met with Azhari, the head of the Sudanese delegation. Although the Sudanese representatives do not have the right to participate in the negotiations, they have always maintained close contact with the Egyptian government.</p>
<h3>US Lease of Australian Bases Continues in Negotiations; Australian Prime Minister Says Bases Should be Provided to Britain</h3>
<p>[United Press Brisbane, Australia, 5th] Prime Minister Chifley told reporters tonight: Australia wants all important bases in the Pacific, no matter where they are, to be available to Britain, New Zealand, and Australia at all times. Negotiations continue on the issue of the United States leasing Manus Island and other Pacific island bases in Australia. It is extremely important for Pacific bases to be available to Britain, because the British mainland is vulnerable to destruction by modern weapons, so its future economic and defense strength must largely rely on the dominions.</p>
<h3>Palestine Issue: US Policy Remains Unchanged; London Conference Postponed to the 10th</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Paris, 6th (Radio Broadcast, London): The official opening date of the London Palestine Conference will be delayed by one day. Prime Minister Attlee's opening address on September 9th will also be changed to the 10th. Monday will be entirely spent on establishing contact between the representatives of the British government and the Arab representatives. The Jewish representatives will also likely decide to attend the conference.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] President Truman recently received reporters and made a statement saying that he will continue to strive to allow 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine. Representatives of the United States and Britain are currently negotiating in London to discuss this matter. As for the plan drafted by Grady and Morrison (advocating lending 300 million US dollars to the Arabs in exchange for the free immigration of Jews to Palestine), it is currently under review.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to return to London from Paris tomorrow afternoon or the day after tomorrow to study all documents related to the Palestine issue before the opening of the Palestine Conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters Cairo, 5th] Representatives of the Arab states have departed for London to attend the Palestine Conference. Azzam Pasha, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, has decided to attend in person. Alami, the former Secretary of the Palestinian Arab Party, has rejected the invitation from the British government and does not want to attend the London Conference.</p>
<h3>Humans Can Survive at Altitudes of Over 30,000 Feet Without Oxygen: Germans Used Jews for Experiments</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th (United Press)] The US Army Air Force has discovered a Nazi secret medical report. As a result of Nazi scientists conducting experiments on humans, it has been discovered that humans can survive at altitudes of 30,400 feet without oxygen. The test subjects were Jews or criminals. All the test subjects survived in the 30,400 feet of pressure of the experiment. Without oxygen, they would die if the pressure exceeded 33,600 feet. The report stated that in one experiment, Jews could maintain life for half an hour at 38,400 feet. These Jews died after the experiment, but their hearts continued to beat.</p>

<h3>LaGuardia Calls for the Establishment of a World Food Commission</h3>
<p>[United Press Danzig, 5th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia called here today for immediate action to establish a World Food Commission. Although the representatives of the countries agreed with Lai's speech, they were unwilling to express their views on Lai's so-called cancellation of the exchange. This plan may not be directly submitted to the meeting, but may be studied by a group designated by the Food and Agriculture Organization to consider the issue of organizing the World Food Commission. Lai should also invite the Soviet Union to join the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 5th] LaGuardia arrived here today from Copenhagen and took a plane back to New York this evening. Before leaving, he visited British Prime Minister Attlee.</p>
<h3>US Maritime Workers' Strike Surges: Shipowners Request Presidential Intervention</h3>

<h3>Increased Housing Rent to Begin in Autumn? Finance Bureau Plans New Methods to be Submitted to the Senate</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] A person in charge of the Finance Bureau said: The bureau is submitting new methods to the Municipal Senate for increasing the housing rent, that is, regardless of whether the rent is increased, the housing rent will be increased separately. According to the central laws and regulations, in principle, the housing rent is slightly collected based on the rent, but regardless of the rent, the Finance Bureau can determine the standard for collecting the housing rent. The current irrationality of this city is well known. As such, there is no reason for the housing rent to follow the rent again. Therefore, it is planned to implement new methods starting in the autumn, increasing from 14% to 20%. The collection will still maintain the grading system of one-fold for Grade A, two-fold for Grade B, and three-fold for Grade C, with progressive increases. For those in Grade A, the assessment will be tripled compared to the summer. After this method is implemented, the housing rent may be higher than the current rent, but the Finance Bureau believes that sound finances for the city must have reliable sources of revenue. And increasing the housing rent is the most appropriate method, for three reasons: (1) Housing rent is a direct tax and cannot be transferred or evaded, so it is the fairest. (2) The tax revenue is fixed. (3) The collection procedure is simple. If this proposal can be passed, then the housing rent in this city can be separated from the rent in the future, and the city's finances can also be stabilized. However, it is reported that the Finance Bureau's informal exchange of views with a few municipal senators has not resulted in their agreement to the proposal, but the Finance Bureau believes that this is the most basic method of opening up new sources of revenue and will definitely strive for it.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement Case: Accomplices Apprehended; Freight Escort of Jinpu Railway Sells Goods in Nanjing for More Than Ten Million; Four Criminals Flee North</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Details of the case of Feng Zhenbang, a freight escort on the Jinpu Railway, stealing twelve pieces of cotton cloth were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Jinpu Railway authorities, concerned about their responsibility, specially sent inspectors Sun Shuren and Li Guanghui to Shanghai to jointly investigate with the police departments of the two railways. The day before yesterday, late at night, accomplice Ma Yunqi (see photo) was arrested, and Ma confessed the details of the theft as follows:</p>
<p>The main culprits, Feng Zhenbang and Lei Guangrui (Feng is a freight escort, Lei is a staff member of the Xuzhou Luggage Room), were both former employees of the puppet "Hua Tie," and Ma introduced them both to "Hua Tie" at the time, so the relationship between the three was very close. In this theft plan, Feng had already discussed it with Chen Baichuan at Xuzhou Station when shipping the goods, and Lei Guangrui waited at Nanjing Station three days in advance. When Feng's car arrived in Nanjing, Lei used a forged "self-handled parcel ticket" to impersonate the owner and picked up twelve pieces of cotton cloth from the Nanjing Luggage Room. After Lei picked up the goods, he hired a horse-drawn carriage to transport them to the home of a friend named Tong. Feng then still escorted the remaining goods to Shanghai for delivery, claiming at the North Station that the remaining twelve pieces were being loaded and signed the "Delivery Certificate," so he fooled them at the time. After Feng delivered the goods, he hurriedly returned to Beijing and discussed the method of selling the stolen goods with Lei and Ma Yunqi in a room at the Dahua Hotel on Henan Road. He also invited Feng's classmates, the Yang Zaihuan and Yang Zaiyan brothers, to participate. It was decided to sell the stolen goods in three batches, totaling 12 million yuan (original value 30 million yuan). Ma knew that the first batch was sold to Nanjing Hongxing Cloth Store for more than 4 million yuan. The remaining two batches are still under investigation. Ma received 1 million yuan in stolen money.</p>
<p>After distributing the loot</p>
<p>Feng, Lei, Yang Zaihuan, Yang Zaiyan, and Ma Yunqi came to Shanghai together and rented rooms 14 and 16 at the Tongle Inn on Caishi Road. On the one hand, they registered under aliases at the Northeast Refugee Reception Center on Penglai Road to return to their hometowns. Feng, Lei, and the Yang brothers took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Chuan ship to Tianjin on the 2nd of this month. Ma remained in Shanghai because he had family members. Railway Bureau investigators believed that Feng and others were all from the Northeast and would definitely return to their hometowns after the incident, so they checked the refugee registration book at the Northeast Refugee Reception Center and found the names Feng Baozhen (Feng's alias) and Zhang Lie (Lei's alias). Both did not have photos, but the registered age and origin matched Feng and Lei. It was also learned that they claimed to have taken the entrance exam for Nanjing Central University but failed, so they were taking a detour back to their hometowns via Shanghai. The two Railway Bureau investigators, Sun and Li, felt that these two were suspicious. Based on the temporary addresses they filled out, they went to investigate with the Taishan Police Precinct and managed to capture Ma.</p>
<p>According to Ma's confession</p>
<p>he is 39 years old, and he used the 1 million yuan in stolen money he received to exchange for two gold bracelets at the Laotianbao Exchange in Beijing, one weighing one tael, five mace, and eight fen, and the other weighing one tael, four mace, and six fen, and a gold ring weighing three mace. After being interrogated by the Railway Bureau Police Department, Ma was escorted to Nanjing by Sun Shuren yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, accompanied by the owner of the goods, Chen Baichuan, to investigate the stolen goods. The four fugitives, Feng, Lei, and the Yang brothers, have been reported to Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places for arrest. The owner of the goods, Chen Baichuan, specially went to the North Station yesterday to express his gratitude to Station Master Tong. He was very grateful for the efforts of the police officers of the Jinpu authorities, who quickly solved the case.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Convenes Car Dealers to Explain New Traffic Measures</h3>
<p>Director Zhao Zengjue of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in order to improve traffic in the central district and implement measures that will be implemented starting on September 9th, convened representatives of the tricycle dealers' association to the bureau for a discussion on the 5th to prepare in advance. Yesterday, he convened representatives of the rickshaw dealers' association for a discussion, and personnel from the police bureau also participated. Director Zhao explained the points stipulated in the implementation measures to the car dealers in detail and accepted the opinions of the representatives, supplementing two points: (1) The original measures stipulated that all empty tricycles and empty rickshaws were prohibited from entering the central district from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Those that have already entered the central district with passengers should stop at designated parking locations. However, since the parking locations have limited capacity, the following was added to item 7 of the driving restrictions, "Should stop at designated parking locations," "or leave the central district via the nearest road," so that each car can handle it in this way when the parking locations are full. (2) The income of tricycles is slightly higher than that of rickshaws, so the penalty in item (D) is that tricycles and rickshaws will be fined 1,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan for each violation of the regulations. Rickshaws can be fined less than tricycles to show the distinction, and the police bureau will pay attention to the implementation. The car dealers and worker representatives understood this quite well.</p>
<h3>Numerous Deaths of Prisoners of War: Haskins Testifies to Japanese Atrocities</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The US military court continued to hear the case yesterday morning against Colonel Matsuda, the former director of the Changchun Prisoner of War Camp, and Captain Kawashima, the medical officer, for mistreating American prisoners of war. Haskins described the situation in the camp, saying that in terms of food, each meal consisted of only five ounces of bread and a very small amount of vegetables. Meat was never seen, and the degree of crudeness was even worse than dog food. Due to insufficient nutrition, lack of drinking water, coupled with the encroachment of wind and rain and exposure to the scorching sun, prisoners of war died one after another in the absence of medical treatment. In addition to this, the camp administrators, from Matsuda down, arbitrarily abused the prisoners of war. Anyone who did not comply was whipped and beaten. Those who violated camp regulations were often summarily executed. After Haskins finished speaking, the prosecutor submitted documents signed by the American officers who were captured at the time, describing the various atrocities they suffered, as well as photos of the graves of the dead prisoners of war taken on the hills outside Changchun, with more than 140 crosses in the picture.</p>
<h3>Wan Molin is Expected to be Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] It is reported that since Wan Molin was detained by the garrison command, his abdominal wound has recently flared up severely, and feces have been flowing out of the wound from time to time, which is quite serious. The warden of the prison, concerned about his responsibility, has reported the information to the commander. According to Article 114, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, if a detainee is ill to the point of life-threatening danger, he may be released on bail for medical treatment. Therefore, the Wan family's request for bail may be approved within days.</p>
<h3>British Ship to Arrive Today</h3>

The Loosman Changnan is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 11th, and the Buck President is scheduled to leave on the 12th to return to the United States.</p>
<h3>Various Prison Sentences: Jiang Jingyan, Lu Bingyuan, Li Zulai Continued Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of Li Zulai, the deputy manager of the puppet Central Bank of China, suspected of being a traitor, was heard again in the High Court yesterday afternoon. During the court's inquiry about the Fulai Qianzhuang (money shop), Li stated: "When the shop was first established, the total capital was 4 million in puppet currency, of which I only invested 20,000 in puppet currency. Later, the capital gradually increased, reaching 60 million in puppet currency by April of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945]. However, I personally did not continue to increase my investment, remaining only with the initial 20,000 in puppet currency, which led to the loss of my qualification as a director. Later, the shop was reorganized, and I also left after April of the 34th year. I am not aware of what happened afterward. When I was responsible as the chairman, the business was losing money, so I wanted to reorganize it. I was not aware of the matter of lending money at an interest rate of 18%, and there was no speculation or manipulation at all. Other investments in more than a dozen money shops were only small amounts of 2,000 or 3,000 in puppet currency, and I did not hold any position." The defendant also retained three lawyers, Duan Tai Kai, Zuo De, and Shan Yu Hua, for defense. Li also requested the court to inquire with Du Yuesheng, Wan Molin, and others whether the defendant had any relationship with the central government in the past eight years. The court replied that it was not necessary, as the investigation was very detailed. Subsequently, Lu Bingyuan, a staff member of the Fulai Qianzhuang, was brought to court to inquire about the inside information of the shop in great detail. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<p>In addition, the cases of Chen Yongkang, a special high section detective of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, Wang Shouqing, the head of the fifth bao of the fourth district of the puppet Shanghai Maritime Baojia, and Cai A'gen, etc., were all adjourned for further hearing after witnesses were summoned and investigations were conducted.</p>
<p>On the same day, two cases were pronounced: Jiang Jingyan was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and Lu Bingyuan was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>The cases of Wang Wei, the head of the fifteenth bao of the puppet Longhua Town, Zhou Wenrui, Liu Zhaoding, etc., were concluded yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 13th of this month. In addition, the High Prosecutor's Office filed a lawsuit against La Jie on suspicion of being a traitor.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Congress of the General Labor Union Elected 54 Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Fifth Congress of the Municipal General Labor Union was held yesterday morning at the Ningbo Native Place Association. More than 400 representatives from 224 affiliated labor unions attended. Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Shui Xiangyun, Fang Rusheng, Lin Chunting, and Zhang Jindi were elected as the presidium. First, Zhou Xuexiang reported on the work of the past year and stated that at this critical stage, the labor community should recognize its position, focus on construction, understand the times, distinguish right from wrong, and strive for workers' welfare and protection through reasonable and legal means. He hoped that all workers in the city would work together to complete economic construction. Next, Pan Gongzhan, the Speaker of the Municipal Consultative Council, delivered a speech, stating that workers have achieved stability amidst difficulties and hardships, partly due to the appropriate handling by the responsible authorities and partly due to the correct understanding of the labor community. Currently, attention should be paid to improving the lives of workers, but also to the recovery and development of the fragile industrial sector. He also hoped for: (1) increased industrial production, (2) substantial progress in the labor community under the leadership of directors and supervisors, and (3) firm belief in the Three Principles of the People and the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Subsequently, Lu Jingshi, a representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs, delivered a speech, stating that the improved status of labor and the freedom of labor union organization are good phenomena for the labor movement. The quality of labor union directors and supervisors is closely related to the success or failure of the labor movement.

Li Jianhua, the Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated that organizing labor unions is not only for struggle but also has educational significance. The demands of the country and the conditions of the times should be understood. Finally, Tian Heqing, a representative of the China Industrial Association Shanghai Branch, an organization of employers, spoke, advocating labor-management cooperation, establishing industrial peace, and striving for production. Representatives from labor unions in Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places also delivered speeches. The congress adjourned at 12:00 noon.

<h3>Pei Fei Talks about Post-War China: Not Receiving Deserved Rewards; Yan Huiqing and Others Attended a Welcome Reception by the Diplomatic Association and Gave Speeches</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Professor Pei Fei, an expert on Far Eastern affairs from the United States, has been invited to Shanghai and has been warmly welcomed by all sectors. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese National Diplomatic Association held a banquet in honor of Professor Pei Fei at the International Hotel on the third floor yesterday afternoon. Yan Huiqing, Xi Yushu, Chang Chenguolian, Wang Zhuyi, Zhu Xuefan, Zhang Peter, Li Ximou, Wang Weiyin, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Association, and Zhang Xianglin, the former Chinese Consul General in New York, and others, a total of forty people, attended. First, Xi Yushu, the chairman, delivered a welcome speech. Professor Pei Fei then gave a speech, stating: "Most of you present today are deeply involved in diplomatic research. With Dr. Yan Huiqing in attendance, I feel like I am showing off my skills before an expert. The meaning of diplomacy can be said to be peace or war, but it is often a disaster. Diplomacy is the exchange of ideas, beliefs, cultures, and concepts between different peoples. Therefore, I believe that if there were no diplomatic problems in the world, humanity might be happier. In a short period of time, we have encountered two world wars and learned profound lessons. But we must recognize that the year after a major war is the most difficult period for any country. Other situations are worse than during the war, except for the reduction in killings. We must make our best efforts to deeply study the crux of various disasters to alleviate human suffering."</p>

<h3>Site of the Congress: Yiyuan</h3>
<p>(Our Dispatch) The site of the first Municipal Consultative Council of this city was originally scheduled to be held at the former German school on Daxi Road. However, because the terrain there is too low, it will be affected by heavy rain. At the same time, the venue is small and not enough to accommodate everyone. Therefore, the Municipal Consultative Council decided to change it to the Yiyuan Hotel on Shaanxi Road, which can accommodate 600 seats. The arrangement of the venue is planned as follows: in the center of the hall, facing the rostrum, there will be six rows of seats for councilors, with sixteen seats in each row. On the left and right sides, there will be forty-two seats each. Record seats will be set up on the left and right sides, and sixteen seats each will be set up on the left and right sides for municipal government personnel to attend. The outer circle of the councilor seats will be for reporters and guests. The corridor on the second floor of the hall will also have a gallery. The association stipulates that each councilor will be issued one gallery pass for relatives and friends to attend. The issue of alternate councilors attending the meeting is still pending decision by the Ministry of the Interior. Gallery passes are temporarily prepared, and those who wish to participate can go to collect them. In addition to the amplifier on the rostrum, another one is prepared for councilors to speak. The Consultative Council will require Yiyuan Hotel to move the tables and chairs in and out every day, as the hotel still needs to operate at night, so it is not planned to decorate the venue much. The bleachers outside the venue are intended to be used for rest and will be supplied with snacks and refreshments by Yiyuan Hotel, with prices at least double the market price.</p>
<h3>Nearly Two Hundred Proposals Received</h3>
<p>In addition, the Municipal Consultative Council has received nearly two hundred proposals as of yesterday. In addition to the horse racing case, the mayor has submitted several proposals on financial donations and taxes.

<h3>Xi Yushu Resigns as Councilor; Wang Xiaolai Considering Whether to Accept or Decline</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Among the councilors of this city, Tao Baichuan, Wang Xiaolai, Xi Yushu, and Duanmu Kai are also members of the National Consultative Council. However, according to central regulations, members of the National Consultative Council cannot concurrently serve as councilors of the Municipal Consultative Council. Currently, Tao and Duanmu have formally submitted their resignations to the Municipal Consultative Council, Xi has decided to resign from the National Consultative Council and serve as a councilor of the Municipal Consultative Council, and Wang Xiaolai is still considering whether to accept or decline.</p>
<p>In addition, the successors to the councilor positions should be decided by the Municipal Consultative Council according to the organizational regulations. The election of alternate councilors in this city is currently scheduled to be held at the first congress on the morning of the 9th of this month. It is said that there are many enthusiastic candidates for councilor, including Ms. Jin Zhenyu, the wife of Xi Yushu, from the women's sector.</p>
<h3>Alternate Councilors Establish Friendship Association</h3>
<p>Previously, the alternate councilors of this city, in order to strive for obligations, initiated the organization of a friendship association by Wang Zhimu, Yang Zhiqian, Yin Yong, and Wang Yangzhen, etc. The preparation has been going on for more than a month. The association convened a friendship congress at the New Life Club the other day, with 112 alternate councilors attending. Wang Zhiben, Yang Zhiqian, Li Baosen, Wei Yunong, and Xie Dahuang were elected as the presidium. Wang Zhiben, Zhi</p>
<p>Dr. Yan Huiqing immediately stood up and said: "Thirteen years ago, at the League of Nations, I loudly called for the Manchurian problem to be resolved, otherwise we would have a second world war. At the time, no one believed me or paid attention. Six years ago, I traveled to various places at home and abroad and had already encountered countries preparing for war. Therefore, the United Nations hoped that the United States would lead the war. As a result, the United States was indeed able to lead and complete the mission of victory. The Chinese people need to have a deeper understanding of diplomatic issues, even of China's own issues. Professor Pei Fei has extensive research on international issues and a clear understanding of Chinese issues, which is unmatched by most people in our country. As the saying goes, 'The bystander sees the game best.' Professor Pei Fei will surely tell us with sincerity and frankness what the people of the world think of China, so that we can recognize the path we should take in the future and not be blinded."</p>
<p>When asked what attitude the Chinese people should take to observe the current situation, Mr. Pei expressed that he was unable to answer, but said that the Chinese should neither be advised by foreigners nor accept the advice of foreigners. However, it should be recognized that the current war is not the war of the 18th or 19th century, nor is it an internal war like the era of Zhang Zuolin and Feng Yuxiang. The overall situation should be studied with a general mentality.</p>
<p>Also asked: To what extent will the United States, in its international leadership position, be prepared to maintain its presence in the Far East? Mr. Pei replied that he could not speak on behalf of the US government, but in his personal opinion, the United States does not want to be a leader, and does not hope that [the] country [will] do this, but the United States will take on its due share of responsibility and do its best for world peace. Finally, Mr. Pei responded to Mr. Xi Yushu's question, "What do the general public in [the] country think of [the] country?", saying with emotion: "China has passed an era. This time when I returned to China, I found that China did not receive the rewards it deserved after eight years of hard fighting. I was quite disappointed with the impression I got."</p>

The patrol officer from the Luxiangyuan Road police station took the injured to the hospital and brought the drivers Chen Aqing and Jiang Shuji to the station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Stolen Money from the Rong Case Returned in a Handbag and Suitcase: 50,000 US Dollars as Reward for Director Mao and Subordinates; Gold Jewelry and Other Items May Be Returned to the Kidnappers' Families</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The stolen money recovered in the Rong Desheng kidnapping case was collected yesterday by Rong Dexin, a relative of Rong, and Xu Banggui, a staff member, at 3:50 PM from the Garrison Command. After all the US dollars, legal tender, and gold were counted in the office of the Chief of Military Justice, Rong Dexin signed and stamped the receipt and packed them fully in a small suitcase and canvas handbag that he brought with him. Before leaving, he said to Director Zeng, "I am very grateful for the efforts of the military and police agencies in solving the kidnapping case of Mr. Rong. A reward will be given to those who contributed to the effort, which will be decided after consulting Commander Xuan." When asked by reporters how the recovered stolen money would be disposed of, it was said that "in addition to a portion to reward the military and police personnel, the remaining amount will be donated to charity." Rong and others then took the money downstairs and left fully loaded in their own blue car number "11159." It was already 5:35 PM.</p>
<p>In addition to the portion of the stolen money recovered by the police bureau, which was reported yesterday, the Inspection Office of the Garrison Command handed over US$27,345 (including US$8,910 submitted by the First Pacification Zone), 98,115,200 legal tender, and 332 taels, 9 mace, 2 fen, and 8 liang of gold. The First Pacification Zone originally recovered US$58,910, 1,061,380 legal tender, and 119 taels and 9 fen of gold buttons. However, because Chairman's handwritten instructions were received to reward Director Mao Sen and his subordinates with US$50,000, and the amount of US$13,000 for the car purchased by Wu Zhigang, the remaining amount was only US$8,190, which was transferred to the police command. Therefore, what Rong Desheng's family actually recovered yesterday was US$94,745, 100,271,520 legal tender, and 332 taels, 9 mace, 2 fen, and 8 liang of gold. As for the gold jewelry, watches, and other items, they are temporarily held by the Military Justice Office and may be returned to the families of the kidnappers.</p>

<h3>Colonel of the Naval Fleet Command Secretly Accused of Embezzlement in Reception; Involved Stores Deny Investigation; Investigation Team Tracing Original Inventory List from the Processing Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Recently, someone sent a letter to the investigation team, secretly accusing Chen Yongqin, a current colonel of the Naval Fleet Command, who was responsible for receiving enemy and puppet Yangshupu warehouses, of using his power to seize civilian vehicles and steal warehouse materials, such as gasoline, wool, rice, sugar, soap, and hardware. Later, he used trucks to steal large quantities, colluding with his fellow townsmen Chi Hualong and Ruan, secretly selling them. After the investigation team arrived in Shanghai, they hurriedly sold off the stolen materials. The Camel Store on Ying Shi Road had purchased the stolen daily necessities. The secret report also stated that Chen Yongqin had lived in Shanghai since the outbreak of the 813 Shanghai Battle and had colluded with Ruan to work for the enemy.</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, the investigation team immediately sent people to the Camel Store and Chi Hualong's residence for investigation, but all parties denied the above situation. After collecting the customs reception inventory for verification, it was difficult to verify which of the Yangshupu warehouse reception inventories were sent by Chen Yongqin. Therefore, the investigation team sent a letter to the Processing Bureau for inquiry. Based on the index of the Customs' Gonghexing Warehouse Inventory List of the China Merchants Bureau compiled by the Customs, it was learned that there were no original inventory lists for items numbered 15, 16, 34, 35, 37, 137, 139, 201, 202, 349, 385, 488, 493, and 515 in the Customs inventory numbers.</p>
<p>Further investigation revealed that in the comparison table of cargo inventory from the Jianghai Customs reception inventory and the enemy's original inventory, there were cargos listed in the Customs inventory but not listed in the enemy's original transfer inventory. There were cargos in the Customs inventory that were more than those in the enemy's original inventory. There were cargos in the Customs inventory that were less than those in the enemy's original inventory. Regarding the investigation of this case, the investigation team is tracing the original inventory from the Enemy-Puppet Property Processing Bureau to clarify the truth.</p>

<h3>Distribution of Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>1.  3 Million Allotted As Applied For, For 581</p>
<p>Fourth Time Totaling Over 11,000 Allotted</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Yarn Mill Joint Distribution Committee held its fifth meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Wang Qiyu (China Textile), Guo Dihuo (Wing On), Wu Meijing (Textile Construction), Tong Runfu (New Yu), and Rong Yixin (Shen Xin) were present. Tang Xinghai of Baofeng Yarn Mill was absent. Wang Zijian of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Yang Xiren (Liu Wenteng representing) of the Textile Industry Management Committee were present as observers. Three matters were discussed and decided: (1) The standard amount of 20-count cotton yarn for sale was 581 and a half pieces, and it was fully allocated according to the amount applied for. (2) The selling price was set at 1.3 million yuan per piece (400 pounds) for 20-count Double Horse yarn (another 20,000 yuan lower than the previous allocation). (3) The next sale date was set for September 9th.</p>
<p>It is reported that the committee has held four yarn sales since its establishment. The first sale was for 4,695 pieces, the second for 5,045 pieces, the third for 881 pieces, and the fourth, which was the sale yesterday, was for 581.5 pieces.

<p>*   Textile Construction Cloth Prices Remain Stable</p>
<p>*   Fine Cloth Supply Still Tight</p>
<p>The market price of yarn and cloth, and the quoted price of Textile Construction, remain fixed at the original price. The black market and the listed price are gradually approaching each other. The "Four Gentlemen" wool fabric opened by Textile Construction the day before yesterday was priced at 56,000 yuan. In the early market yesterday, some people holding notification slips were willing to sell them for 300 yuan and 500 yuan. Around 10:00 AM, the Hankou merchants absorbed a little, raising the price to 500 yuan to 700 yuan to buy in. By noon, some were willing to offer 1,000 yuan, but the spot price was still 58,000 to 8,500 yuan. The fine V-shaped blue cloth, opened by Textile Construction at 55,000 yuan, had buyers in the market offering 2,000 yuan to buy in notification slips, indicating that the supply of fine cloth is still tight. However, it has fallen sharply by 6,000 yuan compared to the peak. The dyeing and weaving factories in this city have previously set out a large amount of Guangbang colored cloth. Recently, due to government restrictions on exports, the price has fallen downstream, and Guangbang has also cited restrictions as an excuse to request returns.</p>

<p>*   Dyeing And Weaving Industry Hit Hard</p>
<p>The trade with Guangbang is a major outlet for the factories in this city. The factories prepare their goods to cater to Guangbang's preferences for patterns and colors. Now, with the restrictions on exports, the dyeing and weaving industry has been hit hard. In this autumn when the reproduction industry is struggling to survive, it has encountered more difficulties. According to Mr. Wang Zijian of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' cotton spinning department, Shanghai cotton yarn, in addition to meeting the needs of this city, has South China as its only sales destination. Although there are no statistics on the actual quantity needed in South China, the amount bought by Guangbang and actually used in the various provinces of South China is probably not small. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the government should conduct research on export restrictions.</p>
<h3>Abundant Share of Yarn Prices Rise</h3>
<p>*   The Year's Harvest Sells At Special Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market had already turned stable. The Cantonese merchants' dumping of Double Horse was no longer seen, and colleagues took the opportunity to absorb the cheap yarn. Therefore, special Double Horse reappeared at the 1.5 million mark. Small and medium-sized yarns were favored by inland merchants, and prices also rose by 12,000 yuan. The Abundant Harvest and Water Moon brands were particularly scarce, because Textile Construction had not allocated them to yarn merchants for two weeks. In the morning at 10:00 AM, Textile Construction Company listed 20-count yarn for sale, with only the Blue Phoenix brand, and only the Li Ma short tube for 42-count yarn, with no large packages for sale. Therefore, the market price of double-stranded yarn increased by 45,000 yuan due to [blank]. 42-count Blue Phoenix was asking for 2.18 million yuan, and 20-count Blue Phoenix was asking for 1.334 million yuan, but there were very few transactions. The 40-count Silver Moon, which had no buyers during the week, had slight transactions yesterday, and the price also rose to 1.88 million yuan. Qingdao goods Fengdao were sold for 1.87 million yuan. According to people in the industry, the sluggish prices of yarn and cloth are due to the government's intention to suppress prices, the cooperation of various cotton products associations, state-owned and private manufacturers in selling at affordable prices, and the continued tightening of silver funds. In addition, the merchants' purchase of goods is complicated by loading, remittance, and other procedures, which take a long time, and the turnover of goods and funds is stagnant, which reduces purchasing power. This is also a major reason.</p>
<p>*   Chinese and Foreign Stocks Remain Stable</p>
<p>There were not many transactions in Chinese stocks. The market opened flat and then stabilized, still affected by silver funds. The opening prices of the stocks in the morning were not good, and the closing prices from the day before remained fixed. Later, as silver funds eased, the stocks gradually rose.

The increase in Yeguang and Jardine Matheson was limited. Asia reported a slight setback.</p>

<h3>Admission Quotas for Publicly and Privately Funded Students Studying Abroad: To be Approved and Announced at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing] The exam papers of this year's publicly and privately funded students studying abroad, after being reviewed by experts invited by the Ministry of Education, are expected to be announced before mid-September. Upon inquiring with the director in charge, it was stated that because there were too many exam papers, it was necessary to wait for all the experts to complete their reviews and submit them. For the sake of prudence, a meeting must be held to approve the admitted students, and at the same time, the seals must be opened. After all the procedures are completed, the admission quotas can be announced as early as the end of September. Because the publicly funded students need the Ministry of Education to contact foreign schools, the departure for abroad will be later than the privately funded students.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Promotes National Education: The Department of Education Specifically Organizes a Guidance Committee</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang] Promoting national education is a major focus of the Jiangsu Department of Education's implementation plan for this year. According to Shi Renfu, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Department of Education, the national education promotion plan for this year has been largely decided upon at the recent meeting of educational administrators in southern Jiangsu. In the first year, an average of one central national school will be established in every two townships, and one national school will be established in every three wards. In order to train the principals of the central national schools and improve the efficiency of guiding national education, training classes were established in Suzhou and Zhenjiang last month. Although they lasted for only one month, the results were good. The department is now paying special attention to this work and has specifically organized a National Education Guidance Committee to conduct guidance work, so that the promotion of national education is widespread and extensive. As for the general registration of elementary school teachers in various counties, the department is currently conducting a major review. The salaries of elementary school teachers in various counties, starting from August, have been adjusted to a basic number of 55,000 yuan and a multiplicative number of 240. If the cost of living does not continue to rise, the teachers should be able to work with peace of mind. Finally, it was reported that the department has been striving to promote mass education since September and stipulates that multi-grade national schools should set up one mass education class, and central national schools should set up two classes, to promote adult and women's education. As for the counties in the province that have been recovered, there are 5,355 elementary schools that have been restored, with 17,351 teachers and 536,184 students.</p>

It is predicted that it can leave Xiamen today or tomorrow, so the Qunsheng Team will also be delayed by a day or two in arriving here.</p>

<h3>Tentative Suggestions for Improving Secondary Education in Shanghai (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xie Engao</p>
<p>For example, there are also hundreds of acres of land behind Song Park in the North District, known as Liuying. This property originally belonged to the city and was publicly owned. Before the war, there was a proposal to develop it into a public sports ground, but it was abandoned due to the outbreak of the war. The former site of the Labor University in Jiangwan, including the farmland, is also not small, and both are currently abandoned. The construction of a secondary education zone in the North District can utilize both of them. There are also many public lands along the north bank of the Huangpu River in South Shanghai. If a detailed investigation is conducted, there will definitely be discoveries. The land price in Pudong is currently not too high, and it is not impossible to requisition a base for a secondary education zone. Furthermore, the construction of the four secondary education zones can be completed in stages depending on the financial situation. Starting today, it is possible to begin with the West District first, as the land is already available there. If central permission is obtained, design and construction can begin. Each secondary education zone will use 300 to 400 acres for the construction of public buildings, and the remaining 30 to 40 acres will be designated as a middle school base. Each zone will have 40 middle school bases at most and 30 middle school bases at least, and the private secondary schools can freely lease them to build school buildings. Public buildings such as picture galleries, auditoriums, science laboratories, hospitals, music halls, art galleries, etc. will be built by the government in a unified manner according to actual needs, ensuring that the interior is fully equipped to meet the needs of the middle school students in the zone. Public utilities such as roads, ditches, bridges, water and electricity, gas, street lights, telephones, telegraphs, postal services, firefighting equipment, security equipment, flowers, gardens, lawns, and public transportation vehicles will also be the responsibility of the government, which will request the relevant competent authorities to plan, implement, and complete them. Life-related businesses such as public canteens, banks, bookstores, stationery stores, daily necessities stores, laundries, barbershops, and bathhouses will be tendered to merchants to build within the designated area, but they must donate a considerable amount of public buildings before they can obtain the right to operate these businesses. If the government feels that the funds for the public buildings to be built are insufficient, it may publicly solicit donations from the public. Regardless of whether it is an individual or an organization, the buildings donated will be named after the individual or organization to commemorate them for a long time. In this way, wealthy people who are enthusiastic about education will definitely be encouraged to participate in this righteous cause. The government can also establish one or two public secondary schools in each secondary education zone for demonstration purposes. The remaining private secondary schools will be solicited to lease the bases and raise funds to build their own school buildings within the specified time limit. The construction plans must be designed and prepared by experts, and the construction forms must be reviewed and approved by the government, ensuring that all aspects of the buildings are perfect in appearance and content. A small amount of rent will be charged for each school base, and the purpose is only to ensure that the property rights belong to the public. Since the government is responsible for planning important and special building equipment, all that the schools want to build themselves are ordinary classrooms, student and teacher dormitories, and offices. Compared to building each school separately, with each facility having to be self-funded, this saves a lot of money. After this plan is implemented, all high school and junior high school students must live on campus, and the power of education can permeate the entire lives of the students, allowing their minds to be in a process of mutual induction at all times, and their ideals to continue to grow. The incomplete and fragmented secondary education of today will be reduced invisibly. After a considerable period of time, it may be completely eliminated, and secondary education in Shanghai can be thoroughly transformed and completed. The issue of planning for construction funding is more difficult, but with the wealth of Shanghai, pooling the efforts of the government and society in many ways, and completing the project in stages, it seems not impossible. Now that the government has come up with a plan to plan a large education fund year by year, it is best to form a committee to fully utilize this education fund first, so as not to lose money day by day in the bank. When the amount is considerable, the interest can be allocated to the construction costs of public buildings in the secondary education zone. After the secondary schools in the city are moved in, the remaining school buildings and equipment in the city will be used to expand national education. In the future, in addition to national schools that can be scattered in the city, other secondary schools must be concentrated in the suburbs, and there will no longer be secondary schools that treat schools as transfer stations and teachers as knowledge vendors.</p>
<p>If the above plan is realized, secondary education in Shanghai will be greatly changed, and the predictable benefits are at least the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) Young people have an ideal education zone full of pleasure and adaptation needs, so they can completely leave the unfavorable real environment and live in a vibrant cultural field every day. After long-term orderly, meaningful, happy, and lively collective training and cultivation, they will surely be shaped into useful and capable backbones for the country and society.</p>
<p>(2) The teachers who run the schools, inspired and urged by the environment, and feeling the importance of youth education, the magnitude of their responsibility and the difficulty of their work, will inevitably rise up in the face of events, concentrate on their work, and hope to make a contribution to the country and society. They will never again be able to be as lax as in the past, not seeking improvement, or even having other purposes and using running schools as a means.</p>
<p>(3) Schools are run in a centralized manner, and teachers gather in one place, observing and studying each other, and competing with each other, all of which will help improve teaching methods and enhance communication. Not only that, but for all kinds of welfare undertakings for teachers, whether it is clothing, food, housing, or transportation, consumer cooperation can be implemented in any aspect, reducing the burden of teachers' lives and enabling them to truly achieve a happy and prosperous life.</p>
<p>Talking about improving secondary education in Shanghai is certainly not limited to improving material construction. However, if there can be a truly improved method in terms of material construction, then all other improvement issues can also proceed smoothly without much concern. If there is any inappropriateness, I hope that virtuous people will correct me!</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Briefing</p>
<h3>The Powers of District People's Congresses Should be Exercised in Accordance with the Provisions of the Municipal Organization Law</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government yesterday issued a circular to all district offices, stating: "It has been found that the district people's congresses in all districts of this city have been established. Regarding the powers of the congresses, Article 28 of the Municipal Organization Law has detailed provisions. The congresses themselves should exercise their powers within the legal scope. It is hereby ordered that you comply with this order and forward it to your subordinates for compliance." Attached is a copy of Article 28 of the Municipal Organization Law regarding the powers of the district people's representatives: (1) Deliberate on district regulations and agreements between districts. (2) Decide on matters submitted by the district head and suggestions from citizens within the district. (3) Elect or remove the district head and deputy district head. (4) Hear reports from the district office and ask questions of the district office. (5) Other important matters related to the development and reform of the district.</p>
<h3>Cases Sent by Each District for Verification and Approval Must be Thoroughly Reviewed First</h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government has recently found that in the cases of candidates for public office of types A and B sent by the district offices for verification, either the procedures are incomplete or the documents are insufficient, requiring repeated corrections, which is very inconvenient. Yesterday, all district offices were instructed that after receiving cases for verification, they should first review them thoroughly and only submit them to the department for review after confirming that the procedures are complete and the documents are complete. If there are any deficiencies, they should be returned for correction immediately.</p>
