<h3>八組憲草審委會　昨分別舉行會議　除第二組外均已推定綜合會委員</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕憲草審査委會七日及九日開會程序如次：七日上午十時第五審委會開會，九時第六審委會開會，下午三時第一審委會開會，三時第二審委會召集人開會，九日上午九時第四審委會開會，十時第三審委會開曾，下午三時第六審査會開會</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕國民大會第一至八憲草審委會於六日九時起分別舉行首决會議，或就憲草廣泛發表意見，或就審查方式有所決定，除第二審委會以對國大及行憲二事意見紛歧，秩序過劣，未俟議程進行完舉即倉卒散會外，餘均推定參加綜合審委會之代表。第二·三·六·七等審委會，均於午間結束，下午未開會，第一·四·五·八等審委會，除第五臨時以出席人數過少未果召開外，均於午後繼續開會。茲分誌全日各會情况如后：</p>
<p>第一審查委會</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕第一審查委會上午九時半假勵志社舉行百决會議，張知本·蕭一山·黄少谷分任主席。出席審査委員張繼等二〇四人，黄少谷報吿謂，按照大會秘書處通知，各審査委會委員出席達四分之一時即可開會，現已出席二〇四人已足法定人數，主席張知本即宣佈開會，請各代表依法推選參加綜合審査委員會委員二人，次即進行選舉，經各代表議決結果，以投票方法推選，選出黄少谷·王秉鈞。嗣進行審査事項，該組係就中華民國憲法草案前言總綱人民之權義與選舉作大體討論，主席並報吿謂，據秘書處通知，所有發言意見，正在整理，已收到之提案亦在付印中，故請先就審査方法及憲草原則作大體討論，各代表已發言者之意見書未整理竣事，審査故無從着手，至審査方法，應先將已發言者之意見及憲草原則作一綜合之討論，然後再分組審査，十二時散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕第一審委會六日下午三時繼續開會，到張知本。蕭一山·任卓宣·黄少谷·陳逸雲等四十餘人，以不足法定人數，改開談話會，就前言及總綱第一條交換意見，由張知本主持。</p>
<p>楊度晋發言，認言句不晰，意義含混，「依據中山創立中華民國之遺敎」一語，應改爲「遵照國父孫中山創立中華民國之遺敎」，其下應將民族，民權，及民生三點，特別指出，第一條「中華民國基於三民主義爲民有民治民享之民主共和國」，「基於」兩字，應改爲「爲」字，「民主」應改爲「統一」，蓋「共和國」三字，本已有民主之意義。</p>
<p>實甫發言，舉出三點理由，認爲第一條仍應改爲「中華民國爲三民主義共和國」，如是不准簡單明瞭，且不致有抄襲外國成語之病。渠稱，第一條最爲重要，若含混不明，足以影響全體主張，應鄭重修改，闡述畢，與會者僉認此種空泛發言，無補實際，決議散會。會後有集人張知本，黄少谷等繼續開會，決議：（一）互推陳逸雲·任卓宣爲綜合審查委會委員，（二）七日午假張知本邸開召集人會議，（三）七日下午三時續開第一小組全體會議，討論前言並決定分組辦法。</p>

<p>第三審查委會</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕第三審委會假會堂二樓休息室舉行，到代表張厲生，陳顧遠等一〇八人，由王寵惠主席，選出曾琦，蔣勻田兩代表參加綜合審委會。至於對總統·行政·司法之審査工作，以提案與紀錄未到，全體通過休會兩日，於九日召開二次會時再行開始，會議於十時半結束。又召集人推定王寵惠，王世杰兩代表，參加綜合審委會。</p>
<p>第四審查委會</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕第四審查委會上午九時在公餘聯歡社舉行，討論第七·八·九三章，到吳愼機，水梓等七十五人，江一平主席，各委員就八十三條監察院對司法院長及法官任命時之同意權，及司法行政部之應吾屬於司法院兩點廣泛交換意見，多數委員僉主司法行政部，在原則上應隸屬司法院，至監院同意權，經熱烈討論後，仍以問題與各方面牽涉過多，難於遽作決定，乃一致決定待其他各組商討稍有結果後，再行討論，並推定江一平，范予遂，楊亮功，張維翰爲綜合審査委員，十二時散會，下午開會繼續討論。</p>
<p>第五審查委會</p>

<p>第六審查委會</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕第六審委會，六日上午九時於華僑招待所開會，就雀縣制度廣泛交換意見，並推選李敬齋，鄭彥棻，張伯倫，劉中一爲綜合審委會委員，因提案未彙齊，改於七日上午九時繼續開會。</p>
<p>第七審查委會</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕第七審査會假國大會塲舉行，到代表于斌·胡庶華·谷正網·賴璉等三八四人，由蕭錚主席，審査「基本國策」部分，自由職業代表胡定安發言，請增列社會安全之規定，軍隊代表賀國光，主張經濟設專章，黄建中主張敎育分設專早，至此，遴選代表甘乃光，提議分組審査，各代表乃就此紛紛發表意見，有主分經濟·敎育·國防與外交等三組者，亦有主分經濟·敎育·國防·外交等四組者，討論結果經表決後，確定採取後者，並加入社會安全共分五組之原則，十一時十分休息，五分鐘後通過暫行休會。至提案紀錄及書面意見送達後復會，進行分組審査，並選舉谷正網·顧毓琇兩代表參加綜合審査會，另由召集人互推傳斯年·樓桐孫二人參加，至十二時十五分散會。</p>
<p>第八審查委會</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕第八審査委會，六日上午九時半在公餘聯歡社舉行，到傅斯年，羅家倫等八十人，由白崇禧主席，討論內容爲蒙藏地方制度，會塲發言熱烈，一部委員主張設盟爲省，以旗爲縣，而予內蒙以自治權益。另一部委員則主張，蒙旗制度不應超越現行組織法範圍，至西藏地方仍主繼續以敎統政制度，最後歸納各代表意見，認蒙藏地方制度之規定應在不破壞統一，不割裂民族及不妨害國防之原則下，妥爲制定，當獲得全塲一致掌聲。至該組推舉參加綜合審査會人選，推定羅家倫，賀揚靈及白崇禧，劉健羣等四人，會議至十二時散會。下午三時半續開會，繼續廣泛交換意見，蒙古等地代表發言，咸主盟旗地位能相等於省縣，盼憲法對此點能予明文規定，熱察綏等地代表則發表相同之意見，惟無任何決議。</p>
<h3>粵公團電國大　請即收回香港</h3>
<p>〔聯合社廣州六日電〕此間二十八公團，五日電國民大會，請即設法收回香港。</p>
<h3>周恩來致電馬特使　提恢復和談條件　意在阻止繼續進行調解</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕和平商談五日午夜一度謠傳有可能恢復之佳訊，蓋因周恩來致函馬特使，該函於五日上午十時送達，因內容不明，乃傳係共產黨對和談重開之表示。六日共產黨方面將該函內容宣布，所謂重開和談，已證明仍然不着邊際，該函內容如决；</p>
<p>自從一黨操縱之國大開會後，政協決議已被破壞，和平談判遂失基礎，但中共爲順應全國人民對和平與民主之願望起見，決定主張如國民黨即刻解散現正開會中之國民大會，並恢復一月十三日之軍隊駐地，則雙方之談判仍可重新恢復，請轉達政府。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕周恩來致馬特使函發表後，據有關方面表示，政府遵政協決議，召開國大，有各黨派人士參加，共產黨及民盟一部份未參加，自甚遣憾。國大雖已揭幕，政府仍洞開和談之門，隨時在期待，但共產黨爲一再以無誠意之政治攻勢，提出條件，則將來商談重開，殆不可能。同時，共產黨所提兩條件，一爲恢復一月十三日軍事位置，一爲停止正在召開之國大，政府自無法可予攷慮。</p>
<h3>化整爲零</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　濮德玠　俞振基</p>
<p>—憲法草案分組審查會花絮</p>
<p>六日開始了對憲草的分組審査，八組一齊開會，會堂上下內外，會外東西南北，開將起來，被疲勞轟炸弄得累了膩了的新聞記者們，又開始了東奔西跑，分版多的報紙，有近十個記者，大家寫寫意意，別無分號的報紙。一兩個人來往充軍，有人說「眞像胡適前一天說的，不准勞聽，不要記錄，倒也樂得」。</p>
<p>在審査會上，大家扯去了面紗，拉下了面孔，「不過」，「然而」不大聽見了，第二審査會的爭辯，十倍於大會的激烈，第六審査會却融融洩洩，因爲前者是包括「國民大會」章，後者是「省縣制度」。</p>
<p>第二組裏老孔庚發了狠，在會議亂到不能不作結束後，召集人繼續在本塲休息室開會商討如何分組，孔老却跑到門廊內問訊處牆下樓梯旁，在記者和一些代表包　中，一字一句，有聲有色的說：「關於國民大會的性質，必須加一條『國—民—大—會—爲—全—國—行—使—政—權—之—最—高—機—關』，性質不列明，怎麼說職權？譬如說，我要是老虎我就吃人，我要是狗就吃屎，我要是老鼠就唧唧唧，我要是鷄子就喔喔喔……」，同時，胡適·彭學沛等坐在二樓咖啡座吃茶，彭說：「先推幾個人硏討一下，把分組與不分組的利弊說明就好多了」，胡說「對對！茶房！」</p>
<p>第七審委會開得最長，爭的也是分組問題，有的主張國防。外交。經濟。敎育分四組審査硏究，有的主張國防·外交合併爲一組，谷正綱欲須爭取要把「社會安全」設專組，衆口附和，但一致要求要等秘書處把提案送到後再開始審査，結果，任意提名，無限舉手，選出了出席綜合審委會的兩位代表後散會，谷正綱一一四票最多，當選了要辭，某代表說：「我們大家因爲重視「社會安全』，所以才選現任社會部長熟悉社會情形的谷代表，希望谷先生不要推辭」，谷也就不響了。</p>
<p>大會秘書處，因爲議事組工作人員周來忙碌異常，備極辛苦，特於六日中午於會堂二樓休息室，邀宴該組全體職員，以示慰勞，記者們知道了，互對同業說：「誰慰勞我們」？</p>
<p>第一審委會上午到二百餘人，熟鬧有似菜館，午後僅到四十餘人，改作「自由談」，若干女代表知「譚」不出什麼名堂，紛紛離去，會塲益形冷落。</p>
<p>張知本喟然謂以一小組而有四百餘人，較之當年全國代表大會人數允多，國民參政會僅三四百人，立法院全體立委亦不過百人，人數如此衆多，審査工作實無法進行。</p>
<p>胡適謂集四百餘人於一堂，人多嘴維，其熱鬧有似菜館，主張成立一「專家委會」。</p>
<p>第一組召集人互推綜委會委員，陳逸雲在「尊重女權」口號下，無異議膺選，另一委員互相推讓，蕭一山主張用拈圖辦法，決定並用廢紙做好兩個，結果仍按「民權初步」用投票方法，選出任卓宣。黄少谷謂：今天情形有似當年選舉「學生自治會會長」。（十二月六日）</p>

<h3>晉西共軍擴大進犯　放毒彈圍攻中陽　蘇北國軍收復大團卞倉</h3>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕晉西共軍仍喝全力向南北擴大進攻中，（一）吉縣處共軍包圍中，其兵力約四干餘。（二）靈石·介休方面，共軍日來爲策應其攻勢，亦不斷製擊國軍據點。（三）截至昨晨，中陽仍在國軍堅守中，惟已陷共軍抱圍，城外四面據點殆均被共軍攻佔，惟因守軍堅決，共軍雖達二萬人，始終未能入城，三日晚乃以毒氣彈向城内及南北出射擊，軍民中毒者甚夥。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原六日電〕共軍犯中陽達六晝夜，猛攻數十次，均經守軍奮勇抵抗，予以慘重打擊。五日起共軍傾全力，以車輸戰法，向南北西各碉堡及南北河漕大碉堡猛攻，其轟炸各碉堡所用炸藥，每　約在二三百斤以上，晝以繼夜，波浪衝鋒達數十次，均未獲逞，戰况之烈，較大同。忻縣之役尤爲過之。六日自晟迄晚共軍續向城週各碉堡猛攻，預料入夜當有更激烈之戰鬥。</p>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕共方宣稱；豫北共軍於上月底越過　海路，向黄河岸前進，於二十九，三十兩日先後將沁陽，陽縣，武陟間之木攫，陽城，太鼓，陶村，大司馬，豇橋　國軍據點攻佔，復於二日估溫縣城，現仍擴大進攻中。又稱：魯西共軍於攻佔鄭城後，三日復攻佔縣城，但政府方面消息謂，鄭城仍在國軍固守中。</p>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕關係方面息，榆林情勢，國軍增援後已見緩和，被共軍攻佔榆林外圍據點，多已經國軍收復，共軍亦增援，連日仍有小據點爭奪戰。　　．</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣五日電〕國軍收復劉莊後繼續挺進，四日午後收復大團缕，五日午後進佔卞倉。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江六日電〕淮陰國軍之一部，自五里莊繼續向北推進，刻已進駐　橋（五里莊北五里）。</p>

<h3>確保太平洋的太平　——太平洋戰爭五周年感書</h3>
<p>今天我們不願意回憶起五年前所遭遇的事。我們並沒有健忘：五年前今日及其後的遭遇，情景猶新，彷彿是像昨日的事一樣。對於這些，歷史已有了它確切的評斷；如果我們再加以抨擊或譴責，那是有失我們中國之傳统的恕道的。五年前的事實是很明顯地印在每個人的心裏，是很明白地寫在歷史敎程裏。凡此事實我們似乎毋須再有所堯舌。如今日本戰犯的審判雖還不曾定罪，但他們對於人類的罪行是毋須加以指訴的；他們之將遭逢如纽侖堡戰犯那樣的命運，也是必然的事實。所以我們今天似乎不必回憶到五年前慘痛的遭遇；反而我們倒應該同情日本人民大衆今日所有的遭遇。我們同情他們，因爲他們在軍閥的横暴统治下，纔有今日的後果。我主席於日本投降後所頒發的對於日本人民的昭吿，今日還深印在日本人民心中，就是因爲我們的以寬恕爲懷。不用說，我們是受日本軍閥侵略最烈的一個國家；惟其奴此，所以我們　能寄予日本人民以最大的同情。</p>
<p>但是我們今天郤不能忘記了歷史的敎訓，我們應該對於五年前的遭遇之所以造成的因素加以檢討，進而防制同項事件的重演，以確保太平洋的得以持久太平。自從人類有紀錄的歷史以來，這遼闊的太平洋從來沒有過像最近五年来的遭遇。要哲倫的發見太平洋是太平的，誰知道太平洋上會産生人類空前的刼運？誰料到人類所製作的第一顆原子炸彈會落在太平洋上的廣島？可是這些已經是歷史了：我們所應該探討的是它的所以然。這所以然很簡單，就是軍國主義的日本之興起。日本在亞洲是一種邊綠上的民族。它按受了中國文化；但拒絕了中國文化的核心。這正如北歐的日耳曼民族在羅馬帝國時代之爲邊綠上的民族一樣。因爲是邊綠上的民族，所以它富有活力，所以它能在一個極短的時間達到了工業化的境地。而有了充夯的武備；所以最後它能與納粹德國沆　一氣成立了軸心。因此，破壞了太平洋上永恒的太平的是軍閥統治下的日本，是日本的陸軍，尤其是日本的海軍。</p>
<p>今天我們而欲確保太平洋永恒太平，鍳於旣往的種種，必須有所警惕。在事實上，警慯還是不够，而必須以行動來答復的。這行動的答復是什麽？這就是我們在太平洋上必須保有充分的武備。太平洋是遼闊的，我們第一必須保有充分的海軍。這次太平洋的戰事，雖有原子彈的使用，但依舊澄明了海軍的重要。太平洋的太平之所以被破壞主要是由於日本海軍的興起。在日本海軍被殲滅了的今日，在潸極方面，我們不能容許有另一敵對海軍的興起以再破壞太平洋的太平；在積極方面，我們必須整飭我們的海軍。在前次太平洋戰爭中，美國海軍担負起了它歷史的使命；所以此後太平洋太平的確保，我們不能不將我們的希望寄予殲滅破壞太平洋太平之日本海軍的美國海軍，所以今日而紀念太平洋戰爭的五周年，我们首先要對美國的海軍表示我們的敬意，進而　請美國人民，爲了她們自身的安全，要在太平洋上保有充分的海軍力量。至於　到我們自已，我們不得不坦白地說，我們的國力不許我們擁有强大的海軍，但我們的海軍必得担當起一種無可逃避的責任：這就是我們的海軍必須有確保太平洋西部和平的力量。如何而能使我們的海軍能够克盡這種責任，是則有　於我政府當局的賢明措施。</p>
<p>然而兵倒底是一種國事。善用兵者不用兵，但眞却不可不備。因此，欲確保太平洋的太平，我們不能僅求諸兵備；必於兵備外另覓其它途徑。和平的破壞是用於戰爭，而戰爭在若干政治家及政論家眼中，以爲僅是國策的延續。國策有衝突到不能解決時便不得不訴諸武力。這種口吻與其說是出自戰略家，毋寗閱是出目政略家。因此，和平的確保，其關健不在於戰略而在乎政略。這是政略家的責任，使國策得以避免衝突。在今日的世界，尤其是太平洋的世界，我們不能不承認有壁疊的劃分。消弭這種壁疊的努力之是否爲徒勞，自有將來的歷史來寫下它的敎程，我們此際實不應問到結果，而忽略了應爲的努力。今日我們有比過去的國際聯盟更進一步的聯合國組織，在這一個國際機構下，應該可以有太平洋乃至世界持久和平的確保，應該沒有不可以解決的纠紛和衝突。由於科學利器的發，人類應該不再有殘殺，而能和平相處。</p>
<p>在太平洋戰爭五周年的今日，我們以一片至誠遥祭那埋骨在太平洋荒島上，緬甸的森林中以及亞洲大陸上的無數的英魂。這是由於他們的成仁，使人類得以從一次慘酷的戰禍中過來。願人類能從此學習到何以相處，使太举洋能確保它永恒的太平。</p>
<h3>如何消滅盾的現象</h3>
<p>勝利以來，經濟界有許多現象極爲矛盾。這裏隨便舉幾個例子，如：（一）一面闊着遊資過剩，通貨膨脹，投機猖獗；而銀根却十分枯窘。高利貸無法减低；（二）棉花不敷用，要求趕辦美棉，同時浦東的火機花，却無人收購，種棉的農民，苦於找不着出路；（三）據六區紡織公會估計：每月的餘紗，尙有三三，六八二件，而配紗額却祇得四成，使複配會無法支配，綿紗的黑市也無法消減；（四）煤價飛漲，燃料管理委員會並沒有充分的煤斤可以供給；但不許商民自由採辦，以充實存底；（五）失業恐慌甚爲嚴重，旣沒有切實的辦法，來替他們安插，卻還是有意無意地在打破他們現成的飯碗；（六）帮浦可以進口，皮帶却不許進口，又沒有適當的國貸來替代，諸如此類，弄得許多進口商和用戶，莫明其妙；（七）物以稀爲貴，火油已漲價了，但聞有幾段油船，還停留在吳淞口外，無法進口，（八）明知道外貨傾銷，國貸無力競爭，大家仍貪　限　便宜，始終不肯把生產成本設法減低下來，也不肯儘　購　國貸，共同維護。私人如此，公家也未嘗不如此；（九）逐月入超的數字，着實可驚，一般國貸工業，又脆弱到如此地步，却還有人隨　附和，高倡自由貿易；（十）物價步漲，民生艱苦，但是有許多貸價，據說：還不够成本。</p>
<p>如此一連串的事實，我們處在第三者的地位，實不免有些眩惑。在各個關係方面，當然持之有故，自有其片而之理由。但我們認爲上述那些矛盾現象，無疑地即係此等片面理由所造成。各顧各的利害，各打各的算盤，面子上儘管說得寇冕，骨子裏鐺銖較量，絲毫不肯放鬆一步，那末，這些矛盾現象，怎樣可以消除得了呢？</p>
<p>商人將本求利，本來以營利爲目的。　所謂「千做萬做，蝕本不做。」我們當然不便拿公益或慈善的見地來加以苛求。但政府公佈的法令，或官商一致同意的暂行辦法，例如各種議價，配售等，我們總希望各方面切實做到，勿再存取巧或規避的意思。</p>
<p>至於國營事業或國家的經濟政策，本不以營利或牧人爲唯一目的。統籌全局，調節市面，可說是漬無旁貸。對於上述那些矛盾現象，除掉由國家的力量來酌　盈虛，設法補救以外，恐怕没有其他的途徑。尤其是物資和物價這些問題。我們當然盼望當局，要有一個確切明瞭的辦法。不過這些問題，都狠複雜，　非幾句空言，取東　西補，所能濟事。假如實施管制，必須要有整個的計劃，和系統的辦法；在人力物力方面，並須要作相當的犧牲。擧一例子：美國和香港辦理配給，對於某稽平價物品，多給與相當的津貼，並不要商人們担負過分的損失。單就這一點來看，可知辦理平價，或配給，也不是一件極輕　的事。</p>
<p>我們認爲管制得了，便應全面管制，自生產到消費，須要有適當的配合，和密切的聯　，不許因利剩　。零零碎碎地實施。假如一切把握不住，事實上無法統綢，那末，不如仍葡採取放任態度，讓他們謀取自然的調節。否則枝枝節節，徒滋紛擾，鎭所謂治絲愈棼，而各種矛盾現象，將益見其多了。</p>
<h3>北寗綫上美軍　月內完全撤離　平美軍當局正式宣佈</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平六日電〕此間美軍當局今日宣稀：北寗綫上擔任護路工作之美軍，將於本月底前兩星期內撤退。第七團之第一第二雨營，將由秦皇島及北戴河調回美國西海岸。唐山自九月三十日後已無美軍。此次美軍撤退後，華北將祗有北平·天津；塘沽及青島四處駐有美軍。平津及塘沽美軍任務，將爲維護北平軍調部美方代表補給織。留駐靑島美軍，屬於第七艦隊，該處正在訓練中國海軍士官。北寗綫上美軍，除秦皇島及北戴河兩地外，其餘己於十月中完全撤離，鐵路綫由國軍接管。第七團撤退之後，美軍第一師留駐華北人數將不足一萬五千人，其第五團之第二營駐北平，第一第二兩團及師部駐天津，第五團之第一營駐塘沽，第四團之第三螢駐靑島，</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日廣播：貝爾納斯今日籲請其他三國外長，在聖誕節前與德國前五附庸國簽訂和約，俾本年之聖誕爲真正和平之聖誕。貝氏並主張於下週一起開始討論對德和約。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約五日電〕四外長今日在協調精神下，解決五國和約一切重大懸案，除少數技術上的微細問題，可由四外長代表迅速解決外，義保匈羅芬五國和平條約均已確實商定，四外長殆將於下週一左右開始討論德國問題。四外長代表及四外長本身明日將先後開會，審閱經濟與海軍專家提出之最後報告。條約簽字之時間與地點尚未決定，因最後條文需用英法蘇三種語言製成，故不致在紐約簽字，蓋關係首席代表均將早離紐約故也。四外長今日協議各占星如下：</p>
<p>（一）「多瑙河問題」蘇外長莫洛托夫同意在羅馬尼亞和約中插入關於多瑙河自由航行之一條。此條規定於和約生效後六個月內，召開國際會議，章擬永久公約。（二）「賠款問題」義大利對南斯拉夫賠款一億二千五百萬美元，對希臘賠款一億另五百萬美元，對阿比西尼亞與阿爾巴尼亞各賠款二千五百萬美元。保加利亞對南斯拉夫與希臘各賠款二千五百萬美元。關於盟國僑民戰時損失之賠償比例，巴黎會議中建議照原價賠償百分之七十五，現經決定減爲三分之二。（三）「羅馬尼亞油價問題」四外長採納昨日之程序，即先由關係國政府直接談判，如不能協議，由四強大使繼續討論，倘仍不能成就，由聯合國秘書長任命仲裁員作最後裁奪。</p>
<p>其他協議各點爲：（一）蘇聯不反對特港自由區加入國際機構之權利；（二）以前各敵國禁止使用魚雷汽艇；（三）南斯拉夫倘拒絕在和約簽字，剝奪其應得利益。</p>
<h3>國際管制原子能　美代表提新計劃　盼望蘇聯能參加合作</h3>

<p>（一）設立原子能國際管理制度，其定義與作用由多邊條約決定之。在此條約中，所有國家一律平等。（二）大多數國家批准條約後，管理制度即發生效力。（三）條約中必須規定，在聯合國機構內任命國際機關，使各國間交換關於原子硏究之情報，禁止原子能利用於破壞目標，同時促進原子能用於和平目標。（四）該機關當謀在各國領土進行管制工作之便利，禁止原子武器之生產佔有與運用，追索違約者考慮違約者構成之國際罪狀，而決定違的國處罰之性質。（五）監督機關在偵察違的案件時，不得使用否決權，以免違約之一方逃避處罰。（六）原子能委會於本年底向安理會提出報告時，應將本計劃包括在內。</p>
<p>巴魯克在提出此案時，懇切希望蘇聯參加，並稱，「吾人完成原子武器之管制，即無不可能。完全消滅戰爭在吾人掌握之中，願與諸君之共圖之。</p>

<h3>美衆議員五人　昨日由平抵滬　論太平洋之和平即世界和平</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美衆議院海軍小組委員會主席艾塞克，偕議員畢密勒，畢紹浦，赫利，及孟斯菲爾德等五人，昨日上午十一時半由北平乘機來滬。昨日下午三時假華懋飯店招待記者，由美第七艦隊司令柯克海軍上將作陪，孟斯菲爾德議員則因事未出席。</p>
<p>席間艾塞克議員報告此行任務，乃爲完成去年視察太平洋各島及訪問中國各地之工作。艾氏等去年六月及七月曾赴太平洋各島視察，當時威克島等地尙在日軍控制之下。此次再來遠東，在華曾參觀靑島，天津，及北平等地。將於八日離滬赴冲繩島轉馬尼刺等地，預期於明年一月初返獨，向衆議院述職。渠等視察目的，不僅在洞悉美軍基地情形，以作美國參考，並爲國際和平作一觀察。艾氏發表其個人談話稱：「余深覺中美兩國間具有密切良好之關係，中美兩國携手並肩，則太平洋和平不難維持。同時余可保證太平洋和平即乃保證世界和平。」</p>
<p>記者詢艾氏美軍在太平洋設基地是防制何國？艾氏答稱：「乃防制任何一國欲破壞今後五千年之世界和平者。基地之設立，非爲三年五年之計。」</p>
<p>艾氏續謂：美軍在太平洋各島任務除在建立一完整之行政區域外，並負有一人性問題，即美軍當保護及協助各島居民，而根據美國一貫政策，實施其諾言，領導土著獨立自治，如菲列賓之建設一新國家然。艾氏深懼美議會將決定裁縮海軍而重演歷史悲劇。艾氏認爲海軍乃保持和平之莫大力量，如若裁减，將影響安全。渠又稱中國及其他國家均承認太平洋爲美國之海洋，美國在太平洋實佔有一極大任務。　艾氏否認美海軍在中國有任何基地，謂上海並非基地，靑島則可稱爲暫時之基地，而實際上靑島係中國之海軍基地，美海軍應中國政府之請求，在該處設有訓練海軍學校，目前有若干美海軍官員在校敎練。美國願盡其力量，帮助中國。</p>
<p>最後艾氏並答記者詢問關於對日本之政策乃協助日人走入眞正民主之道，使日本民族爭取言論，行動種種自由，而視目前情形，日本人民對於美國在日施行政策，並無不滿意之表示。</p>
<h3>設廠範圍暫分三區　昨日市政會議　通過管理規則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政府爲便於監督本市工廠及保護市民安寗，特訂定上海市管理工廠設廠地址規則。規定本市設立工廠範圍，暫分甲乙丙三種區域。其詳細內容如下：</p>
<p>一·甲種區：得設立永久性之工廠，其範圍規定如下：（三）第一區在曹家渡蘇州河一帶（北以鐵路爲界，南以康定路爲界，西以聖約翰大學東傍之蘇州河爲界）。（二）第二區在滬杭甬鐵路以西二千公尺處，向西沿蘇州河之三段地帶，其範圍爲：（甲）蘇州河以北：東邊向北一千公尺，西邊向北一千一百公尺，及其連接綫以內爲範圍。（乙）北翟路北二百公尺處起，向北至蘇州河及蘇州河北岸向北一千公尺以內爲範圍。（丙）北翟路北二百公尺處之延長錢，向北至蘇州河及蘇州河北岸，東邊向北一千五百公尺，西邊向北一千公尺之連接綫以內，西至市區辦爲範圍。（三）第三區在吳淞淞滬鐵路以西二千公尺，向西沿蘊藻浜兩岸各一千公尺內之二段。（四）第四區在虬江碼頭以西三百公尺處，向西至軍工路止一段間，北以五權路爲界，南以虬江爲界。</p>
<p>二·乙種區：發給十年有效執一照，期滿時得令遷移之工廠，其一範圍規定如下：（一）東至國貨路，一南至黃浦江，西至日暉港，北至中山南路以南一百公尺處爲界。（二）東以復興島運河爲界，南至黃浦江，西至楊樹浦浜，北以黃浦區界爲界。（三）分兩部分，其一，東以馬家浜爲界，南以浦東大道爲界，西以源涇路爲界，北以黃浦江爲界。另外部份東以白蓮涇港浦東大道及上海汽車路爲界，南以楊思港爲界，西及北以黃浦江爲界。</p>
<p>三·丙種區：爲不得設立之工廠之區，範圍如下：（一）舊上海縣城及舊公共租界中區之一部份（中正北一二路，中正南路以西，蘇州河以南，林森路以北）。（二）前工務局於民國二十三年規定，不設廠區及舊法租界所規定ACB三項住宅區爲範圍（凱旋路以東，愚園路以南，建國路。衡山路·華山路·中正中路·富民路·襄陽路·太原路以西）。（三）二十六年前規定定之市中心區及西體育路以東三百公尺，至淞滬鐵路爲界。</p>
<p>凡在前項規定範圍以外之地區，依照收復區域　營建規則第十九條之規定，准予設立使用馬力在二匹及　用工人在二十人以下之小型工廠。凡已設立之工廠，一不同於前列各條之規定者，除有一碍公共衛生及居住安寗者得予取一締外，准予暫維現狀。如因改善一衛生消防等設備，以及添建工房一等臨時建築而無關於擴大生產者，暫准添建之。一</p>
<p>上項辦法，已由昨日市政會議一通過，即將公佈施行。一</p>
<h3>歐哈德局嫌疑戰犯　無論有罪無罪　概予遣返招待　回增加收入張可能再受審判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第二批遣送德僑名單業經當局公佈，但因其中包括現由美軍法庭審訊中之歐哈德避嫌疑戰犯，故遣送日期將俟法庭審畢判決之後決定。按歐哈德局被吿二十七人除沈克等六人業已宣判無罪外，其餘尙在證人作證階段，約須二星期之時間始可載事。昨據檢察官奧康納少校宣稱，所有被吿不論判決有罪無罪，一律將予遣送返德執行，或釋放，或受其他處置。因德境美佔領區內自戰事結束後，即有「淸除納粹份子法庭」之成立，專事審訊希特勒政府之下級官吏，秘密警察及其他納粹份子等，故歐哈德局被吿，即使經此間美軍法庭宣告無罪，返國後仍可能再受該法庭之審判。</p>
<h3>中國風舞劇在長成中　孟姜女技巧成功　爲中國藝術開辟了新路</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕阿父夏穆洛夫的「孟姜女」上演了，這是一個可喜的消息。</p>
<p>無論觀衆們怎樣見仁見智，而有各種不問的批評，但是阿氏爲中國的藝術找到了一種新的　表演方式，新的傳達藝術的「工具」（Medium），是不爭的事實。　時至今日，崑曲已隨「文人雅士」之沒落而漸成絕響。京戲呢，固然今日上海京戲院的陣容還是盛極一時，然而可悲的是這正是「廻光反照」試問梅蘭芳儘管駐領有術，天下倒底有不有永不消逝的韶光？代之而興，恐怕正是共舞台的燈彩，坤　們的劈紡！</p>
<p>改良京劇至今還沒有卓著的成績。反之，倒是「俗文學」漸漸抬起頭來，而得到了可觀的收獲。戴愛運的嘗試給我們以極新鮮的印象，而她的成功就在她從俗文學裏，從民間藝術裏，找到了新路。</p>
<p>藝術是不能脫離民衆的。</p>
<p>事實上，把中國民間傳說改爲歌劇的嘗試，我國藝術界並不是沒有嘗試過。據筆者所知，在淪陷期中的平津，早就有人在埋頭苦幹，想把木蘭從軍改成歌劇，不幸辛勤作詞的王守惠君竟未竟全功，在苦悶中英年夭折！同時，阿父夏穆洛夫倒先嘗試了中國風的舞劇，得到了空前的成功。這舞劇就是「古剎驚夢」。從「古刹驚夢」的成功，關心中國藝術前途的人們，就預感到中國化的歌劇，已經漸漸形成了。果然，我們今日看到了「孟姜女」　「孟美女」的作曲的確還是免不了種種缺點。因爲，阿氏即使在華已有幾十年，即使對中國音樂非常愛好，而且下過了一番工夫，但是，音樂是一個民族從靈魂最深處的呌喚，飄忽得稍縱即逝，又明確得失之毫厘，便要差之千里！以前的像「在中國的廟宇裏」（Ina　Chinese　Temple）那種作品不必說了，阿氏的努力所給我們的感覺，正像賽珍珠筆下的中國人物——他們祇抓到了輪廓，沒有抓到實體；有類型，沒有個性。「蘇州」這兩個字在一個中國人的心上要引起多少聯想？阿氏即使努力，但是他能够聯想多少呢？　我們所注意的，而且是推崇的，還是在技巧上。三十年前，春柳社上演了「茶花女」，今日我們的話劇已經站得穩了。我們深信這次「孟姜女」會發生和昔年「茶花女」相同的作風，而引起繼續不斷的努力，以至將來輝煌的成就。我們一定要從「俗文學」下手，而應該負起這個責任來的，是我們中國人自己。</p>

<h3>獎勵建屋解決房荒　市有公地出租　市府訂定規則</h3>
<p>本市房荒問題，賒由社會局會同工務局建築平民住宅，以解決平民居住問題外，對於市民建築房屋，積極加以獎；並可將市有公地，出租爲市民建築之　。市政府己訂有獎勵建築房屋出租公地實施規則，其要點如下：（一）爲解救房荒獎勵建築起見，由地政局將適宜建築房屋市有公地，提經市政會議決議後，分期公吿出租。（二）凡建築自住房屋者，有優先租用　。（三）前項租賃公地，自完成租賃手結關後，限二個月內，向工務局請領營造執照，於六個月內與工建築，逾期即撤銷原訂租賃契的。（四）新建房屋各項捐稅之减免。依照本市解救房荒治本辦法辦理之。（五）公地租期屆滿時，承租人得於期滿前三個月，呈准地政局續訂新約，繼續承租。但政府對於該項土地如另有使用時，常於期滿前三個月，通知承租人，所有建築物如不願拆讓者，得酌給價款，收歸公有。上項實施規則，業經市府於昨日舉行之第五十八次市政會議通過。</p>

<h3>信孚廠糾紛解決　石作爲成立和解</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市信孚染織廠之勞資糾紛，經社會局調停後，業己和解。勞資兩方協議：（一）勞方同意星期日休息更改爲星期一休息（電力公司指定星期一停電）。（二）每星期工人如因要事經廠方核准，給假未超過二日者，休息日昇工免扣，超過二日者扣除。</p>

<h3>債市疲跌</h3>
<p>公債昨僅六〇四室來進統戊百餘萬元，是以統戊獨尙平定，餘者有散多爭售而見疲，統丙晨開一四〇〇元，高價不過一四二〇元，中途下挫至一二八〇元，午刻在二三〇元以上盤旋，較前收計甲乙丁各跌三十元，統丙跌六十元，統戊祗挫十元，成交約四百萬元。</p>
<h3>手帕業配紗不足之真相</h3>
<p>日來棉布市價略平，而棉紗情形，仍屬緊張，前日（五日）社會局曾召集棉布業負責人，査詢布市實况，據稱旬日內布價較前上漲，而未嘗逾越議價，花色布且不够成本，昨日紡建一開出之布，領得者己屬無利可聞云。染織業公會消息，配紗誠屬不足而布價究應平定，已通知各會員工廠體諒時艱，共維市面。手帕業公會以配紗經渦雙重六折，久表不滿，擬請願補救，但據紡管會及複配會消息，當十月下旬，吳市長決定配額之時，該業並未到塲，紡管會憑其負責人之電話報吿，即爲之軋進分配，此項分配額，僅與各業一律照六折核撥，而該業電話報吿之數，後始知其爲已預打六折，致有雙重折扣之誤。第四期第一次配紗時，複配會負責人已提議在總數中先撥若干，以彌補此雙重折扣之吃虧，而手帕業代表則以各業均感不足，不願挖肉補瘡，致有發動請願之舉，聞複配會定於今日（七日）召開會議，以解此糾粉云。</p>
<h3>我國棉紡前途樂觀　新訂紡錠百萬即將來華　本國需殷日紗競爭力弱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕某紡織專家吿記者，我國紡織界在英美兩國所訂購之紡錠，估計在一百萬錠以上。訂購者均爲擁有龐大資力集團一，例如中國銀行系交通銀行系申新系等。大部份紡錠在英國定購，小部份在美國；原因爲英國之錠子，折舊率較小，使用時期較長，美國之錠子，過於新式。以我國現有之工業環境，使用不甚相宜。同時英國過去之紡機，供給整個歐陸，現則歐洲市塲縮小，故有餘力可供應我國之需要。又悉我國定貨甚早，故在半年來如無意外原因，新機將源源運華，我國之紡織業將而目一新。惟原棉之供給，如仰賴美棉，則消耗外滙太多，國棉則因軍事及交通關係，數量少而難於集中。同時品質亦有問題，因美棉移植我國後，因地質及培植關係，棉之纖維發短，最宜於紡二十至卅二支之粗紗，四十支以上之細紗即不適用。至於我國棉紡業之國外競爭，渠認爲日本月前開工者亦不過二百五十萬錠，出品則本國需要亦殷，前傳運至香港之日紗，可能爲戰前之存貨。又美國目前已擁有紗錠一千八百萬錠，生產效率奇高，其棉布目前尙在供給本國之需要，未大量輸出海外，預計明年大量出口時，可能使我國市塲感受壓力。</p>

<h3>油價繼續下降　米市大體堅穏</h3>
<p>米市南北到源共計一萬三千石左右，市化平平，南市早堅午　，北市早定午疲，結果南北粳均呈高定次呆之狀，下等米略見軟化，白元餘元依然少神乏交，疲而不醒，黃豆東北續到七八千包，人心益見　軟，再挫千元，茶豆南洋去胃尙活，勢甚俏俐，赤豆仍趨平平之局，小麥堅穏，紅糧下降千元，苞米靑島　胃頗食，供不應求，續漲千元，芝蔴廣帮進吸，再見上升千元，生仁外埠實鑽不勁，仍居萎靡不振之格，　豆到銷兩細，市形彷彿，豆餅閔胃交易不多，站立之勢，麩皮銷路甚呆，續低一二百元，油市逐步下游，生油再小二三千元，豆油亦小一二千元，蔴油淸油帶平，麵粉成交極爲寥寥，雜牌粉小一二百元，廠粉照舊，洋粉兜售，喊價三萬一千六百五十元尙未成交，每包重七十磅。</p>

<h3>新大綢廠清理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市絲織業，近亦備受工商不景氣之侵襲。業內人成有欲罷不能之苦衷。蓋依目前利率高翔，原料不廉，人工昂貴，產品市價不振，種種不利之條件下，欲謀營業不蝕，又安可得而求之。然一方面職工之生計，又不得不加維持。據悉新大綢廠之淸理，不過整個漩渦中之開端而已。又以中交兩行承辦之絲織業貸款而言，各廠所得貸款，原僅限以購買原料，提供生產爲原則。惟査得款之各廠則認爲淸償高利貸之售欠，允較購買原料生產爲切要。故十九皆以所得貸款，移抵舊欠。聞央行當局，對此極表不滿。除擬收回已放貸款外，如各廠今後不能提供購進原料之確切證明者，將一槪不再貸給款項。</p>

<h3>大學足球賽揭幕　滬江戰復旦　下午二時半在交大球塲　兩軍秣馬厲兵準備大戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市專科以上學校及各大學第一屆足球聯賽，定今日下午二時半在徐家匯交大球塲揭幕，由滬江與復旦兩大學首先對壘，裁判陳陵，如遇天雨，由足球組通知停止舉行。本市大學足球賽，此爲勝利後第一次，當年華東八大學江南大學足球賽之盛况，將重見於今日，並有啦啦隊助威，徐匯道上，又將有一番盛况。雙方陣容錄後：</p>
<p>復旦：</p>
<p>張志榮　周天榮</p>
<p>劉開國　林良慶　王和生</p>
<p>黃剛維　（隊長）　錢長榮　瞿麟</p>
<p>沈嗣傑　黃克歐　項覇　王定球　任家桂　錢家駒</p>
<p>滬江：</p>
<p>趙堯章　張孚琪</p>

<p>黃庭舫　夏海汾　兪鴻昌　陳葆根　姚龍翔</p>
<p>涂必毅　楊永芳　吳敬江　（隊長）　鄭德耀　王敬偉</p>
<p>滬江　前鋒猛銳</p>
<p>滬江足球隊早經選出，每日練習，並於昨日午後商討戰略。按該隊隊長鄭德耀及中鋒吳敬仁，係該校足球宿將，與左翼涂必毅，聯絡默契，進退得宜。中堅俞鴻昌，善用頭頂，中鋒吳敬仁得球，向兩駕傳遞，左翼飛腿涂必毅掃送門前，尤多妙着，再由硬脚鄭德　準確扣門，雖不中亦不遠。該隊後衛較弱，惟鄭兪二將，可調防以應非常之局面。該校已組織六十人之啦啦隊，屆時將助威吶喊，由該校總務處程士德任總指揮，全軍士氣極盛，當予復旦重大威脅。</p>
<p>復旦　攻守俱佳</p>
<p>復旦足球隊，陣容相當整齊，隊長錢長榮，後衛王和生均係上海足聯甲組合羣隊之台柱，故後衛軍實力，遠勝於滬江。錢家駒，瞿麟，與沈嗣傑。有三飛腿之稱，加以中鋒王定球之穩定，與二內翼巧妙之帶球，恐士氣極盛之滬江，將忙於應付。唯該隊應竭力避免單槍匹馬之帶球直衝，時時顧及兩翼之空隙，則當可操勝券無疑。</p>

<h3>華道爾夫的盛宴　清一色燕尾服處處轉動　外交新聞　配合運用　儼然一塲　演講競賽</h3>
<p>— 十一月廿日紐約航訊　本報駐美特派員　毛樹清寄自紐約</p>
<p>巴黎初冬的陰雨，催走了盧森堡宮的熱鬧。戰後處女復航的伊麗莎伯皇后輪，把這些操縱世界命運的人物，裝來了大四洋的這一邊·從前並不爲人重視的：紐約公園路旁的華道爾夫旅館，它承襲了盧森堡皇宮的『衣缽」，變成了世界和平的重心。</p>
<p>華道爾夫門首插着四國的國旗。旅館裏，擠滿着『雜七雜八』的旅客。美國官方的警衛工作，做得非常隱晦，電梯口。酒吧間。沒有像聯合國會塲那樣：站滿着佩槍掛劍的『海軍陸戰隊』。外長會議本身，就是一個『寡後』的會議，秘密警察對這些「要員」們的保護，也多半是站在幕後的。</p>
<h3>爭取新聞自由　提出抗議</h3>
<p>會議　設在七樓一間會客室，除了開幕那天，准許記者們攝影以外，以後便絕不容許記者們進入。英美法蘇四國，在五樓各包下一二間房，作爲記者招待室。每天開會完畢以後，由四國的新聞專員分別報吿當天會議的經過，有時候，還可以加一點小小的一描寫。例如：莫洛托夫怎樣燃點一支雪茄，貝文在某次發言時漲紅了臉等等。他們的報吿：祇是限於『可發表』的。當然要比原來的，打上了一個折扣。美國新一聞專員，最初禁止非美國的報館一通訊社的記者旁聽，英國和法國一的新聞報館，自始至終是維持『一新聞自由』的原則的。</p>
<p>當然，很多人對美國的作風表示失望，有人向國務院抗議，我也是首先抗議的一個，『衆怒難犯』，後來畢竟開放了。</p>
<h3>人人都穿禮服　全無例外</h3>
<p>新聞記者現在不僅是『華道爾夫』的上賓，而且，也做過一次『賢主人』。那是在第一次歐洲停戰紀念日（十一月十一日）的晚上，紐約記者公會，公宴聯合國的五強首席代表及安全理事會的代表，記者公會在兩星期以前，就各別通知會員。規定公宴費是美金十元，每一會員可携帶眷屬，加總十元，携帶客人兩人以上者，每名加繳十五元，並且說明：「座位無多，火速定座」。　通知書上還隆重地寫出：「本會特請：貝文。顧維鈞·貝爾納斯·派洛蒂（法國外次），及聯合國大會主席斯派克（比利時）演講。」莫洛托夫到公宴那天，才答允出席，所以後來在節目單上臨時加添一句：『本會深感榮幸，莫洛托夫閣下亦出席演講」</p>
<p>公宴前兩天，我又收到記者公會的通知：『一律穿禮服赴宴』，這在我，還是第一次。在倫敦的時候，也　應過艾德禮首相的宴會，新聞記者都不穿禮服，紐的時報有位同業很生氣，大　記者公會那些「傢伙」無聊，他說：「又不是送葬，咱們新聞記者，可不受這一套！」</p>
<h3>餐廰改成舞廰　貝文話舊</h3>
<p>但是記者老爺們還畢竟守法，銀色的燈光下，五百多人淸一色的『晚禮服』，塲面硬是挺刮。莫洛托夫穿着華貴的禮服，最早到塲，和記者們握手，柏恩斯，柏恩斯的夫人，一個美國南方典型的高貴老太太，被「主人」們包圍着問長問短。貝文外相來得最遲，他一見新聞記者，便滔滔說他的感想。他說：「我一進華道爾夫旅館，就想起我的童年。三十一年前，那時候，我比諸位現在還年靑，我住過這旅館。』這三樓會客廳走上十八層樓大餐廳的時候，貝文禁不住嚷出來：「我記得很淸楚，我在這間餐廳裏跳過舞！』</p>
<p>他問旁邊的人：「這是跳舞廳喲，怎麼改成了餐廳呢？」旁邊一位美國新聞記者吿訴他：「是的，現在仍然是跳舞廳。今天因爲人多，臨時安排了餐桌。」貝文外相露着天眞的微笑，他相信他的記憶力不壞！</p>
<h3>郭泰祺兩夫婦　會中出現</h3>
<p>我們的郭泰祺代表和夫人，到得很早。郭夫人穿着中式旗袍，和美國許多女記者們誠懇握手。顧維鈞夫人因爲『傷風』，沒有出席盛會。顧大使的儀態，非常合拍而週到。有位四十多歲的美國婦人，和頤大使　手問安，他祇是講了二三句寒暄話。事後有人吿訴顧：那是紐約先鋒論壇報的名記者。顧大使彷彿又借機迎上去，很誠摯的談了好幾分鐘。第二天，紐約時報全文登載了英美蘇三國的演講，對中國和法國的意見，祇用一句話輕輕帶了過去。前鋒論壇報，對顧大使的演講，比較有詳細的記載。</p>
<h3>外交界新姿態　演講競賽</h3>
<p>外交的技巧，本來不簡單，外交和新聞的配合，依一靠良好的運用。在五十隻圓桌，五百名記者的面前，那天名雖爲「公宴」，實在是一種演講競賽。沒有經驗的外交官，在這麼多『無冕之王』的目光之下，也許會『昏倒』。法國那位『外次』，雖然沒有出　，但己經够慌張了·比利時的斯派克，雖然他不是張國的代表，但處處　出他是外交家羣中的『老手』，他的魁梧的身材，淸脆爽期的普調，幽默輕鬆的內容，以及不亢不卑的態度，博得了熱烈的掌聲。他　的是法文，聽懂法文的記者，早就大笑喝采，聽不懂法文的，等到用英文翻譯之後，也忍不住爲之『捧腹』呌絕。</p>
<h3>貝文嗓音宏亮　語多重量</h3>
<p>員文一開頭，就拉上了新聞記者的關係。他說，他是倫敦一張報紙的董事長：每日民聲報，（注）：英國工黨機關報。）他又說他三十一年前，到過華這爾夫，但那時的情景，和今天完全不同。然後方談到英國對世界和平的貢獻。嗓子宏亮，講話一句一句都有份量，儀一價政治家的演說。莫洛托夫仍然用俄文講，他開頭便說：今天演講者，都用英文或法文演說，「我因爲語言天才太差，不得已仍祇好用俄文，」然後才歸入正題。美國人都用好奇的心理，和神秘的神情，注意着這位紅色帝國的第二號人物。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯講美國精神　爲保衛公理·正義·和平而戰</h3>
<p>在我聽過貝爾納斯的幾十次演講之中，沒有一次比這回再成功的了。貝爾納斯以往演講，每次必帶有沙聲，這回淸脆悅耳，以往必「過份緊張」，這回「從容不迫」，不但音調姿態好，而且內容也好。第一，貝爾納斯是當今民主黨的中流砥柱，而國會大選，民主黨完全失敗。許多人關切貝爾納斯的前途，關切美國外交政策的前途，貝爾納斯在演講中有了答覆。第二，記者公會是公宴聯合國的首席代表，美國首席代表不是他，而是奧司汀先生，在演講中，他講得很有分寸。他強調第一次歐戰停戰紀念的感想，說到美國無數健兒，「馬革裏屍」，英勇地兩次戰死在疆塲，然後再說到美國決心保衛公理·正義·與世界和平。</p>
<p>成爲國際外交重心之紐約華道爾夫大旅館。　（特派員毛樹清寄）</p>
<h3>最後朗誦　美國母親的信</h3>
<p>他的每一句，都是文學的筆法寫成的·特別是最後朗誦着一封「美國母親的信』，我看見許多同業們被　　感動着，有幾個人眼眶中滾出了滴滴淚水。</p>
<p>那封信是一個明尼蘇達州的　國母親，寫給一個美國主敎的，那位母親的兒子，戰死在琉球島。這位母親描寫孩子怎樣英勇的投軍，怎樣爲一個人類崇高的理想，英勇的戰死在沙塲。她描寫和孩子最後的見面，孩子離去的時候，臨別的一刹那。每一句，每一個字，都充滿着熱情和眼淚。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯的演講，拿這封信結束，給許多人添上了不少回味。</p>
<h3>顧維鈞講亞洲　展望新生</h3>
<p>顧維鈞大使，是第二個講的，（第一個是斯派克），淸朗的英語，博得不少聽衆的　賞。那天，顧大使特別强調亞洲和遠東的「新生』。而這些「新生』，都是中國所感召的，內容有氣魄，有卓見。據說，演講稿是楊永淸校長撰寫，而經過顧大使修正了的。紐約時報第二天的新聞欄內，寫了一句：「顧維鈞博士昨晚的演講，展望着一個新的亞洲！」（於紐約時報大樓）</p>
<h3>英國工黨的新實騐　社會主義經濟政策在進展中</h3>
<p>— 十一月廿一日倫敦航訊　本報駐英記者朱尊諸</p>
<p>最近英國議會復會，工黨政府宣佈了這次議會期內的施政方針，當時工黨議員五十八人提出了一個修正案，指摘外相員文的外交政策右傾，與工黨社會主義政策脫節。自從工黨上台以來，英國的內政走的完全是社會主義路綫，但它和過去不同的地方在那裏？所謂社會主義經濟和蘇聯的共產主義有何區別？這些問題，似乎很少有人注意，英國人也似乎漠然。</p>
<p>對蘇是一大打擊　對美也極有影響</p>
<p>英國社會主義和蘇聯共產主義的經濟政策所共有的一個特點，是計劃經濟，所謂「統制」和「國家化」隨處可見，但兩者之間最大的差異，是英國工黨並不忽親個人自由，它的目的是要社會州主義和民主政治相携並行，所謂社會主義不僅是在經濟上的一個彩式，而在政治上不運反民主精神，這種制度如果成功，應該是資本主義傾滅後最理想的政治經濟制度，和不顧個人自由的蘇聯經濟系統截然不同。這也許是蘇聯對英國最嫉妬的一點，因爲蘇聯雖一向反對資本主義，但她本身的制度缺點太多；英國工黨的辦法，非但可以避免資本主義經濟的種種弊端，而且，在保持民，主政治精神的大前提下，可以診治馬克思所提出的社會經濟上的毛病，而走上經濟平等的大道上去。英國工黨的經濟政策還在實騐期內，一旦有所成就，對蘇聯的「理想」當然是一個龐大的打擊，對美國資本主義無論在表面上或在實質上，也會發生很深入的影響。美國勞工組織的力量雄厚，美國經濟機構如有發生動搖的象徵時，美國的勞工組織很可能效法英國，成立一個美國工黨，這樣的一個第三黨，有英國的先例，很可能的打倒民主共和　黨，繼而打進白宮裏去。</p>
<p>五年基礎已打定　保守黨無力周旋</p>
<p>英國工黨執政一年餘來最大的一件事，是「國家化」或「國有」一切重要經濟機構，如鐵路，公路，航空，海運，電政，銀行，以及重要工業原料，如鋼·鐵·煤鑛等。目前已經議會通過國家化的，有：英格蘭銀行和全國煤鑛，這次議會開幕後，要討論的有運輸事業和電氣業，在計劃中的還有鋼鐵業和紡織業。在自由經濟下生活已久的英國社會，對於這個國有一切的經濟制度當然不易一時就範，但工黨決定了這個政策後，一切提案，在工黨佔有大多數的議會裏便易於通過。去年七月英國大選時，一般選民之所以選舉工黨的理由，大部份是因爲他們對保守黨已經厭倦，希望換換局面，很少人想到在這次選舉裏，如工黨勝利，便是英國資本主義和社會主義角逐的開始。</p>
<p>工黨社會主義在百年大計之下，五年當然是一個很短的時間，難在下次大選時再捷再利，因之有人懷疑：在咱們這一輩子裏是否還看得到保守黨捲土重來？</p>
<p>英資本主義巢穴　變更制度非易事</p>
<p>工黨在這種有利條件推進一切，自然得手應心，但保守的英國資本家有時也頑固異常，譬如鋼鐵業國有問題，一時還無法進行，因爲大資本家在鋼鐵　裏股本很多，問題的複雜遠過於煤鑛業，目前議會議事節目上沒有鋼鐵業國家化一案，也是工黨份是工黨向保守黨投降的先兆。其實這種批評朱免過火，整個國家經濟制度的變更，不是一兩年內所可辦到的事，何况英國是資本主義的巢穴！最近，英國費邊社舉行五十週年紀念，工黨政府相當捧塲，結果受到一點奚落。費邊社是英國社會主義的先驅，但對國家化一點，主張從敎育入手，而不主張急進，所以一般所謂進步的左傾份子便嘲笑政府，認爲政府國家化的政策，原與費邊社的辦法相反，現在，政府一時不敢採取積極政策，却借用費邊社來掩飾本身的無能！</p>
<p>工黨社會保險制　建立得十分完備</p>
<p>英國社會保險制度之完善，爲世界各國冠，工黨執政以來對社會保險更爲努力。最近一年議會通過的有關議案，有「國民保險法」，「工業傷害保險法」，「國民健康法」等，加上過去社會保險的種種設施，現在英國人無論是生育死亡，老溺殘廢，失業退休……都由政府舉辦保險，凍餒之處，幾乎可以說是已經减到最少成分，所謂「從搖籃到墳墓」的保險制度，已經很完備的建立起來了。今年度政府用在社會保險上的款項，共四萬萬五千萬鎊，一九四八年時將增至六萬萬鎊，的佔全國收入百分之十。英國人口不過四千五百萬至四千八百萬，因之，這筆款項相當鉅大·英國目前已經離全體就業的程度不遠，即使連在過渡期內的男女士兵計算在內，失業的人數在全人口百分之七以下，短期內這個數字可以减低到百分之二</p>
<p>出口貿易額增加　房屋衣食感頭痛</p>
<p>至於英國出口貿易，工黨所採取的是傳統的一貫的增加生產增加出口政策，因爲英倫三島　海外貿易爲生，沒有生意便沒有一切。戰後，英國出口貿易的目標，是增加到一九三八年時的百分之一百七十五，今年九月底時已達百分之一百零四。英國經濟復興最大的困難，是勢力和原料缺乏，而煤的缺乏，則是英國對外貿易的致命傷。</p>
<p>房屋和衣食定量分配，是戰後英國最使政府頭痛的兩個問題，這兩個問題與人民日常生活發生直接關係。人民對政府關於衣食房屋的一舉一動所發生的反響是快，因之變成了一個心理問題，其實這都是表面上的困難，是任何戰後國家必有的問題。</p>
<p>目前成就已可喜　未來果實更偉大</p>
<p>民主政治和社會主義經濟制度同時並進，是一個新的實騐。在第二次世界大戰後的世界裏，祇有英國工黨政府不顧一切困難，大刀闊斧的在實行着，工黨黨員當然引以爲傲。但在國際上，工黨雖有它的理想，它所採取的步驟却非常謹愼，因爲在國際政治裏不應忽視現實，這一點有一部份工黨份子，似乎尙不十分明瞭，因而演出所謂「叛逆案」。一個制度的成長和魔術不同，需要時間，目前工黨的成就已可喜可賀，將來英國內部社會主義的實驗，開花結實之時，其在國際上所發生的影響，將不是一般前進的國際主義者所可逆料的。</p>
<h3>蘇北運河綫上</h3>
<p>— 鎮江二日訊　潘慎之</p>
<p>蘇北運河綫高郵·寳應·淮安·淮陰各縣，戰前民單物豐，抗戰期間慘這敵僞蹂　，勝利以還，復被共軍　據，面今　舍爲　，疫病流行，永災泛濫，哀鴻遍野，慘不忍言，筆者因事赴淮，適値蘇寗分署署長鄭通和。副署長李崇德，前往各該地視察，爰誌見聞所及，以實太報：</p>
<p>疾病與水災</p>
<p>高郵，寳應，淮安，淮陰各縣城鄉房舍被毀者的在百分之十至二十，江都之邵伯鎭，損毀較重，各縣學校醫院以及公共塲所，大都破壞，人民財產，損失甚爲慘重，生活異常困苦，淮陰尤甚。淮安淮陰間，運河西堤，被共軍決口五處，自淮陰以迄寳應，河西一帶，一片在洋，綿延百餘里，高郵西鄉，湖水泛濫成災，被淹田地，綜計約有二百餘萬畝，待賑緊災民，的有五十萬人，均屬缺衣乏食，流離失所，爲狀甚慘，淮安淮陰漣水泗陽一帶，患黑熱病者，約二十萬人。患雅司病者，的兩萬人，洗行甚烈，亟待醫治。各該縣大部糧食爲共軍掠走，據地方人士估計，餘糧僅勉敷今冬食用，明春糧荒，勢不能免。現屆冬耕時期，雖有一部份業已播種，但還鄉難民及貧農，尙缺乏麥種與耕牛，無法下種，河西一帶，水勢未退，冬耕殆成絕望。</p>
<p>危險的運堤</p>
<p>黃河決口未堵，黃水與淮水合流，由洪澤湖經三河壩注入　應，汜光，高郵，邵伯諸湖，而達運河，水勢汹湧，迄未衰退，運河水位，往年冬季，不過一丈一二尺左右，現仍在一丈五尺以上。邵伯至高寳段運河與諸湖之間，僅賴一綫西堤以爲屛陣，如西提不保，湖水傾注，運河東堤，即有潰決之處，倘東堤潰決，北自兩淮，南至邵伯，東迄裏下河一帶，廣裘數百里，將成澤國，邵伯高郵寳應首當其衝，受害尤烈，其危險性較諸江南海塘，實有過之。運河東堤，自邵伯至淮陰，凡長一百五十餘公里，亦即揚淸公路之幹綫，堤身年久失修，邵伯至高寳段，已有險工數處，高郵南門外堤身，且已滲水，如不及時興修，明年夏汎期間，危險堪虜。</p>
<p>鄭署長視察</p>
<p>淮陰淮安收復後，行總蘇寗分署即派員前往淮安籌設辦事處，並由徐州轉運麵粉舊衣，先就淮安淮陰泗陽宿遷災情嚴重之區，擇要發放，迨運河錢航運恢復，續由鎭江水運麵粉三百噸赴淮急賑，高寳方面，亦已撥運麵粉一百五十噸，派員前往査放，刻第一期急賑業已竣事，該署此次施賑，迅速簡捷，甚得地方好許，筆者在高郵，曾目睹該署查放人員，於暮色蒼茫中，仍在緊張工作，防疫方面，該署已請聯總外籍專家羅森先生及亞當小姐到淮組織臨時防疫隊，會同江蘇省衛生處，派往工作人員，從事黑熱病雅司病之治療，泗陽淮陰方面，已於上月十一日開始防治。</p>
<p>蘇寗分署署長鄭通和副署長李崇德兩氏，於上月六日由鎭江出發，察勘各該縣被災區域，衛生機構，小學校舍，倉庫管理，及遝堤工程，鄭氏視察後，當決定（一）由鎭江趕運大量麵粉舊衣赴沿運河各縣急救災民，並電請總署增撥淮屬賑粉一千噸，績放第二期急賑，（二）運堤險工，與運河工程局商定搶修險要部份，加寬堤身，並計　於險工處增築水泥塊石工程，淮安淮陰間決口五處，雖已臨時堵閉，惟工程草率，恐難持久，亦與工程局商定加工修復，（三）以工代賑，修復淮淮高寳四縣衛生院，並配給病床，及醫藥器材，淮陰方面，已運藥品器材二百三十餘箱，正在分配中，（四）協助沿運河各縣先行修復被燬之小學校舍廿所，（五）撥麵粉五百噸，兌換麥種，發給還鄉難民及貧苦者，從事冬耕，（六）盡力辦理遣送難民回籍，俾使各安生業。</p>
<p>綜觀蘇北沿運河各縣，災區廣闊，災情嚴重，災民衆多，蘇寗分署雖已舉辦急賑工賑，究係臨時救濟，深望政府當局，社會人士，力謀根本除災之道，俾蘇北人民，早出水火而登袵席。</p>

<h3>關於音樂用語的譒譯　四個作曲家名字的音譯</h3>

<p>這裏我想具體舉出朱先生等提及的幾個作曲家人名，作爲前次一文的引證。</p>
<p>一　Dvo　ák的音譯</p>
<p>先說出我的意見：，我贊同約瑟·張寗兩先生認定開始的「D」字母不能脫落不譯，但朱先生旣譯爲「伏夏克」，則第二個音節開頭的子音分明比譯成「ㄌ」的近似得多。這裏且讓我說一段岔話：</p>
<p>太平洋戰爭前一年或兩年，總之是D氏的「祭年」吧，我留在香港，適巧爲了替朋友校對一張音樂會節目單，跑進某家第一流的英文印刷所。有位洋人也在旁校「清樣」，但他的錯字特別多。我奇怪，「清樣」照往日是很少錯字的。伸長脖子看一眼，我首先看到那不是英文，也不是法·德·俄或意大利·西班牙文。定眼一看，找到許多Dvorak字樣來了。我好奇的問他：「那是捷克文麼」？這洋人似乎有點惱，僅說：「你怎麼說文是捷克文？一會兒，他又自言自語的說：「所有帽子都沒有戴！」我明白了，他說的是D氏名字中兩個字母上頭的符號都沒有排出來，因而校對得他發火了。由此我相信：張寗先生說「r」字上頭的分音符和「a」上頭的重音符，的確是少不得的。</p>
<p>接着我由印刷所知道留港的「自由捷克人協會」正準備在D氏「祭日」的晚上，要開一個紀念音樂會。我沒有放棄機會，當晚居然聽到一個意外豐富全屬D氏作品的節目。會中有人致詞，照常識來判斷，他極有可能是D氏的「大同鄉」，我聽得很清楚，他幾次提及D氏名時，把開頭的「D」字念得很重，沒有脫落。</p>
<p>那末，第二音節的子音即「戴帽子」的「r」唸什麽呢？我記憶上它不是英語「滾舌音」的「r」，而是舌尖及上顎間的「摩擦音」或「擦破音附帶破裂音」。它和英語的sh，zh，tsh，dzh稍近似而實不同。我後來在一冊日本人寫得語音學書上總算找到它的「音值」了，可惜書不在手，現時不敢亂說，但我記得，在日文·英文，和中文都找不到現成的恰合的相對音值。以上聽來的結果，我不敢作爲最後決定的準繩。</p>
<p>（二）Schuber和Mozart</p>
<p>朱先生所提到Schubert和Mozart兩人名的音譯，我想也一拼提出，好作爲「語爲情變」的例子。</p>
<p>記起日本和納粹德國締盟後的不久，希特勒曾派Kempf氏到東京做「音樂節使」。就事論事K氏的「血統」和音樂修養總可算無可置議的了。我聽過他的演奏及演講，他面對着擴音器前咬着標準口音來讀文稿時，逢到S和M這兩個名字每個後頭的「t」都念得十分清楚，而且S氏名的末後第二子音即「r」，也意外地強調，當時我就相信：在德國也有人讀如此字愷氏之譯爲「修貝爾德」而並沒有脫落個「爾」字。</p>
<p>也是那一兩年間，我看過兩部以S氏傳記爲題材的有聲電影，一部德國片，一部法國片。在這兩部片子上我很清楚的聽到他名字有許多念法，最簡略的是把尾巴的音節「—bert」讀成（—bet），即舌板中央最含糊的「e」，而底下的「t」就弱得幾乎不可聽聞了。這和平常我們聽到外國人順口談話時的發音差不多。但片子上有這個場面S氏窮甚而上當店押却心愛的樂器，走後因老關大聲呌他名字回頭時名字末尾的「r」和「t」都呌得十分清楚。</p>
<p>這兩個例子或許可以幫助我們可否接受朱先生所主張的譯作「摩渣」而省却末尾的「r」和「t」。我以爲，即便有人在談話上這麼省略（舌頭之想盡方法偷懶，也是語音現象之一。）但在標準的和強讀式讀音旣然依舊保存，那末，漢譯時似應採納後者。</p>
<p>不過據我聽過人們唸S氏或M氏的名字，不論怎樣簡省，也不致於像朱先生所說M氏名最末後僅留個「Y」韻，而變成所謂不帶子音的「通韻」，M氏名有人讀作（rnotzart）或（rnouzart），簡略一點則把後頭的「韻」縮成（—aat）或（—at）甚至（—atr）。至於說（—a）而不帶子音尾巴，還是第一次聽自朱先生。值得注意的是（—atr），這表示嘴裏說完（—a—）以後舌尖就推起到前齒，背後而完成發出子音「t」的準備狀態，但就在這時，一切發音器官完全鬆弛，聲帶震動停止，不送氣，不迸裂，而舌尖也放下來了。北平語沒有這種帶子音的「塞讀」。就我所知，廣州語的「入聲」字中却常帶有這個（—ati），如粵語唸「摩擦」之「擦」即是。朱先生以爲M氏名譯作北方語「摩渣」才對，恐怕根源就在此。然而這種略讀對於音譯，分明不足爲法。進一步言，口頭上稱呼姓名，豈祗省下一兩個子音？據說，羅·邱·史三巨頭會議中，羅斯福最初是稱呼「約瑟夫·史達林」的全文。後來混熟了，僅縮爲「Joe」一個音節，頗像咱們稱呼「老李」或「老朱」一樣。我想：假如有個姓「莫」而名爲「差（扎）特」的生在中國，他的朋友無疑會呌他做「老莫」。但簽條文時依然是「約瑟夫·史達林」；領身份證報名時依然說「莫差（扎）特」！</p>
<p>洋人對人名之發音不能照字典上那麼統一是事實，還有這國洋人寫那國洋人名字的「字形」，也不見得完全統一。俄國「柴可夫斯基」的名字在德文和英文裏一共就有四五種不同寫法。寫法不同，讀音分歧的機會自然更多了。「高爾基」這中文譯音譯錯了，英國人該負一半責任。</p>
<p>三　Beethoven的音譯</p>
<p>B氏名的音譯，正可以作爲上文第五段提及「原音」問題的具體例子。B氏在中國可說是人們最熟悉的一個，但名字音譯得也最參差。</p>
<p>我曾在書上查得他名字的讀法起碼有兩種，其一是英美人慣把「th」讀作一個「t」或齒舌尖音「th」，「貝多芬」「悲多汶」一類音譯就此而出。但德國人却更普通的把「t」字拉在第一音節，只剩下軟口蓋的喉音「h」留在第二音節，廿多年前首先介紹B氏名字到中國來而終於死柏林圖書館門前的王光祈先生，就譯作「白堤火粉」的了，這四個方塊字或許有點難看，「以音論音」，王先生的音譯正代表許多日耳曼人的即第二種讀法。</p>
<p>四　最後的「贅語」</p>
<p>從上述就可以約略地看到厘訂人名音譯之難易，然而這不過四個而已。再把許多人名一起的澝一下賑，那自然更還有個基本問題：我們理想的是儘量尋求個別的最準確，抑或先顧慮到全體最小限度的但平均的準確性，而寧願犧牲個別的最准確性。</p>
<p>最後我想提出幾句「贅語」：上文對於一切子音，我尚未計及「無聲」與「有聲」如p與b，t與d等和北平語之「ㄅ」與「ㄆ」，「ㄊ」與「ㄉ」等之間應如何搭配。因爲這原則不僅限於音樂用說的音譯。</p>

<h3>火</h3>
<p>— 蘇·柯洛林科作　李杞柳譯</p>
<p>多麼長呀！黑暗的秋天的夜。忽地我感覺到我是浮航在陰影的險惡的河上。在這時，河水轉深處，在我的韵面，有着熌灼的火光。</p>
<p>它是輝煌地，強力地熌耀着，距我很近了………</p>
<p>「啊！感謝上帝———我很高興地說——今夜的住宿地到了………」。</p>
<p>我搖動了槳，再望望火光，可是，又猛力地壓住了槳。</p>
<p>「還遠着呢！」</p>
<p>我沒有細查火光是這樣地在熌灼；它是在極黑暗的那邊出現着。槳已經提取了，很明顯，路程還遠着呢！</p>
<p>這夜間的火光，是多麼的光亮，戰勝了黑暗——在慢慢地近來了，在熌耀，在招呼着自己的親人。眼看就祗有二三槳的距離——到達目的地。可是，那中間的距離——遠着呢！</p>
<p>河水正像是墨汁般，無盡的黑暗，我還是很久浮航在這黑暗的河上。峽谷，峭壁浮立在這河的兩岸。在後面，留下的和遺失的，似乎全是無盡的遠景。但，火光完全是在前面熌耀，——它是這樣地近，也是這樣地遠………</p>
<p>現在我當時追憶起這黑暗的，被峽谷，峭壁遮陰着的河，以及這活生生的火光。在從前，在將來，被召喚的親人，不祗是我一個。然而，生命的溫暖，是需要經過那陰影的河岸，但，火光還是很遠。又臨到搖槳的時候…………</p>
<p>到底到底是在前面——火。</p>
<h3>俾斯麥的情書</h3>
<p>— 天行</p>
<p>德國的俾斯麥宰相，提倡「鐵血主義」，是近代的一位英傑。我在世界語的刊物「綠野」中，看到一篇他給馮·朴蒂凱美姑娘的情書，情意纏綿，好像讀着一首美麗的散文詩，特爲譯出。情書共分二對，下面就是正文：</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>我是只等候天一亮就寫信給你，我甜蜜的心呵！妳是一盞小小的綠色酒精燈，妳帶來了光明，沸騰了我冷清清的水。………這個早晨，我是很好來消磨過的，最適宜的一句話，是爲了寫給妳一封很好的信。在做了這些事情以後，我決計將這一個整個的晚上，想和妳；我心上的人兒，很快樂舒暢的密談中去度過。我寫這信的時候，好像我們已坐在那綠色的會客室裏的沙發上，妳是十分同情地留意看我底心願。這班郵車爲了我底快慰，恰逢着我正在空暇的當兒，帶來了妳底來信。………真是幸運啊，妳無論如何也想不到我過去從外面旅行回來重入我房屋的時候，我底內心是怎樣難過和痛苦，陰沉沉地，好像陷入一個冰窖中………唉，上帝！而現在呢？從我看來，一切底一切都和過去不同了，這是因爲有了妳，我底心是無時無刻不緊在你底身上，或者可以說我底心是完全屬於妳的。………自己的生活，整個地看來，是一個新的氣象，現在即使在做防禦事項和政治工作時，也是很高興而有趣。這個變化，這個新生命，雖屬感謝上帝的賜予，但不得不歸功於妳，我底欽慕着的可愛的鐘耐冬小姐啊，——妳，妳溫暖了我底心情，不像酒精的火焰似地忽明忽滅，而是在我底內裏燃燒起了溫暖的靜火呵。（一八四七年二月一日）</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>妳底來信爲什麽這樣的哀傷呢？在那封信裏，我尋不出有不愛我的字，也再想不出更比這愛我的字句。要不是爲了我的緣故，那末妳或者是那樣的吧，妳在想念到將來，在有些地方，造出一種困抑妳自己的心境，那心境就煩擾悶損了妳了。還有誰比我更心願應當來分擔妳底愁苦，受負妳底病痛，妳底錯失的人呢？………我親愛的蓉娜啊，，一定要我再向妳重述一遍嗎？我切愛妳；不消說，我們應該是彼此禍福共之，——我擔受妳底苦難，妳也負擔我底；而彼此的快慰，也各個分受到；妳又可以在任便什麽時候，對我傾吐心臆，我也滙輸給妳，我們底心血，彼此交流；我是應當而且願意來擔負妳底憂愁，妳底哀思，妳底懊喪的，——假使妳有的說話，——而愛妳像妳愛我的一般，——並不是說像妳本分應該怎樣愛我，或是可以做到怎樣愛我的地步。（二月二十一日）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　115</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>離開花格陣門還有一丈遠近，地上有幾方織錦的四方坐墊，到了這裏，跟在鶴見身後的兩個女子，忙忙傴僂盖搶前一步，又往地上一爬，從袖子裏伸出雪白的一雙素手來，把正中的一方錦墊，端整了一下。其實，幾塊坐墊，本來放得很整齊，她們這麼一端整，就是告訴鶴見，「閣下可以止步了，這就是你的座位。」</p>
<p>鶴見一止步，兩個女人，彎着腰身，好像連滾帶爬似的，飛快的往上首關門那裏走去。她們走路，兩隻腳自來就是盤着的，一時走得快，再加彎着身腰，那背上的一個大包袱，雖說罩在輕紗禮服內，因受了走路姿式不平衡的影響，所以只看見那背上的高峰，一顛一顛，一駦一駦，樣子十分不藝術。</p>
<p>鶴見到了這一位當日炙手可熱的重臣面前，兩人還不曾打個照面，當然不能馬上蹲下去；只好暫時站在那裏。只見那兩個女人，到了離開矮床還有一兩步時，猛地往地上一爬，連連叩頭，一面細聲喁喁，大約是在報告鶴見晋見得意思。那傢伙躺在矮床上，本來紋風不動，裝出那副「草堂春睡」樣子，死僵僵地；這時經那兩個女人一唸誦，好像機器人發動了消息似的，雖說仍舊沒有動作，只聽得他先從丹田裏，把運得足足的一口底氣，直吊上來，沖到鼻管理「哼！」地一聲，好像誰在他胸口猛地捶了一拳，發出這般哼聲似的。緊接，眼睛看着書，身體仍舊不動，聽見他像那老道士做法事時，那種唸着「急急如律令」的聲調，抗聲唸起書來；那聲音之高，是有正宮調門：</p>
<p>「轟孔角，受鷄腳達角立？寬，角替角，以斯魯鬼角，犯角侵托堂氣，哇…」……</p>
<p>他這機器消息一發動，引吭高唸起來，別的毫無關係；只可憐鶴見直挺挺地，站在當地，一聲雖說瞧着好玩，一聲却也像上海的口語，有些「吃弗消」。要知道他有五六十個小時，沒有好好休息哩；雖說經那青木長老，幫他把潛在的精神發動，然而像這樣消耗下去，哪裏能維持多久。據鶴見當時留心默記時刻，那傢伙躺在床上，一絲不走樣的維持着那種古人姿式，嘴裏僅那們「角几角」直唸着，至少也有半小時以上。</p>
<p>至於兩個爬在地上的女人，大約有些經騐，所以等那傢伙一發聲，知道暫時不會完結，便像蛇曝日似的，索性放鬆肢體，懶洋洋地伏在地上休息。那兩個藝妓化的女樂工，這時倒不曾鬆動，反而提起精神，像電影配音一般，配合着那朗朗書聲的高低疾徐，抑揚頓挫，拿琵琶弦琴來迎湊：高的也跟着揚上去，低的跟着抑下來，還要加上點逗，過門，補空，製造氣氛，等等，儘量把書聲烘托得有聲有色。</p>
<p>這位日本要人，當時掌握着全國生殺予奪大權，自從發動「大東亞」侵奪戰爭，也可說他啟動了這個東半球的殺戮；再從他勾結國際魔王，訂定了「七封秘織」，預備擾亂世界公法，和人類道德的現有秩序來看，那麼，他這麼一個傢伙，簡直可以說是煅壞整個世界的魔星之一。這時，到了這深更半夜，對着這個小小職位的鶴見，（從這傢伙的地位說，鶴見不過一個小小的特工人物，）爲了什麽，要弄這一套神經病希希的「十二點」玩　？</p>

<h3>玻璃商</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>攤販風潮中，被打的，受傷的，拘禁的，損失的，還有遭攻擊，受申斥的，比此皆是，一大堆，市長，記者，大家都忙得一團糟，不料緊張混亂的這一幕，却製造了一個給玻璃商人發財的機會，眞是「人要發財，鬼使神差」！</p>
<p>不信，請看事實：</p>
<p>其一，據永安公司經理郭琳爽語記者稱：騷擾事件發生後，本市玻璃價格大漲，總計兩日來已漲價一倍。</p>
<p>其二，據大新公司經理蔡昌謂：該公司所被搗毀之三十四塊玻璃，前日（按指二日）往蔡恒茂玻璃公司估價結果爲三千萬元，而昨日（按指三日）已漲至八千萬元矣。</p>
<p>兩天漲一倍，除掉賣人肉包子，世界上再也沒有更血滴滴地比這還重利的了。</p>
<p>經營玻璃，當然得玲瓏剔透，上海灘像這樣大規模需要玻璃的機會，十年中不知能不能有一次呢？放着這漲價機會不漲，難道怕鈔粟燙手不成？</p>
<p>有個朋友開玩笑說，照此情形，風潮中的打手，使人懷疑也許就是玻璃公司所雇請的。</p>
<p>又有個朋友開玩笑說，下一次如再有此類事件，我一定向打手們建議：請專門尋找玻璃公司玻璃店施展身手去罷！</p>
<p>市長先生，您對這個攤販事件的節外發展，有何高見？您不認爲這是一種譏諷嗎？（我不敢說是「乘火打劫」。）</p>
<h3>遷都之爭</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>爲了討諭「憲法」，發生了「定都」的一塲激辯，「南京」「北平」兩個地方，成爲爭執的目標。</p>
<p>主張「定都北平」的，是華北西北東北的代表，而除了這些北方代表之外，大多却又反對「遷都北平」，從這一塲爭辯的結論，回味一下，似乎是大家都有些近於「偏見』？而雙方亦難免「地近都門」，「因地制利』，而有『私見』之嫌了！</p>
<p>但是從事理上面論，我們先第一推討北方代表所謂「挽救目今的頹勢而欲遷都」的原則，依時論勢，我們覺到並不是『當務之急』！要「挽救頹勢』？却首在發揮「人爲的力量』，作爲先鋒，如果說根據歷史上有着交通，經濟，文化，國防，地利等勝越，作爲遷都的定論，那麽。要知道今日的科學猛晋，可以制勝一切！如果以爲倚恃着上項的優勝，而仍「墨守舊法」，「尸位素餐」，「不求改進」，那麼任憑遷都的地方，怎樣「完備」？都是徒然。</p>
<p>第二是一旦如果遷都，當然以經費爲先。回溯勝利初臨，還都時的經費，化了多少金錢？而交通上人事上的週折，煞費苦心，時歷數月，在在感覺到十分的困難！爲時未久，往事如昨，而現在的國庫，是「盈裕」還是「虧絀」？在這上下交困，民生疾苦的今天，又那裏担得起這個重任？「勞民傷財」，「曠時廢日」事之笨拙，無逾於此！</p>
<p>基上理由，在目今的情形，如果要遷都的話，有「百弊而無一利」，實爲「多此一舉」！倒是努力於「建設」，「精神團結」，「人盡其才』，「地盡其利」，才爲「挽救目今的頹勢」唯一的條件！</p>
<p>昔日舜帝做陶器雜器販賣商的時候，只要他住上一年，那地方就可以從荒地變成鄉村，住下二年，鄉村便又變成了郡縣一樣大，住到三年，就變爲一個熱鬧的大商埠，這就是舜帝的能够「煞費經營」的緣故。所以從這一點看來，我們感到建都的地方，却不以勝越爲主題。更何能在遷都之後，就可「挽救頹勢」？實未敢斷定！何况是在科學銳進的時代，「人定可以勝天」，又何必要發生「南京」「北平」之爭呢？</p>
<p>「嘡」它碰着了我身傍一位友人的脚尖，但脚尖却救了它，祇敎它擦破了一點額角，驀地我又蹲下去把它擎起，我要它再奔向毀滅。</p>
<p>我的友人却擋住了我的手，他笑着吿訴了我：「飯碗本身無過」。結果又被救了它。</p>
<p>一天，一月，一年……它仍隨着我在生命之路上挨過一程又一程，年華，風霜，早已把它鏤上了裂痕，正如我的面龐被綴上了縐紋。我在嘆息自已生命的時候，我也跟着想：「它也蒼老了」！</p>
<p>友人又吿訴我：「當心，朋友，現在你祇要略一震撼，它就要毀了』。</p>
<p>「飯碗本身無過」。在我的腦際縈廻，我開始對它眷戀。</p>
<p>「嘡」，聲音給我一個戰慄的澦感。</p>
<p>燃上燈一看，它已經從桌上掉到了地下，開成了一朶不大完整的蓮花，它得到了休息，永恒的休息。</p>
<p>床下一聲「嗤」，會神一看，原來是一隻耗子躱在那牆洞口正驕傲地在笑。</p>
<p>我俯下去，在它的遺駭中，取起了一片，細細地端詳一下，一兩粒飯乾因盥洗時不檢還黏在它上面。「原來是這兩粒飯乾，招來了耗子的覬視，」我恍然？</p>
<p>飯碗與黑夜，飯乾與耗子……一連串地在我的腦海中旋轉。我躺上了床，我又在摹想着一個沒有飯碗的明天。</p>
<p>牢騷</p>
<h3>飯碗</h3>
<p>— 學甄</p>
<p>飯碗，我生命的伴侶。</p>
<p>一天，我拿起了它，握緊拳，我要以拳來擊碎它，顯然我對它已憎惡，甚至厭棄；但結果並沒有把它擊碎。我意識到它雖然可憎，但還需要。</p>
<p>又一天，我顫抖着拿起了它，我發着猙獰的笑，我扭轉了頭，狠命地舉手一拋，我決心地與它決裂，甚至它毀滅。</p>

<h3>認屍</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>請問矛盾在那裏</p>
<p>『我曉得那屍體在水中已浸了好幾天了。對不對？』港口偵探郞生說。這時，他陪着霍達耐敎授駛車到騐屍所去，那裏，正在預備着給人認屍。</p>
<p>「我們在一條很冷靜的河溝中找到了他。』郞生繼續說：『啊，他死的景狀凄慘得怕人。他臉向下的，躺在河溝中，後腦被打得粉碎，滿是血跡。他的衣服是非常的潮濕，並且已經腿了顏色，那無疑的是沉浸得很久的緣故。還有他的面孔！啊，最低限度他已在水中浸了四天了。從容貌的描寫上看來，我可以確定那是他們正在找尋着的白德宛，雖然，我在他身上搜査不出任何紙張，或是名片來做證據。』</p>
<p>霍達耐敎授用疑問的眼光向那偵探望望。那時，汽車已駛到騐屍所門口了。所以他什麽也沒有說；到了那裏，他們看見那含淚的白德宛夫人和她的兄弟在辦公畫中等待着。互相說了一二句話之後，便銀隨着騐屍官。敎授。和那港口偵探一同走進了那冰冷的廳堂中。那裏，在一塊石板上陳列着一具灰綠色浮腫的屍體。</p>
<p>白德宛夫人咬緊了牙齒，過來一看，呌喊着說，『那不是我的丈夫！』於是，就暈倒了。她的兄弟也肯定地附和着他姊姊的陳述。那個人決不是白德宛。</p>
<p>『在這樣的一個案件中，認領的錯誤是一定會有的。郞生，我對你的見解，覺得不僅是使人懷疑，也使人奇怪，和使人好笑。』霍達耐敎授繼續着說：『有一件非常矛盾的事實已經表明了你的錯誤，這是你所早就應該知道的呀！』</p>
<p>請敎！聰明的　者，敎授意思中指的是什麽呀？　答案明日分暁</p>

<h3>當心盲腸</h3>
<p>— 中</p>
<p>香港是中國的盲腸，得小心點，預防「盲陽炎」，要緊要緊！</p>

<p>— 中毅</p>
<p>晋籍的學生們現在發起驅閻的運動，把閻老頭兒攻擊得「體無完膚」，嚴然是大規模的運動，結果，無疑問地我敢担保決無問題，去年安徽省不也演過這一套把戲麽？而李品仙迄今依然「坐鎭」。</p>

<p>流浪者，裏着稻草破絮在牆角下打抖，癩皮狗在旁也縮做一團；路人咸謂，這是沒有異樣的兩隻可憐動物？</p>
<h3>兩種利潤</h3>
<p>— 自力生</p>
<p>學生：「先生利潤有幾種？」</p>
<p>敎師：「有兩種，一是合法利潤，一是愛國利潤，商人合於法律的利益就是合法利潤，買自外國人，賣之於外國人，所賺得的，就是愛國利潤，例如羊毛毯」。</p>

<p>電影院的「譯意風」聽說也要徵稅了。看樣子當局對財政開源，充裕稅牧工作，正在「無孔不入」地全力以赴。據財政局稱：本市財政收入，「因物價不斷飛漲」，每月均在增加，上月份己越過十月份的八十億而達到一百餘億，這於市政前途的開展，當然是個可喜的消息。不過我們担憂的是：稅收數字的增加恐怕就是物價上昇的警報，商人何等敏感？爲了應付重稅，一定要籌謀補償之道，結果担子仍舊加在一般收入固定的消費者身上。消費者購買力創弱後，商店在重稅與高利貸的雙重壓迫下，便也很迅捷的宣吿不支，剛開幕未及月餘的高士滿商塲之閉歇，即其一例。急景凋年，喪鐘己響，我們對「因物價不斷飛漲」所獲得的稅收增益，與夫征稅征到譯意風頭上來，是不能不表示一點恐懼和焦急的！</p>
<p>「貪污公式」之一</p>
<p>江海關警察署匈牙利籍代理巡長納梅斯，因貪汚罪捕解地院受審，在審判中我們可以把他的犯罪事實分折如下：</p>
<p>時間：在四·五·六·三個月之中。</p>
<p>方法：經過了二十四次的匿報罰款。</p>
<p>數目：侵佔了二十四萬五千元。</p>
<p>動機：爲了醫治牙齒，無力負担。</p>
<p>辯解：因生活所迫，出於無奈。</p>
<p>這一段分析，無以名之，姑稱之爲『貪汚公式』。大槪目前的貪汚，地不分東西，人不分中外，大都採用這個公式。如上月間行總出納科長吳燧人的貪汚事件也何嘗例外？祗是數目上有點參差罷了。</p>
<p>打破官塲慣例</p>
<p>工商輔導處的歐陽處長，月初就職視事，報載「並未舉行儀式，實係打破官塲慣例」云云。可見做官一定要有儀式，已成吏道之常了。推而廣之，說話不能不打「官腔」，寫點東西也不能不帶點「官探」。官者，民之父母也，當然要與民有別。當初劉邦看見始皇出巡，巵從如雲，於是起了「取而代之」的心，鄭板橋屈居七品，始終爬不上去，看看撫果傳檄的聲勢，於是便縱情聲色，不求進取。所以『官氣』一重，貽害非淺，不是使人太消極，即將使人太積極，中　之道，唯有减少『官味」，與民相處無間。歐陽處長開風氣之先，賢宰　民，其庶幾乎？</p>

<h3>National Defense Council Passes Establishment of Committee to Review Next Year's Budget, Central Executive Committee Exchanges Views on Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Supreme National Defense Council held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 6th, with over thirty attendees, chaired by Song Ziwen. They discussed and approved various supplementary budget requests from different departments accumulated over the past two weeks, as well as several personnel appointments.

<h3>Eight Constitution Draft Review Committees Held Meetings Separately Yesterday, All Except the Second Committee Have Recommended Members for the Comprehensive Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The schedule for the Constitution Draft Review Committees' meetings on the 7th and 9th is as follows: The 5th Review Committee will meet at 10:00 AM on the 7th, the 6th Review Committee will meet at 9:00 AM on the 7th, the 1st Review Committee will meet at 3:00 PM on the 7th, the conveners of the 2nd Review Committee will meet at 3:00 PM on the 7th, the 4th Review Committee will meet at 9:00 AM on the 9th, the 3rd Review Committee will meet at 10:00 AM on the 9th, and the 6th Review Committee will meet at 3:00 PM on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The first meetings of the first through eighth Constitution Draft Review Committees of the National Assembly were held separately starting at 9:00 AM on the 6th. Some committees broadly expressed opinions on the Draft Constitution, while others made decisions on review methods. Except for the Second Review Committee, where opinions were divided on the National Assembly and the implementation of the Constitution, resulting in disorder and a hasty adjournment before the agenda was completed, the remaining committees all nominated representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee. The Second, Third, Sixth, and Seventh Review Committees concluded at noon, and did not meet in the afternoon. The First, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Review Committees, except for the Fifth, which failed to convene due to an insufficient number of attendees, continued their meetings in the afternoon. A breakdown of the day's activities for each committee is provided below:</p>
<p>First Review Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The First Review Committee held its first meeting at the Lizi Society at 9:30 AM, with Zhang Zhiben, Xiao Yishan, and Huang Shaogu serving as chairmen. Two hundred and four review committee members, including Zhang Ji, attended. Huang Shaogu reported that, according to the notification from the General Assembly Secretariat, committees could convene when a quarter of the members were present, and with 204 members present, the quorum was met. Chairman Zhang Zhiben then announced the opening of the meeting and requested that representatives elect two members to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee in accordance with the law. After deliberation by the representatives, it was decided to elect them by voting, and Huang Shaogu and Wang Bingjun were elected. Subsequently, the review matters were discussed. This group focused on a general discussion of the preamble, general principles, rights and duties of the people, and elections in the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China. The chairman also reported that, according to the Secretariat, all statements and opinions were being compiled, and the proposals received were being printed. Therefore, he requested a general discussion on the review methods and constitutional principles first, as the opinions expressed by the representatives had not been fully compiled, and review could not begin. As for the review methods, there should first be a comprehensive discussion of the opinions already expressed and the constitutional principles, and then subgroup reviews should be conducted. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The First Review Committee continued its meeting at 3:00 PM on the 6th, attended by over forty people, including Zhang Zhiben, Xiao Yishan, Ren Zhuoxuan, Huang Shaogu, and Chen Yiyun. Because the quorum was not met, it was changed to a discussion session, exchanging views on the preamble and Article 1 of the general principles, chaired by Zhang Zhiben.</p>
<p>Yang Dujin spoke, believing that the wording was unclear and the meaning ambiguous. The phrase "based on the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, who founded the Republic of China" should be changed to "in accordance with the teachings of the National Father Sun Yat-sen, who founded the Republic of China." The three principles of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood should be specifically pointed out below. In Article 1, "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people," the words "based on" should be changed to "is," and "democracy" should be changed to "unity," because the three words "republic" already have the meaning of democracy.</p>
<p>Shi Fu spoke, citing three reasons, believing that Article 1 should still be changed to "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People." If it is not simple and clear, it will not have the flaw of plagiarizing foreign idioms. He said that Article 1 is the most important. If it is vague, it will be enough to affect the overall proposition and should be solemnly amended. After the explanation, the attendees all believed that this kind of empty talk was of no practical value, and it was decided to adjourn the meeting. After the meeting, Zhang Zhiben, Huang Shaogu, and others continued to meet and resolved: (1) Chen Yiyun and Ren Zhuoxuan were mutually recommended as members of the Comprehensive Review Committee; (2) A convener's meeting would be held at Zhang Zhiben's residence at noon on the 7th; (3) The first subgroup plenary meeting would continue at 3:00 PM on the 7th to discuss the preamble and decide on subgroup methods.</p>
<p>Second Review Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Second Review Committee was held in the rest area on the west side of the hall, attended by 374 representatives, including Hu Shi, Peng Xuepei, Zuo Shunsheng, and Kong Geng, chaired by Lin Bin on behalf of Shao Lizi. As soon as the meeting began, Kong Geng proposed that the nature of the National Assembly should be clearly stated in the chapter on the "National Assembly." Some agreed, while others said that concrete discussions should begin only after receiving proposals and widely exchanged opinions records. For a time opinions diverged, and the meeting was in disarray. At 11:00 AM, Chairman Lin officially announced the adjournment of the meeting, and the conveners would meet to discuss the meeting procedures and subgroup methods, and would reconvene after the proposals were delivered. The representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee, originally scheduled to be elected at that meeting, were also not selected.</p>
<p>Third Review Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Third Review Committee was held in the lounge on the second floor of the hall, attended by 108 representatives, including Zhang Lisheng and Chen Guyuan, chaired by Wang Chonghui. Zeng Qi and Jiang Yuntian were elected as representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee. As for the review work on the president, administration, and judiciary, because the proposals and records had not arrived, the entire body passed a resolution to adjourn the meeting for two days and resume it at the second meeting on the 9th. The meeting ended at 10:30 AM. The conveners also nominated Wang Chonghui and Wang Shijie as representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee.</p>
<p>Fourth Review Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Fourth Review Committee was held at the Public Recreation Center at 9:00 AM, discussing Chapters Seven, Eight, and Nine, attended by 75 people including Wu Shenji and Shui Zi, chaired by Jiang Yiping. The committee members extensively exchanged views on Article 83, the Control Yuan's right to approve the appointment of the President of the Judicial Yuan and judges, and whether the Ministry of Judicial Administration should belong to the Judicial Yuan. A majority of the committee members all believed that the Ministry of Judicial Administration should, in principle, be subordinate to the Judicial Yuan. As for the Control Yuan's right of approval, after heated discussions, it was still decided that the issue involved too many aspects and was difficult to make a decision on immediately. It was unanimously decided to discuss it again after the other groups had discussed and achieved some results, and Jiang Yiping, Fan Yushui, Yang Lianggong, and Zhang Weihan were nominated as members of the Comprehensive Review Committee. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM, and the meeting continued in the afternoon for further discussion.</p>
<p>Fifth Review Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Fifth Review Committee met at the Public Recreation Center on the 6th, both morning and afternoon, exchanging views on the chapter on the division of powers between the central and local governments. Fifty-eight people attended in the morning, chaired by Luo Zhuoying, and Huang Luji, Luo Zhuoying, Shi Zizhou, and Wang Shuhui were nominated as members of the Comprehensive Review Committee. The representatives had a heated discussion on issues such as the local system and decided to begin the review after the Secretariat compiled the opinion papers submitted by the representatives.</p>
<p>Sixth Review Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Sixth Review Committee met at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center at 9:00 AM on the 6th, extensively exchanging views on the sparrow county system and nominated Li Jingzhai, Zheng Yanfen, Zhang Bolun, and Liu Zhongyi as members of the Comprehensive Review Committee. Because the proposals had not been compiled, it was changed to continue the meeting at 9:00 AM on the 7th.</p>
<p>Seventh Review Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Seventh Review Committee was held at the National Assembly Hall, attended by 384 representatives, including Yu Bin, Hu Shuhua, Gu Zhenggang, and Lai Lian, chaired by Xiao Zheng. The "Basic National Policies" section was reviewed. Hu Ding'an, a representative of the liberal professions, spoke and requested that provisions for social security be added. He Guoguang, a representative of the military, advocated a special chapter on the economy, and Huang Jianzhong advocated a separate chapter on education. At this point, Gan Naikang, a nominated representative, proposed a subgroup review. The representatives then expressed their opinions on this, with some advocating dividing it into three groups: economy, education, and national defense and foreign affairs; others advocated dividing it into four groups: economy, education, national defense, and foreign affairs. After discussion and voting, it was decided to adopt the latter and add social security, for a total of five groups. The meeting adjourned at 11:10 AM, and after five minutes, it was passed to temporarily adjourn the meeting and reconvene after the proposals, records, and written opinions were delivered to conduct the subgroup review. Gu Zhenggang and Gu Yuxiu were elected as representatives to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee, and the conveners mutually nominated Chuan Sinian and Lou Tongsun to participate as well. The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM.</p>
<p>Eighth Review Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Eighth Review Committee was held at the Public Recreation Center at 9:30 AM on the 6th, attended by 80 people, including Fu Sinian and Luo Jialun, chaired by Bai Chongxi. The content of the discussion was the Mongolian and Tibetan local systems. The meeting was lively, with some committee members advocating setting up leagues as provinces and banners as counties, and granting autonomous rights to Inner Mongolia. Other committee members argued that the Mongolian banner system should not exceed the scope of the current organic law, and that the Tibetan local system should continue with the system of religious rule over political affairs. Finally, the opinions of the representatives were summarized, and it was recognized that the regulations on the Mongolian and Tibetan local systems should be properly formulated under the principles of not undermining unity, not dividing the nation, and not harming national defense, which was unanimously applauded by the entire hall. As for the nomination of candidates to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee, Luo Jialun, He Yangling, Bai Chongxi, and Liu Jianqun were nominated. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. The meeting continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, continuing to exchange views widely. Representatives from Mongolia and other places spoke, all advocating that the status of leagues and banners should be equal to that of provinces and counties, hoping that the constitution could clearly stipulate this point. Representatives from Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan also expressed the same opinions, but there were no resolutions.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Public Organizations Cable the National Assembly, Requesting the Immediate Recovery of Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 6th] Twenty-eight public organizations here cabled the National Assembly on the 5th, requesting that measures be taken immediately to recover Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai Cables Special Envoy Marshall, Proposing Conditions for Resuming Peace Talks, Intended to Prevent Continued Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Yesterday midday, a rumor spread briefly of the good news that peace talks might resume, because Zhou Enlai sent a letter to Special Envoy Marshall. The letter was delivered at 10:00 AM yesterday, and because its contents were unknown, it was rumored to be the Communist Party's expression of reopening peace talks. Today, the Communist Party announced the contents of the letter, and the so-called reopening of peace talks has proven to be as far-fetched as ever. The contents of the letter are as follows:</p>
<p>Since the opening of the National Assembly, which is manipulated by one party, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have been undermined, and the peace talks have lost their foundation. However, in order to comply with the wishes of the people of the whole country for peace and democracy, the Chinese Communist Party has decided to propose that if the Kuomintang immediately dissolves the currently convening National Assembly and restores the troop deployments of January 13, negotiations between the two sides can still be resumed. Please convey this to the government.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] After the publication of Zhou Enlai's letter to Special Envoy Marshall, relevant parties stated that the government convened the National Assembly in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, with the participation of people from various parties. It is regrettable that the Communist Party and some members of the Democratic League did not participate. Although the National Assembly has opened, the government still keeps the door open for peace talks and is waiting at any time. However, the Communist Party is repeatedly making political offensives with no sincerity, proposing conditions that make it almost impossible to reopen negotiations in the future. At the same time, the two conditions proposed by the Communist Party, one is to restore the military positions of January 13, and the other is to stop the currently convening National Assembly, are not something that the government can consider.</p>
<h3>Dividing into Smaller Units</h3>
<p>— Our Reporters Pu Dejie Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>—Constitution Draft Review Committee Anecdotes</p>
<p>Today began the subgroup review of the Draft Constitution. Eight groups met simultaneously, inside and outside the hall, above and below, east, west, north, and south outside the hall. News reporters, exhausted and bored by the fatigue bombing, began running around again. Newspapers with more pages had nearly ten reporters. Everyone wrote casually. Newspapers with no other branches had one or two people coming and going, filling the ranks. Someone said, "It's just like what Hu Shi said the day before, no eavesdropping, no recording, it's a lot more fun."</p>
<p>At the review meetings, everyone tore off their masks and pulled down their faces. "However" and "but" were not heard much. The debate in the Second Review Committee was ten times more intense than that of the General Assembly, while the Sixth Review Committee was harmonious and relaxed, because the former included the "National Assembly" chapter, while the latter was the "provincial and county system."</p>
<p>In the Second Group, the old man Kong Geng went berserk. After the meeting was in such disarray that it had to be adjourned, the conveners continued to meet in the lounge in the same place to discuss how to divide into subgroups. Old Kong ran to the wall of the information desk next to the staircase in the portico and said, word by word, colorfully: "Regarding the nature of the National Assembly, a clause must be added 'The National Assembly is the highest organ exercising political power in the country.' How can we talk about powers if the nature is not stated? For example, if I am a tiger, I will eat people; if I am a dog, I will eat shit; if I am a mouse, I will squeak, squeak, squeak; if I am a chicken, I will cluck, cluck, cluck……" At the same time, Hu Shi, Peng Xuepei, and others were sitting in the cafe on the second floor, drinking tea. Peng said, "First recommend a few people to discuss it, and explain the pros and cons of dividing into subgroups or not, and it will be much better." Hu said, "Yes, yes! Waiter!"</p>
<p>The Seventh Review Committee held the longest meeting, and the dispute was also over the issue of division into subgroups. Some advocated that national defense, foreign affairs, economy, and education should be divided into four groups for review and research, while others advocated that national defense and foreign affairs should be merged into one group. Gu Zhenggang wanted to fight to set up a special group for "social security," and the crowd echoed. However, everyone unanimously demanded that the review begin only after the Secretariat sent the proposals. As a result, nominations were made arbitrarily, hands were raised infinitely, and after the two representatives attending the Comprehensive Review Committee were elected, the meeting adjourned. Gu Zhenggang had the most votes, 114, and wanted to decline. A representative said: "We all value "social security", so we elected Representative Gu, the current Minister of Social Affairs who is familiar with social situations. We hope Mr. Gu will not decline." So Gu said nothing.</p>
<p>Because the staff of the General Assembly Secretariat's procedural group were extremely busy and exhausted, the General Assembly Secretariat specially invited all the staff of the group to a banquet in the lounge on the second floor of the hall at noon today to show its appreciation. When the reporters found out, they said to each other, "Who appreciates us?"</p>
<p>Over two hundred people attended the First Review Committee in the morning, and it was as lively as a restaurant. Only over forty people attended in the afternoon and it was changed to a "free talk." Some female representatives knew that "talk" would not produce anything worthwhile and left one after another, making the meeting even more deserted.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiben sighed and said that a small group with more than four hundred people had more people than the National Representative Assembly in those years. The National Political Council had only three or four hundred people, and the entire Legislative Yuan had only a hundred or so legislators. With so many people, the review work could not be carried out.</p>
<p>Hu Shi said that gathering more than four hundred people in one place was like a restaurant with too many mouths and too much noise, and advocated establishing an "expert committee."</p>
<p>The conveners of the First Group mutually recommended members of the Comprehensive Committee. Under the slogan of "respecting women's rights", Chen Yiyun was elected unanimously. The other committee members pushed each other. Xiao Yishan advocated using the method of drawing lots to decide, and even used scrap paper to make two, but in the end, the voting method was still used according to "Elementary Rights of the People", and Ren Zhuoxuan was elected. Huang Shaogu said: Today's situation is similar to the election of the "Student Union President" in those years. (December 6)</p>

<h3>Communist Forces in Jinxi Expand Invasions, Launch Poison Gas Bombs to Besiege Zhongyang, National Forces in Northern Jiangsu Recover Datuan and Biancang</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 6th] The Communist forces in Jinxi are still making every effort to expand their offensive to the north and south. (1) Jixian is surrounded by Communist forces, with a strength of about 4,000. (2) In the Lingchuan and Jiexiu areas, Communist forces have also been constantly attacking National forces strongholds to support their offensive. (3) As of yesterday morning, Zhongyang was still being firmly defended by National forces, but it has been besieged by Communist forces. Almost all the strongholds outside the city have been occupied by Communist forces. However, because the defenders are determined, the Communist forces, although numbering 20,000, have failed to enter the city. On the evening of the 3rd, they fired poison gas bombs into the city and to the north and south, and many soldiers and civilians were poisoned.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th] The Communist forces have been attacking Zhongyang for six days and nights, launching dozens of fierce attacks, but they have been courageously resisted by the defenders, causing them heavy casualties. Since the 5th, the Communist forces have been using all their strength, using the "vehicle transport warfare" method, to attack the northern, southern, and western bunkers and the northern and southern river bunkers. The explosives used to bomb each bunker were about two or three hundred catties each. Day and night, wave after wave of charges were launched dozens of times, but they all failed. The intensity of the battle was even greater than the battles of Datong and Xinxian. From dawn to dusk today, the Communist forces continued to attack the bunkers around the city, and it is expected that there will be even more fierce fighting at night.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 6th] The Communist side claims that the Communist forces in northern Henan crossed the sea route at the end of last month and advanced towards the Yellow River bank. On the 29th and 30th, they captured the National forces strongholds of Muque, Yangcheng, Taigu, Taocun, Dasima, and Jiangqiao between Qinyang, Yangxian, and Wuzhi. On the 2nd, they also attacked Wenxian city and are now expanding their offensive. It is also claimed that after capturing Zhengcheng, the Communist forces in western Shandong captured the county seat on the 3rd, but government sources say that Zhengcheng is still being firmly defended by National forces.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 6th] Sources say that the situation in Yulin has eased after reinforcements from the National forces. Most of the outposts around Yulin that had been captured by the Communist forces have been recovered by the National forces. The Communist forces have also been reinforced, and there have been small outpost battles for several days. ．</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Office, 5th] After the National forces recovered Liuzhuang, they continued to advance and recovered Datuan on the afternoon of the 4th and occupied Biancang on the afternoon of the 5th.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Office, 6th] A unit of the National forces in Huaiyin continued to advance north from Wulizhuang and has now stationed in Bridge (five li north of Wulizhuang).</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Office, 6th] Dongtai News: After the National forces recovered Xicao, a small group of Communist forces attempted to counterattack on the morning of the 3rd, but they were repelled by the National forces. The National forces then responded to the request of the Baiju people and advanced in the northwest and southwest directions to protect the return of the villagers. According to people from City: There are now about three regiments of Communist forces that have been reorganized, and their intentions are unclear.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Office, 6th] It is reported that the Shuyang war has broken out again. The Communist forces have recently increased their troops in Shuyang by about 30,000 from Funing and have invaded Suqian in multiple directions. Xinanzhen and Dayishan are all under siege by the Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 6th] The Communist forces have launched multiple attacks on Bazao (northeast of Dongtai) and Biancangzhen (northwest of Dongtai) in recent days. After being severely beaten by the defenders, the Communist forces suffered heavy casualties. The remnants fled in three directions, one fleeing north of the Dafeng Company (eleven kilometers northeast of Bazao), another fleeing back to Fengcheng, and another fleeing to the Xinwang Temple area west of Bicheng.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 5th] The Communist forces' full-scale offensive in Shandong has been brewing for a long time, but it has not yet been launched due to insufficient strength. However, the units of Liu Bocheng, Chen Zaidao, and Yang Yong have already launched fierce battles with the National forces in the southwest of Zhejiang, attacking the two counties of Jinxiang and Zhengcheng, in order to relieve the main force of the Ninth Division and part of the Fourth Division. The Seventh Division of Zhejiang began to move between Gaoyuan and Tianzhen on the evening of the 3rd, and Yangyan attacked Zhoucun Changshan.</p>
<p>Communist Forces' Movements During the Ceasefire Period</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 6th] Relevant authorities commented on the war situation, saying: During the ceasefire period, the Communist forces' plan was to focus on the northeast, preparing to launch a large-scale winter offensive, deploying 100,000 troops in a fan-shaped formation along the Songhua River bank. The actions in Jinxi and eastern Shandong in Guannei were defensive offensives, not important. However, the Communist forces in Hebei province have also recently become active. The headquarters of the Hebei-Zhongyuan Military Region of the Communist forces has moved from Hejian to County, dividing its units into four groups, each with 20 regiments, preparing to launch an offensive. Its Tenth Military Sub-district has been expanded into the Eighth Sub-district, and recently its main force has moved to the three counties of Yongqing, Xincheng, and Xinzhen in the triangle area of Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding, attempting to threaten the periphery of Beiping and Tianjin. ，</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 6th] The Chinese Communist Party spokesman Mei Yi declared today: In the past month, the Chinese Communist military forces have actually preemptively struck on various fronts, and in the future the strength of the "counter-offensive" will be increasingly enhanced. The Chinese Communist military forces will fight to the end to restore the position as of October 13 this year, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] More than 3,000 Communist troops advanced towards the National Army south of Changling on the evening of the 2nd. They were repelled, and the remnants fled in the direction of Taipingchuan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Changchun, 5th] General Sun Li-jen, Commander of the New First Army and concurrently Commander of the Changchun Garrison, stated in an interview with this agency's reporter, Jolson, today: All areas in the Northeast are currently peaceful and normal, especially between Changchun and Harbin, where there is peace and no war. In order to comply with the ceasefire order issued by Chairman Chiang in early November, the National Army will avoid taking any offensive actions. However, in the past week, the National Army was forced to take certain defensive measures to drive the Communist troops out of the Nongan area (Nongan is forty miles north of Changchun). It is reported that the Communist troops have concentrated ten divisions southwest of Harbin, each division with 10,000 soldiers. If the National Army receives orders to attack Harbin, it can occupy Harbin within five days.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Zhao Junli, the Mayor of Changchun, stated: If the National Army recovers Harbin this winter, the political and economic center of the Northeast will be moved from Shenyang to Changchun next spring. Currently, the war is only taking place fifty kilometers northwest and east of Changchun, so it is still too early to immediately transfer the political center.</p>

The Railway Bureau has set the 15th as the date for selling through tickets between Peiping and Suiyuan. Prices in Suiyuan have already fallen as a result.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, This Newspaper, 6th] Traffic circles report: The Ping-Sui Railway, which has been dismembered for a long time, can be restored to full operation around New Year's Day. Currently, the only gap in the entire line, the Zhangjiakou to Dazhou section, has had its eastern section repaired from Zhangjiakou to Tianjin, and its western section repaired from Datong to Yongjiabao. Only two stations in the middle remain to be repaired. If military forces can ensure the security of the entire line, the entire line will surely be open to traffic around the New Year. Since the Ping-Zhang line opened to traffic on the 20th of last month, food, fur, meat, and chestnuts from Chahar Province have been flowing eastward continuously, which has greatly helped to stabilize commodity prices in Peiping and Tianjin. Cloth and daily necessities from Peiping and Tianjin are also surging westward, and the lives of the people of Chahar Province have improved slightly as a result.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in New York Enjoying a Banquet; Feng Yuxiang Delivers a Speech, Saying He is Over Sixty Years Old and No Longer Has Political Ambitions; Emphasizes That China Must Unite and be Unified</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper's Special Correspondent in New York, 6th] The local overseas Chinese organization, "The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association," hosted a banquet for General Feng Yuxiang at the "Traveling People" restaurant tonight. Mr. Feng delivered his first speech after arriving in New York, stating, "I am sixty-five years old, my temples are already white, and I no longer have political ambitions." A total of 120 overseas Chinese, about twelve tables, attended the banquet. Mr. Feng deeply admired the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese in America for supporting the National Father's revolution in the past and for enthusiastically donating funds during the eight-year war of resistance against Japan. He also recounted the major sacrifices made by China during the eight-year war of resistance. For example, in Guilin alone, no fewer than five thousand houses were destroyed by bombs and artillery fire. "The Chinese government mobilized 30 million people to participate in combat and battlefield service, and encountered a serious economic crisis in the final stages of the war." Mr. Feng then described the thrift and savings movement he launched in Sichuan in 1943 and 1944, and the people all enthusiastically contributed. There were donations of 10 million and 15 million yuan at a time. After the outbreak of the Shanghai battle in 1937, Mr. Feng was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Third War Zone, and famous generals Chen Cheng, Zhang Zhizhong, Gu Zhutong, Yang Hu, and Zhang Fakui were all under his command. "The battlefield is like a furnace, and it is no easy task for 30,000 troops to charge into battle, kill enemies, and win victories." Mr. Feng expressed optimism about the current domestic political situation, comparing it to the era of Washington and Lincoln in American history. Mr. Feng continued in a firm tone, "China must unite and be unified. I have been a Christian for thirty-five years and have no religious prejudices against Catholicism, Buddhism, or other religions. At the same time, I have been in the military for fifty-three years and have no professional prejudices against farmers, merchants, or industrialists. People from all walks of life are my close friends, such as Bishop Yu Bin, a Catholic, and masters who believe in Buddhism. I am a Kuomintang member and a loyal follower of the National Father Sun Yat-sen, but I have made many close friends from various parties in my life. I often sit at the same table with Zhou Enlai and dine with Chairman Chiang because we are all Chinese compatriots. I know that there are a few troublemakers who intend to slander me, but I can openly say here that I am sixty-five years old and no longer have political ambitions." Mr. Feng then mentioned China's international trade, reminding the people to improve the quality of tung oil and tea leaves. "I have seen countless 'Lipton' tea advertisements in the New York subway. According to American friends, 'Lipton' tea is an improved Indian tea produced by the British, and its sales reach all over the world. Tea is a famous product of China, and my hometown of Anhui produces the famous Lu'an tea, but walking around New York City, I cannot find advertisements for Lu'an tea, which is very strange." New York Consul General Zhang Pingqun and Chairman Chen Zhonghai also spoke at the banquet, introducing Mr. Feng to all the overseas Chinese in America.</p>
<h3>Current Situation in Yikezhao League is Peaceful; League Deputy Leader Dingxia Meets with Fei, Then Flies to Nanking; Restoration Work in Suiyuan and Rehe Mongolian Banners Completed</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Gui Sui, 5th] Ewang, the Deputy Leader of the Yikezhao League, recently came to Sui from Zhasak Brigade and is scheduled to fly to Peiping next week to go to Nanking to pay respects to the Chairman. According to him: The current situation in Yikezhao League is extremely peaceful. League Leader Tuwang and Chen Yujia, the representative of Commander Fu, have made thorough arrangements for the security affairs of the Yikezhao League. The security forces of the seven banners of Yikezhao League have all been concentrated, and Chen Yujia has been ordered to maintain the transportation of Yikezhao League and support Yulin.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, This Newspaper, 6th] Regarding the recent situation in the Mongolian border and the restoration of the Mongolian banners, according to the person in charge of the Peiping Office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission: During the Anti-Japanese War, the Mongolian banners in Suiyuan were led by Commander Fu Zuoyi of the Twelfth War Zone, and they were able to cooperate fully and always dealt with the enemy and sincerely supported the Central Government. National sentiments became increasingly harmonious, and the various princes and governors of Sui and Mongolian were well aware of the righteousness and contributed greatly during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, Sui and Mongolian were the first to complete the restoration work. Currently, in addition to Sui and Mongolian, the restoration work of the Horqin and other Mongolian banners in Rehe has also been completed. Secondly, the restoration work of the twelve banners in Mongolian territory is also being carried out one after another recently. Only the Xilingol League in Chahar is left, which has not yet begun restoration due to its remote location. At present, the security situation in Rehe, Chahar, Sui, and Mongolian is also said to be good. The Central Government is extremely concerned about the disaster situation in the Mongolian banner areas. In May of this year, it allocated 10 million yuan in relief funds, and the Mongolian compatriots were able to receive a small share. There are currently 1,000 Mongolian people in Peiping City, most of whom have difficult lives. The Peiping Office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission recently requested the Peiping-Tianjin branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to provide flour relief, with each person receiving 30 pounds and a can of condensed milk. Although this is a small amount, it can help in case of emergency, and relief matters can still be handled in the future. After the Mongolian banner areas were occupied, eight years of nomadic life were mostly destroyed. Rebuilding the Mongolian banners and guiding the lives of the Mongolian people in the future will be important tasks.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, This Newspaper, 6th] The Peiping Headquarters has decided to establish a Mongolian Banner Issues Research Group, chaired by Councilor Wang Hongshao, which will bring together various relevant agencies and scholars from various Mongolian Banners. It will be established in the near future to study Mongolian Banner issues and serve as a reference for policy implementation. Fu Zuoyi also agrees with this. It is reported that Li Zongren has made some suggestions to the Central Government on the Mongolian Banner issue in Nanking, asking that the demands of the Mongolian compatriots be taken seriously.</p>
<h3>Canal Passing Through the Yellow River Project:</h3>
<p>Complete Plans Can Be Drafted Soon</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 6th] The canal connecting north and south transportation has been silted up by the Yellow River over the years and is like a withered leaf. The provincial government has consulted with the Shandong-Henan-Qingdao Branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and decided to use the period when the Yellow River has no water to complete the canal's crossing of the Yellow River project at the intersection of the Yellow River and the canal in Dongping and Dong'a counties in the form of work relief.

A preliminary survey will be conducted to prepare for future construction. The Provincial Government's Water Conservancy Bureau is currently organizing a Jiaolai Canal Survey Team, which will depart soon. After the Jiaolai Canal is opened, maritime transportation can avoid the dangerous promontory of Chengshan Cape, shortening the voyage by 500 kilometers.

<h3>Ensuring Peace in the Pacific: Reflections on the Fifth Anniversary of the Pacific War</h3>
<p>Today, we are reluctant to recall the events of five years ago. We have not forgotten: the events of this day five years ago and those that followed are as vivid as if they happened yesterday. History has already made its definitive judgments on these events; further attacking or condemning them would be a departure from the traditional Chinese virtue of forgiveness. The facts of five years ago are clearly imprinted in everyone's mind and plainly written in history textbooks. We seem to have no need to dwell on these facts any further. Although the trials of Japanese war criminals have yet to reach a verdict, their crimes against humanity need no further pointing out. Their fate will inevitably resemble that of the Nuremberg war criminals. Therefore, we seem to have no need to recall the tragic events of five years ago today; instead, we should sympathize with the plight of the Japanese people today. We sympathize with them because they are suffering the consequences of being under the tyrannical rule of militarists. Chairman Chiang's proclamation to the Japanese people after their surrender remains deeply etched in their hearts today because of our spirit of forgiveness. Needless to say, we were the nation most severely invaded by Japanese militarists; precisely because of this, we can extend the greatest sympathy to the Japanese people.</p>
<p>However, today we must not forget the lessons of history. We should examine the factors that led to the events of five years ago and, furthermore, prevent a recurrence of similar events to ensure lasting peace in the Pacific. Since the beginning of recorded human history, this vast Pacific Ocean has never experienced anything like the events of the past five years. Magellan thought the Pacific was peaceful, but who knew that the Pacific would give rise to an unprecedented calamity for humanity? Who would have thought that the first atomic bomb ever created by mankind would fall on Hiroshima in the Pacific? But these are already history: what we should explore is the reason why. The reason is simple: it is the rise of militaristic Japan. Japan is a peripheral nation in Asia. It accepted Chinese culture but rejected its core. This is similar to how the Germanic peoples of Northern Europe were peripheral nations during the Roman Empire. Because it was a peripheral nation, it was full of vitality and was able to achieve industrialization in a very short period. And with sufficient armaments, it was eventually able to collude with Nazi Germany to form the Axis. Therefore, it was Japan under the rule of militarists, the Japanese army, especially the Japanese navy, that destroyed the eternal peace of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Today, if we want to ensure lasting peace in the Pacific, given the various events of the past, we must be vigilant. In fact, vigilance is not enough; it must be answered with action. What is this action? It is that we must maintain sufficient armaments in the Pacific. The Pacific is vast, and we must first maintain a sufficient navy. Although the use of atomic bombs was a factor in the recent Pacific War, it still demonstrated the importance of the navy. The peace of the Pacific was destroyed mainly due to the rise of the Japanese navy. Now that the Japanese navy has been annihilated, we cannot allow another hostile navy to rise again and destroy the peace of the Pacific; on the active side, we must reorganize our navy. In the previous Pacific War, the United States Navy fulfilled its historical mission; therefore, for the subsequent assurance of peace in the Pacific, we cannot help but place our hopes on the United States Navy, which annihilated the Japanese Navy that disrupted peace in the Pacific. Therefore, today, as we commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Pacific War, we must first express our respect to the United States Navy, and furthermore, ask the American people, for their own safety, to maintain sufficient naval power in the Pacific. As for ourselves, we must frankly say that our national strength does not allow us to possess a powerful navy, but our navy must assume an unavoidable responsibility: that is, our navy must have the power to ensure peace in the western Pacific. How can we enable our navy to fulfill this responsibility? This depends on the wise measures of our government authorities.</p>
<p>However, the military is ultimately a matter of national affairs. Those who are good at using the military do not use it, but it is essential to be prepared. Therefore, if we want to ensure peace in the Pacific, we cannot rely solely on military preparations; we must find other ways in addition to military preparations. The destruction of peace is used for war, and in the eyes of some politicians and political commentators, war is only a continuation of national policy. When conflicts in national policy cannot be resolved, they have to resort to force. This tone is more likely to come from politicians than strategists. Therefore, the key to ensuring peace lies not in strategy but in political strategy. It is the responsibility of political strategists to ensure that national policies avoid conflict. In today's world, especially in the Pacific world, we cannot but recognize the existence of divisions. Whether efforts to eliminate these divisions are futile is something that future history will write its lessons about. At this moment, we should not ask about the outcome and ignore the efforts that should be made. Today, we have the United Nations organization, which is more advanced than the League of Nations of the past. Under this international organization, we should be able to ensure lasting peace in the Pacific and even the world. There should be no disputes and conflicts that cannot be resolved. Due to the development of scientific weapons, humanity should no longer slaughter each other but be able to live together in peace.</p>
<p>On this fifth anniversary of the Pacific War, we offer our sincerest tribute to the countless heroic souls buried on the deserted islands of the Pacific, in the forests of Burma, and on the Asian continent. It is because of their sacrifice that mankind was able to overcome a cruel war. May mankind learn from this how to get along with each other so that the Pacific can ensure its eternal peace.</p>
<h3>How to Eliminate the Phenomenon of Shields</h3>
<p>Since the victory, there have been many extremely contradictory phenomena in the economic sector. Here are a few examples: (1) On the one hand, there is an excess of idle funds, inflation, and rampant speculation; on the other hand, credit is extremely tight. High interest rates cannot be reduced. (2) Cotton is in short supply, and there are calls to expedite the importation of American cotton; at the same time, the local cotton in Pudong is not being purchased, and cotton farmers are struggling to find a way out. (3) According to the Shanghai Textile Association, there is a monthly surplus of 33,682 bales of yarn, but the yarn allocation quota is only 40%, making it impossible for the re-allocation committee to manage, and the black market for cotton yarn cannot be eliminated. (4) Coal prices are soaring, and the Fuel Management Committee does not have enough coal to supply; but merchants are not allowed to freely purchase coal to replenish their reserves. (5) Unemployment fears are very serious. There are no effective measures to help them find jobs, but there are still intentional or unintentional efforts to take away their existing livelihoods. (6) Pumps can be imported, but belts are not allowed to be imported, and there are no suitable domestic products to replace them. All of this leaves many importers and users confused. (7) Scarcity makes things expensive. Kerosene prices have already risen, but there are reports that several oil tankers are still anchored outside Wusong Port, unable to enter. (8) Knowing that foreign goods are being dumped and that domestic products are unable to compete, everyone is still greedy for limited cheap goods and is unwilling to find ways to reduce production costs or to purchase domestic goods to protect them together. This is true of private individuals, and it is also true of public entities. (9) The monthly trade deficit is truly alarming, and the general domestic industry is so fragile; yet there are still people who echo and advocate free trade. (10) Prices are rising steadily, and people's livelihoods are difficult, but the prices of many goods are said to be insufficient to cover costs.</p>
<p>Faced with such a series of facts, we, as third parties, cannot help but feel dizzy. Each party involved naturally has its own reasons and its own one-sided rationale. But we believe that the above-mentioned contradictory phenomena are undoubtedly caused by these one-sided rationales. Everyone is looking out for their own interests, everyone is doing their own calculations, and while they may say nice things on the surface, they are meticulously calculating every penny and unwilling to budge an inch. In that case, how can these contradictory phenomena be eliminated?</p>
<p>Merchants seek profit from capital, and their purpose is to make a profit. As the saying goes, "Do everything, but don't do it at a loss." Of course, we cannot demand too much from them from the perspective of public welfare or charity. But we always hope that all parties will earnestly implement the laws and regulations promulgated by the government, or the temporary measures agreed upon by both officials and merchants, such as various negotiated prices and allocations, and that they will no longer harbor intentions of taking advantage or evading them.</p>
<p>As for state-owned enterprises or national economic policies, their sole purpose is not to make profits or govern the people. The overall planning and regulation of the market can be said to be their inescapable responsibility. For the above-mentioned contradictory phenomena, there is probably no other way to remedy them except by using the power of the state to adjust surpluses and deficits and to find ways to compensate for them. Especially the issues of materials and prices. We certainly hope that the authorities will have a clear and well-defined plan. However, these issues are all very complex and cannot be solved with a few empty words or by taking from the east to supplement the west. If controls are to be implemented, there must be a complete plan and a systematic approach; and considerable sacrifices must be made in terms of manpower and resources. To give an example, the United States and Hong Kong provide considerable subsidies for certain low-priced items under rationing, and they do not require merchants to bear excessive losses. This alone shows that managing price controls or rationing is not an easy task.</p>
<p>We believe that if something can be controlled, it should be controlled comprehensively. From production to consumption, there must be appropriate coordination and close links, and no one should be allowed to take advantage of any loopholes. Fragmented implementation is not allowed. If everything cannot be grasped and it is actually impossible to plan overall, then it is better to adopt a laissez-faire attitude and let them seek natural adjustment. Otherwise, dealing with things piecemeal will only cause more disturbances, and the various contradictory phenomena will become even more pronounced.</p>
<h3>US Troops on the Beining Line to Be Completely Withdrawn Within a Month: Official Announcement by the US Military Authorities</h3>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 6th] The US military authorities here announced today: The US troops responsible for protecting the railway on the Beining Line will withdraw within the next two weeks before the end of this month. The first and second battalions of the 7th Regiment will be transferred from Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe back to the west coast of the United States. There have been no US troops in Tangshan since September 30. After this withdrawal of US troops, there will only be US troops stationed in Peiping, Tianjin, Tanggu, and Tsingtao in North China. The mission of the US troops in Peiping, Tianjin, and Tanggu will be to maintain the supply line for the US representatives of the Peiping Executive Headquarters. The US troops stationed in Tsingtao belong to the 7th Fleet, and they are training Chinese naval officers there. Except for Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe, the remaining US troops on the Beining Line were completely withdrawn in mid-October, and the railway line was taken over by the National Army. After the withdrawal of the 7th Regiment, the number of US troops from the 1st Marine Division remaining in North China will be less than 15,000. The 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment is stationed in Peiping, the 1st and 2nd Regiments and the division headquarters are stationed in Tianjin, the 1st Battalion of the 5th Regiment is stationed in Tanggu, and the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Regiment is stationed in Tsingtao.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 6th] An American observer here told a United Press reporter today: After the withdrawal of US troops from Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe, the CCP will still demand the continued withdrawal of the remaining US troops in North China. It is said that the US troops stationed in China are good propaganda material for the CCP, especially since the anti-American sentiment incited by the CCP has reached a climax. According to a US source, it is expected that the Communist Party may use this withdrawal of US troops to promote the idea that the United States has realized that it was wrong to station troops on the Beining Line and is now correcting its past mistakes.</p>

<h3>Daqing Railway Under Repair: Liulihegou Railway Soon to Be Open for Coal Transport</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang News] The Daqing Railway is being urgently repaired. The Pinghan Railway Bureau has set a deadline of one month to complete the traffic from Xinxiang to Jiaozuo (65 kilometers) as soon as possible and may extend it to Qinghua (Bo'ai). The Railway Bureau has now sent five engineers to Xinxiang to assist in the work, and the materials for repairing the railway will also arrive soon. According to a senior official of the Xinxiang Railway, work will begin as soon as the materials for repairing the railway arrive, and it has been decided that both sides will repair the railway from both ends. Because 8,000 rails were found between Jiaozuo, the Jiaozuo side has already started work first. One large Type 2-8-2 locomotive that was destroyed by the Communist army in Xiuwu has been ordered to be repaired, and more than 30 military cars may be used. There is now a large quantity of coal in the Jiaozuo coal mine. Once traffic is restored, it can be transported out in a steady stream.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang News] According to reports, the entire Fengli Railway, which is 36 kilometers long, was completely repaired by the railway engineering team at 5:00 PM on November 30. A test run was conducted on the first of this month, and the situation was still good. It can be opened for coal transport soon. From then on, there will be no worry about coal for industrial use in northern Henan, and the coal problem for locomotives on the Pinghan and Longhai lines will also be solved. Now the Xinxiang Power Plant is actively sorting out the lines. After the coal is transported, it can shine brightly. According to visitors, the Liulihegou coal mine was damaged by the Communist army, causing the mine shafts to be eroded by water, and most of the mining machinery was taken away. Although a batch of mining machinery was found in the territory of Cixian a few days ago, it cannot be pumped because the power supply was destroyed. The repair work is quite difficult. Li Guangyao, the commissioner for receiving the Liulihegou coal mine, who is currently staying in Anyang, is about to go to receive and rectify it.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Cables Jiangsu Provincial Government: Military Grain Must Not Be Delayed; Zhenjiang Garrison District Clarifies Conscription Rumors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 6th] Chairman Chiang cabled an order yesterday to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to allocate military grain in accordance with quotas and deliver it to the supply stations as scheduled, and not to delay it. If the supply of military grain in the Xuhai, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui areas is interrupted, the cause should be identified and remedied immediately. If there are any cases of arrears or delayed collection, it should be explained clearly within ten days of the cable's arrival. If there is any further delay, it will be treated as delaying military opportunities. After receiving the cable, the Provincial Government urgently cabled all counties to quickly deliver the November military grain quota. [Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 6th] After the implementation of the first phase of conscription in Jiangsu, due to the uneven quality of the enforcement personnel or improper procedures, there were inevitably some disturbances, resulting in disputes in some counties. It is reported that the highest conscription agency has issued strict warnings. If anyone takes the opportunity of conscription to extort, harass the people, or abuse recruits, they will be sentenced to death upon investigation. It is learned that the original quota for conscription in Zhenjiang was 466, and 240 have now been accepted by the garrison district. Among them, there are quite a few only sons from poor families, whose families applied for a postponement of conscription in accordance with the law, but were not approved. According to the responsible authority, this matter is still under consideration.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang News] The conscription affairs in this county have been successfully completed so far. However, it was rumored in the city a few days ago that some recruits who had joined the army had escaped or committed suicide. For this reason, our newspaper reporter specifically visited a person in charge of the garrison district. According to him, the recruits' lives are very comfortable after joining the army, and there have been no adverse incidents. There are now many counties that are obstructing the conscription process, which is purely due to ulterior motives. It is hoped that the families of all recruits will not easily believe the rumors from the outside world and cause anxiety. If any traitors deliberately create rumors and cause trouble, they will be prosecuted for undermining military service once discovered.</p>

<h3>Flying Thief Li Shengwu to be Sentenced Today: During Public Trial, He Compared Himself to a Benevolent Person, Claiming His Stolen Gains Were Used to Aid the Poor</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinan] The case of flying thief Li Shengwu, which caused a sensation in Jinan society, has been investigated by the Jinan District Court for several sessions. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, at 2:00 PM, it was publicly tried in the court's criminal division. The trial concluded around 5:00 PM, and the sentencing was scheduled for the 7th of this month. During the trial, Li confessed to all thefts without hesitation, but stated that two points needed explanation: first, he did not intend to kill Xue Gan臣's mother and wife; second, although he committed theft, the stolen funds were all donated to the Jinan Relief Institute and orphanages under the name of an anonymous person. He requested the court to investigate. The defendant's lawyer, Xu Qinglin, made a defense favorable to the defendant, divided into three points: (1) The defendant did not collaborate with the enemy during the enemy-puppet period, nor did he join the bandits. He came to Jinan alone and faced difficulties in obtaining food and clothing. His stealing behavior was perhaps due to being forced by life's circumstances and is indeed excusable. (2) Regarding the defendant's killing of Xue Gan臣's mother and wife, it was found that the defendant and Xue were old friends, but Xue arrested Li and imprisoned him. Li later escaped. According to the defendant, he went to Xue's house to explain, but Xue's mother and wife pretended to comfort him at the time, possibly with the intention of alerting the authorities. He could not have escaped without killing them. (3) Regarding the defendant shooting Li Qinlu, with the defendant's skill, killing him would have been as easy as turning his hand, but Li only shot him in the leg and foot, clearly indicating no intention to kill. He requested the court to reduce his sentence.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Chamber of Commerce Appeals for Exemption from Rental Income Tax</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wuxi] The local Direct Tax Bureau has launched five income taxes: (1) income from managing and building businesses, (2) income from salaries and remuneration, (3) interest income from deposits, (4) income from property rentals, and (5) comprehensive income. After further negotiations between the Chamber of Commerce and the Tax Bureau regarding the above taxes, requests for reduction or exemption have not been met. Among them, the property rental income tax is particularly in conflict with the local house tax. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce believes it is absolutely inappropriate. In addition to sending a letter to the Tax Bureau with earnest appeals, on the 4th, they also sent telegrams on behalf of the Nanjing National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Assembly, the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and the local National Assembly representatives Jiang Mingjian, Xu Chizi, Li Tiping, and Sun Xiangfeng, appealing for a halt to the tax collection.</p>

No one is responsible for the reception of refugees in various provincial capital reception centers and the relief of scattered refugees. A telegram was sent to the provincial government requesting prompt allocation of funds to support the station for its maintenance. (2) The provincial capital's winter relief program was requested from the provincial government to be implemented promptly via telegram. (3) A telegram was sent urging the Suning Branch Office to quickly issue winter clothing to the refugees in Zhenjiang to protect them from the severe winter. (4) Although some cities in various counties and cities in northern Jiangsu have been recovered, the order in the rural areas has not yet stabilized. The number of refugees returning home is minimal. It is requested that the refugee repatriation station be abolished, and any repatriation matters be handled by the Zhenjiang Working Team.</p>

<h3>Vegetable Stalls in Pudong Have Been Restored to Their Original State</h3>
<p>To the Editor: On November 25th, I submitted a letter requesting the police department to restore the vegetable stalls in Pudong to their original state. Now, because permission has been obtained from the police department, the stalls have been restored to their original state on the 29th, which the public considers to be convenient. However, your newspaper published the letter one day earlier, so please correct this. (Chen Haosheng et al.)</p>
<h3>When Will the Ordered Clothes Be Made?</h3>
<p>The Public Education Personnel Supplies Distribution Office decided to provide moulton cloth to be distributed, and considering the high labor costs, offered to make the clothes on our behalf, requiring only a payment of 30,000 yuan. However, it has been almost a month since November 8th, and there is no news about the clothes. It is hoped that the office will consider the poor civil servants suffering in the cold weather these days and expedite the making of the clothes. (A Teacher)</p>
<h3>Fanhwangdu Road Urgently Needs Repair</h3>
<p>The municipal authorities are renovating the city's appearance and facilitating transportation, with all roads being repaired one after another. However, Fanhwangdu Road (the section from Wujiaochang to Sanjiaochang) has not been attended to. This road is also a major transportation route with heavy traffic. The damage to the road surface is unbelievable. Whenever it rains, the mud is ankle-deep, and passersby are full of complaints. Now that the rainy and snowy season has arrived, the mud on the road surface may never dry. We residents of this section are also taxpayers and it seems the municipal authorities disregard the road condition. (Xin Yong respectfully submitted)</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Road Bridge Needs Urgent Repair</h3>
<p>The wooden bridge on Jiaxing Road in Hongkou East should have been repaired long ago. The Public Works Bureau has placed wooden barriers at both ends of the bridge, giving the appearance that repairs will begin, but it has been almost a year with no action taken. At night, thieves steal the bridge planks, and the holes are getting larger every day. Pedestrians find it difficult to pass, and rickshaws often fall (there are no streetlights on this road), obstructing traffic and harming appearances, which is a significant issue. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention and expedite the repairs to facilitate transportation. (Sun Wenbing)</p>
<h3>Substitute Mailing</h3>

We are replying accordingly.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Wu Peng: Regarding your letter appealing about someone impersonating a military officer and causing injury with an idle gun, we have received a letter from the Air Force General Headquarters stating: "After investigation, there is no Chen Jianshuo or Chen Guilin among the personnel of our army at all levels. It is obvious that someone is impersonating an Air Force officer to defraud, which is illegal. We have already sent a letter to the Pinghu County Judicial Office in Zhejiang Province, ordering them to strictly arrest Chen Jianshuo and bring him to justice." We are replying accordingly.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Tang Jingxiong: Regarding your letter pointing out that a road police officer at Wuxi Station kicked a passenger, we have received a letter from the Police Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration stating: "Road police officers are not allowed to abuse or insult passengers, and this has been repeatedly emphasized and strictly prohibited by our department.

<p>[News Report] San Francisco, 6th (Broadcast): Byrnes urged the other three foreign ministers today to sign peace treaties with Germany's five former satellite states before Christmas, so that this year's Christmas will be a truly peaceful Christmas. Byrnes also proposed to begin discussing the German peace treaty starting next week.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 5th] The four foreign ministers, in a spirit of coordination, resolved all major outstanding issues in the five-nation peace treaties today. Except for a few technical and minor issues that can be quickly resolved by the representatives of the four foreign ministers, the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Finland have been definitely agreed upon. The four foreign ministers are expected to begin discussing the German issue around Monday of next week. The representatives of the four foreign ministers and the four foreign ministers themselves will hold meetings one after another tomorrow to review the final reports submitted by economic and naval experts. The time and place for the signing of the treaties have not yet been determined. Since the final texts need to be produced in English, French, and Russian, they will not be signed in New York, as the chief representatives will all be leaving New York early. The four foreign ministers agreed on the following aspects today:</p>
<p>(1) "The Danube River Issue": Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov agreed to insert a clause on the freedom of navigation on the Danube River into the Romanian treaty. This clause stipulates that an international conference will be convened within six months after the treaty comes into effect to draft a permanent convention. (2) "The Reparations Issue": Italy will pay $125 million in reparations to Yugoslavia, $105 million to Greece, and $25 million each to Abyssinia and Albania. Bulgaria will pay $25 million each in reparations to Yugoslavia and Greece. Regarding the proportion of compensation for wartime losses of Allied nationals, the Paris Conference recommended compensating 75% of the original value, which has now been reduced to two-thirds. (3) "The Romanian Oil Price Issue": The four foreign ministers adopted yesterday's procedure, that is, the governments of the countries concerned should first negotiate directly. If they cannot reach an agreement, the ambassadors of the four powers will continue to discuss. If they still cannot reach an agreement, the Secretary-General of the United Nations will appoint an arbitrator to make the final decision.</p>
<p>Other points agreed upon were: (1) the Soviet Union does not object to the right of the Trieste Free Territory to join international organizations; (2) former enemy countries are prohibited from using torpedo boats; (3) if Yugoslavia refuses to sign the treaty, it will be deprived of its due benefits.</p>
<h3>International Control of Atomic Energy: US Representative Proposes New Plan, Hoping the Soviet Union Will Participate in Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 5th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission met today, chaired by French Representative Parodi. In his opening remarks, he stated briefly that the commission is an independent body and that any decisions made by the UN General Assembly's Political and Security Committee should not interfere with the commission's resolutions. British Representative Shawcross spoke next, stating briefly, "Establishing an international organization to strengthen the control of atomic energy and promoting the application of atomic energy to peaceful goals is an urgent task. We urgently hope to lift all curtains and open all doors to enhance the effectiveness of this control. Our greatest hope is that all countries, including the Soviet Union, will agree with our views." At this point, US Representative Baruch put forward a control plan, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Establish an international atomic energy management system, the definition and function of which shall be determined by a multilateral treaty. In this treaty, all countries are equal. (2) The management system shall take effect after a majority of countries ratify the treaty. (3) The treaty must stipulate the appointment of an international organization within the United Nations framework to enable countries to exchange information on atomic research, prohibit the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes, and at the same time promote the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. (4) The organization should seek convenience in carrying out control work in various countries' territories, prohibit the production, possession, and use of atomic weapons, trace violators, consider the international crimes constituted by violators, and decide the nature of the punishment for violating countries. (5) The supervisory organization shall not use the veto power when investigating cases of violation, so as to prevent the violating party from evading punishment. (6) The Atomic Energy Commission should include this plan in its report to the Security Council at the end of this year.</p>
<p>When proposing this plan, Baruch earnestly hoped for the participation of the Soviet Union and said, "We can accomplish the control of atomic weapons if we wish. The complete elimination of war is in our hands, and we are willing to work with you to achieve it."</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] According to reliable British sources, the Soviet Ambassador to Iran has verbally issued an ultimatum to Iranian Prime Minister Sultaneh, stating that the Soviet Union views any attempt by Iran to send troops to the Azerbaijan province as a joint effort by Britain and the United States to establish a base in Iran.

<h3>France's New Prime Minister Difficult to Produce: Bidault Fails in Second Vote</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] After Communist leader Thorez failed to be appointed Prime Minister yesterday due to insufficient votes, the National Assembly held a second election today. However, Bidault of the Popular Republican Movement also failed to obtain the required number of votes, receiving only 240. During the vote, the Popular Republican Movement and the conservatives supported Bidault, but the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Radical Party all opposed him, choosing their own candidate, Betti te. The National Assembly will hold a third prime ministerial election next Tuesday. It is expected that the parties will seek a compromise solution under the auspices of Speaker Auriol over the weekend to resolve the government crisis as soon as possible. It is generally expected that the position of Prime Minister should belong to the Socialist Party or the Radical Party, and the government should include all parties except the Republican Liberty Party and the far-right parties. Gouin of the Socialist Party and Herriot of the Radical Party are considered ideal candidates for Prime Minister. Experienced observers believe that such a government would be more stable.</p>

<h3>Five US Congressmen Arrived in Shanghai from Peiping Yesterday: Discussing Peace in the Pacific is Peace in the World</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Isaac, Chairman of the Naval Subcommittee of the US House of Representatives, accompanied by Congressmen Beemiller, Bishap, Hurley, and Mansfield, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping by plane at 11:30 yesterday morning. At 3:00 yesterday afternoon, a reception was held for reporters at the Hua Mao Hotel, with US Seventh Fleet Commander Admiral Cooke in attendance. Congressman Mansfield did not attend due to other commitments.</p>
<p>During the reception, Congressman Isaac reported on the mission of this trip, which was to complete the work of inspecting the Pacific islands and visiting various parts of China last year. Mr. Isaac and others visited the Pacific islands in June and July last year, when Wake Island and other places were still under Japanese control. This time, they came to the Far East again and visited Qingdao, Tianjin, and Peiping in China. They will leave Shanghai on the 8th for Okinawa Island and then Manila, and are expected to return to the United States in early January next year to report to the House of Representatives. The purpose of their inspection is not only to understand the situation of US military bases for US reference, but also to make an observation for international peace. Mr. Isaac gave his personal opinion, saying: "I deeply feel that there is a close and good relationship between China and the United States. If China and the United States work together side by side, it will not be difficult to maintain peace in the Pacific. At the same time, I can guarantee that peace in the Pacific is a guarantee of peace in the world."</p>
<p>When a reporter asked Mr. Isaac which country the US military was establishing bases in the Pacific to defend against, Mr. Isaac replied: "It is to defend against any country that wants to destroy the world peace of the next five thousand years. The establishment of bases is not a plan for three or five years."</p>
<p>Mr. Isaac continued: In addition to establishing a complete administrative area, the US military in the Pacific islands also has a humanitarian mission, that is, the US military should protect and assist the residents of the islands, and implement its promise in accordance with the consistent policy of the United States, leading the natives to independence and autonomy, such as the construction of a new country in the Philippines. Mr. Isaac deeply fears that the US Congress will decide to cut the navy and repeat historical tragedies. Mr. Isaac believes that the navy is a great force for maintaining peace, and if it is reduced, it will affect security. He also said that China and other countries recognize the Pacific as the US ocean, and the United States has a very large mission in the Pacific. Mr. Isaac denied that the US Navy has any bases in China, saying that Shanghai is not a base, and Qingdao can be called a temporary base, but in fact Qingdao is China's naval base. At the request of the Chinese government, the US Navy has a naval training school there, and there are currently a number of US naval officers teaching at the school. The United States is willing to do its best to help China.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Isaac also answered reporters' questions about the policy toward Japan, which is to assist the Japanese people in taking the path of true democracy, allowing the Japanese people to strive for freedom of speech, action, and various freedoms. Judging from the current situation, the Japanese people are not dissatisfied with the policies implemented by the United States in Japan.</p>
<h3>Factory Range Temporarily Divided into Three Zones; Yesterday's Municipal Meeting Passed Management Rules</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] In order to facilitate the supervision of factories in this city and protect the safety of citizens, the Municipal Government has formulated the Shanghai Municipal Rules for the Management of Factory Site Addresses. It is stipulated that the range of factories to be established in this city is temporarily divided into three types of areas: A, B, and C. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Zone A: Permanent factories may be established, and the scope is defined as follows: (3) The first zone is in the Caobajdu Suzhou Creek area (bounded by the railway to the north, Kangding Road to the south, and Suzhou Creek to the east of St. John's University). (2) The second zone is 2,000 meters west of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and the three sections of land along the Suzhou Creek to the west, the scope of which is: (A) North of Suzhou Creek: 1,000 meters north to the east, 1,100 meters north to the west, and the connecting line within the scope.

<p>The above measures have been approved by yesterday's municipal meeting and will be announced and implemented soon.</p>
<h3>The O'Hare Bureau Suspects War Criminals; Regardless of Guilt or Innocence, All Will Be Repatriated for Reception; Increased Income May Be Tried Again</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The second batch of German overseas Chinese deportation list has been announced by the authorities, but because it includes the O'Hare Bureau suspected war criminals who are currently being tried by the US military court, the deportation date will be determined after the court has completed its trial and judgment. According to the 27 defendants of the O'Hare Bureau, except for Shen Ke and other six people who have been acquitted, the rest are still in the witness testimony stage, which will take about two weeks. According to Prosecutor Major O'Connor yesterday, all defendants, regardless of whether they are convicted or acquitted, will be deported to Germany for execution, release, or other disposition. Because the "Purge of Nazi Elements Court" has been established in the US-occupied zone of Germany since the end of the war, specializing in the trial of lower-level officials of the Hitler government, secret police, and other Nazis, even if the O'Hare Bureau defendant is declared innocent by the US military court here, they may still be tried again by the court after returning to the country.</p>
<h3>Chinese-Style Dance Drama is Maturing: "Meng Jiang Nu's" Techniques a Success, Paving a New Path for Chinese Art</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Ah Fu Shamulov's "Meng Jiang Nu" has premiered, which is welcome news.</p>
<p>Regardless of the differing opinions and various criticisms from the audience, it is an undeniable fact that Mr. Ah has found a new way of performing and a new "tool" (Medium) for conveying art for Chinese art. Today, Kunqu Opera has gradually become a thing of the past with the decline of "literati and scholars." As for Peking Opera, although the lineup at Shanghai's Peking Opera theaters is still at its peak, it is sadly a case of "a final burst of glory." May I ask, even with Mei Lanfang's skillful leadership, will there ever be eternal youth? What is likely to take its place are the colorful lights of the Gong Stage and the seductive gestures of female performers!</p>
<p>Reforming Peking Opera has yet to achieve significant results. On the contrary, "popular literature" is gradually rising to prominence and achieving considerable success. Dai Ailian's experimentation has given us a very fresh impression, and her success lies in her finding a new path from popular literature and folk art.</p>
<p>Art cannot be separated from the masses.</p>
<p>In fact, the attempt to adapt Chinese folk tales into opera is not without precedent in our art circles. As far as this writer knows, during the period of Japanese occupation in Beiping and Tianjin, there were already people working diligently to adapt "Mulan Joins the Army" into an opera. Unfortunately, Wang Shouhui, who diligently wrote the lyrics, did not complete his work and died young in frustration! At the same time, Ah Fu Shamulov first attempted a Chinese-style dance drama and achieved unprecedented success. This dance drama was "A Dream in an Ancient Temple." From the success of "A Dream in an Ancient Temple," those who care about the future of Chinese art predicted that Chinese-style opera was gradually taking shape. Sure enough, today we see "Meng Jiang Nu." The composition of "Meng Jiang Nu" does inevitably have its shortcomings. Even though Mr. Ah has been in China for decades, even though he has a great love for Chinese music and has put in a lot of effort, music is a cry from the deepest part of a nation's soul, fleeting and elusive, yet clear as day. A slight error in judgment will lead to a huge difference. Not to mention previous works such as "In a Chinese Temple," Mr. Ah's efforts give us the same feeling as Pearl S. Buck's Chinese characters—they only grasp the outline and not the substance; they have types, but no individuality. How many associations should the word "Suzhou" evoke in the heart of a Chinese person? Even if Mr. Ah works hard, how many associations can he make? What we pay attention to and admire is the technique. Thirty years ago, the Spring Willow Society staged "La Dame aux Camélias." Today, our spoken drama has gained a firm foothold. We firmly believe that this "Meng Jiang Nu" will have the same effect as "La Dame aux Camélias" in the past, and will spark continuous efforts leading to brilliant achievements in the future. We must start with "popular literature," and it is we Chinese who should take on this responsibility.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the previous Council decided to lease the Hardoon Garden on Weihaiwei Road as a park for this city, it has been discovered that the garden has started construction without a license.

<h3>Opening Roads: Demolishing Houses; Compensation Fee Draft Approved by the Municipal Council Public Works Committee</h3>
<p>In order to widen the road system in Shanghai and the existing small roads in the Chinese district, the Municipal Public Works Bureau's preliminary plan stipulates that all types of houses that have exceeded the safe age limit should be demolished. The first to be demolished are those exceeding the safe age limit on roads such as Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Tianjin Road, Ningbo Road, Jiangxi Road, Henan Road, Shandong Road, and Shanxi Road in the downtown area of ​​the Central District. As for the demolition of houses due to road construction, and the regulations for giving compensation fees, the calculation method has been drafted and submitted to the fourth meeting of the Municipal Council Public Works Committee yesterday for revision and approval, and sent to the Rules and Regulations Committee for review.

(2) The estimation of the compensation for the demolition of houses is calculated according to the valuation of the house, according to the depreciation percentage. (A) The valuation of the house is calculated according to the original construction price assumed in the 26th year of the Republic of China, according to the cost of living index of workers in this city at the time of demolition. (B) The depreciation percentage is calculated according to the ratio of the safe age limit of the house to the years it has been built. The safe age limit of various houses will be determined separately. (Two) All demolished old materials will still be recovered by the owner. (3) For houses that have been demolished and have exceeded the safe age limit, the amount of compensation due for the last year of the safe age limit will be given.

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau to Implement This Month: Registering Unemployed Workers; Providing Job Introductions Based on Their Skills and Aspirations</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told our reporter yesterday: The registration of unemployed workers will be implemented this month. After registration, job introductions will be provided based on their skills and aspirations. All preparations have been completed, and the forms have also been printed. The only difficulty is that the forms require photos, and the unemployed workers cannot afford to take them. From January to November this year, the Unemployed Workers Guidance Committee issued three batches of relief flour; the first batch benefited 71,500 people, the second batch benefited 78,439 people, and the third batch benefited 59,181 people. 2,461 unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear were relieved by the committee, of which 1,805 lived in the committee's reception center. In addition, there were 111 unemployed overseas workers who returned to the country and were also among those who were relieved. In addition to the three batches of relief flour, the committee also has a batch of surplus flour, which will be used this winter to relieve the families of poor unemployed workers. As for the relief of unemployed workers this winter, Mr. Li believes that there are two ways: (1) Establish cooperative factories, which is being prepared. (2) Negotiate with the Public Utilities Bureau to implement work-for-relief, using unemployed workers to work on road repairs and other work. However, Mr. Li's personal opinion is that many of these unemployed workers are skilled workers, and some are from military factories. It is inevitable that they will not be used for their strengths if they are made to do rough work such as road repairs. As for the total number of unemployed workers in this city, Mr. Li previously estimated it to be around 60,000. After the police bureau investigated, it proved that this estimate was very accurate.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Union Re-election: Special Envoy System to be Abolished, Future Tasks to Focus on Developing the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The purpose of the Chinese Seamen's Union in convening this National Congress of Representatives is to elect directors and supervisors in accordance with democratic principles and establish a seamen's union of their own.

Mr. Wang kindly gave a talk, summarizing the historical background, internal organization, and tasks of this congress as follows: In the sixth year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, Chinese seamen and overseas Chinese serving on foreign merchant ships, feeling resentful of the _______ of foreign seamen, deeply felt the need for Chinese seamen to communicate with each other and take concerted action, and thus formed an informal trade union. Later, seamen in the North China Tianjin area also united with each other, forming groups. However, due to personnel and regional relations, they mostly acted independently and failed to unify. After the 20th year of the Republic of China, the central government considered the shipping industry to be not only a national undertaking but also a foreign affair, and thus merged the various seamen's organizations in the past to establish the Chinese Seamen's Union, appointing Yang Xiaotian as a special envoy. Mr. Yang had a long-standing relationship with Chinese seamen and was a protagonist in the _______ peace talks, so seamen from the north and south deeply supported him without any objection. Not long after the union was established, the August 13th Incident occurred, and the union followed the war inland, from Shanghai to Hankou, from Hankou to Chongqing, and also established an office in Hong Kong. On the one hand, it actively expanded the shipping industry, and on the other hand, it assisted seamen in the occupied areas in carrying out anti-Japanese work. After eight years of hardship, it never slackened. After the victory, it actively prepared for repatriation. The order of repatriation was: (1) Those who followed the war inland and continued to engage in the shipping industry with meritorious service. (2) Those who followed the war inland and changed industries. (3) Those who resided in the occupied areas and did not work with the enemy puppets. (4) Those who were compelled by livelihood to supply the enemy puppets. Since the preparation for repatriation, many people have registered from various places. It is estimated that there will be representatives from 23 places in China and 13 places abroad attending this congress. The presidium of the congress will consist of seven people, with labor representatives occupying three seats. Labor representatives will also occupy two-thirds of the elected directors and supervisors. Individuals with a history of engaging in the shipping industry will be appointed. After the election of directors and supervisors, the county-appointed envoy system will be abolished, and the union will become a formal public association. The task from then on will be to closely contact all seamen, actively develop the shipping industry, _______, so as to meet the needs of the seamen's welfare undertaking, and strive to improve the status of Chinese seamen, so as to seek equality with the status of seamen from all countries in the world.</p>

(2) Improving the production and quality of raw cotton. (3) Hoping that the government will ban the mixing of raw cotton with hemp. (4) Seeking a site for the association's office in this city.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants' Cotton Stocks: Deadline for Reporting</h3>
<p>After the Textile Industry Management Committee handled the registration of cotton stocks in this city, each yarn mill has submitted detailed reports in separate tables on the 5th. Now, because foreign merchants have not yet reported their cotton stocks to the committee, the exact number of cotton stocks in the city has not yet been obtained. The committee has separately notified foreign merchants engaged in the cotton industry that they must report their cotton stocks by the 7th of this month. Overdue reports will be investigated. It is reported that the committee's registration of cotton stocks this time is to understand the cotton inventory in this city, so as to order American cotton according to actual needs.</p>
<h3>Factories Disguised Selling at Lower Prices: Yarn Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to decline. Yesterday was the deadline for factories producing reprocessed goods to pay for the allocated yarn. Generally, those with weak financial resources were selling at lower prices under disguised names in order to raise funds. Therefore, 20-count _______ fell by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and 42-count double-strand also fell by 80,000 to 110,000 yuan. Except for a slight demand from the interior, major buyers such as Guangdong, Hanzhong, Tianjin, and Hunan were all idle. Due to the sluggish finished products, 42-count double-strand lacked demand. The off-market asking prices were: 42-count blue _______ 4.9 million yuan, 20-count Bianma 2.28 million yuan, 32-count _______ 3.1 million yuan, 20-count special double-horse 2.55 million yuan.</p>

<h3>The Truth About the Insufficient Yarn Allocation for the Handkerchief Industry</h3>
<p>Recently, cotton cloth prices have been slightly flat, but the cotton yarn situation is still tight. The other day (the 5th), the Bureau of Social Affairs summoned responsible persons from the cotton cloth industry to inquire about the actual situation of the cloth market. It was said that cloth prices have risen in the past ten days compared to before, but they have not exceeded the negotiated prices, and the fancy cloth is not even enough to cover the cost. It was said that the cloth opened by Textile Construction yesterday had no profit to be heard. According to news from the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, the yarn allocation is indeed insufficient and the cloth price should be stable. It has notified all member factories to understand the current difficulties and jointly maintain the market. The Handkerchief Industry Association has long expressed dissatisfaction with the double discount of 60% on the yarn allocation and intends to petition for remedies. However, according to news from the Textile Management Committee and the Reprocessing Committee, when Mayor Wu decided on the quota in late October, the industry did not attend. The Textile Management Committee, based on the telephone report of its responsible person, allocated the quota by default, and this allocation was only in accordance with the uniform discount of 60% for each industry, but the number reported by the industry's telephone report was later known to have already been discounted by 60%, resulting in a double discount error. At the first yarn allocation in the fourth period, the person in charge of the Reprocessing Committee had proposed to first allocate a certain amount from the total to make up for the loss of this double discount, but the representative of the Handkerchief Industry Association said that each industry felt that it was insufficient and was unwilling to "cut flesh to mend sores", resulting in the launch of a petition. It is heard that the Reprocessing Committee is scheduled to convene a meeting today (the 7th) to resolve this dispute.</p>
<h3>Optimistic About the Future of China's Cotton Spinning Industry: One Million Newly Ordered Spindles Will Soon Arrive in China; Strong Domestic Demand and Weak Competitiveness of Japanese Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] A textile expert told this reporter that the spinning spindles ordered by China's textile industry in the United Kingdom and the United States are estimated to be more than one million spindles. Those who ordered them are all large-scale capital groups, such as the Bank of China system, the Bank of Communications system, and the Shenxin system. Most of the spindles are ordered in the United Kingdom, and a small portion in the United States; the reason is that the depreciation rate of British spindles is smaller and the use period is longer, while American spindles are too new. With China's current industrial environment, their use is not very suitable. At the same time, the British spinning machines used to supply the entire European continent, but now the European market has shrunk, so there is surplus capacity to supply China's needs. It is also learned that China placed orders very early, so if there are no unexpected reasons in the past six months, the new machines will be shipped to China one after another, and China's textile industry will have a new look. However, if the supply of raw cotton relies on American cotton, it will consume too much foreign exchange. National cotton, on the other hand, is small in quantity and difficult to concentrate due to military and transportation relations. At the same time, there are also quality problems, because after American cotton is transplanted to China, the cotton fibers become short due to geology and cultivation, which is most suitable for spinning coarse yarn of 20 to 32 counts, and fine yarn of 40 counts or more is not applicable. As for the overseas competition of China's cotton spinning industry, he believes that the number of spindles opened by Japan is no more than 2.5 million, and the products are also in high demand domestically. It is possible that the Japanese yarn previously reported to be transported to Hong Kong was the pre-war inventory. Moreover, the United States currently has 18 million yarn spindles, with extremely high production efficiency. Its cotton cloth is currently still supplying the domestic needs and has not been exported overseas in large quantities. It is predicted that when it exports in large quantities next year, it may cause pressure on the Chinese market.</p>
<h3>Customs Ordered to Continue Implementing Restrictions on Rice and Grain for Export and Transit: To be Lifted When the Situation Permits</h3>
<p>For merchants to report rice and grain for export and transit from Shanghai Customs, they should submit two or more documents, such as invoices from rice merchants in the producing area or certificates from industry associations, as well as ship and railway transport documents. At the same time, they should also submit a certificate from the Ministry of Food. After verification by the Customs, they will be allowed to pass. The effective period of the above measures expired at the end of November. The Customs recently received an order from the Executive Yuan that the aforementioned measures restricting the reporting of rice and grain for export and transit from Shanghai should continue to be implemented and should be lifted when the situation permits. After receiving the order, the Customs has notified the implementation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Oil Prices Continue to Fall: Rice Market Generally Firm and Stable</h3>

<h3>Tunxi Newly Extracted Superior Grade: Tongfu Absorbed 28 Boxes</h3>
<p>The foreign merchants' tea market, although there was some absorption of India and other places recently, it was difficult to fulfill due to the scarcity of ships. If the high _______ Chen Qimen, which is thinly stocked in the market, is bought by British export banks, there will be no success. As for green tea such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, which are sold to Africa and Morocco, those with inferior quality are still difficult to sell. This year's new tea, however, has long been lonely in foreign sales due to the different domestic and foreign selling prices. Tea merchants in this city are still trying to remedy the situation. At present, Tongfu Foreign Company has absorbed 28 boxes of newly extracted precious grade from Tunxi Road, priced at 360,000 yuan per dan. As soon as the shipping date arrives, it will be loaded and exported. Domestic sales of red and green tea are unremarkable.</p>

<h3>Sericulture Crisis Serious; Raw Silk Guild Directors to Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>This year, the sericulture industry in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is in extreme difficulty and cannot be sustained. The raw silk guilds of the three regions have submitted requests to the central government ministries for relief. Furthermore, the chairman of the guild, Chu Fucheng, and acting director Leng Di, taking advantage of their attendance at the National Assembly, first reported to the central authorities the current difficulties of the silk industry. According to news from the raw silk (three regions) guilds, they received a letter from Chu Fucheng in Beijing yesterday (the 5th). Chu reported the current situation of the industry in detail at the chairman's banquet for the National Assembly representatives. The chairman then instructed that concrete measures for silk and tea export relief would be announced in the coming year. After receiving the instruction, Chu wrote to the directors in Shanghai, urging them to go to Beijing within ten days to visit the heads of the central government ministries and request relief. Today (the 6th), managing directors of the guild, Wang Huanan and Shen Juru, among others, held consultations before their departure and decided to go to Beijing on the 9th to petition.</p>
<h3>Black Market for Rayon Surfaces Again; China Trust Requests Mayor to Crack Down</h3>
<p>China Trust Bureau distributes rayon to manufacturers on a progressively increasing basis. The distribution procedure has been changed to distribute to the electrical machinery industry every Monday and to the weaving, knitting, and dyeing industries every Thursday, still distributing eight times per month. The first distribution for this month, originally scheduled for this Monday, was slightly delayed in application by various industries and was specially combined with the second distribution on the 5th. It is reported that 208 electrical machinery companies applied for 580 cases, including 518 cases of Takayama rayon, priced at 2.75 million yuan per case, and 62 cases of Toyo rayon, priced at 2.7 million yuan. The number of applicants and quantities requested by the weaving and knitting industries have been registered and sent to the bureau and will be distributed after verification. The next distribution should be soon. The dyeing and weaving industries have not yet applied. Hangzhou requested 400 cases for this month, which have already been shipped and entrusted to the Hangzhou branch for distribution. During the period of rayon shortage in this city, the black market price once exceeded 5 million yuan. Since the China Trust Bureau started distributing rayon in exchange for goods, the black market price has dropped to around 3 million yuan. However, recently the black market has become rampant again, with Jin San Ma rayon jumping to over 3.8 million yuan, and Xin Tian Qiao also above 3.4 million yuan. Furthermore, new goods such as Jin San Ma and Toyo rayon have appeared on the market, indicating that unscrupulous manufacturers are transferring the distributed goods to the black market for profit, which not only affects the market but also violates the bureau's distribution purpose. The bureau is a business organization and has no authority to crack down. Therefore, it has sent a letter to Mayor Wu requesting assistance in cracking down in order to maintain the market.</p>
<h3>Xin Da Silk Factory Liquidation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The silk weaving industry in this city has also been severely affected by the business depression. People in the industry have the agony of wanting to quit but being unable to do so. Under the current unfavorable conditions of high interest rates, expensive raw materials, high labor costs, and sluggish product market prices, it is impossible to avoid operating at a loss. However, on the other hand, the livelihoods of the workers must be maintained. It is reported that the liquidation of the Xin Da Silk Factory is just the beginning of the whole whirlpool. Regarding the silk weaving industry loans undertaken by the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, the loans obtained by each factory were originally limited to purchasing raw materials and providing for production. However, it has been found that the factories that obtained the loans considered it more important to repay high-interest debts than to purchase raw materials for production. Therefore, most of them used the loans to offset old debts. It is reported that the Central Bank authorities are extremely dissatisfied with this. In addition to planning to recover the loans already issued, if the factories cannot provide concrete proof of purchasing raw materials in the future, no further loans will be granted.</p>
<h3>Japanese Trade Difficult to Restore; Foreign Trading Firms Closing Down One After Another</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 5th] According to opinions of informed sources here, there is little hope for the restoration of normal trade in Japan next year or even the year after. They predict that the current situation will continue to drag on, at least until the reparations issue is resolved and a peace treaty is signed. However, when this can be achieved is difficult to guess. Therefore, foreign trading firms, except those engaged in specialized work necessary for the occupation forces, are announcing their closure one after another.</p>
<h3>London Needs Tung Oil</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The current shortage of linseed oil continues, so the demand for tung oil has seen a wider trend in the most recent week. Tung oil is known for its quick-drying properties, and for various uses such as varnishes and lacquers, it has proven to be a satisfactory substitute.</p>
<h3>U.S. Raw Silk Market; Japanese Silk Takes Top Spot</h3>

<h3>Difficult to Settle Foreign Exchange for Gasoline; American Merchants to Suspend Sales</h3>
<p>For several months, American gasoline companies such as Mobil and Texaco in this city have been unable to settle foreign exchange, so the sales proceeds cannot be remitted back to the United States. The American headquarters are very dissatisfied with this and have sent a letter warning that if the sales proceeds cannot be settled, the existing inventory in Shanghai will have to be temporarily suspended. Otherwise, supplies will be stopped.</p>
<h3>Large Pieces of Dried Longan Flesh Turn Tight</h3>
<p>The previous offering of large pieces of sun-dried longan flesh had fallen by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, but calculated at the producing price, it would have required selling at a loss. Therefore, some merchants were unwilling to sell immediately, and the recent market has slightly improved. Yesterday, the market opened at 460,000 yuan, an increase of 20,000 yuan from the previous price.</p>
<h3>Knitting Industry in Dire Straits; More Than Ten Factories Announce Closure</h3>
<p>More than ten first-class knitting factories, including Zhongguo, Taiji, Qinyi, Hua'an, Huafeng, Meiqi, and Zhongxing, have formally announced their closure due to poor business conditions and have requested the Social Affairs Bureau to dismiss their employees. It is said that the main blow to the business is the dumping of smuggled glass silk. Currently, a dozen pairs of glass silk stockings on the market sell for only 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, while the cost of a dozen pairs of domestically produced rayon stockings is 120,000 yuan, plus factory expenses, at least 150,000 yuan or more, and no one is buying them. The interior is also hopeless due to the impact of traffic wars. Currently, the knitting factories that are still operating are only working three hours a day, or three days on and two days off,勉強维持 in an effort to persuade employees to resign voluntarily and seek other employment in order to avoid huge dismissal expenses. Since the victory, most of the electrical machinery and knitting industries in this city have not resumed work. The hand-operated knitting factories, totaling about 300, have now exhausted their resources and are gradually shutting down.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Cotton Production Halved</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Chongqing, 6th] Sichuan cotton production used to be 600,000 dan per year, but now it is said to be 300,000 dan. The main reasons are poor quality and high prices, leading to sluggish sales. It is said that it is difficult to realize the improvement of American cotton because Sichuan has a lot of rain and is not easy to plant.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Cotton Importers Discuss Foreign Cotton Import Issues</h3>
<p>Chinese and foreign cotton importers in this city held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Hua An Insurance Company. Representatives from more than 30 units of Chinese, American, and Indian foreign firms attended. Ding Zhongshu, the representative of Bai Lin Foreign Firm, was elected as chairman. Ding first reported the situation of the conversation between the industry and the chairman of the Import Management Committee (輸管會). The chairman of the Import Management Committee advocated that the Spinning and Weaving Construction Company (紡建公司) should purchase all cotton and the Spinning and Weaving Management Committee (紡管會) would allocate it. The industry insisted on direct allocation to yarn factories, giving priority to old customers. The day before yesterday, representatives from American and Fu Jia Foreign Firms were also sent to the committee to negotiate, requesting leniency for goods that had been ordered by the industry and were already on their way to Shanghai. Finally, the Chinese and Indian sides nominated Ding Zhongshu of Bai Lin Foreign Firm, Huang Yuanjue of Sanwei Company, Wei Guanjunyong of Zhenxing Company, Pai Lai of Pai Lai Foreign Firm, and Da Chai of Beikait Company as representatives to maintain contact with the person in charge of the Cotton Group of the Import Industry Association, to negotiate on the release of foreign exchange for already ordered cotton and the import of Indian cotton, Egyptian cotton, and other non-American cotton. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Cultural and Educational Commission Approves 1947 Peace Education Program; Britain Proposes Establishing a World Wireless Radio University</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 5th] The subcommittee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) adopted the proposed 1947 "Peace Education Program" today by the Proposal Review Committee without debate. It is expected to be voted on by the plenary meeting tomorrow. The French representative (Director of the National Library) Kahn opposed the British scientist Huxley's proposal to publish a book on anti-war literature by UNESCO. Kahn said that this type of literature is only retrospective and not forward-looking, which is contrary to the spirit of UNESCO. Huxley replied that UNESCO has been collecting this type of literature for six months and must publish it now, otherwise it will lose its timeliness.

<h3>Self-Funded Students' Association of This City Hosted Press Yesterday; Reported on the Process of Petitioning in Beijing</h3>
<p>[Report from this city] Zhao Yihua, Ling Shuang, Cheng Jia Yin, and other three representatives of the second session of the Shanghai Self-Funded Students' Association, returned to Shanghai on the 4th. Yesterday (the 5th) at 3:30 PM, they hosted the press at the Tsinghua Alumni Association restaurant to report on the process of this trip. According to Zhao Yixin, chairman of the association, after the three representatives arrived in Beijing on the 29th of last month, they submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Finance. Secretary-General Jiang Menglin, Minister Zhu Jiahua, and Minister Yu Hongjun met with them and expressed deep sympathy for the difficulties stated by the representatives. The representatives also appealed to the National Assembly and Special Envoy Marshall, requesting assistance. The National Assembly was received by Zhu Jingnong, Pan Gongzhan, and Wu Shaoshu, who promised to convey the opinions raised by the representatives to the relevant parties. Special Envoy Marshall agreed to serve as an advisor to the association. As for the various requests made by the association: (1) The Ministry of Education agreed to extend the departure deadline, and the Ministry of Education agreed to decide after one year whether it is necessary. (2) Three copies of the English admission certificate can be reissued, and the Ministry of Education will send a letter to foreign embassies and the China-America Association to assist students in enrollment. (3) Reduce the exchange rate. The Ministry of Finance replied that it had no authority to handle it and could request it from the Four Joint Offices. However, depending on the education policy, it will consult with the Ministry of Education and ask the Executive Yuan to change the difference between 3350 and 2020 into a study abroad subsidy. (4) Retain the original service unit's salary. The Ministry of Education replied that there was no precedent for this and it would be inconvenient to handle. The Executive Yuan said that the above requests would be answered after the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education jointly signed and considered them. The association believes that the results of the three representatives' trip to Beijing to petition have not been satisfactorily answered, and they will continue to appeal to all parties in order to achieve their goals and enable them to study abroad. The association also listed that the total value of imported goods from January to September of this year published by the Customs reached 997,587,169,000 national currency, which is converted into US dollars at an average of 2020 exchange rate of 493,855,000 US dollars. Compared with the total cost of 9,728,000 US dollars for the three-year study abroad expenses of the 1,216 self-funded students in this session, it is only 0.5%. The government should not begrudge this small amount of foreign exchange and hinder the path of aspiring students. The association has set up registration offices at No. 80 Aitang Road and No. 86 Tongfu Road to facilitate the registration of self-funded students from other places who come to Shanghai to join the association.</p>

<h3>University Football League Opens; Shanghai University vs. Fudan; 2:30 PM at Jiaotong University Stadium; Both Armies Preparing for Battle</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The first football league of colleges and universities in this city is scheduled to open at 2:30 PM today at the Xujiahui Jiaotong University Stadium. Shanghai University and Fudan University will face off first. The referee is Chen Ling. If it rains, the football group will notify to stop the game. This is the first university football match in this city after the victory. The grand occasion of the East China Eight Universities Jiangnan University football match will be seen again today. There will also be cheerleaders cheering. There will be a grand occasion on Xuhui Road again. The lineups of both sides are recorded below:</p>
<p>Fudan:</p>
<p>Zhang Zhirong Zhou Tianrong</p>
<p>Liu Kaiguo Lin Liangqing Wang Hesheng</p>
<p>Huang Gangwei (Captain) Qian Changrong Qu Lin</p>
<p>Shen Sijie Huang Keou Xiang Ba Wang Dingqiu Ren Jiagui Qian Jiaju</p>
<p>Shanghai University:</p>
<p>Zhao Yaozhang Zhang Fuqi</p>
<p>Cao Xinshu Chen Gongyao Zhang Bingxin</p>
<p>Huang Tingfang Xia Haifen Yu Hongchang Chen Baogen Yao Longxiang</p>
<p>Tu Biyi Yang Yongfang Wu Jingjiang (Captain) Zheng Deyao Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>Shanghai University Front Line Fierce</p>
<p>The Shanghai University football team has already been selected and practices every day. They also discussed tactics yesterday afternoon. Zheng Deyao, the captain of the team, and Wu Jingren, the center forward, are veteran football players of the school and have a tacit understanding with the left wing Tu Biyi, advancing and retreating properly. The center defender Yu Hongchang is good at using his head, and the center forward Wu Jingren passes the ball to both sides. The left wing's flying legs Tu Biyi sweep it in front of the goal, which is especially clever. Then the hard-footed Zheng Deyao accurately shoots the ball. Even if it does not hit the goal, it is not far away. The team's defense is weaker, but the Zheng and Yu players can be transferred to respond to unexpected situations. The school has organized a 60-person cheerleading squad, which will cheer and shout at the time. Cheng Shide, the head of the school's general affairs office, is the commander-in-chief, and the morale of the entire army is extremely high, which will pose a major threat to Fudan.</p>
<p>Fudan Offense and Defense Are Excellent</p>
<p>The Fudan football team has a fairly neat lineup. The captain Qian Changrong and the defender Wang Hesheng are both pillars of the Shanghai Football Association's A-League team, so the strength of the defense is far better than that of Shanghai University. Qian Jiaju, Qu Lin, and Shen Sijie are known as the three flying legs, coupled with the stability of the center forward Wang Dingqiu and the skillful ball handling of the two inside wings. I am afraid that Shanghai University, which has extremely high morale, will be busy coping. However, the team should try to avoid single-handedly dribbling straight, and always consider the gaps on both wings, then it will undoubtedly be able to win.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Fish Cup Small Football Final Today; Jianfeng vs. Yumenfa; Referee Team vs. Old Man Team Performance</h3>

<p>Referee - Old Man (Performance) 2:00 PM Shangshui Stadium</p>
<p>Jianfeng - Fish Team (Final) 3:00 PM Shangshui Stadium</p>

<p>Civil Affairs Briefs</p>
<h3>Ministry of Interior Explains "Household Registration" Terminology - Municipal Government Has Already Issued Instructions to All District Offices</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government approved a telegram from the Ministry of Interior, roughly stating: "The term 'household registration' in the current Household Registration Law refers to various registrations of 'nationality,' 'identity,' 'migration,' and 'floating population,' as well as registrations of 'changes,' 'corrections,' and 'cancellations.' However, in official documents from various departments, it is often mistakenly assumed that 'household registration' specifically refers to 'nationality registration,' or the terms 'household personnel registration' and 'change registration' are still used, leading to inconsistent terminology and misunderstandings. In the future, all departments should follow the regulations. When referring to all registrations, it should be called 'household registration.' When referring to a specific item, it should be separately called 'nationality registration,' 'identity registration,' 'migration registration,' 'floating population registration,' or 'establishment of household registration,' 'cancellation of household registration,' 'birth registration,' etc. After the first registration is completed, the continued handling of various registrations of 'nationality,' 'identity,' etc., should be called 'continued handling' or 'continued registration,' avoiding the use of the term 'change registration' to avoid confusion. Please investigate and instruct subordinates to take note." It is reported that the Municipal Government is instructing the police bureau and all district offices to take note.</p>
<h3>District Briefs</h3>
<p>The District Office of the 21st District (Xinshi) of this city stipulates that each Bao and Bao Ding must go to the district to sign in once every three days, with ten times per month as the standard, and will be assessed separately at the end of each month.</p>
<p>The Fifth Bao of the Fourth District (Penglai) intends to create a 17th Jia for the Fifth Bao, as the number of newly built shantytowns within the jurisdiction of the 8th and 9th Jia of the Bao is increasing, and the number of households in the existing Jia is also too large. Jin Lizhong was selected to serve as the Jia Head of the Jia.</p>
<p>Zhang Xingliang, the Jia Head of the 28th Jia of the 40th Bao of the Third District (Yimiao), has requested to resign. It is proposed to appoint Zhang Yimin to fill the vacancy, and the district has submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<p>The Cooperative of the Fifth District (Taishan) recently purchased a large number of towels and soaps and will soon begin distributing them to members.</p>

<h3>The Extravagant Feast at the Waldorf - A Sea of Tailcoats Everywhere - Diplomatic News - Skillful Use - Seemingly a Speaking Competition</h3>
<p>— November 20th, New York Air Mail - Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing, from New York</p>
<p>The early winter rains in Paris hastened the departure of the lively scene from the Luxembourg Palace. The Queen Elizabeth liner, which made its maiden voyage after the war, transported these figures who manipulate the fate of the world to this side of the Atlantic. The Waldorf Hotel next to New York's Park Avenue, which was not valued in the past, inherited the mantle of the Luxembourg Palace and became the center of world peace.</p>
<p>The flags of four countries are planted at the entrance of the Waldorf. The hotel is crowded with 'miscellaneous' travelers. The American official security work is done very discreetly. At the elevator entrance and in the bar, there are no 'Marines' standing full of guns and swords like at the United Nations venue. The Foreign Ministers' meeting itself is a 'closed-door' meeting, and the protection of these 'VIPs' by the secret police is mostly behind the scenes.</p>
<h3>Striving for Freedom of the Press - Protesting</h3>
<p>The meeting is set in a reception room on the seventh floor. Except for the opening day, when reporters were allowed to take photos, they were never allowed to enter again. The four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union each booked one or two rooms on the fifth floor as press rooms. Every day after the meeting, the press commissioners of the four countries reported on the day's meeting, and sometimes they could add a little description. For example, how Molotov lit a cigar, Bevin blushed during a certain speech, etc. Their reports were only limited to what was 'publishable,' which was of course discounted from the original. The American press commissioner initially prohibited reporters from non-American newspapers and news agencies from listening in. The British and French newspapers always maintained the principle of 'freedom of the press.'</p>
<p>Of course, many people expressed disappointment with the American approach. Some people protested to the State Department, and I was one of the first to protest. 'Public anger is hard to resist,' and it was eventually opened up.</p>
<h3>Everyone Wears Formal Attire - No Exceptions</h3>
<p>Newspaper reporters are now not only 'honored guests' at the 'Waldorf,' but also once served as 'good hosts.' That was on the evening of the first European Armistice Day (November 11th), when the New York Press Association publicly banqueted the chief representatives of the five permanent members of the United Nations and the representatives of the Security Council. The Press Association notified its members two weeks in advance. The public banquet fee was stipulated to be US$10. Each member could bring family members, adding US$10 in total. Those who brought more than two guests had to pay an additional US$15 per person, and it was stated: "There are not many seats, so please reserve quickly." The notice also solemnly wrote: "This association has specially invited: Bevin, Gu Weijun, Bernas, Perotty (French Vice Minister), and United Nations General Assembly President Spaak (Belgium) to speak." Molotov only agreed to attend on the day of the public banquet, so a sentence was temporarily added to the program: "This association is deeply honored that His Excellency Molotov will also attend and speak."</p>
<p>Two days before the public banquet, I received another notice from the Press Association: 'Everyone should wear formal attire to the banquet.' This was a first for me. When I was in London, I also attended Prime Minister Attlee's banquet, and newspaper reporters did not wear formal attire. A colleague from the New York Times was very angry and cursed those 'guys' from the Press Association for being boring. He said, "It's not a funeral. We newspaper reporters can't stand this!"</p>
<h3>Restaurant Converted into a Dance Hall - Bevin Reminisces</h3>
<p>However, the reporter gentlemen still obeyed the law. Under the silver lights, more than 500 people were all dressed in 'evening dress,' and the scene was very neat. Molotov, wearing luxurious formal attire, arrived earliest and shook hands with the reporters. Burns, Burns' wife, a typical noble old lady from the American South, was surrounded by 'hosts' asking questions. Foreign Minister Bevin arrived the latest. As soon as he saw the newspaper reporters, he spoke eloquently about his feelings. He said, "As soon as I entered the Waldorf Hotel, I thought of my childhood. Thirty-one years ago, at that time, I was younger than you are now, and I lived in this hotel." When walking from the reception hall on the third floor to the large restaurant on the 18th floor, Bevin couldn't help but exclaim: "I remember very clearly that I danced in this restaurant!"</p>
<p>He asked the person next to him: "This is a dance hall, why was it changed into a restaurant?" An American newspaper reporter told him: "Yes, it is still a dance hall. Today, because there are many people, tables have been temporarily arranged." Foreign Minister Bevin showed a naive smile. He believed that his memory was not bad!</p>
<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Guo Taiqi Appear at the Meeting</h3>
<p>Our representative Guo Taiqi and his wife arrived very early. Mrs. Guo was wearing a Chinese cheongsam and shook hands sincerely with many American female reporters. Mrs. Gu Weijun did not attend the event due to a 'cold.' Ambassador Gu's demeanor was very appropriate and considerate. An American woman in her forties shook hands with Ambassador Gu to greet him. He only said two or three words of greeting. Afterwards, someone told Gu that she was a famous reporter from the New York Herald Tribune. Ambassador Gu seemed to take the opportunity to greet her and talked very sincerely for several minutes. The next day, the New York Times published the full text of the speeches of the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and lightly passed over the opinions of China and France in one sentence. The Herald Tribune had a more detailed record of Ambassador Gu's speech.</p>
<h3>New Posture in Diplomatic Circles - Speech Competition</h3>
<p>Diplomatic skills are not simple, and the cooperation between diplomacy and news depends on good use. In front of fifty round tables and five hundred reporters, that day was actually a speech competition, although it was called a "public banquet." Inexperienced diplomats may 'faint' under the gaze of so many 'uncrowned kings.' The French 'Vice Minister,' although he did not attend, was already flustered enough. Spaak of Belgium, although he was not a representative of the country, showed everywhere that he was a 'veteran' among diplomats. His burly figure, clear and refreshing accent, humorous and relaxed content, and attitude of neither arrogance nor inferiority won warm applause. He spoke in French. Reporters who understood French laughed and cheered long ago. Those who did not understand French couldn't help but 'hold their stomachs' and exclaimed after it was translated into English.</p>
<h3>Bevin's Voice is Loud and Clear - Speaks with Great Weight</h3>
<p>Bevin mentioned the relationship with newspaper reporters at the beginning. He said that he was the chairman of a London newspaper: the Daily Herald (note: the organ of the British Labour Party). He also said that he had been to the Waldorf thirty-one years ago, but the scene at that time was completely different from today. Then he talked about Britain's contribution to world peace. His voice was loud and clear, and every sentence had weight, like a politician's speech. Molotov still spoke in Russian. He began by saying: Today's speakers all speak in English or French. "Because my language talent is too poor, I have no choice but to use Russian." Then he returned to the topic. Americans all paid attention to this second figure of the red empire with curiosity and mystery.</p>
<h3>Bernas Speaks About the American Spirit - Fighting to Defend Justice, Righteousness, and Peace</h3>
<p>Among the dozens of speeches I have heard Bernas give, none has been more successful than this one. Bernas always had a hoarse voice in his previous speeches, but this time it was clear and sweet. He was always 'too nervous' in the past, but this time he was 'calm and composed.' Not only were his tone and posture good, but the content was also good. First, Bernas is the mainstay of the current Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party completely failed in the congressional election. Many people are concerned about Bernas's future and the future of American foreign policy. Bernas gave an answer in his speech. Second, the Press Association publicly banqueted the chief representatives of the United Nations. The chief representative of the United States was not him, but Mr. Austin. He spoke very carefully in his speech. He emphasized the feelings of the first European Armistice Day and said that countless American athletes had "died on the battlefield" and bravely died twice in battle, and then said that the United States was determined to defend justice, righteousness, and world peace.</p>

<h3>Finally Reciting - A Letter from an American Mother</h3>
<p>Every sentence of his was written in a literary style. Especially when he finally recited a 'Letter from an American Mother,' I saw many colleagues moved, and a few people had tears rolling in their eyes.</p>
<p>That letter was written by an American mother from Minnesota to an American bishop. The mother's son died in the Battle of Okinawa. The mother described how her son bravely joined the army and bravely died on the battlefield for a noble ideal of mankind. She described the last meeting with her child and the moment of farewell when the child left. Every sentence and every word was full of passion and tears.</p>
<p>Bernas's speech ended with this letter, adding a lot of aftertaste to many people.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Talks About Asia - Looking Forward to a New Life</h3>
<p>Ambassador Gu Weijun was the second speaker (the first was Spaak). His clear English won a lot of appreciation from the audience. That day, Ambassador Gu especially emphasized the "new life" of Asia and the Far East. And these "new lives" were all inspired by China. The content was powerful and insightful. It is said that the speech was written by Principal Yang Yongqing and revised by Ambassador Gu. The next day, the New York Times wrote in the news column: "Dr. Gu Weijun's speech last night looked forward to a new Asia!" (At the New York Times Building)</p>
<h3>A New Experiment by the British Labour Party: Socialist Economic Policies in Progress</h3>
<p>— London Airmail, November 21st, by our Correspondent in Britain, Zhu Zunzhi</p>
<p>Recently, the British Parliament reconvened, and the Labour government announced its policy guidelines for this parliamentary term. At that time, fifty-eight Labour MPs put forward an amendment criticizing Foreign Secretary Bevin's foreign policy as leaning to the right and being out of sync with the Labour Party's socialist policies. Since the Labour Party came to power, British domestic policy has been entirely on the socialist path. But what differentiates it from the past? What is the difference between so-called socialist economics and Soviet communism? These questions seem to have received little attention, and the British people seem indifferent.</p>
<p>A Major Blow to the Soviets, Also Greatly Influences the US</p>
<p>A common feature of British socialism and Soviet communist economic policies is planned economy, with "control" and "nationalization" visible everywhere. However, the biggest difference between the two is that the British Labour Party does not neglect individual freedom. Its goal is to have socialism and democracy go hand in hand. So-called socialism is not only an economic model, but also does not oppose the spirit of democracy in politics. If this system succeeds, it should be the most ideal political and economic system after the fall of capitalism, completely different from the Soviet economic system that disregards individual freedom. This may be the most envious point of the Soviet Union towards Britain, because although the Soviet Union has always opposed capitalism, its own system has too many shortcomings. The British Labour Party's approach can not only avoid the various drawbacks of the capitalist economy, but also, under the premise of maintaining the spirit of democracy, can diagnose and treat the socio-economic problems proposed by Marx and embark on the path of economic equality. The British Labour Party's economic policy is still in the experimental stage. Once it achieves success, it will naturally be a huge blow to the Soviet Union's "ideal," and it will also have a very profound impact on American capitalism, both superficially and substantially. The American labor organization is powerful. If there are signs of shaking in the American economic structure, the American labor organization is likely to follow the example of Britain and establish an American Labour Party. Such a third party, with the British precedent, is very likely to overthrow the Democratic and Republican parties and then enter the White House.</p>
<p>Five Years of Foundations Laid, the Conservative Party is Powerless to Deal With It</p>
<p>The biggest thing the British Labour Party has done in more than a year in power is to "nationalize" or "state-own" all important economic institutions, such as railways, highways, aviation, shipping, telecommunications, banks, and important industrial raw materials such as steel, iron, and coal mines. Currently, what has already been nationalized through Parliament includes the Bank of England and the national coal mines. What needs to be discussed after the opening of this parliament are transportation and the electrical industry. Also in the planning are the steel industry and the textile industry. British society, which has lived under a free economy for a long time, is of course not easy to adapt to this economic system where everything is state-owned, but after the Labour Party has decided on this policy, all proposals are easily passed in the parliament where the Labour Party has a majority. The reason why general voters elected the Labour Party in the British general election last July was mostly because they were tired of the Conservative Party and wanted to change the situation. Few people thought that if the Labour Party won in this election, it would be the beginning of a contest between British capitalism and socialism.</p>
<p>Labour Party Socialism is under a century-long plan, and five years is of course a very short time, making it difficult to achieve victory again in the next general election. Therefore, some people doubt whether we will still see the Conservative Party making a comeback in our lifetime.</p>
<p>The Nest of British Capitalism, Changing the System Is Not Easy</p>
<p>The Labour Party is naturally successful in promoting everything under these favorable conditions, but conservative British capitalists are sometimes unusually stubborn. For example, the nationalization of the steel industry cannot be carried out for the time being, because large capitalists have a lot of equity in steel, and the complexity of the problem is far greater than that of the coal mining industry. The fact that there is no case of steel industry nationalization on the parliamentary agenda is also a harbinger of the Labour Party's surrender to the Conservative Party. In fact, this kind of criticism is inevitably excessive. The change of the entire national economic system cannot be accomplished in one or two years, let alone the fact that Britain is the nest of capitalism! Recently, the British Fabian Society held its 50th anniversary celebration, and the Labour government gave it quite a boost, resulting in some ridicule. The Fabian Society is the pioneer of British socialism, but on the point of nationalization, it advocates starting with education rather than advocating radicalism. Therefore, the so-called progressive leftists ridiculed the government, believing that the government's nationalization policy was originally contrary to the Fabian Society's approach. Now, the government does not dare to take active policies for a while, but uses the Fabian Society to cover up its own incompetence!</p>
<p>Labour Party Social Insurance System, Established Very Well</p>
<p>The British social insurance system is the most perfect in the world, and the Labour Party has worked harder on social insurance since it came to power. The relevant bills passed by the parliament in the past year include the "National Insurance Act," the "Industrial Injury Insurance Act," and the "National Health Act," etc. In addition to the various facilities of social insurance in the past, now British people, whether it is childbirth, death, old age, disability, unemployment, retirement... all insurance is handled by the government. The risk of freezing and starvation can almost be said to have been reduced to a minimum. The so-called "from cradle to grave" insurance system has been very well established. This year, the government's expenditure on social insurance is a total of 450 million pounds, which will increase to 600 million pounds in 1948, accounting for 10% of national income. The British population is only 45 million to 48 million, so this amount is quite large. Britain is currently not far from the level of full employment. Even if male and female soldiers in the transition period are included, the number of unemployed people is less than 7% of the total population. This number can be reduced to 2% in the short term.</p>
<p>Increase in Export Trade, Headaches About Housing, Clothing and Food</p>
<p>As for British export trade, the Labour Party has adopted the traditional and consistent policy of increasing production and increasing exports, because the British Isles live by overseas trade, and without business, there is nothing. After the war, the goal of British export trade was to increase to 175% of that in 1938. As of the end of September this year, it had reached 104%. The biggest difficulty in Britain's economic recovery is the lack of power and raw materials, and the lack of coal is the fatal wound to Britain's foreign trade.</p>
<p>Housing, clothing, and food rationing are the two most troublesome issues for the government in post-war Britain. These two issues are directly related to people's daily lives. The people's reaction to the government's actions on clothing, food, and housing is fast, so it has become a psychological problem. In fact, these are all superficial difficulties, and they are problems that any post-war country will have.</p>
<p>Current Achievements Are Already Gratifying, and Future Fruits Will Be Greater</p>
<p>Democratic politics and a socialist economic system progressing simultaneously is a new experiment. In the world after World War II, only the British Labour Party government is carrying it out boldly, regardless of all difficulties, and Labour Party members are of course proud of it. However, in the international arena, although the Labour Party has its ideals, the steps it has taken are very cautious, because reality should not be ignored in international politics. Some Labour Party members do not seem to understand this very well, and thus the so-called "rebellion case" has occurred. The growth of a system is different from magic, and it takes time. The Labour Party's current achievements are already gratifying and commendable. When the socialist experiment inside Britain blooms and bears fruit in the future, its impact on the international arena will not be predictable by ordinary progressive internationalists.</p>
<h3>On the Subei Canal Line</h3>
<p>— Zhenjiang, 2nd, by Pan Shenzhi</p>
<p>Gaoyou, Baoying, Huaian, and Huaiyin counties along the Subei Canal line were rich in civilian goods and resources before the war. During the War of Resistance, they suffered the ravages of the enemy and puppets. Since the victory, they have been occupied by the Communist army. Today, the houses are dilapidated, epidemics are rampant, floods are frequent, and wailing is heard everywhere. It is unbearable to describe. The author went to Huai for business and happened to meet Zheng Tonghe, director of the Suning Branch of the Executive Yuan, and Deputy Director Li Chongde, who went to inspect these places. I will record what I saw and heard to report the truth:</p>
<p>Disease and Flood</p>
<p>The percentage of houses destroyed in urban and rural areas of Gaoyou, Baoying, Huaian, and Huaiyin counties is 10% to 20%. Shaobo Town in Jiangdu has suffered more damage. Schools, hospitals, and public places in each county are mostly damaged. People's property losses are very heavy, and life is extremely difficult, especially in Huaiyin. On the west bank of the canal between Huaian and Huaiyin, the Communist army breached five openings. From Huaiyin to Baoying, the west bank of the river is a vast ocean, stretching for more than a hundred miles. In the western countryside of Gaoyou, floods have caused disaster, inundating a total of more than 2 million mu of land. There are 500,000 people in urgent need of relief, all lacking clothing and food and displaced, in a very miserable state. In the Huaian, Huaiyin, Lianshui, and Siyang areas, about 200,000 people suffer from kala-azar, and 20,000 people suffer from yaws, which are spreading rapidly and urgently need treatment. Most of the grain in each county was looted by the Communist army. According to local sources, the remaining grain is only enough for consumption this winter, and a grain shortage is inevitable in the spring. It is now the winter plowing season. Although some areas have already been sown, returning refugees and poor farmers still lack wheat seeds and plowing cattle and cannot sow. In the west bank of the river, the flood has not receded, and winter plowing is almost hopeless.</p>
<p>Dangerous Canal Banks</p>
<p>The Yellow River breach has not been blocked, and the Yellow River water and the Huai River water converge and flow from Hongze Lake through the Sanhe Dam into the Guangying, Gaoyou, and Shaobo lakes and reach the canal. The water is surging and has not receded. In previous years, the water level of the canal in winter was only about 11 to 12 feet, but now it is still above 15 feet. Between Shaobo and Gaobao, the canal and the lakes rely only on a line of western bank as a barrier. If the west bank is not protected, the lake water will pour out, and the east bank of the canal will be in danger of collapsing. If the east bank collapses, hundreds of miles of land from Lianghuai in the north to Shaobo in the south and to the Lixia River area in the east will become a swamp. Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Baoying will bear the brunt and suffer the most. Its danger is even greater than the seawall in southern Jiangsu. The east bank of the canal, from Shaobo to Huaiyin, is more than 150 kilometers long and is also the main line of the Yangqing Highway. The bank has been in disrepair for many years. There are already several dangerous sections in the Shaobo to Gaobao section. The bank outside the south gate of Gaoyou has also been seeping water. If it is not repaired in time, the danger can be predicted during the summer flooding season next year.</p>
<p>Director Zheng's Inspection</p>
<p>After the recovery of Huaiyin and Huaian, the Suning Branch of the Executive Yuan immediately sent personnel to Huaian to set up an office and transferred flour and old clothes from Xuzhou to be distributed selectively in the areas of Huaian, Huaiyin, Siyang, and Suqian that were severely affected by the disaster. When canal navigation was restored, another 300 tons of flour were transported by water from Zhenjiang to Huai for emergency relief. 150 tons of flour have also been allocated from the Gaobao area, and personnel have been sent to investigate and release it. The first phase of emergency relief has been completed. The branch's relief effort was rapid and simple, which was well received by the local community. The author witnessed the branch's investigators still working hard in the dim twilight in Gaoyou. In terms of epidemic prevention, the branch has invited Mr. Lawson, a foreign expert from UNRRA, and Miss Adam to Huai to organize a temporary epidemic prevention team and, together with the Jiangsu Provincial Health Department, sent staff to treat kala-azar and yaws. Prevention and treatment began on the 11th of last month in the Siyang and Huaiyin areas.</p>
<p>Zheng Tonghe, director of the Suning Branch, and Li Chongde, deputy director, departed from Zhenjiang on the 6th of last month to inspect the disaster-stricken areas, health institutions, elementary school buildings, warehouse management, and embankment projects in each county. After the inspection, Zheng decided: (1) to rush a large amount of flour and old clothes from Zhenjiang to the counties along the canal to provide emergency relief to disaster victims, and to telegraph the headquarters to allocate an additional 1,000 tons of relief flour to the Huai area to continue the second phase of emergency relief; (2) to discuss with the Canal Engineering Bureau the emergency repair of dangerous parts of the embankment, widen the bank, and plan to build concrete block stone projects at the dangerous sections. The five breaches between Huaian and Huaiyin have been temporarily closed, but the project is crude and may not last. A discussion with the Engineering Bureau was also conducted to reinforce and repair them; (3) to use work as relief to repair the health centers in the four counties of Huaihuai, Gaobao, and to allocate hospital beds and medical equipment. In Huaiyin, more than 230 boxes of medicines and equipment have been transported and are being distributed; (4) to assist the counties along the canal in repairing 20 elementary school buildings that have been destroyed; (5) to allocate 500 tons of flour to exchange for wheat seeds and distribute them to returning refugees and the poor for winter plowing; (6) to do our best to send refugees back to their hometowns so that they can live in peace and make a living.</p>
<p>In summary, the disaster area along the canal in northern Jiangsu is vast, the disaster is serious, and there are many disaster victims. Although the Suning Branch has organized emergency relief and work relief, it is only a temporary measure. It is hoped that government authorities and people from all walks of life will strive to fundamentally eliminate the disaster so that the people of northern Jiangsu can escape the water and fire and ascend to a comfortable life as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>On the Translation of Musical Terms: The Transliteration of Four Composers' Names</h3>
<p>— Li Chi</p>
<p>Here, I would like to specifically mention several composers' names mentioned by Mr. Zhu et al. as examples of my previous article.</p>
<p>1.  The Transliteration of Dvořák</p>
<p>First, let me state my opinion: I agree with Mr. Joseph Zhang and Mr. Ning's assertion that the initial "D" should not be dropped or untranslated. However, since Mr. Zhu transliterates it as "Fu Xia Ke," the consonant at the beginning of the second syllable is clearly much closer to being translated as "l." Here, let me digress a bit:</p>
<p>One or two years before the Pacific War, in short, it was D.'s "anniversary," I stayed in Hong Kong and happened to be proofreading a concert program for a friend, so I ran into a first-class English printing house. A foreigner was also proofreading "clean copies" next to me, but he had a lot of typos. I was surprised; "clean copies" rarely had typos in the past. I stretched my neck and took a look. I first saw that it was not English, nor French, German, Russian, Italian, or Spanish. Looking closely, I found many Dvorak words. I curiously asked him: "Is that Czech?" The foreigner seemed a little annoyed and only said: "How can you say that the text is Czech?" A moment later, he said to himself: "All the hats are not worn!" I understood that he was saying that the symbols above the two letters in D.'s name were not typeset, which made him angry. From this, I believe that Mr. Zhang and Mr. Ning are right that the diaeresis on the "r" and the accent mark on the "a" are indeed indispensable.</p>
<p>Then, I learned from the printing house that the "Free Czech Association" staying in Hong Kong was preparing to hold a commemorative concert on the evening of D.'s "anniversary." I did not give up the opportunity, and that night I unexpectedly heard a surprisingly rich program of all D.'s works. Someone gave a speech at the meeting. Judging from common sense, he was very likely D.'s "fellow countryman." I heard very clearly that he mentioned D.'s name several times, pronouncing the initial "D" very heavily, without dropping it.</p>
<p>Then, what is the pronunciation of the consonant in the second syllable, the "r" with a "hat"? In my memory, it is not the English "rolled r," but the "fricative" or "burst-fricative with plosive" between the tip of the tongue and the upper palate. It is slightly similar to but actually different from English sh, zh, tsh, dzh. Later, I finally found its "phonetic value" in a phonetics book written by a Japanese, but unfortunately the book is not at hand, and I dare not say it randomly now, but I remember that there are no ready-made and appropriate relative phonetic values in Japanese, English, and Chinese. Based on the results I heard above, I dare not use it as the criterion for the final decision.</p>
<p>(2) Schubert and Mozart</p>
<p>I would also like to put forward the transliteration of the names of Schubert and Mozart mentioned by Mr. Zhu to serve as examples of "language changing with emotion."</p>
<p>I remember that not long after Japan and Nazi Germany formed an alliance, Hitler sent Mr. Kempf to Tokyo as a "music festival envoy." Objectively speaking, Mr. K.'s "bloodline" and musical cultivation can be considered unquestionable. I have heard his performances and lectures. When he read the manuscript in front of the microphone with a standard accent, he pronounced the "t" at the end of each of the two names S and M very clearly. Moreover, the second consonant from the end of S's name, "r," was also unexpectedly emphasized. At that time, I believed that some people in Germany also read it like this. Mr. Kai translated it as "Schubert" without dropping the "er" sound.</p>
<p>Also in those one or two years, I watched two sound films with S.'s biography as the subject, one German film and one French film. In these two films, I heard many pronunciations of his name very clearly. The simplest is to pronounce the syllable "—bert" at the end as (—bet), that is, the most ambiguous "e" in the center of the tongue, and the "t" below is so weak that it is almost inaudible. This is almost the same as the pronunciation we usually hear when foreigners casually talk. However, there was a scene in the film where S. was so poor that he pawned his beloved instrument. After he left, the old clerk called his name loudly, and the "r" and "t" at the end of his name were pronounced very clearly.</p>
<p>These two examples may help us whether we can accept Mr. Zhu's proposal to translate it as "Mo Zha" and omit the "r" and "t" at the end. I think that even if someone omits it in conversation (the tongue trying every possible way to be lazy is also one of the phonetic phenomena), but since the standard and emphatic pronunciation is still preserved, then the Chinese transliteration should adopt the latter.</p>
<p>However, according to what I have heard people pronounce S's or M's name, no matter how simplified it is, it will not be like Mr. Zhu said that only a "Y" rhyme is left at the very end of M's name, and it becomes a so-called "open rhyme" without a consonant. Some people pronounce M's name as (rnotzart) or (rnouzart). A simpler way is to shorten the "rhyme" at the end to (—aat) or (—at) or even (—atr). As for saying (—a) without a consonant ending, it is the first time I have heard it from Mr. Zhu. It is worth noting that (—atr) means that after the mouth finishes saying (—a—), the tip of the tongue pushes up to the front teeth behind to complete the preparation for making the consonant "t," but at this time, all the vocal organs are completely relaxed, the vocal cords stop vibrating, there is no aspiration, no burst, and the tip of the tongue is also lowered. There is no such "stoppage" with a consonant in Beijing language. As far as I know, the "entering tone" characters in Cantonese often have this (—ati), such as the Cantonese pronunciation of "cha" in "friction." Mr. Zhu thinks that it is correct to translate M's name as "Mo Zha" in the northern language. I am afraid that the root lies here. However, this kind of slight reading is clearly not enough for transliteration. Furthermore, when calling someone's name orally, how can you save only one or two consonants? It is said that in the meeting of the three giants, Roosevelt initially called "Joseph Stalin" in full. Later, when they became familiar, it was only shortened to one syllable "Joe," which is quite like us calling "Old Li" or "Old Zhu." I think that if someone named "Mo" and named "Cha (Zha) Te" was born in China, his friends would undoubtedly call him "Old Mo." But when signing the treaty, it is still "Joseph Stalin"; when applying for an ID card and registering, it is still said "Mo Cha (Zha) Te"!</p>
<p>It is a fact that foreigners' pronunciation of people's names cannot be as uniform as in the dictionary. Also, the "spelling" of foreigners writing the names of foreigners from that country is not completely uniform. There are four or five different ways to write the name of Russian "Tchaikovsky" in German and English. If the writing is different, the chance of pronunciation differences is naturally greater. The Chinese transliteration of "Gorky" is wrong, and the British should bear half the responsibility.</p>
<p>3.  The Transliteration of Beethoven</p>
<p>The transliteration of B's name can be used as a concrete example of the "original sound" issue mentioned in the fifth paragraph above. B can be said to be one of the most familiar to people in China, but the transliteration of the name is also the most uneven.</p>
<p>I have found in books that there are at least two ways to read his name. One is that the British and Americans are accustomed to reading "th" as a "t" or the dental tip sound "th," and transliterations such as "Bei Duo Fen" and "Bei Duo Wen" come from this. However, the Germans more commonly put the "t" in the first syllable, leaving only the soft palate guttural sound "h" in the second syllable. Mr. Wang Guangqi, who first introduced B's name to China more than 20 years ago and eventually died in front of the Berlin Library, translated it as "Bai Di Huo Fen." These four Chinese characters may be a bit ugly, but "sound for sound," Mr. Wang's transliteration represents many Germanic people, that is, the second reading.</p>
<p>4.  Final "Redundant Words"</p>
<p>It can be roughly seen from the above how difficult the compilation of the transliteration of people's names is, but this is only four people. If you squeeze many people's names together again, there is naturally a more basic question: Is our ideal to try to find the most accurate one individually, or to first consider the minimum but average accuracy of the whole, and would rather sacrifice the most accurate one individually?</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to put forward a few "redundant words": In the above, I have not yet considered the "voiceless" and "voiced" of all consonants, such as p and b, t and d, etc., and how to match "ㄅ" and "ㄆ", "ㄊ" and "ㄉ" in Beijing language. Because this principle is not only limited to the transliteration of music terms.</p>
<h3>Bullfighting</h3>

<p>Guo Ya (Goya 1746-1828) was an outstanding talent in 18th century Spain. He had a great influence on 19th century French painting. His style is bold and profound. He especially likes to paint bullfighting. This work can be called a representative work. (Lion)</p>
<h3>Fire</h3>
<p>— Written by Su. Korolenko, Translated by Li Qiliu</p>
<p>How long it is! The dark autumn night. Suddenly I felt that I was floating on the sinister river of shadow. At this time, in the deep part of the river, on my rhyme surface, there was a shining fire.</p>
<p>It shone brilliantly and powerfully, very close to me………</p>
<p>"Ah! Thank God—I said happily—tonight's lodging has arrived………".</p>
<p>I shook the oars and looked at the fire again, but pressed the oars down forcefully again.</p>
<p>"Still far away!"</p>
<p>I did not examine how the fire was shining; it was appearing on the extremely dark side. The oars have been picked up, obviously, the journey is still far away!</p>
<p>This night fire, how bright, overcoming the darkness—is slowly approaching, shining, greeting its relatives. It seems that there are only two or three oars away—to reach the destination. But, the distance in between—is far away!</p>
<p>The river is like ink, endless darkness, I still floated on this dark river for a long time. Canyons and cliffs stand on both banks of the river. Behind, what is left and lost seems to be endless prospects. But, the fire is shining completely in front—it is so close and so far………</p>
<p>Now I recall the dark river shaded by canyons and cliffs, and the living fire. In the past, in the future, the relatives who are called are not just me. However, the warmth of life needs to pass through the shadowy river bank, but, the fire is still far away. It is time to shake the oars again…………</p>
<p>In the end, in the end, it is in front—fire.</p>
<h3>Bismarck's Love Letters</h3>
<p>— Tian Xing</p>
<p>German Chancellor Bismarck, the advocate of "blood and iron," was an outstanding figure of modern times. In the Esperanto publication "La Verda Revuo," I came across a love letter he wrote to Miss von Puttkamer, filled with such tender affection that it read like a beautiful prose poem. I have translated it specifically for you. The love letter is divided into two sections, and the following is the main text:</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>I am waiting for the dawn to write to you, my sweet heart! You are like a small green alcohol lamp, bringing light and boiling my cold water. ... This morning, I have had a wonderful time; the most fitting thing to do is to write you a lovely letter. After completing these tasks, I have decided to spend this entire evening thinking of you; my beloved, to pass it in joyful and pleasant intimate conversation. As I write this letter, it is as if we are sitting on the sofa in that green reception room, and you are paying close attention to my wishes with great sympathy. This mail coach, for my pleasure, has brought me your letter just as I was free. ... How fortunate! You can never imagine how sad and painful my heart was when I returned from my travels and re-entered my house in the past, gloomy as if entering an ice cellar... Alas, God! And now? From my perspective, everything is different, because of you. My heart is always close to you, or rather, it belongs entirely to you. ... My life, viewed as a whole, is a new phenomenon. Now, even when doing defense matters and political work, I am happy and interested. This change, this new life, although due to God's grace, must be attributed to you, my admired and lovely Miss von Puttkamer—you, you have warmed my heart, not like the flickering flame of alcohol, but burning within me a warm, still fire. (February 1, 1847)</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Why is your letter so sad? In that letter, I can find no words that say you do not love me, nor can I imagine words that express more love for me. If it were not for me, perhaps you would be thinking of the future and creating a state of mind that oppresses you in some way, a state of mind that troubles and depresses you. Who is more willing than I to share your sorrows, bear your pain, and take responsibility for your mistakes? ... My dear Rongna, must I repeat it to you again? I love you dearly; needless to say, we should share both good fortune and misfortune—I will bear your sufferings, and you will bear mine; and we will each receive our share of comfort. You can pour out your heart to me whenever you wish, and I will give you mine; our hearts and blood will flow together. I should and want to bear your worries, your sorrows, and your regrets—if you have any—and love you as you love me—not in the way you should love me or can manage to love me. (February 21)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 115</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>About ten feet away from the entrance of the flower lattice gate, there were several brocade square cushions on the ground. Upon reaching this point, the two women following Tsurumi hurriedly bent over and rushed forward, then crawled on the ground again, extending their snow-white hands from their sleeves to tidy up the central brocade cushion. In reality, the cushions were already placed neatly; their tidying up was to signal to Tsurumi, "Your Excellency can stop here; this is your seat."</p>
<p>As soon as Tsurumi stopped, the two women, bending at the waist, moved as if rolling and crawling, rushing quickly towards the closing gate at the head. When they walked, their feet were always bent, and since they were moving quickly while bending over, the large bundle on their backs, though covered by a light gauze dress, was affected by the unbalanced walking posture, so you could only see the peak on their backs bobbing up and down, rising and falling, in a very unartistic manner.</p>
<p>Tsurumi had arrived before this once-powerful and influential minister, but since the two had not yet greeted each other, he could not squat down immediately; he had to stand there for the time being. He saw the two women, upon reaching within a step or two of the low bed, suddenly crawl onto the ground and kowtow repeatedly, murmuring in low voices, probably reporting Tsurumi's arrival. The man lying on the low bed, who had been motionless, feigning a "spring nap in a thatched cottage," stiffly frozen, seemed to start up like a robot after the two women recited their report. Though he still did not move, one could hear him first drawing a full breath from his dan tian, lifting it straight up, and pushing it to his nasal cavity with a "humph!" sound, as if someone had punched him hard in the chest, making that humming sound. Immediately afterward, his eyes still on the book and his body still motionless, he began to recite the book in a tone like that of an old Taoist priest performing a ritual, chanting "Hurry, hurry, as the law decrees!" The sound was high, in the proper court key:</p>
<p>"Hong kong jiao, shou ji jiao da jiao li? Kuan, jiao ti jiao, yi si lu gui jiao, fan jiao qin tuo tang qi, wa..."</p>
<p>As soon as his machine-like message started and he began to recite loudly, nothing else mattered; it was only poor Tsurumi standing stiffly on the spot. Although it was amusing to watch, it was also somewhat overwhelming, like the Shanghai dialect's "chi fei xiao" (can't take it). You must know that he hadn't rested properly for fifty or sixty hours; although Elder Aoki had helped him activate his latent spirit, how long could he maintain it like this? According to Tsurumi, who carefully noted the time, the man lay on the bed, maintaining that ancient posture without the slightest change, chanting "jiao ji jiao" for at least half an hour or more.</p>
<p>As for the two women crawling on the ground, they probably had some experience, so as soon as the man made a sound, knowing it would not end soon, they simply relaxed their limbs and lay lazily on the ground to rest, like snakes sunning themselves. The two geisha-like female musicians, however, did not relax; instead, they braced themselves and, like movie dubbers, coordinated with the high and low, fast and slow, rising and falling tones of the chanting, using their pipa and zither to accompany it. They raised their tones with the high parts, lowered them with the low parts, and added interjections, interludes, and fillers, creating atmosphere, etc., trying their best to make the chanting sound colorful and vivid.</p>
<p>This important Japanese figure, who at the time held the power to decide life and death for the entire nation, could also be said to have initiated the slaughter in this Eastern Hemisphere since launching the "Greater East Asia" war of aggression. And from his collusion with international demons, having established the "Seven Secret Weaves" in preparation for disrupting the world's public law and the existing order of human morality, this fellow can simply be said to be one of the evil stars destroying the entire world. At this late hour, facing Tsurumi, who held a small position (from this fellow's position, Tsurumi was just a small special agent), why was he putting on this set of neurotic "twelve o'clock" games?</p>

<h3>The Glass Merchant</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Amid the hawker turmoil, those who were beaten, injured, detained, suffered losses, attacked, or reprimanded are too numerous to mention. The mayor and reporters are all in a chaotic mess. Unexpectedly, this tense and confusing scene created an opportunity for glass merchants to make a fortune, truly "when a person is destined to get rich, even ghosts will lead the way"!</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, look at the facts:</p>
<p>First, according to Kwok Lam-sheung, manager of Wing On Company, speaking to reporters: After the disturbances, the price of glass in the city soared, doubling in the past two days.</p>
<p>Second, according to Tsai Chang, manager of Sincere Company: The 34 pieces of glass destroyed at the company were valued at 30 million yuan the day before yesterday (referring to the 2nd), according to an estimate from Tsai Heng Mao Glass Company, but yesterday (referring to the 3rd) the price had risen to 80 million yuan.</p>
<p>Doubling in two days, aside from selling human meat buns, there is nothing in the world more bloody and profitable than this.</p>
<p>Operating in the glass business naturally requires one to be shrewd. Opportunities like this for large-scale glass demand in Shanghai probably only happen once every ten years. If you don't take advantage of this price increase, are you afraid the money will burn your hands?</p>
<p>A friend jokingly said that under these circumstances, the thugs in the turmoil might be hired by the glass companies.</p>
<p>Another friend jokingly said that next time there is a similar event, I will definitely suggest to the thugs: Please specifically target glass companies and glass shops to show off your skills!</p>
<p>Mr. Mayor, what are your insightful views on this extraneous development of the hawker incident? Do you not think this is a form of irony? (I dare not say it is "profiteering from disaster.")</p>
<h3>The Capital Relocation Debate</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>A heated debate arose over "setting the capital" while discussing the "Constitution," with "Nanjing" and "Beiping" becoming the focal points of the dispute.</p>
<p>Those advocating for "setting the capital in Beiping" were representatives from North, Northwest, and Northeast China, but most representatives outside these northern regions opposed "relocating the capital to Beiping." Reflecting on the conclusion of this debate, it seems that everyone was somewhat close to "prejudice"? Both sides inevitably exhibited "proximity to the capital" and "exploiting local advantages," creating a suspicion of "selfish views"!</p>
<p>However, from a rational perspective, let us first analyze the principle of "relocating the capital to remedy the current decline" as advocated by the northern representatives. In light of the times, we feel it is not "the most pressing task"! To "remedy the decline"? We should first emphasize the exertion of "human power" as the vanguard. If we base the decision to relocate the capital on historical advantages in transportation, economy, culture, national defense, and geographical advantages, then we must understand that today's rapid scientific advancements can overcome everything! If one relies on the aforementioned advantages while "sticking to old ways," "holding positions without performing duties," and "not seeking improvement," then no matter how "complete" the relocated capital may be, it will be in vain.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the capital were to be relocated, expenses would naturally come first. Recalling the expenses of returning to the capital after the victory, how much money was spent? The complications in transportation and personnel caused great effort and lasted for months, all of which were felt to be extremely difficult! Not long ago, the past is like yesterday, and is the current national treasury "abundant" or "deficit"? In today's circumstances, where the rulers and the ruled are in distress and the people are suffering, where can we bear this heavy burden? There is no clumsier thing than "exhausting the people and wasting resources," "wasting time and abandoning work"!</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, under the current circumstances, relocating the capital would have "a hundred disadvantages and not a single advantage," truly a "superfluous act"! Instead, efforts should be focused on "construction," "spiritual unity," "utilizing talent to the fullest," and "utilizing the land to the fullest," which are the only conditions for "remedying the current decline"!</p>
<p>In the past, when Emperor Shun was a potter and general goods merchant, as long as he lived in a place for a year, that place could be transformed from barren land into a village; after living there for two years, the village would become as large as a prefecture; and after living there for three years, it would become a bustling commercial port. This was because Shun was able to "manage diligently." Therefore, from this perspective, we feel that the location of the capital should not be based on advantages as the main theme. Moreover, how can we be certain that the capital can be "remedied" after relocation? We dare not say for sure! Especially in an era of rapid scientific progress, "human effort can overcome nature," so why is it necessary to have this "Nanjing" and "Beiping" dispute?</p>
<p>"Clang!" It bumped into the toe of a friend beside me, but his toe saved it, only causing a little scratch on its forehead. Suddenly, I squatted down again to pick it up; I wanted it to rush towards destruction again.</p>
<p>But my friend blocked my hand, smiling as he told me, "The rice bowl itself is not at fault." As a result, it was saved again.</p>
<p>One day, one month, one year… it still accompanied me through life's journey, one stage after another. Time and frost had long etched cracks onto it, just as wrinkles had been added to my face. As I lamented my own life, I also thought, "It is also aging!"</p>
<p>My friend told me again, "Be careful, my friend, now just a slight tremor will destroy it."</p>
<p>"The rice bowl itself is not at fault" echoed in my mind. I began to feel attached to it.</p>
<p>"Clang," the sound gave me a shiver of foreboding.</p>
<p>I turned on the light to see that it had already fallen from the table to the ground, breaking into a not-so-complete lotus flower. It had found rest, eternal rest.</p>
<p>A "squeak" sound came from under the bed. Looking closely, I saw a mouse hiding in the wall hole, proudly laughing.</p>
<p>I bent down, picked up a piece from its remains, and examined it carefully. One or two grains of rice, still clinging to it from careless washing, were attached to it. "So it was these two grains of rice that attracted the mouse's covetous gaze," I suddenly realized?</p>
<p>Rice bowl and night, rice grains and mouse… a series of images swirled in my mind. I lay down on the bed, imagining a tomorrow without a rice bowl.</p>
<p>Grumblings</p>
<h3>Rice Bowl</h3>
<p>— Xue Zhen</p>
<p>Rice bowl, the companion of my life.</p>
<p>One day, I picked it up, clenched my fist, and wanted to smash it with my fist. Obviously, I already hated and even loathed it; but in the end, I didn't smash it. I realized that although it was hateful, it was still needed.</p>
<p>Another day, I picked it up trembling. I smiled menacingly, turned my head, and threw it away with all my might. I was determined to break away from it, even to destroy it.</p>

<h3>Identifying the Body</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>Please Point Out the Contradiction</p>
<p>"I know the body has been soaking in the water for several days. Right?" said Port Detective Lang Sheng. At this time, he was accompanying Professor Huo Danai in a car to the morgue, where they were preparing for someone to identify the body.</p>
<p>"We found him in a very calm ditch," Lang Sheng continued, "Ah, his death was terribly gruesome. He was lying face down in the ditch, the back of his head shattered, covered in blood. His clothes were very wet and had already faded in color, undoubtedly due to being submerged for a long time. And his face! Ah, he had been in the water for at least four days. Based on the description of his appearance, I can confirm that it is the Bai Dewan they are looking for, although I could not find any papers or business cards on him as evidence."</p>
<p>Professor Huo Danai looked at the detective with a questioning gaze. At that time, the car had arrived at the entrance of the morgue. So he said nothing; when they arrived there, they saw the tearful Mrs. Bai Dewan and her brother waiting in the office. After exchanging a few words, they followed the coroner, the professor, and the port detective into the cold hall. There, on a stone slab, was displayed a gray-green, swollen corpse.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bai Dewan gritted her teeth, took a look, and shouted, "That is not my husband!" Then she fainted. Her brother also affirmed his sister's statement. That person was definitely not Bai Dewan.</p>
<p>"In such a case, mistaken identification is bound to happen. Lang Sheng, I find your opinion not only suspicious but also strange and laughable," Professor Huo Danai continued, "A very contradictory fact has already revealed your mistake, which you should have known long ago!"</p>
<p>Please tell us! Smart readers, what does the professor mean? The answer will be revealed tomorrow.</p>
<p>Low Profile</p>
<h3>Beware of the Appendix</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>Hong Kong is China's appendix, be careful, prevent "appendicitis," very important, very important!</p>
<h3>Just So-So</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>Students from Shanxi are now launching a campaign to drive out Yan Xishan, attacking the old man Yan "completely," seemingly a large-scale movement. In the end, I dare to guarantee without a doubt that there will be no problem. Didn't Anhui Province also stage this act last year? And Li Pinsan is still "sitting firmly in power."</p>
<h3>Aborted Ending</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>A few months ago, in the capital, a court official was arrested for drug use. Knowing the law and breaking it is doubly guilty, but the ending is unknown.</p>
<h3>Winter Scene</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>A wanderer, wrapped in straw and rags, shivers under the corner of a wall. A mangy dog beside him also huddles into a ball. Passersby all say that these are two pitiful animals without any difference?</p>
<h3>Two Kinds of Profit</h3>
<p>— Zili Sheng</p>
<p>Student: "Teacher, how many kinds of profit are there?"</p>
<p>Teacher: "There are two kinds, one is legal profit, and the other is patriotic profit. The benefit that a merchant obtains in accordance with the law is legal profit. Buying from foreigners and selling to foreigners, what you earn is patriotic profit, for example, woolen blankets."</p>
<h3>Sanmao</h3>
<p>— Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>Weekend Chat</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>Wool Comes From the Sheep</p>
<p>It is said that the "translation breeze" (dubbing) of movie theaters will also be taxed. It seems that the authorities are making every effort to "leave no stone unturned" in opening up financial resources and enriching tax revenue. According to the Finance Bureau, the city's financial revenue is increasing every month "due to the continuous soaring of prices." Last month, it exceeded 8 billion in October and reached over 10 billion. This is certainly good news for the development of the city's future. However, what we worry about is that the increase in tax revenue is probably an alarm for rising prices. How sensitive are merchants? To cope with heavy taxes, they must plan ways to compensate, and as a result, the burden is still placed on consumers with fixed incomes. After consumers' purchasing power weakens, stores, under the dual pressure of heavy taxes and high-interest loans, will also quickly declare their inability to support themselves. The closure of the Gao Shiman Shopping Center, which had just opened for over a month, is one example. In these precarious times, the death knell has already rung. We cannot help but express some fear and anxiety regarding the increased tax revenue gained "due to the continuous soaring of prices" and the taxation of the "translation breeze"!</p>
<p>"Corruption Formula" One</p>
<p>Nameth, a Hungarian acting inspector of the Jianghai Customs Police, was arrested and brought to the court for trial on corruption charges. During the trial, we can analyze his criminal facts as follows:</p>
<p>Time: During the months of April, May, June.</p>
<p>Method: Through 24 instances of underreporting fines.</p>
<p>Amount: Embezzled 245,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Motive: To treat his teeth, unable to afford it.</p>
<p>Defense: Driven by the pressure of life, out of desperation.</p>
<p>This analysis can be called the "Corruption Formula." It seems that most current corruption, regardless of East or West, Chinese or foreign, adopts this formula. For example, wasn't the embezzlement case of Wu Suiren, the chief of the cashier section of the Executive Yuan, last month also an exception? It's just that the amounts differ slightly.</p>
<p>Breaking Officialdom Conventions</p>
<p>Director Ouyang of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office took office at the beginning of the month and "did not hold a ceremony, which is a departure from officialdom conventions," according to reports. It can be seen that having a ceremony for taking office has become a norm in officialdom. By extension, one cannot speak without using "official jargon," nor can one write anything without a bit of "official investigation." Officials are the parents of the people, so of course, they must be different from the people. Initially, when Liu Bang saw the First Emperor's tour, with escorts like clouds, he had the heart to "take his place." Zheng Banqiao, occupying a seventh-rank position, could never climb higher. Seeing the pomp and circumstance of the governor's proclamation, he indulged in sensual pleasures and did not seek advancement. Therefore, if "official air" is too strong, it will have negative consequences, either making people too passive or too active. The way to moderation is to reduce the "official flavor" and interact with the people seamlessly. Director Ouyang is pioneering a new trend, a virtuous official governing the people, perhaps close to the ideal?</p>
