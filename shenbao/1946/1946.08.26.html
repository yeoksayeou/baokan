<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民主同盟昨日下午三時，假戈登路上海酒樓招待新聞界。到張君勵，張東蓀，梁漱溟，沈鈞儒，羅隆基，章伯鈞，及各報社記者七十餘人，黃炎培因病未參加，除印發書面談話發表當前國是主張外，首由羅隆基補充書面談話內容，提出三點希望：（一）立即停止內戰，（二）實施政協決議，（三）對昆明，北平，成都事件，主持公道。繼由梁瀨溟報告赴昆明調查李聞案經過，說明：（一）此次赴昆係代表民盟單獨進行調查工作，（二）調查內容不久將發表有系統報告，（三）要求將本案移解南京組織特別法庭審判。繼張東蓀報告北平孫中原「被綁」經過，對孫中原脫離民盟事，表示懷疑。羅隆基復對民盟主席張瀾在成都被打事，作一簡單報告，謂尚在調查中。最後各報社記者提出問題，由民盟代表分別答復，茲誌問答如次：</p>
<p>問：國家社會黨與民主黨政黨全組民主社會黨後，不知新黨與原有國社黨之基本觀念，有何區別，民主社會黨與民主同盟關係如何？</p>
<p>孫寶毅答：民主社會黨政綱即將公開發表，可資說明，至與民盟關係，目前仍為民盟一份子，但民盟對外發表任何文告，須先徵得本黨同意。</p>
<p>問：盛傳張東蓀氏將繼續從事教育工作，態度消極，不願通輯現實政治，不知曾否有此表示？</p>
<p>張東蓀答：本人上年在渝，曾向燕京大學請假一年，最近燕大復課，仍望返校工作，此次來滬，即係向民盟負責人說明此意，對於北平民盟工作，本人不能負全責，希望另行派人前往主持；至於參加現實政治工作與否，本人從未有此考慮，因政府改組，恐怕還很遙遠。張氏答畢，羅隆基并特別說明，張東蓀先生教育，并沒有脫離民盟。</p>
<p>問：民盟總體與組成份子間關係如何？</p>
<p>羅隆基答：民盟雖為一政治團體，其總體與組成份子間，並無嚴格約束，不能與國共兩政黨相比，同時這是民盟內部的問題，不需對外說明，故無等答覆之必要（羅氏答此問題時，情緒激動，似有不豫色。）</p>
<p>問：梁漱溟氏一向提倡鄉村自治，不知抗戰期間曾否繼續工作？外傳梁氏在政協會後，態度消極，表示不願參加現實政治，是否屬實？梁氏就村治運動觀點，對中共在鄉村所做工作，有何批評？</p>
<p>梁漱溟答：（一）抗戰期間，因環境特殊，不能繼續推進村治工作；（二）本人在政協會後，曾於二月二日在重慶大公報發表「八年努力宣告結束」一文，表明態度，不願參加現實政治；（三）村治運動與中共土地政策確有很大的區別。</p>
<p>問：哈爾濱最近成立所謂「民主東北臨時最高行政機構，聞民盟週鯨文亦參加期間，是否係代表民盟」？</p>
<p>羅隆基答：週鯨文確係民盟會員，但因渠係東北人，僅代表個人參加，不能即以為係代表民盟，而與中共合作。</p>
<p>五時許散會，民盟繼續舉行外記者招待會。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕廿五小組昨日下午赴安平調查，於該鎮居民曹玉亭之證言中，發現一新事實，即美共於安平衝突中，共軍曾俘虜美軍二名。另據政府方面香河縣班縣長證言，確有此事，刻共軍已將二美後予以放回，此不僅過去共方證人報告中未涉及此點，即歷次美方證人報告中，亦從未提及，故昨日曹玉亭報告至此時，美方代表馬丁上校似頗詫異，共方代表黃逸峯亦現不安之態，事後會議之停頓與決裂，與此新事實之出現似亦不無關係。據曹玉亭稱：彼於七月廿九日中午平律公路發生槍聲不久，即有在共軍包圍監視下之美軍吉普車與載重車各一輛自公路駛來，在其家門前略停，駕吉普車者為二美國軍人，彼等以不純熟之華語表示，願將軍槍交與共軍，但願共軍將其放回，但此請求當時彼共軍拒絕。至另一載重車駕駛者，則為八路軍，此載重車之被俘，亦不見於美方及共方各證人之報告，詢問至此，時間已六時餘，主席馬丁認為曹玉亭證言極為重要，因時間過晚，暫行回平，明晨再來安平詢問，共方代表黃逸峯則堅持當晚詢問完竣，否則將更予政府方面以假造證據之機會，馬丁笑謂：「安平事件發生已將一月，直到最近我們才能進行調查，想假造證據的，已經有快一個月的充裕時間了，我們還是不必在乎這一天罷。」政府代表張叔衡說：「我到中共區的香河，聽取中共指定的證人證言，而沒有任何話說，偽甚麼你到安平來，便持這樣態度呢？你說政府假造證據，而不可靠，有何根據，請你答覆。」黃對此始終未答覆，會議遂告破裂。是日曹玉亭報告別一新事實，為七月廿九日共軍襲擊美軍，曾令安平一候姓將其牛車及另一鄰居之牛車趕至平津公路上，放阻路途，並於放置不久後，即於公路上截得汽車一輛，楊姓司機腿部被共軍擊傷。</p>

<p>— 邵鴻鑣</p>
<p>從一年前一直到現在，中國政治所走的路還是「拖」！「拖」非但不能解決問題，而且把問題愈弄得複雜，愈不易得到解決？馬歇爾特使與司徒大使的奔走斡旋，并沒有使國共談判接近些，而且這幾天情勢，雙方正醞釀着未來的大戰。一般人民因常受到共產黨歪曲的煙幕宣傳，以及若干政客有組織的播弄是非，大都陷於迷惑、苦悶、憤怨之中。至於外國的朋友，往往很率直的衹知以現代的民主理想來衡量中國的問題，以為只要喊一聲「民主」就可把問題解決。但結果呢，問題非但絲毫沒有解決，而且枝節橫生，戰爭到處蔓延？</p>
<p>我們察看中國政治問題，不能忽略中國特殊的國情。中國和現代任何國家，卻有些不同。</p>
<p>第一，中國遠不及英美等國，民主政治還沒有完全成長。最高民意機關迄未設立，現今的參政會，雖可說是各黨各派與無黨無派的代表機關，但參政員的產生，并不全是基於人民的選舉，且其職權也只限於審查建議與諮詢，其民主成分顯然很少。至於國民代表大會，依法自然是全國最高的民意機構，對於國家的重要問題有決定的力量。但這個機關此時還沒有成立，而它最被攻擊者有兩點：（一）國民代表的產生還在十年之前，而國家社會經過了八年大戰，顯然起了很大的變化，他們能否完全代表今日的民意，不無問題。（二）國民代表和選舉，是用單選舉區制，就是在一個選舉區內，祇憑多數票選出一人為代表，這樣，大會議席多數必然被大党所佔。因此，國民黨所提召集國代大會解決國是的建議，共產黨老是反對。國家目前沒有正式的最高民意機關，解決國家重要問題，自感困難。</p>
<p>第二，中國的武力，今天完全受政黨的控制。政黨的武力，祇能為政黨效忠，受政黨指揮。一旦政黨要反抗中央，推翻政府，其武力也就成為反抗搗亂的工具了。在現階段，國民黨代表着中華民國國民行使政權，故國民黨的武力就成為國家的武力。而在這次抗戰中，他們抵禦外侮，捍衛國家，也確已盡了國家軍隊的職責。但是共產黨的武力，仍挾其偏狹的黨派觀念，從事於傾軋爭奪。在抗戰期間，他們不斷在國軍後方施行突擊，收繳國軍的槍械，擴充自己的地盤，削弱國軍抗戰的實力，這都是事實。但他們要利用抗戰機會，擴張其武力，以便與國民黨抗爭，也就顯不得國家民族的利益了。共產黨人缺乏國家民族的觀念，為一般人所詬病者在此。但在共產黨，正挾其日益坐大的武力，準備向國民黨奪取政權，如果向它提出放棄武力的建議，根本上違反了其奪取政權的目的，共黨口頭儘管允許，而終必遭其拒絕。</p>
<p>第三，中華民國在名義上是統一的國家，國民政府是世界所公認為代表中華民國的合法政府。在統一國家中，軍隊的統率和最高的權力，應當歸諸中央政府。但在中國，在野的共產黨因為握有武力，所以割據了三百多縣的地盤，作為政爭的根據地。中共的軍隊，固非中央所得節制指揮，在其割據區內，且已實行階級鬥爭，建立了蘇維埃式的「邊區政府」。這種日開澎漲而以鬥爭為任務的勢力，必將繼續破壞和平，斵傷國家元氣！</p>
<p>除了上述三點以外，國共兩黨還有一個基本的矛盾，無法調和的，就是彼此都有些專政的傾向。不過國民黨的「專政」，最後是要完成訓政，還政於民的，故僅是實施民主黨政的過程，而共產黨的專政，則為其制度本身上有永久獨裁的要求。現在共產黨時常指摘國民黨為獨裁，實則平心而論，共產黨比國民黨理要獨裁。公正的美國記者也如此說。因為共產黨所取無產階級專政的蘇維埃制度，是以階級鬥爭為奪取政權的工具，其手段的暴烈和殘酷，以及謀略的險狠陰毒，為世界革命史上所少見時。蘇聯共產革命的成功，是採取大恐怖大流血的政策，消滅了其他階級，肅清了其他政黨，才能建立其基礎。但中國國民革命的情形是不同的。國民黨的道德思想是忠孝仁愛信義和平，這些是中華民族特有的王道精神。國民黨在其革命過程中，隨時有博愛寬容的表露，例如軍閥放棄了武力或表示覺悟，信仰三民主義，國民黨即不加以誅伐，且多畀以職位，使得共同為國效力。假使共產黨站在國民黨的地位，那末，其他階級以及政見不同的人，都將無存的餘地。而且還有無數的大流血，大恐怖，表現着獸性的殘忍，尖刻，和酷辣，會把國家民族的元氣，斵傷殆盡。那裏像國民黨，雖然握了政權，還能容納其他黨派的存在，並且還要實施黨政，還政於民呢？現今共產黨正企圖以暴力奪取政權，一面卻以假惺惺的宣傳煙幕，麻醉青年，欺騙庸俗，這僅是共產黨歪曲了心腸所作的宣傳技巧而已！</p>
<p>當然，我們不能否認國民黨自北伐以迄抗戰後的今日，還一直保持了一黨專政制度。但這是出於掃除障碍和抵禦外侮上的必要，乃臨時的過渡辦法，國民黨革命建國的終極目標，是在建立民有民治民享的全民政治國家。這是國民党領袖對於全國人民的信譽。但是共產黨的獨裁則不然。現在共產黨在其各割據區，正展開所謂「三資鬥爭」，目的在消滅有資格（有智識）有資望和有資產的人，而純粹以無產階級組織政府。可見共產黨在鬥爭時期所取的軍事獨裁，也是其鬥爭後永久的政治制度。這一點，是和國民黨根本不同的。惟因共產党的鬥爭目的在建立無產階級的獨裁，所在要共產黨承認國民黨的地位，謀取兩者間永久的合作，真所謂「緣木求魚」，儘管去年「雙十會談記錄」有永久合作的諾言，也是沒用的。在共產黨實力未充足時，也許為策略上的運用，暫時承認和國民黨合作，但到了實力充實時，還是要消滅其他一切政黨而完成中共的獨裁局面的。最近中共迭次向善意的調人挑釁，欲使之知難而退，可知它對於協商談判，絲毫沒有誠意的了。</p>
<p>反過來看，國民黨無數黨員，半世紀來為革命建國而灑熱血，拋頭顱，既已獲得了政權，也決不肖輕易放棄其建國的任務，而拱手讓給共產黨去實行那至少國民黨員認為不合國情的共產主義。所以共產黨想以劣勢的武力和「拖」的方法，要把國民黨拖倒，國民政府拖翻，實祇是一种徒勞的空想。</p>
<p>不過，這確是一個僵硬的局面。國共兩者間，已試用了種種調和方案，但都歸於失敗了。究竟可否以和平談判來解決這糾紛呢？</p>
<p>現在約略看一看先進國家革命建國的前例。自德意日軸心國打倒後，現世界各國，在政制上，可分為兩大類：一是民主的國家，可以英美為代表；一是極權的國家，可以蘇聯為代表。英國民主政治的發展，可說是一部民權和君權的演進史。自十九世紀以來，英國君權不斷地縮小，而民權卻不斷地發展。到了一六八八年光榮革命以後，君權已全被民權所壓倒。當時的自由和保守兩黨，前者主張民權而并不反對君主政體，後者擁護君權而亦不反對議會政治。於是二者的政策，頗有調和的色彩，并不趨於極端。故數百年來。兩黨交相執政，相處得很好。降至最近，則保守黨與工黨對峙，兩者對於議會政治之根本立場亦同其信賴。美國的獨立，僅是殖民地人民反抗英國而得的解放。其政治理想是根據十九世紀的民權思想。在其建國過程中，北部諸邦因工商業發達欲開拓市場，主張各邦為地方團體，而南部諸邦則全係農業社會，欲保持割據局面，主張中央僅為一聯邦，雙方各不相讓，且均握有武力，於是引起了所謂「南北戰爭」，——這就是史家所謂「內戰」。最後，南部失敗，美國才成為統一的聯邦國家，而美國的富強乃肇基於此。蘇俄共產黨在十月革命奪取政權後，就以嚴酷的手段，毫不留情地，把其他階級和黨派次弟消滅，由是蘇維埃政府得有鞏固的基礎，完成其共產主義的建設。</p>
<p>以上三國的例子是說明什麼？（一）英國的例子是在說明：一國之內，如有二個大黨，都無黨的武力，其政見相距又不很遠，并無根本牴牾之處，而且其國的人民又有高度的政治水準和正確的判別力，那末，這一國的政治問題，很易循常軌來解決。（二）美國的例子是在說明：一國之內，如有兩種不相統屬的武力，向着同一空間發展，而對於國家的構造觀念又有根本不同，則必然會發生衝突而起戰爭。當時美國，如用談判方式，必先承認分裂的局面，則美國統一的聯邦國家也就無從建立了。惟有先經過統一的戰爭，才能談到和平與民主。（三）俄國的例子是說明：一個憑藉武力奪得了政權的黨，為確保其地位，實現其主義，必須要把反對黨—至少其武力—消滅，否則，國內的秩序不能穩定，政策無由實現，民生日形困苦，而終致民心散失，日就澌滅。這正為反對黨造成「取而代之」的機會。</p>
<p>中國目前的情勢，在武力分裂的局面上，很有和醞釀南北戰爭時期的美國相像。在國民黨掌握政權這一點上，又很和十月革命後的蘇俄相像。而和英國，則在任何方面，都沒有相類的跡象。你能叫國共兩黨效法英之自由黨與保守黨麼？共產黨能放棄其階級鬥爭與無產階級專政的主張麼？要想把中國變成英國，可能嗎？中國現在的局面是南北戰爭時美國的局面，是黨派武力割據地方的局面；也是蘇俄十月革命前後的局面，更是共產黨想奪取政權的局面。假使當時美國的南部不放棄武力，而北方與之作和平談判，那末只有兩條路可走：（一）承認國家的分裂，兩國對峙，各行其是。（二）一方無條件把武力交給對方，——但這是不可能的。當時如走第一條路，則南美在保持奴隸制度和自由貿易等政策之外，對北美究竟是否沒有其他野心？若分裂為兩國，釐定疆界，或許能保持長久的和平，但統一是不可能了。中國的共產黨，當他沒有地盤時，尚且要暴動，爭奪地盤，現在有了相當的地盤和武力，在沒有實現其中華蘇維埃政府的全部計劃以前，肯放棄其爭奪政權的種種企圖麼？過去南北美的情形，究較今日的中國為簡單，以林肯總統之仁慈，尚且終有賴乎兵力為之解決。而在中國反想始終嚷着和平協商，謀取解決，又怎能有效果呢？再議蘇聯，假使共產黨在十月革命奪得政權後，不能迅速地把反對黨派肅清，那他的政權，決不能鞏固，共產主義也就無法實現了。而且時間拖延以後，人民必然感到苦痛，對當權的政黨必漸感失望而起離貳，於是愈求問題解決而問題愈不易解決了。不幸的，中國目前的情形，正是如此！</p>
<p>中國的國民黨，既不能如蘇俄的布爾什維克，能迅速地消滅反動，鞏固政權，又不能取法美國的林肯，以兵力結束南北時對峙的局面，使國家進於統一安定之域，而一味徘徊在歧路之上徒然增加人民的痛苦，這真令人不解。</p>
<p>我們對於國共兩黨，并沒有偏見，不過這種僵局必須設法打開，免得釀成大患。作者現在鄭重提出下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）全世界都在厭惡戰爭，中國人民在九死一生中得到了解放，已經力竭精疲，再不能忍受戰亂。</p>
<p>（二）中國人民對於現狀固不能認為滿意，但并未絕望，並且正在督促政府求取進步，共產黨若以劣勢的武力，少數的地盤，想把國民政府推翻，造成長期的混亂，斷送國族的生命，實是違背了人民的意向。</p>
<p>（三）共產黨的存在，和國民黨實施黨政的原則，并不違反。我們不主張政府對共產黨的政治活動取壓迫的態度，但是共產黨軍隊如仍割據地方，破壞統一，我們應該認為是叛亂的武力，政府應速加制裁，不能聽其蔓延猖厥。</p>
<p>（四）我們認為鎮壓叛亂是一回事，開放政權又是一回事，共產黨不應以反對把持政府為藉口，掩護其叛亂的行動；國民黨也不應以共產軍隊之割據為藉口，延展其開放政權的實施時期。換句話說：政府應一面鎮壓叛亂，一面趕快結束訓政，實施憲政。真正的憲政實施了，共產軍隊也就失其倡亂的藉口；叛亂的武力削平了，憲政的實施也會更覺得順利。故二者應雙管齊下，同時并進。</p>
<p>總之，中國的政治問題，應當以人民的幸福和國家的元氣為衡量的標準。現今人民最怕的是內戰，正一致祈禱着內戰的倖免。但如果叛亂的武力，企圖推翻政府，迫使政府出而討伐，那末，我們袛好一致擁護政府，集中全國的力量，來粉碎這叛亂的攻勢。如此，可使戰爭於最短期內結束，人民的痛苦和犧牲也得減至最小限度。（卅五，八，廿二於上海）</p>

<p>〔本報綜合消息〕據聯合社巴黎電，烏克蘭外長馬努爾斯基廿四日招待記者，宣布彼正向聯合國機構安全理事會提出申訴，指希聯政府在巴爾幹危及國際和平。據稱，英軍之留駐希臘及英國代表爲帝制派直接干涉希臘內政乃巴爾幹局勢阮隍不安之主要因素。馬氏請安理會於下次開會時，檢討巴爾幹全部情形，其危及和平，實由希臘政府所採之政策所致。希臘定於九月一日舉行公民複決，而外兵駐境，擁護與德　侵路者合作份子，未免違反聯合國機構憲章之目的原則。在此種情形下舉行公民複決，亦將遠反聯合國於戰時及戰後所宣布之戰爭目的，承認各國皆有自由決定其命運與政體之權利。希臘現政府所採不負責任之政策，允其自和會開幕以後所採者，已引起一種局勢，對於巴爾幹之安全有嚴重危險。希臘與阿爾巴尼亞交界處會發生無數邊界事件，均由希臘武裝部隊挑　，並受希臘當局鼓勵。希軍曾向阿爾巴尼亞邊境守衛隊開槍，幷向從事耕種之阿爾巴尼亞農民開槍。此等事件，與希臘武裝部隊之侵入阿爾巴尼亞領土，其目的顯欲挑動對阿爾巴尼亞之戰爭，以藉口佔領其南部領土。烏古蘭此項控訴，係響應南斯拉夫副總理加拉傑一週前在和會中指控希臘之辭，據稱希臘外長蔡爾達理斯曾提議由希南兩國瓜分阿爾巴尼亞者。馬努爾斯基續謂希臘現政府代表之公開宣言，及其在和會中之演說，堅持希臘與阿爾巴尼亞之間有戰爭狀態存在，已使巴爾幹局勢更形緊張。希臘政府壓迫馬其頓，色當斯及伊比魯斯之少數民族，致避居鄰國者以數萬計，俾免遭受屠戳。馬其頓與色雷斯均在希臘北部，保加利亞欲得之以通愛琴海。伊比魯斯則與阿爾巴尼亞接壤，希臘曾有改正邊界要求。馬努爾斯基之結論爲今日巴爾幹之危險情形，實係英軍駐希及英國代表爲帝制派干涉希臘內政所助成。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕此間消息靈通人士相信：在南亞英特別專員吉倫之到達巴達維亞，乃由於英國欲先知解決印荷現行爭端之前途，蓋英國現在荷屬東印尙駐有大量軍隊。英外部發言人稱：英國並無派高級外交官參預調解之企圖。</p>

<h3 id="c79">接收後的公濟醫院　改善設施適合需要報務範圍日益擴展 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>偶然的機緣，去參觀一下衛生屬接辦近年的公濟醫院，該院創始於一八六四年，是當時的外僑官民集資興辦的，最初的院址在舊法租界外灘，租屋一椽，十二年後才在今日的院址上——蘇州河白渡橋西興築起新的院舍規模才漸漸確立了。向來院務規定由董事會全權處理的，去年九月，市衛生局委派朱仰高醫師接收該院，即以舊行制度為依據，擬定了新舊事會的閑織辦法。由董事十一人組成，人選為：英國旅滬僑民二人，美國旅滬僑民二人，醫藥專家四人，當有聲望的地方人士三人，其中包括中外籍保管董事各一人。後來經吳市長對該院向日組織，作縝密研究後，認為以前擬定的董事會組織辦法，仍未盡善，還應加以修正，現正策劃進行，該院的新董事會可能在短期內正式成立。</p>
<p>在朱仰高醫師——今日的院長的壓毅奮鬥下，現在，已把風雨飄搖中的醫院帶上了欣欣向榮的途徑。在以前，公濟醫院僅僅是給予外人便利，國人要想進去，只能住頭等病房，還必須遵守英美的生活規律；現在，當然，但問疾病，不問國籍，中外一律待遇。以前，共有病床二百架，醫師僅僅院長和駐院醫師各一人；現在，病床已擴充為三百架，各科醫師都已騁致齊全，任何治療，都不需假手院外醫師。此外，清理雜物堆積室，開設十餘間門診部，整理院旁空屋及工役住所，另開傳染病院。這一切都是這短期內的發展！往日醫院總開支，需要舊工部局補助百分之三四十，今日，擴大了服務的範圍，經濟則能完全自給自足，即使在最最艱苦的接收整頓期間，也僅僅向衛生局貸過五十萬元，但是很快就償清了。其餘都賴私人周旋通融，再從積極努力擴充業務求彌補，從來不賴政府的補助。</p>
<p>為了體念公務人員的生計艱困，他捫首先訂了優惠公務人員的辦法，除了半義務性的體格檢查外（具備各種必要的檢騐，僅僅收費四千元），住院，門診和治療費用都折減。同時，特別優待平民，在各科分設平民病床一百架，每日一共收費五千元。更有一部赤貧免費額，完全義務。此外，當勝利之初，盟軍時肇車禍，當局特地首請該院，協助治療傷人，經治愈的統計亦達數百人，而所取報酬，破格低廉。該院並為了市區人烟稠密。常有受傷或急症發生，特地專設急症部，日夜服務。並且，為培養新一代人才，特地選拔醫校優秀學生，入院實習。這種種，無一不是接收以後的新貢獻。</p>
<p>院主人的殷殷招待，陪我參觀整個醫院，從最高的第一層起，真的連廚房浴室也沒給漏掉。內部設備，雖然我是個外行，但是經過詳細的解釋，對於那些近代科學所到達的至高境界，亦為之神往，或者可以說讓我長了不少見識。像那一連排的開刀間，其中有一間割尿道的設備，聽說是最新穎的，猶為獨步滬上。此外，新經粉刷的全院房屋，整齊和清潔，工作人員的勤謹，空氣的肅穆，秩序的井然，任憑如何外行，都能領略到的。</p>
<p>對如此成績，朱院長絕無沾沾自喜，他正計劃決心大事擴充，以求達到與歐美一樣水準的一個完全醫院。同時他們並且表示，如果日後醫院的經濟更見穩定的時候，他們還希望能減低一般的收費標準；雖然，他們現在已經比同等規模的宏恩醫院來得低廉了，（楓之）</p>
<h3 id="c80">信不信由你　中國銀行大保險庫規模雄偉舉世無雙　鋼板層層砲火不畏機關重重滴水難進 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕信不信由你，世界上箱隻最多，規模最大的保管箱庫，正躭在外灘中國銀行大廈的底層。這個保管箱庫裏，大大小小的箱隻，連五間保管庫在內，總數一共是一萬一千一百九十三隻。據說：美國最大的銀行保管箱庫，也只有八千多隻箱子。</p>
<p>記者承該行保管股主任蔡逸民君的引導，在這個巨型庫房的內外，瀏覽了一番。先由電梯直達地下層，開出門來，就是間小方型的琉璃室。這是顧客進入保管庫的第一間。三面的琉璃牆，都是一寸半厚的防彈玻璃。用厚厚的鋼槽，鑲湊而成。裏外只能相見，而不能傳聲。在正中的一道琉璃牆上，開了一個很小的鋼槽盆，和一個純鋼的通話筒。顧客進來時，先得在槽盆處出示證件，在話筒裏通話，認可之後，進了第一道門。</p>
<p>第二道門，是最複雜也是最龐大的一扇庫門了。這扇庫門，連門框共重四十五噸。完全是用不熔鋼鑄成的，但兩副門柚裏，每副都舖滿了十幾層鋼珠承杣，所以門的轉動，靈活非凡。只要一個人，費很小的力氣，就能推動了。</p>
<p>門的外形是圓的，厚薄約在兩尺之間。門的週槽，分裝了二十四個插門，只要稍稍轉動門前的度盤，這二十四根插閂，就一起伸展出來，活像個齒輪，插在門框的槽隙裏，這樣，門就鎖上了。</p>
<p>說起這門的開關來，有兩副極複雜的對字盤。此外，還有四具小鐘。平常都經校定了時間。對字盤對準了，還得等小鐘走到了已校定的時間，才能把門打開。例如說：中國銀行保管庫平常營業的時間，是自上午九時至十二時，下午一時至四時。他們就把這四具小鐘，預先照這個時間校定好。所以通常要是對準了開鬥的字盤還得等到上午九時，才能把門打開。這種精密的開門設計，（一）在防止已知對字盤開關的人，在夜半或營業時間以後，啟門而入。（二）在防止盜匪，在夜半脅迫行中員役啟門。</p>
<p>庫門的首層，滿貯氣體。如果有人想偷偷地鑿穿這扇門，那末剛鑿穿第一層時，這氣體就會冒出來，可把鑿門人昏倒十幾小時，但不致命，這扇門，平日關上時，水就無法進去。可是還有萬一的設備，那就是門槽裏還　了一層開　　　，一碰到水，就會自動的膨脹起來，立刻　　了這扇門可能發生的一切隙縫。</p>
<p>通過了這扇複雜的庫門，再經過一道比較簡單的鋼柵門，終於達進了庫房。保管箱大小一共五種，密密層層的整齊地排列成段。最小的箱子在上層，愈近底層，箱隻也愈大。段與段之間，都向隔着鋪了油地毡的走廊。庫內的燈光，是用特殊設計的日光管子燈照明的。一平排地，鑲嵌在各段上層的邊緣，光綫極為柔和而悅耳。</p>
<p>每隻箱子的外衛壁，都是半英寸厚的純鋼板鑄成的。要開一隻箱子，須經過三重鎖。箱外有兩個鎖眼，開箱時，要顧客的一柄，和庫裏一柄外衛總鑰匙，同時插入，方能開啟。開了箱，取出了箱瞻，還有一重鎖，由顧客自己開啟。</p>
<p>除了大小五種保管箱外，還有五間像一般電梯間大小的保管庫。預備為大量物件貯藏之用。要是東西的體積太大了，可由顧客將原物封好，交給庫裏原封保管，由庫掣給收據。這批原封保管的東西，是保管在「庫中庫」裏的。</p>
<p>原來，保管庫的本身，除了大花板及地板，都是密密層層的鋼板封固外，圍牆厚達兩尺。內外層都是極厚的鋼板，內層的結構，全是鋼筋水泥·鋼網，鋼板等混凝而成。這層圍牆外，隔一道闊約四尺光景的走廊，就是銀行的最外層圍牆了。這層牆的內壁，佈滿了粗細的電綫。日夜都有巡警在這道狹窄的走廊裏巡　一番。所謂「庫中庫」就是在這個保管庫中，再構築一間牆厚二尺的小型庫房。</p>
<p>庫房裏，有最新式的氣流和氣溫設備。庫內的溫度，常年保持在七八十度之間，大熱天裏有冷氣，大雪天裏有熱氣。氣流的出和入，都有一定的路綫。所以庫房雖牢對在鋼牆鐵壁的地下窖內，空氣和外邊一般無二，但溫度却舒適得多了。這種氣流和氣溫的設備，決不會使保管品腐蝕霉爛。記者不禁懷疑到這氣流的入口處，許會變成庫房的一大漏洞。但不！氣流的入口處，也有專門控制的一間，也是那末一扇複雜而須對字開關的門。氣可流通，但却不能借此而越雷池一步。</p>
<p>這個保管箱庫的原料，來自美國約克鋼鐵公司。據說：在菲京馬尼刺某一家銀行裏，也有同樣設計，而規模較小的保管箱庫一間。此次菲京焦土戰，這家銀行的房子全被轟燬了，但這間保管庫，却碩果僅存，原封未動。還有，中國銀行虹口分行，也有同樣設計的小型保管庫一間，敵偽盤踞時期，日本人化了幾許心血，想把它打開，結果終告失望。所以戰前保管在庫裏的東西，勝利後仍未動秋毫。這是保管箱歷史上的奇蹟。你要享受這個奇蹟的　，只要向中國銀行信託部，　最小號的保管箱，　。這個一般人購買力　貴重財物永久的</p>

<p>上海市學生總會，爲抗議學校提高學費，於昨（廿五）日發表宣言，探誌於下：同學們：在道將近開學的時候，我們突然聽到學費高漲的消息，實在感到有些不寒而慄，以辦敎育爲生的學棍，不顧政府的國策，敎育當局的命令，家長的負担，和同學的學業，決定鉅額提高學費，這是在威脅我們，迫我們多數同學失學。這種不加鄭重攷慮的舉動，如果不是由我們同學自己來加以抵制，來加以抗議，恐怕今後還要更不堪設想。爲挽救當前的敎育危機，爲謀取全體同學的福利，爰敢提出辦法數端，希望敎育界人士賜予採納。第一，我們要請各校當局，按照物價比例來計算學費，切勿單憑主觀臆測，毫無根據的增加學費，希望能顧全學生家長的負拒，和一次支付學費的困難，在學校經濟公開，每學期預算平衡的原則下，將學費作合理的調整，並且制定分期支付辦法，使各位家長的負担相形减輕。第二，我們要求各學校，至少設置百分之二十的免費學額，藉以解決淸寒同學的失學問題。第三，我們要求政府及敎育當局，對各校無理提高學費，作切實有效的制裁，同時根據實際情形，對辦理完善各校，極力予以補助與獎勵，以導誘教育界向上求進的精神，根絕市儈流毒的傳染。第四，我們要求各界切實協助教育貸金運動，捐募的鉅款，以濟助眞正淸寒同學，能使繼續學業，免受提高學費的威脅。同學們！我們爲了自己的學業，爲了今後兄弟姊妹們的學業，都應該堅決反對敎育界的學閥習氣，打倒把學校當市塲學生當商品的市儈作風，但是這還不過是消極的辦法，我們應該積極的爲自己謀取福利，减少失學機會，現在我們學生總會，跟敎育貸金會合作，推進貸學運動，希望用自己的力量來解決自己的失學問題，然而工作的成果，還需要全體同學共同的努力，有錢的出錢，有力的出力，一方面反對提高學費，一方面替淸寒的同學作預先的安排，共同來渡過這學費高漲的難關！我們堅決主張：（一）反對無理提高鉅額學費！（二）反對一次繳費！（三）要求各校經濟公開，提高敎師待遇，盡量節省開支，减低家長負担，反對私校校長操縱財政，營私舞弊！（四）要求各校多設免費學額！（五）要求政府指撥專款，發展敎育，增加同胞求學機會！（六）要求政府，切實協助，推進敎育貸金運動！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕草地網球男子高級單打，陶冠球卡遜，獲得決賽權，昨日下午三時半起在膠州公園舉行複賽，陶冠球直落三淘汰謝兆良，卡遜亦以直落三戰勝王文正。</p>

<p>（六—四）　（十四—十二）　（六—四）</p>
<p>五文正</p>
<p>陶謝之爭</p>
<p>膠州公園內之網球塲，佈置尙佳，觀衆千餘人，爲網球賽久已未有之盛况，惟草地欠完美。第一塲陶謝之爭，謝擊法姿態尙可，而自殺之球櫐櫐，反手允無把握，遠非陶冠球之敵手，一二兩盤，毫無競爭可言，第三盤，謝於零比四落後時，第五局起連下四局，居然造成各四平手，陶卒以六比四獲勝。</p>
<p>空前苦戰</p>
<p>卡遜王文正之賽，於五時　之開始，王文正非卡遜之對手，惟昨日亦特別努力，一三兩盤，卡遜皆以六比四獲勝，第二盤竟苦戰二十六局才分勝負，殊出意外，全賽共費約二小時半，可想見競爭之劇烈。卡遜遠抽短擊，攔網高壓，無一不佳，其反手允百無一失，王文正固尙遜一籌也。第一盤卡以五比二佔先，王追成五比四，卡又再勝一局。第二盤大戰，卡又以五四佔光，次局之發球局竟吿失落，於是五比五後，難解難分，雙方精疲力盡，直至第二十五局王文正之發球局被擊破，卡遜乃以十四比十二得勝。第三盤形勢已定，四比四後，卡遜再以六比四吿捷。</p>
<p>週四決賽</p>
<p>卡遜將於廿九日（星期四）下午在膠園，與陶冠球決奪男高單打王座。今日下午，原有女子單打複賽二塲，仍在膠園交兵，昨據主辦當局通吿，柯拉沙夫人對朱芝瑛小姐之戰，改至明日下午五時半舉行，今日下午五時起，僅羅費詩小姐對屈洛利夫人一幕門票照舊。</p>

<p>決賽經過</p>
<p>兩隊實力不相上下，勝負亦有幸不幸也，惟友隊隊長黃明　　殺厲　，全　較務本爲穩，分數常見此起彼落，緊張萬分。務本蕭傑英首先發球，第一分爲友隊所獲，比數起伏動盪，易地時，友隊以十一比九超前，再度　觸，友隊以二十比十六遙領，務本力追迫成二十平芋，結果友隊以廿二比二十勝第一局。第一局，務本全力以赴，競爭劇烈，張敏玉連獲四分，務本領前，未幾友隊反攻，十一比八超前，嗣後戰成各十二，十四，數造平手，務本以廿一比十五扳回一局。最後一局，生死關頭，戰來更見猛烈，務本先聲奪人，友隊不甘屈居，連呼五分，務本力圖掙扎，前排缺乏關煞，致爲友隊所乘，黃明緩屢施突擊，獲分累累，結果友隊以廿一比十二輕取第三局，總結二對一，友隊力挫務本。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海市蔬菜地貨運銷聯營商塲滬南區商塲，衆於昨日下午二時，假寗波同鄕會舉行成立大會。出席會員八十四人，互推沈企超爲臨時主席。行禮如儀後，當由主席致詞，及報吿籌備經過，略稱：此番籌組商塲，頗多週折，幸頓各同仁努力奮鬥，市政當局及社會局等予以協助指導，方吿籌備成立。按本市蔬菜地貨同業，自上海市農產市塲撤銷後，經營塲地，即發生困難。緣戰前各同業，均各有塲地房屋碼頭等等設備，戰時大多均吿燬損。且敵僞時期，强迫集中「中央市塲」營業。勝利後，該「中央市塲」，即由農產市塲，予以接收。迨農產市塲解散後，同業問驟失集中之大塲地，聲業無法開展。</p>
<p>商塲成立經過</p>
<p>遂聯合各區同業，向市府請願救濟。本年六月你那廿四日，得市府批示，對所請表示同情，並准粗織聯營商塲。七月五日，又得社會局批示，准予備案。茲南區商塲幸吿成立，今後業務開展，尙有賴同菜通力合作。在顧全農民成本，及販客之合法利潤下，努力抑平蔬菜地貨價格。旋由社會局派駐商塲監督吳翰邦致訓詞。最後通過章程卅一條，選舉理監事。開票結果，當選理事戚四品，沈企超，戚品甫，董曉成，唐永昌，吳寳成，張守仁，盛榮金嚴慕雲，湯木祥，馬文彪十一人，監事章孝方，王岳廷，卜汝樵三人。候補理事姜文煥，陸文寳二人。候補監事龔品梅一人。大會即吿散會。旋即續開首屆理監事會議，互推戚四品爲理事長，沈企超，董曉成，張守仁，馬文彪四人爲常務理事。即席並聘沈企超爲商塲經理，馬文彪爲副經理。</p>
<p>將分三區營業</p>
<p>滬北區商塲，早於七月廿日成立。理事長爲金渭漁，商塲經理爲潘亦均，副經理爲沈文彬。現本市蔬菜地貨業運銷聯營商塲一機構下，已成立之分區商塲，即此滬南滬北兩區。西區則正在籌組中。南區會員，現有九十五家。地區包括董家渡，黃家碼頭，大碼頭，十六鋪，黃浦灘路一帶。塲址設南市裏馬路六十號。北區會員有一百二十家，地區包括老閘，頭壩，新閘，曹家渡等。塲址設西藏北路廿一號。凡屬本市蔬菜地貨兩業同業公會會員行商，經由各該業公會證明者，均得加入爲聯營行商。</p>
<p>並不强制加入</p>
<p>惟並不含强制性質。各行商經營業務原則，係向外埠如蘇州無錫等地，採辦地貨來滬，補充本市四郊所產蔬菜之不足。故各行商常於各地農村下種時，貸款予各農民，以便補充種籽，原料，及各種設備等。待　物成熟後，即交由各行商經售，此爲各行商之主要業務。</p>
<p>據會塲中若干領袖人氏語記者稱：蔬菜地貨一項，忱質與其他貨物不同。（一）易於腐爛，故無法囤藏。（二）轉輾搬運，旣費重力，耗損亦多。故至各菜塲出售之市價，必較商塲略高。平常菜蔬價格之貴賤，咸決於供給之多寡。　例如最近因天時乾熱，蔬菜毫量减少，此爲年常五月至九月間，所常見之事。故一般蔬菜市價，遂不無騰貴。惟一俟蔬菜產量復常，價即下跌。佣金方面，本市行商自貨主取百分之三十，向攤販取百分之三。此項佣金率，據稱較其他各地，均爲低廉。現南北兩區商塲，每日營業額約爲七千萬元。本市四郊菜販挑貨來市，沿途未聞有被强留過秤之事發生。果有之，則商塲當籲請有關當局，切實制止。至南北兩區之塲地問題，現大致可設法逐一解決。棚屋方面，業由農產市塲淸理處，請市政府一社會局等，會同評定價格，由各行商集資承購。塲地方面，因多屬私人地主所有，將由各行商與之另訂契約，一決定承租或承購。</p>

<p>華茶　出業對外匯調整後，我國茶葉外銷情况，認爲仍少樂觀。據該業中人談稱：作爲華茶外銷主要市塲之美蘇兩國，對於華茶價格及品質方面，迄猶爭執未決，關於對蘇易貨，中信局曾與蘇聯駐滬商務代表團舉行商被，該國旋派專家一員來滬，負責　　　茶，其價格擬根據紐約華茶市個，　中信局方面，以爲紐約茶市爲陳茶價格，如欲購本年新茶，則產地成本須加入計算，蘇方對此，迄未同意，致羣茶銷蘇延未解決，如僵局無法打開，則本年華茶銷蘇，迨少希望，至美國方面，茶葉限價，紅茶最高級者爲美金五角七分折合法幣亦僅一千九百元，綠茶最高級者，爲美金四角八分半，折合法幣一千六百二十元，現輸出新茶每斤至少二千四百元，差額達五成之巨，故各茶商尙未能考慮新茶之輸出問題，現時銷美華茶皆爲陳茶</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪化粧品工業同業公會理事長胡伯翔氏，叩以匯率調整後，對一般國貨工業之影響。渠稱：此番政府決心調整匯率，對國內工樂裨益當匪淺鮮。並稱：日來最好之現象，莫如金價之平穩。較匯率不調整前，所漲極微，洵屬難能可貴。惟深望糧食及其他主要工業原料之價格不漲，俾工業生產成本，能照舊維持不變。以化粧品工業近况言，數月來飽受外洋私貨貶價傾銷之威脅，中小型工廠，已有若干家收歇。大型廠家，亦感維持爲難。深望因匯率調整結果，對此不利現狀，有所補救，淮中央近頒發貨物稅條例中，對化粧品一項之課稅額，竟高至百分之四十五。胡氏特別指明：現時國貨工廠所產之化粧品，大部係屬日用必需品如肥皂之類。課稅過重，非惟不符實際，且將摧殘該一工業之發展。故業於日前召開理事會，具呈由工業協會轉請當局予以豁免。據吿：化粧品工業以及大部國貨工廠之產品，通常銷路，均以廣大之農村爲主。故農村購買力之恢復與培養，實爲常務之急。同時，深望時局早靖，交通早日恢復，則國貨工廠之產品，當能暢銷內地。至南洋市塲，現仍因國內物價水準過高，尙未能言大量輸出。即有之，亦多屬零星及嘗試性質之交易而已。</p>
<h3 id="c115">中國經濟在轉變中 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 平</p>
<p>抗戰期中，稅收劇减，出支頻增，財政維持，端賴發行；雖其數字未經公吿，然財政當局自知甚明？故一旦勝利，即專事緊縮通貨，因而採用下列各策：（一）高估法幣兌換率，以减少通貨發行；（二）高價出售敵僞物資，收回更多通貨；（三）配售黃金，套取國內游資；（四）用某種企業的專營國營，以裕歲收。惟軍事未已，縮編未成，致未獲預期效果，而反使物價工資，互爲因果；更使國外管理之下舶來物資暢銷國內，比例刺激之下國產無法外銷，形成目前經濟不安的危局。</p>
<p>此非謂緊縮通貨之不當，蓋通貨原來不宜膨脹。惟僅緊縮通貨，不過官民財富的易位，仍無補於國民經濟。亦非謂緊縮通貨之無效，蓋究已幸免馬克盧布之覆轍。惟僅恃緊縮通貨，祇能穩定幣値於一時，難期持久。今官民爭利經年，忽有工商業代表赴京請願之行，及中紡紗布出口之請，則官民之間，均感須有易轍之處。然則吾國經濟前途，或有順轉之兆　。</p>
<p>軍政尙未澄清，經濟何能獨善？惟當此入超驚人，工商凋疲之秋，行見破產頻仍，失業遞增；故吾人實已不能待軍政之敉平，即須有經濟之補救。即原則上須偏重經濟之效用，而以國民經濟爲本；又須改革財政之「唯收」主義，而易以支出之節約。蓋民富而後國富，節約方能平衡也。今姑勿論久遠之策，若僅就坐而言立而能行者，予以積極實施，或亦可稍挽狂關於將倒也。</p>
<p>啓如由美貸而取得之美棉，若用作紡織復員，及國內布荒之需，則利僅救濟失業於一時，少舒八年之積困而已。然美貸不常有，濟急有餘，治貧乏術，一旦製品盡爲消費者吸收，則非特外滙美棉，兩無以繼，且此復興中之紡織業，亦將重返衰落矣。今若將製品或與針織業等易得之複製品，運銷，國外，則於國外市塲利吾時，除取回原額外滙，以資購買美棉，連續生產外，其剩餘物資，旣可濟國內之荒，又可易取其他重要原料，以復興其他工業。苟國外市塲於吾不利時，則以少額代價。維特國內大量勞工生活，而節約政府救濟之支出外，仍得維持美棉及外滙之來源矣。</p>
<p>又如報載，六合永利公司，以缺乏煤與焦炭，致不克製造肥粉。査肥田粉爲山地農作物不可或少之原料，乃今於糧荒聲中，該公司竟無以爲國家盡力，殊可惋惜。若政府能以煤炭易其肥料，配售山民，則生產之增加，即减免政府救濟之支出，又可節約洋米之外滙。若更能有餘，運銷南洋各地，則國外不需之國煤，居然亦能獲取賽貴之外滙或重要之原斜，以啓發國內其他工業。以其循環生產及分配，均爲互利互生，故物價可由是而抑平，生活指數，亦可由是而低落，遂使其他農工產品，成本驟减，而利於外銷矣。</p>
<p>革命固非安樂，民主允非自私。放民主先進之英美，迄今尙從事於物價之管理，物資之配給。管理與配售，實無傷於民主，然決非壟斷與獨佔可比。今由政府以貸借而得之美棉，似可按生產能力，均勻分配於國營民營各廠，以花易紗，以紗易布，或其他針織品等，除必需工資外，並予以合法利潤。而各項製品，不能先供國內銷費，應由政府集中，以特准方式，運銷國外。此所以避免私人之暴利，亦所以免國外市塲之自競也。至於其他農工產品，又何嘗不可以類推乎？（酬資移助蘇北災民）</p>

<p>被譽爲「砂糖王國」的台灣，現在却正因爲砂糖的高價而招致省內人民經濟生活的不安，這是空前絕後的　驚夢似的，在過去半世紀，從朱碰到過。他們可以如數家珍似的團憶着不久以前的砂糖底價格：</p>
<p>去年八月前　最高價每斤　六角</p>
<p>去年八月後　最高價每斤　十元</p>
<p>去年十一月時　最高價每斤　一元五角</p>
<p>本年六月終　最高價每斤　二十元　（七月起按日漲一二元）</p>
<p>本年七月十六日　最高價每斤　五十元八合法幣一千五百元）</p>
<p>十天之內突破了四十元大關，以產糖之區而吃着如此高價的糖，實駭人聽聞。砂糖正國的夢是破滅了。</p>
<p>台灣人每年消費量</p>
<p>台灣人吃糖，素來不感到是一種負担。全省糖的消耗量以六百萬人需四萬噸計，每人平均年消費額爲七公斤，看看世界別的地方就可知道本省消費並不大：</p>
<p>澳大利　年消費糖額</p>
<p>平均每人　五四公斤</p>
<p>美國　年消費糖額</p>
<p>平均每人　五〇公斤</p>
<p>英國　年消費糖額</p>

<p>瑞士　年消費糖額</p>
<p>平均每人　四二公斤</p>
<p>加拿大　年消費糖額</p>
<p>平均每人　四一公斤</p>
<p>日本　年消費糖額</p>
<p>平均每人　一二公斤</p>
<p>中國（內地）年消費糖額</p>
<p>平均每人　二公斤（註）</p>
<p>台灣人的糖耗量，遠不及日本人，而糖產總額曾達一百四十六萬公噸（一公噸合內地二千公斤），這樣鉅大的數字，現在果然威脅了產糖區，却是値得硏究的！</p>
<p>〔註〕根據四川甘掛試驗塲調査，國內年產四十一萬二千九百公噸，輸入糖額平均爲六十八萬八千公噸，合計千百十萬零公噸，以此數作爲全國年消費量。</p>
<p>光復後有多少存糖</p>
<p>據糖業中人吿訴記者，本省的存糖量也是相當大的。在去年的總存糖量統計有八十四萬公噸，其中汲炸毀了約三十三萬公噸，尙存有五十二萬公噸，可是這個數目續見減少了。當日本投降台灣前進指揮所成立時，存糖只賸了三十萬公噸，經過一個月的監理時期，又減少到二十四萬公噸，而到接管時期僅存了十五萬公噸了。</p>
<p>這十五萬公噸的糖，政府方面以二萬公噸運滬作交換肥料和其他的物資、秘密輸出的走私量以半數計，那末目前至少還有五萬公噸的　量，而本年度預定的產景約八萬六千噸，照理足供本省三年以上消耗的，其價格不致如此騰貴，而事實上恰正相反。</p>
<p>糖價怎麼飛漲起來</p>
<p>構成台灣糖價飛漲的主因，大致是，</p>
<p>（1）食糖消費特稅的增加，這是內在的。三月一日調整價是日本人時代的二倍，六月二十一日再調整又增加了二倍。過去白糖百斤的稅是十七錢五厘，兩度增高爲七十錢。二千斤以上的還要課附加稅，商人徵收營業稅。</p>
<p>（2）西北部沿海岸的大量走私，這是政府去年公佈査禁私運食糖出境辦法所引起的副作用。商人不能在第一期登場的新榖上打算，便轉到富有誘惑性的糖身上來，冒萬險運往日本和國內。</p>
<p>（3）禁止食糖在省境內自由販賣，產銷不能保持平衡，在產區台南，台中嘉義一帶的價格，較合北低百分之二十，但要注意的是充斥產區市塲的都是紅糖，白糖像被藏諸金屋的閨秀，不易購到，基隆高雄港口的糖因爲裝運不及，也有發霉的。</p>
<p>這三個原因都是直接决定於當局食糖對策的刺激，間接的就是不能增產這事實，它却影響了人民的心理。</p>
<p>台糖能增多少產量</p>
<p>日本人統治台灣的當初，食糖的年產量僅有粗糖八—九萬斤，日本統治者爲達到殖民地經濟榨取的目的，運用政治勢力壟斷台糖業，由三井，三菱，籘山，鈴木之流的財閥投資開發，以小惠誘致農民種蔗，設法改良甘蔗栽植，更補助並保護新式糖廠，結果打穩了製糖工業的基礎，最高的生產額達一百四十六萬公噸，（根據一九三八年至一九三九年的統計）可是現在呢，木年上半年預定生產只有八萬六千公噸，僅的先前產額的1／17而已。</p>
<p>在一九四一年八家瑭業公司併剩了台灣，日興，明治和鹽水港製糖公司四家，擁有四十二處的新式糖廠，要是全部以廿四小時開工，能壓榨原料甘蔗六萬一千八百五十公噸，甘蔗平均含糖率以百分之十三計，每日製糖總額最少八千公噸。這四大公司，擁有蔗田十二萬一千八百五十八公頃，土地投資額台幣一萬萬一千八百四十七萬元，又有自營農塲面積五萬六千二百十公噸，敷設私有鐵道長二四九三公里，投資總額計台幣四萬萬九千九百八十三萬三千元。</p>
<p>光復以後接收的四十二處糖廠，有廿五處被炸毀了，僅有十七家開着工，而開工的還須加以修理，被炸毁的是否能於短期間重建，頗成間題。關於栽植甘蔗的總面積是九萬一千四百二十五甲（每甲合十六畝餘）依繁植方法分配，新植面積是八萬一千六百九十甲，株出面積九千七百三十五甲，壓根兒談不到增產的。</p>
<p>難題橫在增產前面</p>
<p>台糖的不能增產，下列諸問題是頗重要的：</p>
<p>A，已開工的如何增產，不能開工的如何使其從速復工？</p>
<p>B，九萬餘甲的蔗田，每甲以〇·五噸計，需要硫安（化學肥料）四萬五千噸，過去是全部仰給日本的，現在救濟總署撥來了三千噸，　胡椒末似的撤給全省第二期稻作都不够。只好以每甲一二五磅分配在台南一帶的稻田，蔗田是更其沒有希望的了！</p>
<p>C，農林處不久以前，曾召開蔗糖事業討論會，對蔗的增植，施肥，製糖等都有决議，當時大起爭執，幾至不能繼續討論下去，結果商定了改用分糖法制度，比例是四·八與五·二，即實際蔗糖率所得的產量中，％52歸廠方，％48歸蔗農作蔗價！以分蜜白糖爲分糖標準，農民應得的糖，二十分之一實物自用，餘糖折取現金，另組評議會在十二月至四月間評定價格。這個辦法，使蔗農均有躊躇觀望，都將改種稻作和雜糧了。日本人是對付蔗嚴採取强制手段和施以小惠的，目前這辦法是行不通的！</p>
<p>D，台灣沒有精製糖廠，有的統在日本，這是日本統治者使台灣完全成爲殖民地主要做法之一，和製造肥料一樣，從殖民地取去原料或粗製品製成上等品給他自己享用，只把製造原料糖（次白糖）的新式糖廠留在台灣，這個問題，目前似乎還沒被人顧及，但却是一個難題。</p>
<p>義大利故事重演？</p>
<p>台糖現在的管理機關是台糖股份公司，這個公司尙在籌備，但是繼承光復以後的接管，改由資源委會與省公署公營，當不致於代以官僚資本，而仍然只是榨取蔗農的。但人們對於台灣各企業的中國化，實抱有非常的隱憂。</p>
<p>記者碰到好幾位糖業技術工作者，他們不是感慨於公司當局的不能重用原有的技工，便是說來了一批「文字技術者，」他們沒有把復興的工作作爲工作，邊論忠誠奉公？他們坦誠地說：台灣的復興，以目前進展的效率來衡量估計，談增產至少要在三，五年以後，這個悲觀的論調，使記者想起了Iohn　Hersey所寫的「亞丹諾之鐐」，他吿訴着義大利人民辛苦栽種收獲的甘蔗，在法西斯統制之下，政府强制收購了，他們享受不到，每年只能在聖誕時，千方百計的買到一點，被視爲珍貴的奢侈品的糖。台灣會不會搬演義大利的故事，是不必杞憂的，但很可能要繼續的上漲，上漲到連辛苦種植的蔗農都沒法享受。</p>
<p>你能信實嗎？深信政府，專家，蔗農各方面都會協力來打破這難關，挽救「砂糖王國」的危機的，因爲砂糖不只是台灣的特產，而且是中國的至寳！</p>

<h3 id="c117">津洞天舞廳發生坍屋慘劇　「驚人節目」竟演出如此一幕 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 本報十四日天津航訊　特約記者李紹林</p>
<p>天津市中心區於十三日下午一時許，忽發生一舞塲樓房塌陷傷斃多人慘劇，出事處所爲第一區長春道洞天舞餐廳。屋頂舞池全部塌落，樓下一品香，佩文齋兩商號，均遭砸穿。</p>
<p>轟然一聲塌陷</p>
<p>中時一時三十五分左右，洞天舞餐廳樓下一品香號內同人，忽聞樓頂悉悉作饗，牆壁顫動，諸人情知不妙，遂急急外奔，並連呼樓房要塌，詎知一語未了，轟然一聲，樓頂已全部砸下，洋灰舞池，直由四樓貫穿，跌入一品香號內，隔壁佩文齋亦被砸透一部。一時烟塵彌漫，行人在奔，一品香及佩文齊中，先後有多人逃出，俱如泥人。一品香之職員朱紹湘未及逃出，被壓於二樓之上，司賬員王連升則爲大塊洋灰砸於樓下，警局聞訊後，立即出動員警及消防隊搶救，並請美軍工程隊協助，先後開到起重車三輛扒拆，消防隊員首將二樓之朱紹湘救下，王連升則賴美軍自灰士中扒出，救出後均已血肉泥土，一片模糊，即時送往市立第六醫院敎治。樓頂塌陷之時，一品香門首甫停有三輪車一部，車夫聞警逃竄，僅受微傷，三輪車被砸粉粹。同時，另一行人江寳華，適行徑該處，奔躱不及，立被砸倒，頭部受傷甚重，當即送往　　　　，但生命甚爲危臉。</p>
<p>天大禍造成</p>
<p>洞天舞餐廳，原在該處三樓營業，曾於大樑牆壁間擅自闢門，已使建築支持力失去，入夏以後，又復將四樓普通平合改建爲舞塲，近經改組，加砌洋灰舞池，方於三日前開業，肇禍原因，即係重量過鉅所致，且該處廿八年曾經大水浸泡，三十三年又遭一度大火，本已不甚堅固，卒竟釀成此禍。出事後，洞天經理王耀祖，即告逃跑，該廳股東吳輔庭已由警局傳訊。津市今夏，舞風在起，屋頂花園之舞塲允爲流行。經營者叭利是圖，建築不合理者，比比皆是。此禍一出，或可使經營者清醒一下，聞警局對該舞廳曾因其無太平門一度勒令停業，該舞廳遂牆中關門，領得開業執照。</p>
<p>工務局長勘查</p>
<p>天津市工務局長閻子亨，副局長梁錦萱，聞訊後即到塲勘査，閻局長談稱：凡建築物改變用途時，均須先向工務局呈報，由工務局派員檢査，認爲適宜後，發給許可證，然後方可變更使用。而洞天舞廳，以平台改舞塲未向工務局呈報，加築洋灰舞池，更未向工務局呈報，於此若干人想及，凡公共塲所，應勿待呈報而後査。同時由社警兩局准許開業所反映的，是局與局之間竟沒有聯繫。閻局長又謂普通建築，每方尺負重量不過四十磅，而舞塲每方尺之負重量，要達一百磅至一百二十磅，則洞天舞廳之塌陷，已爲必然之事，果能事先檢査，當能免此大禍。</p>
<p>驚人節目表演</p>
<p>舞池塌落後，除當時逃出及事後救出之各人外，據已經確知者尙有兩人被埋於斷垣殘壁之下，一爲一品香同事劉樹德，一爲良友餅乾公司赴該號送貨之王樹勛，入晚始由消防隊人員發掘。</p>
<p>所幸出事時間爲中午一時半，茶舞猶未開始，倘使於茶舞或晚間紅男綠女舞興正濃時而發生此禍，則死傷將不堪設想。記者於街心觀察，見洞天舞餐廳新油漆之朱紅大門，尙完好無恙，門旁貼有海報一張，上書特約侯寳林郭啓如每晚十時表演驚人節目，何期「驚人節目」竟如此的表演！</p>
<h3 id="c118">世界人口和糧食　思北譯自「美國人」雜誌 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>世界的治亂有人認爲與人口的多寡有直接的關係。第二次大戰雖然死去千百萬人，但人口的總數還在增加。假若保持現在的生殖率，再過十年，會增加二萬萬人口。在本世紀之末，世界的人口最少會多出五萬萬來，若不加以節制，恐怕要增加十萬萬人。</p>
<p>但世界各國都在獎勵生育。英國即在詢問子女太少的母親。生第二個孩子的母親，政府予以獎金。法國政府成立了一個委員會，計劃在十年內增加一千二百個嬰孩。</p>
<p>俄國照現在的生殖率，四十年後，人口可加一倍。現在仍用獎章，獎金等以鼓勵多產的母親，不結婚的男人則課以重稅。</p>
<p>軸心風家如德義日在第一次大戰以前業已人口過剩。因爲人口過剩，所以生存的競爭更爲激烈，人民便更要服從能够給他們麵包的統治階級。軸心的野心家同時獎勵生殖，製造砲灰，去開拓疆土。</p>
<p>美國感覺人口的壓迫是木世紀才有的現象。以往因爲在開闢中，土地是無限，人口不嫌其多。</p>
<p>現在世界各地，很少不感到人口過多，食物不足的壓迫。西默在一世紀之前已經感到人口過剩之苦。亞洲紛亂的原因亦由於此。非洲·南美·及澳大利亞都很快的消耗了他們的資源，並因人口增加太快，以致一般人的福利受到影響。</p>
<p>美國本身稍感人口過剩，但其兩個附屬的地方，菲律濱及波托里科（Puerto　Rico）死亡率雖高，但其人口每三十年增加一倍。美國須加以救濟，始能免於飢荒。　我們現在又加了一種新責任，把日本變成一個民主國家，我們把七千五百萬日人趕回他們的家去。現在日本每一英方里的耕地的人口，較美國多十三倍，每年又新添一百萬人口。只把土地重新分配，並無濟於事。</p>
<p>用科學的方法固可增加食物的供給，但食物的供給增多，人口的增加恐怕會更多。所以只有節制生育，並無其他解決糧荒的方法。</p>
<p>凡是資源及貿易密集的地方，其生活水準必甚低。因爲這種資源由很多的人分享。而且在文化落後的區域，人口的增加特別的快——如非洲·南美·東南洲等地。這些地帶的生殖率不必增加，只要他們採用西方醫藥衛生的方法。以减低死亡率。而增加普通人的壽命，則人口的過剩就很可驚了！</p>
<p>印度若把死亡率减低和美國一樣，生殖率還保持現狀，在一百年後，要有五個地球才能够用。</p>
<p>有許多人還堅信數目和力量有直接關係。人多即可戰勝。假若美國的安全繫於人口之多少，則在開戰之初就敗了。兩次大戰均靠美國轉敗爲勝。可見在近代戰爭中，人力並不十分可怕。將來在原子戰爭中，人力更居次要的地位。人的聰明智力才是競爭生存和取得世界和平最有效的力量。</p>
<p>一個國家要有超出日常生活的剩餘的物品，在今日才能戰勝，美國所以能戰勝軸心國者，就靠了驚人數量的物資，斯太林在德黑蘭會議時曾說，『沒有美國的物資，就不會勝利』。</p>
<p>我曾經說過，美國亦微感人口過剩。魏波頓敎授說道：『從每個人所得到的經濟福利的觀點看，美國的人口是過剩，但其過剩的程度不如大多數國家之嚴重而已』。</p>
<p>從經濟的觀點上看，美國若只有一萬萬人口，則較現在的一萬萬四千萬爲優，但據美政府估計，我們的人口將要增加四千萬人之多。所以在最近五十年之內，我們的生殖率應該减少三分之一。</p>
<p>試一考慮美國資源的减少（前內政部長已在美國雜誌發表）以後土地因耕種方法不愼的消耗，就覺得人口增加的可怕了。</p>
<p>農田的薄薄的表層的土壤，普通不到一尺厚，是我們的生死的關鍵。若去掉一寸，至少要三百年才能復原，但有些農田經一次豪雨，就會損失一寸。美國的農田保護委員會的主席曾經宣佈：『我們每天因爲風吹雨打所損失的田地，等於二百個四十畝的田莊……實際上，美國已經沒有好田地了』。</p>
<p>比田地的腐蝕更嚴重的是人民的腐蝕，我們人口的增加，完全由於敎育最低，成功最少，而智力最人下的們的生殖率的增高。</p>
<p>根據許多研究，說明這種可怖的現象。據人口統計局的數字，美國的母親受過七年或七年以下的敎育的，平均生三又三分之二個孩子，但同樣年齡而有中學或學院程度的母親，平均生一又三分之二個孩子。</p>
<p>另據美國四個城市的學校兒童的調查，智力最低的兒童，來自平均有六個兒童的家庭，智力特優的兒童，則來自平均有兩個半兒童的家庭。</p>
<p>這種情形若繼續七十年，我們最無智慧和最無成就的家庭的後代，較諸最有智慧和最有成就的家庭的後代要多出十六倍。（節譯「美國人」雜誌）</p>

<p>— 十日長沙航訊　特派員高元禮</p>
<p>社會的安全，交通的暢通，可以促進復興，湖南的社會秩序，雖是經過長沙幾次小紛擾，大體上說是安定的，而交通方面呢，自罟漢鐵路全錢通車以來，給人們以一個極大的興奮。</p>
<p>粵漢鐵路收入　不敷開支</p>
<p>粤漢鐵路全程一千五百公里，綰　南北，貫穿三省，卅三年全路淪陷，收復後，積極施工修復，據該路局長杜鐵遠氏報吿：該路破壞之烈，爲全國各織路之冠，大橋一一九座，破壞者一〇二座，小橋六百座，破壞者一六〇座，隧道完全破壞者五座，所有鋼樑均已毁壞搬走，重要路基土方，全被挖毁。修復預算，本年初預定爲三百七十億，因物價高漲，一切設備，祇好從簡，以通車爲第一目的，故現時之所謂通車，實仍祇認爲初步通車，距正式通車之標準尙極遙遠。如橋模均係木便橋，車站粟房站台及煤水設備等，均屬臨時性質，隧道未能完成者，亦用便橋繞行，而木質便橋，均有被大水冲毁之虞。現每週對開特別快車二列，貨車每日一列，依照本路路綫之長度，與運輸之預期數量，預計需機車三七六輛，客車三九〇輛，貨車三五四三輛，但現時已就殘存中修復者，僅大小機車八十輛，（短少二九六輛）貨車一四一一輛，（短少二一三一輛）客車八四輛，（短少三四二輛）以上車數，以之分配於一千餘公里之全路，自難望有充分之車次。全路目前每月收入約可逹十億以上，但開支即需四十億元，尙須賴政府之補助。可見該路困難情形之一斑。</p>
<p>易家灣覆車案　車站被搗</p>
<p>工程方面，俱係臨時性質，通車以來，肇禍事件，業已數起，最大者莫如易家　覆車案，七日武長貨車，由長開至易家灣車站，進入二股這時，因天雨關係，路基土質泡鬆，枕木下陷，鐵軌無力支撑，致機車出耿，車廂二輛，同吿傾覆。該列車本無客票，但有多人擁擠搭坐機車上，機車出軌後，直衝覆於路基下，乘客立即死七人，重傷十一人，傷者運回長沙後，又死一人。而乘車之少數軍人，未明眞相，質詢站長，竟將易家灣車站搗毁，頗有損失。據路局中人稱：該局因限於材料及經費，致工程無法照預定計劃進行，而行車安全，自亦將大成問題。路是通了，但不能立即加强設備，實屬遺憾。</p>
<p>工賑築路計劃　逐步實施</p>
<p>社會安定，交通恢復，災情改善以後，政府已轉移目光於建設事業。省政府爲加强本省公路網，擬定工振築路計劃，預計修復戰時破壞公路九一三公里，新修公路三〇六〇公里，共需工款七百廿一億元，可容納災民七十二萬一千五百人。此項計劃，正逐步實施中。該計劃完成，湖南全省各縣汽車均可到達，此爲王主席大規模工振計劃之一部。</p>
<p>此外，省府爲研究憲法，實現憲政，以及促進文化建設與經濟建設起見，特設憲政研究，文化建設，經濟建設三委員會，業經省府會議通過，即可着手成立，湘南的復興也許可以通過這三個委員會而得到具體的計劃。</p>

<p>當國軍正進駐吉林時，四千萬東北人民所最關切者，尙非吉林市之安危而是「小豐滿發電所」安全問題。「小豐滿」在吉林的西南方有四十餘里的路程在西山之中，將松花江水切斷築堤成爲人工瀑布用以發電，它的堤的長度與重量不僅遠東第一在世界上亦佔首位，發電量僅次於美蘇而佔世界第三位，這樣遭受破壞，東北各大都市頓成黑暗，它影響治安，工業，生活之大，是可以想像得到的。</p>
<p>松花江的東岸是發電所的工廠地帶，西岸是管理區及住宅，四面環山江水橫流，景緻異常幽美，東西兩岸由鐵橋一座連緊，現已破壞。</p>
<p>離「小豐滿」一二里之遙，就可以聽見隆隆之聲。看到十條人工瀑布由堤翻飛而下，堤上江水深達四十米，堤下則僅深下及一丈，上下水波均甚平穩經過堤孔則一瀉而下，有如萬馬奔騰，水勢兇猛，水花飛濺，極爲壯觀。</p>
<p>堰堤形式爲重力式，體積爲二〇〇萬立方米，堰堤全長一二〇〇M自左岸至右岸共分六千段每段寬十八立方米，高爲九十米，混凝之總量爲一·九二〇·〇〇〇立方米，貯水池面積五五〇平方公里，長一七〇公里，貯水量一一〇億立方米，自民國廿七年開工，至卅三年二月廿六日開始發電，動員二萬人日夜工作，經費原定一萬五千萬元偽幣，最後所費已達二萬五千萬元。該發電所可供長春，哈市，撫順，吉林使用。往長春者有松長送電所，長一一三公里。往哈市者有松濱綫，長二六五公里。往撫順三六〇公里，前二錢爲一五四JK，後者爲二二〇KU·二二，送電綫電壓之高，不僅中國第一，東亞亦所罕見。過去發電一九〇，〇〇〇基羅瓦特。若用火力發電一日需煤四·五千公噸。</p>
<p>蘇軍於去年八月二十日有降落傘部隊二三十人降落「小豐滿」。四五日後步兵亦到。九月二十日開始拆取機器，計有蘇軍二千名，日俘二千名，日夜拆遝十一月三日拆機人始去，總計所拆去者計有完成者二合瑞士製完成百分之五十者二台德國製完成百分之二十者二合德國製，拆去變壓器KU三台日本製，拆去OCB一五四KU三台日製日立！二二DKU二台日製日立！一三八U五合，拆去配電盤土木旋工用起重機二台！油類一列車，其他預備品無數。「小豐滿」之發電功用佔决要，其主要功用甚多，比如交通方面，在堤之上流水深四十米，可行四萬五千噸之戰艦，運木料方面可將上流「大豐滿」之木材由江水運至此處，然後裝火車運往各地，此外調解水利，便利漁業，都有很大功用，目前則僅發電，其他功用尙未能究全利用。</p>

<p>— Eric　Johnston著　包華懋譯</p>
<p>作者係前美國總商會之主席，積四年戰時與勞資雙方磋商之經騐，結語謂：爲美國工業平和起見，需要立新的法律，我國工潮亦在所難免，爰譯之作爲參考。</p>
<p>全美國都怕更多的罷工，我們的罷工次數實在太多了，物質上的損失龐大驚人，更糟糕的，人們因此懷着惡意和猜忌，道個國家需要工業調和，比任何事情都重要。</p>
<p>要想工業上永久和平，那簡直是胡思亂想，因爲勞資的關係是人類的關係，而人類的關係是常常在摩擦相爭之中。</p>
<p>我們不希望撲滅一切罷工，那只有集權主義國家才會如此。但是民主國家也希望勞資雙方增進他們的技術與制度而相處在一起。</p>
<p>一切工業戰事會引起勞工法的需要，人們常大聲疾呼：「通過法律，」這喊得那樣容易和便利，我們說，這個法律使勞資雙方各行其是，但是法律太强迫了亦不行，我們不能對「人情」（Human　Nature）立法，那是鐵一般的事實。</p>
<p>只靠立法是得不到工業和平的，但有幾種立法又是必需要的。我主張立法應建立公平的規則，對違反此規則者應受處罰，我們需要這種規則保護勞工，同樣地也保護資方。</p>
<p>讓我表明我的立塲，罷工權是美國人的基本權利，這必須永遠如此，但是罷工及罷工的原因可以設法减少。</p>
<p>許多人以爲罷工就是罷工而已，其實，罷工可分爲七類，讓我們分述之，並論其處置法。</p>
<p>（一）組織罷工：這就是一個工會罷工糾察員，强迫其他工人入會，並强迫該廠主與該工會訂契約。</p>
<p>這種罷工是不値得保護，這剝奪工人願吾加入該工會的權利，這是反動罷工，惠格南法案（Wagner　Act）設有選舉機關使工人表決他是否願入該工會，投票箱——美國神聖的傳統——代替了罷工糾察員遊行。</p>
<p>處置法：可把惠格南法案修改，不負責的工會應受處罰，該法律已有十一年歷史，憑過去經騐，我們可以知道它的利弊所在，把它修改適合現在的情形。</p>
<p>（二）管轄權罷工。這是工會與工會間因會員究屬那一個工會而引起的爭論，以致於罷工。</p>
<p>處置法：工人應組織工會管轄權問題委員會，以仲裁此事，當該委員會不能決定時，再由政府加入，中央勞工局應授權工人決定該工人受何種工會管轄，政府應强化中央勞工局處罰違章的工會及其領袖。</p>
<p>（三）同情罷工：此地工人因同情別處工人罷工而罷工，同情罷工的專門語已是荒謬絕倫，這不但是無理的罷工，而且也够不上同情。</p>
<p>處置法：道種罷工應不受法律保護，爲工人本身利益起見，工人應取消此種罷工，工人也不需要爲「同情」別處工人罷工而罷工。</p>
<p>（四）政治罷工：工人爲反對政府某種政策而引起的罷工。其實，工人可以與市民一樣用請願，會議，及輿論的方法達到政治的要求，不應以經濟武器作政治要求。處置法：也與（三）的處置法樣，此類罷工應不受法律保護。</p>
<p>（五）公用事業罷工：此種罷工直接影響大衆利益。公用事業，無論其爲公營或私營，皆應對政府負責，甚至，其利率，利潤，服務種類皆應受政府核准。</p>
<p>處置法：立法應設立仲裁機關處理此種爭論，鐵路仲裁法案可以作藍本。</p>
<p>（六）語言解釋罷工：這是由於契約上語言翻譯之誤解或是由於工頭及工人在契約上對某字及某詞解釋不同而引起的罷工。</p>
<p>處置法：勞資雙方協定先制止工潮，然後仲栽對契的之解釋，最好由能幹的，博學的及永久性的仲裁員負責處理，他們的薪水由勞資雙方供給之。</p>
<p>（七）契的罷工：這是由於工人要求改善工資，工作時間，工塲設備，這是容易明白也是最難解决，多數罷工都是屬於這一類，近來的汽車業，鋼業，煤業，及電氣業罷工也是屬於這一類</p>
<p>處置法：未罷工前使他們繼續談判，使這種討價還價的談判繼續下去，直到他們雙方訂立契約，那就听謂一面談判，一面工一場繼續工作。</p>
<p>爲完成此種談判，別的工會應組織工業調解陪審會，由勞資雙方代表參加，之後，再由政府加入調解。</p>
<p>在瑞士規定罷工者應事先七日通知政府調解，通知書內說明企圖罷工的理由，違反此規定者處以罰金，當然，原意是希望勞資雙方在未罷工前成立協議，道制度得到很大的成就，足資美國借鏡。</p>
<h3 id="c126">生產建設與提倡國貨 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 何人</p>
<p>勝利以後，生產建設的聲浪，普及全國，這實在是一個很好的現象。</p>
<p>不過，就筆者的愚見看來；生產建設，固然重要；但提倡國貨，使一般人都有「愛用國貨」的心理，却允其不可忽略。</p>
<p>因爲我們知道：生產建設，誠然是建設新中國的一個重要前提；但一方面儘管高唱生產建設，從事生產建設；他方面大量外貨，源源而來，國人咸歡迎外貨而鄙棄國產，那末，生產建設，豈不徒勞而無功？所以，生產建設和提倡國貨，要相輔而行，要取得密切的聯繫，生產界積極從事於生產的建設，社會團體，敎育機關，大家從事於國貨的提倡，要養成一般人「以服用國貨爲光榮」的心理，而後生產建設，才能達到目的，才能得到成功。</p>
<p>在目前，一般的外貨，已在源源進口之中，我們絕對不是抵制外貨，但我們却極端需要提倡國貨。我們希望敎育部，自下學期起，把愛用國貨的課材，印入中小學的敎科書內；學校敎師，以身作則，服用國貨；一般家長，也以愛用國貨勉其子女；政府機關，社會團體的主持者，也以購買國貨列入服務考績之中；全國上下，倘能一致的積極提倡國貨，生產界的前途，才會光明；建設的目標，才會一步一步的達到目的。</p>
<p>抗戰以前，提倡國貨運動，頗有相當成績。但經過敵僞八年的蹂躪，國內物資稀少，國人的生活，無日不在困苦之中，一旦勝利來臨，海運暢通，目睹新奇的外貨，自不覺手舞足蹈，爭相購買，這當然也不忍予以苛責的。但我們要放遠目光，要站在整個國家經濟上觀察，則提倡國貨，在目前實在是一件急不待緩的事。因爲唯有提倡國貨，才能保存微弱的中國民族工業；更唯有提倡國貨，才不會使生產建設的工作，中途脫節，甚而至於中途遭到崩潰！</p>

<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>丙，製造的速度</p>
<p>在製造工作的進行之中。所費的時間，是很値得考慮的，如果在每一個動作上而要多費上一點時間，那末在一月中或一年中所耗費的時問加起來，就很可觀了，這並不是說但求其速，一切可以粗製濫造，實際上是要在最低限度的時問之中，做成完美的出品。</p>
<p>要知道製成一件貨品，需要多少時間，最好的辦法是實行試騐，在一個製造廠開工的最初時期，是要實行試騐的，對於製造的速度的標準的定奪，有下列幾個方法：</p>
<p>A在開始工作的時候，記一個時間，讓工作進行，到了完成的時候，再記一個時間，就可以知道製造一件貨品所需的時問。</p>
<p>B有許多貨品，需要幾個步驟合併起來，製成一種貨品，如果從開始到終了共需三天，那末可以在三天的終了，檢點所製成的貨品的數目，就可以知道每天可出多少，每天工作八小時，那末平均每小時可出多少也可以知道了。</p>
<p>有了這個標準，就有下列三種用途：</p>
<p>A可以制定一個標準，每天可出多少貨品，如果在某一天的生產减少以後，就可以立時査考牠的原因所在，而加以糾正。</p>
<p>B可以使規劃生產計劃容易實行，響如說預備生產價值多少萬元的貨品，就可以算出共有多少單位，共需多少時日，有時候外界來了一批定貨，也可以計算出在多少時日之內，可以交貨。</p>
<p>C可以計算成本，對於生產所需的時間以後，就可以計算成本。</p>
<p>一個從事生產的製造廠，決不能隨隨便便，毫無標準，所以對於製造的速度，是要加以研究。</p>
<p>女工與童工</p>
<p>在很多的廠裏，除了男工之外，有許多女工和童工。届用女工和童工的理由，不外乎下列幾種：</p>
<p>A沒有問需要量相一等的男工：一個工廠，如果不能完全用男工，那末就以女工來代替</p>
<p>B女工的工資較低：女工的工資往往較男工的工資爲低，因爲女工往往不需要負担家庭的開支。男工往往有家庭的負担。至於童工，那末代價比女工更低，在有些地方，童工可以勝任，那末雇用童工，可以减省一點製造費用。</p>
<p>C女工較爲服從：在男女工人比較起來，女工是比較地服從的。</p>
<p>但這不能作爲雇用女工的最大的理由，不過是女工的長處之一罷了。</p>

<p>— 鄭午昌</p>
<p>余友方子介堪，名巖，別號玉篆，永嘉人。精金石書書，工篆刻。民十五年春來滬，吳昌碩，曾農髯，褚體堂諸老，交譽之，調其治印，無一字無來歷。從趙叔孺先生游。叔孺嘗云：可談印者，惟介堪一人。介堪曾爲其師治一玉印。耦至西泠印社，時高野侯丁輔之王福厂諸老，皆在座。輔之出叔孺玉印示福厂戲曰：某得此印，因名叔孺。福厂摩挲審視，以爲非漢人手筆不克臻此。輔之復曰：漢人今在座耳。始知介堪所作，嘆爲奇絕，一座哄然。任西泠印祉印刷部主任。旋任上海美專，新華藝專敎授，凡四五年，受其學者，多以名世。上虞經頤淵引爲知交，同居寒之友社，談文作畫，無虛日。上海法院知其工書精鑑別，聘爲鑑定人。恐鑑定不當，生是非，堅辭而去。廿三年冬至首都，頤淵招與對榻。介堪性好客，喜施予，典衣沾酒，不稍吝。頤淵知其貧，嘗餽以金，介堪曰：頤淵淸廉，此淸白錢，可受用也。常時名公鉅卿，得其一印以爲榮，名以籍甚。翌年秋，與頤淵漫遊太華五台諸勝，歸次大梁，以地富古蹟，搜求頗夥。廿五年春，至北平，宿大風堂，日與大千評印論書；大千所用印，皆出其手。時故都名流，如陳散原傳沅叔皆與之友，累贈以詩。敎育部舉行二次全國美術展會於南京，聘爲審查委員。旣南來，得間與方君壁謝稚柳諸子同辦雁蕩，少作勾留。旋應馬叔平之聘，任職故宮博物院，編輯考證昔賢名跡。時國府林主席，亦知其能，擬聘爲秘書，大千戲呼之爲方待詔云。然介堪到院之翌日，而蘆溝橋事起，困居數月，始得脫歸，閉戶不出。此後寇亂日深，偽府成立，曾延其主印局事。介堪曰：頭可斷，事不可爲，焚其書。王季思有文誌之，見浙江日報。抗戰八年間，永嘉度遭轟炸，三度淪陷。介堪提携老幼，輾轉流亡，備歷艱苦。其母病且危，親侍湯藥，任洗滌，衣不解帶者六晝夜，病賴以痊。寇至，復他徙，瑞安李一飛以其屋居之，始稍定。寇在永嘉，索其治印，勿獲，恨之；而土劣又時加逼辱，是時介堪之苦，眞有不可勝言者。然始終不爲敵僞治一印，人益以是高之。寇既降舉國慶勝利，介堪乃製印賦詩志之：「萬國旌旗展碧空，今朝喜見九州同，人間從此銷鋒鏑，我亦高歌擊，壤翁。」介堪治印，初學讓之；嗣宗秦漢。嘗鈎摹古印，得數萬字，曰爾印文粽，因亂未付梓，常時兩厂幼潛曾與同編；旋因事不果，叔孺視其編訂精博，以已稿助之，俾集大成，云古玉印匯，即其手著也。介堪每治一印，不用思索，奏刀立就，不違古制，篆宗大李；隸書法史晨。初畫以博古名；近寫山水及松梅菊石，亦古拙多奇氣。常世工篆刻而硏精文字學者，無不推重介堪；善書能畫之士，而攷究印章者，無不有求於介堪。人皆愛而憐之；而介堪樂而不倦，窮而益奮，自去秋來海上　所治印，不下千數百方。一日過我望平廔，有客迎之曰：此公滿身皆金石氣，非方光生耶？夫使人望而知爲方先生，豈偶然哉。</p>
<h3 id="c130">墓地一角 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 陳瀅</p>
<p>天空藍得近乎透明，疎落的幾片白雲在慢慢悠悠地移動，像輕烟那麼忽聚忽散，又似薄霧那麽濛濛茫茫。蒼白的圓月孤單單地伏在一端，將它冰冷的光芒溶溶流注於大地。</p>
<p>原野盡情地向四周舖張，可是被一抹黑黝　的山巒給隔斷了，或或的荒草隨着風向折下了腰，又抬起了頭，永遠做着那單調的動作，山樹如黛，刷拉刷拉地搖擺着肥胖的身體。</p>
<p>遠處村落都已安眠，在這原野的一角墓地是甦醒的時候到了。</p>
<p>其實說這是墓地，也祗是東一個土墩，西一土墩罷了；這是村裘的善心人對於橫七豎八無人過問的屍體的收斂。</p>
<p>睡在東南角的文老爹首先翻了個身，坐了起來，揉揉睡惺忪的眼。對四周巡視了一番。</p>
<p>『孩子們，月亮已升到頭頂上了，該起嘍！』這是微弱的聲音，可是已够響澈寂靜的黑夜。</p>
<p>一陣騷動，汪又新，劉福子，周大娘和陳老大都坐了起來，祗剩下董二和一個梳辮子的女孩還沉沉地睡着。</p>
<p>陳老大懶洋洋地斜倚着土墩，自言自語：『嗯，起來，起來……起來還不是睡着一樣？一點屁消息也還是沒有』。</p>
<p>大家呆呆地坐着，眼光沒目標地各自望着前方。聽得見的祗有間或的一兩聲嘆息。</p>
<p>文老爹點起了早烟袋，一邊說：『自從董二來了吿訴我們打了勝仗後已經整整半年，天天這麼起來睡下，離人世越來越遠了』。他深深吸了口烟，吐出一團白霧，『要是能有個消息知道家裏大小平安，知道人人都吃上了白米飯，那才能叫人放心啦！』</p>
<p>這話正提起了陳老大滿肚子的心事；『太平年月已經該是下，地插秧的時候了，誰知道現在過的是什麽倒霉日子！』</p>
<p>周大娘禁不住用衣襟抹了抹眼角。</p>
<p>汪又新却跳了起來：『話不是這麽說，陳老大！我們的　班長從前就常對我們說，堂堂男子漢吃點苦算不得什麽。大家全是爲了抗戰。苦　不是白吃的，你看現在還不是勝利了，咱們中國也到了翻身出頭的日子啦』！</p>
<p>說敎似的堅定口吻使大家都沉默無　。</p>
<p>兩隻老鴨找不着歸宿，在空中撲落撲落亂飛。哇哇叫了幾聲又掠了過去。</p>
<p>劉福子有聲無氣地哼着那長年不離嘴的歌：『我的家在東北松花江上，那輿有滿山遍野的大豆高梁……』</p>
<p>陳老火着惱了：『你倒是有完沒完？總是這個倒霉的歌！誰不知道你的家在松花江上？誰沒有家？這麼些年了，死的死。逃的逃，好好的人家拆得個七零八落，文老爹，你說你怎麽會餓倒在路旁？周大娘，你說你怎麽會被趕出家鄕？劉福子，汪又新，你們也說說怎麽會逼上戰塲？………』</p>
<p>汪又新不愛聽這套：『得啦！過去的事還提什麼？你聽見沒有，現在是抗戰勝利了，日本鬼子滾了蛋，咱們的爹娘老百姓再也用不着吃高梁葉，再也用不着給人做牛馬，往後好日子長着呢！苦頭不是白吃的，你懂不懂？』</p>
<p>『苦頭可眞吃怕了』，文老爹緩緩地說。『好日子快來啵』！</p>
<p>『常然會來！一定會來！』汪又新始終忠於信仰，拍拍胸脯向大家保證。</p>
<p>月光麗得更勻了，祇聽見山稽上的黑樹影刷拉刷拉作響。董二　得眞　，女孩子嘴裏嘟嘟噥噥，祗聽得出『媽呀，媽呀』。仍是沒醒。</p>
<p>劉福子東張西　，突然發現他左手不遠的地方雖着一個新夥伴。大家一陣驚喜，將他搖撼醒了！『喂，朋友，外邊有什麼消息，你怎麽會到這裏來的？』</p>
<p>新夥伴骨碌一下坐了起來：『我怎麽來的嗎？流彈送我來的！』</p>
<p>劉福子啐了他一口：『少跟人胡扯，鬼子早滾蛋了，誰請你吃流彈？』</p>
<p>新來的又覺得奇怪，怎麽砲火聲亂烘烘的，到這裏什麽也聽不見了。於是他詳細給大家叙述他所知道的情形。</p>
<p>風有些凉颼颼的，月亮不知躱到那裏去了，雲彩眞是變幻莫測，黑沉沉地似乎要墜下地來，荒野的一切都迸住呼吸在諦聽那忽悲忽怨的叙述。被挑逗的情感燃燒到高度時，祇顯得麻木。文老爹旱烟袋的紅光，一閃一閃映照出左近緊抓一把眉頭的表情。</p>
<p>說話的人用『這年頭人命不値錢，老百姓活該倒霉』！的話來結束他的報吿。沒有人敢相信他的話，可是也沒有人敢不相信他的話。被命運播弄慣了，誰也不能再寄托信任於自己的願望。</p>
<p>陳老大說：『那天才是出頭的日子呢？』</p>
<p>劉福子滿肚委屈：『我們吃苦究竟是岡個什麽』？</p>
<p>周大娘不住地擦着眼角。</p>
<p>文老爹搖頭嘆息：『老天眞沒長眼！』</p>
<p>在又新把頭埋在手裏，信仰幻滅了，一切都顯得空虛</p>
<p>痛苦湮沒了每顆心。</p>
<p>漸漸地，墓地又睡去了，可是惡夢甚至對於死人也不放鬆地纏擾着。</p>
<p>大地在私語，互相傳遞消息，表面仍是那麼安詳舒適。</p>
<h3 id="c131">山居閒情 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣星煜</p>
<p>一九四四年的暮秋，我從南溫泉移居到北溫泉去，秋天是霧季的序幕，整個的赤色盆地沉醉在乳漿般的迷濛情調裏，從北碚到溫泉的小船是像蟻羣般地密佈在嘉陵江上的，我們的船兒揚起小小的白帆，讓潤濕的秋風吹送着，沿着鬆軟的沙岸緩緩地上溯，起伏的峯巒欣迎我以葱鬱的錄色，而照映着起伏的峯　的江水正藍得發亮，藍得使我在心坎裏深深地覺得它的可愛；船兒進了大渡口，低沉的天空陡然顯得高了許多，最先吸引我的視綫的是溫泉寺的琉璃的瓦稜，和高大的紅牆虬曲的古古柏構成一幅古典的風景畫。</p>
<p>我需要在這靜悄悄的山國靜悄悄地休養一些時候，我在半山的一座別　裏住了下來，房子四圍有疏疏落落的竹籬環繞着，紫藤花雖然已經凋謝了，枯萎的藤依然緊緊地擁抱着籬笆，屋簷上偶然有三兩隻麻雀交換些短短的對話，倒把這寂寞的氣氛襯托得更加寂寞起來。</p>
<p>窗子裏望出去是一片衰敗的竹林，終年很少有人的脚跡，顯得荒凉而幽暗，地面上平舖着些薄薄的苔蘚，讓蝶螈和甲虫在上而舒適地漫步，當它們踏到落葉的角落，便有一陣輕微的　繂聲發出，竹林的盡處橫睡着一條廢棄的公路，如今只有趕市集的人走過，只有放牧的村童驅着牛羣和羊羣走過；再遠是綿亙無盡的茶褐色的山崗，一直伸展到遠方。</p>
<p>走出籬門，是一塊淺草茸茸的平壩，後來我常常在壩上打羽毛球，或是，作爲日光浴的浴塲。</p>
<p>生活是閒適的，每天早晨在左近散步的時候，偶而也採擷一些花束插在瓶裘面，用水養起來，整個的上午，我總是躺在躺椅上的，房子裘的光綫比較暗，因此躺椅就放在走廊裏，爲了要使身體寬舒，倒是穿睡衣的時候多，霧太濃重了，或是起了風，怕受凉，情願蓋上一床毛巾被；躺椅傍是一張放茶杯和書籍的矮几，書籍裏面少不了峨默的「魯拜集」，雖然這是我早已讀得能背誦的了，我對於龍井和「魯拜集」的愛好，幾乎陷入一種精神上的病態。</p>
<p>躺着仰望天空，使我有着置身海上的感覺，那灰沉沉的氣琉，不正像英倫海峽終年被白霧籠軍着的海水麽？</p>
<p>下雨的日子，報差和郵差都不上山來，這裏彷彿和整個世界完全隔絕了，只有淙淙的簷漏，像一個沒有人欣賞的歌手在彈奏單調的豎琴，接連下一兩個星期的雨是不希奇的，我始終沒有完成中國書學硏究會請我寫的那本業書，我計劃利用雨天來讀入川以後所收藏的碑帖，「蘭亭序」的惆悵的情緒使我不能安寗，只有站起來吸一兩筒板煙，妄想把感染來的一份惆悵，也隨着煙圈漸漸地淡化。</p>
<p>我久已忘記了用鐘的習慣，述案頭日曆也懶得翻了，　它被塵封着，被瓶花的殘骸覆蓋着，時節依然在無聲無息地轉換，等到我有一次從峽谷裏走過，看見臘梅開了幾株瘦小的花朶，才意識到原來已是歲暮了。</p>
<p>冬天的北泉公園是沒有喧囂的，愛蓮池裏　浮着一兩片枯殘的荷葉，隨着寒冷的波光輕輕地顫動，如今那些都市裏來的遊客早回到都市裏去了，就是修理花卉的工匠也總居在家裏休息了，只有我提着一根倒鈞藤的手杖，在這山風呼嘯着的歲暮，在這方石板的道路上踽踽獨行。</p>
<p>我的手杖很久很久就成爲身體的一部份了，在這崎嶇的山中，我一分鐘也不能離開它的，我沒有坐一次山轎的享受，我不願意讓那些比我更淸瘦更憔悴的轎夫，抬着我爬一個高峻的斜坡，重壓下的喘息，痛苦中的表情，魔術似地使我難以言喩地酸楚。</p>
<p>在溫泉寺到縉雲寺的中途，叢山環抱着一個小小的湖泊，我曾在微雪的淸晨去作初次巡禮，靜止的湖水綠得那麼深沉，湖畔的高大的杉樹白得那麽潔淨，長堤上排列着一抹青的欄　，彷彿這長堤的彼岸就是我們所祈求的天國；微雪仍舊怕人察覺似地落下來顯下來，而總　寺的鐘聲也隨着霉片疏疏地　落，在這一體間，我卑微的生命受到了一種感召，我愚昧的心靈受到了一種啓示，我願化身爲湖水的一點一滴，我願化身爲杉樹的一枝一葉，我願在　聲裏渡過未來的歲月。</p>
<p>漫長的冬夜，爐火是我最親切的友人，爐火的照耀，替我刻劃着過多的風霜底面孔敷上一層緋紅的色澤，一塊杠炭的燦裂，一顆火星的飛射，就是整個冬夜値得記叙的事情，我從沒有辜負過爐火的溫暖的賜予，坐在　邊，要等到每一塊杠炭都經過完全的燃燒，都變了熱力發散已盡的死灰，我才無可奈何地去睡眠。</p>
<p>蓋了厚被往往有夢，這在我是無法逃避的苦役，無論在夢境是歡悮是悲哀，醒來免不了空虛之感，那些天物，那些形象都很快地消失了，只有一片無邊際的黑暗，和黑暗中若有若無的陰影，夢是空虛的，無法把握住的，人之一生，也不過是一個冗長的夢罷！也不過些瑣碎的夢底連續罷！</p>
<p>春天逡巡在山中，我已經稔熟於每一條蹊徑每一個荒僻的所在了，我發現山背後那亂石堆裏密佈着墳墓，野薔薇開得正茂盛，香得使我簡直透不轉氣來，這是造物憐憫那些長眠在山野裏的精靈，而特意佈置得如此樸素如此美麗麼？翩翩而舞的小黃蝴蝶，是死者所蛻化的麼？墓地沒有一塊碑碣一掛紙錢，也許葬在這裏的都是些飄泊異鄕的旅人，其實碑碣和紙錢也是徒然的，不過是後死者在覓取一點極有限的自我慰　罷了。</p>
<p>有一些　　畫的機會便道　問我的來客，我並沒有熱烈地歡迎他　，　然他們　作出來的　離還相當富於　馴性，　可以作爲我寫　文的題材，但是道種訪問終究使我的精　萬分疲憊，對方要是沒有問句，我是一聲不警的，圈心地　着對方的乏味的獨白，每到吿一段落，我才據　地鼻子裏輕輕地哼一聲。</p>
<p>我的鄰居們倒是和和氣氣的，當我和他們有過幾次接觸以後，我被他們的眞　和熱忱深深地感動了，他們以皈依宗敎的虔敬來皈依藝術，修　是如此地深邃，技巧是如此地熟練，他們把自已的精力利腦汁凝聚在調色板上，凝聚在畫筆的尖端上，凝聚在賓布上。他們在這一切的生命都在充溢着活力開始躍動的春天，從早晨到黃昏，受了催眠似在山野裏寫生。在雨天和夜晚，我做過幾次模特兒，這也是一種新奇的生活經騐，可是時間一延長，面部的表情總不免變得死板，而民全身的肌肉彷彿逐漸地總緊起來，我最怕頑皮的小孩子故意逗着我笑，我認爲一個優秀的模特兒的養成是頗不容易的。</p>
<p>山國的初夏不比江南，喝一杯淸沏的龍井就使我滿頭汗水了，北溫泉游泳池的窄狹和擁擠使我失去了興趣，我總是上半山裏的湖泊去，杉樹林裏掛起白的褥單，地上舖一床毛巾毯子，泳得乏力就躺一會兒，聽聽濃　裏知了的唱歌，吃半聽罐頭的水菓　有時候農夫也來洗浴，在這裏一切都像慮騷所願望回到自然了，人脫去衣服，呈現出本來的肉體，在這裏沒貧富的劃分，沒有階級的畛域，只有健康和衰弱的比較在這裏一切都是公允的。</p>
<p>我常常參觀育才學校的舞踊表現會，「靑春舞曲」從不例外地使每一個觀衆瘋狂地歡呼，道舞曲抒情地表現了新疆繼回的生活，訴說了這一代大草原上的少女們的靑春底哀怨，「靑春舞曲」所給予我的美感，也就是舞踊藝術所可能給予我的最高度底美感。</p>
<p>當東山坪的西瓜長得大又甜的時候，學圃農塲的主人來請我替他做品味的工作，我被作爲機械似地一一嘗試不同的種子不同的熟度底西瓜，幾乎把味覺弄得麻木了；我很羨慕農塲技術員的生活，他們夜裏就睡茅草棚，輪流地執着鋼又出來巡邏，防禦竊賊和偸吃西瓜的猪貛，他們聽見輕微的一聲嗥叫就能辯別是什麼默類，看了星斗的方位就能判斷是什麽時辰。</p>

<p>「誰知一落地，是個小子，那就是我。」他偏過頭來，瞧着我一嘴牙笑了，「媽倒是喜歡，爺爺可棚起臉，駡我臭小子，又說沒出息。媽知道這都是假話：爺爺可眞賣力，一落地直到三周月，前藥水給我洗，從頭頂到脚心，揑筋骨，滾藥包哪，什麽的，忙個不停。後來才讓媽自己辦，他老人家還不放心，必得自己在一邊瞧着。」</p>
<p>「怪得你長得這麼棒」。我細細地瞧了他的手臂和小腿，雖看不見肌肉凸出來，却圓滾滾地，好像綳緊的車胎，緊得放光。「倒沒甚麽」；他自己也瞧了瞧自己的小手膊，「祗不怕冷，不怕熱，—敲在身上，不管使什麼，不大怕疼」。</p>
<p>「大概都是你爺爺一人教你練功」？</p>
<p>「不，爺爺祗敎氣功，還有好幾個師父哪」。</p>
<p>「可去報了仇」？</p>
<p>「報不了哪……他家都死絕哪，祇　下幾個娘兒們，也沒練功；爺爺也不讓去，大伯也不贊成—咱們家早挪到寨子裏去了—大伯敎我練馬，練槍，他說打鬼子就算報仇」。</p>
<p>這時，日頭沒多高了，大概我們也走了不差十多里地，正想找個地方歇歇脚再走，却看不見一個適當的地點。</p>
<p>「前邊可有什麼茶棚子嗎」？我們走過的都是小山埂子，田埂子，看不見一個人影，祇好找着我這位小響導，幾條小路，他都跑過。</p>
<p>「您想打尖」？他又把那個小布袋舉了起來。「這裏邊有饝，有蛋糕」。</p>
<p>「不想吃，祇想歇一會再走」。瞧他把口袋已經拉開了，知道他想吃，便叫他邊走邊吃。</p>
<p>「我也不餓」，雖是這麼說着，可已經嚥了兩次水了，「這兒可不好坐，過了這個小土包，記得好像有個小寨子似的」。他指了指橫在我們前面的一座小土山；他說慣了寨子，大概祇是一個小村落。</p>
<p>約莫又走了半小時左右，已經快到小山頂，正打算要在山項瞧瞧四周，沒防着，驀地聽見一聲吆喝，很粗的一個沙嗓子，是日本口音。抬頭一瞧，見山頭上，不知甚麼時候，跑來了兩個日本兵，正端着槍，槍口對準了我們。</p>
<p>這突如其來的一個岔子，常然叫我們吃了一驚。我們祇得停了步，呆了一呆。剛想吿訴他們兩句話，只見一個兵打着手勢，叫我們退走，另一個兵却駡着他的伙伴是傻瓜，應該俘擄我們，至少要搜査一下。碰碰財運。</p>
<p>小老虎倒是滿不在乎的神情，只瞧着我；大圓眼圈露出了一絲笑意。</p>
<p>「弟兄們，我們是有命令辦公事的」，我很客氣的對那兩個傢伙說，一面朝他們走着。</p>
<p>「什麽公事，那裏的命令」？那位去碰碰財運的問着，收起了剛才那副猙獰的樣子。</p>
<p>「我說公事，當然就是公事，你們長官在這裏嗎」？我已經走到了他們面前，小老虎也跟在我身邊。</p>
<p>「畏官就在道裏」，客氣起來了，大概認爲我是他們的貴同胞，也許我的日本語音和高級長官的口氣，把他們給攝伏住了。</p>
<p>我順着那位財迷傢伙的槍尖向北面山脚瞧去，不禁有些忐忑起來，倒不是害怕，祇是奇怪他們怎麽來得如此神速；因爲瞧瞧這一帶的佈置，照軍事眼光看，大槪整個北平，都在日軍包圍之中了。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>獲得「威爾基犬下一家飛行獎」的第一人美廣播記者諾門考溫，昨天到了上海，在記者招待會上，大談其天下一家的理想。</p>
<p>他說：韋勃司脫字典上「外交」一詞的解釋爲「以技巧獲得利益而不招致惡意及戰爭」；他說：新的定義應改爲「以技巧樹立國家的信譽」。</p>
<p>威爾基是一個具有崇高理想的人，他有遠見，不幸一九四一年他競選失敗，更不幸訪問中國返美後即病逝。（許多人都說中國似乎是個魔窟，誰種着手誰就沾點晦氣，威爾基來了回去便一命嗚呼，華萊士來了，回去連副總統也選洛，赫爾利，魏德邁，陳納德，無一不多多少少觸點霉頭，即運現在的馬歇爾司徒雷登也還在傷腦筋當中）。</p>
<p>大下一家的思想，其實我們　　　久了，明天我們紀念的孔子就是它的創造者，禮運大同篇，不是說得很具體　　澈嗎？而國父孫中山先生的三民主義也就是承繼着這種哲學體系的。今日，西方的耶敎精神和東方的儒家精神，可以說是同一思想系統。</p>
<p>人類爲什麼要鈎心鬥角厮殺火併，無論是爲了獲得利益或獲得信譽，都不能成爲相爭相伐的理由。人類眞正所尋求的技巧，應在謀取每個人的豐衣足食安居樂業；所祟奉的信條，應爲「與其一身足不如家人足。這就是如華萊士所曾經說過的「世界上每個人每天須能享受幾奈特的牛奶」這一簡單道理。</p>
<p>放眼現實，我們將驚心怵目於所謂生存競爭之人類活動的緊張劇烈，神經衰弱之餘，有幾個人在午夜夢迴時分想到自己的愚騃和荒誕哩！</p>

<p>外匯放長後</p>
<p>外匯放長的後一日，吳市長召集各同業公會舉行會議：要穩定物價。對四大公司及百貨業要求不漲價，所予的極大帮助，就是取締攤販。略謂：「……現在上海之攤販，大部均販售洋貨，有資本在數千萬元以上者。此畸形狀態，影響所及，百貨業固蒙損害，政府亦因其逃避稅收而有損失，……故市府已下令除吃食小攤販外，其餘無論五洋雜貨攤販，一律取締，限八月底前禁絕，……」</p>
<p>的確，勝利後洋貨潮湧地進口，生意經也畸形起來；像這種行將禁絕的活動攤販就是一種。而不在禁例之內的吃食攤販將與時俱增，蓬勃的在生長起來了！</p>
<p>君不見，夕陽西下，多少街道旁架起臼布逢的咖啡攤正在爲你設座！</p>
<p>要是你晚一點出去，那才够味—白的桌布，白的櫈套，在光亮的電燈下面反映得更加潔白；桌回上順次闔着玻琍的飲具，中間整齊地排列着Hills　Bros的咖啡，沙利文的麪包，菊花牌的牛奶。取價非常便宜，不像咖啡館裏飲一杯咖啡要一聽的價錢，它只要你幾百元錢，而且還可以都調點牛奶。在遠遠地望去，正疑置身在南國，以爲不是到了菲律　。一定是在馬蘭亞或是爪哇了；其實不然，這是咖啡土司的平民化。這可以使一個小公務員也有能力嘗嗜上品咖啡的滋味，了却白塔土司的心願！</p>
<p>賣玻琍褲帶的人，一定在怨恨外匯放長而把他的飯碗敲破了；燒咖啡冲牛奶的，一定在慶賀他們賣買還好不在禁例之內。眞是，這回外匯的變動引起了多少『幾家歡笑幾家愁』的情境。但是，一個人在患難的時候，才是他天才表現的好機會，所以，我相信，賣玻琍褲帶的人腦筋動得比我快，他將儘速地脫貨求現，準備改籌一個咖啡攤舖，來維持他的生活。</p>
<p>咖啡的傾銷又該走上競爭的命運了，這對我們平民的口福是不淺的；我感謝外匯的放長！</p>

<p>— 科學常識</p>
<p>不久以前，報上登載這麽一條小新聞，說滬市衛生當局抽騐食物，結果發見某一家頗有名的醬油，完全不過是「　色」和鹽水的混合。所謂「醬色」，我們曉得，實際上就是用豆麩榖糠之類釀成的混色劑，無任何養分。若用科學的方法來製造，「　色」可以不帶任何氣味，用水　釋它，就有和醬油一樣顏色。不過其味則與白開水無異。</p>
<p>在這裏，筆者並不想特別指責這種不良商人，消費的顧客也應負一部分的責任。</p>
<p>外國有句諺語，說「九角九分錢買個瓶子」，意思說，顧客化了一塊錢買回的商品，有九角九分錢化在瓶子上的商標，裝璜，和廣吿之上，而需用的東西。裝在瓶子裏的僅値一分錢而已。這是極普遍的消費心理，而消費者大多數亦甘心如此浪費。</p>
<p>用煮得爛熟的薯加上紅色頗料和糖醋之類，老實的商人若然老實地稱呼它做「甜薯醬」，在市塲上定必無人過問，滑頭的製造家用相同的材料，製好封進玻璃瓶子裏，黏上一張三色版精印的商標紙，堂堂正正繪上兩三隻紅滴滴的番茄子，於是乎就可以名正言順的說是Tomato　Sauce了。像這樣的例子，多得很多得很。近一二十年，因爲有機化學之長足進步，許多許多吃下肚子裏沒有毒的顏料，先後發明，允爲助長了這一方面的欺騙取巧。</p>
<p>當然囉，外國也有「臭虫」呢。在這裏我可以舉出一個極端的例。</p>
<p>美國有一家很有名的罐頭食品廠，出品有葡萄汁，照它罐上所說，加水八倍，其味與新鮮的葡萄汁無異。我把那鐵罐戳個洞，倒出來的正像紫色墨水一樣的液體，其中分明是用有機顏料「甲垸紫」（Methyl　Violet）染了色。我用極簡單的化學方法證明猜的並沒有錯，而這紫色的顏料和我們所用的「拷貝鉛筆」，紫色複寫紙，紫色打印墨水所用的顏料，完全相同。豈祗吃顏料。後來我又想一想，才知道這是一件够滑稽的事：因爲新鮮的紫葡萄，不過是表皮紫色，裏面的果汁，並不帶有半點紫色，榨壓出來的葡萄汁，也本該是無色，那裏會顏色濃得像打印紫墨水？—想到這裏，我的味覺就减退了一半！</p>
<p>滑稽的事情還多呢。想來大家都曉得，甜食中常有人用「糖精」以代替白糖。「糖精」也是一種有機化合物，白色晶狀小顆，味帶苦，但混入大量的水裏稀釋以後，則有强力的甜糖味，許多人相信吃它下去有害肚子，事實上科學早已證明：糖精在肚子裏不過「旅行」一次，於人無益無害，腸胃不吸收它，所以早晚必「原封不動」的排便出來。這並不是瞎說：假如需要的話，化學家可以用並不困難的手續，把你昨天吃下去的糖精從排便物中找回來，經過口腔，再去肚子裏旅行無限次！每次還是同樣的「甜」！……</p>
<p>吃顏料，吃肚子裏不吸收的糖，對於這些荒唐的吃法，我們似乎僅可以道麼「解嘲」：吃是一種享樂，包括舌頭的和眼睛的。「眼睛吃冰淇淋」這句話，是有根據的。多少怨枉錢化在吃不得的「食物」之上呢！</p>

<p>— 方山</p>
<p>要改進目下上海的敎育，我想在這裏大瞻地貢獻一個辦法：把上海的學校大量移到上海四郊的鄕間去。</p>
<p>這理由很簡單，也定然會爲人所首肯的。</p>
<p>先說消極方面的理山。上海，道一個人口擁擠的都市，這一個淫靡的都市，總不能說是最好的敎育環境。由於人口擁擠，上海變成了一個寸金之地，縱令學校的主持者確是一個有素養·有理想·有純潔意志·有辦學熱情·決定以畢生精力盡瘁於敎育第二代事業的眞正敎育家，但這種的學校，這樣的敎育家，也依然不會有辦法我到合乎理想的校舍的。這也是上海學校多數成爲「弄堂學校」·「馬路學校」的原因所在。在這樣的校舍中，學生的呼吸，必須和汚濁的沉悶的空氣掙扎，學生的目力，必須和黯澹的至少是不足的光綫奮鬥；學生的聽覺，必須和街上的電車聲以及叫賣聲等騷音抵抗。事實上，許多學生，都逃不了爲肺結核。近視眼。歇斯的里患者的命運。至於淫靡之風的普遍存在，又鮮能不使模仿性和感受性特强的兒童和靑年，於耳濡目染之餘，免却同流合汚的後果。</p>
<p>再說積極方面的理由。上海四郊的鄕間，有着遼廣的空間，有着新鮮的空氣，有着綺麗的自然景物，有着淳樸的民情風俗。這一些，都說明了環境的優良，足爲陶養性情，鍜鍊體格和研究學問的理想場所。</p>
<p>根據上述兩方面的理由，我敢於向敎育家們大聲疾呼：不要再在上海市街圈內打圈子了。我們要到上海的郊區去開發敎育的園地；同時，我敢於向學生的家長們大聲疾呼：孟母擇隣是一種賢明的措施，我們要把子弟送到上海市郊去就學。</p>
<p>這在敎育家，是一種創造力的試金石；在學生家長，是一種辨別力的測量表。但學生家長的辨別力，還得由敎育家的創造力來啓發。所以敎育家的創造力，應當是「學校下鄉去」運動的推動力。</p>
<p>在上海許多學校的招生廣吿中，我發現了新創辦的華東職業學校的廣吿。聽說該校一切設備，都是繼承自前華東聯合中學的。該校爲趙傳家，陳天愚諸先生所創辦，校址設於上海西郊的眞如的鄕間，有目建的校舍，可爲最近上海學校下鄕運動的先驅。</p>
<p>筆者於此就福學校下鄉運動開展！</p>

<p>— 重征</p>
<p>兩個意見：（一）郁香巖應該挺　身而出；（二）希望聽到下文！</p>
<p>路局舞弊的『法定主角』，當然是張鴻圖處長，可是張處長把舞弊的嫌疑。一起推在太太郁香巖身上。郁香最又査如黃鶴，無從價緝。在郁氏歸案之前，這一件舉國矚目的舞弊案，一時無從大白。</p>
<p>我想郁香巖雖然貴爲處長太太，究竟不能在路局方面，藉權勢米大展鴻圖，他憑藉什麽幹出這龐大數字的舞弊案來？不免令人懷疑。</p>
<p>假使我是郁香巖的話，無論寃枉不寃枉，一定要挺身而出；如果張先生的口供是事實，那末一人做事一人當，連累旁人，連累丈夫，在良心過不去，在法律上也不容你逍遙的；倘然是張處長誣衊了你，或者便逃亡，替他消消災，做做傀儡，那末不但毁滅了一已的聲譽，連整個婦女界也被你沾活了！</p>
<p>我們婦女界，在幾千年對封建時代的　　過　中，到提　女權的今日，還是除不盡遺毒，袪不盡障碍；假使再戴上一個做官沒份，舞弊是主角的頭銜，實在心有未甘—（金經）</p>
<p>常常感覺什麽事總是虎頭蛇尾。譬如「八一三」滬戰時大家情緒多麽熱烈，尤其是死守四行倉庫的孤軍八百壯士民族英雄謝團長，當時大家都歌頌他，而現在他的遺孤嗷嗷待哺，却無人過問。</p>
<p>轟動全滬的兩路局一萬萬餘元的大舞弊案，爲時已月餘，而今下文缺缺。記得剛剛發生時，衆八氣憤不平，一致認爲應予嚴辦。而且我們的當局也決不忽視。</p>
<p>該案審訊現在究竟怎樣，雖有其固定的法律程序，我們不便越權干涉，但總希望在有意無意的拖延中，而大事化小，小事化無。但願不要使三百五十萬市民失望！</p>
<p>記得在兩路局舞弊案之後，廣九鐵路也同樣的發生了一萬萬元的舞弊案，現在也依舊是未見下文。難這是無獨有偶？在道裏，我們只是希望快辦，認眞的辦！</p>

<p>— 桂庭</p>
<p>—南斯拉夫的獨裁者　（上）</p>
<p>南美交惡聲中，南斯拉天的獨裁者—狄托，遂成爲舉世矚目的國際人物。叫瞭他的來歷，他的背景，才能了解南斯拉夫何以會悍然挑動這次軒然巨波。美國陸軍少校　爾汀（Malor　Temple　H．Fielding）在戰時曾經隨同美國軍事使節團駐在南斯拉夫，逗留了幾個月，和狄托及其部屬來往甚密。下面便是他對狄托的一切所寫的報導：</p>
<p>狄托是南斯拉夫的元帥，民族解放軍的最高指揮官，及共產黨的書記長。他是巴爾幹人物中最當有動力的一個。在外表方面，他一言一笑，都非常富於誘惑性。在待人接物當中，無時不充分表現着其個性的吸引力。</p>
<p>他的樣子簡直是一個大學敎授的派頭。身材矮而肥，肌肉飽滿，今年五十三歲，談吐溫柔，舉止頗有學者風度。一雙碧綠的眼睛，蓬亂的頭髮，照美國人的一眼光看來，他時常都需要理髮的。</p>
<p>報紙上所發表的照片看來，狄托似乎是一個非常嚴肅的人物。可是實際上，他笑的時候却比縐眉頭的時候多。他喜歡談天，談吐極共幽默。有一次，費爾汀和他進膳的時候，因爲椅子坐不好的綠故，跌了一交。狄托居然捧腹大笑。他那副樣子簡直與米老鼠無異！</p>
<p>狄托穿的制服相當整潔，但並不太誇張。左胸上掛着狄托自已授給狄托的游擊隊勳章，右胸上掛着蘇聯蘇伏洛夫的銀星動章。終日跟隨着他的是一班衛隊和一個女通譯奧爾加（Oga　Ninchitch　Humo）。狄托的第二個妻子，赫爾泰（Herta）。是一個斯洛伐的村婦，並不和他住在行營裏。</p>
<p>不喜欢用英语</p>
<p>狄托有着一個古怪的脾氣，就是對於英语表示冷淡的態度。他本人懂得四五種外國文字，但他的英文也是不退板的。他的演說並不十分出色，音調平和，時常運用鼻音。但是他的個人的誘惑性却把這些缺點掩蓋了。所以，他一開口，聽衆就歇私的里亞地被他說服了。</p>
<p>講到他的身世及戰前的活動，下面便是的略的顚末：狄托誕生於哥羅西亞。父親是一個鐵匠，母親是一個農婦，兩個都是文盲。一九一四年，狄托被徵參　奧匃軍隊。但他臨陣時就投降於俄軍。後來因爲反對爲沙皇作戰，被發配於西伯利亞。布爾扎維克黨獲得政權後，於一九一七年把他釋放。他於是參加了共產黨。她在大革命的漩渦中薰陶了三年。一九二〇年至一九二三年間，被遺於莫斯科的秘密訓練學校。在那裏，外國的共產黨是受着嚴格的訓練，以岡推翻他們的資本主義政府。二十八歲的那年，他已經成爲一員堅强的嚴守紀律的共產黨黨徒，然後派返哥羅西亞去。當時祖任五金工會的領袖，並且大肆活動。結果被捕入獄。五年後才釋放出來。他經過此番遭遇後，他的態度更加堅强起來，同時感覺到：他的仇敵必須無憐憫地加以芟除。此後，就從事地下工作，成爲一個共產黨的活動幹員。</p>
<p>共產黨的要人</p>
<p>其後十三年間，狄托似乎完全寂然無聞了。有些方面的報吿說他曾經担任第三國際的活動幹員，而且是斯達林派遺於巴爾幹的最高代表。但後來，這報吿是被否認了。熟悉此中情形的觀察家以爲此一否認是正確的，因爲蘇維埃的軍事情報機關是一個完全獨立的間諜組織，而且保守秘密到連第三國際都不甚知道它的活動。當然，狄托是一個重要的共產黨幹部人員，他在正統派方面是寂寂無名的，並且他也曾替蘇聯當間諜。他承認在一九二九年至一九三九年間曾經秘密潛返蘇聯數次。</p>
<p>希特拉於一九四一年四月六日進攻南斯拉夫。數百單位的抗戰團體一致羣起抵抗。但狄托及共產黨黨員並未荷槍實彈，參加抗戰。兩個月之後，德國於同日進攻蘇聯後，他們的游擊隊才開始作戰。狄托後來解釋這種延遲是爲了技術的便利的綠故，同時他還辯稱到那時候，他的人馬才完全組織起來。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 25th Dispatch] General Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, hosted a reception for reporters at Jinshuo Villa on the 25th, announcing the results of the military trial of the Wen Yiduo assassination case and the measures taken against Garrison Commander Huo Kuizhang, among others. Gu stated: "Since arriving in Kunming, I immediately ordered the Garrison Headquarters, military police, and police to solve the case within a set time. I also consulted with respected elders and people from all walks of life in Kunming to find the real culprit. Through the efforts of the Garrison Headquarters, Military Police Commander Zhang, and Police Commissioner Tang, along with the cooperation of various parties, and after multiple thorough investigations, the perpetrators of the Wen case were finally apprehended. The perpetrators were found to be active-duty soldiers, and according to the law, they should be subject to military trial on the spot. For the sake of seriousness, I specifically ordered the Army Headquarters Military Law Department, the Yunnan Provincial Security Command, and the Kunming-based military police to form a joint military trial court for a public trial, and invited representatives from all walks of life to observe. Mr. Liang Shuming and Mr. Zhou Xinmin from the Democratic League also participated, which shows that there was absolutely no concealment in this case. At the conclusion of the trial, the presiding judge and judges believed that the perpetrators, as active-duty officers, dared to kill with firearms while on duty. Although it was motivated by righteous indignation due to Wen Yiduo's insults and criticisms of the government and disparagement of the military, they ultimately disregarded the law and should be sentenced to the ultimate penalty. I believe this judgment is appropriate and, after submitting it for approval, immediately ordered its execution. Regarding this case, I deeply regret the loss of Professor Wen Yiduo to the academic community. I also feel a sense of sorrow for the perpetrators, Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan, who violated the law and received the ultimate penalty. In addition to enforcing national laws, I sincerely hope that people across the country will not lightly denigrate the nation, which is being rebuilt with great difficulty, and give due respect to the soldiers who fought bloody battles during the War of Resistance. I especially hope that all my comrades will strictly abide by national laws and military discipline, understand propriety, and uphold righteousness, to complete the great task of national reconstruction with the spirit of the War of Resistance." In response to reporters' questions, Gu stated: "In Kunming, between the 11th and 15th of last month, two assassinations occurred consecutively. The Yunnan Garrison Headquarters should bear the responsibility for local security, and the assassins of Wen Yiduo were all officers of the Garrison Headquarters' special service battalion, making Commander Huo's responsibility even greater. Chairman Chiang was extremely angry about this and ordered the dismissal of Commander Huo, placing him under the supervision of the Army Headquarters. He Shaozhou has been appointed as the Commander of the Yunnan Garrison, Wang Lingyun as the Deputy Commander, and Ma Ying as the Chief of Staff." Gu concluded: "This case could have been announced earlier, but it was intended to be announced together after the Li Gongpu case was solved. The perpetrators of the Li case have not yet been apprehended, and we are strictly ordering the intensification of the search, and we hope to solve the case soon."</p>

The Army Headquarters' Thirty-Fifth Year Legal Review Character Yuan Number, Defendants: Tang Shiliang, male, 28 years old, from Hengyang, Hunan, Captain of the 3rd Company of the Special Service Battalion of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters; Li Wenshan, male, 32 years old, from Huangpi, Hubei, Lieutenant Platoon Leader of the 3rd Company of the Special Service Battalion of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters; Xu Zhankun, at large. The above-named defendants were tried by this headquarters for the crime of murder, and the judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>(Main Text) Tang Shiliang is sentenced to death for joint murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. He is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for attempted escape, to be executed concurrently with the death penalty, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Li Wenshan is sentenced to death for joint murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. One pistol and twenty-seven bullets belonging to Tang Shiliang are confiscated.</p>
<p>(Facts) The defendant Tang Shiliang is the Company Commander of the 3rd Company of the Special Service Battalion of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters, and Li Wenshan is the Platoon Leader of the same company. After the murder of Li Gongpu in Kunming on July 11th of this year, the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters strictly ordered its subordinates to investigate the perpetrators. Battalion Commander Tai Fugang convened a battalion affairs meeting, instructing each company to take turns being responsible for the security of the surrounding areas and secretly investigate the situation in the city. On the 15th of the same month, it was the company's turn to be on external duty. The defendants, each carrying a pistol, accompanied by the fugitive defendant Xu Zhankun, went out at approximately 11:00 am that day. They walked near the National Yunnan University and, because the university was holding a memorial service for Li Gongpu, the defendants entered to investigate. The victim, Wen Yiduo, was giving a speech, denouncing the government and insulting the military. Upon hearing the aforementioned speech, the defendants, filled with anger, immediately conceived a murderous intent. At the time, because there were many people in the venue, it was inconvenient to act. After the victim finished speaking and the meeting dispersed, the defendants followed him, eventually reaching a secluded place near Xicangpo, where they jointly opened fire and shot the victim, Wen Yiduo, who fell to the ground and died. His son, Lihe, who was walking with his father, saw his father fall and immediately prostrated himself on his father's body, also being hit by five bullets, but fortunately not fatally. Afterwards, Tang Shiliang and Xu Zhankun fled in fear of punishment. After being discovered by the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters, Li Wenshan was detained. Subsequently, Battalion Commander Tai also arrested Tang Shiliang and sent him to the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters to be jointly handed over to this headquarters for interrogation. The defendants Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan both confessed to the aforementioned facts. These confessions matched the time, location, and shooting circumstances described by Wen Lihe, as well as the clothing worn by the defendants. Moreover, Tang Shiliang fled in fear of punishment after the incident and was later arrested by Battalion Commander Tai Fugang in Yiliang. The pistol and bullets used in the murder were also recovered. The evidence is conclusive. After listening to Wen Yiduo's speech, the defendants followed him to several locations and shot and killed Wen Yiduo, and wounded Wen Lihe with a gunshot. They should be held accountable for joint murder and attempted murder. However, the defendants killed Wen Lihe out of a zeal to protect his father and in the process of not being able to differentiate and clearly determine that, and this is a single act that entails multiple crimes, and each should be punished for the most serious crime. The defendants were active-duty officers who dared to kill with firearms in broad daylight in the urban area of Kunming while on duty. This is a disregard for the law and the crime is unforgivable. Each should be given the ultimate penalty. As for Tang Shiliang's escape, he was arrested within only three days, not reaching the legally prescribed time limit, so he should be considered an attempted escape. The pistol and twenty-seven bullets used in the murder are confiscated. The pistol used by Li Wenshan is public property and should be returned to the original agency. Based on the above conclusions, except for Xu Zhankun, whose case will be handled separately after he is apprehended, in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2, Article 93, Paragraph 3, and Article 98 (attempted escape) of the Army and Air Force Criminal Law; Article 271, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2, Article 25, Article 26 (murder and attempted murder), Article 28 (joint crime), Article 55 (punishment for the most serious crime), Article 37, Paragraph 1 (deprivation of civil rights), Article 38, Paragraph 1, Item 2 (confiscation of firearms and bullets), and Article 51, Paragraph 2 (concurrent punishment for two crimes); Article 2, Paragraph 1, and Article 8 of the Wartime Navy, Army, and Air Force Summary Trial Regulations; and Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. Presiding Judge Zhang Xiaoqian (seal), Judge Yang Zhigou (seal), Judge Zhang Zhengdong (seal), Clerks Liu Heguang (seal), Xiong Shangde (seal), Republic of China, August 15, 35th Year.</p>

I immediately forwarded the case to Zhang Xiaoqian, Deputy Director of the Military Law Department of this headquarters, for investigation and handling. This officer conducted court hearings twice on August 12th and 13th, and questioned Wen Lihe, son of Wen Yiduo, and Wen's wife, Gao Xiaozhen, and summoned the local Baojia chiefs, considering that Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan were indeed suspected of the crime. He signed a request to organize a joint military trial court. I appointed Zhang Xiaoqian, Deputy Director of the Military Law Department of this headquarters, as the Presiding Judge, and the Yunnan Provincial Security Command and the Kunming-based 13th Regiment of the Military Police each sent military law officers to form a joint court. The court was opened on August 15th at the Kunming District Court. At the same time, the Military Law Department of this headquarters sent letters to various central and local agencies in Kunming, various levels of public opinion organs, legal entities, and news reporters in Yunnan Province, as well as Mr. Liang Shuming, to attend the trial as observers. The trial concluded on the same day, and the judgment was made in accordance with the law and recorded in the files. As for the suspect Yang Lide, arrested by the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters on August 19th, it was found that he was unrelated to this case and was ordered to be released on bail. Another suspect, Li Chengye, arrested on July 21st, denied being the perpetrator of the murder of Li Gongpu and was ordered to remain in custody for further interrogation. Furthermore, all military, government, constitution and police agencies in Yunnan were instructed to continue to search for the real perpetrator to ensure the case is solved. I hereby submit two volumes of files and one original judgment of the Wen Yiduo case for your review and compliance."</p>

<h3 id="e6">Minister Bai Receives Reporters, Hopes to Raise Alertness Regarding the Current Situation, and Discusses the Importance of National Defense Education <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guling, 25th Dispatch] When Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense received reporters at 8:30 pm on the 25th, a reporter asked whether the organization of the Ministry of National Defense had been completed. He replied that it was generally in place, but the organization of the Army Headquarters had not yet been completed. A reporter asked what threat the Communist army's attack on Datong posed. He replied that it was inconvenient to answer this question, but added that the current situation was not about the gain or loss of one city or one place. A reporter also asked about the Communist army's counterattack on Rugao in northern Jiangsu. Bai said: "The situation in northern Jiangsu can be clarified in the short term, but please increase your awareness." It is generally believed that, given the current situation, nothing is more urgent than national defense. After the reception, the reporters were invited to view military education films.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 25th Dispatch] Minister Bai held a tea party with reporters at Guling at 8:00 pm on the 25th and viewed military films. Bai briefly discussed his views on the issue of popularizing national defense education through movies, pointing out that modern national defense is universal and comprehensive, and also scientific and technological. He stated that since the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, he has felt the importance of national defense education in the future, and in order to achieve the goal of universality and depth, many new plans and facilities have been decided for using movies as a teaching tool. The original China Film Studio is also being reorganized into a purely military education film institution. At the same time, our target will not be limited to the troops, because the scope of national defense education is not only the use of a certain type of weapon, but must enable every soldier defending the territory to have all the basic scientific knowledge. We will try our best to use movies to spread this knowledge. We are prepared to make all films of this type available to the people of the country, because only when everyone has sufficient scientific knowledge can the country's prosperity and health be promoted. After Minister Bai concluded his speech on popularizing electric national defense education, reporters wanted to know from Mr. Bai how the current situation would be affected after the Communist Party issued a mobilization order. Bai avoided answering and only said: "Everyone should trust that national defense has absolute certainty of protecting the safety of the people and maintaining local tranquility." Asked what his opinion was on the Communist Party's use of poison gas to create disturbances, he replied, "China did not use poison gas to resist Japanese aggression. Even if the Communist Party uses poison gas to rebel, I dare to guarantee that the government will never use poison gas." Asked whether he had met with Marshal Ma since coming here, he replied that he only met with Marshal Ma in Nanjing, focusing on how to complete the modern national defense system.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] There will be significant reforms to our nation's military service system. It is rumored that the country will be divided into sixty-four garrison districts, with each garrison district (approximately 7.5 million people) governing one hundred and ninety-nine regimental districts (Shanghai will also have one regimental district). The list of commanders will be announced soon, and the selection is extremely cautious, based on the principle of employing younger locals. Conducting military service in one's hometown can fully unleash patriotism and love for one's home, and avoid situations where one cannot face one's elders. Under the new system, the powers of the commander will be greater than in the past, and the matters they handle will be more numerous and important than in the past. All unreasonable conscription abuses of the past will be eliminated under the new system.</p>

<p>Q: After the State Socialist Party and the Democratic Party fully formed the Democratic Socialist Party, I wonder what the differences are between the basic concepts of the new party and the original State Socialist Party. What is the relationship between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Democratic League?</p>
<p>Sun Baoyi replied: The Democratic Socialist Party's program will be published soon, which can be used to explain. As for the relationship with the Democratic League, it is currently still a member of the Democratic League, but any announcements made by the Democratic League to the outside world must first obtain the consent of our party.</p>
<p>Q: It is rumored that Mr. Zhang Dongsun will continue to engage in education work, taking a passive attitude and unwilling to face real politics. I wonder if there has been any such statement?</p>
<p>Zhang Dongsun replied: I took a one-year leave of absence from Yenching University in Chongqing last year. Recently, Yenching University resumed classes, and I still hope to return to work at the school. This trip to Shanghai was to explain this intention to the leaders of the Democratic League. I cannot take full responsibility for the work of the Democratic League in Beiping. I hope to send someone else to preside over it. As for whether to participate in real political work, I have never considered it, because the reorganization of the government is probably still a long way off. After Mr. Zhang finished speaking, Luo Longji specifically explained that Mr. Zhang Dongsun's education did not break away from the Democratic League.</p>
<p>Q: What is the relationship between the Democratic League as a whole and its constituent members?</p>
<p>Luo Longji replied: Although the Democratic League is a political group, there are no strict constraints between its whole and its constituent members. It cannot be compared with the Nationalist and Communist parties. At the same time, this is an internal matter of the Democratic League and does not need to be explained to the outside world, so there is no need to answer (Mr. Luo's emotions were agitated when answering this question, and he seemed unhappy.)</p>
<p>Q: Liang Shuming has always advocated rural autonomy. I wonder if he continued to work during the Anti-Japanese War? It is rumored that Mr. Liang has taken a passive attitude after the Political Consultative Conference, expressing his unwillingness to participate in real politics. Is this true? From the perspective of the rural governance movement, what criticisms does Mr. Liang have of the work done by the Chinese Communist Party in the countryside?</p>
<p>Liang Shuming replied: (1) During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the special circumstances, the work of promoting rural governance could not be continued; (2) After the Political Consultative Conference, I published an article in the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao on February 2, "Eight Years of Efforts Declared Over," stating my attitude and unwillingness to participate in real politics; (3) There are indeed great differences between the rural governance movement and the CCP's land policy.</p>
<p>Q: The so-called "Democratic Northeast Provisional Supreme Administrative Organization" was recently established in Harbin. I heard that Zhou Jingwen of the Democratic League also participated in it. Is this representing the Democratic League?</p>
<p>Luo Longji replied: Zhou Jingwen is indeed a member of the Democratic League, but because he is from the Northeast, he is only participating on behalf of himself and cannot be considered to be representing the Democratic League and cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM. The Democratic League continued to hold a foreign press conference.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Anping Town Conference Stalls; New Facts Discovered After Hearing Testimony; American and Communist Representatives Argue Over This <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 25th] The 25th team went to Anping to investigate yesterday afternoon. A new fact was discovered in the testimony of Cao Yuting, a resident of the town, namely that the Communist army had captured two American soldiers during the conflict between the Americans and Communists in Anping. According to the testimony of County Magistrate Ban of Xianghe County on the government side, this was indeed the case. The Communist army has now released the two Americans. This was not only not mentioned in the reports of the Communist witnesses in the past, but also never mentioned in the reports of the American witnesses in the past. Therefore, when Cao Yuting reported this yesterday, Colonel Martin, the American representative, seemed quite surprised, and Huang Yifeng, the Communist representative, also showed a state of unease. The adjournment and breakdown of the meeting afterwards seems to be related to the emergence of this new fact. According to Cao Yuting, shortly after gunshots were heard on the Ping-Lu Highway at noon on July 29, a Jeep and a truck under the surveillance of the Communist army drove from the highway and stopped briefly in front of his house. The driver of the Jeep was two American soldiers. They used broken Chinese to express their willingness to hand over their weapons to the Communist army in exchange for being released, but this request was rejected by the Communist army at the time. As for the driver of the other truck, it was a soldier of the Eighth Route Army. The capture of this truck was also not found in the reports of the American and Communist witnesses. When asked about this, it was already after 6:00 PM. Chairman Martin believed that Cao Yuting's testimony was extremely important. Since it was too late, he temporarily returned to Beiping and will come to Anping to inquire again tomorrow morning. Huang Yifeng, the Communist representative, insisted on completing the inquiry that night, otherwise it would give the government side an opportunity to fabricate evidence. Martin smiled and said, "The Anping incident happened almost a month ago. We were only able to conduct an investigation recently. Those who want to fabricate evidence have already had almost a month of ample time. We don't have to care about this one day." Zhang Shuhang, the government representative, said: "I went to Xianghe in the Communist area to listen to the testimony of witnesses designated by the CCP, and I didn't say anything. Why do you have such an attitude when you come to Anping? You say that the government is fabricating evidence and that it is unreliable. What is your basis? Please answer." Huang never answered this, and the meeting broke down. Another new fact reported by Cao Yuting that day was that on July 29, when the Communist army attacked the American army, they ordered a Hou from Anping to drive his oxcart and another neighbor's oxcart to the Ping-Jin Highway to block the road. Soon after they were placed, a car was intercepted on the highway, and the leg of a Yang surname driver was shot by the Communist army.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Famous Traitor Female Spy Jin Bihui's Case Is Serious; Hebei High Prosecutor's Office Actively Collects Evidence <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 25th] The traitorous female spy Jin Bihui (also known as Kawashima Yoshiko) was escorted to the Hebei High Court Prosecutor's Office among the sixth batch of traitors and imprisoned in the First Prison. Cui Tiezhong, Chief Prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, recognizing the seriousness of the case, went to the First Prison last week to hold a court investigation. It is learned that the High Prosecutor's Office is actively collecting evidence in this case. According to Mr. Cui, Jin was once known as "Commander Jin" because she led a guerrilla force to fight against our national army. The "cross-dressed beauty" (female spy) in novels and the "Dawn of Manchukuo" in movies are all sketches of Jin. The enemy's Japanese magazines such as "Fujin Koron", "Liang You", and "Da Zhou" all have records of Jin. It has been found that Jin's contacts in Japan were all important figures in the Japanese military, police, and gendarmerie, and she had close contact with enemy Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and his wife. Jin also contributed a "Memorandum of Opinion" to Tojo, and met Wang Jingwei at the home of Touyama Mitsuru, a veteran of the enemy's Japanese invasion of China. Her whereabouts are so secretive and important that they are international. Even British and American magazines have mentioned Jin. A letter from British military attache F.V. Foote can prove that Jin's work as a traitorous spy was famous overseas. Foote's letter contained three main points: (1) He firmly believed that this woman visited the Japanese Consul General in Hong Kong in September 1939 and had contact with Colonel Kajioka Niro, the head of the enemy's secret service in Guangzhou, and that the so-called "San Li" at the time was Jin. (2) Jin was the leader of the "White Fan Society," an organization of the enemy's Japanese Asian secret service. (3) Some people said that Jin was a sister of Kawashima Toyonobu, who led the enemy's Japanese southern agency in Burma.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 25th] Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province and General Li Moan, Commander of the First Pacification District, held a Jiangnan security meeting in Suzhou before. Although they reached a general agreement on the counterinsurgency issue, they could not thoroughly discuss important items such as mobilization steps due to time constraints. Therefore, it was decided to convene the First Pacification District Security Meeting in Changzhou at 9:00 AM on the 27th of this month, and ordered all commissioners and county magistrates in the jurisdiction and military commanders to personally attend to jointly discuss the detailed counterinsurgency strategies, including important issues such as mobilization, supplies, and aftermath. The county magistrate of this county has packed his bags and is ready to depart. It is also learned that General Tang Enbo is scheduled to fly from Nanjing to Kuling on the morning of the 26th to visit the Chairman to ask for instructions. If possible, he will rush back to attend.</p>
<h3 id="e26">General Rooks' Remarks; Denies Military Advisory Group to Move to Shanghai; Dormitories for Group Members' Families Under Construction in Nanjing <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] General Rooks, head of the US Military Advisory Group, denied reports to reporters on the morning of the 25th that the group was about to move to Shanghai for work. He also said: The group has not transferred any personnel to Shanghai recently, and no organization has moved there. It is said that the origin of this rumor is mainly due to the fact that the families of the advisory group personnel who recently came to China from the United States are temporarily staying in Shanghai because the dormitories in Nanjing have not yet been completed. Currently, the personnel dormitories here are under construction and will be completed within three months. At that time, the families of the personnel in Shanghai can move here. In order to convince reporters, he ordered Captain White of the group to accompany them to visit the dormitory construction site in the middle of Xikang Road. The site is located in a well-known residential area of Nanjing, covering an area of approximately three acres, and a huge building that can accommodate 30 families is under construction by a large number of workers. Construction began three months ago and will be completed in another three months. Construction of the other two buildings can begin as soon as they are completed. Captain White, who accompanied the reporters, although a single young man, seemed to be full of envy for the family life of his comrades elsewhere when he accompanied the reporters to visit the site.</p>

<p>Public Opinion Organizations in Jiangsu Province Limited to Completion by the End of September</p>
<p>[Quick News from Zhenjiang from Our Newspaper] The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in view of the fact that the National Assembly will be convened on November 12th this year, has determined that all levels of public opinion organizations should be established before the meeting to promptly implement constitutional government. The deadline for the completion of the People's Congresses in each county and the People's Representative Assemblies in townships and towns has been extended to the end of August. Now that the deadline has passed, no further delays will be allowed. Therefore, all counties are ordered to submit reports on the handling situation and the list of township and town people's representatives for verification.

<p>Methods for Collecting and Urging Payment of Land Tax in Wujin and Wuxing Counties</p>
<p>[Changzhou Correspondence from Our Newspaper] Land tax is being collected and borrowed to be used as military food. The quota assigned to this county is 20,000 shi, and orders have been issued to expedite the collection and delivery. However, at this time when the new harvest is not yet available, most grain households have no rice to pay. The county government, in view of this, has specially stipulated that grain households without rice to pay can temporarily pay 40,000 yuan per shi. The deadline is the 26th of this month, and the money should be paid to the Land Tax Collection and Loan Committee for purchasing on their behalf, and a receipt will be issued. Any surplus will be returned, and any deficiency must be made up. Special telegrams are sent to each district to be responsible for supervising and urging the payment by the deadline, without delay.</p>
<p>[Huzhou Correspondence from Our Newspaper] The Wuxing County Government received six articles of methods for autonomous organizations to assist in urging payment of land tax, drafted by the Zhejiang Provincial Land and Grain Office on the 22nd: (1) The head of each township and baojia should be responsible for assisting the taxation agencies in jointly urging the payment of land tax owed by each grain household within their jurisdiction. When necessary, the head of each township and baojia may also inspect the grain strings and investigate concealment of grain by grain households. (2) When the new tax is levied each year, the head of each baojia should notify all grain households of the standards for collecting youth tax, and be responsible for distributing land tax notices and guiding grain households to pay the tax. (3) If the head of each baojia finds households that owe taxes and repeatedly urges them without success, they may report to the county government or the county land and grain office to send personnel to urge payment. (4) If the households owing taxes still fail to pay after the county office sends personnel to urge payment, the head of each baojia should investigate the property of the indebted households and submit a list to the county office for legal processing. (5) If the head of each township and baojia intentionally conceals or engages in illegal activities related to the households owing taxes, they will be severely punished after verification. (6) The county office will conduct a thorough investigation of the performance of the head of each township and baojia in assisting in urging the payment of taxes and give appropriate rewards. County Magistrate Wang has already transferred the order to the township and town offices to follow.</p>
<p>Wuxi: The Merger of Townships and Towns Temporarily Maintains the Status Quo</p>

<h3 id="e28">How to Break the Political Stalemate? <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Hongbiao</p>
<p>From a year ago until now, the path that Chinese politics has taken is still "dragging"! "Dragging" not only cannot solve the problem, but also makes the problem more complicated and more difficult to solve? The shuttle diplomacy of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart did not bring the KMT-CPC negotiations any closer, and in recent days, the situation has been brewing for a future war between the two sides. The general public is often confused, depressed, and resentful due to the Communist Party's distorted propaganda and the organized instigation of some politicians. As for foreign friends, they often frankly use modern democratic ideals to measure China's problems, thinking that as long as they shout "democracy," the problem can be solved. But what is the result? Not only has the problem not been solved at all, but also extraneous issues have arisen, and wars are spreading everywhere?</p>
<p>When we examine China's political problems, we cannot ignore China's unique national conditions. China is somewhat different from any modern country.</p>
<p>First, China is far from being as developed as countries like Britain and the United States, and democratic politics have not yet fully grown. The highest public opinion institution has not yet been established. Although the current Political Consultative Council can be said to be a representative body of various parties, factions, and non-party members, the members of the Political Consultative Council are not entirely based on popular elections, and their powers are limited to review, suggestions, and consultations, so its democratic component is obviously small. As for the National Assembly, according to law, it is naturally the highest public opinion institution in the country, with the power to decide on important national issues. However, this institution has not yet been established at this time, and its most criticized points are: (1) The National Representatives were elected more than ten years ago, and the country and society have undergone great changes after eight years of war, so whether they can fully represent today's public opinion is questionable. (2) The National Representatives and elections use a single-member district system, that is, in an election district, only one person is elected as a representative based on the majority of votes. In this way, the majority of seats in the assembly will inevitably be occupied by the large party. Therefore, the Communist Party has always opposed the Kuomintang's proposal to convene the National Assembly to solve national problems. The country currently does not have a formal highest public opinion institution, so it naturally feels difficult to solve important national problems.</p>
<p>Second, China's military force is completely controlled by political parties today. The military force of a political party can only be loyal to the political party and be commanded by the political party. Once the political party wants to resist the central government and overthrow the government, its military force will become a tool for resistance and disruption. At this stage, the Kuomintang represents the people of the Republic of China in exercising state power, so the Kuomintang's military force has become the country's military force. And in this War of Resistance, they have indeed fulfilled the duties of a national army by resisting foreign aggression and defending the country. However, the Communist Party's military force still holds its narrow partisan concepts and engages in infighting and contention. During the War of Resistance, they constantly carried out surprise attacks in the rear of the National Army, confiscated the National Army's weapons, expanded their own territory, and weakened the National Army's strength in resisting Japan. These are all facts. But they want to use the opportunity of the War of Resistance to expand their military force in order to contend with the Kuomintang, which obviously goes against the interests of the country and the nation. The Communist Party's lack of a national concept is criticized by the general public. But the Communist Party is precisely using its increasingly powerful military force to prepare to seize power from the Kuomintang. If a proposal to abandon military force is put forward to it, it fundamentally violates its purpose of seizing power, and the Communist Party will ultimately reject it, despite its verbal agreement.</p>
<p>Third, the Republic of China is nominally a unified country, and the National Government is recognized by the world as the legitimate government representing the Republic of China. In a unified country, the command of the army and the highest power should belong to the central government. But in China, the Communist Party in opposition, because it holds military force, has occupied more than 300 counties as a base for political struggle. The CCP's army is not subject to the control and command of the central government. In its occupied areas, it has implemented class struggle and established a Soviet-style "Border Region Government." This force, which continues to expand and takes struggle as its mission, will inevitably continue to undermine peace and damage the country's vitality!</p>
<p>In addition to the above three points, there is also a basic contradiction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party that cannot be reconciled, that is, both have some tendencies towards dictatorship. However, the Kuomintang's "dictatorship" is ultimately to complete political tutelage and return power to the people, so it is only a process of implementing democratic politics. The Communist Party's dictatorship, on the other hand, has a permanent demand for autocracy in its system itself. Now the Communist Party often accuses the Kuomintang of being dictatorial. In fact, in all fairness, the Communist Party is more dictatorial than the Kuomintang. Fair American journalists have also said this. Because the Soviet system of proletarian dictatorship adopted by the Communist Party takes class struggle as a tool for seizing power. Its methods of violence and cruelty, as well as its treacherous and insidious tactics, are rarely seen in the world history of revolution. The success of the Soviet Communist Revolution was achieved by adopting a policy of great terror and great bloodshed, eliminating other classes and purging other political parties, so that it could establish its foundation. But the situation of the Chinese National Revolution is different. The Kuomintang's moral ideology is loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace. These are the unique royal way spirits of the Chinese nation. The Kuomintang has always shown compassion and tolerance in its revolutionary process. For example, if warlords abandon military force or express awareness, and believe in the Three People's Principles, the Kuomintang will not punish them, and will often give them positions so that they can work together for the country. If the Communist Party were in the position of the Kuomintang, then other classes and people with different political views would have no room for survival. Moreover, there would be countless great bloodshed and great terror, showing bestial cruelty, sharpness, and ruthlessness, which would damage the vitality of the country and the nation. How is that like the Kuomintang, which can still tolerate the existence of other parties even though it holds power, and still wants to implement party politics and return power to the people? Today, the Communist Party is attempting to seize power by violence, while at the same time using hypocritical propaganda to anesthetize young people and deceive the vulgar. This is just a propaganda technique made by the Communist Party with a distorted heart!</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot deny that the Kuomintang has maintained a one-party dictatorship system from the Northern Expedition to today after the War of Resistance. But this is necessary for removing obstacles and resisting foreign aggression. It is a temporary transitional measure. The ultimate goal of the Kuomintang's revolution and nation-building is to establish a national political state of the people, by the people, and for the people. This is the credibility of the Kuomintang leaders to the people of the whole country. But the Communist Party's dictatorship is different. Now the Communist Party is launching the so-called "three-assets struggle" in its various occupied areas, aiming to eliminate people who are qualified (knowledgeable), prestigious, and have assets, and purely organize the government with the proletariat. It can be seen that the military dictatorship taken by the Communist Party during the period of struggle is also its permanent political system after the struggle. This is fundamentally different from the Kuomintang. Because the Communist Party's struggle aims to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, where the Communist Party wants to recognize the Kuomintang's position and seek permanent cooperation between the two, it is truly "climbing a tree to catch fish." Even though last year's "Double Tenth Meeting Record" had promises of permanent cooperation, it is useless. When the Communist Party's strength is not sufficient, it may temporarily acknowledge cooperation with the Kuomintang as a strategic move. But when its strength is sufficient, it will still eliminate all other parties and complete the Communist Party's autocratic situation. Recently, the CCP has repeatedly provoked well-intentioned mediators, wanting them to know the difficulty and retreat. It can be seen that it has no sincerity in consultation and negotiation at all.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the other side, countless Kuomintang members have shed their blood and lost their lives for revolution and nation-building for half a century. Since they have already obtained state power, they will definitely not easily give up their task of nation-building and hand it over to the Communist Party to implement communism, which at least Kuomintang members believe is not in line with the national conditions. Therefore, the Communist Party's attempt to use inferior military force and the method of "dragging" to drag down the Kuomintang and overthrow the National Government is just a futile illusion.</p>
<p>However, this is indeed a rigid situation. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have tried various reconciliation plans, but they have all failed. Can this dispute be resolved through peaceful negotiations?</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at the precedents of revolution and nation-building in advanced countries. Since the defeat of the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan, countries in the world today can be divided into two major categories in terms of political systems: one is democratic countries, represented by Britain and the United States; the other is totalitarian countries, represented by the Soviet Union. The development of British democratic politics can be said to be an evolutionary history of civil rights and monarchical power. Since the 19th century, British monarchical power has continued to shrink, while civil rights have continued to develop. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, monarchical power was completely overwhelmed by civil rights. At that time, the Liberal and Conservative parties, the former advocated civil rights without opposing the monarchy, and the latter supported monarchical power without opposing parliamentary politics. Therefore, the policies of the two parties had a harmonious color and did not tend to extremes. Therefore, for hundreds of years, the two parties have taken turns in power and have gotten along well. Recently, the Conservative Party and the Labor Party are opposed to each other, and their fundamental positions on parliamentary politics are the same in their belief. The independence of the United States was only the liberation of the colonial people from British resistance. Its political ideals are based on the civil rights thought of the nineteenth century. In its nation-building process, the northern states, due to the development of industry and commerce, wanted to open up markets, and advocated that each state was a local group. The southern states were all agricultural societies and wanted to maintain a separatist situation, and advocated that the central government was only a federation. The two sides did not give in to each other and both held military force, thus causing the so-called "Civil War" - which is what historians call the "Civil War." In the end, the South failed, and the United States became a unified federal country, and the wealth and strength of the United States was based on this. After the Russian Communist Party seized power in the October Revolution, it used harsh means to mercilessly eliminate other classes and parties, and the Soviet government had a solid foundation and completed its communist construction.</p>
<p>What do the examples of the above three countries illustrate? (1) The example of Britain illustrates that if there are two major parties in a country, both without party military forces, and their political views are not very different and there is no fundamental conflict, and the people of that country have a high level of political awareness and correct judgment, then the political problems of that country are easily solved by ordinary means. (2) The example of the United States illustrates that if there are two military forces in a country that are not subordinate to each other and are developing towards the same space, and they have fundamentally different concepts about the structure of the country, then conflict and war will inevitably occur. At that time, if the United States used negotiation, it must first recognize the split situation, then the unified federal state of the United States would have no way to establish it. Only after a war of unification can we talk about peace and democracy. (3) The example of Russia illustrates that a party that has seized power by military force must eliminate the opposition party - at least its military force - in order to ensure its position and realize its doctrine; otherwise, the domestic order cannot be stabilized, the policy cannot be realized, the people's livelihood will become increasingly difficult, and the people's hearts will be lost, and it will be wiped out day by day. This is creating an opportunity for the opposition party to "replace it."</p>
<p>China's current situation, in the situation of military division, is very similar to the United States during the period of brewing the Civil War. The Kuomintang's grasp of political power is very similar to the Soviet Russia after the October Revolution. And with Britain, there are no similar signs in any aspect. Can you ask the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to follow the example of the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party in Britain? Can the Communist Party give up its advocacy of class struggle and proletarian dictatorship? Is it possible to turn China into Britain? China's current situation is the situation of the United States during the Civil War, the situation of the warlords dividing local areas; it is also the situation before and after the October Revolution in Soviet Russia, and it is even more the situation where the Communist Party wants to seize power. If the South in the United States did not give up its military force at that time and the North made peace negotiations with it, then there would be only two ways to go: (1) Recognize the split of the country, the two countries confront each other, and each goes its own way. (2) One party unconditionally handed over its military force to the other party - but this is impossible. If the first path was taken at that time, then in addition to maintaining the slave system and free trade policies, did South America have other ambitions for North America? If it is split into two countries, demarcating boundaries may maintain long-term peace, but unification is impossible. The Chinese Communist Party, when it did not have a territory, still had to riot and compete for territory. Now that it has considerable territory and military force, will it be willing to give up its various attempts to seize power before it has realized all its plans for the Chinese Soviet Government? The situation in North and South America in the past was simpler than today's China, and even with President Lincoln's kindness, it still ultimately relied on military force to resolve it. And in China, wanting to always clamor for peaceful consultation and seek a solution, how can it be effective? Again, in the Soviet Union, if the Communist Party could not quickly purge the opposing factions after seizing power in the October Revolution, then his power would not be consolidated, and communism would not be realized. Moreover, after the time is delayed, the people will inevitably feel pain, and the people will gradually feel disappointed and disoriented with the ruling party. Thus, the more a solution to the problem is sought, the more difficult it is to solve. Unfortunately, China's current situation is exactly like this!</p>
<p>China's Kuomintang cannot be like the Bolsheviks in Soviet Russia, who can quickly eliminate the reaction and consolidate its power, nor can it follow the example of Lincoln in the United States to end the confrontation between the North and the South with military force, so that the country can enter a unified and stable domain, but only wanders on a fork in the road, which only increases the suffering of the people. This is really puzzling.</p>
<p>We have no prejudice against the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but this stalemate must be broken in order to avoid major problems. The author now solemnly puts forward the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The whole world is disgusted with war. The Chinese people have been liberated in nine deaths and one life, and are already exhausted and can no longer endure war.</p>
<p>(2) The Chinese people cannot be satisfied with the status quo, but they have not despaired, and they are urging the government to seek progress. If the Communist Party wants to overthrow the National Government with inferior military force and a small number of territories, causing long-term chaos and ruining the life of the nation, it is violating the will of the people.</p>
<p>(3) The existence of the Communist Party and the Kuomintang's principle of implementing party politics do not violate each other. We do not advocate that the government take an oppressive attitude towards the Communist Party's political activities, but if the Communist Party's army still divides local areas and undermines unity, we should regard it as a rebellious military force, and the government should quickly impose sanctions and not allow it to spread rampantly.</p>
<p>(4) We believe that suppressing rebellion is one thing, and opening up political power is another. The Communist Party should not use opposition to holding the government as an excuse to cover up its rebellious actions; the Kuomintang should not use the Communist army's division as an excuse to extend the period of implementation of its opening of political power. In other words, the government should suppress the rebellion on one hand and hurry up to end political tutelage and implement constitutional government on the other hand. When a true constitutional government is implemented, the Communist army will lose its excuse for initiating rebellion; and the implementation of constitutional government will be smoother when the rebellious military force is suppressed. Therefore, the two should be carried out in parallel and simultaneously.</p>
<p>In short, China's political problems should be measured by the happiness of the people and the vitality of the country. What the people fear most now is civil war, and they are all praying for the exemption of civil war. But if the rebellious military force attempts to overthrow the government, forcing the government to come out and suppress it, then we can only unanimously support the government and concentrate the strength of the whole country to crush this rebellious offensive. In this way, the war can be ended in the shortest possible time, and the suffering and sacrifice of the people can be reduced to a minimum. (August 22, 1946 in Shanghai)</p>

<h3 id="e29">Ukraine Files Complaint with the UN Security Council, Accusing Greece of Endangering Peace; Claims Balkan Unrest is Caused by Britain; Another Diplomatic Offensive by the Eastern European Bloc <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Comprehensive Report] According to a United Press report from Paris, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky held a reception for reporters on the 24th, announcing that he is filing a complaint with the United Nations Security Council, accusing the Greek government of endangering international peace in the Balkans. It is alleged that the presence of British troops in Greece and the direct interference of British representatives on behalf of the monarchist faction in Greek internal affairs are the main factors contributing to the instability of the Balkan situation. Mr. Manuilsky requested the Security Council to review the entire situation in the Balkans at its next meeting, stating that the danger to peace is due to the policies adopted by the Greek government. Greece is scheduled to hold a public referendum on September 1st, and the presence of foreign troops supporting elements who collaborated with the German invaders inevitably violates the aims and principles of the United Nations Charter. Holding a public referendum under these circumstances would also be contrary to the war aims announced by the United Nations during and after the war, which recognized the right of all countries to freely determine their own destiny and political system. The irresponsible policies adopted by the current Greek government, following those adopted since the opening of the peace conference, have created a situation that poses a serious danger to the security of the Balkans. Countless border incidents have occurred at the border between Greece and Albania, all provoked by Greek armed forces and encouraged by the Greek authorities. Greek troops have opened fire on Albanian border guards and on Albanian farmers engaged in cultivation. These incidents, coupled with the intrusion of Greek armed forces into Albanian territory, are clearly intended to provoke a war against Albania, under the pretext of occupying its southern territory. Ukraine's complaint is in response to the accusation made by Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Galadze a week ago at the peace conference, alleging that Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris had proposed that Greece and Yugoslavia divide Albania between them. Mr. Manuilsky continued that the public declarations of the representatives of the current Greek government, and their speeches at the peace conference, insisting that a state of war exists between Greece and Albania, have further heightened tensions in the Balkans. The Greek government's oppression of the minorities in Macedonia, Sedans, and Epirus has caused tens of thousands to take refuge in neighboring countries to avoid being slaughtered. Macedonia and Thrace are both in northern Greece, which Bulgaria desires in order to gain access to the Aegean Sea. Epirus borders Albania, and Greece has made demands for border adjustments. Mr. Manuilsky concluded that the dangerous situation in the Balkans today is facilitated by the presence of British troops in Greece and the interference of British representatives on behalf of the monarchist faction in Greek internal affairs.</p>

<p>According to a report from Agence France-Presse: Upon hearing the news, Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris immediately issued a statement saying: "I am very pleased with the actions of the Ukrainian representative. The real threat to peace and security is Albania, and this should be exposed. However, the Ukrainian representative's request is likely due to the Soviet Union's desire to divert the world's attention away from its failure at the peace conference. The frequent border disputes between Greece and Albania should be blamed on Albania. The rumors of British troops interfering in Greek internal affairs are simply not true. We were elected by the Greek people and will continue to work hard, taking only the national interest as our premise in all measures. External threats will not delay the holding of the public referendum. I believe that the United Nations Security Council will uphold justice and will not lightly believe the allegations made by the representatives of Ukraine and Albania."</p>

<p>According to a Reuters report: A spokesman for the British Foreign Office in Paris said: Ukraine's complaint will not improve the atmosphere of the Paris Peace Conference. Although it is currently impossible to judge who is right and who is wrong, the repeated incursions of Albanians into Greek territory are well-known facts. I believe that Ukraine's move is in response to the United States' intention to file a complaint with the Security Council regarding the shooting down of an American plane by Yugoslavia. It is recalled that the last time the Security Council met, shortly after Britain and the United States raised the issue of Iran, Ukraine also raised the issue of Indonesia with the Security Council. I sincerely do not know what interests Ukraine has in Indonesia and Albania.</p>

This is our sincere wish, but we do not yet know what the United States' opinion is. Two major Romanian entrepreneurs will soon go to the United States to formally discuss this matter. Many people in our country believe that the United States does not want to help us, but I believe that all difficulties can be overcome.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Yugoslavia Has Complied with the Ultimatum, U.S.-Yugoslav Relations Trending Toward Relaxation; Yugoslavia Agrees to Compensate for Damage to American Plane <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Comprehensive Report] The tense relations between the United States and Yugoslavia have eased as Yugoslavia released the detained American pilots, assisted the American representatives in investigating the truth about the downed American plane, and Marshal Tito gave a verbal guarantee that such incidents would not happen again. According to an Agence France-Presse report from Washington, the State Department announced on the 24th that Yugoslavia's response to the American ultimatum has been delivered directly to Secretary of State Byrnes, who is currently in Paris, but Washington has not yet received it. U.S. Ambassador to Yugoslavia Patterson is sending daily reports to the State Department, and Acting Secretary of State Acheson is consulting with Secretary of State Byrnes in Paris and President Truman in Bermuda via long-distance telephone to seek instructions. The only remaining issue is the matter of compensation for the damage to the American plane. Diplomatic sources believe that, given the current situation, the United States may no longer insist on a formal response to the ultimatum. Regarding the issue of compensation, although the United States has not yet raised it, Yugoslav President Tito told U.S. Ambassador Patterson that this compensation will naturally be paid. However, some individuals do not feel overly optimistic, as they believe that the Yugoslav incident is actually an initial contact between the United States and the Soviet Union, with Yugoslavia merely serving as a figurehead. Meanwhile, according to a United Press report, although the U.S. government has indicated that Yugoslavia has yielded to the American ultimatum, the possibility of filing a complaint with the Security Council regarding the American plane being shot down still exists. A State Department official stated that whether or not to take this action will depend on official proof of the circumstances under which the American plane was shot down, and Yugoslavia's efforts to correct its mistaken behavior. The so-called "mistaken behavior" includes the deaths of five pilots on the second American plane.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] The U.S. Army Air Forces announced today that air defense forces will soon be established throughout the country to assist the regular air force in protecting national defense in the event of emergencies. The new organization is similar to the land defense force, and members will be recruited from volunteers in 48 states, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, including 3,000 pilots, 5,000 junior officers, and 50,000 soldiers, possessing 72 fighter squadrons and 12 light bomber squadrons. Some of the aircraft are equipped with the latest jet engines.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] The Army Air Forces has recently established an Air University, including five colleges, to train air force officers to cope with air warfare in the atomic age. According to the announcement of the team, the basic goal of establishing the Air University is to cultivate an air force capable of defeating any powerful enemy attacking the strategic locations of its national economic lifeline. As soon as the Air Force receives notification, it can immediately go to bomb enemy cities flat. To prepare for tomorrow's air war, all Army Air Forces officers must enter the university for about five years of research. General Vandenberg, the second-in-command of the school, said that a powerful air force is the greatest force to suppress war and the greatest guarantee for maintaining world peace.</p>

<p>Various Issues Urgently Need to Be Handled</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Well-informed sources here believe that Foreign Secretary Bevin's return to London from Paris today is to consult with Prime Minister Attlee at the end of the month on the following issues: (1) The current situation after the refusal of Britain, the United States, and Turkey to consider the Soviet Union's proposal to amend the status of the Black Sea Straits; (2) The crisis in Yugoslavia; (3) The lack of progress at the Paris Peace Conference; (4) The situation in Palestine; (5) The final decision on the issue of Jewish participation in the London Palestine Conference. The aforementioned topics and their relationship to the international situation are also said to be raised for discussion at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The British Cabinet will hold a meeting at the beginning of next week to discuss the situation in Egypt. It is reported that negotiations in Cairo are currently at a standstill. It is said that Bevin has indicated to the Egyptian Ambassador to Britain that if Egypt wants to form an alliance with Britain, it must first give Britain a position that can be fulfilled. If the Egyptian government needs to consider Egyptian public opinion, then Britain also needs to consider its domestic public opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e38">U.S. Naval Attachés Withdraw from Vladivostok and Other Regions in Soviet Territory; U.S. Request to Establish Additional Consulates Unanswered; Currently Considering Taking Countermeasures Against the Soviet Union <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 25th Broadcast: The U.S. State Department announced that the Soviet Union has requested the withdrawal of the U.S. naval attachés from Vladivostok and Arkhangelsk (a major port on the White Sea). The Department's spokesman said: These naval attachés were stationed in the above two locations under the Lend-Lease Act. Now that the Lend-Lease Act has ended, there is no reason to continue the stationing. It is also learned that the United States has requested the Soviet government to allow the establishment of additional U.S. consulates in Soviet territory, but has not yet received a response.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] The dismissal of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Litvinov is seen by American diplomatic circles as a blow by the Soviet Union to British-American cooperation. At the same time, it is even more significant that the Stalin regime has greatly increased its control over the Soviet people and excluded Western countries from exploring the internal situation of the Soviet Union. The United States is directly concerned about this, as the U.S. naval attachés have, at the request of the Soviet government, withdrawn from Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok. The U.S. attaché stationed in Odessa is temporary in nature, as he is responsible for inspecting ships entering and leaving the Allied Forces. As a result of the restrictions on American representatives in Soviet territory, only the attaché stationed in Austria, the embassy in Moscow, and the consulate in Vladivostok remain. To date, the Soviet Union has ignored the United States' request to establish consulates in other cities in the Soviet Union. They do not even want to answer this question. As a result, U.S. authorities are seriously considering issuing deportation orders to some Soviet consulates in the United States, but no decision has yet been made.</p>

<p>The news of Litvinov's dismissal arrived at the same time as news of the purge of the Ukrainian Communist Party. It is said that the purge movement is taking place everywhere. The Leningrad literary magazine was sealed off for reflecting Western thought, which is the result of the development of the purge movement. All of this proves that Soviet nationalism is growing stronger, and the Stalin regime's control over the country is tightening. Litvinov was a symbol of opposition to this movement.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Well-informed sources here believe that the notes sent by the United States to the Soviet Union and countries within the Soviet sphere of influence last week are a new diplomatic policy of the United States, intended to draw a line for "Soviet expansionism." If this line is crossed, friction with the United States will be inevitable. It is said that this diplomatic action was the result of President Truman's consultation with senior diplomats and military advisors to adjust U.S. policy before leaving Washington for his trip last week. Qualified observers here believe that the main reasons for setting this diplomatic policy are three: namely (1) Soviet diplomacy is looking for "soft spots" in the American diplomatic front. From Poland to Korea in the Soviet world, the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union are different. (2) The Soviet Union wants to undermine the strength of the United States in order to seize the United States' leadership in Western Europe and Asia. (3) The Soviet Union is trying to get the United States to withdraw from Europe, first diplomatically and then militarily. The United States has taken this into consideration, so it has changed its diplomatic policy to show that there is no "soft spot" in the U.S. diplomatic policy, and it also shows that the era of concessions in the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam Conferences has passed.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th] Diplomatic sources here believe that the dismissal of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Litvinov is part of a reorganization plan for the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Most observers, given the recent development of Soviet foreign policy, believe that Litvinov's departure, and his policy of "collective security" and understanding of small countries, have long been outdated. In the future, the Soviet authorities will solve international problems based on the decisions of the three or five major powers, or even bilateral agreements. The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs still feels understaffed after the appointments of Gusev and Malik were announced. It is expected that Gusev will be Stalin's expert on Western problems, and Malik will be his expert on Eastern problems. However, there were originally six Deputy Foreign Ministers, but now there are only four. One of the vacancies will be filled by an advisor on Middle Eastern issues.</p>

<p>To Explore the Opinions of Both Indonesian and Dutch Parties</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 24th] Lord Gillean, British Special Commissioner for Southeast Asia, is scheduled to arrive here from Singapore on Monday. It is reported that the purpose of this trip is to explore the opinions of both the Indonesian and Dutch parties on future negotiations. Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir stated in June when he made a counter-proposal that future negotiations must be held in neutral territory and chaired by a neutral person. He proposed three Englishmen as chairmen and recognized the consular office in Batavia as neutral territory. Later, due to the reorganization of the Dutch government and the kidnapping of some Indonesian leaders, negotiations were suspended. A Dutch spokesman said today that when negotiations resume, they may be based on the proposal made by Dutch Deputy Governor-General Van Mook in May and the Indonesian counter-proposal. The contents of these two documents have not yet been announced. It is reported that the distance between the two sides is still quite far.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Well-informed sources here believe that the arrival of British Special Commissioner for South Asia Gillean in Batavia is because Britain wants to know the future of resolving the current dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands, as Britain still has a large number of troops stationed in the Dutch East Indies. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain has no intention of sending senior diplomats to participate in mediation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Comprehensive Report] According to a Reuters report: British Foreign Secretary Bevin flew back to London from Paris on the 24th to report to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet on the development of the Peace Conference and the progress of the Dominion representatives' meeting. Before leaving, he spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes for about an hour. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt and Canadian Prime Minister King are also scheduled to depart for their respective countries on the 24th and 25th. The Political and Territorial Committee of the Hungarian Treaty resolved on the 24th to include the memorandum submitted by Hungary, which requested recognition of its contribution to the Allied forces, in the record. The Political and Territorial Committee of the Romanian Treaty also met for two and a half hours to discuss the amendments proposed by Australia. The Economic Committee of the Italian Treaty also met on the night of the 24th, but did not enter into specific discussions. Agence France-Presse said that representatives from various countries have proposed as many as 250 amendments to the draft treaties, of which 192 are important. This is enough to affect the progress of the Peace Conference. The amendments proposed by the Yugoslav representative nearly require all the clauses of the draft treaties to be amended. The second is the Australian representative, who proposed a total of 52 amendments. Writing the amendments requires a large amount of paper, and cars have been sent to Calais and Geneva to transport them. The Peace Conference Secretariat has borrowed three printing presses from the United Nations, which will soon be transported by plane. It is expected that various amendments will be distributed to representatives of various countries by Monday afternoon. The Russian and French translations have been completed, but the English translation has not yet been completed. According to a Reuters report: It is rumored here that the Paris Peace Conference may be recessed for two weeks, or will begin in early September. Although the delegations said they did not know about this, the Secretariat is already taking measures. Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange returned to Oslo from Paris on the 24th. It is said that the Paris Peace Conference may be postponed to November, but before that date, there may be some definite decisions.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th Special Dispatch] Quo Tai-Chi, the representative of China attending the Paris Peace Conference, said in a radio speech to the country on the night of the 23rd that China is extremely concerned about all colonial issues, and the Paris Peace Conference is expected to make a clear announcement on the general principles related to the entire colonial issue. Although the Paris Peace Conference is mainly to solve European problems, it can also set an example for the future peace conference with Japan. Therefore, we are closely watching everything that the Paris Peace Conference is doing, hoping to use the experience of the Paris Peace Conference as a reference for future peace work with Japan. Regarding the establishment of peace, he said: Peace is indeed difficult to obtain. Since war is a long-term matter, it will also take a considerable amount of time to establish peace. Therefore, we must also treat the struggle for peace with patience and determination, just as we have shown in the long war.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Sobolev flew to Paris today to present a memorandum of protest to the five major foreign ministers regarding the further postponement of the United Nations General Assembly. The United Nations General Assembly was originally scheduled to convene on September 3rd, but it was later changed to September 23rd at the former site of the New York World's Fair. Recently, it was rumored that at least some of the five major leaders currently in Paris, in view of the slow progress of the Paris Peace Conference, advocate further postponement of the meeting.</p>
<p>[Additional Dispatch] According to a United Nations spokesperson, the United Nations General Assembly, starting on September 23rd and lasting for seven weeks at the former site of the World's Fair in New York's Long Island, is estimated to hold 300 to 400 meetings. It is expected that representatives from various countries will engage in fierce debates on issues such as the agenda and the abolition of atomic warfare. It is projected that there will be 35 plenary sessions and 15 to 20 meetings of the Steering Committee. The six main committees and thirty subcommittees will meet at Lake Success in Long Island, averaging ten meetings each. The General Assembly Secretariat will recommend that all meetings be fully open to the press, radio, and the general public. Belgian representative Spaak, who served as chairman of the General Assembly in London, will once again serve as chairman of the New York General Assembly. The chairman of the General Assembly, the seven vice-chairmen, and the chairmen of the six main committees will form the Steering Committee. The seven vice-chairmen are the chief representatives of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, the Union of South Africa, and Venezuela. The six main committees are as follows: (1) "Political and Security Committee": will study the voting rights of new member states, the Security Council's agenda and reports, issues concerning the limitation of veto power, and the questions of Spain and atomic warfare. The last meeting was stalled by these issues, so this committee bears a particularly heavy responsibility this time.

<h3 id="e47">Marshal Tito, the Yugoslav President Who Participated in the Soviet Revolutionary War, Originally Named Broz, Came from a Peasant Family; Once Trafficked People to Spain, Aiding the Civil War <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] Marshal Tito rose during the war, transforming from a communist underground worker into the leader of the Yugoslav government, and a reward was once offered for his head. Fifty-four years ago, he was born into a peasant family in the village of Kumrovec, originally named Broz. Tito is a pseudonym he used to avoid the attention of the anti-communist government under the former King Alexander. Currently, he is known in Yugoslavia as "Comrade Tito." After leaving the countryside, Tito became a metallurgical worker and served as the head of the metallurgical workers' union. At the age of twenty-two, World War I broke out, and he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army, as Yugoslavia was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1915, he fled to the Soviet Union and participated in the Red Army's revolutionary war. After the success of the Soviet revolution, he returned to Yugoslavia as a radical agitator. In 1928, he was sentenced to six years in prison and remained under police surveillance after his release. He then returned to Zagreb and engaged in underground activities. When World War II broke out, he served as the Secretary-General of the Yugoslav Communist Party. During the Spanish Civil War, Tito was a major trafficker, privately transporting people to Spain to fight against Franco. These individuals, upon returning from Spain, became cadres in his Yugoslav commando unit. When the German army entered Yugoslavia in 1941, Tito was in Zagreb. His commando unit's first anti-German action occurred when the German army invaded the Soviet Union. The commando unit included both guerilla fighters and political operatives, with each unit having a political commissar and instructor. Well-trained propagandists were spread throughout the country, working for him. Tito claimed to have crushed seven "movements to overthrow Tito." By November of last year, Tito had become the leader of the National Liberation Government, and the new Yugoslav government replaced Peter II's government. Tito served as chairman, prime minister, defense minister, and commander-in-chief of the national army. He has visited the Soviet Union several times, holding talks in the Kremlin. His most recent visit to the Soviet Union coincided with the trial of the anti-communist leader Mihailović in Yugoslavia, who was eventually executed. Tito's office and private residence are located in the "White House" called Iheritov, which is heavily guarded. He has an only son named Žarko, aged twenty-one, who serves as an infantry lieutenant in the army.</p>

<p>"New Realism"</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris Dispatch] The atomic age seems to have given rise to a new school of painting. The art exhibition recently held here at the Galerie des Beaux-Arts displays works that claim to break away from all external reality and the constraints of painting. These artists proclaim "New Realism," and their paintings are bizarre in shape. The audience sees only spirals and curves, a collection of imaginative artistic fire. They use strange patterns to paint distorted human figures. In another corner of the exhibition hall are sculptures of bizarre shapes. These artworks are difficult to understand, but many people still admire this school of painting. Most professional critics believe that this type of art deserves further study, and it is expected that these strange and unusual works will become fashionable for a time.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Viceroy Wavell's Broadcast Speech Urges Muslim League to Join the Government; Cabinet Minister Aman Khan Wounded in Assassination Attempt <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Combined News Report] The interim government of India was established on the 24th, but the Muslim League has not cooperated and refuses to participate. According to a German news agency dispatch from New Delhi, five hours after announcing the establishment of the interim government, Indian Governor-General Wavell delivered a broadcast speech to the people of India, appealing to all political parties in India to work together for the benefit of the country. He said: "We have repeatedly invited the Muslim League to jointly form the interim government of India, and even now, this door is not yet closed. I hereby restate that the number of members is set at fourteen, of which six will be nominated by the Congress Party, three will be representatives of minority parties, and the remaining five can be nominated to me by the Muslim League. If I agree, and with the approval of the British King, these five can immediately join the interim government. The Muslim League need not worry about not being able to intervene in important issues, because a coalition government can only exist if both major parties are satisfied. Important departments will be jointly responsible by both sides. I firmly believe that the Muslim League will reconsider its policy and decide to participate in the government with sincerity. We must be patient. The recent disturbances in Calcutta serve as a wake-up call. It must be understood that激烈言行,無論對於個人社會,以及國家均無利益可言(intense words and deeds are not beneficial to individuals, society, or the country). As for the administration of the provinces, within the scope of provincial autonomy, the provincial governments have extensive powers and are not interfered with by the central government. The new government will have no power or intention to infringe upon the scope of provincial administration. The Minister of the Army in the new government will be an Indian. This change has been endorsed by the Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army and myself. However, the constitutional position of the army is not affected, and the army should abide by its oath and remain loyal to the British King, and I remain responsible to the King and Parliament. Although the current situation is difficult to be optimistic about, I firmly believe that there is still an opportunity for an agreement between the two major parties, and a majority of people from both parties will support such an agreement. If the Muslim League can participate, the interim government can be reorganized tomorrow, and all its administrative facilities should take national interests as the premise, and party interests or religious interests are not to be considered. I firmly believe that the Muslim League will reconsider its decision not to participate in the government, because this plan to organize the interim government is sufficient to protect the interests of Indian Muslims and determine their future."</p>
<p>After the Governor-General's broadcast speech, according to a Reuters dispatch from Munsar, Muslim League Chairman Jinnah stated on the night of the 24th that he needed to study Governor-General Wavell's broadcast speech in detail before he could express his opinion. According to a New Delhi wire, Governor-General Wavell and Congress Party leader Nehru may hold talks with Muslim League leader Jinnah in the near future, and senior Muslim League officials have expressed their welcome to this.</p>
<p>While the two sides were seeking rapprochement, an unfortunate incident suddenly occurred. According to a Reuters dispatch from Simla, Aman Khan, a member of the interim government, was attacked on the night of the 24th while walking home after a stroll, suffering seven knife wounds, but is now out of danger. The two assailants escaped and are being sought. Aman Khan is a Muslim, but not a member of the Muslim League.</p>

<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 25th] Puyi, who played the role of the main character in the puppet show directed by Japanese warlords and is now recounting his ten-year emperor dream at the Tokyo International Tribunal, is currently living in a two-story Western-style house in the Allied forces dormitory as a witness. It is simple and chic, this is the "imperial residence" where the puppet emperor is staying in Tokyo. When he has time, he reads English newspapers in front of the eaves, where cicadas chirp. Although he has been testifying in court for days, he does not appear tired. Since arriving in Tokyo, he has been living in this residence with Soviet Colonel Alekishunte and five other Soviet officials, spending his leisure time in peace. He gets up every morning at 7:00, does some light exercises, has breakfast with Colonel Alekishunte and others at 8:00, has dinner at 7:00 every night, and before going to bed at 11:00, he either reads or plays Western chess, enjoying the summer evenings. In the reception room of the residence, the flesh-colored curtains and various decorations complement each other, creating a Chinese atmosphere. Among the decorations are valuable items such as Chinese ceramics. The Soviet military's preferential treatment of Puyi can be seen from this. Today, the reporter visited Puyi in his reception room. He held a Soviet-made cigarette, smoking leisurely, and told the reporter: "This time, I came to Japan to testify and live a leisurely life with my close friends. I also went to the city to visit. Unlike my previous 'visit' to Tokyo, which was very restricted, I feel comfortable both physically and mentally."</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Due to the post-war commercial depression in China and Japan, the American Pacific shipping industry is now opening up new commercial markets in Malaya and the East Indies. American shipping companies, which previously mostly operated on routes to China, Japan, the Philippines, and even India, are now seeking rights to expand their scope from the East Indies through Malaya to the Bay of Bengal, in order to transport rubber products, tin, coconuts, and other products from that region. Before the war, only three American shipping companies operated on the East Indies route. Currently, six other companies are seeking to join the route.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Wife and Son of Martyr Zhang Yongchun Die Tragically on Route Bisson; U.S. Army Doctor's Car Mounts Sidewalk Causing a Series of Accidents; Driver Attempts to Flee and is Arrested <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Madam Cheng Dingjun, the wife of the late Shanghai Municipal Party Committee member Zhang Yongchun, is currently the principal of a municipal primary school. At 7:20 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 24th), she was returning to school after purchasing textbooks from a bookstore, accompanied by her second son, Zhang Pingxun (17 years old), when suddenly a U.S. Army hospital car, Shanghai Kuo 41194, driven by a Russian named George Chobuts, speeding out of control, mounted the sidewalk where Madam Zhang and her son were walking. Madam Zhang and her son could not avoid it. Zhang Pingxun, 17, was killed instantly next to the roadside bamboo fence. Madam Zhang was also thrown more than ten feet away, suffering serious injuries. The driver of the military car, seeing that he had caused an accident, attempted to escape, but a tree planted by the roadside was also knocked down, blocking his path. Passersby noticed and reported it to the police officer on duty at the time, number 201, who took the Russian driver to the police station. Under questioning, it was revealed that before causing the accident in front of number 51 on Route Bisson, the military car had similarly mounted the sidewalk at the intersection of Route Xujiahui and Route Halaraste, number 160, smashing a large hole in the stone wall of number 160. The driver fled in panic, but unexpectedly caused this major accident on Route Bisson. Therefore, there is no doubt that the driver should bear absolute responsibility for the occurrence of such unfortunate events. After being seriously injured, Madam Zhang was immediately sent to the U.S. Army Hospital on Route Haig for emergency treatment, but it was ineffective. She was then transferred to Guangci Hospital, where she died of her injuries at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. After Madam Zhang was seriously injured, she was unable to speak and provide details to notify her family. Later, an address was found in her briefcase, revealing that she was the wife of the martyr Zhang Yongchun. Martyr Zhang was a former member of the Municipal Party Committee. In 1943, he was arrested by the enemy, tortured with poisonous means, and forced to confess. Zhang remained loyal and died for his cause. Martyr Zhang left behind five children, the youngest of whom is now only three years old. Zhang's family was in dire straits, and the family's expenses were supported by Madam Zhang's hard work. Now, unfortunately, Madam Zhang and her beloved son have also suffered misfortune, and the lives of the remaining four children are a cause for concern. It is learned that the bodies of Madam Cheng and her son are scheduled to be placed in coffins at the Yianping Road Funeral Parlor on the afternoon of the 26th.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Enlisting Domestic Technicians to Establish Post-War Industry and Commerce; Shanghai Branch of China Production Promotion Association Established <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association held its inaugural meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Hall yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. Representatives from various circles, including Zhang Wei, Zhu Ping, Xi Yushu, Luo Qinghua, Xu Jiguang, and others, from 41 units, as well as more than a hundred members, attended. The meeting began with a speech by Chairman Mao Qingxiang, stating that since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, insightful people in the industrial and commercial sectors, in view of the stability and turmoil of the economy in the rear during the war, as well as the development and stagnation of production, which are the main factors determining the outcome of modern warfare, invited government leaders, social dignitaries, and authorities from various fields to jointly establish the China Wartime Production Promotion Association in Hankou in the spring of 1938. Due to sudden changes in the environment, the association headquarters was moved to Chongqing. Over the past eight years, members have worked hard and made the greatest contribution and responsibility to the War of Resistance. When the war improved and victory was in sight, in order to cooperate with the government's national construction plan, the general assembly passed a resolution to report the cancellation of the word "wartime," intending to continue to forge ahead after the victory in accordance with the original purpose, so that it would become a national and permanent industrial and commercial social organization. Shanghai is the economic hub and industrial and commercial center of the country, so it is especially necessary to establish a branch. At a time when society has not stabilized, labor and capital have not been coordinated, imports and exports cannot be balanced, and factory takeovers have not been well done, industry and commerce are on the verge of collapse. The future work of this association is very arduous. This association should fully absorb domestic technical experts and people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about production as members, and try to invest a large amount of floating capital in domestic production, promote the standardization of production, and the capital cooperation movement, in order to establish new post-war production enterprises, strengthen China's own industry and commerce, and hope that the industrial and commercial circles will pay attention to scientific research in order to improve China's backward industry and commerce. Then, Mao Shengdong reported on the preparations, stating that the preparations began on the 27th of last month and have lasted only four weeks. The first week was spent handling form registration and other procedures. Currently, more than 220 units have participated, and the association's address is currently applying to the municipal government for allocation and is temporarily located at 37 Route Mahou. After the report, Xu Lunqing, Hu Boxiang, Pan Shihao, and others gave speeches in succession. An honorary salute telegram to the chairman was temporarily passed. Finally, honorary directors, including Wu Guozhen and 47 others, 24 directors, 7 supervisors, and 26 consultants were elected.</p>

<p>With the appropriate supply from the Central Bank, the price of gold is becoming more stable. Jianghai Customs recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance, issuing Announcement No. 71, stipulating that all capital imports must be verified with passports issued by the Ministry before being released. Strict restrictions are also imposed on passengers carrying gold jewelry into the country. This is another important measure taken by the government to strengthen gold control. The Jianghai Customs announcement is recorded as follows: "Having received an order from the Ministry of Finance, henceforth, all gold imports must be verified with passports issued by the Ministry before being released. Passengers carrying gold jewelry into the country shall be inspected and released in accordance with the following regulations: (a) Gold jewelry refers to objects that have the shape of ornaments and are made entirely or partially of gold. (b) The gold jewelry is indeed intended for the passenger's current personal wear or for personal use. (c) The total amount of pure gold contained in the gold jewelry must not exceed 37.7994 grams. If the amount exceeds this, all gold or gold jewelry carried should be detained and reported to the Ministry for verification. This is hereby announced for compliance."</p>

<p>During the meeting, they exchanged views on journalistic affairs. Norman Corwin visited China Electric yesterday.</p>
<p>The standing committee directors of the Shanghai Journalists Association, Feng Youzhen, Chen Xunlian, Zhan Wenhun, Ma Shuli, Yuan Yeyu, and others, hosted a banquet last night at the New Asia Restaurant on Nanjing Road to welcome the American radio writer Norman Corwin. During the banquet, they exchanged many views on journalistic work. They discussed how reporters sent to foreign countries for news coverage often lack a thorough understanding of the national conditions and political situations of those countries, leading to misunderstandings during news gathering and potentially inaccurate reports being published, causing adverse effects. Mr. Corwin expressed great concern about this issue, advocating that when news organizations in various countries send reporters to work abroad, they should establish an examination body to conduct appropriate examinations for the assigned reporters. The examination subjects should include the history, geography, language, writing system, political situation, customs, and diplomatic relations with the reporter's home country. Only after passing this examination should they be permitted to be sent abroad, which would prevent the aforementioned situations from occurring.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after hosting reporters on the morning of the 24th, Norman Corwin, the first recipient of the "One World" award and an American radio writer, drove to the general management office of the Central Film Studio on Haig Road at 3 PM, visiting the studio's director, Luo Xuelian. Mr. Luo immediately introduced him to the studio's directing committee members, Zhang Junxiang, Wu Yonggang, Chen Liting, and others for discussions. As the film "Distant Love" was being filmed on the lawn of the general management office, he was accompanied by the director of the Second Studio, Xu Suling, and others to observe the filming process for a considerable time. Mr. Corwin expressed great admiration for the content of the film. After the visit, he invited the film's actors Zhao Dan, Tai Yi, and Wu Yin to the director's office for an impromptu radio recording. He left at 6 PM, expressing to reporters that he was deeply impressed by the achievements of Chinese cinema amidst hardship and the diligent spirit of Mr. Luo, greatly admiring them.</p>

<p>Wan Molin was suddenly detained by the Garrison Headquarters due to the grain loan case. It is said that during the Anti-Japanese War, Wan was ordered to work underground in Shanghai, contacting special central personnel. He was arrested twice by the enemy and puppets, suffering various tortures, sacrificing himself, and remaining unyielding. His creative contributions were significant, as deeply known by Jiang Bocheng, Wu Kaixian, Wu Shaozhu, and others. To this day, his wounds are still festering, requiring daily medical treatment. Wan is known to be loyal. His involvement in the grain loan case, leading to his implication, is perhaps due to being deceived by others. People in society deeply regret this. It is said that influential figures in society earnestly hope that the authorities, before the case is adjudicated, will consider his past merits and grant him bail for medical treatment to show compassion.</p>

<h3 id="e65">The Zoo is Desolate; Due to Man-Made Disasters and Natural Calamities, Birds and Animals are Scattered; Alligators are Killed; Many Peacocks Die Young <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Zoo was once extremely prosperous under the management of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. The zoo was systematic in the feeding environment, hygiene, death replacement, and the collection of new species. However, after the Japanese invasion of the concessions, it was completely destroyed. The managers were mostly incompetent, some even slaughtering and eating the animals they were supposed to be feeding, resulting in the zoo having few animals left after several years. Tigers, leopards, and birds had all disappeared. After the victory, the total number of animals in Shanghai's parks was extremely small. When the zoo was taken over, the few animals from various parks were gathered in the zoo at Zhongshan Park. Three alligators, a pair of golden pheasants, and a mouflon were added. The personnel in charge of the zoo currently find the low level of tourist behavior the most difficult to handle. Although there are signs in the park prohibiting teasing the animals, and a park patrol is assigned to monitor, tourists still disregard the rules and ignore warnings. This is especially true of soldiers. Two of the alligators in the park were killed by soldiers using large stones. Furthermore, the animal shelters are old and dilapidated, exposed to the sun and rain, making the animals susceptible to death. This spring, the zoo hatched five peacocks, but unfortunately, they were met with continuous rainy days. Although they were placed indoors, they could not escape the wind and rain and died one after another. Also, another mouflon broke through the fence at night and escaped through the broken part of the fence. After it was discovered, more than ten people were sent to search for it, spending three or four days, but without success. In addition, ten monkeys, dogs, elk, deer, and other animals taken over are still alive and well. Currently, the most urgent task for the zoo is the repair of the buildings. It is said that an application has been submitted to the municipal government for funding.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Elimination of Opium in the City Can Be Completed in One Year <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Municipal Police Bureau was ordered to severely eliminate opium, it had already decided to set the end of April this year as the deadline for the registration of opium addicts in the city and to limit them to automatic abstinence within two months. At that time, there were more than 300 arrests of those who failed to register and were caught, and movie stars Yuan Meiyun and Xia Peizhen also spent time behind bars as a result. As of the end of April this year, a total of 6,060 opium addicts were registered with the bureau. According to the principle of abstinence within two months, they should have reformed themselves by the end of June. In order to thoroughly eliminate drugs, the police bureau has ordered each sub-bureau, starting in July, to strictly arrest opium addicts who privately smoke opium, and to conduct inspections of these reformed opium addicts. It is learned that the police bureau inspected 355 people last month. Starting this month, the work will be further strengthened. According to the authorities, the elimination of opium in the city can be completed by the end of October next year.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Lovers Attempt Double Suicide; Man Jumps from Building; Woman Takes Poison <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At 2:15 AM yesterday, at Room 504 of the Asia Hotel at No. 135 Zhongzheng East Road, two young men and women suddenly committed suicide. The man, Liang Jin (31 years old, from Shandong), was formerly a waiter at the Gonghechang Shenzhuang at No. 212 Guangdong Road and is currently unemployed. Liang and the woman, Yang Lanfen (25 years old, from the same hometown), had known each other since childhood. After growing up, Liang came to Shanghai to work, while Yang was married to someone by her parents' arrangement. A few years ago, Yang's mother's family moved to Shanghai (No. 4 Hongyunfang, Lane 94, Ninghai West Road), and Lanfen also came to Shanghai with her husband because it was not easy to rent a house, temporarily residing at her mother's place. A month ago, Liang and Lanfen unexpectedly encountered each other somewhere, overwhelmed with joy and pouring out their hearts to each other, revealing their long-standing affection. As a result, they frequently visited each other, their love flourishing. At that time, Yang's husband was suffering from a chronic illness and had returned to his hometown for treatment a year ago. Therefore, the two of them often secretly rented rooms and had intimate conversations. However, this clandestine affair was not a long-term solution. After several discussions, they borrowed a room at the Asia Hotel the night before and committed double suicide. Liang, taking advantage of the late and quiet night, jumped from the fifth floor, dying on the spot. The woman swallowed Amyrone cream in advance and was also poisoned. After being discovered by the waiter, the Huangpu Sub-bureau was notified, and personnel were dispatched to send her to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that she is out of danger.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Jewish Swindler Exposed <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Jiang Lutang, 42 years old, from Zhejiang, general manager of Hua Ying Enterprise Company at No. 40 Hong Kong Road, ordered 1,000 rolls of American oil felt from Lianying Company at No. 102 Central Building on February 14, with a payment of US$5,502.27. At that time, it was agreed that the goods would be delivered by the end of April, but after a delay of six months, no goods had arrived in Shanghai. Last month, Jiang negotiated with the company's manager, a Jewish man named Quinsburg, and the result was an agreement to refund the payment, signing an August 22 date ticket for a beneficial bank, equivalent to 20.85 million legal tender. At that time, the deputy manager, Braun Locke, also wrote a guarantee stating that the ticket would not be dishonored on the due date. However, when the ticket was presented for collection, it was dishonored due to insufficient funds. The plaintiff reported the situation to the Huangpu Police Bureau, who detained Quinsburg for interrogation. He admitted to issuing the check indiscriminately. It is reported that he will be transferred to the District Attorney's Office this morning for investigation.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Shi Zhaolang, 22 years old, from Chongming, opened a Shi Wanxing Gluten Noodle Shop at No. 71 Fuxing East Road (i.e., Heping Road) in the Old Fourth Gate and also served as a volunteer policeman. On July 15, a man named Tang Hongping (27 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 2, Lane 263, Fuxing Middle Road) came to Shi with a document in the name of Lin Zhengdao, saying, "I was sent by the Garrison Headquarters, and someone has secretly reported that you are suspected of being a Communist sympathizer." Shi was greatly frightened and pleaded with him. Tang immediately extorted 2 million yuan as a reward. After several negotiations, it was reduced to 500,000 yuan, with payment agreed to be made on the 6th of this month. At that time, Shi only gave 200,000 yuan, with the remainder agreed to be paid on the 25th. Tang then gave this document to Shi, instructing him to handle it carefully. After Shi obtained the document, he examined it carefully for a long time and began to notice loopholes, determining that it was a forgery. By yesterday morning, knowing that Tang would definitely come to collect the money, he deliberately prepared a banquet to wait. At noon, Tang did arrive, and Shi welcomed him and treated him like a guest of honor, while secretly ordering people to report to the Penglai Police Sub-bureau. Yao Qihong, Chief of the sub-bureau, ordered Yao Yuanlong, head of the second section, Liang Shaochang, policeman, Wang Dianxiang, and Shan Zhendong to disguise themselves and rush to the scene. As the wine reached the third round, when they raised their cups to drink heartily, they immediately seized him, took him to the bureau for interrogation, and learned that he had a handgun and handcuffs in his residence. The police then went to his home to search, and as a result, they found a pair of handcuffs and another forged document, also in the name of Lin Zhengdao. The document contained the words "Presented to Chen, Commander-in-Chief of the Political Department of the 48th Army." After interrogation, Tang confessed that he had attempted to blackmail Cai Zhihong, owner of Cai Hongji Hardware Store at No. 2 Yifengli, Niuzhuang Road, by accusing him of aiding the enemy during the puppet regime in order to extort money, but because he had sought Cai Zhihong twice without success, and Cai had also moved elsewhere, he did not achieve his goal.</p>

<p>Jingan District Scheduled to Implement in September or October</p>
<p>Recently, it has been widely rumored that the city will universally implement the police district system starting on September 1. In order to clarify the truth, a reporter from the East China News Agency visited the person in charge of the Municipal Police Bureau and was told that the citywide implementation of the police district system is currently limited by manpower and cannot be achieved immediately. Furthermore, the 380 police recruits trained by the Municipal Police Training Institute have been assigned to the Huangpu, Old Gate, New City, Taishan, and General Bureau for internships to enhance their service effectiveness. The internship period is one month. After the internship period expires, those with excellent performance will be transferred to the Jingan District to carry out police district tasks. The date for the official implementation in Jingan District is expected to be in late September or early October.</p>

<h3 id="e79">The Public Concession Hospital After Takeover: Improving Facilities to Meet Growing Service Demands <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>By chance, I visited the Public Concession Hospital, which the Health Bureau took over in recent years. The hospital was founded in 1864, funded by foreign officials and civilians at the time. The original location was a rented building on the Bund outside the former French Concession. It was not until twelve years later that a new hospital building was constructed on the current site – west of the Baidu Bridge on Suzhou Creek – and its scale gradually established. Traditionally, the hospital's affairs were entirely handled by the board of directors. Last September, the Municipal Health Bureau appointed Dr. Zhu Yanggao to take over the hospital and, based on the existing system, drafted measures for the integration of the old and new boards. The board consisted of eleven members: two British expatriates in Shanghai, two American expatriates in Shanghai, four medical experts, and three respected local figures, including one Chinese and one foreign custodian director each. Later, Mayor Wu, after careful study of the hospital's organizational structure, believed that the previously drafted board organization methods were still not perfect and should be revised. This is currently being planned, and the new board of directors of the hospital may be formally established in the near future.</p>
<p>Under the persistent and diligent efforts of Dr. Zhu Yanggao – the current hospital director – the hospital, which was once in a precarious state, is now on a path of prosperity. In the past, the Public Concession Hospital only provided convenience to foreigners. If Chinese citizens wanted to enter, they could only stay in first-class wards and had to adhere to British and American lifestyles. Now, of course, only illness is considered, regardless of nationality, and Chinese and foreigners are treated equally. Previously, there were only 200 beds and only the director and one resident physician. Now, the number of beds has been expanded to 300, and physicians in all departments have been fully hired. No treatment requires the assistance of outside doctors. In addition, storerooms filled with sundries have been cleaned up, more than ten outpatient departments have been opened, empty houses next to the hospital and the residences of workers have been reorganized, and a separate infectious disease hospital has been opened. All of this has developed within a short period! In the past, the hospital's total expenditure required subsidies from the old Public Works Department of 30 to 40 percent. Today, with the expanded scope of services, the hospital can be completely self-sufficient financially. Even during the most difficult period of takeover and reorganization, it only borrowed 500,000 yuan from the Health Bureau, but this was quickly repaid. The rest relied on private mediation and expansion of business to compensate for costs, never relying on government subsidies.</p>
<p>To be mindful of the difficult living conditions of public officials, they first established measures to provide preferential treatment to public officials. In addition to semi-obligatory physical examinations (with all necessary tests, costing only 4,000 yuan), hospitalization, outpatient services, and treatment costs are all discounted. At the same time, ordinary citizens are given special preference, with one hundred beds in each department designated for ordinary citizens, costing 5,000 yuan per day. There is also a completely free quota for the extremely poor. In addition, at the beginning of the victory, when Allied soldiers were involved in traffic accidents, the authorities specifically asked the hospital to assist in treating the injured, and the number of people treated and healed reached several hundred. The fees charged were exceptionally low. The hospital also specially established an emergency department, providing services day and night, due to the dense population in the urban area and the frequent occurrence of injuries or emergencies. Furthermore, to cultivate a new generation of talent, outstanding medical school students are specially selected to intern at the hospital. All of this represents new contributions since the takeover.</p>
<p>The hospital director warmly welcomed me and accompanied me on a tour of the entire hospital, starting from the top floor, not even missing the kitchen and bathroom. Although I am an outsider, after detailed explanations, I was also fascinated by the highest realms reached by modern science and gained a lot of knowledge. For example, the row of operating rooms, including one equipped for urethral surgery, is said to be the most advanced and unique in Shanghai. In addition, the newly painted hospital buildings, the neatness and cleanliness, the diligence of the staff, the solemn atmosphere, and the orderliness are all things that even an outsider can appreciate.</p>
<p>Director Zhu has no sense of complacency regarding such achievements. He is planning and determined to greatly expand the hospital in order to achieve the same level of a complete hospital as those in Europe and America. At the same time, they also expressed that if the hospital's finances become more stable in the future, they also hope to reduce the general fee standards; although they are already lower than the Hong En Hospital of similar scale.

<h3 id="e80">Believe It or Not: The Bank of China's Grand Vault, Magnificent in Scale, Unmatched in the World: Layers of Steel Plates Unafraid of Artillery Fire, Intricate Mechanisms Impassable to a Drop of Water <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Believe it or not, the vault with the most boxes and the largest scale in the world is located in the basement of the Bank of China Building on the Bund. In this vault, the total number of boxes, large and small, including five vaults, is 11,193. It is said that the largest bank vault in the United States only has more than 8,000 boxes.</p>
<p>The reporter, guided by Mr. Cai Yimin, the director of the bank's custody department, toured the inside and outside of this giant vault. First, we took the elevator directly to the basement. Opening the door, we entered a small square glass room. This is the first room for customers entering the vault. The three glass walls are all one and a half inches thick and made of bulletproof glass. They are fitted together with thick steel channels. People inside and outside can only see each other and cannot transmit sound. In the middle of the glass wall, there is a very small steel trough and a pure steel speaking tube. When customers enter, they must first show their credentials at the trough and speak into the tube. After approval, they enter the first door.</p>
<p>The second door is the most complex and largest vault door. This door, including the frame, weighs 45 tons. It is entirely made of non-melting steel. However, the two door pivots are each covered with more than ten layers of steel ball bearings, so the door's rotation is exceptionally flexible. A single person can move it with very little effort.</p>
<p>The door's exterior is round, with a thickness of about two feet. The door's perimeter is fitted with 24 bolts. By simply turning the dial in front of the door, these 24 bolts extend together, resembling a gear, inserted into the slots of the door frame. This locks the door.</p>
<p>Speaking of the door's opening and closing, there are two extremely complex combination dials. In addition, there are four small clocks. These are usually calibrated with the time. The door can only be opened after the combination dials are aligned and the small clocks reach the calibrated time. For example, the Bank of China vault's usual business hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. They calibrate the four small clocks according to this time in advance. Therefore, even if the combination dials are aligned, one must wait until 9:00 AM to open the door. This precise door-opening design (1) prevents people who know the combination from opening the door and entering at midnight or after business hours; (2) prevents bandits from coercing bank employees to open the door at midnight.</p>
<p>The door's surface layer is filled with gas. If someone tries to secretly drill through the door, the gas will come out when they just drill through the first layer, causing the person drilling to faint for more than ten hours, but not fatally. Water cannot enter this door when it is closed normally. However, there is a fail-safe mechanism: the door slot is filled with a layer of [gap], which automatically expands upon contact with water, immediately [sealing] any possible gaps in the door.</p>
<p>After passing through this complex vault door, and then through a simpler steel gate, one finally enters the vault room. There are five sizes of safe deposit boxes, densely arranged in neat rows. The smallest boxes are on the upper layers, and the boxes become larger closer to the bottom layers. Between the rows, there are corridors covered with oiled felt. The vault's lighting uses specially designed fluorescent tubes. They are inlaid in a row along the upper edge of each section, and the light is extremely soft and pleasant.</p>
<p>The outer wall of each box is made of half-inch thick pure steel plate. Opening a box requires passing through three locks. The box has two keyholes. To open the box, the customer's key and the vault's master key must be inserted at the same time. After opening the box and taking out the contents, there is another lock, which the customer opens themselves.</p>
<p>In addition to the five sizes of safe deposit boxes, there are also five vaults the size of ordinary elevator shafts, intended for storing large quantities of items. If the items are too large, the customer can seal the original items and hand them over to the vault for storage as is, and the vault will issue a receipt. These originally sealed items are stored in a "vault within a vault."</p>
<p>Originally, the vault itself, except for the ceiling and floor, is sealed with dense layers of steel plates. The surrounding walls are two feet thick. The inner and outer layers are extremely thick steel plates. The inner layer's structure is entirely made of reinforced concrete, steel mesh, steel plates, and other composite materials. Outside this layer of walls, separated by a corridor about four feet wide, is the bank's outermost wall. The inner wall of this layer is covered with thick and thin electric wires. Patrol officers patrol this narrow corridor day and night. The so-called "vault within a vault" is a small vault with two-foot-thick walls constructed within this vault.</p>
<p>The vault room has the latest airflow and temperature equipment. The vault's temperature is maintained at 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit year-round, with air conditioning in hot weather and heating in snowy weather. The entry and exit of airflow have specific routes. Therefore, although the vault is firmly located in a steel-walled underground cellar, the air is no different from the outside, but the temperature is much more comfortable. This airflow and temperature equipment will definitely not cause the stored items to corrode or become moldy. The reporter could not help but wonder if the airflow inlet would become a major loophole in the vault. But no! The airflow inlet also has a dedicated control room, which also has that complex door that must be opened with a combination. Air can circulate, but one cannot cross the line using this.</p>
<p>The raw materials for this vault came from the York Safe and Lock Company in the United States. It is said that there is also a similar vault with the same design, but smaller in scale, in a bank in Manila, Philippines. During the scorched-earth battle in the Philippines, this bank's building was completely destroyed, but this vault remained intact. In addition, the Bank of China's Hongkou branch also has a small vault with the same design. During the enemy occupation, the Japanese spent much effort trying to open it, but ultimately failed. Therefore, the items stored in the vault before the war remained untouched after the victory. This is a miracle in the history of safe deposit boxes. If you want to enjoy this miracle, simply apply for the smallest safe deposit box from the Bank of China's trust department. This is a permanent [solution] for the valuable property that the general public can afford.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Education Loan Committee, the Student Union, the Scholarship Joint Association, and the Love National Products Movement Committee are organizing a domestic products market starting September 1st to raise education loans to rescue young people who have dropped out of school. The event will last five days and is scheduled to end on [date]. The site is located inside the Ba Xian Qiao Franco-Chinese Middle School and will consist of five departments: (1) Domestic Products Department: Various manufacturers will set up booths to sell goods and [aid] scholarships. (2) Charity Sale Department: Students will collect goods and donate all proceeds from the charity sale to the loan fund. (3) Service Department: Responsible by Tongde [University], specializing in checking the body of guests, etc., and the service fees collected will also be used for scholarships. (4) Entertainment Department: Contracted by external parties, charging rental fees. (5) Exhibition Department: Displaying the manufacturing process of goods, students' academic achievements, etc. All transactions within the market will use discount coupons, and the proceeds from the sale of goods, after the manufacturers recover their costs, will be donated to the loan fund. It is estimated that after all 3 billion yuan worth of goods are sold, the income will be close to 1 billion yuan. The discount coupons are divided into five denominations: 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 50,000 yuan. They will be distributed to various school recruitment teams starting today to promote sales widely.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Education Loan Committee convened a meeting of domestic product manufacturers yesterday (the 25th) morning. Attendees included Chen Ruhui, Hu Boxiang, Shen Mengshi, Jiang Zhonghe, etc. It was agreed that participating manufacturers should deliver goods before the 28th of this month for arrangement, and Shen Mengshi was elected as the general manager of the market on the spot. As of now, the manufacturers registered to participate include Lixing Thermos Factory, Family Industrial Cooperative, Jingfu Shirt and Socks Factory, Yifeng Enamel Factory, China Chemical Industrial Cooperative, Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, Zhongfa Pharmacy, Kailin Food Factory, and 18 other companies. According to Chen Ruhui, Chairman of the Loan Committee, in addition to the domestic products market, a charity sale market will also be set up inside Aurora University. This charity sale market will be entirely supplied and managed by students themselves. The discount coupons distributed so far have reached more than 1 billion yuan, but are still far from the target of 3 billion. In order to encourage students to promote sales, it is specifically stipulated that those who sell more than 500,000 yuan are guaranteed 50% of their tuition fees, and those who sell more than 1 million yuan can get all their tuition fees, meaning that students receiving relief should also rise up to help, not just enjoy the benefits. It is also learned that the Loan Committee has now mobilized students citywide to carry out a large-scale campaign. The discount coupons for the domestic products market set up for the loan fund were already being promoted by 40 small teams in major entertainment venues at 5 PM yesterday.

However, the detailed specific methods are still under consideration. At the same time, due to the excessive cost, it may first trial run 10 to 20 mobile vehicles, and expand the program if the results are good.</p>
<p>Another report: Ying Yongyu, executive director of the Shanghai Children's Library, sent a letter to the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday, requesting the ban of [harmful] illustrations and [suggesting] the addition of mobile library [vehicles], which would rotate daily on various roads, providing free reading for citizens to supplement the lack of spiritual food.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Shanghai Student Association Issues Declaration Protesting Tuition Hikes <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Student Association, to protest tuition increases, issued a declaration yesterday (the 25th). The content is as follows: Fellow students, as the start of the semester approaches, we were suddenly hit with the news of rising tuition fees, which sends shivers down our spines. Education profiteers, disregarding the government's national policy, the education authorities' orders, the burden on parents, and the students' studies, have decided to drastically increase tuition, threatening us and forcing many students to drop out. If we students do not resist and protest this rash action ourselves, the consequences will be even more unimaginable. In order to save the current education crisis and seek the welfare of all students, we dare to propose the following solutions, hoping that people in the education sector will adopt them. First, we urge the school authorities to calculate tuition fees based on the ratio of commodity prices, and not to increase tuition fees arbitrarily and groundlessly based solely on subjective assumptions. We hope they will consider the financial burden on students' parents and the difficulty of paying tuition fees at once, and adjust tuition fees reasonably under the principle of open school finances and balanced budgets each semester, and formulate installment payment methods to reduce the burden on parents. Second, we demand that each school set up at least 20% of tuition-free places to solve the problem of school dropout for poor students. Third, we demand that the government and education authorities impose effective sanctions on schools that unreasonably raise tuition fees, and at the same time, according to the actual situation, provide subsidies and rewards to schools that are well-managed, in order to guide the education sector to strive for progress and eradicate the spread of the vulgar commercialism. Fourth, we urge all sectors to effectively assist the educational loan movement and donate large sums of money to help truly poor students continue their studies and avoid being threatened by rising tuition fees. Fellow students! For our own studies and for the studies of our brothers and sisters in the future, we should resolutely oppose the bureaucratic practices of the education sector and overthrow the vulgar commercialism that treats schools as markets and students as commodities. However, these are only passive measures. We should actively seek our own welfare and reduce the chance of dropping out of school. Now, our student association is cooperating with the Educational Loan Association to promote the student loan movement, hoping to solve our own problem of dropping out of school with our own strength. However, the success of the work still requires the joint efforts of all students. Those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. On the one hand, we must oppose tuition increases, and on the other hand, we must make advance arrangements for poor students to overcome the difficulties of rising tuition together! We firmly advocate: (1) Oppose unreasonable increases in huge tuition fees! (2) Oppose one-time payment! (3) Demand that schools make their finances public, improve teachers' salaries, save expenses as much as possible, reduce the burden on parents, and oppose private school principals manipulating finances for personal gain! (4) Demand that schools set up more tuition-free places! (5) Demand that the government allocate special funds to develop education and increase opportunities for compatriots to study! (6) Demand that the government effectively assist and promote the educational loan movement!</p>

Tao finally won with a score of 6-4.</p>

Carson won the first and third sets with a score of 6-4, and the second set was a grueling 26 games before a winner was decided, which was unexpected. The entire match lasted about two and a half hours, which shows the intensity of the competition. Carson's deep shots, short shots, net play, and overhead smashes were all excellent, and his backhand was flawless. Wang Wenzheng was indeed inferior. In the first set, Carson took the lead with 5-2, Wang chased to 5-4, and Carson won another game. In the second set, Carson again took the lead with 5-4, but the next serve was lost, and then the score was 5-5, and it was difficult to distinguish between them.

<h3 id="e102">Household Registration Regulations, Questions and Answers (Continued) <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>(38) Question: When registering for the first time, applicants often use nicknames, which do not match the names on their qualification certificates. How should they apply for correction?</p>
<p>Answer: The qualification certificate should be used to request that the nickname on the household registration book be changed.</p>
<p>(39) Question: For a certain business household, half of the registered residents are natives and half are temporary residents. Should they be registered separately at the time of registration, and should the parent column of the household registration book and the temporary registration book be filled in?</p>
<p>Answer: When a certain business household has both native and temporary residents, they should be registered separately, and the person with the status of parent should be filled in the parent column of the registration book.</p>
<p>(40) Question: Articles 8 and 9 of the Household Registration Law stipulate that for temple households and relief agency households, the years of residence of the resident religious believers and the fostered persons without or with unclear native places are inconsistent. If no native or temporary registration is set, what should be used as a basis?</p>
<p>Answer: Article 8 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that the monks and other religious believers of temples are different. The time of residence should be based on the nationality of their supervisors to apply for registration. Article 9 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that the fostered persons without or with unclear native places in relief agencies should be compiled into one household if they have not lived for three years and apply for temporary registration. Those who have lived for more than three years should apply for native registration separately.</p>
<p>(41) Question: How should the transfer of religious believers from temple households be handled?</p>
<p>Answer: Registration of establishment and cancellation can be done directly.</p>
<p>(42) Question: The latter part of Article 5 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that "one person shall not have two temporary registrations at the same time." Does this stipulation mean that if a person already has a temporary registration in another county, even if he has lived in this county for six months, he cannot set up a temporary registration again without going through the transfer registration procedure? Or if a person has lived in this county for six months, he must set up a temporary registration, and the temporary registration must be cancelled if he already has a temporary registration in other counties and cities?</p>
<p>Answer: According to Articles 41 and 44 of the Household Registration Law, the chief of household registration in the original temporary registration place and the new temporary registration place should be asked to apply for cancellation and transfer registrations respectively.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Vegetables and Local Produce: North and South Markets Established, Daily Turnover Approximately 70 Million Yuan, Procurement from Outside the City Besides Vegetable Vendors <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Vegetable and Local Produce Sales Joint Venture Market, South Shanghai District Market, held its inaugural meeting yesterday at 2 PM at the Ningbo Native Place Association. Eighty-four members attended and mutually elected Shen Qichao as the temporary chairman. After the customary formalities, the chairman delivered a speech and reported on the preparations, stating that the formation of the market had been fraught with difficulties. Fortunately, with the efforts of colleagues and the assistance and guidance of the municipal authorities and the Social Affairs Bureau, preparations were successfully completed. The vegetable and local produce industry in the city has faced operational difficulties since the dissolution of the Shanghai Agricultural Products Market. Before the war, businesses had their own sites, buildings, docks, and other facilities, most of which were destroyed during the war. During the enemy puppet regime, they were forced to concentrate operations in the "Central Market." After the victory, the "Central Market" was taken over by the Agricultural Products Market. After the Agricultural Products Market was dissolved, the industry suddenly lost a large, centralized operating area, and operations could not be developed.</p>
<p>Market Establishment Process</p>
<p>Subsequently, the industry in various districts jointly petitioned the city government for relief. On June 24th of this year, the city government responded, expressing sympathy for the request and approving the provisional organization of a joint venture market. On July 5th, the Social Affairs Bureau approved the filing. Now, the South District Market has been successfully established. In the future, the development of operations will rely on the cooperation of all vendors. Efforts will be made to stabilize vegetable and local produce prices while safeguarding the costs of farmers and the legitimate profits of vendors. Subsequently, Wu Hanbang, the supervisor stationed at the market by the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered a speech. Finally, thirty-one articles of association were passed, and directors and supervisors were elected. According to the result, Qi Sipin, Shen Qichao, Qi Pinpu, Dong Xiaocheng, Tang Yongchang, Wu Baocheng, Zhang Shouren, Sheng Rongjin, Yan Muyun, Tang Muxiang, and Ma Wenbiao were elected as directors, while Zhang Xiaofang, Wang Yueting, and Bu Ruqiao were elected as supervisors. Jiang Wenhuan and Lu Wenbao were elected as alternate directors, and Gong Pinmei was elected as an alternate supervisor. The meeting then adjourned. Immediately afterwards, the first meeting of the directors and supervisors was held, and Qi Sipin was elected as chairman, with Shen Qichao, Dong Xiaocheng, Zhang Shouren, and Ma Wenbiao as managing directors. Shen Qichao was appointed as the market manager, and Ma Wenbiao as the deputy manager.</p>
<p>To Operate in Three Districts</p>
<p>The North Shanghai District Market was established as early as July 20th. The chairman is Jin Weiyu, the market manager is Pan Yijun, and the deputy manager is Shen Wenbin. Currently, under the structure of the Shanghai Vegetable and Local Produce Industry Sales Joint Venture Market, the established district markets are the South Shanghai and North Shanghai districts. The West District is still being organized. The South District currently has ninety-five members. The area includes Dongjiadu, Huangjia Wharf, Dama Wharf, the Sixteenth Settlement, and the Huangpu Bund Road area. The market address is 60 Limalu, Nanshi. The North District has one hundred and twenty members. The area includes Lao Zha, Touba, Xin Zha, and Caojiadu, etc. The market address is 21 Xizang North Road. Any member merchant of the Shanghai Vegetable and Local Produce Industry Guild, certified by the respective industry guild, may join as a joint venture merchant.</p>
<p>Membership is Not Mandatory</p>
<p>However, membership is not compulsory. The operating principle of the merchants is to purchase local products from outside the city, such as Suzhou and Wuxi, to supplement the insufficiency of vegetables produced in the four suburban areas of Shanghai. Therefore, merchants often provide loans to farmers in various rural areas when seeds are planted to supplement seeds, raw materials, and various equipment. After the crops are ripe, they are handed over to the merchants for sale. This is the main business of the merchants.</p>
<p>According to several leading figures at the meeting, vegetables and local produce are different from other goods in nature. (1) They are easily perishable and cannot be stockpiled. (2) Repeated handling and transportation are labor-intensive and result in a lot of damage. Therefore, the market price at the vegetable markets must be slightly higher than that of the market. The price of ordinary vegetables depends on the amount of supply. For example, recently, due to the hot and dry weather, the amount of vegetables has decreased, which is a common occurrence from May to September every year. Therefore, the market price of general vegetables is inevitably more expensive. However, once vegetable production returns to normal, prices will fall. Regarding commissions, merchants in the city take 3% from the vendors and 3% from the stallholders. It is said that this commission rate is lower than in other places. Currently, the daily turnover of the North and South District Markets is approximately 70 million yuan. It has not been heard that vegetable vendors from the four suburban areas of Shanghai have been forcibly detained along the way to weigh their goods. If this happens, the market will appeal to the relevant authorities to effectively stop it. As for the market location problems in the North and South Districts, it is now possible to find ways to solve them one by one. Regarding the sheds, the Agricultural Products Market Clearance Office has requested the municipal government and the Social Affairs Bureau to jointly assess the prices, and the merchants will raise funds to purchase them. Regarding the market sites, as most of them are owned by private landlords, the merchants will separately enter into contracts with them to decide whether to lease or purchase them.</p>

<p>After the exchange rate adjustment, which caused price fluctuations, the Sailboat brand paint produced by Wanli Paint Factory, in support of national policy, maintained its original price and jointly issued a public notice with other paint companies to lead the way. Dong Risen, the person in charge of the factory, is one of the standing directors of the Paint Industry Guild. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the blind price increase of domestic tung oil.</p>

<p>Since the exchange rate adjustment last Monday, the market has fluctuated sharply. In addition to imported goods, native products and daily necessities that are generally considered unrelated to foreign exchange have also risen one after another. Although some goods have not increased in price on the surface due to various reasons, the black market has risen sharply, which has become an open fact. Some goods have increased sharply and then decreased slightly, while others have initially remained stable and then gradually increased. The following table lists the highest and lowest prices of major commodities on Saturday of the previous week (before the exchange rate was adjusted), Saturday of last week, and during last week (after the exchange rate had been adjusted) for reference.

<p>Tea Sales to the US Mostly Old Tea, No Agreement Yet on Barter Trade with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>China tea industry insiders are not optimistic about the export situation of Chinese tea after the exchange rate adjustment. According to industry insiders, the US and the Soviet Union, the main markets for Chinese tea exports, are still disputing the price and quality of Chinese tea. Regarding barter trade with the Soviet Union, the China Trust Bureau has held discussions with the Soviet commercial delegation in Shanghai. The Soviet Union then sent an expert to Shanghai to be responsible for tea. The proposed price is based on the New York Chinese tea market price. The China Trust Bureau believes that the New York tea market is the price of old tea. If you want to buy new tea this year, the cost of origin must be added. The Soviet side has not agreed to this so far, which has led to the delay in tea sales to the Soviet Union. If the deadlock cannot be broken, there is little hope for Chinese tea sales to the Soviet Union this year. As for the United States, the price limit for tea is USD 0.57 for the highest grade of black tea, which is only 1,900 yuan in legal tender, and USD 0.485 for the highest grade of green tea, which is 1,620 yuan in legal tender. The current export price of new tea is at least 2,400 yuan per catty, a difference of as much as 50%. Therefore, tea merchants have not yet considered the export of new tea. Currently, Chinese tea sold to the United States is all old tea.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Exchange of Goods Between Within and Outside the Customs Gradual Smoothing, Provisional Measures for Remittances in the Nine Northeastern Provinces <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Pan Yang, 25th] Since the announcement and implementation on the 16th of the regulations for the exchange of goods within and outside the customs and commercial and industrial remittances, the number of applications for goods transportation registration has been considerable, but due to recent military transportation relations, it has not yet started. In terms of commercial and industrial remittances, negotiations are underway with the Bank of China on procedures. It will start after the agreement is reached. According to the report of the Central Bank Jian Guan Branch, the exchange of goods within and outside the customs from May to July shows that imports are more than exports. After the lifting of the grain transportation ban, the main import goods were grain, followed by soybean cake, hardware, aluminum products, hemp paper, with a total value of over 34.8 billion yuan in national currency. Exports include foreign goods, cigarettes, sugar, saccharin, flour, cloth, tea, matches, etc., with a total value of over 12.43 billion yuan in national currency. It is estimated that the foreign goods smuggled out of the customs exceed this number by two times. In stores in Shenyang, Changchun, and other places, there are already American goods such as glass raincoats and handbags. As for American cigarettes, they have long been filled with the streets and alleys of various cities. After the restoration of the Northeast, the goods and odds and ends sold by the Japanese have now become a thing of the past. As for local industrial products, they are still insignificant.</p>
<p>The Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, in order to facilitate commercial transportation and open up remittances, has specially formulated the Provisional Implementation Measures for Commercial and Industrial Remittances in the Nine Northeastern Provinces, the original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1. These Measures are formulated in accordance with the Provisional Measures for the Management of Remittances in the Nine Northeastern Provinces promulgated by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Article 2. All legitimate industrialists and businessmen who comply with the Provisional Measures for the Regulation of Commercial Goods Import and Export may apply for remittances.</p>
<p>Article 3. Commercial and industrial remittances between the Nine Northeastern Provinces and the customs are handled by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau designated by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Article 4. Industrialists and businessmen who remit money from the Nine Northeastern Provinces to the customs should apply to the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau. However, for industrial remittances of more than 1 million circulation coupons or commercial remittances of more than 500,000 circulation coupons, the remitting bank must apply to the Northeast Branch of the Joint Treasury on behalf of the applicant. After verification, a remittance notice will be issued before the exchange can be settled.</p>
<p>Article 5. Legitimate industrialists and businessmen who remit money from various places in the customs to the Nine Northeastern Provinces should first apply to the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, or the Central Trust Bureau in the local area, and only after verification can the remittance be accepted.</p>
<p>Article 6. The exchange rate between the Nine Northeastern Provinces and the mainland is announced by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Article 7. Staff members of the industrial and commercial sectors inside and outside the customs who remit money for family expenses shall handle it according to the standards approved by the Northeast Branch of the Joint Treasury.</p>
<p>Article 8. For the import of foreign bills or cash with a total value of more than 50,000 circulation coupons, the local Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, or Central Trust Bureau should be applied to on their behalf.</p>
<p>Article 9. The banks and bureaus designated by the Central Bank to handle commercial and industrial remittances shall list the remittance situation and figures at any time and report them to the Economic Committee for review.</p>
<p>Article 10. These Measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<p>[United Press, Munderley, 24th] Sir Locke, Director of the Sugar Bureau of the British Ministry of Food, reported that although the world sugar situation is gradually improving, the sugar rationing in Britain, the United States, and Canada may have to be extended to 1947.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] At the annual meeting of the China Export Commodity Exhibition held on the 24th, Everett, Honorary Secretary of the American Chamber of Commerce in this city, was invited to speak on the topic of "China's Handmade Embroidery and Lace Trade." The speech stated that high labor costs, lack of creativity, and domestic instability will cause China to lose its leading position in the export of embroidery and lace. This industry originated in Europe and flourished in France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, reaching its artistic peak in the Renaissance. The largest customer for these folk industrial products has always been the United States, almost entirely relying on foreign markets. During the First World War, the European market was destroyed by the war. With the help of church people stationed in China, the embroidery and lace industry began to develop, covering Guangzhou, Shantou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Shanghai, Wuxi, Changshu, Shaoxing, Weihaiwei, Zhifu, and Peiping. The quality of Zhifu products soon reached the same level as in Europe, but the price was lower. Therefore, the United States and the world, even after the outbreak of the war in China, still relied on the import of Chinese textiles, until the attack on Pearl Harbor, when it was terminated. During World War II, the United States mostly imported from Matla and Powderico. With low labor costs and new styles, the neat and beautiful machine-made products have almost replaced China. If China wants to recover its lost position, it must completely exempt import raw materials from taxation, reduce the parcel postage at the time of export, and create new styles. Everett concluded: "If wages do not rise, the adjustment of the exchange rate may slightly improve this situation."</p>

<p>Minsheng Company has suffered huge losses in recent years. The company's directors have advocated for closure. After General Manager Lu Zuofu spent several months traveling between Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, explaining the difficulties to the government and powerful parties and asking for ways to maintain the company, he won the sympathy and support of all parties. The company's request for a government loan has been approved by the Executive Yuan, totaling 300 million yuan. The necessary loan procedures are being handled. Therefore, the company will maintain its current status and plans to expand its business. Lu Zuofu arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the afternoon of the 24th to handle important matters and will go to the United States next month to purchase new ships and various equipment. Before going to the United States, Lu Zuofu will return to Chongqing to report to the company's board of directors.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Due to the decline in trade between China and Japan after the war, American Pacific shipping companies are now shifting their development focus to Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, as the cargo business in that region seems more promising. In the past, American Pacific shipping lines were concentrated in Japan, China, the Philippines, or India, but now they plan to expand to the region of the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, and even the Bay of Bengal.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The Chancellor of the Exchequer recently announced that he is prepared to recommend a reduction of one penny per gallon in the import tax on diesel in next year's budget bill. Before implementation, the government will temporarily subsidize diesel consumers with one pound sterling per ton.

<h3 id="e114">Commodity Tax of 45%, Cosmetics Industry Overwhelmed, Smuggled Goods Dumping, Small and Medium-sized Factories Already Bankrupt <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Hu Boxiang, chairman of the Cosmetics Industry Guild, to inquire about the impact of the exchange rate adjustment on the general national goods industry. He said that the government's determination to adjust the exchange rate will undoubtedly benefit the domestic industry a lot. He also said that the best phenomenon these days is the stability of gold prices. The increase is extremely small compared to before the exchange rate adjustment, which is commendable. However, it is hoped that the prices of food and other major industrial raw materials will not rise, so that industrial production costs can remain unchanged. Speaking of the current situation of the cosmetics industry, it has been threatened by the devaluation and dumping of foreign smuggled goods in recent months. Several small and medium-sized factories have closed down. Large factories also feel it is difficult to maintain. It is hoped that the exchange rate adjustment will remedy this unfavorable situation. In the commodity tax regulations recently issued by the central government, the tax rate for cosmetics is as high as 45%. Mr. Hu specially pointed out that most of the cosmetics produced by national goods factories are daily necessities such as soap. Over-taxation is not only unrealistic but will also destroy the development of the industry. Therefore, the board of directors convened a meeting a few days ago and submitted a request through the Industry Association to the authorities for exemption. It is reported that the products of the cosmetics industry and most of the national goods factories are usually sold mainly to the vast rural areas. Therefore, the restoration and cultivation of rural purchasing power is an urgent matter. At the same time, it is hoped that the situation will be stabilized soon and transportation will be restored as soon as possible, so that the products of national goods factories can be sold well in the mainland. As for the Nanyang market, it is still unable to export in large quantities due to the high domestic price level. Even if there is, it is mostly sporadic and experimental transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e115">China's Economy in Transition <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, tax revenues sharply decreased while expenditures frequently increased. Financial maintenance depended entirely on currency issuance. Although the exact figures were not publicly announced, financial authorities were well aware of the situation. Therefore, immediately after the victory, the focus shifted to tightening the money supply, adopting the following measures: (1) overvaluing the legal tender exchange rate to reduce currency issuance; (2) selling enemy and puppet regime assets at high prices to recover more currency; (3) allocating and selling gold to capture domestic idle capital; (4) using state monopolies of certain enterprises to increase government revenue. However, military operations had not ceased, and downsizing had not been completed, preventing the achievement of the expected results. Instead, prices and wages mutually influenced each other, and imported goods under foreign management sold well domestically. This, combined with the proportionate stimulus, made it impossible to export domestic products, creating the current precarious economic situation.</p>
<p>This is not to say that tightening the money supply is inappropriate; currency should not have been inflated in the first place. However, merely tightening the money supply only results in a shift of wealth between the government and the people, without benefiting the national economy. Nor is it to say that tightening the money supply is ineffective; after all, it did prevent a collapse similar to the German Mark and Russian Ruble. However, relying solely on tightening the money supply can only stabilize currency value temporarily and is difficult to sustain. Now that the government and the people have been competing for profits for years, the trip of representatives of industry and commerce to Beijing to petition, and the request for exporting Chinese cotton yarn, indicate that both the government and the people feel the need for a change in course. Therefore, there may be signs of a positive turn in our country's economic future.</p>
<p>How can the economy thrive alone when military and political affairs are not yet settled? However, given the alarming trade deficit and the decline of industry and commerce, we will soon see frequent bankruptcies and increasing unemployment. Therefore, we can no longer wait for the pacification of military and political affairs but must implement economic remedies immediately. In principle, we must prioritize the effectiveness of the economy and base it on the national economy. We must also reform the "revenue-only" doctrine of finance and replace it with thrift in expenditure. For the people's wealth leads to the country's wealth, and thrift enables balance. For now, let us not discuss long-term strategies. If we can only implement measures that are easy to put into action, we may be able to avert the impending collapse.</p>
<p>The American cotton obtained from the US loan, if used for textile rehabilitation and to meet domestic fabric shortages, will only alleviate unemployment temporarily and slightly relieve the accumulated hardships of the past eight years. However, US loans are not always available, and they are sufficient for emergencies but not a solution to poverty. Once the products are entirely absorbed by consumers, both foreign exchange and US cotton will be unsustainable, and this reviving textile industry will return to decline. If the products, or easily obtainable replicas such as knitwear, are exported, then when the foreign market is favorable to us, in addition to recovering the original amount of foreign exchange to purchase US cotton for continuous production, the surplus materials can both alleviate domestic shortages and be exchanged for other important raw materials to revitalize other industries. If the foreign market is unfavorable to us, then at a small cost, we can maintain the livelihood of a large number of domestic laborers and save government relief expenditures, while still maintaining the source of US cotton and foreign exchange.</p>
<p>For example, as reported, the Liuhe Yongli Company cannot produce fertilizer due to a lack of coal and coke. Fertilizer is an indispensable raw material for mountain crops. It is regrettable that the company cannot contribute to the country amidst the cries of food shortages. If the government can exchange coal for fertilizer and distribute it to mountain residents, the increase in production will reduce government relief expenditures and save foreign exchange on imported rice. If there is more to spare, exporting it to Southeast Asia can also allow domestically unnecessary coal to earn valuable foreign exchange or essential raw materials, stimulating other domestic industries. Because its cyclical production and distribution are mutually beneficial, prices can be suppressed, the cost of living can be lowered, and the costs of other agricultural and industrial products can be drastically reduced, facilitating exports.</p>
<p>Revolution is certainly not ease and comfort, and democracy certainly does not mean selfishness. Even in advanced democracies like Britain and the United States, they are still engaged in price management and resource allocation. Management and allocation do not harm democracy and are certainly not comparable to monopoly and exclusive control. The US cotton obtained by the government through loans can be evenly distributed to state-owned and private factories according to production capacity, exchanging cotton for yarn, and yarn for cloth or other knitted goods. In addition to the necessary wages, legitimate profits should also be provided. However, all products cannot be supplied to domestic consumers first but should be centrally collected by the government and exported through special permits. This is to avoid private profiteering and self-competition in foreign markets. As for other agricultural and industrial products, why can't they be done in a similar way?

<p>Taiwan, hailed as the "Sugar Kingdom," is now facing economic anxieties among its people due to the high price of sugar, an unprecedented and dreamlike situation. In the past half-century, they had never encountered anything like this. They can vividly recall the low prices of sugar not long ago:</p>
<p>Before August last year: Highest price per catty (斤, approx. 1.1 lbs): 6 jiao (角, 1/10 of a yuan)</p>
<p>After August last year: Highest price per catty: 10 yuan</p>
<p>November last year: Highest price per catty: 1.5 yuan</p>
<p>End of June this year: Highest price per catty: 20 yuan (rising by 1-2 yuan daily starting in July)</p>
<p>July 16th this year: Highest price per catty: 50 yuan (equivalent to 1,500 legal tender)</p>

<p>Taiwanese people have never felt sugar consumption to be a burden. With a population of six million requiring 40,000 tons of sugar annually, the average annual consumption per person is 7 kilograms. Looking at other parts of the world shows that consumption in Taiwan is not high:</p>
<p>Australia: Average annual sugar consumption per person: 54 kg</p>
<p>United States: Average annual sugar consumption per person: 50 kg</p>
<p>United Kingdom: Average annual sugar consumption per person: 46 kg</p>
<p>Switzerland: Average annual sugar consumption per person: 42 kg</p>
<p>Canada: Average annual sugar consumption per person: 41 kg</p>
<p>Japan: Average annual sugar consumption per person: 12 kg</p>
<p>China (Mainland): Average annual sugar consumption per person: 2 kg (Note)</p>
<p>Taiwanese sugar consumption is far less than that of the Japanese, while total sugar production once reached 1.46 million metric tons (one metric ton equals 2,000 kilograms). This massive number now threatens the sugar-producing region, which is worth studying!</p>
<p>[Note] According to a survey by the Sichuan Sugarcane Experimental Field, domestic annual production is 412,900 metric tons, and the average imported sugar volume is 688,000 metric tons, totaling 1,100,900 metric tons. This figure is used as the total annual consumption for the country.</p>
<p>Sugar Reserves After Retrocession</p>
<p>According to people in the sugar industry, the sugar reserves in Taiwan are also substantial. The total sugar reserves last year were estimated at 840,000 metric tons, of which about 330,000 metric tons were destroyed in bombing, leaving 520,000 metric tons. However, this number continued to decrease. When the Taiwan Advance Command Post was established before the Japanese surrender, the sugar reserves only had 300,000 metric tons left. After a month of supervisory period, it decreased to 240,000 metric tons, and at the time of takeover, only 150,000 metric tons were left.</p>
<p>Of these 150,000 metric tons of sugar, the government transported 20,000 metric tons to Shanghai to exchange for fertilizers and other materials. Smuggling accounted for about half of it. That means there are currently at least 50,000 metric tons left. This year's estimated production is about 86,000 metric tons, which should theoretically be enough for the province to consume for more than three years, so the price should not be so high. But in reality, it is the opposite.</p>
<p>Why is the Price of Sugar Soaring?</p>
<p>The main reasons for the soaring price of sugar in Taiwan are roughly:</p>
<p>(1) The increase in the special tax on sugar consumption. This is internal. The price adjustment on March 1st was twice that of the Japanese era, and the adjustment on June 21st increased it by another two times. In the past, the tax on 100 catties of white sugar was 17 cents and 5 li, which was increased twice to 70 cents. An additional tax is levied on amounts over 2,000 catties, and merchants collect business tax.</p>
<p>(2) Large-scale smuggling along the northwestern coast. This is a side effect of the government's measures to ban the smuggling of sugar out of the country last year. Merchants cannot plan on the new grains of the first season, so they turn to the attractive sugar, risking everything to transport it to Japan and inland.</p>
<p>(3) The prohibition of free sale of sugar within the province makes it impossible to maintain a balance between production and sales. The prices in the production areas of Tainan, Taichung, and Chiayi are 20% lower than in Taipei. But it should be noted that the markets in the production areas are full of brown sugar, while white sugar is like a sheltered maiden, not easy to buy. The sugar in the ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung is also moldy because of delayed loading and transportation.</p>
<p>These three reasons are directly determined by the stimulation of the authorities' sugar policy. Indirectly, the fact that it cannot increase production affects the psychology of the people.</p>
<p>How Much Can Taiwan Sugar Increase Production?</p>
<p>In the beginning of the Japanese rule over Taiwan, the annual output of sugar was only 80,000 to 90,000 catties of raw sugar. In order to achieve the colonial economic exploitation, the Japanese rulers used political power to monopolize the Taiwan sugar industry. The Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Tengshan, and Suzuki financial groups invested in development, inducing farmers to grow sugarcane and improving sugarcane cultivation methods. They also subsidized and protected new sugar factories, which consolidated the foundation of the sugar manufacturing industry. The highest production volume reached 1.46 million metric tons (according to statistics from 1938 to 1939). But what about now? The estimated production for the first half of this year is only 86,000 metric tons, only 1/17 of the previous output.</p>
<p>In 1941, eight sugar companies were merged into four: Taiwan, Nisshin, Meiji, and Ensuiko Sugar Refining Co. Ltd., which had 42 new-style sugar factories. If all of them started operating for 24 hours, they could crush 61,850 metric tons of raw sugarcane. Assuming the average sugar content of sugarcane is 13%, the total sugar production per day would be at least 8,000 metric tons. These four major companies owned 121,858 hectares of sugarcane fields, with a land investment of 118,470,000 Taiwan dollars. They also had 56,210 metric tons of self-operated farms and laid 2,493 kilometers of private railways, with a total investment of 499,833,000 Taiwan dollars.</p>
<p>Of the 42 sugar factories taken over after retrocession, 25 were destroyed by bombing, leaving only 17 in operation. Even those in operation need to be repaired, and whether the destroyed ones can be rebuilt in a short period is a question. The total area planted with sugarcane is 91,425 chia (甲, a unit of area, approx. 2.39 acres). According to the distribution of propagation methods, the newly planted area is 81,690 chia, and the stubble cultivation area is 9,735 chia. There is no way to talk about increasing production.</p>
<p>Difficulties Lie Ahead of Increasing Production</p>
<p>The following issues are crucial to Taiwan sugar's inability to increase production:</p>
<p>A. How to increase production in factories that are already in operation, and how to quickly restore factories that cannot be started?</p>
<p>B. For the 90,000+ chia of sugarcane fields, each chia requires 0.5 tons of ammonium sulfate (chemical fertilizer), totaling 45,000 tons. In the past, all of it was supplied by Japan. Now the Relief Administration has allocated 3,000 tons, which is not even enough for the second crop of rice in the entire province. Only 125 pounds per chia can be distributed to the rice fields around Tainan, and there is even less hope for the sugarcane fields!</p>
<p>C. The Agricultural and Forestry Department recently convened a discussion meeting on sugarcane business, which resolved to increase sugarcane planting, fertilization, and sugar production. At the time, there were major disputes, and it almost became impossible to continue the discussion. As a result, they agreed to change to a sugar-sharing system, with a ratio of 4.8 to 5.2, that is, of the actual sugarcane yield, 52% goes to the factory, and 48% goes to the sugarcane farmers as the sugarcane price! With refined white sugar as the sugar-sharing standard, farmers should get 1/20th of the sugar in kind for their own use, and the remaining sugar is converted into cash. Another council will be formed to determine the price between December and April. This method makes sugarcane farmers hesitate and wait and see, and they will all switch to planting rice and miscellaneous grains. The Japanese used coercive measures and small favors to deal with sugarcane farmers, and this method is not feasible now!</p>
<p>D. Taiwan does not have any refined sugar factories; they are all in Japan. This is one of the main methods used by the Japanese rulers to make Taiwan a complete colony, like manufacturing fertilizers. They take the raw materials or semi-finished products from the colony and make high-quality products for their own enjoyment, leaving only the new-style sugar factories that produce raw sugar (secondary white sugar) in Taiwan. This issue does not seem to have been taken into consideration yet, but it is a difficult one.</p>
<p>Repeating the Italian Story?</p>
<p>The current management agency of Taiwan sugar is Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which is still under preparation. However, it will inherit the takeover after the retrocession and be jointly operated by the Resource Committee and the Provincial Government. It is unlikely that it will be replaced by bureaucratic capital, and it will still only exploit sugarcane farmers. However, people have strong concerns about the Sinicization of various enterprises in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The reporter encountered several sugar industry technicians who either lamented that the company authorities could not reuse the original technicians or said that a group of "literary technicians" had come. They did not treat the work of restoration as work. How can they talk about loyalty and devotion to public service? They frankly said: To measure and estimate the efficiency of the current progress of Taiwan's restoration, talking about increasing production will take at least three to five years. This pessimistic tone reminded the reporter of John Hersey's "A Bell for Adano." He told the story of how the Italian people worked hard to plant and harvest sugarcane, but under fascist rule, the government forced them to buy it. They could not enjoy it and could only manage to buy a little at Christmas every year, which was regarded as a precious luxury. Is Taiwan going to replay the story of Italy? It is not necessary to worry unnecessarily, but it is very likely to continue to rise, rising to the point where even the sugarcane farmers who work hard to plant it will not be able to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Can you be truthful? I firmly believe that the government, experts, and sugarcane farmers will cooperate to overcome this difficulty and save the crisis of the "Sugar Kingdom" because sugar is not only a special product of Taiwan but also China's treasure!</p>

<h3 id="e117">Tragic Roof Collapse at Tianjin's Dongtian Ballroom - "Amazing Program" Turns Into This Scene <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Tianjin Airmail Report, 14th - Special Correspondent Li Shaolin</p>
<p>In the central district of Tianjin City, around 1 PM on the 13th, a tragic building collapse occurred at a dance hall, killing and injuring many people. The incident took place at the Dongtian Dance Restaurant on Changchun Road in the First District. The entire roof of the dance floor collapsed, crushing the Yipinxian and Pei Wenzhai businesses below.</p>
<p>A Thunderous Collapse</p>
<p>Around 1:35 PM, the staff of Yipinxian below the Dongtian Dance Restaurant suddenly heard rustling sounds from the roof and felt the walls trembling. Sensing something was wrong, they rushed out, shouting that the building was about to collapse. Before they could finish speaking, with a thunderous crash, the roof completely collapsed. The cement dance floor crashed through the four floors and fell into Yipinxian. The neighboring Pei Wenzhai was also partially crushed. Immediately, smoke filled the air, and people ran in all directions. Many people escaped from Yipinxian and Pei Wenzhai, covered in mud. Zhu Shaoxiang, an employee of Yipinxian, was unable to escape and was trapped on the second floor. Wang Liansheng, the accountant, was crushed by a large piece of cement on the ground floor. Upon hearing the news, the police station immediately dispatched officers and firefighters to the rescue, and requested assistance from the American military engineering team. Three cranes arrived to assist with the dismantling. Firefighters first rescued Zhu Shaoxiang from the second floor. Wang Liansheng was pulled out from the rubble by the American soldiers. Both were covered in blood, flesh, and mud, and were immediately sent to the Municipal Sixth Hospital for treatment. When the roof collapsed, a rickshaw had just parked in front of Yipinxian. The driver heard the warning and fled, suffering only minor injuries, but the rickshaw was completely smashed. At the same time, another pedestrian, Jiang Baohua, was passing by the scene and was unable to dodge, and was immediately struck down, suffering severe head injuries. He was immediately sent to [omitted], but his life is in great danger.</p>
<p>A Terrible Disaster Caused</p>
<p>The Dongtian Dance Restaurant was originally operating on the third floor of the building. They had arbitrarily opened doors in the main support walls, causing the building to lose its structural integrity. After entering the summer, they converted the ordinary flat roof on the fourth floor into a dance floor. After reorganization, they added a cement dance floor, and just opened for business three days ago. The cause of the disaster was the excessive weight. Furthermore, the area had been flooded in 1939 and suffered a major fire in 1944, so it was already unstable. The manager of Dongtian, Wang Yaozu, fled after the incident. The shareholder, Wu Futing, has been summoned by the police station. In Tianjin this summer, the dance craze has begun, and rooftop garden dance floors are becoming popular. Many operators are profit-driven and their constructions are unreasonable. This disaster may serve as a wake-up call to the operators. It is said that the police station had once ordered the dance hall to close because it lacked an emergency exit. The dance hall then closed its door in the wall and obtained a business license.</p>
<p>Inspection by the Director of the Bureau of Public Works</p>
<p>The Director of the Tianjin Bureau of Public Works, Yan Ziheng, and the Deputy Director, Liang Jinxuan, arrived at the scene to inspect after hearing the news. Director Yan said: When the purpose of a building is changed, it must first be reported to the Bureau of Public Works, and the Bureau of Public Works will send someone to inspect it. After deeming it suitable, a permit will be issued, and then the use can be changed. However, the Dongtian Dance Hall did not report to the Bureau of Public Works when it changed the platform to a dance floor, and it did not report to the Bureau of Public Works when it added the cement dance floor. This makes people wonder if all public places should be inspected before they are reported. At the same time, the issuance of business licenses by the police and social bureaus reflects the lack of communication between the bureaus. Director Yan also said that ordinary buildings have a load-bearing capacity of no more than 40 pounds per square foot, while dance floors need to have a load-bearing capacity of 100 to 120 pounds per square foot. The collapse of the Dongtian Dance Hall was inevitable. If an inspection could have been carried out in advance, this disaster could have been avoided.</p>
<p>Amazing Program Performed</p>
<p>In addition to the people who escaped at the time and were rescued afterward, it has been confirmed that two more people were buried under the rubble: Liu Shude, a colleague of Yipinxian, and Wang Shuxun, who was delivering goods from Liangyou Biscuit Company to Yipinxian. They were found by firefighters late at night.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the incident occurred at 1:30 PM, before the tea dance began. If this disaster had occurred during the tea dance or the evening, when the red-clad men and green-clad women were in full swing, the casualties would have been unimaginable. The reporter observed on the street that the newly painted vermilion door of the Dongtian Dance Restaurant was still intact. Next to the door was a poster that read "Special performance by Hou Baolin and Guo Qiru every night at 10 PM." Who knew that the "amazing program" would be performed in this way!</p>
<h3 id="e118">World Population and Food - Translated by Sibei from "American" Magazine <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Some believe that world order and disorder are directly related to the size of the population. Although the Second World War killed millions, the total population continues to increase. If the current fertility rate is maintained, the population will increase by 200 million in the next ten years. By the end of this century, the world's population will increase by at least 500 million, and if unchecked, it may increase by 1 billion.</p>
<p>However, countries around the world are encouraging childbirth. Britain is questioning mothers with too few children. Mothers who have a second child receive a government bonus. The French government has established a committee to plan for the increase of 1.2 million babies in ten years.</p>
<p>At Russia's current fertility rate, the population could double in forty years. They still use medals and bonuses to encourage prolific mothers, while unmarried men are heavily taxed.</p>
<p>Axis countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan already had overpopulation before World War I. Because of overpopulation, competition for survival became more intense, and people were more likely to submit to the ruling class that could provide them with bread. The ambitious figures of the Axis powers simultaneously encouraged childbirth to create cannon fodder to open up new territories.</p>
<p>The United States only began to feel the pressure of population in this century. In the past, because of ongoing development, land was unlimited, and a large population was not a concern.</p>
<p>Now, in many parts of the world, there is a feeling of overpopulation and insufficient food. Malthus felt the pain of overpopulation a century ago. The turmoil in Asia is also due to this. Africa, South America, and Australia are rapidly depleting their resources, and the increase in population is so rapid that the welfare of the general public is affected.</p>
<p>The United States itself feels slightly overpopulated, but its two dependencies, the Philippines and Puerto Rico, although with high mortality rates, see their populations double every thirty years. The United States must provide relief to avoid famine. We now have a new responsibility to turn Japan into a democratic nation. We sent 75 million Japanese back to their homes. Now, Japan has thirteen times more people per square mile of arable land than the United States, and one million new people are added each year. Simply redistributing the land will not solve the problem.</p>
<p>Scientific methods can increase food supply, but increased food supply may lead to even greater population growth. Therefore, the only way to solve the food shortage is to control childbirth.</p>
<p>Wherever resources and trade are concentrated, the standard of living is bound to be very low. This is because these resources are shared by many people. Moreover, in culturally backward regions, population growth is particularly rapid – such as Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. These areas do not need to increase their fertility rates; as long as they adopt Western medical and sanitary methods to reduce mortality rates and increase the life expectancy of ordinary people, the population surplus will be alarming!</p>
<p>If India reduces its mortality rate to the same level as the United States, while maintaining its current fertility rate, it would need five Earths to support it in a hundred years.</p>
<p>Many people still firmly believe that there is a direct relationship between numbers and strength. More people mean victory. If the security of the United States depended on population size, it would have been defeated at the beginning of the war. Both World Wars were won by the United States turning defeat into victory. It is clear that in modern warfare, manpower is not very important. In future atomic warfare, manpower will be even less important. Human intelligence and wisdom are the most effective forces for competing for survival and achieving world peace.</p>
<p>A country must have a surplus of goods beyond daily life to win today. The reason why the United States was able to defeat the Axis powers was due to its staggering amount of material resources. Stalin said at the Tehran Conference, "There would be no victory without American supplies."</p>
<p>I once said that the United States also feels slightly overpopulated. Professor Whelpton said: "From the perspective of the economic welfare received by each individual, the population of the United States is excessive, but its degree of excess is not as serious as that of most countries."</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, the United States would be better off with only 100 million people than with the current 140 million, but the US government estimates that our population will increase by as many as 40 million people. Therefore, in the next fifty years, our fertility rate should decrease by one-third.</p>
<p>After considering the depletion of American resources (the former Secretary of the Interior has published in American magazines) and the depletion of land due to careless farming methods, one can feel the horror of population growth.</p>
<p>The thin topsoil of farmland, usually less than a foot thick, is the key to our survival. If one inch is removed, it will take at least three hundred years to recover, but some farmland will lose an inch after a single heavy rain. The chairman of the American Soil Conservation Committee once announced: "We lose land equivalent to two hundred forty-acre farms every day due to wind and rain… In fact, the United States no longer has good farmland."</p>
<p>Even more serious than the erosion of farmland is the erosion of the people. Our population increase is entirely due to the higher fertility rate of those with the lowest education, the least success, and the lowest intelligence.</p>
<p>Many studies illustrate this frightening phenomenon. According to statistics from the Census Bureau, mothers in the United States who have received seven years or less of education have an average of 3 and 2/3 children, but mothers of the same age who have a secondary school or college education have an average of 1 and 2/3 children.</p>
<p>Another survey of school children in four American cities showed that the children with the lowest intelligence came from families with an average of six children, while the children with the highest intelligence came from families with an average of two and a half children.</p>
<p>If this situation continues for seventy years, the descendants of our least intelligent and least successful families will outnumber the descendants of our most intelligent and most successful families by sixteen times. (Abridged from "American" magazine)</p>

<h3 id="e119">Hunan Province Strengthens Highway Network <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli, Changsha Air Dispatch, 10th</p>
<p>Social security and smooth transportation can promote reconstruction. Although Hunan's social order has experienced several small disturbances in Changsha, it is generally stable. In terms of transportation, the full operation of the Yuehan Railway has given people a great sense of excitement.</p>
<p>Yuehan Railway Revenue Insufficient to Cover Expenses</p>
<p>The Yuehan Railway is 1,500 kilometers long, connecting north and south and running through three provinces. The entire line was occupied in the 33rd year [of the Republic, 1944], and after the recovery, active construction and repair were carried out. According to the report of Director Du Tieyuan of the Railway Bureau: the damage to the line was the worst of all railways in the country. Of the 119 major bridges, 102 were damaged; of the 600 small bridges, 160 were damaged; 5 tunnels were completely destroyed; all steel beams were destroyed and removed; and important subgrade earthwork was completely excavated. The repair budget was initially set at 37 billion at the beginning of this year, but due to rising prices, all equipment had to be simplified, with the primary goal of opening the line. Therefore, the current so-called opening is still only considered a preliminary opening, and the standard for formal opening is still very far away. For example, the bridge piers are all temporary wooden bridges, and the station granaries, platforms, and coal and water equipment are all temporary in nature. Tunnels that could not be completed were bypassed with temporary bridges, and these wooden temporary bridges are at risk of being washed away by floods. Currently, two special express trains run in each direction per week, and one freight train runs daily. Based on the length of the line and the expected volume of transportation, it is estimated that 376 locomotives, 390 passenger cars, and 3,543 freight cars are needed. However, only 80 locomotives of all sizes have been repaired from the remaining ones (short 296), 1,411 freight cars (short 2,131), and 84 passenger cars (short 342). Distributing these vehicles across the entire 1,000-kilometer line makes it difficult to expect sufficient train services. The current monthly revenue for the entire line is about 1 billion or more, but expenses require 4 billion yuan, and it still relies on government subsidies. This shows one aspect of the railway's difficult situation.</p>
<p>Yijiawan Train Accident - Station Vandalized</p>
<p>The engineering aspects are all temporary in nature. Since the opening of the line, several accidents have occurred. The most serious was the train overturning at Yijiawan. On the 7th, a Wuhan-Changsha freight train was traveling from Changsha to Yijiawan Station. As it entered the second track, due to rain, the subgrade soil became loose, the sleepers sank, and the rails could not support the weight, causing the locomotive to derail and two carriages to overturn. The train did not have passenger tickets, but many people crowded onto the locomotive. After the locomotive derailed, it crashed directly into the subgrade, killing seven passengers immediately and seriously injuring eleven. One of the injured died after being transported back to Changsha. A few soldiers on the train, not knowing the truth, questioned the stationmaster and vandalized the Yijiawan Station, causing considerable damage. According to sources within the Railway Bureau: the bureau is limited by materials and funding, so the project cannot proceed according to the planned schedule, and the safety of train operation is a major concern. The line is open, but the inability to immediately strengthen the equipment is regrettable.</p>
<p>Work-Relief Road Construction Plan - Implemented Step by Step</p>
<p>After social stability, transportation recovery, and disaster relief improvement, the government has shifted its focus to construction projects. The provincial government has formulated a work-relief road construction plan to strengthen the province's highway network, planning to repair 913 kilometers of highways damaged during the war and build 3,060 kilometers of new highways, requiring a total of 72.1 billion yuan in construction funds, which can accommodate 721,500 disaster victims. This plan is being implemented step by step. When the plan is completed, cars will be able to reach all counties in Hunan Province. This is part of Chairman Wang's large-scale work-relief plan.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to study the constitution, realize constitutional government, and promote cultural and economic development, the provincial government has established three committees: Constitutional Research, Cultural Development, and Economic Development. They have been approved by the provincial government meeting and will soon be established. The reconstruction of southern Hunan may be achieved through concrete plans developed by these three committees.</p>

<p>(1) Deep Lymph Node Shadows</p>
<p>Wu Renhou asks: I had an X-ray examination the other day, which revealed deep shadows in the lymph nodes of my lungs. Please tell me: (1) What is the cause of the deep shadows in the lymph nodes? (2) How to treat them? (3) Can taking more cod liver oil cure it?</p>
<p>[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi] (1) Deep lymph node shadows are related to weak lungs; (2) You can take various vitamin pills and blood-tonifying tonics, or you can also inject glucose calcium and vitamin C; (3) Eating more cod liver oil capsules in winter is also good.</p>
<p>(2) Asthma and Palpitations</p>
<p>Yan Xiufang asks: I am 22 years old, female. I suffered from asthma last winter and recovered after treatment, but now it has recurred with palpitations, lower back pain, asthma, and weakness, but my appetite has not decreased. Please tell me (1) Is it bronchitis? (2) What are the methods of treatment?</p>
<p>[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi] Based on the various conditions described in the letter, I am afraid it is asthma caused by heart disease. You need to have your heart examined and diagnosed with X-rays. If it is asthma caused by heart disease, you need to use cardiotonics, diuretics, and large doses of vitamin B.</p>
<p>(3) Leg and Knee Pain</p>
<p>Chen Yucheng asks: In the 29th year of the Republic [1940], I suffered from typhoid fever and developed white spots on my body. The doctor mistakenly thought they were sores and ordered me to apply ointment after bathing, so the toxins were not completely cleared. My legs and knees are slightly weak, and the inner side of my tibia, five or six inches from the knee, is slightly hot, numb, and painful to the touch. The pain is particularly severe in rainy weather and after eating spicy foods. I don't know what kind of disease it is. There is suspicion of syphilis. Please advise on treatment methods.</p>
<p>[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi] It is best to have a detailed blood test and examination first. You can go to the free department of the municipal hospital for a consultation. If it is related to syphilis, you need to use anti-syphilitic agents. If it is rheumatic arthritis, you need to use ibuprofen.</p>
<p>(4) Excessive Sweating of Hands and Feet</p>
<p>Shen Qingsheng asks: In the summer, I sweat excessively from my hands and feet. It is very inconvenient when I am working at my desk or interacting with people. My feet are dirty and unbearable due to excessive sweating, and they have a strange odor, which is a hindrance to hygiene. Is there any way to prevent this? Please answer in the newspaper.</p>
<p>[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi] Excessive sweating of the hands and feet is due to excessive neurotic secretion. Take nerve-tonifying and blood-tonifying tonics, and wash your hands and feet more often. You can wipe them with diluted liquor.</p>

<h3 id="e124">The Eyes of the Northeast - Inside Story of Xiaofengman Power Station - Jilin Air Dispatch, 15th <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>When the national army was stationed in Jilin, what the 40 million people of the Northeast were most concerned about was not the safety of Jilin City, but the safety of the "Xiaofengman Power Station." "Xiaofengman" is more than forty miles southwest of Jilin, in the Western Mountains. It cuts off the Songhua River and builds a dam to create an artificial waterfall for power generation. The length and weight of its dam are not only the first in the Far East, but also rank among the top in the world. The power generation capacity is second only to the United States and the Soviet Union and ranks third in the world. If it is damaged, the major cities of the Northeast will be plunged into darkness. The impact on public security, industry, and life is imaginable.</p>
<p>The east bank of the Songhua River is the factory area of the power station, and the west bank is the management area and residential area. Surrounded by mountains and the river flowing horizontally, the scenery is exceptionally beautiful. The east and west banks are connected by a steel bridge, which has now been destroyed.</p>
<p>From one or two miles away from "Xiaofengman," you can hear the rumbling sound. You can see ten artificial waterfalls cascading down the dam. The water depth on the dam is as deep as 40 meters, while the water depth below the dam is only one zhang (about 3.3 meters). The water waves above and below are very calm, but after passing through the dam holes, they pour down like thousands of horses galloping, with fierce water勢 and splashing water flowers, which is extremely spectacular.</p>
<p>The dam is a gravity dam with a volume of 2 million cubic meters. The total length of the dam is 1200 meters, divided into 6000 sections from the left bank to the right bank. Each section is 18 cubic meters wide and 90 meters high. The total amount of concrete is 1,920,000 cubic meters. The reservoir area is 550 square kilometers, 170 kilometers long, and the storage capacity is 11 billion cubic meters. Construction started in the 27th year of the Republic of China [1938] and started generating electricity on February 26th of the 33rd year [1944], mobilizing 20,000 people to work day and night. The original budget was 150 million yuan in puppet currency, but the final cost reached 250 million yuan. The power station can supply power to Changchun, Harbin, Fushun, and Jilin. The Songchang power transmission line to Changchun is 113 kilometers long. The Songbin line to Harbin is 265 kilometers long. The line to Fushun is 360 kilometers long. The former two lines are 154 JK, and the latter is 220 KU·22. The high voltage of the power transmission line is not only the first in China, but also rare in East Asia. In the past, the power generation was 190,000 kilowatts. If thermal power generation is used, 4,500 tons of coal are needed per day.</p>
<p>On August 20th of last year, the Soviet army had 20-30 paratroopers land at "Xiaofengman". Infantry also arrived in four or five days. On September 20th, they began to dismantle the machinery. There were 2,000 Soviet troops and 2,000 Japanese prisoners of war dismantling day and night. The dismantling personnel left on November 3rd. The total amount of dismantling included two completed units made in Switzerland, two units 50% completed made in Germany, and two units 20% completed made in Germany. Three KU transformers made in Japan, three 154 KU OCB made in Japan (Hitachi!), two 22DKU made in Japan (Hitachi!), five 138U units, dismantled switchboards, two cranes for civil engineering, one train of oil, and countless other spare parts. "Xiaofengman" plays a decisive role in power generation and has many main functions. For example, in terms of transportation, the water above the dam is 40 meters deep, allowing warships of 45,000 tons to pass. In terms of transporting wood, wood from "Dafengman" upstream can be transported here by the river, and then loaded onto trains and transported to various places. In addition, it regulates water conservancy and facilitates fishery. At present, it only generates electricity, and other functions have not yet been fully utilized.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Seven Ways to Handle Strikes <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Eric Johnston, Translated by Bao Huamao</p>
<p>The author is the former president of the American Chamber of Commerce. He has accumulated four years of experience in consulting with labor and management during wartime. In conclusion, he states that for the sake of industrial peace in the United States, new laws are needed. Labor disputes in our country are also inevitable, so this is translated as a reference.</p>
<p>All of America fears more strikes. We have far too many strikes. The material losses are enormous and shocking. Even worse, people harbor malice and suspicion. The country needs industrial harmony more than anything else.</p>
<p>To want permanent industrial peace is simply wishful thinking, because the relationship between labor and management is a human relationship, and human relationships are often fraught with friction and contention.</p>
<p>We do not want to extinguish all strikes, as only totalitarian countries would do so. However, democratic countries also hope that labor and management will improve their skills and systems and get along together.</p>
<p>All industrial wars will lead to the need for labor laws. People often shout loudly, "Pass laws!" This is so easy and convenient to shout. We say that this law allows labor and management to go their own way, but too much compulsion is also not good. We cannot legislate "Human Nature." That is an ironclad fact.</p>
<p>Industrial peace cannot be achieved by legislation alone, but some legislation is necessary. I advocate that legislation should establish fair rules, and those who violate these rules should be punished. We need these rules to protect labor and also to protect capital.</p>
<p>Let me state my position. The right to strike is a fundamental right of Americans. This must always be so, but the strikes and the reasons for strikes can be reduced.</p>
<p>Many people think that a strike is just a strike. In fact, strikes can be divided into seven categories. Let us describe them separately and discuss how to deal with them.</p>
<p>(1) Organizational Strikes: This is when a union strike picket forces other workers to join the union and forces the factory owner to sign a contract with the union.</p>
<p>This kind of strike is not worth protecting. It deprives workers of the right to choose whether or not to join the union. This is a reactionary strike. The Wagner Act provides an election mechanism for workers to vote on whether they want to join the union. The ballot box—America's sacred tradition—replaces the strike picket line.</p>
<p>Solution: The Wagner Act can be amended. Irresponsible unions should be punished. The law is eleven years old. Based on past experience, we can know its advantages and disadvantages. Amend it to suit the current situation.</p>
<p>(2) Jurisdictional Strikes. This is a strike caused by disputes between unions over which union the members belong to.</p>
<p>Solution: Workers should organize a committee on union jurisdiction issues to arbitrate the matter. When the committee cannot decide, the government should intervene. The Central Labor Bureau should be authorized to allow workers to decide which union they are subject to. The government should strengthen the Central Labor Bureau to punish violating unions and their leaders.</p>
<p>(3) Sympathy Strikes: Workers here strike out of sympathy for workers on strike elsewhere. The jargon of sympathy strikes is absurd. This is not only an unreasonable strike, but it is also not even worthy of sympathy.</p>
<p>Solution: This type of strike should not be protected by law. For the benefit of the workers themselves, workers should abolish this type of strike. Workers do not need to strike out of "sympathy" for workers elsewhere.</p>
<p>(4) Political Strikes: A strike caused by workers opposing a certain government policy. In fact, workers can use petitions, meetings, and public opinion methods to achieve political demands, just like citizens. They should not use economic weapons for political demands. Solution: The solution is the same as for (3). This type of strike should not be protected by law.</p>
<p>(5) Public Utility Strikes: This type of strike directly affects the public interest. Public utilities, whether publicly or privately owned, should be accountable to the government. Even their interest rates, profits, and types of services should be subject to government approval.</p>
<p>Solution: Legislation should establish an arbitration mechanism to handle this type of dispute. The Railway Arbitration Act can be used as a blueprint.</p>
<p>(6) Language Interpretation Strikes: This is a strike caused by misunderstandings in the translation of the language in the contract or by different interpretations of a certain word or term in the contract by foremen and workers.</p>
<p>Solution: Labor and management should agree to first stop the labor unrest, and then arbitrate the interpretation of the contract. It is best to have competent, knowledgeable, and permanent arbitrators responsible for handling this, and their salaries should be provided by labor and management.</p>
<p>(7) Contract Strikes: This is a strike due to workers' demands for improved wages, working hours, and factory equipment. This is easy to understand and the most difficult to resolve. Most strikes fall into this category. Recent strikes in the automotive, steel, coal, and electrical industries also fall into this category.</p>
<p>Solution: Before the strike, keep them negotiating. Keep this bargaining going until both parties sign a contract. That means negotiating while the workers continue working.</p>
<p>To complete this kind of negotiation, other unions should organize an industrial mediation jury, with representatives from labor and management participating, followed by government mediation.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, strikers are required to notify the government of mediation seven days in advance, stating the reasons for the intended strike in the notification. Violators of this provision are subject to a fine. Of course, the original intention is to hope that labor and management will reach an agreement before the strike. This system has achieved great success and is worthy of American learning.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Production Construction and Promoting National Goods <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— By He Ren</p>
<p>After victory, the cry for production construction has spread throughout the country, which is indeed a very good phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, in my humble opinion, production construction is certainly important, but promoting national goods so that people generally have a "love for national goods" mentality should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Because we know that production construction is indeed an important prerequisite for building a new China, but on the one hand, while chanting production construction and engaging in production construction, on the other hand, a large amount of foreign goods continues to flow in, and the people welcome foreign goods and despise domestic products, then, will not production construction be futile? Therefore, production construction and promoting national goods must go hand in hand, and must be closely linked. The production sector actively engages in production construction, and social groups and educational institutions engage in the promotion of national goods. We must cultivate a general mentality of "taking pride in using national goods," and then production construction can achieve its goals and be successful.</p>
<p>At present, foreign goods in general are already being imported in a steady stream. We are absolutely not resisting foreign goods, but we are in extreme need of promoting national goods. We hope that the Ministry of Education, starting from the next semester, will print course materials on loving national goods into primary and secondary school textbooks. School teachers should lead by example and use national goods. Parents in general should also encourage their children to love and use national goods. The leaders of government agencies and social groups should also include the purchase of national goods in their service performance evaluations. If the whole country can unanimously and actively promote national goods, the future of the production sector will be bright, and the goals of construction will be achieved step by step.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, the movement to promote national goods had considerable achievements. However, after eight years of trampling by the enemy and puppets, domestic materials were scarce, and the people's lives were in misery every day. Once victory came and maritime transport was smooth, they could not help but be overjoyed at the sight of novel foreign goods and rushed to buy them, which of course cannot be harshly criticized. However, we must look to the future and observe from the perspective of the entire national economy. Promoting national goods is currently a matter of urgency. Because only by promoting national goods can we preserve the weak Chinese national industry; and only by promoting national goods can we prevent the work of production construction from being disconnected midway, or even collapsing midway!</p>
<h3 id="e127">Introduction to Business Management <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— By Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>C. Manufacturing Speed</p>
<p>The time spent in the manufacturing process is well worth considering. If it takes a little longer for each movement, then the time spent in a month or a year adds up considerably. This does not mean that speed is the only goal, and everything can be made crudely. In fact, the goal is to produce perfect products in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>To know how much time it takes to make a product, the best way is to conduct experiments. Experiments should be conducted in the early stages of the start of a manufacturing plant. There are several ways to determine the standard for manufacturing speed:</p>
<p>A. At the beginning of the work, record a time, let the work proceed, and when it is completed, record another time, and you can know the time required to manufacture a product.</p>
<p>B. Many products require several steps to be combined to make a product. If it takes a total of three days from start to finish, then at the end of the three days, you can check the number of products made, and you can know how many can be produced per day. If you work eight hours a day, you can also know how many can be produced per hour on average.</p>
<p>With this standard, there are the following three uses:</p>
<p>A. A standard can be set for how many products can be produced per day. If production decreases on a certain day, the cause can be immediately investigated and corrected.</p>
<p>B. It can make it easy to implement production plans. For example, if you plan to produce products worth so many tens of thousands of dollars, you can calculate how many units there are in total and how many days it will take. Sometimes when a batch of orders comes from the outside, you can also calculate how many days it will take to deliver the goods.</p>
<p>C. Costs can be calculated. After the time required for production, costs can be calculated.</p>
<p>A manufacturing plant engaged in production must never be casual and without standards, so the manufacturing speed must be studied.</p>
<p>Female Workers and Child Labor</p>
<p>In many factories, in addition to male workers, there are many female workers and child workers. The reasons for employing female workers and child workers are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>A. There are no male workers equal to the need: If a factory cannot completely use male workers, then female workers are used instead.</p>
<p>B. Female workers' wages are lower: Female workers' wages are often lower than male workers' wages, because female workers often do not need to bear the cost of family expenses. Male workers often have the burden of family expenses. As for child labor, the price is even lower than that of female workers. In some places, child workers can do the job, so employing child workers can reduce manufacturing costs a little.</p>
<p>C. Female workers are more obedient: Compared to male workers, female workers are relatively more obedient.</p>
<p>However, this cannot be the biggest reason for employing female workers, but it is only one of the advantages of female workers.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Fang Jikan Over the Past Twenty Years <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>My friend Fang Jikan, whose given name is Yan, and another name is Yu Zhuan, is from Yongjia. He is proficient in epigraphy and calligraphy and excels at seal carving. He came to Shanghai in the spring of the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926). Wu Changshuo, Zeng Nongran, Chu Tihang, and other elders praised him and asked him to carve seals, noting that every character was historically grounded. He studied with Zhao Shuru. Shuru once said: "The only one who can discuss seal carving with me is Jikan." Jikan once carved a jade seal for his teacher. Once, they went to the Xiling Seal Society. Gao Yehou, Ding Fuzhi, Wang Fuchang, and other elders were present. Fuzhi took out Shuru's jade seal and showed it to Fuchang, jokingly saying: "I obtained this seal and named Shuru because of it." Fuchang stroked and examined it, thinking that only the hand of a Han person could achieve this. Fuzhi replied: "There is a Han person sitting here now." Only then did he know that it was made by Jikan, and he sighed in amazement. The whole room roared with laughter. He served as the director of the printing department of the Xiling Seal Society. Later, he served as a professor at the Shanghai Art College and the Xinhua Art College for four or five years. Many of his students became famous. Jing Yiyuan of Shangyu introduced him as a close friend, and they lived together in the Han Zhi You She, discussing literature and painting every day. The Shanghai Court knew that he was skilled in calligraphy and proficient in appraisal, and hired him as an appraiser. Fearing that the appraisal would be inappropriate and cause trouble, he firmly declined. In the winter of the twenty-third year (1934), he went to the capital, and Yiyuan invited him to live with him. Jikan was hospitable and generous, pawning his clothes for wine without the slightest hesitation. Yiyuan knew that he was poor and once gave him gold. Jikan said: "Yiyuan is honest, this is clean money, and it can be accepted." Famous officials and dignitaries of the time considered it an honor to have one of his seals, and his name was very famous. In the autumn of the following year, he traveled with Yiyuan to the scenic spots of Mount Hua and Mount Wutai. On the way back to D梁, he searched for ancient relics. In the spring of the twenty-fifth year (1936), he went to Beiping and stayed at Dafeng Hall, discussing seal carving and calligraphy with Daqian every day. All the seals used by Daqian were made by him. At that time, famous figures in the former capital, such as Chen Sanyuan and Chuan Yuanshu, were friends with him and gave him poems. The Ministry of Education held the Second National Art Exhibition in Nanjing and hired him as a member of the review committee. After coming south, he had the opportunity to work with Fang Junbi, Xie Zhiliu, and others in Yandang, staying for a short time. Later, at the invitation of Ma Shuping, he took a position in the Palace Museum, editing and researching the famous works of past masters. At that time, Chairman Lin of the National Government also knew of his abilities and planned to hire him as a secretary. Daqian jokingly called him Fang Waiting Edict. However, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred the day after Jikan arrived at the museum, and he was trapped for several months before he could escape and return home, closing his door and not going out. After that, the chaos of the bandits deepened, and the puppet government was established, and he was once invited to preside over the seal bureau. Jikan said: "The head can be cut off, but the matter cannot be done," and burned his books. Wang Jisi wrote about it, which appeared in the Zhejiang Daily. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, Yongjia was bombed three times and fell three times. Jikan took care of the old and young and wandered around, experiencing hardship. His mother was sick and in danger, and he personally served her medicine, washing her and taking care of her for six days and nights without taking off his clothes, and the disease was cured because of it. When the bandits arrived, he moved elsewhere. Li Yifei of Ruian lived in his house, and he was finally able to settle down a little. When the bandits were in Yongjia, they asked him to carve seals, but he did not get them and hated him; and the local bullies also added insults from time to time. At that time, Jikan's suffering was truly unspeakable. However, he never carved a seal for the enemy and puppets, and people admired him even more for it. After the victory of the national celebration of the surrender of the bandits, Jikan made a seal and wrote a poem to commemorate it: "The flags of all nations are spread in the blue sky, and today I am happy to see the nine states united. From now on, there will be no more swords and halberds in the world, and I will also sing aloud and strike the soil, old man." Jikan initially learned from Rangzhi; then he followed the Qin and Han dynasties. He once copied ancient seals, obtaining tens of thousands of characters, called Er Yin Wen Zong, but it was not published due to the chaos. Changshi Liangchang Youqian once edited it with him; later, due to some things, it did not work out. Shuru saw that his editing was meticulous and profound, and helped him with his manuscript, making it a great success. Yun Guyu Yin Hui is also written by him. Jikan does not need to think when carving a seal, and he can make it immediately without violating the ancient system. The seal is based on Da Li; the calligraphy is based on Shi Chen. At first, he was famous for his paintings of antiques; recently, he has written landscapes and pine, plum, chrysanthemum, and rock, which are also ancient and full of strange energy. Scholars who are engaged in seal carving and study fine characters all respect Jikan; scholars who are good at calligraphy and painting and study seals all ask Jikan for help. People all love and pity him; and Jikan is happy and tireless, and the more he struggles, the more he is encouraged. Since he came to Shanghai from last autumn, he has carved no less than a thousand seals. One day, he passed by my Wangping Building, and a guest greeted him and said: "This gentleman is full of epigraphic aura, is he not Fang Guangsheng?" How can it be accidental that people know that he is Mr. Fang at a glance?</p>
<h3 id="e130">A Corner of the Cemetery <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Ying</p>
<p>The sky is blue almost to transparency, and a few scattered white clouds are moving slowly, gathering and dispersing like light smoke, and misty like a thin fog. The pale round moon lies alone at one end, pouring its cold light softly onto the earth.</p>
<p>The wilderness spreads out in all directions, but is cut off by a dark mountain range. The desolate grass sways with the wind, then raises its head, always doing that monotonous action. The mountain trees are as dark as ink, and sway their fat bodies rustling.</p>
<p>The distant villages are all asleep, and the time has come for the corner of the cemetery in this wilderness to wake up.</p>
<p>In fact, to say that this is a cemetery is just a mound of earth here and a mound of earth there; this is the collection by kind-hearted people in the village of corpses that are lying scattered and uncared for.</p>
<p>Old Man Wen, who was sleeping in the southeast corner, first turned over and sat up, rubbing his sleepy eyes. He looked around.</p>
<p>"Children, the moon has risen to the top of our heads, it's time to get up!" This is a weak voice, but it is loud enough to resound through the silent night.</p>
<p>There was a commotion, and Wang Youxin, Liu Fuzi, Zhou Da Niang and Chen Laoda all sat up, leaving only Dong Er and a girl with braids still sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>Chen Laoda leaned lazily against the earth mound, muttering to himself: "Um, get up, get up... Isn't getting up the same as sleeping? Still no news at all."</p>
<p>Everyone sat there blankly, their eyes looking forward without a target. All that could be heard was an occasional sigh or two.</p>
<p>Old Man Wen lit his early morning pipe and said, "It's been a full six months since Dong Er came and told us that we had won the victory. We wake up and go to sleep like this every day, getting farther and farther away from the world." He took a deep puff of smoke and exhaled a cloud of white mist, "If we could have some news to know that everyone at home is safe and sound, and that everyone has eaten white rice, then that would be reassuring!"</p>
<p>These words raised all of Chen Laoda's worries; "In peaceful years, it should be time to transplant rice seedlings, who knows what kind of unlucky days we are living now!"</p>
<p>Zhou Da Niang could not help but wipe the corners of her eyes with her clothes.</p>
<p>Wang Youxin jumped up: "That's not how it is, Chen Laoda! Our squad leader used to tell us that it's nothing for a real man to suffer a little. Everyone is fighting for the War of Resistance. The suffering is not for nothing, you see, we have won now, and our China has also come to the day to turn over and stand up!"</p>
<p>The sermon-like firm tone made everyone silent.</p>
<p>Two old ducks could not find their way home, and flew around in the air, flapping their wings. They squawked a few times and then flew past.</p>
<p>Liu Fuzi hummed his song that he never left his mouth: "My home is on the Songhua River in Northeast China, where there are mountains and plains of soybeans and sorghum..."</p>
<p>Chen Laoda got annoyed: "Are you going to finish or not? Always this unlucky song! Who doesn't know that your home is on the Songhua River? Who doesn't have a home? Over the years, some have died. Some have escaped, and a good family has been torn apart. Old Man Wen, why did you starve to death on the side of the road? Zhou Da Niang, why were you driven out of your hometown? Liu Fuzi, Wang Youxin, you also talk about why you were forced onto the battlefield..."</p>
<p>Wang Youxin didn't like to hear this: "Okay! Why mention the past? Have you heard, now the War of Resistance has been won, the Japanese devils have rolled away, and our parents and the people no longer have to eat sorghum leaves, and no longer have to be slaves. There are good days ahead! The suffering was not for nothing, do you understand?"</p>
<p>"I'm really afraid of suffering," Old Man Wen said slowly. "May the good days come soon!"</p>
<p>"Of course they will come! They will definitely come!" Wang Youxin was always faithful to his beliefs, patted his chest and assured everyone.</p>
<p>The moonlight was even more uniform, and all that could be heard was the rustling of the dark shadows of the trees on the mountain. Dong Er slept soundly, the girl was mumbling in her mouth, only "Mommy, Mommy" could be heard. Still not awake.</p>
<p>Liu Fuzi looked around, and suddenly found a new partner sleeping not far from his left hand. Everyone was surprised and delighted, and shook him awake! "Hey, friend, what news is there outside, how did you get here?"</p>
<p>The new partner sat up with a grunt: "How did I come? The stray bullet sent me here!"</p>
<p>Liu Fuzi spat at him: "Stop talking nonsense, the devils have long gone, who invited you to eat stray bullets?"</p>
<p>The newcomer also felt strange, why the sound of artillery fire was so noisy, but he could not hear anything here. So he described in detail to everyone what he knew.</p>
<p>The wind was a little cool, and the moon did not know where it had gone. The clouds were really unpredictable, dark and heavy as if they were about to fall to the ground. Everything in the wilderness was holding its breath and listening attentively to the narrative that was sometimes sad and sometimes resentful. When the provoked emotions burned to a height, they only seemed numb. The red light of Old Man Wen's dry pipe flashed, reflecting the expressions of those nearby who were frowning.</p>
<p>The speaker ended his report with the words "People's lives are worthless these days, and the people are doomed to be unlucky"! No one dared to believe his words, but no one dared not to believe his words. Used to being played with by fate, no one could place their trust in their own wishes anymore.</p>
<p>Chen Laoda said: "When will the day of standing up come?"</p>
<p>Liu Fuzi was full of grievances: "What exactly are we suffering for?"</p>
<p>Zhou Da Niang kept wiping the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>Old Man Wen shook his head and sighed: "God really has no eyes!"</p>
<p>In Youxin buried his head in his hands, his faith was shattered, and everything seemed empty</p>
<p>Pain engulfed every heart.</p>
<p>Gradually, the cemetery went to sleep again, but nightmares relentlessly haunted even the dead.</p>
<p>The earth was whispering, conveying news to each other, the surface was still so peaceful and comfortable.</p>

<p>— Jiang Xingyu</p>
<p>In the late autumn of 1944, I moved from South Hot Springs to North Hot Springs. Autumn is the prelude to the fog season, and the entire red basin is immersed in a milky, hazy atmosphere. The small boats from Beibei to the hot springs are densely packed on the Jialing River like a swarm of ants. Our boat raised its small white sail, letting the moist autumn wind blow it, slowly ascending along the soft sandy shore. The undulating peaks welcomed me with lush greenery, and the river reflecting the undulating peaks was a bright, radiant blue, so blue that I felt its loveliness deep within my heart. The boat entered D渡口, and the low sky suddenly seemed much higher. The first thing that attracted my gaze was the glazed tile ridges of the Hot Springs Temple, and the tall red walls with gnarled ancient cypresses formed a classic landscape painting.</p>
<p>I needed to quietly recuperate in this quiet mountain country for some time. I settled down in a villa on the mountainside. The house was surrounded by sparse bamboo fences. Although the wisteria flowers had already withered, the withered vines still tightly embraced the fence. Occasionally, two or three sparrows exchanged short conversations on the eaves, which only served to accentuate the lonely atmosphere.</p>
<p>Looking out from the window, there was a desolate bamboo forest, rarely trodden by people throughout the year, appearing desolate and gloomy. The ground was covered with a thin layer of moss, allowing newts and beetles to stroll comfortably. When they stepped on a corner of fallen leaves, a slight rustling sound would be emitted. At the end of the bamboo forest lay an abandoned highway, now only walked by people going to the market, only by village children herding cattle and sheep. Further away were the endless rolling hills of tea brown, stretching into the distance.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the fence gate, there was a flat dam with tender grass, which I later often used for playing badminton or as a sunbathing area.</p>
<p>Life was leisurely. Every morning when I took a walk nearby, I would occasionally pick some bouquets of flowers and put them in a vase, nurturing them with water. All morning, I would lie on a deck chair. The light in the house was relatively dim, so the deck chair was placed on the veranda. To make my body comfortable, I often wore pajamas. When the fog was too heavy or the wind picked up, I was afraid of catching a cold, so I preferred to cover myself with a towel blanket. Beside the deck chair was a small table for tea cups and books. Among the books, Omar Khayyam's "Rubaiyat" was indispensable, although I had already read it so many times that I could recite it. My love for Longjing tea and "Rubaiyat" almost bordered on a mental disorder.</p>
<p>Lying down and looking up at the sky gave me the feeling of being at sea. Wasn't that gray sky just like the waters of the English Channel, shrouded in white mist all year round?</p>
<p>On rainy days, the newspaper deliverer and the postman didn't come up the mountain. It seemed as if I was completely isolated from the world. Only the gurgling eavesdrops played a monotonous harp, like a singer with no audience. It was not uncommon for it to rain for one or two weeks in a row. I still hadn't finished the calligraphy book that the Chinese Calligraphy Research Association had asked me to write. I planned to use the rainy days to read the rubbings I had collected since entering Sichuan. The melancholy mood of the "Orchid Pavilion Preface" prevented me from finding peace, so I could only stand up and smoke a pipe or two, vainly trying to dilute the infected melancholy with the smoke rings.</p>
<p>I had long forgotten the habit of using a clock, and I was too lazy to turn the calendar on my desk. It was covered in dust, covered by the remains of bottled flowers. The seasons were still changing silently. It wasn't until I walked through the valley one time and saw a few small wintersweet flowers blooming that I realized it was already the end of the year.</p>
<p>The North Hot Springs Park in winter was not noisy. One or two withered lotus leaves floated in the Lotus Pond, gently trembling with the cold shimmering water. Now, those tourists from the city had long returned to the city. Even the craftsmen who repaired the flowers were resting at home. Only I, carrying a wisteria cane, walked alone on this stone-paved road in the whistling mountain wind at the end of the year.</p>
<p>My cane had long become part of my body. In these rugged mountains, I couldn't leave it for a minute. I didn't enjoy taking a mountain sedan chair. I didn't want those porters who were thinner and more haggard than me to carry me up a steep slope. Their heavy panting and pained expressions magically made me feel unspeakably heartbroken.</p>
<p>Midway between the Hot Springs Temple and the Jinyun Temple, a small lake was surrounded by mountains. I made my first pilgrimage there on a slightly snowy morning. The still lake water was so deep green, and the tall cedar trees on the lake shore were so white and clean. A row of blue railings lined the long dike, as if the other side of the long dike was the heaven we sought. Light snow still fell, as if afraid of being noticed, while the bell of the Zongjue Temple fell sparsely with the snowflakes. In this unity, my humble life was inspired, and my ignorant soul was enlightened. I wished to transform into every drop of lake water, I wished to transform into every branch and leaf of the cedar trees, I wished to spend my future years in the sound of bells.</p>
<p>During the long winter nights, the stove fire was my closest friend. The glow of the stove fire painted a layer of crimson on my face, which had too many wrinkles from wind and frost. The crackling of a lump of coal, the shooting of a spark, was a noteworthy event of the entire winter night. I never failed to appreciate the warmth of the stove fire. I would sit by the stove until every lump of coal had been completely burned and turned into dead ashes that had exhausted their heat, and only then would I reluctantly go to sleep.</p>
<p>Covered with a thick quilt, I often had dreams, which was a hardship I couldn't escape. Whether the dream was joyful or sorrowful, I couldn't avoid the feeling of emptiness when I woke up. Those natural objects and images quickly disappeared, leaving only an endless darkness, and shadows that were faintly visible in the darkness. Dreams are empty and impossible to grasp. The life of a person is nothing more than a long dream! Nothing more than a series of trivial dreams!</p>
<p>Spring lingered in the mountains, and I was already familiar with every path and every remote place. I discovered that the pile of rocks behind the mountain was densely covered with tombs. Wild roses were blooming luxuriantly, and their fragrance was so strong that I could hardly breathe. Was this nature's pity for those spirits sleeping in the mountains, and deliberately arranged so simply and beautifully? Were the little yellow butterflies dancing gracefully the transformations of the dead? There was not a single tombstone or paper money hanging in the cemetery. Perhaps those buried here were all travelers drifting in a foreign land. In fact, tombstones and paper money are also futile, merely a way for those who live on to seek a very limited self-consolation.</p>
<p>There were some painting opportunities, so visitors came to ask about me, but I didn't welcome them enthusiastically. Although their creations were still quite tame and could be used as material for my writing, these visits ultimately left me feeling extremely exhausted. If the other party didn't ask a question, I wouldn't say a word, listening attentively to their boring monologue, and only humming softly from my nose when it came to an end.</p>
<p>My neighbors, on the other hand, were very kind and friendly. After I had several interactions with them, I was deeply moved by their sincerity and enthusiasm. They devoted themselves to art with the piety of religious converts. Their cultivation was so profound, and their techniques were so skilled. They concentrated their energy and brains on the palette, on the tips of the brushes, and on the canvas. In this spring, when all life was overflowing with vitality and beginning to stir, they painted in the mountains from morning to dusk as if hypnotized. On rainy days and at night, I worked as a model several times, which was also a novel life experience, but as time went on, the expression on my face inevitably became rigid, and the muscles all over my body seemed to gradually tighten. I was most afraid of naughty children deliberately trying to make me laugh. I believe that it is not easy to train an excellent model.</p>
<p>Early summer in the mountain country is not like in Jiangnan. Drinking a cup of clear Longjing tea makes me sweat profusely. The narrowness and crowding of the North Hot Springs swimming pool made me lose interest. I always went to the lakes halfway up the mountain. White sheets were hung in the cedar forest, and a towel blanket was spread on the ground. When I was tired from swimming, I would lie down for a while, listen to the cicadas singing in the dense shade, and eat half a can of canned fruit. Sometimes farmers also came to bathe. Here, everything was like what Qu Yuan wished for, returning to nature. People took off their clothes, revealing their original bodies. Here, there was no division between rich and poor, no boundary between classes, only a comparison between health and weakness. Here, everything was fair.</p>
<p>I often attended the dance performances of Yucai School. "Youth Dance" invariably made every audience cheer wildly. The dance lyrically expressed the life of the Xinjiang Hui people and told the youth's lament of this generation of prairie girls. The aesthetic feeling that "Youth Dance" gave me was the highest degree of aesthetic feeling that dance art could give me.</p>
<p>When the watermelons of Dongshanping grew big and sweet, the owner of the Xuepu Farm invited me to do tasting work for him. I was treated like a machine, trying different varieties of watermelons with different degrees of ripeness one by one, almost numbing my sense of taste. I envied the life of the farm technicians. At night, they slept in thatched sheds and took turns patrolling with steel forks, defending against thieves and wild boars that stole watermelons. They could tell what kind of animal it was by hearing a slight howl, and they could judge the time by looking at the position of the stars.</p>
<p>The Baiwuting Pavilion on the cliff, with wind blowing from all sides, was most suitable for escaping the summer heat. I always played bridge in the pavilion at night. I think bridge is a most gentlemanly entertainment, but it also requires cooperation and tacit understanding. My partner is fixed.</p>
<p>My life in the mountains was very comfortable, although I was almost always sick afterwards. After I returned to Jiangnan this spring, I was constantly reminiscing about the mountains and rivers there. Now, the wisteria on the bamboo fence must be blooming with luxuriant flowers.</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng 14</p>
<p>"Who knew that when I landed, I was a boy, that's me." He turned his head and smiled at me with a mouthful of teeth, "Mom liked it, but Grandpa pulled a long face and scolded me for being a stinky brat and saying I was useless. Mom knew it was all lies: Grandpa really worked hard. From the moment I landed until I was three weeks old, he gave me medicinal water to wash with, from the top of my head to the bottom of my heart, kneading my muscles and bones, rolling medicine bags, everything, he was busy non-stop. Later, he let Mom do it herself, but the old man was still not at ease and had to watch from the side."</p>
<p>"No wonder you're so strong." I looked closely at his arms and legs. Although I couldn't see his muscles bulging, they were round and tight, like a tightly inflated car tire, so tight that they shone. "It's nothing"; he also looked at his own little arms, "Just not afraid of cold, not afraid of heat—when you hit me, no matter what you use, I'm not afraid of pain."</p>
<p>"Did your grandfather teach you martial arts all alone?"</p>
<p>"No, Grandpa only taught qigong, and there were several other masters."</p>
<p>"Did you avenge the revenge?"</p>
<p>"Can't avenge it... His whole family is dead, only a few women and children are left, and they haven't practiced martial arts. Grandpa won't let me go, and my uncle doesn't approve either—our family moved to the village long ago—Uncle taught me to ride horses and use guns. He said that fighting the devils would be revenge."</p>
<p>At this time, the sun was not very high, and we had probably walked more than ten miles. We were just thinking of finding a place to rest before continuing, but we couldn't see a suitable place.</p>
<p>"Is there a tea shed ahead?" We had been walking along small hills and field ridges, and we couldn't see a single person. We had no choice but to ask my little guide, who had run along all the small paths.</p>
<p>"Do you want to have a snack?" He raised the small cloth bag again. "There are steamed buns and cakes inside."</p>
<p>"I don't want to eat, I just want to rest for a while before continuing." Seeing that he had already opened the bag, I knew that he wanted to eat, so I told him to eat while walking.</p>
<p>"I'm not hungry either," although he said that, he had already swallowed twice, "It's not easy to sit here. After passing this small mound, I remember there seems to be a small village." He pointed to a small mound lying in front of us; he was used to calling it a village, but it was probably just a small hamlet.</p>
<p>After walking for about another half an hour, we were almost at the top of the small hill. We were just planning to look around from the top of the hill when, unexpectedly, we suddenly heard a shout in a very rough, gravelly voice with a Japanese accent. Looking up, we saw two Japanese soldiers running onto the hilltop, pointing their guns at us.</p>
<p>This sudden turn of events naturally startled us. We had no choice but to stop and stand there in a daze. Just as I was about to say a few words to them, one soldier gestured for us to retreat, while the other soldier scolded his companion for being a fool, saying that they should capture us and at least search us. Maybe they would find some luck.</p>
<p>Little Tiger, on the other hand, had a completely indifferent expression and just looked at me; a hint of a smile appeared in his big round eyes.</p>
<p>"Brothers, we have orders to do official business," I said politely to the two guys, walking towards them.</p>
<p>"What official business, whose orders?" The one who wanted to try his luck asked, putting away his ferocious look just now.</p>
<p>"I say official business, of course it's official business. Is your officer here?" I had already walked up to them, and Little Tiger was following beside me.</p>
<p>"The officer is right over there," he became polite, probably thinking that I was a fellow countryman, perhaps my Japanese accent and the tone of a high-ranking officer had subdued them.</p>
<p>I followed the tip of the money-grubber's gun and looked towards the foot of the mountain to the north, and I couldn't help but feel a little uneasy, not because I was afraid, but because I was surprised at how quickly they had arrived. Because looking at the layout of this area, from a military point of view, almost the entire Beiping was surrounded by Japanese troops.</p>

<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The first person to receive the "Wendell Willkie One World Flight Award," American broadcaster Norman Corwin, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and spoke at length about his ideal of one world at a press conference.</p>
<p>He said: The definition of "diplomacy" in Webster's Dictionary is "to obtain advantages by skill without incurring ill will or war"; he said: The new definition should be changed to "to establish a country's reputation by skill."</p>
<p>Willkie was a man with lofty ideals. He was visionary, but unfortunately he lost the election in 1941, and even more unfortunately, he died shortly after visiting China and returning to the United States. (Many people say that China seems to be a magic cave, whoever touches it gets bad luck. Willkie came and died after returning, Wallace came and didn't even get elected as vice president, Hurley, Wedemeyer, Chennault, none of them escaped some bad luck. Even Marshall and Stuart Leighton, who are still worrying, are also caught in the trap).</p>
<p>The idea of one world has actually been around for a long time. Confucius, whom we commemorate tomorrow, was its creator. Isn't the Datong chapter of the Book of Rites very concrete and clear? And Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People also inherit this philosophical system. Today, the Christian spirit of the West and the Confucian spirit of the East can be said to be the same ideological system.</p>
<p>Why do human beings engage in intrigue and slaughter, whether it is to gain benefits or gain reputation, cannot be a reason for fighting each other. The real skill that mankind seeks should be to seek abundant food, clothing, and a prosperous life for everyone; the creed that he worships should be "It is better for one's family to have enough than for oneself to have enough." This is the simple truth that Wallace once said, "Everyone in the world should be able to enjoy a few quarts of milk every day."</p>
<p>Looking at reality, we will be shocked by the tension and intensity of the so-called survival competition of human activities. After suffering from neurasthenia, how many people think of their own stupidity and absurdity in the middle of the night!</p>

<h3 id="e134">Selling Belts to Brew Coffee <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Ka</p>
<p>After the Foreign Exchange Relaxation</p>
<p>The day after the foreign exchange was relaxed, Mayor Wu convened a meeting of various trade associations: to stabilize prices. He asked the four major companies and department stores not to raise prices. The greatest help he gave was to ban peddlers. He said: "...Now, most of the peddlers in Shanghai sell foreign goods, and some have capital of more than tens of millions of yuan. This deformed state has damaged department stores, and the government has also suffered losses because they evade taxes... Therefore, the municipal government has ordered that all peddlers selling foreign goods, except for small food stalls, be banned, and must be eradicated before the end of August..."</p>
<p>Indeed, after the victory, foreign goods poured in, and business became deformed; this kind of itinerant peddling that is about to be banned is one example. And the food peddlers who are not in the ban will increase and grow vigorously!</p>
<p>Don't you see, as the sun sets, how many coffee stalls with coarse cloth awnings are setting up seats for you by the side of the street!</p>
<p>If you go out a little later, it's even more flavorful—white tablecloths, white chair covers, reflected even whiter under the bright electric lights; glass drinking utensils are neatly arranged on the table, and Hills Bros coffee, Sullivan's bread, and Chrysanthemum brand milk are neatly arranged in the middle. The price is very cheap. Unlike coffee shops where a cup of coffee costs one dollar, it only costs you hundreds of yuan, and you can also add some milk. Looking at it from a distance, you might think you are in the South, thinking that you have arrived in the Philippines. It must be in Malaya or Java; but in reality, this is the democratization of coffee and toast. This allows a small civil servant to have the ability to taste fine coffee and fulfill his wish for White Pagoda Toast!</p>
<p>Those who sell glass belts must be resentful of the foreign exchange relaxation that broke their rice bowl; those who brew coffee and mix milk must be celebrating that their business is still not in the ban. Truly, this change in foreign exchange has caused so many "some laugh and some weep" situations. However, a person's talent is best shown in times of difficulty, so I believe that the person who sells glass belts is thinking faster than me, and he will quickly liquidate his stock and prepare to raise funds for a coffee stall to maintain his livelihood.</p>
<p>The dumping of coffee is about to embark on the fate of competition, which is not a small blessing for the palates of us civilians; I thank the foreign exchange relaxation!</p>

<p>— Common Scientific Knowledge</p>
<p>Not long ago, a small news item appeared in the newspaper stating that the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau conducted spot checks on food and found that a certain well-known soy sauce brand was nothing more than a mixture of "coloring" and salt water. We know that "coloring" is actually a coloring agent brewed from soybean dregs, grain husks, and the like, without any nutritional value. If manufactured using scientific methods, "coloring" can be odorless and, when diluted with water, will have the same color as soy sauce, but will taste like plain water.</p>
<p>Here, the writer does not want to specifically criticize such unscrupulous merchants; consumers should also bear some responsibility.</p>
<p>There is a foreign proverb that says, "Ninety-nine cents for a bottle," meaning that the consumer spends ninety-nine cents of every dollar on the bottle's label, decoration, and advertising, while the actual product inside the bottle is only worth one cent. This is a very common consumer mentality, and most consumers are willing to waste money in this way.</p>
<p>If an honest merchant were to cook sweet potatoes until soft, add red food coloring and sugar vinegar, etc., and honestly call it "Sweet Potato Sauce," no one would pay attention to it in the market. A cunning manufacturer, using the same ingredients, would process them, seal them in glass bottles, and stick on a three-color, finely printed label with two or three bright red tomatoes prominently displayed, and then could justifiably call it Tomato Sauce. There are many, many examples like this. In the last decade or two, due to the significant progress of organic chemistry, many non-toxic pigments that can be ingested have been invented one after another, which has undoubtedly fueled this kind of deception and trickery.</p>
<p>Of course, foreign countries also have their "bugs." Here, I can give an extreme example.</p>
<p>There is a very famous canned food factory in the United States that produces grape juice, which, according to what it says on the can, tastes no different from fresh grape juice when mixed with eight parts water. I poked a hole in the can, and the liquid that poured out was just like purple ink, clearly dyed with the organic pigment "Methyl Violet." I used a very simple chemical method to prove that my guess was correct, and that this purple pigment was exactly the same as the pigment used in our "copying pencils," purple carbon paper, and purple printing ink. Not only am I eating pigment, but later I thought about it and realized it was quite ridiculous: fresh purple grapes only have purple skin, and the juice inside is not purple at all. The squeezed grape juice should be colorless, so how could it be as dark as purple printing ink? Thinking about this, my appetite was cut in half!</p>
<p>There are many more ridiculous things. As we all know, saccharin is often used in sweets instead of white sugar. Saccharin is also an organic compound, a small white crystalline granule with a bitter taste, but when diluted in a large amount of water, it has a strong sweet taste. Many people believe that it is harmful to eat, but in fact, science has long proven that saccharin only "travels" through the stomach once and is neither beneficial nor harmful to humans. The intestines and stomach do not absorb it, so it will inevitably be excreted "intact" sooner or later. This is not nonsense: if needed, a chemist could use a not-so-difficult procedure to find the saccharin you ate yesterday in your excrement, and then have it travel through your mouth and stomach countless times! Each time it would still be just as "sweet"!…</p>
<p>Eating pigment, eating sugar that isn't absorbed by the body—for these absurd eating habits, it seems we can only offer this "self-deprecating" explanation: eating is a pleasure, including for the tongue and the eyes. The saying "the eyes eat ice cream" has a basis. How much money is wasted on "food" that cannot be eaten!</p>
<h3 id="e136">Schools Going to the Countryside: Not a High-Pitched Tune <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Shan</p>
<p>To improve the current education in Shanghai, I would like to boldly contribute a method here: move a large number of Shanghai schools to the rural areas on the outskirts of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The reason is very simple and will surely be agreed upon.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the negative reasons. Shanghai, a crowded city, a decadent city, cannot be said to be the best educational environment. Because of the population density, Shanghai has become a land where every inch is worth its weight in gold. Even if the school's leader is truly a cultivated, idealistic, pure-willed, and passionate educator who is determined to dedicate their life to the education of the next generation, even such schools and educators would still have no way to obtain ideal school buildings. This is why most schools in Shanghai have become "alley schools" and "road schools." In such school buildings, students' breathing must struggle with dirty and stuffy air, their eyesight must fight with dim or insufficient light, and their hearing must resist the noise of streetcars and hawkers. In fact, many students cannot escape the fate of becoming victims of tuberculosis, nearsightedness, or hysteria. As for the widespread existence of decadence, it is rare for children and young people, who are particularly susceptible to imitation and perception, to avoid the consequences of being contaminated after being exposed to it.</p>
<p>Now let's discuss the positive reasons. The rural areas on the outskirts of Shanghai have vast spaces, fresh air, beautiful natural scenery, and simple folk customs. All of these indicate the excellence of the environment, which is an ideal place to cultivate character, strengthen physical fitness, and study knowledge.</p>
<p>Based on the above two reasons, I dare to loudly call on educators: stop circling within the streets of Shanghai. We want to go to the suburbs of Shanghai to develop educational gardens; at the same time, I dare to loudly call on the parents of students: Mencius's mother choosing a neighborhood is a wise measure, and we must send our children to study in the suburbs of Shanghai.</p>
<p>For educators, this is a touchstone of creativity; for parents of students, it is a measure of discernment. However, the discernment of parents of students must be inspired by the creativity of educators. Therefore, the creativity of educators should be the driving force behind the "schools going to the countryside" movement.</p>
<p>In the admission advertisements of many schools in Shanghai, I found the advertisement of the newly established East China Vocational School. I heard that all the equipment of the school was inherited from the former East China United Middle School. The school was founded by Mr. Zhao Chuanjia, Chen Tianyu, and others. The school is located in the countryside of Zhenru in the western suburbs of Shanghai and has a self-built school building, which can be regarded as the pioneer of the recent school going to the countryside movement in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Here, I wish the school going to the countryside movement great success!</p>

<h3 id="e138">Regarding the Embezzlement Case at the Railway Bureau <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Chong Zheng</p>
<p>Two opinions: (1) Yu Xiangyan should step forward; (2) I hope to hear the sequel!</p>
<p>The "legal protagonist" of the railway bureau embezzlement case is, of course, Chief Zhang Hongtu, but Chief Zhang pushed the suspicion of embezzlement onto his wife, Yu Xiangyan. However, Yu is as untraceable as the Yellow Crane, making it impossible to arrest her. Before Yu can be brought to justice, this embezzlement case that has attracted national attention cannot be fully revealed for the time being.</p>
<p>I think that although Yu Xiangyan is the wife of a chief, she cannot use her power in the railway bureau to greatly develop her career. What does she rely on to carry out this huge embezzlement case? It is inevitable to be suspicious.</p>
<p>If I were Yu Xiangyan, regardless of whether I was wronged or not, I would definitely step forward; if Mr. Zhang's confession is true, then one person should be responsible for their own actions, not implicating others or their husband. My conscience would not allow it, and the law would not allow you to be at large; if Chief Zhang has falsely accused you, or even escaped to help him relieve his troubles and act as a puppet, then not only will your reputation be ruined, but the entire women's world will be tarnished!</p>
<p>In the women's world, after thousands of years of enduring the feudal era, even today, when women's rights are being promoted, the remaining poison cannot be completely eliminated, and obstacles cannot be completely removed; if we are given the title of not having a share in being an official but being the protagonist of embezzlement, it is really unwilling—(Jin Jing)</p>
<p>I often feel that things always start with a bang but end with a whimper. For example, during the "August 13th" Shanghai battle, everyone's emotions were so high, especially the eight hundred heroic soldiers of the isolated army who defended the Sihang Warehouse, and everyone praised him at the time, but now his orphans are crying for food, and no one cares.</p>
<p>The embezzlement case of more than 100 million yuan in the two railway bureaus, which caused a sensation in Shanghai, has been going on for more than a month, but now there is no follow-up. I remember that when it first happened, everyone was angry and indignant and unanimously believed that it should be dealt with severely. And our authorities will definitely not ignore it.</p>
<p>Although the trial of the case now has its fixed legal procedures, we should not overstep our authority to interfere, but we always hope that in the intentional or unintentional delay, the big things will be reduced to small things, and the small things will be reduced to nothing. I hope not to disappoint the 3.5 million citizens!</p>
<p>I remember that after the embezzlement case in the two railway bureaus, a 100 million yuan embezzlement case also occurred in the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and it is still without a follow-up. Is this just a coincidence? Here, we just hope for a quick and serious resolution!</p>

<p>—The Dictator of Yugoslavia (Part 1)</p>
<p>Amid the worsening relations between South America, Tito, the dictator of Yugoslavia, has become an international figure attracting worldwide attention. Only by knowing his origins and background can we understand why Yugoslavia would brazenly provoke this enormous wave. Major Temple H. Fielding of the U.S. Army, who was stationed in Yugoslavia with the U.S. military mission during the war and stayed for several months, had close contacts with Tito and his subordinates. The following is his report on everything about Tito:</p>
<p>Tito is the Marshal of Yugoslavia, the Supreme Commander of the National Liberation Army, and the Secretary-General of the Communist Party. He is one of the most dynamic figures in the Balkans. In terms of appearance, he is very seductive in every word and smile. He fully demonstrates the attractiveness of his personality in his interactions with people.</p>
<p>He looks just like a college professor. He is short and fat, with full muscles. He is fifty-three years old this year. He speaks gently and has a scholarly demeanor. With a pair of green eyes and messy hair, from an American point of view, he often needs a haircut.</p>
<p>From the photos published in the newspapers, Tito seems to be a very serious person. But in reality, he smiles more often than he frowns. He likes to chat and is very humorous. Once, when Fielding was dining with him, he fell because the chair wasn't sitting properly. Tito actually burst out laughing. He looked just like Mickey Mouse!</p>
<p>Tito's uniform is quite neat, but not too exaggerated. On the left chest hangs the partisan medal that Tito awarded to himself, and on the right chest hangs the Soviet Suvorov silver star medal. He is always accompanied by a group of guards and a female translator, Olga Ninchitch Humo. Tito's second wife, Herta, is a Slovak peasant woman and does not live with him in the camp.</p>
<p>Tito has a strange temper, which is his cold attitude towards English. He himself understands four or five foreign languages, but his English is also very poor. His speeches are not very good, his tone is peaceful, and he often uses nasal sounds. But his personal seductiveness covers up these shortcomings. So, as soon as he opens his mouth, the audience is hysterically persuaded by him.</p>
<p>Speaking of his background and pre-war activities, the following is a brief summary: Tito was born in Croatia. His father was a blacksmith, and his mother was a peasant woman, both of whom were illiterate. In 1914, Tito was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army. But he surrendered to the Russian army at the front. Later, because he opposed fighting for the Tsar, he was exiled to Siberia. After the Bolshevik Party came to power, he was released in 1917. He then joined the Communist Party. He was tempered in the whirlpool of the Great Revolution for three years. From 1920 to 1923, he was left at a secret training school in Moscow. There, foreign communists were rigorously trained to overthrow their capitalist governments. At the age of twenty-eight, he had become a staunch and disciplined Communist Party member and was then sent back to Croatia. At that time, he served as the leader of the metalworkers' union and carried out large-scale activities. As a result, he was arrested and imprisoned. He was not released until five years later. After this experience, his attitude became stronger, and he felt that his enemies must be mercilessly eliminated. Since then, he has engaged in underground work and become an active Communist Party cadre.</p>
<p>Important Communist Party Figure</p>
<p>For the next thirteen years, Tito seemed to be completely unknown. Some reports said that he had served as a cadre of the Third International and was the highest representative of Stalin sent to the Balkans. But later, this report was denied. Observers familiar with the situation believe that this denial is correct because the Soviet military intelligence agency is a completely independent spy organization and keeps secrets so that even the Third International does not know much about its activities. Of course, Tito is an important Communist Party cadre. He is unknown in the orthodox faction, and he has also spied for the Soviet Union. He admitted that he had secretly returned to the Soviet Union several times between 1929 and 1939.</p>
<p>Hitler attacked Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941. Hundreds of resistance groups rose up to resist. But Tito and the Communist Party members did not participate in the resistance with guns. Two months later, after Germany attacked the Soviet Union on the same day, their guerrillas began to fight. Tito later explained that this delay was for technical convenience, and he also argued that his men were fully organized by then.</p>
