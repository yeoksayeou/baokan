<h3>軍事三人昨晨晤談　對關內外共軍越軌行動　馬徐面請周速設法制止</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕軍事三人會之會前商談，自昨晚徐永昌將軍與周恩來在梅園新村晤面，直接交換意見後，已具體化，但雙方對東北問題，停戰整軍問題，恢復交通問題之意見，尚有若干距離，遂相約於今日上午至寗海路五號馬歇爾官邸就商於馬使。今晨十時前，徐·周先後至馬使官邸，與馬使一度商談後，旋由馬使會同徐·周二人，就各項待決之難題，正式交換意見。但據馬使官邸中人聲稱：今日軍事三人小組會，三方代表雖已晤面商談，但非正式會議。聞今午後徐永昌將軍曾晋謁主席，並聞今日馬·徐曾面請周恩來迅速設法制止關內外共軍之越軌行為，恢復七日中午十二時以前之原態勢，免碍談判，如此次獲有結果，軍事三人會有立刻舉行之可能。又邵力子十二日晨由滬返抵京。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十二日電〕馬歇爾將軍今日先與周氏會談半小時，旋又往主席官邸謁見主席，談兩時之久。會談議題乃十五日停戰協定期滿後，有否準備永久解決辦法之附增計劃或任何方式，但不致有所發表。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十二日電〕據多數觀察家意見，馬歇爾特使在華使命之最後成敗，將於今後十日內決定之。熟悉中國國情與民情之多數人士均謂，在本月廿二日停戰令滿期以前，馬使對永久停戰之努力，如不能產生合理的希望，則將返國。同時亦有多數人士力言，馬使不能促成中國內政問題之迅速與持久的解決，中國上下一致承認，馬使為國共糾紛長最適當之調人，馬使若果失敗，決非其本人之過失或能力之不足，當純為問題過於迷惑難解。一般人對於國共永久和平問題，敢言其最後有望者，大約五人中不過一人，馬使對於奔走幹旋，不辭勞怨，足證明其本人並不作如是觀。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕靑年黨中常委李璜，昨晨由京返滬，下午曾召集該黨主要人員舉行黨務會議。民盟方面沈鈞儒，張君勱，黃炎培，章伯鈞等，昨晨曾對東北最近局勢有所檢討，並由張君勱，黃炎培具函，邀請靑年黨李璜於今午三時在張宅交換意見，並將邀莫德惠參加。</p>
<h3>杜聿明由瀋抵長　行前通知共軍退出拉法並停止進攻　否則中共應負一切責任</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十二日電〕東北保安司令長官杜聿明將軍，十二日午十一時廿五分由瀋專專機抵長，下機後乘車逕赴梁主席官邸休息，杜長官宣稱：此次來長，在代表蔣主席慰問東北同胞，並徵詢東北父老之意見，以期迅速達成綏靖地方，安定民生之目的。杜氏並稱：自政府接收東北以來，渠此次來長為第三次，若時間允許，將赴各地慰問並視察。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十一日電〕軍調部政府代表蔡宗濂，十一日陪同長春執行分部，中共代表饒漱石謁杜長官，會談約半小時，杜長官於奉到東北停止追擊前進命令後，則軍各部隊，七日十二時已完全停止前進，而共軍竟乘機襲擊國軍各地，均似為有計劃之行動，尤以拉法附近，集中主力攻擊，致國軍一團蒙受損失，特向饒漱石提出，希望立即電吿前方，在十二日午間，必須退出拉法，停止一切攻擊行動，否則引起意外之一切不幸事件，均應由中共負責。饒氏則謂：東北停戰命令，僅在報紙閱及，而中共方面始終未接到正式命令。此次停戰命令為舉國共和之事實，中共高級人員實不容否認。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十一日電〕共軍自七日圍攻拉法新舊站以來，迭次增兵，並斷國軍後路，截至十日止，已增至步兵二十一個團，砲兵一個團，日傾全力猛攻，更以重砲，山砲，向拉法集中射擊，致全區大火，房屋盡燬，國軍當恪遵命令，嚴守信義，並未增援反撲，而駐守該地之國軍一團，以孤軍對抗，衆寡懸殊，被迫撤至小孤家子冪化之綫，團長危耀東陣亡，所有官佐士兵傷亡過半。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十二日電〕軍調部長春分部政府方面工作人員周勵武少將等十餘人，十二日晨七時專機離平飛往長春，刻政府及美方工作人員，已先後羣集長春，俟中共方面工作人員到達後，即可於長春展開調處工作。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十二日電〕軍事調處執行部政府及美方代表，今日對中共方面所傳，東北保安司令杜聿明已通知軍調部，謂其所部已復取攻勢，並聲明十五日停戰協定已無效各節，加以否認。</p>
<h3>京積極籌備參議員選舉</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕京市已積極籌備參議員選舉事宜，茲悉參議員選出人數，依法規定凡十萬人口以上者，應選出區域代表十九人，逾此每三萬增一人，刻據四月份統計，京市人口已達七·零三九零六人，應有代表三十九人，再加職業代表十七人，共為五十六人。聞是項工作可於八月間開始舉辦。</p>
<h3>彭部長答外記者問　目前時局極嚴重　美方代表必須有仲裁權力　否則一切協定將徒托空言</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕外記者招待會，十二日下午四時半舉行，由彭部長學沛，劉次長鍇主持，茲錄主要問答如次：</p>
<p>問，共產黨說政府停止衝突命令發出時，在中國東部開始大規模之攻擊，如此說屬實，政府為何在此永久協定行將成立時，採取此種攻擊之行動？</p>
<p>答（彭部長），此是共產黨宣傳之老辦法，即以自己所作之惡行，反棄於對方，究竟何方發動攻擊，極易證明。在六月七日前，拉法與德州原在政府軍手中，而現在則在共軍手中，停止軍事行動命令發出後三小時，共軍即攻擊拉法，隨即大舉進攻德州，屠殺無數政府軍隊及地方人民。六月九日共軍炸燬魯蘇邊境運河上之韓莊大橋，共軍正在集中軍隊，企圖進攻濟南，靑島，共軍之策略，顯明是想利用此十五日之休戰期間，儘量攻佔城市，他們尤其想奪取山東全省，劃中國為南北兩部分，加强國民經濟之危險，此種作風，令人想起來栖三郎在華盛頓之使命，余願喚起全國注意目前時局之嚴重，共軍必須撤退其在六月七日以後所佔之城市，並迅速恢復其所破壞之交通路綫，方能除去談判之極大障礙。有人說攻擊拉法，德州等地是六月七日以前所下之命令，因電報遲延，致未及停止，吾人即退讓一百步，假定此說不虛，並且不計政府軍隊與無辜人民之損失，仍覺共黨極易證明其誠意，最簡單方法，即為撤退六月七日以後所强佔之城市，否則難辭破壞停戰協定之責任。許多觀察家認為：共黨之策略，為全面拖延，局部滲透，最近之事情，均證實此說之不謬。政府軍隊已奉主席命令，祇可防守，不得攻擊，且於取回被奪之地點後，不得追擊。</p>
<p>問，關於政府與共黨間之談判，可否請酌予中途之報吿，以判明各種謠言？</p>
<p>答（彭部長），近來談判之中心問題，為如何保證一切協定迅速有效實施，而避免如此之拖延，因此，政府堅持美方代表必須有仲裁之權力，此種建議，乃我方所自動提出，如無此種仲裁，則一切協定將徒託空言，永難實現。共黨在周恩來將軍從延安返京後，仍拒絕此種建議，吾人猶憶吾人曾建議，凡調處執行部之派出小組，三人中衹須二人同意，即可決定，此點，共黨亦加反對，如此枝節橫生，爭執不已，協定何有實現之望。關於仲裁權力，政府並吿知共方，如有更好辦法，儘可提出商量，但共方迄未提出任何辦法。</p>
<p>問，三人會議將解決政治糾紛乎？抑係軍事衝突乎？</p>
<p>答（彭部長），十五日期間，必須解決三項最切迫之問題，即停止衝突，恢復交通及整編統編軍隊，此等問題解決之後，其他政治問題，不難迎刃而解，而况大部份已經政治協商會議解決。</p>
<h3>華北局勢愈趨緊張　各地將領急電國防部請示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕今為停戰有效期間第六日，侵晨即傳大汶口又被共軍攻入，華北局勢愈趨緊張，聞李宗仁，劉峙，孫連仲，閻錫山，傅作義，王耀武等各將領，曾先後急電國防部報吿，因共軍大舉進犯造成之嚴重局勢，並請示應付辦法。據聞此次華北共軍發動之廣泛攻勢其糾集之兵力，裝備之武器，以及配合地面部隊作戰，飄忽無常之日式轟炸機，事前似均已有充分準備，極堪注意。目前各地國軍最感困難者，即在停戰限期以內，須絕對採取守勢，且因守之地甚多。防不勝防，如共軍集中兵力擇定一點猛攻，國軍因措手不及，吃虧甚大，關外之拉法，關內之德州，守軍均有慘烈犧牲，即因處於挨打之不利地位，故目前各地國軍將士之情緒，已因怒火中燒，備極憤鬰。據軍界某要員云：此點可供中共參考，勿取快一時，自貽伊戚。</p>
<h3>棗莊指揮官被俘</h3>
<p>〔中央社徐州十一日電〕棗莊守軍指揮官王綱已被共軍俘去，部隊長王繼美戰死。</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南十二日電〕晏城交通小組政府代表雷奮强少校，十日在桑梓店附近，被共軍射殺，現雷氏屍體，業於今晨界抵濟南車站。按雷氏係第二綏靖區司令部少校參謀，年僅廿餘，今遭此慘殺，殊堪哀悼。雷氏此次返濟，所携除在晏城會商決議案外，尚有六月七日至九日間共軍三次破壞鐵路之詳細情形記錄。</p>
<h3>犯靑島共軍擊退</h3>
<p>〔中央社靑島十二日電〕共軍圍攻靑市日急，十二日夜十時許，又有帆船二十餘隻集中，向中區進攻，企圖登陸，經守軍與海軍合力擊退。又靑島即墨邊境，十二日晚亦發生激戰。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十二日電〕濰縣，高密，即墨，城陽等地共軍，八日夜向國軍進犯，刻在激戰中。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島十二日電〕進攻城陽共軍經兩日激戰，已被擊退，共軍現集結主力於城陽北五公里董大觀一帶，與我對峙中。</p>
<h3>柯克昨飛京商靑島局勢</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕美第七艦隊司令柯克海軍上將，十二日晨自滬飛抵京。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕美駐華海軍總司令柯克上將，以魯境共軍擴大叛亂，似有準備於旦夕間進攻靑島模樣，昨（十二日）晨專機自滬飛京，與馬歇爾特使有重要會商。一般預測，柯克將軍可能在京公畢後赴靑島一行，與前日自天津飛靑島之美駐華海軍陸戰隊司令駱基將軍及美駐靑島海軍陸戰隊司令克里門將軍等會商，尋求適應環境因地制宜之妥當方法。此間美海軍當局對靑島方面之美海軍對當前危急局勢採取何種態度與行動，拒絕討論，但稱：寗島美海軍將領現正在商洽中，渠等不願任人攻擊，適應靑島局勢之決策，可能在洽商後宣布。美海軍對共軍之突然進攻魯境，頗表訝異，但靑島美海軍陸戰隊現正使用市北之飛機塲及市東之船塢，對外運絡如前。</p>
<h3>陳立夫談話　接收東北基於中蘇條約</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕今日下午，中央組織部部長陳立夫氏，曾在于斌歡迎田樞機主教之會塲上，為若干記者所包圍，詢以對停戰公吿發布後之當前局勢，有何感想，據陳氏稱，停戰如捨整編軍隊與恢復交通而談，則係徒托空方，而關內與關外之戰爭，乃兩件事，關外國軍，乃基於中蘇條約，前往接收，譬如主權屬我之一幢房屋，理應接收，而竟有人踞以不讓，自當囑警察逐之出也。</p>
<h3>中常會議通過要案　中訓團攻隸政院　陳城辭教育長薛岳繼任</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕中常會第卅二次會議於十二日上午九時舉行，由鄒委員魯主席，到常委孫科，陳果夫·白崇禧·梁寒操·陳立夫·朱家驊·吳鐵城·賀衷寒·張勵生·李文範·宋子文·段錫朋·劉健羣·朱霽靑·蕭同茲·賴瑼·田崑山·蕭錚·白雲梯·王啓江·鄧文儀·柳克述·列席監委及各部會首長吳敬恒·張繼·邵力子·程天放·賀耀組·姚大海·劉文島·林雲陔·李文齋·鄭彥棻·彭學沛等卅餘人，決議各案商誌如次：（一）通過省市執委會主任委員選舉規則，（二）通過中央訓練委員會業務結束後移交辦法，今後中央訓練團改隸行政院，原任教育長陳誠辭職照准，由薛岳繼任。（三）通過一中全會決議案實施督導辦法等　，十二時散會。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕二中全會三月杪在渝舉行後，卽値遷都開始，各機關紛紛遷京，現初步還都工作完成，中央為使全會決議各案，能早日實施，特由中常會第卅一次會議，推定李文範·吳鐵城·梁寒操·段錫朋·白雲梯·朱霽靑·賀衷寒·李宗黃·王啓江等九委員，為二中全委決議案督導實施委會委員，並推李文範·吳鐵城·梁寒操為召集人，該會十一日舉行第一次督導會議，出席委員李文範·吳鐵城·梁寒操·賀衷寒·朱霽靑·李宗黃·王啓江等七人，由李文範主席，當通過：（一）二中全會決議案實施督導辦法，及督導注意事項。（二）全會決議案，分為黨務·政治·邊疆問題·經濟·財政·軍事·外交·交通·糧食救濟等九組，每組由一督道委員負責督導。（三）各組督導幹事，由中央各部會處，中央設計局，中央黨政工作考核委會，高級職員中遴調，（四）建議常會加推在京委員參加，以利督導工作進行等要案。又各委員僉以過去中央決議各案，各機關多未能澈底認眞執行，決建議常會於必要時，約請各機關首長列席常會，報吿籍供諮詢，各機關執行情形成果，並將由督導委會隨時考核，報吿常會。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕中央日報今日以「決定的日子」為題，論述國共停戰問題，該報認為提高馬歇爾將軍之仲裁權，為達到國共兩軍和平之最後一條道路，並謂共軍若在此時攻下濟南或依舊阻礙東北接收，應認為該黨叛亂之開始，該報又主張共黨在任何地點襲擊國軍，國軍應即予以反擊，但反攻至原防綫時，仍應停止前進，等候最好調處。文中指出「截至今天為止，共產黨並無絲亳停戰迹象，其變本加厲的軍事行動，正與其混淆黑白的宣傳攻勢互相配合，停戰期間，現在只剩十日，共產黨尚未能以事實證明其停戰的誠意，這對於殷切企求和平統一的中國人民，固是無情的打擊，對於不遠三萬里為中國和平統一而來的馬歇爾將軍，豈不也是很大的諷刺。共產黨豈不知人民之希望和平，有甚于飢嬰之待哺乳，豈不知馬歇爾將軍乃至全世界中國的友人之望中國安定，有甚于大旱之望雲霓，又豈不知人民和政府的忍耐都有其限度，然則何以不肯馬上放棄分裂東北，支解中國，破壞交通，屠殺人民的企圖。難道共產黨眞是別具心腸的一種人，早已失去正常的人性。往者已矣，來者可追，我們希望共產黨為國家珍惜收回不易的主權，為人民留下一綫的生機，體諒政府容忍之不能無限度，重視馬歇爾將軍為中國和平統一不遠三萬里而調處的友情，從速放棄其暴力主義，强權政治的觀點，收起全面叛變的企圖，停止在東北和山東的瘋狂進攻。今後的十天，是決定的日子，因為它是整個民族全體　民的十字街頭，也是共產黨是否肯為整個民族留一條生路，為全體國民留一綫生機的分歧點」。</p>

<h3>何應欽由台飛返滬　視察歸來暢談觀感　人才缺乏望國人共謀建設</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕何應欽氏日前自滬飛台灣視察，逗留五日，已於昨日中午十二時四十分，自台返滬，何氏拒談軍事問題，記者詢以對大局之觀感，何氏則稱，不欲作何批評，渠對軍調處之工作，亦不願發表意見。記者詢以何日出國參加聯合國軍事參謀長會議，氏稱日期尙未確定，本月內恐未能啓行，但總部之職責均已移交妥當，定今日或明日回南京，出國前將到東北及西北視察，以期明瞭戰後國內之各方情况。此次赴台灣全屬視察性質，記者請求視察台灣所得發表意見，何氏稱，本人此次赴台灣參觀，留台五日，計到台北·基隆·新竹·台中·嘉義·台南·高雄等七個地方，觀感所及，約有數端：（一）日人五十年來對台灣的經營，無論軍事政治經濟交通，以及農林工礦各項建設，均有相當成功，而且每一事業，都是規模宏大，計劃週密，其處心積慮，和努力的精神，實在値得我們警惕。（二）台灣同胞的國家觀念，民族意識，都極濃厚，雖在五十年異族統治之下，但並未忘懷祖國，亦未被異族同化，此種精神，極足感慰。（三）台灣目前最重要之工作與困難問題有兩點：一，是教育問題，日人對台灣所施的殖民地式教育，我人不能不承認對於一部份台胞，有若干不良的影響，今欲肅淸遺毒，教育問題非常重要，但以往日本限制台灣人進師範學校，所以師資—尤其是中等以上學校師資，非常缺乏，希望國內同胞，多多赴台服務敎育。二，是恢復交通與生產事業問題，台灣本島以及本島與外間之交通，以往均極發達，在戰爭期中，水陸的交通工具，損失破壞甚重，各項生產事業，除了一部份破壞外，又因以往全操日人之手，現在日僑大多遺送回國，故人材非常缺乏，現在要圖　　靠台省自身力量，尙屬不够，希國內專家實業家與海外僑胞，共同協助，中央主管部門亦宜特別予以贊助，以期早日恢復。總之，台灣土地肥沃，物產豐饒，又經日人經營，奠定了基礎，祇須我人努力，極易復興繁榮，望同胞將眼光移向台灣，共謀新台灣的建設與繁榮。</p>

<h3>坦其隆大屠殺案　我向荷蘭提抗議　吧城華僑一致停市誌哀</h3>

<h3>昆明銀根趨鬆</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明十一日電〕昆市銀根十日起已趨鬆緩，但因受上週頭寸緊縮影響，致有少數銀行仍非廠業不拆放，並因貨帮提款者頗多，故一部份小銀行仍緊縮放款，滙市以申渝兩地較多，中央銀行現對申滙採取統籌辦法，各行莊如因事實之需要，可盡量供應。昆市派資自十日起又趨向黃金拖拉，價已由廿二萬八千升至廿三萬五千元，棉紗隨金價而上升，布疋貨多無法脫手，價將下落，香烟供過於求，行市趨跌。</p>
<h3>社論　共軍竟如此停戰！</h3>
<p>停戰！停戰！這是人民的呼籲，也是友邦的期望。十五天的停戰！這是政府的命令，更其是共黨所同意的辦法。當十五天停戰今生效之日，我們誠懇的呼籲雙方切莫再錯過這個機會。然而，事實所給我們的答覆，太使我們失望了！共軍的答復是東北砲聲的再響，是山東境內大規模的襲擊，是充分利用日寇和日寇的武器來攻擊國軍，來爭奪城市，來破壞交通。異哉！共軍竟如此停戰！</p>
<p>然而，不必詫異，共軍如此停戰，實在還是共黨的老戲法。我們早就說過，要有信用，纔可談判，談判纔有價値。如今一談再談，邊打邊談，邊談邊打，談判又有何用？共軍倘始終想把談判作爲攻擊的間歇時期，或作爲突襲的掩護幌子，那麼根本就無所謂停戰。共軍在中國共產黨的最高决策之下，百變不離其宗，似乎以阻止中國在一個統一的國民政府之下强大起來爲惟一目的，故甚至敵人不妨利用，敵人的武器也大可利用，只要能給國民政府以相　麻煩，能使國民政府不克順利接收東北，能讓國民政府不得恢復全國的交通，從而使人民不能得到安居樂業的起碼條件，共軍什麽事情都可以幹出來的。換言之，共軍這幾天在關外的猛攻拉法，進窺永吉，在山東的攻陷德州，猛襲泰安，膠縣，濰縣，高密等地，甚至有襲擊濟南，靑島，徐州的模樣，在在顯示共軍簡直不但不停戰，並且正走和停戰相反的道路，天天在那裏加緊戰鬥，擴大戰區。</p>
<p>共軍一面由其在長春春代表饒漱石盲布，並未接到停戰命令，以爲破壞停戰協定，不是東北共軍之咎，而另一面則由周恩來飛延安，飛南京拜會馬歇爾將軍，今天訪這一黨，明天約那一派，做得來似乎熱望和平惟有共黨，以圖迷惑世人的耳目。若干以標榜中立自詡的少數政客，也根本忘記了人民的地位，漠視了人民的痛苦，尤其丟開了正義和公道，只知道跟在共黨後面喊停戰喊和平，殊不知他們所喊的停戰與和平早已爲共黨共軍和共軍所包庇下的殘餘日寇踢到九霄雲外去了。老實說，共軍如此停戰，休想欺騙一個眼睛雪亮的眞正老百姓。我們老百姓，在此時有一個最簡單的看法，就是在十五天的停戰期內，那一方還動手先打，就是人民的公敵，國家的罪人！</p>
<p>說到這裏我們願意以報人的地位，爲眞正的老百姓再作一次痛切的呼籲：</p>
<p>第一，我們先責備賢者，所以我們還是懇求政府嚴令各地的國軍，恪遵停戰協定，恪守停戰命令，縱使共軍天天挑戰，處處襲擊，國軍爲保護人民，捍衛地方起見，不能不加以還擊，但這種反攻應絕對以防守原防線爲止境，使中外人士都能明瞭釁由誰啓，使馬歇爾將軍所指揮的最後調處還能有進行的機會。</p>
<p>第二，我們本着「與人爲善」的旨趣，還是期望共黨能够懸崖勒馬。此時共黨應認識其時代使命在促成中國的統一强大，而不是造成分裂割據以至於削弱中國的力量。共黨應知此十五天的停戰，確爲共黨改變作風的唯一良機。如果共黨此時還是阻撓東北的統一接收，甚至用武力來佔奪濟南靑島徐州等城市，我們老百姓就只有認定共軍是蓄意叛亂的一羣匪徒，而不能再視爲政府還可與之談判的什麽軍隊。</p>
<p>第三，我們以為政府和中共的一切談判，必須在完全停戰的氛圍中方可進行，而進行期間，必須尊重第三者的仲裁意見。此所謂第三者，决不是少數冒充民主的政客，而應該是客觀超然的馬歇爾將軍，尤其該應是身受戰爭痛苦的中國老百姓。我們以爲此後談判要求其有效，要求其能强有力，必須先賦予馬歇爾將軍以仲裁權，而於必要時，應該讓國民參政會和各省市參議會互選出眞正人民的代表，組織最高仲裁團？來對政府與中共的爭執下一個最後的裁判。誰服從這裁判，老百姓就擁護誰；誰反對這裁判，老百姓就羣起而攻。我們相信，在政府和中共互有爭執的期間，要使國家獲得和平，祇有尊重人民和馬歇爾將軍的仲裁權力，這一條路。那一方面反對或漠視人民的仲裁權的，就是不民主，也就是它不願意和平的表徵。人民對於這些反民主反和平的拯救主義者，最後一定會有對付的辦法！</p>

<h3>外長會議重開之前　貝文作重要表示　會議如失敗即單獨行動　主將魯爾區交國際管理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十二日廣播：英外相貝文在工黨年會席上表示意見稱：茍未來外長會議依然失敗，則渠擬與前軸心國及其歐洲衛星國家單獨簽訂和約。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十二日廣播：英外相貝文今日在工黨年會席上發表演說，推翻反對派之批評。渠曾就巴勒斯坦·蘇聯·及西班牙問題，發表重要聲明：（一）關於巴勒斯坦問題，彼不願猶太人十萬名進入該區，因如照辦，英軍勢須多駐一師於該方面。（二）關於蘇聯，彼措辭更為强硬。貝氏列舉已往彼對蘇聯之友好行動，但今日已知蘇聯之忘情。渠指出最近蘇聯報紙對於彼之外交演說，竟一字不提，凡事必須出諸雙方誠意，今蘇聯如此，又復何言。（三）關於西班牙，貝氏認為倘別國不干涉西班牙內政，弗朗哥或許早已倒台。貝氏不主張對西班牙採取經濟制裁之方法，因受害者為西班牙平民而已。</p>
<p>貝氏對於德國問題亦曾有所論列。謂：法國要求分割魯爾，此種立塲，渠亦瞭解其苦衷，因法國曾遭德國侵略三次，為求安全計，不得不出此一策。然據貝氏意見，魯爾工業區應置於國際管理之下，因如此不惟對當地之六百六十萬民衆有利，最後歐洲各國亦將共蒙其益。</p>
<p>貝氏對於美國所提四總締結二十五年互助條約，以監視德國之解除武裝一點，表示歡迎。渠云：若干方面以為吾人正在設法成立西方集團，但事實上東方集團早已存在，然貝氏不主張採助此種辦法，以致造成壁疊。</p>

<p>英國向美詢問六點</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十一日電〕美國國務卿貝爾納斯十一日發表談話稱：英國就履行巴勒斯坦報吿書建議一事所提出之六點詢問，今已由美駐英大使哈里曼提交任命組織之內閣委員會加以硏究。貝爾納斯雖未得確實之情報，惟相信英國對六點詢問獲得滿意之答覆後，當將履行容許十萬猶太人遷入巴勒斯坦一項建議。英國所提六點詢問如次：（一）倘因移民而使巴勒斯坦發生混亂事件，則美國將予以何種協助加以敉平？（二）歐洲每一無家可歸之猶太人將如何加以擇選，許其移往巴勒斯坦？（三）如何可以取得運送船隻？（四）由誰供給運送船隻？（五）移民經費如何辦法？（六）如何接濟新移民臨時住屋之物資？</p>
<p>英國上述六項問題，將先交總統所新任命之內閣委員會加以硏究，同時該委員會亦將討論巴勒斯坦之經濟與文化發展，灌漑事宜，雇用移民服務，及處置歐洲其他流民至巴勒斯坦等問題。貝爾納斯赴巴黎期內，將由葛拉第代表貝氏出席該委會討論工作。</p>

<h3>原子彈發明者之言　成立世界政府　可免全球毀滅　原子彈應由國際團體控制</h3>
<p>〔聯合社洛杉磯十二日電〕芝加哥大學齊賴德博士，係發明原子彈工作人員之一，今日在南加州原子消息委員會中聲稱：當今原子已有新發現，更有生物學戰爭之可能性，欲免全球毀滅，唯有成立世界政府。如果飛機，大砲，戰車長此為戰爭主要武器，則美國因有龐大生產能力，仍可居堅强地位，然原子彈旣已存在，局勢遂完全改觀。美國製造原子彈，或許又較他國為多，但一俟吾人已有足數原子彈，可摧毀敵國全部城市，則多造亦於吾人殊少利益。所成問題者，厥為何人有更多之城市易遭摧毀？美國人民有六千萬居住大都市區，如果欲使美國不易遭受攻擊，則彼等必須遷居他處，此舉可在十年內耗二百萬萬美元完成之。許多人認為聯合國機構或許有防杜戰爭之良機，但無人以為該機構已使戰爭不能發生，唯有世界政府，乃一明顯之答覆。世人若圖組織世界政府，必須以全體人類之幸福為念，並應於今後二三年內，組織各種國際性團體，第一個應當控制原子能，餘者分別恢復生活標準，協助經濟問題，處理貨幣情勢及重行分配稀少之物資。</p>

<h3>美海軍定期試驗　利用V2火箭彈　探測高空離子層　將凌空直上百英里之遙</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十一日電〕美海軍六月廿七日將在新墨西哥白沙試騐塲發射上裝有科學儀器之V—2火箭彈，屆時火箭彈將凌空直上百英里，進入尚無一人能一探究竟之高空離子層。此次之試騐，將取獲陸軍械工程師之合作，後者將專司發射及操縱火箭彈事宜。海軍硏究及發明組主任波思海軍少將，於宣佈計劃中之試騐時稱：「六月廿七日之試騐，將僅屬探取高空科學智識遠大硏究計劃之第一步，此項智識，或司令人類眼界為之一新。依照海軍硏究及發明局計劃至少將利用V—2火箭彈，儘可能突入上層高空二次。科學家希望自此次V—2之試騐，可使彼等對於宇宙之若干最困難問題獲得解答，彼等將藉觀察宇宙綫方法，探悉有關原子及其構成微細質點，陰電子，陽電子，及中性子之更多事實。彼等測騐高空之大氣，對天文學家亦有裨益，蓋後者於觀察星球時，須視穿此一障礙也。科學家亦將獲得更多有關地球高空號稱離子層之電子雲層新智識，此種電子雲層與短波無綫電通訊，具有最密切之關係。地球大部能力係取給於太陽，是以天文學家及物理學家孜孜硏究太陽輻射綫已有多年，今彼等首次可觀察為大氣隔絕之放射綫，僉信此種放射綫若能滲透而達地面，則全球之生物將被其毀滅無遺。」</p>

<h3>似乎一篇大道理　潘三省表功　據供曾協助抗戰救過蒙難同志　說到和周逆關係面呈喜色</h3>
<p>（本報訊）昨日上午十時高院開庭審訊潘三省，漢奸嫌疑案，潘在戰前原為德商雅利洋行駐京代表，抗戰革興，潘即與巨尋到陳公博，周佛海，丁默邨及敵憲籌野，日本浪人佐佐木，工部局日營中村，海本，山口等互相勾結，組織上海輪船公司，自任經理，並加入敵營之上海內河輪船公司，充任監察，複組織金業聯易公會，擾亂金融，另組棉易公會，專事投機。嗣復創辦貿易銀行，推行偽方中儲劵暗盤，又常聚衆出入亞洲總會等大賭窟，組織「三省足球隊」，參加偽上海市體育會所辦之球類獻機比賽，捐輸達三百餘萬偽幣。經高檢處偵查屬實，依據懲治漢奸條例及刑法賭博罪提起公訴。</p>
<p>昨晨開審時，潘衣灰長衫，著黑布鞋，頭髮整潔，光可鑑人，臉色紅潤，精神煥發，不像一囚徒。首由曹推事詢問被吿年齡籍貫一過，即問潘之財產，據供：現有不動產僅巨潑來斯路二〇一號住宅及勞合路牛莊路口之地產，所有股票動產，均已呈繳軍統局。並謂組織上海輪船公司之動機，乃由滬錫慈善會主辦，為搶救無錫難民而設。「聯易銀行」是交易所辦的，資本二百萬元，每股偽幣二萬元。組織足球隊，是為了掩護地下工作同志的往來活動。至於球賽獻機事，潘在高檢處偵查時曾稱：彼曾作阻止「獻機運動」之行為，當時還承劉仰山從南京打長途電話警吿他，說敵憲已注意其行動，勸其當心云云。故曾請求傅劉作證。昨晨曹推事提訊劉仰山，劉矢口否認，謂並無此事。潘三省當即說道：「你別胆小呀，說說又不要緊的！」原來高檢處對劉的起訴書中，並無偽獻機運動委會委員，恐怕為了連累，加重了他的罪名。周英才律師當以「新中國手冊」為證，揭穿了他的私隱，但劉仍不承認。曹推事又問潘與周佛海有何關係，潘稱是乾親，言次面現微笑。嗣由被吿律師周英才，李謨，唐瑛諸人提出物證六件，最後潘猶聲述二點：（一）曾協助本國抗戰，與中央執行委員會調查統計局專員稽希宗聯絡，供給情報，排斥地下工作人員，營救蒙難同志，且曾為敵憲監禁，於民國卅三年入中統局，任設計委員。（二）曾協助盟國作戰，與馬丁少校，美國大使館好華君聯絡，調查敵入動向，供給有利情報，於盟機製滬時探悉敵軍防空火力，其高射砲能達八千尺高空者僅二三尊，且知其佈防位置及機塲起飛降落情形，轉吿馬丁，通知美方空軍，得以低飛作戰，增加命中率，避免本國人民之死亡不少云云。證人馬丁與稽希宗均到庭，因時間不及，未曾傳訊，即諭改期再訊。</p>

<h3>高歌「迎戰士」　復員靑年軍第三批抵滬　上海隊九十五人同來　福建隊一部返鄕</h3>
<p>卅三年初本市靑年一百五十餘人，受感於「十萬靑年十萬軍」之號召，在市黨部靑年團領導下，不辭艱險，越敵寇封鎖綫，輾轉至皖南屯溪集中，參加智識靑年從軍，旋編入靑年軍二〇八師入營受訓，其總人數經攷查合格者有一三四人，編為一中隊，復員後，除有一小部份仍留營工作外，上海中隊全體志願靑年軍九十五人昨與第三批蒞滬之復員靑年軍混合總隊自杭乘專車於下午一時半抵達上海北站，至北站歡迎者黨部主委吳紹濧，有各機關學校團體三千餘人，由市府樂隊及光夏中學童子軍樂隊到站奏樂歡迎，一時半車抵北站，上海中隊乘於列車之第七節，車外書「謹向本市各界父老問候，上海市從軍靑年」十七大字於軍樂爆竹齊鳴聲中，上海中隊健兒中隊長熊澤光率領首先下車集合，吳主委，王曉籟等乃即上前向為上海爭榮之滬市從軍靑年致慰問，並由三民主義靑年團上海支團部派戴開柱，魯文美，朱蘭墀三小姐代表向上海中隊靑年軍獻花，由秦庭耀君代表接受，旋取整隊出站，列隊相迎之各校學生即高歌「迎戰士」曲以示歡迎，於上海軍隊出發後，混合總隊再行整隊下車，計昨日到滬者共有一千八百餘人，內有二〇九師福建總隊，廈門大隊一大隊，溫州獨立中隊一中隊，二〇八師之廣東中隊一隊，南洋華僑中隊一隊及上海中隊一隊，由　憲章中校營長率領，下車後即由學生總會派汪家鑄，嚴雲紅，潘治安三小姐代表向混合總隊全體靑年軍獻花，由胡寳全，陳右西二君代表接受後，即列隊赴光復路福元倉庫及　子灣中　公司兩招待所休息，上海中隊復員靑年軍則由靑年團招待至海格路靑年館下榻。</p>
<p>登舟啟程</p>
<p>又：十日抵滬之福建大隊，已於昨日在外灘十三號碼頭登「明興」「舟山」兩輪返閩，「明興」號定於今晨啓碇離滬，「舟山」號則定於十四號晨啓碇，昨日抵滬之廈門大隊，聞亦將附乘「舟山」號返閩。又十一日抵滬之廣東總隊原定於今日下午乘自由輪離滬，因時間不及，或將延遲一天，與昨日抵滬之廣東中隊及華僑隊同行。</p>

<h3>閘北南市蓋建房屋　市府取締佔用私地</h3>
<p>（本報訊）市府當局鑒於房荒嚴重，對南市閘北一帶住民蓋建房屋，儘予營造便利，但有若干市民非法佔用私地，且未向市工務局營造處申請執照者，則該局將會同營造警察局嚴予取締。如地主發現此類情事，亦可向該處申訴要求。佔地者拆除房屋。另一方面則由工務局請求地政局徵用市民空地，俾供建屋，又對於搭建之草屋，有礙安全，亦在取締之例。</p>
<h3>目前最大困難　還是經濟問題</h3>
<p>褚慧僧（輔成）先生給我最深的印象是嚴肅，正直，一絲不茍，決不隨便說一句多餘的話，或者用一個意義浮泛的字—我從來沒有見過說話時這樣注意「精確」的人。</p>
<p>他端然坐着，頷下的長髯已漸漸花白了，坐位的後面，正是一瓶極　麗的鮮花。房間裏一片寂靜，祇聽見褚先生緩慢而淸朗的語聲。他今年已經是七十四歲高齡的人，然而抗戰八年之中，在後方還是盡瘁國事，奔波為勞！他說，「八年以來，身體倒還好，但是從去年起，似乎差一點了。」</p>
<p>對於政局，他說，無所謂悲觀或者樂觀，目前最大的困難還是經濟問題，外國貨源源進口，本國工業亳無出路，情形實在危險。</p>
<p>勝利之後，兩種人加深了上海奢靡的風氣。第一批回到上海的人，有不少是在內地發了國難財的人，他們帶了錢到上海來，還是囤積居奇，擾亂市塲，這是第一種使上海風氣更壞的人。第二種人是一部份不肖的接收人員。褚老先生憤憤地說，「他們那裏是接受，簡直就是搶東西！」</p>
<p>他吿訴我，最近，參政會，監察院，中央監察委員會，已經合組了淸查團，專門調查接收工作，如果查有舞弊實據，即交法院嚴辦，希望老百姓能够協助檢舉。</p>
<p>他慨然地說，「上海本來是五方雜處的地方，再加上這兩種人來推波揚瀾，以致弄得這般田地。時至今日，已經不是一二人以身作則所能挽回頹風了！」</p>
<p>我懷着沉重的心情走向雨中，擠上了塞滿男男女女的電車。上海還是那麼喧鬧，然而我似乎是剛聽到了遠處的晨鐘暮鼔，在人叢人，我忽然覺得寂寞了。</p>
<p>褚輔成痛恨勝利以後的兩種人</p>

<h3>控吿選舉違法案　辯論終結候宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕夏功楷律師等五人，為要求確認本市參議員選舉無效，控吿上海市政府及所屬各區公所案，昨晨在地院民庭再度開審。原吿延願鰲，方中，陸輼海三律師出庭，被吿方面除第一被吿（市政府）之辯護人章士劍·秦聯奎等諸律師外，第二被吿（各區公所）更延江一平，姜屛藩，王善祥，左德熹，鳳昔醉，黃濟等律師出庭辯護。原吿僅夏功楷一人到庭，對其所控舞弊一點，表示撤回，惟繼續主張違法一點。被吿方面由法定代理人之代表人張曉崧，李學訓出庭。對原吿所控違法一點，提出反證，至此開始辯論，辯論達一小時，被吿方面律師稱，原吿之控訴，並無法律根據，而證據之遞呈，在起訴之後，可見原吿為控訴而找事實，非先有事實而後控訴；且原吿旣知被吿之選舉手續為違法，何不於前三日糾正之，而於落選之後始行起訴。直至十一時四十餘分，庭諭辯論終結，定本月十七日下午二時宣判。</p>

<h3>胡西園談電器業　瞻望前途不容樂觀　工資高·成本重　不堪外貨一擊　美國電扇到港售價低廉</h3>
<p>（本報訊）當此外貨源源進口，我民族工業瀕於破產聲中，記者昨訪亞浦耳電器廠總經理胡西園，叩詢電器業近况。承談該業目前差堪維持，但前途不容樂觀。戰前外商在滬所設之奇異安迪生燈泡廠因機器在上海淪陷期間已為日人搬走，故至今未能恢復生產。又因國內政局不安定，一般外商皆　敢貿然投資，因之目前國貨電器，尚未遭遇大敵。燈光美國雖有出品，且售價祇美金一角，合之國蹩僅二百餘元，但因運輸尚未暢通，貨物又非鉅値，故不屑大量來華。否則以與成本卽須四百元之國貨燈泡相較，又焉能不為之壓倒。但美國電扇已到香港，每具令人港幣八十元，合之國幣為三萬二千元。但目前上海國貨電扇之每具售價為十四萬元，如此相較前途殊堪憂慮，故現今國貨電器，根本未能向外傾銷，祇能向內地謀發展。</p>
<p>言及工人工資問題，胡氏稱：戰前國貨之所以能呈蓬勃氣象大量向外輸出，係因我國工資較低，成本輕，售價較外貨低廉之緣故，但目前我國工人之工資，以幣制計，已轉為世界各國之最高者，現下工人之工資標準頗多不合理之處，旣已照生活指數計算，但底薪却較戰前增高多多，如此每使一般工廠不能負担。</p>
<p>關於即將召開之生產會議，胡氏之意見為欲挽救目前工業危機，除保護關稅等法則外，最主要者猶在政府與人民合作，勞方與資方合作，否則必將同歸於盡。</p>

<h3>與本市一別八載　陳光甫海外歸來　談美國戰後物資亦不充裕　希望吾今後經濟建設進步</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海商業儲蓄銀行董事長陳光甫氏，與本市一別八載，昨忽自美乘「麥克茂萊勝利」號輪，翩然蒞滬。行裝甫卸，記者卽趨其寓邸訪問，當承接見。陳氏態度謙遜，兩鬢微白，雖自稱為抱病之軀，惟精神殊佳，渠於去年十月間，奉派代表我國全國商業聯合會，出國赴美，參加國際商業會議。該會休會後，渠大部份之時間，係在波士頓養病故與各界頗少接觸。記者當詢以美國最近經濟態度。據談：目前美國經濟情形，方自戰時狀態步入於和平階段。在此調整之過程中，工潮遂迭有發生。例如最近全國海員，亦正醞釀工潮，有於六月十五日爆發之說。惟當局表示，有把握在期前便之解決。又戰後美國物資、亦不充裕。故我國向美大批購貨，美仍須考慮本身之供需問題，然後頒發出口許可證。此中尤以機器一項，供應更少。記者復詢以對我國經濟之期望。渠稱：抗戰多年，我國始獲得勝利，亟望我國今後之經濟建設，能入於進步之途徑云。陳氏現年六十六萬，江蘇鎭江人，早年畢業於美國本薛爾文尼亞大學，返國後曾服務於江蘇銀行。民國四年六月二日，復興莊得之等，手創上海銀行，陳氏自任該行經理。初設時在寗波路永大銀行現址。僅有二開間之店面一間，資本亦僅十萬元。其後經陳氏精心籌劃，該行資本逐年遞增。民國八年增資至一百萬元，民國十年七月更增資至二百五十萬元，現在資本額已達二千萬元。該行過去素以提倡小額儲蓄存款聞名。民國二十年間，金融界發生擠兌銀洋風潮，該行無限制予各存戶提取銀洋存款之便利，信譽遂更蒸蒸日上。民國廿年六月間，該行寗波路之新廈亦吿落成，業務一日千里。目前存款總額，已逾二百億元。全國分支行處，多至四十一單位，員生達一千五百人。平時用人唯才，厲行科學管理。行紀之佳，業務之健全，稱譽全國。該行附帶事業，有中國旅行社，服務旅客，開發旅行支票，尤稱便利。此外尚有第一信用及大華兩保險公司。凡此種，皆陳氏耗費半生精力所努力樹創。陳氏平日除致力於金融事務外，性好閱讀硏求，暇時常瀏覽中外書籍。八一三滬戰爆發後，陳氏即　赴後方，襄佐中樞，策劃各項金融措施。並迭次代表我國，遠涉重洋，完成各項重要經濟使命，厥功殊偉。</p>

<h3>比賽有意外之緊張　星東力戰克猶太　黑馬倔強難馴五比三勝來費力　星東恢復陣容下半時壓倒勁敵</h3>
<p>星東遠征足球隊，昨日下午五時半，在逸園球塲迎戰素稱黑馬之猶太隊，賽前球迷皆預料為一面倒，星東必勝，熟料黑馬倔強難馴，星東幾乎翻倒，昨賽上半塲，二對二秋色平分，迨下半塲，幸聯軍馮景祥黎兆榮入塲，方得以五對三造成勝利，然亦費盡力氣矣。昨日觀眾擁擠，約計一萬餘人，裁判蔣吟僧。兩軍陣容列後：</p>
<p>星東</p>
<p>朱兆恒</p>
<p>霍耀華　侯榕生</p>
<p>羅偉權　許竟成　郭英祺下　馮坤勝上</p>
<p>李碩友　劉松生上　黎兆榮下　郭英祺上　張金海　馮景祥下　鄧廣森</p>
<p>猶太</p>
<p>昨賽分析</p>
<p>昨日猶太對星東聯隊，比賽竟有出人意外之緊張，初以為將成一面倒，實則不然，星東原擬休息之馮景祥黎兆榮，至下半時遂不得不登塲參戰，鎮壓猶太，星東乃回復其原來最佳之陣容，然下半時亦僅以三比一得勝，其中一球為十二碼，爭鬥之劇烈可見。猶太球門太差，有者失之於莫明其妙，否則比數恐更近，猶太個人技術並不差，前鋒合作究不如星東之純熟美妙，客軍之勝亦在此。昨日之賽，更有若干幸運之成份在內，雙方皆有必中之球，射中門木彈回，差一些未得入內。下半時開始後五分鍾內竟互中三球，得也失也，莫明其妙，最後十分鍾猶太之攻勢，甚為猛烈，，幸無差失。總之，猶太踢來甚好，星東則未臻理想，致成此局面。</p>
<p>猶佬獻花</p>
<p>五時卅分，鳴笛開賽，猶太隊管理迪佛里斯先行獻花客軍，繼即接觸星東順風先攻，相持不下，至七分鍾時，李碩友鄧廣森兩翼包抄，球如穿梭，劉松生獲得機會，離門廿五碼猛射，球從右角入網，一比〇星東先開紀錄。猶太羣起反攻，無奈霍侯兩後衛壁壘嚴整，無隙可乘，至十一分鍾時，奧列維拉上塲，麥律希改任右內鋒，史丹侖暫吿下野，陣容調整，頓見起色，萊遼帶球疾進，馮坤勝手吻犯規於禁區，法凡笑主罰，竟未得中，一刻鍾時，松生得碩友小傳，敵前叩門，中溫諾干懷，未見成功。二十二分鍾，劉郭雙騎並進，里司堡玩忽職守，松生乘機　入，五六碼處，一蹴入網，二比〇星東再拔一城，猶太豈肯甘心，奧列維拉單刀疾進，法凡笑接觸，派司柯普司汀，一叩未中，再叩而入，二比一，猶太扳回一球，士氣頓盛。二十七分鍾時，五鋒並進，許竟成回救不及，侯霍力阻，險象叢生，不三分鍾，麥律希又來唐突，朱兆恒拍成角球，史丹恩再度入塲替出卻力司基，主開角球，恰到好處，法凡笑牛腿猛射，侯將軍救驚，頭上之功，上半塲行將終了，馮坤勝又犯法闖禍，十二碼判決，曼亞執行，完成使命，二比二秋色平分，結束上半塲。</p>
<p>急調援軍</p>
<p>檸檬過後，星東見勢不佳，急以大將黎兆榮馮景祥調入，劉松生馮坤勝退休，郭英祺復左前衛原職，張金海移中，猶太亦以雪盤司汀補卻力司基。開賽後，星東先發制人，首取攻勢，三分鍾時，馮景祥力射，張金海　上　渡，球吿入網，三比二，星東再度領前。未三分鍾，　納斯單槍匹馬，直入星東腹地，離門三十碼處　射，兆恒得而復失，猶太又扳成三比三和局，八分鍾時，李碩友左路與兵，立刻回敬，四比三星東三度領前，時猶太五鋒奔騰活躍，客軍幾忙招架，許竟成遂退守內衛，協助防禦。混戰至終塲前一分鍾，曼亞犯規，馮景祥主罰十二碼，深中紅心，五比三，星東勝利奠定，而時間亦隨之終了。</p>
<h3>港軍最後一仗　下週三戰華聯</h3>
<p>遠征軍星東足球隊，三戰俱捷，聲壯勢盛，原定尚有比賽二塲，卽明日（星期五）對東華，及十六日（星期日）對靑百，昨日足球委員會假來喜飯店舉行會議，決定增加比賽一塲，由華聯與之對抗，定下星期三（十九日）仍在逸園交鋒。</p>
<h3>排球委員會　今日三次會議</h3>
<p>本市體育協會排球委員會主辦之首屆上海排球聯賽，自六月一日開始報名以來，原定十日截止。茲因市體育館舖建地板，須於本月底內方可完畢，該賽勢必於七月初方可開賽，故報名期展至廿日截止，凡本市男女排球隊，均可往陝西南路三〇三號體育館內該會辦事處辦理手續。又委員會定今日下午五時在市體育館會議室召開第三次會議，商討聯賽事宜，希下列委員準時出席：張葆奎（主席）劉荷生·龔師尹·謝益欽·俞云九·瞿兆鴻·張碧如·王守方。</p>
<h3>小學科程研究座　為什麽要恢復「美術科」</h3>
<p>教育部為適應建國需要，在簡化課程，缺乏師資的幾個前提之下，研討如何修正小學課程標準，「美術科」在筆者堅決的主張之下恢複了，會議旣竟，蒙教界同仁不棄，紛紛垂詢恢復「美術科」的理由，今作答複如下：</p>
<p>（一）美術教育的最高理想</p>
<p>小學生為什麽要學美術？理由非常簡單，是要利用美術來改變其行為，決不是造就他們成功一個作家。</p>
<p>如何可以達到這個目標，第一步是使兒童作美的享樂，用兩種方法同時進行，即（一）美術的欣賞，（三）美術的創作。從這樣的實施中，再使兒童的日常生活上應用這些美的原則和美的方法，以完成生活美化。因之，行為方面便得到了改變。這種說法，李希脫華克（Richtwark）曾經有過同樣的主張，「五四」時代蔡孑民先生創導的「美育代宗教」，主張也是相同的。</p>
<p>卅一年修正課程標準中的「圖畫科」，是作為「知識技能方面訓練」的一種，現在恢復的「美術科」，則應該納入於「道德行」</p>
<p>（二）兒童美術創作的問題</p>
<p>主張美的享樂，並不完全否定美的創作。不過如何發展其能力，確是一個重要問題。</p>
<p>維也納兒童藝術班主持者　石克（F．Cizek）教授所實施的教學方法。可以說是完全合於兒童，美術創作的理想的，他佈置一個豐富的學習環境，運用誘掖暗示等的方法，巧妙地發展兒童創作能力。並不像我們卅一年圖畫課程標準中間，利用什麽「基本練習」，「臨畫」等阻礙兒童自由發表，自由創作的方法，確實可以參攷。（註二）</p>
<p>因之，「美術科」在發表的作業中，要絕對廢止「基本練習」，「臨畫」等的教學了。</p>
<p>（三）恢復「美術科」以後</p>
<p>有人也許要担憂，修訂課程是要「簡化」，現在單純的「圖畫」，比了豐富的「美術」，似乎是會成功問題的。</p>
<p>可是實事並不如此，一味苛求兒童描畫正確的「圖畫」，比了以享樂為前提，尤其是以絕對自由的創作為發表作業的「美術」，從常識的判斷上要合於兒童的需要。從興趣原則上講，單純的「圖畫」，要比豐富的「美術」為乏味。「兒童作畫，不是根據為方面的訓練」之下了。（註一）</p>
<p>他的抽象知識，而是根據他在自然態度之下所直接看見的。畫家作畫才上根據他用特殊的看法所看見的；畫家的看法，倒是需要學問知識和訓練，方才可能。」（註三）這是純以研究兒童繪畫心理之後的正確結論。所以是並不違反簡化課程的前提的。</p>
<p>至於為了師資缺乏，所以用「臨畫」等的方法，可是，平心靜氣想一想，會描畫的師資恐怕也不多，是否因之可以取消「圖畫科」，等訓練好了師資再設科，那是笑話。那麽，我認為：師資缺乏固然是一大問題，但需要的物質條件一天不解決，有了師資也是成功問題的。（溫肇桐，三十五，六，十二。）</p>

<p>〔法新聞社巴黎十一日電〕台維斯盃網球歐洲帶半決賽，法國對南斯拉夫，兩隊實力不相上下，第一日比賽結果，法國勝單打兩組，先聲奪人，滿以為再勝一組，即可將南國淘汰，但昨日雙打賽，法國隊調動人馬不當，致被南國隊獲勝，成二對一。本日復有單打賽兩組，法國若能勝其一組，仍可獲勝，不幸兩組盡朱。按第一日單打，法國選手貝脫拉與貝納特對南國選手米蒂克與邦斯克，每組均劇戰五盤之久，南國選手卒以塲地生疏而吿失敗。第二日雙打組比賽，法國隊隊長為使兩人休息起見，更換貝里柴與台斯脫拉摩上塲，南國隊仍以邦斯克與米蒂克應戰，兩人塲地旣熟，得獲勝局。本日舉行單打兩組，第一組南國米蒂克勝貝納特，法國一般觀眾尚不悲觀，認為最後一組猶有獲勝之望。迨第二組南國邦斯克與法國貝脫拉上塲，全塲空氣乃覺緊張，蓋勝負關鍵在此一戰，貝脫拉以法國全國單打冠軍之雄風，必能將對方壓倒。開賽之初，邦斯克較為鎮靜，首勝一盤，但貝脫拉立即報以顏色，賽至第四盤時，雙方難分難解，貝脫拉以九—七勝此一盤，至第五盤時，貝脫拉腿部痙攣，行動不便，不幸挫敗，比數為六比三，三比六，六比四，七比九，六比〇。三日比賽結果三對二，南斯拉夫淘汰法國，進入決賽，將與瑞典與比利時兩隊中之獲勝者對壘。</p>

<h3>治黃商榷（二）</h3>
<p>— 褚同安</p>
<p>（二）築閘地點的研究　黃河下游，除了洛沁二小支流外，沒有其他支流；河身北入於沾，南入於淮，黃河只是一道通海的河槽，把它的中上流的水，送入海中而已。黃河的水量，自龍門以上，東受汾，西受渭，渭水更受了涇和北洛二水，該四水的流域，面積約當黃河流域之半，而該四水的水位，也是漲落無定的。所以假使建閘於龍門以上，必不能收調節整個黃河水量之功。故築閘的地方，應該在潼關以下。潼關以下的黃河，南阻於崤山脈，北阻於中條山脈，直至過了析城山與邙山，始入平原，其中有三百里的山巔地，便是建閘的理想地帶。在此地帶，倘若加以精密的調查，必定可能發現一處是宜於建閘的。退一步說，假使在這理想地帶，竟不可能發現一處適宜於建閘的地點，足以調節整個黃河的水量，那末，只須建一較小之閘，用以調整汾，渭，涇，北洛，四水的水量，而另於龍門以上七百里的山地間，在覓適當之處，建一水閘，以調整黃河上游的水量。如此的分段調整，也可能使黃河的水量，保持經常狀態的。</p>
<p>（三）水閘的調節水量法與新氣象學的利用　水閘完成後，水位閘就可給高一二百尺，因而可以形成一狹長形的湖；這個「人工湖」，便是用以調節水量的。隨同水閘的完成，應同時在晋，陝，甘，綏，寗，等省，選定適當地點，分別設立新式氣象台。用最新的「高氣團分析法」，可以在半年或數月前，預測氣象的變化，因而可以推斷什麽時候，某區地域或將有大雨，隨時報告給水閘。水閘便可根據這寫報告，先期放去蓄在「人工湖」中的水，待大雨來時，河水激漲，水閘一方面宣洩出適量的水，使不使危及下游；一方面便將多餘的水，儲於「人工湖」內；那末下游自無大水猝至，堤防潰決之虞了。</p>
<p>（四）使用挖泥船以掃去河心之沙，使保持一定深度；　並以挖出之泥，加厚河堤　黃河的水中含有沙泥成份很多，據張其昀氏的估計，約佔百分之十一，漢書上曾說：「涇水一石，有泥六斗。」事實上涇水有時確完全是些泥漿，黃河雖沒有到涇水般的地步，但百分之十一的泥沙成份，也相當的多了。經過二千里緩慢的流，河床又怎會不被泥沙沉積而日高呢？針對的治法，莫如掃沙。過去淸代有一個時期，治理黃河，也用船掃沙，可惜用的是老法，所以沒甚著效。現在世界上，　巴拿馬運河，便是用新式挖泥船，不時加以疏濬的。七七事變前，上海江海關的濬浦局，有八隻挖泥船，經常担任着疏濬工作；其中的一隻，是世界最大的。疏濬的結果，在很短期間內，使長江的神灘不致於阻礙航行，功效卓著。所以筆者以為對付黃河河身之高，可用挖泥船按段加以挖深；所費旣省，辦理又易。挖出之泥，即以加厚兩岸堤防，那末，河堤亦不致失修了，豈非一舉兩得！</p>
<p>綜上所述，建閘之後，可使黃河下游無洪流猝至的危險；挖深河床，可使河身日低，堤防加固；造成河患的主因和赴因，都可消除，黃河自不致再有水患了。</p>
<p>（丙）前述整治計劃在經濟上的檢討</p>
<p>（一）建閘的費用　我們知道長江大水閘的建造費在十三億至七億美元之間，黃河的水量遠較長江為小，且長江水閘尚須許多航行上的設備。黃河因流量較少，船隻的噸位亦小，主要的目的，只在調節水量，對於航行設備，便可簡化，故其建造費用，自必較長江水閘為廉。雖因此而產生之電力亦小，然以所發電力之收入，以收回其建閘之成本，似屬可能的。</p>
<p>（二）「人工湖」的補償與華北農業的改觀　因水閘而造成的「人工湖」，面積必然是相當大的，否則便不能任調節水量的使命；因此必有若干田地，廢入湖中。然因湖面造成後，湖水的兩側山地，本來無法獲得灌溉之利的，現在便可以利用電力來吸取「人工湖」中的水，去灌溉那些荒蕪濯濯的童山，使成為林塲農　，以抵補造湖的損失。並且更進一步，可廣泛的利用水閘所發的電，使整個黃土大平原的農業，來個劃時期的躍進，配合了現代科學技術，一旦有種子，種植方法，肥料，和害蟲防治等等，都能加以改良後，那末，這塊廣大平原上的農產物，必將有驚人的增加，區區因人工造湖而招致的損失，是無足掛齒的。</p>
<p>（三）航運上的改進　上面說過黃河經常水深不及　丈，闊不過數十丈，為了淺，所以黃河下游，雖自榮澤以下可通民船，但因河身太淺，舟行甚感困難；在四五月　河水　　時，榮澤以東一帶若干淺處，舟子們不得不裸體下河推船使行。　　航行困難的大河流，實為舉世所僅見。現在假使用挖泥船逐段加以　深，而以水閘調節並控制適當的水量，那末，航運必將大為便利，不但民船，也許數十噸的小汽船，也可能通行無阻的。</p>
<p>（四）工礦的發展及其他經濟上的利益　黃河流域所經各省　　蘊藏極當，山西省的煤織更有名於世界。我們知道當蘇聯聶伯河水閘完成後，許多薪興工業便應運而生，不旋　間便造成了一個人口三十萬的都市。以彼例此，隨着黃河水閘的興建，華北的工礦業無疑的也將大大的發展，而水閘所在地，必將成為交通和工業的中心；一個嶄新都市的興起，是絕對意料中事。更因整個華北工農業的發展，生產激增，人民財富加多，商業亦必日趨繁盛，那末北方的繁榮，不都有賴於黃河嗎？（未完）</p>

<h3>獄中散記</h3>
<p>— 姚隼</p>
<p>我在監獄里每天所接觸到的約莫二十多位難友，我曾經探詢過他們的案情，研究過他們的犯罪事實，據我觀察的結果，他們之間有許多是受了冤枉的，較少數的則是糊里糊塗地犯了法，在這二十多個例子里，我還沒有找到一個是明知故犯的。差不多是同樣地，當每一個人結束了他向我的敘述時，都很感慨地說：「我就是因為說話太老實，才吃了這個虧！……」</p>
<p>譬如，那個小商人王興順，他的一個堂兄弟因爭購田產而殺死了人，那兇手當然逃走了，而他卻被吿到法院來。法官問他：「某某被人殺死，你知道嗎？」「報告法官，當然知道的。……」「殺死的時候，你在塲嗎？」「不在塲……」「屍首你看見嗎？」「後來是看見的……」「死者跟你家里有仇隙嗎？」「就是跟我的堂兄爭買一段田……」「那就是跟你家有仇了。」……於是，他被定了一個「共同殺人」的罪名，判處十年有期徒刑。</p>
<p>還有，那位姓管的鄉長，有一天他派着鄉丁送兩個逃兵到縣政府，在路上因為逃兵們要奪槍逃跑，被一個鄉丁開槍打死了，後來那個鄉丁判處十年有期徒刑，而他則被控以「教唆殺人」罪，判處無期徒刑，成立他犯罪的主要理由是：有人供稱他曾經對那鄉丁說了「如果路上要逃，可以打死」的話，而那鄉丁卻已病死獄中，無可對證……。</p>
<p>至於那個姓吳的佃農，卻是由原吿變成了被告的。因為他欠了地主的一些租谷，被抓去吊起來毆打，他心裏不甘，道便到法院來控訴，還邀了幾個證人，但在庭審時，法官問他是用什麽繩子綁的，他說是用棕繩，證人說是用蔴繩，他說有一丈多長，證人說是七八尺，於是，他被反坐了個「誣告」罪名，處以六個月的徒刑，連三個證人也判了偽證，同樣地也是六個月徒刑。</p>
<p>像這一類的例子，我所耳聞目見的，算是太多了。所以這裏流行着一句話：「一字人公堂，九牛拉不出！」這是許許多多的人用他們的冤枉作為代價，而換得來的一句經騐之談。</p>
<p>據說，有許多千真萬確的案子，只要你矢口否認，法官也無法定你的罪；而有許多冤枉的案子，只因你一時失言，便被羅織入罪。所以，那些吸人膏流人血的，倒常常可以逍遙法外；而那些連殺雞都不敢的，反倒成功了「殺人犯」，而坐在牢裏。……</p>
<p>對於法律，我是個門外漢，不想妄加批評，也沒有興趣在這裏發什麽偉論。當然，我們的司法制度自有其完整的一套。（未完）</p>
<h3>大衣</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>今天早晨，一向睡得很遲的父親，忽然起了一個大早，粥也不吃，就匆匆跨出大門，我問他到那裏去，他答：「專員公署。」我嚇了一跳，問他：「什麽事呀？」他笑着說：「摸彩去！」</p>
<p>後來問了母親，才知道，原來最近本縣收到一批救濟署裏發來的舊衣，議決用抽籤方法分給全縣的公教人員，昨夜來通知，每人須於今晨前往專員公署抽籤領取，據說額角亮的，能抽着大衣西裝，額角暗的，僅得些破襪子破帽子月經帶之類。「我們是一向倒霉的，看來不過是破襪子月經帶的份兒，這麽一個老早趕出去，真犯不着！」母親說。</p>
<p>「那倒不一定，說不定今天父親紅運高照，會抽着一件頂刮刮的皮大衣，給你老人家新年裏出出風頭！」我笑着說。</p>
<p>「做夢！」母親對我披了披嘴。</p>
<p>等着等着，等到九點一刻，父親氣吁吁地回來了。不是做夢，捏在他手裏的，竟然是一件大衣，雖夠不上「頂刮刮」，但母親的破箱子裏能光臨如此一位「貴賓」，真可說一聲「三生有幸！」於是合家歡騰，尤其母親，一雙放大的半小腳，幾乎飛了起來。</p>
<p>父親得意地說，當他抽到這件大衣時，連專員公署的秘書先生都眼紅，連連向他道着「恭喜」。他又說，這件大衣，式子雖不十分摩登，但倒是的的刮刮的舶來品，不相信，呌我們把鼻子湊上去聞聞看：「不是有一股牛奶和白脫油的味道嗎？外國人是吃牛奶和白脫油的，所以衣服上有這種味道。」</p>
<p>一聽這話，母親連忙將鼻子湊到大衣上，一面眯花眼笑地咕着：「這料子還牢得很呢！至少還可以穿五年；哦，穿了五年呌紅幫裁縫去翻個身，還可以穿五年　，唷！裏面還有襯絨哩！將來面子夾裏破了，把這襯絨拆出來，還可以做襯衫，做褲子，做棉鞋夾裏，……」</p>
<p>太平洋彼岸的吃牛奶白脫油的太太或小姐呀！假使你見到這個中國婦人，伏在你的舊大衣上盤算着「十年計劃」，你將希奇好笑呢？還是要流淚痛哭？</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（三）（五）</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>「逼急了你怎麽樣？」老闆娘也不甘示弱地說。</p>
<p>「逼急了老子，老子就要揍你個婆娘！」廖老闆說着便勒勒袖子，作出欲打的姿勢。</p>
<p>老闆娘一慌，手急眼快，先連忙拿起那柄大得可觀的刨藥的刀，自衛地舉向廖老闆，一面氣焰兇兇地說：</p>
<p>「來吧，老娘今兒跟你拼上了！過年不宰豬，老娘就得光宰了你！」</p>
<p>老闆娘執刀趨前，活像她父親那種劊子手的神氣。廖老闆這時倒有點怕了。老闆娘手裏揮動着明亮亮的殺人兇器，不是玩兒的！稍一不慎，碰上去，就得血淋淋人頭落地。但廖老闆又不能讓老闆娘看出他是懼怯了。正為難之間，適巧廖樑在院子裏，正一把把抓了刨好的藥材，撒滿了一地玩兒。於是廖老闆靈機一動，連忙借岔跑出去抱住了廖樑，佯嗔地罵着。</p>
<p>「緊是夠倒霉的了，你個鬼兒子還來糟踏藥材！」</p>
<p>廖樑「哇」地一聲哭了出來。</p>
<p>老闆娘果然中了計，急忙放下刀，撲過去便搶抱了回來廖樑，一面罵着：</p>
<p>「你倒霉，關我的兒子什麽事？不要臉的老鬼，你倒好意思在小孩子身上發邪氣。」</p>
<p>老闆娘潑辣地和廖老闆吵了一陣，回到屋裏一把鼻涕，一把眼淚地又哭了一陣。廖老闆唯恐事體鬧大了，便改變態度，心平氣和地向老闆娘說：</p>
<p>「生意不好，手頭就寬裕不起來，並不是我故意不買豬。你想想，現在舖子裏養着五六個夥計，到了年關還要賞酒錢，上個月的工錢，也沒有發給他們，哪兒再有閑錢買豬呢」？</p>
<p>「生意旣是不好，就該想別的辦法！買一頭豬也抵不上你賠十吊錢呀！」老闆娘抹抹眼角的淚，抽噎地說着。</p>
<p>「有啥子辦法？世界變了，洋玩意詩興，中國玩意兒只有倒霉！」廖老闆說罷感慨地嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>「你開掉一個夥計就可以買一頭豬，沒有生意還何必用那麽多夥計？」</p>
<p>一句話提醒了廖老闆，他倒不是為了要實現老闆娘買豬的計劃，而採納她的建議，他覺得這倒是一個可節省開支，減輕負擔的辦法。橫豎藥材存貨還多，第一不需要再出去採辦，第二已經刨製好了的藥劑足夠銷售三五個月。因此採辦藥材的夥計可以不用了。刨製藥劑的徒弟也可以不用了，只留下一個師父就夠。這樣一來，回春堂旣省掉不小一筆花銷，家裏生活就稍微能夠舒展一下。（買豬的事自然不成問題了。）決定這個緊縮政策以後，並決定了就在年關以前實施。</p>
<p>關於回春堂緊縮的情報，由廖棟告訴了寶鈴，而且向寶鈴道喜，這緊縮預算中竟沒有把他列在裏面。這的確使寶鈴感到忭慰！他不是怕失了業沒飯吃，而是怕失了業，他就要回到家裏去。他不願回到家裏去；是為了不願作墨家的寄生虫；寗願作廖家的奴隸！</p>

<p>我國綢廠所需用之人造絲原料，在戰前來自義大利者爲多，自第二次大戰發生，義貨來源斷絕，本國又無人造絲廠設備，於是日貨人造絲遂充斥於市上，迨勝利以前之以前之一二年內，日本本土疊遭轟炸，且運輸日益困難，故人造絲來源亦更形缺乏，勝利後日本人造絲工廠一時甚難復原，義大利亦復如是，目前滬地人造絲之供給，全賴紡建公司及中信局配售之敵人物資，唯因貨源有限，花色不全，故價格方面甚難維持其平穩，且國外美國市塲人造絲之價格，官價爲一每磅美金五角，而唶市則已做至每磅美金二元，每箱二百磅已需四百元美金，義大利之產地價格與美國相仿，如加上運滬運費及關稅等，估計每箱需國幣二百五十萬元，較市上售價高出百餘萬元。據業中人云：如本國不設法生產人造絲，價格有上漲可能云。</p>

<p>出版界　特辑</p>
<h3>敬告中国出版界</h3>
<p>— 危言</p>
<p>中國的出版界顯然的相當的貧乏，現在更似乎還有點病態。中國的出版物照它們的性質分析起來，大概可以歸成三類。第一類是政治家的宣傳品，它們不一定很顯明的是直接有關政治的文章，這一類出版物也許是文藝的，社會學，哲學的，甚至於是科學的，可是它們主要的作用並非學術性的而是足供政治家達到某種政治目的的工具。這類出版物的內容往往是一種黨八股。第二類是部定敎科書，這都是一些刻板文章，它們要符合一定的標準，這裏面沒有學術自由的精神，沒有自由發揮的餘地。第二類是色情狂的刋物，它們適合于低級趣味，寫稿的人祗要稿費，出版家只要能賣錢，這裏面可以隨意捕風捉影造謠生事。</p>
<p>請讀者們公平的選擇一下看！在中國的出版界有幾本書是純粹硏究學術的？有幾本書是介紹西洋最近科學的？有幾本書是介紹現代生活所必需的日常知識的？實在少得可憐！爲甚麼？因爲沒有銷路，出版家不願意賠本。出版家不要的東西，更沒有人敢嘗試寫作了。</p>
<p>我們認爲中國出版界的生意眼太重了。因此，他們出版的東西處處在牽就讀者的趣味，而不在提高讀者的趣味。我們認爲這並不是替文化界服務，而在阻碍文化的發展。我們希望出版家以後多多出版有學術性的作品，公正討論世界大勢和國家建设的書籍，和有益於日常社會生活的刋物。政黨可以有它的宣傳工具，但一般的出版界應該從政黨中解放出來。出版界可以適合羣衆的需要，但同時應負起提高羣衆文化水準的責任。</p>
<h3>「思想与社會」</h3>
<p>— 傳统先</p>
<p>作者　張東蓀</p>
<p>出版者　商務印書館</p>
<p>日期　三十五年三月重慶版</p>
<p>頁數　二〇四頁</p>
<p>最近張先生寄來他在重慶出版的「思想與社會」一書，是他的「知識與文化」的續編，全書九章，可分爲六大部分：（一）汎諭人類思想的社會因素；（二）說明三種知識系統；（三）哲學與社會組織的關係；（四）中國的道統——需家思想與理學；（五）西洋的道統——耶教思想，社會主義，與民主主義；（六）中國文化的出路。</p>
<p>因爲這本書在上海還未發行，我想大家都希望先覩爲快。現在僅將本書內容畫出一個輪廓，作一簡短的介紹。至於本人對這書的幾點批評留待下期再發表。</p>
<p>一·人類思想組織的因素</p>
<p>人類思想的組織有三個基本的因素：（一）生物性質的知覺構型；（二）純形式的概念表格；（三）社會文化的功能抉定。再說得簡單一點就是（一）感覺經騐，（二）槪念形式，（三）社會文化。這三層是互相浸透而不是獨立無干的。人類的思想是以概念爲主體，而槪念一方面爲知覺構型所左右，另一方面又受文化決定的影響。換句話說，概念的形成是由於兩方面：一是由於知覺的基型化；一是由於表示的符合號。人類對於外界的知覺是有完形組織的，而這種知覺所遺留下來的影相並非和知覺對象一模一樣的，這種影相往往極爲糢糊而只留了一個大體輪廓，於是知覺對象的特殊性逐漸消逝。而輪廓相似的影相組織起來，成功了一種有普遍性的基型，這便是我們所謂槪念了。但是槪念不僅是知覺在主觀方面的基型化，同時它也是我們個人之間互相溝通的表示的符號化。我們由於社會共同生活的需要彼此要表達情意，於是便有了語言，語言的符號化抽象化便成了思想。</p>
<p>二·三種知識系統</p>
<p>人類的知識在根本上一方面是站在生物的立塲，另一方面離不了社會文化的背景，於是人類的幾個火的知微系統乃是建築這兩方面的。張先生特別提出了三個大的知識系統並且說明它們和社會的關係。這三個知識系統就是（1）常識系統，（2）科學系統，（3）形而上學系統。常識是由　覺的渾然一片中劃出來而造成的，這　造作純是由於對付方便，而這種方便是由於生物的利用和心理上的簡括，以及社會的習成。科學是在本然的事物上抽出事實來。形而上學乃是把理想當作實在，其目的在於造出「理想的實在」。張先生說：「在常識系統上所恃的工具是知覺的辨別，而其方法則是比附法。在科學這個系統上所恃的工具是理智的分析工夫，其方法是測度與實騐。至於形而上學則恃「透智」（Insight）。是所謂對演法。」</p>
<p>這三個知識系統乃是由於應付文化的需要所造出的三種界域。常識系統乃是由於日常生活習慣的方便；科學乃是由於人類對付自然，了解自然，和解釋自然，形而上學乃是限於文化方面的，它應包括道德，社會，和政治。形而上學的知識是爲了立信而　出來的理由。它不祗是「知」，而且要在知道以後自然而然在自己的行爲上起變化。</p>
<p>這三個知識系統雖然是建築在心理的基礎，但是它的發展却是完全屬於文化範圍的了。</p>
<p>三·哲學理論與社會組織</p>
<p>形而上學的前身是宗敎，而宗敎是人類在精神方面安慰的方法。形而上學並不是最高的知識或最眞的知識，它是限於理想的界域，它只是爲實際生活找理由而已。這個知識系統乃中是「非實騐的」，而同時必是「歷史的」。形而上學的性質是由於傳統而決定的，其問題是由傳統而遺傳下來的，其所用的槪念是自有的傳統的根據的。所以張光生認爲形而上學所用的槪念和所提出的問題都是表現那個文化的傳統的。能以英國的經騐主義爲例，這個哲學思想和英國整個的文化有　的，由於　官經騐而推演出「反　　主養」，以至於個人主義，和功利主義的傳統。</p>
<p>從另一方面講，社會組織自有其心理的基礎。社會離不了盲語，假使個人的心靈上不具備一種互相交通的共同的槪念，社會便無法成立。一個民族的文化傳統不僅包含社會制度，道德標準，並且還有思維態度和民族性格。例如中國社會有一套中國式的思想，印度社會有一套印度式的思想。至於人類思想如何決定實際社會，張先生提出一種特殊的主張，他認爲思想的主動的影響只限於把社會使之平定化與秩序化，但是若有人徒以思想掀起社會變化，這是沒有多大的力量所以張先生說：「社會制度的搖動由於自身的破綻居多，理論只能推波助瀾，不能有所造作；至於由搖動破裂而反趨於穩定，在這個過程中理論的力量却不算小。因爲必須使在一個社會中的人們幾乎個個比較上都承認這樣的組織是適當的或近乎合理，於是人心方安。……由此便使我們知道所以有許多學者出來努力於「理」之說明，想建立學說系統，其實乃只是對於人事想求得一個較好的狀態，或僅求在心理上比較安適的狀態而已。」（八十六頁）</p>
<p>四·中西的道統</p>
<p>中西的道統包括道德標準，社會制度、，和政治原則，而其中必有一套形而上學的玄理爲其骨幹。中國哲學史有一連串的槪念，它們代表中國文化上思想的基型，它們的發展都有其社會背境和社會影響。張先生提出了「天」「道」「德」「仁」「義」「理」「性」「禮」幾個主要的概念，從系統上和發展上加以說明</p>
<p>幷且想從道些槪念之發展的情形上推知社會和政治方面所受的影響。中國的道統在先秦是儒家思想，在宋明是理學思想。古代社會組織總是偏於共同的全體而忽視個人的色彩，中國儒家的重視天或理學家的注重萬物一體，這都是注重全體的思想。中國文化的特質乃是在中國社會中有士階級，而這殷士階級擔負着維　這個道統的工作。</p>
<p>西洋的這統，張先生提出了（一）耶敎思想，（二）社會主義，（三）民主主義二個思想體系。耶敎的敎義可歸結鵝五萬：（1）只信仰一個上帝；（2）以愛爲神的木質，（3）把信仰當做生活；（4）原始罪惡；（5）永生。西洋文化的發展就靠這種基督敎精神的維繫。馬克斯的社會主義也有幾個特有的槪念：（一）餘剩價値稅，（二）唯物史觀，（三）階級鬥爭，（四）對演法（舊譯辯證法），（五）無產階級專政之社會革命說。這種學說的動機仍是救世，並且它的眞切誠意比任何宗敎爲尤甚。民主主義在西洋不僅是一種制度，而且是一個文化，是一個生活方式。這個概念是從社會主義而來的，它含有文化的各方面。民主主義不僅是西洋的道統精神，也是整個人類的至寳。</p>
<p>五·中國文化的出路</p>
<p>中國文化自與西方文化接觸之後，現在正處於一個過渡時期。西方文化第一次從中世紀渡到近世，產生了目然主義，個人主義，民族主義，理性主義，第二次再過渡到現代，現代的思想是社會主義的，國際主義的，情感主義的和全體主義。中國自與西方文化接觸後，她不僅要接受西洋十九世紀的個人主義和自由主義，而且還要同時接受西洋二十世紀的社會主義和全體主義。於是中國便陷於兩重矛盾的生活之中；一方面她要解決中西文化的衝突，一方面又要適應兩種不同的西洋文化。張先生說：「今天中國的問題是在錯過了西方文化階段。……例如中國改換帝制未久，專制之風猶存於人心，論理應只鼓吹自由與民權，而在潮流上又不能不提高政府代表國家整體之義，這樣又無異於助政府以行其專斷的積習了。」</p>
<p>現在解決中國問題的辦法。祇有恢復原有的士階級的使命。讓他們起來用輿論的力量來辨別是非，並可利用國際組織和國際的經濟力量，使這殷士階級的人有一個獨立自主而不受政府牽制的「敎育公會」，使國際的力量對於國內發生道德上的，理性上的，和文化的力量，以作爲建設新中國的新血液。</p>
<h3>「外人在華投資論」</h3>
<p>— 楊揭</p>
<p>著者：F，Remer　譯者：蔣學楷　趙康節　出版者：商務印書館</p>
<p>不平等條約的廢除，激起了許多關心中國經濟建設的朋友的信心，對日戰爭勝利的結束，關於日本海外市塲的替代，國內　本工業設備的利用，更喚起我們的絕大的希望，種種有利的條件似乎已經安排好了，只待我們的努力而已，可是戰爭已經結束到今日，我們不僅沒有看到烟囱的樹立，只是看到相繼停止冒烟。不論是從事輕工業的是重工業的都在感喟着工業危機太嚴重了。這種危機是多方面的外匯政策促進對外貿易的萎靡，〔外匯政策祇是獎勵入口，沒顧到對生產不良的後果〕，通貨膨脹促進了勞資糾紛……關於外匯政策，關於通貨膨脹已有不少學者專文討論了，關於生產三要素之一的資本還很少人討論，特地推薦雷麥（C．F．Remer）「外人在華投資論」一書，我想在今日朝野一致欲促進中國現在化的呼聲中，不是多餘的吧！</p>
<p>這一本唯一的有系統外人在華投資的硏究，雖然引用的資料是一九三〇年以前的資料，但是從旣往事實的槪括，不難尋出外資的形成趨勢及其內在種種因素，做爲我們今日的借鑑，霞麥寫此書的動機完全受太平洋國際學會之委託而寫的，因爲當時中國利用外資及外人在（華投資，不僅是中國人熱心討論的題目，同時也是外人注意的課題所以在太平洋學會開會時曾將外人在華投資列爲主要議題，爲了充分明瞭起見，遂委託雷麥竊成此書。雷麥是一個適當的人選，他在上海聖約翰大學及美國密西根大學任敎多年，學理上是具有素養的人爲了完成此書除發出幾千張調查表外，並到中國各通商口岸及英，美·法·日·南洋各地親自調査這種認眞的精神使此書始有今日的成就！</p>
<p>全書共分上下兩卷，上卷總論外人在華投資及中國在國際上之經濟及金融地位，共分十四章，緒論，中國的人口及富源，舊時代的中國，近代經濟關係，外人在華投資烏瞰，企業投資槪况，企業投資的意義，中國政府的外　，外人投資與收支平衡，華僑匯款，國際貿易與金銀移動，中國的國際收支平衡，中國的國際經濟地位，下卷各論，共分七章，美國在華投資，英國在華投資，日本在華投資，俄國在華投資，法國在華投資，德國在學投資，比　　及北歐　國在舉投資。</p>
<p>總論是　的叙述，著者將外人在華投資分三個時期叙述，一九〇〇以前，一九一四年以前，一九三〇年以前，在譯者認爲這種分法，具有特殊的意義，一九〇〇年以前，正是從雅片戰爭到庚子之變，外人在華投資情形，一九一四年以前，是世界大戰以前的情形，一九三〇年以前是九一八事變以前的情形，這種具有侵略性投資的叙述，我們是不感興趣的，我們所要知道的是另一面。</p>
<p>緒論開首的一句，著者曾這樣說：「外人在華的投資，不過是中國國際經濟關係和中國國際一般關係的一面。看淸楚了這些關係的眞面目，就看淸楚了中國佔據的一部份世界瞭解了這些關係，就瞭解了現代的世界，」有些研究中國經濟的學者，認爲中國的經濟只是一團糟，無原則可尋，或者只是一些偏見的看法，著者似乎有意要避免這些，經過實地老察以後，自信從搜集的事實上，從經濟的分析，上可以得到一些重要事實，但他並不認爲這是純粹客觀的，無成見的，因爲他認爲無論何人，何種團體，在考察他人的行爲，從而下以斷語的時侯，不可能完全用客觀的態度，他的作風只是盡人力而已</p>
<p>著者硏究中國經濟本質的結論，他認爲家庭固然是中國社會的單位，在經濟也是最顯著的單位，這種經濟（經庭經濟）與歐美的經濟（政治經濟）是顯然不同的，歐美的政治經濟，是政治與經濟相互爲表裏的，着重於國家與人民經濟活動的關係，所以一切重商主義，放任政策，新重商主義，只是把經濟和政治納入人種思想與政策的系統，也是所謂經濟上的民族主義，但是著者認爲中國的家庭經濟不是蒙上一個西洋名辭，就可以瞭解的，因爲中國最顯著的事軍，是政治與經濟的分立。</p>
<p>中國發展工業的資本，他認爲在中國人民一般貧生活水準下，想在國內取得是不可能的，雖然他也想到鐵路等營業收入，很可以創設新的建設，但是由於經營不得法及管理不善，這條路似乎也走不通了，因此他認爲資本唯一的來源只有依賴外資，如何取得必需資本，有三條途徑：</p>
<p>（一）依照列强的先例，將一切權力授與政府及官吏。</p>
<p>（二）在中國集體個人主義下，發展私人企業。</p>
<p>（三）共產主義。</p>
<p>他認爲沿著第一條路綫發展很容易趨向國家社會主義，中國傳統政治喜歡這種主義，但是未經過訓練的官吏階級是不易達到此項目的的，第二條要發展私人企業，必須先形成新槪念，並且有一種約束官吏及人民的憲法，把自由給與私人企業，並且担保其權利，第三條是農村傳統歡迎的，但是要成功的話，必須適應家庭與農村，可是欲領導中國的經濟發展，郤是一個不易實現的夢，總結一句，他雖提供了三條路綫，只是着重第一二兩條，所以在第七章企業投資的意義又重復叙到中國未來經營組織路綫有二條，一條是政府領導國家社會主義，一條是商人領導下適於中國業　　人主義的私人企業。</p>
<p>下　分個　　的　　各個在羣投資的實况，限於篇幅不能作詳畫的叙述。</p>
<p>著者有一句話說「中國政治的安全，端賴經濟的安全，中網經濟的安全亦端賴政治的安全。」在今日似乎更具另一層意農，中自工業化是必要的資本，又是不可缺少的，論不可失，希望政府閉眼界，大胆做去，更希望在野的人士推動這件事，不要讓以後來追悔今日的愚蠢！</p>
<h3>介紹「不列顛自治領」</h3>
<p>— 孫杭</p>
<p>樓邦產著　商務出版</p>
<p>不列期帝國是一個歷史的產物，因之，要以邏輯的觀點分析不列顚的組成是很困難的。也許說得好一點，不列顚自身即是一套特殊的邏輯，和別的旣成的系統不能相混淆。</p>
<p>舉一個例說，用近代國家的觀念說不列顚是一個國家，這句話是對的，但也是錯的。不列顚是一個大國家，有國家的應有的要素，但不列顚內部的組成份子，尤其是那些自治領，却決不是一個國家裏的省或地方政府，而也彷彿是些天大小小的國家。譬如，在聯合國機構下，不列顚的自治領加拿大，澳大里亞等，和別的國家是分庭抗禮，同其地位的。又如不列顚其他部分和德國宣戰，而愛爾蘭却可安心保守中立。這些，對於守　輯的政制研究者是一種神秘，也是一種挑戰。但這不是不列顚的過失，硏究一件事物，本該就事論事的。</p>
<p>爲此，研究不列顚的組成，尤其是不列顚本部和自治領間的關係，成套的政治理論有時是用不着而且行不通的。有了一點政治智識的人，讀關於不列顚制度的著作，往往反覺難以索解。講述不列顚制度的人，必須把特殊性先提出來，講個透澈，然後讓讀者自己把它和傳統理論比較，或者便捷一點，作者自己帮助讀者比較；最不該先把傳統理論削足適履，然後，忽略了那些不列顚式的優美，而加以批評。</p>
<p>樓邦彥先生近著不列顚自治傾，即頗有此風格。這是一本薄薄不足百頁的小書，中間包括了樓先生近作關於不列顚自治領的論文六篇，雖然在系統方面不是一本書而是六篇文章的合訂，但對於一位入門者或懂得一些政制的人，却很能引之入勝。</p>
<p>這裏面的敍述是很平易的。沒有大堆的政治理論，沒有强求的苟合邏輯，樓先生不過把不列顚制度，以不列顚方式描寫，我們好像瀏覽一過，就好像坐了流線型不列顚車，在不列顚地方旅行，一切都是不列顚的，很舒適而自然。</p>
<p>全書敍述事實的地方多，分析也很詳實。對不懂悍不列顚體制的人，這是一本入門書；對懂得甚多傳統理論的人，這是一本參攷書。</p>
<p>但六篇文章不是同時寫成也不是同時發表的。意思不免有重覆的地方，讀者應瞭解作者寫的不是番而是雜誌文，不要太苛求他。六篇的內容如下：第一，不列顚自治領和英王。第二，不列顚自治領和英國國會。第三，不列顚自治領和帝國會議。第四不列顚自治領的對外關係。第五，不列顚自治領和戰爭。第六，不列顚帝國的締約權。</p>
<p>在每篇之中，歷史的記載是很有價値的。不列顚不是生來就是現在的式樣，她是歷史的產物，不懂得她的歷史，便不能談她的制度。樓先生很能抓住這一點機會，他談的前因後果，很可使讀者覺得頭頭是道。</p>
<p>六章之中，第一章述英王和自治領的關係，最爲透關。英王是不列顚的特徵，也可說是不列顚制度的來源。懂得了英王的地位，我們對於不列顚，就已有了一個槪念。因之，懂了第一章，以後各章，順次而下，便無困難了。第四，五，六，三章，討論的主題其實是一個，即不列顚自，治領的對外關係。三童有共通性，有連貫性，正如建築師打的圖樣，由三方面看，一座立體的房屋情形，便一覽無遺了。</p>
<p>書末附有書評兩篇介紹關於不列顚問題的兩種書籍。第二篇書評的開頭，樓先生說：「關於不列顯帝國的：般問題的書籍並不能算少，但要得一本比較淺近的而爲一般讀者所容易瞭解的却是相當困難。Slephen　Leacock新近所著的「不列顚帝國」一書，倒能滿足深入淺出的條件，可爲一般的讀者介紹。」我以爲樓先生所著「不列顚自治領」，也頗能滿足這條件，可爲一般的讀者介紹的。</p>
<h3>本欄增設：讀書信箱</h3>
<p>近來有一部分靑年好學的朋友時常寫信來問編者怎樣讀書和讀些甚麽書。所以我們預備在下期本刋增設讀書信箱，想有系統的介紹給讀者各方面的書籍，並願意替讀者解答各種有關於讀書的問題，歡迎來信質詢。</p>
<h3>文化消息</h3>
<p>文潮掛版社發行之「文潮月刋」一卷二期，業於本月一日出版，內容有鄭伯奇之民族研究與文藝大衆化。李健吾之福樓拜和屠格湼甫。趙景深之讀康對山文集。臧克家之家書。老舍與趙淸閣合編之金聲玉振等十餘篇。內容極爲精彩。每册仍售六百元。由正中書局總經售云。</p>
<p>女作家鳳子，前因患盲腸炎，經第五醫院割治後，經過良好，現已移住虹口文潮出版社。遵醫囑須閉戶靜養，故最近尙不能從事文字工作云。</p>
<p>我國科學落後，一般人的科學知識也很貧乏。根據本市社會局的統計，在申請登記的六十五種刋物中，祇有五種是科學的。當這需要科學建國的期間，中國電機工程師學會，担負這鼓吹及灌輸電學知識的任務，出版一種大衆化的電學刋物—「電世界月刋」，該刋創刋號已於六月一日出版。在編排和內容方面，都是以普及爲目標的。將來對於取材，倘能儘量大衆化，俾和中國一般科學知識水準相配合，幷且多加插圖以補文字解釋的不足。該刋由中國科學公司發行，已在本外埠書店從攤發售。</p>
<p>讀「第二年代」　士</p>
<p>崔萬秋名普「第二年代」，在重慶一版，再版，三版，均銷售一空，紐約先鋒論壇報社論曾撰文爲評，認爲抗戰八年期內，有二部長篇小說很有價値，値得一讀，一即「第二年代」，還有一部則爲張恨水之「大江東去」。</p>
<p>滬版「第二年代」，業經出先生加以增删，讀者書店出版，內容係寫徐州大會戰與武漢大會戰時，一對兒女私情的故事，先鋒論壇報對它的評價，不是一般尋常慈愛小說，空中樓閣，注重生意眼，適合低級趣味之類的小說所可比擬，在嚴　戰爭氛圍裏，其間或以自己身世，或以刻劃社會形態，切切實實地寫出來，如非實事，焉能如比迫眞。</p>
<p>我讀「第二年代」，從作者平淡的叙述裏，對華擷小姐的那種嫣憨，智慧，小家碧玉具有女人天賦美的神情，立刻會在腦際反映出來。</p>
<p>柳劍嗚的　與雷大聲發生不正當的事，劍嗚恢傷着說：一夫妻間的愛情並不是絕對的，男女間一分開，很容易出毛病，這個我十分明白。不過我和她才分別了半年的光景，我的生死還未弄明白，她已經琵琶別抱了，這未免使人太覺得寒心。天下男人多得很，爲什麽不找別人，而偏偏找到我的同鄕，我的同學，我的同事？」道敎我們何忍卒讀？不免爲之同情！柳劍嗚是影射現在陸軍總部裏一位很活躍的處長。</p>
<p>其他如寫林文華師長的個性，說他粗枝大葉，爽直明快，確確實實是軍人本色，足見作者生活範圍的廣</p>
<p>所謂低調俱樂部的二位角兒朱佛山指的周佛海，孟伯文即會仲明是極明顯的筆法。低調俱樂部乃擷華小姐等所不願去的，從低調俱樂部裏，可以見到朱佛山，孟伯文一流是何等樣的人了。　「第二年代」主要寫葉惟明與鄭擷華從抗戰前認識，抗戰後輾轉從事救國工作，大都是作者本人的實際生活，所以寫來津有味入木三分，葉惟明千里迢迢去戰地看愛人，眞是：「愛人使愚蠢的人變為明聰。」「不愛淸　　　人爲愚蠢。」</p>

<h3>糧食部的諷刺</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>讀了江蘇區監察使署爲糾舉糧貸舞弊致行政院的一封公函後，令人髮指，令人痛心！</p>
<p>全上海市民都應該站出來，支持程監察使這一件糾舉案，要求政府將道幾個貪汚凟職玩視民命的贓官梟首，以振法紀，以肅貪汚，否則，這一股憤怒的熱火，燃燒着會使每個市民瘋狂，而將激成其它非常不測的事件的。</p>
<p>政府舉辦糧貸，原爲救濟民食，現在從監察使署這封公函所調查而列舉的十項事實看來，糧食無異剝削市民，加重市民負担，讓幾個糧官發財。我們要問政府，是不是這樣的目的？如果不是，這幾個臟官怎麽辦？讓他們逍遙海外嗎？讓他們喫飽了市民的血在那裏享福消受嗎？老實說，這件驚人的貪凟案，我們想信政府一定會「刑亂國用重典，懲一以儆百」的，因爲沒有任何理由政府不這麽做。</p>
<p>社會風氣壞到這步田地，許多人都駡奸商，我們承認商中有奸，但他們爲什麽有這胆子敢於作奸犯科的呢？難道眞的愍不畏法嗎？從糧貸案更可使我們相信有一批貪官在和他們勾結，在替他們撑腰，給他們便利，來串同剝削小民。</p>
<p>最後，我們大家要密切注意這件事的發展，這批貪官奸商的神通相當不小，他們會使用各種方法來逃避，不信，就在發表江蘇區監察使署糾舉這件案子的同一天，糧食部就有一個所謂「撤消上海糧政處，另設上海儲運處」的新聞發佈，還是楊錫志處長，葉新明汪達人副處長，換湯不換藥，這是一種障眼法。</p>
<p>是糧食部在和江蘇區監察署使開玩笑罷，我們有這樣的一種感覺，然而糧食部未免太威風凜凜，因爲這種諷刺爲任何人所難以承受的。</p>
<h3>警管區制之前列</h3>
<p>— 金夑山</p>
<p>昨日遇到了一位候君，他任職於××區警察局，順便談起了警官區制問題。</p>
<p>候君是北平人，畢定於黃埔軍官學校，服務警局多年，對於警察學理論及實踐都有豐富的經騐。我們的談話是這樣開始的。</p>
<p>『警管區制這一名詞實在太對我們陌生了。』我先這樣說。</p>
<p>『不，這一個名詞實在早就有了的。』他感到很有興趣：「在戰前北平就已實行了好多年，而且收到了很好的效果，警民打成一片，的確是做到的，一種和協的氣氛，誰見了都會感到一種和洽的快樂。』</p>
<p>『喔，但對警察訪問的進行，爲什麼一定要在晚間呢？這似乎太對市民的安居有了很大的妨礙！』我奇怪的問。</p>
<p>『這都是一種反宜傳的擾動，』他說『一般市民對於警管區制引起的惶惶不安都是這一種荒謬的謠言所造成的。訪問爲什麽一定要在半夜呢？這種謠言，顯然可以不攻自破，沒有特意的事故發生，這是決不會有的事！至於以前北平所實行的訪問方式，却並不是像現在一般人想像中好像警察局就帶了一隊人像模像樣叩門而入滔滔不休問東問西的令人厭煩，而卻在一種有意無意之間。』他略頓了一會又說：</p>
<p>『譬如一個警察要去訪問某一個居民，他可以揀着×先生有空或在路中閉蕩的時候，於是他——警察就可以用各種不同而自然的方式與他所要訪問的人閒談起來，決不會使他感到有一些麻煩，日久他們竟然會成爲了一對要好的朋友似的，警察固然已可以很隨便的進入居民的住屋——像訪問一個老朋友似的——歇歇脚，或喝一杯茶而受到歡迎，居民也可以很隨意的進入警察局點一下頭就借用電話，這就大家感到很大的方便。以前北平的市民對於警察局的印象決不爲像今日上海一般市民一提起警察局就會感到恐懼的反應，這實在也可以說是一種警管區制實行後的附帶的效果。因爲才有這樣，警民才可以得到眞正的合作。」</p>
<p>『那末實行警管制確切的目的是什麼呢？』我又問。</p>
<p>『對於這一個問題，一般人所知道的警員的責任就在捕捉犯法的人，這當然是應有的責任。但警察局最高的目的却不是以捉人爲唯一的終極的責任，至善至美的警察局的施政，却應去預防犯罪的發生，警管區制大致是多了這樣一個目的而產生的。因爲人民的得能安居樂業，就在應當沒有不幸的事情發生，否則發生了事，卽使有警察局的協助破案，但也總究是不安過了。所以預防罪案的發生才是警局最高的任務。警管區制的實行，就將執行此種任務，確切明瞭一般市民的生活情形與宵小的遁迹所在，試問，宵小在有防備的監視下，將何從施其技呢？人民的安居樂業不就有了保障！』</p>
<p>『警管區制是不是也將要協助政治方面的工作。』我問。</p>
<p>『這是絕不會有的事，警管區制完全是爲了防備宵小闖肇事端。政治是政治，警務是警務；這是分得很淸楚的，如因爲這一點而所以引起某一些人的不安，這是非常的多餘的！」</p>
<p>這一席談，使我對警管區制有了一層新的認識，並且也掃去了對於某些報紙上不良宣傳所沾染上或多或少的陰霾印象。</p>

<h3>白虎生涯</h3>
<p>— 黃權</p>
<p>人家稱我們「僕歐」或「侍應」，我們却自稱「白號衣」。每天在酒樓，茶室，咖啡館，服務十二小時以上的工作。</p>
<p>早晨九時到服務塲所，點名受領班指使，擦地板臘，揩桌椅，抹銀器皿，醬油瓶，杯碟，直到十一時許，齊吃午飯。飯後起始開市，客人進來吃西餐，吃中菜咖啡茶點，輪流不息，每人被派好負責的桌數伺候，從端茶擺碗筷到吃完，其間要問吃什么？多少客？劃火柴，遞手巾，送衣帽，開帳單，對待客人絕對和顏悅色，週到萬分，因爲客人就是衣食父毋。領班監視下，一刻不能離，如此一小時一小時站下去，直到深夜下班，趕着宵禁鐘點歸家。</p>
<p>生意好時忙得透不過氣，碰着偶而錯誤，客人逃了帳，或送錯了食品，脾氣壞的客人，那就倒霉。受了氣往肚裏吞。沒有生意時，和熟客談天，同事互相開玩笑，所以見聞特多，誰有秘事也瞞不了，男女同事更坦白得近乎下流，要談戀愛也容易，早晨早起，夜間同歸，便是機會。</p>
<p>工作總是苦樂不均的；一年四季穿白衣裳，一定制服，冷天冷，熱天熱，腿站酸了也不能坐。每星期祗有三四小時空班，深夜歸家容易得病。有趣的是看暴發戶吃西餐，手忙脚亂，付不出帳的空頭少爺的窘態，老而不死的尖頭　獻媚女人的醜相。捉狹的把不新鮮的點心菜餚給客人和洋琴鬼吃，好的却自己掉包，帶回家當早餐。到十一時許客人走盡時，排排坐定聽洋琴鬼奏樂，他們不到鐘點不能休息，簡直氣死。</p>
<p>「白號衣」們的收入全靠檯面小帳二成，及另賞。每月照成數攤派，經理等佔去百分之二，普通現在每月得十萬多些，正薪卻祇有三千元吧了。所以全着生意如何，或尋尋外快，否則也養不活家的。</p>
<p>爲了工作時間過長，每日少見陽光，缺少運動，辛勞過度等，我們身體多數不康健、可怕的更易生肺病。從學校裏出來做過五年後，每感覺到甚麽學識都忘掉，做的刻板的工作，把靑春壯志都消逝了的悲哀。</p>

<h3>婦女頭髮式樣　政府規定一律？</h3>
<p>— 武陵人</p>
<p>回到上海後第一個給吾惡印象，是許多熱鬧馬路邊牆脚下，任人小溲，幾成公厠，滿地流淌，行人掩鼻而過，旣碍衛生，且極不雅，敵偽盤踞下之所謂市政由此可知。</p>
<p>翻開二十年前舊報，一件小小盜案新聞，每有「明火執杖」，「呼嘯而逸」的習用字句，殊覺可笑。其實一二凶徒入室行刦，「執杖」或有之，「明火」則似乎形容過甚；「呼嘯而逸」更覺荒唐。倒不如「袖出手槍嚇禁聲張」，……雖然亦已成爲俗套，總還比較近乎情理。</p>
<p>據說分配房屋委員會人員，最近出發調査日僑遺留房屋時，往往査明爲空屋，而一轉瞬間已被人遷入佔據，且此佔據者之目的，大都不在自已居住，而在輾轉出頂，從中牟利，遂使眞正無屋居住者，益感覓屋之難。吳市長蒞任以後，對抑平米價消弭工潮，曾盡最大努力，不肖米商多人被捕後，確已使米市穩定多多；希望對於解決房荒問題，同樣採取嚴厲辦法，懲一儆百，此其時矣。</p>
<p>有幾家報上所排外長王世杰之「杰」字，右上角多一點，遂成「杰」字，似乎特地指出外交部長肩上一副擔子之沉重。</p>
<p>駐滬美國某軍事機關中高級長官詢其屬下華籍女職員，謂「中國一般婦女之頭髮式樣，甚少差別，是否爲政府所規定」。大致外國人在吾國看到「一律」的事太少了，有之其在婦女頭上乎。</p>

<p>「美女牌棒氷，……」</p>
<p>這時候，弄口走出一個八九歲的男孩子，他拉着他的母親，說「姆媽，買一根棒氷給我吃！』她（他的母親）搖搖頭說：『寳寳，棒氷不好吃，吃了要肚子痛的！明犬我……』</p>
<p>『不，棒氷好吃的，學堂裏他們都吃的，你買一根給我吃吧！』孩子哀求着。</p>
<p>「我明天買朱古力糖給你吃！朱古力糖眞好吃哩，寳寳乖！』她想騙騙他，其實她那裏有錢買朱古力糖。</p>
<p>『不要吃吃朱古力糖，要吃棒水！』</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>她經他幾次的要求，才答應他。</p>
<p>「買棒氷，幾鈿？』賣棒氷的應時而停住他的脚步，說：『棒氷二百五十元，氷淇淋六百元！』</p>
<p>她聽到這回答，若有所思地望着她的兒子，他當時也好像　事一樣默默不作聲。</p>
<p>『儂買哦？」賣棒氷的不耐煩地問。</p>
<p>『媽』小孩子朝著他的母親，親切地呌了一聲。</p>
<p>『不要了！」——『不，我要吃！』</p>
<p>靜默了一會兒，她終於拿出二百五十元買了一根，當孩子拿到棒氷，會心的笑了一笑。</p>
<p>賣棒水的孩子又提高了嗓子，勝利地喊着：『美女牌棒氷！……」</p>
<p>他聽了這呌喊聲又笑了一　，可是她却在估計：『又去了　天薪水的四分之一！』</p>

<h3>Military Trio Met Yesterday Morning: Regarding the Transgressions of the Communist Army Inside and Outside the Pass, Ma and Xu Personally Requested Zhou to Quickly Devise Measures to Stop Them</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The preliminary consultations of the Military Trio Conference have become concrete since General Xu Yongchang met with Zhou Enlai at Meiyuan New Village last night and directly exchanged opinions. However, the two sides still have some differences on the Northeast issue, the issue of cease-fire and military reorganization, and the issue of restoring transportation. They agreed to go to Marshall's residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road this morning to discuss with Ambassador Marshall. Before 10 o'clock this morning, Xu and Zhou arrived at Ambassador Marshall's residence successively, and after discussing with Ambassador Marshall once, Ambassador Marshall then met with Xu and Zhou to formally exchange opinions on various difficult issues to be resolved. However, according to people in Ambassador Marshall's residence, although the representatives of the three parties in today's Military Trio Group meeting have met and discussed, it was not a formal meeting. It is reported that General Xu Yongchang paid a visit to the Chairman this afternoon, and it is also reported that Ma and Xu personally requested Zhou Enlai to quickly devise measures to stop the Communist army's transgressions inside and outside the pass, and restore the original situation before 12 noon on the 7th to avoid hindering negotiations. If this yields results, the Military Trio Conference may be held immediately. Shao Lizi returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 12th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] General Marshall first met with Mr. Zhou for half an hour today, and then went to the Chairman's residence to meet with the Chairman for two hours. The topic of the meeting was whether there are any supplementary plans or any methods for permanently resolving the issue after the expiration of the truce agreement on the 15th, but nothing was announced.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] According to the opinions of most observers, the final success or failure of Special Envoy Marshall's mission in China will be decided within the next ten days. Most people familiar with China's national conditions and public sentiment say that if Ambassador Marshall's efforts for a permanent truce cannot produce reasonable hope before the expiration of the truce order on the 22nd of this month, he will return home. At the same time, many people also strongly stated that even if Ambassador Marshall cannot promote a rapid and lasting solution to China's internal affairs, the Chinese people unanimously recognize that Ambassador Marshall is the most appropriate mediator for the long-standing disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If Ambassador Marshall fails, it is definitely not due to his own fault or lack of ability, but purely because the problem is too confusing and difficult to solve. Generally speaking, among people who dare to say that there is still hope for the permanent peace between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, only about one in five people. Ambassador Marshall's tireless efforts prove that he himself does not hold such a view.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Li Huang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Youth Party, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and convened a party affairs meeting with the main personnel of the party in the afternoon. On the Civil League side, Shen Junru, Zhang Junmai, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, etc., reviewed the recent situation in the Northeast yesterday morning, and Zhang Junmai and Huang Yanpei sent a letter inviting Li Huang of the Youth Party to exchange opinions at Zhang's residence at 3 pm this afternoon, and Mo Dehui will also be invited to participate.</p>
<h3>Du Yuming Arrived in Changchun from Shenyang: Before Departure, He Notified the Communist Army to Withdraw from Lafa and Stop Attacking, Otherwise the CCP Should Bear All Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 12th] General Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters, arrived in Changchun by special plane at 11:25 am on the 12th. After getting off the plane, he took a car directly to Chairman Liang's residence to rest. Commander Du declared: This visit to Changchun is to represent Chairman Chiang in comforting the people of the Northeast and to solicit the opinions of the elders of the Northeast in order to quickly achieve the purpose of pacifying the local area and stabilizing the people's livelihood. Du also said: Since the government took over the Northeast, this is his third visit to Changchun. If time permits, he will go to various places to comfort and inspect.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 11th] Cai Zonglian, the government representative of the Military Mediation Department, accompanied Rao Shushi, the CCP representative of the Changchun Executive Division, to visit Commander Du on the 11th for about half an hour. After Commander Du received the order to stop pursuing and advancing in the Northeast, the military units had completely stopped advancing at 12 noon on the 7th. However, the Communist army took the opportunity to attack the National Army in various places, which seemed to be a planned action. In particular, near Lafa, the main force was concentrated to attack, causing a regiment of the National Army to suffer losses. He made a special request to Rao Shushi, hoping that he would immediately telegram the front to withdraw from Lafa and stop all attacks by noon on the 12th, otherwise, the CCP should be responsible for all unfortunate events caused by the accident. Rao said: The Northeast Truce Order was only read in the newspaper, and the CCP has not received a formal order. This truce order is a national consensus between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and senior CCP officials should not deny it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th] Since the Communist army besieged the old and new stations of Lafa on the 7th, they have repeatedly increased their troops and cut off the rear of the National Army. As of the 10th, they have increased to 21 infantry regiments and 1 artillery regiment, launching a full-scale attack, and even using heavy artillery and mountain artillery to concentrate fire on Lafa, causing a major fire in the entire area and destroying all houses. The National Army adhered to the order, strictly observed good faith, and did not increase reinforcements or counterattack. However, the regiment of the National Army stationed there, confronted by an isolated army and a disparity in strength, was forced to withdraw to the Xiaogujiazi Mihua line. Regiment Commander Wei Yaodong was killed in action, and more than half of all officers and soldiers were killed or wounded.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] Major General Zhou Liwu and more than a dozen other government personnel of the Military Mediation Changchun Branch departed from Beiping by special plane to Changchun at 7 am on the 12th. Currently, government and American personnel have gathered in Changchun one after another. After the personnel of the CCP arrive, they can start mediation work in Changchun.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 12th] Government and American representatives of the Military Mediation Executive Department today denied the CCP's claim that Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters, had notified the Military Mediation Department that his troops had resumed the offensive and declared that the truce agreement on the 15th was invalid.</p>
<h3>Nanjing is Actively Preparing for the Election of Senators</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Nanjing is actively preparing for the election of senators. It is learned that the number of senators to be elected is stipulated by law. For those with a population of more than 100,000, 19 regional representatives should be elected, and one additional representative should be added for every 30,000 beyond that. According to the statistics in April, the population of Nanjing has reached 703,906, and there should be 39 representatives, plus 17 professional representatives, for a total of 56 people. It is heard that this work can be started in August.</p>
<h3>Minister Peng Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters: The Current Situation is Extremely Serious: American Representatives Must Have Arbitral Power, Otherwise All Agreements Will Be Empty Words</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 4:30 pm on the 12th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The following is a record of the main questions and answers:</p>
<p>Question: The Communist Party said that when the government issued the order to stop the conflict, it began a large-scale attack in eastern China. If this is true, why did the government take this action of attack when this permanent agreement is about to be established?</p>
<p>Answer (Minister Peng): This is the old method of Communist propaganda, that is, to blame the other party for the evil deeds it has done. It is very easy to prove which side launched the attack. Before June 7, Lafa and Texas were originally in the hands of the government army, but now they are in the hands of the Communist army. Three hours after the order to stop military action was issued, the Communist army attacked Lafa, and then launched a large-scale attack on Texas, massacring countless government troops and local people. On June 9, the Communist army blew up the Hanzhuang Bridge on the Lusu border canal. The Communist army is concentrating its troops, attempting to attack Jinan and Qingdao. The Communist army's strategy is clearly to use the 15-day truce period to occupy cities as much as possible. They especially want to seize the entire Shandong Province, divide China into two parts, north and south, and strengthen the danger of the national economy. This kind of behavior reminds people of the mission of Kiso Saburo in Washington. I would like to call the attention of the whole country to the seriousness of the current situation. The Communist army must withdraw from the cities it has occupied since June 7, and quickly restore the transportation lines it has destroyed, in order to remove the major obstacles to negotiations. Some people say that the attack on Lafa, Texas and other places was an order issued before June 7, and because the telegram was delayed, it was not stopped in time. We will retreat 100 steps, assuming that this statement is not false, and regardless of the losses of the government army and innocent people, we still feel that it is very easy for the Communist Party to prove its sincerity. The simplest way is to withdraw from the cities that were forcibly occupied after June 7, otherwise it is difficult to shirk the responsibility for destroying the truce agreement. Many observers believe that the Communist Party's strategy is to delay comprehensively and infiltrate locally. Recent events have confirmed that this statement is not wrong. The government army has been ordered by the Chairman to only defend and not attack, and after taking back the seized location, it must not pursue.</p>
<p>Question: Regarding the negotiations between the government and the Communist Party, can you give an interim report to clarify various rumors?</p>
<p>Answer (Minister Peng): The central issue of recent negotiations is how to ensure the rapid and effective implementation of all agreements and avoid such delays. Therefore, the government insists that the American representative must have the power of arbitration. This suggestion was proposed by our side on its own initiative. Without this arbitration, all agreements will be empty words and will never be realized. The Communist Party still rejected this suggestion after General Zhou Enlai returned to Nanjing from Yan'an. We still remember that we suggested that for the dispatched teams of the Mediation Executive Department, as long as two of the three people agree, a decision can be made. The Communist Party also opposed this point. With so many trivial matters and endless disputes, how can the agreement be realized? Regarding the power of arbitration, the government also informed the Communist Party that if there is a better way, it can be proposed for discussion, but the Communist Party has not yet proposed any method.</p>
<p>Question: Will the Trio Conference resolve political disputes or military conflicts?</p>
<p>Answer (Minister Peng): Within the 15-day period, three of the most pressing issues must be resolved, namely, stopping the conflict, restoring transportation, and reorganizing and unifying the army. After these issues are resolved, other political issues will not be difficult to solve, and most of them have already been resolved by the Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<h3>The Situation in North China is Becoming More and More Tense: Generals in Various Places Send Urgent Telegrams to the Ministry of National Defense for Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Today is the sixth day of the effective period of the truce. Early in the morning, news came that Dawenkou was attacked by the Communist army again. The situation in North China is becoming more and more tense. It is heard that generals such as Li Zongren, Liu Zhi, Sun Lianzhong, Yan Xishan, Fu Zuoyi, and Wang Yaowu have successively telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense to report the serious situation caused by the large-scale offensive of the Communist army and requested instructions on how to deal with it. It is heard that the extensive offensive launched by the Communist army in North China this time, the troops assembled, the weapons equipped, and the unpredictable Japanese bombers that cooperated with the ground troops in combat, seemed to have been fully prepared in advance, which is extremely noteworthy. The most difficult thing for the National Army in various places at present is that they must absolutely adopt a defensive posture within the truce deadline, and because there are many places to defend, it is impossible to defend against everything. If the Communist army concentrates its forces and chooses a point to attack fiercely, the National Army will suffer a great loss due to being caught off guard. In Lafa outside the pass and Texas inside the pass, the defending troops have made tragic sacrifices, just because they are in an unfavorable position of being beaten. Therefore, the morale of the National Army soldiers in various places has been extremely angry and resentful due to being burned by anger. According to a senior military official: This point can be used as a reference for the CCP, do not take temporary pleasure and leave yourself with endless troubles.</p>
<h3>Zaozhuang Commander Captured</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 11th] Wang Gang, the commander of the Zaozhuang garrison, has been captured by the Communist army, and Wang Jimei, the commander of the unit, was killed in battle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 12th] Major Lei Fenqiang, the government representative of the Yancheng Transportation Team, was shot and killed by the Communist army near Sangzidian on the 10th. Currently, Lei's body has been sent to Jinan Station this morning. It is reported that Lei was a major staff officer of the Second Pacification Zone Command, only in his twenties. It is a pity that he suffered this tragic murder. In addition to the resolutions reached in the consultations in Yancheng, Lei also carried detailed records of the Communist army's three destructions of the railway between June 7 and 9.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Attacking Qingdao Repelled</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 12th] The Communist army's siege of Qingdao is becoming increasingly urgent. At about 10 pm on the 12th, more than 20 junks gathered again and attacked the central area, attempting to land, but were repelled by the combined efforts of the defending troops and the navy. Fierce battles also broke out on the Qingdao Jimo border on the evening of the 12th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] The Communist army in Weixian, Gaomi, Jimo, Chengyang and other places attacked the National Army on the night of the 8th and are currently engaged in fierce battles.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 12th] The Communist army attacking Chengyang has been repelled after two days of fierce fighting. The Communist army is now concentrating its main force in the Dongdaguan area, five kilometers north of Chengyang, confronting us.</p>
<h3>Cooke Flew to Nanjing Yesterday to Discuss the Qingdao Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Admiral Cooke, Commander of the US Seventh Fleet, flew from Shanghai to Nanjing on the morning of the 12th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Admiral Cooke, Commander-in-Chief of the US Navy in China, flew to Nanjing from Shanghai by special plane yesterday (12th) morning, with the appearance that the Communist army in Shandong Province is expanding its rebellion and is prepared to attack Qingdao at any moment, for important consultations with Special Envoy Marshall. General predictions are that General Cooke may go to Qingdao after completing his official duties in Nanjing, and consult with General Loji, Commander of the US Marine Corps in China, and General Kliman, Commander of the US Marine Corps in Qingdao, who flew to Qingdao from Tianjin the day before, to find appropriate methods that suit the environment. The US Navy authorities here refused to discuss what attitude and actions the US Navy in Qingdao will take towards the current critical situation, but said: The US Navy generals in Ningdao are currently in consultation, and they do not want to be attacked by others. The decision to adapt to the situation in Qingdao may be announced after consultation. The US Navy expressed surprise at the Communist army's sudden attack on Shandong Province, but the US Marine Corps in Qingdao is currently using the airport in the north of the city and the shipyard in the east of the city for external transportation as before.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] This afternoon, Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, was surrounded by several reporters at the welcoming ceremony for Cardinal Tian Gengxin and asked for his thoughts on the current situation after the issuance of the truce announcement. According to Chen, the truce is in vain if it is discussed without reorganizing the army and restoring transportation, and the war inside and outside the pass are two different things. The National Army outside the pass went to take over based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty. For example, a house whose sovereignty belongs to me should be taken over, but someone refuses to let it go, so the police should be asked to drive them out.</p>

<h3>The French Government Has Taken Steps to Help Our Country Solve the Food Shortage: A Large Amount of Rice and Wheat from French Indochina Can Be Shipped to China</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] According to an announcement here, after Song Ziwen, President of the Executive Yuan of China, requested the French Ambassador to China, Merhei, to forward a request to the French government to cooperate in solving the Chinese food crisis, the French government has taken various steps to help China smoothly overcome the current food crisis. The French side quickly allocated 500 tons of rice for China's disposal, and part of it has been loaded onto the French cruiser "Tourville" to Shanghai. At the same time, there is also a batch of broken wheat, totaling 13,000 tons, which has also been allocated for China's disposal and is waiting for export. The Anglo-American-Canadian Combined Food Board has been notified of this matter. The Chinese government is currently taking various necessary steps to purchase this batch of stored grain in the United States. In addition, France will ship a large amount of rice to China in the second half of this year. Before the end of this year, Vietnam has more than 150,000 tons of rice available for export.

<h3>The Coming Ten Days are "Decisive Days": Central Daily News Publishes Commentary on the CCP Issue, Hoping the Communist Party Will Leave a Ray of Hope for the People</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Today, the Central Daily News published an article entitled "Decisive Days," discussing the issue of a ceasefire between the KMT and the CCP. The newspaper believes that enhancing General Marshall's arbitration authority is the last resort to achieving peace between the two armies. It also stated that if the Communist army captures Jinan or continues to obstruct the Northeast's takeover at this time, it should be considered the beginning of the party's rebellion. The newspaper also advocated that if the Communist Party attacks the National Army in any location, the National Army should immediately counterattack. However, the counteroffensive should stop when it reaches the original defensive line, awaiting the best possible mediation. The article points out, "As of today, the Communist Party has shown no sign of a ceasefire. Its intensified military actions are cooperating with its propaganda offensive, which confuses black and white. With only ten days left in the ceasefire period, the Communist Party has not been able to prove its sincerity in the ceasefire with facts. This is undoubtedly a heartless blow to the Chinese people who earnestly seek peaceful unification. Isn't it also a great irony for General Marshall, who has traveled tens of thousands of miles for the peaceful unification of China? Does the Communist Party not know that the people's hope for peace is greater than that of a hungry infant waiting for milk? Does it not know that General Marshall and even all of China's friends around the world hope for China's stability more than a severe drought hopes for rain clouds? And does it not know that the people's and the government's tolerance has its limits? Then why is it unwilling to immediately abandon its attempt to divide the Northeast, dismember China, destroy transportation, and massacre the people? Is the Communist Party really a different kind of people, who have long lost normal human nature? The past is gone, but the future can be pursued. We hope that the Communist Party will cherish the hard-won sovereignty for the country, leave a ray of hope for the people, understand that the government's tolerance cannot be limitless, and value General Marshall's friendship of mediating for China's peaceful unification despite traveling tens of thousands of miles. It should quickly abandon its violent doctrine and power politics, put away its attempt at a full-scale rebellion, and stop its mad attacks in the Northeast and Shandong. The coming ten days are decisive days, because it is the crossroads for the entire nation and all its people, and also the dividing line between whether the Communist Party is willing to leave a way out for the entire nation and a ray of hope for all the people."</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Returns to Shanghai by Plane from Taiwan: Talks About Impressions After Inspection, Expresses Hope That Chinese People Will Jointly Plan Construction Due to Lack of Talent</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] He Yingqin flew to Taiwan from Shanghai a few days ago for an inspection, stayed for five days, and returned to Shanghai from Taiwan yesterday at 12:40 noon. He refused to talk about military issues. When reporters asked about his views on the overall situation, he said he did not want to make any criticism. He also did not want to express opinions on the work of the Military Mediation Office. When reporters asked when he would go abroad to participate in the United Nations Military Staff Committee meeting, he said that the date had not yet been determined and he was afraid that he would not be able to leave this month. However, the responsibilities of the headquarters had been properly handed over. He would return to Nanjing today or tomorrow. Before going abroad, he would inspect the Northeast and Northwest to understand the domestic situation after the war. This trip to Taiwan was entirely for inspection purposes. When reporters asked him to share his impressions of the inspection of Taiwan, he said that he had visited seven places in Taiwan, including Taipei, Keelung, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, for five days. His impressions included the following: (1) Over the past 50 years, the Japanese have achieved considerable success in managing Taiwan, whether in military, political, economic, transportation, or agricultural, forestry, industrial, and mining construction. Moreover, every undertaking is large-scale and well-planned. Their meticulous planning and hardworking spirit are truly worthy of our vigilance. (2) The national concept and ethnic consciousness of the Taiwanese compatriots are very strong. Although they have been under foreign rule for 50 years, they have not forgotten their motherland and have not been assimilated by foreigners. This spirit is extremely gratifying. (3) The most important work and difficult problems in Taiwan at present are two points: First, the education problem. We cannot deny that the colonial education implemented by the Japanese in Taiwan has had some adverse effects on some Taiwanese people. Now, if we want to eliminate the remaining poison, the education problem is very important. However, in the past, Japan restricted Taiwanese people from entering normal schools, so there is a severe shortage of teachers, especially teachers for secondary schools and above. It is hoped that compatriots in the country will go to Taiwan to serve in education. Second, the problem of restoring transportation and production. In the past, transportation on Taiwan Island and between the island and the outside world was very developed. During the war, water and land transportation tools suffered heavy losses and damage. In addition to the destruction of some production enterprises, they were all in the hands of the Japanese in the past. Now that most of the Japanese have been sent back to their country, there is a great shortage of talent. It is still not enough to rely on Taiwan Province's own strength now. It is hoped that domestic experts, industrialists, and overseas Chinese will jointly assist, and the central authorities should also give special support to facilitate early recovery. In short, Taiwan has fertile land, abundant products, and a foundation laid by the Japanese. As long as we work hard, it is easy to revive and prosper. It is hoped that compatriots will turn their attention to Taiwan and jointly plan the construction and prosperity of a new Taiwan.</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Actively Promotes Prohibition of Opium While Simultaneously Commencing Rural Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Zhu Shaotong Delivers Speech Before Departing Beijing for Hangzhou</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Zhu Shaozhou, Chairman of Shaanxi, went to his hometown of Hangzhou on the 12th to sweep tombs and will return to Shaanxi after staying for one or two days. According to him: (1) The more difficult aspect of Shaanxi's administration at present is the issue of opium prohibition, as the Japanese openly cultivated it in the past. However, opium prohibition is now being actively promoted. (2) Public opinion and social customs are trending in the right direction. (3) Prices are normal, and sugar prices are stable. It was originally planned that there would be a bumper harvest this autumn, but there has been a lot of rain in the past month, so there is only a 60% hope. (4) A rural reconstruction plan is being formulated to stabilize the lives of farmers. It has now been decided to start with water conservancy, increase production, select seeds, improve agricultural tools, and improve soil quality. It also advocates rural cooperation to support self-cultivating farmers, overthrow those who do not work for a living, and release cotton goods (3 billion this year) and agricultural loans (500 million for planting this year) to overthrow high-interest goods. (5) Regarding the results of this conference, he said: At present, all methods still boil down to "taking" from the people, and have not achieved "giving". Giving means enabling them to produce more, and then taking from the people. If those who produce are few, the people will be rich. However, this conference has made the financial and food aspects also problematic and has enabled top-down penetration. Once the truth is clear, gaps can be avoided. Mr. Zhu flew to his hometown of Hangzhou on the 12th to sweep tombs and will leave Hangzhou and return to Shaanxi after one or two days.</p>
<h3>Massacre in Tangkilong: China Protests to the Netherlands; Overseas Chinese in Batavia Unite to Close Markets in Mourning</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] More than 500 overseas Chinese were massacred in the Tangkilong area of Java. The Chinese authorities have protested to the Netherlands. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie notified the British Embassy here today to inform the Supreme Commander of Southeast Asia and request that he take emergency measures to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 11th] Overseas Chinese here today mourned the massacre in Tangkilong. Various agencies of the Indonesian government lowered flags to half-mast, and some Dutch agencies also lowered flags to half-mast in mourning. The reporter drove around the usually bustling Chinatown area today, but saw a scene of silence. All overseas Chinese schools, hotels, newspapers, factories, and some Indonesian shops were closed. Doctors also stopped seeing patients. The famous New Market (Xin Shichang) and the Glodok Market were deserted. This "silent protest" was launched by the Chinese General Association. No incidents occurred during this period.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 11th] It has been learned here that Dutch troops have rescued 2,500 Chinese in the Tangkilong area where overseas Chinese were murdered, including hundreds of women and children.

<h3>Kunming's Money Supply Eases</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Kunming, 11th] Kunming's money supply has been easing since the 10th. However, due to the impact of the tight monetary policy last week, a small number of banks still do not lend to non-factory businesses. Because there are many people withdrawing money from the "貨帮", some small banks are still tightening loans. There are more remittances to Shanghai and Chongqing. The Central Bank is now taking a coordinated approach to Shanghai remittances. Various banks and money houses can supply as much as needed based on actual needs. Kunming's capital has been trending towards gold since the 10th, and the price has risen from 228,000 to 235,000 yuan. Cotton yarn has risen with the price of gold. There are many fabrics that cannot be sold, and the price will fall. The supply of cigarettes exceeds demand, and the market is trending downward.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Communist Army's Idea of a Ceasefire is Just This!</h3>
<p>Ceasefire! Ceasefire! This is the appeal of the people, and also the expectation of friendly countries. A fifteen-day ceasefire! This is the order of the government, and even more so a method agreed to by the Communist Party. When the fifteen-day ceasefire took effect today, we sincerely appealed to both sides not to miss this opportunity again. However, the answer that reality has given us is too disappointing! The Communist Army's answer is the resumption of gunfire in the Northeast, the large-scale attacks within Shandong, and the full utilization of Japanese bandits and their weapons to attack the National Army, to seize cities, and to destroy transportation. How strange! The Communist Army's idea of a ceasefire is just this!</p>
<p>However, there is no need to be surprised. The Communist Army's idea of a ceasefire is still an old trick of the Communist Party. We have said long ago that there must be credibility before negotiations can take place, and negotiations can only have value. Now, we are talking again and again, fighting while talking, and talking while fighting. What is the use of negotiations? If the Communist Army always wants to use negotiations as a period of rest for attacks, or as a cover for surprise attacks, then there is no such thing as a ceasefire at all. Under the supreme decision-making of the Chinese Communist Party, the Communist Army's actions are always the same, seemingly with the sole purpose of preventing China from becoming strong under a unified national government. Therefore, even enemies can be used, and enemy weapons can be used as well, as long as they can cause trouble for the National Government, prevent the National Government from smoothly taking over the Northeast, and prevent the National Government from restoring national transportation, thereby preventing the people from obtaining the basic conditions for a peaceful and prosperous life. The Communist Army can do anything. In other words, the Communist Army's fierce attacks on Lafa and its encroachment on Yongji in the Northeast these past few days, and its capture of Dezhou and its fierce attacks on Tai'an, Jiaoxian, Weixian, Gaomi, and other places in Shandong, even with the appearance of attacking Jinan, Qingdao, and Xuzhou, all show that the Communist Army is simply not only not ceasing fire, but is also taking a road that is the opposite of a ceasefire, and is intensifying the fighting and expanding the war zone every day.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Communist Army's representative in Changchun, Rao Shushi, blindly announced that he had not received a ceasefire order, believing that the violation of the ceasefire agreement was not the fault of the Northeast Communist Army. On the other hand, Zhou Enlai flew from Yan'an to Nanjing to visit General Marshall, visiting this party today and making appointments with that faction tomorrow, making it seem as if the Communist Party alone eagerly hoped for peace, in an attempt to confuse the eyes and ears of the world. Some minority politicians who claim to be neutral have also completely forgotten the position of the people, disregarded the suffering of the people, and especially abandoned justice and fairness. They only know how to follow behind the Communist Party and shout for a ceasefire and peace, but they do not know that the ceasefire and peace they are shouting for have long been kicked to the clouds by the Communist Party, the Communist Army, and the remnants of Japanese bandits protected by the Communist Army. To be honest, the Communist Army's idea of a ceasefire will not deceive a truly discerning ordinary person. At this time, our ordinary people have a simplest view, which is that during the fifteen-day ceasefire period, whichever side starts fighting first is a public enemy of the people and a sinner of the country!</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we are willing to make another heartfelt appeal on behalf of the truly ordinary people in the position of journalists:</p>
<p>First, we will first rebuke the wise, so we still earnestly request the government to strictly order the National Army in various places to strictly abide by the ceasefire agreement and the ceasefire order. Even if the Communist Army challenges every day and attacks everywhere, the National Army, in order to protect the people and defend the local area, cannot but counterattack. However, this counteroffensive should absolutely be limited to defending the original defensive line, so that Chinese and foreigners can understand who started the trouble, and so that the final mediation directed by General Marshall can still have a chance to proceed.</p>
<p>Second, based on the principle of "treating people with kindness," we still hope that the Communist Party can pull back from the brink. At this time, the Communist Party should recognize that its mission of the era is to promote China's unification and strength, rather than to create division and separation, thereby weakening China's strength. The Communist Party should know that this fifteen-day ceasefire is indeed the only good opportunity for the Communist Party to change its style. If the Communist Party still obstructs the unified takeover of the Northeast at this time, or even uses force to seize cities such as Jinan, Qingdao, and Xuzhou, our ordinary people will only recognize that the Communist Army is a group of bandits who are deliberately rebelling, and can no longer regard them as some kind of army with which the government can still negotiate.</p>
<p>Third, we believe that all negotiations between the government and the CCP must be conducted in an atmosphere of complete ceasefire, and during the process, the opinions of a third-party arbitrator must be respected. This so-called third party is definitely not a small number of politicians posing as democrats, but should be the objective and detached General Marshall, and especially the Chinese ordinary people who are suffering from the war. We believe that in order for future negotiations to be effective and powerful, it is necessary to first grant General Marshall the power of arbitration, and when necessary, the National Political Consultative Conference and the provincial and municipal councils should elect representatives of the truly ordinary people to form a supreme arbitration committee to make a final judgment on the disputes between the government and the CCP. Whoever obeys this judgment, the ordinary people will support; whoever opposes this judgment, the ordinary people will rise up and attack. We believe that during the period when the government and the CCP have disputes, there is only one way to achieve peace in the country, which is to respect the arbitration power of the people and General Marshall. Whichever side opposes or disregards the arbitration power of the people is undemocratic, which is also a sign that it does not want peace. The people will eventually have a way to deal with these anti-democratic and anti-peace rescuers!</p>
<h3>Local Correspondences Wuhu</h3>
<p>#### Central Government Agencies' Grade Six Treatment Personnel Consistently Work Slowly</p>
<p>Protesting the Inequity of Regional Adjustments to Treatment High and Local Courts Handle Appeals as Usual</p>
<p>[Our Wuhu Correspondent] Since the announcement of the Measures for Regional Adjustments to the Treatment of Public Servants and Teachers, all personnel in central government agencies in Wuhu, except for state-owned enterprises and special institutions such as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Postal Administration, the Relief Administration Branch, and the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, believe that since the victory, the prices of all goods in Wuhu have not only exceeded those in the Beijing-Shanghai area but are also the highest in the country. However, Wuhu has been ranked as Grade Six, with a basic amount of 35,000 yuan and a multiplier of 180, which is only half that of the Beijing-Shanghai area. This not only makes it impossible to maintain a livelihood but is also greatly unfair. Therefore, the entire staff of the Sanitary Brigade, the Commodity Tax Bureau, the Direct Tax Bureau, the Salt Administration, the Local Court, and the Third Branch of the High Court held a meeting at the Third Branch of the High Court at 10:00 AM on the 10th. They also invited the press. President Wang of the High Court, Chief Sheng, and Brigade Commander Xiang reported the opinions of all personnel in succession. They expressed sympathy for the attitude of public servants and teachers in Hangzhou who resigned. After discussion, and after the strenuous persuasion of their respective supervisors, they unanimously decided to initially work slowly while awaiting a solution. During the period of slow work, in order to take into account the interests of the people, the High and Local Courts will continue to handle scheduled and appealed cases as usual.</p>

<p>Convictions for Adultery and Husband's Murder</p>
<p>The case of Shen Zou, wife of the late Shen You-sheng, of Chen Jia Hang, Dongxiang County, who conspired to murder her husband, has been clearly investigated by the court prosecutor's office. The case arose from Zou's adultery with Hu Yun-lin, who suffocated Shen You-sheng with hemp rope. However, Hu Yun-lin was the first to act, and Zou assisted at the scene. A public prosecution was immediately filed, and the court rendered its verdict on the 10th of this month. Hu Yun-lin was sentenced to death for intentional homicide, and Shen Zou was sentenced to seven years in prison for assisting in homicide.</p>

<p>Rental Dispute Resolved Through Mediation</p>
<p>The issue of rents in this town has been dragging on until now and has never been resolved. It is now learned that the party and government agencies convened a mediation meeting on the 10th. After discussion, it was decided that the rent amount in 1937 would still be used as the standard. Storefronts will increase by 700 times per yuan (for example, 10 yuan before the war is now 7,000 yuan). Residences will increase by 500 times per yuan (for example, 10 yuan before the war is now 5,000 yuan). The validity period is limited to six months (from May to October). Thus, the long-standing rental issue has been temporarily resolved.</p>

<h3>Before the Reopening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference Bevin Makes Important Statements If the Conference Fails, He Will Act Alone Primarily Place the Ruhr Area Under International Management</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 12th (Radio): British Foreign Secretary Bevin expressed his opinion at the Labor Party annual conference, saying: If the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference still fails, he intends to sign peace treaties separately with the former Axis countries and their European satellite states.</p>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 12th (Radio): British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech at the Labor Party annual conference today, refuting the criticisms of the opposition. He made important statements on the issues of Palestine, the Soviet Union, and Spain: (1) Regarding the Palestine issue, he does not want 100,000 Jews to enter the region, because if this is done, British troops will need to station one more division in that area. (2) Regarding the Soviet Union, his wording was even stronger. Bevin listed his past friendly actions towards the Soviet Union, but today he knows that the Soviet Union has forgotten these favors. He pointed out that the Soviet newspapers recently did not mention a single word about his diplomatic speech. Everything must come from the sincerity of both parties, but the Soviet Union is like this, so what else can be said. (3) Regarding Spain, Bevin believes that if other countries do not interfere in Spain's internal affairs, Franco may have already fallen. Bevin does not advocate economic sanctions against Spain, because the victims are only the Spanish civilians.</p>
<p>Bevin also commented on the German issue. He said: France's demand to divide the Ruhr is understandable, because France has been invaded by Germany three times, and in order to ensure its own safety, it has to take this measure. However, according to Bevin's opinion, the Ruhr industrial area should be placed under international management, because this will not only benefit the 6.6 million people in the area, but will also ultimately benefit all European countries.</p>
<p>Bevin welcomed the United States' proposal for the four powers to conclude a 25-year mutual assistance treaty to monitor Germany's disarmament. He said: Some people believe that we are trying to establish a Western bloc, but in fact, the Eastern bloc already exists. However, Bevin does not advocate adopting this approach, which will create barriers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] The representatives of the four foreign ministers recently continued their meeting and decided that the items of the Italian peace treaty that have been agreed upon should be drafted immediately.

Regarding the German issue, the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are also exchanging opinions. It is expected that the Austrian issue will be submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference by US Secretary of State Byrnes. The German issue will be submitted by British Foreign Secretary Bevin.</p>

The tasks and powers of the committee will be subject to the control of subsequent executive orders. Regarding the matter of 100,000 Jewish immigrants to Palestine, President Truman had direct correspondence with Prime Minister Attlee to exchange opinions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] The possibility of the United States using its military to support its Jewish immigration policy to Palestine has been discovered today. According to Secretary of State Byrnes, the United States is prepared to discuss with the United Kingdom how many troops the United States needs to protect the order of Palestine when Jewish immigration expands. Byrnes said that the United Kingdom's request for US military assistance did not mention the number of troops required. Byrnes refused to express an opinion on whether the United States is willing to send troops to Palestine. Byrnes' statement was issued immediately after President Truman advocated the establishment of a Palestine Committee by the cabinet. Byrnes is the chairman of the committee.</p>
<p>Britain Asks the US Six Questions</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] US Secretary of State Byrnes stated on the 11th that the six inquiries made by the United Kingdom regarding the implementation of the Palestine report recommendations have now been submitted by US Ambassador to the United Kingdom Harriman to the newly appointed cabinet committee for organization and research. Although Byrnes did not have accurate information, he believed that after the United Kingdom received satisfactory answers to the six inquiries, it would implement the recommendation to allow 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine. The six inquiries made by the United Kingdom are as follows: (1) If chaos occurs in Palestine due to immigration, what assistance will the United States provide to quell it? (2) How will each homeless Jew in Europe be selected and allowed to move to Palestine? (3) How can transport ships be obtained? (4) Who will provide the transport ships? (5) How will the immigration expenses be handled? (6) How will the materials for temporary housing for new immigrants be supplied?</p>

<h3>Umberto Reluctant to Give Up Throne Italian Political Situation Serious If Not Resolved, It Will Lead to Civil War</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 12th] The Italian cabinet has held five consecutive meetings in 30 hours, but has not yet decided on the national system. It has also failed to persuade King Umberto to abdicate. Moreover, the pro-monarchy demonstrations in Naples caused a bloody incident in which seven people died, which shocked the cabinet. Today, it is considering immediately convening a constitutional conference to resolve whether the country should become a republic or a monarchy. It is rumored that some police in Naples have joined the pro-monarchy and pro-republic police in fighting.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 11th] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi announced that June 11 is the anniversary of the birth of the Italian Republic. However, Umberto is still reluctant to give up the throne and is unwilling to give up. The overall situation of the country is in danger. The seriousness of the situation is no different from when the Fascist Party attacked Rome 30 years ago. Naples has already had disturbances. The whole country seems to be wavering between monarchy and republic, and the situation is very uneasy. The military and police are on strict alert to prevent chaos. The government declares that the victory of republicanism will never be seized by others. However, the spokesman for the Royal Party accused the election of being illegal and strongly stated that Umberto is unwilling to leave the country until the Supreme Court officially announces his defeat. A stalemate has now been formed between Umberto and the De Gasperi cabinet over whether Italy is a republic.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 11th] Although the royal flag is still flying high in the palace today, the army ________, as if the king has left the palace.</p>
<p>Four Hours of Riots in Naples</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Naples, 11th] Thousands of pro-monarchy people recently attacked the Italian Communist Party headquarters, and a conflict immediately occurred, resulting in four deaths and 30 injuries.

The pro-monarchy people also attacked the police and set fire to the tanks. The riots lasted for a total of four hours. A girl was crushed to death by a tank. Allied military police did not intervene.</p>
<p>[United Press, Naples, 11th] After fighting fiercely with the police for two hours tonight, pro-monarchist crowds surged to the Communist Party headquarters, each holding bottles of kerosene with lit wicks, making so-called "Molotov cocktails," attempting to set the Communist Party's house on fire. A United Press reporter witnessed the unfolding of the incident from the window of the three-story police station near the Communist Party headquarters and believes that this is the most serious conflict in a week of tension between monarchists and republicans in this city.</p>

<h3>Words of the Atomic Bomb Inventor: Establish a World Government to Avoid Global Destruction; Atomic Bomb Should be Controlled by International Body</h3>
<p>[United Press, Los Angeles, 12th] Dr. Szilard of the University of Chicago, one of the personnel involved in the invention of the atomic bomb, stated today at the Southern California Atomic Information Committee: Now that new discoveries have been made regarding the atom, and the possibility of biological warfare is even greater, the only way to avoid global destruction is to establish a world government. If airplanes, cannons, and tanks remain the primary weapons of war, then the United States, with its vast production capacity, can still maintain a strong position. However, with the existence of the atomic bomb, the situation has completely changed. The United States may produce more atomic bombs than other countries, but once we have enough atomic bombs to destroy all the cities of an enemy nation, producing more will be of little benefit to us. The question becomes: Who has more cities that are easily destroyed? Sixty million people in the United States live in large metropolitan areas. If we want to make the United States less vulnerable to attack, these people must relocate elsewhere, which could be completed within ten years at a cost of $200 billion. Many people believe that the United Nations may have a good chance of preventing war, but no one believes that the organization has made war impossible. Only a world government is a clear answer. If people intend to organize a world government, they must consider the welfare of all mankind. In the next two or three years, various international organizations should be established. The first should control atomic energy, and others should restore living standards, assist with economic issues, handle monetary situations, and redistribute scarce resources.</p>
<h3>Shocking News: One Ounce of Bacteria Powder Can Poison Two Hundred Million People</h3>

<h3>Ten Thousand Atomic Bombs Can Destroy All of America</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th, United Press] Thomas, one of the leaders engaged in atomic energy research, stated during a speech: Atomic bombs with far greater power than those previously made can now be produced in quantities of thousands. If ten thousand of these powerful atomic bombs are launched via unmanned aircraft and rockets, the entire United States could be destroyed in a matter of minutes. He, who has received the Atomic Bomb Research Medal, said during a discussion of the power of atomic energy: All nations must realize the existence of this common danger. We must work together to avoid mutual destruction.</p>

<h3>U.S. Navy Scheduled to Test V2 Rockets for Probing High-Altitude Ionosphere; Will Soar Straight Up to a Distance of One Hundred Miles</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 11th] On June 27th, the U.S. Navy will launch V-2 rockets equipped with scientific instruments at the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. At that time, the rockets will soar straight up one hundred miles, entering the high-altitude ionosphere, which no one has yet been able to explore. This experiment will be conducted in cooperation with Army Ordnance engineers, who will be responsible for launching and controlling the rockets. Rear Admiral Both, Director of the Navy Research and Invention Group, said when announcing the planned experiment: "The June 27th experiment will only be the first step in a vast research program to acquire scientific knowledge of the high altitude, which may open new horizons for mankind. According to the Navy Research and Invention Bureau's plan, V-2 rockets will be used to penetrate the upper atmosphere at least twice, as far as possible. Scientists hope that this V-2 experiment will enable them to obtain answers to some of the most difficult problems in the universe. They will use observations of cosmic rays to learn more facts about atoms and their constituent particles, electrons, positrons, and neutrons. Their testing of the high-altitude atmosphere will also benefit astronomers, who must see through this barrier when observing stars. Scientists will also gain more new knowledge about the electron clouds in the high-altitude atmosphere of the earth, known as the ionosphere, which are closely related to short-wave radio communications. Most of the earth's energy is derived from the sun, so astronomers and physicists have been studying solar radiation for many years. Now, for the first time, they can observe radiation that is isolated by the atmosphere. It is believed that if this radiation could penetrate and reach the ground, all life on earth would be destroyed."</p>
<h3>Rocket Travel to Planets Could Be Realized Within Twenty Years</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Pasadena, California, 11th] Dr. Seifert, a scientist at the California Institute of Technology, said yesterday that rocket travel to planets may be realized within the next ten to twenty years. Dr. Seifert declared, "Planetary travel is indeed not a pie-in-the-sky dream." But he said that before achieving this goal, two major problems must be solved: First, how to produce an atomic energy unit that is light enough to be attached to a rocket; and second, how to build a strong combustion chamber that can accommodate the gas produced by atomic energy.</p>

<h3>Seems Like a Lot of Talk: Pan Sanxing Shows Off His Accomplishments, Claims to Have Assisted in the War of Resistance and Saved Comrades in Distress; Looks Pleased When Speaking of His Relationship with the Traitor Zhou</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) At 10:00 AM yesterday, the High Court opened the trial of Pan Sanxing on charges of being a traitor. Before the war, Pan was the representative of the German trading company Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co. stationed in Beijing. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Pan colluded with Ju Xun to reach Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, as well as enemy spies Chou Ye, Japanese rōnin Sasaki, and Nakamura, Umemoto, and Yamaguchi of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Japanese Camp, organizing the Shanghai Shipping Company, taking on the role of manager. He also joined the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company, an enemy-controlled entity, as an inspector. He further organized the Gold Industry Joint Exchange Association, disrupting finance, and another Cotton Industry Joint Exchange Association, specializing in speculation. Later, he founded the Trading Bank, promoting the dark market for pseudo-currency Zhongchu Banknotes. He also frequently gathered crowds to frequent the Asia General Association and other large gambling dens, and organized the "Three Provinces Football Team" to participate in the ball game donation competitions organized by the pseudo-Shanghai Municipal Sports Association, donating more than three million pseudo-currency. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, he was prosecuted based on the Punishment of Traitors Regulations and the criminal law on gambling.</p>
<p>When the trial opened yesterday morning, Pan wore a grey long gown and black cloth shoes. His hair was neatly combed and shone brightly, his face was rosy, and he looked energetic, not like a prisoner. First, Judge Cao asked the defendant's age and place of origin, and then asked about Pan's property. He claimed that his only real estate was the residence at 201 Julu Road and the land at the intersection of Rue Lloyd and Niuzhuang Road. All stocks and personal property have been handed over to the Military Statistics Bureau. He also said that the Shanghai Shipping Company was organized by the Shanghai-Xixi Charity Association to rescue refugees from Wuxi. The "Lianyi Bank" was organized by the exchange, with a capital of two million yuan, each share worth twenty thousand pseudo-currency. The football team was organized to cover the activities of underground comrades. As for the ball game donation, Pan said during the investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office that he had tried to prevent the "plane donation movement," and Liu Yangshan from Nanjing even made a long-distance phone call to warn him, saying that the enemy constitution had noticed his actions and advised him to be careful. Therefore, he requested that Fu and Liu testify. Yesterday morning, Judge Cao summoned Liu Yangshan, who flatly denied it, saying that there was no such thing. Pan Sanxing immediately said: "Don't be timid, it doesn't matter if you say it!" Originally, Liu's indictment by the High Prosecutor's Office did not include membership on the Pseudo-Plane Donation Movement Committee, probably for fear of implicating him and increasing his sentence. Lawyer Zhou Yingcai used the "New China Handbook" as evidence to expose his secrets, but Liu still did not admit it. Judge Cao also asked Pan about his relationship with Zhou Fohai. Pan said that he was a godson, and smiled as he spoke. Later, the defendant's lawyers Zhou Yingcai, Li Mo, and Tang Ying presented six pieces of physical evidence. Finally, Pan still stated two points: (1) He assisted in the War of Resistance against Japan, contacted Ji Xizong, a specialist of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Executive Committee, provided intelligence, excluded underground workers, and rescued comrades in distress. He was even imprisoned by the enemy constitution and joined the Central Statistics Bureau in 1944, serving as a design committee member. (2) He assisted the Allied forces in combat, contacted Major Martin and Mr. Howard of the American Embassy, investigated the enemy's movements, provided favorable intelligence, and learned about the enemy's anti-aircraft firepower when Allied aircraft bombed Shanghai, that only two or three of their anti-aircraft guns could reach an altitude of 8,000 feet, and knew their deployment locations and the airport's takeoff and landing conditions. He told Martin, informing the American Air Force, so they could fly low to fight, increasing the hit rate and avoiding the deaths of many of our people. Witnesses Martin and Ji Xizong were both present in court, but due to lack of time, they were not summoned, and the court ordered a rescheduling of the trial.</p>
<h3>Four Cases Concluded Yesterday</h3>

<p>In early 1944, more than 150 youths from the city, inspired by the call of "100,000 Youths for 100,000 Soldiers," under the leadership of the Youth League of the City Party Headquarters, braved the dangers, crossed the enemy blockade line, and traveled to Tunxi, southern Anhui, to gather and join the intellectual youths in the military. They were then assigned to the 208th Division of the Youth Army for training. The total number of people who passed the examination was 134, who were organized into a company. After demobilization, except for a small part who remained in the camp to work, all 95 volunteer youth soldiers from the Shanghai Company, together with the third batch of demobilized Youth Army mixed brigade, arrived in Shanghai North Station on a special train from Hangzhou at 1:30 PM yesterday. Those who welcomed them at the North Station included Wu Shaohui, chairman of the Party Headquarters, and more than 3,000 people from various agencies, schools, and organizations. The City Government Band and the Guangxia Middle School Scout Band played music to welcome them at the station. When the train arrived at the North Station at 1:30 PM, the Shanghai Company was in the seventh section of the train. Outside the train, the seventeen large characters "Greetings to the Elders of All Circles in the City from the Shanghai Military Youth" were written. Amidst the sounds of military music and firecrackers, Xiong Zeguang, the captain of the Shanghai Company, led the first to disembark and gather. Chairman Wu, Wang Xiaolai, and others immediately stepped forward to express their condolences to the Shanghai military youth who had won honor for Shanghai. The Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League sent Miss Dai Kaizhu, Miss Lu Wenmei, and Miss Zhu Lanchi to present flowers to the Shanghai Company Youth Army, which were accepted by Mr. Qin Tingyao. Then, the team marched out of the station, and the students of various schools who were lined up to greet them sang the "Welcome Soldiers" song to show their welcome. After the Shanghai troops departed, the mixed brigade re-formed the team and disembarked, with a total of more than 1,800 people arriving in Shanghai yesterday, including the Fujian Brigade of the 209th Division, the Xiamen Battalion, one company of the Wenzhou Independent Company, one team of the Guangdong Company of the 208th Division, one team of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Company, and one team of the Shanghai Company, led by Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Xianzhang. After disembarking, the Student Union sent Miss Wang Jiazhu, Miss Yan Yunhong, and Miss Pan Zhian to present flowers to the entire Youth Army of the mixed brigade, which were accepted by Mr. Hu Baoquan and Mr. Chen Youxi. Then, the team marched to the Fuyuan Warehouse on Guangfu Road and the Zhongziwan Zhong Company for rest. The demobilized youth soldiers of the Shanghai Company were invited by the Youth League to stay at the Youth Hall on Haig Road.</p>
<p>Embarking on a Journey</p>
<p>In addition, the Fujian Battalion that arrived in Shanghai on the 10th embarked on the "Mingxing" and "Zhoushan" ships at Wharf No. 13 on the Bund yesterday to return to Fujian. The "Mingxing" is scheduled to set sail this morning, and the "Zhoushan" is scheduled to set sail on the morning of the 14th. The Xiamen Battalion that arrived in Shanghai yesterday will also reportedly take the "Zhoushan" back to Fujian. In addition, the Guangdong Brigade that arrived in Shanghai on the 11th was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the Liberty Ship this afternoon, but due to lack of time, it may be delayed by one day and travel with the Guangdong Company and the Overseas Chinese Team that arrived in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Welcome Guangdong Team: A Grand Event Yesterday</h3>
<p>The second batch of demobilized Youth Army, the Guangdong Brigade of 2,300 people, arrived in Shanghai at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday. All sectors of the city held a grand "Shanghai Municipal All Circles Welcome the Youth Army Demobilization Conference" at the Municipal Gymnasium yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. The Youth Army 209th Division Deputy Division Commander Gu Rongjun, Demobilized Youth Army Guangdong Brigade Commander Tu Chengqing, and more than 2,000 officers and soldiers, and representatives from all walks of life, including Wu Shaohui, chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Cao Jun of the Youth Army Demobilization Committee, Mrs. Li Hanhun, former chairman of Guangdong Province, and now a member of the Central Party Headquarters, Ms. Wu Jufang, and Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, attended. Chairman Wu and Mrs. Li delivered speeches to encourage the troops. Miss Wang Jiazhu, a student from Zhengxing Girls' Middle School, presented flowers on behalf of the students. Finally, artistic performances were performed, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Gated North and South Shanghai: Building Houses; Municipal Government Cracks Down on Occupation of Private Land</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The Municipal Government authorities, in view of the serious housing shortage, are providing construction convenience for residents in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas to build houses. However, if some citizens illegally occupy private land and do not apply for licenses from the Construction Office of the Municipal Engineering Bureau, the bureau will strictly crack down on them in conjunction with the Construction Police Bureau. If landowners discover such situations, they can also file complaints with the office and demand that the occupants demolish the houses. On the other hand, the Engineering Bureau requests the Land Administration Bureau to requisition citizens' open spaces for housing construction. In addition, the construction of thatched houses, which pose a safety hazard, is also subject to crackdown.</p>
<h3>The Biggest Difficulty Currently Is Still the Economic Problem</h3>
<p>The deepest impression Mr. Chu Huiseng (Fucheng) gave me was of solemnity, integrity, and meticulousness, never saying a redundant word or using a vague word—I have never seen a person who paid such attention to "accuracy" when speaking.</p>
<p>He sat upright, his long beard gradually turning white. Behind the seat was a bottle of extremely beautiful fresh flowers. The room was silent, only the slow and clear voice of Mr. Chu could be heard. He is already 74 years old this year. However, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, he still devoted himself to national affairs in the rear, working hard! He said, "For eight years, my body has been fine, but since last year, it seems to be a little worse."</p>
<p>Regarding the political situation, he said that there was no point in being pessimistic or optimistic. The biggest difficulty at present is still the economic problem. Foreign goods are being imported in a steady stream, and domestic industries have no way out. The situation is really dangerous.</p>
<p>After the victory, two types of people deepened the extravagance of Shanghai. The first group of people who returned to Shanghai included many who made fortunes from the national crisis in the inland. They brought money to Shanghai and still hoarded and speculated, disrupting the market. These were the first people to make Shanghai's atmosphere worse. The second type of person was a group of unscrupulous receiving personnel. Old Mr. Chu said angrily, "What they are doing is not receiving, it's simply stealing things!"</p>
<p>He told me that recently, the Political Council, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Central Supervisory Committee have jointly formed an investigation team to specifically investigate the receiving work. If evidence of corruption is found, it will be handed over to the court for strict punishment. He hopes that the people can assist in reporting.</p>
<p>He said with emotion, "Shanghai was originally a place where people from all over gathered, and with the addition of these two types of people to fuel the flames, it has been reduced to this state. Today, it is no longer possible for one or two people to set an example to reverse the decline!"</p>
<p>I walked into the rain with a heavy heart and squeezed onto a tram full of men and women. Shanghai was still so noisy, but it seemed that I had just heard the morning bells and evening drums from afar. In the crowd, I suddenly felt lonely.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Cholera Patients Broke This Year's Record</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) At 3:00 PM yesterday, Director of the Health Bureau Zhang Wei convened the first bureau affairs meeting since taking office, meticulously reviewing past work and future reforms. It was also decided to hold an enlarged epidemic prevention meeting at the New Life Club at 2:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>According to an investigation by the Health Bureau, the number of cholera patients yesterday reached 26, a total of 157, breaking the highest daily record for patients this year, which is truly alarming. The Health Bureau is once again appealing to all sectors to urge citizens to get vaccinated as soon as possible! Any schools or organizations should send letters directly to the Municipal Health Bureau, which will immediately send staff to vaccinate them.</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Postpones Trip to Beijing Due to Illness</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) After arriving in Shanghai, Wang Chonghui was originally scheduled to return to Beijing yesterday, but he suddenly fell ill the day before yesterday afternoon. After medical diagnosis, it was said that it was still caused by the old illness of high blood pressure. Injections were given immediately and he was told to rest. Therefore, the date of the trip to Beijing will be postponed. When returning to the capital, both Wang and Feng Yuxiang originally planned to fly to Beijing, but because both of them suffered from high blood pressure, they took the waterway to the east. It is said that Wang's illness is quite serious this time. Doctors visited Wang's residence in the mornings and afternoons for the past two days to provide medical care.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Hosts Business and Financial Circles Today</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi is scheduled to host business and financial circles at the Central Bank Club at 6:00 PM this afternoon to discuss issues related to developing international trade and supporting industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>Memorial for Du Chongyuan</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of Du Chongyuan's death in Xinjiang. Du's surviving family members arrived in Shanghai after the victory and chose to live at No. 1881 Linsen West Road. Du's surviving family members and his friends are scheduled to hold a memorial service for Du today.</p>
<h3>Non-Judicial Torture: Japanese War Criminal Haruki Yonemura on Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Yesterday morning, the First Pacification Area Military Tribunal again interrogated a case involving a Japanese war criminal. The accused, Haruki Yonemura, was the former captain of the Changshu Military Police. In July of the thirty-second year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], he led his subordinates in Taicang to search and arrest over fifty patriotic Chinese people, including Lu Xiaoyun. Apart from releasing thirty-odd of them, the rest were detained for over half a year. Various forms of torture were used to coerce confessions, resulting in the deaths of five people, including Hu Yucang, in prison. Later, Yonemura falsely accused Lu Xiaoyun and seventeen others, and had them sent to the Japanese military headquarters in Shanghai to be executed. After the victory [of the war], he was arrested by the Third War Area Army. Yesterday morning, during interrogation by Judge Lu Qi, the accused's testimony was evasive, and he denied the non-judicial torture alleged in the indictment. The court ordered a postponement for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Civil Servant Salary Adjustments: Municipal Government Finances More Strained</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Deputy Director Hu of the Municipal Finance Bureau stated: Salary adjustments for civil servants will be implemented by the municipal government starting this month. However, this will inevitably strain the municipal government's finances further, as the Executive Yuan only covers the salaries of 3,000 employees, while the municipal government has a total of 36,000 personnel. Financial expenditures will be impossible to cover.</p>
<h3>Civil Defense Corps to Be Abolished: Currently Undergoing Closure; Rong Youlue Offers Some Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Rumors circulated that the Municipal Civil Defense Corps would be abolished. Yesterday, this reporter made a special visit to Corps Commander Rong Youlue, who stated: To streamline organizations and unify command, the authorities plan to abolish the Corps. The closure is currently underway and is expected to be finalized by the end of this month. As a military man, I have found it particularly difficult to handle affairs since taking office due to financial difficulties. After the abolition, I may return to the military. However, I have two points I would like to bring to the attention of the public: First, since the Civil Defense Corps was established, there has been much misunderstanding from the outside world, with many believing it has achieved nothing. In fact, the members of this Corps are all local citizens, spread throughout every corner [of the city]. Their power to assist the military police and prevent [minor incidents] is undeniable. However, precisely because its effect lies in active prevention, there are few concrete facts to show for it. After the abolition, with military and police forces prevalent in the urban area, there should be no impact on public security. However, in the suburbs, there will be a feeling of a weak police presence. I hope the authorities will pay attention to this and that citizens will continue to provide assistance. Second, after the abolition of the Corps, hundreds of officers will be unable to find placement. They are all military academy students from various places. Although they will be given severance pay and travel expenses, their livelihood will inevitably be difficult to maintain under the current high prices. I hope the authorities can find a way to help them.</p>
<h3>New Telephone Directory to Be Printed and Distributed by the End of the Year</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The Shanghai Telephone Company plans to compile and print a new telephone directory. Once the paper arrives in Shanghai, it can be printed and distributed by the end of this year. The company also stated that since the price increase for telephone calls, the number of calls has decreased, and work efficiency has improved significantly. However, they hope that users will still conserve telephone usage as much as possible. As for new telephone equipment, the United States itself is experiencing shortages. Although orders have been placed, it will take more than a year for them to be shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Settlement of Compensation for Crew Members Lost in the "Haitong" Vessel Disaster</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The families of the crew members lost on the Sanbei Company's "Haitong" vessel demanded compensation. After days of negotiations, it is reported that labor and management reached an agreement yesterday. In addition to compensation according to maritime law, an additional year's compensation was agreed upon, with each person receiving 1.5 million yuan. The payment has already been made, totaling 55.5 million yuan for 37 people. A disturbance has finally been quelled.</p>
<h3>Appointment of Whiteley as Customs Commissioner: Customs Officers Request Reversal of Decision</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] All Chinese employees of the Jianghai Customs expressed their opposition to the appointment of the Englishman Whiteley as Customs Commissioner. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, they convened a meeting at the Customs Senior Club in Tongyi Lane, Nanjing Road, and resolved to issue a declaration, demanding that the government reverse its decision to appoint foreign customs officials.</p>
<h3>New Chen Police Officers Commended and Rewarded</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The Judicial Section of the New Chen Police Department has solved major cases one after another. A few days ago, Director Xuan specially awarded bonuses to encourage them. Former Section Chief Zhang Rou (who has now been transferred to the Taishan Branch) received 15,000 yuan, Section Members Gu Qiliu, Liu Zhufeng, and Wang Wenbin received 10,000 yuan each, and Sergeants Zhu Wanjun, Zhang Junfeng, Jiang Run, etc., received amounts ranging from 2,000 to 8,000 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Case Alleging Illegal Election: Debate Concluded, Awaiting Verdict</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The case in which lawyer Xia Gongkai and four others sued the Shanghai Municipal Government and its subordinate district offices, seeking confirmation that the election of Shanghai city councilors was invalid, was heard again yesterday morning in the Civil Division of the District Court. The plaintiffs' lawyers Yan Yuan'ao, Fang Zhong, and Lu Yunhai appeared in court. In addition to the lawyers Zhang Shijian and Qin Liankui representing the first defendant (the Municipal Government), the second defendant (the district offices) also hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Jiang Pingfan, Wang Shanxiang, Zuo Dexi, Feng Xizui, and Huang Ji to defend them. Only Xia Gongkai appeared for the plaintiffs. He withdrew the allegation of fraud but continued to insist on the allegation of illegality. Zhang Xiaosong and Li Xuexun, representatives of the statutory agents, appeared for the defendants. They presented counter-evidence to the plaintiffs' allegation of illegality. The debate then began and lasted for an hour. The defendants' lawyers argued that the plaintiffs' lawsuit had no legal basis, and that the presentation of evidence after the filing of the lawsuit showed that the plaintiffs were finding facts to support the lawsuit, rather than having facts first and then filing a lawsuit. Furthermore, since the plaintiffs knew that the defendants' election procedures were illegal, why did they not correct them within the previous three days, and only filed a lawsuit after losing the election? At 11:40 AM, the court ordered the debate to be concluded and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>Many Wrongdoings During the Enemy-Puppet Period: Still Living at Sea After the Victory; Chen Guangquan Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Chen Guangquan, a well-known gangster from Western Shanghai, 40 years old, residing at No. 12 Meifang Lane, Jiaozhou Road, colluded with Japanese spies Kawashima Yoshiko, Mitsuo Miyara and others during the enemy-puppet period. He served as the lieutenant general and adjutant of the puppet Peace Preservation Army, collecting intelligence for the enemy, harming patriotic people, oppressing the common people, and committing many wrongdoings. The Shanghai Command of the Third War Area Army Headquarters learned of this and dispatched personnel with the Putuo Road Police Station at around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday to the aforementioned location. Chen had not yet gotten up and was arrested. He was then taken back to the Shanghai Command Headquarters and escorted to the First Pacification Area Command in Wuxi that day for punishment.</p>
<h3>Hu Xiyuan Discusses the Electrical Appliance Industry: Prospects Not Optimistic; High Labor Costs, Heavy Costs; Unable to Withstand the Onslaught of Foreign Goods; American Electric Fans Arrive in Hong Kong at Low Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] As foreign goods flood in and our national industries teeter on the brink of bankruptcy, this reporter visited Hu Xiyuan, general manager of the Ya'pu'er Electrical Appliance Factory, yesterday to inquire about the current situation of the electrical appliance industry. He said that the industry is currently barely surviving, but the prospects are not optimistic. The General Electric Edison Bulb Factory, established by foreign merchants in Shanghai before the war, has been unable to resume production because its machinery was moved away by the Japanese during the Shanghai occupation. Furthermore, due to the unstable domestic political situation, foreign merchants are afraid to invest rashly. Therefore, domestic electrical appliances have not yet encountered a major enemy. Although the United States produces light bulbs and sells them for only one dime (US), which is equivalent to just over 200 yuan in our currency, transportation is not smooth, and the goods are not of great value, so they are not willing to import them in large quantities. Otherwise, compared with domestic light bulbs that cost 400 yuan to produce, how could they not be overwhelmed? However, American electric fans have arrived in Hong Kong, costing 80 Hong Kong dollars each, which is equivalent to 32,000 yuan in our currency. However, the current selling price of domestic electric fans in Shanghai is 140,000 yuan per unit. With such a comparison, the future is worrying. Therefore, domestic electrical appliances are fundamentally unable to be exported and can only seek development inland.</p>
<p>Speaking of the issue of workers' wages, Mr. Hu said: The reason why domestic goods were able to flourish and be exported in large quantities before the war was that our labor costs were low, our costs were light, and our selling prices were lower than those of foreign goods. However, the wages of our workers, calculated in currency, have now become the highest in the world. There are many irrational aspects of the current wage standards for workers. Although they are calculated according to the cost of living index, the base salary is much higher than before the war, making it difficult for general factories to bear.</p>
<p>Regarding the upcoming production conference, Mr. Hu's opinion is that in order to save the current industrial crisis, in addition to protective tariffs and other measures, the most important thing is cooperation between the government and the people, and cooperation between labor and capital; otherwise, they will all perish together.</p>
<h3>Construction of Tanggu New Port Actively Underway</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] According to Mr. Hou Jiayuan, head of the Executive Yuan Engineering Planning Group, the group's preliminary budget for the Tanggu Port construction plan is 2 billion yuan, which has been approved by Premier Song. Construction is now actively underway. Roughly within this year, the Dagu Dam lock will be passable. After that, ships sailing into the port will no longer have to wait for the tide there, and all the wharves in Dagu Port can also be gradually repaired for use. Furthermore, the road group of the group, consisting of Labour, White, Hart, Fang Fuson, Lu Xiaozhou, Wu Bizhi, and five others, has completed its mission of investigating the road conditions in the Northwest and Southwest areas since departing last month and flew to Shanghai from Chongqing yesterday. The railway group, consisting of Bowman, Gaona, Yuan Zhigang, and three others, departed two weeks ago to Hangzhou to investigate the conditions of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and has now arrived in Hankou. The port group has divided into two teams since arriving in Guangzhou. One team has set off for Hainan Island, Guangzhou Bay, Qinzhou, Beihai, and other places. The other team has set off for Shantou, Xiamen, and other places. They are all inspecting the conditions of the seaports in those places to plan the construction of seaports.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>We are informed by the concerned parties, Hua Shang Wei Lianshi Pharmacy Weiersheng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Wang Danqing, Xu Weigong, Yang Jiaquan, Xu Liangkun, and Cheng Meisheng, that they have read the article published in your newspaper on June 10 concerning the trademark infringement case in which Weiersheng lost the lawsuit. The article states: "According to the English-language 'Great American Evening Post' on June 6, the Jiangsu High Court has confirmed the Shanghai District Court's judgment in the lawsuit filed by Shanghai Wei Lianshi Physician's Pharmacy (i.e., British Wei Lianshi Physician's Pharmacy) against Weiersheng Pharmaceutical Factory for trademark infringement as reasonable (omitted below)." This does not correspond to the facts. It has been found that because the Shanghai District Court's judgment was improper, your esteemed lawyer and lawyers Tan Yigong and Tan Mingde were commissioned to appeal to the Shanghai High Court. After two court sessions by the Shanghai High Court (not the Jiangsu High Court), the original judgment of the first-instance court was completely changed. The two parties were ordered to reach a settlement in court, with Hua Shang Wei Lianshi Pharmacy voluntarily changing its trademark. British Wei Lianshi Physician's Pharmacy returned all the pharmaceutical machinery owned by Hua Shang Wei Lianshi Pharmacy and the affidavit signed by Xu Weigong under duress. There was no dispute over the business name. Hua Shang Wei Lianshi Pharmacy and others were by no means the losing party, and the appellant, British Wei Lianshi Physician's Pharmacy, was not represented by foreign lawyer Alman in court (foreign lawyers are not yet allowed to appear in court). It is clear that the English-language 'Great American Evening Post' made a factual error. In addition to waiting for the Shanghai High Court to deliver the settlement record before publishing an advertisement to clarify the truth, we have first commissioned your esteemed lawyer to send a letter to the newspaper to set the record straight. We hereby convey the facts accordingly and hope that you will investigate and show your public spirit. Lawyer Zhou Kun</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Presides Over Disaster Relief Affairs in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] This reporter recently interviewed Mr. Mo Dehui, who recently came to Shanghai, who stated: Mr. Zhang Xueliang's current living situation is quite comfortable. He is immersed in his studies and occasionally goes fishing. However, as he is approaching middle age (Mr. Zhang is 46 years old this year), his eyesight is gradually failing. In addition, he has been studying ancient books under oil lamps and now wears glasses. He also suffers from slight hearing loss due to a previous case of acute appendicitis. Regarding the situation in Northeast China, Mr. Mo said that the situation is complex, but currently eight of the nine provincial chairmen are from the Northeast, which should have a corresponding effect on local revenue. Mr. Mo did not express his opinion on the future of the Northeast. The Northeast has suffered 14 years of enemy devastation, and the people are still in dire straits. Therefore, Madame Chiang, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiyu, and others have specially initiated a charity performance for disaster relief in the Northeast, with Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Ma Lianliang, and others performing on the same stage, which is truly an unprecedented event in the Peking opera world. Mr. Mo's visit is to preside over this disaster relief effort. It is estimated that the income from the charity performance will reach over 100 million yuan. Yesterday, Mr. Xu Jiyu also paid a special visit to Mr. Mo's hotel and had a long and pleasant conversation.</p>

<h3>Chen Guangfu Returns from Overseas After an Eight-Year Absence from Shanghai: Discusses How American Materials Are Not Abundant After the War; Hopes That Our Future Economic Construction Will Progress</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, suddenly arrived in Shanghai yesterday from the United States on the "MacMurray Victory" after an eight-year absence from the city. As soon as he unpacked his luggage, this reporter rushed to his residence for an interview and was granted an audience. Mr. Chen was modest and had slightly graying temples. Although he described himself as being in ill health, his spirit was very good. He was dispatched in October of last year to represent the National Federation of Commercial Associations of our country to go to the United States to participate in the International Business Conference. After the conference adjourned, he spent most of his time in Boston recuperating, so he had little contact with various circles. This reporter asked about the recent economic attitude of the United States. He said: The current economic situation in the United States is transitioning from a wartime state to a peaceful stage. During this adjustment process, labor strikes have occurred repeatedly. For example, the National Maritime Union is currently brewing a strike, with rumors of an outbreak on June 15. However, the authorities have stated that they are confident that they can resolve it before then. Furthermore, American materials are not abundant after the war. Therefore, when our country purchases goods in large quantities from the United States, the United States still needs to consider its own supply and demand problems before issuing export permits. This is especially true for machinery, where the supply is even smaller. The reporter then asked about his expectations for our country's economy. He said: Our country finally achieved victory after many years of war, and we urgently hope that our future economic construction can enter a path of progress. Mr. Chen is currently 66 years old and is from Zhenjiang, Jiangsu. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States in his early years. After returning to China, he served at the Jiangsu Bank. On June 2, 1915, he and others, including Zhuang Dezhi, founded the Shanghai Bank. Mr. Chen served as the manager of the bank. At the time of its establishment, it was located at the current site of the Ningbo Road Yongda Bank. It had only one shop front with two bays, and the capital was only 100,000 yuan. Later, under Mr. Chen's meticulous planning, the bank's capital increased year by year. In 1919, the capital was increased to 1 million yuan. In July 1921, it was further increased to 2.5 million yuan. The current capital is 20 million yuan. The bank has been known for promoting small savings deposits. During the silver dollar rush in the financial community in 1931, the bank provided the convenience of unlimited withdrawal of silver dollar deposits to all depositors, and its reputation grew even stronger. In June 1931, the bank's new building on Ningbo Road was also completed, and its business grew by leaps and bounds. Currently, the total amount of deposits exceeds 20 billion yuan. There are as many as 41 branch offices and 1,500 employees throughout the country. In normal times, it uses talent only and strictly implements scientific management. Its excellent discipline and sound business have been praised throughout the country. The bank's associated business, the China Travel Service, provides services to travelers and develops traveler's checks, which are particularly convenient. In addition, there are also the First Credit and Dahua Insurance Companies. All of these were created by Mr. Chen, who spent half his life working hard. In peacetime, in addition to dedicating himself to financial affairs, Mr. Chen enjoys reading and researching and often browses Chinese and foreign books in his spare time. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Incident, Mr. Chen immediately went to the rear to assist the central government in planning various financial measures. He also repeatedly represented our country, traveling overseas to complete various important economic missions. His contributions were outstanding.</p>

<h3>Unexpected Tension in the Match, Eastern Star Fought Hard to Defeat the Jewish Team, The Dark Horse was Stubborn and Difficult to Subdue, Winning 5 to 3 with Great Effort, Eastern Star Recovered its Lineup and Overwhelmed its Strong Opponent in the Second Half</h3>
<p>The Eastern Star Expedition Football Team played against the Jewish team, known as the dark horse, at the Yiyuan Stadium at 5:30 PM yesterday. Before the match, fans predicted a one-sided victory for Eastern Star. Unexpectedly, the dark horse was stubborn and difficult to subdue, and Eastern Star almost fell. In the first half of yesterday's match, the score was tied at 2-2. Fortunately, Feng Jingxiang and Li Zhaorong of the Allied Forces entered the field in the second half, which allowed them to win 5-3, but it took a lot of effort. The audience was crowded yesterday, estimated at more than 10,000 people. The referee was Jiang Yinseng. The lineups of the two teams are listed below:</p>
<p>Eastern Star</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng</p>
<p>Huo Yaohua Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan Xu Jingcheng Guo Yingqi (out) Feng Kunsheng (in)</p>
<p>Li Shuoyou Liu Songsheng (in) Li Zhaorong (out) Guo Yingqi (in) Zhang Jinhai Feng Jingxiang (out) Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>Jewish</p>
<p>Analysis of Yesterday's Match</p>
<p>Yesterday's match between the Jewish team and the Eastern Star Allied Team was unexpectedly tense. Initially, it was thought it would be a one-sided affair, but it was not. Feng Jingxiang and Li Zhaorong, who were originally scheduled to rest, had to enter the field in the second half to suppress the Jewish team. Eastern Star then restored its original best lineup, but only won 3-1 in the second half, one of which was a penalty kick, which shows how fierce the competition was. The Jewish team's goalkeeping was too poor, some errors were inexplicable, otherwise the score might have been closer. The Jewish team's individual skills are not bad, but the forward cooperation is not as skilled and wonderful as Eastern Star's. This is where the visiting team's victory lies. Yesterday's match also had some elements of luck, with both sides having shots that were bound to score, but hit the goalpost and bounced back, just missing the net. Within the first five minutes of the second half, the two sides scored three goals each, gaining and losing in a inexplicable manner. In the last ten minutes, the Jewish team's attack was very fierce, but fortunately there were no mistakes. In short, the Jewish team played very well, but Eastern Star was not ideal, resulting in this situation.</p>
<p>Jewish Team Presented Flowers</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM, the whistle blew to start the match. The Jewish team manager De Foelis first presented flowers to the visiting team, and then Eastern Star took the lead with a favorable wind. The two sides were evenly matched. In the seventh minute, Li Shuoyou and Deng Guangsen flanked, and the ball moved like a shuttle. Liu Songsheng got an opportunity and shot fiercely from 25 yards away. The ball went into the net from the right corner, 1-0, Eastern Star opened the scoring first. The Jewish team launched a counterattack, but Huo and Hou's two defenders were well-fortified and there was no gap to exploit. In the eleventh minute, Oliveira came on and McKinley switched to the right inside forward, and Stanslund was temporarily substituted. The formation adjustment immediately showed improvement. Le Lia led the ball forward, and Feng Kunsheng committed a handball foul in the penalty area. Fan Fuxiao took the penalty, but failed to score. In the fifteenth minute, Songsheng received a pass from Shuoyou and knocked on the door in front of the enemy, but it was blocked by Wen Nuogan and failed. In the twenty-second minute, Liu and Guo advanced side by side, and Lisburg neglected his duties. Songsheng took the opportunity to enter and kicked the ball into the net from five or six yards away, 2-0, Eastern Star scored another goal. The Jewish team was not willing to give up. Oliveira advanced alone, and Fan Fuxiao touched the ball and passed it to Kopstein, who failed to score with the first attempt, but scored with the second, 2-1, the Jewish team pulled back a goal, and their morale was greatly boosted. In the twenty-seventh minute, the five forwards advanced together, and Xu Jingcheng failed to save in time. Hou and Huo tried their best to block, creating a dangerous situation. Less than three minutes later, McKinley came again, and Zhu Zhaoheng patted the ball into a corner kick. Stanslund re-entered the field to replace Que Lisi, and took the corner kick, which was just right. Fan Fuxiao shot fiercely with his thigh, and General Hou made a surprising save. As the first half was about to end, Feng Kunsheng committed another foul, and a penalty was awarded. Manya executed it and completed the mission, 2-2, and the two sides were evenly matched, ending the first half.</p>
<p>Urgently Called for Reinforcements</p>
<p>After the lemon break, Eastern Star saw that the situation was not good and urgently called in generals Li Zhaorong and Feng Jingxiang, and Liu Songsheng and Feng Kunsheng were substituted. Guo Yingqi returned to his original position as left midfielder, Zhang Jinhai moved to the center, and the Jewish team also used Xue Pandsiding to replace Que Lisiji. After the start of the second half, Eastern Star took the initiative and launched an offensive. In the third minute, Feng Jingxiang shot strongly, and Zhang Jinhai assisted and passed the ball into the net, 3-2, Eastern Star took the lead again. Less than three minutes later, Nas advanced alone, directly into the Eastern Star hinterland, and shot from 30 yards away. Zhaoheng got the ball but lost it again, and the Jewish team equalized again at 3-3. In the eighth minute, Li Shuoyou teamed up on the left and immediately returned the favor, 4-3, Eastern Star led for the third time. At this time, the Jewish team's five forwards were running and active, and the visiting team was almost busy parrying, so Xu Jingcheng retreated to the inner guard to assist in the defense. In the mixed battle, one minute before the end of the match, Manya fouled, and Feng Jingxiang took the penalty kick, which hit the bullseye, 5-3, Eastern Star's victory was established, and the time also ended.</p>

<h3>Why Should the "Art" Subject Be Restored in the Elementary School Curriculum Research Meeting?</h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of national construction, the Ministry of Education, under the premise of simplifying the curriculum and lacking teachers, discussed how to revise the elementary school curriculum standards. The "Art" subject was restored under my firm advocacy. After the meeting, I was not abandoned by my colleagues in the education field, and they inquired about the reasons for restoring the "Art" subject. I will answer as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Highest Ideal of Art Education</p>
<p>Why should elementary school students learn art? The reason is very simple, it is to use art to change their behavior, and it is definitely not to make them successful writers.</p>
<p>How can this goal be achieved? The first step is to make children enjoy beauty, using two methods simultaneously, namely (1) art appreciation, and (2) art creation. From such implementation, children can then apply these principles and methods of beauty to their daily lives to complete the beautification of life. As a result, behavior is changed. Richtwark once had the same proposition, and Cai Yuanpei's advocacy of "aesthetic education replacing religion" in the "May Fourth" era was also the same.</p>
<p>The "Drawing Subject" in the revised curriculum standard in the 31st year of the Republic was a kind of "knowledge and skill training." The "Art Subject" that is now being restored should be included in "moral conduct."</p>
<p>(2) The Problem of Children's Art Creation</p>
<p>Advocating the enjoyment of beauty does not completely deny the creation of beauty. However, how to develop its ability is an important issue.</p>
<p>Professor F. Cizek, the host of the Vienna Children's Art Class, has implemented a teaching method that can be said to be completely in line with the ideal of children's art creation. He set up a rich learning environment and used methods such as guidance and suggestion to skillfully develop children's creative abilities. Unlike our drawing curriculum standards in the 31st year of the Republic, which used methods such as "basic exercises" and "copying" to hinder children's free expression and free creation, it is indeed worth referring to. (Note 2)</p>
<p>Therefore, in the assignments of the "Art Subject," the teaching of "basic exercises" and "copying" must be absolutely abolished.</p>
<p>(3) After the Restoration of the "Art Subject"</p>
<p>Some people may worry that the revision of the curriculum is to "simplify," and the rich "Art" seems to be a problem compared to the simple "Drawing."</p>
<p>But the truth is not so. Forcibly demanding children to draw accurate "Drawings" is more in line with children's needs in terms of common sense judgment than taking enjoyment as a prerequisite, especially with absolutely free creation as the publishing assignment. From the perspective of interest principle, simple "Drawing" is more boring than rich "Art." "Children's painting is not based on training in any aspect." (Note 1)</p>
<p>His abstract knowledge, but based on what he directly sees in a natural attitude. Painters paint based on what they see with a special perspective; the painter's perspective requires learning knowledge and training to be possible. " (Note 3) This is a correct conclusion based purely on the study of children's painting psychology. Therefore, it does not violate the premise of simplifying the curriculum.</p>
<p>As for the lack of teachers, so using methods such as "copying," but, calmly think about it, there are probably not many teachers who can draw. Does that mean that the "Drawing Subject" can be cancelled, and the subject can be set up after the teachers are trained? That's a joke. Then, I think: the lack of teachers is indeed a big problem, but the material conditions needed are not solved one day, and having teachers is also a problem. (Wen Zhaotong, 35, 6, 12.)</p>

<h3>Davis Cup European Zone Semifinals, Yugoslavia Wins Over France, Bunes Defeats Bertra, France Fails to Achieve Success, Yugoslav Team Comes from Behind</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 11th] In the Davis Cup tennis European Zone semifinals, France and Yugoslavia were evenly matched. In the first day's competition, France won two singles matches, taking the lead. They were confident that they could eliminate Yugoslavia by winning another match. However, in yesterday's doubles match, the French team made inappropriate personnel adjustments, which allowed the Yugoslav team to win, making the score 2-1. There were two more singles matches today. If France could win one of them, they could still win. Unfortunately, both matches were lost. According to the first day's singles, French players Bertra and Benat played against Yugoslav players Mitic and Bunes. Each match was a five-set thriller. The Yugoslav players eventually lost due to unfamiliarity with the venue. In the second day's doubles match, the French team captain replaced Belichai and Testramo to allow the two players to rest. The Yugoslav team still fielded Bunes and Mitic. They were familiar with the venue and won the match. Two singles matches were held today. In the first match, Yugoslav Mitic defeated Benat. The general French audience was not pessimistic, believing that there was still hope of winning the last match. When Yugoslav Bunes and French Bertra took the field in the second match, the whole atmosphere became tense, as the key to victory or defeat was in this battle. Bertra, with the prestige of being the French national singles champion, would surely overwhelm his opponent. At the beginning of the match, Bunes was more calm and won the first set. However, Bertra immediately responded in kind. In the fourth set, the two sides were inseparable. Bertra won this set 9-7. In the fifth set, Bertra's leg cramped, and his movement was inconvenient. Unfortunately, he was defeated. The score was 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 7-9, 6-0. As a result of the three-day competition, Yugoslavia eliminated France 3-2 and entered the finals, where they will face the winner between Sweden and Belgium.</p>

<h3>Discussions on Governing the Yellow River (2)</h3>
<p>— Chu Tongan</p>
<p>(2) Research on Dam Location: The lower reaches of the Yellow River, besides the small tributaries of the Luo and Qin Rivers, have no other tributaries; the river flows north into Zhan and south into Huai. The Yellow River is simply a channel to the sea, carrying the water from its middle and upper reaches into the ocean. The water volume of the Yellow River, from Longmen upwards, receives the Fen River to the east and the Wei River to the west. The Wei River further receives the Jing and North Luo Rivers. The drainage area of these four rivers accounts for approximately half of the Yellow River's drainage area, and the water levels of these four rivers fluctuate unpredictably. Therefore, if a dam is built above Longmen, it will not be able to regulate the entire water volume of the Yellow River. Thus, the dam should be built below Tongguan. Below Tongguan, the Yellow River is blocked by the Xiaoshan Mountains to the south and the Zhongtiao Mountains to the north, until it passes the Xicheng and Mang Mountains and enters the plain. Within this area, there is a 300-li stretch of mountainous terrain, which is an ideal location for dam construction. In this area, with careful investigation, a suitable site for dam construction can surely be found. Failing that, if a suitable dam site cannot be found in this ideal location to regulate the entire Yellow River's water volume, then only a smaller dam needs to be built to regulate the water volume of the Fen, Wei, Jing, and North Luo Rivers. Another dam should be built in the mountainous area 700 li above Longmen to regulate the water volume of the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Such segmented regulation could also maintain a constant water volume in the Yellow River.</p>
<p>(3) Water Volume Regulation Method of the Dam and Utilization of the New Science of Meteorology: After the dam is completed, the water level can be raised by one to two hundred feet, thereby forming a long and narrow lake; this "artificial lake" is used to regulate water volume. Simultaneously with the completion of the dam, new-style meteorological stations should be established at suitable locations in the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Suiyuan, and Ningxia. Using the latest "high-altitude air mass analysis method," it is possible to predict weather changes six months or even several months in advance, and thus predict when a certain region will have heavy rainfall, and report it to the dam at any time. The dam can then release water stored in the "artificial lake" in advance based on these reports. When heavy rain comes and the river water rises sharply, the dam can discharge the appropriate amount of water to prevent endangering the downstream area, while storing the excess water in the "artificial lake." Then, the downstream area will not be threatened by sudden floods and levee breaches.</p>
<p>(4) Using Dredgers to Remove Sand from the Riverbed to Maintain a Certain Depth; and Using the Dredged Mud to Thicken the Levees: The water of the Yellow River contains a large amount of sand and mud. According to Zhang Qiyun's estimate, it accounts for about 11%. The Book of Han once said: "One shi of Jing River water contains six dou of mud." In fact, the Jing River is sometimes entirely mud slurry. Although the Yellow River is not as bad as the Jing River, the mud and sand content of 11% is still quite high. After flowing slowly for two thousand li, how can the riverbed not be raised by the accumulation of mud and sand? The targeted solution is to remove the sand. In the past, during a certain period of the Qing Dynasty, river dredging was also used to govern the Yellow River, but the old method was used, so it was not very effective. Today, the Panama Canal is constantly dredged using modern dredgers. Before the July 7th Incident, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs' Dredging Bureau had eight dredgers, which regularly undertook dredging work; one of them was the largest in the world. As a result of the dredging, in a very short period of time, the Shintang Shoal in the Yangtze River was prevented from hindering navigation, and the effect was remarkable. Therefore, the author believes that to deal with the high riverbed of the Yellow River, dredgers can be used to deepen it section by section; the cost is low and the operation is easy. The dredged mud can be used to thicken the levees on both banks, so that the levees will not be neglected. Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>In summary, after the dam is built, the downstream of the Yellow River can be free from the danger of sudden floods; deepening the riverbed can lower the riverbed day by day, and strengthen the levees. The main causes and contributing factors of river disasters can be eliminated, and the Yellow River will naturally not have floods again.</p>
<p>(C) Economic Review of the Aforementioned Remediation Plan</p>
<p>(1) Cost of Dam Construction: We know that the construction cost of a large Yangtze River dam is between 700 million and 1.3 billion US dollars. The water volume of the Yellow River is much smaller than that of the Yangtze River, and the Yangtze River dam also requires many navigation facilities. The Yellow River has a smaller flow and smaller ship tonnage, the main purpose being only to regulate water volume. The cost for navigation facilities can be simplified. Therefore, the construction cost will inevitably be cheaper than that of the Yangtze River dam. Although the electricity generated will also be smaller, it seems possible to recover the cost of dam construction with the income from the electricity generated.</p>
<p>(2) Compensation for the "Artificial Lake" and the Transformation of Agriculture in North China: The "artificial lake" created by the dam will inevitably be quite large; otherwise, it cannot fulfill the mission of regulating water volume. Therefore, some fields will inevitably be abandoned into the lake. However, after the lake surface is created, the mountain land on both sides of the lake, which was originally unable to obtain irrigation benefits, can now use electricity to draw water from the "artificial lake" to irrigate those barren hills, turning them into forests and farms, to compensate for the loss of creating the lake. Furthermore, we can broadly use the electricity generated by the dam to make agriculture on the entire Loess Plateau take a leap forward. With modern scientific and technological advancements, once seeds, planting methods, fertilizers, and pest control are all improved, the agricultural products on this vast plain will surely increase dramatically. The loss caused by creating the artificial lake is insignificant.</p>
<p>(3) Improvements in Navigation: As mentioned above, the Yellow River is often less than one zhang deep and no more than dozens of zhang wide. Because it is so shallow, although the downstream of the Yellow River can be navigated by civilian boats from Rongze onwards, the shallow riverbed makes navigation very difficult. In April and May, when the river water is low, boatmen in some shallow areas east of Rongze have to undress and get into the river to push the boats along. A large river with such difficult navigation is truly rare in the world. Now, if dredgers are used to deepen it section by section, and the dam is used to regulate and control the appropriate water volume, then navigation will be greatly facilitated. Not only civilian boats, but perhaps small steamships of several dozen tons will also be able to pass without obstruction.</p>
<p>(4) Development of Industry and Mining and Other Economic Benefits: The provinces traversed by the Yellow River are extremely rich in mineral resources, and Shanxi Province's coal mines are famous throughout the world. We know that after the completion of the Dnieper River Dam in the Soviet Union, many newly emerging industries sprang up, and in a short period of time, a city with a population of 300,000 was created. By analogy, with the construction of the Yellow River Dam, the industry and mining of North China will undoubtedly develop greatly, and the dam site will inevitably become a transportation and industrial center; the rise of a brand-new city is absolutely to be expected. Furthermore, due to the development of industry and agriculture in the entire North China region, production will increase sharply, the wealth of the people will increase, and commerce will inevitably become more prosperous. Then, doesn't the prosperity of the North depend on the Yellow River? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Random Notes from Prison</h3>
<p>— Yao Jun</p>
<p>In prison, I come into contact with about twenty fellow inmates every day. I have inquired about their cases and studied their criminal facts. According to my observation, many of them have been wronged, and a small number of them have committed crimes in a confused manner. In these twenty-odd cases, I have not found a single one who knowingly committed a crime. Almost invariably, when each person finished telling me his story, they all said with emotion, "I suffered this loss because I was too honest!..."</p>
<p>For example, the small businessman Wang Xingshun, whose cousin killed someone in a dispute over the purchase of land. The murderer naturally fled, but he was sued in court. The judge asked him, "So-and-so was killed, do you know that?" "Reporting to the judge, of course I know..." "Were you at the scene when he was killed?" "I wasn't at the scene..." "Did you see the body?" "I saw it later..." "Did the deceased have any grudges with your family?" "He was just competing with my cousin to buy a piece of land..." "Then he had grudges with your family..." As a result, he was convicted of "joint murder" and sentenced to ten years in prison.</p>
<p>Also, the village head named Guan, one day he sent two deserters to the county government escorted by village guards. On the way, because the deserters wanted to seize the guns and escape, one of the village guards shot them dead. Later, the village guard was sentenced to ten years in prison, while he was charged with "inciting murder" and sentenced to life imprisonment. The main reason for establishing his crime was: someone testified that he had said to the village guard, "If they want to escape on the way, you can shoot them dead." However, the village guard had already died in prison from illness and could not be cross-examined...</p>
<p>As for the tenant farmer named Wu, he was transformed from the plaintiff into the defendant. Because he owed the landlord some rent grain, he was arrested, hung up, and beaten. Feeling resentful, he came to the court to sue, and invited several witnesses. But during the trial, the judge asked him what kind of rope was used to tie him up. He said it was a palm rope. The witnesses said it was a hemp rope. He said it was more than one zhang long. The witnesses said it was seven or eight chi long. As a result, he was falsely accused of "false accusation" and sentenced to six months in prison. The three witnesses were also sentenced to perjury, also for six months in prison.</p>
<p>I have heard and seen too many examples like this. Therefore, there is a popular saying here: "One word in the public court, nine oxen cannot pull it back!" This is an experienced saying that many people have exchanged for at the cost of their grievances.</p>
<p>It is said that in many truly confirmed cases, as long as you flatly deny it, the judge cannot convict you. But in many unjust cases, you can be framed and convicted for a slip of the tongue. Therefore, those who suck people's marrow and shed people's blood can often go scot-free, while those who dare not even kill a chicken end up becoming "murderers" and sitting in prison...</p>
<p>I am a layman when it comes to law. I don't want to make arbitrary criticisms, nor am I interested in uttering any grand theories here. Of course, our judicial system has its own complete set. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Overcoat</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>This morning, my father, who usually sleeps in late, suddenly got up very early, didn't even have porridge, and hurriedly stepped out of the door. I asked him where he was going. He replied, "To the Commissioner's Office." I was startled and asked him, "What's the matter?" He smiled and said, "To draw lots!"</p>
<p>Later, I asked my mother and learned that recently the county received a batch of old clothes sent by the Relief Administration and decided to distribute them to all public education personnel in the county by drawing lots. Last night, they were notified that everyone had to go to the Commissioner's Office this morning to draw lots. It is said that those with a bright forehead can draw an overcoat or suit, while those with a dark forehead will only get some old socks, broken hats, or menstrual belts. "We have always been unlucky. It looks like we'll only get a share of old socks and menstrual belts. It's really not worth rushing out so early!" said my mother.</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily so. Maybe today Father will be lucky and draw a top-notch leather coat, so you can show it off in the New Year!" I said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Dream on!" Mother retorted me.</p>
<p>Waiting and waiting, until a quarter past nine, Father came back panting. It wasn't a dream. What he held in his hand was actually an overcoat. Although it couldn't be called "top-notch," it could be said that it was a "three-lifetime blessing" for such a "distinguished guest" to visit Mother's old box! So the whole family rejoiced, especially Mother, whose pair of bound feet almost flew up.</p>
<p>Father said triumphantly that when he drew this overcoat, even the secretary of the Commissioner's Office was envious and kept congratulating him. He also said that although the style of this overcoat was not very modern, it was indeed a genuine imported product. If we didn't believe it, he told us to put our noses up to it and smell it: "Isn't there a smell of milk and butter? Foreigners eat milk and butter, so their clothes have this smell."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Mother hurriedly put her nose to the overcoat, and while squinting and smiling, she mumbled: "This material is still very strong! At least it can be worn for five years; oh, after wearing it for five years, we can ask a Red Gang tailor to turn it over and wear it for another five years; oh! There's even flannel lining inside! In the future, when the outer fabric is torn, we can take out this flannel lining and make shirts, pants, and linings for cotton shoes..."</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen from across the Pacific, who eat milk and butter! If you see this Chinese woman, hunched over your old coat, planning her "ten-year plan," will you be surprised and amused, or will you shed tears of sorrow?</p>
<p>Long Serial</p>
<h3>Doubly Nesting, Doubly Flying (3)(5)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>"What if I'm pushed too hard?" the landlady said, not wanting to be outdone.</p>
<p>"If I'm pushed too hard, I'll beat you, you old woman!" Boss Liao said, rolling up his sleeves and making a threatening gesture.</p>
<p>The landlady panicked and quickly grabbed the large medicine-cutting knife, holding it up defensively towards Boss Liao, while saying fiercely:</p>
<p>"Come on, I'll fight you to the death today! If I don't slaughter a pig during the New Year, I'll have to slaughter you!"</p>
<p>The landlady stepped forward with the knife, looking just like her executioner father. Boss Liao was a little afraid at this point. The landlady was wielding a shiny, murderous weapon, which was no joke! If he was careless, he could end up with a bloody head on the ground. But Boss Liao couldn't let the landlady see that he was afraid. Just as he was in a difficult position, Liao Liang happened to be in the courtyard, grabbing handfuls of the cut medicine and scattering it all over the ground. So Boss Liao had a flash of inspiration and quickly ran out, grabbed Liao Liang, and scolded him in a feigned anger.</p>
<p>"I'm already unlucky enough. You, you little devil, are still wasting medicine!"</p>
<p>Liao Liang burst into tears.</p>
<p>The landlady was indeed tricked. She hurriedly put down the knife and rushed over to grab Liao Liang back, scolding:</p>
<p>"You're unlucky, what does it have to do with my son? Shameless old ghost, you dare to vent your anger on a child."</p>
<p>After arguing with Boss Liao in a shrewish manner, the landlady returned to the room and cried for a while, wiping away her tears and snot. Boss Liao, fearing that things would escalate, changed his attitude and said to the landlady calmly:</p>
<p>"Business is bad, so I don't have much money. It's not that I deliberately don't want to buy a pig. Think about it, there are five or six shop assistants in the store, and at the end of the year, I have to give them bonuses and wages. I didn't even pay them last month. Where would I have extra money to buy a pig?"</p>
<p>"If business is bad, you should think of other ways! Buying a pig isn't worth losing ten strings of cash!" The landlady said, wiping the tears from the corner of her eyes, sobbing.</p>
<p>"What other ways are there? The world has changed. Foreign things are prospering, and Chinese things are just unlucky!" Boss Liao said, sighing with emotion.</p>
<p>"You can fire one shop assistant and buy a pig. If there's no business, why do you need so many shop assistants?"</p>
<p>These words reminded Boss Liao. He didn't adopt her suggestion to realize the landlady's plan to buy a pig, but he felt that this was a way to save expenses and reduce the burden. Anyway, there was still a lot of medicine in stock. First, there was no need to go out to purchase it anymore. Second, the medicine that had already been cut was enough to sell for three to five months. Therefore, the shop assistant who purchased the medicine could be fired. The apprentices who cut the medicine could also be fired. Only one master was enough. In this way, the Huichuntang would save a lot of money, and the family's life would be slightly more comfortable. (Buying a pig was naturally not a problem.) After deciding on this austerity policy, he decided to implement it before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The information about Huichuntang's austerity was told to Baoling by Liao Dong, who also congratulated Baoling that he was not included in the austerity budget. This indeed made Baoling feel gratified! He was not afraid of losing his job and having no food to eat, but he was afraid that if he lost his job, he would have to go back home. He didn't want to go back home; it was because he didn't want to be a parasite of the Mo family; he would rather be a slave of the Liao family!</p>

<h3>Dispute Erupts Among Rice Merchants; Black Market for Rice Emerges</h3>
<p>Social Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Conduct Thorough Investigation and Prohibits Brokers from Entering the Market</p>
<p>Since the authorities have adopted strict management of the rice market, the market conditions appear to be very stable on the surface. However, in reality, rice stores have the notion of creating a black market because they have no goods to purchase. Yesterday's registered arrivals were approximately 3,700 shi, but transactions were very rare. When rice stores attempted to purchase from the rice wholesalers, the rice wholesalers claimed that they had already sold out. A dispute then arose between one rice wholesaler and one rice store. According to a certain gentleman in the rice industry, for the past three days of this week, the registered arrivals have been over 10,000 shi. However, for the first two days, transactions were only around 1,000 to 2,000 shi. This morning, it was even less, only several hundred shi, and all of it was inferior goods sold at high prices. The rice stores are truly suffering from a lack of goods to sell. It is heard that the Social Bureau is dispatching personnel to investigate, and yesterday posted a notice in the rice market, stating: "Upon investigation, the rice price in this city has gradually stabilized in recent days. It is hoped that rice merchants will exercise their conscience, conduct business in an orderly manner, and benefit the people's livelihood. However, according to reports, there are still a few unscrupulous merchants, engaging in speculation and manipulation, and engaging in black market transactions, resulting in the rise of black market rice prices in recent days. This shows that a few rice merchants are defiant and unafraid of the law, which is truly hateful and should be strictly prohibited to maintain the people's food supply. In addition to the announcement, it is urgently ordered that, starting from the date of this order, brokers are not allowed to enter the market, and black market transactions are strictly prohibited. Anyone who dares to violate this will be severely punished without leniency upon discovery."</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market's source of supply was sluggish, and transactions were also rare. The situation was firm. Flour stores, on the other hand, were very active, and appetite for purchases was strong, with prices rising by over a thousand yuan. The soybean market trend turned firm and attractive. Raw peanuts were also selling well, with prices increasing by one or two thousand yuan. Broad beans were high and stable, while intermediate grades were flat. Corn was tired and then recovered, with prices rising by a thousand yuan. Small wheat from Ningbo was slightly purchased, and the flour market rose, followed by a rise of over a thousand yuan. Bean cakes' appetite for village sales was not good, firm in the morning and tired in the afternoon. The oil market digestion turned better, with prices increasing by two thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Plummet - The Bitter Fruit of Speculation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a large multi-position trader in a building on Eighth Floor dumped a huge amount, and the situation suddenly became tragic. Series C bonds, which opened at around 5,200 yuan in the morning, gradually declined to 4,200 yuan before slightly stabilizing and closing a hundred yuan higher. The trend will continue to decline. The result was a tragic drop of 900 yuan compared to the previous close. Series A and B were dragged down by a small amount of 550 yuan, Series D fell by 700 yuan, and Series E by 600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Transactions are Both Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was very firm and attractive. The Guangzhou buyers suddenly had a strong appetite for buying, and absorbed large-scale yarns such as Double Horse and Golden Rooster. The price was raised by 40,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The remaining medium and small-scale yarns followed suit and rose by 20,000 yuan. Twenty-count Great Flying Boat yarn was especially popular because it was favored by the Jiangxi buyers, so the spot goods were especially in demand. Fine yarn still had no progress, because the sales were not large. At noon, Fang Jian opened the yarn as usual. The price of 32-count or higher fine yarn was marked down by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan compared to the previous period. There were also 16 types of coarse and fine yarn threads, which were sold by voting.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph suddenly plummeted 39 to 46 points. The near-term contract was USD 28.70, the forward contract was USD 29.06, and the Meterlin spot price was USD 29.41. The local cotton transaction was increasingly smooth. The demand for cotton from private cotton mills was extremely urgent. Changzhou Dacheng and Minfeng cotton mills, Shanghai Anda Baofeng and other mills, each purchased 1,200 to 1,300 bales. In addition, Shenxin First Mill purchased extra-grade Meterlin at a price of 109,000 yuan, which was about 1,000 to 2,000 yuan higher than before.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin are Weak and Declining</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market was similar to the previous day in the morning, but fell 30,000 to 40,000 yuan in the afternoon. 120 Tianqiao filament opened at 1.48 million yuan, and traded at 1.44 million yuan in the afternoon. Miscellaneous brands of Beauty sold for 330,000 yuan in the morning, and slightly less 20,000 in the afternoon. Yinniao semi-lustrous goods were popular, and the price was the same as the previous day. 150 Jin San Ma filament was slightly less at 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. 75 Jin Ji semi-lustrous goods traded for 1.52 million yuan in the morning, but were short 20,000 yuan in the afternoon. Factory silk 75 points in even grade opened at 1.2 million to 1.225 million yuan. Middle-grade 5 dan silk was another 50,000 yuan higher compared to the previous day. Foreign company goods of high even grade had no transactions. Dry warp silk also did not open. The asking price for 5 dan heads was 560,000 to 600,000 yuan. For silk fabrics, Meiya quilt covers were 1.65 million yuan in the morning, and short 50,000 yuan in the afternoon, with very few transactions. Dacheng Gezi Bizhou had a maximum price of 6,090 yuan in the morning, but later some large traders sold at a high price, so it retraced slightly to 5,750 yuan, and then went down slightly another 50 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Hankou Bristle Price - USD 4.30</h3>
<p>The pig bristle market has been extremely quiet recently. The goods in Tianjin and Shanghai have no market. Recently, only 200 dan of Hankou bristles and 80 dan of Sichuan bristles were traded. Hankou bristles sold for USD 4.30 per pound. The price of Sichuan bristles was unchanged. In addition, 2,000 dan of Sichuan pig bristles traded in May and June have also been shipped and will be shipped to the United States in batches in the near future.</p>
<h3>Serge Demand Exceeds Supply</h3>
<p>Serge, in addition to silk and artificial cotton, regardless of thick or thin, dark blue, primary colors, straw yellow, and straw green, are currently in demand for trading. Buyers from Chongqing, Chengdu, Henan, Hunan, and the Beijing-Hangzhou Road have successively requested samples. The industry colleagues in this street have also been absorbing each other. With the limited inventory, there is a trend of demand exceeding supply. Yin Feng 101, Hualun 210, Hua Jiu 18, and Hongkang 4000 and other brands are selling even better.</p>
<h3>Timber Actual Sales Not Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the timber market situation was strong and prosperous due to persistent actual sales and stimulated by gold currency. The market trend gradually improved, with slight increases in both foreign pine and local Anhui timber prices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, news arrived that the William Lyburn, a vessel managed by the Dodwell shipping company, was transporting 4,500,000 feet of lumber from Seattle. The ship was scheduled to arrive at the Wusongkou port last evening. However, due to a lack of space for floating docks within the harbor, it is temporarily anchored outside the mouth, awaiting entry.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Sells Off According to Market Prices: Gold Price Reduced by Over 40,000; Settlement Suspends Supply, Abundance Prevails; US Dollar Also Falls Back 70 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market initially started strong but then weakened. At the opening, prices were moderate. Afterward, the US dollar remained popular, bolstering buying power and pushing the price to 1,985,000 before gradually stabilizing. The Central Bank allocated 206 gold bars to the industry at a price of 1,960,000. Following this, the upward trend was hindered, and the Central Bank released over a hundred bars into the market, gradually shifting from strong to weak. Multiple parties lacked the power to resist, leading to substantial liquidation. At noon, the price fell back to 1,920,000. In the afternoon, the Central Bank's selling intentions intensified, repeatedly selling off and pushing the price down to within 1,900,000 before stabilizing slightly. As a result, the closing price was 45,000 lower than the previous day's. Gold ornaments were valued at 1,002,000. Silver ingots and silver dollars remained stable. The demand for unofficial discounts was high, with interest rates rising slightly to around 1.5 jiao.</p>
<p>The foreign currency, the US dollar, continued to advance sharply, but selling pressure gradually increased at higher levels. It opened at 2720 yuan in the morning. Afterward, demand continued to exceed supply, unexpectedly surging to 2810 yuan before slightly retracting. As multiple parties began to liquidate their positions, a turbulent situation arose. At noon, the price dropped to 2720 yuan as settlements concluded. The situation further weakened in the afternoon, with an abundance of supply, causing the price to fall back to around 2670 yuan before stabilizing slightly. Consequently, the closing price was 70 yuan lower than the previous day's. Hong Kong currency started strong but remained steady, falling back 10 yuan from 465 yuan to close, mirroring the previous day's closing. The same was true for Indian currency, closing at 565 yuan. Hong Kong currency had sell orders at 460 yuan, and the US currency was nominally flat but actually stagnant.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to trend upward as both the Sugar Merchants' Association and companies did not open for sales. The Association quoted prices for medium-grain white sugar at 78,500 to 79,000 yuan for double bags in the morning and 80,000 yuan for single bags. Prices softened slightly in the afternoon, initially holding the original prices but later changing to 79,500 to 78,500 yuan. Warehouse receipts were even tighter, trading at 81,500 to 82,000 yuan in the morning, then slightly decreasing to 81,750 to 81,500 yuan, and further softening to 80,000 yuan in the afternoon. Three-and-a-half carloads of white sugar were priced at 95,000 yuan. Special grade Qing sugar was offered at 65,000 yuan, and the next grade at 62,000-63,000 yuan. Rock sugar was priced at 100,500 to 115,000 yuan, and refined Qing sugar at 65,000-66,000 yuan, later increasing by 2,000-3,000 yuan without any transactions.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Caustic Soda Price Surge</h3>
<p>The price of caustic soda, an industrial raw material, has risen sharply in recent days. According to investigations, the reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Local spot inventory is dwindling daily. (2) Demand from the dyeing and weaving industries and other regions is substantial. (3) Export procedures from Europe and the United States are cumbersome. (4) Import and export companies are unwilling to accept new orders. (5) A certain foreign firm has not been allocating goods for a long time. These factors have created the conditions for a sharp price increase.</p>
<h3>Long Positions Cashed Out at High Prices; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Enter Slump Again; China Textile Increases Capital, Giving Two Shares for Each Share</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks initially stabilized but then weakened, though the process was quite steady. The overall trend shifted to consolidation. Yong'an Spinning reached a high price of 6,150 yuan, Meiya 4,650 yuan, Jingfu 320 yuan, Xinguang 313 yuan, and Qinxing 242 yuan. The low prices were Yong'an Spinning 5,700 yuan, Meiya 4,350 yuan, Jingfu 298 yuan, Xinguang 292 yuan, and Qinxing 218 yuan. Prices hovered around these levels at noon. As a result, due to some liquidation of long positions, Yong'an Spinning, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang all experienced slight declines. Qinxing fell by more than half a percentage point. Among other popular small and medium-sized stocks, besides New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, which remained steady due to its low price, the rest also saw slight declines. Veteran stocks also weakened. Operators in foreign stocks remained inactive, and securities firms also stood by as observers. Consequently, with some unloading from foreign merchants and financial circles, the situation could not be sustained. Yishun Spinning fell by slightly less than 10% from an opening of around 12,500 yuan to just over 1,000 yuan. Apart from Yeguang and Steel Industries, which were being absorbed, the rest of the stocks all saw slight declines. By the close at noon, Yishun Spinning was down slightly less than 10%, while Yeguang and Steel Industries remained steady. The rest had all fallen back by about half a percentage point.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the China Textile Mill's capital adjustment plan was approved by shareholders yesterday, increasing the value from 99 million pseudo-Central Reserve Certificates to 29.7 million legal tender, with each old share receiving two bonus shares.</p>
<h3>Ningzhou Sprout Tea Sells Well</h3>
<p>Ningzhou sprout tea has been adopted in the Suzhou area due to its affordable price. Unfortunately, the market inventory is low, creating a situation where demand exceeds supply. Yesterday, the market only saw the sale of over forty dan by the Anhui Tea Company, priced at 30,000 yuan per dan. The market atmosphere remained solid. Although other grades from nearby villages are still hesitant to watch the market, holders maintain a firm stance. With local shops and firms continuously acquiring tea, the trend is considered sharp.</p>
<h3>Imported and Exported Poultry and Livestock Must Be Reported for Inspection First</h3>
<p>Imported and exported livestock and poultry often carry infectious diseases. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has resumed inspections from the 10th of this month. All livestock and poultry that have not been inspected and issued a certificate will not be allowed to be declared for import or export. The Ministry has been notified to inform the Jianghai Customs to assist in accordance with the regulations. All livestock imported from foreign countries must be reported to the Bureau for inspection by filling out an inspection form 24 hours before import. If necessary, they may be required to submit a certificate of inspection issued by the veterinary institute of the source area or the exporting country's government. Upon arrival, officials from the Bureau will conduct inspections on board the ship or at other designated locations. If they are deemed healthy and free from disease, a certificate will be issued for release.</p>
<h3>Chinese Silk Sales to England: 2.5 Million Pounds, Official British Estimates</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] A representative of the British Board of Trade recently stated in response to an inquiry in the House of Commons that Britain could obtain 17,000,000 pounds of raw silk from Japan in the next twelve months, of which 6% could be allocated to the United Kingdom. This proportion is based on the pre-war percentage of Japanese trade with the United States. Regarding how much raw silk Britain could obtain from China, it was stated that it is currently impossible to predict. It is expected that 2,500,000 pounds could be obtained after the cocoon harvest this season. The export of raw silk from China is not subject to any allocation arrangements.</p>
<h3>American Steel Industry Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese Holdings Have Decreased</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 12th] The amount of American steel industry stocks held by foreigners only accounts for 5.36% of the common stock and 1.488% of the preferred stock, spread across fifty countries around the world. Only five countries hold more than 5,000 shares of preferred and common stock. In Asia, China has decreased its holdings from 1,336 shares at the end of last year to 420 shares. Manila holds only 100 shares, while India holds 70 shares of common stock and 141 shares of preferred stock.</p>
<h3>Who is Hoarding US Dollars? Import-Export Merchants Say It's Jews and Speculators</h3>
<p>Recently, merchants have found it difficult to obtain approval for foreign exchange to purchase non-essential goods. They have sought alternative routes by depositing US dollars in foreign banks in Shanghai, and the foreign banks issue demand drafts payable in the US. They directly send these drafts to the US to place orders, saving the trouble of applying for foreign exchange and allowing them to place orders at any time. However, according to the Import-Export Association, the widespread rumor that import-export merchants are hoarding large amounts of US dollars is not entirely true. The majority of the activity is driven by Jewish merchants and speculators seeking to profit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to reduce the massive import of non-essential goods, the authorities are strictly enforcing the review of foreign exchange applications. It is rumored that foreign banks in Shanghai will be instructed to stop the outflow of currency, and the customs authorities will be instructed to conduct detailed inspections of imported goods. If there is no foreign exchange settlement certificate, the goods will not be allowed to be imported.</p>
<h3>Rayon Supply Difficult; American and Italian Prices Exceed Shanghai; Surplus Enemy Assets Are Incomplete</h3>
<p>Before the war, most of the rayon raw materials needed by our country's silk factories came from Italy. Since the outbreak of World War II, the source of Italian goods has been cut off. With no rayon factories in the country, Japanese rayon flooded the market. During the one to two years before the victory, Japan itself was bombed repeatedly, and transportation became increasingly difficult, further diminishing the source of rayon. After the victory, it was difficult for Japanese rayon factories to recover temporarily, and the same was true for Italy. Currently, the supply of rayon in Shanghai relies entirely on the enemy property distributed by the Textile Construction Company and the China Trust Bureau. However, due to the limited supply and incomplete assortment, it is difficult to maintain price stability. The official price of rayon on the American market is 50 cents per pound, while the black market price has reached 2 US dollars per pound. Each case of 200 pounds requires 400 US dollars. The production cost in Italy is similar to that in the United States. If shipping costs and tariffs to Shanghai are added, it is estimated that each case would cost 2.5 million yuan, more than 1 million yuan higher than the market price. According to industry insiders, if the country does not find a way to produce rayon, prices may rise.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>The manager of the Shanghai branch of the Agricultural Bank of China was originally concurrently held by Assistant Manager Zhu Runsheng. It is reported that the Standing Committee of the Agricultural Bank has approved the appointment of Pan Jiufen as the manager of the Shanghai branch last week.</p>
<p>Overseas remittances from Nanyang have been gradually increasing recently. To facilitate overseas Chinese, the Bank of China has dispatched personnel to prepare for the reopening of its Batavia branch in the Dutch East Indies. It is expected to officially open on August 1st. Branches in Surabaya and Ipoh are also being planned for reopening. If the situation in the Dutch East Indies improves, they should be able to open on Double Tenth Day this year.</p>

<p>Publishing Industry Special Edition</p>
<h3>A Word of Advice to the Chinese Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>— A Warning</p>
<p>The Chinese publishing industry is evidently quite impoverished, and now seems to be somewhat pathological. Chinese publications, analyzed according to their nature, can generally be classified into three categories. The first category consists of propaganda materials from politicians. These are not necessarily explicitly political articles. This type of publication may be literary, sociological, philosophical, or even scientific, but their primary purpose is not academic but rather a tool for politicians to achieve certain political goals. The content of these publications is often a kind of Party jargon. The second category is textbooks prescribed by the Ministry of Education. These are all stereotyped articles that must meet certain standards. There is no spirit of academic freedom here, and no room for free expression. The third category is pornographic publications. They cater to low tastes. The writers only care about payment, and the publishers only care about making money. Here, anything goes, from fabricating rumors to creating incidents out of thin air.</p>
<p>Please readers, choose fairly! How many books in the Chinese publishing industry are purely academic research? How many books introduce the latest Western science? How many books introduce the daily knowledge necessary for modern life? There are so few it's pitiful! Why? Because there is no market, publishers are unwilling to lose money. If publishers don't want something, no one dares to try writing it.</p>
<p>We believe that the Chinese publishing industry places too much emphasis on business. Therefore, the things they publish always try to cater to the readers' tastes, instead of raising the readers' tastes. We believe that this is not serving the cultural community, but hindering cultural development. We hope that publishers will publish more academic works, books that fairly discuss the world situation and national construction, and publications that are beneficial to daily social life. Political parties can have their propaganda tools, but the general publishing industry should be liberated from political parties. The publishing industry can meet the needs of the masses, but at the same time it should shoulder the responsibility of raising the cultural level of the masses.</p>
<h3>"Thought and Society"</h3>
<p>— Chuan Tongxian</p>
<p>Author: Zhang Dongsun</p>
<p>Publisher: The Commercial Press</p>
<p>Date: Chongqing Edition, March 1946</p>
<p>Pages: 204</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Zhang sent me his book "Thought and Society," published in Chongqing, which is a sequel to his "Knowledge and Culture." The entire book has nine chapters, which can be divided into six major parts: (1) A general discussion of the social factors of human thought; (2) An explanation of three knowledge systems; (3) The relationship between philosophy and social organization; (4) The Chinese tradition—Confucian thought and Neo-Confucianism; (5) The Western tradition—Christian thought, socialism, and democracy; (6) The future of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Because this book has not yet been released in Shanghai, I think everyone would like to see it as soon as possible. Now I will just draw an outline of the content of this book and give a brief introduction. As for my criticisms of this book, I will publish them in the next issue.</p>
<p>I. Factors in the Organization of Human Thought</p>
<p>There are three basic factors in the organization of human thought: (1) The perceptual configuration of biological nature; (2) The purely formal conceptual framework; (3) The functional determination of social culture. To put it more simply, they are (1) sensory experience, (2) conceptual form, and (3) social culture. These three layers are mutually intertwined rather than independent. Human thought is based on concepts, and concepts are influenced by perceptual configurations on the one hand and determined by culture on the other. In other words, the formation of concepts is due to two aspects: one is due to the schematization of perception, and the other is due to the symbolization of representation. Human perception of the outside world has a Gestalt organization, and the image left behind by this perception is not exactly the same as the perceptual object. This image is often extremely vague and only retains a general outline. Thus, the specificity of the perceptual object gradually disappears. And images with similar outlines are organized to form a universal prototype, which is what we call a concept. But a concept is not only a schematization of perception on the subjective side, but also a symbolization of representation for mutual communication between individuals. Because of the need for social co-existence, we need to express our emotions to each other, so there is language, and the symbolization and abstraction of language becomes thought.</p>
<p>II. Three Knowledge Systems</p>
<p>In essence, human knowledge is based on the biological standpoint on the one hand and inseparable from the background of social culture on the other. Thus, several systems of human knowledge are built on these two aspects. Mr. Zhang specifically proposes three major knowledge systems and explains their relationship with society. These three knowledge systems are (1) the common sense system, (2) the scientific system, and (3) the metaphysical system. Common sense is created by distinguishing it from a unified whole of perception. This creation is purely for convenience, and this convenience is due to biological use, psychological simplification, and social learning. Science extracts facts from the nature of things. Metaphysics treats ideals as reality, and its purpose is to create "ideal reality." Mr. Zhang said: "The tool relied upon in the common sense system is the distinction of perception, and the method is analogy. In the scientific system, the tool relied upon is the analytical effort of reason, and the method is measurement and experimentation. As for metaphysics, it relies on 'insight.' It is the so-called deductive method."</p>
<p>These three knowledge systems are three realms created to meet cultural needs. The common sense system is for the convenience of daily life habits; science is for human beings to deal with nature, understand nature, and explain nature. Metaphysics is limited to the cultural aspect, and it should include morality, society, and politics. Metaphysical knowledge is the reason for establishing faith. It is not only "knowing", but also naturally changes one's behavior after knowing.</p>
<p>Although these three knowledge systems are built on psychological foundations, their development is entirely within the scope of culture.</p>
<p>III. Philosophical Theories and Social Organization</p>
<p>The predecessor of metaphysics is religion, and religion is the method for human beings to find spiritual comfort. Metaphysics is not the highest knowledge or the truest knowledge. It is limited to the realm of ideals, and it is only finding reasons for actual life. This knowledge system is "non-experimental" and at the same time must be "historical." The nature of metaphysics is determined by tradition. Its problems are inherited from tradition, and the concepts it uses are based on its own tradition. Therefore, Zhang Guangsheng believes that the concepts used and the problems raised by metaphysics express the tradition of that culture. Taking British empiricism as an example, this philosophical thought is closely related to the entire British culture. From official experience, the "anti-mysticism", individualism, and utilitarianism traditions are deduced.</p>
<p>From another perspective, social organization has its own psychological foundation. Society cannot be separated from language. If individual minds do not possess a common concept for mutual communication, society cannot be established. The cultural tradition of a nation not only includes social systems, moral standards, but also ways of thinking and national character. For example, Chinese society has a set of Chinese-style thoughts, and Indian society has a set of Indian-style thoughts. As for how human thought determines actual society, Mr. Zhang puts forward a special argument. He believes that the active influence of thought is limited to stabilizing and ordering society, but if someone uses thought to stir up social change, this is not very powerful. Therefore, Mr. Zhang said: "Social systems are shaken more by their own flaws. Theories can only fuel the waves, not create them. As for turning from shaking and breaking to stability, the power of theory is not small in this process. Because it is necessary to make almost everyone in a society comparatively acknowledge that such an organization is appropriate or close to reasonable, so that people's hearts can be at peace... From this, we know why many scholars come out and work hard on the explanation of 'reason', wanting to establish a theoretical system, but in fact they are only trying to obtain a better state for human affairs, or only seeking a relatively comfortable state psychologically." (Page 86)</p>
<p>IV. Chinese and Western Traditions</p>
<p>The Chinese and Western traditions include moral standards, social systems, and political principles, and there must be a set of metaphysical mysteries as its backbone. Chinese philosophy history has a series of concepts that represent the mental prototypes of Chinese culture. Their development all has its social background and social influence. Mr. Zhang proposed several major concepts, "Heaven," "Dao," "Virtue," "Benevolence," "Righteousness," "Principle," "Nature," and "Ritual," and explained them systematically and developmentally.</p>
<p>And I want to infer the influence on social and political aspects from the development of these concepts. In the pre-Qin period, the Chinese tradition was Confucian thought, and in the Song and Ming dynasties, it was Neo-Confucianism. Ancient social organizations always tended to the collective whole and neglected individual characteristics. The emphasis on heaven by Chinese Confucians or the emphasis on the unity of all things by Neo-Confucians is the thought of emphasizing the whole. The characteristic of Chinese culture is that there is a scholar class in Chinese society, and this scholar class is responsible for maintaining this tradition.</p>
<p>For the Western tradition, Mr. Zhang proposed (1) Christian thought, (2) socialism, and (3) democracy, two thought systems. The teachings of Christianity can be summarized into five points: (1) believe in only one God; (2) take love as the nature of God; (3) take faith as life; (4) original sin; (5) eternal life. The development of Western culture relies on the maintenance of this Christian spirit. Marx's socialism also has several unique concepts: (1) surplus value tax, (2) historical materialism, (3) class struggle, (4) deduction (formerly translated as dialectics), (5) the social revolution theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The motivation of this theory is still to save the world, and its sincerity is even greater than any religion. Democracy in the West is not only a system, but also a culture, a way of life. This concept comes from socialism, and it contains all aspects of culture. Democracy is not only the spiritual tradition of the West, but also the treasure of all mankind.</p>
<p>V. The Future of Chinese Culture</p>
<p>Since Chinese culture came into contact with Western culture, it is now in a transitional period. The first time Western culture transitioned from the Middle Ages to modern times, it produced naturalism, individualism, nationalism, and rationalism. The second time it transitioned to modern times, modern thought is socialist, internationalist, emotionalist, and collectivist. Since China came into contact with Western culture, she must not only accept the individualism and liberalism of the 19th century in the West, but also accept the socialism and collectivism of the 20th century in the West at the same time. Thus, China is caught in a double contradictory life; on the one hand, she must resolve the conflict between Chinese and Western cultures, and on the other hand, she must adapt to two different Western cultures. Mr. Zhang said: "Today's problem in China is that it missed the Western cultural stage... For example, it has not been long since China changed the imperial system, and the atmosphere of autocracy still exists in people's hearts. In theory, only freedom and civil rights should be advocated, but in the trend, the meaning of the government representing the national whole must be raised, which is no different from helping the government to carry out its long-standing habits of dictatorship."</p>
<p>The only way to solve China's problems now is to restore the mission of the original scholar class. Let them stand up and use the power of public opinion to distinguish right from wrong, and use international organizations and international economic forces to give these scholar class people an independent and autonomous "education association" that is not controlled by the government, so that international forces can have moral, rational, and cultural forces in the country as new blood for the construction of a new China.</p>
<h3>"On Foreign Investment in China"</h3>
<p>— Yang Jie</p>
<p>Author: C. F. Remer Translator: Jiang Xuekai Zhao Kangjie Publisher: Commercial Press</p>
<p>The abolishment of unequal treaties has stirred the confidence of many friends concerned with China's economic construction. The victorious end of the war against Japan, the replacement of the Japanese overseas market, and the utilization of domestic industrial equipment have aroused our immense hopes. All sorts of favorable conditions seem to have been arranged, awaiting only our efforts. However, since the end of the war to this day, we have seen not the erection of chimneys, but only the successive cessation of smoke. Whether engaged in light or heavy industry, all are lamenting the severity of the industrial crisis. This crisis is multifaceted: foreign exchange policies promote the decline of foreign trade [foreign exchange policies only encourage imports, neglecting the adverse consequences on production], currency inflation promotes labor-management disputes... Regarding foreign exchange policies and currency inflation, many scholars have already discussed them in detail. However, the capital, one of the three elements of production, has been discussed by very few people. I specifically recommend C. F. Remer's "On Foreign Investment in China," a book that, I believe, is not superfluous in today's call for unified efforts to promote China's modernization!</p>
<p>This unique and systematic study of foreign investment in China, although using data from before 1930, allows us to glean the trends of foreign capital formation and its inherent factors from the summarization of past facts, serving as a reference for us today. Remer wrote this book entirely under the commission of the Pacific International Institute. Because at that time, the utilization of foreign capital and foreign investment in China was not only a topic of enthusiastic discussion among Chinese, but also a subject of attention for foreigners. Therefore, at the Pacific Institute's meetings, foreign investment in China was listed as a major topic. For the sake of thorough understanding, Remer was commissioned to complete this book. Remer was an appropriate choice, having taught for many years at St. John's University in Shanghai and the University of Michigan in the United States. He possessed academic expertise. To complete this book, in addition to sending out thousands of questionnaires, he personally investigated in various treaty ports in China, as well as in England, America, France, Japan, and Southeast Asia. This diligent spirit has led to the book's achievements today!</p>
<p>The book is divided into two volumes. The first volume, General Discussion, discusses foreign investment in China and China's economic and financial status in the international arena, consisting of fourteen chapters: Introduction, China's Population and Resources, China in the Old Era, Modern Economic Relations, An Overview of Foreign Investment in China, Overview of Enterprise Investment, The Significance of Enterprise Investment, China's Foreign Debt, Foreign Investment and the Balance of Payments, Remittances from Overseas Chinese, International Trade and the Movement of Gold and Silver, China's International Balance of Payments, and China's International Economic Status. The second volume, Specific Discussions, consists of seven chapters: American Investment in China, British Investment in China, Japanese Investment in China, Russian Investment in China, French Investment in China, German Investment in China, and Investment in China by Belgium and the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>The general discussion is a general narrative. The author divides foreign investment in China into three periods: before 1900, before 1914, and before 1930. In the translator's opinion, this division has special significance. The period before 1900 was from the Opium War to the Boxer Rebellion, the situation of foreign investment in China. The period before 1914 was the situation before World War I. The period before 1930 was the situation before the September 18th Incident. We are not interested in this kind of narrative of aggressive investment. What we want to know is the other side.</p>
<p>In the opening sentence of the introduction, the author said: "Foreign investment in China is but one aspect of China's international economic relations and China's general international relations. Seeing the true face of these relationships clearly reveals the part of the world that China occupies. Understanding these relationships allows one to understand the modern world." Some scholars who study the Chinese economy believe that the Chinese economy is just a mess, with no principles to follow, or only some biased views. The author seems to intentionally avoid these, and after on-the-ground observations, he is confident that he can obtain some important facts from the collected facts and economic analysis. However, he does not believe that this is purely objective and without prejudice, because he believes that no matter who or what organization is examining the behavior of others and then making judgments, it is impossible to be completely objective. His approach is simply to do his best.</p>
<p>The author's conclusion on the nature of Chinese economic research is that, while the family is indeed the unit of Chinese society, it is also the most prominent unit in economics. This economy (family economy) is clearly different from the European and American economies (political economy). European and American political economy is where politics and economics are mutually supportive, focusing on the relationship between the state and the people's economic activities. Therefore, all mercantilism, laissez-faire policies, and neo-mercantilism simply incorporate economics and politics into the system of racial ideas and policies, which is also called economic nationalism. However, the author believes that the Chinese family economy cannot be understood simply by applying a Western term, because the most prominent thing in China is the separation of politics and economics.</p>
<p>He believes that the capital for China to develop industry cannot be obtained domestically given the generally poor living standards of the Chinese people. Although he also thought of the railway and other operating revenues, which could create new construction, this path seems impassable due to improper management and poor management. Therefore, he believes that the only source of capital is to rely on foreign investment. There are three ways to obtain the necessary capital:</p>
<p>(1) Following the example of the great powers, grant all powers to the government and officials.</p>
<p>(2) Develop private enterprises under Chinese collective individualism.</p>
<p>(3) Communism.</p>
<p>He believes that developing along the first route easily tends toward national socialism, which Chinese traditional politics likes, but an untrained official class will not easily achieve this goal. The second is to develop private enterprises, which must first form a new concept and have a constitution that constrains officials and the people, giving freedom to private enterprises and guaranteeing their rights. The third is welcomed by the rural tradition, but to succeed, it must adapt to the family and the countryside, but leading China's economic development is a difficult dream to realize. In summary, although he provided three routes, he only focused on the first two. Therefore, in the seventh chapter, The Significance of Enterprise Investment, he repeatedly mentioned that there are two routes for China's future management organization: one is government-led national socialism, and the other is private enterprises under the leadership of merchants that are suitable for Chinese industrialists.</p>
<p>The following specific section describes the actual situation of each group's investment, limited by space, I cannot do a detailed description.</p>
<p>The author said: "China's political security depends on economic security, and China's economic security also depends on political security." Today, it seems to have another layer of meaning. China's industrialization is necessary, and capital is indispensable. Don't miss the opportunity, I hope the government opens its eyes and does it boldly, and I hope that those in the opposition will promote this matter, and don't let future generations regret today's foolishness!</p>
<h3>Introducing "British Dominions"</h3>
<p>— Sun Hang</p>
<p>Author: Lou Bangyan Publisher: Commercial Press</p>
<p>The British Empire is a product of history. Therefore, it is difficult to analyze the composition of Britain from a logical point of view. Perhaps it is better to say that Britain itself is a special logic that cannot be confused with other established systems.</p>
<p>For example, using the concept of a modern country to say that Britain is a country is correct, but also wrong. Britain is a large country with the elements that a country should have, but the components of Britain, especially those dominions, are by no means provinces or local governments within a country, but also seem to be small and large countries. For example, under the United Nations mechanism, Britain's dominions such as Canada and Australia have equal footing with other countries. For example, if other parts of Britain declare war on Germany, Ireland can safely maintain neutrality. These are mysteries and challenges for researchers of political systems. But this is not Britain's fault. Studying something should be based on the facts.</p>
<p>Therefore, in studying the composition of Britain, especially the relationship between Britain and the dominions, established political theories are sometimes useless and impractical. Someone with a little political knowledge often finds it difficult to understand works on the British system. Those who explain the British system must first put forward the particularity and explain it thoroughly, and then let the readers compare it with traditional theories themselves, or more conveniently, the author himself helps the readers to compare; the worst thing to do is to first shoehorn the traditional theories, and then ignore those British-style beauties and criticize them.</p>
<p>Mr. Lou Bangyan's recent book, British Autonomy, has this style. This is a thin book of less than one hundred pages, which includes six of Mr. Lou's recent papers on the British dominions. Although it is not a book in terms of the system but a collection of six articles, it is very attractive to beginners or people who know some political systems.</p>
<p>The narration here is very easy to understand. There are no piles of political theories, no forced compromises with logic. Mr. Lou simply describes the British system in the British way. We seem to browse through it, just like sitting on a streamlined British car and traveling in Britain. Everything is British, very comfortable and natural.</p>
<p>The whole book describes a lot of facts, and the analysis is also very detailed. For those who do not understand the British system, this is an introductory book; for those who understand a lot of traditional theories, this is a reference book.</p>
<p>But the six articles were not written at the same time nor published at the same time. There are inevitably repetitions in meaning. Readers should understand that what the author wrote is not a book but a magazine article, so don't be too demanding of him. The contents of the six articles are as follows: First, the British dominions and the King. Second, the British dominions and the British Parliament. Third, the British dominions and the Imperial Conference. Fourth, the external relations of the British dominions. Fifth, the British dominions and war. Sixth, the treaty-making power of the British Empire.</p>
<p>Among each article, the historical record is very valuable. Britain was not born in its current form. It is a product of history. Without understanding her history, one cannot talk about her system. Mr. Lou is very good at seizing this opportunity. The causes and consequences he talks about can make readers feel that everything is in order.</p>
<p>Among the six chapters, the first chapter, which describes the relationship between the King and the dominions, is the most thorough. The King is a feature of Britain, and can also be said to be the source of the British system. Understanding the King's position, we already have a concept of Britain. Therefore, understanding the first chapter, and then the following chapters, will not be difficult. The fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters actually discuss the same theme, that is, the external relations of the British dominions. The three chapters have commonalities and continuity, just like the drawings made by an architect. Looking at a three-dimensional house from three aspects, the situation is clear at a glance.</p>
<p>At the end of the book, there are two book reviews introducing two books on British issues. At the beginning of the second book review, Mr. Lou said: "There are not a few books on general issues of the British Empire, but it is quite difficult to find a relatively simple one that is easily understood by the general public. Stephen Leacock's recently written book "The British Empire" can meet the conditions of being thorough and easy to understand, and can be introduced to the general public." I think Mr. Lou's "British Dominions" can also meet this condition and can be introduced to the general public.</p>
<h3>This Column Adds: Readers' Mailbox</h3>
<p>Recently, some young and studious friends often write to ask the editor how to read and what books to read. Therefore, we plan to add a readers' mailbox in the next issue of this journal to systematically introduce readers to books in various fields, and are willing to answer various questions from readers about reading. Letters of inquiry are welcome.</p>
<h3>Cultural News</h3>
<p>The "Wen Chao Monthly" Volume 1, Issue 2, published by the Wen Chao Press, was published on the first of this month. The content includes Zheng Boqi's National Research and Literary Popularization, Li Jianwu's Flaubert and Turgenev, Zhao Jingshen's Reading Kang Dui Shan's Collected Works, Zang Kejia's Family Letters, and Jin Sheng Yu Zhen co-edited by Lao She and Zhao Qingge, etc., more than ten articles. The content is extremely exciting. Each copy is still sold for six hundred yuan. It is said to be exclusively distributed by Zhengzhong Bookstore.</p>
<p>Female writer Feng Zi, formerly suffering from appendicitis, was cured after surgery at the Fifth Hospital. After a good recovery, she has now moved to the Wen Chao Publishing House in Hongkou. Following the doctor's orders, she needs to stay in and rest, so she will not be able to engage in writing work recently.</p>
<p>My country's science is backward, and the general public's scientific knowledge is also very poor. According to statistics from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, among the 65 types of publications applying for registration, only five are scientific. During this period when science is needed to build the country, the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers shoulders the task of promoting and disseminating electrical knowledge and publishes a popular electrical publication—"Electrical World Monthly." The inaugural issue of the journal was published on June 1. In terms of layout and content, the goal is to popularize. In the future, regarding the selection of materials, if it can be as popular as possible, so as to match the general level of scientific knowledge in China, and add more illustrations to supplement the lack of textual explanations. The journal is distributed by the China Science Company and is on sale in bookstores inside and outside the city.</p>
<p>Reading "The Second Generation" Scholar</p>
<p>Cui Wanqiu's work "The Second Generation" was published, reprinted, and reprinted again in Chongqing, and all copies were sold out. The New York Herald Tribune's editorial once wrote an article for evaluation, believing that during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, there were two valuable full-length novels, worthy of reading, one is "The Second Generation", and the other is Zhang Henshui's "The Great River Flows East".</p>
<p>The Shanghai version of "The Second Generation" has been added and deleted by Mr. Chu and published by Readers' Bookstore. The content is about the love story of a couple during the Battle of Xuzhou and the Battle of Wuhan. The Herald Tribune's evaluation of it is not comparable to ordinary love novels, castles in the air, focusing on business acumen, or novels suitable for low-level tastes. In a grim war atmosphere, it either uses its own life experience or depicts social forms, writing truthfully. If it is not based on facts, how can it be so realistic.</p>
<p>When I read "The Second Generation", from the author's plain narration, the aura of Miss Hua Xihua's charming, wisdom, and the innate feminine beauty of a maiden spirit will immediately be reflected in my mind.</p>
<p>Liu Jianming's affair with Lei Dasheng is depicted with sadness, saying: The love between husband and wife is not absolute. If men and women are separated, it is easy to have problems. I understand this very well. However, she has only been separated from me for half a year, and it is not clear whether I am alive or dead, and she has already remarried. This inevitably makes people feel too cold. There are many men in the world, why not find someone else, but insist on finding my fellow countryman, my classmate, my colleague?" How can we bear to finish reading it? I cannot help but sympathize with him! Liu Jianming is an allegory of a very active section chief in the current Army Headquarters.</p>
<p>Others, such as the personality of the division commander Lin Wenhua, say that he is rough, straightforward and quick-witted, which is indeed the true character of a soldier, which shows the breadth of the author's life range.</p>
<p>The two characters in the so-called Low-Key Club, Zhu Fushan, refer to Zhou Fohai, and Meng Bowen, namely Hui Zhongming, are extremely obvious writing techniques. The Low-Key Club is a place that Miss Hua Xihua and others are unwilling to go. From the Low-Key Club, one can see what kind of people Zhu Fushan and Meng Bowen are. "The Second Generation" mainly writes about Ye Weiming and Zheng Xihua getting to know each other before the Anti-Japanese War and engaging in national salvation work after the Anti-Japanese War, which are mostly the author's actual life, so the writing is interesting and incisive. Ye Weiming traveled thousands of miles to the battlefield to see his lover, it is true: "A lover makes a fool turn into a genius." "Those who do not love money or beauty are fools."</p>

<h3>The Satire of the Food Department</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>After reading the official letter from the Jiangsu District Supervisory Commissioner's Office to the Executive Yuan for correcting the malpractice of grain loans, it is infuriating and heartbreaking!</p>
<p>All citizens of Shanghai should stand up and support Commissioner Cheng's case and demand that the government execute these corrupt officials who are derelict in their duties and disregard the lives of the people in order to uphold the law and punish corruption. Otherwise, this angry fire will make every citizen mad and will incite other unexpected events.</p>
<p>The government holds grain loans, originally to relieve the people's food, but now from the ten facts investigated and listed in the official letter from the Supervisory Commissioner's Office, grain is no different from exploiting citizens, increasing the burden on citizens, and letting a few grain officials make a fortune. We want to ask the government, is this the purpose? If not, what should be done with these corrupt officials? Let them wander overseas? Let them eat their fill of the people's blood and enjoy themselves there? To be honest, we believe that the government will definitely "use heavy penalties in troubled times, punish one to warn a hundred" for this shocking corruption case, because there is no reason for the government not to do so.</p>
<p>The social atmosphere has deteriorated to this point, and many people scold unscrupulous merchants. We admit that there are unscrupulous people among merchants, but why do they have the guts to commit fraud? Are they really not afraid of the law? From the grain loan case, we can believe that there is a group of corrupt officials colluding with them, supporting them, and giving them convenience to collude to exploit the common people.</p>
<p>Finally, we must all pay close attention to the development of this matter. The supernatural powers of this group of corrupt officials and unscrupulous merchants are quite small. They will use various methods to escape. If you don't believe it, on the same day that the Jiangsu District Supervisory Commissioner's Office announced the case, the Food Department issued a so-called "abolition of the Shanghai Grain Administration Office and the establishment of the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Office." It is still Director Yang Xizhi and Deputy Directors Ye Xinming and Wang Daren. It's just changing the soup but not the medicine. This is a smokescreen.</p>
<p>It seems that the Food Department is joking with the Jiangsu District Supervisory Commissioner's Office. We have such a feeling, but the Food Department is too majestic, because this kind of satire is unbearable for anyone.</p>
<h3>Preliminary to the Police District System</h3>
<p>— Jin Xie Shan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met a Mr. Hou, who works at the ×× district police station. We chatted about the police district system.</p>
<p>Mr. Hou is from Beiping (Beijing) and graduated from the Whampoa Military Academy. He has served in the police bureau for many years and has rich experience in both police science theory and practice. Our conversation began as follows:</p>
<p>"The term 'police district system' is really quite foreign to us," I started.</p>
<p>"No, this term has actually been around for a long time," he replied with interest. "It was implemented in Beiping for many years before the war and achieved very good results. The police and the people became one, truly achieving a harmonious atmosphere. Anyone who saw it would feel a sense of peace and happiness."</p>
<p>"Oh, but why must police visits be conducted in the evening? This seems to greatly disrupt the peaceful lives of citizens!" I asked curiously.</p>
<p>"That's all just disruptive propaganda," he said. "The anxiety that the police district system causes among the general public is caused by these absurd rumors. Why would visits have to be in the middle of the night? Such rumors are clearly self-defeating. Unless there is a specific incident, it would never happen! As for the way visits were conducted in Beiping in the past, it was not like what people imagine today, where the police bureau would bring a team of people, knock on doors in a pompous manner, and ask questions incessantly, which is annoying. Instead, it was done in a more intentional and unintentional way." He paused for a moment and then said:</p>
<p>"For example, if a police officer wants to visit a certain resident, he can choose a time when Mr. × is free or when he is strolling along the road. Then, the police officer can chat with the person he wants to visit in various different and natural ways, without making him feel bothered at all. Over time, they might even become good friends. The police officer can casually enter the resident's home – like visiting an old friend – to rest or have a cup of tea and be welcomed. The resident can also casually enter the police bureau, nod his head, and borrow the phone. This is very convenient for everyone. The impression that citizens of Beiping had of the police bureau was never like the reaction of citizens in Shanghai today, who feel fear at the mention of the police bureau. This can be said to be a side effect of the implementation of the police district system. Because only in this way can the police and the people achieve true cooperation."</p>
<p>"So what exactly is the purpose of implementing the police district system?" I asked again.</p>
<p>"Regarding this question, the general public thinks that the responsibility of police officers is to catch criminals, which is of course a necessary responsibility. However, the highest goal of the police bureau is not to consider catching people as the only ultimate responsibility. The best and most perfect police administration should prevent the occurrence of crime. The police district system largely adds such a goal to its purpose. Because the people can live and work in peace and contentment only when unfortunate things do not happen. Otherwise, even if the police bureau helps solve the case after something happens, it is still not a peaceful experience. Therefore, preventing the occurrence of crime is the highest task of the police bureau. The implementation of the police district system will carry out this task, clearly understanding the living conditions of the general public and the whereabouts of petty criminals. I ask, where can petty criminals use their skills under vigilant surveillance? The peace and contentment of the people will then be guaranteed!"</p>
<p>"Will the police district system also assist in political work?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That will never happen. The police district system is entirely for preventing petty criminals from causing trouble. Politics is politics, and police affairs are police affairs; this is very clearly separated. If this causes anxiety for some people, it is completely unnecessary!"</p>
<p>This conversation gave me a new understanding of the police district system and also dispelled the more or less negative impressions that I had picked up from some newspaper propaganda.</p>

<h3>Japanese Prisoner Slogan: Wolfish Ambitions</h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>I recently received the May 18th Guilin Guangxi Daily. Although there were only a few advertisements on the first advertisement page, one can imagine a glimpse of the cityscape of Guilin. On Zhengyang Road, there is the Xijing Theater, performing excellent dramas day and night, and promoting itself with "comfortable seats and refreshing air." On Lequn Road, there is the Samsung Chang Cinema, which is currently showing "Earth Roars." In addition, there is the Qunzhong Grand Theater, performing scene dramas. On the other hand, the Guilin Police Bureau and the Guangxi University school buildings are currently open for bidding for construction.</p>
<p>The trend of organizing "parties" in Chongqing is very strong. Two new "parties" have emerged: one is called the "Sworn Brotherhood Party," with hundreds of members, and the other is called the "Loyalty and Righteousness Party," also with hundreds of members. Both "parties" are currently very active, but it is said that their organization is based on "gangs" and "associations."</p>
<p>Beiping journalists Cheng Shewo, Zhang Henshui, etc., have recently suggested that the Central News Agency send out telegrams daily, ending by 11 PM so that colleagues working at night have the opportunity to go to bed.</p>
<p>After the victory, all of the Fujian Xiamen University school buildings were occupied by Japanese prisoners. After they were sent away, there was only a dilapidated house left, with walls covered in their slogans. One of them was particularly startling: "We will be back in twenty years..."</p>
<p>A principal in Chongqing said to his students: "This semester, the students who live here pay a total of 88,000 yuan for both accommodation and meals. That's an average of only 628.5 yuan per person per day. We have provided you with very comfortable dormitories and classrooms. You eat three full meals a day, and I have hired so many teachers to teach you. Go ask the people at the inns how much it costs per night!"</p>
<p>Guangzhou is trying traitors. Last month, it publicly tried "Market Bridge Emperor" Li Fuqun. When he was brought in for questioning, the traitor Li was short and fat, looking exactly like a pig. He was originally a "Dan household" (boat dweller) and had no knowledge. He didn't even know whether to write his own name from the beginning or the end. But his "puppet government" luck was very good. He was promoted and ennobled, and in a few years, he became a "lieutenant general." Therefore, he often made big jokes. Once, when introducing his "staff" to a friend, he said, "That's my lower part." His friend almost couldn't help but laugh, and the "staff" felt even more embarrassed.</p>
<p>According to a Chengdu newspaper, Xu's wife, a resident of Jiaotong Street in Hechuan, Sichuan, had four breasts. Recently, after giving birth, she had abundant milk and nursed people, which was discovered by neighbors on the street. In addition to the two breasts on her chest, she also had two breasts in each armpit. Their shape was slightly smaller than the ones on her chest, and the milk was the same as the two breasts on her chest. Xu's family is poor and is willing to be hired as a wet nurse.</p>
<h3>The Life of a "White Tiger"</h3>
<p>— Huang Quan</p>
<p>People call us "boys" or "waiters," but we call ourselves "white uniforms." Every day, we work more than twelve hours in restaurants, tea houses, and cafes.</p>
<p>We arrive at the service place at 9 AM, report for duty, and receive instructions from the foreman to mop the floors, wipe the tables and chairs, and clean the silverware, soy sauce bottles, cups, and saucers until around 11 AM, when we all eat lunch. After lunch, we start business. Customers come in to eat Western food, Chinese food, coffee, tea, and snacks, non-stop. Each person is assigned a certain number of tables to serve, from serving tea and setting the table to finishing the meal. During this time, we have to ask what they want to eat, how many guests there are, light their matches, hand them towels, and take their coats and hats. We treat customers with absolute kindness and thoughtfulness because customers are our breadwinners. Under the foreman's supervision, we cannot leave for a moment, standing like this hour after hour until we get off work late at night and rush home before curfew.</p>
<p>When business is good, we are so busy that we can't breathe. If we make an occasional mistake, the customer skips the bill, or we send the wrong food, we are unlucky if the customer has a bad temper. We swallow our anger. When business is slow, we chat with regular customers and joke with colleagues, so we see and hear a lot. No one can hide their secrets, and male and female colleagues are even so frank that they are almost vulgar. It is easy to fall in love, get up early in the morning, and go home together at night, which is an opportunity.</p>
<p>Work is always unevenly distributed between joy and suffering. We wear white clothes all year round, a uniform. It's cold in the winter and hot in the summer. We can't sit down even when our legs are sore. We only have three or four hours of time off each week, and it's easy to get sick coming home late at night. What's interesting is watching the nouveau riche eat Western food, flustered and awkward, the embarrassment of empty-headed young masters who can't pay the bill, and the ugly appearance of old but not dead philandering men flattering women. The mischievous ones give stale snacks and dishes to customers and "foreign devils," but they secretly replace the good ones and take them home for breakfast. When the customers are all gone around 11 PM, we sit down in rows and listen to the "foreign devils" play music. They can't rest until the hour is up, which is really infuriating.</p>
<p>The income of the "white uniforms" depends entirely on 20% of the tip money on the table and other rewards. Each month, it is divided according to the percentage, with the manager and others taking 2%. Ordinary workers now get a little over 100,000 yuan per month, but the regular salary is only 3,000 yuan. So it all depends on how the business is or finding extra money, otherwise, they can't support their families.</p>
<p>Because of the long working hours, we rarely see the sun every day, lack exercise, and work too hard, so most of us are not healthy and are more likely to get lung disease. After working for five years since leaving school, I feel that I have forgotten all my knowledge, and the monotonous work has extinguished the sadness of my youthful ambitions.</p>
<p>A Few Words</p>
<h3>Women's Hair Styles Uniformly Required by Government?</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>The first bad impression I had after returning to Shanghai was that many people urinate by the feet of walls on busy roads, which has almost become a public toilet, and the ground is full of flows. Pedestrians cover their noses and pass by. It is not only unhygienic but also extremely inelegant. One can infer the so-called municipal administration under the enemy's occupation.</p>
<p>Opening an old newspaper from twenty years ago, there were habitual phrases "with torches and staffs" and "whistling and escaping" used in news of petty theft, which feels ridiculous. In fact, one or two thugs broke into a room to rob, "with staffs" may be the case, but "with torches" seems an exaggeration; "whistling and escaping" is even more absurd. It's better to say "pull out a pistol to shut up..." Although it has become a cliché, it is still relatively reasonable.</p>
<p>It is said that the staff of the Housing Allocation Committee often found vacant houses when they recently set out to investigate the houses left by Japanese expatriates, but in a blink of an eye, they were occupied by people who moved in, and the purpose of these occupants was mostly not to live in themselves, but to resell them and profit from them, making it even more difficult for those who really had no houses to live in to find a house. After Mayor Wu took office, he made his best efforts to suppress the price of rice and eliminate labor unrest. After many unscrupulous rice merchants were arrested, the rice market has indeed stabilized a lot; I hope that the same strict measures will be taken to solve the housing shortage problem, punishing one to warn a hundred, now is the time.</p>
<p>In several newspapers, the "杰" character of Foreign Minister Wang Shijie has an extra dot in the upper right corner, which becomes the "杰" character, as if to specially point out the heaviness of the burden on the foreign minister's shoulders.</p>
<p>A senior officer in a certain US military agency stationed in Shanghai asked his Chinese female staff, saying "The hair styles of Chinese women in general have little difference, is it stipulated by the government". Roughly, foreigners see too few "uniform" things in our country, if any, it is on women's heads.</p>
<h3>Fundraiser</h3>
<p>— Jin Guang</p>
<p>A well-dressed female student was using fluent eloquence to solicit donations from a middle-aged pedestrian, and the pedestrian stared at the female student's hand for a long time and said, "Miss, can you take off the two gold rings on your finger to help your teachers?"</p>
<h3>Buying Popsicles</h3>
<p>— Jin Yang</p>
<p>The early summer sun hung high in the sky, hot!</p>
<p>The child selling popsicles was carrying a wooden box, walking quickly along the foot of the wall, shouting:</p>
<p>"Beauty Brand Popsicles, Beauty Brand Ice Cream!"...</p>
<p>"Beauty Brand Popsicles,..."</p>
<p>At this time, a boy of eight or nine years old came out of the alley, he pulled his mother and said "Mom, buy me a popsicle to eat!" She (his mother) shook her head and said: "Baby, popsicles are not delicious, eating them will give you a stomach ache! Tomorrow I..."</p>
<p>"No, popsicles are delicious, they all eat them at school, buy me one to eat!" the child pleaded.</p>
<p>"I'll buy you chocolate candy tomorrow! Chocolate candy is really delicious, baby be good!" she wanted to deceive him, but she had no money to buy chocolate candy.</p>
<p>"Don't want to eat chocolate candy, want to eat popsicle!"</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>She finally agreed to him after several requests from him.</p>
<p>"Buy popsicle, how much money?" The popsicle seller stopped his footsteps in time and said, "Popsicles are two hundred and fifty yuan, ice cream is six hundred yuan!"</p>
<p>Hearing this answer, she looked at her son thoughtfully, and he seemed to understand something and remained silent.</p>
<p>"You buy?" The popsicle seller asked impatiently.</p>
<p>"Mom" the child called out affectionately to his mother.</p>
<p>"No need!"——"No, I want to eat!"</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, she finally took out two hundred and fifty yuan to buy one. When the child got the popsicle, he smiled understandingly.</p>
<p>The child selling popsicles raised his voice again, shouting triumphantly: "Beauty Brand Popsicles!..."</p>
<p>He smiled again when he heard this shout, but she was estimating: "Another quarter of the day's salary is gone!"</p>
<h3>Social Service: Answering Readers' Questions</h3>
<p>Legal Inquiries</p>
<p>(1) Wu Xianhou asks: After the August 13th Incident in the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic of China, 1937], the enemy army attacked the capital, and the National Army retreated. In March of the following year, a large army gathered in Fanchang. At that time, there was a shortage of military food. Wang Bingcheng, the director of the Fanchang County Granary Management Committee, issued a note to me to borrow 1,000 dan of grain to provide military food. Unexpectedly, the National Army abandoned Fanchang that year. It was not until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War last year that the county government was restored to its original state. This January, I submitted a document to the Finance and Grain Department of the county government (the County Granary Management Committee was abolished) requesting repayment. It has been several months, and they have ignored it. I am deeply resentful. May I ask: 1. Is the IOU valid? 2. If it is valid, which agency should I request repayment from? 3. What kind of procedures should be used to request repayment? 4. The county granary director has now died of illness, but the party affairs committee members Yao Shiyu and Du Xuebin still live in the same place. (These three are all wealthy local gentry).</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers]: (1) If it was issued by a legitimate agency, it should be valid. (2) Find the agency in charge of grain storage in each district. (3) In your written request, the amount should be deducted from the county granary grain to be paid. (4) You can ask them to assist in the reconciliation.</p>
<p>(2) Huang Xiuzhu asks: My wife's special real estate, which was allocated by her parents at the time, invited relatives to make a note. When the note was issued, it was recovered from the eldest sister-in-law, and after the receipt was issued and then given to the eldest sister-in-law, it was deposited with relatives by the wife. Now that the wife has died, the bloodline inheritance only has the right to fully recover from the mother's family brother and sister-in-law. I don't understand the law, and I only have a photo of the note. Please, sir, explain the law in detail and reply!</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers]: (A) The wife's death, the wife's original property belongs to the wife's heirs, so if the wife dies without children, then the wife's special property, by her parents, or her brothers and sisters, (if her parents are both dead) and her husband each gets one-half, the mother's family brother and sister-in-law do not have the right to fully recover. (B) The difference between a written note and a photo, one is the original, and the other is a copy. The former has stronger evidentiary power than the latter. When a lawsuit occurs, the party who uses the content of the document as a method of proof should present the original. If the original is not presented or cannot be presented, the court makes its own judgment about the evidentiary power.</p>
<p>(3) Zhou Shihua asks: My late husband and his brother entered a stone-gate [Shikumen] room for a share, each contributing half. Now that my husband is dead, his father has a written note, giving me ownership of half of the share. Now, because my father and brother do not provide for me, and I have financial difficulties, I want to rent out my half of the share to others, but his son objects unreasonably. Can I file a legal lawsuit? I sincerely ask the jurist of your column to instruct me.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers]: "Entering for a share" is probably rough. If so, then renting a house does not mean acquiring ownership and cannot be arbitrarily transferred. If there is an agreement that "the tenant shall not sublet the leased property to others without the consent of the landlord", the landlord may terminate the contract and take back the house if the tenant violates the agreement, even if there is no agreement, only the tenant may sublet part of it to others. If the city room is the brother of the husband, the daughter-in-law of his deceased brother cannot rent out half of the share to others.</p>
