<h3>咬文嚼字代表爭辯多　——憲草審委會旁聽側寫</h3>
<p>— 本報記者</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕第一審委會開會時，仍不乏咬文嚼字現象，與會者往往爲爭一字一句，而翻覆爭辯，爭論最烈者，爲「前言」中用「依據遺教」抑「遵照遺敎」第一條應否加「民主」二字，尤以後者爭辯極烈。陳願遠力主第一條應改爲「中華民國爲三民主義民主共和國」，並謂「余今日與會即爲爭民主兩字而來」，且說明民生主義即經濟的民主。任車宣亦起而解釋，狄膺不耐細聽，速呼「鈴已　了兩次，不要再往下說了。」皮以書等反對加「民主」兩字，認增加後無異「盡蛇添足」。張知本認第一條加「民治民有民享」等外國名詞後，等於以「洋貨抵制國貨」。另一代，表亦謂：「大國有者我不「定非有不可，外國無者，我何以不可獨創。」</p>
<p>第一審委會開會時，曾兩度停電，代表於黑暗中發言，聞其聲不見其人，情形與停電時之電影院相彷彿，靑年黨與民社黨代表於第一審委會中發言極踴躍。余家菊，閔達，夏爾康，周寶三等，皆曾發言，說明各該黨對憲草之意見，並作若干讓步。會　主席李俊夫，亦爲民社黨員之一，李俊夫因若干代表對其指責幾憤而退席，後由黃少谷，陳逸雲等勸止。今　會塲情形確相當熱烈，往往同時有五六百人請求發言，口呼席次號碼，熟鬧有似上海拍賣行，若無黃少谷之冷靜分析，秩序幾無法維持。</p>
<p>第一條提付表決時，由主席李俊夫宣讀各項提案，惟愈念愈輕，代表粉提反對，李謂：「余聲嘶力竭，聲音已經沒有了。」惟至最後聲調又漸變高，某代表於會場中講一故事稱：「張宗昌當年曾提倡四民主義以對抗三民生義，其所謂四民主義即士·農·工·商四民」，說畢衆咸大笑。</p>
<p>第三審委會由王世杰主席，因爲召集人潘公展等的準備工作作得周密完備，王主席處理得有條不紊，會議進行十分順利，一條一條和衷共濟地討論下去，表決下去，一點沒有耽擱時間和爭得窮凶極惡的情形，可以說是最合理的審查會。</p>
<p>西伯里亞的寒流又來了，早晨夜晚發在地下的水都結了冰，每一個會塲裏都生了火，走進去眞覺溫暖如春，只是大會會塲裏旣未生火，也沒水汀，上午在裏面開會的第二審委會，很快就結束了。下午在裏面開會的第七審委會教育文化小組，也覺冷冷淸淸，一個提案一個提案交代過去，少有熱烈的場面。</p>
<p>第七審委會國防外交小組，在上午的會議中，賀國光和冷欣爲了軍人是否可加入政黨一點，「鬥爭」頗烈。賀說：「軍隊是國家的軍人，旣不能干預行政，自應超出然派。」冷說：「軍人也是國民，應該享有信仰主義的自由和行使政權的權利。」爭論結果，第一三四條前半並無更改，賀勝利了。</p>
<p>國防外交小組午後討論憲草修正案第一三七條外交政策時，兩位天主敎大亨于斌，潘朝英大出風頭，滿腔宗敎家熟忱的干斌，一方爲國際道義呼籲，反對權術的運用，一方爲二千萬僑胞請命，要求明列保僑的條文。國際問題學者的潘朝英，要求關於聯合國憲章一項，不必在我國憲法中作硬性的規定，以免因國際法的修改變動，多招致憲法修訂的麻煩，結果雨人的目的全部達到·</p>

<h3>美國對華政策協會嚴詞譴責范宣德致函貝爾納斯要求否認范氏聲明對顧大使失禮應予道歉</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約九日電〕美國對華政策協會，（主席爲飽威爾）今日公佈該恊於六日致貝爾納斯書之全文，要求國務院否認國務院遠東司司長范宣德在十一月十一日所發表有關中國之聲明，並對范氏對顧維鈞失禮一事，亦應予以道歡。該函稱：「范宣德謂吾人若以公私資本投資於官商腐敗之國家或其政府，以資源浪費過度於武備上之國家，或有內戰威脅之國家，或政府有意專制而欲拒美商於外之國家，或毫無民主思想之國家，則僉信此誠爲不智之舉」！「此種諷刺，今日大部盼可適用於全球各國」。「然范宣德之聲明，僅指明一國，即中國是也」·一然尙有更當予以譴責之事，蓋范氏發表此項聲明時，中國駐美大使羅維鈞亦在座，顧氏不便當場反駁，故採取顯然不予答覆之容智態度，此誠非良善之之美國外交政策，亦非美國對待友好國家代表之傳統禮節」。范氏對中國共黨之同情及其聲明，恰與共黨報紙所陳述之政策完全相合，乃顯而易見者。范氏或希望美國停止對中國政府之一切貸款，此點吾人殊可瞭解，然當國務院宣佈其政策及爲與各盟國合作時，范氏居然以代表國務院發表此項聲明，此吾人成不能瞭解。范氏之聲明，勢將協助製造中國之混亂局面。更有甚者，此項聲明，將使美國永遠不能貸款予違反蘇聯政策究任何國家矣。蓋此種國家中之共產黨，永能製造　范氏所稱之局面也。如　敗內戰，工業國有國度軍費等，若吾人接受此種原則，則勢必除爲蘇聯所讚許之國家外，不能貸款與任何國家矣，甚至不能貸款與菲律賓。該恊會在九月六日致杜魯門總統書中，曾要求「改組國務院遠東司，並由完全符合美國之門戶開放政策者，擔任該司各重要職務。」該協會直率向貝爾納斯稱：「范氏初任中國科科長後，升任遠東司司長，吾人對其作長期觀察，已使吾人確信渠並無上述資格。」該文結論稱：「吾人僅要求閣下（指貝氏）公開產明，否認范氏之聲明，並向范氏對顧鈞失禮一事，予以道歉。」</p>

<h3>憲草中有關選舉諸問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　俞振基</p>
<p>國代提分大表案析</p>
<p>國大代表此次所提書面提案，總數約達四百件，其中一至一百案巳由大會秘書處印發，茲就此一百案中有關選舉之廿四個提案略加分析，以見國大代表對憲法有關選舉規定之希望。</p>
<p>各代表最所重視之選舉問題，有：（一）職業選舉制，（二）區城代表制中增加邊疆代表名額，（三）婦女選舉與被選舉，（四）華僑選舉監委等四問題。多數代表咸盼上述四點在憲法中能有明文規定，以合世界潮流。常然，對上述諸點，亦有表示異議者，然爲數究不甚多。</p>
<p>（一）職業代表制</p>
<p>主張職業代表制最力者爲谷正綱，馬超俊，及王曉籟等五百廿八代表所提之第九十八案，該案舉出下列理由，說明兼採職業選舉制之必要：（一）職業代表來自社會各階層，足以代表各職業組織之利益，且有超地方性之意識；（二）區域代表與職業代表分別選舉後，最能代表職業意識之人士，即易爲各同業選出：　（三）集全國不同職業之代表於一堂，易收協調之效。並舉出十三年國父北上時，即主張關國民會議，應採職集代表制；廿年正式召集時，即遵照此次主張，由全國職業團體分別選出代表，參加制定訓政時的法，現行國民大會代表選舉法縣市參議會組織及選舉條例縣參議員選舉條例，均兼採職業選舉制，根據過去經騐，實施此制，有利而無弊。</p>
<p>自瑞等二百十八代表所提「國大準備會憲草研究會中華民國憲草修正案」案中，亦主兼採職業代表制。</p>
<p>綜觀一百提案中，提及職業者有八案，其中七案贊成此一制度，提案人多至九百七十四人（其間不無重複者），佔代表總額二分之一，而提案人谷正綱，馬超俊爲負責指導晨工商職業團體之黨政機關主管，王曉　等又爲全國商聯會理事長，其他代表亦多爲國大職業代表，故可代表全體農工商之意見與要求，其他區域代表亦多簽名贊同者，衆償此一要求，必可實現。</p>
<p>唯一反對者爲王宣等廿九代表所提之第八十七案，該案主張國大代表只分區域代表與僑民代表，蓋上述兩種代表已包括全民，且符合由自治單位選舉代表以組織國民大會之遺敎。彼等認職業代表實不見於關於國民大會之遺敎，民十三所主張開國民大會係另一件事。　此次所發表之一百個提案中，涉及邊疆代表名額問題者有五案，其中最重要爲（一）白雲梯等二二二代表所提第十八案，（二）黃正淸等六十二代表所提八十九案，及（三）楊砥中等二十代表所提第五十九案。白雲梯黃正淸等提案，係爲　藏呼籲，楊種中則爲代各省土著民族提出要求。</p>
<p>白　梯等之提案，認國大。立法與監察三　中，雖列有蒙古條款，然多有失漏，未盡適宜，應予補訂。關於選舉份部，主張第廿六條在「一，由各省區及蒙古各盟」之下，加「部特別旂」四字；在「二，由各省參議會及蒙古各盟」下，加「部特別旂」四字；在「三，由各縣之」下，加一「旂」字；「及相當於縣」五字，改爲「及其相當」四字。其理由因各盟部特別旂之面積均相當於省，各旂之面積均相當於縣·</p>
<p>立法委員原定爲「蒙古各盟共八人」，白等則主張改爲「蒙古各盟部及特別旂共卅人」，其理由爲盟部收目共十三個，此爲當有不屬盟部之特別旂，各盟部之面積均甚大，如定爲八人，則每盟部不及一人，實織過少，再者盟部與省之地位相同，人口最少之省尙有立委五人，盟旂立委總數增爲卅人，並不爲多。監委數亦主由八人增至十七人。</p>
<p>黃正淸等之提案，擬請於憲法中明確規定省屬藏故應選出之國大代表及立委監委。主張於憲草第廿六條各款「西藏」之下加「及省屬藏族區域」等字。立委於原有西藏八人外，增加「省屬藏族八人」，監委亦增八人。</p>
<p>其理由爲普通所指「西藏地方」‘係指前後藏而言，低實際上如甘·川·靑·康·滇各省區內均有聚居一定地方之藏族，合計人口當有三百萬人以上，而此等藏民區，現未能容於所謂西藏地方，而在各省區內之選舉及選舉權，憲草中又無明文規定，因有此一提議。　與此案性質相似之另一案，爲楊砥中等廿人之提案，建議由滇。川。黔。康。湘。桂六省土著民族，按人口數字比例，配選國大代表與立委監委等。</p>
<p>關於白雲梯等之提案察·綏·寗等省代表，認目前上述各省對蒙胞相當優待，似不應別有規定。（未完）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>請勿關閉和談之門！</h3>
<p>自國民大會開會制憲以來，國人雖然竭誠期望國大能制定一部切實可行的民主憲法，爲我國民主法治奠定一個鞏固的始基；但是仍迫切盼望國共雙方能够重開和談，使這一邊在開會制憲而另一邊在打仗流血的特殊現象，早日吿終，而獲得眞正的和平解決。所以我們老百姓，在國民大會開幕之後，對於和談的重開，仍抱着一顆迫切期待的心，尤其對於調人馬歇爾特使的平津之行，無時不予以密切的注視。因爲調人馬帥對於調處國共問題，秉有百折小撓的決心，當中共代表周恩來離京遄返延安之時，曾有切實具體的意見，請其轉達延安當局，以試探和談有無重開的可能。馬帥抱着絕大的忍耐，等待中共答復，一直等到前幾天，始接獲周恩來的答覆。覆文的內容非常簡單，中共提了重開和談的兩項先決條件：一爲解散正在開會制憲的國民大會，二爲恢復本年一月十三日頒佈停戰命令時雙方駐軍的位置。</p>
<p>馬帥接到了這個答覆之後，同然認爲重開和談的可能性微乎其微，就是在我們一般老百姓看來，也知道中共對於重開和談，旣缺乏誠意，政府對於中共所提兩項條件，自無予以接受的餘地，所以大家都感覺得極大的失望，而認爲中共已決定軍事奮門到底，似乎不怕任何犧性，這種勇於內鬥的精神，勇則勇矣，但是我們老百姓已經過二十年的流血，怎能忍受這慕大悲劇的演出呢！所幸政府仍本其一貫的主張，本月九日蔣主席在國府紀念週上報吿，除了表示中共所提出的兩項條件不能接受而外，並鄭重聲明：『政府始終未關閉和談之門，一貫主張政治解決國內問題，等待中共隨時參加和談及改組政府』。這一番話，不啻是和平的福音，使我們對於和談重開的前途，又燃起一綫希望。政府旣竭誠希望和平，始終主張政治解決國內問題，對於國事必能獲得和平解決，實在是一個最有力的保障。同時又據外交部發言人表示，政府刻正在考慮一項計劃，擬派遣要員前往延安一行，爲國內和平作最後一次的努力；而要員人選以張羣·王世杰·邵力子三氏的呼聲最高。這個計劃，如果不爲中共所反對，而能實現；則對於和談的重開，當有極大的裨益，而可目爲停頓已久的和談之轉捩點。所以全國的老百姓都翹首南京，引領切望這個計劃的實現。</p>
<p>但是中共對於這個計劃的態度如何？起初保持緘默，拒不加以評論，僅於前天深夜，突然向報界發表國軍開始進攻延安區的消息，並强調胡宗南將軍所部國軍六團已深入「甘陝寗邊區」三十里，而稱此爲進攻延安區規模最大的攻勢。中共發言人王炳南發表這個驚人的消息，究其用意，不外乎要使我們老百姓對於重開和談，勿再痴心想望。到了昨天·王炳南又發言了，他說政府派員前往延安的計劃，是政府所採取的一種『和平攻勢』。延安決不能表示同意。準此而論，，政府雖將和談之門洞開，隨時準備與中共重開和談；但是中共却又把和談之門關閉了。</p>
<p>所以我們老百姓對於和談不能重開的癓結，不能不認淸，這個責任應由中共負之，也是不言可喻的。所貴乎第三方面者，乃在其能超脫一切黨派的私見，而一秉其大公無私的精神，對於是非，看得分明；對於黑白，辨得淸楚，故對於目前和談的不能重開的責任問題，實在不容模稜兩可；而有查明的必要。</p>
<p>我們雖然沒有親自經歷政黨政治的經驗；但是還有目擊民主先進國家政治演變的見識；我們終覺得中國共產黨，非民主先進國的普通政黨所可比擬。在民主先進的國家，任何政黨的競爭、，均以其對內對外的政策相號召。我們從來沒有聽見中共明白宣佈其政策，而其斤斤是爭的，都是地盤問題。我們願向中共說幾句老實話：時至今日，全國的老百姓莫不渴望和乎與民主。國民大會的任務，乃在制定一部切實可行的民主憲法，而沒有其他任何作用；現在出席的，除了國民黨而外，還有社會賢達，靑年黨及民主社會黨，這是我國走向民主法治的第一步，而且也是不可缺少的第一，步，中共要求解散國民大會，不僅絕無理由可言，而且違背了全國人民渴望民主的公意。此其一。人民爲了國內和平的實現，不得不日夜蔪求和談的重開，但是對於任何一黨的地盤問題，均非我們老百姓所關切的，以此爲重開和談的條件，此我們人民看來，也沒有充分的理由，此其二。中共一邊在宣傳，宣稱國軍已開始進攻延安區；但是在另一邊，共軍却在各綫發動攻勢，不僅榆林被共軍包圍，而且保定也成了危城，東北共軍在冰天雪地之中，也非常活躍。所謂事實勝於雄辯，世人對於中共的宣傳攻勢，萬難置信，此其三。</p>
<p>要之，事到如今，我們還是痴心想望，終希望國共雙方均能放下槍砲，停止打仗流血，而能重開和談，使國內問題獲得政治解決。我們老百姓實在太渴望和平了。尤其在現行環境之下，不論爲人民計或爲國家計，都是不容許內亂再起的，所以我們不得不主張和平第一，不究旣往，不講收穫，祇要國共能重開和談，我們終不表示絕望，深信人類的良知與常識，必能獲得勝利。但願雙方的領袖，均能痛不決心，善用其智慧，尤其是中共，勿關閉和談之門，務使國內化干戈爲玉帛，替國家民族留下一錢生機。</p>

<h3>黃岩蜜桔應時上市　桔園一望無際年產六千萬斤最先運銷來滬的是天臺山農</h3>
<p>— 臺州訊·本報通訊員沈波</p>
<p>台州唯一的農村特產之黃岩蜜桔，現在應時上市了，因爲黃岩出產的蜜桔，氣味甘天芳香，的確是果品中的佳者，所以遠近馳名。記者爲了明瞭黃岩結桔業的情形，特自台州乘着江大輪船，到了黃岩縣城，在輸船駛進三江悶的時候，便看見兩岸碧綠的桔樹上，滿掛着金黃色的桔子，連綿數十里，一望無際，這是天然景色的桔園書。</p>
<p>據一位許姓的桔商說，黃岩蜜桔販運到上海的第一個人，是書法家劉文玠先生（號天台山農），當時因蜜桔初次運到上海，一時不能　售，爲了要脫銷緣故，於是異想天開，把天台名山來利用作桔名，呌做「天台蜜桔」，桔樹是栽植在華項山高峯上的云云，可是不久黃岩蜜桔在海上就漸漸風行，頗爲暢銷，所以一直到現在，有許多的桔商還沿用着這「天台蜜桔」，作爲暢銷的老牌子。</p>
<p>全縣種植桔樹的面積，約有一萬三千畝左右，種桔的農戶，有一萬三千八百多家，種植的田畝的有五萬多畝，栽植桔樹數在一百五十多萬株，每年產量在六千萬斤以上，其中以早桔佔全縣桔產額百分之七十多，朱紅桔佔全產額百分之二十，全縣的農產物，除了稻穀之外，就要算着桔業，每年收人數目頗爲鉅大，臺州農村的經濟亦頓以週轉　活。令年夏秋時候，雖然遭受了旱風災的打擊，但桔子的產量并不歉收，現在早桔開市，每百斤七萬多元，然因銷路不振，價目漸漸下降至六萬元左右。</p>
<p>種植桔類有十餘種，茲將較爲多產的六種簡略介紹如下：</p>
<p>（一）早桔即市上所稱的蜜桔，果皮色黃，氣味芬芳，個子較大，成熟最早，在九十月間採食，是桔中發育嬝早的一種·</p>
<p>（二）本地早果皮亦呈黃色，較早爲粗厚，味甚甘美，且多液汁，爲桔中最優良的一種，而上海呌做「天台蜜桔」，就是這種佳果，且能久儲不爛，在十一十二月間成熟。</p>
<p>（三）乳桔是桔中的少女，果實較早桔爲小，皮薄而富有光澤，味淸甘美，果皮具有特殊的香氣。</p>
<p>（四）朱紅皮原色紅，形狀大小不一，住極組糙，爲桔中的粗品，初摘時味甚酸，然不宜早吃，直等到新春正工月間，別種桔子開始發僵，朱紅的酸味反轉變爲甘美。</p>
<p>（五）　　果實較其他的桔爲大，皮厚粗，微苦帶酸，是桔類中成熟最遲的一種，頭等到十二月中旬方可採摘，藏至翌年二三月間，其味轉甘多汁。</p>
<p>（六）抱子桔即美國產的華盛頓臍橙，在民國初年由日亦輸運而來，核少汁多，味最甘美，品質較本地早爲佳。其餘尚有汕頭無核桔，柑，黃皮桔，福桔，金桔多種，但產量不多。</p>
<p>種植方法，在每年冬耕的時候，先將田中培土築墩，方圓四五尺，高二三尺，墩底埋填破缸片，以免桔樹根下伸深入土中，至翌年明春，移植苗木於墩上，經過施肥，灌溉，培土，除虫，剪枝以後，便能結果，如須桔樹健全，還得將所生的果實先期摘去，五使成熟，以免肥力分散，大概均須至第七年，始有收益。在每屆冬季時期，最好以河底淤泥培壅如培墾適宜的話，可以延至六七十年尚有佳果，不過每年施　，須視品種年齡而定，凡在初栽苗木，培應决數較多，每决分量須少，每月的二一次，至桔樹到結果時期，每年以二三次爲度。</p>
<p>黃岩蜜桔銷路很廣，大宗銷行爲上海，寗波，杭州，蘇州·南京，溫州，麗水，及長江沿岸一帶的各商埠。在抗戰時期，因爲交通的阻滯，桔業一落千丈，有許多桔農將種植的桔田國，紛紛改爲稻田，迨於去年抗戰勝利之後，滬台復航，輪船定期行駛其間，於是桔子得以暢銷外埠，因跟着百物的一高昂，一般桔商和桔農無不獲利數倍，笑逐顏開，對於裝遝出口，亦逐漸考究，爲進免中途被壓腐爛的緣故，現在都將簍裝改爲箱裝，所以年來的黃岩木板料銷耗，亦隨之增多了。</p>

<p>逕啓者：茲因國府業於本月四日公佈修正房捐條例，其第一條規定各市縣徽收房捐，依本條例之規定。第二條後段，規定除房　外，不得以其他任何名目徵收附加稅。捐第四條房捐捐率如左：一·營業用房屋出租者不得超過其全年租金百分之十，自用者不得超過其房屋現值千分之十二。住家用房屋出租者不得超過其全年租金百分之五，自用者不得超過其房屋現值千分之五等因。（餘從略）查現在本市財政局開微之房捐，共計算方法，係依服民國廿六年房租分爲甲乙丙三種加二千倍至一千倍計軍，總額加徽百分之廿，另加市政建設捐百分之廿，合計爲百分之四十，爲古今中外所未有之苛政。經由市民列舉理由，致函字林西報及大陸等報極力反對，有認爲此時市政反不若敵偽時期者，有認爲抽收苛捐與強暴搶奪無異者，有認抽收苛捐爲詐欺取財者，有認爲抽收苛捐與吮吸民脂民膏無異者，羣情憤激，表示民意，主張廳即改善，當爲讀者所共見。此際國府旣有明令規定捐率，上海市政府應即遵辦，對於未收之房捐，不應多過該房捐條例之限制數額，從而房捐市政建設捐繳款書，應即由財政局一律取銷。理合請求貴報將此函登載讀者擱內，俾眾週知，至紉公誼。（盧興源律師）</p>
<h3>憲法賦予國民健康</h3>
<p>編者先生：國大代表胡定安，注企張，伍智梅，胡宣明，過祖源，王子　陳繼先楊度普等提議，請於憲法基本國策內規定增進國民健康專條案，其內容頗有足取，據余所知，其條文爲「國家應積極推行公共衛生增進國民健康」。共（理由）則「竊維國民之健康，即國家富強之基礎。自歐戰後，世界各國，即多以保障人民健康之事項，列入憲法，蘇聯憲法第一百廿條第、一百廿二條即其最顯著者。第二次世界大戰爆發後，如美英法等國，更確認健康爲人生之財富富。國民健康，即國家之資源，以是大西洋憲章巾已有明文規定不虜匱乏之自由。而英國於本年三月間宣布之衛生法案，法國之新人權宣言，均已定爲憲法之專章。即最近日本之憲法，亦規定國民均有經營健康而文化的最低限度生活之權利。我國國民之健康，已不及若干國之水準，值茲建國之始，倘不確定增進國民健康之國策，則無論政治如何完善，祗以人力之未強，終難達建設經濟之目標。至保障國民健康，自必須厲行公共衛生，始足以達到保障人民健康之目的」云云。殊值谷方重視。願公諸報端一致主張。（讀者冷小源）</p>

<h3>四外長下屆會議明春在蘇京舉行莫少托夫對德國問題提具體建議</h3>
<p>〔本報紐約特派員十日專電〕四強外長頃已同意，下决外長會議定於明年三月十日起在莫斯科舉行，草擬對德和的，並准許各国新聞記者將會議情形自由報導。按蘇聯外長莫洛托夫曾於上星期要求下决外長會議在越斯科舉行，昨晚四強舉行會談時，美國務卿貝爾納斯對此建議表示同意，但首先詢間莫氏是祈准許新聞記者自由報導會議情形，莫氏答稱：願參照巴黎及紐約兩次外長會議先例，給予新聞界以同樣之便利。但關於貝爾納斯所提削減聯合國在歐洲之佔領軍及立即召開外决會議研究德國問題之計劃，莫氏擬將答復保留至週二提出。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約九日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯本日徇蘇外長莫洛托夫之要求，與其舉行會談歷一小時之久，據此問政治觀察家談稱：莫氏會提出芳干具體方案，以謀及早締結對德和平條約。同時官方宣佈：四外長巳決定下屆會議於明年三月十日在莫斯科舉行。四外長今晚之會議，討諭下屆莫斯科會議之程序，其中包括任命外長會議代表佈置莫斯科會議一項提議在內，英洛托夫反對此議，要求給予考慮之時間，但贊同四外長廠訓令其代表檢討議程中美法蘇三國所提之草約。法外决繆維爾利川此一時機，陳述法國方面對於若干點之見解。繆氏稱，法國希望德國邊界問題有先討論，但最後同意將柏林盟國管制委會之報吿首先加以考慮。繆氏並提議將美國提案中討論「未來德國臨時與永久政府」字樣，改爲「在四國管制下德國臨時的政治機構」，貝爾納斯表示同意。决即討論外長代表預備會議問題，莫洛托失表示反對，其理由謂在四強決定德國疆界之前，若由外次會議聽取歐洲若干國家之對德領土要求，或將引起德國之強烈反響。繆維爾最後說明法國對蕯爾問題之意見，但會中未加討論。四外長明日將再度會議，屆時莫洛托夫對外决代表會議一點，殆將作最後決定。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎九日電〕半官方面息，南外長西米克已請法國知照外長會議，南斯拉夫願參加下屆外長會議，就德奧問題之討論，蓋南國對德奧和的具有直接利害關係之國。西米克於十二月四日致法代表繆維爾之函中，曾力言南國對德奧和的經濟及土地條文之關切。</p>

<h3>聯大政治小組消除爭執普遍裁軍案草成印提案通國包含三點　裁軍管制機關離安理會獨立</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖九日電〕聯人政治委會裁軍提案審查委會，今日消除裁軍問題之爭執，實際上因將普遍裁軍方案起宣完成。此乃法國埃及與印度之勝利。各該國促成裁單方案中列入一條，規定關係各國駐軍自外國撤退討論裁軍步驟時，應考慮聯合國警衛軍問題。爭論之平息，由於下列兩層原因：（一）大會主席史巴克不耐繼續爭論，請各代表停止浪費時間於不相干之間題。（二）英代表蕭克洛斯要求各代表考慮報紙對於會議之批許，望各代表勿成爲笑柄。先是，會中對於法國及埃及提案，爭辯不決，最後乃併入印度提案，依巴西代表提議，分三部份付表決通過。第一部份稱，聯大會鑒於安全問題與裁軍問題密切相關，爰提議安理會盡力擴大憲章四十八條所規定國際警衛之應用。第二部份她議各國政府將共駐在非敵國領土內之軍除，實行漸進的與平衡的撤退。第三部份建議駐紮會員國境內之車隊，應及早撤退。此條係埃及提出，美國主張加以修正，規定依照現行條約，駐在國外之軍隊作爲例外，表決通過。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖九日電〕聯大會裁軍小組會今晚決議，負責監督國際裁軍之機關，當脫離安理會而獨立活動。蘇外决維辛斯基雖拒絕說明否決權不應用於該機關，但蘇外長莫洛托夫先已有所表示，謂否決權僅施用於安理會以內。</p>
<h3>政治小組否決對西絕交案　通國此修正案召回駐西使節</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖九日電〕聯大政治委會今日以廿七票對七票，通過比利時對西班牙間題之提案，十六票棄權。該案建議全體會員國立即自弗朗哥主持下之西班牙召回大使與公使，使館事務由代辦主持。在相當時期內，西班牙若尚未樹立民主政府，安理會當考慮進一步適常措置。此項提案不若小組會所擬者之激烈，小組會主張會員各國分別與弗朗哥絕交，於數分鐘前被二十票對二十票否決。又　國所提禁止聯合國向西班牙採糧一案則被否決。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社馬穗里十日電〕昨夜此間舉行示威運動，要求西班牙獨立，不受外國干涉。今日全國其他各地將舉行示威，預定之示威區域商店均將打烊，以防不測。今晨各報均在封面登載昨夜示威行動之消息，據稱，參加者達七十萬人之衆，會中對於聯台國之態度嚴厲抗議。但中立觀察家認爲參加人數過於誇大。</p>

<h3>史達林退居幕後蘇政策在蛻變中　最返曾對英美屢作讓步是否權宜之計尚難斷言</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約九日電〕蘇聯對美英政策近來已趨緩和，西方外交家認爲原因有四］其主要者則爲蘇聯領袖爲史達林不積極主政預爲之備。史達林是否已年老多病，不能勝任，外間傳說不一，惟史達林數月來退居幕後，由莫洛托夫及其他要人主持一切，則爲此間外交家所確知。因此可以一得一結論，即史達林娐使無病，一亦已成爲蘇聯共產生義之先知與哲學家，而不復爲日理萬幾之指導者矣。莫斯科政櫂已在轉移，換言之，蘇聯之對外問題如决第解決，則其國內問題亦必隨之易於處置。由英美外交家視之，蘇聯近在聯大及四國外長會議態度軟化，此實共主要動機。此外尚有三種原因：即（一）蘇聯對於美國保有原子彈，深爲關切，其最重要之外交但標，厥在設法加以禁用及受國際管理。（二）國內建設直接影響蘇聯極大部份之人民，常爲蘇聯常局所最關切，該國一方而因須自德國取得較多之賠償，一方面更須取得美國財政的及技術的援助，此須在更友好的國際關係中爲之。（三）歐洲及其他各國共黨在政治上之失敗，已使蘇聯當局感受數决嚴重之失望，例如東歐各國之選舉，共產雖有應聯軍警爲其後盾，仍未能操左券，即在法國亦未完全勝利。上述各種原因之外，美國外交政策之堅定，似亦不無相常影響。惟隊聯近來處處讓步，是否即爲其政策之眞正轉變，俾永與西方各國同舟共濟，即僅係一時權宜之計，用以渡過國內難關，此則尚待解答耳。</p>

<h3>珍珠港事變五週紀念世局依然動蕩　原子彈生物戰威脅和平人民戰爭恐怖仍未解除</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯自合衆社米勒原著</p>
<p>在這個遺　萬年的紀念日，珍珠港己經五週年的今天，戰爭依然是這個世界上最大的恐懼。和平對於許多人，總是那個老關調黨，像燐火似地若隱若現。</p>
<p>我們在歐洲作戰十九個月以上。在太平洋的戰爭，也有十六個月之久。</p>
<p>但是現在遺留下來的禍患趨勢，却是人類有史以來從未曾有過的那樣大。因爲在第二次世界大戰　產生了兩樣武器：原子彈和生物戰。據科學家說，它們能够使人類的文化毀滅。</p>
<p>新的恐怖</p>
<p>一種新的恐懼和原子炸彈在一九四五年八月六日和八日一同被帶到地球上，地點是在歲島和長崎。但是直到戰爭結束好幾個月以後，這個世界方纔開始知道另一外一個新的恐懼，生物戰爭，已經發展到怎樣的程度。</p>
<p>這種戰爭假使一旦完成而加以應用，死亡區域的大小將洲以計。在別的武器，包括原子作彈，殺傷性都還只是區域性的。　在對德日作殊死戰爭中會　聯合一致的國家問正在萌芽的恐懼和猜疑，給道些新武器生了根，並且助長了它們的發展。</p>
<p>同時大約戰事雖然巳經過去，小的戰事却依舊正在進行。在世界上的許多地方一九四五年五月八日和八月十四日到來的和平，看來非常不愉快，簡直不是和平那麼一回事。</p>
<p>大戰結束以來，巴勒斯坦和中國境內一直沒有和平過。</p>
<p>在希臘邊境山地上所流的鮮血，正和第二次世界大戰中任何一個戰塲上所流的一樣地紅。</p>
<p>和平以後在呂宋叢林中死去的游擊戰士們，正和死在巴丹半島和柯里幾多爾的菲律濱人同樣地已經死掉。</p>
<p>另一戰爭</p>
<p>即使在已經不再流血的國家裏，和平看來也似乎只是另外一種戰爭。我們目睹了美國國內的罷工風潮，歐洲各小國不自由的選舉，和意大利丹麥的飢饉和愁慘</p>
<p>發動戰爭的各個閱家　巳糾降伏其中日本曾在一九四一年十二月八日對美國珍珠港究成了駭人聽聞的偷襲，戰事於焉開始。</p>
<p>她的炸彈和魚雷幾乎毀減了美國的太平洋艦隊，因乃使後來馬來亞和新嘉坡，非律濱羣鳥和印度尼西亞，以及西南太平洋羣鳥無抵抗地克復成爲可能。</p>
<p>珍珠港事變以後經過三年八個月和七天的時間，日本終於被擊潰了。她的艦隊被炸沉，主要的城市遭受破壞是。廣島和長崎被一種開天闢地以來宇宙間從未有過的暴力搗得稀燜。</p>
<p>和平無望</p>
<p>穗國的投降較日本要早三月，緊跟着對德戰爭，產生了至今仍爲唯一實際的和平希望——聯合國機構。</p>
<p>但是大多數人心目中的這個希望現在已不如一九四五年夏天聯合國剛在舊金山誕生的時候那樣光明。同盟國的軍事佔領只有在日本一國中沒有大的亂子。</p>
<p>二次大戰中　　　　　　立　式和平的工　·　　　於致身於此的政治家們·　　　顯得太形艱巨。</p>
<p>聯合國目從　生以後，已　生過了一切嬰　的先天　　，　且也遭受到了　　小　的全部　難。</p>
<p>東方和西方盟國　幾乎不曾停止過的爭論似乎一旦時機要來，即將置聯合國於早夭之境。大國和小國間根源，巳深的爭數也折磨了它。由於貪婪，恐欋·和仇恨的沾染，聯合國常常呈現出一付垂死之相。</p>
<p>這些是否只是正常幼小者應有的疾病呢？聯合國是否終將成長到光彩的靑年期，讓我們看見它成年呢？人類的這項奮門現在還在進行之中。政治家說他相信自己能够使聯合國做出事情來。</p>
<p>在這事的另外一邊，我們則還有生物戰和原子彈所造成的絆馬索。（山風毓譯）</p>

<h3>人造雪試驗成功</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕中華自然科學社訊：美國科學家雪菲，最近於勝利克塔的飛機塲所完成之人造雪試騐，實爲人類征服自然之歷史進程中一大勝利。雪菲在通用電器公司之科學研究實騐室中，曾於過度冷却之濕空氣中，加入微粒之乾冰，即發現有雪花之存在。根據是項理論，雪菲乃於最近在勝利克塔的飛機塲舉行大規模之人造雲試騐，彼乘飛機高入雲際，以重的六磅之微粒乾教散佈天空，俄頃即見雲中雪份，因凝結發散之潛熱之作用而使雲層騷動，終至下雪。據雪菲氏稱：僅需一微粒乾冰於下落二千呎後即可降雪數噸之多。</p>
<h3>中國與印度（上）</h3>
<p>— 尼赫魯著</p>
<p>本報駐印記者周祥光譯</p>
<p>中國與印度因佛教的傳播，益形接折而發生若干密切關係。此種中印兩國關係的開端，是否發生於阿育王朝代之高，則不得而知；許由中國時常運來絲議等物，才有了海上運輸之業。然在最早時期，必有人民來往及陸上的交通關係，因在印度東部邊界上的人民都像蒙古種族。在尼泊爾方面，更可看出，在阿三及孟加拉兩省，亦是常見的。歷史吿訴吾人：阿育王之傳道事業，普遍發揚光大，如佛教之揚輝於中國，并當開始以後，多少旅行者與學者，往來於中印兩國之間，曾歷千餘年。彼輩皆沿陸路而行，經戈壁沙漠及中亞細亞之山地與平原，越過喜馬拉雅山，——此乃一又久又困難的冒險旅行。不知若干中印旅行人士歷險於此途上，據個中人說：的有百分之九十在途中遭着危險。好多人走到目的地之後，都不再想回來，即在該地居住。但亦有另一路綫，不過不大安全，途程倒比較短一些。此即由海路而行，由越南，爪哇，蘇門答臘，馬來亞及尼科巴鳥嶼。這是常常使用的海上航錢，但有時有些旅行者往往從陸上來，而由海路回去。佛教與印度文化傳佈於整個中央亞細亞及印度尼西亞的一部，在這些地方，有廣多的儈舍及學術研究之所存在着。因此若干旅行者從印度或中國經海陸前往，到達其目的地時，均有安身棲息之所。有時從中國來印的學者，在未到印度之前，先在印尼的印度殖民地中，學習梵文若干時。</p>
<p>關於印度學者到中國的最初紀載，爲迦葉摩騰，於漢明帝時到中國，或許係由明帝之所請。迦葉摩騰卓錫於洛陽，共時天竺學者竺法蘭與彼同來，嗣後到中國的印度著各學者，有鳩摩羅什，達摩等人。他們每一個人中，各收有若干儈人及徒弟。據云：在公天第六世紀時，的有三千印度佛教儈人，及一萬以上的印人，居於洛陽一地。</p>
<p>這些印度學者到中國，不但携有甚多的梵文經典譯爲中文，而且以中文撰述經典。彼輩之所爲，極有助於中國文學，包括詩詞在內。鳩摩羅什於公元四〇一年到中國，渠爲一寫作家，曾著有四十七種經典，留給我們，渠曾將印度哲學大家龍樹著作譯爲中文。嗣耆那笈多去華，的在公元第六世紀中葉，渠曾將三十七種梵文原始經典譯成中文。渠之偉大學問如此被人尊仰，竟使中國唐朝的皇帝，成爲了他的弟子。</p>
<p>中印之間有海陸兩路可通，若干中國學者，均到印度。其中最著名的，且有遊記留存於今日，例如法顯，玄奘，及義凈。法顯和尚來到印度是在公元第五世紀間，他是鳩摩羅什的弟子。當法顯離開他的老師到印度之剎那，其師有一段最感趣味的事吿他。鳩摩羅什曾吿訴法顯到印度後，不但將整個時間用在宗教知識上，同時還要研究印度人民的生活與習慣，所以中國能明瞭印度之全般情形。法顯和尚到印後，才就學於華氏城大學。</p>
<p>在中國學者到印度學法的，最著名的要算玄奘和尚·他在公元第七世紀來到中國，正值中國唐朝全盛時期及戒日王統治北印度的當年。玄奘從陸路而行，經戈壁沙漠，吐魯番，屈支，度葱嶺，跨喜馬而到印度。玄奘曾經吿訴吾人他在途中的歷險事跡，及在中央亞西亞看到有的好多佛教統治者及儈舍，以及突厥人之禮拜佛教僧徒。玄奘遍歷印度各地，且每到一地，即受當地人民之禮拜與尊敬；他并細密考查當地人民與地方情形，舉凡他所聞到的，都經紀載下來。他在那蘭陀大學住了好多年。（譯者註—據黃懺華所著中國佛教史載，先後凡五年）那蘭陀離普德大學亦不遠，他在那蘭陀大學，能給他好多種學術的研究，并與若干從遠飛來的學生，相處一起。據說當時在那蘭陀大學的學儈，的一萬人左右經常居住。玄奘在此大學中，會得有律師學位，復來更成該大學的副校長。</p>
<p>玄奘所著的書爲西域記，是使人百讀不厭的一本書。他來目有高度文化的國家，其時正當中國長安是藝術與文事之中心地，所以他論列到描述印度情形的文章。非常具有價值。他曾吿訴吾人，關於那蘭陀大學成立後之教育制度，及進步情形，并列五門課程，以授生徒：（一）文典、（二）工巧明，（三）醫藥明，（四）因明（今日　輯），（五）內明；他更被一般好學印人所欽慕。若干初等教育至爲發達，儈徒與師父皆成爲教師。關於人民方面，他會說：「普通一般人民性格雖屬浮躁，然却正直與忠誠。對於金錢事物方面，極其誠實。他們并考慮到所行之公正；他們的行爲并不詐欺不誠，而他們所講的話或所答應者，均屬信實。他們政府所定法律非常公正，而他們的行爲亦極溫良善讓。關於犯罪及偷盜等事，非常之少；不過有時偶然有之。」他更說過：「政府之行政設施，建於仁茲原則上面，所行之事亦極簡單，人民并不屬於權力之下。所以，在這一方面，政府所加於人民之賦稅非常的輕。商人來往忙於商業事務之經·」</p>
<p>玄奘國循原路經中央亞細亞回國，此行并攜有大量經典。從他所紀載之書籍中，記有佛教在科拉蕯，伊拉克及摩蘇爾均有極大勢力，更至敘黎亞之邊境。當此時也，佛教在那些地方及伊斯蘭方面逐漸衰微；但同時却已傳入阿拉伯，不久即傳遍斯土各地矣。關於伊朗人民方面，玄奘曾有趣味的觀察着：「他們不注意於學間之道，却能完全致力從事於藝術工作。他們常取利於鄰近各邦。」</p>
<p>伊朗的昔日與今後，無不專心致力於人生的美化與舒展，且此種情形影響遠及於亞洲各地。吐魯番是一個很少的陌生王國，在戈璧沙漠之邊境，玄奘曾經吿訴吾們，并且近數年來因考古家之用力，獲得知識不少。這裏的文化，都是從中國，印度，波斯及希臘文藝之靈感所佈而成的一種混合文化。其語言是印歐語言之一種，取自印度，伊朗及有些類似的歐洲塞爾語；宗教亦從印度傳去，其生活方式則屬於中國的；若干藝術作品則自伊期傳去·佛陀及男女諸神之壁畫與塑像，製作至爲美麗，其神像上常有印度之披衣，和希臘之頭飾。據古洛賽說：「這些女神是代表着印度教的柔和，希臘人的情操，與中國女子的嬌媚的一糧快樂結晶。」　玄奘回到他的母國之後，曾受唐王及人民之歡迎，并決定從事著書及譯述他從印度所携回來的經典。當若干年前，玄奘由中國開始旅行之時，有一故事留傳着，即唐皇曾手執一把泥粉盛於杯中，賜給玄奘日：「你須好自飲之，因爲我已經吿訴你過，故國之一把泥土價值，貢於外邦之一萬兩黃金也。」</p>
<p>玄奘之來印度，極被中印兩國人民所尊敬，進而建立巾印兩國統治者之政治關係。當時北印度曲女城國王戒日與中國唐皇互遣使節。玄奘自己仍留於印度，與其友人互換函札或收藏經典。曾有兩個極有趣之函件，原係梵文所爲，留存於中國。期中一函爲印度佛學家　天於公元六百五十四年間致玄奘法師者，當他間候友朋消息及其文學工作後，進而說這：「我們現在送給你一副白布，聊表我們并未忘記了你·歸路遙遙，望你不必介意此區區送你之物，我們希望你能收受之。關於蘇屈拉及沙司屈拉二部經集，諒你亦所需要，請你給我們以目錄，我們願照抄一部送給你用。」玄奘曾在復信中說：「我最近聽到從印度回來之使節說，偉大的先師戒賢，已經去世，此一消息傳來，使我悲喪無旣至於在經書二經集中之圖書，我均已携回，並且將瑜伽師地福及其他三十卷經早已譯成中文不過我現在要吿訴你的，就是常我經過叩毒河時，我遺失了大宗的神聖經典。我隨函附上這些經典目錄，我要求你們，若有機會，請賜一份。我奉上若千篇短文，當作禮物，希即惠納·」</p>

<h3>富文招待新聞界報告　軍械軍品肇禍始末　損失砲彈兩萬八千餘顆　起火確切原因至今未明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月七日下午肇事爆炸之聯勤總司令部第一補給區江灣第二軍械傭備庫第一分庫，連日經消防人員努力滬水减低熱度，爆炸聲昨日白晝起業已完全停息。第一補給區司令富文將於今晨九時率同部屬前往出事地點繼續挖掘清理，並邀約各報社記者同往參觀。</p>
<p>昨日下午四時，富司令爲使各界明瞭此次肇禍詳情及處理經過，特假司令部持待本市新聞界作一詳盡之報告。茲誌其全部談話如下：（一）倉庫槪况：名稱係後勤司令部第一補給區第二軍械傭備庫第一分庫。地點在江灣體育塲（現稱運動塲）之橢圓形出徑塲。（二）起火時間：本月七日午後一時十五分。（三）起火地點：田徑塲西司令台旁第七號庫房。</p>
<p>起火後之措置</p>
<p>（四）起火後措置：一時二十分接獲庫長傳濟民報告後，即作如下措置：一，以電話致警備司令部譚參謀長，派消防隊搶救。二，派兵一連至起火地點警戒。三，囑軍械處長毛盛樺火速作緊急措置。四，通知所屬其他各倉庫及人運大隊實施戒嚴。五，以電話通知吳市宣司令。六二時起即赴出事地點公同該處警察分局設法搶救。七，在出事地點巡視一小時後，返部以電話報告聯動總司令部黃總司令。八，電囑軍械處長將第一分庫長王仁瓓扣押，但紛亂中王已不知去向，主管庫員吳汝鏢亦已逃　。經將王妻葉素華，吳妻趙盛堂扣押。其中王妻甫於本月六日抵滬。庫長傳濟民則仍在塲搶救。九，是日下午至午夜止，共往出事點巡視四次，因爆炸猛烈，消防隊無法逼的灌救。當時並電警備司令部擬請美空軍派機投擲滅火彈，但因適係星期六下午，美軍休假，致未能實現。（五）燃燒範圍：自西司令台南端起火至東司令台大門止，恰恰爲全庫二分之一。</p>
<p>原因仍未確知</p>
<p>（六）起火原因：經於八日下午會同有關各方，召集庫長，庫兵，運輸兵及浙江供應局第一分站官兵四人（按該分站送來手榴彈一萬餘枚，派官長一人，士兵四人押運，其中士兵一人業已罹難。）曁在逃之分庫長，管庫員之妻及鄉民等審訊。據在塲最後出庫之受傷運輸兵羅德標，陳純基及浙江供應局押運兵袁銘財供稱，彼等於彈藥全部交清後退出時，庫內尙有接收庫丁饒興旺，押運上士排長朱維章等在內整天理。彼等甫登離庫門數步之卡車時，即聞「蓬蓬」連續之爆聲。以此推測，想係交接不愼，手溜彈隆地爆炸。惟究竟原因如何，尙待會同警備部·衛戍司令部·後勤總部繼續調查。</p>
<p>損失數字調查</p>
<p>（七）損失數字：均係自敵僞接收之彈藥，其中堪用部份計手溜彈一〇七三〇顆，七五糧山野砲彈六三一〇顆，日本十年式照明彈十九顆，洩光彈八三顆，　號彈一〇九顆，日本八九式重擲溜彈九〇四三顆，一公斤重烟幕罐八三個，九四式發烟筒九六個，日本十年式雷管一〇三顆，日本一年式點火管四三個，緩燃導火索七八公尺，滅火彈六四五個。廢品部份計八二糎迫緊砲彈八七二一顆，七五糎山野砲彈一一四九〇顆，法國式七七連緊空包彈三八九六顆，雜式步機彈四五噸（每噸約二八〇〇〇顆），雜式砲彈一〇九九顆，三十秒信管空盒子十八個，小型防電器補品箱十一個，一五〇糎溜彈頭三三顆，日本九二式七七彈板五八〇個，安全塞覆蓋一五〇〇個。另三噸重六輪卡車一輛（號碼爲〇二七五七）。</p>
<p>總計堪用及廢品迫擊砲彈及山野砲彈共二八五一五顆。</p>
<p>今晨再往勘查</p>
<p>調查經過：八日午後四時起，會同軍警機關及部屬傳集該分庫官兵及受傷之押運兵等分別個別審訊，至深晚十一時始畢。均供稱係由庫中爆炸，瞬息手榴彈連續爆發而致起火。九日至出事地點勘察，在西司令台旁發現卡車殘骸，車旁及庫內焦爛屍體各兩具。現定十一日上午再往澈查。此外並於八日上午派員赴陸軍醫院調查，有一四六旅砲兵三人運輪兵四人受傷。倉庫附近民房則除玻窗碎裂外，並無損失。</p>
<p>趕辦善後工作</p>
<p>（九）善後辦法：一，派庫長傅濟民督促率官兵清掃被炸處殘彈破片，整理附近他庫。二，請消防隊撲滅餘火。三，將在逃分庫長及管庫員之妻拘押，並追究介紹人，保證人。查此兩人均有股實來歷，故相信係畏罪潛逃，不致有其他作用。四，庫長傳濟民交保，由軍械處副處長鄧光澤具保。五，派定代理分庫長毛啓芳。六，漏夜趕造損失清册並繪圖，呈報國防部陳參謀總長及聯勤總司令部黃總司令備案。七，派兵修理各處門窗。八，續派官兵調查附近民房損失情形。九，繼續偵查肇事之原因。</p>
<h3>主管人員　呈候處分</h3>
<p>（十）責任：自主管庫員，分庫長，總庫長，以迄主管科長，處長，及本人，均應受連帶處分，當呈候上峯懲戒。</p>
<p>最後富司令並述其感想稱，本市無軍械儲設備，該田徑塲原爲日人儲藏庫，勝利後接收各地軍火甚多，庫房不够，雖經呈請建設二萬餘噸庫房，但因經費太大，未能實現，衹得就原有倉庫盡量收容，一切不如理想，且人才交通工具等均不够，致　此禍。警擾全滬人士，極爲抱歉。事後幸蒙各界協助，得於短期內平息，尤爲感激云云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕高等法院檢察處昨日偵訊第三批附逆嫌疑影劇人員十三人，但衹報到陳燕燕，李麗華，周詩穆三人，當由瞿鎔檢察官開庭訊問一過，分別諭令交保候傳。</p>

<h3>穴院長召集各機關團體商討發展生產事業　深盼言管機關工商領袖相助相成期於最短期內解決困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕宋院長爲協助生產事業發展，促進經濟復興，於昨日上午十一時，在中行大樓，邀集市商會，銀錢業公會理事長及常務理事，國家行局主管，財經兩部負責人，開會商討。計到貝淞蓀·吳國楨·徐柏國·霍亞民·李　蓀·徐寄廣·秦潤卿·駱清華·林鳳苞·李叔明·徐子香·李道南·歡陽崙·李雲良·壽景偉·徐維明·劉攻蕓等二十餘人，開會歷二時之久。</p>
<p>設生產貸款審核會按照需要積極貸助</p>
<p>首由宋院長致詞，略謂：政府對於生產事業向極關切。八月間關整外匯，最近修正進出口貿易暫行辦法，其主要目的，均在求生產事業之復蘇，加速國家之建設。惟我國經八年長期抗戰，飽受敵偽之破壤蹂躪，社會經濟秩序，一時不易恢復正常狀態，加之一般心理，於勝利之後，期望過奢，逐易失望。共黨軍隊復到處破壞生產及交通工具，致使國民經濟，陷於紊亂不安之境地。故政府雖就行政設施上給予生產界以種種協助，而各業仍感營運爲難，支持不易。政府於此迭經研討補救方法，期作統盤之調度，謀事業之復興。茲可先爲諸君吿者，有下列數端：一日對於正常生產事業資金之貸助，業已核定辦法，督促國家金融機關暨商業行莊等，按照各業實際需要，積極貨助。特由四聯總處設置生產事業貸款臨時審核委員會，負靑辦理之。其委員經聘請國家行局有關機關，商會·及銀錢兩業負責人員擔任之。以期集思廣益，公平處理。二曰此項生產事業貸款利率，當減低至合理之限度，由中央銀行以轉祗押方式調劑之。三日手續及抵押保證方式等，必力求簡便，以適應各業之需要。四曰正當生產事業所需之機件原料等·當儘量由善後救濟總署，物交供應局，以及其他物資主管機關優先供給。五曰對於有開協助生產專業發展之運輸，設備，運輸費用，勞資糾紛之調處，稅制稅率之修訂等問題，亦正分別研究改善辦法。總期能於最短期內，解除生產事業感受之困難，進謀積極之發展，此則有賴於各級主等機關，社會有關團體，工產領袖，一致協力相助相成，而後可以計日成功，非金融界所能獨力勝任者也。</p>
<p>羣策羣力發揮實效</p>
<p>抑允有不能已於言者，一國經濟之榮桔，生產事業之進步，其關鍵不單在國家政策之是否健全，要知各級主管機關，力其主管業務機關，是否能仰體政府方針，推行不懈，實爲一重要關鍵。至其是否能充份發揮，收獲實效，又不僅主管機關能否努力推行之問題。所有社會有關團體，生產事業本身，甚至社會每一份子，能否配合政府政策，體念環境艱難，羣策羣力，各就崗位，先以國家社會之利益爲重，而不孜孜於一己之得失，則尤重要者也。</p>
<p>努力推動期望三點</p>
<p>本人對於今後生產事業之維護與發展，當努力督率推動，惟下列三項，甚望諸君特別注意：</p>
<p>（一）國家行局及商業行莊對於正當生產事業資金之貸助，固應力求迅速簡便，積極協助，但對於不急要或不正當之放款，則應自動切實限制。</p>
<p>（二）生產事業本身應積極改善管理，改良技術，提高效能，減輕成本，以謀自力之生存與發展，不宜單賴貸款及物資之協助。</p>
<p>（三）經濟及行政主管機關，應切實督促所轄事業，改進業務，共謀策進。其有營運不當，違背國策者，應即嚴格科正之。　經濟事業之改進，經緯萬端。戰後建設，允屬困難。民主黨在美，邱吉爾在英，未嘗因其豐功偉績，倖免人民之責難。蘇俄目停戰以後，物價亦已上漲不少。我國經濟向來落後，受戰事之影響又最久，故復員工作，亦最艱難。所望各界領袖，隨時提供意見。苟有裨於國計民生，總常隨時採擇施行也。</p>
<p>各界發表意見</p>
<p>繼由徐寄　，李馥蓀，秦潤卿，駱淸華，金潤庠等，先後發言，茲綜合各員意見如下：　一，目前工商各界最感因難之問題，爲工資之高漲。緣工資係照生活指數發給，底薪又復提高數倍，致過份加重生產成本，實予產業恩致命之打擊。擬請政府對於工潮工資之調處，早謀合理之解決。</p>
<p>二，目前黑市貸款利率高昂，而商業行莊除繳存中央銀行普存準備金之外，復須保持交換行保證準備政相當據存，致銀錢業正常可以投放資金有限，頗望財部及中央銀行准許通融運用，並靈活國內調配，當可逐漸抑低高利貸。</p>
<p>三，對於生產事業貸款之押品範圍，希望放寬機器作押，不加年齡限制。</p>
<p>四，輪入管理辦法，法良意美，各界一致擁護。惟對在運及到埠各種進口貨物，請早予提銷之便利，俾節費用。至各種出口貨物，如何自政府收購貼補或分別予以差別之獎助優遇，亦請政府早謀妥善方策。</p>
<p>以上各項·當經宋院長分別指示，略謂：除已核定之辦法外，當將谷人意見交由主管分別研究實施云。</p>

<h3>敵偽房地產繼續標售原住戶函參議會呼籲</h3>
<p>中央信託局受蘇浙皖區敵偽產業處理局委託，第二次標賣敵偽房地產，已有一部份於上月二十六日正式標售，依照投標須知第十一項所載：「業已標售之敵偽房屋，一律於簽訂預約後二十日出淸」，各原住戶聞訊大譁，現正多方奔走，冀行政院收回成命。又本市使用敵偽房屋全體居民，茲復函向市參議會呼籲，原函云：「前閱報載，中央信託局公吿標賣三十九單位敵偽房屋，並聲稱該房屋一經標賣，原住戶即須於一個月內遷讓等情。查三十九單位敵偽房屋中，其住戶一部份原爲勝利前老房客，在敵寇壓迫下，尚日維持租貨權，豈有河山光復後，反遭迫遷之理。一部份爲後方來滬公務員，彼等在抗戰期間，追請政府歷盡艱辛，今隨政府復員來滬，在這房荒嚴重之下，窮公務員焉有金條租頂房屋，好容易向中信局取得使用敵偽房屋一幢，如今政府要標賣，硬要迫遷，請問公務員有何餘錢來租項金條約房屋，勢必露宿街頭，政府於心何忍，於情於理，均似未合，故自上决中央信託局公吿標賣後，各敵偽里弄房屋全體住戶，即一致反對，要求保持原租貨權，而興論界亦羣起議論，均謂政府標賣敵偽房屋，充裕國庫，原則上固極贊成，惟標賣後，原住戶即須一律遷出，主管當局似乎太不考慮現實了。因之前往登記投標者，寥寥無幾，而中信局亦因各界興論均不贊成，在此種情形之下，保留一時。惟今閱報載，中信局又要標賣閔行路一八一號等十二單位敵偽房屋，（定於本月十二日開標）。此决標賣，是否係乘各界態度冷靜下來後，再來一次試探，抑或已撤銷原議，維持現住戶之租賃權，我們在未明瞭前，姑且不論，不過我們深恐中信局不顧輿論，固執成見，用敢向市參議會諸公呼籲，請建議政府，在推行一臘政策以前，多斟酌事實，糾正中信局不合理措置。標賣儘管標買，原住戶的租貨權，一定要保持，人民生活最低限度的衣食住行之居住，不客剝奪，否則全市敵偽房屋里弄住戶居民（約一萬餘人），爲免遭流離失所痛苦，定必一致聯合起來，向政府市參議會等民意機關請願。尚望賢明諸公，注意及此。」云云。</p>

<h3>進口棉花結匯希望迅予解決　駁船多待一日所費不貲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出悶業正積極調查戰前每年用棉之數量，職後用棉之數量，及目前實際之需要量，將製成詳細統計數字，送交臨時輸人管理委員會，作爲棉花進口量決定時之參考。又本市進出口公會通日舉行分組會議，因目前原棉爲主要進口品，故九日先由棉花組開會，討論生題爲十一月十七日在外國訂購棉花之請歷問題，及業已抵達之棉花進口許可問題。尤其後一問題之解決，迫不及待，因每一駁船等待一日，所費即在一百萬元左右，實非進悶商所能負報。有關人土希望政府對此事能從寬處理，因進口許口制之宣布，完全突如其來，商界事先毫無準備，故在國外之訂貨不能適應政府之意旨，同時宋院長已表示願放實購棉之外匯頭寸。關於各種商品進悶之限額，政府目前尚在研究階段，決定有待；一俟決定後，其分配在原則上由公會自行辦理。據聞英美進出口商人，已與進出口公會加強聯　。又據進出口業巾人告記者：今日外棉進口數量，以美棉居首位，印度棉居第二位，其，爲埃及及巴西。印度棉已在印政府統制之下，出口時須先請得許可護。</p>

<p>外幣昨又轉鬆，美鈔暗盤自五〇五〇元起，退至五〇〇〇元以內，午刻在五〇〇〇元關內外徘徊，午後平穩少變，五〇〇〇元有求，結果較前收無甚榮辱，港票因金市電匯關係而稍疲，結果較前收回小十元，港匯昨回小至九九〇元右，印匯一一八〇元至一二〇〇元，英匯一五八〇〇元至一六〇〇〇元，成交仍祇港匯稍有做開，餘均沉寂。</p>

<h3>印棉限制出口棉業協會認爲不妥</h3>
<p>〔路透社孟質九日電〕東印棉業協會頃上書印度政府，促請中央政府及早考慮並宣佈棉花政策。文中指出印政府之原棉統制政策已破壞政府條例，並造成黑市。關於棉花出口政策，該會對於本季規定之準許出口數量大　表示同意，但對於課微棉花出口稅原則表示反對。該會稱：棉花向爲印度之過剩商品，印度向來獨一佔短毛頭棉花生產，故此類棉花之出口必須加以維持，務使國家及棉農之　濟利益不致受到影響。該會深恐限制毛頭十六分之十一吋及以上之棉花出口，將屬危險之舉，蓋印度各紗廠未嘗消費毛頭十六分之十三吋之全部棉產，且此類棉花若千數量可准予出口，不致妨礙印度之紗廠。否則此類棉花滯留市塲，則一般棉價勢必抑低云。</p>

<h3>贛省什影</h3>
<p>— 三日航訊　本報南昌記者劉藻</p>
<p>牯嶺劃界　星子九江互爭</p>
<p>牯嶺的劃界，已經引起星子參議會的主要議題，雖然九江的人士，有的注意自願將牯嶺搬開去，但是，爲了縣界的爭執，不見到眞的就甘願的「搬開」。看星子提出的理由，論明牯嶺，並不屬於九江，那末，當然現在的九江在爭執，牯嶺是屬於九江的。</p>
<p>星子縣認爲同治十年所修星子縣志內附星子彊械詳圖，桔嶺在星子轄境內，而九江縣志並無牯嶺屬於九江的記載。九星兩縣的分水嶺，爲自吳章山經小天池，大孤山，土壩嶺，織船峯，上審峯，以至馬頭嶺等峯，牯嶺在此分水嶺之南，自應歸星子管，轄星子更提出最近的辦理牯嶺戶籍的理由，他們說：民國廿五年星子縣府會派員至牯嶺辦理戶政，德化舉人盜賣牯嶺與外國人，經星子士紳極力反對，始獲改爲租賃，他們現在根據這些理山，決定據理力爭。</p>
<h3>督察專員公署　等於公文承轉機關</h3>
<p>關於行政督察專員公署業務機關化的論調，各方均認爲有改進的必要。贛省五年建設計劃，亦許擬建議中央將專署撤銷，並改爲督導機構，機構定名爲督導處，設正副處長或主任二人，將省府各單位所有視導人員分別集中於各區督導，不辦一般行政業務，蓋現有之督察專員公署，雖名爲督察，實際只等於公文承轉機關。</p>

<p>在我國鐵通系統圖上，平漢路和粵漢路接起來若說做「步兵操典」裏「向右看齊」的姿慈，那末，隴海鐵路就像「兩臂平舉的「一字着」，這條向續走的大幹綫，與直行的兩條恰恰構成一個大十字。</p>
<p>近數年以來，隴海鐵路運輸狀態爲各方不滿，巳是一件母須遮掩的事實。在河南方面的「聲譽」如何，記者不很詳細；但在陝酉，則每次省參議會和市臨參會之指摘隴海路，已經成爲一個循例的節目，尤其是運輸量不足民需，早已成爲間題的中心。</p>
<p>當然，鐵路當局也有困難，歸納起歷决聲辯理由，不外乎交通器材的缺乏和逾齡，軍隊和軍給橋運輸的繁忙，局部路綾的治安不安……等。但我們也想一問：站上黑市票之橫行，車上查票員之明目張膽揩油，站上車上之一無秩序，甚至擠滿各人在黑夜裏摸索行駛的露頂貨車連一個亮也不會每輛都有，……諸如此類的事情，在理諭上或事實上是否有關乎「聯總」之不發給新機車？</p>
<p>記者曾聽到一位對此間物價做了好幾年紀錄工作的人說，西安數年間物價之漲，差不多每决都發現有人卸責於隴海路軍皮不足的一類報導。記者留陝兩年，亦有相同的感覺。遠的不必說，近之如月來糧食暴騰一倍多，煤也漲，　也漲，無一事沒有人指摘路局運輸量的缺乏。然而運輪量果眞是如此騰不出來嗎？我們頗想保留肯定或否定的回答。記得大的兩個月以前，西安的燃料貴，因而從甘肅東運經實鵝以達此　的煤油也跟着貴。人們尚官營的國產煤油運營機關要買，他們股，沒有存貨，因爲「好幾個月來我們公家的煤油大批都停在實鵝，搜不到軍皮運呢！」然而固時市面「商人」托路局數運東來的煤油却源源而至，並無匱乏之眞。像這種事情，其中原因，一呼即出？</p>
<p>十二月二日隴海路局長人事更迭了，接任的是由南京調來的莫衡氏。交通界人士似乎在寄以期待。這位新任局長由徐州沿綫視察一番來西安，他第一句「診斷」，說隴海鐵路是「先天不足，後天失調」，基於這「診斷」的後日「處方」如何，我們不妨讓「時間」來考騐。然而就在新接任前的幾天，鐵路班决誤點得相當利書，有人說是「齊黃不接」時必有的現象，但局外人看來，似乎是對於素與郵政稅關並稱的鐵道「人事制度」投一　刺！</p>
<p>據莫氏發表的談話稱：「中牟段便在本年底以前即可搶修元工，如此，則鄭州以西即可增關班車。鄭州以西的一段貨客運，預計三個月內將可改善，半年後進入正軌，一年後即可恢復正常。」以該段路綾之棉長，目下工事的草率，假如在一年果能正常化，這當然是鐵道復員中的一件大事。</p>
<p>「不過，」莫氏部提出如下之「但書」了：「器材供應尚有待解決，因爲其來源不外乎一，由「聯總」供給；二，由政府用信用借款方式購置，但前者「聯總」以隴海路按近戰區，不願接濟，而後者洽購與輸運，亦非馬上可行。且目下時屆深冬，一切工事，須待明春始能着手，目下僅能儲備器材而已。……」記者照錄如右，以備三個月，六個月而至一年後與事實印證。</p>
<p>從實谿再往西一看，戰時倉卒動手，戰後草率竣工「報賬」的實天（水）鐵路，至今仍然不通，統計今年通軍以來，因塌下土方面不通車的日子顯然此可勉強通車的日子來得多了。（自從今秋大塌變决以後，雖積極修理，本想冬初竣工，以便利農歷歲晚客商來往，但看情形這可能性已極微少了。這月底修不好，遲些則因冰雪關係，無前如何也不能着手。股等待明春雪溶冰解以後麼，那更糟，因爲雨水增多，不合規定的土坡與路基，其塌倒處祗可能有增無減！</p>
<p>再往西一看「天（水）蘭（州）」段初步工事，道幾個月以來總算靠「以工代賑」的方法做了一些土方工程，但最近亦因氣候關係，漫天冰雪，以致無法着手，祗好導到明年春暖花開，才能復工。據說明年還是繼續用「以工代賑」來徵集民工，預計最順利也得化三年才能竣事。</p>
<p>倒過頭來看東便徐州到海州道一段，據說亦已着手復軌，詳細情形不在筆者報導範國以內，茲從略。</p>
<h3>日本土地改革</h3>
<p>— 張德乾譯自基督教科學箴言報</p>
<p>日政府所擬打破封建農田制度之計劃，經盟軍最高統師部之核准，初决予以公佈。多數非日籍專家咸認爲此項計劃絕鮮民主改革之精神，殊不足據以爲打破日本最不民主經濟制度之一種手段也。</p>
<p>據和田農相向記者解釋，此項土地改革新法案，爲一種土地經濟革命，其宗旨在根除原有之專制制度，蓋日本農民向受無情剝削，被迫廉價出賣其勞力，而爲都市實業家所利用。故擬分割大地產，由政府輔助，轉售予數百年來受盡專橫地主之奴役之小佃戶。</p>
<p>關於此項新法案，麥帥會　表意見，「對於現政府根除古地主制度方面所顯示之勇氣與決心，認爲滿意」。麥帥復信，該法案「將爲日本土壤消除共害蟲」。</p>
<p>實則此項新法案僅爲土地之再分配。至少在紙面上爲如此），然據此間有資格土地問題專家指陳，則該法案漏洞殊多，日本官吏儘可隨意湮減其改革原旨。</p>
<p>此間某專家形容該法案爲「猶諸築攔護糧，以防野兔，而僅及三面也。」</p>
<p>就其實質而言，此次農林省所擬之土地改革法案，其目的在使佃戶有機會獲得全國耕地的五分之四。舉例言之，倘該法案能全部實現，則現由佃戶耕種之六百五十英畝土地中，將有五百英畝以上，歸佃戶所有。屆時日本全部可耕地中，將祇有約十分之一爲佃地。</p>
<p>日政府將按每段（日制：每段的合五分之一英畝）的日金七百五十七元之代價”向地主收買土地，復以長期貸款方式轉售給未來之所有人。前佃戶將以全年收成約三分之一繳納政府，爲期三十年，大教與其平時所應繳之地租相等。</p>
<p>該法案之主要漏洞，似爲對於每一家庭所許有之土地限額，未予規定，亦未規定佃戶或「他人」所許購之土地限額。</p>
<p>數星期前，麥帥以土地改革問題提交聯合國管制日本委員會時，該委員會一致建議，任何人之土地所有，應以七英畝半爲限，逾此即應再分配，售拾其他小地主，以免富農乘機多購土地，僱工代耕。</p>
<p>和田農相昨率直語記者，此項計劃「不論現在或將來，均將不能實行。」渠懷然宣示，祇須農民允承自耕，新法案並不禁止其購買大片土地。</p>
<p>新法案復規定，自耕農持有七英畝半以上之土地者，祇須耕種合格，便毋需將其溢額出售。此節對於大片耕種不善之土地殊有袒護之嫌，蓋此種士地實不如分配給需田孔殷之示小農之爲愈也。</p>
<p>尚有一漏洞，即依照法案規定，土地改革計劃之施行，大部份須出於地方委員會之手，該委員會以佃戶與地主各半數組織之。</p>
<p>現時之日本頒袖，倘質欲實行民主改革，則此事當可實現“但目前之行政機關頗有以全力保持舊制度之傾向，則該委員會之成續勢必難如所期。良以日本佃戶懾伏於地全淫威之下，由來已久，一旦令其與地主共同議事，勢必惟地主之馬首足瞻。即遇不能解決之事，需移付縣知事予以處理時，又以縣知事多數係以地主爲背景者，仍必與佃戶有所不利。</p>
<p>據日政府估計俟改革計劃全部實現之時，則現有之三千七百萬佃農中，將祇剩七百人仍爲佃農。惟據和田農相昨語記者，則政府尚未爲該計劃另設預算機關，以目前尚無預算可做也　和田農相復宣稱，日政府將運照盟軍最高統帥部之規定，於二年內完成該計劃，因麥帥曾於法案文末批定，該法案限於二年內完成之。</p>
<p>據和田農相指陳，該法案原文內並無時間上之限制，其實施端賴地方委員會之能否遵守法案原旨。故該法案最大之弱點，即在雖有一種民主土地改革之方法，而並不含強制性，其能否實現須親日本官吏之是否忠實而定，與其他僅爲一紙其文之民主改革法案並無二致。而實際上據此間多數觀察家之觀感，則現時日本官吏之是否忠實，尚頗成問題也。</p>

<h3>蒙面匪徒刦火輪　一語觸怒·槍殺軍人</h3>
<p>歲月進入到冬令，贛省治安，日形嚴重，不但單身行路，心上感到不寗，汽車拋錨亦被擊。有一輛兩棲吉普車，渡過了張公渡，亦遭匪徒光顧，接着又是二條火輪，同在距離南昌市郊的十五華里的三家店河面，同遭洗刦，輸上賬房的銀物，旅客的行李，一併被蒙面化裝的匪徒捆載而去，杳無踪影。「新雲生」輪上的一個無名姓的軍人，看到操外省口音的匪徒，橫行搜刦，說一聲：「同志！你們何必如此作法」？這句話觸上了他們的怒氣，一槍斃命，連屍首亦推到河中，再放上一槍。</p>
<p>現在江西的旅行，眞的感到「行路難」，王陵基主席於某日由南昌赴九江轉南京，爲了沿途的安寗，大隊衛士護送，道不是玉氏的大擺威風，多半是事實上所必需。</p>
<h3>新喻縣站長　欠糧自殺？</h3>
<p>江西今年的田糧征實，自十一月開始征收後，現據田糧處息：各縣報省業已征集者，共計十八萬石，以泰和等縣成績較優，照此比額計算，本年年底以前可能征足入成，前傳新喻縣糧食運輸站長自殺，據傳係因欠糧太多，（欠四萬石）企圖藉此匿避，以卸責任。</p>
<h3>臺中去來</h3>
<p>— 十二月一日臺北航訊　本報臺灣特約記者楊育</p>
<p>作爲一個全台政治經濟中心的台北市，在一個從國內來初决接觸到的人說，對精神的怡逸，似乎已可以得到滿足，可是倘你由這裏出發，向綠島的每一個角度作進一步的探尋，那我敢說你的心靈將會被更情新的事物填得滿滿的。二十七日早晨，我帶了簡單的行囊，乘上了滑向實島西部大平原的列軍，作一次短時期的台中小旅。</p>
<p>海邊風光　紺碧幽邃</p>
<p>海岸鐵道是和合灣海峽並肩向西展延着，忽而它們離得遠遠地，忽而又擁抱在一起，白砂，靑松，碧水，就這樣半掩半羞地從車窗裏映進了眼簾。我更愛那些滿堆着晶瑩的鵝卵石的大溪流，緩緩地從離開車身有幾十米高的大橋底下向那迷濛渺浩的海邊流去。一石，一草，一木，在這裏多成了詩意的點綴。時屆十二月了，但是暖洋洋有如駘蕩的春風，還一陣陣向你身上飄拂薰迷。</p>
<p>大科崁溪，大肚溪，大甲溪，大該溪等寬闊的大溪流，流貫了高山峻嶺向西排水，造成了米，蔗產量豐富的西方平原，雖然現在的水流並不湍急，甚至有的還淸楚地呈現了乾涸的河床，但是一遇豪雨，水勢驟急，侖像隊千軍萬馬到處奔騰氾濫。爲了防止這種禍患，許多溪道的兩旁多護有三合土的護岸工程。陳長官最近對造林事業極爲重視，眞的要保護西方肥沃的大平原，開墾荒蕪的野地，是應當從溪流的上遊造成一勞永逸的大保安林，單靠一些護岸工程是不够的。</p>
<p>海岸鐵道從台北直達台南高雄，到台中要在彰化換車。道一段穿進台中盆地的旅程，雖祗短短的半小時，可是紺碧幽邃的海邊風光到這裏已一變而爲菜祿稻黃的農家景色了。</p>
<p>文化都市　無限恬靜</p>
<p>從車站的大門間，我開始會見了實島九大都市第六位的台中市，負有「小京都」之譽的「日本式模範都市」，帶給了人無限的幽靜感。這裏一直保特一着她的悠嫻姿態。　鐵路綫把這裏截成兩部份，東面是工業區，西面是祿川與柳川兩條小河問的一塊繁華市區。事實上道裏却是靜謐得可以，油光光的柏油馬路上，僅有些稀疏的行人足步聲而已。熟帶情調的棕樹，迎風拂來了陣陣淸香。過去大家都稱這裏是一個文化都市，的確，這裏有許多完善的中小學校，有二十幾個公私立圖書館，有……但是現在呢？就拿書店來說，一個在台中住了二十一年的人開設了一家規模很大的力行書店，裏面只有二，三十本不成樣的書，他如中央書店，文化書店等也沒法令人找到一本，可以一看的書籍，除非你向舊書店去搜索，戰爭雖給這文化之都帶來了厄運，不過有接的損害還輕，幾所建築瑰偉的中小學校裏，每天早晨已滲出了國歌的聲浪，「雷雨」在這裏上演着，林鶴年的音樂會也吸引了不少聽眾，文化之都的復　，似乎已經起步了，這樣一個幽美的環境，希望大家把文化的新種子儘量地撒布下去吧！</p>
<p>夜步街頭，往昔最熱鬧的「榮町」「錦町」等已經改爲中山路，中正路，自由路，店鋪雖是燈火輝煌，然而顧客却少得可憐。小坐「紅翼茶室」，在幽凄的燈光映着的盆景下面，聽一段「藍色的多腦河」，道稱情趣使我對這文化之都感到異樣的可愛與神往！</p>
<p>酒香處處　垂涎三尺</p>
<p>台灣全省屬於專賣局的型酒工塲，一共有三十四處，分布於台北，台中，台南，台東，嘉義，花運港等地，其中規模最大的要算是台北的板橋製酒工塲，其决就是台中鐵道東側復興路畔的一處了，我曾抽空去參觀了一次。過去，台中的專賣分局與酒工塲，是合在一起的，至今年八月間，即吿分開，專賣分局尺管專賣物品的配銷，酒工塲則致力於生產製造。</p>
<p>製酒工塲的陳事務股長，首先領導記者到製造「白露酒」的工塲裏去參觀。成立了二十多年的工塲，從房屋的外表看上去，確已顯得非常蒼老，何況戰爭也沒有饒過它，丟了一個炸彈在它旁邊。光復以後，曾接收後加以修理，開工了一個時期。可是現在又因損壞而停工了。「白露酒」普通就呌米酒，原料是米，另外再加糖或蜜發酵而成。製釀發酵的一室裏，有着十四個大鐵桶，當米糖放在裏面經過十餘天的發酵後，就有無數的鐵管把初步釀成的酒通至蒸餾室，加以嚴密的蒸餾，其間因爲混雜有許多渣滓，所以蒸餾後就輸至一隻紫銅色的鍋爐裏去過濾，經過這幾道手續後，米酒即吿製成，然後再從管子裏流至倉庫間裏的大桶中，加以貯藏，隨時隨地多可以把它輸至包裝間裏去裝瓶。製作的方法因爲大部份依靠機械，所以雇用的工人並不多，總計整個酒工塲中，約有二百名左右，米酒的酒精含量是百分之二十二，普通人吃似會感到些刺激。雖然這部份工塲停工很久，可是在裏面轉了幾個圈子，到處多聞到一股觸鼻的酒香，「一杯在手萬事全休」的老　們到了這裏，無疑的會涎垂三尺的。</p>
<p>現在所開工製造的是含酒精百分之十七的「芬芳酒」，手續比較繁墳一點，雖然原料也是米，但必須要揀精白的，先使它浸水後取出製趨，再使他在許多大鐵桶中發酵，之後就把另一間專貯着的酒精用管中通到裏面，這樣只要經過八，九天後，也可算是製成了酒，不過因爲含酒精的純度很低，怕有細菌潛在，且防其變質，所以初步製成後，加以過濾，再使它從鐵管中流過一個熱度很高的沸水爐，殺滅細菌，然後通至貯藏室。可是到了貯藏室的大桶裏，它還得隔兩個月才可以取出裝瓶。</p>
<p>每日產酒　二百公担</p>
<p>裝瓶間裏機聲震耳，可叮噹噹的教　瓶響成一片。在機器的一端斯個女工把空瓶一排排的塞在架子上，一層層的被機器捲進去在冷熱水中淴了幾個浴，但當它們從另一端出來的時候却還是排得端端正正的，然後又機械地向前開步走，中間經過一個專司檢瓶的女工後，就一個個左右週旋在一架裝酒機上，依决地被引上，裝滿放下，再移至另一架裝蓋機上裝好了瓶蓋，道時候許多女工又把它們塞進了一架大機器中，再沐一次蒸氣浴。你將以爲這是最後一次的除菌，消毒了吧？其實不，當實們　淋淋的從裏面出來以後，還要經過一個女工用電證光仔細將它檢查有無破裂及雜質，然後才由人工貼上了標紙，加以包紮，聽說以前運貼紙與包扎也是用機器的。</p>
<p>這樣高速度的生產，每天可有二百公担的成品，的可裝酒一萬二千瓶。不過近來銷路不如理葱那樣好，因爲很多人不能澈底明際專賣事業的性質，以致私酒充斥，成了一個最大的影賽，往昔日本人統治台灣，財政收入百分之七十九是依靠專賣事業，可是現在我們却在爲專賈事業嘆苦經，相差不可以道里計，眞是從何說起呢？</p>
<h3>磚瓦工業在江南</h3>
<p>— 六日訊　本報杭州特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>滬杭鐵路綫，這條江南的大動脈兩旁，確是侈稱得上豐　的了。不過她僅是在農業方面有成就，工業方面却顯得很脆弱，除了長安，嘉興等地的絲廠，硤石等地的織布，織襪廠，杭州等地的絲網廠，嘉興的紙廠，嘉善的磚瓦工業之外，其他簡直無可介紹。抗戰勝利以後，這地脆弱的工業非但沒有復甦過來，而且更顯得凋令殘敗。絲綢外銷無路，內銷也困難，布，襪，紙亦然如此，而且大量的外貨行銷在中國的市塲上，使滬杭錢上這一點點不堪一吹的工業，瀕臨嚴重的關頭。</p>
<p>不過磚瓦業，似應該在此時抬起頭來的，因爲國內普遍的破壞，須急待建設，到處鬧着房荒須急待營建住產，而且外國人決不願意把磚頭搬運到中國來做賣買的，因爲磚瓦笨重，在經濟的原則上是非常的不合算。</p>
<p>七個窰區</p>
<p>嘉善的磚瓦，始創於明代洪武年問，到淸末開闢上海杭州租界，磚瓦需求，劇烈的增加，在民國十年前後，就有公司組織，到二十年，全縣磚瓦公司，成立達十五家。那時，磚瓦的運銷，遍及江浙兩省，爲江南磚瓦工業的中心。嘉善市面，也得以繁榮不少。</p>
<p>全縣可分七個窑區，全盛時動燒窑墩七百座以上，農民以造坏爲副業的佔百分之八十以上。窑區爲玉河，范涇，下甸廟，天壬莊，洪家灘，淸涼庵，千窑等七處，道七處都有小港可通，舟楫朝發午至，後又有以划船裝馬達改造的汽划子行駛其間，交通便利。有窑的主人共計約七百五十戶，販坏的商人的有一百二十五戶，做坏的佔窑區人口數約百分之八十以上。磚瓦坯大都爲本地坯農製造，坏泥來源爲嘉善的路南與嘉興南鄉，江蘇吳江蘆墟等地。這七個窑區，，所產磚瓦的種類與品質各有不同，所以他的銷區也各不同，例玉河產二號磚和定勝，黃道，銷區爲蘇州，嘉興。范涇產三號傳，黃道，墁磚，一銷區爲上海浦東。下甸廟爲一，二，三號磚，銷區爲上海。天壬爲三號磚，大小瓦，墁磚，銷區爲杭州及內地各埠。洪溪爲一二三號磚大小瓦，方磚，銷區爲十之七上海，十之三內地各埠。淸涼庵爲一，二，三號磚，定勝，黃道，十之八銷上海，十之二銷內地各埠。千窑爲三號磚，平瓦，行銷各大都市及本縣四鄉。</p>
<p>窰墩　分佈</p>
<p>至於窑墩的分佈：玉河爲八十三座，范涇爲六十五座，下甸廟爲一百廿四座，天壬爲一百廿一座，洪溪爲二百四十五座，淸涼爲三十三座，千窑爲一百五十六座，總計爲八百二十七座。在戰前，這八百二十七座的窑數，幾沒有一座爲製坯工人或是動燒工人所有的，都是有幾個錢的人，建造起窑墩，利用農民農歇的期間，號召一些人做坏動燒的。這許多窑工，也並不以爲主要的職業，而是作爲一種副業的收入。工作的程序很簡單，是把泥載來後，用一空格子型的坏模放入泥土做成了坏，再把坏載到燒的地方去。窑墩好像一座墳山，上面豎立一個烟囪，燒窑的工人把坏放進去，用稻草和煤屑燒，燒時由挑水工人不斷地挑着水爬到窑墩上面去，向下面燒的磚瓦澆去，窑工要身入窑墩去取出燒成的磚來，在炎夏之時，有些窑工，從窑墩裏出來後會暈厥在地上的，因爲窑墩裏的溫度過高了。磚製成後，就是出裝，用舟船載着滿船的磚瓦，便可人市變賣。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，因爲烽火遍地，許多要建築的人都存觀望之心。同時地價房價的不安定也使有心人裏足不前。農村殘破，許多人速田都耕不了，還有誰希罕還區區薄利來做製坏的工作呢？於是許多窑墩都沒有出烟，磚瓦工業也將瀕於破產。</p>
<p>改善窰業</p>
<p>依據我們以上所述，知道以往的。窑業是在窑商的手裏，育接生產的工人是沒有份的。在道磚瓦工業瀕於破產的時候，我們想到一個更優良的辦法，即是扶助窑工發慶窑業。因爲磚瓦經販坏和窑商的轉嫁，道其間已增加了成本，加厚了剝削，直接生產的窑工和直接建築的工程師都受着沒有理由的盤剝。我們不妨使建築事業的人和磚瓦生產的工人打成一片，免除中間人的漁利。可由預備建築的人貸款與生產的窑工，由窑工生產供應建築的人，豈不很好？但這是比較近於理想了，在這繁複的社會裏，急功好利的多於仗義爲公的人，如果要這樣做，必須政治上軌道，用政治的力量來扶助窑工，始有辦法。再不然，我們要求政府，利用救濟物賣，直接貸款與窑工，使窑工能直接生產。如果窑商不合作，則可由政府另建新式窰墩，向國外採購機器，開始燒窑。這筆龐大的費用，我認爲都可在救濟物內設法的。這才是眞正的救濟勞苦大眾。眞正的復甦嘉善的磚瓦工業。因爲窑商們的中間獲利，使窑工得不着利益，使建築者感着磚瓦價格太高，便影響了建築事業，影響了窑工的工作情緒，影響了磚瓦業的改良和發展。</p>
<p>窰業組織</p>
<p>現在嘉善一些聽明的人們，他們巳在進行窑業組織，開始作窑業貸款的一要求了。我覺得窑業貸款的呼籲是應該的但應該貸在勞工的身上抗戰期間，這許多破壞的地方都待建設，像浙江省這樣，還有大量　築房屋的呼籲，如果磚瓦業經巾開人漁利，成本加重後，對道千千萬萬無屋居住的人實在是一個甚大的威脅，我們豈尚欲待外國磚瓦運到中國來，在中國土地上建築房屋，以濟中國的房荒嗎？（於善滬途中）</p>
<h3>「解放區」雜話</h3>
<p>有一個負担鬥爭責任的幹部，夜間回府，被一個人抱起來給丟在井里，由於井小人橫沒有身沉井底，第二天又被幾個担水夫救出來，事情很明顯的指出，這是他鬥爭的反映，而那邊幹部們偏偏咬定牙根說，這是特務幹的·於是「爲人民服務」的防特運動展開了，那邊的人民便粉紛被捕了，在這押進放出的歲月里，又不知有多少人死亡·殘廢，而每屬被押者的家里，又不知有多少家庭逃亡，離散，甚而被那些幹部給打了游擊，（按打游擊即男女茍合之謂）我親眼看見二個姓馬的醫生，那些幹部以「不了解」三個字，便押了他一年又二個月，我還親眼看見，那些幹部像開玩笑似的，把五個人拉出去槍斃，內中一個靑年，想要說話，那些幹部用　的槍，向肉的頭上狠命的打，常赤血滴染黑鐵的一剎那，這個靑年的頭下垂了，二條腿不支了，這時候那些幹部以拖死狗的姿態，拖到他們從不固定的刑塲，這五個被殺者，事前旣未經過所謂公審，事後也沒有隻字公佈，這種不明不白的死法，委實太懊慘了！（朱曉天）</p>

<h3>南斯拉夫獨裁狄托朝秦暮楚　曾助沙皇軍隊向紅軍作戰</h3>
<p>— 本報譯美國紀事報卡西尼著</p>
<p>「狄托」這個名詞，對於數百萬的寒爾比亞人，哥羅特亞人，斯拉夫人以及鐵幕以外的廣大民眾，是個恐怖的象徽，瘋在崇拜共產主義理想的腳色。</p>
<p>狄托爲使共產主義神聖化及爲政治上的目的，在巴爾幹發動過殘忍的戰役，他雖然因爲這一戰役而在國際上蒙受不好的名譽，但已在史達林的抬舉下，成爲數百萬無辜人民的統治者，爲克林姆宮的「唯命是從」傀儡領袖。</p>
<p>如果他的主子史達林要追索關於狄托身世的話—狄托前名義布羅茲（J．Broz）是前白俄羅斯反共的首要—那麼，狄托的臉當和他手上所高舉的旗子，以及他以前殺人所染紅的「血手」一樣的赤紅。</p>
<p>原是反共</p>
<p>無論狄托—在羅茲—如何的誇耀他忠於共產黨的淸白身世，但是他並不是一出娘胎就講俄語，他是哥羅特的天主教徒—現仍是天主教徒—當他初出身時，是個反共份子。他的父親和母親是哥羅特亞敬畏上帝的農人，假如他們仍在世上面見到狄托殺人的偉大成就時，當會破口大罵，把他溺斃。</p>
<p>三易其名</p>
<p>狄托想把一九一五年至一九二〇年的一段生活，置諸腦後，因爲在這段時期中他曾參加匈奧聯軍在蘇俄前綫抵抗革命軍隊。在一九一五年被俘送至西伯利亞，據他自已說確係被俘，但有人說他是奔投蘇俄的。</p>
<p>在那時候，沙皇正在勸導斯拉夫人向中央政權叛變，並且組織南捷兩國志願軍帮助帝俄軍隊作戰。但是狄托直至最近才向一位美國記者否認他曾經參加南斯拉夫隊伍作戰。</p>
<p>美國駐西伯利亞遠征軍首領古羅夫將軍曾寫一本書，在進本書裏面有一張照片，照片中有幾個法國，美國，英國和日本的軍官，同時也有一個名呌布羅茲（即狄托）少校穿着白俄羅斯軍隊的軍裝，從這本書證實狄托忠於共黨的話是不可能的。</p>
<p>由一九一五年至一九二〇年狄托所做的工作，是不能吿人的，可是在這時期內，歷史專家亞力山大泰山芝，在敘述一七七七年至一九一七年美俄關係，的一本「沙皇與總統」審中却有如下的敘述：</p>
<p>在一九一七年三月革命爆發　·有羅茲（即狄托）尚遠在西伯利亞，當奧國於一九一八年十一月崩潰時，狄托則在南斯拉夫軍隊裏，在哥爾治克將軍的反共家中，當一個軍官及哥爾治克將軍的統治崩潰後，狄托又投向紅軍，這次狄托的轉變，與前决當由奧國而投向沙皇，毫無二致。</p>
<p>在上述照片中（該照尚在我們的手中）狄托留了卓別麟式的鬍子，頭髮暫受傷寒症而脫落了，但他的臉孔仍和現在的一樣。　對於參加酉班牙內戰的事實，狄托會強調的否認，但他那時的好友麥爾拿路克斯說：布羅茲曾任路卡克斯軍（屬於國際軍）的政治委員，道時狄托的名字是「恩多尼奧」。</p>
<p>狄托的全部事業，似乎得力於改變，姓名，信仰和主義。最後由完全淸淨的教士走向南斯拉夫而被驅逐出教。</p>
<p>現在共產主義是有勢力的，但安知明天不會帶來其他新的觀念，使狄托，布羅茲，恩多尼荷再加上一個新名而求教會的保運，予史達林嚴重的打擊呢？</p>
<p>善變的狄托</p>
<p>曾經二次改名換姓，先是一個教士，後來參加反共軍，現在是親共，圖示狄托一九一八年身穿反共軍軍裝，正在打算怎樣消滅共軍</p>

<h3>西南非</h3>
<p>— 佐祺</p>
<p>在聯合國第二次全體大會中，南非聯邦總理史末賣，曾提出合併西南非洲之要求，中國·蘇聯及東歐數國均加反對。</p>
<p>西南非洲（South　West　Africa）南與南非聯邦接壤，北界葡屬西非洲，東與英屬貝專納保獲地覺連，西臨大西洋，而積約八十三萬五千方公組，此地在十九世紀中葉各歐陸強國探險非洲時，由德國劃爲勢力範圍，一八八四年柏林會議中，議定爲德國保護地，至一九一五年歐戰中爲南非聯邦軍隊所佔領，歐戰後即託南非聯邦代管。（西南非沿大西洋海面之鯨灣，及附近一千一百餘方公里地域，則自一八七八年以來，即屬英台國，歸南非管理。）</p>
<p>西南非洲內洲爲乾燥地，可畜收，海岸產榖類，近年境內又發現金剛石礦與銅礦。首邑溫德和克（Windhoek），畜收極盛，鐵路通達海岸。</p>
<h3>美政府積極推行太平洋基地計劃</h3>
<p>— 溪譯自紐約時報</p>
<p>太平洋美國基地問題現已成爲聯合國未來的一大關鍵，世界眼光羣集於此，同時亦爲未來「對日和會」之一主要難題，與我國關係至爲密切。本文爲紐約時報專論，爰特譯出。</p>
<p>美總統杜魯門建議將太平洋中的日太委任統治鳥嶼置於聯台國託管下面以美國爲唯一行政當局，這建議對於聯合國和美國對列強關係牽涉甚廣。</p>
<p>此項建議所涉及的鳥嶼包括三大類，即馬利亞納羣島，加羅林羣島和馬紹爾羣鳥。但是在前日本委任統治地以外，尚有另外一類太平洋島嶼，即如冲繩島和硫磺島等，都是日本的屬地，可能成爲美國的重要軍事前哨。因此美國每决討論到太平洋中戰略基地時，必然涉及這一類島嶼。</p>
<p>美國建議置於有條件託管下的委治區域，最初是德國的麗地，第一次世界大戰後由國際聯盟委託日本管理。可是日本違反委任統治的條約，在那百萬方哩廣裏的區域裏建立起強大的防禦基地。</p>
<p>太平洋的安全</p>
<p>現在美國爲保全它在太平洋中的地位，已經把日本從這些要塞驅逐出去，在沒有得到能够利用這些島嶼作爲軍事基地的保證以前，美國是不肯輕易放棄的。非但如此，美政府內部雖已開始討論到委治問題，海軍部却已經擇定可作基地用的　點，而進行建立基地的計劃了。關島上的建築工事正在積極進行中，在阿普拉海港所築的防波堤將近完工，耗賽數百萬美元，同時已在佈置海陸空軍的配備。</p>
<p>太平洋區總司令杜佛斯海軍上將最折宣佈一個偉大的計劃，擬將關島建設成和珍珠港一樣重要，甚至一樣鉅大的基地。珍珠港在關島以東四千哩，東西兩大基地，遙相對峙，控制着整個太平洋。但是照海軍部的看法，關島不應該像從前一樣作爲美國的一個孤立的外哨，應該是一個廣大的要塞網的核心，而以阿留地擊島，夏威夷羣島，美屬蕯摩亞島及帛琉羣島，極西的加羅林島，以及冲繩島硫礦島作爲它的外聞錢。帛琉羣島中的烏立土島自被美海軍克復以後，即被用作艦隊確泊所。加羅林羣島中的特魯克島原長日本的海軍要塞，後來被美海軍作爲同樣用途。</p>
<p>關於太平洋委治地置於聯合國託管下以後，美國將吾喪失戰略基地的控制權一點，美國軍事領袖和政府當局曾經從長考慮過。結果他們認爲美國不特應歸併日本委任統治地，並應保留琉球羣島中的冲繩島，小笠原羣島中的硫礦島，和其他在安全上認爲必要的島嶼。</p>
<p>戰略區託管制</p>
<p>美國的建議係根據聯合國憲章的條款所規定，該條款准許各國在安全理事會下面非在託管理事會下設定「戰略防區」託管制。聯合國憲章第八十三條規定：「聯合國關於戰略防區之各項職務，包括此項託管協定倏款之核准，及其更改或修正，應由安全理事會行使之。」</p>
<p>該條文於確定此種管轄權以後，又准許託管委員會得在戰略防區內行使極有限之職權，並授權安全理事會咨請託管理事會處理戰略防區內的政治經濟社會及教育事項。但安理會的這一行動應受託管協定條款的的束；這就是說，作爲協定發起人的美國對於此事享有最後發言權。</p>
<p>封鎖基地區域</p>
<p>根據美國的計劃，美國有權拒絕託管委員會于涉託管領土內的「封鎖基地區域」。這可以視作美國的軍事甚地，有時候也可視作整個託管領土。美國務院所逢議的託管協定和其他託管建議，像英法二國關於東非若干領土所提出的建議，不同的地方也就在道方面。「戰略防區協定」之提出於聯合國，當以美國的此項計劃爲嚆矢。</p>
<p>這一計劃保全美國在封鎖區域內的特權，在美國人看來，足以保障美國在太平洋中要害地區的安全，可是在安全理事會中一定有人提出反對。須知在該會中要通過一個提案必須獲得全體一致的決。</p>
<p>第一，或許有人會提出這一個問題：美國所要求的是否僅僅是名義上的託管，還是實際上的兼併？就美國建議的內容而論，美國居於行政當局的地位，握有「行政，立法與司法的全權」，那被管的領土變成了美國的一部份。但美國務院方面的解釋則謂該協定內的硬性的字句，不過是用來說明美國行政權的專門的用語而已。</p>
<p>第二，關於美國健議除特別約定外，禁止外國飛機飛臨託管領土一節，或許也會引起反對。</p>
<p>引起爭議焦點</p>
<p>但是嬝大的反響大約是對於封鎖基地防區的規定。以蘇聯爲例，對於建議的道一部分，縱不致發生驚奇，幾乎可以斷定它是決不贊間的。蘇聯對於美國在個太平洋方面的地位本來已很關切，對於美國得在蘇聯邊境可受轟炸威脅的範圍內難立秘密要塞的計劃，恐怕是難以客忍的。蘇聯將認爲美國對委任統治各島的建議，就是杜魯門總統爲第一一次世界大戰以後應由美國負責管理的任何日本鳥嶼所決定的命運。</p>
<p>這些島嶼的命運究竟如何，須視和會的決議以爲斷定。到目前爲止，美國還沒有提出任何要求。美國海軍部發言人堅特道些鳥嶼是與安全有極大關係的，贊成此項意見的人主張：美國曾犧牲無數生命得來的冲繩島和硫磺島，應該「歸併」於美國。</p>
<p>隊聯很明瞭美國在這些日本島嶼的數大利益，將來討論到美國的託管協定時當然不會忘懷於此的。</p>

<h3>國際的進步　戰後列強仍有合作可能</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>在這一週內國際上又充滿了妥協的空氣；聯合國大會對於裁減軍備的問題，經過長期討論之後，一再提出折衷辦法，到了最後，中英美法蘇五強的意見，終算漸趨於一致。所成問題的，只剩下一個否決權的問題，蘇聯仍堅持着五強一致的原則，不肯稍讓一步。加以各國對於限制五強行使否決權的辦法也各不相同，所以至今還是國際上的一個賑案。</p>
<p>但是四國外長會議，經過幾次會議之後；却已獲得重大的成就了，四國外長對於巴黎和會所通過的對義·匈·羅·保·芬五國和的草案，業巳完全成立協議。不但法國官方人士對此，表示滿意；而且蘇聯政論家茹科夫也在「眞理報」發表一文，加以稱道，並謂「觀於四國外長會的成功，可知四強通力合作仍屬可能。」惟四國外長會議對於德國問題，因爲法國堅持在比社爾外長抵紐約之前，四國外長會議不得澈底，加以討論。所以外長會議定於本月二十一日舉行取後一次會議，恐怕仍不能加以討論。</p>
<p>兩佔領區實行合併</p>
<p>四國外長會議對於德國問題雖未能加以討論；但是英美兩國佔領區在經濟上實行合併，却由兩國外長在紐約簽訂協定，自明年一月一日起實行。此項協定的內容，歸納起來，有下述各點，（一）共目的在使德國至一九四九年年內，得以自給自足；（二）兩佔領區合併後之進出悶貿易，將由英美兩國聯委員會，加以解決；（三）提高兩佔領區內居民之生活水準，尤其須增加糧食配給的數量；（四）進出悶貿易，如不能平衡，則其入超之數，將由兩國平均負担。</p>
<p>這個協定雖限於英美，但據貝文外相與貝爾納斯國務卿之意，很希望法蘇亦能參加；惟法國認爲此項協定，純屬技術性質，並未能解決整個間題，故拒不參加，並聲明法國對德立塲不變，此在蘇聯，則保守緘默。所以德國問題的解決，要到明年召開四國外長會議時，始能有希望了。</p>
<p>英美締盟愈傳愈盛</p>
<p>英國共產黨每日勞工報突然載稱，英美即將締結軍事同盟條約，這個消息傳出之後，舉世震驚，雖經英國陸軍部予以否認，但是世人心頭的疑竇，仍未能消除。就是工黨議員齊里古斯於八日在英蘇協會發表演說，也以反對英美締結同盟爲言。他說：「目下英美兩國所進行之談判，其結果必將成立同盟，爲反對蘇聯之第三次世界大戰，有所準備。這種秘密外交的做法，和第一次世界大戰前夕成立的英法協商，初無二致」。嬝後他向英國工黨內閣呼籲，對待美蘇，應該一視同仁，不能有所軒輊。</p>
<p>由此可知，英美締盟的傳說愈傳愈盛了。我們當不願這個不利的流言爲事實。因爲目前的世界，還徘徊在十字路口，如果英美締盟以反對蘇聯，則戰後世界分裂爲「兩個世界，」就不可避免的了。而在「兩個世界」的對立下，決無眞正和平可言的。</p>
<h3>日理萬幾減短壽命　做總統不容易</h3>
<p>— 嵐譯</p>
<p>在道裏我們轉載了大都會人壽保險公司統計公報上一張有趣味的表。我們認爲這張表無論誰都不妨一看。</p>
<p>這表上記錄了美國除掉胡佛和杜魯門以外每一個總統的三種事實：他們就職時的年齡，在那時所作的壽命估計，和他們眞眞死亡時的年記。</p>
<p>胡佛和杜魯門兩位先生如今還計好地和我們一同活着，所以對於他們兩人的記錄當然是不能完全的。</p>
<p>看了道張表以後，我們就可以知道做美國的德統，是一個促短壽命的工作。</p>
<p>這張表須分成三個部份研究：（一）一八五〇年以前就職者——從華盛頓到菲爾茅。（二）一八五〇年至一九〇一年問此職者——從菲爾茅到老羅斯福，（三）老羅斯福以後的總統。</p>
<p>在第一組中從華盛頓到泰勒各位總統平均比他們的壽命估計多活二·九年。</p>
<p>在第二組中有林肯，加非爾德和麥金萊三位總統遭受暗殺，因此不能計算在內。至於其餘的人則適與第一組相反，比他們的壽命估計少活二·九年。</p>
<p>最後說到二十世紀中已經逝世的幾位總統，我們發覺除了塔孚脫以外，他們的壽命全都比在就職時所作的估訂短了不少，平均的差數有八歲之多。</p>
<p>當然，正如大都會人壽保險公司幹統計工作的先生們所指出的一樣，「不能單憑這些數字就推斷說今日的總統職位會減短大總統自就職日起的生命，但是這些數字確實是存在的。不論原因何在，事實上一八五〇年以前的總統活得比在他們就職時所作的估訐更長，一八五〇年至一九〇一年間的總統平均少活二·九年，到一九〇一年以後，他們就更此合理的預訐平均提早八年離開人世了。</p>
<p>盡人皆知，總統職使是一椿驚人的艱苦工作，即使對於豁達自負的人如哈定和羅斯福亦屬如此，並且它的煩重性還正在與日俱增之中。　凡此種種均足以支持我們以前曾作的一項建議，即每一個總統候選人均須在選舉前好好地經過一次體格檢查。</p>
<p>道樣做的目的在盡可能範園以內保證選舉人不去選一個將死的人，當一九四四年他們三選羅斯福連任的時候，確實這樣做過。</p>
<p>或者更進一步，照曾經爲人屢决建議的那樣，更將憲法加以修改，限制每一位總統都只能做一任六年。絕無連任或退職後經過一個時期重行當選的可能。</p>
<p>這種每人只能做一任的限制好處是使每一位總統在白宮內專心爲全民謀福利，不再分心於計劃重行當選的政治活動。事實上現在每一位總統都在這樣做。</p>
<p>無論如何，我們相信上面這張表有力地支持了大家認爲「總統職位殺人」的信念。接下去的推論乃是總統只是一個身體康健精力充沛的人纔能拒當的職位，此外，他並且還應當有相當長的壽命預計。</p>

<h3>在恭浦爾古堡裏</h3>
<p>— 法·夏多白里昂著　大椿譯</p>
<p>在恭蒲爾古堡裏住着四位主人：父親，母親，姊姊和我。我們的僕人有這幾個：一個廚娘，一個侍婢，兩個男僕和一個軍夫。除此之外，還有一頭獵狗和兩隻年老的牝馬，關在廠舍的一角裏。</p>
<p>我的父親每天四時起身，冬季也是如此。他起身後，走到內院塔梯的入口處，喊醒他的僕役。五點鐘，送給他一些咖啡。早餐後，他一直坐在書齊裏工作到中午。我的母親和姊姊在早晨八時，各人在自己底房裏推早餐。我沒有一定的時候，起身和早餐都無定時；我裝模作樣地研習到正午；大半的時間，我不做什麼。</p>
<p>十一時半，已敲中飯的鏟，但那飯是要在午時端上的。大應是兩用的，亦作飯應亦作客廳。吃中飯和晚飯坐在應的東首，飯後，搬到另一頭－西首去，坐在一個大火爐前。</p>
<p>我們吃好中飯，一起留在那裏直到二點鍍。二點後，當夏天，父親的消遣不外釣魚，視察菜國，或在古堡周圍散步；秋天和冬天，他去打獵。我的母親呢，到家庵裏去念經，要費去幾小時……</p>
<p>待父親出去，母親去念經後，姊姊　茜耳就關在她房裏，我回到我的斗室中，或到野外去瞎跑。</p>
<p>八時，鐘報晚餐。晚餐後，每逢睛天，坐在石階。父親拿了獵槍，朝着那在傍晚時鑽出雉堞來的貓頭　射擊。母親，呂茜耳和我注視着天，樹林，最後的日光，初出的昆點。在十點鐘，我們回到屋裏睡覺。</p>
<p>秋季和冬季的晚上，是在另外一種方式裏過去的。吃好了晚飯，我們四人從食桌上退到火爐附近，母親嘆息着躺在一張暹羅光布的舊榻上；在她面前放一只獨腳圓桌，上面點一技蠟燭。我同呂茜耳坐在火爐旁，僕人撤去了食具，退出大廳。父親開始踱方步，直到睡時爲止。他穿着一件白縐布的睡衣，差不多是一件大外套，他包在裏面，我委實看不見。他底牛禿的頭，筆整地戴着一只白色的無簷大帽。他離開火爐，在這個被那唯一的蠟燭照亮的大廳裏散步；他走遠時，我們簡直看不見他，僅聞得在昏暗中的腳步聲；隨後，他慢慢地向亮光處踱來，漸漸地由昏暗中顯現，好像一個幽靈，穿着白色的睡衣，戴着白色的便帽，他底長面孔是蒼白色的。他在大廳的另一頭時，呂茜耳和我，我們輕輕地談幾句話；待他走近來，我們便住口了。他走過我們面前時，問道：「你們在說什麼？」我們被畏怕窒息住，不去回答他；他繼續走着。晚上的餘暇，耳中祗聞到他底齊整的腳步聲，母親的嘆息，和風聲。</p>
<p>古堡裏的時鐘報了十下，父親停住步，那鐘裏擊打發條的鎚子停止時，好像把他的腳也吊住了。父親摸出身邊的錶，旋足了發條，拿一只大燭臺，上面點着一枝大蠟燭，往西樓去（註一）繼而回來，手裏拿着燭合到東樓的臥室裏去。呂茜耳和我站在他必經的地方，向他擁抱，祝他安睡。他俯下乾枯而凹陷的而頰，不說什麼，繼續走他的路，走到樓底，我們聽見他隨手關好了門。</p>
<p>那種曾經打斷的情趣——母親，姊姊和我，當父親在塲時，都變成了石像，重新恢復了。最要緊破除我們的東縛，把話匣子開放起來。</p>
<p>我們談了一會，我喚侍婢來，一同伴送母親和姊姊到她們底房裏去。在我離去之前，她們總要呌我在床底下，火爐裏，門背後，棋梯口，過道裏和附近的走廊裏看看。因爲這個古堡曾經留下許多傳說，盜賊呀，幽靈呀，時常佔住在她們的腦裏。居民們相信從前有一個恭蒲爾伯爵，距今已死了三個世紀，有一個時期常常帶了一只木腳顯身，有人曾在堡樓的大扶梯口遇見他，有時單是他底木腳和一隻黑議出來散步。這些傳說，當母親和姊姊睡時，總來到她們底腦裏，她們绱在床上總嚇得半死半活。我替她們巡察了一下，就到我的小樓上；廚娘到大樓上去睡覺，那些男僕走下他們住的地道去。</p>
<p>我住的小樓上的窗是向內院開的，在白晝，我遠望對面古堡正面的凸字壁，那裏生着幾棵Scolopenores（註二）和一株野李樹。每逢夏天，幾只沙燕呌着　人牆洞裏去；他們是我惟一的儔伴。晚上，我只　得見一小塊天和幾顆星。當那月亮照着，她底光輝穿透了窗上的斜方玻璃，投在我床上的時候，我便知道她已落西了。那時，貓頭騰從這個塔上飛到那個堪上，在月亮和我之間經過復經過，我的帳十上畫着翅數的活動影子。我是睡在最荒野的一部份，黑暗裏的風聲不會在我耳中遺失的。有時，風彷彿在輕移蓮步；有時，牠發出怨恨之聲，突然我的門也激烈地搖動了，地道裏發出吼聲，滬些聲音靜止了片刻，一問兒又來了。</p>
<p>早晨四時，父親在百年的弓形部入口處，喊僕人，好像是夜間最後的幽靈底聲音。這種聲音我覺得正可比蒙田的父親喚醒他的兒子的和聲（該三）。</p>
<p>註一：父親的書齋在西樓，臥室在東樓。</p>
<p>註二：是一種業如舌頭的羊齒植物。</p>
<p>註三：蒙田的父親在早晨玩着樂器，喚醒他的兒子</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　119</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>鶴見仍舊穿着那身禮服，在松島一下火車，便賃了一部出租汽車，直駛田木村，省得叫路人看着，打驚失怪。到了村邊，鶴見下車，沿着山後隱僻小路，走到小源夫人的住宅裏。這裏的風景，一如鶴見六年前所見，毫無變動。除了開門的下女外，頭一個迎着鶴見的乃是菊子；小源夫人的女兒，二十六歲的靑年寡婦。</p>
<p>「哎呀！」菊子又驚又喜的喊了出來，「怎麼沒有先給一封信？」還想說什慶，看見鶴見一臉一身的疲倦，便把要說的話都咽了下去，用衣袖擦着眼淚。</p>
<p>菊子可說是個日本的典型婦女，頭腦不新不舊，恰好跟着日本的一般社會，同一步伐。她長得不美，可也不叫人討厭；十八歲讀完了初級師範，念的幼稚園實騐教育。畢業後做了兩年幼稚園助教，就嫁給一位小學教師，不久就守了寡。因爲哥哥在長崎，另外成家立業，騰下老母一人，太爲孤寂，所以問回到娘家，伴着母親，一長一幼，兩代寡婦，廝守過活。鶴見比她大了幾個月，她稱鶴見爲「玉哥」，又叫地「彗星哥哥」，因爲鶴見不大常來的</p>
<p>這次鶴見突然來了，又是這般打扮，當然十分驚奇；又因爲自己在這六個年頭中，經過了一段小小的人世滄桑，一旦看到這手足一般的異姓骨肉，當然免不了觸動一些離別的傷感。她看見鶴見不說話，本能地知道鶴見需要的是什麼。在五分鐘內，她帮着下女把鶴見所需要的，端正下了——一次溫水浴，一身睡衣，一個整潔的睡處。在鶴見入浴之前，她只輕言低語的說了一句話：「媽上市裏辦點東西去了，三兩小時就可回家。」常識和理智，叫她做得恰合鶴見的心意。</p>
<p>晚上的莫九點多鐘，鶴見才醒了困，因爲睡得安靜酣暢，覺得精神到完全恢復了。他躺在那裏沒有動，房裏也不大亮，只有屋角的小儿上，有着一　低度的小檯燈，燈上有精美的花罩，眾上又蓋有一層綠紗。這是舊日鶴見最喜歡的佈置。偕着這隱微的燈光，他看見牆上的幾張照片，其中的一張，是自己畢業那年，騎在一匹高大白馬上所攝，穿着全副的武裝。另一屋角的衣架上，掛着百己的禮服，禮帽，地上就是自己的皮鞋；一看，就知道服裝巳經整理過，鞋也擦得乾潔。這是預防鶴見還有事，一起身就好穿着起來，旁邊一張小椅上，搭着一件藍底白點的和服，一根腰帶，地上一雙拖鞋。</p>
<p>靜謐極了！僅有遠遠傳來一陣一陣的濤聲；然而，設若不側耳傾聽，這細微幽咽的濤聲，也不大聽得見。</p>
<p>鶴見披上了和服，站在窓日，在繁星映照的微光下，遠眺着那沉默一片的夜景。這些，與六年以前，一模一樣，一點也沒有變動：根據舊日的印象，像溫讀熟書似的，依的仍舊看得出側邊的小山尾子，栽滿了高高低低的黑松，在丘壑特出的地方，就有日本式的小亭，從松林叢中，認出一角，或半面來。山腳底下，一片海灘，反映星光，顯出暗銀色，與遠處墨油一般的海水，掩映成了一種蒼　的對較。這般蒼　的景色，與鶴見眼下抑　的心境，相互調合，反而感覺到一種怡然同情的暢快。</p>
<p>人們在情緒緊張的時候，最妙的方法，是尋覓一個淸靜的處所，把心身一切，儘量鬆弛下來，這樣一緊張的情緒，自然可以放鬆，逐漸恢復心境的平衡。然而在緊張的情緒下，同時又感覺失意，失望，甚而所謀不逸，前途一片漆黑，那失敗的恐怖，在一片心靈上，如同黑影一般，掠來拂去，叫你儘往絕望，甚而自殺的途徑上走；這時最靈最妙的丹方，即是投向母親的懷抱裏，或投向愛人的玉臂裏，或投向知己的同情瞭解裏，儘量的訴說，或是讓她們或他們拿那樣停大的溫情來撫慰你。這樣，無須多大時間，你也可以恢復身心的平衡。</p>
<h3>新子不語</h3>
<p>— 習喜</p>
<p>中國在晉宋之間產生一種民間文學，拿新鮮怪誕的見聞資料編成顧短的隨筆，就是「干實搜神記」劉敬叔「異苑」一類的書。從這種書裏可以看出我們民族的人生哲學，共中有史的發展蛻化的僅迹，而且中國的神怪故事差不多都有一種特性，就是社會制度思想的反映，也可以說是現實的。試拿洪邁的「夷業志」和絕氏「閱微草堂筆記」來看，何異於讀一部宋代和淸代乾隆年開的社會史？</p>
<p>西洋故事却是超現實的多些，有許多地方聞直使人不能置信，但是其中也蘊藏著者很深的哲理，非常耐人尋味。</p>
<p>大的十年前吧，德國有一個女人，未受過高等教育，而能說一稱方言，從沒有人能辨別是那一國的新，後來有幾個研究古文學的教授細細研究，才知道是猶太時代阿拉美因族的語言Aramaic。民族亡而書尚有存者，所以尚能知其一二，但是並無人能說，還個女人居然能流利的說，除掉佛家輪迥之說由前世阿族的人來投生，是難以解釋的。這是一個己故猶太籍德醫Dr.　W61ff在上海時親吿聶雲台氏的話。這一類的事西洋固然也曾有，但無如此不可思議的。譬如民國二十四年世界新聞社巴西通訊云：巴西蕯克拉門多地方，有貧家兒名阿爾美達者，年甫十二，其父母皆智識淺陋，此兒生有異稟，能說及寫一種特別語文，人皆不識，又能自譯成葡萄牙文，文法毫無錯誤，其實彼從未舉過葡文，與此極相似。</p>
<p>最近美國有一個專以筆記見長的出版家Bennett　Cerf記過這樣一件實事。</p>
<p>有兩個女教員從美國的東北部自開汽車作一個縱斷全國的旅行，這天在甘薩斯的原野中天巳晚了而汽車又壞起來，這兩個人是不會修機器的，怎樣辦呢？恰好發見遠處似乎有一所兩層樓的鄉村房屋，於是狼狽蹒跚走到門口輕輕的拍門，誰知毫無反應，知道竟是個空屋，門也未曾下鎖，這兩個人仗著袋中的電筒，發現客廳飯廳都還有相當秩序，設備也還好，只是滿尾都布滿了一層灰塵，是久無人居的現象。他們拾些木柴將壁鑪升起火來，找出毛毯，就在沙發上相攤而臥以待天明，自以爲大得其所了，到了夜深，其中一個忽然恍惚覺得有人進了屋而爲之驚醒，其他一個也不期然而然的同時跳了起來，頓時滿室生寒，聞着一種海水的氣味（這地方離海總有千里之遠）於是又看見一個年輕男子如同游泳一樣浮了進來，分明穿的油布衣靴，而長　上還映著水花，走到鑪邊，一陣在抖，就跪下來了。有一個女人禁不住而發出尖時，這人回顧長一聲，頓然不見。後來晨光漸顯，兩個人愕然互相質間，這分明所見相同，決不是做夢呀，而且細看鑪邊，竟還有一堆鹹水及一根油綠的海草。等到找到汽車修理的人，才知道這屋的主人名牛頓，往東方從事航海已經差不多兩年沒有消息。後來又才知道這人是一九三七四月十四日在RobertB.　Anthony貨船充水手，六星期後遇風沉沒於格林蘭附近，全船的人一齊遇難。至於那根海草，經專家審定的確是海洋中的生物而且是常生在死屍上的。</p>
<p>Cer在美國，很近於中國古代齊諧志怪之流，著作很盛行的。</p>
<h3>兩種文藝批評</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>對文評的一點意見</p>
<p>近代文藝批評的方式有很多種，嬝重要的是歸納批評（Incuctive　Criricism）與判斷批評（JudicaiCriticism)茲略述其要義及相互的關係如下：</p>
<p>聯納批評係應用科學上的歸納法，以客觀的態度，將作品的內容詳細說明，讓讀者去評斷牠的價值。凡含蓄於作品之巾的一切要素，批評家都應把他完全解說出來。歸納批評又可就其歸納方法分爲兩種：一種是與其所批評的作品相終始的，目的在細考作品而順序記述其內容，然後再判定作品的價值，莫爾敦（Moulton）的「戲劇家的莎士比亞」（Shakespeareas　a　DramaticArtist）即爲此種批評的代表。還有一種是不僅在深求作品的內容，更考察作品與其周周環境的關係，目的在考究某種作品與其同時的他種作品比較其價值而定作品的地位。聖柏甫（Sainte-Beuve）和泰因（Taine）均取此種態度。歸納批評的目的，主要的貫澈作品的中心，分析作品的意義歸納成方式，因此又可辨明作品中力（Power）與美（Beauty）的質素，以及作品所包含的孰爲暫時的，孰爲水久的。歸納批評又有一個很大的企圖，這裏應特別提出：說明作家有意或無意的受其指導和支配的各種藝術與道德的原則。</p>
<p>判斷批評係對作家或作品直接給以價值的判斷的一種批評。批評家以固定的標準，判斷作家或作品的價值，他們所處的態度儼如裁判官，非常傲慢。批評家以作品適合於標準之程度如何，而評判其價值的高下。因爲判斷批評注重價值的原故，故又稱價值批評。（Criticism　of　Values）十九世紀末葉英國批評家耶飛萊（Jeffrey）被稱爲這派批評的代表。判斷批評常受兩種條件所限制，（一）一定要經過歸納批評才能下判斷；（二）批評家須視其所表現於判斷中者，爲一己的感情及思想，非作家或作作品的眞相。</p>
<p>關於這兩種批評方式，各有其主張。歸納批評和判斷批評恰巧處於兩個不同的方面，前者者祇須將作品的內容解說（Explain）展開（Unfold）照明（Illuminae）認爲價值自見，無待評判，而後者則只憑批評家一己的好惡，作主觀的判斷。兩者之中，自然以歸納批評較爲客觀。聖柏甫說：「對於我所寫的有充分研究一的人，必以我爲適當的批評者，而且是沒有奉承任何法典的批評者。」因此，他批評某種作品，必先研究作者的全部著者作，研究他的爲人，家庭，及一切生活環境。在精確的研究之後，才說明作品及作者的特質。聖柏甫還只是科學的批評的創始者，而科學的批評的建設者泰因的方法，比聖柏甫還要精密。泰納的批評；從構成藝術的三要素——種族·環境·時代——入手，他認爲每一種藝術作品都不是孤立的，必受他的種族與環境的影響，社會的影饗，與時代精神的影響，在批評任何作品及作者時必須從這些影響，以說明作品及作者的特質。這種態度，實在是很正確的。</p>
<p>歸納批評的方法固然比較客觀，合於科學原則，但我以爲文藝批評不能只偏於說明或判斷一面。因爲文藝批評的功用，必包括批評和判斷兩方面。我的意見，以爲正確的文藝批評，應望是說明和判斷二者之綜合的具體的統一。不過，因爲說明的程序在判斷之先，所以說明較重於判斷，不先詳細地認識內容，則價值是無法判國的。所以歸納批評實爲一切批評的基礎。然而只用歸納批評也還不足以盡文藝批評的能事，文藝作品旣有優劣之分，判斷其價值之高下自然是必要的。我們研究某作品或作家，旣已深悉其內容，當進而評定其價值，或重新評定前人曾經論定的作品，在這種情形之下，我們還是要用判斷批評的。</p>
<p>我所說的歸納和判斷之綜合的具禮的統一是怎樣解說呢？理想的文藝批評，固然少不了說明，但只將外形加以詮索還不算，主要的還須用分析的方法，對作品作具體的分析，一條條的赤裸裸的直率地把內容舖陳出來，不算是好的說明。好的說明應該是含有分析性的。一篇優秀的文藝作品，內容一定是立體的，錯綜的，文藝批評常然也不是表面的說明就可滿意的。如果不用分析的方法，如何可以說明繁複錯綜的作品？至於判斷，那是文藝批評少不了的，但也該力避個人的成見，必須把一己的好惡完全丟棄了，不容有絲毫的獨斷。處處以純客觀的態度，不要稍存唯我獨尊的心理，根據分析內容之所得，視作品反應於客觀社會的真實成分而下相對的評判作品價值的判斷，這樣常然可以不致爲成見及個人的感情思想蒙蔽作品的眞實價值了。</p>
<p>我國的文藝批評這一部門，甚不發達，視創作尤爲落後。即偶見文評書評至多亦僅限於說明，精確的判斷却很少見，與共說這是客觀的傾向，爲了免除武斷和成見，才不下判斷，不如說這是由於我國文藝批評的荒落，批評家還沒有訓練出叫澈的眼光，培養出高超的鑑賞能力，所以正確的，判斷批評還沒有能普遍地建立。裁判官穴吿判決的苛嚴態慶，我們今日不需要，但客觀的相對的作品價值的判斷，我們到是迫切需要的。</p>

<h3>體育塲</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>江灣軍火爆炸，把這座遠東第一的運動塲所燬去了一牛，想到目前，興建的艱難，冬去春來，明年及今後的大規模運動會舉行何處，眞不勝痛心之至。</p>
<p>民國廿三年斥資一百五十萬元所建成的，今日，以萬倍來說，即需一百五十億，何況市政千端待理，民生如此凋敝，何來人力財力？</p>
<p>體育塲的命運，够悲慘納了，廿四年春落成後，僅於是年國慶日，舉行了第六屆全國運動大會一次，發揮了它的威風，以後並未再作過較大的用塲，九年來飽受兵　風霜，十分慘澹。而勝利後又未能加以整理，反而瞎七搭八地堆蔽起軍火，作爲倉庫之用，眞是龍井茶業當飼料，暴殄天物！如今索性來個爆炸，令淞滬戰役八年淪陷所倖免的燬於一且，還不幸道際又何嘗爲體育塲所能意料得到。</p>
<p>事已至此，何以義其後呢？</p>
<p>第一，應該趕緊由市教育當局收回：</p>
<p>第二，籌資修理。（這筆修理費出自賠償，或出自捐募，由主持者會商決定。）</p>
<p>不僅關乎全上海市民的福利罷！市參議會此時實應督促市政當局，積極進行，不容延誤了！</p>
<h3>配給救濟　如此這般</h3>
<p>— 吳漱予</p>
<p>麥爾登　與羊毛毯</p>
<p>復員，復員員當我從重慶拖了家眷經過湖南長沙的時候，那兒的行總湖南分署正在配售美國食用品；什麼奶粉啦，肉類罐頭啦，餅乾啦，一大堆一大堆地從配售站的倉庫裏，滾到配售站門口的馬路上，滾到全長沙市的攤販上和小販們的羅筐裏。最初，我以爲這些洋人吃的東西，是人家弄來發洋財的，一定不太行；後來，經過在朋友們那兒的試騐，才知道這些配售品不僅是價廉，而且又物美。舉例來說：十四磅裝的美國臘肉，祗賣一萬二，味美到我們湖南那著名的湖南臘肉，也祗好退避三舍；一又二分之一磅的梳打餅乾或者一又四分之三磅的甜餅乾，祗賣一千塊錢一盒，此起九如齊的梳打餅乾要賣五千元一市斤，那又不知道好了多少倍；五磅裝的金山奶粉，價錢一萬三，跟本地出產的藕粉差不多；另外，又還有「十人悶糧」，祗得一萬二千五，那是香烟，糖菓，餅乾，罐頭什麼又都全有了。</p>
<p>眼睛看到這些好東西，嘴裏　到這些好東西，於是乎我的老婆對我說：「我們也買一點吧」？我耳朵裏聽了她的話，嘴裏又想起這些東西饞涎欲滴，就毫不猶豫而贊同她的主張：「好！買吧」！計開；十四磅裝美國臘肉三聽，一又二分之一磅裝梳打餅乾八盒，一又四分之三磅裝甜餅乾四盒，五磅裝金山奶粉兩聽，另外，又還打算買『十人口糧」，可是又因爲貨色好，價錢巧就難得買着，託來託去，找到一個在行總湖南分署裏工作的朋友，這朋友最初胝是定說「難得買」，後來逼急了，他搬出一塊檔箭牌：「省參議會趙議長託我們余署長替地買兩份「十人口糧」，到現在也還沒有買得着呢」！</p>
<p>想想這位朋友的話語，雖然有點近於該大；但湖南人有湖南人的性格，也許不至於像上海人那樣隨便吃豆腐吧？而況「十人口糧」裏面的香烟，糖菓，餅乾之類的東西，雖然想得緊；但，一個吃慣了辣椒的人，在沒有妥當方法安置少數的甜肉權頭的時候，我也就祇好暫時放棄了。</p>
<p>到了上海，這兒的什麼配售處，又在配售美國全羊毛軍毯和麥爾登呢這一類的衣料了。想想長沙的配售品，我就忙着登記，又忙着借錢繳款；等到繳款後不到幾天，從報紙上，又看到配售處的啓事，說是優待公教人員，麥爾登呢的配售價，從每碼三萬零七減到二萬五千五。要得！市面上麥爾登呢的售價，已經跌到兩萬八，難道公教人一員的配給品，不應該減低一點嗎？可是，話雖如此，配售處的諸位先生們，能侈根據市面上的跌落，隨時調整價格，這種迅速爽一快的作風，在每一個得實惠的公一教人員的心裏，是應該爲他們豎起一塊長生牌位的。</p>
<p>後來，這些登記繳一款的物品，我還沒有能够拿得到，就爲了個人的私事跑到南京去；等到南京再度回來，事務同志們就吿訴我：『麥爾登呢已經領下來了，祇是軍毯還沒有下文」。我像吃了一顆定心丸，接着就說：「沒有關係」。但等到他們把呢料遞到我的手裏，仔細看：「啊！這怎麼是麥爾登呢」？這時候，我不敢懷疑我們的事務同志舞弊，我到底又浮着笑臉把我心裏想情的話說出來了。</p>
<p>「配售處發下來的，就是這類的貨色」。那事務同志答。</p>
<p>「市面上正在賈着的麥爾登呢，可不是這個呀」！我說。</p>
<p>『市面上賣的是美國貨，這是中國人自己織的」。</p>
<p>這時候，我默然了。我一面在反悔我自己這一次復員到上海來，沒有入境問價，先打聽淸楚就登記繳款購買配售品；一面又埋怨配售處的先生們，旣然是做生意替廠商作經紀人，爲什麼不在配售的辦法上，像賣耗子藥似地多規定一條：「如假包換，不靈還洋」呢？不過，談到「還洋」，最好能够針對物價高漲，幣值日跌的現實，算給比期利息；否則，這一切的辦法，白紙黑字，儘管說是優待公教人員，而實則是弄得公教人員哭笑不得的。</p>
<p>其决，順便談談配售制度的存廢，員役開支，旣然是多付出一筆公精，那就希望它能確實做到有益並眞能優待公教人員，勿坐糜公幣替廠商作經紀人……自然，在主持其事的先生們，也許以爲現在美貨襲來，國貨廠商招架不住，如此如此，旣可得優待公教人員之美譽，復可得救濟廠商，而自己……眞是一箭三　。且日子一久，廠商得救，擁護自然有人；入超減少，論功應該擢升。不過，躭心的是「來日方長」，那看準了的「錦　前程」，誰能保得住不『夜長夢多」呢？妥當辦法，現實一點，則祗有請配售處的先生們，趁早到什麼國貨公司或者國貨展覽商塲賑房間裏去坐坐，那到是更爲實在了。</p>
<p>麥爾登呢，原來如此，羊毛軍毯，已飛至猶太商人辨邊去了。可笑可恨，不能無言；不管是「呢」，是「毯」，這種騙局，我們必須追究！</p>
<p>（按：本刊前載「官方配給麥爾登呢」一文，以爲此之謂麥爾登係眞的美貨麥爾登，故指陳政府應多配國貨，頃悉政府配給之「麥爾登」，僅係冒充美貨，可謂用心良苦，至堪欽佩）！</p>
<h3>徵伴內幕</h3>
<p>— 巧生</p>
<p>一天，某報的分類廣吿裏，刊有微伴廣吿一則：「×小姐年二十歲，品貌兼優，性情溫和。茲願徵求男友一位，凡年在廿三歲至廿六歲，具有大學程度，身家淸白者，皆可投函××信箱二三五號，合者面談」。</p>
<p>第二天，立刻就收到了很多很多的應徵信，應徽者都是說自己是如何的美貌，學問又是如何的高深，家中又是怎樣的宮有……。</p>
<p>幾天以後，應徽者都收屬了一封信，大意是說：不知對方學問程度如何，故請撰情書一封。</p>
<p>於是應徵者大動其腦筋，一心一志的寫成一封十全十美的情書，以博會晤「品貌兼優，性情溫科」的美人。甚至有的出後門，尋代筆，同時必恭必敬的膽上了信箋，鄭重其事地投入了郵筒　。於是祗等佳音的光臨；可是，奇怪得很，這封情畫眞好似石投大海，一無音訊。</p>
<p>數月後，報上刊有××書店的一則廣吿，原來是××博土的巨大新貢獻—情書大全出版了！</p>
<p>意外地，數月前的那批應徽者的「情書大作」，都排成了鉛字，刊在上面！可惜的是作者不是你而是××博土了！</p>

<h3>叫化子的組織12</h3>
<p>— 黃</p>
<p>真假難民</p>
<p>「撩地帮」便是老弟兄丐琉在街頭的　局之一，那是一種集團求乞的巴戲。但因其目的祗仕求人自動佈施，故雖是設下圈套，却又並非犯法的勾當。其集團的組織法，乃是從丐帮中選據男婦老幼六七人，宛如一家人模樣，父母子媳俱全。如能拚湊上一個白髮鷄皮的老太婆，允合理想。其組成法有如劇團之選派演員，確也須費過一番心血。我國戰亂頻年，荒災無時無之。加以日寇侵擾多年，內地難民逃滬日多。真性難民流　載這，遂給眼明手快的老弟兄丐帮利用機會，把原班乞丐組成假難民，以吸收社會人士的佈施金，凡從事於「撩地」者，衣服須破敝但不襤褸，以免被明眼人看出是乞丐化身。等到路人佇立團觀，愈聚愈眾。於是大家哭喪着臉，其中自有一個能言的主角，以發言人的姿態，將悲惻動人的聲音，向觀眾訴述鄉里的災況，或是遭難經過的慘狀。背鄉離井來滬，不料投親不遇，資斧用盡，一家老少幾天不得飯吃，哀求觀眾佈施等情。路人便擲給錢鈔，不佈施者只好逡巡走開。而路人來往眾多，所以得資也很可觀。等到日暮結帳，除提出一成給予當地的爺叔丐頭外，餘數的分配法，厚薄各有等差，並不是按照人數平均分配的。例如主角得酬自　，年老者物以稀爲責，也自不容菲薄，其餘的閒角，個中人稱爲「麻將搭十」，都屬俯拾即是的庸材，少給了也不怕他們辭職求去。其中最名貴的乃是飾演白髪祖母的老且角，因爲丐帮中此類人才最缺，又不能以年輕人化裝冒充。都須是貨眞價實的正號鶴皮。一集團中有了這麼一位老壽星，得錢最爲可觀。這是深懂觀眾心理的一個江湖訣竅。誰無父母，況是白髮老婦？推已及人，難免起了惻穩之心。不過此種集團也時常在變動之間。某丐本週在甲組，下週也許就混入乙組。雖說其情也屬可憫，但因不脫欺騙手法，而且以假亂眞，結果反使眞性難民無人佈施。實屬可惡！</p>
<p>此種「據地」丐帮，其起源甚平，路人司參見慣，便漸漸地看穿了個中內慕，佈施的也就少了。而且專難口頭實傳，有時反不如文字宣傳的利便，於是花樣翻新，又有「白頭生意」繼之而興。這便是滬靈所稱的「吿地狀」。此帮須有一人略識文字，將一枝粉筆先在街頭畫地求乞。滿塗哀辭，娓娓動聰。所謂斯文掃地，其此之謂乎？但有時求乞者胸無點墨，祗得請「馬路人」起好陳稿，擬定詞句，再由略識「之乎者也」的丐流博聞強記，依樣寫在地上。更乾脆的辦法，便是在大濟早行人稀少之時，請一位落魄文人先題好字，再講丐流站崗。冒充爲自己的傑作。文人却早得稿費隱退去了。誰想丐流還請得起秘書郎呢？行人來來往往，誰也不去窮結其底蘊，祇認爲文士窮途，莫不慷慨施捨。在初時此類求乞頗爲見利，可是日久漸露破綻。而且隨時可見，再難吸收錢鈔了！</p>
<p>低調</p>
<h3>預言</h3>
<p>— 江流</p>
<p>財部爲了加強國庫收入，現擬開征「特殊財富稅」，其課稅對象中有一種是：開彩得中首獎者，一律課以熏稅。並且聽說執行極嚴，如漏報不實，即沒收其全部財產。預料不久上海將有「秘密摸彩」新的花樣出現，廣吿上也必將標榜：保證顧客不致「偷鷄不着蝕把米」！</p>
<h3>「糾士」笑了</h3>
<p>— 華士</p>
<p>據說因爲上海不景氣，一月來此間富商官僚的資金紛紛逃避香港，總數已達三百億元以上，香港、工商業國而倒蓬勃日甚。儘管英國在深圳慘殺張添祥，中國人還是趨之惟恐不及，誰說市儈們可惡？他們確實肩負啓一敦睦邦交，化戾氣爲祥和的偉大抱負吶！</p>
<h3>建議</h3>
<p>— 却酬</p>
<p>存在南洋的剩餘物資，又要大批來了。我向上海市當局建議：盡量開闢臨時市塲，容納攤販，不然的話，上海玻璃市價又要像火箭式的高升了。</p>
<h3>民意</h3>
<p>— 中毅</p>
<p>假知我也是一位國大代表，那我一定主張定都江蘇江都，因爲那是鄙人的家鄉。</p>
<p>常識測驗</p>
<h3>且談關金劵</h3>
<p>— 丁一厂</p>
<p>一個國家的鈔票有如之多的樣式，恐怕再沒有比中國更多的吧！即使我們不就銀行錢莊的人物，每天爲了生活，總有好些張各種各式的鈔票在手中來去。假使那是一張直版挺新的鈔票，閒了來時，憑一個放大鏡或者你精銳的目力，探索一下，將會有許多花樣和妙不可言的「秘密」被你發現，其題味，我以爲不在「某郵」之下。</p>
<p>這裏且先舉出「關金」票作爲例子，寫下十倏間題，希望「自由談」的讀者們大家來試試。其中包括些一般常識相印刷常識。這一次，我們很難定得下一個標準說最少要答中幾題。不過和朋友家人一起的分別猜答，互相比較，仍是最好的量度。</p>
<p>閒題道入條題目，請單憑記憶力思索來回答，不必掏出幾張關金票來「按圖驥索」。</p>
<p>（一）中央銀行兌出來一紮紮原封未動的全新直版「關金票」，當你小心地循例也得點點張數是否足够百張一疊時，就有一股令人頗爲快感的香味衝進鼻尖。誰說是「銅　」呢！但我想問問這股香味見來自何處，你以爲是因爲：</p>
<p>Ａ，鈔票由美逐華時，適與橘子香蕉之類放在同一個船艙麼？</p>
<p>B，剛剛是某一位太太從手提包內掏出的存款，故「猶有餘杳」麼？</p>
<p>Ｃ，抑或，是印刷油墨中一種特殊溶解劑的氣味呢？</p>
<p>（二）「關金票」的表面和底面，常常有疏疏落落的紅，黃，藍顏色小圓點子。你以爲這是：</p>
<p>Ａ，印刷在紙面上增加美觀麼？</p>
<p>Ｂ，「關金票」所獨有的暗號磨？</p>
<p>Ｃ，抑或，製造鈔票紙時，就混入紙製的小圓形顏色紙片，以妨假冒呢？</p>
<p>（三）除了文字以外，無論表面或底面，每張「關金票」的圖案，你以爲是：</p>
<p>Ａ，左右兩半，完全相同嗎？</p>
<p>B，左右兩半，完全不相同嗎？</p>
<p>Ｃ，抑或，大體處相同，但細微處却大有分別呢？</p>
<p>（四）關於各種票面額不相同的「關金票」，其票面面積的大小，照你的記憶，以爲是：</p>
<p>Ａ，完全相同呢？</p>
<p>B，數額愈大的面積愈大呢？</p>
<p>Ｃ，抑或，除了數額最大的三種是相同以外，其餘小額的則票面額愈大票面積亦愈大呢？</p>
<p>（五）你相信麽：在「關金票」正面，孫中山先生遺像的橢圓形框子花邊之內，隱藏有好幾個英文字母麽？你能解釋它的意義麽？</p>
<p>（六）無論在正面的孫中山先生遺像旁，抑或背面中央銀號照片的圖形內，都隱藏有一個英文「Ｃ」字放在一個經不及半公厘的圓圈子裏，這Ｃ字的意義，你以爲是：</p>
<p>Ａ，「版灌所有，不許複製」的問寫呢？</p>
<p>Ｂ，「美國鈔票公司」的簡寫呢？</p>
<p>Ｃ，抑或，繪圖人的簽名呢？</p>
<p>（七）「關金票」的票號是六位數字，其前再添以兩位英文字頭，以票面額是五十元即法幣一千元的「關金票」算，假如第一張是「ＡＡ〇〇〇〇〇〇」，最後一張是ＺＺ999999，其中並無隔斷，請問共值國幣若十？你能在兩分鏟內在下面三個數字裏選中一個適合的數字麽？</p>
<p>Ａ，六七六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>Ｂ，七五六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。</p>
<p>Ｃ，七百億兀。</p>
<p>答過上頭八條題，下頭剩下的兩題，請掏出一張關金「玩味」一番再來作答吧：</p>
<p>（八）各種印刷術歸納起來，不外乎「凸版」「平版」「凹版」三種，但平常我們所看到的一張張各種印刷品，頗難兼備三者的。惟有在「關金票」及某些有價證券則凸·平·凹版供全。請問關金票如下的三部份印刷，那一項是屬於那一種印刷術呢？請將「凸·平·凹」三字適宜地填在括號之內！</p>
<p>Ａ，正面和底面顏色相同而且所佔面積最廣的部份（）</p>
<p>B，正面孫先生遺像正中下那一塊顏色最多而變化亦最大的部份（）</p>
<p>Ｃ，紅色票號碼和兩塊紅色四方印章（）</p>
<p>（九）細心的人或許早已察知：在各種票面額不同的「關金票」中，紙面之空白處總帶有一些極淡極淡的顏色。比方百元二百元的帶點淺灰，四百元的帶點淺錄，而「紫關金」「紅關金」亦分別帶些淡紫或淡紅。莫由理你以爲是因爲：</p>
<p>Ａ，所用的鈔票紙紙色不同呢？</p>
<p>B，平版印刷時原版弄污了呢？</p>
<p>Ｃ，抑或，凹版印刷時印鈔油　的餘痕呢？</p>

<h3>The Constitutional Review Committee's Multi-Day Meetings Lead to Rapid Progress in Constitution-Making; Youth and Social Democratic Parties Speak Actively</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Constitutional Draft Review Committee will continue its meetings on the 11th, morning and afternoon. The morning session, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, will address ten articles in total: Articles 1, 2, 3, and 4 (divided into three groups), 5, 6, and 7 (divided into two groups). The afternoon session, from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, will address six articles in total: Articles 2, 3, and 4 (divided into three groups), and 6 and 8.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The preamble to the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China, after repeated debates over several meetings of the First Review Committee, was passed in its original form at the committee's third meeting on the afternoon of the 10th. The original text is as follows: "The National Assembly of the Republic of China, entrusted by all the people, based on the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in founding the Republic of China, in order to consolidate national sovereignty, protect civil rights, ensure social stability, and promote the welfare of the people, hereby enacts this Constitution, promulgates it throughout the country, and forever adheres to it." Furthermore, regarding Article 1 of the General Principles, only a minority in the meeting advocated maintaining the original text. During the final vote, all those present favored amending it and voted on the five proposed amendments that had been compiled. Of the 129 people present, 58 voted to change the article to "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic based on the Three Principles of the People," which was the largest number, but still not a majority. Discussions will continue on the 11th.</p>
<p>Today's meeting was held at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM, chaired by Li Junfu of the Social Democratic Party. 134 people were present, including Zhang Ji and Zhang Mojun. The first decision was that the Review Committee would no longer be divided into three groups for discussion but would conduct collective reviews. Following this, the "Preamble" was discussed. The chairman reported that the assembly had received a total of five proposals related to the "Preamble." Representatives then spoke and discussed, focusing on the phrase "based on the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in founding the Republic of China." However, the differences were only in wording, with no major changes to the original meaning. Zhang Zhiben and others advocated maintaining the original proposal, and Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party no longer insisted on whether to use the word "based." The original proposal was ultimately voted to be maintained. Next, the meeting proceeded to discuss Article 1 of the General Principles: "The Republic of China is based on the Three Principles of the People and is a democratic republic of the people, by the people, and for the people." Regarding this article, the assembly had received a total of 24 proposed amendments, which were categorized into five major types by the convener, Huang Shaogu. The most important of these was to change it to: (1) "The Republic of China is a Republic based on the Three Principles of the People" (i.e., the original text of the May 5th Draft Constitution) (2) "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic based on the Three Principles of the People" (with the addition of "Democratic" compared to the former). Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party believed that the original text of the May 5th Draft Constitution should not be restored, as this Draft Constitution was an amendment to the May 5th Draft Constitution by the government, proposed after government research, and therefore the original proposal should be maintained. Another Youth Party representative, Zhou Baosan, opposed adding phrases such as "Three Principles of the People" to the Republic, believing that it was rare in other countries to crown the form of government with an ideology, hoping not to leave people with the impression of a one-party monopoly. Another representative of the party, Min Da, said that if the amendment was passed by the Review Committee, the party would respect the principle of the minority obeying the majority but would reserve the right to speak, to speak at the assembly regarding the point of adding "Three Principles of the People." Wu Yanhuan said that adding it did not have a partisan color, and Tong Hangbai also believed that adding "Three Principles of the People" did not mean a one-party monopoly; the consultation draft also contained the words "Three Principles of the People." Qiu Jianyuan also said that foreign countries do not add an ideology, so why can't we be unique? Several representatives advocated adding the word "Democratic" to "Republic." Chen Guyuan said that he had come today specifically to advocate adding the word "Democratic," as economic democracy is the people's livelihood. Zhang Mojun also did not oppose adding the words "People's Rights" but said that what we are adding is "True Democracy." An Qingting said that adding the two words could reassure those who are suspicious. Female representative Zhang Xiulan and others opposed adding the word "Democratic," believing that with the Three Principles of the People, the meaning of the word "Democratic" was already included. Pi Yishu believed that adding the two words was like gilding the lily. Wu Yanhuan believed that the word "Democratic" was interpreted differently by different parties, with each person having their own saying, so it was better not to add it. Another representative gave a literal interpretation, saying: the "People" in the four characters "Republic of China" already has the meaning of democracy, and except for Turkey and Spain, very few countries in the world add the word "Democratic" to the form of government in the constitution. Finally, it was voted whether the original proposal should be amended, and all present favored amending the original proposal. Based on the five amendments summarized by Huang Shaogu, it was voted. Of the 129 people present, 11 voted to change it to "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic," 43 voted for the original text of the May 5th Draft Constitution, 26 voted for "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic based on the Three Principles of the People," and 58 voted to change it to "The Republic of China is a Democratic Republic based on the Three Principles of the People." Although the latter received the most votes, it did not reach a majority. It is reported that discussions will continue at the fourth meeting at 9:00 AM on the 11th. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Sixth Constitutional Draft Review Committee held its fourth review meeting at the Overseas Chinese Guest House at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, with 83 representatives in attendance, chaired by Xiang Jutan. The review process began, and the second item was to discuss the articles of Chapter 11 of the Constitutional Charter and the amendments proposed in the proposals, with a total of nine proposals. The reasons for the proposals were: (1) Bai Yunti et al. proposed to supplement and amend the Draft Law of the Republic of China's Party in order to maintain the hearts of the border people and consolidate national defense. (2) Zhen Guyuan et al. proposed to change the chapter "Provincial and County System" to "Local System," and to add "The autonomy of the Mongolian and Tibetan areas shall be determined by law according to their inherent conditions and needs" after the section on provinces. (3) Pu Ru et al. proposed to include the Manchu people in the constitution in accordance with the principles of five ethnic groups coexisting in harmony and ethnic equality, according to the methods of the Mongolian and Tibetan ethnic groups. First, the name of Chapter 11: "Provincial and County System" was changed to "Local System." After voting, the majority had no objection, and the name was changed to "Local System."</p>
<p>The decision was that for cases related to the province, several representatives spoke to maintain the original proposal and not to change it. Zheng Yan Cai then stood up to explain the case he proposed in 337, first, to change the chapter title of Chapter 11 "Provincial and County System" to "Local System"; second, that this chapter should not be divided into sections; third, to stipulate in detail the basic principles of the general rules for provincial and county autonomy. The chairman then summarized the opinions of the various proposals into four categories: (1) This chapter is not divided into chapters and sections. (2) Divided into continents but not provinces. (3) Divided into administrative regions. (4) Maintain the original proposal. After voting, the majority voted to maintain the original proposal and passed it.</p>
<p>Then, Article 114 was discussed item by item. The original text was: "The province may convene a provincial people's representative assembly and formulate a provincial autonomy law based on the general rules of provincial and county autonomy, but it shall not conflict with the constitution." Divided into three key points: (1) Provincial autonomy (2) General rules of provincial and county autonomy (3) Formulation of provincial autonomy law. It was discussed immediately. Some advocated canceling the "General Rules of Provincial and County Autonomy," some advocated canceling the "Provincial People's Representative Assembly," and some advocated canceling the "Provincial Senate." The discussion was heated, and there was no result until 6:00, and it was decided to hold the fifth meeting at 10:00 AM on the 11th to continue the discussion.</p>

<h3>The Fourth Review Committee Argues Fiercely Over the Right of Consent of the Control Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Fourth Constitutional Draft Review Committee held its third plenary session at the Public Recreation Club at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 10th, with more than 70 representatives in attendance, chaired by Gao Yihan. The audience discussed Article 95 of Chapter 9 of the Constitutional Draft Amendment, the right of consent of the Control Yuan, for quite a long time. Some representatives believed that since the Control Yuan already has the power of impeachment, prior consent is unnecessary; otherwise, the exercise of the right of consent could prevent the Control Yuan from transcending partisanship. Other representatives believed that the power of the Control Yuan was not too great, and only the right of consent to the President of the Judicial Yuan, Grand Justices, and Examination Committee members should be retained. The two sides argued fiercely, and the meeting was adjourned at around 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>Argument Arises in the Review Committee; Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Ding Cuying Requests Medicine to Be Included in the Constitution; Fu Sinian Strongly Argues That Science Is Medicine</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] Anyone who is not forgetful should remember the story of Fu Sinian and Kong Geng pounding the table and roaring in the Senate over the issue of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, almost resorting to violence. At the meeting of the cultural and educational subgroup of the Seventh Review Committee on the 10th, Fu Sinian and Ding Zhongying had another big argument. Proposal No. 146 was submitted by Zheng Manqing et al., 44 people in total, "For the case that medicine should be included in Article 45 of the Constitution." Ding Zhongying, a famous doctor from Shanghai and one of the cosigners, stood up to explain. Ding was wearing a melon-skin hat, a wide robe, a long cashmere scarf around his neck, and a pair of large black round-rimmed glasses on his nose, dressed in national quintessence from head to toe. He said, "For culture, new and good things should be absorbed, and old and good things should also be promoted. Traditional Chinese medicine does not cut open the abdomen or amputate legs, but still treats diseases. It should not be obliterated. This is related to the survival of the country and must be listed in the Constitution." As soon as he finished speaking, Fu Sinian stood up immediately. Ding understood in his heart, so he stood there, cupped his sleeves over his ears, and straightened his throat to listen to Fu say: "First, doctors are free professionals. If their medical skills are high and their reputation is great, they can make money without the need for protection. Second, medicine should be science. Science is clearly stipulated in Article 145, so why list it again? I think that the issue of traditional Chinese and Western medicine should not be discussed in the National Congress again. I propose to retain this proposal." He was wearing a suit and a coat, holding a pipe in his hand, completely Westernized. Ding waited for Fu to finish speaking, then pulled down his scarf and shouted loudly, "I object to what this gentleman said. At the same time, I personally believe that Chinese people know too little about medicine and feel deeply pained. Traditional Chinese medicine is a combination of philosophy and science. Saying that medicine is science is to destroy traditional Chinese medicine. Those who do not understand traditional Chinese medicine, speak nonsense..." At this time, Chairman Hu Shuhua said, "Please do not talk about things outside the topic." Ding trembled with anger, "I won't talk about it, okay." So Chairman Hu sought everyone's opinion on how to handle this proposal. Someone suggested merging it with Proposal No. 161 and transferring it to the social security and health administration subgroup. Ding jumped up, "Let me say one more thing." Fu also jumped up, "Chairman, if he says it again, I have something to say too." He pushed his coat aside, put the pipe in his mouth, and sat down. Everyone said, "Don't say it." The dispute ended in laughter, and Ding had no choice but to sit down angrily. Later, the audience decided to transfer it to the social and health subgroup.</p>

<h3>Debates Among Representatives Over the Fine Points of Wording - A Sideline Account of the Constitution Drafting Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] During the meeting of the First Review Committee, there was no shortage of quibbling over the fine points of wording. Participants often argued back and forth over a single word or phrase. The most intense debate was over whether to use "based on the teachings" or "in accordance with the teachings" in the "Foreword," and especially whether to add the word "democratic" to the first article. Chen Yuanyuan strongly advocated changing the first article to "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People," stating, "I am attending this meeting today solely to argue for the two words 'democratic'," and explaining that the Principle of People's Livelihood is economic democracy. Ren Chexuan also rose to explain, but Di Ying, impatient to listen, quickly called out, "The bell has rung twice already, don't say any more." Pi Yishu and others opposed adding the word "democratic," believing that adding it would be "gilding the lily." Zhang Zhiben believed that adding foreign terms like "government of the people, by the people, for the people" to the first article would be equivalent to using "foreign goods to resist domestic goods." Another representative also stated: "If a great nation has something, I don't necessarily have to have it. If a foreign nation doesn't have something, why can't I create it uniquely?"</p>
<p>The First Review Committee meeting experienced two power outages. Representatives spoke in the dark, their voices heard but their faces unseen, resembling a movie theater during a power outage. Representatives from the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party spoke very actively in the First Review Committee. Yu Jiaju, Min Da, Xia Erkang, Zhou Baosan, and others all spoke, explaining their respective parties' views on the draft constitution and making some concessions. The chairman of the meeting, Li Junfu, also a member of the Social Democratic Party, nearly stormed out of the meeting due to accusations from some representatives, but was persuaded to stay by Huang Shaogu, Chen Yiyun, and others. The atmosphere at today's meeting was indeed quite heated. Often, five or six hundred people simultaneously requested to speak, calling out their seat numbers, as chaotic as an auction house in Shanghai. Without Huang Shaogu's calm analysis, order would have been nearly impossible to maintain.</p>
<p>When the first article was put to a vote, Chairman Li Junfu read out the various proposals, but his voice grew softer and softer. The representatives raised objections, and Li said, "I am hoarse; my voice is already gone." However, his tone gradually became higher towards the end. A representative told a story in the meeting, saying: "Zhang Zongchang once advocated the Four People's Principles to counter the Three Principles of the People. His so-called Four People's Principles were the four classes of people: scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants." Everyone laughed after hearing this.</p>
<p>The Third Review Committee was chaired by Wang Shijie. Because the conveners, Pan Gongzhan and others, had done thorough and complete preparatory work, and Chairman Wang handled matters in an orderly manner, the meeting proceeded very smoothly. They discussed and voted on each article in a harmonious and cooperative manner, without wasting time or engaging in acrimonious disputes. It can be said that it was the most reasonable review meeting.</p>
<p>A cold wave from Siberia has arrived again. The water on the ground freezes in the mornings and evenings. Fires are lit in every meeting place, making it feel warm as spring inside. However, the plenary hall was neither heated nor equipped with radiators. The Second Review Committee, which met there in the morning, ended quickly. The Seventh Review Committee's Education and Culture Subcommittee, which met there in the afternoon, also felt cold and deserted. One proposal after another was passed, with few heated moments.</p>
<p>In the morning meeting of the Seventh Review Committee's National Defense and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, He Guoguang and Leng Xin engaged in a fierce "struggle" over whether soldiers could join political parties. He said: "The army is the army of the nation. Since it cannot interfere in administration, it should be above factions." Leng said: "Soldiers are also citizens and should enjoy the freedom to believe in ideologies and exercise political power." As a result of the debate, the first half of Article 134 was not changed, and He was victorious.</p>
<p>During the afternoon discussion of Article 137, the proposed amendment to the constitution regarding foreign policy, two Catholic tycoons, Yu Bin and Pan Chaoying, stood out. Yu Bin, filled with the fervor of a religious leader, appealed for international justice on the one hand, opposing the use of power politics, and pleaded for the interests of 20 million overseas Chinese on the other, demanding that provisions to protect overseas Chinese be explicitly stated. Pan Chaoying, a scholar of international affairs, requested that the United Nations Charter not be rigidly stipulated in our constitution, so as to avoid constitutional amendments caused by modifications and changes in international law. As a result, both men achieved all their goals.</p>

<h3>The American China Policy Association Sternly Condemns Fan Xuande's Letter to Byrnes Requesting Denial of Fan's Statement That It Was Rude to Ambassador Gu and Should Apologize</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] The American China Policy Association (Chairman is Powell) today released the full text of a letter sent by the Association to Byrnes on the 6th, requesting that the State Department deny the statement made by Fan Xuande, Director of the Far East Division of the State Department, on November 11 regarding China, and apologize for Fan's rudeness towards Gu Weijun. The letter stated: "Fan Xuande said that we believe it would be unwise to invest public or private capital in a nation or government that is corrupt, wastes resources excessively on armaments, is threatened by civil war, or has a government that intentionally despotic and wants to reject American merchants, or has no democratic ideas"! "This kind of irony can largely be applied to countries around the world today." "However, Fan Xuande's statement only specifies one country, that is, China." "However, there is something even more to be condemned, because when Fan Xuande made this statement, Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, was also present. Gu was unable to refute it on the spot, so he adopted an apparently unresponsive attitude. This is not a good American foreign policy, nor is it the traditional etiquette of the United States towards representatives of friendly countries." Fan's sympathy for the Chinese Communists and his statement, which completely match the policies stated by the Communist newspapers, are obvious. Fan may hope that the United States will stop all loans to the Chinese government, which we can understand, but when the State Department announced its policies and cooperated with its allies, Fan actually made this statement representing the State Department, which we cannot understand. Fan's statement will help create chaos in China. What's more, this statement will prevent the United States from ever lending to any country that violates Soviet policies. The Communist Party in these countries can always create the situation that Fan described, such as losing the civil war, nationalizing industrial countries, and military spending. If we accept this principle, we will inevitably not be able to lend to any country except those praised by the Soviet Union, or even the Philippines. In a letter to President Truman on September 6, the Association requested "reorganization of the Far East Division of the State Department, and that all important positions in the Division be held by those who fully comply with the American Open Door Policy." The Association bluntly told Byrnes: "After Fan was first appointed as the head of the China Section and then promoted to Director of the Far East Division, our long-term observation has convinced us that he does not have the above qualifications." The article concluded: "We only ask that Your Excellency (referring to Byrnes) publicly clarify, deny Fan's statement, and apologize to Gu Weijun for Fan's rudeness."</p>

<h3>Studying the Yellow River Management Plan - Savage and Others Scheduled to Depart for Inspection of the Entire Yellow River Course, Many Chinese Experts Accompany</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Supreme Economic Council, considering the extreme importance of the Yellow River problem, hired American experts in June of this year: Lieutenant General Le Baron, an engineer with the US Army Corps of Engineers; Dr. Savage, a consultant for the Reclamation Bureau; and Mr. Grothe, the chief hydraulic engineer of the Aluminum Corporation, to come to China this year to study and manage the Yellow River. The three American experts arrived in Shanghai on December 2 and are scheduled to depart from Nanjing on the 12th for inspection. Several Chinese experts will accompany them. They will take a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane directly from Nanjing to Wei Yin, then travel along the Grand Canal to the Yellow River, then fly along the old course to Haikou for inspection, and then fly back along the old course to Kaifeng. On the 13th, they will fly upstream along the Yellow River from Kaifeng to Ningxia, stopping for one day to inspect the conditions of various canal projects. On the 15th, they will fly from Ningxia to Lanzhou, and then fly west along the Yellow River to inspect the upper reaches. On the return journey, they will fly over Qinghai and return to Lanzhou, then fly through Tianshui and Baoji to Xi'an.

<h3>Issues Related to Elections in the Draft Constitution (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>Analysis of Proposals Submitted by National Assembly Delegates</p>
<p>The total number of written proposals submitted by the National Assembly delegates is about 400, of which cases 1 to 100 have been printed and distributed by the General Secretariat of the Assembly. This article briefly analyzes the 24 proposals related to elections in these 100 cases to see the hopes of the National Assembly delegates for the constitutional provisions related to elections.</p>
<p>The election issues that the representatives value most are: (1) the occupational electoral system, (2) increasing the number of border representatives in the regional representative system, (3) women's election and being elected, and (4) overseas Chinese electing supervisors and so on. Most representatives hope that the above four points can be expressly stipulated in the constitution to conform to world trends. Of course, there are also dissenting opinions on the above points, but the number is not very large.</p>
<p>(1) Occupational Representative System</p>
<p>The strongest advocates for the occupational representative system are Gu Zhenggang, Ma Chaojun, and Wang Xiaolai and other 528 representatives who proposed Case No. 98. This case lists the following reasons to explain the necessity of adopting the occupational electoral system: (1) Occupational representatives come from all walks of life and can represent the interests of various professional organizations and have a sense of supra-locality; (2) After regional representatives and occupational representatives are elected separately, the people who can best represent occupational consciousness can easily be elected by various industries; (3) Gathering representatives of different occupations from all over the country in one place is easy to achieve the effect of coordination. And it cites that when the National Father went north in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924), he advocated that the National Assembly should adopt a system of occupational representative; when it was officially convened in the twentieth year (1931), it followed this claim and representatives were elected separately by national professional groups to participate in the formulation of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage. The current National Assembly Representative Election Law, the County and City Council Organization and Election Regulations, and the County Councilor Election Regulations all adopt an occupational electoral system. According to past experience, the implementation of this system is beneficial and without disadvantages.</p>
<p>The case "National Assembly Preparatory Committee Draft Constitution Research Association Republic of China Draft Constitution Amendment", proposed by Zi Rui and other 218 representatives, also advocates the adoption of the occupational representative system.</p>
<p>Looking at the 100 proposals, there are eight cases mentioning occupations, of which seven cases agree to this system. The proposers are as many as 974 people (there are some overlaps), accounting for one-half of the total number of representatives, and the proposers Gu Zhenggang and Ma Chaojun are the heads of party and government agencies responsible for guiding the morning industrial and commercial professional groups, and Wang Xiaolai and others are also the chairman of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce. Other representatives are also mostly National Assembly occupational representatives, so they can represent the opinions and requirements of all farmers, industry and commerce. Other regional representatives have also signed to agree. This requirement of the public will definitely be realized.</p>
<p>The only opponent is Case No. 87 proposed by Wang Xuan and other 29 representatives. This case advocates that the National Assembly representatives should only be divided into regional representatives and overseas Chinese representatives, because the above two types of representatives have already included all the people and conform to the legacy of electing representatives by autonomous units to organize the National Assembly. They believe that occupational representatives are not seen in the legacy regarding the National Assembly. The National Assembly advocated in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924) is another matter. In the 100 proposals published this time, there are five cases involving the number of border representatives, of which the most important are (1) Case No. 18 proposed by Bai Yunti and other 222 representatives, (2) Case No. 89 proposed by Huang Zhengqing and other 62 representatives, and (3) Case No. 59 proposed by Yang Zhizhong and other 20 representatives. Bai Yunti and Huang Zhengqing's proposals are for Tibet, and Yang Zhizhong is making demands on behalf of the indigenous peoples of various provinces.</p>
<p>Bai Yunti and others proposed that although the National Assembly. The Legislative and Supervisory branches list the Mongolian clauses, there are many omissions and they are not fully suitable, and should be supplemented. Regarding the electoral part, it is advocated that in Article 26, under "1. by various provinces and Mongolian leagues", add the four words "and special banners"; under "2. by various provincial councils and Mongolian leagues", add the four words "and special banners"; under "3. by the counties", add a "banner" character; the five words "and equivalent to counties" are changed to the four words "and its equivalent". The reason is that the area of ​​each league and special banner is equivalent to a province, and the area of ​​each banner is equivalent to a county.</p>
<p>The original number of Legislative Yuan members was "8 people in total from the Mongolian leagues", but Bai and others advocated changing it to "30 people in total from the Mongolian leagues, departments and special banners". The reason is that there are 13 leagues and departments in total, and there are special banners that do not belong to the leagues and departments. The area of ​​each league and department is very large. If it is set to 8 people, there will be less than one person per league and department, which is too few. Furthermore, the status of the league and department is the same as that of a province. The province with the smallest population has 5 members of the Legislative Yuan. It is not too much to increase the total number of Legislative Yuan members from the league and banner to 30. The number of supervisors is also proposed to increase from 8 to 17.</p>
<p>Huang Zhengqing and others' proposal intends to clearly stipulate in the constitution the National Assembly representatives, Legislative Yuan members and supervisors that the Tibetan region under the province should elect. It is advocated that in Article 26 of the draft constitution, the words "and Tibetan areas under the province" should be added under "Tibet" in each paragraph. In addition to the original 8 Tibetans in the Legislative Yuan, "8 Tibetans under the province" are added, and 8 supervisors are also added.</p>
<p>The reason is that the "Tibetan region" generally refers to the front and back Tibet. In fact, there are Tibetan people living in certain places in Gansu, Sichuan, Qinghai, Kang, and Yunnan provinces, with a total population of more than 3 million people. However, these Tibetan areas cannot be included in the so-called Tibetan region, and there are no explicit provisions in the constitution for elections and voting rights in various provinces, so this proposal is made. Another case with a similar nature to this case is the proposal of Yang Zhizhong and other 20 people, suggesting that the indigenous peoples of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Kang, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces should be allocated National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members and supervisors in proportion to the population.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposals of Bai Yunti and others, the representatives of the provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia believe that the above provinces are currently treating Mongolian compatriots quite favorably, and it seems that there should be no other regulations. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Please Do Not Close the Door to Peace Talks!</h3>
<p>Since the National Assembly convened to draft a constitution, the people of our country have sincerely hoped that the Assembly can create a practical and feasible democratic constitution, laying a solid foundation for democracy and the rule of law in our country. However, they still eagerly hope that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can reopen peace talks, so that this special phenomenon of one side convening to draft a constitution while the other fights and sheds blood can end as soon as possible, and a genuine peaceful resolution can be achieved. Therefore, after the opening of the National Assembly, we, the common people, still hold a heart of urgent expectation for the reopening of peace talks, especially closely watching Special Envoy Marshall's trip to Beiping and Tianjin. Because Special Envoy Marshall has the determination to overcome all difficulties in mediating the Kuomintang-Communist issue, when the Communist representative Zhou Enlai left Beijing to return to Yan'an, he had concrete and specific suggestions to pass on to the Yan'an authorities to explore the possibility of reopening peace talks. Marshall, with great patience, waited for the CCP's reply, and only received Zhou Enlai's reply a few days ago. The content of the reply was very simple: the CCP put forward two preconditions for reopening peace talks: one was to dissolve the National Assembly, which was in session to draft a constitution, and the other was to restore the positions of both sides' troops when the ceasefire order was issued on January 13 of this year.</p>
<p>After receiving this reply, Marshall naturally felt that the possibility of reopening peace talks was slim. Even to us ordinary people, it is known that the CCP lacks sincerity in reopening peace talks, and the government has no room to accept the two conditions proposed by the CCP. Therefore, everyone felt extremely disappointed and believed that the CCP had decided to fight to the end militarily, seemingly unafraid of any sacrifice. This spirit of bravely fighting internally is indeed brave, but how can we, the common people, endure the performance of this great tragedy after twenty years of bloodshed! Fortunately, the government still adheres to its consistent position. On the 9th of this month, Chairman Chiang reported at the National Government Memorial Week, stating that in addition to expressing that the two conditions proposed by the CCP could not be accepted, he solemnly declared: "The government has never closed the door to peace talks and has consistently advocated a political solution to domestic problems, waiting for the CCP to participate in peace talks and reorganize the government at any time." These words are nothing less than the gospel of peace, rekindling a glimmer of hope for the prospects of reopening peace talks. The government sincerely hopes for peace and consistently advocates a political solution to domestic problems, which is indeed the most powerful guarantee for a peaceful resolution of national affairs. At the same time, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the government is currently considering a plan to send important officials to Yan'an to make a final effort for domestic peace; and the voices for Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, and Shao Lizi are the highest for the selection of important officials. If this plan is not opposed by the CCP and can be realized, it will be of great benefit to the reopening of peace talks and can be regarded as a turning point in the long-stalled peace talks. Therefore, the people of the whole country are looking up to Nanjing, eagerly hoping for the realization of this plan.</p>
<p>However, what is the CCP's attitude towards this plan? Initially, they remained silent and refused to comment. Only the day before yesterday late at night, they suddenly announced to the press the news that the National Army had begun to attack the Yan'an area, and emphasized that the six regiments of the National Army under General Hu Zongnan had penetrated thirty miles into the "Gansu-Shaanxi-Ningxia Border Region," calling this the largest offensive in the attack on the Yan'an area. The intention of the CCP spokesperson Wang Bingnan in releasing this shocking news is nothing more than to prevent us, the common people, from foolishly expecting the reopening of peace talks. Yesterday, Wang Bingnan spoke again, saying that the government's plan to send personnel to Yan'an was a kind of "peace offensive" adopted by the government. Yan'an can never express its agreement. According to this, although the government has opened the door to peace talks and is ready to reopen peace talks with the CCP at any time, the CCP has closed the door to peace talks again.</p>
<p>Therefore, we, the common people, must recognize the crux of the failure to reopen peace talks. The responsibility for this should be borne by the CCP, which is self-evident. What is valued in the third party is that it can transcend all partisan prejudices and adhere to its spirit of impartiality and selflessness, seeing clearly what is right and wrong, and distinguishing clearly between black and white. Therefore, in the current issue of responsibility for the failure to reopen peace talks, there is no room for ambiguity and there is a need for investigation.</p>
<p>Although we have no personal experience in party politics, we still have the insight to witness the political evolution of advanced democratic countries. We always feel that the Chinese Communist Party cannot be compared with ordinary political parties in advanced democratic countries. In advanced democratic countries, any party's competition is based on its domestic and foreign policies. We have never heard the CCP clearly announce its policies, and what it is arguing about is the issue of territory. We would like to say a few honest words to the CCP: Today, the people of the whole country are eager for peace and democracy. The task of the National Assembly is to formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution, and it has no other role. In addition to the Kuomintang, there are also social elites, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party present. This is the first step for our country to move towards democracy and the rule of law, and it is also an indispensable first step. The CCP's demand to dissolve the National Assembly is not only completely unreasonable, but also violates the public will of the people across the country who yearn for democracy. This is the first point. In order to realize domestic peace, the people have to earnestly request the reopening of peace talks day and night, but the territorial issues of any party are not what we, the common people, are concerned about. Using this as a condition for reopening peace talks, from our people's point of view, there is no sufficient reason. This is the second point. While the CCP is publicizing and claiming that the National Army has begun to attack the Yan'an area, on the other side, the Communist Army is launching offensives on various fronts. Not only is Yulin surrounded by the Communist Army, but Baoding has also become a besieged city. The Northeast Communist Army is also very active in the ice and snow. The so-called facts speak louder than words, and it is extremely difficult for the world to believe the CCP's propaganda offensive. This is the third point.</p>
<p>In short, things have come to this point, we are still foolishly hoping that both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can lay down their guns, stop fighting and bloodshed, and reopen peace talks so that domestic problems can be resolved politically. We, the common people, are really too eager for peace. Especially under the current circumstances, whether for the sake of the people or the country, internal strife cannot be allowed to recur. Therefore, we have to advocate peace first, without dwelling on the past, without talking about gains, as long as the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can reopen peace talks, we will never express despair and firmly believe that human conscience and common sense will prevail. May the leaders of both sides be determined to make a painful decision and make good use of their wisdom, especially the CCP, not to close the door to peace talks, and strive to turn conflicts into reconciliation for the country and the nation, leaving a glimmer of hope.</p>
<h3>Professors from Universities in Beiping and Tianjin Request Prompt Improvement of Treatment, Submitting Suggestions to the Chairman, Executive Yuan, and Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] Professors from Peking University and Tsinghua University believe that after enduring hardship in Kunming during the Anti-Japanese War, their lives must be stable after victory in order to contribute to academic and educational endeavors. Their current treatment is insufficient to maintain even the lowest living standards, let alone education and research. The professors from the two universities recently submitted a recommendation with over 150 signatures, and professors from Nankai University, upon hearing the news, have also come to Beiping to sign. The recommendation has been copied into three copies and submitted to the Ministry of Education, the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Chiang. The main points of their recommendations include: first, requesting a reasonable standard of living that meets the minimum living needs; second, ensuring fairness, as rice prices in Beiping and Tianjin are three times higher than in Nanjing and Shanghai, while treatment is one-third lower, and the income of state-owned production enterprises in Beiping and Tianjin far exceeds that of the education sector. Furthermore, presidents of national universities in Beiping and Tianjin also jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Education last month, requesting improvement of the treatment of teachers in the Beiping-Tianjin area.</p>
<h3>A Large Iron Ore Deposit Discovered in Liaoning Province</h3>
<p>Reserves Exceeding Those of Anshan and Benxi</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 10th] This newspaper reports today that iron ore deposits have recently been discovered in Tonghua and Huanren in Liaoning Province. The reserves exceed the total reserves of Anshan and Benxi, and the mining area is eight times larger than Anshan and Benxi. It is estimated that it can produce 400 million tons of iron, as well as tens of millions of tons of coal, which will occupy an important position in China's industry and national defense. The Anshan iron mine has been abandoned after being occupied by Soviet troops and destroyed by the Communist Army. Therefore, the discovery of the Tonghua and Huanren iron mines is even more important.</p>
<h3>Arson Case at Old Taoist Temple in Beiping Adjudicated by the Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 10th] The arson case at the White Cloud Temple in the western suburbs of this city was formally tried in the Grand Court of the Beiping District Court on the 10th. Thirty-five Taoists, including Xu Xinhe, were escorted from the detention center of the District Court at around 8:00 a.m. At 9:30 a.m., Judge Tang Bingjun and Clerk Zhang Ruoxu took the stand. The Grand Court was packed with onlookers. By 5:15 p.m., the debate concluded, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 14th of this month. All the defendants were returned to the detention center.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Reduces Shipment of Medical Supplies, CNRRA Sends Personnel to the United States to Negotiate, Requesting Allocation of Easier-to-Collect Items</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The UNRRA authorities previously stipulated that some items in the medical supplies shipped to China were not easy to collect, so they reduced the shipment of medical supplies to China by one-seventh. According to UNRRA's announcement, a total of 30,000 tons of medical supplies and equipment were shipped to China. As of the end of October, CNRRA had received about 5,000 tons in total. After the reduction, the actual amount will be more than 3,400 tons less than expected. Calculated in US dollars, the value of the originally allocated medical supplies was US$41 million, which will be reduced to US$34.7 million.</p>
<p>After obtaining this information, the Department will send Liu Ruiheng, chairman of the Department's China Medical and Health Business Committee, to Washington this week to contact the UNRRA authorities and request a delay in the reduction and will request the allocation of easier-to-collect items.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia reported to the UNRRA Council today that as of November 18, UNRRA had shipped 119,611 English tons of supplies to China, worth approximately US$211.8 million, accounting for 44% of the total amount to be shipped.</p>
<h3>Rioters from Huayuankou Bomb Two Excavators</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th] At midnight on the 9th, more than 600 armed rioters suddenly rushed into the Luwang Quarrying Site of the Huayuankou Dam Bureau, completely destroying two excavators and burning 50 to 60 tons of gasoline.

<h3>Traitor Ding Commits Many Evil Deeds</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Decides to Implement the Policy of Wealthy Counties Assisting Impoverished Counties, Earmarking a Percentage of Business Tax Revenue for Overall Planning</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 10th] The Zhejiang Provincial Government previously received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, hoping that in order to achieve balanced development of political affairs in various counties, a percentage of tax revenue from wealthier counties would be earmarked to assist impoverished counties. The 1481st meeting of the Provincial Government Committee decided that 30% or 20% of the business tax collected by each county and city should be earmarked to assist impoverished counties. Specifically, 30% will be earmarked from Hangzhou, Yin County, Shaoxing, Yongjia, Jiaxing, Hai Ning, Wu Xing, and other seven counties and cities with higher collection amounts, and 20% will be earmarked from Pinghu, Yuyao, Lanxi, Jiashan, Hang County, Jinhua, Huangyan, Ruian, Wenling, Pingyang, and other ten counties. The funds will be deposited in the provincial treasury on a monthly basis for overall planning. Telegrams have been sent to the relevant counties and cities to handle the matter.</p>

The current monthly revenue is only 300 to 400 million, which not only damages the national treasury but also affects the livelihoods of legitimate merchants and 240,000 related personnel. Shaoxing residents have repeatedly appealed, and it is now learned that Tax Bureau Chief Chen has been dispatched to Hangzhou to inspect and will go to Shaoxing, Ningbo, Jinhua, and other places to supervise taxation in the near future.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Hangzhou] The Hangzhou City Council, at the beginning of conscription in Hangzhou City in October, was aware that conscription in Hangzhou City was still the first time and was afraid of disturbing the people's hearts and affecting social order. It had a thorough discussion with the municipal government on the method of enlisting volunteer soldiers. Volunteers who joined the army would be given a resettlement allowance by the government, and the Bao chief would solicit 10,000 yuan from each conscriptable young man within the Bao to raise a "Bao Min Preferential Gold" of 1 million National Currency. However, it was feared that this decision would hinder national laws or cause malpractices during the solicitation process, so it was delayed. Recently, it has been learned that the municipal government has followed the military service laws under the "fair" and "just" principles and ordered each district to select two people from each Bao and report them to the municipal government for verification by the 15th of this month. The municipal government held a military service review committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 9th and decided to allow those on the publicly announced list of applications for exemption or postponement who meet the application standards but whose documents and procedures are unable to be legally prepared to apply for review early. Mayor Zhou said that the municipal government has selected the Shenmiao Temple on Fengqi Bridge, West Street, as the new recruit reception center.

Other parts are not guilty." After hearing the sentence, Li was initially miserable and silent, then gave a wry smile. After the sentence, he was ordered to be returned to detention. Then, Li Qinlu, who was related to Li's case, was brought in. Li bowed his head and said nothing, only admitting his guilt and swaying, seemingly extremely uneasy. The prosecutor read the indictment, and the defendant's defense lawyer made a favorable defense. President Zhou immediately pronounced the sentence: "Li Qinlu is sentenced to seven months of imprisonment." Li Qinlu was returned to detention. The case of the sensational thief Li Shengwu has come to an end.</p>

<h3>Huangyan Honey Tangerines Come on the Market in Season, Tangerine Orchards Stretch as Far as the Eye Can See, with an Annual Output of 60 Million Jin, The First to Be Transported and Sold to Shanghai Were the Tian Tai Shan Farmers</h3>
<p>— Taizhou News · Our Correspondent Shen Bo</p>
<p>Huangyan honey tangerines, the only special agricultural product of Taizhou, are now coming on the market in season. Because the honey tangerines produced in Huangyan have a sweet, fragrant taste, they are indeed a fine product among fruits, so they are famous far and wide. In order to understand the situation of the Huangyan tangerine industry, this reporter took the Jiangda steamer from Taizhou and arrived at Huangyan County. As the ship entered the Sanjiang Estuary, I saw golden tangerines hanging on the green tangerine trees on both banks, stretching for dozens of miles as far as the eye can see. This is a natural scenic tangerine orchard.</p>
<p>According to a Mr. Xu, a tangerine merchant, the first person to transport and sell Huangyan honey tangerines to Shanghai was the calligrapher Mr. Liu Wenjie (号 Tian Tai Shan Nong). At that time, because the honey tangerines were transported to Shanghai for the first time, they could not be sold for a while. In order to sell them, he came up with the idea of using the famous Mount Tian Tai as a tangerine name, calling it "Tian Tai Honey Tangerine". The tangerine trees are planted on the Hua 项 Mountain Peaks, etc. However, soon Huangyan honey tangerines gradually became popular at sea and sold very well, so even now, many tangerine merchants still use this "Tian Tai Honey Tangerine" as a well-known brand for sales.</p>
<p>The total area of tangerine tree planting in the county is about 13,000 mu, and there are more than 13,800 tangerine-growing households. The planted fields cover more than 50,000 mu, with more than 1.5 million tangerine trees planted. The annual output is more than 60 million jin, of which early tangerines account for more than 70% of the county's tangerine production, and vermilion tangerines account for 20% of the total production. Among the county's agricultural products, besides rice, the tangerine industry accounts for the largest share. The annual income is quite large, and the economy of Taizhou's rural areas is also revitalized. Although the region suffered from drought and typhoon disasters during the summer and autumn of this year, the tangerine production was not reduced. Now that the early tangerine market has opened, the price is more than 70,000 yuan per 100 jin, but because sales are weak, the price has gradually fallen to about 60,000 yuan.</p>
<p>There are more than ten varieties of tangerines planted. The six more productive varieties are briefly introduced below:</p>
<p>(1) Early tangerines, also known as honey tangerines on the market, have yellow skin, a fragrant smell, a larger size, and mature the earliest. They are harvested and eaten between September and October and are the earliest-developing variety of tangerines.</p>
<p>(2) Local early tangerines also have yellow skin, which is thicker than early tangerines. They have a very sweet taste and a lot of juice. They are the best variety of tangerines, and the "Tian Tai Honey Tangerines" sold in Shanghai are this fine fruit. They can also be stored for a long time without rotting and mature between November and December.</p>
<p>(3) Milk tangerines are the young ladies among tangerines. The fruits are smaller than early tangerines, with thin skin and luster. They have a clear, sweet taste, and the fruit skin has a special aroma.</p>
<p>(4) Vermilion tangerines have red skin, different shapes and sizes, and very rough skin. They are the rough product among tangerines. They taste very sour when first picked, so it is not advisable to eat them early. Only when other tangerines start to stiffen in the first month of the new year does the sour taste of vermilion tangerines turn sweet.</p>
<p>(5) 　　The fruit is larger than other tangerines, with thick and rough skin and a slightly bitter and sour taste. It is the latest-maturing variety of tangerines. Harvesting only begins in mid-to-late December, and when stored until February or March of the following year, its taste turns sweet and juicy.</p>
<p>(6) Baozi tangerines are the Washington navel oranges produced in the United States. They were imported from Japan in the early years of the Republic of China. They have few seeds, a lot of juice, and the sweetest taste. Their quality is better than local early tangerines. There are also Shantou seedless tangerines, mandarin oranges, yellow-skinned tangerines, Fujian tangerines, and kumquats, but the production is not large.</p>
<p>For planting methods, during the winter plowing each year, the soil is first piled up into mounds in the field, four to five feet in diameter and two to three feet high. Broken pottery pieces are buried at the bottom of the mounds to prevent the tangerine tree roots from extending deep into the soil. In the following spring, saplings are transplanted onto the mounds. After fertilization, irrigation, soil cultivation, pest control, and pruning, they can bear fruit. If the tangerine trees are to be healthy, the fruits that grow must be picked off early, before they mature, to prevent the dispersal of nutrients. Generally, it takes seven years before there is a return. During each winter season, it is best to pile up river bottom silt for cultivation. If the cultivation is appropriate, good fruit can still be produced for 60 to 70 years. However, fertilization must be based on the variety and age of the tree. Newly planted saplings should be given more frequent fertilization, with less fertilizer each time, twice a month. When the tangerine trees reach the fruiting stage, fertilization should be done two or three times a year.</p>
<p>Huangyan honey tangerines have a wide market. The major sales destinations are Shanghai, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nanjing, Wenzhou, Lishui, and various commercial ports along the Yangtze River. During the War of Resistance, due to transportation obstacles, the tangerine industry plummeted. Many tangerine farmers converted the planted tangerine fields into rice fields. After the victory of the War of Resistance last year, shipping between Shanghai and Taizhou resumed, and ships sailed regularly between the two places. As a result, tangerines could be sold smoothly to other places. As all goods rose in price, tangerine merchants and tangerine farmers all made several times their profits, grinning from ear to ear. The packaging for export has also been gradually improved. In order to avoid being crushed and rotten during transport, the bamboo baskets have now been replaced with boxes. As a result, the consumption of Huangyan wood materials has also increased.</p>

<h3>Lu Xingyuan Criticizes Improper Housing Tax in this City</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Because the National Government promulgated the revised Housing Tax Regulations on the 4th of this month, Article 1 stipulates that the collection of housing tax by each city and county shall be in accordance with the provisions of this regulation. The latter part of Article 2 stipulates that no additional taxes shall be levied under any other name besides housing tax. Article 4 stipulates the housing tax rate as follows: 1. For rented business premises, the rate shall not exceed 10% of the annual rent; for owner-occupied business premises, the rate shall not exceed 12‰ of the current value of the premises. For rented residential premises, the rate shall not exceed 5% of the annual rent; for owner-occupied residential premises, the rate shall not exceed 5‰ of the current value of the premises, etc. (Omissions). Upon investigation, the housing tax currently levied by the Municipal Finance Bureau is calculated based on the rent from 1937, divided into three categories A, B, and C, multiplied by 2,000 to 1,000 times respectively. A total of 20% is added for military tax, and another 20% is added for municipal construction tax, totaling 40%, which is a harsh tax unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign. Citizens have listed reasons and sent letters to the North China Daily News and the Continental Daily News, etc., strongly objecting. Some believe that the current municipal administration is worse than during the enemy-puppet period, some believe that collecting harsh taxes is no different from violent robbery, some believe that collecting harsh taxes is fraudulent, and some believe that collecting harsh taxes is no different from sucking the people's blood. The public is indignant, expressing public opinion and advocating immediate improvement, which is commonly seen by readers. Now that the National Government has clearly stipulated the tax rate, the Shanghai Municipal Government should immediately comply. For uncollected housing tax, the amount should not exceed the limit stipulated in the Housing Tax Regulations. Therefore, the payment forms for housing tax and municipal construction tax should be uniformly canceled by the Finance Bureau. I hereby request that your newspaper publish this letter in the Reader's Column so that the public may know it. Sincerely, (Lawyer Lu Xingyuan)</p>
<h3>The Constitution Endows Citizens with Health</h3>
<p>Editor: The National Assembly representatives Hu Ding'an, Zhu Qi, Wu Zhimei, Hu Xuanming, Guo Zuyuan, Wang Ziji, Chen Jixian, Yang Dopu, etc. proposed to add a special article on promoting national health to the basic national policy of the Constitution. Its content is quite commendable. As far as I know, the wording of the article is "The state shall actively promote public health and improve national health." The reason is "We believe that the health of the people is the foundation of national strength. Since the European War, most countries in the world have included the protection of people's health in their constitutions. Articles 120 and 122 of the Soviet Constitution are the most obvious examples. After the outbreak of World War II, countries such as the United States, Britain, and France further recognized health as the wealth of life. The health of the people is the resource of the state. Therefore, the Atlantic Charter clearly stipulates freedom from want. And the Health Act announced by Britain in March of this year and the New Declaration of Human Rights in France have all been designated as special chapters of the Constitution. Even the recent Constitution of Japan stipulates that the people have the right to live a minimum standard of living that is healthy and cultural. The health of the people in our country is not up to the standards of several countries. At the beginning of nation-building, if we do not determine the national policy of promoting national health, then no matter how perfect the politics are, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of economic construction due to the lack of human strength. To protect the health of the people, we must vigorously implement public health in order to achieve the purpose of protecting the health of the people," etc. It is worthy of attention. I hope to publish it in the newspapers to advocate it together. (Reader Leng Xiaoyuan)</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A on Raw Silk Loans</h3>
<p>Reply to Zhang Naihong: Regarding the various points raised in your letter about government-sponsored raw silk loans, the United Management Office of Spring Silk Loans in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has replied: "(1) The original letter stated that "the issuance of loans to small silk factories is particularly delayed, even up to 20 days or more, so that the silk loans are still under review, and the factory has experienced strikes due to unpaid wages." Upon investigation, this office is an institution jointly established by the bank and the China Silk Corporation. All loans have separate regulations. According to the regulations for this year's spring silk cocoon loans, each manufacturer should transport the raw silk to Shanghai and store it in a warehouse, obtain a formal warehouse receipt, and submit it to the Commodity Inspection Bureau for qualification. After obtaining the inspection certificate, they can apply to this office for silk cocoon loans. The handling of warehousing, inspection, and other procedures takes considerable time and is not a special delay in the issuance of loans to small silk factories. The responsibility for unpaid wages and strikes lies with the factory owner and is a separate matter from the loan and cannot be confused. (2) The original letter stated that "large factories or those with close connections to the company can receive payment based on the 'transport company's' bill of lading, regardless of whether the silk has been reeled well." Upon investigation, this office, in view of the time-consuming nature of the aforementioned regulations, has consulted with the Central Bank and temporarily allowed the waiver of the inspection certificate, instead relying on the warehouse receipt and inspection report to approve the loan. Furthermore, the transport of raw silk to Shanghai often involves delays due to the difficulty in finding warehouses. To meet the urgent needs of manufacturers, the manufacturers are allowed to have the bill of lading stamped by this office and stored in a warehouse on their behalf, and loan procedures are processed simultaneously. All of these repeated improvements are to streamline procedures and facilitate manufacturers. Regardless of the size of the silk factory, the procedures are handled uniformly, without any favoritism. (3) The original letter stated that "The reorganization of the Shenxi Gongcheng Transportation Co., Ltd. was forced by the fact that the goods could not be delivered in time." Upon investigation, the Shenxi Gongcheng Transportation Company has not had any instances in the past where the goods could not be delivered in time. Its internal reorganization is not related to the loan. The corresponding explanation is hereby given for your information." Specially delivered.</p>
<h3>Student Parents Protest Assigned Donations</h3>
<p>It has been reported that on October 29, Nanjing Electricity wrote, Chairman Jiang telegraphed to fellow countrymen across the country to conserve manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Regarding donating to build schools, paper should be freely donated, and absolutely no amount should be stipulated, which is close to assigning. Today, the country is not yet peaceful, and fellow countrymen are in deep pain. All levels of government personnel and fellow countrymen across the country should deeply understand this kind of keen instruction and stop them all. Unexpectedly, the seven children of this humble person are studying at a certain middle school and a certain elementary school (three middle schools and four elementary schools). The amount is still stipulated, with 60,000 yuan for each person, and 30,000 to 20,000 yuan, totaling 280,000 yuan, ordering children to raise donations separately. Not only are there clear orders from the distant words, but also giving immature children a bad influence. This is not the case for this humble person alone. All student parents in our province are like this. Relatives and friends tell each other that they are all heartbroken, and they all say that this is far from the purpose of parents educating their children. Children are ignorant and are forced to donate everywhere because of the school's threat. All relatives are public servants who are deeply distressed, and they are often glared at by others. They don't know a word and cry bitterly when they go home. This kind of strange phenomenon is actually done by someone who dares to do it without scruples. What is his heart! It is really confusing. The people of the country have always been good at profiting from opportunities. I didn't expect that the authorities of a few schools in Fuzhou could collect money with such skill that they could rival the so-called school shops. It's magical and amazing! This humble person has served in the customs for twenty-two years, abiding by the law, being honest and self-disciplined. In the July 7th Incident, I was working at the Sandu Customs, and I felt that the national crisis was imminent. I voluntarily donated and contributed all the five liang of goldware stored in my home to the Central Finance Committee of Nanjing through Mr. Chen 　英, chairman of the Fujian Provincial Party Department and chairman of the Anti-Enemy Relief Association (the event was published in the Fuzhou Fujian Minbao Lin Sitao donated a large amount of gold and silverware). I hope that victory will come, but after a year, the treatment of public servants is meager, and it is difficult to support the seven sons and two daughters. Education is even more costly. I use the strength of borrowing from the future to cultivate children and make them useful talents in society. As a result, it has come to this! My heart is hurt when I see it with my own eyes, so I hereby send a letter on behalf of student parents in the province. I hope that the school will stop students from raising donations immediately, and those who are unable to raise donations should not be discriminated against, so as to preserve the vitality of the country, educate the future, and benefit the future of the country immensely.

<h3>Forthcoming Meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers Scheduled for Next Spring in Soviet Capital; Molotov Puts Forward Concrete Proposals on German Issue</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in New York, 10th] The four major powers' foreign ministers have recently agreed that the next foreign ministers' conference will be held in Moscow starting March 10th next year, to draft the German peace treaty, and to allow news reporters from various countries to freely report on the conference proceedings. According to reports, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov requested last week that the next foreign ministers' conference be held in Moscow. During the talks held last night by the four powers, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes expressed his agreement with this proposal, but first asked whether Mr. Molotov would permit news reporters to freely report on the conference proceedings. Mr. Molotov replied that he was willing to follow the precedents of the two previous foreign ministers' conferences in Paris and New York and grant the press the same convenience. However, Mr. Molotov intends to reserve his response until Tuesday regarding Mr. Byrnes' plans to reduce the Allied occupation forces in Europe and to immediately convene a foreign ministers' conference to study the German issue.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, New York, 9th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, acceding to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's request, held talks with him today for an hour. According to political observers, Mr. Molotov is expected to present several concrete proposals aimed at achieving an early conclusion to the German peace treaty. Meanwhile, official announcements confirm that the four foreign ministers have decided to hold the next meeting in Moscow on March 10th next year. Tonight's meeting of the four foreign ministers discussed the agenda for the upcoming Moscow meeting, including a proposal to appoint representatives to prepare for the Moscow meeting. Mr. Molotov opposed this proposal, requesting time to consider it, but agreed that the four foreign ministers should instruct their representatives to review the drafts proposed by the United States, France, and the Soviet Union regarding the agenda. French Foreign Minister Bidault seized this opportunity to state France's views on certain points. Mr. Bidault stated that France hoped the German border issue would be discussed first, but ultimately agreed to consider the report of the Allied Control Council for Berlin first. Mr. Bidault also proposed changing the wording in the U.S. proposal discussing the "future provisional and permanent government of Germany" to "Germany's provisional political institutions under the control of the four powers," to which Mr. Byrnes agreed. A decision was then made to discuss the issue of the foreign ministers' representatives' preparatory meeting. Mr. Molotov expressed his opposition, arguing that before the four powers determine Germany's borders, if the foreign ministers' meeting were to hear the territorial claims against Germany from several European countries, it might provoke a strong reaction from Germany. Mr. Bidault concluded by explaining France's views on the Saar issue, but it was not discussed at the meeting. The four foreign ministers will meet again tomorrow, at which time Mr. Molotov is expected to make a final decision on the foreign ministers' representatives' meeting.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Paris, 9th] Semi-official sources report that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simić has asked France to inform the foreign ministers' conference that Yugoslavia wishes to participate in the upcoming foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German and Austrian issues, as Yugoslavia is a country with a direct interest in the German and Austrian peace treaties. In a letter to French representative Bidault on December 4th, Mr. Simić strongly emphasized Yugoslavia's concern for the economic and territorial provisions of the German and Austrian peace treaties.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, New York, 9th] France's draft agenda for the next foreign ministers' conference was submitted to the secretariat yesterday. The United Kingdom has not yet formally submitted a draft agenda, presumably because it believes that the drafts already submitted by the Soviet Union, France, and the United States are sufficient for discussing the formal agenda. The points in the draft proposed by France are as follows: (1) Future borders of Germany; (2) Measures to control European security (based on the U.S. draft previously submitted for the four powers to supervise Germany's disarmament); (3) France's proposals regarding the Ruhr and Rhineland regions; (4) The Allied Control Council's reports on disarmament, repatriation, elimination of Nazism, reparations, and economic unification, central institutions, and provisional political organizations; (5) The outline of permanent German political institutions; (6) The purge of Prussia; (7) The report of the coal experts committee (decided at the foreign ministers' conference in Paris this summer); (8) The outline of the German peace treaty; (9) The outline of the Austrian peace treaty and related matters; (10) Restrictions on occupation forces within Europe.</p>
<h3>UN Political Committee Eliminates Disputes, Drafts Universal Disarmament Proposal; Indian Proposal Passes, Including Three Points; Disarmament Control Agency Independent from Security Council</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the United Press, Lake Success, 9th] The disarmament proposal review committee of the UN Political Committee today eliminated disputes over the disarmament issue, effectively completing the preliminary drafting of a universal disarmament plan. This is a victory for France, Egypt, and India. These countries promoted the inclusion of a clause in the disarmament plan stipulating that troop withdrawals from foreign countries by the relevant countries should be considered when discussing disarmament steps, and that the issue of a UN guard force should be considered. The dispute was resolved due to the following two reasons: (1) General Assembly President Spaak, impatient with the continued debate, asked the delegates to stop wasting time on irrelevant issues. (2) British representative Shawcross asked the delegates to consider the newspaper criticism of the meeting and urged the delegates not to become a laughingstock. Initially, the debate over the French and Egyptian proposals was inconclusive. Finally, it was merged into the Indian proposal, and at the suggestion of the Brazilian representative, it was divided into three parts for a vote, which passed. The first part stated that the General Assembly, recognizing the close relationship between the security issue and the disarmament issue, proposed that the Security Council strive to expand the application of international guards as stipulated in Article 48 of the Charter. The second part proposed that governments implement gradual and balanced withdrawals of their troops stationed in non-enemy territories. The third part suggested that motorcades stationed within member states' territories should be withdrawn as soon as possible. This clause was proposed by Egypt, and the United States advocated for its amendment, stipulating that troops stationed abroad according to existing treaties should be an exception, which was passed by a vote.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 9th] The UN General Assembly's disarmament subcommittee resolved tonight that the agency responsible for supervising international disarmament should operate independently from the Security Council. Although Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky refused to clarify whether the veto power would not be applied to this agency, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had previously indicated that the veto power only applies within the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Political Committee Rejects Motion to Sever Relations with Spain; Amendment Calls for Recall of Ambassadors to Spain</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the United Press, Lake Success, 9th] The UN Political Committee today passed Belgium's proposal on the Spanish issue with 27 votes to 7, with 16 abstentions. The proposal recommends that all member states immediately recall their ambassadors and ministers from Spain under Franco's leadership, with embassy affairs to be managed by chargés d'affaires. If a democratic government has not been established in Spain within a reasonable period, the Security Council should consider further appropriate measures. This proposal is less drastic than the one proposed by the subcommittee, which advocated that member states individually sever relations with Franco, but was rejected a few minutes earlier by a vote of 20 to 20. A proposal submitted by China to prohibit the United Nations from purchasing grain from Spain was also rejected.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Marseille, 10th] A demonstration was held here last night demanding Spanish independence and non-interference from foreign countries. Demonstrations will be held throughout the country today, and shops in the planned demonstration areas will be closed to prevent unforeseen circumstances. This morning, all newspapers featured news of last night's demonstration on their front pages, claiming that 700,000 people participated, severely protesting the UN's attitude. However, neutral observers believe that the number of participants was exaggerated.</p>

<h3>Stalin Retreats Behind the Scenes, Soviet Policy Undergoing Transformation; Recent Concessions to Britain and the United States, Whether Expedient Measure Remains Uncertain</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the United Press, New York, 9th] The Soviet Union's policy towards the United States and Britain has recently become more moderate. Western diplomats believe there are four reasons for this, the main one being the preparation for Soviet leader Stalin's less active role in governance. Whether Stalin is old and infirm and unable to cope is a matter of speculation, but it is well known to diplomats here that Stalin has retreated behind the scenes in recent months, with Molotov and other key figures in charge of everything. Therefore, it can be concluded that even if Stalin is not ill, he has already become a prophet and philosopher of Soviet communism, rather than a hands-on leader. The power center in Moscow is shifting. In other words, if external problems of the Soviet Union can be easily resolved, then its internal problems will also be easier to handle. From the perspective of British and American diplomats, the Soviet Union's recent softening of its stance at the UN and the four-nation foreign ministers' conference is the main driving force. In addition, there are three other reasons: (1) The Soviet Union is deeply concerned about the United States possessing the atomic bomb, and its most important diplomatic goal is to find ways to prohibit its use and subject it to international control. (2) Domestic construction has a direct impact on a large portion of the Soviet people and is always of greatest concern to the Soviet authorities. On the one hand, it needs to obtain more reparations from Germany, and on the other hand, it needs to obtain U.S. financial and technical assistance, which requires a more friendly international relationship. (3) The political failures of communist parties in Europe and other countries have caused the Soviet authorities to feel a significant degree of disappointment. For example, in the elections in Eastern European countries, although the communists had Allied military police as their backing, they still failed to secure a victory. Even in France, they did not achieve complete victory. In addition to the above reasons, the firmness of U.S. foreign policy seems to have had a considerable impact. However, whether the Soviet Union's recent concessions represent a genuine change in its policy, enabling it to permanently work together with Western countries, or are merely a temporary expedient to overcome domestic difficulties, remains to be answered.</p>
<h3>Standardization of Armaments, Britain and the United States Have Exchanged Views</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 9th] Lord President of the Council Morrison said in Parliament in response to a question from Labour Party member Piratin that there had been no formal decision regarding the standardization of British and American armaments, but that weapons had been exchanged within a large scope during the war. There is still this cooperation between British and American occupying forces in Germany today. Therefore, for the sake of economy and efficiency, informal exchanges of views on the issue of weapons standardization have inevitably taken place.</p>
<h3>French National Assembly Holds Third Round of Prime Ministerial Elections</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] The French Fourth Republic Senate is holding re-elections, which have not yet been completed. The Assembly is scheduled to hold a third round of voting tomorrow to elect a Prime Minister. Observers here today are trying to estimate the final distribution of seats in the Senate. The Senate will have a total of 315 members, 214 of whom were elected yesterday (including 200 from mainland France and 14 from French Algeria), with 101 more members to be elected.</p>
<h3>Combination of Chinese and Western Music, Appreciated by Parisians</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) held a concert last night to entertain the delegates to the UNESCO conference. The program included a piece composed by the head of the delegation, Zhao Yuanren, sung by Miss Ge. The melody blended traditional Chinese music with Western music in a unique and interesting way, and the audience was full of praise.</p>
<h3>Iranian Elections Imminent; Central Army Enters Azerbaijan Province, Occupies Many Towns Without Resistance</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Agency] London, 10th Broadcast: Iranian government troops are currently advancing along the southern border of Azerbaijan Province, having entered the province and advancing towards the provincial capital, Tabriz. Government troops have destroyed border defenses and occupied twelve towns.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Sri Lanka, 10th] A spokesman for the Iranian General Staff said that government troops entered Azerbaijan Province yesterday without encountering any resistance. Some democratic soldiers in Azerbaijan Province surrendered after a brief battle. Government troops entered from Qazvin and advanced 50 miles into Azerbaijan Province to Mianeh, which has already captured Faraj Quch, a city strongly defended by democratic soldiers. Meanwhile, Idris Sultana informed Javid, the Governor of Azerbaijan Province, that government troops entered Azerbaijan Province to supervise the holding of general elections and hoped to follow government orders, facilitate the implementation of government tasks, and maintain security and good order.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, New York, 9th] The UN Economic and Financial Committee held the last meeting of the current General Assembly today, passing a compromise proposal on relief matters after the termination of UNRRA, and finally resolving the international issues with many disputes. According to the recommendation of La Guardia, the outgoing Director-General of UNRRA, a special technical committee will be established to organize a new agency to replace the International Emergency Food Fund Committee. The Special Technical Committee will consist of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Poland, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. The chairman of the Economic and Financial Subcommittee later decided that the amount of contributions from member states would not be specified, but rather only urged each member state to assist in completing relief matters when and where relief is needed next year. Some representatives in today's committee stated that this method cannot reflect the international principles guiding UNRRA's various activities, nor can it achieve complete international cooperation. However, given the United States' refusal to support international relief agencies after the termination of UNRRA, this may be the only practical compromise.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Agency] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: The 48 member states of UNRRA expect that the agency's Director-General, La Guardia, will soon submit his resignation, but still advocate continuing UNRRA-style relief, and recommend establishing a $400 million emergency food relief fund.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Washington, 10th] Authoritative sources say that UNRRA is scheduled to hold its sixth, and final, board meeting here today. Director-General La Guardia is expected to announce his resignation at that time.</p>
<h3>Lewis Case to be Retried</h3>
<p>Supreme Court to Open Next Month</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the United Press, Washington, 9th] The Supreme Court today approved the government's request for an expedited judgment on the coal miners' strike case and agreed to decide the issue of whether foremen can organize unions, which is of great importance to John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers of America. Although the strike has ended and most workers have returned to work, the Supreme Court still allowed the government to appeal and legally resolve whether the injunction issued by Federal District Judge Goldsborough was lawful. The case is now scheduled for argument on the 14th of next month and can be ruled on any Monday thereafter, approximately before the April 1st deadline, as Lewis indicated when he ordered 400,000 miners to return to work last Saturday that a possible strike might resume on or after April 1st. As for the issue of foremen organizing unions, it was a major obstacle in Lewis's negotiations with private mine owners for a new contract. The mine owners decided not to make concessions until the Supreme Court ruled.</p>
<h3>Smuts Arrives in London Today, Emphasizes Relations Between India and the Soviet Union; Indian Assembly Applauds the U.S. Constitution; British House of Commons to Discuss the Indian Issue</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, London, 9th] South African Prime Minister General Smuts arrived here by plane this afternoon from New York. He declined to comment on the world situation, only saying: "I will stay here for two or three days and then depart for South Africa." According to informed sources, General Smuts will hold talks with British Foreign Office officials. The main topic of discussion will likely be the issue that the Indian delegation in the UN General Assembly and the Soviet Union, Byelorussia, Ukraine, Yugoslavia and other countries have maintained a close "joint" relationship. According to diplomatic observers, the Slavic group and the Indian representatives always take the same position whenever the issue of the South African Federation is raised, especially when accusing South Africa of racial discrimination, indicating that there is a close joint relationship. Therefore, diplomatic circles here attach great importance to this matter and the South African Federation's request to merge with Southwest Africa, especially given General Smuts' visit to Britain. In addition, informed sources told this agency's reporter that at a time when the British-Indian negotiations in London have failed, making the situation in India more delicate, the "joint policy" adopted by the Soviet Union and India is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Washington, 9th - United Press] British Foreign Secretary Bevin, accompanied by British Ambassador to the United States Inverchapel, called on President Truman today and met with the new U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Gedney. Regarding the Palestine issue, Truman reiterated his support for the partition plan.</p>

According to informed sources, the date for the House of Commons to discuss the Indian issue may be the 12th of this month.</p>

<h3>Fifth Anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Incident; World Situation Still Unstable; Atomic Bomb and Biological Warfare Threaten Peace; People Still Not Relieved from Fear of War</h3>
<p>— Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department from an Original United Press Article by Miller</p>
<p>On this day of eternal remembrance, the fifth anniversary of Pearl Harbor, war remains the greatest fear in the world. For many people, peace is still that old cliché, flickering like a will-o'-the-wisp.</p>
<p>We fought in Europe for more than nineteen months. The war in the Pacific lasted for sixteen months.</p>
<p>But the lingering trends of calamity are now greater than anything humanity has ever seen, because the Second World War produced two weapons: the atomic bomb and biological warfare. According to scientists, they can destroy human civilization.</p>
<p>New Terror</p>
<p>A new terror and the atomic bomb were brought to Earth together on August 6th and 8th, 1945, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But it wasn't until several months after the war ended that the world began to realize the extent to which another new terror, biological warfare, had developed.</p>
<p>If this type of warfare were to be completed and applied, the size of the death zones would be measured in continents. With other weapons, including atomic bombs, the destructiveness is only regional. The fear and suspicion that were budding among the nations united in the desperate war against Germany and Japan took root and fueled the development of these new weapons.</p>
<p>At the same time, although the major war has passed, small wars are still going on. In many parts of the world, the peace that came on May 8th and August 14th, 1945, seems very unpleasant, simply not peace at all.</p>
<p>Since the end of the great war, there has been no peace in Palestine and China.</p>
<p>The blood flowing in the mountains along the Greek border is as red as that shed on any battlefield in World War II.</p>
<p>Guerrilla fighters who died in the jungles of Luzon after the peace are just as dead as the Filipinos who died on Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor.</p>
<p>Another War</p>
<p>Even in countries where blood is no longer being shed, peace seems to be just another kind of war. We have witnessed strikes in the United States, unfree elections in small European countries, and famine and misery in Italy and Denmark.</p>
<p>The countries that launched the war have all been defeated. Japan, which launched a shocking attack on Pearl Harbor in the United States on December 8th, 1941, and caused the war to begin.</p>
<p>Her bombs and torpedoes nearly wiped out the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which made it possible for Malaya and Singapore, the Philippine Islands and Indonesia, and the Southwest Pacific Islands to be recaptured without resistance.</p>
<p>Japan was finally defeated three years, eight months, and seven days after the Pearl Harbor incident. Her fleet was sunk, and major cities were destroyed. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were devastated by a kind of violence that had never been seen in the universe since the beginning of time.</p>
<p>Hopeless for Peace</p>
<p>Germany's surrender was three months earlier than Japan's. Following the war against Germany, the only real hope for peace to this day has been created — the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>But the hope in the hearts of most people is now less bright than it was in the summer of 1945, when the United Nations was just born in San Francisco. The Allied military occupation has only had no major problems in Japan.</p>
<p>During the Second World War - the establishment of a peaceful work - the politicians dedicated to it - seemed too daunting.</p>
<p>Since its birth, the United Nations has - experienced all the congenital - of babies, - and has also suffered all - the difficulties.</p>
<p>The almost non-stop arguments between Eastern and Western allies seem poised to doom the United Nations to an early death when the time is right. Deep-rooted disputes between large and small countries have also plagued it. Sullied by greed, terror, and hatred, the United Nations often looks like it is dying.</p>
<p>Are these just the normal illnesses of a young child? Will the United Nations finally grow into a glorious youth, and let us see it reach adulthood? This human effort is still in progress. Politicians say they believe they can make the United Nations do things.</p>
<p>On the other side of this, we also have the stumbling blocks created by biological warfare and the atomic bomb. (Translated by Shan Fengyu)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Request Reduction in Reparations; U.S. to Adopt a More Lenient Attitude; Japanese Reparations Agency Being Established</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 9th] Regarding the future level of Japanese industry, sources here have stated that the United States will allow Japan to maintain a higher level of industry, slightly exceeding that stipulated by U.S. Reparations Commissioner Pauley. [United Press, Tokyo, 10th] Japan appears to be conducting an organized campaign to reduce reparations. It has been learned today that the Japanese government will request a reduction in the Pauley reparations plan, arguing that the plan would bankrupt Japanese industry.</p>
<p>[Reuter's News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] To implement reparations, the Japanese government established a Reparations Council last year. Recently, a Reparations Countermeasures Department was established within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a Reparations Department was established within the Rapid Termination of the War Affairs Bureau to serve as a liaison with the Allied forces. Additionally, a Reparations Implementation Cooperation Council was established within the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to serve as an administrative body for reparations. In June, essential guidelines for the handling of reparations factories to be dismantled were determined, and a Reparations Dismantling Law was drafted, which is expected to be submitted to the current Diet session. Local reparations councils will also be established in various local agencies to oversee the dismantling work. It is reported that the production equipment for reparations, totaling 12 million tons, will require 170 million cubic feet of timber, dismantling costs will amount to 3.5 million to 4 million yen, and the process will take one year.</p>
<h3>Commercial Air Route to be Opened Between the United States and India</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the United New Company, Washington, 9th] Transcontinental &amp; Western Air (TWA) of the United States is scheduled to open a commercial air route between the United States, Palestine, and India in January of next year. The flight from Washington to Bombay will cover 9,000 miles and is expected to take 42 hours and 40 minutes, with stops in New York, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Karachi, and other locations. The total ground time is estimated to be 10 hours.</p>
<h3>Artificial Snow Experiment Successful</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The China Natural Science Society reports: The recent successful artificial snow experiment conducted by American scientist Schaefer at the Schenectady airport is a major victory in humanity's conquest of nature. Schaefer, at the General Electric Company's scientific research laboratory, discovered that snowflakes formed when microscopic particles of dry ice were added to supercooled, moist air. Based on this theory, Schaefer recently conducted a large-scale artificial cloud experiment at the Schenectady airport. He ascended into the clouds by plane and dispersed six pounds of microscopic dry ice particles into the sky. Shortly thereafter, snowfall was observed in the clouds. The latent heat from the condensation caused turbulence in the cloud layer, ultimately leading to snowfall. According to Schaefer, only one microscopic particle of dry ice is needed to produce several tons of snow after falling 2,000 feet.</p>
<h3>China and India (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— By Nehru</p>
<p>Translated by Zhou Xiangguang, Our Correspondent in India</p>
<p>China and India have become increasingly connected and developed close relationships due to the spread of Buddhism. Whether this initial connection between China and India occurred as early as the reign of Emperor Ashoka is unknown. It was only when items such as silk were frequently transported from China that maritime transportation developed. However, in the earliest periods, there must have been people traveling and land transportation routes, as the people along the eastern border of India resemble the Mongol race. This is even more evident in Nepal, and is also commonly seen in the provinces of Assam and Bengal. History tells us that Ashoka's missionary work was widely promoted, and as Buddhism spread in China, travelers and scholars traveled between China and India for over a thousand years. They traveled by land, crossing the Gobi Desert and the mountains and plains of Central Asia, and crossing the Himalayas—a long and difficult adventure. It is unknown how many Chinese and Indian travelers braved this route. According to some, 90% faced dangers along the way. Many people, upon reaching their destination, did not want to return and settled there. But there was another route, though less safe, which was shorter. This was by sea, through Vietnam, Java, Sumatra, Malaya, and the Nicobar Islands. This was a commonly used sea route, but sometimes travelers would come by land and return by sea. Buddhism and Indian culture spread throughout Central Asia and parts of Indonesia, where many monasteries and academic research institutions existed. Thus, travelers from India or China traveling by land or sea had places to stay and rest upon reaching their destination. Sometimes, scholars coming to India from China would first study Sanskrit for some time in the Indian colonies of Indonesia before arriving in India.</p>
<p>The earliest recorded instance of Indian scholars arriving in China is that of Kāśyapa Mātanga, who arrived in China during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty, perhaps at the invitation of Emperor Ming. Kāśyapa Mātanga established himself in Luoyang, accompanied by the Indian scholar Dharmarakṣa. Later Indian scholars who came to China included Kumārajīva and Bodhidharma. Each of them had several monks and disciples. It is said that in the sixth century AD, there were three thousand Indian Buddhist monks and over ten thousand Indians residing in Luoyang.</p>
<p>These Indian scholars not only brought many Sanskrit scriptures to China and translated them into Chinese, but also wrote scriptures in Chinese. Their work greatly contributed to Chinese literature, including poetry. Kumārajīva arrived in China in 401 AD. He was a prolific writer and left us forty-seven types of scriptures. He translated the works of the great Indian philosopher Nāgārjuna into Chinese. Later, Jñānagupta went to China in the mid-sixth century AD. He translated thirty-seven original Sanskrit scriptures into Chinese. His great knowledge was so revered that the emperor of the Tang Dynasty in China became his disciple.</p>
<p>There were both land and sea routes between China and India, and several Chinese scholars went to India. Among the most famous, and whose travelogues survive to this day, are Faxian, Xuanzang, and Yijing. The monk Faxian came to India in the fifth century AD, and he was a disciple of Kumārajīva. When Faxian left his teacher for India, his teacher told him something very interesting. Kumārajīva told Faxian that when he arrived in India, he should not only spend all his time on religious knowledge, but also study the lives and customs of the Indian people, so that China could understand the whole situation of India. After arriving in India, the monk Faxian studied at Pāṭaliputra University.</p>
<p>Among the Chinese scholars who went to India to study Buddhism, the most famous was the monk Xuanzang. He came to China in the seventh century AD, during the height of the Tang Dynasty in China and the reign of King Harsha in North India. Xuanzang traveled by land, passing through the Gobi Desert, Turpan, Kucha, crossing the Pamir Mountains, crossing the Himalayas to India. Xuanzang told us about his adventures along the way, and about seeing many Buddhist rulers and monasteries in Central Asia, as well as the worship of Buddhist monks by the Turks. Xuanzang traveled all over India, and in every place he went, he was worshipped and respected by the local people. He carefully examined the local people and local conditions, and recorded everything he heard. He lived at Nālandā University for many years. (Translator's Note—According to Huang Chenghua's History of Chinese Buddhism, he stayed for five years). Nālandā was also not far from Bodh Gaya. At Nālandā University, he was able to conduct many kinds of academic research and get along with students from far and wide. It is said that there were about 10,000 monks living permanently at Nālandā University at that time. Xuanzang obtained a degree in law from this university and later became the vice-chancellor of the university.</p>
<p>Xuanzang's book, Records of the Western Regions, is a book that one never tires of reading. He came from a country with a high level of culture, at a time when Chang'an in China was the center of art and literature, so his articles describing the situation in India are of great value. He told us about the educational system and progress of Nālandā University after its establishment, and listed five courses for students: (1) Grammar, (2) Crafts, (3) Medicine, (4) Logic (today輯), (5) Philosophy; he was also admired by most Indian students. Some elementary education was very developed, and monks and teachers became teachers. Regarding the people, he said: "Although the character of ordinary people is frivolous, they are upright and loyal. They are extremely honest in matters of money. They also consider the fairness of their actions; their behavior is not fraudulent or dishonest, and what they say or promise is truthful. The laws established by their government are very fair, and their behavior is very gentle and kind. Crimes and thefts are very few; however, sometimes they do occur." He further said: "The government's administrative facilities are built on the principles of benevolence, and the things done are very simple, and the people do not belong to power. Therefore, in this regard, the taxes levied on the people by the government are very light. Merchants are busy with business affairs."</p>
<p>Xuanzang returned to his country along the same route through Central Asia, carrying a large number of scriptures. From his recorded books, it is recorded that Buddhism had great influence in Khurasan, Iraq, and Mosul, and even to the borders of Syria. At this time, Buddhism gradually declined in those places and in the Islamic world; but at the same time it had spread to Arabia, and soon spread throughout this land. Regarding the people of Iran, Xuanzang made an interesting observation: "They do not pay attention to the way of learning, but they can completely devote themselves to art work. They often profit from neighboring states."</p>
<p>Iran's past and future have been devoted to the beautification and expansion of life, and this situation has influenced the rest of Asia. Turpan is a small, unfamiliar kingdom on the edge of the Gobi Desert. Xuanzang told us about it, and in recent years, thanks to the efforts of archaeologists, we have gained a lot of knowledge. The culture here is a hybrid culture formed from the inspiration of Chinese, Indian, Persian, and Greek literature and art. Its language is one of the Indo-European languages, taken from India, Iran, and some similar European Celtic languages; religion was also transmitted from India, its way of life belongs to China; and some works of art were transmitted from Iran. The murals and sculptures of the Buddha and the male and female gods are beautifully made, and the statues often have Indian robes and Greek headdresses. According to Groset, "These goddesses are a happy crystallization representing the gentleness of Hinduism, the emotions of the Greeks, and the charm of Chinese women." After Xuanzang returned to his motherland, he was welcomed by the Tang emperor and the people, and decided to devote himself to writing and translating the scriptures he brought back from India. When Xuanzang began his journey from China many years ago, a story was passed down that the Tang emperor held a handful of mud powder in a cup and gave it to Xuanzang, saying: "You must drink it well, because I have told you that a handful of soil in your homeland is worth more than ten thousand taels of gold in a foreign country."</p>
<p>Xuanzang's visit to India was highly respected by the people of both China and India, and further established the political relationship between the rulers of China and India. At that time, King Harsha of Kanyakubja in North India and the Tang Emperor of China sent envoys to each other. Xuanzang himself remained in India, exchanging letters with his friends or collecting scriptures. There are two very interesting letters, originally written in Sanskrit, preserved in China. One of them was from the Indian Buddhist scholar Prajñadeva to the Dharma Master Xuanzang in 654 AD. After inquiring about the news of his friends and their literary work, he went on to say: "We are now sending you a piece of white cloth, expressing that we have not forgotten you. The road back is long, and we hope you do not mind this small gift and that you can accept it. Regarding the Sūtras and Śāstras collections, we believe that you will also need them, please give us a catalog, and we are willing to copy one for you to use." Xuanzang said in his reply: "I recently heard from the envoys returning from India that the great teacher Śīlabhadra has passed away. The news made me so sad that I could not carry on. As for the books in the two scripture collections, I have brought them all back, and have already translated the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra and other thirty volumes of scriptures into Chinese. However, I must now tell you that when I passed through the Kōu Dú River, I lost a large number of sacred scriptures. I have attached a catalog of these scriptures. I ask you, if you have the opportunity, please give me a copy. I offer some short articles as gifts, and I hope you will accept them."</p>

<h3>Trial Opens for the Zang Da Er Zi Case; Three Rickshaw Pullers Testify to the Events; Next Hearing to Confront the Murderer; Deceased's Brother Demands 140 Million in Compensation; Instigator Lai Ling Nai Returned to Custody After Questioning</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of rickshaw puller Zang Da Er Zi (Zang Yaocheng) being fatally injured by American soldier Roderick, instigated by Spanish sailor Lai Ling Nai, was prosecuted by the District Procuratorate after being reported by the deceased's brother, Zang Haicheng, according to law. The American soldier Roderick, who committed the assault, is being handled by the US military authorities according to law. The case opened in the Criminal Division of the District Court yesterday afternoon, with Lai Ling Nai being questioned, who denied the charges vehemently. Witnesses Chen Xuedong, Ren Xiaozhu, Mao Guifu, Liao Yuanshou, and the plaintiff Qi Haicheng were questioned. The answers of the witnesses differed quite a bit under individual questioning. There were several American soldiers in the audience. The court adjourned for another hearing. The murdering American soldier will be summoned to court next time for confrontation.</p>
<p>Lai Ling Nai looked old, with gray hair and a damaged right heel, wearing a dark blue woolen coat, a yellow khaki shirt underneath, yellow khaki pants, and black leather shoes, holding a grass-green canvas cap. He answered questions in Spanish, which were translated into English and then into Mandarin. He stated: He is 57 years old, Spanish. He is a sailor on the American merchant ship Morris. He first arrived in Shanghai on August 27th and stayed on the ship. On September 22nd, at around 4:30 PM, he went to the Seamen's Club and went out alone at around 10:00 PM, taking a rickshaw to the Huadu Dance Hall, paying the rickshaw puller one US dollar, and then went inside. He drank two or three bottles of beer, each costing US$1.25. After waiting for a while, he wanted to return to the ship. After going out, he was surrounded and pulled by many rickshaw pullers, including the rickshaw puller who brought him. He did not argue with him, only that he wanted to pull him. When he went out, an American soldier in blue uniform came out, whom he had not seen while drinking, and did not know the name of the American soldier. As for why the American soldier hit the rickshaw puller, it was because the rickshaw pullers were fighting to pull and tug, and the American soldier was also drunk at the time. By the time the rickshaw puller fell to the ground, he had already left three or four steps away. The court asked, "When you argued with the rickshaw puller, you called to the American sailor, 'Friend, come and help me.' Did you say this in the prosecutor's office?" Lai replied, "I would not say that."</p>

<h3>Four Witnesses Questioned; Liao Yuanshou First to Describe the Incident</h3>
<p>Immediately after, the questioning of witnesses began. Liao Yuanshou was questioned first. Liao stated: He works as a tricycle driver and does not know Zang Da Er Zi. On the evening of September 22nd, at 9:00 PM, he was waiting for business at the entrance of the Anle Palace Huadu Dance Hall. Zang Da Er Zi was already there when he arrived. At 9:30 PM, Zang told everyone that a foreigner with a bad eye took a rickshaw here and went inside without paying. He asked everyone to take care of it when he came out. When the Spanish man came out, he was seen by another tricycle driver, Zhao Adi, who called out to Zang Da Er Zi. Zang followed to ask for money. The old man (referring to Lai Ling Nai) pretended to be drunk, swaying back and forth, and refused to pay. The two pulled and tugged, walking east. At this time, an American sailor came by tricycle and got off in front of the Anle Palace, but did not go inside. The old man called "Friend." I knew it was a friend. The two talked for a few sentences, which I did not understand. At that time, the old man and Zang Da Er Zi were still pushing and pulling. The old man punched Zang. When Zang got close to the American soldier, the American soldier raised both hands and punched Zang in the right temple area, and Zang fell to the ground. After the incident, the two perpetrators walked east, but were surrounded and stopped by passers-by. Later, a car came with four or five American soldiers on it. The two perpetrators got into the car, but Chen Xuedong grabbed the steering wheel and refused to let it drive away. Later, MP and SP cars arrived. The old man got into the MP car, and the American soldier got into the SP car and went to the police station.</p>
<h3>American Soldier Punches, Falls to the Ground</h3>
<p>Dong Xuedong stated: He works as a rickshaw puller and is a cousin of Zang Da Er Zi. He arrived at Anle Palace at 8:00 PM on the afternoon of September 22nd, waiting for business, and left only when the fight occurred. Zang pulled the Spanish man here at 10 o'clock, but he did not go upstairs to pay the fare immediately. More than ten minutes later, the Spanish man and an American sailor came down shoulder to shoulder. Zang followed to ask for the fare. The Spanish man did not pay. The American sailor let go, the Spanish man fell, and the American sailor punched Zang in the chest. Zang fell to the ground and fainted. Later, two jeeps came, and the American soldier was taken back to the American military headquarters, while the Spanish man was taken to the police station in another car. I saw the Spanish man come to hit.</p>
<h3>Ren Xiaozhu's Testimony</h3>
<p>Ren Xiaozhu stated: He works as a tricycle driver. On the night of September 22nd, he arrived at the entrance of Anle Palace at about 10:00 PM. Around 10:30 PM, Zang pulled a rickshaw over, and the old man in the rickshaw did not pay the fare. More than ten minutes later, the old man and an American soldier came out together. Zang went forward to ask for the fare. The old man ignored him. They pushed and pulled each other. Later, the old man said a few words to the American soldier. The American soldier wanted to pull Zang Da Er Zi away. Zang refused to leave. The American soldier punched Zang in the chest. Zang fell to the ground and fainted. The two then went east.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Mao Guifu Speaks</h3>
<p>Mao Guifu stated: He is police officer number 5912 of the Huangpu Branch. On the day of the incident, he was the first police officer to arrive at the scene. When he arrived, Zang had already been helped up and was leaning against the wall. He immediately notified the bureau by phone to send a car. Later, two American military jeeps came. The Chinese military police on them told us to go to the police station together, but one of the cars carrying the American soldier did not go, only the car carrying the Spanish man went to the bureau.</p>

<h3>Re-questioning Liao Yuanshou on Qingdao Incident</h3>
<p>The court then questioned Liao Yuanshou about being invited by the American military to go to Qingdao. Liao stated: He was invited by a Chinese man surnamed Zhu to inquire about the details of the incident on the fourth floor, room 409, number 2 Beijing Road, and asked if he could go to Qingdao. After he agreed, he was taken to the American Consulate to get a passport and quarantine certificate. At 9:00 AM on October 16th, he took an American military plane to Qingdao from Jiangwan Airport. In the days after arriving, he was taken to military ships several times to be questioned. The American soldier who committed the assault was on one of the ships. During this time, he was asked if he could help the American military speak. He replied that he would say what he saw and do what was convenient. Until 12:00 PM on October 19th, he took an American military plane back to Shanghai. Others thought he had taken money from the American military, but he had not taken any money. When he went to Qingdao, he promised to compensate him for 20,000 yuan per day for the loss, but after returning to Shanghai, he went to claim it several times, but it was delayed and not paid, so he did not want it.</p>
<h3>Incidental Civil Suit; Demanding Compensation</h3>
<p>Zang Haicheng, the deceased's brother, stated: He is 38 years old and is a cleaner. Zang Da Er Zi is my elder brother. There are only two brothers. The deceased only left behind a daughter named Genbao, who is 14 years old. He also filed an incidental civil suit demanding compensation for losses. Zang's lawyer, Chen Zhen, stood up and read the contents of the petition, requesting the defendant Lai Ling Nai to compensate for (1) funeral expenses of 8.704 million yuan; (2) loss of the victim's income, based on the deceased's daily income of 20,000 yuan, calculated from the actual age of 42 to the age of 60, totaling 131.4 million yuan; (3) consolation money for the bereaved family of 5 million yuan. The total of the three items is 145.104 million yuan. It was stated that if the American soldier Rott, who committed the crime, were to pay compensation in the future, Lai Ling Nai could be allowed to pay a reduced amount proportionally. The court instructed that the American soldier perpetrator would be sentenced by the American military, but a civil claim for compensation could be attached to the American military through diplomatic channels. The lawyer replied that he had submitted a document to the Ministry of Justice requesting it to handle it. At this point in the trial, the court ordered that the case be adjourned for another hearing, and the American soldier would be summoned to court for confrontation next time. Lai Ling Nai then declared to the court that the charges were unfounded and requested bail, which the court did not grant, and ordered him to be returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Professor Roper Receives Reporters to Discuss the Tasks of the British Council</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Professor Roper, the British Council's representative in China, and his wife arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday to take charge of the preparatory work for the Shanghai branch. He specially received reporters at the Cathay Hotel at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon to report on the tasks of the Council and the progress of the preparations.</p>
<p>Professor Roper stated: The Council has been established for ten years. In 1942, Dr. Joseph Needham, a famous scientist from Cambridge University, and others visited China to prepare for the establishment of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office, which has close cooperation with various schools in the mainland and provides great assistance. The British Council's office in China has its headquarters in Nanjing, establishing contact with various schools and cultural institutions in Nanjing, and establishing a reference book library there. At the same time, a branch is set up at No. 27 Bund, Shanghai. Its main task is to distribute British books, magazines and other materials to universities and educational institutions throughout China. The Council also plans to establish a branch in Peiping soon and hold a library branch in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The Council also provides various scholarships for Chinese university graduates and professors to study in the UK, but due to the current lack of places in the UK, it has to be slightly restricted, admitting 20 university graduates each year, who are selected by a selection committee jointly organized by the Chinese Ministry of Education, the Sino-British Educational and Cultural Fund Committee and the Academia Sinica. There are quotas for various subjects. At the same time, it will select the same number of Chinese government scholars, and the British Industrial Association will provide them with opportunities to go to the UK to inspect factories and industries. In addition, the Council will also send a small number of university professors to the UK to study British education, life, society, books, administration and local administration. In addition, the sculpture exhibition held by the Council will be open to the public at the Great New Company starting next week.</p>
<h3>Fu Wen's Reception for the Press Reports on the Whole Story of the Disaster Caused by Military Supplies, With Over 28,000 Artillery Shells Lost, and the Exact Cause of the Fire Still Unknown</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the First Branch of the Second Ordnance Depot of the Jiangwan First Supply District of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, where the explosion occurred on the afternoon of the 7th of this month, after days of efforts by firefighters to reduce the heat with Shanghai water, the explosions have completely stopped since yesterday during the day. Fu Wen, Commander of the First Supply District, will lead his subordinates to the scene of the accident at 9:00 AM this morning to continue excavation and cleanup, and will invite reporters from various newspapers to visit together.</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM yesterday, Commander Fu, in order to clarify the details of this disaster and the handling process to all sectors, specially held a detailed report at the headquarters for the press in this city. The following is a record of his entire speech: (1) Overview of the warehouse: Its name is the First Branch of the Second Ordnance Depot of the First Supply District of the Logistics Command. The location is the oval-shaped track and field at the Jiangwan Stadium (now called the Sports Ground). (2) Time of the fire: 1:15 PM on the 7th of this month. (3) Location of the fire: Warehouse No. 7 next to the west commanding platform of the track and field.</p>
<p>Measures Taken After the Fire</p>
<p>(4) Measures Taken After the Fire: After receiving a report from warehouse chief Chuan Jimin at 1:20 PM, the following measures were immediately taken: 1. Telephoned Chief of Staff Tan of the Garrison Command to dispatch a fire brigade for rescue. 2. Dispatched a company of soldiers to the fire site for security. 3. Instructed the head of the Ordnance Department, Mao Shenghua, to take emergency measures immediately. 4. Notified all other warehouses and the Transportation Brigade under its jurisdiction to implement martial law. 5. Notified Commander Wu Shi Xuan by telephone. 6. From 2:00 PM onwards, he went to the scene of the accident to work with the local police station to find ways to rescue. 7. After inspecting the scene of the accident for an hour, he returned to the headquarters and reported to Commander-in-Chief Huang of the Joint Logistics Headquarters by telephone. 8. Telegraphically instructed the head of the Ordnance Department to detain Wang Renlan, the head of the First Branch, but Wang had disappeared in the chaos, and Wu Rubiao, the warehouse officer in charge, had also fled. Wang's wife, Ye Suhua, and Wu's wife, Zhao Shengtang, were detained. Wang's wife had just arrived in Shanghai on the 6th of this month. Warehouse chief Chuan Jimin was still at the scene to rescue. 9. From that afternoon to midnight, he visited the accident site four times. Due to the violent explosions, the fire brigade was unable to force its way to put out the fire. At that time, he also telegraphed the Garrison Command to request the US Air Force to send planes to drop fire extinguishing bombs, but it happened to be Saturday afternoon, and the US military was on holiday, so it could not be realized. (5) Range of the fire: From the southern end of the west commanding platform to the gate of the east commanding platform, exactly half of the entire warehouse.</p>
<p>The Reason is Still Unknown</p>
<p>(6) Cause of the Fire: After consulting with relevant parties on the afternoon of the 8th, warehouse chiefs, warehouse soldiers, transport soldiers, and four officers and soldiers from the First Sub-station of the Zhejiang Supply Bureau were summoned (according to the sub-station, more than 10,000 hand grenades were sent, with one officer and four soldiers escorting them, one of whom had already died). Also interrogated the wives of the escaped branch chief and warehouse officer, and villagers. According to the injured transport soldiers Luo Debiao, Chen Chunji, and Yuan Mingcai, the escort soldier of the Zhejiang Supply Bureau, who were the last to leave the warehouse, after they had handed over all the ammunition and retreated, the receiving warehouse worker Rao Xingwang and the escort sergeant platoon leader Zhu Weizhang were still inside, sorting things out all day. They had just boarded the truck a few steps away from the warehouse door when they heard continuous explosions. From this, it is speculated that the hand grenades exploded due to improper handover. However, the exact cause is still pending further investigation in conjunction with the Garrison Command, the Garrison Headquarters, and the Logistics Headquarters.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Number of Losses</p>
<p>(7) Number of Losses: All were ammunition received from the enemy and puppet regime, of which the usable parts included 10,730 hand grenades, 6,310 75mm mountain artillery shells, 19 Japanese Type 10 illumination bombs, 83 flare bombs, 109 signal flares, 9,043 Japanese Type 89 heavy grenade discharger rounds, 83 one-kilogram smoke canisters, 96 Type 94 smoke tubes, 103 Japanese Type 10 detonators, 43 Japanese Type 1 ignition tubes, 78 meters of slow-burning fuse, and 645 fire extinguishing bombs. The scrap parts included 8,721 82mm mortar shells, 11,490 75mm mountain artillery shells, 3,896 French-style 77mm blank cartridges, 45 tons of miscellaneous rifle and machine gun bullets (approximately 28,000 bullets per ton), 1,099 miscellaneous artillery shells, 18 empty boxes of 30-second fuses, 11 small anti-electric appliance replenishment boxes, 33 150mm grenade heads, 580 Japanese Type 92 77mm bullet plates, and 1,500 safety plug covers. Also, one three-ton six-wheeled truck (number 02757).</p>
<p>In total, there were 28,515 usable and scrap mortar shells and mountain artillery shells.</p>
<p>Re-examination This Morning</p>
<p>Investigation Process: From 4:00 PM on the 8th, military and police organs and subordinates were gathered to summon officers and soldiers of the branch warehouse and injured escort soldiers for separate individual interrogations, which ended at 11:00 PM late at night. All stated that the explosion started in the warehouse, and hand grenades exploded continuously in an instant, causing the fire. On the 9th, an inspection was made at the scene of the accident, and the wreckage of a truck was found next to the west commanding platform, with two charred bodies beside the truck and inside the warehouse. It is now scheduled to conduct a thorough investigation again on the morning of the 11th. In addition, on the morning of the 8th, personnel were sent to the Army Hospital to investigate, and three artillery soldiers and four transport soldiers from the 146th Brigade were found to be injured. As for the civilian houses near the warehouse, there was no damage except for shattered glass windows.</p>
<p>Rushing to Handle the Aftermath</p>
<p>(9) Aftermath Measures: 1. Sent warehouse chief Fu Jimin to supervise and lead officers and soldiers to clean up the remaining bullets and debris at the bombed site and tidy up other nearby warehouses. 2. Requested the fire brigade to extinguish the remaining fire. 3. Detained the wives of the escaped branch chief and warehouse officer and investigated the introducers and guarantors. It was found that these two people have shady backgrounds, so it is believed that they fled in fear of punishment and will not have other functions. 4. Warehouse chief Chuan Jimin was released on bail, with Deputy Director of the Ordnance Department Deng Guangze as the guarantor. 5. Appointed Mao Qifang as the acting branch chief. 6. The loss list was urgently drawn up overnight, and drawings were made and reported to Chief of Staff Chen of the Ministry of National Defense and Commander-in-Chief Huang of the Joint Logistics Headquarters for the record. 7. Sent soldiers to repair doors and windows in various places. 8. Continued to send officers and soldiers to investigate the damage to nearby civilian houses. 9. Continued to investigate the cause of the accident.</p>
<h3>Responsible Personnel, Submitted for Punishment</h3>
<p>(10) Responsibility: From the responsible warehouse officer, branch chief, general warehouse chief, up to the responsible section chief, director, and himself, all should be subject to joint punishment, and will be submitted to superiors for disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Finally, Commander Fu also expressed his feelings, saying that this city has no military storage facilities. The track and field was originally a storage warehouse for the Japanese. After the victory, a large number of munitions from various places were received. The warehouses were not enough. Although a request was submitted to build more than 20,000 tons of warehouses, it could not be realized due to excessive costs. We had to accommodate as much as possible in the existing warehouses. Everything was not ideal, and there were not enough talents and transportation vehicles, resulting in this disaster. I am extremely sorry for disturbing all the people of Shanghai. Fortunately, with the assistance of all sectors, it was calmed down in a short period of time, and I am especially grateful.</p>
<h3>A Pair of Little Wealth Gods Extorted 50 Million, The Case Cracked at Hongqiao Road, The Hostage Found in Danyang County, Seven Male and Female Bandits Arrested Successively</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Detective Section of the Police Bureau cracked a kidnapping case yesterday, arresting seven male and female bandits one after another. The two hostages were safely rescued in Hanlin Town, Danyang. Wang Youfu, a Dongtai native who runs a brothers' store at 902 Changning Road in this city, lives at 36 Kangfu Lane on the same road. On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, his son Rongxin (9 years old) and the son of his neighbor Lu Tong (now a salesman at Ronghua Xiang Hardware Store, 182 Daming Road) Weiguo (9 years old) disappeared while playing in the alley. Later, it was reported to the Jiangning Road Police Station and a missing person notice was published, but their whereabouts were unknown. On the 5th of this month, a letter was received from the post office, stating: Your sons are currently safe and sound. If you can prepare 50 million yuan to buy 20 gold bars as a ransom, they will be sent back; otherwise, they will be killed. The letter also stated that whether you agree or not should be indicated by your store's large discount flag. If the flag is still there the next day, it will be considered a refusal; otherwise, it must be taken down.</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, Wang and others knew that their sons had fallen into the hands of bandits, so they secretly reported to the Jiangning Road Police Station and the Detective Section of the General Bureau, requesting an investigation. They immediately followed the bandit's letter and took down the large discount flag. Waiting until the 9th, they received another letter, agreeing that his wife alone, wearing a red handkerchief, should take a rickshaw to the cow shed near the Hongqiao Road Airport to hand over the money between 12:00 noon and 3:00 PM that day. At this time, the Detective Section of the Police Bureau had also received a tip-off. Section Chief Deng Youli led Section Chief Ren Gongqin, clerks Chen Jinsheng, clerk Chen Xingrong, sergeants Xu Shutian, Ye Kui, etc. disguised themselves and waited in the wheat field near the cow shed until 2:30 PM. Wang's wife arrived by rickshaw. After the rickshaw left, a man resembling a farmer came and whispered to Wang's wife. At that time, Wang's wife claimed: Because I am short on funds, I can only raise five gold bars today. The bandit immediately ordered her to throw the gold bars into the cow shed and said that the remaining amount would be discussed at the entrance of Kangfu Lane at 6:00 PM in the afternoon. The police officers jumped out of the field upon witnessing everything and captured the bandit. At the same time, another accomplice was arrested in the balance field 200 yards from the cow shed. After strict interrogation, they confessed that their names were Wang Bingsheng, 25 years old, from Jiading, and Liu Chunlin, 25 years old, from Danyang. There were also two accomplices on the lookout, who were still in a nearby small teahouse. Wang Shougen (38 years old, from Jintai) and Liang Amao (33 years old, from Danyang) were immediately arrested and brought to the bureau together. After interrogation, the five criminals, Liu, confessed to the kidnapping and extortion. As for the two hostages, they were taken to Suzhou on the night of the kidnapping on the 1st and stayed there for two nights, then taken to Hanlin Town, Danyang. They are currently hidden in Liu Chunlin's house, guarded by his sister Liu Lianying. As for the motive for the kidnapping, it was due to gambling debts that could not be repaid. Therefore, Liu's wife, Yuan Gendi (a maid at 33 Kangfu Lane), and Yin Yongfu, who shared information at 39 Kangfu Lane, provided information. However, Wang Shougen and Liang Amao claimed that they came to Shanghai due to unemployment and asked Wang Liu to find them a job. Only today were they instructed to wait in the teahouse and report if they saw the police. After the police bureau obtained the confessions, in addition to continuing to arrest Yin Yongfu and Yuan Gendi at their addresses, they sent personnel by night train to Liu Chunlin's house in Hanlin Town, more than 20 miles from the city, on the 9th to retrieve the hostages and arrest the guard Liu Lianying. They all returned to Shanghai at 5:30 PM last night. In addition to notifying their families to claim the hostages, all the bandits are still under further investigation.</p>
<h3>At the Gate of the High Procuratorate, People Scramble to See Female Movie Stars, Chen Yan and Li Lihua Report in Full Dress, After Interrogation, They Were Released on Bail Pending Trial, Zhang Shankun and Other Ten People Still Did Not Appear in Court Yesterday, Zheng Ping and Hong Liezheng Were Busy Running Around for Their Husbands</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court Procuratorate interrogated the third batch of thirteen shadow play personnel suspected of being attached to the enemy yesterday, but only Chen Yanyan, Li Lihua, and Zhou Shimu reported. Prosecutor Qu Rong opened the court for interrogation and ordered them to be released on bail pending trial.</p>
<p>At 8:40 AM yesterday, Zhou Shimu was the first to report with a summons. Zhou is a photographer for "China Film" and currently works for Cathay Pictures Company, claiming that he felt quite sudden about being summoned this time. At 9:32 AM, Chen Yanyan arrived in a No. 1735 1941 Studebaker Champion car with two empty seats. She got out of the car in front of the Shanghai Prison and went to the High Procuratorate to report with a summons. Chen was wearing a black呢cloak, long red絨linen gloves, and black mid-筒leather shoes. After reporting, she sat in the bailiff's office. Before long, the horn sounded, and a No. 14535 1946 light gray Ford car drove into the Shanghai Prison Plaza. The first person to get out of the car was Li Lihua, accompanied by her husband Zhang Xupu and others. Li was wearing a玄fox fur coat, gray flannel trousers, and green 鷄skin shoes. After reporting, she sat opposite Chen Yanyan and talked quietly. The bailiffs' office suddenly became lively, and there were quite a few people who came to "admire the demeanor of the movie stars." At 9:45 AM, Prosecutor Qu Rong took the stand and Li Hua entered. At 10:26 AM, Zhou Shimu was also summoned to court for questioning. They each stated the process of participating in "China Film." They left the court at 10:38 AM, and Prosecutor Qu immediately ordered each to be released on bail pending trial. He ordered bailiff Wang Junhua to accompany Chen Yanyan, Cai Yunlong to accompany Li Lihua, and Shan Yiquan to accompany Zhou Shimu to check the bail separately. When Chen and Li were leaving, Zheng Ping, the wife of Mei Xi, hurriedly arrived to state the reason why Mei Xi could not attend court. Bian Hongliezheng, the wife of Bian Yuying, had already submitted a statement a day earlier claiming that Bian was abroad and was now on the way to Hong Kong, and claiming that Bian was currently suffering from heart disease and could not rush to the hearing. Others who were summoned but did not arrive included Zhang Shankun, Chen Yunshang, Zhang Shichuan, He Furan, Hu Junkang, Zhong Baoxuan, Jin Longzhang, Wu Shenchu, and others.</p>
<h3>Chen Yanyan Gave a Bitter Smile, Claiming That She Was Outdated in Filmmaking</h3>
<p>According to Li Lihua yesterday, she went to Qingdao after the victory. The summons from the High Procuratorate was sent to her home in Baokang Lane, Xiafei Road. My mother sent a telegram to inform me, and I came to Shanghai on the 6th of this month to respond to the summons. Chen Yanyan said that she had returned to her old home in Beiping for a trip and recently came to Shanghai. She was a little confused about being summoned this time. Since Chen had not participated in the filming of the two puppet films "Regret of the Spring River" and "Eternal Remembrance," the group of reporters asked whether being summoned this time was related to Zhang Shankun? Chen replied: Maybe a little, but I was not asked about this today. When asked if she planned to make films again, she smiled bitterly and said: "I am outdated, now they are advancing!" Her words seemed to be full of sadness.</p>

<h3>Assessing the Wages of the Hotel Industry, The Meeting Will Investigate Business Accounts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Labor-management disputes have recently occurred in the hotel industry, and the Social Affairs Bureau is working to assess them. Yesterday, the assessment committee and both labor and management parties each sent three people to form three teams of three to go to various hotels to investigate business accounts. Yesterday, the industry trade union also hosted reporters to report that the association aims to strive for a reasonable and legal salary system, eliminate tips, reduce the extra burden on passengers, and improve the character of waiters. The capitalists have been externally promoting that business is sluggish, income has sharply decreased, and a flexible salary expansion system and wage reduction are not enough to maintain the existence of the hotel industry, which is actually deceptive. In fact, the hotel industry is better than other businesses.</p>
<h3>Director Wu Talks About Year-End Bonuses, Not Necessarily the Same for Each Company, All Depends on Profit and Loss</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian said: At the meeting held at the Municipal Government on the 9th, it was decided that the year-end bonus should be limited to one month's salary increase, and it does not have to be the same for each company, all depending on the profit and loss situation. This decision will soon be submitted to the Municipal Government meeting for approval, and then announced by the Mayor for compliance. This resolution applies to all state-owned enterprises in this city. When asked how to determine the profit and loss situation of each factory, he replied: In principle, it is reported by the capitalists, but if the workers have different opinions, the Social Affairs Bureau will investigate and decide. Wu believes that the yarn factories are currently more prosperous, but when calculating their profits, the depreciation of machinery and equipment should be taken into account, and small yarn factories should also take into account the economic situation. Regarding the issue of labor discipline, Wu evaded answering, but agreed with the opinion of improving labor efficiency.</p>

<h3>President of the Executive Yuan Convenes Various Institutions and Organizations to Discuss the Development of Production Enterprises, Deeply Hoping for Assistance and Collaboration from Relevant Government Agencies and Industry and Commerce Leaders to Resolve Difficulties in the Shortest Possible Time</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to assist the development of production enterprises and promote economic recovery, President Song convened a meeting at the Bank of China Building at 11:00 AM yesterday, inviting the chairmen and executive directors of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association, heads of national banks and bureaus, and responsible officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to discuss the matter. Those who attended included Bei Songsun, Wu Guozhen, Xu Boguo, Huo Yamin, Li Fusun, Xu Jiguan, Qin Runqing, Luo Qinghua, Lin Fengbao, Li Shuming, Xu Zixiang, Li Daonan, Huan Yanglun, Li Yunliang, Shou Jingwei, Xu Weiming, Liu Gongyun, and over twenty others. The meeting lasted for two hours.</p>
<p>Establish a Production Loan Review Committee to Actively Provide Loans Based on Needs</p>
<p>President Song delivered a speech, stating in brief: The government has always been extremely concerned about production enterprises. The consolidation of foreign exchange in August and the recent revision of the Provisional Regulations on Import and Export Trade are all aimed at reviving production enterprises and accelerating national construction. However, after eight years of long-term resistance against Japan, our country has suffered severe destruction and devastation by the enemy and puppet regimes, and it is not easy to restore the social and economic order to a normal state in a short time. In addition, the general psychology, after the victory, is overly optimistic, which easily leads to disappointment. Communist troops are again destroying production and transportation facilities everywhere, causing the national economy to fall into a state of chaos and instability. Therefore, although the government has given various assistance to the production sector in terms of administrative measures, all industries still feel that it is difficult to operate and difficult to sustain. The government has repeatedly discussed remedies for this, hoping to make overall arrangements and seek the revival of enterprises. What can be announced to you first are the following: First, for the lending of funds to normal production enterprises, the method has been approved and the national financial institutions and commercial firms, etc. are urged to actively provide loans according to the actual needs of each industry. A Provisional Review Committee for Production Enterprise Loans has been specially established by the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks to be responsible for handling it. The committee members have been invited to be responsible personnel from relevant agencies, chambers of commerce, and banking industries. In order to gather wisdom and deal fairly. Second, the interest rate on this production enterprise loan should be reduced to a reasonable limit, and the Central Bank will adjust it by means of transfer and collateral. Third, procedures and mortgage guarantee methods, etc., must be simplified as much as possible to meet the needs of various industries. Fourth, the machinery, raw materials, etc. needed for legitimate production enterprises should be given priority supply by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Materials Exchange Supply Bureau, and other material management agencies as much as possible. Fifth, issues such as transportation, equipment, transportation costs, the handling of labor disputes, and the revision of tax systems and tax rates that are conducive to the professional development of assisting production are also being studied separately to improve methods. The overall goal is to resolve the difficulties felt by production enterprises in the shortest possible time and to actively seek development. This depends on the concerted efforts of all levels of competent authorities, relevant social organizations, and industrial and commercial leaders to help each other and achieve success on a daily basis, which is not something that the financial sector can accomplish alone.</p>
<p>Pooling Efforts to Achieve Practical Results</p>
<p>There is something that cannot be left unsaid. The prosperity of a country's economy and the progress of production enterprises depend not only on whether the national policy is sound, but also on whether the competent authorities at all levels and the competent business agencies can support the government's policies and implement them unremittingly. This is a key factor. Whether it can be fully utilized and achieve practical results is not only a matter of whether the competent authorities can work hard to promote it. All relevant social organizations, production enterprises themselves, and even every member of society must be able to cooperate with the government's policies, appreciate the difficult environment, pool their efforts, and prioritize the interests of the country and society over their own gains and losses. This is even more important.</p>
<p>Striving to Promote Three Expectations</p>
<p>I will strive to supervise and promote the maintenance and development of production enterprises in the future. However, I hope that you will pay special attention to the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) National banks and commercial firms should strive to be quick, convenient, and active in assisting the lending of funds to legitimate production enterprises, but they should automatically and effectively restrict loans that are not urgent or illegitimate.</p>
<p>(2) Production enterprises themselves should actively improve management, improve technology, increase efficiency, and reduce costs in order to seek self-reliance in survival and development, and should not rely solely on loans and material assistance.</p>
<p>(3) Economic and administrative authorities should effectively supervise the businesses under their jurisdiction, improve operations, and jointly seek promotion. Those who operate improperly or violate national policies should be strictly corrected immediately. The improvement of economic undertakings involves a wide range of issues. Post-war construction is undoubtedly difficult. The Democratic Party in the United States and Churchill in England were not spared the criticism of the people because of their great achievements. Even in Soviet Russia, prices have risen a lot since the armistice. China's economy has always been backward, and the impact of the war has been the longest, so the recovery work is also the most difficult. It is hoped that leaders from all walks of life will provide opinions at any time. If it is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, it will always be adopted and implemented at any time.</p>
<p>Various Sectors Express Opinions</p>
<p>Subsequently, Xu Ji, Li Fusun, Qin Runqing, Luo Qinghua, Jin Runxiang, and others spoke successively. The following is a summary of the opinions of each member: First, the most difficult problem currently faced by the industrial and commercial sectors is the high cost of wages. Because wages are issued according to the cost of living index, and the base salary has been increased several times, it excessively increases production costs and has a fatal impact on the industry. It is proposed that the government seek a reasonable solution to the handling of labor disputes and wages as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Second, the interest rate on black market loans is currently high, and commercial firms, in addition to paying the universal deposit reserve to the Central Bank, must also maintain a considerable deposit of exchange bank guarantee reserve. The Central Bank should allow for flexible use and domestic allocation, which can gradually suppress high interest rates.</p>
<p>Third, it is hoped that the scope of collateral for production enterprise loans will be expanded to allow the use of machinery as collateral without age restrictions.</p>
<p>Fourth, the import management method is well-intentioned and beautiful, and all sectors unanimously support it. However, please provide convenience for the prompt withdrawal of various imported goods that are in transit and have arrived at the port in order to save costs. As for how the government purchases and subsidizes various export goods or provides differential awards and preferential treatment, please also seek appropriate policies from the government as soon as possible.</p>
<p>President Song instructed separately on the above items, saying in brief: In addition to the approved methods, the opinions of Gu Ren will be submitted to the competent authorities for separate study and implementation.</p>

<h3>Illegal New Shacks in Restricted Areas to Be Demolished Starting Today Director of Public Works to Inspect Areas with Police and Artisans and Persuade Shack Dwellers to Relocate Voluntarily</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Illegal new shacks in the restricted areas of this city will be demolished starting today. Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, will personally lead Lu Xia and Song Xueqin, responsible persons of the Traffic Division of the Police Bureau, and six policemen and six artisans to inspect the restricted areas at 8:30 AM this morning. If the new shacks have not been demolished, they will be persuaded to relocate to non-restricted areas voluntarily, otherwise the artisans will dismantle them on their behalf. Director Zhao told reporters yesterday that the purpose of the measure is to protect the safety of everyone and also to prevent the shack dwellers from being in danger. Because the new shacks often do not comply with the regulations of the Public Works Bureau and are adjacent to each other. In the event of a fire, the consequences would be unimaginable. Therefore, it is necessary to ban them.</p>
<h3>Advocating Family Production New Activities in the Women's Circle to Organize Handicraft Production Cooperatives</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The preparatory office of the Shanghai Women's Handicraft Production Cooperative hosted the news media and people's representatives from various districts of the city at the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Wang Bihua, the initiator of the cooperative, reported on the motivation for its organization, saying that in recent years, prices have risen sharply, and the monthly salary income of general public educators and staff is only enough to cover the expenses of a few days, and family life is severely threatened. It is impossible to serve with peace of mind. In order to seek a solution, our women should take part of the responsibility and spontaneously organize women's handicraft production cooperatives to meet the needs of the current era. The cooperative's business is divided into two types: cooperative-run and self-run, which are promoted separately. The cooperative-run departments are divided into six types: sewing, embroidery, weaving, children's educational toys, art books, and by-product processing. The raw materials are purchased or the goods are manufactured by the cooperative for unified management, distributed to the members, and guided to make them at home. After the finished products are made, the cooperative pays reasonable wages according to the number of pieces, and at the end of the year, the members engaged in production can also withdraw product dividends. In the self-run part, all members who have production skills, regardless of the type of business, can operate individually in their family unit and entrust the cooperative to sell them at home and abroad and supply them to various consumer cooperatives in the city. The self-run production is responsible for its own profits and losses, but at the end of the year, if there is a surplus, 5% or more of the net profit should be withdrawn as the cooperative's public surplus.</p>
<p>The cooperative was initiated by Wang Jihua, Tian Shujun, Jin Zhenzhu, etc., and has been supported by municipal councilors Xu Ji, Xi Yushu, Zhan Wenhu, and Wang Xianqing. It is scheduled to publicly recruit shares starting on the 15th of this month, with each share costing 10 yuan in national currency. The minimum purchase for a member is 1,000 shares, totaling 10,000 yuan. It has been decided to formally establish it in April next spring. The preparatory office is located at 75 Wujiang Road.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Disputes Abound, Social Affairs Bureau Mediating</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Workers of the French tram company requested adjustment of job grades and the formulation of annual promotion regulations. Because workers' grades have been lowered and their treatment has been poor in the past few years, they demanded compensation. Because it involves public utilities and is of great importance, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau and Director of the Labor Department are directly mediating.</p>
<p>Workers in the city's oil pressing industry demanded improvement in treatment, with two main requirements: (1) Salary increase. The minimum salary is 1.3 yuan, and the maximum salary is 2.2 yuan, calculated according to the worker's living or index. (2) The daily work is limited to eight hours. The employers said that the oil pressing industry is currently in a downturn and could not agree. The mediator of the Social Affairs Bureau proposed a compromise: (1) The maximum daily salary is set at 2 yuan. (2) Daily work is 10 hours. Mediation is still in progress, and no settlement agreement has been reached.</p>
<p>Labor-management disputes have occurred in the British American Tobacco Company, and the head of the Social Affairs Bureau and the Director of the Labor Department are directly mediating. In addition, the annual bonus issue of the China Tobacco Factory has not been resolved as of yesterday.</p>
<h3>Former Residents of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate Continue to Bid, Appeal to the City Council</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau, entrusted by the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau of the Su, Zhejiang and Anhui Regions, held a second auction of enemy and puppet real estate. A portion of it was formally auctioned on the 26th of last month. According to Item 11 of the Bidding Instructions: "The enemy and puppet houses that have been auctioned must be cleared out within 20 days after signing the reservation." The original residents were in an uproar when they heard the news and are now running around in many ways, hoping that the Executive Yuan will withdraw the order. In addition, all residents of this city who use enemy and puppet houses have now sent a letter to the Municipal Council, appealing, the original letter said: "I read in the newspaper that the Central Trust Bureau announced the auction of 39 units of enemy and puppet houses, and claimed that once the houses are auctioned, the original residents must move out within one month, etc. It is found that some of the tenants in the 39 units of enemy and puppet houses were old tenants before the victory. Under the oppression of the enemy, they still maintained their lease rights. How can they be forced to move after the restoration of the country? Some of them are government officials who came to Shanghai from the rear. During the Anti-Japanese War, they have worked hard to chase the government. Now they have returned to Shanghai with the government. Under this severe housing shortage, how can poor government officials have gold bars to rent and top off the houses? It is not easy to obtain a unit of enemy and puppet houses from the Central Trust Bureau. Now the government wants to auction it off and force them to move. May I ask what remaining money government officials have to rent and top off gold bar houses? They will inevitably sleep on the streets. How can the government bear it? It seems inappropriate in terms of emotion and reason. Therefore, since the Central Trust Bureau announced the auction, all residents of the enemy and puppet houses in various alleys have unanimously opposed it, requesting to maintain the original lease rights, and the opinion community has also risen to discuss it, saying that the government's auction of enemy and puppet houses to enrich the national treasury is, in principle, extremely supportive, but after the auction, the original residents must move out. The authorities in charge seem to have not considered the reality too much. Because very few people went to register for the auction before, and the Central Trust Bureau also temporarily retained it because all sectors of society did not agree with the opinion. However, it is read in the newspaper today that the Central Trust Bureau is going to auction 12 units of enemy and puppet houses such as 181 Minhang Road again (bidding is scheduled to open on the 12th of this month). Is this decision to auction another test after the attitudes of all sectors have calmed down, or has the original proposal been revoked and the lease rights of the current residents maintained? Before we understand, we will not discuss it for the time being. However, we are deeply afraid that the Central Trust Bureau will ignore public opinion and stick to its own opinions. We dare to appeal to the officials of the Municipal Council and ask them to suggest to the government that it should deliberate on the facts before implementing a policy and correct the unreasonable measures of the Central Trust Bureau. Auction as you may, the lease rights of the original residents must be maintained. The minimum living standards of the people, such as food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, must not be deprived. Otherwise, the residents of all enemy and puppet houses in the city (about 10,000 people) will unite to petition the government and the people's opinion organs such as the Municipal Council in order to avoid the suffering of displacement. I hope that the wise officials will pay attention to this."</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Medicine and Hygiene</h3>
<p>(1) Child with Ringworm on Back</p>
<p>Zhu Hengzi asks</p>
<p>A two or three-month-old boy has ringworm on his back. At first, it was only the size of a silver coin, round. In the past month, it has gradually expanded. I am afraid that it will spread to other places, so I applied "Amolin", but this medicine is very painful after application and damages the skin. A two or three-month-old child cannot bear it. I don't know what method or medicine to use for treatment?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin of Medicine] Whether it is ringworm is a question. It is best to consult a dermatologist for a detailed diagnosis, which is more appropriate. "Amolin" may be irritating and is not suitable for children.</p>
<p>(2) Persistent Cough</p>
<p>Zhu Xiuzhen asks My little daughter is one year and nine months old. She had a cough in the first half of the year. The doctor said it was whooping cough. After taking the medicine, it improved a little, but she still coughed and choked in the second half of the night. Last month, she had the flu and coughed frequently. She still played as usual during the day, and her diet was normal. Every morning at five o'clock, there was a wheezing sound in her trachea, and her breathing was not smooth, so she could not sleep anymore, which was very painful. After being diagnosed and treated by a doctor, the medicine did not work. Taking Paleto and cough syrup did not work either. I don't know what disease it is and how to treat it?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin of Medicine] Go to the pediatric hospital for examination and X-ray fluoroscopy of the lungs, take cod liver oil and strontium tablets daily, supplement with fresh air and sunlight, and whooping cough vaccine injection must be decided after a doctor's examination.</p>
<h3>Visiting Traces</h3>
<p>Looking for Cao Xiaochun A neighbor, Mrs. Yang, adopted an orphan nephew named Cao Xiaochun more than a decade ago. Zhou, an underground worker in Shanghai, introduced him to the army in western Zhejiang in the winter of the year before last. He has not communicated since he left. The old man is looking forward to it and washes his face with tears every day. I would like to ask your newspaper to publish it on his behalf. Those who know his whereabouts, please send a letter to Mrs. Yang, No. 1, Lane 857, Huazhong Road. Reader Zhou Jiahui</p>
<p>Looking for younger brother Qu Qi A native of Nanhai, Guangdong. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he has been in the army in Qujiang. It is rumored that he has been promoted to the rank of colonel due to his accumulated merits. However, due to the evil forces of the enemy and puppet regimes at that time, he was unable to communicate. Now, where has he been promoted and transferred to? There is no way to find out. Now, please ask your column to find him on his behalf. If I see the newspaper, I hope to contact 294 Nanjing West Road, Shanghai, on the second floor as soon as possible. Qu Baoguang, from Nanhai District, Guangdong, respectfully informs</p>
<p>Looking for friend Wu Wenzhi (Loyalty) 22 years old, male, from Yangxian County, Shaanxi. He joined the Third Regiment of the Youth Expeditionary Force in Chongqing in August 1944, went to India and then graduated from the first training class of the New First Army. Since then, there has been no news of him. It is heard that this unit has returned to China, but I don't know where it is stationed. If his colleagues or friends know his whereabouts, please send a letter to Wan Baoquan, Police Branch of Changshu Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Looking for younger brother Yang Shizong (from Pingyuan, Guangdong) He studied in the junior high school department of Jinan University in Shanghai in the autumn of 1935. After the August 13 Incident, the school moved into the concession. In the winter of 1938, he received a letter from him, still studying in the high school department of the original school. Since then, news has been cut off. Since the victory, I have been working in Beijing and Shanghai, and I have visited everywhere without success. I am deeply saddened by the separation of my flesh and blood. I have always admired your newspaper for serving the public and caring for the people. Please publish it so that the flesh and blood can be reunited. I am grateful. If Shizong's teachers, friends and classmates hear about his whereabouts, please also send a letter to "The General Headquarters of the Fifth Ordnance Depot in Xuzhou". Yang Shicheng bows</p>

<h3>Hope for Prompt Settlement of Foreign Exchange for Imported Cotton The Cost of Waiting One Day for a Barge is Not Small</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The import and export industry in this city is actively investigating the amount of cotton used annually before the war, the amount of cotton used after the war, and the current actual needs. Detailed statistics will be made and submitted to the Provisional Import Management Committee as a reference when deciding the import volume of cotton. In addition, the Import and Export Association of this city held a group meeting today. Because raw cotton is currently the main import product, the Cotton Group held a meeting on the 9th to discuss the issue of applying for the history of cotton ordered abroad on November 17 and the issue of import permits for cotton that has already arrived. In particular, the solution to the latter problem is imminent, because the cost of waiting one day for each barge is about 1 million yuan, which is really beyond the ability of import and export merchants to bear. Relevant people hope that the government can deal with this matter leniently, because the announcement of the import permit system was completely sudden, and the business community was not prepared in advance, so the orders placed abroad could not adapt to the government's intentions. At the same time, President Song has expressed his willingness to release the foreign exchange quota for real cotton purchases. The government is currently still studying the quota limit for the import of various commodities, and the decision is pending. Once the decision is made, the distribution will be handled by the association itself in principle. It is reported that British and American import and export merchants have strengthened contacts with the Import and Export Association. According to insiders in the import and export industry, the amount of foreign cotton imported today is the largest for American cotton, followed by Indian cotton, and then Egyptian and Brazilian cotton. Indian cotton is already under the control of the Indian government, and a permit must be obtained before export.</p>
<h3>Gold Weak, US Dollar Firm, Hong Kong Notes and Exchange Rates Also Slightly Recovered</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot gold continued to weaken due to tight credit. The morning opening price was between 2,865,000 and 2,870,000, but it immediately showed instability. The Central Bank still intervened with force, and floating prices were quickly cut. Physical gold also became weak as it entered the market. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 150 bars at a price of 2,840,000. Subsequently, the price briefly dropped below 2,835,000 before stabilizing. Soon after, the wind shifted slightly, and those with surplus funds, as well as remittances from other regions, pushed the price up to 2,865,000 near noon. At noon, the price fluctuated around 2,855,000. In the afternoon, the next-day delivery market was initially stable but then weakened, and the price ultimately hovered around 2,850,000. As a result, the closing price was 20,000 lower than the previous day. Gold ornaments were priced at 3,020,000, while sycee silver and silver dollars remained unchanged. Hidden interest rates remained between 1.2 and 1.5 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies turned weak again yesterday. The US dollar on the black market fell from 5050 yuan to below 5000 yuan. At noon, it fluctuated around the 5000 yuan mark. The afternoon was stable with little change, and there was demand at 5000 yuan. As a result, the closing price showed no significant change from the previous day. Hong Kong notes weakened slightly due to the gold market's telegraphic transfer rates, resulting in a slight recovery of ten yuan compared to the previous day's close. The Hong Kong exchange rate slightly recovered to around 990 yuan yesterday. Indian exchange rates were between 1180 yuan and 1200 yuan, and British exchange rates were between 15,800 yuan and 16,000 yuan. Only Hong Kong exchange rates saw some trading activity, while the rest remained quiet.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Yarn Allocation to Yarn Merchants: Mayor Wu Decides to First Allocate to Retail Merchants; Overall Adjustment Measures Are Being Drafted</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The 1,500 bales of cotton yarn allocated by the Municipal Cotton Yarn Joint Distribution Association to retail merchant members of the Yarn Merchants Association could have been distributed last Saturday. However, the distribution was interrupted because the wholesale merchant members of the association insisted on equal treatment and requested the distribution association to temporarily reserve the 1,500 bales until a solution was found. It is learned that yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the chairman of the association, Tang Zhiliang, and executive directors Zhou Jiasheng and Shen Boqin, went to the Municipal Government to meet with Wu, the concurrently serving chairman of the Textile Control Committee, to seek a solution. Chairman Wu stated that the request from the wholesale merchants of the association could not be considered for the time being and personally wrote an instruction, stating: "The 1,500 bales of cotton yarn allocated to retail merchants by the Yarn Merchants Association should temporarily be distributed to retail merchants according to the decision of the Textile Control Committee. As for the overall adjustment measures, the textile associations of the six districts are currently consulting with the central government and the Textile Control Committee to draft them." The above instruction will be posted in the yarn market today and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Dull; Series E Unified Bonds Draw 18 Winning Numbers</h3>
<p>The bond market fluctuated yesterday. Series C Unified Bonds opened at 1110 yuan in the morning, and were sold by Fuyuan and others, falling to 1090 yuan. Rooms 5013 and 6004 bought in, and the price rose to 1210 yuan mid-day, eventually fluctuating between 1150 yuan and 1170 yuan. Compared to the previous day's close, Series A and B fell by 30 yuan, Series C rose by 20 yuan, Series D was unchanged, and Series E also rose by 60 yuan. The trading volume was over 4 million.

The winning numbers for Series E Unified Bonds were 027, 227, 123, 202, 206, 249, 400, 415, 487, 535, 560, 695, 763, 768, 811, 843, 937, 916.</p>
<h3>Tea Sales Exceptionally Quiet</h3>
<p>It has been observed that various domestic teas such as Longjing, Shuangdang, Dafang, and Baozhong have traditionally been sold in large quantities to merchants from other regions. However, because the fancy teas that fellow merchants shipped to Tianjin and Yingkou after the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar have not yet been sold out, trading is exceptionally quiet. As for the foreign tea market, high-end aged Keemun tea is being purchased by foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson. Unfortunately, market supply is depleted, and those holding the goods are asking exorbitant prices, leading to mostly unfavorable negotiations. As for green teas like Chunmee and Gunpowder, there is demand from places like Africa and Morocco. However, due to a lack of ships and demanding pricing, as well as the lack of clear regulations on the exchange rate between China and the French franc, it is reported that a large sum of French francs was telegraphed from that area to a certain bank in this city some time ago, but it has been difficult to exchange it, making it difficult to promote sales for the time being. Currently, tea merchants in this city are deeply hoping for assistance from the local authorities.</p>
<h3>Silk Generally Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the price of 120-count bright rayon fell again due to sellers entering the market. Tianqiao new goods were quoted at 3.6 million yuan in the morning, but fell by 100,000 yuan in the afternoon. Gaoshan was traded at 3.3 million yuan in the morning and 3.2 million yuan in the afternoon. The remaining Dull Rayon and 150-count bright rayon remained unchanged from the previous day due to a lack of allocation. The raw silk market was quiet with very little activity. Quotations did not change much, and the price of dried silk was slightly lower due to few buyers. Piece goods remained flat and weak, with very little trading. Although yesterday's damask prices remained at the previous day's levels, there was a lack of demand. Checkered satin saw a small decrease of 100 yuan, while the prices of other goods remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Mulberry Seedling Loans Totaling 400 Million Yuan to be Handled by China Sericulture Corporation</h3>
<p>The China Sericulture Corporation is actively promoting the silk industry improvement plan for the coming year. Currently, the first thing to be implemented is the mulberry seedling loan program. The corporation estimates that a total of 27 million mulberry seedlings will be planted next year: (1) 5 million Yang (Jiaxing Yangdong) grafted seedlings, with a loan of 5 yuan per seedling; (2) 20 million Guang (Guangde) grafted seedlings, with a loan of 8 yuan per seedling; (3) 2 million common grafted seedlings, with a loan of 10 yuan per seedling; (4) 100 million transplanted seedlings, with a loan of 3 yuan per seedling. The total amount will be limited to 400 million yuan in national currency. It is planned that an agreement will be reached with the lending bank this month to begin processing the loans.</p>
<h3>Woolens Market Calm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, inspections of various tea house markets showed that the woolens market could be described as calm. Standard prices were mostly stable. Due to the pressure of high-interest loans, the entire commercial sector, both local and out-of-town, was unstable. Although there was still a whole month left for winter sales and news of profitable deals was heard from time to time, the overall woolens market remained difficult to improve. The practice of hoarding has not only disappeared, but most merchants have reversed their attitude from previous years and are looking to sell off their inventory to raise funds.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Calls for Relief After the Closure of Xin Da Silk Factory; China and Communications Banks Continue to Process Loans</h3>
<p>Since the Four Joint Offices approved the silk weaving industry loan, which was to be handled by China and Communications Banks, the industry has repeatedly requested flexibility regarding the loan terms, which were initially set at 70% for raw materials and 30% for finished products. Subsequently, President Bei of the Central Bank, sympathetic to the difficulties faced by the industry, approved a change to 50% for raw materials and 50% for finished products, which the industry agreed to. On November 25, China and Communications Banks began processing applications. On December 5, after Xin Da Silk Factory received a loan of 1 billion yuan, it immediately announced its liquidation. Therefore, on December 7, the industry association sent Cai Yitao and Liu Qingyi to meet with Lin Fengbao, director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and deputy director Gong Zishuang, while also inviting Sun Zuirui, deputy manager of China Bank, and Zhu Tongjiu, chief auditor of Communications Bank, to report on the current plight of the industry. Director Lin then stated that a meeting would be held again on December 9. At 3:00 PM on December 9, the meeting was held at the Central Bank, attended by Lin Fengbao and Wang Zishuang from the Central Bank, Wang Zhitong and Zhou Dagang from the Central Trust Bureau, Sun Fengrui and Ma Zhunliang from China Bank, Zhu Tongjiu and Yu Jieqiong from Communications Bank, Ge Jingzhong and Wang Yinyao from the China Sericulture Corporation, and silk weaving industry representatives Liu Qingyi and Cai Yitao. First, Liu Qingyi reported on the current situation of the industry. Then, Mo Jingzhong from the China Sericulture Corporation expressed his opinion, stating that the silk weaving industry is one of the largest industries in China and is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood, and that efforts should be made to solve its current difficulties so that it can overcome the challenges. Subsequently, ways to resolve the situation were discussed, and the results were very satisfactory. China and Communications Banks continue to process loans today. It is reported that the silk weaving industry will hold a general membership meeting this afternoon (December 10) to discuss solutions and provide them to the authorities for adoption.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Stabilized, Oil Prices Rebounded, Raw Peanut and Corn Sales Active</h3>
<p>A total of more than 13,000 dan of rice arrived from both the North and South. Retailers' sales were normal, and the market showed signs of decline. Southern japonica rice fell by 1,000 yuan, and Northern japonica rice also fell by a small amount of 300-500 yuan. Indica rice was scarce and stable, while white and gray silver dollars remained flat and weak. Soybean oil futures showed activity, increasing by another 300-500 yuan. Soybean cake prices stabilized temporarily. Wheat flour prices were firm inland, and sales were average. Wheat bran prices decreased slightly by 100-200 yuan. Wheat arrivals were intermittent, and the market was stable, with sales occurring as soon as goods arrived. Mung beans saw very little demand from Southeast Asia, but domestic demand was very active, with prices rising by 1,000 yuan. Red beans saw both arrivals and sales slow, showing no significant change. Sesame saw active sales to merchants from Guangdong, with prices rising by another 1,000-2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were also being purchased by Guangdong merchants and were active in the local market, with prices rising by another 1,000-2,000 yuan. Corn from Qingdao saw very strong demand, with demand exceeding supply, making it a scarce commodity, and prices rose sharply by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Broad beans remained stable. The oil market saw active retailer purchases, with both raw soybean oil and refined soybean oil rising uniformly by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil also rose by 2,000-3,000 yuan.

<h3>Cotton Spinning Association Subcommittee Meeting Has Not Yet Reached Concrete Results on Regulating the Market and Eliminating the Black Market</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Cotton Spinning Association of the six districts recently convened a general membership meeting, resulting in the creation of a nine-member subcommittee to formulate plans to regulate the yarn and cloth market and reduce the black market. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, the subcommittee held a meeting, attended by Tang Xinghai, Rong Yixin, Guo Qiong, Liu Jingji, Lu Zidong, Xi Yushu, and others. It is reported that the following four measures were proposed for study: "(1) Restore free trading. (2) Restore textile mill posted pricing. (3) Establish standard prices for various yarn counts. (4) Adopt a yarn-for-cotton exchange method, with the principle of exchanging one bale of yarn for one bale of cotton." The attendees had no objections to the first three measures. It is reported that the fourth measure was considered somewhat restrictive. The meeting adjourned at around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, but no concrete results were achieved. This morning at 11:00 AM, the association will convene another executive council meeting to discuss the opinions and experiences of the subcommittee, make further adjustments, and then make a final decision.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office Consults on Recent Industry Conditions</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Ouyang Lun, director of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, convened a meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM with the responsible persons of various important industrial trade associations in the city. Representatives from over thirty trade associations, including tobacco, silk weaving, woolen textiles, and dyeing, attended. Director Ouyang delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of the meeting was to understand the current situation of the industrial sector in the city, and he invited representatives from various industries to present their own situations and submit detailed reports for review. The industry representatives then presented their opinions in turn. The opinions of the representatives generally revolved around the following: (1) Interest rates are too high. (2) Wages are too expensive. (3) Taxes are numerous and tax rates are high. (4) Imported goods are being dumped, threatening domestic goods. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Leather Goods Industry Sluggish; Two Companies Have Declared Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>There are over one hundred leather goods firms in the city that engage in export, with about ten of them being larger in scale. Only one or two firms trade directly with foreign countries. Recently, due to the sluggish leather goods market, it has been reported that two firms have declared bankruptcy, with the debt of one firm being 160-170 million yuan and the other being 70-80 million yuan. The reasons for the bankruptcies are that their capital was insufficient, their businesses were too broad, and the interest on their external debts increased daily. In the current lifeless leather goods industry, they were unable to sustain themselves.</p>
<h3>Fertilizer Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The price of fertilizer has risen by 150,000 yuan per ton, from 1,500,000 yuan to 1,650,000 yuan, in the past week. Demand from out-of-town merchants and the local market is strong. Zinc powder was previously imported in large quantities, and the goods were quite sluggish. However, since there have been no recent imports, the market inventory has also decreased, so the price has increased from 1,500,000 yuan to 1,800,000 yuan per ton. Glycerin sales have become more active, and the market price is 180,000 yuan per dan. Merchants are unwilling to sell easily. In February of this year, the market price of glycerin was once as high as 400,000 yuan per dan. Later, due to the large number of imports from the US, the price gradually fell. Currently, US goods are scarce on the market, and only Chinese-French triangular glycerin is available. Sulfuric acid is no longer being purchased, and the price is still falling.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Soybeans and Soybean Oil Arrive in Shanghai</h3>

<p>Ministry of Education Inspection Team Expresses Opinions</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper in Shenyang on the 10th] Student protests have erupted at National Northeast University due to the prolonged period of repatriation.

<h3>Shandong Education Repatriation Faces Two Major Difficulties</h3>
<p>Li Taihua Scheduled to Fly to Beijing to Report</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper in Jinan] Before the Shandong Provincial Government repatriated to Jinan after the victory, various colleges and universities remained in Fuyang, and the issue of repatriation had not been fully resolved. Regarding this issue of education repatriation, Education Director Li Taihua stated, "There are currently two major difficulties with the repatriation of colleges and universities remaining in Fuyang. First, the repatriation funds have still not been secured. The three yuan issued by the Ministry of Education has already been completely spent. Second, there are difficulties in relocation after repatriation. It is impossible for the colleges and universities remaining in Fuyang to return to their original campuses in Jinan, and finding new school buildings is beyond our capabilities. I am scheduled to fly to Beijing next week to report to the central government on this issue and the general issue of education repatriation throughout the province, in the hope of a quick solution."</p>

<h3>Textbook Revision Work to be Completed Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 10th] Minister of Education Wang Tao stated that the curriculum standards and textbooks currently used in schools at all levels are no longer applicable because they were revised during wartime. The Ministry has convened a meeting of experts to discuss and plan to revise the curriculum standards and correct the textbooks edited based on the old curriculum standards.

<h3>Middle School Speech Contest to be Held for One Week</h3>
<p>The Municipal Middle School Students' Mandarin Speech Contest was originally scheduled to hold preliminary rounds on the 15th of this month and final rounds on the 22nd. More than sixty schools have registered, but many have requested that the dates be postponed, citing the short timeframe and lack of preparation. The Bureau of Education believes that since the original intention of this speech contest was to have widespread participation from public and private secondary schools, it should take their difficulties into account and avoid excluding them from participating. The bureau has approved a one-week postponement, with the preliminary rounds rescheduled for the 22nd of this month and the final rounds rescheduled for the 29th. The registration deadline has been extended to the 20th.</p>
<h3>French Journalist's Novel, "Dust of the Times," Wins Literary Prize</h3>
<p>[Report from the French News Agency in Paris on the 9th] The 1946 Prix Cordonnier has been awarded to French journalist Niles. His novel, "Dust of the Times," depicts the life of a banker who, after failing on the stock exchange, believes that his past life is not worth remembering. He returns to his mansion, recalls the most memorable events of his life, and then opens the window, leading the reader to believe that he has committed suicide.</p>
<h3>Importers with Registered American Goods to be Allowed to Import; Those Without Registration Will Be Treated as Abandoned</h3>
<p>The Import Management Committee originally stipulated that importers who ordered goods from the US before the 17th of last month that had not yet been shipped, or that were shipped before the 24th of last month, had two weeks to complete registration procedures. Subsequently, at the request of import businesses, the deadline was extended to yesterday (the 9th). It is reported that the committee has decided not to extend the deadline further. Any importers who fail to register by the deadline will be considered to have waived their rights and will not be allowed to import their goods. It is reported that the claim that some goods will not be allowed to be imported is not true, according to the person in charge of the committee. Furthermore, it has been learned that importers can apply to import goods at any time that arrive after the 17th. Production equipment listed in Appendix 1 and various goods listed in Appendix 3 do not require allocation measures. Only imported goods listed in Appendix 2 will be subject to allocation. However, before the allocation measures are determined, those who are interested can apply at any time. If manufacturers do not entrust import businesses, they can apply directly. As of yesterday, a total of over 3,000 import businesses have registered, and the Committee is currently reviewing them. Many of the application forms filled out by import businesses do not comply with the regulations, especially in the sections for the name of the imported goods and the applicant's quantity. The Committee has returned these forms to the original applicants for completion.</p>
<h3>28 Leather Factories Close Amidst Industrial and Commercial Crisis</h3>
<p>There are a total of 350 small and medium-sized leather manufacturing factories in the city. Due to the pressure of high-interest loans, 28 factories have closed so far. With the end of the year approaching, it is expected that many factories will have difficulty surviving the year-end closure. In addition to high-interest loans, the reasons for the closures include: (1) The dumping of glazed leather goods, (2) Increased wages, (3) Difficulties in transportation to other cities. Currently, most leather goods factories are in a semi-suspended state, with only a dozen workers manufacturing large leather trunks to keep the business alive. It is reported that over a thousand leather workers have lost their jobs under these heavy pressures.</p>
<h3>Fertilizer Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The price of fertilizer has increased from 1.5 million yuan to 1.65 million yuan per ton in the past week. Demand from merchants and local buyers is strong. A large quantity of zinc sulfide powder was previously imported, and the goods were quite sluggish. Since there have been no recent imports, the market inventory has also decreased, so the price has increased from 1.5 million yuan to 1.8 million yuan per ton. Glycerin sales have become more active, and the market price is 180,000 yuan per dan. Merchants are unwilling to sell easily. In February of this year, the market price of glycerin reached 400,000 yuan per dan. Later, due to the large number of imports from the US, the price gradually fell. Currently, US goods are scarce on the market, and only Chinese-French triangular glycerin is available. Sulfuric acid is no longer being purchased, and the price is still falling.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Soybeans and Soybean Oil Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship transported goods from Tianjin to Shanghai, including over 1,880 bags of soybeans and 305 barrels of soybean oil. Furthermore, the Haixuan ship sailed to Keelung the day before yesterday, carrying 18,300 large soybean cakes, 55,400 small soybean cakes, over 540 bags of soybeans, and 275 pieces of hemp heads.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The price of grade A sugar set by the association was 134,000 yuan, up 500 yuan. Raw sand grade A was 118,000-119,000 yuan. Shantou's grade A sugar was 95,000-96,000 yuan, and re-roasted red sugar was 100,500-103,000 yuan, with 200-300 bags traded. Guangdong's Runde grade A sugar was 98,000 yuan, and Qingyuan's covered slice grade A sugar was 83,000 yuan, with dozens of pieces traded. Xinghua's grade A white powder sugar opened at 131,000-130,000 yuan, and red sugar opened at 120,000 yuan to 115,000-116,000-118,000 yuan, with one hundred or more bags traded.</p>
<h3>Casing Trade Depressed; Fresh Casing Purchase Prices Still Low in This City; Finished Product Exports Still Require Discounts</h3>
<p>The market price for fresh pig casings in this city is still around 1,300-1,400 yuan per set. It is reported that market prices in inland cities such as Songjiang are even higher than in this city. According to people in the trade, the price of fresh casings before the war was equivalent to the price of fresh meat. For example, if fresh meat was 2 jiao per jin, fresh casings should also be priced at that amount. However, at that time, the price of casings abroad was also high. Although the current price of fresh casings is considered low, the finished product still requires discounts because the price in New York is still uncertain. Although the market in Europe is better, the French franc exchange rate makes it impossible to settle accounts, so it is still unprofitable.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Bank Decides to Support Taiwan Tea Exports</h3>
<p>Tea exports are still extremely difficult due to high costs and large price differences. However, Taiwan tea is very inexpensive. President Chou Jingwei and other directors of the Tea Industry Association plan to engage in export operations and have requested loan funds from the China Land Bank. The Agricultural Bank has decided to provide financial assistance. It is reported that Shou and others will travel to Taiwan within the week to plan. It is understood that the Union Tea Company is targeting Europe and the United States and has an annual production of 3,000 tons. Prices are stable in Taiwan, life is stable, and the cost of tea is extremely low, more than half that of tea in the mainland. Therefore, the prospects for export are very promising.</p>
<h3>Cotton Industry Association Deems Restrictions on Indian Cotton Exports Inappropriate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 9th] The East India Cotton Association has written to the Indian government, urging the central government to consider and announce its cotton policy as soon as possible. The letter pointed out that the Indian government's cotton control policy has violated government regulations and created a black market. Regarding the cotton export policy, the association agreed with the large quantity of exports allowed this season, but opposed the principle of levying a cotton export tax. The association stated that cotton has always been a surplus commodity in India, and India has always exclusively produced short-staple cotton. Therefore, exports of this type of cotton must be maintained to ensure that the economic interests of the country and cotton farmers are not affected. The association fears that restricting the export of cotton with a staple length of 11/16 inch and above would be dangerous, as Indian mills have never consumed all of the cotton produced with a staple length of 13/16 inch. Some quantity of this type of cotton can be allowed for export without hindering Indian mills. Otherwise, if this type of cotton remains in the market, the general price of cotton will inevitably be suppressed.</p>

<p>Methods for Height Measurement</p>
<p>(A) Height: When measuring height, the person being measured should remove their shoes (preferably wearing only shorts), stand in front of the height scale, arms naturally hanging down, chest out, abdomen in, knees straight, heels together, and toes apart. The heels and back should be in contact with the vertical post of the height scale. The head should be held straight, with the eyes looking straight ahead. The measurer should stand to the side of the person being measured, using one hand to support the back of their head and the index finger of the other hand to touch the lower edge of the eye socket to see if it is level with the upper edge of the ear canal. The measurer should also gently press the abdomen with one hand to make it contract. At this point, the measurer can observe the posture of the person being measured from the front and side to ensure it meets the standard. Then, with a swift movement, place the horizontal ruler on the vertex of the person being measured and accurately read the value. The unit of record is centimeters, rounded to the nearest centimeter.</p>
<p>Methods for Weight Measurement</p>
<p>(B) Weight: When measuring weight, the person being measured should wear at most shorts or an outer garment with a known weight, which should be subtracted after the measurement.

Use a measuring tape from behind, under the armpits, around to the front, so that the measuring tape is below the shoulder blades in the back and on the upper part of the nipples in the front (for women with large breasts, it should be placed on a slightly higher chest surface), so that the measuring tape crosses at the right nipple. The value should be recorded at the end of exhalation but before inhalation. The unit of record is centimeters, rounded to the nearest centimeter.</p>
<p>Methods for Total Body Strength Measurement</p>
<p>(D) Total Body Strength: During the test, the person being tested should stand on the footplate of the total body strength meter, feet ten centimeters apart, toes at a forty-five-degree angle, body slightly leaning forward (thirty degrees), hands gripping the bar.

<p>Methods for Running Test (Boys and Girls)</p>
<p>(F) 50 Meters (Girls, Junior High Boys), 100 Meters (Senior High Boys): (1) When testing the 50-meter or 100-meter run, two people should be in a group and start simultaneously, using a crouching start. Before starting, the person being tested should stand behind the starting line. When the starter calls the first command, "On your marks," they should squat on the ground, preparing for the starting position. After the second command, "Set," is called, the buttocks should be raised slightly. After the starter blows the whistle, the person should sprint out with force. The starter should wave a red flag when blowing the whistle. (2) The person being tested should run straight ahead. (3) The timer should start the stopwatch when they see the starter wave the red flag and stop the stopwatch as soon as the body of the person being tested reaches the vertical plane of the finish line, and record the time.</p>
<p>Methods for Standing Long Jump Test</p>
<p>(G) Standing Long Jump: (1) There is no limit to the running distance for the person being tested. (2) The person being tested should jump from the takeoff board. (3) The jump distance should be measured at a right angle from the nearest point where any part of the person's body lands to the outer edge of the takeoff board or its extended line. (4) If the person being tested runs past the takeoff board or its extended line, or if any part of their foot touches the ground in front of the takeoff board, it should be counted as one trial jump, and the score will not be measured. (5) Each person is limited to three jumps, with the longest record used as the official score.</p>
<p>Methods for Softball Throwing Test</p>
<p>(H) Softball Throwing: (1) Use a twelve-ounce softball. (2) Throw with one hand from behind the throwing line (must be over the shoulder).

<p>(I) Pull-Ups: (1) Pull-ups are performed on a single bar. (2) Grip the bar with a forward grip and hang. (3) The pull-up is considered complete when the chin passes over the horizontal bar. When the body is hanging down, the arm and elbow joints should be vertical. If the pull-up is attempted again before the arm is fully extended, it will not be counted as one pull-up. (Note) Before the test, the testing methods should be explained in detail to the person being tested and demonstrated.</p>

<h3>Election of Senators at All Levels Limited to Registered Candidates; Ministry of Interior Sends Letter to Municipal Government for Verification</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government approved a letter from the Ministry of Interior stating: The candidates for senators at the provincial, municipal, and county levels should be limited to those who have passed the public office candidate examination or review. In addition, when handling the election of the above-mentioned personnel, a list of candidates should be compiled at the same time as the list of voters is compiled, and the list of candidates should be announced at the same time as the list of voters is announced. These are all clearly stipulated in the Senator Election Regulations.</p>
<p>However, it has been repeatedly reported that there are still those who have not passed the public office candidate examination or have not registered as candidates and have been elected. This is not only illegal but also likely to cause disputes. Therefore, it is stipulated that in the election of senators at all levels in the future, the votes obtained by those who have not registered as candidates should be invalidated. In addition to submitting a report to the Executive Yuan for the record, a letter is hereby sent to you for verification and notification.</p>

<h3>New Agricultural Facilities in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>— Quwo Fast News on the 10th, Special Correspondent Yu Ningpo</p>
<p>Jiangxi is an important agricultural province in southern China. The production of various crops is relatively abundant compared with other provinces. In the past and present, the authorities have made considerable efforts to improve, relieve, and revive agriculture in this province. The reporter may as well give a summary report on the general facilities of agriculture in this province in the past and present:</p>
<p>Evolution of Agriculture in the Past</p>
<p>In the winter of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), in order to revive the rural areas and eradicate banditry, the Jiangxi Provincial Government sent personnel to organize inspection teams to visit agricultural areas such as Ding County, Zouping, and Wuxi to inspect rural undertakings and establish rural improvement societies. Wanjiabu, Anyi County, was selected as the experimental area, and politics, economy, and culture were determined as the goals of improving farmers' lives. At the same time, with the support of the National Committee, three experts from the League of Nations were invited to Jiangxi to conduct on-site inspections. More than one million yuan was allocated from the US cotton and wheat storage funds to subsidize the establishment of cooperative, agricultural, and health agencies. In the autumn of the 23rd year (1934), Shangdundu in Linchuan, Yaocun in Nancheng, Gangshang in Fengcheng, Sanhu in Xingan, Zaotang in Gaoan, and Tujiapu in Yongxiu were selected to establish six rural service areas. In the spring of the 24th year (1935), Qingyunpu in Nanchang, Dunhou Village in Ji'an, Shaxi in Shangrao, and Shishang and other places in Ningdu were selected to establish four service areas. The province's agricultural, educational, health, and cooperative undertakings were used to jointly devote themselves to rural revival and construction. Regarding</p>
<p>Adjustment Work</p>
<p>The "Jiangxi Rural Improvement Undertakings Committee" was established as the agency for adjusting the work. The functions and powers exercised by the committee include: (1) To oversee the implementation of rural experimental undertakings in the province. (2) To review the budgets of the rural experimental areas. (3) To train rural workers. (4) To guide the working methods of the rural experimental areas. (5) To coordinate the implementation steps of the rural experimental areas. (6) To assess the working steps of the rural experimental areas. (7) To preside over economic and social surveys and statistics in the rural experimental areas. (8) To compile and publish work reports from the rural experimental areas. (9) To review the working areas of newly established rural experimental areas in the province. (10) To supervise and urge local governments to promote rural improvement undertakings. And to formulate a</p>
<p>Three-Year Plan</p>
<p>The content of the plan is divided into four items: management, education, cultivation, and health. Regarding the cultivation item: (1) At least 50% of farm households in the entire area can adopt improved seeds. (2) Wastelands and barren lands in the entire area can be fully utilized. (3) Cooperatives are organized in the entire area. (4) 40% of farm households in the entire area should have at least one sideline business in addition to raising pigs and ducks. (5) At least one or two of the following should be available in each Bao in the entire area: Bao forests, Bao ponds, Bao fields, and Bao warehouses. (6) Water conservancy projects such as dike construction and pond excavation should be carried out as needed in the entire area. (7) Farmers in the entire area should make full use of private ponds to raise fish and plant lotus roots to increase production. (8) Farm households in the entire area should effectively reduce the extravagance of weddings and funerals.</p>
<h3>Current Various Facilities</h3>

<p>This year, Jiangxi Province's agricultural facilities, in addition to the central government's allocation of funds to assist agricultural recovery, are all jointly handled by the Provincial Government's Reclamation Office, the Agricultural College, and the Relief Branch, three relevant agencies. Regarding agricultural loan promotion and subsidy, they are actively pursuing them with all their might. In recent years, the three agencies have worked quite hard on matters of agricultural revitalization.</p>
<p>Assisting Recovery</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has allocated a special recovery fund of 83.375 million yuan for assisting the province's agricultural recovery this year. More than ten million yuan have already been allocated to the province. Agencies in this province that implement the distribution of relief materials for post-disaster relief, promote agriculture, the joint federation for propagating and distributing vegetable seeds for agricultural affairs, and guide the use of disease and pest control medicines and machinery and fertilizers for agricultural affairs can all receive special subsidies. In addition to the above-mentioned recovery funds, insect pest control powder, vegetable seeds, chemical fertilizers, and small agricultural tools are being transported from Shanghai to Jiangxi. Furthermore, given that Jiangxi Province's rice harvest loss this year amounted to over 200 billion yuan, in order to increase grain production next year, a movement to protect rice seedlings is being launched in Jiangxi, with the selection of several key points to spray DDT as a demonstration work for seedling cultivation. The Taiwan Cooperation Management Office of this province, in order to support agricultural development, has specially requested an 8 billion yuan loan from the Four Banks Joint Office through the Department of Construction, which has been handed over to the Agricultural Loan Committee for separate approval of its use. The approved amount for agricultural loans in Jiangxi Province this year has reached over 968.76 million yuan, including loans for production, transportation and sales, agricultural warehouses, promotion, sideline industries, water conservancy, and recovery areas. The Agricultural Bank's remaining loan of over 1.49 billion yuan will also focus on assisting farmers' associations in handling agricultural loan business in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Promoting Winter Plowing</p>
<p>In order to encourage farmers in various counties to diligently create a winter plowing atmosphere and seek an increase in agricultural production, the Agricultural College has decided to launch a winter plowing campaign starting this month. The college will be in charge of agricultural publicity throughout the province, while county governments will directly organize activities within their respective counties. Five key points for promoting winter plowing have also been established: (1) This year's winter plowing promotion should be implemented universally. All land within the territory must be planted with winter crops or plowed and irrigated, with no idle land. (2) The personnel responsible for the winter plowing promotion agencies in each county this year and the steps to be taken should be handled in accordance with the previously promulgated regulations of the 34th year of the Republic, and should be earnestly implemented. (3) All barren mountains reclaimed this year must be planted with winter crops. (4) Winter control of rice stem borers must be carried out in accordance with the winter rice stem borer control implementation measures. (5) Winter plowing supervision should be carried out in accordance with the regulations of the 34th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Improving Agricultural Tools</p>
<p>The Provincial Government believes that agricultural production after the war urgently needs to be strengthened. It is now using 20 sets of new-style agricultural tools allocated to Jiangxi by the Executive Headquarters to set up factories in Qi Yan for manufacturing, so that agricultural tools can be mechanized.</p>
<p>Demonstration Farms</p>
<p>(1) To harmonize the relationship between landlords and tenants, improve the lives of tenant farmers, and implement the 25% rent reduction; (2) To realize "land to the tillers" in four counties, namely Ganxian, Shangyou, Xinsheng, and Nankang, seven demonstration areas for supporting self-cultivating farmers will be established. In one township in each county, land will be requisitioned by district segments and allocated to self-cultivating farmers for contracting. (3) In Zhanggongdu, Gao'an, and other places with the most barren land, demonstration farms for revitalization will be established. The Hangzhou cooperative reclamation area and the righteous people's re-cultivation area will be jointly managed by relevant business agencies of the provincial government and economic agencies for military rehabilitation to support rural revitalization.</p>
<p>Supporting Cultivating Farmers</p>
<p>One to three townships have been selected in 13 counties, including Nanchang, Fengcheng, Linchuan, Nancheng, Nanfeng, Guangze, Fuliang, Poyang, Jiujiang, Ganxian, Nankang, Shangyou, and Xin, to establish experimental townships for supporting self-cultivating farmers, implementing a kind of loan for supporting self-cultivating farmers, and allocating public barren land, or requisitioning and allocating private agricultural land and tenant agricultural land. The total area of each demonstration area is 13,290 mu, with a total of 1,681 farm households and a total of 7.962 million yuan in loans.</p>
<p>Increasing Grain Production</p>
<p>For the work of increasing grain production, the Agricultural College is mobilizing farmers to make use of idle or barren land to widely plant miscellaneous grains, while promoting dryland rice. It is also designating nine counties in the Xin River basin, namely Shangrao, Yushan, Qianshan, Hengfeng, Guangfeng, Guixi, Yiyang, Yujiang, and Yugan, to promote planting, allocating 1,000 mu per county and setting a deadline for completion of planting.</p>
<p>Cooperative Farms</p>
<p>The Jiangxi branch of the Relief and Salvation Administration and the Provincial Reclamation Office are assisting in establishing the Zhanggongdu Cooperative Farm. The farm is located in the triangular area on the north bank of Zhanggongdu, with an initial area of 5,000 mu, which will be expanded to 10,000 mu. Initially, 100 reclamation households will be recruited, gradually expanding to 200 households. The farm will provide free plowing cattle, agricultural tools, seedlings, and construction water conservancy materials. The total cost is estimated to be about 200 million yuan, which will be subsidized by the branch office. 100 tents, two bundles of old clothes, and 2,550 small bags of flour will also be allocated to solve the initial problems of clothing, food, and housing. In principle, machinery will be used for power application, and mechanized plowing and irrigation will be tested. Mechanization will also be used as much as possible for dryland farming and sowing. Agriculture will be the main business, with animal husbandry and agricultural product manufacturing as secondary.</p>
<p>Agricultural College Work</p>
<p>From July 1st to September 15th of this year, the Agricultural College has carried out 16 agricultural-related tasks: (1) Conducting rice variety investigations and analysis experiments; (2) Promoting rice seed varieties and guiding seed retention and variety exchange; (3) Adding meteorological observation to facilitate agricultural research; (4) Conducting cooperative crop experiment research with comprehensiveness; (5) Promoting American bridge propagation and management work; (6) Preparing to restore the work of the Southeast Hemp Improvement Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry that has been taken over; (7) Actively carrying out epidemic prevention and control, and enriching equipment and facilities; (8) Preventing and controlling insect pests and trying to manufacture insecticides; (9) Sampling and nurturing tung forests and pre-collecting forest tree seeds; (10) Researching and manufacturing new-style agricultural tools; (11) Propagating and promoting excellent fruits and vegetables; (12) Guiding the establishment of tea gardens and improving tea-making technology; (13) Distributing agricultural relief supplies; (14) Establishing agricultural post-war promotion and guidance agencies; (15) Adjusting the organization of agricultural extension offices in administrative districts; (16) Guiding farmers' associations to carry out self-help undertakings.</p>
<p>Seeking a Way Out</p>
<p>The various agricultural facilities written above are all aimed at the needs of agriculture in this province, that is, the urgent need for the authorities to catch up and find a way out. Because the foundation of Jiangxi's economy is entirely built on agriculture, but the phenomenon of rural collapse has spread from the bottom to the surface, from the countryside to the cities. Especially in the future, the goal of revitalizing the industry is to work from the surface to the bottom, so that the foundation of Jiangxi's social economy will be more consolidated. Other construction problems can be easily solved, and this belief is also the most sincere expectation of the 30 million people of Jiangxi.</p>
<h3>Vignettes of Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>— Air dispatch on the 3rd.  Reported by Liu Zao, our reporter in Nanchang</p>
<p>Dividing Kuling – Xingzi and Jiujiang Compete with Each Other</p>
<p>The division of Kuling has already become a major topic of discussion in the Xingzi County Assembly. Although some people in Jiujiang are considering voluntarily moving Kuling away, due to the dispute over county boundaries, it is unlikely that they will willingly "move it away." Looking at the reasons put forward by Xingzi, it is clear that Kuling does not belong to Jiujiang. Therefore, the current dispute is about whether Kuling belongs to Jiujiang.</p>
<p>Xingzi County believes that the "Detailed Map of Xingzi Borders" attached to the Xingzi County Gazetteer compiled in the tenth year of Tongzhi shows that Kuling is within the jurisdiction of Xingzi. However, the Jiujiang County Gazetteer does not mention that Kuling belongs to Jiujiang. The watershed between the two counties of Jiujiang and Xingzi runs from Wuzhang Mountain, through Xiaotianchi, Dagushan, Tubaling, Zhichuan Peak, Shangshen Peak, to Matouling Peak. Kuling is south of this watershed, so it should be under the jurisdiction of Xingzi. Xingzi County also put forward the recent reason for handling the household registration of Kuling, saying: In the 25th year of the Republic, the Xingzi County Government sent personnel to Kuling to handle household affairs. A Juren from Dehua secretly sold Kuling to foreigners, but Xingzi gentry strongly opposed it, and it was changed to leasing. They are now determined to argue their case based on these reasons.</p>
<h3>Commissioner's Office – Equivalent to a Document Forwarding Agency</h3>
<p>Regarding the argument that the Administrative Commissioner's Office should be a business agency, all parties believe that there is a need for improvement. The Five-Year Construction Plan of Jiangxi Province may also suggest that the central government abolish the Commissioner's Office and change it to a supervisory agency. The agency will be named the Supervisory Office, with two directors or chiefs. All the inspectors of the provincial government's various units will be concentrated in each region for supervision, without handling general administrative affairs. The current Commissioner's Office, although named as supervision, is actually only equivalent to a document forwarding agency.</p>
<h3>The Tomorrow of the Longhai Railway</h3>
<p>— Air dispatch on the 3rd.  Reported by Li Chi, our reporter in Xi'an</p>
<p>On the map of China's railway system, if the Pinghan Road and the Yuehan Road are connected like the "dressing to the right" posture in the "Infantry Drill Manual," then the Longhai Railway is like the "arms outstretched in a 'T'" position. This major trunk line, running continuously eastward, forms a large cross with the two straight lines.</p>
<p>In recent years, the transportation status of the Longhai Railway has been unsatisfactory to all parties. This is an undisguised fact. The reporter is not very clear about its "reputation" in Henan, but in Shaanxi, the criticism of the Longhai Railway has become a routine item at every Provincial Assembly and Municipal Provisional Assembly meeting, especially the fact that the transportation volume is insufficient for people's needs has long been the central issue.</p>
<p>Of course, the railway authorities also have difficulties. Summarizing the reasons for their past defenses, they are nothing more than the lack and obsolescence of transportation equipment, the heavy traffic of troops and military supplies, and the insecurity of some sections of the railway line... But we also want to ask: The rampant black market ticket sales at stations, the blatant extortion by ticket inspectors on trains, the lack of order on stations and trains, even the open-top freight cars, crammed with people groping in the dark, without even a light on each car... Are these things theoretically or actually related to the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" not providing new locomotives?</p>
<p>The reporter once heard someone who had been recording price data here for several years say that almost every price increase in Xi'an in recent years was attributed to reports that the Longhai Railway lacked military wagons. The reporter has also felt the same way during his two years in Shaanxi. Not to mention distant events, but recently, food prices have soared by more than double, coal has also risen, and so has oil. There is no incident that is not blamed on the railway bureau's lack of transportation capacity. However, is the transportation capacity really so unavailable? We are quite hesitant to give a definite yes or no answer. I remember that two months ago, fuel was expensive in Xi'an, so the kerosene transported from Gansu to this place via Lingbao was also expensive. People wanted to buy from the state-run domestic kerosene operating agency, but they said they had no stock, because "for several months, our public kerosene has been piled up in Lingbao, unable to find military wagons to transport it!" However, at the same time, the kerosene transported eastward by "merchants" through the railway bureau was continuously arriving in the market, with no real shortage. For such things, the reason is obvious?</p>
<p>On December 2nd, the director of the Longhai Railway Bureau was replaced by Mo Heng, who was transferred from Nanjing. People in the transportation industry seem to have high expectations for him. This new director inspected the line from Xuzhou to Xi'an. His first "diagnosis" was that the Longhai Railway was "born with deficiencies and acquired maladjustments." Based on this "diagnosis," we might as well let "time" test what the "prescription" will be tomorrow. However, in the few days before the new takeover, the railway schedule was considerably delayed. Some people say that this is a common phenomenon when "the baton is being passed." But to outsiders, it seems to be throwing a thorn at the "personnel system" of the railway, which has always been known as one of the three major systems along with the postal service and customs!</p>
<p>According to Mo's statement, "The Zhongmou section can be rushed to completion before the end of this year. In this way, train services can be increased west of Zhengzhou. Passenger and freight transportation west of Zhengzhou is expected to improve within three months, get on track in six months, and return to normal in one year." Given the length of the railway line in that section and the perfunctory nature of the current construction, if it can be normalized in one year, it will certainly be a major event in railway restoration.</p>
<p>"However," Mo made the following "proviso": "The supply of materials still needs to be resolved, because the source is either from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or purchased by the government using credit loans. However, the former does not want to provide relief to the Longhai Railway because it is close to the war zone, and the latter, the purchase and transportation are not immediately feasible. Moreover, it is now deep winter, and all construction work must wait until next spring to begin. At present, we can only store materials..." The reporter records the above as it is, in order to verify it with the facts in three months, six months, and one year.</p>
<p>Looking further west from Lingbao, the Lintian (Shuishui) Railway, which was hastily started during the war and perfunctorily completed and "reported" after the war, is still not open to traffic. Statistics show that since the beginning of this year, the number of days that traffic was disrupted due to landslides has clearly exceeded the number of days that traffic was barely possible. (Since the major collapse this autumn, although active repairs have been carried out, it was originally planned to complete the work in early winter to facilitate the travel of merchants during the Lunar New Year. But judging from the situation, this possibility is extremely slim. If it cannot be repaired by the end of this month, it will be impossible to start due to ice and snow. What if we wait until the snow melts and the ice thaws next spring? That's even worse, because the increase in rainfall and the non-compliant slopes and roadbeds will only increase the number of collapses!</p>
<p>Looking further west, the preliminary work on the "Tianshui-Lanzhou" section has been done over the past few months using the "work-for-relief" method, but recently, due to the weather, the sky is covered with ice and snow, making it impossible to start work. We have to wait until the spring when the weather is warm and the flowers bloom to resume work. It is said that next year we will continue to use "work-for-relief" to recruit laborers. It is expected that it will take three years to complete the project in the most favorable circumstances.</p>
<p>Looking back east to the section from Xuzhou to Haizhou, it is said that track restoration has also begun. The details are not within the scope of this reporter's coverage, so they are omitted here.</p>
<h3>Japanese Land Reform</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhang Deqian from The Christian Science Monitor</p>
<p>The Japanese government's plan to break the feudal agricultural system, approved by the Allied Supreme Commander, has been initially decided to be announced. Most non-Japanese experts believe that this plan lacks the spirit of democratic reform and is insufficient as a means to break one of Japan's most undemocratic economic systems.</p>
<p>According to Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Wada's explanation to reporters, this new land reform bill is a kind of land economic revolution, the purpose of which is to eradicate the original autocratic system, because Japanese farmers have always been subjected to ruthless exploitation and forced to sell their labor cheaply, and used by urban industrialists. Therefore, it is proposed to divide large estates, assisted by the government, and resell them to small tenant farmers who have been enslaved by tyrannical landlords for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Regarding this new bill, MacArthur expressed his opinion: "I am satisfied with the courage and determination shown by the current government to eradicate the ancient landlord system." MacArthur replied in a letter that the bill "will eliminate the pests of communism from the Japanese soil."</p>
<p>In fact, this new bill is only a redistribution of land. At least on paper), but according to qualified land experts here, the bill has many loopholes, and Japanese officials can arbitrarily reduce its original purpose of reform.</p>
<p>One expert here described the bill as "like building a fence to protect grain, to prevent wild rabbits, but only covering three sides."</p>
<p>In essence, the purpose of the land reform bill drafted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry this time is to give tenants the opportunity to obtain four-fifths of the country's arable land. For example, if the bill can be fully implemented, more than 500 acres of the 650 acres of land currently cultivated by tenants will be owned by the tenants. At that time, only about one-tenth of all arable land in Japan will be tenanted land.</p>
<p>The Japanese government will purchase land from landlords at a price of 757 yen per dan (Japanese system: each dan is equal to one-fifth of an acre), and resell it to future owners with long-term loans. The former tenant farmers will pay about one-third of their annual harvest to the government for a period of 30 years, roughly equal to the land rent they should pay in peacetime.</p>
<p>The main loophole in the bill seems to be that it does not specify the amount of land that each family is allowed to own, nor does it specify the amount of land that tenants or "others" are allowed to purchase.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, when MacArthur submitted the land reform issue to the United Nations Control Commission for Japan, the committee unanimously recommended that the land owned by any person should be limited to seven and a half acres, and that any excess should be redistributed and sold to other small landlords, so as to prevent rich farmers from taking the opportunity to purchase more land and hire workers to cultivate it.</p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Wada frankly told reporters yesterday that this plan "will not be implemented, whether now or in the future." He declared with great certainty that as long as farmers agree to cultivate the land themselves, the new bill does not prohibit them from buying large tracts of land.</p>
<p>The new bill also stipulates that self-cultivating farmers who own more than seven and a half acres of land do not need to sell their excess as long as they cultivate it properly. This clause is particularly biased towards large tracts of poorly cultivated land, because this kind of land is actually better distributed to small farmers who are in urgent need of land.</p>
<p>There is another loophole, that is, according to the provisions of the bill, the implementation of the land reform plan must be carried out mainly by the local committees, which are organized by an equal number of tenants and landlords.</p>
<p>If the current Japanese leaders really want to implement democratic reforms, this matter can be realized. But the current administrative authorities have a tendency to maintain the old system with all their strength, so the achievements of the committee will inevitably be difficult to meet expectations. Because Japanese tenants have been subjected to the tyranny of landlords for a long time, once they are asked to discuss matters together with the landlords, they will inevitably follow the landlords' lead. Even when things that cannot be resolved need to be transferred to the prefectural governor for handling, the prefectural governors are mostly backed by landlords, so they will still be detrimental to the tenants.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese government's estimate, when the entire reform plan is implemented, only 700 of the current 37 million tenant farmers will remain tenant farmers. However, according to Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Wada's statement to reporters yesterday, the government has not yet set up a separate budget agency for the plan, so there is no budget available at present. Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Wada also declared that the Japanese government will follow the provisions of the Allied Supreme Commander to complete the plan within two years, because MacArthur had endorsed the end of the bill, limiting the bill to be completed within two years.</p>
<p>According to Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Wada, there is no time limit in the original text of the bill, and its implementation depends on whether the local committees can abide by the original purpose of the bill. Therefore, the biggest weakness of the bill is that although there is a method of democratic land reform, it does not contain compulsion. Whether it can be realized depends on whether Japanese officials are faithful or not, and it is no different from other democratic reform bills that are just paper tigers. In fact, according to the feelings of most observers here, whether Japanese officials are faithful at present is still quite problematic.</p>

<h3>Masked Bandits Rob Steamship; A Word Provokes Fury, Soldier Shot</h3>
<p>As the year enters winter, the security situation in Jiangxi Province is becoming increasingly serious. Not only do people feel uneasy when walking alone, but cars are also attacked when they break down. A two-amphibious jeep, after crossing Zhanggongdu, was also patronized by bandits. Then, two steamboats were robbed in the same area, on the Sanjiadian River, 15 miles from the outskirts of Nanchang. The silver and goods from the ship's accounting office, as well as the passengers' luggage, were all tied up and carried away by masked and disguised bandits, leaving no trace. A soldier of unknown name on the "Xin Yunsheng" steamer, seeing the bandits speaking with a provincial accent rampaging and robbing, said, "Comrades! Why do you have to do this?" These words provoked their anger, and he was shot dead. His body was pushed into the river, and another shot was fired.</p>
<p>Traveling in Jiangxi now really feels like "traveling is difficult." Chairman Wang Lingji traveled from Nanchang to Jiujiang and then to Nanjing one day. For the sake of security along the way, a large contingent of guards escorted him. This was not Yu Shi's ostentatious display of power, but mostly a practical necessity.</p>
<h3>Xinyu County Station Master Commits Suicide Due to Grain Shortage?</h3>
<p>Jiangxi's actual grain collection this year has been underway since November. According to information from the Grain and Food Office, the amount collected by various counties and reported to the province totals 180,000 shi. Taihe and other counties have achieved better results. According to this proportion, it is possible to collect enough grain by the end of this year. It was previously rumored that the head of the Xinyu County Grain Transport Station committed suicide, reportedly because he owed too much grain (40,000 shi) and tried to hide in this way to shirk responsibility.</p>
<h3>Taichung Travels</h3>
<p>— December 1st, Taipei Air Mail, Special Correspondent for Taiwan, Yang Yu</p>
<p>For someone arriving from within the country, Taipei City, as the political and economic center of Taiwan, seems to offer sufficient spiritual satisfaction. However, if you venture out from here and explore every corner of the verdant island, I dare say your heart will be filled with even newer things. On the morning of the 27th, I packed a simple bag and boarded a train heading towards the western plains of the solid island, embarking on a short trip to Taichung.</p>
<p>Coastal Scenery, Deep Azure</p>
<p>The coastal railway stretches westward, parallel to the Taiwan Strait. Sometimes they are far apart, and sometimes they embrace each other. White sand, green pines, and blue waters peek shyly through the train windows. I especially love the large streams filled with sparkling pebbles, slowly flowing towards the vast, misty sea from under the high bridges, tens of meters away from the train. A stone, a blade of grass, a tree – here, they all become poetic embellishments. It's already December, but the warm, gentle spring breeze still caresses you.</p>
<p>The wide streams, such as Dakekan Creek, Dadu Creek, Dajia Creek, and Dagai Creek, drain westward from the towering mountains, creating a fertile western plain rich in rice and sugarcane. Although the current is not rapid now, and some even clearly show dried riverbeds, a heavy rain can cause the water to surge rapidly, like thousands of troops galloping and flooding everywhere. To prevent such disasters, many riverbanks are protected by concrete retaining walls. Chief Chen has recently emphasized afforestation. To truly protect the fertile western plains and reclaim barren land, a permanent and large-scale protective forest should be established in the upper reaches of the streams. Simply relying on retaining walls is not enough.</p>
<p>The coastal railway runs directly from Taipei to Tainan and Kaohsiung. To reach Taichung, you need to change trains at Changhua. Although the journey into the Taichung Basin is only a short half hour, the deep azure coastal scenery transforms into the green of vegetables and the yellow of rice paddies, a rural landscape.</p>
<p>Cultural City, Infinite Tranquility</p>
<p>From the gate of the station, I began to encounter Taichung City, the sixth largest city in Taiwan, known as "Little Kyoto" and a "Japanese-style model city," bringing a sense of infinite tranquility. It has always maintained its leisurely demeanor. The railway line divides it into two parts: the industrial area to the east and the bustling city area between the Luchuan and Liuchuan Rivers to the west. In fact, it is incredibly quiet. On the glossy asphalt roads, only the sparse sounds of footsteps can be heard. Tropical palm trees sway in the breeze, carrying a refreshing fragrance. In the past, everyone called this a cultural city. Indeed, there are many well-established primary and secondary schools, and dozens of public and private libraries... but what about now? Take bookstores, for example. A man who has lived in Taichung for twenty-one years opened a large Lixing Bookstore, but it only has twenty or thirty books of poor quality. Other bookstores, such as Central Bookstore and Cultural Bookstore, also fail to offer any worthwhile books, unless you search in second-hand bookstores. Although the war brought misfortune to this cultural capital, the damage was relatively light. The magnificent primary and secondary schools are already filled with the sounds of the national anthem every morning. "Thunderstorm" is being staged here, and Lin Henian's concert has attracted many listeners. The revival of the cultural capital seems to have begun. In such a beautiful environment, I hope everyone will spread the new seeds of culture as much as possible!</p>
<p>Walking the streets at night, the once bustling "Rongcho" and "Jincho" have been renamed Zhongshan Road, Zhongzheng Road, and Ziyou Road. Although the shops are brightly lit, the number of customers is pitiful. Sitting in the "Red Wing Tea Room," under the dim light reflecting on the potted plants, listening to a segment of "The Blue Danube," this kind of sentiment makes me feel an extraordinary love and longing for this cultural capital!</p>
<p>The Scent of Wine Everywhere, Drooling</p>
<p>There are a total of thirty-four state-owned wineries under the Monopoly Bureau throughout Taiwan, distributed in Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taitung, Chiayi, and Hualien Harbor. The largest is the Banqiao Winery in Taipei, followed by one next to Fuxing Road on the east side of the Taichung Railway. I took some time to visit it once. In the past, the Taichung Monopoly Bureau and the winery were combined, but they were separated in August of this year. The Monopoly Bureau is responsible for the distribution of monopoly goods, while the winery focuses on production and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Section Chief Chen of the winery first led the reporter to the workshop where "Bailu Wine" is made. The factory, established more than twenty years ago, looks very old from the outside. Moreover, the war did not spare it, as a bomb was dropped next to it. After the retrocession, it was repaired and put into operation for a period of time. However, it has now been shut down again due to damage. "Bailu Wine" is commonly called rice wine. The raw material is rice, with added sugar or honey for fermentation. In the fermentation room, there are fourteen large iron vats. After the rice and sugar are placed inside for more than ten days of fermentation, countless iron pipes carry the initially brewed wine to the distillation room for rigorous distillation. Because there are many impurities mixed in, the distilled wine is then transferred to a copper-colored boiler for filtration. After these steps, the rice wine is made, and then it flows from the pipes into large vats in the warehouse for storage. It can be transferred to the packaging room for bottling at any time. Because the production method relies mostly on machinery, not many workers are employed. In total, there are about two hundred people in the entire winery. The alcohol content of rice wine is 22%, which may be a bit strong for the average person. Although this part of the factory has been shut down for a long time, after turning around a few times inside, I could smell the pungent aroma of wine everywhere. Those old drunkards who believe "one cup in hand, all worries are gone" would undoubtedly drool here.</p>
<p>Currently, they are manufacturing "Fragrant Wine," which contains 17% alcohol. The process is a bit more complicated. Although the raw material is also rice, it must be carefully selected and whitened. It is first soaked in water and then taken out to make koji. Then it is fermented in many large iron vats. After that, the specially stored alcohol is piped into it. In this way, the wine can be made after only eight or nine days. However, because the purity of the alcohol is very low, there is a risk of bacteria and spoilage. Therefore, after the initial production, it is filtered and then passed through a boiling water furnace with a very high temperature to kill the bacteria before being transferred to the storage room. However, once it reaches the large vats in the storage room, it must stay there for two months before it can be taken out for bottling.</p>
<p>Daily Wine Production, Two Hundred Metric Tons</p>
<p>The bottling room is filled with the roar of machines, and the clanging of bottles is deafening. At one end of the machine, a female worker places rows of empty bottles on the racks. They are rolled into the machine layer by layer and take several baths in cold and hot water. When they come out from the other end, they are still neatly arranged. Then they mechanically move forward, passing a female worker who specializes in inspecting the bottles. Then, one by one, they are guided onto a filling machine, filled, and then moved to another capping machine to be capped. At this time, many female workers put them into a large machine and take another steam bath. You might think this is the last sterilization and disinfection, right? Actually, no. After they come out dripping wet, they must go through another female worker who uses an electric light to carefully check them for cracks and impurities before the labels are applied manually and they are packaged. It is said that in the past, labeling and packaging were also done by machines.</p>
<p>With such high-speed production, two hundred metric tons of finished products can be produced every day, which can fill twelve thousand bottles of wine. However, sales have not been as good as in the past, because many people do not fully understand the nature of the monopoly business, resulting in the prevalence of illegal wine, which has become a major obstacle. In the past, when the Japanese ruled Taiwan, 79% of the fiscal revenue relied on the monopoly business, but now we are lamenting the difficulties of the monopoly business. The difference is immeasurable. Where do we even begin?</p>
<h3>Brick and Tile Industry in Jiangnan</h3>
<p>— Sixth Dispatch, Special Correspondent for Hangzhou, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line, the great artery of Jiangnan, is indeed worthy of being called abundant. However, it only has achievements in agriculture, while its industry appears very fragile. Besides the silk factories in Chang'an and Jiaxing, the weaving and sock factories in Xiashi, the silk screen factories in Hangzhou, the paper factory in Jiaxing, and the brick and tile industry in Jiashan, there is simply nothing else to introduce. After the victory of the War of Resistance, this fragile industry not only did not recover but also appeared even more desolate and declining. There is no way to export silk, and domestic sales are also difficult. The same is true for cloth, socks, and paper. Moreover, a large number of foreign goods are sold in the Chinese market, bringing this small, vulnerable industry on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to a serious crisis.</p>
<p>However, the brick and tile industry seems to be able to raise its head at this time, because the widespread destruction in the country urgently needs construction, and the housing shortage everywhere urgently needs the construction of residences. Moreover, foreigners are definitely unwilling to transport bricks to China for sale, because bricks and tiles are bulky, which is very uneconomical in principle.</p>
<p>Seven Kiln Areas</p>
<p>The production of bricks and tiles in Jiashan began during the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty. By the late Qing Dynasty, with the opening of the Shanghai and Hangzhou concessions, the demand for bricks and tiles increased dramatically. Around the tenth year of the Republic, there were company organizations. By the twentieth year, fifteen brick and tile companies had been established in the county. At that time, the transportation and sale of bricks and tiles spread throughout Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, making it the center of the Jiangnan brick and tile industry. The Jiashan market also prospered considerably.</p>
<p>The county can be divided into seven kiln areas. At its peak, there were more than seven hundred kilns in operation, and farmers engaged in brickmaking as a side business accounted for more than 80%. The kiln areas are Yuhai, Fanjing, Xiadianmiao, Tianrenzhuang, Hongjiatan, Qingliang'an, and Qianyao. All seven of these areas have small ports for transportation. Boats travel from morning to noon. Later, motorized boats converted from rowing boats began to operate, making transportation convenient. There are about seven hundred and fifty kiln owners, one hundred and twenty-five brick traders, and brickmakers account for about 80% of the population in the kiln areas. Brick and tile blanks are mostly made by local farmers. The source of brick clay is Lunan in Jiashan and the southern countryside of Jiaxing, as well as Luxu in Wujiang, Jiangsu. The types and quality of bricks and tiles produced in these seven kiln areas are different, so their sales areas are also different. For example, Yuhai produces No. 2 bricks, Dingsheng, and Huangdao, which are sold in Suzhou and Jiaxing. Fanjing produces No. 3 bricks, Huangdao, and paving bricks, which are sold in Pudong, Shanghai. Xiadianmiao produces No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 bricks, which are sold in Shanghai. Tianren produces No. 3 bricks, large and small tiles, and paving bricks, which are sold in Hangzhou and other ports in the interior. Hongxi produces No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 bricks, large and small tiles, and square bricks, of which 70% are sold in Shanghai and 30% in other ports in the interior. Qingliang'an produces No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 bricks, Dingsheng, and Huangdao, of which 80% are sold in Shanghai and 20% in other ports in the interior. Qianyao produces No. 3 bricks and flat tiles, which are sold in major cities and the surrounding countryside of the county.</p>
<p>Kiln Distribution</p>
<p>As for the distribution of kilns: Yuhai has eighty-three, Fanjing has sixty-five, Xiadianmiao has one hundred and twenty-four, Tianren has one hundred and twenty-one, Hongxi has two hundred and forty-five, Qingliang has thirty-three, and Qianyao has one hundred and fifty-six, for a total of eight hundred and twenty-seven. Before the war, almost none of these eight hundred and twenty-seven kilns were owned by brickmaking workers or kiln workers. They were all built by people with some money, who hired people to make bricks and operate the kilns during the farmers' off-season. These kiln workers did not consider it their main occupation but rather a source of side income. The work process is very simple: after the mud is brought in, it is put into a grid-shaped blank mold to make blanks, and then the blanks are carried to the place where they are fired. The kiln looks like a cemetery hill, with a chimney standing on top. The kiln workers put the blanks inside and burn them with straw and coal ash. During the firing process, water carriers constantly carry water and climb to the top of the kiln to pour water on the bricks below. The kiln workers have to enter the kiln to take out the fired bricks. In the heat of summer, some kiln workers would faint on the ground after coming out of the kiln because the temperature inside was too high. After the bricks are made, they are loaded onto boats and transported to the market for sale.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, because of the widespread war damage, many people who wanted to build houses were hesitant. At the same time, the instability of land and housing prices also made those with intentions hesitant to move forward. The countryside was devastated, and many people could not even cultivate their fields. Who would bother with the meager profits of brickmaking? As a result, many kilns stopped smoking, and the brick and tile industry was on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Improving the Kiln Industry</p>
<p>Based on what we have said above, we know that in the past, the kiln industry was in the hands of the kiln owners, and the workers who directly produced the bricks had no share. At this time when the brick and tile industry is on the verge of bankruptcy, we thought of a better way, which is to support the kiln workers in developing the kiln industry. Because bricks and tiles are transferred by brick traders and kiln owners, the cost has increased and exploitation has intensified. The kiln workers who directly produce the bricks and the engineers who directly build the houses are both subjected to unreasonable exploitation. We might as well bring the people in the construction industry and the brick and tile workers together to eliminate the middlemen's profits. People who are preparing to build can lend money to the kiln workers who produce the bricks, and the kiln workers can produce and supply the bricks to the people who are building. Wouldn't that be great? But this is closer to the ideal. In this complex society, there are more people who are eager for quick success and instant benefits than those who uphold justice for the public. If we want to do this, we must put politics on the right track and use the power of politics to support the kiln workers before there is a way. Otherwise, we ask the government to use relief materials and lend money directly to the kiln workers so that they can produce directly. If the kiln owners do not cooperate, the government can build new-style kilns and purchase machines from abroad to start firing kilns. I think this huge expense can be solved within the relief materials. This is true relief for the toiling masses, and truly revitalizing the brick and tile industry in Jiashan. Because the kiln owners' intermediate profits prevent the kiln workers from benefiting and make builders feel that the price of bricks and tiles is too high, which affects the construction industry, affects the kiln workers' work enthusiasm, and affects the improvement and development of the brick and tile industry.</p>
<p>Kiln Industry Organization</p>
<p>Now, some enlightened people in Jiashan are carrying out kiln industry organization and have begun to demand kiln industry loans. I think the appeal for kiln industry loans is appropriate, but the loans should be lent to the workers. During the War of Resistance, so many destroyed places need to be rebuilt. In a province like Zhejiang, there are also a large number of calls for building houses. If the brick and tile industry is exploited by middlemen and the cost is increased, it will be a huge threat to the millions of people who have no houses to live in. Do we still want to wait for foreign bricks and tiles to be transported to China to build houses on Chinese land in order to alleviate the Chinese housing shortage?

<h3>Random Notes from the "Liberated Area"</h3>
<p>A cadre in charge of struggle returned home at night and was picked up and thrown into a well. Because the well was small and the person was positioned horizontally, he did not sink to the bottom. The next day, several water carriers rescued him. It was obvious that this was a reflection of his struggle, but the cadres insisted that it was done by special agents. Thus, the "Serving the People" anti-espionage movement was launched, and the people there were arrested en masse. In these years of being arrested and released, it is unknown how many people died or were maimed. In the families of those arrested, it is unknown how many fled, were scattered, or were even "hit by guerrilla warfare" by those cadres (meaning men and women cohabiting). I personally saw two doctors named Ma being detained for a year and two months by those cadres for "not understanding." I also personally saw those cadres, as if joking, drag five people out to be shot. One of the young men wanted to speak, but the cadres used the butt of a gun to hit him hard on the head. In the instant that the red blood stained the black iron, the young man's head drooped, and his legs gave way. At this time, those cadres dragged him to their never-fixed execution ground like dragging a dead dog. These five people who were killed had not been subjected to a so-called public trial beforehand, nor had a single word been announced afterward. This kind of unexplained death is really too miserable! (Zhu Xiaotian)</p>

<h3>Yugoslavia's Dictator Tito: Opportunistic, Once Helped Tsarist Troops Fight the Red Army</h3>
<p>— Translated from the American Chronicle by Cassini</p>
<p>For millions of Serbians, Croatians, Slavs, and the vast masses outside the Iron Curtain, the name "Tito" is a symbol of terror, a madman worshiping communist ideals.</p>
<p>Tito launched a brutal campaign in the Balkans to sanctify communism and for political purposes. Although he suffered a bad reputation internationally because of this campaign, he has become the ruler of millions of innocent people under Stalin's support, a "obedient" puppet leader of the Kremlin.</p>
<p>If his master Stalin were to trace Tito's background—Tito's former name was J. Broz—a former leader of the White Russian anti-communists—then Tito's face would be as red as the flag he is holding high and the "bloody hands" he used to kill people.</p>
<p>Originally Anti-Communist</p>
<p>No matter how Tito—Broz—boasts of his pure communist background, he was not born speaking Russian. He is a Croatian Catholic—and still a Catholic—who was an anti-communist when he first emerged. His father and mother were God-fearing Croatian farmers. If they were still alive to see Tito's great achievements in killing people, they would scold him and drown him.</p>
<p>Changed His Name Three Times</p>
<p>Tito wants to put a period of his life from 1915 to 1920 behind him, because during this period he participated in the Austro-Hungarian army on the Soviet-Russian front to resist revolutionary troops. In 1915, he was captured and sent to Siberia. According to his own account, he was indeed captured, but some say he defected to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>At that time, the Tsar was persuading the Slavs to rebel against the central government and organized South Czech volunteer troops to help the Imperial Russian army fight. However, Tito only recently denied to an American journalist that he had ever participated in the South Slavic army.</p>
<p>General Graves, the leader of the American Expeditionary Force in Siberia, wrote a book. In this book, there is a photograph with several French, American, British, and Japanese officers, as well as a Major Broz (i.e., Tito) wearing the uniform of the White Russian army. This book proves that Tito's loyalty to the Communist Party is impossible.</p>
<p>What Tito did from 1915 to 1920 cannot be told. However, during this period, the historian Alexander Tai Shanzi, in his book "Tsars and Presidents," which describes the relationship between the United States and Russia from 1777 to 1917, has the following description:</p>
<p>When the March Revolution broke out in 1917, Broz (i.e., Tito) was still far away in Siberia. When Austria collapsed in November 1918, Tito was in the South Slavic army, an officer in the anti-communist home of General Kolchak. After the collapse of General Kolchak's rule, Tito defected to the Red Army. This time Tito's transformation was no different from his previous defection from Austria to the Tsar.</p>
<p>In the above photograph (which is still in our hands), Tito has a Chaplin-style mustache, and his hair has temporarily fallen out due to typhus, but his face is still the same as it is now. Tito emphatically denied the fact that he participated in the Spanish Civil War, but his friend at that time, Maier Nalux, said: Broz served as the political commissar of the Lukacs army (belonging to the International Army), at that time Tito's name was "Antonio."</p>
<p>Tito's entire career seems to have benefited from changing his name, beliefs, and doctrines. Finally, he went from a completely pure clergyman to Yugoslavia and was expelled from the church.</p>
<p>Now communism is powerful, but who knows what new ideas tomorrow will bring, causing Tito, Broz, Antonio, plus a new name, to seek the protection of the church and deal a serious blow to Stalin?</p>
<p>The Changeable Tito</p>
<p>Having changed his name twice, first a clergyman, then joined the anti-communist army, now pro-communist, the diagram shows Tito wearing the uniform of the anti-communist army in 1918, planning how to destroy the communist army.</p>

<h3>Southwest Africa</h3>
<p>— Zuo Qi</p>
<p>At the Second General Assembly of the United Nations, the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, Smuts, proposed the annexation of Southwest Africa, which was opposed by China, the Soviet Union, and several Eastern European countries.</p>
<p>South West Africa borders the Union of South Africa to the south, Portuguese West Africa to the north, the British Bechuanaland Protectorate to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, with an area of approximately 835,000 square kilometers. When various European powers explored Africa in the mid-19th century, this area was designated as a sphere of influence by Germany. At the Berlin Conference in 1884, it was agreed to be a German protectorate. It was occupied by the Union of South Africa army in 1915 during the European War. After the European War, it was entrusted to the Union of South Africa for trusteeship. (Walvis Bay on the Atlantic coast of Southwest Africa, and the surrounding area of more than 1,100 square kilometers, has belonged to Great Britain since 1878 and is managed by South Africa.)</p>
<p>The interior of Southwest Africa is dry land, suitable for livestock raising. Cereals are produced along the coast. In recent years, diamond and copper mines have been discovered in the territory. The capital, Windhoek, has a thriving livestock industry, and the railway extends to the coast.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Actively Promotes Pacific Base Plan</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xi from the New York Times</p>
<p>The issue of American bases in the Pacific has now become a major key to the future of the United Nations. World attention is focused on this, and it is also a major difficulty for the future "peace treaty with Japan," which is extremely closely related to our country. This article is a special commentary from the New York Times, and is translated here.</p>
<p>U.S. President Truman's proposal to place the Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific under the trusteeship of the United Nations, with the United States as the sole administrative authority, has broad implications for the United Nations and the U.S. relationship with other powers.</p>
<p>The islands involved in this proposal include three major categories: the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, and the Marshall Islands. However, in addition to the former Japanese mandated territories, there is another category of Pacific islands, such as Okinawa and Iwo Jima, which are Japanese territories that may become important American military outposts. Therefore, whenever the United States discusses strategic bases in the Pacific, it inevitably involves these islands.</p>
<p>The mandated areas that the United States proposes to place under conditional trusteeship were originally German territory, and were entrusted to Japan by the League of Nations after World War I. However, Japan violated the terms of the mandate and established powerful defensive bases in that million-square-mile area.</p>
<p>Pacific Security</p>
<p>Now, in order to safeguard its position in the Pacific, the United States has driven Japan out of these fortresses. The United States is unwilling to give up these islands easily without obtaining guarantees that they can be used as military bases. Not only that, although the U.S. government has begun to discuss the trusteeship issue internally, the Navy Department has already selected locations that can be used as bases and is proceeding with plans to build them. Construction work on Guam is actively underway, and the breakwater being built in Apra Harbor is nearing completion, costing millions of dollars. At the same time, the deployment of naval, land, and air forces is being arranged.</p>
<p>Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, recently announced a grand plan to build Guam into a base as important, or even as large, as Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor is 4,000 miles east of Guam, and the two major bases face each other from a distance, controlling the entire Pacific. However, according to the Navy Department, Guam should not be an isolated American outpost as it was in the past, but the core of a vast fortress network, with the Aleutian Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, American Samoa, the Palau Islands, the westernmost Caroline Islands, and Okinawa and Iwo Jima as its outer sentinels. Uleithi Island in the Palau Islands has been used as a fleet anchorage since it was recaptured by the U.S. Navy. Truk Island in the Caroline Islands was originally a Japanese naval fortress and was later used for the same purpose by the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>U.S. military leaders and government authorities have given lengthy consideration to the possibility that the United States will lose control of strategic bases after the Pacific mandated territories are placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations. As a result, they believe that the United States should not only incorporate the Japanese mandated territories, but also retain Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands, Iwo Jima in the Ogasawara Islands, and other islands deemed necessary for security.</p>
<p>Strategic Area Trusteeship</p>
<p>The U.S. proposal is based on the provisions of the United Nations Charter, which allows countries to establish "strategic area" trusteeships under the Security Council rather than the Trusteeship Council. Article 83 of the United Nations Charter stipulates: "All functions of the United Nations relating to strategic areas, including the approval of the terms of the trusteeship agreement and their alteration or amendment, shall be exercised by the Security Council."</p>
<p>After establishing this jurisdiction, the article also allows the Trusteeship Council to exercise very limited powers in strategic areas and authorizes the Security Council to consult the Trusteeship Council on political, economic, social, and educational matters within strategic areas. However, this action by the Security Council shall be subject to the terms of the trusteeship agreement; that is, the United States, as the initiator of the agreement, has the final say in this matter.</p>
<p>Blocking Base Areas</p>
<p>According to the U.S. plan, the United States has the right to refuse the Trusteeship Council access to the "blocked base areas" within the trust territory. This can be regarded as an American military base, and sometimes as the entire trust territory. The trusteeship agreements proposed by the U.S. State Department and other trusteeship proposals, such as those proposed by the United Kingdom and France regarding certain territories in East Africa, differ in this aspect. The introduction of the "Strategic Area Agreement" to the United Nations began with this U.S. plan.</p>
<p>This plan preserves the special rights of the United States in the blocked areas, which, in the eyes of Americans, is sufficient to guarantee the security of the United States in key areas of the Pacific. However, there will certainly be objections in the Security Council. It must be known that the passage of a proposal in that council requires unanimous consent.</p>
<p>First, some may raise the question: Is the United States asking for nominal trusteeship, or actual annexation? In terms of the content of the U.S. proposal, the United States is in the position of the administrative authority, holding "full administrative, legislative, and judicial powers," and the administered territory becomes part of the United States. However, the U.S. State Department explains that the rigid wording in the agreement is only used to illustrate the special terminology of American administrative power.</p>
<p>Second, there may also be objections to the U.S. proposal to prohibit foreign aircraft from flying over the trust territory, except as specifically agreed.</p>
<p>Focus of Controversy</p>
<p>However, the biggest reaction is likely to be to the provision on blocked base defense areas. Taking the Soviet Union as an example, even if it is not surprised by this part of the proposal, it can almost be certain that it will never agree to it. The Soviet Union has always been very concerned about the U.S. position in the Pacific, and it is feared that it will be difficult to tolerate the U.S. plan to establish secret fortresses within bombing range of the Soviet border. The Soviet Union will regard the U.S. proposal for the mandated islands as the fate determined by President Truman for any Japanese islands to be managed by the United States after World War II.</p>
<p>The ultimate fate of these islands depends on the resolutions of the peace conference. So far, the United States has not made any demands. A U.S. Navy Department spokesman insisted that these islands are of great importance to security. Those who agree with this view argue that Okinawa and Iwo Jima, which the United States sacrificed countless lives to obtain, should be "incorporated" into the United States.</p>
<p>The United Nations is very clear about the substantial interests of the United States in these Japanese islands and will certainly not forget this when discussing the U.S. trusteeship agreement in the future.</p>

<h3>International Progress: Post-War Cooperation Among the Powers Still Possible</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>In this week, the international atmosphere has once again been filled with compromise. After lengthy discussions on the issue of arms reduction, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly put forward compromise solutions. Finally, the opinions of the five major powers, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, have gradually converged. The only remaining issue is the veto power, with the Soviet Union still insisting on the principle of unanimity among the five powers and refusing to budge. In addition, the various countries have different methods for restricting the exercise of the veto power by the five powers, so it is still a major issue in the international arena.</p>
<p>However, the Council of Foreign Ministers, after several meetings, has achieved significant results. The foreign ministers of the four countries have reached a complete agreement on the draft peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, which were passed by the Paris Peace Conference. Not only have French officials expressed satisfaction with this, but also the Soviet political commentator Zhukov published an article in "Pravda" praising it, saying, "Judging from the success of the Council of Foreign Ministers, it can be seen that the four powers working together is still possible." However, the Council of Foreign Ministers did not thoroughly discuss the German issue because France insisted that it should not be discussed before Foreign Minister Bidault arrived in New York. Therefore, the last meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers is scheduled to be held on the 21st of this month, and it is feared that it will still not be able to discuss it.</p>
<p>Merger of Two Occupation Zones</p>
<p>Although the Council of Foreign Ministers has not been able to discuss the German issue, the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones was signed in New York by the foreign ministers of the two countries and will be implemented from January 1 next year. The contents of this agreement can be summarized as follows: (1) The common goal is to enable Germany to become self-sufficient by 1949; (2) The import and export trade of the two occupation zones after the merger will be resolved by the Joint Anglo-American Committee; (3) To raise the living standards of the residents in the two occupation zones, especially to increase the amount of food rations; (4) If the import and export trade cannot be balanced, the amount of the import surplus will be borne equally by the two countries.</p>
<p>Although this agreement is limited to the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the intentions of Foreign Minister Bevin and Secretary of State Byrnes, it is hoped that France and the Soviet Union can also participate. However, France believes that this agreement is purely technical in nature and has not solved the entire issue, so it refuses to participate and declares that France's position on Germany remains unchanged. As for the Soviet Union, it remains silent. Therefore, the solution to the German issue can only be hoped for when the Council of Foreign Ministers is convened next year.</p>
<p>Rumors of an Anglo-American Alliance Grow Louder</p>
<p>The British Communist Party's Daily Worker suddenly reported that the United Kingdom and the United States are about to conclude a military alliance treaty. This news shocked the world. Although the British War Office denied it, the doubts in the hearts of the world have not been dispelled. Even Labour MP Zilliacus, in a speech at the Anglo-Soviet Association on the 8th, opposed the conclusion of an Anglo-American alliance. He said, "The negotiations currently being conducted by the United Kingdom and the United States will inevitably result in the establishment of an alliance to prepare for a third world war against the Soviet Union. This secret diplomacy is no different from the Anglo-French Entente that was established on the eve of the First World War." Afterwards, he appealed to the British Labour Cabinet to treat the United States and the Soviet Union equally and not to show any favoritism.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the rumors of an Anglo-American alliance are growing louder. We should not want this unfavorable rumor to become a reality. Because the current world is still at a crossroads, if the United Kingdom and the United States form an alliance to oppose the Soviet Union, then the post-war world being divided into "two worlds" will be unavoidable. And in the confrontation between the "two worlds," there can be no true peace.</p>
<h3>Heavy Workload Shortens Lifespan: Being President Is Not Easy</h3>
<p>— Translated by Lan</p>
<p>Here we reprint an interesting table from the statistical bulletin of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. We think that this table is worth reading for everyone.</p>
<p>This table records three facts about every U.S. president except Hoover and Truman: their age at the time of their inauguration, the life expectancy estimated at that time, and their actual age at the time of death.</p>
<p>Messrs. Hoover and Truman are still living well with us today, so the records for them are of course incomplete.</p>
<p>After looking at this table, we can know that being the president of the United States is a job that shortens one's life.</p>
<p>This table should be studied in three parts: (1) Those who took office before 1850 – from Washington to Fillmore; (2) Those who took office between 1850 and 1901 – from Fillmore to Theodore Roosevelt; (3) Presidents after Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>In the first group, the presidents from Washington to Tyler lived an average of 2.9 years longer than their estimated life expectancy.</p>
<p>In the second group, three presidents, Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley, were assassinated, and therefore cannot be included in the calculation. As for the rest, they were the opposite of the first group, living an average of 2.9 years shorter than their estimated life expectancy.</p>
<p>Finally, speaking of the presidents who have died in the 20th century, we find that, with the exception of Taft, their lifespans were all significantly shorter than the estimates made at the time of their inauguration, with an average difference of more than eight years.</p>
<p>Of course, as the statisticians at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company point out, "One cannot simply infer from these numbers that the position of president today shortens the life of the president from the date of inauguration, but these numbers do exist. Regardless of the reason, the fact is that presidents before 1850 lived longer than their estimated life expectancy at the time of their inauguration, presidents between 1850 and 1901 lived an average of 2.9 years shorter, and after 1901, they died an average of eight years earlier than their reasonably predicted life expectancy."</p>
<p>It is well known that the office of president is an incredibly arduous job, even for broad-minded and self-confident people like Harding and Roosevelt, and its onerousness is increasing day by day. All of this is sufficient to support a suggestion we have made before, that every presidential candidate should undergo a thorough physical examination before the election.</p>
<p>The purpose of doing this is to ensure, as far as possible, that the voters do not elect someone who is about to die, as they did when they thrice elected Roosevelt in 1944.</p>
<p>Or, going a step further, as has been repeatedly suggested, to amend the constitution to limit each president to only one six-year term. There is absolutely no possibility of re-election or re-election after a period of retirement.</p>
<p>The advantage of this one-term limit is that it allows each president to focus on working for the welfare of the entire people in the White House, without being distracted by political activities aimed at planning for re-election. In fact, every president is now doing this.</p>
<p>In any case, we believe that the table above strongly supports the belief that "the office of president is a killer." The next inference is that the president is only a position that can be held by a person who is healthy and energetic, and in addition, he should also have a reasonably long life expectancy.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>In the Ancient Castle of Combourg</h3>
<p>— Written by François-René de Chateaubriand, Translated by Dachun</p>
<p>In the Castle of Combourg, there lived four masters: the father, the mother, the elder sister, and myself. Our servants included these: a cook, a maid, two male servants, and a groundskeeper. In addition to these, there was also a hunting dog and two old mares, confined in a corner of the sheds.</p>
<p>My father would rise every day at four o’clock, even in winter. After rising, he would walk to the entrance of the tower stairs in the inner courtyard and call to wake his servants. At five o’clock, coffee would be brought to him. After breakfast, he would sit and work in his study until noon. My mother and sister would each take breakfast in their own rooms at eight in the morning. I had no fixed time; I would rise and take breakfast at no set time; I would pretend to study until noon; for most of the time, I would do nothing.</p>
<p>At half past eleven, the lunch bell was rung, but the meal was only served at noon. The main hall served two purposes, as a dining hall and as a living room. We ate lunch and dinner sitting on the east end of the hall, and after the meal, we moved to the other end - the west end, to sit in front of a large fireplace.</p>
<p>After we finished lunch, we would all remain there together until two o’clock. After two, when it was summer, my father’s pastimes were nothing more than fishing, inspecting the vegetable garden, or taking walks around the castle; in autumn and winter, he would go hunting. My mother, on the other hand, would go to the family chapel to recite scriptures, which would take several hours...</p>
<p>After my father left and my mother went to recite scriptures, my sister, Lucille, would lock herself in her room, and I would return to my little room, or wander aimlessly in the countryside.</p>
<p>At eight o’clock, the bell announced dinner. After dinner, on clear days, we would sit on the stone steps. My father would take his shotgun and shoot at the owls that emerged from the battlements at dusk. My mother, Lucille, and I would gaze at the sky, the forest, the last of the sunlight, and the emerging constellations. At ten o’clock, we would return indoors to sleep.</p>
<p>Autumn and winter evenings were spent in a different way. After finishing dinner, the four of us retreated from the dining table to near the fireplace. My mother would lie sighing on an old couch made of Siamese silk; in front of her was placed a one-legged round table, upon which a candle was lit. Lucille and I would sit by the fireplace. The servants would clear away the dishes and withdraw from the hall. My father would begin to pace back and forth until bedtime. He wore a white crepe dressing gown, almost a greatcoat, which enveloped him, and I could scarcely see him. His bald head was neatly covered with a large white brimless cap. He would leave the fireplace and walk in the hall, illuminated by that single candle. When he walked away, we could barely see him, hearing only the sound of his footsteps in the gloom; then, slowly, he would pace back into the light, gradually emerging from the darkness, like a ghost, dressed in a white gown, wearing a white cap, his long face pale. When he was at the other end of the hall, Lucille and I would speak a few words softly; when he drew near, we would stop. As he walked past us, he would ask: "What are you saying?" We would be choked with fear, not answering him; he would continue walking. During the rest of the evening, we would only hear the sound of his measured footsteps, my mother's sighs, and the wind.</p>
<p>When the castle clock struck ten, my father would stop, and when the hammer of the clock striking the clockwork stopped, it seemed as though his feet were also suspended. My father would feel for his watch, wind it, take a large candlestick with a large candle lit upon it, and go to the west wing (Note 1), then return, holding the candle, to his bedroom in the east wing. Lucille and I would stand in the place where he was sure to pass, to embrace him and wish him a good night's sleep. He would lower his dry and sunken cheeks, say nothing, and continue on his way, reaching the bottom of the stairs, we would hear him close the door behind him.</p>
<p>That mood that had been interrupted—Mother, Sister and I, when Father was present, were all turned into statues, was now restored. The most important thing was to break our restraints, to open our mouths and begin talking.</p>
<p>We would talk for a while, and I would summon the maid to escort my mother and sister to their rooms. Before I left, they would always ask me to look under the bed, in the fireplace, behind the door, on the stairs, in the passageway, and in the nearby corridors. Because this castle had many legends, of thieves and ghosts, which often occupied their minds. The residents believed that there was once a Count of Combourg, who had died three centuries ago, who for a time often appeared with a wooden leg. Some people had met him at the foot of the grand staircase of the keep. Sometimes, it was only his wooden leg and a black robe that came out for a walk. These legends would always come to my mother and sister's minds when they slept, and they would be half-dead with fear when they were in bed. I would inspect the place for them and then go to my small tower; the cook would go to sleep in the main building, and the male servants would descend to the dungeon where they lived.</p>
<p>The window of my small tower opened onto the inner courtyard. During the day, I could see the raised section of the opposite castle facade in the distance, where several Scolopendrium (Note 2) and a wild plum tree grew. Every summer, a few sand martins would cry as they flew into the holes in the walls; they were my only companions. At night, I could only see a small patch of sky and a few stars. When the moon shone and its light penetrated the rhomboid glass of the window, casting its image upon my bed, then I knew that it had set in the west. At that time, the owls would fly from that tower to this tower, passing and repassing between the moon and myself, the shadows of their wings dancing on my tapestries. I slept in the most desolate part of the wilderness. No sound of the wind would be lost to my ears. Sometimes, the wind seemed to be moving with light steps; sometimes, it made sounds of resentment, and suddenly my door would shake violently, and a roar would come from the dungeon. These sounds would stop for a moment, and then come again after a while.</p>
<p>At four o’clock in the morning, my father would call to his servants at the entrance to the centuries-old arched section, as if the voices of the last ghosts of the night. This sound seemed to me comparable to the harmony with which Montaigne's father would awaken his son (Note 3).</p>
<p>Note 1: The father's study was in the west wing, and his bedroom in the east wing.</p>
<p>Note 2: A fern plant that resembles a tongue.</p>
<p>Note 3: Montaigne's father would play music in the morning to wake his son.</p>
<p>Anecdotes of Writers</p>
<h3>Garshin</h3>
<p>— Gan Si</p>
<p>One day, the Russian writer Garshin went to visit a female student he knew. The female student was preparing for an exam, and Garshin said, "Please study hard, let me write something." The female student went to the next room, and Garshin took out his notebook and began to write. After a while, the female student, who was focused on preparing for the exam, was startled by the sound of sobbing - it turned out that Garshin was writing about the worries of the protagonist in the novel and began to cry.</p>
<h3>Farmhouse</h3>
<p>— Millet</p>
<p>Millet (J.F. Millet 1814-1875) was a famous painter of the Barbizon school. He came from a farming family, and his subjects were also taken from farm life. His representative works, "The Gleaners" and "The Angelus," have become world-famous works. His painting style is simple and natural, and he is a landmark representative writer in the French art world. It can be said that he began the movement of bringing art from the city to the countryside, and his influence on the emerging art movement was enormous.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 119</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>He Jian was still wearing that suit. As soon as he got off the train at Matsushima, he hired a taxi and drove straight to Tianmu Village, so as not to startle the passersby. When he arrived at the edge of the village, He Jian got out of the car and walked along the secluded path behind the mountain to Mrs. Xiaoyuan's residence. The scenery here was exactly the same as He Jian had seen six years ago, without any change. Besides the maid who opened the door, the first person to greet He Jian was Juzi; Mrs. Xiaoyuan's daughter, a twenty-six-year-old young widow.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Juzi exclaimed with surprise and joy, "Why didn't you send a letter first?" She wanted to say something else, but seeing the fatigue on He Jian's face, she swallowed all the words she wanted to say and wiped her tears with her sleeve.</p>
<p>Juzi can be said to be a typical Japanese woman, with a mind that is neither new nor old, just keeping up with the general society of Japan, moving at the same pace. She is not beautiful, but she is not repulsive; she finished junior normal school at the age of eighteen, studying kindergarten experimental education. After graduating, she worked as a kindergarten assistant teacher for two years, and then married an elementary school teacher, and soon became a widow. Because her brother was in Nagasaki, starting a family and career, leaving her old mother alone, too lonely, so she asked to return to her mother's home, to accompany her mother, one old and one young, two generations of widows, living together. He Jian was a few months older than her, she called He Jian "Yu Ge", and also called him "Comet Brother", because He Jian did not come often.</p>
<p>This time He Jian came suddenly, and dressed like this, of course, she was very surprised; and because she had experienced a small period of life's vicissitudes in these six years, once she saw this fraternal heterologous flesh and blood, of course, she could not avoid touching some parting sadness. Seeing that He Jian did not speak, she instinctively knew what He Jian needed. Within five minutes, she helped the maid to prepare what He Jian needed - a warm bath, a set of pajamas, a clean sleeping place. Before He Jian entered the bath, she only said softly, "Mom went to the city to buy something, she will be back in two or three hours." Common sense and reason made her do exactly what He Jian wanted.</p>
<p>It was after nine o'clock in the evening when He Jian woke up from his sleep, because he slept peacefully and comfortably, he felt that his spirit had completely recovered. He lay there without moving, the room was not very bright, only on the small table in the corner of the room, there was a low-intensity table lamp, the lamp had a delicate flower shade, and on top of it was covered with a layer of green gauze. This was He Jian's favorite arrangement in the old days. Along with this dim light, he saw several photos on the wall, one of which was taken when he graduated, riding on a tall white horse, wearing full armor. On the clothes rack in another corner of the room, hung his suit, top hat, and on the ground were his leather shoes; at a glance, he knew that the clothes had been cleaned up, and the shoes were also polished clean. This was to prevent He Jian from having anything else to do, and he could put them on as soon as he got up. On a small chair next to him, draped a kimono with a blue background and white dots, a waistband, and a pair of slippers on the ground.</p>
<p>It was extremely quiet! Only the sound of waves came from afar; however, if you did not listen carefully, this subtle, mournful sound of waves would not be heard.</p>
<p>He Jian put on the kimono and stood by the window, gazing at the silent night scene under the faint light reflected by the stars. These were exactly the same as six years ago, without any change: according to the old impression, like rereading a familiar book, he could still see the small tail of the mountain on the side, planted with tall and low black pine trees, and in the places with prominent hills and valleys, there were Japanese-style pavilions, recognizing a corner or half a face from the pine forest. At the foot of the mountain, a beach reflected the starlight, showing a dark silver color, which contrasted with the ink-like sea water in the distance, forming a kind of pale comparison. This kind of pale scenery, harmonized with He Jian's depressed mood, instead felt a kind of pleasant and sympathetic pleasure.</p>
<p>When people are in a state of emotional tension, the best way is to find a quiet place, relax the body and mind as much as possible, so that the tense emotions can naturally relax and gradually restore the balance of mind. However, in a state of emotional tension, at the same time feeling frustrated, disappointed, and even the plans do not go smoothly, the future is bleak, the terror of failure, on a mind, like a dark shadow, sweeps back and forth, causing you to go to despair, even suicide; at this time, the most effective and wonderful elixir is to throw yourself into the arms of your mother, or into the jade arms of your lover, or into the sympathy and understanding of your confidant, and try to tell them as much as possible, or let them use such a big warmth to comfort you. In this way, without much time, you can also restore the balance of body and mind.</p>
<h3>New Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Xi Xi</p>
<p>During the Jin and Song dynasties in China, a kind of folk literature emerged, compiling short essays with fresh and bizarre news and materials, such as Gan Bao's "In Search of the Supernatural" and Liu Jingshu's "Garden of Wonders." From this kind of book, we can see the philosophy of life of our nation, and the traces of historical development and transformation. Moreover, Chinese mythological stories almost all have a characteristic, that is, the reflection of social system and thought, which can also be said to be realistic. Try to look at Hong Mai's "Yi Jian Zhi" and Ji Yun's "Notes from the Cottage of Close Observation," what is the difference from reading a social history of the Song Dynasty and the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty?</p>
<p>Western stories, however, are more surreal, and many places are simply unbelievable, but they also contain very deep philosophies that are very thought-provoking.</p>
<p>About ten years ago, there was a woman in Germany who had not received higher education, but could speak a dialect. No one could tell which country it was from. Later, several professors who studied ancient literature studied it carefully and found out that it was the language of the Aramaic people in the Jewish era. Even though the nation is destroyed, the books still exist, so we can still know a thing or two, but no one can speak it. This woman can actually speak it fluently. Except for the Buddhist theory of reincarnation, that a person from the ancient Aramaic people came to be reborn, it is difficult to explain. This was what a deceased Jewish-German doctor, Dr. W61ff, told Nie Yuntai in Shanghai. This kind of thing has certainly happened in the West, but not so incredible. For example, in 1935, the World News Agency's correspondent in Brazil reported: In Sacramento, Brazil, there was a poor child named Almeida, who was only twelve years old. His parents were both ignorant. This child was born with a special talent, able to speak and write a special language that no one knew. He could also translate it into Portuguese without any grammatical errors. In fact, he had never learned Portuguese, which is very similar to this.</p>
<p>Recently, Bennett Cerf, a publisher in the United States who specializes in writing notes, recorded such a real event.</p>
<p>Two female teachers drove from the northeastern United States on a cross-country trip. One day, in the Kansas wilderness, it was late and the car broke down again. These two people did not know how to repair the machine, so what should they do? Fortunately, they found what seemed to be a two-story country house in the distance, so they stumbled to the door and gently knocked on the door. Who knew there was no response? They knew it was an empty house, and the door was not locked. These two people relied on the flashlights in their bags and found that the living room and dining room were still quite orderly, and the equipment was still good, but the entire house was covered with a layer of dust, indicating that it had been uninhabited for a long time. They picked up some firewood and lit the fireplace, found blankets, and lay down on the sofa to wait for dawn, thinking that they had found a great place. Late at night, one of them suddenly felt as if someone had entered the house and was awakened by it. The other one also jumped up at the same time without expecting it. Suddenly, the room was filled with cold, and they smelled a smell of sea water (this place is always thousands of miles away from the sea). Then they saw a young man floating in as if swimming, clearly wearing oilskin clothes and boots, and water droplets were still reflected on his hair. He walked to the fireplace, shivering, and knelt down. One of the women could not help but scream, and the man looked back and disappeared suddenly. Later, as the morning light gradually appeared, the two people were stunned and questioned each other. They clearly saw the same thing, it was definitely not a dream! Moreover, looking closely at the fireplace, there was actually a pile of salt water and a green seaweed. When they found the car repairman, they learned that the owner of this house was named Newton, who had been sailing to the East for almost two years without any news. Later, they also learned that this person was a sailor on the Robert B. Anthony cargo ship on April 14, 1937. Six weeks later, it sank in a storm near Greenland, and all the people on board were killed. As for the seaweed, experts confirmed that it was indeed a marine organism and often grew on corpses.</p>
<p>Cerf is in the United States, very similar to the ancient Chinese Qi Xie Zhi Guai, and his writings are very popular.</p>
<h3>Two Kinds of Literary Criticism</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Some opinions on literary criticism</p>
<p>There are many kinds of modern literary criticism, the important ones are Inductive Criticism and Judicial Criticism. The main points and mutual relationship are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Inductive criticism applies the inductive method in science, and explains the content of the work in detail with an objective attitude, so that the reader can judge its value. All the elements contained in the work, the critic should fully explain them. Inductive criticism can be divided into two types according to its inductive method: one is consistent with the work being criticized, the purpose is to carefully examine the work and sequentially describe its content, and then determine the value of the work. Moulton's "Shakespeare as a Dramatic Artist" is a representative of this kind of criticism. The other is not only to delve into the content of the work, but also to examine the relationship between the work and its surrounding environment, the purpose is to study the value of a certain work compared with other works at the same time, and determine the status of the work. Sainte-Beuve and Taine both take this attitude. The purpose of inductive criticism is mainly to penetrate the center of the work, analyze the meaning of the work and induce it into a formula, so it can also distinguish the qualities of power and beauty contained in the work, as well as what is temporary and what is permanent in the work. Inductive criticism also has a great attempt, which should be specially mentioned here: to explain the various artistic and moral principles that the writer intentionally or unintentionally is guided and dominated by.</p>
<p>Judicial criticism is a kind of criticism that directly gives a value judgment to the writer or the work. Critics judge the value of writers or works with fixed standards, and their attitude is like a judge, very arrogant. Critics evaluate the value of the work based on how well it conforms to the standard. Because judicial criticism focuses on value, it is also called Criticism of Values. Jeffrey, a British critic at the end of the nineteenth century, was known as the representative of this school. Judicial criticism is often limited by two conditions: (1) a judgment must be made after inductive criticism; (2) the critic must regard what is expressed in the judgment as his own feelings and thoughts, not the true appearance of the writer or the work.</p>
<p>Regarding these two kinds of criticism, each has its own claims. Inductive criticism and judicial criticism are exactly on two different sides. The former only needs to explain, unfold, and illuminate the content of the work, and thinks that the value is self-evident and does not need to be judged, while the latter only relies on the critic's own likes and dislikes to make a subjective judgment. Among the two, inductive criticism is naturally more objective. Sainte-Beuve said: "For those who have fully studied what I have written, they must regard me as an appropriate critic, and a critic who does not flatter any code." Therefore, when he criticizes a certain work, he must first study all the author's works, study his character, family, and all living environment. After careful research, he explains the characteristics of the work and the author. Sainte-Beuve is only the founder of scientific criticism, and Taine, the builder of scientific criticism, has a more precise method than Sainte-Beuve. Taine's criticism; starts from the three elements that constitute art—race, environment, and era—he believes that every artistic work is not isolated, it must be affected by his race and environment, social influence, and the spirit of the times. When criticizing any work and author, we must use these influences to explain the characteristics of the work and the author. This attitude is really very correct.</p>
<p>The method of inductive criticism is of course more objective and in line with scientific principles, but I think that literary criticism cannot only focus on one side of explanation or judgment. Because the function of literary criticism must include both criticism and judgment. In my opinion, correct literary criticism should be a comprehensive and concrete unification of explanation and judgment. However, because the procedure of explanation comes before judgment, explanation is more important than judgment. If the content is not recognized in detail first, the value cannot be judged. Therefore, inductive criticism is the foundation of all criticism. However, using only inductive criticism is not enough to exhaust the functions of literary criticism. Since literary works have their advantages and disadvantages, it is natural to judge the value of their merits. After we have deeply understood the content of a certain work or writer, we should proceed to evaluate its value, or re-evaluate the works that have been previously determined by the predecessors. In this case, we still have to use judicial criticism.</p>
<p>How do I explain the comprehensive and concrete unity of induction and judgment that I said? Ideal literary criticism, of course, cannot lack explanation, but it is not enough to just interpret the external form. The main thing is to use the method of analysis to make a concrete analysis of the work, and to lay out the content nakedly and frankly, which is not a good explanation. A good explanation should be analytical. A good literary work must have a three-dimensional and intricate content, and literary criticism is certainly not satisfied with a superficial explanation. If you don't use the method of analysis, how can you explain the complex and intricate work? As for judgment, it is indispensable for literary criticism, but it should also avoid personal prejudices as much as possible. You must completely abandon your own likes and dislikes, and not allow the slightest arbitrariness. In everything, take a purely objective attitude, do not have a self-righteous mentality, and base the relative judgment of the value of the work on the analysis of the content and the true components of the work's response to the objective society. In this way, you will naturally not be blinded by prejudice and personal emotional thoughts about the true value of the work.</p>
<p>The field of literary criticism in our country is very underdeveloped, even more backward than creation. Even if you occasionally see literary reviews and book reviews, they are at most limited to explanation, and accurate judgments are rarely seen. As for saying that this is an objective tendency, in order to avoid arbitrariness and prejudice, no judgment is made. It is better to say that this is due to the barrenness of literary criticism in our country. Critics have not yet trained a sharp eye and cultivated a superb appreciation ability, so correct judicial criticism has not been universally established. We do not need the harsh attitude of a judge announcing a verdict today, but we urgently need an objective and relative judgment of the value of the work.</p>

<h3>Sports Field</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The Jiangwan arsenal explosion destroyed half of this Far East's number one sports field. Thinking about the difficulty of reconstruction at present, winter goes and spring comes, where will the large-scale sports meeting be held next year and in the future? I am really saddened.</p>
<p>It was built with an investment of 1.5 million yuan in 1934. Today, in terms of 10,000 times, it would require 15 billion. What's more, the municipal government has thousands of things to be taken care of, and the people's livelihood is so dilapidated. Where does the manpower and financial resources come from?</p>
<p>The fate of the sports field is tragic enough. After its completion in the spring of 1935, it only held the Sixth National Games once on National Day of that year, displaying its power. Since then, it has not been used as a larger venue. In the past nine years, it has suffered from war and frost, which is very bleak. After the victory, it was not reorganized, but instead, military supplies were piled up haphazardly and used as warehouses, which is really like using Longjing tea as feed, wasting things! Now, it is simply an explosion, so that what was spared from the eight-year fall of the Battle of Shanghai has been destroyed in one fell swoop. What misfortune does the sports field can anticipate.</p>
<p>Now that things have come to this, how can we make up for it?</p>
<p>First, the municipal education authorities should quickly take it back:</p>
<p>Second, raise funds for repairs. (Whether this repair fee comes from compensation or from donations is decided by the organizers through consultation.)</p>
<p>This not only concerns the welfare of all Shanghai citizens! At this time, the Municipal Council should urge the municipal government to take active action without delay!</p>
<h3>Distribution and Relief: Like This, Like That</h3>
<p>— Wu Shuyu</p>
<p>Melton and Wool Blanket</p>
<p>Returning to my home, when I dragged my family through Changsha, Hunan from Chongqing, the Hunan branch of the Executive Yuan was distributing American food products; milk powder, canned meat, biscuits, etc., were rolling out of the warehouse of the distribution station, onto the road in front of the distribution station, and into the stalls and baskets of hawkers all over Changsha. At first, I thought that these things that foreigners eat were brought here to make a fortune, and they must not be very good; later, after trying them out with my friends, I realized that these distributed goods were not only cheap, but also of good quality. For example: 14-pound American bacon sells for only 12,000 yuan, and it tastes so good that our famous Hunan bacon has to give way; a 1 1/2 pound box of soda crackers or a 1 3/4 pound box of sweet crackers sells for only 1,000 yuan, which is so many times better than Jiu Ru Qi's soda crackers that sell for 5,000 yuan per catty; a 5-pound can of Golden Mountain milk powder costs 13,000 yuan, which is almost the same as the locally produced lotus root powder; in addition, there is also "ten-person provisions", which costs only 12,500 yuan, which includes cigarettes, candies, biscuits, and canned goods.</p>
<p>Seeing these good things with my eyes, and tasting these good things with my mouth, my wife said to me: "Let's buy some too"? I listened to her words with my ears, and the thought of these things made my mouth water, so I unhesitatingly agreed to her suggestion: "Okay! Let's buy them"! We bought: three 14-pound cans of American bacon, eight 1 1/2 pound boxes of soda crackers, four 1 3/4 pound boxes of sweet crackers, and two 5-pound cans of Golden Mountain milk powder. In addition, we also planned to buy "ten-person provisions", but because the goods were good and the price was low, it was difficult to buy. After entrusting them again and again, I found a friend who worked in the Hunan branch of the Executive Yuan. This friend initially said that it was "difficult to buy", but when I pressed him, he came up with an excuse: "Speaker Zhao of the Provincial Council entrusted our Director Yu to buy two copies of 'ten-person provisions' for him, and he hasn't been able to buy them yet"!</p>
<p>Thinking about what my friend said, although it was a bit exaggerated; but Hunan people have Hunan characteristics, maybe they won't take advantage of others like Shanghai people? Moreover, although I wanted the cigarettes, candies, and biscuits in the "ten-person provisions"; but, for a person who is used to eating chili peppers, when there is no proper way to settle the small amount of sweet meat cans, I had to temporarily give up.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Shanghai, the distribution offices here were distributing American all-wool army blankets and Melton wool fabrics. Thinking of the distributed goods in Changsha, I hurriedly registered and borrowed money to pay the fees; after paying the fees, within a few days, I saw a notice from the distribution office in the newspaper, saying that preferential treatment would be given to public teachers and employees, and the distribution price of Melton wool fabrics would be reduced from 30,700 yuan per yard to 25,500 yuan. Good! The market price of Melton wool fabrics has already fallen to 28,000 yuan, shouldn't the distribution goods for public teachers and employees be reduced a little? However, although that's the case, the gentlemen at the distribution office can adjust the price at any time according to the market decline. This quick and refreshing style should be set up a memorial tablet for them in the hearts of every public teacher and employee who benefits from it.</p>
<p>Later, I was not able to get these items that I had registered and paid for, because of personal matters I ran to Nanjing; when I came back from Nanjing again, the colleagues in the office told me: "The Melton wool fabrics have been received, but there is no news about the army blankets." I felt relieved and said, "It doesn't matter." But when they handed the fabrics to me, I looked closely: "Ah! How is this Melton wool fabrics"? At this time, I didn't dare to suspect that our office colleagues were engaging in corruption, but I still smiled and said what I thought in my heart.</p>
<p>"This is the kind of goods that the distribution office sent down." The office colleague replied.</p>
<p>"The Melton wool fabrics that are being sold in the market are not like this"! I said.</p>
<p>"The ones sold in the market are American goods, these are woven by Chinese themselves."</p>
<p>At this time, I was silent. On the one hand, I was regretting that I didn't ask the price clearly before registering and paying for the distributed goods when I returned to Shanghai this time; on the other hand, I was complaining to the gentlemen at the distribution office, since they are doing business as agents for manufacturers, why didn't they stipulate one more item in the distribution method, like selling rat poison: "If it is fake, we will replace it, and if it doesn't work, we will return the money"? However, when it comes to "returning the money", it is best to calculate the interest rate according to the reality of rising prices and the daily depreciation of the currency; otherwise, all these methods, in black and white, although they say that they are giving preferential treatment to public teachers and employees, in reality they are making the public teachers and employees not know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>In the end, I will take this opportunity to talk about the survival of the distribution system, and the expenses of staff and workers. Since it is an extra expenditure of public funds, then I hope that it can truly be beneficial and truly give preferential treatment to public teachers and employees, and not just waste public funds as agents for manufacturers... Of course, the gentlemen in charge may think that now American goods are attacking, and domestic manufacturers can't resist, so by doing this, they can get the reputation of giving preferential treatment to public teachers and employees, and also rescue manufacturers, and themselves... It's really killing three birds with one stone. And as time goes on, the manufacturers will be rescued, and naturally there will be people who support them; the trade deficit will be reduced, and they should be promoted for their achievements. However, what I am worried about is that "the future is long", and who can guarantee that the "bright future" that they have set their sights on will not "dream more at night"? The proper way is to be realistic, then I can only ask the gentlemen at the distribution office to go to some domestic goods companies or domestic goods exhibition halls and sit and chat, which is more practical.</p>
<p>So, this is what Melton wool fabrics are like. Army wool blankets have already flown to the hands of Jewish merchants on the border. It is ridiculous and hateful, and we must speak out; whether it is "wool fabrics" or "blankets", we must investigate this kind of scam!</p>
<p>(Note: In the previous article "Official Distribution of Melton Wool Fabrics" published in this journal, it was assumed that this so-called Melton was genuine American Melton, so it was pointed out that the government should distribute more domestic goods. Now we have learned that the "Melton" distributed by the government is only a fake American product, which can be said to be well-intentioned and admirable!)</p>
<h3>Inside Story of Seeking a Spouse</h3>
<p>— Qiao Sheng</p>
<p>One day, in the classifieds of a certain newspaper, an advertisement for seeking a spouse appeared: "Miss ×, aged 20, possesses both beauty and virtue, and has a gentle temperament. She now wishes to find a boyfriend, aged between 23 and 26, with a university education and a clean family background. Those who meet the requirements can send letters to ×× P.O. Box 235, and those who are a good match will be interviewed."</p>
<p>The next day, a great many applications were received. The applicants all described how beautiful they were, how profound their knowledge was, and how wealthy their families were...</p>
<p>A few days later, the applicants all received a letter, the gist of which was: Not knowing the level of the other party's education, please write a love letter.</p>
<p>Thus, the applicants put their minds to work, wholeheartedly writing a perfect love letter, hoping to win an interview with the "beautiful and virtuous, gentle-tempered" beauty. Some even went through back channels, seeking ghostwriters, and at the same time, respectfully addressed the envelope and solemnly dropped it into the mailbox. Thus, they waited for the arrival of good news; however, strangely enough, this love letter seemed to be a stone thrown into the sea, without any response.</p>
<p>Several months later, an advertisement for ×× Bookstore appeared in the newspaper, revealing that Dr. ××'s great new contribution—the Complete Collection of Love Letters—had been published!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the "love letter masterpieces" of those applicants from several months ago were all typeset and printed in it! Unfortunately, the author was not you, but Dr. ××!</p>

<h3>The Organization of Beggars 12</h3>
<p>— Huang</p>
<p>Genuine and Fake Refugees</p>
<p>"Liao Di Gang" is one of the street scams run by veteran beggar gangs. It is a kind of group begging performance. But since its purpose is only to seek voluntary donations, although it is a trap, it is not an illegal activity. The organizational method of the group is to select six or seven men, women, old and young from the beggar gang, resembling a family, complete with parents, children, and daughters-in-law. It would be ideal if an old woman with white hair and wrinkled skin could be found. The method of composition is like a theater troupe selecting actors, and it does require some effort. China has suffered from frequent wars and constant famines for years. In addition, the Japanese invaders have been harassing the country for many years, and the number of refugees fleeing to Shanghai from the interior is increasing daily. The influx of genuine refugees has provided an opportunity for the sharp-eyed and quick-handed veteran beggar gangs to organize fake refugees from the original beggars, in order to absorb donations from the public. Those engaged in "Liao Di" must wear broken but not tattered clothes, so as not to be seen as beggars in disguise by discerning people. When passersby stop to watch, the crowd grows larger and larger. Then everyone puts on a mournful face, and one of them, a good speaker, tells the audience about the disasters in their hometown or the tragic circumstances of their plight in a touching voice, in the guise of a spokesperson. They say that they have left their hometown and come to Shanghai, but unfortunately, they have not met their relatives, their funds have been exhausted, and the whole family has not had food for several days, begging the audience for donations. Passersby then throw money, and those who do not donate can only leave. And because there are many passersby, the income is also considerable. When the accounts are settled at dusk, after deducting 10% for the local gangster beggar boss, the remaining amount is distributed in different proportions, not equally according to the number of people. For example, the main actor gets a higher reward, and the elderly are valued for their rarity, so they cannot be treated shabbily. The remaining supporting actors, known as "mahjong tiles" by insiders, are common talents who are easily found, and they are not afraid of quitting if they are given less. The most valuable is the old woman playing the white-haired grandmother, because this kind of talent is the most scarce in the beggar gang, and young people cannot be disguised as old. They must be genuine old people. A group with such an old person can get the most money. This is a secret of the trade that deeply understands the psychology of the audience. Who doesn't have parents, especially a white-haired old woman? Extending this to others, it is inevitable that they will feel compassion. However, this kind of group is also constantly changing. A certain beggar may be in Group A this week, and next week he may be mixed into Group B. Although their situation is pitiful, it is a deceptive tactic, and the fake is mixed with the genuine, which in turn prevents genuine refugees from receiving donations. This is really hateful!</p>
<p>This kind of "occupying land" beggar gang originated very early, and passersby are used to seeing it, so they gradually see through the inside story, and donations are less. Moreover, it is difficult to spread it by word of mouth, and sometimes it is not as convenient as written propaganda, so the tricks are renewed, and the "white-headed business" has emerged. This is what Shanghai people call "complaining on the ground." This gang must have someone who can read and write a little, and use a piece of chalk to beg on the street. They write mournful words all over the ground, eloquently expressing their feelings. This is what it means to sweep away civilization! But sometimes the beggar is uneducated, so he has to ask "passersby" to write a draft, formulate the words, and then the beggar who knows a little "classical Chinese" memorizes it and writes it on the ground in the same way. A more straightforward method is to ask a down-and-out scholar to write the words early in the morning when there are few pedestrians, and then have the beggar stand guard, pretending to be his own masterpiece. The scholar has already received his fee and retreated. Who would have thought that beggars could afford a secretary? Pedestrians come and go, and no one goes to the bottom of it, only thinking that the scholar is in a desperate situation, and they all generously donate. At first, this kind of begging was quite profitable, but over time, the flaws gradually became apparent. And it can be seen everywhere, and it is difficult to absorb money anymore!</p>

<h3>Prediction</h3>
<p>— Jiang Liu</p>
<p>In order to increase the national treasury revenue, the Ministry of Finance is now planning to levy a "special wealth tax." One of the targets of the tax is: those who win the first prize in the lottery will be taxed uniformly. And it is said that the execution is extremely strict, and if the report is false, all of their property will be confiscated. It is expected that a new pattern of "secret lottery" will appear in Shanghai soon, and the advertisements will definitely promote: guaranteeing that customers will not "lose the chicken and the rice"!</p>
<h3>"Corrupt Officials" Laugh</h3>
<p>— Hua Shi</p>
<p>It is said that because of the depression in Shanghai, the funds of wealthy merchants and officials here have been fleeing to Hong Kong for the past month, totaling more than 30 billion yuan. Hong Kong's industry and commerce are booming. Even though the British brutally killed Zhang Tianxiang in Shenzhen, the Chinese are still rushing to it, fearing to be left behind. Who says that merchants are hateful? They are indeed shouldering the great ambition of opening up friendly relations and turning hostility into peace!</p>
<h3>Suggestion</h3>
<p>— Que Chou</p>
<p>The surplus materials stored in Nanyang are coming in large quantities again. I suggest to the Shanghai Municipal Authorities: open up temporary markets as much as possible to accommodate vendors, otherwise, the price of glass in Shanghai will rise like a rocket again.</p>
<h3>Public Opinion</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>If I were also a National Assembly representative, then I would definitely advocate making Jiangdu, Jiangsu, the capital, because that is my hometown.</p>

<h3>Let's Talk About Customs Gold Units</h3>
<p>— Ding Yi Chang</p>
<p>There are probably no countries with more styles of banknotes than China! Even if we are not people from banks and money shops, we always have many various banknotes coming and going in our hands every day for the sake of life. If that is a straight-edged, brand-new banknote, when you are free, take a magnifying glass or your sharp eyesight to explore it, and you will find many patterns and unspeakable "secrets." I think the interest is no less than that of "a certain stamp."</p>
<p>Here, let's first take the "Customs Gold Units" note as an example, and write down ten questions, hoping that the readers of "Free Talk" will all try it. It includes some general knowledge and printing knowledge. This time, it is difficult for us to set a standard saying how many questions must be answered at least. However, guessing the answers separately with friends and family and comparing them with each other is still the best way to measure.</p>
<p>The questions are entered into the topic, please rely solely on memory to think and answer, without taking out a few Customs Gold Units notes to "search for the steed from the picture."</p>
<p>(1) When you carefully count whether there are enough 100 sheets in a stack of brand-new, straight-edged "Customs Gold Units" notes that are exchanged from the Central Bank in unopened bundles, a pleasant fragrance rushes into your nose. Who says it is the smell of "copper"? But I want to ask where this fragrance comes from. Do you think it is because:</p>
<p>A. The banknotes were shipped from the United States to China and happened to be placed in the same cabin as oranges and bananas?</p>
<p>B. It was just a deposit that a certain lady took out of her handbag, so "there is still a lingering fragrance"?</p>
<p>C. Or, is it the smell of a special solvent in the printing ink?</p>
<p>(2) There are often sparse small red, yellow, and blue dots on the front and back of the "Customs Gold Units" note. Do you think this is:</p>
<p>A. Printed on the paper to increase the beauty?</p>
<p>B. A unique secret sign of the "Customs Gold Units" note?</p>
<p>C. Or, when manufacturing banknote paper, small circular colored paper pieces are mixed into the paper to prevent counterfeiting?</p>
<p>(3) In addition to the text, do you think the pattern of each "Customs Gold Units" note, whether on the front or back, is:</p>
<p>A. Completely the same on the left and right halves?</p>
<p>B. Completely different on the left and right halves?</p>
<p>C. Or, generally the same, but there are great differences in the details?</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the "Customs Gold Units" notes with different denominations, according to your memory, do you think the size of the note surface is:</p>
<p>A. Completely the same?</p>
<p>B. The larger the amount, the larger the area?</p>
<p>C. Or, except for the three largest amounts being the same, the larger the denomination of the smaller amounts, the larger the area of the note?</p>
<p>(5) Do you believe that there are several English letters hidden within the oval frame of Sun Yat-sen's portrait on the front of the "Customs Gold Units" note? Can you explain its meaning?</p>
<p>(6) Whether it is next to Sun Yat-sen's portrait on the front or in the graphic of the Central Bank photo on the back, there is an English letter "C" hidden in a circle of less than half a millimeter. Do you think the meaning of this C is:</p>
<p>A. An abbreviation for "Copyright Reserved, Reproduction Prohibited"?</p>
<p>B. An abbreviation for "American Bank Note Company"?</p>
<p>C. Or, the signature of the draftsman?</p>
<p>(7) The serial number of the "Customs Gold Units" note is a six-digit number, with two English letters added before it. Taking the "Customs Gold Units" note with a denomination of 50 yuan, which is equivalent to 1,000 yuan in legal tender, as an example, if the first one is "AA000000" and the last one is ZZ999999, without any breaks in between, what is the total value in national currency? Can you choose a suitable number from the following three numbers within two minutes?</p>
<p>A. 676,000,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>B. 756,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>C. 70 billion yuan.</p>
<p>After answering the above eight questions, for the remaining two questions below, please take out a Customs Gold Units note and "savor" it before answering:</p>
<p>(8) To sum up various printing techniques, there are only three types: "relief printing," "planographic printing," and "intaglio printing." However, it is quite difficult for the various printed materials we usually see to have all three. Only "Customs Gold Units" notes and certain securities have relief, planographic, and intaglio printing. Please indicate which printing technique each of the following three parts of the Customs Gold Units note belongs to by filling in "relief," "planographic," or "intaglio" appropriately in the parentheses!</p>
<p>A. The part with the same color on the front and back and occupying the largest area ( )</p>
<p>B. The part with the most colors and the greatest changes in the middle and lower part of Sun Yat-sen's portrait on the front ( )</p>
<p>C. The red serial number and the two red square seals ( )</p>
<p>(9) Careful people may have already noticed that in the "Customs Gold Units" notes with different denominations, the blank spaces on the paper always have some very faint colors. For example, 100 yuan and 200 yuan have a bit of light gray, 400 yuan has a bit of light green, and "purple Customs Gold Units" and "red Customs Gold Units" also have some light purple or light red, respectively. What do you think the reason is:</p>
<p>A. The color of the banknote paper used is different?</p>
<p>B. The original plate was stained during planographic printing?</p>
<p>C. Or, the residue of the printing ink during intaglio printing?</p>
