<h3>宋子文等訪晤馬歇爾　當前大局正在商談　民盟政協代表由滬抵京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕行政院長宋子文，交通部長兪大維，廿八日午曾與馬歇爾特使會談一小時許，聞談話內容與東北停戰事有關，馬使可能於明後日接見甫自上海來京之民盟各代表。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕軍政部長陳誠，昨在紀念週演講時，曾檢討當前局勢？謂依據目前情勢言，大局發展之動向，仍不外「和」，「戰」，「拖」，惟欲望全面和平能眞正實現，必須遵守停戰協定，恢復交通，依照整軍方案，整編軍隊，表示和平之誠意。陳氏並謂：以目前國家處境，民衆痛苦言，大局實不能畏此拖下去。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕確息：共軍如放棄以武力宰割東北之企岡，自動從哈爾濱，齊齊哈爾等地撤退，政府仍本寬大爲懷之初衷，可能暫劃興安省境爲共軍防區，並給予若干便利，俾共軍依照整軍方案，從事整軍。至東北政治間題，應尊重國家主權及東北人民意見，俟政府完成接收工作，普遍成立民意機構後，依法辦理，絕對反對特殊化。按興安西接蘇聯及蒙古，北及東北隣進黑龍江，東由嫩江，南與遼北省及察哈爾接壞，面積二十四萬九千餘公里，轄呼倫，臚演，奇乾，雅魯，室韋，布西等六縣及索倫一設治局，以呼倫（即海拉爾）爲省會，由國府任命之現任興安省政府主席爲吳煥章。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕民盟政協代表黃炎培，沈鈞儒，梁漱溟，章伯鈞，張君勸等五人，廿八日下午二時由滬抵京，中共代表團秘書長齊燕銘，民盟辦事處葉篤義，參政會王同業等皆赴站歡迎。五代表下車後，旋赴藍家莊十五號寓邸休息，並對記者發表書面談話略謂：東北內戰是多年來罕見之慘劇，民盟及靑年黨，無黨無派政協代表一致要求停戰，願與各方共同努力，促進和平云，又羅隆基今致電民盟駐京辦事處謂，明日飛京，據消息靈通者言，一俟各黨代表集京，即將舉行政協預備會，以便各方交換意見，共謀和平之實現。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕國內大局在一週內似尙難有開朗希望，某觀察家語記者，目前雖雷雨已過，而陰雲仍未消散，持久之局面，可能爲雲散天靑，亦可能醞釀一塲新雷雨。蔣主席留瀋已屬第六日，尙無南返消息，今且傳主席將於明日赴長春視察，凡此種種，皆足表示政府對接收東北主權具有堅定不移之決心。而中共方面則認爲退出長春已爲彼等之讓步，彼等恐難接受撤出哈爾濱之案件，以交通問題諭，政府主停戰必先恢復交通，而共方則主先停戰再談恢復交通，雙方意見尙有相常距離，如此種距離不日漸縮短，則馬帥似無赴瀋可能。因彼若遠赴瀋，只許成功，不許失敗，必不願徒勞往返也。觀察家指山，關內情勢亦未許遽予樂觀，冀魯·蘇北。豫東各地之戰火，隨時可死灰復燃。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿八日電〕張君勱稱：和平解決，頗有希望，自國軍收復長春後，東北並無眞正戰事，實際上戰事業已停止，祗須東北局勢解決，其他一切均將自然而然，隨之解決。民盟所提東北和平三點建議，或須修改，俾能適合局勢。中共方面似頗願意停止戰鬥。</p>
<h3>平漢津浦兩大幹綫　中央令積極修復　侯馬小組商恢復同蒲路</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕此間交通當局，接中央電令，命積極修復平漢·津浦兩大幹綫。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原廿七日電〕俟馬小組政府代表沈國輔，美方代表倫台爾，廿七日午晋謁閻長官，對恢復南同蒲綫史（村）運（城）段交通事，有所商談。據聞倫氏就其蒐集中共方面對修復該路之意見，作坦白報吿後，復徵求政府方面意見，最後決定由人民公營事業會接同蒲路爲人民公營，與中共方面交通機構，各自派員在臨汾直接商談，由小組根據和字第四號命令監督之。另據記者獲悉，中共方面要求修復該路，由政府方面供應材料，而鐵路管理權由中共控制。</p>
<h3>軍調部將加強　東北調處工作</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕軍調部現正準備加强東北調處工作，如關於東北協議短期成立，軍調部將增派小組前往工作。目前東北執行小組工作，亦可望逐漸展開，刻廿八小組已由開原前往四平街，第八小組可能赴長春，惟哈爾濱派遣小組間題，尙未徵得中共同意。</p>

<p>〔合衆社長春廿八日電〕記者與此間一百六十名蘇聯人中之六個特出人物晤談之後，獲有一種印象，即蘇聯與中共人士間之關係，並不　外界意料中之良好。共　佔據　春之五週期間，據此　蘇聯人　：彼等搶掠華人，同據亦刦　蘇聯人民，某次，共軍強迫徵用　春之蘇聯國外貿易局房屋，　蘇點人表示拒絕之際，共　即以粗暴口吻吿彼等謂：「汝等旣僅與中央政府交往，關於此屋問題，亦請逕向中央政府交涉可也」。此等蘇聯人聲稱：基於中蘇條約，莫斯科祗承認蔣主席所主持之政府，致使延安之共黨政權喪失面子。</p>

<h3>國際政治陷於僵局的癓結　——讀莫洛托夫談話之後</h3>
<p>從昨天起，四國外次又在巴黎　續開會，替下次四國外長會議進行一切籌備工作了。依照上次四國外長會議的最後決定，擬於六月十五日重開四國外長會議，再決定召開歐洲二十一國和　會議的日期，至遲不得超過七月底；所以在巴黎舉行的四國外次會議，又為世人視綫集中的焦點了。但是今後數月內所召集的國際會議的前途如何？將視蘇聯與英美的態度而定。在上次四國外長會議中，因為蘇聯與英美兩國的意見紛歧，各持意見，不肯稍讓，乃陷於僵局，以致會議不歡而散；事後雙方發表言論，又復互相推諉責任，甚至互相底毀，使我們對於下次外長會議的前途，也不敢稍存樂觀的心理。</p>
<p>先是美國國務卿員貝爾斯返國向全國人民發表廣播演說，報告四國外長會議開會的經過情形；並鄭重聲明美國的外交政策，其言有曰：「吾人爭取和平，僅能視為剛展開工作，吾人決為爭取歐洲近東及其他地區的政治的及經濟的和平而奮鬥到底，吾人將在和平會議中或在聯合國各理事會中，農開此項工作；吾人之目標，並非為美國爭取領土或賠款，而是為全世界爭取和平。世人須知：和平絕難建立在報復與貪婪的基礎上，唯有基於正養與公理上之和平，始能維持久遠。」在他的語氣之間，把四國外長會失敗的責任，完全推在蘇聯身上。當時蘇聯政府並未予以答辯．僅由蘇聯新時代雜誌發表一文，攻擊英美兩國政府傾向强權政策，而採取「原子外交」；並謂英美代表在四國外長會議中對於各項最感棘手的問題所抱態度，並非基於各該國生存攸關之眞正利益、亦非基於國際安全與永久和平·更非為保衝若干小國利益打算；而其用心別有所在，此實為巴黎外長會議失敗的主因云。</p>
<p>由此可知，美蘇兩國的意見，不啻南轅北轍，旣無法接近；而且互相矛盾，愈演愈烈，漫無止境。國際政論字雖在那裏為　蘇諒解而吶喊，為美蘇合作而呼籲；但是始終不能挽回兩國間的逆流；例如在美國雖有人發起設立美蘇協會，從互相認識中求得互相諒解；雖有人主張貨款與蘇聯，從經濟的合作，謀得政治上的諒解；甚至還有人主張與蘇聯締結友好條約，以條約來保障美蘇間的邦交。前國務副卿威爾斯也說：「巴黎外長會議的失敗，由於美蘇對於未來世界新秩序的基本性質未能商得恊議所致。今日的世界為恐懼與猜疑的愁雲慘　所簡單，因在各國之間缺少具有建設性的領導者，致使其雲霧益見濃厚。蘇聯企圖擴充其防禦地區，而認此為唯一的切實的安全感。美國應作最後努力，務使蘇聯相信，唯有採取「四海一家」之政策。其安全始能獲得保障」。但是美國方面的這些行動與表示，對於蘇聯究有什麼作用呢？凡是渴望戰後世界步入民主和平的新時代的人們，莫不盼望美蘇兩國眞能成立諒解，從而將世界和平建立在鞏國的基礎上；所以對於蘇聯眞正的意向如何？更迫切地需要澈底了解。史達林元師在五一勞動節與五九勝利日兩次發表的演說，都沒有滿足我們的慾望；但是前天蘇聯外長莫洛托夫向眞理報記者發表談話，却說明了蘇聯對外的眞正意向。</p>
<p>莫浴托夫談話的含義有三：（一）蘇聯對於和平會議的態度，仍堅持原來的主張；就是非至四强對於歐洲和約商獲初步恊議，不能召開二十一國和平會議；也就是反對美國國務卿貝爾納斯的建議：「在四國外很會議不能獲致協議時，即將歐洲和約問題，提付聯合國機構討論。」並指斥此議違背波茨坦宣言的規定。（二）蘇聯對於英美仍抱着不妥協態度，莫洛托夫不僅譴責英美以威脅與恫嚇對付蘇聯，而且謂英美兩國在四國外長會議中向蘇聯發動攻勢，美國得英國之贊助，欲在世界各處，廣設海空兩軍基地，企圖以其意志，强加諸於他國。（三）英美以經濟協助為手段，企圖控制義大利與其他國家，使其成為推行資本主義政策之工具：故巴黎外長會議的失敗，英美兩國應負其責</p>
<p>奠洛托夫的談話，率直坦白，毫不客氣、攻擊美國的外交政策，幾近於護駕，把外交上的詞令與禮貌，都置之不顧；可知蘇聯與英美間的關係，已到了短兵相接的階段；連外交上的客套也用不着了，展望四國外長於六月十五日在巴黎　續開會　的前　，更覺得黯淡無色。不僅歐洲和會召開無期，即使開成；也很難有圓滿結果，國際局勢長此相持下去，若不設法打開僵局，則永無世界和平可言，谷國的安全，更無保障可言。我們不得不為整個世界的前途憂慮。惟今日國際問題的癓結，顯在蘇聯與英美之間的矛盾無法消除，而兩大集團的對峙的形勢，日益露骨，在眼光犀利的政治外交家看來，當能燭照無遺；如何挽回今日國際政治的逆流？首在消除蘇聯與英美間的猜疑與矛盾。在思想上，蘇聯是社會主義的國家，英美是資本主義的國家，好比水火之不相容，似無妥協約餘地；但在共產主義與民主主義之間，還有很多的共同之點。吾人正可以從這些共同之點，互相研究，互相探討，互相諒解，以免雙方的疑慮愈結愈深，在事實上，蘇聯為了自己的安全，拚命向外擴充其「友好圈」，以增强其「安全感」；使英美惑到惴惴不安，此在英美為了世界的安全，亦欲在世界各處廣設海空基地，並保守原子能的秘密，不肯公開，以鞏固世界和平的基礎；　蘇聯也感受到英美的威脅。因此雙方互相攻擊，互相猜疑，不能自己。無論如何解釋？始終不能使雙方的猜疑，煥然冰釋。其實　方最需要的，第一是和平，第二也是和平；如能立即恢復大戰期間的友好精神，推誠合作，共同重造世界的和平，更是雙方所日夜　求的。所以從這一隻角度去觀察，要蘇聯與英美釋嫌言好，並非不可能。</p>
<p>要之，今日國際僵局的癓結，完全在蘇聯與英美的積不相容，如欲打開目前的僵局，如欲挽回國際的逆流，則非謀得蘇聯與英美間的諒解與合作不可。一味召開國際會議，是無濟於事的，觀於戰後一連串的國際會議，不是議而不決，就是決而不行，沒有一次不是失敗的，就可以知道再召開國際會議，仍不能打開目前的僵局。為今之計，唯有設法謀得蘇聯與英美之間的諒解與合作；何其由最重要的，首在停止雙方的「宣傳戰」，以免　　雙方人民的感情與神經。</p>

<h3>法軍侵犯邊境事件　暹決向安理會申訴　美派員赴出事地點調查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿八日廣播：英外交部今夜正式宣佈：暹羅決向聯合國安全理事會提出申訴，請求安理會立即調查法軍侵入並進犯暹境事實。英外部發言人稱：英方贊同將暹羅申訴譴入安理會議程內。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕國務院發言人稱：暹羅越南邊界發生事件後，吾人尙未接獲許確之報告，惟就所已獲之情報觀，法軍之侵入，似亦不過一「邊界事件」而已。曼谷方面已派出美觀察員一名至出事地點視察，據悉該地並不位於暹羅與越南所爭執之土地內。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿七日專電〕自曼谷傳來消息謂，暹政府雖已向安理會告發法軍侵犯暹羅邊境，但聯合國秘書處迄未自暹政府接獲有關法軍侵入之報告。按聯合國憲章第廿五條規定，暹羅雖並非聯合國會員，但如其得預先聲明，接受憲章所規定和平解決之義務，則有權提出控訴。然因美英刻擬不久提出請暹加入聯合國，故在此情况下，暹羅此次對法之控訴，實令其偏促不安。是以法暹新糾紛，可能由美英出面調停，而不列入安理會議程。法政府發言人今日在聯合國聲稱，法國沿暹越邊界之軍事行動，係由於越南邊境入寇暹人之「過度排擊」所致，駐越法當局曾屢次廣播警告暹政府請其壓制此類　擊。但迄未能照辦。</p>
<p>村落遭刧掠</p>
<p>〔聯合社曼谷廿七日電〕暹羅政府今晚正式宣布：法軍劫掠暹羅村落事，將向聯合國機構提出詳細報告。該村在湄公河龍蓋上游，星期日上午六時法軍八十人渡河搶劫一家，旋有八百人過河搜刧全村歷三小時，直至傍午始去。</p>

<p>糾紛之遠因</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿七日電〕駐聯合國機構之法國發言人昨稱：法方在暹越邊界可採之軍事行動，係因暹人越界入越南境內，從事重大挑撥之故。越南之法當局一再以無綫電警告暹方，不得再有此種越界之事，然暹羅官方竟充耳不聞。此間觀察家指稱，暹越問題之發生，早在一九四一年，當時暹人憑日本之勢力，侵佔越南柬埔寨五分之一之土地，曾有猛烈之戰事。至一九四二年一月廿八日，曼谷·河內，及維希同時宣布雙方已接受日本之調解，戰事始告停止。</p>

<h3>美報之正論　亞洲歷史文化美應深切瞭解　中國文明基礎歷久不替日本文明乃中國之支流</h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山廿七日電〕舊金山紀事報今日載稱：「美國全體人民對於亞洲及其複雜之歷史，文化與政治，所知頗膚淺，亟須有更深切之瞭解，往事已證明吾人可能在亞洲交戰，且在此交能工具，瞬息千里之時代，美亞兩洲相隔僅一箭之遙，今後吾人實應多多知悉亞洲實况。美國學校類皆忽視亞洲之研究，言之可恥，彼等責任所在，應使此忽視風氣，一變而為瞭解。太平洋關係學會已派遠東專家多人，組成委員會，研究美國各高等學校普遍採用之敎科書，發現一般世界史課本記敍亞洲部份，僅佔百分之七，一般美國史課本記敍遠東部份，僅佔百分之三，而一般地理課本，亦僅十分之一記載亞洲及其萬萬人民。據太平洋關係學會報告：一般敎科書均有自傲論調，稱太平洋彼岸之鄰邦為低劣落五國家，目今吾人之工作，必須從頭做起，凡是論調傲慢，宣傳　自愛國主義之課本，均應束諸商閣，務使高校一般學生瞭解中國文明之基礎，及其歷久不替之原因，更應明瞭日本文明，乃中國文明之支流，但已失其本來面目，及其不同之處，究竟何在」。該報結論稱：「如果下一代子弟較吾人並未更深切瞭解亞洲，則後事將不堪設想」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長國楨昨午假新生活俱樂部歡宴本市各報社負責人，席間吳氏致詞略謂：「本人奉命來滬，一切市政措施，均以民意為依歸，但現在民選參議會尙未成功，欲求了解市民意見，惟希新聞界多眞正民意，而輿論機構最足為市政當局一切行政設施之準繩，本人作事，以有益於全市市民為前提，任何阻力，在所不計，為貫澈本人主張即犧牲名譽地位，亦所不惜。旋即請在座各位發表意見，由胡樸安，程滄波，王芸生，潘公展等先後發言，對市政方面建議頗多，吳氏對所提各點，均表示接受，並說明二點：（一）關於淸道夫罷工問題，現已完全解決，並無條件，市府允許對彼等將來之生活，予以合理調整，市上尙未淸除之垃圾，因日久積存，一時輸送不及，現已向善後救濟總署商借用工務局修路車輛協助運輸，今明二日內當可全部淸除。（二）關於警政新設施，外間頗多傳說，其實警管區即英美推行已久之District　System，將來實施之後，當不致有外間所揣測之種種流弊。此外吳氏申述個人之觀感，認為目前最重要之工作，為（一）抑平物價，而欲抑平物價必須首先平抑糧價，連日奔走接洽結果，糧價問題，大致已見平抑將來亦無問題。（二）工潮問題，目前本市工資之高，業已超過美國工資標準，例如棉紗一項戰前生產成本僅及美金三分，現則已超過四角五分，而美國目前之成本僅為一角六分，本人固不欲將工資壓低，惟賢明工人亦當知欲食鷄卵者當不能先將母鷄殺死，今後工人若再提出提高工資之無理要求，則五六月後，上海生產事業勢將發生全部停頓之危險，此實本人所認為最感憂慮者，最後吳氏希望類如今日招待會，能時時舉行，俾市民之意見得由新聞界轉達，而市政當局亦有所依據云。</p>
<p>胡樸安　略謂：目前上海最大問題，一為民食問題，一為居住問題，糧價不斷高漲，民生不能安定，亟應迅速謀抑平，居住問題，原在上海居住者，尙不感覺困難，其於勝利後由後方來滬之人士，則覓屋不易，實為一極嚴重問題，希望能速予解決。</p>
<p>程滄波　略謂目前亟須解決之迫切問題，第一為糧食問題，吳市長蒞任後，對平抑糧食所採取之措施，市民無不熱誠擁護，惟目前囤積居奇，操縱市塲之糧食奸商，依然暗中活躍，希望市長以雷厲風行之手腕，嚴厲法辦，藉收「懲一儆百」之效。其次為衛生問題，交通問題，治安問題，均應密切注意，力謀改善。關於治安問題，一般人僅注意防止盜匪搶劫，而不知此僅為「狹義的治安」，尙有「廣義的治安」，尤應特別注意。蓋自勝利以後，有不少特殊階級，憑藉地位權勢，作種種非法行為，欺凌人民，敲詐人民，此種惡劣風氣，必須予以澈底革除，以吳市長之地位資望，深信必能克服環境阻力，解除民衆痛苦。</p>
<p>王芸生　略謂：（一）民主政治，導源於希臘，希臘之民主政治，實為市府政治，即市府與人民打成一片，現值民主時代，凡屬新民之官，應帮助人民生活，解決生活上種種問題，而不應再謀管人民，抗戰期間，政府以「管」「敎」「養」「衛」四字，為地方政治之目標，此項口號，現在應予修正，蓋政敎必須分開，政府無管敎人民之權，亦無養民之力，所謂衛人民安居樂業為第一要務，但欲達到人民安居樂業之目的，必須除暴安良，如果少數暴力份子不能除去，則社會秩序即無法維持，良善人民亦無法安居樂業，時至今日，政府當局必須拿出決心與勇氣來，除暴安良，而不能再事因循猶豫，試以工潮為例，上海最近所發生之工潮，已由經濟性而變為政治性，暗中煽動工潮，操縱工潮者，大有人在。例如：日前人力車夫罷工，並非全體一致，但却有人執力專事戳破人力車輪胎，阻止車夫拉車，此輩搗亂份子，並非車夫，實係蘇北某方所派來彼輩除從事破壞工作，並以在「解放區」榨取之法幣，套購物資，抬高物價，嘗見某業罷工工人所貼標語，有「餓死不如犯法」之句，試問：旣有人公然煽動「犯法」，而政府竟不予查究嚴辦，則社會秩序何能維持，人民生活何能安定，本人始終主張「治　世用重典」，惟除暴始可安良。其次，本人極同意芸生先生之意見，凡屬不必辦之事，以不辦為宜，一切與革措施，在未舉辦之前，應注意民意。</p>
<h3>中央銀行巨竊案　節外生枝　重慶銀行圖滅證據　塗改被扣帳簿　經理朱芝菲無從傳案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行巨竊案主角寗波人陳元成，現正由警方追輯，但經查悉陳曾輾轉抵押於重慶銀行之金磚，計押款六千三百萬元，言明以十天為期，詎至期，並未前往贖回，故由該行將金塊售去。黃浦分局於吊回原臟之後，復派員赴重慶銀行上海分行，將做押款賬簿一本吊案查閱。誰知重慶銀珩經理朱芝菲，竟於前晚九時由友人偕同前往黃浦分局，要求周光輝股長，將賬簿給予查看。乃由姚鴻章巡官將賬簿賜予一閱，豈料朱忽乘隙將其中做黃金等違法押款之賬目七筆，加以塗改，企圖湮滅證據，以免受中央銀行金融檢查處分，其後來即不知何往。事後黃浦分局發覺朱之非法行為，立即傳訊。該行聲稱朱已離滬，當由該行襄理吳志剛投案解釋。此一巨竊案中節外生枝問題，現正由警方核辦中。</p>

<h3>貨輪無法進口停泊美軍船隻將移靑島</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本市美海軍當局，刻為改善港口中船隻之擁擠起見，已考慮將留駐本市之大批美海軍船隻，逐步移往靑島。緣靑島港口，適於海軍工作之展開。而本市港口，對大型船舶，竟無法容納。本市外商航業方面，以港口內停泊船隻之擁擠，竟使外來船隻無法泊岸。以美國總統輪船公司而言，現滯留港口外待泊之船隻，竟達八艘之多。故外貨內流，遂發生窒礙。加以美海軍船隻佔用碼頭甚多。現自第卅碼頭起，至外灘為止，此段間商貨之駁運費，每噸須美金三元五角，卅號碼頭以下一段駁運費，每噸達美金五元二角五分。故美海軍船隻移駐後，即可有大批碼頭勝出供用，各貨之駁運費，自可望减低云。</p>

<p>全市油漆工人為要求將待遇每工六千元提高至一萬二千元，未有結果，乃於日前開始怠工。昨日並至社會局請願，要求調解。</p>
<p>中航公司　華機塲職工，要求調整待遇，數度談判，迄無結果，公司方面尤以每人暫借二十萬元，俟復工再行計議，工方因此項辦法與實際要求相差尙遠，未予接受，故復工之望仍無期。</p>
<p>染職業手帕業職工，因向資方要求改善待遇實行罷工，昨晨十時許曾再度籲請社局調解，雙方談判結果，意見相差甚微。然資方有意使工潮延長，已深為當局不滿。</p>

<h3>汪逆私人秘書受審　湯良禮有靈魂？　有誰能信　柳汝祥等四案辯論終結劉星辰案今日下午宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨十時，高院特刑庭由邱推事首次提訊汪逆精衛之私人秘書湯良禮，被告延陳霆銳，許蔭　二律師出庭等諭。湯為福建雲蕭人，年四十六，上展　有東洋鬍　，戴玳瑁邊眼鏡，衣灰色西裝，穿黃色皮鞋，狀甚蒼老。湯生於爪哇，曾入荷蘭籍，留學英國，說得一口流利英語，但不諳華語。故答供時，由陳霆銳律師權充通譯。湯於民國二十九年四月，充　宣傳部國際宣傳局長，著有媚日宣傳書籍，由汪逆精衛題名為「中國與日本為友是自然的為敵是不自然的，」交中國聯合社出版，內容曲解父之三民主義，並斷章取義，極盡媚敵之能事。三十年五月，兼任偽外交部次長；同年九月，兼偽宣傳部次長；三十二年九月，調充偽國際問題研究所所長，迄勝利為止，經軍統局拘獲，解由高檢處偵查起訴。據湯供稱，自幼即反抗帝國主義，其在爪哇時，因迫於荷蘭之壓制，流亡英國，十五歲起，加入抗日同盟會，以文字為武器，反抗日本帝國主義。一九三〇年歸國，從事抗日宣傳之實際工作，因不願受異國領事裁判權之保護，乃將荷蘭國籍證交還，仍入中華祖籍。其所著之抗日英文書籍，如「滿洲國傀儡政權」，「中國之建設」，「中國之鐵道」，「中國對日本侵略主義之反抗」，「中國之新幣制」及其所編之「人民論壇」等，均為抗日志士所愛讀。一九三九年為日所拘，不久雖被釋放，但行動受其監視，並因彼擅長著作，頗有名聲，乃强迫其充任偽職，惟均為空名，未做實際事務。並堅稱：「我的身體雖被他們征服了，但我的心，我的靈魂仍是歸向祖國的」。在其偽國際問題研究所長任內，卒因工作不力，為日方所不滿，乃被免職。並力言其並無反抗本國，有利於敵偽之一切行為。邱推事以該案猶需詳細調查，乃諭改期再訊。退庭後，被告接見家屬，詢問家常，旋即押入監中。</p>

<h3>打破傳統敎育的首創者　北碚育才學校　美一週雜誌顯著地位刊載消息</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處舊金山廿七日電〕美「一週」雜誌，十九日以顯著地位，登載重慶北面五十英里之北碚，專為天才兒童而設之「育才學校」情形。該校創辦人為陶行知博士。陶氏卒業美國伊利諾斯大學，且為科倫比亞大學著名敎育家杜威之高足。</p>
<p>創辦動機</p>
<p>據該雜誌稱，一九三八年，陶氏在漢口曾遇一衣衫襤褸流浪街頭之兒童，時渠方指導若干蹲伏道旁之幼孩歌唱。陶氏即携該童赴音樂師處接受訓練，三日內該童竟能於聆聽素不熟悉之歌曲後，以樂譜將曲調寫出。陶博士此次經騐，遂萌創辦學校之念。渠招集少數敎師，彼等均願從事此種幾全屬義務性質之工作。彼等在中國十五省之內，曾先後訪問及測騐數千兒童，搜覓天賦特佳之兒童。此等兒童，可望成為中國未來藝術界及學術界之領導人物。育才學校成立之時，係以若干作家，藝術家，音樂家，及科學家為核心。</p>
<p>捐款來源</p>
<p>其後陶氏向美國方面請求援助，美國人士凡有捐助，均交由紐約聯合中國救濟會　轉。聞捐款之最大來源，為美國學校之兒童，現該校有學生四百人，年齡自六歲至廿歲不等。此等幼童，係戰區農村或殘　之家庭中挑選者。彼等經過測騐後，如表現特殊才能，則可受養成靑年藝術家，音樂家，作家，科學家，及社會上作者之訓練。然彼等所受敎育，並不以此為止，每一學生均認為以彼等所學習事物，傳授他人，為彼等應盡之責任。</p>
<p>敎導農工</p>
<p>以是此等學生，每日至少須以一小時之時間，敎導約二千農人，礦工，及若輩之家屬，讀書寫字，並授以衛生，手藝，及民主原則等智識。兒童每週上課時間，自三十六小時至四十小時。彼等並學習救護，烹飪，縫補衣服，抄寫，駕車，游泳。唯彼等似對音樂，演劇，繪畫，舞蹈，文學，自然科學，社會科學等，最感興趣。該校為打破中國之傳統觀念起見，校中員生，均親任各種勞作，藉以養成自立能力。彼等甚或自洗衣服，自製用具，並在學校一部農塲耕作。</p>
<h3>尊師運動　學生勸募圓滿結果書畫義賣即日抽籤</h3>

<h3>一個理想的小學課程　應該注意智德體美四方面的活動</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>小學課程標準的修訂會議，正式舉行了，我們服務小學敎育界的，覺得非常興奮！尤其是在抗戰勝利的今日，這有關我們中國基本建設的敎育會議，更使我們寄予了非常深切而熱烈的期待。然而事實告訴我們，會議的召開，沒有理想那麼隆重。所謂參加修訂的「專家」，不以全國普遍的羅致為原則，也不以超特人才的攬延為條件，隨隨便便就近聘請了幾位，匆匆忙忙在開會了，這樣草率了事，試問有何成績可言？</p>
<p>本來敎育部對於此次課程修訂，定有六項原則：（一）各科課程，尙嫌　複，應力求簡化·扼要·有趣；（二）敎材範圍，應適應兒童身心發育，使兒童易於領受；（三）敎材內容，應有普遍性，城市鄉村應能兼籌並顧，並注意時間性和彈性；（四）義務敎育，應以六年為最高標準，課程須注意六年一貫之原則，但得以四年為一段落；（五）訓練方面，重視個人道德的修養，法治觀念，民主精神，及民權實施；（六）課程標準，是整個的，智德體三育並重，不能僅偏於知識科目。這六個原則，倒還提綱　領，大致楚楚，可是一經「專家」們討論之後，又增加了下列兩個原則：「（一）小學課程應注意公民·康樂·科學·社會·語文等五方面之活動。（二）小學課程，是小學階段內希望達到的最小限度的人格及行為的改變。」這增加的第一個原則把公民·康樂·科學·社會·語文·分成五方面活動，就原則上說，似乎有些累贅，而且有些　漏。最不可解的，是把「科學」和「社會」，分作兩方面來說，其實社會是科學的一部分，小學課程裏面的「社會」和「自然」，都是「科學」，現在「社會　「科學」而獨立，不知將來實際編制，課程時，如何着手？</p>
<p>至於增加的第二個原則，似乎專重於德育了。究竟小學課程，是不是只是希望小學階段內最小限度的人格及行為的改變，就算完事？這明明是不合邏輯的。</p>
<p>一個理想的小學課程，似乎應該注意於智德體美四方面的活動，就是降而求其次，也該按照敎育部原定的第六個原則，只求其「智德體三育並重」，這還覺得可以自圓其說。一孔之見，不知道是否適當，敬請貴報賜予發表，希望「專家」們予以多多指示，不勝感荷！</p>

<h3>金我價繼續疲怯　美鈔依然鋒俏異常</h3>
<p>烚赤昨晨開雖告穩，惟為時至暫，自一八〇萬外逐步下游，隔夜浮多恐慌，曾跌至一七六萬以下，而後稍定，美鈔　俏，套買仍殷，不久微升至一七八萬左右，掙扎殊久，中行配給一三二條，價微降為一七七萬五，十日後仍形盤旋，無何美鈔方面仍來套買，近午回升至一七九萬以上，午刻在一七九萬光景，午後初穩　平，最後在一七八萬前後，結果較前收微降五千，飾金仍掛十九萬元，紋銀平，銀元禁止賣買，喊價雖與前日相彷彿，購買不易唶拆息價仍站一角三分左右。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔仍多洋行結款，異常緊俏，自晨開二三〇〇元，求過於供，逐步盤漲，金市不振，中途多盤，無如需求終殷，不易回跌，午前曾升至二三六〇元，而後稍回，午後隨金價進退，初穩後平，結果與前收相較微升十元，港票初平後穩，結果亦帶好五元，港電四一〇元至四二〇元，羅比五二〇元，稍有做開，美匯告平。</p>
<h3>多空角逐步之下公債先疲後堅</h3>
<p>公債多空各顯神通，起仆殊速，統丙以北帮多頭出售，晨開後自七四五〇元見疲回降，空方乘勢壓迫，終於打破七千元大關，見六九〇〇元低價，抬面帮逢低维持，得以支持，某銀行以小型游資，落手吸納，得此助力，散戶興奮，午刻又扳高至七三〇〇元，結果與前收相彷彿，甲乙戊熱鬧異常，丁種極為冷僻，是以甲乙僅低一百元，戊種五十元，丁種則獨跌四百元。</p>
<h3>紗市客銷不旺現棉交易减色</h3>
<p>昨日紗市榮辱互見，二十支紗平庸之至，在五千元之間盤上盤落，十六支雌伏已久，昨乃鋒芒獨露，陡漲四五萬元，四十二支雙股綫亦因隔日紡建只售商管，而大件絲毫不配，致同行居奇，藍風價升至二百五十三四萬，亦較上日跳起五六萬，客銷不旺，人心尙稱安定。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊報跌十五至十八磅音，計近期美金二七·七三，遠期二八·三三，米特林現貨二八·三五，本埠現棉交易較為减色，絲金價頻疲，美棉報跌，廠家均懷觀望，僅同業稍有點綴，市價大致相仿。</p>
<h3>紡建供給不足布市初疲繼昂</h3>
<p>昨日市始疲繼昂，晨初以值中紡開售布疋之期，一般浮多吐出，軋直銀根，俾可再向中紡開進，同時客方亦抱觀望態度，所以市况疲　，行市跌一千元，中午中紡掛牌，十二磅細布奇缺，不能供應，僅十二磅無牌彩球一種，安安藍布自七百七十五號至末號，再一號至一百二十九號，皆有分配，其餘號碼一律全無分配，觀音漂布之分配，亦未足額，因之午後市面又為一振，漲起一二千元。</p>
<h3>台灣糖業公司　二次拋售中砂</h3>
<p>台灣糖業公司今日第二次拋售中砂糖，關於每包糖之含量，客商申請資格及付款方法，均與前無異，惟該公司根據穩定物價，普及實銷用戶，以防杜囤積起見，將客戶申請方法加以改善，即事先幷不宜佈糖之價格，凡客商可按期塡具請購單，向該公司購買食糖，該單於當日上午十時至十一時送交該業務處下午四時至五時領取准購核定數量，同時宣佈價格，每單位仍以五十包為限，按本月廿四日該公司第一次賣出中砂八千九百五十包，每包計重一百八十市斤，每百斤售價六萬六千元。</p>

<h3>當前之繭價問題　成本增高蠶農虧蝕無錫縣尙須征特稅</h3>
<p>（無錫訊）江南蠶絲中心地無錫地區今春育蠶收成頗為不佳，緣今春育蠶初期即感蠶種缺乏，以致種價同漲。　桑葉價又大跳，直接增加育蠶成本，間接影響蠶身健康，因蠶農鑒於桑價太高，乃不　優劣，均以飼蠶，當此鮮繭上市之際，繭價不逮成本，據估計每售鮮繭一担，須虧蝕五萬餘元云。</p>

<h3>長春廿九天　（十一）</h3>
<p>— 本报特约记者　邵慎之</p>
<p>在我們拘留生活中，共方的新聞工作展開中共東北局機關報東北日報從吉林移來，長春親報復刊，甚至於日文報民主日報（民主日本社發行）創刊，頭條論文題目是「中日提携，民主鬥爭實現東北建設，意欲　　」。還看到過一張日文油印報，說是美國記者所乘小　機失竊，這是造謠，其他的消息我們不敢說。</p>
<p>我們只能在屋子裏展開採訪，可是屋子裏的幾張沙發椅子都看　了，每個人的面孔都　熱了李普曼因此向　　提議，請八路軍借機枝機關槍給我們玩玩，讓我們發開來對打一陣，直到大家都倒在地上爲止，也可以省得以後的麻煩了。</p>
<h3>日共活動</h3>
<p>我們廿四日由周保中派了護衛帶我們出去，也就是前文中所稱的第二次「自由」，我們在大街上走，但見成百成千的日本人，確大搖大擺底在街頭漫步著，反比我們自由自在。我們當時心裏上很不舒服，總覺得長春的日本人，有另一種人和另一種勢力在活動。這另一種人和另一種勢力，我們可以具體報導的是日共。</p>
<p>廿五日的晚上，當周保中來我們記者寓所吃晚飯的時候，慎之首先就問他：「長春的日共，現在非常活躍，我們在廿日還看見他們告長春日僑的小傳單。此事不知你的看法如何」？周立刻答道：「日本人在我們的眼光看來，不管他們革命或不革命，都一樣，他們終究是日本人。」他繼而又問：「在延安的日共領袖罔野進和東北的關係如何」？周答：「根本沒有關係」。便是罔野進在長春數的告日僑書確是個事實。世洵問他：「那末你對於政府現下遣送日僑工作，看法又如何」？周答：「在我們看來，他們如其喜歡留在此地，那也無所謂，反之，他們想回去的，我們自然也不反對」。</p>
<p>我們沒有親眼看見日本人混在共軍裏行戰，因爲我們是拘禁在屋子裏。所以事實真偽，在我們讀者面前，我們不能亂說。不過駕駛車的　機和在盡頭上用粉漆塗寫大標語前，確是有日本人，混在一起工作，却是我們親眼看見的。世洵曾有一天在汽車中間呂正操工廠裏是不是仍有日本人，呂正操也沒有豆腐過，不過他說：「這些都是　員」。他告訴我們在水電廠裏，在電車公司中，還有日本雇員。</p>
<p>共軍把長春佔領以後，在開始的時候，一切秩序尚未澄清的時候，日共並不怎樣大肆活躍。僅僅在街頭上可以看到罔野進的「告日僑書」。貼在牆上或散在地上。這張傳單是我們大司務，在廿四日上午買菜歸來，從街上搶來給我們的。</p>
<p>廿六日，日共的活動比較具體了。在長春成立了所謂日本人民主聯盟長春準備會。廿七日發表沉長的宣言，並且有具體的綱領。都當前工作設施之規條。</p>
<p>關於綱領方面，其譯文如下：（一）團結在東北日僑，聖駕東北之建設，並努力東北和平，發展真正民主，日本進步之民主戰綫，將早日促進祖國之建設。（二）本會將與中國之民主自治政府協商，確定吾東北僑胞之安定生活及社會上的政治地位。三滅除國內軍國主義，排除國內反動份子，清算帝國主義獨善之觀念。並澈底加強民主主義之活動。</p>
<p>關於工作設施之規條有三，建設平和統一之新東北。（二）排除軍國主義與反動份子，並清算軍國主義，（三）參加新東北建設之技術合作。（四）確立新東北建設土地上日僑之居住權，動產權，營業權及耕作權。（五）確立普及民主教育。（六）澈底救濟難民。（七）急促解決歸國問題。（八）提攜中國人民之友好。（九）促進日本民主建設及廣大民主戰綫。</p>
<p>同時在廿七日那天，通過了日本人民主聯盟長春準備會與中共支持之長春市府協商，決定把以前在長這反民主聯盟之日文報紙數張封停。據我們知道的停刊的報紙計長春日本人新聞，東北日本新報，日僑長春報三種。</p>
<p>因此，繼之而起的有民主日本社支持出版的民主日本每日新聞半大張。每張二元，每月四十五元。這是目前長春惟一的日文報紙，所以發行相當的廣。</p>
<p>該報在廿九日創刊。創刊的社論是：「中日提攜，民主鬥爭實現東北建設之意欲維護」一文。此文在前節已提起，茲簡譯其要者如次：</p>
<p>「今日東北人民自治軍，已進入長春，因此我日本人之民主活動，亦得因而充分自由。我人將與此中國最進步之指導者合作，日本人民主聯盟長春準備會之成立，其意亦在於斯。」</p>
<p>「此中國最進步之指導者，予我人以民主主義鬥爭之廣泛自由，因此，我人將繼絕過去之帝國主義指導者，決定創立中日兩民族之真確友好。」</p>
<p>民主日本每日新聞，決本東北之日本僑人之利益，確立居住和產營業，耕種等之保護。誠　熱心讀者，民主戰綫之良伴，一體擁護之。」</p>
<p>在中共支持下的長春市政府，（原有大同廣場附近之市政廳，已於此次戰爭中，爲共軍　夷彈焚　，目下共黨之市政府，已遷至火車站附近之舊大興事務所內），已規定日本人文化社會團體之組織。同時經過日本人民主同盟的請求，共方長春市府已將大量雜穀及燃料，交日人應用。此外復設立所謂外事局，僑民科，及民族科。</p>
<p>我們因爲在屋子裏的日子多，出去的日子少，即使可以出去，也是　個片刻，並且都在「保護之下，所以知道的東西也實在太少了。我們不敢說罔野進在長春，我們確實沒有看到他，據我們所長春親報，在現下長春活動得最有力的日共是西尾三郎，他曾經寫過一篇沉長懇切的告日本青年書，這題目是：「青年同胞向上轉機之書文告。」也同樣於廿九日，在民主日本每日新聞創刊上佔了一個顯要的地位，內容與日本人民主聯盟長春準備會之宣言，大同小異，但該文都回溯明治建設，作一個總的歷史上的巡禮，而說到民主自治的真諦。</p>
<p>日共在長春自由活躍，無疑的，是事實了。但是他們究竟有多少共產黨黨員，活動的圈兒有多少大，這就不是我們可以知道的了。</p>
<h3>春來遲遲</h3>
<p>我們在拘留生活中，廿五日才發現柳枝初生萌芽。五月一日我們兩人和貝克的秘書劉柯陪同，經過大同廣場到火車站，再到幾個商場去看看。這是初次嘗試出遊。</p>
<p>第二天，劉居英請我們吃飯，周保中在席上宣佈說：「自今天起，各位可以自由出去採訪，可以隨便到什麼地方去，同隨便什麼人去談話。」</p>
<p>戰爭已過了半個月，這個戰爭故事在半個多月以後來寫，戰後的情景如何是一個謎，如何寫法呢？統統冷掉了。新聞性已經失去了。</p>
<p>這是一個難題，我們只好去逛市場，坐日本人開的咖啡室，免得繼續悶下去。</p>
<p>可是我們每個有無不讚美長春，長春美麗，柏油馬路清潔開闊，即　石路也平滑如砥，砌成　案，引人快感。路旁遍植垂楊和法國梧桐，這時嫩綠初放，只見一陣淡淡的綠烟，彌漫在這路上空和建築四週。雖然長春已到處是　樓敗屋，斷項殘壁，但是我們仍然讚美，下了公正的評價，說它美麗不下於華盛頓，或者可說是小型華盛頓，而忘却了戰爭的痛苦。</p>
<p>長春市區南北一萬六千公尺，東西一萬二千公尺，公園五個，廣場十餘，動植物園有一千二百市畝大，展開市區地圖一看，（在戰爭中我們就　這張地圖來　識　聲所在和一切情況）雖然這城市當未依照設計完成，但我們立刻認出這城市中國第一，任何城市比不上。</p>
<p>我們坐汽車在猛烈的春風中走，還是要穿皮衣。車子在火車站停下，火車雖然南北都通，可是車站上悄然無聲，發現不滿十個老百姓在等車。他們茫茫然，只望有車來可以搭一搭，去想去的地方，原先貝克特在那裏買伏特加喝的地方，不免要懷　一番，可是進去一看，什麼也沒有，連破玻璃瓶也沒有一個。只剩到處是灰塵。</p>
<p>車站前面廣場中心，有四個土堆，大約是埋著四個死屍，上寫俄文名字，是這次戰爭中的犧牲者也未可知。却沒有看到犧牲了的中國老百姓的地方。</p>
<p>車站　場也清　極了，有十來個共軍士兵在練習手榴彈。</p>
<p>於是　子立刻回到火同廣場，我們去恁吊中央銀行。十幾天以前在這裏沸騰著戰爭，現在聲息全無，我們的　　在銀行四周打了一個圈子，建築完好，不過　上有許多　彈坑，可是沒有一顆是洞穿牆壁的，玻璃窗則沒有一扇不破碎。著火燃燒過的部份，火　曾經打窗洞裏冒出來，把窗洞外面舐得烏黑。一面吸飽　烟的國旗還掛在上面，每天掛廿四小時，被風撕破，受盡折磨，無人照顧。</p>
<p>中央銀行門開著，沒有一個守衛的兵。聞劉柯說爲什麼。據答進而恐怕還有炸彈地雷之類。我們沒有走進去。但　著後門原先堆著的無數箱籠物件以及器材，則已完全沒有了。一陣大風刮過，只聽得碎玻璃還在不斷掉下來，到處　啷　啷的響。淒涼萬狀。看到這種情景。我們都不禁心酸。中國人在這裏流了多少使中國人民痛苦的血，使世界嘆息的血！</p>
<p>我們到市場的時候，已經是下午三時，十七天前曾經來過一次，三個百貨商場雖已開業，可是這時已經收起，進去一看，只見空空洞洞的櫥櫃和不陳一物的木架，——貨主們已收起商品跑回家去了。他們過去也是這樣，但總要到五六點鐘以後，本來這一帶街道上擁擠不堪，日本的天照大神的啟光　盡之後，日本人在這一帶求謀生活，搭小如　籠的木產，賣「生啤酒」和Sakola出賣衣服和日用品，以至小件的　具，這種風景在東北每個地方，只要有日本人居住之處都有，他們賣掉東西維持生活，有些女人最後只好賣淫。長春在三個百貨商場附近幾條街上都擁滿了這樣的人　，蘇聯人稱謂「上高市塲」這名詞現在還有用，四馬亭的時候，你只要對車夫說就是了，他就會把你送到這個地方。</p>
<p>這天我們跑去一看，光景大不如昔，經過動毛之後，什麼塲合要復原都不容易。後來我們跑進一家日本人開的小咖啡店去，仿佛如一座古廟，燈火黯淡，看我們來了一　人，把幾個日本女人忙得不可開交，我們屋角一望，居然發現還有另外兩個客人：兩個兵正一聲不響地在喝著酒。但不到五分鐘，他們就溜掉了。</p>
<p>我們這輛車插了有「吉　軍區」四字的小紅旗，上坐穿軍裝的美國人，穿便衣的中國人，有武裝保護，路人都投以奇異的目光。</p>
<p>多處廣場和馬路口正在搭木製的牌樓，用木板裝釘成立壁式，再施油漆，有不少中國人和日本人正在努力工作，等到三四天後，我們再出來時，已經金壁輝煌了。</p>
<p>我們三個人還是淒　涼涼的回到寓所，所得的印象如此，可是當眾却大吹其牛，說得引人入勝，後來們　全體拜訪那小咖啡店。後來又發現了一個名呌「安琪兒」的跳舞場，都是日本舞女。據劉柯的說法，舞女是不生產的，原則上應該禁止，但在沒有給她們解決正　職業前，不能加以禁止，影響她們的生活。</p>
<p>到五月一日才算看到一點春天的樣子，在南方是不能想像的。這一節裏，我們所企圖寫的，就是長春被共軍佔領後，我們第一眼所獲得的印象。我們開始從做賣買的人手裏，找回共軍所發的元·十元之類的「東北銀行券」。</p>
<h3>工人大學</h3>
<p>四月　日的東北日報上有一条消息，题目是「東北工人大學積極籌備　學」，新聞內容如下：「「本報訊」東北工人大學現已選定偽滿「宮內府」爲校址，正積極準備　學事宜，有學員三晨餘，均係電業，鐵路，技工等各種產業工人，現正在修繕新校址，學員親自動手，工作情緒很高，很多人說，「做夢也想不到今天會住到這個地方。」據王校長談，現正在繼續招收學生，並將於日內派學員百名幫助本市工運及其他　眾工作。該校並準備　工人日報反映工人學習，生活，與要求，並將於「五一」勞動節出版。」</p>
<p>五月三日吃過中飯，我們三人和　動等在劉柯陪同下到「宮內府」去。宮內府門口有一塊嶄新的　底白字的油漆　子，掛在崗亭上，上寫「工人大學」四字。有兵守　。我們初意也不過想來看看溥儀的寶殿，看看偽政權傀儡的舞台佈景。我們到處亂跑，偶然有些房間住著幾個共軍，此外簡直看不到人。這一座大建築物簡直拆空，因爲這實在是一個集中的目標。我們發現一處宮　　被拆開，通進一條小鐵軌去，以駛行手　　，這決不是這回共軍裝的，那是相當日子以前的遺跡。</p>
<p>這裏的兵都佩著一種　號，共軍得符號，這是第一次看見，那符號是白底紅黑藍字，就是工人大學四字。有幾個　權十五六歲的小孩子正在吃飯，也佩著這種符號，我們問劉柯說：「他們是不是這裏的大學生？」劉答：「不是，這裏什麼也沒有準備好」</p>
<p>我們正亂跑的時候，忽來一個似乎是軍官的共軍，佩手槍，也佩工人大學符號，向我們說道：</p>
<p>「你們是那裏來的，也不通知一聲就進來了，沒有允許，怎麼就隨便拍照。」—一頓官腔。</p>
<p>我們回答他，請他同劉柯談，劉柯便上前解釋，那位先生還是滿不高興的樣子。</p>
<p>東北過去企業發達，產業工人數目可觀，現在把他們吸收入「大學」，這實在是「過去做夢也想不到」的事，他們顯然正從事於共產黨義的訓練，而並非爲學術性的大學。</p>
<p>另外在長春出現的一個大學是以張學思爲正校長，白希清，舒　爲副校長的東北大學，我們只看見招生廣告，沒有看見其他。廣告中說：校址：設長春，分校設吉林。招收名額：預料五百人，本科醫學院二百人，自然科學院，社會科學院，藝學院各三百人，研究室名額不限，却可以擔當　格或專門技術同等學力去投考。</p>
<p>關於組織「民兵」的事，我們也僅從報紙上看到。四月三十日東北日報載：「不怕壞蛋威脅，田村長積極組織「民兵」新聞內容如下：</p>
<p>「〔寶　訊〕第一區青椅由農民代表田福順被全村人民公選爲村長後，責夜忙於爲人民辦事，村裏壞份子看了不高興，有一個晚上，趁他辦完公事，　回到家裏躺下，三個壞蛋就拿著斧頭在門外高喊著他的名字要他的命，他急忙爬起來（自他被選爲村長後，就預防壞人，所以晚間睡覺不脫衣服）也拿起了一把斧頭大聲的在門口回答說：「我什麼時候該你的命，你講清楚，我還你的命就是了。你要錢，多了沒有，十元八元的有，你過來拿吧！」這三個壞蛋一聽事情不妙，就溜走了，事後這位村長不但沒有被壞蛋威嚇住，反而工作更加積極起來了，也覺得以後這樣的事情一定還會發生，因此他便積極的組織民兵，四天的工夫他發展了廿三人，並向區裏要求發給土槍自衛。」至於被俘一的保安隊，共軍已把他們編成「新兵」，已成爲「戰士」。根據五月三日東北日報的記載，在五月在日「防問錢石部隊俘虜」一文中寫道：「民國時當兵，官兒爲了爭地盤，當兵的就不知這爲　是啥；偽滿時隊伍在關外關裏到處就是討伐「　軍」，　了中央軍還是打「匪軍」，八路軍我才當，官兵一樣我是非常佩服的」記者又向已編入新兵連的俘虜去訪問：剛走到門口看見一　穿灰戰士在打球，就知道一定是「鐵石部隊」的俘虜，遂即問其中一個戰士：「這裏後怎麼樣？」那個戰士楞住了，頓了一　答說：「怎麼樣！可以自由了，你看我們在打球。」</p>
<p>四月廿五日長春又有了電流，重慶發壳，電車開始通暢，可是中長鐵路公司的中蘇人員都在這天撤到哈爾濱。因爲「這些鐵路屬於中國人民」，（周保中語）　共軍遂加接收，大和旅　則改爲　「外人賓館」，據宣佈現在共軍在東滿控制的鐵道有一千三百公里至一千四百公里，在兩滿則爲九百公里到一千公里。</p>
<p>五月三日的報紙上發表了延安的廿九日電，說是「東北民主聯軍已於廿八日和平進駐哈爾濱」四月底開始準備開「慶祝剿匪勝利追悼陣亡將士　眾大會」，到我們區走時，只看見報紙上已改稱爲「保衛和平勝利慶祝大會」，特製定標語口號四十二要，其中第廿六條是「八十萬長春市民團結起來，保衛長春」！</p>
<p>過去共軍攻長春的時候，八十萬市民沒有「團結起來」，民眾們還在奔走呼　停戰，在　火下死傷的老百姓仍以千計，這次如果政府軍再來攻長春的時候，八十萬市民就要「團結起來」了，怎麼樣？自然是「保衛長春」，這就是政府和共軍做法不同的地方。（未完）</p>

<h3>甲蟲式汽車</h3>
<p>可能成爲住家，有廚房等設備</p>
<p>舒服狀態　堪　空前</p>
<p>據　　亭柏汽車公司（Graham-PaigeMotors）的斯道特式談話，新式汽車可成　一所流動的家產，車中的座位可隨便變動，白天有舒適而且可以移來移去的座椅和開合兩用的桌子，晚間可成爲一個舒適的臥室。</p>
<p>斯道特氏是「斯道特甲蟲式汽車」的製造者，甲蟲式汽車係按照他的理想而造，汽車引擎裝在　後。</p>
<p>甲蟲式汽車，八年前就已「問世」，然其成就和發展始終保守秘密。該車的發明人是現任格　亭柏汽車公司總工程師。斯　特氏於　　甲蟲式汽車旅行二十萬哩後，談稱：「我澈底嘗試了我的　　，它和我的理想　　的地方固然不少，然而我却從此曉得何者應予保留，何者應該拋棄。」它所用的是普通的引擎其大小和重量正和通常的引擎相同。因此該車的後部就較大較高，而且除了車內就沒腦筋行李的空處了。它較普通汽車只略微經濟一點，「然而它的舒適却是空前的」。</p>
<p>引擎和車身開　有一層防火的牆壁，這一層壁　熱氣和聲音不能傳入車中，而且構成座椅或臥休的靠背。車內平坦寬大，　五　八寸，長約十　。</p>
<p>車後座前面，有兩張可以隨意移動的椅，椅是傾斜的。椅面用「水泡橡皮」　成，靠手寬大舒適。車內地板完全用厚地毯構成，和起居房屋別無二致。駕駛　和普通的一樣，　夫的座位和　體配合。極便利　夫進出，旁邊設有一門，車後的那一邊也爲客人設一進出的門。</p>
<p>斯　特說：「在高低不平的路面上，我們每小時行　七十哩。車人的人除車夫外，都圍坐在桌子旁邊吃喝。」</p>
<p>「新型的汽車，可能民爲住家，其中有　房等設備。無論如何，車身總比普通的寬大點，舒適點，華麗點。」（美新譯）</p>
<h3>廣西人時機破涕爲笑</h3>
<p>— 本報廿二日廣州航訊　特派員梁小中</p>
<p>光怪陸離的事情，像一瓶到處傾瀉的毒水，一點一點地滴下來，五光十色，再好看沒有。旁觀者看了，多少總覺得有點目眩神搖。原來桂林有一個「文化聯誼會「，成立已有數月之久，起初的確無誼可聯，近來却變得有議可亂。而且這一亂，的確太使對它抱著很大期望的人（如記者就是一個）大大的打了一個折扣。</p>
<h3>一塲風雨　旁觀者笑破肚皮</h3>
<p>話得從頭　起：在「五四」那天，聯誼會的先生們在師範學院附中禮堂，熱烘烘的開紀念館，到有三　五岳未聞其名「文化人」不少。店間流涕不已者有，　慨激昂者有，「民主」的道理照例演過一番後，一位先生突然揮臂　首，高聲在呼：「中國人不應該接受外國，（尤其是美國）的救濟」。言下大有一受救濟，中國必會馬上中毒而亡之慨。跟著便說：「救濟是騙人的事，胡佛來華是幫助反動派來引誘我們的，這種救濟外面是糖衣，裏面是毒藥」，好一套妙不可言的妙論，說話的先生　做　爲霖，是「民主週刊」的編者，家裏很有幾個錢，據說是無黨無派。然而　論一出，次日的「廣西日報」記載著「聽者無不詫異的報導。再次日，中央日報的社論痛切指出：這是一種最沒人性的新法西斯主義的真面目的總暴露。讀者們紛紛投書到各了館，指斥這位「坐在家裏吃安樂飯不知天高地厚」的靳先生是糊說八道。靳先生看了之後，一時三　暴跳，馬上來一個嚴重更正，仿佛是：「我一句都沒有說」。跟著，由他們的大本營——文化聯誼會——發出一通哀的美敦書，要報館道歉，否則便不得了。看看沒有下文以後，繼著發出快郵代電，到處散發，真有「不是你死就是我亡」之狀。據說：還在準備告狀，一塲風雨，真令旁邊看的人破舌了肚皮。說文化聯誼會對吧，有點聽著良心，說它不對吧，文化聯誼會高揚「民主」的招牌，的確未便指責。總而言之，說中國不要接受救濟不止姓　一個人就是了一直到今天，這件公案還在鬧個不清，不過，大家對「文化聯誼會」，「民主週刊」之類的東西，的確都已有點「豈止說討厭而已」的感覺。</p>
<h3>豆渣榨幹　那來下五萬噸糧</h3>
<p>僅管　不著邊際的人怎樣胡說八道，救災工作却的確一刻也不容停一停手了。貪糧告絕的時候，幸運地，一　甘霖救回了多少　裂的田土，下種遲，自然收成也就遲。（其中還要靠天保佑，要風調雨順）。最少要在七月下旬才有新穀登塲，這一段青黃不接的時期，如何是好呢？三個月內，假定災民有三百五十萬，這是一個最低的估　則最少需糧十四萬五千噸到十五萬噸，災期始克勉強渡過。廣西目下是一塊榨幹了水的豆腐渣，那裏來十五萬噸的餘糧？自然，就只有仰給救濟分署，而救濟分署目下運到，和尚在運輸途中的，只有　粉三千噸和食米四十萬磅。說起來真是要　一聲：「如何是好」？於是，只好自己也拼命的展開一個救災運動。各地的救災會紛紛成立，桂林的救災委會舉行義賣，黃主席也捐了一塊古硯，結果總共只賣了四十多萬元，報紙也義賣，也賣了六十多萬元，湊來湊去，還買不上一百擔米，望穿秋水的只有望救濟分署增加救濟物資，那就阿彌陀佛了。</p>
<h3>花言巧語　圖掩飾中飽罪行</h3>
<p>最令人悲憤的，是救濟品施放時候的最壞現象。領到救濟品的縣份不在少數，但是什九都是到今天還在遲遲不發，有的還要，拿來賣了說甚麼築水　咯，築知咯，一片花言巧語，希圖掩飾中飲的罪行，有些縣份發是發了，難民每個領到的是十兩八兩，而工作人員的「工作酬勞」，却可以得　粉多至四五十斤，而且還公然以　粉爲賭本，大事淫佚，那裏管到小百姓的死活？</p>
<p>桂東的荔浦縣的難民，沒有領到　粉，跑到縣府去哭，去請願，却被縣長指爲「造反」，開動在隊　察，把難民包圍起來　毆一塲，而且　捕各地爲首的人拿起來「殺一儆百」，啊！好一個民主時代　風八面的百里侯！</p>
<p>災難　重的小百姓底呼　呌苦　，　　片一樣　到　　界裏。救濟品的散發，不過只是千百種花樣裏面的一門頭，把災黎當豬當狗的事情，多得很，說出來，大可連　促膝，作長夜之談。清　愛民的官，不是沒有，不過這又多少令人悠然沙　　金的故事了。小百姓受餓而死，只有怨天。受比　餓更痛苦的死，的確不能夠不怨人！</p>
<p>兩年來在廣西，靜靜的　，急急的變，甚麼時候欲哭無淚的人們才能夠真的笑一笑呢？</p>

<h3>軍人的呐喊</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我們的部隊，過去加了一個特別的「別」字。也就爲了有這「別」字，我們夏天穿過老棉軍　，在冬天穿過單小布衫。不過，我們的主管確實是好的，說起來會使你不信。在臘月裏，他曾把他自己穿的夾長衫，　去下半截，加點棉花，給士兵做背心空，當時我們是的確吃了苦的。我記得好像有一次，在敵人包圍中，從第一天中午起，到第二天黃昏，沒有得吃，　有點受不了。晚上能睡點稻草，是　爲「金絲被」的。當然，抗戰期內軍人吃苦，是應該的。現在，——現在是勝利了。雖然我們不敢站　了身體　　肩膀　口氣，但希望總有一點的。第一個使我們心　的就是發勝利獎金，一個上尉能發到三萬元。在去年，這個數字是可觀的，不過被「等因」不對，不發「奉此」不對不發到現在，「等因」發是發定了，可是「奉此」祇准發半數。我倒也很高興，拿著圖章去領這筆去年　　到現在的「半數勝利獎金」，可是軍需笑著對我說：「你的勝利金已奉上面的指令別除了」。原因，是爲了部隊改編時被編在同一個機關的另一個部隊了。一個抗戰了八年的軍人，就爲了這點原因而別除了勝利金，況且是被編的，當然不祇有我一個，也算不了一會事。我們的待遇，上尉是二萬五千元糙米三斗，吃用都在內，士兵更不用說了。常常聽說加薪，可是「祇聽樓梯　，不見人下樓」。就是補發的話，雖然不會遭到勝利金同樣的惡運，到那時幾張鈔票或許又要小下去，在這種高壓的生活下，實在壓得喘不過氣來，請貴報披露，求求大人先生們救救我們可憐的軍人吧！守一敬上。</p>
<h3>電訊權仍將斷送嗎？</h3>
<p>編輯先生：傳說三家外商水線電報公司，——即英商大東，丹商大北，美商太平洋，即將準備復業了。他們要求復業的理由，自然也是　外商輪船的借口中國船　不夠運輸一樣，說是國際電台收發擁擠，每有延誤，他們是善意的來服務，來分勞。目下交通及外交當局，對此取何態度尚不可知，想一關國權的事，總該不致於馬虎吧？</p>
<p>記得第一次歐戰後，在華盛頓舉行的太平洋會議，我國力爭收回郵　及電訊權，費盡九牛二虎之力，總算各國在華郵局撤消，電訊祇解決了無線電台一律撤銷，水　部份則因當時契約年限未滿，未能解決，後來一直到國府　都南京，又幾經交涉，才把電訊收發部分收回。　日本對英美宣戰後，三公司同時停　。現在計算契約年限，據公司中人談及早已屆滿。況現在無線電發達，何苦再　　這些　方法的水線？即使有恢復必要，也願由我方自行辦理，何　再讓別人代　？如再把已滿期　權利原封送還，豈非笑話？</p>
<p>按關於航　問題，曾有航業　人士大聲疾呼，喚起朝野注意，何以對此電訊權，意無人留心及此？希望電訊界的人士，快點起來力爭。</p>
<p>不過我尚有一點意見：盼望在國際電訊方面服務的人，自己也要爲國家爭氣，對於收發工作，務必力求迅速，並且還要減少電文錯誤，（聽說國際收發錯誤甚多，傳送遲緩，每爲外人詬病）。免得被人藉口才好。　黃白虹</p>

<h3>貝多芬的兩支絕作</h3>
<p>— 魯莽</p>
<p>貝多芬（Lodwig　Yan　Beethoren）是十九世紀古典樂派與浪漫樂派過渡時期中的音樂作家，一七七〇年生於德國的　城，父親雖是個酒徒，對於幼小的貝多芬的音樂教育卻很注意，自小即有音樂神童之，可是貧病卻支配了他的一生，但同時卻充滿了豐富而纏綿的戀愛幫主中，作品與女性很多關係，他於一八二七病歿於維也納旅邸，享年五十七歲，在西洋算是短命了。他的作品甚多，器樂曲有九個交響樂，若干模範曲及弦樂四重奏等，　樂曲有彌　，歌劇有九個交響樂。</p>
<p>我聽過一支C長　模範曲及一支F短調模範曲，神往不　，我現在想介紹一下：</p>
<p>第一支是C長調　　　（L'Aurcre　Sonata），第二支是F短調模範曲（Appassionata　Sonata），這大部的名曲，在中國很不容易聽到，C長調模範曲是貝多芬當年獻給華爾斯坦伯爵的禮物，華爾斯坦為三十年戰爭名將的後裔，懷情豪爽慷慨，這曲中寫華爾斯坦性格與事蹟，歷歷如繪，那種英威豪邁之氣，那種慷慨悲哥之情，那種橫掃千軍的魄力，那種卓絕一時的風度，處處描寫名將後裔的特點，其中行板一段，寫華爾斯坦仰觀天象，凝神默思的情境，莊嚴肅穆，蕭瑟遍人。其中風聲一段，怒吼長嘯，閉目靜聽，宛如處午夜危樓，震撼心膽。</p>
<p>熱情的F短調模範曲，較第一支更偉大，這曲是貝多芬獻給勃倫史微克伯爵的禮物，一八〇六年伯爵的女兒戴兒沙曾與貝多芬訂婚，貝多芬對戴兒沙的一般熱情即寄寓於此，此曲自首至終，全部充溢着熱情，有人曾謂如大地之迸裂，爆發而衝擊蒼天，貝多芬自己也這樣說：要理解此曲須先讀莎士比亞的暴風雨（Tempest），可見此曲之力了。這曲子有時如山崩地裂，有時如萬　雷鳴，有時如秋　澎湃，有時如月夜行軍，使你喘不過氣，分不開神。有時因為感官太疲乏了，使你倦依在座上，竟想睡去，但是耳朶裏又像萬馬奔騰似的使你無法睡去，貝多芬的氣魄，雄偉到如此，真令人驚奇，尤其是天性甜靜沖淡的中國人，先天的習慣於「瀟湘夜雨」「九　春色」……一類纖細溫柔的和平曲　，對於這　越奮發的西方文化的結晶，確　你咋舌。</p>
<h3>時間</h3>
<p>— 楊企光</p>
<p>不願意離開你們的，但不得不跟你們離開了，誰不流　於故鄉山水的嫵媚呢！可是，難道這遍地的枷鎖之聲，竟還不能使你有所警惕麼？</p>
<p>就是你不說，我也全部知道：人類是怎樣去創造歷史的？一點一滴。都是交織着高度的笑聲與低低的飲泣。誰不在胸膛裏跳躍着一顆赤色的心呢？當你離開這災難的草原之區，有多多少少充滿着悽惻的故事，夠你去咀嚼，夠你去憤怒</p>
<p>就在那時候，我跟着一連串雄偉的歌聲，走向迢遠的征程，像在夏天的午睡一般，四週都發着　熱，但我終於拍拍身上的灰塵，開始踏上麟峋的山　，渡涉在像劍一樣豎向天邊的森林，撐起喉嚨，我跟着他們歡唱着時代的偉大。</p>
<p>可是，時間才是一個　無情者，這幾年來，看那些像駱駝一樣的矯健者，被風砂埋沉了，像燕子一樣的輕盈者，在樹蔭中消失了，在當初，誰不自誇著是松柏的色呢？但一律狂風暴雨之後，把那些禁不起吹打的　　在塵埃中了，那些雄偉的歌聲經苦難的磨折而滅絕了，延起一臉枯血的慘笑在暗綠色的燈光下出現，如同　靈一樣。</p>
<p>在那時，我失望地感到了痛苦。一個美麗的欺騙　破我的純潔的心。我似乎聽到有人在悄悄地說：「　呀！一個可憐的傻子！」</p>
<p>「天，我從　平如影的水面，瞧見瞧自己　被苦難磨折而失去光彩的臉色，現在已衰老得像一個老人了。我不會笑，我　　誰欺騙了，只是徒然地站在陡　的山岡上送去一連串煥發的日子，連跨開一步的勇氣都沒有。</p>
<p>時間才是一個有為的主平宰者，在他的面前，那一個不是怯弱者呢？人們都在這樣說：「時間是在拼命地走！」可是，時間并沒有走呵？人們自己在走呵！有的矯捷地擠在前面，有的卻擠在人後了。但時間付給最　敢者以不幸與傾跌，用各種各樣的苦難去靡折他長起滿頭的白髪？但牠又容忍那些拖在後面的人眼　勇敢的人跌入無底的深淵而吝嗇一點嘆息。於是，人們再沒有像江河一樣雄壯的歌唱，像松柏一樣青翠的顏色，像古代英雄石像一樣粗闊的肩膀。</p>
<p>你說：上帝是怎樣製造着人類的歷史的，一滴一點，都是交織着高度的笑聲與低沉的飲泣。而我呢？我卻是一手握一柄生命的蠟炬在廣闊無垠風雨中　走着，我無言地忍　　空虛和痛苦，加　在我的身上。</p>
<p>卡寨耶夫在「時間呀，前進」！這一冊小說中高呼道：「樣樣東西都從自己的地方移動，樣樣東西都出發了！」</p>
<p>我想，如果要根絕空　和痛苦的感覺，也許要我還得再「出發」一次的吧！</p>
<h3>愁</h3>
<p>— 悱村</p>
<p>小少　體會了什麼是愁，在高小的宿舍裏，浴着秋天下午淡淡的陽光，聽到校旁長河裏駛到故鄉去的小汽船的　　，小小的心便給蒙上一層深切的哀愁，那哀愁，供用　時耽　的王獨淸　達夫的詩文中的字眼，便是所謂Nostalgia的悲哀罷。</p>
<p>由少年而為靑年，濃豐的春天裏的濃豐的姑娘成了我愁的原因。南風沈醉的晚上，從『綠蔭從中，紅樓一角裏溢出來的悠揚的鋼琴聲與淸脆的歌唱聲曾經引起我何等的遐想！遐想的結果，於是首『春愁黯黯不成眠』了。又是一種苦痛。</p>
<p>雖說『　愁最苦』，然而愁而為閒，終究是頗有詩意，有人喜歡把自己浸在哀愁裏享受一種傷感的趣味麼？我是其一。</p>
<p>歲月不居忽忽已入中年，白天迎着　灰為衣餘奔波，晚間常是咳嗽盜汗，『妻也天只，不諒人只』，在抵得萬金的家書裏老是那套「孩子病了　，家裏的米缸見底了哪，大小衣裳都破得無法補綴了哪……』什麼鄉愁春愁之類早已經現實的重負壓得粉碎，現在終日黏在心上的是：窮愁！那麼的緊，那麼的重！</p>
<p>想到少年時的下筆千言不能自休，而今的對紙茫然，無從着墨，才始知道辛稼軒的『而今識盡愁滋味，欲說還休』的詷句是怎樣的一種境界。</p>
<h3>同情</h3>
<p>— 登臨</p>
<p>看不到綺麗的夕陽，也看不到皎潔皓月。據說，這就是瞎子之所以引起了廣大人類的同情的緣故。</p>
<p>世界上該同情的事豈僅至此，一曲天上的　歌，　者聽不到，滿腔悲憤的　　，　者廉江出，即至於一個可泣的遭遇，一幕可悲的戲劇，又何嘗不足以使人憐憫。也惟有了這些殘缺，人類方起了同情，否則，這世界似乎顯得太平淡，生活也似乎顯得太單調了。</p>
<p>「然而，什麼將使你掀起了真心的同情？」我問，我想試探一下我的朋友。</p>
<p>「這個麼？」他回答：是殘廢者吧！他得不到上帝賜與人的　利，他得不到上帝賜與人的恩惠……」</p>
<p>「不！」我笑着。</p>
<p>「那麼，該是一羣失去了歸宿的孤兒，他們失去了家庭的溫暖，他們失去了慈母的撫慰……」</p>
<p>「也不！」我笑了笑：「他們是值得同情的，可是他們都不會掀起了你真正的同情。</p>
<p>「喔！我知道了。」他思索了一下：「你是在說年青人的悲哀吧！一個失去了　歌的年靑人。他的生命驟失去了柔　的春水的　　時……」</p>
<p>「更不！」我狂笑了起來：「你雖說得不錯，卻都說得不凖。告訴你吧！這不是在那麼偉大的場面中出現，也不是在那麼可歌可泣的時候出現。它祗是在極細微的時候而卻能極廣泛的應用。」他雙眼直望了我。</p>
<p>「當一個人正患着牙痛，你剛起了牙痛的時候。」</p>
<p>人類的怎么是天賦的。殘　無睹。彷徨在歧途的孤獨對於有家庭者也祗是個　覺。雖則他們同樣的也有同情，但這同情是一天一小時甚至一分鐘一秒鐘的。過後，它彷彿似曇花一現，連影踪也難以找到。</p>
<p>記起了一個朋友的話：惟有在同一的環境，同一的遭遇中，才能產生真正的同情。</p>
<h3>鷓鴣天</h3>
<p>— 沈尹默</p>
<p>四月山居物候移，子規　裏囀黃　，亦紋乍展琉璃　，樹色　分　翠幛。白　　，夾　衣，新情悵觸舊歌詞，無多風雨和雲過，又　輕雲上　絲。</p>
<h3>釣魚</h3>
<p>— 安壽</p>
<p>山村裏除開小的溪　而外，沒有大的河流，海更談不到了。雖然這裏是近海的縣份，但和我們鄉村畢竟隔了好幾座山。</p>
<p>獨個人釣魚，不大有趣味，兩三個人最好，多了也覺不行。實在說起來，非常慚愧，我的釣魚是名不符實的。我甚至連釣絲都收拾不來，所謂釣魚，只是跟朋友們到水　去玩玩而已。</p>
<p>釣魚最討厭的是太陽，其次是風。山村的水邊沒有人栽過柳樹，「柳陰　釣」的樂趣是難於享受的，太陽猛烈的時候，不戴笠帽簡直會被陽光　得跳起來。風則會破壞恬靜的環境，水花激烈的波動和釣竿的　蕩，都使腦子安定不下。</p>
<p>釣魚最好　　斜陽快要落山的時候，太陽可以放心，魚也易於受　。我往往喜歡揀兩種地方垂釣，一種是底下舖　　黃沙的　溪，一種是急湍深　。前者取其靜得安恬後者取其動得雄壯。</p>
<p>溪邊又極富詩趣，向周圍眺望一下，碧林嫩草，夾雜少許野花，牛羊成羣，恍如　幅。</p>
<p>不過，一條魚掉在沙灘上掙扎的時候，卻是一件使人不高興的事情，每次空竿而歸，也不失　涵養性情的良法。最好幾時能買隻玻璃缸，釣幾尾養養，細薄肥魚，該是多麼有趣的事？</p>
<h3>賦別</h3>
<p>— 淦閣</p>
<p>舟橫渡，乍見故國風雲漸次　入天　；此去海外，將不復再見古剎的塔尖。人道是：『別時容易見時難。』安知我不能立即駕　歸來，默默地再瞻仰一番　來吾佛的雄偉呢？但　藍色的海水，倒映下天邊的彩霞時，乍見海鷗翱翔上下，　　　觀音的寶珠，緊隨不捨地，遠遠別送。</p>
<h3>五月</h3>
<p>— 符泊</p>
<p>五月，榴花又紅了！</p>
<p>節，我也曾迷戀過，我也像一般年靑人一樣，有過像　花一樣紅的火焰，在這火焰的燃燒裏，我也曾有過充滿着　　，充滿着熱情的生活。</p>
<p>然而，在榴花幾度凋謝後又盛開了的今天，我已經泯滅了那紅紅的火焰，我抑止了我的希望，我冷卻了我的熱情。</p>
<p>迷人的　風，不能再活躍起我的心，可是詩意的黃昏，又使我重擷起往日的　痕，我用眼淚代替了無底的愁思。</p>
<p>我問　——知道我滄桑的朋友：「情的事，我倒底做錯了沒有？」</p>
<p>「沒有錯，只是害了她，苦了你。」</p>
<p>是的，只是害了她，苦了我自己：</p>
<p>四年前，在某　，我受了創作，從鬥戰的陣綫上退回到家鄉，　為了看護我也跟了我回來；負着苦痛，在友愛的滋潤裏，我度過兩次　人的五月，　就把青春埋葬在我的病房裏。</p>
<p>然而，我明白她還有榴花般青年的心情，她還有一　戰鬥的　　，我何忍折斷了她的翅羽？於是。由　的帮助，我拭着淚放了她，再把她送上征程。</p>
<p>但，在她翱翔在自由的空氣裏的第二年，她把生命殉了國家，是我害了她，是我送她去的……。</p>
<p>從此，藏着流不完的懺悔之淚，像枯萎的榴花，我沒有了希望，沒有了熱情，也失去了青春。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛　（三九）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>墨太太的這種宿命論　　，使翁二太太起初很詫異，因為她記憶中的　太太，一向是有主張，有見地的，而今天她竟然也變了，變得思慮多，變得軟弱，接着又　墨太太也談到她的滿腹　　，才明白，墨太太也是為了墨老仰的死，　　的抗命，內心深深受到　　，所以人生觀不似往常那麼積極了！一個人，如果感情上經過多次的　　以後，是會失去自信的！墨太太現在就是這樣。儘管　太太如今不像從前那樣能夠替翁二太太作主張，但翁二太太也還　需要她的安慰！安慰就是增長她生活勇氣的一種力量。翁二太太如今的環境，也不像從前。從前的環境，翁二太太必須征服；墨太太便作了她「征服環境」的指揮官。如今的環境，翁二太太只能適應，於是墨太太正該教她以安命自如之　！總之，墨太太在翁二太太的精神領域　，一直是一個領導者的地位，墨太太對於翁二太太的影響實在太大了。不過，翁二太太也同樣能夠影響墨太太。</p>
<p>當老得起勁的時候，外間屋裏的　華和　　小姊妹也正玩兒得起勁。他們對於這個新環境開始感覺興趣。特別是麗雲，她看着這屋裏的一切都非常喜悅，而　華却是充滿了好奇。他們觀　　那牆壁上，掛滿了的各　各　的　裝照片，麗雲能辨認得出那照片上的人是石王樓，而麗華就　無印像。也正因為這個原故，麗華十分地感到好奇。</p>
<p>『他是一個男人？』麗華半信半疑地問麗雲。</p>
<p>『嗯，他是一個男人，他唱戲的時候可　像一個女人。不但他穿這些女人衣裳，而且連說話的聲音，和走路的神氣，都同女人一樣。』記憶麗雲從中描敘石玉樓給麗華聽，她很得意，她知道的比麗華多。</p>
<p>『實在太奇怪了！』麗華說罷，頓了一會。忽然又天真的問麗雲：『現在你媽媽就和這奇怪的人住在一起嗎？他也是你的爸爸嗎？』</p>
<p>『這，這我不知道。』</p>
<p>麗雲回答不出了，她受窘地連忙岔開題目，她引導麗華再去　胡琴，和那些槍，刀，弓，劍之類的東西。她對於這些不明白的問題，并不去思慮。不像麗華，她會對於這些不明白的問題屑屑在小心眼裏忖度個不休。</p>
<p>就在這時候，那個奇怪的人，出現於小姊妹的面前了。</p>
<p>石玉樓從戲園子裏回來，乍見這兩個孩子有些愕然，繼而認出了麗雲，心裏便知道是墨太太他們到了。</p>
<p>『小雲，你還認得我不？』石玉樓撫着麗雲的頭說。</p>
<p>『認得！』麗雲說罷，就笑着告訴『麗華　！華姐，就是他啊！』</p>
<p>『什麼就是我呀？』石玉樓看着這對天真的孩子，自己也好笑了。</p>
<p>『那照片上的人就是你，對不對？』麗雲指着牆壁上的劇照問石玉樓。</p>
<p>『對！你真聰明！你怎麼能認得出那是我呢？』</p>
<p>『因為我看過你唱戲，你唱戲的時候就是這個樣兒。』麗雲說，毫不拘束地像和石玉樓很熟稔似的。</p>
<p>麗華一聲不哼，只注意地瞧着石玉樓，她沒有看過石玉樓的　，所以她簡直不能夠相信麗雲剛才告訴她的話是事實。因為現在站在她面前的，石玉樓，一點也不像女人。</p>
<p>『她是誰？』石玉樓看見麗華在一邊發楞，便問麗雲。</p>
<p>『她就是我的乾女兒！』翁二太太接着回答了，一面從裏間屋裏　了　太太出來。</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen and Others Meet with Marshall; Current Situation Being Discussed; Representatives of the Democratic League and Political Consultative Conference Arrive in Beijing from Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, and Minister of Transportation, Yu Dawei, met with Special Envoy Marshall for about an hour at noon on the 28th. It is reported that the content of the talks was related to the ceasefire in Northeast China. Special Envoy Marshall may meet with the representatives of the Democratic League who have just arrived in Beijing from Shanghai in the next few days.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng, in his speech at the memorial week yesterday, reviewed the current situation and said that according to the current situation, the trend of the overall situation is still no more than "peace," "war," and "delay." However, if we want complete peace to be truly realized, we must abide by the ceasefire agreement, restore transportation, and reorganize the army in accordance with the army reorganization plan to show sincerity for peace. Chen also said: Given the current situation of the country and the suffering of the people, the overall situation really cannot afford to be dragged on.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Reliable sources: If the Communist army abandons its attempt to seize Northeast China by force and voluntarily withdraws from Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places, the government will still uphold its original intention of being magnanimous and may temporarily designate the territory of Xing'an Province as a defense zone for the Communist army and provide certain conveniences to allow the Communist army to engage in army reorganization in accordance with the army reorganization plan. As for political issues in Northeast China, national sovereignty and the opinions of the people of Northeast China should be respected. After the government completes the takeover work and establishes popular opinion organizations, it will handle matters in accordance with the law and resolutely opposes specialization. Xing'an Province is adjacent to the Soviet Union and Mongolia to the west, and borders Heilongjiang to the north and northeast, and Liaobei Province and Chahar to the east and south. It covers an area of ​​more than 249,000 square kilometers and governs six counties, including Hulun, Luyan, Qigan, Yalu, Shiwei, and Buxi, as well as the Solun Administration Bureau, with Hulun (i.e., Hailar) as the provincial capital. The current chairman of the Xing'an Provincial Government appointed by the National Government is Wu Huanzhang.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Junmai, and other five representatives of the Democratic League and Political Consultative Conference arrived in Beijing from Shanghai at 2 p.m. on the 28th. Qi Yanming, Secretary-General of the Communist Party delegation, Ye Duyi of the Democratic League Office, and Wang Tongye of the Political Council all went to the station to welcome them. After the five representatives got off the train, they went to the No. 15 Lanjiagang residence to rest. They issued a written statement to reporters, stating: The civil war in Northeast China is a rare tragedy in many years. The Democratic League, the Youth Party, and the non-partisan representatives of the Political Consultative Conference unanimously demand a ceasefire and are willing to work together with all parties to promote peace. Luo Longji telegraphed the Democratic League office in Beijing today, saying that he will fly to Beijing tomorrow. According to well-informed sources, once the representatives of the various parties gather in Beijing, a preparatory meeting of the Political Consultative Conference will be held to exchange opinions and jointly seek the realization of peace.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The domestic situation seems unlikely to have bright prospects within a week. A certain observer told reporters that although the rainstorm has passed, the dark clouds have not yet dissipated. A prolonged stalemate may lead to the clouds clearing and the sky brightening, or it may brew a new rainstorm. Chairman Chiang's stay in Shenyang has reached its sixth day, and there is still no news of his return to the south. Now it is rumored that the Chairman will go to Changchun tomorrow for inspection. All of this is enough to show the government's firm determination to take over sovereignty in Northeast China. On the Communist side, they believe that withdrawing from Changchun is already their concession. They are afraid that it will be difficult for them to accept the case of withdrawing from Harbin. Regarding the transportation issue, the government insists that a ceasefire must first restore transportation, while the Communist side insists that a ceasefire must come before discussing the restoration of transportation. There is still a considerable distance between the two sides' opinions. If this distance does not gradually shorten, Marshal Marshall seems unlikely to go to Shenyang. Because if he goes to Shenyang, he can only succeed and not fail, and he will certainly not want to make a futile trip. The observer pointed out that the situation within Shanhaiguan is also not to be taken lightly. The flames of war in Jilu, Subei, and eastern Henan may be rekindled at any time.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] Zhang Junmai said: There is considerable hope for a peaceful solution. Since the National Army recovered Changchun, there has been no real war in Northeast China. In fact, the war has already stopped. As long as the situation in Northeast China is resolved, everything else will naturally be resolved accordingly. The three-point proposal for peace in Northeast China proposed by the Democratic League may need to be revised to suit the situation. The Communist side seems quite willing to stop fighting.</p>
<h3>The Central Government Orders Active Restoration of the Two Major Trunk Lines of Pinghan and Jinpu; The Houma Group Discusses the Restoration of the Tongpu Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The local transportation authorities have received a telegram from the Central Government, ordering the active restoration of the two major trunk lines of Pinghan and Jinpu.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th] After the government representative of the Marshall Group, Shen Guofu, and the American representative, Lun Tai'er, paid a visit to Governor Yan at noon on the 27th, they discussed the restoration of transportation on the Shicun-Yuncheng section of the southern Tongpu Line. It is reported that after Lun gave a frank report on his collection of the Communist side's opinions on the restoration of the road, he solicited the government's opinions. Finally, it was decided that the People's Public Enterprise Association would take over the Tongpu Road as a people's public enterprise, and the transportation agencies of the Communist side would each send personnel to Linfen to directly discuss it. The group will supervise it in accordance with Order No. 4 of Hezi. According to reporters, the Communist side requested that the government provide materials for the repair of the road, and the Communist side would control the railway management rights.</p>
<h3>The Military Mediation Department Will Strengthen Mediation Work in Northeast China</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The Military Mediation Department is now preparing to strengthen mediation work in Northeast China. If an agreement on Northeast China is reached in the short term, the Military Mediation Department will send additional groups to work. At present, the work of the Northeast Executive Group is also expected to gradually unfold. The 28th Group has already departed from Kaiyuan for Sipingjie, and the 8th Group may go to Changchun. However, the issue of sending a group to Harbin has not yet been agreed upon by the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>The Devastation of Dajian Gou Village; No Sign of Human Life; Representatives from All Sectors of Jinan Go to Inspect</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 28th] Dajian Gou Village, after being plundered by the Communist army, is full of devastation. Nine out of ten houses are empty, and there is no sign of human life. No less than a thousand people from nearby villages were brutally killed by the Communist army. All sectors of Jinan are outraged by the Communist army's heinous atrocities. More than 20 representatives from Jinan's news media and various people's organizations rushed to Dajian Gou on the 27th to inspect. The village is more than 30 miles south of Jinan and is located at the southern foot of Xinglong Mountain. There were more than 1,000 households in the village. After the Communist army's massacre on May 18, only a few weak and disabled villagers remain in the village. When reporters and inspectors entered the village, dozens of villagers were lying prostrate among the rubble on the side of the road, crying and complaining, which was unbearable to hear. Among them was an 80-year-old man named Ma Naigang, whose son was killed by the Communist army and two grandsons were taken away by the Communist army. He beat his chest and wailed, almost fainting. Chen Zhongde, a 64-year-old villager, had stab wounds on his head and abdomen. Zhang Jingzhou, a 74-year-old, became insane because his house was burned down by the Communist army and his property was destroyed. Every day, he carries a wooden fork he found in the ashes and wanders around the village, muttering to himself, crying and laughing erratically. When he saw the reporter, he said that the farmhouse he had painstakingly managed since the 28th year of Guangxu had now been reduced to ashes, and all that remained was this half of a wooden fork. After he finished speaking, he laughed wildly, then wailed to the sky. After being comforted, he staggered away. According to the temporary village chief, in mid-May, more than 100 refugees from villages in the southern suburbs of Jinan passed through here. Because the road was blocked, they temporarily lived in the area east of the ditch in the village. At 9 p.m. on the 18th, when the Communist army attacked the village, all these 100+ people were killed. Some of the bodies were tied with huge stones and thrown into the well. Most of the bodies were taken away by the Communist army when they retreated in the morning of the 19th in order to reduce traces. Several days later, the entire village was still filled with the stench of corpses and blood. According to statistics, from the 16th to the 19th, about 400 to 500 people were known to have been killed in the village and the nearby Dianzi, Liangxianggou, Houjia Village, Yigong, and the Quanlu, Laopogou, Xicun, Fujia Village, and Xixianzhen and Zhujia Village southwest of Huangluxian, which are more than ten miles to the south. More than 600 people were captured and their whereabouts are unknown. In addition to the more than 30 bodies left under the West Mountain of Dajian Gou and the more than 20 bodies recovered from the well, the remains of the rest could not be found. Twenty-six houses in the village were burned down. According to the National Army stationed in the area, the Communist army that attacked the village was the "4th Division of the 4th Army," with more than 2,000 soldiers of Kong's "regiment," well-equipped. Its artillerymen and machine gunners were all Japanese. After retreating, the Communist army is still hiding near Menger Mountain, which is more than ten miles west of the village.</p>
<h3>Soviet Relations with the CCP Are Not Good</h3>
<p>[United Press, Changchun, 28th] After the reporter met with six prominent figures among the 160 Soviets here, I had the impression that the relationship between the Soviet and CCP personnel were not as good as expected by outsiders. During the five weeks the CCP occupied Changchun, according to these Soviets, they looted the Chinese, and also robbed Soviet people. Once, the Communist army forcibly requisitioned the building of the Soviet Foreign Trade Bureau in Changchun. When the Soviets refused, the Communists rudely told them: "Since you only deal with the central government, please contact the central government directly about this house." These Soviets claimed that based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Moscow only recognized the government led by Chairman Chiang, which made the Communist regime in Yan'an lose face.</p>
<h3>Xiong Bin Will Fly to Beijing Soon to Attend the Financial and Food Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] Beiping Mayor Xiong Bin told reporters that the central government decided to convene a financial and food conference in Beijing on June 6, ordering the chairmen of all provinces, directly-administered mayors, and directors of finance of all provinces and cities to attend at that time. Mayor Xiong and Director of Finance Fu Zhengshun will fly to Beijing in the near future.</p>
<h3>Ou Zhen Summoned to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] General Ou Zhen, Commander-in-Chief of the 10th Army Group, has been summoned from Jiujiang to Beijing. He is a famous general who has fought in the Hunan-Jiangxi battlefields and made great contributions in the battles of Changsha and Hengyang.</p>
<h3>The Four Chairmen of Jilin, Hejiang, Heilongjiang, and Xing'an Provinces Arrived in Shenyang from Beiping; The Northeast Branch of the Executive Yuan Will Move to Changchun</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 28th] The transportation takeover work in Northeast China is progressing rapidly. Due to insufficient personnel, 160 people were transferred from Beiping. They passed through Tianjin at noon on the 28th and went to Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] Liu Guangpei, Director of the Northeast Branch of the Executive Yuan, recently sent Li Shaoyuan, a senior inspector of the branch, and many staff members to Changchun to handle emergency relief for refugees and prepare for the relocation of the branch to Changchun.</p>
<h3>The Chairman and His Wife Personally Visit the Hospital to Comfort Wounded Officers and Soldiers; Zhang Daofan and Others Summoned to Arrive in Shenyang from Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] A certain important person said at a cocktail party hosted by Cai Wenzhi to welcome Ambassador Gu Weijun today: Chairman Chiang will fly from Shenyang to Changchun tomorrow. The Chairman telegraphed Nanjing yesterday, ordering Zhang Daofan, Zheng Xinfen, Gu Zhengding, and others to fly directly to Shenyang today, to give instructions. Zhang and others passed through Beiping at noon today, met with Beiping Mayor Xiong Bin at Nanyuan Airport, and after having some food and drink, continued to fly to Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] It is heard that the Chairman has been giving detailed instructions on important political affairs in Northeast China for several days in Shenyang. Now four important government officials, Zhang Daofan, etc., have flown to Shenyang in response to the summons in preparation for the inquiries.

<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] Central Committee members Zhang Daofan, Zheng Yanfen, and Gu Zhengding arrived in Shenyang from Beijing at noon on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] Chairman Chiang and his wife went to the 91st Rear Hospital at 4:30 p.m. on the 28th to comfort the officers and soldiers wounded in the takeover of the Sipingjie and Changchun areas, for more than an hour. They then went to the Shengjing Hospital to comfort Zhao Linjing, the wounded division commander of Liaoyang. At 9 p.m., he summoned Lin Kesheng, Director of the Military Medical Department, and gave instructions. In the 91st Rear Hospital, the Chairman and his wife asked each wounded officer and soldier about their injuries and suffering after the injury, and ordered the hospital to prepare fruit for the seriously wounded soldiers and pay attention to nutrition so that they could recover their health as soon as possible. When Madame Chiang Kai-shek saw that the soldiers had no bed sheets, she often ordered the hospital to purchase them for washing, and instructed the nurses to pay attention to maintaining cleanliness. Some soldiers were moved to tears when they saw the Supreme Commander and his wife personally come to comfort them. When the reporter asked a soldier who was crying what his pain was, he said: There is no pain, but he could not help but cry because he had survived nine deaths and received the comfort of the commander-in-chief and his wife. After leaving the 91st Rear Hospital, the Chairman and his wife went to the Shengjing City Hospital to comfort Zhao Linjing, the division commander of the 91st Division, and told him to take good care of himself, and gave him several apples that the Executive Yuan had prepared for the Chairman and his wife, repeatedly telling him to take care and then left. When leaving the hospital, the entire staff and students of the hospital's affiliated nursing school lined up to ask for instructions. The Chairman encouraged them to study hard and serve the country.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] The 27th was the first day that Chairman Chiang ordered the establishment of a secret complaint box to receive letters of complaint from the people. A total of five letterboxes were set up, and each was guarded by a dedicated person. After the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan announced the method for the people to file complaints, the people of Shenyang welcomed and were grateful. On the 27th, the five secret complaint boxes received a total of 36 letters.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Madame Chiang Kai-shek summoned Zhao Churuiyan and other preparatory members of the Northeast Branch of the Women's Guidance Committee on the 27th and gave three points of instructions on the work of the women's movement in Northeast China: (1) Launch campaigns to comfort wounded soldiers; (2) Strive to eliminate illiteracy among women; (3) Conscientiously promote childcare.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Welcomes Ju Zheng</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 28th] President Ju returned to his hometown from Shanghai on the Jiang'an ship. He is expected to arrive here this afternoon. All agencies have decided to host a banquet tonight to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Promulgates Austerity Measures; To Be Implemented from June 1</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 28th] The Wuhan Executive Headquarters recently promulgated austerity implementation measures. From June 1, all extravagant and licentious behaviors will be strictly inspected and banned. The slogans set include the warning "Waste is poverty for the people."</p>
<h3>Rumor of Chen Jiazhen's Suicide</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 28th] General Chen Jiazhen, the former commander of the Changchun Garrison, reportedly committed suicide after being captured by the Communist army. Chen was transferred to Harbin by the Communist army two days before the National Army recovered Changchun. It is suspected that the suicide took place on the way from Changchun to Harbin, or in Harbin.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Order Carefully Issued by the Military Mediation Department</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] It has been widely rumored in Beijing for days that negotiations on a ceasefire, through the constant mediation of Special Envoy Marshall, have resulted in a partial agreement, and a ceasefire order will be issued soon. This newspaper's reporter believes that this move is worthy of attention, and has consulted various parties on this matter. It is reported that, given the recent situation in various places, the number of conflict incidents within Shanhaiguan has indeed decreased day by day, but the Communist army north of the Yangtze River is still frequently mobilized, and the situation is still not too optimistic. The American and government representatives of the Military Mediation Department, in view of the fact that previous ceasefire orders and road resumption orders have rarely been effective, have adopted an extremely cautious attitude towards the issuance of orders to avoid losing credibility. The rumor that the ceasefire order will be issued today or tomorrow is a bit premature.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 28th] All newspapers in Beiping today unanimously published on the front page news that the "Big Three" of China have signed a ceasefire agreement in Northeast China in Nanjing. The Xinmin Daily reported that the agreement was signed yesterday in Nanjing and will be officially issued within days. The Yishi Daily said that Du Yuming's troops, "for the sake of peace," have ordered their troops to stop advancing towards Harbin and Jilin.</p>
<h3>National Army Recovers Yongji and Panshi; Communist Army Concentrates in Qiqihar</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] According to a senior general, after the National Army recovered Changchun, it could have taken Jilin and Heilongjiang in one fell swoop, but because the government sincerely wants to peacefully take over Harbin so that the Communist army can retreat calmly and the people of Jilin and Heilongjiang can suffer less pain, the important strongholds within 90 li to the east, west, and north of Changchun's periphery, such as Jiutai, Wanbaoshan, Yongji, Hailong, and Dehui, have indeed been gradually taken over by the National Army. The National Army's recovery of Hailong, which is only 85 li from Jilin, has continued to progress yesterday. If there are no obstacles along the way, it will reach the outskirts of Harbin as early as tonight or at the latest tomorrow night.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] A person from Shenyang said today: The National Army in Changchun continues to consolidate its peripheral advances. One route has crossed Wanbaoshan, where a tragic incident occurred before September 18, and another route is advancing rapidly along the Jichang Road, having crossed Jiutai. Yongji, the capital of Jilin Province, will be captured soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] Our accompanying reporter in Yongji telegraphed at 3 p.m. on the 28th. The National Army completely recovered Yongji, the capital of Jilin Province, and Panshi to its south at 4 p.m. on the 28th. The Communist army fled eastward and northward from Yongji. Order was immediately restored in Yongji after the National Army moved in, and the lights were turned on at night. The Xiaofengman Power Plant may have been occupied by the National Army (Note: Xiaofengman is one of the largest power plants in Northeast China, supplying a very wide area. If it is recovered, it will be of great benefit to the power supply in Northeast China).</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] Liaoyuan, 26th Telegram, The 91st Division of the 71st Army on the left wing of the National Army crossed Liaoyuan and continued to advance north</p>
<p>Wolongtun, 20 kilometers from Liaoyuan, was recovered. The place was defended by the 1st and 2nd regiments of the Communist Security Forces. After a fierce attack by the division, the Communist army was defeated and retreated to the northwest. In this battle, 41 Communist soldiers were captured, including two Japanese.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 28th] The National Army continues to advance towards Harbin and Jilin. It is heard that the Communist army in Harbin has crossed the Songhua River and concentrated in Qiqihar. It is expected that the National Army advancing towards Jilin will reach its destination earlier than the National Army advancing towards Harbin.</p>
<h3>The Allied Reparations Committee Will Establish a Branch in Shenyang; Meier Flies to Shenyang to Prepare for Pauley</h3>

According to the plan, 240 billion yuan is needed, and Yichang can become a metropolis with a population of 3 million in the future.</p>
<h3>Principal Japanese War Criminal Sakai Takashi Indicted by Army Headquarters Military Tribunal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The number of war criminals delivered and detained by various parties to the Military Tribunal of the Army Headquarters for the Trial of War Criminals has recently increased to over thirty. The military prosecutors have interrogated them one by one and telegraphed relevant parties to collect evidence of the crimes committed by each. It is reported that the important war criminal Sakai Takashi has been investigated by Prosecutor Chen and indicted. A public trial will soon be held at the Military Tribunal of the Army Headquarters at Gongzi Hall. The following is a summary of the indictment against the accused: Defendant Sakai Takashi, age 60, from Hiroshima Prefecture, military officer.</p>
<p>Facts of the Crime: (4) Sakai Takashi was a young and vigorous member of the Japanese military. He was promoted from second lieutenant to lieutenant general, dedicating his life to the movement of aggression against our country. In the eighth year of the Republic [1919], he was dispatched to China, serving successively as a military attaché and assistant official at the Japanese Legation in Beijing, a member of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, an assistant official to Lieutenant Colonel Akimura, a military attaché stationed in Hankou, commander of the infantry regiment of the Tianjin Garrison, chief of staff of the China Garrison Army, attached to the Kwantung Army Headquarters, director-general of the Asia Development Board Liaison Department, and commander of the 23rd Army. He was, along with Doihara Kenji and Umezu Yoshijiro, a key figure in implementing Japan's policy of aggression. In the political arena, he oppressed or induced local officials to reject our central government and its political power in the North China and Inner Mongolia areas, attempting to create puppet governments under his control and occupation of our national territory. In the economic arena, he interfered with our relevant administration, engaged in large-scale armed smuggling, and used various military and political advantages to traffic in large quantities of narcotics, poisoning our people in order to eliminate their resistance capability. He used military force as the main pillar, first threatening with military might, and when no pretext was created, he temporarily used military force to coerce our military and political authorities to accept his various harsh conditions, and afterwards, he again used military force to compel their strict enforcement, and continued to create new facts, step by step encroaching, leading to the July 7th Incident [Marco Polo Bridge Incident]. When this large-scale war of aggression broke out, he then served as brigade commander, army commander, and attached to the Kwantung Army Headquarters, engaging in the war of aggression, fighting battles in the north and south of our country. On December 8th of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], taking advantage of the unpreparedness of the British army in Hong Kong, our allied nation, he attacked and captured Hong Kong. During this war of aggression, he instigated his subordinates to violate international treaties and customs, implementing various atrocities: (1) Massacring large numbers of innocent Chinese and British people; (2) Inflicting torture on civilians; (3) Rape; (4) Enslaving or depriving the people of occupied areas of their civil rights; (5) Wantonly destroying property. Furthermore, he transported three hundred boxes of books from the Fung Ping Shan Library of the University of Hong Kong, one hundred and eleven boxes of rare books and paintings from the National Central Library, and twenty boxes of Western books stored in the Wing On Godown in Hong Kong to the Tokyo General Staff Headquarters and Shanghai. In addition, he created a puppet regime in Guangzhou and organized a puppet peace army, implementing the vicious policy of using Chinese to control Chinese, intending to overthrow our government, instigating the traitorous elements to occupy national territory, and eliminate our resistance capability, in order to swallow up our country and then dominate the world. His consistent actions in implementing the policy of aggression against China continued until after Japan's surrender.</p>
<p>Evidence of the Crime: (1) The defendant engaged in espionage work; (2) He engaged in aggression in various aspects such as military, political, and economic affairs; (3) He launched a war of aggression; (4) He presided over various atrocities. All have evidence and the defendant's confession records during the investigation period to prove them. The defendant cannot be separated from Japan's entire policy of aggression and acts of aggression. Not only should he bear criminal responsibility for the atrocities directly connected to himself, but he should also bear responsibility for all crimes arising from this policy of aggression that do not violate his original intentions. He damaged peace, extinguished humanity, and violated international treaties and laws, truly a heinous crime, with conclusive evidence and no room for denial.</p>

<p>[Another Dispatch] The issue of salary adjustment, which all public school teachers and staff across the country eagerly desire, was not brought up for discussion at the Executive Yuan routine meeting on the 28th. Only several cases of appointing vice ministers of the Ministry of Economic Affairs were passed. It is reported that the suggestions of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans regarding the adjustment of civil servant salaries have been delivered to the Executive Yuan, but the Executive Yuan has not yet formulated concrete measures, so it was not brought up for discussion on the 28th.

Internally, he issued residence permits to restrict the activities of our central underground workers, and externally, he scouted our military, political, and economic intelligence, assisting the enemy's aggression. In November of the 32nd year [1943], he filled the position of President of the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company. In March of the 34th year [1945], he became a standing member of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Commission and the chairman of the North China Cooperative Enterprise General Society, robbing our economic resources and supplying the enemy's military use.

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] The Allied Control Council for Japan will hold its fifth meeting tomorrow. According to this reporter's observation, there are various reasons to believe that the holding of this meeting seems likely to be the prelude to an effort to "completely overthrow the Allied Committee," and it is believed that the committee will begin to take practical steps to implement its original purpose, that is, to review and advise MacArthur's work in the occupation. Superficially, the effect of the previous four meetings in obtaining constructive results was very small.</p>

<h3>The Knot of International Politics Stuck in a Stalemate: After Reading Molotov's Speech</h3>
<p>The four deputy foreign ministers have been meeting again in Paris since yesterday to carry out all the preparatory work for the next four foreign ministers conference. According to the final decision of the last four foreign ministers conference, it is planned to reopen the four foreign ministers conference on June 15 to decide on the date of the convocation of the European twenty-one nation and conference, which must not be later than the end of July; therefore, the four deputy foreign ministers conference held in Paris has once again become the focus of world attention. However, what is the future of the international conferences to be convened in the coming months? It will depend on the attitudes of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. In the last four foreign ministers conference, because the opinions of the Soviet Union and the United States were divided, each insisted on their own opinions and refused to give in, resulting in a stalemate, which led to the breakdown of the conference. Afterwards, both sides issued statements and shirked responsibility to each other, and even slandered each other, which made us dare not be optimistic about the future of the next foreign ministers conference.</p>
<p>First, US Secretary of State Byrnes returned home and delivered a radio address to the people of the country, reporting on the proceedings of the four foreign ministers conference; and solemnly declared the foreign policy of the United States, saying: "Our pursuit of peace can only be regarded as just beginning. We are determined to fight to the end for the political and economic peace of Europe, the Near East, and other regions. We will continue this work in peace conferences or in the various councils of the United Nations. Our goal is not to seek territory or reparations for the United States, but to seek peace for the whole world. The world must know that peace can hardly be built on the basis of revenge and greed. Only peace based on justice and public reason can be maintained for a long time." In his tone, he placed the responsibility for the failure of the four foreign ministers conference entirely on the Soviet Union. At that time, the Soviet government did not respond, but only published an article in the Soviet New Era magazine, attacking the British and American governments for tending towards power politics and adopting "atomic diplomacy"; and said that the attitude of the British and American representatives in the four foreign ministers conference towards the most sensitive issues was not based on the true interests of the survival of the countries concerned, nor on international security and lasting peace, nor on the intention to protect the interests of some small countries; but their intentions were elsewhere, which was the main reason for the failure of the Paris foreign ministers conference.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union are diametrically opposed, unable to get close; and they are mutually contradictory, escalating, and endless. Although international political commentators are shouting for the Soviet Union to understand and appealing for US-Soviet cooperation, they have never been able to reverse the adverse currents between the two countries. For example, in the United States, some people have launched the establishment of the US-Soviet Association, seeking mutual understanding from mutual understanding; some people advocate lending money to the Soviet Union, seeking political understanding from economic cooperation; and even some people advocate concluding a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union, using the treaty to guarantee the friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union. Former Undersecretary of State Welles also said: "The failure of the Paris foreign ministers conference was due to the failure of the United States and the Soviet Union to agree on the basic nature of the future new world order. Today's world is shrouded in the sorrow of fear and suspicion, because there is a lack of constructive leaders among the countries, which makes the clouds thicker. The Soviet Union attempts to expand its defense areas, and recognizes this as the only practical sense of security. The United States should make a final effort to make the Soviet Union believe that only by adopting a "One World" policy can its security be guaranteed." But what effect do these actions and expressions of the United States have on the Soviet Union? All those who long for the post-war world to enter a new era of democratic peace hope that the United States and the Soviet Union can truly reach an understanding, so as to establish world peace on a solid foundation; therefore, what is the true intention of the Soviet Union? It is more urgently needed to thoroughly understand. Marshal Stalin's speeches on May Day and Victory Day on May 9 did not satisfy our desires; but the speech made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to reporters from Pravda the day before yesterday clarified the Soviet Union's true intentions towards the outside world.</p>
<p>Molotov's speech had three meanings: (1) The Soviet Union still adheres to its original position on the attitude towards the peace conference; that is, the twenty-one nation peace conference cannot be convened until the four major powers have reached a preliminary agreement on the European peace treaty; that is, it opposes the proposal of US Secretary of State Byrnes: "When the four foreign ministers conference fails to reach an agreement, the issue of the European peace treaty will be submitted to the United Nations mechanism for discussion." And he denounced this proposal as a violation of the Potsdam Declaration. (2) The Soviet Union still holds an uncompromising attitude towards Britain and the United States. Molotov not only condemned Britain and the United States for dealing with the Soviet Union with threats and intimidation, but also said that Britain and the United States launched an offensive against the Soviet Union in the four foreign ministers conference. The United States, with the support of Britain, wanted to set up naval and air bases everywhere in the world, attempting to impose its will on other countries. (3) Britain and the United States used economic assistance as a means to try to control Italy and other countries, making them tools for promoting capitalist policies: therefore, Britain and the United States should be responsible for the failure of the Paris foreign ministers conference.</p>
<p>Molotov's speech was straightforward, frank, and unceremonious. He attacked the US diplomatic policy, almost to the point of escorting the driving carriage, disregarding diplomatic rhetoric and etiquette; it can be seen that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States has reached the stage of close combat; even diplomatic courtesies are no longer needed. Looking forward to the reopening of the four foreign ministers in Paris on June 15, the prospect is even more bleak. Not only is the European peace conference postponed indefinitely, but even if it is convened, it is difficult to have a satisfactory result. If the international situation continues to stalemate like this, if there is no way to break the stalemate, there will never be world peace, and the security of all countries will be even less guaranteed. We have to worry about the future of the entire world. However, the crux of today's international problems lies in the irreconcilable contradiction between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States, and the confrontation between the two major blocs is becoming more and more undisguised. In the eyes of sharp-eyed political diplomats, they should be able to see it clearly; how to reverse the adverse currents of today's international politics? The first is to eliminate the suspicion and contradiction between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. Ideologically, the Soviet Union is a socialist country, and Britain and the United States are capitalist countries, just like water and fire are incompatible, and there seems to be no room for compromise; but there are many common points between communism and democracy. We can just study these common points, explore each other, and understand each other, so as to avoid the deepening of mutual doubts. In fact, the Soviet Union, for its own security, is desperately expanding its "circle of friends" to enhance its "sense of security"; making Britain and the United States feel uneasy. This is because Britain and the United States, for the sake of world security, also want to set up naval and air bases everywhere in the world, and keep the secrets of atomic energy, refusing to disclose them, in order to consolidate the foundation of world peace; the Soviet Union also feels the threat from Britain and the United States. Therefore, the two sides attack each other, suspect each other, and cannot control themselves. No matter how you explain it? It is always impossible to make the suspicions of both sides completely dispel. In fact, what both sides need most is peace, and the second is also peace; if they can immediately restore the friendly spirit during the war, cooperate sincerely, and jointly rebuild world peace, it is what both sides are seeking day and night. Therefore, from this point of view, it is not impossible to persuade the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States to release their grievances and reconcile.</p>
<p>In short, the knot of today's international stalemate lies entirely in the irreconcilability between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. If we want to break the current stalemate, if we want to reverse the adverse currents of the international situation, we must seek understanding and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. It is useless to convene international conferences blindly. Looking at a series of international conferences after the war, either they are discussed but not decided, or they are decided but not implemented. Not a single one has not failed. It can be seen that convening international conferences again will still not break the current stalemate. For the current plan, the only way is to find a way to seek understanding and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States; the most important thing is to stop the "propaganda war" between the two sides, so as to avoid stimulating the emotions and nerves of the people on both sides.</p>

<h3>French Army Invades Border Incident: Siam Decides to Appeal to the Security Council, America Sends Personnel to Investigate the Incident Location</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 28th Broadcast: The British Foreign Office officially announced tonight: Siam has decided to appeal to the United Nations Security Council, requesting the Security Council to immediately investigate the fact that the French army has invaded and attacked Siamese territory. A British Foreign Office spokesman stated: The British side agrees to include Siam's complaint in the Security Council's agenda.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th Dispatch] A State Department spokesman stated: After the incident on the Siamese-Vietnamese border, we have not yet received definite reports. However, based on the information we have obtained, the French army's intrusion seems to be only a "border incident." Bangkok has dispatched an American observer to inspect the location of the incident. It is reported that the location is not within the land disputed by Siam and Vietnam.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 27th Exclusive Dispatch] News from Bangkok states that although the Siamese government has accused the French army of invading the Siamese border to the Security Council, the United Nations Secretariat has not yet received a report from the Siamese government regarding the French army's invasion. According to Article 25 of the United Nations Charter, although Siam is not a member of the United Nations, it has the right to file a complaint if it declares in advance that it accepts the obligation to peacefully resolve disputes stipulated in the Charter. However, because the United States and Britain are planning to propose Siam's accession to the United Nations soon, Siam's accusation against France this time is causing them anxiety. Therefore, the new dispute between France and Siam may be mediated by the United States and Britain, rather than being included in the Security Council's agenda. A French government spokesman stated at the United Nations today that the French military actions along the Siamese-Vietnamese border were due to the "excessive repulsion" of Siamese who had invaded the Vietnamese border, and the French authorities stationed in Vietnam had repeatedly broadcast warnings to the Siamese government to suppress such attacks, but have failed to do so.</p>
<p>Villages Looted</p>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 27th Dispatch] The Siamese government officially announced tonight that it will submit a detailed report to the United Nations agencies regarding the French army's looting of Siamese villages. The village is located upstream of Long Kai on the Mekong River. At 6:00 AM on Sunday, eighty French soldiers crossed the river to rob one household, and then eight hundred people crossed the river to search and loot the entire village for three hours, leaving only at noon.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Bangkok, 28th Dispatch] According to news from the Siamese-Vietnamese border today, the Siamese police-civilian mixed force has driven out the French army that invaded Taibo City on the Mekong River.</p>
<p>Distant Cause of the Dispute</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 27th Dispatch] A French spokesman stationed at the United Nations agencies said yesterday that the military action that the French side could take on the Siamese-Vietnamese border was due to the Siamese crossing the border into Vietnam to engage in significant provocations. The French authorities in Vietnam repeatedly warned the Siamese side by radio not to engage in such border crossings, but the Siamese government turned a deaf ear. Observers here pointed out that the Siamese-Vietnamese problem occurred as early as 1941, when the Siamese, relying on the power of Japan, invaded and occupied one-fifth of the territory of Vietnam and Cambodia, resulting in fierce battles. On January 28, 1942, Bangkok, Hanoi, and Vichy simultaneously announced that both sides had accepted Japanese mediation, and the war ceased.</p>

<h3>Defense Lawyers for Japanese War Criminals Request the Court to Postpone the Trial</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th Dispatch] The defense lawyers for Japanese war criminals Hideki Tojo and 25 others have requested the International Military Tribunal to postpone the start of the trial, which is scheduled for June 3, arguing that the defendants do not have enough time to present a sufficient defense. It is said that the prosecuting attorneys "have the assistance of hundreds of assistants, investigators, and specialists" to collect evidence for half a year, while the defense lawyers do not have such ample time. The actions of which the defendants are accused occurred over several years, and "mostly involve documents, treaties, and agreements spanning nearly forty years," so they need to be studied in detail.</p>
<h3>Righteous Views from American Newspapers: America Should Deeply Understand Asian History and Culture; The Foundation of Chinese Civilization Endures Through Time; Japanese Civilization is a Branch of Chinese Civilization</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 27th Dispatch] The San Francisco Chronicle published today: "The American people as a whole have a rather superficial understanding of Asia and its complex history, culture, and politics, and it is urgent to have a deeper understanding. Past events have proven that we may engage in wars in Asia, and in this era of tools that can travel thousands of miles in an instant, America and Asia are only an arrow's shot away from each other. In the future, we should know more about the real situation in Asia. American schools all neglect the study of Asia, which is shameful. Their responsibility lies in transforming this neglect into understanding. The Institute of Pacific Relations has dispatched many Far East experts to form a committee to study the textbooks commonly used in American universities. It has found that the part of the world history textbooks that describes Asia accounts for only 7%, the part of the American history textbooks that describes the Far East accounts for only 3%, and the part of the geography textbooks that describes Asia and its hundreds of millions of people accounts for only 10%. According to the report of the Institute of Pacific Relations, general textbooks all have arrogant tones, calling the neighboring countries across the Pacific Ocean inferior and backward countries. Our current task must start from scratch. All textbooks with arrogant tones and those that promote narrow patriotism should be shelved, so that university students can understand the foundation of Chinese civilization and the reasons for its enduring through time, and understand that Japanese civilization is a branch of Chinese civilization, but it has lost its original features, and what exactly are its differences." The newspaper concluded: "If the next generation does not understand Asia more deeply than we do, then the consequences will be unimaginable."</p>

<h3>"Officers" and "Soldiers" Are Collectively Called "Military Personnel"; Standing at Attention and Military Salutes Should Also Be Abolished: Recommendations of the US Army Review Committee</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] The Eastern United States Army held a meeting in Washington, D.C. The Eighth Air Force Commander, famous General Doolittle, served as chairman. Today, he made a recommendation to Army Secretary Patterson, advocating the abolition of the terms "officers" and "soldiers," and collectively calling them "military personnel," so as to eliminate the differences in officialdom and society. So that the soldiers will no longer have grievances about unequal treatment. The differences in pay, promotion, leave, awards, and food that have always existed must also be completely corrected, and military leaders must find ways to improve their standards. Standing at attention and military salutes should be abolished, except when on duty in the military and serving in occupied areas abroad. Any military regulations or military habits that make the hierarchy of official ranks an obstacle to social interaction must also be declared invalid. The committee's review report is 53 pages long, and its conclusion states: "Americans are unhappy with any system that allows a certain class of people to obtain rights without labor, and they also dislike the forced social stratification of the two parts of the military." The report also stated that there are two main reasons for the poor relationship between American officers and soldiers: one is that a small number of non-commissioned officers are leading poorly, and the other is that differences in officialdom and social treatment cause resentment. Regarding the improvement of officer leadership, the committee advocated that all officers who serve as commanders, except for technical personnel, must receive one year of military training. The promotion of officers should be based on merit, not qualifications. Patterson said that some of the recommendations in the report have already been implemented.</p>

<h3>US Two Major Secret Weapons: In Addition to "Germs," There are Also Atomic Poison Gases. Federation of Scientists Requests Details.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Dr. Higinbotham, Chairman of the Federation of American Scientists, declared today at a preparatory meeting of the Federation's Atomic Energy Information Committee that there are currently at least two major secret weapons that scientists believe pose the same danger to humanity as the atomic bomb. One is germs, and the other is so-called atomic poison gas. Dr. Higinbotham did not disclose details about the two secret weapons, but stated that, for the sake of peace, Congress should request the War Department to disclose details about the two secret weapons. Atomic bombs can have passive defenses, such as evacuating cities and factories at a cost of $300 billion, but germ warfare can be used to cut off the people's food supply, and materials with radioactive energy can endanger civilians hiding in air-raid shelters.

<h3>Chairman's Concern for Shanghai Residents' Food Supply: Handwritten Instructions to Thoroughly Investigate Causes of Rapid Price Increases. Anyone Found Manipulating or Hoarding Will be Executed. Authorities Reviewing Loaned Rice Dealers' Accounts.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to reliable sources, Chairman Chiang is extremely angered by the recent unwarranted surge in rice prices in this city and has issued handwritten instructions to relevant parties in this city to thoroughly investigate the underlying causes of the price increases. He is paying particular attention to artificial manipulation and hoarding. If any illegal elements are found to be using their special positions and relationships to manipulate prices, they will be executed upon verification of the facts. It is heard that the relevant parties have been making intensive inquiries and investigations in recent days, aiming to eradicate artificial manipulation and hoarding. It is expected that an announcement will soon be made to the four million residents of this city, to the delight of the people.</p>
<p>According to the Grain Administration, the processing and accounts of the 16 rice dealers who received grain loans are currently being reviewed by the Grain Loan Review Committee. Accountants will be collectively invited to inspect the accounts. Therefore, a detailed report on the entire process before and after the grain loans will be publicly released soon for reference.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Reiterates Determination: Stabilize Rice Prices, Eliminate Labor Disputes. All Measures Will Absolutely Respect Public Opinion, Overcome All Difficulties, and Strive for the Welfare of Citizens.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu Guozhen hosted a luncheon yesterday at the New Life Club for the heads of various newspapers in this city. During the luncheon, Wu stated: "I have been appointed to Shanghai, and all municipal measures will be based on public opinion. However, the elected City Council has not yet been established. To understand the opinions of citizens, I hope that the press will reflect genuine public opinion. The media is the most adequate measure of all administrative measures of the municipal government. My actions are based on benefiting all citizens of the city, and I will not be deterred by any obstacles. To implement my ideas, I am willing to sacrifice my reputation and position." He then invited those present to express their opinions. Hu Pu'an, Cheng Cangbo, Wang Yunsheng, Pan Gongzhan, and others spoke successively, offering many suggestions on municipal matters. Wu expressed his acceptance of all points raised and explained two points: (1) Regarding the issue of sanitation worker strikes, it has now been completely resolved unconditionally. The city government has agreed to make reasonable adjustments to their future living conditions. The garbage that has not yet been cleared from the city due to long-term accumulation and insufficient transportation is currently being handled with the assistance of road repair vehicles borrowed from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. It is expected that it can be completely cleared within the next two days. (2) Regarding the new police measures, there are many rumors circulating. In fact, the police district system is the District System that has been implemented in England and the United States for a long time. After its implementation in the future, it should not lead to the various malpractices speculated by the outside world. In addition, Wu expressed his personal views, believing that the most important tasks at present are (1) suppressing prices, and to suppress prices, rice prices must first be suppressed. After days of running around and contacting people, the rice price issue has generally been stabilized and there should be no problems in the future. (2) The labor dispute issue. Currently, the wages in this city have already exceeded the US wage standards. For example, the pre-war production cost of cotton yarn was only 3 US cents, but now it has exceeded 45 US cents, while the current cost in the United States is only 16 US cents. I certainly do not want to lower wages, but wise workers should also know that if you want to eat chicken eggs, you cannot kill the hen first. If workers make unreasonable demands for higher wages again in the future, the production industry in Shanghai is likely to face a complete standstill in five or six months, which is what I am most worried about. Finally, Wu expressed his hope that receptions like today's could be held from time to time so that the opinions of citizens could be conveyed through the press, and the municipal government would have a basis to rely on.</p>
<p>Hu Pu'an: Stated that the biggest problems in Shanghai at present are food and housing. Constantly rising rice prices prevent people from living in peace, and rapid measures should be taken to suppress them. Those who originally lived in Shanghai do not feel difficulties in housing, but those who came to Shanghai from the rear after the victory find it difficult to find a house, which is a very serious problem. It is hoped that it can be resolved quickly.</p>
<p>Cheng Cangbo: Stated that the most urgent problem to be solved is the food problem. The measures taken by Mayor Wu to stabilize food prices after his arrival in office have been warmly supported by the citizens. However, the grain merchants who hoard and manipulate the market are still secretly active. It is hoped that the mayor will use resolute means to severely punish them to achieve the effect of "punishing one to warn a hundred." Secondly, health problems, traffic problems, and security problems should be closely monitored and efforts should be made to improve them. Regarding the security problem, most people only pay attention to preventing bandits and robberies, but they do not know that this is only "narrow security," and "broad security" should be given special attention. Since the victory, there have been many special classes who rely on their positions and power to engage in various illegal activities, bullying and extorting the people. This bad atmosphere must be completely eradicated. With Mayor Wu's position and prestige, it is believed that he will be able to overcome environmental obstacles and relieve the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>Wang Yunsheng: (1) Democratic politics originated in Greece. Greek democratic politics were actually city government politics, that is, the city government and the people were integrated. In the current era of democracy, all officials of the new people should help people live and solve various problems in life, and should no longer seek to manage the people. During the War of Resistance, the government used the four words "manage," "educate," "raise," and "protect" as the goals of local politics. This slogan should be revised now, because politics and education must be separated. The government has no right to educate the people, nor the power to raise the people. Protecting the people and enabling them to live and work in peace is the most important task. But to achieve the goal of enabling people to live and work in peace, we must eliminate the violent and appease the good. If a small number of violent elements cannot be removed, social order cannot be maintained, and good people cannot live and work in peace. Today, the government must show determination and courage to eliminate the violent and appease the good, and cannot continue to procrastinate. Take the labor disputes as an example. The recent labor disputes in Shanghai have changed from economic to political. There are many people who are secretly inciting and manipulating labor disputes. For example, the rickshaw pullers' strike was not unanimous, but some people deliberately punctured rickshaw tires to prevent the pullers from pulling their rickshaws. These troublemakers are not rickshaw pullers. They are actually sent by a certain party in northern Jiangsu. In addition to engaging in destructive work, they also use the banknotes squeezed in the "liberated areas" to buy goods and raise prices. I have seen slogans posted by striking workers in a certain industry saying, "It is better to starve to death than to break the law." May I ask: since someone publicly incites "breaking the law," and the government does not investigate and punish it severely, how can social order be maintained and how can people live in peace? I have always advocated "using severe penalties to govern troubled times." Only by eliminating the violent can we appease the good. Secondly, I strongly agree with Mr. Yunsheng's opinion that things that do not need to be done should not be done as much as possible. For all reform measures, the public opinion should be heeded before they are implemented.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Heist Takes Unexpected Turn: Chongqing Bank Allegedly Destroys Evidence by Altering Seized Ledgers. Manager Zhu Zhifei Unable to be Summoned for Questioning.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Yuancheng, the Ningbo native who is the main suspect in the Central Bank heist, is currently being pursued by the police. However, it has been found that Chen had pawned gold bars at the Chongqing Bank for 63 million yuan, stating that the term was ten days. However, he did not redeem them by the deadline, so the bank sold the gold bars. After the Huangpu Branch retrieved the original stolen goods, it sent personnel to the Shanghai branch of the Chongqing Bank to retrieve a ledger book for collateral loans for inspection. Who knew that Zhu Zhifei, the manager of the Chongqing Bank, would go to the Huangpu Branch with a friend at 9 pm the night before, requesting Zhou Guanghui, the section chief, to let him see the ledger. Yao Hongzhang, a patrol officer, gave him the ledger for inspection, but Zhu suddenly took the opportunity to alter seven entries in the ledger that recorded illegal loans using gold and other items, attempting to destroy evidence to avoid being penalized by the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Bank. His whereabouts are currently unknown. After the Huangpu Branch discovered Zhu's illegal behavior, it immediately issued a summons. The bank claimed that Zhu had left Shanghai, so Wu Zhigang, the assistant manager of the bank, turned himself in to explain. This unexpected problem in the major theft case is currently being investigated by the police.</p>
<h3>Minister Gu to Come to Shanghai Today to Address Labor Leaders Regarding Handling of Labor Disputes.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang came to Shanghai by night train from Beijing last night and is expected to arrive here at 6:50 this morning. Minister Gu's trip is to deal with the recent surge of labor disputes and the problem of unemployed workers in this city. In order to enable the responsible persons of various labor unions to lead their members to increase production efficiency and strengthen the national construction force, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has specially convened the standing directors or preparatory directors of various industrial unions at the Queen's Grand Theater on Tibet Road at 2:00 pm today to listen to the instructions of Minister Gu and Mayor Wu. Important instructions will be given on the responsibilities that workers should bear during the national construction period, the government's future policies on handling labor disputes, and the determination of wage standards.</p>
<h3>Cargo Ships Unable to Enter the Port, US Military Ships to be Moved to Qingdao.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that the US Navy authorities in this city are currently considering gradually moving a large number of US Navy ships stationed in this city to Qingdao to improve congestion in the port. Qingdao port is suitable for the development of naval operations, while the port of this city cannot accommodate large ships. Foreign shipping companies in this city believe that the congestion of ships in the port prevents foreign ships from berthing. For example, the American President Lines has as many as eight ships stranded outside the port waiting to berth. Therefore, the inflow of foreign goods is obstructed. In addition, US Navy ships occupy a large number of docks. Currently, from the 30th pier to the Bund, the cost of transporting goods in this section is US$3.5 per ton, and the cost of transporting goods in the section below the 30th pier is as high as US$5.25 per ton. Therefore, after the US Navy ships are moved, a large number of docks will be vacated for use, and the cost of transporting various goods can be expected to decrease.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese to be Repatriated to their Original Residences Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>At the invitation of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission specially sent Gan, the director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Management Office, to Shanghai to assist in sending overseas Chinese back to their places of residence. The UNRRA has allocated 15 ships for the repatriation of overseas Chinese. Hong Kong will be used as a concentration point for all overseas Chinese, and then they will be transported in batches from Hong Kong. Work can begin on June 20. Overseas Chinese who wish to return to their original places of residence need to bring their documents when registering. If the documents were lost during the war, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will investigate and confirm with the local consulate before registration can be done.</p>
<h3>Labor Disputes Surging</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The entire group of pig slaughtering workers at the No. 1 Slaughterhouse on Shajing Road in this city clashed with the employers the night before due to opposition to the employers' exploitation and breach of contract. Several employees were injured, causing a disturbance. Yesterday, employees posted slogans on the street to protest the employer's actions.</p>
<p>The employees of the World Book Company have been practicing slowdowns since yesterday because they have not been able to obtain the same treatment as the employees of the Zhonghua and other book companies.</p>
<p>The labor-management dispute in the Western clothing industry is being mediated by Mr. Zhu Xuefan. Negotiations continued yesterday, but no results were achieved, so the negotiations have stalled. The matter will be arbitrated by the Arbitration Committee.</p>
<p>The labor-management dispute in the silk industry has been ongoing for nearly three months. The labor union once went on strike, but after following advice, they resumed work and continued negotiations. It has now been resolved, and the mediation record was signed at the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The slowdown at Sheng Bingji Department Store has not yet been resolved and will be formally negotiated at the Bureau of Social Affairs this afternoon.</p>
<p>The matter of the hotel staff's request for increased benefits was resolved at noon yesterday. The minimum for Class A is 187,500 yuan, and the minimum for Class B is 127,500 yuan. Calculated according to the share-out system, if the room rate is 80%, it will be calculated at 80%, and so on.</p>
<p>The oil paint workers in the city demanded that their pay be increased from 6,000 yuan per day to 12,000 yuan, but no results were achieved, so they began a slowdown a few days ago. Yesterday, they also went to the Bureau of Social Affairs to petition for mediation.</p>
<p>The employees of the China Aviation Company's Huaji Airport requested adjustment of their benefits. After several negotiations, no results were achieved. The company side especially proposed temporarily borrowing 200,000 yuan per person, which would be discussed again after resuming work. The labor side believes that this method is far from the actual requirements, and has not accepted it, so there is still no hope of resuming work.</p>
<p>The employees of the dyeing and handkerchief industries went on strike to demand improved benefits from the employers. They once again appealed to the Bureau of Social Affairs for mediation at about 10 am yesterday. After negotiations between the two parties, the opinions differed only slightly. However, the employers' intention to prolong the labor dispute has caused deep dissatisfaction among the authorities.</p>

The date of Xuan's official takeover has been decided to be June 1st.</p>
<h3>This Month's Cost of Living Index Will Exceed Last Month's by a Significant Amount</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government compiles a cost of living index every month. Because the general salaried class believes that the commodity prices in this city in April were higher than in March, but the result was that at the end of last month, the Municipal Government announced that the commodity price index in April was lower than in March, employees were all suspicious. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the Municipal Government calculates the commodity price index, as usual, on the last Wednesday of each month before the end of the month as the deadline for calculation. It is heard that the reason why the commodity price index for last month was lower than in March was that the sharp rise in commodity prices occurred after the last Wednesday before the end of April, which was included in the calculation for this month. It is heard that this month's cost of living index is much higher than last month's.</p>

<h3>Trial of Wang Jingwei's Private Secretary: Did Tang Liangli Have a Soul? Who Could Believe It? Debate Concluded on Liu Ruxiang and Four Other Cases; Liu Xingchen's Case to Be Sentenced This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 10:00 AM yesterday, Judge Qiu of the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court initially questioned Tang Liangli, the private secretary of the traitor Wang Jingwei. The defendant was represented by lawyers Chen Tingrui and Xu Yin. Tang, a native of Yunxiao, Fujian, was 46 years old. He had a prominent Japanese-style mustache, wore tortoise-shell glasses, and was dressed in a gray suit with yellow leather shoes, appearing quite aged. Tang was born in Java, once held Dutch citizenship, and studied in England. He spoke fluent English but was not proficient in Chinese. Therefore, lawyer Chen Tingrui served as the interpreter during the interrogation. In April of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), Tang served as the Director of the International Propaganda Bureau of the Propaganda Department, authored pro-Japanese propaganda books, which Wang Jingwei titled "It is Natural for China and Japan to be Friends, Unnatural to be Enemies," and published by the China United Society. The content distorted Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, taking phrases out of context and doing his utmost to ingratiate himself with the enemy. In May of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), he concurrently served as the Vice Minister of the Puppet Foreign Ministry; in September of the same year, he concurrently served as the Vice Minister of the Puppet Propaganda Department; in September of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he was transferred to serve as the Director of the Puppet Institute of International Problems, until the victory of the war. He was arrested by the Military Intelligence Bureau and handed over to the High Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. According to Tang's statement, he had opposed imperialism since childhood. When he was in Java, he fled to England due to Dutch oppression. From the age of fifteen, he joined the Anti-Japanese Alliance, using writing as a weapon to resist Japanese imperialism. In 1930, he returned to China to engage in practical anti-Japanese propaganda work. Because he was unwilling to be protected by foreign consular jurisdiction, he returned his Dutch citizenship certificate and resumed his Chinese nationality. His anti-Japanese English books, such as "Manchukuo: Puppet State," "China's Reconstruction," "China's Railways," "China's Resistance to Japanese Aggression," "China's New Currency System," and the "People's Forum" he edited, were all popular among anti-Japanese patriots. In 1939, he was arrested by the Japanese. Although he was released soon after, his actions were monitored. Because of his writing skills and reputation, he was forced to take up puppet positions, but they were all nominal, and he did not do any actual work. He insisted, "Although my body was conquered by them, my heart and soul still belonged to the motherland." During his tenure as the Director of the Puppet Institute of International Problems, he was dismissed due to poor performance, which displeased the Japanese. He strongly stated that he had not engaged in any actions that were against his country or benefited the enemy. Judge Qiu stated that the case still required detailed investigation and adjourned the hearing. After the court session, the defendant met with his family to inquire about their well-being and was then taken back to prison.</p>

<h3>A Portion of U.S. Surplus Materials Arrives in Shanghai; Jiang Shaojin Goes to Nanjing to Request Instructions on Distribution Methods</h3>
<p>A portion of the U.S. military's Pacific surplus materials has already arrived in the city, and a large quantity of materials is on its way to China.

In addition, thousands of tons of military rations have also arrived and have begun to be transported to Nanjing for distribution to public servants and teachers. More than 10,000 prefabricated houses will also be transported to China to alleviate the severe housing shortage. Regarding these surplus materials, in addition to military supplies, all institutions, organizations, businesses, and civilians can apply to purchase them with cash. However, to prevent speculation and manipulation, a registration form for trade associations has been printed to verify the legitimacy of the applicant's purpose. Specific measures will be announced after Director Jiang returns to Shanghai in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Chinese and Western Drug Dealers in the City Ordered to Register and Obtain Licenses by Deadline</h3>
<p>There are no less than several thousand Chinese and Western drug dealers in the city, but only more than 500 have registered so far. Although the Health Bureau has repeatedly notified them separately to handle this by the deadline, the number of applicants is still very small. The health authorities believe that such delays are hindering the advancement of government orders. It has recently been heard that a uniform deadline has been set for the end of June to comply with the registration and licensing procedures; otherwise, they will be punished in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3>The Zhongguang Factory Housing Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Zhongguang Underwear Manufacturing Factory on Xizang Road rented a storefront from the Qichang Photo Studio on Nanjing Road in the 29th year of the Republic (1940) to set up a sales department. Before long, the second landlord, Sun Qichang, took it back for his own use. Zhongguang tried to make peace, but at that time the enemy and puppets were rampant. The house was suddenly leased by the Japanese company Tibbai 洋行. Tibbai 洋行 repeatedly forced Zhongguang to move out unsuccessfully. After the victory, Sun sued the court again on the 18th of this month, but the result was dismissed due to procedural defects.</p>

<h3>Incident Coincidence Causes Citizens to Suspect the Strange; Fire Broke Out Near the Snake Killed in Nanshi</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the open space between Ninghe Road and Wuyuan Street in Nanshi (the old Land Bureau, also known as Yes Garden), there were originally three giant trees, the middle one being the largest. There was a hole in the tree. At 3:30 PM yesterday, a golden yellow snake, about ten feet long, crawled out of the hole. Suddenly, the viewers gathered together and killed it. After a while, a fire suddenly broke out in the home of Xu Liu at 35 Gujia Lane nearby. The fire brigade rushed to the scene and put out the fire, burning only part of the kitchen. But strangely, thick smoke was also billowing and flames were shooting out of the tree hole where the giant snake had resided. Although firefighters rushed to water it, it had no effect. The men and women living nearby, believing in superstitions, burned incense and prayed. An enthusiast put the dead giant snake in a coffin. Later, the fire subsided slightly and was completely extinguished until 6:30 PM in the evening.</p>

<h3>British University Students Willing to Undergo Medical Experiments: Implementation to Begin in July This Year</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the British Information Service, London, 28th] The British Medical Research Council and the Ministry of Health are jointly planning to establish an influenza research institute. Influenza is a particularly complex disease, and it has not yet been possible to use animals for experimental research. However, when the institute begins its work in July, it will select students from British universities who volunteer to undergo experiments for ten to fourteen days. The students will be isolated from the outside world and from each other. The purpose of this work is to seek the nature of the source of influenza. If a conclusion can be reached within two years, it can be regarded as a significant achievement.</p>
<h3>30th Anniversary of the Death of Russian Microbiologist: Scientific Conference Held in Moscow</h3>

Attendees include representatives from scientific research institutions in Moscow and renowned scientists from cities across the country. The conference is dedicated to discussing the immunology that Ilya Metchnikoff devoted his life to studying.</p>
<h3>Initiator of Breaking Traditional Education: The Yucai School in Beibei; American "One Week" Magazine Publishes News in a Prominent Position</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the American News Service, San Francisco, May 27th] The American magazine "One Week" published on the 19th, in a prominent position, information about the "Yucai School" located fifty miles north of Chongqing in Beibei, which is specifically for gifted children. The founder of the school is Dr. Tao Xingzhi. Tao graduated from the University of Illinois in the United States and was a student of the famous educator John Dewey at Columbia University.</p>
<p>Motivation for Founding</p>
<p>According to the magazine, in 1938, Tao encountered a ragged child wandering on the streets of Hankou while he was instructing some young children squatting by the roadside to sing. Tao immediately took the child to a music teacher for training. Within three days, the child was able to write out the melody in musical notation after listening to songs he was unfamiliar with. This experience inspired Dr. Tao to establish a school. He gathered a small number of teachers who were willing to engage in this work, which was almost entirely of a voluntary nature. They visited and tested thousands of children in fifteen provinces of China, searching for children with particularly outstanding talents. These children are expected to become leaders in China's future art and academic circles. The Yucai School was established with a core of writers, artists, musicians, and scientists.</p>
<p>Source of Donations</p>
<p>Later, Tao requested assistance from the United States. All donations from Americans were turned over to the United China Relief Association in New York for transfer. It is said that the largest source of donations is from American school children. The school currently has 400 students, ranging in age from six to twenty. These children are selected from rural areas in war zones or from impoverished families. After testing, if they demonstrate special talents, they can receive training to become young artists, musicians, writers, scientists, and workers in society. However, their education does not stop there. Every student believes that it is their responsibility to pass on what they have learned to others.</p>
<p>Teaching Farmers and Workers</p>
<p>Therefore, these students must spend at least one hour each day teaching approximately two thousand farmers, miners, and their families to read and write, and imparting knowledge of hygiene, handicrafts, and democratic principles. Children attend classes for 36 to 40 hours per week. They also learn first aid, cooking, sewing, driving, and swimming. However, they seem most interested in music, drama, painting, dance, literature, natural sciences, and social sciences. To break with China's traditional concepts, all staff and students at the school personally engage in various manual tasks, in order to develop self-reliance. They even wash their own clothes, make their own utensils, and cultivate part of the school's farm.</p>
<h3>Respect Teachers Movement: Student Fundraising Concluded Successfully; Charity Sale of Calligraphy and Paintings to Be Raffled Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The student fundraising for the Respect Teachers Movement in this city was successfully concluded yesterday afternoon. The collected donations will be sent to the designated bank today. The bank receipt should be used to complete the process with the association. All used donation books, member badges, liaison badges, and remaining red and blue thank you stickers must be returned.</p>
<p>Student Fundraising Situation</p>
<p>The donation situation in various shops exceeded expectations. For example, Da Butong Shoe Store had more than sixty red and blue donation thank you stickers on its shop window. ABC Raincoat Factory had even more, with more than one hundred and ninety stickers. Hongxiang Fashion Company had all three shop windows covered, too many to count. Other examples include Hongbao Fresh Bridge Factory, which provided over a thousand dozen bottles of soda, sauce water, and fresh orange water in two days. Zhonghua Manufacturing Factory, Ai Ai Pharmacy, Wuzhou Pharmacy, Wanguo Pharmacy, Aimei Pharmacy, Zhongying Pharmacy, and Municipal North Middle School donated thousands of packages of various emergency medicines such as Rendan, Nidan, Bagua Dan, Shajiang Water, and Wan Jin. Yesterday's fundraising targets, in addition to businesses, also included factories and offices, with good results. It is reported that each group from Tongde Medical College raised over 300,000 yuan, with the highest group raising 490,000 yuan. The distribution of this donation will be decided jointly by school principals, representatives from industry and commerce, representatives from the association, and student representatives.

<p>Charity Sale of Calligraphy and Paintings Situation</p>
<p>[Another Report] The charity exhibition of calligraphy and paintings held at the French Elementary School on Huanlu Road has seen a continuous stream of visitors since its opening on the 25th. Most of the calligraphy and painting tickets, priced at 20,000 yuan each, have been sold. It is scheduled to hold a public lottery at the venue today and tomorrow (the 29th and 30th) to draw the numbers for claiming the items. To prevent overcrowding, the association has dispatched additional staff to the venue to assist. Those who hold calligraphy and painting tickets are requested to bring their tickets to the venue for the lottery on these two days, from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM each day. In addition, auctions of masterpieces have been held continuously in recent days. Enthusiastic individuals can go to bid, with the highest bidder winning. Mr. Xiao Guang of the association generously donated 100 mu of fertile land in Dinghai County, Pujiang, which is also being auctioned publicly at the venue, with a starting price of 40,000 yuan per mu. Those who wish to purchase can go to bid, fulfilling the meaning of respecting teachers while also obtaining good land, a win-win situation, an opportunity not to be missed. (Ren)</p>

<h3>Kunyu Expedition Basketball Team: Victorious in First Match Against Shantou Team; Chiang Wei-kuo Attends and Performs Tip-Off; Match Result 39 to 26</h3>
<p>The Kunyu Expedition Basketball Team's first match in Shanghai was against the Shantou Team at the Municipal Gymnasium last night at 7:45 PM. The audience who came for the reputation was no less than a thousand people. Major Chiang Wei-kuo and his wife arrived at the gymnasium at 7:30 PM and were accompanied into the venue by Lin Xucang, Chairman of the Basketball Committee. The audience responded with enthusiastic applause, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. As a result, the Kunyu team won its first match, 39 to 26. The score at halftime was 20 to 15.</p>
<p>After the photography session, Mr. Chiang Wei-kuo performed the tip-off ceremony, and both sides began to engage. Kunyu fielded Shi Kun, Da Yun, Yunming, Yanxiong, and Xiangcheng. Cai Yanxiong first broke the blue circle, and Lin Weicong immediately returned the color. Liang Yunming broke in and scored, and Tang Kun's long-range shot was successful. The Shantou team took the opportunity to attack, and He Lide and Zhen Qingjiang repeatedly gained points. Kunyu then recalled Yanxiong and replaced Yunming. When He Lide scored a bullseye, the first half ended with 20 to 15, with the visiting team taking the lead.</p>
<p>After the break, the two sides returned to the field. Liang Yunming scored, and the Shantou team's Zhen Qingjiang returned the favor. The Shantou team called a timeout, and Yunming scored again. Chen Qingjiang and He Lide's close-range and long-range shots were all successful, chasing closely for a while. The score difference between the guest and host teams was only two points, and the situation was tense. Kunyu was unwilling to show weakness. Da Yun held up a person under the basket, and Shi Kun was awarded a free throw. The visitor's momentum was revived. Eight minutes before the end of the game, Ma was injured and Zhou Bin replaced him. The Shantou team lost its main player, and Kunyu took the opportunity to attack fiercely. Shi Kun scored four points in a row, and Da Yun also added to the score, making it 37 to 24. Before long, Da Yun and Yanxiong were both disqualified for five fouls, and Pan Guobao and Liang Yunming were added to the team. Time was running out, but the overall situation was not affected. The silver whistle sounded, 39 to 26, and the Kunyu Expeditionary Force won its first match.</p>

<h3>An Ideal Elementary School Curriculum Should Focus on Activities in Four Areas: Intellectual, Moral, Physical, and Aesthetic</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>The revision meeting for the elementary school curriculum standards has officially begun, and we who serve in the field of elementary school education feel very excited! Especially today after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, this education meeting, which is related to our country's basic construction, makes us have very deep and warm expectations. However, the facts tell us that the convening of the meeting was not as grand as we imagined. The so-called "experts" who participated in the revision were not selected based on the principle of universal recruitment from across the country, nor were they based on the conditions of recruiting super-talented people. They casually invited a few nearby people and hurriedly started the meeting. How can there be any results from such perfunctory actions?</p>
<p>Originally, the Ministry of Education had six principles for this curriculum revision: (1) The courses of each subject are too complex and should be simplified, concise, and interesting. (2) The scope of teaching materials should be adapted to the physical and mental development of children, making it easy for children to understand. (3) The content of teaching materials should be universal, considering both urban and rural areas, and paying attention to timeliness and flexibility. (4) Compulsory education should take six years as the highest standard, and the curriculum must pay attention to the principle of continuity for six years, but can be divided into sections of four years. (5) In terms of training, emphasis should be placed on personal moral cultivation, legal concepts, democratic spirit, and the implementation of civil rights. (6) The curriculum standard is holistic, with equal emphasis on intellectual, moral, and physical education, and should not only focus on knowledge subjects. These six principles are quite concise and clear, but after the "experts" discussed them, they added the following two principles: "(1) The elementary school curriculum should focus on activities in five areas: civics, recreation, science, society, and language. (2) The elementary school curriculum is the minimum change in personality and behavior that is hoped to be achieved within the elementary school stage." The first additional principle divides civics, recreation, science, society, and language into five areas of activity. In principle, it seems a bit redundant and somewhat flawed. The most incomprehensible thing is to divide "science" and "society" into two separate areas. In fact, society is part of science. "Society" and "nature" in the elementary school curriculum are both "science." Now that "society" and "science" are independent, I don't know how to start when actually compiling the curriculum in the future?</p>
<p>As for the second added principle, it seems to focus solely on moral education. Is the elementary school curriculum just about hoping for the minimum change in personality and behavior within the elementary school stage? This is clearly illogical.</p>
<p>An ideal elementary school curriculum should focus on activities in four areas: intellectual, moral, physical, and aesthetic. Even if we lower our standards, we should follow the sixth principle originally set by the Ministry of Education, and only seek "equal emphasis on intellectual, moral, and physical education," which would still feel justifiable. These are my personal views, and I don't know if they are appropriate. I respectfully ask your newspaper to publish them, and I hope that the "experts" will provide more guidance. I would be very grateful!</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Weaken; US Dollar Still Exceptionally Popular</h3>
<p>Spot gold, though initially stable in early morning trading yesterday, gradually declined from 1.8 million [currency unit] and beyond. Overnight fears caused a drop to below 1.76 million. Afterwards, it stabilized slightly. The US dollar was popular, with strong demand for arbitrage. It briefly rose to around 1.78 million after struggling for a long time. The Central Bank of China allocated 132 bars [of gold], slightly lowering the price to 1.775 million. The price remained hovering around this level for ten days. The US dollar side continued to arbitrage, and by noon, it rebounded to above 1.79 million. At noon, it hovered around 1.79 million, and the afternoon started stably. It finally closed around 1.78 million, a slight decrease of 5,000 [currency unit] compared to the previous close. Ornamental gold remained at 190,000 [currency unit]. Silver was stable. The buying and selling of silver dollars was prohibited. Although quoted prices were similar to the previous day, purchasing was difficult. The discount rate remained around 1.3%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency, particularly US dollars, was in high demand for foreign firms' settlement of accounts, leading to exceptional tightness. Opening at 2300 [currency unit] in the morning, demand exceeded supply, causing a gradual rise. The gold market was sluggish, with multiple fluctuations mid-session. However, as demand remained strong, a decline was difficult. It rose to 2360 [currency unit] before noon, then retreated slightly. In the afternoon, it followed the gold price's movements, starting stable and then flat. The final result was a slight increase of ten [currency unit] compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes started flat and then stabilized, also gaining five [currency unit]. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were 410-420 [currency unit], Robbie was 520 [currency unit], with some trading. US exchange rates were reported flat.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds: Bulls and Bears Battle, Leading to Initial Weakness Followed by Strength</h3>
<p>In the public bond market, both bulls and bears displayed their skills, leading to rapid fluctuations. Series C bonds saw selling pressure from Northern traders. After a morning opening, prices weakened from 7450 [currency unit]. Bears took advantage of the situation, pushing the price below the 7,000 [currency unit] mark, reaching a low of 6,900 [currency unit]. Shanghai traders maintained support at lower levels, allowing the price to stabilize. A certain bank used small amounts of capital to absorb bonds at low prices. Encouraged by this, retail investors became active, pushing the price up to 7300 [currency unit] at noon, ending the day similar to the previous close. Series A, B, and E bonds were very active, while Series D bonds were extremely unpopular. Consequently, Series A and B bonds were only 100 [currency unit] lower, Series E bonds were 50 [currency unit] lower, while Series D bonds alone fell by 400 [currency unit].</p>
<h3>Yarn Market: Weak Sales; Reduced Cotton Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market experienced mixed fortunes. 20-count yarn was extremely average, fluctuating around 5,000 [currency unit]. 16-count yarn, which had been dormant for a long time, suddenly shone, soaring by 40,000-50,000 [currency unit]. 42-count double-strand thread, due to textile mills only selling to appointed merchants, and large quantities not being allocated, led to hoarding by fellow traders. Blue Wind's price rose to 2,530,000-2,540,000 [currency unit], an increase of 50,000-60,000 [currency unit] compared to the previous day. Despite weak sales, sentiment remained relatively stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday's New York American cotton telegram reported a drop of 15 to 18 points. The near-term price was US$27.73, the long-term price was US$28.33, and the spot price for middling cotton was US$28.35. Local spot cotton trading was reduced. Due to the frequent weakening of silk and gold prices and the drop in American cotton prices, factories were mainly in a wait-and-see mode, with only some speculative activity by traders. Market prices were generally similar.</p>
<h3>Textile Mill Supply Insufficient; Cloth Market Initially Weak, Then Rises</h3>
<p>The market was initially weak but then rose yesterday. In the morning, due to the period for opening sales of cloth from the Central Textile Mill, many traders sold to cash in their funds, in order to make further purchases from the Central Textile Mill. At the same time, buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, causing market weakness. The market price fell by 1,000 [currency unit]. At noon, the Central Textile Mill announced that 12-pound fine cloth was scarce and could not be supplied. Only 12-pound unbranded colored balls cloth, and An An blue cloth from number 775 to the last number, and from number 1 to 129, were allocated. All other numbers were completely unallocated. The allocation of Guanyin bleached cloth was also insufficient. As a result, the market rallied in the afternoon, rising by 1,000-2,000 [currency unit].</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Corporation: Second Sale of Medium Sugar</h3>
<p>The Taiwan Sugar Corporation will hold its second sale of medium granulated sugar today. The content of each bag, the qualifications for merchant applications, and the payment methods are the same as before. However, in order to stabilize prices, expand sales to actual users, and prevent hoarding, the company has improved the customer application process. The price of the sugar will not be announced in advance. Merchants can submit purchase requests to the company. These requests should be submitted to the company's business office between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM, and the approved quantity can be collected between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM.

<h3>Another 111 Institutions Approved to Operate Foreign Currency Exchange</h3>
<p>Various financial institutions in the city, in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Foreign Exchange," applied to the Central Bank for Type A operating licenses. On May 1st, the Bank announced the approval of 139 institutions and issued licenses, allowing them to engage in the business of buying and selling foreign currency banknotes. Subsequently, the Shanghai Money Exchange Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance and the Bank, stating that many members had misunderstood the regulations and failed to register in time, requesting a supplementary application process. The Bank authorities, in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, granted a grace period for processing. Another 111 institutions have now been approved, with money exchange shops accounting for the vast majority. The list is as follows: Dali, Dakang, Datong H记, Dakang Xinji, Dafayongji, Dakang Changji, Santai, Yuanyi, Yuanlong Heji, Yuanda, Yuansheng, Yuanshun, Gonghe, Tiantai, Zhenghua, Bingji, Zhengtai, Zhengfeng, Hengxiangji, Licheng, Yongfa, Yongda Xiangji, Tongchang, Tongsheng, Tongli Yongji, Hongyuan Xinji, Lishen, Hexing, Asia, XieKang, Shengchang, Mao Tai Changji, Xinyu Heji, Xincheng Chang, Mao Kang, Hengtai, Hengtai Xinji, Hengtai, Yulong, Xiangmao, Xiangyuan, Tongyi, Houchang, Houji, Tailai, Shenchang, Yifeng, Jin Tai Xieji, Jingcheng, Qiankang, Huashi, Shunli, Shunda, Fuxing 记, Fuyuan, Fuda, Wei Yuan, Zhongfu, Fukang, Wanli, Yongji, Huikang, Yuanchang Xinji, Yuantaihe, Yuanfeng, Xinfeng, Fuhe, Fucheng, Fukang Qingji, Fussen Songji, Fudashi Ji, Dingda, Huitong, Dexiang, Detai, Dechang, Guangli, Guangyu, Runde, Run Tai Yuanji, Xinghe Ruiji, Xinghua, 章记, Hongda Xinji, Hongyu Zhenji, Hongyu, Hongchang Yunji, 泰, Lianfeng, Baohua, Baoyuan Chang Bingji, Baoshen Fuji, Baoxiang Ningji, Baokang Zhiji, Shilong, Baochang, Yongtai, Taixing, Wanchang, Tongfeng, Heng Xieji, Fuda Zengji, Youli, Han Yong, Chengda, Wanxiang, Senyuan, Dahua, Tongtai Renji, Yixing Xingji, Yifeng, Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, Yongcheng Bank, Qiantai Commercial Bank, Zhongyi Trust Company. Each company has received a license from the bank. From today onwards, they will operate the business of buying and selling foreign currency banknotes in accordance with the provisions of the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Foreign Exchange." All banks and shops that have not obtained a license will not be allowed to apply again in the future and should automatically cease operating the business of buying and selling foreign currency banknotes from today onwards. The bank authorities also stated that the number of money exchange shops in the city is already large, and new establishments will not be allowed to operate the business of buying and selling foreign currency banknotes in the future.</p>
<h3>White Coal Declines Again; Coal Briquette Sales are Sluggish</h3>
<p>The coal market is quiet. Sales of white coal chunks are sluggish and continue to decline slightly. Sales of white coal dust are also very weak due to the sluggish sales of coal briquettes in various stores. The main reason for the sluggish sales of coal briquettes is the abundance of liquid fuels on the market, with many small household users switching to kerosene. It is reported that coal briquette manufacturers will soon submit a request to the Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting a reduction in the allocation price of Hongji coal dust, the raw material for making briquettes, in order to compete.</p>
<h3>Current Cocoon Price Problem: Increased Costs Lead to Losses for Silk Farmers; Wuxi County Still Needs to Levy a Special Tax</h3>
<p>(Wuxi News) The silk cocoon harvest in the Wuxi area, the center of Jiangnan silk production, was quite poor this spring. At the beginning of the silkworm rearing season this spring, there was a shortage of silkworm eggs, leading to a rise in egg prices. Mulberry leaf prices also jumped, directly increasing the cost of silkworm rearing and indirectly affecting the health of the silkworms. Because silk farmers believed that mulberry prices were too high, they did not distinguish between good and bad leaves and used them all to feed the silkworms. As the fresh cocoons came on the market, the cocoon prices did not cover the costs. It is estimated that each load of fresh cocoons sold results in a loss of over 50,000 [currency unit].</p>
<p>The Wuxi County Government, due to its huge expenditures and insufficient income, decided to levy a special tax on fresh cocoons. It is learned that the Wuxi silk cocoon industry, seeing no profit, cannot bear the additional tax. They jointly submitted a request to the County Government and the Provincial Government for an exemption. The reasons given by the silk cocoon industry are as follows: (1) Silk is one of China's main export products, and the government has already exempted export taxes. (2) The silk cocoon industry is currently experiencing significant losses and is adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Adding to the burden will make the future of the silk industry even more uncertain. (3) This special tax will directly affect planting grounds, silkworm farmers, cocoon merchants, and silk factories. If it is not exempted, it will lead to complete ruin.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Authorities Advise Increasing Cocoon Prices to 150,000 [Currency Unit] Per Load</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, this city) The price of fresh cocoons this year, based on the silk price, is 100,000 [currency unit] per market load, assuming 400 catties of silk, which silk merchants cannot bear. After the announcement by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, silkworm farmers complained that leaf prices were too high and did not cover costs. They repeatedly requested an increase. Subsequently, Zhejiang Governor Shen invited Party Committee Director Luo, Silk Association Chairman Chen, and General Manager Ge of the China Silk Company to discuss the matter. They all agreed to advise the silk factories to increase the purchase price in order to barely maintain the costs for silkworm farmers. Fortunately, the factories were able to heed the advice of the provincial Party and government authorities and increase the price of high-quality fresh cocoons to 150,000 [currency unit] per market load, depending on the quality. It is believed that the cocoons grown from the silkworm eggs purchased from Japan by the China Silk Company this year are of extremely high quality, much higher than the local varieties. After the cocoon price increase, although factories have 　　, the higher cost is not significant compared to the lower quality cocoons. As for increasing the overall purchase price by factories and raising costs, it is hoped that the government will take measures to provide subsidies.</p>
<h3>Weather Turns Hot, Holders Seek to Sell; Rice Prices See a Small Rebound Yesterday; Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Also Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather suddenly turned hot, and the rice market became an image of supply exceeding demand as holders sought to sell. Medium and lower grades of japonica and indica rice fell by nearly 1,000 [currency unit]. White Yuan rice also showed signs of softening. Flat-price flour has begun to be sold, and shop sales are bound to decrease, with reduced consumption. Market prices fell by 200-300 [currency unit], with few transactions. Soybeans also fell by 1,000 [currency unit], with minimal trading. Bran demand was weak, and prices fell by 100 [currency unit]. Oil cakes also declined along with other items, rebounding by 200-300 [currency unit]. Wheat was weak and lacked trading, with no buyers. The new wheat harvest is approaching. Red sorghum had few buyers, sesame was stagnant, and raw peanuts also became sluggish, falling by 1,000-2,000 [currency unit]. Corn had few customers and fell sharply by 2,000-3,000 [currency unit]. The oil market declined steadily due to the continuous arrival of goods from various routes. Raw oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, and clear oil all fell by around 2,000 [currency unit]. Yesterday, the amount of rice arriving in the city was approximately 7,000 shi, according to rice market information.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union to Cultivate Rice in the Far East</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] According to news from Vladivostok, the Soviet Union will cultivate the most important rice-producing farm in the Soviet Union in its Far East coastal region. The soil here is fertile and the climate is suitable for farming.</p>
<h3>Tea Market: Uneven Strength</h3>
<p>Recently, although the demand for Chinese tea in the foreign tea market, such as South America, is strong, the prices offered are extremely tight. Due to cost considerations, tea merchants in the city find it difficult to sell at low prices, resulting in sluggish exports. Recently, Jardine Matheson only loaded about 200 boxes of Haikou black tea, with prices at 40,000 [currency unit] per load. As for Tregon silk tea, which is exclusively sold to Mumbai, India, White-headed traders like Ruichang and 拈孖治 and other foreign firms continued to show interest, but holders are unwilling to sell without getting a good price, so transactions are difficult to finalize. However, the trend remains positive. Domestic sales of tea have both imports and exports, and the situation is not quiet, but market prices are uneven. Qimen tea has less demand than supply, and prices have fallen. New Longjing tea has many sources from various production areas, but the quality is poor, so prices continue to be lower. Other varieties remain stable.</p>
<h3>Egg Industry to Hold Market Discussions Twice Weekly</h3>
<p>Egg industry companies and shops in the city are holding discussions because the prices of miscellaneous grains have soared recently, and the cost of chicken and duck eggs in the producing areas is very high. In addition, water transport costs are enormous. It is impossible to maintain business without a unified adjustment of market prices. A meeting was held at the association on Sunday afternoon at 3:00 PM. More than 30 companies attended. It was resolved that chicken and duck egg market prices will be determined by the association at meetings held every Wednesday and Saturday. The prices decided at this meeting are as follows: large colored eggs 1,800,000 [currency unit] per thousand, medium 1,600,000 [currency unit], large 　 eggs 1,700,000 [currency unit] per thousand, medium 1,500,000 [currency unit], small 1,400,000 [currency unit], salted eggs 1,600,000 [currency unit], large fresh chicken eggs 1,350,000 [currency unit] per thousand, medium 1,150,000 [currency unit], small 1,000,000 [currency unit], chicken eggs 85,000 [currency unit] per 100 catties for large red shells, and 80,000 [currency unit] for white shells.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Slightly Decrease</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly soft. The association marked the price of medium granulated sugar for dock delivery at 73,500 [currency unit], later at 73,000 to 72,500 [currency unit]. New Company warehouse receipts were 70,000 [currency unit], spot goods were 74,000 [currency unit], later 73,000 to 72,000 [currency unit], and finally 72,500 [currency unit], a decrease of over 1,000 [currency unit]. Raw sugar was 61,000 [currency unit], and three-and-a-half white sugar was 78,000 to 80,000 [currency unit]. Some shipments of miscellaneous road green goods opened at 41,000 [currency unit].</p>
<h3>Jinshan Branches See New High Prices</h3>
<p>Jinshan branches are nearly　　due to a lack of arrivals and inventory. Recently, dozens of pieces of Jinshan flat branches arrived. Yesterday, they opened at 335,000 [currency unit], a new high price since the victory.</p>
<h3>Chile's Rice Production This Year is Particularly Abundant, Eight Times More Than Pre-War Production</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Santiago, 28th] Chile's 1945-46 rice harvest totaled 8,252,000 bushels (240 million pounds after milling), about 1 million bushels more than the last estimated figure of 7,286,000 bushels a year earlier. It is eight times more than pre-war production. This year's harvest is the fifth year of exceptionally high production. According to recent estimates, the rice-producing area in 1945-46 totaled 118,000 acres. The average yield this season is 70 bushels per acre. Rice exports in 1944-45 totaled about 100 million pounds.</p>
<h3>More American and Indian Cotton Arrive</h3>
<p>(This newspaper's report) The Qiangna Naiweige Tuoer (transliteration) ship, acting as agent for Shilong Foreign Company, arrived in Shanghai from Seattle, carrying 4,170 bales of cotton. It arrived yesterday afternoon and berthed at the Yitaixing Wharf in Pudong to unload.

<h3>Yongsha's One-for-Nine Stock Split Decided; Popular Stocks Become More Vigorous; Small and Medium-Sized Stocks Decline More Than Rise</h3>
<p>Although retail investors in Chinese stocks were excited, they were no match for large investors selling at high prices, repeating the old pattern of the previous day, with initial strength followed by weakness. At the peak, Yongsha reached a new high of around 6,450 [currency unit], and Meiya reached 5,900 [currency unit]. Small stocks were extremely inferior and failed to surpass the high prices of the previous day. Apart from Xinguang, which attracted attention, and following Jingfu, saw a squeeze. The result was that most stocks saw lower prices near noon. Prices rose slightly after the noon close. Jingfu and Qinxing fell slightly. Among the less popular small and medium-sized stocks, declines outnumbered gains. Yongsha's capital adjustment decided on a one-for-nine stock split. After a dividend of three [currency unit], the psychological effect on speculative funds made them more excited about popular stocks. Without significant selling pressure, the trend is likely to rise rather than fall. The veteran stocks have a slightly more stable foothold, with buyers at low levels, and trading has increased slightly. Foreign stock trading was sluggish, with demand mostly scattered. There was still selling of large inventories. Yisha retreated from an opening of 12,700 [currency unit] to 11,700 [currency unit]. Industry players took advantage of the low price to absorb, providing support. After the weakness, it stabilized slightly. The final result compared to the previous close, apart from steel, which rose slightly, and industry advertisements, which were flat, the rest continued to decline slightly.</p>
<h3>American Soybeans: 7,000 Tons Imported Yesterday</h3>

The Qiaosidiningmansike,經理 by Rong 　 Company, transported 3,000 tons of Indian cotton from Mumbai to Shanghai. It was expected to enter port at 8:00 PM yesterday and berth at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong to unload.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Imports of American caustic soda are scarce, and the actual sales of factories in the city are increasing daily. Local inventory is gradually thinning. Yesterday, it was reported by industry insiders that a certain foreign firm has not shipped goods for a long time, and the allocation price for subsequent batches will continue to rise. Vaseline, bleaching powder, and sulfuric acid have continued to arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>In the past one or two months, ordinary citizens have switched to burning kerosene, and the sales of firewood and charcoal have sharply declined. It is reported that in the past week, the amount of firewood and charcoal transported to Shanghai from the Jinshan area has been considerable, and inventory is increasing daily.</p>
<p>The American-owned Shanghai Power Company resumed operations after the victory. Initially, due to high expenses, it suffered huge losses every month. Since this month, business has greatly improved. It is expected that there will be no losses at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The current Economic Affairs Ministry's special commissioner for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, Zhang Zi　, had submitted his resignation, but Minister Wang in Shanghai has persuaded him to stay. The special commissioner's office has not yet completed its takeover tasks and needs to continue, and will not be abolished in the short term.</p>

<h3>29 Days in Changchun (11)</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>During our detention, the Communist Party's propaganda efforts unfolded. The Northeast Daily, the official newspaper of the CCP Northeast Bureau, moved from Jilin. The Changchun Daily was re-established. Even the Japanese newspaper, Democratic Daily (published by the Democratic Japan Society), was launched, with the headline article titled "Sino-Japanese Cooperation, Realizing Northeast Construction Through Democratic Struggle, Intending to　　". We also saw a mimeographed Japanese newspaper, claiming that an American journalist's small　plane had been stolen. This was a fabrication; we dare not say other news.</p>
<p>We could only conduct interviews inside the house, but we were tired of looking at all the sofas and chairs in the house. Everyone's faces were　hot. Li Lippman therefore suggested to 　　to borrow some machine guns from the Eighth Route Army for us to play with, to let us open fire and fight each other until we all fell to the ground, which could also save trouble in the future.</p>
<h3>Activities of the Japanese Communist Party</h3>
<p>On the 24th, Zhou Baozhong dispatched guards to escort us out, which was the second "freedom" mentioned in the previous text. As we walked down the street, we saw hundreds, even thousands, of Japanese people leisurely strolling, seemingly more free than we were. At that time, we felt very uncomfortable, always sensing that in Changchun, there was another kind of people and another kind of power at work. This other kind of people and power, we can specifically report, is the Japanese Communist Party.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 25th, when Zhou Baozhong came to our reporters' residence for dinner, Shen Zhi was the first to ask him, "The Japanese Communist Party in Changchun is very active right now. We even saw leaflets they distributed to Japanese residents of Changchun on the 20th. I wonder what your opinion is on this matter?" Zhou immediately replied, "In our eyes, regardless of whether the Japanese are revolutionary or not, they are all the same. They are, after all, Japanese." He then asked, "What is the relationship between Gangye Susumu, the leader of the Japanese Communist Party in Yan'an, and the Northeast?" Zhou replied, "There is no relationship at all." It was indeed a fact that Gangye Susumu's leaflets to the Japanese residents in Changchun existed. Shi Xun asked him, "Then what is your view on the government's current work of repatriating Japanese residents?" Zhou replied, "As we see it, if they like to stay here, that's fine. Conversely, if they want to go back, we naturally don't object."</p>
<p>We did not personally witness Japanese people fighting in the Communist army, because we were confined to our rooms. Therefore, we cannot make reckless statements about the truth or falsehood of the facts to our readers. However, it is true that we personally saw Japanese people working together before driving vehicles and painting large slogans on walls. Shi Xun once asked Lü Zhengcao whether there were still Japanese people in the factory. Lü Zhengcao did not answer directly, but he said, "These are all members." He told us that there were still Japanese employees in the water and electricity plant and the tram company.</p>
<p>After the Communist army occupied Changchun, in the beginning, when everything was not yet in order, the Japanese Communist Party was not very active. Only Gangye Susumu's "Leaflet to the Japanese Residents" could be seen on the streets, pasted on walls or scattered on the ground. This leaflet was brought to us by our chief steward on the morning of the 24th, snatched from the street on his way back from buying groceries.</p>
<p>On the 26th, the activities of the Japanese Communist Party became more concrete. The so-called Preparatory Committee of the Japanese People's Democratic League in Changchun was established. On the 27th, a lengthy declaration was issued, along with a concrete program and regulations for current work facilities.</p>
<p>Regarding the program, the translation is as follows: (1) Unite the Japanese residents in the Northeast, assist in the construction of the Northeast, strive for peace in the Northeast, develop true democracy, and promote the construction of the motherland as soon as possible through the progressive democratic front of Japan. (2) This league will consult with the Democratic Autonomous Government of China to determine the stable life and social and political status of our Japanese compatriots in the Northeast. (3) Eliminate militarism in the country, eliminate reactionary elements in the country, and liquidate the selfish concept of imperialism. And thoroughly strengthen democratic activities.</p>
<p>Regarding the regulations for work facilities, there are three: (1) Build a peaceful and unified new Northeast. (2) Eliminate militarism and reactionary elements, and liquidate militarism. (3) Participate in technical cooperation in the construction of the new Northeast. (4) Establish the rights of Japanese residents to reside, movable property rights, business rights, and cultivation rights on the land of the new Northeast. (5) Establish universal democratic education. (6) Thoroughly provide relief to refugees. (7) Expedite the resolution of repatriation issues. (8) Strengthen the friendship between the Chinese people. (9) Promote democratic construction and a broad democratic front in Japan.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the 27th, the Preparatory Committee of the Japanese People's Democratic League in Changchun negotiated with the Changchun Municipal Government supported by the Chinese Communist Party and decided to shut down several Japanese newspapers that had been anti-democratic in Changchun. As far as we know, the newspapers that were shut down include the Changchun Japanese News, the Northeast Japan News, and the Japanese Residents Changchun News.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Democratic Japan Daily News, a half-sized newspaper supported and published by the Democratic Japan Society, emerged. Each copy costs two yuan, and the monthly subscription is forty-five yuan. This is currently the only Japanese newspaper in Changchun, so its circulation is quite wide.</p>
<p>The newspaper was launched on the 29th. The inaugural editorial was an article titled "Promoting China-Japan Cooperation and Realizing the Desire to Build the Northeast through Democratic Struggle." This article was mentioned in the previous section, and a brief translation of its main points is as follows:</p>
<p>"Today, the Northeast People's Autonomous Army has entered Changchun, and therefore the democratic activities of us Japanese people can also be fully free. We will cooperate with the most progressive leaders in China, and the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Japanese People's Democratic League in Changchun is also for this purpose."</p>
<p>"These most progressive leaders in China have given us broad freedom in the democratic struggle. Therefore, we will reject the imperialist leaders of the past and decide to establish a true friendship between the two nations of China and Japan."</p>
<p>"The Democratic Japan Daily News is determined to protect the interests of the Japanese residents in the Northeast, to establish protection for residence, property, business, and cultivation. We sincerely hope that readers will cherish this good companion on the democratic front and support it as one."</p>
<p>The Changchun Municipal Government, under the support of the Chinese Communist Party (the original City Hall near Datong Square was razed to the ground by the Communist army's bombs during this war, and the current Communist Party's municipal government has moved to the old Da Hing office near the railway station), has stipulated the organization of Japanese cultural and social groups. At the same time, upon the request of the Japanese People's Democratic League, the Communist Changchun Municipal Government has provided a large amount of miscellaneous grains and fuel for the use of Japanese people. In addition, so-called foreign affairs bureaus, overseas Chinese affairs sections, and ethnic affairs sections have been established.</p>
<p>Because we spent more days indoors and fewer days outdoors, and even when we could go out, it was only for a short time and under "protection," we really knew too little. We dare not say that Gangye Susumu is in Changchun; we certainly have not seen him. According to what we have learned in Changchun, the most active member of the Japanese Communist Party in Changchun is Nishio Saburo. He once wrote a lengthy and earnest letter to Japanese youth, titled "An Announcement for Young Compatriots to Shift Upward." It also occupied a prominent position in the inaugural issue of the Democratic Japan Daily News on the 29th. Its content is largely similar to the declaration of the Preparatory Committee of the Japanese People's Democratic League, but the article also reviews the Meiji Restoration and makes a general historical pilgrimage, and speaks of the true meaning of democratic autonomy.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Japanese Communist Party is free and active in Changchun. But how many Communist Party members they have and how large their circle of activity is are things that we cannot know.</p>
<h3>Spring Comes Slowly</h3>
<p>During our detention, it was only on the 25th that we discovered that willow branches were budding. On May 1st, we two, accompanied by Baker's secretary Liu Ke, went through Datong Square to the railway station and then to several shopping malls to take a look. This was our first attempt to go out.</p>
<p>The next day, Liu Juying invited us to dinner. Zhou Baozhong announced at the table, "From today onwards, everyone is free to go out for interviews, to go wherever you want, and to talk to anyone you want."</p>
<p>The war had been over for half a month, and this war story is being written more than half a month later. What the scene after the war is like is a mystery, and how to write it? Everything has cooled down. The news value has been lost.</p>
<p>This is a difficult problem. We have no choice but to stroll around the market and sit in Japanese-run coffee shops to avoid continuing to be bored.</p>
<p>However, each of us cannot help but praise Changchun. Changchun is beautiful, with clean and wide asphalt roads. Even the stone roads are as smooth as a whetstone, paved into patterns that bring pleasure. Weeping willows and French plane trees are planted everywhere along the roads, and at this time, they are just starting to show their tender green, and we see only a faint green mist permeating the sky above the roads and the surroundings of the buildings. Although Changchun is full of collapsed buildings and broken walls, we still praise it, giving it a fair evaluation, saying that its beauty is no less than Washington, or that it can be called a small Washington, and we forget the pain of war.</p>
<p>The urban area of Changchun is 16,000 meters from north to south and 12,000 meters from east to west, with five parks and more than ten squares. The botanical and zoological garden is 1,200 mu in size. Looking at the urban area map (during the war, we used this map to identify the location of gunfire and all situations), although the city was not completed according to the design, we immediately recognized that this city is the best in China, and no other city can compare.</p>
<p>We ride in a car in the fierce spring wind, and we still have to wear leather clothes. The car stopped at the railway station. Although the trains run to the north and south, the station is silent, and we found no more than ten people waiting for the train. They look confused, only hoping that a train will come and they can take it to the place they want to go. They cannot help but feel nostalgic for the place where Beckett used to buy vodka, but when they went in to take a look, there was nothing there, not even a broken glass bottle. There was only dust everywhere.</p>
<p>In the center of the square in front of the station, there are four mounds of earth, probably burying four corpses, with Russian names written on them, perhaps victims of this war. But there is no place to see the Chinese people who sacrificed.</p>
<p>The station square is also extremely deserted, with a dozen or so Communist soldiers practicing with hand grenades.</p>
<p>So the car immediately returned to Datong Square, and we went to visit the Central Bank. Seventeen days ago, war was raging here, but now it is silent. Our car circled around the bank. The building is intact, but there are many bomb craters on the roof, but none of them pierced the walls, and not a single pane of the glass windows is unbroken. In the parts that were burned, the flames once came out of the window holes, licking the outside of the window holes black. A national flag, soaked with gunpowder smoke, still hangs on it, hanging for 24 hours a day, torn by the wind, suffering all kinds of torture, with no one to take care of it.</p>
<p>The door of the Central Bank is open, and there are no guards. We heard Liu Ke ask why. The answer was that they were afraid that there were still bombs and landmines inside. We did not go in. But we saw that countless boxes and materials originally piled up behind the back door were completely gone. A gust of wind blew, and we could only hear the broken glass still falling continuously, clanging everywhere. It was extremely desolate. Seeing this situation, we could not help but feel sad. How much blood has been shed here that has caused pain to the Chinese people and has caused the world to sigh!</p>
<p>It was three o'clock in the afternoon when we went to the market. We had been there once seventeen days ago. Although the three department stores had reopened, they had already closed at this time. When we went in to take a look, we saw only empty cabinets and wooden shelves with nothing on them—the owners had packed up their goods and ran home. They used to be like this, but they always had to wait until five or six o'clock. After the light of the Japanese Sun Goddess Amaterasu shone, the Japanese sought a living in this area, building wooden huts as small as cages, selling "draft beer" and Sakola, selling clothes and daily necessities, and even small furniture. This scene was everywhere in the Northeast, as long as there were Japanese residents. They sold things to make a living, and some women eventually had to sell themselves. In Changchun, the streets near the three department stores were crowded with such people. The Russian term "Upper Market" is still used now. During the Four Horse Pavilion, you only had to tell the driver, and he would take you to this place.</p>
<p>When we went to take a look that day, the scene was much worse than before. After the upheaval, it is not easy for any place to recover. Later, we ran into a small Japanese-run coffee shop, which looked like an ancient temple, with dim lights. When they saw us coming, a group of Japanese women were very busy. When we looked around the corner of the room, we actually found two other customers: two soldiers were drinking silently. But in less than five minutes, they slipped away.</p>
<p>Our car was inserted with a small red flag with the four characters "Jilin Military Region" on it, and it was carrying Americans in military uniforms, Chinese people in civilian clothes, and was protected by armed guards. Passersby cast strange glances.</p>
<p>Wooden arches are being built at many squares and road intersections, with wooden boards nailed into vertical walls and then painted. Many Chinese and Japanese people are working hard. When we came out again three or four days later, they were already gilded and resplendent.</p>
<p>The three of us still returned to our residence in a cold and desolate state. The impression we got was like this, but we boasted a lot in public, making it fascinating. Later, we all visited that small coffee shop. Later, we also discovered a dance hall called "Angel," which had Japanese dancers. According to Liu Ke, dancers are unproductive and should be prohibited in principle, but they cannot be prohibited until they have been given a proper occupation to solve their lives.</p>
<p>It was not until May 1st that we saw a bit of what spring looks like, which is unimaginable in the South. In this section, what we are trying to write is the first impression we got after Changchun was occupied by the Communist army. We started to retrieve "Northeast Bank Notes" worth one yuan and ten yuan issued by the Communist army from the hands of people who did business.</p>
<h3>Worker University</h3>
<p>On April, a piece of news titled "Northeast Workers University Actively Preparing for Enrollment" appeared in the Northeast Daily. The news content is as follows: ""This newspaper reported that Northeast Workers University has now selected the puppet Manchukuo "Imperial Household Agency" as its school site, and is actively preparing for enrollment. There are more than three morning of students, all of whom are industrial workers in the electrical industry, railways, technicians, and other industries. They are currently repairing the new school site, and the students are doing it themselves. The work mood is very high. Many people said, 'I never dreamed that I would live in this place today.' According to Principal Wang, they are continuing to recruit students, and will send hundreds of students within days to help with the city's labor movement and other mass work. The school also plans to workers' daily to reflect the learning, life, and demands of workers, and will be published on 'May Day' Labor Day."</p>
<p>After lunch on May 3rd, the three of us and accompanied by Liu Ke went to the "Imperial Household Agency". At the entrance of the Imperial Household Agency, there was a brand new oil paint sign with white characters on a blue background, hanging on the sentry box, with the four characters "Workers University" written on it. There were soldiers guarding it. Our initial intention was just to come and see Puyi's palace and the stage set of the puppet regime. We ran around everywhere, and occasionally some rooms were inhabited by a few Communist soldiers, but otherwise we hardly saw anyone. This large building was simply emptied, because it was really a concentrated target. We found a palace wall that had been torn open, and a small railway track was built through it for hand carts to run, which was definitely not installed by the Communist army this time, but a relic from a considerable time ago.</p>
<p>The soldiers here wore a kind of badge, a symbol of the Communist army, which was the first time we had seen it. The symbol was white with red, black, and blue characters, namely the four characters "Workers University". Several fifteen or sixteen year old children were eating, also wearing this symbol. We asked Liu Ke, "Are they the university students here?" Liu replied, "No, nothing is ready here."</p>
<p>While we were running around, a Communist soldier who seemed to be an officer, wearing a pistol and also wearing the Workers University symbol, suddenly came and said to us:</p>
<p>"Where did you come from? You came in without informing us. How can you take pictures casually without permission?" - A bunch of officialdom.</p>
<p>We replied to him, asking him to talk to Liu Ke. Liu Ke stepped forward to explain, but that gentleman still seemed unhappy.</p>
<p>The Northeast used to have developed enterprises and a considerable number of industrial workers. Now, absorbing them into "university" is really something that they "never dreamed of in the past". They are clearly engaged in the training of Communist Party ideology, rather than an academic university.</p>
<p>Another university that appeared in Changchun was Northeast University, with Zhang Xuesi as the president and Bai Xiqing and Shu as the vice presidents. We only saw the recruitment advertisement and nothing else. The advertisement said: School address: Changchun, with a branch school in Jilin. Enrollment quota: Expected 500 people, 200 undergraduates in the medical school, 300 each in the College of Natural Sciences, the College of Social Sciences, and the College of Arts. The number of places in the research institute is unlimited, but can undertake qualifications or specialized technical equivalent academic ability to apply for the exam.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of organizing "militia", we only saw it in the newspaper. The Northeast Daily on April 30th carried the following news: "Not Afraid of Thug Threats, Village Chief Tian Actively Organizes "Militia"":</p>
<p>"〔Bao Xun〕After Tian Fushun, a farmer representative from Qingyi District, was elected as the village chief by all the villagers, he was busy day and night doing things for the people. The bad elements in the village were not happy to see this. One night, while he was finishing his official business and lying down after returning home, three thugs shouted his name outside the door with axes, wanting his life. He hurriedly got up (since he was elected as village chief, he had been preventing bad people, so he did not take off his clothes when he slept at night), also picked up an axe, and loudly replied at the door, "When did I owe you my life? Tell me clearly, and I will pay you back. If you want money, I don't have much, but I have ten or eight yuan. Come and get it!" When the three thugs heard that things were not going well, they slipped away. Afterwards, not only was this village chief not intimidated by the thugs, but his work became even more active. He also felt that such things would definitely happen again in the future, so he actively organized the militia. In four days, he developed 23 people and asked the district to issue earth guns for self-defense." As for the captured security forces, the Communist army has reorganized them into "new soldiers" and has become "soldiers". According to the Northeast Daily on May 3rd, the article "Visiting the Prisoners of the Qian Shi Troop" on May 3rd wrote: "When serving as soldiers in the Republic of China, the officials were fighting for territory, and the soldiers did not know what they were fighting for; during the puppet Manchukuo, the troops were everywhere inside and outside the customs, fighting "bandits". After that central army, they still fought "bandits". After I joined the Eighth Route Army, the officers and soldiers are the same, and I admire them very much." The reporter then interviewed the prisoners who had been incorporated into the new soldiers: just walking to the door and seeing a group of soldiers in gray uniforms playing ball, you know that they must be the prisoners of the "Iron Stone Troop", so I immediately asked one of the soldiers: "How is it here?" That soldier was stunned, and after a pause, replied: "How is it! You can be free, you see us playing ball."</p>
<p>On April 25th, Changchun had electricity again, Chongqing shells, and trams began to run smoothly, but the Chinese and Soviet personnel of the China Chang Railway Company all withdrew to Harbin that day. Because "these railways belong to the Chinese people" (Zhou Baozhong's words), the Communist army took them over, and the Yamato Hotel was renamed the "Foreigner Hotel". According to the announcement, the Communist army now controls 1,300 to 1,400 kilometers of railways in East Manchuria, and 900 to 1,000 kilometers in both Manchurias.</p>
<p>The newspaper on May 3rd published a telegram from Yan'an on the 29th, saying that "the Northeast Democratic Allied Army peacefully entered Harbin on the 28th." At the end of April, preparations began to be made to hold a "Celebration of the Victory over Bandits and a Memorial Meeting for the Fallen Soldiers and the Masses". When we passed through our district, we only saw that the newspaper had changed the name to "Celebration of the Victory in Defending Peace", and 42 slogans were specially formulated, including the 26th: "800,000 Changchun citizens unite to defend Changchun!"</p>
<p>In the past, when the Communist army attacked Changchun, 800,000 citizens did not "unite", and the people were still running around calling for a ceasefire. The old people who died and were injured under the fire were still in the thousands. This time, if the government army comes to attack Changchun again, 800,000 citizens will have to "unite". How? Naturally, it is to "defend Changchun". This is the difference between the government and the Communist army. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Beetle-Type Automobile</h3>
<p>Potentially Becoming a Home, Equipped with Kitchen and Other Facilities</p>
<p>Unprecedented Comfort</p>
<p>According to a discussion by Stout of Graham-Paige Motors, the new type of automobile can become a mobile home. The seats in the car can be moved around at will. During the day, there are comfortable and movable chairs and folding tables. At night, it can become a comfortable bedroom.</p>
<p>Stout is the manufacturer of the "Stout Scarab" automobile. The Scarab is built according to his ideals, with the car engine mounted in the rear.</p>
<p>The Scarab "debuted" eight years ago, but its achievements and development have always been kept secret. The inventor of the car is currently the chief engineer of Graham-Paige Motors. After traveling 200,000 miles in the Scarab, Stout said, "I have thoroughly tested my car. Although there are many differences between it and my ideals, I have learned what should be retained and what should be discarded." It uses an ordinary engine, the size and weight of which are the same as ordinary engines. Therefore, the rear of the car is larger and higher, and there is no space for luggage except inside the car. It is only slightly more economical than ordinary cars, "but its comfort is unprecedented."</p>
<p>There is a fireproof wall between the engine and the car body. This wall prevents heat and noise from entering the car and forms the backrest of the seat or berth. The interior of the car is flat and wide, five to eight inches, and about ten feet long.</p>
<p>In front of the rear seats, there are two chairs that can be moved at will. The chairs are inclined. The seat surface is made of "foam rubber," and the armrests are wide and comfortable. The floor of the car is entirely made of thick carpet, which is no different from a living room. The driver's seat is the same as ordinary ones, and the driver's seat and the body are coordinated. It is extremely convenient for the driver to enter and exit. A door is also provided for guests to enter and exit on the side behind the car.</p>
<p>Stout said, "On uneven roads, we travel seventy miles per hour. People in the car, except for the driver, sit around the table to eat and drink."</p>
<p>"The new type of automobile may become a home, equipped with kitchen and other facilities. In any case, the car body is always wider, more comfortable, and more luxurious than ordinary ones." (Translated by American News)</p>
<h3>Guangxi People Turn Tears into Laughter at the Right Time</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Guangzhou Air Dispatch, This Newspaper, 22nd</p>
<p>Strange and bizarre things are like a bottle of poison being poured everywhere, dripping down bit by bit, colorful and beautiful. Onlookers feel a little dizzy and shaken. It turns out that there is a "Cultural Liaison Association" in Guilin, which has been established for several months. At first, there was indeed no friendship to be linked, but recently, it has become a mess of discussion. And this mess has indeed greatly discounted the great expectations of those who had great expectations for it (such as reporters).</p>
<h3>A Storm, Onlookers Split Their Sides Laughing</h3>
<p>The story must start from the beginning: on "May Fourth" Day, the gentlemen of the Liaison Association held a warm memorial hall in the auditorium of the Teachers College Affiliated Middle School. Many "cultural figures" who had never heard of their names came. Some were constantly weeping, some were full of indignation, and after the principles of "democracy" were routinely performed, a gentleman suddenly waved his arm and raised his head, shouting loudly: "Chinese people should not accept foreign (especially American) relief." His words implied that if they accepted relief, China would be poisoned and die immediately. Then he said: "Relief is a deceptive thing. Hoover came to China to help the reactionaries to lure us. This kind of relief has sugar coating on the outside and poison inside." What a wonderful theory! The speaker, known as Wei Lin, is the editor of "Democratic Weekly" and has quite a bit of money at home. It is said that he is non-partisan. However, as soon as his theory came out, the "Guangxi Daily" reported the next day that "listeners were all surprised." The day after that, the editorial of the Central Daily News pointed out sharply: "This is a total exposure of the true face of the most inhuman neo-fascism." Readers wrote letters to various halls, accusing this Mr. Jin, who "sits at home eating comfortably and does not know the immensity of heaven and earth," of talking nonsense. After Mr. Jin read it, he immediately became furious and immediately made a serious correction, as if saying: "I didn't say a word." Then, their headquarters—the Cultural Liaison Association—sent out an ultimatum, demanding an apology from the newspaper, otherwise it would be terrible. Seeing that there was no response, they then sent out express mail telegrams, distributing them everywhere, truly in a state of "either you die or I die." It is said that they are still preparing to sue. A storm really made the onlookers split their sides laughing. Is it right to say that the Cultural Liaison Association is right? It is a bit of a conscience to listen to. Is it wrong to say that it is wrong? The Cultural Liaison Association is flying the banner of "democracy." It is indeed inconvenient to criticize it. In short, it is not just Mr. Jin who says that China should not accept relief. Until today, this case is still making a mess, but everyone's feeling towards things like the "Cultural Liaison Association" and "Democratic Weekly" is indeed a bit more than "just annoying."</p>
<h3>Squeezing the Soybean Dregs Dry, Where Will 50,000 Tons of Grain Come From?</h3>
<p>No matter how people who don't touch the edge of things talk nonsense, disaster relief work cannot be stopped for a moment. When the grain supply was about to run out, fortunately, a timely rain saved many cracked fields. The late planting naturally also means a late harvest. (It still depends on God's blessing and good weather). At least new grain will be available in late July. What will happen during this period of scarcity? In three months, assuming there are 3.5 million disaster victims, this is a minimum estimate, then at least 145,000 to 150,000 tons of grain are needed to barely survive the disaster period. Guangxi is currently a piece of tofu dregs that has been squeezed dry. Where will 150,000 tons of surplus grain come from? Naturally, we can only rely on the Relief Administration, but the Relief Administration currently has only 3,000 tons of flour and 400,000 pounds of rice that have been shipped in and are still in transit. Speaking of which, one really wants to sigh: "What should we do?" So, we have no choice but to desperately launch a disaster relief movement ourselves. Disaster relief associations have been established in various places. The Guilin Disaster Relief Committee held a charity sale. Chairman Huang also donated an ancient inkstone. In the end, it only sold for more than 400,000 yuan in total. The newspaper also sold for more than 600,000 yuan. Adding it all up, it is not even enough to buy 100 dan of rice. The only hope is that the Relief Administration will increase relief supplies. Then, may Amitabha Buddha be with us.</p>
<h3>Using Flowery Words to Cover Up the Crime of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>The most infuriating thing is the worst phenomenon when relief supplies are distributed. There are quite a few counties that have received relief supplies, but nine out of ten are still delayed in distributing them to this day. Some even take them and sell them, saying they are building water conservancy projects, using a lot of flowery words, hoping to cover up the crime of embezzlement. Some counties have distributed them, but the refugees each receive only ten or eight liang, while the "work remuneration" of the staff can be as much as forty or fifty jin of flour. Moreover, they openly use flour as gambling stakes and engage in large-scale debauchery, not caring about the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<p>The refugees in Lipu County, Guidong, did not receive flour, so they ran to the county government to cry and petition, but the county magistrate accused them of "rebellion," mobilized the police, surrounded the refugees, beat them up, and arrested the leaders from various places to "kill one as a warning to a hundred." Ah! What a democratic era of the all-powerful local tyrant!</p>
<p>The cries and sufferings of the ordinary people who have suffered heavy disasters are like scattered pieces of paper spread all over the world. The distribution of relief supplies is just one of the thousands of tricks. Treating the refugees like pigs and dogs is very common. There are many things that can be said at length in a long night talk. There are indeed honest and people-loving officials, but this is somewhat reminiscent of the story of finding gold in the sand. Ordinary people starve to death and can only blame heaven. Dying a death that is more painful than starvation certainly cannot but blame people!</p>
<p>In the past two years in Guangxi, things have been quietly changing and rapidly evolving. When will the people who have no tears to shed be able to truly smile?</p>

<h3>The Yell of a Soldier</h3>
<p>Editor: Our troops have been given a special "special" character in the past. It is because of this "special" character that we wore old cotton uniforms in the summer and single cloth shirts in the winter. However, our supervisor is really good, which you might not believe. In the twelfth lunar month, he cut off the lower half of his own lined long gown, added some cotton, and made vests for the soldiers. At that time, we were indeed suffering. I remember that once, when we were surrounded by the enemy, from noon on the first day to dusk on the second day, we had nothing to eat and were a little unbearable. Being able to sleep on some straw at night was considered a "golden silk quilt." Of course, soldiers should suffer during the Anti-Japanese War. Now—now we have won. Although we dare not stand up straight and take a deep breath, we still have a little hope. The first thing that made us happy was the distribution of victory bonuses. A captain could receive 30,000 yuan. Last year, this number was considerable, but because of "pending reasons," it was not issued. "Complying with this" was wrong, and it was not issued until now. "Pending reasons" means that it is definitely going to be issued, but "complying with this" only allows half of it to be issued. I was very happy to take the seal to collect this "half victory bonus" that had been pending since last year, but the quartermaster smiled and said to me: "Your victory bonus has been removed by order of the above." The reason is that the troops were reorganized and placed in another unit in the same organization. A soldier who fought in the Anti-Japanese War for eight years had his victory bonus removed for this reason. Moreover, he was the one who was reorganized. Of course, I am not the only one, and it is not a big deal. Our treatment is 25,000 yuan for a captain, plus three dou of coarse rice, which covers all expenses. Needless to say, the soldiers' treatment is even worse. We often hear about pay raises, but "we only hear footsteps on the stairs, but we don't see anyone coming down." Even if it is a supplementary issue, although it will not suffer the same bad luck as the victory bonus, by that time, the banknotes may shrink again. Under this high-pressure life, we are really breathless. Please expose this in your newspaper and beg the adults and gentlemen to save us poor soldiers! Sincerely, Shouyi.</p>
<h3>Will Telecommunication Rights Still Be Lost?</h3>
<p>Editor: It is rumored that three foreign submarine cable companies—namely, British Great Eastern, Danish Great Northern, and American Pacific—are about to resume operations. Their reasons for requesting resumption are, naturally, the same as the foreign shipping companies' excuse that Chinese ships are not enough for transportation. They say that international radio stations are congested, often causing delays. They are coming in good faith to serve and share the burden. It is currently unknown what attitude the transportation and foreign affairs authorities will take on this matter. I hope that a matter involving national rights will not be treated carelessly, right?</p>
<p>I remember that after the First World War, at the Pacific Conference held in Washington, my country fought hard to recover postal and telecommunication rights. After spending a lot of effort, the post offices of various countries in China were finally abolished. In telecommunications, only the wireless radio stations were resolved to be abolished, and the submarine cable part was not resolved because the contract term had not expired at that time. Later, it was not until the Nationalist government moved to Nanjing that the telecommunication transmission and reception part was recovered after several negotiations. After Japan declared war on Britain and the United States, the three companies simultaneously ceased operations. Now, calculating the contract term, according to people in the company, it has long expired. Moreover, wireless radio is now developed, so why bother with these outdated submarine cable methods? Even if there is a need to restore them, we would like to handle it ourselves. Why let others do it for us again? If the expired rights are returned as they are, wouldn't it be a joke?</p>
<p>Regarding the shipping issue, people in the shipping industry have shouted loudly to draw attention to the government and the public. Why is no one paying attention to this telecommunication right? I hope people in the telecommunication industry will quickly stand up and fight for it.</p>
<p>However, I still have one suggestion: I hope that those who work in international telecommunications will also work hard for the country and strive for speed in transmission and reception. They should also reduce errors in telegrams (I heard that there are many errors in international transmission and reception, and the transmission is slow, which is often criticized by foreigners) so as not to give others an excuse.

<h3>Beethoven's Two Masterpieces</h3>
<p>— Reckless</p>
<p>Ludwig van Beethoven was a musical composer in the transitional period between the Classical and Romantic periods of the nineteenth century. He was born in Bonn, Germany, in 1770. Although his father was a drunkard, he paid attention to Beethoven's musical education from a young age. From childhood, he had the reputation of a musical prodigy. However, poverty and illness dominated his life, but at the same time, it was full of rich and lingering love. His works had many relationships with women. He died of illness in a Vienna residence in 1827 at the age of fifty-seven, which is considered short-lived in the West. He has many works, including nine symphonies, several model pieces, and string quartets in instrumental music, and masses in choral music and nine symphonies in operas.</p>
<p>I have heard a C major model piece and an F minor model piece, and I am fascinated by them. Now I would like to introduce them:</p>
<p>The first piece is the C major Waldstein Sonata, and the second piece is the F minor Appassionata Sonata. These famous songs are not easy to hear in China. The C major model piece was a gift that Beethoven gave to Count Waldstein. Waldstein was a descendant of a famous general in the Thirty Years' War, with a generous and heroic personality. This piece depicts Waldstein's character and deeds vividly. The heroic spirit, the generous and tragic feelings, the sweeping power, and the outstanding demeanor all depict the characteristics of the descendants of famous generals. In the middle andante section, he wrote about Waldstein looking up at the sky and contemplating silently, solemn and solemn, and desolate throughout. In the wind section, the roar is long and loud. Listening quietly with your eyes closed, it is like being in a midnight high-rise building, shaking your heart.</p>
<p>The passionate F minor model piece is even greater than the first piece. This piece was a gift that Beethoven gave to Count Brunsvik. In 1806, the Count's daughter, Teresa, was engaged to Beethoven. Beethoven's general enthusiasm for Teresa is embodied in this piece. From beginning to end, the whole piece is full of passion. Some people have said that it is like the bursting of the earth, erupting and impacting the sky. Beethoven himself also said: To understand this piece, you must first read Shakespeare's Tempest, which shows the power of this piece. This piece sometimes sounds like a mountain collapsing and the earth cracking, sometimes like ten thousand thunders roaring, sometimes like autumn waves surging, and sometimes like a moonlight march, making you breathless and unable to distinguish your senses. Sometimes, because your senses are too tired, you lean back on the seat and want to fall asleep, but the sound of ten thousand horses galloping in your ears makes you unable to fall asleep. Beethoven's spirit is so majestic that it is amazing, especially for Chinese people who are naturally sweet and indifferent, and who are accustomed to delicate, gentle, and peaceful melodies such as "Xiao Xiang Night Rain" and "Nine Autumn Colors." This kind of crystallization of Western culture, which is more vigorous, will indeed make you speechless.</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>— Yang Qiguang</p>
<p>I am unwilling to leave you, but I have to leave you. Who is not infatuated with the beauty of their hometown's mountains and rivers! But, can't the sound of shackles all over this land still make you alert?</p>
<p>Even if you don't say it, I know it all: how did humanity create history? Little by little. It is all intertwined with loud laughter and low sobs. Who doesn't have a red heart beating in their chest? When you leave this land of disaster, there are so many sad stories for you to chew on, enough for you to be angry about.</p>
<p>At that time, I followed a series of majestic songs and embarked on a long journey, like a summer afternoon nap, the surroundings were very hot, but I finally patted the dust off my body, began to step on the scaly mountains, and wade through the forests that stood like swords against the sky. I held up my throat, and I sang with them the greatness of the era.</p>
<p>But time is the most ruthless thing. In the past few years, I have watched those strong people, like camels, buried in the wind and sand, and those light people, like swallows, disappear in the shade of the trees. In the beginning, who didn't boast that they were as green as pine and cypress? But after a burst of storm, those who couldn't stand the beating fell into the dust. Those majestic songs were destroyed by the suffering and grinding, and a pale and bloody smile appeared under the dark green light, like a ghost.</p>
<p>At that time, I felt pain in disappointment. A beautiful deception broke my pure heart. I seemed to hear someone whispering, "Alas! A poor fool!"</p>
<p>"God, I saw myself in the calm and still water, and my face, which had lost its brilliance due to suffering, was now as old as an old man. I can't laugh. I don't know who deceived me. I just stand futilely on the steep hill, sending away a series of radiant days, without even the courage to take a step.</p>
<p>Time is a promising and fair ruler. Who is not timid in front of him? People are saying: "Time is running desperately!" But time is not running, is it? People are running themselves! Some squeeze to the front nimbly, while others squeeze to the back. But time pays the bravest with misfortune and falling, using all kinds of suffering to grind him, causing him to grow a full head of white hair? But it also tolerates those who drag behind and watch the brave people fall into the bottomless abyss, and is stingy with a little sigh. So, people no longer have the majestic singing like rivers, the green color like pine and cypress, or the broad shoulders like ancient hero statues.</p>
<p>You say: How did God create human history, drop by drop, all intertwined with loud laughter and low sobs. And me? I am walking in the vast and boundless wind and rain, holding a candle of life in one hand. I silently endure the emptiness and pain added to my body.</p>
<p>Kazayev shouted in the novel "Time, Forward!": "Everything is moving from its place, everything is starting!"</p>
<p>I think, if I want to eradicate the feeling of emptiness and pain, perhaps I have to "start" again!</p>
<h3>Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Fei Cun</p>
<p>When I was a young boy, I realized what sorrow was. In the dormitory of primary school, bathed in the faint sunlight of the autumn afternoon, I heard the whistling of the small steamboats sailing to my hometown in the long river next to the school, and my little heart was covered with a layer of deep sorrow. That sorrow, which I used to describe with the words in Wang Duzhi and Dafu's poems, was the so-called nostalgia.</p>
<p>From boy to youth, the rich girls in the rich spring became the cause of my sorrow. On a drunken southern wind night, the melodious piano music and crisp singing overflowing from the green shade and the red building in the corner once aroused my great reverie! As a result of the reverie, I first sighed "Spring sorrow darkens my sleepless nights." It was another kind of pain.</p>
<p>Although it is said that "the sorrow of parting is the most painful", after all, sorrow can be quite poetic when you are idle. Some people like to immerse themselves in sorrow and enjoy a kind of sentimental pleasure, am I one of them?</p>
<p>The years pass quickly, and suddenly I am middle-aged. During the day, I rush around, wearing a gray coat, and at night, I often have coughs and night sweats. "Wife also says, Heaven does not understand people," in the family letters that are worth ten thousand gold, it is always the same old story: "The child is sick, the rice jar at home is running out, and all the clothes are so torn that they can't be patched up…" What kind of homesickness or spring sorrow has long been crushed by the heavy burden of reality. Now what sticks to my heart all day long is: poverty! So tight, so heavy!</p>
<p>Thinking of how I could write thousands of words without stopping when I was young, but now I stare blankly at the paper, unable to start, I only then began to understand what kind of state Xin Jiaxuan's line "Now I know all the taste of sorrow, but I want to say but I don't" means.</p>
<h3>Sympathy</h3>
<p>— Deng Lin</p>
<p>Unable to see the beautiful sunset, nor the bright moon. It is said that this is the reason why the blind evoke the sympathy of humanity.</p>
<p>The things in the world that deserve sympathy are not limited to this. A song from heaven, the deaf cannot hear; a heart full of sorrow and indignation, the aphasic cannot speak. Even a tearful encounter, a tragic drama, is not enough to make people feel pity. Only with these imperfections does humanity develop sympathy. Otherwise, the world would seem too bland, and life too monotonous.</p>
<p>"However, what will arouse your sincere sympathy?" I asked, wanting to test my friend.</p>
<p>"This?" he replied, "It must be the disabled! They do not receive the blessings bestowed by God, they do not receive the favor bestowed by God..."</p>
<p>"No!" I laughed.</p>
<p>"Then it must be a group of orphans who have lost their homes, they have lost the warmth of family, they have lost the comfort of a loving mother..."</p>
<p>"Also no!" I smiled: "They are worthy of sympathy, but they will not arouse your true sympathy."</p>
<p>"Oh! I know," he pondered for a moment: "You are talking about the sorrow of young people! A young person who has lost the song of life. His life suddenly lost the gentle spring water..."</p>
<p>"Even more no!" I laughed loudly: "Although you speak well, you are not accurate. Let me tell you! It does not appear in such a grand scene, nor does it appear at such a moving moment. It only appears in the most subtle moments but can be applied very broadly." He stared straight at me.</p>
<p>"When a person is suffering from a toothache, when you have just gotten a toothache."</p>
<p>Human nature is innate. Being indifferent to the disabled. The loneliness of wandering on the wrong path is only a vague feeling for those with families. Although they also have sympathy, this sympathy lasts only a day, an hour, even a minute or a second. Afterwards, it seems like a flash in the pan, leaving no trace.</p>
<p>I recall a friend's words: Only in the same environment, in the same situation, can true sympathy be born.</p>
<h3>Partridge Sky</h3>
<p>— Shen Yinmo</p>
<p>The weather shifts in my mountain residence in April, cuckoos sing amongst the azaleas, ripples gradually unfold on the glazed tiles, the color of the trees distinctly form emerald curtains. White clouds drift leisurely, interweaving with thin clothes, new feelings stir old lyrics, after not much wind and rain passing with clouds, again, light clouds carry floating silk.</p>
<h3>Fishing</h3>
<p>— An Shou</p>
<p>Besides small streams, there are no large rivers in the mountain village, and the sea is out of the question. Although this is a county near the sea, it is separated from our village by several mountains.</p>
<p>Fishing alone is not very interesting, two or three people are best, more than that is not good. To be honest, I am ashamed to say that my fishing is unworthy of the name. I can't even handle the fishing line. So-called fishing is just going to the waterside with friends to have some fun.</p>
<p>The most annoying thing about fishing is the sun, and the next is the wind. No one has planted willows by the waterside in the mountain village, so the pleasure of "fishing in the shade of willows" is difficult to enjoy. When the sun is fierce, you will almost jump up from being burned by the sunlight if you don't wear a bamboo hat. The wind will destroy the tranquil environment, and the intense fluctuations of the water and the shaking of the fishing rod will make it impossible to calm your mind.</p>
<p>The best time to fish is when the setting sun is about to fall, you can rest assured of the sun, and the fish are also more likely to be hooked. I often like to choose two kinds of places to fish, one is shallow streams with yellow sand underneath, and the other is deep pools with swift currents. The former takes its quiet tranquility, and the latter takes its dynamic grandeur.</p>
<p>The streamside is also very poetic. Looking around, there are green forests and tender grass, mixed with a few wildflowers, and herds of cattle and sheep, like a painting.</p>
<p>However, a fish struggling on the beach is an unpleasant thing. Every time I return with an empty rod, it is still a good way to cultivate one's character. It would be great if I could buy a glass tank someday and raise a few fish. How interesting would it be to have slender and fat fish?</p>
<h3>Farewell Ode</h3>
<p>— Gan Ge</p>
<p>The boat crosses the river, suddenly seeing the clouds of the homeland gradually disappear into the horizon. Going abroad, I will not see the spires of the ancient temples again. People say: "It's easy to say goodbye, but hard to meet again." How can you know that I cannot immediately ride the wind and return, silently admiring the grandeur of the Buddha once more? But when the blue sea reflects the colorful clouds on the horizon, suddenly seeing the seagulls soaring up and down, the treasure of Guanyin closely follows, sending me off from afar.</p>
<h3>May</h3>
<p>— Fu Bo</p>
<p>May, the pomegranate flowers are red again!</p>
<p>During that season, I was also fascinated, I also had a flame as red as pomegranate flowers, like most young people. In the burning of this flame, I also had a life filled with hope and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>However, today, after the pomegranate flowers have withered and bloomed several times, I have extinguished that red flame, I have suppressed my hopes, and I have cooled my enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The charming breeze can no longer stir my heart, but the poetic dusk makes me recapture the scars of the past. I use tears to replace bottomless sorrow.</p>
<p>I ask my friend who knows my vicissitudes: "Was I wrong about the matter of love?"</p>
<p>"You were not wrong, you just harmed her and made yourself suffer."</p>
<p>Yes, I just harmed her and made myself suffer:</p>
<p>Four years ago, in a certain month, I was wounded in battle and retreated from the battlefront back to my hometown. She also followed me back to take care of me. Bearing the pain, in the nourishment of love, I spent two difficult Mays, and she buried her youth in my sickroom.</p>
<p>However, I knew that she still had the youthful feelings of pomegranate flowers, and she still had the courage to fight. How could I bear to break her wings? So, with the help of friends, I wiped away my tears and let her go, and sent her on her journey again.</p>
<p>But, in the second year that she soared in the free air, she sacrificed her life for the country. It was I who harmed her, it was I who sent her away...</p>
<p>From then on, hiding endless tears of repentance, like withered pomegranate flowers, I have no hope, no enthusiasm, and I have lost my youth.</p>
<h3>Flying Together (39)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo's fatalistic remarks initially surprised Mrs. Weng the Second, because in her memory, Mrs. Mo had always been assertive and insightful. But today, she had actually changed, becoming more thoughtful and weaker. Then, after Mrs. Mo also talked about her grievances, Mrs. Weng understood that Mrs. Mo's heart had also been deeply affected by Mr. Mo's death and Zhang Mengyan's disobedience, so her outlook on life was not as positive as before! A person, if emotionally affected repeatedly, will lose confidence! That is how Mrs. Mo is now. Although Mrs. Mo cannot give Mrs. Weng the Second advice as before, Mrs. Weng still needs her comfort! Comfort is a power that increases her courage to live. Mrs. Weng the Second's environment is also not like before. In the past, Mrs. Weng the Second had to conquer her environment; Mrs. Mo acted as her commander in "conquering the environment." Now, Mrs. Weng the Second can only adapt to her environment, so Mrs. Mo should teach her to accept her fate! In short, Mrs. Mo has always been a leader in Mrs. Weng the Second's spiritual realm, and Mrs. Mo's influence on Mrs. Weng the Second is too great. However, Mrs. Weng the Second can also influence Mrs. Mo in the same way.</p>
<p>While they were getting into the mood, Li Yun and Li Hua, the young sisters, were also having a great time playing in the outer room. They were beginning to feel interested in this new environment. Especially Li Yun, who looked at everything in this room with great joy, while Li Hua was full of curiosity. They looked at the various framed photos hanging on the wall. Li Yun could recognize that the person in the photo was Shi Yu Lou, but Li Hua had no impression. This was precisely why Li Hua felt very curious.</p>
<p>"Is he a man?" Li Hua asked Li Yun, half believing and half doubting.</p>
<p>"Yes, he is a man. When he sings, he looks like a woman. Not only does he wear women's clothes, but even his voice and the way he walks are like a woman's." Li Yun remembered describing Shi Yu Lou to Li Hua, and she was very proud because she knew more than Li Hua.</p>
<p>"That's really strange!" Li Hua said, pausing for a moment. Suddenly, she innocently asked Li Yun, "So now your mother is living with this strange person? Is he your father too?"</p>
<p>"This, I don't know."</p>
<p>Li Yun couldn't answer and quickly changed the subject, leading Li Hua to look at the huqin and those guns, knives, bows, and swords. She didn't think about these unclear questions. Unlike Li Hua, who would carefully consider these unclear questions in her mind.</p>
<p>Just then, that strange person appeared before the young sisters.</p>
<p>Shi Yu Lou came back from the theater and was a little stunned when he saw the two children. Then, recognizing Li Yun, he knew that Mrs. Mo and the others had arrived.</p>
<p>"Xiao Yun, do you still recognize me?" Shi Yu Lou said, stroking Li Yun's head.</p>
<p>"I do!" Li Yun said, and then smiled and told Li Hua, "Sister Hua, it's him!"</p>
<p>"What's 'it's me'?" Shi Yu Lou looked at these innocent children and found it amusing.</p>
<p>"The person in the photo is you, right?" Li Yun asked Shi Yu Lou, pointing to the stage photo on the wall.</p>
<p>"That's right! You're so smart! How could you recognize that it was me?"</p>
<p>"Because I've seen you perform, you look like this when you perform," Li Yun said, without any restraint, as if she were very familiar with Shi Yu Lou.</p>
<p>Li Hua didn't say a word, only paying attention to Shi Yu Lou. She had never seen Shi Yu Lou's performance, so she simply couldn't believe that what Li Yun had just told her was true. Because the Shi Yu Lou standing in front of her now didn't look like a woman at all.</p>
<p>"Who is she?" Shi Yu Lou asked Li Yun, seeing Li Hua staring blankly at the side.</p>
<p>"She is my goddaughter!" Mrs. Weng the Second answered, as Mrs. Mo came out from the inner room.</p>
