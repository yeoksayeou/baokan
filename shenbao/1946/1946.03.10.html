<h3>東北新局面蛻變中　瀋陽城區大火處處　傳蘇軍已全部他調</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日加急電〕重慶訊：關於瀋陽一部蘇軍，自七日起開始撤退之消息，業經證實，但官方尙未接獲正式通知。據此間消息靈通者言：一日蘇軍突然自瀋陽撤退，此際虎視耽耽於瀋陽郊外之共軍，其態度極堪注意，因軍事調處之權力，尙未到達東北，而日來由熱察兩省轉進東北之共軍，顯已獲得某種支援，正在期待一新機運。果爾，則未來之東北新局勢，將於急管繁弦中揭開其序幕，大有可能。馬歇爾，張治中，周恩來，能吾即往東北，尙須視莫斯科之態度以爲斷，東北新局面正在徐徐蛻變中。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽九日急電〕瀋陽城區蘇軍，已全部他調，我軍正進行接防。城區現有數處起火，郊區共軍甚活躍，我軍盡力控制城防。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平九日電〕據自瀋陽返此美記者估計，瀋陽蘇軍約有六七千人，由史丹基維區指揮。駐瀋陽西城國軍至少一萬名，距城不遠，亦有國軍二萬名，另有數萬名，被阻於新民與大虎山。日本投降後，中共軍曾一度控制瀋陽，最近消息，傳距城七哩至十哩處，仍有中共軍數萬名盤踞。</p>
<p>〔本報長春八日電〕瀋陽八日急電，此間蘇軍昨起調動頻繁，坦克車大砲等重武器，成羣出現車站地區，並有重砲十四門，砲車三十餘輛，官兵多隊及大量軍用品，忙於裝車。車站昨午戒嚴，禁行人出入，迄今晚未解除。一般觀察，蘇軍似爲撤退，然我官方始終未獲通知。瀋陽郊區及鐵西區等地，蘇軍均已離去，我軍自動接防。按日前蘇方曾揚言，舉行大演習，此次移動，究屬演習性質，抑係撤退，或另有其他舉動，無人敢作斷言。目前瀋陽四週，均有共軍屯駐，蘇軍果係撤退，則彼等或將乘虛而入，亦未可知。</p>
<p>〔本報長春八日電〕瀋陽蘇軍北移訊傳出後，此間迄今日下午九時（重慶時間），猶未見有蘇軍車抵此。而長春車站，自七日起，即限制一般旅客進站，但通瀋客車照舊售票。又據息：哈爾演蘇軍，亦有移動模樣，南北皆現動勢中，但長春平穩如故。</p>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕長春發來供給官方參考之報吿云：現有種種跡象，顯示蘇軍已在開始撤退，或準備撇退。惟此說迄今尙未能正式證實。</p>
<h3>為蘇軍在東北行動　美對蘇再度抗議　馬歇爾下週奉召返美商討</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓九日電〕國務卿貝爾納斯昨表示，美政府於本週內，就蘇聯在滿洲之行動，向蘇政府提出之第二次抗議書，目前猶不能宣布之。美政府於二月九日曾致牒蘇政府，覆文甫經收到，故第三次之抗議書，因此被阻，渠猶不知該抗議書已吾送出。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓八日電〕國務卿貝爾納期本日在招待記者會中宣佈，美國已獲蘇聯對美國二月九日有關處置東北工業照會之覆文。貝爾納斯申明，此項覆文並非答覆彼於本週致送蘇聯之照會，而係答覆一爲時較早之咨文。〔又電〕杜魯門總統本日在招待記者會中稱：渠已請美國總統駐華特使馬歇爾將軍，從速返華盛頓，有所商議。總統稱；事後馬將軍仍將以特使資格赴華返任。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶九日電〕陪都各界預料馬歇爾特使將於本月十五日左右二中全會閉會後啓程返國述職；杜總統召回馬特使之主要原因，大的係討論東北情勢。據與三人小組接近人士稱：馬歇爾·張治中·周恩來三委員極盼親赴東北視察，惟目下不致實現。</p>
<p>〔合衆社本市九日訊〕合衆社特派員命特爾稱：在戰爭結束時，東北方而的有日本軍民一百六十萬人，蘇聯對於美國遣送此等日人返國之計劃不予合作，已成爲美蘇磨擦之另一新原因。鑒於此項工作之重要，美駐華特使馬歇爾將軍於下週返美時，大致將以此項問題向華府政界高級人士提出，蓋遣送工作之完成與吾，與中國戰區美國之復員極有關係。</p>
<h3>國際軍事法庭特委會將來華</h3>
<p>搜集日對華侵略戰證件</p>
<p>〔中央社東京九日電〕星條報載美方檢察長紀南之言，謂國際軍事法庭之特別委員會，將於本週杪首途前往中國，以便携回與日本對華侵略戰有關之證件，及佈置證人到庭作證事宜。紀南又謂，此委員會將與中國常局就日本違反條約，破壞法定義務，擅行侵略中國，致數十萬華人遭其屠殺一事，有所商榷。此委員會並將調查日軍在中國東北諸省作戰之全部事件，以及一九三七年日軍攻擊長江中英美砲艦之情形，此委員會到滬後，將稍停留，參加日人殺害美飛行家三人之審訊，且將襄助使南京暴行負責人日軍司令板垣，得早日解回日本。此委員會將有上海高等法院首席檢查官向哲熔在內。</p>
<h3>魏德邁暫不離華　昨在招待記者席上宣稱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美軍中國戰區總司令魏德邁將軍，昨日上午十一時半，在建設大廈招待記者，談話歷一小時又三刻之久。</p>
<p>東北問題不便表示</p>
<p>關於東北中蘇問題，魏將軍謂此係在馬歇爾元帥任務範圍內，本人不便作何表示。有傳派調處執行小組赴東北事，亦並無所聞。但確知馬歇爾元帥並不前往，而定本月十二日起程返美。在其離職期間，其任務是否由魏將軍代理，則尙未指定。某記者詢其對於報載蘇方不承認美記者赴東北之護照作何意見，魏將軍稱並未聞及，但其本人對於任何國家記者均平等待遇，希望他人亦有此態度。當有某美記者聲明其赴長春及瀋陽時曾出示美中國戰區所發證明書，均經蘇方承認，進行頗為滿意，但另一美記者則稱其在大連時情形正相反。　魏將軍又稱，某報載日僑間盛傳美蘇業已開戰，實係荒唐謠言，現代報紙決不可作此類不正確之報道。</p>
<p>遣送日人進行順利</p>
<p>目前遣送日人回國，進行極爲順利。中國職區美軍總部已遣回日人六十四萬二千人。三門　，汕頭及廈門三處，現已全部遣畢。合灣，海南島，廣東，越南之日人，均可於下月內遺畢。麥克阿瑟將軍已有週密準備，將送回之日人分運各地。現中國方面每月平均可遣送四十萬人左右。此外，於二月十四日前，已遣送華北朝鮮人六千人，三月四日前，將華中五千一百人遣畢。現尙有五萬六千朝鮮難民留華，則不在遣送之例，將山中國及朝鮮當局自行決定。至香港方面，則由英斐斯丁司令負責。關於東北日軍之遣運，魏將軍已電美政府明示其在華工作範圍及權限。</p>
<p>總部結束確期未定</p>
<p>中國戰區美軍總部可能於本年初夏即行結束，但確期須視工作情形而定。美軍總部之任務，乃在協助中國遣送日僑日俘，同時運送華軍至東北，但如中共停戰協定正式執行，則即可停止運兵。美軍俟日人遣送至相當程度，即可復員。至解散後是否每一美兵均能回國，魏將軍鄭重答覆，馬歇爾元帥乃美總統特使，來華負責助華解決經濟軍政各事，吾等爲協助其進行工作起見，如需繼續留此，則自應完成任務後再行返國。</p>
<p>魏將軍繼報吿，本星期三有若干美政府要員來滬處理美軍剩餘物資。</p>
<p>魏將軍肯定聲明，本月內返國消息，絕不可靠，且最近期內亦不擬前往東九省。</p>
<h3>外長王世杰</h3>
<p>有閉會前辭職說</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶九日電〕國民公報今日載稱：外長王世杰擬在二中全會閉會前辭職，益世報稱：二中全會閉會後，行政院長宋子文將往加拿大與美國一行。</p>
<h3>美駐華軍事顧問團　中美雙方批准成立　團址設南京·人員已陸續前往</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕魏德邁將軍，昨日宣佈美駐華軍事顧問團，已得中美雙方之批准而吿成立，團址爲南京，內部人選如下：</p>
<p>團長麥克魯將軍（少將，前任美駐華作戰司令部司令）參謀長冰克將軍，（准將，美戰區司令部參謀，戰爭時期，曾在各戰塲任要職），空軍訓練主任麥加多將軍，）准將，前任美空軍駐重慶主任，月州前自美返華），陸軍訓練主任麥克魯上校，（曾繼米都頓將軍任駐華幹訓團團長，本月五日自重慶抵滬，已於昨日赴南京），人事組柏柁上校，情報組麥載斯上校，戰略組加特里上校，交通組卡里茲上校。</p>
<p>以上人選均爲暫時性質，該團人數，將不超過七百五十人，任務爲帮助中國訓練軍隊，全是顧問性質，並非受僱於中國，亦非助中國軍隊作戰該人選團除一部爲美國常備軍外，餘爲志願軍，該團人員已陸續赴南京展開工作。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕定於本月十五日離滬赴南京之美國駐華</p>
<p>軍事顧問團參謀長冰克（Brink）將軍，昨午對記者稱：該團團長麥克魯將軍，在南京展開籌備工作，已有兩星期之久。</p>
<h3>黨政革新方案可望成立　全會續討論交通　對管理不啻會中多所質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕重慶訊：二中全會揭幕後，若干中委所倡之黨政革新運動，已獲得廣大同情，聞有多數中委主張，今後國民黨雖為一普通政黨，但歷史曁民族國家所賦予國民黨革命任務，則不容諉卸。因此，國民黨爲發楊黨德，提高黨譽，充實黨之革命精神計，首須恢復辛亥革命精神。黨員繳納之黨費，應全部用之於黨營文化事業曁一切有益工、農、平民之社會福利事業。黨部工作人員，應爲純義務職，以期造成「黨員誓願以血汗養黨」之崇高黨風。此議聞由若干靑年中委提出，獲得該黨多數老同志熱烈司情，成立具體方案後，可望通過。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶九日電〕二中全會今日上午九時舉行十一次會議，出席中委二〇六人。由白崇社主席，續討論交通問題。陳希豪、戴愧生、李中襄、王若僖、周異斌、潘公殿、苗培成、韋永成等發言，對交通管理，多所質詢，認最近工人罷工，即由管理不佳所致。又劉中央及中航</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶九日電〕二中全會今下午舉行十二次大會，到中央執監委員二七九人，鄒魯主席，何應欽等三十七委員臨時動機，關於善後救濟物資之分配，將黔省列入一案，經主席決定交善救審查委會併案審查。次為糧食報告之檢討，後由黃紹竑作地方政治報告，至六時餘散會。又全會全體委員定十日晨，在青年年館李追悼李烈鈞，葉楚傖，李夢庚三委員，下午舉行十三次大會。</p>
<h3>處理戰前公債辦法　俞財長答潘委員公展問</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶九日電〕二中全會三次財政金融報吿後，潘委員公展提出書面詢問案稱：上海證券投機市塲，以公債爲投機對像，故意搖傳政府將用孫票兌付戰前公債之本息，以爲抬價獲利之張本。財政部對此始終未見表示，一月以前，財部致電上海，對戰時各種公債一概還本付息，而對戰前公債，則謂另定辦法，於是謠言更甚，投機抬價更烈，究竟財政部對此有何計劃，有何辦法，請速決定公吿，以杜謠諑等語，已於八日晨得財部兪部長書面答覆。茲誌如後：查上海證券市場，自淪陷後，停頓已久，最近上海證券市場與黃金外匯市場，均爲黑市，謠言甚多，其他孫票兌付戰前公債本息一節，全係謠傳，本人曾已一再發表談話，吾認本部有發行孫幣之計劃。至所詢對戰時各種公債一概還付本息，戰前公債則另訂辦法一節，事實並非加此。按本部規定係民國三十年起，所行各債先在收復區照常縱續候付本息，至三十年以前發行各債，俟另訂辦法，因三十年以後所發行各債，係在後方發行，債票並未洗入淪陷區，故無因戰事而遭刧失之情事，持票人如已携回收復區，爲便利償付起見，自應准予就地照付。至三十年以飾發行各債債票，多已流入淪陷區，上海各地淪陷後，當地各銀行各持票人多未帶出，而爲敵僞刧失，如因戰事損失，俟查明刧失情形，辦理登記手續，方得恢復償付。由本部彙核各銀行報吿，擬訂處理辦法，不久即可公布。以上辦法爲行政上應有之手續，並非對於戰飾公債不予償付。</p>
<h3>顧維鈞飛抵渝</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶九日電〕駐英大使顧維鈞今下午五時飛抵渝。據稱：此次返國任務，係出席二中全會，及向中樞報吿聯合國大會開會經過，預期將留國內一月。顧大使今晚應宋院長宴，定明出席全會。又中國銀行倫敦分行經理李德亦同機自倫敦返渝。</p>
<h3>永年東明被圍慘象</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕北平來人談，常軍調處認爲停戰工作大致滿意時，被圍二月之河北永年東明兩縣，在衝突區內活活餓死者，巳達一萬餘人。上述兩縣城內，被困之飢民，現已將死馬野狗及老鼠食盡，如再不解圍，不須十日，即將發生慘不忍言之人吃人現象。聞上述兩縣歷年因連遭共匪水旱蝗五災，人口合計已不足八萬人。</p>
<h3>渝金鈔價格</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶九日電〕廠條開盤一五八〇〇〇，最高一五八五〇〇，最低一五七〇〇〇，收盤一五七〇〇〇，鑄條上午開盤一五五〇〇〇，收盤一五四〇〇〇。美鈔上午開盤二一一五，最高二一一三，最低二〇七〇，收盤二〇八〇。</p>
<h3>跨進東北大門</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特派員韓淸濤寄自溝幫子</p>
<p>從上海和香港，經過了浩瀚的南海，東海·黃海·渤海·運到了無數新式裝備的隊伍，一批接着一批的登陸秦皇島，邁着整齊的步伐，威武堂堂，然後就上了火車，一列接着一列的載往東北，人民都感到了光耀和安</p>
<p>記者隨着一部國軍北上，當着到達「天下第一關」的時候，夕陽的紅光，已經渲染了半邊天，萬里長城，雄踞在山巓上，城台座座，如碼堡般，向西北展延過去，較遠的置在了霧氣蒼茫間，態勢雄偉，氣象萬千。</p>
<p>出了山海關，跨進了東北大門，氷塊封起來的河面，已經開始在溶解，枯乾的楊柳枝頭，已經露出了春意，短牆小院裏的老者，依杖含笑的注視着南米的國軍列車，婦女也多暫停了操作，小孩子們，更飛奔到了鐵道近前，看呆了眼睛，車上和車下的人們，多半含着未洗下來的酸心淚水！</p>
<p>十四年前的景物，從新映入了眼簾，模糊的記憶，重新加厚和明朗起來，面前排列着無數爲了經濟與暖和的石灰平房，充作燃料的秫稭垜，儲藏冬季菜蔬的土窖，縱橫大地間壟台和糞堆，馳騁公路上的三套大馬車，趕車小夥子手裏的鞭子，甩出了「刮刮」尖脆的聲響，鞭子上的紅纓，在夕陽裏閃動着光輝。</p>
<p>火車在關東大平原上飛馳着，北寗路山海關到瀋陽間，雙軌的敷設，火車往來是暢通無阻的，沿途看到了數不清被破壞的鐵路新式房屋和鐵路設備，一種刀挖般的劇痛，刺進了心頭，眼前景物隨著夜的來臨而黑暗下來！</p>
<p>一站一站不斷的前進，站台上的「花蓋梨」，「豆腐皮」，「鹹鷄子」的呌賣聲，從暗淡的燈光裏傳出來，夜半過錦州的時候，錦州的燈光，照耀得十分明亮，從大小建築物的輪廓裏，體會出了廣大的錦州市區，錦州在建設方面，的確有很大的進步。</p>
<p>因爲大凌河水塔發生障礙，車頭沒辦法上水，不得不另候機車來拖曳，大凌河吹過來刺痛肌膚的寒風，威脅着南來的國軍，都在喊着：「東北眞冷啊」，但是並沒有半點的畏縮。</p>
<p>天光破曉，另一個車頭來了，這列車於是被拖到了「溝幫子」，溝幫子是屬於北鎭縣的一個集鎭，有一條北寗支綫聯絡着遼寗省南端的兩個觸角，同時也是北寗路中段和「南滿路」的一個聯絡點，營口的海陸客貨運輸，也和這一個聯絡點，發生著密切關係的。</p>
<p>目前國軍的行動，當然又把這裏形成了一個起著樞紐作用的要地，記者爲了要看看當地風光，遂不直指國軍前鋒所在地潘陽西郊的皇姑屯，而在溝幫子停留下來。「溝幫子」的意義，大致的說起來，是河溝邊沿的意思，不必再作考古的介紹了。</p>
<p>講幫子是一個小市鎭，每逢三六九日，都有一個集，附近的人，都趕來買賣，不過貨物很缺乏，以國幣十三元合一元的僞滿鈔票或東北洗通券比值說起來，物價當然相常高，大米一斗三百五十元，高糧米一斗一百卅元，中等白麵一斤十五元，猪肉一斤廿五元，牛肉一斤廿三元，尺五方窗紙一張一元三角，布疋近來少了，原因是交通和秩序都有問題。</p>
<p>講幫子人口，約有兩萬，街頭很冷落，沒有大的商店，小的店舖因爲沒貨，生意也不好，幾家飯館和客店，大部份均作軍人生意，軍人照價付錢，所以頗受歡迎，一般人也對軍人有好感。</p>
<p>記者曾往北鎭縣城作了一次巡禮，縣城距溝帮子五十里，公路和橋樑近一二年失修，多坎坷坍塌，頗令人失望。但當看到城區和鄉邨男女同胞那樣的誠樸和有禮貌，同時又是那樣的親切率直，又不能不使人愉快舒暢。</p>
<p>這是一個約近三萬人口的城市，店舖多準備從整旗鼓，因爲僞滿統治和配給辦法的實施，以及近年來的窮困，所以都是坐吃山空，以待光明，現在已經開始在交通困難裏，設法採辦貨物，以恢復正常商業。</p>
<p>文廟前，是一個露天攤床日用零貨市場，鄕裏來的人，都在這裏購辦必需物品，所以每天都塵集着許多人，一般的物價，和溝帮子差不多，花蓋梨，凍酸梨，是北鎮縣出產的大宗，從溝帮子用火車和大車北運的梨子，數字是相當可觀的。</p>
<p>全縣約有三十萬人口，百分之九十以上，都是農人，靠着農產維持生活。敎育方而，在偽滿時期是限制發展的，一般的兒童，讀過初級小學四年，優級小學二年後，再想入「國民高等」讀書，那是十分的困難的，因爲這個類似我們初中的四年「國民高等敎育，僅有一百五十人的少數學額，同時僅有一處，一般盼望子弟深造的，要出許多賄賂，纔能達到目的，因而文化日漸低落下來，</p>
<p>現任縣長是于錫藩，他說縣府經費極端困難，因爲省府規定稅收科目，僅有五項，不准向地方有任何攤派，同時規定的五項稅目，目前又很難收到，以至於在一切政令推行上，都受到了阻碍。對於敎育，本年全縣暫維持省立男女初中各一校，小學一百廿八校，以便一萬或二萬學生，可以讀書。</p>
<p>這們站在醫巫閭山脚下的地方，是古幽州所在地，同時也是一個古戰場，唐詩上的「啼時驚妾夢，不得到遼西」，就是指着這個地帶。醫巫閭山四百里的區域裏，大小廟宇不下四百處，在北鎮縣境內，就有一百多，春季梨花盛開，風光異常優美，許多人來這裏遊山玩景，將來一切安定時，正可造成一個風景區域。　記者在醫巫閭山下，曾訪問了許多仕紳和長者，歸納起來，他們的談話，都一致在说：「十四年來的希望，夢一般的實現了，國土收復了，日月重光了，十四年沒有看到的國軍，進步太快了。起先，我們或者有點懷疑和陌生，但是看到了他們的行動，立刻知道這是救星到了，叫我們怎能不感動的流下淚來，又怎能不表示衷心的歡迎。」</p>
<p>有兩個白鬍子的老者吿訴記者說：「當着我們第一次看到國軍的時候，我們曾丟掉了手杖，一再用雙手拉着這般可敬愛的武裝弟兄」。　邁進了東北大門的國軍，的確備受這些再入祖國懷抱的人們所歡迎，允其是在日本投降後，他們在盼望國軍來臨的期間，曾遭受兩度的變亂，更增大了愛護國軍的心理。</p>
<h3>宋院長政治報告（續）</h3>
<p>第四，經濟生產能力，因原料缺乏，交通阻滯，並受敵人之破壞等種種關係，以致日趨薄弱。以上所舉的經濟上的病因，旣然多而且複雜，並且抗戰雖然結束，大部份複雜的病原依然存在，物資缺乏如故，糧食且有全世界短細之現象，國庫支出因爲縮軍正在初期，較收入數依然巨額超過，交通非但未恢復，而破壞之區段更多，因原斜缺乏，煤斤生產及運輸均遇到障礙，生產能力亦依然薄弱，所以在治療方面，很明顯的必須從多方面進行，並且需要治本·治標同時進行，方能克制。在道治療期內，如果人民明瞭病的根源，就一定能極度忍耐，也就能得到澈底的後果。</p>
<p>為謀收支平衡　同時裁軍增稅</p>
<p>茲將政府應付的方略，略爲說明。第一，是謀收支平衡，政府支出最大的是軍費，在抗戰期中，我們爲爭取勝利，絕對不能裁减軍隊，因之不惜竭其所有，盡其所能，以求軍費的供應。但在戰爭結束以後，軍費應積極减低，好在我武裝同志，都已完全了解，此次在南京舉行整軍會義，由二百五十三師减爲九十師，國家負擔，可以减輕，但各位同志，仍請注意，縮軍政策，雖然已經決定，但要完全辦到，尙須今後一個時期努力，同時還需要一筆編遣經費，所以减輕國庫負擔，還需要相當時期，方能成就。</p>
<p>同時一切經費，凡於經濟復員不是迫切需要的，也必須在合理範圍內，極力撙節，因爲經濟沒有達到安穩的地步，眞正大規模的政治經濟建設，是絕對不可能的。這是講支出方面，必須嚴格的合理的撙節，而在收入方面，允須極力設法去增加，才能有收支平衡的希望。（未完）</p>

<h3>星期論壇　我國與教廷外交關係之檢討</h3>
<p>— 葉秋原</p>
<p>我國與敎廷梵蒂岡建立外交關係，是抗戰期內我國外交上的一大成就。梵蒂岡豁地不過一〇八·七英畝，爲世界最小的獨立國，其所以在國際關係上視爲重鎭者，則以其地爲羅馬敎宗之所居，而敎宗則爲散布在全世界各處天主敎信衆之精神領袖。教宗及敎廷爲一種超越塵世的制度，它本身不直接參加國際政治；然全世界逾四萬萬的天主信衆，對於敎宗的一言一行，以及敎廷方面的措施，靡不至爲關注，影響所及，良非淺鮮。各國之派遣使節，駐在敎廷，原有種種關係。歐洲及拉丁美洲諸國，有的其全部人口幾盡爲天主敎信衆，各該國政府，內此，需要對敎廷保持密切接觸，故而派遣使節駐在義廷。在教廷則亦以各該國內天主教信衆人數衆多，教國　　，也需要與各該國政府保持密切接觸而派遣使節。此外，自羅馬帝國衰亡以來，歷悠長的中古世以迄近代，羅馬教宗爲歐洲惟一的最高權權威；歐洲國家率多派遣伊朗駐敎廷，以示對於教宗及教廷的崇敬。若干國家，如法蘭西西班牙等，且以駐在敎廷的使節爲其外交官中最隆重的職位。「宗敎改革」的結果，使北歐各國脫離了它們與羅馬教宗的歷史關係，然不久，雖在宗教信仰上，未能回歸羅馬，因國內天主敎信衆的依舊存在，同時，為運用梵蒂岡所處的地位，亦復紛紛派遣使節駐在　廷，如英國荷蘭均派有公使，戰前的德國派有大使駐在教廷。美國鑒於敎廷所處地位的重要，故羅斯福總統曾派有火使銜之泰拉氏爲其特使，駐在教廷。以此種種，故梵蒂岡雖爲彈丸之地，而各國使節雲集。此在近代的國際關係上，實爲一件饒有意義的事。</p>
<p>至於我國與教廷建立外交關係，一直擱到抗戰起後，特別自珍珠港事變起後纔實現的事。珍珠港事變起後，日本即派遣其駐在法國大使館之參事原田健爲首任駐教廷公使，其後又晋　爲大使。其時梵蒂岡各國使節雲集，德義日俱有使節駐在其地，聯合國方面之英美及拉丁美洲諸國亦有使節駐在敎廷。我國爲爭取外交主動，同時爲抵制日木的措施，於民國卅一年二月參政會議席上，通過請政府與敎廷建立外交關係的決議移付政府施行。政府本此決議，與敎廷進行建立外交關係的商談；最初由我駐瑞士代辦謝壽康氏進行，其後談判移至美京，我方由當時之外交部長宋子文氏及胡世澤氏與敎宗駐美代表薛谷尼總主敎進行商談，成立協議，由我國派遣公使，前往敎廷，而敎廷則以原駐在中國之宗座代表賡續執行其任務。同年五月，政府發表以謝壽康氏爲我首任駐敎廷公使；謝氏奉命後，即自瑞士　敎廷特備之專車前往任所。其時我國已與德義宣戰，故謝氏抵任以後，即深居敎廷特備之第宅，不能越出梵蒂岡一步，因一出梵蒂岡聖伯多祿堂前，即爲義大利豁境，我與義旣宣戰，謝氏行動不能自由也。謝氏蟄居梵蒂岡逾二年，面德義崩潰，始於羅馬覓得館址，正式成立我駐教廷公使館。謝氏留歐多年，精通法語，於西歐文學藝術造詣極深，而教廷梵蒂岡又爲西洋藝術及文學聖地，自羅馬時代經文藝復興以迄近代，所有藝術文學上的珍品，威集中於梵蒂岡一地。謝氏以精通西歐文化之人，出任我國首任駐敎廷公使，極爲勝任愉快。因是在敎廷外交團中，謝氏所享聲譽甚高。</p>
<p>自敎宗庇護十二世任命我靑島宗座代牧區宗座代牧田耕莘主敎爲首任國篇樞機以來，若干人士，包括若干天主敎人士在內，以爲教宗對我國教務旣極關切，而中國政府又願與敎廷樹立親睦關係，因此，對於我國與敎廷的外交關係頻加注意；或則主張將我國駐在教廷之使節昇格爲大使，或則主張要求敎廷派遣正式公使或大使來華，以爲我國旣派有公使駐在敎廷，而敎廷迄未派遣公使或大使來華，有往無來，跡近一種不友好的行徑。前者重慶中國天主敎文化協進會爲慶賀田氏升任樞機，推派代表前往羅馬參加樞機敕命典禮，該代表等於抵達羅馬以後，曾有電致南京宗座代牧區宗座代牧于斌主敎，謂教廷正在考慮派遣大使來華，其人選日內即可發表云云。無論敎廷對此問題將取何種措施，我們於此際來就我國與敎廷的外交關係，作一檢討，當不是一件完全無益的事。</p>
<p>查教廷派遣駐外使節計有四種：（一）特使（Legatesa　latere）爲在某種特定塲合代表敎宗之特使；（二）太使（Nuncios）代表敎宗駐在國外政府，處理關於敎廷及駐在國間之事務；（三）公使（Internuncios），較大使職位爲遜之使節，代表敎廷當局推進與駐在國間之關係；（四）宗座代表（Apodtolic　Delegates），代表敎宗監督駐在國之教務。我國之有宗座代表肇端於民國十一年八月，是年八月九日敎宗駐華代表公署正式在北平成立，首任駐華宗座代表爲剛恒毅總主敎；剛氏於民國十一年夏來華，至民國二十二年冬解職，由今宗座代表蔡寗總主敎繼其任以迄於今。在過去二十三年同，宗座駐華代表除監督在華敎會事務外，並以敎宗代表資格，接納故林主席及今蔣主席所加予之優禮；又復以敎宗代表身份與駐華外交團同等參加總理奉安。即如今宗座代表蔡寗主敎，於去歲十月間赴渝，亦曾承蔣主席天婦曁我國外交部長優渥之欵待。我國之派遣公使駐在敎廷，僅是晚近兩三年來的事，而敎廷之派有代表駐在我國，爲時已逾二十三年，故不能謂我國與教廷問之關係，只是單程交通，有往無來。</p>
<p>當前的問題是：我國旣派公使駐在敎廷，何以敎廷不派公使或大使來，而仍由宗座代表賡續執行其任務？據已知的情報，當我國與教廷代表在美京商談派遣使節的時候，曾有這樣一個協議，就是：我國派遣公使駐在敎廷，而敎廷則仍以其原有宗座駐華代表賡續執行其任務。敎廷之所以不曾派有新的使節來，大的就是基於此項協議，將來敎廷是否會派大使或公使來華，此在敎廷自有權衡，我們不必於此妄加臆測。不過這裏有幾點值得我們注意：（一）故羅斯福總統曾派有大使銜之特使駐在敎廷，而敎廷駐美者仍爲宗座代表；（二）英國派有公使駐在敎廷，而敎廷駐英使節亦宗座代表；（三）敎廷大使率多派駐天主敎國家如法，如比，如波蘭，如匈牙利，以及拉丁美洲各國，按照國際慣例，敎廷大使不間其年資，應爲駐在國外交團的領袖，此在天主敎國家，自無問題，若在非天主敎國家，因國際關係的牽制，率有未便；（四）敎廷公使之派遣，在敎廷駐外五十九使節中爲數僅有二，一在立陶宛，一在荷蘭，實是一種不甚重要的職位。</p>
<p>基上各點，可知敎廷對於駐華使節之派遣，不得不加審愼。中國雖有天主敎信衆四百萬，究非天主敎國家，派遣大使，在敎廷縱非絕對不可考慮，但爲駐在國的利益，此舉是否爲明智，要亦不無疑問；况有英美成例可援，則「宗座代表」儘可達成使命，不必有所更張。若云派遣公使，儘可毋須多此一舉，蓋敎廷公使之地位祇能代表敎廷國務卿，並不能代表元首敎宗，其地位反不如「宗座代表」之隆重，可以代表教宗也。觀乎以上種種，我們正不必强自有所主張。此在敎廷，當爲最合理而同時又爲最適宜的措施，何待多言，昔王亮疇先生及我國其它有經騐之外交家曾盛讚敎廷外交之高明，我們可以相信，無論教廷採取什麼措施，必經審慎周詳，其間具有至意。</p>
<p>敎廷派遣來華使節是一件事，我國派遣駐敎廷使節又是一事。敎廷重視我國地位及我國敎務，可見於此次田耕莘主敎之晋升樞機；但我們又將如何表示我們對於敎廷的親睦。以敎廷在國際關係上所處地位的重要，鑒於故羅斯福總統之派有大使銜之特使駐在敎廷，我國似應將駐在敎廷公使昇格爲大使。照國際慣例，公使所代表者爲本國之外交部長，大使所代表者爲元首，可知我國現駐敎廷之公使，不能代表國家元首，而祇能代表外交部長，實不足以示隆重。爲今之計，宜將我駐敎廷公使迅予昇格爲大使，不必須以敎廷派大使來而我始昇格作爲一種交換條件（Ouid　Pro　Ouo），外交主動，其在乎期。</p>

<h3>中行繼續配給　金價依然上漲　美鈔高至二各二</h3>
<p>三，九溫度，最高四五，九度，最低三九，六度。</p>
<p>烚赤昨繼續由平趨俏，晨開一六八萬，開後初極平靜，銀樓稍稍補進，人心急不及待，紛紛吸收，中久即回至一七八萬光景，此時時間已近中行掛牌之際，買戶暫時旁觀，一度在一七五萬以下大事掙扎，平靜殊久，迨同業以一七〇萬之價獲得配給四六八條後，實銷又一度告旺，午前一度漲高至一八〇萬，而後稍有盤低，在一七五萬前後掙扎，結果較前收續升八萬，銀樓飾金十九萬，紋銀一千六，銀元仍在原價徘徊，暗拆銀根初鬆繼緊，先爲一角半，最後二角二分。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔隨金市進退，勢態頗穩，晨開二一五〇元有賣，最低見二一〇元買價，而後漸漸轉穩，美匯掛牌未更時，在二一五〇元左右徘徊，午刻最高二二〇〇元，午後金市無秀色，遂稍挫至二一五〇元左右，結果較前收微升三十元，港票盤旋不定，結果回挫十元，新貨與老貨情形相彷彿，徘徊之餘，卅六年微降元，卅七年平平，港電升至四三五元，羅比電匯亦加高至五二〇元，都屬香港定貨結款。</p>
<h3>多頭大施做手　證券先疲後俏</h3>
<p>公債昨甚穩定，盤旋而已，丙種晨開二一八〇元，不旋踵即拉高至二三一〇元以上，而後多方一度施展做手，先退至二一五〇元，午收二二五〇元，較前收微升五十元，戊種亦以次熱地位，帶好五十元，甲乙丁三項雜牌則未動，華股上塲走入軟檔，永紗曾退至三三〇〇元，美亞二四五〇元以下，景福一五五元左右，後以金市受配給關係而呆滯，游資無路可出，又復逐漸蹄人懷抱，逐步盤好，午刻都呈高峯，永紗達三七五〇元，美亞二八五〇元，景福一七〇元，而後稍告回落，結果較前收永紗美亞各好一百餘元，景福升二元，新光五元，勤興則平，信和好十元，午後喊價又告扳高達一成，但多期貨交割，外股亦漸形活躍，怡紗有大戶出籠，六四〇〇元交易頗多，漲勢稍受打擊，影響其他各股，稍見回落，過程大致穩盤，結果較前收計怡紗跌一〇〇元，怡啤一五〇元，紙業一七〇元，鋼業五十元，亞洲一〇〇元，其餘平庸無特色，業廣因較爲冷落，賣價扳高，不易成交。</p>
<h3>勝利公債　將在滬推銷</h3>
<p>財政部徵募之三十四年同盟勝利公債總額五百萬萬元，自去年七月開始徵募後，未能限於年底結束，因展緩半年至本年六月底止，現此項公債，將撥一部份在本市金融工商界承銷。</p>
<h3>棉紗竟成投機品　證券幫侵入市場　花價亦連帶上漲</h3>
<p>昨日紗市續見高翔，廿支雙馬忽又升至一百十七萬，十六支光明亦迫近百萬大關，綠自證券幫買手侵入紗市塲後，以此兩牌爲皮球工具，證之雙馬棧單價，已超過現貨價，可見此中投機氣息較重矣，其他廿支各牌，亦漲三五萬元，人心雖挺，惜客銷未見暢達，紡建公司昨開售呢蔴嗶嘰棉毛毯等品共廿五種，聞下週一照例開售棉紗云。</p>
<p>昨日紐約棉電，美棉期現貨報小十二至廿三磅音，本埠棉市除紡建與民營紗廠咸存觀望，未有舉動外，花商心思，以紗價有力，互做尚不寂寞，價比上日漲起二三千元。</p>
<h3>馬口鐵已軟化</h3>
<p>自去歲以來，馬口鐵實銷之暢，歷數月不衰，漲風熾烈，向來罕有，無奈盛極必衰，近來交易，已陷於停頓狀態中，蓋製罐廠商納胃漸足，暫停購買，而海外定貨復有將到之說，於是貨價呆滯，日趨軟化。</p>
<h3>米市仍緊　麵粉又漲三四百元</h3>
<p>米市以陰雨，來貨稱少，人心堅挺，昨日公會負責人依然勸告同樣穩定價格，倘天轉晴，來源見多，或可回軟，麵粉績升三四百元，油市續漲二三千元，黃豆再加五六百元，豆餅亦隨之加起二百元，麩皮挺秀之勢，生仁漲千餘元，後形仍看到銷爲轉移也</p>
<h3>瑞典報紙　千餘噸到滬</h3>
<p>本市有名之瑞典紙商維昌洋行，開始營業，茲悉該行通海輪，業已抵滬多日，因港內無碼頭可靠，暫在口外拋待，將於今日進口，停靠招商局一號碼頭，聞該輪由中歡運來大批商品，其中有白報紙一千餘噸，該項瑞典白報紙，為戰後第一批到滬。</p>
<h3>採米貸款二十萬萬　米商須有同額資金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市日來以天時趨寒轉雨，來源不無影響，復以金價又告回漲，致逐日又向高峯挺進，前日北粳又一度叩三萬大關，薄稻二萬八千，昨日警局曾派員在米市塲嚴密監視，故交易即趨閑散，做價與前日行市相仿彿，成交極少，事後記者據豆米業公會常務理事邢志剛氏告稱：米市前途看跌，本市民食可望無虞，糧政處某負責人亦告記者稱：該處特派員楊錫志氏，自飛渝請示本市糧政對策後，可望於今明返滬，屆時購米貸款之計劃，當能切實付諸施行，舉凡米糧之來源，採購，運輸，供售，調節等等，均有週密而完備之計劃，如按步實施，常能推行盡利，又據告「聯總」即將有食米二萬噸，分批運來云。</p>
<p>上海糧政特派員楊錫志氏，前赴渝謁見徐部長，請示二十萬萬元米商貸款事，聞經核定，凡荳米行均可獲得此項貸款，惟須視其原有採購米糧資本之能力而定其貸款之數額，即某米行能有一百萬元之流動金採購米糧，方可向該辦公處貸款一百萬元，此種辦法之規定，目的有二，（一）使米商資金全部採購米糧，（二）防止該項資金流入他　，若此法實行，則全市米商最少可動用四十萬萬元資金，採購米糧一次之總數，可達二十萬石。又悉中，中，交，農四國家銀行，已允許玀出此項貸款，其利率爲三分。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>茶市　紅綠茶花色，邇來實銷轉狹，買戶納胃不暢，且一味企圖抑價，但執貨者以成本浩大，不願輕脫，故供求兩稀，行市依然平定。</p>
<p>木材　昨木材市况，趨勢堅穩，因金價上漲人心振奮，惟天雨綿綿，實銷未佳故交易頗稀。</p>
<p>工業原料　燒碱微升，但少成交，下月交貨聞較市價的低落三四成左右，純碱聞卜內門下星期有派貨惟數址不多市價向上。</p>
<p>日用品　昨初做交易寥寥，後因本街各同業稍有添辦，惟市仍不振，結果肥皂除箭刀外，餘均回小，洋燭平定，火柴美麗牌受人垂靑，市勢稍挺，鳳凰亦站原盤。</p>

<p>電影与戲劇　「萬世師表」演出特刊</p>
<h3>「萬世師表」　演出序言</h3>
<p>— 羅學濂</p>
<p>戲劇為宣傳教育最有力之武器，在八年艱苦抗戰中，演劇運動　　澎湃之發展，最飛躍之進步：於振奮人心，鼓勵民氣，喚起全國人民獻身於抗戰，演劇工作者有不可磨滅之功績。</p>
<p>中電劇團成立於民國二十七年，其初為中央電影攝影場同人之萊餘組織，其後以工作開展，乃成正式團體，隸屬於中央電影摄影場。數年來先後演出「桃李春風」，「大地回春」，「刑」，「正氣歌」，「金玉滿堂」，「山城故事」，「萬世師表」，「小人物狂想曲」等數十劇，成績優劣不敢自詡，然隨抗戰共前進，與觀眾同成長，兢兢業業之心則一日未敢少怠。今者抗戰已勝利結束，建國工作亟待加緊展開，中電同人乃繞道湘鄂兼程來滬，冀有以告　於收復區同胞，並號召全國向建國之大道邁進。「萬世師表」一劇為袁俊先生傑作，在重慶演出為時頗久，以共描寫之深刻，意義之宏大，　承觀眾厚愛，備加讚譽，蔣主席五八華誕，親臨觀劇，亦賜嘉獎，中電此次來滬，用擇為第一演出節目，與滬上人士相見，演員陣容大部仍舊，經重新予以排練，冀能更有所進，請希各界人士不吝賜教，對於劇團今後工作尤希各方　助，不勝榮幸企盼之至。</p>
<h3>時代</h3>
<p>— 鐵梅</p>
<p>「萬世師表」裏寫了三代教師：方義達，方的女婿林桐，林的女婿管聲洪。林桐和管聲洪都有着了解他們並能幫助他們的終身伴侶——方爾媃和林小媃。</p>
<p>扮演這幾個劇中人的演員是岳路（方），耿震（林）.張雁（管），白揚（爾爾）和莎莉（小媃）。</p>
<p>對於他們，這裡我特別想指出的是林桐和方爾媃這兩個人物，在舞臺上表現的，他們都經歷了二十年的辰光，這就是說，作者寫出了他們的年輕時代（五四運動的他們）和老年時代（抗戰後的他們），所以要求演員們扮演了年青人，有得扮演老年人。</p>
<p>在重慶舞臺上，大家都熟知白揚和耿震是慣演年青人的。但是耿震演「石達開」的時候，已不是一個年青的角色，在「金玉滿堂」裏的白揚，演的更是一位四五十歲的母親了。他們把自己表演的範圍擴大了。我想，一個好演員該有這樣的本領。</p>
<p>定型的演技，不是為訓，靠了一套看家本領的演員，自己限制住了自己。現在耿震和白揚的演技如何，還不便遽予判斷，等正式公演了再說；但，這無疑是一條該走的路。</p>
<p>同樣的，張雁在他個人的經歷上，演老年人的機會多，如今則是一位年青力壯的小夥子了。</p>
<p>教育界的堅貞的三代在臺上出現了。我們更盼演員中也同樣的有這樣的世家。這要求着演員在舞臺上能多方面的發展自己（適應多方面的角色）永遠的不離開工作崗位，由二十歲到六七十歲都演戲，年青的可以演老年的，年老的可以演年青的。</p>
<h3>「萬世師表」的故事</h3>
<p>五四運動四一年，北平西郊某大學的老教授方義逵，在家裡開了一個茶會，介紹新聘的講師林桐，却明起了鍍金教授婁國棟施運嘉之流的嫉視，只有方老教授和他的女兒方爾媃是了解他敬重他的，也只有在這一點溫暖裏林桐才安心地接了聘書，工作起來。</p>
<p>過了一年，林桐在學校已經獲得了學生們普遍的敬愛，五四前夜，他領導學生們準備向賣國賊曹章陸遊行示威，方義逵老教授自己生病不能參加，却極力贊助他們，方爾媃也毅然拒絕了那五分鐘熱度的虎頭蛇尾的同學鄭楚雄的求婚，追隨着林桐，投進了大時代的浪潮裏。</p>
<p>五四運動轟轟烈烈地爆發了，可是林桐和同事奉術教師劉福萬等却不幸被捕，關了五十多天還不放出來，方爾媃焦急　念中露出了她對林桐的愛情，這使得方義逵在憂憤病危中稍得安慰、而最後在全國罷工罷市罷課的後援下，林桐等終於釋放出來了、在無數學生的熱烈歡呼中，他拉着爾媃的手說：「爾媃我再也不離開你了。」</p>
<p>光陰如箭，林桐在大學裏教了廿年的書，神聖抗戰爆發後，他又隨着學校搬到了長沙，他的學生鄭楚雄做了文學院長，他自己也有了一個女兒小媃，一個兒子小桐，他的家庭生活是幸福美滿，然而國家是在風雨飄搖中，這種美滿也就受到了破壞，一顆炸彈把他們的家產炸個精光，學校校舍也大部被炸，學校不得不答應了學生的請求，徒步遷到昆明。林桐又領導着學生們走上了崎嶇長途，他是永遠跟學生在一起的。</p>
<p>後在到昆明路上的一個小客棧裏，細雨綿綿，林桐的兒子小桐病倒了，林桐忙着招呼學生們媃住處，飯食，鼓舞學生們的情緒，無暇顧及他，學生管聲洪等想請他多住一天好給小桐治病，也被他拒絕了。忽然，改了行，做了運輸公司的老板的婁國樑，也在這小鎮上不期而遇，是他雖鄉遇故知，但今天的婁教授已純是個酒氣沖天的市儈了，在低黯的屋簷下小桐終於　語着死去了，在無比的悲痛裏，爾媃含着眼淚說：「明天一早還是走！」</p>
<p>時間又過了五年，抗戰進入最艱苦的階段，多少教授如同鄭楚雄似的，都受不住窮苦，改行做生意去了，只有林桐雖然窮得連給爾媃治病買藥的錢、燒開水買炭的錢都沒有、却依然清貧自守，教學不倦，林桐毀家紓難，子死妻病，教了半輩子書，究竟得了些什麼酬報呢？鄭楚雄說：「教書是沒有酬報可言的！」</p>
<p>此有酬報的、這酬報來自廣大的學生們。他的女兒小媃和他的學生，也就是他的新女婿管聲洪，在他的感召下，向他發誓要教一輩子的書。同時，他的無數學生們自動的給他開了個「慶祝林桐教授在校服務二十五週年紀念大會」表示學生們對他的景仰，這無數年青人的熱烈的愛戴。在歡呼聲中，林桐和爾媃含着眼淚收下那面「萬世師表」的錦旗。</p>
<h3>「萬世師表」中電劇團本月十二日起在蘭心上演林桐（耿震飾）方爾媃（白揚飾）</h3>
<h3>萬世師表語錄</h3>
<p>我們不能像草覆虫似地一遇到困難就掉轉頭另尋別路，教育事業，也像任何事業一樣，只有堅決地克服了困難渡過了波折，才能尋出這個事業的意義。</p>
<p>——方義逵</p>
<p>國家大事要遇到學生去過問，這好像的確是件很可慘的事，……但是，到了這步出地，我們政府裏的大人先生們提起過一句質問嗎？這些賣國賊的人有一點點顧忌嗎？我們學生不喊有誰來喊？我們學生不問有誰來問？</p>
<p>——方義逵</p>
<p>你快樂，因為你給；因為你給人知識，給人幸福。</p>
<p>——林桐</p>
<p>多一個發國難財的，國家就多損失一分元氣，多一個死守崗位的，國家就多增一份力量。</p>
<p>——林桐</p>
<p>憑了一時的衝動做一件勇敢的事容易，長久地艱苦地守着一個理想那才是真難。</p>
<p>——林桐</p>
<p>我想不到身為教授的人，負責教育人家子弟的責任的人，也玩政客的把戲！</p>
<p>——林桐</p>
<h3>萬世師表　人物頌</h3>
<p>— 方義逵</p>
<p>你是在祖國大地上播種的人</p>
<p>你是人類的智者，</p>
<p>因為你在給，</p>
<p>所以你快樂；</p>
<p>為襁褓時代的國民</p>
<p>培養了無數智慧的花朵。</p>
<p>林桐</p>
<p>在燕荒的濃林中，</p>
<p>我們的智者，</p>
<p>已發現你將是</p>
<p>參天的嘉樹，</p>
<p>給你以陽光，</p>
<p>給你以愛的滋養。</p>
<p>迎着時代的風暴，</p>
<p>你終於堅強的站起，</p>
<p>像驚濤駭浪中的燈塔。</p>
<p>以你智慧的光輝，</p>
<p>照明了孩子們的路，</p>
<p>光亮了子孫們的記憶。</p>
<p>方爾媃</p>
<p>像一股清澈的流泉，</p>
<p>像晶瑩的花苞上的露珠，</p>
<p>滋養了為人所不見的</p>
<p>智慧的根，</p>
<p>為陽光所喜愛的</p>
<p>豐滿的果實，</p>
<p>像培育萬物的春陽，</p>
<p>你欣慰於那幼嫩的苗芽</p>
<p>一片綠色的生機。</p>
<p>方小媃</p>
<p>正如你母親一樣，</p>
<p>你是智慧的花園裏</p>
<p>一朵芬芳的花。</p>
<p>從風雨的黑夜裏，</p>
<p>去迎接黎明的朝陽。</p>
<p>當陽光照耀的時候，</p>
<p>你將是一雙矯健的騰，</p>
<p>奮飛在祖國的空晴，</p>
<p>銜着那智者的言語，</p>
<p>向着祖國的春天歌頌。</p>
<p>管聲洪</p>
<p>有鋼鐵一樣的堅強，</p>
<p>有獅子一般的雄壯，</p>
<p>翻過了萬水千山，</p>
<p>肩背着祖國的風霜，</p>
<p>從你那洪亮的名字裏，</p>
<p>我們已聽到那未來的時代的</p>
<p>聲音。</p>
<h3>在渝演出批評一斑</h3>
<p>在這一霧季裏先後演出的幾個節目中，我們認為「萬世師表」的確是一齣最完整，最精彩的好戲。當此重慶劇運路向無意或有意地偏近趣味，噱頭作風的今日，能夠看到這樣循軌蹈矩，處處認真賣力的演出，我們不僅覺得難能可貴，同時還得向「中電」的一羣，深表無限崇敬！</p>
<p>——重慶新蜀報　集體批評</p>
<p>「萬世師表」寫了難於討好的題材，而作者居然能處理成雅俗共賞的佳構，在藝術的成就上，我們應該給以高的評價，...該劇更顯示了作者的精力充沛，熱情奔放，在技巧上更運用圓熟。</p>
<p>——時興潮文藝　朗琴先生</p>
<p>「萬世師表」真實地寫出了一個不容易寫得真實的偉大的人格，亦生動地寫出了一個不容易寫得生動的現實的教訓。......由於演員的支配得當，合作的和諧，演出的賣力，也必然由於導演者精密的處理以及簡潔的情緒的刻劃，使這一個「高度的知識階級的戲」，顯得很容易為一般人所接受。——（重慶新民報　克尼先生）</p>
<p>劇作中閃燦着高速的Te-mpo，迴旋自如的節奏，錯綜緊湊的編接，如一條瀝瀝的溪流，穿越岩石林　，發出金石的聲音。——（重慶新民晚報　舒　先生）</p>
<h3>花絮</h3>
<p>「萬世師表」中頭式特多，沈揚是童山濯濯，劉厚生是芳草萋萋，白楊是平分秋色，四虎子鼎足朝天。</p>
<p>「萬世師表」中有兒童演員五名，劇務大呌其苦，惟聞現已覓得男女保姆五人，分頭負責云。</p>
<p>「萬世師表」佈景設計李恩杰，有牙痛毛病。工作緊張過度，毛病突發，臥床三日，號哭痛苦不止，故有「天真」之名。</p>
<p>有人說白楊已成功為演員中的一個千面人，她這一次從一個五四時代荳蔻年華的少女角色演起，一直演到抗戰期間的老太婆，真是所謂「演那一個像那一個。」</p>
<p>耿震也是從年青小伙子演起一直演到抗戰期問的老公公，惟沈揚從老子演起，一直演到他兒子，反而活回去了。</p>
<p>有好事者為「萬世師表」撰一聯，曰；萬世師表耿震，千古懿範白楊。</p>

<h3>Northeast New Situation Undergoing Transformation: Shenyang City Fires Everywhere; Rumors of All Soviet Troops Being Transferred</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th (Urgent)] Chongqing News: The news regarding the withdrawal of a portion of Soviet troops from Shenyang, starting from the 7th, has been confirmed, but the official authorities have not yet received formal notification. According to well-informed sources here: The sudden withdrawal of Soviet troops from Shenyang on the 1st is extremely noteworthy given the Communist forces eyeing Shenyang from the outskirts. Since the authority of military mediation has not yet reached the Northeast, and the Communist forces that have transferred to the Northeast from the Jehol and Chahar provinces have clearly obtained some kind of support, they are awaiting a new opportunity. If so, then the future new situation in the Northeast will be unveiled in a hurried and chaotic manner, which is highly probable. Whether Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai can immediately go to the Northeast will depend on Moscow's attitude. The new situation in the Northeast is gradually transforming.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang Dispatch, 9th (Urgent)] Soviet troops in the Shenyang urban area have been entirely transferred elsewhere, and our troops are currently taking over the defense. There are several fires in the urban area, and Communist forces are very active in the suburbs. Our troops are doing their best to control the city's defenses.</p>
<p>[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 9th] According to estimates from American reporters returning here from Shenyang, the Soviet troops in Shenyang number about six or seven thousand, commanded by Stankevich. There are at least ten thousand Nationalist troops stationed in the west of Shenyang, not far from the city, and another twenty thousand Nationalist troops. Several tens of thousands of Nationalist troops are being blocked at Xinmin and Dahushan. After Japan's surrender, the Communist army once controlled Shenyang. Recent news indicates that tens of thousands of Communist troops are still entrenched seven to ten miles from the city.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 8th] Shenyang Dispatch, 8th (Urgent): Since yesterday, the Soviet troops here have been frequently mobilizing. Tanks, artillery, and other heavy weapons have appeared in groups in the station area. There were also fourteen heavy artillery pieces and more than thirty artillery vehicles, many teams of officers and soldiers, and large amounts of military supplies busy loading onto trains. The station was placed under martial law yesterday afternoon, and the entry and exit of pedestrians were prohibited. This has not been lifted as of this evening. General observations suggest that the Soviet troops appear to be withdrawing, but our official authorities have never received notification. Soviet troops have left the Shenyang suburbs and Tiexi district, and our troops have automatically taken over the defense. According to previous reports, the Soviet side had boasted of holding a large-scale military exercise. Whether this movement is an exercise, a withdrawal, or some other action, no one dares to say for sure. Currently, Communist troops are stationed all around Shenyang. If the Soviet troops are indeed withdrawing, then they may take advantage of the situation and enter, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 8th] After the news of the northward movement of Soviet troops in Shenyang was released, no Soviet train has been seen arriving here as of 9:00 PM this afternoon (Chongqing time). However, the Changchun Station has restricted the entry of general passengers since the 7th, but passenger trains to Shenyang continue to sell tickets as usual. Furthermore, according to information, Soviet troops in Harbin also appear to be moving, with activity occurring in both the north and south, but Changchun remains stable as before.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] A report sent from Changchun for official reference states: There are various signs that the Soviet army is beginning to withdraw or preparing to withdraw. However, this statement has not yet been formally confirmed.</p>
<h3>US Protests to Soviets Again Over Soviet Actions in Northeast; Marshall Summoned Back to US Next Week for Consultation</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington Dispatch, 9th] Secretary of State Byrnes stated yesterday that the US government's second protest to the Soviet government this week regarding Soviet actions in Manchuria cannot currently be announced. The US government sent a note to the Soviet government on February 9, and the reply has just been received, so the third protest has been blocked. He does not yet know if the protest has been sent.</p>
<p>[US Information Service Washington Dispatch, 8th] Secretary of State Byrnes announced at a press conference today that the United States has received the Soviet Union's reply to the US note of February 9 regarding the disposition of Northeast industry. Byrnes clarified that this reply is not in response to the note he sent to the Soviet Union this week, but rather to an earlier message. [Another Dispatch] President Truman stated at a press conference today that he has asked General Marshall, the US President's Special Envoy to China, to return to Washington as soon as possible for consultation. The President said that Marshall will still return to China as a Special Envoy afterwards.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] The various sectors of the capital city expect that Special Envoy Marshall will depart around the 15th of this month after the closing of the Second Plenary Session and return to his country to report on his duties. The main reason President Truman recalled Special Envoy Marshall is to discuss the situation in the Northeast. According to people close to the Three-Man Committee: Committee members Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai are very eager to personally inspect the Northeast, but this is unlikely to happen at the moment.</p>
<p>[United Press this City Dispatch, 9th] United Press correspondent Minter states: At the end of the war, there were 1.6 million Japanese soldiers and civilians in the Northeast. The Soviet Union's lack of cooperation with the American plan to send these Japanese people back to their country has become another new cause of friction between the US and the Soviet Union. Given the importance of this work, US Special Envoy to China General Marshall will likely raise this issue with senior officials in Washington when he returns to the United States next week, as the completion of the repatriation work is extremely related to the American demobilization in the China theater.</p>
<h3>Special Committee of the International Military Tribunal Will Come to China</h3>
<p>To Collect Evidence of Japanese War of Aggression Against China</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo Dispatch, 9th] The Stars and Stripes newspaper quoted US Prosecutor Keenan as saying that a special committee of the International Military Tribunal will depart for China at the end of this week to bring back evidence related to Japan's war of aggression against China and to arrange for witnesses to testify in court. Keenan also said that this committee will discuss with the Chinese government Japan's violation of treaties, undermining of legal obligations, and unauthorized invasion of China, resulting in the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Chinese people. This committee will also investigate the entire event of the Japanese army's fighting in the northeastern provinces of China, as well as the attack on the British and American gunboats on the Yangtze River in 1937. After arriving in Shanghai, this committee will stay for a while to participate in the trial of the Japanese who killed three American aviators, and will assist in the early return of Itagaki, the Japanese army commander responsible for the Nanjing Massacre, to Japan. This committee will include Xiang Zherong, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai High Court.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Will Not Leave China For the Time Being; Declared at a Reception for Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] General Wedemeyer, Commander of the US China Theater, held a reception for reporters at the Construction Building yesterday morning at 11:30, and spoke for one hour and forty-five minutes.</p>
<p>Inconvenient to Express Opinions on the Northeast Problem</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Soviet problem in the Northeast, General Wedemeyer said that this is within the scope of Marshal Marshall's mission, and he is not in a position to express any opinions. He has not heard of the dispatch of a mediation execution team to the Northeast. But he knows for sure that Marshal Marshall is not going, and is scheduled to leave for the United States on the 12th of this month. Whether his mission will be taken over by General Wedemeyer during his absence has not yet been specified. A reporter asked his opinion on reports that the Soviet side does not recognize the passports of American reporters to the Northeast. General Wedemeyer said that he had not heard of it, but he personally treats reporters from any country equally, and hopes that others will also have this attitude. One American reporter stated that he had shown the certificates issued by the US China Theater when he went to Changchun and Shenyang, and they were recognized by the Soviet side, and the process was quite satisfactory. But another American reporter said that the situation was exactly the opposite when he was in Dalian. General Wedemeyer also said that a newspaper reported that Japanese residents widely rumored that the US and the Soviet Union had already started a war, which is an absurd rumor, and modern newspapers must not make such incorrect reports.</p>
<p>Repatriation of Japanese Proceeding Smoothly</p>
<p>The repatriation of Japanese people is currently proceeding very smoothly. The US military headquarters in the China theater has repatriated 642,000 Japanese people. The three locations of Sanmen, Shantou, and Xiamen have now all been repatriated. The Japanese in Taiwan, Hainan Island, Guangdong, and Vietnam can all be repatriated next month. General MacArthur has made thorough preparations to transport the repatriated Japanese to various locations. Currently, China can repatriate an average of about 400,000 people per month. In addition, before February 14, 6,000 Koreans from North China have been repatriated, and 5,100 people from Central China will be repatriated before March 4. There are still 56,000 Korean refugees remaining in China, who are not subject to repatriation and will be decided by the Chinese and Korean authorities themselves. As for Hong Kong, Commander Fitzwilliam is responsible. Regarding the repatriation of Japanese troops in the Northeast, General Wedemeyer has telegraphed the US government to clearly state the scope and authority of his work in China.</p>
<p>Definite Date for Headquarters Closure Undetermined</p>
<p>The US military headquarters in the China theater may be closed in the early summer of this year, but the definite date depends on the work situation. The mission of the US military headquarters is to assist China in repatriating Japanese residents and prisoners of war, and at the same time transport Chinese troops to the Northeast, but if the Communist ceasefire agreement is formally implemented, then troop transport can be stopped. The US military can demobilize after the Japanese have been repatriated to a considerable extent. As for whether every American soldier can return home after the disbandment, General Wedemeyer solemnly replied that Marshal Marshall is the US President's Special Envoy, who came to China to be responsible for assisting China in resolving economic, military, and political matters. In order to assist him in carrying out his work, if we need to continue to stay here, then we should complete the task before returning home.</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer continued to report that some US government officials will come to Shanghai this Wednesday to handle surplus US military supplies.</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer affirmed that news of his return home this month is absolutely unreliable, and he does not plan to go to the Nine Eastern Provinces in the near future.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Shijie</h3>
<p>There is a Saying That He Will Resign Before the Closing of the Session</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] The Kuomintang Gazette reported today that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie intends to resign before the closing of the Second Plenary Session. The Yishibao reported that Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan will go to Canada and the United States after the closing of the Second Plenary Session.</p>
<h3>US Military Advisory Group to China Established with Approval from Both China and the US; Group Headquarters Located in Nanjing, Personnel Arriving in Succession</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency this City Dispatch] General Wedemeyer announced yesterday that the US Military Advisory Group to China has been established with the approval of both China and the US. The group headquarters is in Nanjing, and the internal personnel are as follows:</p>
<p>Group Commander General McClure (Major General, former Commander of the US Operations Headquarters in China), Chief of Staff General Brink (Brigadier General, Staff Officer of the US Theater Command, held important positions in various battlefields during the war), Air Force Training Director General McCaddon (Brigadier General, former Director of the US Air Force in Chongqing, recently returned to China from the US), Army Training Director Colonel McClure (succeeded General Middleton as Commander of the Training Group in China, arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing on the 5th of this month, and went to Nanjing yesterday), Personnel Group Colonel Potter, Intelligence Group Colonel Maxey, Strategy Group Colonel Guthrie, Transportation Group Colonel Calles.</p>
<p>The above personnel are all temporary in nature. The number of people in the group will not exceed 750. The mission is to help China train its troops. It is entirely advisory in nature, and is not employed by China, nor does it assist the Chinese army in combat. Apart from a portion who are members of the US Regular Army, the rest are volunteers. The personnel of the group have been arriving in Nanjing in succession to start work.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency this City Dispatch] General Brink, Chief of Staff of the US Military Advisory Group to China, who is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing on the 15th of this month, told reporters yesterday afternoon that General McClure, the group commander, has been carrying out preparatory work in Nanjing for two weeks.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Reform Plan Expected to be Established; Plenary Session Continues Discussion on Transportation; Many Questions Raised at the Meeting Regarding Management</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Chongqing News: After the opening of the Second Plenary Session, the party and government reform movement advocated by some Central Committee members has gained widespread sympathy. It is heard that the majority of Central Committee members advocate that although the Kuomintang will be an ordinary political party in the future, the revolutionary mission entrusted to the Kuomintang by history, the nation, and the state cannot be shirked. Therefore, in order for the Kuomintang to promote party virtue, enhance party reputation, and enrich the party's revolutionary spirit, it must first restore the spirit of the 1911 Revolution. The party fees paid by party members should be used entirely for party-run cultural undertakings and all social welfare undertakings beneficial to workers, farmers, and ordinary people. Party staff should be purely voluntary in order to create a noble party style of "party members vow to support the party with blood and sweat." It is heard that this proposal was put forward by some young Central Committee members and received enthusiastic support from the majority of old comrades of the party. After a concrete plan is established, it is expected to be passed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] The Second Plenary Session held its eleventh meeting at 9:00 AM today, with 206 Central Committee members in attendance. Chaired by Bai Chongxi, the session continued to discuss transportation issues. Chen Xihou, Dai Kuisheng, Li Zhongxiang, Wang Ruoxi, Zhou Yibin, Pan Gongdian, Miao Peicheng, Wei Yongcheng, and others spoke, raising many questions about transportation management, believing that the recent workers' strikes were caused by poor management. Also, Liu Zhongyang and China Aviation...</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] The Second Plenary Session held its twelfth general meeting this afternoon, with 279 Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members in attendance. Zou Lu chaired the meeting. He Yingqin and 37 other committee members temporarily moved to include Guizhou province in the distribution of post-war relief supplies. The chairman decided to submit the case to the Relief and Rehabilitation Review Committee for joint review. Next was the review of the food report, followed by a local political report by Huang Shaohong. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. Furthermore, all members of the plenary session are scheduled to hold a memorial service for Committee members Li Liejun, Ye Chucang, and Li Menggeng at the Youth Hall in the morning of the 10th, and hold the thirteenth general meeting in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Methods for Handling Pre-War Public Bonds; Minister of Finance Yu Answers Committee Member Pan Gongzhan's Questions</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] After the Third Finance and Financial Report of the Second Plenary Session, Committee Member Pan Gongzhan submitted a written inquiry stating: The Shanghai Securities Speculation Market uses public bonds as speculation targets, deliberately spreading rumors that the government will use Sun Yat-sen banknotes to pay the principal and interest of pre-war public bonds in order to raise prices and profit from it. The Ministry of Finance has never expressed an opinion on this. A month ago, the Ministry of Finance telegraphed Shanghai, stating that all wartime public bonds would be repaid with principal and interest, but that pre-war public bonds would be handled separately. As a result, the rumors became even worse, and speculation and price increases became more intense. What are the Ministry of Finance's plans and methods for this? Please decide and announce them quickly to prevent rumors, etc. The Ministry of Finance Minister Yu responded to this with a written reply on the morning of the 8th. The details are as follows: Upon investigation, the Shanghai Securities Market has been suspended for a long time since the occupation. Recently, both the Shanghai Securities Market and the gold and foreign exchange markets have been black markets with many rumors. The part about Sun Yat-sen banknotes being used to pay the principal and interest of pre-war public bonds is entirely a rumor. I have repeatedly made statements that our Ministry does not recognize the plan to issue Sun Yat-sen currency. As for the inquiry about all wartime public bonds being repaid with principal and interest, and pre-war public bonds being handled separately, the facts are not as such. According to the regulations of our Ministry, all bonds issued since 1941 will continue to be paid with principal and interest as usual in the recovered areas. Bonds issued before 1941 will be handled separately because bonds issued after 1941 were issued in the rear area, and the bond certificates did not flow into the occupied areas, so there was no loss due to the war. If the bondholders have taken them back to the recovered areas, they should be allowed to pay locally for the convenience of repayment. As for the bond certificates issued before 1941, most of them have flowed into the occupied areas. After the occupation of Shanghai and other places, most of the local banks and bondholders did not take them out, and were lost by the enemy and puppets. If there are losses due to the war, they must be investigated and registered before repayment can be restored. Our Ministry will compile and review the reports from various banks, and formulate handling methods, which will be announced soon. The above methods are administrative procedures that should be in place, and are not a denial of repayment for wartime public bonds.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Flies to Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] Ambassador to the UK Gu Weijun flew to Chongqing at 5:00 PM today. It is said that the purpose of his return to the country is to attend the Second Plenary Session and report to the central government on the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly, and he is expected to stay in the country for a month. Ambassador Gu will be hosted by Premier Song tonight, and is scheduled to attend the plenary session. Also, Li De, the manager of the London branch of the Bank of China, returned to Chongqing from London on the same flight.</p>
<h3>Tragic Scenes of Yongnian and Dongming Being Besieged</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] People from Beiping say that while the Changchun Military Mediation Office believes that the ceasefire work is generally satisfactory, in the two counties of Yongnian and Dongming in Hebei, which have been besieged for two months, more than 10,000 people have starved to death within the conflict zone. In the above-mentioned two counties, the trapped starving people have now eaten all the dead horses, wild dogs, and rats. If the siege is not lifted within ten days, there will be unspeakable scenes of cannibalism. It is heard that the population of the above-mentioned two counties is less than 80,000 in total due to the five disasters of Communist bandits, floods, droughts, and locusts over the years.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Gold and US Dollar Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 9th] Factory gold bar opened at 158,000, highest 158,500, lowest 157,000, closed at 157,000. Cast gold bar opened at 155,000 in the morning, closed at 154,000. US dollar opened at 2115 in the morning, highest 2113, lowest 2070, closed at 2080.</p>
<h3>Entering the Northeast Gate</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Han Qingtao from Goubangzi Reports</p>
<p>From Shanghai and Hong Kong, after traversing the vast South China Sea, East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea, teams equipped with countless new-style equipment, batch after batch, landed at Qinhuangdao. With orderly steps and imposing presence, they then boarded trains, one after another, heading towards the Northeast. The people felt a sense of glory and peace.</p>
<p>Following a National Army unit heading north, as a reporter, when we arrived at "The First Pass Under Heaven," the red glow of the setting sun had already dyed half the sky. The Great Wall, majestic, stood atop the mountain peaks, its watchtowers like fortresses, stretching towards the northwest, the distant ones shrouded in misty haze, their posture magnificent, their aura boundless.</p>
<p>Leaving Shanhaiguan, we stepped through the Northeast's gate. The ice-covered river surface had already begun to melt. The bare willow branches had already revealed signs of spring. In small courtyards with low walls, the elderly leaned on their canes, smiling and watching the National Army trains from the south. Many women also temporarily stopped their work, and the children, even more so, ran to the railway tracks, their eyes wide with wonder. Many of the people on and off the trains had tears of sorrow that had not yet been washed away!</p>
<p>The scenes from fourteen years ago re-entered my sight. Vague memories became thicker and clearer again. Before me were countless rows of gray flat-roofed houses built with limestone for the sake of economy and warmth, stacks of sorghum stalks used as fuel, earthen cellars for storing winter vegetables, the ridges and manure piles stretching across the land, the large horse-drawn carts galloping on the highways, and the whip in the hands of the young drivers, cracking out with a sharp, crisp sound, the red tassels on the whips flashing in the light of the setting sun.</p>
<p>The train sped across the vast Guandong Plain. On the Beining Railway between Shanhaiguan and Shenyang, the laying of double tracks allowed trains to travel back and forth without obstruction. Along the way, I saw countless destroyed railway new-style houses and railway equipment. A knife-like, sharp pain pierced my heart. The scenery before my eyes darkened with the coming of night!</p>
<p>Station after station, we continued to move forward. The cries of "Huagai pears," "tofu skin," and "salted chicken eggs" from the platforms drifted out from the dim light. As we passed Jinzhou in the middle of the night, the lights of Jinzhou shone very brightly. From the outlines of buildings of all sizes, I could sense the vastness of the Jinzhou urban area. In terms of construction, Jinzhou had indeed made great progress.</p>
<p>Because the water tower at the Daling River had a malfunction, the train engine could not take on water and had to wait for another locomotive to tow it. The cold wind blowing from the Daling River, stinging the skin, threatened the National Army coming from the south, who were all shouting, "The Northeast is really cold!" But there was not the slightest bit of timidity.</p>
<p>As dawn broke, another locomotive arrived, and the train was towed to "Goubangzi." Goubangzi is a market town belonging to Beizhen County, with a Beining branch line connecting the two tentacles of the southern end of Liaoning Province. It is also a connecting point between the middle section of the Beining Railway and the "South Manchuria Railway." The sea and land passenger and freight transportation of Yingkou also has a close relationship with this connecting point.</p>
<p>Currently, the National Army's actions have naturally turned this place into a crucial hub. In order to see the local scenery, I, as a reporter, did not go directly to Huanggu屯, the western suburb of Shenyang where the National Army's vanguard was located, but stayed in Goubangzi. The meaning of "Goubangzi" roughly translates to "along the river ditch," so there is no need for any further archaeological introduction.</p>
<p>Goubangzi is a small market town. There is a fair every third, sixth, and ninth day of the lunar month. People from the surrounding areas come to buy and sell, but goods are very scarce. Based on the exchange rate of thirteen national currency yuan to one puppet Manchurian yuan or Northeast circulation券, prices are of course quite high. One dou of rice costs 350 yuan, one dou of sorghum rice costs 130 yuan, one jin of medium-quality white flour costs 15 yuan, one jin of pork costs 25 yuan, one jin of beef costs 23 yuan, and one sheet of 1.5-foot square window paper costs 1.3 yuan. Cloth has become scarce recently because of transportation and order problems.</p>
<p>Goubangzi has a population of about 20,000. The streets are deserted. There are no large stores, and the small shops don't have much business because they lack goods. Most of the restaurants and hotels cater to military personnel. The military pays the set price, so they are quite popular, and the general population also has a good impression of the military.</p>
<p>I, as a reporter, made a pilgrimage to Beizhen County seat. The county seat is 50 li from Goubangzi. The roads and bridges have been in disrepair for the past year or two, with many bumps and collapses, which is quite disappointing. But when I saw the sincerity and politeness of the men and women in the urban and rural areas, as well as their warmth and straightforwardness, I couldn't help but feel happy and at ease.</p>
<p>This is a city with a population of nearly 30,000. Many of the shops are preparing to regroup because the puppet Manchurian rule, the implementation of rationing methods, and the poverty of recent years have meant they have been living off their savings, waiting for the light. Now they are starting to find ways to procure goods despite the difficulties in transportation in order to restore normal business.</p>
<p>In front of the Confucian Temple is an open-air market for daily necessities and sundries. People from the countryside come here to buy essential items, so many people gather here every day. The general prices are about the same as in Goubangzi. Huagai pears and frozen sour pears are the main products of Beizhen County. The number of pears transported north from Goubangzi by train and large carts is considerable.</p>
<p>The entire county has a population of about 300,000, more than 90% of whom are farmers who rely on agricultural products to sustain their lives. In terms of education, development was restricted during the puppet Manchurian period. In general, children who had completed four years of junior primary school and two years of senior primary school found it very difficult to enter "National Higher" school because this four-year "National Higher education," which is similar to our junior high school, had only a small quota of 150 students and only one location. Those who hoped to provide their children with advanced studies had to pay many bribes to achieve their goal, which resulted in a gradual decline in culture.</p>
<p>The current county magistrate is Yu Xifan. He said that the county government's finances are extremely difficult because the provincial government only allows five tax categories and does not allow any apportionment to local areas. At the same time, it is very difficult to collect the five specified tax items, which has hindered the implementation of all government orders. Regarding education, this year the entire county will temporarily maintain one provincial-level coeducational junior high school and 128 primary schools, so that 10,000 to 20,000 students can attend school.</p>
<p>This place, standing at the foot of Yiwulü Mountain, is the site of ancient Youzhou and also an ancient battlefield. The Tang poem "The cry startles the concubine's dream, unable to reach Liaoxi" refers to this area. Within the 400-li area of Yiwulü Mountain, there are no fewer than 400 temples of various sizes. Within the territory of Beizhen County alone, there are more than 100. In the spring, when pear blossoms are in full bloom, the scenery is exceptionally beautiful. Many people come here to hike and see the sights. When everything is settled in the future, it can be made into a scenic area. I, as a reporter, interviewed many gentlemen and elders at the foot of Yiwulü Mountain. To sum up, their conversations all said in unison: "The hopes of the past fourteen years have been realized like a dream. The homeland has been recovered, and the sun and moon shine again. The National Army, which we haven't seen for fourteen years, has advanced too quickly. At first, we may have been a little suspicious and unfamiliar, but when we saw their actions, we immediately knew that the saviors had arrived. How could we not be moved to tears, and how could we not express our heartfelt welcome?"</p>
<p>Two white-bearded elders told me, the reporter, "When we first saw the National Army, we dropped our canes and repeatedly grabbed the hands of these respectable and lovable armed brothers." The National Army, which stepped through the gate of the Northeast, is indeed welcomed by these people who have returned to the embrace of the motherland, especially after Japan's surrender, they have suffered two disturbances while waiting for the arrival of the National Army, which has further increased their love and protection of the National Army.</p>
<h3>President Song's Political Report (Continued)</h3>
<p>Fourth, due to various factors such as the lack of raw materials, obstructed transportation, and enemy sabotage, economic production capacity has become increasingly weak. Since the economic causes mentioned above are numerous and complex, and although the war of resistance has ended, most of the complex pathogens still exist, the shortage of materials remains the same, and there is a global shortage of food. Government expenditures still greatly exceed income because the reduction of the army is in its initial stages. Transportation has not only not recovered, but more sections have been destroyed. Due to the lack of raw materials, coal production and transportation have encountered obstacles, and production capacity is still weak. Therefore, in terms of treatment, it is obvious that it must be carried out from multiple aspects, and both treating the root cause and addressing the symptoms are necessary to overcome it. During the treatment period, if the people understand the root of the disease, they will surely be able to endure it to the extreme, and they will be able to obtain thorough results.</p>
<p>Aiming to Balance Income and Expenditure, While Reducing Military Strength and Increasing Taxes</p>
<p>I will briefly explain the government's response strategy. First, it is to seek a balance between income and expenditure. The largest government expenditure is military spending. During the war of resistance, in order to win victory, we absolutely could not reduce the army. Therefore, we spared no effort to supply military expenses. But after the end of the war, military spending should be actively reduced. Fortunately, our armed comrades have fully understood this. This time, at the military reorganization conference held in Nanjing, the number of divisions was reduced from 253 to 90, which can reduce the national burden. But please note, comrades, that although the downsizing policy has been decided, it will still take effort in the future to fully implement it. At the same time, a sum of demobilization funds is needed, so it will take a considerable period of time to reduce the burden on the national treasury.</p>
<p>At the same time, all expenses that are not urgently needed for economic recovery must also be economized as much as possible within a reasonable scope, because without economic stability, large-scale political and economic construction is absolutely impossible. This is about strict and reasonable economizing on the expenditure side, and on the revenue side, we must try our best to increase it in order to have the hope of balancing income and expenditure.

<h3>French Ships in North Vietnam Violate Agreement; We Demand Compensation for Losses</h3>
<p>Both Sides Agreed to Start Troop Transfers on the 16th and Form a Committee to Go to Haiphong to Investigate</p>
<p>[Reuters Chongqing 9th] The Headquarters of the Chinese First Army in Hanoi issued a statement regarding the French ships carrying troops to Haiphong, intending to land there, which caused a conflict, and demanded compensation for the losses suffered after the bombardment. It stated: On March 5, five French ships entered Haiphong port, and the French troops on board attempted to land. The Chinese garrison, not having received orders regarding this matter, did not allow the French troops to land. The French ships then bombarded the garrison, constituting a violation of the treaty. The Chinese garrison then returned fire, after which an agreement was reached allowing French troops to land on the 7th. Both sides have now agreed to start troop transfers on March 16. It further stated: The Chinese troops suffered losses during the French bombardment.</p>
<p>[United Press Saigon 8th] It is reported here today that French troops have landed in northern Vietnam, and no further incidents have occurred. Today, they entered the Tokyo occupation zone. According to the French command, both Tokyo and Hanoi are quite calm. The commander of the Chinese troops in Vietnam, Lu Han, has agreed with the French on how to continue the French troop landings and has ordered the Chinese troops on the front lines not to open fire without authorization. According to reliable sources, Chinese and French representatives have departed for Haiphong to investigate, and an agreement has been reached to form a joint committee composed of representatives from China, France, and the Annam Independent Government to order their respective troops to cease conflict in all war zones.</p>
<h3>New York Newspaper Reports: Soviet Union Demands Territory from Turkey; Byrnes Unable to Confirm</h3>
<p>[Reuters New York 9th] The New York Times carried a dispatch from Washington, quoting an authority yesterday, that the Soviet Union has demanded that Turkey cede the Kars and Ardahan districts in northeastern Turkey to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has also informed the United States and Britain of this intention. It is reported that the first formal request was delivered to the Turkish ambassador to the Soviet Union in June of last year and was later brought up for discussion at the Potsdam Tripartite Conference. At that time, the British side questioned Molotov: What is the Soviet Union's policy towards Turkey? Molotov replied: Turkey requested to sign an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union a few weeks ago, but the Soviet Union cannot sign such a treaty until the Kars and Ardahan districts are "returned." According to the above, the above two lands were ceded to Turkey by the Soviet Union in a separate peace with Turkey during the First World War.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 9th] Secretary of State Byrnes stated yesterday that the Soviet Union informed Turkey that if the two governments intend to sign any alliance treaty, it should be conditional on first discussing the issue of the Turkish provinces of Kars and Ardahan and the Dardanelles Strait. Byrnes was unable to confirm the claim that the Soviet Union had demanded that Turkey cede the two provinces.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Egyptian Treaty Negotiations to Begin at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] London 9th broadcast: Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky today instructed the Egyptian ambassador to the UK to inform the British government, stating that Egypt is willing to negotiate with the British to revise the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The Egyptian ambassador to the UK will leave Cairo today to go to London. This negotiation can begin at the end of this month. The current situation in Egypt has eased, and student demonstrations have come to an end. According to observers, the results of this negotiation will determine the future power of Britain in the Middle East.</p>
<p>[Reuters Cairo 9th] The police here, under government orders, searched two Kuomintang newspaper offices this morning. The newspapers that one of them had printed were all confiscated, and the other one was allowed to publish as usual after deleting certain text.</p>
<h3>American Writer Angell Advocates for a Western Bloc</h3>
<p>[United Press New York 8th] Writer Angell, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1933, wrote in this month's Mercury magazine: We should organize a Western democratic bloc to supplement the United Nations organization. We should try to make the United Nations organization effective, but at the same time, we must recognize that the United Nations organization is not a perfect organization. As it is only a preliminary model for cooperation between countries, it is not sufficient to guarantee that countries will cooperate. He also said: In today's world, countries have no defense other than cooperation. History has given us another opportunity to organize a Western bloc.

<h3>Gliding Bomb Can Track Enemy Ships with Radar; Used by the US at the End of the War</h3>
<p>[United Press New York 9th] The Bell Telephone Company's laboratory announced today that at the end of the Pacific War, the US Navy used a secret new weapon called "Bat." It is a gliding bomb, 12 feet long and 10 feet wide with its wings. The front end is equipped with radar, and the bomb weighs about half a ton. It is carried by a mother plane to the air and dropped. It can automatically search for enemy warships and merchant ships from several miles away by reflecting radar waves. If the enemy ship evades, the "Bat" can follow relentlessly and will eventually hit its target. The "Bat" emits sound waves during flight, using the sound wave response to guide the flight, hence the gliding bomb is named "Bat." The US Navy began using the "Bat" in combat last year, severely striking Japanese ships and achieving great success.</p>

<h3>Weekly Forum A Review of China's Diplomatic Relations with the Holy See</h3>
<p>— Ye Qiuyuan</p>
<p>The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Vatican during the War of Resistance was a major achievement in China's diplomacy. The Vatican, with an area of only 108.7 acres, is the smallest independent country in the world. Its importance in international relations lies in the fact that it is the residence of the Roman Pope, who is the spiritual leader of Catholics scattered all over the world. The Pope and the Holy See are an institution that transcends the mundane world. It does not directly participate in international politics; however, the more than 400 million Catholics around the world pay close attention to the Pope's words and deeds, as well as the measures taken by the Holy See, and the impact is far from insignificant. The dispatch of envoys by various countries to the Holy See has various reasons. Some European and Latin American countries have almost their entire populations as Catholics, so their governments need to maintain close contact with the Holy See, and therefore send envoys to the Holy See. The Holy See also needs to maintain close contact with the governments of these countries due to the large number of Catholics in these countries, and therefore sends envoys. In addition, since the decline of the Roman Empire, throughout the long Middle Ages and into modern times, the Roman Pope was the sole supreme authority in Europe; most European countries sent envoys to the Holy See to show respect for the Pope and the Holy See. Some countries, such as France and Spain, even considered the envoys stationed at the Holy See to be the most important positions for their diplomats. The result of the "Religious Reformation" was that the Nordic countries broke away from their historical relationship with the Roman Pope, but soon, although they failed to return to Rome in terms of religious belief, because Catholics still existed in the country, and at the same time, in order to utilize the position of the Vatican, they also sent envoys to the Holy See one after another. For example, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands both sent ministers, and pre-war Germany sent an ambassador to the Holy See. The United States, in view of the importance of the position of the Holy See, President Roosevelt sent Myron C. Taylor with the rank of ambassador as his special envoy to the Holy See. For these reasons, although the Vatican is a small place, envoys from various countries gather there. This is indeed a meaningful event in modern international relations.</p>
<p>As for the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Holy See, it was put on hold until after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, especially after the attack on Pearl Harbor. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan sent Ken Harada, a counselor at its embassy in France, as its first minister to the Holy See, and later promoted him to ambassador. At that time, envoys from various countries gathered in the Vatican, and Germany, Italy, and Japan all had envoys stationed there. The United Kingdom, the United States, and Latin American countries on the United Nations side also had envoys stationed at the Holy See. In order to seize the diplomatic initiative and at the same time counter Japan's measures, the National Political Council passed a resolution in February of the 31st year of the Republic of China, requesting the government to establish diplomatic relations with the Holy See and transferred it to the government for implementation. Based on this resolution, the government conducted negotiations with the Holy See to establish diplomatic relations. Initially, Xie Shoukang, our chargé d'affaires in Switzerland, conducted the negotiations. Later, the negotiations moved to Washington, D.C., where our side was represented by Song Ziwen, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Hu Shize, who conducted negotiations with Archbishop Cicognani, the Papal Delegate to the United States, and reached an agreement. Our country would send a minister to the Holy See, and the Holy See would continue to carry out its mission with the original Papal Delegate to China. In May of the same year, the government announced that Xie Shoukang would be our first minister to the Holy See; after receiving the order, Xie immediately traveled from Switzerland to his post in a special car prepared by the Holy See. At that time, China had already declared war on Germany and Italy, so after Xie took office, he lived in a residence specially prepared by the Holy See and could not step out of the Vatican, because once he left the Vatican in front of St. Peter's Basilica, he would be in Italian territory. Since we had declared war on Italy, Xie's actions were not free. Xie lived in seclusion in the Vatican for more than two years, until Germany and Italy collapsed. Only then did he find a site in Rome and formally establish our legation to the Holy See. Xie had lived in Europe for many years, was fluent in French, and had a deep understanding of Western European literature and art. The Holy See and the Vatican are the holy land of Western art and literature. From the Roman era to the Renaissance and into modern times, all artistic and literary treasures are concentrated in the Vatican. Xie, who was well-versed in Western European culture, was extremely competent and happy to serve as our country's first minister to the Holy See. As a result, Xie enjoyed a high reputation in the diplomatic corps of the Holy See.</p>
<p>Since Pope Pius XII appointed Bishop Thomas Tien Ken-sin, Vicar Apostolic of the Qingdao Vicariate Apostolic, as the first cardinal of our country, some people, including some Catholics, believe that the Pope is extremely concerned about our country's religious affairs, and the Chinese government is willing to establish friendly relations with the Holy See. Therefore, they have paid close attention to our country's diplomatic relations with the Holy See; some advocate upgrading our country's envoy stationed at the Holy See to an ambassador, while others advocate requiring the Holy See to send a formal minister or ambassador to China, believing that since our country has sent a minister to the Holy See, and the Holy See has not yet sent a minister or ambassador to China, it is a one-way street and close to an unfriendly act. The former Chongqing China Catholic Cultural Promotion Association sent representatives to Rome to participate in the Cardinal Consistory Ceremony to celebrate Tien's elevation to Cardinal. After arriving in Rome, the representatives telegraphed Bishop Yu Bin, the Papal Delegate of the Nanjing Vicariate Apostolic, saying that the Holy See was considering sending an ambassador to China, and the person to be selected would be announced soon. Regardless of what measures the Holy See will take on this issue, it would not be entirely useless for us to review our country's diplomatic relations with the Holy See at this time.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, the Holy See has four types of envoys stationed abroad: (1) Legates a latere are special envoys who represent the Pope on certain specific occasions; (2) Nuncios represent the Pope to foreign governments and handle affairs between the Holy See and the host country; (3) Internuncios are envoys with lower positions than ambassadors, representing the Holy See to promote relations with the host country; (4) Apostolic Delegates represent the Pope to oversee religious affairs in the host country. Our country's Apostolic Delegate began in August of the 11th year of the Republic of China. On August 9th of that year, the Papal Delegation to China was officially established in Peiping. The first Papal Delegate to China was Archbishop Celso Costantini; Costantini came to China in the summer of the 11th year of the Republic of China and was relieved of his position in the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and the current Papal Delegate Archbishop Antonio Riberi succeeded him until now. In the past 23 years, in addition to supervising the affairs of the Church in China, the Papal Delegate to China has accepted the preferential treatment given by the late Chairman Lin and the current Chairman Chiang in his capacity as Pope's representative; he has also participated in the funeral of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen with the same status as the diplomatic corps in China as the Pope's representative. Even the current Papal Delegate Archbishop Riberi, who went to Chongqing in October of last year, was also treated generously by Chairman Chiang and the women of the nation, as well as our Minister of Foreign Affairs. Our country's dispatch of a minister to the Holy See is only a matter of the past two or three years, while the Holy See's dispatch of a representative to our country has been more than 23 years, so it cannot be said that the relationship between our country and the Holy See is just a one-way street, with only coming and no going.</p>
<p>The current question is: Since our country has sent a minister to the Holy See, why doesn't the Holy See send a minister or ambassador, but still continues to carry out its mission with the Papal Delegate? According to known information, when representatives from our country and the Holy See were negotiating the dispatch of envoys in Washington, D.C., there was such an agreement that our country would send a minister to the Holy See, while the Holy See would continue to carry out its mission with its original Papal Delegate to China. The reason why the Holy See has not sent a new envoy is largely based on this agreement. Whether the Holy See will send an ambassador or minister to China in the future is up to the Holy See to weigh, and we need not speculate on it here. However, there are several points worth noting here: (1) The late President Roosevelt sent a special envoy with the rank of ambassador to the Holy See, while the Holy See's representative to the United States was still the Papal Delegate; (2) The United Kingdom sent a minister to the Holy See, while the Holy See's envoy to the United Kingdom was also the Papal Delegate; (3) The Holy See's ambassadors are mostly stationed in Catholic countries such as France, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, and various Latin American countries. According to international practice, the Holy See's ambassador, regardless of seniority, should be the leader of the diplomatic corps in the host country. This is not a problem in Catholic countries, but in non-Catholic countries, due to the constraints of international relations, it is often inconvenient; (4) The dispatch of the Holy See's ministers is only two out of the Holy See's 59 envoys abroad, one in Lithuania and one in the Netherlands, which is actually a less important position.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, it can be seen that the Holy See has to be cautious about the dispatch of envoys to China. Although China has 4 million Catholics, it is not a Catholic country after all. The dispatch of an ambassador, even if it is not absolutely unthinkable for the Holy See, it is doubtful whether this move is wise for the benefit of the host country; moreover, since there are examples to follow in the United Kingdom and the United States, the "Papal Delegate" can accomplish the mission, and there is no need to change it. If it is said that a minister can be dispatched, there is no need to do so, because the position of the Holy See's minister can only represent the Holy See's Secretary of State and cannot represent the head of state, the Pope. Its position is not as important as the "Papal Delegate," who can represent the Pope. Considering the above, we really don't need to have our own strong opinions. This is the most reasonable and most appropriate measure for the Holy See. Why wait for more words? Mr. Wang Liangchou and other experienced diplomats in our country have praised the Holy See's diplomacy as being highly sophisticated. We can believe that whatever measures the Holy See takes, it will be carefully considered and well-planned, and there will be a great purpose behind it.</p>
<p>The Holy See's dispatch of an envoy to China is one thing, and our country's dispatch of an envoy to the Holy See is another. The Holy See's emphasis on China's position and China's religious affairs can be seen in the recent promotion of Bishop Thomas Tien Ken-sin to cardinal; but how will we show our friendship towards the Holy See? Considering the importance of the Holy See's position in international relations, and in view of the fact that the late President Roosevelt sent a special envoy with the rank of ambassador to the Holy See, our country should upgrade our minister stationed at the Holy See to an ambassador. According to international practice, the minister represents the foreign minister of his country, while the ambassador represents the head of state. It can be seen that our current minister stationed at the Holy See cannot represent the head of state, but can only represent the foreign minister, which is not enough to show solemnity. For the sake of today, our minister to the Holy See should be quickly upgraded to an ambassador. There is no need to make the Holy See's dispatch of an ambassador as a quid pro quo (Quid Pro Quo). The diplomatic initiative lies in the term.</p>

<h3>100,000 Smokers Should Turn Back Sooner Rather Than Later - Total Registered is Still Less Than 1,000 Since Registration Began - Deadline for Signing Self-Reform is Approaching</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] According to news from the Municipal Police Bureau: Since the implementation of the measures to eliminate opium addiction in this city, it has been stipulated that smokers must register with their respective police stations before the end of March of this year and sign a pledge to reform themselves; and they must completely quit opium before the end of June of this year. As of the current investigation, the total number registered is still less than 1,000, while it is estimated that there are more than 100,000 smokers in the city. This shows that most smokers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and some mistakenly believe that there is no difference between registering before or after the deadline. In fact, once the deadline for registration at the end of March has passed, those who apply for self-reform again, or those who are found to have not registered, will still be punished according to the law. Smokers should pay special attention to this point. Furthermore, in order to take into account the cost and location of opium addiction treatment for smokers, the Municipal Health Bureau is currently submitting a request to the Municipal Government to approve measures for free opium addiction treatment in public and private hospitals in Shanghai, so that smokers who are unable to afford it can also find ways to quit opium.</p>
<h3>Authorities Confer and Discuss - To Save the Industrial and Commercial Crisis</h3>
<p>Recently, prices of goods have been soaring in this city, and workers in various industries are often forced to demand salary adjustments due to livelihood problems, resulting in work slowdowns and strikes. In view of this, the municipal authorities convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon, organized by Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, with representatives from industrial trade unions across the city, as well as representatives from the Social Affairs and Economic Affairs departments stationed in Shanghai. After two hours of discussion, two important matters were decided: (1) Actively restore the resumption of work in existing factories to meet the goal of increasing production and suppressing prices, and to rescue unemployed workers. (2) For the repatriation of unemployed workers, priority should be given to technical personnel returning to Shanghai from the southwest hinterland, generally in a ratio of six to four with local workers.</p>
<h3>Water Level Slightly Rising in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River - Two Steamers Will Sail to Hankou and Yichang the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Since last winter, the water level in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River has declined sharply, making navigation extremely difficult. The water levels in the Shanghai-Hankou and Yichang-Chongqing sections are even more depleted. According to news at the beginning of the month, repatriation transportation in the Chongqing-Yichang section is about to be suspended. According to the shipping industry, the water level has risen slightly recently in the Xunyang-Hankou section of the Shanghai-Hankou line. It is now entering the spring flood season, and it is unlikely to decrease significantly afterward. As for the Yangtze River steamers on the Shanghai-Hankou line, no formal transport ships have sailed upstream for three weeks. Transportation relies solely on various small steamers, iron barges, and motorized sailing ships. It is now learned that the Jianghua and Jiang'an steamers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have successively arrived in Shanghai. The Jiang'an is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Hankou next Tuesday. The Minzu steamer of the Minsheng Company is also scheduled to sail directly to Yichang on the same day.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Association Established - Foreign Merchants Unanimously Participate</h3>
<p>The Cigarette Factory Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday, attended by more than sixty manufacturers, including Nanyang, Huacheng, and Fuxin. Geng Xin and others representing Huacheng served as the presidium. The association charter was passed, and important proposals such as tax rates were discussed. What distinguishes this association from the pre-war era is that foreign-owned cigarette factories such as Yizhong and Citibank participated as members this time, so it is hoped that tax issues can be handled uniformly in the future. Finally, Pan Bonian, Dai Gengxin, Ding Panquan, and others were elected as directors and supervisors.</p>
<h3>False Adjutant Cheng Zhaohai - Repeatedly Extorted and Blackmailed - First Trial at the High Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Cheng Zhaohai, a Shanghai native, served as a lieutenant adjutant in the 26th Brigade of the Thirteenth-First Division of the puppet army in July of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), and later rose to the rank of captain of the special service team. He participated in extortion on several occasions. In September of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he served as an inspector of the puppet police station. In the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), he collected 200,000 puppet currency from local villagers in Minhang under the pretext of repairing bridges. After the victory, he was reported and arrested by the Shanghai County Government and transferred to the Shanghai High Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution according to the law. Cai Jin, a judge of the High Court, held a court hearing yesterday morning to interrogate the defendant. The defendant admitted to serving in a puppet position, but denied having kidnapped, extorted, or defrauded anyone. The court ordered that he be remanded for another hearing at a later date.</p>
<p>On the same day, Wang Yongqing, the leader of the special service team in the puppet Fahua Town, and Hui Youyuan, who manufactured military supplies for the enemy, were also tried. After investigation and questioning, they were all ordered to be remanded for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Tea Industry Appeals to the Government - Urging the Determination of Tea Loan Measures</h3>
<p>Important for Relieving Tea Farmers and Foreign Trade Relations</p>
<p>Representatives from four organizations, namely the Shanghai Tea Merchants Association, the Shanghai Tea Export Association, the Shanghai Store and Tea Association, and the Southeast Tea Region Factory Association, including Du Yong, Zhu Hua, and Shou Jingwei, entertained the press at the Xinghualou Restaurant on Fourth Horse Road yesterday afternoon. Shou Jingwei, former general manager of the China Tea Company, gave a speech, stating that tea is a major export product of China. Now that the tea season is approaching, he hoped that the government would expedite the tea loan program to purchase tea from various regions in order to maintain tea farmers and benefit foreign sales. Subsequently, Zhu Huiqing, Zhu Hua, Wu Juenong, Tang Jisan, and Sun Xiaocun reported on the tea production in Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, the plight of tea farmers and tea merchants, and the details of tea exports. They unanimously hoped that the government would quickly implement a tea loan program, requiring 100 billion yuan nationwide, to be loaned out before the Qingming Festival in order to save this year's tea production crisis. The associations have jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang and the Second Plenary Session, requesting that the responsible authorities be ordered to allocate special funds for tea loans, designate banks, and follow the already approved silk factory loan measures, whereby tea merchants first pay 30% as preparation and apply for a 100% loan from the designated banks.</p>
<h3>General Post Office - Shanghai Office Closed</h3>

The office was ordered to close on the 7th of this month, and all unfinished cases will be transferred to the Nanjing General Post Office for continued processing.</p>
<h3>U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Army - Royal to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Army Royal is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the United States on the 13th, where he will have several hours of stopover. Accompanying Assistant Secretary Royal will be General Stada, Director of the U.S. Mobilization and Demobilization Bureau, Lieutenant General Ruth, Chief of the Army Service Forces, Major General Burke, Chief of the U.S. Intelligence Liaison Department, Brigadier General Gatsburg, Staff Officer of the Operations Department, Brigadier General Gass, Staff Officer of the U.S. Air Force, and Todd, Director of the U.S. Foreign Property Clearing Commission. At the same time, a group of U.S. reporters will come to China after Royal to investigate and report on the news.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits Petition to the Government - Requesting Temporary Suspension of Road Demolition</h3>
<p>To Prevent Residents from Being Disoriented and Homeless</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a joint letter from Zhou Caigui and other representatives of merchants and residents living on boundary roads in the city, requesting that the government authorities temporarily suspend the matter of demolishing houses to make way for roads, has specially submitted a letter to the Municipal Government, stating that according to the residents, the notice No. 26 issued by the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration and Public Works Bureau on February 19, stating that "all houses obstructing boundary roads must be completely demolished before March 15," is no different from a bolt from the blue. The residents have endured hardships during the War of Resistance. If the demolition of houses on boundary roads is implemented, where will the hundreds of households find shelter in the midst of the city's housing shortage? Therefore, they are submitting a special document requesting that the government authorities quickly withdraw their order to relieve the hardship. It is the responsibility of the Chamber. Although post-war construction requires a hundred things to be done, it seems that making people avoid being disoriented and homeless should be the first priority. At a time when the housing problem is causing serious panic, the demolition and immediate relocation would leave thousands of people homeless and wandering the streets. This kind of tragic phenomenon, for the suffering people after the war, is truly difficult to remain silent about. It is reasonable to submit a letter stating the situation, hoping that the government will consider the people's livelihood and hardship, which has reached its extreme. The demolition and road construction of the Land Administration and Public Works Bureau should be temporarily suspended so that the residents of that road will not be disoriented and homeless.</p>
<p>Engineering Benefit Fee</p>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Recently, due to the widening of Zhongzheng Road, Zhejiang Road, and other roads in the city, shops along the roads have been charged an "engineering benefit fee." In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited a senior official of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, who explained as follows: Widening roads can make the city prosper and increase the value of real estate. Shops on both sides benefit the most, so it is reasonable to pay a corresponding fee. Twenty years ago, cities such as Guangzhou, Taishan, Wuzhou, and Nanning in China also adopted this method when expanding roads. Therefore, citizens should recognize their own interests and pay according to the regulations for the benefit of both public and private sectors.</p>
<h3>Repatriation of Japanese Nationals Expected to Be Completed by the End of June</h3>

The Bureau has issued a notice to all tap water companies in the city to strictly comply with these standards.</p>

<h3>Labor Unrest in Department Stores Eases - Management Agrees to Reopen Immediately - Prepared to Accept the Mediation Decision of the Social Affairs Bureau - Four Workers Detained by Wing On Company Have Been Released</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The labor unrest in major department stores in this city, such as Wing On and Sincere, took a turn for the worse after management voluntarily closed the stores at noon on the 7th, and a bloody incident occurred at the Wing On Company at noon on the 8th. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce first sent a letter to the management of each company, advising them to reopen. Yesterday afternoon, Wu Yunfu, a leading figure in the city's industrial and commercial circles, and Section Chief Zhang of the Social Affairs Bureau worked hard to persuade the companies to reopen, and it is said that they have achieved good results. The management agreed to reopen immediately. They are also prepared to accept the mediation decision of the Social Affairs Bureau, including a base salary of 60 yuan for employees, 50 yuan for probationary employees, and 45 yuan for trainees. They do not intend to apply to the Municipal Government for arbitration again.</p>
<p>Reopening Likely After the Day Off</p>
<p>The labor side has no objection to the Social Affairs Bureau's decision, so it is expected that each company can resume operations starting tomorrow.

After requesting instructions from Mayor Qian, Director Wu, in view of the minor nature of the case, approved bail, so the four employees were released at around 4:00 PM yesterday, and a wave of unrest is about to be resolved smoothly.</p>
<p>British Tramways Fully Operational</p>
<p>The strike caused by the arrest of three representatives of the British Tramways Company has been completely quelled as of yesterday.

<h3>Sayings About the Rejection of Northern Air Mail Are Not True - The Authorities Have Now Explained the Truth</h3>
<p>Recently, due to China National Aviation Corporation's reduction of the quantity of mail and newspapers transported to the north, rumors of "rejection" and "prohibition of transport" have arisen. However, according to the responsible authorities, there are currently one thousand several hundred people from various departments applying to go north to take over work. In addition to ordering the Ship Allocation Committee to find ways to dispatch ships to Qingdao and Tianjin for transportation, the quantity of mail and newspapers transported to the north by air is too large, accounting for one-fifth of the total air transportation volume. Therefore, for the sake of weighing priorities, the China National Aviation Corporation was instructed to temporarily reduce the number by half in order to free up capacity for passengers. This is actually a temporary measure. Once concrete measures have been formulated, the restrictions will be lifted and mail and newspapers will be transported to the north as much as possible.</p>
<h3>The Case of Robbery and Kidnapping at the Haijing Factory Solved - Extremely Valuable Stolen Goods - All Recovered in Hefei Road and Other Places - More Than Ten People Arrested and the Investigation Continues</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] After the victory, the Japanese-owned Haijing Paper Mill at No. 101, Lane 770, Huashan Road, Shanghai West, was sealed by the authorities, and a large number of paper, machinery, and other assets in the factory were sealed. Unexpectedly, at 1:30 AM on the 7th, several men in military uniforms and plain clothes, leading more than ten laborers, rushed to the factory in several cargo trucks.

After the victory, it moved to Shanghai and was preparing to resume publication.

<h3>Bank of China Continues Allotment, Gold Prices Still Rise, US Dollar High at 2200</h3>
<p>The temperature yesterday ranged from a high of 45.9 degrees to a low of 39.6 degrees.</p>
<p>Yesterday, smelted gold continued to trend from stable to brisk. It opened at 1.68 million in the morning, and after the opening, it was initially very calm. Silver shops made slight replenishments, and people were anxious and absorbed it. Before long, it returned to around 1.78 million. At this time, it was close to the time for the Bank of China to announce the exchange rate, so buyers temporarily watched, and it struggled greatly below 1.75 million for a long time. When fellow merchants obtained 468 bars at a price of 1.7 million, spot sales once again became strong, and the price once rose to 1.8 million before noon, then slightly declined, struggling around 1.75 million. As a result, the closing price continued to rise by 80,000 compared with the previous day. Silver shop jewelry was 190,000, tael silver was 1,600, and silver dollars still hovered at the original price. The black market for short-term lending was initially loose and then tight, first at 15%, and finally at 22%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars followed the gold market's ups and downs, and the situation was quite stable. It opened at 2150 yuan in the morning, with the lowest bid price seen at 2100 yuan, and then gradually stabilized. Before the announcement of the US exchange rate, it hovered around 2150 yuan. At noon, it reached a high of 2200 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold market had no good news, so it fell slightly to around 2150 yuan. As a result, the closing price rose slightly by 30 yuan compared with the previous day. Hong Kong dollar tickets fluctuated, and the result was a drop of 10 yuan. The situation of new goods was similar to that of old goods. After hovering, the price of 1947 declined slightly by yuan, and the price of 1948 was flat. Hong Kong Telegraph rose to 435 yuan, and Robby Telegraph also rose to 520 yuan, both belonging to Hong Kong orders for settlement.</p>
<h3>Bulls Actively Manipulate, Securities Initially Weak Then Strong</h3>
<p>Public bonds were very stable yesterday, just hovering. Type C bonds opened at 2180 yuan in the morning and were quickly pulled up to above 2310 yuan. Then, the bulls once showed their hand, first retreating to 2150 yuan. The noon closing price was 2250 yuan, a slight increase of 50 yuan compared with the previous day. Type E bonds also took the second most popular position, rising by 50 yuan. The three types of miscellaneous brands, A, B, and D, did not move. Shanghai stocks entered a soft market at the beginning. Yong Yarn once fell to 3300 yuan, Meiya below 2450 yuan, and Jingfu around 155 yuan. Later, due to the stagnation of the gold market due to the distribution, speculative funds had no way out and gradually returned to the market, gradually improving. At noon, they all showed a high point, with Yong Yarn reaching 3750 yuan, Meiya 2850 yuan, and Jingfu 170 yuan. Then there was a slight pullback. As a result, Yong Yarn and Meiya each rose by more than 100 yuan compared with the previous closing price, Jingfu rose by 2 yuan, Xinguang by 5 yuan, Qinxing was flat, and Xinhe rose by 10 yuan. In the afternoon, the asking price rose again by as much as 10%, but there were many futures deliveries, and foreign stocks also gradually became active. Yisha had large investors emerge, and there were many transactions at 6400 yuan. The rise was slightly hit, affecting other stocks, and there was a slight pullback. The process was generally stable. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Yisha fell by 100 yuan, Yipi by 150 yuan, Paper Industry by 170 yuan, Steel Industry by 50 yuan, and Asia by 100 yuan. The rest were mediocre and unremarkable. Yeguang was relatively deserted, and the asking price was raised, making it difficult to complete transactions.</p>
<h3>Victory Bonds to be Promoted and Sold in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The total amount of the 34th Allied Victory Bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance was 5 million yuan. Since the issuance began in July last year, it failed to end by the end of the year, so it was extended for half a year until the end of June this year. Now, a portion of these bonds will be allocated to financial, industrial, and commercial circles in this city for underwriting.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Turns into Speculative Commodity, Securities Gang Invades the Market, Flower Prices Also Rise in Turn</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to rise sharply. 20-count Double Horse suddenly rose to 1.17 million again, and 16-count Guangming was also approaching the 1 million mark. Ever since the securities gang buyers invaded the yarn market, these two brands have been used as a tool. The price of Double Horse warehouse receipts has exceeded the spot price, which shows that the speculative atmosphere is heavy. Other 20-count brands also rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Although people are supportive, sales have not been smooth. The Textile Construction Company opened sales of woolen fabrics, cotton blankets, and other items totaling 25 kinds yesterday. It is reported that cotton yarn will be sold as usual next Monday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York cotton telegrams reported that US cotton futures and spot goods were priced at around 12 to 23 pounds. In the local cotton market, except for Textile Construction and private cotton mills that remained on the sidelines and took a wait-and-see attitude, cotton merchants were not lonely with each other due to the strong yarn prices. Prices rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan compared with the previous day.</p>
<h3>Tinplate Has Softened</h3>
<p>Since last year, the sales of tinplate have been smooth, and the rising trend has been fierce for several months, which is rare. Unfortunately, the peak must decline. Recently, transactions have fallen into a standstill. Canned food manufacturers have gradually had enough inventory and have temporarily stopped buying. Moreover, there is talk of overseas orders arriving soon, so prices are stagnant and are softening daily.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Still Tight, Flour Prices Rise Another 300-400 Yuan</h3>
<p>The rice market is tight due to rainy weather and fewer goods arriving. People are very supportive of prices. Yesterday, the person in charge of the association still advised the same stable prices. If the weather turns clear and there are more sources, the market may soften. Flour prices continued to rise by 300-400 yuan, oil prices continued to rise by 2,000-3,000 yuan, soybeans rose by another 500-600 yuan, soybean cakes also rose by 200 yuan accordingly, bran is showing a strong trend, raw kernels rose by more than 1,000 yuan, and the future situation still depends on the shift in sales.</p>
<h3>Swedish Newspaper, Over 1,000 Tons Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The well-known Swedish paper merchant in this city, Weichang Trading Company, has started business. It is learned that the company's Tonghai Wheel has arrived in Shanghai for many days. Because there is no reliable pier in the port, it is temporarily anchored outside the port and will be imported today, berthing at the China Merchants Bureau Pier No. 1. It is reported that the ship brought a large number of goods from the central region, including more than 1,000 tons of white printing paper. The Swedish white printing paper is the first batch to arrive in Shanghai after the war.</p>
<h3>Rice Loan of 200 Million, Rice Merchants Must Have the Same Amount of Capital</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The rice market has been affected by the colder and rainy weather in recent days, and the sources are somewhat affected. In addition, gold prices have risen again, causing them to advance to higher peaks every day. A few days ago, Beigeng once again knocked on the 30,000 mark, and Thin Rice was 28,000. Yesterday, the police station sent personnel to closely monitor the rice market, so transactions became idle, and prices were similar to those of the previous day. Very few transactions were made. Afterwards, the reporter was informed by Xing Zhigang, managing director of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, that the future of the rice market is expected to decline, and that the food for the people in this city is expected to be worry-free. A person in charge of the Grain Administration Office also told the reporter that Yang Xizhi, the special commissioner of the office, is expected to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow after flying to Chongqing to ask for instructions on the grain policy of this city. By then, the plan for purchasing rice loans will be earnestly implemented. The sources, procurement, transportation, supply, and adjustment of rice and grain all have a careful and complete plan. If implemented step by step, they can always be promoted to their full advantage. It is also reported that the United Nations will have 20,000 tons of rice shipped in batches.</p>
<p>Yang Xizhi, the special commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration, went to Chongqing to meet with Minister Xu to ask for instructions on the 200 million yuan rice merchant loan. It is reported that after verification, all bean and rice firms can obtain this loan, but the amount of the loan will be determined according to the ability of their original capital to purchase rice and grain. That is, if a certain rice firm can have 1 million yuan of working capital to purchase rice and grain, it can borrow 1 million yuan from the office. There are two purposes for this regulation: (1) to ensure that all rice merchant funds are used to purchase rice and grain, and (2) to prevent these funds from flowing into other industries. If this method is implemented, the city's rice merchants can use at least 400 million yuan of funds to purchase a total of 200,000 stones of rice at one time. It is also learned that the four state-owned banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture have allowed the issuance of this loan, and the interest rate is 3%.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Tea Market The varieties of red and green tea have recently become narrower, buyers are not smooth, and they are trying to suppress prices in every possible way. However, those who hold the goods are reluctant to sell them lightly due to the high cost, so supply and demand are scarce, and the market is still stable.</p>
<p>Timber Yesterday, the timber market was trending steadily. Because the price of gold rose, people were excited, but the weather was rainy, and sales were not good, so transactions were quite scarce.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials Caustic soda rose slightly, but few transactions were made. It is heard that deliveries next month are about 30-40% lower than the market price. It is heard that Bunem will distribute goods next week, but the number of sites is not large, and the market price is rising.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities Yesterday, there were few transactions at the beginning. Later, because various counterparts on this street added some items, the market was still not prosperous. As a result, except for Arrow Knife, the rest of the soap returned to small. Western candles were stable, and the Beautiful brand of matches was favored, and the market was slightly firm. Phoenix also stood on the original market.</p>

<h3>Construction of New North Station Requires 300 Million, Railway Authorities Plan to Request Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] It is reported that a new and large railway station will soon appear in this city to meet the needs of this city as a national commercial center. The existing North Railway Station in this city was completed in the 31st year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. The top two floors of the North Station Building were destroyed by artillery fire during the January 28th Incident. With the current congestion of passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways every day, the station is really not enough to cope. The two railway authorities are now preparing a plan to build a new North Railway Station in this city. If the project is completed, it will cost 300 million yuan. The planned new North Station covers an area of ​​about 520 feet long and about 60 feet wide, between the current North Station and the current North Station Building, and is a six-story building. The ground floor of the new building has ticket windows, station master's office, luggage room, waiting rooms for passengers of all levels, telegraph management room, new-style wine row room, etc.; and there are special rooms for rent for business operations and public bus companies, etc. The remaining floors will be the writing rooms of the two railway administrations. The current North Station Building facing the boundary road will be converted into a station hotel. It is reported that the project will soon be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval to start construction.</p>

<p>Film and Theater "Model Teacher" Performance Special Issue</p>
<h3>"Model Teacher" Performance Preface</h3>
<p>— Luo Xuelian</p>
<p>Drama is the most powerful weapon for propaganda and education. In the eight years of arduous Anti-Japanese War, the dramatic movement developed vigorously and made the most rapid progress: dramatists have made indelible contributions to inspiring people, encouraging popular sentiment, and awakening the national people to dedicate themselves to the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>The China Electric Drama Troupe was established in 1938. Initially, it was an organization in Lai Yu of the Central Film Studio. Later, as the work expanded, it became a formal group under the Central Film Studio. Over the years, it has successively performed dozens of plays such as "Peach and Plum Spring Breeze", "Earth Returns to Spring", "Punishment", "Song of Righteousness", "Golden Jade Mansion", "Mountain City Story", "Model Teacher", and "Rhapsody of a Little Man". I dare not boast about the merits and demerits of the achievements, but I have never dared to slacken my diligence and dedication in advancing with the Anti-Japanese War and growing with the audience. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has victoriously ended and the work of national construction is urgently needed to be accelerated, the China Electric colleagues detoured through Hunan and Hubei and rushed to Shanghai, hoping to report to the compatriots in the recovered areas and call on the whole country to move forward towards the road of national construction. "Model Teacher" is a masterpiece by Mr. Yuan Jun. It has been performed in Chongqing for a long time. It has been deeply loved and highly praised by the audience for its profound description and grand significance. President Jiang personally watched the play on his 58th birthday and also gave awards. China Electric chose it as the first performance program to meet the people in Shanghai. The lineup of actors is mostly the same. After being re-rehearsed, it is hoped that there will be more progress. I hope that people from all walks of life will give advice, and I especially hope that all parties will help the troupe's future work, which will be extremely honored and eagerly anticipated.</p>
<h3>Era</h3>
<p>— Tie Mei</p>
<p>"Model Teacher" writes about three generations of teachers: Fang Yida, Fang's son-in-law Lin Tong, and Lin's son-in-law Guan Shenghong. Lin Tong and Guan Shenghong both have lifelong partners who understand and can help them - Fang Errou and Lin Xiaorou.</p>
<p>The actors who play these characters in the play are Yue Lu (Fang), Geng Zhen (Lin). Zhang Yan (Guan), Bai Yang (Erer) and Sally (Xiaorou).</p>
<p>For them, what I especially want to point out here are the two characters Lin Tong and Fang Errou. On the stage, they both experienced twenty years of time, which means that the author wrote about their young age (the May Fourth Movement) and their old age (after the Anti-Japanese War), so the actors were required to play young people and have to play old people.</p>
<p>On the Chongqing stage, everyone knows that Bai Yang and Geng Zhen are accustomed to playing young people. But when Geng Zhen played "Shi Dakai", it was no longer a young role. Bai Yang in "Golden Jade Mansion" played a mother in her forties and fifties. They expanded the scope of their performance. I think a good actor should have this ability.</p>
<p>Stereotyped acting is not a training. Actors who rely on a set of housekeeping skills limit themselves. Now, how are Geng Zhen and Bai Yang's acting skills? It is not convenient to make a hasty judgment. Let's talk about it after the official premiere; however, this is undoubtedly a road that should be taken.</p>
<p>Similarly, in his personal experience, Zhang Yan has more opportunities to play old people, but now he is a young and strong lad.</p>
<p>The three generations of education circles who are steadfast have appeared on the stage. We also hope that there will be such a family in the actors. This requires actors to develop themselves in many aspects on the stage (adapt to many roles), never leave their jobs, perform from the age of twenty to sixty or seventy, young people can play old people, and old people can play young people.</p>
<h3>The Story of "Model Teacher"</h3>
<p>In 1919, during the May Fourth Movement, Fang Yikui, an old professor at a university in the western suburbs of Beiping, held a tea party at home to introduce the newly hired lecturer Lin Tong, but it clearly aroused the jealousy of those such as gilded professors Lou Guodong and Shi Yunjia. Only the old Professor Fang and his daughter Fang Errou understood and respected him. Only in this bit of warmth did Lin Tong feel at ease to accept the letter of appointment and work.</p>
<p>A year later, Lin Tong had already won the universal love of the students at the school. On the eve of the May Fourth Movement, he led the students to prepare to march and demonstrate to the traitors Cao Zhang and Lu You. Old Professor Fang Yikui himself was unable to participate due to illness, but he strongly supported them. Fang Errou also resolutely rejected the marriage proposal of Zheng Chuxiong, a classmate who was hot for five minutes and ended badly, and followed Lin Tong into the tide of the great era.</p>
<p>The May Fourth Movement broke out vigorously, but Lin Tong and his colleague, the art teacher Liu Fuwan, were unfortunately arrested and detained for more than fifty days. Fang Errou's anxiety revealed her love for Lin Tong, which made Fang Yikui feel a little comforted in his anxiety and critical illness. Finally, with the support of the national strike, market strike, and school strike, Lin Tong and others were finally released. In the warm cheers of countless students, he took Errou's hand and said: "Errou, I will never leave you again."</p>
<p>Time flies, Lin Tong taught at the university for 20 years. After the outbreak of the sacred Anti-Japanese War, he also moved to Changsha with the school. His student Zheng Chuxiong became the dean of the Faculty of Arts. He himself also had a daughter Xiaorou and a son Xiaotong. His family life was happy and beautiful, but the country was in turmoil, and this kind of happiness was destroyed. A bomb blew up their family property, and most of the school buildings were also bombed. The school had to agree to the students' request and move to Kunming on foot. Lin Tong led the students on a rugged long journey again. He was always with the students.</p>
<p>Later, in a small inn on the way to Kunming, it was drizzling. Lin Tong's son Xiaotong fell ill. Lin Tong was busy greeting the students and Rou to their residence, food, and encouraging the students' emotions. He had no time to take care of him. Student Guan Shenghong and others wanted to ask him to stay for another day to treat Xiaotong's illness, but he refused. Suddenly, Lou Guoliang, who had changed his career and became the boss of a transportation company, also unexpectedly met in this small town. Although he met an old friend in his hometown, today's Professor Lou was purely a market salesman full of alcohol. Under the low and dark eaves, Xiaotong finally died muttering. In unparalleled grief, Errou said with tears in her eyes: "Let's leave early tomorrow morning!"</p>
<p>Five years passed again. The Anti-Japanese War entered the most difficult stage. Many professors, like Zheng Chuxiong, could not stand the poverty and changed their careers to do business. Only Lin Tong, although so poor that he did not have money to treat Errou's illness, buy medicine, boil water, or buy charcoal, still remained poor and self-sufficient and taught tirelessly. Lin Tong destroyed his family to relieve the country's difficulties, his son died and his wife was sick. After teaching for half his life, what reward did he get? Zheng Chuxiong said: "There is no reward for teaching!"</p>
<p>There is a reward, this reward comes from the vast number of students. Under his influence, his daughter Xiaorou and his student, who is also his new son-in-law Guan Shenghong, swore to him that they would teach for a lifetime. At the same time, countless of his students automatically opened a "Celebration of Professor Lin Tong's 25th Anniversary of Service at the School" to express their admiration for him. In the cheers, Lin Tong and Errou accepted the "Model Teacher" banner with tears in their eyes.</p>

<h3>Words and Deeds of a Model Teacher</h3>
<p>We cannot, like grass covering insects, turn our heads and seek another path as soon as we encounter difficulties. The cause of education, like any cause, can only discover its meaning by resolutely overcoming difficulties and weathering tribulations.</p>
<p>--Fang Yikui</p>
<p>It's a rather tragic thing when national affairs must be questioned by students... But, having reached this point, have the esteemed gentlemen in our government uttered a single word of questioning? Do these traitors have even a shred of restraint? If our students don't shout, who will? If our students don't ask, who will?</p>
<p>--Fang Yikui</p>
<p>You are happy because you give; because you give people knowledge and happiness.</p>
<p>--Lin Tong</p>
<p>For every additional person who makes a fortune off the nation's troubles, the nation loses one more unit of vitality. For every additional person who steadfastly holds their post, the nation gains one more unit of strength.</p>
<p>--Lin Tong</p>
<p>It's easy to do something brave on the spur of the moment, but it's truly difficult to persistently and painstakingly adhere to an ideal.</p>
<p>--Lin Tong</p>
<p>I can't imagine that someone who is a professor, someone responsible for educating other people's children, would also play the tricks of a politician!</p>
<p>--Lin Tong</p>
<h3>Ode to a Model Teacher</h3>
<p>--Fang Yikui</p>
<p>You are someone who sows seeds on the land of the motherland.</p>
<p>You are a wise man of humanity,</p>
<p>Because you give,</p>
<p>Therefore, you are happy;</p>
<p>For the citizens of the infant era,</p>
<p>You have cultivated countless flowers of wisdom.</p>
<p>Lin Tong</p>
<p>In the dense forests of desolate Yan,</p>
<p>Our wise men,</p>
<p>Have already discovered that you will be</p>
<p>A towering, magnificent tree,</p>
<p>Giving you sunshine,</p>
<p>Giving you the nourishment of love.</p>
<p>Facing the storms of the era,</p>
<p>You finally stand up strong,</p>
<p>Like a lighthouse in the raging waves.</p>
<p>With the brilliance of your wisdom,</p>
<p>Illuminating the paths of the children,</p>
<p>Brightening the memories of the descendants.</p>
<p>Fang Errou</p>
<p>Like a clear flowing spring,</p>
<p>Like dewdrops on glistening flower buds,</p>
<p>Nourishing the unseen</p>
<p>Roots of wisdom,</p>
<p>For the sun-loved</p>
<p>Plump fruit,</p>
<p>Like the spring sun nurturing all things,</p>
<p>You rejoice in the tender shoots</p>
<p>With a green vitality.</p>
<p>Fang Xiaorou</p>
<p>Just like your mother,</p>
<p>You are in the garden of wisdom</p>
<p>A fragrant flower.</p>
<p>From the dark nights of wind and rain,</p>
<p>To greet the morning sun of dawn.</p>
<p>When the sun shines,</p>
<p>You will be a pair of vigorous wings,</p>
<p>Soaring in the clear sky of the motherland,</p>
<p>Carrying the words of the wise,</p>
<p>Singing praises to the spring of the motherland.</p>
<p>Guan Shenghong</p>
<p>With the strength of steel,</p>
<p>With the might of a lion,</p>
<p>Crossing countless rivers and mountains,</p>
<p>Bearing the wind and frost of the motherland on your shoulders,</p>
<p>From your loud and clear name,</p>
<p>We have already heard the</p>
<p>Voice of the future era.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Criticism of Performances in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Among the several programs performed successively during this foggy season, we believe that "Model Teacher" is indeed the most complete and wonderful play. At a time when Chongqing's theater movement is intentionally or unintentionally leaning towards amusement and gimmicks, being able to see such a regular and conscientious performance is not only commendable but also prompts us to express our infinite respect to the group from "China Electricity"!</p>
<p>--Collective Criticism, Chongqing Xinshu Bao</p>
<p>"Model Teacher" wrote about a topic that is difficult to be liked, but the author was able to handle it into a refined and popular masterpiece. In terms of artistic achievement, we should give it a high evaluation... The play further demonstrates the author's energetic spirit and passionate enthusiasm, and is more skillful in technique.</p>
<p>--Mr. Langqin, Shixing Chao Wenyi</p>
<p>"Model Teacher" truthfully depicts a great personality that is not easy to depict truthfully, and also vividly depicts a realistic lesson that is not easy to depict vividly... Due to the proper allocation of actors, harmonious cooperation, and dedicated performances, it must also be due to the director's precise handling and concise depiction of emotions, making this "high-level intellectual play" easily accepted by the general public. --(Mr. Keni, Chongqing Xinmin Bao)</p>
<p>The play flashes with a high Te-mpo, a freely rotating rhythm, and a complex and compact compilation, like a gurgling stream, passing through rock forests, making the sound of metal and stone. --(Mr. Shu, Chongqing Xinmin Wanbao)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes</h3>
<p>In "Model Teacher," there are many hairstyles. Shen Yang's head is bald, Liu Housheng's is covered with luxuriant grass, Bai Yang's is evenly divided, and Si Huzi's crown is tilted up toward the sky.</p>
<p>There are five child actors in "Model Teacher," causing great trouble for the stage crew. It is said that five nannies, male and female, have now been found to take charge separately.</p>
<p>Li Enjie, the set designer for "Model Teacher," has a toothache. Due to overwork and tension, the ailment suddenly broke out, confining him to bed for three days, crying and suffering endlessly, hence his name "Innocence."</p>
<p>Some say that Bai Yang has successfully become a thousand-faced person among actors. This time, she started playing a maiden of the May Fourth era and continued to play an old woman during the War of Resistance, truly "playing each role like the real thing."</p>
<p>Geng Zhen also started playing a young man and continued to play an old man during the War of Resistance, but Shen Yang started playing the old man and continued to play his son, going back in time instead.</p>
<p>A well-wisher wrote a couplet for "Model Teacher," saying: Geng Zhen, the model teacher of the ages; Bai Yang, the eternal example of virtue.</p>
