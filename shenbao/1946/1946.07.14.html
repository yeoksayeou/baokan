<h3 id="c1">主席今日飛潯轉廬　馬帥俟晤司徒雷登後偕蔣夫人續往　三人會議日內可望舉行 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕蔣主席定明晨乘美齡號專機逕飛九江，轉赴廬山。聞專機抵潯時，將接見贛省政軍黨團各首長，並慰問闊別九年之贛省父老，曁各界同胞，隨行者有國府文官長吳鼎昌，及國府高級職員數人。主席之隨從擬分乘兩機赴潯。另據悉：主席因聞南昌九江各界將作盛大歡迎，以時當溽暑，恐勞久候，曾去電致謝，聞主席抵潯小休後，將親臨南昌巡視。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕聞蔣夫人因擬陪同馬帥夫婦留京候晤司徒雷登，故擬於明日下午飛潯，一說馬帥在京尚有待，但不致久留，因匡廬馬帥行館已掃榻以待矣。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十三日電〕司徒雷登定十五日飛京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕國共商談今日竟日寂靜逾恒，首都記者之注意力現已轉移於主席曁馬帥等赴廬山之行期，及美駐華大使司徒雷登之抵京日期。司徒大使抵京後，聞將住馬帥行館，馬帥如有赴廬之行，亦必待司徒大使抵京後決定。今日據馬帥行館消息，馬帥確有赴廬消夏之意，惟此不足說明馬帥對國共商談已有倦意，因京中今日盛傳政府與中共各項未決問題之商談，可能全部移至廬山繼續舉行，外交部業於半月前派員赴廬山，為各國駐華使節佈置住所。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕據某權威人士談：主席赴贛後，就目前種種跡象觀察，和平談判似仍擬在京繼續舉行，在國共商談是否將移廬山，則須視事實發展之程度以為斷。截至今晚十一時止，尚未聞雙方代表有赴廬說。目前廬山最大之困難，為房荒，因在過去九年中敵偽施諸於廬山者，惟破壞而未聞建設，贛省府現正積極計劃興建房屋中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕據可靠方面息：軍事三人會議可能移廬山舉行，並聞陳誠總長因病體尚未復原，不宜乘坐飛機，將搭乘專備之軍艦赴廬。又曾舉行四次會議之五人商談，因若干問題無法獲得解決目前不致召集。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕軍事三人會議可望於最近期內舉行，政府方面現正針對中共方面所提蘇北中原兩地區之共方部隊轉移華北之要求，擬議一方案，期使此一重大枝節問題獲合理解決</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕中委梁寒操，日內由滬返京轉往廬山，應三民主義青年團中央團部之請，至廬山夏令營講學。吳秘書長鐵城，陳部長立夫亦擬赴廬。</p>
<p>周恩來昨訪馬帥</p>
<p>談黃河堵口問題</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕馬帥行館之隨從譯官等今對京記者羣之採訪，其態度更趨緘默，緣馬帥認為無意義之透露，實於事實無補，惟悉今日下午二時，周恩來曾訪馬帥，長談達三小時，至五時半始出，談話內容為黃汎及救濟物資兩題，關於黃汎一事，因黃河之修堤堵口工程迫在眉睫，今花園口已將工竣，水勢自應歸復舊道，然而共方對修堤工程，則故事拖延，並諉過於政府不付工款，以致無法進行。據聞今日周恩來晤見馬帥時，曾謂如政府於花園口堵口工程完竣後放水舊道，彼等為「自衛計」，當在下游築高堤一座，使黃水倒灌，置開封等地於澤國，擬請馬帥將此意代呈主席。此雖恫嚇之詞，但中共用心之險惡，由此可以想見，證之中共過去殘民以逞之作風，此舉亦殊值注意。關於救濟物資一事，周恩來曾有一電致聯總署長。（請參閱第二版）</p>

<p>〔本報北平十三日電〕杜林即將會晤聲中，東北傳美方企圖於松花江北部建立一緩衝地帶，據悉，執行小組現已在松花江北岸，實行調處，擬以紅房子為緩衝地帶，國共兩軍各後退三千公尺，但政府中共雙方，對此尚未獲得完全協議，松花江上刻平靜無事，惟瀋陽以北形勢略緊，聞庫平一帶，增有共車萬餘，似圖反攻法庫。共軍將撤出哈爾濱之跡象日益顯著，現每日以七十噸車向佳木斯，齊齊哈爾搬運物資，傳顧祝同之赴東北，與準備接收哈爾濱有關。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社南京十三日電〕青年黨領袖左舜生本日接見法國新聞社記者，暢談時局觀感。謂召開國民大會一事，自屬合理之舉，本黨並不表示反對。大會召集尚有四月，在此期間，須解決下列三項問題：（一）國民大會代表確數及席次之分配；（二）憲法問題之繼續討論；（三）政府之改組。余並不反對召開政治協商會議，重行討論上述問題，但余特別贊助採取其他方法，如非正式交換意見，或政府及各黨代表間個別會議之類，但政協所通過之五項決議案之精神，仍當予以擁護。</p>

<p>〔中央社鄭州十三日電〕共軍（中原軍區）部隊，已對本年二月二十三日之羅山協定及五月十日白魯德，徐永昌，周恩來三氏於漢口成立之協議，破壞無遺。李先念指揮「中原軍區」所屬部隊文建武，王樹聲，張體學等部自六月二十五起擅行越出羅山協定所規定之地區（即中共部隊應停留平漢路東之白雀園，陳家畈，周家闈子，文殊寺，張家崗，張家灣，虎灣，石頭凹，棗樹岑間之地區）分向東西移動，廿九日開始大規模向各地國軍攻擊迄現在，其向東擴展者約二百　廿公里，侵至黃梅以北及皖境之立煌附近，地區向西擴展者約二百七八十公里，侵至保康附近及豫省之淅川，內鄉境內，共軍凡足踏之地，施行其一貫茶毒手段，殘殺老弱，焚燬房屋，奸淫婦女，掠奪物資，裹脅壯丁，造成地方大混亂，十室十空之慘局，刻仍在繼續擴大擾亂中。十一日共軍王樹聲縱隊二千餘，已進逼至保康東南十公里處，正繼續向城垣進迫。保康於抗戰時，期為第一綫之後方，當日寇數度渡越襄河西犯時，容納前方避難義民，屏障川北，對抗戰供獻殊偉，此一未被日寇擾及之區域，現竟罹共軍之蹂躪，令人無限悲痛。王樹聲縱隊後續三千餘，於十二日經流水溝（宜城南）企圖續渡襄河，但被國軍阻擊，未能得逞，國軍並對侵陷南漳之共軍，加以驅逐，已於十一日收復該城，人民正分由四鄉返歸，整理其被共軍破壞之產業，李先念所率之文建武縱隊之三股，於十二日分途由內鄉以南，李官橋以北，渡越丹江，經馬跨舖（淅川東十公里），繞越淅川以北，竄至淅川西北之大石橋附近，圖南渡丹江，進犯均縣，經國軍阻擊，刻正激戰中。共軍現企圖由南北會竄武當山，然後再圖繼續西寇川陜邊境，共軍另股約千餘，於十二日鑽隙竄至南陽方城閩地區，大肆破壞公路及電綫，地方民衆物資亦被搶掠一空。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕據中國方面人士可靠消息：由於中國政府向華盛頓聯總之強力要求，聯總巳允將醫藥供應及交通運輸設備，不列人停運物資之內，故汽車　火車機頭，駁船，汽油潤滑油亦已與糧食並列，仍得運往中國矣。蓋如無運輸設備之供應，則行總亦將無法達到賴伽第亞署長所望之分配糧食及物資至內地之任務也。上海方面，聯總上海分署當局稱，此事尙未接獲正式消息。惟信如有此事，則當公開宣布。並稱，即使醫藥及交通運輸工具等可照常運華，但價值最高之數項供應，如工業及農業機械設備等，則仍將在停運之列也。又稱：渠現尚不能證實此項數種物資完全停運，是否業經決定，但次種見解，甚屬合理，並稱：渠現覓取證實中國方面人士認爲拉氏停運令，實爲錯誤情報，錯誤了解，及倉猝行動，混合而促成者。渠等深信賴氏此次行動，事前並未確實自駐華聯總職員接獲最後電報，且並未充分重視蔣主席所答，「此事由宋院長辦理」一語。據最近統計數字：中國各港口情况近日已大改進，例如上海一地自六月二十七日以來，總計積存有救濟物資四十九萬一千二百三十七噸，其中有四十六萬四千五百十二噸，已分發內地，所剩者，僅爲原存總數百分之十，事實上關於運輸裝備及糧食之處理情况，實較該等數目所表明者爲佳，蓋受延誤者，主要爲農業及工業復興之重裝備，此等裝備必先在上海開箱檢查，從事裝配後，方能再運往內地。</p>
<p>賴氏述停運內情</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕聯合國善後救濟總署長賴伽第亞今日在參議院調查委員會報吿停運救濟物資至中國之內情，據稱：其所致蔣主席一電，以中國之福利係與全國人民有關，而非僅關任何個人或任何團體，故措辭率直，非外交辭令，蓋欲使之明瞭眞相也。該電曾謂：援助中國復興工作，須出以正眞，並謂：「貴國之福利，率關全國人民，不能用作應付任何個人或任何團體之特殊利益，是則個人與政治不能牽入，深信主席對此具有同感」。賴氏此電係宣佈停運救濟物資前發出，其日期亦在聯總上海方面職員三百人聯名提出控吿之前。賴氏在參院調查委員會，將中國方面救濟物資分配不滿意之責任，歸諸中國政府及行政院救濟總署，並謂：聯總中國分署自上至下，全部辦事不力，必須予以改組。賴氏致蔣主席電並調，救濟物資不運入內地，反而轉賣，致使大部份物資流入黑市，此種辦法必須加以變更。此項國際救濟物品之分配，對於政府公務員亦不能予以優待。行總必須多得經費，以利進行。爲改善計，中國政府可派代表三人與聯總代表三人會同討論，商定遠大計劃，以確保辦事成效與廉潔。賴氏並聲明，在本星期初出席參院委員會前，尙未接蔣主席覆電。賴氏今日出席參院委員會係應共和黨參議員白立治之要求，白氏在調查委員會稱：某某國家如何動用聯總救濟物品之事實全部曝露後，定必成一「國際貪汚案」。白氏反對停運救濟品至中國，同時對於南斯拉夫及波蘭則照常救濟，聯總救濟品在該兩國之濫用亦爲吾人所深知云。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處紐約十二日電〕紐約時報昨著論稱：六月寸九日送呈國會之聯總報吿認爲，救濟工作在中國其執行之難，無異緣木求魚。據謂：除非在一九四六年六月底前能以一百萬噸之食品運華，則五百萬至一千萬飢民可望不致餓斃，鑒於「聯總」截至目前所以做到者，此千萬飢民顯然無法獲救，六萬萬美元救濟計劃已吿流產。</p>
<p>賴伽第亞中止物資（除主要食品外）運華，此種步驟在形式上或屬需要，所遭殃者，乃千萬之飢民耳，我人必須加緊努力，促成中國之和平。</p>
<p>〔又電〕聯合國善後救濟總署今日證實接到上海方面職員三百人聯名控告中國分署辦事無效力情形。惟賴伽第亞對此無表示。華盛頓晚呈報評論稱：此事應由最高方面立即加以注意。聯總應進行澈底調查，並實施改善辦法，俾聯合國對華援助，能有誠實無弊大公無私及極少浪費之處置，美國人對於聯總捐款，實居大多數，故特別重視此案云。</p>

<p>國父在生時，常口口聲聲的對人講：「華僑是革命之母」。因爲我們在五十餘年前，國內革命志士，在國父領導之下，批滿淸專制的逆鱗，開始廣泛的作澈底消滅朽腐政治運動的時候，往往受着末日的淫威政治之壓迫，不得不向海外逃亡，如果沒有海外僑胞在經濟和人力方面的援助，我們中華民族的第一步民族革命的成功，一定要更艱苦和更遲緩的。</p>
<p>僑胞在這次綿長的八年抗戰之中，也證明立下了很大的功勞。初時他們捐欵獻機，異常踴躍。後來日寇在南洋侵略戰爭中，緬甸，越南，馬來亞，爪哇，蘇門答臘，以及新加坡菲律濱等地僑胞的生命和財產，也受了極大的殘殺和損害。僑胞無論在任何時期，任何環境，雖然在地域上遠遠的隔離着祖國，却始終仰望着祖國復興。今後我們在主席導引之下，要開始建設三民主義的民主國家，我們更需要海外的僑胞們，拿出力量來，幫助祖國，及早達成這個任務。</p>
<p>我們對僑胞們所期望的，旣如此其重大，但就目前各地僑胞本身所遭遇的來講，實在是太痛苦太不幸了。暹羅僑胞首遭慘殺，荷屬東印的僑胞最近也遭大規模的屠殺和襲擊，迄今猶未完全平息。此外，就我們所獲得的報吿，綜合起來，則有菲律濱，馬來亞，澳洲，越南等地政府，對於當地僑胞，也施行了法律上的壓迫和限制。僑胞們本來想，爲了我們在這次同盟國家進行消滅軸心國家的大戰中，立下大功，樹起了國威，在大戰終了以後，我們在南洋各地，當可獲得生活上的安全和當地政府比較客氣盼待遇。孰知到今天，就目前所呈顯出來的事實一看，結果適得其反，我們的「革命之母」海外生活，遍受着人家的凌辱壓迫和屠殺，比八一三前還要厲害。仔細一想，祖國在責任上在人情上，都對不起他們！</p>
<p>我們中華民族的性情，溫柔和平而良善，世所共知。僑胞在各地奉公守法，不肯稍稍逾越規矩，亦爲當地政府所能道。僑胞向以極忍耐和退讓的態度，來應付一切的凌侮。在工作方面，僑胞一向克勤克儉，孜孜不息，用了他們的血汗，在南洋各地開闢荒蕪，造成了今天的繁榮。僑胞在海外各地的應獲得安全與保障，並不是他們的一種過分的要求，而是理所當然的應可享受到的權利。無如俗語說「好人有人欺，」海外僑胞忠厚過人的行爲，反形成了大家以爲可欺的對象，眞不應該。</p>
<p>政府在目前，應當以一切可能的力量，爲海外一千五百餘萬僑胞爭取安全。必要時，政府尤當不惜採取强硬的姿態，萬不可一紙抗議，隨便了事，有時連抗議也不敢提。譬如暹羅原爲在這次戰爭中軸心國家方面的一個小丑角，論理，我們有權來懲戒她一下。常她更不自量力在今春慘殺我們僑胞的時候，我們立可派遺越南方面的大兵，進入暹羅的西北境，以爲講理的後盾。不料政府反百端忍讓，派遣使團，移樽就教，說了許多友好的說話，方才敷衍了事。不過暹羅下次如再發生虐待我們僑胞的事情，我們便不應當再採用這樣過於柔弱卑下的態度。又譬如越南，國軍方撤，而從前虐僑的舊法律，據報已在逐漸恢復起來。如果屬實，我們可老實的吿訴法國政府，越南本和我國歷史上有深切的關係，法國在越南的一切權利，早在這次大戰中，給不要臉的維琪政府因屈服而斷送得乾乾凈凈，現在我們把她從敵人方面收回來，再送還法國那末法國如對我們在越南的僑胞有不客氣的行爲，我們也當有權利再把她收回。我們現在再應當誠懇地吿訴印度尼西亞政府，如該政府再小能約束人民反華虐華的暴行，則該國英勇的獨立運動，將不爲我們之所同情，我們要援助僑胞，予以自衛與抵抗的力量。不論對什麼地方，我們有理可講的，對於保衛僑胞的態度，不應過於柔軟屈辱。因爲僑胞所居，散播世界各地，往往我們對一地善意的讓步，反引起其他地方以爲對我們僑胞儘可欺侮的誤會。</p>
<p>關於我們應當怎樣幫助僑胞的問題，從戰時回國的招待，以至戰後的遣送歸返原地，中央已規定得很多，不過目前最切要最緊急的，當莫過於維護他們在世界各地的安全。我們是一個和平立國的國家，決小會利用僑民，作爲侵略人家土地的先鋒；但人家對我們僑胞的安全存心侵害時，祖國的政府也不能視若無覩。</p>

<p>禮拜天淸晨，赫特遜河上，響著嘹亮的鐘聲。克拉蒙敎堂的老收師披著蕭蕭白髮，爲虔誠的善男信女們祈禱。他說：「今天，咱們美國人，有的是享受不盡的物質，然而我們都忽路了合理的精神生活。上帝賜給我們無窮的恩典，但是我們却辜負了上帝的恩典？」老牧師的話敲動著每一顆美國人的心！生活雜誌的記者寫通訊回國，說美國孩子們參加上海的黑市買賣。巴黎的美國記者們打電報回來，報導美國孩子們飲酒行兇，爭風吃醋的故事。房東太太的孩子，現在還駐紮着法國，她說：「孩子一度退伍回到家，但不到兩個月，他又自動入伍到歐洲去了。」老太太問我：「歐洲姑娘們究竟有什麼魅力？迷住了我的孩子？」麥克阿瑟將軍險遭不測的那天，紐約每家報紙上都刋着六十六萬三千元大騙案的標題，騙案的主角威廉朋吉朋的照片，和麥帥的肖像並排而立·這位大騙子在紐約落了網「僅僅三個月功夫，就是六十六萬三千元！」紐約的新聞紙讀者，在地下火車裏，在辦公室，在咖啡店，都認認眞眞看這一條消息。他們可以丟開巴黎四國外長會議的電訊不理，因爲那些開會是「政府的事，」甚至是「貝爾納斯的事」·</p>
<p>女兒閃電結婚　惱了幽默大師</p>
<p>同樣的林語堂的女公子林如斯小姐出奔的故事，被紐約日報用大標題刋在第三版。小姐爲避免父親的反對和一位美國海軍航空隊的廿六歲的畢峨中尉出奔到波士頓結婚。林語堂從紐約打長途電話給他們倆：他不願爲他倆祝福，因爲他反對任何「閃電戰式的婚姻。」平常銷路並不廣的美洲晚報，因爲刋載了一篇：「我怎樣殺死　索里尼」的特稿，兩天間，銷數打破了紀錄。凡列奧中校是義大利的共產黨員，去年四月底，墨索里尼在義北的共和法西斯政權一敗塗地時，凡列奧從米蘭奔到棠戈，從別的部隊手中，把墨索里尼和情婦巴蒂湘誘騙過來，然後用吉普裝到一個僻靜的城鎭，未經審判，用機關槍掃射而死。婚姻制度在美國的散亂，是任何國家所少見的。在蒙太那州的赫斯敦城七十四歲的老頭子韓頓，第一次結婚太太死去，第二次離了婚，最近復活節，第三次結婚，新娘維娜，才祗十六歲。五天以後，新聞記者又報導出維娜失蹤的消息，事後才知道，七十四歲的韓頓，是一個八百多畝田地的地主，他們結婚條件，是：韓頓死了以後，新娘可以享受幾分之幾的田產。但因沒有了「精神生活，」韓頓沒有死，新娘便單獨出奔了。</p>
<p>祗需記者兩名　新聞不虞缺乏</p>
<p>黃色新聞報紙每天祗需派兩名外勤記者，守在紐約法院的檢察處，報紙的新聞來源就可以取之不盡，用之無竭。七百七十萬人口的一個大都市，社會秩序原本是不容易維持的，美國人都敬佩他們的法院檢察處。美國律師認爲紐約的檢察處，是司法史上一個奇蹟。美國人說：如果當年杜威先生不奠定這一個檢察制度的基礎，如今如果要靠幾名警察來維持社會秩序，將不知亂成怎樣一個局面？現在紐約檢察處，有法官七十人之多，會計師十人，偵査專家十人，便衣偵探六十人，其他職員一百餘人。檢察處有權指揮紐約全市警察，每年檢察及提起公訴的安件達四萬件以上。這四萬件之中，有悲歡離合的故事，有殺人越貨的勾擋，也有社會隱伏着的可怕危機。有一個十六歲的小孩子，在波郎克區（紐約對河）打死了一個五十六歲的老婦人，僅僅祗是爲了對她「恨之刺骨。」另外一位十四歲的小孩子，替鄰居照顧嬰兒，嬰兒哭了，小孩子悶住她嘴巴，僅僅祇有兩分鐘，三歲的小嬰孩便一命嗚呼。十六歲和十四歲的孩子，先後都上了法庭。紐約下午報的主筆殷格索，用一整版的篇幅，寫了一篇社論：法律怎樣審判一個十四歲的殺人犯？他說：這不是一個單純的法律問題，而是一個美國最嚴重的敎育問題。</p>
<p>粉筆匠生活苦　教育界不景氣</p>
<p>觀察　詰首先叫出了「美國敎育破產」的呼聲。一位哈蘭羅蓋先生，大聲疾呼的說：「美國現在的敎育是一九一四年時代的敎材，五十年前的敎育方法！」就我所接觸過的美國朋友說，凡是有聰明才力的人，都不願意從事敎育工作。最大的理由是：敎師生活待遇太低，不足於荷負一個家庭的生活。據一九四二年及一九四三年的舊統計：美國的鄕村學校敎員，平均年薪爲一〇一八元，中學敎師平均年薪一九〇一元，大學講師一八七二元。而造船工人的年薪達三三七五元，印刷工人三二四九元，戰爭結束後，統計數字容或有些改變，在美國這樣一個工商第一的國家，敎師匠生活的淸苦，是無可掩飾的事實。因爲人才反被淘汰，濫竽充數的便佔有了美國敎育界。前幾天紐約附近一個鄕村小學的女敎師，留男小孩外出夜宿，並敎以各種　　行爲，引起全村家長的控吿。美國的電影深入農村社會的每一角落，但電影給兒童的敎育，不外愛情和暗殺！許多人說美國的大學敎育比從前貧乏，學生的數目加多了，敎授的敎村，還是很多年不變的藍本。有位中國學者，最近到紐約來，因爲多年被封在四川，想找幾本有關學科的美國新著，補充補充，但是失望得很：「今天美國大學所用的參考書，還是我當年在美國讀書時候的那一套。」但是任何大學行政當局的人，他們決不悲觀。戰時是反常的現象，戰爭過去了，他們認爲學術文化的黃金時代，就將在美國開花結果。歐洲的流亡敎授，第一流的學者。都流亡在美國，美國這一個世界的大鎔爐，將會替全世界的學術界，綺造一條嶄新的道路·（六月十四日寄自紐約）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕今日為法國國慶日，此間法僑將舉行慶祝會，以誌紀念。上午十時，法駐滬總領事裴揚思，將在金陵路法國領帶館舉行酒會，招待全滬法僑。十時半，招待吳市長夫婦及各國使節。十一時半，一部份法僑將在環龍路法國總會聚餐慶祝。下午一時邁爾西愛路前法國俱樂部亦有聚餐。下午三時半，裴總領事將在法艦「拉葛朗第埃」（即「偉大」）號上，以法國最高騎士榮譽勳章授予英人愛立克台維斯。緣台維斯氏僑居上海多年，為一工程師，法人與其為友者甚多。上海淪陷期間，法人被日寇逮捕者四起，台氏屢次冒險與法友互通訊息，協助出力，不辭辛勞。後渠本人亦遭日軍逮捕，禁閉於橋頭大樓，後又移入江灣集中營，橫肆酷刑，令其吐露法人秘密動態，然台氏受盡苦楚，郤堅不洩漏，致被打成跛。勝利後被釋，法人對之敬仰十分，均崇拜之，稱其為「騎士」。</p>

<p>肉（指豬肉而言），在食請上，該列入最重要的位置了。聖賢　上「三月不知肉味」的名句，留芳千古，至今猶膾炙人口，這足以說明：「肉」之於人生，確是一個富於誘惑性的名詞。</p>
<p>幸福的上海人，對於肉的享受，真可說是得天獨厚，你瞧：上海市區每一個角落，那一天不是肉味遍處香。</p>
<p>據可靠的統計，豬玀為了「進貢」上海市民而犧牲者，每月約五萬隻，平均每天均在一千六百隻左右，這筆數字，你能說它小嗎？當然，如果讓我們再細加推算：每隻諸假定體重一百斤，上海市三百五十萬人，計口分配定量，平均每人尚不足一兩豬肉。區區之數，何足道哉？</p>
<p>君莫　豬肉之多寡，且說那食客只曉豬肉吃在口中香，豈知香中酸辛味？豬肉來源誠不易，　商販戶處境也艱難。</p>
<p>上海　方，工商　萃，近郊　戶，亦畜豬，除滬西一帶有少數江北人畜豬供市外，百分之九十五，必須仰給於淮河南北及江北一帶的產豬。</p>
<p>我們平常在上海吃的豬肉，類別兩種：（一）淮豬，（又名火車豬。因係取道鐵路運輸至滬者）其產地是徐州·商邱·宿縣·明光·蚌埠等，沿淮河南北的地方。（二）江北豬，其產地是南通·淮陰·如皋·泰興·高郵·揚州等地。在目前，因為交通及其它關係，江北豬來路較淮豬為低，江豬佔百分之四十五，淮豬佔百分之五五。</p>
<p>在上列產地中，大多隸屬中共「解放區」販賣　　，收購豬　，必須歷盡　　，入「異域」。鈔票在中共地區不通用，江北購豬，大部是採取以物易物制度，雜糧交換豬仔，實不啻為現世紀之市塲，放一「異彩」。如此辦法，可就苦透販賣商人，因為兩地物價漲落不定，價不對頭，動　　蝕。即以最近數日豬肉行情為準，　豬竟　蝕二萬元。</p>
<p>商人將豬隻輾轉販運祇滬，經由豬行，轉售豬肉店，數度轉手之間，加上其它直接或間接之稅費十餘種之多，豬肉身價自是提高。</p>
<p>是暑夏的季節了，人們降低了豬肉的食慾，豬肉市塲的行情，日步低潮。來源不易，成本高，稅費重，生意清淡不及戰前，豬肉業商，搖首嘆息。</p>
<p>國事　　，戰雲　散莫測，有人在懷疑：如果打起仗來，豬源斷絕，上海是不是會造成「肉荒」現象？豬業商人說；戲法在人巧變，上海人不用愁，有的是豬肉。（姜軍）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕蘇浙皖區敵偽產業處理局長劉攻雲芸氏，昨日午後三時，在該局會議室舉行第二次記者招待會，席間對成立以來一般敵偽產業之接收及其處理情形，均有詳情報告。劉氏首謂接收經過，千頭萬緒，至目前始告一段落，但尚未完全停止。</p>
<p>依照行政院規定，在接收時應參考原始清册及各機關之移交清册，惟以本局成立較遲，先到各機關或已將接收原始清册散失，或有漏未接收，致使接收清點，頗難憑核。即已接收之清册，內容參差不一，品名數量單位，紛歧複雜，亦尚須詳加整理核對。截至最近止，收到之　册計有二千六百餘份，此外並經令飭日人連絡部造具移交清册，與各機關接收清册，詳加核對，大致在下星期內此項工作可以完成，屆時接收物資之確數，亦可明瞭，至物資走漏情事，如發生在接收之後，本局當負全責。</p>
<p>接收物資</p>
<p>接收物資總值，深為各方關注，惟本人今日負責說明，業已超過一萬億元，而上海以外地區之物資及漢奸逆產約有一千億元尚不計在內。是項物資大部份為布疋，顏料，房地產，倉庫碼頭，工廠，黃金，白銀，現鈔，傢具等，而由日方接收來者約佔五六成，餘為偽組織產業及少數查緝組依據密告查獲者。</p>
<p>查緝工作</p>
<p>關於查緝工作，為本局對外最招怨而亦麻煩之工作，查緝組所接獲之密告案，總數共有六千八百件，經受理查獲者有二千五百件，現尚有一部份在清理中，密告人之資金，亦尚有一部份未發，今後對漢奸財產之密報案件，仍由本局與法院會同受理，繼續偵查。至　逆產部份，在本局未到前由軍統局辦理，茲已陸續移交本局，於最近已點收完畢，共二百七十餘件，再本局根據密報而查獲者亦不在少數，關於漢奸財產之處理，現已由處理局與法院商定合作辦法，呈請行政院核定中，至於漢奸沒收財產，酌留家屬生活費之標準，現正由高院向司法行政部請示，於短時期內該部對酌留生活費之法令，當有解釋，則其標準亦即可決定矣。</p>
<p>處理標賣</p>
<p>敵偽物資之處理標賣，其最初目的在於平定本市物價，初期曾獲若干效果，旋以接收物資中日用品較少，致平賣之物資亦逐漸减少，本市物價復受其他原因直綫飛漲，本局乃改變平賣方式，委托各機關，如布委托中紡公司，糧食委托糧政處等，分別標賣，雖有相當成績，然未能完全滿意，而復值國庫需款，乃決定開倉庫大量發賣，將重要之物資標賣，次要零星者拍賣，查緝所獲之物資，組查緝物資標賣委員會，負責處理，工廠內之物資，亦將組工廠物資標賣委員會負責標售，以增加政府收入，並得騰空倉庫。據報告委托海關管理之倉庫，現已騰空一半，是項倉庫大部為民營，現已發還，並已歸由善救總署等租用。截止今日，標賣處置之物資已有二千八百卅億元，其中一千餘億元在上海賣出，二百餘億元為黃金，九百餘億元為布疋，由軍政部承購。近行政院規定，在六個月內，本局須增加二千億元，繳解國庫，以凑足五千億之數，設本市銀根緊，則標售較難故是否有把握，未敢預料，本局當盡最大努力去做，又本局標賣物資或工廠，今後決定採取低價公開辦法，則標售時，則可較為容易也。</p>
<p>審核產權</p>
<p>大局內最煩複之事項為審核產　，審　會每週舉行三次，迄今已有一〇三次，其所討論者，均即為民有產　之　邊，其中以工廠及房屋輪船佔多數，其審核程序最後須經行政院核准，關於產權案件，本局已辦理屬於工廠者有二千餘件，房屋四千九百餘件，其七千餘件，且此項案件，如處理太鬆，則外間認有弊端，太嚴則業主有告到行政院立法院者。其次為評價部份，一切物資工廠之估價，及密報獎金之確定，均由本局第二組評價決定，如估高，則外間不服，估低則政府有損失，故此項工作亦極煩重。</p>
<p>出售工廠</p>
<p>現已售之工廠有八十六單位（皆為小型廠），政府規定接收工廠除撥交中紡中　者外，其餘一律標賣，惟其中尚有八九工廠政府已決定撥給後方遷來之工廠經營。之後，劉氏復答記者問：（一）本局於本年　前尚不及　　，然亦不必待全部物資出售後結束，現內部各組已積極緊縮。（二）接收瀋查團於本月廿日左右可到滬，本局將以一切　料及　始清册等提供參考。（三）勞資及政府合作工廠，社會局　局長曾兩度與本人商討，請在接收廠中，撥發兩工廠　辦，現原則尚未確定。　接收房屋出售，為政府原定計劃，本局擴收之　　房產共有二千餘輪，但每輪皆有人住，空者極少，現擬於二星期後開始發賣，政府並具最大決心，於出賣時，凡居住於該項業產內者，一律勒遷，限期出空，担保買主房屋不出清不付款，將先行標售三百幢，並將此三百幢之　樣大小及低價先行公佈，承購者須向中央信託局申請後再行公開樣賣。</p>

<h3 id="c125">戶政疑義解答 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>問：何謂身份登記？有了籍別登記，何以又須身份登記？</p>
<p>答：籍別登記，在確定人之屬籍；身份登記在公證人在私法上之地位。同時因爲身份之得喪變更，可能變更其屬籍。例如：因結婚取得夫妻之身份則妻應以夫之本籍爲本籍。因離婚而喪失夫妻身份，則須變更其屬籍，所以有籍別登記，另須再有身份登記。</p>
<p>問：身份發記有幾種？</p>
<p>答：身份登記，有下列八種：</p>
<p>（一）出生登記—子女出生及發現葉兒。</p>
<p>（二）認領登記—認領非婚生子女，應爲認領之登記。</p>
<p>（三）收養登記—收養他人子女者，應爲收養登記。</p>
<p>（四）結婚登記—結婚者，應爲結婚之登記。</p>
<p>（五）離婚登記—離婚者，應爲離婚之登記。</p>
<p>（六）死亡登記—有死亡或受死亡宣吿者，應爲死亡或死亡宣吿之登記。</p>
<p>（七）監護登記。</p>
<p>（八）繼承登記。</p>
<p>問：上面的出生，死亡，或死亡宣吿，結婚，離婚，收養，承領，六種，一方面要申請設籍登記，或除籍登記，這裹又要申請身份登記，不是要辦兩個申請手續嗎？</p>
<p>答：不要的，這叫做一種申請，兩種登記。戶籍法施行細則第二十一條第二項規定：「同一件事，牽涉兩種以上之登記，仍塡具聲請書二份。」所以只要申請各種身份登記，受理登記機關，收到身份登記後，即可據此作設籍或除籍之登記。</p>
<p>三十二區公所函民政處，問：出生登記聲請書內「住址」欄，是否指聲請義務之住址，抑或當事人住址，未經明確規定，致塡寫時，每易清混。根據修正戶籍法第六章三十九條，在醫院監獄或其他公共塲所出生之子女，其父毋不能爲登記申請時，分別以醫院院長監獄長官，或其他公共塲所管理人爲聲請義務人。」茲有疑問兩點：（一）該欄如係當事人住址，將來對於該項登記發生疑問時，將無法尋覓該聲請義務人有所査詢。（二）該欄如係聲請義務人住址，則該表無法查明當事人之所在地，請賜解釋。</p>
<p>答：（一）出生登記聲請書聲請義務人姓各下之住址欄，係指聲請義務人之住址。（二）除父毋家長或同居人外，而爲出生登記之聲請者，應在「備註」欄內註明當事人之住址，以爲査考。</p>
<h3 id="c126">戶籍法施行細則（九） <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>（第廿七條）登記之變更更正或撤銷，應於戶籍登記簿登記事由欄登記之，如用紙不敷，仍就原欄標籤註明，加蓋戶籍主任名章。</p>
<p>用卡片爲登記者，準用第二十五條第二項之規定。</p>
<p>第四章　國民身份證</p>
<p>（第廿八條）製發國民身份證之縣，由縣政府統籌製備，發交鄕鎭公所，於戶籍登記後定期塡發。</p>
<p>塡發國民身份證，由鄕鎭公所編訂號碼，査塡完竣，彙呈縣政府審核蓋印後，發還鄕鎭公所，轉發受領人。</p>
<p>國民身份證以戶籍謄本代替者，準用國民身份證之規定。</p>

<p>— 朱民威</p>
<p>記者在三十英里的日本國東京路上，除了羨慕日本神村空軍外；復在快近橫濱時，看到路旁空塲上所停的美軍卡車，吉普與坦克的陣容（這些東西，在路旁二十尺外空塲上作爲廢物似的停留着，至少從去年美軍登陸東京灣即已開始。這些東西，目前已完全成了廢物，但象徵物主所以能叫日本屈服的癥結。這約莫構成一個軍海的衆多東西，在一個空洞國家來的人眼光下，是值得睜大眼睛去看的，可是在這裏不過是廢物一堆而已。美國人把他作爲統治的象徵，而不把它動一動。就像上海四百萬市民看到日本當年在北四川路底日軍司令部的坦克車陣一般。因爲他們知道血肉之驅擋不了鐵軌的輾軋的。</p>
<p>我們入橫濱市區以後，日本本土被毁滅的景象與日本資本主義結構同時並現。橫濱與東京雖爲兩個都市，實際上如同上海市及行將建設的江灣新市區，他們已合而爲一。橫濱憑着牠的海港，船塢，碼頭，倉庫，以及起重機，大鐵臂，作爲東京的吞吐口，東京則作爲橫濱的內室，餐廳，浴間，而互相依賴，我們車輪流走的馬路，寬坦潔凈，馬路上電車軌道，以及架空的電車纜的週密，這是日本四十年的物質結晶。大轟炸毁滅了橫濱與東京十分之六的房屋，但沒有把這二個都市交通系統以及路政毁滅。就憑這一點，東京與橫濱已是勝於上海的。而况日本像東京橫濱這種都市還很多</p>
<h3 id="c147">麥師他是救世主為日人療傷 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>麥帥在軍事上分佈占領軍如此少，其原因是在政治方面麥帥獲得了絕大成功，而無須動用大數量軍隊。由於給予日本若干表面主權，譬如：天皇依然爲日本政治上最高權力。日本政府的衆議院由民主傾向各政黨組成，但內閣則例由穩健派政黨領袖主持，執行麥帥總部決策。麥帥目前所急欲得到的管制成效，不是表揚占領國的威風，或滿足占領國對日本的需求，而係根據日本人民的最低生活要求，謀求這一塊土地上的七千萬人口安定。所以日本有一刋物畫而說麥帥正爲受傷的日本人包傷，麥帥的眞正企圖亦是希望日人傷愈後再派以勞役任務。</p>
<p>根據這點，我們可以瞭解，麥帥爲什麽準許日本漁船到四週外洋去捕魚。到中國海面的四十艘，不過是日本獲得准許派往外洋的千艘漁船之小量。我們也可以曉得麥帥爲什麽要派遣占領軍的國家自己以船運糧來供應駐日占領軍，而不得在糧荒的日本就地採購。我們於此可以懂得爲什麽美國報紙以及在東京的日文報紙特別以大字標出總部由美運麥粉到日本的新聞。</p>
<p>麥帥在經濟方面雖然予日本以種種補給，但今年以及今後的日本糧食問題依然是一件大事。日本人七千萬在這麼四塊島上居住，由於版土狹窄，耕地太少，總無法滿足其食的需量。所以日本在過云數十年總是以工業製品向馬來，越南，暹羅，換取米糧。朝鮮與台灣的米產更是無條件供應日本本土，現在由世界各處把日俘日僑遣回本土，糧源消失，食者衆多，日本的糧食問題總歸是今後日本最嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>麥帥的次一辦法，就是維持日本輕工業使能以多餘產品換得糧食，已開工的二百五十七萬紗錠，織布機十萬台，人造絲紡錠十三萬錠，都在爲日本換取外國食糧而努力。淸楚南美及南洋情形的，當可知這二個區域糧食可以輪出。麥帥運用日本現存的三百萬噸船舶足足可以維持日本運紗布絲出口運糧入口的需要。</p>
<p>日本人現在知道他不能自主，因爲這一次大戰，他闖禍太大，投降以後，只求能以生存，一切早年主張論調都放棄了，麥帥統治日本似乎只在取得一個美國溫順隨行者的目的，所以偏重經濟上補給戰後日本創傷，政治上使日本任何內閣執行總部決策，軍事上以象徵的做法，使日本明白反抗搗亂均屬無用，而俯首接受一切條款之實行。終結的是在心理上要使日本逐漸由渺視美國狂妄誇大日本實力，喚醒爲對美國友好，崇信。故而麥帥占領日本以後，除了爲完成心理作戰目的而拘捕日本戰犯以外，美軍不曾多捕或誤捕一個日人。美軍所予日本人印象是天眞活潑愉快，且英俊有禮，毫無侵凌平民之處。我在任何處所見日本人對美軍良善反應，均可證明這一印象之不誤。</p>
<p>這種行多義的心理作用，實際上是我們中國從戰國以來即屢有實例的原則之運用。但我們似乎因爲家務凌亂，而無暇及於門外，美國以一年靑的民族生力，反能運用古老的邀好人心法術。</p>
<p>行多義的目的何在？在今天，我們看世界不協合的排陣，總可以知道，因此，狡黠的日本人心中正在暗自歡喜。在他們生命尚可揮力時，日本另一個翻身時代總會來的，所以下層日本人是衷心服從，上層日本人則已入獄或死去，中層日本人之小部正等待一個大時代好翻身。他們的夢，依我看法，是不會成功，因爲美國人的執政專家對於珍珠港敎訓及以後三年太平洋慘敗記憶深刻，廿五年管制日本的定案，正是欲由「悠長歲月」來抹掉地球上强橫集團再起的最好辦法。廿五年後，今日暗喜的日本中層人物，皆已垂老或物化，十多歲的日本兒童受了親美敎育薰陶，廿五年後正好當權，誰也想像不出那時候四塊島嶼上的不滿一萬萬日本人，會有自動自主的力量，去反抗人口將近二萬萬（廿五年後美國人口數）的美國，何况美國除了在日本爭取友誼之外，尚普遍的取好於地球上任何一塊土地上的人們。</p>

<p>以美國審判官韋勃為首席的遠東國際法庭，實在是一幕美國心理作戰部導演的好戲。他差不多每天都在開庭，地點在舊日本陸軍省軍事法庭。六月廿一日中國代表團阮維新處長即說要陪我們去看戰犯東條等廿八人的審判。廿四日一早，錢明年副官駕車來送我們去聽審判，我在樓上悶熱空氣裏，坐了一小時，實在覺得透不過氣。退出在大門口看，美國憲兵在寂靜的守衛崗上自已撲打的嬉戲跟英國司機閑談一會。</p>
<p>十一國法官實在是「九一八」以來爲日本侵略所寃死的十一個受日本侵害的國家代表人物，（中·美·英·蘇·法·澳·加·印·荷·菲·紐西蘭。）不過因爲未來世界人類歷史鉅製得有內容，所以不好意思就那麼簡單的喊一聲「還我頭來」，而把日本戰犯的頭斫掉，所以，選派法官與檢察官，組成遠東法庭，把日本人之中應負還頭之責的東條等廿八人一次一次施以疲勞審訊。（已達五十次以上）。尤其這大熱天，遠東法庭裏每次審訊法官與戰犯，皆衣着很厚，人稠室悶，只有美國頭戴白盔的憲兵，綠眼珠射出冷光。十一位法官似乎樂此不倦，而每個到日本的占領軍人，似乎也以一暏東條眞面目爲了却一件大事。他們領到了旁聽證，就擠坐在樓上普通席或樓下貴賓席，去流汗聽聽，實在我覺得這不過是一幕心理作戰戲劇而已。</p>
<p>六月廿日傍晚，進入日本東京區，至六月廿五日淸晨離東京赴厚木機塲，我僅在東京逗留四天多點，其中還有一天去百英里外的名勝風景區熱海遊覽。實際在東京三日，我的見聞實在有限，擬分數節記述，首先得說到美國統治日本這一部份。</p>
<p>在東京與日本皇宮，遙遙相對的麥帥總部，從表面上看這是一個純軍事的司令部，其代表人物麥克阿瑟老將軍似爲一個純軍人，可且實際上，這是美國各種專家人材的集團。這些專家不出名，但實際上，麥帥每一個命令及決策都是這些專家就專門問題或其主管部門研究的成果。這些專家又不以其「尃」或「偏」的見解與王張妨礙整個美國對日統治政策，相反的，這些專家的共同綜合意見，構成了美國對日政策的內容。</p>
<p>美國給予日本投降機會，雖然爲了讓自已方面少死點人，讓日本也少死點人，但最大的因素是爭取日本這塊版圖上的人·地·物入於服從聯合國的意志範疇中。倘若打進日本，那戰後占領日本必定船塢破壞，港口破壞，交通系統破壞，以及日本人民對盟國占領的仇恨心理與仇恨行爲，那情形曾勝於日本打進中國占領中國所得的反應。所以當日本決定投降只求保全天皇制度這一點時，美國很快的就接受這一條件而担負起日本受降的工作。</p>
<p>初初進占日本的軍隊，只有美軍二十萬人，除了北海道以北的千島羣島由蘇軍先行占領外，日本四個大島上全是美軍，直到今年，英·加·澳·新西蘭·荷蘭·菲律賓等軍才以小數量出現於日本。麥帥總部規定盟軍總數量，不超過日本人口百分之零點四，即日本人二百五十名配一名盟國占領軍。實際上，現在日本本土的盟軍，不過十七萬人，其與日本人口比例數爲四百十一人與一之比，尚駐於規定的「點」內，不構成「錢」，更談不上「面」的占領。</p>
<p>當我們經過一座鐵橋時，橋頭一塊白漆紅字牌子迎着我們，那上而寫着：「現在你到了東京！」這是一句意義深長的話。這句話裏包括許多悲壯與歡喜的故事，在這句話的下面，美國人死得最多，中國人更多於美國人。我想到去年九月初聯合國軍隊由此橋頭進駐東京的光景，這句話意義就更深長！</p>
<p>看東京市區的殘牆碎渣，我們才知道四川重慶的轟炸是不足道。我們的車停於銀座有樂町帝國銀行有樂館。東京的夜晚，雖神秘的引人，我們却躱在四樓上默默的忖一忖這天的經過。</p>
<p>我想到所有飛機失事，多半是雲封大地，降落時碰到比地高而爲雲擁的山邱所致。上海雖無山地，但起飛時雲高不及三百尺，如落地甚爲危險，好在飛機是好的，東京這一目標到我機飛達時，亦可天晴，故而飛機就按照命令時間起飛，而絕不猶豫。</p>

<p>六月廿三日中國駐日軍官羅麟寶上尉以及顏志良中尉陪我以及黃爾毅，陳功懋等赴熱海溫泉作遠足，坐火車二小時半，才感覺日本交通體系是毫無破壞，且根底深厚，所經山洞有二十個之多，其中一個山洞行約五分鐘長於京滬綫鎭江山洞一倍以上。</p>
<p>熱海在東京西南百公里處的相模灣濱有富士山支脈箱根山麓。湧出的溫泉，小鎭市，依山濱海，景色絕佳，爲東京人夏季海水浴冬季溫泉浴的鄕居勝地，這小鎭市一點也沒有受到戰爭擾害，街市上的店面反比東京漂亮，但所售物件價亦甚貴，除食品及玩具日用品外無他東西，在二黑人美兵爲其日本女伴買珠串店中買畫「浮舟」一幅。</p>
<p>遊海濱浴塲，看綠舟在海上浮沉，日本男女大人小孩在水中游泳，那景象眞動人，我未帶游衣，正好做旁觀者，我覺日本人生活在海島上，日光，海水，島上淸麗風光均可培植這個民族，每一子民成爲體健的份子，倘若不做統御世界及他族的英雄夢，別國自願與之合作供以所缺糧食，這個島上民族專去工藝方面發展不難成爲古希臘民族在東方的今影。</p>
<p>在平安間中華旅店進餐，登四樓看熱海灣全景，聽薄暮潮聲拍岸，想到這次奇妙旅行機會若不是周至柔將軍筆下批准，也不曾得有，數日之旅行雖屬匆匆，但日本風物總是唇樓浮光似的在我眼前呈現過了，倘若以後有機會，這國度我到願常住。</p>
<p>晚九時與陳功懋兄等乘最後一班火車返東京市，所坐不是絲絨盟軍專車而係裝滿貨物的壓尾火軍，其中有數十籍小鷄啾啁叫鳴，引起一個年老美國兵家念頭，他說：</p>
<p>「我眞想在我的家里養上這麼一羣小鷄可是還要我五個月我才能回去，這規定可眞叫我憂鬱」</p>
<p>我們吿訴他，我們也想回到家鄕養小鷄，而不願在外面做一個外國兵，但我們對於即將歸航的事實守密未吿他，怕他爲此又把袋中的酒瓶解出倒灌。</p>

<h3 id="c150">星期論壇　論所謂「金融風潮」 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 謝康沙</p>
<p>兼旬以來，上海市塲初則公債狂跌，幾家投機字號倒閉，若干投機朋友避走，牽連着幾家銀行的職員；繼之以大亞銀行的淸理，同時適值「六底」決算，及大宗捲烟稅款解入國庫，一部份頭寸關住，以致銀根抽緊。月初開關以後，局勢如故。少數行莊，爲了交換差額未能儘早補足，舒齊較晏，於是引起許多謠諑。報紙採訪，從而張大其詞，刋載某行某莊停業擱淺等等消息，以致人心惶惶，相驚伯有，其實，行莊每日票據交換，其差額非多即缺，原屬平淡無奇。而在缺乏聯合準備機構的今日，臨時缺單者自須四出張羅，尤其在大家緊縮拆放之時，此亦無足驚異。若遽因此認爲整個金融業發生「風潮」，未免言過其實。這情形正如前些時廣西路出現一條四尺長的靑蛇，報上就故意渲染說是「巨蟒出現，」一樣滑稽可笑！</p>
<p>固然，在最近兩旬中，一部份投機家所受的打擊，不可謂不慘重。但初與整個金融業無關。因爲大家早都知道黑市塲的公債交易，軼出常軌，一般金融業和穩健的投機份子，已經視同蛇蝎，不加聞問，絕不比戰前華商證券交易所時代，祇要公債連跌幾板，就會震撼整個市面。目下可說公債與金融業幾無痛癢關係。個中操縱之從·先則揑造關金還木，把百元票而抬高至二千元以上，當時政府已有閑謠；而他們依然再進一步，虛虧「孫票」還本之說，甚至謂萬元票面可換黃金十兩，硬把市價抬高至八千多元。本來此等毫無常識的調言，除掉利令智昏的湖塗朋友，以及坐待宰割的羔羊以外，還有誰去上當？所以今番市價大跌特特跌，投機份子的虧損數目雖相當可驚，但受影響的範圍究不廣大。不過他們用慣詐欺方法，從多方面騙取股票現金，彌補他們的折閱，東扯西牽，連累多人。復因公債下跌，他們從而斬割股票，以資挹注，於是股票市價也跟着一落千丈。此時受押的債權人，紛紛催贖，收縮貼放，以致股市愈盤愈小，投機市塲銀根也愈縮愈緊。一連串行莊職員的舞弊案件，於焉暴露。結果，迫倒了大亞銀行，而風聲所播，市面遂不免於動盪。</p>
<p>事實吿訴我們，半年來上海投機家運用的資金，完全來自投機市場。因爲銀錢業存息薄，外面暗息高，不少有錢朋友，都把款項直接間接在市塲拆放，坐收利息。所以投機市塲的波動，與金融業根木不發生連繫。但是最後的結果，也終不免於牽累，這理由很簡單。原來市面是整個的，無法分離，「牽一髮而動全身，」便應了這句話。不過就上海整個金融業而論，他們飽經憂患，閱盡滄桑，憑着他們悠久的歷史和經騐，應付這些小小的浪花，根本並不當一回事。若干報紙雖在渲染金融緊張情形，但在銀錢兩業公會裏，始終靜悄悄地，辦事人也都悠閑自得，可窺所謂「風潮」的真相了。</p>
<p>中國人的處世秘訣，是「各人自掃門前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜。」此在昔日經濟組織簡單的時代，固可獨善其身，但在經濟組織錯綜複雜的今日，金融業若再墨守成規，隔岸觀火，最後恐非延燒到自身不止。最近行莊大家收縮信用，不做拆放，當日支票不予抵用，這在營業方針上，原是值得稱頌的。但甲家如此，乙家效尤，丙丁更從而取法，結果則交換所退票一退一兩百億·以致引起許多無謂的謠諑。這種措置，似乎值得加以研究。</p>
<p>在金融動盪時期，最要緊是安定人心，根絕浮言。否則無稽謠諑，愈傳愈廣，存戶心理，發生恐慌，紛紛擠提，此時應付一不得當，便眞會闖下大禍。金融業原以受信授信爲主要業務，但任何行莊放款，非一時三刻所得收回，而目下存款則百分之九十五屬於浮存性質，不難於半日之間，全數提光。縱使平時信用如何好，準備如何充實的行莊，到此也將束手無策了。昔年美國金融恐慌期間，有一家著名銀行，屹立不搖，但是某一天，因行內時鐘欠準確，早晨開啓大門遲幾分鐘，便立刻展開了閉門停業的謠諑。一傳十，十傳百，等到大門一開，湧進了無數存戶，頃刻之間，現款立被提盡，無法週轉，就此逼倒。這眞是無妄之災，但也可見市面動盪中，謠言對民衆心理影響的重大了。所以各家行莊堅壁淸野，其實也不是最好的辦法。</p>
<p>不但如此，目下上海經濟病態，已經一天深刻一天。工廠因成本昂貴，出品不能與洋貨競爭，奄奄一息。商店因開支浩大，生意淸淡，坐吃山空。而利息負擔之重，尤爲各業的致命傷。今後工商業若不趕快打開一條新出路，前途自是可危。那是金融業的處境，恐怕要比今番債市暴落所形成的後果，更要嚴重十百倍。「履籍堅冰至」，深願全市金融業，趁早凖備。</p>
<p>勝利已近一年，而上海金融業尚缺乏保持集體安全的機構，實在是一大遺憾。安定市面，固然是金融業的義務，可也是財政富局和國家銀行應盡的職責。若一味只知緊縮，不管輕重緩急，而存款準備金的規定，太趨呆板，形同凍結，以及中央銀行必要時還未能盡力扶助同業，多少不免貽人以相當口實。我們切望在財政當局和中央銀行全力支持之下，早日成立銀錢業聯合準備會，使金融業可以集中力量，集中資金，掮起同業間的盈濟虛的担子，保持集體安全，以應付未來可能的困難。</p>

<p>編者：勝利後的今天，給我們同學，帶來了很可怕的事實，學生沒有書可讀，生活日高，父母沒有力量來負擔，敎師領不到薪水，如此事實，只好陷於停頓。勝利後給國民帶來了些飢餓與盜匪，北平是文化城，而盜匪之多，實出於生活壓迫。勝利後的物價確是驚人，重大的生活擔子，國民眞有負不起之槪，有許多人死於生活綫上！（張宏文自北平寄）</p>

<p>主筆先生：</p>
<p>七七抗戰軍興，我帶着老婆孩子逃到了大後方，沿途經過了種種艱難困苦的生活。隨着勝利，我返回了故鄕，房屋是焚燒了，田園是荒蕪了，一切的一切都完了。好容易東湊西凑借了幾萬塊錢，在鄕鎭上做點小生意，收入不多，但還能勉强維持目前的生活，我也就滿足了。那知沒過幾天，來了個掛盒子砲的先生，說是調査戶口，問這問那，閙個不休，結果，笑迷迷地走了，接著某委員來了，調查戶口，編製保甲，拿着調査費，手續費，登記費走了。警察所編製門牌號數要編製費。鄉保隊要經費（陷區人民還得付開辦費，歷年來的經常費，眞正豈有此理）稅局老爺要開徵營業稅，貨物稅，印花稅，房舖捐，地皮捐（陷區商人要補繳勝利以前的捐稅，稅務局長爲外省人，走動起來後面跟着許多背槍的人十足威風）經過商會長折衝（據說這裏很有妙頭）由商會一手包辦，供獻了一個巨大的豐字完事。政府爲保衛人民安全，充實自衛力量，攤派槍枝費，以十萬火急的命令，星夜催收，刻不容緩。但是，直到現在，某保長移交時還私人虧欠槍技費若干萬元，也不了了之。這大約因為他，辛辛苦苦做了幾個月保長，對上是不無微功吧？某科長某主任以（童叟無欺，價不二價）的香烟由商會攤派，其他還有什麽歡迎費，慰勞費……等名目繁多，不遑枚舉。在這種種剝削下，我又離開了家鄉，恢復了流浪的生活。我將怎麽辦？先生：（黃馥上）</p>

<p>貴報讀者意見欄內，載有黃春福先生「寄材所一再漲價」之稿，與事實不符。査敝所普通間寄柩費每年二萬六千元，幷無增至三萬八千餘元之事。而出堂費一萬元亦無衛生捐手續費等名目，竟謂藉口需索十餘萬元之鉅，殊深驚異。况寄柩出堂等費，均有定例，何能濫收？黃春福先生可即來敝事務處一談，以便澄清與案之人。。（普安寄柩所謹啓）。</p>

<h3 id="c158">讀書偶感 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>一個細眉小眼的青年，讀了一篇動人的小說，笑着告訴人家說：「啊！我飲了一杯美酒！」唸了一篇沖淡的散文，笑着告訴人家說：「啊！我喝了一碗清茶！」看了一篇嚴正的論文，笑着告訴人家說：「啊！我吃了一盅良藥啊！」</p>
<p>這個青年真可說一聲出類拔萃了，因為一般現象總是如此：道學先生看不起小說，罵牠誨盜誨淫，傷風敗俗。年輕人憎厭枯澀無味的論文，說牠像催眠符，像頭痛靈。喜愛形樸意深一類冲淡文章的人，又嫌濃　雕琢的文字近乎浪費，千篇一律的論說過於呆板。</p>
<p>其實世間任何事情，不能够一棒打盡。誨盜誨淫的小說固然很多，但有價值的小說，其教人感人的力量，要超過道學先生的洋洋偉論萬倍以上。濃　雕琢的文字有許多確乎是浪費，然而一首形質俱美的小詩，我們不能否認牠的可愛與偉大。至於嚴正的說教，固然使人頭痛，可是所謂「良藥苦口」；何况近代的「良藥」，已逐漸改良，有的包着糖衣，有的滲入了甜香的糖汗，不一定「苦口」的呢！</p>
<p>常有人把書本稱作精神的「糧食」，我覺得這非常確當。一個人能「魚肉青菜，樣樣都愛」，實在是一件有益的事。</p>
<h3 id="c159">小清　（小說） <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>頻年飄泊，歲月在孤寂裏空過，而今雖不是白髪蒼蒼，但風塵交　，綺年煥發的光澤，已不免有點倦老之色了，為了與渾濁浮虛能隔離，我常以童稚的純真，和兒時的任性坦率，來當作我生活下去的勇氣。</p>
<p>每當我和孩子們接近的時候，他們的言笑跳動，就好像是我內心蘊積的情感，全般傾瀉了出來，做成了一個有生命的活動模型一樣；這就是使我熱愛他們，並且很易成了他們的小同伴的緣故。</p>
<p>小清是我朋友的姪女，深黑濃密的頭髪，兩隻發亮的眸子，很靈活穎慧的轉動着，使人一眼看去，覺得她是六七歲的小姑娘了，其實她今年只有四歲，因為她不同我們住在一起，便常跟她的祖母到我們這裏來玩。</p>
<p>當我最初遇見她時，她陌生地望着我。因為我剛從南方來不久，是寄住在朋友家裏；她知道這屋子裏，從來沒有看見過像我的人，她有點疑異怯生。我的朋友對她說：「小清，這個也是叔叔，你叫他叔叔好了。」</p>
<p>她沒有叫我只是站着，但疑異的樣子已經減退了，我用南方的普通話和她招呼，她不懂，老是「呃，呃，」着，她看見在旁她的叔叔笑起來，她也笑了，我才學着生硬的上海話和她說：「剛才我說的話，你不懂喲？」</p>
<p>「勿懂！勿懂！」</p>
<p>「我是剛從美國回來的，我說的是美國話，怪得你不懂，」我故意騙她。</p>
<p>「你真會騙人，啥美國話喲，哪！好像Halloo，yes，Halloo，yes，你都不懂得講啦！」她关起來；不一刻又認真地老是連續唸着Halloo，yes……搖着頭靠近我。</p>
<p>「小清，真的，他那裏懂得美國話，他剛才說的倒是印度話的，你看他臉孔黑黑的，他是印度人，剛從印度來的，你叫他做阿三亞叔好了，」我的朋友打趣說</p>
<p>「啊！阿三亞叔！」她很有興　的重復地叫着，不少新鮮的快感在她嘴唇邊，流露出來，從此，小清便叫我做阿三亞叔了，這是我認識小清的情形，我們也立即便混熟起來了。</p>
<p>「小清，你唸過書了嗎？」我問她。</p>
<p>「唸的，我跟小姑娘唸，晚上我們都讀書。」</p>
<p>她跑到書櫃邊，從箱子裏抽了幾本小朋友雜誌出來，用手捧着，翻開了一本，坐在我旁邊的矮凳子上，便嗶啦嗶啦的讀起來。其實她是不懂的，只是似唱似哼般學着唸書的樣子糊亂地叫！看她搖頭擺腦的神氣，我不禁嗤聲笑出來。</p>
<p>「小清，你唸得倒真快，我不大聽得清你唸什麼，」我裝正經地問她。</p>
<p>「噓！你懂得什麼，」說後，她很快走去拿了一本英文書來，翻開書攤在膝上，重重贅贅地唸着：「A，H，B；A，H，B，」唸了一節又望望我。</p>
<p>「誰人教你唸這些的？」</p>
<p>「我二叔叔，三叔叔都教我，」她很高興。</p>
<p>「你不懂，你不懂，先生會打你的！」她突然站起來，兩隻小手臂圍牢我的頭，嘴吧貼緊我的耳邊，絮絮地說；脚踏上了椅子，便騎上了我的肩上。我不知為了什麼，學着她剛才唸「A，H，B，A，H，B，」大叫起來；我恍惚般投在夢一樣的原始稚氣裏了。</p>
<p>「你為什麼不叫小姑姑來玩？」有一天我問她</p>
<p>「她怕羞，我叫她不來。」她想了一想，又接住呶起嘴吧說</p>
<p>「怕什麼事，她比我大啦，見人反不敢說話；大人都是這樣子，我真討厭她們！」</p>
<p>我因為要寫一封信，不同她談了，也不去管她。當我寫好了信，回頭一望，原來小清站在小凳子上，伏靠在梳裝案檯，拿梳子撥滿髪油，正在對着鏡子梳頭，臉上兩頰塗着幾堆不勻整的雪花蕊，我不覺笑起來問她：</p>
<p>「小清，你幹什麼？」</p>
<p>「梳頭。」這時她才稍顯得有點羞意，低聲說。</p>
<p>我替她弄好，她安安服服地瞧着她鏡裏的樣子，現着會心的微笑。像一個小天使，她美麗玲琍得多了。這小小的心靈已懂得裝扮，懂得美所產生的快慰。我自己這樣想着，這不是人初的良知嗎？</p>
<p>有一些時候，當她看見我發呆時，便責罵似的對我說：</p>
<p>「你真是個獃子！」接着她便嘮嘮叨叨的告訴我怎樣玩啦唱啦，好半天沒有停止……</p>
<p>有一次她在我的書桌上，翻見了幾個信封，便要我給她一張信紙，說要寫信給她的小姑姑。我給了她一張紙後，她拿起墨筆，便歪歪曲曲地畫了許多綫條，一直畫個滿紙，沒有寫上一個字</p>
<p>「你寫好哪？寫些什麼？唸唸給我聽。」我入神地望着她那可愛的樣子。</p>
<p>「我是這樣寫：小姑姑，伯伯來上海了，叫他買幾本書給我。」她嘖嘖地點點頭唸了這兩句，再像提醒了我說：</p>
<p>「哪，我還寫了，要買一個洋娃娃。」她指指最後一行的綫條，便摺起來，放進信封裏。</p>
<p>雖然看她寫的不是字，我不笑她；我以為她的虛託文字，我不笑她；我以為她的虛託文字，遇到重復唸時，會有前後不相副的錯誤，所以叫她再拿出信重唸一遍，可是她還照樣的能够唸出剛才所說的話，絲毫沒有錯誤。</p>
<p>這是神奇的綫條，編織成了天真純潔的意象喲！我深深地感動，反看見自己寫了滿紙虛無的東西，覺得年長與世故蒙騙的可恥與悲哀！</p>
<p>已經有一星期多了。小清沒有到我們這裏來玩。她前次寫下的信，沒有拿去，我重展開來看；我希望用這天真純潔的綫綱，能編織成人間永遠燦爛純真的童心。</p>

<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>旅長乾爸爸跑過來一把拉住了麗華的手，喞咕地又說：</p>
<p>「傻孩子，乾爸爸自然讓你媽一起來呀！乾爸爸給你們娘倆買一幢房子；派馬弁服伺你，無論吃，穿；都由乾爸爸負擔。」</p>
<p>麗華知道不妙了，連忙站起來說：</p>
<p>「我該上園子去了。乾爸爸！」</p>
<p>但是，旅長乾爸爸像老　抓雛鷄似的把她抱到了懷裏，囁嚅地笑着說：</p>
<p>「還早，我的乖！以後不要再唱戲了吧，瞧唱戲多苦！乾爸爸有的是錢，乾爸爸讓你好好享享福，養得像乾爸爸一樣胖！說着摸了摸麗華的脊梁。「曖喲！身子都瘦成一把骨頭了，我的寶貝！快別幹這行了，明兒就跟你媽去講，你媽也一定樂意的。」旅長乾爸爸說罷，滿滿喝了一杯酒，又挾了一筷子菜，直往麗華嘴喂。「吃呀！心肝！」</p>
<p>「乾爸爸放我下來，乾爸爸放我下來！」麗華扭過頭去，掙扎着想撐出旅長乾爸爸的懷抱。</p>
<p>「別鬧，乖乖地坐在乾爸爸身上！乾爸爸疼你！」紳士乾爸爸低聲說。緊緊摟着麗華不放，並且把有鬚鬚的唇湊了過去要親麗華。</p>
<p>五年前的一幕，又閃到麗華的腦海，她像當年抗拒張弦那樣，用力抗拒着旅長乾爸爸。　感到更儼重的恐怖！她一面躱避一面嚷着：</p>
<p>「放我！乾爸爸！放我呀！」</p>
<p>旅長乾爸爸似乎沒有聽見，輕輕搬過了麗華的臉，用酒氣醺醺的嘴，吻着麗華的嘴。使麗華再嚷不出聲來，使麗華陷於　息；使麗華幾乎昏厥！</p>
<p>正在這萬分危險的時候，一聲霹雷震驚了旅長乾爸爸——房門驀地開了，走進一個有着獅子威風的女人，旅長乾爸爸一抬頭，「批批拍拍」，迎上幾掌耳光，他狼狽地連忙放下懷裏的麗華，一溜烟鼠竄而逃。</p>
<p>這時，麗華還沒有恢復神智，猛不防兩頰也飛來了「批拍」之聲！</p>

<p>— 謝紫</p>
<p>今天因為沒有睡午覺，母親叫我同房來歇一會，可是我真的不想睡，我覺得把這種幽靜幸福的日子在睡夢裏消磨是太可惜的，這種幸福的日子，轉眼就會變成陳跡，而我的童年確已經變成陳跡了，我該到那兒去找尋呢？</p>
<p>我輕輕的掩好了房門，就沿着那青色的籬笆走去，今天風真大，滿院落葉在秋風裏飄舞，我閉起了雙目，在那舊日跑熟的小道上迎風前進，我覺得彷彿重新回到了舊日的生活，這兒的一切都那麼熟習：小木門在呀呀轉動的聲音；樹葉從枝頭吹落，擦過籬笆的聲音；以及一羣羣小鳥在風裏抖翅而飛的聲音。</p>
<p>我偶然睜開眼睛，我到好幾叢聚在一起的銀絲菊，開得那麼明艷，因為我們不喜歡黃色的菊花，所以這兒都是紫色和白色的，籬笆已經給風吹壞了，整個菊畦也顯得有點兒荒蕪，菊畦畔有一濕曲折的溪水，溪的彼岸是一所茅亭，在這秋風落葉的時節，一切都染有秋的氣息。</p>
<p>記得初次離家的時候，我曾在這兒盡情的哭泣過，後來聽到母親喚我，才匆匆的拭乾了眼淚，可是我不敢直接走到母親身邊，就僅在窗口躇躊着，母親問我話我也隔着窗子應答，這時有幾隻燕子在樑上呢喃，我覺得自己的聲音也像燕子一樣的呢喃不清，不過燕子是歡喜的，而我却帶着哭泣的心情，這種心情，也許至今還沒有完全消泯吧！然而我是回到家了。</p>
<p>——家，這正是我兩年以來所懷念的，也是我在無數個相同的夢裏所獨自找尋的，兩年，不能算一個很長的時期，可是我這次回家來，大家都說我變了，母親告訴我，我比從前瘦了些，孩子氣少了些，並且在我的神情上看到一點她所不希望看到的憂鬰的樣子，我說也許是我太想家的緣故，母氣又絮絮的問我，這兩年裏有沒有碰到什麼不如意的事；離開了家是否有一種無依的感覺，這次在旅途上有沒有什麼意外的驚駭和勞悴，她一面撫摸着我的手，一面笑着問我，為什麼老是眼淚汪汪的，到底還脫不掉小孩子脾氣，於是我索興伏在母親懷裏痛哭了，我並沒有碰到什麼不如意的事，可是母親，經過兩年多的睽隔，我才更深的體會到家庭所給我的溫暖，才更深的體會到母親對我的情意，真是刻骨銘心啊！</p>
<p>這次改變的不只是我，整個家庭都有點改變了，哥哥已經完全是一個大人，母親如雲的鬢髪上也添了不少銀絲，就是我所夢想的小園，也已無復昔日的景象了，我站在零亂的菊畦畔，遠處是一片烟霧迷濛的景象，太陽已現出了後天的蒼白，我沿着小溪走去，一直走到茅亭的石堦上，我就坐在那兒，眼望着悠悠的溪水，我想從溪水中看一看，我到底有什麼改變，可是溪水老在洸漾不停，使我看不清自己的影兒，慢慢的，我已忘掉了自己的初衷，我的眼睛，追隨着一片落葉，飄到遠遠的地方去。</p>
<p>突然我心裏又浮起了一片往日的印象，那情境幾乎與現在完全相同，而當時的心緒却是怎樣的不同啊！那時候我和母親和哥哥一起坐在亭子裏，不知怎樣母親忽然想起來問我們將來的志願，哥哥說他希望走遍全世界，在經歷一番事業以後，再回到家園來孝敬母親，我說我沒有這麼大約願望，只要能常和母親在一起，就覺得非常幸福了，後來我們作一種試騐，每人採一朶花，丟在溪水中，誰得一朶飄得遠，就表示誰將來要渡一種飄泊的生涯，結果我的一朶剛剛丟下去，就給溪草絆住了，哥哥的一朶，却一直飄到溪的盡頭，我們都高興得拍起手來，彷彿來日的命運已在這兒注定了似的，可是就事實講，這幾年來，哥哥一直在家園左近，而我却離開母親有一千多里之遠，將來的歲月又將如何，那真是一個莫可捉摸的謎呢！</p>
<p>可是回到了家，到底一切都穩定了，我們從悲歡離合的動盡的生活，回到了攸閑朴素的生活，從熱情回到了溫情，就是這荒蕪的園子，也有種親切的鄉土味，你看那邊榆樹上的幾隻鳥巢，還依然如昔，那斷垣殘瓦上的麻雀也依然在歡歡喜喜的唱歌，這一切象徵着多麼寧靜，又多麼滿足！讓我也和它們一樣的快樂吧！我們現在已經團圓了，不管是現實，還是夢寐，我們已得到了我們所憧憬的，讓我們踏着輕快的步子，去尋覓我們的幸福吧！</p>
<p>這樣，我抱着滿懷新生的希望，背着夕陽，向我的家屋跑去！</p>

<p>— 齊梵</p>
<p>沒有了家鄉，我不悲傷，我知道不久將有一天我能够高興地踏着那些土地，尋找我幼年留下的脚印——蓋上了一層血，也蓋上了一層光榮。</p>
<p>彷彿是一個中古的夢，我的眼前廻繞着一行頹廢的城堞。對着這歷史上用為攻擊和防禦而今已成為廢物的建築，不禁唏噓。　　在烽火連天的當年，我離開了這使人留戀的地方；如今，勝利了，在一個偶然的機緣裏，我開始作了一次故鄉之行，雖然是那麼一個短促的時間，但在時光的急流中，我覺得我們村上的人，在這次極大劇變中，是够受了。從陰霾中，我看到春色的雲天；在沙漠中，我看到芳草與綠洲，那是一個夢，不曾留下在記憶，而僅是那麼一個疤痕，一方火刻的烙印，那是雪地上的脚印——給時間遺留與時間。</p>
<p>刼後的老家，在其中曾消磨了我一些生命的開始的歲月的屋子。曲折的廊廡上面盤繞着古雅的窗??，逗留着往日的綺麗，而也不免跌落昏昏的蛛絲。窗??外，一片綠色的稻田，　確的山石，和那一片滾滾江流。</p>
<p>那金黃的斜陽，塗上破廢的窗??，塗上城堞，塗上江面。黃昏剛在打扮的時候，可以傾聽着遠遠行來的牧童的笛音，清脆而又深邃，是無限醉人的生命力的獨奏。牧童經過門前，跳下來，把穿在牛鼻子上的繩子，扣在旁邊的樹根上，會向我輕輕地說聲「晚安」，注射着深刻的眼睛。</p>
<p>遠處，幾間染着帶有濃重原始味的茅屋，人生的全部曲調都在這兒彈奏着，是那麼樸素·輕鬆。</p>
<p>夜晚，藍鋼似的蔚林，向夜空披着喜悅，江水流向遙遠的天邊。</p>
<p>在月光下，我抖擻一下，那幾年來梗鬰在心腔內的氣塊，慢慢地在溶化。</p>
<p>我的心，顯然被照透了。</p>
<h3 id="c163">供花 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 宋夢芹</p>
<p>近年來，我的花瓶常是空着的。</p>
<p>房間裏沒有了綺麗的春容，也沒有了清泠的秋色，生在那裏，如果沒有強烈的寒暑的刺激，我將永遠混混然不知冬夏。朋友們都說留連在這房間裏可以忘年。然而這枯寂，這空虛，這少生氣，有誰知道是並非得已？</p>
<p>我是最愛花的，折枝的花兒北地不多見，小時候生活在北方城市，只有偷向家園裏折幾枝玉蘭或菊或梅供在瓶裏，偶然若被父親注意到，總是罵我是自私的孩子。</p>
<p>南來後，第一個好感闖進我的印像的就是街港中四時不斷的賣花聲，那不但减少我偷折園花的責罵，更從那清甜和婉的聲調中，給予我無限的幽閒的美感。我無一天不早起，無一天不去偷偷開了邊門去買幾東來，加意的供在瓶裏，這工作常會犧牲了整個的早晨。</p>
<p>一天天，一月月，一年年過去，真奇怪，供花並沒有給我什麼美感的安慰，却只層層的纍起了懷疑的癥結。我不知道是北地花兒容易供，還是童年供花技巧勝過現在？這變化究竟在花呢，還是在於供花人？為什麼天天供花天天不能滿意的？</p>
<p>經騐是這樣的：屋角高几上的一瓶，比較容易滿意，你只須參差錯落的綴上幾枝，總不失一種清幽恬靜的真趣。臨壁案頭的一瓶，你只要顧全了三面的美點，也還容易差強人意。只有房中間檯子上的一瓶啊！幾年來沒有一次可能滿意。你插好了前面，後面必有疏漏；注意左面，準會發現右面的不勻調；縱然你四面都能勉強成功了，而當你站在檯子前偶一向下俯視，那一種零亂不雅的形容，會給你最大的失望的。</p>
<p>我為了這，曾砸過花瓶，曾罵過聽差，也曾揉碎過鮮嫩的花枝</p>
<p>記得朋友笑着安慰我：「這又何苦！你只要把向着房門的一面加意綴飾一下，使才進門的人們，迎頭光有了好感，先入為主，在他們心上自然　起的成見中，將感覺到無處不美了，何必太過求全？」</p>
<p>哥哥勸兒：「你只要把你常坐的一隻沙發的對面，插得藝術些就是了，只有自己才是真正能够了解自己的人。何必為了其餘去認真！」</p>
<p>父親笑着說：「這孩子的確有幾分　！我問你，天下事可有萬全的嗎？縱然有，那依然有着萬全的限止，而一萬零一呢？」父親說着拍了拍我的肩頭，我也含着莫名的微笑。</p>
<p>從一片疑思躊躇下我的花瓶空着很久了，我每看見牠，一種哀惋惶惶的心情使我茫然。</p>
<h3 id="c164">演技中的形式派 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 葉子</p>
<p>這派的演劇以梅耶荷德為代表，他反對心理劇塲而揭　了新美學和新倫理的名義，他是自然主義的寃家，不願把現實的人生再現出來，他創造一個特殊的舞台世界，把現代生活的氛圍集中而凝鍊之藉助於磨練的形式技巧而努力因此他所獲的地位，是和莫斯科藝術劇塲明顯的對立着。他本來是這個劇塲最初的集團中之一員，而且和它工作了四年之久。但後來他發覺這劇院與他的理想不合，因徹底不滿意其所用的方法而脫離。他覺得史母坦尼的自然主義表現方式束縛舞台的表現，而且不能從觀衆身上得到反應，他以為戲劇表現的職務，在於表現達傳給觀衆。</p>
<p>在他的劇塲裏是以導演為中心的，可以說整個的演出物，為梅耶荷德的堅強而富有詩意的人格所統轄着，所以他自稱為「演出物的作者」，為了表現這個人格，他負起完全的責任來表現他的觀念，他用他自己的特殊的角度來觀察人生，劇作者演員，舞台佈景，用具佈置，導具，燈光和色彩，所有這些只是供他表現他的觀念而已。他領導着他們，用確切不移的手來指引他們。所以梅耶荷德曾經說過：「藝術上最貴重的是藝術家用自己的精神造成的作品。藝術作品的內容便是藝術家的精神。舞台上的演員就如同擺在彫刻家面前的粘土，也必須像彫刻家一樣，將內容——自己的精神的發作及其感覺，以明朗的形式使它具象化。對於……演員，必須將他的精神如同在觀衆面前說明一樣予以助力——這就是「演劇的唯一使命」。梅耶荷德對於演劇不是現實的，積極反映，而是自己表現的形式，所謂客觀的世界，不過是本質上不同的創作吧了。</p>
<p>梅耶荷德早就感到，戲劇藝術務須是獨立的，而且編演人要有自由演釋劇本的權利。這使他走向更大胆的結論去了。因此他認為劇本裏所作的各種改變，是不可避免的，而且是合法的。並且在十月革命時期，因為缺乏適合的劇目，他決心要創造一些出來。他依據戲劇史，劇塲是有它們自己的編劇家的，於是他自己便担任了那缺席的劇作家的職務。</p>
<p>在演出方面的基本藝術手法，他提出了條件性的原則，這是作為反自然主義的戰鬥武器，他厭惡自然主義現象之再現，他認為那是粗雜醜惡的。所以他在「演劇論集」中曾說：觀衆在劇埸「不是來看實生活的，是來看人類的藝術的，然而在舞台上自身的反復，怎能叫藝術呢？觀衆是渴望着虛構和演技的，光是給以自身的反復，只是實生活或是奴隸的模擬」。他為反對藝術劇埸內部的技巧，對於外部技巧特別注意。他說任何藝術都是有條件性的，演劇的目的和其他一切藝術一樣，不是某種一定的世界觀的生活反映，而是作者，演出者，演員的人生觀的解明，所以他說，「形象的明確性決沒有當它是描寫嚴格的必要，靜止的演劇技術是姿態的簡潔和動作的節約重要過全部姿態的。</p>
<p>因此他便提出程式化樣式化的創造方法。他認為自然主義的處理的方法太複雜太過詳細自然主義的目的表現真正的人生，而隱蔽了生活的內在精神，他只表現了事物的現象而隱藏了在事物背後的活動。他的意見以為戲劇的演出應當顯示活動或精神，為了這個目的，他應該是單純的，極端的集中及簡約，而不應過於詳細，分散及冗贅，如果想成功完美的精神傳達的話，便企圖以精神或活動放在舞台上，代替事物或真實生活，這需要將實生活上的細部和歷史細部徹底的排除，求時代和現象之最大限度的普遍化，將隱蔽着的特徵用一切表現手段曝露出來，求其鮮明內面的意義。此種精神或活動，是演出者為了戲劇傳達而抽取的一切精華造成了良好的樣式。良好的樣式在舞台上能把一切屬於真實世界的事物，同樣屬於精神及心靈。了解這一點便能够用象徵與暗示的方法傳達重要的經騐。他規限一切表現的物體和介體，而用這些物體去解釋。因此條件性，普遍化，象徵的思想是和樣式化的槪念不可分的相連結着的。</p>
<p>梅耶荷德一生都在尋求戲劇傳達的真正方式，他不斷的探求那些接近劇本構造的新方法，及企圖把劇塲劇塲化，把戲劇戲劇化。極注力於從劇本下抽取戲劇的精華，竭其方法之可能，圓滿的把牠傳達給觀衆。如果我們細察其工作途程的進展，便知道那完全根據在尋求統一的象徵，以傳達戲劇表現之最高方式的探討上。他始終如一的問題便是如何提高劇塲裏了解力的水準，使劇本重要的意義，能傳達得毫無遺失。他常說：「一個戲的演出，有兩件事最重要，第一，我們要探討作者的思想，然後我們要以戲劇形式表達這思想，這種形式，我們稱之為「戲劇中心」，我們便圍繞這中心，來建立演出。</p>
<p>但是演劇的計劃和企圖，是演出家的工作，以他個人為出發，實踐對於藝術主觀的觀念。演員是實行家，是沒有靈魂的傀儡。演員不是形象的創造者，活形象機械的實行家。拔去了演員的精神，建立演出者創作的獨裁。因此談到演員的表現是不能和他的理論與實踐分開的。根據條件性的原則，把戲劇戲劇化，開始他便祈求把觀衆與演員打成一片，要求舞台為觀衆神秘的聯結，給觀衆以最高的戲劇演出傳達。因此他在實騐期內便叫演員在淺舞台上，直接對觀衆表演，心中時刻想着他是在劇塲中。觀衆看戲，心中也是這樣想着。演員須從舞台上排除一切實生活，盡可能的將技術簡單化，觀衆以自己的想像力將舞台所給予的暗示，繼然是少數的也好，把它創造的完成。演員與其演得過火，倒不如不够，以其說不必要的話，倒不如少說為妙，觀衆必須將所暗示的東西用自己的語言來補足。用時他又發展應用於戲劇方式的音樂理想，他把演員的動作與音樂相配合，創造了動作的造型性。（未完）</p>

<p>當這次大戰棉延着的時候，好萊塢每一個影片公司為了要適應環境起見；就不斷地攝製着許許多多含有宣傳性意味的戰事片和實地攝製的新聞紀錄片。在銀幕上充滿着火藥味，充滿着鬥爭的鏡頭。他們的用意是要使得他們本國的人民知道祖國的兵士是如何地奮勇，而為國服務，犧牲。以喚起全國民衆，一致起來抵抗敵人！大而言之，使全球人士知道美國在這次大戰中之人力，物力貢獻的偉大。如前述的影片，勝利後在上海放映過已不少了。如：「孤城虎將」，「戰鬥夫人」，「飛虎隊」，「熱血忠魂」，「青史名標」等。</p>
<p>假定以「孤城虎將」是一枝有力的陸軍。而「戰鬥夫人」就是一艘巨型航空母艦的別號，那麼「飛虎隊」呢，是名震全球，尤屢建奇功於遠東戰線的空軍，中國人所最熟悉的。這裏面海陸空軍全包含着了！</p>
<h3 id="c166">美國人看中國農民 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 陶熊</p>
<p>在「中華萬歲」裏</p>
<p>在「中華萬歲」中，我們可以看到，有好幾個鏡頭是不合中國情理的，這就是美國人對我們的瞭解程度還不够；至少是這片的劇作者和它的導演對中國不熟悉。</p>
<p>在片中有這樣的一段戲：父親把着犂，母親牽着牛，這一對老夫妻正在土地里耕田；他們的女兒——一個衣履摩登的女學生，從汽車里下來，奔向前去高呼爸爸和媽媽。</p>
<p>我們中國是一個農業國家，全國的人民有百分之九十是農民；佔絕對大多數的農民是耕着小地主們的田地，收獲的百分之五十將繳給地主；這少數的收藏中，還將繳掉捐稅和鄉村中的公共費用，所剩餘的榖物真是少數中的少數了。一個佃農能够做二十畝田是絕無僅有的事，大多數都是做十多畝田的人，靠這十多畝田的少數收藏，要養活一個家已經是無法維持了，那兒還能去供給兒女讀書呢？</p>
<p>生活比較優裕一點的自耕農，大多都是耕着三十畝左右的田地；要是家中沒有帮手，在農忙的時候還得僱短工。他們的生活雖然比佃農的寬裕，但他們決無餘錢去供給一個女兒念大學的。在我們農村中的家長們，大多認為女兒是別人家的人，決不會把大量的金錢去供給一個女兒讀書的。就是男孩子，最多也不過念三五年小學校罷了，否則，中國還會有百分之九十以上的文盲嗎</p>
<p>小地主們的生活大多是靠着榨取佃農，假使他們有着一二百畝田，那麼，就有十個佃農在為他們流着血汗供養着他們。雖然他們有錢來供給兒女們讀書，但也不會使他們的兒女受中等以上的教育。他們認為能够記賬寫信已經够了，何必一定要中學大學畢業呢？反正做官不是靠學問的，是靠人事的。假使父母的頭腦不頑固，有着現代的新思想，這就可以使兒女們多受些教育，但與大學是無緣的，至多不過高中吧了。因為父母的力量無法負担兒女們的大學教育費用。</p>
<p>在「中華萬歲」中描寫的一對中國老夫婦，決不會是小地主；因為小地主們是不肯到自己田里去耕種的；那麼，他們至多也不過是一個自耕農。在自耕農的家庭里會有一個女兒在外面受高等教育，豈不是一件奇事嗎？</p>
<p>在美國當然是算不了什麼，在中國可就不同了。中國的農民是靠一雙手在田里做工，工作的效率是有限的；美國是用機器種田的，他們用機器種田所得到的收獲，當然是可以有餘錢讓兒女們去讀書。同時，他們是一個進步的國家，男女是平等的，所以受教育也是平等的。而中國呢？手工的收獲數量決超不了機器的收獲成績；同時，男女平等只是智識階級利社會男女的招牌，在鄉村和一切的家庭里是不存在的；這和經濟條件有關。</p>
<p>所以，在「中華萬歲」里的這一點，只是美國人腦子里的想像，並不是我們中國的情形。由這點可以看出，美國人對我們中國的農村經濟，農民生活，尚未被消滅的封建意識和重男輕女的舊觀念等等，都沒有真正的瞭解。他們所謂的瞭解，只是一層表皮而已！</p>
<h3 id="c167">實驗戲劇學校的展望 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 顧仲彜</p>
<p>市立實騐戲劇學校自從去年十一月成立到現在，前後已有七個月了。在七個月中間先修理佔了兩個月，春季學期已上了將近四個月的課，不久以後，就要放暑假了。從草創到現在，時間上雖僅七個多月，但艱辛苦鬥的經過可以寫上一本書，這部書我預備將來空暇一點就開始寫，作後來辦劇校者一點前車之鑑，或者可以减少一點寃枉的苦頭和免走許多灣曲的路。可是目前仍然頭緒紛繁，手忙脚亂，寫下來也是不中看的。不過為了使社會人士對於劇校有清楚的了解起見，不能不把現狀約略說個大槪。</p>
<p>（一）設備方面</p>
<p>劇校的地點在北四川路橫浜橋北堍前日本第一國民小學。牠是一座四層樓的大洋房，底層是辦公室，木工室，電工室，膳聽，會客室，學生自治會辦事室及交際室。二層是教室，排練室，歌唱室及圖書館。三層是市立博物館。四層是小型劇塲，學生宿舍及儲藏室。校舍前面是一片操塲和球塲。後面有游泳池。</p>
<p>屋子裏面的設備，因經費關係，尚未佈置完善，例如木工室裏只有幾塊破舊的佈景電工室一無所有，教室裏全是矮小的課桌椅（日本小學留下來的），圖書館裏除購置了少數的劇本外，其餘全是日本書。祇有小型劇塲已大體添置完全，台深二十四尺寬二十八尺，燈光設備和幕布已都大致不差了。曾經公演過一次，演出了幾個獨幕劇。</p>
<p>（二）科別方面</p>
<p>目前分正科和研究班。正科分話劇電影兩科，科下分技術和演員兩組。研究班以研究編導為宗旨，資格須大學畢業或同等學力，有編導經騐而能直接閱讀英法文者。正科以初中程度投攷，但也有高中畢業和大學肄業的。目前正科生有九十餘人，研究班只有三人。</p>
<p>（三）教授方面</p>
<p>劇校唯一可以驕傲的地方，就是所聘專任教授和兼當主任的全是全國第一流戲劇名家。吳仭之先生是我們的教務主任，兼授。黃佐臨先生是我們的話劇科主任兼基本排練和導演術的教授。張駿祥先生是我們的電影科主任兼基本排練和導演指導的教授。李健吾先生是我們的實騐劇塲主任兼劇本分析和名劇選讀的教授。其他還有師陀，余楠秋，茹技，胡馨庵，嚴工上，Sokolsky，陳　，呂白克諸先生，分別担任，文學史藝術槪論，化裝，舞台技術，排練，國語，舞踏，歌唱等重要功課。</p>
<p>其他課外還有崑曲研究，鋼琴訓練等　別訓練的課，都請專家陛炳　潘美波等担任。早上七時一刻有早操，下午四時有球類運動，分別請專家曹裕王季淮等先生作指導。</p>
<p>（四）演出方面</p>
<p>在短短七個月中已經正式公演了兩次，第一次是三月初在蘭心大戲院上演顧一樵先生編劇吳仭之胡馨庵兩先生導演之古城烽火，第二次是五月終在本校小型劇塲裏演出劊子手和未婚夫妻兩個獨幕劇。第三次公演擬在暑假開始的時候，劇目預定為同胞姊妹，開幕之前，和鍍金三獨幕劇由胡馨庵冀佐臨吳仭之三先生分別担任導演。</p>
<p>附言</p>
<p>這樣一個初具規模的劇校，當前還有許多困難問題。這些困難問題不僅需要全校師生繼續努力，還希望社會人士予以援助。現在我把最重大的問題寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）圖書設備急須添置　圖書和一切技術設備是劇校靈魂寄託所在，而教育局因經費支絀，並無專款撥給我們作添置圖書和技術設備之用。這一次需款當然多多益善，但至少限度當在二百萬元左右，方能略具規模。</p>
<p>（二）專任教授不够分配　教育局規定專任教員只有十二人，照目前情形已不够支配，許多重要科目的教授還是兼任，到了下學期至少加添兩班，專任教授至少須加聘三分之一，此外歌唱教授和舞蹈教授也應該專任，使他們能有個別教授的時間。</p>
<p>（三）社會對於戲劇不够重視　我國同胞對於戲劇仍然輕視，對於子女進劇校肄業往往加以阻止，因此有許多優秀人材因不得家庭同意而無法入學，眼看着許多有志戲劇青年因家庭反對而中途退學。戲劇教育實在是社會教育中最有效力的工具，而從事戲劇是最高尚的職業，演員是藝術家，不是普通的「戲子」。這一點使劇校遇到極大的障碍。社會對於劇校不够同情，有志研究戲劇的青年不够擇業的自由。</p>
<p>（四）公費名額太少　研究戲劇的青年窮苦的很多，而學校內公費的名額太少（因經費關係），許多窮苦而有志的青年就不得其門而入。劇校方面一面希望社會人士能寄以同情而予以貸金，一面擬作實習公演，將收入盈利作為窮苦學生的生活津貼。再一方面希望政府當局明瞭戲劇教育的重要，而特別給以很多的公費名額。</p>
<p>劇校將來是否有望，全看上面許多困難問題是否能够於最短期間很順利的解決。我們自己的力量很薄弱，但社會上對我們表十二分同情的也很多，希望能够給我們物質或精神上的援助。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>昨晚，赴車站送友人行。一進站，就見到兩張舖着白布的桌子，變　白衣人坐着，那是專爲旅客打防疫針的小組。</p>
<p>據說，因爲上海霍亂猖獗，購買火車票者必須繳騐已打防疫針的證件。我問友人曾否照辦，他說票係托人代購，未聞要繳騐什麼防疫證，我再走到旅客出口處一看，却也不見有什麼人員在査騐防疫證。</p>
<p>我們知這，中國民智落後，獨着其身的惰性又根深蒂固，打防疫針雖是對已有益的事，也往往需强而後可。防疫小組設在火車站，輪船碼頭或飛機塲上，固然是歡迎任何旅客去打針的，但若不在出口處査騐來滬旅客的防疫證，則來滬旅客又有幾個會抽出匆忙的時間去照顧防疫小組來！我們該專禁霍亂「出口」而任憑霍亂「進口」嗎？</p>
<p>再說，不在常塲購票的旅客似乎就不必有防疫證，那就連禁止「出口」也有「走私」的了。</p>
<h3 id="c171">舊貨攤和便宜貨 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 鋼人</p>
<p>上海，固然多的是發財人；但是更多的是「被發財人」，中下階級市民。因此，舊貨攤多也自然不必奇怪。</p>
<p>你可以在四馬路，復興路置到舊書，本本不缺；到林森路買舊衣服，包你滿意，如果要買木器傢具，常然平濟利路去，應有盡有；而卡德路，虹口虬江路確也可稱「舊百貨大公司」；前些日子賣日本人的「出貨」，現在應該可以賣江海關的　賣的敵僞物資了。</p>
<p>在這些地方，人們常可以找到他所需要的適當而便宜的東西；因之，生意也相當發達。現在夏天到了，那末傍晚時候，沒有烈日，該是最活動的時候；蕩馬路，乘風凉而「塌便宜貨」，何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>不過，不要太快樂，你如果要呆滯一些，說不定上了當吃了虧，還要給人駡「屈死」。</p>
<p>看見別人在誇耀着他買來的便宜貨是怎樣好，怎樣好時，願意切求實際，想省一點錢的人們見了，總該要動心的吧！</p>
<p>因此，你何不也上那兒去！</p>
<p>一看，你差不多可以看到竟都是一副後面馬上可以跟上氣虎虎，狠巴巴的嘴臉的笑面。</p>
<p>一問，討價「着天」，聽了先使你不由得不一嚇，連忙「着地還價」，但是有時的價錢，高得你「着地」了還是不怎樣便宜時，他派頭大來些的賣給你，而你碰巧又看到了一些微小的疵痕，你想一想，不舒服；但祗等你運疑一下，問上一句！哼！那就</p>
<p>兩眼一彈，兩臂一义，「你預備買嗎？（！）」</p>
<p>必得逼得你不舒服地買了不止，再讓你在組聲惡駡中走開。</p>
<p>「好人」不是沒有，但這樣的事委實很多。</p>
<p>便宜貨，有的是！這種事件你可「吃得消」！</p>
<p>因此，你非得有方法不可！</p>
<p>吿訴你，千萬別太貪便宜，因爲世界沒有誰肯「吃虧」的，你必得先打定主張，要買什麽？順便看見什麼也要？預備多少錢？（當然指有相當便宜程度的。）然後放心大胆地去吧。</p>
<p>本來，買舊貨，也沒有一定的法則；總之，你必定要有主意，有眼光，</p>
<p>你決不會遇見彈限睛，粗無駡，也想不到會發生什麽事，順利地帶了「成績」回來。</p>
<p>否則，你不這樣預備，沒有這樣本領；就必得預備受一頓惡駡，彈着眼，「你配買嗎？（！）」</p>
<p>到那時，你氣不氣？</p>
<h3 id="c172">配尼西林　取消統制 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>美政府對於國內配售配尼西林的統制，有於七月一日起實行取消之說。因此，藥商曾推派代表，於六月十五日在華盛頓與官方舉行會議，討論配尼西林在各區移動的禁阻問題。因爲目前配尼西林的產量，已相當　沛，很够供醫師的採用。整個美國的新藥業，現在已可每月製成配尼西林二萬萬萬單位，此數字四倍於去年夏季，而些二月份一萬八千三百八十萬萬單位的產量，顯然也增加不了少。</p>
<p>至於出口的統制，在取消國內統制時，似乎還不能同時取消。但照藥業界人看來經過相當時期也決會收消。出口的所以統制，爲防大量售出的結果，將使若干國家，大量購進，而轉售於其他的國家，從中謀利　致使正需要的國家，反購買不到。就過去的情形來說，已證實至少有一個國家，把進口的配尼西林，轉售他國，使之在黑市中買賣。</p>
<p>近來世界各國，都需要向美國購買配尼西林，拉丁美洲諸國所需要者，或可適當供給，但歐洲及遠東，有許多國家，所配到的　尼西林，還是不够應用。申請出口的函電，紛紛寄到美國，在　藥界以爲不久可以適足的數量供給海外。</p>
<p>國內的分配旣不再統制，藥商舉行集會。討論配尼西林的產銷諸問題，自很重要。醫院中缺少配尼西林的恐慌，不久即可消除，而予以適當的供應。配尼西林治病的範圖雖然很廣泛，但美國藥業界人相信夏季的需要，必較平時减少。</p>
<p>關於配尼西林的製造，不但針劑，在加多之中，就是藥片及其他方式者，也在積極製造中，以作吞服，敷塗之用。配尼西林的售價，已相當平穩，並無過大的漲落。據藥業界人所說，短時期內，當不會過分上漲，但同時也不致十分跌落。未來的變動，祗是百分之幾的上下而已。</p>
<p>目前吞服的配尼西林，和針劑一樣，受人歡迎。以美國的售價來說，十二片一盒，含有配尼西林三十萬單位的，售美金二元二角五分，而含有三十萬單位的針劑爲一元八角。藥片所以比針劑爲貴，主要原因，就是製造時所費成本，當然要加在售價裏面。藥片與針劑，售價因此是不同的。</p>

<p>無法投遞的信</p>
<p>Ｘ：在你甜蜜的新婚期中，恕我這被遺忘了的人又得打擾你幾分鐘了。你還記得在你結婚的時候，你曾怨過我爲什麽不去向你道喜。小姐，當這句話入了我的耳朶的時候，我的心情的起伏是不難想像的了。</p>
<p>X：你還記得我們相職的時侯，你還記得我倆在月夜散步的　夢嗎？從那時候起，我不敢說是每天必定要念到你，但我能說至少每天在我的腦海中有過四五次你的影像，直到現在，直到永遠。雖說我倆相識的不久，但我取說我已陷於不可自拔的深海中了。在那海中，我有的是希望，有的是安慰，有的是甜蜜。誰知這些盡成了今日的苦杯。辛酸和苦痛，豈是以前所種的收穫。誰說祗是辛酸和苦痛，難道心也該枯竭，淚也該淚盡，迎鮮血也該崩溢的嗎？</p>
<p>星星護着的月亮，還是和去年一樣。曾記得去年今日，我因了廠事要暫離上海。也和今天一樣的前晚，我和你慢慢地踱在柏油路上，在那寂靜的路上，樹枝爲我們饗靑節拍，微風在送着我倆的和嗚，細濛拂在臉上，分不出是憂是愁，說不盡心頭的空虛。我的口嘯爲我吹着離別之曲。你呢？一聲也不饗的僅是緊依在我的身旁，那閃亮着的眼光祗是對我發着依戀。不，那是閃鑠的水珠兒。</p>
<p>我也緊樓着你，怕失去似的樓着你，不知是否細雨的作祟。我的兩頰上也掛上了水珠兒，但這不是水珠。</p>
<p>X：記否我的一付藏在上衣袋裏的一付眼鏡是怎樣碎的，僅是無言的擁抱。說完了心中所要說的一切，誰管那碎在口袋裘的眼鏡兒呢？但是時計的移動撥開了我倆的身子，誰知這一別竟成永別，這可惡的時計啊！爲什麽你當時不永遠的停止呢？</p>
<p>勝利的炮竹喚回了異鄕的人兒，可是勝利的炮竹也炸碎了一顆滿載着希望的心。</p>
<p>滿懷了重逢之樂歸人竟連你的面亦不曾見過一决，直到了一天在結婚廣吿中看到了你的名字，同時手中也拿到了一對你給我的信。但這那兒是信，簡直是一張催命符—一張粉紅色的請帖，飛，在外鄉受盡了人事卑下的欺壓，怎還受得了這大的一個打擊，你請我一定要去參加你的結婚宴會，這不像是要拿刀架着請我上斷頭台嗎？於是，我頹唐，我墮落，但時代叫回了我，國事推醒了我，我還有我的前程！</p>
<p>我的眼在模糊了，我的心在啜泣，而我的手，能傳達我心情萬一的手也在顫抖了。</p>
<p>我不能再想，我不能再寫，我怕我的字會被我的淚水冲淡。我怕我的顫抖的心會因此而中止，我就在這裏停筆了。</p>
<p>雖是寫好了的信兒又向誰寄呢？我悵然了，因爲世上已經失去了一位小姐而添了一位太太了，我怎麽能使這封信寄給這位小姐呢？我祇得在這兒永遠的祝程</p>

<p>第三，圖書館業務星期日似不宜停頓，市立圖書館雖仍開放，舉凡借書等業務，均吿停頓，電梯亦不開放。</p>

<p>— 恨忻</p>
<p>七月九日自由談刋登「奶粉和麫粉的謎」一文，作者提出兩個謎樣的怪事：第一，行總免費配給與學生的奶粉內含細砂，而且有沉澱，到底是不是聯總由美國運來的，爲什麽味道不像克輿奶粉。第二，甲長吩咐領戶口麫粉，待拿了麫粉袋去領時，甲長回說是保長通知，保長回說去問甲長，害那位朋友東跑西跑，仍然一無所得。</p>
<p>其實這兩件事並不怪，我不妨以小民的立塲代爲解釋，看這些意思倒底與負責當局所言有無不同。</p>
<p>行總配與學生的奶粉的確由美運來，不過是脫脂的（克寗奶粉是全脂的），只可吃飽肚皮，並無營養價值，而這些救濟奶粉運到上海後，大概一直擱在倉庫裘，等到救濟老爺們想起時，奶粉已經變質（奶粉極易壞，全脂的也然，學生所配得的奶粉領到時，已結成鵝卵大小的硬塊），自然要發生沉澱或酸味的現象。「橘逾淮而成枳，」所以不必怪別人，祗好怪自已沒有口福了。</p>
<p>領戶口麫粉，本來升斗小民都如大早之望雲霓，所以那位作者會興匆匆地跑來跑去，但結果爲何領不到呢，大約該保田長體恤人民，領麫粉旣非事實，而自己又無出錢發放的能力，所以故意這麽一說，使小民可得到一雲那的希望與快樂。至於事後互相推諉責任，可說是官場固有的習慣，毫不寄怪，倒是那位作者憧憬着着靑美國奶粉和戶口麫粉而失望的，却非常可憐！</p>

<p>閱七月九日　貴　判有晏安「奶粉和麫粉的謎」一文，說吃了配給的奶粉，會腹瀉，我亦有同樣的經過，曾經去請敎過一位醫生據他的表示說：「現在市上出售的奶粉，像克寗，好立克，金山，各種的牌子，全係全脂奶粉，內含脂肪質甚多，假使冲食過多，腸胃難於消化，稍一受凉，就會腹瀉。普通成人冲食奶粉每天多以一兩爲限，過多即不相宜。致於小孩，腸胃消化力薄弱，更應酌量减少。常吃奶粉，容易便結，要時置水果吃，輔佐消化。</p>
<p>冲奶粉，通常用冷開水或溫水少許冲入奶粉內，盡力用筷或茶匙拌和，不使稍有少許未拌和，再逐漸用沸水冲入，同時以筷或茶匙調和，倘使事　則沒有拌和，就有黃色奶塊浮、起，奶粉凝結成塊，最難消化，亟應注意。</p>
<p>致於目前配給給學生吃的奶粉—脫脂奶粉，內無脂肪質，色白粉細，與全脂奶粉帶有黃色不同，用水拌冲　亦無凝性，沸水冲調，一層白色的物體，沉澱水底，略有酸味，似已變質，無怪一輩學生都不喜歡吃它。</p>

<p>這一夜我喜而不寐，有如三十年前新婚之夜一樣的甜蜜，一個身禮，捨不得離開你的牀；兩個眼睛，捨不得離開你的臉，一直坐　了天明。試越一件無價之寶，失而醒穗，人生快意事，真的是無過於此了。天明之後，我忙不迭的寫了一封信給鄒荊老，報吿這喜出望外的喜訊。幷託他老人家代邀名西醫兪起華聲師來給你診治。整整的一個上午，我老是哄着你睡，而你却仍然毫無睡意，還是刺刺不休的說話，一會兒喚運兒，問吃過了點心沒有？一會兒喚世京，問他的三個孩子都好麼？一會兒又喚葆妹和葉媽，問她們爲甚麼不去睡覺？我因你平日間多憂多慮，以致招惹了這樣的一塲大病，趁這起死問生的當兒，便勸你從此以後，要多多的尋鞦作樂，不要再自尋煩惱，你似　似喜的瞅了我一眼道：「猪　頭，我有甚麼不快樂啊！」這一聲「猪　頭」，引得大家都笑了。我捱了駡，也兀自暗暗得意，覺得新婚時閨房調笑之樂，如在目前。</p>
<p>我驚魂已定，心花漸開，飯也自然而然的吃得下了。到午後一點半鐘光景，錚兒和玲兒接到了長途電話和電報，膽戰心驚的從上海趕回來了，我聞聲迎了出去，他們一見了我，忙問母親怎樣，止不住都掉下眼淚來。</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Chairman Chiang is scheduled to fly directly to Jiujiang on the Meiling special plane tomorrow morning, and then proceed to Lushan. It is reported that when the special plane arrives in Xun, he will meet with the heads of the Jiangxi provincial government, military, party, and organizations, and comfort the elders of Jiangxi who have been separated for nine years, as well as compatriots from all walks of life. Accompanying him are Wu Dingchang, the Secretary-General of the National Government, and several senior officials of the National Government. The Chairman's entourage plans to travel to Xun on two separate planes. It is also learned that the Chairman, upon hearing that all sectors in Nanchang and Jiujiang were preparing grand welcomes, and fearing that the prolonged waiting in the sweltering heat would be tiresome, sent a telegram expressing his thanks. It is also reported that after a short rest in Xun, the Chairman will personally inspect Nanchang.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] It is reported that Madame Chiang plans to stay in Nanjing with Marshal Ma and his wife to await meeting Ambassador Stuart, so she plans to fly to Xun tomorrow afternoon. It is said that Marshal Ma still has matters to attend to in Nanjing, but will not stay long, as the Marshal Ma's residence in Kuanglu is ready and waiting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] Ambassador Stuart is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 15th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party were unusually quiet all day today. The attention of reporters in the capital has now shifted to the Chairman's and Marshal Ma's trip to Lushan, and the arrival date of U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart. It is reported that after Ambassador Stuart arrives in Nanjing, he will stay at Marshal Ma's residence. If Marshal Ma is to go to Lushan, it will be decided after Ambassador Stuart arrives in Nanjing. According to sources at Marshal Ma's residence today, Marshal Ma indeed intends to go to Lushan for a summer retreat. However, this is not enough to suggest that Marshal Ma is weary of the KMT-CPC negotiations. It is widely rumored in Nanjing today that the negotiations on various unresolved issues between the government and the CCP may be moved to Lushan to continue. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent personnel to Lushan half a month ago to arrange accommodation for foreign envoys stationed in China.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] According to a certain authoritative source: Judging from the current signs after the Chairman's visit to Jiangxi, it seems that the peace negotiations are still intended to continue in Nanjing. Whether the KMT-CPC negotiations will be moved to Lushan will depend on the degree of factual developments. As of 11 p.m. tonight, there has been no news of representatives from either side going to Lushan. The biggest difficulty in Lushan at present is the housing shortage, because in the past nine years, the enemy and puppets only engaged in destruction and not construction in Lushan. The Jiangxi provincial government is now actively planning to build houses.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] According to reliable sources: The military three-person conference may be moved to Lushan to be held. It is also reported that Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, due to his illness not yet recovered, is not suitable for flying and will take a specially prepared warship to Lushan. In addition, the five-person talks, which have been held four times, will not be convened at present because some issues cannot be resolved.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The military three-person conference is expected to be held in the near future. The government is now drafting a plan in response to the CCP's request to transfer the Communist forces in the Subei and Central Plains regions to North China, in order to reasonably resolve this major side issue.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Central Committee member Liang Hancao will return to Nanjing from Shanghai in the next few days and then proceed to Lushan to lecture at the Lushan summer camp at the invitation of the Central Headquarters of the Three Principles of the People Youth League. Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng and Minister Chen Lifu also plan to go to Lushan.</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai Visited Marshal Ma Yesterday</p>
<p>Discussed the Yellow River Blocking Issue</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The attitude of the attendants and interpreters at Marshal Ma's residence towards the interviews of Nanjing reporters today has become more taciturn, because Marshal Ma believes that meaningless disclosures do not help the facts. However, it is learned that Zhou Enlai visited Marshal Ma at 2 p.m. today for a long talk lasting three hours, and left at 5:30 p.m. The content of the conversation covered two topics: the Yellow River flooding and relief supplies. Regarding the Yellow River issue, because the Yellow River dike repair and blocking project is imminent, the Huayuankou project is nearing completion, and the water should return to its old course. However, the Communist side has been delaying the dike repair project, and blaming the government for not paying the construction costs, making it impossible to proceed. It is reported that when Zhou Enlai met with Marshal Ma today, he said that if the government completes the Huayuankou blocking project and releases water into the old course, they will build a high embankment downstream as a "self-defense measure" to cause the Yellow River to backflow, placing Kaifeng and other places in a watery state, and asked Marshal Ma to present this idea to the Chairman on his behalf. Although this is a threatening statement, the sinister intentions of the CCP can be imagined from this. In light of the CCP's past practice of harming the people to achieve its goals, this move is particularly noteworthy. Regarding the issue of relief supplies, Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to the Director of the United Relief Agency. (Please refer to page two)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Amidst the impending meeting between Du and Lin, it is reported that the U.S. is attempting to establish a buffer zone in northern Songhua River. It is learned that the Executive Group is now mediating on the north bank of the Songhua River, planning to use the Red House as a buffer zone, with the KMT and Communist armies retreating 3,000 meters each. However, the government and the CCP have not yet reached a complete agreement on this. The Songhua River is currently calm, but the situation north of Shenyang is slightly tense. It is reported that more than 10,000 Communist troops have been added to the Kuping area, seemingly intending to counterattack Faku. The signs of the Communist army withdrawing from Harbin are becoming increasingly apparent. Currently, 70 tons of vehicles are used daily to transport materials to Jiamusi and Qiqihar. It is rumored that Gu Zhutong's trip to the Northeast is related to preparations for receiving Harbin.</p>

<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Youth Party leader Zuo Shunsheng met with a reporter from the French News Agency today, discussing his views on the current situation. He said that convening the National Assembly is a reasonable move, and his party does not oppose it. There are still four months before the Assembly is convened. During this period, the following three issues must be resolved: (1) the exact number of representatives and the allocation of seats in the National Assembly; (2) the continued discussion of the constitutional issue; and (3) the reorganization of the government. He does not oppose convening a Political Consultative Conference to re-discuss the above issues, but he particularly supports adopting other methods, such as informal exchanges of views, or individual meetings between government and party representatives. However, the spirit of the five resolutions passed by the PCC should still be upheld.</p>

The outcome of the conflict is not yet known. The Communist army in central Hebei is also becoming more active. According to military sources, the large-scale movement of the Communist army has made Baoding feel threatened. Ten regiments of Communist troops have concentrated in the Tang County and Zhengding areas. It is also rumored that the Communist army in Shijiazhuang, Gaoyi, Handan, Zhanghe, and Yuanshi are also on the move.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 13th] In recent days, the Communist army in Subei transferred more than 13,000 people from southern Shandong and concentrated them in Huaiyin, using civilian boats for transportation. They gathered in Gaoyou, wearing khaki uniforms with the words "Liberation" on their armbands, and were commanded by Zhang Aiping. In addition, Xu Xueshi (one leg), Mao Zedong's brother-in-law, recently led a rabble, falsely claiming to be tens of thousands of troops, with several heavy artillery pieces and more than 100 light and heavy machine guns, moving south from Huaiyin along Huainan, and it is said they are preparing to attack Yangtai counties.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The war in Shandong will continue to develop. The meeting between Wang Yaowu and Chen Yi failed to materialize. To extinguish the flames of war in Shandong, Marshall specially telegraphed the U.S. military commander in Qingdao, Clayman, to mediate the meeting between Wang and Chen. After several telegraphic exchanges, Wang Yaowu decided to fly to Qingdao this morning to meet with Chen Yi. The Military Mediation Department also agreed to this. Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Government, flew to Jinan yesterday to study the matter with Wang Yaowu and decided to fly to Qingdao on the same plane this morning. However, Wang Yaowu suddenly received a telegram from Clayman last night, saying that Chen Yi had telegraphed him, saying that he could not go. Wang then canceled his trip. This morning, only Cai Wenzhi flew from Jinan to Qingdao, but he could not land due to a storm in Qingdao and returned. During the journey, the plane also lost its direction and nearly crashed. It could not land in Jinan, groped at low altitude, and flew back to Beiping.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 13th] The Qingdao peace talks originally scheduled for the 13th were canceled because Chen Yi, commander of the Communist New Fourth Army, could not attend. Clayman telegraphed Commander Ding Zhipan to inform Commander Wang Yaowu, asking him to stop coming to Qingdao.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Completely Destroyed by the Communist Army <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 13th] The Communist army (Central Plains Military Region) has completely destroyed the Luoshan Agreement of February 23 this year and the agreement established in Hankou on May 10 by Byrde, Xu Yongchang, and Zhou Enlai. Since June 25, the units under the command of Li Xiannian, "Central Plains Military Region," including Wen Jianwu, Wang Shusheng, and Zhang Tixue, have unauthorizedly crossed the area stipulated in the Luoshan Agreement (i.e., the area where the Communist troops should stay east of the Pinghan Road: Baiquanyuan, Chenjiafan, Zhoujiaweizi, Wenshusi, Zhangjiagang, Zhangjiawan, Huwan, Shitou'ao, and Zao Shu Cen), and moved east and west. Since the 29th, they have launched large-scale attacks on KMT troops in various places. Those expanding eastward have expanded about 220 kilometers, invading areas north of Huangmei and near Lihuang in Anhui Province. Those expanding westward have expanded about 270-280 kilometers, invading areas near Baokang and within the territory of Xichuan and Neixiang in Henan Province. Wherever the Communist army sets foot, they implement their consistent poisonous methods, killing the old and weak, burning houses, raping women, plundering materials, and coercing strong men, creating a great chaos in the local area. The tragic situation of ten empty houses out of ten is still expanding. On the 11th, the 2,000-strong column of Wang Shusheng of the Communist army had approached 10 kilometers southeast of Baokang and is continuing to press towards the city walls. Baokang was the rear of the front line during the War of Resistance. When the Japanese repeatedly crossed the Xiang River and invaded the west, it accommodated the refugees from the front and protected northern Sichuan, making great contributions to the War of Resistance. This area, which was not disturbed by the Japanese, is now suffering from the ravages of the Communist army, which is infinitely painful. More than 3,000 troops of Wang Shusheng's column attempted to continue crossing the Xiang River through Liushuigou (south of Yicheng) on the 12th, but were blocked by the KMT army and failed. The KMT army is also expelling the Communist army that invaded Nanzhang and recovered the city on the 11th. The people are returning from the surrounding villages and sorting out their industries that were destroyed by the Communist army. Three units of Wen Jianwu's column led by Li Xiannian crossed the Dan River on the 12th, south of Neixiang and north of Li Guanqiao, passing through Makuaipu (10 kilometers east of Xichuan), bypassing north of Xichuan, and sneaking to near Dashiqiao northwest of Xichuan, attempting to cross the Dan River to the south and invade Junxian. They are currently in fierce fighting after being blocked by the KMT army. The Communist army is now attempting to converge on Mount Wudang from the north and south, and then continue to invade the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi. Another unit of about 1,000 Communist troops sneaked to the Fangcheng Min area of Nanyang on the 12th, destroying highways and electric wires, and the materials of the local people were also looted.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 13th] Chief Cheng Qian of the Xingying recently stated at a joint party, government, and military reception for reporters: The Communist army's intrusions in Hubei are becoming increasingly rampant. The fighting on the east and west banks of the Xiang River is intense. The Communist army kills the innocent, burns homes, plunders property, and forcibly conscripts laborers wherever they go. The people are heartbroken by these four atrocities. When reporters asked about the Communist army's intentions and combat posture, Cheng replied that, judging from the current signs, the Communist army seems to be intruding towards the border of Sichuan or Shaanxi and may leave Hubei soon. When asked about the safety of Wuhan, Cheng smiled calmly and said, "The behavior of rats is difficult to prevent. Although the suffering of the people is worrying, the problem is not too serious." Finally, Cheng solemnly pointed out that all the areas intruded by the Communist army are KMT defense zones, which clearly shows who is the chief culprit. In addition, Zheng, director of the staff office of the Xingying, told reporters: Yesterday, the U.S. representative of the Ninth Executive Group asked if he was willing to hold peace talks again, and he immediately replied "Of course." The government and U.S. representatives of the group, Lu Jishi and He Zhujian, are scheduled to fly to Laohekou tomorrow to mediate peace with the Communist army headquarters. However, the Communist representative has not yet decided to go, citing that he has lost contact with the Central Plains Military Region.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 13th] Two units of the Communist army secretly crossed the Xiang River yesterday in separate routes. Among them, the vanguard of Luo Houfu's troops has sneaked into Baokang County. Another unit of the Communist army had a fierce battle with the KMT army in Puhe Brain. They are currently being blocked on the east bank of the Xiang River and seem to be turning north. The KMT army is blocking and attacking. In addition, a unit of Li Xiannian's troops marched south from Mengjialou, attempting to invade Laohekou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 13th] The Communist army has now launched an offensive against eastern Henan again and captured Zhecheng on the 12th.</p>
<p>Hankou Executive Group Discusses Mediation Work</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 13th] Major General Lu Jishi (newly appointed), the government representative of the Ninth Group of the Military Mediation Department, Xue Zizheng, the Communist representative, and He Zhujian, the U.S. representative, have been discussing mediation work for days after reporting on the conflict in central Hubei to Nanjing. In addition, Zheng Shaowen, the Communist Party's spokesperson in Hankou, has left Hankou with his entourage, and his office in Hankou has also been closed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Related sources claim that Marshall summoned the Xuanhuadian and Hankou groups to inquire about the true situation after the war on the border between Henan and Hubei, and proposed a ceasefire between the two sides: (1) designate the Communist army's garrison; (2) supply the Communist army. However, no results have been achieved yet. Senior CCP officials here admitted that the Communist army's actions in the Laohekou area on the border between Henan and Hubei were to meet its "Central Plains Military Region" troops going north, and said that "the Central Plains war has a tendency to spread like wildfire." It also claimed that there would be a major war in Subei as well.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 12th] When the Commander's Office left the pass, it followed the instructions of its superiors and promulgated regulations on the reporting of Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese war criminals. It was re-announced in Shenyang on April 11. To date, the Commander's Office has captured 12 groups of war criminals based on public reports, totaling 52 people. After interrogation, it was determined that they were guilty. Among them, international war criminals Japanese Lieutenant General Yamaki, Major General Takeda Seiichi, Colonel Matsuda Genji, and three Italians have been transferred to the International Court for trial in separate cases. The rest have been escorted to the Northeast Military Tribunal for trial. Now that the period for sending back Japanese and Korean expatriates is approaching, it is deeply feared that war criminals who have not been reported will mingle among them and take the opportunity to escape. Therefore, the previous order is reaffirmed. All people in the Northeast who have been victimized are urged to quickly report them so that they can be punished according to the law. The names and crimes of the war criminals who have already been arrested will be announced successively.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] General He Yingqin, accompanied by Qin Decheng, Vice Minister of National Defense, and Zhu Shiming, Head of the Military Representative Delegation to Japan, traveled to the Yokohama South Pier this morning to inspect our navy. Our naval officers and soldiers, dressed in immaculate white naval uniforms, stood in attention, respectfully listening to General He's address. General He arrived in Tokyo yesterday afternoon and visited General MacArthur. Ambassador Acheson, MacArthur's political advisor, will host a reception for General He, who is scheduled to depart for the United States the day after tomorrow to assume the post of Head of the Chinese Delegation to the United Nations Military Staff Committee. General He plans to visit the famous hot spring city of Atami tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th, Associated Press] Acheson, MacArthur's chief foreign policy advisor and chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, hosted a banquet at the Imperial Hotel this noon to welcome General He Yingqin, and invited prominent figures from various circles to attend.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Since our naval officers and soldiers, wearing beautiful white uniforms, appeared on the streets of Tokyo, they have aroused speculation among the general public. The cleanliness and discipline of our naval uniforms have not only been highly praised by the Japanese, but have also left a deep impression on Allied personnel. A reporter overheard a Japanese woman saying to another woman, "The Chinese navy wearing the Blue Sky White Sun insignia on their shoulders have a very serious demeanor." This has aroused widespread speculation here, with Japanese people mistakenly believing that the Chinese naval officers and soldiers strolling on the shore are the vanguard of the Chinese occupation forces in Japan. Even reporters from the US military newspaper "Stars and Stripes" rushed to the Central News Agency's Tokyo office this morning to inquire whether the Chinese naval officers and soldiers appearing on the streets of Tokyo are the advance force of the Chinese occupation forces in Japan.</p>

<h3 id="e37">UNRRA Agrees to Exclude Transportation Equipment from Suspension; LaGuardia Reports to US Senate Committee, China Office Must Be Reorganized <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] According to reliable sources from China, due to the strong demands of the Chinese government to UNRRA in Washington, UNRRA has agreed to exclude medical supplies and transportation equipment from the suspended materials. Therefore, automobiles, locomotives, barges, gasoline, and lubricating oil have been listed alongside food and can still be shipped to China. Without the supply of transportation equipment, UNRRA will not be able to achieve the task of distributing food and supplies to the inland areas, as hoped by Director LaGuardia. In Shanghai, the UNRRA Shanghai office stated that it has not yet received official news on this matter, but believes that if this is the case, it will be announced publicly. It also stated that even if medicines and transportation tools can be shipped to China as usual, several supplies of the highest value, such as industrial and agricultural machinery and equipment, will still be on the suspension list. It also stated that it cannot currently confirm whether the complete suspension of these types of materials has been decided, but this view is very reasonable. It also stated that it is currently seeking confirmation that Chinese sources believe that LaGuardia's suspension order was caused by a mixture of misinformation, misunderstanding, and hasty action. They firmly believe that LaGuardia's actions were taken without first receiving a final telegram from UNRRA officials stationed in China, and without fully appreciating Chairman Chiang's response, "This matter is being handled by Premier Song." According to recent statistics, the situation in various Chinese ports has improved greatly in recent days. For example, in Shanghai alone, since June 27, a total of 491,237 tons of relief supplies have been accumulated, of which 464,512 tons have been distributed to the inland areas. What remains is only 10% of the original total. In fact, the handling of transportation equipment and food is better than what these numbers indicate. The delays are mainly for heavy equipment for agricultural and industrial reconstruction, which must first be unpacked and inspected in Shanghai, and then re-shipped to the inland areas.</p>
<p>LaGuardia Describes Details of the Suspension</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] UNRRA Director General LaGuardia reported to the Senate Investigation Committee today on the details of the suspension of relief supplies to China. It is said that the telegram he sent to Chairman Chiang stated that the welfare of China is related to all the people of the country, and not just to any individual or group. Therefore, the wording was straightforward, not diplomatic, in order to make him understand the truth. The telegram stated: Assistance to China's reconstruction work must be genuine, and stated: "The welfare of your country is related to all the people of the country, and cannot be used to deal with the special interests of any individual or group. Therefore, individuals and politics cannot be involved. I believe the Chairman feels the same way." LaGuardia's telegram was sent before the announcement of the suspension of relief supplies, and also before the 300 UNRRA Shanghai employees jointly filed a complaint. LaGuardia, at the Senate Investigation Committee, attributed the responsibility for the dissatisfaction with the distribution of relief supplies in China to the Chinese government and the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, and said that the UNRRA China Office, from top to bottom, was completely ineffective and must be reorganized. LaGuardia's telegram to Chairman Chiang also stated that relief supplies were not being transported to the inland areas, but were being resold, causing most of the supplies to flow into the black market. This method must be changed. Government officials cannot be given preferential treatment in the distribution of these international relief items. UNRRA must receive more funding to facilitate its progress. To improve matters, the Chinese government can send three representatives to discuss with three UNRRA representatives to agree on a long-term plan to ensure effectiveness and integrity. LaGuardia also stated that he had not received a reply from Chairman Chiang before attending the Senate Committee earlier this week. LaGuardia appeared before the Senate Committee today at the request of Republican Senator Brewster. Brewster stated at the investigation committee that after the facts of how certain countries used UNRRA relief items are fully exposed, it will definitely become an "international corruption case." Brewster opposed the suspension of relief supplies to China, while continuing to provide relief to Yugoslavia and Poland. The abuse of UNRRA relief items in those two countries is also well known to us, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e38">New York Times Comments on the Suspension, Only the Starving Suffer <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 12th] The New York Times commented yesterday that the UNRRA report submitted to Congress on June 29 believed that the difficulty of implementing relief work in China was akin to trying to climb a tree to catch a fish. It is said that unless one million tons of food can be shipped to China before the end of June 1946, five million to ten million starving people can be expected to avoid starvation. Given what "UNRRA" has done so far, these millions of starving people will obviously not be saved, and the $600 million relief plan has failed.</p>
<p>LaGuardia's suspension of the shipment of materials (except for staple foods) to China may be necessary in form, but only the millions of starving people suffer. We must intensify our efforts to bring about peace in China.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] UNRRA confirmed today that it had received a joint complaint from 300 employees in Shanghai regarding the inefficiency of the China Office. However, LaGuardia made no comment. The Washington Evening Report commented that this matter should be given immediate attention at the highest level. UNRRA should conduct a thorough investigation and implement improvements so that United Nations aid to China can be honest, free from corruption, impartial, and with minimal waste. Americans have contributed the most to UNRRA, so they pay special attention to this case, it said.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] After receiving LaGuardia's notification of the suspension of some aid materials to China, Zhou Enlai replied to LaGuardia, requesting that some effective measures be taken to remedy the unsatisfactory situation. The matters he proposed include: (1) At the 20th UNRRA Far East Regional Conference, scheduled to be held in Shanghai on July 20, the CCP requests the right to speak; (2) Representatives from the CCP area should be allowed to participate in the distribution committees of UNRRA headquarters and branch offices, and obtain senior positions; (3) UNRRA should initiate and organize an investigation team with members from UNRRA headquarters, branch offices, and representatives from the CCP area, to investigate the actual situation in various regions and propose suggestions for the distribution of relief supplies.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 12th] Li Yinchun, Director of the Military Law Department of the Northeast Security Commander's Headquarters, was ordered to take over the Shenyang enemy puppet prison and affiliated factories. Without prior approval, he sold public property from the two factories. After Director Du learned about this, he was extremely angry. On the 7th, Li Yinchun fled in fear of punishment. The Commander's Headquarters immediately dismissed him and issued an arrest warrant. After various investigations, it was learned that Li Yinchun was still hiding in Shenyang, so a detection and arrest network was set up, and he was finally captured on the 7th. Director Du believed that Li Yinchun, as the Director of the Military Law Department, was driven by greed and knowingly violated the law.

A curious reporter visited and asked about the reason. The professor spoke frankly, saying: The professor's salary income is not enough to make a living, so I changed my career. Moreover, teaching dance skills and teaching literature are equally needed, and the income can be increased, so why not do it!</p>
<h3 id="e44">Legislative Yuan Finance and Economics Committee Makes Three Work Reports, Demands Responsible Officials to Give Concrete Answers to Important Current Economic Issues <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] At the 304th meeting of the Legislative Yuan, Zhang Zhaoyuan, a member of the Finance, Economics, Commerce, and Trade Joint Committee, made the third work report, reviewing recent related issues: (1) After the grain loan fraud case occurred in Shanghai, the price of rice per stone jumped from more than 30,000 yuan to 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. After the Resource Committee and the Taiwan Provincial Government jointly established the Taiwan Sugar Company, the domestic sales price of Taiwan sugar per catty suddenly rose from more than 600 yuan to more than 1,400 yuan. Gasoline, automobiles, milk powder, etc., which were originally imported goods, did not rise in price under the efforts of foreign merchants to eliminate the black market. (2) Domestic industries cannot operate due to excessive production costs, and there are cases where they stop production and sell raw materials and machines to pay workers' severance pay. (3) Due to the sharp rise and fall of the bond market in the Shanghai financial market, a major disaster occurred at the end of June, with estimated losses of 150 billion yuan. Several banks and firms went bankrupt as a result. The government's failure to dispel market rumors in a timely manner was largely to blame. (4) UNRRA recently suddenly announced the suspension of the shipment of industrial and agricultural machinery and other relief items to China, and made accusations against our country's distribution methods. The conclusion is that the occurrence of the above problems is further proof of human malfeasance and policy imprudence. Such things should be hated by the highest leaders, and the Executive Yuan certainly does not want to bear the responsibility. This committee has decided to ask the directly responsible主管人员 to give concrete answers, it said.</p>

The so-called "underground private banks" have as many as six or seven hundred. The provincial finance department believes that these private banks are creating hot money, which is disrupting legitimate commercial finance and harming the society and people's livelihood. Zhu Jixin and Su, inspectors from the province, were sent to conduct on-the-ground investigations and found solid evidence of 68 firms.

<h3 id="e50">Editorial: Overseas Chinese Compatriots Need Security <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>When the Father of the Nation was alive, he often said, "Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution." Because more than fifty years ago, we, the revolutionary patriots in the country, under the leadership of the Father of the Nation, opposed the autocratic rule of the Qing Dynasty and began a widespread movement to completely eliminate corrupt politics. We were often oppressed by the tyrannical politics of the time and had to flee overseas. Without the economic and manpower assistance of overseas Chinese compatriots, the success of the first national revolution of our Chinese nation would have been even more arduous and slower.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese compatriots have also proven to have made great contributions during this long eight-year war of resistance. In the beginning, they donated money and aircraft enthusiastically. Later, during the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia, the lives and property of overseas Chinese compatriots in Burma, Vietnam, Malaya, Java, Sumatra, Singapore, the Philippines, and other places were also subjected to extreme killings and damages. Overseas Chinese compatriots, regardless of the period or environment, although geographically separated from the motherland, have always looked forward to the revitalization of the motherland. In the future, under the guidance of the Chairman, we will begin to build a democratic country based on the Three Principles of the People. We need the overseas Chinese compatriots even more to contribute their strength to help the motherland achieve this task as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Our expectations of overseas Chinese compatriots are so great. However, judging from what overseas Chinese compatriots in various places are currently experiencing, it is truly too painful and too unfortunate. Overseas Chinese compatriots in Siam were the first to suffer massacres, and recently, overseas Chinese compatriots in the Dutch East Indies have also suffered large-scale massacres and attacks, which have not yet been completely quelled. In addition, according to the reports we have received, governments in the Philippines, Malaya, Australia, Vietnam, and other places have also imposed legal oppression and restrictions on local overseas Chinese compatriots. Overseas Chinese compatriots originally thought that because we had made great contributions in this war of the Allied nations to eliminate the Axis powers and established national prestige, after the end of the war, we could obtain security in our lives and receive more courteous treatment from local governments in various parts of Southeast Asia. Who knew that today, looking at the facts that are currently being presented, the result is the opposite. The overseas lives of our "mother of the revolution" are being subjected to humiliation, oppression, and massacre, even more severely than before August 13th. Upon careful reflection, the motherland has let them down in terms of responsibility and human sentiment!</p>
<p>It is well known throughout the world that the temperament of our Chinese nation is gentle, peaceful, and kind. Overseas Chinese compatriots abide by the law in various places and are unwilling to slightly overstep the rules, which is also recognized by local governments. Overseas Chinese compatriots have always responded to all insults with extreme patience and tolerance. In terms of work, overseas Chinese compatriots have always been diligent, thrifty, and tireless, using their blood and sweat to develop wilderness in various parts of Southeast Asia and create today's prosperity. It is not an excessive demand for overseas Chinese compatriots in various parts of the world to obtain safety and security, but a right that they should naturally be able to enjoy. However, as the saying goes, "Good people are bullied." The exceptionally honest behavior of overseas Chinese compatriots has instead formed the perception that they are easy targets for bullying, which is truly inappropriate.</p>
<p>The government should use all possible means to secure the safety of the more than 15 million overseas Chinese compatriots. When necessary, the government should not hesitate to adopt a strong stance and must not casually settle matters with a mere protest, and sometimes even be afraid to raise a protest. For example, Siam was originally a small clown role on the side of the Axis powers in this war. In theory, we have the right to punish her a little. When she even overestimated herself and massacred our overseas Chinese compatriots this spring, we could have immediately dispatched a large army from the Vietnam side to enter the northwest border of Siam as a backup for reasoning. Unexpectedly, the government was extremely tolerant and sent a delegation to humbly seek advice, saying many friendly words before perfunctorily settling the matter. However, if Siam again mistreats our overseas Chinese compatriots next time, we should no longer adopt such an overly gentle and humble attitude. For example, in Vietnam, as soon as the national army withdrew, the old laws that abused overseas Chinese compatriots were reportedly gradually being restored. If this is true, we can honestly tell the French government that Vietnam has deep historical ties with our country. All of France's rights in Vietnam were forfeited cleanly by the shameless Vichy government during this war because of its submission. Now that we have taken it back from the enemy and returned it to France, if France treats our overseas Chinese compatriots in Vietnam unkindly, we should also have the right to take it back again. We should now sincerely tell the Indonesian government that if that government can no longer restrain the anti-Chinese and abusive atrocities of the people, then the heroic independence movement of that country will not be sympathized with by us, and we must aid overseas Chinese compatriots and give them the power of self-defense and resistance. Regardless of the place, if we have reason to speak, our attitude towards protecting overseas Chinese compatriots should not be too soft or humiliating. Because overseas Chinese compatriots live scattered all over the world, often our well-intentioned concessions to one place will instead cause misunderstandings in other places, leading them to believe that our overseas Chinese compatriots can be bullied at will.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of how we should help overseas Chinese compatriots, from the reception of those returning to the country during the war to the repatriation to their original places after the war, the central government has stipulated many things. However, the most important and urgent thing at present is nothing more than safeguarding their safety in various parts of the world. We are a country that establishes itself through peace and will never use overseas Chinese as vanguards for invading other people's land. However, when others deliberately infringe upon the safety of our overseas Chinese compatriots, the government of the motherland cannot turn a blind eye.</p>

<h3 id="e51">The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference Concludes; Draft Peace Treaties for Five Nations Have Been Prepared; The German and Austrian Issues Remain Divided <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 13th - The Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference is nearing its end. The finalization of the draft peace treaties for the five nations of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland shows that cooperation among the four powers is not only possible but also substantial. However, during the final stages of the conference when discussing the issues of Germany and Austria, opinions remained greatly divided, reminiscent of the stalemate at last year's London Foreign Ministers' Conference. The greatest achievement of this Foreign Ministers' Conference is the method for dealing with colonial territories and special ports. If the four powers cannot reach an agreement when ultimately resolving these issues in the future, they can be submitted to the United Nations for handling. This sets an important precedent and is a significant contribution to the collective power of world organizations.</p>
<p>[Reuters] Paris, 12th - The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, after several weeks of meetings, concluded tonight. The remaining unresolved issues in the draft peace treaties for the five nations of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland were all submitted to the Twenty-One Nations Peace Conference for discussion. During today's final meeting, Molotov opposed the Four-Power Foreign Ministers conducting preliminary discussions on the Austrian peace treaty and rejected Bevin's request to quickly determine the German assets within Austria. He also opposed the establishment of an agreement regarding the centralization of German administration. During this morning's meeting, Bevin stated that he would urgently consider the United States' proposal to unify the German economy and clarified that Britain could not accept the Soviet Union's interpretation of the reparations portion of the Potsdam Agreement. Byrnes today continued to strongly advocate for the unification of the German economy and presented several sections from the Potsdam Declaration to support his argument. The four foreign ministers also discussed the issue of distributing Italian warships to Yugoslavia and Greece tonight. They agreed to hand over 5,000 tons of warships and auxiliary vessels to Yugoslavia, with 50% being warship tonnage. The details of the distribution would be decided by the naval committee. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also suggested that an Italian cruiser should be given to Greece to compensate for the Greek cruiser that was sunk, and it was agreed to transfer a medium-sized cruiser to Greece.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] Paris, 12th (Associated Press) - The four foreign ministers have approved the recommendations made by the Italian Colonial Territories Committee. According to the recommendations, Italy will relinquish all rights and titles to its African territories. The current regime in the territories should continue to exist until the final disposition is decided. The final disposition should be decided when the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union sign the peace treaty.</p>
<p>[US Information Service] Washington, 12th - Acting Secretary of State Acheson stated at a press conference today that the President's special aircraft, "Sacred Cow," has arrived in Paris to transport Secretary of State Byrnes back to the United States. He said: "I do not know what plan Byrnes has decided upon, but I expect that he will leave Paris tomorrow with advisors Senators Connally and Vandenberg and arrive in Washington on Sunday." Part of the Secretary of State's staff will remain in Paris to arrange the Peace Conference, which opens on the 29th of this month.</p>

<p>[Reuters] Paris, 12th - It is rumored that the British and French governments have resumed negotiations to conclude a treaty of alliance, and the accuracy of this rumor can be proven after Churchill delivers a speech in Metz, France, on the French border on Sunday afternoon. Churchill is going to Metz in a private capacity, but because he is the leader of the opposition party in the British Parliament, and it comes at a time when the Soviet Union's rejection of French policy towards Germany has greatly surprised the French, Churchill's speech is sure to have significant political significance. Since Molotov advocated for the establishment of a centralized German government at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, French public opinion has felt isolated. It is expected that Churchill's speech will make the French feel that at least Britain is expressing sympathy with them. Churchill will reiterate his previous remarks, expressing his belief that France has the ability to revive and acquire an important position in the international community. Regarding the Anglo-French alliance, British Foreign Secretary Bevin recently stated in the House of Commons that he was willing to conclude an alliance with France. Although this proposal has not yet begun to be implemented, it is expected that efforts will be made to make it a reality soon.</p>

Repayment of the remaining £1.5 million will also not be requested for the time being. Poland's non-military debt to Britain, including refugee accommodation fees paid by Britain, totals £32 million. The Polish government will first repay £3 million of this in gold, and the remaining £10 million will be repaid in annual installments after five years, spread over fifteen years.</p>
<h3 id="e58">The British Government is Confident in Securing Soviet Trust and Understanding; Bevin Declared in the House of Commons <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] London, 12th - During a short debate on Anglo-Soviet relations in the British House of Commons last night, Minister of State Hector McNeil stated that the British government deeply believes that it is possible to secure the trust of the Soviet Union and dispel its suspicions. The debate was initiated by Labour MP Aidan Esmond Crawley, who strongly advocated for close Anglo-Soviet relations. He solemnly pointed out the necessity of establishing close commercial relations between Britain and the Soviet Union and suggested the establishment of joint commercial companies in all areas where British and Soviet interests converge, in order to ensure cooperation and avoid conflict. McNeil, on behalf of the government, replied that the Labour government had sincerely sought cooperation with the Soviet Union in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter and believed that Britain would eventually gain the trust of the Soviet Union. When discussing the importance of economic factors in establishing lasting peace, he regretted that many European countries placed too much importance on the importance of borders. He stated: "Economic factors cannot be separated from political factors, because if countries adopt policies of economic nationalism, it will inevitably lead to poverty and unrest, and then inevitably lead to war." He believed that a good understanding and concerted action between Britain and the Soviet Union could never be achieved by any system of diplomatic haggling or the establishment of spheres of influence. It must rely on compliance with the various principles of the United Nations Charter. He finally asked the members to recall the unpleasant experiences the Soviet Union had with Western democracies before the war, and it was natural for the Soviet Union today to suspect whether the new democracies outside the Soviet Union were genuine or fraudulent. Britain is eager to prove to the Soviet Union that Britain has the sincerity to dispel suspicions.

<p>[US Information Service] Washington, 12th - When Acting Secretary of State Acheson was interviewed by reporters today, he was asked about the news of the Soviet Union receiving former German property in Bulgaria. The Acting Secretary of State stated that he had seen this report, but the State Department had not yet received official information about this Soviet action. He was asked what attitude the United States would take towards this matter. Acheson explained that the United States' relationship with Bulgaria was different from its relationship with Hungary. Acheson asserted: There is a common point between Bulgaria and Hungary, namely, the Declaration of the United Nations on January 18, 1943, regarding the forced transfer of materials, is applicable. Acheson explained: The United States believes that the ownership of property seized by the enemy from nationals or companies of the Allied countries still belongs to the Allied countries or their nationals. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's view is that property received by Germany is considered German property. Acheson further explained: The United States does not demand that genuine German property be returned to the Bulgarian government, but the situation in Austria is different because the Moscow Declaration of 1943 called for a free and independent Austria. Therefore, the United States is willing to discuss with the Allied countries and Austria the return of part of the German property acquired by the United States to the Austrian government.</p>

<p>[United Press] New York, 12th - According to the results of a public opinion poll conducted by Fortune magazine, more than half of the Americans who participated in the poll believe that the Soviet Union wants to expand its influence in the United States through the dissemination of international communism and believe that the Soviet Union is greedy for world resources beyond the amount of fair distribution. The Soviet Union wants to control the world as much as possible, but the United States should maintain friendship with it. 49% of those surveyed believe that there is a good chance of avoiding another major war in 25 to 30 years, but 41% believe that a major war will occur during this period. In this survey, 65.2% supported the continuation of the draft system.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 12th Dispatch] Indian National Congress President Nehru presented a report to the party's general assembly today, expressing dissatisfaction with France and other countries enjoying territorial rights within India. He stated that France and other foreign countries cannot continue to retain territory in free India, but these countries can continue to maintain their culture in India. Therefore, the Pondicherry district (French colony in India) can become an area of French culture. In fact, we should welcome this, as we aspire to develop cultural relations with France. In short, the disposal of foreign colonies will be decided by the local residents themselves.</p>

<p>Many Soldiers in Europe Have Venereal Diseases</p>
<p>[United Press, Yokohama, 12th Dispatch] The commander of the US Eighth Army occupying Japan, Eichelberger, issued a warning to his troops on the 22nd of last month, stating that US military crimes are increasing and strict measures will be taken to stop them. The contents of the warning were announced today. It is said that the unlawful behavior of the US military has provoked retaliation from the Japanese, which endangers the occupation mission. Reports of US military crimes have recently increased, including individuals or groups beating Japanese people, breaking into homes to steal pocket money from poor residents, destroying furniture and windows, and assaulting women on roads and in homes. The arrogant attitude of some US soldiers has led to widespread reports, which I believe to be true, and will be severely punished.</p>

<p>[United Press, Hungarian Capital, 12th Dispatch] The devaluation of the Hungarian currency, the "Pengő," has reached an unbelievable level, requiring 500,000,000,000,000,000,000 Pengős to equal one US dollar. Before the war, one Pengő was worth 29.12 US cents. The Ministry of Finance ordered today that the current Pengő be withdrawn and replaced with the "Index Pengő," also known as the "Tax Pengő," which was issued in January of this year and initially used for tax payments. The value of the Index Coupon is based on various other indices, with 6.5 million exchanging for one US dollar. Officials hope that the Index Coupon will remain stable until August 1, when a new currency, the "Forint," will be issued, the value of which has not yet been announced.</p>

<p>—Our Newspaper Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing—</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the sound of bright bells echoed over the Hudson River. The old pastor of the Claremont Church, with his sparse white hair, prayed for the devout men and women. He said, "Today, we Americans have inexhaustible material pleasures, but we have neglected a reasonable spiritual life. God has given us infinite grace, but we have let God down?" The old pastor's words touched the hearts of every American! A Life magazine reporter wrote a dispatch back to the country, saying that American children were participating in the black market trade in Shanghai. American reporters in Paris wired back reports of American children drinking, committing violence, and engaging in love rivalries. The landlady's child, who is still stationed in France, said, "The child once returned home after being discharged, but less than two months later, he voluntarily re-enlisted and went to Europe." The old lady asked me, "What charm do European girls have? What has captivated my child?" On the day that General MacArthur narrowly escaped an accident, every newspaper in New York carried the headline of a $663,000 fraud case. The photo of the fraudster, William朋吉朋, stood side by side with MacArthur's portrait. This big fraudster was caught in New York. "In just three months, it was $663,000!" New York newspaper readers, on the subway, in the office, and in coffee shops, all read this news very seriously. They could ignore the news of the Paris Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, because those meetings were "government affairs," or even "Bernanos' affairs."</p>
<p>Daughter's Lightning Marriage - Angered the Master of Humor</p>
<p>Similarly, the story of Miss Lin Rus, the daughter of Lin Yutang, eloping was published on the third page of the New York Daily News with a large headline. The young lady eloped to Boston to marry a 26-year-old Lieutenant Bi'e of the US Naval Aviation Corps in order to avoid her father's opposition. Lin Yutang called them both from New York: he was unwilling to bless them because he opposed any "blitzkrieg marriage." The American Evening News, which usually doesn't sell very well, broke sales records in two days because it published a special article: "How I Killed Mussolini." Colonel Fan Leo was an Italian Communist. When Mussolini's Republican Fascist regime in northern Italy collapsed at the end of April last year, Fan Leo rushed from Milan to Tango, snatched Mussolini and his mistress, 巴蒂湘, from another unit, and then used a jeep to transport them to a secluded town, where they were machine-gunned to death without trial. The disorganization of the marriage system in the United States is rare in any country. In Huston, Montana, a 74-year-old man named Han Dun married for the first time when his wife died, divorced for the second time, and recently married for the third time on Easter. The bride, Vina, was only 16 years old. Five days later, news reporters reported Vina's disappearance. It turned out that the 74-year-old Han Dun was a landowner with more than 800 acres of land. The condition of their marriage was that the bride could enjoy a certain percentage of the land after Han Dun died. But because there was no "spiritual life," Han Dun did not die, and the bride eloped alone.</p>
<p>Only Two Reporters Needed - No Shortage of News</p>
<p>Yellow news newspapers only need to send two field reporters every day to guard the prosecutor's office of the New York Court, and the newspaper's news sources can be inexhaustible and inexhaustible. With a large metropolis of 7.7 million people, social order is inherently difficult to maintain, and Americans admire their court prosecutor's office. American lawyers believe that the New York prosecutor's office is a miracle in judicial history. Americans say: If Mr. Dewey had not laid the foundation for this prosecution system back then, how chaotic would it be if we had to rely on a few police officers to maintain social order now? There are now as many as 70 judges, 10 accountants, 10 investigation experts, 60 plainclothes detectives, and more than 100 other staff members in the New York prosecutor's office. The prosecutor's office has the power to direct the police throughout New York City and prosecutes more than 40,000 cases each year. Among these 40,000 cases, there are stories of joy and sorrow, stories of murder and robbery, and terrible crises lurking in society. A sixteen-year-old child in the Bronx (across the river from New York) beat a fifty-six-year-old woman to death simply because he "hated her to the bone." Another fourteen-year-old child took care of a neighbor's baby. The baby cried, and the child suffocated her, for only two minutes, and the three-year-old baby died. The sixteen-year-old and fourteen-year-old children were brought to court one after another. Ingersoll, the editor-in-chief of the New York afternoon newspaper, wrote an editorial on a full page: How does the law judge a fourteen-year-old murderer? He said: This is not a simple legal issue, but the most serious educational issue in the United States.</p>
<p>Chalk Master's Life is Bitter - Education is in a Slump</p>
<p>Observing (Observing?) initially called out "American Education Bankruptcy." A Mr. Harlan Rogan loudly exclaimed: "American education now uses textbooks from the 1914 era and teaching methods from fifty years ago!" According to the American friends I have come into contact with, all those with intelligence and talent are unwilling to engage in education. The biggest reason is that the teachers' living conditions are too low, which is not enough to burden the life of a family. According to the old statistics of 1942 and 1943: the average annual salary of rural school teachers in the United States was 1,018 yuan, the average annual salary of middle school teachers was 1,901 yuan, and the average annual salary of university lecturers was 1,872 yuan. The annual salary of shipbuilding workers reached 3,375 yuan, and the annual salary of printing workers reached 3,249 yuan. After the end of the war, the statistical figures may have changed somewhat, but the harsh life of teachers in the United States, a country that is first in industry and commerce, is an indisputable fact. Because talents are eliminated instead, those who are unqualified fill the ranks of the American education sector. A few days ago, a female teacher in a rural elementary school near New York allowed a boy to go out and spend the night, and taught him various indecent behaviors, which aroused the accusations of parents throughout the village. American movies penetrate every corner of rural society, but the education that movies give to children is nothing more than love and assassination! Many people say that American university education is more lacking than before. The number of students has increased, but the teaching materials of professors are still the same old blueprints that have not changed for many years. A Chinese scholar recently came to New York because he had been sealed in Sichuan for many years and wanted to find some new American books on related subjects to supplement them, but he was very disappointed: "The textbooks used by American universities today are still the same set I used when I studied in the United States." But no university administrators are pessimistic. Wartime is an abnormal phenomenon. After the war, they believe that the golden age of academic culture will blossom and bear fruit in the United States. European exiled professors and first-class scholars have all been exiled in the United States. The United States, this great melting pot of the world, will create a brand-new road for the academic world throughout the world. (Sent from New York on June 14)</p>

<p>[Our Paper Report] After the Central Airlines Shanghai-Peiping flight "No. 15" crashed in Jinan, the company's chief of flight operations, Chen Wenkuan, personally piloted a plane full of medicine to Jinan yesterday morning to investigate the cause of the accident. Director Chen is a well-known pilot in the country and the first Chinese to fly over the "Hump." After the news of the accident on the 12th evening, Chen decided to personally investigate and flew the company's C-46 "No. 21" to Jinan at 11:40 yesterday morning. Assistant pilot Li Fei, radio operators Jiang Yuchun and Chen Wenjin, and three mechanics accompanied him. Before taking off from Longhua Airport yesterday morning, Director Chen Wenkuan told our reporter that the climate and visibility in Jinan on the 12th were excellent, and the engine had been carefully inspected in Shanghai. The pilot, Shen Huade, had served in the US Air Force and had experience, so it was unexpected that the engine would catch fire after safely flying more than 1,000 kilometers, which is worthy of study. Chen is scheduled to return to Shanghai at 2:00 p.m. today, and a detailed cause of the accident will be released upon arrival.</p>
<p>[Further News] It is reported that the pilot Shen Huade, who was seriously injured in the crash of "No. 15," died that night due to his injuries.

These medicines could have been sent to Jinan that night, but several major pharmacies in the city refused to sell the medicines to Central Airlines because it was too late. This was delayed until yesterday morning before they could be purchased.</p>
<p>[Further News] Director Chen Wenkuan's "No. 21" plane, which flew to Jinan for investigation, arrived in Jinan at 2:20 p.m. that day.

<p>The city's third hurricane, after landing in northern Fujian the day before yesterday, will soon disappear. According to a report from the Sino-American Meteorological Bureau, a major hurricane of Category 10 or higher was discovered north of Guam on the afternoon of the 12th. The US Navy immediately sent planes to Guam to investigate, and the results confirmed that the hurricane was traveling northwest at a speed of 15 knots per hour at 14.9 degrees north latitude and 137.0 degrees east longitude yesterday afternoon. The strength of the wind is the strongest seen this year. If the wind direction and speed remain unchanged, it will invade the Philippines in four days, and this city will inevitably be hit head-on.</p>
<p>Obstructing the Resumption of Import and Export Cargo Ships</p>
<p>The hurricane that arose in the South Pacific has now disappeared. Cargo ships that were unable to export due to wind obstruction the day before yesterday, such as Taikoo &amp; Co.'s Hanyang Wheel and Shandong Wheel, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Hesheng Wheel (all sailing to Hong Kong), China Merchants Bureau's Peide Wheel (sailing to Guangdong), and Jinhai Wheel (sailing to Taiwan), Dalae &amp; Co.'s Malkas Wheel, etc., a total of six ships, all cleared customs and exported yesterday. In addition, all ships that were unable to import due to wind obstruction the day before yesterday also imported yesterday.</p>

<p>[Our Paper Report] At 1:50 p.m. yesterday, a collision between two ambulances occurred at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road. The Central Fire Department received a call from the Zhabei Police Station that a citizen was suffering from a sudden illness, so ambulance No. 81, driven by Xu Jinfu, went to the scene. Unexpectedly, just as it was about to turn north at the throwing ball field, an ambulance from the Sino-American Hospital, driven by Lu Xuming, carrying a Russian patient, Bai Liqie, and Bai's mother and younger brother, Haiqie Tuo, was coming from Nanjing Road from west to east. The two vehicles failed to yield to each other at the intersection, resulting in ambulance No. 81 colliding with the front wheels of the Sino-American Hospital's ambulance. As a result, the Sino-American Hospital's ambulance overturned, and the patient in the car was also injured. The traffic in the area was blocked for a long time after the accident. The Fire Department then dispatched another vehicle to send the Russian patient to Gongji Hospital for treatment. The police are investigating the responsibility of the two drivers.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Today is French National Day - Overseas Chinese Celebrate, Knight Invested <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Today is French National Day. The French expatriate community here will hold a celebration to commemorate it. At 10:00 AM, the French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Pélissier, will hold a reception at the French Consulate on Jinling Road to entertain all French expatriates in Shanghai. At 10:30 AM, Mayor Wu and his wife, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries, will be invited. At 11:30 AM, a group of French expatriates will gather for a celebratory meal at the French Club on Avenue Haig (now Huaihai Road). At 1:00 PM, there will also be a gathering at the former French Club on Route Mercier (now Maoming Road). At 3:30 PM, Consul General Pélissier will award the highest French knighthood, the Legion of Honor, to British citizen Eric Davis on board the French warship "La Grandière" (i.e., "The Great"). Mr. Davis has resided in Shanghai for many years and is an engineer with many French friends. During the occupation of Shanghai, when French citizens were being arrested by the Japanese invaders, Mr. Davis repeatedly risked his life to communicate with his French friends and assist them, sparing no effort. Later, he himself was arrested by the Japanese army and imprisoned in the Bridgehead Building, and later moved to the Jiangwan concentration camp, where he was subjected to brutal torture in an attempt to make him reveal the secret movements of the French. However, Mr. Davis endured the suffering and refused to disclose any information, resulting in him being crippled. After the victory, he was released, and the French have great respect for him, admiring him and calling him "Knight."</p>
<h3 id="e85">Two German Overseas Chinese Who Fled - Arrested and Sent to Concentration Camp <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] When the first group of German expatriates in this city were sent back to their country on the 7th of this month, eight people escaped. According to an investigation by the German Expatriate Management Committee, two of them, Mr. Schott and Mrs. Heilborn, have been arrested and imprisoned in the Jiangwan Qimei Road concentration camp. Mrs. Heilborn claims to have divorced Mr. Heilborn. According to the investigation, Mrs. Heilborn is in her thirties, acts very mysteriously, and her lifestyle is quite unrestrained. Two others, Mr. Zippel and Mr. Borkeber, are reportedly hiding in the United States. Mr. Weisslandner and Mr. Klandt are hiding in Nanjing. Mr. Waffmeister claimed to have been granted permission by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to remain in Shanghai, but when the second notice was delivered, he was out, so the situation is unknown. His current residence has also been sealed off, and he went to the German Expatriate Management Committee to request its recovery. The whereabouts of Mr. Herschke are unknown. Mr. Laurence, who attempted suicide unsuccessfully, is now permitted to remain in Shanghai. Currently, there are approximately forty German expatriates, men, women, and children, detained in the concentration camp. There is still no news regarding the second batch of repatriations.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Some restaurants and cafes in this city, due to the lifting of the curfew, have petitioned the Municipal Police Bureau to request an extension of business hours. However, the Police Bureau believes that extending the business hours of restaurants and entertainment venues is not yet appropriate, so all requests have been denied. Furthermore, the Jin Gu Hotel on Xizang Road in this city has frequently been operating beyond the permitted hours. Despite warnings from the Police Bureau, it continued to do so. Yesterday, it was ordered to close for three days as a disciplinary measure.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Pork Article - Liberated Pigs Come Rolling In, Shanghai Smells of Pork Everywhere <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Meat (referring to pork) should be placed in the most important position in terms of food. The famous line from the sage, "For three months, he did not know the taste of meat," has been passed down through the ages and is still widely recited. This is enough to illustrate that "meat" is indeed a tempting noun for human life.</p>
<p>The fortunate people of Shanghai are truly blessed when it comes to enjoying meat. Look, every corner of Shanghai is filled with the smell of meat every day.</p>
<p>According to reliable statistics, approximately 50,000 pigs are sacrificed each month to "tribute" to the citizens of Shanghai, averaging around 1,600 per day. Can you say that this is a small number? Of course, if we make further calculations: assuming each pig weighs 100 jin (approximately 50 kg), and Shanghai has 3.5 million people, the average allocation per person is still less than 1 liang (approximately 50 grams) of pork. This trivial amount is not worth mentioning, is it?</p>
<p>Don't just talk about how much pork there is; diners only know that pork tastes good in their mouths, but who knows the sour and bitter taste in the aroma? The source of pork is not easy, and the situation of merchants is also difficult.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where industry and commerce gather. Farmers in the suburbs also raise pigs. Except for a small number of people from Jiangbei (north of the Yangtze River) who raise pigs in the western part of Shanghai to supply the market, 95% of the supply must be sourced from the pig-producing areas north and south of the Huai River and the Jiangbei region.</p>
<p>The pork we usually eat in Shanghai falls into two categories: (1) Huai pigs (also known as train pigs because they are transported to Shanghai by rail), whose origin is in areas north and south of the Huai River, such as Xuzhou, Shangqiu, Suxian, Mingguang, and Bengbu. (2) Jiangbei pigs, whose origin is in areas such as Nantong, Huaiyin, Rugao, Taixing, Gaoyou, and Yangzhou. Currently, due to transportation and other factors, the supply of Jiangbei pigs is lower than that of Huai pigs. Jiang pigs account for 45%, and Huai pigs account for 55%.</p>
<p>Most of the above-mentioned production areas belong to the Chinese Communist "Liberated Areas". Merchants who sell must go through hardships to purchase pigs and enter "foreign territory". Banknotes are not commonly used in the Communist areas. The purchase of pigs in Jiangbei mostly adopts a barter system, exchanging miscellaneous grains for piglets, which is simply a "spectacular" sight in the market of the modern century. This method is very difficult for merchants because the prices in the two regions fluctuate, and if the prices are not right, they will lose money. Taking the recent pork market prices as an example, merchants are actually losing 20,000 yuan per pig.</p>
<p>Merchants transport the pigs to Shanghai through pig brokers, who then sell them to pork shops. Between the multiple transfers, plus more than a dozen other direct or indirect taxes and fees, the price of pork naturally increases.</p>
<p>It is the summer season, and people have reduced their appetite for pork, and the pork market is gradually declining. The source is not easy, the cost is high, the taxes and fees are heavy, and business is not as good as before the war. Pork merchants shake their heads and sigh.</p>
<p>National affairs are unpredictable, and the clouds of war are unpredictable. Some people are wondering: if a war breaks out and the source of pigs is cut off, will Shanghai experience a "meat shortage"? Pork merchants say: the magic lies in people's ingenuity, Shanghai people don't need to worry, there is plenty of pork. (Jiang Jun)</p>

<p>Mao Yisheng Goes to Hangzhou to Inspect the Qiantang Project</p>
<p>Hou, head of the Engineering Planning Team, and Du De, chief engineer, went to Nanjing a few days ago to discuss the reorganization of national transportation with the transportation authorities. They returned to Shanghai by plane on the 12th. Vice-head Mao Yisheng went to Hangzhou yesterday to inspect the Qiantang project. Reports from the railway and highway groups of the team have been drafted, and the report from the port group is also about to be completed. Regarding the restoration plans for Qingdao and Lianyungang ports, Mr. Liang, the secretary-general of the team, told reporters: (1) Qingdao faces a deep-water, ice-free port. During the German lease period, the port built six or seven large and small docks, as well as an inner harbor dock specifically for wooden boats and fishing boats to dock. Engineer Shao Fuwu's impression after visiting this time was very good. According to his report: the port's wartime losses were not very heavy. Only slight repairs are needed to restore it to its former scale, and it can become the primary good port on the coast. (2) Lianyungang is very close to the old course of the Yellow River and is affected by siltation throughout the year. Ocean-going ships cannot dock. The current scale of reconstruction is limited by natural conditions and cannot be started. In the future, it can only be used as a supplementary port, restoring the standard that allowed 3,000-ton ships to dock in the past. As for the freight transportation of the Longhai Railway, it can be rerouted through the ports of Qingdao and Pukou.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The sensational Taishan Apartment murder case has been heard three times by the District Court, and the trial has concluded. At 10:30 AM yesterday morning, Judge Cao Zuwei ascended the court to announce the verdict: "Lin Buwu, jointly committing murder, sentenced to death, deprived of civil rights for life. Possessing military-use pistol bullets without permission and without a proper reason, sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Receiving stolen goods, sentenced to eight months of imprisonment, to be executed with the death penalty, deprived of civil rights for life. Wang Zhengzhong, jointly committing murder, sentenced to death, deprived of civil rights for life. Possessing military-use pistol bullets without permission and without a proper reason, sentenced to eight months of imprisonment. Theft, sentenced to two years of imprisonment, to be executed with the death penalty, deprived of civil rights for life. One pistol (Yu Ning brand, No. 4160) with eleven bullets, one revolver (S.W. brand, No. 203) with eight bullets, thirty-one rifle bullet heads, and one hundred and twenty-two other various military bullets are to be confiscated." After hearing the verdict, the two criminals immediately changed their calm attitude when they appeared in court, and their faces suddenly turned pale, and they bowed their heads and said nothing. Judge Cao explained: "The defendants in this case are both intellectuals. If they could have stepped onto the right path, they would have been able to accomplish something. Now that they have strayed onto the wrong path, according to legal principles, their crimes cannot be reduced. If they do not agree with the verdict, they can appeal to the High Court." The two criminals still did not say a word, and were escorted to the detention center by bailiffs. When the verdict was announced, the wife of the principal offender, Lin Buwu, was also in the courtroom, holding a child who was not yet one year old. The child was ignorant and still smiled at people, opened his mouth and waved his hands, looking innocent. But Lin's wife did not show any emotional expression when she heard the verdict.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Handling Enemy and Puppet Property - Liu Gongyun Reports on Work Progress - Received Materials Exceeding One Trillion Yuan <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Liu Gongyun, Director of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region, held a second press conference at the bureau's conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. During the conference, he gave detailed reports on the general reception and handling of enemy and puppet property since its establishment. Mr. Liu first stated that the reception process was complex and multifaceted, and that it has now come to an end, but has not completely stopped.</p>
<p>According to the regulations of the Executive Yuan, the original inventory and the transfer inventory of various agencies should be consulted during the reception. However, because the bureau was established relatively late, the original reception inventories of the agencies that arrived earlier had either been lost or had omissions in the reception, making it difficult to verify the reception and inventory. Even the inventories that had been received had inconsistent content, with different product names, quantities, and units, making it necessary to carefully organize and verify them. As of recently, more than 2,600 inventories have been received. In addition, the Japanese Liaison Department was ordered to create a transfer inventory and compare it with the reception inventories of various agencies in detail. This work can be completed in the next week, and the exact amount of materials received will be clear. As for the leakage of materials, if it occurs after the reception, the bureau will bear full responsibility.</p>
<p>Received Materials</p>
<p>The total value of the received materials is of great concern to all parties. However, I am responsible for explaining today that it has already exceeded one trillion yuan, and the materials and traitorous properties outside of Shanghai, which are approximately one hundred billion yuan, are not included in this figure. Most of these materials are textiles, dyes, real estate, warehouses, docks, factories, gold, silver, cash, furniture, etc., and those received from the Japanese side account for approximately 50-60%, with the remainder being the property of puppet organizations and a small number seized by the investigation teams based on confidential reports.</p>
<p>Investigation Work</p>
<p>The investigation work is the most complained about and troublesome work for the bureau. The investigation teams have received a total of 6,800 confidential reports, and 2,500 cases have been accepted and seized. A portion is still being cleared. A portion of the funds of the informers have not yet been issued. In the future, reports of traitors' property will still be accepted and investigated jointly by the bureau and the court. As for the puppet properties, they were handled by the Military Statistics Bureau before the bureau arrived, and have now been gradually transferred to the bureau. The tally has been completed recently, totaling more than 270 cases. In addition, the bureau has seized a considerable number of cases based on confidential reports. Regarding the handling of traitors' property, the handling bureau and the court have agreed on cooperation methods, and are submitting them to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for the standard for deducting living expenses for the families of traitors whose property has been confiscated, the High Court is currently requesting instructions from the Judicial Administration Department. The department will have an interpretation of the laws on deducting living expenses in a short period of time, and the standard can be determined.</p>
<p>Handling of Auctions</p>
<p>The initial purpose of handling the auctions of enemy and puppet materials was to stabilize prices in the city. It achieved some results in the early stages. However, due to the small number of daily necessities in the received materials, the materials for sale gradually decreased. The prices in the city rose rapidly again due to other reasons. The bureau changed the flat sale method and entrusted various agencies, such as the China Textile Corporation for textiles and the Grain Administration for grain, to auction them separately. Although there were considerable achievements, it was not completely satisfactory. Moreover, as the national treasury needed funds, it was decided to open warehouses for large-scale sales, auctioning important materials and selling minor and scattered materials. A Committee for Auctioning Investigation Materials was formed to handle the materials seized by the investigation teams. A Committee for Auctioning Factory Materials will also be formed to be responsible for the auction of materials in the factories in order to increase government revenue and empty the warehouses. According to reports, half of the warehouses managed by the customs have been emptied. Most of these warehouses are privately owned and have been returned. They have been rented out by the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. As of today, materials worth 283 billion yuan have been auctioned, of which more than 100 billion yuan were sold in Shanghai, more than 20 billion yuan were gold, and more than 90 billion yuan were textiles, purchased by the Ministry of Military Affairs. Recently, the Executive Yuan stipulated that the bureau must increase the amount of money turned over to the national treasury by 200 billion yuan within six months to reach the amount of 500 billion yuan. If the city's credit is tight, auctions will be more difficult, so whether there is certainty is difficult to predict. The bureau will do its best to do it. In addition, the bureau has decided to adopt a low-price public method for auctioning materials or factories in the future, which will make auctions easier.</p>
<p>Review of Property Rights</p>
<p>The most troublesome matter in the bureau is the review of property rights. The Review Committee holds three meetings per week, and has held 103 meetings so far. What is discussed is the ownership of private property, with factories, houses, and ships accounting for the majority. The review process must be approved by the Executive Yuan in the end. Regarding property rights cases, the bureau has handled more than 2,000 cases belonging to factories and more than 4,900 cases belonging to houses, totaling more than 7,000 cases. If these cases are handled too loosely, outsiders will think there is corruption; if they are too strict, the owners will appeal to the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan. Secondly, there is the evaluation part. The evaluation of all materials and factories, and the determination of the reward money for confidential reports, are all decided by the second group of the bureau. If the evaluation is too high, outsiders will not accept it; if it is too low, the government will suffer losses, so this work is also extremely heavy.</p>
<p>Sale of Factories</p>
<p>Eighty-six units of factories have been sold (all small factories). The government stipulates that all factories received, except for those allocated to the China Textile Corporation and the China [missing text], must be auctioned. However, the government has decided to allocate eight or nine of the factories to factories relocating from the rear. Afterwards, Mr. Liu answered reporters' questions: (1) The bureau had less than [missing text] before this year, but it does not have to wait until all the materials have been sold to close. The internal groups are actively downsizing. (2) The Reception and Review Team will arrive in Shanghai around the 20th of this month. The bureau will provide all [missing text] and original inventories for reference. (3) The Social Bureau Director [missing text] has discussed with me twice about labor-management and government-cooperative factories, requesting that two factories be allocated [missing text] from the received factories. The principle has not yet been determined. [Missing text] The sale of received houses is the government's original plan. The bureau has received more than 2,000 rounds of [missing text] houses, but every round is inhabited, and there are very few empty ones. It is now planned to start selling them in two weeks. The government has the greatest determination to order everyone living in the property to move out within a time limit when it is sold, guaranteeing that the buyer will not pay until the house is cleared. 300 buildings will be auctioned first, and the [missing text] size and low price of these 300 buildings will be announced in advance. Purchasers must apply to the Central Trust Bureau before publicly auctioning.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Ye Jiqing, wife of Li Shiqun, the chief of the puppet 76th Special Agent Headquarters, underwent a second trial at the High Court yesterday afternoon. Ye wore a Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants, barefoot in black soft leather flat shoes, and wore a bun, but her hair was already gray. According to her testimony: she was listed as an accountant at the "76th Headquarters", but had no salary or work. She only lived at the 76th Headquarters for a few months and then moved out, and did not interfere in special agent matters. As for serving as a member of the puppet Economic Committee, it was because Mrs. Chen Qun was humiliated on the road, and my husband had me listed on the Economic Committee to receive a pass, which made travel easier. Li Shiqun was the deputy director of the [missing text] headquarters, and the director was Ding Mocun. At that time, Wu Kaixian was arrested by the Japanese, and I interceded for him, so Li found a way to release him and return him to Chongqing. Li later died in September of the 32nd year because he repeatedly rescued underground workers and was dissatisfied by the Japanese. After the adjournment, Ye requested to meet with her daughter, and the judge granted her request. The case was adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Wang Manyun, who held various puppet positions, was tried in High Court yesterday. Wang is 42 years old and from Hangzhou. In August of the 28th year, he served as a member of the puppet Central Executive Committee and Deputy Minister of the puppet Ministry of Social Affairs. In March of the 29th year, he transferred to the position of Vice Minister of the puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Mines. In July of the 30th year, he was transferred to the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the puppet Qingxiang Committee, specializing in suppressing my underground comrades. In September of the 31st year, he was reassigned as Vice Minister of the puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration. In the autumn of the 32nd year, he was transferred to the position of Director-General of the puppet Executive Yuan Qingxiang Affairs Bureau, responsible for suppressing anti-Japanese elements until the victory. However, Wang argued in court yesterday that: in the 31st year, Wu Kaixian was arrested in Shanghai, and he helped rescue him. He joined the puppet government under orders to cover for underground work. The case was adjourned for another hearing.</p>

In order to quickly adapt to the situation, the Shanghai Regional Distribution Committee was organized, with Li Bojia as the chairman, to be responsible for the autumn national standard textbook printing, storage, transportation, quantitative distribution, and contract negotiations with educational administrative agencies in Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Fujian, Jiangxi, and other provinces and cities. Recently, due to a sharp increase in costs in the past six months, the selling prices of all books have been submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval and are being sold at 48 times the price. The office has organized supply groups in various regions and has decided to adopt joint printing and sales. The country is concentrating on six locations to jointly print, distribute quantitatively according to the educational statistics of each province and city (the Ministry of Education has recently made precise statistics, which are more reliable than the number of books requested by each educational agency), and jointly sell through the branch offices of each province and city using a pre-order method. If this method can be promoted with the cooperation of the educational departments of each province, it can reduce costs, the price of books, and avoid book shortages.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Amateur and Professional Sports; Removing Boundaries <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>French Sports Organizations Urge Government Nationalization</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] Various French sports organizations today requested the government to remove the boundaries between professional and amateur sports, which, in effect, would amount to nationalizing French sports. The resolution of the organizations advocates that French sports champions who are admired should be known as national athletes and supported by the state. It also requests that in national sports competitions, whether amateur or professional athletes, as well as coaches and instructors, should be allowed to participate. The distinction between amateur and professional originated in England, where amateur sports were generally favored by the privileged class, and those lacking financial resources were at a disadvantage. Obtaining the championship required rigorous training, and the ticket revenue from commercialized sports put amateur athletes at an unfair disadvantage.</p>

<p>In the Future, Revenue from Charity Football Matches Must Consult Their Distribution Methods</p>
<p>Regarding the China Welfare Fund Raising Committee's invitation to South China to come to Shanghai for a charity match, South China may have the possibility of going north, but due to the problem of the opposing team, it will likely fall through. As for the rumors that Qing and Dong teams intend to participate in the charity match, according to the person in charge of Qingbai authorities who firmly stated to the Huadong News Agency yesterday, the football season has passed, and most of the team members are not used to running in the hot sun. People are not cattle or horses, and cannot be forced, and some players are also leaving Shanghai. As for Li Chongshi, one of the Qingbai organizers, although he sympathizes with the charity match, Li cannot force the players to take the field either. He also said: According to what he knows, Donghua is also unable to participate in the charity match for the above reasons. It is also heard that Dong and Qing teams have recently indicated that in the future, when inviting the teams to participate in charity matches, they must explain the exact use of the revenue to the teams beforehand, and the two teams must consult on the distribution methods, otherwise, even during the season, the two teams will refuse to take the field.</p>

<p>At around 11:00 AM on the 27th of last month, the Relief Administration hired a lighter, carrying 290 bales of cotton, to sail into the Huangpu River.

<p>The Municipal Civil Affairs Department recently replied to a resident of Jiaotong University who inquired about the district office filling out the household license, which is based on the resident's household registration. The resident's household registration, except for the first investigation by government personnel, is usually based on the resident's application. Faculty and staff of your school should directly apply for entry registration with the Bao office in their place of residence, so that the district office can fill out the household license accordingly. The National Identity Card must also be filled out by the resident and the application form submitted to the Bao office for processing. As for blank application forms, you can inquire at the nearest district office or Bao office."</p>
<h3 id="e142">Household Registration Implementation Details (Answers to Questions) <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Q: What is identity registration? Since there is already origin registration, why is identity registration necessary?</p>
<p>A: Origin registration confirms a person's origin; identity registration certifies a person's status in private law. At the same time, the gain, loss, or change of identity may change one's origin. For example, acquiring the status of a spouse through marriage means the wife should take the husband's origin as her origin. Losing spousal status through divorce requires changing one's origin. Therefore, there is origin registration, and there must also be identity registration.</p>
<p>Q: How many types of identity registration are there?</p>
<p>A: There are eight types of identity registration:</p>
<p>(1) Birth registration – for children born and found abandoned children.</p>
<p>(2) Acknowledgment registration – acknowledging children born out of wedlock requires acknowledgment registration.</p>
<p>(3) Adoption registration – adopting other people's children requires adoption registration.</p>
<p>(4) Marriage registration – those who marry must register their marriage.</p>
<p>(5) Divorce registration – those who divorce must register their divorce.</p>
<p>(6) Death registration – death or declaration of death must be registered.</p>
<p>(7) Guardianship registration.</p>
<p>(8) Inheritance registration.</p>
<p>Q: For the six types above—birth, death or declaration of death, marriage, divorce, adoption, acknowledgment—on the one hand, it is necessary to apply for household registration or deregistration, and here it is also necessary to apply for identity registration. Isn't that two application procedures?</p>
<p>A: No, it's called one application, two registrations. Article 21, paragraph 2, of the Household Registration Implementation Rules stipulates: "If the same matter involves two or more registrations, two copies of the application form must still be filled out." Therefore, as long as you apply for various identity registrations, the registration agency can make household registration or deregistration based on this after receiving the identity registration.</p>
<p>The Thirty-Second District Office wrote to the Civil Affairs Department, asking: In the "address" column of the birth registration application form, does it refer to the address of the registration obligor, or the address of the person concerned? It is not clearly stipulated, so it is often confusing when filling it out. According to Article 39 of Chapter 6 of the amended Household Registration Law, "Children born in hospitals, prisons, or other public places, if their parents cannot apply for registration, the hospital director, prison warden, or other public place manager shall be the registration obligor." There are two questions: (1) If the column is the address of the person concerned, it will be impossible to find the registration obligor for inquiries in the future when questions arise regarding the registration. (2) If the column is the address of the registration obligor, the form will not be able to identify the location of the person concerned. Please provide an explanation.</p>
<p>Answer: (1) The address column under the name of the registration obligor on the birth registration application form refers to the address of the registration obligor. (2) Those who apply for birth registration other than parents, guardians, or cohabitants should indicate the address of the person concerned in the "Remarks" column for investigation purposes.</p>

<p>(Article 27) Changes, corrections, or cancellations of registration shall be recorded in the "Registered Items" column of the household registration book. If the paper is insufficient, the original column shall be labeled with a note and affixed with the name stamp of the household registration director.</p>
<p>The provisions of Article 25, paragraph 2, shall apply mutatis mutandis to those registered using cards.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 National Identity Card</p>
<p>(Article 28) Counties that issue national identity cards shall prepare them in a unified manner, send them to the township offices, and issue them on a regular basis after household registration.</p>
<p>When issuing national identity cards, the township offices shall assign numbers, complete the inspection and filling, submit them to the county government for review and stamping, and then return them to the township offices for distribution to the recipients.</p>
<p>Those who replace the national identity card with a household registration transcript shall be subject to the provisions of the national identity card mutatis mutandis.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Domestic Production Costs Exceed Foreign Prices; The Inspector General of Customs Greatly Concerned; Not Enough Trade Development Customs Officers to Handle; Nothing Heard Regarding Adjustment of Tariffs <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Our reporter recently visited Mr. Li Du, the Inspector General of Customs, and asked him several questions about customs matters, to which he graciously provided answers one by one. The main points are summarized below: (1) Regarding customs revenue matters, Mr. Li said that the situation is very good, with figures increasing rapidly month by month, exceeding the original expectations, but the exact figures could not be disclosed to the public. (2) Regarding rumors of adjusting import and export tariff rates, he declined to comment and said that he had not heard anything about it, stating that this was a matter for the Tariff Committee. (3) Regarding whether there would be any improvements in the current customs administrative measures, Mr. Li said that there are no special improvement measures that can be announced at present, but he pays close attention to customs administration and constantly seeks improvements. The most difficult thing recently is the shortage of customs personnel. On the one hand, Shanghai's foreign trade is expanding day by day, and the customs clearance procedures are also increasing day by day, so sometimes there are inevitable delays in handling matters. If it were not for the housing difficulties in this city, he would try his best to transfer customs officers from the interior to Shanghai in batches to alleviate the immediate needs. (4) After the victory, customs offices in various places have been restored one after another, from Qinhuangdao in the north to Dihua in the west, and Haikou in the south. There are already 40 customs offices established across the country. Among them, the newly established ones include Tainan, Taipei, and Guangzhou Bay. There are several customs offices in the interior, such as Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Zhou, which have recently been considered for closure because the government has abolished the inland transit tax. Other places such as Yantai, Weihaiwei, Longkou in Shandong, and Harbin, Hunchun, Andong, Dalian, and Fanyang in the Northeast cannot restore customs offices due to the special circumstances in those places, but the customs has been fully prepared and is ready to station and rehabilitate them at any time when the situation permits. (5) At the end, Mr. Li spoke about the current imbalance of imports and exports in our country and hoped that it could be adjusted as soon as possible. Mr. Li said that the international market has a strong demand for our country's products, but the domestic labor and raw material costs are too high, and transportation is not smooth, resulting in expensive prices that cannot meet the foreign price levels. He hopes that the points of stagnation can be improved to the best of his ability.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Gold Prices Stable, U.S. Dollar Continues to Fall; Hong Kong Notes Rise Another Ten Yuan Compared to Previous Closing <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's ingot was stable and strong, opening with a good start in the morning. The U.S. dollar continued to weaken, and there was a flow of profit-taking at high prices, gradually declining. After ten o'clock, the central bank distributed 90 bars at a price of 1.95 million, with the lowest price falling to 1.945 million. After that, the demand for supply was slack, and it continued to struggle around 1.95 million yuan until noon. After that, it continued to be stable, rising to over 1.96 million, resulting in an increase of 12,000 compared to the previous day. Decorative gold rose, while standard silver and silver dollars were flat. The unofficial credit was still loose, and the interest rate was around 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were still suppressed by profit-taking, unable to rally. Initially, there were sellers at 2,580 yuan, gradually declining without any special changes. By noon, it had fallen below 2,540 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold market was slightly stronger, with a slight increase, resulting in a decrease of 15 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong notes rose to over 560 yuan before leveling off slightly, resulting in another increase of 10 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates were constrained by the immobile interbank rate, rising slightly to around 550 yuan. Indian exchange rates were 670 yuan, and British exchange rates were 9,000 yuan, both lacking buyers. U.S. exchange rates remained flat.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Scarce Public Debt Trading <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Public debt transactions have suddenly become sparse again, leading to a lack of support. The "Bing" series, since opening at 810 yuan, has consistently seen more supply than demand. Midday trading fell to 660 yuan before short covering provided support and the market rebounded somewhat. Ultimately, it closed 180 yuan lower than the previous close. Series "Jia" and "Yi" fell 50 yuan, "Ding" fell 130 yuan, and "Wu" fell 190 yuan. Price differences have thus converged.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Easy Monetary Conditions; Chinese Shares Rebound <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Chinese shares are rebounding due to easier monetary conditions, which are being used to boost large-cap stocks. Small-cap stocks are still struggling to recover. At the morning's lowest points, Wing On Spinning was at 475 yuan, Mei Ah at 2770 yuan, King Fook at 165 yuan, Sun Kwong at 183 yuan, and Chun Hing at 145 yuan. Prices rose near midday. Buying interest in less active small- and mid-cap stocks was strong, and the upward trend is just beginning, making supply difficult to obtain. Compared to the previous close, Wing On Spinning, Mei Ah, King Fook, and Sun Kwong all showed slight gains. Chun Hing remained flat. Among the less active small- and mid-cap stocks, only Sino-French Underwear rose by half a percentage point; the rest also saw slight increases. The veteran blue-chip stocks continued to make slight progress. The panic atmosphere in foreign stocks has not yet dissipated, with operators mostly on the sidelines. After a weak opening, the recovery of Chinese shares provided some stimulus. Ewo Silk was able to rebound from 7200 yuan to 7650 yuan. Ultimately, Ewo Silk, British &amp; Chinese Corporation, and Kwong Yick Hong saw slight declines, while Ewo Brewery, China Paper, and Jardine Matheson saw slight increases.</p>
<h3 id="e149">White Tung Oil, Hankow Telegram Falls <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>White tung oil prices had risen in the past two weeks due to domestic sales activity, but a lack of export demand limited the gains. The market has now stabilized after the slight rise. With another telegram from Hankow reporting a slight decline, the general market price is around 57,000 yuan per picul, causing a similar weakness in the local market. Relying solely on domestic sales is unlikely to be sustainable. Local traders are also loosening their selling prices slightly, generally around 76,000 yuan. However, Hongjiang tung oil is relatively stable due to peak summer sales, with West Deputy brand oils around 80,000 yuan, and local Hong oil at 70,000 to 67,000 or 68,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market was tight due to it being a Saturday and spot goods being scarce. The Association's quoted spot price for 20th grade central sand white sugar initially started at 95,000 yuan, then 4500 yuan and 4000 yuan. It then turned tight, rising to 67,000 yuan, up 3000 yuan from the previous day. Wenzhou central sand white sugar, due to being double-wrapped, was only 85,000 yuan, while warehouse receipts were 94,000 yuan, up 3000 to 4000 yuan. Semi-refined white sugar was 140,000 yuan. Chaozhou merchants were offering delivery certificates for 81,000 to 82,000 yuan for grade A, and 79,000 to 80,500 yuan for Huang Wanqing, also slightly tight. Xinghua merchants were offering ordinary red sugar at 95,000 to 97,000 yuan, and second-grade white sugar at 100,000 yuan. Jian merchants were offering grade A at 78,000 yuan. Total transactions amounted to approximately 300 lots.</p>

<p>Export tea is extremely dull. After repeated consultations by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., the Keemun aged black tea issue was finally resolved. However, market sentiment is very weak. As for domestic mixed teas, supply and demand are balanced. However, demand for new Shaoxing fried tea and Taiwan black tea from Suzhou merchants has suddenly strengthened, boosting morale and driving prices up. As a result, prices rose by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per picul compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Rediscount Measures; Executive Yuan Has Not Yet Approved <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>There is general expectation for the Central Bank to implement rediscounting. It has been learned that the Central Bank has drafted measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. Once approved, they will be implemented. According to Deputy Director Gao of the Military Finance Inspection Office, very few commercial banks are currently investing in factories, which often hinders industrial production. Rediscounting can alleviate the difficulties faced by factories. However, the resulting increase in market credit may stimulate inflation, which must be addressed in advance. This issue requires careful consideration and is related to the measures of both the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, the implementation measures must be submitted for approval.</p>

<p>Hemp was originally intended for export, but due to high prices after the war, export trade has not been very active. Although goods from various production areas arrived in Shanghai this spring, the market remained stagnant due to sluggish sales, hovering between 60,000 and 70,000 yuan for several months. Recently, due to the activation of domestic sales, mainly for weaving summer cloth, the market has suddenly soared. The current highest price for high-grade bundled hemp is around 100,000 yuan per picul, while Yuanjiang hemp is also at 90,000 yuan.</p>

<p>English and American Currencies Lowered by 14 Percent</p>
<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, 13th] The Swedish National Bank announced last night that it was reducing the statutory parities of the pound sterling and the US dollar against the Swedish krona. Effective from the 13th, one US dollar is worth SEK 3.60 (previously SEK 4.20), while one pound sterling is worth SEK 24.5 (previously SEK 16.92). The dollar and pound values are approximately 14 percent lower.</p>
<h3 id="e155">The National Bank's Business; Not Yet Fully Specialized; Remarks by Manager Li of the Bank of Communications <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Mr. Li Daonan, manager of the Bank of Communications, recently expressed his opinion on the specialization of national banks, saying that the specialization of banks is still in its early stages. Generally, all banks engage in common banking businesses, such as facilitating domestic and foreign trade finance, and ordinary deposits and loans. Each national bank focuses on different areas. The Bank of China focuses on handling foreign exchange. The Bank of Communications focuses on developing industries. The Farmers Bank of China focuses on agricultural loans. The Central Trust Bureau focuses on procuring materials for the state and operating warehousing businesses, as well as providing loans for cultural undertakings. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau focuses on lending for public utilities. The division of business boundaries can only be described as focusing on different areas, rather than pure specialization. For example, the Bank of Communications provides loans of 100 million yuan, with 50% specifically for industrial and commercial enterprises, and the rest allocated to commerce and other sectors, showing that the business has indeed focused on industrial development, while still taking into account sectors outside the industrial sphere that require loan assistance. The same is true for other banks. In the future, we should follow national policies and gradually move towards specialization based on social conditions and the needs of the economic environment.</p>

<p>Yesterday's yarn market was extremely ordinary. Sales of large-sized yarn were weak, with prices falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Medium-sized yarn lacked the strength to rise. Small-sized yarn was being purchased by customers from Nanjing, Wuhu, and other places, so prices remained stable. Other counts were also very ordinary. Overall trading volume was low, and morale was temporarily neutral, with the future seemingly entering a consolidation phase.</p>
<p>Yesterday's New York cotton futures telex showed gains of 23 to 29 points. Nearby was at US$34.03, distant at US$34.39, and the Middling spot price was US$34.85. Spot cotton trading in the local market was still good. Shen Hsin No. 1 Factory and Nantong Dasheng, Wuxi Zhenxin, and Dahua and other private cotton mills were all purchasing. Market prices continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, following US cotton.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 13th] Silk traders here are firmly of the view that raw silk prices should be reduced. They believe that the current level of $10 per pound should be lowered to $6 per pound by the end of 1946. Before the war, silk prices were $3 to $4 per pound. It is reported that traders have rejected recent sales of Italian raw silk below $10. The State Department has recently set a minimum selling price of $8.50 for 5,000 bales of Japanese raw silk that were recently sold, but manufacturers believe this price is too high. They believe that natural silk will compete with rayon in the future, so prices must be lowered.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 13th] Mr. D, President of the US Testing Company, the person in charge of inspecting imported silk, recently discussed the future of the Japanese silk industry in the Commercial News, saying: Japan's production in 1945 was 85% lower compared to 1940, while silk reeling capacity was 91% lower. However, Japan still has a stockpile of 50,000 bales reeled during 1940-1942 ready for export, plus 120,000 bales that can be reeled in 1946, bringing the total to 170,000 bales. 120,000 bales can be exported, 130,000 bales will be available for export in 1947, and 150,000 bales may be available in 1948. Currently, silkworm farming has become a major agricultural issue in Japan. Mulberry trees are being cultivated extensively in poor and remote areas unsuitable for other crops. The silkworm farming work is being done by the elderly, weak, women and children who are not suitable for heavy field work. The female workers employed in silk reeling factories are the daughters of rural families, and their parents sign work contracts with the factories. Furthermore, all factories are located far inland, isolated from major industrial cities. Therefore, in the future of the Japanese economy, no industry can replace the silk industry. Mr. D believes that Japan will use its talents to produce silk manufacturers to compete with rayon. However, during the reconstruction period, Japan will face competitive pressure and gradually reduce its production costs so that the final price of silk exported to the United States, except perhaps for a short period, will be at the lowest possible level. Italy and Chinese natural silk are also attempting to compete in the US market. The number of Italian silk arrivals is quite considerable, while Chinese silk initially appeared active but has recently shown signs of loosening.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Passenger and Cargo Transport to Shanghai Gradually Increasing; Rice Market Transactions Becoming Clearer; Rice Weevils Moving to Nanxiang <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The rice market trend has been gradually stabilizing in recent days. The source of passengers and cargo has increased sharply, and various grades are gradually softening. Due to profit opportunities, merchants are working diligently to transport rice, and the amount of rice transported to Shanghai has increased by about half compared to half a month ago. It is heard that a large amount of rice is being collected by merchants in the production area, preparing for shipment. Currently, all rice stores in the city have resumed selling rice, but the most common is second-grade indica rice, and high-quality japonica rice is in short supply. The Social Affairs Bureau is paying close attention to this point. Yesterday, the registration volume of passengers and cargo at the Nanshi market was 1,412 piculs, at the Beishi market it was 1,523 piculs and 4.5 dou. Rice stores were transporting and selling 820 piculs on their own. Flour remained flat. Bran softened. Wheat prices were high in the production areas, and sellers were firm, with prices rising by 300 to 400 yuan. Soybeans also increased by 500 to 600 yuan due to active cake making. Soybean cake continued to rise by 300 to 400 yuan. Raw peanuts were scarce, and prices rose again by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The oil market was stable.</p>
<p>Also, recently, some unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai, due to strict food control in Shanghai, have been moving their operations to Nanxiang, causing rice prices in Nanxiang to be higher than in Shanghai. There is a trend of rice being transported to Shanghai being redirected to Nanxiang. The municipal authorities are now paying close attention to this, and the mayor has appointed Section Chief Ji to personally inspect Nanxiang yesterday morning, to strictly crack down on this unhealthy trend.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 13th] A recent shipment of menthol arriving here from China, a total of 50 boxes, is of excellent quality and can be called the best. It is estimated that China currently has about 200,000 pounds of menthol.

It is reported that the price of the menthol has already increased.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 13th] Mr. Morse, Chairman and General Manager of HSBC Bank, in the first annual meeting after the war, mentioned the situation in China, praising President Chiang Kai-shek's leadership in resisting Japan and ultimately winning the final victory. Regarding the economy, Mr. Morse said that the famine and inflation in China are still very serious. The amount of paper money issued is unclear, and the government does not publish figures on the state of receipts and expenditures. The practice of tax evasion has not been eliminated, and prices continue to rise. Although the official exchange rate of legal tender to the US dollar is 2020 to 1, the Chinese government refuses to determine the exchange rate of the pound sterling based on the London and New York telex rates, so the black market is very inconsistent. He also mentioned China's foreign debt, stating that the total amount of sterling foreign debt is no more than £60,000,000, while the foreign debt in other currencies may reach £75,000,000. Therefore, sterling bondholders naturally hope that the government can resume repayment, because the smaller amount of foreign debt is guaranteed by the Chinese government.</p>

<p>— Zhu Minwei</p>
<p>As a reporter, while on the 30-mile road in Tokyo, Japan, I not only admired the Japanese Kamikaze Air Force, but also saw the array of American military trucks, jeeps, and tanks parked on the vacant field by the roadside near Yokohama (these things, like garbage, have been parked in the open space 20 feet from the road since the US military landed in Tokyo Bay last year. These things have now become completely worthless, but they symbolize the reason why the owner was able to subdue Japan. These numerous things, forming an almost military ocean, are worth watching with wide eyes in the eyes of someone from an empty country. But here, they are just a pile of junk. The Americans use them as a symbol of their rule without moving them. Just like the four million citizens of Shanghai saw the array of tanks of the Japanese military headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road in those years. Because they knew that flesh and blood could not stop the crushing of iron tracks.</p>
<p>After we entered the Yokohama urban area, the scene of the destruction of the Japanese mainland and the structure of Japanese capitalism appeared simultaneously. Although Yokohama and Tokyo are two cities, they are actually like Shanghai and the Jiangwan New City district that is about to be built. They have merged into one. Yokohama, with its harbor, dockyards, piers, warehouses, and cranes, serves as Tokyo's port of entry and exit, while Tokyo serves as Yokohama's inner chamber, restaurant, and bath, relying on each other. The roads we drove on were wide, flat, and clean. The density of streetcar tracks on the road and the overhead tram cables is the crystallization of 40 years of Japanese material progress. The great bombings destroyed six-tenths of the houses in Yokohama and Tokyo, but did not destroy the transportation systems and road administration of these two cities. On this point alone, Tokyo and Yokohama are better than Shanghai. And besides, there are many cities like Tokyo and Yokohama in Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e165">MacArthur is a Savior, Healing the Japanese <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The reason why MacArthur distributed so few occupation troops militarily is that MacArthur has achieved great success politically and does not need to use a large number of troops. By granting Japan some superficial sovereignty, for example: the Emperor is still the highest political power in Japan. The House of Representatives of the Japanese government is composed of parties with democratic tendencies, but the cabinet is usually led by leaders of moderate parties, implementing the decisions of MacArthur's headquarters. The regulatory effect that MacArthur urgently wants to achieve at present is not to promote the prestige of the occupying country or to satisfy the occupying country's needs, but to seek stability for the 70 million people on this land based on the minimum living requirements of the Japanese people. Therefore, a Japanese publication drew MacArthur bandaging the wounds of the injured Japanese. MacArthur's true intention is also to hope that the Japanese can be reassigned to labor tasks after their wounds heal.</p>
<p>Based on this, we can understand why MacArthur allows Japanese fishing boats to go to the surrounding oceans to fish. The 40 ships going to the China Sea are only a small number of the thousands of fishing boats that Japan is allowed to send to the outer oceans. We can also understand why MacArthur wants the countries of the occupying army to transport grain by ship to supply the occupying army stationed in Japan, instead of purchasing it locally in famine-stricken Japan. We can understand why American newspapers and Japanese newspapers in Tokyo specifically highlighted the news that the headquarters had transported flour from the United States to Japan in large characters.</p>
<p>Although MacArthur has given Japan various supplies in terms of economy, the Japanese food problem this year and in the future is still a major issue. 70 million Japanese live on these four islands. Due to the narrow land and too little arable land, it is impossible to meet their food needs. Therefore, in the past few decades, Japan has always exchanged industrial products for rice from Malaysia, Vietnam, and Siam. The rice production of Korea and Taiwan was unconditionally supplied to the Japanese mainland. Now, Japanese prisoners and Japanese nationals are being repatriated to the mainland from all over the world, the source of food has disappeared, and there are many people who need food. The Japanese food problem is ultimately the most serious problem for Japan in the future.</p>
<p>MacArthur's second method is to maintain Japanese light industry so that it can exchange surplus products for food. The 2,570,000 spindles, 100,000 looms, and 130,000 rayon spindles that have started production are all working hard to exchange for foreign food for Japan. Those who are clear about the situation in South America and Southeast Asia should know that these two regions can export food. MacArthur's use of Japan's existing three million tons of ships is enough to maintain Japan's needs for exporting yarn and silk and importing food.</p>
<p>The Japanese now know that they cannot be autonomous, because in this war, they caused too much trouble. After surrendering, they only seek to survive. All early propositions and arguments have been abandoned. MacArthur's rule of Japan seems to be aimed only at obtaining an obedient follower of the United States, so he focuses on economic supplies to heal Japan's post-war wounds, politically makes any Japanese cabinet implement headquarters decisions, and militarily uses symbolic methods to make Japan understand that resistance and sabotage are useless, and bow to accept the implementation of all terms. The end is to psychologically make Japan gradually awaken from the contempt for the United States and the exaggerated Japanese strength to friendliness and admiration for the United States. Therefore, after MacArthur occupied Japan, except for arresting Japanese war criminals to complete the psychological warfare purpose, the US military did not arrest or mistakenly arrest a single Japanese person. The impression that the US military gave the Japanese was that they were innocent, lively, cheerful, handsome, and polite, and did not infringe on the civilians at all. The good reactions of the Japanese to the US military that I saw in any place can prove that this impression is not wrong.</p>
<p>This psychological effect of doing many righteous things is actually the application of the principle that we Chinese have had many examples of since the Warring States period. But it seems that because our own affairs are messy, we have no time to care about the outside world. The United States, with a year of youthful national vitality, can use the ancient magic of inviting good people.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of doing many righteous things? Today, when we look at the uncoordinated arrangement of the world, we can always know that, therefore, the cunning Japanese are secretly happy in their hearts. When they can still exert their strength in their lives, another era of Japanese turnaround will always come. Therefore, the lower-level Japanese are sincerely obedient, the upper-level Japanese have been imprisoned or died, and a small part of the middle-level Japanese are waiting for a great era to turn around. Their dream, in my opinion, will not succeed, because the American governing experts have a deep memory of the Pearl Harbor lessons and the three years of disastrous defeat in the Pacific. The 25-year plan to control Japan is the best way to erase the resurgence of a strong group on the earth by "a long period of years." After 25 years, the Japanese middle-level figures who are secretly happy today will all be old or materialized. Japanese children in their teens have been educated and influenced by pro-American education. After 25 years, they will be in power. No one can imagine that the dissatisfied 100 million Japanese on those four islands at that time will have the power to be autonomous and resist the United States, which has a population of nearly 200 million (the population of the United States after 25 years). Besides, the United States not only seeks friendship in Japan, but also universally seeks good people in any land on the earth.</p>

<h3 id="e166">The Far East International Tribunal: A Stage for Psychological Warfare <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Far East International Tribunal, with American Judge Webb as its chief, is truly a well-directed play by the American Psychological Warfare Department. The court convenes almost daily at the former Japanese Army Ministry Military Tribunal. On June 21st, Mr. Ruan Weixin, the director of the Chinese delegation, said he would accompany us to observe the trial of the 28 war criminals, including Tojo. Early in the morning of the 24th, Adjutant Qian Mingnian drove us to the hearing. I sat in the stuffy air upstairs for an hour and felt like I couldn't breathe. Exiting and watching at the gate, American military police were playfully slapping each other on the silent guard post, chatting with a British driver.</p>
<p>The eleven judges are truly representatives of eleven countries that were wronged and harmed by Japanese aggression since the "September 18th Incident" (China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, Australia, Canada, India, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and New Zealand). However, because the grand production of the future world's human history must have substance, they are too embarrassed to simply shout "Give me back my head!" and chop off the heads of the Japanese war criminals. Therefore, judges and prosecutors were selected to form the Far East Tribunal, and Tojo and the other 28 Japanese people who should be held responsible for returning their heads were subjected to exhausting interrogations time and time again (already more than fifty times). Especially in this hot weather, the judges and war criminals in the Far East Tribunal are all wearing thick clothes during each trial, and the room is crowded and stuffy. Only the American military police with white helmets have cold light radiating from their green eyes. The eleven judges seem to be enjoying it tirelessly, and every member of the occupying forces who comes to Japan seems to consider seeing Tojo's true face as a major accomplishment. After receiving visitor passes, they squeeze into the ordinary seats upstairs or the VIP seats downstairs to sweat and listen. I really think this is just a piece of psychological warfare drama.</p>
<p>On the evening of June 20th, I entered the Tokyo district, and on the morning of June 25th, I left Tokyo for Atsugi Airport. I only stayed in Tokyo for a little over four days, one of which was spent touring the scenic area of Atami, a hundred miles away. I was actually in Tokyo for three days, and my experiences were limited. I plan to record them in several sections. First, I must talk about the part of the American rule in Japan.</p>
<p>The MacArthur Headquarters in Tokyo, facing the Japanese Imperial Palace from afar, appears on the surface to be a purely military headquarters, and its representative, General MacArthur, seems to be a pure military man. However, in reality, it is a group of various American experts. These experts are not famous, but in fact, every order and decision of MacArthur is the result of the research of these experts on specialized issues or their responsible departments. These experts do not allow their "specialized" or "biased" views to hinder the overall American policy towards Japan. On the contrary, the common and comprehensive opinions of these experts constitute the content of the American policy towards Japan.</p>
<p>The United States' offer of surrender to Japan, although intended to reduce casualties on its own side and to reduce casualties on the Japanese side, was mainly motivated by the desire to bring the people, land, and resources of Japan into the sphere of obedience to the will of the United Nations. If Japan had been invaded, the postwar occupation of Japan would have inevitably led to dock destruction, port destruction, transportation system destruction, and hatred and hostile actions of the Japanese people towards the Allied occupation. That situation would have been even worse than the reaction Japan received from invading and occupying China. Therefore, when Japan decided to surrender, seeking only to preserve the Emperor system, the United States quickly accepted this condition and took on the task of accepting Japan's surrender.</p>
<p>The initial occupying forces in Japan consisted of only 200,000 American soldiers. Except for the Kuril Islands north of Hokkaido, which were first occupied by Soviet forces, all four major islands of Japan were occupied by American forces. Until this year, British, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Dutch, and Philippine forces appeared in Japan in small numbers. MacArthur Headquarters stipulates that the total number of Allied forces should not exceed 0.4% of the Japanese population, that is, one Allied occupying soldier for every 250 Japanese people. In reality, there are only 170,000 Allied soldiers stationed on the Japanese mainland, and the ratio of Allied soldiers to the Japanese population is 1 to 411, which is still within the prescribed "point" and does not constitute a "line," let alone a "surface" occupation.</p>
<p>As we passed a steel bridge, a white-painted sign with red characters faced us, which read: "Now you have arrived in Tokyo!" This is a sentence with profound meaning. This sentence includes many tragic and joyful stories. Under this sentence, Americans died the most, and Chinese died even more than Americans. I thought of the scene of the United Nations forces entering Tokyo from this bridgehead last September, and the meaning of this sentence became even more profound!</p>
<p>Looking at the broken walls and rubble in the Tokyo city area, we realized that the bombing of Chongqing, Sichuan, was insignificant. Our car stopped at the Imperial Bank Yurakukan in Ginza Yurakucho. Although the night in Tokyo was mysteriously attractive, we hid on the fourth floor and silently pondered the events of the day.</p>
<p>I thought that most plane crashes are caused by clouds blocking the ground, and encountering hills higher than the ground and obscured by clouds during landing. Although Shanghai has no mountainous terrain, the cloud height during takeoff is less than 300 feet, which is very dangerous if landing. Fortunately, the plane was in good condition, and the weather in Tokyo was clear when my plane arrived, so the plane took off according to the scheduled time without hesitation.</p>
<p>We lay in the rooms of the American lieutenant's guest house, listening to the low-pitched conversations of the American officers, and fell asleep without realizing it.</p>

<p>On June 23rd, Captain Luo Linbao and Lieutenant Yan Zhiliang, Chinese officers stationed in Japan, accompanied me and Huang Eryi, Chen Gongmao, and others on an excursion to Atami Onsen. After a two-and-a-half-hour train ride, I felt that the Japanese transportation system was undamaged and deeply rooted. There were more than twenty mountain tunnels along the way, one of which was about five minutes long, more than twice as long as the Zhenjiang tunnel on the Beijing-Shanghai Line.</p>
<p>Atami is located on the shore of Sagami Bay, about 100 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, at the foot of Mount Hakone, a branch of Mount Fuji. The hot springs gushing out, the small town city, leaning against the mountains and facing the sea, the scenery is excellent, making it a popular suburban resort for Tokyo residents for summer sea bathing and winter hot spring bathing. This small town city has not been disturbed by the war at all. The storefronts in the streets are more beautiful than those in Tokyo, but the prices of the items sold are also very expensive. There is nothing else besides food, toys, and daily necessities. Two black American soldiers bought a painting called "Floating Boat" for their Japanese female companions in a bead shop.</p>
<p>Touring the seaside bathing beach, watching the green boats floating on the sea, Japanese men, women, adults and children swimming in the water, the scene is really moving. I didn't bring swimming clothes, so I just acted as an observer. I feel that the Japanese live on an island, and the sunlight, seawater, and the beautiful scenery of the island can cultivate this nation. Every citizen becomes a healthy member. If they don't dream of dominating the world and other races, other countries are willing to cooperate with them and supply them with the food they lack. This island nation specializing in technological development could easily become the modern-day shadow of the ancient Greek nation in the East.</p>
<p>We had a meal at the Heian Chinese Restaurant, climbed to the fourth floor to see the panoramic view of Atami Bay, and listened to the sound of the tide lapping against the shore in the twilight. I thought that if this wonderful travel opportunity had not been approved by General Zhou Zhirou, I would not have had it. Although the travel of a few days was in a hurry, the scenery and objects of Japan were always presented before my eyes like a mirage. If I have the opportunity in the future, I would like to live in this country often.</p>
<p>At 9 pm, I and Brother Chen Gongmao and others took the last train back to Tokyo. We were not sitting in the velvet Allied special car but in the tail-end military car full of goods, among which there were dozens of chicks chirping and singing, which aroused an old American soldier's idea. He said:</p>
<p>"I really want to raise such a group of chicks in my home, but I still have five months before I can go back. This regulation really makes me depressed."</p>
<p>We told him that we also wanted to return to our hometown to raise chickens, and did not want to be a foreign soldier outside, but we kept secret about the fact that we were about to return home, fearing that he would take out the wine bottle in his bag and pour it down again because of this.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Weekday Forum: On the So-Called "Financial Turmoil" <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Kangsha</p>
<p>For the past two weeks, the Shanghai market first saw a sharp drop in public bonds, several speculative firms went bankrupt, and some speculative friends fled, involving employees of several banks. This was followed by the liquidation of Daya Bank, coinciding with the "end of June" settlement and the transfer of large amounts of cigarette tax revenue to the national treasury, tying up a portion of funds and leading to a tightening of credit. After the opening of the customs earlier this month, the situation remained the same. A few banks and firms were unable to make up for the exchange differences as early as possible, which caused a delay in smoothing things out, thus causing many rumors. Newspapers reported this and exaggerated the situation, publishing news that certain banks and firms had suspended business, causing widespread panic. In fact, daily exchange of notes among banks and firms, whether the difference is large or small, is common. In today's absence of a joint reserve institution, those who are temporarily short of funds must seek funds from all sides, especially when everyone is tightening lending. There is nothing surprising about this. To conclude that the entire financial industry is experiencing "turmoil" is an exaggeration. This situation is just like when a four-foot-long green snake appeared on Guangxi Road some time ago, and the newspapers deliberately exaggerated it as "a giant python has appeared," which is as ridiculous!</p>
<p>Of course, the blow suffered by some speculators in the past two weeks cannot be said to be insignificant. But this is unrelated to the entire financial industry. Because everyone has long known that the public bond trading on the black market is out of the ordinary, and the general financial industry and prudent speculators have regarded it as a snake, not paying attention to it. This is in contrast to the days of the pre-war Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, where a few consecutive drops in public bonds would shake the entire market. Currently, it can be said that public bonds have almost no impact on the financial industry. The manipulators first fabricated the false news that customs gold would be returned, raising the price of a hundred-yuan ticket to over two thousand yuan. The government already had rumors at the time, but they still went further, falsely claiming that "Sun banknotes" would be returned, even saying that a ten-thousand-yuan ticket could be exchanged for ten taels of gold, and forcibly raised the market price to over eight thousand yuan. Originally, who would be fooled by such absurd rumors, except for foolish friends who were blinded by profit and lambs waiting to be slaughtered? Therefore, this time the market price has fallen sharply. Although the amount of losses suffered by speculators is quite alarming, the scope of the impact is not widespread. However, they are accustomed to using fraudulent methods to defraud stocks and cash from various sources to make up for their discounts, causing many people to be implicated. Because of the fall in public bonds, they then cut stocks to make contributions, so the stock market price also fell sharply. At this time, the secured creditors rushed to redeem and shrink their loans, so the stock market became smaller and smaller, and the credit in the speculative market became tighter and tighter. A series of embezzlement cases by employees of firms and banks were exposed. As a result, Daya Bank was forced to close, and the news spread, so the market could not avoid turbulence.</p>
<p>Facts tell us that the funds used by Shanghai speculators in the past six months have come entirely from the speculative market. Because the interest rate for savings in the banking industry is low, and the hidden interest rate outside is high, many wealthy friends have directly or indirectly lent funds in the market to earn interest. Therefore, the fluctuations in the speculative market have no connection with the financial industry. But in the end, it will inevitably be implicated. The reason is very simple. Originally, the market is a whole and cannot be separated. "Pull one hair and move the whole body" is a fitting description of this situation. However, as far as the entire financial industry in Shanghai is concerned, they have experienced many hardships and seen many changes. With their long history and experience, they don't regard these small waves as anything at all. Although some newspapers are exaggerating the financial tension, the staff in the banking and money industries associations are always quiet and leisurely, which shows the truth about the so-called "turmoil."</p>
<p>The Chinese secret to success is "Everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, and doesn't care about the frost on other people's tiles." In the past, when the economic organization was simple, one could take care of oneself. But in today's complex economic organization, if the financial industry continues to adhere to the old rules and watch the fire from across the river, it may eventually spread to itself. Recently, everyone in the industry has tightened credit and stopped lending, and checks are not allowed to be used on the same day. This is commendable in terms of business policy. But if Company A does this, Company B will follow suit, and Company C and D will follow suit. As a result, the clearing house will return bills worth one or two hundred billion, which will cause many unnecessary rumors. This measure seems to be worth studying.</p>
<p>In times of financial turmoil, the most important thing is to stabilize people's minds and eliminate rumors. Otherwise, unfounded rumors will spread more and more widely, and depositors' psychology will panic, causing them to rush to withdraw their deposits. At this time, if the response is not handled properly, it will really cause a disaster. The financial industry's main business is to provide and receive credit. However, any loans issued by banks and firms cannot be recovered in a short period of time, and currently 95% of deposits are floating in nature, which can easily be withdrawn in full within half a day. Even banks and firms with good credit and sufficient reserves will be helpless in this situation. During the American financial panic in the past, a well-known bank stood firm. However, one day, because the clock in the bank was inaccurate, the opening of the gate in the morning was delayed by a few minutes, which immediately triggered rumors that the bank was closed. One spread to ten, and ten spread to a hundred. When the gate opened, countless depositors poured in, and the cash was withdrawn in an instant, making it impossible to turn around, and the bank was forced to close. This was truly an unwarranted disaster, but it also shows the significant impact of rumors on public psychology in times of market turmoil. Therefore, it is not the best way for each bank and firm to hold its ground.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the economic illness of Shanghai is getting more and more serious every day. Factories are breathing their last breath because of high costs and the inability to compete with foreign goods. Shops are eating their way to ruin due to high expenses and sluggish business. The heavy burden of interest is the fatal wound of all industries. If industry and commerce do not hurry to open up a new path, the future will be in danger. The situation of the financial industry may be a hundred times more serious than the consequences of the recent collapse of the bond market. "Treading on thin ice leads to danger," and I deeply hope that the entire financial industry in the city will prepare as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It has been almost a year since the victory, and Shanghai's financial industry still lacks an institution to maintain collective security, which is a great regret. Stabilizing the market is not only the obligation of the financial industry, but also the responsibility of the financial authorities and national banks. If they only know to tighten up indiscriminately, regardless of the severity or urgency, and the regulations on deposit reserve are too rigid, forming a freeze, and the central bank is unable to do its best to support the industry when necessary, it is inevitable that people will have something to say. We sincerely hope that with the full support of the financial authorities and the central bank, a joint reserve association for the banking and money industries will be established as soon as possible, so that the financial industry can concentrate its strength and funds, shoulder the burden of helping each other through thick and thin, maintain collective security, and cope with possible future difficulties.</p>

<p>Nutritional Value of Skim Milk Powder Unchanged</p>
<p>I have received your letter of the 5th of this month, and the four letters from readers attached to it, and I will reply to you as follows: (1) For questions asked by Mr. Zhang Yingzhi and Mr. Zhu Yunsheng, please refer to the Interim Measures for Applying for Milk Powder. Five copies of the measures are attached. (2) Regarding the points asked by Mr. Wang Sheng and Mr. Wang Gengcai about the milk powder distributed to students, the milk powder issued by this bureau is "skim milk powder" rather than "whole milk powder" containing butter. Therefore, this type of milk powder, in addition to milk fat, retains all the various nutrients that should be in milk and has not lost them. However, the powder is coarser, has no butter aroma, and has no turbidity. This milk powder is not suitable for direct drinking and must be prepared. For the method, please refer to the "Instructions for Skim Milk Powder" issued by this bureau. Five copies of the instructions are attached. Corresponding to the above two points, the original four letters are returned with the letter. I hope you will check and reply separately. It would be greatly appreciated if it could be published. Sincerely, the Social Service Section of the Shen Bao Editorial Department. Five copies of the attached form, Instructions, and four copies of the original letter.

<p>Editor: Today, after victory, terrible facts have been brought to our classmates. Students have no books to read, the cost of living is rising, parents have no ability to bear it, and teachers cannot receive their salaries. Such facts have to fall into stagnation. Victory has brought some hunger and bandits to the people. Peiping is a city of culture, and the number of bandits is due to the pressure of life. The prices after victory are indeed astonishing. The heavy burden of life is really too much for the people to bear. Many people die on the line of life! (Zhang Hongwen, sent from Beiping)</p>
<h3 id="e173">How Heavy are the Excessive Taxes? <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>After the July 7th Incident and the outbreak of war, I took my wife and children to the rear, enduring all kinds of hardships along the way. With victory, I returned to my hometown. The house was burned, the fields were barren, everything was gone. With great difficulty, I borrowed tens of thousands of dollars from various sources and started a small business in the township. The income wasn't much, but it was enough to barely maintain our current life, and I was satisfied. But before long, a gentleman with a Mauser pistol came, saying he was investigating the population, asking questions endlessly. In the end, he left with a smile. Then a certain committee member came, investigating the population, organizing Baojia (local security units), and left with investigation fees, handling fees, and registration fees. The police station wanted compilation fees for compiling house numbers. The township security team wanted funding (the people in the occupied areas even had to pay opening fees and regular annual fees, which is truly outrageous). The tax bureau officials wanted to levy business tax, commodity tax, stamp tax, house and shop donation, and land donation (merchants in the occupied areas had to pay back taxes from before the victory. The director of the tax bureau was from another province and was followed by many armed men, a truly imposing sight). After the president of the Chamber of Commerce negotiated (it is said that there is something shady here), the Chamber of Commerce took over and offered a huge "Feng" character as a complete offering. The government, to protect the safety of the people and strengthen self-defense forces, apportioned gun fees, and urged collection day and night with the utmost urgency. However, until now, a certain Baozhang (local security head) still privately owes tens of thousands of dollars in gun fees at the time of handover, and it remains unresolved. This is probably because he worked hard as Baozhang for several months, and made some minor contributions, right? A certain section chief and a certain director apportioned cigarettes sold by the Chamber of Commerce at "honest prices for all ages". There were also numerous other items such as welcome fees, comfort fees... too many to list. Under all this exploitation, I left my hometown again and resumed a life of wandering. What should I do?</p>
<p>Sincerely, (Huang Fu)</p>
<h3 id="e174">Statement from the Coffin Repository Regarding No Price Increase <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: I recently read Mr. Huang Chunfu's article "The Coffin Repository Raises Prices Again and Again" in the Reader's Opinion column of your newspaper on June 28th, which is inconsistent with the facts. Our repository's regular coffin storage fee is 26,000 yuan per year, and there has been no increase to more than 38,000 yuan. The funeral procession fee of 10,000 yuan also does not include items such as sanitation donations or handling fees, and to say that we demand more than 100,000 yuan under various pretexts is truly surprising. Furthermore, coffin storage, funeral procession and other fees are fixed, how can we collect them indiscriminately? Mr. Huang Chunfu can come to our office to discuss this matter immediately in order to clarify the situation. (Respectfully, Pu'an Coffin Repository).</p>
<h3 id="e175">Milk Powder Distribution Was Not Embezzled <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: We recently read a letter in the Reader's Column of your newspaper on July 4th entitled "Students Cannot Receive Milk Powder", which is inconsistent with the facts. This school, when applying for Relief Administration milk powder on behalf of students this time, consulted the Education Bureau regarding the National Compulsory Education Classes attached to our school. According to the Education Bureau, "the National Compulsory Education Classes can also apply", so the 104 students in the National Compulsory Education Classes of our school were included in the application form. After receiving the milk powder, it was distributed in full. As for the Public Education Classes, this school did not apply because it did not receive a clear affirmative response, so there was no way to distribute it. The statement in the letter that "the milk powder was received in the name of students and taken away completely by the school" is absolutely false. The Relief Administration and the Education Bureau can investigate this matter. If it is true, our school is willing to accept the most severe punishment. Xu Chenfei, a student at our kindergarten, and Xu Jingfen, a student in the second grade, had a dispute with our school regarding the distribution of milk powder. Later, a newspaper published a false letter under a pseudonym accusing our school of profiting from the milk powder. Our school sent a letter correcting the facts. Now your newspaper has received a similar false letter. It is likely from the same source. Please publish this letter to correct public opinion. Private Jingrui Elementary School.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Random Thoughts on Reading <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>A young man with slender eyes and delicate eyebrows read a moving novel and told people with a smile: "Ah! I drank a glass of fine wine!" He read a light and淡雅 essay and told people with a smile: "Ah! I drank a bowl of clear tea!" He read a serious论文 and told people with a smile: "Ah! I ate a dose of good medicine!"</p>
<p>This young man can truly be said to be outstanding, because the general phenomenon is always like this: Confucian scholars look down on novels, scolding them for encouraging theft and lasciviousness, and damaging morality. Young people hate boring论文, saying they are like催眠符 and灵灵灵。People who love plain and profound文章 also嫌浪浪,一律一律。</p>
<p>In fact, nothing in the world can be generalized. There are indeed many novels that encourage theft and lasciviousness, but the power of valuable novels to teach and move people is more than ten thousand times greater than the great theories of Confucian scholars. Many浓浓文字 are indeed a waste, but we cannot deny the loveliness and greatness of a beautiful poem. As for serious说教, it does indeed give people a headache, but as the saying goes, "good medicine tastes bitter"; moreover, modern "good medicine" has been gradually improved, some are coated with sugar, and some are mixed with sweet juice, so they are not necessarily "bitter"!</p>
<p>People often call books the "food" of the spirit, and I think this is very appropriate. It is indeed beneficial for a person to "love all kinds of fish, meat, vegetables".</p>
<h3 id="e177">Little Qing (Fiction) <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>For years I have wandered, time passing in loneliness. Though I am not yet white-haired and wrinkled, after being weathered by the elements and dust, the luster of my radiant youth has faded a little. In order to isolate myself from the muddy and superficial world, I often use the pure innocence of childhood and the willfulness and frankness of youth as the courage to live on.</p>
<p>Whenever I am close to children, their words, laughter, and jumps seem like all the emotions accumulated in my heart are poured out, creating a lively and active model. This is why I love them and easily become their little companion.</p>
<p>Little Qing is my friend's niece. Her hair is deep, dark, and dense. Her eyes are bright and sparkling, moving very cleverly and intelligently. At first glance, she seems like a six- or seven-year-old girl, but she is only four years old this year. Because she doesn't live with us, she often comes to play with her grandmother.</p>
<p>When I first met her, she looked at me strangely. Because I had just come from the south not long ago, and was staying at my friend's house, she knew that she had never seen someone like me in this house. She was a little suspicious and timid. My friend said to her, "Little Qing, this is also an uncle, you should call him uncle."</p>
<p>She didn't call me, just stood there, but the suspicion had lessened. I greeted her in Southern Mandarin, but she didn't understand, just "uh, uh,"ed. She saw her uncle laughing beside her, and she laughed too. I then learned to say in awkward Shanghai dialect, "You don't understand what I just said, do you?"</p>
<p>"Don't understand! Don't understand!"</p>
<p>"I just came back from America, I'm speaking American, no wonder you don't understand," I deliberately teased her.</p>
<p>"You're really lying, what American is that? Halloo, yes, Halloo, yes, you don't even know how to say that!" she retorted. In a moment, she seriously repeated Halloo, yes... shaking her head and approaching me.</p>
<p>"Little Qing, really, he doesn't understand American. What he just said was actually Indian. Look at his dark face, he's Indian, just came from India, you should call him Uncle Asan," my friend joked.</p>
<p>"Ah! Uncle Asan!" she repeated with great interest, a lot of fresh pleasure flowing from her lips. From then on, Little Qing called me Uncle Asan. This is how I met Little Qing, and we quickly became familiar with each other.</p>
<p>"Little Qing, have you studied yet?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"I have, I study with little girls, we all read books at night."</p>
<p>She ran to the bookcase, took out a few children's magazines from the box, held them in her hands, opened one, sat on the low stool beside me, and began to read in a flurry. In fact, she didn't understand, she was just mimicking the way of reading, chanting and humming in a muddled way! Seeing her shaking her head and swaying her body, I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"Little Qing, you read really fast, I can't really hear what you're reading," I asked her seriously.</p>
<p>"Hush! What do you know," she said, then quickly went to get an English book, opened it on her lap, and heavily and laboriously read, "A, H, B; A, H, B," read a section and looked at me.</p>
<p>"Who taught you to read these?"</p>
<p>"My second uncle and third uncle both taught me," she said happily.</p>
<p>"You don't understand, you don't understand, the teacher will hit you!" she suddenly stood up, her two small arms wrapped tightly around my head, her mouth close to my ear, chattering; her feet stepped on the chair, and she climbed onto my shoulders. I don't know why, but I started yelling like she did just now "A, H, B, A, H, B;" I was thrown into a dreamlike and primal naivete.</p>
<p>"Why don't you ask little aunt to play?" I asked her one day.</p>
<p>"She's shy, I asked her, she won't come." She thought for a moment, then puckered her lips and said,</p>
<p>"What's there to be shy about, she's older than me, she's afraid to speak to people; adults are all like that, I really hate them!"</p>
<p>Because I had to write a letter, I didn't talk to her, and didn't pay attention to her. When I finished writing the letter, I looked back and saw Little Qing standing on a small stool, leaning against the dressing table, spreading hair oil with a comb, and combing her hair while looking in the mirror, with a few uneven piles of snow flower cream smeared on her cheeks. I couldn't help but laugh and ask her:</p>
<p>"Little Qing, what are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Combing my hair." At this time, she seemed a little shy, and said softly.</p>
<p>I fixed it for her, and she looked at her image in the mirror in contentment, a knowing smile on her face. Like a little angel, she was much more beautiful and delicate. This little soul already understands how to dress up and understands the pleasure produced by beauty. I thought to myself, isn't this the innate goodness of man?</p>
<p>Sometimes, when she saw me spacing out, she would scold me like she was lecturing me:</p>
<p>"You're really a dork!" Then she would tell me how to play and sing for a long time without stopping...</p>
<p>Once, she found a few envelopes on my desk, and asked me to give her a piece of stationery, saying she wanted to write a letter to her little aunt. After I gave her a piece of paper, she picked up the ink brush and drew many crooked lines, covering the whole paper without writing a single word.</p>
<p>"Have you finished writing? What did you write? Read it to me." I looked intently at her lovely appearance.</p>
<p>"I wrote this: Little Aunt, Uncle is in Shanghai, tell him to buy me some books." She clicked her head and read these two sentences, then reminded me, saying:</p>
<p>"Oh, and I also wrote to buy a doll." She pointed to the last line of lines, folded it up, and put it in the envelope.</p>
<p>Although I saw that what she wrote was not words, I didn't laugh at her; I thought that when her虚托文字 were read repeatedly, there would be errors that did not correspond to each other, so I asked her to take out the letter again and read it again, but she could still read the words she had just said, without any errors.</p>
<p>These are magical lines, woven into pure and innocent images! I was deeply moved, and when I looked at the full of nothing things I had written, I felt the shame and sadness of being fooled by age and worldliness!</p>
<p>It's been more than a week. Little Qing hasn't come to play with us. The letter she wrote last time was not taken away, I unfolded it again to see it; I hope to use this pure and innocent line to weave a human heart that is always brilliant and pure.</p>

<p>Brigade Commander "Dry Father" ran over and grabbed Lihua's hand, muttering again:</p>
<p>"Silly child, Dry Father will naturally let your mother come together! Dry Father will buy a house for you two; send orderlies to serve you, no matter what you eat or wear; Dry Father will take care of it."</p>
<p>Lihua knew things were not going well, and quickly stood up and said:</p>
<p>"I should go to the garden now. Dry Father!"</p>
<p>However, Brigade Commander "Dry Father" hugged her like an old eagle grabbing a chick, chuckled and said:</p>
<p>"It's early, my dear! Don't sing opera anymore, see how hard singing opera is! Dry Father has a lot of money, Dry Father will let you enjoy yourself, and raise you to be as fat as Dry Father! "Saying that, he touched Lihua's spine. "Oh! Your body is as thin as a bag of bones, my treasure! Don't do this anymore, tell your mother tomorrow, your mother will definitely be happy too." Brigade Commander "Dry Father" said, then drank a full glass of wine, and picked up a chopstick of vegetables and fed it directly to Lihua's mouth. "Eat! My sweetheart!"</p>
<p>"Dry Father, put me down, Dry Father, put me down!" Lihua turned her head away, struggling to break free from Brigade Commander "Dry Father's" embrace.</p>
<p>"Don't make trouble, sit obediently on Dry Father's body! Dry Father loves you!" Gentleman "Dry Father" said softly. He held Lihua tightly, and brought his mustache-covered lips over to kiss Lihua.</p>
<p>A scene from five years ago flashed in Lihua's mind again, and she resisted Brigade Commander "Dry Father" as she had resisted Zhang Xian back then. She felt even more serious terror! She dodged and shouted:</p>
<p>"Let me go! Dry Father! Let me go!"</p>
<p>Brigade Commander "Dry Father" didn't seem to hear, and gently turned Lihua's face, using his wine-scented mouth to kiss Lihua's mouth. This made Lihua unable to shout anymore, made Lihua fall into suffocation; made Lihua almost faint!</p>
<p>Just at this moment of extreme danger, a clap of thunder shocked Brigade Commander "Dry Father"—the door suddenly opened, and a woman with the majesty of a lion walked in, Brigade Commander "Dry Father" raised his head, "slap slap slap", met with a few slaps, he fled in a mess.</p>
<p>At this time, Lihua had not yet recovered her senses, and "slap slap" sounds flew to her cheeks!</p>

<p>— Xie Zi</p>
<p>Today because I didn't take a nap, my mother asked me to come to the room to rest for a while, but I really didn't want to sleep. I felt that it was too wasteful to spend this quiet and happy day in my sleep. This kind of happy day will turn into a relic in the blink of an eye, and my childhood has indeed turned into a relic. Where should I look for it?</p>
<p>I gently closed the door and walked along the green fence. It was really windy today, and the courtyard was full of fallen leaves dancing in the autumn wind. I closed my eyes and walked forward against the wind on the old path that I used to run on. I felt like I had returned to my old life, everything here was so familiar: the creaking sound of the small wooden door turning; the sound of leaves blowing from the branches and rubbing against the fence; and the sound of groups of birds shaking their wings and flying in the wind.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes occasionally, and I saw several clumps of silver chrysanthemums gathered together, blooming so brightly. Because we don't like yellow chrysanthemums, there are only purple and white ones here. The fence had been broken by the wind, and the entire chrysanthemum bed looked a bit desolate. Beside the chrysanthemum bed was a damp and winding stream. On the other side of the stream was a thatched pavilion. In this season of autumn wind and falling leaves, everything was dyed with the atmosphere of autumn.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I left home, I cried to my heart's content here. Later, when I heard my mother calling me, I hurriedly wiped away my tears, but I didn't dare to go directly to my mother's side, and only hesitated by the window. When my mother asked me questions, I answered through the window. At this time, there were a few swallows chirping on the beam. I felt that my voice was also as unclear as the swallows' chirping, but the swallows were happy, while I was carrying a crying mood. This mood may not have completely disappeared even now! However, I have returned home.</p>
<p>——Home, this is what I have been missing for the past two years, and what I have been searching for alone in countless similar dreams. Two years cannot be considered a very long period, but this time when I came home, everyone said that I had changed. My mother told me that I was thinner than before, less childish, and saw a little bit of melancholy in my expression that she didn't want to see. I said maybe it was because I missed home too much. My mother asked me again and again if I had encountered anything unpleasant in the past two years; whether I had a feeling of being helpless after leaving home; whether there were any unexpected shocks and hardships on the journey. She stroked my hand and asked me with a smile, why are my eyes always teary, I still can't get rid of my childish temper, so I simply leaned in my mother's arms and cried bitterly. I didn't encounter anything unpleasant, but mother, after more than two years of separation, I have a deeper understanding of the warmth that the family gives me, and a deeper understanding of my mother's affection for me, it is truly engraved in my heart!</p>
<p>It wasn't just me who changed this time, the whole family has changed a bit. My brother is already a complete adult, and my mother's cloud-like temples have also added a lot of silver threads. Even the small garden I dreamed of no longer has its former appearance. I stood beside the messy chrysanthemum bed, the distant scenery was hazy with smoke. The sun had revealed the pale color of the day after tomorrow. I walked along the stream and went all the way to the stone steps of the pavilion. I sat there, watching the leisurely stream, I wanted to see in the stream what changes I have made, but the stream was always gurgling, making me unable to see my own shadow clearly. Gradually, I forgot my original intention, my eyes followed a fallen leaf, drifting to a distant place.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a past impression floated in my heart again, the situation was almost exactly the same as now, but how different was my mood at that time! At that time, my mother, my brother, and I were sitting together in the pavilion. I don't know how, my mother suddenly remembered to ask us about our future aspirations. My brother said that he hoped to travel all over the world, and after experiencing a career, return home to show filial piety to his mother. I said that I don't have such a big wish, I would feel very happy as long as I can always be with my mother. Later, we did a kind of test. Each person picked a flower and threw it into the stream. Whoever's flower drifted far away meant that they would have a wandering life in the future. As a result, as soon as I threw my flower down, it was tripped by the stream grass, while my brother's flower floated all the way to the end of the stream. We were all so happy that we clapped our hands, as if our future destiny had been decided here. But in fact, in the past few years, my brother has been near the family, but I have been more than a thousand miles away from my mother. What will the future years be like? That is truly an elusive mystery!</p>
<p>But returning home, everything is stable after all. We returned from a life of moving with joy and sorrow to a life of leisure and simplicity, from passion to warmth. Even this barren garden has a kind of intimate local flavor. Look at the few bird nests on the elm tree over there, still as before, and the sparrows on the broken walls are still singing happily. All this symbolizes how peaceful and satisfying! Let me be as happy as them! We are reunited now, whether in reality or in dreams, we have obtained what we longed for, let us step with brisk steps and seek our happiness!</p>
<p>In this way, I embraced a full of new hope, carrying the setting sun, and ran to my house!</p>

<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>Without my hometown, I am not saddened, for I know that one day soon I will be able to happily tread upon those lands, searching for the footprints I left in my childhood – covered with a layer of blood, and also covered with a layer of glory.</p>
<p>As if in a medieval dream, a line of dilapidated city walls swirls before my eyes. Facing this structure, once used for attack and defense but now a mere ruin, I can't help but sigh. In the years of raging war, I left this place of fond memories; now, with victory won, I began a journey back to my hometown by chance, though for such a short time. Amidst the rapid current of time, I felt that the people in my village had suffered enough in this great upheaval. From the overcast, I saw the spring-colored clouds; in the desert, I saw fragrant grasses and oases. It was a dream, not left in memory, but just a scar, a brand seared by fire, those are the footprints on the snow – left to time by time.</p>
<p>The old house after the calamity, the house where I had spent some of the beginning years of my life. The winding corridors were entwined with elegant window lattices, lingering with the splendor of the past, and inevitably covered with the faint webs of spiders. Outside the window lattice, a field of green rice paddies, indeed the mountains stones, and the rolling river.</p>
<p>The golden setting sun painted the dilapidated window lattices, the city walls, and the river surface. Just as dusk was dressing up, one could listen to the distant flute sounds of the shepherd boys, clear and profound, a solo of infinitely intoxicating vitality. The shepherd boy passed by the door, jumped down, tied the rope pierced through the ox's nose to the root of the tree beside him, and would gently say "Good evening" to me, his eyes radiating depth.</p>
<p>In the distance, several thatched cottages dyed with a strong primitive flavor, all the tunes of life were being played here, so simple and carefree.</p>
<p>At night, the azure forest, like blue steel, draped joy over the night sky, and the river flowed towards the distant horizon.</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, I invigorated myself, and the knot of anger that had been stuck in my chest for the past few years slowly melted away.</p>
<p>My heart was clearly illuminated.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Offering Flowers <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Song Mengqin</p>
<p>In recent years, my flower vase has often been empty.</p>
<p>The room lacked beautiful spring scenery, and also lacked refreshing autumn colors. Living there, if there was no strong stimulus from the heat or cold, I would forever be muddle-headed and unaware of winter and summer. Friends all said that lingering in this room could make one forget the years. But who knows that this desolation, this emptiness, this lack of vitality, is not by choice?</p>
<p>I love flowers the most. Cut flowers are rarely seen in the north. When I was a child living in a northern city, I could only secretly break off a few branches of magnolia, chrysanthemum, or plum from the garden to put in a vase. If my father ever noticed, he would always scold me for being a selfish child.</p>
<p>After coming south, the first good impression that entered my mind was the constant sound of flower sellers in the streets, which not only reduced the scolding for secretly breaking off flowers from the garden, but also gave me endless leisure and aesthetic pleasure from that clear, sweet, and gentle tone. There was not a day that I didn't get up early, not a day that I didn't secretly open the side door to buy a few bunches to carefully put in the vase, a task that would often sacrifice the entire morning.</p>
<p>Day after day, month after month, year after year passed, and strangely enough, offering flowers did not give me any aesthetic comfort, but only layered up the crux of doubt. I wondered if it was because the flowers in the north were easier to arrange, or if my flower arranging skills as a child were better than now? Was this change in the flowers, or in the flower arranger? Why could I never be satisfied, even with arranging flowers every day?</p>
<p>Experience is like this: a vase on a high table in the corner of the room is easier to be satisfied with; you only need to arrange a few branches in a staggered manner, and it will not lose a kind of pure and tranquil charm. A vase on a desk against the wall is also relatively easy to make barely satisfactory, as long as you take care of the beautiful points on three sides. Only a vase on a table in the middle of the room! For years, it has never been possible to be satisfied with it. If you arrange the front well, there will inevitably be omissions in the back; if you pay attention to the left side, you will surely find unevenness on the right side; even if you can barely succeed on all four sides, when you stand in front of the table and look down occasionally, that kind of messy and unsightly appearance will give you the greatest disappointment.</p>
<p>Because of this, I have smashed flower vases, scolded servants, and also crushed fresh flower branches.</p>
<p>I remember a friend smiling and comforting me: "Why bother! You only need to decorate the side facing the door carefully, so that people who just enter the room will have a good impression at first sight, and preconceived notions will naturally arise in their hearts, making them feel that there is beauty everywhere. Why be so perfectionist?"</p>
<p>My brother advised me: "You only need to arrange the side opposite the sofa you usually sit on artistically, because only you can truly understand yourself. Why be serious about the rest!"</p>
<p>My father said with a smile: "This child really has some obsessions! Let me ask you, is there anything in the world that is perfect? Even if there is, it still has the limits of perfection, and what about one in ten thousand and one?" My father said, patting me on the shoulder, and I also smiled inexplicably.</p>
<p>My flower vase has been empty for a long time under a cloud of doubt and hesitation. Every time I see it, a feeling of sadness and anxiety makes me feel lost.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Formalism in Acting <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Zi</p>
<p>This school of theatre is represented by Meyerhold, who opposed psychological theatre and raised the banner of new aesthetics and new ethics. He was an enemy of naturalism, unwilling to reproduce real life, and created a special stage world, concentrating and refining the atmosphere of modern life through honed formal techniques. Therefore, his position is in clear opposition to the Moscow Art Theatre. He was originally a member of the earliest group in this theatre and worked with it for four years. But later he discovered that this theatre did not fit his ideals, and left because he was thoroughly dissatisfied with the methods used. He felt that Stanislavski's naturalistic expression restricted the expression of the stage and could not get a response from the audience. He believed that the duty of theatrical expression lay in expressing and conveying to the audience.</p>
<p>In his theatre, the director is the center. It can be said that the entire performance is dominated by Meyerhold's strong and poetic personality. Therefore, he calls himself the "author of the performance." In order to express this personality, he takes full responsibility for expressing his ideas. He observes life from his own special angle. Playwrights, actors, stage scenery, furniture arrangement, props, lighting, and colors are all only for him to express his ideas. He leads them, guiding them with a firm and unwavering hand. Therefore, Meyerhold once said: "The most precious thing in art is the work created by the artist with his own spirit. The content of the artwork is the artist's spirit. The actor on the stage is like the clay placed in front of the sculptor, and must, like the sculptor, make the content - the eruption of his own spirit and his feelings - concrete in a clear form. For...the actor, his spirit must be assisted as if explained to the audience - this is the only mission of acting." For Meyerhold, acting is not a realistic and active reflection, but a form of self-expression. The so-called objective world is just a creation that is essentially different.</p>
<p>Meyerhold had long felt that theatrical art must be independent, and that playwrights and directors should have the freedom to interpret the script. This led him to bolder conclusions. Therefore, he believed that all kinds of changes made to the script were unavoidable and legitimate. And during the October Revolution, because of the lack of suitable plays, he decided to create some himself. Based on theatrical history, he believed that theatres should have their own playwrights, so he himself took on the role of the absent playwright.</p>
<p>In terms of basic artistic methods in performance, he proposed the principle of conditionality, which was used as a fighting weapon against naturalism. He hated the reproduction of naturalistic phenomena, believing it to be crude and ugly. Therefore, he once said in "Collected Essays on Theatre": The audience in the theatre "is not coming to see real life, but to see human art. But how can the repetition of oneself on the stage be called art? The audience is craving fiction and acting. Simply giving them a repetition of oneself is just real life or slavish imitation." He paid special attention to external techniques in order to oppose the internal techniques of the art theatre. He said that any art is conditional, and that the purpose of acting, like all other arts, is not a life reflection of a certain worldview, but the explanation of the author's, director's, and actor's outlook on life. Therefore, he said, "The clarity of the image does not necessarily require strict depiction. The static acting technique is more important for the simplicity of gestures and the economy of movement than the entirety of gestures."</p>
<p>Therefore, he proposed a stylized and stylized creative method. He believed that the naturalistic method of treatment was too complex and too detailed. The purpose of naturalism was to express real life, while concealing the inner spirit of life. It only expressed the phenomena of things and hid the activities behind things. His opinion was that the performance of a play should show activity or spirit. For this purpose, it should be simple, extremely concentrated and concise, rather than too detailed, dispersed and redundant. If one wants to successfully convey the perfect spirit, one should try to put the spirit or activity on the stage instead of things or real life. This requires the thorough elimination of details in real life and historical details, seeking the greatest possible generalization of the era and phenomena, and exposing the hidden characteristics with all means of expression, seeking their clear inner meaning. This kind of spirit or activity is the essence extracted by the performer for the sake of theatrical communication, creating a good style. A good style on the stage can make everything belonging to the real world equally belong to the spirit and the soul. Understanding this can convey important experiences using symbols and hints. He restricts all expressive objects and media, and uses these objects to interpret. Therefore, the ideas of conditionality, generalization, and symbol are inextricably linked to the concept of stylization.</p>
<p>Meyerhold spent his life seeking the true way of theatrical communication. He constantly explored new methods that approached the structure of the script, and attempted to theatricalize the theatre and dramatize the drama. He focused on extracting the essence of the drama from the script, and exhausted every possible method to fully convey it to the audience. If we examine the progress of his work path, we will know that it is completely based on the search for unified symbols to convey the highest form of theatrical expression. His consistent problem was how to improve the level of understanding in the theatre, so that the important meaning of the script could be conveyed without any loss. He often said: "There are two things that are most important in the performance of a play. First, we must explore the author's ideas, and then we must express these ideas in a theatrical form. This form, we call it the 'theatrical center', and we build the performance around this center."</p>
<p>But the plan and attempt of acting is the work of the director, starting from himself and practicing a subjective view of art. The actor is a practitioner, a soulless puppet. The actor is not the creator of the image, but a mechanical practitioner of the living image. Removing the spirit of the actor establishes the dictatorship of the performer's creation. Therefore, talking about the performance of the actor cannot be separated from his theory and practice. Based on the principle of conditionality, and dramatizing the drama, he began by praying to integrate the audience and the actor, requiring the stage to be a mysterious connection for the audience, giving the audience the highest theatrical performance communication. Therefore, during the experimental period, he called on the actors to perform directly to the audience on a shallow stage, always thinking in their minds that they were in the theatre. The audience also thought this way when watching the play. The actor must eliminate all real life from the stage, and simplify the technique as much as possible. The audience uses their own imagination to complete the creation of the hints given by the stage, even if there are only a few. It is better for the actor to underact than to overact, and it is better to say less than to say unnecessary things. The audience must supplement what is implied with their own language. At the same time, he developed the musical ideal applied to the theatrical form, and he coordinated the actor's movements with music, creating the plasticity of the movements. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e183">The Mystery of Movie Titles <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ming</p>
<p>During the time when this great war was spreading, every film company in Hollywood, in order to adapt to the environment, constantly produced many war films with propaganda significance and news documentaries filmed on location. The screen was full of gunpowder and fighting scenes. Their intention was to make their own people know how bravely the soldiers of their motherland were serving the country and sacrificing themselves, in order to awaken the people of the whole country to unite and resist the enemy! On a grander scale, to let people around the world know the greatness of America's human and material contributions in this great war. As mentioned before, many such films have been shown in Shanghai after the victory. Such as: "The Lone Ranger", "Fighting Lady", "Flying Tigers", "Heart of a Nation", "Immortal Battalion", etc.</p>
<p>Assuming that "The Lone Ranger" is a powerful army force, and "Fighting Lady" is the alias of a giant aircraft carrier, then "Flying Tigers" is an air force that is famous around the world and has repeatedly made great achievements on the Far East front, and is most familiar to the Chinese people. The above movies include the army, navy, and air force!</p>
<h3 id="e184">Americans Look at Chinese Farmers <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Xiong</p>
<p>In "China Shall Rise"</p>
<p>In "China Shall Rise," we can see that there are several scenes that do not conform to Chinese customs, which is because Americans do not understand us well enough; at least the screenwriter and director of this film are not familiar with China.</p>
<p>In the film, there is such a scene: the father holds the plow, the mother leads the ox, and this old couple is plowing in the field; their daughter - a modernly dressed female student - gets out of the car and runs forward to call out "Papa" and "Mama".</p>
<p>China is an agricultural country, with farmers accounting for 90 percent of the national population; the vast majority of farmers till the land of small landlords, giving 50 percent of the harvest to the landlord; among this small collection, they still have to pay taxes and public expenses in the village, and the remaining grain is truly a small number among a small number. It is extremely rare for a tenant farmer to be able to work twenty mu of land. Most people work more than ten mu of land. It is impossible to support a family with the small collection of more than ten mu of land. How can they afford to send their children to school?</p>
<p>Self-cultivating farmers who are slightly better off mostly cultivate about thirty mu of land; if there are no helpers in the family, they have to hire short-term workers during the busy farming season. Although their lives are more comfortable than those of tenant farmers, they definitely do not have extra money to send a daughter to college. Most parents in our rural areas believe that daughters belong to other people's families, and will never spend a lot of money to send a daughter to school. Even for boys, they can only go to elementary school for three to five years at most. Otherwise, how could China have more than 90 percent illiteracy?</p>
<p>The lives of small landlords mostly depend on exploiting tenant farmers. If they have one or two hundred mu of land, then there are ten tenant farmers shedding blood and sweat to support them. Although they have money to send their children to school, they will not let their children receive secondary or higher education. They think that being able to keep accounts and write letters is enough. Why must they graduate from middle school and university? Anyway, being an official does not depend on knowledge, but on personal connections. If the parents' minds are not stubborn and they have modern ideas, then their children can receive more education, but they have no connection with university, at most only high school. Because the parents cannot afford their children's university education expenses.</p>
<p>The Chinese old couple depicted in "China Shall Rise" will definitely not be small landlords; because small landlords are unwilling to go to their own fields to cultivate; so, at most, they are just self-cultivating farmers. Is it not a strange thing to have a daughter in a self-cultivating farmer's family receiving higher education outside?</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn't matter in the United States, but it is different in China. Chinese farmers rely on a pair of hands to work in the fields, and the efficiency of work is limited; the United States uses machines to farm, and the harvest they get from using machines to farm can of course have extra money to let their children go to school. At the same time, they are a progressive country, and men and women are equal, so education is also equal. What about China? The amount of harvest from manual labor will definitely not exceed the performance of machine harvest; at the same time, gender equality is just a sign for the intellectual class to benefit society for both men and women, and it does not exist in the countryside and all families; this is related to economic conditions.</p>
<p>Therefore, this point in "China Shall Rise" is just an imagination in the minds of Americans, not our Chinese situation. From this, we can see that Americans do not have a real understanding of our Chinese rural economy, farmer life, the feudal consciousness that has not been eliminated, and the old concept of valuing men over women. Their so-called understanding is only a superficial layer!</p>
<h3 id="e185">Prospects for the Experimental Drama School <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Zhongyi</p>
<p>The Municipal Experimental Drama School has been established since last November, and it has been seven months. Of those seven months, two were spent on renovations, and the spring semester has lasted nearly four months. Soon, summer vacation will begin. Although only a little over seven months have passed from its inception to now, the hardships and struggles could fill a book. I plan to start writing this book when I have some free time in the future, as a precedent for those who run drama schools later, hoping to reduce some of the unwarranted suffering and avoid many detours. However, at present, things are still chaotic and I am overwhelmed, so writing it down now would not be presentable. Nevertheless, in order to give the public a clear understanding of the drama school, I must give a rough overview of the current situation.</p>
<p>(1) Facilities</p>
<p>The drama school is located in the former First Japanese National Primary School at the northern end of Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road. It is a large four-story Western-style building. The ground floor houses offices, a carpentry workshop, an electrical workshop, a dining hall, a reception room, the student union office, and a social room. The second floor contains classrooms, rehearsal rooms, a singing room, and a library. The third floor is the Municipal Museum. The fourth floor includes a small theater, student dormitories, and storage rooms. In front of the school building is a playground and a sports field. There is a swimming pool in the back.</p>
<p>The equipment inside the building has not been fully furnished due to funding constraints. For example, the carpentry workshop only has a few old set pieces, the electrical workshop is completely empty, the classrooms are filled with small desks and chairs (left over from the Japanese primary school), and the library contains mostly Japanese books, except for a small number of newly purchased scripts. Only the small theater has been largely completed, with a stage depth of 24 feet and a width of 28 feet. The lighting equipment and curtains are mostly adequate. It has been used for one public performance, staging several one-act plays.</p>
<p>(2) Departments</p>
<p>Currently, there are regular and research programs. The regular program is divided into drama and film departments, each with technical and acting groups. The research program focuses on research in writing and directing. Applicants must have a university degree or equivalent qualifications, experience in writing and directing, and the ability to read English and French directly. The regular program requires a junior high school education, but there are also high school graduates and university dropouts. Currently, there are over ninety students in the regular program and only three in the research program.</p>
<p>(3) Faculty</p>
<p>The only thing the drama school can be proud of is that all the full-time professors and the director are the nation's top theatrical figures. Mr. Wu Renzhi is our director of academic affairs and a lecturer. Mr. Huang Zuolin is the director of our drama department and a professor of basic rehearsal and directing techniques. Mr. Zhang Junxiang is the director of our film department and a professor of basic rehearsal and directing guidance. Mr. Li Jianwu is the director of our experimental theater and a professor of script analysis and selected famous plays. Other professors include Shi Tuo, Yu Nanqiu, Ru Ji, Hu Xin'an, Yan Gongshang, Sokolsky, Chen [blank], and Lu Baike, who teach important subjects such as literary history, introduction to art, makeup, stage technology, rehearsal, Mandarin Chinese, dance, and singing, respectively.</p>
<p>There are also special training courses outside of the curriculum, such as Kunqu opera studies and piano training, taught by experts like Bi Bing [blank] and Pan Meibo. Morning exercises are held at 7:15 a.m., and ball sports are played at 4:00 p.m., with guidance from experts such as Mr. Cao Yu and Mr. Wang Jihuai.</p>
<p>(4) Performances</p>
<p>In just seven months, there have already been two official public performances. The first was in early March at the Lyceum Theatre, staging "Beacon Fire in the Ancient City," written by Mr. Gu Yiqiao and directed by Mr. Wu Renzhi and Mr. Hu Xin'an. The second was at the end of May in the school's small theater, staging two one-act plays, "The Executioner" and "Fiancés." The third public performance is planned for the beginning of the summer vacation, with the program tentatively set as "Compatriot Sisters" and three one-act plays before the opening, "Gilding," directed by Mr. Hu Xin'an, Ji Zuolin, and Wu Renzhi, respectively.</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>This drama school, which is just beginning to take shape, still faces many difficult problems. These difficult problems require not only the continued efforts of all the teachers and students but also the support of the public. Now, I will write down the most important issues below:</p>
<p>(1) Urgent Need to Add Books and Equipment: Books and all technical equipment are the soul of the drama school, but the Bureau of Education, due to budget constraints, has no dedicated funds to allocate to us for the purchase of books and technical equipment. Of course, the more funds we need this time, the better, but at a minimum, we need around two million yuan to achieve even a basic scale.</p>
<p>(2) Not Enough Full-Time Professors: The Bureau of Education stipulates that there are only twelve full-time teachers. According to the current situation, this is not enough. The professors of many important subjects are still part-time. Next semester, at least two more classes will be added, and at least one-third more full-time professors will be needed. In addition, singing and dance professors should also be full-time so that they can have individual teaching time.</p>
<p>(3) Society Does Not Value Drama Enough: Our compatriots still look down on drama, and often prevent their children from studying at drama school. As a result, many talented people cannot enroll because they cannot get their family's consent, and many young people with aspirations in drama drop out halfway due to family opposition. Drama education is truly the most effective tool in social education, and engaging in drama is the noblest profession. Actors are artists, not ordinary "entertainers." This poses a great obstacle to the drama school. Society is not sympathetic enough to the drama school, and young people who aspire to study drama do not have enough freedom to choose their careers.</p>
<p>(4) Too Few Publicly Funded Spots: Many young people who study drama are poor, and the number of publicly funded spots in the school is too small (due to funding constraints), so many poor but aspiring young people cannot enter. The drama school hopes that the public can sympathize and provide loans, and plans to hold practical performances, using the income and profits as living allowances for poor students. On the other hand, it hopes that the government will understand the importance of drama education and provide many public-funded spots in particular.</p>
<p>Whether the drama school has a future depends entirely on whether the many difficult problems above can be solved smoothly in the shortest possible time. Our own strength is very weak, but there are many people in society who show us great sympathy. We hope that they can give us material or spiritual assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Cholera Exports <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Last night, I went to the station to see a friend off. As soon as I entered the station, I saw two tables covered with white cloths, with people in white coats sitting there. This was a team dedicated to giving vaccinations to travelers.</p>
<p>It is said that because cholera is rampant in Shanghai, those who buy train tickets must present proof of vaccination. I asked my friend if he had done so, and he said that the ticket was bought by someone else and he had not heard that any proof of vaccination was required. I then went to the traveler exit and looked, but I did not see any personnel checking proof of vaccination.</p>
<p>We know that the Chinese people are behind in intelligence, and their inherent laziness is deeply rooted. Even though getting vaccinated is beneficial to oneself, it often requires coercion. Setting up vaccination teams at train stations, docks, or airports is certainly welcome for any traveler to get vaccinated, but if you don't check the vaccination certificates of travelers entering Shanghai at the exit, how many travelers will take the time out of their busy schedules to take care of the vaccination team! Should we only prohibit cholera "exports" and let cholera "imports" happen?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it seems that travelers who do not buy tickets in the usual places do not need to have proof of vaccination, so even the prohibition of "exports" has "smuggling."</p>
<h3 id="e189">Old Goods Stalls and Bargains <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Gang Ren</p>
<p>Shanghai, of course, has many rich people; but there are even more "people who are made rich," middle and lower-class citizens. Therefore, it is not surprising that there are many old goods stalls.</p>
<p>You can find old books on Fourth Road and Fuxing Road, with every volume complete; buy old clothes on Linsen Road, and you are guaranteed to be satisfied; if you want to buy wooden furniture, of course, go to Pingjili Road, where you can find everything; and Kade Road and Hongkou Qiujiang Road can indeed be called "Old Department Store Companies"; the "out-of-stock" goods sold by the Japanese some time ago should now be the enemy and puppet materials sold by the Jianghai Customs.</p>
<p>In these places, people can often find the suitable and cheap things they need; therefore, business is quite developed. Now that summer has arrived, the evening, when there is no scorching sun, should be the most active time; strolling the streets, enjoying the cool breeze, and "getting cheap goods," what could be better?</p>
<p>However, don't be too happy. If you are too dull, you may be tricked and suffer a loss, and you may even be scolded as "wrongfully dead."</p>
<p>Seeing others boasting about how good and how good the bargains they bought are, people who are willing to be practical and want to save a little money should be tempted!</p>
<p>Therefore, why don't you go there too!</p>
<p>At a glance, you can almost see a smiling face that immediately follows up with a fierce and vicious look.</p>
<p>Upon asking, the price is "sky-high," which first makes you have to be shocked, and quickly "haggle down," but sometimes the price is so high that even if you "haggle down," it is still not very cheap. If he has a bigger air, he will sell it to you, and if you happen to see some minor flaws, you think about it and feel uncomfortable; but just wait for you to hesitate and ask a question! Hum! Then</p>
<p>His eyes will bulge, and his arms will be crossed, "Are you planning to buy it? (!)"</p>
<p>You will have to be forced to buy it uncomfortably, and then walk away amid curses.</p>
<p>There are "good people," but such things are indeed very common.</p>
<p>There are plenty of bargains! Can you "handle" this kind of incident!</p>
<p>Therefore, you must have a method!</p>
<p>Tell you, don't be too greedy for cheap things, because no one in the world is willing to "suffer losses," you must first decide what you want to buy? Do you want to see anything else? How much money are you prepared to spend? (Of course, this refers to a considerable degree of cheapness.) Then go boldly.</p>
<p>Originally, there is no fixed rule for buying old goods; in short, you must have an idea and have vision.</p>
<p>You will never encounter eye-bulging, and you will not expect anything to happen, and you will smoothly bring back "results."</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you are not prepared like this, and you do not have this ability; you must be prepared to receive a scolding, with bulging eyes, "Are you worthy to buy it? (!)"</p>
<p>At that time, are you angry?</p>
<h3 id="e190">Penicillin Allocation - Cancel Control <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The US government is said to be implementing the cancellation of control over the allocation of penicillin in the country starting on July 1st. Therefore, drug merchants sent representatives to hold a meeting with officials in Washington on June 15 to discuss the issue of prohibiting the movement of penicillin in various regions. Because the production of penicillin is currently quite abundant, it is enough for doctors to use. The entire new drug industry in the United States can now produce 200 billion units of penicillin per month, which is four times more than last summer, and the production of 18.38 billion units in February has obviously increased a lot.</p>
<p>As for the control of exports, it seems that it cannot be cancelled at the same time as the cancellation of domestic control. However, according to people in the pharmaceutical industry, it will definitely be cancelled after a considerable period of time. The reason for controlling exports is to prevent large-scale sales from resulting in certain countries purchasing large quantities and reselling them to other countries, profiting from them, which would cause countries that need it to be unable to buy it. According to past situations, it has been confirmed that at least one country has resold imported penicillin to other countries, causing it to be traded on the black market.</p>
<p>Recently, countries around the world need to purchase penicillin from the United States. The Latin American countries that need it may be adequately supplied, but many countries in Europe and the Far East still do not have enough penicillin allocated to them. Letters and telegrams applying for export have been sent to the United States one after another. The pharmaceutical industry believes that adequate quantities can be supplied overseas soon.</p>
<p>Since domestic distribution is no longer controlled, it is important for pharmaceutical merchants to hold meetings to discuss issues related to the production and sales of penicillin. The panic of hospitals lacking penicillin will soon be eliminated, and adequate supplies will be provided. Although the range of penicillin treatment is very wide, people in the American pharmaceutical industry believe that the need in summer will definitely be less than usual.</p>
<p>Regarding the manufacture of penicillin, not only injections, but also tablets and other forms are being actively manufactured for swallowing and topical application. The selling price of penicillin has been quite stable, with no excessive rise or fall. According to people in the pharmaceutical industry, there will not be an excessive increase in the short term, but at the same time, it will not fall sharply. Future changes will only be a few percent up or down.</p>
<p>Currently, oral penicillin is as popular as injections. In terms of the selling price in the United States, a box of twelve tablets containing 300,000 units of penicillin sells for US$2.25, while an injection containing 300,000 units sells for US$1.80. The main reason why tablets are more expensive than injections is that the cost of manufacturing is naturally added to the selling price. Therefore, the selling prices of tablets and injections are different.</p>

<p>Undeliverable Letter</p>
<p>X: In your sweet honeymoon period, please forgive me, the forgotten one, for bothering you for a few more minutes. Do you remember when you got married, you complained about why I didn't go to congratulate you? Miss, when these words entered my ears, the ups and downs of my mood were not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>X: Do you remember when we met, do you remember the dream of the two of us walking under the moon? From that time on, I dare not say that I must think of you every day, but I can say that at least four or five times a day your image has been in my mind, until now, until forever. Although we haven't known each other for long, I can say that I have fallen into an inextricable deep sea. In that sea, I have hope, I have comfort, I have sweetness. Who knows that these have all become the bitter cup of today. Hardships and pain are not the harvest of what was planted before. Who says it's just hardships and pain, shouldn't the heart also wither, the tears also run out, and the fresh blood also burst out?</p>
<p>The moon guarded by the stars is still the same as last year. I remember this day last year, I had to leave Shanghai temporarily because of a factory matter. Like tonight, the night before, you and I slowly paced on the asphalt road. On that quiet road, the branches were playing Qing Festival rhythms for us, the breeze was sending our harmony, and the drizzle was brushing on our faces, making it impossible to tell whether it was worry or sorrow, and it was impossible to express the emptiness in my heart. My mouth whistle was blowing a farewell tune for me. What about you? Without a sound, I was just tightly clinging to my side, and the shining eyes were only expressing attachment to me. No, those were glittering water droplets.</p>
<p>I also held you tightly, holding you as if afraid of losing you. I don't know if it was because of the drizzle. Water droplets also hung on my cheeks, but these were not water droplets.</p>
<p>X: Do you remember how the glasses hidden in my upper pocket were broken, just a silent hug. After saying everything that I wanted to say in my heart, who cares about the glasses that were broken in my pocket? But the movement of the clock broke us apart. Who knew that this farewell would become a permanent farewell. This hateful clock! Why didn't you stop forever at that time?</p>
<p>The victory firecrackers called back the people from other lands, but the victory firecrackers also shattered a heart full of hope.</p>
<p>The returnee, full of joy of reunion, did not even see your face once, until one day I saw your name in the wedding announcement, and at the same time, I received a pair of letters from you. But where is this a letter, it is simply a death warrant - a pink invitation. Fei, having suffered all kinds of humiliating oppression in foreign lands, how could I bear this great blow. You asked me to be sure to attend your wedding banquet. Isn't this like holding a knife to my neck and asking me to go to the guillotine? So, I became decadent, I fell, but the times called me back, and national affairs awakened me. I still have my future!</p>
<p>My eyes are blurred, my heart is sobbing, and my hand, the hand that can convey one ten thousandth of my mood, is also trembling.</p>
<p>I can't think anymore, I can't write anymore, I'm afraid my words will be diluted by my tears. I'm afraid my trembling heart will stop because of this. I'll stop writing here.</p>
<p>Although I have written the letter, who should I send it to? I am disappointed, because the world has already lost a Miss and added a Mrs. How can I send this letter to this Miss? I can only wish you here forever</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>The one you forgot, Huo, midnight, July 8</p>

<p>— Wen Yi</p>
<p>Yesterday, I passed by Henan Road and saw a middle-aged beggar making a very meaningful announcement. He drew a bowl full of rice grains on the sidewalk and wrote: "Alas, although the rice is full, what can I do if I can't take it to fill my hunger!" He also attached a couplet: "Those who are full don't know the suffering of those who are hungry; those with the same face should not laugh at those who are out of luck." It was also very meaningful. For a time, the onlookers were like a wall, but those who generously donated money were still few.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Opinions on the Municipal Library <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>I went to the Municipal Library on Sunday and felt that this repository of spiritual food for the city had many areas that needed improvement:</p>
<p>First, there are more Western books than Chinese books, and there hasn't been much change since it was run by the Public Works Department. Apart from some miscellaneous bound Western-style ancient books and propaganda pamphlets, there isn't much else in Chinese. Even the newspapers are not complete. Not a single new magazine can be seen, which makes readers feel disappointed.</p>
<p>Second, the catalog boxes are all in Western languages. Even if you find an item, you have to ask the staff to find out where the book is located. The catalogs of newly purchased Chinese books are copied in pencil, which is blurred and illegible, and it is also unknown where the books are stored. We hope that the catalog cards can indicate the storage cabinet numbers so that readers can find them immediately upon searching.</p>
<p>Third, library services should not be suspended on Sundays. Although the Municipal Library is still open, all services such as borrowing books are suspended, and the elevator is also not open.</p>
<p>Fourth, the library environment is still quiet, and the layout is very orderly. However, the stairs are full of paper scraps, dust, and dirt, which is unsightly. I imagine that because the elevator goes up and down every day, these small details have been overlooked.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Weak Thief <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Li Sheng</p>
<p>The newspaper on the 9th reported a news item about "Deidro": a beautiful female student from the University of Michigan, "Qi Yue Rushiqi," encountered a thief at night and kicked the gun out of his hand with her jade leg, and tied up the "robber" with her skirt. After reading this, I couldn't help but sigh with emotion:</p>
<p>Ordinary people always add the word "weak" to women, calling them weak women. And the fierce face of a robber always has a hideous appearance in the ideal, which is frightening and terrifying. Now, according to this news, it's not right at all! The robber took out a gun, but was kicked out of the hand by a woman's powder leg. After being kicked out, he didn't even escape, but was bound by the woman with a skirt belt. This is a big failure! A useless person like this can be a law-abiding citizen, but he overestimates himself and insists on being a robber. In fact, how can he be a robber? He is just a pitiful weak thief! It's no wonder that a weak thief immediately made a fool of himself when he met a strong woman.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Explanation of the "Milk Powder and Flour Mystery" <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Hen Xin</p>
<p>The "Free Talk" column on July 9 published an article "The Mystery of Milk Powder and Flour". The author raised two mysterious strange things: First, the milk powder freely distributed to students by the Executive Yuan contained fine sand and had sediment. Was it really shipped from the United States by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and why did it not taste like Carnation milk powder? Second, the neighborhood chief instructed residents to collect flour, but when they took their flour sacks to collect it, the neighborhood chief replied that it was notified by the ward chief, and the ward chief replied to ask the neighborhood chief, causing that friend to run around for nothing.</p>
<p>In fact, these two things are not strange. I might as well explain them from the perspective of a commoner and see if these meanings are different from what the responsible authorities said.</p>
<p>The milk powder distributed to students by the Executive Yuan was indeed shipped from the United States, but it was skim milk (Carnation milk powder is whole milk), which can only fill the stomach and has no nutritional value. After these relief milk powders were shipped to Shanghai, they were probably left in the warehouse. When the relief officials remembered it, the milk powder had already deteriorated (milk powder is very easy to spoil, even whole milk is the same. The milk powder that the students received had already formed hard lumps the size of pebbles when they received it), so naturally, there would be sedimentation or sour taste. "Oranges across the Huai River become trifoliate oranges," so don't blame others, just blame yourself for not having the luck to eat good food.</p>
<p>The common people originally looked forward to receiving household flour as much as they looked forward to rain after a long drought. Therefore, the author hurriedly ran around, but why couldn't he receive it in the end? Probably the ward chief felt sorry for the people. Since receiving flour was not a fact and he had no ability to distribute it himself, he deliberately said so to give the common people the hope and happiness of a cloud. As for shirking responsibility afterwards, it can be said to be an inherent habit of the officialdom, so there is no need to be surprised. On the other hand, the author, who longed for Qing American milk powder and household flour but was disappointed, is very pitiful!</p>
<h3 id="e197">Milk Powder Ration <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Delin</p>
<p>I read your esteemed publication's July 9th article, "The Mystery of Milk Powder and Flour," which mentioned that consuming rationed milk powder can cause diarrhea. I have had a similar experience and consulted a doctor, who said, "Milk powder currently sold on the market, such as Carnation, Horlicks, and Golden State, are all whole milk powders with a high fat content. Consuming too much can be difficult for the stomach to digest, and a slight chill can cause diarrhea. For ordinary adults, the daily limit for milk powder consumption is generally one tael (approximately 37.5 grams), and excessive consumption is not suitable. For children, whose digestive systems are weaker, the amount should be reduced accordingly. Regular milk powder consumption can easily lead to constipation, so it is necessary to eat fruit occasionally to aid digestion.</p>
<p>When preparing milk powder, it is common to use a small amount of cold or lukewarm boiled water to dissolve the milk powder, stirring thoroughly with chopsticks or a teaspoon to ensure no undissolved particles remain. Then, gradually add boiling water while continuing to stir with chopsticks or a teaspoon. If this process is not followed carefully and undissolved particles remain, yellow clumps will float to the surface, and the milk powder will coagulate, making it difficult to digest. This requires careful attention.</p>
<p>As for the milk powder currently being rationed to students—skim milk powder—it contains no fat, is white in color, and has a fine texture, unlike whole milk powder, which has a yellowish tint. When mixed with water, it does not coagulate. When mixed with boiling water, a layer of white substance settles at the bottom, and it has a slightly sour taste, suggesting it has spoiled. No wonder students do not like to eat it.</p>

<h3 id="e198">To My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (6) <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>As the sun began to set, a clerk from a silk and satin store, acting on the orders of Zou Jinglao, delivered a large package of materials for funeral garments. There were Sheng spun fabrics, plain silk, soft satin, a vibrant mix of red and green that was truly beautiful. Bao Mei measured the dimensions and found them to be perfectly accurate, and because they were meant to be particularly loose-fitting, each piece was generously sized. The quality of the materials was also exceptionally good. If you could have opened your eyes to see it, you would surely have been pleased. Gen Yun, the son of , has always made clothes for our family. He also put in extra effort, enlisting five of his fellow tradesmen to diligently work on your funeral garments. He was quite optimistic, saying it would bring you good luck. However, the sound of the knives and rulers constantly reaching my ears simply shattered my heart. They worked together until three o'clock, almost finishing the work when a miracle suddenly occurred. Your body, which had been lying stiff and motionless all day and night, suddenly moved. Your eyes, which had been tightly closed all day and night, suddenly opened, two watery eyes staring directly at my face, as if awakening from a long dream. This sudden miracle, most likely bestowed by God, drove all of us mad with joy, even Gen Yun put down his knife and ruler. , anxiously ran to see you, his rush . After you awoke, you did not sleep again. We gave you medicine, rice porridge, and orange juice, all of which you drank without issue. For some reason, your spirits were particularly high that night. You kept talking to us, calling out to one person and then another, as if all the children were by your side. But aside from Peng'er, who was studying in Suzhou, they had all gone to Shanghai after wishing you a happy birthday. Seeing you talking so much, we feared you would tire yourself out and tried to persuade you to rest, but you would resume talking within a minute or two of stopping. You said to Bao Mei: "I had a very long dream. In the dream, I was walking alone along a bumpy road, one foot high and one foot low, which was very difficult to walk. I met my mother and our Rong'er on the road." Hearing this, we couldn't help but shudder. We knew that you had already walked the road to the underworld and met deceased relatives. Perhaps because our fate was not yet exhausted, you returned? At that moment, I couldn't help but secretly thank God for returning my twenty-nine-year-old companion who I was about to lose!</p>
<p>That night, I was joyfully sleepless, as sweet as on our wedding night thirty years ago. I stayed close to your side, reluctant to leave your bed. My eyes were glued to your face, reluctant to look away, sitting there until dawn. Experiencing the return of a priceless treasure after losing it, nothing in life could bring more joy than this. After dawn, I immediately wrote a letter to Zou Jinglao, reporting this unexpected good news, and also asked him to invite the renowned Western-trained doctor Yu Qihua to come and treat you. For the entire morning, I kept trying to coax you to sleep, but you remained wide awake, still chattering non-stop. One moment, you would call for Yun'er, asking if he had eaten his snack. The next, you would call for Shijing, asking if his three children were well. Then you would call for Bao Mei and Ye Ma, asking them why they weren't going to sleep. Since you were always worried and anxious, which led to this serious illness, I took advantage of this moment of near-death revival to advise you to seek pleasure and enjoyment from now on, and not to create trouble for yourself. You glanced at me with a mixture of surprise and joy and said, "You pig-head, what do I have to be unhappy about!" This "pig-head" made everyone laugh. Even though I was scolded, I was secretly pleased, feeling like I was back in the joyful, teasing days of our honeymoon.</p>
<p>My shock had subsided, my heart began to bloom, and I naturally regained my appetite. Around one-thirty in the afternoon, Zheng'er and Ling'er received a long-distance phone call and telegram, and they rushed back from Shanghai in fear. I heard them and went out to greet them. As soon as they saw me, they anxiously asked how their mother was, and tears started to fall.</p>
<p>I smiled and comforted them, saying, "Congratulations! Congratulations! Mother is out of danger." Then I led them into the room to see you. When you saw them, you were perfectly lucid, still recognizing your beloved son and daughter. You didn't know they had just come from Shanghai, and we didn't tell you, fearing that knowing you had escaped death would add to the stress. At three o'clock, Zou Jinglao kindly came with Doctor Yu. I was overjoyed and quickly asked Doctor Yu to examine you. After the examination, the doctor said that the illness was severe, had affected the heart, and was in a state of extreme weakness. For the time being, it was necessary to proceed steadily, starting with strengthening the heart. Once the heart was strengthened, blood transfusions could be used to help. I thought this sounded right and entrusted the important responsibility of saving you entirely to him. Doctor Yu then wrote a prescription very carefully and also ordered German vitamin B and C injections, to be given along with heart-strengthening injections the next day. For the next four days, we gave you injections and medicine every day, doing everything we could to proceed steadily. During those four days, you were sometimes very clear-headed and sometimes a bit confused. When you spoke to us, two-thirds of what you said made sense, while one-third seemed abnormal. You often repeated the same sentence several times, mostly advising us to eat nutritious foods, saying the word "vitamin" over and over. Zheng'er and Ling'er patiently served you medicine and stayed by your side. You once said to Bao Mei, "I think I am happy. My husband is good, and my children are good, especially Zheng. He is my heart!" Zheng'er, hearing this from the side, couldn't help but cry. In fact, you loved me, you loved all six of your children; who did you not love, who was not your heart?</p>
