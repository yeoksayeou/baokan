<h3>長春外圍激戰兩日　共軍一部侵入市區　四平街國軍繼續北進</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十六日電〕據長春保安團司令陳家珍電稱：長春蘇軍十四日上午十一時三十分完全撤退，自十二時起，共軍在外圍開始攻擊，十五日夜一時機塲被共軍佔領，圍攻市區極爲激烈，十六日晨六時，共軍一部已侵入市區。又此間電局十六日曾先後聽到長春電局與錦州重慶通報，情勢危急。下午三時以後，即未再總到長春之呼號，想長市電源已斷絕，情况不明。又長春，哈爾濱問電話已不通。</p>
<p>〔又電〕據此間關係方面接獲消息：長春市區經共軍砲擊，死傷甚衆。長春城防司令陳家珍，率領所部固守孤立之市區，以寡搏衆，戰鬥至爲激烈。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十六日電〕今日北平與瀋陽來訊，顯示共軍已佔領長春郊外之飛機塲三處，並自許多方面衝入此一東北要城，致使國軍七千人被迫向滿洲煤炭大厦一帶撤退。</p>
<p>〔聯合社瀋陽十六日電〕東北保安司令部宣布，美式配備新一軍主力，今晨十時入四平街，當繼續向長春推進，以援救長春守軍。此間現擬派遣中立飛機一架至長春，救出美國報界五男一女記者。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十六日電〕國府軍事發言人稱：長春國軍衆寡懸殊，刻仍抵抗共軍之圍攻。該支國軍僅數千人，以新六軍居多，另有少數保安除。今夜此間傳，國府原來撥出載運，官員還都之飛機，或將改運特種軍隊往長春，但此說未獲證實。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津十五日電〕臨楡錦州問前所·萬家屯·高嶺三車站，共軍十五日已驅退，現正搶修路軌中，三二日即可恢復通車。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐的十六日電〕聯合國機構中國代表郭泰祺昨稱：中國政府幷無將東北衝突提交安全理事會討論之意，但希望調處代表到達東北及馬歇爾特使回華後，戰事能即停止。</p>
<h3>蘇高等法院滿坑滿谷　爭看頭號女漢奸　陳逆璧君當庭自稱願就死</h3>
<p>〔本報特派記者蘇州十六日電〕蘇州高等法院，昨日下午二時廿五分審訊陳逆璧君，旁聽者人山人海，即被吿席亦爲旁聽者所佔。審判長孫鴻霖，首席推事石美瑜，推事陸家瑞，檢察官韋維淸，書記官秦道立等升座時，全法庭中已滿坑滿谷，即法警亦幾無立足之地。陳逆于開庭後，由法警及憲兵護衛，自人叢中擠入，身穿藍布旗袍，神態頗爲興奮，而面色紅潤，聲音高朗，不似久患疾病者，經審判長訊問年齡籍貫後，檢察官即起立宣吿起訴意旨：陳逆當庭答辯，手持其事先撰就之辯護書，滔滔不休，蓋尙欲利用旁聽者惻隱之心，鼓其如簧之舌，以遂其狡展之目的。至激動時，無知聽衆竟有鼓掌者，爲庭上呵斥始止。審判長旋即詢問一過，並示證件，交陳逆自在閱，三時五十分，宣吿調査證據完畢。檢察官起而論吿，陳逆自加答辯，更見其振振有辭，空氣極形緊張，庭中秩序益形紊亂，旋即由公職辯護人高溶循例代爲辯護一過，四時三十五分，審判長宣吿辯論終結，定本月廿二日下午三時宣判，與褚逆宣判之時間相同，乃宣吿退庭，旁聽者爭先恐後，擠出法院時，高院某高級職員吿記者曰：「今日秩序之壞，實開高院成立後之新紀錄也」。</p>
<h3>高法院內秩序紊亂　陳逆儼如演說家　韋檢察官舉出四大罪狀</h3>
<p>陳逆係於二時廿分於憲警嚴密戒備下，由看守所用馬車解到，其女及媳於一時許即至旁聽席，因爲記者包圍，匆匆遁去，開審後始再回入。開庭後，孫院長囑協助雄持秩序之憲兵退出，因法院內不能有武裝之故，然因是而秩序益亂，陳逆到庭時，微含笑容，狀極愉快，儼然一演說家，庭上訊問年齡籍貫時，供稱：年五十六歲，廣東新會人，住廣州法政路三十號。自民國十三年起，任中央黨部監察委員，「一至於今」。家中有二子三女，三孫，庭上問其財產若干，彼即以頗爲不遜之語氣答曰：「統統給政府沒收了，應當比本人査得更淸楚」。後乃答稱：廣州有法政路三十號房子一幢，上海有福履理路五百七十號房子一幢，展東有田地，畝數則已記不淸，南京之房子西康路十八號，「是同志送的，但自己從未住過」。並有股票，惟確數亦已記不淸。</p>
<p>是時，位檢察官即起立稱，被吿係汪逆兆銘之妻，曾任中央監委，中日戰生，隨同汪逆的勾結日酋近衛秘密言和，後並秘密離渝，背叛中央，並用「明」（指汪逆）「崖」（指被告）等密電字樣，與汪駢肩主政，聲勢煊赫。汪逆死後，仍復爲僞組織奔走各地，且密布特工機構，陷害中央人員，並舉事跡四點：（甲）僞廣東省軍政大事，皆取決被吿，用意實在斷絕政府物資來源，削弱抗戰之力量。（乙）收編匪軍，改編前四路軍李棘羣，任用僞員極多，可見同惡想濟之甚，此事發生於僞粵省長陳春圃離職後，褚民誼長粤前之四個月。（丙）僞中央執委會特工首領廖公劭·陳賡廷·簡樹等之情報，均係專報被吿鑒核，足見其主持華南特工情報。（丁）用人行政，惟敵寇之命是從，事事須得”聯絡部長矢崎及軍司令官酒井等之同意，足見其通謀敵國，反抗木國，被告實犯懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款之罪，即請依法審判。</p>
<p>陳逆自辦大放厥詞</p>
<p>檢察官歸座後，庭上即命陳逆自辯，陳逆自知一生之中，此實博取民衆同情之最後機會，遂手持鉛筆，東西指點，大放厥辭，略謂：（甲）彼之回粤，係執行任務，至南京則爲探視其年逾七十之老母及繞膝兒孫，往來京粤，不能即武斷爲故意兩月駐京，兩月駐粤，別具用心。（乙）陳春圃去職後，一方面自主粤政，一方面請褚逆來粤，並無不合，彼在粤時，係在汪逆已死之後，是時盛傳美軍行將登陸，治安搖動，共軍乘機　動，省長辭後，廳長去職者亦多，認爲如不毅然自任，共軍之蔓延與民衆之遭難，必將不堪設想，廣東三千萬人民不能不要，乃冒險回粤，而於三月十二日抵達，四月來皆由彼主持，直至褚逆就職爲止。此時靑黃不接，廣東米價達每擔儲幣十二萬二千元高峯，彼乃與民財建各廳廳長商議後，與日人交涉，飽歷艱辛，始允開放河道，停收軍米，亦不再向民間收米，米價爲之狂跌至每擔五萬二三千，「此正廣東文武同志之勞績，上可以吿總理，下可以對汪先生」。至謂陳耀祖任省長時，每事必向彼報吿者，因係同屋居住，伺志，獨不可相扶乎？（丙）關於特工情報：（一）情報是送給誰的？彼係中監委，陳耀祖係中執委，電報致中執委者，非彼所能負責。（二）「人家送東西給我看，我是否就要負內容的責任？我與情報有無關係是一事，主持情報機關是另一事，如確係我負責，則我已甘心就死，何必抵賴」？（丁）彼等至少已做到了計口授糧，使老百姓有飯吃，爲此等事向日人折衝，辛苦如何，彼等若干事務確須得日本方面之同意，因廣東是日本用軍事力量佔得之地，彼等正努力爲老百姓謀福利，不可稱爲反抗本國。如政府以此等搶救老百姓之勞績爲反抗本國者，彼甘受死刑（至是有一人鼓掌，經法庭制止）。</p>
<p>彼縱乃爲汪辯白，極力推崇，並謂，彼於汪逆死後，仍極「努力」者，因「六中全會」宣言中有「無愧先烈，無負子孫，生死共之……以違反共建國之目的」，故彼不敢在家偸安。彼不願上訴，不願辯護，甘願從容就死，但對其他附逆分子，則亦請庭上從寬發落。</p>
<p>庭上宣告調查完畢</p>
<p>庭上乃開始訊問：答辯最重要之點，是說搜出之特工報吿係致陳耀社而不是你的？（答）不敢說都不是，如果是致中監委陳的，是我的。（問）看見過這些情報嗎？（答）現在沒有，要看一看。（問）收編僞軍張逸舟及前四軍李輔羣二事與聞否？（答）未與聞，但陳耀祖的報告是看見過的。（問）密電暗號「明」，「崖」，「華」等字，「明」是汪，「崖」是你？（答）照電報語氣，汪是「明」，「崖」除了我，沒有誰，「華」則祗有陳耀祖可能。（問）廣東省政，當時是否大小都要同日本人講？（答）大的要，小的不要，大事如軍隊調動，經過日軍防區等等。（問）文武官員調動，須經失崎，酒井等同意？（答）不是同意，是通知，不要忘了這是日軍佔領區，有日本兵三四十萬人。（問）汪由渝而越·而上海·而日本，與日接洽訂的，是否始終與聞？（答）是知道的，但事涉外交，並未參加，我的任務是替老百姓做事。（問）贊成汪的主張？（答）絕對贊成，作此答語時，語氣斬釘截鐵，頗有力量。（問）在南京決定抗戰大計時，汪是贊成的？（答）是，因那時認爲非戰不可。（問）何時起改變主張呢？（答）民國廿六年底，德國大使陶德曼調停中日戰爭時。（問）你們後來又何以到重慶去呢？（答）汪是主張整個政府成爲一體的。（問）旣贊成和平，何以不對中央建義，而先至河內？（答）建議過不知多少次，想走也有六次之多，總是捨不得離開，到第六次才走成了。（問）中央負責人既多數主戰，如何可以一二人即作和平運動？（答）國家正常時可用法定手續，危亡時則不然，而且一個人的意見也不是全國的意見。汪離開後，一直與重慶通電，直至曾仲鳴被殺後，通電始斷。（問）許崇智有書信來往罷？（答）曾勸其到南京或上海米住，不要住香港。（問）卅一年二月八日，你曾在廣東興亞大會演講，有嗎？（答）有的，庭上乃宣讀原文，中有「國事誤於蔣介石之倚賴英美，以致弄到這步田地」，（答）有的。（問）你們主張不要聯絡英美，而要聯日是否？（答）這是根據國父大亞洲主義，如果當年日本不打珍珠港，而向北進，英美會像今天那樣協助我們嗎？此時庭上交閱證件多件。（問）去過日本吾？（答）十七歲時去過，以後央民國卅三年三月三日，汪病了才去看過他。於是庭上宣布調査證據完畢，時爲三時五十分。</p>
<p>與檢察官一塲激辯</p>
<p>韋檢察官乃起而論告，略謂：汪是被告佩服的，但汪之基本觀念旣屬錯誤，學問亦成無用，楊雄·秦檜皆有學問，而品格極卑，在之言行，皆違背中央，不識世界大勢，被吿於淪陷後，確任中執委，中政委，有黨證可査，而特工焉有不殺人之理？所謂不看情報，實係遁辭，至於粤省物價昂貴，被吿等維持地面，未嘗不是，但功亦不能抵過。</p>
<p>陳逆答辯時，神情極爲激奮，據稱：「檢察官的話，十句中我只聽懂了兩句」。網謂：汪之言論及行爲好不好，盡人皆知，所謂「言論好，行爲不好」，「這樣說話是沒有下文的」。不可以成敗論英雄，更不可因其已死，乃橫加誣衊，在的行爲是否有功於國，可以公開問老百姓。又謂：「我從未做過中執委，檢察官一定要我承認，祇好請到黨部去査，文件是可以移動的，省畏常然可以拿到家裘去看，何以因在我家搜出，便硬說是給我的？行政方面，日人之核准與同意是兩件事，日本人不同意的事我們做不成，沒有什麽丢險，地方不是我們丢的！至於情報，一則根本不是給我的，再則就是給我，也不能就算情報是我組織的」。　檢察官常時頗震怒，起立詰詢：「你說不懂，你是懂的！揚雄·秦檜你懂不懂？他們都有學問，秦檜是狀元！」陳亦怒聲答曰：「這裹是法院，所以我不說不客氣的話，狀元不過會起承轉合做做文章，就算有學問嗎？」檢察官稱：「他學問很好。」陳說：「要看一個人的見解，因爲有人打了敗仗，我們才去救孤苦無助的老百姓的。」空氣極形緊張。庭上乃問：「決定抗戰大計時，你說汪是贊成的，抗戰即須有犧牲，要代價。「答：「不得不戰時才要戰，犧牲也要在不得不犧牲時才肯。」問：「基本條約中規定蒙騷華北駐兵，又發表中日滿宣言，東北是不是不要了？」答；「當然不是，條約上的「字』是可以消滅的，祇要大家努力，事實上是想使偽滿投降的，不過沒有做到罷了。」</p>
<h3>一庭辯語　廿二宣判</h3>
<p>於是公職辯護人高溶即起爲辯論一過，略謂：日人如此橫暴，被吿等能勉維治安，不無可原云云。庭上乃宣布辯論終結，定廿二日下午三時宣判，退庭，陳逆仍乘馬車回押。（尙有審訊陳褚兩巡消息請參閱第二版）</p>

<p>安全理事會今日開會後，法代表龐納建議，請求聯合國機構秘書長賴依收集有關伊朗問題之各種情報，俾可提交聯合國大會。賴依當即提出長篇之報吿，論述安理會可吾將伊朗問題留入議程之法律觀點。結果，交由專家委員會審查，限於兩日內連同評語，回呈安理會。美代表史退丁紐斯請求將伊朗問題留入議程內，據稱：此種做法旣不遠書伊朗主權，亦不干涉于蘇伊協定內容。</p>
<p>據消息靈通方面稱：此次伊朗宣佈撤回申訴，實爲不得已之舉。上週末，蘇聯大使曾三訪伊總理，確切聲明蘇軍必可在五月六日前撤離伊朗，伊總理認爲蘇方提出確切保證後，若伊方仍向安理會申訴，則未免跡近侮辱蘇聯，常時伊總理進退兩難，乃與蘇大使作數度會商，結果撤消中訴了事。</p>
<p>據路透社紐的十六日電稱：安全理事會，將伊朗問題留入議程內後，蘇代表葛羅米柯有再度退出會塲可能。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐的十五日電〕安全理事會本晚間開會，討論伊朗事件應吾留入議程問題，伊朗及蘇聯代表要求伊朗問題除出議程，英美代表則堅決反對，雙方引起熱烈爭辯。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯甚至指英美代表對伊朗事件「越俎代庖」。</p>
<p>安全理事會本日開會時，首先決定以蘇聯與伊朗代表之函件及波蘭代表就西班牙問題之函件兩通，列入議程。旋由主席郭泰祺宜讀伊朗代表阿勒之來函，通知理事會，謂伊朗意欲撤回對蘇聯之申訴。蘇代表葛羅米柯當即起立，說明伊朗事件已由伊蘇雙方在莫斯科直接談判，安全理事會無庸再加討論。美代表斯退丁紐斯則堅持有留入議程必要程荷代表克利芬斯附和斯退丁紐斯之主張。並謂：如將此問題除出議程，則安全理事會之成信將大受影響。英代表賈德幹表示見解一致。澳洲及巴西代表附和英國見解。法代表　萊則支持條聯代表之見解，謂伊朗事件不能除出議程，未知理由何在。蘇聯代表旋再度聲明，伊朗政府旣自動要求撤回申訴，則安全理事會繼續討論此事，即無目標可言」。</p>

<h3>陳逆壁君受審　竟與檢察官反唇相譏</h3>
<p>— 本報十六日蘇州電</p>
<p>今日高院審訊陳逆　君，法庭秩序正如審判長所言：「太不成話了」！屢呼「要不得」！據院方人士表示：盛况固屬空前，秩序之壞亦爲前所未有。</p>
<p>陳逆因係女性，今日到庭旁聽之女客，較歷次審訊諸逆時爲多，約佔十分之三四。</p>
<p>汪逆之女汪文怐，衣素色旗袍，於下午零時五十分偕衣陰丹士林布旗袍之二女友，抵達法院。當入院時，記者羣均趨前詢問其感想，在女態度自然，據構：本人今日到此帝聽，準備爲記者等之目襟，且有所準備對答，惟須俟審訊完畢，始允發言。彼等悄立一旁·直至審訊完畢時，即僱車而去。汪女曾表示：明日將見報載，「汪逆之女到庭旁聽」云云。</p>
<p>陳逆於下午二時許，半馬車由看守所解到時法院。陳逆平素最不喜攝影記者拍攝照片，今日雖欲拒絕，亦不可得！</p>
<p>陳述衣藍色綢質旗袍，間有白髪，襟　自來水筆，左手帶玉鐲，右手帶手錶，身體肥胖，氣色紅潤，態度沉着，粵音國語，尖銳而淸晰，時以演說姿態演出，冀博同情，實是女界一「寳貝」！（Puppet）</p>
<p>陳逆於宣讀答辯書等，有先聲明並非希閔免罪，僅求自白。至聽衆以如何心情聽之，則概置不論。答辯書中，對檢察官公訴書各點，及用字之不當和錯誤，頗多指摘，並請求檢察官切實證明，致使審判長急於在陳逆繼續答辯時翻閱證據。</p>
<p>當陳逆答辯吿一段落時，竟有掌聲自旁聽席上而起，當經審判長予以制止，日：「此係法院，並非演說，旁聽者應有常識」！</p>
<p>陳逆自稱：「余係一個五十六歲老婦，尙有七七老母，二子，三女，二孫，本可在家抱孫，然不能置淪陷區數千萬人民於不　，冀减民衆痛苦，故忍辱負　，庶可吿慰於先總理及汪兆銘在天之靈」云云，語至最後，雜有泣音。</p>
<p>庭詢陳逆：對汪逆兆銘之和平主張是否贊成？答曰：「絕對贊成」！語氣沉重而有力。</p>
<p>嗣檢察官對陳逆之答辯有所駁斥，認陳逆受汪逆兆銘基本觀念錯誤之影響，以致頭腦不淸。陳逆反駁日：不能以成敗論英雄，如日寇不南進，中國現在將成何種局面？一若極端惋惜日本政策錯誤，而使和平運動功敗垂成者！　當陳逆反唇相議時，檢察官聲色俱厲，火氣頗大，陳逆亦尖銳刻薄，句句相逼，演成緊張形勢，審判長及時而審詢其他問題，空氣始吿緩和。</p>
<h3>褚逆民誼的嘮叨</h3>
<p>— 本報十五日蘇州電</p>
<p>駕馬車起解</p>
<p>萬衆空巷看巨奸</p>
<p>年逾花甲之褚逆民誼，於十五日午後二時，乘坐彼往日素所愛好之馬車，由看守所押解至法院，所異者昔日渠座旁常由某女運動家陪駕，牽馬車，招搖過市，供人欣賞，遭遇今日則在法警監護下，悄坐車廂一角，徒供萬人『瞻仰』囚人「風來』而已。</p>
<p>長袍紮袴脚</p>
<p>于思滿臉呈老態　　褚逆答辯時，歷二小時，語多重複，且多枝節，未能免去年老人特有之病態。變手後向，侃侃而談，猶如演說，態度故作鎭靜。今日衣細呢長袍，戴法閙西小帽子，紥褲脚，滿腮鬍子。</p>
<p>嘮叨又嚕囌</p>
<p>嗓音高亢調遲鈍</p>
<p>褚逆答辯時穿揷故事式之叙述，嘮嘮叨叨，嚕嚕囌囌，使聽者感覺莫明其妙。由於褚逆之嗓音頗高，語調遲紱，予記者聽覺上相當便利，但語多枝節，嘮叨嚕囌，使記者未能抓住中心，下筆爲難，因此也給予記者以多量之麻頃。</p>
<p>不自認元兇</p>
<p>供係十二號漢奸</p>
<p>褚逆對檢察官公訴書所稱爲叛國元兇一節，褚逆表示謙不敢當，據彼自排名次，偽外交部長應列爲第十二名漢奸，蓋上有五院院長，五院副院長，及一內政部長也。</p>
<p>傀儡政府中</p>
<p>褚逆任傀儡外長</p>
<p>褚逆供稱：彼任僞外長時，對訂立日基本條約及對英美宣戰書，均未經其本人簽字。檢察官駁斥之曰：「如情形，那是傀儡政府中的傀國外交部長！」</p>
<p>『金字招牌』</p>
<p>「被貪汚者打碎？」</p>
<p>褚逆對僞組織中之食汚官吏及仗勢敲詐的不法之徒，竟深惡痛絕，因訊彼等打碎了所謂「和平抗日」之金字招牌故也！</p>
<p>日本作賭博</p>
<p>「吃了白虎有靑龍」</p>
<p>據供稱：日寇之心目中，認中國最難對付。中國之有重慶與南京二個政府，猶奴賭錢二門，吃了白虎，還有靑龍，故對僞府絕無好感。不意日本投降太快，僞府失去對中央內應表現，這在褚逆好像是唯一的遺憾。</p>
<p>臨難裝慈悲</p>
<p>爲了小漢奸請命</p>
<p>褚逆答辯時，以待罪之身，待死這囚，爲小漢奸請命，稱：除貪污敲詐者外，其餘均爲生活所迫，因請已判刑者减刑，未被捕者免究，以爲『爲國儲才」，故對中央懲治漢奸條件，認爲不適用於現時。</p>
<p>褚逆祈早死</p>
<p>自認已老而無用</p>
<p>褚逆自在得悉繆逆斌，陳逆公博兩人判處死刑後，自知必死，曾三度請審判長判處死刑，因彼自覺雖年已六十四齡，但仍頑健，或尙有十幾年可活。如判處無期徒刑，必浪費囚糧，損失國庫，而鑒於民衆無食者衆多，實不願國家養此無用之老者。同時，渠以本人性好動，禁閉獄中，將不堪忍受。</p>
<p>滔滔地答辯</p>
<p>兩眼投向記者羣</p>
<p>褚逆滔滔答辯，或答詢時，不時以眼光投射記者羣，似恐有所記錯者。彼每事不單盡逆，且曾稱聽衆（指旁聽者）很多，不妨談談。據稱，南京淪陷後，首先「還都」謁陵者，爲褚逆本人。</p>
<p>褚逆出法院</p>
<p>黃昏鴉雀聲啁啾</p>
<p>時值黃昏，庭詢進行時，庭內鴉雀無聲，庭外則嗚聲啾啾，尋求歸宿甚急，一若爲褚逆哀鳴者。</p>
<p>七時一刻，審訊完畢。當褚逆打道回看守所時，法庭門外，觀衆之多，不亞於陳逆受審時之一幕。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>總先舉後的日本</h3>
<p>舉世屬目的日本總選舉，現已揭曉。這次總選舉之所以被世人屬目，因爲大家要看此次總選舉所反映的日本動向究屬如何。扶持一個民主的日本，是聯合國一般的意向，而日本之光吾趨向民主的大道，不難於這次總選舉測知。這次總選舉的結果是自由黨得了一百三十九議席，社會民主黨獲九十三席，進步黨護九十一席，合作黨十六席，共產黨五席，無黨派者八十四席。自由黨的前身是政友會，進步黨的前身是民政黨。提起政友會，這在中國人民的印象自然最爲深刻。田中奏摺的作者是以政友會的總裁而組織田中內閣的；犬養毅也是以政友會的總裁而出來組閣。這在中國人民的心理上是與日本的軍閥及侵略主義結着很深的不解緣的。這次總選舉的結果，獲議席最多的却就是政友會化身的自由黨。此後日本政治將如何演變，因此也頗堪注意。無論幣原內閣繼續變棧也好，自由黨首領鶂山出來與各黨組織聯合內閣也好，這次總選舉的結果總已指出一種趨向，即使日本的保守養依然很濃，民主化的努力還提扶持。</p>
<p>本來，在中國人民的心中，對這次日本的總選舉並不寄予若何重視期待。日本人民受軍閥統治歷時旣久，要走向民主的大道，決不是一蹴可就。自由黨爲政友人的化身，利用政友會在原有的組織與聲勢，在這次競選中獲票最多，乃是意料中的事。不過因爲這次總選舉的結果，日本民主化的可能究克有多少，却値得我們探究。據近日的報載消息，出現在日本的近事兩則，頗値得我們的注意。（一）據聯合社東京一日電：日本南部櫻島火山，噴射灰烟石塊已廿二天，岩液鼎沸，闣半哩，長達二哩牛，隨坡續向小村黑神流去，每小時三四呎，不久將流人鹿兒島灣，或可凝成狹道，連接櫻島與九州本部。一般老村民以爲日本戰敗，觸怒天神，故而火山爆發。據稱，日皇之弟近赴鹿兒島後面山中神社，向天神禀吿日本已敗北，未幾，火山即爆發。（二）路透社東京六日電：東京迤西十五哩處之。Chofu飛行塲，發生日人對盟軍所施第一次有組織之破壞行動，該處美第五航空隊全體人員，均奉令作廿四小時之武裝戒備，日暴從於昏暗中潛入機塲，破壞價値鉅大之交通及飛機設備，切斷電話電報綫，搗毀電報機器。就破壞之情形觀，似係具有專門技能之人所爲，故料破壞分子或係日本軍人。</p>
<p>上面丙件事實告訴我們，日本人民的頒固思想，並不因這次戰敗而有所更改。日本戰敗，而日人却認爲觸怒天神，察其語意，一若日本是不應該戰敗的，所以天神要怒，要噴火；假若日本戰勝，天神就不怒，不噴火了！如果這種思想仍舊存在日本人心中，則日本人定必依舊在做「八纮一宇」的迷夢！他們夢寐中或仍以爲這次戰敗不過是暫時的，天神必將保佑日本人民不但恢復他們固有的光榮，且將統治「八紱」。從這件小事看，可知日本的侵略思想如何根深蒂固，日本人需要再敎育是如何迫切。至於破壞盟軍飛機塲，旣係有組織的行動，且係具有專門技能的日人所爲，可知日本人民在日本爲盟軍占領之下，尙不恍然於戰敗之因果，仍復蠶然思動。由於前一件事實，我們可知侵略思想在日本民問如何普遍深入，有待澄淸，由於後一件事實，可知日本人民隨時準備採取報復行動。凡此，均應使參加管制日本的盟邦，於決定管制日本政策時，必須考慮燭詳。</p>
<p>此次日本總選舉的結果，與前兩宗事實拼在一起加以觀察，可知日本人民對戰敗的澈底覺悟，爲時尙早。民主的日本，還須經過一條漫長的道路。因此，盟軍共同佔領日本應更經歷一個較長的時期；而且對於管制日本的方式和方法也似乎應加調整和强化。在波茨坦，盟國決定利用日本的原有機構來統治日本。日本要求保留天皇制度，但盟國的回答是，天皇須受盟軍晨高統帥的節制，可知日本是無條件投降，整個制度和機構的存廢權操在盟軍統帥之手。由於最近出現在日本的事態，特別是政友會化身的自由黨在總選舉中獲勝，日本侵略思想的潛伏性很濃，利用日本原有機構來統治日本這個決定，是否可以稱爲明智，也頗値得考慮。</p>
<p>總選舉後的日本，依舊是換湯不換藥的日本；不過由政友會的日本，謂爲自由黨的日本。侵略主義神權思想的肅淸，還需要一個很畏的時期。日本的民主化，要期諸日本人的自發，現在似乎還沒有到時候。盟軍統治日本和日本的再敎育，此後必須加緊，一直要到殘餘的日本傳統思想亦即日本的侵略思想完全肅淸了，日本纔能眞正走上民主化的大道。</p>

<h3>多言陣脚不穩　金價繼續向下　結款較少美鈔亦路跌</h3>
<p>烚赤自經前日中行予打擊者以打擊，漲後回降，昨市顯見浮多了結，午前曾破一五大關，而後稍平，查　開平盤，開後情况穩健，在一五四萬左右掙扎較久，中行配售價依然，市價低，無人要，但此後多方陣容零落，陸續將前數日進貨出籠，漸漸下降，一部份到本多頭發生恐慌，午前曾破一五大關，退至一四九萬而後稍形平穩，午後形勢更定，在一五二萬左右盤旋，結果較前收續跌三萬，銀樓飾金十六萬六，紋銀一千五，銀元亦平，暗拆以銀根仍鬆，息價目一角二分至一角半，外行則約一角六至三角。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔買風暫止，出籠遂多，初時在二〇五〇元光景徘徊，迨金價回落，美鈔亦略起斬殺，結款較少，昨形供過於求，午前曾破二千元關，午刻稍見回上，午後在二〇二〇元左右徘徊，結果較前收續跌二十元，對黃金套價約七五〇元對十兩，港票平庸，結果老貨微挫，新貨則平，美匯羅比港電均平，不合格之進口貨均轉購美鈔抵補。</p>
<p>債市儘量管狹窄　高價層出不窮</p>
<p>公債昨續遭業中大戶作弄，北帮游資歸來、晨開種即穿出五千元大關，自五〇五〇元左右，逐步拉高至五三五〇元新高峯，而後稍盤，午刻在五二五〇元光景徘徊，警局巡查證交大樓老巢，中途時起風浪，但以債市愈做愈黑，潮不普遍，午收尙穩，結果較前收再漲三百元，此外甲乙丁稍昇，戊種微挫。</p>
<h3>股票漸疲</h3>
<p>華股高價仍難持久，堅後稍疲，籌碼雖涸，無如業中人心反向，多頭有利即取，以致好景不常，永紗自中途五四〇〇元，美亞四五〇〇元，景福四五〇元高價，逐漸小落，冷門各股則一致趨穩，居於次熱地位之新光勤興，有人套買，市價步挺，各元老股止資轉買，形勢亦漸呈穩健，午刻熱門以低價結束，冷門則呈高價，背道而她，差價軋攏，結果較前收計永紗景福微升，美亞漲半成，新光勤興則升一成左右，冷門及元老則均呈穩健，午後期交永紗美亞量福喊價稍高，新光勤興則略低，外股昨有廣帮某信託公司獲利了結，傾售怡紗不少，以致漲勢亦難支持，晨開浮多仍有活動，怡紗見一四二〇〇元高價，迨漲後轉盤，多方心理聽於不進則退，陣容動搖，急切回跌，怡紗曾跌至一三關邊，而後轉定，午收較前收計紙業亞洲跌一成，餘跌半成左右。</p>
<h3>紗花價徵漲</h3>

<p>〔聯合社英國溫勃邱登十五日電〕惠勃爾登國際草地綱球錦標賽，將於今夏復活。球塲雖尙留有德機炸彈之創痕，但草地已碧綠可愛。據全英網球總會某幹事稱：惠勃爾登此賽停頓七載，一旦恢復，聞訊之下，興味無窮。大戰期間，塲址中彈一枚，中央球塲周圍看台一萬座位中，被毀一千二百座。英國現正忙於修葺被毀住宅，無暇顧及運動塲，故塲上損毀部份，本屆比賽時，恐未能修復。全英網球總會以交通困難，本屆擬取消資格賽，僅由比賽委員會挑出選手，參加六月廿四日至七月六日之比賽，比賽項目爲男子及女子單打雙打，及男女混合雙打，選手名單將於五月下旬公布。據網球總會秘書麥考萊稱：「全世界各國紛紛來函詢問比賽事宜，網球比賽在歐洲大陸受兵燹各國間已迅速恢復以前盛况，人人幾全有奪標之雄心。中國亦將參加比賽，南美洲各國已表示熱烈興趣，美國當照舊派遣有力隊伍參加，英國選手將較年靑，缺乏練習，且大抵未遇勁敵云。</p>

<h3>浪子回頭</h3>
<p>— 雪華</p>
<p>二年以前，我寫了一個故事，開頭是光明，結束是黑暗，於是許多朋友向我說：「你顛倒了！應該開頭黑暗，結束光明，才是道理。」</p>
<p>在某一時期，浪子回頭的故事，的確似乎成了定型。不論翻開什麽文藝雜誌，不論是長篇短篇，幾乎千篇一律，總是有一個沉淪於黑暗中的浪子，荒唐，墮落，吃到極大的苦頭，最后覺悟了，回　頭來，踏上一條光明大道。</p>
<p>淪在黑暗中的浪子不應該回頭嗎？當然絕對不！人旣然從情慾所生，當然免不了情慾的誘惑，免不了要失足墮落，祇要不墮落到底，祇要肯回頭，「回頭是岸」，未嘗不能重獲光明，所以浪子回頭的故事是有意義的，牠咒詛黑暗，頌揚光明。</p>
<p>不過，我常常覺得，人是好奇的動物，尤其是一班年輕的青年人，當他們捧着一篇浪子回頭的故事，津津有味地讀着時，恐怕　次那最後的光明收梢，屬於少數，而神往於那浪子沉淪墮落時的一剎那狂歡沉醉，倒屬於多數吧？</p>
<p>青年們又是最最大胆的，地獄雖然可怕，若有人告訴他進了地獄仍可出來，他也許會說：「那不妨跳下去玩玩！」</p>
<p>我並不反對浪子回頭的故事，但有時我免不掉有些疑懼：因着浪子的可以回頭，會不會造成更多的浪子呢？</p>
<h3>死靈魂</h3>
<p>— 黃文錦</p>
<p>他把破碎的窗幔輕悄地放下，捻亮暗藍的桌燈，一縷淡淡的光芒投照在鏡框上，他對一年前的像影微笑了一下，記得那身筆挺的夜服是她伴他去定做的，雪白的襯衫上還遺留着她的朱唇印</p>
<p>水仙的枯瓣懸到桌上，停留在火車票的旁邊，他嘆息了，揀起這衰萎的片兒跟票子一齊夾入皮包裏。</p>
<p>拉開衣櫥，空洞地沒有一件了，那些華貴的衣衫這時候正在舊貨商店的窗子裏招展吧。突然，在角落間翻出一件東西——頂遭人咒詛的黑帽子！他不自覺地俯首沉默了。</p>
<p>他有些羞慚，依稀心田上已經種植了一株毀不掉的罪惡樹，那黑色的枝葉呵，茁長着多少卑劣的事蹟。</p>
<p>黑帽子，誰會忘記這些抗戰時期的敗類。</p>
<p>他忽然憶起了自己，這是許多年來麻木的死靈魂，如一雙毒爛的鞋子永遠不能踐在光明的大路上了那些紙醉金迷的日子呵……</p>
<p>他惋惜地昂起頭來，好的時光可惜不能倒流了，許多美妙的倩影依次呈現眼前，被他所蹂躪的呻吟聲又在耳邊動蕩起來，這是媚人的從的笑聲啊，那眩耀的眸子，鑽石，珍寶，金錢像湖水般涌進他的黑帽子裏。</p>
<p>「只要你愛我，我是永遠愛你的……」</p>
<p>可是如今誰也不理睬他了，摩天廳上依然燈碧輝煌，風雨侵蝕下，他的美夢破碎了，是那般容易地，從踏上了吉普車……</p>
<p>他被汽笛聲從迷茫中清醒過來，什麽都不是他的，現在是他走出這都市的時候了，帶着他僅有的——死靈魂。</p>
<h3>音樂小談</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>有一個黃昏，因着種種原因，我心頭懊惱萬分，躺在床上苦思焦慮，總難成眠，正當那時，突然隔壁傳來一串銅琴之聲，先是低緩柔弱，繼則忽緩忽強，漸漸地　起來，快起來，驀地「鏘」的一聲，刹那之間，如萬馬奔騰，萬鼓齊鳴！到這時候，我不由得把什麽痛苦懊惱都忘掉了，祇覺得自己的一顆心，已跟着那雄壯的錚錚錝錝之聲，飛到了天空的高處，一切紛紜的世事，都離開我遠了，遠了！……</p>
<p>「音樂是天國的鑰匙！」近幾年中，與一位擅長音樂的朋友為鄰後，我常常有一種說不出所以然的經驗和感覺，也常常這樣向朋友們說。</p>
<p>對於音樂的種種花樣，我不懂得，暫且不談，只談幾點關於音樂的小建議：</p>
<p>第一，我覺得一個病人臨終之時，與其在他床前大哭小喊，還不如在他床邊奏一隻幽靜的曲子。</p>
<p>第二，我想不妨由國家鼓勵，叫人去發明一種新式的算盤，要每一顆算盤珠撥動時，能發出一陣美妙音樂。</p>
<p>第三，許多大官大員，在什麽會什麽會中，爭得面紅耳赤的時候，最好由主持人宣佈停止發言，而立即換以各種愉快悅耳的音樂，待大家額上紅筋退盡，再繼續開會。</p>
<h3>古老的一天</h3>
<p>連綿了幾千百年，永遠廢除不了的一天，街上的行人，十九都帶着朦朧的睡眼，像潮水樣滿街子擠呀擠的，都顯得挺夠刺激，挺夠快活，尤其在苦悶了八年的上海，在這古老的習俗重又到臨時，大家都很興奮。</p>
<p>過去多少創痛，幾許舊恨新仇，暫時都被拋棄了。在「保吾海隅」的石　下，擠進了闊別了八年的邑廟，沉香的氣氛，迷惑住多少男女的心靈，他們各各懷着不同的宏願，在菩薩前，默默地陳訴着。城隅伸着手，無聲無息地——接受。這心靈的陳訴，不願公諸世人面前的隱秘，但願菩薩感應宏大，賜償他們的夙願吧。</p>
<p>九曲橋別來無恙？斷欄處處，劫餘的創痛，豈能掩飾？橋下綠衣攸攸，再也引不起游子們憑欄觀望的趣味了。咦！邑廟前的刦場，在城隍面前，也不知已經捐棄了多少寶貴的性靈呢？</p>
<p>步上松月樓，——古老的素食館，重嘗一年一度的素食，別有一番韻味。飯罷倚窗閒眺，而街上熙熙攘攘，誰信這兒是經過八年滄桑變幻的境地呢？望着「內閱」緊合着的大門，不知裏邊也是這樣逗人興感不！要不是暖和的陽光，映在一縷縷香烟上，疊成一層層不可捉摸的彩影，真不知今天是什麽日子了，這古老的一天！</p>
<h3>過秦樓　巴山北泉數帆晚　坐黃鐘商依夢窗</h3>

<p>獨浪縈回，冷空灰暗，萬翠障紗籠霧，漣開綠篠，石墜紅興，雲氣一　吞吐，燕子歸來窺簾，輕語磋商，依依簷撫，問經年客裏，旗亭懸想，伊人何處。　漫憶起萬滴啼痕，絲絲紅玉，都入無邊　樹，炊湯散熱，榕樹凝根，恰似舊情支柱，生怕憑欄暗設，江上來船，斜暉延竚，看東流逝水，飄得孤帆遠去。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（二七）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>「可是，老爺！這么多年您都相安無事地過去了，如今怎麼又忽然認真起來了呢？唉！都是喝酒不好！您大概還醉着吧！」墨盛的語氣裏含着些抱怨。因為他怕趕明兒墨太太報復起來，還是墨老爺受罪，他知道墨太太是不會輕饒墨老爺的。</p>
<p>墨老爺搖搖頭，嘆了一口氣說：</p>
<p>「我也是忍無可忍了！」</p>
<p>接着一陣劇烈的咳嗽，使墨老爺幾乎喘不過氣來。墨盛喂了他些水，還是沒用。而且墨老爺開始嚷着肺腔痛，要墨盛替他按摩。於是墨盛發現墨老爺的體溫高得可怕！他不禁驚叫着：</p>
<p>「怎麼？老爺，您在發熱呀！」</p>
<p>墨老爺沒注意墨盛的話，只覺得胸膜震動得像要爆炸似的！他用自己的手搥打着。而且逐漸感到氣塞神凝，彷徘一座山倒下來，壓在了他的身上，他被捲進了一個陰森的深淵！</p>
<p>「老爺！老爺！您，您怎麼啦？」</p>
<p>墨盛邊喊，邊扶起墨老爺來，用手指使勁兒捏着他的文中。（鼻頭的下端。）這樣約摸有一刻鐘工夫，墨老爺才又甦醒過來，慢慢恢復了輕微的呼吸。</p>
<p>墨老爺已經病了！</p>
<p>這時上房墨太太還在哭罵着。墨盛傾聽這兩交响的啼聲和呻吟，他不知如何是好？在平常，他也許可以去請示墨太太，替墨老爺找個大夫來，或則是討點人參給墨老爺熬點湯喝。可是如今他不敢，也不能！墨太太正生氣，他若去告訴了墨太太，墨太太一定不肯理喻，怎麼辦呢？簡直束手無策！只有陪伴着墨老爺，憂慮地度過這熬煎的一夜再說。</p>
<p>墨老爺後來便迷惑地睡着了。</p>
<p>第二天，墨老爺的病依然不見輕，而且咳嗽的時候，痰非常多。這現象，使墨盛感到莫大的憂懼。他曾鼓着勇氣去告訴墨太太，果不出所料，墨太太不睬他。墨盛輾轉愁思，最後只有自己作主，替墨老爺請了個大夫來。診視的結果，大夫說墨老爺是肺癆症，需要補肺健胃，經過長期的休養，不操勞不生氣，才能夠漸漸痊愈起來。</p>
<p>這無異是宣佈了墨老爺的死刑，他不可能有充分優良的醫藥治療，墨太太為了懷恨墨老爺，一文錢不肯拿出來，全靠墨盛，是沒辦法的。至於休養，更談不到，墨老爺生活的環境，便是一個生氣的環境。因此，看來墨老爺的病是很少有希望好了。</p>
<p>寶鈴和麗華不斷輪流地侍候墨老爺，但是只要給墨太太看見了，就免不了一頓責駡，為了這，孩子們和墨盛都苦惱很！</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles for Two Days on the Outskirts of Changchun; Some Communist Troops Invade the City; Nationalist Troops in Sipingjie Continue Northward Advance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] According to a telegram from Chen Jiazhen, Commander of the Changchun Security Regiment: Soviet troops completely withdrew from Changchun at 11:30 AM on the 14th. From 12:00 PM, Communist troops began attacking the outskirts. At 1:00 AM on the 15th, the airport was occupied by Communist troops. The siege of the city became extremely fierce. At 6:00 AM on the 16th, some Communist troops had already invaded the city. Furthermore, the telegram bureau here heard communications from the Changchun telegram bureau to Jinzhou and Chongqing, reporting a critical situation. After 3:00 PM, no further signals were received from Changchun, suggesting that the city's power supply had been cut off and the situation was unclear. Also, telephone communication between Changchun and Harbin has been cut off.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] According to information received by relevant parties here: Changchun city has been bombarded by Communist troops, resulting in numerous casualties. Chen Jiazhen, the commander of the Changchun city defense, is leading his troops in stubbornly defending the isolated city, fighting against overwhelming odds. The battle is extremely fierce.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] Reports from Beiping and Shenyang today indicate that Communist troops have occupied three airfields outside Changchun and are rushing into this key northeastern city from multiple directions, forcing 7,000 Nationalist troops to retreat towards the Manzhou Coal Mining Building area.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shenyang, 16th] The Northeast Security Headquarters announced that the main force of the New First Army, equipped with American weaponry, entered Sipingjie at 10:00 AM this morning and will continue to advance towards Changchun to rescue the Changchun garrison. A neutral aircraft is currently planned to be dispatched to Changchun to rescue five male and one female American journalists.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 16th] A military spokesman for the National Government stated that the Nationalist troops in Changchun are greatly outnumbered and are still resisting the Communist siege. The Nationalist force consists of only a few thousand men, mostly from the New Sixth Army, with a small number of security forces. Tonight, news circulated here that the aircraft originally allocated for transporting officials back to the capital may be reassigned to transport special troops to Changchun, but this has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 15th] The Communist troops at the three stations on the Linyu-Jinzhou railway line - Qian Suo, Wanjia Tun, and Gao Ling - have been driven back on the 15th. Track repair is currently underway, and traffic is expected to resume on the 32nd.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] Guo Taiqi, the Chinese representative to the United Nations, stated yesterday that the Chinese government has no intention of submitting the Northeast conflict to the Security Council for discussion, but hopes that the fighting will cease immediately after the arrival of mediation representatives in the Northeast and the return of Special Envoy Marshall to China.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu High Court Is Packed; People Vie to See the Number One Female Traitor; Chen Bijun Proclaims in Court Her Willingness to Die</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Suzhou, 16th] The Jiangsu High Court tried Chen Bijun yesterday at 2:25 PM. The audience was so large that even the defendant's seat was occupied. When Presiding Judge Sun Honglin, Chief Judge Shi Meiyu, Judge Lu Jiarui, Prosecutor Wei Weiqing, and Clerk Qin Daoli took their seats, the entire courtroom was packed. Even the bailiffs had barely any room to stand. After the court opened, Chen Bijun, escorted by bailiffs and military police, squeezed through the crowd. She was wearing a blue cloth cheongsam and appeared quite excited, with a rosy complexion and a loud voice, not at all like someone who had been ill for a long time. After the presiding judge asked about her age and place of origin, the prosecutor stood up and announced the prosecution's charges. Chen Bijun responded in court, holding a prepared defense statement, speaking at length, seemingly wanting to exploit the audience's sympathy and use her eloquent tongue to achieve her cunning goal. At one point, some ignorant members of the audience even applauded, which was stopped by the court. The presiding judge then asked a series of questions, showed her the evidence, and allowed Chen Bijun to read it freely. At 3:50 PM, he announced that the investigation of evidence was complete. The prosecutor rose to make his argument, and Chen Bijun added her own defense, appearing even more eloquent. The atmosphere became extremely tense, and order in the court became increasingly chaotic. Then, the public defender, Gao Rong, gave a customary defense. At 4:35 PM, the presiding judge announced the end of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 3:00 PM on the 22nd of this month, the same time as Chu Minyi's sentencing. He then adjourned the court. As the audience rushed out of the court, a senior official of the High Court told reporters: "Today's disorder has set a new record since the establishment of the High Court."</p>
<h3>Disorder in the High Court; Chen Bijun Acts Like an Orator; Prosecutor Wei Lists Four Major Crimes</h3>
<p>Chen Bijun was escorted to the court from the detention center in a horse-drawn carriage at 2:20 PM under heavy guard by military police. Her daughter and daughter-in-law arrived in the audience around 1:00 PM but quickly left because they were surrounded by reporters, only to return after the trial began. After the court opened, President Sun instructed the military police assisting in maintaining order to withdraw, as weapons were not allowed in the court. However, this made the order even more chaotic. Chen Bijun arrived in court with a slight smile, appearing very happy, like an orator. When the court asked about her age and place of origin, she stated: 56 years old, from Xinhui, Guangdong, residing at 30 Fazheng Road, Guangzhou. She had been a supervisory committee member of the Central Party Headquarters since 1924, "until now." She has two sons, three daughters, and three grandchildren. When the court asked about her assets, she replied in a rather disrespectful tone: "They have all been confiscated by the government. They should know better than I do." She then stated that she has a house at 30 Fazheng Road in Guangzhou, a house at 570 Fuli Road in Shanghai, and farmland in Guangdong, but she could not remember the acreage. The house at 18 Xikang Road in Nanjing "was a gift from comrades, but I never lived in it." She also has stocks, but she could not remember the exact amount.</p>
<p>At this time, Prosecutor Wei stood up and stated that the defendant is the wife of the traitor Wang Zhaoming, and had served as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee. During the Sino-Japanese War, she colluded with the Japanese chieftain Konoe to secretly negotiate peace and then secretly left Chongqing, betraying the Central Government. She used secret telegrams with the code names "Ming" (referring to Wang Zhaoming) and "Cliff" (referring to the defendant) to co-govern with Wang, wielding great power. After Wang's death, she continued to travel around for the puppet organization and secretly established intelligence agencies to harm Central Government personnel. He then cited four specific events: (A) The puppet Guangdong provincial military and political affairs were all decided by the defendant, with the intention of cutting off the government's supply of materials and weakening the strength of the resistance. (B) She recruited bandits and reorganized Li Qun's former Fourth Route Army, appointing many puppet officials, showing her desire to help those with the same evil intentions. This occurred after the puppet Guangdong Governor Chen Chunpu left office, four months before Chu Minyi took office in Guangdong. (C) The intelligence from the puppet Central Executive Committee's intelligence leaders Liao Gongshao, Chen Gengting, and Jian Shu was all reported to the defendant for review, showing her control of the intelligence work in South China. (D) In personnel administration and administration, she only followed the orders of the enemy, requiring the consent of the "liaison officer Yazaki and the military commander Sakai," showing her collusion with the enemy and resistance to our country. The defendant has committed the crime stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors, and should be tried according to law.</p>
<p>Chen Bijun Speaks Wildly in Her Defense</p>
<p>After the prosecutor returned to his seat, the court ordered Chen Bijun to defend herself. Chen Bijun knew that this was her last chance to gain public sympathy in her life, so she held a pencil, pointed in all directions, and spoke wildly, stating: (A) Her return to Guangdong was to carry out a mission, and going to Nanjing was to visit her elderly mother and grandchildren. Traveling between Nanjing and Guangdong cannot be arbitrarily concluded as intentional: two months in Nanjing, two months in Guangdong, with ulterior motives. (B) After Chen Chunpu left office, she independently managed Guangdong's affairs and invited Chu Minyi to Guangdong, which was not inappropriate. She was in Guangdong after Wang Zhaoming's death. At that time, there were widespread rumors that the American army was about to land, the security situation was volatile, and the Communist army took the opportunity to make trouble. After the governor resigned, many department heads also resigned. She believed that if she did not resolutely take office, the spread of the Communist army and the suffering of the people would be unimaginable. The 30 million people of Guangdong could not be abandoned, so she risked returning to Guangdong, arriving on March 12th. She presided over affairs until Chu Minyi took office in April. At this time, there was a shortage of food, and the price of rice in Guangdong reached a peak of 122,000 yuan per dan in legal tender. She negotiated with the Japanese after discussing with the heads of the civil and financial departments, and after great hardship, the Japanese agreed to open waterways and stop collecting military rice and stop collecting rice from the people. The price of rice plummeted to 52,000-53,000 yuan per dan. "This is the achievement of the civil and military comrades in Guangdong, which can be reported to the Premier above and to Mr. Wang below." As for the claim that Chen Yaozu reported everything to her when he was governor, it was because they lived in the same house, so what if they helped each other? (C) Regarding intelligence: (1) Who was the intelligence sent to? She was a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, and Chen Yaozu was a member of the Central Executive Committee. She cannot be responsible for telegrams addressed to the Central Executive Committee. (2) "If people send me things to read, am I responsible for the content? Whether I am related to the intelligence is one thing, and being in charge of the intelligence agency is another. If I am indeed responsible, I am willing to die, why would I deny it?" (D) They have at least achieved rationing by headcount, so that the people have food to eat. The hardship of negotiating with the Japanese for these matters, some of their affairs did require the consent of the Japanese side because Guangdong was a place occupied by Japanese military force. They are working hard to seek welfare for the people and cannot be called resistance to our country. If the government considers such achievements of rescuing the people as resistance to our country, she is willing to be sentenced to death (at this point, someone applauded, but was stopped by the court).</p>
<p>She even defended Wang, praising him highly, and said that she was still "working hard" after Wang's death because the "Sixth Plenary Session" declaration stated "worthy of the martyrs, worthy of the descendants, sharing life and death... to violate the purpose of jointly building the country," so she dared not stay at home in peace. She is unwilling to appeal, unwilling to defend herself, and willing to die calmly, but she also asks the court to leniently punish other collaborators.</p>
<p>The Court Announces the Investigation Is Completed</p>
<p>The court then began to question: The most important point of your defense is that the intelligence reports found were addressed to Chen Yaozu, not you? (Answer) I dare not say none of them. If it is addressed to Chen of the Central Supervisory Committee, then it is mine. (Question) Have you seen these intelligence reports? (Answer) Not now, I need to see them. (Question) Were you involved in the recruitment of the puppet army Zhang Yizhou and the former Fourth Army Li Qun? (Answer) I was not involved, but I did see Chen Yaozu's report. (Question) The secret telegram code names "Ming," "Cliff," and "Hua," "Ming" is Wang, "Cliff" is you? (Answer) According to the tone of the telegram, Wang is "Ming," and "Cliff," apart from me, there is no one. "Hua" can only be Chen Yaozu. (Question) Did all matters, large and small, in Guangdong province have to be discussed with the Japanese at that time? (Answer) Major matters yes, minor matters no. Major matters such as troop movements, passing through Japanese military zones, etc. (Question) Did the appointment of civil and military officials require the consent of Shizaki and Sakai? (Answer) Not consent, but notification. Do not forget that this is a Japanese-occupied area with 300,000 to 400,000 Japanese soldiers. (Question) Wang went from Chongqing to Vietnam, then to Shanghai, then to Japan, to contact the Japanese and sign the agreement. Were you always involved? (Answer) I knew about it, but it involved diplomacy and I did not participate. My task was to do things for the people. (Question) Did you agree with Wang's proposal? (Answer) Absolutely agreed. When making this answer, her tone was firm and powerful. (Question) Wang agreed when the decision was made in Nanjing to resist Japan? (Answer) Yes, because at that time it was believed that war was inevitable. (Question) When did you change your mind? (Answer) At the end of 1937, when the German ambassador Trautmann mediated the Sino-Japanese War. (Question) Why did you go to Chongqing later? (Answer) Wang advocated that the entire government become one. (Question) Since you agreed with peace, why not make suggestions to the central government and go to Hanoi first? (Answer) We made suggestions countless times, and we wanted to leave six times, but we always couldn't bear to leave. We only managed to leave on the sixth attempt. (Question) Since the majority of the central government officials advocated war, how could one or two people make a peace movement? (Answer) Normal legal procedures can be used when the country is normal, but not when it is in crisis. Moreover, one person's opinion is not the opinion of the whole country. After Wang left, he kept in contact with Chongqing by telegram until Zeng Zhongming was killed, and then the telegram contact was cut off. (Question) Did you have correspondence with Xu Chongzhi? (Answer) I once advised him to go to Nanjing or Shanghai to live, not to live in Hong Kong. (Question) On February 8, 1942, did you give a speech at the Greater Asia Conference in Guangdong? (Answer) Yes, the court then read out the original text, which included "National affairs have been misled by Chiang Kai-shek's reliance on Britain and the United States, leading to this point," (Answer) Yes. (Question) Did you advocate that we should not contact Britain and the United States, but should contact Japan? (Answer) This is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. If Japan had not attacked Pearl Harbor that year and had advanced north, would Britain and the United States have helped us as they do today? At this time, the court presented many pieces of evidence for review. (Question) Have you been to Japan? (Answer) I went there when I was seventeen. After that, I only went to see him when Wang was ill on March 3, 1944. Thereupon the court announced the investigation of evidence was completed, at 3:50 PM.</p>
<p>A Fierce Debate with the Prosecutor</p>
<p>Prosecutor Wei then stood up and argued that Wang was admired by the defendant, but Wang's basic ideas were wrong and his knowledge was useless. Yang Xiong and Qin Hui were both knowledgeable, but their character was extremely low. Her words and deeds all violated the central government and were ignorant of the world situation. The defendant did serve as a member of the Central Executive Committee and the Central Political Committee after the fall of the government, and there is party card evidence to check. Moreover, why shouldn't intelligence agents kill people? Saying that she didn't read the intelligence is just an excuse. As for the high prices in Guangdong province, the defendant and others maintained the ground, which was not wrong, but the merit cannot offset the demerit.</p>
<p>When Chen Bijun responded, her expression was extremely excited. She claimed: "I only understood two out of ten sentences of the prosecutor's words." She said: "Everyone knows whether Wang's words and deeds are good or bad. Saying 'the words are good but the deeds are not good,' 'there is no follow-up to saying this'." Heroes cannot be judged by success or failure, and they cannot be falsely accused just because they are dead. Whether her actions were beneficial to the country can be publicly asked of the people. She also said: "I have never been a member of the Central Executive Committee. The prosecutor insists that I admit it. I can only ask to go to the party headquarters to check. Documents can be moved. Provincial officials can certainly take them home to read, so why do you insist that it was given to me just because it was found in my house? In terms of administration, Japanese approval and consent are two different things. We cannot do things that the Japanese do not agree to, there is nothing to lose face. The area was not lost by us! As for the intelligence, first of all, it was not given to me at all, and even if it was given to me, it cannot be said that the intelligence was organized by me." The prosecutor was often very angry and stood up to question: "You say you don't understand, but you do! Do you understand Yang Xiong and Qin Hui? They were both knowledgeable, Qin Hui was the top scholar!" Chen also said angrily: "This is a court, so I won't say impolite words. A top scholar can only write essays and make articles, is that considered knowledgeable?" The prosecutor said: "He was very knowledgeable." Chen said: "You have to look at a person's views, because someone lost the battle, and we went to rescue the orphaned and helpless people." The atmosphere was extremely tense. The court then asked: "When the decision to resist Japan was made, you said Wang agreed. Resistance requires sacrifice, it requires a price." Chen replied: "We only fight when we have to fight, and we only sacrifice when we have to sacrifice." Asked: "The basic treaty stipulates the stationing of troops in Mongolia and North China, and the Sino-Japanese-Manchu declaration was issued. Is the Northeast not wanted?" Answer; "Of course not, the 'words' on the treaty can be eliminated, as long as everyone works hard. In fact, we wanted to make Manchukuo surrender, but we didn't succeed."</p>
<h3>One Court Debate, Sentencing on the 22nd</h3>
<p>Then, the public defender Gao Rong stood up to make a defense, saying: The Japanese were so tyrannical, it is excusable that the defendants could barely maintain security, etc. The court then announced the end of the debate, scheduled sentencing for 3:00 PM on the 22nd, and adjourned. Chen Bijun was still taken back by horse-drawn carriage. (Please refer to the second page for more news about the trial of Chen and Chu).</p>

<h3>Awaiting Report from Special Committee, Security Council Decides to Postpone Discussion on Iranian Issue, U.S. Representative Firmly Requests Keeping It on the Agenda</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] San Francisco, 16th Broadcast: The Security Council has decided to postpone discussions on the Iranian issue, pending receipt of a report from the committee of experts, after which discussions will resume. The experts committee's report is expected to be submitted within two days.</p>
<p>Following today's Security Council meeting, French representative Bonneau suggested requesting the United Nations Acting Secretary-General Lie to collect various intelligence reports on the Iranian issue to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. Lie immediately presented a lengthy report discussing the legal points regarding whether the Security Council could keep the Iranian issue on the agenda. As a result, the matter was submitted to a committee of experts for review, with a deadline of two days to return it to the Security Council along with their comments. U.S. Representative Stettinius requested that the Iranian issue remain on the agenda, stating that this approach would neither infringe upon Iranian sovereignty nor interfere with the content of the Soviet-Iranian agreement.</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources, Iran's announcement of the withdrawal of its complaint was, in reality, a last resort. Last weekend, the Soviet ambassador visited the Iranian prime minister three times, unequivocally stating that Soviet troops would certainly withdraw from Iran by May 6th. The Iranian prime minister, believing that the Soviet side had provided a firm guarantee, felt that continuing to lodge a complaint with the Security Council would be close to insulting the Soviet Union. The Iranian prime minister was in a difficult position and consulted with the Soviet ambassador several times, resulting in the cancellation of the complaint.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 16th, Soviet Representative Gromyko might withdraw from the meeting again if the Security Council keeps the Iranian issue on the agenda.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 15th] The Security Council met this evening to discuss whether to keep the Iranian issue on the agenda. Representatives from Iran and the Soviet Union requested the removal of the Iranian issue from the agenda, while representatives from Britain and the United States firmly opposed this, leading to heated debate. Soviet Representative Gromyko even accused the British and American representatives of "meddling" in the Iranian issue.</p>
<p>During today's Security Council meeting, it was first decided to add to the agenda the letters from the Soviet and Iranian representatives, as well as a letter from the Polish representative regarding the Spanish issue. Subsequently, Chairman Guo Taiqi read aloud a letter from Iranian representative Ardelan, informing the Council that Iran intended to withdraw its complaint against the Soviet Union. Soviet Representative Gromyko immediately rose to explain that the Iranian issue had been directly negotiated between Iran and the Soviet Union in Moscow, and the Security Council need not discuss it further. U.S. Representative Stettinius insisted that it was necessary to keep the issue on the agenda. Norwegian Representative Lieffer agreed with Stettinius's proposal, stating that removing this issue from the agenda would greatly affect the credibility of the Security Council. British Representative Cadogan expressed the same view. Representatives from Australia and Brazil echoed the British view. French Representative Parreau supported the view of the Norwegian representative, saying that he did not know why the Iranian issue could not be removed from the agenda. The Soviet representative then stated again, "Since the Iranian government has voluntarily requested the withdrawal of its complaint, there is no point in the Security Council continuing to discuss this matter."</p>
<h3>French Troops Reinforce Western Border; Spain Accuses France and the Soviet Union of Having a Secret Agreement, Invites Countries to Investigate the Truth in Spain</h3>
<p>[United Press, Franco-Spanish Border, 15th] The Franco-Spanish border now has two lines of defense with French border guards and several security teams reinforced, making it difficult for Spaniards who illegally cross the border to sneak into France. The area along the eastern Pyrenees province, which stretches for 200 miles under the snow-covered Pyrenees Mountains, is under especially strict surveillance. [United Press, Tokyo, 16th] The Spanish government today issued formal invitations to countries that maintain "friendly relations" with Spain, inviting them to send a committee of experts to investigate whether German scientists are researching atomic bombs in Spain, as claimed by Poland. The invitation was issued through the British ambassador. The Soviet Union may not be on the list of invitees, as it does not maintain diplomatic relations with Spain. [United Press, London, 15th] Madrid Radio broadcast tonight, stating, "There is a secret anti-Franco agreement between France and the Soviet Union, stipulating that Soviet troops may enter Spain via France through the German and Austrian occupied zones."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th] Sources in the French Foreign Ministry today refuted the Madrid Radio broadcast regarding a secret agreement between the Soviet Union and France.</p>

<h3>Chen Bijun on Trial, Actually Argues Back with the Prosecutor</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Suzhou, 16th</p>
<p>Today, during the High Court's trial of traitor Chen Bijun, courtroom order was as the presiding judge stated, "Completely unacceptable!" Repeatedly shouting, "Intolerable!" According to court officials, the scene was unprecedented in its spectacle, and the disorder was also unparalleled.</p>
<p>Because Chen Bijun is a woman, the number of female spectators attending the court today was higher than at previous trials of other traitors, accounting for about three or four tenths of the audience.</p>
<p>Wang Wenxuan, the daughter of traitor Wang Jingwei, wearing a plain-colored cheongsam, arrived at the court at 12:50 PM with two female friends wearing indigo-dyed cloth cheongsams. As they entered the court, the press corps rushed forward to ask for her impressions. Wang's attitude was natural. According to reports, she stated that she had come to listen and prepare for reporters' questions and that she would only speak after the trial was over. They quietly stood aside until the trial was over, then hired a car and left. Wang's daughter indicated that tomorrow, the newspaper would report, "Wang Jingwei's daughter attended the court."</p>
<p>Chen Bijun was escorted to the courthouse by half-carriage from the detention center at about 2:00 PM. Chen Bijun usually dislikes photography reporters taking pictures, but today, although she wanted to refuse, it was not possible!</p>
<p>Chen Bijun was wearing a blue silk cheongsam, with some gray hair, a fountain pen in her collar, a jade bracelet on her left hand, and a watch on her right hand. She was obese, had a rosy complexion, a calm demeanor, and spoke Cantonese-accented Mandarin, sharply and clearly. She often performed with an oratorical posture, hoping to gain sympathy. She was truly a "treasure" (Puppet) of the female world!</p>
<p>In reading her defense, Chen Bijun first declared that she was not hoping to be exempted from punishment, but only to confess. As to how the audience listened to it, she did not care. In her defense, she criticized many points in the prosecutor's indictment, as well as the inappropriate and erroneous use of words, and asked the prosecutor to provide concrete proof, causing the presiding judge to hurriedly flip through the evidence while Chen Bijun continued her defense.</p>
<p>When Chen Bijun's defense came to an end, applause actually rose from the audience, which was immediately stopped by the presiding judge, who said, "This is a court, not a speech. Spectators should have common sense!"</p>
<p>Chen Bijun claimed, "I am a 56-year-old woman, with a 77-year-old mother, two sons, three daughters, and two grandchildren. I could have been at home holding my grandchildren, but I could not abandon the tens of millions of people in the occupied areas. Hoping to alleviate the suffering of the people, I endured humiliation and hardship, so that I could comfort the spirits of the late Premier and Wang Jingwei in heaven," and her voice was mixed with sobs at the end.</p>
<p>The court asked Chen Bijun: Did you approve of Wang Jingwei's peace proposition? She answered: "Absolutely approve!" Her tone was heavy and forceful.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the prosecutor refuted Chen Bijun's defense, believing that Chen Bijun was influenced by Wang Jingwei's fundamentally flawed ideas, which led to a lack of clarity in her thinking. Chen Bijun retorted: "One cannot judge heroes by success or failure. If the Japanese had not advanced south, what situation would China be in now?" She seemed to extremely regret Japan's policy errors, which led to the failure of the peace movement! When Chen Bijun argued back, the prosecutor became stern and greatly angered. Chen Bijun was also sharp and mean, pressing her point aggressively, creating a tense situation. The presiding judge intervened in time to inquire about other issues, and the atmosphere began to ease.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi's Nagging</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Suzhou, 15th</p>
<p>Escorted by Carriage</p>
<p>Crowds Gather to See the Arch-Traitor</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, who is over sixty years old, was escorted by carriage, his favorite mode of transportation in the past, from the detention center to the courthouse at 2:00 PM on the 15th. The only difference was that in the past, he was usually accompanied by a female athlete who drove the carriage and paraded it through the streets for people to admire. Today, he sat quietly in a corner of the carriage under the supervision of bailiffs, only to be "admired" by ten thousand people as a prisoner.</p>
<p>Long Gown and Trousers</p>
<p>Yu Si's Face Reveals Old Age</p>
<p>Chu Minyi's defense lasted for two hours, with many repetitions and digressions, unable to avoid the typical ailments of an elderly person. Waving his hands and talking eloquently, he behaved as if he was delivering a speech, trying to appear calm. Today, he wore a fine woolen gown, a small French-style hat, and had trousers tied at the ankles. His beard was full.</p>
<p>Nagging and Tedious</p>
<p>High-Pitched Voice, Slow Tune</p>
<p>Chu Minyi interspersed his defense with story-like narrations, nagging and tediously, making listeners feel confused. Because Chu Minyi's voice was quite high and his tone was slow, it was quite convenient for reporters to hear, but there were many digressions, nagging and tediously, making it difficult for reporters to grasp the central point, making it difficult to write, and thus giving reporters a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Does Not Admit to Being the Main Culprit</p>
<p>Claims to be No. 12 on the List of Traitors</p>
<p>Chu Minyi said that he was not worthy of the prosecutor's accusation that he was the main culprit of treason. According to his own ranking, the pseudo-foreign minister should be ranked as the 12th traitor, because above him were the five presidents of the five Yuan, the five vice-presidents of the five Yuan, and a minister of internal affairs.</p>
<p>In the Puppet Government</p>
<p>Chu Minyi Served as Puppet Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Chu Minyi claimed that when he was the pseudo-foreign minister, he did not sign the basic treaty with Japan or the declaration of war against Britain and the United States. The prosecutor retorted, "In that case, you were the puppet foreign minister in the puppet government!"</p>
<p>"Golden Signboard"</p>
<p>"Smashed by the Corrupt?"</p>
<p>Chu Minyi deeply hated the corrupt officials and those who used their power to extort money in the pseudo-organization, because they had smashed the so-called "peaceful resistance against Japan" golden signboard!</p>
<p>Gambling with Japan</p>
<p>"After Eating the White Tiger, There is a Green Dragon"</p>
<p>According to his confession, the Japanese believed that China was the most difficult to deal with. China had two governments, Chongqing and Nanjing, just like having two doors to bet on, with one you gamble on, after eating the White Tiger, there is still the Green Dragon. Therefore, they had no good feelings towards the pseudo-government. Unexpectedly, Japan surrendered too quickly, and the pseudo-government lost the chance to act as an internal response to the central government, which seemed to be Chu Minyi's only regret.</p>
<p>Feigning Mercy at the End</p>
<p>Pleading for Small Traitors</p>
<p>When Chu Minyi was defending himself, he pleaded for the small traitors in his status as a prisoner awaiting death, saying: "Except for those who are corrupt and extort money, the rest are forced by life circumstances." He requested that those who have been sentenced have their sentences reduced, and those who have not been arrested be exempted from prosecution, in order to "reserve talents for the country." Therefore, he believed that the central government's conditions for punishing traitors were not applicable at this time.</p>
<p>Chu Minyi Prays for Early Death</p>
<p>Admits that He is Old and Useless</p>
<p>After learning that traitors Miao Bin and Chen Gongbo had been sentenced to death, Chu Minyi knew that he would surely die and asked the presiding judge to sentence him to death three times, because he felt that although he was 64 years old, he was still strong and might still live for more than a decade. If he was sentenced to life imprisonment, it would waste prison food and damage the national treasury. Given that many people had nothing to eat, he really did not want the country to support such a useless old man. At the same time, he said that he liked to be active and would be unbearable to be confined in prison.</p>
<p>Defending Eloquently</p>
<p>Eyes Cast Towards the Press Corps</p>
<p>When Chu Minyi was defending or answering questions eloquently, he would often cast his eyes towards the press corps, as if he was afraid of misremembering something. He not only elaborated on everything but also said that there were many listeners (referring to the spectators) and that it would be okay to talk about it. According to reports, after Nanjing fell, Chu Minyi was the first to "return to the capital" and visit the mausoleum.</p>
<p>Chu Minyi Leaves the Court</p>
<p>The Sound of Crows and Magpies at Dusk</p>
<p>It was dusk. During the trial, the courtroom was silent, while outside, the crows and magpies were chirping, seeking a place to roost urgently, as if they were mourning for Chu Minyi.</p>
<p>The trial ended at 7:15 PM. When Chu Minyi was escorted back to the detention center, the crowd outside the courtroom was no less numerous than during Chen Bijun's trial.</p>
<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Freight Car Fire at Zhengyi Station</p>

<p>A Tragic Scene at the Zhongdong Theater</p>
<p>Since hiring the Zhonghua Guoju School to perform traditional opera, the Zhongdong Theater on Dongxin Road in our city has been doing well in terms of ticket sales. Order in the theater has been maintained by military police. Yesterday (the 13th) at 3:00 PM, six people wearing military uniforms and carrying four Browning pistols entered to watch a performance. Less than ten minutes later, someone suddenly fired a gun, and the bullet struck Wang Zhuoran, a shareholder of the theater, in the head, causing his brain to splatter, and he died instantly. It also injured Jiang Wenbin, a military platoon leader, in the right humerus, who was sent to the Brother's Hospital for treatment. The diagnosis was that the humerus had been shattered, and he might become disabled. After the incident, the theater was searched, and seven suspects, Song Mingde, Li Mingjiang, Liu Mingdao, Chen Guoqing, Hu Heng, and Zhang Xuede, were arrested, along with four Browning pistols, and taken to the battalion headquarters, where they were handed over to the military law department of the headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>A Large Quantity of Hidden Supplies Seized</p>
<p>The Jiaxing Enemy Property Handling Sub-Office received a report that the China Silk Company on Jiao Li Street had a one-story house built by the enemy on the mulberry garden, which stored a large quantity of supplies. The office dispatched section chief Shang Kuifu to the site along with representatives assigned by the county government's police bureau for inspection.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's General Election: First the Result, Then the Analysis</h3>
<p>The Japanese general election, which has been the focus of global attention, has now been announced. The reason why this general election has attracted worldwide attention is because everyone wants to see what kind of trends in Japan are reflected by this election. Supporting a democratic Japan is the general intention of the United Nations, and it is not difficult to discern whether Japan is moving towards the path of democracy from this general election. The results of this general election are as follows: the Liberal Party won 139 seats, the Social Democratic Party won 93 seats, the Progressive Party won 91 seats, the Cooperative Party won 16 seats, the Communist Party won 5 seats, and independents won 84 seats. The predecessor of the Liberal Party was the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government party), and the predecessor of the Progressive Party was the Minseitō (Democratic Constitutional Party). Speaking of the Seiyūkai, the impression of this party on the Chinese people is naturally the most profound. The author of the Tanaka Memorial was the president of the Seiyūkai when he formed the Tanaka Cabinet; Inukai Tsuyoshi also formed his cabinet as the president of the Seiyūkai. In the minds of the Chinese people, this is deeply and inextricably linked to Japanese militarists and aggression. The result of this general election is that the Liberal Party, the incarnation of the Seiyūkai, won the most seats. Therefore, it is worth noting how Japanese politics will evolve in the future. Regardless of whether the Shidehara Cabinet continues to exist, or whether the leader of the Liberal Party, Hatoyama Ichirō, comes out to form a coalition cabinet with various parties, the result of this general election has pointed out a trend, that is, Japan's conservatism is still very strong, and efforts to promote democratization still need support.</p>
<p>Originally, the Chinese people did not place much importance or expectation on this Japanese general election. The Japanese people have been ruled by militarists for a long time, and the road to democracy will definitely not be achieved overnight. It was expected that the Liberal Party, as the incarnation of the Seiyūkai, would obtain the most votes in this election by utilizing the original organization and momentum of the Seiyūkai. However, it is worth exploring how much potential there is for Japan's democratization as a result of this general election. According to recent news reports, two recent events in Japan are worth noting. (1) According to a United Press report from Tokyo on the 1st: Sakurajima volcano in southern Japan has been spewing ash and rocks for 22 days. The molten lava is boiling and flows at half a mile wide and two miles long, continuing to flow down the slope towards the small village of Kurokami at a rate of three to four feet per hour. It will soon flow into Kagoshima Bay and may solidify into a narrow path connecting Sakurajima with the main island of Kyushu. Some elderly villagers believe that Japan's defeat in the war has angered the gods, hence the volcanic eruption. It is said that the Emperor's younger brother recently went to a shrine in the mountains behind Kagoshima to inform the gods that Japan had been defeated. Not long after, the volcano erupted. (2) According to a Reuters report from Tokyo on the 6th: At Chofu airfield, fifteen miles west of Tokyo, the first organized act of sabotage by Japanese against the Allied forces occurred. All personnel of the U.S. Fifth Air Force stationed there have been ordered to be armed and on alert for 24 hours. Japanese rioters sneaked into the airfield in the dark, damaging transportation and aircraft equipment of great value, cutting telephone and telegraph lines, and destroying telegraph machines. Judging from the nature of the sabotage, it seems to have been carried out by people with specialized skills, so it is speculated that the saboteurs may be Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>The above two facts tell us that the stubborn thinking of the Japanese people has not changed due to this defeat in the war. Japan was defeated in the war, but the Japanese believe that they have angered the gods. Judging from their words, it is as if Japan should not have been defeated, so the gods are angry and spewing fire; if Japan had won, the gods would not be angry and would not spew fire! If this kind of thinking still exists in the hearts of the Japanese people, then the Japanese will definitely continue to dream the delusion of "Hakkō ichiu" (all the world under one roof)! In their dreams, they may still believe that this defeat is only temporary, and that the gods will protect the Japanese people and not only restore their inherent glory but also rule "all the world." From this small matter, it can be seen how deeply rooted Japan's aggressive thinking is, and how urgent the need for Japanese re-education is. As for the sabotage of the Allied airfield, since it was an organized action and carried out by Japanese with specialized skills, it can be seen that the Japanese people, even under the Allied occupation of Japan, are still not aware of the cause and effect of the defeat and are still secretly plotting. From the former fact, we can see how widespread and deeply ingrained aggressive thinking is among the Japanese people and needs to be clarified. From the latter fact, we can see that the Japanese people are ready to take retaliatory action at any time. All of this should prompt the Allied nations participating in the control of Japan to consider carefully when deciding on policies to control Japan.</p>
<p>Observing the results of this Japanese general election in conjunction with the previous two facts, it can be seen that it is still too early for the Japanese people to thoroughly realize their defeat. A democratic Japan still has to go through a long road. Therefore, the joint Allied occupation of Japan should last for a longer period; moreover, the methods and means of controlling Japan seem to require adjustment and strengthening. In Potsdam, the Allied powers decided to use Japan's existing institutions to govern Japan. Japan requested to retain the emperor system, but the Allied response was that the emperor must be subject to the control of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. This shows that Japan surrendered unconditionally, and the power to abolish or retain the entire system and institutions is in the hands of the Allied commander. Due to recent events in Japan, especially the victory of the Liberal Party, the incarnation of the Seiyūkai, in the general election, the latent nature of Japanese aggressive thinking is very strong. It is worth considering whether the decision to use Japan's existing institutions to govern Japan can be called wise.</p>
<p>Japan after the general election is still the same Japan with a new name; however, from the Japan of the Seiyūkai, it has become the Japan of the Liberal Party. The eradication of aggressive militarism and theocratic thinking still requires a very long period. It seems that the time has not yet come to rely on the Japanese people's own initiative to achieve democracy in Japan. The Allied occupation of Japan and the re-education of Japan must be intensified from now on, until the remaining Japanese traditional thinking, that is, Japanese aggressive thinking, is completely eradicated, and only then can Japan truly embark on the path of democratization.</p>

Since the Bureau divided the city into six districts to handle land registration applications, it has registered more than 70,000 cases. The procedures for receiving registration documents have been gradually improved. In the future, each district will investigate all unregistered land according to the map.

<h3>Long-Term Residents of Mingyuanfang Petitioned the City Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] More than 300 long-term residents of Mingyuanfang, located at the intersection of Huade Road and Taowu Road, petitioned the city government in a group at about 11 o'clock yesterday morning, demanding that all the houses in the Fang currently occupied by Jews who colluded with the enemy be vacated and returned to the original tenants. According to the petitioners, they lived in the Fang before April 1943, and legally leased houses. On April 21 of that year, a large group of Jewish refugees colluded with the enemy, brutally beat the residents of the Fang, and forcibly occupied the houses by force, and have lived there until now. The city government immediately sent Wang Zhaoquan of the Secretariat to receive them, and promised to give a reasonable solution in the near future, and will report all the requests to the mayor for instructions.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Others and Forging Documents; Blatantly Breaking Into the Military Law Office; Attempting to Deceive and Release Criminals; Chen Shiqing Was Audacious and Reckless</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters has repeatedly seized lawless people impersonating soldiers and swindling under false pretenses recently. At the beginning of this month, a person named Tang Duanbao was arrested for wearing a military uniform and swaggering through the city. After interrogation, it was found that he did not have military status, and he was immediately taken to the court for investigation. Suddenly, a letter was received from Wang Tiehan, commander of the 49th Army, stating that Tang was a plainclothes member of the army and was dispatched to work in Shanghai and was mistakenly arrested, requesting his release. After receiving the letter, the Garrison Headquarters immediately informed the army that the criminal had been sent to the court. Several days later, another letter was received from the army, with a completely different tone from the previous one, denying that there was such a person as Tang Ruibao, and upon further identification, the official seal on the letter was completely different. Just as it was about to investigate, two young men dressed in American military uniforms suddenly came yesterday morning, one of whom was wearing a revolver. They claimed to be the major deputy battalion commander of the Special Service Battalion of the 49th Army, and came directly to the Military Law Office with the letter to question why the criminal Tang had not been released. They also claimed that they were dispatched to come and wanted to take Tang back to the military headquarters, etc. Upon inspecting the documents, it was known that they were the ones who forged the official documents of the 49th Army, and they were immediately detained for interrogation. According to the confession, the name is Chen Shiqing, from Hangzhou, 26 years old, living at No. 10 Xinkai Road, Hangzhou, and has been working as a porter. Recently, in order to facilitate travel, he and Tang Ruibao, who had been arrested, conspired to impersonate soldiers. In order to show off, he bought two pistols in Hangzhou. After Tang was arrested, he repeatedly sent letters urging him to find a way, and in desperation, he took this measure. The other person, Xu Shuren, is indeed a second lieutenant assistant at the Military Uniform Factory of the Ministry of Military Administration. He met Chen at a friend's house at No. 30 Wuchang Road yesterday morning, and Chen invited him to go to the Garrison Headquarters together, but he did not know about the forgery of documents. According to the confession, Chen committed the crime of daring to impersonate a soldier, forging documents, and blatantly breaking into the Military Law Office in an attempt to deceive and release criminals, which is illegal. He was immediately taken into custody for strict interrogation.</p>
<h3>Results of Miscellaneous Grain Bidding</h3>

<h3>Residents of the French Concession Petition; Authorities Conduct On-Site Investigation</h3>
<p>Relocation subsidies will be decided in a few days. [Our Reporter] The residents of the French Concession in this city petitioned the city government the day before yesterday to exempt them from demolition. In order to clarify the actual situation, make a final plan, and minimize inconvenience to the residents as much as possible, the Engineering Bureau authorities sent Zheng Dekui, Director of the Third District Engineering Office, and several engineers from the Structural Office and the Ditch Engineering Office to inspect the area at 10 a.m. yesterday. The residents' representatives of the district were invited to investigate together, which took six hours. As a result, it was considered that the Concession was indeed extremely dirty, and at the same time, the ditches were blocked and the riverbed was high. The French Concession is an important drainage channel in western Shanghai, which has a great impact and must be thoroughly dredged. According to the person in charge, the width of the dredging of the riverbed of the Concession is 4 meters, and the depth of the dredging of the silt is 1 meter to 1.5 meters. The width of the riverbank must be determined according to the soil quality of the slope, otherwise it will still collapse. It has now been decided to exempt the houses outside the bridge abutment with the old bridgehead as the boundary from demolition. Each tile house will be given a relocation fee of 56,000 yuan, and each thatched house will be given 28,000 yuan. In order to enable people from all walks of life to understand the actual situation, the Bureau has specially scheduled to invite personnel from various agencies to visit at 3 p.m. tomorrow.</p>

The High Court also heard two other cases on the same day. One was the case of Finnish national Hämäläinen, who served as a consul in Shanghai during the enemy-puppet occupation period. He was recently accused of smuggling military supplies, collecting intelligence, and supplying it to the enemy, and the High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution. During yesterday's trial, the defendant vehemently denied the charges. The court ordered further investigation, and the case was adjourned for another hearing. The defendant was still allowed to be released on the original bail. Another case involved Li Hu from Sichuan, who was accused of serving as a deputy officer and acting captain of the escort team of the enemy's Central China Fisheries Company. He was detained by the police and transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation, after which a public prosecution was filed. During yesterday's hearing by the collegiate panel, the defendant stated: He joined the military after the "January 28th" Incident and, after the "August 13th" Incident, Shanghai fell. He lost contact with his unit and stayed in Shanghai to make a living and never served in a puppet organization. He claimed that the current accusation was a false accusation due to personal grudges. The court announced the conclusion of the argument and scheduled the sentencing for 2:30 PM on the 23rd.</p>

<h3>Uncertain Foothold Leads to Continued Gold Price Decline; Fewer Settlements Cause US Dollar to Fall as Well</h3>
<p>After the Bank of China's strike yesterday caused it to rise and then fall back, the market clearly showed more profit-taking. It once broke through the 1.5 million mark in the morning, and then stabilized slightly. Upon investigation, it opened flat, and the situation was stable after opening, struggling for a long time around 1.54 million. The Bank of China's allocation price remained the same, the market price was low, and no one wanted it, but after that, the bullish camp gradually weakened, and the goods purchased in the previous few days were gradually released, gradually decreasing. Some bulls panicked, breaking through the 1.5 million mark in the morning, retreating to 1.49 million, and then stabilizing slightly. The situation was more stable in the afternoon, hovering around 1.52 million. As a result, it continued to fall by 30,000 compared to the previous close. Gold jewelry was 166,000, silver was 1,500, and silver dollars were also flat. The unofficial discount rate was 1.2 to 1.5 cents due to loose money market conditions, while the outside market was about 1.6 to 3 cents.</p>
<p>The buying of US dollars temporarily stopped, and more were released. At first, it hovered around 2,050 yuan. As the price of gold fell back, the US dollar also slightly declined. With fewer settlements, the supply exceeded demand yesterday. It once broke the 2,000 yuan mark in the morning and recovered slightly at noon. It hovered around 2,020 yuan in the afternoon. As a result, it continued to fall by 20 yuan compared to the previous close. The gold arbitrage was about 750 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong banknotes were mediocre, with old banknotes slightly down and new banknotes flat. The US exchange rate, rupees, and Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were all flat. Non-compliant imported goods were all converted to buy US dollars for compensation.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Are Narrow, High Prices Appear Frequently</h3>
<p>Government bonds continued to be manipulated by major players in the industry yesterday. With the return of Beibang speculators, the opening price immediately broke through the 5,000 yuan mark, gradually rising from around 5,050 yuan to a new high of 5,350 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. At noon, it hovered around 5,250 yuan. The police investigated the old nest of the Securities Exchange Building, and storms arose in the middle, but because the bond market became increasingly dark, the trend was not universal. The noon close was still stable, resulting in another 300 yuan increase compared to the previous close. In addition, A, B, and D bonds rose slightly, while E bonds fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Stocks Gradually Weaken</h3>
<p>High prices of Chinese stocks are still difficult to sustain, and after being firm, they gradually weakened. Although the number of chips is low, the mentality of people in the industry is reversed. The bulls take profits when they are profitable, so good times do not last. Yong Yarn gradually fell from a high of 5,400 yuan in the middle of the session, Meiya from 4,500 yuan, and Jingfu from 450 yuan. Various unpopular stocks tended to stabilize uniformly. Xinguang and Qinxing, which were in the second hottest position, were bought up, and the market price gradually rose. Each veteran stock stopped investing and turned to buying, and the situation gradually stabilized. At noon, popular stocks closed at low prices, while unpopular stocks closed at high prices, going in opposite directions, and the price difference narrowed. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn and Jingfu rose slightly, Meiya rose by half, and Xinguang and Qinxing rose by about 10%. Unpopular stocks and veteran stocks were all stable. In the afternoon, the call prices for futures contracts for Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Liangfu were slightly higher, while Xinguang and Qinxing were slightly lower. Yesterday, a certain trust company in Guangdong made a profit and sold a lot of Yisha, so the upward trend was difficult to sustain. There was still activity with many short positions in the morning. Yisha saw a high price of 14,200 yuan, but after rising, it turned to consolidation. The bulls' mentality was that if they did not advance, they would retreat, and the camp was shaken, falling back sharply. Yisha once fell to the edge of the 13,000 mark and then stabilized. The noon close was down 10% for paper industry and Asia, and down about 5% for the rest.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market started strong and then weakened. In the early morning, due to the very small allocation of 20-count yarn by the Textile Construction Corporation to the industry on the previous day, the supply was tighter, so it continued to rise by 30,000 to 40,000. Then, because buyers and traders had no profit, they all adopted a wait-and-see attitude and fell back by 20,000. Shuangma once rose to 1.12 million, but finally closed at 1.07 million, only rising by 10,000 compared to the previous day. The other miscellaneous brands rose by 20,000, and the 32-count Xiantao double-strand thread rose by 50,000 because the Textile Construction Corporation did not supply any of the companies that applied to purchase the thread on the 15th. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Corporation opened for sale 20 kinds of cotton cloth and 16 kinds of Mexican cloth. Today, it opened for sale cotton yarn, wool, and silk products as usual.</p>
<p>Recently, American and Indian cotton from foreign countries has been arriving one after another. Because the selling price of local cotton is too high, it has fallen into difficulties. Most holders are unwilling to sell cheaply at reduced prices, so the market is cold. The American cotton ordered by the Textile Construction Corporation has been imported one after another, and tens of thousands of bales of Indian cotton have also arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, the spot price of raw cotton has not been opened for several days, and manufacturers in general can take this opportunity to obtain cheap raw materials. Currently, manufacturers can make a profit of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per bale of yarn, and it is expected that the price of yarn will gradually ease in the future.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Textile Export Volume for the Second Quarter Has Been Determined by the Administration</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] The export volume of US cotton textiles for the second quarter has been stipulated by the Civilian Production Administration as 9.6% of the total cotton textile production. (Note: The export volume approved for the first quarter of this year was 11%.) According to this stipulated volume, 232,500,000 yards of cotton goods can be exported. (Note: 255,300,000 yards for the first quarter.) However, industry insiders believe that the actual change in cotton goods exports will not be as significant as announced, as the production volume in the second quarter will increase rather than decrease. According to the Civilian Production Administration, the decrease in cotton textile exports in the second quarter is due to the gradual recovery of cotton textile manufacturing in Europe. It also stated that the bureau will try to increase the export volume of raw cotton.</p>
<h3>Congestion in Local Warehouses Affects the Import of US Cotton</h3>
<p>[China News Agency, Washington, 16th] Officials of the Export-Import Bank announced here yesterday that due to difficulties in US dollar exchange rates and other war-related problems, a large amount of American cotton shipped to China cannot be sold, and other cotton payments based on cash on delivery have not been cleared. As a result, Shanghai's limited port space and warehouses have become congested, resulting in delays in unloading ships and increased storage charges. Officials from the Chinese government and the Washington Export-Import Bank, in view of this, have consulted on possible solutions to alleviate the congestion. As a result of the consultation, they agreed that all American cotton consigned, cash on delivery, or still awaiting payment should be used as funds for the recent cotton loan from the Export-Import Bank to the Bank of China under the guarantee of the Chinese government. American cotton exporters, whether consignment or cash on delivery, can request payment from the above loan. This policy also applies to European countries.</p>
<h3>Oil and Grain Fall Slightly, Rice Price Rises Alone</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market responded to the frequent increases in the inland areas. Japonica and Indica rice continued to rise by 500 to 1,000 yuan, and hundred-yuan rice also increased by more than 1,000 yuan. Sales of flour to foreign ports were temporarily suspended, and the local market adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The price fell by 300 to 400 yuan, as did wheat bran, which fell slightly by 100 yuan. Soybean cake followed the decline of other goods and fell by 200 yuan. Soybean exports were stagnant, and domestic sales showed weakness. Medium and low prices fell by 300 to 500 yuan. The oil market's demand from the inland areas weakened, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. All grains, except for the price of rice, fell uniformly. It is also reported that, according to information from the rice market, a total of more than 5,000 stones of seven varieties of rice, including white japonica, arrived in the city yesterday, namely 2,829 stones of white japonica, 62 stones of white yuan, 339 stones of sheep indica, 624 stones of Du indica, 695 stones of early rice, 1,143 stones of thin rice, and 24 stones of Yin yuan.</p>
<h3>Fujian Tea Loan of 100 Million, Preliminary Production of 57.2 Million, Refined Production of 42.8 Million</h3>

<h3>Revision of Customs Tariff</h3>
<p>Authorities Formulate Six Principles</p>
<p>In order to cooperate with the domestic and foreign economic situation and China's construction plan, the financial authorities are reportedly planning to revise the import and export tariff again. The principles include six points, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Important materials that are lacking domestically, difficult to produce locally, or subject to production restrictions should be exempted from tax.</p>
<p>(2) Equipment and materials related to national defense or economic construction, where domestic products are insufficient, should be taxed at a low rate.</p>
<p>(3) Imported goods that may hinder the development of domestic production should be taxed at a high rate.</p>
<p>(4) Luxury goods or non-essential goods should be taxed heavily.</p>
<p>(5) All high-quality domestic raw materials and export goods that should be retained domestically should be taxed separately, and other goods will be exempted from export tax.</p>
<p>(6) Expand the implementation of protective tariffs. Measures such as manufacturing plants and tax refunds for raw materials are still being drafted, with the principle of encouraging export industries.</p>

The special commissioner for the Jinghu area received 26 units of enemy-puppet schools and cultural institutions, and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau received 19 units.

<h3>World-Renowned Players to Compete: Wimbledon Tennis Tournament to Resume This Summer, Starting June 24</h3>
<p>[United Press, Wimbledon, England, 15th] The Wimbledon International Lawn Tennis Championships will be revived this summer. Although the court still bears the scars of German bombs, the grass is beautifully green. According to an official of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, the news of Wimbledon's resumption after a seven-year hiatus has generated immense interest. During the war, one bomb hit the grounds, destroying 1,200 of the 10,000 seats around the Centre Court. As Britain is currently busy repairing damaged houses, it has no time to attend to sports grounds, so the damaged portions of the court may not be repaired for this year's tournament. Due to transportation difficulties, the All England Lawn Tennis Club plans to cancel the qualifying rounds for this year's tournament, with only players selected by the tournament committee participating in the competition from June 24 to July 6. The events will include men's and women's singles and doubles, and mixed doubles. The list of players will be announced in late May. According to Tennis Club Secretary Macaulay, "Countries around the world have been inquiring about the tournament. Tennis competition has quickly returned to its former glory in European countries affected by the war, with almost everyone having the ambition to win the championship. China will also participate in the competition. South American countries have expressed keen interest, and the United States will send a strong team as usual. British players will be younger, lack practice, and have generally not encountered strong opponents."</p>

<h3>Prodigal Son Returns</h3>
<p>— Xuehua</p>
<p>Two years ago, I wrote a story that began with light and ended in darkness, so many friends said to me, "You've got it backwards! It should begin with darkness and end with light; that's the right way."</p>
<p>At a certain period, the story of the prodigal son's return indeed seemed to have become a set pattern. No matter what literary magazine you opened, whether it was a novel or short story, they were almost all the same: there was always a prodigal son wallowing in darkness, reckless, depraved, suffering greatly, and finally realizing his mistake, turning back, and embarking on a path of light.</p>
<p>Shouldn't a prodigal son wallowing in darkness turn back? Of course, absolutely yes! Since humans are born from desire, they are inevitably tempted by it, and they cannot avoid stumbling and falling. As long as they don't fall all the way down, as long as they are willing to turn back, "turning back is the shore," they may well regain the light. So the story of the prodigal son's return is meaningful; it curses darkness and praises light.</p>
<p>However, I often feel that people are curious creatures, especially young people. When they hold a story of the prodigal son's return and read it with relish, perhaps the final moment of light is in the minority, while longing for the moment of wild revelry and intoxication when the prodigal son wallows and falls is in the majority?</p>
<p>Young people are also the boldest. Although hell is terrible, if someone tells them that they can still come out after entering hell, they might say, "Then I might as well jump in and play!"</p>
<p>I don't oppose the story of the prodigal son's return, but sometimes I can't help but have some misgivings: because the prodigal son can return, will it create more prodigal sons?</p>
<h3>Dead Soul</h3>
<p>— Huang Wenjin</p>
<p>He quietly lowered the tattered window curtains and lit the dim blue desk lamp. A faint ray of light shone on the picture frame. He smiled at the image of himself from a year ago. He remembered that she had accompanied him to have that smart evening suit made, and her lipstick stain still remained on the snow-white shirt.</p>
<p>The withered petals of the narcissus hung on the table, resting next to the train ticket. He sighed and picked up the withered petals and the ticket, putting them together in his bag.</p>
<p>He opened the closet, which was empty. Those luxurious clothes were probably on display in the windows of used clothing stores at this moment. Suddenly, he found something in the corner—that most cursed black hat! He unconsciously bowed his head in silence.</p>
<p>He felt some shame. It seemed that a sin tree that could not be destroyed had already been planted in his heart. How many base deeds were growing on those black branches.</p>
<p>Black hat, who could forget these traitors during the war.</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered himself. This was a dead soul that had been numb for many years, like a pair of poisoned and rotten shoes that could never step on the bright road again. Those days of drunken revelry.</p>
<p>He raised his head regretfully. Good times cannot be turned back. Many beautiful images appeared one after another, and the groans of those he had trampled on echoed in his ears. These were the charming laughter of subordinates, those dazzling eyes, diamonds, jewels, and money poured into his black hat like lake water.</p>
<p>"As long as you love me, I will always love you..."</p>
<p>But now no one paid attention to him anymore. The skyscrapers were still brightly lit, and his beautiful dreams were shattered by wind and rain, so easily, from stepping onto the jeep...</p>
<p>The sound of the whistle woke him from his daze. Nothing was his. Now was the time for him to leave this city, taking with him his only possession—a dead soul.</p>
<h3>A Little Talk About Music</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>One evening, for various reasons, I was extremely annoyed and lay in bed worrying, unable to sleep. Just then, a series of chimes suddenly came from next door. First, they were low and soft, then suddenly slow and strong, gradually rising, faster, faster, and then with a "clang!" In an instant, it was like ten thousand horses galloping and ten thousand drums beating! At this time, I couldn't help but forget all my pain and annoyance. I only felt that my heart had followed the majestic sound of the chimes and flown to the heights of the sky. All the chaotic worldly affairs had left me far, far away!…</p>
<p>"Music is the key to heaven!" In recent years, after becoming neighbors with a friend who is proficient in music, I often have an indescribable experience and feeling, and I often say this to my friends.</p>
<p>I don't understand the various forms of music, so I won't talk about them for the time being, but I will just make a few small suggestions about music:</p>
<p>First, I think that when a patient is dying, it is better to play a quiet piece of music by his bedside than to cry and shout loudly in front of his bed.</p>
<p>Second, I think it might be a good idea for the country to encourage people to invent a new type of abacus, so that every time an abacus bead is moved, it can emit a burst of beautiful music.</p>
<p>Third, when many high-ranking officials are arguing and turning red in the face in some meeting, it is best for the host to announce a stop to the speeches and immediately replace them with various pleasant and melodious music. When everyone's red veins on their foreheads have receded, the meeting can continue.</p>
<h3>An Ancient Day</h3>
<p>A day that has continued for thousands of years, a day that can never be abolished. Most of the pedestrians on the street have drowsy eyes, squeezing and crowding the street like a tide. They all seem quite exciting and quite happy, especially in Shanghai, which has been suffering for eight years. Everyone is very excited as this ancient custom returns.</p>
<p>The pain of the past, the old hatred and new grievances, are all temporarily abandoned. Under the stone "Protect My Coast," people crowded into the City God Temple, which had been separated for eight years. The atmosphere of incense confused the minds of many men and women. They each had different grand wishes, silently pleading in front of the Bodhisattva. The city corner stretched out its hand, silently accepting this heartfelt plea, this secret that they didn't want to reveal to the world.

<p>The Zigzag Bridge is well? Broken railings everywhere, the wounds of劫 are impossible to hide. The green clothes under the bridge no longer aroused the interest of travelers to lean on the railing and watch. Huh! In front of the City God Temple, how many precious souls have been abandoned in front of the City God?</p>
<p>Walking up to Songyuelou—the ancient vegetarian restaurant—to re-taste the annual vegetarian meal has a special flavor. After eating, leaning against the window and looking out, the street is bustling and bustling. Who would believe that this place has undergone eight years of vicissitudes? Looking at the tightly closed door of "Inner Reading," I wonder if it is also so exciting inside! If it weren't for the warm sunshine reflecting on wisps of incense, forming layers of intangible colorful shadows, I really wouldn't know what day it was today, this ancient day!</p>
<h3>Crossing Qin Tower: Basha North Spring Counts Sails Late, Sitting Huangzhong Shang Yi Dream Window</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jun</p>
<p>The waves twist around alone, the cold air is gray, and the ten thousand emeralds are obscured by mist. The ripples open the green bamboo, the stones fall, and the red rises. The clouds swallow and spit, the swallows return to peek into the curtains, whisper and discuss, and caress the eaves affectionately. I wonder how long the travelers have been away, thinking of the flag pavilion, and where is the beauty. The memories of ten thousand drops of weeping marks, and strands of red jade, have all entered the boundless forest. The cooking soup dissipates the heat, and the banyan tree roots condense, just like the pillars of old love. Afraid of secretly setting up by the railing, the ship comes on the river, and the setting sun extends. Watching the eastward flowing water, the lonely sail drifts away.</p>
<h3>Flying in Pairs (27)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>"But, Master! You've been getting along well all these years, why are you suddenly getting serious now? Alas! It's all the fault of drinking! You're probably still drunk!" Mo Sheng's tone contained some complaints. Because he was afraid that Mo Taitai would retaliate tomorrow, and Mo Laoye would suffer. He knew that Mo Taitai would not let Mo Laoye off lightly.</p>
<p>Mo Laoye shook his head and sighed:</p>
<p>"I've been tolerating it as much as I can!"</p>
<p>Then a violent cough made Mo Laoye almost unable to breathe. Mo Sheng fed him some water, but it didn't help. Moreover, Mo Laoye began to shout that his lungs hurt and wanted Mo Sheng to massage him. Then Mo Sheng discovered that Mo Laoye's temperature was terrifyingly high! He couldn't help but exclaim:</p>
<p>"What? Master, you have a fever!"</p>
<p>Mo Laoye didn't pay attention to Mo Sheng's words, only felt that his chest was vibrating as if it was about to explode! He pounded it with his own hands. And gradually felt his breath blocked and his mind凝, as if a mountain fell down and pressed on him. He was sucked into a gloomy abyss!</p>
<p>"Master! Master! What, what's wrong with you?"</p>
<p>Mo Sheng shouted as he helped Mo Laoye up and used his fingers to pinch his philtrum (the lower end of the nose). After about a quarter of an hour, Mo Laoye woke up again and slowly recovered his light breathing.</p>
<p>Mo Laoye was sick!</p>
<p>At this time, Mo Taitai was still crying and scolding in the main room. Mo Sheng listened to these two symphonies of weeping and groaning. He didn't know what to do? In normal times, he might be able to ask Mo Taitai to find a doctor for Mo Laoye, or ask for some ginseng to make some soup for Mo Laoye to drink. But now he didn't dare, and he couldn't! Mo Taitai was angry, and if he told Mo Taitai, Mo Taitai would definitely not listen to reason. What to do? He was simply at a loss! He could only accompany Mo Laoye and worry about getting through this tormenting night.</p>
<p>Mo Laoye later fell asleep in confusion.</p>
<p>The next day, Mo Laoye's illness still hadn't improved, and he coughed up a lot of phlegm. This phenomenon caused Mo Sheng great fear. He had plucked up the courage to tell Mo Taitai, and as expected, Mo Taitai ignored him. Mo Sheng tossed and turned, and finally made his own decision and hired a doctor for Mo Laoye. After examination, the doctor said that Mo Laoye had tuberculosis and needed to nourish his lungs and strengthen his stomach. Only after a long period of rest, without labor or anger, could he gradually recover.</p>
<p>This was tantamount to announcing Mo Laoye's death sentence. He couldn't possibly have adequate and good medical treatment. Mo Taitai, out of resentment for Mo Laoye, wouldn't take out a penny. It was all up to Mo Sheng, and there was no way. As for rest, that was even more impossible. Mo Laoye's living environment was an environment of anger. Therefore, it seemed that Mo Laoye's illness had little hope of recovery.</p>
<p>Bao Ling and Li Hua took turns serving Mo Laoye, but whenever Mo Taitai saw them, they would inevitably be scolded. Because of this, the children and Mo Sheng were very distressed!</p>

<h3>Answers to Readers – Legal Questions</h3>
<p>Feng Renling asks: In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), I borrowed 300 yuan in foreign currency from my relative, with a written IOU stating no interest. However, at that time, my relative insisted that I and my three children sign together as proof. Since the children were not present, I signed all three names myself. Now I want to return this amount, but my relative insists on calculating it based on the pre-war rice price, and mediation has been ineffective. Now I have several questions to ask: (1) Can this loan be calculated based on the pre-war rice price? (The IOU does not specify this.) (2) Since the children did not sign, will they have any repayment responsibility in the future? (3) To avoid future disputes if this debt is not repaid, can I publish a statement in the newspaper declaring it invalid after a certain period, or are there any remedies? (4) What is the statute of limitations for an IOU, how many years before it expires?</p>
<p>Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers: (1) Since the loan does not have a special agreement, the currency in general circulation at the time of the loan in 1938 is the same as the current currency. According to the law, it can be repaid in national currency at the original amount. The creditor cannot claim that it must be calculated based on the pre-war rice price. (2) Although the children did not sign the IOU, if they inherit the estate in the future, they will be jointly and severally liable according to the law. (3) If you want to repay this debt, you can first notify the creditor to receive it. If the receipt is delayed, you can deposit it according to the law, which will eliminate the debt relationship. (4) Ordinary claims expire after fifteen years of non-exercise.</p>
<p>Shen He asks: My grandparents borrowed 100 yuan in national currency from a certain family, with a copy of the deed for a 2.2% share of a house and land as collateral. It has been more than 20 years since then. My grandparents and father have passed away, and only my mother is alive. She is very unfamiliar with this matter. The certain family also only has a grandson alive. Now they are demanding 100 silver yuan from me, converted to legal currency (92,000 yuan in legal currency). I cannot afford such a huge amount. Please ask the following questions: (1) Does the law have such a provision? (2) If I cannot afford to repay, can they sue me in court? (3) How should I repay according to the law? (4) Can a new copy of the old deed for the house and land be made?</p>
<p>Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers: (1) The law does not have such a provision. (2) If a debt is not repaid, the creditor can sue in court, but they cannot make demands outside the law. (3) If the contract has no special agreement, this debt can be repaid in general national currency at the original amount according to the law. (4) Since the old copy of the deed for the house and land was used as collateral for the loan, it should be redeemed by repaying the debt, and a new deed cannot be made.</p>
