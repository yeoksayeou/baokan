<h3>願保持超然地位　繼續爲調處努力　民主同盟發表書面談話</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京廿四日電﹞中國民主同盟於廿四日下午二時半，舉行記者招待會，發表書面談話如下：</p>
<p>中國民主同盟的目的，是實現中國的民主。但團結，統一，和平是國家實現民主的先決條件。因此民盟從成立的時候起，就決定站在第三者的立場，努力調解國共的武力衝突。一個分裂的國家，一個繼續不斷從事內戰的國家，是不會有民主的。我們在過去是這樣的看法，在今天還是這樣的看法。</p>
<p>本年一月舉行的政治協商會議，的確爲解決國是開闢了一個明確而且光明的途徑。倘當權負責的政黨，眞能依據政協決定的程序及早實行了五項決議，我們絕對相信中國局面必早有了進步。不幸過去十個月中，許多次的團結，統一，和平的機會，都錯過了。</p>
<p>從本年二月起，直到今天，民盟始終堅守兩個原則：</p>
<p>第一·民盟擁護政協。因爲民盟是政協的參加者，所以我們有遵守政協決議的義務，同時我們有督促各方實行政協決議的責任。政協決議是參加會議各黨派的一種契約，這亦可說是中國求得和平與民主的一種大憲章。國民大會要依據協議的草案而制定。這可說明政協決議的重要與尊嚴了。倘這種契約，參加的任何一方可以任意撕毀，那末今後中國就談不到法治，更談不到憲政與民主。</p>
<p>第二·民盟反對內戰。民盟是個沒有武力的政黨，民盟絕對相信無論當權或在野的政黨擁有武力，國家不會有和平，更永遠不能走上民主的正軌。並且今天中國全體老百姓一致反對內戰。因此十個月來，民盟始終是超然獨立的第三者，努力調解國共兩黨間的武力衝突。這兩件事是相互關連的，因爲要有和平，纔能實行政協五項決議，要忠誠實施政協五項決議，纔能保障中國的永久和平。這說明十個月來民盟的一切工作的途徑及其苦心。</p>
<p>十月廿一日民盟政協代表，接受政府代表邀約，與其他黨派政協代表及社會賢達共同來京，我們一切努力始終未離開上面兩個原則。我們一面爭取依據政協決議程序實行五項決議，一面呼籲和平謀取停止武力的黨爭。直到十一月十四日的夜間，國大開幕的前夕，所謂的第三方面，竭盡心力，猶未能挽救時間，同時其他黨派及社會賢達，亦可就其立場最後決定了他們自己的行動，我們民盟代表才迫不得已暫時停止了我們的調解工作。智所不逮，力盡而止，這是我們願求諒國人的一點。</p>
<p>民盟拒絕參加十一月十五日舉行的國民大會，理由很簡單：這次召集的國大，違背了政協決議的整個精神，破裂了政協決議的程序，並且這次國大不是全國團結統一的制憲會議，這是舉世共同承認的事實。民盟旣已歷次宣言擁護政協，並歷次宣言絕對不參加任何方面可以增強分裂的行動，民盟今天自應謹守諾言以取信國人。民主憲政的基礎，是全國人共同立法，全國人一致守法。必先有共同立法的實質，而後才能得到一致守法的實效。制憲是國家的一件重大事業，憲法內容固然重要，而產生憲法機構的法律根據更爲重要。基本大法來源的，合法與非法問題，常常引起國家長期的紛爭與分裂。世界歷史上往例固多，中華民國歷史上的實例亦多。我們明知民盟即令參加當前的國大，除自身陷於自毀政協決議的錯誤而外，無補於將來的憲政，更無補於當前國家的團結統一與和平，因此我們只有超然置身事外的途徑，以求良心之所安。</p>
<p>民盟這種態度，絕對不是消極，今天中國現實政治，必先求得國共兩黨停止武力衝突，而後有和平，必先有了和平，而後才嫩有憲政與民主，從老百姓的立場來說，人民必先有生存的機會，而後才能談到憲法，必先停止這殘酷不仁的內戰，而後人民才有生存的機會。中國當前有無數個問題待解決，但最迫切最緊要的問題，是停止國共兩黨的武力戰爭。我們民盟認清楚了這個重大關鍵，因此我們願保持在內戰環境中超然獨立的第三者地位，在調解武力黨爭上繼續謀其最大的努力，以爭取國家的眞和平，促成國家的眞統一，建立中國的眞憲政，實現中國的眞民主。三十五年十一月二十四日</p>
<h3>民盟招待記者席上　一片鋒利質詢聲　當由羅隆基等分別答覆</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京廿四日電﹞民盟廿四日下午三時半，舉行記者招待會，報告民盟對國是態度，到各地在京記者百餘人，由民盟宣傳部長羅隆基主持，首宣讀書面談話，旋由記者提出問題，由羅隆基·張申府·章伯鈞分別作答，茲誌其重要者如次：</p>
<p>問：民盟今後對調停國共問題之具體方法如何？</p>
<p>答：民盟仍在努力恢復和談，停止內戰。至其辦法，則未能奉告。</p>
<p>問：民社黨參加國大，民盟對此持何種態度？</p>
<p>答：民盟有一調整黨派關係之規章，其主要者即構成民盟之每一單位，均不得單獨直接與政府辦理交涉。民社黨參加國大，乃違反章則，故民盟當依此處理。</p>
<p>問：民盟對憲法草案看法如何？</p>
<p>答：我們有兩種看法：（一）不是政協完成的憲法，不能承認，此乃少數人研究商討者，同時其中最主要一點，即政院向立院負責一點，並非政協決議之條文，而爲當時政府方面所提出者。另尚有若干部份，民盟則保留批評。</p>
<p>問：十一月十一日民盟·社會賢達·青年黨，在交行開會，決定上書蔣主席，請求國大延期至十二月一日舉行，並聲明凡署名者皆參加國大，事後張申府章伯鈞等，與共黨代表晤談后，臨時又將所簽之名挖去，是否事實？並與民盟超然之立場有無抵觸？</p>
<p>答：此函係用團體名義提出，由個人簽名，並聲明不參加不統一之國大，此信今存莫德惠處旣以個人資格簽名，個人不願意者，當然可以取消。當時張申府即　起立發言稱：國共問題不解決，則一切問題均不能解決，第三者方面每次提出方案，均攷慮是否能爲雙方所通過，如不能通過徒增調停之困難，而傷雙方之感情，當時予等發現上書國大延期一事，並不妥當，因此不得不臨時撤團。</p>
<p>問：民盟對張君勱與蔣主席交換函件，及張君勱個人不參加國大有何意見？</p>
<p>答：此事係民社黨內部事件，不願作何批評。</p>
<p>問：民盟所稱國大召開無法律上之根據，請問政協決議又有何法律根據？</p>
<p>答：政協決議不僅有法律根據且爲大憲草。政協決議既推翻，國大即無根據。</p>
<p>問：此次國大除國民黨·民社黨·青年黨·社會賢達代表參加外，尚有人民代表在內，所稱憲法應根據大眾民意，請問代表民意者，應重視國大，抑重視民盟意見？</p>
<p>答：所謂那一方代表民意多，並無根據，且任何一國制憲必須顧及各方面，若有部份人未參加制憲，即可不承認。</p>
<p>問：民盟既認爲國大不合法，對此作何表示？</p>
<p>答：民盟將不受此種憲法之約束。</p>
<p>問：如有流氓土匪少數人未參加制憲，渠等豈非亦不受此項憲法之約束，而國家大法即便不存在乎？（當時全場譁然，羅即作側面答覆）</p>
<p>答：余等在政協會議時，係與各黨派地位平等者，流氓土匪爲不合法者，當不能相提並論。</p>
<p>問：民社黨參加國大共計四十名，爲民盟代表名額之三分之一，然聞民社黨參加民盟者，僅二十餘人，不知如何支配？</p>
<p>答：此乃政府所給予者。招待會至四時許始畢，自始至終發問者極爲踴躍，且均激烈。羅於答問時，亦極感照顧不周，且由張申府·章伯鈞時予協助，始能終場。</p>
<h3>憲草即提交國大　王寵惠漏夜整理報告書　吳經熊談對訂正稿意見</h3>

<h3>國大花絮錄</h3>
<p>— 本報記者濮德玠</p>
<p>—首次大會前一日小景</p>
<p>接連兩日不開會，國民大會堂顯得不少冷清，一大　交運車排在大門對面的馬路邊上，難得有一輛開動，就是開動，裏面的乘客也寥寥無幾。而且都是職員，代表們有應酬的應酬，沒有應酬的也沒事作，太平路有代表在逛大街，買零用東西。</p>
<p>會堂區的汽車來往少了，來往的人少了，憲警同志也少了，每一個安閑的站在那裏晒太陽，偶爾擺擺手指揮一兩部汽車開進開出，偶爾和一兩個無處追新聞試着溜溜會場的記者打個招呼，看看　，還說一聲「對不起」，完全沒有開會時緊張的樣子，但明天如何，誰也說不起來。</p>
<p>會場裏每張座椅都空着，每　擴音器都戴上一頂紫紅布縫的帽子，場周的電燈亮着，天花板上的日光燈却開着，靜悄悄地，台上有匠人在收拾兩邊主席團辦公室和國府主席休息室的總門帘，明天開始　兩幅門帘就要忙碌不堪了。</p>
<p>二十四日是國大僅有的清閑日子。各部門的工作人員都得到一個休息機會，衣帽間的小姐們不知去向，議事組的小姐們在會堂內外拍照片，電話總機的値機小姐也坐在那兒用四川話擺龍門陣，大會秘書處二十五日成立，籌委會秘書處說是廿四日辦移交，但洪秘書長還是洪秘書長，實在沒移交可辦，廿五日奉新印行事就是。</p>
<p>有人說：「你們新聞記者最勢利眼，如今馬帥和司徒大使就是不離開南京，你們怕也不會找他們了，你看，梅園中共辦事處沒人去了，鳳頤村青年黨辦事處也沒人去了，今天又找到民盟了。」的確，廿四日只有民盟招待記者一件新聞是件大事，龍門酒家樓上第一號房間里，煙霧繚繞，人頭攢動，記者裏外全是，問題一個追一個，一個緊一個，好口才如羅隆基，也有照顧不了的樣子。</p>
<p>新聞記者大家沒事作，下午聽聽民盟宣言，　看民社黨報到，把民社代表諸公的姓名和面孔湊到一塊後，就一齊跑到六華春去。南京市記者公會設宴招待出席國大採訪的各地同業</p>
<p>國大自廿五日起，開始正式大會，由胡春冰主持之「國大日報」，亦定是日發刊。篇幅爲四開一張，分爲四版，其內容除大會公報消息外，將以各項參考資料爲主。又秘書處職員已自廿三日起加値夜班，輪流於晚六時至十時留處辦公。</p>
<p>記者公會的夜宴，開在六華春的大廳裏，一大塊紅緞子上，簽滿了名字，一大間食堂裏，坐滿了客人，談笑鼓掌，此起彼落，接着「五魁」「八仙」，到處拇戰，能吃酒的，一手端酒壺，一手拿酒杯，東征西討，小姐們也不能不吃，臉都紅紅的，洋朋友也「四季財」「全福壽」到散席時，大家仍然興高采烈，像是喝了誰的喜酒。六華春的老闆說：「今天人眞不少，這份熱鬧，還是勝利後頭一次看見。」（完）</p>

<h3>十位立委論修正憲草　（三）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　俞振基</p>
<p>總統制？新總統制？</p>
<p>立法院此次審議憲草時，最受各立委重視之條款，爲根據政協原則而擬定之第五十六條（中華　國憲草修正案第五十八條）行政院對立法院負責一問題。根據該條規定「立法院對於行政院之重要政策不贊同時，得以決議移請行政院變更之，行政院對於立法院之決議，得經總統之核可移請立法院覆議，覆讀時如經出席立法委員三分之二維持原決議，該決議行政院長應予接受或辭職。」憲草對行政院對於立院通過之法律案等亦有同樣之規定。此種條款實爲原憲草所無者。　王寵惠氏於立院審查會說明時稱：此點二中全會曾發生大疑問。外問對之亦多議論，其實此一規定，不必籠統稱之爲總統制或內閣制，蓋其並無不信任權，行政院對立法院亦無解散權，故與英法兩國內閣制相異。同時又有：「該決議行政院長應予接受或辭職」之規定，此爲採總統制之　臘所無者，亦爲優於總統制之處。又行政院長辭職後，總統可選一新政院院長以與法院磋商，如是可多一轉圖餘地，總統亦可不直接與立法院衝突。美國往往因總統與國會衝突政務因之延　，而新憲草有「立法委員三分之二維持原決議一項規定，彼此有磋商餘地。王氏並各此種制度爲新總統制。</p>
<p>五五憲草原起草人吳經熊則認此種制度仍爲總統制，惟同時具備內閣制之意味。因內閣制有兩種特點：（一）閣員由議員中產生，（二）議院對內閣有不信任權。新憲草即與之不同，蓋新制中行政院院長由總統提名，而立法院僅有同意權，與美國總統制相同。行政院對立院制定之憲法表示不滿，得經總統核可，送請立院覆議，立院如無三分之二之委員維持原議，即須加以修改，亦爲偏重總統制之證明。</p>
<p>大都份立委對此一規定表示滿意，如李慶　即認行政立法互相　制爲新憲軍之進步，蓋如是旣無總統之專橫，亦無黨會之專制。議會若時被解散，選舉實費周章，英倫彈丸小島，舉行一次普選尚須三個月時間，以中國幅員之大，選舉一次恐非三年不辦，實非事實所能許可。</p>
<p>鍾天心同意王寵惠之解釋，認新憲草爲一種新總統制。蓋第五十六條規定，在三種情形下（第一，第二，第三款）行政院始對立法院負責，如是僅爲有限度的負責而非如內閣制之一切皆負責。並指出原草案對行政院亦有種種限制，所不同者僅其一有時間限制，一無時間限制而已。鍾氏認新憲草中立法對行政政策有相當控制，鑒於同前立法院對行政院無法實施制衡作用，新規定實屬需要。至行政院長不接受立法院　議應辭職，此點原憲草亦有此意。</p>
<p>鍾氏並認，根據國情，我國並不適宜於實行內閣制，蓋實行此種制度須有一先天條件，即「盧君本位」，此爲我國所無者。內閣制在英國實行成功，在法國即告失敗，其故即在於此。再者，中國爲民主共和國，新總統將由人民普選，而同時又採行內閣制，實爲違反人情。</p>
<p>另一贊同者爲諶小岑氏。議氏認新憲草之規定爲由專制過渡到民主的一種辦法，民意機關對行政院無權，則何貴有權？惟法國時時倒閣亦足爲我人殷鑒。蓋我國今日之局勢實需要安定，政府存五日京兆之心，國家何由建立，新憲草有變通十規定，較爲進步。張肇元亦認新制爲進步，惟認不必稱其爲內閣制或總統制。　反對此種制度者有陳顧遠，陳長蘅等。陳顧遠認行政對立法負責將使政權與治權混淆，陳長蘅認每一法律之討論皆有發生爭議可能，執行五十六條恐有困難，至少「辭職」，不必規定於憲法之中。至負責一點，行政院直接向總統負責，間接向國火魚責，對立法負責似不好。渠認二三兩款可要，然「行政院長辭職」等字應删去。</p>
<p>同意權與五權理論</p>
<p>在「劑衡」理論上，另一曾引起軒然大波之問題爲同意權問題。盜一般咸認有同意權後，即爲破壞五權制度。憲草中除上述立法院對行政院之重要政策可作「不贊同」決議外，憲法涉及同意權者有第五十五條（中華民國憲草修正案第五十六條）「行政院院長由總統提名，經立法院同意任命之」；第八十二條（同上第八十三條）「司法院設院長一人，大法官若干人，由總統提名經監察院同意任命之；」第八十八條（同上八十九條）「考試院設考試委員若干人，由總統提名經監察院同意任命之；」第九十四條（同上第九十五條）「監察院爲國家最高監察機關，行使同意彈劾及監察權。」凡此皆爲根據政協決議而規定者。</p>
<p>解釋同意權最精　者爲鍾天心，鍾氏認立法院等有同意權後，即不能認爲行政權將受限制，因此而失去其獨立性，並進而認新制爲破壞五權制度之內閣制。鍾氏特別指出，在總統制度之下，亦何嘗不有同意權，如美國總統任命國務卿陸海軍部長，皆須徵得國會同意，即其例證，而我國之同憲權在程度上尚不能與美國相比。鍾氏以爲根據我國國情，採行同意權制度實有其必要，蓋我國任用私人觀念極深，政黨政治若發達，任用同黨人士之風必盛，有此後可加限制。</p>
<p>陳長蘅氏則作進一步之看法，認爲重要任命，至少院長及副院長，不應該由立法或監察任命即可，而應提經國大同意</p>
<p>中央與地方省與縣</p>
<p>政協對於中央與地方關係曾作四種規定：（一）確定省爲地方自治之最高單位，（二）省與中央權限之劃分，依照均權主義規定（三）省畏民選，（四）省得制定省憲（後改爲自治法），但不得與國憲抵觸，新憲草對上述決議咸已採納。</p>
<p>立委狄膺，前於立院發言時，對此點亦反對最烈，認此事實違背總理遣敎，蓋「縣爲自治單位，」實爲總理以此救中國之最重要主張，今將此條取消，勢將增加割據趨勢。陳顧遠認中央與地方權限分別列舉固佳，然省成自治單位後，易成割據局面。諶小岑則採折中看法，認我國歷史上地方權力大則形成分裂地方權力小則不民主，新憲草規定相當好，可以試辦。惟認縣爲自洽單位較爲合乎國情，有人建議縮小省區，或亦爲一種辦法。陳長蘅氏認省可制定自洽法，惟除不得與憲法抵觸外尚應加「不得與中央法令牴觸」一語。</p>
<p>張　元氏認爲將過去專作一承土啓下」工作之省改爲自治單位爲一種進步。省旣爲自治單位自應有自治法以便根據各省不同之政情，在不違背中央法令條件之下，適應當地情形。李慶　氏亦作同樣看法認各省情形不同，國策應由中央決定，因地制宜之事項，應儘量授權地方。原憲草對此過於疏漏，新憲草即較進步。關於「省長民選」一點，原憲法規定由中央任命，此係爲適應情勢，當不能永久如此。</p>
<p>最後尚有一點應聲明者：王　　等所擬之訂正稿對中央與地方共有之權利其規定如下：「左列事項由中央立法並執行，或交由省執行之」憲草審議會之最後修正本於省字下加一「縣」字，並於第一款加「省縣自治通則」，此爲一種較爲變通之辦法。（完）</p>

<p>國民大會於十五日開幕後，忽已一週，主席團的人選問題以及議事日程，均已在上一星期內決定，本日舉行首次大會，已自預備會議步人正式開議的階段。同時國民大會的基礎也日益擴大，社會賢連與靑年黨倡導於前，首先提出代表名單參加國民大會，而今又有民主社會黨代表四十人，於昨日午後報到，本日均將出席首决大會，使這次國民大會眞能成爲包容各種意見的議塲，實爲目前政局開朗最可喜的現象。這固然是由於民主社會黨領袖張君勱氏的賢明抉擇所致，但仍不能不歸功於政府大公無私的精神。中共對於國民大會的召開，始終抱着不妥協的態度，先則千方百計，阻撓國民大會的開慕；後則千方百計，破壞國民大會的制憲工作，但是在政府方面，一忍再忍，一讓再讓，甚至「忍至人所不能忍，讓至人所不能讓」的地步，迄今猶保留其代表名額，並將國民大會的大門　開，竭誠希望中共能幡然覺悟，參加國民大會的制憲工作。國民黨以一個在朝執政的政黨而有此「天下爲公」的大度，眞是中國政治走上民主法治的有力保證。</p>
<p>但是中共對於民主社‘會黨的參加國大，偏偏要說：「此爲民主社會黨帮助國民黨澈底破壞政協之粉飾而已」。接着又說：「民主社會黨參加國大之後，並沒有改變國大一黨包辦之本質」。中共發言人的信口雌簧，誰也不能置信，實無一辯的價値。中共企圖破壞國大的制憲工作，是昭然若揭的；這種作風的畏此不改，終有衆叛親離的一天。中共的執迷不悟，始終拒絕參加國火，實無異於自暴自棄，自絕於國人，我們實在替它可惜。中共不乏高明之士，何以一定要出此下策呢？實令人大惑不解。</p>
<p>民主社會黨的決定參加國大以及其領袖張君勱與蔣主席互相交換的件的發表，我們原以爲一定能感動民盟的其他領袖，而繼民社黨之後，參加國大的制憲工作的：但是昨天看了民盟發表的書而談話，闡明民盟對於國大的態度、其要點有二：（一）據護政協決議，堅持「國民火會要依據協議的步驟而召集，憲法要依據協議的草案而制定」的主張，故拒不參加國民大會。（二）反對內戰，而認爲「今天中國現實政治，必先求得國共雙方停止武力衝突，而後有和平；必先有了和平，而後才能有憲政與民主」故今後民盟的態度，仍保特超然獨立的地位。使我們不得不爲民盟惋惜。民盟素以第三方面的地位自居，且至今猶稱處於超然地位，何以甘心附和中共的主張，拒不參加國民大會，實在太令人失望了。所以我們還要請民盟領袖再三思之。</p>
<p>第一，民盟表示其堅守的兩個原則，一是挪護政協；二是反對內戰；我們看了民主社會黨領袖張君勱致　蔣主席一函，其大意也是如此，而且對於如何執行停戰命令以及如何實現政協決議，提出具體方案，以視民盟企求和平民主，尤爲迫切，但是民主社會黨經蔣主席覆函表示採納其主張之後，即提出代表四十人之名單，並已於昨日報到，自本日起正式出席國民大會。民盟何以不能參加？豈另有苦衷乎？</p>
<p>第二，民盟稱政協決議爲「大憲章」，而對於這次召開的國民大會，則認爲「達背了政協決議的整個精神，破壞了政協決議的程序，不是全國團結統一的制憲會議。」這種一味附和中共的論調，徒見民盟的態度未能超然，對於是非黑白，尚不能分別淸楚，實有失其立塲。政協決議在法理上不能視爲「　草」，是非常明顯的，因爲政治協商會議的性質，在當時我們就指出，這是解決黨爭的一種政治措施，僅使各方面互相交換意見，而取得一共同的結論而已。所以政協決議，根本談不到法律，更何論稱之爲「憲章」！但是各方面所以尊重政協決議，這是由於各方面所負的政治責任所致。蔣主席在國大開幕之前，固曾一再鄭重表示，政府決計遵守政協決議，務使其實現。在國民大會開幕之後，依照政協決議而擬就的五五憲草修正案草案，也經立法院通過了；同時國民黨的中常會與國防最商委員會，最近又通過了國府組織法與行政院組織法的修正案，充分表現出遵守政協決議的精神。</p>
<p>第三，一抓彼此尊重與兀相容　的新政風，已山國民火會的召開而將造成，尤其是政府當局，到處表現出盡其在我的　神，所謂「爲政不在多言」口口聲聲，高呼和平民主等口號的政黨，往往不是眞正愛好和平民主的政黨；中共處處以政協決議相標榜，但是按之實際，都不過是「空口說白話」而已，目下眞正遵守政協決議的，還是政府。請看下列幾項事實。（二）政府也知道「必先有了和平，而後才能有憲政」，在國民大會開幕之前，早就自動的無條件的頒發停戰命令，如果中共能以國家爲重，也能眞正企求和平民主，國內的衝突，立即就可以停止，所以戰亂的不能停止。這個賣任應歸何方？不言可知。（二）政府亟欲召開國民大會，並不是握了政權不肯放手，而是想早日結束訓政，把政權還諸於人民。同時，中國民大會制定一部切實可行的民主憲法之後，即可步入憲政的常軌。任何方面對』於政府這種用意，絕無反對的理由（三）這次國民大會的唯一的任務，乃在制定一部切實可行的民主憲法，五五憲草，因爲時間的久隔，不免有不合時宜的地方，因此立法院又依照了政協決議的精神，通過了一種憲草修正案，不論從那一個角度去觀察，政府的措置，不僅充分表現遵守政協決議的精神，而且也表現出政府求進步的朝氣。（四）政府在國民大會開會期間，又自動進行改組國府及行政院的工作，中常會與國防委員會所通過的國府與行政院組織法的修正案，也是根據政協決議，一俟國民大會閉幕，改組政府即可完全實現。</p>
<p>要之，民主社會黨旣爲構成民主同盟的一份子，論理其主張也就是民盟的主張；而且在事實上，看了張君勱氏致蔣主席一函與民盟昨日所發表之書面聲明，也就不難明瞭，民社黨與民盟的見解完全一致的。民盟代表一百二十人中，已有四十人參加國大其餘八十人爲何仍拒不參加呢？民盟旣反對政黨在戰塲上解決問題，就該參加這一個包容各種意見的議塲，將各種不同的良好意見，融會貫通，折衷至當，以求得各種問題的合理解決。這是使中國政治走上民主和平唯一的康莊大道。</p>
<h3>美國煤礦的工潮</h3>
<p>美國煤礦工人最近因要求拋高待遇，未得完全採納，實行罷工。昨據聯合計社華盛頓二十二日消息，礦工聯合會主席魯易斯態度仍極堅定，決心爲合法的罷工奮鬥。法庭已發出傳票，假如魯易斯於二十五日以前，命令礦工復工，可免懲罰，否則將於二十七日晨受審。同時政府各部門均採取緊急措施，停止貨運，實行節電。民用生產管理委員史馬爾發出警告，謂煤斤缺乏，將摧殘全國經濟。一般情勢的嚴重，可以想見。</p>
<p>美國是世界最高度工業化的國家，煤是推動一切工業的力量，是人民生活一日不可缺少的必需品。這次四十萬煤礦工人的罷工，對於全國的經濟生活，當然是一個最大的打擊。並且煤礦工會是其它工會的鎭鑰，煤礦工人工資的增加，往往領導其他工人同樣的要求。美國政府不敢輕易答應，就是恐怕欽成全國工業的擾亂。其實煤礦工人要求每日加兩元的工資，和其它待遇的改善，條件也並不算過於苛刻。不過罷工的風氣一開，政府每次屈服，將來更無力控制。自從本年五月以還。美國聯邦政府就是因爲煤礦工人罷工太多，影響全國經濟，改由內政部直接管理。假如這次工潮不能平息，將證明聯邦政府的無能。</p>
<p>照目前的情勢，雙方各走極端。政府決心採用壓迫的政策，工會決心爭取控制的權力。法庭對於魯易斯的威脅，大概不會發生多大的效果。因爲個人方面的犧牲，魯易斯身爲工會的領袖，決不會恐懼的。而且自從共和黨選舉勝利，杜魯門總統取消物價管制，工人　给不够維持物價上漲後的生活，也是實情。如果政府一意孤行，專事壓迫，不從根本方面，改着工人的生活，恐怕更要發生不良的影響。至於工人方面，不顧全國國民的經濟生活，動輒罷工，擴持日久，也要遭受全國國民的指　。只有雙方讓步，總可以平息這一塲風波。</p>
<p>至於從國際方面來說，這次工潮不及早解決，全世界都要遭受禍災。第二次大戰後，美國是唯一的國家，工業設備，完美無缺，沒有受戰爭的摧毀。美國不但能够產生足够本國國民生活的成品和物資，而且有當餘來救濟全世界的炎民，帮助各國逐漸恢復戰前的經濟生活。對聯合救濟總署，美國貢獻了二十七萬萬美元，對各國的貸款至今已達一百五十萬萬美元。這些　大捐獻和貸出的美元，實際上不是鈔票，乃是美國富餘的物資。假如美國本國的工業，遭受摧殘，全世界將得不着救濟，已貸和將貸的款項也等於廢紙。</p>
<p>現在世界的經濟是互相依賴的。美國參議員湯姆斯認爲只有世界各國經濟繁榮，美國的經濟總能够繁榮。反過來說，美國的經濟遭受打擊，全世界的經濟也要遭受打擊。此次工潮的影響是最明顯的，因爲一旦美國燃荒，美國的成品和物資立刻不能大量出口，甚至善後教濟也成問題。</p>
<p>並且自從戰爭結束，全世界都鬧煤荒。即如德國魯爾區戰前每年除自用外可輸出三千一百萬噸到外國，今年只能輸出一千三百萬噸。蘇聯的產煤不過戰前的百分之五十，當然沒有輸出。全歐洲需煤三萬八千五百萬噸，自身只能產百分之七十二，美國和英國的輸入僅佔百分之六，尚差百分之二十二。但是美國　到歐洲的煤二千二百萬噸已經代表美國全部生產的百分之五，在戰前美國對歐洲只輸出百分之三，歐洲方面，還切望美國提高生產，大量輸出，來救濟歐洲的煤荒。</p>
<p>從各方面來看，美國這一次煤礦工人罷工，意義是很嚴重的，假如這一次處理不善，再醞釀繼續多次的罷工，嚴重的威脅依然不能解除。我們希望美國政府當局和美國礦工聯合會主席魯易斯從大處着想，不要堅持私見。</p>

<p>復嚴錦文君：來函痛陳病孩醫死，悲憤之情，溢於言表，殊堪同情。惟此事關係醫院信譽甚大，當將來函轉去紅十字會第一醫院，質詢究　有無疏誤之處。頃據該院覆函聲稱：﹝本月十四日上午一時許，有嚴錦文者，抱一甫生一月餘而奄奄一息之女性嬰孩投院求治。當即經小兒科值日之醫師予以診察，據該病孩家長口述：「該孩之母懷孕八閱月有半，該孩即已出生，即不足月之早產；患病已半月有餘，腹部膨脹，並時常嘔吐及啼哭，因習於迷信，未送醫院，茲因病勢已危，故抱來請爲挽救」云云。嗣即經劉醫師診察得該女孩身軀瘦小，顯係先天不足，臍部發炎，致成腹膜炎症，遂致引起腹部膨脹如鼓。且臍部自臍帶落後，從未收口，診察時且有液體流出，臍部之靜脈管異常顯明，指示病期已久。當時因病孩病情嚴重，氣奄一息，即先囑護士用咖啡安息酸鈉作皮下注射，注射後竟不治而死。（按咖啡安息酸鈉爲強心劑中藥性中和而穩妥之藥劑，決無毒性致命之處，可引證藥典，並質諸藥學及醫學專家之公評。）該家長嚴錦文即疑爲打針致死，旋奪取針藥瓶，不問情由，委屍出走。醫師見其動作反常，恐其將針藥瓶持去，一無憑證，請其出具收據，書明咖啡安息酸鈉之空瓶字樣，又或請其親自包裹加封簽名，封誌存留以爲佐證，均經遭其拒絕。本院事務處值日員喻君，見其無理可喻，遂按情報告本管靜安寺區警局（報警局由本院主動，靜安寺區警局有案可稽），請其派員到院調查真相。旋即於十五日由法院檢察官偕同法警依法作屍體解剖之檢騐，斷係病死，並責成該孩屍之家長自行領回斂埋。此爲當時之經過實情也。﹞據此，似該孩虛弱已極，醫藥罔效之故。爲安慰台端計，台端惟有勉抑哀痛耳。特復。</p>
<h3>祥德路將恢復光明</h3>
<p>本報讀者歐陽文君來函陳述祥德路需要光明一則，頃得公用局復稱：「歐陽君關心公益，良用感佩，查該處原有路燈，係敵偽時代所裝，不合式樣，且已破舊不堪，故會飭田本局滬北路燈管理所派工拆除，另籌換裝新燈架，現訂製之燈架已交貨，該處路燈本月底前即可恢復放光。」請該路住戶靜俟放光。</p>
<h3>機轉日曆之應聲</h3>
<p>昨閱貴報見「永嘉青年陳偉發明機轉日曆」新聞一則，敝人不才，於本年四月間，亦曾造就陽曆星期變換曆一，若使曆法不更變，此換算曆亦可用之萬年，且異常輕便，以二直徑六厘米（約二吋半）之盤轉動而換算。不知陳偉先生之日曆係純爲陽曆換算曆，抑爲陰陽曆變換曆，乞陳偉先生賜答爲幸。　（湯良瑾）</p>

<h3>憲草修正案審查前後之比較</h3>
<p>本報資料室</p>
<p>中華民國憲法草案修正案，已經立法院全體會議通過，即可望　國民大會復決了。</p>
<p>憲法經中常會及立法院五委員會聯席會議審查之結果，和原修正案大致相同，但有數處略有更改。如修正案僅一百四十八條者，今已增爲一百五十一條。如四十五條，第五十七條，第九十二條，第九十九條，及第一百〇四條，均爲原修正草案所無，而於審查時新增者。原修正草案中第六十二條及九十一條均被刪去，其他尚有文字修正者，地位前後更易之。</p>
<p>關於新增之各條，第四十五條爲：「總統對於院與院間之爭執，除本憲法已有規定者外，得召集有關各院院長會商解決之。」政府之組織，均有相連之關係，尤其如立法院與行政院之間，關係更密，如第五十八條之規定是。惟憲法爲一國之根本大法，僅爲綱領，而國家政局之幻變，非憲法所能全部包含者，這一條新條文之增加，實爲補第五十八條不足之處。</p>
<p>新增之第五十七條，爲行政院各部會首長任命之規定。原修正案僅有行政院院長任命之規定，而對於各部會首長則討闕如。行政本爲推行各項事業之機構，而於院長之外，各部會首長爲實際推行政令之人，亦須得規定於憲法之內。同時各部會首長爲行政院院長之左右手，由行政院院長提出，更可收指臂之助。</p>
<p>第九十二條所增者，其原文爲：「考試院關於所　事項，提出法律案時，由考試院秘書長出席立法院說明之。」立法本立法院之工作，但關於考試任用銓敘等法規，立法院有時不知其用意之所在，若考試院能加以說明，則所產生之新法規，可以更切實用。</p>
<p>第九十九條爲：「監察院依本憲法之規定，行使同意權時，由全院會議過半數之決議行之。」監察院之組織，爲委員制，則通過決議案之人數，必須明文規定。除一百〇三條及一百〇五條之規定外，再以本條補充之，使更爲完整。</p>
<p>原修正草案中，監察院之職權，僅對於中央及地方行政人員之彈劾。但司法人員與考試人員，亦可能有違法失職之處，惟可視行政人員同例處理，然今加以明文規定，更爲明顯而準確。</p>
<p>至於被刪去之兩條，原修正草案第六十二條之內容，與審查後第五十八條第一款之性質相同，自可刪去，以免重複。原文被刪去之第九十一條爲考試委員之任期，考試委員乃由總統題名，經監察院同意而任命之，與直接由人民選出之立法委員與監察委員不同。既非由選舉而產生，自可不必規定任期。</p>
<p>以上均係全文增减者，此外尚有修改一部份者。其中重要者如第一百四十三條，關於教育之宗旨，除原有三項外，增加「國民道德」及「健全體格」二項。夫道德本爲我國過去立國之根本，昔日儒家教育，均以培養道德爲主，今後之教育亦必須注意及此。健全體格在我國情形看來，亦宜例入之必要，庶可一洗東亞病夫之　，而能負担今後重大的建國責任。</p>
<p>第一百四十七條關於法律與憲法抵觸時，由司法院解釋之，原規定「由行政院於該法律施行後六個月提出」數字，已爲刪去。蓋法律與憲法有所抵觸之疑義，隨時可以發生，並非必在半年之內。若硬性規定，而遇於半年後　生抵觸之疑義時，將如之何。今所規定之期限已經刪去，則以後可隨時請司法院解釋疑義。</p>
<p>第五條及第十一條，均有一段文字刪去。第五條正文爲：「中華民國各民族一律平等」。已可以包括一切，後面一段文字，本不過爲前段之註釋，但似覺有不明顯之矛盾，自以刪去爲宜。第十一條被刪去之文字爲：「政府機關或軍隊不得強佔民房」。強佔民房，即是妨礙人民居住之自由。人民既有居住及遷徙之自由，自不必再加以說明之必要。</p>
<p>第一百〇五條關於監察院對於總統之彈劾，所提出之監察委員，從十人增之四分之一。對於總統之彈劾，爲非常重大之事，監委十人提出，如覺力弱，今改爲四分之一。雖表面上增加監委的人數，實際上爲重視監委的職權。</p>
<p>以上各項，均爲修改之重要者。其他將「民族自治區域」改爲「蒙古各盟及西藏」。原第六十七，六十八條移後，改爲七十八，七十九條，此均無關宏旨，不另論之。（完）</p>

<h3>五强會議造成分裂局面　蘇堅拒限制否決權　全案將返還聯大會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報紐約特派員廿四日專電〕五强昨在華爾道夫，阿斯多麗亞旅館舉行會議時，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫拒絕西方盟國所提在安理會中限制否決權之建議。莫氏之堅決態度將使各小國要求修改聯合國表決規程之未來企圖，必吿失敗，同時限制使用否決權之運動將吿終止。國務卿貝爾納斯及英外相員文主張成立一項協定，對於較小事件取消使用否決權。貝文主張安理會在將可能牽涉否決權之問題付表決以前，應先竭力設法，俾成立協議。中國代表顧維鈞及法代表巴洛迪均附議貝文主張。但莫洛托夫堅持其原來支塲，要求大會對於限制否決權之一切建議不予接受。此時具文乃起立稱：此事縱繼續討論，亦屬徒然，會議遂吿終止。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿三日電〕五强代表今日秘寗會議，討論很制使用否決權，經兩小時之辯論，蘇外長莫洛托夫已率直拒絕美英中法四國所作努力，造成五張分裂之局，並將全案返還聯合國大會。據參加會議之西方外交家傳出，莫洛托夫與其他四强代表意見衝突。會議開始時，莫氏即請其他代表通過議案，聲明反對限制聯合國憲章規定之否決權，並反對以拘泥之形式加於聯合國機構，主張設決促進聯合國間之協調。莫氏建議將此項犧案提交聯合國大會通過，據稱，關於安理會之表決制度，衆議紛紜，大會應即採取確定行動，加以擁護，英外相貝文。美國務卿貝爾納斯，中國代表顧維鈞與法國代表巴洛迪皆認爲莫氏之議案不能接受。但觀莫氏提議案之措辭，及其堅決要求大會採取行動，無疑於大會討論此問題時，蘇聯將以最堅强之　句，要求拒絕關於否決權之一切批評。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿四日廣播：今日星期日，聯大全會及外長會議均停開，但中英美法四國代表則非正式舉行會談，討論如何應付蘇聯拒絕接受否決權修正案所引起之局勢，此種塲外活動値得重視。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕太平洋受戰爭損失各國，渴望以日本之工業賠償作爲復興物資之來源。美國正繼續努力，使日本賠償問題於十二月初加以討論，獲得解決方法，並付諸實施。要求賠償各國現正作賠償之初步佔計，但困難問題層出不窮。新的困難問題有二：（一）在申請賠償國境內之日本資產是否列入對各國共同賠價總目之內？（二）中國東九省境內荶聯所搬走之日本舊有財產如何算法？現悉中爾及菲律賓認爲此項財產不應併入總賠償項目內，應屬於財產所在國家，同時日本土之財產，則應撥出以滿足各該國之賠償要求。此種態度與美國火有出入，美國堅主日本所有資產，不論在何國，均應列入總賠償項目以內。中國代表在遠重委員會中說明中國之立塲稱：「中國對於日本一切事物，凡足以補償吾人戰爭損失者，均表關注，因吾人在參加太平洋戰爭各國巾，受害最重；吾人要求自日本獲得之資產種種，較他國爲多。吾人亟欲取得對吾人有價値之任何事物。中眞對日本並無恫嚇或報復之念，但求對自身公正而已。」開中菲等國準備向日本開列戰爭　單，包括日本工業資產，如船塢，旱船塢，水泥廠，造紙廠，開礦設備，展銅廠，電力廠，椰子油廠，漁船，木材廠設備，木工機　，紡織廠等·聞菲律賓希望至少獲得價値十萬萬美元之日本資產；但美國將主張日本保有適當之工業與資產，以維持其經濟生活。同時主張朝鮮境內之日本資產，　持不動。</p>

<h3>杜魯門返京會議　高計煤礦工潮應付辦法　政府主張全國厲行煤斤配給</h3>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿三日電〕美政府高級官員預料：美國煤礦工潮將影響西歐之政局，被等雖吾認美國係以燃料及糧食作爲政治武器，但亦承認此兩種物品爲今日歐洲重要之政治問題。美國若不能履行其反潑饉之計劃，對外關係必受其損。</p>

<h3>印政局日趨嚴重</h3>
<p>尼赫魯要求懲戒英印官員</p>
<p>〔路透社印度聯合省梅魯特廿三日電〕印度臨時政府副總統尼赫魯今日在國大黨會議致辭，要求處罰一九四二年事件中之英印官員，（當時國大黨領袖發動英軍退出印度運動，尼赫魯等多人悉被囚於獄）　透露印督魏菲爾一度曾向其建議勿壓制官員，渠答以並無壓迫官員之意，但亦決不與一九四二年案中有過失之官員妥協，固不論其爲英人或印人也。尼氏復謂：英人在印雖高唱退出印度，而實則陰謀破壞印度之訂劃；然印度之敵人　不止英人一種，印人內部亦有敵人，在印度之解放　鬥中，必須消滅此等敵人，並剷除腐敗份子。國大黨另一領袖巴台爾則呼籲停止暴動，以免有傷國家元氣及印度之聲譽。渠謂：若使用和平與仁愛之方法始可成功，若使用暴力，必將遭遇暴力。回印分治計劃决不能憑武力實行否則印度必永遠不能有和平。</p>
<p>〔中央社印度密魯特廿三日專電〕自尼赫魯透露印臨時政府與圓納聲明尙有衝突後，印度政局日漸緊張。按眞納聲明於上星期四回盟份子拒絕參加制憲議會時發表，政局嚴重似已違頂點。國在任何情形下，吾人均不欲退出印度政府」設國大黨要求英人離印之決議付諸實現，則印人必須學習自衛。</p>

<h3>從美貨攤販　到聯合商塲　麻雀雖小五臟俱全　購買力薄弱影響生意清淡</h3>
<p>（本報特寫）「美貨攤販」和「聯合商塲」。名　不同　　　無異。因爲商塲的組成者，就是被取締的攤販，他們僅是，由「單獨作戰」發展到「集體合作」而已。「聯合商塲」實在是「時代的產兒」，它產生的背景是：（一）時局不安定，百業不景氣，失業者多，不得不走謀生最簡捷的途徑。（二）本市走私猖獗，美軍出售的剩餘物資允多，而一般市民，對於「美式配備」極爲信任，於是爲了推銷這些美貨，「攤販」和「商塲」應運而生，不管組織和形式如何，一樣的能够達到目的。（三）工商業着條，而工價生活費用奇高，此時此刻，小資本根本不敢開店，勉强開出亦是慢性的自殺；與其如此，不如在「聯合商塲」中，租下「三十二吋」的玫璃檯子面，自己兼做老闆和伙計，進可以攻，退可以守，反而來得穩健安全。這是一聯合商塲」產生的時代背景。同時這種情形不啻是一面鏡子，它照出了我們經濟發展之畸形，照出了整個社會的危機。</p>
<p>風起雲湧市場紛起</p>
<p>「聯合商塲」發展得很迅速，它的誕生是在九月初市府嚴厲取締攤販之後，但是爲時無幾，到今日上海已有三十家以上的聯合商場了。記者昨天便過中正東路，走進一家「聯合商塲」，和一個店伙閒談了幾分鐘。他坦白的說：過去是一個難販，現在是聯合商塲的一份子，商塲組織的緣起是如此：美貨攤販取締後，有商業眼光的人就看出商塲的必然性，於是一位「發起人」就以巨資把一家酒吧頂下，成爲今日的場址。凡是進出營來的難阪、每人出頂費八十五萬元，月租六萬元的代價，租下了三十二時玻璃　台的面積，不過，羅台是要自備的。租期訂定是三年，不過他們希望將來能有租賃優先權，不顧到期時被遂出境，現在正預備和「總　理處」交涉。這家商塲是由一百〇九個　阪單位組織成功的，貨物品目繁多，衣服有美式大衣，雨衣，竿毛衫，羊毛背心，軍毯，　子，……等，食的花樣更多，從纏頭食品，餅乾，咖啡，可可各式糖果……無美不備。日用品牙刷膏化粧品等應有盡有，「麻雀雖小五織俱全」，簡直是一個大百貨公司的縮影。同時，我們的邦一世紀來，是以商業起家的，羅斯福總統說得好：一商業是自由社會的血液　　他們對於商品的　　，　是美觀悅目特有心得，在乳白色燈光之下，更增加了吸引力。而且價目確比公司來得便宜，母怪一般購買力薄弱的小市民，大批的去做顧客了。不過，物以稀爲貴，現在聯合商場開得太快太多，因此影響了營業。有一個賣藥品的同我說：生意很差，有時得在外奔走，將賣不出的藥品，賣與同業，每天賺上二萬元，以維持起碼的生活。</p>
<p>大公司唯一的勁敵</p>
<p>記得九月一日市府決定取締美貨攤販的原因，主要是兩點：一是替走私物品和碼頭贓物做了出路，當時吳市長曾說過：碼頭倉庫上被偸之物，不到三日便在溪口路貨攤上出售了。二是「各攤貨品範圍甚廣，其資本且有達數千萬元者，規模雖無異商店，而納稅義務，則藉此逃避，對於正當商業，頗多影響。」在外匯匯率調整後，市府要求公司不抬價，公司方面亦一再要求取締攤販。於是攤販被取締了，大公司的威脅算是消除了。可是曾幾何時，這些攤販又以「聯合商塲」的姿態出現，一樣的成爲頭痛的問題。何以大百貨公司怕這些因陋就簡的小商塲？答案是容易獲得的。首先，後者的開支小，成本輕，他們的伙計就是老闆，或是老閶的家人，成本既輕，售價可低。反之，在大公司中職員數百人的薪水，就要算在開支項下，沒有相當的利憑，是不能維持的。第二點要從顧客的心理上去分析。在商塲中，他們歡迎你翻看貨物，耐心的陪着笑臉等你買，不買他也無所謂，因爲他們那些半舊的美軍剩餘物資，頂體面的人士是不賞光的，二則攤販終有一些自卑心理存在。但在大公司中，看貨不買，不好意思，而公司職員的態度和體貌，亦離關美國商業心理所要求的標準很遠。最主要的一點理由，是幣値跌落，市民購買力薄弱，美貨商塲東西便，易於招徠顧客。</p>
<p>現在，市府對於「聯合商塲」已大加注意了。認爲這些「商塲既非公司組織，又非合夥性質，大多由場主出資租屋，路加裝修，甚至僅以木架布蓬搆成，以致設櫃過多，走道狹小，一且發生火警，不堪設想。且漏稅貨物竊盜贓物，難免不向此求售。」現已由社會局和　　局擬就上海市百貨商場管理規　，原則已在市政會議通過，不日公布實施。已成立的商塲須限期申請登記，此後再有設立的，專先要經社會局核准。商塲應依法繳納捐稅，否則予以停業處分。未領建築執照而擅自建築商塲，亦在取給之列。出售物品不准遠反衛生法令，及出售不良藥物。各商場如發現私貨，立予停業處分。同時，商塲的帳册簿據，應隨時備查。因此，今後的美貨商塲，將受嚴格的管理，已開設的可能停業，增設更談不到。甚至這些辦法，可能是取締的先聲！</p>
<h3>美貨充斥市面　取之不盡！　用之不竭！</h3>
<p>分析美貨商塲的組成分子，裏面確有幾個有財力的人，但大部份是無業可就的貧民。從美貨攤販變到美貨商塲，都是爲了維持生計。他們無力走私，走私者是有力的人們，他們的貨物是洋行中批來或轉手買來的。上海現有的美貨太多了，即使以後沒有補充，在一個相當時間裏還銷不完。一個公平的人士，對於這些賣走私美貨的小販，不會過於同情，但承認他們求生的事實。對於正當的管理，將是衷心的贊同，而認爲如果不能使這批人轉業於有用之途，管理，合理而嚴格的管理是唯一可以採用的辦法。整個國家和社會是在一個「轉變期」內，畸形的現象甚多，美貨商塲僅是其中之一，而且是個很小的。</p>

<h3>上海的救濟工作</h3>
<p>— 本報特稿</p>
<p>衰老的秋光，給　風的西北風吹逝了。許多無吿的窮人，裏着破棉絮，在寒風褒瑟瑟戰慄，凍斃的屍體，即將在街頭發現。這是大都市中另一角度的鏡頭，誰說上海仍是天堂呢！「恤貧」是我國數千年來相傳的一糧美德，冬令救濟是目前一個應時的名詞，市政府在財政極度困難之下，也成立了冬令救濟委員會來辦理道一年一度的社會救濟工作，這是上海貧苦者的福音，希望工作能早些展開，貧民能平一天得到救濟。</p>
<p>上海究竟是個大都會，不僅慈善機關的數量比別處多，即所做工作也較有成續。本來辦慈善事業最需要的是錢，上海的富商巨買，稍爲節省一點烟酒應酬之費，數量已很可觀，事業也就容易辦了</p>
<p>「善門難開」原只是一句口頭禪，可是現在辦慈善事業的人，確有這種感覺。在物價高漲下，慈善機關都覺得經濟窘迫，捐款雖源源而來，但總不能扺補高物價的壓迫，賬而上龐大的赤字，無法彌補，不得不將一部份的事業停止。但看到許多歌台舞榭，茶肆酒樓中，一擲甲金而無吝色。則又望上海有錢的人，節省一點，來救救這貧苦無吿的同胞。</p>
<h3>歷史悠久的　仁濟堂</h3>
<p>在雲南路靠近愛多亞路的地方，有一所高大的廟宇式古屋，矗立在許多商店的陣綫中，這就是衣上海辦了六十四年慈善事業的機關——仁濟善堂。</p>
<p>仁濟堂現在已名聞全滬了，所辦的施醫，施藥，育嬰，恤嫠，施衣，施米等救濟工作，數十年來，不輟不懈，着實嘉惠了許多貧民。這所古老的慈善機關，由「文明局」而「中和局」，而「仁濟堂」，六十餘年來經歷了許多困難，可是主持的人一本「己飢己溺」的精神，爲貧民謀養生送死之事，這是値得欽佩的。</p>
<p>在六十四年前，南京路虹廟附近，出現了一座「文叫局」，他就是仁善堂的前身。文明局所辦的社會公益事業，主要的是敬惜字紙，開設義墊，和向民衆宣傳的勸善運動，此外也致力於恤貧恤嫠等慈善事業。大體說來，尙無愧於「文明局」三字。當時上海的慈善事業，還是在原始狀態中，靠個別善士的善言善行去辦理說不上組織，更談不到事業。但文明局的成立，却予上海社會以相當的刺激。</p>

<p>成立以後，因適社會上的實際需要，事業日見增加，範圍亦漸漸擴大。不久從南京路遷到北海路，改名爲中和局。這時中和局不僅得到廣大民衆的感戴，而且也得到許多樂善好施的人士的信任，捐助的金額，日高一日。這時開辦了施診給藥的慈善事業，實予當時貧民以最大的援助。</p>
<p>中和局</p>
<p>主持者得到各界鼓勵後，更提高了他們爲社會而服務的信念，希望能把這神聖工作，永遠地維持下去。於是購進了今日雲南路的土地作爲永久基礎，同時又擴充事業的範圍，名稱也由中和局而改名爲仁濟堂。這是光緒九年的事，那時由施善昌先生主其事，同時太守賈雨皋世出了不少的力。政府和人民併力舉辦然事善業，是値得紀念的，永遠將留爲佳話。</p>
<p>當我們踏進這所舊建築物，見到那些匾額，不禁令人發思古之幽情。那裏還有兪曲園所題「仁濟堂」三字的橫區掛着，供人欣賞。</p>
<p>施診給藥</p>
<p>是仁濟堂的主要工作。每天上午，擠滿了候診和領藥的人。南北兩大廳即各科診療室，旁邊乃給藥的地方。每位醫生都細心地詢問徵象，診斷病源，謹愼處方。他們不憚煩瑣地指導着病人像慈母之敎其子女，決沒有名醫的大架子，也沒有大醫院裏所見的聲色俱厲的面孔。「仁心仁術」四字，他們很可當得起。</p>
<p>給藥處像一家普通國藥號，辦事員以敏捷的動作，小心地工作着。每天從這裏配出的藥，總有數千劑，藥費的負担，也是一個很可觀的數目，都是由他們奔走勸募而來的。他們有三項目標：（一）藥材選擇，務求道地，（二）配合調製，必須謹愼，（三）按方配藥，不疏漏，不錯誤。他們依了這三項目際而在努力。</p>
<h3>一年一度　貧民庇寒所</h3>
<p>這一年一度的庇寒所，是冬令救濟的應時景物。日來西北風是一陣緊一陣了，街頭的窮人，受到嚴寒的威脅，庇寒所已在加緊籌備了。</p>
<p>戰前，南火車站附近的潮州會館，每年都爲庇寒所所借用。那裏的大廳二廳，和左邊的土地堂，可容納七八百人，圍牆內的空地，搭了竹棚，也可住二百餘人。一共能收一千多人，可是人多的時候，還不能盡量收容，有時須再借用其他公共塲所，作爲分所。</p>
<p>貪生的慘笑</p>
<p>這座佔地十餘畝的院子，圍着紅磚砌成的牆垣，即是安頓這千餘個無家可歸的貧民，度過冰天雪地的隆冬生活的所在。推開沉重的大鐵門，靠右邊設着一只長方櫃台，上面坐着辦事員，手不停揮地寫着，這是貧民登記處。一大羣鳩形鵠面，披着破絮殘縷的貧民，胸挨着背地擠着，黑黝黝地，排成了一條長蛇陣。他們沿着櫃台站着，一個個申報他自己的姓名，年齡，籍貫，職業，……這樣入所的手續，便算完成，從此他們的食宿，就由所裏負担了。看他們的臉上，都隱約地浮上了一層貪生的慘笑。</p>
<p>大　兩面舖上木板，墊着金黃色的稻草，只有中間留出一條走路，此即貧民的臥室。臥時，兩人合蓋一條棉被，白天都像泥佛似的蹲在板舖上，談天說地，有在捉蝨子的，也有在看小說的，更有兩人對坐着下棋的。面黃肌瘦的小孩子們，也都很天眞地在那裏玩耍。</p>
<p>每天二粥一飯</p>
<p>貧民的吃，每天二粥一飯，有時改爲三餐粥，還有一點鹹菜或蘿蔔佐飯。食時每十二人爲一班，另有一個班長負督率之責。班長即在貧民中選拔出來的，因爲他們的品行和敎育程度都比較的高，才給他們一個班長的名義，等到解散時，再揀那服務勸愼的人，加以獎勵。</p>
<p>庇寒所中沒有衛生設備，但對於貪民的健康，也很注意。貧民登紀入所後，先要剿頭沐浴，掉換衣褲，每人各得一套新製的棉衣褲。平時規定每月沐浴四次，理髮兩次。要是有人患病，即送人病房中，那裏另有看護班長負責。隨時由看護班長陪往新普育堂或上海醫院診治。</p>
<p>庇寒所每年大的有三四個月的時期，到天時溫暖，即給資遺散。露宿在街頭的貧民，可以好好地度過隆冬，意義是很好的。但終究是臨時性質，庇寒所結束後，這千餘個被遺散的貧民，又將如何生活？若能在收容的時候，給以相當工作，養成此後謀生的技能，則對於社會，便不無小補。</p>
<h3>白髪老人的天國</h3>
<p>「養兒防老，積穀防荒。」焭獨無靠的老人家是够可憐的。既不得安享幕景，以樂餘年，更沒有孝子順孫們來晨昏定省。但在南市的安老院中看來，許多老人家都是無憂無慮地在談笑，絕不知老病是人間的苦境，尤其是女修士姆姆們，體貼入微的侍奉，仁愛的笑容，永遠的掛在臉上，這親切的情景，誰家有如此的孝女賢媳呢！</p>
<p>安老院在南市外馬路機廠街，從崎嶇的市街，走進緋紅色的邊門，已是另一個世界了。這裏住着三百五十多個老人，有男的，有女的，有中國人，也有外國人，最大的已有八九十歲，最小的是六十歲，據說曾有過幾個一百多歲的。他們閃着似銀的白髮，襯托着紅潤的顏面，顯出是很健康的。這裏有廣大花園，寂靜中見到活潑，老人們能在道裏度其晚年，眞是無窮的幸福，誰不說是人間的天堂呢。</p>
<p>老人衣食·勸募得來</p>
<p>老人的衣食都是從外面勸募而來。因爲經費困難，他們在抗戰後已改爲二粥一飯了。在樓下有膳堂四大間，很是寬暢，每人有自己專用的餐具，分別裝在大抽屜裏，接着是一間很大的廚房，有中西合壁的烹飪設備，洗刷得雪亮的鍋子，運送飯菜的鐵車，實在和大餐館中的廚房。一式無一。有二三位女修士經常向外界勸募，菜塲大飯店，總會等，是她們張羅食品的主要地方整箱的餅乾，整只的鷄鴨，洋商伙食店中的罐頭食物，以及魚肉蔬菜，都有樂善者在佈施。烹調之後，香味四溢，老人們每天所吃，有葷有素，口福着實不淺。</p>
<p>老人們的衣服，也都是由各界勸募而來的廉貨，經消毒改裝後，分給他們穿着。也有從綢布店或服裝店電所募得的零星布料，經姆姆們細心補綴，集腋成表，縫成各色錦衣錦被，既美觀，又大方。嶺南各地，盛行寓有祝頌之意的「百合被」，算是婚嫁中最隆重的禮物。修女們煞費苦心所製成的錦衣錦被，也含祝頌之意，自可博老人們的歡心。</p>
<p>二十五間臥室</p>
<p>在二層樓和三層樓上，共有臥室二十五間，每間住十四人。單人的小鐵床，舖着淸潔的被單，配上紛麗的錦被，不知者還以爲是當家的內室呢。床頭另有小几，置放着隨身應用之物。</p>
<p>老人們過着很有規律的生活，淸晨起來，散步游戲，下午體力特別健康時，就幫着洗衣或灑掃房屋，又有特　　式紡車，爲老婦人們消遣之用。他們的工作，純以消遺爲主，不求任何工作成績，但大多數却以能多工作爲榮，晚飯後，如尙感到時光太早，可以結合三五個老伴，在散心室裏，隨便談笑，迫溯過去的舊事，大有髀肉復生之感。</p>
<p>修士輪流看護</p>
<p>安老院裏，　有完美的病房，爲患病的老人而設。女士們日夜輸流　護看。飮居起臥，全由她們扶持　其中有位七十多歲的老婆婆躺在病床上，另有一位　從徐匯女中畢業進院的練習姆姆，跪在床前餵食，旁邊更有女修士門照顧問候，使人回想到銀幕上伺候太后進餐的一幕。許多體力稍差的老人，也由修士門扶持他們入浴，聾·瞎·跛·　等殘廢者，更需要耐心照料。他們還特製了許多病人車，由修士們在園中推着，遊目馳懷，怡然自得。</p>
<p>安老院的事業，在歐洲已有一百餘年的歷史，在中國「敬老」也是一種古風，可是在上海，這安老院是貧苦無依的老人們僅有的安居之所。矢志守貞的修士們，誦經修道，不問世事，專心爲老人們服務。她們每個人都笑客可掬地侍奉老人，像侍奉自己慈愛的父母一樣，越工作越覺得高興，越爲她們自己的事業成就而愉快，這也許是聖靈充滿的緣故罷。</p>
<h3>棄嬰的「集中營」　「社會父母」的仁濟育嬰堂</h3>
<p>在上海，每天被拋棄的嬰兒，正不知有多少。他們大都因父母貧困，或子女過多，無力撫育而忍痛拋棄的，也有許多私生子，在社會的誹謗和禮敎的制裁之下。父母不得不放棄責任。誰來養育這一羣棄嬰呢？仁濟育嬰堂就負起了這「社會父母」的職責。</p>
<p>仁濟育嬰堂原是仁濟善堂事業之一。光緒十四年仁濟堂就堂內餘屋，舉辦一個「留嬰局』，專門收養棄嬰，特別僱用奶媽撫育，以全上蒼好生之德。不過因地位和經費的關係，一切因陋就簡。迨辦理日久，信譽車著，社會上同情者日多，經費稍稍充裕，於是規模略備，正式改名爲仁濟育嬰堂，民國九年，由各　事及士紳，籌集款項，在跑馬路購置房屋，養育棄嬰，才算踏上了正軌。這所上海僅有的棄嬰集中營，隔着遼闊的跑馬塲，正和國際飯店遙遙相望，是個很强烈的對比。</p>
<p>仁濟育嬰堂雖只是幾所舊屋，但看到牆垣上『仁濟育嬰堂』五個字，好像在發出『人類互助』的光芒。一進大門，就聽到許多出世不久的嬰兒們的啼聲，是在悲嘆塵世的惡濁呢，還是怨恨父母的狠心！</p>
<p>工人營養</p>
<p>仁濟育嬰堂所收容的嬰兒，分別用天然或人工的營養品養育着。人工營養部佔房屋二間，排列着二十多只小鐵床，每只床上，臥着一個可愛的嬰兒。嬰兒們的食品，以奶粉，奶糕爲主，有時也得到一點外界捐助的鮮奶，營養勉强足够。護士們分班日夜輪流照顧着。喂奶入浴，都有一定時間，每天還規定測量體重及體溫各一次，分別記載，以供醫生查考。</p>
<p>天然營養</p>
<p>天然營養部，是在東邊一連的三個房間內，排列着四五十只藤製的小吊床，雇着十幾個奶媽來担任撫義的工作，每人認定兩名或三名，如遇嬰兒過多時，則搭吃一點奶粉奶糕等替代品，以補入奶的不足。另外有一位女管理員。主持奶媽們的考勤及進退諸事。</p>
<p>對於嬰兒們的健康，他們也很注意，凡收進嬰兒，立即加以檢騐診斷。將檢查的結果，分別塡入收嬰簿。平日聘請中西醫生到堂診治病嬰。據說有許多貧苦的父母，直等到無可救藥手時，才忍心拋棄，所以往往不及診治，便已死亡。但他們對於棄嬰，只要一息尙存，無不盡力設法，眞是把他人的子女，看作自己子女一般。</p>
<p>領養手續</p>
<p>仁濟育嬰堂所收養的嬰兒，是允許一般無子無女的人前往領義的。領義的手續，首先塡具領嬰聲請書，經該堂審核後，發給空白保證書，由領養人及保證人塡具送堂，然後由該堂派員調查，認爲確屬身家淸白，職業正當，而能負担嬰兒養育費用者，經該堂通知後，方得前往抱領。他們對於領出的嬰兒，還隨時派員前往調查，如果認爲不滿意，或予警吿，或將嬰孩領回。但目前物價高昂，經濟情形困難，無力撫育子女而拋棄的數目日見增加，有力收領者亦日見减少，育嬰堂又安得廣厦千萬間，來收容他們呢？</p>
<h3>普善山莊簡史</h3>
<p>普善山莊是上海最大的施材機關，常我們看到漆着藍十字的卡車，在馬路上駛過，便會想到街頭的僵屍凍骨，也可得到入土爲安的歸宿，不致暴露街頭，實在給予死者以無窮的安慰，使繁華的都市，掩沒了不少貧乏的現象。</p>
<p>普善山莊是由慈善家王駿生在民國二年創設的，迄今已有三十三年的歷史了。那年冬天，街頭的路斃屍體，非常之多，打動了王氏惻隱之心。他便自己掏出錢來，在閘北買了一塊荒地，專做施材和安葬路斃者的工作，此即普善山莊的起源。</p>
<p>王氏</p>
<p>幾年來熱心的工作，很博得社會的同情，但王氏一人之力是不够的，於是不久便組織了董事會，籲請各界領袖援助，杜月笙王曉籟等，都被聘爲董事，工作上得到很大的幫助，事業範圍也漸擴充。民國九年又在閘北新民路創設普通醫院，專門免費爲貧家產婦接生，在夏天又施診，醫治時疫。同時又在普善山莊附近，設立普善義校，敎育貧苦失學子弟。這是較爲積極的工作。</p>
<p>普營山莊主要事業，在收屍和理葬工作，所以在大塲租地八百餘畝，作爲義塚。並在此廣大的土地上，劃出一部份作爲普善公墓，乃爲許多稍有資產而無地安葬者而設立的。抗戰後，大塲土地爲敵人徵築飛機塲，於是設法改在滬西虹橋，租用民田三百餘畝，後因該處埋棺滿，已毫無隙地，又另置靑浦　龍　一帶的空地，繼績埋葬。</p>
<p>八一三之役</p>
<p>普善山茲會盡最大的努力，爲淞滬抗戰史上留着很光榮的痕跡。那時普養山莊的服務人員，駛着卡車，在槍林彈雨中搶救傷兵，收葬殉難的英雄和死難的同胞。那時一部空卡車開出，總是滿載而歸。最高的紀錄，一天收屍達七萬具之多，其工作之緊張，可以想見。可惜不幸得很，普善醫院和普善義校，均被砲火摧毀了，最後，普善山莊也犧牲在抗戰中。</p>
<p>普善山莊雖曾受打擊，但主持的人並不氣餒，一本初衷，又從新創辦起來，在六馬路中央大戲院對面，借了一所簡陋的房子，從事他們的復興工作。不過事業範圍，祇能縮小，僅辦理施材與埋葬路屍。當時敵人汽油限制甚嚴，故改用橡皮塌車，每日在街頭巡視。</p>
<p>四塊薄板</p>
<p>窮人死了之後，無法收殮，都由普善山莊來担任。街頭屍骨，凡經附近居民報吿，或出警察局通知，他們便立刻來收去，警備司令部槍決的人犯，也由他們來殮理，普善山莊所收的屍體，都備薄板棺材一具，載往郊外安葬，在夏天，每日更分黎明和下午二次，因爲時間隔久了，是要腐爛的。小孩子的屍體，舉行火葬，但他們照例也給棺材一口。目下一口四塊薄板的棺材，約値一二萬元，因此普善山莊每月支出的數目很可觀。寄柩者或施材者的家屬們，有時情願掬出點錢來，捐給山莊。此外全仗董事們來維持。　現在普善山莊，除蟠龍鎮的義塚外，紅橋的地已在勝利後滿期了。此外惇信路設有專製簿板木棺的工塲，武定路設有堆積空材的塲所，跑馬廳路設有暫置屍棺的地方。辦事處則設在北海路二一〇號。</p>
<h3>新普育堂　五花八門　包羅萬象</h3>
<p>新普育堂，是一個組織龐大的慈善機關，有孤兒院。育嬰堂。養老院。殘廢院，以及施診給藥之所，五花八門，包羅萬象，可設是集慈善事業之大成。新普育堂由陸伯鴻先生創辦，迄今已有三十多年的歷史，所收容的老弱殘廢，孤兒寡婦，歷年來不下十餘萬人。試看南市國貨路畔這一百二十畝的廣塲，廿餘幢西式洋樓，在葱籠的林木中隱現着，恬靜。幽雅的環境中，充分顯出宗敎的嚴肅慈祥精神。這裏簡直不像一個慈善機關，而是一個新的社會，塵世上的「桃源」！</p>
<p>嬰兒部中，收容着五六十個兩三歲的乳兒，由一個義籍的姆姆照料着。裏而排列着小床，上面都有小羅帳。還有許多淡藍色的推動車，放在走廓裏。孩子們在蘋果似的小臉上，時常現出天眞活潑之色，尤其見到火姆姆來了，慈愛的問候，親熱的笑容，滿院洋溢的都是愛。實在可說那許多小孩子，都是這位姆姆的寗馨兒呢。</p>
<p>病嬰部與幼稚園</p>
<p>有病的孩子，另有病嬰部，和常兒隔離着。據說嬰兒初來的時候，百分之八十，都是有病的，經姆姆們盡心調治，才變而爲茁壯活潑。他們還養着十幾頭的乳牛，都是從社會熱心人士方面捐來的，嬰兒們有了鮮美的牛乳來喝，營養更爲充足。在此撫養成人，代爲婚嫁的，數目已不小了　嬰兒部後面有一所洋樓，是幼稚園部，住着七八十個小孩子，一部份由外面送來的，大多數是在嬰兒部中長大的。五六歲的小孩子，已經開始在受幼稚敎育。他們穿着一式的制服和膠鞋，在那裏歌唱遊戲。到七八歲時，就升班了。男的淡到一心小學去，女孩子則住在另一個院子中。那裏有寬大的自修室，潔净的飯應和浴室，樓上完全是臥室。她們一律藍衫黑裙，在附設的義務學校裏讀書。共中有一位雪珍小姑娘，是在民國廿六年國軍西撤時，三百多個遇難的孤兒中僅存的一個。姆姆講起當時在鐵門邊搶救孤兒的故事，雪珍姑娘的小眼裏，便閃動着淚珠了。</p>
<h3>大妹妹的家</h3>
<p>另一座二層的洋樓，是大妹妹的家。她們當初在襁褓中，由姆姆們撫育長大的，幾許歲月，幾許心機，現在均已二八年華，在　中待嫁的大姑娘了。她們修完小學，再敎些刺繡和烹飪等家務。男婚女嫁，是人生大事，大妹妹們出嫁是很鄭得的，經介紹相攸以後，再考慮對方的職業和生活。雙方認爲滿意後，然後擇日成婚。嫁出去的姑娘們，循例每年回堂省親一次，有時偕同丈夫孩子同來。孩子們稱姆姆爲外婆，姆姆亦當作自己的女兒女婿，親切地叙述家常。</p>
<p>殘廢院與養老院</p>
<p>殘廢院中住着四五十個殘廢者：瞎子·　子·啞吧·跛子·白癡等，各式殘廢的人都有。有一位，頭用本架支撑着，據說不然就會倒掛在肩上，還有一位十七八歲的少年，兩條腿已不知給誰搶去了。若和他們談起身世來，他們哽噎地說不下去，眼淚不住要流下來了。</p>
<p>養老院中住着六七十個五六十歲以上的老人，大多是貧寒出身，但也有一二位「過時」的老爺太太們。其中有一位曾老太是前淸的道台夫人，她曾隨任到各地，還能說各地方言。另一位杭州老翁姓周的，很慷慨激昂地訴說他當年的金戈鐵馬生涯，因戰事而家破人亡，以致淪落至此，言下不勝浩難。</p>
<p>新普育堂還辦了一所很完美的醫院，十多間的平房，住着百餘個病嬰和病孩，有許多都是不治之症，明知已不可救，但一息尙存，姆姆們總是悉心調護的。成人病房，分男女兩部，設備更爲完善。門診部施診給藥，成爲南市患病者聚散之所，夏天更爲熱鬧。</p>
<p>辦一所義務學校</p>
<p>此外他們還辦了一所義務學校，敎育一般貧苦兒童。有供給一千多人膳食的大廚房，自己養豬，飼鷄，種菜，畜兎，以節省開支，實爲本市最龐大的慈善團體。他們將孤兒自繈褓中撫養成人，再敎以謀生的知識技術，女的爲她們擇配遺嫁，代盡了仳間爲父母的責任。對於老年殘廢的人，則侍養以待天年，又肩起了爲人子者的擔負。新普育堂的事業，集父母子女的工作於一身。他們在天主敎敎義啓示之下，努力使事業發出更輝煌的光采，宗敎的精神是够偉大的。</p>

<h3>發展我國絲綢工業　先從改良蠶種做起　中蠶奉命草擬五年計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政當局計劃以巨大資金扶助我國絲綢業，自改良蠶種開始，以至繅絲與紡綢；各階段之生產設備及技術，完全使其現代化，並使絲綢之品質及生產成本，能暢銷海外。現已命中蠶公司起草計劃，期於五年之後，民間絲綢業能不再需政府之協助，有充分實力與他國競爭。目前即將舉行之蠶種改良委員會，實爲此項努力之起點，目的在搜集各方意見，以便訂定切合實際之改良計劃。至於各方代表之意見，大致可歸納如下：（一）舉辦蠶種貸款，該項貸款中，一部份用以改革設備，例如建立低溫室，設立幼蠶專用桑園，與在江浙兩省增加桑園等。另一部份爲生產貸款，希望能有七十億，分期貸放，待售種後歸回。（二）减除土種，以提高絲繭之品質，此項工作請江浙省政府切實辦理。（三）明春改良蠶種配售數之估計：江蘇六十萬張，浙江六十萬張，安徽廣東山東等省份共配五萬張，總計爲一百二十五萬張。估計江浙雲南能自產一百〇五萬張，故尚需自日本輸入二十萬張。此二十萬張中，半數配與浙江，半數配與蘇皖粵魯。（四）明春蠶種自由賣買。又絲業代表對於絲業戰時之損失，因日繭不允運華而更形憤慨，擬於短期內成立抗戰時期全國蠶絲業損失調查委員會，以確實之統計數字，提交中央戰時賠償委員會，以便他日要求日本賠償云。</p>

<h3>利息高成本大　絲織業危機嚴重　各廠貸款尚待央行核准　南洋市場我已坐失良機</h3>
<p>電機絲織業貸款，各項條件迄未經中央銀行核准，據該業公會理事長蔡聽濤云：目前各廠所需流動資金爲數頗鉅，約需數百億元，此款由中國交通二行向中央銀行轉拆頭寸貸放，每台織機可貸三百萬元，每廠以五億元爲度，不得超過，貸款抵押品一節，迄今猶在磋商中，銀行方面原定抵押品中七成爲原料人造絲，惟廠商認爲原料被押，如何生產，實不合情理，後議定五成原料，五成製成品，以後在必要時得以製成品陸續替出原料，再事生產，此項協議尚待中央銀行業務局長林鳳苞氏回滬核准，報傳業已核准說不確，又據蔡氏表示，電機絲織業目前除受高利資金之壓迫外，銷路不暢最爲嚴重之危機，國內市場受交通之影響，無法開展，國外市場則因成本關係，打開無望，我國根本無人造絲生產，故原料全部仰給日本，日本人造絲現每担五十萬元，中信局以易貨方式獲得此項人造絲，而配給廠商之人造絲，每担則需二百八十萬元，（本市黑市達三百八十萬）以如此高價之原料製成之生產品，自難與日貨競爭，故南洋各地之市場，我國已坐失良機云。</p>
<h3>所得稅局負責人談　商業報告注意事項</h3>
<p>商業資本一律以國幣計算</p>
<p>記者昨走訪所得稅局負責人，徵詢關於商業報告應注意事項，據告稱：（一）關於卅四年之商業報告，如無賬簿作爲根據，該局備有表格一種，供商號填寫，塡就以後，對於以後應付之所得稅，不得再有異議，填妥之表格及寫就之報告，應即送局，以待查核，（二）卅四年商業報告，有帳簿作爲根據者，需包括收入支出盈餘或損失，預算表等各項統計，（三）於卅四年曾有兩月營業時期之商號，需與卅五年之商業報告，同時寫就一併送局。</p>
<p>記者復詢以商業資本之標準，據稱：資本係指商業開始時之投資總額，如其資金非法幣，則需將此項外幣依照當時匯率，折合爲國幣計算，如商業總行在外國者，則國內分行所收之資金，亦可作爲資本，但當資本增加時，所得稅局則以是年各月底之資本平均額計算云。</p>
<h3>麵粉價格較限價爲低　粉商不願照限價領粉　粉業公會通知會員繳回購粉證</h3>

<h3>職業保險的種類與制度</h3>
<p>— 卜仁林</p>
<p>水險，火險，兵險，盜　險，這都是保障財產損害爲目的的保險，是對物的保險。</p>
<p>職業保險，是對人事上的保險，是保障從事於任何職業所獲得報酬的保險；設從業者報酬，遭遇停止時，使可獲得相當補償，減少失業時期生活上的痛苦。</p>
<p>職業的範疇很廣，以服務方式的不同，大概可分爲：</p>
<p>（一）自由職業　醫師律師會計師等。</p>
<p>（二）自營事業　運用資金，精神，勞力，直接經營於農工商業者。</p>
<p>（三）委任僱傭　由委任僱傭使用精神勞力而獲得報酬者。</p>
<p>自由職業者，依賴技術能力而獲得報酬，其事務的盛衰與收入之多寡，固非固定不變，那麼我們要使他們在業務清閒收入不足的時候，獲得援助，獲得補償，這種責任，應由職業保險來負担。</p>
<p>但是：自由職業者，其營業狀況與收入，因人而異，因地而異，因時而異，各各不同；投保職業保險，其保險額，固可由被保險人自己舉出，而保險人應當在什麽情形之下，賠償被保險人的損害，賠償金額照保額償付？還是照實際損害額償付？實際損害，又將怎樣根據事實？去作合理的判斷；這許多問題，是舉辦人事上的保險難以解決的問題。</p>
<p>對物的保險，必須保險物因不可抗力所遭受的損失，方　負担賠償的責任：然而：不可抗力事件的發生，是屬於偶然的；</p>
<p>職業保險是對人與事的保險，職業狀況的變換，完全由於人爲；職業盛衰，收入　　，從業者可以加以操縱，但是除本人以外，却無從預測其日後對營業所施展的方針與手段。</p>
<p>由於人事上多變，舉辦職業保險，必須根據各種職業的不同，地位環境的懸殊，分劃各種保險種類，設置各種制度，使適合各個事實上的需要，與保險人負担損害的範圍；並使保險人受收損害償金時，獲得需要的補償額，保險人也能夠在集中力量分担危險的原則之下，支付合理的賠償金。</p>
<p>自營事業，與自由職業的性質相似；不過自營事業，在技術能力而外，需要大量資金，以備業務上的運用，他的危害程度，除營業衰落，收入不足而外，更加有資本虧損的危害責任。</p>
<p>關於自營事業的財產部份，我們可以用財產保險（水火險等），來負担他的損害責任，但是由營業衰落，業務停頓，因而使自營事業者，收入停止時，應當用職業保險，使他獲得補償。</p>
<p>由委任僱傭，使用精神，勞力，而獲得報酬者，其遭受收入停止之原因，爲自動的辭職，改業，與被動的辭退，裁員，及服務機關本身解散。</p>
<p>職業保險，對於僱傭者所負担的責任，是援助解僱後的生活，減少失業痛苦。</p>
<p>根據上面敘述可以知道職業保險，因被保險人的地位不同，使所負担的責任，有複雜與單純，手續方面，有困難與簡便，考察損害，也因此發生無從根據，與較易調查。</p>
<p>職業保險，惟有因事制宜，各就其不同之的，設置保險制度。</p>
<p>職業保險制度可引用：</p>
<p>（一）責任保險制</p>
<p>（二）職業儲金制</p>
<p>自由職業與自營事業，範圍至廣，營業狀況變化繁複，損害賠償，難有確切的根據，故祗有利用儲金制，使從業者，從事於職業儲金，待收入減少，需要補償時，保險人除償付本息外，更額外給予特別規定的損害補償金。</p>
<p>委任僱傭者，因服務事業的不同，可分爲：</p>
<p>（一）軍界</p>
<p>（二）政界</p>
<p>（三）學界</p>
<p>（四）工商界</p>
<p>（五）農界</p>
<p>軍政爲國家事務，學校由官辦居多，故裁員，與解散，是屬於或然，解職，改業，被辭，是屬於常然；</p>
<p>工商界以僱主而分則有：</p>
<p>（一）國營事業</p>
<p>（二）公司組織</p>
<p>（三）合夥組織</p>
<p>（四）獨資</p>
<p>國營事業與公司企業，本身組織強固，故職員的辭職，改業，辭退，是屬於常然；裁員，解散，是屬於或然；惟合夥組織與獨資，裁員，解雇，比較容易發生。</p>
<p>農界之僱工，在國內所見，大都屬於臨時性質；長期僱工，爲數極微，故不　。</p>
<p>負担保險責任者，衡量被保險人損害發生可能性的大小，如可能性大，則負担的危險大，保險人自當增收保險費，並且對於賠償條件，規定範圍；損害可能性小，那麼减少保險費，或且放寬條件。</p>
<p>僱傭責任保險，根據危害性的大小，規定保險費；分別損害之發生原因，屬於常然或屬於或然，規定賠償金的成數；至於保險期限，防照火險制度，以年爲單位。</p>
<p>以上僅將　見所及略述一二，至於職業儲金，責任保險，應分劃幾種制度？被保險人發生損害時，應怎樣進行調查手續？獲得確切的證據；冒名作偽，應如何防止？保險契約，應如何訂立？等等問題，則有待保險專家，觀察社會職業狀況，依據法律，作詳盡的討論與設計。</p>
<p>至於推行職業保險的任務，組織團體，不如由保險職業來担任是項責任。</p>

<h3>河南醜劇的一幕　方城縣長私用軍糧價欵　地政局長代爲領款陷入重大嫌疑　十六日開封訊　本報駐汴記者王瘦梅</h3>
<p>在豫災呼籲團載負着豫省三千萬災胞的血淚，在京滬奔走呼號了兩個多月，剛剛歸來，各縣代表又像潮湧一般紛紛到省垣求救，省參議會爲搶救全省災黎，正請求政府裁員减政的聲浪中，河南官塲却演出了一齣醜劇，這齣醜劇，給河南政治以極大的諷刺，同時因爲輿論界及民意機關的嚴正指責，聽說有些還沒有露出馬脚的要人和縣長們，都開始手忙脚織，準備「收傢伙」，而且想不留痕跡的趕快把已經挪用或吞沒的軍糧價款悄悄的送還民間。</p>
<h3>趙作安扮主角　樊作民充配角</h3>
<p>這齣醜劇的演出，由方城縣長趙作安扮主角，河南省地政局長樊作民及方城縣糧政科科員薛斌卿作配角，其中還有一偶寃枉的可憐者，那便是方城糧政科長朱文彬，他算是配角的配角。劇情是私自用方城卅四年度軍糧價款一萬萬二千九百萬元作非法經營。全劇現正在續演，究竟應分幾幕幾塲，現在還沒法決定，今僅就記者五日來晝夜不停調查所得關於這一案發生和演變的經過，作一有系統的報導：</p>
<p>糧食部在谷省購買軍糧，並不是現品現款，常常是拖欠一年半載或三月兩月的，什麼時候發到省，沒人知道，什麼時候發到縣，沒人知道，什麼時候發到鄉鎭，更沒有人知道，什麼時候發到老百姓，那簡直連耶穌也不會知道！老百姓出糧食，認爲是應該，發價，那就認爲是上司的恩惠，這恩惠常常是水中明月鏡中花，可望而不可即的。即令發到了鄕公所，左抵右抵，抵光了，光吿老百姓說一聲，老百姓就會感激不盡的。天下烏鴉一般黑，多年來這種情形已經普遍到司空見慣，不足爲奇的程度了，這種社會環境和政治風氣，是使趙作安渾水摸魚的原因之一。其次，趙作安上層關係打的非常暢，而且拉的非常緊張此間所謂的「四大金鋼」，他都鬧的非常好，「四大金鋼」在河南，也的確有「旋乾轉坤」的力量，有這樣硬而有力的靠山，造成了他有所恃而無恐的心理，這是使趙作安敢膽大妄爲的又一原因，基於以上兩個原因，他大概早想着「撈」一下子的作法了。</p>
<p>本年六月初，部里撥到河南省田種處一批軍糧價款，這一批軍糧價款里邊，有方城三十四年度三至六月份軍糧價款一萬萬二千九百萬元，省田糧處於同月即轉令方城縣備文派員到省具領，該縣縣長趙作安當即派該縣糧政科科員薛斌卿携公文印領到省具領該款，薛到省後，省田糧處以所呈印領印鑑不符，未簽支票，時趙縣長適來省參加行政會議，當即親往田糧處交涉囑請主管人將手續不合之處批明返縣更正，田糧處主管人當即照辦，趙返縣後，適該縣田糧科長有變動消息，原任田糧科長朱文彬。正擬來省，趙縣長作安遂又將改正之印領交朱文彬帶省，協助薛斌鄕辦領款手續，同時趙作安並書一信致省地政局樊局長作民（「四大金鋼」之一）謂領款人等有事面陳，請延見等語，信由朱文彬帶省，朱到省將印領交薛斌卿後，即將趙函送樊局長作民，樊面允代辦，朱在省未久停即返縣，從此以後，就沒有見薛斌卿，返回方城，軍糧價款，也不見踪影。</p>
<h3>軍糧價款一億餘　左等右等均不見</h3>
<p>據該縣參議會秘書孫魯瞻報吿該縣參議會蕭議長稱：「八月二日在汴晤薛斌卿，據談稱，軍糧價款，已全數交地政局樊局長作民」。於是全縣各界都在靜默中等候這批一萬萬二千九百萬元的軍糧價款，可是左等也不見，右等也不見，一直到九月初，縣參議會，眞不能再緘默了，才正式用公事質問趙縣長，軍糧價款，到底弄到那兒去了，請趙縣長答覆，可是趙縣長老是支吾不覆。他們沒辦法，才由各機關推派代表到省追究，孫魯瞻代表參議會，袁子玉代表靑年團，連同前任糧政科長朱文彬等一行三人，九月七日離縣到省偵查，當時汴垣各報均載有「方城軍糧價款失蹤」消息，後經詳細偵查，才查出一這批鉅款，七月十八日由省田糧一處簽發支票，支票爲一二三七戶，六六一九八五號，經薛斌卿在七月十九日由中央銀行提出，經該代表等詢問樊局長作民，據談彼經手一萬萬一千萬元，餘一千九百萬由薛斌卿帶往漯河，經一再催樊局長作民速將原款交出匯縣，樊局長以匯路不通爲由，遲遲不辦，後來過了十來天，才在九月十七，十八，廿四三天分別匯許昌八千萬元，匯襄縣，葉縣各一千萬，交該代表等一千萬元現款帶回，（以上追究經過見孫魯瞻等致趙縣長電及孫上蕭議長簽呈）但這時候，這案子在沙城已經被多數人注意了。</p>
<p>十月初間，方城縣參議會蕭議長鄧鄕到了開封，正式向各有關機關控吿，沙城的報紙上也天天在顯著地位刊載這個消息，同時也正趕上顧兼主任祝同到汴，閱報知道了這個案子，並聞顧將軍曾以此事面囑劉主席澈查嚴辦，劉主席大概在這時吃了一驚，他覺得他的左右和部下都在騙他，他非常難過，也非常震怒，同時因爲各報紙對該案的揭破和指責，劉主席更生氣，一氣之下，就在本月初決定將趙作安撤職押解來省依法嚴辦，同時並將該案要犯方城糧政料料員薛斌卿及與該案有關之前任糧政科長朱文彬等分别一併扣押來省訊辦。在趙作安等將要押解到省的前兩天，經方城縣旅汴同鄉會決議，向趙作安提出三項質問，並將質問各點擬成啓事，於十月五日送汴垣各報社登載，以該啓事內涉及本省地政局長樊作民，樊氏當日就派地政局高級職員出外運動，運動的結果，大多數報館都沒有收到這項啓事，只有河南民國日報社收到這啓事。並且因爲運用較遞，該報已將原啓事排版，且已付印，未允抽版，輕前往運用人員回報樊局長，樊氏甚爲焦急不安，乃於當日深夜親往河南民國日報，與該社趙社長培五要求，將該啓事取消，時民國日報二三版已印就四千〇四份，原啓事已在一版印出，經一再商酌結果，趙允樊將已印妥之報由樊照原價每份一百五十元，按八折全數購去，計交報價現款四十八萬零四百八十元，另交加班費七萬元共合五十五萬〇四百八十元，將原啓事撤消，於是道啓事的內容就沒有人知道了，可是六號這天，開封好多人都知道有這件事情，據記者由監察使署某調查人員處獲悉，該啓事原文是這樣的：「方城縣旅汴同鄕會質問縣長趙作安啓事：查方城抗戰以還，迭遭天災人患，創鉅痛深，民不聊生，三十四年度征收軍糧，於萬分凋敝之餘，仍本「群其所有，供獻國家」之義，將血汗終年辛苦所得，忍痛輸將。閣下身爲民牧，對此種情况，豈能諉爲不知？上憲體念民困，提早撥發價款，爲杜絕貪汚計，並將各縣應得糧價數目，分別在省垣各大報登載，全豫民衆有目皆覩，乃方城三至六月份價款，一億二千九百萬元經閣下具領後，即宣吿失蹤。民衆業眼欲穿，查無音訊，經公推縣參議會秘書孫魯玲。靑年團代表袁子玉。前糧政科長朱文彬到汴多方偵詢，始悉閣下將該款於七月十八日由中央銀行提出，並將一億一千萬元交地政局樊局長作民，作陶朱事業，其餘飭薛科員斌卿帶漯河作「特種輕營」。孫秘書於九月二十五日（按或係九月十五日之誤）謁見地政局樊局長，力陳方城民衆苦况，始允當交現款一千萬元，兌許昌八千萬元，　宛各一千萬元，不足之數，由薛某回時歸還，事實供在，有該員等與閣下所發電報爲證，茲經本會決議，向閣下提出質詢三點：（一）方城民衆，贫窮凋敝，上項軍糧價欲，領出將近三月，閣下何忍將此款交與別人遠法使用。（二）公款經商，委座手　皇皇，懸爲厲禁，閣下糧政科員薛斌辦帶款赴漯，至今滯留不歸，其餘整款分數處零匯是否干犯官常？（三）閣下旣將此款作「陶朱事業」，按通常每月二分利計算，所得利潤，不下六七千萬之多，此項收人是否應入閣下私囊，以上三項望閣下迅賜明白答覆，此款在方城四十萬民衆中，無論男女老幼，每人均須負担，且係中央德意，萬目睽睽，如旱望雨，希捐錙殊勝算，開誠相吿！會址三聖廟後街十七號。」</p>
<p>豫人協助國軍修葺碉堡　（特派員邵愼之攝）</p>
<h3>啓事挿曲鬧出後　社會上益滋疑竇</h3>
<p>從這登啓事的小插曲鬧出以後，社會人士越發疑惑樊局長，監祭糾舉機關，也特別注意樊氏，記者對此案，始終也隨着一般人士的眼睛，大家看到那兒，記者也就特別注意那兒，樊氏當然成了記者重要採訪對象之一。可是樊氏這幾天非常神秘，連影子也見不着，聰說他這幾天鷄鳴即出，深夜始歸，神色頹喪慌張，各處奔走活動，但這樣並不能减少他的嫌疑，相反的因爲他這種神態，使監察糾舉機關的調查人員，在調查時更其不敢馬虎，據記者自調查人員方面獲得最確實消息，當時領款經過及領出後支配情形以及案發後提款匯出情形是這樣的：七月十八日河南省田糧處簽發方城軍糧價款一億二千九百萬元支票，支票爲一二二七戶，六六一九八五號，七月十九日由薛斌卿到中央銀行將該款全部提出，惟薛僅拿去二千九百萬元，以一千萬存匯源銀號，餘一萬萬元又以「來人」名義暫存中央銀行。七月二十三日匯源銀號史舜華持「來人」存摺，到中央銀行提出七千萬元，八月一日匯源銀號史舜華又特「來人」存摺到中央銀行提出三千萬元，薛斌卿所領之一千九百萬元，在汴購布一百疋，海洛英四袋，盤紙五大箱，由方城王某陪同，運往漯河，（另某查案人證實盤紙五大箱係在汴大有紙廠購妥後尙未起運）餘一萬萬一千萬元，由樊作民以「方記」名義存匯源銀號，然後又以中國銀行爲跳板，將該款分存中國，交通，金城三銀行，最後仍均提存匯源錕號，（按匯源銀號爲本省軍政金融界要人所組成之私人銀號）該款在存匯源銀號期間，暗地如何提出，作何項活動，現仍由監察使署調查中，據未證實消息，該款已帶往上海購貨，現貨已運至徐州，侯信運汴。）及九月間方城代表到省追究此款，樊作民及匯源銀號以款已另有用項，一時湊不來款，又恐露出馬脚，於是匯源銀號在九月中旬那幾天，銀根異常吃緊，如有人到該號提款，或私人通融款子，該號負責人就說：「這幾天爲要凑齊七千萬元急款，一點辦法也沒有！」但方城代表們緊跟着苦苦哀求，沒辦法中，由樊作民及匯源銀號會同出外活動，因匯源銀號和各銀行平日多有來往，於是就拿到中國，金城，交通三銀行收款回單一紙，（計中國銀行二千萬元，交通銀行三千五百萬元，金城銀行四百六十萬元）合計作現金五千九百六十萬元，匯源銀號拿二千四百萬元支票（該支票號碼爲B〇三八六三九號，賬號七四二號）以上共八千三百六十萬元，九月十七日由樊局長親到省銀行仍以「方記」名義匯往許昌省銀行（方城距許昌較近，方城無銀行）八千萬元，除滙費外，尙餘三百一十七萬三千三百三十三元尾數，樊局長在當時決沒有顧慮到後來會有人來查賬，所以連考慮也沒有，就把這三百多萬元囑省銀行收地政局暫存脹內。關於這一點樊局長後來很懊悔，可是調查人員却把這一點當作了寳貝也似的證據。九月十八二十四兩次又由省銀行滙襄縣葉縣各一千萬元。</p>
<p>十三日趙作安等，便已經押解到汴，由保安司令部收押了，劉主席爲恐這干人犯等互相串供，所以親下手令禁止該犯等與外界接見，樊局長作民曾經用盡了方法，想和趙作安見一面，聽說劉主席也寫了一張條子准他接見，但被看管人擋駕了，本月十四日豫魯監察使署調查科長劉文斌到省保安司令部提訊趙作安，薛斌卿，朱文彬等，據聞趙作安供此案舞弊情形，他一點也不知道，應該負責的是薛斌卿和樊作民，薛斌卿供奉趙縣長命到省領款，款領出後交樊局長，如何無弊，他一點也不知道。朱文彬因爲始終沒有參加領款，當然也問不出什麼。</p>
<p>這幾天，沙城各處都是在談這個案子，有向燈的，有向火的，有兎死狐悲的，有懷揣鬼胎而隨聲附和的，忙煞了金鋼，也忙煞了監察使署的大批調查人員，劉主席有病不辦公，也不見客，但聽說對於這一案件異常重視，據說他因爲要嚴辦，所以不主張將全案送法院，他要以軍法從事，辦的痛快些，好多冷眼人都在瞪着眼睛，等着瞧，看劉主席有沒有決心殺兩個貪官汚吏：</p>
<p>監察使署今天下午已傳訊了樊作民，樊氏神色倉皇，對此案連這：「爲朋友帮忙，落這麻煩，眞想不到！這次代方城領軍糧價款，當時以匯兌不便，延誤時間，引起各方誤會，深感傷心，」並稱：「盼對此案勿使擴大，如擴大，恐牽扯太多，影響全局……。」據監察使署某高級負責調查人對記者談稱：全案證據已搜集齊全，調查工作完畢，糾舉書正在整理中，日內即可發出了。</p>
<p>這齣醜劇，太醜了，因爲他的演出，把河南政治舞台都弄成骯髒的了，什麼時候才能閉幕呢？從什麼時候起河南的政治舞台上才會永遠不演這類醜劇呢？大家都在悲忿中苦痛着，希望着！</p>
<p>袁世凱解散國民黨後，　國二年十二月，召集政治會議，其主要工作，除解散國會及省議會外，即在修改臨時約法。三年一月二十四日，議定的法會議組織條例，成立的法會議。開會時，袁氏以增修臨時的法大綱咨送到會，經同意通過後，遂於民國三年五月一日，由袁氏公佈，新的法之內容，將總統權力大爲增加。　民國四年十二月，袁氏稱帝，各省紛起聲討，袁知大勢已去，下令恢復共和，仍稱總統。旋病故，黎元洪出任大總統，恢復民國元年臨時約法，重行召集國會，組織憲法會議，以天壇憲法草案爲根據，繼續工作。六年六月，張勛入京，國會二次解散，制憲工作，又吿浦形擱置。</p>
<p>黎政府因參戰問題，段祺瑞內閣與國會意見相左，黎在武力壓迫下，下解散國會令，繼則辭大總統職，由馮國璋繼任，仍以段任總理。馮段主政，棄舊國會不顧，另組臨時參議院，議定國會組織法及選舉法，於民國七年，由馮正式頒佈。</p>
<p>國父以北京政府默認黎氏非法解散國會之行爲，有背約法精神，送赴粵倡言護法，由南下之參衆兩院議員合組非常會議，宣吿改開正式國會及憲法會議審議會，但未獲具體結果，遂於九年一月由議長林森，宣吿暫時停止議憲。</p>
<p>十一年六月，黎元洪復任總統，撤消第二次解散國會之令，國會遂得在北京開會，議定在十二年八月底以前完成憲法，九月底以前，實行選舉總統。不意十二年六月間，黎氏被迫再度下野，國會議員，紛紛南遷，北方政客，不惜輦金南下，賄買議員，一部份乃竟又北返，國會遂於九月召開。十月五日，曹錕賄選吿成，以四百八十票獲選爲大總統。憲法亦在數日內草草通過公佈。</p>
<p>十三年十一月，段祺瑞就執政職，不召集國會，亦不承認十二年草率通過之憲法，僅頒佈善後會議條例。十四年二月，復續頒國民代表會議條例，其任務爲制定憲法及其施行細則，段並曾组織憲法起草委員會，通過一中華民國憲法草案，然該委員會本身組織已有疑問，且未付國民代表會議議決也。</p>
<p>國父逝世後，中國國民黨政治委員會議決，改革命政府爲國民政府，並通過國民政府組織法，是爲我國國民政府根本組織法之鼻祖。十六年三年，改組國民政府並修正國民政府組織法。十七年二月，復加修改，同年十月，正式公佈採用五權制度，仍名爲國民政府組織法。</p>
<p>民國十九年十一月，第三屆中央執行委員會全體大會中議決召集國民會議。國民會議於二十年五月五日在南京開會，制定「訓政時期的法」八十九條，由國民政府於六月一日公佈，是爲訓政時期之根本法。</p>
<p>中國憲政運動之醖釀，經此若干次之嘗試與挫折，乃漸吿成熟。民國二十一年十二月，國民黨四屆三中全會開會，乃決議召集國民大會，制定憲法，結束訓政。復經三年餘之籌備，而後有五五憲草之公布，是爲此次國民大會中所討論之憲法藍本。</p>

<h3>乃比里出國瑣話　引諺語稱：狹地能居狹心不能相處</h3>
<p>— 本報旅行記者黃潔蓀　廿九日寄自曼谷</p>
<p>暹羅元老　巴立，（又名乃比里）此次出國訪問列强，首先專機前往我國，這是中暹邦交成立之後的一件盛事，同時，也是中暹邦交上的一種紀程碑。中暹邦交能否更進一步，受制於人的苦難中的　羅能否從此獲得轉擭，完全視乎元老此行的結果如何而定。鍳巴立在出國的前夜，對記者稅：本人此次獲得機會前往中國觀光，本人方面，係藉此機會增加智識，但是，另一方面的任務，則爲使中暹邦交更臻親密。總之，本人此次的訪問　國，可以包括三點：第一，爲增進各盟邦之友好；第二，向蔣主席致敬。對於蔣主席的雜護暹羅領土和主權的究整，始終堅持給矛暹羅的帮助，本人和暹羅全國民衆都很感激。在抗日期間，從無綫電中聽到中團將支持暹羅到底的蔣主席的聲明，當時實在增強本人的抗日決心。第三，本人此次訪問貴國，如李大使所說，中國政府及全體人民，並不是以遠客看待，而是以兄弟之誼的一片熱愛來相招，本人眞感到無限的欣慰。同時，也使本人記起兩句諺語：『狹地能居，狹心不能相處。』由於中國政府及人民的隆重而誠懇的表示，寫實上，兩國間的關係，已經是在極親密的境地之中了。</p>

<h3>憲政運動回顧　從臨時約法到五五憲草</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>武漢舉義後，十四省先後宣吿獨立，然仍皆各自爲政，不相爲謀，江浙兩省都督乃倡議建立統一的政府機構。辛亥夏曆九月二十五日，各省會議於上海，承認武昌爲民國中央軍政府，而以鄂軍都督執行中央政務。復應鄂督之請，各省派遣代表赴武昌會商臨時政府組織事宜，結果於十月十三日通過「中華民國臨時政府組織」大綱二十一條，是爲民國成立後最初的根本法。</p>
<p>旋甫京光復國父自歐返國，當選爲臨時大總統，成立南京政府。民國元年一月二十八日，參議院成立後，組的法起草委員會，從事臨時的法之擬訂工作，完成後，由大總統在三月十一日公佈，稱爲「中華民國臨時的法」。</p>

<h3>擴展銀行業務之建議</h3>
<p>— 俞增康</p>
<p>近數年來，銀行創設衆多，蓬勃子象，更屬空前，此豈眞正的繁榮嗎？然究其實際，業務的不當，達於極點，已棄正當業務於不顧，僅在追逐高利而已。爲追逐高利，乃不擇手段，或對投機者接濟，或作高利貸，有竟更自營投機囤績，以圖一時之倖；業務發展眾此，便失銀行創設的原意，此豈又爲銀行本身之利呢？銀行的繁榮，如建於投機和高利貸之上，其不能持久，過去的前例，已屢見不鮮。然則銀行業爲何蹈於覆轍而不思自拔，且尙在繼續的加深，致危機業已四伏。考其原由，不外下列數額：</p>
<p>（一）我國銀行業雖有驚人的發展，然整個制度尙未健全建立，因而發展的動向，時爲經濟環境所決定。現今經濟狀况旣加深悲化，銀行業務自亦更爲不合理，過去消極性管理的不能奏效，即可爲證。</p>
<p>（二）我國銀行業的資力素爲薄弱，現今小行莊競設，金融力量史爲分散，且存款又有量的暗降，質的變化；故可用資力降至極低，對金融調劑，已感乏力；况成本增重，開支浩大，困難重重，自不得不得徊歧途，追逐高利，以資維持的了。</p>
<p>（三）我國金融與產業素稱脫節，現今工商又深陷危機，銀行業自不肯再爲調劑產業信用的了。</p>
<p>這種不合理趨勢，非但無利於銀行本身，更有害於整個經濟，况戰後經濟，亟待建設，這種局勢，自不容再予延續。但欲改善，又非易易，上述成因旣如此複雜，無怪消極性措置的不能奏效。</p>
<p>爲改善現狀，打開困境，而求擴展業務，使能充份發揮調劑的效力，我們以爲第一須增强資力；第二須扶助它開設資的新途徑。這兩點都是針對上述的畸形狀態而發的；且此不可缺一，因不增强資力，而强欲其調劑產業金融，實不可能；資力如能積極增強，而沒有新的投資途徑，則又將出現金融資金沒有正當出路的苦悶，所以任一的單純措置，仍救不了銀行業的危機，亦不能有助經濟的發展。</p>
<p>（一）設法增強銀行業的資力</p>
<p>增　實力實爲　　業務的先決條件。銀行資力又可區別爲二，一爲資本金，一爲存款。在今信用發達之際，存款雖已爲銀行資力的主要來源，但資本金仍不失爲銀行信用的基礎。按諸各國經驗，存款增加都與資本強弱成正比例，資本雄厚，信用鞏固，對存款的吸收力，自亦增強，所以存款最多的，都是資本最充實的銀行。近年來爲適應信用的發達，各國銀行更積極增加資本，小行已難以競爭，漸爲淘汰，因而又發見銀行集繼續分散，實爲最大原因。是以挽救當前的金融危機，增加資本金，實爲首要。况我國商業銀行尙須兼營產業信用，則資本更有積極增加的必要。過去對資本額朱有限制，小行濫設，且一遇投機景氣，更呈蓬勃之象，如是發展，殊爲危險，此種趨勢，今後展須矯正。銀行法修正草案對資本最低額的規定，雖已提高，然在工業化時，尙嫌過低，仍難阻資力分散的趨勢。無論在經濟上或銀行木身上講，資本金都有再爲增加的必要，寗可多淘汰些小行莊，以謀金融基礎的鞏固。且在必要時，我們尙須推行合併的措置，以配合世界金融集中的潮流。爲推行合併的運動，我們便不須限制銀行爲他銀行的股東，且更須鼓勵大銀行向小行莊參加股本，况令小行莊資本低薄，極易爲大行所操縱，如能握有三分之一以上的股份，即可進行合併。過去主張合併的，頗不乏人，然亦都認困難重重，難適於我國。不過問題在於怎樣遂能參加股本到小行去，是深値研究的。我國銀行派別殊多，經營方式又不盡同，股東更不願將股份貿然讓給他人，以失管理權，這是合併上的最大困難。但可利用金融上和債描人的壓力，迫使改組，而由大行參與股份。或將垂危的行莊，迫使淸理，而由大行收購。這種辦法，各國已多前例，且均能收宏效，我國自亦宜仿傚的。</p>
<p>資本如能積極增加而集中，吸收存款的力量自亦能增强。現今存款的銳减，原祗爲暫時的現象，經濟如能安定，社會資金即能重歸銀行業；戰前的現象雖較現時爲勝，亦未能謂佳，存款數亦很微小，不足以任調劑產業信用之責；因產業規模尙小，所須資金不巨，尙能應付，今後工業化，規模擴大，資金籌要量必爲激增，銀行欲能調劑圓滑，必須有更多的資力。是須積極推行儲蓄政策，以集中社會資金，增强可用的固定資力，同時須擴展信用，以增加活期存款，充裕流動資金，所以對於過去的存款政策，已有重加厘訂的必要。更要者，爲避免資金的浪資，擴大運用的能力，則須速建中央銀行與商業銀行的聯緊關係，存款準備制度的改善，和再貼現與公開市塲政策的運用，使銀行能將庫存現金和存放同業等準備金，减至最低限度。且有中央銀行爲援助，銀行業自敢大量經營流轉性較慢的產業信用了。</p>
<p>平時的存款政策旣須如是改進，然則現時將如何？現時尙處非常狀態，經濟繼續動盪，社會資金仍無望速復集中金融業，此勢豈容再長，不速謀改進嗎？目前銀行業的二千億存款，即使都能安心運用，亦不敷二三業之需要。存款情形再如是惡化，銀行亦終將難棄追逐高利的業務。爲挽救產業和銀行本身的危機，都須速謀存款資力的增强。當前社會資金雖仍　動，而因投機途徑的漸狹，高利貸的危險，部份資金已有安定之思，及時吸收，不失良機，吸收之道，則爲提高存息。存息提高，豈非增加成本，加重困難嗎？此說雖是，殊不知存息提高，可吸收較多存款，存款增加，業務可擴充，利潤更可增多。將存放息的拔開，原爲不得已的辦法，現時存息過低，引不起存款者的興趣，於是社會資金寗冒險自放，或存於地下錢莊，以博高利，銀行存息如能作適常的提高，雖不及暗息之半數，人民爲本利的安全，自亦願存於銀行的。此以定存的而言，至於活存，流動頻繁，提高存息，徒增負担，於行無益；且活存者在求收支的便利，而不在利息的高低，所以利息雖高，亦不能增加存款數額的；欲求活存的增加，有賴於信用制度的發達。所以提高存息，應以定存爲限，活存尙不需要。其雖增加銀行資金的成本，但定存的增加，足以改善銀行資力的現狀，並能有助銀行業基礎的鞏固。</p>
<p>（二）開闢投資產業的新途徑</p>
<p>資力增强後，乃須指導投資新途徑的開關，否則仍如過去，叉將再現沒有正當出路的苦問，於整個經濟和銀行本身，仍爲無利。</p>
<p>在戰前各行雖漸努力經營產業信用，但工貸數額仍僅佔放款總數的一成左右，調劑產業信用業務的不易展開，可以想見。現今銀行的放款業務，受存款情形的限制，數額銳減，且內容亦起變化，定期放款已不足百分之二，此區區之敷，自不能滿足產業信用的需要，因而產業界不得不要求國家銀行給以資金的援助。</p>
<p>當局鑒於銀行業的不重視產業貸放，而產業對資金又是迫切的需要，遂於管理銀行辦法有對工礦事業貸放的最低額之規定，但其下又有不得投資產業爲股東的限制。如此規定，終覺是矛盾的，不得爲股東，如何能鼓勵其投資於產業呢？祗融通短期信用，不供給長期資金，，仍無助於產業的建設，於以非常狀態爲依據的管理辦法或尙可，而以平時狀態爲依據的銀行法修正草案便不應再採此種態度了。况我國金融與產業素爲脫節，欲期聯繫，便不應多加限制。所以管理辦法施行以後，徒成具文，無裨實際。欲使銀行資金運用到生產事業去，便須指導而鼓勵，並給以投資的便利。</p>
<p>德國銀行是採兼營主義的，它的成例，我們是可仿傚，且對銀行資金的運用，又有合理的劃分，對我銀行法的修正，都可作重要的參考。以短期資金調劑商業信用，固定資金調劑工業信用，如是長短期資金便可各得其所，無所困難，較諸强以存款總額的百分之五十或三十，合理多多，且將短期資金用於產業信用，殊爲危險，有損銀行的基礎。我國產業借取短期資金，尙無過度困難，而籌措創設資本，確極不易，便不應限制銀行業的援助。銀行法更應進一步的鼓勵銀行參加產業的發起人，和股票的承受。銀行添列股東，便可指導營業，利潤有保障，遂敢大量投放；承受股票，可因產業興盛而獲巨利；如是始能增强銀行業投資產業的興趣。</p>
<p>再今國營與商營的業務之未能明確劃分，非但不能收分工合作之效，反有官民爭利之象；即於產業資金的調劑，不由扶助商業銀行經營，而由國家銀行供給，這也是妨碍銀行業務擴展的一個主要原因。現在賴發行以供產業資金，已不是合理的，再加供應方式之不善，更非圓滑產業金融上所應有的現象。國家銀行應速專業化，完成爲各類信用的中樞機構，不經營直接貸放，避免與商業銀行相競爭，且更須給以極大的融通和支持，這樣遂能刺激銀行業務的擴展。</p>
<p>上述兩個辦法，必須同時施行，始能充份發揮各自的作用。此兩點也是此次修正銀行法上的兩個要點，且當局也有意於集中金融力量和採兼營主義，但惜過份謹愼的限制條文太多，致修訂原意恐將無法實現，且銀行業不免仍處徬徨，難於遵守，勢將影響合理的銀行制度之建立，是以此點尙待商榷，重加厘訂，旣能適合國情，又能給銀行業一個新的活動力。</p>

<h3>英國產業在復興中</h3>
<p>— 雪岩</p>
<p>在英國以外的人，都知道英國爲今日世界三强之一。在美蘇對立中，英國介乎其間，有平衡左右之用。這實是英國在外交上所表現的一面，也是比較有聲色，比較動人聽聞的一面。但大國的地位，不是靠排隊站班得來的，也不是　在國際會議中雍容揖讓，或在聯合國安全理事會中充一陣南郭先生所能博得的，本身須有實力來作後盾，來支持。英國在這次戰爭中，經濟損失，相當重大，是無可否認的，海外投資，折賣或抵押殆盡，人民生活，也很艱苦。所以戰後問題，最迫切的無過于增加國富，和改善人民生活，今日在英國內部的人，所關切的，也是以這二件事爲最。全國上下所着力的，也是這二件事。</p>
<p>經過一年餘來的努力，負責綜理全國經濟建設事業的樞密院長莫理遜（Morrison）昨日特招待新聞記者，報吿檢討英國生產復員的情形時，已能很自豪的說，「一年前有破產之危的一個國家，今日在實業戰塲（Lncuslrial　Fronts）上，已趕上或超過了很多國家」。他這句話不是瞎吹，確有事實做根據，因爲今年英國實業界的生產量，沒有一個月，低于一九三五年四月份的生產量，而在輸出方面，就首三季而論，亦較一九三九年同期至少增加百分之十。這樣一邊要復員，一邊要擴大生產事業，同時並進，而能有這樣成績，舉世迄無其匹。怪不得財政大臣陶爾登（Daltou）在美國　聯合國銀行會議歸來後，第一次發表演說就說·「英國生產，從戰時恢復到平時之迅速與順利，已經博得全世界的贊揚了」。</p>
<p>解甲歸工</p>
<p>英國這一年來的建設工作，綜合起來，可以分成三方面：（一）士兵復員，把作戰的軍隊，迅速地改編成生產隊伍。這方面的成橫，最好拿幾個數目字來說明。據國防部說，自日本投降，至今年八月止，英國解甲的士兵，的共七百萬，這七百萬人已從惟界各地運回英國，編入各生產部門，從事工作。另據勞工部本月十七日發表報吿，目前從事生產工作的人，共二千零十萬餘人，較之一九三九年中的一千九百七十餘萬人，已增加約四十萬人。其中受工廠雇用的，在今年八月底爲四百八十八萬餘，與一九三九年同期的四百六十八萬相比，也增加二十萬左右。從這比較的數字中，便知目前英國勞力的運用，不但已恢復戰前舊觀，且已較戰前有改進。</p>
<p>（二）工業復員，即是把戰後停造或改裝的工廠，恢復起來，生產平時物品，並把某幾種特別需要物品，增加生產。道方面的成績，比較難說，不是單靠簡單的數字所能表明的。因爲第一有原料問題，英國本身不生產原料，而戰前英國所仰給的原料生產地，受了戰事影響後，還來復原，因此生產受影響。最明顯的例子，莫如中國本身，戰前英國一部分的原料，是從中國輸入的，但目前中國，簡直不能輸出，即有現成物品，也價格太高，不能問津，第二有運輸問題，無論原料輸入或成品輸出，無不受運輸力的限制，因此自然也影響到生產方面。</p>
<p>統制與計劃</p>
<p>（三）統制問題，各種工業如聽任其自由復原，自由發展，必造成畸形狀態，最能營利的生產品，必擴展最速，于是搶着拉工人，搶着買原料，而把眞正爲社會所需要的工業，反擠在後邊，恢復不起來，結果勢必造成社會混亂，物價上漲，經濟破產。所以英國是採取統制政策的，復員工業的先後與膨大，都須要按照優先等級，然後才能購到原料，雇到工人。因此工業的復員，不完全是恢復戰前舊狀，而是根據戰前經騐，作合理改進。</p>
<p>最後一點牽涉到一個政策：推行社會主義。生活享受的平等，是當今談政治的一個主要因素。英國財當的差異，沒有美國那樣懸殊，也沒有中國那樣畸形，幾百萬人民在餓死，億兆人民，在衣不蔽體，食不果腹的悲慘情形下，同時却有人在發國難財，勝利財，貪污財，把黃金美鈔，拚命塞到外國銀行的保險庫去。但無論如何，英國也有很大的貧富差別，而且這種差別，因受戰爭的影響而益形尖銳。工黨之所以能獲勝當政，蓋其政策在逐漸消　這道貧當閱的鴻溝，使社會財富與享用的分配，改變方式。所以當政以後的使命，就在實現這項政策。其具體表現，爲各種國營政策，其最大的如煤礦，英吉利銀行，燃料，動力等已開始國營。此外鐵道電訊等業，亦即將實行。他如醫藥事業的社會化，社會保險制度的推行，每週四十小時工作制的設計，和高等敎育的普及，目的都是在改善大多數人的享受。這一年來工黨政府的成績。也很可觀，人民對其信任，允可注意。自去年八月當政迄今，每决議員出缺補選時，工黨十九獲勝，從未失去過一席，據陶爾登說，當政一年後的政府，而仍能在每塲選舉中獲勝者，自一八七四年以來爲第一次。</p>
<p>工黨成績斐然</p>
<p>這三件大事，要做好一件，已够艱巨了，而工黨政府能同時並進，確有過人之處。我們早就知道，英國的輸出品，已漸復戰前數字，其中若干種出品，且已超過。昨日莫理遜在招待記者席上，更詳述好幾種生產數字，證明其事，其主要者爲鋼鐵，今年八月，較一九三五年同期增加百分之十八，較一九三八年同期增加百分之十三。鋁在一九三五年時，月產額爲一二五〇噸，而今年的月產額，平均增加一倍，工具機械（Machine　Tools），較一九三五年時增加百分之五十。電燈泡一九三五年時，年產一億枚，今年可造一億八千枚，鬧鐘等戰前英國本不生產，目前也在大量製造。</p>
<p>人民生活　難如理想</p>
<p>生產雖在增加，但目前英國的生活，最主要的現象，仍爲物品缺乏，其故何在呢！據官方報吿，綜合成左述數因：</p>
<p>（一）戰爭期間，許多日常需用之物，祗有破壞損創，缺乏修理補充，幾年積壓下來的工作，現因戰事停止，急需追捕修葺，因此移用於這方面的物資人力甚多，最明顯的，莫過於房屋問題及公用事業問題，現用單從事建築的工人，達一百二十餘萬人，其他建築材料，需量也同樣的大，這自然影響到其他物產。</p>
<p>（二）需要增加，據莫理遜說，現在英國的鋼產量，已超過戰前百分之十，但需要更遠過此數，鋁的生產，較戰前增加一倍，但需要却增加二倍，所以仍嫌不足。他又說因需要量增加而感覺物品不足的現象是健全的，這種發展沒有止境，社會因欲滿足這種要求而進步。戰前的現象，生產過剩，購買力薄弱，是個病態。現在社會購買力旺盛了，生產界應該來滿足這種需求。莫理遜又說購買力的分配改善後，要求也曾增加，譬如現在英國牛奶，啤酒，香烟，鋼器，電力的產量，遠過戰前，但因人民購買力的分配，經政府努力改善，人人皆有力享受，目前反感不足。所以政府努力實行社會主義，改進人民的普遍購買力，也是目前物資缺乏的原因之一。</p>
<p>鼓勵出口事業　國內需要次之</p>
<p>（三）製造出口貨。英國因爲要增加海外資財，所以生產事業中最高的優先權，給予製造出口貨的廠家。最近海外貿易部舉辦一個「英國能製但國內不能買到的商品展覽會」，哄動全國，如要去參觀一趙，須排隊等候二小時餘，才有機會入塲，其受人注意如此。中間陳列商品凡五千餘種，都是上等精製品，都是已銷售海外，但暫時尙不許在國內發賣的物品。這樣努力爭取海外市塲，自亦爲物品缺乏之一主因。</p>
<p>（四）與鼓勵出口相反，則有入口貨的嚴格限制。英國有許多物資，戰前需賴海外輸入，如食品及一部分化裝品等，食品是無法省免的，但被减到最低限度，海外輸入的化裝品，簡直絕了跡。目前在英國的人，所最感不足的是舶來品。但因輸出的迅速增加，將來也可望改善。事實上，目前英國的生活，已較一年前爲佳了。</p>
<p>結論：兩大課題</p>
<p>增加生產與社會主義的推行，是目前英國內部最重要的課題。政府各部中，一大半與此二事有關。但總司其事，統盤籌劃者爲樞密院長莫理遜，他是經濟設計委員會的主席。他是工黨中最有組織幹才最有魄力的一人。今年七月，總理大臣艾德禮本有訪澳之議，在艾德禮留澳期間，總理一職，預定由莫理遜代理，政府的公報也已發表，後來艾德禮因事中止赴澳，代理自亦不需要。前任糧食部長史密斯（Ben　S—mith）之去職，盛傳由於莫理遜之不滿意他的工作。由道二件事中，可知莫理遜今日在政府中的地位，以這樣的人物，來專主全國生產事業，也可覘知其重視的程度爲如何了。</p>
<h3>錯誤心理的影響</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>愛用國貨運動的標語「用國貨最光榮」是針對着一般人以用洋貨爲光榮的心理。創導這個運動的胡伯翔先生，曾經舉過一個實例，他說有一個朋友家裏陳列着許多化妝品，他以爲是外國貨而頗自以爲榮，但在內行人看來，實在並不是外國貨，不過是用了英文的商標和貼頭罷了。</p>
<p>事實上這一種錯誤的心理，彤響中國工業很大。由於這一種心理作祟，曾經使許多人吃虧。我們不妨舉幾個例來說明：</p>
<p>一，因爲國人有以用洋貨爲榮的心理，許多自作聰明的生意人，向國外定了許多藥品，披肩，雨衣，食品之類，結果十個人中倒有九個是虧本的，將中國的金條，大量流到國外去，沒有一個人得到實惠，而中國工業，首先受到打擊，中國市塲，弄得更形混亂。</p>
<p>二，因爲國人有以用洋貨爲榮的心理，投機商人就仿造洋貨，貼上洋貨的商標，結果用戶無不上當。以最近而論，因爲羢綫風行一時，市上就有所謂澳洲羢綫出現，實潔上是在上海用短羊毛製造的，品質低劣，一經拉試，即致斷裂，結果還那些具有錯誤的心理的人自己蒙受損失。</p>
<p>三，因爲一般人都以爲外國來的藥品一定比較好，於是中國藥廠的營業，大受打擊。在十月號的『讀者文摘』裏有一篇Quarantine　For　Dr.　Quack　說有不少美國的製藥商人，所出的出品不合標準，不能在美國市塲銷售，就把牠們出口到國外去。這可以給一般以爲祇要是外國來的東西，一定都是優美，精良的人以警吿。</p>
<p>爲了山國工業的前途，校正這種錯誤的心理，實在可以說是最急的要圖。</p>

<p>（六）創造力</p>
<p>創造力在做任何工作的時候，都是很重要的，因爲具有創造力，就可以使工作改進，這在企業組織方面，可以獲得相當利益，在職工方面，也可以得到升級的機會。</p>
<p>測騐方法：關於道個測騐方法，在國外是用十幾張一般人所知道的照片，（如上海的外灘：杭州的西湖或有名的人物等）在下面把各張照片的說明紛亂地註上，然後呌他去改正，這測騐的方法，同時可以看出被測騐者能否看出錯誤，一個沒有創造力量的人，對於一般事物是不會精細地去觀察的。</p>
<p>（七）做事的透澈</p>
<p>這和耐心和毅力是有相連的關係的，一個沒有耐心和毅力的人，決不能把事情做得很透澈。</p>
<p>測騐方法：可以呌被測騐者從下列的數字中，先從除去九字，再除去八字，再除去七字，照這樣順流下去，到二爲止。</p>
<p>457321485113478326528593764254931245845318</p>
<p>每次除去一個字後，可以把未曾除去的字寫下來，每除去一次，寫一次。</p>
<p>（八）敏捷</p>
<p>做事敏捷，可以促進工作的效能，一個頭腦淸楚的人，要受這個測騐，是沒有問題的</p>
<p>測驗方法：可以用塡句的方法，在規定時間之內塡好，試看他們的頭腦是否敏捷，這塡句的問題是很容易擬製的諸如：</p>
<p>甲，今天—和我到市鎭裏去。乙，一個人最需要的是——。</p>
<p>（九）管理的才能</p>
<p>關於管理的才能的測騐，是比較在雇用高級的職工的時候需用的，因爲低級的職工，尙不急切需要具有這種才能。</p>
<p>關於管理的才能的測騐，可以採用從十種測騐中的各種測騐所用的方法，加多問題，</p>
<p>（十）記憶力</p>
<p>記臆力在做事方面，是很重要的，一個記臆力强的人，對於自身也有莫大的便利，因爲做事可以事半而功倍。</p>
<p>測騐方法：可以用相速的數目字，呌被測騐者看一遍，然後默寫出來，看有沒有錯誤，諸如下列的數目是很相像的，非要記臆力强的人恐怕不能勝任。</p>
<p>7789　7878　34576　348576</p>
<p>在測騐的時候，可以採用考試的性質，把各種問題寫在一起，呌職工用筆答覆，如果要口頭詢問的，那末把問題編了號碼，然後把口試後的成績塡上去。</p>
<p>關於身體檢查，那末可以由醫師祖任，採用普通健康檢查的表格米應用。</p>

<p>— 戴望舒</p>
<p>幾日地，幾星期地，幾月地停止注意到自己，並不展顧。這就是穿隧道，穿過那裘就可以希望見到一片新的土地了……我常常害怕，一種太連續不斷的意識，會過於合理地把我們的未來成過去，會妨碍將來。祇有夜和睡眼容許變形；如果沒有蛹之中的遺忘，毛蟲是不會在覺醒時化成蝴蝶的。</p>
<p>這是巴萊思流行出來的。他的那種不停地在到處尋找一種敎訓，一種「功課」的需要—我覺得是不可忍受的。這是精神墮落的汚泥。那些偉大的作品祇在使我們沉面於一種差不多戀愛般的痳痺中的時候，纔使我們受到敎益。那些到處都尋找利益的人們，我將他們比之於在賣身體之前先問人「你給我多少？」的娼婦。</p>
<p>魚死的時候肚皮朝天而浮到水面：這是它們的倒斃方式。</p>
<p>見到有一些書，心裏總這樣想：誰會讀牠們呢？—見到有一些人：他們會讀些什麼書呢？……隨後這就勾結起來了。</p>
<p>趁着人們不注意的時候，栗樹的葉子開放出來了。每年都是同樣的意外，同樣地有受到意外的煩惱。春天踏着輕輕的脚步前來，像孩子們的聖誕老人一樣。我每次都重新想更警覺地伺候，守望它的來臨；但是，總還有一些神秘的，不可捉摸的東西在着。一時不去想它了；眼睛閉下去或是轉過去看一本書……抬起頭來：它已經在那裏了。</p>
<p>（無疑，那是因爲植物之生長的最大努力，是在夜間進行的。參有　思當丹的「熱帶自然界」的觀察和意見。）</p>
<p>風格的問題。人們由於無知，由於疏忽或山於大膽而犯罪。有些作家永不受到任何責難，但他們並不因此就是最好的作家。很少有人辭法正確而同時能顯得特殊。可是一切的推敲都是可憎的，情緒和思想的活動並不要求牠。很少的讀者能立刻了解這種要求的正式；大部份的讀者祇在那裏看到矯飾。思想平凡的人，並不感到有把思想不平凡地表現出來的必要。可是，一個作家祇有筆是大膽，這是最可憎也沒有了。</p>
<p>對於我，這些風格問題之失去最初的重要性，並不是十分長久的事。牠們之失去最初的重要性，並不是我覺得牠們是不大重要了；却是在我心頭，有其他的問題長大起來，現在達到了成年，趕上了前，而把其餘的曳在後面。讓牠這樣吧。</p>
<h3>從性心理——談藹理斯</h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>今晨偶然看到友人韋君拿着一部「性心理」，不覺聯想到該書的作者藹理斯來，於是就搜集些材料，談談這位支配人類思想的赫美洛克。藹理斯吧。</p>
<p>提起藹理斯，有些人總是聯想到「性」的問題。自然「性心理」是他的不朽傑作，是出版史上震撼一時的鉅著，對於英國傳統思想圍氛裏投下一顆大炸彈，四週八方，掀起了很火的騷動。他因此被捕到官署去。結果判決他「意圖破壞人民的道德」的罪名，這一部書，也被列入禁書之內，不准鈔印，傳播，閱讀。停留了幾十年，等到德文繹本和美國英文本先後川版了許久，英國才得開禁。</p>
<p>其實藹氏的著作，絕不只是一部「性心理」。他的寫作生活開始，是「康加河」，是在他卅一歲時所寫的，繼着是編纂「現代科學叢書」。「新精神」，是主張精神獨立說的著作，當巾已把性的重要原則指示川來。「犯罪論」，是用性心理學者的眼光來估計犯罪的原因，給意大利的研究犯罪學的人們，推崇備至。「男與女」，是「性心理」的前奏，雖沒有「性心理」所寫得的詳盡籲骨，但對於性心理的研究，也很透闢了。其後還有「聲辯錄」，「十九世紀」，「大不列顚天才之研究」，「西班牙之魂」，「印象和批評集」，「戀愛與貞德小品論集」，「今日的問題」，「從普魯士到　騷」等。談到他的「從普魯士到盧騷」，又使人想到他一九三四年出版的「懺悔錄」來了。他是一九三九年夏間去世。那麼「懺悔錄」的出版，似乎是他七十五歲以後的出版品，他對於一生作最後的自我批評和自白。</p>
<p>在第一次歐洲大戰時，他發表「戰時論文集」和「哲學的衝突」，可見他站在文藝家的地位對於國家和學術的貢獻，絕不作隔岸觀火。</p>
<p>有些人把藹理斯與中國「雙梅影閣叢書」的著者同一併論，這樣，他對於藹理斯的認識，不特過於隔膜，而且更沒有了解科學的性心理研究了。包括他的一切的哲學，藝術和思想的菁華，他還有一部偉大作品「生之舞」。近視的人把他當作唯性主義的敎主，未免看他不起吧。</p>
<p>藹理斯在一八五九年二月，生於英國，幼年跟着家長乘船環遊全球。他的學歷，是由文學轉人醫學，精通醫學之後，才埋頭著述。藹理斯和蕭伯納是同時同國，而個人是極要好的知己而好諧謔。蕭氏少年時，落魄困頓，鬱鬱不得志的十多年，賴藹氏的提携，在星期六報寫稿，蕭氏才漸漸出名。藹氏晚年寫「蕭伯納傳」，脫稿未幾即逝世。藹氏事先把稿交蕭氏整理付印，書中多深刻嘲諷語，如所引王爾德嘲蕭氏的話，「他一生沒有仇敵，也沒有一位十分要好的朋友」，這眞是一針見血之話，把蕭氏性格完全表露出來。蕭氏在藹氏原稿，除掉更正一些事實之外，其他沒有更改，只加了一篇「編後語」。而在「編後語」裏，也毫不留情的引王爾德嘲笑藹氏的話來報復，「藹埋斯，無論什麼王公權貴之門，都曾被邀赴宴過一次。」原來藹氏生平瀟　不覊，凡有赴宴，不管誰人在座，他不說話，英國人是看做有傷風化的。如和基督敎會的女執事同席，他便放縱的大談婦女的肉體曲綫美，把敎會女執事當作戰後的倫敦舞女。要是主人知道他的脾氣，使他和浪漫的女子隔座，他又大講耶穌人格的崇高偉大。所以人們請客，他只有「一次」（不敢有第二次領敎），就是如此，王爾德的批判，可謂實際的，謔而虐的了。</p>
<p>當藹氏着手寫之前，藹蕭氏曾寫信給蕭氏，蕭氏一時慌張起來，即寫信勸藹氏不要動筆。藹氏不肯。蕭氏知道無法勸阻，只得供給材料。等到全稿完成，藹氏把蕭氏的原信也一併發表，弄得蕭氏啼笑皆非。原來蕭氏雖幽默，而處世接物，却是異常謹愿，且是極守禮俗的英國紳士。藹氏呢，有時是放浪不覊，寫「王爾德傳」，夾着了不少描寫性慾文字。甚至他的懺悔錄裏，把個人生平浪沒猥褻的經過，繪影繪聲的宣洩出來。（蕭伯納的夫人因女傭看此書，把書燒燬。此事給藹氏知道，極看不起蕭夫人。蕭傳　對他也多不敬話。）試間蕭氏初聞着藹氏要替他作傳，怎得不驚恐呢？</p>
<p>藹氏是文人，而又富有天才，雖然不是蕭氏的崇拜者，却是蕭氏的知己知彼的畏友。所以在行文中，要挖苦即挖苦，想嘲弄即嘲弄，毫無拘束，用不着客氣與忌諱。故此書寫來，特別生動。使人讀了，津津有味，有諧謔，有　句，有骨氣，有深思，句句是心聲，是活的生的傳記，充分刻　蕭氏的裏而和內心。</p>

<h3>巴基的一封信</h3>
<p>— 任琦</p>
<p>匃加利的一位世界語作家Julio　Baghy的名字，因爲巴金譯過他的一本小說「秋天裏的春天」，在中國是不大生疏的，在第一次世界大戰巾他給俄國軍隊俘了去，俄國又發生了革命、他得經過冰天雪地而又赤俄白俄交戰着的西比利亞，被遣回國。他在這段歷程中的印象產生了兩部小說，一部是曾經由鍾憲民譯出的「犧牲者」，一部是好像還沒有人譯過的Sur　Sanga　Tero「在血染的地上」。第二次世界大戰中他怎樣了，一直沒有消息。現在知道了一點消息，那是今年年頭上他寫給瑞典世界語協會的一封信。下面便是這封信的譯文。</p>
<p>布達佩斯，一九四六，一月二日</p>
<p>幸福的新年！</p>
<p>就在恐怖過去之後，在我三個月的血中毒復原之後，我就坐在我的寫字樣前面，利用着自由，寫了一本四十頁（大型）的册子，宣傳我們的言語〔譯者按即指世Esperanto，下同〕和這言語在即將到來的一個新時期中的意義。自然這是用匈加利語寫的。接着我又爲我同國的人寫了一本很詳細的世界語文法。第一木書已經出版了，第二木正在印。此外我辦了幾個給預備傳授世界語的和新信徒學習的講習班，又在各學校，各工廠，火學裏，各城市裏去演講。這一切我在怎樣一種個人的景况下做了的我不願意訴說。只要提一提去年一年我沒有吃飽過四五次以上就够了。現在食養方面的情况愈加壞了，絕食的災難成脅着了。怎麼辦呢？好多萬人都在這同一的悄形之中，尤其像我一樣的沒有東西好變買的人。</p>
<p>在打仗的時候我的家遭了三次的搶刦，現在我在冬天幾乎沒有什麼衣着。我家裏的窗子都破了，燃料只在理論上是有的，而必需的食物甚至在理論上也沒有。我穿了一雙裏邊沒鞋子的舊套鞋怎麼能度過天寒地凍的季節眞是不知道…我們的貨幣價値的低落已經是透不過氣來的慘了。我可以這樣講，給你們去想：我的月薪（不是最壞的薪水！）只够買一又四分之一公斤的糖或是兩公升的油，假如我要買衣裳，至少要六個月薪水的總數纔够一件衣料。</p>
<p>現在我在民主組織的警察方面有了一個有薪給的職位，說得更確實些我是布達佩斯警察會的組織者和文化工作者，這個會是國家警察局的一個社會的敎育的組織。我的工作是眞優美的，雖則須要我日夜的緊張工作。在這個會裏剛成立了一個世界語部來團結世界語者的警察，敎育新的信使。已經有兩百多個警察加人講習班，這數目每天還要增加。假如國際和平建設的進步更爲有利的時候，這個部門一定要成爲我們的運動〔世界語運動—譯者〕在匈加利的最重要的組織之一。我請求你們，假如可能，替這新組織宣傳宣傳，寄些一書籍雜誌來，寫信來，把對於我們的事業有興趣的警察同人的通信處開得來。你們不能想像他們對於國外消息的渴望，他們對於從宣傳者方面我是從敎他們的我這方面所聽到的我們的言語的種種利益怎樣地想自己親身來經歷經歷</p>
<p>請把下面的吿白送登瑞典世界語報</p>
<p>「尤利，巴基，世界語學院副院長，衷心地向他的瑞典的男女朋友們致敬，並願他們新年如意。他很願接得他們的書信，到郵遞關係好轉之後，他將勉力回覆。可惜現在立即回覆殆不可能。地址：Budapest，Rottenbiller　u．66　Hungarlando.」</p>
<p>一九三三年時候消滅了的匈加利世界語者工人會已經從新成立了，開始活潑的宣傳了。可惜會員們每天都忙着一小塊麵包的奮鬥，所以整個運動還是停滯着，但是……但是我們沒有失去希望。我們彼此相遇的時候有一個敬語ESPERON〔希望〕！這個敬語漸漸地普遍了。餘外我請求你們向你們的會員們轉達我的同志的敬禮。</p>
<p>等待着你們的回信，再向你們敬禮！</p>
<p>你們的朋友　允利·巴基</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　103</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「勝利飲」。她嫣然媚笑着。（日倭自從對華用兵以來，許多飲食用品，部改了新名稱，取得吉祥兆頭的意思；別說鶴見聽了，莫名其妙；就連那些店家，茶座，酒樓的夥計們，都弄得頭　腦賬。）</p>
<p>從鶴見方面說，這十種局而，上海的人呌作「茄門」；北平土話呌作「抓了蝦」，或「抓了傢伙」，文字上面常用的，是一個「僵」字。請想，這種局面，到底算什麼？交際嗎？還是兵戎相見？還是同一陳綫的「打過門？」頭一步，這三種性質的態度就不易決定。要是不能決定性質態度的話，把敵人誤作朋友，或把自已人當作外人，一開口就要呌人瞧出底子。設若不管敵友，先祇管拿出交際的話頭來應付一下，固然可以行得，那除非料定對方大半是友的一方面，否則照規矩，對於敵人是應當先拿幾分顏色出來，打一個下馬威。不然的話，人家就要認爲你在示弱；至少要說你「漱」。</p>
<p>鶴見在這個「僵」的局面下，拿出無可奈何的看家本領——「汕」。這「汕」的方法，科學的術語，就是「游離」。好比一隻家狗看見一隻不火討　的野狗走來，在感情還沒有確定好與壞之前，牠必是在來狗的挨身週問，先繞一個　子，然後對準那不速之客的鼻尖，嗅上一嗅。這是狗的通常方式。至於人，那當然不能這們辦。</p>
<p>鶴見不是抽着烟捲的嗎？對的。他用一隻　請的手，大方面又藝術化的，從禮服馬夾袋內，搯出了一隻精緻的烟匣，很　　的姿式開了那烟匣，很禮貌的遞了過去。</p>
<p>中國三點會，好老會，袍哥會，等等江湖朋友，喝茶　烟，都有方式。門檻裏和門檻外，只在這一取茶碗，一拿烟捲的手式上，就可辨別出來。鶴見可不能用這一套方式；理由很多，最簡單的一條：在他未曾斷定對方是那個團社中的人物之前，他不能先把自己的行藏　露出來；因爲對方也是一個內行哩。</p>
<p>「謝謝。」她含着微笑，取了一隻，就着鶴見飛快的手式遞上的火，把烟吸燃了：「謝謝」，接着又是微微一笑，緊接部是把一雙黛眉，微微縐了一縐，完成了笑後的一顰。這一顰之後，却微微揚了揚那曾經用功化裝過的一雙眼皮，對着鶴見盈盈地瞧了一眼。這一瞧之中，充分含着怨懟的情感：</p>
<p>「鶴見君，」她又恢復了那自然的微笑，「您眞不感覺我的唐突嗎？」她悄語低聲地問着。</p>
<p>「我願意再度聲明，瑤駕的光臨，實在超過了我的禱祝之外！」鶴見好像一隻狗，在嗅着對方的鼻尖了，可還不曾脫去「油」的步驟。語句的字面上，確是相當客氣，而有禮貌。</p>
<p>「鶴見君！」她的話聲中，好像滲人一點嘆息的聲調，可仍舊含着微笑，「我們不能算是初次見面吧！」</p>
<p>這時恰巧妙所要的那個什麼「勝利飲」端了上來。究竟是什麼東西呢？原來是一大杯黃澄澄的流質，不大透明，英語的中國說法是「阿然子斯瓜西」，照歐化派從英漢大詞典禮找出的直譯是「橘子壓爛的流質。」</p>

<h3>人海</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>儘管航空進步，將世界的距離縮短，但人與人當中，還存在着種種的「牆」，使大家不能貼近，不能接觸。</p>
<p>就以這擁有四百萬人口的上海來說，也許祇需要一顆原子彈，便全部歸於烏有，可是就在這四百萬人口中，正不知產生了許許多多的悲離的故事。</p>
<p>你走在路上，恰巧在側轉頭看櫉窗裏一件羊毛衫，就在這一秒鐘內，你離別了十年而久所渴念的朋友，正從你身旁走過去，失之於交臂。這是一種例子。</p>
<p>其次，你過去的愛人或者女朋友，恰巧同在一家飯店裏碰到到，但是，不幸或是她旁邊有她的丈夫，或是你的妻子和你一淘，於是彼此祇有目述於心了。這也是一種例子。</p>
<p>芸芸衆生，茫茫人海，遇合幾乎成爲天降而不是人求的事。這往往就出現了傳奇，人因此被眩惑而感到自己渺小起來。</p>
<p>新聞資料</p>
<h3>何來巨蟒　竟打退坦克車</h3>
<p>— 黃接青</p>
<p>二十三日本報載有滇緬公路曾發現吞食軍人，不畏坦克車的八百歲巨蟒。</p>
<p>在神怪小說里，常可見到巨蟒大蛇的驚心動魄的故事。野史中的「白蛇故事」，也說得淋漓盡致。但道些大都出於虛構，不能令人相信；不料如今竟眞有奇怪的現實神話，出現於科學時代的今日。而且這巨蟒竟與今日權威武器坦克車相抗，吞食軍人，不畏槍彈，後來經美方以轟炸機擲了幾個巨彈，才結束了這希罕奇異的大蟒。這年頭，眞是咄咄怪事！</p>
<p>據說，關於此巨蟒，抗戰前即已有傳聞，但在戰爭期中，它也許深居叢林，故未發現；現在滇緬已不復烽火連天，所以滿不在乎地橫臥公路之上。</p>
<p>這一巨蟒，據報載，眞是其大無比，其厲害亦無比；究竟怎麼一回事，尙待生物學家的報吿。我們以爲：未必如電訊中所傳的那麼驚人。</p>
<p>這里，順便說些關于「蛇先生」的二三事：</p>
<p>原來蛇性喜潮濕溫暖，所以熱帶是產蛇最多的地方。蛇的種類，據一個名呌吉田平七郎的日本生物學者統計，共有二千六百餘種，其中毒蛇約佔三分之一·</p>
<p>我國西南諸省，尤以廣東西部和海南島產蛇較多，海南島的　蛇，長度常在十餘丈以上，身圍七八尺，能呑食人類與豺狼虎豹鹿　，這類　蛇的胆，大小恰如鴨蛋。</p>
<p>一九三四年，南美委內瑞拉岡海岸外的特林尼達島，曾發現長三十呎，有鱗的大蟒，當地土人稱這種巨蟒爲虎拉，它能生呑一條　魚。</p>
<p>民國二十五年三月十二日，我國連雲港曾發現長十餘丈，粗如巨甕，遍身紅黑斑爛的大蛇，經農民發現，鳴鼓攢擊，蛇遂逸去。北方出現如此巨蛇，確屬罕見。</p>
<p>不過蛇的可怕，並不在其身體巨大，而在其有毒，南美洲布母斯蘭格出產一種毒蛇，長祇一·四公尺，它在四十五分鐘內可以致死一頭牛。印度勒格可佈斯地方有長三·公尺的毒蛇，人類被它所咬，兩小時內即身亡，象鼻觸到它的毒液，不過三小時也要斃命。我國西康省有毒蛇一種，長祇一二寸，雙目炯炯有光，爬行很快，盤據山頂，遍設巢穴，山上雖盛產藥材，也無人敢去採取。</p>
<p>蛇類也喜自相殘殺，往往是巨蛇吞小蛇，但是也有小的毒蛇能將巨蟒嚙斃。</p>
<p>蛇肉可供食用，胆可製藥，皮可製鞋和錢袋之類，一身可謂能盡其用。不過殺食之前，須將毒齒拔去，吃蛇肉是廣東人特有的嗜好。</p>
<h3>順我者生　逆我者亡</h3>
<p>— 頑固</p>
<p>風風雨雨，是是非非，今日時局，眞是一團濃　。在霧中，大有文章可做：有人自己不參加國大，就咬住了參加國大的都違反人民意志，而與延安一致行動（也就是與延安有利）的，都是遵從民意。更進一步：不跟延安跑的，都是「賣友」，「變節」；反之，都是「堂堂風度的政治家」。一位外國記者自「解放區」同來後，說得好：「順我者生，逆我者亡！」</p>
<p>在這樣情形下，我想最好中國只能有一個黨——一個「革」掉無產階級之「命」的黨！</p>
<h3>戈林自殺的毒藥　靖化鉀</h3>
<p>— 麥葉</p>
<p>納粹第一號戰犯而生前愛好　章的戈林，終於在十月十穴日深夜，紐倫堡獄中執行絞刑前兩小時一刻鐘服劇毒自殺了。不是「將軍死在職塲」，也不够勇氣步上絞刑台前十三級短梯，戈林，他懦弱地偸服　化鉀自戕於監房，那個裝有毒藥的玻璃小管，是他最後一面「勳章」—這「勳章」據傳是藏在肚　的！</p>
<p>「　化鉀」是一種劇烈的毒藥，不久以前，日本第一號戰犯近衛文麿不是也在深夜裏吞服　化鉀而自殺了麼？　止「無獨有偶」，去年秋，還有一個納粹高級領袖在獄中偸服　化鉀而自殺，他是早就預備好的：把劇藥蔽在一個假金牙內。獄卒「三番五復」的施以身體檢查，自然查不出來，到頭來有一天，他把金壳兒取去，藥性一發，就「魂歸地獄」（天國沒有他的份兒啊！），一命嗚呼了！</p>
<p>是「以毒攻毒」麼，有毒的納粹思想的中毒者以劇毒來結束生命！</p>
<p>在普通化學實騐室裏，　化鉀算是一種最毒的毒藥。有人呌它做「靑砒」，實際上呢，「金瓶梅」所述潘金蓮聽了王婆敎唆而毒死武大時所用的「砒霜」（即「砷石」），萬萬不及　化鉀厲害。兩三年前轟動桂林的一件桃色案：男主角李某（化學系敎授）和化騐室裏一位女助手相好，後來他太太氣憤服毒而死。這男的在法庭上申辯說愛妻之自己誤吃毒藥而死，並非他用毒藥毒死她，其最有力的證明就在乎她之死是吃了氯化鋇，假如他存心置他死地，必用更毒最毒的　化鉀。這兩種藥在試騐室裏都有的。</p>
<p>化鉀是一種白色的粉狀結品，看起來和台灣一號白糖差不多，用鼻子嗅嗅似乎沒有什麼味，不過多噢了，就會頭腦暈眩而中毒。舌頭嘗起來有沒有味兒則不得而知，有人說有一股怪氣味，但一個人發覺那氣味兒不對時，他的命運已經站在人鬼之間「奈何河」上的「陰陽橋」了！　化鉀的利害處可舉這一例子來證明：筆者十二年前跟着一位老敎授在東京學習「法醫學」，那時東京正有這麼一件驚人的　化鉀案，行兇的是某吃茶店裏一個「吃茶女」（即女招待）的姘夫，受毒的是道情婦，男的偷偷把　化鉀放在一杯咖啡裏讓女的喝，她喝了一兩口，手裏那茶杯還沒有放回茶碟子上頭呢，她已經側身倒下死了。喝剩下來的有毒咖啡潑得滿身！</p>
<p>化鉀的化學分子式是KCN，它對許多許多金屬都有極強烈的合合力。它能溶解金條，銀塊，所以在「冶金」上有極大的用處。每天刋登「申報」上的銅圖或鋅版，在拍攝底片時也不能少了它。五金中最硬的鐵，而鐲又比鐵硬；鋼有多種，最硬的日「風鋼」，在煉鋼時都少不了　化鉀作硬化劑，一條鐵燒紅了祗要在　化鉀溶液中一沾，冷却後就硬了許多倍。　化鉀在農業上也有許多用途；而在化學分析中允爲不可暫缺。</p>
<p>化鉀之如此毒，就是因爲它與人體中血液裏的鐵質發生作用，血液遇到它，就立刻發生可怕的變化，照「法醫學」上說，　化鉀的中毒者是最容易檢查出來的，死者的皮膚因爲　化鉀與血液化合後，必定是呈露美麗的金黃色。順便一說，假如井中投有　化鉀中毒者的尸體，這個水井最好用泥塡平，永不使用。</p>
<p>什麼時候啊，但願弗朗哥之流的血液裏也沾一點　化鉀！</p>
<p>國外瑣聞</p>
<h3>世上最華貴的旅店</h3>
<p>— 郁強</p>
<p>有人說：祗要你有耐心在紐的的華爾道夫旅館的大門口候着，便不難看到全世界的大人物了</p>
<p>自華爾道夫旅館一洛成以來，它成了美國總統們的「紐約行轅」，羅斯福和杜魯門都曾下榻於此。今年曾來我國考察的胡佛，唯一活着的美國的卸任總統，更在這裏訂着一個長房間。</p>
<p>世界各國的皇帝，皇后，元首，首相，外交家，工商業巨頭……凡是路過紐約的，除了華爾道夫外，絕少借宿於別的旅館。蔣夫人，戴高樂，希臘王喬治五世，荷蘭女皇威廉明娜……都曾做過華爾道夫的座上客。如今，聯合國「奠都」紐約，華爾道夫不知又添了多少「世界安全製造者」的足跡。近日四强外長會議也是假座道裏舉行的，華爾道夫旅館大有與盧森堡宮一爭長短之慨</p>
<p>「不愛王位愛美人」的溫莎公爵訪問美國時，也曾寄寓此處。當時，他曾鬧了一個笑話：一次，他在華爾道夫旅館內，「迷途」了。最後，他終於找到了電梯入口處，便按鈴喚電梯。誰知這輛電梯是載貨的，但是溫莎公爵却滿不在乎的跨了進去，電梯駕駛員頗覺手足無措。天性放蕩的溫莎公爵這時已安然的坐在貨物箱上了。他對駕駛員說：「我們開吧。假如你不介意的話，我是無所謂的」。</p>
<p>在華爾道夫的奢華的尊榮的背面，每天發生着人類的悲劇和喜劇。男子和女子，在這裏跳舞，戀愛，仳離，死亡。去年，米高梅影片公司就曾以華爾道夫爲背景，攝製了一部「華爾道夫的週末」，描繪這裏的形形色色。</p>
<p>華爾道夫的房金，雖不如一般人所理想的那麼昂貴，但是也說不上便宜。一些特訂的窗麗的兩間到十間的套房，每天租金要一百二十元美金呢。</p>
<p>華爾道夫的廚房是世界聞名的，有「小型國際聯盟」之稱。大多數的廚頭，屠夫，調味廚子和糕餅廚子都是從件國禮聘來的。烹調廚子是義大利人，烘焙廚子則是澳洲人。磁器和銀器由葡萄牙人，菲律賓人和西班牙人分別管理。</p>
<p>魯歇斯布墨，華爾道夫的指導的靈魂，被公認爲是世界上最出色的旅館管理的權威。他管理着一萬名的服務員，絕不紊亂，絕不鬆懈。</p>
<h3>「退票」</h3>
<p>— 介生</p>
<p>十一日晚某大戲院演第四塲「鶯飛人間」，正演到將近結尾柳鶯被老師魯斯曲驅逐以後，片子忽然啞了，全塲頓時大譁，但不到一分鐘，即繼續演下去，片子又有了聲音，呌囂的觀衆道才安靜下來。</p>
<p>雖然「啞塲」時間只有僅僅不到一分鐘，這期間却無形中進行了個心理測騐：原來在片子「絕饗」之後，要叫的人先是怪聲的叫，接着就叫出名堂來了，甚—「退票！」「退票！」「退票！」</p>
<p>就在這啞塲之前柳鶯被魯斯曲驅逐時的對話中，柳鶯還說過這麼一句話：「他們眼睛裏只有錢！」不知道許多高叫「退票」的聽各們在高叫過後再想起了這麼一句話時，又有怎樣的回味。我不是替戲院老板說話，我只覺得這般人太喜歡「謔人取樂」，結果弄得公共秩序一塌胡塗！公共塲所的意外事故難免發生，而這　突出事件却正是對於公衆守秩精神的考騐！</p>
<h3>針鋒相對</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>橡皮釘子</p>
<p>一個魯莽和自負的編戲家，當他自己的劇作將上演的時候，寄了兩張演出的第一晚的戲票給市長。附帶一張條子說市長可以邀一個朋友，信上說：「假使你竟然還有一個朋友的話，可以邀來。』</p>
<p>市長用一封極謙虛的信退還了那兩張戲票，說是己有約在先了，所以不可能在演出的第一晚來觀劇，但是，他想買兩張第二天晚上的戲票，『假使那戲竟然還會做下去的話。」</p>
<p>孩子想法</p>
<p>一個母親敎導她的小兒子說二：「我們活在　界上是應該帮助別人的。』他將這句話考慮了許多時候，然後反問：「那麼別人活在世界上做什麼？」</p>

<p>在比基尼島試騎原子炸彈的時候，大家爭論着下一次戰爭中運用的是什麼武器—原子炸彈呢，細微菌呢，還是火箭彈。</p>

<p>禮尙往來</p>
<p>一個補魚爲業的漁夫，是素來以會說笑話著名的。有一天，一個肥胖的寡婦，恰巧路過那裏，便呌喊着问他：『喂，船主，人家吿訴我，你是一個此地赫赫有名的「說謀」者。』</p>

<h3>玫瑰酒與大衣</h3>
<p>— 建華</p>
<p>上海橫斷面</p>
<p>這一個極趣極的騙局，是這樣展開的：</p>
<p>友人陳君、家住天津路香粉弄，現在瀏河路某中學担任敎務，兩處相距不遠，陳君每晨必由西藏路到校，晚從原路回家，熟門熟路，天天是這樣往返的。</p>
<p>上星期五，陳君課罷回家，見臥室中所掛的新製大衣，已沒有了踪跡，因問正在準備晚餐的夫人，陳妻一經丈夫的詢問，驚詫地說；「奇了！大衣已給校工帶去了，說是你因怕旁晚寒冷，特地差遺他來帶去的；而且携回白玫瑰酒兩瓶，說你明日請客，預先購罷需用的。你看！桌上不是兩瓶白玫瑰嗎？」</p>
<p>陳君聽了他夫人的話，明知受騙。並悟這件大衣，在月初驟冷的時候，穿過兩次，想在路上已被騙子注目，跟踪偵悉了住址，假託校工來行騙無疑，至於携來的白玫瑰酒，要使家中人確信他爲校工，作爲釣魚的餌子的。襟懷豁達的陳君，想到這裏，不覺好笑起來，對他夫人說：「我們不可辜負了騙子的雅意，旣有好酒，明天請你略備數菜，當邀二三至交，來家小酌，未始不是趣事。」</p>
<p>屋六，陳君到校，向諸同事說：「辱承盜命，略備杯酒，今晚請諸君便飯，幸勿謝我。」同事莫明其妙，以爲笑談，直待陳君說出被騙情形以後，始引起了不少堂聲。</p>
<p>四時過後，陳君强拉了幾位好友，偕同回家，實行小酌。陳妻開門歡迎說：「騙案旣破，大衣帶回來否？」這話突如其來，足使陳君摸不着頭腦。陳妻急道：「今天下午一時左右，來一身穿制服的男人，自關係××分局派來，謂騙子已經捉到，但須帶回證物白玫瑰酒，以便嚴加究辦，听以把酒也交付來人了。」陳妻話未說畢，同事們已哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>爲了一件大衣，竟會一騙再騙，如開玩笑，聽明幹練的陳夫人，也會議不破當時的迷陣，大上其當，眞是騙術中的別開生面了。</p>

<h3>Planned List of Presidium Groupings, National Assembly Holds First General Meeting, Rules of Procedure to be the Focus of Discussion</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 24th) The first National Assembly is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 25th, following the Central Memorial Week, presided over by Chairman Chiang himself. In addition to various reports, the rules of procedure for the National Assembly and the general principles for the organization of various review committees will be discussed. It is expected that Article 18 of Chapter 4 of the former, which states "Drafting proposals based on the Organic Law of the National Assembly shall be limited to the formulation of the Constitution and the date of its implementation," will be hotly debated. The latter, regarding how representatives choose to participate in the review committees, will also take some time. Therefore, if the agenda cannot be completed before noon, the meeting will continue in the afternoon. Whether the third meeting of the Presidium will be convened on the 25th will depend on how late the General Meeting ends.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th) The National Assembly is scheduled to hold its first general meeting at 10:00 AM on the 25th. The Presidium will publicly elect Representative Chiang Kai-shek as Chairman. All representatives will stand in respect for the founding revolutionary martyrs, the soldiers who died in the War of Resistance, and the compatriots who perished. The tentative agenda for the meeting is as follows: (1) Reports: The Secretariat will report on various documents, and the Presidium will report on the grouping method of the Presidium and the rules for observing the National Assembly.

<h3>Willing to Maintain a Super-Partisan Position, Continue to Strive for Mediation, Democratic League Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 24th) The China Democratic League held a press conference at 2:30 PM on the 24th and issued the following written statement:</p>
<p>The purpose of the China Democratic League is to realize democracy in China. However, unity, unification, and peace are the prerequisites for the realization of democracy in the country. Therefore, since its establishment, the Democratic League has decided to stand in a third-party position and strive to mediate the military conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. A divided country, a country that continues to engage in civil war, cannot have democracy. This is our view in the past, and it is still our view today.</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference held in January of this year did indeed open up a clear and bright path for solving the country's problems. If the responsible ruling parties could have implemented the five resolutions based on the procedures determined by the Political Consultative Conference as soon as possible, we firmly believe that the situation in China would have improved earlier. Unfortunately, many opportunities for unity, unification, and peace have been missed in the past ten months.</p>
<p>From February of this year until today, the Democratic League has consistently adhered to two principles:</p>
<p>First, the Democratic League supports the Political Consultative Conference. Because the Democratic League is a participant in the Political Consultative Conference, we have an obligation to abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and at the same time, we have a responsibility to urge all parties to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are a kind of contract between the participating parties, which can also be said to be a kind of Magna Carta for China's pursuit of peace and democracy. The National Assembly must be formulated in accordance with the draft agreement. This explains the importance and dignity of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If any party participating in this contract can arbitrarily tear it up, then there can be no rule of law in China in the future, and even less constitutionalism and democracy.</p>
<p>Second, the Democratic League opposes civil war. The Democratic League is a political party without military force. The Democratic League firmly believes that whether the ruling or opposition parties possess military force, the country will not have peace, and it will never be able to embark on the right path of democracy. Moreover, all the people of China today unanimously oppose civil war. Therefore, for the past ten months, the Democratic League has always been a super-partisan and independent third party, striving to mediate the military conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. These two things are interrelated, because there must be peace in order to implement the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the faithful implementation of the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference is necessary to guarantee China's permanent peace. This explains the path and painstaking efforts of all the work of the Democratic League in the past ten months.</p>
<p>On October 21, the representatives of the Democratic League at the Political Consultative Conference accepted the invitation of the government representatives and came to Nanjing together with representatives of other parties at the Political Consultative Conference and social figures. All our efforts have never departed from the above two principles. On the one hand, we strive to implement the five resolutions in accordance with the procedures of the Political Consultative Conference, and on the other hand, we call for peace and seek to stop the party struggle with military force. Until the night of November 14, on the eve of the opening of the National Assembly, the so-called third party exhausted its efforts but still failed to save the time. At the same time, other parties and social figures could finally decide their own actions from their own positions. Only then did our Democratic League representatives reluctantly temporarily stop our mediation work. Our wisdom was insufficient, and we stopped when our strength was exhausted. This is a point that we hope the people of the country will understand.</p>
<p>The Democratic League refused to participate in the National Assembly held on November 15 for a very simple reason: the convening of the National Assembly this time violated the entire spirit of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, broke the procedures of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, and this National Assembly is not a constitutional conference for national unity and unification. This is a fact that is universally recognized. The Democratic League has repeatedly declared its support for the Political Consultative Conference, and has repeatedly declared that it will absolutely not participate in any actions that can strengthen division. The Democratic League should adhere to its promise today to gain the trust of the people of the country. The foundation of democratic constitutionalism is that all people in the country jointly legislate, and all people in the country abide by the law unanimously. There must first be the substance of joint legislation before the effect of unanimous law-abiding can be achieved. The formulation of the Constitution is a major undertaking of the country. The content of the Constitution is certainly important, but the legal basis for the institutions that produce the Constitution is even more important. The legal and illegal issues of the source of the basic law often cause long-term disputes and divisions in the country. There are many precedents in world history, and there are also many practical examples in the history of the Republic of China. We know that even if the Democratic League participates in the current National Assembly, it will not only fall into the error of destroying the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference itself, but it will not help the future constitutionalism, nor will it help the current national unity, unification, and peace. Therefore, we only have the path of remaining super-partisan to seek the peace of mind of our conscience.</p>
<p>This attitude of the Democratic League is by no means passive. In today's reality of Chinese politics, it is necessary to first seek the cessation of the military conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and then there will be peace. Only with peace can there be constitutionalism and democracy. From the standpoint of the common people, the people must first have the opportunity to survive before they can talk about the Constitution. It is necessary to first stop this cruel and inhumane civil war before the people can have the opportunity to survive. There are countless problems to be solved in China today, but the most urgent and important problem is to stop the military war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Our Democratic League clearly recognizes this major key, so we are willing to maintain the position of a super-partisan and independent third party in the civil war environment, and continue to strive for the greatest effort in mediating the military party struggle, in order to strive for the true peace of the country, promote the true unity of the country, establish the true constitutionalism of China, and realize the true democracy of China. November 24, 1946</p>
<h3>At the Democratic League's Reception for Journalists, a Wave of Sharp Inquiries, Answered Separately by Luo Longji and Others</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 24th) The Democratic League held a press conference at 3:30 PM on the 24th to report on the Democratic League's attitude towards the state of affairs. More than 100 journalists from various places in Nanjing attended. Luo Longji, Minister of Propaganda of the Democratic League, presided over the meeting. First, he read out a written statement, and then the journalists raised questions, which were answered separately by Luo Longji, Zhang Shenfu, and Zhang Bojun. The important points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What specific methods will the Democratic League use in the future to mediate the Kuomintang-Communist Party issue?</p>
<p>Answer: The Democratic League is still working hard to restore peace talks and stop the civil war. As for the method, it cannot be revealed.</p>
<p>Question: What is the Democratic League's attitude towards the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly?</p>
<p>Answer: The Democratic League has a regulation for adjusting party relations, the main point of which is that each unit that constitutes the Democratic League shall not independently and directly negotiate with the government. The Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly violates the regulations, so the Democratic League will deal with it accordingly.</p>
<p>Question: What is the Democratic League's view on the draft constitution?</p>
<p>Answer: We have two views: (1) We cannot recognize a constitution that is not completed by the Political Consultative Conference. This is discussed and studied by a minority of people. At the same time, the most important point, that the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, is not a clause of the Political Consultative Conference resolution, but was proposed by the government at that time. There are also some other parts for which the Democratic League reserves criticism.</p>
<p>Question: On November 11, the Democratic League, social figures, and the Youth Party held a meeting at Jiaotong Bank and decided to write to Chairman Chiang to request that the National Assembly be postponed to December 1, and declared that all those who signed would participate in the National Assembly. After Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, and others met with the Communist Party representatives, they temporarily removed the names they had signed. Is this true? And does it conflict with the Democratic League's super-partisan position?</p>
<p>Answer: This letter was proposed in the name of a group, signed by individuals, and declared that they would not participate in a non-unified National Assembly. This letter is now with Mo Dehui. Since it was signed in an individual capacity, individuals who are unwilling can of course withdraw. At that time, Zhang Shenfu immediately stood up and said: If the Kuomintang-Communist Party issue is not resolved, then all issues cannot be resolved. Each time the third party proposes a plan, it considers whether it can be approved by both parties. If it cannot be approved, it will only increase the difficulty of mediation and hurt the feelings of both parties. At that time, we discovered that the matter of writing to postpone the National Assembly was not appropriate, so we had to temporarily withdraw.</p>
<p>Question: What is the Democratic League's opinion on Zhang Junmai's exchange of letters with Chairman Chiang and Zhang Junmai's personal non-participation in the National Assembly?</p>
<p>Answer: This is an internal affair of the Democratic Socialist Party, and we do not want to make any criticism.</p>
<p>Question: The Democratic League claims that the convening of the National Assembly has no legal basis. What legal basis does the Political Consultative Conference resolution have?</p>
<p>Answer: The Political Consultative Conference resolution not only has a legal basis but is also a draft of a Magna Carta. Since the Political Consultative Conference resolution has been overturned, the National Assembly has no basis.</p>
<p>Question: In addition to the representatives of the Kuomintang, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and social figures, there are also people's representatives participating in this National Assembly. The so-called Constitution should be based on the public opinion of the masses. Please, when it comes to representing public opinion, should we value the National Assembly or the Democratic League's opinion?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no basis for saying which party represents more public opinion, and any country's constitution-making must take into account all aspects. If some people do not participate in the constitution-making, they can not recognize it.</p>
<p>Question: Since the Democratic League believes that the National Assembly is illegal, what does it indicate?</p>
<p>Answer: The Democratic League will not be bound by this kind of constitution.</p>
<p>Question: If there are hooligans, bandits, and a minority of people who have not participated in the constitution-making, are they not also bound by this constitution, and does the national law even exist? (At that time, there was an uproar in the audience, and Luo immediately gave a side answer)</p>
<p>Answer: When we were at the Political Consultative Conference, we were equal in status with the various parties. Hooligans and bandits are illegal people, so they cannot be compared.</p>
<p>Question: The Democratic Socialist Party has a total of 40 people participating in the National Assembly, which is one-third of the number of representatives of the Democratic League. However, it is heard that only 20 people from the Democratic Socialist Party participated in the Democratic League. How is this allocated?</p>
<p>Answer: This is given by the government. The press conference ended at about 4:00 PM. From beginning to end, the questioners were extremely enthusiastic and fierce. Luo also felt very inadequate when answering questions, and Zhang Shenfu and Zhang Bojun sometimes assisted him before he could finish the meeting.</p>
<h3>Draft Constitution to Be Submitted to National Assembly, Wang Chonghui Sorts Out Report Overnight, Wu Jingxiong Talks About Opinions on Revised Draft</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 24th) The amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China, after the Legislative Yuan has completed the legislative process and submitted it to the National Government, can be submitted to the National Assembly as the basis for constitution-making. Wang Chonghui, the original sorter of the case, has been drafting a report on the sorting process of the Constitution with Pu Xuefeng and Yang Zhonghu, advisors to the Supreme National Defense Council, in preparation for submitting it to the National Assembly. Wang and the other two worked all day yesterday, extending to 1:00 AM, and it is heard that all the work will be completed soon.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency Dispatch from this City) Dr. Wu Jingxiong, an authority on the Constitution, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last, stayed for a day, and returned to Nanjing by car last night. When the reporter visited Mr. Wu before his departure, he asked for his opinion on the revised draft of the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft Amendment. He said: The revised draft of the Constitution is no longer a Kuomintang constitution in terms of its content. Although its general structure has not deviated from the basic theory of the Five-Power Constitution, it has integrated many opinions from various parties, so it is actually a compromise constitution. The constitution takes the theory of the five-power constitution as the body, and the opinions of all parties on the constitution as the use. Looking at the entire constitution, it fully contains the spirit of democracy and the purpose of compromise. In short, the final constitution review committee had very harmonious opinions, and the objective needs were the basis, and its spirit actually surpassed that of party factions. Personally, I am very satisfied with all the chapters of the final revised draft, except that the powers of the National Assembly seem too narrow and should be expanded. I believe it is a constitution that can be implemented and is full of the spirit of democracy.</p>
<h3>Organic Law of the Control Yuan</h3>
<p>Amendment to Article 11</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th) The National Government issued an order on the 24th to announce the amendment to Article 11 of the Organic Law of the Control Yuan: "Amendment to Article 11 of the Organic Law of the Control Yuan": The Control Yuan shall have one Secretary-General, specially appointed.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] The newly appointed Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security, Ma Zhanshan, will go to Nanjing in the coming days to meet with Chairman Chiang to seek instructions on the Northeast issue. Chairman Chiang previously sent a telegram summoning Ma to the south, but Ma was unable to make the trip due to illness. Ma has now recovered.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Our reporter, Pu Dejie</p>
<p>— A Glimpse of the Day Before the First Plenary Session</p>
<p>Without meetings for two consecutive days, the National Assembly Hall appears quite deserted. A large number of taxis are lined up on the side of the road opposite the main gate. It is rare to see one moving, and even when they do, there are very few passengers inside. Moreover, they are all staff members. The representatives either have social engagements or have nothing to do. Some representatives are strolling the streets of Taiping Road, buying small items.</p>
<p>There is less automobile traffic in the Assembly Hall area, fewer people coming and going, and fewer police officers. Each one stands leisurely in the sun, occasionally waving a finger to direct one or two cars in and out, occasionally greeting one or two reporters who are trying to sneak into the venue to chase news, looking around, and saying "Sorry," completely without the tense appearance during the meetings. But what tomorrow will be like, no one can say.</p>
<p>Every seat in the venue is empty, every loudspeaker is covered with a purple-red cloth hat, the electric lights around the hall are on, but the fluorescent lights on the ceiling are not. Quietly, craftsmen are tidying up the total door curtains of the presidium offices and the National Government Chairman's rest room on both sides of the stage. Starting tomorrow, the two door curtains will be extremely busy.</p>
<p>The 24th is one of the National Assembly's only idle days. The staff of each department has the opportunity to rest. The ladies in the cloakroom are nowhere to be found. The ladies in the deliberation group are taking photos inside and outside the hall. The telephone operator is also sitting there chatting in Sichuan dialect. The Secretariat of the National Assembly will be established on the 25th. The Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee said that the handover would be handled on the 24th, but Secretary-General Hong is still Secretary-General Hong. There is really no handover to be done. It will be a matter of official seals starting on the 25th.</p>
<p>Someone said, "You news reporters are the most snobbish. Now that Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart are not leaving Nanjing, I'm afraid you won't look for them. Look, no one goes to the CCP office in Meiyuan, and no one goes to the Youth Party office in Fengyi Village. Today, they found the Democratic League again." Indeed, the only news event on the 24th was the Democratic League's reception for reporters, which was a major event. In Room No. 1 upstairs at the Longmen Restaurant, smoke was swirling, and heads were crowded together. The reporters were all inside and out, questions chasing one after another, one tighter than the other. Even a good orator like Luo Longji seemed unable to handle it.</p>
<p>The news reporters have nothing to do. In the afternoon, they listen to the Democratic League's declaration, watch the Social Democratic Party report, put together the names and faces of the Social Democratic representatives, and then run to Liuhuachun together. The Nanjing City Journalists Association hosts a banquet to entertain colleagues from various places who are attending the National Assembly to cover the event.</p>
<p>The National Assembly will officially begin on the 25th. The "National Assembly Daily," hosted by Hu Chunbing, will also be published on that day. The format is a four-page sheet, divided into four pages. In addition to the Assembly Communiqué news, the content will mainly consist of various reference materials.

<p>The Journalists Association's evening banquet was held in the hall of Liuhuachun. A large piece of red satin was covered with signatures. A large cafeteria was filled with guests, talking and laughing, applause rising and falling, followed by "Five Kings" and "Eight Immortals," with thumb-wrestling everywhere. Those who could drink were holding a wine pot in one hand and a wine glass in the other, going on expeditions to the east and west. The ladies could not help but drink, their faces red. The foreign friends also said "Four Seasons Wealth" and "Full Fortune and Longevity." By the time the banquet ended, everyone was still in high spirits, as if they had drunk someone's wedding wine. The boss of Liuhuachun said, "There are really a lot of people today. This kind of excitement is the first time I've seen it since the victory." (End)</p>

<h3>Ten Legislators Discuss the Draft Amendment to the Constitution (3)</h3>
<p>— Our reporter, Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>Presidential System? New Presidential System?</p>
<p>The article that received the most attention from the legislators during this review of the draft constitution was Article 56 (Article 58 of the Draft Amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China), which was drafted according to the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. It raises the question of the Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan. According to the provisions of this article, "If the Legislative Yuan does not approve of the important policies of the Executive Yuan, it may resolve to request the Executive Yuan to change it. The Executive Yuan may, with the approval of the President, request the Legislative Yuan to reconsider the resolution. If two-thirds of the attending legislators uphold the original resolution during the reconsideration, the Premier of the Executive Yuan shall accept the resolution or resign." The draft constitution also has similar provisions for laws passed by the Legislative Yuan. Such clauses did not exist in the original draft constitution. When Mr. Wang Chonghui explained the matter at the Legislative Yuan's review committee, he stated: The Second Plenary Session of the KMT raised serious doubts about this point. There has also been much discussion from outside. In fact, this provision does not necessarily have to be described wholesale as a presidential system or a cabinet system. There is no power of no-confidence, and the Executive Yuan has no power to dissolve the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, it differs from the cabinet systems in England and France. At the same time, there is also the provision that "the Premier of the Executive Yuan shall accept the resolution or resign." This is not the case in Greece, which adopts a presidential system, and it is also an improvement over the presidential system. After the Premier of the Executive Yuan resigns, the President can select a new Premier of the Executive Yuan to consult with the court. In this way, there can be more room for maneuver, and the President does not have to directly clash with the Legislative Yuan. In the United States, conflicts between the President and Congress often lead to delays in government affairs, but the new draft constitution has "a provision that two-thirds of the legislators uphold the original resolution," which allows for room for consultation. Mr. Wang described this system as a new presidential system.</p>
<p>Wu Jingxiong, the original drafter of the May 5th Constitution, believes that this system is still a presidential system, but at the same time, it has the meaning of a cabinet system. This is because the cabinet system has two characteristics: (1) Cabinet members are produced from among the parliamentarians, and (2) the parliament has the power of no-confidence in the cabinet. The new draft constitution is different from this. The Premier of the Executive Yuan is nominated by the President, and the Legislative Yuan only has the power to agree, which is the same as the presidential system in the United States. If the Executive Yuan expresses dissatisfaction with the constitution formulated by the Legislative Yuan, it can be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration with the approval of the President. If two-thirds of the legislators do not uphold the original resolution, it must be revised, which is also proof of the emphasis on the presidential system.</p>
<p>Most legislators expressed satisfaction with this provision. Li Qing said that the mutual restraint of the executive and legislative branches is a progress in the new constitution, because there is neither the autocracy of the president nor the autocracy of the party. If the parliament is dissolved from time to time, the election will be a waste of time. Even in a small island like England, it takes three months to hold a general election. Given the size of China, it is feared that it will take more than three years to hold an election, which is not realistically permissible.</p>
<p>Zhong Tianxin agreed with Wang Chonghui's explanation, believing that the new draft constitution is a new presidential system. This is because Article 56 stipulates that the Executive Yuan is only responsible to the Legislative Yuan in three situations (first, second, and third paragraphs). Therefore, it is only a limited responsibility, not everything like in a cabinet system. He also pointed out that the original draft constitution also had various restrictions on the Executive Yuan. The only difference is that one has a time limit, and the other has no time limit. Zhong believes that the legislation in the new draft constitution has considerable control over executive policy. In view of the fact that the Legislative Yuan could not implement checks and balances on the Executive Yuan in the past, the new regulations are indeed necessary. As for the Premier of the Executive Yuan resigning if he does not accept the resolution of the Legislative Yuan, the original draft constitution also had this intention.</p>
<p>Zhong also believes that, according to the national conditions, our country is not suitable for implementing a cabinet system. The implementation of this system requires a prerequisite, namely "citizen-oriented," which we do not have. The cabinet system was successfully implemented in the United Kingdom, but it failed in France. The reason lies in this. Furthermore, China is a democratic republic, and the new President will be elected by popular vote. At the same time, adopting a cabinet system is contrary to human nature.</p>
<p>Another supporter is Mr. Chen Xiaocen. Chen believes that the provisions of the new draft constitution are a way to transition from autocracy to democracy. If the public opinion organ has no power over the Executive Yuan, then what is the value of having power? However, the frequent overthrow of cabinets in France is also a warning to us. China's current situation requires stability. If the government has the mentality of living one day at a time, how can the country be established? The new draft constitution has flexible regulations, which are more progressive. Zhang Zhaoyuan also believes that the new system is progressive, but believes that it is not necessary to call it a cabinet system or a presidential system. Those who oppose this system include Chen Guyuan and Chen Changheng. Chen Guyuan believes that the executive being responsible to the legislature will confuse political power and governing power. Chen Changheng believes that every discussion of the law may lead to disputes, and it may be difficult to implement Article 56. At least "resignation" does not need to be stipulated in the constitution. As for responsibility, the Executive Yuan is directly responsible to the President and indirectly responsible to the Legislative Yuan. It does not seem appropriate to be responsible to the legislature. He believes that paragraphs two and three can be retained, but words such as "the Premier of the Executive Yuan resigns" should be deleted.</p>
<p>Power of Consent and the Five-Power Theory</p>
<p>On the theory of "checks and balances," another issue that caused a great uproar was the issue of the power of consent. Generally, it is believed that having the power of consent means destroying the five-power system. In addition to the "disapproval" resolution that the Legislative Yuan can make on the important policies of the Executive Yuan mentioned above, the constitution also involves the power of consent in Article 55 (Article 56 of the Draft Amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China) "The Premier of the Executive Yuan is nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan"; Article 82 (Article 83 of the same) "The Judicial Yuan shall have one President and several Grand Justices, who shall be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan"; Article 88 (Article 89 of the same) "The Examination Yuan shall have several members of the Examination Committee, who shall be nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan"; Article 94 (Article 95 of the same) "The Control Yuan is the highest control organ of the country, exercising the power of consent, impeachment, and supervision." All of these are stipulated according to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>Zhong Tianxin's explanation of the power of consent is the most exquisite. Zhong believes that after the Legislative Yuan and others have the power of consent, it cannot be considered that the executive power will be restricted, thus losing its independence, and further believes that the new system is a cabinet system that destroys the five-power system. Zhong especially pointed out that there is also the power of consent under the presidential system. For example, the appointment of the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Army, and Secretary of the Navy by the President of the United States must be approved by Congress. This is the example. The scope of power in our country cannot be compared with that of the United States. Zhong believes that it is necessary to adopt the power of consent system according to our country's national conditions. The concept of appointing private individuals in our country is very deep. If party politics are developed, the trend of appointing people from the same party will be prevalent, which can be restricted after this.</p>
<p>Chen Changheng made a further view, believing that important appointments, at least the President and Vice President, should not be appointed by the Legislative or Control Yuan, but should be submitted to the National Assembly for approval.</p>
<p>Central and Local, Province and County</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference made four provisions for the relationship between the central and local governments: (1) Determining the province as the highest unit of local autonomy; (2) The division of powers between the province and the central government shall be stipulated in accordance with the principle of equitable distribution of powers; (3) Provincial governors shall be elected by the people; (4) Provinces may formulate provincial constitutions (later changed to autonomous laws), but they must not conflict with the national constitution. The new draft constitution has adopted the above resolutions.</p>
<p>Legislator Di Ying also strongly opposed this point when speaking in the Legislative Yuan before, believing that this fact violated the Premier's will. "The county is the unit of autonomy" is the Premier's most important proposition for saving China. Now, canceling this article will increase the trend of separatism. Chen Guyuan believes that it is good to list the powers of the central and local governments separately, but after the province becomes an autonomous unit, it will easily become a separatist situation. Chen Xiaocen adopted a compromise view, believing that in our country's history, a large local power will lead to division, and a small local power will be undemocratic. The new draft constitution stipulates very well and can be tried out. However, it is believed that it is more in line with the national conditions for the county to be the unit of self-governance. Some people suggest reducing the provincial area, which may also be a way. Chen Changheng believes that the province can formulate autonomous laws, but in addition to not conflicting with the constitution, the phrase "not conflicting with central laws" should be added.</p>
<p>Zhang Yuan believes that it is a progress to change the province, which used to be a "transition from the top to the bottom," into an autonomous unit. Since the province is an autonomous unit, it should have autonomous laws to adapt to local conditions according to the different political conditions of each province, without violating the central laws. Li Qing also made the same view, believing that the conditions of each province are different. National policies should be determined by the central government, and matters that are suitable for local conditions should be delegated to the local government as much as possible. The original draft constitution was too lax on this point, and the new draft constitution is more progressive. Regarding the point of "provincial governors being elected by the people," the original constitution stipulated that they should be appointed by the central government. This was to adapt to the situation and cannot be permanent.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point that should be stated: Wang Chonghui and others proposed the following provisions for the rights shared by the central and local governments: "The following matters shall be legislated and implemented by the central government, or delegated to the province for implementation." The final revised version of the constitution draft review committee added the word "county" under the word "province" and added "General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy" in the first paragraph. This is a more flexible approach. (End)</p>
<h3>29 Catholic Faithful Martyred in the Boxer Rebellion Listed as "Blessed," the Canonization Ceremony Will be Presided Over by the Pope Himself</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Twenty-nine martyred clergy and faithful of the Catholic Church were canonized as "Blessed" at 6:00 PM on the 24th. The canonization ceremony will be presided over by the Pope himself and will be solemnly held in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Among the 29 people, there were 15 European missionaries and 14 Chinese clergy and faithful, all of whom sacrificed in the Boxer Rebellion in July 1900. The places of martyrdom were near Hengyang and Taiyuan. When Archbishop Gan Bin announced the news during the Sunday Mass ceremony this morning, he said: Today is one of the most glorious days after China's victory. The holy martyrs are the practitioners who love God above all things. The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the faithful. He also encouraged the faithful to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs, cultivate their minds and nature, build virtue and establish merit, in order to cooperate with the nation-building work. At the end, Yu said: During the Boxer Rebellion, a total of 2,418 people died for their faith in Catholicism. Today's canonization of 29 people is the first batch selected from among them. He also said: Compared with six years ago, the number of Catholics has increased from more than 600,000 to more than 4 million, the number of middle schools has increased from one to more than 200, and three universities have also been established. According to the Catholic canonization, there are three levels: the first level is "Venerable," the second level is "Blessed," and the third level is "Saint." If there are two miraculous manifestations of those listed as "Blessed," they can be elevated to the status of saint.</p>

<h3>Impacted by American Goods Dumping, Hong Kong Factories Close Down One After Another; Rising Unemployment Becomes a Serious Issue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 24th] Hong Kong's industry is facing a serious crisis due to the dumping of American goods. In the textile industry, the government's ban on the export of yarn and cotton fabrics has led to a stockpile of hundreds of thousands of yards of fabric, which cannot be sold. Most factories have announced shutdowns. The rubber manufacturing industry, which once flourished after the war, has recently seen a reduction in domestic and foreign sales. Several small-scale factories have already closed down. The output of match factories is not as cheap and high-quality as American goods, and sales in Hong Kong are obstructed. The Southeast Asian market has also lost most of its share, so it is almost at a standstill. Due to the economic downturn in industry, factories are closing down one after another, and the number of unemployed people is increasing, which has become a serious problem in Hong Kong today.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Starting with the Participation of the Democratic Socialist Party in the National Assembly</h3>
<p>The National Assembly opened on the 15th, and a week has suddenly passed. The issue of the presidium's personnel selection and the agenda have both been decided in the past week. Today's first general assembly has moved from the preparatory meeting to the formal opening stage. At the same time, the foundation of the National Assembly is also expanding day by day. Social elites and the Youth Party advocated in the past and first put forward a list of representatives to participate in the National Assembly. Now, forty representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party also reported yesterday afternoon, and all will attend the first general assembly today, making this National Assembly a truly inclusive forum for various opinions, which is the most gratifying phenomenon in the current open political situation. This is certainly due to the wise decision of Zhang Junmai, the leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, but it is still impossible not to attribute it to the government's selfless spirit. The CCP has always maintained an uncompromising attitude towards the convening of the National Assembly. First, it tried every means to obstruct the opening of the National Assembly; later, it tried every means to undermine the constitutional work of the National Assembly. However, the government has endured and conceded again and again, even to the point of "enduring what others cannot endure and conceding what others cannot concede." It still retains its representative quota and opens the door of the National Assembly, sincerely hoping that the CCP can come to its senses and participate in the constitutional work of the National Assembly. It is a powerful guarantee for Chinese politics to embark on democracy and the rule of law that the Kuomintang, as a ruling party in power, has such a "public spirit for all."</p>
<p>However, the CCP insisted on saying about the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly: "This is just the Democratic Socialist Party helping the Kuomintang to thoroughly destroy the Political Consultative Conference." Then it said: "After the Democratic Socialist Party participated in the National Assembly, it did not change the monopolistic nature of the National Assembly by one party." No one can believe the CCP spokesman's nonsense, and there is no value in arguing. The CCP's attempt to undermine the constitutional work of the National Assembly is obvious; this style of persistence will eventually lead to the alienation of the masses. The CCP's stubbornness and refusal to participate in the National Assembly is tantamount to abandoning itself and cutting itself off from the people of the country. We really feel sorry for it. The CCP is not short of high-minded people, so why must it take such a bad strategy? It is really puzzling.</p>
<p>We originally thought that the Democratic Socialist Party's decision to participate in the National Assembly and the publication of the letters exchanged between its leader Zhang Junmai and Chairman Chiang would definitely move other leaders of the Democratic League, and following the Democratic Socialist Party, participate in the constitutional work of the National Assembly. However, after reading the written statement issued by the Democratic League yesterday, clarifying the Democratic League's attitude towards the National Assembly, there are two main points: (1) According to the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, the Democratic League insisted on "the National Congress should be convened in accordance with the agreed steps, and the constitution should be formulated in accordance with the agreed draft," so it refused to participate in the National Assembly. (2) It opposes civil war and believes that "in today's Chinese political reality, the two parties of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must first seek a cessation of armed conflict, and then there will be peace; only with peace can there be constitutional government and democracy." Therefore, the Democratic League will continue to maintain its independent status. We cannot help but feel sorry for the Democratic League. The Democratic League has always regarded itself as a third party, and still claims to be in a detached position. Why is it willing to echo the CCP's views and refuse to participate in the National Assembly? It is really too disappointing. Therefore, we still want to ask the leaders of the Democratic League to think again.</p>
<p>First, the Democratic League stated that the two principles it adheres to are to protect the Political Consultative Conference and to oppose civil war. After reading the letter from Zhang Junmai, the leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, to Chairman Chiang, its main idea is also the same. Moreover, it put forward concrete plans on how to implement the ceasefire order and how to realize the Political Consultative Conference resolution, which is even more urgent than the Democratic League's desire for peace and democracy. However, after Chairman Chiang replied that he adopted its proposal, the Democratic Socialist Party submitted a list of forty representatives, who reported yesterday and formally attended the National Assembly from today. Why can't the Democratic League participate? Is there another difficulty?</p>
<p>Second, the Democratic League calls the Political Consultative Conference resolution the "Great Charter," but considers the National Assembly convened this time to have "violated the entire spirit of the Political Consultative Conference resolution, destroyed the procedures of the Political Consultative Conference resolution, and is not a constitutional conference for national unity." This tune of blindly echoing the CCP only shows that the Democratic League's attitude has not been detached, and it still cannot clearly distinguish between right and wrong, which is a loss of its position. It is very clear that the Political Consultative Conference resolution cannot be regarded as a "constitution draft" in legal terms, because we pointed out at the time that the nature of the Political Consultative Conference was a political measure to resolve party disputes, only to enable all parties to exchange opinions and reach a common conclusion. Therefore, the Political Consultative Conference resolution does not involve law at all, let alone calling it a "charter"! However, the reason why all parties respect the Political Consultative Conference resolution is due to the political responsibility borne by all parties. Before the opening of the National Assembly, Chairman Chiang repeatedly solemnly stated that the government was determined to abide by the Political Consultative Conference resolution and ensure its implementation. After the opening of the National Assembly, the draft amendment to the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft, which was drafted in accordance with the Political Consultative Conference resolution, was also passed by the Legislative Yuan. At the same time, the Central Standing Committee and the National Defense Supreme Committee of the Kuomintang recently passed the amendments to the National Government Organization Law and the Executive Yuan Organization Law, fully demonstrating the spirit of abiding by the Political Consultative Conference resolution.</p>
<p>Third, a new political style of respecting each other and being incompatible with each other has been created by the convening of the National Assembly, especially the government authorities, who are showing the spirit of doing their best. The parties that shout slogans such as peace and democracy are often not truly peace-loving and democratic parties; the CCP touts the Political Consultative Conference resolution everywhere, but in practice, it is just "empty talk." At present, the government is the one that truly abides by the Political Consultative Conference resolution. Please see the following facts. (1) The government also knows that "there must be peace before there can be constitutional government." Before the opening of the National Assembly, it had already automatically and unconditionally issued a ceasefire order. If the CCP can put the country first and truly desire peace and democracy, the domestic conflict can be stopped immediately. So where should the responsibility for the failure to stop the war be attributed? It goes without saying. (2) The government is eager to convene the National Assembly, not because it holds power and refuses to let go, but to end political tutelage as soon as possible and return power to the people. At the same time, after the Chinese National Assembly formulates a practical and feasible democratic constitution, it can enter the normal track of constitutional government. There is no reason for any party to oppose this intention of the government. (3) The only task of this National Assembly is to formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution. The Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft is inevitably out of touch with the times due to the long time interval. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan has also passed an amendment to the constitution draft in accordance with the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference resolution. No matter from which angle it is observed, the government's measures not only fully demonstrate the spirit of abiding by the Political Consultative Conference resolution, but also demonstrate the government's progressive spirit. (4) During the National Assembly session, the government also automatically carried out the work of reorganizing the National Government and the Executive Yuan. The amendments to the National Government and Executive Yuan Organization Law passed by the Central Standing Committee and the National Defense Committee are also based on the Political Consultative Conference resolution. Once the National Assembly closes, the reorganization of the government can be fully realized.</p>
<p>In short, since the Democratic Socialist Party is a member of the Democratic League, its views are also the views of the Democratic League. In fact, after reading the letter from Zhang Junmai to Chairman Chiang and the written statement issued by the Democratic League yesterday, it is not difficult to understand that the views of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Democratic League are completely consistent. Forty of the 120 representatives of the Democratic League have participated in the National Assembly. Why do the remaining 80 still refuse to participate? Since the Democratic League opposes political parties resolving problems on the battlefield, it should participate in this forum that encompasses various opinions, integrating various good opinions, compromising to the right, in order to seek a reasonable solution to various problems. This is the only wide road to make Chinese politics embark on democracy and peace.</p>
<h3>The Coal Mine Strike in the United States</h3>
<p>American coal miners recently went on strike because their demands for higher wages were not fully met. According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 22nd, the president of the Mine Workers Union, Lewis, remains extremely firm and determined to fight for a legitimate strike. The court has issued a summons. If Lewis orders the miners to return to work before the 25th, he can avoid punishment; otherwise, he will be tried on the morning of the 27th. At the same time, various government departments have taken emergency measures to suspend freight transport and implement power conservation. The Director of the Civilian Production Administration, Small, warned that the lack of coal would devastate the national economy. The seriousness of the general situation can be imagined.</p>
<p>The United States is the most highly industrialized country in the world. Coal is the force that drives all industries and is an indispensable necessity for the people's lives. This strike by 400,000 coal miners will undoubtedly be the biggest blow to the country's economic life. Moreover, the coal miners' union is the key to other unions. An increase in coal miners' wages often leads other workers to make the same demands. The US government does not dare to agree easily, fearing that it will incite nationwide industrial unrest. In fact, the coal miners' request for an additional two dollars a day and improvements in other benefits are not too harsh. However, once the strike wind starts, the government will be unable to control it in the future every time it succumbs. Since May of this year, the US federal government has directly managed the coal industry through the Department of the Interior because there have been too many coal miner strikes, which have affected the national economy. If this strike cannot be quelled, it will prove the incompetence of the federal government.</p>
<p>According to the current situation, both sides are going to extremes. The government is determined to adopt a policy of oppression, and the union is determined to fight for the right to control. The court's threat to Lewis is unlikely to have much effect, because as the leader of the union, Lewis will not be afraid of personal sacrifice. Moreover, since the Republican Party's election victory, President Truman's cancellation of price controls, and workers' wages are not enough to maintain a life that keeps up with rising prices, it is also the truth. If the government insists on its own way, engages in oppression, and does not change the lives of workers from the root, I am afraid that more adverse effects will occur. As for the workers, regardless of the economic life of the people of the country, strikes at every turn, and holding them for a long time will also be subject to the accusations of the people of the country. Only if both sides make concessions can this storm be calmed.</p>
<p>From an international perspective, if this strike is not resolved as soon as possible, the whole world will suffer disaster. After World War II, the United States was the only country with perfect industrial equipment and was not destroyed by the war. The United States is not only able to produce enough finished products and materials for the lives of its own people, but also has a surplus to relieve the suffering people of the world and help countries gradually restore their pre-war economic life. The United States has contributed 2.7 billion US dollars to the United Relief Agency, and loans to various countries have reached 15 billion US dollars so far. These large donations and loaned US dollars are actually not banknotes, but the surplus materials of the United States. If the United States' domestic industry is devastated, the whole world will not receive relief, and the loaned and about-to-be-loaned funds will be equal to waste paper.</p>
<p>The world's economy is now interdependent. US Senator Thomas believes that only when the economies of all countries in the world prosper can the US economy prosper. Conversely, if the US economy is hit, the world's economy will also be hit. The impact of this strike is the most obvious, because once the United States is short of fuel, American finished products and materials cannot be exported in large quantities, and even after-war relief will become a problem.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the end of the war, the whole world has been experiencing a coal shortage. For example, the Ruhr area of Germany could export 31 million tons to foreign countries annually before the war in addition to its own use, but this year it can only export 13 million tons. The Soviet Union's coal production is only 50% of that before the war, so of course there is no export. Europe needs 38.5 million tons of coal, and it can only produce 72% itself. Imports from the United States and the United Kingdom only account for 6%, leaving a shortfall of 22%. However, the 22 million tons of coal that the United States exported to Europe already represents 5% of the total production of the United States. Before the war, the United States only exported 3% to Europe. Europe is still eager for the United States to increase production and export a large amount to relieve the European coal shortage.</p>
<p>From all aspects, this strike by American coal miners is very serious. If this is not handled properly and multiple strikes continue to brew, the serious threat will still not be lifted. We hope that the US government authorities and the president of the United Mine Workers of America, Lewis, will think from a big picture perspective and not insist on their own opinions.</p>

<h3>Wuhu Scoundrels Cannot Escape the Law; Thirty-Three Traitors Wanted; Suzhou High Procuratorate Office Warrants Three Puppet Tax Officials</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Wuhu] The Third Branch of the Wuhu High Court still has hundreds of traitors detained who have not been tried. Therefore, the cases involved are also widespread, and major traitors have taken advantage of the chaos to transfer their positions in many ways, and even changed their names, posing as those from the rear, doing their business greatly and living a prosperous life. Recently, the High Court issued an arrest warrant for a group of Wuhu fugitive traitors, totaling thirty-three people, most of whom are important figures with heinous crimes known to the people of Anhui. They include: Li Long, chairman of the puppet Wuhu Chamber of Commerce; Cai Gongyi, general manager of the puppet Yuhua Alliance Company; Cai Yongmei, chairman of the puppet Yangzi Company; Tao Xifen, translator of the Japanese Consulate; Da Shaoguang, chairman of the puppet Wuhu No-Goods Association; Liu Zijing, captain of the puppet Wuhu Security Brigade; Liu Fanghua, compradore of the Japanese Dry Goods Store; Zhou Jingchun, chief of the Japanese Military Transportation Corps; Zhou Zhikuan, head of the secret service of the Japanese Military Police Headquarters; Jiang Jiakuan, secret agent of the Japanese Military Headquarters; Tao Bangdong, captain of the puppet People's Self-Defense Brigade; Zhan Shan, head of the puppet Fifth District; Ling Shunqi, captain of the puppet Wuhu Sixth Security Team; Tao Tiehua, captain of the Qingshuihe Enemy Reconnaissance Team; Xia Yingzhou, captain of the puppet Wuhu Security Eighth Squadron; Xue Jianmin, captain of the puppet Wuhu Yitai Township Second Team; Zhai Dazhi, head of the puppet Wuhu Second District; Zhang Qijin, director of the puppet Huangchi Cooperative; Hong Jiuwen, secretary of the puppet Wuhu County Government and magistrate of Dangtu County; Huang Dezhi, head of the puppet Fanchang Three Township Self-Defense Regiment; Zhu Dexian, employee of the Japanese Foreign Firm; Hong Xinhua, chief of the first battalion of special agents of Lin Nisheng; Xie Yulin, director of the puppet Anhui Provincial Department of Education; Fang Jiwen, purchasing agent of the puppet Central China Transportation Company; Meng Xiangyi, purchasing agent of the enemy Mitsubishi Company; Chen Bu, director of the puppet Wuhu Cooperative Warehouse; Liu Zizhu, director of the puppet Money Industry; Zhang Silang, magistrate of the puppet Dangtu County; Zhang Zhu Hongzhen, a female traitor who forced her husband Zhang Zong to serve as the captain of the puppet Security Regiment; Zhang Xingcai, director of the puppet Dangtu Relief Home; Zhou Chengde, section chief of the puppet Dangtu County Government; Zhan Jiawang, secret agent of the enemy Wuhu Gendarmerie; and Zhou Fengchi, head of the puppet Wuhu Baisha Township.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Suzhou] Wu Ni Xiangguang, the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Income Tax Bureau Director, Wang Ni Zhisheng, director of the puppet Wujiang Wuxi Taxation Management Office, and director of the puppet Nantong Anti-Smoking Bureau, all illegally collected taxes from the enemy and puppets, and exploited the people. After the victory, someone reported to the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau, and the Suzhou Branch of the Bureau forwarded it to the Suzhou High Procuratorate Office for investigation. However, the defendants had already fled and could not be arrested. Now, after the Suzhou High Procuratorate Office concluded the investigation, not only did the original informants accuse the two traitors of their crimes in detail, but they also ordered the police to arrest them many times, but they did not appear in court, showing that they were obviously afraid of guilt and fleeing. Based on the puppet positions they held, it can be imagined that their actions were beneficial to the enemy and puppets and detrimental to our country and the people. Therefore, on the 21st, they were prosecuted and wanted in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Sensational Case in Lixia: The Flying Thief Li Shengwu Case Concludes with Indictment</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Report] The sensational case of the flying thief Li Shengwu (also known as Yanzi Li San) in Lixia has concluded after repeated investigations by the Jinan District Court. It has been learned that the main suspect in the case, Li Shengwu, and the harborer, Li Qinlu, have been indicted by Wu Tingxian, the prosecutor of the Jinan District Court. The indictment lists the facts, evidence, and legal provisions of the crimes committed by Li and others, as follows:</p>
<p>Facts of the Crime: Li Shengwu (also known as Li Shengyuan), also known as Li Tuzi, is from Yucheng County and formerly resided in Shenjia Alley, Qinglong Street, Dongguan. He made theft his regular occupation. In May of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), he stole 47 pieces of goldware from Qingbao Silver Shop on Ximen Street, weighing 24 taels and 6 mace, 169 taels of silver bars, and other items. He was subsequently arrested while selling them and sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the puppet court. Before completing his sentence, he was released on amnesty in May of the 34th year of the Republic (1945) (records available). However, his thieving nature was difficult to change. In June, he stole 20 bolts of spun silk from the Huacheng Cloth Shop on Wei 4th Road and 38 yards of clothing material from Hongshun Tailor Shop. On August 2nd, he stole two gold rings and a dozen watches from the Meizuishi Watch Shop. He committed numerous crimes and spent lavishly. He then stole a handgun from somewhere on Sima Road and hid it inside the German consulate, becoming like a tiger with wings. When the police officers discovered this, detectives Xue Liwen and Zhang Chunting worked together to arrest him. However, he managed to escape while in shackles during the journey. He then resisted arrest with a gun inside the Daguan Garden. Only then did he realize that he was being watched by the military police, so he fled with his family. In May of this month, he secretly came to Jinan. Because of his addiction to opium, he had become acquainted with Li Qinlu, who secretly ran an opium den, and hid there, waiting for an opportunity to act. He deeply resented Xue Liwen and others for arresting him and had long harbored murderous intentions. He then bought a handgun from a Zhang-surnamed opium smoker at Li Qinlu's place and went to seek revenge. On the night of May 8th of this year, while Xue Liwen was out on duty, he killed his mother, He, and his wife, Sun, leaving two spent bullet casings as a deliberate mark. This was reported to the court for verification (records available), and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Li Qinlu learned of this and repeatedly extorted money from him, which angered Li Shengwu. He lured Li Qinlu into the street and shot him four times, hoping to eliminate the evidence (medical report attached). However, seeing that his goal was not achieved, he fled again. Eventually, Li Shengwu returned to this city. On the 5th of this month, he encountered Zhang Chunting and others on Guanyi Street. In a panic, he fled, injuring his left foot, and was finally arrested. Li Qinlu and others were summoned to the bureau and sent to the court together.</p>
<p>Criminal Laws: The defendant in this case, Li Shengwu, confessed without dispute that he had been stealing for many years and had purchased a handgun to commit murder and escape. There are verification reports, medical reports, and arrest warrants as evidence. The facts of the crime are sufficient to be confirmed. As for Li Qinlu, he not only provided a place for people to smoke opium but also deliberately harbored a criminal. He has been clearly identified by Li Shengwu in court. Although he was shot by Li Shengwu and did not die, he should still be judged according to the law. Regarding their actions, Li Shengwu's murder constitutes a crime under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. His attempted murder, possession of military firearms, theft, and escape constitute crimes under Paragraph 2 of the same article and Articles 186, 322, and 161, Paragraph 2 of the same law. Except that the possession of military firearms is jointly related to others and should be punished for the most serious crime according to Article 55 of the same law, the remaining crimes should be prosecuted jointly according to Article 5 of the same law. Li Qinlu's actions constitute a crime under Article 164, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and according to Article 38, Paragraph 1, Items 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, the two spent bullet casings should be confiscated. Except for the defendant's opium-related matters, which will be handled in a separate case, this indictment is filed according to Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Rail Fracture Near Waikuatang</h3>
<p>Fortunately, No Accident Occurred and Was Immediately Repaired</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Report on the 24th] A rail fracture was discovered near Waikuatang on the Jinghu Line between the 87th and 88th foreign bridges after the seventh express train heading downwards passed today. The cause is unknown. Fortunately, no accident occurred. The Suzhou Station took emergency measures, notifying the 74th passenger train heading upwards to slow down, and immediately dispatched workers to repair it. The repairs have now been completed. Trains have been delayed by two hours starting with the 74th passenger train.</p>
<h3>Enemy Property in Qingpu Stolen and Sold Out</h3>
<p>Military Authorities Dispatch Personnel to the County for Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>[Our Qingpu Report] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the enemy troops stationed in this county left behind a large amount of supplies, including steel, rice, wheat, salt, etc. The quantity was considerable, and the value must have been tens of millions of yuan or more. When the enemy troops surrendered their weapons and withdrew, they submitted a list of items transferred to our military and political authorities. These large quantities of enemy property were scattered in Sheshan, the urban area, Zhujiajiao, and other places in this county, lasting for over a year now. It is expected that in this year or so, the persons in charge at the time colluded with unscrupulous elements in local agencies to continuously steal and sell out the enemy property. Recently, the military authorities discovered this and were greatly angered, so on the 19th of this month, they dispatched Colonel Inspector Yin Xiangfan to the county to thoroughly investigate the truth. Sun Rongsheng, a local who runs a shipping business, once sold 68 dan of salt for them at a low price of 13,000 yuan per dan to Xiangfa Mill in this city. Sun Rongsheng has been arrested by Inspector Yin and detained in the county police station. The other stolen and sold goods are being investigated separately.</p>
<h3>Suppression of Bandits in Jiangyin Second Phase of Suppression in Wujiang</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Report on the 24th] Commander Kong Jianqing Gui and County Magistrate Fang, etc., led a team to the Zhutang area in the eastern countryside on the morning of the 24th to supervise the suppression of scattered bandits and to check household registrations to maintain治安.</p>
<p>[Our Wujiang Report] This county borders Lake Tai, and its ports are numerous, making it a place where bandits frequently appear. Suppressing them here and there is a hidden danger to the locality. Previously, the county government mobilized local forces to suppress them, and they have slightly reduced their activities. County Magistrate Gu Hongxi, during this winter defense period, is still worried that the scattered bandits will stir up trouble and endanger rural security. In addition to appointing Chen Dezhao, who is familiar with the geography of the lakefront, as the District Head of Pingwang, to plan military affairs, he concentrated the county's military police and teams, devoting all their efforts to carry out the second phase of suppression. Liang Xi, the head of the Self-Defense Corps, was appointed as the commander-in-chief, stationed in Hengjing. The Provincial Water Police and Security Team were stationed in Wudang, Damiao Port, and other places. On one hand, they are conducting a district-by-district investigation and registration of civilian boats to prevent bandits from mingling in. The Suzhou Suppression Headquarters also sent Staff Officer Chen and others to the county for guidance.</p>
<h3>Two Major Conferences in Songjiang: Review of County Administration in the Third District of Jiangsu Province, Review of Finances in the Third and Fourth Districts</h3>
<p>[Our Songjiang Report] The Third District Administrative Inspectorate convened a conference on the 22nd, gathering the county magistrates of the counties under its jurisdiction: Songjiang, Jinshan, Qingpu, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Shanghai, Jiading, and Chongming. Ge Jianshi, a member of the Provincial Government, attended to provide guidance. Commissioner Xie presided over the meeting. In the morning, the county magistrates of the nine attending counties reported on the current status of their work. In the afternoon, Commander Li of the Corps Area attended the meeting to report. Regarding the counties that have not met their conscription quota, they must complete the conscription and send the recruits by the 25th. Then, county administration issues were discussed, such as formulating self-defense capabilities, strengthening defenses, eliminating bandits, ensuring security, and improving the treatment of administrative personnel, increasing primary school funding, and administrative, conscription, food requisition, and financial matters were all discussed in detail. It was also suggested that after the County Autonomous Tax Bureau was reorganized into the Autonomous Tax Collection Bureau, it became directly under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Government. A joint request will be submitted to the province to return the Tax Bureau to its original system, under the jurisdiction of the county administration. In addition, the financial review conference was held on the 23rd in the Zhongshan Memorial Hall in the County Government, gathering Commissioner Xie Chengbing of the Third District, Commissioner Xu Mojia of the Fourth District, and the county magistrates, finance section chiefs, and tax collection bureau directors of the counties under their jurisdiction to review the finances. Director Dong Zhe of the Provincial Finance Department specially presided over the meeting. The scope of the review was to actively consolidate provincial and county finances to achieve self-sufficiency.</p>
<h3>Symposium on Military Service Held in Wuxing: Request for Prompt Issuance of Resettlement Allowances, Suzhou Strictly Limits the Completion of Conscription by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxing Report] Commander Xia Jiping of the Zhejiang North Garrison District came to Huzhou from Hangzhou on the 19th to supervise military administration. The next morning at 9:00 AM, he convened a symposium in the Second District Commissioner's Office, gathering the heads of Party, government, military, judicial, and legal organs. Commander Xia delivered a speech, stating the various meanings of establishing national defense forces, and reviewed the malpractices of conscription and the future improvement of conscription management methods. Then, Section Chief Wang of the Military Affairs Section of the County Government reported on the progress of the conscription work ordered, and incidentally requested Commander Xia to promptly issue resettlement allowances for the new recruits, which was promised to be forwarded. Also, the County Government, considering that the recruitment period for new recruits is approaching, organized a conscription committee in accordance with the provisions of the Military Service Law to facilitate military administration. They specially invited responsible persons from relevant legal groups and local gentry to meet at 2:00 PM on the 24th to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>[Our Haining Report] The Jiaxing Garrison District Command, in order to study practical military service issues and listen to reports from various counties on the conscription of new recruits, specifically scheduled a meeting of military section chiefs from each county in the Tenth District. The military section chief of this county went to He on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Report] This county has been ordered to handle the temporary conscription of 980 people. Because of the urgent time and the fact that many handlers are not familiar with the detailed procedures, it has been repeatedly extended. According to statistics, as of the 22nd, there are still more than 200 new recruits missing. The County Government of this county has issued another order to each district, setting the end of this month as the final deadline, strictly ordering each district to complete the conscription within the deadline. If there is any further delay, they will be punished in accordance with the regulations for punishing those who obstruct military service, who neglect military service laws, and who fail to conscript and send new recruits within the prescribed time limit, with imprisonment of up to six years.</p>
<h3>A Fierce Bandit Executed by Firing Squad in Zhangzhu</h3>
<p>[Our Zhangzhu Report] The bandit criminals Ren Xibao and Wu Guilan, during the Japanese invasion of Zhangzhu in the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), when our army moved west, murdered Wang Hansheng, the chief of the intelligence section of the 9th company of the 3rd battalion of the 5th regiment, in Dongpan Village, Yuanshan Township, and remained at large. Li Guanghan, the company commander of the 8th company who was with Wang at the time, was fortunate to escape. Recently, the Anti-Banditry Command in the border area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui received a secret report and dispatched officers to the scene of the incident on the night of the 10th of this month. Ren Xibao and Wu Guilan confessed that they and Ren Liansheng and Hu Sanda, following Ren Xibao's instructions, lured Wang Hansheng to the mulberry garden next to the ancestral hall in the village, stabbed him to death with a sharp knife, and carried the body to Gangshan southwest of the village for burial. Hu Sanda is currently at large, Ren Liansheng has died, and Wu Guilan is in custody. The main culprit, Ren Xibao, was found to have previously served as a Jia head in the bandit army, brutally murdered soldiers fighting against Japan, and privately possessed firearms and weapons, confirming all kinds of illegal acts. He was executed by firing squad on the spot on the 20th, to the delight of those who heard about it. The other traffickers are being investigated, arrested, and severely punished.</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Report] The Zhejiang Provincial Government, considering that the cities and counties of this province have previously been ravaged by the enemy, with devastation everywhere, and this autumn has suffered unprecedented wind, insect, and flood disasters, with the affected areas reaching more than 30 counties, almost half of the province, and tens of thousands of disaster victims are in danger of freezing and starvation, making relief efforts urgent, has now approved the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs to actively proceed with the work, and has stipulated that the province raise at least 300 million yuan to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang's 1 Billion Fishing Loan Allocated to Three Prefectures Proportionately</h3>
<p>[Our Ningbo Report] The Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic Products Construction Association held a Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou fisheries construction conference at the Ningbo Sixth District Commissioner's Office on the 20th to discuss the allocation of the 1 billion fishing loan. It was decided to allocate it according to the number of fishermen employed in each place and the number of fishing boats, in percentages. Ningbo Prefecture accounts for 55%, Taizhou Prefecture accounts for 25%, and Wenzhou Prefecture accounts for 20%.

It was later decided to increase Ninghai by 30 million yuan and Zhenhai by 20 million yuan. Taizhou Prefecture: Linhai receives 35%, Wenling 40%, Sanmen 20%, Huangyan 5%. Wenzhou Prefecture: Because no representatives attended, the district will decide on its own.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Cloth Factories Closing Down One After Another</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Report] Since the beginning of summer in this county, stores on the streets have been calling for price reductions, but because the losses are too great, the number of closures is increasing day by day. The commercial future is deeply worrying. There were originally more than 80 large and small weaving factories in the county. Now, due to the authorities' control of raw materials and poor sales, more than 20 factories, including Wanxiang, have closed down in the past month alone. The silk factories are even worse. If no measures are taken to provide relief, the future is unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Local News Briefs</h3>
<p>Ningbo Report: After the Mei Lake in Dongqian Lake in this county was stopped for reclamation, the reclaimers were transferred to Wanniantang in Zhanqi Town by a resolution of the Second County Council to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Result of the Petition by the Grain Industry in Zhejiang Province: Grain Business Tax Exempted</h3>
<p>[Our Haining Report] Jieshi Town in this county is an important distribution center for rice and grain in Zhejiang Province. Previously, it jointly initiated a petition with the grain industry in Hangzhou to request exemption from grain business tax. Representatives were elected from the grain industry throughout the province and sent to the relevant provincial and central government agencies. In addition, representatives from the Provincial Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to Chairman Chiang, who approved it for handling by the relevant authorities. According to a quick telegram from the representative of this county, the Ministry of Finance, considering that grain is related to people's food and has a great impact on prices, in order to reduce the burden of people's food and stabilize grain and prices, has approved the continued exemption from business tax for one year and will issue another order to that effect.

<h3>Hospital's Response to the Death of Yan Jinwen's Daughter</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Yan Jinwen: Your letter expresses your grief and indignation over the death of your sick child, which is truly sympathetic. However, this matter is of great importance to the reputation of the hospital. We have forwarded your letter to the First Red Cross Hospital to inquire whether there was any negligence. The hospital's reply states: "On the morning of the 14th of this month at around 1:00 AM, a person named Yan Jinwen brought a female infant, just over one month old and barely breathing, to the hospital for treatment. The pediatrician on duty immediately examined her. According to the child's parents, 'The child's mother was eight and a half months pregnant when the child was born, making her a premature baby; she has been sick for more than half a month, with abdominal distension and frequent vomiting and crying. Because of superstitious beliefs, she was not sent to the hospital. Now that her condition is critical, she has been brought here for rescue.' After examination by Dr. Liu, it was found that the girl was thin and small, obviously congenitally deficient. Her navel was inflamed, leading to peritonitis, which caused the abdomen to swell like a drum. Moreover, the navel had never closed after the umbilical cord fell off, and liquid was flowing out during the examination. The veins of the umbilical cord were abnormally prominent, indicating a long period of illness. At that time, because the child's condition was serious and she was barely breathing, the nurse was first instructed to give a subcutaneous injection of caffeine sodium benzoate. After the injection, she died. (Note: Caffeine sodium benzoate is a mild and stable cardiac stimulant with neutralizing properties and no fatal toxicity. This can be verified in the pharmacopoeia and by public evaluation by pharmaceutical and medical experts.) The parent, Yan Jinwen, suspected that the injection caused the death and seized the needle bottle, not asking why, and left with the body. Seeing his abnormal behavior, the doctor was afraid that he would take the needle bottle away, leaving no evidence, and asked him to issue a receipt, stating the words 'empty bottle of caffeine sodium benzoate', or to personally wrap, seal, and sign it for evidence, but he refused. Mr. Yu, the duty officer of the hospital's administrative office, seeing that there was no way to reason with him, reported it to the Jing'an Temple District Police Station (the police station was reported by the hospital on its own initiative, and the Jing'an Temple District Police Station has a record of it), requesting them to send someone to the hospital to investigate the truth. Subsequently, on the 15th, the court prosecutor and bailiff legally performed an autopsy, determining that the death was due to illness and ordering the child's family to take the body back for burial. This is the actual situation at the time." According to this, it seems that the child was extremely weak, and medicine was ineffective. For your comfort, you can only try to suppress your grief. Special reply."</p>
<h3>Xiangde Road Will Restore Light</h3>
<p>Reader Ouyang Wenjun wrote to this newspaper stating that Xiangde Road needs light. We have received a reply from the Public Utilities Bureau stating: "Mr. Ouyang's concern for public welfare is greatly appreciated. The original streetlights in that area were installed during the enemy puppet era and were of an unsuitable style and dilapidated. Therefore, the Shanghai North Streetlight Management Office of this bureau was ordered to dismantle them and plan to replace them with new light poles. The light poles that have been ordered have now been delivered. The streetlights in that area will be able to restore light before the end of this month." Please wait patiently for the lights to be turned on.</p>
<h3>Echoing the Mechanical Calendar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I read the news in your newspaper about "Yongjia youth Chen Wei inventing a mechanical calendar." I, in my incompetence, also created a solar calendar week conversion calendar in April of this year. If the calendar method does not change, this conversion calendar can also be used for ten thousand years and is extremely convenient, using a disk with a diameter of six centimeters (about two and a half inches) to rotate and convert. I don't know if Mr. Chen Wei's calendar is purely a solar calendar conversion calendar or a lunisolar calendar conversion calendar. I would be grateful if Mr. Chen Wei could answer.

<h3>Comparison of the Draft Constitution Amendment Before and After Review</h3>
<p>News Agency Data Room</p>
<p>The amendment to the draft Constitution of the Republic of China has been passed by the full session of the Legislative Yuan and is expected to be approved by the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The result of the review of the Constitution by the Central Standing Committee and the joint meeting of the five committees of the Legislative Yuan is largely the same as the original amendment, but there are slight changes in several places. For example, the amendment has been increased from 148 articles to 151 articles. For example, Articles 45, 57, 92, 99, and 104 are not found in the original draft amendment, but were newly added during the review. Articles 62 and 91 of the original draft amendment have been deleted, and other textual revisions have been made, with changes to their positions before and after.</p>
<p>Regarding the newly added articles, Article 45 states: "The President, with respect to disputes between the Yuan, may convene a meeting of the heads of the relevant Yuan for consultation to resolve the disputes, except as otherwise provided in this Constitution." The organizations of the government are all interconnected, especially the close relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, as stipulated in Article 58. However, the Constitution is the fundamental law of a country, serving only as an outline, and the changes in the political situation of the country cannot be fully covered by the Constitution. The addition of this new article is actually to supplement the shortcomings of Article 58.</p>
<p>The newly added Article 57 is a provision for the appointment of heads of ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan. The original amendment only had provisions for the appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan, but made no mention of the heads of the various ministries and commissions. The executive branch is the institution for implementing various undertakings, and in addition to the President, the heads of the various ministries and commissions are the persons who actually implement government orders, and they must also be stipulated within the Constitution. At the same time, the heads of the various ministries and commissions are the right-hand men of the President of the Executive Yuan, and their nomination by the President of the Executive Yuan can further enhance their assistance.</p>
<p>Article 92 adds the following: "When the Examination Yuan submits a bill on matters under its jurisdiction, the Secretary-General of the Examination Yuan shall attend the Legislative Yuan to explain it." Legislation is the work of the Legislative Yuan, but regarding laws and regulations on examinations, appointments, and personnel administration, the Legislative Yuan sometimes does not know the purpose behind them. If the Examination Yuan can provide explanations, the resulting new laws and regulations can be more practical.</p>
<p>Article 99 states: "When the Control Yuan exercises the power of consent in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution, it shall be done by a resolution of more than half of the members of the entire Yuan." The organization of the Control Yuan is a committee system, and the number of people required to pass a resolution must be explicitly stipulated. In addition to the provisions of Articles 103 and 105, this article supplements them to make them more complete.</p>
<p>In the original draft amendment, the powers of the Control Yuan were limited to the impeachment of central and local administrative personnel. However, judicial and examination personnel may also have illegal or derelict conduct, but they can be treated in the same manner as administrative personnel. However, the express stipulation now makes it clearer and more accurate.</p>
<p>As for the two articles that were deleted, the content of Article 62 of the original draft amendment is the same as the nature of Article 58, paragraph 1 after review, so it can be deleted to avoid duplication. The original Article 91, which was deleted, was about the term of office of the members of the Examination Yuan. The members of the Examination Yuan are nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan, which is different from the legislators and controllers directly elected by the people. Since they are not produced by election, there is no need to stipulate a term of office.</p>
<p>The above are all additions and deletions of the entire text. In addition, there are also modifications to some parts. Among the important ones is Article 143, regarding the purpose of education, in addition to the original three items, two items, "national morality" and "sound physique," have been added. Morality has always been the foundation of our country's establishment in the past. In the past, Confucian education focused on cultivating morality, and future education must also pay attention to this. In view of the situation in our country, a sound physique should also be included as necessary, so as to wash away the shame of the "sick man of East Asia" and be able to bear the important responsibility of national construction in the future.</p>
<p>Article 147, regarding the interpretation of laws by the Judicial Yuan when they conflict with the Constitution, the original provision "submitted by the Executive Yuan within six months after the law takes effect" has been deleted. Doubts about conflicts between laws and the Constitution can arise at any time, not necessarily within half a year. If it is rigidly stipulated, what will happen if doubts about conflicts arise after half a year? Now that the stipulated time limit has been deleted, the Judicial Yuan can be requested to interpret doubts at any time in the future.</p>
<p>A paragraph of text has been deleted from both Articles 5 and 11. The main text of Article 5 is: "All ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal." This already includes everything. The paragraph behind it was originally just an annotation to the previous paragraph, but it seems to have an unclear contradiction, so it is appropriate to delete it. The text deleted from Article 11 is: "Government agencies or troops shall not forcibly occupy civilian houses." Forcibly occupying civilian houses is obstructing the freedom of residence of the people. Since the people have the freedom of residence and movement, there is no need to explain it again.</p>
<p>Article 105, regarding the impeachment of the President by the Control Yuan, the number of members of the Control Yuan who propose it has been increased from ten to one-fourth. The impeachment of the President is a very important matter. If the proposal of ten members of the Control Yuan is felt to be weak, it is now changed to one-fourth. Although the number of members of the Control Yuan is increased on the surface, it actually emphasizes the powers of the members of the Control Yuan.</p>
<p>The above items are all important modifications. Other changes include changing "ethnic autonomous regions" to "Mongolian leagues and Tibet." The original Articles 67 and 68 were moved back and changed to Articles 78 and 79. These are not of great significance and will not be discussed separately. (End)</p>

<h3>The Five-Power Conference Creates a Divided Situation, the Soviet Union Firmly Rejects Limiting the Veto Power, the Whole Case Will Be Returned to the United Nations General Assembly for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our reporter in New York, 24th] At a meeting of the five powers held yesterday at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov rejected the Western allies' proposal to limit the veto power in the Security Council. Mr. Molotov's firm attitude will inevitably lead to the failure of future attempts by small countries to demand amendments to the United Nations voting procedures, and at the same time the movement to restrict the use of the veto power will come to an end. Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin advocated the establishment of an agreement to abolish the use of the veto power for smaller matters. Bevin argued that the Security Council should make every effort to reach an agreement before putting questions that might involve the veto power to a vote. Chinese representative Gu Weijun and French representative Baradot also seconded Bevin's proposal. But Molotov insisted on his original position, demanding that the General Assembly not accept any proposals to limit the veto power. At this time, Bevin stood up and said: It is futile to continue discussing this matter, and the meeting ended.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 23rd] At today's secret meeting of the five powers, the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov frankly rejected the efforts made by the four countries of the United States, Britain, China and France to discuss restricting the use of the veto power, creating a divided situation among the five powers, and the whole case will be returned to the United Nations General Assembly. According to Western diplomats who attended the meeting, Molotov clashed with the other four powers' representatives. At the beginning of the meeting, Mr. Molotov asked other representatives to pass a motion declaring opposition to restricting the veto power stipulated in the United Nations Charter, and opposed adding it to the United Nations organization in a rigid form, and advocated promoting coordination among the United Nations. Molotov suggested submitting this draft sacrifice to the United Nations General Assembly for adoption. It is said that there are many opinions on the voting system of the Security Council, and the General Assembly should immediately take definite action to support it. British Foreign Secretary Bevin. US Secretary of State Byrnes, Chinese representative Gu Weijun and French representative Baradot all believed that Molotov's proposal was unacceptable. However, judging from the wording of Molotov's proposal and his firm demand that the General Assembly take action, there is no doubt that when the General Assembly discusses this issue, the Soviet Union will use the strongest sentence to demand the rejection of all criticisms of the veto power.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] San Francisco, 24th broadcast: Today is Sunday, the United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Ministers Conference are both closed, but the representatives of the four countries of China, Britain, the United States and France held informal talks to discuss how to deal with the situation caused by the Soviet Union's refusal to accept the veto power amendment.

<h3>Our Country Suffered the Most Damage During the War, Japan's Compensation Should Be Higher, Our Representative to the Far East Commission Clarifies His Position</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 23rd] The countries in the Pacific that suffered war losses are eager to use Japan's industrial compensation as a source of materials for reconstruction. The United States is continuing its efforts to have the Japanese compensation issue discussed in early December to find a solution and implement it. Countries demanding compensation are now making preliminary estimates of compensation, but difficult problems are emerging one after another. There are two new difficult problems: (1) Should the Japanese assets within the borders of the countries applying for compensation be included in the total compensation value for all countries? (2) How should the Japanese existing property that Sernian moved away from the territory of the Nine Provinces of Northeast China be calculated? It is now known that China and the Philippines believe that this property should not be included in the total compensation project, but should belong to the country where the property is located, and the property in Japan should be allocated to meet the compensation requirements of these countries. This attitude is different from that of the United States, which insists that all Japanese assets, no matter in which country, should be included in the total compensation project. The Chinese representative explained China's position in the Far East Committee, saying: "China is concerned about everything in Japan that can compensate for our war losses, because we suffered the most damage among the countries participating in the Pacific War; we require various assets from Japan. There are more than other countries. We are eager to obtain anything of value to us. China has no intention of intimidating or retaliating against Japan, but only seeks fairness for itself." The Middle and Philippine countries are preparing to open a list of war items to Japan, including Japanese industrial assets, such as shipyards, dry docks, cement plants, paper mills, mining equipment, expansion copper plants, power plants, coconut oil plants, fishing boats, lumber mill equipment, woodworking machinery, textile factories, etc. It is reported that the Philippines hopes to obtain at least 1 billion US dollars worth of Japanese assets; however, the United States will advocate that Japan retain appropriate industries and assets to maintain its economic life. At the same time, it advocates that Japanese assets in North Korea should be kept intact.</p>
<h3>Dissolution of Japanese Zaibatsu, Huge Amounts of Shares Sold</h3>

<h3>Japanese Women Sold into Prostitution, Worth Less Than Leather Shoes</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Tokyo, 23rd] The Tokyo Shimbun reported that Japanese farmers are forced to sell their daughters as prostitutes due to livelihood, and the price is surprisingly low, only worth 500 yen per person, which is even lower than a pair of leather shoes. Although it is strictly prohibited by law to sell women from good families as prostitutes, general brothel owners still openly violate it; therefore, the dens of iniquity in major cities are crowded with customers.</p>

<h3>Truman Returns to Capital for Meeting;</h3>
<p>High-Level Discussions on Addressing Coal Mine Strike;</p>
<p>Government Advocates Nationwide Coal Rationing</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] President Truman returned to the capital from Key West City this afternoon and immediately met with Labor Secretary Schwellenbach to discuss the ongoing coal mine strike. Several senior government officials also participated.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] President Truman, who had been on vacation in Florida for a week, returned here today and told reporters that a meeting would be held to discuss the coal mine strike. At the same time, the government advocates strict implementation of coal rationing throughout the country. Various indications suggest that this strike may be protracted, leading to a tough battle with Lewis and the United Mine Workers of America he leads. Interior Secretary Krug has telegraphed the governors of all forty-eight states, suggesting restrictions on industrial power use and the implementation of electricity conservation measures that are more extensive than previous orders. In areas with low coal reserves, entertainment venues will be closed altogether, and even schools may be closed. The court is scheduled to hear Lewis's appeal against the injunction on Monday. Lewis's legal representatives and the Department of Justice are actively preparing for the debate. Truman returned to the capital to personally direct the implementation of the order to fight Lewis to the end and will hold a series of formal meetings to find ways to prevent the total shutdown of four hundred thousand bituminous coal miners. Despite being summoned for contempt of court, Lewis has not indicated that he will order a return to work.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] Senior U.S. government officials predict that the U.S. coal mine strike will affect the political situation in Western Europe. Although they do not believe that the United States is using fuel and food as political weapons, they also acknowledge that these two items are important political issues in Europe today. If the United States cannot fulfill its anti-famine plan, its foreign relations will inevitably suffer.</p>
<h3>Surplus of Male Stars in Hollywood;</h3>
<p>Plain-Looking Young Women Seize the Opportunity to Rise</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hollywood, 23rd] The movie capital is constantly changing. During the war, male stars were as rare as phoenix feathers because young men had joined the army, and the remaining men were either too old or too young, resulting in female stars dominating films. Now that the war is over, the situation has completely reversed, with male stars as numerous as the grains of sand in the river. Because the young boys during the war have matured, and the soldiers who enlisted have also returned home, resulting in a surplus of talent. As a result, top leading men such as Clark Gable, Robert Taylor, Tyrone Power, etc., are all starting to become overshadowed; while the wartime female actors are aging, creating a gap between generations. Young girls like Ge Aite, Lin Fusi, and Bei Dai, who have no outstanding works, have surprisingly risen to prominence. Companies are recruiting up-and-coming female stars, and with demand exceeding supply, girls have an opportunity to advance.</p>

<h3>The Indian Political Situation Is Becoming Increasingly Serious</h3>
<p>Nehru Demands Punishment of British-Indian Officials</p>
<p>[Reuters, Meerut, United Provinces, India, 23rd] Indian Interim Government Vice President Nehru, in a speech at the Congress Party conference today, demanded the punishment of British-Indian officials involved in the 1942 incident (when Congress Party leaders launched the "Quit India" movement and Nehru and others were imprisoned). He revealed that the Viceroy of India, Wavell, had suggested to him not to suppress officials, to which he replied that he had no intention of oppressing officials but would not compromise with officials who were at fault in the 1942 case, regardless of whether they were British or Indian. Nehru further stated that although the British in India were loudly proclaiming their withdrawal from India, they were actually conspiring to sabotage India's plans. However, India's enemies are not limited to the British; there are also internal enemies. In the struggle for India's liberation, these enemies must be eliminated, and corrupt elements must be eradicated. Another Congress Party leader, Patel, called for an end to the riots to avoid harming the nation's vitality and India's reputation. He said that success can only be achieved by using peaceful and benevolent methods, and violence will inevitably encounter violence. The partition plan of India cannot be implemented by force; otherwise, India will never have peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Meerut, India, 23rd Special Dispatch] Since Nehru revealed the conflict between the Indian Interim Government and Jinnah's statement, the Indian political situation has become increasingly tense. Jinnah's statement was issued last Thursday when Muslim League members refused to participate in the Constituent Assembly, and the seriousness of the political situation seems to have reached a peak. Jinnah declared, "Under no circumstances do we want to withdraw from the Indian government." If the Congress Party's resolution demanding the British withdrawal from India is implemented, Indians must learn to defend themselves.</p>

Therefore, the Finance Bureau has telegraphed the Supreme National Defense Council, requesting a delay in passage to maintain municipal administration.</p>

<h3>The Dayu Steamer Completes Repairs in March;</h3>
<p>Sea Trial;</p>
<p>Maiden Voyage to Hankou Tomorrow Night</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Dada Steamboat Company was founded in the 31st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. For decades, it has been struggling to operate. Before the war, it already had a considerable fleet, including five Yangtze River vessels of more than 1,000 tons, and more than a dozen barges and small boats of several hundred tons. However, when the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, some were requisitioned by the government and sunk, while others were looted and occupied by the enemy. Those that went upstream devoted themselves to serving the transportation work in the rear; however, they were successively destroyed by enemy aircraft. Only remnants remained, moored between desolate beaches and shallow waters. The impact was indescribable. After the victory, the company, in view of the importance of aviation, discussed with the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to resume navigation to Nantong and other ports with the small ships it received. It also joined with Datong Shipping Company to form a joint venture to handle business. In May of last year, it was approved by the Ministry of Communications to obtain a loan of 76 million yuan to repair the damaged Dada steamboats and sail the Shanghai-Hankou line. It then salvaged the Dayu and Daqing steamboats, which had capsized in Badong and Qingtan, and brought them into the shipyard for repair. Now, after three months of work and a cost of 1 billion yuan, the repairs to the Dayu steamer have been completed. The company specially invited people from all walks of life to visit and test sail it yesterday afternoon, traveling to the river surface near Gaoqiao and returning. It arrived in Shanghai at 4:45 PM. The ship has joined the Shanghai-Hankou line and is scheduled to depart for Hankou on the night of the 26th. The Dayu steamer was originally the Daji steamer, which was rebuilt in 1931. The ship is 216 feet long and 36 feet wide, with a cabin depth of 12.3 feet. The total tonnage is 1,445.331 tons, and the registered tonnage is 864.45. The speed is 11 knots per hour. The economy class can accommodate 905 passengers. The first, second, and third class cabins can accommodate 170 people.</p>
<h3>Zizhong Steamer Joins the Northern Route</h3>
<p>Yesterday Hosted Family Members of the Late General Zhang</p>
<p>In order to commemorate the martyrs of the War of Resistance, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company named the new 3,500-ton ocean-going vessel purchased from Canada the "Zizhong" after General Zhang Zizhong, who died in the War of Resistance, and will use it to run the northern route. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specially invited General Zhang's family members and relatives and friends in Shanghai to visit the ship at 9:00 AM this morning. It is reported that General Zhang's younger brother, Ziming, will present the ship's captain with a portrait of General Zhang in military uniform and will also present a poem by General Feng Wangxiang and a majestic and solemn choral piece "General Zhang Zizhong," composed by Wu Bochao, as the ship's song.</p>
<p>Suggestion to Restore Yu Qiaqing Road</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, a memorial service was held at the Siming Cemetery. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Zhengting, Yan Huiqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and more than 20 others served as the presidium. After paying respects and condolences, Wang Xiaolai first reported on the life of Mr. Yu, followed by speeches from Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan, who praised Mr. Yu's spirit of diligence, frugality, and service to society. Mr. Wang Xiaolai suggested on the spot that Xizang Road be restored to Yu Qiaqing Road. Mayor Wu immediately replied that it would be sent to the Municipal Senate for a decision after it was passed by the Municipal Administration Meeting. Wei Bozhen, the managing director of the Ningbo Natives Association, reported that Mr. Yu had also wished to establish Siming University, Siming Middle School, Qiaqing Hospital, and a fisheries school, but these undertakings had not been completed. He hoped that everyone would work hard to carry on his legacy. The students of the Siming Volunteer Primary School then sang a dirge, and the family thanked the attendees. Finally, the posthumous title "Diligent and Accomplished" was announced, and the ceremony ended.</p>

<h3>Interest Income Tax Issue;</h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Direct Tax Bureau;</p>
<p>Requesting Application of Self-Assessment Method</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the Shanghai Printing Industry Association's report that its member, Huafeng Printing and Typecasting Factory, had previously borrowed money from financial institutions other than Rongwai, and that it was unable to withhold the interest income tax, sent a letter to the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance requesting the application of the self-assessment method. The following is an excerpt from the letter: "To the esteemed Director, according to a letter from the Shanghai Printing Industry Association, a letter from Huafeng Printing and Typecasting Factory states: 'Our factory has been engaged in the cultural industry for more than 30 years. It suffered heavy losses during the War of Resistance. After the victory, in order to revive part of the business, we had to resort to high-interest loans. Since February and March of this year, the burden has become heavier and heavier, and business has declined. We cannot bear the exploitation of high-interest loans. Therefore, the part of the business that had been restarted was dissolved. Yesterday, officials from the Direct Tax Bureau came to our factory and instructed us to declare the income tax on deposit interest. They said that the collection of this tax began on January 1st of this year. Regardless of whether it is a deposit or a loan, all interest-related transactions must be withheld.' After hearing this, we were greatly alarmed, because we had no knowledge of this law beforehand, so we did not withhold any taxes. However, even if we knew about this and wanted to deduct it, it would be difficult to borrow money, unless the borrower paid it on our behalf. If that is the case, in addition to bearing high interest, we would have to pay another loan tax, which would be unbearable for the borrower (excerpt omitted).' After investigation, it was found that if industrial and commercial enterprises borrow money from institutions other than banks, such as paying interest to the lenders instead of withholding deposit interest income tax, borrowers will have difficulties. Lenders may take advantage of this situation to extort and coerce, so that named on our behalf, the actual need of pay borrowers, the original said the so-called "excluding negative high profits, but also another to pay a loan tax," according to the current situation, is the truth, it is inevitable that business will be more difficult. Article 23 of the Income Tax Law stipulates: 'The income of the third category shall be reported by the withholders or self-payers of income tax to the competent collection agency in accordance with the statutory format within 15 days after each payment or receipt of interest.' It is also the deposit Interest Tax, originally scheduled to have two kinds of means witholding as well as self assessment, according to letter before, the so-called collection difficulty. We fear that is not only the situation of Hua Feng Print Company; therefore, we ask your office for the following clarification, all those with the above situation, the self assessment shall be applied for interest Tax in general, exempted for payment, so as to reduce the difficulty of borrowers, as a little less to burden for the industrial and business."</p>

<h3>From American Goods Stalls to United Shopping Centers - Though Small, It Has All the Organs - Weak Purchasing Power Affects Sluggish Business</h3>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) "American Goods Stalls" and "United Shopping Centers." Different in name, but essentially the same. Because the constituents of the shopping centers are the stall vendors who were shut down. They have merely developed from "fighting alone" to "collective cooperation." "United Shopping Centers" are indeed "children of the times." Their emergence is due to: (1) Unstable times, economic depression in all industries, and many unemployed people, who have no choice but to take the easiest way to make a living. (2) Rampant smuggling in this city, with a large amount of surplus materials sold by the U.S. military, and the general public's extreme trust in "American-style equipment." Thus, in order to promote these American goods, "stalls" and "shopping centers" came into being. Regardless of their organization and form, they can achieve the same goal. (3) Stagnant industry and commerce, coupled with extremely high wages and living expenses. At this moment, small capital simply does not dare to open a shop. Forcibly opening one is a slow form of suicide. Rather than doing so, it is better to rent a "32-inch" glass tabletop in a "United Shopping Center," acting as both boss and clerk, with the ability to attack and defend, which is more stable and secure. This is the historical background for the emergence of "United Shopping Centers." At the same time, this situation is like a mirror, reflecting the distorted development of our economy and the crisis of the entire society.</p>
<p>The Rapid Rise of Numerous Markets</p>
<p>"United Shopping Centers" have developed very rapidly. They emerged after the city government's strict crackdown on stalls in early September. However, in a short time, there are already more than thirty United Shopping Centers in Shanghai today. Yesterday, this reporter passed by Zhongzheng East Road, entered a "United Shopping Center," and chatted with a shop assistant for a few minutes. He frankly said: He used to be a stall vendor, now he is a member of a United Shopping Center. The origin of the shopping center's organization is as follows: After the American goods stalls were shut down, people with business acumen saw the inevitability of shopping centers. So, an "initiator" used a large sum of money to take over a bar and turn it into today's site. All the stall vendors who came to operate paid a transfer fee of 850,000 yuan per person, and a monthly rent of 60,000 yuan, to rent a 32-inch glass tabletop area. However, the tabletop had to be provided by themselves. The lease term is set for three years, but they hope to have priority in renewing the lease in the future, so as not to be evicted when the lease expires. They are now preparing to negotiate with the "General Manager's Office." This shopping center was successfully organized by 109 stall vendor units. The variety of goods is extensive. Clothing includes American-style coats, raincoats, sweaters, wool vests, military blankets, hats, etc. There are even more varieties of food, from packaged foods, biscuits, coffee, cocoa, various candies...everything is available. Daily necessities such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, and cosmetics are also available. "Though small, it has all the organs," it is simply a miniature of a large department store. At the same time, our country has started its century with commerce. President Roosevelt said it well: "Commerce is the lifeblood of a free society." They have a unique understanding of making goods beautiful and pleasing to the eye, which is further enhanced by the milky white lighting. Moreover, the prices are indeed cheaper than in department stores. No wonder ordinary citizens with weak purchasing power flock to become customers. However, things are valued when they are scarce. Now, United Shopping Centers are opening too quickly and too many, which has affected business. A person selling medicines told me: Business is very bad. Sometimes he has to run around and sell unsold medicines to other businesses, earning 20,000 yuan per day to maintain a basic living.</p>
<p>The Only Strong Opponent of Big Companies</p>
<p>I remember that the city government decided to shut down American goods stalls on September 1 mainly for two reasons: First, they provided an outlet for smuggled goods and stolen goods from the docks. At that time, Mayor Wu said: "Items stolen from dock warehouses are sold on Xikou Road stalls within three days." Second, "The range of goods on each stall is very wide, and some have capital of up to tens of millions of yuan. Although the scale is no different from stores, they evade tax obligations, which has a considerable impact on legitimate businesses." After the exchange rate adjustment, the city government required companies not to raise prices, and the companies repeatedly demanded the crackdown on stalls. So the stalls were shut down, and the threat to big companies was eliminated. But in a short time, these stalls have reappeared in the form of "United Shopping Centers," becoming a headache again. Why are large department stores afraid of these small, makeshift shopping centers? The answer is easy to obtain. First, the latter has lower expenses and lighter costs. Their clerks are the bosses themselves, or the boss's family members. With lighter costs, the selling price can be lower. On the other hand, in large companies, the salaries of hundreds of employees must be included in the expenses. Without considerable profits, they cannot be maintained. The second point needs to be analyzed from the perspective of the customer's psychology. In shopping centers, they welcome you to look at the goods and patiently accompany you with a smile until you buy them. If you don't buy them, it doesn't matter to them, because their second-hand American military surplus materials are not appreciated by respectable people, and stall vendors have some inferiority complex. But in large companies, it is embarrassing to look at the goods and not buy them, and the attitude and appearance of company employees are far from the standards required by American business psychology. The main reason is that the value of currency has fallen, and the purchasing power of citizens is weak. American goods shopping centers have cheap goods, which easily attract customers.</p>
<p>Now, the city government has paid great attention to "United Shopping Centers." It believes that these "shopping centers are neither company organizations nor partnerships. Most of them are funded by the landlords to rent houses, add decorations, or even construct them with wooden frames and cloth awnings, resulting in too many stalls and narrow aisles. Once a fire occurs, it is unimaginable. And it is inevitable that tax-evading goods, stolen goods, will be sold here." The Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau have drafted the Shanghai Department Store Management Regulations, the principles of which have been approved at the municipal meeting and will be announced and implemented soon. Shopping centers that have already been established must apply for registration within a time limit. In the future, any new establishments must first be approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. Shopping centers must pay taxes in accordance with the law, otherwise they will be suspended. Unauthorized construction of shopping centers without a building permit will also be included in the crackdown. The sale of goods that violate health regulations and the sale of substandard medicines are prohibited. If private goods are found in any shopping center, it will be immediately suspended. At the same time, the shopping center's account books should be available for inspection at any time. Therefore, American goods shopping centers will be strictly managed in the future. Existing ones may be closed, and the addition of new ones is out of the question. These measures may even be a prelude to a crackdown!</p>
<h3>American Goods Flood the Market - Inexhaustible! Inexhaustible!</h3>
<p>Analyzing the constituent members of American goods shopping centers, there are indeed a few people with financial resources, but most are poor people who cannot find employment. From American goods stalls to American goods shopping centers, it is all to maintain a livelihood. They have no power to smuggle. Smugglers are powerful people. Their goods are purchased in bulk from foreign firms or bought second-hand. There are too many American goods in Shanghai now. Even if there are no more supplements in the future, they will not be sold out for a considerable period of time. A fair person will not be overly sympathetic to these small vendors selling smuggled American goods, but they acknowledge the fact that they are seeking a living. They will wholeheartedly support proper management, and believe that if these people cannot be transferred to useful occupations, management, reasonable and strict management is the only measure that can be adopted. The entire country and society are in a "transition period," and there are many distorted phenomena. American goods shopping centers are only one of them, and a very small one.</p>

<h3>Two Cases of Dock Theft Uncovered</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] On the 14th, a British ship docked at the Yichang Wharf of Little Jardine on Pudong, loaded with steel plates, pigments, and other items. While unloading, dock workers Wang Ganlin and Yin Wanlong, taking advantage of their work, stole pigments and hoisted them onto Tan Dalong's sampan, which they had conspired in advance. They sailed to a secluded place to divide the spoils. The case was detected by the Tilanqiao Police Station, and the principal offender Wang Ganlin and accomplice Tan Dalong were arrested. Part of the stolen goods were also found in Yin Wanlong's home. However, the suspect was out on business at the time and was not caught. It is reported that the case has been sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for strict investigation. The remaining criminals are still being pursued.</p>
<p>Wu Minggao, a temporary worker at the Huishan Wharf, took advantage of the Customs' takeover of enemy property on the morning of the 22nd. When transporting military blankets from the Huishan Wharf to the Customs warehouse, he stole five military blankets and two pieces of canvas and placed them in a hidden place. After finishing work at 5 pm, he hoisted the stolen goods down from the rear wall of the warehouse and took a sampan to the Gongping Road Wharf to go ashore. At that time, his panicked expression was noticed by plainclothes police officers Guan Zhuting and Chen Yaguan from the Tilanqiao Police Station. They went forward to question him, but his answers were evasive. He was taken to the police station for interrogation, and he confessed the whole story.

<h3>Shanghai's Relief Work</h3>
<p>— Special Report from This Newspaper</p>
<p>The waning autumn light has been blown away by the howling northwest wind. Many homeless poor people, wrapped in tattered cotton wadding, shiver in the cold wind, and frozen corpses are about to be found on the streets. This is another angle of the lens in a big city. Who says Shanghai is still a paradise! "Compassion for the poor" is a fine virtue that has been passed down in our country for thousands of years. Winter relief is a timely term at present. The municipal government, under extremely difficult financial circumstances, has also established a Winter Relief Committee to handle the annual social relief work. This is good news for the poor in Shanghai. It is hoped that the work can be started as soon as possible, and the poor can receive relief one day sooner.</p>
<p>Shanghai is indeed a metropolis. Not only is the number of charitable organizations more than elsewhere, but the work done is also more successful. Originally, what is most needed for running charitable undertakings is money. If the wealthy merchants and businessmen in Shanghai slightly save a little on the expenses of cigarettes, alcohol, and entertainment, the amount will be very considerable, and the undertaking will be easy to run.</p>
<p>"It is difficult to open the gate of charity" was originally just a cliché, but now people who run charitable undertakings do have this feeling. With soaring prices, charitable organizations all feel economically strained. Although donations come in steadily, they cannot offset the pressure of high prices. The huge deficit on the books cannot be made up, and some undertakings have to be stopped. But seeing so many singing stages and dance halls, tea houses and restaurants, where money is spent lavishly without any hesitation, it is hoped that the rich people in Shanghai will save a little to save these poor and helpless compatriots.</p>
<h3>The Long-Standing Renji Hall</h3>
<p>On Yunnan Road, near Edward Road, there is a tall, temple-style old building standing in the line of many shops. This is the Renji Shantang, an organization in Shanghai that has been running charitable undertakings for sixty-four years.</p>
<p>Renji Hall is now famous throughout Shanghai. The relief work it has been doing, such as providing medical care, medicine, infant care, widow relief, clothing, and rice, has been continuous and tireless for decades, and has indeed benefited many poor people. This ancient charitable organization, from the "Civilization Bureau" to the "Zhonghe Bureau" to the "Renji Hall," has experienced many difficulties over the past sixty years. However, the people in charge have upheld the spirit of "feeling hungry when others are hungry and feeling drowned when others are drowned," and have worked to provide the poor with matters of life and death. This is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Sixty-four years ago, a "Civilization Bureau" appeared near the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road. It was the predecessor of the Renji Shantang. The social welfare undertakings undertaken by the Civilization Bureau mainly included cherishing and collecting waste paper, opening free schools, and promoting persuasive campaigns to the public. In addition, it also devoted itself to charitable undertakings such as caring for the poor and relieving widows. In general, it was worthy of the name "Civilization Bureau." At that time, charitable undertakings in Shanghai were still in a primitive state, relying on the kind words and deeds of individual philanthropists. There was no organization, let alone undertaking. However, the establishment of the Civilization Bureau gave Shanghai society a considerable stimulus.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Civilization Bureau, its undertakings increased and its scope gradually expanded due to the actual needs of society. Soon it moved from Nanjing Road to Beihai Road and was renamed the Zhonghe Bureau. At this time, the Zhonghe Bureau not only received the gratitude of the general public, but also gained the trust of many philanthropists, and the amount of donations increased day by day. At this time, the charitable undertaking of providing medical care and medicine was started, which provided the greatest assistance to the poor at that time.</p>
<p>After receiving encouragement from all walks of life, the people in charge of the Zhonghe Bureau further enhanced their belief in serving the society and hoped to maintain this sacred work forever. Therefore, they purchased the land on Yunnan Road today as a permanent foundation, and at the same time expanded the scope of the undertaking. The name was changed from Zhonghe Bureau to Renji Hall. This was in the ninth year of the Guangxu reign. At that time, Mr. Shi Shanchang was in charge, and Taishou Jia Yu Gao Shi also made a lot of effort. It is worthy of commemoration that the government and the people joined forces to run charitable undertakings, and it will always be remembered as a good story.</p>
<p>When we stepped into this old building and saw those plaques, we could not help but feel nostalgic for the past. The horizontal plaque with the words "Renji Hall" inscribed by Yu Quyuan is still hanging there for people to admire.</p>
<p>Providing medical care and medicine is the main work of the Renji Hall. Every morning, it is crowded with people waiting for diagnosis and medicine. The north and south halls are the diagnosis rooms for each department, and next to them is the place to dispense medicine. Every doctor carefully asks about the symptoms, diagnoses the source of the disease, and prescribes prescriptions carefully. They patiently guide the patients like a慈母Teaching their children, without the airs of famous doctors, nor the stern faces seen in big hospitals. They are very worthy of the words "仁心仁术(Benevolent Heart and Skilled Hands)."</p>
<p>The medicine dispensary is like an ordinary Chinese medicine store. The clerks work carefully with agile movements. Thousands of doses of medicine are dispensed from here every day, and the burden of medicine costs is also a considerable amount, which is raised by their running around and soliciting donations. They have three goals: (1) Strive for genuine medicinal materials in the selection of medicinal materials, (2) Be careful in matching and preparing them, (3) Dispense medicines according to prescriptions, without omissions or errors. They are working hard according to these three goals.</p>
<h3>Annual Poor People's Shelters</h3>
<p>These annual shelters are a timely scene for winter relief. The northwest wind has been getting stronger and stronger recently, and the poor people on the streets are threatened by the severe cold. The shelters are stepping up preparations.</p>
<p>Before the war, the Chaozhou Guild Hall near the South Railway Station was borrowed for shelters every year. The main hall and the two halls there, and the land temple on the left, could accommodate seven or eight hundred people. Bamboo sheds were built in the open space inside the walls, which could also accommodate more than two hundred people. A total of more than a thousand people can be accommodated, but when there are many people, they cannot be accommodated as much as possible. Sometimes, other public places have to be borrowed as branch offices.</p>
<p>The Miserable Smile of Clinging to Life</p>
<p>This courtyard, which covers more than ten acres, is surrounded by walls made of red bricks. It is the place where these thousand homeless poor people are settled to spend the icy and snowy winter life. Pushing open the heavy iron gate, there is a rectangular counter on the right, with a clerk sitting on it, writing non-stop. This is the poor people's registration office. A large group of鸠形鹄面(scrawny-looking), wearing ragged cotton wadding, are squeezed chest to back, black and thin, forming a long snake formation. They stand along the counter, each declaring his name, age, native place, occupation, etc. This completes the registration procedure, and from then on, their food and accommodation are borne by the shelter. Looking at their faces, a miserable smile of clinging to life faintly floats.</p>
<p>The two sides of the hall are paved with wooden boards and padded with golden straw. Only a path is left in the middle, which is the poor people's bedroom. When sleeping, two people share a cotton quilt. During the day, they squat on the board铺(platform bed) like clay Buddhas, talking about the sky and the earth, some are catching lice, some are reading novels, and some are sitting face to face playing chess. The sallow and thin children also play there innocently.</p>
<p>Two Congees and One Meal a Day</p>
<p>The poor people eat two congees and one meal a day. Sometimes it is changed to three meals of congee, and there are also some pickles or radishes to go with the meal. When eating, every twelve people form a class, and there is another monitor in charge of supervision. The monitor is selected from the poor people, because their character and education level are relatively high, so they are given the title of monitor. When disbanding, those who serve cautiously are selected for awards.</p>
<p>There are no sanitary facilities in the shelter, but they also pay attention to the health of the greedy people. After the poor people register and enter the shelter, they must first eradicate their heads and bathe, and change their clothes, and each person gets a newly made set of cotton clothes and trousers. It is usually stipulated to take a bath four times a month and get a haircut twice. If someone gets sick, they are sent to the ward, where another nurse monitor is responsible. The nurse monitor accompanies them to the Xin Puyu Hall or Shanghai Hospital for diagnosis and treatment at any time.</p>
<p>The shelter has a period of three or four months every year, and when the weather is warm, it is given funds to disband. The poor people who are living on the streets can spend the winter well, and the meaning is very good. But after all, it is temporary. After the shelter closes, how will these thousand disbanded poor people live? If they can be given a corresponding job when they are taken in to cultivate their skills for making a living in the future, it will be of some help to society.</p>
<h3>The Heaven of White-Haired Elderly</h3>
<p>"Raise children to guard against old age, store grain to guard against famine." How pitiful are the solitary and helpless elderly. They cannot enjoy their twilight years in peace, nor do they have filial sons and obedient grandchildren to inquire after their well-being morning and evening. But seeing the elderly in the Old People's Home in the Nanshi area, many are carefree and laughing, seemingly unaware that old age and illness are the bitter experiences of life. In particular, the nuns provide meticulous service with loving smiles always on their faces. Whose family has such filial daughters and virtuous daughters-in-law in such a heartwarming scene!</p>
<p>The Old People's Home is located on Jichang Street, Wai Ma Lu, in the Nanshi area. Stepping through the crimson side door from the rugged city streets is like entering another world. More than 350 elderly people live here, including men and women, Chinese and foreigners. The oldest is in their eighties or nineties, and the youngest is sixty years old. It is said that there have been several over a hundred years old. Their silvery white hair accentuates their ruddy faces, making them appear very healthy. There is a vast garden where vitality can be seen in the tranquility. The elderly can spend their twilight years here, which is truly boundless happiness. Who wouldn't call it paradise on earth?</p>
<p>Elders' Clothing and Food - Obtained Through Donations</p>
<p>The elders' clothing and food all come from external donations. Due to financial difficulties, they have changed to two congees and one meal after the war. Downstairs, there are four large dining halls, which are very spacious. Each person has their own set of cutlery, stored separately in large drawers. Next to it is a very large kitchen, with a combination of Chinese and Western cooking equipment, sparkling clean pots, and iron carts for transporting food. It is just like a kitchen in a large restaurant. Two or three nuns regularly solicit donations from the outside world. Vegetable markets, large restaurants, and general stores are the main places where they arrange for food. Cartons of biscuits, whole chickens and ducks, canned food from foreign merchants' food shops, as well as fish, meat, and vegetables, are all donated by philanthropists. After cooking, the aroma is overflowing. The elderly eat both meat and vegetables every day, and they are truly blessed with good food.</p>
<p>The elderly's clothes are also inexpensive goods donated by various sectors. After being disinfected and modified, they are distributed to them to wear. There are also occasional pieces of fabric donated by silk shops or clothing stores. After careful mending by the nuns, they are pieced together to form colorful brocade clothes and quilts, which are both beautiful and generous. In various parts of Lingnan, the "Hundred Harmony Quilt," which is imbued with the meaning of blessings, is popular and is considered the most grand gift in weddings. The brocade clothes and quilts made by the nuns with great effort also contain the meaning of blessings, which can certainly win the hearts of the elderly.</p>
<p>Twenty-Five Bedrooms</p>
<p>On the second and third floors, there are a total of twenty-five bedrooms, each housing fourteen people. The single small iron beds are covered with clean sheets and matched with colorful brocade quilts. Those who don't know would think it's the inner chamber of the owner. There is also a small table next to the bed, where personal items are placed.</p>
<p>The elders live a very regular life. They get up early in the morning, take walks, and play games. When their physical strength is particularly good in the afternoon, they help with laundry or sweeping the house. There are also special spinning wheels for the elderly women to pass the time. Their work is purely for leisure and does not seek any work results, but most of them are proud to be able to work more. After dinner, if they still feel that the time is too early, they can join three or five old companions in the relaxation room to chat and laugh casually, recalling old events, which gives them a sense of rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Nuns Take Turns to Care</p>
<p>In the Old People's Home, there is a perfect sickroom set up for the elderly who are sick. The nuns take turns caring for them day and night. Their diet, living, and sleeping are all supported by them. Among them, there is an old woman in her seventies lying on the sickbed. Another trainee nun who graduated from Xu Hui Girls' High School and entered the hospital is kneeling in front of the bed to feed her. There are even more nuns taking care of her, making people recall the scene on the screen of serving the Empress Dowager. Many elderly people with slightly weaker physical strength are also supported by the nuns to bathe. Those who are deaf, blind, lame, or disabled need even more patient care. They also specially made many patient cars, which are pushed by the nuns in the garden, allowing them to roam and enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>The Old People's Home has a history of more than 100 years in Europe. In China, "respecting the elderly" is also an ancient tradition. However, in Shanghai, this Old People's Home is the only place of peaceful residence for the poor and helpless elderly. The nuns, who are determined to uphold chastity, recite scriptures and cultivate the Tao, and do not ask about world affairs, wholeheartedly serve the elderly. Each of them serves the elderly with a welcoming smile, as if serving their own loving parents. The more they work, the happier they feel, and the more joyful they are for the achievements of their own cause. This may be due to the fullness of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3>"Concentration Camp" for Abandoned Infants - Renji Infant Home, the "Social Parents"</h3>
<p>In Shanghai, it is unknown how many babies are abandoned every day. Most of them are abandoned by their parents because they are poor or have too many children and cannot afford to raise them. There are also many illegitimate children who are under the slander of society and the sanctions of etiquette. Parents have to give up responsibility. Who will raise this group of abandoned babies? Renji Infant Home has taken on the responsibility of these "social parents."</p>
<p>Renji Infant Home was originally one of the undertakings of Renji Shantang (Charity Hall). In the fourteenth year of Guangxu, Renji Hall used the remaining rooms in the hall to set up a "Baby Retention Bureau," specializing in raising abandoned babies, and specially hiring wet nurses to raise them, in order to fulfill the good virtues of God. However, due to the location and funding, everything was simple and crude. As the handling lasted for a long time, the reputation increased, and there were more and more sympathizers in the society. The funding was slightly sufficient, so the scale was slightly prepared, and the name was officially changed to Renji Infant Home. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, various affairs and gentry raised funds to purchase houses on Paoma Road to raise abandoned babies, which was considered to be on the right track. This Shanghai's only concentration camp for abandoned infants, separated by the vast racecourse, faces the International Hotel from afar, which is a very strong contrast.</p>
<p>Although Renji Infant Home is just a few old houses, seeing the five characters "Renji Infant Home" on the wall seems to emit the light of "human mutual assistance." As soon as you enter the gate, you can hear the cries of many newborns, whether lamenting the turbidity of the world or resenting the cruelty of their parents!</p>
<p>Workers' Nutrition</p>
<p>The infants housed in Renji Infant Home are raised with natural or artificial nutrients. The artificial nutrition department occupies two rooms, with more than 20 small iron beds arranged. On each bed lies a lovely baby. The babies' food is mainly milk powder and milk cakes. Sometimes, they also get a little fresh milk donated from the outside world, which is barely enough for nutrition. Nurses take shifts day and night to take care of them. Feeding and bathing have a set time, and the weight and temperature are measured once a day and recorded separately for doctors to check.</p>
<p>Natural Nutrition</p>
<p>The natural nutrition department is in three consecutive rooms on the east side, with forty or fifty small rattan hammocks arranged. A dozen wet nurses are hired to take on the work of raising them. Each person is assigned two or three babies. If there are too many babies, they will eat some milk powder, milk cake and other substitutes to make up for the lack of breast milk. There is also a female administrator who presides over the attendance and departure of the wet nurses.</p>
<p>They also pay attention to the health of the babies. All babies received are immediately inspected and diagnosed. The results of the examination are filled into the baby collection book separately. Western and Chinese doctors are hired on weekdays to treat sick babies in the hall. It is said that many poor parents do not have the heart to abandon them until they are terminally ill, so they often die before they can be treated. However, for abandoned babies, as long as there is still a breath, they will do everything possible to treat them. They really treat other people's children as their own.</p>
<p>Adoption Procedures</p>
<p>The babies raised in Renji Infant Home are allowed to be adopted by people who have no children. The procedure for adoption is to first fill out an application for adoption. After the hall has reviewed it, a blank guarantee is issued. The adopter and guarantor fill it out and send it to the hall. Then, the hall sends someone to investigate and confirms that they are of good background, have a proper occupation, and can afford the cost of raising the baby. After being notified by the hall, they can go to adopt the baby. They also send people to investigate the adopted babies at any time. If they are not satisfied, they will either issue a warning or take the baby back. However, at present, prices are high, and the economic situation is difficult. The number of people who are unable to raise their children and abandon them is increasing day by day, and the number of people who are able to adopt them is also decreasing day by day. Where can the Infant Home get thousands of rooms to accommodate them?</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Pushan Villa</h3>
<p>Pushan Villa is the largest coffin distribution organization in Shanghai. Whenever we see a truck painted with a blue cross driving on the road, we will think of the corpses and frozen bones on the street, which can also be buried in peace. They will not be exposed on the street, which really gives the deceased infinite comfort and obscures many phenomena of poverty in the prosperous city.</p>
<p>Pushan Villa was founded by philanthropist Wang Junsheng in the second year of the Republic of China, and has a history of 33 years to date. That winter, there were so many corpses on the street that it touched Wang's compassionate heart. He took out his own money to buy a piece of wasteland in Zhabei, specializing in distributing coffins and burying the deceased on the road. This is the origin of Pushan Villa.</p>
<p>Wang's</p>
<p>Over the years, his enthusiastic work has won the sympathy of the society, but Wang's own strength is not enough. Therefore, a board of directors was soon organized, and leaders from all walks of life were appealed to help. Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and others were hired as directors, which greatly helped the work, and the scope of the business gradually expanded. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, a general hospital was established on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, specializing in providing free childbirth for poor women, and in the summer, it also provided medical treatment for epidemic diseases. At the same time, Pushan Yixiao (Free School) was established near Pushan Villa to educate poor and out-of-school children. This is a more proactive job.</p>
<p>The main business of Pushan Villa is the work of collecting corpses and burying them. Therefore, more than 800 acres of land are leased in Dalian as a free cemetery. A part of this vast land is also designated as Pushan Cemetery, which is established for many people who have some assets but no land to bury them. After the Anti-Japanese War, the land in Dalian was requisitioned by the enemy to build an airfield. Therefore, they tried to change to Hongqiao in western Shanghai and leased more than 300 acres of farmland from the people. Later, because the coffins were full there, there was no gap. They also set up an open space in Qingpu Long, and continued to bury them.</p>
<p>The Battle of August 13th</p>
<p>Pushan Zihui made its best efforts and left a glorious trace in the history of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. At that time, the service personnel of Pushan Villa drove trucks to rescue the wounded soldiers in the rain of bullets, and to bury the heroes and compatriots who died in the war. At that time, an empty truck always returned fully loaded. The highest record was more than 70,000 corpses collected in one day. The intensity of the work can be imagined. Unfortunately, Pushan Hospital and Pushan Yixiao were destroyed by the artillery fire. Finally, Pushan Villa also sacrificed in the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Although Pushan Villa has been hit, the people in charge are not discouraged. They are sticking to their original intentions and starting again. They borrowed a simple house opposite the Central Grand Theater on Six Ma Road to engage in their restoration work. However, the scope of business can only be reduced, and only the distribution of coffins and the burial of corpses on the road are handled. At that time, the enemy's gasoline was strictly restricted, so rubber collapse cars were used to patrol the streets every day.</p>
<p>Four Thin Boards</p>
<p>After the poor die, they have no way to collect their bodies, and Pushan Villa is responsible for it. When the corpses on the street are reported by nearby residents or notified by the police station, they will come to collect them immediately. The criminals executed by the garrison headquarters are also collected and managed by them. The corpses collected by Pushan Villa are all equipped with a thin-board coffin and transported to the suburbs for burial. In summer, it is divided into two times in the morning and afternoon, because the time interval is too long, it will rot. The corpses of children are cremated, but they are also given a coffin as usual. At present, a coffin made of four thin boards is worth about 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Therefore, the amount of monthly expenditure of Pushan Villa is considerable. The families of the coffin depositors or donors are sometimes willing to take out some money and donate it to the villa. In addition, it all depends on the directors to maintain it. At present, in addition to the Yizhong of Panlong Town, the land of Hongqiao has expired after the victory. In addition, Dunxin Road has a workshop specializing in making thin-board wooden coffins, Wuding Road has a place for stacking empty materials, and Paomating Road has a place for temporarily placing corpses and coffins. The office is located at No. 210 Beihai Road.</p>
<h3>Xin Pu Yu Tang - Diverse and All-Encompassing</h3>
<p>Xin Pu Yu Tang is a large-scale charitable organization with an orphanage, infant home, old people's home, disability home, and a place for dispensing medicine and providing medical treatment. It is diverse and all-encompassing. It can be said to be the culmination of charitable undertakings. Xin Pu Yu Tang was founded by Mr. Lu Bohong and has a history of more than 30 years. Over the years, it has housed no less than 100,000 elderly, weak, disabled, orphans, and widows. Look at this vast area of 120 acres on the side of Guohuo Road in the Nanshi area. More than 20 Western-style buildings are hidden in the lush trees. The tranquil and elegant environment fully demonstrates the solemn and compassionate spirit of religion. It is simply not like a charitable organization, but a new society, a "Shangri-La" on earth!</p>
<p>The infant department houses fifty or sixty infants aged two or three, who are cared for by an Italian nun. Small beds are arranged inside, and there are small gauze nets on them. There are also many light blue strollers placed in the corridor. The children's apple-like faces often show innocence and vitality. Especially when they see the nun coming, the loving greetings, the warm smiles, and the whole courtyard are filled with love. It can really be said that these many children are all the dear children of this nun.</p>
<p>Sick Infant Department and Kindergarten</p>
<p>Children who are sick have a separate sick infant department, separated from normal children. It is said that when the infants first come, 80% of them are sick. After the nuns have carefully nursed them, they become strong and lively. They also raise a dozen dairy cows, all donated by enthusiastic people from the community. The infants have fresh and delicious milk to drink, and their nutrition is more adequate. The number of people who have been raised here and married off is not small. Behind the infant department is a Western-style building, which is the kindergarten department, housing seventy or eighty children, some of whom are sent from outside, and most of whom have grown up in the infant department. Children aged five or six have already begun to receive kindergarten education. They wear the same uniforms and rubber shoes, and sing and play there. When they are seven or eight years old, they are promoted to the next class. The boys go to Yixin Elementary School, and the girls live in another courtyard. There are spacious self-study rooms, clean dining rooms and bathrooms, and the upstairs is entirely bedrooms. They all wear blue shirts and black skirts and study at the affiliated voluntary school. Among them, there is a girl named Xuezhen, who was the only survivor of the more than 300 orphans who were killed when the National Army withdrew to the west in the 26th year of the Republic of China. When the nun talked about the story of rescuing orphans at the iron gate, Xuezhen's small eyes flickered with tears.</p>
<h3>The Home of the Older Sisters</h3>
<p>Another two-story Western-style building is the home of the older sisters. They were originally raised by the nuns in swaddling clothes. After so many years and so much effort, they are now all in their twenties, and they are older girls waiting to be married. After they finish elementary school, they are taught some needlework and cooking and other housework. Marriage is a major event in life, and the older sisters' marriages are very important. After being introduced to each other, they consider the other party's occupation and life. After both parties are satisfied, they choose a date to get married. As a rule, the married girls return to the hall to visit their relatives once a year, sometimes accompanied by their husbands and children. The children call the nuns grandmothers, and the nuns also treat them as their own daughters and sons-in-law, kindly telling them about their families.</p>
<p>Disability Home and Old People's Home</p>
<p>The disability home houses forty or fifty disabled people: blind people, deaf people, dumb people, lame people, idiots, etc. There are all kinds of disabled people. There is one person whose head is supported by a bookstand. It is said that otherwise it would hang upside down on his shoulders. There is also a young man of seventeen or eighteen whose legs have been taken away by someone. When you talk to them about their lives, they choke up and cannot go on, and tears keep streaming down.</p>
<p>The old people's home houses sixty or seventy old people over the age of fifty or sixty, most of whom are from poor backgrounds, but there are also one or two "outdated" old masters and ladies. Among them, there is an old lady Zeng who was the wife of a Daotai (provincial governor) in the former Qing Dynasty. She used to go to various places with her husband and can still speak various local dialects. Another old man from Hangzhou, surnamed Zhou, eloquently recounted his past life of war, and his family was destroyed by the war, which led him to fall to this point, and he could not help but feel sad.</p>
<p>Xin Pu Yu Tang also runs a very perfect hospital with more than a dozen bungalows, housing more than 100 sick infants and children. Many of them have incurable diseases. Knowing that they cannot be saved, the nuns always take care of them with all their heart as long as there is still a breath. The adult wards are divided into male and female sections, and the equipment is even more perfect. The outpatient department dispenses medicine and provides medical treatment, becoming a gathering place for patients in the Nanshi area, and it is even more lively in summer.</p>
<p>Run a Free School</p>
<p>In addition, they also run a free school to educate general poor children. There is a large kitchen that supplies meals for more than 1,000 people. They raise pigs, chickens, grow vegetables, and raise rabbits themselves to save expenses. It is indeed the largest charitable organization in the city. They raise orphans from swaddling clothes to adulthood, and then teach them the knowledge and skills to make a living. They choose spouses for the girls and marry them off, fulfilling the responsibility of being parents on their behalf.

<h3>Reader Consultation - Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Housing Dispute</p>
<p>Hu Liren respectfully asks: A has rented the entire building from B for many years and has always been at peace. At the end of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, A left Shanghai and went elsewhere, locking the house. Now B wants to unconditionally take back the house, but A is unwilling to move. Please ask: (1) A and B have not signed a lease. Can A refuse to move by arguing that it is an indefinite lease? (2) Is it legal for B to take back the house if it is indeed needed urgently? (3) Will A's refusal to move constitute a crime of forcible occupation? (4) If B directly invites someone to open the lock and occupy the house, is it an act of encroachment? (5) Is it legal for A to ask B for relocation expenses in order to resolve the matter?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui's Answer] (1) Yes; (2) There must be a need to take back the house for one's own use and conclusive proof; (3) It is a civil matter, not a criminal matter; (4) There is a suspicion of obstructing freedom; (5) This is not a legal issue.</p>
<p>(2) A Lackey of the Tiger</p>
<p>Zhang Zhengheng asks: My relative, Mr. Chen, is of upright character. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, his cousin extorted money from him but failed, and held a grudge in his heart. In October of the 26th year, the Japanese invaders captured Wuxi, and A organized a "Welcome the Imperial Army Association," forcibly donating money to the villagers and using the power of the enemy puppets to coerce Chen in various ways, and gathered people to destroy Chen's house. Chen was afraid of the lewd power at the time and did not dare to resist. Last year, the Japanese invaders surrendered, and Chen intends to recover the losses from A, but A denies it. Although the negotiations have been resolved several times, he only admitted his guilt with incense and candles. Now there are several legal questions, please give an answer. (1) What crime did A commit for forcibly donating money to the enemy? Can he use the excuse of protecting the village to escape punishment? (2) Is it possible to recover losses from him and punish him for advocating chaos for destroying other people's property and advocating that killing people in times of chaos is not a problem? (3) Is the evidence of A's crimes signed by eyewitnesses legally valid?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yapu's Answer] (1) There is a suspicion of aiding the enemy; (2) There is a suspicion of destruction, but pay attention that you must have suffered damage before you can claim compensation; (3) Valid.</p>

<h3>The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Industry Union Holds a Meeting - Factories Distributing Cotton Yarn Propose - Revising Cotton Yarn Prices - Distribution Methods to be Notified by the Distribution Committee</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Industry Union held a general meeting of members from factories distributing cotton yarn at 3 pm yesterday. Representatives from various factories attended, numbering around twenty to thirty people. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Wang Qiyu. Mr. Wang reported three points regarding the cotton yarn distribution method: (1) In addition to the yarn spindles used by each factory for weaving, the remainder will be distributed. (2) The remaining production volume of each factory, in addition to being allocated for the re-processed product industry and transported to South China for sale, will be re-distributed. (3) For the remainder of the second point, A. half will be transported to other ports by each factory, but must be transported after applying for approval from the Textile Management Committee. B. The remaining half will be sold by each factory. The distribution targets are limited to the business accounts of members of the Yarn Business Association or other members. If the re-processed product industry factories do not have enough cotton yarn allocated, it will be allocated appropriately. Furthermore, 1,500 pieces will be allocated from the remainder to retailers. The points reported by Mr. Wang were submitted to the meeting for discussion. Two points were then resolved: (1) The method of approving the points reported by the chairman shall be handed over to the distribution committee, and the factories shall be notified to handle them. (2) Market conditions in various industries are now changing. Taking raw cotton in this month as an example, the price has increased. The Price Negotiation Committee should re-negotiate the price based on the actual situation.</p>
<h3>Preventing Smuggling and Curbing Rising Winds - Customs Strictly Prohibits Gold Exports - Confiscation After Seizure and Severe Punishment</h3>
<p>The price of gold has skyrocketed in recent days, and speculators have pushed up the price. It is also reported that merchants from other ports are coming to Shanghai to search for purchases in an attempt to profit. It is learned that in order to suppress the price of gold, the authorities have decided to strengthen the crackdown on gold exports. The Customs and all relevant agencies have decided to strictly prohibit the export of gold bars, gold business, gold nuggets, gold coins, ore gold, gold sand, and all gold products (referring to those with the shape of ornaments or utensils made entirely or partially of gold and silver) in accordance with the "Measures to Prevent Smuggling and Carrying Gold and Silver for Export" previously promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. Those who must transport for export due to legitimate reasons shall first apply to the Ministry of Finance for an export passport and report it with the certificate. Otherwise, after seizure, it will not only be confiscated and confiscated, but those who violate other laws and regulations due to smuggling shall be severely punished.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the government authorities believe that the rise in the price of gold is enough to stimulate the rise in other prices. At a time when various major commodities are making every effort to suppress prices, they will never allow the price of gold to skyrocket. The Central Bank controls a lot of gold. Recently, a large number of gold has been transported from home and abroad. It has decided to continue to sell a large amount of gold without restrictions in order to suppress the rising wind. The Central Bank will also strengthen the tightening of communications so that speculators will be unable to manipulate it. Relevant authorities will conduct a thorough investigation of those who speculate and manipulate gold. Those who have real accounts will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Optimistic Outlook for People's Food Supply</h3>
<p>The previously severe food problem in this city has seen its reserve stocks become extremely sufficient since the authorities actively dredged the source. Although other commodity prices have fluctuated greatly recently, rice prices have remained stable. According to the responsible person in charge of food, the national harvest this year is abundant, with the harvest in the Yangtze River basin averaging over 80%, which is unprecedented in the past 30 years. Currently, national grain prices have generally fallen, especially in Chongqing, where rice is only 16,000 yuan per dan. Rice prices in various parts of Zhejiang Province have also fallen to over 30,000 yuan, with the price of new rice as low as 25,000 yuan per shi. As for Taiwan Province, after negotiation with the authorities, Taiwanese rice will be shipped to Shanghai. It is reported that 50,000 tons are waiting for loading and transportation to Shanghai in Keelung. Therefore, the future of the people's food supply is optimistic. Moreover, in order to plan ahead, the authorities have already transported a large amount of rice to this city and stored it in various warehouses. When necessary, it can be released at any time to curb the rise in rice prices.</p>

<h3>Rescuing the Tobacco Industry Crisis: Four Banks Undertake Tobacco Leaf Mortgage Financing at 60% Collateral for a Term of Three Months</h3>
<p>The Cigarette Industry Association of this city, etc., believing that the tobacco industry crisis is becoming increasingly serious, have submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for prompt relief, handling low-interest reconstruction loans for tobacco areas, and low-interest mortgage financing methods for state tobacco. The Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the Joint Office of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China for approval. Since the tobacco leaf production and processing loans were already included in this year's agricultural loan amount, there was no need for separate approval. Regarding the tobacco leaf mortgage financing, the Farmers Bank of China has formulated five principles for various bank branches to undertake tobacco leaf mortgage financing, which have been revised and approved by the Loan Review Committee, namely: (1) Mortgage financing of tobacco leaves is limited to improved varieties that can be used as cigarette raw materials; (2) It shall be handled in concentrated locations in production and sales areas; (3) Each factory or tobacco merchant can apply to the bank branch for mortgage financing at 60% of the purchase price of tobacco leaves from various places; (4) The mortgage financing of tobacco leaves can be converted into a mortgage loan after arrival, with a term of three months, which cannot be extended. Mortgage financing by tobacco merchants cannot be transferred into mortgage financing; (5) Those who meet the above principles can be handled and reported by each bank branch as they are done, within a limit of 200 million yuan, and a special report should be submitted to the Joint Office of the Four Banks every week.</p>
<h3>Developing China's Silk Industry: Starting with Improving Silkworm Eggs: The China Sericulture Company is Ordered to Draft a Five-Year Plan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The administrative authorities plan to use huge funds to support China's silk industry, starting with the improvement of silkworm eggs, to silk reeling and silk weaving. The production equipment and technology at each stage will be completely modernized, and the quality and production costs of silk will be able to sell well overseas. The China Sericulture Company has now been ordered to draft a plan, hoping that after five years, the private silk industry will no longer need government assistance and will have sufficient strength to compete with other countries. The upcoming Silkworm Egg Improvement Committee is the starting point for this effort, with the aim of collecting opinions from all parties in order to formulate a practical improvement plan. As for the opinions of representatives from all parties, they can be roughly summarized as follows: (1) Organize silkworm egg loans, a portion of which will be used to reform equipment, such as building low-temperature rooms, establishing mulberry gardens dedicated to young silkworms, and increasing mulberry gardens in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Another part is production loans, hoping to have 7 billion yuan, lent in installments, to be returned after the sale of eggs. (2) Reduce local varieties to improve the quality of silk cocoons. Please ask the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to implement this work conscientiously. (3) Estimation of the number of improved silkworm eggs to be distributed next spring: 600,000 sheets in Jiangsu, 600,000 sheets in Zhejiang, and a total of 50,000 sheets in Anhui, Guangdong, Shandong, and other provinces, totaling 1.25 million sheets. It is estimated that Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Yunnan can produce 1.05 million sheets by themselves, so another 200,000 sheets need to be imported from Japan. Half of these 200,000 sheets will be distributed to Zhejiang, and half to Jiangsu, Anhui, Guangdong, and Shandong. (4) Free buying and selling of silkworm eggs next spring. In addition, silk industry representatives were even more indignant about the wartime losses of the silk industry due to the refusal to transport Japanese cocoons to China, and planned to establish a National Silkworm and Silk Industry Loss Investigation Committee during the Anti-Japanese War in the short term, to submit accurate statistical figures to the Central Wartime Compensation Committee, so as to demand compensation from Japan in the future.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Credit Cooperative Opens Today</h3>
<p>Credit cooperatives are very common in European and American countries. Their business nature is entirely a civilian bank. In Shanghai, this type of organization is still a pioneering effort. The Shanghai Mortgage Credit Cooperative has been organized and is located at 251 Wusong Road. It is scheduled to open today. Its purpose is to facilitate the turnover of funds for all members. The business subjects are tentatively set as follows: (1) Accepting various deposits, (2) Handling small mortgage loans, (3) Handling mortgage loans for materials and warehouse receipts, (4) Handling acceptance of bills and discounting of bills, (5) Handling trust and warehousing business, (6) Investing in related cooperative businesses, (7) Acting as an agent for receiving and paying funds and entrusting various businesses.</p>
<h3>High Interest Rates and High Costs: The Silk Weaving Industry Faces a Serious Crisis: Loan Applications from Various Factories are Still Awaiting Approval from the Central Bank: We Have Missed the Opportunity in the Nanyang Market</h3>
<p>The various conditions for the loan for the electric silk weaving industry have not yet been approved by the Central Bank. According to Cai Tingtao, the chairman of the industry association, the current working capital needed by each factory is quite large, about several hundred billion yuan. This amount is lent by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to the Central Bank for rediscounting. Each weaving machine can be loaned 3 million yuan, and each factory is limited to 500 million yuan. The issue of loan collateral is still under discussion. The bank originally stipulated that 70% of the collateral should be raw material rayon, but manufacturers believe that it is unreasonable to mortgage raw materials and still produce. Later, it was agreed that 50% should be raw materials and 50% should be finished products. In the future, finished products can be gradually replaced with raw materials for further production when necessary. This agreement is still awaiting approval from Mr. Lin Fengbao, the director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, after he returns to Shanghai. The rumor that it has been approved is not true. According to Cai, the electric silk weaving industry is currently facing a severe crisis due to the pressure of high-interest funds and sluggish sales. The domestic market is unable to develop due to the impact of transportation. It is hopeless to open up the foreign market due to cost reasons. China has no rayon production at all, so all raw materials rely on Japan. Japanese rayon is currently 500,000 yuan per dan. The China Trust Bureau obtains this rayon through barter, and the rayon allocated to manufacturers is 2.8 million yuan per dan (3.8 million on the black market in this city). Finished products made from such expensive raw materials are naturally difficult to compete with Japanese goods, so our country has missed the opportunity in the Nanyang market.</p>
<h3>Responsible Person of the Income Tax Bureau Talks About Commercial Report Precautions</h3>
<p>Commercial Capital is Calculated in National Currency</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter visited the person in charge of the Income Tax Bureau to inquire about the precautions for commercial reports. According to the report: (1) Regarding the commercial report for the 34th year of the Republic (1945), if there are no account books as a basis, the bureau has a form for businesses to fill out. After filling it out, there should be no further objections to the income tax payable in the future. The completed form and written report should be sent to the bureau immediately for review. (2) Commercial reports for the 34th year of the Republic (1945) with account books as a basis need to include income, expenditure, surplus, or loss, budget statements, and other statistics. (3) Businesses that had two months of business operations in the 34th year of the Republic (1945) need to write and send in the commercial report for the 35th year of the Republic (1946) at the same time.</p>
<p>The reporter further inquired about the standard of commercial capital. According to the report: capital refers to the total amount of investment when the business started. If the funds are not legal currency, then this foreign currency needs to be converted into national currency according to the exchange rate at that time. If the headquarters of the business is in a foreign country, then the funds received by the domestic branch can also be used as capital. However, when the capital increases, the Income Tax Bureau will calculate the average amount of capital at the end of each month of that year.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices are Lower than the Price Ceiling: Flour Merchants are Unwilling to Collect Flour at the Price Ceiling: The Flour Industry Association Notifies Members to Return Flour Purchase Certificates</h3>
<p>Flour prices are lower than the price ceiling. Some flour merchants in this city are unwilling to follow the regulations of the Flour Industry Association for distributing flour. Instead of collecting flour from the association at the price ceiling and selling it with the flour purchase certificate cards of the cake, steamed bun, sliced noodle, and dough product industry associations, they directly purchase flour from flour factories, but still sell it with certificates. The Flour Industry Association believes that this is a violation of the rules, resulting in a daily decrease in the amount distributed by the association. In the future, if flour prices change, the members who violate the regulations will be responsible for not being able to obtain a sufficient amount of distributed flour or being reprimanded by the authorities. Yesterday, the association notified its members that if they believe that the distribution of flour is unprofitable, the procedure is troublesome, and they are unwilling to continue, they can send a letter requesting suspension of the distribution and send all the received purchase certificates to the association for verification and investigation.</p>
<h3>Commercial Common Sense: The Difference Between Pigments and Dyes</h3>
<p>Pigments and dyes are two completely different things. Not only are the commodity names different, but the properties and uses are also completely different. Chemical industry experts have already classified them in detail, but the general public still cannot completely distinguish between pigments and dyes, and even think that dyes are pigments. The Shanghai National Pigment and Sundries Industry Association has specially listed the differences between pigments and dyes for reference. They are listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Pigments</p>
<p>Vermilion, Cinnabar, Red Lead, White Lead, Gold Powder, Silver Powder, Litharge, Titanium Powder, Zinc Powder, Lithopone, Barium Sulfate, Barium Carbonate, Ink Ash, Charcoal, Pencil Lead Powder, Scarlet (Flower Red), Various Reds, Yellow, Yellow, Ochre, Azurite, Malachite (Buddha Head Green), Copper Filament, Malachite Green, Zinc Filament, Varnish Filament, Various Precipitated Pigments, Other Organic Pigments, Inorganic Raw Materials.</p>
<p>(B) Dyes</p>
<p>Sulfur Yuan, Black Electric Powder, Indanthrene, Sea Blue, Rapide, Indigosol, Naphthol, Indigo, Other Acidic, Direct, , Sulfurized, Mordant, Various Dyes</p>
<h3>Future Work of the Industrial Cooperative Association: Focus on Investigation and Research</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A responsible person of the China Industrial Cooperative Association told reporters: Many suggestions were provided by members at the meeting in Beijing. They are currently being sorted out, and special personnel will be sent to Beijing in the future to visit the authorities and make a request. As for the future work of the Industrial Cooperative Association itself, it should be to organize matters that members cannot handle independently, such as investigation and scientific research work. This requires members to bear considerable expenses in order to proceed.</p>

The content includes a brief biography of the main responsible persons of various banks, money shops, trust insurance, securities brokers in this city, as well as the organizational charter of financial institutions and relevant financial regulations, with a detailed description.</p>
<h3>Types and Systems of Occupational Insurance</h3>
<p>— Bu Renlin</p>
<p>Water insurance, fire insurance, war risk insurance, theft insurance, these are all insurances aimed at protecting property damage, and are insurances on things.</p>
<p>Occupational insurance is an insurance on personnel affairs, which is an insurance to protect the remuneration obtained from any occupation; if the remuneration of the practitioner is stopped, it can obtain considerable compensation to reduce the pain in life during unemployment.</p>
<p>The scope of occupation is very broad. According to the different modes of service, it can be roughly divided into:</p>
<p>(1) Free professions, such as doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Self-employed businesses, using funds, spirit, and labor to directly engage in agriculture, industry, and commerce.</p>
<p>(3) Appointment and employment, those who obtain remuneration by using spirit and labor through appointment and employment.</p>
<p>Freelancers rely on technical ability to obtain remuneration. The prosperity and decline of their affairs and the amount of their income are not fixed and unchangeable. Then we need to provide assistance and compensation to them when their business is idle and their income is insufficient. This responsibility should be borne by occupational insurance.</p>
<p>However: The business conditions and income of freelancers vary from person to person, from place to place, and from time to time, and are different. For occupational insurance, the amount of insurance can be proposed by the insured himself, but under what circumstances should the insurer compensate for the damage of the insured, and the amount of compensation is paid according to the amount of insurance? Or is it paid according to the actual amount of damage? How will the actual damage be based on the facts? To make a reasonable judgment; these many problems are difficult to solve in organizing insurance on personnel matters.</p>
<p>For insurance on things, the insurer must bear the responsibility of compensation for the losses suffered by the insured property due to force majeure: however, the occurrence of force majeure events is accidental;</p>
<p>Occupational insurance is insurance on people and things. The change of occupational status is entirely due to human factors. The prosperity and decline of the occupation, the amount of income, can be manipulated by practitioners, but except for themselves, there is no way to predict the policies and means they will implement in the business in the future.</p>
<p>Due to the variability of personnel affairs, to organize occupational insurance, it is necessary to divide various types of insurance and set up various systems according to the different occupations, the disparity of status and environment, so as to meet the needs of each actual situation and the scope of damage borne by the insurer; and to enable the insured to obtain the necessary amount of compensation when receiving damage compensation, so that the insurer can also pay reasonable compensation under the principle of concentrating strength and sharing risks.</p>
<p>Self-employed businesses are similar in nature to free professions; however, self-employed businesses, in addition to technical ability, require a large amount of capital for business operations. His degree of harm, in addition to business decline and insufficient income, has a greater harm responsibility for capital losses.</p>
<p>Regarding the property part of self-employed businesses, we can use property insurance (water and fire insurance, etc.) to bear his damage responsibility, but when the business declines, business is suspended, and the self-employed business owner's income is stopped, occupational insurance should be used to compensate him.</p>
<p>Those who obtain remuneration by using spirit and labor through appointment and employment, the reasons for the cessation of income are automatic resignation, changing careers, and passive dismissal, layoffs, and the dissolution of the service agency itself.</p>
<p>Occupational insurance, the responsibility it bears for the employed, is to assist life after dismissal and reduce the pain of unemployment.</p>
<p>According to the above description, it can be known that occupational insurance, due to the different status of the insured, the responsibility it bears is complicated and simple, the procedures are difficult and convenient, and the investigation of damage also occurs because there is no basis and it is easier to investigate.</p>
<p>Occupational insurance, only by adapting to the circumstances, can insurance systems be set up according to their different objectives.</p>
<p>Occupational insurance systems can be cited:</p>
<p>(1) Liability insurance system</p>
<p>(2) Occupational savings system</p>
<p>Free professions and self-employed businesses have a wide scope and complex changes in business conditions. It is difficult to have a clear basis for damage compensation, so only the savings system can be used to enable practitioners to engage in occupational savings. When income decreases and compensation is needed, the insurer will not only pay the principal and interest, but also provide specially stipulated damage compensation.</p>
<p>Those who are appointed and employed can be divided into the following categories according to the different service industries:</p>
<p>(1) Military</p>
<p>(2) Political</p>
<p>(3) Academic</p>
<p>(4) Industrial and Commercial</p>
<p>(5) Agricultural</p>
<p>Military and political affairs are national affairs, and schools are mostly run by the government, so layoffs and dissolution are occasional, while resignation, changing careers, and being dismissed are common;</p>
<p>The industrial and commercial sectors can be divided into the following categories according to employers:</p>
<p>(1) State-owned enterprises</p>
<p>(2) Company organization</p>
<p>(3) Partnership organization</p>
<p>(4) Sole proprietorship</p>
<p>State-owned enterprises and corporate enterprises have strong organizations, so the resignation, changing careers, and dismissal of employees are common; layoffs and dissolutions are occasional; however, layoffs and dismissals are more likely to occur in partnership organizations and sole proprietorships.</p>
<p>The hired workers in the agricultural sector are mostly temporary in nature; long-term hired workers are very few, so they are not .</p>
<p>Those who bear insurance responsibilities measure the probability of damage occurring to the insured. If the probability is high, the risk borne is high, and the insurer should increase the insurance premium and stipulate the scope of compensation conditions; if the possibility of damage is small, then reduce the insurance premium or even relax the conditions.</p>
<p>Employment liability insurance stipulates insurance premiums based on the size of the risk; separates the causes of damage, whether it is common or occasional, and stipulates the percentage of compensation; as for the insurance period, follow the fire insurance system and use the year as a unit.</p>
<p>The above is only a brief description of what has been seen. As for occupational savings, liability insurance, how many systems should be divided? When the insured suffers damage, how should the investigation procedures be carried out? Obtain conclusive evidence; how to prevent impersonation and fraud? How should the insurance contract be concluded? And so on, these issues require insurance experts to observe the social occupation situation, in accordance with the law, and conduct detailed discussions and designs.</p>
<p>As for the task of promoting occupational insurance, organizing groups is not as good as the insurance occupation taking on this responsibility.</p>

<h3>Japan Prepares to Enact New Basic Education Law</h3>
<p>[Rikai Corporation Tokyo, 24th] The Japanese government, in order to implement democratic education, is currently revising the existing "Basic Education Law" and preparing to submit a new Basic Education Law to the current ordinary session of the Diet for review and passage before implementation. The main purpose of the bill is that Japanese national education, which has traditionally regarded the "Imperial Rescript on Education" of the Meiji era as the central ideology of education, is no longer suitable for the times and must be changed. Future education should seek its roots in the ethics, philosophy, religion, etc. of ancient and modern times, and stipulate a nine-year compulsory education system, as well as important and specific issues concerning the training of teachers and new educational administration.</p>

<h3>Fu Bojing Discusses Yenching University's Financial Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The secretary to Ambassador Stuart, Mr. Chuan Bojing, stated: The current difficulty of Yenching University is the economic problem. Because the funds are all calculated in US dollars, although the current US dollar exchange rate is higher than before, the rise in prices has exceeded the multiple increase in the exchange rate. Therefore, it is actually a discount, and the school's funding feels stretched.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Carefully Studying the Issue of Opening Up Nationally Compiled Textbooks; The Seven United Office Has 100,000 Reams of Paper Stored, Awaiting Orders to Print</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Regarding the issue of opening up nationally compiled textbooks for primary and secondary schools, the Ministry of Education is taking a cautious approach to research. During the war, the joint supply by seven publishing houses was originally a transitional policy. In order to respect public opinion and suggestions from civil organizations, the Ministry of Education approved the participation of four publishers, including Children's Publishing House, after the victory. It is now reconsidering the opening up issue. The Ministry of Education's spokesperson publicly expressed the following opinions: (1) There are not many types of nationally compiled textbooks. The subjects for primary schools are still complete, while only a small number of nationally compiled textbooks in humanities are available for middle schools. (2) Textbook shortages are a common phenomenon in recent years and are not limited to nationally compiled textbooks. Taking Nanjing as an example, the English, chemistry, and geography textbooks used by the affiliated middle school of Central University are not nationally compiled, and there is no supply either. (3) Opening up textbooks is a normal approach, but the method adopted for opening up still requires careful study and prudent decision-making. It is reported that adopting nationally compiled textbooks during the war was a transitional measure, and opening up should theoretically be implemented after the victory. However, because the current situation of materials, transportation, and order in various places has not fully returned to the pre-war state, if the opening up is not carried out in a planned manner, the editing and printing will be done independently, without assigned responsibility, which may lead to a more severe textbook shortage and no books to supply. Moreover, textbooks are related to the national education policy and should be adapted to the actual situation of the times. It is heard that the Ministry of Education will designate relevant departments and the National Institute for Compilation and Translation to jointly establish an organization responsible for research and management. How to open up with conditions is still under research, and it is still early to decide on the announcement date.</p>
<p>[Another message] Regarding the issue of how to open up textbooks, a person in the publishing industry said: It must be resolved by around December 5th at the latest, because there cannot be sufficient time for printing and transportation to be delayed. It is learned that the Shanghai Seven United Supply Office currently has 100,000 reams of white paper stored, waiting to be printed, but is still waiting to see before receiving a clear order from the Ministry of Education.</p>

<h3>Japanese Elementary School Students Provided Meals</h3>
<p>[Rikai Corporation Tokyo, 24th] Colonel Smith, head of the Public Health Department of MacArthur's Headquarters, said today: Japanese elementary school children bring "bento" (Japanese lunch boxes) to school, and the rice and vegetables are cold and of poor quality, with insufficient nutrition. Headquarters is planning to enable schools to provide affordable food rich in protein and vitamins. However, there is currently a shortage of food and fuel, and there are a large number of elementary school children in the country. Initially, it will only be implemented in Tokyo and gradually expanded. It is planned to allocate 5,000 tons of grain from Japanese relief supplies, and the Food Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be responsible for supplying vegetables. As for meat, 5,000 tons will be taken from the canned meat sealed up from the Japanese army and navy and quickly distributed to various schools. This plan may be implemented in the coming year.</p>

<h3>Civil Service Performance Evaluation Should be Strictly Implemented in Accordance with the Law; Municipal Government Complies with Orders and Instructs Subordinates to Take Note</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government has received an order from the National Government stating that the year-end performance evaluation and regular assessment of civil servants should be given equal importance so that the judgments can be accurate and the rewards and punishments can be fair. Although there has been much progress in the handling of year-end performance evaluation and regular assessment by various agencies during the extraordinary period, the inertia of old habits has not fully played the due role. There are also cases of delays or negligence, which are not in line with the way to eliminate the turbid and purify, comprehensively check the names and verify the reality. Since the restoration, there are many political affairs to be undertaken. It is hoped that civil servants at all levels will be diligent and strive to carry forward the spirit of hardship and perseverance during the war to jointly govern. It is hoped that the chief officials of all agencies will rectify themselves and set an example of law-abiding, public service, and practical progress. Year-end performance evaluation and regular assessment of personnel should be strictly implemented in accordance with the law to eliminate the inferior and retain the good, and the rewards and punishments should be fair and appropriate, so as to maximize efficiency. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government has issued orders to its subordinates to comply.</p>

<h3>A Scene from a Henan Farce: Fangcheng County Magistrate Privately Uses Military Grain Funds; Director of Land Administration Bureau Suspected of Receiving Funds on His Behalf; Kaifeng News on the 16th; Wang Shoumei, Our Correspondent in Bian</h3>
<p>The Henan Disaster Relief Appeal Group, bearing the blood and tears of 30 million disaster victims in Henan Province, has been running around in Beijing and Shanghai for more than two months and has just returned. Representatives from various counties have flocked to the provincial capital for help like a tide. In the midst of the Provincial Assembly's calls for the government to cut staff and reduce administration in order to rescue the disaster victims of the entire province, a farce has been staged in the Henan officialdom. This farce is a great satire on Henan politics. At the same time, due to the serious accusations from the media and civil organizations, it is said that some important people and county magistrates who have not yet revealed their true colors have begun to be busy and preparing to "pack up" and quickly return the military grain funds that have been embezzled or swallowed to the people without leaving a trace.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zuo'an Plays the Lead Role; Fan Zuomin Plays a Supporting Role</h3>
<p>In the performance of this farce, Zhao Zuo'an, the county magistrate of Fangcheng, plays the lead role, Fan Zuomin, the director of the Henan Provincial Land Administration Bureau, and Xue Binqing, the staff member of the Fangcheng County Grain Administration Section, play supporting roles. There is also one pitiful wronged person, namely Zhu Wenbin, the chief of the Fangcheng Grain Administration Section, who can be regarded as a supporting role of a supporting role. The plot is the private use of 129 million yuan of Fangcheng's military grain funds for illegal operations. The entire play is still being performed. It is not yet possible to determine how many acts and scenes it should be divided into. Now, only a systematic report is made on the origin and evolution of this case based on the information obtained by the reporter from five days and nights of non-stop investigation:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Food purchases military grain in Gu Province, not on a cash-on-delivery basis, and often delays it for a year and a half or three months or two months. No one knows when it will be sent to the province, no one knows when it will be sent to the county, no one knows when it will be sent to the townships, and no one knows when it will be sent to the people! The people think it is right to produce grain. Sending the price is considered a favor from the superiors. This favor is often a moon in the water and a flower in the mirror, which is desirable but unattainable. Even if it is sent to the Township Office, it is offset left and right, and after it is all offset, just tell the people, and the people will be very grateful. All crows in the world are generally black. For many years, this situation has been so common that it is not surprising. This social environment and political atmosphere are one of the reasons why Zhao Zuo'an muddied the waters. Secondly, Zhao Zuo'an's upper-level relations are very smooth, and he is very close to the so-called "Four King Kongs." The "Four King Kongs" in Henan do have the power to "turn the world upside down." Having such a hard and powerful backer has created a sense of fearlessness for him. This is another reason why Zhao Zuo'an dared to act recklessly. Based on the above two reasons, he probably had been thinking about "making a fortune" for a long time.</p>
<p>In early June of this year, the Ministry allocated a batch of military grain funds to the Henan Provincial Agricultural and Grain Administration. Among these military grain funds, there were 129 million yuan of Fangcheng's military grain funds for March to June of the thirty-fourth year. The Provincial Agricultural and Grain Administration immediately ordered Fangcheng County in the same month to prepare a document and send someone to the province to collect the funds. County Magistrate Zhao Zuo'an immediately sent Xue Binqing, a staff member of the County Grain Administration Section, to the province with an official document and seal to collect the funds. After Xue arrived in the province, the Provincial Agricultural and Grain Administration did not sign the check because the seal on the submitted document did not match. At that time, County Magistrate Zhao happened to come to the province to attend an administrative meeting and immediately went to the Agricultural and Grain Administration to negotiate and ask the person in charge to write down the inconsistencies in the procedures and return them to the county for correction. The person in charge of the Agricultural and Grain Administration immediately complied. After Zhao returned to the county, it happened that there was news of a change in the chief of the County Agricultural and Grain Administration Section. The original chief of the Agricultural and Grain Administration Section, Zhu Wenbin, was preparing to come to the province. Zhao Zuo'an gave the corrected document to Zhu Wenbin to take to the province to assist Xue Binqing in handling the fund collection procedures. At the same time, Zhao Zuo'an wrote a letter to Fan Zuomin, the director of the Provincial Land Administration Bureau (one of the "Four King Kongs"), saying that the fund collectors had something to report in person and requested an audience. The letter was taken to the province by Zhu Wenbin. After Zhu arrived in the province and handed the document to Xue Binqing, he sent the Zhao letter to Director Fan Zuomin. Fan agreed to handle it on his behalf. Zhu did not stay in the province for long and returned to the county. Since then, he has not seen Xue Binqing, and the military grain funds have also disappeared.</p>
<h3>Military Grain Funds Exceeding One Hundred Million: Waited and Waited, But Nothing Seen</h3>
<p>According to a report by Sun Luzhan, Secretary of the County Council, the County Council Speaker Xiao stated: "On August 2nd, I met Xue Binqing in Bian. According to him, the military grain funds have all been handed over to Fan Zuomin, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, for civilian use." As a result, all sectors of the county were quietly waiting for this batch of 129 million yuan in military grain funds. However, they waited and waited, but nothing was seen. By early September, the County Council truly could no longer remain silent. It formally questioned County Magistrate Zhao through official channels, asking where the military grain funds had gone and requesting a response from County Magistrate Zhao. However, County Magistrate Zhao kept prevaricating and did not reply. With no other choice, various agencies dispatched representatives to the province to investigate. Sun Luzhan represented the County Council, Yuan Ziyu represented the Youth League, and Zhu Wenbin, the former Chief of the Grain Administration Section, totaling three people, left the county on September 7th to investigate in the province. At that time, various newspapers in Bian published news of the "Missing Military Grain Funds in Fangcheng." After detailed investigation, it was discovered that this large sum of money was issued a check by the Provincial Field Grain Division on July 18th, with the check number being 1237, 661985. Xue Binqing cashed it at the Central Bank on July 19th. When the representatives questioned Director Fan Zuomin, he stated that he had handled 110 million yuan, and the remaining 19 million yuan was taken to Luohe by Xue Binqing. After repeatedly urging Director Fan Zuomin to quickly hand over the original funds and remit them to the county, Director Fan Zuomin delayed on the grounds that the remittance route was blocked. Later, after more than ten days, on September 17th, 18th, and 24th, respectively, 80 million yuan was remitted to Xuchang, and 10 million yuan each was remitted to Xiangxian and Yexian. The representatives brought back 10 million yuan in cash. (The above investigation process can be seen in Sun Luzhan's telegram to County Magistrate Zhao and Sun's signed report to Speaker Xiao.) However, by this time, the case had already attracted the attention of many people in Shacheng.</p>
<p>In early October, County Council Speaker Xiao and Deng Xiang of Fangcheng County went to Kaifeng and formally filed a complaint with the relevant agencies. The newspapers in Shacheng also published this news in a prominent position every day. At the same time, it happened that Director Gu and Zhu Tong arrived in Bian. After reading the newspaper, he learned about the case and heard that General Gu had personally instructed Chairman Liu to thoroughly investigate and severely punish it. Chairman Liu was probably shocked at this time. He felt that his subordinates were deceiving him. He was very sad and very angry. At the same time, because of the exposure and accusations of the case in various newspapers, Chairman Liu was even more angry. In a fit of anger, he decided to dismiss Zhao Zuoan at the beginning of this month and escort him to the province for strict punishment according to law. At the same time, Xue Binqing, the main culprit in the case and the grain administration clerk of Fangcheng, and Zhu Wenbin, the former chief of the grain administration section who was involved in the case, were also detained and brought to the province for interrogation. Two days before Zhao Zuoan and others were escorted to the province, the Fangcheng County Association in Bian decided to raise three questions to Zhao Zuoan and drafted a notice with these questions, which was sent to the Bianyuan newspaper offices on October 5th for publication. Since the notice involved Fan Zuomin, Director of the Provincial Land Administration Bureau, Fan sent senior officials from the Land Administration Bureau to lobby that day. As a result of the lobbying, most of the newspapers did not receive the notice. Only the Henan Minguo Daily received the notice. Moreover, because of the urgent operation, the newspaper had already typeset the original notice and was about to print it, and refused to withdraw the edition. The personnel who went to operate reported back to Director Fan, who was very anxious and uneasy. Therefore, late that night, he personally went to the Henan Minguo Daily and asked President Zhao Peiwu of the newspaper to cancel the notice. At that time, 4,004 copies of pages two and three of the Minguo Daily had already been printed, and the original notice had been printed on page one. After repeated discussions, Zhao agreed that Fan would purchase all the printed newspapers at the original price of 150 yuan per copy at an 80% discount, totaling 480,480 yuan. He also paid an overtime fee of 70,000 yuan, totaling 550,480 yuan, to withdraw the original notice. As a result, no one knew the content of the notice. However, on the 6th, many people in Kaifeng knew about this incident. According to a reporter who learned from an investigator at the Supervisory Envoy's Office, the original text of the notice was as follows: "Notice from the Fangcheng County Association in Bian Questioning County Magistrate Zhao Zuoan: Since the Anti-Japanese War, Fangcheng has suffered from natural and man-made disasters, with deep wounds and pain, and the people cannot live. In the 34th year, when collecting military grain, in addition to the extreme poverty, we still uphold the meaning of 'contributing everything we have to the country,' and painfully transported the blood and sweat earned from a year of hard work. As the shepherd of the people, how can you feign ignorance of this situation? The superiors, mindful of the people's difficulties, allocated the funds early. In order to eliminate corruption, the amount of grain price due to each county was published in the major newspapers of the provincial capital, and the people of the whole of Henan have witnessed it. However, the 129 million yuan for the Fangcheng grain price from March to June disappeared after you, the magistrate, claimed it. The people have been waiting anxiously, but there is no news. After public recommendation, Sun Luzhan, Secretary of the County Council, Yuan Ziyu, representative of the Youth League, and Zhu Wenbin, former Chief of the Grain Administration Section, went to Bian to inquire in various ways. They learned that you, the magistrate, withdrew the funds from the Central Bank on July 18th and handed over 110 million yuan to Fan Zuomin, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, to engage in business like Tao Zhu. The rest ordered Clerk Xue Binqing to take it to Luohe for 'special light management.' Secretary Sun met Fan Zuomin, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, on September 25th (possibly a mistake for September 15th) and strongly stated the suffering of the people of Fangcheng. Fan finally agreed to hand over 10 million yuan in cash, 80 million yuan to Xuchang, and 10 million yuan each to Wan and other counties. The shortfall will be returned by Xue when he returns. The facts are provided, and there are telegrams from the staff and you, the magistrate, as evidence. Now, this association has decided to raise three questions to you: (1) The people of Fangcheng are poor and desolate. The above-mentioned military grain price has been taken out for nearly three months. How can you bear to hand over this money to others for remote use? (2) It is strictly forbidden to use public funds for business. Clerk Xue Bin of your grain administration office took the money to Luohe and has been staying there without returning. Whether the remaining money is remitted in installments to various places violates the official regulations? (3) Since you, the magistrate, used this money for 'Tao Zhu's business,' calculating at the usual interest rate of 2% per month, the profit is no less than 60 or 70 million. Should this income be included in your private pocket? We hope that you will give a clear answer to the above three items as soon as possible. This money must be borne by every man, woman, and child among the 400,000 people in Fangcheng, and it is the kindness of the central government. Everyone is looking forward to it like a drought expecting rain. We hope that you will donate a small amount and tell the truth frankly! Association Address: No. 17, Houjie Street, Sansheng Temple."</p>

<h3>After the Incident of the Notice, Suspicions in Society Increased</h3>
<p>Since the small episode of publishing the notice, people in the society have become increasingly suspicious of Director Fan. The supervisory and disciplinary agencies have also paid special attention to Fan. As a reporter, I have always followed the eyes of the general public. Wherever everyone looks, I pay special attention to it. Fan has naturally become one of the important interview targets for reporters. However, Fan has been very mysterious these days, and even his shadow cannot be seen. It is said that he goes out at dawn and returns late at night, looking dejected and flustered, running around and lobbying everywhere. But this does not reduce his suspicion. On the contrary, because of his appearance, the investigators of the supervisory and disciplinary agencies are even more careful in their investigation. According to the most reliable news obtained by the reporter from the investigators, the process of receiving the money at that time, the situation of distribution after receiving the money, and the situation of withdrawing and remitting the money after the incident are as follows: On July 18th, the Henan Provincial Field Grain Office issued a check for 129 million yuan for Fangcheng military grain price, with the check number being 1227, 661985. On July 19th, Xue Binqing went to the Central Bank and withdrew all the money. However, Xue only took 29 million yuan, deposited 10 million yuan in Huiyuan Bank, and temporarily deposited the remaining 100 million yuan in the Central Bank in the name of "Visitor." On July 23rd, Shi Shunhua of Huiyuan Bank, holding the "Visitor" passbook, went to the Central Bank and withdrew 70 million yuan. On August 1st, Shi Shunhua of Huiyuan Bank again took the "Visitor" passbook to the Central Bank and withdrew 30 million yuan. Xue Binqing took the 19 million yuan he received and bought 100 pieces of cloth, 4 bags of heroin, and 5 large boxes of record paper in Bian, and transported them to Luohe accompanied by Wang of Fangcheng. (Another investigator confirmed that the 5 large boxes of record paper were purchased from Da You Paper Factory in Bian and have not yet been shipped.) The remaining 110 million yuan was deposited by Fan Zuomin in Huiyuan Bank in the name of "Fang Ji," and then used the Bank of China as a springboard to deposit the money in China, Jiaotong, and Jincheng Banks, and finally all deposited in Huiyuan Bank. (Note: Huiyuan Bank is a private bank composed of important figures in the military, political, and financial circles of this province.) How the money was withdrawn secretly and what activities were carried out during the period of deposit in Huiyuan Bank is still under investigation by the Supervisory Envoy's Office. According to unconfirmed news, the money has been taken to Shanghai to purchase goods, and the goods have been transported to Xuzhou, waiting for news to be transported to Bian.) And in September, the representatives of Fangcheng came to the province to investigate the money. Fan Zuomin and Huiyuan Bank said that the money had been used for other purposes and could not be raised for a while, and they were afraid of being exposed. Therefore, during those days in mid-September, Huiyuan Bank's funds were extremely tight. If someone went to the bank to withdraw money or make private loans, the person in charge of the bank would say: "We have no way to raise 70 million yuan in urgent funds these days!" However, the representatives of Fangcheng kept begging bitterly. With no other choice, Fan Zuomin and Huiyuan Bank jointly went out to lobby. Because Huiyuan Bank had frequent dealings with various banks, they obtained a receipt from China, Jincheng, and Jiaotong Banks (20 million yuan from the Bank of China, 35 million yuan from the Jiaotong Bank, and 4.6 million yuan from the Jincheng Bank), totaling 59.6 million yuan in cash. Huiyuan Bank took a check for 24 million yuan (check number B038639, account number 742), totaling 83.6 million yuan. On September 17th, Director Fan personally went to the Provincial Bank in the name of "Fang Ji" and remitted 80 million yuan to the Xuchang Provincial Bank (Fangcheng is closer to Xuchang, and there is no bank in Fangcheng). After deducting the remittance fee, there was a balance of 3,173,333 yuan. Director Fan did not consider that someone would come to check the accounts later, so without even thinking about it, he asked the Provincial Bank to deposit the more than 3 million yuan in the Land Administration Bureau's temporary account. Director Fan later regretted this very much, but the investigators regarded this as precious evidence. On September 18th and 24th, 10 million yuan each was remitted to Xiangxian and Yexian by the Provincial Bank.</p>
<p>On the 13th, Zhao Zuoan and others had already been escorted to Bian and detained by the Security Command. Chairman Liu, fearing that these criminals would collude with each other, personally issued an order prohibiting the criminals from meeting with the outside world. Director Fan Zuomin tried every means to meet Zhao Zuoan. It is said that Chairman Liu also wrote a note allowing him to meet, but he was blocked by the guards. On the 14th of this month, Liu Wenbin, the investigation section chief of the Henan-Shandong Supervisory Envoy's Office, went to the Provincial Security Command to interrogate Zhao Zuoan, Xue Binqing, Zhu Wenbin, and others. It is reported that Zhao Zuoan confessed that he did not know anything about the fraud in this case, and that Xue Binqing and Fan Zuomin should be responsible. Xue Binqing confessed that he was ordered by County Magistrate Zhao to go to the province to collect the money, and that he did not know anything about the fraud after the money was handed over to Director Fan. Zhu Wenbin, because he did not participate in the collection of money from beginning to end, of course could not ask anything.</p>
<p>These days, everyone in Shacheng is talking about this case. Some are praising it, some are denouncing it, some are feeling sorry for their own kind, and some are harboring ulterior motives and echoing it. It is a busy time for Jingang, and it is also a busy time for a large number of investigators from the Supervisory Envoy's Office. Chairman Liu is sick and does not work or see guests, but it is said that he attaches great importance to this case. It is said that because he wants to strictly handle the case, he does not advocate sending the entire case to the court. He wants to use military law to handle it more quickly. Many cold-eyed people are staring, waiting to see if Chairman Liu has the determination to kill two corrupt officials:</p>
<p>The Supervisory Envoy's Office summoned Fan Zuomin this afternoon. Fan looked flustered and said about the case: "Helping friends has led to this trouble. I really didn't expect it! This time, I collected the military grain price for Fangcheng. At that time, the delay was caused by the inconvenience of remittance, which caused misunderstandings from all parties. I am very sad." He also said: "I hope that this case will not be expanded. If it is expanded, I am afraid that too many people will be involved and affect the overall situation..." According to a senior investigator from the Supervisory Envoy's Office, the evidence for the entire case has been collected completely, the investigation is over, and the indictment is being sorted out and will be issued soon.</p>
<p>This ugly drama is too ugly, because of its performance, the Henan political stage has become dirty. When will it end? From what time will this kind of ugly drama never be staged on the Henan political stage? Everyone is suffering and hoping in grief and anger!</p>
<p>After Yuan Shikai dissolved the Kuomintang, in December of the second year of the Republic of China, he convened a political conference. Its main tasks, in addition to dissolving the National Assembly and the provincial assemblies, were to revise the Provisional Constitution. On January 24th of the third year, the Regulations on the Organization of the Legislative Conference were agreed upon, and the Legislative Conference was established. At the meeting, Yuan sent the outline for amending the Provisional Constitution to the meeting. After it was approved, Yuan promulgated it on May 1st of the third year of the Republic of China. The content of the new constitution greatly increased the power of the president. In December of the fourth year of the Republic of China, Yuan declared himself emperor. The provinces rose up to denounce him. Yuan knew that the general trend was over and ordered the restoration of the republic, still calling himself president. He soon died of illness. Li Yuanhong took office as president, restored the Provisional Constitution of the first year of the Republic of China, reconvened the National Assembly, and organized a Constitutional Conference to continue working based on the Tian Tan draft constitution. In June of the sixth year, Zhang Xun entered Beijing, and the National Assembly was dissolved for the second time, and the constitutional work was again shelved.</p>
<p>Because of the issue of participating in the war, the Duan Qirui Cabinet and the National Assembly had different opinions. Li, under the pressure of force, issued an order to dissolve the National Assembly, and then resigned as president. Feng Guozhang succeeded him and still appointed Duan as premier. Feng and Duan were in power, disregarding the old National Assembly, and formed a temporary Senate, which discussed and agreed on the National Assembly Organization Law and Election Law, which were formally promulgated by Feng in the seventh year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The Founding Father believed that the Beijing government's tacit approval of Li's illegal dissolution of the National Assembly violated the spirit of the covenant and went to Guangdong to advocate the protection of the constitution. The members of the Senate and House of Representatives who went south formed an extraordinary meeting, declared that the formal National Assembly and the Constitutional Conference's review committee would be reopened, but no concrete results were obtained. Therefore, in January of the ninth year, Speaker Lin Sen announced the temporary suspension of constitutional discussions.</p>
<p>In June of the eleventh year, Li Yuanhong resumed his position as president and revoked the order to dissolve the National Assembly for the second time. The National Assembly was able to convene in Beijing and agreed to complete the constitution before the end of August of the twelfth year and to hold presidential elections before the end of September. Unexpectedly, in June of the twelfth year, Li was forced to step down again. The members of the National Assembly moved south one after another. Northern politicians did not hesitate to bribe members to move south. A part of them even returned north again, and the National Assembly convened in September. On October 5th, Cao Kun's bribery election was completed, and he was elected president with 480 votes. The constitution was also hastily passed and promulgated within a few days.</p>
<p>In November of the thirteenth year, Duan Qirui took office as executive, without convening the National Assembly or recognizing the constitution that had been hastily passed in the twelfth year, but only promulgated the Regulations on the Post-Affairs Conference. In February of the fourteenth year, he continued to promulgate the Regulations on the National Representative Conference, whose task was to formulate the constitution and its implementing rules. Duan also organized a Constitution Drafting Committee, which passed a draft constitution of the Republic of China. However, the organization of the committee itself was questionable and had not been submitted to the National Representative Conference for resolution.</p>
<p>After the death of the Founding Father, the Political Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang resolved to reform the Revolutionary Government into the National Government and passed the National Government Organization Law, which was the ancestor of the fundamental organization law of the National Government of our country. In March of the sixteenth year, the National Government was reorganized and the National Government Organization Law was revised. In February of the seventeenth year, it was revised again. In October of the same year, the Five-Power Constitution was officially promulgated and adopted, still called the National Government Organization Law.</p>
<p>In November of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved to convene a National Convention. The National Convention was held in Nanjing on May 5th of the twentieth year and formulated 89 articles of the "Provisional Constitution of the Period of Political Tutelage," which was promulgated by the National Government on June 1st and was the fundamental law of the period of political tutelage.</p>
<p>The brewing of the Chinese constitutional movement gradually matured after these several attempts and setbacks. In December of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Kuomintang was held and resolved to convene a National Assembly to formulate a constitution and end political tutelage. After more than three years of preparation, the Fifth Five Constitution Draft was promulgated, which was the constitutional blueprint discussed in this National Assembly.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of Nai Bili's Trip Abroad: Quoting a Proverb: A Narrow Place Can Be Lived in, But a Narrow Mind Cannot Get Along</h3>
<p>— Our Travel Reporter Huang Jiesun sent from Bangkok on the 29th</p>
<p>Siamese Elder Pali (also known as Nai Bili) first traveled to our country by special plane during his trip abroad to visit the major powers. This is a grand event after the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Siam, and it is also a milestone in the diplomatic relations between China and Siam. Whether the diplomatic relations between China and Siam can be further advanced and whether Siam, which is suffering from the difficulties of being controlled by others, can get rid of its difficulties depends entirely on the results of this trip by the elder. On the eve of Pali's departure, he said to reporters: I have the opportunity to visit China this time. For me, it is an opportunity to increase my knowledge, but the other task is to make the diplomatic relations between China and Siam closer. In short, my visit to your country can include three points: first, to enhance the friendship of the allied countries; second, to pay tribute to Chairman Chiang. I and the people of Siam are very grateful for Chairman Chiang's constant insistence on helping Siam to protect the integrity of Siamese territory and sovereignty. During the Anti-Japanese War, I heard Chairman Chiang's statement on the radio that the Chinese group would support Siam to the end, which really strengthened my determination to resist Japan. Third, as Ambassador Li said, the Chinese government and all the people do not regard my visit to your country as a distant guest, but invite me with the love of a brother, and I feel infinite comfort. At the same time, it also reminds me of two proverbs: "A narrow place can be lived in, but a narrow mind cannot get along." Due to the solemn and sincere expression of the Chinese government and people, the relationship between the two countries is already in an extremely close state.</p>
<p>Luan Pali, also known as Nai Bili, was born in the Siamese province of Ayutthaya and is 47 years old. His ancestral home is Xiatang Township, Chenghai, Guangdong. His Chinese name is Chen Jiale. Bili means "happiness" in Siamese, which is taken from the word "le". There are four brothers. Luan Pali is the eldest. His second brother, Hanchu, was educated in China and is now the president of Ayutthaya Bank in Siam. His third brother is currently the Siamese ambassador to Switzerland; his fourth brother is deceased.</p>
<h3>Review of the Constitutional Movement: From the Provisional Constitution to the Fifth Five Constitution Draft</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Archive</p>
<p>After the Wuchang Uprising, fourteen provinces successively declared independence, but they all acted on their own and did not seek each other. The governors of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces advocated the establishment of a unified government organization. On the twenty-fifth day of the ninth lunar month in the Xinhai year, a meeting of provinces was held in Shanghai, which recognized Wuchang as the central military government of the Republic of China, and the governor of the Hubei army carried out central government affairs. In response to the request of the governor of Hubei, the provinces sent representatives to Wuchang to discuss the organization of the provisional government. As a result, on the thirteenth day of the tenth month, the outline of the "Organization of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China" was passed, which was the first fundamental law after the establishment of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Shortly after the recovery of Nanjing, the Founding Father returned to China from Europe and was elected as the provisional president and established the Nanjing government. On January 28th of the first year of the Republic of China, after the establishment of the Senate, a drafting committee for the constitution was organized to engage in the drafting of the provisional constitution. After its completion, it was promulgated by the president on March 11th and was called the "Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China".</p>
<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Expanding Banking Business</h3>
<p>— Yu Zengkang</p>
<p>In recent years, numerous banks have been established, creating a flourishing scene unprecedented in history. Is this truly genuine prosperity? However, in reality, improper business practices have reached an extreme. Banks have abandoned legitimate business operations, pursuing only high profits. In this pursuit, they resort to any means, providing assistance to speculators or engaging in usury. Some even directly engage in speculative hoarding, hoping for temporary gains. Such business development deviates from the original purpose of establishing banks. Is this truly beneficial to the banks themselves? Banking prosperity built on speculation and usury cannot last, as past precedents have repeatedly shown. Why then does the banking industry repeat its mistakes without seeking to extricate itself, and instead continues to deepen its predicament, leading to lurking crises? The reasons can be attributed to the following:</p>
<p>(1) Although China's banking industry has experienced remarkable development, the overall system is not yet soundly established. Consequently, the direction of development is often determined by the economic environment. The current economic situation is worsening, making banking operations even more unreasonable. The ineffectiveness of past passive management is evidence of this.</p>
<p>(2) The financial strength of China's banking industry has always been weak. Today, numerous small banks and financial institutions compete, further dispersing financial power. Moreover, deposits are declining both in quantity and quality. Therefore, available funds have decreased to extremely low levels, rendering banks incapable of financial regulation. Furthermore, rising costs and substantial expenses add to the difficulties, inevitably forcing banks to deviate from the right path, pursuing high profits to sustain themselves.</p>
<p>(3) China's financial sector and industry have traditionally been disconnected. With industry and commerce now deeply mired in crisis, the banking industry is naturally unwilling to provide further regulation of industrial credit.</p>
<p>This unreasonable trend is not only detrimental to the banks themselves but also harmful to the entire economy. Given that the post-war economy urgently needs reconstruction, such a situation cannot be allowed to continue. However, improvement is not easy. The aforementioned causes are so complex that it is no wonder passive measures have been ineffective.</p>
<p>To improve the current situation, break out of the predicament, and expand business operations to fully exert regulatory effectiveness, we believe that the first step is to enhance financial strength, and the second is to assist in opening up new avenues for capital investment. Both of these points address the aforementioned abnormal state and are indispensable. Without enhancing financial strength, it is impossible to regulate industrial finance. If financial strength is actively enhanced but there are no new investment avenues, the distress of financial capital lacking legitimate outlets will reappear. Therefore, no single measure alone can save the banking industry from crisis or contribute to economic development.</p>
<p>(1) Methods to Enhance the Financial Strength of the Banking Industry</p>
<p>Enhancing financial strength is a prerequisite for business operations. The financial strength of banks can be divided into two categories: capital stock and deposits. In this era of advanced credit, although deposits have become the primary source of bank funds, capital stock remains the foundation of bank credit. According to the experience of various countries, increases in deposits are directly proportional to the strength of capital. Strong capital leads to solid credit, which enhances the ability to attract deposits. Therefore, the banks with the largest deposits are also those with the most substantial capital. In recent years, to adapt to the development of credit, banks in various countries have actively increased capital. Small banks have found it difficult to compete and are gradually being eliminated. Consequently, the lack of continued bank concentration has become a major problem. Therefore, to rescue the current financial crisis, increasing capital stock is paramount. Moreover, Chinese commercial banks must also engage in industrial credit, making it even more necessary to actively increase capital. In the past, restrictions on capital amounts led to the proliferation of small banks. When speculative booms occurred, they flourished. Such development is extremely dangerous, and this trend must be corrected in the future. Although the draft amendment to the Banking Law has raised the minimum capital requirement, it is still too low in the context of industrialization and cannot effectively prevent the trend of capital dispersion. Whether from an economic or banking standpoint, there is a need for further increases in capital stock. It is better to eliminate some small banks to consolidate the financial foundation. When necessary, we must also promote mergers to align with the global trend of financial concentration. To promote mergers, we should not restrict banks from being shareholders in other banks, and we should encourage large banks to participate in the capital of small banks. Given that small banks have low capital, they are easily manipulated by large banks. Holding more than one-third of the shares would allow mergers to proceed. In the past, many have advocated for mergers, but they have also recognized the numerous difficulties and deemed it unsuitable for China. However, the question lies in how to successfully acquire shares in small banks, which is worthy of in-depth research. China's banks have numerous factions, and their operating methods are not entirely the same. Furthermore, shareholders are unwilling to rashly relinquish their shares to others, fearing the loss of control. This is the greatest obstacle to mergers. However, we can leverage financial and creditor pressure to force restructuring, allowing large banks to participate in shareholding. Alternatively, we can force struggling institutions to liquidate and allow large banks to acquire them. These methods have numerous precedents in various countries and have proven highly effective, and China should emulate them.</p>
<p>If capital can be actively increased and concentrated, the ability to attract deposits will also be enhanced. The current sharp decline in deposits is only a temporary phenomenon. If the economy can stabilize, social capital will return to the banking industry. Although the pre-war situation was better than the present, it was still not ideal. Deposit amounts were very small, insufficient to bear the responsibility of regulating industrial credit. However, industrial scale was small, and the required capital was not substantial, so it could still be managed. In the future, with industrialization and expanded scale, the demand for capital will increase sharply. To effectively regulate, banks must have more capital. Therefore, it is necessary to actively promote savings policies to concentrate social capital, enhance available fixed capital, and expand credit to increase demand deposits and replenish working capital. The past deposit policy needs to be revised. More importantly, to avoid capital waste and expand operational capabilities, we must quickly establish close relationships between the central bank and commercial banks. Improvements to the deposit reserve system and the use of rediscounting and open market policies will allow banks to minimize their cash reserves and interbank deposits. With the central bank providing assistance, the banking industry will dare to engage in large-scale industrial credit with slower turnover.</p>
<p>While the deposit policy needs to be improved in normal times, what about the current situation? We are still in an extraordinary state, and the economy continues to fluctuate. There is no hope for a quick return of social capital to the financial industry. Can this situation be allowed to continue? Should we not seek rapid improvement? Even if the banking industry's current 200 billion in deposits could be safely used, it would still be insufficient to meet the needs of all industries. If the deposit situation continues to deteriorate, banks will ultimately find it difficult to abandon the pursuit of high-profit businesses. To rescue industry and the banking industry itself from crisis, we must quickly seek to enhance deposit capital. Although social capital is still fluctuating, and because of the narrowing avenues for speculation and the dangers of usury, some capital is considering stability. Timely absorption is a good opportunity. The way to absorb is to increase deposit interest rates. Would raising deposit interest rates not increase costs and exacerbate difficulties? While this is true, raising deposit interest rates can attract more deposits. Increased deposits can expand business and increase profits. Separating deposit and loan interest rates was originally a last resort. Currently, deposit interest rates are too low to arouse the interest of depositors. As a result, social capital risks private lending or is deposited in underground banks in pursuit of high profits. If bank deposit interest rates can be appropriately raised, even if they are not half as high as underground rates, people, for the sake of principal and interest safety, will be willing to deposit in banks. This refers to fixed deposits. As for demand deposits, which have frequent turnover, raising interest rates would only increase the burden and be of no benefit to the bank. Furthermore, demand depositors seek convenience of payment rather than high interest rates. Therefore, high interest rates cannot increase deposit amounts. To increase demand deposits, we must rely on the development of the credit system. Therefore, raising interest rates should be limited to fixed deposits, and demand deposits do not require it. Although this will increase the cost of bank funds, the increase in fixed deposits will improve the current state of bank capital and help consolidate the foundation of the banking industry.</p>
<p>(2) Opening New Avenues for Investment in Industry</p>
<p>After enhancing financial strength, it is necessary to guide the opening of new investment avenues. Otherwise, as in the past, the distress of lacking legitimate outlets will reappear, which will be detrimental to the entire economy and the banks themselves.</p>
<p>Before the war, although various banks gradually made efforts to engage in industrial credit, industrial loans still accounted for only about 10% of total loans. The difficulty of expanding the business of regulating industrial credit can be imagined. Currently, bank lending operations are restricted by the deposit situation. The amount has decreased sharply, and the content has also changed. Term loans account for less than 2%. This small amount cannot meet the needs of industrial credit. As a result, the industry has had to request financial assistance from national banks.</p>
<p>Recognizing that the banking industry does not value industrial lending and that industry urgently needs capital, the authorities stipulated in the regulations for managing banks the minimum amount of lending to industrial and mining enterprises, but also imposed the restriction that they cannot invest in industry as shareholders. Such regulations are contradictory. Without becoming shareholders, how can they be encouraged to invest in industry? Providing only short-term credit and not supplying long-term capital does not help industrial construction. The management regulations based on the extraordinary state may still be acceptable, but the draft amendment to the Banking Law based on the normal state should no longer adopt this attitude. Given that China's financial sector and industry have traditionally been disconnected, we should not add more restrictions if we want to connect them. Therefore, the implementation of the management regulations has been merely symbolic, with no practical benefit. To make bank funds available for production enterprises, we must guide and encourage them and provide investment convenience.</p>
<p>German banks adopt a universal banking system. We can emulate its examples and have a rational division of bank fund use. This can serve as an important reference for the amendment of our Banking Law. Short-term funds regulate commercial credit, and fixed funds regulate industrial credit. This way, long-term and short-term funds can each find their place, without any difficulties. This is much more rational than forcing the use of 50% or 30% of total deposits. Moreover, using short-term funds for industrial credit is extremely dangerous and harms the foundation of banks. It is not overly difficult for Chinese industries to borrow short-term funds, but it is extremely difficult to raise initial capital. Therefore, we should not restrict the assistance of the banking industry. The Banking Law should further encourage banks to participate as promoters of industry and in the underwriting of stocks. Banks adding shareholders can guide operations, and with guaranteed profits, they will dare to invest heavily. Underwriting stocks can generate huge profits as industry prospers. This is the only way to enhance the banking industry's interest in investing in industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the failure to clearly delineate the business of state-owned and commercial banks not only fails to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation but also creates a situation where the government and the private sector compete for profits. That is, instead of assisting commercial banks in their operations, the adjustment of industrial funds is supplied by state-owned banks. This is also a major reason hindering the expansion of banking business. It is no longer reasonable to rely on issuing currency to supply industrial funds. Coupled with the poor supply methods, this is not the phenomenon that a smooth industrial finance system should have. National banks should quickly specialize and become the central institutions for all types of credit, avoiding direct lending to avoid competition with commercial banks. They should also provide maximum financing and support, which will stimulate the expansion of banking business.</p>
<p>The above two methods must be implemented simultaneously to fully exert their respective roles. These two points are also the two key points of this amendment to the Banking Law, and the authorities also intend to concentrate financial power and adopt a universal banking system. However, there are too many overly cautious restrictive clauses, and the original intention of the amendment may not be realized. The banking industry will inevitably remain confused and find it difficult to comply, which will affect the establishment of a rational banking system. Therefore, this point still needs to be discussed and revised to suit the national conditions and give the banking industry a new dynamism.</p>

<h3>British Industry in Recovery</h3>
<p>— Xueyan</p>
<p>People outside of Britain all know that Britain is one of the world's three great powers today. Amidst the opposition between the US and the Soviet Union, Britain is in the middle, playing a balancing role. This is truly one aspect of Britain's diplomacy, which is relatively flamboyant and captivating. However, the status of a great power cannot be attained by simply standing in line or by gracefully yielding in international conferences or by playing a silent role like a "Mr. Guo" in the Security Council of the United Nations. It requires real strength as a backing and support. It is undeniable that Britain suffered considerable economic losses in this war. Overseas investments were almost completely sold or mortgaged, and the people's lives are also very difficult. Therefore, the most pressing post-war problems are increasing national wealth and improving the people's lives. Those inside Britain today are most concerned with these two matters. The entire nation is focusing its efforts on these two matters.</p>
<p>After more than a year of effort, Lord President of the Council Morrison, who is responsible for overseeing the nation's economic construction, yesterday specially hosted a press conference to report and review the state of Britain's production recovery. He was able to say with great pride, "A country that was on the verge of bankruptcy a year ago has today caught up with or surpassed many countries on the industrial front." He was not just boasting, as there are concrete facts to support his statement. This year, the production volume of British industry has not been lower in any month than the production volume of April 1935. As for exports, considering only the first three quarters, they have increased by at least 10% compared to the same period in 1939. Being able to both recover and expand production simultaneously and achieve such results is unparalleled in the world. No wonder Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, after returning from the United Nations Bank Conference in the United States, said in his first speech, "The speed and smoothness with which British production has recovered from wartime to peacetime has won the praise of the entire world."</p>
<p>Returning from the Military to Industry</p>
<p>Britain's construction work over the past year can be divided into three aspects: (1) Soldier demobilization, rapidly transforming the military into a productive workforce. The best way to illustrate the achievements in this area is with numbers. According to the Ministry of Defence, from the time Japan surrendered until August of this year, a total of seven million British soldiers were demobilized. These seven million people have been transported back to Britain from all over the world and integrated into various production departments, engaging in work. According to a report published by the Ministry of Labour on the 17th of this month, there are currently over 20.01 million people engaged in production work, an increase of approximately 400,000 people compared to the 19.7 million in mid-1939. Among them, the number employed by factories at the end of August this year was over 4.88 million, an increase of about 200,000 compared to the 4.68 million in the same period in 1939. From these comparative figures, it is clear that the utilization of labor in Britain has not only returned to pre-war levels but has also improved compared to pre-war levels.</p>
<p>(2) Industrial recovery, which involves restoring factories that were shut down or converted during the war to produce peacetime goods and increasing the production of certain particularly needed items. Achievements in this area are more difficult to describe and cannot be fully expressed by simple numbers. This is because firstly, there is the issue of raw materials. Britain itself does not produce raw materials, and the raw material production areas that Britain relied on before the war have yet to recover after being affected by the war, thus affecting production. The most obvious example is China itself. Before the war, Britain imported some raw materials from China, but currently, China simply cannot export. Even if there are available goods, the prices are too high to consider. Secondly, there is the issue of transportation. Whether it is importing raw materials or exporting finished products, all are subject to limitations in transport capacity, which naturally also affects production.</p>
<p>Control and Planning</p>
<p>(3) Control issues. If various industries are allowed to recover and develop freely, it will inevitably create an abnormal state. The most profitable products will expand the fastest, leading to competition for workers and raw materials, while the industries that are truly needed by society will be squeezed to the back and unable to recover. As a result, social chaos, rising prices, and economic bankruptcy will inevitably occur. Therefore, Britain is adopting a control policy. The order and magnitude of industrial recovery must be based on priority levels before raw materials can be purchased and workers can be hired. Therefore, industrial recovery is not simply restoring the pre-war state but making reasonable improvements based on pre-war experience.</p>
<p>The final point relates to a policy: promoting socialism. Equality in living standards is a major factor in contemporary political discourse. The wealth disparity in Britain is not as stark as in the United States, nor is it as distorted as in China, where millions of people are starving and countless people are living in misery with insufficient clothing and food, while at the same time, some people are profiting from the national crisis, the victory, and corruption, desperately stuffing gold and American dollars into the vaults of foreign banks. But no matter what, Britain also has a large wealth gap, and this gap has become more acute due to the war. The reason why the Labour Party was able to win and govern is that its policies gradually narrowed this gap between the rich and poor, changing the way social wealth and enjoyment are distributed. Therefore, the mission after taking power is to realize this policy. The concrete manifestation of this is various nationalization policies. The largest of these, such as coal mines, the Bank of England, fuel, and energy, have already begun nationalization. In addition, industries such as railways and telecommunications will also be implemented soon. Other goals, such as the socialization of medical care, the implementation of social insurance systems, the design of a 40-hour work week, and the popularization of higher education, are all aimed at improving the enjoyment of the majority of people. The Labour Party government's achievements over the past year have also been considerable, and the people's trust in them is noteworthy. Since taking office in August last year, the Labour Party has won 19 out of 19 by-elections for vacant parliamentary seats and has never lost a seat. According to Dalton, a government that can still win every election a year after taking office is the first since 1874.</p>
<p>Labour Party's Outstanding Achievements</p>
<p>It would be difficult enough to do just one of these three major tasks well, but the Labour Party government has been able to advance them simultaneously, demonstrating exceptional abilities. We have long known that Britain's exports are gradually returning to pre-war levels, and some products have even exceeded them. Yesterday, Morrison further detailed several production figures at the press conference, proving this point. The main ones are steel, which increased by 18% in August compared to the same period in 1935 and by 13% compared to the same period in 1938. Aluminum had a monthly production of 1,250 tons in 1935, while this year's monthly production has increased by an average of one time. Machine Tools increased by 50% compared to 1935. Light bulbs had an annual production of 100 million in 1935, and this year they can produce 180 million. Alarm clocks and other items were not produced in Britain before the war, but they are now being manufactured in large quantities.</p>
<p>People's Lives Still Not as Ideal</p>
<p>Although production is increasing, the most important phenomenon in British life today is still the lack of goods. What is the reason for this? According to official reports, the following factors combine to explain this:</p>
<p>(1) During the war, many daily necessities were only destroyed or damaged, lacking repair and replenishment. The work that has accumulated over several years now needs to be urgently repaired and rebuilt due to the cessation of war. Therefore, many materials and manpower are being diverted to this area. The most obvious examples are the housing problem and the public utilities problem. Currently, the number of workers engaged in construction alone has reached over 1.2 million, and the demand for other building materials is equally large, which naturally affects other products.</p>
<p>(2) Increased demand. According to Morrison, Britain's steel production has now exceeded pre-war levels by 10%, but the demand is far greater than this number. Aluminum production has doubled compared to pre-war levels, but the demand has increased by two times, so it is still insufficient. He also said that the phenomenon of feeling a shortage of goods due to increased demand is healthy. This development has no end, and society progresses by wanting to satisfy this demand. The pre-war phenomenon of overproduction and weak purchasing power was a morbid state. Now that social purchasing power is strong, the production sector should meet this demand. Morrison also said that after the government's efforts to improve the distribution of purchasing power, demand has also increased. For example, the current production of milk, beer, cigarettes, steelware, and electricity in Britain is far greater than before the war, but because the government has worked hard to improve the distribution of people's purchasing power, everyone has the power to enjoy them, and currently they feel insufficient. Therefore, the government's efforts to implement socialism and improve the general purchasing power of the people are also one of the reasons for the current shortage of goods.</p>
<p>Encourage Export Businesses, Domestic Needs Secondary</p>
<p>(3) Manufacturing export goods. Because Britain wants to increase overseas assets, it gives the highest priority in production to manufacturers of export goods. Recently, the Overseas Trade Department held an "Exhibition of Goods Made in Britain but Not Available Domestically," which caused a sensation across the country. To visit it, one had to queue for more than two hours before having the opportunity to enter, which shows how much attention it received. Over 5,000 types of goods were displayed in the middle, all of which were high-quality, finely made products that have already been sold overseas but are temporarily not allowed to be sold domestically. This effort to compete for overseas markets is naturally also a major reason for the shortage of goods.</p>
<p>(4) Contrary to encouraging exports is the strict restriction on imports. Britain has many goods that it relied on overseas imports before the war, such as food and some cosmetics. Food is unavoidable, but it has been reduced to a minimum. Overseas imports of cosmetics have simply disappeared. What people in Britain currently feel most insufficient is imported goods. But because of the rapid increase in exports, it is hoped that this will improve in the future. In fact, life in Britain today is better than it was a year ago.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Two Major Issues</p>
<p>Increasing production and promoting socialism are the most important issues within Britain today. A large portion of the government departments are related to these two matters. However, the Lord President of the Council Morrison is responsible for overseeing and planning these matters. He is the chairman of the Economic Planning Committee. He is one of the most organized, capable, and determined people in the Labour Party. In July of this year, Prime Minister Attlee originally had plans to visit Australia. During Attlee's stay in Australia, the position of Prime Minister was scheduled to be filled by Morrison. The government's announcement had also been made. Later, Attlee cancelled his trip to Australia due to certain matters, so the acting position was no longer needed. The removal of former Minister of Food Smith was rumored to be due to Morrison's dissatisfaction with his work. From these two matters, it can be seen how high Morrison's position is in the government today and how important he is in charge of the nation's production.</p>
<h3>The Influence of Erroneous Psychology</h3>
<p>— Author: Wen</p>
<p>The slogan of the "Love Domestic Products Movement", "Using domestic products is the most honorable," is aimed at the common perception that using foreign goods is glorious. Mr. Hu Boxiang, the initiator of this movement, once gave an example: he said that a friend's house displayed many cosmetics, and he was proud of them, thinking they were foreign goods, but in the eyes of an expert, they were not foreign goods at all, but simply used English trademarks and labels.</p>
<p>In fact, this kind of erroneous psychology greatly affects Chinese industry. Due to the prevalence of this psychology, many people have suffered. We may as well give a few examples to illustrate:</p>
<p>First, because Chinese people have the mentality that using foreign goods is glorious, many self-proclaimed clever businessmen ordered many medicines, shawls, raincoats, foods, etc. from foreign countries, but as a result, nine out of ten people lost money, and a large amount of Chinese gold bars flowed abroad. No one benefited, and Chinese industry was the first to be hit. The Chinese market became even more chaotic.</p>
<p>Second, because Chinese people have the mentality that using foreign goods is glorious, speculative merchants imitate foreign goods and attach foreign trademarks. As a result, users are always deceived. In recent times, because flannel was popular for a while, so-called Australian flannel appeared on the market. In fact, it was made in Shanghai using short wool. The quality was inferior, and it broke easily when pulled. In the end, those with erroneous psychology suffered losses themselves.</p>
<p>Third, because people generally think that foreign medicines must be better, the business of Chinese pharmaceutical factories has been greatly affected. In the October issue of "Reader's Digest," there is an article "Quarantine For Dr. Quack" which says that many American pharmaceutical merchants produce substandard products that cannot be sold in the American market, so they export them abroad. This can serve as a warning to those who think that as long as something comes from abroad, it must be excellent and refined.</p>
<p>For the sake of the future of the country's industry, correcting this erroneous psychology can be said to be the most urgent task.</p>
<h3>An Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Employee Psychology</p>
<p>(6) Creativity</p>
<p>Creativity is very important when doing any work, because with creativity, work can be improved. This can bring considerable benefits to business organizations, and also provide opportunities for promotion to employees.</p>
<p>Testing method: Regarding this testing method, foreign countries use more than a dozen photos that are known to the general public (such as the Bund in Shanghai, the West Lake in Hangzhou, or famous people, etc.). Below, the descriptions of each photo are annotated in a disorganized way, and then he is asked to correct them. This testing method can also show whether the person being tested can see the mistakes. A person without creativity will not observe ordinary things carefully.</p>
<p>(7) Thoroughness in doing things</p>
<p>This is related to patience and perseverance. A person without patience and perseverance can never do things very thoroughly.</p>
<p>Testing method: You can ask the person being tested to remove the number nine from the following numbers, then remove the number eight, then remove the number seven, and so on down to two.</p>
<p>457321485113478326528593764254931245845318</p>
<p>Each time a number is removed, the numbers that have not been removed can be written down. Write once for each removal.</p>
<p>(8) Agility</p>
<p>Agility in doing things can promote work efficiency. A person with a clear mind should have no problem with this test.</p>
<p>Testing method: You can use the method of filling in sentences, filling them in within a specified time to see if their minds are agile. These fill-in-the-blank questions are easy to formulate, such as:</p>
<p>A. Today - go to the town with me. B. The most important thing a person needs is --.</p>
<p>(9) Management talent</p>
<p>The testing of management talent is more commonly used when hiring senior employees, because junior employees do not urgently need to possess this talent.</p>
<p>Regarding the testing of management talent, you can adopt the methods used in various tests from the ten tests, and add more questions.</p>
<p>(10) Memory</p>
<p>Memory is very important in doing things. A person with a strong memory is also greatly benefited himself, because he can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Testing method: You can use numbers that are very similar to each other and ask the person being tested to look at them once, and then write them down silently to see if there are any mistakes. The following numbers are very similar, and people without a strong memory may not be able to do it.</p>
<p>7789 7878 34576 348576</p>
<p>During the test, you can adopt the nature of an exam, write all kinds of questions together, and ask employees to answer them in writing. If you want to ask questions orally, then number the questions and fill in the results after the oral test.</p>
<p>Regarding physical examination, it can be conducted by a doctor in charge, using a common health examination form.</p>

<h3>Diary of Deji</h3>
<p>— Dai Wangshu</p>
<p>For days, for weeks, for months, I stopped paying attention to myself and did not take care of myself. This is going through a tunnel. After passing through it, one can hope to see a new land... I am often afraid that an overly continuous consciousness will too rationally turn our future into the past and hinder the future. Only night and sleep allow transformation; if there is no oblivion in the chrysalis, the caterpillar will not turn into a butterfly when it wakes up.</p>
<p>This is what has become popular with Palice. His need to constantly look for a lesson, a "homework"—I find it unbearable. This is the mire of spiritual depravity. Those great works only educate us when they immerse us in an almost loving paralysis. I compare those who seek benefits everywhere to prostitutes who ask people "How much will you give me?" before selling their bodies.</p>
<p>When fish die, their bellies face up and float to the surface: this is their way of dying.</p>
<p>When I see some books, I always think: Who will read them? - When I see some people: What books will they read?... Afterwards, this is linked together.</p>
<p>While people are not paying attention, the leaves of the chestnut tree open. Every year, it is the same accident, the same annoyance of being surprised. Spring comes with light footsteps, like Santa Claus for children. Each time, I try again to serve more vigilantly, watching for its arrival; but there is still something mysterious and elusive. I stop thinking about it for a while; my eyes close or turn to read a book... I look up: it is already there.</p>
<p>(Undoubtedly, that is because the greatest effort of plant growth is carried out at night. See also the observations and opinions of Sandan's "Tropical Nature".)</p>
<p>The question of style. People sin due to ignorance, negligence, or boldness. Some writers never receive any blame, but that does not make them the best writers. Few people use grammar correctly and at the same time appear special. But all deliberation is detestable, and the activity of emotions and thoughts does not require it. Few readers can immediately understand the formality of this requirement; most readers only see affectation there. People with ordinary thoughts do not feel the need to express their thoughts in an extraordinary way. However, it is most detestable for a writer to only be bold with the pen.</p>
<p>For me, the loss of the initial importance of these style issues has not been very long. Their loss of initial importance is not that I think they are not very important; but that in my heart, other issues have grown up, have now reached adulthood, have caught up, and have dragged the rest behind. Let it be so.</p>
<h3>From Sexual Psychology - Talking about Havelock Ellis</h3>
<p>— Lao Dan</p>
<p>This morning, I happened to see my friend Wei Jun holding a copy of "Sexual Psychology", and I couldn't help but think of the author, Havelock Ellis. So I collected some materials and talked about this Hermes who dominates human thought. Havelock Ellis.</p>
<p>When Havelock Ellis is mentioned, some people always think of the issue of "sex". Naturally, "Sexual Psychology" is his immortal masterpiece, a groundbreaking work in publishing history. It threw a big bomb into the traditional ideological atmosphere of England, causing a very hot commotion in all directions. He was therefore arrested and taken to the government office. As a result, he was convicted of "intending to undermine the morals of the people." This book was also listed as a banned book, and was not allowed to be copied, disseminated, or read. It remained banned for decades, until German and American English versions were published successively, before England was unbanned.</p>
<p>In fact, Havelock Ellis's works are not just "Sexual Psychology". His writing life began with "The New Spirit", which advocated the theory of mental independence. The important principles of sex had already been indicated in it. "The Criminal" uses the perspective of a sexual psychologist to estimate the causes of crime, and is highly praised by Italian criminologists. "Man and Woman" is the prelude to "Sexual Psychology". Although it is not as detailed as "Sexual Psychology", it is also very insightful in the study of sexual psychology. Later, there were also "Affirmations", "The Nineteenth Century", "A Study of British Genius", "The Soul of Spain", "Impressions and Comments", "Love and Jeanne d'Arc Sketches", "The Problem of Today", "From Rousseau to Proust", etc. Speaking of his "From Rousseau to Proust", it reminds people of his "Confessions", published in 1934. He died in the summer of 1939. Then the publication of "Confessions" seems to be a publication after he was seventy-five years old. He made a final self-criticism and confession of his life.</p>
<p>During the First European War, he published "Essays in War-Time" and "The Philosophy of Conflict", which shows that he stood in the position of an artist and contributed to the country and academics, and never stood idly by.</p>
<p>Some people put Havelock Ellis and the author of the Chinese "Shuangmei Yinge Series" in the same category. In this way, their understanding of Havelock Ellis is not only too isolated, but also does not understand the scientific study of sexual psychology. Including all his philosophy, art and the essence of his thought, he also has a great work "The Dance of Life". It is a bit of an underestimation to regard him as the leader of sexual monism by people who are short-sighted.</p>
<p>Havelock Ellis was born in England in February 1859. In his childhood, he followed his parents on a cruise around the world. His academic qualifications changed from literature to medicine. After mastering medicine, he devoted himself to writing. Havelock Ellis and George Bernard Shaw were contemporaries in the same country, and were very good friends and humorists. When Shaw was young, he was down and out and frustrated for more than ten years, and he relied on Havelock Ellis's support to write for the Saturday Review, and Shaw gradually became famous. In his later years, Havelock Ellis wrote "Shaw's Biography", and died shortly after the manuscript was completed. Havelock Ellis handed the manuscript to Shaw in advance to be sorted and printed. There were many profound satirical remarks in the book, such as Wilde's words mocking Shaw, "He has no enemies in his life, and no very good friends." This is really a penetrating statement that completely reveals Shaw's character. Shaw did not change anything in Havelock Ellis's original manuscript except to correct some facts, but only added an "Afterword". In the "Afterword", he also relentlessly quoted Wilde's ridicule of Havelock Ellis in return, "Havelock Ellis has been invited to dinner at the homes of all the princes and nobles." It turned out that Havelock Ellis was unrestrained throughout his life. Whenever he went to a banquet, no matter who was present, he did not speak, which the British regarded as harmful to morals. If he was sitting with a deaconess of the Christian Church, he would indulge in talking about the physical curves of women, treating the church deaconess as a London dancer after the war. If the host knew his temper and separated him from romantic women, he would talk about the sublimity and greatness of Jesus' personality. Therefore, people only invited him "once" (they dared not invite him a second time), and that was the reason. Wilde's criticism can be said to be practical, mocking and abusive.</p>
<p>When Havelock Ellis was about to start writing, Shaw wrote a letter to Shaw, and Shaw panicked and wrote a letter to persuade Havelock Ellis not to write. Havelock Ellis refused. Shaw knew that he could not dissuade him, so he had to provide materials. When the entire manuscript was completed, Havelock Ellis published Shaw's original letter together, making Shaw both laugh and cry. It turned out that although Shaw was humorous, he was unusually cautious in dealing with people, and he was an extremely polite British gentleman. Havelock Ellis, on the other hand, was sometimes unrestrained. When he wrote "Wilde's Biography", he included a lot of descriptions of sexual desire. Even in his confessions, he vividly revealed the obscene experiences of his personal life. (Shaw's wife burned the book because the maid read it. Havelock Ellis despised Shaw's wife very much when he knew about this. Shaw's biography also contained many disrespectful words.) Try to ask, how could Shaw not be shocked when he first heard that Havelock Ellis was going to write a biography for him?</p>
<p>Havelock Ellis was a man of letters and also gifted. Although he was not a fan of Shaw, he was a close friend who knew Shaw well. Therefore, in his writing, he could ridicule and mock as he pleased, without any restraint, and without any need for politeness or taboos. Therefore, this book is particularly vivid. It makes people read it with relish, with humor, mockery, backbone, and deep thought. Every sentence is from the heart. It is a living biography that fully depicts Shaw's inner self and inner mind.</p>

<h3>Still Life</h3>
<h3>A Letter from Baghy</h3>
<p>— Ren Qi</p>
<p>The name of Julio Baghy, an Esperanto writer from Hungary, is not unfamiliar in China because Ba Jin translated one of his novels, "Spring in Autumn". During the First World War, he was captured by the Russian army. The Russian Revolution broke out again. He had to go through snowy and icy Siberia, where the Red and White Russians were fighting, and was sent back to his country. The impressions during this journey produced two novels, one is "The Sacrificed", which has been translated by Zhong Xianmin, and the other is Sur Sanga Tero "On the Blood-Stained Land", which seems to have not been translated by anyone. No news of him has been heard since the Second World War. Now I know a little news, that is a letter he wrote to the Swedish Esperanto Association at the beginning of this year. The following is the translation of this letter.</p>
<p>Budapest, January 2, 1946</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Immediately after the terror passed, and after my recovery from three months of blood poisoning, I sat down in front of my writing desk and, taking advantage of my freedom, wrote a forty-page (large format) booklet promoting our language [Translator's note: this refers to Esperanto, same below] and its significance in the coming new era. Naturally, this was written in Hungarian. Then I wrote a very detailed Esperanto grammar for my fellow countrymen. The first book has already been published, and the second book is being printed. In addition, I ran several workshops for those preparing to teach Esperanto and for new believers, and I gave lectures in various schools, factories, fire departments, and cities. I do not want to tell you what kind of personal situation I did all this in. Suffice it to mention that last year I did not eat my fill more than four or five times. Now the food situation is getting worse and worse, and the disaster of starvation is threatening. What to do? Many tens of thousands of people are in the same situation, especially those who, like me, have nothing to sell.</p>
<p>During the war, my home was robbed three times, and now I have almost no clothes to wear in winter. The windows in my house are broken, fuel only exists in theory, and essential food does not even exist in theory. I really don't know how I can get through the freezing season wearing a pair of old galoshes without shoes inside... The depreciation of our currency is already unbearably tragic. I can tell you this for you to imagine: my monthly salary (not the worst salary!) is only enough to buy one and a quarter kilograms of sugar or two liters of oil. If I want to buy clothes, at least six months' total salary is enough for one piece of clothing.</p>
<p>Now I have a paid position in the police of the democratic organization. To be more precise, I am the organizer and cultural worker of the Budapest Police Association. This association is a social education organization of the National Police Department. My work is really excellent, although it requires me to work hard day and night. An Esperanto department has just been established in this association to unite the police who speak Esperanto and educate new messengers. More than two hundred police officers have joined the training class, and this number is increasing every day. If the progress of international peace building is more favorable, this department must become one of the most important organizations of our movement [Esperanto movement - translator] in Hungary. I ask you, if possible, to publicize this new organization, send some books and magazines, write letters, and open up the correspondence of police colleagues who are interested in our cause. You cannot imagine their eagerness for foreign news, how they want to personally experience the various benefits of our language that I, from the side of the propagandist, am teaching them.</p>
<p>Please send the following announcement to the Swedish Esperanto newspaper</p>
<p>"Julio Baghy, Vice President of the Esperanto Academy, sincerely greets his Swedish friends and wishes them a happy new year. He is very willing to receive their letters, and after the postal relations improve, he will try his best to reply. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to reply immediately now. Address: Budapest, Rottenbiller u. 66 Hungarlando."</p>
<p>The Hungarian Esperanto Workers' Association, which was eliminated in 1933, has been re-established and has begun lively propaganda. Unfortunately, members are busy fighting for a small piece of bread every day, so the whole movement is still stagnant, but... but we have not lost hope. When we meet each other, there is a greeting ESPERON [hope]! This greeting is gradually becoming popular. In addition, I ask you to convey the greetings of my comrades to your members.</p>
<p>Waiting for your reply, I greet you again!</p>
<p>Your friend Julio Baghy</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 103</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Victory Drink". She smiled enchantingly. (Since the Japanese launched military operations against China, many food and beverage products have been renamed with new names, with the meaning of auspicious omens; not to mention that Tsurumi heard it and felt baffled; even the waiters in those shops, tea houses, and restaurants were confused.)</p>
<p>From Tsurumi's point of view, this kind of situation is called "cage door" by the people of Shanghai; it is called "caught the shrimp" or "caught the guys" in the local dialect of Beiping, and the word "stiff" is often used in writing. Please think, what does this situation count as? Communication? Or confrontation? Or a "passing door" of the same line? The first step, it is not easy to determine the attitude of these three natures. If the nature and attitude cannot be determined, and the enemy is mistaken for a friend, or one's own people are regarded as outsiders, one's bottom line will be seen through as soon as one speaks. If one ignores friend or foe, and only takes out the topic of communication to deal with it, it is certainly possible, but that is only if it is expected that the other party is mostly on the side of a friend. Otherwise, according to the rules, one should first show some color to the enemy and give a deterrent. Otherwise, people will think that you are showing weakness; at least they will say that you are "cowardly."</p>
<p>Tsurumi took out his helpless housekeeping skills in this "stiff" situation - "flushing". The scientific term for this "flushing" method is "ionization." It is like a domestic dog seeing a stray dog ​​that does not look pleasing approaching. Before the emotion has been determined to be good or bad, it must first circle the approaching dog's body, and then aim at the stray dog's nose and sniff. This is the dog's usual way. As for people, that certainly cannot be done this way.</p>
<p>Isn't Tsurumi smoking a cigarette? That's right. With a courteous hand, in a grand and artistic way, he took out a delicate cigarette case from the pocket of his tuxedo waistcoat, opened the cigarette case in a very elegant manner, and handed it over politely.</p>
<p>The Chinese Triads, Good Old Society, Robe Brothers Society, and other Jianghu friends, all have ways of drinking tea and smoking cigarettes. Inside and outside the threshold, it can be distinguished only by the gesture of taking the tea bowl and taking the cigarette. Tsurumi could not use this set of methods; there are many reasons, the simplest one: before he has determined which group the other party is a member of, he cannot first reveal his own whereabouts; because the other party is also an expert.</p>
<p>"Thank you." She took one with a smile, and lit the cigarette with the fire handed over by Tsurumi's quick gesture. "Thank you", then smiled slightly again, immediately followed by a slight wrinkle of her painted eyebrows, completing a frown after the smile. After this frown, she slightly raised her carefully made-up eyelids and glanced at Tsurumi charmingly. This glance was full of emotions of resentment:</p>
<p>"Mr. Tsurumi," she asked softly, restoring her natural smile, "Don't you really feel my rudeness?"</p>
<p>At this time, the so-called "Victory Drink" was brought up just right. What exactly is it? It turned out to be a large glass of amber-colored liquid, not very transparent. The Chinese way of saying it in English is "Orange Squash", and the literal translation found in the Anglo-Chinese Dictionary by the Europeanized faction is "orange crushed liquid."</p>

<h3>The Sea of People</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Despite the progress of aviation, which has shortened the distance between the world, there are still various "walls" between people, making it impossible for everyone to get close and touch.</p>
<p>Taking Shanghai, which has a population of four million, for example, perhaps only an atomic bomb is needed to wipe it all out, but among these four million people, countless stories of tragedy are being produced.</p>
<p>You are walking on the road, just turning your head to look at a cashmere sweater in the shop window, and in that second, your long-awaited friend, whom you have been separated from for ten years, walks past you, missing you. This is one example.</p>
<p>Secondly, your past lover or girlfriend happens to meet you in the same hotel, but unfortunately, either her husband is next to her, or your wife is with you, so you can only look at each other in your heart. This is also an example.</p>
<p>The masses of living beings, the vast sea of people, encounters almost become a matter of heavenly descent rather than human pursuit. This often leads to legends, and people are dazzled by them and feel small.</p>

<h3>Where Did This Giant Python Come From? It Actually Repelled Tanks</h3>
<p>— Huang Jieqing</p>
<p>On the 23rd, this newspaper reported that a giant 800-year-old python had been discovered on the Burma Road, which swallowed soldiers and was not afraid of tanks.</p>
<p>In mythological stories, we often see thrilling tales of giant pythons and snakes. The unofficial history of the "Legend of the White Snake" is also told vividly. However, most of these are fictional and cannot be believed. Unexpectedly, a strange real-life myth has appeared in today's scientific age. Moreover, this giant python actually confronted the authoritative weapon of today, the tank, swallowing soldiers and unafraid of bullets. Later, the Americans ended the existence of this rare and strange python by dropping several giant bombs from bombers. These are truly astonishing times!</p>
<p>It is said that there were rumors about this giant python even before the War of Resistance, but during the war, it may have lived deep in the jungle and was not discovered. Now that the Burma Road is no longer a battlefield, it carelessly lies on the highway.</p>
<p>According to reports, this giant python is truly enormous and incredibly dangerous. What exactly happened remains to be reported by biologists. We believe that it may not be as astonishing as the telegrams report.</p>
<p>Here, let's talk about some things related to "Mr. Snake":</p>
<p>Originally, snakes like humid and warm environments, so the tropics are where the most snakes are found. According to a Japanese biologist named Heishichiro Yoshida, there are more than 2,600 species of snakes, about one-third of which are venomous.</p>
<p>The southwestern provinces of China, especially western Guangdong and Hainan Island, produce more snakes. The pythons on Hainan Island are often more than ten zhang in length, with a girth of seven or eight chi, and can swallow humans, jackals, tigers, leopards, and deer. The gallbladders of these pythons are about the size of duck eggs.</p>
<p>In 1934, a 30-foot-long scaled python was discovered on Trinidad Island off the coast of Venezuela in South America. The local natives called this giant python "Hurra," and it could swallow a shark whole.</p>
<p>On March 12, 1936, a large snake more than ten zhang long, as thick as a giant urn, and covered with red and black spots was discovered in Lianyungang, China. After being discovered by farmers, they beat drums and attacked it, and the snake escaped. The appearance of such a giant snake in the north is indeed rare.</p>
<p>However, the fearfulness of snakes does not lie in their large size but in their venom. The Bothrops insularis snake from South America is only 1.4 meters long, but it can kill a cow in 45 minutes. In Legge Copse, India, there are venomous snakes that are 3 meters long. If a human is bitten by it, they will die within two hours. If an elephant's trunk touches its venom, it will die in just three hours. There is a type of venomous snake in Xikang Province, China, that is only one or two cun long, with bright eyes and fast crawling. It occupies the top of the mountain and establishes nests everywhere. Although the mountain is rich in medicinal materials, no one dares to collect them.</p>
<p>Snakes also like to kill each other. Often, giant snakes swallow small snakes, but there are also small venomous snakes that can kill giant pythons.</p>
<p>Snake meat can be eaten, the gallbladder can be used to make medicine, and the skin can be used to make shoes and purses, etc. It can be said that every part of the snake can be used. However, before killing and eating it, the venomous teeth must be removed. Eating snake meat is a unique hobby of the Cantonese people.</p>
<h3>Those Who Obey Me Shall Live, Those Who Resist Me Shall Die</h3>
<p>— Wangu</p>
<p>The winds and rains, the rights and wrongs, the current situation is truly a thick fog. In the fog, there is much to be done: Some people who do not participate in the National Assembly themselves insist that those who do participate violate the will of the people, while those who act in accordance with Yan'an (that is, those who are beneficial to Yan'an) are following public opinion. Furthermore: Those who do not run with Yan'an are "betraying friends" and "changing their principles"; conversely, they are all "statesmen with dignified demeanor." A foreign reporter who came from the "Liberated Area" said it well: "Those who obey me shall live, those who resist me shall die!"</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, I think it would be best if China only had one party—a party that would "revolve" the proletariat's "fate"!</p>
<h3>Goering's Suicide Poison: Potassium Cyanide</h3>
<p>— Mai Ye</p>
<p>Goering, the number one Nazi war criminal and a lover of medals during his lifetime, finally committed suicide by taking poison in his cell in Nuremberg late on the night of October 15th, two hours and fifteen minutes before his scheduled execution by hanging. Not "a general dying on the battlefield," nor brave enough to walk up the thirteen short steps to the gallows, Goering cowardly took potassium cyanide in his cell. The small glass tube containing the poison was his last "medal"—this "medal" was rumored to be hidden in his belly!</p>
<p>"Potassium cyanide" is a highly poisonous substance. Not long ago, Japan's number one war criminal, Fumimaro Konoe, also committed suicide by swallowing potassium cyanide in the middle of the night, right? Not only that, but last fall, another high-ranking Nazi leader committed suicide in prison by secretly taking potassium cyanide. He had prepared it long ago: hiding the poison in a fake gold tooth. The jailers conducted body searches "repeatedly," but naturally could not find it. In the end, one day, he removed the gold shell, and once the poison took effect, his "soul returned to hell" (heaven has no place for him!), and he breathed his last!</p>
<p>Is it "fighting poison with poison"? Those poisoned by the poisonous Nazi ideology ended their lives with deadly poison!</p>
<p>In ordinary chemistry laboratories, potassium cyanide is considered one of the most poisonous substances. Some people call it "green arsenic." In fact, the "arsenic" (i.e., "arsenic stone") used by Pan Jinlian to poison Wu Dalang after being instigated by Mother Wang, as described in "Jin Ping Mei," is far less potent than potassium cyanide. A sensational love affair that took place in Guilin two or three years ago: the male protagonist, Mr. Li (a chemistry professor), had an affair with a female assistant in the chemical laboratory. Later, his wife died after angrily taking poison. The man argued in court that his wife died from accidentally eating poison herself, not that he poisoned her, the most powerful proof being that she died from eating barium chloride. If he had intended to kill her, he would have used the more poisonous potassium cyanide. Both of these drugs were available in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Potassium cyanide is a white crystalline powder that looks similar to Taiwan No. 1 white sugar. Smelling it with your nose doesn't seem to have any odor, but if you sniff it too much, you will become dizzy and poisoned. It is unknown whether it has any taste when tasted with the tongue. Some people say it has a strange smell, but by the time a person notices that the smell is wrong, their fate is already standing on the "Yinyang Bridge" on the "Naihe River" between the human and the ghost worlds! The danger of potassium cyanide can be proven by this example: Twelve years ago, when I was studying "forensic medicine" with an old professor in Tokyo, there was a shocking potassium cyanide case in Tokyo at that time. The perpetrator was the lover of a "tea girl" (i.e., waitress) in a certain tea shop. The victim was the said mistress. The man secretly put potassium cyanide in a cup of coffee and let the woman drink it. After she drank one or two sips, the cup had not even been put back on the saucer when she fell sideways and died. The remaining poisonous coffee spilled all over her body!</p>
<p>The chemical formula for potassium cyanide is KCN. It has a very strong affinity for many metals. It can dissolve gold bars and silver ingots, so it has great uses in "metallurgy." The copper plates or zinc plates published in the "Shen Bao" every day also cannot do without it when shooting negatives. Iron is the hardest of all metals, and steel is even harder than iron. The hardest Japanese "wind steel" cannot do without potassium cyanide as a hardening agent during steelmaking. A piece of iron, when heated red hot, only needs to be dipped in a potassium cyanide solution, and after cooling, it will be many times harder. Potassium cyanide also has many uses in agriculture and is considered indispensable in chemical analysis.</p>
<p>Potassium cyanide is so poisonous because it interacts with the iron in human blood. When blood encounters it, it immediately undergoes a terrible change. According to "forensic medicine," potassium cyanide poisoning is the easiest to detect. The skin of the deceased must be a beautiful golden yellow because the potassium cyanide combines with the blood. By the way, if there is a body of a potassium cyanide poisoning victim in a well, it is best to fill the well with mud and never use it again.</p>
<p>When, oh when, will the blood of the likes of Franco be tainted with a little potassium cyanide!</p>

<h3>The Most Luxurious Hotel in the World</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang</p>
<p>Some people say: As long as you have the patience to wait at the door of the Waldorf Hotel in New York, it is not difficult to see the great figures of the world.</p>
<p>Since the Waldorf Hotel was built, it has become the "New York Office" of American presidents. Roosevelt and Truman both stayed there. Hoover, the only living former president of the United States who came to China this year to conduct investigations, has also booked a long-term room here.</p>
<p>Emperors, queens, heads of state, prime ministers, diplomats, and business tycoons from all over the world... Those who pass through New York rarely stay in any other hotel besides the Waldorf. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, De Gaulle, King George V of Greece, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands... have all been guests at the Waldorf. Now that the United Nations is "established" in New York, the Waldorf has added countless footprints of "world safety makers." The recent meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers was also held here, and the Waldorf Hotel seems to be competing with the Luxembourg Palace.</p>
<p>The Duke of Windsor, who "gave up the throne for love," also stayed here when he visited the United States. At that time, he made a joke: Once, he got "lost" in the Waldorf Hotel. Finally, he found the entrance to the elevator and rang the bell to call the elevator. Who knew that this elevator was for carrying goods, but the Duke of Windsor nonchalantly stepped inside. The elevator operator felt quite at a loss. The naturally uninhibited Duke of Windsor was now sitting comfortably on the cargo box. He said to the driver: "Let's go. If you don't mind, I don't mind."</p>
<p>Behind the Waldorf's luxury and glory, human tragedies and comedies happen every day. Men and women dance, love, divorce, and die here. Last year, MGM produced a film called "Weekend at the Waldorf" using the Waldorf as a backdrop, depicting the various aspects of this place.</p>
<p>The room rates at the Waldorf, although not as expensive as some people might imagine, are not cheap either. Some specially ordered and beautifully decorated suites with two to ten rooms cost $120 US per day.</p>
<p>The Waldorf's kitchen is world-renowned and is known as a "small international alliance." Most of the chefs, butchers, seasoning chefs, and pastry chefs are hired from various countries. The head chef is Italian, and the baker is Australian. The porcelain and silverware are managed by Portuguese, Filipinos, and Spaniards respectively.</p>
<p>Lucius Boomer, the guiding spirit of the Waldorf, is recognized as the most outstanding hotel management authority in the world. He manages 10,000 employees without chaos or slackness.</p>
<h3>"Refund!"</h3>
<p>— Jiesheng</p>
<p>On the evening of the 11th, the fourth show of "Yingfei Renjian" was being performed at a certain large theater. Just as it was nearing the end, after Liu Ying was expelled by the teacher, Mr. Luther, the film suddenly went silent. The entire audience was in an uproar, but in less than a minute, it continued, and the film had sound again. The noisy audience then quieted down.</p>
<p>Although the "silent scene" lasted for only a minute, a psychological test was conducted during this time: After the film "went silent," those who wanted to shout first made strange noises, and then they shouted what they wanted to say, even—"Refund!" "Refund!" "Refund!"</p>
<p>Just before this silent scene, in the dialogue when Liu Ying was expelled by Mr. Luther, Liu Ying said this sentence: "They only have money in their eyes!" I don't know what kind of aftertaste the many audience members who shouted "Refund" will have when they think of this sentence again after shouting. I am not speaking for the theater owner, I just feel that these people like to "tease people for fun" too much, resulting in the complete disorder of public order! Accidents in public places are unavoidable, and this sudden incident is precisely a test of the public's spirit of maintaining order!</p>
<h3>Tit for Tat</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>Rubber Nails</p>
<p>A reckless and conceited playwright, when his own play was about to be staged, sent two tickets for the first night of the performance to the mayor. He attached a note saying that the mayor could invite a friend, saying in the letter: "If you happen to still have a friend, you can invite him."</p>
<p>The mayor returned the two tickets with a very humble letter, saying that he already had an appointment, so it was impossible to come to the theater on the first night of the performance, but he wanted to buy two tickets for the second night, "If that play can still be performed."</p>
<p>A Child's Thoughts</p>
<p>A mother taught her young son, saying: "We should help others when we live in the world." He considered this sentence for a long time, and then asked: "Then what do others live in the world for?"</p>
<p>Not Without Insight</p>
<p>During the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests, everyone was arguing about what weapons would be used in the next war—atomic bombs, microbes, or rockets.</p>
<p>"I don't know what weapons will be used in the next war," said a young army adjutant, "But in the war after the next war, for sure, they will have to go back to using stone spears from the Stone Age as weapons."</p>
<p>Giving as Good as One Gets</p>
<p>A fisherman who made a living by fishing was famous for being good at telling jokes. One day, a fat widow happened to pass by there, and shouted to him: "Hey, boatman, people tell me that you are a very famous 'liar' here."</p>
<p>The fisherman said humbly: "Madam, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life." (Editor's note: Please note: the word "beautiful" here comes from a "liar.") (Translated from the November Reader's Digest)</p>
<h3>Rose Wine and Overcoat</h3>
<p>— Jianhua</p>
<p>Shanghai Cross-Section</p>
<p>This extremely interesting scam unfolded like this:</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Chen lives in Xiangfen Lane, Tianjin Road, and is currently a teacher at a middle school on Liuhe Road. The two places are not far apart. Mr. Chen must go to school from Xizang Road every morning and return home the same way in the evening. He is familiar with the route and travels back and forth like this every day.</p>
<p>Last Friday, when Mr. Chen returned home after class, he saw that the newly made overcoat that was hanging in the bedroom was gone. He asked his wife, who was preparing dinner. Mr. Chen's wife said in surprise after her husband's inquiry: "That's strange! The overcoat was taken away by a school worker, who said that you were afraid of the cold in the evening and specially sent him to take it away; and he brought back two bottles of white rose wine, saying that you were inviting guests tomorrow and bought what you needed in advance. Look! Aren't those two bottles of white rose wine on the table?"</p>
<p>After hearing what his wife said, Mr. Chen knew that he had been deceived. He realized that this overcoat, which he had worn twice when it suddenly got cold at the beginning of the month, must have been noticed by the scammer on the road, who had followed and discovered his address, pretending to be a school worker to commit fraud. As for the white rose wine that was brought, it was to make the family believe that he was a school worker, serving as bait. The broad-minded Mr. Chen, thinking of this, couldn't help but laugh and said to his wife: "We must not disappoint the scammer's good intentions. Now that we have good wine, tomorrow please prepare some dishes and invite two or three close friends to our home for a small drink. Wouldn't that be fun?"</p>
<p>At six o'clock, Mr. Chen went to school and said to his colleagues: "I am honored to have been the victim of a theft, and I have prepared some wine. Please join me for a simple meal tonight. Please don't thank me." The colleagues were baffled and thought it was a joke until Mr. Chen told them about the scam, which aroused a lot of laughter.</p>
<p>After four o'clock, Mr. Chen forcibly pulled a few friends and went home together for a small drink. Mr. Chen's wife opened the door to welcome them and said: "Now that the scam has been exposed, did you bring back the overcoat?" This sudden question caught Mr. Chen off guard. Mr. Chen's wife said anxiously: "Around one o'clock this afternoon, a man in uniform came, claiming to have been sent by the ×× branch office, saying that the scammer had been caught, but he needed to take back the exhibit, the white rose wine, for strict investigation, so he handed over the wine to the person." Before Mr. Chen's wife finished speaking, the colleagues burst into laughter.</p>
<p>For the sake of an overcoat, there would be repeated scams, as if joking. Even the discerning and capable Mrs. Chen would be unable to see through the maze at the time and be deceived, which is truly a unique aspect of scams.</p>
