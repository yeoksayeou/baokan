<p>爭總主席互相毆打</p>
<p>該會籌備已久，實際負責籌備者為章乃器·李公機等，至九日晚在遷川大廈章乃器處商定，大會主席團人選為市農會代表劉野　。市總工會代表譚澤森，市商會代表周德侯，教育界代表吳人初·婦女界代表傳伯羣及各界代表　　航·郭德全·章乃器·古鋒·李公樸·張冕·李德全·李森普·史良·施復亮·黃次咸等，并邀請郭沫若·邵力子·周恩來·李燭塵·沈鈞　等參加。十日晨九時許，參加大會民衆即陸續到達，計勞動協會約四百人，育才學校約百餘人，新華日報百餘人，市農會·總工會·市商會各團體約二千餘人。九時半開會，主席團章乃器提議，由李德全為總主席，而周德侯則以擴大器當會場報吿謂：我國農民最多，提譏以農會代表劉野樵為總主席，台下鼔掌表示贊成，劉氏立即宣布開會，領導行禮如儀，在致開會詞時，李公樸以劉不應充任總主席，阻止劉氏發言，並奪去劉氏手中之播音器，一時台下　然，民衆紛紛擁上主席台，秩序大亂，亙相毆打，劉野樵·李公樸均頭部受傷，朱其瑞手部，施復亮腿部，郭沫若左額亦略受微傷。</p>
<p>憲兵警察維持秩序</p>
<p>是時憲警趕至排解，並保護沈鈞　。郭沫若等出塲，李公樸等就醫市民醫院，劉野樵亦因傷退席，山周德　代理主席，繼續開會，市民數人致詞後，通過宣言，高呼口號散會。會後劉野樵假百齡餐廳招待記者，報吿被毆情形，略謂：本市農工商各人民團體代表，昨晚被推定為主席團，今晨開會時，不料勞動協會曾員，育才學生參加毆打，致主席團李公樸及本人等均被毆傷，誠為不幸，過去滄白紀念堂迭被搗亂，證以今日之糾紛，即可知事實之眞相。並謂：市民黃建輝目覩秦虎。謝稚尚等被勞動協會會員逮捕，是誰蹂躪人權，亦可明暸云云</p>
<p>李公樸郭沫若輕傷</p>
<p>記者旋赴市民醫院探視李公樸，李氏頭部裏紮紗布，已步出醫院大門。是時，羅隆基·周恩來等一行，亦趕至醫院，見李氏出門，細等復挽李入院，記者就詢該院醫生石連生大夫，彼特簽證明書如下：「患者李公樸住院號（八一八四），江蘇籍，男性，四十六歲，查係患有頭皮裂傷一起，長約二公分，此蹬。」又據該院事務主任尹恭震稱：郭沫若·施復亮及勞動協會受傷者四人，亦曾到院檢查並透視，因受傷輕微，經診治後皆即離院。</p>
<p>李德全昨招待記者</p>
<p>下午三時，該會在中蘇文協舉行記者招待會，由李德全主持，首稱：陪都各界慶祝政治協商會議成功大會，經本市廿餘團體之籌備，支出費用四五十萬元，不圖今日在校場口開會時，竟遭暴徒搗亂，歐傷李公樸·郭沫若·施復亮諸先生，大會籌備委會曾推出章乃器先生為總主席，乃今日開會時，劉野樵自任主席。</p>
<p>章乃器等報告經過</p>

<p>〔本報長春十日電〕東北接收工作沉悶之現階段，吉林所屬之農安及九台兩縣，即將開始接收，農安縣長定十一日首途，九台縣長則定十二日離長。九台縣長喬樹芳，上月廿九日曾率領該縣接收人員及保安隊乘軍赴縣邑接收未遂，刻蘇方通知目前巳可接收。按九台為長士吉綫上要邑，在長春東北百廿里，其南營城子為長春煤源所在，以往為八路軍所佔，目前除九台縣城八路軍撤離外，營城子猶為八路軍所控制，畏春煤荒即由此使然。農安距長春稍遠於九台，在長春以北偏西。</p>

<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十日電〕蘇聯公民今日舉行八年來第一次投票，選舉最高蘇維埃會議代表，十八歲以上之公民均有投票權。莫斯科方面清晨六時起開始投票，氣溫雖在零點以下，但投票處人頭擁擠，直至午夜截止時，羣眾仍如蝟集。反對選舉共黨候選人，唯有交出空白票。一九三七年選舉時，全部票數一萬萬票中，僅有反對票六十三萬二千票。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科九日電〕蘇聯全國定十日舉行普選，選舉並不以蘇聯領土為限，海外軍民及公海商船上旅客均有投票機會。敵國境內蘇聯佔領軍獲有特權，即在每十萬選民中，選舉代表一人，否則為每三十萬人中，選舉一人。極北區域，西伯利亞及山嶺地區，設有特別投票區，火車上乘客如能證明其有投票權，亦可投票。</p>

<p>我國在美政府協助下，樂已開始進行計劃着世界上最大的長江水利工程，詳情曾　載上月廿七日本報第三版。此次承中大教授胡先生由美遙寄本文，介紹TVA內容縈詳，亟為刋布，足供國人參考。按胡教授為國內有數的地理學專家，自去年十月奉派赴美考察以來，對地理學及地理教育，鑽研旣深，收穫尤豐，蓋均由實地落勘察中得來而値得向國內廣播者。（編者）</p>
<p>羅斯福手創　世辦樂園TVA</p>
<p>去年十二月底，美國地理學家聯合會，在南部田納西州諾克斯城開會，本人被邀參加，一方趁此機會，得和美國大部份地理學家見面，一方提出中國人口問題，來和美國專家討論，尤其難得的，是實地視察TVA，所謂區域設計，區域開發，TVA已成世界聞名的樂園。TVA的全文，譯成中文是「田納西河流域管理局」，這是美國前總統羅斯福在一九三三年設立的，是他推行新政開發地方重要設施之一，到現在不過十二年，已經成效大著，造福國家社會，所謂理想國，所謂烏托邦，在這裏確已變成現實的境地。</p>
<p>田納西河是密士失必河支流渥亥渥河的支流，全長一千公里，流經七州，流域面積十萬方公里，和我國的浙江省差不多大小，全區人口，至今不過四百五十萬，衹抵得浙江省人口的四分之一；流域四境多山，雨量也很多，全年約有一千三百公厘，因此不僅土壤容易被雨侵蝕，而且時常洪水泛濫，過去的地方經濟，因此十分貧瘠。</p>
<p>幹流九大閘　支流共造十三閘</p>
<p>現在的田河流域怎麼樣，幹流造了九個大閘，支流造了十三個閘，總計有二十二個閘。這些水閘，（一）是節制洪水，現在不僅田納西河不再洪水為患，密士失必河水災，因此也大為減輕。（二）是便利航運，幹流各閘，均設船閘，上下流水位雖不同，吃水九英尺的船隻，終年可以通行；田河上下游水位相差五百英尺，如無船閘設施，航行幾不可能。（三）是發電，這是TVA的中心工作，現在全區水閘，共有發電能力二百五十萬瓩，加上火力發電，共計達三百廿萬瓩。去年一年，共計發電卅二萬萬瓩小時，每一瓩小時，足抵一人十小時的工作，這裏全年電力，足抵一千萬人的工作效能。</p>
<p>原子彈工廠　TVA供應電力</p>
<p>這些電力，約有百分之六十，用於工廠，最重要的，係原子彈工廠，美國鋁廠，以及其他金屬工廠，都是美國戰時最重要的國防工業，也是這次大戰決勝的重要設施。此外，像肥料廠，是改良本區內外農業最重要的基礎，現在全區內外，約有六十萬戶電力用戶，這是鄉村電化的重要樞紐，平均電價，每度僅値一分餘，民間用電，均組合作社聯合營。</p>
<p>總計TVA成立以來，共用國庫七萬萬美金，其中約有百分之六十五，用之於發電設備。現在售電收入，每年有四千萬美金，除去開支二千萬，淨餘可二千萬，預計三十年內，可將全部創辦費悉數還清，而發電設備，依然存在，以上是介紹TVA的大槪情形。</p>
<p>根據上面所說，似乎TVA的精神，就是水閘、電力、經濟，實際決非如此。TVA是以一個公司的形態做事，不是一個衙門，但是TVA的工作，上起聯邦政府的各部，下與邦政府和鄉鎮公所，均有聯繫，均有合作，千頭萬緒，左右逢源，這真是美國民主精神的最高表現。</p>
<p>其次TVA的工作，不僅防供，不僅發電，不僅製肥。這兒有教育工作，有研究工作，有衛生工作，還有經營遊覽工作，五花八門，應有盡有。</p>
<p>TVA的行政，最高有董事三人，由美國總統任命，內部用人行政，一切可以自由，惟行政方針，則取決於國會，每年向國會報吿工作。他和其他機關的聯繫，都是根據契約關係，不受任何方面的牽制，也決不侵犯任何方面的職權。</p>
<p>美民主精神　TVA極度表現</p>
<p>由此看來，TVA不僅是一種工程技術，或者商業經濟的組織，同時是一個政治組織，社會機構，過去是一個地方開發的試騐所，目前已成為現實世界的極樂土。據說十年以來，世界各地來此參觀的，已在一千萬人以上。</p>
<p>我們中國，現在正要開始建設YVA，建設揚子江西陵峽水閘，論其規模，比TVA還偉大。我們的黃河，情形和過去的田納西河相仿，成災則尤甚於田納西河，我們的HVA，又將於何時開始組織呢？</p>
<p>我們效法TVA，不僅效法他的工程技術，水電經濟，而尤重要的，是學他們的辦事精神，合作精神。據說參觀TVA的，我國同胞特別多，我們希望TVA的成就和精神，能確切的實現於中國。我本人現在還在國外，但是對於我們的YVA，HVA乃至整個的中國，都寄予着無上的期望。中國的天時地利都很好，所缺乏的是人和，衹要人盡其力，自然地盡其利，TVA的經營，是我們最好的榜樣，希望我們大家來努力（向國內廣播稿）</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>貴報迭次登載關於披露蘇北實情的文章，總算在上海尚有這麼一家報紙，還未忘懷我們蘇北一隅的同胞，實使我們衷心感激。老實說，現在我們在上海，報紙上，雜誌上，所看到的，關於所謂「解放區」的紀載，都是一班不　事實閉起眼來做文章的文學家們的大作。尤其有一兩種雜誌上，他們常常把所謂「解放區」描寫得出神入化，說是在那裏已奠定了真正民主的基石，那裏的軍隊是真正人民的武力。我們見了這些宣傳式（作者當然說是事實）的文章，只有把氣望肚裏嚥。因為他們既在直接的讚美「解放區」，間接簡直就在為我們這班成千上萬從「解放區」中流亡出來的人是神經病，受餓受凍是他媽的活該。唉！這些文學家們，張開嘴巴來都是說替人民說話，引為已任，為什麼會做出這種矇蔽性的文字來呢？難道這就是言論自由的表現？所謂「解放區」的實情，我在此無庸多說。在上海，因與蘇北比較隔閡，同時生活又比別處高，流亡到此間的還是少數，不易見到流亡者的實情。不過我只希望這班文學家們，跑到鎮江揚州一帶去看看，那裏有無數的流亡者，老少男女俱全，他們躑躅街頭，住無定所，食無定處，同時亦得不到任何安慰。他們為什麼情願停留在這一個「毫無自由，毫不民主」的圈子裏受罪，而不願到那「發主自由」的「解放區」裏過安定的生活呢？我想在這班　摔場的文學家們看來，不識之曰「頑固」，亦必說他們是奉命而來破壞「解放區」令譽的「反民主的特務份子」了。盡至此，感憤萬端，不再多說。　讀者王準謹上　（二月四日）</p>

<h3 id="c47">今後政治之希望 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>八九年來，全國軍民流汗流血，飲泣吞聲以求者，是要驅逐日宼，並在驅逐日寇以後，建設一個富強康樂的新中國。我們要保障國家的，我們要保障人民的權利，我們要提高人民的生活水準。於今敵人業已屈膝了，然而我們建國的目標，似乎還可望而不可即。就國際關係言，雖然世界和平已有極大的可能性，但還不免有明爭暗鬥，不容我們抱天眞的樂觀。而在國內，內爭的危險雖然大體過去，但各地的擾攘仍未完全結束。況物價暴騰，生產停頓，一般中產階級在迅速破產，以致在勝利歡樂之後，人心已漸由失望而　　，而甚至於怨懟了。政治協商會議和聯合國會議似給國民以希望。然此兩種會議以後，由國際到中國，並未表現一種新的氣象。時局的確在變。然到底是不是眞正變好，此刻還覺言之過早。</p>
<p>全國的人民希望變好。我們也只許變好，不許變壞。但此刻變好的傾向，並不比蠻壞的傾向為多。這原因何在呢？老實說，今天政治上掌權的人固然存心做好，或者也在努力做好，而可惜一般有力份子和集團，似乎謀國的打算還有些重於爭權的打算。儘管蔣主席在大聲疾呼說政治是責任而非權利，但能夠深體力行的實在微乎其微！</p>
<p>政治當然少不了爭權。但爭權是手段，謀國是目的。為謀國而爭權，爭要爭得光明。如不為國家人民的利益打算，則爭權與攘利無異！所貴乎有政治家者，乃在其能高瞻遠矚，為國家作千年萬世之謀。所以政治家必先大下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂。所謂「現實主義」，實在是政治的陷阱。一為眼前的權利打算，或者即變為愚者。再說一句政治少不了爭權。然不擇手段以爭權，急功近利以爭權，則爭權與高儈的投機　　又無異！我們對今日政治上有力諸方面，至少應該提出一種希望，就是他們的聰明才智，切莫只用於如何　就現實以圖一時之便利，而須用於為國家民族永久前途作一精密的安排。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，我國家的國際地位，日益蒙受損傷，而且在繼續蒙受操作。我們在國際事件上不僅沒有發言權，即自身安全也並無保障，而且連關於本國事也幾乎要喪失發言權。我們承認外蒙獨立，原有壯士斷　的悲壯。然東北和新疆，一直在迷離和混沌之中。而在海外，各地華僑被虐害的消息，時有新聞，甚至連　羅越南也想來欺侮中國人。這原因在什麼地方呢？老實說，人必自侮，然後人侮之。我們的不和與無能，使血戰八年爭取的國際地位，在死者之骨未　之時，已經有不保之勢了。而我們政治諸有力方面所以不和與無能者，就是他們儘有很多人將政治手段看作目的，　醉於現實主義之中。因此，不僅對東北之局勢和華僑的慘狀無動於中，而甚至於藉此以為是政治活動的良好機會。今天最大的禍根，便是現實主義！所有分享主義，官僚主義，投機主義，皆其變種！</p>
<p>我們必須由現實主義清醒過來，正視國家的問題！</p>
<p>在今日國際生活時代，一個國家的政治家——如果配說是政治家，首先要考慮一國在世界中地位和政策。我國今日名為四強或五強之一。但不妨拆穿講，實際豈是那麼一回事？然而我們空間不能不圖強。每一個人特別是從事政治運動的人，當前第一事是要使國家成為名符其實的強國。自我陶醉於「四強」「五強」之美名固不可，而迷惑於「和平」理想就以為不必奮發圖強，尤所不許。</p>
<p>我們應知：對內爭政權是一事，對外爭國權是一事。不對外爭國權也罷了，最低限度我們應相戒絕對不以外力為政爭之工具。我們必須了解：中國的環境雖尚不如中東之惡劣，但如果我們不痛下決心，自己的問題自己解決，決不以外力為解決內政的工具，那麼，我們勢必降為國際舞台的傀儡，有如中東諸國！然而，大家對內很熱心，對於國家權利和榮譽，卻反而非常冷靜，噤若寒蟬！</p>
<p>其次，在今天工業時代，工商是國家的命脈。勝利以後，大家忙於爭權，忙於接收。如何生產，無人過問。即以上海而論，百分之九十的工業，五個月來仍在停頓狀態！甚至許多店鋪，還是鐵將軍把門！這何怪乎物價飛漲！如不積極恢復生產和交通，勢必驅資本盡趨於投機囤積之路。一旦無機可投之日，就是全國成為乞丐之時！在這樣破產危機之前，除了恢復秩序交通之外，一方面要解除工商事業的障礙，一方面要扶助生產事業的進行。這包括貪污的杜絕，稅制的改革，匯率的確定，國際貿易的扶植，以及政府各種貸款包銷之鼓勵措施，而最要緊的，是政府必須確立不給正當工商以任何干涉，且必須給以一切便利的政策。然政府固至今無所措施，而各黨派亦未嘗眞正注意，或甚至以國民經濟的破產，不失為政治進攻的機會。</p>
<p>復次，抗戰最後幾年間，政治紀律和社會風氣日趨墜落。最大原因之一，就是公教人員待遇，實在不近情理。奉公守法者不能依法維持一個健康與自尊的生活，是無異逼迫或引誘大家走入邪路。這不僅是一部分人的生活問題和道德問題。國家知識份子生理和精神的摧殘，將使政治和文化破產。其實大家都得生活下去。與其要大家以不公開的方法生存，何如提高他們的待遇，同時嚴禁不法所得？然而，大家對於這一問題也並沒有看得十分嚴重。</p>
<p>最後，一個國家必須統一，必須民主。今天中國似乎只有人以統一和民主作政　的口號，卻沒有想到統一和民主是立國的根本條件，而兩者是一事而非二事。一個國家不統一，根本不是一個國家。我們不贊成　頭政治是一事，但付了慘痛代價所得來的統一必須維護則又是一事。今天在朝者固必須充分了解必經民主自由以求統一，而在野派也須知道今天再要以所謂「自治」來對抗統一，重變「聯省自治」的把戲，也只是政治上的惡劣權謀。今天大家贊成民主，這是再好不過的事。然無疑有人以民主為偽裝，而有人僅以民主為武器，換言之，自己不民主，卻只向人要求民主。殊不知最民主者一定是最後成功者，不必躬自薄而厚責於人的。所以然者，由於大家對民主的信心不足，這也是國家根本危機之所在。</p>
<p>其實，統一也好，民主也好，我們必須實行四件事情：第一，必不以武力為政爭工具，亦即所謂軍隊國家化。但我們因為陳舊眼光，總是迷信武力，直倒今天，還看不出澈底，放棄武力爭權的普遍覺悟。於是對這一問題還在討價還價之中，而國家的損失，人民的痛苦，也就無從計算，並且不在他們的心目之中。第二，必須確保人民的基本權利和自由。人民沒有權利和自由，國家是不會統一的。第三，所謂民主必須經過選舉方式，使人民以其自由意志，選擇其理想的政府。第四，民主政治固然是政黨政治，然其民主政治之所以值得贊成，畢竟因為民主方式，最容易使人才出世。</p>
<p>總而言之，我們以為國家當前大事是：</p>
<p>我們必須確保領土主權之完整。</p>
<p>我們必須保護工商業。</p>
<p>我們必須保障人民的權利和自由。</p>
<p>我們必須保障公教人員生活。</p>
<p>我們必須不以外力武力為政爭工具，進而樹立經由自由普選的政府。</p>
<p>我們必須樹立一個舉國一致人才政府。</p>
<p>這是當前幾個重大目標。但政治協商會議未能對這些人民的要求真正予以解決。不是政治協商會議沒有力量解決，而是根本興趣不在乎此。更老實說，他們都太現實主義。他們都只注意到黨派權利的如何分潤，而絕未嘗注意東北接收和華僑問題，亦未嘗對工商破產提出緊急救濟方案。更使人焦慮的，他們都為一時權宜之計，忽視國家久遠的問題。例如關於憲草問題，五五憲草固不盡滿人意，而會議所主張分省自治，在軍隊未完全國家化以前，勢非導國家於地方割據不可。尤其使人失望的，是各黨派僅以黨派為人才之標準。昔人謂上品無寒門，下品無世族，今天我們也似乎有一種黨派的「喀士德」了！照這樣下去，今後五人一黨，三人一派，就可變庸才為高才了！</p>
<p>政治協商會議，未始沒有功績。它對於解決不詳內爭總算開了一個談判之門；它對於中國的政治之自由競爭總算開了一條道路。至於實際的成就，定國安邦的大計，還得要國民自身努力。</p>
<p>今天在由訓政到憲政時期。國民黨的訓政，沒有將建國完成。政治協商會議亦未能給我們以安全和幸福的保障。假使將來的國民大會只是一個擴大的協商會議，我們實在擔憂。政治協商會議代表中國旣成力量，而這些力量卻只為了爭政權而互相紊制住了。因此，中國需要一個新的力量，這新的力量要代表澈底的民主自由的勢力，來督促大家進行建國的事業，中國政治才有生機。誰是最新的力量？農工，教師，工商業者，自由職業者。是不是要成立一個黨派？不，無黨無派，不分黨派。用什麼方法？用輿論之力，督促政治上的諸力，使他們不得不走民主憲政的正軌。</p>
<p>中國政治能否迅速走上軌道，就要看中國真正愛好自由的份子能否團結起來發動一個有力的運動！</p>

<p>假使有人問起我勝利後本市儀式最隆重，情關最融洽的授勳典禮，那我得直截的告訴他，就是昨天蔣主席夫人宋美齡女士在市政府市長辦公廳裹所舉行的代表蔣主席一慕授勳典禮，這種塲面在陪都也許常會有，可是在淪陷了八年後的上海，還是破題兒第一遭。</p>
<p>典禮開始</p>
<p>午四點鐘，錢市長那間精緻的半圓形辦公廳，驀地的熱閙起來，十五分鐘後，蔣夫人跟陳誠將軍天人譚祥女士翩然出現了。滿室的視綫，不自主地傾集到她們的身上來。蔣夫人穿着墨黑的長袖旗袍，嵌鑲着寳藍的花邊，黑色的高跟鞋，堆滿了一臉笑容。陳夫人穿了一襲絳紅的旗袍，始終緊隨着蔣夫人，這時魏德邁將軍也趕到了，站立在蔣夫人的右邊，授勳典禮正式開始。</p>
<p>宣讀褒詞</p>
<p>四位受獎的美軍將官，一位是定今日回國的駐華美軍空軍總司令史特拉特梅耶將軍，其餘三位是美駐華空軍司令部參謀長麥克納准將，副參謀長伊文斯准將，和魯特克准將。他們軍服平正熨貼，左胸前已綴滿了勳襟，抖擻起加倍的精神，齊整地排列站在蔣主席的肖像下，兩旁樹立着鮮明的黨國旗，首先由黃仁霖將軍用中英文宣讀褒詞，說史將軍在中印緬戰區空軍司令和駐華空軍總司令任內時，對擊敗敵人，中美空軍的合作，中國空軍的訓練，都着有功勳，應授予大綬雲麾勳章和空軍河圖勳章……。麥克納准將因為協助史將軍亦著功勳，故贈與大綬雲麾勳章和空軍洛書勛章……。伊文斯和魯特克兩准將，也因建有功勳，而得到了雲麾勳章和空軍乾元勳章……。此外前駐華美國第十四航空隊司令史通少將，也有大綬勳章和空軍勳章，因史通少將已經回國，這一份的獎章，將由魏德邁將軍代領轉交。</p>
<p>授勛情形</p>
<p>每張褒狀讀完後，就可以看到一位將軍站到蔣夫人而前，百分之百的立正姿勢，蔣夫人親自拿了勳章，綴帶在受獎者的左襟上，又給奪上了大綬，這時候，攝影記者的鎂光燈，閃照不停，鏡箱的開關聲，不絕於耳。蔣夫人握了握受獎者的手，說聲「恭喜」。受獎者點頭稱謝，帶着榮譽的笑臉，回到他的原位，一幅隆重而充滿了色彩的鏡頭，短短的二十分鐘裹，宣告完成。昨天參加典禮的還有航委會主委周至柔，市長錢大鈞，副市長何德奎，秘書長沈士華，警備司令部副司令李及蘭，警察局長宣鐵吾，戰地服務團上海分團主任梅其駒等。</p>
<p>將領簽名</p>
<p>典禮完畢，蔣夫人高擎着酒杯，向各受獎的將軍賀喜，接着又跟魏德邁特軍攀談了十分鐘，只看見她常時點頭微笑，顯得心緒非常愉快，得到獎的美軍將領，先一刻嚴肅緊張的臉龐上，這時候都泛濫着輕快的笑紋，這笑紋包涵着一種榮譽，一種快慰。記者爭取道寶貴的一剎那。走向各將領的跟前，送上了聲聲賀詞，請他一一為本報留下了紀念式的簽名，他們毫不猶豫地簽了。</p>
<p>蔣夫人談</p>
<p>末了，記者逗着蔣夫人，請她講幾句話。她又笑了，她說：她這次到上海來，在勝利後還是第一次，上海本來是她的故鄉，這次重踏上鄉土，看到上海人，心裹感到無限的興奮和愉快。其他實在沒什麼可說的了。是的，蔣夫人跟上海闊別了八年，一旦歸來，愉快程度的深切，竟致欲言無語，這愉快正象徵着上海的未來，上海人不久就會體味到這愉快的溫暖的。</p>

<p>本市豆米行業及米號業同業公會為近日米價上揚，特於九日午後五時召開理監事聯席會，糧政特派員楊錫志亦參加，繼由各理監事檢討說明米價上漲原因：（一）米價數月來源甚平穩，近受金價物價之嚴重刺激。（二）舊曆新年到貨較少，人心看好。（三）米業公會復員期間組織基礎薄弱，近年風行之單帮及不肖之徒，不免乘機高呌抬價。（四）投機家不免高價收講囤積情事。旋經次議：（一）加强米市塲組織管理，非米商不得交易。（二）勸告同業不得抬價，相互檢舉。（三）切實防止非同業之搜購，並由各會員負責檢舉投機份子，呈請當局懲辦。（四）希望當局普遍穩定物價。（五）請糧政當局繼續拋售食米，由公會負責經辦。惟價格不宜過低，以免套購。旋經楊氏表示，將會同軍警當局檢查倉庫，嚴禁投機囤積，並酌視情形委托公會在市塲以較市價略低之價格繼續拋售食米，藉以調節民食，充實糧源，而收平穩糧價之效，並非低價平賣，蓋分配難求其平，徒利少數人這套購。</p>

<p>（本報訊）紗布市價，邇來上漲甚烈，中國紡織建設公司之掛牌價，亦逐期步漲，如一月末期四十二支紗為九十餘萬元，廿支為五十五萬元，但至二月十日四十二支已開一百四十三萬元，二十支八十二萬元，自二月一日至十日止，該公司公開價四次，其間二十支紗雖有三期站定六十八萬，然品質第一期為藍鳳，第二期為月琴，三期則降至　女及無牌，無形中已將價格抬漲，較之舊曆年關已漲起三四成左右，各方對此，咸頗關心，據染織業公會負責人潘士浩氏語人，此種情形，全出於供求不相稱，蓋舊曆年底紗布廠家大部份已接受定貨，就一般織造白坯布廠家而言，最近十數日以內，正謀解交定貨之不暇，實無法再供應現銷，而紡織建設公司自紅盤後，並無坯布開出，各加工染廠因已於年前拋售定貨，遂不得不在市面上採購坯布，以便染色交貨，於是供應不調，市價遂漲，且客帮接內地來電，以民間衣着品缺乏已久，紛催趕補紗布，市價更難平東和，各染織廠因大都已於舊曆年前拋售定貨，頗受損失，紡織建設公司設再不開售坯布，則廠有與客帮將益感困難云，潘氏並指稱本市民榮染織廠，共有布機約一萬台，大部份已在舊曆新年準備開工，最近紡織建設公司每期均有紗開出，但為數不多，是以廠家頗望其能增加開售數額，俾得開工，柸布廠家在舊曆新年，催停工三日，目前正在趕緊出發應市，以免市面再起瀾，如國營紗布廠能增加其開額，注意於民營工業紗綫及原價自可漸次平復，並聞染織公會自紡織建設公司辦理紗布廠商登記後，該會已將會員登記卡，按日彙轉該公司，並已云函申請開售柸布，以應急需，但據紡建公司方面透露消息，因政府需要軍用布疋，一時恐不克以大量供給民用，查紡建接辦之布廠，每日可出布五千疋左右，按其生產能力，可加至每日數萬疋云。</p>

<h3 id="c80">當前的勞工問題 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 王鷺</p>
<p>在目前的工業界裏，勞工問題，是相當嚴重的，這不但在中國，在美國也是如此。</p>
<p>美國在勝利以後，第一個遇到的問題，就是勞工問題，勞工的工作時間自每週四十八小時恢復到四十小時後，他們的收入也就跟着减少，而資方曾嚴詞拒絕加薪的要求。杜魯門總統曾於去年，十一月中召開全國勞資協商會議。</p>
<p>在三星期的勞資協商會議以後，勞工問題並沒有解次，美國目前因為勞資爭執，離開工作的工人已將近二百萬，這數目和美國勞工的總數相比較，固然不多，但是罷工的風潮，牽動了美國經濟。汽車工業罷工的工人有二十多萬，已佔全部工人的一半以上，其他已經罷工的，有屠宰工業，木材工業，鋼鐵工業等。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統最近的措施，就是從事事實眞相的調查，以便動用輿論的力量來解次問題。但這種措施，並不能護得勞資雙方的同情。在勞方講：因為在着手調查的三十天內，不能罷工或罷業，使他們失去了一種武器；在資方講，他們不願意公開他們的　册。</p>
<p>其實這種互相猜疑的情形，正是阻礙勞資雙方合作的最大原因，事實上資方缺不了勞工，勞工也缺不了資方。資方所希望的是獲得合法的利潤，勞工所希望的是享受安定的生活，雙方絕對應該平心靜氣的討論，設法應付環境的艱難。</p>
<p>中國工業，在勝利以後，亟需努力建設，即使一點也不遲延，一點也沒有阻礙，要趕上前進國家的地步，已經十分困難了，所以絕對不容，因為勞工問題而失去寶貴的時機。因此中國勞工問題，必需合理地解次，最合理的方法，就是由勞資雙方毫無隔膜，坦白率直地，以事實為根據，而訂出有利於勞資雙方，及事業前途的互惠辦法。</p>
<h3 id="c81">福特汽車公司的復興工作 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 清和</p>
<p>無論那一種事業，都要不斷努力地進行，方能維持固有的地位，我國人也公認創業難，守成也不容易。最近美國福特汽車公司的創辦人亨利福特正式告退，由他的孫兒繼任，我們正可以注意今後的發展。年輕的福特担負起復興福特汽車公司的責任。這種情形，和我國一部份實業界傳代的方式不同。</p>
<p>最近在美國第屈勞城，最新鮮的談話資料，除了勞工問題之外，就要輪到亨利福利二世的如何繼承他的祖父，以發揚福特汽車公司的事業了。</p>
<p>他在當地的名字是被稱做年輕的亨利，或是亨利二世的。他目前正在做着一種試騐的工作，就是他的才能終究怎樣，在這種情形之下，他不得不以事實來表現他的本領。在幾年之前，他是一個藍眼睛，有着蘋菓般的紅面頰，安靜而愉快的靑年，他並沒有什麼特殊的特點表顯出來。以前他可以無心無事，自由自在地生活著，但自從一九四四年八月中他的父親去世以後，他就繼承父親的職位，在福特公司裏做第二把交椅的重要人物。福特公司的同業對於他，具有一種同情心，但並沒有恐懼的心理，因為他對於汽車事業，還需要不斷地學習。</p>
<p>他在第一次接見新聞記者的時候，曾經自認是非常年靑，一點也不懂事，他在接受了像皇位一樣的職位之後，依舊很坦白地說他正有許多事情需要學習。但事實上他對於汽車事業，早已有相當的了解。</p>
<p>福特汽車公司的最重要的三個問題，就是（一）怎樣應付在變動中的環境，（二）怎樣維持固有的長處，（三）怎樣維持新聞界的良好關係。在過去，福特公司曾經大量生產戰時的車輛，他們的宣傳，給予人一種印象，就是福特公司是始終站在前面的。對於新聞界的關係方面，在幾年前曾有一個新聞記者說要在福特公司裏調查出他們的行動，正像到蘇聯去採訪新聞一般地困難。但在近年以來，福特公司的主持人員，對於新聞界所提出的問題，可以無問不答。年輕的亨利，目前要做到的就是怎探去促進那種良好關係而施行他們固有的政策。福特汽車公司，有一個特性，就是亨利福特在創辦以後，不久就賺了很多的錢，把其餘股東的股份都收買下來，福特的一家人擁有大量的股份，因此就成為一個私人的家庭化公司，祇要賺來的錢能够應付股東的利益，就可以使他們非常江意，不像其他的公司，股東的數目很多，做一個主持人員，很不容易討好。</p>
<p>然而近年以來，福特公司的營業是在退步，在第一次世界大戰的時候，福特公司的營業額，佔居全國汽車營業百分之六十，到了第二次世界大戰的時候，他門的營業，佔不到全國營業的百分之二十，所以福特汽車公司，因為歷年從盈餘項下提付股東的利息，將把所有的盈餘付完了。</p>
<p>年輕的福特，在辦事方面，很能够獲得老福特的贊美，雖則未必贊成他所做的每一件事。自從他接手以後，第一步就增强推銷部份的力量，又將推銷，製造和工程部份，盡力聯繫起來，他的目標是要把福特汽車公司，依舊進步到第一位，無疑地他已經負起了復興福特汽車公司的重任。</p>
<h3 id="c82">針織品的過去與未來 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 張鴻勳</p>
<p>針織品是輕工業之一，也可說是每個人必需品，國人設廠自織，衹有短短數十年歷史。即以襪廠而論，也狠幼稚，昔日國人崇尚儉樸，大都布衣布襪，在民國初年，始有英國貨鷹球牌綫襪來華，當時祇分黑白兩種顏色，初次來華推銷因比布襪舒適，售價便宜，大衆開始改穿，日後國人也創設襪廠，從事仿製，藉卜微利，終以資本短少，因陋就簡，不能大量生產，與外貨相競爭，後來美國進口一種花襪，來華傾銷，國人愛其花色美觀，大受歡迎，當時筆者本在針織業機械服務，目擊如此利權外溢，就在民國十五年創辦康福襪廠，首先專門製造各種花襪，行銷全國，雖不能和舶來品抗庭，但是也可以挽救其一部份，就是國外南洋菲洲各地在太平洋戰事之前，也有大量批發和經銷。</p>
<p>時代不斷的改進，各界需要，與日俱進，普通綫襪亟應大量生產，而由於服裝的改換，花襪也漸漸被人注意，普遍使用，就是窮鄕僻壤之區，也風行起來，所以對於各種出品，質料方面，第一要堅固，花色方面，也要日新月異，顏色當然要久洗不變，方才可以談到抵制外貨，挽回利權，推銷國產目的，要做到以上所談的情形必須要有龐大雄厚的資本，精良的機械，培植專門技術人才，自織，自染，自己整理，應潮流進展，不斷改良，精益求精，大量生產，努力建設，自問一廠能力有限，希望全國針織界，聯合起來，共同奮鬥。八年的抗戰，各處交通阻梗，現下河山重光，各地通行，輕工業前途，有更大的發展，日寇屈膝求和，對內需要，尚難應付，對外貿易，勢必全部放棄，昔日南洋市場，大部操於日人之手，乘此大好機會，正可以從事攫取，所以針織業實在是今後最好發展的時期。</p>

<p>採棉機器</p>
<p>美國萬國農具公司費了大部份時間製造一種採棉機器，在離開克拉克達二哩的棉田裏試騐，很具成效，每一次把機車開過晨田，可以採得百分之九十五的棉花，其餘剩下來的是沒有結成的枯枝，用手採取的成本是每包四十元，用了機器，成本祗有七元五角。</p>
<p>採取棉花，利用機器以後，可以使美國棉花的成本减低，到國際市塲上去競爭。</p>
<p>直接郵遞食品</p>
<p>美國最近已開始用直接郵遞的方法銷售食品，包括麵粉食品和蔬菜，在戰時歐洲曾由這個方法獲得一部份食品。在美國農園的數目，迅速增加，在一九四四年的年底，有五千五百個農園，預計到一九五〇年，可以增加到一萬五千所。</p>

<p>— 費文</p>
<p>在戰後復興和建設的過程中，人才的訓練，是刻不容緩的，英國勞工部最近發表一種政府補救戰時事業中輟的計劃，就是各地技術學院與商學院，將給予復員男女三個月的商業管理的訓練，受訓人員，務必曾於軍隊，商船隊，國防工作，煤礦中正式服務一年以上，並且能够證明他們的事業在二十一歲以前或事業經營未及二年，即因戰事而停上。受訓的人員，在必要時可以獲得津貼。</p>
<p>在美國，工人敎育的發展，已成為成人教育的一個重要部份。美國的工人敎育注重團體問題的研究，內容包括從工會行政的技能以至社會科學，美國勞工歷史和勞工哲學的研究。敎育的方法，包括一切敎育上的技術，如課室演講，討論，廣播，唱片，表演，電影，和戲劇。除課室上課之外，還有娛樂和文化活動。最近還有餘康敎育和如何在生活上避免危險的敎育，也有醫學方面的照料。</p>

<p>— 棟</p>
<p>在一般工廠之中，很感覺痛苦的就是人才問題，尤其是中級的人才。高級的職員，固然具有新頴的思想，前進的精神，可是沒有人能够了解他們，使他們的理想成為事實，這原因就是缺少中級的得力份子。</p>
<p>在國外的工廠裏，爲了使有志上進的職員，為工廠作更多的貢獻的的起見，往往有小董事會Junior　Board　of　Directors成立，牠的任務，就是按實際情形，加以研究，供給最高當局的採取，小董事會由比較肯前進而努力的高級職員組織起來，這樣不但可以加强中級職員的辦事效能，更能够造就許多管理人才。從前上海的美國商會中，也有小董事會的設立，由一般靑年人組織起來。</p>
<p>中國有一部份廠商的董事會，並不負起董事會的責任，近於虛設，今後要使工業發展，董事們應該切切實實地董事，同時小董事會的設立，也可以解決當前的人才缺乏問題。</p>

<p>— 羅立羣</p>
<p>縫紉工業約定義很廣：凡是用整塊原料，經過裁剪縫紉而製成的一種工業製品，統稱為縫紉工業，如內衣業，西服業，帽葉，鞋業，手帕業，皮革製品業等，牠們不但佔人生上必需品的一項，而且在戰時就可以改為軍需工業，所以縫紉工業，也可以稱為國防上的輕工業。</p>
<p>縫紉工業，除了應該注意技巧之外，對於縫紉所用的綫，是十分重要的，縫紉工業所用的錢，主要的是木紗綫，牠的優劣的分別，在於拉力堅靱，光滑平柔。飛輪牌本紗團在歷年以來，因為品質優良，很為各方面愛護，使用以後，可以沒有「脫鈕」「裂縫」等弊病，所以在選擇本紗團的時候，是値得注意的。</p>
<h3 id="c87">工業界的戰士：吳蘊初先生 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>天廚味精廠的創辦人吳蘊初先生，回到上海，將近四十天，因為平日抱定着苦幹實幹的精神，並不注重無謂的宣傳和酬酢，因此並沒有發表過什麼言論。這次筆者去拜訪吳先生時，他開頭就說沒有什麼特殊的意見發表，　所努力的，就是做他本份以內的工作。本文所述，就是吳先生手創的三個重要工業的情况。</p>
<p>吳先生在年輕時就是一個古幹的人，在中學畢業以後，因為性之所近，考入陸軍部上海兵工專門學校的化學科，畢業後曾先後祖任過兵工專校的化學敎授，兵工鍊鋼的技師，漢口熾昌硝鹼公司總經理兼總技師，漢陽兵工廠理化課長兼製藥課長製酸課長等，到民國十二年，味精試騐成功，就創辦天廚味精廠。</p>
<p>製造味精的原料，最重要的是麵筋和鹽酸，如果這種重要的原料，要仰仗外界供給，終不是一個辦法，尤其因為鹽酸是日本出品，於是就創設上海澱粉廠，來供給天廚廠所需要的麵筋，又創辦天原電化廠，來供給天廚廠所需要的鹽酸。</p>
<p>在天原電化廠的出品中，除鹽酸之外，又有漂白粉和燒鹹，都是重要的工業原料，但是有大量的氫，如果不加利用，非常可惜，因此接着就創辦天利淡氣製品廠。</p>
<p>淡氣製品的領域，非常廣大，不但是一種重要的化學工業，更是一種重要的國防工業。在該廠開幕紀念册裘，吳先生曾叙述當時的籌備經過說：「民國二十一年美國杜滂公司在西雅圖地方之合成氬（即合成氨）廠有出售意，派員與接洽時，適有歐美之行，因前往視察，見其機械設備，尚稱良好，乃開始磋商，迄民廿二年十一月而議成，當此議甫興時，天廚天原兩公司之股東，均願對天利投資，雖告以基本化學工業資本巨而利潤微，然認股者仍踴躍，百萬資金，不崇朝而集，至二十三年一月，乃告成立，嗣實業部決定自辦硫酸铔廠，委實業家范旭柬先生主持，為分一工合作計，為適應工業緊切之需要計，與范先生商討後，乃注全力於硝酸之製造，並決定用空氣法，即向法國購置日產硝酸十二噸之機械全組。七月復渡歐視察所訂購之機械，及調查硝酸製法之進展狀况，十月回國，積極裝置，時　廠機械已先運滬，至年底酸廠機械亦分批到齊。至廿四年八月而無水　（即液氨）出品，九月而淡硝酸出品，十月而濃硝酸出品，十一月而硫酸濃縮裝置完成。</p>
<p>據吳先生原定的計劃，硝酸可以製造炸藥，可以貢獻於國防，更想進一步因具有製造輕氣的經驗用輕化石炭法，製造人造汽油，特親自到德國去訂購機器，在八一三的下午五點鐘回到上海，已經在上午十時展開了戰爭。</p>
<p>自從八一三後，就不得不隨着政府內遷，最初到達漢口，把廠房建設還不到一半，南京淪陷，漢口告急，就不得不犧牲已成的工作，再分別到香港和重慶，在兩地建設起來。在香港製造味精和鹽酸，在重慶製造漂白粉，燒鹹等化學原料供給造紙肥皂廠</p>
<p>到內地建設工廠，因為物質條件的限制如交運工具，建築器財的缺乏，至少要加倍的力量，困難重重，痛苦不堪言狀。自從太平洋戰事發生以後，港廠因為拒絕與敵人合作，自行將重要機件毀壞後並將最重要的機件移渝供英大使維證明以維中國人民在國際的信譽。港廠就被日寇佔據，滬南新橋路的味精工場和瞿眞人路的澱粉和葡萄糖等工場，都被敵人毁壞，到了目前，已經成為一片空地。目前僅利用上海菜市路包裝部舊址作小規模生產</p>
<p>今後的工作，在目前經濟困難工潮勃興的環境之下就要牠這一個殘局收拾整理起來，重新建設，但憑着吳先生堅强的毅力，和飽滿的精神，一定可以在萬難之中，完成復興的工作。</p>
<p>在抗戰期間工業界的聯合組織中，初富於歷史性而有相當力量的，一個是以上海工業家為主的遷川工廠聯合會，一個是全國工業協會，總會在三十二年，四月二十二日在重慶成立，各工業區設有分會，以求工廠與工廠，工業與政府，工業界與外界的聯繫。吳先生就是現任全國工業協會，及前任遷川工廠聯合會的理事長，最近全國工業協會理監事已經集會把該會總會遷到上海。</p>
<p>中國化工人才的缺乏和需要，吳先生平就看到，在民國二十年三月創立淸寒敎育基金，曾經培植不少有用人才。</p>
<p>吳先生致力化學工業，幾十年如一日，衹求事業有進步，並不希望獲得金錢的酬報，所以在平時不斷前進，在戰時努力奮鬥，實在可以說是中國工業界的一個英勇的戰士，可以作爲一般致力於工業者為榜樣。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Government Reorganization: Distribution of Positions - Various Parties Continue to Exchange Opinions; Military Reorganization Conference to be Held in Beijing Mid-Month <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 10th] It is reported that regarding the distribution of positions in the government reorganization, various parties continue to exchange opinions. Disputes over the membership of the National Government Committee remain intense. The Communists, still claiming the status of the second-largest party, insist on a majority. Within the 20 positions allocated to various parties, factions, and independents, they demand to occupy ten positions. The Democratic League has already echoed this demand. However, the Youth Party adamantly refuses to concede. General observation suggests that the Communist demand is excessively extravagant. If their demand is eventually reduced to seven or eight positions, they may still have hope of maintaining a majority.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 10th] It is reported that after the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference, the central government, to thoroughly implement military reorganization, has decided to convene a military reorganization conference in Beijing in mid-month. All military officers with the rank of division commander or above will attend. The personnel from this area who are required to attend have already received the order and are preparing to travel there at the appointed time.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 10th] When the Political Consultative Conference concluded, Chairman Chiang announced the release of political prisoners. Liao Chengzhi and many others have already been released successively. Another large group of political prisoners are also being actively considered for release soon. Ye Ting, the former commander of the Communist New Fourth Army, engaged in armed separatism and attacked anti-Japanese troops during the emergency of the war, obstructing national law and military discipline, which made it necessary to imprison him. According to reliable sources, Mr. Ye may be released shortly after the current batch of political prisoners. Government officials, military personnel, Kuomintang members, Kuomintang civil servants, and other education, transportation, and business personnel who have been imprisoned by the Communist army in recent years may also be freed in the near future. General Ma Fawu, who was illegally captured by the Communist army several months ago, may be released by Yan'an at the same time as Ye Ting.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Active Preparations Underway to Restore Traffic on Four Major Railway Trunk Lines - Over a Thousand Technical Personnel Have Arrived at Work Sites <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 10th] Minister of Communications Yu Feipeng returned to Nanjing yesterday. According to him, the ministry is making every effort to overcome all difficulties in preparing to restore traffic on the four major trunk lines: Jiaoji (Jiaozhou-Jinan), Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou), Pinghan (Beijing-Hankou), and Longhai (Lanzhou-Lianyungang). Thousands of railway construction engineering technicians have already arrived at various work sites according to the established plan. The required materials, after being pieced together from various sources, are barely sufficient to meet the needs of some key sections at present. The urgent work spirit of the personnel rushing to the designated sections for emergency repairs is like that of firefighters arriving at a fire scene or epidemic doctors at the bedside of patients. He firmly believes that the restoration of domestic railway traffic is truly just around the corner. The people of the country are now eagerly awaiting national unification and the restoration of transportation. The colleagues in the Ministry of Communications share the same sentiment. The Ministry has suspended all non-urgent tasks and is dedicating its full strength to repairing the railways. It is also heard that the railway equipment shipped by the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to China has not yet been shipped. Relevant parties have sent telegrams urging them.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 10th] Yu Feipeng will soon come to Beiping again to instruct the restoration of transportation work in North China. He will enjoy the leadership of the transportation inspection corps under 黻. Furthermore, the transportation authorities deeply feel the lack of railway technical staff. They recently intend to request the relevant authorities to approve the continued use of Japanese prisoners of war to build railways. It is said that the Japanese prisoners have achieved quite good results in building roads in the Shijiazhuang area.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 10th] The Pinghan Railway is being actively repaired. 150 kilometers of steel rails and 140,000 railway sleepers have been transported to the damaged locations. If the work proceeds smoothly, the entire line is expected to be open to traffic by mid-March.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 9th] Regarding the restoration of transportation, a Communist spokesperson hinted that the general principles may be established soon. The joint chief of staff meeting has been suspended for the past few days because the Communist army chief of staff, Luo Ruiqing, went to Zhangjiakou. Mr. Luo returned to Beiping on the 7th, and the meeting can be reopened. The spokesperson also denied that the Communist side wants to control a portion of the railway and 百陈述 their desire to participate in national railway 管理. He also hinted that American personnel from the Executive Headquarters may also participate in the management in the future.</p>

<p>[Our Jinan Correspondent, 9th] Because the military and civilians in Taian have been out of food for nine days, the government sent airplanes to drop 2 million legal tender and 20,000 steamed buns. Also, dozens of Communist army soldiers in plainclothes infiltrated the southwest gate of Yanzhou on the night of the 7th and fired into the city, wounding one member of the public consolation delegation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 10th] Brigadier General Byroade returned to Beiping today, carrying a solution to stop the conflict in Taian, which was decided after a four-hour meeting between Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai. The solution will be announced in Beiping. According to reliable sources, this agreement will serve as a precedent for future reference. [Our Beiping Correspondent, 9th] There is hope for a solution to the Taian problem. Colonel Rake of the Jinan Group returned to Jinan today to carry out mediation. Chen Shiju, concurrently the commander of the Shandong Military Region of the New Fourth Army, explained that the cause of the twists and turns in Taian was due to the difficulty in communication and liaison within the Communist army, which led to the agreement established by the commander of the New Fourth Army, Chen Yi, and Colonel Rake in Linyi on the 3rd of this month failing to arrive in Taian on the morning of the 4th, so some misunderstandings may have occurred at that time. In his conversation, Mr. Chen absolutely guaranteed that the Communist side would seek a prompt and proper solution to the Taian food shortage in accordance with the Linyi agreement. If this is the case, the Taian problem should not be difficult to solve. [Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 10th] Colonel Harris, Xie Huizhuang, and Wang Shiying of the Xuzhou Group of the Military Mediation Executive Department flew to Lincheng by special plane on the morning of the 10th to meet with Chen Daqing and continue negotiations. The Communist army requested the withdrawal of the National Army from Lin and Zao, and offered to cede the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in exchange. At the same time, the management and security rights for repairing the railway in the Communist-controlled area are insisted upon by the Communist army. The group has telegraphed Beiping for instructions and flew back to Xuzhou from Lincheng on the same day.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 9th] The people of the Hankou Group returned to Beiping today. According to them, an agreement has been reached among the three parties regarding the purchase and transportation of food for the Communist army in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 10th] The Shijiazhuang Military Mediation Executive Group held a meeting on the afternoon of the 8th with the highest commanders of the National and Communist armies in the local area to exchange opinions and provide relevant materials on military conflicts. It is heard that a military agreement here will take about a week to establish. According to Mr. Golbo, the American representative, after the group arrived, they learned that there were still small-scale Wei Tu conflicts in nearby villages. After mediation, the Wei Tu conflicts have stopped. There are still some difficulties in the meeting, but it is believed that they can be overcome with human effort. Furthermore, Wang Yunrui, commander of the Fourth Military Region of the Communist Army's Jinan Military Region, Qin Jiwei, commander of the First Army of the Taihang Military Region, and Tao Xijin, chief of staff of the Taihang Military Region, arrived in Shijiazhuang on the evening of the 8th so that the executive group could listen to reports from both sides at any time.</p>

After the meeting proceeded as usual, disturbances occurred at the venue. Liu Yebang, Li Gongpu, and others were injured. The meeting was later resumed, a declaration was passed, and the meeting adjourned at around 11:00 am. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fighting Over the Title of General Chairman</p>
<p>The meeting had been in preparation for a long time. The people actually responsible for the preparation were Zhang Naiqi, Li Gongji, and others. On the evening of the 9th, it was decided at Zhang Naiqi's place in the Qianchuan Building that the candidates for the presidium of the meeting would be Liu Ye from the Municipal Farmers' Association 　, Tan Zesen from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Zhou Dehou from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wu Renchu from the education circle, Chuan Boqun from the women's circle, and representatives from all walks of life 　　 Hang, Guo Dequan, Zhang Naiqi, Gu Feng, Li Gongpu, Zhang Mian, Li Dequan, Li Senpu, Shi Liang, Shi Fuliang, Huang Cixian, and others, and Guo Moruo, Shao Lizi, Zhou Enlai, Li Zhuchen, Shen Jun　 and others were invited to participate. At around 9:00 am on the morning of the 10th, the masses who participated in the meeting arrived successively, including about 400 people from the Labor Association, about 100 people from Yucai School, more than 100 people from Xinhua Daily, and about 2,000 people from the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other groups. At 9:30 am, when the meeting started, Zhang Naiqi of the presidium proposed that Li Dequan be the general chairman, while Zhou Dehou reported at the venue in an expanded voice: The most farmers in our country,提譏with Liu Yeqiao, the representative of the Farmers’ Association, as the general chairman. The people applauded to express their approval, and Liu announced the start of the meeting immediately. When giving his opening remarks, Li Gongpu prevented Liu from speaking because Liu should not serve as the general chairman, and夺 went to Liu's hand's microphone. For a while, the audience　然, and the masses surged onto the podium, the order was disturbed, and they beat each other. Liu Yeqiao and Li Gongpu were both injured in the head, Zhu Qirui in the hand, Shi Fuliang in the leg, and Guo Moruo also suffered a slight injury on his left forehead.</p>
<p>Military Police Maintain Order</p>
<p>At this time, the military police rushed to mediate and protect Shen Jun　. Guo Moruo and others came out of the venue, Li Gongpu and others went to the Municipal Hospital for medical treatment, and Liu Yeqiao also withdrew due to injury, and Zhou De　 acted as chairman to continue the meeting. After several citizens gave speeches, the declaration was passed, and the meeting was adjourned with shouts of slogans. After the meeting, Liu Yeqiao hosted reporters at the Bailing Restaurant and reported on the situation of being beaten, roughly saying: The representatives of the people's groups from the Municipal Farmers, Industry, and Commerce were promoted to the presidium last night. During the meeting this morning, it was unexpected that the members of the Labor Association and the students of Yucai participated in the beating, causing the presidium Li Gongpu and I to be injured. It is really unfortunate. In the past, the Cangbai Memorial Hall has been sabotaged repeatedly, and the truth of the facts can be known from today's disputes. He also said: Citizen Huang Jianhui witnessed Qin Hu and Xie Zhishang being arrested by members of the Labor Association. It can be clearly seen who is trampling on human rights, etc.</p>
<p>Li Gongpu and Guo Moruo Slightly Injured</p>
<p>The reporter then went to the Municipal Hospital to visit Li Gongpu. Li's head was wrapped in gauze, and he had already walked out of the hospital gate. At this time, Luo Longji, Zhou Enlai, and others also rushed to the hospital. Seeing Li coming out, they waited carefully and brought Li back to the hospital. The reporter asked Dr. Shi Liansheng, a doctor at the hospital. He specially signed the certificate as follows: "Patient Li Gongpu Hospital Number (8184), Jiangsu native, male, 46 years old, found to have a scalp laceration, about two centimeters long, this is." According to Yin Gongzhen, the director of affairs at the hospital, Guo Moruo, Shi Fuliang, and four injured people from the Labor Association also went to the hospital for examination and fluoroscopy. Because they were slightly injured, they all left the hospital after being treated.</p>
<p>Li Dequan Hosted Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>At 3:00 pm, the meeting held a press conference at the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, which was presided over by Li Dequan. He first stated: The mass meeting in the capital to celebrate the success of the Political Consultative Conference was prepared by more than 20 groups in this city and spent 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. It was unexpected that it was disrupted by rioters at the Xiaochangkou meeting today, and Mr. Li Gongpu, Guo Moruo, Shi Fuliang, and other gentlemen were injured. The preparatory committee of the meeting had proposed Mr. Zhang Naiqi as the general chairman, but Liu Yeqiao took over as the chairman at today's meeting.</p>
<p>Zhang Naiqi and Others Report on the Process</p>
<p>Regarding the process of the meeting, I would now like to invite the executives of the association and Mr. Zhang Naiqi to report separately. After the executives of the meeting reported on the preparation process, Zhang Naiqi continued: I would like to correct Mr. Li Dequan’s report, that the preparatory committee of the meeting had nominated people as the general chairman. I am not the general chairman, but one of the members of the presidium who was scheduled to speak first. The association had previously invited all walks of life in the capital to participate, but at about 10:00 pm last night, representatives from several groups such as the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Municipal Education Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce came to our residence and held a public letter requesting to join the meeting. I believe that since this is a joint celebration of all walks of life in the capital, then all the people of the capital can participate. Unexpectedly, several rioters suddenly came to the meeting this morning, stepped onto the podium, occupied the broadcast device, and elected Liu Yeqiao, the representative of the Municipal Farmers' Association, as the chairman. Mr. Li Gongpu was injured when he went forward to stop him, because the chairman was elected by the preparatory committee and could not be elected temporarily, causing a disturbance, etc. After Zhang finished his inquiry, they unanimously advocated to immediately express condolences to those who were injured today.</p>

<h3 id="e26">First Time in Eight Years: Nationwide Elections Held in the Soviet Union; Stalin Delivered a Radio Address the Night Before, Saying Equal Distribution of Markets Can Avert War <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 10th] Soviet citizens today held their first elections in eight years to elect representatives to the Supreme Soviet. Citizens over the age of 18 have the right to vote. Voting in Moscow began at 6:00 AM. Although the temperature was below freezing, the polling places were crowded. Until the midnight deadline, the crowds were still packed. The only way to oppose the election of Communist Party candidates is to submit a blank ballot. In the 1937 election, there were only 632,000 votes against out of a total of 100 million votes.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] The Soviet Union will hold nationwide elections on the 10th. The elections are not limited to Soviet territory. Military personnel and civilians overseas, as well as passengers on merchant ships on the high seas, have the opportunity to vote. Soviet occupation forces in enemy territory have the privilege of electing one representative for every 100,000 voters, or one representative for every 300,000 people. Special polling districts are set up in the far north, Siberia, and mountainous areas. Passengers on trains can also vote if they can prove their right to vote.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Marshal Stalin delivered an election eve speech in Moscow last night, his first broadcast since his victory speech on Japan's unconditional surrender on September 2 of last year. When the speaker invited Stalin to speak, applause thundered for eight minutes. Stalin said, "War is not an accidental occurrence, but is caused by inevitable economic forces and is the result of world trends. Groups of capitalist countries believe that they are not as fortunate as other countries in terms of raw materials and attempt to change their position by force, resulting in war. The Soviet Union's participation greatly strengthened the anti-fascist and liberating nature of the war. As far as we are concerned, this was the most brutal war in our history, but it was also a test of our national strength. Marxists have repeatedly declared that the capitalist system of the world economy contains aggression and armed conflict, and now the development of world capitalism is not proceeding smoothly, but is experiencing various crises and disasters. In fact, the inequality between capitalist countries is constantly attempting to change the situation by force to benefit themselves. As a result, the capitalist world is divided into opposing camps and engaged in war. If it were possible to divide export markets equally between countries, then war tragedies might be avoided. But this cannot be implemented in the current state of the world economy under capitalism. Therefore, the capitalist system of the world economy creates a situation that prompted the outbreak of World War I. World War II also occurred due to the second crisis within the capitalist system."</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 10th Broadcast: The Security Council discussed the issue of British troops staying in Indonesia this afternoon, with no results. The discussion was rescheduled for tomorrow afternoon. Before the adjournment, the Dutch Foreign Minister gave a speech, saying that the presence of British troops in Indonesia did not endanger peace.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 10th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a long speech in the Security Council today, expressing a serious protest against a certain major power placing the issue of British troops staying in Indonesia on the agenda. It is claimed that the representative of a certain major power cannot prove it with facts and insists on proposing to send a delegation to Indonesia for inspection, which is inappropriate. The presence of British troops in Indonesia is to assist the Dutch army in accepting the surrender of the Japanese army. Now, a certain representative insists that British troops endanger peace, which is improper. As for the Soviet representative Vyshinsky's statement that since the British side has sent Kerr to Indonesia, other countries can also take the same measures, Bevin replied: Kerr's visit to Indonesia is not for negotiation, but only for political advisory work. Regarding the Ukrainian representative's accusation that British troops are using Japanese soldiers to fight in Indonesia, Bevin said: "Only once have a small number of Japanese soldiers been used as guards, because at that time, many women, children, and British soldiers were in danger." Bevin accused Ukraine of not making unfounded attacks without consulting or inquiring with the British government beforehand.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] At today's meeting of the United Nations Security Council, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky said in his speech that the East Indian dispute is the spark for World War III. The Council should send a committee to investigate on the ground, consisting of representatives from China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands. Vyshinsky spoke for two hours, and Ukraine seconded the motion.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Sex Hormones Have Miraculous Effects in Treating Cancer <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] The "Freedom" magazine published an article by Dr. Haming, saying that sex hormones have proven to be the only effective chemical weapons for treating cancer. Male and female sex hormones seem to have mutually hostile tendencies in the human body. If cancer occurs on the sex organs, treatment with hormones is particularly effective. For example, breast cancer in women can cause serious damage because the female hormones in the body stimulate the growth of the breast, seemingly also stimulating the growth of cancer with the same force. But if male hormones are injected, they seem to be able to counteract the effect of female hormones, delaying the growth of cancer. Similarly, when a man suffers from cancer in the accessory sex organ prostate gland, the secretions of the man's testicles will also promote the growth of cancer. At this time, using female hormones can stop it. Although this treatment cannot eradicate the disease, it does have the power to prolong life and relieve infinite suffering.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Thousands of British military and civilians who lost their sight during the war have been fitted with lifelike plastic eyes that can move with muscle contractions and even blink. These artificial eyes were originally a secret of the German scientific community, but the artificial eyes created by British scientists during the war have become even more advanced than those of the Germans.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 9th] After the floods in the Rhine region, the situation in western Germany is serious. Food reserves are about to run out, and the situation is precarious. Railway traffic on the Rhine has been cut off. Coal in the Ruhr region cannot be transported to France, and traffic between the British and American occupation zones has also been blocked.

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 10th Dispatch] The Wisconsin Astronomical Observatory in the United States discovered today that the atomic explosion that occurred during the explosion of the Northern Crown Constellation was millions of times more violent than the atomic bomb that hit Japan. Astronomers around the world have been actively observing this stellar phenomenon, as this phenomenon may be of value for atomic research. According to the observatory's report, the brightness of this constellation during the explosion was a thousand times brighter than it was two weeks ago, so it may be a reborn nova. A nova is a star whose luminosity suddenly increases and emits a huge amount of energy, and then returns to a relatively stable state. Astronomers believe that this explosion is basically the same as the principle of atomic energy application. Observations of this nova may be extremely important for the interpretation of stars and contribute to atomic energy research.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Minden (Germany), 10th] Professor Huen, a German atomic expert, told visiting journalists yesterday that the pressure of the light emitted when an atomic bomb explodes is extremely great and can even destroy walls. Few people know that pressure is generated when light reflects on solids. If it is ordinary light, this kind of pressure has little relevance, but the light emitted when an atomic bomb explodes is so strong that it has significant destructive power. The heat generated by absorption can ignite any non-flammable material. Professor Huen won the 1939 Nobel Prize for discovering the secret of atomic fission, but under the Nazi regime, Germans were not allowed to accept the Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>Kunshan: The 21st Army Arrives in Kunshan to Take Over Defense</p>
<p>Since the 71st Army of the National Army has been stationed in Kunshan, the military and civilians have had a harmonious relationship. Now, upon orders, they are moving to Suzhou. On the morning of the 7th, officers led their respective units and soldiers, and marched along the highway to Suzhou. The 21st Army, which came to Kunshan to take over the defense, also arrived in Kunshan by train from Danyang at 3:30 p.m. on the 7th, led by Chief of Staff Major General Li Qianrong with all officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Grain Stocks Are Not Abundant</p>
<p>Wuxi is a major grain center in Jiangsu Province. Produce from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces are transported to Wuxi for distribution. Fluctuations in the local market price can affect other regions. Grain prices rose at the end of last year, and since the new year, the market trend has been upward, and it is feared that prices will not fall. This is because the existing reserves in Jin County are not abundant. At the end of last year, apart from some merchants having some stocks, the amount of inventory was significantly different compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: Jiangsu Province Abolishes County Loan Measures</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province has suffered devastation from the enemy and puppet regime, and the finances of various counties have reached a critical point. Moreover, due to the financial restructuring by the provincial government, the provincial treasury has no revenue to allocate, and subsidies from the central government are slow to arrive. In the midst of despair, temporary loan measures were provisionally stipulated and promulgated to various counties and cities. This was entirely a temporary expedient. After various counties and cities followed the measures, they often faced difficulties in finding loan targets and obtaining loans easily. Therefore, if execution is not careful, it will degenerate into factionalism, which is easily criticized by society. The provincial government, aware of this, has, while ordering various counties and cities to earnestly reorganize reasonable taxes and thoroughly clear public funds and public property, also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to quickly allocate subsidies. So far, only 60 million yuan has been allocated, which, when distributed among the 63 counties and cities, is a drop in the bucket and far from meeting actual needs. The provincial government specially sent Finance Director Dong Che to Nanjing the other day to negotiate urgently with the Ministry of Finance. Before the allocation of funds to various localities is finalized, they requested a monthly loan of at least 400 million yuan to enrich the finances of the counties and cities. It is said that the Ministry of Finance authorities have agreed, and the provincial government has decided that once the funds are allocated, they will be immediately distributed to various counties, and the previously established temporary loan measures will be abolished, and further borrowing will be strictly prohibited. At the same time, a detailed investigation will be conducted into the items and amounts of past loans in various counties and cities, so that debts can be repaid in installments when the county treasuries are replenished.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Establishes Relief Stations</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong, considering that the people of various counties in northern Jiangsu, left behind after the calamities, are displaced and homeless, has previously allocated funds to order the Winter Relief Association to organize relief efforts in Xuzhou, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang. Chairman Wang, in view of the increasing numbers of refugees gathered in Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Haizhou, and Nantong, crying out for food, has specially sent a letter to Director Lu Yuke of the Jiangsu-Ning Relief Branch, earnestly pleading for the establishment of relief branch stations in Yangzhou, Haizhou, Xuzhou, and Nantong, transporting large quantities of food, clothing, and medicine for distribution, so that the refugees can barely survive.</p>

<h3 id="e44">A Great Project in a World of Utmost Happiness: The Mystery of the American Grand Dam: A Profound Impression After Inspecting TVA: Special Dispatch by Air: Professor Hu Huanyong, from New York <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>With the assistance of the U.S. government, our country has already begun planning the world's largest Yangtze River water conservancy project, the details of which were previously published on page 3 of this newspaper on the 27th of last month. This time, Professor Hu of Central University sent this article from the U.S., introducing the detailed content of TVA. We are publishing it urgently for the reference of our countrymen. Professor Hu is a leading geography expert in the country. Since being sent to the United States to study in October of last year, he has deeply researched geography and geographical education, and his gains have been particularly rich, all of which came from on-site inspections and are worth broadcasting to the country. (Editor)</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Creation: TVA, a Paradise on Earth</p>
<p>At the end of December last year, the Association of American Geographers held a meeting in Knoxville, Tennessee, in the southern United States. I was invited to participate, taking the opportunity to meet most of the American geographers, and to raise the issue of China's population for discussion with American experts. What was especially rare was the on-site inspection of TVA. The so-called regional design and regional development, TVA has become a world-renowned paradise. The full name of TVA, translated into Chinese, is the "Tennessee Valley Authority." It was established in 1933 by former U.S. President Roosevelt and is one of the important facilities for developing localities under his New Deal. After only twelve years, it has already achieved great success, benefiting the country and society. The so-called ideal country, the so-called Utopia, has indeed become a reality here.</p>
<p>The Tennessee River is a tributary of the Ohio River, which is a tributary of the Mississippi River. It is 1,000 kilometers long and flows through seven states, with a drainage area of 100,000 square kilometers, about the size of Zhejiang Province in our country. The total population of the entire area is only 4.5 million, only a quarter of the population of Zhejiang Province. The valley is mostly mountainous, and the rainfall is also very heavy, about 1,300 mm per year. Therefore, not only is the soil easily eroded by rain, but there are also frequent floods. In the past, the local economy was very poor.</p>
<p>Nine Major Dams on the Main Stream, Thirteen Dams Built on Tributaries</p>
<p>What is the Tennessee River Valley like now? Nine large dams have been built on the main stream and thirteen dams have been built on the tributaries, for a total of twenty-two dams. These dams (1) control floods. Now, not only is the Tennessee River no longer plagued by floods, but the floods on the Mississippi River have also been greatly reduced. (2) They facilitate navigation. Each dam on the main stream is equipped with a ship lock. Although the water levels upstream and downstream are different, ships with a draft of nine feet can pass all year round. The water level difference between the upper and lower reaches of the Tennessee River is 500 feet. Without ship lock facilities, navigation would be almost impossible. (3) They generate electricity. This is the core work of TVA. Currently, the power generation capacity of all dams in the area is 2.5 million kilowatts, which, together with thermal power generation, totals 3.2 million kilowatts. Last year, a total of 32 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity was generated. Each kilowatt-hour is equivalent to ten hours of work for one person. The annual electricity in this area is equivalent to the work efficiency of ten million people.</p>
<p>Atomic Bomb Factory: TVA Supplies Electricity</p>
<p>About 60% of this electricity is used for factories. The most important of these are the atomic bomb factory, the American Aluminum Company, and other metal factories. These are the most important national defense industries during the war, and also the important facilities that determined the outcome of this war. In addition, fertilizer plants are the most important foundation for improving agriculture inside and outside the area. Currently, there are about 600,000 electricity users inside and outside the area. This is an important hub for rural electrification. The average electricity price is only a little over one cent per kilowatt-hour. Electricity consumption by the public is organized through cooperative associations.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, TVA has used a total of 700 million U.S. dollars from the national treasury, of which about 65% was used for power generation equipment. Now, the annual revenue from electricity sales is 40 million U.S. dollars. After deducting 20 million U.S. dollars in expenses, the net surplus is 20 million U.S. dollars. It is estimated that the entire start-up costs can be fully repaid within thirty years, while the power generation equipment will still exist. The above is an introduction to the general situation of TVA.</p>
<p>According to the above, it seems that the spirit of TVA is water conservancy, electricity, and economy, but in reality, it is not so simple. TVA does things in the form of a company, not a government office. However, TVA's work is connected to and cooperated with all departments of the federal government, as well as state governments and township offices, with a thousand strands, meeting needs from all directions. This is truly the highest expression of the American democratic spirit.</p>
<p>Secondly, TVA's work is not only about flood control, power generation, and fertilizer production. There is also educational work, research work, health work, and even tourism management, with a wide variety of activities, everything is available.</p>
<p>The highest administrative body of TVA is a board of three directors, appointed by the U.S. President. Internally, the appointment and administration of personnel is completely free, but the administrative policy is determined by Congress, and a work report is submitted to Congress every year. Its connection with other agencies is based on contractual relationships, and it is not constrained by any party, nor does it infringe on the authority of any party.</p>
<p>American Democratic Spirit: TVA's Utmost Expression</p>
<p>From this point of view, TVA is not only an engineering technology or commercial economic organization, but also a political organization and social institution. In the past, it was an experimental site for local development, but now it has become a paradise on earth. It is said that in the past ten years, more than ten million people from all over the world have come to visit.</p>
<p>We in China are now about to begin building YVA, building the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River. In terms of scale, it is even greater than TVA. The situation of our Yellow River is similar to that of the Tennessee River in the past, but the disasters are even more severe than those of the Tennessee River. When will our HVA begin to be organized?</p>
<p>When we learn from TVA, we not only learn from its engineering technology, hydropower economy, but more importantly, we learn from their working spirit and cooperative spirit. It is said that there are particularly many compatriots from China who visit TVA. We hope that the achievements and spirit of TVA can be effectively realized in China. I am still abroad, but I have boundless expectations for our YVA, HVA, and even the entire China. China has very good opportunities in terms of climate and geography. What is lacking is harmony. As long as people do their best and make the most of the land, TVA's operation is our best example. I hope we can all work hard. (Broadcast manuscript to the country)</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Your newspaper has repeatedly published articles disclosing the true situation in northern Jiangsu. It is fortunate that there is still such a newspaper in Shanghai that has not forgotten our fellow countrymen in the corner of northern Jiangsu. We are sincerely grateful. To be honest, what we see in Shanghai, in newspapers and magazines, regarding the so-called "Liberated Areas" are all works by writers who ignore the facts and write with their eyes closed. Especially in one or two magazines, they often portray the so-called "Liberated Areas" as being incredibly advanced, saying that the cornerstone of true democracy has been laid there, and that the army there is truly the people's armed force. When we see these propagandistic (the authors of course say they are factual) articles, we can only swallow our anger. Because they are directly praising the "Liberated Areas," indirectly implying that we, the thousands upon thousands of people who have fled from the "Liberated Areas," are crazy and deserve to starve and freeze. Alas! These writers, opening their mouths, all say they are speaking for the people, taking it as their responsibility. Why do they produce such deceptive texts? Is this the expression of freedom of speech? I don't need to say more about the true situation in the "Liberated Areas" here. In Shanghai, because it is relatively isolated from northern Jiangsu, and the standard of living is higher than in other places, there are still few refugees who have fled here, and it is not easy to see the true situation of the refugees. However, I only hope that these writers will go to Zhenjiang and Yangzhou to take a look. There are countless refugees there, old and young, men and women, wandering the streets, with no fixed abode or food, and receiving no comfort at the same time. Why are they willing to stay in this "unfree, undemocratic" circle and suffer, rather than go to the "democratic and free" "Liberated Areas" to live a stable life? I think, in the eyes of these writers, those who do not know will be called "stubborn," and they will certainly say that they are "anti-democratic special agents" who have been ordered to come and damage the reputation of the "Liberated Areas." I am extremely angry and will not say more. Sincerely, Reader Wang Zhun (February 4)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e47">Hopes for the Future of Politics <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>For the past eight or nine years, the entire nation's soldiers and civilians have shed sweat and blood, swallowing tears and suppressing grief in pursuit of driving out the Japanese invaders and, after their expulsion, building a prosperous and happy new China. We want to safeguard the country, we want to protect the rights of the people, and we want to raise the people's living standards. Now that the enemy has surrendered, our goal of nation-building still seems to be within reach, yet still unattainable. Regarding international relations, although world peace is highly probable, covert and overt struggles are inevitable, leaving no room for naive optimism. Domestically, while the danger of internal strife has largely passed, disturbances in various regions have not completely ended. Furthermore, with skyrocketing prices and production stagnation, the general middle class is rapidly going bankrupt, leading to disappointment and even resentment replacing the joy of victory in people's hearts. The Political Consultative Conference and the United Nations Conference seemed to offer hope to the people. However, after these two conferences, neither the international situation nor China has shown any new signs of improvement. The situation is indeed changing. However, whether it is truly changing for the better is still too early to say.</p>
<p>The people of the whole country hope for things to change for the better. We only allow things to change for the better, not for the worse. But at the moment, the tendency for things to improve is no greater than the tendency for things to worsen. What is the reason for this? To be honest, those in power in politics today certainly intend to do good, or are also working hard to do good, but unfortunately, influential figures and groups seem to prioritize the planning of competing for power over the planning for the country. Although Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is loudly calling for politics to be a responsibility rather than a right, those who can truly understand and practice this are few and far between!</p>
<p>Politics, of course, cannot do without the struggle for power. But the struggle for power is a means, and planning for the country is the goal. To struggle for power for the sake of planning for the country, the struggle must be aboveboard. If one does not consider the interests of the country and the people, then the struggle for power is no different from seizing profits! What is valuable about a statesman is their ability to have foresight and plan for the country for thousands and millions of generations. Therefore, a statesman must worry about the worries of the world before worrying about his own, and rejoice in the joy of the world after rejoicing in his own. So-called "realism" is truly a political trap. Planning solely for immediate power and interests can easily turn one into a fool. To reiterate, politics cannot do without the struggle for power. But to struggle for power by any means necessary, to struggle for power with short-sightedness and quick gains, is no different from the speculative practices of a profiteer! We should at least offer one hope to all powerful parties in politics today, which is that their intelligence and wisdom should not only be used to seek temporary convenience based on reality but must be used to make precise arrangements for the permanent future of the country and nation.</p>
<p>Since the victory of the War of Resistance, our country's international standing has suffered increasing damage and continues to suffer manipulation. We not only have no voice in international affairs, but our own security is also not guaranteed. Moreover, we are almost losing our voice even on matters concerning our own country. Our recognition of Mongolia's independence originally had the tragic grandeur of a brave warrior cutting off his wrist. However, Northeast China and Xinjiang have remained in confusion. Overseas, news of the abuse and persecution of overseas Chinese in various places is constantly reported, and even French Indochina Vietnam is trying to bully the Chinese. What is the reason for this? To be honest, people must insult themselves before others insult them. Our discord and incompetence have caused the international status gained through eight years of bloody battles to be in danger of being lost before the bones of the dead have even been buried. The reason why the powerful factions in our politics are discordant and incompetent is that many of them regard political means as an end and are intoxicated with realism. Therefore, they are indifferent not only to the situation in Northeast China and the plight of overseas Chinese but even regard this as a good opportunity for political activity. The greatest source of disaster today is realism! All forms of factionalism, bureaucracy, and opportunism are variants of it!</p>
<p>We must awaken from realism and face the problems of the country squarely!</p>
<p>In today's era of international life, the politicians of a country—if they deserve to be called politicians—must first consider the country's position and policies in the world. Our country is nominally one of the four or five great powers. But let's be frank, is that really the case? Nevertheless, we must strive for strength. The most important thing for everyone, especially those engaged in political movements, is to make the country a truly strong country. We must not be intoxicated with the fine name of "four or five great powers," nor should we be deceived by the ideal of "peace" and think that there is no need to strive for strength.</p>
<p>We should know that competing for political power internally is one thing, and competing for national rights externally is another. If we do not compete for national rights externally, then at the very least, we should warn each other never to use foreign forces as tools for political struggle. We must understand that although China's environment is not as bad as that of the Middle East, if we do not make a painful decision to solve our own problems ourselves and never use foreign forces as tools for solving internal affairs, then we will inevitably be reduced to puppets on the international stage, like the countries of the Middle East! However, everyone is very enthusiastic about internal affairs, but they are very calm and silent about the rights and honor of the country!</p>
<p>Secondly, in today's industrial era, industry and commerce are the lifeblood of the country. After the victory, everyone was busy fighting for power and taking over. No one asked about how to produce. Taking Shanghai as an example, 90% of the industry has been at a standstill for the past five months! Even many shops still have "Iron Generals" guarding the doors! No wonder prices are soaring! If we do not actively restore production and transportation, we will inevitably drive capital to speculation and hoarding. The day when there is no opportunity to speculate will be the day when the whole country becomes beggars! In the face of such a bankruptcy crisis, in addition to restoring order and transportation, on the one hand, we must remove obstacles to industrial and commercial enterprises, and on the other hand, we must support the progress of production enterprises. This includes the elimination of corruption, the reform of the tax system, the determination of exchange rates, the support of international trade, and the encouragement of various government loans and underwriting measures. Most importantly, the government must establish a policy of not interfering with legitimate industry and commerce and must provide all conveniences. However, the government has not yet taken any measures, and the various parties have not truly paid attention, or even consider the bankruptcy of the national economy as an opportunity for political attack.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the last few years of the War of Resistance, political discipline and social morality declined. One of the biggest reasons is that the treatment of public educators is simply unreasonable. Those who are loyal to their duties and abide by the law cannot maintain a healthy and self-respecting life according to the law, which is tantamount to forcing or tempting everyone to take the wrong path. This is not only a problem of the lives and morals of a small number of people. The destruction of the physical and mental health of the country's intellectuals will lead to political and cultural bankruptcy. In fact, everyone has to live. Rather than having everyone survive by unofficial means, why not raise their salaries and strictly prohibit illegal income? However, everyone does not seem to take this problem very seriously.</p>
<p>Finally, a country must be unified, and it must be democratic. Today, China seems to have only people who use unity and democracy as political slogans but do not realize that unity and democracy are the fundamental conditions for establishing a country, and that the two are one and not two. A country that is not unified is not a country at all. We do not agree that warlord politics is a good thing, but it is another thing that the unity gained at a heavy price must be maintained. Today, those in power must fully understand that unity must be achieved through democracy and freedom, while those in the opposition must also know that today, to use so-called "autonomy" to oppose unity and repeat the trick of "federated provinces" is just a bad political plot. Today, everyone supports democracy, which is a very good thing. However, there is no doubt that some people use democracy as a disguise, while others only use democracy as a weapon. In other words, they are not democratic themselves, but they only demand democracy from others. Little do they know that the most democratic will definitely be the last to succeed, and there is no need to criticize others for one's own shortcomings. The reason for this is that everyone lacks confidence in democracy, which is also the fundamental crisis of the country.</p>
<p>In fact, whether it is unity or democracy, we must implement four things: First, we must not use force as a tool for political struggle, that is, the so-called nationalization of the military. But because of our outdated vision, we always believe in force. Even today, we still cannot see clearly and give up the universal awareness of using force to fight for power. Therefore, we are still bargaining over this issue, and the losses to the country and the suffering of the people are beyond calculation and not in their minds. Second, we must ensure the basic rights and freedoms of the people. Without the rights and freedoms of the people, the country will not be unified. Third, so-called democracy must be carried out through elections so that the people can choose their ideal government with their free will. Fourth, democratic politics is indeed party politics, but the reason why democratic politics is worthy of support is that the democratic method makes it easier for talents to emerge.</p>
<p>In short, we believe that the major issues facing the country are:</p>
<p>We must ensure the integrity of territorial sovereignty.</p>
<p>We must protect industry and commerce.</p>
<p>We must protect the rights and freedoms of the people.</p>
<p>We must protect the lives of public educators.</p>
<p>We must not use foreign forces or force as a tool for political struggle, and then establish a government through free and universal suffrage.</p>
<p>We must establish a unified government of talent from all over the country.</p>
<p>These are the several major goals at present. However, the Political Consultative Conference failed to truly solve these demands of the people. It is not that the Political Consultative Conference does not have the power to solve them, but that it is not interested in them at all. To be more honest, they are all too realistic. They only pay attention to how to divide the rights of the parties, but they never pay attention to the reception in the Northeast and the problems of the overseas Chinese, nor have they put forward an emergency relief plan for the bankruptcy of industry and commerce. What is even more worrying is that they all ignore the long-term problems of the country for the sake of temporary expediency. For example, regarding the draft constitution, the May 5th Constitution is not entirely satisfactory, and the provincial autonomy advocated by the conference will inevitably lead the country to local separatism before the military is completely nationalized. What is especially disappointing is that the various parties only use the party as the standard for talent. In the past, it was said that there were no poor people in the upper class and no noble people in the lower class. Today, we seem to have a kind of party "caste" too! If this continues, five people in a party and three people in a faction can turn mediocrity into talent!</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference did not fail to achieve anything. It has opened a door for negotiation to resolve unspecified internal strife, and it has opened a road for free competition in Chinese politics. As for practical achievements and major plans for establishing and stabilizing the country, the people themselves must work hard.</p>
<p>Today is the period from political tutelage to constitutional government. The Kuomintang's political tutelage did not complete the establishment of the country. The Political Consultative Conference has also failed to provide us with security and happiness. If the future National Assembly is only an enlarged Consultative Conference, we are really worried. The Political Consultative Conference represents the existing forces in China, and these forces are only hindering each other for the sake of fighting for political power. Therefore, China needs a new force. This new force must represent the force of thorough democracy and freedom to urge everyone to carry out the cause of national construction, so that Chinese politics can have vitality. Who is the newest force? Farmers, workers, teachers, industrialists, businessmen, and freelancers. Is it necessary to establish a party? No, non-party and non-faction, regardless of party affiliation. What method to use? Use the power of public opinion to urge the various forces in politics to follow the right path of democratic constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Whether Chinese politics can quickly get on track depends on whether the people who truly love freedom in China can unite and launch a powerful movement!</p>

<h3 id="e48">Outstanding Meritorious Service of American Generals Madame Chiang Kai-shek Presides Over Conferment of Medals Madame Expresses Deep Pleasure at Returning to Hometown of Politics <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>If someone were to ask me about the most solemn and harmonious medal conferment ceremony in this city after the victory, I would tell them directly that it was the medal conferment ceremony held by Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, on behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, at the mayor's office in the Municipal Government yesterday. Such a scene may be common in the wartime capital, but in Shanghai, which has been occupied for eight years, it is still the first time.</p>
<p>Ceremony Begins</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM, Mayor Qian's exquisite semicircular office suddenly became lively. Fifteen minutes later, Madame Chiang Kai-shek and General Chen Cheng, along with Madam Tan Xiang, gracefully appeared. The eyes of the entire room involuntarily converged on them. Madame Chiang Kai-shek was wearing a dark black long-sleeved cheongsam, inlaid with sapphire blue trim, black high heels, and a face full of smiles. Madame Chen wore a crimson cheongsam and always followed closely behind Madame Chiang Kai-shek. At this time, General Wedemeyer also arrived, standing to the right of Madame Chiang Kai-shek. The medal conferment ceremony officially began.</p>
<p>Reading of Citations</p>
<p>The four American generals to be awarded medals were General Stratemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces in China, who is returning home today; Brigadier General McNarney, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Air Forces in China; Brigadier General Evans, Deputy Chief of Staff; and Brigadier General Ruteledge. Their uniforms were neatly pressed, and their left chests were already covered with decorations. They stood in an orderly row under the portrait of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, displaying redoubled spirit. On both sides were bright Party and national flags. First, General Huang Renlin read the citations in Chinese and English, stating that General Stratemeyer had made contributions to defeating the enemy, the cooperation between the Chinese and American air forces, and the training of the Chinese air force while serving as Commander of the Air Force in the China-India-Burma Theater and Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces in China, and should be awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Cloud and Banner and the Air Force Hutu Medal… Brigadier General McNarney was also awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Cloud and Banner and the Air Force Luoshu Medal for assisting General Stratemeyer… Brigadier Generals Evans and Ruteledge were also awarded the Order of the Cloud and Banner and the Air Force Qian Yuan Medal for their meritorious service… In addition, Major General Claire Chennault, former Commander of the U.S. 14th Air Force, also received the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Cloud and Banner and the Air Force Medal. Since Major General Chennault has already returned to the United States, this medal will be accepted and forwarded by General Wedemeyer.</p>
<p>Medal Conferment</p>
<p>After each citation was read, one of the generals would step in front of Madame Chiang Kai-shek in a perfect salute. Madame Chiang Kai-shek personally took the medal and pinned it on the recipient's left lapel, then draped the Grand Cordon over their shoulders. At this time, the flashes of the photographers' cameras were incessant, and the sound of the shutters was endless. Madame Chiang Kai-shek shook hands with the recipient and said "Congratulations." The recipient nodded and thanked her, returning to his original position with a smile of honor. A solemn and colorful scene was completed in a short 20 minutes. Also attending the ceremony yesterday were Zhou Zhirou, Chairman of the Aviation Commission; Qian Dajun, Mayor; He Dekui, Deputy Mayor; Shen Shihua, Secretary-General; Li Jilan, Deputy Commander of the Garrison Command; Xuan Tiewu, Police Chief; and Mei Qiju, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Battlefield Service Corps.</p>
<p>Generals Sign</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Madame Chiang Kai-shek raised a glass of wine to congratulate the awarded generals. Then she spoke with General Wedemeyer for ten minutes, constantly nodding and smiling, showing that she was in a very happy mood. The faces of the American generals who received the awards, which were serious and tense a moment ago, were now overflowing with lighthearted smiles, a smile that contained honor and satisfaction. Reporters seized the precious moment, approached the generals, offered congratulations, and asked them to leave a commemorative signature for the newspaper, which they signed without hesitation.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Speaks</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked Madame Chiang Kai-shek to say a few words. She smiled again and said that this was her first time in Shanghai after the victory. Shanghai was originally her hometown, and she felt infinitely excited and happy to set foot on her native soil again and see the people of Shanghai. There was really nothing else to say. Yes, Madame Chiang Kai-shek had been away from Shanghai for eight years. Her deep joy upon her return was such that she was speechless. This joy symbolizes the future of Shanghai, and the people of Shanghai will soon experience the warmth of this joy.</p>

<p>Since Madame Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Shanghai, reporters from various newspapers have visited her to seek an audience, but she has been unable to find time to meet with them due to her busy schedule. It is now learned that Madame Chiang Kai-shek will hold a press conference in Shanghai in the coming days to meet and talk with reporters from various newspapers in the city.</p>

<p>Shanghai Enterprise Company leased the China Merchants Bureau's No. 109 motorized junk (formerly known as Beiwu) last year, sailing the Qingdao line. It departed from Shanghai on January 14, carrying goods to Qingdao. According to the voyage, it would have arrived in a maximum of five days, but it has been a month and there is no news. The ship has no wireless equipment, so communication is difficult. The company and passengers are extremely anxious. The ship has a deadweight tonnage of 197 tons and a crew of 15 people. This time, it carried 4,150 bags of flour, 500 bags of rice, and about 130 tons of miscellaneous goods. The above rice and flour were loaded by Jinjiangtai Reporting Office, and three people were sent to escort the ship. Last Tuesday, someone from Bailonggang, Pudong, suddenly reported to Jinjiangtai that five corpses of men had been recovered from a junk in the Zhoushan waters. A card was found in the body of one of the corpses, as well as the agency's introduction to board the ship as an escort, named Zhang Minyun. All the bodies have now been transported to Sijiao near Zhoushan. The firm confirmed that Zhang Minyun was indeed sent to escort the ship, so the ship's loss has been confirmed. They immediately informed Shanghai Enterprise Company, who reported to the China Merchants Bureau and immediately sent people to Sijiao to identify the bodies and investigate the shipwreck.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Strict Prohibition of Hoarding Grain Guild Deliberates on Measures <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>In response to the recent rise in rice prices, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Shop Industry Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 5:00 PM on the 9th, with the participation of Yang Xizhi, special commissioner of the Grain Administration. The directors and supervisors reviewed and explained the reasons for the rise in rice prices: (1) Rice prices have been very stable for several months, but have recently been severely stimulated by the price of gold and other commodities. (2) Fewer goods arrived before the Lunar New Year, and people are optimistic. (3) The organizational foundation of the Rice Industry Association is weak during the recovery period, and unscrupulous individuals who have been popular in recent years inevitably take the opportunity to raise prices. (4) Speculators inevitably buy and hoard at high prices. After deliberation, the following was decided: (1) Strengthen the organization and management of the rice market; non-rice merchants are not allowed to trade. (2) Advise colleagues not to raise prices and to report each other. (3) Effectively prevent non-members from buying, and members are responsible for reporting speculators and requesting the authorities to punish them. (4) Hope that the authorities will generally stabilize prices. (5) Request the Grain Administration to continue selling rice, which will be handled by the association. However, the price should not be too low to avoid purchase. Yang said that he will work with the military and police authorities to inspect warehouses, strictly prohibit speculation and hoarding, and consider entrusting the association to continue selling rice in the market at prices slightly lower than the market price to regulate the people's food, replenish the grain source, and stabilize the rice price. It is not a low-price sale, because it is difficult to seek fairness in distribution and only benefits a small number of people.</p>

<p>[Our Report] General Zhou Zhi-rou, Chairman of the Aviation Committee, met with our reporter at the Cathay Hotel yesterday to discuss the general situation regarding the establishment of China's new air force. Zhou stated that to have a strong air force, there must be well-trained basic personnel. Currently, there are still over 2,000 Chinese air force trainees undergoing training in the United States, and personnel will continue to be sent in the future. At the same time, the Air Force Academies in various parts of the rear will also enrich their content. The one formerly in Lahore, India, has been successively moved back to the country by sea and air. The Hangzhou Jianqiao Air Force Academy is likely to reopen before the end of May this year. As for the trainees in the United States, part of the expenses are paid by the United States in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act. Zhou continued that since the surrender of Japan, China has received approximately 800 Japanese aircraft (excluding the Northeast), including dive bombers, fighters, reconnaissance planes, transport planes, and trainers.

<p>The "Educational Loan" jointly organized by this newspaper and the Shanghai Educational Loan Committee has seen a very enthusiastic response from impoverished students in major universities and schools since applications began on the 4th. Statistics show that the number of applicants has exceeded 7,000. The original deadline was yesterday, but because some students were still returning from their hometowns for the Lunar New Year holiday and are rushing back, many have sent letters requesting an extension. After discussion among the responsible personnel in the committee, a grace period of two more days has been granted, meaning applications can still be submitted today and tomorrow. No further grace periods will be granted. Among the more than 2,500 students who received assistance from this newspaper last year, a small number have not yet applied. Unless their families' financial situation has improved or their academic performance is poor, it is hoped that they will come and pick up the forms quickly and not give up the opportunity to receive assistance. Also, applying students should submit their completed application forms to the principal for endorsement and then submit them to the committee as soon as possible. The deadlines are before the 13th for university and college students, before the 15th for senior and junior high school students, and before the 17th for primary school students. All must be submitted on time for review. As the start of the school term is fast approaching, it is hoped that the principals of each school will be responsible for expediting the process so that the committee can complete the necessary procedures early, including reviewing the applications and sending personnel to investigate family situations, so that impoverished students will not suffer the pain of being unable to attend school.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Supply and Demand of Yarn and Cloth Mismatched - Hope that Textile Construction Increases Sales Volume <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(Our Report) The market price of yarn and cloth has been rising sharply recently. The listed price of the China Textile Construction Corporation has also been rising steadily in each phase. For example, 42-count yarn was over 900,000 yuan at the end of January, and 20-count yarn was 550,000 yuan. But by February 10, 42-count had opened at 1.43 million yuan and 20-count at 820,000 yuan. From February 1 to 10, the company announced public prices four times. Although the price of 20-count yarn remained steady at 680,000 yuan for three phases, the quality of the first phase was Blue Phoenix, the second phase was Yueqin, and the third phase was reduced to [missing name] Girl and unbranded, which has invisibly raised prices. Compared with the Lunar New Year, it has risen by about 30-40%. All parties are quite concerned about this. According to Mr. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, this situation is entirely due to the mismatch between supply and demand. Most yarn and cloth manufacturers have already accepted orders at the end of the Lunar New Year. For general white cloth weaving factories, they have been too busy recently to deliver orders and have no way to supply spot sales. However, the Textile Construction Corporation has not released any cloth since the red opening. Dyeing factories have sold orders before the year, so they have to purchase white cloth on the market in order to dye and deliver goods. As a result, the supply is not balanced, and the market price has risen. Moreover, customer groups have received telegrams from the mainland, saying that people have been lacking clothing for a long time and are urging to catch up on the supply of yarn and cloth. The market price is even more difficult to stabilize. Because most dyeing and weaving factories have sold orders before the Lunar New Year, they have suffered a lot of losses. If the Textile Construction Corporation does not sell white cloth again, the factories and customer groups will feel even more difficult. Mr. Pan also pointed out that the Minrong Dyeing and Weaving Factory in this city has about 10,000 looms, most of which were preparing to start work during the Lunar New Year. Recently, the Textile Construction Corporation has released yarn in each phase, but the number is not large, so the factories hope that it can increase the number of sales so that they can start work. White cloth factories urged to stop work for three days during the Lunar New Year. They are now rushing to ship goods to the market to avoid causing another disturbance in the market. If state-owned yarn and cloth factories can increase their supply and pay attention to the yarn and thread of private industries and the original price, they can gradually recover. It is also heard that since the Textile Construction Corporation handled the registration of yarn and cloth manufacturers, the association has been forwarding the member registration cards to the company on a daily basis and has also sent a letter requesting to open sales of white cloth to meet urgent needs. However, according to news revealed by the Textile Construction Corporation, because the government needs military fabrics, it may not be able to supply a large amount for civilian use for a while. It is found that the cloth factories taken over by the Textile Construction Corporation can produce about 5,000 pieces of cloth per day. According to its production capacity, it can be increased to tens of thousands of pieces per day.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Silk Boom <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Silk has been booming since the market opened on Wednesday, rising in a straight line. The spot price of 120 artificial silk at Tianqiao has risen by a total of 500,000 yuan in four days, but the actual transactions are few. Although there is a move to pay supplementary taxes on warehouse receipts, transactions are frequent and unwilling to show weakness. By the weekend, it had risen to more than 300,000 yuan. Factory-business transactions, foreign firms and factory sales are all available. The selling price follows the gold market and has risen by about 200,000 yuan in each stall. Dacheng Gebi Crepe, a silk fabric, is currently on sale and is the most popular. Compared with the opening red plate and the weekend price, it has risen by more than 29%. Lin Ji's Wax Wing Gauze and Huajin Crepe are also rising sharply, reaching 40% and 30% respectively. Meiya bedsheets have risen by 150,000 yuan per hundred, and Minsheng brocade has risen by 2,000 yuan per piece. Yesterday, Sunday, the silk market was closed as usual, although there were no transactions, the silk fabric market was quite lively, people's hearts were inspired, and the buying intention was strong. Meiya bedsheets are calling 1.05 million yuan per hundred, and Dacheng Gebi Crepe is calling 4,480 yuan per yard. Looking forward to the future of the silk market price, it seems to have a tendency to move forward.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Tinplate Shows Its Edge <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Recently, various colors of tinplate have been selling very well, and the market price has been rising sharply, rising by as much as 30-40% compared to half a month ago. For example, 180-pound double-linked iron is currently calling 140,000 yuan per box, 90-pound single-linked iron is 75,000 yuan per box, and 200-pound Hui Si iron is 100,000 yuan per box, which has already been made, and is currently calling 120,000 yuan. One-inch to three-inch narrow strip iron sells for 75,000 yuan per box, and four-inch to eight-inch wide strip iron mixed goods sell for 90,000 yuan per box. The market for 24-gauge tinplate is relatively stable, with each sheet trading at 8,000 yuan. 26-gauge tinplate is calling about 250,000 yuan per box. 112-pound kerosene box blanks are calling as high as 60,000 yuan per box, a sharp increase of nearly double compared to two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Mr. J.T.S. Reed, General Manager of Citibank's Shanghai Branch, made the following remarks to reporters yesterday.</p>
<p>In this city, US dollars printed with the word "Hawaii" are generally recognized to be of lower value than other US dollars. In order to correct the above misconception, the bank (No. 41 Jiujiang Road in this city) has specifically decided to exchange all US dollars printed with the word "Hawaii" for US dollars without the word "Hawaii" at the same price, starting today (i.e. Monday). The purpose of this move by the bank is to safeguard public interests, because the public has mistakenly believed the rumors of speculators, obviously believing that US dollars printed with the word "Hawaii" are not as welcome as ordinary banknotes in the United States. However, the fact is not so, so the bank has specially implemented this exchange method, so that all sectors can understand that US dollars printed with the word "Hawaii" and US dollars without the word are equally supported by the government of the United States and are in the same status.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Current Labor Issues <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Lu</p>
<p>In the current industrial world, labor issues are quite serious, and this is true not only in China but also in the United States.</p>
<p>In the United States, the first issue encountered after victory was the labor issue. After the working hours of laborers were restored from 48 hours per week to 40 hours, their income also decreased accordingly. The employers sternly rejected the demand for wage increases. President Truman convened a national labor-management consultation conference in mid-November last year.</p>
<p>After the three-week labor-management consultation conference, the labor issue was not resolved. Currently, nearly two million workers in the United States have left their jobs due to labor-management disputes. This number is not large compared to the total number of laborers in the United States, but the trend of strikes has affected the American economy. More than 200,000 workers in the automobile industry are on strike, accounting for more than half of all workers. Other industries that have already gone on strike include the slaughtering industry, the timber industry, and the steel industry.</p>
<p>President Truman's most recent measure is to conduct a factual investigation in order to use the power of public opinion to solve the problem. However, this measure cannot win the sympathy of both labor and management. From the labor side, because they cannot strike or stop work within the 30 days of the investigation, they lose a weapon; from the management side, they are unwilling to disclose their [missing word] books.</p>
<p>In fact, this kind of mutual suspicion is the biggest reason that hinders cooperation between labor and management. In fact, the management cannot do without the laborers, and the laborers cannot do without the management. What the management hopes is to obtain legitimate profits, and what the laborers hope is to enjoy a stable life. Both sides should absolutely discuss calmly and reasonably, and find ways to cope with the difficulties of the environment.</p>
<p>China's industry urgently needs to be built after victory. Even if there is no delay and no obstruction, it is already very difficult to catch up with the advanced countries. Therefore, it is absolutely not allowed to lose valuable opportunities because of labor issues. Therefore, China's labor issues must be resolved rationally. The most rational method is for labor and management to have no barriers, be frank and straightforward, and based on facts, formulate mutually beneficial measures that are beneficial to both labor and management and the future of the business.</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Revitalization Efforts of the Ford Motor Company <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Qing He</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of enterprise, continuous effort is necessary to maintain its existing position. People in our country generally acknowledge that starting a business is difficult, but maintaining it is also not easy. Recently, Henry Ford, the founder of the American Ford Motor Company, officially retired, and his grandson succeeded him. We can now pay attention to future developments. The young Ford has taken on the responsibility of revitalizing the Ford Motor Company. This situation differs from the inheritance methods of some business circles in our country.</p>
<p>Recently, in Detroit, the most discussed topics, besides labor issues, revolve around how Henry Ford II will succeed his grandfather in carrying forward the Ford Motor Company's business.</p>
<p>He is known locally as Young Henry or Henry II. He is currently undergoing a trial, meaning his talent will ultimately be judged. Under these circumstances, he has to demonstrate his abilities with facts. Several years ago, he was a quiet and cheerful young man with blue eyes and apple-red cheeks, without any particular characteristics standing out. He used to live a carefree and leisurely life, but since his father passed away in mid-August 1944, he has inherited his father's position, becoming the second-in-command in the Ford Company. His colleagues at Ford have a sense of sympathy for him, but not of fear, because he still needs to learn a lot about the automobile business.</p>
<p>During his first meeting with reporters, he admitted that he was very young and inexperienced. After accepting a position like a throne, he still frankly said that he had many things to learn. But in fact, he already has a considerable understanding of the automotive business.</p>
<p>The three most important issues for the Ford Motor Company are: (1) how to cope with the changing environment, (2) how to maintain its inherent strengths, and (3) how to maintain good relations with the press. In the past, Ford Company produced a large number of wartime vehicles, and their publicity gave the impression that Ford Company was always at the forefront. Regarding relations with the press, a reporter said several years ago that investigating Ford Company's activities was as difficult as interviewing in the Soviet Union. But in recent years, Ford Company's executives have answered all questions raised by the press without hesitation. The young Henry's current task is to promote that good relationship and implement their inherent policies. A characteristic of the Ford Motor Company is that Henry Ford made a lot of money soon after founding the company and bought out the shares of the other shareholders. The Ford family owns a large number of shares, making it a private, family-owned company. As long as the money earned can meet the interests of the shareholders, they are very satisfied, unlike other companies with a large number of shareholders, making it difficult to please everyone as a manager.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the Ford Company's business has been declining. During World War I, Ford Company's turnover accounted for 60% of the national automobile business. By World War II, its turnover accounted for less than 20% of the national business. Therefore, the Ford Motor Company will have used up all its surplus from previous years to pay interest to shareholders.</p>
<p>The young Ford is very capable in his work and has earned the praise of the old Ford, although he may not agree with everything he does. Since taking over, his first step has been to strengthen the sales department and to strive to link sales, manufacturing, and engineering departments together. His goal is to bring the Ford Motor Company back to the top spot. Undoubtedly, he has already taken on the heavy responsibility of revitalizing the Ford Motor Company.</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Past and Future of Knitwear <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Hongxun</p>
<p>Knitwear is one of the light industries, and it can also be said to be a necessity for everyone. It has only been a few decades since people in our country set up factories to weave themselves. Even considering sock factories, they are still very immature. In the past, people in our country advocated simplicity and mostly wore cloth clothes and socks. In the early years of the Republic of China, British-made Eagle Brand cotton socks came to China. At that time, there were only two colors, black and white. Initially, they were promoted in China because they were more comfortable than cloth socks and cheaper. The public began to wear them. Later, people in our country also established sock factories to imitate them, seeking small profits. However, due to a shortage of capital, they were simple and unable to produce in large quantities to compete with foreign goods. Later, the United States imported a kind of patterned socks for dumping in China. People in our country loved their beautiful patterns and they were very popular. At that time, I was working in the knitwear machinery service. Seeing such an outflow of rights and interests, I founded Kangfu Sock Factory in 1926, specializing in the manufacture of various patterned socks, selling them throughout the country. Although it could not compete with imported goods, it could still save some of the market. Before the Pacific War, a large number of wholesale and sales were also conducted in Nanyang, Africa and other places abroad.</p>
<p>Times are constantly improving, and the needs of all walks of life are increasing with each passing day. Ordinary cotton socks should be produced in large quantities. Due to changes in clothing, patterned socks have also gradually been noticed and widely used, even in remote areas. Therefore, for all kinds of products, in terms of material, the first requirement is to be sturdy. In terms of patterns, they must also be constantly updated. Of course, the color must be durable and not fade after washing. Only then can we talk about resisting foreign goods, regaining rights and interests, and promoting the goal of domestic products. To achieve the above-mentioned situation, it is necessary to have huge and abundant capital, sophisticated machinery, and cultivate specialized technical talents, self-weaving, self-dyeing, and self-dressing, responding to the trend of development, constantly improving, striving for perfection, large-scale production, and working hard to build. I ask myself that the ability of one factory is limited. I hope that the knitwear industry across the country will unite and work together. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, traffic was blocked everywhere. Now that the rivers and mountains have been restored, traffic is open everywhere. The future of light industry has greater development. The Japanese invaders have surrendered and are seeking peace. Domestic needs are still difficult to meet. Foreign trade will inevitably be completely abandoned. In the past, the Nanyang market was mostly controlled by the Japanese. Taking advantage of this great opportunity, we can engage in plundering. Therefore, the knitwear industry is indeed the best period for development in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Production News: Three-Wheeled Cars <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>American car manufacturer, Calay Davis, has finalized plans to manufacture three-wheeled cars and may begin manufacturing in California within six months. These cars weigh 1,000 pounds and come in several versions including four-cylinder, six-cylinder, and eight-cylinder. The four-cylinder version can travel forty miles per gallon of gasoline, with a normal speed of sixty-five miles per hour and a top speed of eighty miles per hour.</p>
<p>Cotton Picking Machine</p>
<p>The American International Harvester Company spent much time manufacturing a cotton picking machine, which was tested in a cotton field two miles from Clarkdale with great success. Each time the machine was driven through the cotton field, it picked 95% of the cotton. The remaining bits were unripe burrs. The cost of picking cotton by hand is forty dollars per bale; with the machine, the cost is only seven dollars and fifty cents.</p>
<p>Using machines to pick cotton can reduce the cost of American cotton and make it competitive in the international market.</p>
<p>Direct Mail Delivery of Food</p>
<p>The United States has recently begun using direct mail delivery to sell food, including flour products and vegetables. This method was used to obtain some food in Europe during the war. The number of farms in the United States is increasing rapidly, with 5,500 farms at the end of 1944 and an expected increase to 15,000 by 1950.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Worker Training Programs in the UK and the US <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Wen</p>
<p>In the process of post-war recovery and reconstruction, talent training is a matter of urgency. The British Ministry of Labour recently announced a government plan to remedy disruptions to careers during the war. Technical colleges and business schools across the country will provide returned men and women with three months of business management training. Trainees must have formally served in the military, merchant marine, defense work, or coal mines for at least one year, and be able to prove that their careers were interrupted by the war before the age of 21 or after less than two years of business operation. Trainees can receive subsidies when necessary.</p>
<p>In the United States, the development of worker education has become an important part of adult education. Worker education in the United States focuses on the study of group issues, including skills ranging from union administration to the study of social sciences, American labor history, and labor philosophy. Educational methods include all educational techniques, such as classroom lectures, discussions, broadcasts, recordings, performances, films, and dramas. In addition to classroom instruction, there are entertainment and cultural activities. Recently, there has also been leisure education and education on how to avoid dangers in life, as well as medical care.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Small Boards of Directors <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Dong</p>
<p>In general factories, the issue of talent is very deeply felt, especially mid-level talent. Senior employees certainly have innovative ideas and a spirit of progress, but no one can understand them and turn their ideals into reality. The reason for this is a lack of capable mid-level personnel.</p>
<p>In factories abroad, in order to enable employees with ambitions to contribute more to the factory, small boards of directors, or Junior Boards of Directors, are often established. Their mission is to study the actual situation and provide suggestions for the highest authorities to adopt. Small boards of directors are organized by senior employees who are relatively progressive and hardworking. This not only enhances the efficiency of mid-level employees but also cultivates many management talents. Previously, the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai also had a small board of directors, organized by young people.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers' boards of directors in China do not take on the responsibilities of a board of directors and are close to being nominal. In the future, if we want to develop industry, directors should truly act as directors. At the same time, the establishment of small boards of directors can also solve the current problem of talent shortage.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Important Departments in the Sewing Industry <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Liqun</p>
<p>The definition of the sewing industry is very broad: Any industrial product made from a whole piece of raw material, after cutting and sewing, is collectively referred to as the sewing industry, such as the underwear industry, suit industry, hat industry, shoe industry, handkerchief industry, leather products industry, etc. They not only occupy a necessity in life, but can also be converted into military industry during wartime. Therefore, the sewing industry can also be called a light industry for national defense.</p>
<p>In addition to paying attention to skills, the sewing industry also values the threads used for sewing. The main threads used in the sewing industry are wood yarn threads. The difference between good and bad lies in tensile strength, toughness, smoothness, and softness. Feilun (Flying Wheel) brand wood yarn skeins have been loved and cherished by all parties for many years because of their excellent quality. After using them, there are no defects such as "button detachment" or "seam cracking." Therefore, it is worth paying attention to when choosing wood yarn skeins.</p>
<h3 id="e87">A Warrior in the Industrial World: Mr. Wu Yun Chu <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Yun Chu, the founder of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, has returned to Shanghai for nearly forty days. Because he has always adhered to the spirit of hard work and pragmatism, and does not pay attention to meaningless publicity and socializing, he has not made any statements. When the author visited Mr. Wu this time, he began by saying that he had no special opinions to express, and that he was striving to do his job to the best of his ability. The following describes the situation of the three important industries created by Mr. Wu.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu was a hardworking man in his youth. After graduating from middle school, because of his inclination, he was admitted to the chemistry department of the Shanghai Ordnance Special School of the Ministry of the Army. After graduation, he successively served as a chemistry professor at the Ordnance Special School, a steelmaking technician at the Ordnance Factory, general manager and chief technician of the Hanchang Soda Company, and chief of the physics and chemistry section and chief of the pharmaceutical section and acid manufacturing section of the Hanyang Arsenal. In 1923, after the successful testing of monosodium glutamate, he founded the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory.</p>
<p>The most important raw materials for manufacturing monosodium glutamate are wheat gluten and hydrochloric acid. If these important raw materials have to rely on external supply, it will not be a long-term solution. Especially because hydrochloric acid was a Japanese product, he founded the Shanghai Starch Factory to supply the wheat gluten needed by the Tianchu Factory, and founded the Tianyuan Electrochemistry Factory to supply the hydrochloric acid needed by the Tianchu Factory.</p>
<p>Among the products of the Tianyuan Electrochemistry Factory, in addition to hydrochloric acid, there are also bleaching powder and caustic soda, which are important industrial raw materials. However, there is a large amount of hydrogen, and if it is not utilized, it is a great pity. Therefore, he then founded the Tianli Nitrogen Products Factory.</p>
<p>The field of nitrogen products is very broad. It is not only an important chemical industry but also an important national defense industry. In the inaugural commemorative album of the factory, Mr. Wu described the preparations at the time: "In 1932, the American DuPont Company intended to sell a synthetic argon (i.e., synthetic ammonia) plant in Seattle and sent personnel to contact it. I happened to be traveling to Europe and the United States, so I went to inspect it and found that its machinery and equipment were still in good condition, so I began to negotiate. The agreement was reached in November 1933. When this agreement was first proposed, the shareholders of the Tianchu and Tianyuan companies were willing to invest in Tianli. Although they were told that the capital of the basic chemical industry was huge and the profit was small, those who subscribed to shares were still enthusiastic. A million yuan of capital was raised in no time. In January 1934, it was established. Later, the Ministry of Industry decided to run a ammonium sulfate factory by itself, and commissioned industrialist Mr. Fan Xudong to preside over it. For the sake of cooperation and for the sake of meeting the urgent needs of industry, after discussing with Mr. Fan, we concentrated our efforts on the manufacture of nitric acid, and decided to use the air method, that is, to purchase a complete set of machinery from France with a daily output of 12 tons of nitric acid. In July, I went to Europe again to inspect the machinery I had ordered and to investigate the progress of nitric acid production methods. I returned to China in October and actively installed the machinery. At that time, the machinery of the [ammonia] plant had already been shipped to Shanghai in advance, and the machinery of the acid plant also arrived in batches by the end of the year. By August 1935, anhydrous [liquid ammonia] was produced, in September, dilute nitric acid was produced, in October, concentrated nitric acid was produced, and in November, the sulfuric acid concentration device was completed.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wu's original plan, nitric acid can be used to manufacture explosives and contribute to national defense. He also wanted to further use his experience in manufacturing light gas to manufacture synthetic gasoline using the light coal method. He personally went to Germany to order machines and returned to Shanghai at 5 p.m. on August 13th, when the war had already started at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Since August 13th, he had to relocate inland with the government. He first arrived in Hankou, but before the factory construction was even half completed, Nanjing fell and Hankou was in a state of emergency. He had to sacrifice the work that had been done and move to Hong Kong and Chongqing separately, where he built factories. In Hong Kong, he manufactured monosodium glutamate and hydrochloric acid, and in Chongqing, he manufactured chemical raw materials such as bleaching powder and caustic soda for the paper and soap factories.</p>
<p>Building factories in the interior, due to material constraints such as the lack of transportation tools and building materials, required at least double the effort, and the difficulties were countless and the suffering was unspeakable. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Hong Kong factory refused to cooperate with the enemy and deliberately destroyed important parts. The most important parts were moved to Chongqing to prove to the British ambassador that the Chinese people had international credibility. The Hong Kong factory was occupied by the Japanese invaders. The monosodium glutamate factory in Xinqiao Road, South Shanghai, and the starch and glucose factories in Qu Zhenren Road were destroyed by the enemy. At present, they have become a vacant lot. Currently, only the old site of the packaging department on Caishi Road in Shanghai is used for small-scale production.</p>
<p>The future work, under the current economic difficulties and rising labor unrest, is to sort out and reorganize this devastated situation and rebuild. But with Mr. Wu's strong perseverance and full spirit, he will definitely be able to complete the work of revival in the midst of all difficulties.</p>
<p>Among the joint organizations of the industrial sector during the War of Resistance, the Shanghai Industrialists' Relocation to Sichuan Federation, which was mainly composed of Shanghai industrialists, was historically rich and had considerable strength. The National Industrial Association was established in Chongqing on April 22, 1943, with branches in various industrial areas to seek contact between factories and factories, industry and the government, and the industrial sector and the outside world. Mr. Wu is the current chairman of the National Industrial Association and the former chairman of the Sichuan Factory Relocation Federation. Recently, the directors and supervisors of the National Industrial Association have met and moved the headquarters of the association to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu saw the lack and need for chemical talents in China and established the Qinghan Education Foundation in March 1931, which has cultivated many useful talents.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu has devoted himself to the chemical industry for decades, only seeking progress in his career and not hoping to receive monetary rewards. Therefore, he constantly moved forward in peacetime and worked hard during wartime. He can truly be said to be a heroic warrior in the Chinese industrial world and can be a role model for those who are devoted to industry.</p>
