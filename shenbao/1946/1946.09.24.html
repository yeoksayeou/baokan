<p>〔本報南昌廿三日電〕蔣主席可能於廿四日啓節離南昌，傳將先赴贛州，然後再飛粤巡視，週內返京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕確息，蔣主席此次蒞贛，在勝利後，尙屬首次，復感於江西民衆之熱烈歡迎，故擬略事勾留，返京期或尙有數日。</p>
<p>〔本報南昌廿三日電〕贛省會各界歡迎元首大會與擴大紀念週，於廿三日晨九時在南昌體育塲合併舉行，與會單位多至二百餘，參加羣衆多至十萬人，第六軍官總隊編餘軍官八千餘人，亦列隊步行到會，致會塲內及塲外之環湖馬路，均爲歡迎羣衆所擁塞，但會塲秩序與空氣極爲肅穆熱烈，鐘鳴九下，雍容慈祥之蔣主席，乘車蒞臨，全塲肅立鼓當歡迎，大會開始，由蔣主席領導行禮如儀後，首由六十六歲之耆紳歐陽武與七十一歲之農民代表徐榮貴，代表各界向主席獻「萬邦之貞」錦旗一面，主席含笑接受，連稱謝謝，繼由靑年團代表徐祥庠獻呈一千五百團員簽名之紀念册一册，獻旗，獻紀念册禮畢，主席致訓，勉埋頭苦幹建設新江西〔原詞見後〕，歷時的四十五分鐘，羣衆時以熱烈掌聲接受其慰勉德意，大會隨於「擁護元首」，「服從元首」，「中國國民黨萬歲」，「中華民國萬歲」，「元首萬歲」歡呼聲中結束，元首亦即於歡呼聲與樂聲中，步出會塲，臨行猶頻頻揮手，以答謝羣衆敬意。旋登車返行轅。</p>
<p>主席訓詞全文</p>
<p>〔中央社南昌廿三日電〕蔣主席廿三日上午十時出席江西省會各界歡迎元首大會，訓詞原文發表如次！</p>
<p>王主席·江西各界父老·同胞·軍官同志·靑年子弟們，今天中正在抗戰勝利以後來到南昌，與我們江西各界父老同胞相見，實在是我平生最値得紀念，也是我惑覺得最快樂，最足自慰的一天。</p>
<p>偉大的貢獻</p>
<p>今天在塲的各位父老同胞，大多數都還記得，民國十五年的時候，本人率領國民革命軍由廣東北伐，經過長沙，旋即擊潰江西方面的軍閥，克復了南昌，所以南昌是我們北伐前進的第一個根據地，而同時，江西男女老幼同胞，人人擁護國民政府，効忠國民革命，對於北伐的貢獻，實在是非常偉大，可以說後來北伐之所以能如此迅速完成，大部份是由於我們江西全省同胞輸財輸力，竭誠擁護的結果，這是本席廿年來對於江西同胞時刻所不忘的一件大事。自從民國廿年以後到廿三年，江西全省陷於長期的匪亂，可以說當時的江西沒有一片乾凈土，同胞的生活，眞是如水益深，如火益熱。我初到南昌的時侯，一般社會對於匪亂的恐怕，幾乎比洪水猛獸還要厲害，在這一個期間，我們江西遭受匪亂而犧牲的同胞，總計起來，至少在五百萬人以上，至於財產的損失，更是不可勝數。然自民國廿二年實行新生活運動以來，對怕匪的心理，完全改變了，當時，江西男女老幼，個個人不但不怕匪，而且對匪這種殺人放火，慘無人道的行動，只有痛恨刺骨，我們江西的同胞，無論遭遇了怎樣的艱難困苦，顚沛流離，其對於政府的忠誠，革命的擁護，眞是再接再勵，自始至終信仰政府，服從命令，共同一致，誓復匪仇，所以不待二年，那樣滔天的大鍋，就撲滅了。廿三年的冬季，社會的秩序，亦就漸漸的安定下來了，由此可見，我們江西同胞，人人都具有革命的熱誠，都能保鄉保國，愛國自愛，眞不愧爲現代的國民。不幸到了民國廿六年，日寇發動了蘆溝橋事變，於是我們中國展開了全面的抗戰，八年之間，江西全省的同志同胞，在政府領導之下，服從命令，始終一致和敵人作殊死的鬥爭，由此可見我們江西對於抗戰的勝利，更有其偉大的功績。各位都記得，我們全國抗戰的國策和後來一切抗戰的計劃，都是在我們江西的廬山決定的，可以說，江西就是抗戰勝利的發祥地。總之，江西對於近廿年來國民革命的發展，實有不可磨滅的貢獻，在中國革命歷史上，實佔有最光榮的一頁，這種歷史的光榮，我們全省同胞，必須一致愛護，發揚光大，使之永垂不朽。</p>
<p>以新運精神　建贛爲模範省</p>
<p>但是本人此次來到江西，適値江西在長期抗戰之後，地方殘破，民生痛苦，不勝其悲痛憂傷。然而本人根據以往的經騐，確信我們江西同胞建設的精神和恢復的力量，比我們全中國任何一省的同胞都無遜色，我們江西從十九年起，經過六年長期的匪禍，但到廿四年匪患敉平的時候，不僅社會的秩序迅即恢復，而且農工商業各界都有一種欣欣向榮的氣象，尤其是建設事業，更是一日千里，就是自二十四年至二十六年兩年之內，完成了贛浙，贛湘兩條鐵路，完成了全省公路各幹錢，而且修築了這條贛江大橋，其他敎育，經濟的建設，更是不遑枚舉，這種偉大的建設力量，是我們應該特別自勉而加以發揮的。我相信，江西全省同胞，如果能够在省政府領導之下，如同過去一樣，共同一致，埋頭苦幹，則三年之內，必能建設江西省之成爲全國的模範省。</p>
<p>講到這裏，還有一點要提起各位同胞的注意：我們江西過去對於革命抗戰與剿匪所以能够有如此偉大的成就，主要的原因，是由於我們有一個精神的力量，這個精神的力量是什麼？就是民國二十二年二月十九日我在南昌提倡的新生活運動，這個運動的要義，是納禮義廉恥四維於衣食住行的日常生活之中，由日常生活的改革，而達到提高民族精神，發揚民族道德的目的，這個運動亦發祥於你們的江西，後來普遍推行到全國，我認爲這個運動對於當時剿匪的成功，與今日抗戰的勝利，實在有最大的影響，今後建國的工作，較之過去的抗戰，尤爲艱鉅，因此，我更希望我們江西的同胞，一本開始實行新生活運動時代的精神，明禮義，知廉恥，負責任，守紀律，刻苦耐勞，埋頭努力，來完成我們新江西的建設。</p>
<p>助退伍軍官　繼續努力建國</p>
<p>最後，我來到南昌，還見到我們軍官總隊的學員，受到一般同胞的歡迎和愛護，彼此親愛精誠，互助合作，心裏更覺得十分快慰，各位都知道，這二十年來，我們國民革命軍全體官兵，無時無刻不在犧牲苦鬥之中，可以說跟着我統帥作戰，沒有過一天安樂的日子。他們在北伐之後，繼之以剿匪，剿匪之後，繼之以抗戰，其勛勞功績，都値得全國同胞的愛護與敬佩，永誌不忘，然而抗戰勝利之後足有十五萬以上的軍官，在政府一令之下，遵命退役，拋棄了現有的軍職，犧牲了崇高的地位，這件大事，可說我們中國自有歷史以來所未曾有的偉績，這是我們中國政治，軍事上最大的進步，也是我們中國全體軍人救國的人格與革命的精神最高的表現，這就可以證明今天眞正愛國愛民的軍隊和軍官，絕無自私自利的觀念，只有一片純潔光明的心地，効忠國家，愛護同胞，所以我們同胞對於這些服從命令犧牲自我的國家浪伍軍官，必須一本過去二十年來擁護政府，愛戴國民革命軍的精神，來愛護他們，幫助他們，使他們在結束其軍事生活之後，仍能繼續爲國效力，參加建國的工作，如此，纔能表示我們一般同胞崇德報功的至意。我們軍官同袍，更要自愛自重，刻苦守分，來做社會的表率，國民的模範，乃能眞正完成我們國民革命軍人抗戰建國的使命。</p>
<p>中正今天和我們江西父老同胞相見，心中愉快萬分，沒有其他的方法可以表達我心中的感慰，惟有一腔熱血，一片純誠，願與我江西同胞互相勉勵，爲建設新江西與新中國而努力，謹祝江西全省同胞　康進步。</p>
<h3 id="c2">主席茶會招待來賓　接見蔡署長指示救濟工作 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南昌廿三日電〕蔣主席廿三日下午四時半在省府禮堂招待中外來賓茶會，到聯總駐贛代表鄧肯，天主堂總司鐸施美德，基督敎牧師高綏福，士紳彭程萬，歐陽武及周故軍長渾元與胡故師長祖玉後裔周靈元，胡德馨等百餘人，席間主席起立致詞，對江西之建設再三致意，略謂：建設事業必由小而大，由近而遠。江西之建設應自南昌始，全國之建設，應自江西始，江西以過去文化之昌明，人民之聰慧，加以物質條件之優厚，若能輔以現代之科學組織等技術，則建設成績必可一日千里。主席最後勉江西全省黨政軍各界，在王主席領導之下，共同一致埋頭努力，相信三五年內必可使江西成爲全國模範省。主席對聯總之工作，予以稱許，並希望大家效法西人之工作精神與方法，詞畢，全塲一致鼓掌，茶會至六時許盡歡而散。</p>
<p>〔又電〕蔣主席廿三日接見行總贛分署長蔡孟堅，指示救濟工作甚詳。又廿三日茶會中，主席對聯總駐贛代表鄧肯及所屬外籍工作人員之工作精神，及其與行總分署取得密切配合，甚爲贊許，幷表示農田水利甚爲重要、應加努力。</p>
<h3 id="c3">張厲生向本報記者談　政府對時局態度　以理智判斷事實以忍耐期待結果 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕張厲生廿三日答本報記者詢問商談形勢時，略稱：和平商談目前雖形擱淺，但各方仍不斷接觸，吾人當以理智判斷事實，以忍耐期待結果，相信終有成就希望。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕司徒大十一時其私人顧問傅涇波與來訪之皮宗敢氏談約三刻鐘，餘無活動。據各方觀察，目前似正靜待蔣主席返京後，始能有所進展。共產黨代表團發言人今晚稱：周恩來先生在滬，正等待消息，一俟軍事三人小組會議召開有期，周當立即返京。</p>
<h3 id="c4">吳鐵城等五人　昨舉行談話會 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕政治商談過程中，昨經共產黨提出第二次備忘錄後，今日除共產黨代表無往返外　政府代表仍互有接觸，顯示在期待主席返京期中，政府方面仍欲尋覓妥適辦法，以達和平之途徑。廿三日晨國府紀念週後，吳鼎富·吳鐵城·邵力子·彭學沛·王世杰五人曾舉行一談話會、就當前時局予以硏討。中午吳　　復至普陀路陳總長公館，與陳　談甚久，並同進午餐，衆信政府代表正就共產黨之備忘錄內所提要求加以研討，並聞吳鐵城·張厲生·兪大維諸氏，廿四日晚將在美大使館晚餐，並談論目的局勢。</p>
<h3 id="c5">馬使與兪大維　商談一般問題 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕馬歇爾特使廿三日上午八時三刻，在行館接見兪大維，長談至十一時五十分始止，據兪稱：彼等所談仍爲一般時局問題，然衆信當係就共產議之備忘錄內容加以硏究。該項備忘錄主旨，在軍事三人會議之召開，兪則爲三人會政府代表徐永昌之代表也。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿三日電〕馬歇爾特使及司徒雷登大使兩調人之努力，暫時已陷於停頓，可靠方面謂，馬司二人暫時均不擬再行發動調處，預料在蔣主席返京以前，僵局不致有任何改變。關於共方所提之備忘錄，馬師在未與蔣主席交換意見以前，不擬予以答覆。</p>
<h3 id="c6">我爲貨秈基金簽字國　匯率變動受限制　經濟專家論貨幣貶値 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社南京廿三日電〕官方雖鄭重聲明外匯率決不變更，然南京之外匯市塲仍依上海市塲而變動，馬路交易今日行情爲美鈔一元易法幣三五五〇元，大票僅能易得三四〇〇元，一般經營美鈔者似均看高。據某與中國貨幣制度有密切關係之經濟專家稱：中國乃國際貨幣基金之簽字國，該會曾於一月前規定各會員國應於發出最後通知三月以內，將其國幣對各重要金本位貨幣（即美元，英鎊，及法郞）之永久性穩定交換率，向該會登記，其目的爲防止各國國幣在規定之限期以前，再有重大貶値之事發生，迨至所定限期屆滿之後，中國及其他每一簽字國均須受其已登記之匯率之束縛，若國內局勢必須使貨幣再度貶値時，其所貶之價値亦不得再超過十分之一，且此一調整至少須於登記後六月再得實行。負責觀察家深知百分之十三再度調整，實不足以應付可能經常發生之貶値，因此在兩閱月內，實有再行宣佈一次最後貶値之必要、若不幸於此一貶値以後，情形仍每况愈下則中國仍有向國際貨幣基金會撤退貶値限制之權，然此舉不啻向全世界宣佈國家之破產，當非任何國家所願爲也。</p>
<p>〔聯合社天津二十三日電〕上海謠傳法幣對美元官定匯率，即將再度調整後，此間公開市塲上美元市價已創新高峯，截至目前爲止，最高價爲三六一〇元。</p>
<h3 id="c7">隴海路東段　明日起通車 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕隴海路東段開封至徐州間鐵路，日前遭共軍破壞，損失慘重，近日軍事好轉，該段搶修工程進展至爲神速，一週之間竟將一百九十四里損壞路綫整個修復，交部二十三日已接徐州電話，該路二十五日通車。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕據悉，交通當局正考慮延長隴海西段至蘭州，並派專家赴天水實地硏究。路綫西展後，將頗有利於玉門油礦之開發，及西北邊防之鞏固。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕確息，察東共軍第一道防綫之康莊左右前方，昨起與國軍接觸頻繁，若干小據點，已入國軍掌握，此爲國軍正式進軍之序幕，康莊已入國軍大砲射程，一旦開始爭奪，可迅速攻下。聞國軍今後採取之新戰術，爲使重要據點之共軍，白動退却。又平古綫順義西方十三公里之校各莊，昨晚被由冀東調來之共軍四個團攻佔，戰鬥頗激烈，現國軍正反攻，該股共軍行動，似在牽制平綏路國軍前進，並威脅平古路。</p>

<p>〔本報南昌廿三日電〕蔣主席廿三日晨在南昌省會各界歡迎元首大會席上，於慰勉江西同胞後，曾公開讚揚第六軍官總隊儘大之成就，對該總隊一萬以上之編餘軍官與南昌廿萬市民精誠團結，親密合作，甚能獲得各方之好評，表示非常快慰。主席言至此，並以動人之演詞特別提及勝利以後政府按照旣定方針編整國軍，以完成軍事復員大計，在一個命令發出以後，整軍工作立見責施，截至今日止，至少已有十五萬軍官遵令退職，進入各個軍官總隊，接受適合建國需要之各種轉業訓練，自有歷史以來所未曾有的偉績（大鼓掌）。中華民國之軍人，均能了然今日建國任務之重要，我們的建國工作，一完可以完成（全塲十萬民衆大鼓掌），這的確是我們中華民族五千年來稀有的奇蹟。</p>
<p>當記者在本月十三日訪問靑雲譜第六軍官總隊，探詢該總隊所屬各大隊業科訓練，轉業敎學方針，各軍官轉業志願及其人數，編餘軍官入隊受訓之情緒，編餘軍官對於國是前途之看法，編餘軍官對本身出路之想法，記者不禁向同行諸人說，政府爲了澈底實施軍事復員大計，擬訂的編餘軍官轉業辦法，古今中外史無前例，較之漢唐時代「杯酒釋兵權裂土封藩」那種落後的思想，眞是高明一萬倍，進步五千年，我們四萬五千萬局胞，不要口頭擁護元首，服從元首，應該從元首發明的救國建國大計，去體騐元首的苦心與德意，擁護元首硏訂勇邁漢唐，智逾歐美的整軍復員大計，因爲漢高祖，唐太宗裁編將士，沒有轉業善後的辦法，歐美有復業辦法，無轉業訓練，提高中華民族的武德，以解決中華民族五千年來最危險，晨令人頭痛的一個裁兵問題。</p>
<p>主席這次來南昌，聽到並看到我國軍官轉業訓練的一切情形後，非常高興，曾當面慰勉第六軍官總隊長陳沛將軍和三位總隊附，七位大隊長，爲各編餘軍官盡力解除困難，編餘軍官本身及其家庭如有重要困難，可由陳沛將軍代爲呈報主席，設法解決，這一個消息公布後，今天參加歡迎元首大會八千編餘軍官，雖然來去步行五小時，站立兩小時，一點兒也沒有感覺疲勞。他們之中，有的曾任總副司令，有的曾任軍師長，可是現在吃的，住的，穿的，行的，等於一個兵，當大軍官能重過士兵生活，而甚之如飴，這不是退步，而是進步，編入第六軍官總隊，繼續接受學術兩科，言及轉業訓練的軍官，九月份人數計有步九四二八人，騎四八人，砲一四八人，工兵二四四人，輜重三六人，交通二一四人，土木一四人，憲警一二四人，政工二九八人，軍需三四九人，會計五三人，技術一一人，軍屬一五一人，軍醫二四三人，總計一一四五六人，就中編餘軍官轉業志願的如下列：交通二〇六人，工鐵郵航空電警政一九〇四人，新軍幹部一三三四人，兵役班一六人，行政官吏四八五人，農林　殖四四九人，深造四二〇人，勞動服勞三四五人，民衆義務敎育二一五人，礦廠管理一五三六人，金融財政三〇五人，留美五人，地方衛生二〇四人，陸大八〇人，官吏五四人，計九三三〇人，該總隊編餘人數階級，計如下述：中將一一人，少將七三人，上校五〇九人，少校八七六人，上尉二四〇〇人，中尉二一六二人，少尉二二九五人，准尉一一八九人。又查九月份第六軍官隊在隊受轉業訓練之軍官總數爲九七〇〇人，截至今日止，共撥人數的如下述：九月份總員九七〇〇人，退職離隊四四七人，志願赴東北一四二人，退役一九二九人，除役九人，撥省訓團二一〇〇人。（單獨轉業）農墾二四人，財政七四人，土地測量二二人。（調徐州）指定者四一人，未指定者三三〇人，參加水產訓練五七二人，新軍幹部二四一人，技術軍官三七五人，警員三三三人，軍官區八五六人，新聞　六一人。我們從上列各項統計敎字觀察，第六軍官總隊的組織與人數及其成就，可以想像國內其他廿五個總隊任務之重大，我們希望各個軍官總隊都有好的成績做出來，拿事實來打歪那班擁兵殃民新軍閥的嘴巴，我們現在僅就目前整軍的輝煌成果言，應該歡呼「十五萬人齊解甲，軍人的是好男兒」。</p>

<h3 id="c15">四國外長齊巴黎 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>巴黎和會進行以來，瞬已經月，迄未成立若何協議。各方關注，自至殷切。大戰甫停，對於重建歐洲的和平秩序，各國意見未能盡同，且亦不欲草率從事，這正是締造和平應有的現象。所以我們對於巴黎和會進行的滯緩，自不宜存著什麼失望的心情。在巴黎和會正在進行之際，我們先後看見有美國務卿，蘇聯外長，英國外長，先後遷離巴黎，或前往莫斯科，或視察德國的戰領區，或返歸倫敦；其後又看見有美國務卿貝爾納斯在德國的演說，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫在和會小組委員會席上的演說，對於美國及蘇聯的外交政策各有所闡明。而在這個時候，美商務部長華萊士又在美發表演說，主張對蘇綏靖，於是興論嘩然，羣起責難，華萊士不得不掛冠而去。現在華萊士既已去職，由華萊士演說所引起的風波也漸歸於平靜，而些際四國外長卻又重集於巴黎，趜於停噸的巴黎和會可能復趜活躍，即擱置已久的外長會議，亦有重新召開的可能。是則經過了一小時期的停噸和動盪，巴黎又將成爲國際外交活動的中心。本於過去數星期來的發展，我們願作一番國際政治的展望。</p>
<p>停戰一年來的世界局勢，顯因戰事的停止而停止了戰時所有的協調。本來，這協調的維持，缺乏相當實際的基礎，而僅是一種戰時的妥協。爲了維持這戰時的妥協，就是主張國際正義的羅斯福也不惜自棄其所奉的原則與其所處的立場，而與蘇聯不特築起一道髙髙的鐵幕，而且還要在鐵幕外撒布其社會主義國家的「新民主」主義，戰後世界顯爲這種氣氛所籠罩。在這種情勢之下，華萊士主張回復到一種新的「光榮的孤立」，而將中國作爲「化外」，隔著太平洋大西洋以觀歐洲及遠東的星星之火，這種華萊士主義的出現，雖是著「新孤立主義」的形相，其實也有些承襲二將大戰以前英美綏靖政策的衣缽。因此，關於英美的對外政策，我們不能不於別方面求之。</p>
<p>美國務卿貝爾納斯在斯都伽特的演說，闡明了美國政府對戰後歐洲的開明政策。其後，英國戰時首相邱吉爾亦在瑞士發表演說，主張連立歐洲聯邦，以爲歐洲庶幾可以回復其繁榮。邱吉爾以在野之身，所含不能代表英政府意向，然當今在英執政的工黨，雖主張實行被馬列主義者認爲「不科學的」社會主義，宨與蘇聯的「新民主」主義不能同日而語，故邱吉爾的演說也可能代表英國一部分人民的意見。歐洲聯邦的理想，這在歐洲人心目中並不新奇。第一次大戰後，法國的政治家頗有主張建立歐洲聯邦的，然而當時的情勢，理想徒成夢想。現在歐洲又感受威脅，說不定歐洲人民會感覺到有這種組織的必要了，然而能否形成，亦尚在模糊影響之中。</p>
<p>這樣演進的結果，將使世界成爲一個世界呢，抑將變成兩個？在實際上，一個世界原僅是一種崇髙的理想，而現實的鴻溝是早就存在著的了！世界正是多事的時候，我們固然不顯見鴻溝的距離愈來愈闊，而且毋甯祈禱著，趁現在這個時候，大家應該將這條鴻溝填塞，可是在填塞這條鴻溝的努力上，我們有權要求，各大國都要爲人類全體的安全而各有所忍讓，決不能單靠我們一方面，甚至不惜把所崇奉的原則，也像羅斯福總統那樣爲了遷就現實而相犧牲，現在如何努力填塞這條鴻溝，就得看齊案巴黎的外長的成就。</p>
<h3 id="c16">美蘇合作之門 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>華萊士的辭職，本報前日已有論及。我們爲世界全局打算，固然覺得華氏的演說既不能代表美國政府的外交政策，則美政府爲求外對一致起見，自有請他下野的必要，但無論如何，總還是非常惋惜這件不幸事實的發生。因爲，美蘇合作之門，多少又像隔了一層簾幕。</p>
<p>我們在此，願　述另外一種看法：華萊士的外交政策是對蘇聯讓步，貝爾納斯的外交政策是對蘇聯強硬，這歧異很顯明的。讓步，是否就能夠得黨蘇聯的合作？強硬，是否就能夠得到蘇聯的屈服？這兩點，誰也不能預料。不過貝爾納斯的強硬政策，到今天爲止，似乎不但沒有使蘇聯敢做的象徵，反而使美蘇的壁壘日形尖銳。華萊士的外政策，站在美國人的地位設想，似乎也許有著嘗試的必要。</p>
<p>華萊士的演說和致杜魯門函件中最大的兩點，就是他對於美蘇因了政治經濟制度不同而互不相信的嚴重問題，除掉他本人「深信」可以解決而外，並沒有確切的把握。美蘇的對立，本報十九日社評曾經指出，是兩種民主主義的衝突，換言之，就是美國民主主義和蘇聯共產主義的衝突。華萊士對於美蘇調和的方案，純粹注重軍事和經濟，而忽略了這兩個人類政治崇髙的理想。華萊士本來是農業專家。又任商務部長，專門留心農業和商業的人，不夠偏重人類生活方面的浮面現象，容易忽略人類促進實現浮面現象的思想活動。</p>
<p>思想是現象的泉源，依照黑格爾的看法，人類精神隨著歷史的演進，到處隨時要求自身的實現。現在美蘇的鬥爭，世界兩大集團的鬥爭，不是原子彈和海軍基地港口的鬥爭，而兩種偉大思想主義要求自身實現的鬥爭。克林姆宮內十四位共產黨領袖，爲著要實現他們從馬克斯繼承下來的思想，任何代價在所不惜，任何手段都可採取，任何國際條約都不能束縛他們。在這種情形之下，除非美國社會根本革命，變成蘇聯式的「新民主」，美蘇的合作，依然是沒有把握的，即使華萊士本人，也並沒有告訴美國人多少把握。</p>
<p>然而蘇聯式的「新民主」美國人除極少數的共產黨員而外，是不歡迎的，不但資本家不歡迎，就是工人也不見得歡迎。美國今天是最繁榮的國家，人民生活程度髙過世界任何的角落；生活既然舒適，又享受髙度的民主自由，全世界的工人中間，美國工人最沒有共產革命的意識。而美國根本沒有希望；就是在其他的民主國家，除非在它自己武力範圍以內，也沒有希望，加像希臘公民投票就是一個明例。人類固然要生活，但是也要自由。蘇聯式的「新民主」最大的缺憾，就是人民沒有自由！</p>
<p>有人認爲華萊士的演說，是美國白宮的一種試探。美國政府是不願意戰爭的，是願意同蘇聯合作的，但是任何的合作，不是一方面的事情。美國社總統既然讓華萊士發表演說，如果蘇聯有城意合作的反響，美國對蘇的強硬外交政策，也未嘗不可以逐漸轉變。假如這一個觀察是不錯的話，那麼社魯門總統要求華萊士辭職，正是他在希望之後仍然失望的表現！因爲自從華萊士演說發表以後，蘇聯官方報紙除大捧華萊士大罵貝爾納斯以外，政府方面並無若何具體的表示。在蘇聯這樣準態度之下，杜魯門總統便沒有理由採納華萊士的建議，把原子彈秘密雙手貢獻在史達林元帥面前了。</p>
<p>我們對於華萊士的辭職，非常惋惜，因爲他一篇演說，的確一度打開了美蘇攜手合作之門，現在客人不來，華氏辭職，這道門似乎又重新關閉了。但是我們仍然希望這一道門隨時都可以再開，而且相信會有一天再開。在中國，更祈禱著美蘇合作之門早些洞開。美國執政的人，不妨多多認識蘇聯，研究共產黨思想的背景；蘇聯領袖，也不妨走出克林姆宮，看一看世界的真面目，在他們互相了解的時候，就是世界和平真正萌芽的時候。</p>
<h3 id="c17">壓平髙利貸的必要 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>髙利貸，是目前工商界所感到最棘手問題之一。</p>
<p>一面鬧著通貨膨脹，一面又覺得游資過剩，苦無出路。照常理論，此時拆息應當低落，不應該發生髙利貸。不過理論是理論，事實還是事實。此類矛盾的現象，在目前的經濟界中，不止這一件事。</p>
<p>於是四聯的銀根緊縮政策，逐爲一般人所特別注目了。各式各樣的貸款，各地各業不斷地在申請著；商業行莊存款的提存額，也紛紛地在議論著；五千萬以上的借款，是否必須經過四聯的核准，又紛紛地在批評著；甚至四聯本身應否繼續存在，也有人提出這根本問題。</p>
<p>四聯所以抽緊銀根，不肯放款，當然也有其正當的理由。以意度之，安定物價，避免加以刺戟，當是主因之所在。回憶糧貸成立之初，不上二三日，各地米價便發生了絕大的衝動。那麼，他們這種謹慎的態度，也可說持之有故。</p>
<p>不過現在髙利貸的存是事實，一般工商業都感到轉周的困難也是事實，許多工廠和商店紛紛地倒了，更是事實。據說，現在日本的利牽不過二薇，台灣也不過六　，那麼，本埠一角半甚至二角左右的拆息，在要和人家竸爭的工商業界看來，是否過髙，應否改善，實在用不著再加以討論，難道那些主持四聯的大人先生，和金融巨頭，都不曾想到嗎？</p>
<p>物價髙漲的主要原因有二：　爲通貨膨脹，　爲供給不夠。這是最明顯的事實。因爲抽緊銀根的結果，許多生產事產已經支持不住了；以後物資的供應必然地將昌漸減少。這種情形，是否爲間接地抬髙物價？這問題，實不容加以忽視！</p>
<p>而且物價的漲風，似乎並不因銀根的收緊而中止，而回落。這幾日來，黃金，美鈔，紗，布，米，麥，麵粉，食油，呢絨，人造絲等主要商品，不是又在竸走飛躍嗎？一方面漲風依舊，抽緊銀根並不發生絲毫阻遏的作用，一方面卻反逼倒了工商業，間接地促進了漲風。我們認爲這種作風，確實已到了應該「知過必改」的階段，慎勿硬著頭皮錯到底，使中國的工商業歸於盡。</p>

<p>〔中央社紐約廿二日電〕紐約前鋒論壇報，昨駁斥周恩來所稱美國之政策正破壞中國經濟之聲明，該報評周氏之言，純爲宣傳作用，且企圖損害美國之聲望。該報之社論題稱：「周君之宣傳」，全文如下：最近中國最荒謬之一次聲明，即爲周恩來之聲明，渠稱，美國之政策正破壞中國之經濟，此身爲共黨官員之周君發之言，顯然純爲宣傳作用者，其目的顯在於其所能破壞美國之聲望，若周君城能關切中國經濟情形錯誤之興象，則渠自能毫無困難，列舉其真實之原因，蓋渠正如其他一般人士，而已明察，其原因毫無神秘處，第一原因，且亦爲最重要之原因，即爲中國政府已在職時喪失其一切最佳之收入來源，故不得不賴發行鈔票以生存，此舉已造成可怕之通貨膨脹．第二原因，即爲國共之衝突，延緩經濟之復員，其中一部分，係共軍有效切斷交通綫所致。第三原因，即爲政府中不少無效率或貪污（或兩者兼之）之官員。第四即爲蘇聯在東北破壞或移走地之工業設備，周君反以此歸咎美國，其所持之理由，爲若干美國剩餘物資交予中國政府後，即流入黑市，此言果屬不謬，然此事除在上海及多數各城外，其他各地並不重要，若稱中國之受苦，乃由於美國以其海陸軍所不再運用之物資售與中國所致，則此言可充分顯示其不合理及無頭腦也。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京廿三日電〕麥帥總部紡織顧問馬加納今日指責中國行政院長宋子文，并稱反對以任何蠶繭運往中國。按中國駐日代表團曾要求將日本蠶繭一午萬磅運至中國，遭麥帥總部拒絕，近曾表示不滿，且間接指責美國資本家企圖佔有日本絲業，故引起馬氏反響。據馬加納稱：日本所付佔領軍費用，其主要來源係出于日本之絲織業故該項計劃未獲如愿。中國絲廠曾于本年初在國內購買質地惡劣之蠶繭一大批，以爲由此種蠶繭制成之絲，可在美國或國際市場高價出售。中國方企圖以低價擭較優之日本蠶繭，用以將其前在本國購買蠶繭時所費之款爲之扯抵。日本正需其所有蠶繭，維持生絲出口，一部份日本絲廠現被催促改製棉織及人造絲織物，亦即爲此。刻已命令日人擴大桑田，籍以增加蠶繭數額，使每年生絲出口可達三千萬磅，戰前日本，每年輪出生絲曾達九千五百萬磅。中國現有蠶汞每年可製生絲二萬包，但此點中國尚未作到。中國代表團要求日本蠶汞運華，係出諸中國蠶絲公司直接向該代表團請求。美國商人從未假政府之手，要求麥帥總部爲之獲得日本出口商品。任何運華蠶繭均將使日本經濟愈愛虧損，故如以日蠶繭運華，將屬違反波茨坦宣言，與佔領日本之目的自不相符云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日民〕美政府援助日本恢復工業經濟，正在穩健進行。此事係國務院，陸軍部及其他政府機關合作，務使日本儘速恢復其經濟地位，至少足以自經，并籍專家援助，以支付聯合國之佔領軍費。日本紡織業，棉紗業及人造絲業，均獲得有力援助。美政府則收買日本所能生產之全部生絲，并將以更多援助，給予其人造畢業，使之復興，數月以來，復不斷以原棉輸入日本，并供給款項，俾購買日本所亟需之外國貨。惟日本重復加入棉織物出口市場，并未爲聯合國所一致贊同。遠東方面，印度需要棉織品，日紗廠亦願予以供應，惟中英兩國及其他生產者，均希望恢復其戰前營業。據美國當局見解，此事雖遭各方反對，仍將繼續與日本紡織業以大規模援助。</p>
<p>日本棉布　產力估計</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕日本佔領區內美軍政府最近報告書中宣布：日本紡織界，日本銀行與大藏省三方面，已成立協定，設立銀行團，資助棉織業之活動。戰前日本在世界市場上銷售之棉布，每年達三百萬碼以上。預料本年底以前，日本將恢復出口，其中大部份爲棉織品，生絲及美國棉花紡成之棉紗。美政府機關物品信用貸款公司本年度將供給日本棉花八十九萬包，其中一八五，三八四包已運到，此種棉花均將織成棉布，以供出口。日本紡錘因戰事影響百分之八十被毀，棉布出產因之大減，但預料至一九四七年底，生產能力可以加倍。棉紗之出產，因煤斤及化學品之缺乏而受限制，但紗漿之出產已大見增加。本年度生絲出產，大約爲一億五千萬碼，但僅有三千萬碼準備出口，日絲業出口商預料；五年之內，日本生絲出口。可恢復其世界市場之領導地位。聞美，英，蘇，三國因不同之理由，均願鼓勵日本出口紡織業之復興。美國方面希望日本以出口紡織品償付進口糧食與佔領費；英國則需要日本以棉織品供給英國各屬地；蘇聯則希望在物物交換制度下獲得日本紡織品，日本紡織業因此有欣欣向榮之象。</p>
<p>直接貿易　現難邀准</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿三日電〕麥帥總部國外貿易處經濟科學組組長皮開萊談稱：日本貿易促進會近致函貿易局，主張改變日本進出口貿易程序，由製造廠家與遠東各國實行物物交換，恐未能獲得麥帥批准。日本觀察團赴國外考察國際市場情形一事，恐將不獲允許，甚且不得對國際市場趜勢自由交換消息。麥帥總部現假手日本貿易局，監視日本邀出口貿易，且擬繼續監視，以期對日經濟有所裨助，并同時以各項缺少物品供給世界其他地方。據皮氏稱：日本商人常提及直接貿易，但日本自行管理國際貿易之時機，尤未成熟，總部現已人事研究，最后或將許與各國發生一部份商業關係，但爲時尚屬遙遠。總部刻已與各國實行物資交換。</p>

<p>〔改造社東京廿三日電〕遠東國際法庭檢察官，今日繼續提出種種證件，揭露軸心國外交之真相。一九三九年意外相齊亞諾與日駐意大使白島會談結果，首相平沼贊成德意日三國同盟，外相有田銷冷淡，白島則大爲贊成，結果附有保留條件甚多，欲將該同盟限爲對蘇同盟，大島·白島兩人拒將此項日本之訓令傳達德意，而希望日本全面接受同盟案。德駐日大使沃特六本國政府報告，謂日陸相及藏相贊成三國同盟，外海兩相則表示反對。陸軍力謀同盟之成立，如歸失敗，將退出內閣，而海軍則由海軍次官山本領導，表示反對。迨德蘇簽訂不侵犯條約后，三國同盟之交涉應行停止，又謂該項不侵犯條約達反防共協定，但大島并不將該項抗議失卻重要性后，茲將抗議書遞交德政府。一九四〇年德駐日大使斯塔瑪致本國政府報告稱：得大島，白島，寺內，</p>

<p>〔路透社報達廿二日電〕近在外約但沙漠中發見之羚羊人，現出伊拉克油公司之賈爾博特加意照顧中。據賈氏稱，當該一十五齡之奇人被捕獲時，曾以每小時五十哩之速率奔跑，速率較百碼之世界短跑記錄，尤离出兩倍餘。此一近代「泰山」，想係于幼時爲其母所棄，而爲一羣羚羊所收養，逐漸習得羚羊之各種特性，余曾詳細加以研究，覺其行動國，鳴聲，無一不似豢羚羊，僅願食青草，不原吃普通食物。但余確信彼乃人類，不過在豢羚羊羣中生長而已。常第一次被獵羚羊之人發見時，幾乎喪生，幸陰中一人見羊羣中有一小孩，立即招呼同伴不得開槍，乃開汽車追逐，而該孩即以每小時五十哩之速率奔跑，最后始力絕倒地。又據最初照顧該孩之魯華拉部落酉長稱，該孩在其家中之第一日，曾躍登屋頂，又自一屋頂躍至另一屋頂，后復躍入街中，最后出動車馬追捕，經兩小時餘始捕獲。當最初發見該孩時，傳說紛紜，有謂其係半人半羊者，今知該孩確係人類，僅較常人爲結實耳。渠當然不能作人語，僅能作羚羊鳴聲，據云，最近已斬習于人類生活。聞近東之遊牧民族母親往往將小孩棄于獸羣，但結果大多爲獸類所食，至于得爲獸類所撫育者，則殊不多見。</p>
<h3 id="c54">中東之謎（上） <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 巴鰓第原著　文豪節譯</p>
<p>在國際舞臺上，中東又要再度顯其身手了。在這里，英俄是對立著，美國是立在英國一面，而迭國也急急要走上舞臺，她最近曾做過好幾次的調人，至于中東的人民，在不久以前，他們是被買身于事外的，對於這幕戲情，簡直莫明其妙，可是現在情形不同了，人民的代表，不問是真的假的，也常常在這舞臺上估著相當的地位。中東的關鍵是握在英俄手中，英國深恐俄國在近東諸國中對于左派分子的鼓勵，會威脅大英帝國的生命綫。反之，俄國深穎英國會利用反動勢力所造成的政府，與其爲難。</p>
<p>困難在中東是到處醖醾著。其因素約可分爲三項：　英美法蘇間的利害衝突；　在過去三十年中，高度的國家主義深深抓住了伊斯蘭教；　由于在二次大戰中和西方之類頻繁接觸，造成了一種社會的覺醒，又由于俄國帶來的社會主義，使得這種覺醒更加速進行著。</p>
<p>自從文明誕生以后，地理和歷史便賜予中東以無上的戰略重要性，因爲它是許多大陸間的一個橋樑，一個橫道。它是亞洲的一部分，同時也是西方人東來的必經之道。在那里蘊藏著世界上最豐富的油礦以及其他許多尚未開發的資源。三強十分明瞭：任何一國如果單獨控制了中東，則最后必能控制亞洲及其十二萬萬人民，這差不多已佔全世界人口之一半了。</p>
<p>土耳其與海峽</p>
<p>貢國深恐俄國的影響會由韃靼尼爾海峽而入地中海，由伊朗而入波斯灣，這一種侵入，英國認爲是十分不利的，爲了抵抗這一種侵入，於是英國常常請求俄國和它同樣地尊重土耳其及伊朗領土政治之完整，在美國的護援之下，英國獲得了保守的土耳其和伊朗政府之較大信任。反之俄國也在宣傳英美是要控制整個中東之政治與經濟。俄國認爲它自己不僅被擯斥于中東油礦之外，并目爲了抵抗英國在那里所形成的軍事包圍而需要的海空根據地，也到處遭了有效期壁。在法意海軍崩潰的今日，地中海更成了不列顛湖了，蘇聯一直在要求著她對韃靼尼爾的權利。如果韃靼尼爾一旦入了俄國之手，則英國便無法阻止希臘的親俄黨奪取政權了。因此，土耳其和希臘一樣地形成了英國外交政策上一個關鍵。</p>
<p>伊朗事件</p>
<p>伊朗也橫臥在大英帝國的生命綫上，伊朗的海岸綫形成了整個波斯灣之東部。伊拉克，庫瓦特，蕯地阿拉伯則位于其北部西部諸區域。遠在一九一四年，庫瓦特便在英國保護之下成了一個獨立的教主國，同時蕯地阿拉伯國王自從握權以后，便與英國維持著友善的關係。按諸一八九二年三月所訂的獨佔協定，這些教主國，他們的君主本身，以及繼承人不得與英國以外之國家訂立協定或來往，也不得接受英國以外任何國家的使節，更不得割讓或出售任何土地與英國以外之國家。</p>
<p>因此，籍著這些條約，英國在波斯灣便充分地握著戰略的優勢。任何強權如果在伊朗南部佔了一席之地，便能干涉英國在阿拉伯海的交能綫。便能東進而敲北印之大門。俄國軍隊在今年三月二號以后開入了伊朗，英國便在聯合國安全理事會中大肆咆哮，其原因就在此。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會昨日上午舉行第二十一次會議，首先舉行紀念週，由潘議長公展致詞：市府預算於上星期六雖已開始討論，並已有若干決議，但對整個預算尙無總決定，故在今天議程中，首先要將預算決定，同時希望在上午會議中將與預算有關之加捐稅各案根據審查報吿討論決定，以彌補預算之不敷，如果我們僅通過預算，而不將彌補辦法決定，則通過之預算仍屬有名無實。其次本會各組審査報吿討論者僅及半數，如在今天（即昨大）展期之議程中不能討論完舉，大會或將展期一天或二天。最後，潘氏希望各參議員在此次大會中能始終貫澈不遲到不請假之精神，以免影饗開會，並爲選民負責任。據潘氏報吿大會最初幾天出席之參議員人數在一百五十人以上，而後來出席者僅有一百十人到一百廿人左右。</p>
<p>大會於上午討論市長交議稅捐案，經討論決議，取消房捐中附加保衛團服裝費及防疫經費後共計减少十八億元，併入預算收入中則收支不敷總數達二百二十一億元。開源辦法，娛樂捐仍提高至百分之五十征收，惟否決征收淸潔捐。同時通過征收公用事業附加捐（其中自來水捐不收）半年的可收入四十億元。房捐按實收房租百分之二十征收，　房東負担。下午討論市政捐由何人負担問題，情况頗爲熱烈，決議按房捐征收辦法由住戶負担。</p>
<p>大會最後通過市參議會各種委員會組織通則。各種委員會設主任委員一人，副主任委員二人，由各該委員互選，主任委員不得兼工會主任，任期三個月，於每次大會閉會後改選一次，每一參議員至少參加一會，至多參加二會，各種委員會每兩星期開會一次，必要時由主委召集臨時會議。</p>
<p>又大會因討論提案尙多，決展期至今日休會，今日議程將討論社會，敎育，工務，法規及、「賽馬」等問題，並將通過大會宣言。</p>
<p>收支不敷！如何彌補</p>
<p>討論兩焦點</p>
<p>上午大會中繼續討論本市下半年度預算，焦點集中於：（一）收支不敷數究應確定爲多少？（二）此項不敷數究應採用何種新的稅則以供彌補？</p>
<p>在確定不敷的數字以前，對於若干現有稅制以及市府收入項目有人提出了幾項問題：</p>
<p>旅客應盡納稅義務</p>
<p>吳正矱首先提出預算中所列二億餘元的旅棧捐是否合理？財政局長谷春帆立即予以解釋，他說凡是到上海的旅客同樣享受到上海的市政設施，當然也應該盡一部份的納稅義務。</p>
<p>議長則說明關於旅棧捐一項上次，臨參會中已決定徵收，故可不必再予討論，但後來金潤庠等再度提出經議長付請表決，結果僅極少數人贊成取消。</p>
<p>張學濂問市政府出售物資的收入四十億元以及各種公營事業的收入是否列人預算？孫云峰則問市府接收物資管理處接收到的物資是否亦列入預算？關於這幾點，市長即席起立答覆稱：出售物資的四十億元中百分之九十以上已在上半年內用之於公務員的生活補助　，公產方面因大部份產權牽涉　外交問題，尙待行政院指定　　理委員會來解決，至於接收的物資將來要列入敵僞產業管理處　內所以不能列爲預算。</p>
<p>撤銷房捐附加費　預算不敷增加</p>
<p>徐永祚指出上次大會中已決議取消房捐中的保衛團服裝費，但娛　損中本來亦附徵有該項服裝費，每月收入的爲四億元。如九月份起停徵，則不敷數將增加十六億元，如已收的七八月份亦須退還，則增加的不敷數將爲二十四億元。</p>
<p>對於這一個問題谷局長再度加以解釋，他說房捐中所附徵之保衛團服裝費在會計上係用「暫收款」科目分列，但娛樂捐中所附徵者則一向並不分開，均爲統收統支。如果加以取消，勢將發生困難之情形。事實上娛樂捐之爭論並不在於其中是否附徵服裝費，而是一個稅率百分比的問題，月前娛樂業方面曾經屢次請求减低，現在需要參議會決定的是：維持現在的稅率即照票價抽百分之四十呢還是恢復减少到以前的百分之三十？不過無論如何，如因减低稅率而增加的不敷數目還是要向市民頭上另行籌措，所以與其一樣要徵收，他認爲應該向那些有餘錢享受娛樂的人身上多收一些！</p>
<p>議長讀出了中央頒布的筵席娛樂捐法令，其中規定娛樂捐最多不得超過票價百分之五十，所以他說：「現在預算中所列僅爲票價百分之四十，並未超過規定，如果加以减低，將使全體市民囀遍增加負担，這是不對的！應該由有能力享受娛樂的人來負担！」嚴誇聲建議預算中罰金一項可增列三億元，但馮有眞加以反對，他認爲必須有違章才有罰金，如果規定數目太高，將來恐有藉端濫罰的情形發生。</p>
<p>不敷數二二一億　一百十票獲通過</p>
<p>枝節的討論至此已費去不少時間，議長終於決定將根本的原則即收支不數數的確定來提付表決。原先市政府所編預算不敷數爲三百三十三億元，經第九小組審核以後，應加的加，應减的减，核定收入爲五百五十一億餘元，去出七百五十四億餘元，不敷數爲二百零三億元，但因上次大會中決議取消房捐中附徵之保衛團服裝費及防疫經費共十八億元，故收入項下减少，不敷數則增爲二百廿一億元，這一個數字如果通過以後就須籌劃開源的辦法予以彌補，參議員們是否贊成？表決結果，到會一百十九人中舉手贊成的一百一十人，原則通過。</p>
<p>開源三法　徵收房捐改由房東負担　提高娛樂捐百分之五十　加徵公用事業附加捐</p>
<p>二百二十一億元的不敷數經表決確定以後，大會就討論如何開源彌補。市長交議五項辦法中除跑馬捐另案討論外，其餘房捐，市政捐，公用事業附加捐及淸潔捐四種經審查小組審査結果認爲應該採用市政捐及公用事業附加捐兩種。</p>
<p>審査經過據第三小組召集人路式導報吿是根據三種原則：（一）勿使市民有苛捐雜稅之感，（二）納稅標準依貧富爲比例，（三）徵收簡易不致有走漏的情形。硏討之下，覺得提高房捐雖比較容易爲市民接受，但與中央法令顯有牴觸，且恐影響到房租的增加，淸潔捐則有太爲苛細之感。公用事業附加捐最爲公平合理，徵收亦最容易，但數目太少，惟市政捐雖然徵收手續麻煩，但比較尙合公平之道，所以最初決定採用市政捐辦法，但通過以後小組會中有人提出複議，複議結果，雖仍維持原來決定，但贊成與反對之票數僅相差一票。後來有私人方面建議提出市政府建設捐的名稱，內容包括公用事業附加捐的四十億元，尙餘一百八十億餘元不敷數則依照現定的房捐比率由財政局酌最稅率徵收。</p>
<p>路氏報吿畢各參議員紛紛發表意見，討論非常激烈，重要的論點如下：</p>
<p>（一）公用事業附加捐中，有人認爲水捐不應徵收，因用水爲任何平民所必需。有人則認爲徵收電捐應　到工業界的情形，因工廠用電最多，尤以紗廠爲甚，取費亦較高，所以如欲培植工業，電捐之徵收尙應考慮。</p>
<p>名不正言不順</p>
<p>（二）最重要的是對於市政捐名稱的反對。童行白認爲市政捐實際上即是財產稅，按照房產價値徵收，合乎三民主義節制資本的政策，不過市政捐的名稱太糢糊，主張改爲房產稅，他說：「希望此後的捐稅集中在地產與房產上，不必枝枝節節的向平民頭上刮！」但議長指出市政捐的徵收對象是住戶，並非業主，故如要徵收財產稅，那是另外一件事，不能與市政捐併在一起，王劍鍔則提出從前工部局時代房捐就叫市政捐，現在有了房捐，如果再收市政捐，將予市民以不良印象他主張改稱爲市政建設捐。繼起發言的人很多，大多認爲房產稅的名稱旣名不符實，且有引起增加房租的可能，還是用市政建捐爲妥。</p>
<p>（三）陳公達另外提出一種開源的辦法，他認爲娛樂捐旣然法令規定最高可爲　分之五十，現所列僅百分之四十，可以再增加百分之十，如此則從十月份起至十二月底三個月中可增加稅收八億至十億元。</p>
<p>（四）徐永祚提出房捐中旣已剔除保衛團服裝費及防疫經費而减低徵收，其負担方式應予改善，應依中央法令按照實際租金額徵抽百分之三十，由房東負担。</p>
<p>通過三項　重要決議</p>
<p>經過幾十分鐘的討論，將各種意見歸納起來提付表決，最後通過三項重要決議：第一，娛樂捐稅率提高爲百分之五十。第二，房捐改按實際租金額徵收百分之二十，由房東負担，第三，加徵公用事業附加捐，尙不數之數，用市政建設捐名義由市府斟酌稅率徵收彌補。</p>
<p>最後，討論到市政建設捐的徵收辦法，究竟應該由房東負担？還是由房客負担？還是房東房客共同負担？</p>
<p>意見顯然也分成三派：一派認爲應由房東多多負担，他們的論點是房東旣然有房產，當然是有錢階級，有錢的應該多納些稅！一派認爲市政建設捐顧名思義是市政建設，根據權利養務平等原則，應由享受利益的人負担，現在房捐旣已決議由房東負担，市政建設捐就應由房客負担。介於這兩派中間的折中派則主張定出一個比例來由房東房客公平負担。</p>
<p>論爭紛紛，會議延長至十二時三刻尙無結果，最後由奚玉書建議留待下午提出具體數字研究後再行決定。</p>
<h3 id="c56">出席大會人員發言　對外不負任何責任　撥用寺廟一點有所聲明 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>

<p>昨日下午，市參議會繼續討論市政建設捐負擔問題，對於究應由房客負擔，還是房東房客共同負擔一點，各位參議員展開空前熱烈的辯論，並且多以實際的數目字爲根據。</p>
<p>最後通過的決議案爲：「（一）市政建設捐，應依父字第二號提案之　法征收，其總額之中，除房捐按實收房租征收百分之二十，應由房主負擔外，餘數即規定爲設捐捐率，是依房屋現値分爲三等甲等現値一億元或以上者收月捐千分之三。乙等現値在五千萬元或以上，而不及一億元者，收月捐千分之二。丙等現値在五千萬元以下者，收月捐千分之一。</p>
<p>徐永祚報吿　房東不堪負担</p>
<p>根據上面的捐率，徐永祚有一個數目字的報吿。他以二十六年度的房租爲標準，分爲甲乙丙三等。說明市政建設捐倘由房東負擔的話，房東將賠累不堪。假設甲等房屋，二十六年度月租五百元，以法定一百六十倍算，現在租金八萬元，除去應繳的百分之二十房捐計一萬六千元，凈收六萬四千元。這類房子在二十六年時的値五萬元，以五千倍計，現値二億五千萬元，征千分之三市政建設捐爲七十五萬元，除凈收之六萬四千元房租外，要賠六十八萬六千元，就是與房客各負擔一牛，也還要賠三十一萬一千元。乙等房屋，假定戰前租一百元，現租一萬六千元，除三千二百元房捐，凈收一萬二千八百元。現値五千萬元，需繳市政建設捐千分之二，計十萬元，要賠八萬七千二百元，房東房客平均負擔，房東也要賠二萬七千二百元。丙等房屋假定戰前租二十元，現在法定租金爲三千二百元，除去房捐六百四十元，淨收二千五百六十元。現値約一千萬元，應繳市政建設捐一萬元，要賠七千四百四十元，房東房客平均負擔，房東也要賠二千四百四十元。最後徐永祚問：「這種辦法是否合理，是否辦得到？結果房東只得將房屋放棄，因爲有了房子不僅無錢可賺，還要賠錢，誰還要房子？在房荒如此嚴重之秋，事實上也不可能。而且，市政建設捐倘由房東付，成爲了財產稅，是不合理的。顧名思義，理應山享受市政建設的人付」。</p>
<p>潘議長論　徵收辦法</p>
<p>潘議長發現了一件很奇怪的事，他說：「目前房屋估値很困難，而且財政局的估價人可操高下之權，難免不生流弊。市政建捐相率按房屋現値征收，徐參議員永祚已有數目字的說明，本席也的略算過，不過本席所算得的結果，較徐參議員約　高，計丙等房屋應繳市政建設捐一萬二千元，乙等應繳十二萬元，甲等應繳八十萬元。但有一件事很奇怪，倘照交字第二號辦法，繳納房捐，市府在半年內中可收一百八十億元，足以彌補預算之不足。而房客的負擔却减少了。本席不知道財政局怎樣估法的，但這個辦法對一般人民是有利的。房捐照實收房租征百分之二十，我們已決定了。現在我們可以採交字第二號的辦法，但不是房捐，而是市政建設捐。根據交字第二號辦法，本年秋季，甲等房屋房捐比夏季加三倍，乙等比夏季加二倍，丙等比夏季加一倍。到了冬季再加一借。所謂夏季房捐征收辦法，是照二十六年度房租的五百六十倍，征百分之十四。這就是說丙等房子，二十六年度租二十元，夏季房捐爲一五一二元，秋季爲三〇二四元，冬季爲六〇四八元。秋冬二季，平均不過四千五百多元，而且還可以除去房東所繳納之實收房租百分二十之房捐。但照房屋現値征千分之一，就是和房東平均負擔，房客也要付市政建設捐五千元。所以照這種辦法，房客是便宜的了。照這個辦法，乙等房屋，戰前租一百元的，秋季繳二萬二千六百八十元，冬季繳四萬五千三百六十元。但照市政建設捐捐率，房客負擔一半的話也得繳五萬元。甲等房屋，戰前租五百元的，秋季繳十五萬一千二首元，冬季繳三十萬零二千四百元。但照市政建設捐捐率，房客負擔一半，也得繳三十七萬五千元。所以，倘依照交字第二號的辦法征收，再從總額之中，減去房東應繳之房捐，房客可以便宜不少。這個數目，不論甲乙丙等房屋，房客所繳的錢，都比照房屋現値抽市政建設捐的一半來得少。所以本席建議採用這種辦法。」各參議員都熱烈鼔掌贊成。</p>
<p>負担問題　一塲論爭</p>
<p>關於數字上的統計報吿，谷局長和路式導也都有說明。谷局長所說明的是，房捐照實收房金征收百分之二十以後，房東的負擔輕重，看他所收的租金而定。房租收得高，房捐當然也就多了。至於路式導所說明的，是市政建設捐，由房東負擔是不合理的。</p>
<p>傳統先從理論上着一眼，他說：「我不計算數目字，但我們要追求眞理。老實說，講負擔，房東房客都負擔不起。現在所征收的是市政建設捐，誰享受市政建設，誰就得付捐，名不正則言不順，這一點，我們得弄明白。至於地主，將來要付地價稅，土地增値稅，那數目也一定自很大的。」奚玉書也就追求眞理發言，認爲眞理是在市政建設捐，應該由房客負擔。徐副議長說：「兄弟是勞動家却代表資本家說話。現在有錢的人手裏所有的，決不是房地產，而是金條，美鈔，棉紗及其他貨物。捐稅應該合理。」最後的結論也是「市政建設捐應由享受市政建設的人負擔。」</p>
<p>張志韓一度起立，大聲疾呼，請各參議員，不要對房東想得太多，而忘記了住戶，要知道，住戶也負擔不起的。王劍鍔也堅主應該顧到房客的負擔。</p>
<p>不要忘記二房東</p>
<p>對於房屋現値的估計法，李文杰金潤庠，陶百川等皆發表許多意見。馮有眞提醒大家，不要忘記房東及房客以外的第三種人：二房東。因爲對大房東，他是房客；對二房客，他又是房東，無往不利，佔盡了便宜。所以我們絕對不能放鬆二房東。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕地院於昨日下午三時續審德籍納粹嫌疑犯沈克自訴美合衆社駐滬辦事處主任侖道爾誹謗案，旁聽席坐爲之　，美籍者幾佔其半·沈克未到，由代理人姚肇第律師代表出席，侖道爾延陳霆銳律師辦護，發言時由合衆明名記者袁倫仁君任翻譯。兩造律師舌劍唇槍，激辯甚烈，至四時半，庭上宣佈辯論終結，定二十七日下午二時宣判。據陳　銳氏吿記者，法院雖定期宣判，仍不一定即爲受理本案之表示。</p>
<p>審訊於極緊張之空氣中開始。侖道爾步至被吿欄時，神態略見不安，袁倫仁立於其側，隨時將各人發言，以甚輕微之語聲傳譯。姚律師首向庭上聲明，沈克因覊押美軍事法庭看守所，故不能出席。庭上遂諭可由姚律飾代表。</p>
<p>就國際公法論　沈克無起訴權</p>
<p>陳霆銳律師遂起立，以緩慢而有力之語氣爲侖辯護。略謂）依法凡不提自訴而自訴之案件，法院應不予受理。至沈克之不得提起自之訴，則可以國際公法及中華民國的法爲根據。以國際公法規定言，沈克爲德籍，且係著名納粹份子，列名於我國遣送回德之名單，且以有戰犯行爲，故至今尙在美軍法庭覊押之中。目前中德尙未媾和，法律上尙處於交戰狀態，故自訴人之身份爲敵僑。敵僑有無起訴之權，在我國並無明文規定，然國際公法爲國際間共同承認之法律，故國際公法應可視爲各國法律中之一部份。按照國際公法在第一次世界大戰後之規定，對敵僑之起訴權有相對的權利之承認。英美二國，承認敵僑有起訴權，惟有一先決條件，即該敵僑必須繼續居住於所在國，且爲安分守己之良民，得爲常地政府容許居住者。而沈克固未得我國政府允許繼續居住中國，外交部駐滬辦事處曾來函證明，「沈克爲在遣送德僑回國名單之一人，因有戰犯罪嫌，業被覊押。」陳氏即將該函呈案，並續稱，由此可證沈克決非政府所歡迎或容許留居我國者，况沈克非但爲納粹黨員，且爲納粹中之間諜乎！故曰，就國際公法論之，沈克無起訴之權。</p>
<p>根據約法　請勿受理</p>
<p>次就我國之約法言，根據約法第二章第十五條，人民有發表言論及刊行著作之自由。我國政府亦早一再揭　言論自由爲政綱。被吿身任美國合衆社駐華辦事處處長，以其新聞記者之身份，其言論目由自更應受法律之嚴密保護，出版法第十九條第七條即有規定。記者報導新聞，向抱有聞必錄之旨，而今自訴人乃圖以納粹敵僑之身份，箝制友邦人士之自由，而向鈞院起訴，實爲喪心病狂！須知納粹之法律，固可禁止人民之言論自由，而納粹之法律，絕不能適用於民主之中國！本案不特與友邦在華之記者及出版人有關係，即於本國之記渚及出版人，關係亦極重大，應詛鈞院不予接受。</p>
<p>陳氏繼引國際公法權威奧本海之著作，略謂敵僑旣不能提訴訟，亦無出庭弁護之權。又引諾愛士之言，略謂對外僑之保護，應以安分守己及繼續居住者爲限。並言本案已引起國際間之注意。本市英文大美晚報曾刋一紐約來電，謂本案判決果結，對外國記者在中國有無言論自由之機會，影響甚大，中國政府當局爲維護言論自由起見，本案決不應受理云云。據云，今代表被吿，根據國際公法，根據的法，請庭上諭知不受理處分。</p>
<p>自訴代理人表示　無論戰勝戰敗　私權應受保護</p>
<p>沈克之代理人姚肇第律師即起而答辯稱：被吿律師之辯護，係根據國際公法及的法二點。茲先就的法方面加以答辯，的法誠規定言論自由，但此項自由，應有相當限制，否則刑法上妨害名譽之一章竟可廢止。故所謂自由者，應爲在法律範圍內之自由。被告是否超越的法所定之言論自由，仍請庭上調査後予以有罪或無罪之判決。再就國際公法言，在封建時代，戰事發生，戰敗者捨爲奴隷外別無他途。然應知此種觀念，爲封建時代之觀念。被吿律師所呈各書，本席未經寓目，是否斷章取義，亦不能言，然充其量僅爲一家之言，不足爲據。無論戰勝戰敗，人民之私種應受保護。一九〇七年各國曾在海牙簽訂國際公約，中美德等國皆簽字其上，其中第四章第二十三條第八項，曾明文規定，特別禁止消滅戰敗國人民起訴等權。蓋人不能離其權利而生存，不能不受法律之保護。試舉一例，强姦案件係吿訴乃論者，如被害人爲德僑，而不許其吿訴，則本案且將不能成立！</p>
<p>被吿之行爲實已超過記者應遵守之範圍，其所發消息來源不明，而誇張實多，其行爲已妨害我國之公共秩序。本案發生後，侖道爾竟向美國國務院申訴，其意實欲藉其本國之政治力量，挾制我國政府！務請庭上體察案情，顧全事實，平心靜氣，就案論案。</p>
<p>沈克之被遣回國，乃「一般性」之撒僑。被遣送者不一定即爲不良份子，蓋我國政府惟恐彼等滯華後無法維持生活，故令彼等回國，故被吿律師所云被遣送者即爲敗類之一點，實不足採·沈克現雖已被提起公訴，但尙未判決，而美軍法庭所起訴之罪行，僅爲刺探軍情，而實毫無事實根據，彼等實欲羅織周內，故意造成大獄而已！</p>
<p>是時，陳律師憤然起稱，本案之起訴即不合法，被吿方面不願循此不合法之途徑，而論本案之實體。</p>
<p>所謂證件有三</p>
<p>然姚律師雖經此打擊，仍繼續其陳述，謂被吿不能證明其所誹謗之事實爲眞實可靠，而起訴人方面，及可證明侖道爾之語爲絕非事實。證件有三：（一）陳介大使有函證明沈克之行爲向係有利於中國。（二）沈克係於一九四一年七月十一日離渝，經河內而至上海，有護照上各加簽可以證明。其離渝之時，中國尙未與德宣戰，今侖道爾乃謂其去渝即係破壞我國之地下工作，顯係響　虛構。（三）沈克回滬之後，且與我國地下工作之重要負責人常有往還。吳紹澍有函證明云，彼與沈克因組織部負責人之介紹，時常見面，且稱沈克爲中國之忠實友人，在渝時即常在報道中盛譽我國之抗戰，並曾揭露德國有親日之傾向。吳氏證函並稱，余等「常常見面，但並無互相利用，交換情報之事」。且謂「余對沈克，始終信任不疑，故時與相見」，後並聲明「余與沈克相識，及以後發生之關係，均曾呈報組織部在案」。可見侖道爾之所書，純屬子虛。</p>
<p>陳律師乃重起答辯，除重申沈克之自訴即不合法外，並稱：納粹之心目中，早無國際公法及條的存在。自訴代理人　奧本海之著作爲「一家之言」，然自訴代理人對國際公法之硏究，無論如何高明，當亦未必及此權威也，海牙公約之拘束程度，學說不一，是否適用，應由各國政府自定，即以英德二國論，即早表不予承認。條約之拘束應取互惠待遇，德國本身即早已中止應用，今乃又欲求此公的保護乎？</p>
<p>何以不到　何幫羈押</p>
<p>至謂被吿企圖用政治力量挾制中國，更屬笑談！事關中美德三國間之國際問題，被吿觀諸本國政府，亦不爲過，根本未有利用政治力量之企圖！自訴人應知問心有愧，因彼實欲利用中國法院判決之力量，企圖推翻美軍法庭證據確鑿之判　而已</p>
<p>自訴代理人　　遣送之敵僑不一定即爲壞蛋。亦爲缺乏常　中國政府遣送敵僑、　無一定之標準，外交部所遺送者，爲納粹分子，爲間諜，爲流氓之類，如被留中國之二千德僑今日在此起訴，本律師並不反對。又試間中德交戰時，在德華僑有起訴德否？如能證明確有起訴之權，始足以談互惠。况此訊之發表，初不限於合衆社。聯合社有之，申報·新聞報亦有之，蓋新聞之來源，實係美軍總部之記者招待會也。最後尙有一點：根據我國刑事訴訟法，自訴人經傳喚，無正當之理由面不到者，應不予受理。本案自訴人已傳喚二次，何以不到？如謂係被覊押之故，然則彼果又以何故而覊押乎？能否認爲正當之理由，仍請庭上考慮。</p>
<p>侖道爾至是乃於鵠立一個半小時之後，開始發言，略謂彼完全同意其辯護人之主張，今日不欲證明沈克之是否爲間諜。其所發報道之來源爲美國軍部，自訴代理人今日似欲本人證明美軍當局之言是否確實矣。</p>
<p>四時半，庭上宣稱辯論終結，定二十七日下午二時宣判。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕最近本市破獲之空運販毒案，前後逮捕人犯廿餘名，經警局連日偵査結果，除一部份因證據不足，予以交保開釋外，其餘有關人犯計十三名（內女性一名）業已全部偵訊完畢，定今日連同抄出約値一億元之嗎啡金條及運毒用之特製夾底手提箱等，一併移送地檢處。査該案破案經過頗爲曲折，而警局刑事警察處，曾爲此案動員第二課員警，不分晝夜，從事追尋綫索，甚至擴展警網至平，津，台灣等地。結果終於全部落網。</p>
<p>緣本月十日宣局長接獲密吿，謂有販毒巨魁宋志安，住林森中路和合坊三十二號，近有鉅款託本市新華銀行匯津。此款實係購運嗎啡之用。宜氏當晚即交刑事處張處長，囑即派員調査。經張氏與第二課　課長商討後，即晚先派課員馮起山，辦事員李錫淸等赴和合坊調査。不料該處竟係空屋，且屋主朱岐山，已在旬日前亦因販毒案被地檢處拘捕時逃逸。馮等因情節可疑，即加搜索，當得朱岐山頂屋契據一紙，其所頂之屋在蟠能街十號。遂跟踪追究，至十一日午後，始獲悉朱岐山匿居地址。乃率同警士張雲明，丁兆淦，高福海，丁文江等，馳至崑山花園四號十二號房間，在套室內將朱逮捕。當塲抄出咖啡精二磅，黑色毒料半面盆，正在搜査時，忽有台灣人孫志成者，挑金條四根，計重三十九兩五錢四分擬購買嗎啡，即予扣留，並派員至其住處武昌路積善里九號內，抄出嗎啡原料三磅二兩，戤一支。其時又有一衣冠楚楚體格魁梧之河北人，隨同軍官一名前來。該軍官並携有手提箱一只，迨進室後，發見室內情形特殊，即欲返身圖逃，當爲員警攔阻。經盤訊後，一名張明遠，卅二歲，一稱係九十四軍上校軍官名嚴東甫，卅七歲，謂方自天津搭中航機來滬。待警員令其出示身份證時，則支吾其詞，遂確定冒充無疑，當將其所携手提箱打開檢査，在該箱夾底內搜出嗎啡原料三磅五兩。至此，警員除將上項人犯一併帶局外，仍派員日夜留守該處。同時虹口警分局亦接獲密吿，在寳山路頤福里五十四號，皇家飯店三百十一號等處，拘獲是案同黨台灣人李紅英，張根田，張義仁，李定國，張李秉崑（女性）等五名，詳情已誌本報。是後警局在偵査時，復得悉該案總機關設在平，津，台灣等地，重要負責人即爲宋志安，經去電天津警局協緝，於本月十五日拘獲。而本市方面亦陸續拘獲周達，馬白午，呂新泉，宋自新，等四名，抄出特製之夾底箱三只，藏嗎啡用橡皮套三十五只，以及販毒盈餘派款單，往返電報稿底等證物頗多。又在周達處搜出東北挺進軍身份證及東北挺進軍軍用證明書云。</p>

<p>— 徐日淸</p>
<p>（三）綜合所得稅開征</p>
<p>我國過去所行分類所得稅，係以收益爲課徵對象，如企業之利潤，存款之利息，房屋之租金等收益，課以所得，故可稱爲收益稅，未能符合能力負擔公平之原則，綜合所得稅，係對全體所得課稅，故又名一般所得稅，而以納稅個人所得爲計算單位，故亦名從名稅，即對各納稅人所有之各種所得，合計爲總所得，再從總所得中减除各項費用，以其爲課稅標準，例如法國實行綜合所得稅，規定凡在法國境內之人民，每年所得在七千法郞以上者，皆應納此稅。</p>
<p>在新所得稅法中第三條規定，個人所得，除依照前條征課分類所得稅外，其所得總額超過六十萬元者，應加征綜合所得稅，其計算方法，合併個人全年各種所得，爲所得總額，但得减除左列各項，一，共同生活之家屬，或必須扶養之親屬，每人十萬元，二，家屬中有中等以上，學校學生每人五萬元，三，已納之各類所得稅，及土地稅，（同法第十九條）其申報方法，係由義人於每年五月一日以前，將其前一年所得種類及數額，報吿主管征收機關，主管征收機關與區鄉鎭公所，或中心小學，設立聯合申報會審査（同法第二十六·條），以免虛報不報之弊。</p>
<p>吾國過去藉口戶口不嚴密，統計不完整，未曾施行粽合所得稅，此次毅然決議實行，未嘗無相當理由，此後征收綜合所得稅困難重重，勢所必至，語云；人力勝天，想必有克復之日。</p>
<p>値此綜合所得稅創辦伊始，社會人士與輿論界均感有重複之嫌，按其實際，分類所得稅係對收益課稅，綜合所得稅係對人課稅，決無重複之病，因其對象不同也，綜合所得稅最八能力負担原則，同時進步稅制，必採累進稅率，吾國分類所得稅，限於環境，與條件不够，未能發揮其效能，使多者多出，少者少出，以證券存款所得一項而言，一萬元與一萬萬元存款所得，均抽10％，實不合理，故政府採綜合所得稅，補其不足，以防財富趨於集中，立法原意實屬完美，實施能否順利，尙待主其事者之努力；再考諸先進各國，先課分類所課，再課綜合所得稅者，計有法英意等國，又各國綜合所得稅之稅率，均較吾國爲高，如美國最低抽百分之十三，英國爲百分之十，日本爲百分之十，美國最高抽百分之七二’英國爲百分之四五，日本　百分之六十，而吾國最低（即超過六十萬元者）抽百分之五，最高亦不過百分之五十。</p>
<p>（四）一個大前提——經濟穩定</p>
<p>此次新所得稅法公佈，內容上都已參酌實際情形，客觀需要，已漸趨合理化之途，實可樂觀，惟新所得稅法公佈迄今，僅四閱月之久，因幣値日貶，物價步漲，一切條文似均失其時效，獨以新所得稅法中綜合所得稅起征點一項而言，已屬過低，據悉此項起征點，當時係根據戰前上海生活調査所得資料，與卅四年九月零售物價上漲二二二〇倍計算結果，現上海市物價，根據中央銀行經濟硏究處編製上海　要商品　售物價指數，本年六月份已漲三千七百多倍，現時過三月，加以外匯調整，物價均已上漲，據估計的四千倍，或一萬倍不等，相形之下，均患時過境遷之病，其餘各項規定，如薪給報酬所得稅之免稅點等，亦莫不皆然，故一切良法美意總須在一天前提下——經濟穩定，始克有濟。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c114">蘇北行（六）　泰縣東戰塲血影 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— 特派員杭舟</p>
<p>本報十日泰縣訊</p>
<p>蘇北有兩道長堤，這是爲人們所熱知的：左邊的是運河堤，右邊的是范公　，　堤之間爲一大片湖沼地區。以往人們每年要恐懼洪水冲倒了運河堤，使這一地區變成澤國；自從共產黨的軍隊來到蘇北以後，人們對洪水的恐懼已經被轉移了。——有太多的例子可以佐證，共軍所到之處，那兒便變成了「血海」。——「血海」是比「洪水」更可怖的名詞啊！</p>
<p>蘇北的地形限制了軍事活動，因此戰事不在運河堤上便在范公堤畔進行·當八月下旬邵伯大戰熱烈進行之際，共軍在右翼來了下突擊，如臯·海安·曲塘·黃橋等地，都又一次地展開了戰事，返鄕不久的人民又一次地走上了洗亡之逾。</p>
<p>於是，戰事的重心迅速地移到了右邊。共軍的攻勢顯然不僅在呼應左邊，並有進一步奪取兩泰，威脅江南的企圖。一個多月前，共軍作過如此的嘗試而慘敗了，現在它又重整旗鼔，　軍當然非予以再度的粉碎不可。</p>
<p>第二階段戰局　第二節目</p>
<p>右翼局面危險，共軍勢甚猖獗。　海安爲例，共軍用十二個團包圍僅及五分之一的國軍，但打了一個多星期，共軍不能動海安的一絲一毫。曲塘與大小白米則已入共軍之手。黃橋情况一度不明，現在還在附近打着。由如皋向西北至白米，向西南至黃橋的袋形地區內，流動的共軍更不在少數。泰縣和泰興外圍大小戰事不斷地進行着。</p>
<p>右翼「熱鬧」，左翼顯得沉寂。九月六日，記者在揚州搭上了行駛於揚泰路的一輛「野鷄」車，看一看這蘇北第二階段戰事的第二個節目。</p>
<p>揚泰路在目前的蘇北是一條大動脈，國軍化了不少心血把它打通而維持着。公路兩旁多的是堡壘。這些堡壘前面都染過血跡，現在雖然已看不見了，但因爲有了那些血跡而換來正在收割着豐熟的稻子的農民們的笑靨，我都一一看到了。今年蘇北是個大熟年。「靠天吃飯」的中國農民們原都應該感謝一番上帝，可是在高郵，在寶應……在那些所謂「解放區」，還有多少農民對着他們的收成在流眼淚呢！</p>
<p>朝氣普遍蓬勃　說幹就幹</p>
<p>經過一道道檢査，我到了泰縣。這是記者第二次赴泰。揚州好比半老徐娘，但泰縣就年靑得多。我感覺到的是普遍地有朝氣。丁作彬縣長是軍校十六期生，當過遊擊隊司令，一位十足的軍人。他手下的區長·鄕鎭長·自衛隊長·以至縣政府裏的秘書·科長·都和軍校與打遊擊有過關係，同過患難，現在亦正面對着患難。平日裏嘻嘻哈哈，幹起來眞有精神，挺迅速。蘇北的國軍控制的縣份中，能够和軍事配合的要稱泰縣了。修馬路，築工事，說幹就幹。工作彬在縣政府辦公室裏不能悶坐三天，他喜歡跑，到處去看。有些事須得轉轉四五道公事，擱他十天八天的，他自己下鄕，一句話就解決。</p>
<p>現在的軍人不完全是老粗，有些政治修養挺到家。工作彬有着北方人爽直熱誠的性格。泰縣的老百姓驕傲有這樣一位縣長。他說他不懂得做官，只懂得做事。他　　他的部下「沒有壞他的事</p>
<p>江南爲魚米之鄕，江北則爲鹽米之鄕，一樣的富庶，如果江南和江北有不同的情調。最顯著的或許在民性方面：江南較軟弱，江北頗强悍。强悍的民性有了組織，便是很好的地方武力。蘇北一般的感覺，地方武力不够，可是泰縣已默默地做得頗有成績。每一個鄉鎭都有了自衛隊，全縣有二千多人，一千多支槍桿，　了軍隊不少的忙。</p>
<p>這兩天，泰縣東南廿餘里，距口泰公路十八里的大泗莊受到共軍的襲擊，那兒沒有國軍駐守，自衛隊獨自抵抗着，沒有讓共軍佔到便宜。工作彬得到了報吿，親自率領了四五百名自衛隊去增援，一下子把共軍打跑了。</p>
<p>姜堰接近關綫　聽機槍聲</p>
<p>九月七日，記者隨同一〇八旅參謀長吳孝德，參謀高鴻生巡視泰縣東戰塲，工作彬亦相偕前往</p>
<p>一早出發，先到姜堰。泰姜路上，商車絕跡，軍車橫衝直撞，很快地走了卅六里路。姜堰是一個大鎭市，爲糧食集散地，往年停在這裏的運糧船，連接有三四里路長。這兒離開最前綫的馬溝，只有十里，每天晚上都可淸晰地聽到機槍聲。聽慣了，從不爲之驚擾。一家澡堂子還在大刷門面，擇吉開張，我們停留不久，便趕到馬溝去。</p>
<p>在保衛泰縣的意義上，馬溝是非常重要的據點。共軍發動攻勢以來，把泰海路截斷了。八月廿九日晚上，它糾集了二個多團乘國軍換防不久，直撲馬溝，期一舉而下，屈姜堰而脅泰縣。馬溝的守軍只有一連人，但這一連人絕不慌張，「打仗不靠人多，」他們沉着地守在工事裏，來一個打一個，來兩個打一雙。共軍把馬溝包圍了，一次次衝鋒，上來的就沒得回去。鄭亞東連長在職壕裏聽着共軍的衝鋒號，一共吹了廿次，可見那十九次衝鋒的都完了，而第廿次衝鋒的亦不能避免最後的命運，它們亦倒下了。黑夜在戰鬥中逝去，對方的槍聲寂滅。弟兄們迎着太陽發出的光芒跳出了戰壕一看：「啊！那麽多的屍體！「興奮得忘了痰倦，數一數，有三四百具。</p>
<p>我一到馬溝，鄭亞東連的弟兄搶着吿訴我這精彩的戰役。我故意掃他們的興，問道：</p>
<p>「你們死傷有多少呢？」</p>
<p>「死了一個傷了四個」。一個小兵得意地回答。</p>
<p>一比四百，或者是五比二千（共軍死傷總數），這紀鋒必使共軍咬牙不止。</p>
<p>果然，浮躁的共軍以後就每天晚上來「報仇」，但每夜都把屍體當作了禮品。</p>
<p>我們曾經立在一個堡壘上觀察地形，我問趙海雲營長：</p>
<p>「這裏距共軍前哨有多遠？」</p>
<p>「最多半里」。</p>
<p>「沒有危險嗎？」我問得十足書生氣。</p>
<p>「他們不敢——共軍是晝伏夜出的」。</p>
<p>吐出了降落傘　接濟守軍</p>
<p>回到姜堰，已是下午三時·休息了一會，我們預備回泰縣時，一架轟炸機飛臨了上空，慢慢地盤旋着，似乎尋找目標。飛機看得多了，我們毫不對它注意，突然四廂發出了驚呼聲：「丟炸彈」！人們喊着，奔着。我也吃了一驚。抬頭一望，天空中正飄着幾頂降落傘，搖搖擺擺地下降。「不像炸彈」，我直覺地想：「炸彈不該丟在這裏」。但不是炸彈，亦不該丟在這裏，我又想：「一定是飛機看錯了地方」。</p>
<p>降落傘落下的東西沒有爆炸。「飛機大槪把姜堰當做海安了。海安被困的守軍正需要物品的接濟」。我進一步想。</p>
<p>海而，飛機並不發覺錯誤，它接連地如吐蓮花似地吐出了一個個降落傘。鄕民們沒有見過這玩意兒，紛紛奔向田問去搜尋。三二四團武之棻團長命令把所有投下的東西集中到團部聽候處置。</p>
<p>薄暮時分，圍到泰縣。旅都跟空軍方面連絡，證明那批東西是接濟海安守軍的。</p>
<p>海安之圍雖尙未完全解除，其他各地的共軍雖仍在到處騷擾，但經過國軍的重新部署後，蘇北有翼的危險時期已經過去了。蘇北的軍隊和人民都有着信念。「新四軍從那裏來，把它打圓那喪去！」一個野孩子改編着歌曲唱着。中秋節到了！「月免圓圓照九洲，幾家歡樂幾家愁？」泰縣的吃食店，二天前已開始　　，準備暢渡這詩情畫意的佳節，但流亡人有家歸不得，悵對明月，不知增添了幾許新愁！</p>

<p>— 黃培英</p>
<p>用絨綫編結的衣服，穿起來，非常輕暖而舒適，所以非常風行，幾於不論誰的身上，都缺不了牠，所以編結的事業，有着廣大活動的範圍，有着很光明的前途，筆者於廿年前，即對編結事業，發生絕大興趣，當時除精研國內各種編結的方法外，並進而研究日本的編結方法，略有心得，因於民十七年，設一編結傳習所，以及編結用具，敎授新穎編結方法，當時來習者甚衆，出品非常受人歡迎，當時曾將出品陳列於工商部國貨展覽會，獲特等獎狀，及金質獎章等，嗣因手工出品，比較遲緩，乃參照日本人所用之代針機，加以發明改進，出品得比較手工快速三倍，此種代針機，經定名爲絨結代針器，曾獲國民政府工商部予以專利，得有專利執照，當時推銷甚廣，惟自抗戰軍興，此種代針器，未能繼續製造，勝利後雖經計劃製造，惟因種種關係，尙未能於年內與讀者見面，筆者於此，不能不深引爲憾。</p>
<p>但手工編結，祇須携一針一綫，隨時隨地，皆可工作，自有牠的便利處，惟式樣及結法，日新而月異，筆者擬於本刋的園地內，與讀者諸君，加以探討。</p>

<p>— 英</p>
<p>請看平劇皇后言慧珠女士，你看她穿了這件最新式的毛線衫，態度從容端莊，十分美觀大方。</p>
<p>用具：培英九號棒針二枚，縫針一枚。</p>
<p>材料：雙貓牌深紅色二絞，藍色十絞。</p>
<p>針數：每花六針。</p>
<p>編結法：起頭一六〇針，用交叉花式結法，結至六吋高。然後結一吋高深紅色一針上，一針下，此時在兩邊用練習圖十收針法，收去五十二針一邊。（爲袋口）另用二枚棒針起頭四十八針，結平針至六吋高，同樣結二塊。（爲袋裘）現在把這兩塊連在已收去的兩邊，仍用藍色同原花精去，以後在兩邊每隔半吋各减一針，共减二十二針，繼續每隔半吋在兩邊各加一針，共加三十二針，此時要收掛肩了，在兩邊每隔一行各减一針，共减四十針，繼續再每隔一行在兩邊各加一針，把减去的四十針現在加起。（但在加針時起，結有二吋高。此時在中間須收領口，在正中用針先留下三十針，現在要分開兩面結，在領口處每行再留下一針，直至掛肩處加足針數爲止。另一邊同）。</p>
<p>後身結法：起頭八十六針，在一面邊上結八針一針上，一針下，其餘仍結前身的花樣，至五吋高。繼續在不結一針上，一針下的一邊，每隔半吋减一針，共减十五針，繼續每隔半吋，在减針的一邊，加一針共加十五針，再與前身同樣收掛肩，至同樣高爲止，另一半後身結法同。（但在結八針一針上，一針下的邊上，須每隔三吋開一鈕孔，（即加一針，减一針）。前後身都結好了，用縫針把前後身，同後圖接縫法縫起。</p>
<p>領口結法：在領口週圍留下的針數，用深紅色結二吋高一針上，一針下，然後收針，把一吋高翻向反面縫住，使之成雙層。</p>
<p>掛肩邊結法：在掛肩週圍，每一孔中挑起一針，共挑一四〇針，結一吋高一針上，一針下，（用深紅色）另一邊同。</p>
<p>腰帶結法：用深紅色起頭十三針，結一針上，一針下，至二十二吋高。然後在兩邊每行减一針，减完爲止。使之成一尖端，另一條同。結完後，縫在前身兩邊腰際。</p>
<p>更有一九四六年最新式的絨線衫，他的式樣，是參考本年美國服裝樣本得來的。穿在名坤伶童芷苓女士的身民，更顯得美麗而活潑。</p>
<p>用具：培英九號棒針二枚，縫針一枚。</p>
<p>材料：變貓牌四股羊毛絨十三絞。</p>
<p>編結法：起頭一五〇針，同後面花式結法，但在兩邊每隔半吋，各减一針、共减四十針。繼續每隔半吋在兩邊各加一針，共加三十二針，此時要收掛肩，每隔一行在兩邊各减一針，共减三十二針，不减不加結四吋高爲止。</p>
<p>前身結法：起頭八十後身同樣每隔半吋减一針，共减二十針。（但結有吋高時，在不减針的一邊，先結去十六針，第十七針起結四十四針二針上，二針下，計一吋高，然後把這四十四針用練習圖十收針法，收去，此即袋口。）另用二枚針結四十四針計六吋高，然後連在收去四十四針袋口的中間，同原花結去。一邊减完了二十針，繼續每隔半針加一針，共加十六針，此時要收掛肩，換花式，收領口，在不加不减平的一面，以後每隔三行减一針，共减二十針，爲領口。（但須從第十一針减起，因爲那十針是正中的邊。花式結法參看後圖。）掛肩每隔一行减一針，共減十六針，結至與後身同樣高爲止。另一邊結法同，祇須把前面十針邊另結長五吋半，因爲後身領口上尙無邊，把這十針結有五吋半長時，就同另一邊前身上的十針縫起。其餘針數，可用後圖接縫法，把前後身縫起。</p>
<p>袖管結法：起顯五十針，仍結桂花，以後每隔一行在兩邊各加一針，共加五十針，繼續不加不減結十一吋高。然後結一行中收去四十針。（即減一針，減一針，一針下，以後類推。）使一百針剩六十針，繼續結三吋半二針上，一針下，另一袖管結法同。在縫上衣服時，如袖管上面太大，可稍微胖起一些在肩胛上。</p>
<p>腰帶結法：起頭九針，結桂花至二十八吋高。繼續每隔一行在兩邊各減一針，減完爲止。使之成一尖端。</p>
<p>衣服完全結成後，再在前身左面，照刺繡岡案，無論你喜歡那一種，都可照樣繡上，顏色的配合，也可隨心所欲。</p>
<h3 id="c127">絨綫製品的：洗濯和保存 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 培</p>
<p>絨線的特質：在未說絨線製品的洗濯法前，我們應該先知道絨線的特質，絨線的主要成分羊毛的纖維有所謂外鱗，決不能用力擦揉，若過於擦揉，毛線上的絨毛便結成塊形，失去原有的美觀。毛線類的鹹性反應很弱，洗濯時務須使用良質的胰子，不然毛線便易於變硬。假若是有色的毛線，而且洗時有脫色的可能時，在未　　先，須先用止色法止色。然後再洗。止色的方法，在一升淸水裏放單寗酸一茶匙，醋酸一茶匙混合，把要洗的東西放進去浸五六分鐘，即可洗濯。</p>
<p>洗濯的方法：洗濯的方法，最初須使塵土脫去，所以淸永洗濯。洗三四回後再放入胰子水內，上下左右推動。以後用淸永漂凈再用通酸法即可。通酸法對於絨線製品，有保護毛質的光澤和防止毛質損壞的效果，所以洗濯毛線製品，最後務須施行通酸法。通酸的方法，非常簡單，一升淸水內可放醋酸半酒盃或普通酸醋兩酒盃，作成帶酸味的水，把洗後的東西放進去浸五六分鐘，即可取出弄乾。</p>
<p>乾燥的方法：乾燥的方法不能像別的東西用力榨乾，在通酸後，取出放在平板子上使之伸平，再把形狀弄平整，然後把板子斜起來放在陰凉處陰乾，就可以保持物品原有的美麗。</p>
<p>保存的方法：至於保存的方法，最重要的是，不要讓虫蛀，不要使物品變色和變質。防虫的方法第一須將汚點完全洗凈後，再收，始能生效，同時洗濯後的東西必須充分乾燥。並須放在乾燥的地方，收藏時更應該一件件用紙分包，中間更須放上樟腦或衛生球且須用薄紙袋上，以免樟腦等的粉末裝在編縫內不容易取去。像這樣包裝完後，收在櫃子或箱子，再把箱子放在乾燥陰凉的地方，不要讓太陽直接晒着，便可以預防變色和變質。</p>
<h3 id="c128">母親的第一 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— 因果</p>
<p>十幾年來的「婦女解放」運動，確實有一部分婦女，在做着有利人羣的事，簡直不下於男人，但可惜，大部的婦女，尤其是都市裏的婦女，「解放」了以後，非但仍過着倚賴生活，甚至不願再如以前的一味屈從，而祗知享受權利，不想盡義務，更把「賢妻良母」的觀念也打破。</p>
<p>兒童是未來社會的基石，國家的棟樑，如果，要使將來的國家，社會，日臻完善，唯有極力發揮兒童敎育。</p>
<p>兒童在學校裏，所受的敎育，是機械的，並且，是有限的，敎師又不能一天到晚跟隨着學生，隨時加以敎導，所以，兒童時代的敎育，父母與敎師，應負相等責任。在學校裏，歸敎師，在家庭裏，應歸父母。尤其是做母親的，因爲，兒童與母親的接觸，較父親來得繁密，無疑的，兒童的意志，性情，都隨了母親的敎誨和訓導，而趨向了。在都市的角落裏，很容易見到，當一個母親，正醉心於呼盧喚雉，或整天的，在外面玩的時候，她們便輕易地，給孩子們錢，把看管的責任，交給傭人，或任孩子們與下流爲伍，當然，「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」，孩子便學會了一切：賭博，駡人……</p>
<p>敎養一個兒童，正似培植一枝花草，若經過一個勤勉圍丁的撫護，愛惜栽植，末了，總是欣欣向榮的，反之，若遇到一個懶散的園丁，任其日灑雨淋，也不修剪枝節，無疑的，這枝花草，總歸於枯敗。</p>
<p>試看，世界上的偉人，他們的成功，差不多都受了母親努力敎誨的影響，因爲，她們能運用觀察力，鑑別兒童的心理，把握兒童的情緒，灌輸予純正的思想，來培養他們，糾正他們。</p>
<p>固然，天下每一個母親不能把她們的孩子，都敎養成偉人，但，至少不要養成對於社會，人羣，國家，毫無用處的寄生蟲。</p>
<p>願天下的母親，負起這偉大的責任來！</p>

<p>— 憶民</p>
<p>（一）非但是薔薇這樣</p>
<p>在祖母的花園裏有一枝薔薇，已經長了蓓蕾，可是好多日子還不開花，這使我感到非常燥急，因爲我急於要看牠美麗的花瓣和顏色，我預備助牠一臂之力，叫牠開花，得到了祖母的允許，我就把牠的花瓣一片一片的展開來，最後，薔薇花好像開起來的一樣了，可是牠並不像以前看見過的那樣美麗動人，無疑的，這薔薇固有的美麗給我摧殘了，並且很快的就枯萎而死。祖母看見了，溫和的對我說道：「任何事情都是這樣的，薔薇在一定的順序一定的時間下才能生出美麗的花朵。</p>
<p>（二）籃子的敎訓</p>
<p>我們家內六個孩子時時喜歡談論別人的私事，飛短流長，損人不利己，父親很討厭我們這種壞習慣，一天他帶回來一個包裹說道：「我替你們每人買了一只小籃子，當你們有什麼事情談論的時候，把牠記錄下來，放在你們的籃子裏，籃裏放滿之後，你們把牠逐一檢視，看一下究竟有多少意義沒有。起先，我們認爲這是一種可笑的工作，可是不久，我們對於發言很謹愼從事了，再一些時候，我們把這談論別人的壞習慣簡直忘了。後來，父親解釋道：「這只小籃子做了你們的監察，現在你們不會再從學校裏，辦公室，或者工塲裏帶一些無稽之談來損害別人了，雖然，你們的籃子是空着，可是比牠滿的時候更有意思呢。</p>
<h3 id="c130">好妻子 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 鋼人譯</p>
<p>不管你怎樣想；妳是一個並不是妳所應該是的一個好妻子，如果：——</p>
<p>你吿訴你的朋友：「頂討厭了！我的丈夫他……。」</p>
<p>你在出去單獨地參加一個晚會時，要比你丈夫伴着你出去看電影時，修飾得仔細得多。</p>
<p>你是比較喜歡吿訴你的丈夫，你已多麽勞苦地工作了一天；而不喜歡吿訴他這些工作的經騐，使你增加了樂趣。</p>
<p>當你要和自己的朋友閒談時，你就把你的丈夫和家屬丟下不去照顧。</p>
<p>你在吃晚飯的時候，把那些壞消息吿訴你的丈夫，不在你知道丈夫已有了達觀的心情時才吿訴他。</p>
<p>你從不滿意你現居的屋子，常常要一些新東西，來使它更爲美觀。</p>
<p>你修飾好了你的「家」，對於朋友的贊賞，似乎比丈夫因此而得到安慰，看得更重。</p>
<p>你沒有一些興趣去款待妳丈夫的友人們。</p>
<p>你寗願自己去選自己要的禮品，不願冒這樣的「險」，就是說不定他會買給你不中意的東西。</p>
<p>你時常這樣說：「我要我的丈夫如此如此做，」不換一種方式，說：「我希望他能這樣這樣地做，如果他願意的話。」</p>
<p>你從不讓妳的丈夫得到信任，某一種意見，正是他自己的意見；直到他好好地做到了以後。</p>
<p>你對於隨便什麽事情，從不問一問丈夫的意見。（原載TheChina　Pre）</p>
<h3 id="c131">如何管理婢僕 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>凡治家主婦，對於僕婢廝養，須隨時監察，視其措施行爲，是否得當，不可略忽。監察之法，宜有常識，然後發言使命，庶幾克中繩度，俾僕曁帖然就範，無軼出常軌之舉動。下舉數端，爲主婦者應有之智識，讀者　加以揣摩，副以閱歷，得心應手，自能收指揮　意之妙矣！</p>
<p>遴選婢僕，但求勤樸無過，且須審其秉性，能服順主命與否？切勿以工資之高下爲斷，蓋誠　之僕，治事勤懇，益主非淺，宜其需索善價，若夫惰　放弛之人，偸閒好逸，或倔强難馴，工寳雖廉，得失寗足相抵。故僕之佳者，在乎克勤克儉，更須性情溫煦，無剛戾媟嫚之心，斯爲合格。反之，則管理非易，縱有長技，不宜雇用，以貽後患。</p>
<p>居家之人，衣飾服用，整潔爲上，婢僕亦然。華麗旣非所宜；而破損汚垢。則亦有失雅觀。蓋衣服垢敝，並不在貧，大半以懶惰性成，憚於洗補所致。諺曰：「一針之功，縫紉得時，足以省九針之勞。」使僕婢而不知自潔，乃冀其勤於他事，直猶緣木求魚，在勢必不可得。至於炫服靚裝，婢學夫人，亦不得謂之合式。爲之主者，宜循循善誘，敎以儲蓄，陳其利害，俾塞其奢靡之習，吿以力役所得爲數微幾。無論血汗之資，不應恣意妄耗。而食力之人，有時輟業，或則老病變患，突相侵尋，在在須得金錢爲援，茍非平素儲積，一理事發，倉卒又奚所挹。總言之，凡傭力之人，務以勤儉爲主，勿尙靡費，如衣破宜加補綴。毋遞拋棄，口腹不能縱恣。餘若購物交際，亦須隨在節制，以省財力。古語有曰：「節省一錢，即獲一錢之益」。非然者，縱慾無饜，必蹈奢侈之　，而金盡襲空，且萌非分之想，日暮途窮，失足徒悲，悔之晚矣！</p>
<p>婢僕應盡之職，事理繁多，不勝枚舉，如烹飪，洗濯，灑　，以及整理器皿，撫飼離兒。僉屬分內之事，惟烹調洗滌，各有專職，非簡舉能盡。且巨富之家，婢僕不一，每見有廚娘　婦各專其役。即或不然，而爲之主者，亦須分任其事，不能　委一人。然於灑掃　宇整潔器物之役，固爲婢僕輩通常之職，今試言之如下：</p>
<p>黎明即起，洞啓窗牗，高捲簾　，令新空氣入室，或値冬令，室有火爐，須先去爐灰及剩餘之炭屑，次乃灑掃掃。去灰之時，手法宜輕，而室中金器瓷器，與椅　壁衣之上，最好能覆以布　，以免塵灰飛集。掃地時先麗以水，亦可减經塵埃之飛揚。灑掃畢時，拂拭窗戶，凡玻璃櫃檻，以及鏡邊畫架，皆須拭抹，若有銅鋼之器，則宜以柔皮擦之，勿使生銹，苟見銹斑。須用砂紙磨挫，或塗以膠灰，必使光滑始已。他如几案椅架，一一須加揩式，母使有汚班留存，凡此諸事，舉行時刻，宜在主人未起之先，一俟主人起身，則須理寢室，爲之鋪壘茵褥，灑掃拂拭，一如前述。</p>
<p>或室中供列花瓶，及有盛水之盆，亦必按日傾換，盛以淸水。</p>
<p>每隔數日，宜取衾枕裀裯之屬，曝之陽光之中。他如灑掃樓梯，或撲擊地毯，須乘晴天，且必俟閒時爲之，勿取主人之厭。迨及晚間，則　窗鑰扉，勿怠勿忘，亦屬臧獲分也。</p>
<p>以上所論，雖但槪略，然必指導有方，乃能坐享其效，苟有錯失，亦須婉言規勸，示以恩意，使僕輩懷德來歸，庶能中心悅服。不然，雖出重資，終不能購其忠誠之心，非策之上也。</p>
<h3 id="c132">救救人爲的不幸兒童 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 陳新</p>
<p>中國有很多的不幸兒童，他們是些遭遇了天災人禍，早年失去了父母，有的被遺棄而流浪着，這些不幸的兒童，是應得到人們廣大同情的。</p>
<p>可是人們却沒有注意到除這些不幸兒童以外，更有人爲的不幸兒童。就是當兒童們的父親或母親有了外遇的時候，孩子們不幸的厄運就開始了。在目前這半封建的社會裏，做了母親的女子而再有外遇，是不太多的，而普遍的却是男子們。</p>
<p>我從前的理想，以爲健全的婚姻，一定能建立美滿的家庭，這樣新的一代也是幸福優秀的。可是現實把我的理想打破了。我親眼看到朋友親戚間，他們過去是經過長時期甜蜜的戀愛過程，彼此的性情，不能謂不瞭解，而且又同是爲社會服務的智識份子，可是結婚以後，甚至十年或二十年，到「綠　成蔭子滿支」的時候，辛勞的母親，已是年老色衰；可是父親的事業，却一步步走向了成功之路，一般見異思遷的男子，有了地位與金錢，便又弄一個小妾或外室。他們但見新人笑，那聞舊人哭，決不顧惜家庭幸福的破壞，更不會體騐或設想到孩子們所受的心理影響，因爲他們一天天和孩子們疏遠了。</p>
<p>一向受禮敎傳統的中國女子，即使是受了新思想洗禮的，她們決不肯隨便的喊出離婚，當她受了這意外的打擊，溫順的就沉默着把希望與情愛寄託在下一代，可是這受了刺激的破碎的心，有時會變態的無理的向孩子們發洩打，駡，甚至三不管，而孩子們對着這籠罩着陰霾的家庭，天眞稚弱的心靈，起着莫名的憎恨和妒嫉，他們得不到家的溫暖，更失去了偉大的父愛，小心靈是被摧殘了。</p>
<p>要是母親性情激烈暴燥的話、他一定會跟丈夫打吵，更因爲使用報復手段，會成天的在外游蕩，借着影院舞塲，來麻痺那失去了歡樂的心情。於是這「無父無母」的孩子們，衣食不週，冬餒常受，他們除了整天在弄堂胡鬧外，簡直已沒有了家，當他們偶然地能見到父母時，不是冷若氷霜的臉，就是打架，吵鬧，在這樣家庭敎育下，孩子們所得到的精神和物質的敎養，比那些無父無母的孤兒，也許更爲糟糕。</p>
<p>我們要敎養優秀的第二代，就要責成做父親的負起大部份應盡的責任，父親們該收歛起那自私的色慾，把偉大的父愛，來灌溉新生的幼苗。更希望每個女性，能尊重自己的人格，堅强你的理智，勿受男子們引誘，作人妾是不名譽的低卑的，沒有法律保障的，爲新時代女性所不齒的，更何况破壞人家的家庭，戕賊新中國的第二代，你們是在作貽害社會人羣的奸犯科呵！</p>
<p>我們要救救這些不幸的孩子們！</p>

<h3 id="c135">歌德的晚年 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 麥佛</p>
<p>湯瑪斯曼與「戀人歸來」</p>
<p>在世界文學史上，沒有再比歌德文釆煥然的巨人了。對、於中國讀者，誰都忘不了他底傑作「少年維特的煩惱」。這是一本他底自傳性的小說，出版後洛陽紙貴，不脛而走，許多失戀的少年，懷着一本「少年維持的頃惱」而自殺。</p>
<p>一七七二年的春天，正當二十二歲的華年，少年歌德驅軍去威茲勒，一個德國中部的城鎭，到帝國法院去作法律的實習。他於十六歲離開故鄉法郞克福，在萊比錫與史屈斯堡攻讀法律，其間一度患病，家居故園。在萊比錫時期，墮情於凱琴叔珂夫，在史屈斯堡時期，熱戀茀萊特麗白麗洪，旣以離別作爲結束。道些便構成了歌德初期戀愛，離別與悔恨的模型。如今歌德挾着大批的詩首，劇本，速寫與草稿抵達了威茲勒；腦袋中充滿着理想，野心與幻象；心中孕滿着眞純的熱情，反叛，與年輕的憂鬱。他正寫畢了他底第一個劇本：「馮·柏里慶」。</p>
<p>在帝國法院，歌德遇到昔日的同學開茲納，通過他，認識了他的未婚妻夏綠蒂蒲夫，她是她父親及許多兄弟姊妹的管家。相會的情形，如「少年維特的煩惱」中所寫，後來由英國幽默作家薩克萊寫打油詩道：</p>
<p>維特愛上了夏綠蒂，</p>
<p>言語從來不能表示出；</p>
<p>你要知道他第一次念應遇見</p>
<p>她？</p>
<p>她正在切着麵包和白脫。</p>
<p>可是在實生活中，那次相會</p>
<p>是在一次鄕下舞會裏，十七歲的年靑的綠蒂，穿着一件白色的衫裙，鑲着淡紅色的絲綢結。這樣他們三個：歌德，開茲納與綠蒂度過了一個牧歌式的夏季，歌德起初錘情於朋友的共同的愛情，後來終於愛上了綠蒂一個，最後却愛上自己作爲詩人與戀人的感情。秋天的時候受到了對方溫和的勸吿，他再度突然退身於到手的幸福。開茲納與綠蒂結了婚，稍後不久，威茲勒發生了一椿悲劇、另一個同學耶路沙冷，因爲單戀無望而開槍自殺。這件愚笨的事件對於歌德的影響是：他把這件事和自己近日的情緒相揉合，產生了一部小說：「少年維特的煩惱」。出版之後，全歐羅巴投入騷動之中，歌德由此成名。</p>
<p>四十四年過去了，歌德隱居在威瑪，薩克萊在他底名著「虛榮市」中又作了一首打油詩。可是此時的歌德，已是一個偉大的詩人，劇作家，小說家，政治家，科學家，愛人，樞密大臣，……他的塑像與拿壞崙悲多芬幷列；他的家屋是世界各地來進香人們必到的聖地。他從前是，而且現在也是德國最偉大的人物。他的著作浩瀚，他的全部出版的作品共有四十大卷：劇本，小說，詩，批評，——幾乎任何文學形式的都有。他寫了文學作品中最美的抒情詩，他寫了傾力一生的「浮士德」。雖然如此，他仍覺得自己沒有表現得淋漓致盡。</p>
<p>而那時候的夏綠蒂——少年維特的煩惱的女主人公——呢？正與歌德之名噪一時相反，她是默默無聞的。她替她的好丈夫生了十一個孩子；其中幾個早年夭折，如今她寡居多年。當她過子六十歲的晚年，　也率兒　女　聖地去</p>
<p>亡作家湯瑪斯曼在其名著一愛人歸來」的故事的開頭。綠蒂，六十幾歲的老寡婦，頭髮灰白，身軀肥碩，和一個近三十歲的女兒到威瑪寺。雖然面目全非，她的衣箱之中，還帶着那她初會歌德時所穿上飾粉紅綢結的自色長袍。</p>
<p>當她下了馬車，在白象旅館旅客簿上簽了姓名，立刻引起了侍役頭目馬格的注意：「難道這就是威茲勒地方的蒲夫家的夏綠蒂」？「少年維特的煩惱」他平已熟讀，今日見到書中的女主角，自然三生有幸。消息傳了出去，旅館四周擠滿了許多瞻仰風采的羣衆。</p>
<p>夏綠蒂把女兒送到妹子家去，自己寫了一封信給歌德，信中字句，她早已模擬好了：我的光榮的朋友：</p>
<p>我與女兒夏綠蒂同來探訪我的妹妹，將在威瑪小住數日。把我的女兒引見於你是我的希望，至於我自己，如果能再度獲晤昔日共遊的伴侶，如今已舉世聞名，則將欣喜莫名。</p>
<p>威瑪，白象旅店，一八一六年十月六日。</p>
<p>夏綠蒂開茲納。</p>
<p>第二天歌德設宴相邀，夏綠蒂穿了那件紅綢結的白袍，坐在歌德身旁。她說不出話來，雖然她是一個庸俗的女人，此來不過爲了要在歌德面前替妹夫說幾句帮忙話，可是在這個時候，她也說不出話來了。</p>
<p>全書九章，都十萬餘言；兩天的事，故所寫都是夏綠蒂與歌德的心理狀態。一代巨人晚年重會舊戀，便只是這麽平凡的一餐時間而已！</p>
<h3 id="c136">更夫 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 徐震</p>
<p>那寂寞的長夜，怎樣消磨呢！你問，讓我聽一下梆聲，再來向你陳述：</p>
<p>當失眠的毒蛇揭開了你的心幕，那末伴着夢者的　語，更夫是人間你最親切的朋友。</p>
<p>一盞燈描一條模糊的影，一根捧敲碎夜的死靜；忘却了「生」的慾念，把甜密敲進梆子裏；他那單純呆滯的朴聲，伸出翅膀，掃除一天星斗；巷裏的惡犬，對他彷彿也和善，知道是催人好夢的使者。但聰明人向他講解過「大我」和「小我」嗎？良心向他訴說過「自私」和「博愛」嗎？誰不愛甜夢，誰不憐憫自己？爲了誰他應得在夜中躑躅？然他終默默的背起了十字架。是人們所能知道他的原因？抑是天意所能猜測？像脫却了一切塵出的累贅，這就是命運？抑是他還想做時代的歌鼓手？</p>
<p>美滿的夢，雖爲你所珍惜，然僅供他一梆揮霍；失眠的痛苦，你雖憎恨，但終還給梆聲帶了回來。你常他是愚蠢的，但世界上誰不愚蠢呢？對於造物者的安排甚一至於自己的情感與理智。</p>
<p>在異鄕或客地，聽見了梆聲，幾疑置身家國的小樓，我愛這梆聲使你由憧憬而感到渴望，我無法接觸它，然我知道已漸漸的傍近了它。</p>
<h3 id="c137">孤女圖贊 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 謝紫</p>
<p>這兒所畫的，是一個十五六歲的她是不是一個孤兒，不過我覺得把她稱爲孤兒是很恰當的，她一定沒有父母，否則她決不會在這麽年幼的時候，就失去靑春的光耀。她並不美麗，她的表情也是呆板的，甚至於襯托着她的背影和色調，也有點偏於陰暗；可是整個看來，這幅畫却非常成功，它給我們一個很深的印象，使我們感到一種深切的悲哀。這種悲哀，凡是在惑情中生活過，在生活中反省過的人，都可以親切的體會到。並且，在我們注視着這幅畫的時候，我們的表情，也應當和這個孤女一樣，是一種茫然的悽楚。</p>
<p>她的頭髮是蓬鬆的，她的面容也非常憔悴，在她的眼睛裏可以看到一種朦朧的幽暗——她是個可憐的人。顯然的，她已經把美麗的追求放棄了；道種追求，或許在她苦難的身世中根本沒有意識到，或許是在不斷的打擊和失望中逐漸放棄了的。因爲每個女孩子，不論媸姸，總希望把自已表現得美好；而她却沒有這種希望，她面部的表情是鬆懈的，她的神彩也過於暗淡，她的限睛已經像一個飽經憂患的人，是偏於反省和內視了。這種人在我們的時代中可以說隨處皆是，可是直到我們看見了這幅畫，我們才開始驚訝：我們竟沒有深切的觀察過。</p>
<p>靑春是美好的，可是能够享受靑春的並不很多，得到靑春的人，不會意識到它；等他意識到的時候，靑春已經在苦難中蹓去了。我曾經看到過一幅畫，在水的波紋裏，隱的的畫着一個滿縐紋的女人的臉，題目是「似水流年」——似水流年，這一個只有十五六歲的女孩子，已經失去了心靈的光耀，難道在我們這苦難的時代中，十幾年的時光，竟抵過了承平時代四五十年的歲月！</p>
<p>達文西的「蒙娜莉莎」是一幅快樂的圖畫，在那兒我們看到了一種心靈的喜悅；這種喜悅幾乎是神性的。可是能够得到這種喜悅的，竟有幾人？我們每個人都有自己的夢想，在正常的生活中，我們實現了這種夢想，在拂逆的環境中，我們追求它；可是道個零丁的女孩子，她的夢想，却彷彿已經擊碎了。她一定曾在苦難中哀哀的啼哭過，在失望中在暴的怨忿過，現在，一切都風平浪靜了，她呆呆的凝視着，——這只是一種深沈的死寂。</p>
<p>我對於這幅畫的喜愛，是喜愛它的蘊藉和深刻。平常過年的時候，我們可以在市上看到許多紅紅綠綠的人物圖，這種圖畫，色彩非常誇張，人物也非常的多。對於小孩子，這是種可愛的東西，對於生長在承平時代的鄉下人，這也是非常有趣的。可是在我們看來，總覺得沒有生命，沒有內容，只是些浮在紙上的形象。然而把這裏的一幅畫打開來看一看，這兒却透露着一個苦難的時代，也透露着一種顚沛流離的生活！</p>
<p>對於一個十幾歲的女孩子，生活應該是輕鬆的，然而不然，她已經失望了。她沒有受過較高的敎育，沒有人開導她，使地把這種苦悶，轉變到一個更高理想的追求。她只希望得到一種正常的生活，一種最起點的正常生活，她只希望得到一點最平淡的溫情的培餐。然而連這一點小小的希望都不能得到，於是她失望了。這種失望，正代表着整個人類，對於生活的忍從。</p>
<p>最後我奇怪這幅畫的作者竟有這麼深刻的觀察力，她平日總是歡歡喜喜的，我以爲她一定不知道什麼是苦悶，我以爲她對於人生的認識一定是浮表的；然而我錯了，她的觀察力竟比我們深刻得多，她的表現手法又那麼純熟；這可以看出來，一個人平日的表情，不一定代表他的內心，在這複雜的時代中，生活到底是多方面的。</p>

<p>— 戴望舒</p>
<p>記得那些幸福的日子！</p>
<p>女兒，記在你幼小的心靈：</p>
<p>你童年點綴着海鳥的彩翎，</p>
<p>貝殼的珠色，潮汐的淸音，</p>
<p>山嵐的蒼翠，繁花的　錦，</p>
<p>和愛你的父母的溫存。</p>
<p>我們曾有一個安樂的家，</p>
<p>環繞着淙淙的泉水聲，</p>
<p>冬天曝着太陽，夏天籠着淸蔭，</p>
<p>白天有朋友，晚上有恬靜，</p>
<p>歲月在窗外流，不來打攪</p>
<p>屋裏終年長駐的歡欣，</p>
<p>如果人家窺見我們在燈下談笑，</p>
<p>就會覺得單爲了這也値得過一生。</p>
<p>我們曾有一個臨海的園子，</p>
<p>牠給我們滋養的番茄和金筍，</p>
<p>你爸爸讀倦了書去墾地，</p>
<p>你媽媽在太陽陰裏縫紉，</p>
<p>你呢，你在草地上追彩蝶，</p>
<p>然後在溫柔的懷裏尋溫柔的夢境。</p>
<p>人人說我們最快活，</p>
<p>也許因爲我們生活過得蠢，</p>
<p>也許因爲你媽媽溫柔又美麗，</p>
<p>也許因爲你爸爸詩句最淸新。</p>
<p>可是，女兒，道幸福是短暫的，</p>
<p>一剎時都被雲鎖烟埋；</p>
<p>你記得我們的小園臨大海，</p>
<p>從那裏你們一去就不再回來，</p>
<p>從此我對着那迢遙的天涯，</p>
<p>松樹下常常徘徊到暮靄。</p>
<p>那些絢爛的日子，像彩蝶，</p>
<p>現在枉費你摸索追尋，</p>
<p>彷彿看見你從我這間房</p>
<p>到那間，用小手揮逐陰影，</p>
<p>然後，緬想着天外的父親，</p>
<p>把疲倦的頭擱在小小的繡枕。</p>
<p>可是，記着那些幸福的日子，</p>
<p>女兒，記在你幼小的心靈：</p>
<p>你爸爸仍就會來，像往日，</p>
<p>守護你的夢，守護你的醒。</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>匆匆向鼎元吿別，帶着傳訊的三個人，回到站裏，消息仍舊沉沉。「也許在晚上發動？……也許明天？」我這麽揣測着。誰知剛在十一點半的當口，衣櫥內收音機的信號響動了。</p>
<p>「喂，老朋友嗎，午飯已經備好了，專門候着你一人哪！」</p>
<p>「好的，我這就動身了。」我答覆着</p>
<p>「午飯」或是「早點」，或是「晚餐」，或是「宵夜」等等，是我們議定了的隱語，指着日人的初步發動「動身」的意思，指着我所担任的破壞工作。</p>
<p>「六三一，六三一，總部，」我着手發動特工公用密碼電訊，收訊者是瀋陽參謀總部。不到兩分鐘，已有回音，我知道密碼已經接通，於是趕緊將預擬的電訊發出：「秘急，預定「三部曲』計劃，已迎漏，對方已有準備，〇三五支北」。我胃用天津電台的密碼。</p>
<p>這就是我同王冷齋計劃的破解方法。日人腦筋，非常拙笨，心胸十分狹窄，而又多疑；因此，一有秘密計劃，最怕聽到「洩漏」兩個字。設若一旦聽說洩漏了，不問眞假，必定手忙脚亂，大起騷動；甚至把全盤計劃，完全推翻。我所計劃的破解方式，就是根據這個心理擬定的。</p>
<p>照我的推測，總部收到這條急電之後，必定立刻下令，吩咐北平特工機構，停止預期的動作，或臨時改變方式，取消的會。</p>
<p>果然，約莫一小時光景，我們總部的同志已有　電，說總部首腦收到急電後，十分憤怒，痛駡北平的特工主持人，及軍政活動領領導們，說他們簡直都是渾蛋，連這種重要的計劃，都被洩漏出去。洩漏的責任，都放在松井一人身上。這傢伙就是上次伴送我回長辛店的笨虫。</p>
<p>然而您要說他眞是一條笨虫，却又不然。傍晚六點鐘左右，我們收到了情報，知道這傢伙下午仍舊不動聲色，按照約定的時刻帶着今井等幾個亡命之徒，和十多名射擊好手，一擁而至進德社北平冀察委員長行轅，一方面要試探行轅裏究竟有多少力量的準備，一面仍舊打算蠻幹一下。意思設若弄倒幾個，也可將功折罪。</p>
<p>誰知到了行轅裏，一進門，全部射手都被攔下，名雖請他們在休息室裏用茶，實則被衛隊室裏二十餘名彪形大漢監視住了。然而松井這傢伙，仍不死心，仍舊和今井等帶着三五個隨員，衝到客室裏，指名定要宋哲元親行接見。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>街頭巷尾，出租出售迎環圖畫的攤頭甚多，在每一座攤頭，往往都簇擁着一羣兒童，其年齡自八九歲以二至十歲，甚至還有許多成人婦女，有人曾喩爲街頭敎育，然而這種敎育是危險的。</p>
<p>危險是在於這些連環圖畫的故事內容。</p>
<p>這一說法是有根據的，最近最近就有一個例子：</p>
<p>二十二日早晨五時北京路發生一件胞弟殺兄嫂的血案，　兇手之妹稱：兇手平時歡喜看連環圖畫，其臨行兇之夕，尙在看「翠屛山」一書，不料竟效石秀殺起兄嫂來，所以或係中了連環圖畫的毒。</p>
<p>連環圖畫的故事內容，大抵不出奸淫盜賊和神怪三類，因爲是用圖畫表現的，而且取費甚廉，發行廣泛，因之便更普及火衆深入民間，這對於社會的影響太大了。</p>
<p>爲救救兒童着想，當局是應該積極予以取締的。</p>
<p>我曾經和有關當局談過這個問題，據他們說，他們也早就注意到了，但在取締時，道些書的出版者却很理直氣壯地拿出內政部登記核准印行的執照來，使我們倒感到相當狼狽。</p>
<p>倘使以上是事實，我們除請本市主管當局據實呈報外，並請內政部澈底査究一下，究竟這些含有毒素的書刋，憑什麼能發給准許證？是什麽人在承辦此事？其中有無其他情事。</p>
<p>自然，我們也更希望那些出版家們別昧着天良在賺這筆殺人的血腥錢！</p>

<h3 id="c142">總有一天到月球 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 大維</p>
<p>（編者按：當一　科學均爲戰爭而準備的今日，我們極希望科學家們能够將研究原子彈及細菌戰的興趣移到對月亮的研究上去！）</p>
<p>肉眼看來，滿月只是一隻亮盤子，上面有斑駁的黑影。這乃是這個衛星的表面：有沙漠，平原，山嶺，火山石，山谷和噴火口。地球上大部常見的東西都在上面，只是那裏沒有湖泊，海洋和生物。</p>
<p>天文家曾將月球表面仔細精確的畫了圖。他們對於上面的裂口，火山石，山谷，平原等知道的比地理學家對於地球上隱僻的地方還要詳細。</p>
<p>他們也知道月球上面的情形。那裏從白日到夜間氣溫高低相差很大。月球上的白天，等於地球上的兩星期，太陽直射表面，並無像地球上的空氣層阻隔，結果，日中時石頭熱到可以燒開水，只有洞穴或崖壁的陰影下，才是黑暗的，人類才可在那裏生活。</p>
<p>月球上的夜間也是兩星期，表面的熱很快的放射到空中，氣溫可能低到任何液體凍結。</p>
<p>比任何困難都嚴重的是上面沒有空氣，一個人從地球到月球上，倘毫無預防的話，很容易的因體內空氣壓力而爆炸，就像有些深水魚從海底出來太快時一樣</p>
<p>要克服這些危險，月球探險家應應當有特別的奘備。他們需要「月亮衣服」，一種設計週到，完全關閉而能動的護體，須能像潛水衣一樣可以供給同氣壓的空氣，並具有其他使人在月球上能够生存的必須設備，像溫度控制器及電力操縱的器械。</p>
<p>一件衣服重七百磅</p>
<p>這樣一件笨重衣服在地球上是不能用的。然而在月球上的地心吸力差不多僅有地球的五分之一·一百八十磅的男子到了月球上只有三十五磅，一件在地上七百磅的衣服就只有一百四十磅了。爲了保護人，這件衣服須要沉重，使他可以保持平衡，控制肌肉。</p>
<p>這件七百磅的衣服說不定會成什麽樣子，牠應當具有每方吋能忍受十五磅內在壓力的力量。而又須柔軟使穿着的人容易移動。　須有自己的動力機械——也許是爲了適應月球上日間的日光發電機和夜間用的貯電池。牠的空氣調節器必須能够不斷的將呼出的空氣重新製造，裝進新鮮氧氣，再放入循環供給器。牠或許必須能抽出空氣中呼出的以及身體蒸發的濕氣，淸潔後再供應用，因爲水和空氣都必須從地球帶去</p>
<p>這件月亮衣服還須有內部及外部的發光器，以備在月球的夜間應用；還須有熱的絕緣體，發熱及冷却器的裝置以備日夜之需。馬達和管制操縱「手臂」，「手指」及其他表面工作器械的裝置以及無綫電和雷達器械都是爲着交通，指示方向及畫圖的。此外，須有食物貯藏處以備探險者離開基地時所用，其餘如對於健康，舒適及便利工作的裝置也是必須的。</p>
<p>如果這種服裝可以製造（好像沒有什麽理由不可以），那麽聰明有決心的探險家們不但可以在短期內生存，並且可以在月球上澈底的考察一下。</p>
<p>能够作此種月球旅行的火箭馬達，至少須比現在所有的兩倍效能。空中火前須有一秒鐘七哩的驚人速度，物理學家稱之爲地球的「解放速度」。這就是說，一且火箭達到此等速度，馬達可以關掉，而火箭可能因動力由地球發出。假使瞄得準確，可以射到月亮上。</p>
<p>什麽時間遠征月球</p>
<p>月球遠征隊到達月亮的最好的時間是月球的早晨，這樣探險家可以有兩星期的日光，使他們一切的裝備和生活適應當地的環境。他們降落後的第一件事應當，是將火箭裝好以備回來之用。他們可以輪流出去考査。駕駛員應該駐守在基地，和出去的隊員及地上聯絡。地質學家和礦物學家出去探求寶貴的金屬及礦物，硏究殖民的可能性，帶回月亮上的石頭作更進一步的研究。</p>
<p>考査結果應當立刻報吿給地球站，以免任何意外發生使遠征隊不能回來。</p>

<p>— 黎心</p>
<p>〔編者按：本刋在八月三十日登了一篇芝薇先生的「我的理想夫人」，提出對於他未來太太的條件後，許多讀者響應這一問題，也有囑將信件轉與芝薇君的；足見靑年朋友們對婚姻問題的迫切興趣。這里僅將來函中擇其一二，發表如下，也許對於在愛情十字路口徘徊的靑年有所參考。〕</p>
<p>人到了相當的年齡，選擇終身伴侶是一件重要的事；但，每個人各有不同的理想。</p>
<p>我認爲，理想中的丈夫應具備下列各點：</p>
<p>容貌端正，服裝整潔，但不必過份修飾；不崇尙時貌，一窩風的去買玻璃褲帶等貨品。這是儀表上的美。</p>
<p>唔「烟」「酒」「嫖」「賭」等惡習慣；要求「智」「體」「德」「　」各育的增進。這是天性上的美。</p>
<p>身體强健，精神活潑，沒有可能遺傳及傳染的病症。這是生理上的美。</p>
<p>知識優良，至少須受十二年以上的敎育；勇於服務，有捨己爲人的精神，要有明確的判斷力和獨立的思想。這是知識和行爲上的美。</p>
<p>「理想的丈夫」方能娶到「理想的妻子」，你認爲對嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c144">不是買東西 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 笑薇</p>
<p>我嘆息這人世間人性「自我心」的過强，　引起一切大小的衝突　　　的戰鬥，各有各的一套八股，都要使世界都去跟隨它去符合它，激烈的主義者，更不惜以流血手段，使世界一下子去符合它，結果，反使人類未享其福先受其苦。對於婚姻問題我深感關切，但雙方一定要開出如何如何的條件，我是反對的。擇偶固不能亂來，但却不全像買東西。</p>
<h3 id="c145">一封自荐信 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 徐也野</p>
<p>芝薇先生：</p>
<p>這次不知怎的，竟下了決心寫這封信來，在封建色彩尙濃的山城裏，此舉似近子荒唐，唯其如此，請先生不可輕視了。</p>
<p>自我介紹：</p>
<p>我是專科學校畢業的，我愛我的工作，我忘不了學習，務使自己多了解一點自己時代需要。</p>
<p>我只敢說在我的小生活圈內遇事尙可平心靜氣去處理。</p>
<p>對於「眞，善，美」三字，先生願加詳解嗎？生活要怎樣才能踏上「眞，善，美」的境地呢，然而不管這些，我要使生活單純，柔和，無濃艶之感？</p>
<p>我的面孔很平常呢！先生，我們這裏的女人都是十分樸素，比先生的五，六，七條理想，還要樸素，自然我也不能例外。</p>
<p>小家庭或可料理得好。</p>
<p>旅行是我唯一的愛好。</p>
<p>根據上面幾點，無論與你有無多大相違之處，我總希望能同先生做異地異性的朋友。我沒有去過熱鬧的都市，尤其是號爲天上人間的上海。我很想在先生那裏認識。我對先生雖無貢獻，但能時時報吿一些繁華塲所中所沒有的</p>

<p>— 喬治</p>
<p>「短衫赤脚，手持鋤耙，剪草澆花，悠然自得。」</p>
<p>「余生也晚忽耆年，閱書滄桑海已田，調鼎鹽梅慚　理，同根箕豆怯燃煎，南華夢幻迷莊蝶，西域風雲唳杜鵑，且喜秋高人老健，不知不識順其大。」</p>
<p>以上是司法院長居正先生在十一年前所撰「六十自　詩」中的一節，目前正値秋高氣爽，我們的居先生也是老而益健，詩句內容，和當前環境依售吻合。下月的二十日，便是居先生的七秩晋一大慶，稱觴賦句之時，重讀舊作。必多感喟吧。</p>
<p>院長在平房里</p>
<p>我稱居先生爲平民院長，因爲他雖貴爲院長，私生活却無異尋常百姓，戰前他在首都和平門附近築有一所佔地十一畝的居處，在這樣廣大的地面上，却只搭蓋低矮的平房幾間，較之其他顯要們巍峨高崇的洋房，眞有雲泥之別。當時地價屋價，一共祇有七千元。每當夕陽西沉，這所屋內，常有一個短衫赤脚，頭戴草笠的老農人，手持鋤耙，剪草澆花，臉上顯出悠然自得的神態，說來恐怕不易使人置信，這個老農就是堂堂的居院長。</p>
<p>居氏不僅喜歡農夫的生活，而且還自命爲澳人，二十五年六月十四日。他曾偕同夫人來滬寄住新亞酒店，登記册上的是假姓名，職業項下更塡註了「農人」兩個字。</p>
<p>深懂生活藝術</p>
<p>他厭見生客，但是却高興寫字，向他求書，不論熟魏生張，一律應酬。他愛學習騎馬，他嗜食的東西是：豆腐。</p>
<p>居先生是湖北廣濟人，字覺生，幼年曾留學日本。提到日本，居氏和她之問，有一段佳話：當孫總理在海外奔走革命的時候，居先生隨從寄居東瀛，爲了居夫人——鍾女士，寶同籍——生育　密，而居氏奔走國事，頗以兒女成行爲累，有一個日本朋友萱野長知，願意替他撫養一位女公子，從此居小姐受日本家庭的撫養，受日本敎育的薰陶，忽忽二十年之久，居氏爲國馳驅，竟將此事擱諸腦後，直到民國二十五年六月，居小姐從養父萱野口中得知自己的身世，方才回國，骨肉團圓，眞有說不出的悲喜交集。</p>
<p>居先生現有一子三女、長女即爲早歲寄居日本的萱野長子，已下嫁張銘君爲妻。公子名浩然，畢業淸華大學及中央軍校，現在軍界供職，抗戰時曾參加前綫作戰。</p>
<p>我們要平民官居院長，人們對他的第一個印象是：「生活在平民一起」；我們今後所需要的「官」也就是這一類的官。如果說我們對居院長特別有好感的話，唯一的原因就是因爲「他平民化」。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Excited and Enthusiastic Crowd of Hundreds of Thousands; Nanchang Grand Meeting Welcomes Head of State; Chairman Delivers Address Urging Construction of a New Jiangxi <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 23rd] Chairman Chiang may depart Nanchang on the 24th. It is rumored he will first go to Ganzhou, then fly to Guangdong for an inspection tour before returning to Nanjing within the week.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Reliable sources indicate that this is Chairman Chiang's first visit to Jiangxi since the victory. He is deeply moved by the enthusiastic welcome of the Jiangxi people and plans to stay slightly longer, possibly delaying his return to Nanjing by a few days.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 23rd] The Jiangxi Provincial Capital's Grand Meeting to Welcome the Head of State, combined with an Enlarged Memorial Week, was held at 9:00 AM on the 23rd at the Nanchang Sports Field. Over two hundred units participated, with a crowd of up to 100,000 people. Over eight thousand demobilized officers from the Sixth Army Officer Corps also marched to the meeting, causing the meeting grounds and the Huanhu Road outside to be packed with welcoming crowds. However, the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely solemn and enthusiastic. As the bell tolled nine times, the composed and benevolent Chairman Chiang arrived by car. The entire audience stood at attention and welcomed him with applause. After the meeting began, led by Chairman Chiang, formalities were observed. First, Ouyang Wu, a 66-year-old respected elder, and Xu Ronggui, a 71-year-old farmer representative, presented a banner with the words "Eternal Loyalty to All Nations" to the Chairman on behalf of all sectors. The Chairman accepted it with a smile, repeatedly saying, "Thank you." Then, Xu Xiangxiang, representing the Youth League, presented a commemorative album with the signatures of 1,500 members. After the flag and commemorative album presentations, the Chairman delivered an address, urging everyone to work diligently and build a new Jiangxi [original text follows]. The address lasted forty-five minutes, and the crowd responded with enthusiastic applause, accepting his words of consolation and virtue. The meeting concluded with cheers of "Long live the Head of State," "Obey the Head of State," "Long live the Kuomintang of China," "Long live the Republic of China," and "Long live the Head of State." Amidst the cheers and music, the Head of State stepped out of the meeting grounds, repeatedly waving to thank the crowd for their respect. He then boarded his car and returned to the official residence.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Chairman's Address</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 23rd] The following is the original text of Chairman Chiang's address delivered at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, at the Grand Meeting to Welcome the Head of State held by all sectors of Jiangxi Province!</p>
<p>Chairman Wang, elders and compatriots of all circles in Jiangxi, fellow military officers, and young people, today, after the victory of the War of Resistance, I, Zhongzheng, have come to Nanchang to meet with you, the elders and compatriots of all circles in Jiangxi. This is truly the most memorable, happiest, and most self-satisfying day of my life.</p>
<p>Great Contributions</p>
<p>Most of you elders and compatriots here today still remember that in the 15th year of the Republic [1926], I led the National Revolutionary Army on the Northern Expedition from Guangdong. After passing through Changsha, we quickly defeated the warlords in Jiangxi and recaptured Nanchang. Therefore, Nanchang was our first base for the Northern Expedition's advance. At the same time, all the men, women, old, and young compatriots in Jiangxi supported the National Government and were loyal to the National Revolution. Their contribution to the Northern Expedition was truly great. It can be said that the reason why the Northern Expedition was completed so quickly was largely due to the whole province of Jiangxi contributing money and effort, sincerely supporting it. This is a major event that I have never forgotten in the past twenty years. From the 20th year of the Republic [1931] to the 23rd year [1934], the entire province of Jiangxi was mired in long-term banditry. It can be said that there was no clean land in Jiangxi at that time. The lives of the compatriots were truly as deep as water and as hot as fire. When I first arrived in Nanchang, the general public's fear of bandits was almost worse than fear of floods or wild beasts. During this period, the total number of compatriots in Jiangxi who sacrificed their lives due to banditry was at least five million. As for the loss of property, it was even more immeasurable. However, since the implementation of the New Life Movement in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], the fear of bandits has been completely changed. At that time, every man, woman, old, and young in Jiangxi was not only unafraid of bandits, but also deeply hated the inhuman acts of killing and arson committed by bandits. No matter what kind of difficulties and hardships we Jiangxi compatriots encountered, whether they were displaced or wandering, their loyalty to the government and their support for the revolution remained steadfast. From the beginning to the end, they believed in the government, obeyed orders, and worked together to avenge the bandits. Therefore, in less than two years, that滔天大禍 [lit. "滔天的大鍋 a huge disaster"] was extinguished. By the winter of the 23rd year [1934], social order had gradually stabilized. From this, it can be seen that we Jiangxi compatriots all have the enthusiasm for revolution, are able to protect their hometown and country, love their country and themselves, and truly deserve to be called modern citizens. Unfortunately, in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the Japanese寇 [lit. "bandits" - a pejorative term for the Japanese] launched the Lugouqiao Incident, and our China launched a full-scale War of Resistance. During the eight years, the comrades and compatriots of the entire Jiangxi province, under the leadership of the government, obeyed orders and consistently fought to the death with the enemy. From this, it can be seen that Jiangxi has made even greater contributions to the victory of the War of Resistance. As you all remember, our national policy of resisting Japan and all subsequent plans for the War of Resistance were decided in Lushan, Jiangxi. It can be said that Jiangxi is the birthplace of the victory of the War of Resistance. In short, Jiangxi has made indelible contributions to the development of the National Revolution in the past twenty years. It occupies the most glorious page in the history of the Chinese Revolution. We, the compatriots of the entire province, must unanimously cherish, promote, and carry forward this historical glory, so that it will last forever.</p>
<p>Using the Spirit of the New Life Movement to Build Jiangxi into a Model Province</p>
<p>However, this time when I came to Jiangxi, it happened to be after a long period of the War of Resistance, and the local area was devastated and the people were suffering. I cannot help but feel sad and worried. However, based on past experience, I am confident that the spirit of construction and the power of recovery of our Jiangxi compatriots are no less than those of any province in China. From the 19th year of the Republic [1930], Jiangxi experienced six years of long-term banditry, but by the time the banditry was suppressed in the 24th year [1935], not only did social order quickly recover, but also all sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce had a thriving atmosphere. In particular, the construction undertaking was advancing rapidly. Within just two years, from the 24th year [1935] to the 26th year [1937], the Gan-Zhe and Gan-Xiang railways were completed, all the main highways of the province were completed, and this Ganjiang Bridge was built. Other educational and economic constructions are even more numerous to mention. This great construction power is something we should particularly encourage and develop. I believe that if the Jiangxi compatriots can work together diligently under the leadership of the provincial government, as in the past, then within three years, Jiangxi Province will definitely be built into a national model province.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, there is one more point that I want to bring to the attention of all of you: The main reason why we Jiangxi were able to achieve such great achievements in the past in the revolution, the War of Resistance, and the suppression of bandits was because we had a spiritual strength. What is this spiritual strength? It is the New Life Movement that I advocated in Nanchang on February 19th of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933]. The essence of this movement is to incorporate the four cardinal principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame into the daily lives of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and to achieve the goal of improving the national spirit and promoting national morality through the reform of daily life. This movement also originated in your Jiangxi, and later was widely promoted to the whole country. I believe that this movement has had the greatest impact on the success of suppressing bandits at that time and the victory of the War of Resistance today. In the future, the work of nation-building will be even more arduous than the past War of Resistance. Therefore, I hope even more that our Jiangxi compatriots will follow the spirit of the era when we first implemented the New Life Movement, understand propriety and righteousness, know integrity and shame, be responsible, abide by discipline, be diligent and hardworking, and work hard to complete the construction of our new Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Helping Demobilized Military Officers to Continue Efforts in Nation-Building</p>
<p>Finally, when I came to Nanchang, I also saw that the students of our Officer Corps were welcomed and cared for by the general compatriots, and they were loving and sincere to each other, helping each other and cooperating with each other. I felt very gratified in my heart. As you all know, in the past twenty years, all officers and soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army have been sacrificing and fighting hard all the time. It can be said that they have not had a day of peace following my command. After the Northern Expedition, they continued with the suppression of bandits. After the suppression of bandits, they continued with the War of Resistance. Their merits and achievements deserve the love and respect of compatriots throughout the country and should be remembered forever. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance, more than 150,000 officers retired under the order of the government, abandoning their existing military positions and sacrificing their lofty status. This major event can be said to be an unprecedented feat in Chinese history. This is the greatest progress in Chinese politics and military affairs, and it is also the highest expression of the patriotic personality and revolutionary spirit of all Chinese soldiers. This proves that today's truly patriotic and people-loving troops and officers have no selfish or self-interested concepts, only a pure and bright heart, loyal to the country and caring for their compatriots. Therefore, our compatriots must continue to love, help, and support these national military officers who obey orders and sacrifice themselves, with the spirit of supporting the government and loving the National Revolutionary Army in the past twenty years, so that they can continue to serve the country and participate in the work of nation-building after ending their military life. Only in this way can we express the utmost sincerity of our general compatriots in respecting virtue and rewarding merit. Our military officers and compatriots must cherish themselves, be diligent, and be law-abiding, so as to be a model for society and a model for the people, so that they can truly complete the mission of the National Revolutionary Army in resisting Japan and building the nation.</p>
<p>Today, I, Zhongzheng, am meeting with the elders and compatriots of Jiangxi, and I feel extremely happy in my heart. There is no other way to express my gratitude and consolation except with a heart full of enthusiasm and sincerity. I am willing to encourage each other with my Jiangxi compatriots to strive for the construction of a new Jiangxi and a new China. I wish all Jiangxi compatriots health and progress.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chairman Holds Tea Party to Entertain Guests; Receives Director Cai to Instruct on Relief Work <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 23rd] Chairman Chiang held a tea party to entertain Chinese and foreign guests at the Provincial Government Auditorium at 4:30 PM on the 23rd. Those who attended included Duncan, the UNRRA representative in Jiangxi, Schmidt, the head of the Catholic Church, Gao Suifu, the Christian pastor, Peng Chengwan and Ouyang Wu, local gentry, and Zhou Lingyuan and Hu Dexin, descendants of the late military commanders Zhou Hunyuan and Hu Zuyu, totaling over a hundred people. During the tea party, the Chairman stood up and gave a speech, repeatedly expressing his concerns about the construction of Jiangxi. He briefly stated that construction must proceed from small to large, from near to far. The construction of Jiangxi should start from Nanchang, and the construction of the whole country should start from Jiangxi. Jiangxi has a glorious past culture, intelligent people, and superior material conditions. If it can be supplemented by modern scientific organization and other technologies, the construction achievements will definitely advance rapidly. Finally, the Chairman encouraged all parties in Jiangxi, including the party, government, and military, to work together diligently under the leadership of Chairman Wang. He believed that within three to five years, Jiangxi could definitely become a national model province. The Chairman praised the work of UNRRA and hoped that everyone would emulate the work spirit and methods of Westerners. After the speech, the entire audience applauded unanimously. The tea party ended at about 6:00 PM in joy.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chiang received Cai Mengjian, the Director of the UNRRA Jiangxi Branch, on the 23rd and gave detailed instructions on relief work. Also, during the tea party on the 23rd, the Chairman greatly praised the work spirit of Duncan, the UNRRA representative in Jiangxi, and his foreign staff, as well as their close cooperation with the UNRRA Branch. He also stated that farmland water conservancy is very important and should be strengthened.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Zhang Lisheng Talks to Our Reporter About the Government's Attitude Towards the Current Situation; Judging Facts Rationally and Awaiting Results Patiently <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] When Zhang Lisheng answered our reporter's inquiry about discussing the situation on the 23rd, he briefly stated that although peace talks are currently stalled, all parties are still in constant contact. We should judge facts rationally and await results patiently, and believe that there is still hope for success.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] At 11:00 AM, Situ Lei's personal advisor, Fu Jingbo, talked with the visiting Pi Zonggan for about 45 minutes. There were no other activities. According to observations from various parties, it seems that everyone is waiting for Chairman Chiang to return to Nanjing before any progress can be made. A spokesperson for the Communist Party delegation said tonight that Mr. Zhou Enlai is in Shanghai waiting for news. As soon as the Military Mediation Group meeting is scheduled, Zhou will immediately return to Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Wu Tiecheng and Four Others Held a Discussion Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] During the political negotiation process, after the Communist Party submitted the second memorandum yesterday, government representatives still had contact with each other today, except for the Communist Party representatives who did not travel back and forth, showing that while waiting for the Chairman to return to Nanjing, the government side still wanted to find appropriate ways to achieve peace. After the KMT memorial week on the morning of the 23rd, Wu Dingfu, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Peng Xuepei, and Wang Shijie held a discussion meeting to discuss the current situation. At noon, Wu Tiecheng went to General Chen's residence on Putuo Road and talked with Chen for a long time, and had lunch together. Many believe that the government representatives are studying the requests made in the Communist Party's memorandum. It is also heard that Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Yu Dawei, and others will dine at the US Embassy on the evening of the 24th to discuss the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Ambassador Marshall Discusses General Issues with Yu Dawei <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall received Yu Dawei at his residence at 8:45 AM on the 23rd and talked until 11:50 AM. According to Yu, they were still discussing general issues of the current situation, but many believe that they were studying the contents of the Communist Party's memorandum. The main purpose of the memorandum is to convene the Military Mediation Group meeting. Yu is the representative of Xu Yongchang, the government representative in the Military Mediation Group.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] The efforts of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have temporarily stalled. Reliable sources say that Marshall and Stuart do not intend to launch mediation again for the time being. It is expected that the stalemate will not change in any way before Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing. Marshall does not intend to respond to the memorandum submitted by the Communist Party before exchanging views with Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Our Country Signs the International Monetary Fund; Exchange Rate Changes Are Restricted; Economic Experts Discuss Currency Depreciation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] Although the official solemnly declared that the exchange rate would never change, the foreign exchange market in Nanjing still changed according to the Shanghai market. Today's black market rate was 3,550 法幣 [legal tender] per US dollar, and large bills could only get 3,400 法幣 [legal tender]. It seems that those who deal in US dollars generally expect the price to rise. According to an economic expert who has a close relationship with China's monetary system, China is a signatory to the International Monetary Fund. The Fund stipulated a month ago that each member state should register its permanent stable exchange rate of its currency against major gold standard currencies (i.e., US dollars, British pounds, and French francs) with the Fund within three months of issuing the final notice. The purpose is to prevent any significant devaluation of each country's currency before the specified deadline. After the deadline is reached, China and every other signatory country will be bound by its registered exchange rate. If the domestic situation requires the currency to be devalued again, the value of the devaluation must not exceed one-tenth, and this adjustment must be implemented at least six months after registration. Responsible observers know that a 13% readjustment is not enough to cope with the devaluation that may occur frequently. Therefore, it is necessary to announce a final devaluation once again within two months. If, unfortunately, the situation continues to deteriorate after this devaluation, China still has the right to withdraw the devaluation restriction from the International Monetary Fund, but this move is tantamount to declaring national bankruptcy to the world, which no country would be willing to do.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 23rd] After rumors in Shanghai that the official exchange rate of 法幣 [legal tender] against the US dollar would be adjusted again, the market price of the US dollar in the open market here has reached a new peak. As of now, the highest price is 3,610 法幣 [legal tender].</p>
<h3 id="e7">The Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway Will Be Open to Traffic Tomorrow <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The railway between Kaifeng and Xuzhou in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway was severely damaged by the 共軍 [Communist forces]. Military conditions have improved recently, and the repair work on this section has progressed very rapidly. Within a week, the entire 194-li damaged section has been repaired. The Ministry of Communications received a call from Xuzhou on the 23rd that the road will be open to traffic on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] It is reported that the transportation authorities are considering extending the western section of the Longhai Railway to Lanzhou and have sent experts to Tianshui for field research. After the westward expansion of the railway line, it will be very beneficial to the development of the Yumen oil mine and the consolidation of the northwest border defense.</p>

<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 23rd] The battle for Zhangjiakou is imminent. Important consultations were held by the military authorities in Peiping tonight. Fu Zuoyi, commander of the Twelfth War Area, flew from Suiyuan to Peiping on a special plane today, arriving here at noon. There has been no news of war on the Qinghuangdao [Qinhuangdao] side of the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway. The war in eastern Suiyuan and northern Shanxi has gradually passed. 聂荣臻 [Nie Rongzhen]'s troops, 13,000 strong, have fled from Datong along the Peiping-Suiyuan line to Yanggao. 萧克 [Xiao Ke]'s troops and 葉寧 [Ye Ning]'s troops withdrew in a straight line to Zhangjiakou. Communist troops, 2,000 strong, have infiltrated from Xinglong and Deqing in the southwest, attempting to threaten the flank of the National Army and destroy communications.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 23rd] It is certain that the National Army will launch a three-pronged attack on Zhangjiakou. The steps will be decided tonight and the advance will officially begin. The Eleventh War Area Command in Peiping will hold an important military meeting tonight to echo the First War Area. Other important military commanders are scheduled to fly to Peiping this afternoon to participate in this meeting. Also, the security team of the Chahar Provincial Government stationed in Nankou has received notification and will advance with the army tonight.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 23rd] It is certain that the Kangzhuang area on the left and right front of the first line of defense of the Communist Army in eastern Chahar has been in frequent contact with the National Army since yesterday. Several small strongholds have been taken over by the National Army. This is the prelude to the National Army's official advance. Kangzhuang is now within range of the National Army's artillery, and once the battle begins, it can be quickly captured. It is heard that the new tactics adopted by the National Army in the future will be to make the Communist Army in important strongholds retreat on their own. Also, Xiaogezhuang, 13 kilometers west of Shunyi on the Peiping-Gubei line, was captured by four regiments of Communist troops transferred from eastern Hebei last night. The battle was quite fierce. The National Army is now counterattacking. The actions of this Communist force seem to be aimed at containing the advance of the National Army on the Peiping-Suiyuan Road and threatening the Peiping-Gubei Road.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 23rd] The newly recovered routes are being actively repaired. The western section of the Peiping-Suiyuan Road has been opened to Fengzhen and will be opened to Datong within days. The Peiping-Gubei line has been repaired to near Shixia. Also, the tracks between Tangshan and Kaiping on the Peiping-Ningbo Road were blown up by a landmine this morning and were quickly repaired.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Zhangjiakou, 22nd] The rumor that the airfield here has been destroyed is not true. A plane from the Peiping Executive Headquarters landed safely here today and carried away a radio operator from the government group because he was suffering from tonsillitis, which was quite serious.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Zhangjiakou, 22nd] Except for one air raid alarm every day, there are no visible signs of tension on the surface. Most residents are still living their normal and peaceful lives. A government offensive against Zhangjiakou seems imminent.</p>
<h3 id="e10">A Great Feat in History: 150,000 Men Lay Down Their Armor; Soldiers Are Truly Fine Men; Chairman Praises the Sixth Officer Corps <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 23rd] At the grand meeting in Nanchang, the provincial capital, to welcome the Head of State on the morning of the 23rd, Chairman Chiang, after comforting the people of Jiangxi, publicly praised the Sixth Officer Corps for its great achievements. He expressed great satisfaction with the unity and close cooperation between the more than 10,000 surplus officers of the corps and the 200,000 citizens of Nanchang, which had been well received by all parties. At this point, the Chairman, in a moving speech, especially mentioned that after the victory, the government, in accordance with its established policy, reorganized the national army to complete the major task of military demobilization. After an order was issued, the work of streamlining the army immediately took effect. To date, at least 150,000 officers have obeyed the order to retire and enter various officer corps to receive various retraining suitable for national reconstruction needs. This is a great feat unprecedented in history (loud applause). The soldiers of the Republic of China are all aware of the importance of today's national reconstruction mission. Our national reconstruction work, once completed, can be completed (loud applause from 100,000 people in the entire venue). This is indeed a rare miracle in the five thousand years of our Chinese nation.</p>
<p>When this reporter visited the Qingyunpu Sixth Officer Corps on the 13th of this month to inquire about the vocational training of the major detachments under the corps, the teaching guidelines for retraining, the retraining aspirations and numbers of various officers, the morale of the surplus officers entering the corps for training, the views of the surplus officers on the future of the country, and the ideas of the surplus officers on their own prospects, the reporter could not help but say to his colleagues that the government's plan for retraining surplus officers, formulated in order to thoroughly implement the major task of military demobilization, is unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. Compared with the backward thinking of "releasing military power with a cup of wine and dividing the land to enfeoff vassals" in the Han and Tang dynasties, it is truly a million times more brilliant and five thousand years more advanced. Our 450 million compatriots should not just verbally support the Head of State and obey the Head of State, but should experience the Head of State's painstaking efforts and virtues from the Head of State's invented major plans for saving the country and building the country, and support the Head of State's research and development of a major plan for streamlining the army and demobilizing soldiers that is more courageous than the Han and Tang dynasties and wiser than Europe and the United States. This is because Emperor Gaozu of Han and Emperor Taizong of Tang did not have retraining and resettlement measures for demobilizing soldiers, while Europe and the United States had demobilization measures but no retraining. Enhance the martial virtues of the Chinese nation to solve the most dangerous and troublesome problem of reducing troops in the five thousand years of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang was very happy to hear and see everything about the retraining of our country's officers after coming to Nanchang this time. He personally comforted General Chen Pei, the commander of the Sixth Officer Corps, and the three deputy commanders and seven battalion commanders for their efforts to solve the difficulties of various surplus officers. If the surplus officers themselves and their families have major difficulties, they can be reported to the Chairman by General Chen Pei for resolution. After this news was announced, the 8,000 surplus officers who participated in the meeting to welcome the Head of State today did not feel tired at all, even though they walked for five hours to and fro and stood for two hours. Among them, some had served as commanders and deputy commanders, and some had served as military division commanders, but now they eat, live, dress, and walk like a soldier. It is not a step backward but a step forward for senior officers to be able to relive the life of a soldier and even enjoy it. The officers who are incorporated into the Sixth Officer Corps and continue to receive academic and professional training, in terms of retraining, in September, the number of people is as follows: infantry 9,428, cavalry 48, artillery 148, engineers 244, transportation 36, communications 214, civil engineering 14, military police 124, political work 298, quartermaster 349, accounting 53, technology 11, military dependents 151, military doctors 243, for a total of 11,456 people. Among them, the retraining aspirations of the surplus officers are as follows: 206 in transportation, 1,904 in industry, railways, post offices, aviation, electricity, and police administration, 1,334 new army cadres, 16 conscription classes, 485 administrative officials, 449 in agriculture, forestry, and reclamation, 420 for further studies, 345 in labor service, 215 in popular compulsory education, 1,536 in mining plant management, 305 in finance, 5 to study in the United States, 204 in local health, 80 in the Army University, and 54 officials, for a total of 9,330 people. The rank of the surplus personnel in the corps is as follows: lieutenant general 11, major general 73, colonel 509, major 876, captain 2,400, lieutenant 2,162, second lieutenant 2,295, warrant officer 1,189. It was also found that the total number of officers in the Sixth Officer Corps undergoing retraining in September was 9,700. As of today, the total number of people allocated is as follows: 9,700 total members in September, 447 who retired and left the team, 142 who volunteered to go to the Northeast, 1,929 retired, 9 discharged, and 2,100 transferred to the provincial training corps. (Independent retraining) 24 in agricultural reclamation, 74 in finance, and 22 in land surveying. (Transferred to Xuzhou) 41 designated, 330 not designated, 572 participating in aquaculture training, 241 new army cadres, 375 technical officers, 333 policemen, 856 officer districts, and 61 in news. From the above statistics, we can imagine the importance of the tasks of the other 25 corps in the country from the organization, number of people, and achievements of the Sixth Officer Corps. We hope that all officer corps will have good results and use the facts to slap the faces of those new warlords who hold soldiers to harm the people. We should cheer, based on the brilliant results of the current streamlining of the army, "150,000 men lay down their armor; soldiers are truly fine men."</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Situation in Northern Jiangsu Will Soon Be Clarified; The National Army Tightens the Encirclement; The Northern and Southern Lines Are Advancing in Coordination <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 23rd] After the National Army recovered Lianghuai, the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu has lost its main stronghold. The Battle of Huaiyin was a crucial turning point in the situation in Northern Jiangsu. In that battle, the Communist Army mobilized 24 regiments, personally commanded by Chen Yi, to resist stubbornly. The National Army recovered the city, causing the Communist Army more than 20,000 casualties and capturing 5,000 people. Most of the elite forces have been lost. Following the Battle of Huai'an, more than 5,000 Communist troops were annihilated. The remnants of the Communist Army are like fallen leaves in the autumn wind, having lost their combat effectiveness, and are fleeing to Lianshui. The National Army is currently pursuing them in the area east of Lianghuai. The National Army on the southern line of Northern Jiangsu, in coordination with the progress of the northern line, is tightening the encirclement of the Communist Army from the Yangtai fronts. The Communist forces in Dongtai, the airport, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Binying, and Lianshui are all shaken. This reporter visited a senior general of the National Army in Xuzhou today, who predicted that there would be no major battles in the future of Northern Jiangsu, and that the National Army would clarify the situation in Northern Jiangsu in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 23rd] In addition to continuing to mop up the suburbs of Huai'an, the main force of the National Army is currently advancing towards Cheqiao.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Related parties stated that the recovery of Lianghuai dealt a fatal blow to the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu. In the future, the National Army may divide its forces into two routes, one advancing to Lianshui to complete the northern encirclement, and the other advancing directly north to Gaobin, making contact with the National Army in Yangtai, and connecting the canal embankment. At this point, the Communist Army lurking in the lake and swamp area in central Northern Jiangsu will retreat without a fight.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] There is still no major progress in the battles on the eastern front. The troops heading north are still滞留near Bin'an. The bridges and communication facilities on the Haitai Highway have been severely damaged by the Communist Army and are difficult to repair for the time being. The Communist Army in Xiaoji, Fanchuan, and Xinghua has been continuously reinforcing Gaobin in recent days. Yangbin will defend the canal embankment to the death. It is expected that if the Communist Army suffers another惨败on the canal embankment, it may continue to守住 the Gouwen west of the Fan public堤壩, so that the Communist Army can have a retreat route.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 23rd] According to official sources, the Communist Army in the Lianshui, Shuyang, and Gouyun areas has recently completely captured young men and women and moved them to southern Shandong and Yanfu. The area with the most severe Communist captures is near Gaojiagou, at the junction of Lianshui and Shuyang. All young men and women have been taken away, with no one left behind. According to the current situation, the Communist Army is about to abandon Lianshui.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 23rd] Wang Bingnan, a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party, said today that the Communist Army will adopt large-scale guerrilla tactics throughout the country. Except for Harbin and Zhangjiakou, the Communist Army will abandon all strongholds. The loss of Huaiyin and Huai'an is only the beginning of the Northern Jiangsu campaign. In the future, the Communist Army may be forced to retreat from Binying and Gaoyou, which is not necessarily the case.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Flour for Northern Jiangsu Refugees Has Not Yet Arrived; The Chairman Has Ordered the Executive Yuan to Expedite the Matter <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Five thousand tons of flour for relieving Northern Jiangsu refugees were allocated by the Executive Yuan to the Su-Ning branch in early September, but have not yet been delivered, preventing the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association from providing practical benefits to the refugees. When the Chairman was in Gu嶺, he ordered Director Chiang to expedite the matter. Furthermore, the flour that the Executive Yuan should have allocated to Northern Jiangsu refugees for relief in May has also not been delivered.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Communist Army in Shandong Province Busy With Mobilization; Military Conference Held in Yucheng <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 23rd] The Communist Army's attempt to launch a war in Shandong has become increasingly apparent. The government has received reports that the headquarters of the Communist Army's Bohai Military Region has moved to Yucheng City in northern Shandong to conduct business. A military conference is currently being held to decide to start military activities, eliminate the National Army on the north bank of the Yellow River, and plot to destroy transportation and blow up the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The National Army has taken strict precautions. The Communist Army in southern Shandong is still busy with mobilization, with about 10,000 people near Yanzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 22nd] The National Army is now using the seven county towns of Caoxian, Heze, Chengwu, Dingtao, Jinxiang, Shanxian, and Jining as bases to continue to expand into the countryside and eliminate the remaining Communist troops. The situation in western Shandong has been largely stabilized. The refugees from these counties who had fled to other provinces have been returning to their hometowns in groups, supporting the old and carrying the young. The scenes of songs and vehicles filling the roads and the enthusiastic atmosphere are only seen after victory. The Communist Army near Yanzhou Qushi has launched attacks on the National Army again in recent days. Its 16th regiment of the police brigade, with more than 500 people, attacked the National Army's outposts at Jinkouba and the airport near Yanzhou from the east bank of the Si River at dawn on the 21st. After being met with a head-on attack by the National Army, a fierce battle ensued for about half an hour. More than 30 Communist troops were killed, and the rest retreated to the original location of Daliushu陵城. In addition, more than 300 Communist troops attacked the guard unit of the Datanchang east of Jining on the 20th, but were repelled by the National Army.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Minister of Communications Yu Reports at the Memorial Week; Postal and Telecommunications Rates Will Be Increased; Railway Construction and Restoration Will Be Carried Out in Separate Zones <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The central memorial week was held at 9:00 am on the 23rd. President Dai Chuanxian presided over the meeting, and Minister of Communications Yu Dawei reported on the recent situation of transportation, briefly analyzing the current situation of railways, highways, waterways, aviation, postal services, and telecommunications. Yu stated that the current focus of transportation is on the construction and restoration of railways, which is being carried out in the southwest, northwest, and Bohai Road as the boundary between South China and North China. However, there are many difficulties, such as the lack of road construction materials, low freight rates, and lack of training for railway employees, which have greatly affected the progress of the work. Therefore, it is urgent to plan to restore the highways built during the war in various places to supplement the railways' shortcomings. At the same time, local governments are encouraged to build roads, especially the southwest highway, which is extremely important, and efforts will be made to maintain it. Waterway transportation is also being improved and port affairs are being reorganized. As for aviation, the biggest difficulty at present is the lack of equipment and facilities, and the lack of aircraft is secondary. The current losses are unbearable and cannot be maintained without price increases. Therefore, it is planned to increase prices at an appropriate time, but not to increase them too much.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] This reporter visited Minister of Communications Yu Dawei in the evening to inquire about the postal and telecommunications price increase plan. Yu stated that the price increase is inevitable, but the time of implementation is still uncertain. When asked if it might be brought up at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 24th, Yu repeatedly said, "No."</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Four Foreign Ministers Gather in Paris <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference has been going on for a month, and no agreement has been reached. All parties are concerned and eager to see progress. The war has just ended, and the opinions of various countries on rebuilding the European peace order are not entirely the same, and they do not want to act rashly. This is the phenomenon that should exist in creating peace. Therefore, we should not be disappointed by the slow progress of the Paris Peace Conference. While the Paris Peace Conference was in progress, we saw the US Secretary of State, the Soviet Foreign Minister, and the British Foreign Minister leave Paris one after another to go to Moscow, inspect the occupied areas of Germany, or return to London. Later, we saw US Secretary of State Byrnes' speech in Germany and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech in the committee meeting, explaining the diplomatic policies of the United States and the Soviet Union. At this time, US Secretary of Commerce Wallace delivered a speech in the United States, advocating appeasement of the Soviet Union, which caused an uproar and widespread criticism. Wallace had to resign. Now that Wallace has resigned, the storm caused by Wallace's speech has gradually subsided, and the four foreign ministers have gathered in Paris again. The Paris Peace Conference, which had been stagnating, may become active again, and the long-delayed foreign ministers' meeting may also be reconvened. Thus, after a period of stagnation and turbulence, Paris will once again become the center of international diplomatic activity. Based on the developments of the past few weeks, we would like to make a prospect of international politics.</p>
<p>The world situation in the year since the armistice has clearly stopped the coordination that existed during the war due to the cessation of hostilities. Originally, the maintenance of this coordination lacked a solid practical foundation and was only a wartime compromise. In order to maintain this wartime compromise, Roosevelt, who advocated international justice, did not hesitate to abandon the principles he upheld and the position he occupied, and not only built a high iron curtain with the Soviet Union, but also spread the "new democracy" of its socialist country outside the iron curtain. The post-war world was clearly shrouded in this atmosphere. Under these circumstances, Wallace advocated returning to a new "glorious isolation," regarding China as a "uncivilized place," and watching the sparks of Europe and the Far East across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Although this Wallace doctrine appears to be a "new isolationism," it actually inherits some of the mantle of the Anglo-American appeasement policy before the Second World War. Therefore, we cannot but seek the foreign policies of Britain and the United States from other aspects.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Byrnes' speech in Stuttgart clarified the US government's enlightened policy towards post-war Europe. Later, British wartime Prime Minister Churchill also delivered a speech in Switzerland, advocating the establishment of a European Federation, so that Europe could almost recover its prosperity. Churchill, as a person out of office, cannot represent the intentions of the British government. However, the Labor Party, which is currently in power in Britain, although advocating the implementation of socialism, which is considered "unscientific" by Marxists and Leninists, cannot be compared with the Soviet Union's "new democracy." Therefore, Churchill's speech may also represent the opinions of some British people. The ideal of a European Federation is not new to Europeans. After the First World War, French politicians advocated the establishment of a European Federation. However, at that time, the situation made the ideal a mere dream. Now that Europe is feeling threatened again, it may be that the people of Europe will feel the need for such an organization. However, whether it can be formed is still vague.</p>
<p>Will such an evolution make the world one world, or will it become two? In reality, one world is only a lofty ideal, and the real divide has long existed! The world is in troubled times. Of course, we do not want to see the distance of the divide widening, and we would rather pray that everyone should fill this divide at this time. However, in the effort to fill this divide, we have the right to demand that all major countries make concessions for the overall safety of mankind, and we cannot rely on us alone, even at the expense of sacrificing the principles we uphold, like President Roosevelt, to accommodate reality. How to strive to fill this divide depends on the achievements of the foreign ministers in Paris.</p>
<h3 id="e16">The Door to US-Soviet Cooperation <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>We have already discussed Wallace's resignation in our newspaper yesterday. For the sake of the global situation, we naturally feel that since Wallace's speech cannot represent the US government's foreign policy, the US government has the need to ask him to step down in order to seek consistency with the outside world. However, we still very much regret the occurrence of this unfortunate fact. Because, the door to US-Soviet cooperation seems to be separated by a layer of curtains again.</p>
<p>Here, we would like to state another view: Wallace's foreign policy is to make concessions to the Soviet Union, while Byrnes' foreign policy is to be tough on the Soviet Union. This difference is very clear. Can concessions gain the cooperation of the Soviet Union? Can toughness gain the submission of the Soviet Union? No one can predict these two points. However, Byrnes' tough policy, to date, seems not only to have failed to make the Soviet Union dare to do things, but has instead made the barriers between the US and the Soviet Union increasingly sharp. Wallace's foreign policy, standing in the position of the Americans, seems to have a need for experimentation.</p>
<p>The two biggest points in Wallace's speech and letter to Truman are that, in addition to his own "deep belief" that the serious problem of mutual distrust between the US and the Soviet Union due to different political and economic systems can be solved, he does not have a definite grasp. The opposition between the US and the Soviet Union, as pointed out in our editorial on the 19th, is a conflict of two kinds of democracy, in other words, the conflict between American democracy and Soviet communism. Wallace's plan for US-Soviet reconciliation focuses purely on military and economic aspects, and ignores the lofty ideals of these two human politics. Wallace was originally an agricultural expert and also served as Secretary of Commerce, specializing in agriculture and commerce, which makes him easily tend to overemphasize the superficial phenomena of human life and easily ignore the ideological activities of human beings to promote the realization of superficial phenomena.</p>
<p>Thought is the source of phenomena. According to Hegel, the human spirit, with the evolution of history, demands its own realization everywhere and at all times. Now the struggle between the US and the Soviet Union, the struggle between the two major blocs in the world, is not a struggle for atomic bombs and naval bases and ports, but a struggle for two great ideologies to demand their own realization. The fourteen communist leaders in the Kremlin, in order to realize the ideas they inherited from Marx, are willing to pay any price, take any means, and no international treaty can bind them. Under these circumstances, unless American society undergoes a fundamental revolution and becomes a Soviet-style "new democracy," US-Soviet cooperation is still not guaranteed. Even Wallace himself has not told Americans how much certainty there is.</p>
<p>However, Soviet-style "new democracy" is not welcomed by Americans except for a very small number of communists. Not only capitalists do not welcome it, but even workers do not necessarily welcome it. The United States today is the most prosperous country, and the living standards of its people are higher than anywhere else in the world. Since life is comfortable and they enjoy a high degree of democratic freedom, American workers have the least awareness of communist revolution among all the workers in the world. And the United States has no hope at all; even in other democratic countries, unless it is within its own military scope, there is no hope. The Greek referendum is a clear example. Human beings want to live, but they also want freedom. The biggest shortcoming of Soviet-style "new democracy" is that the people have no freedom!</p>
<p>Some people believe that Wallace's speech was a kind of probe by the White House in the United States. The US government is unwilling to go to war and is willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union, but any cooperation is not a one-sided matter. Since the US President allowed Wallace to deliver a speech, if the Soviet Union has a sincere response to cooperation, the US's tough foreign policy towards the Soviet Union may not be gradually changed. If this observation is correct, then President Truman's request for Wallace to resign is a manifestation of his continued disappointment after hope! Because since Wallace's speech was published, in addition to praising Wallace and scolding Byrnes, the Soviet government has not made any specific representations. Under such an attitude from the Soviet Union, President Truman had no reason to adopt Wallace's proposal and offer the secrets of the atomic bomb to Marshal Stalin with both hands.</p>
<p>We very much regret Wallace's resignation, because his speech did open the door to US-Soviet cooperation, but now that the guests are not coming, Wallace has resigned, and this door seems to have closed again. But we still hope that this door can be opened again at any time, and we believe that it will be opened again one day. In China, we pray that the door to US-Soviet cooperation will be opened sooner. Those in power in the United States may wish to learn more about the Soviet Union and study the background of communist thought; Soviet leaders may also wish to step out of the Kremlin and take a look at the true face of the world. When they understand each other, it will be when world peace truly sprouts.</p>
<h3 id="e17">The Necessity of Suppressing High-Interest Loans <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>High-interest loans are one of the most troublesome problems currently faced by the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>On one hand, there is rampant inflation, and on the other hand, there is a feeling of surplus capital with no outlet. According to normal theory, interest rates should be low at this time, and high-interest loans should not occur. However, theory is theory, and reality is reality. Such contradictory phenomena are not limited to this one issue in the current economic sphere.</p>
<p>Thus, the Four Banks' tight monetary policy has drawn special attention from the general public. All kinds of loans are being applied for continuously by various regions and industries; the withdrawal amounts from commercial banks are also being heavily discussed; whether loans exceeding 50 million must be approved by the Four Banks is also being widely criticized; some people have even raised the fundamental question of whether the Four Banks should continue to exist.</p>
<p>The Four Banks tighten monetary supply and refuse to extend loans, of course, have their legitimate reasons. From their perspective, stabilizing prices and avoiding further stimulation should be the main reasons. Recalling the beginning of the establishment of the grain loan, within two or three days, rice prices in various places experienced a huge surge. Therefore, their cautious attitude can be said to be well-founded.</p>
<p>However, the existence of high-interest loans now is a fact, the difficulty in turnover felt by general industrial and commercial businesses is also a fact, and the bankruptcy of many factories and shops is even more of a fact. It is said that the current interest rate in Japan is only about two percent, and in Taiwan, it is only about six percent. Then, whether the current daily interest rate of one and a half or even two percent in this port is too high for the industrial and commercial sectors that have to compete with others, and whether it should be improved, really does not need to be discussed further. Have those adults and gentlemen who preside over the Four Banks, and the financial giants, not thought about this?</p>
<p>There are two main reasons for high prices: one is inflation, and the other is insufficient supply. These are the most obvious facts. As a result of tightening the money supply, many production enterprises have already been unable to sustain themselves; the supply of materials will inevitably gradually decrease in the future. Is this situation indirectly raising prices? This question should not be ignored!</p>
<p>Moreover, the rising trend of prices does not seem to be stopped or reversed by the tightening of the money supply. In the past few days, major commodities such as gold, US dollars, yarn, cloth, rice, wheat, flour, cooking oil, wool fabrics, and rayon have not been soaring again? On the one hand, the rising trend remains the same, and tightening the money supply does not have the slightest effect of curbing it. On the other hand, it forces industrial and commercial businesses to go bankrupt, indirectly promoting the rising trend. We believe that this approach has indeed reached the stage where it should "correct mistakes when known," and we must be careful not to stubbornly continue down the wrong path to the end, causing China's industrial and commercial businesses to be destroyed.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Recently, merchants and residents in this city have often mentioned that the Central Bank's 1,000-yuan and 500-yuan banknotes printed by the Southeast Provinces, Fujian Baida Printing Bureau, in the 34th year of the Republic of China, are not woodblock printed. However, due to wartime printing and limited materials, it is inevitable that they become blurred after prolonged use. The bank has always accepted and used these banknotes as usual. If certificate holders have old banknotes, they can send them to the bank for exchange at any time.</p>

<p>Will Use Helicopters in the Area</p>
<p>[United Press, This Port] Several members of an American B-29 flight were forced to land near the Burmese border two years ago and were captured by the Gulu tribe and used as slaves. They were recently discovered by church members in the area, who notified the US military in Chengdu, who in turn informed the US military in Shanghai. The US military authorities in Shanghai dispatched three representatives to Chengdu yesterday to contact the notifying church members. The representatives are expected to return to Shanghai tomorrow to report. According to those familiar with the customs of the Gulu tribe, the Gulu tribe will not release prisoners unless a ransom is paid. They will generally request food and salt in exchange. The US military authorities are willing to accept reasonable requests.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] Colonel McConnell of the US Air Force Advisory Group in China stated today that the US Air Force in China has been ordered to do its best to rescue the American pilots who went missing in the Gulu area of western Sichuan. Any rescue organization wishing to set out to inquire about the whereabouts of the missing American pilots will be assisted by the Air Force Department under the group. According to McConnell, the mountain roads in the Gulu area are rugged and uneven, and the Gulu tribes are naturally wild. Rescue personnel have to use helicopters to facilitate search work.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The "escorting" procedures for the five major traitors, including Zhou Fo-Hai, were completed on the 23rd. At 12:30 noon, Prosecutor Chen Shengzu of the Capital High Court, accompanied by eight bailiffs, arrived at the detention center at 19 Ninghai Road in a large open car to handle the transfer procedures. First, Chen and Warden Zhang discussed everything in detail. At 2:30 PM, the bailiffs were ordered to set up posts at the entrance and on the roadside. Then, the luggage was moved onto the car. At 3:00 PM, the traitors filed out of the door one after another. Traitor Zhou led the way holding a cattail-leaf fan, followed by Traitor Luo and others. Each person was monitored by a bailiff. Then, because the car was slightly damaged, Traitor Zhou and others returned inside. After about ten minutes, Traitor Zhou boarded the car again. Traitors Zhou and Ding sat in the driver's seat, and the rest sat in the car compartment. When the five traitors left the door, they all lowered their hats to their shoulders to avoid being photographed. The clothing and attitudes of the traitors were as follows: Traitor Zhou wore a Prince coat, with black gauze wrapped around his left arm, seemingly mourning for Wang Jing-Wei, black leather-soled shoes, and a felt hat. Traitor Luo wore a gray striped short suit, yellow elastic-sided leather shoes, and a gray felt hat, with a cunning smile on his face. Traitor Ding wore a black felt hat, a blue cloth gown, black cloth-soled shoes, and held a small white package in his hand, his face pale, his expression dejected, and his eyes dull. Traitor Ma wore a dark blue striped fine wool gown, his attitude was stiff. The traitors carried a total of nine large packages, three leather suitcases, a large tin of biscuits, and two thermos bottles, totaling thirteen items. Yesterday, Traitor Ma's wife brought ten packages, and it was heard that there were also three leather suitcases and many other odd items. The prison authorities were afraid of criticism from others, so they temporarily left them behind. A quarter of an hour after Traitor Zhou left, Ma's wife, female caregiver, and maid came to visit and were very upset to hear that he had been escorted away. They immediately wanted to take the luggage away. The prison authorities agreed that they could pick it up tomorrow morning. After they left Ninghai Road, they went straight to the Capital District Court Detention Center at Laohuqiao. However, because the detention center was also overcrowded, they began interrogation and inspected the luggage at the same time, finishing only at night. It is reported that the five traitors were separately detained in cell numbers 4 and 6 of the Loyalty Ward. Warden Wan told reporters that they would enjoy the same treatment as ordinary prisoners and would not be allowed any special actions.</p>

<p>Tian Chongguang Executed by Firing Squad in Hankou</p>
<p>[Li Bao, Hankou, 23rd] The notorious special agent traitor Tian Chongguang was recently executed by firing squad in Hankou. It is reported that this traitor had served in various puppet positions under Ye Daopeng. Then, he suddenly changed his identity and was appointed as the direct group leader of the Military Statistics Bureau's Hankou branch. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the traitor was detained by the enemy in Nanjing. The enemy, seeing his potential for exploitation, sent him to Tokyo, induced him to reveal work secrets, and used the Tokyo radio station to communicate with Chongqing, providing the enemy with great convenience in intelligence. After the victory, Tian Chongguang went to Chongqing and was detained by the Military Statistics Bureau and transferred to the Wuhan Military Headquarters Military Law Office for interrogation. Tian Chongguang was executed by firing squad in Hankou.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Philippine President Roxas has sent a letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-Shek to plead for Major Shimpo, a Japanese war criminal currently detained in Jinan. When Roxas was under Japanese occupation in the Philippines, he was arrested by the Japanese side but was saved by Major Shimpo. The Philippine President sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-Shek to request leniency for Shimpo purely because some Japanese people who wanted to detain Shimpo had exerted their efforts. After a complicated process, they made Roxas aware of Shimpo's current situation. Roxas, in his condolence letter to Shimpo's wife, authorized his secretary to say: The President believes that Shimpo "risked his life to violate the order from his superiors to execute Roxas, and later continued to request a stay of execution."</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The foreign affairs authorities are very concerned about the 20,000 overseas Chinese trapped in Medan and Bagan.

On the other hand, they will investigate the damage suffered by overseas Chinese in the military conflicts in various parts of the Dutch East Indies. It is heard that Li Dijun has been designated as the head of the comfort group, and the complete list of members will be determined soon.</p>

<p>The Dutch Break Their Promise and Hastily Send Them Back</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 23rd] Before the war, from 1935 to 1941, there were more than 4,000 so-called "coolie" Chinese laborers on Bangka Island near Sumatra, who had accepted contracts from the Dutch government to work in the tin mines on Bangka Island. During the Japanese occupation, they suffered severe abuse, resulting in the death of more than half of them. Currently, because the contracts have expired, their situation is very dire and pitiful. They all wish to return to their home country. The Dutch have decided to send them back in batches. The first batch of 1,300 people left Bangka on the 21st of this month. One worker told reporters: According to the contract, the Dutch should provide all travel expenses for those who served for two years, as well as provide subsidies, a pair of shoes, and a hat. However, the Dutch broke their promise and only agreed to issue ten guilders per person when they arrive in Hong Kong. Whether the Dutch will keep their promise is doubtful. Overseas Chinese in the banking sector raised donations and distributed three and a half guilders to each person.</p>

Since the arrival of our Ambassador Li Tiezheng in Bangkok, Siamese newspapers have published reports on the issue of overseas Chinese entry regulations. Overseas Chinese believe that this is a test to gauge Ambassador Li's attitude towards this issue. According to Ambassador Li, a few days ago, he told a Central News Agency reporter that he does not believe that the Siamese government will adopt regulations on the entry of overseas Chinese, because other countries have lifted or abolished entry restrictions as a gesture of friendship to China.</p>

<h3 id="e27">New York Herald Tribune Editorial Refutes Zhou Enlai's Statement, Says Its Purpose is Purely for Propaganda <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] The New York Herald Tribune yesterday refuted Zhou Enlai's statement that US policy is undermining China's economy, saying that Zhou's remarks were purely for propaganda purposes and an attempt to damage the reputation of the United States. The newspaper's editorial, entitled "Mr. Zhou's Propaganda," reads as follows: The most absurd statement recently made in China is the statement by Zhou Enlai, who claimed that the policy of the United States is undermining the economy of China. The remarks made by Zhou, who is a Communist official, are obviously purely for propaganda purposes, and their purpose is obviously to undermine the reputation of the United States as much as possible. If Zhou could be concerned about the erroneous impression of China's economic situation, he could easily list its true causes. Just as everyone else has clearly observed, the reason is not mysterious at all. The first reason, and also the most important reason, is that the Chinese government has lost all its best sources of revenue while in office, so it has to rely on issuing banknotes to survive. This has caused terrible inflation. The second reason is that the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has delayed economic recovery, part of which is due to the effective cutting of transportation lines by the Communist army. The third reason is that there are many inefficient or corrupt (or both) officials in the government. The fourth is that the Soviet Union destroyed or removed local industrial equipment in the Northeast. Zhou has blamed the United States for this, and his reason is that some American surplus materials flowed into the black market after being handed over to the Chinese government. If this is true, then this matter is not important except in Shanghai and most other cities. To say that China's suffering is due to the United States selling China the materials that its army and navy no longer use is a full display of its unreasonableness and senselessness.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Report] London, 23rd, Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov this afternoon, and then met with Bidault to discuss the convening of a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference will be convened within 24 hours.</p>
<p>In addition, the Four-Power Foreign Ministers issued a declaration today, agreeing to hand over the issue of Italy's African colonies to the United Nations General Assembly for a decision.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 23rd, Broadcast: The main part of the Italian peace treaty began to be discussed in the meeting this morning, which is Article 17 of the treaty, the issue of Italy's former colonies. The original draft of the four powers contained three points: (1) Italy should renounce its rights to its former colonies; (2) the existing government authorities, namely the "British and French military government," should continue until the fate of these colonies is truly resolved; (3) the four powers are scheduled to decide on the fate of Italy's former colonies within a year after the signing of the Italian peace treaty. Representatives of various countries then successively expressed their opinions. Italian representative Bonomi said that Italians have historical actions in Africa, and there are now more than 100,000 Italians living in various territories, forming the basis of the economic foundation of these territories. Italians cannot renounce these colonies without any legal guarantee. Bonomi then expressed his gratitude to the Soviet and French ministers for their previous suggestions to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to change the political system of Italy's former colonies into a trusteeship system! He also requested that Italian groups still be allowed to continue to participate in the work of their African colonial governments. Representatives from Egypt and Abyssinia requested the return of Istria, and Egypt also requested the Garbousa source of Libya and the Solon Plateau of Libya. The Egyptian representative also proposed that Libya be governed jointly with the member states of the Arab League. Abyssinia stated that it was willing to temporarily give up Somalia, a former Italian colony, but reserved the right to express its position on this issue in the future. The Brazilian representative supported the suggestion of entrusting the former Italian colonies to trusteeship, but this will become an amendment to Article 17 of the peace treaty. New Zealand requested that the fate of the Italian territories not be determined only by the four powers, but should be decided by the United Nations.</p>

<p>[United Press, United States, Mia, 22nd] Railroad Employees Friendship Association Chairman Weidnan told reporters today that the political ideology led by Senator Pepper and former Secretary of Commerce Wallace can get great assistance from labor. Calling it Pepper-Wallaceism or Wallace-Pepperism is really irrelevant. Ninety-nine percent of railroad employees and the majority of all workers support this ideology, and Miners Union Chairman Lewis will also assist. Wade is not interested in organizing a third party because it has no hope of winning. What is needed now is to restore President Roosevelt's basic principles of freedom and progress.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Zurich, 22nd] Swiss Foreign Minister Petitpierre recently delivered a speech at the third meeting of the Women's Congress, in which he discussed the arrival of Soviet diplomatic envoys in Switzerland. He said that the restoration of diplomatic relations between Switzerland and the Soviet Union is not the highest point, but the beginning of permanent friendship between the two countries. Our ideas about democracy and the relationship between individuals and the country are different, but we all want to know the way of life of the Soviet people. Regarding the agreement between Switzerland and the United States on German property, the turbulent and uncertain future of Germany is almost one of the anxious factors in the general political situation. The current international situation is quite serious, and large and small countries are attacking each other, using terms that have never been used in diplomacy before, but I believe that the controversy will eventually be overcome, there is no doubt. The world has high hopes for the United Nations Charter, but unfortunately it has failed to live up to the world's expectations. Even if the war industries of ten countries continue to produce as usual, it will create very dangerous rumors that the so-called Third World War is inevitable. Fortunately, we still maintain an optimistic attitude and are not attacked by the deterioration of fear. In terms of Switzerland's neutral status, the United Nations Charter must impose the obligations assumed by the United Nations member states on our country, but our country is in a neutral position and it is difficult to fulfill it. Therefore, no one knows when Switzerland will be able to join the United Nations organization, but there is also a possibility that it can be realized in the shortest possible time. The meeting site of the United Nations Women's Organization may use the former League of Nations headquarters in Geneva.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Bose is Not Dead! <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 23rd] According to reports received here, astonishing news may be announced within a few weeks: Chiang-te-la Bose, the founder of the "Indian National Army," has safely returned to somewhere in India. Bose's All-India Forward Bloc party is said to be prepared to announce that Bose will appear before October. Bose is still admired by countless Indians. Now, the interim government of India has announced the cancellation of the warrant for Bose's arrest. Therefore, if Bose is still alive and reappears, it would be harmless. According to the news of Bose's death in a plane crash, it was originally issued by a Japanese news agency last year. At that time, although the news agency published photos of the wreckage of the plane and the funeral situation, and the passengers on the same plane described Bose's death, many people still believed that Bose did not die, but hid again as before, waiting for an opportunity to move again. This leader, who once had disputes with the highest authorities of the Congress Party, gained the worship of the Indian people during the war. It is expected that if he reappears, his reputation and status will be second only to Gandhi.</p>

<h3 id="e42">The United States Helps Japan Restore Its Industrial Economy; Japan's Cocoon Transport to China is Rejected; MacArthur's Textile Advisor Issues Statement <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] MacArthur's headquarters textile advisor, Magner, today accused Song Ziwen, President of the Executive Yuan of China, and stated that he opposed any silkworm cocoons being transported to China. The Chinese delegation to Japan had requested that 1.5 million pounds of Japanese silkworm cocoons be transported to China, but was rejected by MacArthur's headquarters. Recently, it has expressed dissatisfaction and indirectly accused American capitalists of attempting to monopolize Japan's silk industry, thus arousing Magner's backlash. According to Magner, the main source of Japan's occupation costs paid to the Allied forces comes from Japan's silk weaving industry, so the plan was not fulfilled as desired. Chinese silk factories purchased a large batch of poor-quality silkworm cocoons in China at the beginning of this year, believing that the silk made from these cocoons could be sold at high prices in the United States or international markets. The Chinese side is attempting to obtain better Japanese silkworm cocoons at low prices in order to offset the money it spent on purchasing silkworm cocoons in its own country before. Japan is in need of all its silkworm cocoons to maintain silk exports. Some Japanese silk factories are currently being urged to switch to manufacturing cotton and rayon fabrics, which is also for this reason. It has now been ordered that the Japanese expand mulberry fields in order to increase the number of silkworm cocoons, so that annual silk exports can reach 30 million pounds. Before the war, Japan exported 95 million pounds of raw silk annually. China currently has silkworm cocoons that can produce 20,000 bales of raw silk annually, but China has not yet achieved this. The Chinese delegation's request to transport Japanese silkworm cocoons to China came from a direct request from a Chinese silk company to the delegation. American businessmen have never used the government to ask MacArthur's headquarters to obtain Japanese export commodities for them. Any silkworm cocoons transported to China will make the Japanese economy even more at a loss. Therefore, transporting Japanese silkworm cocoons to China would violate the Potsdam Declaration and would not be in line with the purpose of occupying Japan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The US government's assistance to Japan in restoring its industrial economy is steadily progressing. This matter is being carried out in cooperation with the State Department, the Department of the Army, and other government agencies, with the aim of restoring Japan's economic status as soon as possible, at least to the point of being self-sufficient, and with the help of experts, to pay for the occupation costs of the United Nations. Japan's textile industry, cotton yarn industry, and rayon industry have all received strong assistance. The US government purchases all the raw silk that Japan can produce, and will provide more assistance to its rayon industry to revive it. For several months, it has continuously imported raw cotton into Japan and provided funds to purchase foreign goods that Japan urgently needs. However, Japan's re-entry into the cotton fabric export market has not been unanimously approved by the United Nations. In the Far East, India needs cotton fabrics, and Japanese yarn factories are willing to supply them. However, China, Britain, and other producers all hope to restore their pre-war businesses. According to the views of the American authorities, although this matter is opposed by all parties, it will continue to provide large-scale assistance to the Japanese textile industry.</p>
<p>Japanese Cotton Cloth Production Capacity Estimated</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] A recent report from the US military government in the Japanese occupied zone announced that an agreement has been established between the Japanese textile industry, the Bank of Japan, and the Ministry of Finance to establish a banking group to fund the activities of the cotton weaving industry. Before the war, Japan sold more than 3 million yards of cotton cloth annually in the world market. It is expected that by the end of this year, Japan will resume exports, most of which will be cotton fabrics, raw silk, and cotton yarn spun from American cotton. The Commodity Credit Corporation, a US government agency, will supply Japan with 890,000 bales of cotton this year, of which 185,384 bales have already been shipped. All of this cotton will be woven into cotton fabrics for export. Eighty percent of Japanese spindles were destroyed due to the war, which greatly reduced cotton cloth production. However, it is expected that production capacity can be doubled by the end of 1947. The production of cotton yarn is limited due to the lack of coal and chemicals, but the production of yarn pulp has greatly increased. This year's raw silk production is approximately 150 million yards, but only 30 million yards are prepared for export. Japanese silk exporters expect that within five years, Japan's raw silk exports can regain its leading position in the world market. It is heard that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are all willing to encourage the revival of Japan's textile exports for different reasons. The United States hopes that Japan will use textile exports to pay for imported food and occupation costs. Britain needs Japan to supply cotton fabrics to its colonies. The Soviet Union hopes to obtain Japanese textiles under a barter system. Therefore, the Japanese textile industry has a thriving appearance.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] Peter Kroll, head of the Economic Science Group of the Foreign Trade Division of MacArthur's headquarters, said that the Japan Trade Promotion Association recently sent a letter to the Trade Bureau, advocating changing the procedures for Japan's import and export trade, and implementing barter trade between manufacturers and various countries in the Far East. It is feared that it will not be approved by MacArthur. The dispatch of a Japanese observation group to foreign countries to investigate the international market situation may not be allowed, and even the free exchange of information on international market trends may not be allowed. MacArthur's headquarters is currently using the Japan Trade Bureau to monitor Japan's export trade and intends to continue monitoring it in order to benefit the Japanese economy and at the same time supply various scarce items to other parts of the world. According to Kroll, Japanese businessmen often mention direct trade, but the time is not yet ripe for Japan to manage international trade on its own. The headquarters is currently conducting personnel research, and may eventually allow some commercial relations with various countries, but it is still a long way off. The headquarters is currently implementing barter trade with various countries.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 23rd broadcast: A surprising discovery was made in today's trial of Japanese war criminals. The American side presented Nazi secret documents proving that Oshima, the former Japanese ambassador to Germany, had carried out a conspiracy to assassinate Stalin, but was unsuccessful. It is said that Oshima had sent ten White Russian spies across the Caucasus border with bombs to kill Stalin, but it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 23rd] Prosecutors at the Far East International Military Tribunal today continued to present various documents to reveal the truth about Axis diplomacy. As a result of the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Japanese Ambassador to Italy Shiratori in 1939, Prime Minister Hiranuma approved the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, Foreign Minister Arita was lukewarm, and Shiratori was very supportive. As a result, there were many reservations, and the alliance was limited to an anti-Soviet alliance. Oshima and Shiratori refused to convey this Japanese instruction to Germany and Italy, and hoped that Japan would fully accept the alliance plan. The German Ambassador to Japan, Walter, reported to his government that the Japanese Minister of the Army and the Minister of Finance supported the Tripartite Pact, while the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of the Navy expressed opposition. The Army was trying to establish the alliance, and if it failed, it would withdraw from the cabinet, while the Navy, led by Navy Vice Minister Yamamoto, expressed opposition. After Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression treaty, negotiations on the Tripartite Pact should be stopped, and it was said that the non-aggression treaty violated the Anti-Comintern Pact, but Oshima did not consider the protest insignificant and submitted the protest to the German government. In 1940, German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer reported to his government that he had obtained the assistance of Oshima, Shiratori, Terauchi, and Ishii, and that the pro-German elements in the Army, who had temporarily retreated, were planning to regain their power. Later, he telegraphed that although the Yonai cabinet was pro-British and pro-American, it was opposed by the Army and the people, so its policies could not be implemented. He had met with Konoe, Mimura, and others to incite anti-American sentiment in Japan. He is currently working to reconcile Japan and the Soviet Union, hoping that Konoe will become prime minister.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Baghdad, 22nd] The antelope man recently discovered in the Outer Jordanian desert is now being carefully taken care of by Gilbert of the Iraqi Oil Company. According to Gilbert, when this strange man of fifteen was captured, he ran at a speed of 50 miles per hour, which is more than twice the world record for the 100-yard dash. This modern "Tarzan" was probably abandoned by his mother when he was young and adopted by a herd of antelope, gradually learning various characteristics of the antelope. I have studied him in detail and found that his actions, cries, and sounds are all like those of antelope. He only wants to eat grass and does not want to eat ordinary food. But I am sure that he is human, but he grew up in an antelope herd. When he was first discovered by a person hunting antelope, he almost lost his life. Fortunately, a person in the shadows saw a child in the herd of sheep and immediately told his companions not to shoot. He then drove a car to chase, and the child ran at a speed of 50 miles per hour. Finally, he collapsed to the ground due to exhaustion. According to the Ruwala tribal chief who first took care of the child, on the first day the child was in his home, he jumped onto the roof and then jumped from one roof to another. Later, he jumped into the street, and finally, he sent out horses and carriages to chase and capture him after more than two hours. When the child was first discovered, there were many rumors, saying that he was half-human and half-sheep. Now we know that the child is indeed human, only more robust than ordinary people. Of course, he cannot speak human language, he can only make antelope sounds. It is said that he has recently become accustomed to human life. It is said that mothers of nomadic peoples in the Near East often abandon their children in animal herds, but most of them are eaten by animals. As for those who are raised by animals, there are very few.</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Riddle of the Middle East (Part 1) <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>—Original by Braidy, translated by Wenhao Jie</p>
<p>On the international stage, the Middle East is about to show its skills again. Here, Britain and Russia are opposed to each other, the United States stands on the side of Britain, and other countries are also eager to step onto the stage. It has recently acted as a mediator several times. As for the people of the Middle East, not long ago, they were bought out and had no idea about the plot of the play. But now the situation is different. The representatives of the people, whether real or fake, often occupy a considerable position on this stage. The key to the Middle East is in the hands of Britain and Russia. Britain is deeply afraid that Russia's encouragement of leftists in the Near East countries will threaten the lifeline of the British Empire. Conversely, Russia is deeply worried that Britain will use reactionary forces to create governments and make things difficult for it.</p>
<p>Difficulties are brewing everywhere in the Middle East. The factors can be roughly divided into three categories: the conflict of interests between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union; in the past thirty years, a high degree of nationalism has deeply gripped Islam; due to frequent contact with the West during World War II, a kind of social awakening has been created, and this awakening has been accelerated by the socialism brought by Russia.</p>
<p>Since the birth of civilization, geography and history have bestowed the Middle East with supreme strategic importance, because it is a bridge and a transverse road between many continents. It is part of Asia and also the only way for Westerners to come to the East. It contains the world's richest oil fields and many other undeveloped resources. The three powers are very clear: any country that alone controls the Middle East will eventually be able to control Asia and its 1.2 billion people, which is almost half of the world's population.</p>
<p>Turkey and the Straits</p>
<p>The powers are deeply afraid that Russia's influence will enter the Mediterranean through the Dardanelles Strait and the Black Sea, and the Persian Gulf through Iran. Britain believes that this kind of invasion is very unfavorable. In order to resist this kind of invasion, Britain often asks Russia to respect the territorial and political integrity of Turkey and Iran in the same way. With the support of the United States, Britain has gained greater trust from the conservative Turkish and Iranian governments. Conversely, Russia is also propagating that Britain and the United States want to control the entire politics and economy of the Middle East. Russia believes that it is not only excluded from the Middle East oil fields, but also faces effective walls everywhere for the naval and air bases it needs to resist the British military encirclement formed there. In today's collapse of the French and Italian navies, the Mediterranean has become a British lake. The Soviet Union has been demanding its rights over the Dardanelles. If the Dardanelles fall into the hands of Russia, Britain will not be able to stop the pro-Russian party in Greece from seizing power. Therefore, Turkey and Greece, like Greece, form a key part of British foreign policy.</p>
<p>The Iranian Incident</p>
<p>Iran also lies on the lifeline of the British Empire. The coastline of Iran forms the entire eastern part of the Persian Gulf. Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia are located in its northern and western regions. As early as 1914, Kuwait became an independent principality under British protection. At the same time, the King of Saudi Arabia has maintained friendly relations with Britain since taking power. According to the exclusive agreement signed in March 1892, these principalities, their monarchs themselves, and their heirs shall not enter into agreements or dealings with countries other than Britain, nor shall they accept envoys from any country other than Britain, nor shall they cede or sell any land to countries other than Britain.</p>
<p>Therefore, by means of these treaties, Britain fully grasped strategic advantages in the Persian Gulf. Any power that occupies a place in southern Iran can interfere with Britain's transportation lines in the Arabian Sea. It can advance eastward and knock on the door of North India. The reason why the Russian army entered Iran after March 2 this year, and Britain roared in the United Nations Security Council, lies in this.</p>
<h3 id="e55">City Government Budget Deficit of 22.1 Billion Yuan Approved; Decision to Open New Revenue Sources to Compensate, Imposing a Municipal Construction Surtax; Assembly Postponed Again; Horse Racing Issue to be Discussed Today <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its 21st meeting yesterday morning. First, a commemoration week was held, with Speaker Pan Gongzhan delivering a speech: Although the city government budget began to be discussed last Saturday, and several resolutions have already been made, there is no overall decision on the entire budget. Therefore, the first item on today's agenda is to decide on the budget. At the same time, it is hoped that in the morning meeting, the cases related to the budget and the additional tax levies will be discussed and decided based on the review reports, so as to make up for the budget deficit. If we only pass the budget without deciding on the compensation method, then the passed budget will still be nominal. Secondly, only half of the review reports of the various committees of the council have been discussed. If they cannot be discussed and completed in today's (that is, yesterday's) extended agenda, the assembly may be postponed for one or two days. Finally, Pan hoped that all councilors can consistently adhere to the spirit of not being late and not asking for leave during this assembly, so as not to affect the meeting and to be responsible to the voters. According to Pan's report, the number of councilors attending the first few days of the assembly was more than 150, while later attendees were only about 110 to 120.</p>
<p>The assembly discussed the mayor's proposed tax levies in the morning. After discussion and resolution, the additional clothing fees for the security corps and epidemic prevention expenses attached to the house tax were cancelled, reducing the total deficit by 1.8 billion yuan. When merged into the budget revenue, the total revenue and expenditure deficit reached 22.1 billion yuan. As for the source of revenue, the entertainment tax was still raised to 50% collection, but the levy of a sanitation fee was rejected. At the same time, it was passed to levy a surcharge on public utilities (excluding water bills), which could bring in 4 billion yuan for half a year. The house tax is levied at 20% of the actual rent, borne by the landlord. In the afternoon, the issue of who should bear the municipal tax was discussed, and the situation was quite heated. It was resolved that the municipal tax should be borne by the residents according to the house tax collection method.</p>
<p>Finally, the assembly passed the organizational rules for various committees of the Municipal Council. Each committee shall have one chairman and two vice-chairmen, who shall be elected by the committee members. The chairman shall not concurrently serve as the head of a labor union. The term of office is three months, and a re-election shall be held after each assembly adjournment. Each councilor shall participate in at least one committee and at most two. Each committee shall meet once every two weeks, and special meetings may be convened by the chairman when necessary.</p>
<p>In addition, because the assembly had many proposals to discuss, it was decided to extend the session until today. Today's agenda will discuss social, educational, public works, legal, and "horse racing" issues, and will also pass the assembly declaration.</p>
<p>Revenue and Expenditure Deficit! How to Compensate?</p>
<p>Two Focuses of Discussion</p>
<p>In the morning session, the municipal budget for the second half of the year continued to be discussed, with the focus on: (1) How much should the revenue and expenditure deficit be determined to be? (2) What new tax rules should be adopted to compensate for this deficit?</p>
<p>Before determining the deficit figure, several questions were raised regarding certain existing tax systems and city government revenue items:</p>
<p>Travelers Should Fulfill Their Tax Obligations</p>
<p>Wu Zhengzhuan first raised whether the hotel tax of more than 200 million yuan listed in the budget was reasonable. Gu Chunfan, director of the Finance Bureau, immediately explained that travelers to Shanghai also enjoy Shanghai's municipal facilities, so they should naturally fulfill a portion of their tax obligations.</p>
<p>The speaker explained that the temporary council had already decided to levy the hotel tax, so there was no need to discuss it again. However, Jin Runxiang and others raised it again, and the speaker put it to a vote, which resulted in only a very small number of people supporting the cancellation.</p>
<p>Zhang Xuelian asked whether the city government's revenue from the sale of materials, 4 billion yuan, and the revenue from various public utilities were included in the budget. Sun Yunfeng asked whether the materials received by the municipal government's Materials Reception and Management Office were also included in the budget. Regarding these points, the mayor immediately stood up to reply that more than 90% of the 4 billion yuan from the sale of materials had been used in the first half of the year for the living subsidies of civil servants. Regarding public property, most of the property rights involved foreign affairs issues, which are still awaiting the designation of a management committee by the Executive Yuan to resolve. As for the received materials, they will be included in the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Office in the future, so they cannot be listed as budget items.</p>
<p>Cancelling the House Tax Surcharge Increases the Budget Deficit</p>
<p>Xu Yongzuo pointed out that the previous assembly had resolved to cancel the security corps clothing fees in the house tax, but the entertainment tax originally also included this clothing fee, with a monthly revenue of 400 million yuan. If the levy is stopped from September, the deficit will increase by 1.6 billion yuan. If the collected fees for July and August also need to be refunded, the increased deficit will be 2.4 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Director Gu explained again regarding this issue that the security corps clothing fees attached to the house tax were listed separately under the "temporary receipts" account, but the clothing fees attached to the entertainment tax have never been separated and are all collected and spent together. If it is cancelled, there will be difficulties. In fact, the dispute over the entertainment tax is not about whether there is a clothing fee attached to it, but about the percentage of the tax rate. Entertainment businesses have repeatedly requested a reduction in the tax rate in the past month. What the council needs to decide now is whether to maintain the current tax rate, which is 40% of the ticket price, or to reduce it back to the previous 30%. However, in any case, if the deficit increases due to a reduction in the tax rate, it will still need to be raised from the citizens. Therefore, he believes that it is better to collect more from those who have extra money to enjoy entertainment!</p>
<p>The speaker read out the central government's regulations on the entertainment tax on banquets and entertainment, which stipulates that the entertainment tax should not exceed 50% of the ticket price. Therefore, he said: "The current budget only lists 40% of the ticket price, which does not exceed the regulations. If it is reduced, the burden will be universally increased for all citizens, which is wrong! It should be borne by those who have the ability to enjoy entertainment!" Yan Kuasheng suggested that the fine item in the budget could be increased by 300 million yuan, but Feng Youzhen opposed it, believing that there must be violations before there can be fines. If the specified amount is too high, there may be cases of arbitrary fines in the future.</p>
<p>Deficit of 22.1 Billion Yuan Approved by 110 Votes</p>
<p>The discussion of the details had taken up a lot of time, and the speaker finally decided to put the fundamental principle, the determination of the revenue and expenditure deficit, to a vote. The original budget compiled by the city government had a deficit of 33.3 billion yuan. After the ninth group reviewed it, adding what should be added and subtracting what should be subtracted, the verified revenue was more than 55.1 billion yuan, and the expenditure was more than 75.4 billion yuan, resulting in a deficit of 20.3 billion yuan. However, because the previous assembly resolved to cancel the security corps clothing fees and epidemic prevention expenses attached to the house tax, totaling 1.8 billion yuan, the revenue was reduced, and the deficit increased to 22.1 billion yuan. If this number is approved, a method of opening up revenue sources must be planned to compensate for it. Do the councilors agree? As a result of the vote, 110 of the 119 people present raised their hands in favor, and the principle was approved.</p>
<p>Three Methods for Opening Up Revenue Sources: Changing the House Tax to be Borne by Landlords, Increasing the Entertainment Tax to 50%, and Levying an Additional Tax on Public Utilities</p>
<p>After the deficit of 22.1 billion yuan was determined by a vote, the assembly discussed how to open up revenue sources to compensate for it. Among the five methods submitted by the mayor, except for the horse racing tax, which will be discussed separately, the review groups believed that the municipal tax and the public utility surcharge should be adopted.</p>
<p>According to the report by Lu Shidao, convener of the third group, the review process was based on three principles: (1) Avoid making citizens feel that there are excessive and miscellaneous taxes, (2) The tax standard should be proportional to wealth, (3) Collection should be simple to prevent loopholes. After discussion, it was felt that raising the house tax, although easier for citizens to accept, was clearly in conflict with central government regulations and might affect rent increases. The sanitation fee felt too meticulous. The public utility surcharge was the most fair and reasonable, and the easiest to collect, but the amount was too small. Although the municipal tax collection procedure was troublesome, it was more in line with the principle of fairness. Therefore, it was initially decided to adopt the municipal tax method, but after it was passed, someone proposed a reconsideration at the group meeting. As a result of the reconsideration, although the original decision was maintained, the number of votes in favor and against differed by only one vote. Later, private parties suggested using the name "municipal construction surtax," which includes the 4 billion yuan public utility surcharge, with the remaining deficit of more than 18 billion yuan to be collected by the Finance Bureau at a tax rate at its discretion, based on the current house tax ratio.</p>
<p>After Lu's report, the councilors expressed their opinions one after another, and the discussion was very intense. The important points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the public utility surcharge, some people believed that the water bill should not be levied because water is necessary for any commoner. Some people believe that the levy of electricity bills should take into account the situation of the industrial sector, because factories use the most electricity, especially yarn factories, and the fees are higher. Therefore, if it is desired to cultivate industry, the levy of electricity bills should be considered.</p>
<p>The Name is Not Proper, the Words Are Not Correct</p>
<p>(2) The most important thing is the opposition to the name "municipal tax." Tong Xingbai believed that the municipal tax is actually a property tax, levied according to the value of real estate, which is in line with the Three People's Principles of controlling capital. However, the name "municipal tax" is too vague, and he advocated changing it to a property tax. He said: "I hope that future taxes will be concentrated on real estate and property, and that we don't need to scrape the common people piecemeal!" But the speaker pointed out that the municipal tax is levied on residents, not owners. Therefore, if you want to levy a property tax, that is another matter and cannot be combined with the municipal tax. Wang Jian'e pointed out that in the era of the former Public Works Bureau, the house tax was called the municipal tax. Now that there is a house tax, if you collect a municipal tax again, it will give citizens a bad impression. He advocated changing it to a municipal construction surtax. Many people who spoke afterwards mostly believed that the name "property tax" was not true to its name and might lead to an increase in rent. It is better to use "municipal construction surtax."</p>
<p>(3) Chen Gongda proposed another method of opening up revenue sources. He believed that since the law stipulates that the entertainment tax can be up to 50%, the current rate is only 40%, and it can be increased by another 10%. In this way, the tax revenue can be increased by 800 million to 1 billion yuan in the three months from October to the end of December.</p>
<p>(4) Xu Yongzuo proposed that since the security corps clothing fees and epidemic prevention expenses have been removed from the house tax and the levy reduced, the method of bearing the burden should be improved. According to the central government regulations, 30% should be levied on the actual rental amount, borne by the landlord.</p>
<p>Passing Three Important Resolutions</p>
<p>After several tens of minutes of discussion, various opinions were summarized and put to a vote. Finally, three important resolutions were passed: First, the entertainment tax rate was increased to 50%. Second, the house tax was changed to 20% of the actual rental amount, borne by the landlord. Third, an additional public utility surcharge was levied. For the number that is still insufficient, the municipal government will use the name "municipal construction surtax" to make up for it at its discretion.</p>
<p>Finally, the discussion turned to the collection method of the municipal construction surtax. Should it be borne by the landlord? Or should it be borne by the tenant? Or should it be borne jointly by the landlord and tenant?</p>
<p>Opinions were clearly divided into three factions: One faction believed that the landlord should bear more of the burden. Their argument was that since the landlord owns real estate, he is naturally a wealthy class, and the wealthy should pay more taxes! One faction believed that the municipal construction surtax, as the name implies, is for municipal construction. According to the principle of equal rights and obligations, it should be borne by those who enjoy the benefits. Now that it has been resolved that the house tax should be borne by the landlord, the municipal construction surtax should be borne by the tenant. The compromise faction in the middle of these two factions advocated setting a ratio for the landlord and tenant to bear it fairly.</p>
<p>The debate was fierce, and the meeting was extended to 12:45 PM without a result. Finally, Xi Yushu suggested that the discussion be left to the afternoon, when specific figures could be studied before making a decision.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Attendees at the Assembly Are Not Responsible for External Statements; Clarification on the Appropriation of Temples <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Council passed Review Report No. 3 on the People's Livelihood a few days ago, resolving to "appropriate or borrow temples or public buildings" for the use of district offices, the Council has received many petitions from various temples and Buddhist associations.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Speaker Pan solemnly stated two points at the assembly:</p>
<p>(1) According to Article 18 of the Council's Organizational Regulations, attendees and those present at the meeting are responsible to the Council for their statements, but are not responsible for external statements.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Council's Review Report No. 3 on the People's Livelihood, which resolved to appropriate or borrow temples or public buildings for the use of district offices, the so-called appropriation was carefully considered. Temples that belong to the local public or public managers, and those that are currently abandoned, can naturally be appropriated. As for general temples, their consent should be obtained first before borrowing them, in order to protect the property rights of the temples and to ensure that the district offices can solve everything. All appropriation or borrowing procedures should be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the law, without any doubt.</p>

Yesterday, Yao Shaoxiu also brought evidence of the recruitment of students by the Buddhist Tongming School run by the defendant (see picture) to the Council, requesting that justice be served and that a public decision be made. Councilor Gong received them and reported to the assembly, saying: Many citizens have listed three major crimes committed by the monks Dewu and Miqia of Jing'an Temple. The most obvious point is the establishment of the Tongming Japanese Language School for enslavement education. They have reported and sued them to the High Procuratorate. Although the court has held hearings, the wanted criminals are still at large. Therefore, in response to the Council's deadline for reporting traitors, they have come to make a statement. After a decision by the assembly, this case will be transferred to the court for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Discussing the Municipal Construction Surtax; Resolution that it Should be Borne by Residents <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Municipal Council continued to discuss the issue of who should bear the municipal construction surtax. The councilors engaged in an unprecedentedly heated debate on whether it should be borne by the tenants or jointly by the landlords and tenants, and many based their arguments on actual figures.</p>
<p>The final resolution passed was: "(1) The municipal construction surtax should be collected in accordance with the method of Proposal No. 2 on the Father's Day. Of the total amount, except for the house tax levied at 20% of the actual rent, which should be borne by the landlord, the remaining amount will be the surtax rate, which is divided into three classes based on the current value of the house. Class A: houses with a current value of 100 million yuan or more will be charged a monthly tax of 3/1000. Class B: houses with a current value of 50 million yuan or more but less than 100 million yuan will be charged a monthly tax of 2/1000. Class C: houses with a current value of less than 50 million yuan will be charged a monthly tax of 1/1000.</p>
<p>Xu Yongzuo Reports that Landlords Cannot Afford It</p>
<p>Based on the above tax rates, Xu Yongzuo gave a report with figures. He used the rent of the 26th year of the Republic as a standard and divided it into three classes, A, B, and C. He explained that if the municipal construction surtax were to be borne by the landlord, the landlord would be unable to afford it. Assuming that the monthly rent for a Class A house in the 26th year of the Republic was 500 yuan, calculated at the statutory 160 times, the current rent is 80,000 yuan. After deducting the 20% house tax of 16,000 yuan, the net income is 64,000 yuan. The value of this type of house in the 26th year of the Republic was 50,000 yuan, calculated at 5,000 times, the current value is 250 million yuan. The municipal construction surtax at 3/1000 is 750,000 yuan. In addition to the net income of 64,000 yuan in rent, the landlord would lose 686,000 yuan. Even if the landlord and tenant each bear half, the landlord would still lose 311,000 yuan. For a Class B house, assuming the pre-war rent was 100 yuan, the current rent is 16,000 yuan. After deducting the 3,200 yuan house tax, the net income is 12,800 yuan. The current value is 50 million yuan, and the municipal construction surtax needs to be paid at 2/1000, which is 100,000 yuan. The landlord would lose 87,200 yuan. If the landlord and tenant bear it equally, the landlord would also lose 27,200 yuan. For a Class C house, assuming the pre-war rent was 20 yuan, the current statutory rent is 3,200 yuan. After deducting the house tax of 640 yuan, the net income is 2,560 yuan. The current value is about 10 million yuan, and the municipal construction surtax of 10,000 yuan must be paid. The landlord would lose 7,440 yuan. If the landlord and tenant bear it equally, the landlord would also lose 2,440 yuan. Finally, Xu Yongzuo asked: "Is this method reasonable? Is it feasible? As a result, the landlord would have to abandon the house because not only would there be no money to be made from owning the house, but money would also have to be lost. Who would want a house? In this time of severe housing shortage, it is actually impossible. Moreover, if the municipal construction surtax is paid by the landlord, it becomes a property tax, which is unreasonable. As the name implies, it should be paid by those who enjoy municipal construction."</p>
<p>Speaker Pan on Collection Methods</p>
<p>Speaker Pan discovered a very strange thing. He said: "It is currently very difficult to estimate the value of houses, and the appraisers of the Finance Bureau can manipulate the values, which will inevitably lead to abuses. The municipal construction surtax is levied according to the current value of the house. Councilor Xu Yongzuo has already given a report with figures. I have also done a rough calculation, but the result I calculated is about higher than Councilor Xu's. A Class C house should pay a municipal construction surtax of 12,000 yuan, a Class B house should pay 120,000 yuan, and a Class A house should pay 800,000 yuan. But there is one very strange thing. If the house tax is paid according to the method in Document No. 2, the city government can collect 18 billion yuan in half a year, which is enough to make up for the budget deficit. But the burden on the tenant is reduced. I don't know how the Finance Bureau is appraising it, but this method is beneficial to the general public. We have decided to levy 20% of the actual rent as the house tax. Now we can adopt the method in Document No. 2, but not for the house tax, but for the municipal construction surtax. According to the method in Document No. 2, this autumn, the house tax for Class A houses will be three times higher than in summer, for Class B houses it will be two times higher than in summer, and for Class C houses it will be one time higher than in summer. The so-called summer house tax collection method is 14% of the 560 times the rent in the 26th year of the Republic. This means that for a Class C house with a rent of 20 yuan in the 26th year of the Republic, the summer house tax will be 1,512 yuan, the autumn tax will be 3,024 yuan, and the winter tax will be 6,048 yuan. The average of the autumn and winter seasons is only over 4,500 yuan, and the 20% of the actual rent paid by the landlord can also be deducted. But if 1/1000 is levied according to the current value of the house, even if the landlord bears half, the tenant will have to pay a municipal construction surtax of 5,000 yuan. So, according to this method, the tenant is cheaper. According to this method, for a Class B house with a pre-war rent of 100 yuan, the autumn tax will be 22,680 yuan and the winter tax will be 45,360 yuan. But according to the municipal construction surtax rate, if the tenant bears half, he will have to pay 50,000 yuan. For a Class A house with a pre-war rent of 500 yuan, the autumn tax will be 151,200 yuan and the winter tax will be 302,400 yuan. But according to the municipal construction surtax rate, if the tenant bears half, he will have to pay 375,000 yuan. Therefore, if we collect according to the method in Document No. 2 and deduct the house tax that the landlord should pay from the total amount, the tenant can save a lot of money. No matter which class of house it is, the money paid by the tenant is less than half of the municipal construction surtax levied according to the current value of the house. Therefore, I suggest adopting this method." The councilors applauded enthusiastically in agreement.</p>
<p>A Debate on the Burden Issue</p>
<p>Director Gu and Lu Shidao also provided explanations regarding the statistical reports. Director Gu explained that the burden on the landlord after 20% of the actual rent is levied as the house tax depends on the rent he collects. The higher the rent, the higher the house tax will naturally be. Lu Shidao explained that it is unreasonable for the municipal construction surtax to be borne by the landlord.</p>
<p>Traditional wisdom first looks at it from a theoretical perspective. He said: "I don't calculate numbers, but we must pursue the truth. To be honest, in terms of burden, neither the landlord nor the tenant can afford it. What is currently being levied is the municipal construction surtax. Whoever enjoys municipal construction must pay the tax. If the name is not proper, the words are not correct. We must understand this point. As for the landowner, he will have to pay the land price tax and the land appreciation tax in the future, and that amount will certainly be very large." Xi Yushu also spoke in pursuit of the truth, believing that the truth is that the municipal construction surtax should be borne by the tenant. Vice Speaker Xu said: "I am a worker but I am speaking for the capitalists. What rich people have in their hands now is definitely not real estate, but gold bars, US dollars, cotton yarn, and other goods. Taxes should be reasonable." The final conclusion was also that "the municipal construction surtax should be borne by those who enjoy municipal construction."</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihan stood up and shouted loudly, asking the councilors not to think too much about the landlords and forget about the residents. They must know that the residents cannot afford it either. Wang Jian'e also firmly maintained that the burden on the tenants should be taken into account.</p>
<p>Don't Forget the Second Landlords</p>
<p>Li Wenjie, Jin Runxiang, Tao Baichuan and others all expressed many opinions on the method of estimating the current value of houses. Feng Youzhen reminded everyone not to forget the third type of person besides the landlord and the tenant: the second landlord. Because he is a tenant to the first landlord, and he is a landlord to the second tenant, he always benefits and takes advantage of everything. Therefore, we must not relax our control over the second landlord.</p>
<p>The councilors engaged in heated debates. But in the end, Speaker Pan stood up and spoke, finally obtaining the approval of an absolute majority, and the bill was resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Night Soil Boats Scramble for Business, Yang Qishan Accused, District Court Opened for Trial Yesterday <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] During the enemy-puppet period, Wang Yongkang contracted the cleaning affairs of various night soil wharves in the city and organized the Da Kang Cleaning Company to handle the matter. Xu Yongquan was assigned to be in charge of the Guanqiao wharf to arrange the berthing order for night soil boats (meaning that night soil boats should be loaded according to their numbers and not scramble for priority). After the victory, Wang was arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of being a traitor. Yang Qishan, a gang leader from the Nanshi wharf, had many followers and was very influential. His disciples, Shen Baoyou, Gu Dabao, etc., used the excuse that Xu Yongquan's berthing arrangement was unfair and took the lead in making things difficult. Shen Baoyou had been reported to the Penglai Road Military Police Station by Xu Yongquan under the guise of being a guerrilla during the enemy-puppet period and was detained once. Therefore, after the victory, he came out to obstruct Xu Yongquan's berthing arrangement and caused conflict. He also accused Xu Yongquan of being a traitor to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. Under duress, Xu Yongquan compromised and became a disciple of Yang Qishan, and Shen wrote a settlement agreement. Yang Qishan then obtained the right to arrange berthing order and jointly discussed the handling terms, which were registered with the Social Affairs Bureau but not approved. There was still conflict and fighting between the Jiangbei gang and the Shanghai-Songjiang gangs at the Guanqiao wharf, and they attacked each other in the newspapers, causing constant disturbances. After being reported, the police arrested them and transferred them to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Yang Qishan was charged with disrupting the loading of night soil boats and directing his disciples Chen Zhixiang and Shen Baoyou to exercise berthing arrangement rights, forcing boat owners to comply, and obstructing the freedom of loading of various night soil boats. He was prosecuted for disrupting order and undermining social security. The trial opened at the District Court yesterday afternoon, and after investigation, the court ordered a new hearing at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Foreign Nationals Attempt to Restrict Freedom of Speech, Case Closely Watched by Chinese and Foreign Journalists, American Reporter Sued, Trial Concluded, Lawyers for Both Sides Gave Eloquent Arguments, Court Adjourns, Sentencing on the 27th <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The District Court continued the trial yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM of the case of defamation filed by Shen Ke, a German national suspected of being a Nazi, against Lundahl, the Shanghai Office Director of the American United Press. The gallery was packed, with Americans accounting for almost half of the audience. Shen Ke did not attend and was represented by his agent, lawyer Yao Zhaodi. Lundahl was represented by lawyer Chen Tingrui. The lawyers for both sides engaged in fierce debate. At 4:30 PM, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 27th. According to Chen Tingrui, although the court has scheduled a sentencing date, it does not necessarily indicate that the case will be accepted.</p>
<p>The trial began in an extremely tense atmosphere. When Lundahl stepped to the defendant's stand, he looked slightly uneasy. Yuan Lunren, a well-known reporter from United Press, stood beside him and translated everyone's speeches in a very low voice. Lawyer Yao first declared to the court that Shen Ke could not attend because he was detained in a US military court detention center. The court then approved Yao's representation.</p>
<p>According to International Law, Shen Ke Has No Right to Sue</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen Tingrui then stood up and defended Lundahl in a slow and forceful tone. He stated that according to the law, the court should not accept cases that are not filed as private prosecutions but are filed as such. Shen Ke's inability to file a private prosecution can be based on international law and the law of the Republic of China. According to international law, Shen Ke is a German national and a well-known Nazi member, listed on our country's list of those to be sent back to Germany, and is still detained in a US military court for war crime behavior. China and Germany have not yet made peace, and they are still in a state of war in the eyes of the law, so the plaintiff's identity is that of an enemy alien. There is no clear provision in our country regarding whether enemy aliens have the right to sue, but international law is a law jointly recognized internationally, so international law should be regarded as part of the laws of all countries. According to the provisions of international law after World War I, there is a relative right to recognition of enemy aliens' right to sue. The United Kingdom and the United States recognize the right of enemy aliens to sue, but there is a prerequisite that the enemy alien must continue to reside in the country and be a law-abiding citizen who is allowed to reside by the local government. Shen Ke has not been allowed by our government to continue residing in China, and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a letter certifying that "Shen Ke is one of the German expatriates on the list to be sent back to Germany and has been detained for war crime suspicions." Chen presented the letter as evidence and continued that this proves that Shen Ke is definitely not welcomed or allowed to stay in our country by the government. Moreover, Shen Ke is not only a Nazi Party member but also a Nazi spy! Therefore, according to international law, Shen Ke has no right to sue.</p>
<p>Based on the Provisional Constitution, Please Do Not Accept This Case</p>
<p>Next, regarding our country's Provisional Constitution, according to Article 15 of Chapter 2 of the Provisional Constitution, people have the freedom of speech and publication. Our government has also repeatedly declared freedom of speech as a political program. The defendant is the director of the United Press Office in China, and as a journalist, his freedom of speech should be strictly protected by law. Articles 19 and 7 of the Publication Law have relevant provisions. Journalists have always adhered to the principle of recording what they hear when reporting news, but now the plaintiff is trying to use the identity of a Nazi enemy alien to restrict the freedom of friendly nations and sue your court, which is insane! It must be known that Nazi law can prohibit the people's freedom of speech, but Nazi law can never be applied to democratic China! This case is not only related to journalists and publishers of friendly nations in China, but also has a very important relationship with journalists and publishers in our own country. Your court should not accept it.</p>
<p>Chen continued to cite the works of Oppenheim, an authority on international law, stating that enemy aliens cannot file lawsuits or have the right to defend themselves in court. He also cited Noyes, stating that the protection of foreign nationals should be limited to those who are law-abiding and continue to reside in the country. He also said that this case has attracted international attention. The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, an English newspaper in the city, published a cable from New York, stating that the outcome of this case will have a great impact on whether foreign journalists have freedom of speech in China. The Chinese government should not accept this case in order to maintain freedom of speech. He said that today, on behalf of the defendant, he asks the court to rule that the case not be accepted based on international law and the law of the land.</p>
<p>Plaintiff's Representative States That Private Rights Should Be Protected Regardless of Victory or Defeat</p>
<p>Lawyer Yao Zhaodi, the agent of Shen Ke, then stood up and replied that the defendant's lawyer's defense is based on international law and the law of the land. Now, he would like to reply to the legal aspect first. The law indeed stipulates freedom of speech, but this freedom should have appropriate restrictions, otherwise, the chapter on defamation in the criminal law could be abolished. Therefore, the so-called freedom should be freedom within the scope of the law. Whether the defendant has exceeded the freedom of speech stipulated by the law should still be investigated by the court before making a verdict of guilty or not guilty. As for international law, in feudal times, when wars occurred, the defeated had no other way but to become slaves. However, it should be known that this concept is a feudal concept. The various books presented by the defendant's lawyer have not been read by this seat, and it cannot be said whether they are excerpts taken out of context, but at most, they are just one person's opinion and are not sufficient as evidence. Regardless of victory or defeat, the private rights of the people should be protected. In 1907, various countries signed an international convention in The Hague, including China, the United States, and Germany. Article 23, Paragraph 8 of Chapter 4 of the convention expressly prohibits the abolition of the rights of the people of the defeated country to sue. People cannot live without their rights and cannot be without the protection of the law. To give an example, if the victim in a rape case that requires prosecution is a German expatriate, and they are not allowed to sue, then the case cannot be established!</p>
<p>The defendant's actions have indeed exceeded the scope that journalists should abide by. The source of his news is unknown, and the exaggerations are numerous. His actions have harmed our country's public order. After this case occurred, Lundahl actually appealed to the US State Department, intending to use the political power of his country to coerce our government! I urge the court to consider the facts of the case, be fair and calm, and discuss the case on its merits.</p>
<p>Shen Ke was sent back to his country in a "general" evacuation of expatriates. Those who are sent back are not necessarily bad people. Our government is only afraid that they will not be able to maintain their livelihood after staying in China, so they order them to return to their country. Therefore, the defendant's lawyer's statement that those who are sent back are bad elements is not worthy of consideration. Although Shen Ke has now been prosecuted, he has not yet been sentenced. The crimes prosecuted by the US military court are only espionage, and there is no factual basis. They actually want to fabricate the charges and deliberately create a major case!</p>
<p>At this time, Lawyer Chen angrily stood up and said that the prosecution of this case is illegal, and the defendant is unwilling to discuss the substance of this case through this illegal path.</p>
<p>There Are Three Pieces of Evidence</p>
<p>However, although Lawyer Yao was hit by this, he continued his statement, saying that the defendant cannot prove that the defamatory facts are true and reliable, and the plaintiff can prove that Lundahl's words are absolutely not true. There are three pieces of evidence: (1) Ambassador Chen Jie has a letter certifying that Shen Ke's actions have always been beneficial to China. (2) Shen Ke left Chongqing on July 11, 1941, via Hanoi to Shanghai, which can be proven by the visas on his passport. At the time he left Chongqing, China had not yet declared war on Germany. Now Lundahl claims that his departure from Chongqing was to sabotage our country's underground work, which is clearly a complete fabrication. (3) After Shen Ke returned to Shanghai, he often had contact with the important person in charge of our country's underground work. Wu Shaoshu has a letter certifying that he and Shen Ke often met due to the introduction of the person in charge of the organization department, and he called Shen Ke a loyal friend of China. In Chongqing, he often praised our country's war of resistance in his reports and exposed Germany's pro-Japanese tendencies. Wu's letter also stated, "We often meet, but there is no mutual use or exchange of information." He also said, "I have always trusted Shen Ke and have no doubts about him, so I often meet with him." He later declared, "My acquaintance with Shen Ke and the relationship that developed thereafter have been reported to the organization department for the record." It can be seen that what Lundahl wrote is purely fictitious.</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen then stood up again to reply, reiterating that Shen Ke's private prosecution is illegal and stating that Nazis have long disregarded international law and treaties. The self-sued agent dismissed Oppenheim's work as "one person's opinion", but no matter how brilliant the self-sued agent's study of international law is, it may not be as good as this authority. The binding degree of the Hague Convention varies according to different theories, and whether it applies should be determined by each country's government itself. Taking the United Kingdom and Germany as an example, they had already expressed that they did not recognize it. The binding of the treaty should take reciprocal treatment, and Germany itself has already suspended its application. Now, it wants to seek its protection?</p>
<p>Why Doesn't He Arrive, Why is He Detained</p>
<p>To say that the defendant attempts to use political power to coerce China is even more laughable! It concerns international issues between China, the United States, and Germany. It is not excessive for the defendant to seek the opinion of his own government, and there is no attempt to use political power at all! The plaintiff should know that he has a guilty conscience because he actually wants to use the power of the Chinese court's judgment to try to overturn the US military court's conclusive evidence.</p>
<p>The self-sued agent also said that the enemy expatriates who are sent back are not necessarily bad people, which also lacks common sense. The Chinese government sends back enemy expatriates without a fixed standard. The Nazi elements, spies, and hooligans who were sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were sent back. If the 2,000 German expatriates who remained in China sued here today, this lawyer would not object. Also, may I ask whether Chinese expatriates in Germany had the right to sue Germany when China and Germany were at war? Only if it can be proven that there is indeed the right to sue can one talk about reciprocity. Moreover, the publication of this news was not limited to the United Press. The Associated Press had it, and the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao also had it. The source of the news was actually a press conference held by the US military headquarters. Finally, there is one more point: according to our country's criminal procedure law, the self-sued agent should not be accepted if he fails to arrive after being summoned without a valid reason. The self-sued agent in this case has been summoned twice. Why doesn't he arrive? If it is said that it is because he is detained, then for what reason is he detained? Can it be considered a valid reason? I still ask the court to consider it.</p>
<p>Lundahl then began to speak after standing for an hour and a half, stating that he completely agreed with the arguments of his defense counsel and did not want to prove whether Shen Ke was a spy today. The source of his reports was the US military department, and the self-sued agent seems to want him to prove whether the words of the US military authorities are true.</p>
<p>At 4:30 PM, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 2:00 PM on the 27th.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Several months ago, a large number of smuggled goods from the United States arrived in Shanghai and were sold throughout the city. US Navy Lieutenant Warner was suspected of being heavily involved. The US Navy authorities sent personnel to monitor him and appointed Lieutenant Asah to be responsible for the search. Warner secretly sent a letter to a well-known American lawyer, Roger, entrusting him to handle unfinished business. Roger loaded more than a dozen letters related to smuggling and eleven packages containing a large number of nylon stockings, lipsticks, perfumes, and other luxury goods into a car the other day. When the car was passing the Bund, Li Tingzhu, a bailiff sent by the District Prosecutor's Office, showed a search warrant. At the same time, the police station, customs, and other agencies also sent personnel to the scene. The untaxed luxury goods were all seized and escorted back for investigation.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Winter is coming soon. In addition to actively preparing winter clothing, you must also be thinking about how to keep your bedroom and living room warm in the severe cold. Undoubtedly, installing a heater is the most ideal, both economical and convenient. However, this year is different from previous years. The city's electricity demand has already exceeded electricity production. Factories are even having rotating power outages, let alone the luxurious electric heating. In order to maintain normal power supply, Mayor Wu has decided to prohibit the use of electric heaters this year. The power company will dismantle the electric heating devices of users throughout the city. The direct supply of current to electric stoves will remain the same. If the Shanghai Electric Power Company removes the extra burden of electric heaters, then the electricity for lighting and electric stoves (limited to those officially installed with electric stove meters) can be supplied abundantly, and there is no need to worry about the power problem in winter.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the first anniversary of the opening of the Asia Money Exchange at No. 818 North Sichuan Road. The business was booming because of the recent surge in gold and US dollars. Unexpectedly, at 1:00 PM, a robber wearing a dark blue suit, carrying a briefcase, claimed to want to buy a large gold bar. A clerk led him to the inner room. While looking at the goods, the robber opened the briefcase, pulled out two automatic weapons, and forced all personnel not to make a sound. At that time, five other robbers, each holding firearms, followed in. One robber acted as a lookout, sitting on the counter outside the room, pretending to be a staff member. One robber guarded the back door, one robbed, and two guarded the clerks. While they were robbing, a Russian man came to sell US dollars. He was driven into the inner room by the lookout robber and ordered to "sit down" in English. The robbers stole more than one hundred taels of gold, eight million national currency, and two thousand five hundred US dollars, all of which were packed into a travel bag. At that time, the lookout robber shouted, "The wind is coming," and they all rushed out of the front door and fled north. When the robbery was taking place, a Zhou surnamed employee of the exchange took the opportunity to slip out of the back door and reported to the nearby police officer. Therefore, when the robbers carried the loot out of the store, the police officer fired at them. The robbers also returned fire and resisted arrest. Because the area was busy, the robbers were able to escape. After Commissioner Xuan heard the news, he ordered the Hongkou Police Sub-bureau to solve the case within a time limit because the robbers dared to rob in broad daylight.</p>
<h3 id="e73">A Smuggling Case via Air Transport Cracked with Twists and Turns; Large Scale; Offices Set Up in Major Cities Including Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Taiwan; Thirteen Men and Women to be Escorted to the District Procuratorate Today <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, the air transport drug trafficking case cracked in this city has led to the arrest of over twenty suspects. After days of investigation by the police bureau, except for some who were released on bail due to insufficient evidence, the remaining thirteen suspects (including one female) have all been interrogated. Today, they, along with confiscated morphine and gold bars worth approximately 100 million yuan, and specially made suitcases with hidden compartments used for transporting drugs, will be transferred to the district procuratorate. The process of cracking the case was quite tortuous. The Criminal Police Division of the police bureau mobilized officers from the Second Section, working day and night to pursue clues, even extending the police network to Beiping, Tianjin, Taiwan, and other places. As a result, all were eventually apprehended.</p>
<p>It began on the 10th of this month when Director Xuan received a confidential report stating that a major drug lord, Song Zhian, residing at No. 32, Hehe Lane, Lin Sen Middle Road, had recently entrusted a large sum of money to the Shanghai Xinhua Bank to be remitted to Tianjin. This money was intended for purchasing and transporting morphine. Director Xuan immediately instructed Director Zhang of the Criminal Division that evening to send officers to investigate. After Director Zhang and Section Chief of the Second Section discussed it, they immediately dispatched Section Member Feng Qishan and Clerk Li Xiqing to Hehe Lane to investigate. Unexpectedly, the place turned out to be an empty house, and the homeowner, Zhu Qishan, had also escaped when arrested by the district procuratorate in a drug trafficking case ten days ago. Feng and others, suspecting the circumstances, conducted a search and found a deed for a house Zhu Qishan had sublet at No. 10, Pan'neng Street. They tracked and investigated until the afternoon of the 11th, when they finally learned the address where Zhu Qishan was hiding. They then led police officers Zhang Yunming, Ding Zhaogan, Gao Fuhai, Ding Wenjiang, and others to Room 12, No. 4, Kunshan Garden, and arrested Zhu in the suite. On the spot, they confiscated two pounds of coffee essence and half a washbasin of black poisonous material. While they were searching, a Taiwanese man named Sun Zhicheng arrived with four gold bars, weighing a total of 39 taels, 5 mace, and 4 fen, intending to purchase morphine. He was immediately detained, and officers were dispatched to his residence at No. 9, Jishan Lane, Wuchang Road, where they confiscated three pounds and two taels of morphine raw material and one pistol. At that time, a well-dressed, burly Hebei man arrived with an officer. The officer was carrying a suitcase. Upon entering the room and discovering the unusual situation, they attempted to flee, but were stopped by the police officers. After interrogation, one was identified as Zhang Mingyuan, 32 years old, and the other claimed to be a colonel officer of the 94th Army named Yan Dongfu, 37 years old, stating that they had just arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight. When the police officers asked them to produce their identification, they evaded the request, confirming the suspicion of impersonation. The suitcase they were carrying was opened and inspected, and three pounds and five taels of morphine raw material were found in the hidden compartment of the suitcase. At this point, in addition to taking the above-mentioned suspects into custody, the police officers continued to guard the premises day and night. Meanwhile, the Hongkou Police Precinct also received confidential reports and apprehended five accomplices in the case at No. 54, Yifu Lane, Baoshan Road, Room 311 of the Royal Hotel, and other locations, including Taiwanese citizens Li Hongying, Zhang Gengtian, Zhang Yiren, Li Dingguo, and Zhang Li Bingkun (female). Details have been recorded in this newspaper. Later, during the investigation, the police bureau learned that the main offices of the case were located in Beiping, Tianjin, Taiwan, and other places, and that the key person in charge was Song Zhian. A telegram was sent to the Tianjin Police Bureau to assist in the apprehension, and he was apprehended on the 15th of this month. In Shanghai, four more suspects, Zhou Da, Ma Baiwu, Lü Xinquan, and Song Zixin, were successively apprehended, and three specially made suitcases with hidden compartments, thirty-five rubber sleeves for storing morphine, and a large amount of evidence such as drug trafficking profit distribution lists and copies of telegrams were confiscated. A Northeastern Advance Army identity card and a Northeastern Advance Army military certificate were also found at Zhou Da's residence, it was said.</p>

<p>[Our Report from Beiping, 23rd] As Fu Sinian is about to leave Beiping to return south after completing his mission as the "Forward Command Post of Peking University," two major events involving Fu Sinian have been published in the newspapers: (1) Fu Sinian strongly disagrees with the verdict of the Hebei Higher Court acquitting Bao Jianqing, the puppet Peking University president. He cited four reasons, including Bao's leadership of students on a study trip to Japan and the publication of an article titled "Ramblings on the Greater East Asia War and Our Determination," and requested a retrial. The prosecutor has already requested a retrial. (2) Su Ting, a member of the investigation team, accused Ta Kung Pao and Beiping Yishi Pao of not publishing news released by the team regarding the embezzlement of Japanese Kojima Ryosho's ancient books and paintings by Shen Jianshi, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Education. Fu Sinian specifically wrote to the investigation team, believing that Su Ting should not have made this accusation before confirming that Shen Jianshi was at fault.</p>

<p>City Councilors Shen Ding and Others Propose Abolishing Art Normal Schools, etc.</p>
<p>[Our Report] City Councilors Shen Ding, Jiang Huaishu, Lu Yinchu, He Yuanming, and others will propose a temporary motion on the last day of the extended City Council session today (the 24th), requesting the municipal government to order the Municipal Education Bureau to promptly adjust its affiliated institutions, conserve expenses, and popularize national education. The reasons are as follows: Upon reviewing the Municipal Education Bureau's policy report to the Provisional Council and the municipal government's proposed work plan for the 35th year (education section) submitted to this council, both include proposals to increase vocational schools, but in reality, there has been no active preparation. However, institutions not included in the plan, such as art normal schools, have suddenly opened, showing that the so-called plan of the Education Bureau is merely a document on paper. Therefore, previously established institutions, such as the Experimental Drama School and various central stations, may not necessarily have been considered for their value to the current stage of education in this city. The pressing need directly felt by all citizens is the lack of municipal primary and secondary schools, with children having no suitable places to study. We do not hope that the municipal government will use the blood and sweat of countless people to adorn unnecessary educational scenes. Therefore, we propose the following measures for public deliberation: Measures (1) The Experimental Drama School and Experimental Public School, etc., should be abolished immediately, and the remaining school buildings should be converted into national schools. (2) The Municipal Art Normal School should be abolished immediately, and specialized normal schools should be merged with other normal schools. (3) The Music Center Station, Art Center Station, Labor Center Station, and Science Experimental Branch, etc., should be entrusted to various schools, institutions, and organizations to manage concurrently, or directly abolished. They should not be independent institutions. (4) Other matters that should be delayed or can be merged should be investigated and merged separately. (5) All expenses saved by abolishing unnecessary institutions should be used entirely to develop national education.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Wonderful Tactics Displayed in Full; Qunsheng Defeats the Dongfang Team Again <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Sixty to Thirty-Eight, Almost Double; Qunsheng Wins All Three Games; Veteran Players Submit</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Qunsheng Basketball Team played its third game against the Dongfang Team in Shanghai yesterday. The Dongfang team, a disunited group lacking coordination, fought valiantly, but Qunsheng fully displayed its exquisite tactics. The veteran players of the Dongfang team were helpless. As a result, Qunsheng won again by a large margin of 60 to 38. The score at halftime was 30 to 20. Given the Dongfang team's appeal yesterday, the gymnasium was packed with people, far exceeding the previous two games. It was the first grand occasion for the visiting team in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Inexpressibly Wonderful</p>
<p>Qunsheng's performance yesterday was even better than the previous two games. Chen Jinde planned from the center, using screen plays. The two forwards were like butterflies dancing among the flowers, comparable at the top and bottom of the basket. It was truly wonderfully indescribable. Cai Wenhua and Cai Wenzhang's relaxed and accurate shooting won applause, and the harmony of the entire team during offense and the speed during defense can be said to have been fully displayed. No wonder the Dongfang team lowered its head in submission. The team's spirit was also highly commendable. There were also some displays of dissatisfaction with the referee, which we hope the players will correct. If there were no problems, then continue to encourage.</p>
<p>Leading from Start to Finish</p>
<p>The game started on time. Qunsheng sent Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, Chen Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, and Yang Renhui to the court. Dongfang countered with Ren Xiangcheng, Tang Baokun, Qin Xunze, Wang Nanzhen, and Liu Jingxing. After the start of the game, Qunsheng's Cai Wenhua scored twice, taking the lead. Dongfang fought hard, and Liu Jingxing and Qin Xunze tied the score at 4 each, then at 6 each. After that, Qunsheng used high-speed fast breaks and took the lead in each quarter. The Dongfang team only followed behind. The score at halftime was 30 to 20, with Qunsheng leading by ten points.</p>
<p>In the second half, both sides made substitutions. Cai Lianke of Qunsheng replaced Cai Wenzhang, and Zhang Shaoqing replaced Liu Jingxing. Ren Xiangcheng scored first, but it was a fleeting moment. Qunsheng then used its prowess again, and Cai Wenhua's accurate shooting from a hundred paces and his following up under the basket gradually widened the score difference, 46 to 23. The Dongfang team frequently adjusted its fresh troops to counterattack. By attacking with strength, Qunsheng substituted Zhang Yuyi and others. Dongfang chased hard, once making it 45 to 34. Qunsheng quickly used its ideal lineup, and the difference widened again. Later, Yang Renhui committed his fifth foul, but before long, the whistle blew. Qunsheng won all three games with a score of 60 to 38.</p>

<h3 id="e99">The Rumors of Foreign Exchange Readjustment are Baseless; President Bei Claims to Have Heard Nothing About It; Efforts are Being Made to Curb Capital Flight to Hong Kong <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Bei Zuyi, president of the Central Bank, told our reporter yesterday that the rumors in the market that foreign exchange will be readjusted again are purely baseless. Regarding the rumors in the capital that the relevant parties have drafted a plan to adjust foreign exchange by making frequent adjustments of small magnitude, he said that he had not heard anything about it and did not know what "relevant parties" were referring to. He said that, in short, all the recent rumors about foreign exchange in the market are completely unfounded. He is unwilling to comment too much in the newspaper so as not to provide materials for speculators to quote out of context.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of capital flight to Hong Kong, he said that efforts are being made to find ways to curb it. He hopes that the people will abide by the law, which would be of great help.</p>
<p>The Central Bank will hold a working conference in the capital on Double Ten Day (October 10th). He said that this conference had not been held for a long time due to the impact of the war. This gathering will be attended by representatives from branches and offices across the country to brainstorm, exchange ideas, and study how to improve operations so that the Central Bank can become the bank of banks. At the same time, they will discuss how to communicate the business of headquarters and branches, and domestic remittance issues.</p>

<p>The Central Bank, noting that a large number of merchants have applied to designated banks to postpone the delivery of foreign exchange sold on a forward basis, yesterday issued a circular to designated banks stipulating the following in detail regarding applications for postponing the delivery of foreign exchange:</p>
<p>(1) Merchants purchasing foreign exchange, except as provided in item 3, must have written documents proving the purpose of the purchase. These documents must be approved by the designated bank. The designated bank should pay close attention to its own responsibilities when reviewing the above applications.</p>
<p>(2) For imported goods, except as provided in items 3 and 4, there must be an irrevocable letter of credit or authorization to purchase (Irrevocable L/C or A/P) guaranteeing payment, unless otherwise permitted by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>(3) The above regulations may be separately negotiated for long-established importers with established payment practices, and the required amount shall be approved periodically according to their needs.</p>
<p>(4) For import bills of exchange collected by banks exceeding US$500 C.I.F. or its equivalent, the designated bank must first obtain permission from the Central Bank before selling the foreign exchange.</p>
<p>(5) The points listed in this circular do not apply to imported goods for which the provisions of Circular No. 26 of April 4th of this year are still valid.</p>
<p>(6) For foreign exchange sold on or after August 19th, if it is not settled upon maturity, the designated bank may cancel the transaction at the market price on the date of sale on the due date. The cancelled foreign exchange must be resold to the Central Bank at the original purchase price.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Quiet Bond Market <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, public bonds remained difficult to rally under sporadic retail sales. The overall level opened at 1800 yuan, and the highest price was only 1850 yuan. It fell to 1760 yuan in the middle of the day and hovered between 1780 yuan and 1800 yuan at the close. The process was extremely quiet, with no special changes. The trading volume was only over 2 million yuan. As a result, Class A, B, and C bonds each fell by 80 yuan compared to last Saturday, while Class D and E bonds fell by a small amount of 60 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Sluggish Stock Market <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The foreign stock market remained in a state of decline and could not recover. Securities dealers were shaken. Except for steel stocks, other stocks showed signs of wavering. Ewo Yarns fluctuated quite a bit. It opened at 8600 yuan in the morning and fell to 8000 yuan before recovering. As a result, compared to last Saturday, steel stocks remained unchanged, Jardine Matheson and Amoy Paper slightly declined, Ewo Yarns, Ewo Brewery and China Merchants Steam Navigation fell by half a percent, and British American Tobacco fell by a weak 10%.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Settlement Funds Arriving in Succession; US Dollars Reached New Highs; Shanghai Gold Followed the Trend <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Gold initially stabilized yesterday. At high prices, there was considerable pressure, and there was a lot of struggling. It opened slightly lower in the morning at around 2.175 million. After opening, many floating longs came out of the market. Disappointed buyers gradually fell from 2.178 million, with small declines. After 10:00 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 30 bars at a price of 2.165 million, and this could not be revived and could not be boosted. It once fell to 2.15 million before noon, but at noon, US dollars suddenly became popular again, and the price of gold rose sharply to about 2.175 million. In the afternoon, it was again stimulated by the rush to buy US dollars, rising to over 2.19 million before falling back slightly. The result was similar to last Saturday. Gold ornaments, silver bullion, and silver dollars were all flat. The black market interest rate remained at around 1.3%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies initially weakened and then recovered. US dollars opened at 3750 yuan in the morning, and there was an outflow of settlements. Generally, floating longs from the previous week had their settlements. The price fell to 3640 yuan in the middle of the day before stabilizing. At noon, the trend of scraping settlements was prevalent again, and it surged to over 3800 yuan. In the afternoon, under the double pressure of settlements and those freezing foreign exchange, preemptive purchases pushed the price close to a high of 3900 yuan at the close. As a result, it was 110 yuan better than last Saturday, and the ratio to gold was 562 yuan per tael. Hong Kong banknotes initially stabilized and then became popular. They were even stronger in the afternoon. Generally, those who did not obtain US dollars scrambled to collect them, and the price also rose by 20 yuan, with Hong Kong exchange at 760 yuan and Indian exchange at around 920 yuan, with few sellers. British exchange was over 12,000 yuan, and US exchange was out of stock.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Stock Exchange stipulates that the guarantee deposit for brokers is 50 million yuan each for the bond and stock markets. Apart from the 40% cash portion, which was notified to the brokers for payment on August 27th, the remaining 60% of securities and real estate for replacement had been submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Economy by the Exchange on August 24th for flexible handling. Now, the reply received stated: "Regarding the replacement portion of the guarantee deposit, flexible handling may be tentatively approved. Several member banks of the Shanghai market designated by the Central Bank will still be used. The brokers will contact these banks themselves to submit written guarantees as replacements. Each broker must replace this guarantee with replacements within one month from the opening date of the Exchange." The Exchange has complied.

<h3 id="e106">Allotted Yarn Rose by 70,000 Yesterday; Still Cheaper Than the Black Market; Yarn Sales Slightly Sluggish; Cotton Cloth Prices Soaring; Not Much Supplied by the Joint Textile Construction Company <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market rebounded and fell. Although the asking price was high in the morning, there were few buyers, and the price could not be sustained. This was because the price had risen significantly on Friday and Saturday of last week, and buyers were watching and making few purchases. The multi-sellers also made profits and sold off, so the price went down. 42-count and 20-count yarns fell by about 40,000 to 100,000. The decline in 16-count yarn was limited, and the opening price was around 1.557 million, almost at the same price as 20-count yarn, which is rare in the yarn market recently. Yesterday morning, futures for eight types of yarn were listed by the Joint Textile Construction Company, using a joint distribution method. The prices were not announced until around 7:00 p.m. (see the Market Prices section).</p>
<p>Application for Reduction; Allotted Price Increase</p>
<p>After the resolution that the total amount of the second group allotment of yarn to national and private yarn factories would still be 30,000 bales, the Joint Textile Construction Company was responsible for 12,000 bales, and the private factories were responsible for 18,000 bales. Yesterday afternoon, the Yarn Factory Joint Distribution Committee held its first opening of yarn. It was not until after 5:00 p.m. that it was decided to sell 905 bales of 20-count cotton yarn according to the standard amount of private factories, which was allotted at half the applied amount. In addition, 2,644 bales were sold due to the working capital of each factory before the second group of 30,000 bales of yarn was sold out after the first group allotment. These bales are now also included in the total amount of the second group allotment of 30,000 bales. However, the allotment price is still calculated at 1.35 million yuan per bale. In addition, the Joint Textile Construction Company allotted a total of 1,625 bales yesterday (however, the Joint Textile Construction Company said that 1,501 bales were allotted). The amount applied for, including various colored cotton yarns, totaled 7,567 bales. The opening price yesterday, based on 400 pounds of 20-count cotton yarn, was increased to 1.43 million yuan per bale, an increase of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous opening price. Considering the market price, the allotted price is still about 7% lower.</p>
<p>Association Notice; Eight Measures</p>
<p>The provisional measures for the sale of cotton yarn by each yarn factory decided at the meeting are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>1. Customers purchasing cotton yarn are temporarily limited to the original customers of each factory, and applications from end-users are given priority.</p>
<p>2. The above-mentioned end-users who have a genuine need to purchase cotton yarn should first fill out an application form to the yarn factory they have been dealing with, stating the count, quantity, purpose, etc. of the cotton yarn they intend to purchase. The amount filled in by the customer in the application must be limited to the actual need. If there is speculation or false reporting, each factory may reduce or cancel the applicant's qualification.</p>
<p>3. After each yarn factory receives and reviews the purchase application, it will determine whether the applied quantity is accurate based on past yarn purchase records. If it is untrue, it should be corrected at any time and sent to the association before 12:00 noon every day for decision. Before 4:00 p.m. on the same day, the quantity and standard price (based on 20-count cotton yarn) decided by the association will be notified to each yarn factory and passed on to the applicant. Each yarn factory and applicant must not increase or decrease the decided quantity and price on their own.</p>
<p>4. If there is a surplus in the amount of cotton yarn to be sold by each factory, the association will distribute it on its behalf.</p>
<p>5. After receiving the notice, the applicant should immediately sign a sales contract with the factory and pay the full amount of the goods in cash the next day.</p>
<p>6. When selling cotton yarn, each yarn factory must weigh 400 pounds for each large bale and 10 pounds for each small bale, and no additional small branches are allowed.</p>
<p>7. The cotton yarn decided to be sold should be dispatched as soon as possible within ten days from the date of payment.</p>
<p>8. If the applicant fails to fulfill the contract or make payment after receiving the decision notice, the association may cancel its application qualification.</p>
<p>Peak Season; Cotton Cloth Soars</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market continued to soar. Although sales to various regions were declining, sales in the city were particularly strong. This was because it was the peak sales season, and the number of retail sales in the city was high, so buyers continued to come. Due to the inability to purchase spot goods, and the supply from the Joint Textile Construction Company has increased prices invisibly since the adoption of the joint distribution method, but the supply is still limited, so they have to drop into recent futures for adjustment. Yesterday, the opening price of high-end greige cloth was about 80,000 yuan, pure wool serge was about 85,000 yuan, and pure electric light twill was 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Market Selling is Rampant; Chinese Stocks are Weak Across the Board <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks fell yesterday. Wing On Yarns was purchased by Cantonese, so the situation was relatively stable. When the market opened in the morning, the hot stocks were more colorful, and were above the afternoon close on Saturday. After opening, the two major hot stocks, Wing On Yarns and Meyer, were also participated in by new multi-sellers, and were once popular. However, Bei sellers forced Meyer, and Wing On Yarns was also subjected to universal cutting due to the unfavorable situation. Even with the absorption of Guangbang, such as No. 184, it was difficult to stop the selling pressure, and the process was only slightly more stable than Meyer. Later, Meyer experienced more and more incremental declines, and panic was even worse. In the middle of the day, there was a lack of maintenance, and buyers were helpless. As a result, the entire stock market was shrouded in gloom, and the weakness was even worse. Although China Silk had a small number of chips, the rebound was extremely limited. At the close, there were short positions profiting, and there was a slight rebound. As a result, compared with the previous close, Wing On Yarns, Sincere Co., China Silk, New Asia, Five Harmony all showed a slight decline, Meyer, New Kwong, Ching Foo, Chuen Hing, Tung Yih, China Textile, Tatung, Wing Fung and Match all fell by about half a percent, China Flour alone fell by 1.5 percent, and Cement fell by a weak 10 percent. The total transaction volume was 6,014,400 shares, of which Wing On Yarns accounted for 3,090,000 shares, Meyer 280,000 shares, Ching Foo more than 800,000 shares, New Kwong and Chuen Hing three to five hundred thousand shares, and the rest were sporadic transactions. Off-market stocks also fell by about half a percent.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the rice market fell as the sky cleared and the source of indica rice was continuous, and digestion turned weak. Various types of indica rice fell by a small amount of one to two thousand yuan, and white yuan fell by two to three thousand yuan. However, the delivery of new japonica and old japonica was scarce, and the situation was still stable. It is estimated that the registration of goods from the north and south markets was more than 11,000 stones. There was no market for flour yesterday, and there was no transaction for wheat bran. Soybean arrivals and sales were strong, and Shantou and Quanzhou were quite happy to accept them, and the price rose by 2,000 yuan. The Fujian side had a strong appetite for wheat, and the price rose step by step, adding another thousand yuan. Raw peanuts were accepted by Nanyang and this city, and demand exceeded supply, and they continued to soar by six to seven thousand yuan. Red sorghum was scarce and expensive by a thousand yuan, mung beans were high and stable, broad beans rose by a thousand yuan, and the oil market had mixed gains and losses. Raw oil had a lot of goods, and the price fell by another thousand yuan, soybean oil was strong, rapeseed oil rose slightly, and soybean cake rose by three to four hundred yuan.</p>

<p>According to a responsible person from the Jianghai Customs: More than 100 wharves and warehouses received by the Customs have been cleared of enemy and puppet materials, and they have been returned to the original owners. Only a few areas in the city center are still awaiting clearance, and they can also be returned by the end of this month. Currently, imports and exports have not yet been expanded due to transportation relations. There are very few goods in each warehouse, and everyone feels that business is bleak.</p>
<p>Regarding theft incidents, the Customs is making every effort to prevent them, strengthening defense forces, and will restore maritime anti-smuggling ships. Once the allocation is approved, an anti-smuggling team will be established. Currently, maritime theft has been controlled, but theft at wharves and warehouses is beyond its power.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Commercial Banks Organize Loan Groups; One Group Has Been Established <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The loans for factories and exporters organized by the Central Bank are not limited to money shops. Commercial banks can also organize industrial and commercial loan syndicates to apply for re-mortgages from the bank. It is reported that the banks have organized separately according to the bank's methods. The first group has been formally established, with 10 banks participating, including Guanghua, Qiantai, Guangzhong, Dunsui, Minfu, Dalai, Bachuan, Huamao, Yongtai, and Guofu. The loan quota has been sent to the Central Bank and will be signed in the next few days. In addition, 17 banks from Sichuan, including Sichuan Salt, Sichuan Kang, Chongqing, Meifeng, and Juxingcheng, and 7 banks, including Women, Yongxiang, and Coal Industry, are also being organized separately. The second and third loan syndicates can be formally established soon.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Alarming Handling Fees: No Set Amount <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>According to the transportation industry, the handling fees for goods at various wharves recently are truly alarming. A few days ago, Sullivan Company transported 12,000 bags of flour from the United States. It cost a total of 6.25 million yuan to transport the flour from the ship's hold to the warehouse. The shipping companies also have no set amount for this fee and must be paid in advance before the goods can be picked up. In addition, when the cargo owner ships goods from the warehouse within ten days, they must pay another 300 yuan per bag. Based on the 12,000 bags of flour alone, the external fees from picking up the goods from the ship's hold to the warehouse to shipping the goods from the warehouse exceed 10 million yuan.</p>

<p>In the coal market, anthracite coal lumps continued the previous trend, and market prices rose sharply again. Anthracite coal smalls followed suit, and anthracite coal dust remained flat. The price of screened lumps of bituminous coal rose slightly due to the allocation of the Fuel Management Committee, and the Kaiping train screened lumps at the Maigen Road stack in Puxi were of soft and inferior quality.</p>

<p>— Xu Riqing</p>
<p>(3) Implementation of Comprehensive Income Tax</p>
<p>The classified income tax system previously implemented in our country levied taxes based on income sources, such as profits from enterprises, interest from deposits, and rental income from properties. Therefore, it could be called an income tax. It failed to meet the principle of fairness based on ability to pay. Comprehensive income tax, on the other hand, taxes all income, hence its alternative name, general income tax. It uses the individual taxpayer's income as the calculation unit, and is therefore also called "from-name" tax, which means that all kinds of income of each taxpayer are added up to form total income, and various expenses are deducted from the total income, which is then used as the standard for taxation. For example, France, in implementing comprehensive income tax, stipulates that all people within French territory with an annual income of more than 7,000 francs must pay this tax.</p>
<p>Article 3 of the new income tax law stipulates that, in addition to the classified income tax levied according to the previous article, an additional comprehensive income tax shall be levied on individuals whose total income exceeds 600,000 yuan. The calculation method is to combine all kinds of personal income for the whole year to form the total income, but the following items can be deducted: 1. 100,000 yuan for each family member living together, or relatives who must be supported; 2. 50,000 yuan for each family member who is a student in secondary or higher education; 3. Various income taxes and land taxes already paid (Article 19 of the same law). The reporting method requires taxpayers to report the type and amount of their income in the previous year to the competent collection agency before May 1st each year. The competent collection agency and district, township, and town offices, or central primary schools, establish a joint reporting committee for review (Article 26 of the same law), to prevent the malpractice of false reporting or non-reporting.</p>
<p>In the past, our country used the pretext of lax household registration and incomplete statistics to avoid implementing the comprehensive income tax. This time, the resolute decision to implement it is not without good reason. In the future, there will inevitably be many difficulties in collecting the comprehensive income tax. As the saying goes, "Human power can overcome nature." It is expected that there will be a day to overcome these difficulties.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the comprehensive income tax, people in society and in the media feel that it is redundant. In fact, the classified income tax is a tax on income, while the comprehensive income tax is a tax on people. There is absolutely no redundancy, because the targets are different. The comprehensive income tax best embodies the principle of ability to pay. At the same time, a progressive tax system must adopt progressive tax rates. Our country's classified income tax is limited by the environment and insufficient conditions, and has failed to exert its effectiveness in making those with more income pay more, and those with less income pay less. Taking securities deposit income as an example, it is unreasonable to levy 10% on both 10,000 yuan and 10 million yuan of deposit income. Therefore, the government adopts comprehensive income tax to make up for its deficiencies and prevent wealth from tending to concentrate. The original intention of the legislation is perfect. Whether the implementation can be smooth remains to be seen through the efforts of those in charge. Furthermore, considering the advanced countries, countries that first levy classified income tax and then levy comprehensive income tax include France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Moreover, the tax rates of comprehensive income tax in various countries are higher than those in our country. For example, the United States levies a minimum of 13%, the United Kingdom 10%, and Japan 10%. The United States levies a maximum of 72%, the United Kingdom 45%, and Japan 60%, while our country levies a minimum of 5% (that is, for those exceeding 600,000 yuan) and a maximum of no more than 50%.</p>
<p>(4) A Major Prerequisite—Economic Stability</p>
<p>The content of the new income tax law promulgated this time has taken into account the actual situation and objective needs, and is gradually moving towards a rational path, which is gratifying. However, only four months have passed since the promulgation of the new income tax law. Due to the daily depreciation of currency and the rising prices of goods, all the provisions seem to be outdated. Taking only the starting point of the comprehensive income tax in the new income tax law, it is already too low. It is said that this starting point was based on the pre-war Shanghai living survey data and the result of calculating the retail price increase of 2,220 times in September of the 34th year of the Republic. According to the Shanghai Important Commodity Retail Price Index compiled by the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, Shanghai's current prices in June of this year have increased more than 3,700 times. Now, after three months, plus foreign exchange adjustments, prices have risen, estimated at 4,000 times, or even 10,000 times. In contrast, all suffer from the disease of being outdated. Other provisions, such as the tax exemption points for salary and remuneration income tax, are also the same. Therefore, all good laws and good intentions must be under one major prerequisite—economic stability—before they can be effective. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e114">Journey to Northern Jiangsu (6): The Shadow of Blood on the Eastern Battlefield of Taixian <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Hang Zhou</p>
<p>Taixian Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 10th</p>
<p>There are two long dikes in northern Jiangsu, which are well known to people: on the left is the Grand Canal dike, and on the right is the Fan Gong dike. The area between the dikes is a large swampy region. In the past, people had to fear every year that floods would wash away the Grand Canal dike, turning this area into a marshland. Since the Communist Party's army came to northern Jiangsu, people's fear of floods has been transferred. There are too many examples to prove that wherever the Communist army goes, it becomes a "sea of blood." "Sea of blood" is a more terrifying term than "flood"!</p>
<p>The terrain of northern Jiangsu restricts military activities, so battles take place either on the Grand Canal dike or on the banks of the Fan Gong dike. When the battle of Shaobo was in full swing in late August, the Communist army launched a sudden attack on the right wing. Places such as Rugao, Haian, Qutang, and Huangqiao once again saw the unfolding of battles, and the people who had just returned home once again embarked on the path of destruction.</p>
<p>As a result, the center of gravity of the battle quickly shifted to the right. The Communist army's offensive was clearly not only in response to the left, but also had the intention of further capturing Liangtai and threatening Jiangnan. More than a month ago, the Communist army made such an attempt and was disastrously defeated. Now it has reorganized its forces, and the government army must naturally crush it again.</p>
<p>The Second Phase of the War - Episode 2</p>
<p>The situation on the right wing is dangerous, and the Communist army is rampant. Taking Haian as an example, the Communist army used twelve regiments to surround the National army, which was only one-fifth of its size. However, after fighting for more than a week, the Communist army could not move Haian by a single inch. Qutang and Da Xiaobaimi have already fallen into the hands of the Communist army. The situation in Huangqiao was once unclear, but fighting is still going on nearby. Within the pocket-shaped area from Rugao to Baimi in the northwest and to Huangqiao in the southwest, there are many mobile Communist troops. Major and minor battles are constantly taking place on the outskirts of Taixian and Taixing.</p>
<p>The right wing is "lively," while the left wing seems to be silent. On September 6, the reporter boarded a "chicken bus" running on the Yangtai Road in Yangzhou to take a look at the second episode of the second phase of the war in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The Yangtai Road is a major artery in northern Jiangsu at present. The National army has put a lot of effort into opening it up and maintaining it. There are many fortresses on both sides of the highway. These fortresses have all been stained with blood in front of them. Although they can no longer be seen now, I have seen, one by one, the smiles of the farmers who are harvesting the abundant rice crops, thanks to those bloodstains. Northern Jiangsu is having a great harvest year this year. The Chinese farmers who "rely on heaven for food" should have thanked God, but in Gaoyou, Baoying... in those so-called "liberated areas," how many farmers are still shedding tears over their harvest!</p>
<p>Universal Vigor and Energy - Acting on What is Said</p>
<p>After passing through checkpoints one after another, I arrived in Taixian. This is the reporter's second trip to Tai. Yangzhou is like a middle-aged woman, but Taixian is much younger. What I feel is universal vigor and energy. County Magistrate Ding Zuobin is a graduate of the 16th class of the military academy and was a guerrilla commander. He is a complete soldier. The district chiefs, township chiefs, self-defense captains, and even the secretaries and section chiefs in the county government are all related to the military academy and guerrilla warfare. They have gone through thick and thin together, and now they are also facing difficulties. They laugh and joke on weekdays, but when they work, they are really energetic and quick. Among the counties controlled by the National army in northern Jiangsu, Taixian can be said to be the one that can cooperate with the military. Repairing roads and building fortifications, they act on what is said. Ding Zuobin cannot sit idly in the county government office for three days. He likes to run around and see everything. Some things that need to go through four or five official procedures and take ten or eight days to resolve, he goes to the countryside himself and resolves with a single word.</p>
<p>The current soldiers are not all uneducated. Some have quite a good grasp of political cultivation. Ding Zuobin has the straightforward and enthusiastic character of a northerner. The people of Taixian are proud to have such a county magistrate. He said that he doesn't know how to be an official, only how to do things. He said to his subordinates, "Don't ruin my affairs."</p>
<p>Jiangnan is the land of fish and rice, while Jiangbei is the land of salt and rice. Both are equally rich. If Jiangnan and Jiangbei have different styles, the most obvious may be in the character of the people: Jiangnan is weaker, while Jiangbei is quite strong. Strong folk character with organization is a very good local armed force. The general feeling in northern Jiangsu is that the local armed force is not enough, but Taixian has quietly made quite a bit of progress. Every township has its own self-defense force, with more than 2,000 people in the county and more than 1,000 guns, which has helped the army a lot.</p>
<p>In the past two days, Dasizhuang, more than 20 miles southeast of Taixian and 18 miles from the Kukou Tai Highway, was attacked by the Communist army. There are no National army stationed there. The self-defense force resisted alone and did not allow the Communist army to gain an advantage. Ding Zuobin received the report and personally led 400-500 self-defense forces to reinforce the area, and drove the Communist army away at once.</p>
<p>Jiangyan is Close to the Frontline - Hearing the Sound of Machine Guns</p>
<p>On September 7, the reporter, along with Wu Xiaode, chief of staff of the 108th Brigade, and staff officer Gao Hongsheng, inspected the eastern battlefield of Taixian. Ding Zuobin also went along.</p>
<p>Departing early in the morning, we first arrived at Jiangyan. On the Taijiang Road, commercial vehicles disappeared, and military vehicles charged back and forth, quickly covering 36 miles. Jiangyan is a large town and market, a distribution center for grain. In previous years, the grain transport ships parked here were connected for three or four miles. This place is only ten miles away from Magou, the front line, and the sound of machine guns can be heard clearly every night. People are used to hearing it and are never disturbed by it. A bathhouse is still painting its facade and choosing an auspicious day to open. We didn't stay long and rushed to Magou.</p>
<p>Magou is a very important stronghold in the sense of defending Taixian. Since the Communist army launched its offensive, it has cut off the Taihai Road. On the night of August 29, it gathered more than two regiments and took advantage of the fact that the National army had just changed defenses to attack Magou directly, hoping to take it down in one fell swoop, threatening Jiangyan and coercing Taixian. The defending force of Magou was only one company, but this company was not flustered at all. "Fighting does not depend on the number of people." They defended calmly in the fortifications, hitting one when it came, and hitting two when two came. The Communist army surrounded Magou, charging again and again, and those who came up could not go back. Company Commander Zheng Yadong heard the Communist army's charge horn in the trench, which blew a total of 20 times. It can be seen that the 19 charges were all over, and the 20th charge could not avoid the final fate, and they also fell. The dark night passed in battle, and the enemy's gunfire died down. The brothers jumped out of the trenches in the light of the sun and looked: "Ah! So many corpses!" They were so excited that they forgot their fatigue and counted them. There were three or four hundred bodies.</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived at Magou, the brothers of Zheng Yadong Company scrambled to tell me about this wonderful battle. I deliberately dampened their spirits and asked:</p>
<p>"How many casualties did you have?"</p>
<p>"One died and four were injured," a soldier replied triumphantly.</p>
<p>One to four hundred, or five to two thousand (the total number of Communist army casualties), this record must make the Communist army grit their teeth.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the restless Communist army came to "avenge" every night afterwards, but every night they used corpses as gifts.</p>
<p>We once stood on a bunker to observe the terrain. I asked Battalion Commander Zhao Haiyun:</p>
<p>"How far is it from the Communist army's outpost?"</p>
<p>"At most half a mile."</p>
<p>"Isn't it dangerous?" I asked like a complete scholar.</p>
<p>"They don't dare—the Communist army comes out at night."</p>
<p>Parachutes Deployed - Supplying the Garrison</p>
<p>Back in Jiangyan, it was already 3 p.m. After resting for a while, when we were preparing to return to Taixian, a bomber flew over the sky, circling slowly, seemingly looking for a target. We had seen airplanes a lot, so we didn't pay attention to it at all. Suddenly, there was an exclamation all around: "Dropping bombs"! People shouted and ran. I was also taken aback. Looking up, several parachutes were floating in the sky, swaying as they descended. "It doesn't look like a bomb," I thought instinctively. "Bombs shouldn't be dropped here." But if it's not a bomb, it shouldn't be dropped here either. I thought again, "The plane must have mistaken the place."</p>
<p>The things dropped by the parachutes did not explode. "The plane probably mistook Jiangyan for Haian. The besieged garrison in Haian needs supplies." I thought further.</p>
<p>However, the plane did not realize its mistake. It continued to drop parachutes one after another, like lotus flowers. The villagers had never seen this thing before and rushed to the fields to search for it. Wu Zhifen, the commander of the 324th Regiment, ordered that all the dropped items be concentrated at the regimental headquarters for disposal.</p>
<p>At dusk, we surrounded Taixian. The brigade had contacted the air force and proved that the batch of things was to supply the garrison in Haian.</p>
<p>Although the siege of Haian has not been completely lifted, and the Communist army in other places is still harassing everywhere, the dangerous period on the wings of northern Jiangsu has passed after the National army's redeployment. The army and people of northern Jiangsu have faith. "Where did the New Fourth Army come from? Beat it back to where it came from!" A wild child adapted the song and sang it. The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming! "The round moon shines on all of China, some families are happy and some are sad?" The restaurants in Taixian started to prepare two days ago to enjoy this poetic and picturesque festival, but the displaced people have no home to return to, and look sadly at the bright moon, adding a lot of new sorrows!</p>

<p>Editor: The industry in my city of Wuxi has always been known for its development and is known as "Little Shanghai". The knitting industry in Wuxi also had a glorious history in the past, but since the victory, due to the dumping of foreign goods, the business has been in a slump. Especially due to the lack of working capital, it has had to borrow high-interest loans, and has fallen into a difficult struggle. We should ask the government to allocate industrial loans as soon as possible to alleviate the difficulties. Recently, I read in the newspaper that the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association has organized an industrial loan syndicate to provide relief to small and medium-sized factories. I hope that it can be realized as soon as possible, expand the scope of loans, and handle it fairly, so as to meet the actual situation and be universally effective. Also, the China Textile Corporation has always supplied yarn, but it has not yet sold it to the knitting industry in our city, which uses the most yarn. I hope that it will be implemented quickly to reduce costs and compete in the market. (Wuxi County Knitting Industry Association)</p>

<p>To the Shanghai Declaration and the health departments of all provinces of the Central Health Administration: This year, Shuangtao Quining Pills are very expensive. General speculators only know how to make profits, regardless of the lives of patients, and openly manufacture and sell fake pills for profit. The content of the pills is not up to standard, and some are even made entirely of powder, with not a bit of Quining in them. General informal pharmacies, general merchandise stores, and pharmacies in the interior all purchase them from vendors and sell them at the price of genuine brands, and the ignorant villagers cannot distinguish between genuine and fake, buy and take them, and they are ineffective, so that the genuine products also lose credibility. Selling and manufacturing counterfeit medicines in this way harms patients and misleads lives, which is really unforgivable. I hereby request your department to strictly order your subordinates to investigate and seize them, so as to warn evil people and emphasize hygiene. Very fortunate! (Doctor Yu Rubing)</p>

<p>At the intersection of Dihua Middle Road and Wuyuan Road in western Shanghai, there are vegetable stalls along the road, and the wheels of vehicles come and go, which is very inconvenient. In recent years, the population has been large, and residents are overcrowded when buying vegetables. In addition, the road is a major thoroughfare, and cars often encounter dangerous situations, and residents are very cautious when traveling back and forth. I think it would be better to build a temporary vegetable market on the large vacant land at the intersection of Linsen Road and Fuxing West Road in the east, using wooden boards, in the style of Nanshi South District Street. This equipment does not cost much, and you can also charge stall rental fees. Moreover, the land has been vacant for a long time, which can also avoid the accumulation of garbage, which is also beneficial to hygiene. It is said that the land was owned by the enemy and puppets, so I hereby suggest to the authorities that if it can be adopted, it will be beneficial to traffic safety and public health.

<p>The Shanghai County Government has transferred and registered land property rights because the county was occupied for eight years, and land property rights have been sold or transferred for the convenience of collection. Our office is in the county, but because the Huangpu River is separated, it is very inconvenient to travel back and forth (the county government is located in Minhang, west of the Huangpu River, while the fourth and fifth districts are located east of the Huangpu River). A special commissioner was sent to the district office to handle the matter, saving the villagers from traveling back and forth. The law is good and the intention is beautiful, but the handling fee is as high as 6,800 yuan per mu. And each room is calculated as one mu, and the houses in the town are calculated as two mu. The price is really unexpected? I heard that Chuansha County only charges 500 yuan per mu. Why is the difference more than ten times? (Hu Zhifu, Chenxing Town)</p>

We are all students, but this time we are not sent out by the school, but we are automatically sent out by our Three People's Principles Youth League. We hold the principle of contributing money and effort, so we have no complaints. On the evening of August 30, when we went to St. Taylor's in Central Tibet Road, the person in charge inside did not allow us to enter to promote national product vouchers. May I ask why he was not allowed to enter for promotion? May I ask if he is Chinese? We go out and run around in such hot weather to promote national product vouchers. What is it for? Is it for our own private interests? You must know that we are for the country, for the poor students, and not promoting to his employees, but promoting to customers who are eating coffee in their seats. Are they people without blood? Even their own motherland does not care, and asked us to go outside, and asked us to sign. We signed the Youth League and what school do we want? May I ask what they mean. They said: "You come in a class every three to five minutes, and you come in a class every three to five minutes, which is hindering our business." That's not true. Is it that we are happy to mess with your St. Taylor's and abandon the country for our own private interests? Besides, we did not hinder their business in any way. I hope that in the future, we will have less of this selfish and self-interested heart, and that this kind of phenomenon will no longer occur. Sincerely, the Third Fundraising Team of National Product Vouchers.</p>

<p>Editor: This time, my friend went to Su, and I asked him to write to me immediately after arriving in Su, but there has been no news. I thought that my friend had broken his promise, but I did not receive my friend's letter until the 3rd of this month. Looking at the date of sending the letter again, it was August 25. In the past, letters from friends on the Beijing-Shanghai Line only took three days, and Shanghai to Pudong only took two days. Now it takes three days from Shanghai to Pudong, and it takes nine days for letters from Suzhou to Pudong. I hope that the postal authorities will improve it as soon as possible. (Chen Ping)</p>

<p>— Huang Peiying</p>
<p>Knitted garments made of woolen yarn are exceptionally light, warm, and comfortable to wear, making them very popular. It seems everyone has one, so the knitting industry has a broad scope of activity and a bright future. Twenty years ago, I developed a strong interest in knitting. At that time, in addition to thoroughly studying various domestic knitting methods, I further researched Japanese knitting methods and gained some insights. Consequently, in 1928, I established a knitting training center and provided novel knitting methods along with knitting tools. Many people came to learn at the time, and the products were very well-received. The products were displayed at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce’s National Goods Exhibition and received a special-grade award and a gold medal. Later, due to the slow pace of handmade products, I referred to the needle machines used by the Japanese and invented and improved them, making the products three times faster than by hand. This type of needle machine was named the Woolen Yarn Knitting Machine and was granted a patent by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, obtaining a patent license. It was widely promoted at the time, but since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, this type of needle machine could not continue to be manufactured. Although there were plans to manufacture it after the victory, due to various reasons, it has not yet been able to meet readers this year, which I deeply regret.</p>
<p>However, hand knitting only requires carrying a needle and thread and can be worked on anytime, anywhere, which has its own convenience. The styles and knitting methods are constantly changing, and I intend to explore them with readers in this publication.</p>
<h3 id="e126">How to Knit a Woolen Sweater? Two Latest Styles <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Please look at Ms. Yan Huizhu, the queen of Peking opera. See how elegant and dignified she looks wearing this latest style woolen sweater, very beautiful and graceful.</p>
<p>Tools: Two Peiying No. 9 knitting needles, one sewing needle.</p>
<p>Materials: Two skeins of Shuang Mao (Double Cat) brand dark red, ten skeins of blue.</p>
<p>Stitches: Six stitches per pattern repeat.</p>
<p>Knitting method: Cast on 160 stitches, using a crossover pattern, knit to a height of six inches. Then knit one inch high in dark red, alternating one knit stitch and one purl stitch. At this time, decrease 52 stitches on each side using the decreasing method in Practice Diagram 10 (for the pocket opening). Separately cast on 48 stitches using two knitting needles, knit in stockinette stitch to a height of six inches, and knit two pieces in the same way (for the pocket flaps). Now connect these two pieces to the decreased sides, still using blue and the original pattern. Afterwards, decrease one stitch on each side every half inch, for a total of 22 stitches decreased. Continue to increase one stitch on each side every half inch, for a total of 32 stitches increased. At this time, start decreasing for the armholes, decreasing one stitch on each side every other row, for a total of 40 stitches decreased. Continue to increase one stitch on each side every other row, putting back the 40 stitches that were decreased (but starting from when the increase stitches, knit two inches high. At this time, decrease the neckline in the middle, first leaving 30 stitches in the center with a needle, now knit each side separately, leaving one stitch at the neckline on each row, until the number of stitches is sufficient at the armhole. The other side is the same).</p>
<p>Back piece knitting method: Cast on 86 stitches, knit eight stitches in alternating knit and purl on one side, the rest still knit in the same pattern as the front piece, to a height of five inches. Continue to decrease one stitch every half inch on the side that is not knitting alternating knit and purl, for a total of 15 stitches decreased. Continue to increase one stitch every half inch on the decreased side, for a total of 15 stitches increased. Then decrease the armholes in the same way as the front piece, to the same height. The knitting method for the other half of the back piece is the same (but on the edge where eight stitches are knitted in alternating knit and purl, a buttonhole must be made every three inches (i.e., increase one stitch, decrease one stitch)). After the front and back pieces are knitted, sew the front and back pieces together using the seam joining method in the back diagram.</p>
<p>Neckline knitting method: Use dark red to knit two inches high in alternating knit and purl for the stitches left around the neckline, then cast off, and sew the one-inch height to the reverse side to make it a double layer.</p>
<p>Armhole edge knitting method: Pick up one stitch in each hole around the armhole, for a total of 140 stitches, knit one inch high in alternating knit and purl (using dark red), the other side is the same.</p>
<p>Belt knitting method: Cast on 13 stitches with dark red, knit alternating knit and purl, to a height of 22 inches. Then decrease one stitch on each side every row, until finished, making it into a pointed end, the other one is the same. After knitting, sew it to both sides of the waist on the front piece.</p>
<p>There is also a latest 1946 woolen sweater. Its style is taken from this year’s American clothing samples. When worn by Ms. Tong Zhiling, a famous Kunqu opera actress, it looks even more beautiful and lively.</p>
<p>Tools: Two Peiying No. 9 knitting needles, one sewing needle.</p>
<p>Materials: Thirteen skeins of Bian Mao (Transforming Cat) brand four-ply wool yarn.</p>
<p>Knitting method: Cast on 150 stitches, using the same pattern as the back, but decreasing one stitch on each side every half inch, for a total of 40 stitches decreased. Continue to increase one stitch on each side every half inch, for a total of 32 stitches increased. At this time, start decreasing for the armholes, decreasing one stitch on each side every other row, for a total of 32 stitches decreased, continue knitting at same width until four inches high.</p>
<p>Front piece knitting method: Cast on 80 stitches, reduce by one stitch every half-inch on the back side, for a total of 20 stitches decreased. (But when the knit reaches 2 inches high, knit 16 stitches away on the side without decreasing stitches, from the 17th stitch knit 44 stitches two knit stitches and two purl stitches, measure one inch high, then these 44 stitches use practice chart 10 method cast off, this is the pocket opening.) Use two needles to knit 44 stitches to six inches in height, then connect them in the middle of the pocket opening where 44 stitches were cast off, and knit together with the original flower. After decreasing the 20 stitches on one side, continue to add one stitch every half stitch, for a total of 16 stitches added. At this time, armhole stitches should be cast off. Replace the flower pattern to cast off neckline stitches, decrease one stitch every three rows on the flat surface that is not increasing or decreasing, for a total of 20 stitches decreased, for the neckline. (But it must be decreased from the 11th stitch, because those ten stitches are the edge in the center. Refer to the back diagram for the flower-style knotting method.) Decrease one stitch every other row for the armhole, for a total of 16 stitches decreased, knit to the same height as the back piece. The knitting method for the other side is the same, but only the ten stitches on the front must be knitted five and a half inches longer, because there is no edge on the neckline of the back piece. When these ten stitches are knitted to five and a half inches long, sew them together with the ten stitches on the front of the other side. For the remaining stitches, the front and back pieces can be sewn together using the seam joining method in the back diagram.</p>
<p>Sleeve knitting method: Cast on 50 stitches, still knit the moss stitch, then add one stitch on each side every other row, for a total of 50 stitches added. Continue to knit 11 inches high without increasing or decreasing. Then in one row, decrease 40 stitches in the middle. (i.e., decrease one stitch, decrease one stitch, one purl stitch, and so on.) Leaving 60 stitches out of 100 stitches, continue to knit 3 and a half inches high with two knit stitches and one purl stitch, the knitting method for the other sleeve is the same. When sewing on the clothes, if the top of the sleeve is too big, it can be slightly puffed up on the shoulder blades.</p>
<p>Belt knitting method: Cast on nine stitches, knit the moss stitch to 28 inches high. Continue to decrease one stitch on each side every other row until finished, making it into a pointed end.</p>
<p>After the clothes are completely knitted, embroider any kind of embroidery pattern you like on the left side of the front piece, and the color scheme can also be as you like.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Washing and Preservation of Woolen Products <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Pei</p>
<p>Before discussing the washing method of woolen products, we should first know the characteristics of wool. The main component of wool, the fiber, has so-called outer scales, which must not be rubbed vigorously. If rubbed too vigorously, the fluff on the woolen yarn will form clumps, losing its original beauty. Woolen yarn has a very weak alkaline reaction, so high-quality soap must be used when washing, otherwise, the woolen yarn will easily become hard. If it is colored woolen yarn, and there is a possibility of fading when washing, the color must be fixed before washing. The method of fixing the color is to put one teaspoon of tannic acid and one teaspoon of acetic acid in one liter of clear water, mix them, put the item to be washed in and soak for five to six minutes, and then wash it.</p>
<p>Washing method: The washing method, the first thing to do is to remove the dirt, so rinse the detergent with clear water. After washing three or four times, put it in the soap water and push it up and down and left and right. After that, rinse with clear water and then use the sour wash method. The sour wash method has the effect of protecting the luster of the wool and preventing the wool from being damaged, so the sour wash method must be applied to woolen products at the end of washing. The method of sour washing is very simple. Half a glass of acetic acid or two glasses of ordinary sour vinegar can be put in one liter of clear water to make sour-tasting water. Put the washed item in and soak for five or six minutes, then take it out and dry it.</p>
<p>Drying method: The drying method cannot squeeze dry vigorously like other things. After sour washing, take it out and put it on a flat board to flatten it, then flatten the shape, and then slant the board and dry it in the shade to keep the item's original beauty.</p>
<p>Preservation method: As for the method of preservation, the most important thing is to prevent insect damage, and do not let the item change color and deteriorate. The first method of insect prevention is to completely wash off the stains before storing them, so that it can take effect. At the same time, the washed items must be fully dried and must be placed in a dry place. When storing, each item should be wrapped in paper separately, and camphor or mothballs should be placed in the middle, and they must be put in thin paper bags so that the powder of camphor etc. is not easily removed from the seams. After wrapping it up like this, put it in a cabinet or box, and then put the box in a dry, shady place, and do not let the sun shine directly on it, so that it can prevent discoloration and deterioration.</p>

<p>The "Women's Liberation" movement of the past decade or so has indeed had some women doing things that benefit the crowd, no less than men. But unfortunately, most women, especially those in cities, after being "liberated," not only still live a life of dependence, but even refuse to be as submissive as before, and only know how to enjoy rights without wanting to fulfill obligations, and have even broken the concept of "virtuous wife and good mother."</p>
<p>Children are the cornerstone of future society and the pillars of the nation. If we want to make the future country and society more perfect, we must do our best to develop children's education.</p>
<p>The education that children receive in schools is mechanical and limited, and teachers cannot follow students all day long to teach them at any time. Therefore, parents and teachers should bear equal responsibility for the education of children in their childhood. In school, it is up to the teachers, and in the home, it should be up to the parents. Especially mothers, because children have more frequent contact with their mothers than their fathers, there is no doubt that children's will and temperament follow the teachings and instructions of their mothers. In the corners of the city, it is easy to see that when a mother is preoccupied with gambling or playing outside all day, they easily give their children money and hand over the responsibility of care to servants, or let the children associate with the dregs of society. Of course, "one who stays near vermilion gets stained red, and one who stays near ink gets stained black." The children will learn everything: gambling, cursing...</p>
<p>Educating a child is like cultivating a flower or plant. If it is cared for by a diligent gardener who loves and plants it, it will always flourish. On the contrary, if it encounters a lazy gardener who lets it be exposed to the sun and rain without pruning its branches, there is no doubt that the flower or plant will wither.</p>
<p>Looking at the world's great people, their success has almost all been influenced by their mothers' hard work and teaching, because they can use their powers of observation to discern the psychology of children, grasp their emotions, and instill pure thoughts to nurture and correct them.</p>
<p>Of course, not every mother in the world can teach her children to become great people, but at least don't raise parasites that are of no use to society, the community, or the country.</p>
<p>May the mothers of the world take on this great responsibility!</p>

<p>(1) It's Not Just Like Roses</p>
<p>In my grandmother's garden there was a rose, which had already developed buds, but would not bloom for many days. This made me feel very anxious, because I was eager to see its beautiful petals and colors. I prepared to help it and asked it to bloom. With my grandmother's permission, I unfolded its petals one by one. Finally, the rose seemed to bloom, but it was not as beautiful and moving as I had seen before. Undoubtedly, the inherent beauty of this rose was destroyed by me, and it quickly withered and died. When my grandmother saw it, she said to me gently, "Everything is like this. Roses can only produce beautiful flowers in a certain order and at a certain time."</p>
<p>(2) The Lesson of the Basket</p>
<p>The six children in our family always liked to talk about other people's private affairs, gossip, and hurt others without benefiting themselves. Our father hated this bad habit. One day he brought back a package and said, "I bought each of you a small basket. When you have something to talk about, record it and put it in your basket. After the basket is full, check them one by one to see how much meaning there is." At first, we thought this was a ridiculous job, but soon we were very careful about what we said, and after a while, we simply forgot this bad habit of talking about others. Later, my father explained: "This little basket has acted as your monitor. Now you will no longer bring unfounded rumors from school, office, or factory to harm others. Although your basket is empty, it is more meaningful than when it was full."</p>

<p>— Translated by Gangren</p>
<p>No matter what you think; You are not the good wife you should be if:——</p>
<p>You tell your friends: "It's so annoying! My husband he..."</p>
<p>You dress up more carefully when you go out alone to a party than when your husband accompanies you to the movies.</p>
<p>You prefer to tell your husband how hard you have worked all day, rather than tell him how these work experiences have increased your pleasure.</p>
<p>When you want to chat with your friends, you leave your husband and family unattended.</p>
<p>You tell your husband the bad news at dinner, and not when you know your husband is in a good mood.</p>
<p>You are never satisfied with the house you live in and always want new things to make it more beautiful.</p>
<p>You decorate your "home" well, and seem to value your friends' praise more than the comfort your husband gets from it.</p>
<p>You have no interest in entertaining your husband's friends.</p>
<p>You would rather choose your own gifts than risk that he might buy you something you don't like.</p>
<p>You often say, "I want my husband to do this and that," instead of saying, "I hope he can do this and that, if he wants to."</p>
<p>You never let your husband be trusted with a certain opinion, until he has done it well.</p>
<p>You never ask your husband's opinion on anything. (Originally published in The China Pre)</p>
<h3 id="e131">How to Manage Servants <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>Any housewife in charge of a household must supervise her servants and maids at all times and see if their measures and actions are appropriate, and must not neglect them. The method of supervision should be based on common sense, and then when giving orders, one can be sure to act appropriately, so that the servants will obediently follow the rules and not act beyond the norm. The following are some points that housewives should be aware of. Readers should ponder them carefully and supplement them with experience, so that they can be handy and achieve the wonderful effect of commanding at will!</p>
<p>When selecting servants, only ask for diligence and simplicity, and be sure to examine their temperament to see if they can obey the master's orders. Do not judge solely on the basis of the level of wages. For sincere servants, diligent service is of no small benefit to the master, and it is appropriate for them to demand a good price. As for those who are lazy and undisciplined, who steal leisure and love ease, or who are stubborn and difficult to tame, even if the wages are low, the gains and losses will not be enough to offset them. Therefore, good servants are those who are diligent and thrifty, and who have a warm temperament and no heart of arrogance or flirtation. Conversely, management is not easy, and even if they have long skills, it is not appropriate to hire them, lest there be future troubles.</p>
<p>For people living at home, clothing and utensils should be clean and tidy, and so should servants. Gorgeousness is not appropriate, and damage and dirt also detract from elegance. Clothes are dirty and worn, not necessarily because of poverty, but mostly because of laziness and the unwillingness to wash and mend them. As the saying goes, "The work of one stitch, if sewn in time, is enough to save the labor of nine stitches." If servants do not know how to clean themselves, how can they be expected to be diligent in other things? It is like climbing a tree to catch fish, which is definitely impossible. As for flaunting clothes and dressing up, servants imitating their mistresses is also not appropriate. Those who are in charge should persuade them step by step, teach them to save, explain the advantages and disadvantages, so as to block their extravagant habits, and tell them that the amount of money earned by labor is very small. Regardless of whether it is blood and sweat, it should not be wasted at will. And those who make a living by labor sometimes stop working, or they may become old and sick and suddenly suffer from illness, and in every case, money is needed for support. If they do not save up on weekdays, when things happen, what can they rely on in a hurry? In short, all those who work for a living must be diligent and thrifty, and must not pursue extravagance. If clothes are torn, they should be mended, and must not be thrown away. The mouth and stomach cannot be indulged. As for shopping and socializing, they must also be restrained everywhere to save money and effort. As the old saying goes, "Saving a penny is like earning a penny." Otherwise, indulgence will never be satisfied, and one will inevitably fall into extravagance, and when the money is exhausted, one will have bad thoughts, and when one reaches the end of the road, it will be too late to regret the mistake!</p>
<p>The duties that servants should fulfill are numerous and cannot be enumerated one by one, such as cooking, washing, sweeping, and arranging utensils, and caring for young children. All of these are within their duties, but cooking and washing each have their own special duties, which cannot be fully covered by a brief list. Moreover, in wealthy families, there are many servants, and there are often cooks and women who each specialize in their work. Even if this is not the case, those in charge must also divide the work and cannot entrust it to one person alone. However, sweeping the house and tidying up utensils are usually the duties of servants. Now let us discuss them as follows:</p>
<p>Get up at dawn, open the windows and doors wide, and roll up the curtains to let fresh air into the room. If it is winter, and there is a stove in the room, the ashes and remaining charcoal must be removed first, and then sweep the room. When removing the ashes, the technique should be gentle, and the gold and porcelain items in the room, as well as the chairs and walls, should be covered with cloth to prevent dust from flying around. When sweeping the floor, first moisten it with water, which can also reduce the flying of dust. After sweeping, wipe the windows, and all glass cabinets and frames, as well as mirror frames, must be wiped. If there are copper or steel items, they should be wiped with soft leather to prevent them from rusting. If rust spots are seen, sandpaper or glue ash must be used to grind them, and they must be smoothed before stopping. Other items such as tables, chairs, and frames must be wiped one by one to prevent stains from remaining. All of these things should be done before the master gets up. Once the master gets up, the bedroom must be tidied up, the mattresses spread out, and the room swept and wiped as before.</p>
<p>If there are vases or water-filled basins in the room, they must be emptied and refilled with clear water every day.</p>
<p>Every few days, the quilts and mattresses should be taken out and exposed to the sunlight. Other things such as sweeping the stairs or beating the carpets must be done on sunny days and when there is free time, so as not to annoy the master. By the time it is evening, the windows and doors must be locked, and do not be lazy or forgetful, which is also the duty of servants.</p>
<p>Although the above discussion is only a brief outline, it must be guided properly in order to enjoy its effect. If there are any mistakes, they must be persuaded gently and shown kindness, so that the servants will return with gratitude and be sincerely convinced. Otherwise, even if you spend a lot of money, you will not be able to buy their loyalty, which is not the best policy.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Save the Unfortunate Children Made by Man <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xin</p>
<p>There are many unfortunate children in China. They are those who have experienced natural and man-made disasters, lost their parents at an early age, and some who have been abandoned and are wandering around. These unfortunate children should receive widespread sympathy from people.</p>
<p>But people have not noticed that in addition to these unfortunate children, there are more unfortunate children made by man. That is, when the fathers or mothers of children have affairs, the unfortunate fate of the children begins. In the current semi-feudal society, there are not many women who are mothers who have affairs, but it is more common for men.</p>
<p>My former ideal was that a sound marriage could definitely establish a happy family, so that the new generation would also be happy and excellent. But reality shattered my ideal. I have personally seen that among friends and relatives, they had a long and sweet courtship in the past, and their temperaments could not be said to be unknown to each other, and they were both intellectuals serving society. But after marriage, even ten or twenty years later, when the "green shade becomes a family tree full of branches", the hardworking mother is old and aging; but the father's career is gradually heading towards success. Generally, men who are fickle, when they have status and money, they get a concubine or mistress. They only see the new people smile, but they do not hear the old people cry. They never care about the destruction of family happiness, and they will not experience or imagine the psychological impact on the children, because they are becoming more and more alienated from the children.</p>
<p>Chinese women who have always been subjected to traditional etiquette and morality, even if they have been baptized by new ideas, they will never casually shout out divorce. When she is subjected to this unexpected blow, the gentle ones will silently entrust their hope and love to the next generation. However, this broken heart that has been stimulated will sometimes become perverted and unreasonably vent on the children, beating, scolding, and even ignoring them. And the children, facing this family shrouded in haze, their innocent and fragile hearts feel inexplicable hatred and jealousy. They cannot get the warmth of home, and they lose the great paternal love. Their young hearts are being devastated.</p>
<p>If the mother has a fierce and irritable temperament, she will definitely quarrel with her husband, and because of using revenge, she will wander outside all day, using theaters and dance halls to numb her heart that has lost its joy. As a result, these "fatherless and motherless" children are not well-fed and often suffer in winter. Besides messing around in the alley all day long, they simply no longer have a home. When they can occasionally see their parents, it is either a cold face like ice or fighting and quarreling. Under such family education, the spiritual and material education that children receive is perhaps even worse than that of orphans without parents.</p>
<p>If we want to educate an excellent second generation, we must hold fathers accountable for the majority of the responsibilities they should fulfill. Fathers should restrain their selfish lust and irrigate the newborn seedlings with great paternal love. I also hope that every woman can respect her own personality, strengthen your rationality, do not be seduced by men, being a concubine is dishonorable and lowly, without legal protection, and is despised by women of the new era. Moreover, destroying other people's families and harming the second generation of new China, you are committing crimes that harm society and the people!</p>
<p>We must save these unfortunate children!</p>

<p>— Mai Fo</p>
<p>Thomas Mann and "The Return of the Lover"</p>
<p>In the history of world literature, there is no greater giant than Goethe in terms of literary talent. For Chinese readers, everyone remembers his masterpiece "The Sorrows of Young Werther." This is an autobiographical novel of his, which, upon publication, was widely sought after, and many lovelorn youths committed suicide with a copy of "The Sorrows of Young Werther" in their hands.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1772, at the young age of twenty-two, the young Goethe went to Wetzlar, a town in central Germany, to practice law at the Imperial Court. At the age of sixteen, he left his hometown of Frankfurt and studied law in Leipzig and Strasbourg, during which time he fell ill and stayed at home. During his time in Leipzig, he fell in love with Käthchen Schönkopf, and during his time in Strasbourg, he was passionately in love with Friederike Brion, both of which ended in separation. These formed the model for Goethe's early love affairs, separations, and regrets. Now Goethe arrived in Wetzlar with a large number of poems, plays, sketches, and drafts in his possession, his mind full of ideals, ambitions, and illusions, and his heart full with pure passion, rebellion, and youthful melancholy. He had just finished writing his first play: "Götz von Berlichingen."</p>
<p>At the Imperial Court, Goethe met his former classmate Kestner, and through him, he met his fiancée Charlotte Buff, who was the housekeeper for her father and many siblings. The scene of their meeting, as written in "The Sorrows of Young Werther," was later versified by the British humorist Thackeray:</p>
<p>Werther loved Charlotte,</p>
<p>Words can never tell;</p>
<p>How you know he first met her?</p>
<p>She was cutting bread and butter.</p>
<p>But in real life, that meeting</p>
<p>was at a country dance.</p>
<p>Seventeen-year-old young Lotte,</p>
<p>wearing a white dress, trimmed with pale pink silk knots.</p>
<p>Thus the three of them, Goethe, Kestner and Lotte, spent an idyllic summer, Goethe initially yearning for the common love of friends, and later finally falling in love with Lotte alone, and finally falling in love with his own feelings as a poet and a lover. In the autumn, after receiving gentle advice from the other party, he abruptly retreated from the happiness at hand once again. Kestner and Lotte married, and soon after, a tragedy occurred in Wetzlar: another classmate, Jerusalem, committed suicide by shooting himself because of unrequited love. The effect of this foolish incident on Goethe was that he combined it with his own recent emotions, resulting in the novel "The Sorrows of Young Werther." After its publication, all of Europe was thrown into turmoil, and Goethe became famous as a result.</p>
<p>Forty-four years passed, and Goethe lived in seclusion in Weimar. Thackeray wrote another limerick in his famous work "Vanity Fair." But at this time, Goethe was already a great poet, playwright, novelist, politician, scientist, lover, privy councillor... His statue was placed alongside those of Napoleon and Beethoven; his house was a sacred place that pilgrims from all over the world must visit. He was, and still is, the greatest figure in Germany. His writings are vast, and his complete published works total forty volumes: plays, novels, poems, criticisms—almost every literary form. He wrote the most beautiful lyric poems in literature, and he wrote "Faust," a work to which he devoted his entire life. Even so, he still felt that he had not fully expressed himself.</p>
<p>And what about Charlotte—the female protagonist of "The Sorrows of Young Werther"—at that time? In contrast to Goethe's fame, she was unknown. She bore eleven children for her good husband, several of whom died young, and now she had been a widow for many years. When she was spending her old age in her sixties, she also led her children to the holy land.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the story "The Return of the Lover" by the deceased writer Thomas Mann. Lotte, an old widow in her sixties, with gray hair and a stout body, went to Weimar Temple with a daughter close to thirty years old. Although her face was completely changed, she still carried in her suitcase the self-colored robe with pink silk knots that she wore when she first met Goethe.</p>
<p>When she got out of the carriage and signed her name in the guest book of the White Elephant Hotel, she immediately attracted the attention of the head waiter, Mag: "Could this be Charlotte of the Buff family in Wetzlar?" He had already read "The Sorrows of Young Werther" thoroughly, and today seeing the heroine of the book, he was naturally fortunate. The news spread, and the hotel was surrounded by crowds admiring her demeanor.</p>
<p>Charlotte sent her daughter to her sister's house, and wrote a letter to Goethe, the words of which she had already rehearsed: My glorious friend:</p>
<p>I have come to visit my sister with my daughter Charlotte and will be staying in Weimar for a few days. It is my hope to introduce my daughter to you. As for myself, if I can meet again with my old companion, who is now world-renowned, I will be overjoyed.</p>
<p>Weimar, White Elephant Hotel, October 6, 1816.</p>
<p>Charlotte Kestner.</p>
<p>The next day, Goethe invited her to a banquet. Charlotte wore the white robe with red silk knots and sat next to Goethe. She could not speak. Although she was a vulgar woman, who had come only to say a few words to Goethe on behalf of her brother-in-law, at this moment, she could not speak.</p>
<p>The entire book has nine chapters, with more than one hundred thousand words; it is about two days, so what is written is all about the psychological states of Charlotte and Goethe. The reunion of a giant of a generation with an old love in his later years was just this ordinary meal!</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Night Watchman <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zhen</p>
<p>How does one while away the lonely long night! You ask, let me listen to the sound of the clapper, and then tell you:</p>
<p>When the venomous serpent of insomnia unveils the curtain of your heart, then, accompanying the mumbling of dreamers, the night watchman is your closest friend in the world.</p>
<p>A lamp traces a blurred shadow, a stick shatters the deathly silence of the night; forgetting the desire for "life," he knocks sweetness into the clapper; his simple, dull sound of the clapper spreads its wings, sweeping away the stars of the day; the fierce dogs in the alley seem to be kind to him, knowing that he is the messenger who urges people to have sweet dreams. But has a clever person explained "the greater self" and "the lesser self" to him? Has conscience told him about "selfishness" and "altruism"? Who does not love sweet dreams, who does not pity themselves? For whom should he be wandering in the night? Yet he silently bears the cross. Is this the reason why people can know him? Or is it what Providence can guess? Like casting off all the burdens of the mortal world, is this fate? Or does he still want to be the drummer of the times?</p>
<p>The perfect dream, although cherished by you, is only for him to squander with a clapper; the pain of insomnia, although you hate it, is ultimately brought back by the sound of the clapper. You often think he is foolish, but who in the world is not foolish? Even with regard to the arrangements of the Creator, or even one's own emotions and intellect.</p>
<p>In a foreign land or a place far from home, hearing the sound of the clapper, one almost feels as if one is in the small building of one's family. I love this sound of the clapper, which makes you feel longing from yearning. I cannot touch it, but I know that I am gradually approaching it.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Praise for a Portrait of an Orphan Girl <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Zi</p>
<p>What is painted here is a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old girl. Whether she is an orphan, I do not know, but I think it is very appropriate to call her an orphan. She must not have parents, otherwise she would never have lost the radiance of youth at such a young age. She is not beautiful, her expression is also dull, and even the backdrop and tone that set her off are a bit dark; but overall, this painting is very successful, giving us a very deep impression and making us feel a deep sadness. This kind of sadness can be intimately experienced by anyone who has lived in emotion and reflected on life. Moreover, when we gaze at this painting, our expression should be the same as that of this orphan girl, a kind of blank sadness.</p>
<p>Her hair is disheveled, her face is also very haggard, and in her eyes, one can see a kind of hazy darkness—she is a pitiful person. Obviously, she has given up the pursuit of beauty; this pursuit, perhaps she has never been aware of in her suffering life, or perhaps she has gradually given up in the face of constant blows and disappointments. Because every girl, regardless of ugliness or beauty, always hopes to express herself beautifully; but she does not have this hope, her facial expression is lax, her demeanor is too dim, and her eyes are already like those of a person who has experienced suffering, inclined to reflection and introspection. Such people can be said to be everywhere in our era, but until we saw this painting, we began to be surprised: we had not observed them deeply.</p>
<p>Youth is beautiful, but not many people can enjoy youth. Those who obtain youth do not realize it; by the time they realize it, youth has already slipped away in suffering. I once saw a painting in which the face of a wrinkled woman was faintly drawn in the ripples of water, with the title "Fleeting Time"—fleeting time, this girl who is only fifteen or sixteen years old has already lost the radiance of her soul. Could it be that in our suffering era, a dozen years have actually been worth forty or fifty years of a peaceful era!</p>
<p>Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" is a happy picture, in which we see a kind of joy of the soul; this joy is almost divine. But how many people can obtain this kind of joy? We all have our own dreams. In normal life, we realize these dreams; in adverse circumstances, we pursue them. But this lonely girl, her dreams seem to have been shattered. She must have cried sadly in suffering, and resented violently in disappointment. Now, everything is calm and quiet, she stares blankly—this is just a deep silence.</p>
<p>My love for this painting is a love for its subtlety and depth. Usually during the New Year, we can see many red and green figure paintings on the market. The colors of these paintings are very exaggerated, and the figures are also very numerous. For children, this is something lovely; for country people who grew up in a peaceful era, this is also very interesting. But in our opinion, it always feels like there is no life, no content, just some images floating on the paper. But if you open up this painting here and take a look, it reveals a suffering era, and also reveals a turbulent life!</p>
<p>For a teenage girl, life should be easy, but it is not. She is already disappointed. She has not received a higher education, and no one has guided her to transform this depression into the pursuit of a higher ideal. She only hopes to obtain a normal life, a normal life at the most basic level. She only hopes to obtain a little bit of the most ordinary warmth. But even this little hope cannot be obtained, so she is disappointed. This disappointment represents the endurance of all mankind towards life.</p>
<p>Finally, I am surprised that the author of this painting has such profound observational skills. She is always happy on weekdays. I thought she must not know what depression is. I thought her understanding of life must be superficial; but I was wrong, her observational skills are much deeper than ours, and her expressive techniques are so skilled. This shows that a person's daily expression does not necessarily represent his inner self. In this complex era, life is multifaceted after all.</p>

<p>— Dai Wangshu</p>
<p>Remember those happy days!</p>
<p>Daughter, remember in your young heart:</p>
<p>Your childhood was adorned with the colorful feathers of seabirds,</p>
<p>The pearly color of shells, the clear sound of tides,</p>
<p>The verdant green of mountain mists, the embroidered tapestry of flowers,</p>
<p>And the tenderness of your loving parents.</p>
<p>We once had a comfortable home,</p>
<p>Surrounded by the gurgling sound of spring water,</p>
<p>Basking in the sun in winter, shrouded in shade in summer,</p>
<p>Having friends during the day, and tranquility at night,</p>
<p>The years flowed outside the window, not disturbing</p>
<p>The joy that stayed in the house all year round,</p>
<p>If people glimpsed us talking and laughing under the lamp,</p>
<p>They would feel that it was worth living a lifetime just for this.</p>
<p>We once had a seaside garden,</p>
<p>It gave us nourishing tomatoes and golden bamboo shoots,</p>
<p>Your father would till the land when he was tired of reading,</p>
<p>Your mother would sew in the shade of the sun,</p>
<p>And you, you would chase butterflies in the grass,</p>
<p>Then seek tender dreams in a gentle embrace.</p>
<p>Everyone said we were the happiest,</p>
<p>Perhaps because we lived so foolishly,</p>
<p>Perhaps because your mother was gentle and beautiful,</p>
<p>Perhaps because your father's poems were the freshest.</p>
<p>But, daughter, that happiness was short-lived,</p>
<p>In an instant, it was all locked and buried in clouds and smoke;</p>
<p>You remember that our little garden faced the sea,</p>
<p>From there, you left and never returned,</p>
<p>Since then, I have been facing that distant horizon,</p>
<p>Often lingering under the pine trees until dusk.</p>
<p>Those dazzling days, like butterflies,</p>
<p>Now you waste your time groping and chasing,</p>
<p>As if seeing you go from this room of mine</p>
<p>To that room, waving away the shadows with your little hands,</p>
<p>Then, thinking of your father in the distance,</p>
<p>Resting your tired head on a small embroidered pillow.</p>
<p>But, remember those happy days,</p>
<p>Daughter, remember in your young heart:</p>
<p>Your father will still come, as in the past,</p>
<p>To guard your dreams, to guard your waking hours.</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>After hastily bidding farewell to Ding Yuan, I returned to the station with the three people who delivered the message, but the news was still shrouded in silence. "Maybe they'll launch tonight?... Maybe tomorrow?" I speculated. Who knew that just as it was about half past eleven, the signal from the radio in the closet sounded.</p>
<p>"Hey, old friend, lunch is ready, just waiting for you alone!"</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll set off right away," I replied.</p>
<p>"Lunch" or "breakfast" or "dinner" or "late night snack" etc., were the agreed-upon code words, referring to the preliminary launch by the Japanese. The meaning of "set off" referred to the sabotage work I was in charge of.</p>
<p>"631, 631, Headquarters," I began to send out the special agent common code telegram. The recipient was the Shenyang General Staff Headquarters. In less than two minutes, there was a response. I knew that the code had been connected, so I quickly sent out the pre-prepared telegram: "Top secret, the planned 'Trilogy' plan has been leaked, and the other party is prepared, 035 branch north." I used the Tianjin Radio code.</p>
<p>This was the cracking method that Wang Lengzhai and I had planned. The Japanese are very clumsy, narrow-minded, and suspicious; therefore, when there is a secret plan, they are most afraid of hearing the word "leak". If they hear that it has been leaked, regardless of whether it is true or false, they will definitely be flustered and cause a commotion; even overturning the entire plan. The cracking method I planned was based on this mentality.</p>
<p>According to my guess, after receiving this urgent telegram, the headquarters must immediately issue an order, instructing the Peiping special agent agency to stop the expected action, or temporarily change the method, or cancel the meeting.</p>
<p>Sure enough, about an hour later, our comrades at headquarters telegraphed, saying that the head of the headquarters was very angry after receiving the urgent telegram, and scolded the Peiping special agent host and the leaders of military and political activities, saying that they were simply bastards, and that even this important plan had been leaked. The responsibility for the leak was placed on Matsui alone. This guy was the idiot who accompanied me back to Changxindian last time.</p>
<p>However, if you say that he is really an idiot, that is not the case. Around six o'clock in the evening, we received intelligence that this guy still remained calm in the afternoon, and at the agreed time, he led Imai and a few other desperadoes, and more than a dozen good shooters, all the way to the Beiping Ji-Cha Committee Chairman's Office of the Jinde Society, on the one hand, to test how much strength was prepared in the Xingyuan, and on the other hand, still intending to do it recklessly. The meaning was that if a few were knocked down, they could also make up for their mistakes.</p>
<p>Who knew that when they arrived at Xingyuan, as soon as they entered the door, all the shooters were stopped. Although they were invited to have tea in the lounge, in reality, they were watched by more than twenty burly men in the guard room. However, this guy Matsui still did not give up, and still led Imai and three or five attendants, rushing to the guest room, specifically demanding that Song Zheyuan personally receive them.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>There are many stalls on the streets and alleys that rent and sell welcome loop pictures. At each stall, there are often crowds of children, ranging in age from eight or nine to ten years old, and even many adult women. Some people have likened them to street education, but this kind of education is dangerous.</p>
<p>The danger lies in the story content of these comic books.</p>
<p>This statement is based on evidence. Recently, there was a recent example:</p>
<p>At 5:00 AM on the 22nd, a blood case of a younger brother killing his brother and sister-in-law occurred on Beijing Road. The younger sister of the murderer said that the murderer usually liked to read comic books. On the evening before the murder, he was still reading the book "Emerald Screen Mountain." Unexpectedly, he imitated Shi Xiu and killed his brother and sister-in-law. So it may be poisoned by the comic books.</p>
<p>The story content of comic books mostly falls into the three categories of adultery, thieves and monsters, because they are expressed in pictures, and the cost is very low, and the distribution is extensive, so they are more popular and deeply rooted in the people, which has a great impact on society.</p>
<p>For the sake of saving the children, the authorities should actively ban them.</p>
<p>I have talked to the relevant authorities about this issue. According to them, they have long noticed it, but when banning them, the publishers of these books very righteously take out the licenses approved by the Ministry of Interior for registration and printing, which makes us feel quite embarrassed.</p>
<p>If the above is true, in addition to asking the competent authorities of this city to report the facts, we also ask the Ministry of Interior to thoroughly investigate. On what basis can these books and periodicals containing toxins be issued permits? Who is handling this matter? Are there any other circumstances?</p>
<p>Naturally, we also hope that those publishers will not lose their conscience and make this bloody money for killing people!</p>

<h3 id="e142">One Day We Will Go to the Moon <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Da Wei</p>
<p>(Editor's note: In today's era when all science is prepared for war, we sincerely hope that scientists can shift their interest in researching atomic bombs and germ warfare to researching the moon!)</p>
<p>To the naked eye, the full moon is just a bright plate with mottled shadows on it. This is the surface of the satellite: there are deserts, plains, mountains, volcanic rocks, valleys and craters. Most of the things commonly seen on Earth are on it, except that there are no lakes, oceans, and living things there.</p>
<p>Astronomers have carefully and accurately drawn the surface of the moon. They know more about the cracks, volcanic rocks, valleys, and plains on it than geographers know about the hidden places on Earth.</p>
<p>They also know about the conditions on the moon. The temperature difference between day and night there is very large. The daytime on the moon is equal to two weeks on Earth. The sun shines directly on the surface, and there is no air layer like on Earth to block it. As a result, the rocks get so hot during the day that they can boil water. Only in caves or in the shade of cliffs is it dark, and humans can live there.</p>
<p>The night on the moon is also two weeks long. The heat from the surface quickly radiates into the air, and the temperature may drop so low that any liquid freezes.</p>
<p>More serious than any difficulty is that there is no air on it. If a person goes from Earth to the moon without any precautions, it is easy to explode due to the air pressure in the body, just like some deep-sea fish come out of the sea too quickly.</p>
<p>To overcome these dangers, moon explorers should have special equipment. They need "moon clothes," a well-designed, completely closed and movable body armor that can supply air at the same pressure like a diving suit, and has other essential equipment for survival on the moon, such as temperature controllers and electrically operated equipment.</p>
<p>A Suit Weighs Seven Hundred Pounds</p>
<p>Such a heavy suit cannot be used on Earth. However, the gravity on the moon is almost only one-fifth of that on Earth. A man weighing one hundred and eighty pounds weighs only thirty-five pounds on the moon. A suit weighing seven hundred pounds on the ground weighs only one hundred and forty pounds on the moon. In order to protect the person, the suit needs to be heavy so that he can maintain balance and control his muscles.</p>
<p>It is hard to say what this seven hundred-pound suit will look like. It should have the strength to withstand an internal pressure of fifteen pounds per square inch. And it must be soft so that the person wearing it can move easily. It must have its own power machinery—perhaps a generator to adapt to the sunlight on the moon during the day and a storage battery for use at night. Its air conditioner must be able to continuously re-manufacture the exhaled air, add fresh oxygen, and then put it into the circulation supplier. It may have to be able to extract the moisture exhaled from the air and evaporated from the body, clean it and then supply it for use, because both water and air must be brought from Earth.</p>
<p>This moon suit must also have internal and external lights for use at night on the moon; and it must have heat insulators, heating and cooling devices for day and night needs. Motors and control devices to operate "arms", "fingers" and other surface working equipment, as well as wireless and radar equipment are for transportation, orientation and drawing. In addition, there must be food storage for the explorer to use when leaving the base, and other devices for health, comfort and convenient work are also essential.</p>
<p>If this kind of clothing can be manufactured (it seems there is no reason why it cannot be), then intelligent and determined explorers can not only survive in the short term, but also thoroughly investigate the moon.</p>
<p>The rocket engine capable of making this kind of moon trip must be at least twice as efficient as all the current ones. The aerial fire must have an amazing speed of seven miles per second, which physicists call the "liberation speed" of the Earth. This means that once the rocket reaches this speed, the engine can be turned off, and the rocket can be powered by the Earth. If aimed accurately, it can be shot to the moon.</p>
<p>What Time to Explore the Moon</p>
<p>The best time for the lunar expedition to reach the moon is in the moon's morning, so that the explorers can have two weeks of sunlight to adapt all their equipment and life to the local environment. The first thing they should do after landing is to prepare the rocket for its return. They can take turns going out to investigate. The driver should be stationed at the base to communicate with the team members who have gone out and the ground. Geologists and mineralogists go out to explore valuable metals and minerals, study the possibility of colonization, and bring back rocks from the moon for further research.</p>
<p>The results of the investigation should be reported to the Earth station immediately, to avoid any accidents that prevent the expedition from returning.</p>
<p>On the second moon day (that is, the 28th day on Earth), they can prepare for the return trip. A speed of seven miles per second must be prepared on the way to go, and only one-fifth of this speed is required when returning, because the "liberation speed" on the moon is one point four miles per second.</p>
<p>According to the above, the moon is a place worth studying. It may become a stronghold for the victors on Earth. It may become the first station in the planetary transportation system in the next century. (Translated from the September issue of Collier's Magazine)</p>

<p>— Li Xin</p>
<p>[Editor's Note: In our August 30th issue, we published Mr. Zhi Wei's "My Ideal Wife," outlining his criteria for his future spouse. Many readers responded to this question, and some even requested that their letters be forwarded to Mr. Zhi Wei, demonstrating the pressing interest of young people in matters of marriage. Here, we are publishing a selection of the letters received, which may serve as a reference for young people hesitating at the crossroads of love.]</p>
<p>When a person reaches a certain age, choosing a lifelong partner is an important matter; however, everyone has different ideals.</p>
<p>I believe that an ideal husband should possess the following qualities:</p>
<p>A dignified appearance and neat attire, but without excessive ornamentation; not one who worships current trends, rushing to buy glass suspenders and other such items. This is aesthetic beauty in appearance.</p>
<p>Free from bad habits such as "smoking," "drinking," "prostitution," and "gambling"; striving for the advancement of "intellect," "physicality," "morality," and "beauty." This is inherent beauty.</p>
<p>A strong body, lively spirit, and free from any inheritable or contagious diseases. This is physiological beauty.</p>
<p>Excellent knowledge, having received at least twelve years of education; courageous in service, with a spirit of self-sacrifice for others, and possessing clear judgment and independent thought. This is beauty in knowledge and behavior.</p>
<p>Only an "ideal husband" can marry an "ideal wife," do you agree?</p>

<p>— Xiao Wei</p>
<p>I lament the excessive "self-centeredness" of human nature in this world, which causes all kinds of conflicts and battles. Everyone has their own set of rigid beliefs and wants the world to follow and conform to them. Radical ideologues even resort to bloodshed to force the world to conform instantly, but the result is that humanity suffers before enjoying any benefits. I am deeply concerned about the issue of marriage, but I oppose both parties listing a series of conditions. Choosing a spouse should not be done haphazardly, but it's not entirely like buying something.</p>

<p>— Xu Yeye</p>
<p>Mr. Zhi Wei:</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I finally made up my mind to write this letter. In a mountain city still steeped in feudal colors, this act seems almost absurd, but for that very reason, please do not underestimate it.</p>
<p>Self-introduction:</p>
<p>I am a graduate of a vocational school. I love my work, and I never forget to learn, striving to understand the needs of my time a little more.</p>
<p>I dare only say that in my small circle of life, I can usually handle things calmly.</p>
<p>Would you, Mr. Zhi, care to elaborate on the three words "Truth, Goodness, and Beauty"? How can life be lived to attain the realm of "Truth, Goodness, and Beauty"? Regardless, I want my life to be simple, gentle, and free from gaudiness.</p>
<p>My face is very ordinary! Mr., the women here are all very simple, even more so than your five, six, or seven ideal traits, and I am no exception.</p>
<p>I can probably manage a small family well.</p>
<p>Traveling is my only hobby.</p>
<p>Based on the points above, whether or not there are major discrepancies with your criteria, I hope to become a friend of the opposite sex from another place. I have never been to a bustling metropolis, especially not Shanghai, which is known as a paradise on earth. I would like to get to know it through you. Although I have nothing to offer you, I can report on things that are not found in those glamorous places.</p>

Before the war, he built a residence near Hepingmen in the capital, covering eleven acres of land. However, on such a large area, he only built a few low bungalows, which are as different as clouds and mud compared to the majestic and towering Western-style houses of other dignitaries. At that time, the land and house cost only seven thousand yuan in total. Every time the sun set, inside this house, there was often an old farmer wearing short sleeves and barefoot, wearing a straw hat, holding a hoe, weeding and watering flowers, with a leisurely and content look on his face. It may be hard to believe, but this old farmer was the dignified President Ju.</p>
<p>Mr. Ju not only enjoys the life of a farmer but also calls himself an Australian. On June 14, 1936, he came to Shanghai with his wife and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. The registration used a false name, and the occupation was filled in as "farmer."</p>
<p>Deeply Understands the Art of Living</p>
<p>He dislikes seeing strangers but is happy to write calligraphy. He responds to requests for calligraphy from both acquaintances and strangers alike. He loves to learn horseback riding, and his favorite food is tofu.</p>
<p>Mr. Ju is from Guangji, Hubei, with the given name Juesheng. He studied in Japan in his youth. Speaking of Japan, there is a heartwarming story between Mr. Ju and the country: When Sun Yat-sen was traveling overseas for the revolution, Mr. Ju followed and stayed in Japan. Because Ju's wife, Ms. Zhong, was pregnant, and Mr. Ju was busy with national affairs, he felt burdened by having children. A Japanese friend, Kayanō Nagatomo, was willing to raise one of his daughters. From then on, Miss Ju was raised by a Japanese family, nurtured by Japanese education. Twenty years passed in a blink of an eye. Mr. Ju was occupied with serving the country and had forgotten about this matter until June 1936, when Miss Ju learned about her origins from her foster father Kayanō and returned to China. The reunion of flesh and blood was filled with indescribable joy and sorrow.</p>
<p>Mr. Ju now has one son and three daughters. The eldest daughter is Kayanō Nagako, who was raised in Japan and has married Mr. Zhang Ming. His son, Haoran, graduated from Tsinghua University and the Central Military Academy and is currently serving in the military. He participated in frontline combat during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>We want a commoner official like President Ju. People's first impression of him is: "Living with the common people." The "officials" we need in the future are this type of official. If we have a particularly good impression of President Ju, the only reason is because "he is a commoner."</p>
