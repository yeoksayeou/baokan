<h3>第三方面提出新建議　主要內容着重停戰　宣傳休戰辦法尙待洽商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕連日會外商談已漸具體化，第三方面人土自廿五日晚至廿六日午止，均在於個別訪問中。陳誠，吳鼎昌，邵力子，雷震諸民，均已分別接洽，就停戰及政治各項問題作詳盡之硏討。下午三時再就交行舉行會議，首先由各代表報吿分別訪問結果，並綜合加以研究。旋對第三方面之新建議，提出討論，結果對該項建議認爲可以成立。據民盟羅隆基稱：此項建議乃對停戰之方案，此與今日晚報所載其內容所稱點綫面一節，各方均未予證實。據息，該方案內容對整軍駐地一節，至爲詳盡，且對雙方意見均已顧及，同時除停戰爲主要內容外，對改組國府改組政院及憲草問題，均曾涉及。惟目前各方相約宣傳休戰，故其內容各方均不肯透露。第三方面今日會議至六時許始畢，擬廿七日與政府代表再舉行非正式會議，將以廿六日所決定之建議提付討論，並期待主席旋京，俾可請示，同時將與共黨代表進行晤談聽取意見，發展如何，將視一二日內雙方最高當局之表示，當可決定。政協政府代表及陳誠，吳鼎昌，陳布雷等十一人，廿六日下午六時在孫科寓邸舉行會議，由彭學沛，邵力子報吿昨晚對宣傳休戰談話會經過，且予以硏討，至八時許始畢。</p>
<p>〔本報甫京廿六日電〕「宣傳休戰」具體辦法，昨晚已討論竣事，共分三點。據聞內容惟因延安曁政府方面之指示尙未到達，故廿六日尙未能公佈。政府代表孫科今晚對記者稱：此項辦法在原則上自屬同意，惟技術方面尙有待硏究，同時先看共黨意見如何。至中共意見，則由李維漢於下午二時電話通知民盟羅隆基，吿以其中兩點業已同意，現正尙在請示延安當局中。</p>
<h3>周恩來訪晤馬帥　美調人靜待新建議發表</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕美國方面調人目前正靜待第三方面新建議之發表，使商談得以正式啓幕。今晨司徒大使因抱恙未與外界接觸。僅周恩來於上午十一時半往訪馬帥會談。事後據中共代表團發言人稱，僅爲普通拜會，無可塞吿。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿六日電〕中共代表周恩來廿六日與馬歇爾特使會談歷三小時餘，此間觀察家咸認周氏此次往訪馬使，足以反映第三方面人士斡旋和平未有若何成就，局勢雖似元進展，但據立法院長孫科談稱，絕對不感悲觀。蔣主席廿六日未按原定時間返京，致停止宣傳戰協議，未獲即行簽字。</p>
<h3>孫院長談話</h3>
<p>同時改組國府政院　事實上恐怕不可能</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕孫科廿六日晚答本報記者詢問時局最近進展，茲述如次：問。外間傳說中共對改組行政院有所堅持，政府態度如何？答·此事本已由政協決議，改組國府委員會與改組行政院均屬時間問題，同時改組似屬不可，因國府委員會似母親，行政院則爲其子，如國府委員會未改組完竣，如何能改組政院？沒有母親，那裏生得出兒子來呢？如時許可，當可在國大以前究成。問·憲草是否必須經立法院通過？答。五五憲草，係經立法院通過者，此次修正案自亦應經過立法院完成立法程序，惟目前起草審議會尙未舉行，修正案尙未擬討完竣，而憲法審議會會召開，尙有待於停戰令之頒發，各項會議舉行後，始能舉行。問。外傳孫院長將兼長行政院，有此說吾？答，並無其事。</p>

<h3>黨政革新會</h3>

<h3>共黨發言人　談目前戰局</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕據共產黨代表團發言人梅益，廿六日晚發表談話稱：目下我解放區全體軍民，正在八處與國軍進行自衛血戰：（一）安東戰塲，國軍三路進兵，勢在必得，安東州被其侵佔有此可能，但未得東北前綫及延安方面證實之前，本人對此事可能引起之後果，暫不加評論。（二）烟台戰塲，廿三日起，政府海軍與由萊陽北犯之陸軍，配合進犯，證明美國要求該處外僑自十六日及廿九日撤退一事與此有關，估計月底將發生嚴重後果。（三）蘇北戰塲，東台已激戰近月，北面則在述陽，漣水一帶激戰中。（四）平漢戰塲，國軍冀圖打通平漢戰綫，北起北平與南至安陽，現雙方主力正在石家莊至良鄕一綫激戰。此外，豫北，同蒲（南段），平綏，　海（魯西南）四處戰塲，亦均在血戰中。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕北平共產黨發言人，今發表書面談話稱：再度提出「政府必須履行一月十日之停戰協完及政協決議案，才有眞正和平可言」。該發言人並指摘國軍進攻南滿之安東通化，山東之烟台，蘇北之漣水，而認此爲和平之烟幕。按日前此間某報曾刋出一「延安和平空氣濃厚」消息，而遭此間共產黨發言人之不滿，今又有某報謂「北平共產黨發言人稱：和平空氣雖甚濃厚，和平談判必無結局」，此書面談話，乃針對以上二消息而發。</p>

<h3>全國商聯會遼寗代表談東北工商業近况</h3>
<p>接收工作太遲巨廠未能開工　將來外貨湧到前途危機可慮</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕來京參加全國商聯會之遼寗代表李藻芳，二十六日語記者：欲求中國富强，除建設新東北外，別無他途。東北若興，則新中國之建立可指日而待，蓋東北物資豐富，近年來工商業已有一基礎，我人所化代價誠大，但東北將來誠大有可爲。據稱：此次出席商聯會之東北代表，共二十一人，代表五個省份；過去十四年中，東北因受敵僞壓迫，對祖國一切殊見隔膜，對政府經濟政策及措施，與國內工商業情况，亦不甚熟悉，擬乘此時間，一方面與全國工商領袖多一接觸，並擬謁部會首長請示，並一訴東北同胞苦衷，會後並準備至滬一行，藉對經濟首府多一認識。</p>
<p>李氏繼談東北工商近况稱：敵冦投降後，在東北留有極佳之工商基礎，對地方與國家而言，皆爲莫大幸事，東北同胞對東北未來工商業，亦抱極大希望，不謂勝利後，突發生種種不幸情事，致全境瘡痍滿目，百廢待舉，同時接收工作亦嫌過遲，致巨廠大部未能開工，長此以往，將來外貨湧到時，東北工業欲再建設，恐不可能，此實爲東北同胞最感焦慮，並盼政府儘速辦理者。談及東北工商業所感受之困難時，李氏稱，我人目前最感困難者爲交通不便，物資不能暢其流，致原料無法運來，成品又無法輸出，工商乃陷於麻痺狀態；例如瀋陽目前米價每斤爲二十七元，而吉林每斤僅四五元，由於交通不便，乃不能運吉林之米以濟瀋陽。另一困難爲動力不足，電力受人破壞，煤斤亦無法運來，瀋陽工廠開工者百不得一。此外，妨碍東北工商業發展者，爲幣制問題，由於流通券發生弊端，幣値日跌，物價日高，例如大米本年二月每斤僅售三元五角，而至今日則已售至八十元一斤，高漲數十倍，紅票一部份已收回，僞造者亦間有發生。目前東北物資輸出，以以大豆爲主，關內輸入者則以棉紗爲多。李氏末謂：東北並不缺乏技術工人，反因工廠未能開工而使工人失業者甚多，東北極需要資金，希望此問題能得各方之協助。</p>

<h3>美蘇關係的癥結</h3>
<p>據合衆社珍珠港廿四日電訊：美國太平洋艦隊副司令麥考密克海軍中將，刻在週遊太平洋及中國各地，視察軍事基地，前天在珍珠港向報界談稱：『美國在太平洋上必須保持堅强的基地綱，以防禦原十彈及其他新式戰具；美國最佳之防務，乃在將　自西方之任何未來敵人，擯諸於千里之外。如此即可使「珍珠港事件」，將來不致重演」。從這一段簡短的談話裏，可以看出美國在太平洋上的戒備，始終不懈。美國採取此種政策的目標，雖然旨在維特和平與安全；但是給世人的印像，終是一種備戰的姿態。尤其在感覺敏銳的國家看來，更是一種嚴重的威脅。</p>
<p>這幾天來，因爲聯合國大會在紐約開幕，五十一國的代表雲集成功湖畔，大家對於聯合國大會的成功，都抱着極大的期望，杜魯門總統固已正式表示，美國決以全部資源作爲聯合國機構的後盾；蘇聯外長莫洛托夫也曾表示，蘇聯對於聯合國大會必有所貢獻，俾使其完成任務；同時並暗示美蘇兩國如出以眞誠與善意，必能獲得互相諒解一切困難均能迎刃而解。論理美蘇關係可望好轉，兩國間所有一切陰霾，都不難一掃而去，但在聯合國大會一方面有若干國家要求撤鈉否決權，另一方面則有蘇聯要求大會秘書處將議程中與討論撤銷否決權有關之案件，一筆勾銷。雙方各趨極端，甚至有古巴代表以去就力爭，蘇聯也不甘示弱，幾乎陷於僵局。使聯合國大會開慕不久，即遭遇到一重難關。這也足以說明，要求美蘇釋嫌修好，通力合作，共同擁護聯合國機構以維持世界和平，並不是一件輕而易舉的事情。</p>
<p>上述兩條新聞的報道，一是美國欲在太平洋上保持堅强的軍事基地；另是蘇聯決不肯放棄否決權。在表面上雖是兩件風馬牛不相及的事情，但按之實際，却有非常密切的關係。試問美國爲什麽要在太平洋保特基地？再問蘇聯爲什麽要濫用否決權？很明顯的，乃在美蘇兩國的互相猜忌，互柑防範，而不肯互信互忍，在合作中求和平，在和平中求安全。不管美蘇兩國的政治外交家在口頭說得如何漂亮，鼓吹美蘇合作；但是雙方各有千秋，但求木身的安全；不顧別人的死活。例如美國爲了自身的安全，要在太平洋及其各處保持堅强的基地，而不問蘇聯是否感受威脅；同樣蘇聯爲了本身的安全，預防他人圍攻計，也要擴充其安全地帶，而將美國的感覺如何置之不顧。但是我們進一步要問：美蘇爲什麽要這樣？美蘇兩國的政治外交家，不乏目光遠大之士，當然也明瞭，美蘇合作，不僅是世界之福，而且對於雙方本身均屬有利；反之，美蘇分離，各奔前稅，不僅是人類的浩刧，而且也是兩國的災難。明知故犯，這又怎樣解釋呢？</p>
<p>關於這些不可理解的啞謎，最近也曾引起美蘇兩國的筆職。首先是蘇聯的「新時代」雜誌，撰文攻擊美國的內政外交，對於美國在世界各處尋覓基地，表示極大的懷疑。蘇聯政論家截芹以懷疑的口吻發問：『自究全擊潰德日兩國以來，美國爲什麽還要這樣瘋狂地在全世界的各個角落裏尋覓基地呢？這是爲了反對誰而需要這麽許多基地呢？」美國讀者潘今斯立即去函，以美國人民的立塲予以答覆，他說：「你們蘇聯，豈不是也像我們美國一樣，在那裏擴充邊界，使其週圍的鄰國成爲「友邦」嗎？美國政府在預防第三次大戰，正如法國在第一次大戰後立即開始建築馬奇諾防綫一樣。所以美國政府也像蘇聯政府一樣，不相信單靠親善與道義之類的無形原則，就可以保陣和平的」。戴芹看了美國讀者的答覆，仍不服氣，又撰述一文在「新時代」發表，再加以辯護：他說關於外交方面的幾個問題，都有極密切的關係。自大戰結束以來，英美兩國的反動勢力，日益擴大了，他們不願與蘇聯及其他民主國家合作，而只企岡使之就範。他們蓄意組織英美集團，向全世界擴張其勢力。甚至美人大言不　地說，第二次大戰後，類已進入「美國世紀」了。』</p>
<p>這一塲筆戰，公說公有理，婆說婆有理，各能自圓其說，我們看了，只覺得墮入五里霧中，對於美蘇間的基本矛盾，更加莫名其妙。但是一般地說來，可從兩方面去觀察：一是思想的衝突，另是利害的衝突。在思想上，蘇聯是社會主義的蘇維埃國家，美國是資本主義的民卞國家，雖然都自稱爲民主國家，但爲兩種截然不同的民主。在蘇聯方面看來，唯有蘇維埃制度，才是眞正的民主，例如蘇聯外長草洛托夫曾在巴黎和會發表演說，公然攻擊英美式的民主，是十九世紀的民主，而自稱蘇聯的民主，才是二十世紀的民主。此在英美方面，對於現行蘇維埃制度，終屬於全能國家的政制，而不是眞正的民主。美國遠東問題專家裴斐敎授，來華講學，曾率直批評蘇聯的民主政治稱：「蘇聯的經濟辦法，是可取的；假如她再給人民以投票的自由，那末我也願意加入共產黨了。』這兩種民主的鬥爭，也就是美蘇的思想衝突。惟在目前的國際上，現實主義風靡一時，思想上的衝突，未必能妨害國際間的合作。在第二次大戰爆發的前夕，誓不兩立的納粹德國與蘇聯，也會化敵爲友，簽訂什麽互不侵犯條約。國際間的悲歡離合，都和思想無關，而其眞正的關鍵還是在利害上。所以裴斐敎授也說：「思想不是愛大的關係，主要的還是國際利害關係。所以常常葬僵。」</p>
<p>以目前的情形論，蘇聯的最高利益，是和平與安全；美國最高的利益，也是和平與安全；只是兩國所要求的和平與安全，各不相同而已。在蘇聯言，經過這次大戰的浩刧，已獲得血的敎訓，目前最需要的是和平，要在和平的空氣中建設社會主義的國家；其次還需要安全，要不愁遭受他國的圍攻。但若非蘇聯出而領導的世界和平，決非眞正可靠的永久的和平；又如果在蘇聯的四週沒有一層廣大的安全地帶，則蘇聯決不能高枕無憂，這是蘇聯的利害觀點。此在美國方面，爲了世界的和平，不惜作重大的犧牲，毅然決然而參加這次大戰。經過三四年的苦鬥，終算能獲得饅後勝利，但是痛定思痛，今後美國唯一的目標，端在維持世界和平，以免戰禍的再起。但是對蘇聯勢力的日漲夜大，不論對於歐陸或對於遠東，終覺得是一種嚴重的威脅，不得不未雨綢繆，而作防患於未燃之計。美國雖然極願與蘇聯合作，但是對於她的强大，終不能不有所戒心。美國爲什麽不肯公開原子能的秘密，而一定要蘇聯先宣佈其在政治上經濟上對於世界的要求呢？這完全出於美國的不能放心，而對於蘇聯有所疑懼，因此互爲因果，乃造成美蘇間的緊張局勢，有增無减。美國國務卿貝爾納斯雖說，美國人民巳向蘇聯伸出友誼之手，但是蘇聯仍有疑懼，還不敢伸出手來，因此美蘇關係，至今還沒有好轉。這也就是美蘇關係的癥結所在。</p>
<p>要而言之，今日世界的重心，完全在美蘇關係上，人類翹首企求和平，並迫切期待着美蘇關係的好轉，已如大旱之望　霓了；負有歷史任務的兩國的政治外交家，應從美蘇關係的　結所在之處落眼，再運用其大知大勇的才能，在美蘇兩國之間，化戾氣爲祥和，至少須恢復到戰時通力合作的精神，共同締造世界和平。這次聯合國大會，正是一個絕好的機會，作爲美蘇關保好轉的起點，我們希望美蘇　國曁其他各國，都能珍重這個可寳貴的機會，在此　間，但　少聞不合時宜的言論，以免再刺激對方的感情。</p>

<p>天拓大上海的問題</p>
<p>鄙人前曾二次就有關郊區交通事投函中——貴欄，並請轉有關市政當局。蒙貴刋披露，並加函覆，不勝感激之至。今閱報知市公用局對於郊區（特別江灣前市中心區一帶）交通之發展，已有具體之計劃，並將付諸實施，不勝欣喜。按市中心區交通之緊要，實不下於市區，因就目前市區，在人口，居民，住屋及交通各方面之情形覜之，實覺大上海範圍之狹窄，非另向郊區開拓，使市區擴展，則不足以躋於世界都市之林。即就目前許多市政困難言，亦非如此不能解決。然欲就市區之　展，則非先發展公共交通，引居民絡續前往，以漸課繁榮不可。今就目前郊區中首先可作爲市區之擴展地者，以市中心區爲最宜。因該地實不可目爲郊區，該爲新上海之核心，戰前吳前市長鐵城，曾有計劃地建設該區，以爲市政中心，已有相當成績，可索前租界區抗衡矣。今雖租界已收回，然其中如道路系統，碼頭等等設施，皆不能合乎現代化都市之標準，故除該區外，須另建新型，現代化之大上海，以適合時代之需要。由上之事實觀之，市中心區之復興，實刻不容緩，市政當局亦早有見於此，故其首步計劃爲公共汽車錢之設置，以便利與目前市區之交通，並爲大上海建設之先決條件。今市公用局旣已有此決定，即恢復市中心區之公共汽車，惟以車輛裝配問題，其實現之期須待下月初旬，惟願市公用局長不作畫餅，以充市民燃眉之　。並請——貴欄站在人民立塲，隨時督促以期早日實現。鄙人覺有數端，應請市公用局注意並負責答覆：（一）將來通市中心區之車輛，其路綫將若何？是否與前華商公共汽車公司所行駛者同？（二）可否即將籌備中之七路公共汽車展長路綫，先行通車，以减短籌備之時期？（三）如第二點不可能，最早該區之交通，何時可切實恢復？其將爲第幾號路綫，其起訖點將若何？均宜及早公布也。（偉哲生）</p>
<p>請郵局加强投遞</p>
<p>滬上郵政，自勝利光復以來，業務蒸蒸日上，據業中人云：郵件擁至，數量已超出戰前，以上海人口麕集，亦較戰前增多，無怪各地通訊者日繁，在通訊者無不希求寄郵投遞迅速爲樂，負投遞責任之郵政當局，自常代盡可能範圍，達愈速愈妙之效率。但揆諸近來郵件往返，大不如戰前之迅速稱意，復據業中人言：近來郵件固多，投遞延遲原因，不外各處交通尙未恢復，且辦理郵務之員工少於戰前，效率銳减，乃不得已事。竊以爲增加郵務員工，屬可能範圍之事，常局因何不使郵件投遞效率加強？又何不加添人員，兼可救濟失業？至於郵政經濟上之得失，應視爲另一事，國家公營機關，原爲民衆服務便利而設也。（陳信）</p>

<h3>五强否決權問題　決列入聯大議程　我首席代表顧維鈞陳述理由三項　蘇聯卒自動撤回其要求</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿五日電〕聯合國大會綜合委員會，今日以美蘇兩國代表態度均甚遷就，已決定將棘手之否決權問題，提付大會公開討論。此一問題，蘇聯原曾要求不列入議程，致有引起該國再與西方列强發生衝突之慮。蘇外次維辛斯基今日突然聲　撤消原案，局勢因吿化險爲夷。美代表奧斯汀原曾領導反對蘇聯要求，並曾提議將否決權問題立即提付大會討論，旋因蘇聯讓步而聲明將自身提案亦予以撤消。美蘇爭執旣經解決，否決權問題乃由主席斯巴克裁決，照常列人大會議程，然後由大會提交政治委會討論。奧斯汀並宣稱，蘇聯此種妥協能度，足證此世界機構必能成功。火會綜合委員會係十四國組成，蘇聯當初正式提議，不應將否決權問題列入大會議程，據維辛斯基稱，聯合國憲章否決權之規定如有變更，將爲聯合國機構一大打擊。英美即出而反對，其反對理由並非謂聯合國憲章所規定之否決權應予以變更，實爲大會不應剝奪討論此問題之權利。領導反對者爲英代表蕭克魯斯，古巴及澳洲繼之提議，否決權問題應提出討論，以便決定應否加以限制或廢止。先後發言反對蘇聯提案者有六國代表，中國亦在內。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿五日專電〕我首席代表兼大會副主席顧維鈞，在綜合委會中會力陳保持棘手之否決權問題於議程中之理由，堪以代表大會之一般情形。渠稱，中國代表團甚爲重祖聯合國憲章第廿七條關於安理會表決程序之規定。　氏提出贊成保特澳古兩國提案於大會議程中之三項理由如次：（一）兩國提案實符合憲章精神，（二）提案置入臨時議程，實符合程序規則，（三）否決權全部問題旣已引起全世界之極大關切與焦慮，聯合國大會對問題之開誠佈公討論，將在公共輿論方面收「有益之效果」。顧氏吿指導委負會謂，中國雖身爲獲有應用此否決權之國家，但向未運用此項權力，蓋中國政府相信全體一致通過之規則，僅用於重要之情勢，故其運用應加以最大之審愼與分別。顧氏末稱，大會對否決權問題之討諭，或可能無具體結果，但至少可得澄淸世界空氣。中國目前始不願贊同召集聯合國全體會議之任何決定，蓋現實無修改全體一致通過原則之任何需要也。顧氏宣稱，中國將在大會中就其對否決權問題之意見，發表較爲詳盡之聲明。</p>
<h3>議程五十三項問題分配於六小組會　聯合國秘書處提出建議</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿五日專電〕聯合國秘書處今向指導委員會提出建議，即將大會臨時議程上五十三項問題，分配於六個主要之小組委員會，秘書處並建議政治安全小組委會應授以若干最易引起爭辯之問題，有（一）各國加人聯合國之請求，（二）理事會之報吿，（三）印度對南非聯邦虐待印度人民之抗議，（四）關於否決權之三項建議，（五）聯合國會員國在非敵國領土內駐留軍隊之問題，（六）起草各國權利義務宣言。其次爲經濟財政小組委會討論者，有（一）聯介國秘書長所提之經濟財政報告，（二）決定解決世界糧荒之行動，（三）聯總之報吿，（四）南非對合併西南非委治她之請求，（五）聯合國會員國對非自治領土之報吿。議程項目之最後分配，將由指導委會決定，然後和以其建議案提交大會通過。</p>
<h3>英代表演說　抨擊濫用否決權　但反對修改憲章</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿五日專電〕英代表諾爾貝克，今日於聯大會發表演說時，頗能盡其雙重之責任。彼以大國首一發言者地位，於答復小國對聯合國缺少成績之批評時，一一叙述聯合國成立以來之成就。此外，並以聯合王國發言人之資格，竭力宣稱，反對任何修改憲章之提議，然亦坦白批評，蘇聯對「否決權漫無節制之述用」。並懇請蘇聯方面之同僚，勿沉緬於此種權利之運用。然渠對大國在安理會之不同意權仍有所辯護，渠建議改進安理會之程序規則，並於安理會之工作上增加新精神。渠竭力維護安理會，並要求大會予以支持。諾氏繼附帶對托管制度，表示信心，並攻擊「好劫掠之帝國主義」。渠表示深信托管制度，將成爲一種動力，以消滅帝國主義之罪惡。</p>
<h3>管制原子能　蘇重申信念</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿六日廣播：今日蘇聯代表葛羅米柯，在聯合國原子委員會重申蘇聯之信念，即管制原子能之工作，可由各國自行負責辦理，正式否認外傳聯合國方面曾對原子能問題舉行秘密談判之消息。昨夜英代表即該國航空大臣諾爾貝克在聯合國大會中完全支持美國所提管制原子能之計劃，聲稱，國際間如對原子　不能成立管制之辦法，結果勢將引起原子能之競爭。貝氏稱，此種競爭目下已在進行中，可能使世界陷入混亂狀態。</p>
<h3>調查國外駐軍　蘇舊事重提　要求列入議程</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿五日電〕今日據接近英國代表團者稱，蘇聯提議調査聯合國在非敵國境內駐軍問題，由聯合國大會討論，英國不致加以反對。按此問題已由安理會拒絕列入議程，蘇聯旋又舊事重提，列入聯合國大會臨時議程。</p>
<h3>印度代表激昂發言　抨擊「帝國主義」　南非歧視印僑應請公斷　並要求理事會中一席位</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿六日電〕印度代表班迪特夫人（即尼赫魯之令妹）本日在聯合國大會席上發表激昂演說，歷三十分鐘，博得熱烈掌聲，班夫人要求聯合國在安理會與經社理事會中界予印度一席位置，其言曰，印度務須擔任一種任務，與其地理位置及其戰時之供獻相稱，環顧目前之世界，强權依然勝過公理，無論在政治經濟與社會方面，均不脫帝國主義色彩。若干國家不惜違反聯合國憲章之原則而逞其所欲，吾人要求從今以後，一切有動凡以武力保衛帝國主義的利益而壓制民族獨立意願者，均應加以禁止，以東印度而論，印度軍隊正被利用與當地國民軍作戰，此種情形亟應制止。南非境內印度少數民族現正遭受虐待，應請大會公斷。至於南非政府要求以西南非委治地併入南非聯邦，印度政府特聲明反對。</p>

<h3>拉丁美洲與阿族國組成集團　增强在聯大會中地位</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿六日電〕共佔聯合國半數以上之拉丁美洲及阿拉伯同盟國家，爲使其在聯合國大會上之政治主張，獲得更强有力之發言地位，聞已分別組成各組集團。阿根廷已於週末召集二一十個拉丁美洲國家會議，討論有關南美之一般問題，實爲上述企圖之第一暗示。拉丁美洲國家會議，將決定安理會中墨西哥之繼承者，及經社理事會中哥倫比亞之繼承者問題。據目前跡象觀察，拉丁美洲各國將支持哥倫比亞參加安理會，而烏拉圭似乎適介於太右傾之阿根廷與太左傾之委內瑞拉之間。至阿拉伯聯邦各國中，聞在安理會中替代埃及者，確將爲叙利亞。又聞阿拉伯各國決定反對在討論託管問題時，將巴勒斯坦之委任統治地，交由聯合國監督之任何建議。</p>

<h3>聯大會中第一難題　否決權的運用</h3>
<p>— （本報資料室）</p>
<p>聯合國大會已於十月二十三日在紐約正式揭幕了，全世界的目光於是又從巴黎移到了紐約。但看了盧森堡宮中和會席上美蘇兩大集團的尖銳對立和爭執紛紜，全世界愛好和平的人士都不免心中懷着一重憂慮，對這次聯合國大會可能的成就，不敢存着過分的奢望。不過，畢竟全世界的國家都在希望和平，安定，我們對於國際問的錯綜局勢，也不必過抱悲觀。在這次的大會中，我們今日已可看出若千難題。如果這對立的兩大集國能够珍重那得來不易的和平，而互忍互讓，在這些問題上求取一種合理適中的解決，那末大會的成功當可預卜。道些難題，如大國否決權問題，領土託管問題，歐洲難民救濟問題等等，在這次的大會中，定將展開一塲激辯。這裏，我們且把這些問題的源流，背景，和目前的情勢一一分析介紹，當亦可帮助讀者了解橫在世界和平之流灘底的，是怎樣的一些暗瞧？</p>
<p>現在我們先就第一難題「否決權」漫談一下。大國之有否決權，本也是强權政治下的遺留品。一九四四年間，美，英，蘇，中，四國在美國鄧巴敦橡園集會，第一次商討未來世界和平機構的組織時，蘇聯就曾竭力主張强國在將來的國際組織中必須另有特權。因此，在鄧巴敦橡園和平方案中，關於世界組織的投票方式問題。就未作任何決定。到一九四五年二月雅爾達會議時，羅·邱，史，三巨頭才商定了未來世界組織中安全理事會投票方法的原則，這就是後來的所謂「雅爾達投票方式。」此一方式經舊金山會議通過，而被採用於聯合國憲章第五章第廿七條中，全文如下：</p>
<p>「（一）安全理事會每一理事國應有一投票權；（二）安理會關於程序事項之決議，應以七理事國之可決票表決之；（三）安理會對其他一切事項之決議，應以七理事國之可決票，包括全體常任理事國之同意票表決之。但對第六章第三十二條第三項內各事項之決議，爭論當事國不得參加。」</p>
<p>這第三點十分重要，因爲那就是包括着所謂大國否決權的。我們知道，聯合國機松最重要的使命是希望能排難解紛，化干戈爲玉帛，使國際間的爭端衝突，大家都到桌子上來和平解決，而不要到戰塲上去刀兵相見。担負這沉重而神聖的使命的，不是聯合國大會全體會員，而是安理會。所以安理會是聯合國機構事實上指導和執行的核心。安理會係由十一個國家所組成，其間美，英，蘇，法，中，五强爲常任理事國，其餘六國則屬非常任理事國，由大會推選。在討論所謂「程序事項」的時候，十一國是完全平等的，祇要有七國贊同，（就是三分之一以上，）議案就可以通過成立。但在討論到程序以外的其他一切事項（即所謂「童質事項」）時，十一理事國的地位就並不平等了，每一實質事項的通過，非但須有七票以上的多數贊同，而且七票中還必須包括五常任理事票在內。換句話說，美，英，蘇，法，中，五强各有着如此大的權力，十一票中，即使有十票都贊成了，他一個人投票不贊成，議案就吿推翻。這就是所謂「否決權」。</p>
<p>問題就在這裏。第一：所謂「程序事項」和「實質事項」究竟是怎麼一個嚴格分法？事實上，屬於國際間爭執的較大事項當然是實質事項，都可以運用否決權。第二：雖然否決權的運用也有着一點點限制，即憲章第六章及憲章第三十二條第三項中規定的「當安理會設法進行國際爭端之和平解決時，則爭端之常事國家，即使是常任理事會，亦不得參加投票，」然這一條文的解釋，也成了大問題，聚訟紛紜，有人主張這個限制只在「爭端」發生時方才適用，而對於可能引起國際磨擦或惹起爭端的任何「情勢」，則並不適用。此地問題又來了：「爭端」和「情勢」究竟應該如何嚴格劃分呢？國際間的問題常常十分複雜微妙，不容易如此機械地區別的。</p>
<p>憲章中當初之規定這種否決權，原也有其不得已的苦衷。因爲安理會調停爭端，萬一不成，還可有權力對破壞和平的當事國實施經濟交通的封鎖，斷絕國交，甚至動用武力。凡此種種，若無常任理事國的五强意見相同，步驟一致，事實上就極難實行，而且甚或將引起相反的結果。世界上的國家雖說應該是無分大小，大家都平等；但事實上，五强的地位畢竟是要緊得多，而爲了使他們能覓取相互間的同意，不致鬧到自己翻臉，所以有否決權之設立，好便事情不致完全弄僵，其法不可謂不善，用心更不可謂不苦。</p>
<p>可是，此爲積極目標而設置的辦法，却成了消極抵制的工具，巴黎和會中，就因爲蘇聯代表的一再運用否決權，使許多問題根本無法討論下去，否決權廣泛使用的結果，更將使聯合國機構和安理會徒託空名，無一事可做。各國都深切感覺到這種痛苦，尤其是各小國，正紛紛醞釀要在這次大會中提出取消否決權。至於各大强國的立塲，杜魯門總統在大會開幕日的演講中，已明白表示贊成就否決權問題作充分討論，甚至作適當的修改。英國方面，首相艾德禮和前首相邱吉爾亦演說主張否決權的使用應有限制，以符世界的民主潮流。但蘇聯方面則正採取堅決步驟，强烈支持否決權，與反對者相搏鬥。蘇聯的採取道立塲，原也有其不得已的苦衷，因爲蘇聯的集團，無論在五十一國的大會中，或十一國的安理會中，都是屈居少數，所以如果眞是一切問題皆以民主方式的「多數通過」來投票，那末蘇聯集團勢將萬事都無插嘴的餘地。因此，要取消否決權，這是絕不可能的，而且恐怕亦非美英之望。惟一的辦法，似乎在對它的運用作適當的解釋和補充，這個難題現已決定列入議程。我們定可看見一場精采激烈的舌戰。</p>

<p>記者爲此事曾訪財政局谷局長春帆，據谷局長吿稱：娛樂稅增至百分之五十乃市參議會大會所決定，財政局無權更改大會決議案，但該會財政委員會議決交財局斟酌辦理，財局自當尊重意見，然如何徴收而能解決電影戲劇業之要求，同業亦能使參議會大會通過，則尙須與參議負共同討商合理辦法。</p>

<h3>應最高當局邀請　魯斯滬滬　吳市長設宴款待　美總領事作陪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕以美國當代大出版家號稱於世之「時代」，「生活」，「幸福」雜誌發行人魯斯（見圖），於昨晚七時乘美軍專機，自美經關島抵滬。前往江灣機塲迎迓者，計有吳市長，宋院長代表，中宜部美籍顧問畢爾，宣傳部長彭學沛代表曾漢光，宣傳部國際宣傳處駐滬代表魏景蒙，市府交際科長張彼德，美國總領事台維斯，美國新聞處主任卡德惠，「時代」雜誌駐華代表格雷等。魯氏此次來華，係應我最高當局之邀請，在滬稍作逗留後，即將於今日午後或明晨晋京。據本市「時代」雜誌辦事處負責人談：魯氏在華將作十餘日之逗留，並將藉此機會，赴各地視察。昨晚與魯氏同來者尙有「時代」雜誌副總編輯亞力山大，及該雜誌駐華盛頓特派員艾爾遜。吳市長昨晚特在官邸設宴款待魯氏及「時代」雜誌在滬同人。美總領事台維斯亦被邀作陪。按魯氏在美出版界中素有「中國之友」之譽。渠早年生長中國，對我國各方情形，深具懇切之瞭解。魯氏曾於去年九月間來華，至重慶，成都，南京，上海，北平各地考察，返美後曾撰文刋載「生活」雜誌，深得美國人士之好評。</p>
<h3>八十二歲老博士卜舫濟由美返華　他說：這兒是我的家，我要永遠住在這兒，直到老死！</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕劈，劈，拍，拍！一陣爆竹的聲音，在聖約翰大學的校門口響起，這是獵迎八十二高齡的卜舫濟博士。敎授，學生，校工，自各個不同方向蜂湧而來，爭迎老校長的歸來！，二輛汽車，載着卜博士夫婦，和那些歡迎的人們，駛過聖約翰的大草坪，在二十四號小洋房的門口停下了。</p>
<p>這是一座半新半傷的小洋房，二層樓是臥室，底層有客廳，書房，飯間，和橱房。就在這所精緻的住宅中，卜博士度過了五十來個寒暑。一九四一年——蘆溝橋發生事變的第四個年頭，卜博士赴故鄕——美國，原意希望在六個月內回中國的，不料太平洋戰事的爆發，把一切預定計劃都消毁了。卜博士只能暫時長駐故鄉，雖然，這位中國之友，無時無刻不在惦記着他的第二故鄕！</p>
<p>中國太太早年去世</p>
<p>在卜博士離開的五年中，這所小洋房是一位林太太代他照顧的。林太太是卜博士、的內姪女——他的中國太太的姪女兒。卜博士曾結婚兩次，第一位太太，是中國人，後來不幸早年去世。現在這位太太，是英國人，與卜博士同歲。他們差不多是同時來中國的，博士來中國已達六十年，太太達五十九年。那時候，卜太太一直在聖瑪利亞女中執敎，卜博士則任聖約翰校長，由於興趣的相問，環境的需要，他們同居了；雖然當時大家都已是五十餘歲的人了。</p>
<p>三子一女各有職業</p>
<p>卜博士有三個兒子，一個女兒，都是中國太太生的。大兒子就是詹姆士敎授，現在聖約翰執敎，並替卜博士生下了一個孫兒，今年已經十一歲了，在貝當路美國學校念書。此外，二個小兒子和一個女兒，都在美國。二兒子在做校長，小兒子是醫生，女兒則爲敎師。現在的這位英國太太，前夫姓枯柏，曾遺有女兒一人，今年也已四十餘歲了。枯柏小姐和詹姆士敎授，戰時始終沒有離開上海，太平洋戰事發生後，即被拘禁集中營，由揚州而浦東，轉輾遷徙，受苦良多，勝利後，大家才得在美國團聚。詹姆士敎授，因念華心切，在兩個月前已回到聖約翰。而枯柏小姐，則與卜博士夫婦同時於前日抵華。</p>
<p>淪陷時期老家無恙</p>
<p>爲了枯柏小姐的緣故，這宅古舊的洋房，險險兒遭受洗刦當枯柏小姐被關禁集中營後，日憲兵便光顧這所住宅，說要把房子貼封條，並且要把傢俱搬走——幸虧林太太一口咬定了這房子是屬於她的，說枯柏小姐不過是個借住的客人。但是日憲兵說：「客人也該有自己的東西呀！」就這樣，他們兇狠地把一隻梳粧台，衣橱，櫈子拿走了。所幸運的，是那些整套的傢俱和名貴的古董都還無恙！</p>
<p>如今，卜博士夫婦又回到了他們的老家，這古舊的洋房，半新的傢俱，牆上點綴着的國畫古瓷，書架上擱着的洋裝書籍……一一切都還是五年前的老樣子，那麽親切和有味，於是，卜博士笑了，臉上揚起更多的皺紋。</p>
<p>他踏進書房，坐在安樂椅上，高傲地對記者說：「我會講上海話，很好的上海話，我還寫過一本書，吿訴外國人怎樣學上海話。我還讀中國報紙，尤其是申報，即在美國，還是常常讀着申報的！」</p>
<p>沈嗣良案　不加批評</p>
<p>談到對於聖約翰大學，他說：變了。怎麽可以有這麼許多學生。」「不過」，他又接着說：「這是戰後畸形的發展，深信不久即將上正軌的。」</p>
<p>卜博士談話的情緒，始終是異常愉快的，但是當記者問得及對前校長沈嗣良的意見時，他的臉突然沉下了，默然片刻，慢吞吞地說：「我不大願意發表關於這件事情的意見，因爲對於這件事情，我不十分淸楚。自然，這是太不幸了，我很憂傷」。問他是不是願意作一次探望，他說：「即使願意，也是辦不到的，因爲這是不許可的呀」！</p>
<p>久住中國不再返美</p>
<p>「你這次來中國後，準備躭多久呢」？卜博士聽到了這句話，似乎不相信自己的耳朶，馬上說：「Parden」！當記者再重複一遍後，他似乎覺得記者問這句話是多餘的。他認眞地說：「這兒是我的家，我要永遠住在這兒，直到老死」！</p>
<p>問他是不是將再任校長，他說：「不任了：已經太老了」</p>
<p>「不：你還很年靑」！記者回答，的確，卜博士的一舉一動，沒有一點像是一個八十二歲的老人，他還年靑，他還要爲敎育繼續的努力！</p>
<h3>上海扒窃党的黑幕（七）</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>以上各種「戳頭戲」的演出，因爲每日老調重彈，自知是違警的勾當。所以每一小組，除了表演的主角之外，還分派各種職務，以爲協助。</p>
<p>（甲）「媒子」——這是同夥化裝路人，爲引人入局的媒介，故必須衣冠整齊，口齒伶俐。一下注便須一再贏錢，而且得到迅速的賠款，使貪小的市民，見獵心喜，下注受騙。</p>
<p>（乙）「把風」——這像行軍的步哨一樣，預防警捕的突然出襲，故在橋樑架子的前後左右，都須放出步哨。</p>
<p>（丙）「塞扒」——這種同夥，專門携帶賂款在身，一遇當一塲失風被捕時，如有可以行賄的機會，便得行賄，俾可當塲開釋。</p>
<p>「黑心銅鈿大家用」</p>
<p>老弟兄帮的「扒竊黨」，他們旣認定巧取豪奪爲其治生本色。因此帮中弟兄，很講交情，決不重視金錢，見利忘「義」。帮中有句口號云：「黑心銅鈿大家用」，即謂不義之財，大家都應分肥。因此該帮弟兄每次下手之時，在例都可以「分一杯羹」。如果到手的不是現鈔而是贓物，便應在變賣後按額分派。其定例爲下手人獨得十分之四，餘款照勞逸分配，雖然等級有差，但却不得爭多論少。</p>
<p>如果失竊者是公門中人，或是有勢力者的近親遠戚，失竊後偵騎四出，不肯干休，再可以根據失事的時間地點，跟活動路綫，責成帮中「爺叔班子」找出是誰鬧出來的亂子，勢不能不「完璧歸趙」。因此凡是曾經染指分羹的人，都須「嘔扒」；就是退還所得錢物之謂。這是帮中人所認爲「掃興」的事，但爲全帮安全計，勢又不能不忍痛割愛。通常扒手所得的財物，例須保留四天不動，如果並無危險的風聲，方才可以公開分肥。所有扒竊得的贓物，都三錢不値兩錢地賣給一種「黑店」，雖明知受虧，但爲求安全起見，祗好從速脫手求現，因爲這也是根據帮中的信條，——「黑心銅鈿大家用」的原則啊。</p>
<h3>江海關總稅務司白立查氏病逝　今晨安葬萬國公墓　繼任人選尙未確定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市江海關總稅務司白立査，已於二十五日晚八時半，在大西路宏恩醫院逝世。按白氏係英國籍，公元一九一三年，即民國三年，入海關任職，爲人精明幹練，在海關歷任要職。一九四一年，即民國三十年，太平洋戰爭發生，被敵寇禁入集中營，倍嘗艱苦，影響健康甚巨。勝利後，轉道回國，至今年六月閒，經我國當局邀請，復來上海，任總稅務司之職。接事之初，因工作緊張過度，且劫後元氣未復，即因病住宏恩醫院，但始終力疾從公。據江海關負責人語記者，白氏於本月十四日，尙勉力赴海關視事，十五日起，病勢劇變，醫生斷爲心臟病的肺病，卒於前日不治身死，享年五十有三，有兒女各一，其獨生子已於大戰時殉難，夫人方於上星期自英國趕到，隨待在側，遺體已移萬國殯儀館。白氏爲天主敎徒，定今晨在蒲石路二三五號天主敎堂舉行彌撒，十時運往靜安寺路萬國公墓安葬。</p>
<p>白氏逝世後之繼任人選，將仍爲外籍人士或國人，目前尙不得而知，惟聞財政部已加考慮。又白氏病假期間，職務均由常務稅務司劉炳彝代理，故衆信劉氏或有可能。按劉氏於戰時曾任重慶關稅務司，勝利後派赴大連接收大連關，後因局勢特殊，致未成行。</p>

<h3>發還土地舞弊案　地檢處開始偵查　三被吿昨均抗傳不到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市第一屆參議會大會中曾被陶百川等諸議員紛紛質詢之高橋區地政舞弊案，地檢處於昨晨傳訊被害人，開始着手偵査。綠於民國二十九年，本市淪陷期內，有敵人糾織之恒產公司，奉敵軍部之命，强迫徵收浦東高橋區沿江邊之民地，六百九十三畝三分四厘八毫，勝利後，市地政局應該區人民之要求，發還各該業主，並決定每畝收回二萬元。其時有名周頌千者，敵僞時期曾任保長，在當地頗有勢力，竟自稱人民代表，與地政局接洽辦理發還該項土地事宜，趁機向鄉民詐財，發還之土地，地政局原定每畝僅收回二萬元，而周竟浮收八萬元，所有被害業主一百另六人盡受其愚，詐欺共達數千萬元，其事被人檢舉後，地政局即進行澈査，主管科長張繼良，曁科員黃啓人，有勾通凟職貪汚罪嫌，經地局撤職交保，並將此案移地檢處偵査。昨日地檢處初次偵訊，僅到被害鄕民十五人，被吿周頌千，張繼良，黃啓人皆抗傳未到。聞該案內幕複雜，牽涉甚廣，前任地政局長陳石泉於必要時亦有被傳訊問可能云。</p>

<h3>後方工廠復員協會　接用敵偽工廠　前途困難尙多　產權有糾紛機器亦破殘　金融須賴政府支持</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕後方工廠復員協會所購買或租用之廿四工廠，雖經敵產處理局審査通過，但迄今尙未通知該會接收。而自接收至開工，有待克服之困難尙多。首先，此批工廠不少均有產權糾紛。特別在敵僞佔領期內，一切賣買行爲，今日均能用「強賣」爲理由，要求發還原有產業。而「强賣」與自願買賣之間，人證物證均成問題。其决此批工廠，爲敵僞處理局過去拍賣不出者，內部機器，殘破不堪；欲加整理，費時費錢。據有關人士之估計，開工依各廠之性質而異，少者二三月，多者需半年。電力之供應亦爲大問題，需在兩月後本市發電量提高之後，方能解決。又接收此批工廠者，均爲後方之中小廠家，資力有限，經此一載播遷，耗費甚多，將來復工之際，尙需政府予以金融上之支持。</p>

<h3>參觀白蕉書畫展印象　絢爛之後歸於平淡　幽憤之氣溢乎詞表</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕人家說，震間白蕉先生，字好畫好印好；昨天到寗波同鄕會看了他最近一次書畫展覽會後，却覺得白蕉先生別署也好，詩更好。何以故？答曰白蕉先生是至性人，雖欲以狂捐自隱，却處處掩飾不了他的一股熱情。對國事雖不肯多說，然而你看他在聽見敵寇投降時的一種狂喜！而對於孩子們，在「記阿弘，阿益，阿蓮」三首長詩中，更是一往情深，白描詩簡直給他做絕了！</p>
<p>早在民國十六年前後，我就知道有白蕉先生其人，雖然他那時恐怕還不大用「白蕉」這個名字。當時的豪情勝槪，熱血如沸，在這十幾年來，抑制着成爲片片蘭瓣，甚至白蕉也談禪了！絢爛之極，已經漸漸歸於平淡但是幽憤之氣，處處還流露在字裏行間。他還是在譴責着的；在魑魅橫行的時候，他就說「不見法蘭西，老翁死貝當！」可惜他那時還不知道貝當並沒有死。</p>
<p>白蕉畫蘭畫竹，不盡松柏，遂致大中堂也有小品氣息。白蕉用畫蘭畫竹之筆寫字，秀麗之氣逼人。但也惟其不畫松柏，遒勁處竟不免敗筆，對聯中常有字字皆好，唯有一筆差池，令人嗟歎不止。字也帶小品氣息，故方寸行楷最妙，狂草便見氣促。寫蠅頭長題，却眞有晋人氣息了。</p>
<p>白蕉論書法，說趙字似娼妓，董字亦非烈婦，自然頗有道理。然而白蕉的字却也倒底還是幽蘭，而非松柏中國的楨幹之材，實在太少了。</p>
<p>白蕉是硏究袁世凱的專家，當年在「人文」雜誌上連續發表的洪憲史料是非常珍貴的。今人不談袁世凱則已，若談則凡有徵引，莫不皆由此來。近年來不知這位「　王」又作何業？在一條小屛條中，他寫了一段諸葛武侯的信，跋文中說原函本是袁寒雲之物，却用「袁世凱盜國」做起首，寫得堂皇！然而白蕉楹聯，近來漸多忠厚之語，以前常寫的集宋詞　聯也幾乎不可復見了能再「求拙」就更好，能使「拙」不「求」。自至最好。</p>

<p>又第六區棉紡公會，於日前召開會員大會，除決定各紗廠對配紗之分攤額，及擬定第三期配售棉紗簡則六條外，並產生原料·議價·配銷三組委員會。各組委員會名單：計原料委員會，東雲章·榮一心·董春芳·黃首民·劉丕基。議價委員會，王啓宇·吳昆生·蔣迪先·郭棣活·程敬堂·唐星海。配銷委員會吳味經·劉靖基·童潤夫·顧鼎吉·郭瓊·程潤生。</p>
<p>昨日議價委員會特召開會議，議定各支棉紗議價表一份，當函報紡管會核定在案（議價見前）。第六區棉紡公會昨除將該項議價表分送各會員查照外，並另函略稱：查此次配售棉紗，當局抱定達到消滅黑市，抑平紗價目的，各廠務須通力合作，自行檢肅。對於已攤配紗外，所餘紗額，各廠出售時，必嚴守議價，是所企幸。</p>
<p>第第三期民營各廠攤紗者，共計卅六家。係按七月份各廠實開錠數攤派，以紡製廿支紗爲標準。如各廠閒售其他支數，照按照下列比例推算：計十支187.5％，十六支125％，廿支100％，卅二支75％，四十二支60％。查各民營廠應攤總額爲八·〇〇三件，共分兩次配淸。第一次應攤額爲四·〇〇二件，第二次應攤額爲四·〇〇一件。各廠攤紗合計額，以申新九廠之九八〇件居首。次爲申新二廠之四八〇件，再次爲統益紗廠之四四四件。其後爲申新一廠之三七五件，申新六廠之三七三件，永安三廠及四廠，各爲三五七件，新裕二廠之三三〇件，信和紗廠之三〇五件。最少爲合豐·勤豐兩紗廠，各爲卅六件。</p>
<p>第三期配售棉紗簡則</p>
<p>（一）此次配紗總額一萬二千〇四件半國營廠占三分之一，爲四千〇一件半，民營占三分之二，爲八千〇三件（民營各廠攤紗數額，另列攤紗表）。（二）各廠照攤紗表，分兩次配淸，（即十月廿八日星期一與十一月四日星期一。）於每星期一，將各支別各商標棉紗及各紗價格，分別繕製表格，提交公會。（三）各廠計算紗價，應以廿支每件一百七十五萬元爲標準。（四）各廠塡送配紗表格時，應同將各種棉紗掣發預約單，（此項預約單以備客戶憑預約單向廠方繳價調換棧單之用。廿支紗五件一張，廿支以上紗，一件一張。）一齊送交公會。（五）公會將各廠配紗表，於星期一下午，送交「複製公會聯合處」。（複製品六公會合設之聯合處以下，簡稱聯合處。）聯合處即依據分配各會員客戶，將購紗戶名，所購何廠，何支何種棉紗，及其價格造表，限於星期三送交公會，公會憑表換發預約單。（六）聯合處接到各廠預約單，即分發客戶。限於星期四持預約單，並備價款向廠方換取棧單，於十日內將紗出淸。</p>

<h3>生絲標準决定　七十七分列爲D級</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前日有關機關聯席會譏，對收購生絲之等級問題，已有決定。今後出口生絲決依商品檢騐局之標準，以七十七分列爲D級。此項標準，與日本相同，較之美國低一分。但據絲業專家云：商品局檢查之標準相當高，在我國列爲D等者，在國外可能升級，過去不乏此類事件。此項決定，已充分顧到生產者之利益。</p>
<h3>本埠生絲出口　本年値二百四十億</h3>
<p>生絲出口，占我國出口重要地位，茲向有關方面調查統計所得，九月份上海生絲出口，計九二·七八四公斤，價値三·四三五·一四九·〇〇〇元，佔出口總値百分之十四，自一月至九月共計六八五·六四一公斤，價値總計二四·〇五九·五六四·一〇七元。</p>

<h3>機器抵押　實施較困難</h3>
<p>仍汪重原料成品</p>
<p>〔本報訊）自四聯總處發表抵押放款辦法後，大體上已有改巡，但記者自有關方面得悉：抵押品仍以原料成品爲原則。因機器抵押，問題太多；一則機器之性能類別，異常複雜，非專家不能鑒別；二則機器有折舊之問題，所謂折舊，可分兩類：一爲機器因使也所發生之消耗，一爲新武機器發明使用，舊式機器因之被淘汰之謂；此均爲辦理抵押時所應考慮之問題。至於新辦法實施之日期，上海分處尙無所聞。</p>
<p>四聯總處放款小組委員會主任委員　寶樹，已就任行總署長，無暇兼顧，堅請辭職，現總處另派中央銀行業務局長林鳳苞兼任，廿六日之小組會，即由林氏主持。</p>
<h3>紗市細挺粗平　雙股起伏最巨</h3>

<h3>銀根鬆金價秀··外幣亦被帶俏</h3>
<p>烚赤昨繼續趨昂，晨開二二六萬七，開後即自二二六萬五起，漸漸回好，供源雖有而不暢，十時後央行以二二七萬七五之價，配給一〇一條，入後週六關係，人心頗挺，銀根更濫，求過於供，繼續見秀，近午曾漲到二二九萬高價，而後稍定，午刻在二二八萬五光景盤旋，午後逢週六交易少，市價平，結果較前收再好二萬三，銀樓飾金掛廿四萬二，紋銀銀元均無變更，暗拆仍甚鬆動，息價自一角二至一角半不等。</p>
<p>外幣繼金市而同俏，美鈔暗盤自四一五〇元升至四二〇〇元左右，較前日又漲少許，港票受港市申電期鈔復降刺激，稍形向榮，在九〇〇元左右掙扎，結果較前收又升五元，港電升爲九〇〇元至九一〇元，印匯一〇七五元至一〇八五元，英匯一四二五〇元至一四四五〇元，美匯牌價平對做寂。</p>

<p>安陽的歷史氣味太濃厚，甲骨文的出土，使安陽小屯名揭世界。燦爛的商代文化，在出土的古物中逐漸累積成一個强烈的印象，刻劃在我們頭腦中。現在跑到這豫北古城，除開坐火車之外，簡直就不便到四郊走動。商紂的時候，據歷史說是南距朝歌，北據邯鄲沙邱，都是離宮別館，可見當時土木工程的進步。盤庚至紂有二百多年的農業定居，這是中國歷史上初次積聚財富的時代，在安定與財富兩個條件之下，商代文化因此有了驚人的成就。而目前的豫北城市是兵的城市，打仗的城市。自然，古來也是有名的軍事要衝，項羽破釜沈舟以擊趙，由此　師，與秦章邯會盟於　水上的殷　，也即是安陽。但這並不足以　傲，因爲中國歷史上可以無項羽或劉邦，但不可無刻寫甲骨與　靑銅器的人。記者終於忍耐不住，不顧什麼勸告或忠告之類，以中國人的資格，冒着一份相當的危險，到郊外走走，因爲別的中國人都能走，就是　國敎士也可以，我爲什麼就不能？</p>

<h3>民族復興的觸媒　數十年來還是「媒而不觸」</h3>
<p>在安陽一週中，出「遊」四次，每次循着現在稱爲安陽河的洹水。第一次到洹水北岸的袁世覬墳；第二次到剛剛打過仗，而且每晚隨時可以打仗的曲溝　去；再兩次是到小屯（殷　）。如果到安陽後竟不能到小屯，一定遺憾無窮。軍調小組前任美代表柯樂，曾偷偷的獨自去過一次，那時的情況比現在要緊張得多，歸來後遂被善意埋怨，但他是有收穫的，從居民手中買到幾片有字的甲骨，也就十分滿意了。</p>
<p>散在民間的甲骨仍然很多。古　可換錢，中國的士大夫早已發明了，能怪這些居已嗎？有一位本地人竟這樣告訴我，戰前他家裏的甲骨用蔴袋裝着，八年來丟來丟去，現在不知丟到那裏去了。在安陽頗有些自命風雅的士紳，收着甲骨或別的什麼古器，作爲傳家的法寶，深藏不露，槍桿重於一切的時侯，學殖勢必荒蕪，郭沫若氏以爲研究這些古董，實在是民族復興的「觸媒」，我覺得我們的「觸媒」，學者們歷數十年來的探求，確實已有相當的收穫，然而終是媒而不觸，我們的民族還是不得要領。古物在中國社會中被保管與被封鎖着，買賣着，本身的命運即大爲可憐，只要看一看安陽縣的古物保存所，即令人難過。這裏而每一件東西無不充滿灰塵，殷　，殷觚，隨意丟在一個玻璃　內，甲骨只有很小的幾十片，而且都沒有字，只有一片上有「癸甲」兩個字。還有幾片骨器（魚刺）和一個骨簇，在積滿塵灰的櫉裏，那些骨片和陶片，彷彿有重復埋入泥土之勢。另外一間大殿上放滿明代的塑像，石佛，宋代鐵佛以及瓦獸，　磚，漢碑，魏碑，一個雜貨堆。放不下的鐵佛石像便放在院子裏，讓它日晒夜露雨淋。最近自武官村運來的一個殷祭器，（我將專文介紹），供在正中，這保管所遂像一個沒有和尙的三淸殿。抗戰之初，曾有約重兩噸的古物裝箱運到南陽，現在已經運回，據說沒有損失，這些前門牌烟箱子還拋在地上，尙未打開。這是在戰亂之後，敵人在這裏弄了多少東西去，並無調查，糊塗以來，糊塗以去。</p>

<h3>隆隆砲聲中訪袁世凱墳</h3>
<p>十四日這天，到城北五里的地區去，以袁世凱墳爲目標，免得走得過遠。我曾經請敎過當地老百姓，說我如果亂跑，會不會跑到了共軍區去，回答說是可能的，「但你很容易看出來。」這人說：「如果這個村子有碉樓，寨子修得很好，有軍隊守崗，那就是有國軍的地方。八路到村子裏第一件事是拆碉樓，把寨子踩平，也沒守崗的規矩，只派幾個人在路邊或者花田裏蹲着。」</p>
<p>一到郊外，隆隆的砲聲就十分淸晰，從東北方傳來。這皰聲已連續響了十幾個小時，軍方說這是常有的事，老百姓說一禮拜前還　得熱鬧。離城北五里就是洹河，有一條可以並行四輛大東的安陽橋架在上面，沒有鐵道時這原是向北方的孔道。安陽建於元代，稱鯨背橋，已有七百年的歷史，只有在這次抗戰中給它炸斷兩孔，犧牲於已族解放戰爭中。洹河的水是那麼淺，淸澈見底，全視不出這竟是古代大爬蟲游息的地方。橋西北岸便是　虎莊，袁世凱葬於此，據說當年還是「國」葬，碑亭，亭殿，翁仲，石坊，一應俱全，翁仲中有古免服和穿北洋軍制服者，眞是不倫不類。一個　國未成的人仍予「國葬」，也是一件不可思議的事。那碑亭中的石碑上寫道：故大總統袁公世凱之墓，他雖然不是皇帝，却還是總統。建築工程歷時兩年，其　　富麗和　破的村屋　直無從對比起。現在這裏駐了一連兵，琉璃牆上打着槍洞，修着工事，墳的頂上就築着一個碉堡。這對於「國」葬者豈非頗有不敬嗎？眞是現代史的滑稽插曲。</p>
<h3>平地築寨子工程嘆觀止</h3>
<p>直到我到過安陽西效之後，才看到防禦工程的偉大。津浦和京滬路一帶的碉　是決不能望其項背的。簡單說起來，這就是一個城。都是圍着一個一個村子築起來，當地人稱爲「寨子」；有的簡直就在平地上築起。其間蓋上房子，　開水井。而周　則有一道或兩道濠塹不等。再圍以鐵絲網。這些濠塹深達二丈，寬達一丈五尺，挖得極深峭，掉了下去決然爬不起來。有一個方城縱橫各一百公尺，那是最大的一個，完全自平地上築起，人工木料麥　，都自當地徵來，老百姓有多少負担，可想而知。據當地人佔計，「三十億不會少。」這指安陽已築的工事。</p>
<p>這些高達一丈五尺的土城，完全用泥和着切碎的麥桿築起來，每一個村子都有，如果一個村子挨一個村子發展過去，不消一萬個村子就等於築成一條萬里長城。當年萬里長城也不過是土城，而當時徭役之車，已垂著於歷史，今日豫北一隅對於這些工事的負擔，也快成一條萬里長城了。</p>
<p>共軍去了，把物資括光，農民也被動員掉，剩下的是破房子，土地已經被分配過了，得到土地的人被用各種方式要他們去當兵，拿起槍桿來對抗政府，說是保衛自己的土地，保衛「翻身成果」，有些人說：原來分地給我們不是要我們種，不過是要我們當兵打仗吧了。橫直是有苦難訴。農民以爲怎好可以離開土地呢？悄悄地圖來，只看見破房子，連耕其也沒有，只好坐在瓦礫堆上哭泣。只埋怨自己命運不好。現在他必須做徵工修寨子，說是保衛家鄕，一片下過種的地，因爲畜力缺乏，一個小脚女人拖着石捻在壓地，你看這照片上，她簡直把自己當牛一樣的工作着。</p>
<p>在曲溝又西的地區內，已衆簡直不能去收割，槍彈是不認人的。白天不能去，晚上更不能去，因爲接火經常是在晚上。安陽西部平原，這時工是棉花登塲的時候，有些地方部隊要抽百分之六十，說沒有我們你們能收嗎，抽得有理，據說城裏還有專　機關，這眞是一個特殊的地方。這些不能收穫的區域，我站在寨子上望出去，往來不見人，棉花撒滿地上，二里外就是共軍的村落。打好包的棉花自安陽一車一車南運，你們不會看到上面沾着豫北農已的點點血淚。</p>
<p>戰國時，西門豹治　（即今安陽），引漳河水爲渠，以裕農利。唐時開萬金渠，安陽西部賴此灌溉，數千年來，這裏土地肥沃，現在因爲戰爭，共軍把恒河上的渠口堵住，這裏便沒有水了。黃壤不能積蓄水份，沒有水便接近沙漠。這種黃壤也眞好，容易開挖割切，　把工　築得那麼漂亮而結實。</p>

<h3>名聞世界的小村落　小屯初旅</h3>
<p>小屯一帶，大約出於「戰略」關係，却並未築寨子，小屯人自負地說：我們這裏人都有知識，沒有一個人當八路的。十七，十八兩天，我連續去兩次。這一個名聞世界的小村落只有何霍張三姓二十幾戶人家，二百多居民。有不少中年人向我關切地問起董作賓和李濟之先生，他們現在什麼地方。他們很淸楚地記起十八年到二十一年間，中央研究院派董式來幾次發　的情形，一千多工人動手，到晚上還辦有學校，董氏對他們開講過甲骨文，把發掘古物的眞實意義告訴他們。小屯人很明白，甚至有些農民還認得甲骨文字。一位過去的爲發掘團煮飯的農民，介紹我向一個老年人買一件王器，說：「你可以帶回去的，這的確是三代的東西。」他說出了「三代」這個外詞。我另外獲得了一片布紋陶，一片獸頭黑陶，一個骨　，十片甲骨碎片和一個銅斧，他們的目的雖是在換幾個錢，但也欣幸地以爲我是「識」者。他們經常在家裏找出些破片來賣。</p>
<p>董氏爲小屯人辦了一個學校，他們一致惋惜，認爲如果不打仗，這學校辦到現在可好了。據說那學校也敎些甲骨文課，眞辦得够書卷氣了。有些居民對於古物智識是頗驚人的，他懂得開挖的方法，認識泥土的年代。他們說城裏的日本人曾經想來挖，可是不知從何下手，於是被斷定爲「這些人並沒有研究，想發洋財吧了。有研究的會不知道挖嗎？」</p>
<p>這些農民普遍地害着眼病，營養不良，一個少年的眼睛已經瞎掉。兒童們普遍的　　，瘦　，吃着沒有菜的高梁米飯，兩只小手，摔了一大碗黃色的高梁飯，蹲在泥地上吃着。侮一戶負担着徭役；攤派墓料，麩皮，麥子和錢，一個月要幾萬元。拿這幾個錢買些蛋和肉類吃，那少年也許不致瞎眼了。</p>
<p>這個爲發掘團煮過飯的農民　我說：「中央研究院現在該來了吧？」他指着洹河邊的棉花地，說六大龜甲就在那裏發現，連泥一起運走的。我們循着洹河邊走着，他隨處告訴我某一地方出過什麼東西，他成了我的考古學敎授。他們回想到當年三角五分錢一工的生活，彷彿保夢一樣。想到十五年前的生活，看到我這位不速客，於是聯想到中央研究院，說：「中央研究院現在該來了吧？」</p>
<h3>最近出土的祭爐　銅綠斑爛古意盎然</h3>
<p>到安陽後，遇到安陽縣府秘書長談到最近出土的股古器。因爲我已聽說過這件本，到安陽後頗想一考究竟。他告訴我說這是一個爐，上千斤重，而且其中還有一點糾葛，據說「獻」出這件古器的人並非完全爲原物主，他在安陽淪陷期間是漢奸，想借此洗洗澡。但另與此器相關的是抗戰人物，目的倒不在所有權問題，而是由這一個人來出面「獻」，頗爲心有未甘。這位秘書長說我們政府可不管，反正誰「獻」來也好，政府當然只有一個字：收。據說這古器係在廿八年就出土了，東西太大太重，悄悄重又埋起，消息走漏出去，日本人願意出七中萬偽幣收買，沒有達到目的，據說送出了一個小的，總算憑着一股「民族感」保留了下米。但那個小的究是何物則不詳。出土地點是在這河北岸的武官村在安陽西北七里。這地區直到目前還不安定。今年七月，縣府請當地駐軍掩護，渡過洹水去搶運過來。</p>
<p>武官村南岸斜東南二里許就是股壇即今日的小屯。中央研究院在兩地都曾發　過。這件古器的出土地點靠近河　甲陵，（此處　作　曾領導發掘。得器甚多，可詳閱中央研究院報告書，商務版。）運到城裏後，即放在古物保存所。</p>
<p>構造</p>
<p>此器高三尺二寸，尺二寸。　耳，四足。重量不明。四面各版厚約半英寸。銅質。看銅的顏色，銅質相當純。這是一個祭器。甲骨文子作　，子爲正月，因正月主祭祀，子字遂爲祭器的象形。看此器形狀，與甲骨文比較，便一目瞭然。　期甲骨文子字你　，顯然殷祭器圖的方的都有，而這一個是長方形的。</p>
<p>全器可分爲十一個部份，四面，一底，四足，二耳。二耳是焊上去的，一耳已完全脫焊，現尙埋土中。照片上所存一耳，一端脫焊，一端折斷，也已完全與器的本身脫離關係，圖中所示，是攝影時臨時裝上去的。如果取下接焊部份的銅屑，加以化學分析，也許可以知道當時的接焊方法。這脫掉的一耳放上去的時候，竟非常的穩，完全在重心上。</p>
<p>至於器的本身，却看不出有接焊的痕跡；四足是空的，上通器底，俯首器內看，可見此器四角有四個圓洞。耳朶也是空的。</p>
<p>週身銅綠斑爛，古意盎然。硬結的泥土，成顆成片和銅體發生化學作用，堅硬地結住在銅上。用手指剝搖不動。</p>
<p>圖案</p>
<p>耳，足，面，却有浮雕圖案。說它完全刻鐫則不確。大抵在製摸　製時已刻定，而在　出後加以刮削修正。耳的三面有花紋，面的裏面沒有，足的周圍都有，器底則是組粗的隆起兩　　，交成「十」字，器底成「出」字狀。</p>
<p>鐫紋大致可分三層，一層爲底紋，二層爲　　，三層爲浮雕上的鐫紋。有多處經過割削的鋒芒棱角極顯著。</p>
<p>現在假定此器圖案爲　　。底紋基本上是廻　文，　　狀。我看見過廻龍文的陶片，這次我在殷　獲得一片方形廻龍文的陶片，廻得極整齊，可見廻龍文是殷人所習用的圖案。甲骨文「亘」字作　，艱道是洹水出龍的會意嗎？第三層也是廻龍紋，或者是廻龍紋的簡化。</p>
<p>器的四角隆起四條脊，每足亦各隆起一條脊，器面各面上下各隆起一條，是　　的圖案。</p>
<p>每面浮雕有六全龍，四龍首。耳上的兩龍顯然不一樣，其一耳角圓，第三層紋作巨作，綫條硬直，現姑名之爲甲籠，其一耳角尖，第三層紋綫條較柔和，姑名之爲乙龍；兩　合看一人頭。（也是浮雕，）恐怕這是一雌一雄</p>
<p>器面上緣兩全龍但爲甲龍；下緣兩全龍俱爲乙龍，（惟第三層紋基本土俱爲迥龍紋，與甲龍殊），四角四龍首雖俱爲乙龍，但上兩角的龍首各多一隻「角」，此點知甲乙龍不同，姑名之謂丙龍。</p>
<p>如圖上所示，耳下端和器緣接焊，乙龍下有一個龍頭，有角，正是器面上角的丙龍。</p>
<p>至於四足四龍，則供爲乙龍。</p>
<p>我這次在小屯復獲得有小獸頭的黑陶片，拿回來一核對，不覺正是兩龍。</p>
<p>此器一個面左上角浮雕已毀損，如果不是翻製時所毀，便是在一塲大火中燒壞，或者後者可信，因在其附近的耳脚兩龍首，沒有脫焊，祗是折斷了。或是在高熱中竟把接焊處溶實了的　故。另一脚及另一耳的兩脚，却是脫焊的。</p>
<p>釋文</p>
<p>此器有銘文，在器裏面居中處。係甲骨文「后妻戊」三字陰文。鐫刻的鋒　極明顯。深　一　餘。非鐵器　辦，故此器當在股末。或者這竟可以作爲殷有鐵器的佐證。</p>
<p>「后妻戊」三字實際上是兩個字，殷甲骨文人名有併寫的習慣，如報丙，報乙大乙，（湯）之類。如殷人稱謂：父了，兄庚，也常併寫如一單位，這名字是一個整個的槪念，寫成一單位，是極自然的。</p>
<p>這「妻戊」，如援父丁，兄庚例，即這位太太的本名爲「戊」，這時成爲先后，他的丈夫（殷王之一），錢了這個祭器——這個大銅飯碗來祭她，紀念她。現在我不知道「妻戊」是那一位殷王的太太，我只帶了一枝筆跑到安陽來，如果翻翻書查得出，那麼比器確切年代便一算即得。</p>
<p>我的另外一種非非想法是：所謂先后　者，如爲其子孫的稱呼，那麼「妻戊」或有「邁達姆戊」——「戊夫人」「戊太太」之意，「后妻戊」竟可讀爲「后戊妻」，不過究沒有上述的有例可援。湯以後的殷王中有一位叫大戊的，是湯的第四代，大戊是商前期的有作爲者，也許頗得力於賢內助，極爲後輩欽仰誠敬，特地鑄器祭她。不過究屬無稽。</p>
<p>此器風格持重，雖然未脫豪邁粗獷之氣，但是鐫刻工整，必定是農業定居相當久，溶銅工業設備相當有規模的時候，才能　出來，故最早當在盤庚以後。</p>
<p>記者非考古專家，但在處處兵火的今日，覺得此器遭遇亦不平凡。靑銅器雖然不比大砲使人有趣，但我是樂於報導的。</p>
<p>河　甲陵那一帶無疑爲殷廟所在，尤其是到紂的時代，規模大盛，但是他不祭祖先（武王伐紂的理由之一），說不定就是在亡股的大火中一直埋到現在。不是周初的邶，　，衛，已有離離之感了嗎？</p>

<h3>問一聲如何？嘆一聲奈何！　桂林悲訴十月情</h3>
<p>— 十六日桂林航訊本報特約記者梁小中</p>
<p>桂林的秋天是乾燥的代名詞。居住在裏面的人，有點像熱鍋上的螞蟻，走頭無路，偶然一陣秋風起處，黃沙撲面，行人裏足，走在路上，隨時得担心身旁的敗　　的一聲倒下來，此之謂桂林的深秋「風」情。</p>
<p>前幾天，市上東華路一隻剛破殼的雛鷄使振翼而啼，引動了人們一片好奇心，成了街談巷議的資料·再過幾天，人們又會帶着另一顆心情去看「父母官」們的大集會！卅五年省地方行政會議聽聽九十九縣一個市長訴不完的苦。一件小事，一件大事，便是寒城深秋最起勁的故事了。</p>
<p>省當局響應了獻校祝壽運動之外，再獻出兩條路，把桂西路和桂東路改名中正路。爲了中正將，又有人想起了兩年前宏偉塊　的中正橋。而今只剩有四個橋柱的中正橋，因此打算在行政會議　轉念頭。</p>
<p>五瘟使者　捨不得廣西</p>
<p>疾病迅速侵佈了整個桂北，而且攫奪了不少的生命。情况之可怖，不是筆墨下的事情。桂林北迄興安一帶，患此病者不下八萬人，興安上至縣長，下至雜差，整個縣政府都在「打擺子」，公事都弄不了，衙門內　氣冲天。資源的鄕村，一個自然村不到半個月，死掉五百人，（請問廣西的鄕村有多大？）融縣的統計，。桂林的奎寗丸賣到絕市，因爲吃奎寗中毒轉黑水病而死的，亦屢見不鮮。鄕村裏，三斤米換一顆發冷丸，多少農民寗願靜靜地躺在床上病死，也捨不得用他們的汗血去換這些「勞什子」痛苦莫此爲甚。奇怪的是五瘟使者捨不得廣西，衛生署爲甚麼正眼都不瞧一瞧，人給病鬧得慌，二造的田禾也給虫鬧到死。白穗，空穀，枯桿諸多毛病，遍佈着整個桂西南，（尤以南寗一帶爲甚），禾稱正在抽穗，用不得剪苞機，用不得梳虫器，只有眼光光望着收些禾草燒燒，頭造榖　，二造白種，實在不敢想像明年的春天。</p>
<p>鷄蛋過手　一處輕一兩</p>
<p>荒年　收，恐怖交侵的日子，救濟是一條驚風駭浪的帆船底鐵錨，一點也假不得。一虛假，就是千萬條性命，死在「救濟救濟」的聲音下面。年來的救濟工作在廣西的確未曾有所謂成功的表現。其中儘管或者是事與願遠，或者是人謀不臧，總之，死去了無數的人，是事實，想不出甚麼好辦法來，也是事實。救濟分署的黃署長是熱心腸，這是五花八門的救濟品却撞歪了多少工作人員的腦筋！「鷄蛋過手」，一處輕一兩」。到頭來，大抵是「　捲西風，人比黃花肥」。不要說災民給捲個嗚呼哀哉，就是日來分署大發慈悲，分發桂林各機關（如市府報社等）公務員的救濟衣，也莫不有如前淸官吏穿的補子，死人時假的招魂幡，又破又　，簡直把公務員當呌化子看待，從此向下有難民所得的是甚麼，便也應該可以想像了，難道聯總限裏就看見中國人都是呌化子？未必，桂林街頭擺的是救濟品，街尾擺的也是救濟品，而且都是些「中國衣冠」，精美絕倫。</p>
<p>新車出塲　救濟粉壓倉</p>
<p>救濟麵粉一千噸一千噸的在倉裏發霉天天叫救濟品缺乏交通工具，一批批簇新的「CHT」的道奇，却在挂林的廣塲上「要子」，衝來殺去過日子，一受干涉，司機先生便瞪眼大喝：「行政院的事，你配管」，可　陀佛！廣西分署揭　的救濟口號是：「不做工不給飯吃。」大槪此輩賦閑候命者，是吃麵包。</p>
<p>最近行總軫念飢寒的難民，據傳將有大批布料運桂發放之議，數目是棉布十八包，布四六〇包，被單廿六包，中紡布三六九九疋，斜紋布七〇〇包，棉花二五〇包。冬深了，風寒霜降，以前難民領麵粉是一人十兩八兩，我想，布發下來，總不會是一人十寸八寸那末滑稽了。</p>
<p>說救濟，救濟也有一個插曲，苦透了的廣西公務員，請行總一發慈悲，行總的覆文是：「公務員不屬救濟對象」故而「礙難破例予以救濟」。萬一破起例來，公務員的　救濟衣準穿不完。行總有點像財神，窮士遇財神，　常聽到的都是「礙難」「礙難」之類，天公地道。</p>
<p>無車無煤　桂柳何時通</p>
<p>多少日子來報導湘桂黔路的消息，彷彿都不外塡入一個「修復無期」的公式哩，日子一天天延宕下去，百姓苦悶，路局的員工苦悶，記者的筆也苦悶。日前只是短短一段路（自蘇橋至挂林南站）的通車，便激動了無數人的興奮。車子從蘇橋披着陽光，踏上　別兩年的鋼軌，車頭車身，像一匹老牛，每一次的喘氣，都在訴說出不知多少辛酸苦難。車皮和橋梁底材料，都是在草堆和水底下再翻出來，用手工修修鑿鑿，將就將就使用，（修復工程，只能够拿破壞不重的地段來試一試，至於已燬的大橋樑，至今依舊崩垂江心，相伴曉烟踐月凄凉而已）車子進入南站，一聲長鳴，廻盪在車站前的人山人海底心裏，又酸又甜。兩年沉寂，一旦重逢，奔馳着的火龍壯影，誰能不感慨無窮？然而，感慨無窮的下面，還有一個無窮感慨，試車只是一度曇花，行車的時日却仍在　無縹渺間。在目前煤也無，車也無，十一月底桂柳通車的支票，恐怕還有點手續未淸，要「重貼現」。</p>
<p>陸上不通　空中謀恢復</p>
<p>陸上走不通，空中倒走得起勁。西南航空公司籌組恢復，已得中央贊助，允許撥機應用，開關粵台，粵桂兩綫。萬一能早期開航，將來發展，不難期待。目前要解決的，是兩廣合營的航空公司底利潤問題和人事問題。</p>
<p>深秋和寒冬交替的爭節，桂林永遠都是一樣靜寂。季節的轉移，只不過是人們眼里一層平凡的變化。他們的心比七星岩更深沉。興高彩烈的只有貴人們，正忙着要在冬天里把西北郊的一大片空地，建築起一座座的洋房，美其名曰「小東山」，（按：東山爲廣州達官貴人住區）行見珠光寶氣，層樓疊榭，傲視着貧窮的桂林城。</p>

<h3>演出的完整　評「清宮外史」演員</h3>
<p>— 陶熊</p>
<p>一個戲的演出必須完整！爲了演出完整的演員，必須放棄其個人的被喝彩和掌聲！</p>
<p>觀衆演出公司上演的「淸宮外史」平爲一般人士所歡迎。上海的觀衆對它們中的李蓮英一角，頗爲讚許。其原因並不是演李蓮英的演員眞正把這性格演得典型化，而是因爲他演得比別人突出，處處賣弄他自己的演技熟練和聲調的無理由的陰陽怪氣所致。陽華是一個懂得觀衆和知道吸引觀衆的演員。他化裝李蓮英的外型，就給了這角色無限的神氣。但他給這角色內衣的血肉，我不敢認爲合適。自然李蓮英是一個太監，一個永遠不會生鬍鬚的男性人物，動作和說話中，可能有若干女性的味道。然而陽華給我的印象並不是這個，甚至於沒有絲毫女性的感覺。整個的感到只是陰險和說話的怪聲怪氣，除了這些以外就沒有別的。我看「淸宮外史」共計三次，但是沒有一次能够完全聽淸楚李蓮英的談話，他有時的聲音低而快，簡直聽不出他在說什麽，這不能否認：不是我這觀衆的失敗，而是演員的失敗！</p>
<p>很多從內地來的演員，他們過去是在戰區和農村里工作，在演出的時候，和沒有舞台經騐的演員在一起演戲，使他們養成了這種「突出」和「逗觀衆」的習慣。在那個時期和區域里，我們是能原諒的！但是現在，則不能原諒！因爲現在是全國性的，是代表着全國藝術水準最高的演出！所以我們要求的是演出的完整，不是演員個人的彩聲。「淸宮外史」的完整性，顯然地是給陽華破壞了。</p>
<p>寇連材是一個十七歲的小太監，當我讀劇本的時候，我對他很徧愛。我覺得他可愛，天眞和有正義感。但在演出上，我覺得演員嗓音的粔决，和他的一股傻腔，使我感到他像一個僞裝天眞的小老頭兒。</p>
<p>演這角色的是沈揚。他的唯一優點是能够把自己的情感鑽進角色的性格裏去。但是千遍一律地有一股子假裝天眞的傻腔，這也可以說是他唯一的劣點。不過，無論如何比起那般沒有感情，只憑外形技演的演員是强得多了。</p>
<p>演翁同龢的寇嘉弼，是在演出中途頂上張雁的缺，使我們有了一個比較，張雁的翁同龢並不能算不够，只是他對這角色的年齡不够老，因此不像一個文弱的爲王者師的人，却像戰塲上的一員老將。而寇嘉弼却把這一點彌補了。他使他自己的外型，及其動作和聲調，甚至性格，都合適了這文弱而固執的王師同龢了。</p>

<p>聯華自勝利復員後，第一部開拍的電影是史東山編導的「勝利前後」，現改名「八千里路雲和月」，引用岳飛滿江紅中的詞句作爲片名，在內容和意識上更爲妥切，前天會到史東山先生，更獲悉了全片故事，我要說：這將是一部國產片中劃時代的傑作，牠的成就將爲本年度國產片中最光輝燦爛的一頁！</p>
<p>故事是以一對流亡的劇人禮彬（陶金飾）玲玉（白楊飾）在勝利前後所經歷的艱苦旅程作經，再以勝利前後的國家大事，社會情况爲緯，在時間上經歷入一三抗戰初期，京滬路戰事，徐州會戰，湘北大捷，黔桂會戰，以至暴冦投降，再由重慶復員來滬，在區域上幾走遍大半個中國戰區，眞是戴月披霜，看盡八千里路雲和月。最緊要的一點是史先生以深沉的筆觸反映各地各處的社會怪狀，人民慘苦生活，如和平後還鄕的困難，江西諸省的災區實况，暴吏强徴軍糧，災民出賣子女，以及返滬後幾位接收大員的鑽營舞弊，富人們窮奢極慾的享受，美貨充折市面，醫院勒索病人……一對貧苦的藝人飽經滄桑，無限感慨，最後以白楊在醫院中產生第二代新生命作結，在悲哀傷感中寄以無窮熱望。全片情調哀戚，魄力驚人，眞是寫畫十年中　　史實，一册驚心動魄的亂世春秋！</p>
<p>由這個戲使我想起英國名　家Noel　Coward的「征騎的隊伍」（Cavalcads）自甫非之　（一八九九年）經首次世界大戰，至一九三〇年止，包括三十年國家大事。人生變幻，全劇也引用一對羅柏特夫婦作經，再以他們週遭所發生的故事作緯，以「八千里路雲和月」比擬，前者偏向用傷感輕淡的筆觸寫作，後者却更積極地用現實的筆觸大胆地暴露了中國社會的形形色色，在氣氛上後者也許較前者略差一籌，但用之作現實針　，效力又不可算計了。</p>
<p>全片現已攝竣五分之一，據公司當局預計，大致可以在今年聖誕節左右獻映，觀衆可靜心等着這張名片來臨　！</p>
<h3>「人與鼠」的主角</h3>
<p>— 迂</p>
<p>吳永剛編導之「人與鼠」決於十五日開拍，主要演員爲電影皇后胡蝶（演季若蘭）電影皇帝金熖和劉瓊三人。金熖拍完「人與鼠」後，即赴美國參加孫瑜導演之五彩片，與黎莉莉合作演出。</p>
<h3>今日中國的劇作家</h3>
<p>— 納雅</p>
<p>在今日處低潮地位的中國劇壇上，也並沒有產生過一個有力的新進劇作家；即使是那些老的，不惹人注意的也有好幾個。同時也沒有人個別的介紹過，現在，我就把目前諸位所熟悉的幾位劇作者，分別作一介紹與檢討：</p>
<p>曹禺：——提起道個名字，諸位一定會想起他很少的劇作，「雷雨」，「日出」，「原野」，「銳奕」，這些名著的吧！不錯，他是一位在現今劇壇負有聲名的人。談到他的劇作，是很工　的，祇要看他許多年來，祗有這麼幾本作品，就知道他是一位「難產」的作者。</p>
<p>曹禺雖是一個負有盛名的作者，現在已經放洋；可是從他的作品看他的思想，似乎是很落後的「宿命論」者，如「雷雨」，「原野」裏面都有，他往往把一個人物安排到「命運」裏去，如「雷雨」裏四夙對她的母親發誓，說往後就給雷打死；結果，她是去了，而是被雷打死了。像這種類似提倡迷信的詞白，可以說是他唯一的錯誤的。</p>
<p>以後希望他能改正這種落後思想的錯誤，在中國的劇壇上，是有他的前途的。</p>
<p>陳白塵：——「陞官圖」盛演到現在，誰也不會忘記他那名著；在當代，他也是名作家之一。戰前他有成功的作品：「太平天國」史劇，戰後的「魔窟」（新官上任）、也稱力作。</p>
<p>在他的劇本裏，對話編製的技巧，均稱優越；他今年才三十多歲，以後的作品當然也很是多的。目前在他的劇本裏面，免不了有錯誤的觀點，如目前上演的「陞官圖」，「新官上任」等、「陞官圖」裏官老爺似嫌太過火一點，官說什麼就是什麽，他忘記了百姓的權利。</p>
<p>因爲他的年輕，前途也正光芒萬丈。</p>
<p>袁俊：——亦名張駿祥，他的作品：「萬世師表」曾得蔣主席的褒獎，其他似「小城故事」，「鳳凰城」等都是他的得意作品。</p>
<p>他是劇作者兼導演的，我們不是看見上海上演「萬世師表」時，是寫着袁俊編劇，張駿祥導演的麼，由此，我們可以看出他的多能。</p>
<p>「萬世師表」的演出雖失欺，而他的導演是成功的，所以失敗，是劇本題材的關係，與現在這時代似不符合。</p>
<p>他能與他的夫人白楊女士的合作，以後對於劇壇，是會有更多的供獻的。</p>
<p>李健吾：——他在劇作家裏面，並不是成功的一個，這一點是犒戲劇的人都知道，瞞不了人的。他的作品不算少，劇本最多，也有小說與散文，可是指不出那一篇是特別出色的。</p>
<p>他對於文化很有貢獻，是「文藝復興」的編者，對戲劇也很努力，希望他以後能產生幾篇成功的作品。</p>
<h3>中電影訊</h3>
<p>「遙遠的愛」日昨撮拍一景，有新聞記者攝取新聞照片之塲面，需用鏡箱鎂光設備，「中國新聞照片社」慨允借予，由該社攝影記者黃寗民親將其「吃飯傢伙」帶交「中電」二廠使用，並撮取「遙遠的愛」工作照片多幀。</p>
<p>「遙遠的愛」拍「碼頭」一景，爲求像眞起見，導演陳鯉庭特派劇務莊凱廬邀一餛飩担至攝影塲充臨時演員，該廠臨時演員共有三百餘人之多，久候拍戲，無事可做，頻吃餛飩，致於未拍之光，已將全担上之卅斤麵，廿斤餛純皮消耗得一乾二凈，餛純担再度辦貨，仍然生意興隆，老關笑口常開。</p>

<h3>西哈諾的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>讀「西哈諾」</p>
<p>曷斯當的「西哈諾」在一八九七年由演劇家哥格蘭初次演出就得到尊貴的榮譽。哥格蘭是一個能鬥劍，能朗誦詩的演員，但他一直沒有機會演過這一類性格的角色，因此曷斯當替他寫了這一部「西哈諾」。</p>
<p>西哈諾是一個能鬥劍和朗誦詩的全才人物，但他有一個奇醜無比的大鼻子，因此變了他戀愛中的障碍。</p>
<p>「西哈諾」中的三個主要人物：西哈諾，克利斯將和霍克桑。霍克桑是西哈諾的表妹，她是一個美麗的姑娘。西哈諾愛她，因爲自己的大鼻子，所以不敢向他的表妹訴說心中的熱情。克利斯將是一個芙貌的男子，但他胸中空空，是個旣不能鬥劍又不能做詩的蠢才。因他的英貌給霍克桑愛上了。同時也因他的無才，霍克桑很可能地不愛他。我們這位英雄西哈諾不忍霍克桑得到　苦，所以用自己的才能去代替克利斯將爭得這份榮耀的愛情。促使他們兩人的成功，自己則躱在一邊深深地把愛情埋入心底。</p>
<p>克利斯將在戰役中陣亡，霍克桑到尼姑庵里躭了十四年，西哈諾一直就沒有離開過她。當西哈諾被刺臨死的時候，給霍克桑發現了這個秘密。她說：我祇愛了一個人而失掉了兩次！</p>
<p>「西哈諾」這一個充滿了浪漫色彩的劇本，是十九世紀末紮的巨著，這浪漫悲　　很多人以深刻的印　！</p>
<p>西哈諾是戰鬥中的英雄！是詩人中的天才！但他缺少了一點和諧。上帝沒有賜給他一付美麗的面貌，使他成了愛情塲中的悲劇人物。他雖然是情塲中的弱者，不敢大膽向霍克桑一吐衷心，而他却是一個懂得愛情的殉情者。因爲他太愛對方了，他怕說出了心中的愛而遭受對方的祖絕，所以他忍願把愛藏人心底，直到生之最後一刻。</p>
<p>他願意自己躱在黑暗里，和陽台上的霍克桑講情話，却讓克利斯將爬上去接受那榮耀的一吻！</p>
<p>西哈諾的悲哀：在他的一段話里全部可以看出：「我的命運就在人家背後做一個牽線人——即終於被遺忘了！（向霍克桑說）你記得克利斯將在陽台下同你談話的那一晚嗎？那麽，我的命運就是如此的：我躱在下面黑暗里，別人就上去採取那榮耀的一吻，這是分平。我在我的墳前還稱許莫利哀有才，克利斯將有貌呢！」</p>
<h3>一週電影短評</h3>
<p>— 祝西</p>
<p>本週諸片當推「左拉傳」爲最佳，但賣座當以「泰山到紐約」第一。</p>
<p>左拉傳</p>
<p>小地方勝過大地方，如「娜娜」小說剛出版直至左拉領稿費買雨傘止的幾塲戲採用小斷片攝成，手法硃筆可下密　。例如像左拉法庭上大段演辭，究全要靠保羅茂尼說白的神態，在導演上說，未能算成功。保羅茂尼好在小動作，片子映完以後見戲　門口的保羅全身大廣吿，有栩栩如生之感。</p>
<p>泰山到紐約</p>
<p>在泰山片的按巧方面投，這還是上乘的一部，如象隊　開塲幾景都不曾與以前雷同，高杆鐵橋跳水一景極佳，</p>
<p>加國語對白說明，不敢予以贊成，至少在已有很久西片歷史的上海，恐不會受大部人的歡迎。</p>
<p>幸運先生</p>
<p>喜劇的題材，但貧乏喜劇的處理，卡萊與歹徒槍鬥一段很緊張，結尾欠周密，惟最後一塲　景還處理得不壞。</p>
<p>卡萊無理想中滿意，拉琳黛平平。</p>
<p>畸人豔跡</p>
<p>攝影上有小噱頭，譚尼凱的鬧劇演技可以稱誇，導演上無大成功，女主角新人薇琴妮梅雅平凡得很。</p>
<p>亡命之徒</p>
<p>這是一部可以看的「西部片」，頭尾都差，中段較好，新人格林福特頗有希望，伊芙琳凱絲亦佳，頭牌侖道夫史谷脫與二牌克萊亞屈蘭佛比較遜色。</p>
<p>沙漠情歌</p>
<p>伹尼斯毛根是失敗的，女主角愛琳曼寗極佳，歌喉亦甜，導演的手法平凡，細膩不够，英武不足，然而色彩尙佳，服裝如下過一番功夫。</p>
<p>新麗娃麗妲</p>
<p>「物女人賭聯贏」一塲最爲成功，一個「Q」字有異想天開的成功，可以呌絕；汽車上兜圈子一塲，在導演的處理上，可算上乘的一部份，其他很平凡。</p>
<p>不過，總評起來這部片子還是失敗的，失敗在對白多於演戲，有我國「獨脚戲」作風。</p>
<p>凱塞琳葛雷遜在此片中不能說有特出。</p>
<p>女兒城</p>
<p>導演處理的手法太另碎，編劇的取材也枯燥，以如此陣容演成如此成績，自亦在意料之中，因爲林達黛妮兒演此片時正是她在好萊塢下跌時代，她在此片中亦無成就，除面貌比其他女演員爲漂亮外，無特色。</p>
<p>春深了</p>
<p>梅蕙絲已無昔日風姿，也許是導演未對她有深切的硏究，編劇的台詞亦很馬虎，未取得效果。</p>
<p>片子不算高乘喜劇，但是又不曾製造可笑的鬧劇，舞台的塲面好像小足放大足，走不得大步子，連最後一塲主題歌舞都不會弄好。</p>
<p>演員</p>
<p>本週的演員演技最佳者：</p>
<p>（一）保羅茂尼（二）格林福特（三）譚尼凱（四）伊芙琳凱絲（五）愛琳曼寗。</p>

<h3>浮世繪</h3>
<p>— 謝紫</p>
<p>一個年老的俄國婦人，獨自在路上走着；她穿着一條油漬斑斑的鑲金花綢裙，上面是一件鼻烟色的外套，她那枯黃的頭髮，用帶子東成了一個醫，緊緊的護在後頭上，看上去呆呆板板的，一點飄動活潑的意韻都沒有。整個的她，就帶着那麽一股窒悶昏沈的鼻烟味，她拎着一隻網袋，網袋裏裝滿了零零碎碎的東西。路上有幾個小孩子在踢皮球，皮球踢到她的網袋上，她惡狠狠的向他們看了一眼，又很快的恢復了她原來的寗靜。她旣不在思想，也不在夢想，效的眼睛呆不無神，正像那陰雲密佈的穹蒼，也許比穹蒼還要灰暗點。她已經老了，一長串歲月——從光明到灰暗，從灰暗到更灰暗，在她總是一樣。這閑散活潑的黃昏世界與她是不相干的。她只希望快點回到家去，把網袋一扔，坐在牀上歇歇脚。</p>
<p>她就這樣子蹣蹣跚跚的走了問去。那一羣踢皮球的小孩子，也追着他們的皮球，連跳帶跑的追進一條弄堂裏。</p>
<p>這弄堂是非常幽僻而深遠的，弄堂口而兩面籬笆，籬笆上佈滿了零亂的爬山藤，看上去到像是一所幽樓的別默·一個三十多歲的女人，背着手，站在那兒，她渾身穿着碧綠色的西裝，一點也不美。却有一種揚揚自得的神氣·她正在同一個水菓攤販搭訕，另外還有幾個娘姨阿媽之類的人物，也參加了他們的談話——一羣婦女聚在一起言不及義的瞎聊天。出們的聲音却非常熱閙，如此的抑揚頓挫，和那樹林裏吱吱喳喳的麻雀聲，一樣的淸脆可聽，假如是個外鄕人，更該到這兒來領略一下她們的吳儂軟語；只是住在這兒的人，大半都聽慣了，並不以爲稀奇。到是弄堂外面一個小孩子的哭聲，引起了若十人的注意。這小孩，不知怎的，一交跌在地上，跌了個仰面朝天，他那跨張的哭聲，立刻驚動他的奶媽，她連忙跑過去，連哄帶騙的，把他帶到一個臭豆乾挑子跟前，買了一塊臭豆乾給他吃。那孩子，接了臭豆乾，也就不哭了，間始興頭頭的吃起來，朱紅色的辣醬，抹了一嘴。奶媽却並不理會，她彷彿又在出神了，把一雙眼睛有意無意的，打　着路上的行人。她也許正在想，想着她的丈夫，那沒出息不成材的丈夫，她己經嫁了他，又替他生了孩子，而她自己還得跑出來替人家做奶媽。想起來，眞是够委屈的。</p>
<p>她倚在一株梧桐樹上，輕輕的嘆了口氣，梧桐樹後面是一爿俄國小菜舖。低而黑的房子裏，放着各式各樣的小菜，櫥窗也顯得特別小，裏面擺着些罐頭食品，辣醬油，蕃茄醬之類的東西。舖子裏坐着兩個俄國人，陰暗，潮濕，汕膩，一付沒落民族的可憐相。菜舖旁邊是一爿五金店，樹窗比較大些，五金店，當然放着些鎚子，鑽子，釘子，銅壺等等，黃銅白鐵，相映成趣。一個年靑的店夥計，站在門口看報，臉上冷冰冰的沒有一點表情，正像那擺在樹窗裏的五金器皿。五金店過去，是一片蒼白色的光，看上去陰森森的有點冷，原來那是一支日光燈。電料店的樹窗畢竟有它的本色，那兒堆滿了燈泡，燈罩，燈口，燈頭，甚至於無綫電等等。肥而白的燈泡，瘦而黑的電綫，一律罩在那不可救藥的蒼白中。店裏面沒有人，一個全身工裝的電匠和一儡學徒，正站在　店門口，觀賞樹窗。那是一爿照像館，在紅色的燈光裏，放着各式　樣的照片；將軍的威　，女孩子的梁娼，老先生的茲祥，參　在一起。其中有一張照片特別引人注意，是一張俄國少女的眼片。這照片，無疑的，使這橱窗、這爿店，甚至這條街道。增　了不少春色，是一種炫耀的　辣辣的美，一看就知這是俄　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　、沒有英國人的　，　　　國少女所特有的結實　　　　　　匠正樓　小學徒在那兒竊竊談論，他當然是談論那少女，他自己也打算到那照像館裏去拍張照，拍得英秀而挺括，拿來和那俄國少女的玉服放在一起。啊，這眞是一個奢侈的夢想——</p>
<p>奢侈嗎？他　要更進一步呢！他想，這個俄國少女看到了他的服片一定會大爲感動，有一天她會走到照像館裏去，問那店老板，「這個俊美的少年是誰」？於是他，電匠，就要溫文爾雅的走到她面前，深深的鞠一躬，在彼此的注視中，他們認出了對方就是照像裏的英雄美人，於是他們互相愛上了，說不定他們還會結婚……啊，這更是一個荒誕不　的夢——</p>
<p>荒誕不覊嗎？在上海這地方，可無論什麽身份的人，都有資格做這種荒誕不覊的夢，誰能够預料呢？說不定有一天他得了一筆意外的財產，或者他作電料生意發了財；再不然，他因爲和那少女結婚而得到了她的財產，那時候誰不羨慕他？他將要坐了汽車，帶着他的　　，到這兒來兜風，憑弔一下他這苦出身的塲所，臉上帶着驕傲的微笑，向舊日的相識者頷首示意。可是他決定不再對他們作進一步的表示，以免有失身份；他也不打算在這兒長久逗留，他還要開了車子、穿過霞飛路，穿過　煦路，開到那熱閙的跑馬廳畔，然後把車子停在國際飯店門口，他將要挽了他的嬌妻，高視闊步，目中無人的走上去。這一來，整個上海就在他脚下了。</p>
<p>整個上海在他脚下，那也並不稀奇，他曾經爬到電綫木桿上去修過電綫，木桿有四五丈高，那時候，縱不是整個上海，半個上海總是在他脚下的。</p>
<p>這樣想着，他不禁得意起來，正巧離他不遠有一個糖炒栗子攤，他於是走過去，買了一千塊錢精炒栗子，請他的學徒小弟弟吃。</p>
<p>他一買，旁的人也去買了，於是在他一轉念之下，這栗子攤頭就做成了五千元的生意。</p>
<p>可是那站在炒煱後面的栗子大王，却並不感謝他，他還是拿着一把鐵　，爬呀爬的炒着。暗紅色的火光照在他險上，他臉上沒有笑，也沒有年靑人荒唐的夢想，他老了。</p>
<p>一陣「必栗剝落」的栗子壳扔在地下，秋風把它們當作落葉一樣看待，不住的往前吹，有的落在陰溝裏，有的落在三輪車的橡皮胎下，「拍」的一聲，從開花到結實的栗子的生命，從萌芽到新綠到黃綠的梧桐葉的生命，就這樣結束了。</p>
<p>雖然已經有樹葉落在地下，然而　有更多的樹　留在枝頭。這兒的樹本來很　，現在幾乎成了枝　　相交的樣子，一個人站在這兒，可以想象他是置身在一個幽寂的山洞裏。在山洞的出口處，可以看到那蒼茫的天光和一條褪了色的市街。褪了色而依舊不安份，電車汽車在不住的往來，小摩托在「撲撲撲撲」的放黑氣，有熱閙而沒有繁華，有呌囂而沒有歡樂。看了這條街，會令人回想到剛扌看見的錄衣婦人，它和她　都想用一種人爲的努力，去彌補他們的平凡。可是他們所給人的印象，却是種惡俗的炫耀。</p>
<p>突然有一部三輪車從這綠蔭蔭的山洞裏穿出來，車上坐着一個人，手裏拿了兩蒸汽油燈——兩朶使人奇異的　檬黃，大家都覺得奇怪、現在大　沒黑，爲什　點燈？坐在車上的人，却是一臉的滿不在乎，他這部車　要　續穿過許多路——，那呌　熱閙的路，富有詩意的路，十足都市風的路，甚至崎嶇不平的石子路，最後也許在一個小小的弄堂裏停下來。於是，這曾經使路人側日的兩朶檸檬黃，就算是　到了家，開始韜光養晦的，去渡它那小而又小的生涯了。</p>
<p>事實上，路上的一切行人，都將要回到家裏去，渡他們小而又小的生涯的，可是說來可憐，他們連這兩朶使人側目的檸　黃沒都有！</p>
<h3>嘉陵江（木刻）</h3>
<p>— 劉峴</p>
<h3>無聲</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>我懂得怎樣思想，可沒有懂得怎樣生活。</p>
<p>理想高遙得慷在雲端，現實却踹踏在黑暗和零亂裏面。火把跌落在水潭裏，撲嗤一來，什麽都就完了，當理想擠跌在絕望的深淵，還更能有什麽呢？</p>
<p>誰願意接近汚穢的惡魔？但是，當它逼向着你時，你生命裏蘊積着些什麼抗拒它呢？每個人願意把靈魂供奉得聖潔，摒絕着邪惡的誘惑，可一想起這些，不免戰慄起來。</p>
<p>像礦野裏微弱的呼喊，我的抗議只是默默而已。心頭的憤怒麽，也已經麻木了。抬起頭來，挺起胸來，我曉得，但是在低氣壓中，也許區　倒更顯得適宜。</p>
<p>站在自己而前的判斷，我是坦白的，狂潮噬吞不了我的堅靱的靈魂；然而在這些罪惡的堆裏，可能用什麽來洗刷？我常常要把自己裝飾得老練和勇敢，可是，藏着的還只是幼稚和脆弱。</p>
<p>我想呼喊，我又不想呼喊，懂得思想，思想使我痛苦，不懂得生活，生活却處處找來了碰壁。——我靜靜地把我口封了起來。</p>
<h3>窗</h3>
<p>— 以滔</p>
<p>我仍舊住在那個曾經建搭在寒冷的山城的帳篷裏，而帳篷也仍舊建搭在一塊市郊的廣塲上。所以我仍舊面對着一　自造的紗窗，而紗窗也仍舊正對着曠塲的遠極。</p>
<p>雖然我的行旅是多繁雜而獲化的，但當我停下我的脚步歇足在一處可以休息的地方，我的心却寗靜似一池春水。於是我一再建造我的小布屋，在小室度過一段冗長的日子。在這些日子裏，我是生活得無可奈何的，像一個囚徒得不到自由，我底心領導着我的翅膀被一種昏倦所　縛，而且久遠地解脫不掉枷鎖的苦刑。於是我只能對窗，描繪出許許多多的往事或前程，而往事正是團團灰白的露，前程像是五彩的朝霞，對於我自己的生命，却都是那麽微渺和不着邊際。</p>
<p>我已輕一再在　口候望，也許在金色的早晨或是陰晦的黃昏，像那些雨雪飄飛的日子。我候望着一個孩子的影子，仿佛　的影子是凍結了的，像一個旅人絕望在一座斷橋的河濱。我的琴絃斷了，我始終聽不見它的微音。要是太陽永遠不想啓程爲我們的大地晒照，她的影子便永不解凍，永不流向我的窗前。於是我憤怒地跳出窗子，任　雨摧殘我的　肢，我走到影子的跟前了，而她；正在溫熱的爐邊，給我一個與賤的淺笑。……</p>
<p>我的決心已不再允許我記憶着這些了。况凡我同那影子已遙遠在天北海南。但正爲了今天我同標對着窗、窗的啓示要我走回去，去尋訪那段崎嶇的山程。</p>
<p>好在現在已不是雪花飄飛的季節，而往昔所叩望的人也斷了音訊。此刻現出在窗外的是太陽燃燒着火的大地，和榴花正紅，靑草正碧的生命正强烈的季節。由此，我絕不會關斷了窗帘，闈　了眼，冥想一段往事。反而我讓陽光進來，讓風進來，如果我的窗口瀉躺有蔭影，我就奔跑出去，在陽光地裏奔到遠方。……</p>
<p>丙戌重陽將往蘭州留別</p>

<p>相逢相別幾幽州，大好山河競自頭，曠代烟塵胡忽忽？滿城風色自悠悠；少年不識三春樂，多故方懷九日憂；華夏火炎高屋在，昆岡此去建瓴游。</p>
<h3>贈別白石老人</h3>
<p>— 前人</p>
<p>湖山一老最傳神，天柱崢嶸九曲身；筆底含　偏入俗，刀頭無　却藏眞，高年獨醒衰淸士，亂世求全作舊民；紙上修文人不怪，秋風送客自由春。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　74</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>虎弟因知同行的人，有些看他不起，也許是忌他人小功大，所以他祗得單獨進行，捉了幾個逆宅的男女，盤問了些口供，又取了些牌照零星證件，背着人寫了這張字條給我。虎弟讀書不多，平常寫封家信，難免幾個白字，可決不致於像這張字條一般，寫得如此之槽。想必當時有些氣憤，而又慌亂，所以弄得白字連篇，句不成文。不過我覺得從此他的文字敎育，更常特別注意。這是我自覺「責無旁貸」的一個重要課題。</p>
<p>我看了字條，又問明了前因後果，剛在沉吟，虎弟的另一個快報員，也趕到這裏來，說是探問了幾處，扌找到這裏。「蕭虎城隊副失蹤了！」並說行動隊長已經知道了，立等我回總部談話。</p>
<p>照理，我應當立刻回部，報吿一切，大家磋商一個辦法，或由我負責將虎弟迫回，或同隊長擬定一個方式去搜勦雙龍　。但這第一第二兩點，僅　難辦到，縱令辦到，從此虎弟必不信任我；甚且弄得不好，就此發了牛脾氣，一扯腿跑了，對公對私，我都有些交待不過去。</p>
<p>說老實話，我也有意上雙龍塹探險一番。現在殷逆旣是藏在那裏，是個禍根，碰巧有了機會，祇需一粒子彈，就可送他下地獄。假便報吿上去，以雙龍塹，那種設備，恐怕把我們這一份實力，連同反正的保安隊，第十二團等，全體派去圍勦，也未必有功。弄得不好，還要白遭犧牲。况且，我們能在這個時候，把所有實力都調動去幹這比較不大迫切的工作嗎？</p>
<p>我把主意打定了，便吩咐兩個快報在這裏稍待一會，等我的快報人到齊，一路回部，我先走一步。說完這話，我又通知了捕逆的專員一聲，就趕到原來停車的地方。兩部車子還好好停在那裏。一問司機的勤務、知道虎弟並未來要車子。我知道虎弟不會開車，也不願勤務知道他的行蹤，大槪是僱車，或想別法走了。反正到翠姐那裏，不過十來里路。</p>
<p>當下我吩咐勤務留下一部車子，呌二人開一部回去，我還有一點小事要辦，十來分鐘就可回部，呌他們先去報吿一聲。我用這個方法，把他們二人調開，我就可以自由行事了。</p>
<p>二人走了，我檢査了一下油表，見還裝得滿滿，因恐隊長派人追尋便上車在城裏繞了兩倏街道，然後向雙橋開去。出城之後，過了我們自已的最外圍哨崗便把自已的裝束略略改變，臉上加了一　化裝色料，把臨時臂章除下，手槍的子彈匣。也檢視了一下；這是一把德式二十響，還是新的。爲了小心，車子進了眞正無人無崗地帶、我下車重新檢査一下把車上一應公事車的痕跡，都消除乾淨。不過我很奇怪，何以這條公路上，很長一段，不僅沒有人跡、連雙方哨崗巡哨都沒一個。</p>
<p>再走一段，到了一個岔道口，仍舊看不見人。我忽然瞥見那條岔道上，泥土鬆了車轍很多很亂，便把車子停在路旁、跳下車來，細心把這些車跡，檢視一下。南北都檢視了二三十碼，發見有輕重坦克，裝甲車，及各式大小車輪的痕跡。這些車跡都有些偏左，知道是向南去的行軍。「這是那專來的機械化部隊？」我反覆自己問着。因爲當時還沒知道，這是朝北直達雙龍聖。朝南直通平津公路的一條支路。</p>

<p>成都參議會爲了開放舞禁問題，會塲上舌劍唇鎗幾乎打出手。其中最精彩的是贊成開禁的幾句憤激語：</p>

<p>到過四川的人，就可以體會到這幾句話說出來時的悄調了。</p>
<p>實在說，與其偸偸摸摸，不如大大方方，公開是比秘密好，更何况跳舞也並非一件罪惡的事。</p>
<p>昨天，有個經常送信的郵差來我家兜賣火柴，還未等我間，他就說：</p>
<p>『先生！實在慚愧，一家數口，難以維持，沒有辦法，兜賣點小零碎來貼補家用。』</p>
<p>火柴並不比市上貴，自然我樂於接受；同時我也很尊敬這樣的人，至少他是將本求利，自食其力。</p>
<h3>浦江大橋　擴充市區建設</h3>
<p>上海市的範圍，並不僅限於以前的二個租界。它擁有十倍以外鉅大的面積。但是熱鬧的範圍，只侷處於上個較小的圈子裏。因此引起了屋荒，頂一幢住屋，要一百兩金子，租一間寫字間，也要好幾根金條。至於馬路上，人比螞蟻還多，車輛來往不絕，實行單程交通，仍舊不能改變阻塞的程度。</p>
<p>「擴充市區」，該是今後的呼聲了吧！以前洋涇浜阻礙了南北的市面，然而塡平了。蘇州河之隔，也有種種橋樑，把橋南浜北聯繫了起來，人爲可以勝過一切，在國內，貫穿黃河的大橋豈不是已有了三座：在國外，舊金山的金門大橋十年前就建築好了，至今還算世界上有名的工程奇蹟。</p>
<p>那麽區區黃浦江爲什麽仍舊一江之隔，猶比二個世界呢？大家都在想，如果有一座橋能够橫跨黃浦江，上海浦西的繁華，不就是立即可以達到浦東了嗎？實在市政經費少是一個原因，此外，江雖小而來往船隻却十分高大，未嘗不是一個很重要的因素。</p>
<p>像四川路橋，外白渡橋這種平坦如道路的橋，的確是不可能產生在黃浦江上面了，除非在浦江的南端。唯一可以解決的方法是籌建隧道，或者橋樑採用活動式的。據中國橋樑公司設計的，假定是一個雙開活動式橋樑，那麽橋下凈空在最高水位上十公尺，橋寬十二公尺，另加人行道，右左兩邊每邊三公尺，一共是寬十八公尺，坡度百分之四，橋內凈高六公尺。這橋如果按上述數字建築起來，是一座很平常的大橋，祇是輪船行駛時，連中型的都難於穿過，尤其是那些船上的旗桿，烟囱，瞭望台。所以採用雙開活動式，可避免之。</p>
<p>然而活動了以後，橋上如有汽車，電車，又將有所影響。所以理論上看，可將橋位提高，而坡度仍將在百分之四左右，如此設計以後，那斜率將延至西藏路附近，工程更感浩大了。</p>
<p>如採用隧道，坡度爲百分之四或五，凈高四公尺又四分之一，寬度按規定僅六公尺。只抵得上活動式橋樑的二邊人行道，又嫌太狹，不甚敷應用。</p>
<p>雖然，以上都是推測漫談，如要實踐，眞不知要化費多少金錢，動用多少人力，又需要多少時間；但是，你能說這是不可能的嗎？</p>
<h3>不過如此</h3>
<p>— W·W</p>
<p>繳了費，怕甚麽先生？大不了，下學期不來，此處不留人，自有留人處，「警吿」「大過」云云，不過如此。</p>
<p>圃他一下，取締黑市？黑市變白市，白市反變黑市！索性取消限價，黑白不分，其實亦難捨難分，嚴懲云云，只吃了一驚，不過如此。</p>

<p>由檢舉貪汚而嚴厲淸査，由執行淸査而適可而止，正彷彿是前天昨天的事，而今功德圓滿。這樣牽涉很廣的事，欲得水落石出，竟易如反掌，不過如此。</p>
<p>突然餓了一頓，着實難熬；經常餓慣了，也不過如此，活着腰纏萬貫，死了兩手空空，怎麼？不過如此？</p>
<h3>史地</h3>
<p>— 建華</p>
<p>報載上海世界輿地學社出版「世界新形勢地圖」，其中內容誤謬百出，如台灣與朝鮮，仍認爲日本領土。這不是荒唐到了極點嗎！</p>
<p>近來我國史地敎育的失敗，已漸漸爲一般學術界所公認了。報章雜誌所發表史地測騐的笑料，已經有好多起：如秦皇可生在漢武以後，袁世凱可爲淸朝的皇帝，徽州可爲安徽的省垣，赤峯可爲日本的小島，甚至高中一年級四千本卷子之中，竟有過半數不知道「九一八事變」發生於民國幾年。這種奇聞，眞令人嘆爲觀止，啼笑皆非過去八九年的書，不用說了，近來新出的中學史地敎科書，據我所知，多半仍是陳陳相因，拉雜成書，有的有書無圖，有的書圖不合，甚至也有像「世界新形勢地圖」等的荒謬絕倫，不但遺誤靑年，而且有關國體。</p>
<p>不過，現在各級學校不重視史地敎學，也負有很大的責任。學生上課時，室內除黑板桌椅而外，四壁蕭然，敎師口講指劃，敷衍了事；學生看小說，寫情書，隨便談談。如此這般，如何敎得出成績來！</p>
<p>最後，我希望公私立的中小學校，本學期收了許多學費，應該多備幾張有關史地的圖表，（敎局規定辦公費佔學費百分之二十至三十）不要使學生空坐敎室，丈二和尙摸不着頭腦；敎師方面也不要在加薪請願上費時間，應該注意一下預備敎材的工夫，莫再誤人子弟了。</p>
<h3>態度問題</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>社會上有兩種人。</p>
<p>乘電車時，如果你拿了一張壞票子，或者是缺一個角去買票，售票員很可能這樣說：「你有眼睛吧！」那麽你的回答與反應，也比他更厲害，弄得兩不愉快。假使售票員換一個方式說：「先生！請你換一張票好吧！」你的感覺與前者就有天壤之別了。</p>
<p>在街上走路或是坐火車汽車電車，當你正抽着一枝香烟，旁邊一位朋友向你借火，不得你的允許，馬上把你的烟借過去接火，或者是他向你說了一聲「對個火」，而沒有等到你的回答，邊說邊動的將你的香烟拿過去，這是一種人。還有一種人，他沒有帶火絕不向別人借火抽烟，或是很客氣的向你借火說：「請你借個火」。說完了還不動聲色，等你答應把烟遞給他才接火。這兩種人，他所需要的目的一樣，但是態度却差多。</p>
<p>固然表面謙讓的人，未必都正直，但這却不是你應該傲慢對人的理由！同是一句話，由於語氣與態度的不同，常有毫厘千里之別。仁慈有禮，永遠是合羣生活中的要件！</p>

<h3>星期雜談　關於一年十三個月</h3>
<p>（編者按：關於這一問題，原定在下次「星期雜談」裏討論，茲因接得來稿甚多，本週即開始，下次雜談仍爲這問題，讀者有意見，儘量惠賜可也！）</p>
<h3>不妨一試</h3>
<p>— 徐英</p>
<p>設非連年戰禍頻仍，改良曆法早該有像樣的成就了。</p>
<p>一九三三年國際聯盟常會上曾有將曆法提出討論，一時議論紛紜，各國代表對現行曆法——格里哥利曆（即陽歷）竟提出了一百八十五點不滿之處。</p>
<p>同時，各國曆法的不能統一，也使人遭受到不少無謂的困擾。有人曾經說笑話，說：「如果那一個人愛凑熱鬧，可以在一年內過三次新年，第一個新年（陽曆）在倫敦或紐約安渡，再趕到巴爾幹半島又可過一次（裘利安曆——斯拉夫民族奉行），最後乘飛機回到中國來還可以過一次（陰曆）」。</p>
<p>獨醉先生在自由談中重新提起了一年十三個月的改良曆法。這種曆法是由名叫波雪諦凡（Posltivist）者提出，所以就叫做波雪諦凡曆，一年十三個月，每月二十八天，新加的一個月，加在六月（June）和七月（July）中閱，定名叫“Sol”。年終多加一日，每四年在第四個年頭的六月底加一天，算是閏年。這種曆法好是好了，但正犯着一個大忌諱，瞧！一年十三個月，十三這個數字不祥殊甚，吏何况每個月的十三號都是星期五。</p>
<p>另外，有一種新曆法稱爲「世界曆」（World　Caleudar），將一年分爲四「季」（Quater），每季三個月，一個大月三十一天，二個小月三十天，共計每季十三個星期。每季始於星期日而終於星期六，年底加一個星期六，稱爲「年終日」（YearEnd　Day）。每四年加一日於六月七月之間，稱爲「閏日」（Lcap　Day）。</p>
<p>二次大戰前，「世界曆」曾引起大家的興趣，十四個國家決定在一九三九或一九四四年終時予以試用，但一九三九年至一九四四年皆在戰火瀰漫中渡過，人們腦筋中皆充滿了飛機，大砲，潛艇，坦克，何來餘暇改良曆法？</p>
<p>現在，大家不妨來試試吧！</p>
<h3>沒有道理</h3>
<p>— 金燮山</p>
<p>日曆的效用是在於帮助人類的記憶，任何人忘記了今天是什麼日子，可以對日曆上瞧上一瞧就可喚回記憶。實在對於固定每年十三個月，每月二十八天根本沒有關係。不然陽曆的二月是二十八天，七月八月有三十一天，這也都是每年如此固定的。假使因爲固定的緣故而可以不用日曆，那末我們現在也不是可以不用日曆的嗎？</p>
<p>由新曆再改爲「科學曆法」，實在沒有任何必要。當然我不會去反對一種合理的改革。不過，我覺得我們更需要過一些活潑的生活，任何事物一到了呆板的固定就要變成生趣索然了。我們固然需要整齊與叫朋，但是我們有時候也需要迎合自然與活潑。我們的雙手十指也並不是整齊的，固然它們還並不至於使我們覺得到難看的地步，但假使有人認爲看膩了而也必須要改變成爲一齊長短，這即使是可能的話，我想也並不一定對我們的工作上會有更多一種便利吧！</p>
<h3>新的建議</h3>
<p>— 楊蘭生</p>
<p>依稀記得在抗戰之前，世界曆法家發表所謂科學曆法，規定一年分爲十三個月，每月四星期，計二十八天，在年終大除夕一天定名爲一快樂的日子」，遇閏年爲二天。</p>
<p>自由談今天關於一年十三個月特地請大家考慮貢獻意見，此事看似無關重要，其實世界上的曆法，星期與時令不能相輔並進，密切合作，月份日子與星期參差而行，尤其是我國陰陽兩曆，還是陽奉陰違，陰陽怪氣。確是一件大憾事！假使將來改爲科學曆法，星期與月份日子有固定的規律可尋，這與社會民生眞是便利匪淺！</p>
<p>我承認科學曆法的成功地方有兩點：一，在於每月首日爲星期一二，全年五十二星期之外多餘一天列爲「快樂的日子」。但亦有未盡善處。最大缺點，即是一年十三個月却破壞了一年四季的怖令調序，失去科學的本意，所以科學曆法我們還不須要嚴格維持本來）年四季十二個月的成曆，不許隨意變更！</p>
<p>鄙人的意見：一年可分四季十二個月，每　三個月爲十三個星期，其巾兩個月爲四星期一僩月爲五星期。現在所要研究的是多餘一星期應當放置在第一個月呢？還是第二個月或者第三個月裏？其實隨便那一個月裏都成。</p>
<h3>官方醫院</h3>
<p>— 大夫</p>
<p>一位醫師的話　今年新春，我們思想。的×醫院成立了，我便進了這所設備相當究善的×醫院（在以前是日本人的一所著名的×醫院）裏面的藥品，器械，食糧，以及一切應用物品，應有盡有（單以×光講就有五架之多）可供十年之用；由此可見日本人雄心之一般</p>
<p>現在所剩的藥品，用了就算，器械也是損壞一樣少一樣，無從補充，沒有人過問，就是紗布綳帶用後可以經過洗滌消毒重複再用的東西，也就用了一次便丟了，那是爲什麽這樣做呢？究其原因是待遇太差，管理乏人，辦事沒有精神，大家都是抱着過一天算一天的</p>
<p>講到待遇，那更可憐，在今年二月這所醫院剛開門的時候，大家都想抗戰入年，整側中國受到了不少的敎訓，該好好的改造一下，達上眞眞光明的途徑，所以那時候各科醫師護士，以及茶役都很整齊，而有精神，直到四五個月以後，待遇　　那麼一點，平均醫　月薪七萬元，護士四萬，茶役五千，而外面的物價，已是一日千里；而院長總是說下個月要加幾倍幾倍來留人，而結果還是畫餅，充不得饑，直到目前醫師平均月薪十萬元，護士七萬元，茶役二萬元，院長還是說要加，就是加上一倍，也是弄不好，這幾個錢拿來又有什麽用呢！</p>
<p>至於伙食，更不用說，只有日本人所剩下的罐頭魚與牛肉，實在毫無營養價値，簡直像吃老的乾草，但是每天有，每頓有連吃了九個月，現在還在吃。我想將來還得吃。其餘是嗅的魚，老的草頭，不生不熟的洋葱；湯就是開水裏加些鹽，油根本沒有看見過，米不是糙的，就是黃的，嗅的，你要吃就是這樣，不吃也是這樣，現在每個人都是面黃肌瘦，再幹下去，祖保每個人者生癆病。</p>
<p>因爲待遇的叫人走上死路，毫無辦法生存，所以醫師護士走的很多，這麽大一個醫院，病床差不多百張，天天客滿，但是只有五位醫師，九位護士，所以工作相當的忙，有時候還要來一下出國士兵的體格檢査，每天就是三五十，限定日子要檢査完畢，眞是魯迅先生說的：「我們是牛，吃的是草，而擠出來的是牛奶」。</p>
<p>我就弄不懂，做官的老爺們有沒有父母妻子，兒女，那麽你們又怎樣的養活她們呢？難道你們每月也是十萬元嗎？何以就該住洋房，坐汽車，吃魚吃肉？</p>
<p>我們做醫師的，弄到實在沒有辦法的時候，最多不幹，不過我希望老爺們，動動腦筋，想法改革改革！這種情形我相信不只是我們醫院如此，每個國家機關都是同病，每個受軍人待遇的人都有同感。不過他們哭的時候强顏悅笑而已！</p>

<h3>Third Party Proposes New Suggestions; Main Content Focuses on Ceasefire; Publicity Regarding Truce Awaits Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Days of informal discussions have gradually become concrete. Third party figures, from the evening of the 25th to noon on the 26th, have been conducting individual visits. Chen Cheng, Wu Dingchang, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen and other prominent figures have been approached separately to conduct detailed discussions on ceasefire and various political issues. At 3 PM, another meeting was held at the Bank of Communications. First, each representative reported the results of their respective visits and integrated them for further study. Subsequently, the new suggestions of the third party were presented for discussion. As a result, it was deemed that the suggestions could be established. According to Luo Longji of the China Democratic League, these suggestions are a plan for a ceasefire. The section regarding point, line and surface mentioned in the Evening Post today has not been confirmed by any party. It is reported that the content of the plan is very detailed regarding the stationing of troops after reorganization, and both sides’ opinions have been taken into consideration. In addition to the ceasefire as the main content, it also touches upon the reorganization of the National Government, the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, and the draft constitution. However, currently, all parties have agreed to publicize the truce, so none are willing to disclose its contents. The third party’s meeting ended at around 6 PM today. They plan to hold another informal meeting with government representatives on the 27th, at which they will submit the suggestions decided on the 26th for discussion, and await the Chairman's return to the capital to seek instructions. At the same time, they will meet with Communist Party representatives to listen to their opinions. The development will depend on the expressions of the highest authorities on both sides within a day or two. A meeting was held at Sun Ke's residence at 6 PM on the 26th, attended by eleven people including representatives of the Political Consultative Conference, the government, Chen Cheng, Wu Dingchang, and Chen Bulei. Peng Xuepei and Shao Lizi reported on the proceedings of last night’s talks on publicizing the truce, which was then discussed until around 8 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 26th] Concrete measures for "publicizing the truce" were finalized last night and are divided into three points. It is reported that the content could not be announced on the 26th because instructions from Yan'an and the government have not yet arrived. Government representative Sun Ke told reporters tonight that he agreed with the principles of these measures, but the technical aspects still need to be studied, and it is necessary to see what the Communist Party's opinion is first. As for the CCP's opinion, Li Weihan telephoned Luo Longji of the China Democratic League at 2 PM to inform him that they had already agreed to two of the points and are currently seeking instructions from the Yan'an authorities.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai Visits Marshal; US Mediator Quietly Awaits Publication of New Suggestions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The American mediator is currently quietly awaiting the publication of the third party's new suggestions so that negotiations can officially begin. Ambassador Stuart was unable to contact the outside world this morning due to illness. Only Zhou Enlai visited Marshal at 11:30 AM for talks. Afterwards, according to the spokesman of the CCP delegation, it was just a normal visit, and there was nothing to report.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] CCP representative Zhou Enlai met with Special Envoy Marshall for more than three hours on the 26th. Observers here generally believe that Zhou's visit to Marshal reflects that the third party's mediation for peace has not achieved much. Although the situation seems to have made no progress, according to Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, he does not feel pessimistic at all. Chairman Chiang did not return to Beijing on the scheduled time on the 26th, resulting in the suspension of the agreement to stop the propaganda war and failure to sign immediately.</p>
<h3>Remarks by President Sun</h3>
<p>Reorganization of National Government and Executive Yuan is practically impossible.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Sun Ke answered questions from our reporter regarding the latest developments in the current situation on the evening of the 26th, as follows: Q: There are rumors that the CCP insists on reorganizing the Executive Yuan. What is the government's attitude? A: This matter has already been resolved by the Political Consultative Conference. Reorganizing the National Government Committee and reorganizing the Executive Yuan are both a matter of time. At the same time, simultaneous reorganization seems impossible, because the National Government Committee is like a mother, and the Executive Yuan is its son. If the National Government Committee is not completely reorganized, how can the Executive Yuan be reorganized? Without a mother, where does the son come from? If time permits, it should be completed before the National Assembly. Q: Must the draft constitution be passed by the Legislative Yuan? A: The May 5th Draft Constitution was passed by the Legislative Yuan. This amendment should also go through the legislative procedure of the Legislative Yuan. However, the drafting and review committee has not yet been held, the amendment has not yet been completely drafted, and the convening of the Constitutional Review Committee is pending the issuance of a ceasefire order. After various meetings are held, it can be held. Q: There are rumors that President Sun will concurrently serve as the head of the Executive Yuan. Is there such a thing? A: There is no such thing.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Assembly Representatives</h3>
<p>Telegraph Representatives from All Regions to Come to the Capital Early</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the National Assembly Representatives Association held a discussion meeting a few days ago to discuss matters related to reporting to Beijing. It was decided to urge National Assembly representatives from all over the country to go to Beijing to report or register as soon as possible to facilitate the progress of the meeting. The original telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"To all newspapers across the country, forwarded to the Liaison Branches of the National Assembly Representatives of all provinces and cities, and the public representatives of the whole country: The opening of the National Assembly is imminent. The members of this branch believe that this matter is of great importance and must be fully prepared in advance to be effective. We respectfully hope that all representatives will set off early and gather in the capital before November 5th to discuss everything together and contribute our efforts to facilitate the progress of the meeting. We especially telegraph to urge your arrival. The Shanghai branch of the National Assembly Representatives Association, Yin You."</p>
<h3>Special Longevity Hall Set Up in the Capital; Congratulating the Chairman on His Birthday</h3>
<p>Boy Scouts Perform Entertainment</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Lixingshe and the New Life Movement Headquarters have specially set up a Longevity Hall for citizens to freely offer congratulations. They are also exhibiting photos of the Chairman's life and holding various ball games and equestrian performances. They have been actively preparing in recent days and will host the press at 3 PM on the 28th to report on everything.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Boy Scouts of various schools in the capital will hold a grand and solemn birthday celebration for President Chiang's 60th birthday on the 31st at the large lawn of the Wuzhou Park in Xuanwu Lake.

<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 25th] The Central Headquarters of the Vietnam Nationalist Party considers the 31st to be President Chiang Kai-shek's 60th birthday. They have specially entrusted our Consulate General in Hanoi with two longevity screens made by the famous Vietnamese painter Nguyen Gia Tri to be transported to Nanjing and presented to President Chiang Kai-shek to celebrate his birthday, along with a birthday poem.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Reform Committee</h3>
<p>Discuss Party and Government Reform Plan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Capital Party and Government Reform Movement Symposium was held at the Central Party Headquarters at 2 PM this afternoon. More than 100 people including Liang Hancao, Liu Wendao, Xiao Zheng, and Yu Jingtang attended. Gu Zhenggang, Yao Dahai, and Li Jingzhai were elected as the presidium. After a brief speech by Chairman Gu Zhenggang, Lai Lian reported on the general situation of the committee's work, listing: (1) the formulation of various plans, (2) the effect of the solidarity movement, (3) the publication of the Reform Weekly, and (4) the promotion of the reform movement in various provinces. The meeting then proceeded to discuss the three reform plans of party affairs, politics, and economy. It was decided that the two reform plans on party affairs and politics would be reviewed and sorted out by the conveners of the Party Affairs Research Association and the Political Research Association together with the speakers. The economic reform plan will be left for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>CCP Spokesperson Discusses Current War Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] According to Mei Yi, spokesman for the Communist Party delegation, who made a statement on the evening of the 26th: Currently, the entire military and civilians in our liberated areas are engaging in self-defense bloody battles in eight places: (1) The Andong battlefield, where the National Army is advancing on three routes with determination. There is a possibility that Andong Prefecture will be occupied by them, but before confirmation from the Northeast Front and Yan'an, I will not comment on the possible consequences of this matter for the time being. (2) The Yantai battlefield, where the government navy and the army that is advancing north from Laiyang have been attacking since the 23rd, proving that the US request for foreigners there to evacuate on the 16th and 29th is related to this. It is estimated that serious consequences will occur at the end of the month. (3) The Northern Jiangsu battlefield, where Dongtai has been in fierce fighting for nearly a month, and the northern front is in fierce fighting in the Shuyang and Lianshui areas. (4) The Pinghan battlefield, where the National Army is trying to open up the Pinghan line, starting from Beiping in the north and ending in Anyang in the south. Currently, the main forces of both sides are engaged in fierce fighting on the line from Shijiazhuang to Liangxiang. In addition, the Yubei, Tongpu (southern section), Pingsui, and Cao Hai (southwestern Shandong) battlefields are also in bloody battles.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The Communist Party spokesman in Beiping issued a written statement today, stating again: "The government must fulfill the ceasefire agreement of January 10 and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference before there can be true peace." The spokesman also criticized the National Army for attacking Andong and Tonghua in southern Manchuria, Yantai in Shandong, and Lianshui in northern Jiangsu, and regarded this as a smokescreen for peace. Previously, a certain newspaper here published a news item stating that "the atmosphere of peace in Yan'an is strong," which was met with dissatisfaction from the Communist Party spokesman here. Now, a certain newspaper says that "the Communist Party spokesman in Beiping said: Although the atmosphere of peace is very strong, peace talks will definitely have no end." This written statement was issued in response to the above two news items.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting on Both Banks of the Cao River; Artillery Fire Heard All Night in Baoding; War Brewing in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Area</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 25th] The National Army north of Baoding once approached the city of Xushui on the evening of the 24th. Later, the Communist Army quickly reinforced, and the National Army turned to the north of the Cao River. Fierce fighting continued until noon on the 25th. Artillery fire was heard all night in Baoding.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] News of the progress of the National Army in the northern section of Pinghan has subsided. The Communist Army north of Baoding is active again. On the evening of the 25th, more than 20,000 people gathered near the Cao River and launched a fierce attack on various strongholds north of Baoding, engaging in fierce fighting with the National Army. At the same time, more than 1,000 Communist troops south of Baoding at Shunqiao and more than 4,000 Communist troops at Shenjia Ring also mobilized. Also, it is reported that the section between Zhuoxian and Songlindian officially opened to traffic on the morning of the 26th. The Songlindian station building has been burned down by the Communist Army. The Pinghan Railway Bureau has specially allocated two shed cars to be used as temporary ticket offices. The Railway Bureau estimates that it can open to traffic to Gaobeidian on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 26th] The National Army north of Baoding crossed the Cao River and advanced northeastward. Some fought fiercely with the main force of the Communist Army's Eighth Brigade and the New Sixth Brigade on both banks of the Cao River.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The Communist Army inside and outside the Great Wall is gathering 30,000 people in the triangular area of southern Chahar, northeastern Shanxi, and western Hebei, and has now entered the areas of Weixian, Guangling, and Laiyuan.

A certain military observer said: The Communist Army in Northeast China has now lost its last seaport to connect with the Communist Army in Shandong. The Communist Army inside and outside the pass will gradually become isolated. This winter, the National Army in Northeast China will focus on pacifying southern Manchuria. The next goal of the National Army entering Andong City may be Tonghua to clear the Sino-Korean border along the Yalu River. At the same time, the National Army on the Liaodong Peninsula should also abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and advance southward.</p>

The Chairman and his wife frequently returned the salute in the car, and then went to the Keelung Fortress Command for inspection. Commander Shi Hongxian reported the work of the department to the Chairman. After the report, they left the fortress command. The Chairman got out of the car at the entrance of the department and reviewed the honor guard. At 4:27 PM, he inspected two gun emplacements. At 5:20 PM, he went to the Yanghe of the municipal government to accept the warm welcome and respect of tens of thousands of citizens standing in the municipal government square. The Chairman gave a speech with a smile, saying: "Fellow citizens of Keelung, today Zhongzheng and his wife came to Keelung, and we feel very happy. Taiwan was occupied for 51 years and has now returned to the embrace of the motherland. I hope that the people of Keelung will work hard and strive to build Taiwan and build Taiwan into a model province, and Keelung into a model city. Today, Zhongzheng and his wife came to Keelung and received a warm welcome from the people of Keelung. We are very grateful. Finally, I hope everyone will work hard and wish you all good health."

In the 14th year of the Ming Yongli reign, Zheng Chenggong captured it. The first unit of the Japanese to occupy Taiwan landed in Keelung. Keelung Port is the starting point of Taiwan's maritime and land transportation and the hub of commerce. It also has good harbor facilities and can simultaneously dock 25 ships of 3,000 tons or more. In the eighth year of Xianfeng, Keelung, Tamsui, Anping, and Kaohsiung were opened as ports at the same time. During Zheng Chenggong's reign, this place was already the most prosperous commercial area. The port is surrounded by mountains, with only one side facing north, hence the old name "Chicken Cage." Because of its strategic nature, the port was subjected to 25 air raids during the war, and 70% of the city was destroyed by bombing.</p>

These Communist troops were previously transferred from Shandong to the Northeast for training and were equipped with new equipment. At the same time, the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu continues to invade southern Shandong. It is expected that the war on the Jiaoji Line will be more intense than before in the future.

<h3>East Tai Launches Siege Warfare: Over a Thousand Communist Troops Attacking Zhangdian Southeast of Taixian Repelled; Pacification to Be Implemented Along the Grand Canal Next Month</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang on the 26th by Our Newspaper] The Nationalist troops, having arrived in the outskirts of East Tai city, launched a siege and counterattack this morning. However, the Communist troops stubbornly resisted with artillery fire, and as of the time of this dispatch in the evening, the two sides were still engaged in fierce fighting. Furthermore, over a thousand Communist troops attacked Zhangdian, southeast of Taixian, on the 25th. After a day and night of intense fighting, the Communist troops were finally routed.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang on the 26th by Our Newspaper] According to military figures who recently arrived in the province from Shiyan, a recovered area in northern Jiangsu, the Nationalist troops advancing towards East Tai from the southeast are approaching the city in a fan-shaped formation, rather than adopting an encirclement tactic. This clearly leaves an opening on one side, intending to allow the Communist troops to retreat towards southern Shandong along the Fan Gong Dike. Currently, the waterway between Xinghua and East Tai leading to Yancheng is almost completely blocked by the large and small boats used by the Communist troops to transport supplies, numbering over a thousand. It is also reported that some of these civilian boats have been impounded by the Communist troops for more than two years.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taixian on the 25th by Our Newspaper] On the morning of the 25th, the headquarters of a certain division had already moved to Liangdui. This reporter accompanied Division Commander Li to inspect the artillery positions. Through special binocular telescopes, the Wen Temple and a pagoda in the southeastern corner of the East Tai urban area could be seen very clearly. Liangdui is located 18 li (Chinese miles) from East Tai. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, the recovery of East Tai will not have to wait until the end of this month.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taixian on the 25th by Our Newspaper] This reporter arrived at Liangdui, which had just been recovered this morning, with the army at noon on the 25th. The residents have long suffered from the harsh rule of the Communist troops and regard the Nationalist army vehicles as saviors, doing their utmost to assist them. All Communist troops are currently retreating towards the Sanzhao area, and the Nationalist troops are advancing in search, having already crossed Sanlidian.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taixian on the 25th by Our Newspaper] This reporter traveled from the frontline at Liangdui along the Tongyu Highway to Haian at noon on the 25th. Military vehicles traveled endlessly along the road, and the rising dust fully demonstrated the tension of the wartime situation.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Yangzhou on the 26th by Our Newspaper] It is reported that the military has completed deployments in the important areas of various townships and districts in the recovered areas along the Grand Canal. Pacification will be implemented starting next month, and the Ministry of National Defense plans to send key personnel to the pacification zones to inspect and supervise. It is also learned that although the Nationalist troops and the county governments have made arrests upon entering the recovered areas, no one has been killed except on the battlefield. Therefore, the people who were coerced are all coming forward to the government to turn themselves in.</p>

<h3>Liaoning Delegates to the National Federation of Commerce Talk About the Current State of Industry and Commerce in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Takeover Work Too Slow, Major Factories Unable to Start Production, Worries About Future Crisis When Foreign Goods Flood In</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th by Our Newspaper] Li Zaofang, a Liaoning delegate to the National Federation of Commerce who came to Nanjing, told a reporter on the 26th: "If we want China to become rich and powerful, there is no other way than to build a new Northeast. If the Northeast prospers, the establishment of a new China can be expected soon. The Northeast is rich in resources, and its industry and commerce have already established a foundation in recent years. The price we have paid to transform it is indeed great, but the Northeast has a truly great potential in the future." According to him, there are a total of twenty-one delegates from the Northeast attending this National Federation of Commerce meeting, representing five provinces. In the past fourteen years, the Northeast has been isolated from everything in the motherland due to oppression by the enemy and puppet regimes. They are also not very familiar with the government's economic policies and measures, as well as the domestic industrial and commercial situation. They plan to take this opportunity to have more contact with industrial and commercial leaders from all over the country, and also plan to meet with heads of ministries to request instructions and to express the grievances of their fellow countrymen in the Northeast. After the meeting, they also plan to go to Shanghai to gain a better understanding of the economic capital.</p>
<p>Li continued to talk about the current state of industry and commerce in the Northeast, saying: "After the enemy surrendered, they left behind an excellent industrial and commercial foundation in the Northeast, which is a great boon for both the local and national levels. Our fellow countrymen in the Northeast also have great hopes for the future of industry and commerce in the Northeast. Unexpectedly, all kinds of unfortunate events occurred after the victory, causing the entire territory to be scarred and everything to be waiting to be rebuilt. At the same time, the takeover work was also too slow, causing most of the major factories to be unable to start production. If this continues, when foreign goods flood in in the future, it may be impossible to rebuild the industry in the Northeast. This is what our fellow countrymen in the Northeast are most anxious about and hope the government will handle as soon as possible." When talking about the difficulties faced by industry and commerce in the Northeast, Li said, "What we currently feel is most difficult is the inconvenience of transportation. Materials cannot flow smoothly, so raw materials cannot be transported in, and finished products cannot be exported, causing industry and commerce to fall into a state of paralysis. For example, the current price of rice in Shenyang is 27 yuan per catty (a Chinese unit of weight, approximately 500g), while in Jilin it is only 4 or 5 yuan per catty. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, rice from Jilin cannot be transported to relieve Shenyang." Another difficulty is the lack of power. Electricity has been damaged, and coal also cannot be transported in, so less than one in a hundred factories in Shenyang are operating. In addition, what hinders the development of industry and commerce in the Northeast is the currency system. Due to the problems with the circulating notes, the value of the currency is falling daily, and prices are rising daily. For example, rice was only sold for 3.5 yuan per catty in February of this year, but today it is already sold for 80 yuan per catty, a dozens-fold increase. Some of the red banknotes have been recovered, and counterfeit ones are also occasionally appearing. Currently, the main export from the Northeast is soybeans, while the main import from within the country is cotton yarn." Li said at the end: "The Northeast does not lack skilled workers. On the contrary, there are many unemployed workers because factories cannot start production. The Northeast urgently needs funds, and we hope that this issue can get the assistance of all parties."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 25th] This agency has exclusively learned that Ambassador Chen Zhiping, after formally taking office, discussed three nationalization bills that discriminate against Overseas Chinese with Philippine Vice President Quirino for the first time today. Chen protested against the nationalization of market stalls, a bill signed by President Roxas on October 1st, which stipulates that only Filipinos are allowed to operate stalls.

He admitted that he had published a declaration in the Zhonghua Daily in the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic (1939) when the puppet government returned to its capital, responding to peace. However, when it came to joining the puppet government, he falsely claimed that he "usually admired Wang (Jingwei) and mistakenly believed that what he called peace talks was a tacit agreement with the central government, so he also joined, just like 'If I don't go to hell, who will?' He followed Mencius' ancient teaching that 'the people are the most important, and the state comes next,' to reduce the suffering of the people in the occupied areas. This is just like in the history of the Song and Ming dynasties, those who were able to sacrifice themselves to protect the nation's culture and the country's vitality could eventually be restored." Traitor Jiang was cunning and evasive, always avoiding the important points and making absurd arguments during the court's questioning. Then, traitor Zhou Fohai was summoned to court to testify. Zhou testified that Jiang's appointment to a puppet position was recommended by Japanese Navy Admiral Suga. Jiang firmly denied this, saying that he knew Suga through Wang Jingwei. Each held to their own version of events. Later, the prosecutor debated with Jiang and his defense lawyers, Ge Cheng. At 1:30 PM, the court adjourned the trial and set the sentencing for November 2nd.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th by Our Newspaper] The Capital High Court opened a court at 3:00 PM on the 26th, with Judge Ge Zhitan and Judges Ge Zhaotang and Yang Yutian retrying puppet Tianjin Mayor Pan Yugui. Traitor Pan wore a black jacket, looked haggard, with thoughts filling his forehead. He was accompanied to court by his youngest son, Pan Ming. He spoke about serving the country and the people, often feigning deafness and dumbness. He found it difficult to refute the sharp questions from the presiding judge, Ge, and at times was vague and evasive. The court inquired about his actions during his various puppet positions, such as burning national language textbooks, arresting central agents, and forcibly conscripting civilian land, laborers, and food to support the enemy. After questioning, the debate began. Prosecutor Wang Wenjun listed other criminal facts and the reasons for the prosecution. Then, Pan and his defense lawyers, Ye Zaihang and Yang Jialin, successively defended. At 5:30 PM, the court adjourned the trial and set the sentencing for November 1st.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Crux of US-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>Pearl Harbor, United Press Agency, 24th dispatch: US Pacific Fleet Deputy Commander Vice Admiral McCormick is currently touring the Pacific and China to inspect military bases. The day before yesterday, he told the press in Pearl Harbor: "The United States must maintain a strong network of bases in the Pacific to defend against atomic bombs and other new types of weapons. The best defense for the United States is to keep any future enemy from the West at a distance. This would prevent a 'Pearl Harbor incident' from happening again in the future." From this brief statement, it can be seen that the United States' vigilance in the Pacific has never slackened. Although the goal of the US's adoption of this policy is to maintain peace and security, it ultimately gives the world the impression of a posture of preparedness for war. Especially in the eyes of sensitive countries, it is an even more serious threat.</p>
<p>In recent days, because the United Nations General Assembly opened in New York, representatives of 51 countries gathered on the shores of Lake Success. Everyone has great expectations for the success of the United Nations General Assembly. President Truman has formally stated that the United States will use all its resources to support the United Nations organization. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also stated that the Soviet Union will make contributions to the United Nations General Assembly to enable it to complete its mission. At the same time, he hinted that if the United States and the Soviet Union act with sincerity and goodwill, they will be able to reach a mutual understanding and all difficulties can be easily resolved. In theory, US-Soviet relations are expected to improve, and all the haze between the two countries will not be difficult to sweep away. However, on the one hand, some countries at the United Nations General Assembly are demanding the withdrawal of the veto power, and on the other hand, the Soviet Union is demanding that the General Assembly Secretariat delete the cases related to the discussion of the abolition of the veto power from the agenda. Both sides are tending to extremes, and even the Cuban representative is striving for it with resignation, and the Soviet Union is unwilling to show weakness, almost leading to a stalemate. The United Nations General Assembly encountered a major difficulty shortly after its opening. This is also sufficient to illustrate that it is not an easy task to demand that the United States and the Soviet Union resolve their suspicions, make peace, and work together to support the United Nations organization in maintaining world peace.</p>
<p>The above two news reports, one is that the United States wants to maintain strong military bases in the Pacific, and the other is that the Soviet Union is determined not to give up its veto power. On the surface, they are two unrelated things, but in reality, they have a very close relationship. May I ask why the United States wants to maintain bases in the Pacific? May I ask why the Soviet Union wants to abuse its veto power? Obviously, it is due to the mutual suspicion and mutual defense between the United States and the Soviet Union, and their unwillingness to trust and tolerate each other, to seek peace in cooperation, and to seek security in peace. No matter how beautifully the political diplomats of the United States and the Soviet Union say and advocate US-Soviet cooperation, both sides have their own strengths and seek only their own security, regardless of the life and death of others. For example, for its own security, the United States wants to maintain strong bases in the Pacific and elsewhere, regardless of whether the Soviet Union feels threatened. Similarly, for its own security, and to prevent others from besieging it, the Soviet Union also wants to expand its security zone, regardless of how the United States feels. But we must further ask: Why do the United States and the Soviet Union want to do this? The political diplomats of the United States and the Soviet Union are not without far-sighted people. Of course, they also understand that US-Soviet cooperation is not only a blessing for the world, but also beneficial to both sides themselves. Conversely, US-Soviet separation and going their separate ways is not only a catastrophe for mankind, but also a disaster for the two countries. Knowing it and doing it anyway, how can this be explained?</p>
<p>These incomprehensible riddles have recently also aroused debate between the pens of the United States and the Soviet Union. First of all, the Soviet Union's "New Times" magazine published an article attacking the domestic and foreign policies of the United States, expressing great doubts about the United States' search for bases around the world. The Soviet political commentator Zaikin asked in a suspicious tone: "Since the complete defeat of Germany and Japan, why does the United States still need to frantically search for bases in every corner of the world? Who do they need so many bases to oppose?" American reader Pan Jinzi immediately wrote a letter to answer from the standpoint of the American people. He said: "Isn't your Soviet Union also expanding its borders like our United States, making its surrounding neighbors 'friendly countries'? The US government is preventing World War III, just as France immediately began to build the Maginot Line after World War I. So the US government, like the Soviet government, does not believe that peace can be ensured solely by intangible principles such as friendship and morality." After reading the American reader's reply, Dai Qin was still unconvinced and wrote another article published in "New Times" to defend himself again. He said that several questions about diplomacy are closely related. Since the end of the war, the reactionary forces of Britain and the United States have expanded. They are unwilling to cooperate with the Soviet Union and other democratic countries, but only attempt to make them submit. They deliberately organized the Anglo-American group to expand its power to the world. Even the American people say loudly that after World War II, mankind has entered the 'American Century'."</p>
<p>In this pen war, everyone has their own reasons, and each can justify himself. After reading it, we only feel that we have fallen into a fog of confusion, and are even more confused about the fundamental contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union. But generally speaking, it can be observed from two aspects: one is the conflict of ideas, and the other is the conflict of interests. Ideologically, the Soviet Union is a socialist Soviet country, and the United States is a capitalist democratic country. Although both claim to be democratic countries, they are two completely different democracies. From the Soviet perspective, only the Soviet system is true democracy. For example, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov gave a speech at the Paris Peace Conference, openly attacking British and American-style democracy as 19th-century democracy, and claiming that Soviet democracy is 20th-century democracy. In the British and American view, the current Soviet system still belongs to the political system of an omnipotent country, not true democracy. Professor Fei Fei, an expert on Far Eastern issues in the United States, came to China to lecture and frankly criticized the Soviet Union's democratic politics, saying: "The Soviet Union's economic methods are commendable; if she gives the people the freedom to vote, then I would also be willing to join the Communist Party." This struggle between the two democracies is the ideological conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, in the current international arena, realism is all the rage, and ideological conflicts may not hinder international cooperation. On the eve of the outbreak of World War II, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which were sworn enemies, also turned enemies into friends and signed a non-aggression treaty. The joys and sorrows of the international community have nothing to do with ideology, and the real key lies in interests. Therefore, Professor Fei Fei also said: "Ideology is not a big relationship, the main thing is international interests. So it often goes wrong."</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, the highest interest of the Soviet Union is peace and security; the highest interest of the United States is also peace and security; it is just that the peace and security required by the two countries are different. In the Soviet Union's view, after this war, it has gained a bloody lesson. What it needs most now is peace, to build a socialist country in an atmosphere of peace; secondly, it also needs security, to not worry about being besieged by other countries. But if the Soviet Union does not come out to lead world peace, it will never be truly reliable and permanent peace; and if there is no large security zone around the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union will never be able to rest easy. This is the Soviet Union's perspective on interests. On the American side, in order to achieve world peace, it does not hesitate to make significant sacrifices and resolutely participated in this war. After three or four years of hard fighting, it was finally able to achieve a slow victory, but after the pain, the only goal of the United States in the future is to maintain world peace and avoid the recurrence of war. However, the growing strength of the Soviet Union, whether for Europe or for the Far East, is ultimately felt to be a serious threat, and it is necessary to prepare for the future and prevent problems before they occur. Although the United States is very willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union, it cannot help but be wary of its strength. Why is the United States unwilling to disclose the secrets of atomic energy publicly, and must the Soviet Union first announce its political and economic demands on the world? This is entirely due to the United States' inability to rest assured, and its suspicion of the Soviet Union. Therefore, they become the cause and effect of each other, which has created an increasingly tense situation between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although US Secretary of State Byrnes said that the American people have extended a hand of friendship to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is still apprehensive and dare not extend its hand. Therefore, US-Soviet relations have not improved so far. This is the crux of US-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>In short, the center of gravity of today's world is entirely on US-Soviet relations. Mankind is looking forward to peace and urgently expects the improvement of US-Soviet relations, just like a severe drought hoping for timely rain. The political diplomats of the two countries, who bear a historical mission, should focus on the crux of US-Soviet relations, and then use their great wisdom and courage to transform hostility into peace between the United States and the Soviet Union, and at least restore the spirit of wartime cooperation to jointly create world peace. This United Nations General Assembly is an excellent opportunity to serve as a starting point for the improvement of US-Soviet relations. We hope that the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries can cherish this valuable opportunity. During this period, there should be less inappropriate remarks to avoid stimulating each other's emotions.</p>

<h3>The People in the Recovered Areas of Northern Jiangsu are Suffering / The Provincial Government Requests Exemption from Land Tax / Military and Civilians Cooperate to Rush to Repair the Highway Along the Canal</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Zhenjiang dispatch] Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Wang stated that the counties in northern Jiangsu have been occupied for eight years, and the enemy and puppets have collected food and taxes, and plundered in every possible way. The people are almost destitute, and the countryside is bankrupt. Last year, the central government exempted taxes, but northern Jiangsu, which is in dire straits, did not receive any real benefits. At present, the collection of land tax is very difficult. Yesterday, he specially requested the central government to sympathize with the people's difficulties and approve the exemption of land tax in the newly recovered areas of northern Jiangsu for 1946 to show compassion.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Zhenjiang dispatch] According to Zhang Jingcheng, director of the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau, the current situation of rushing to repair the highways north and south of the Yangtze River is as follows: In northern Jiangsu, after Shaobo, Gaobao, and Huai'an were successively recovered, the Construction Department and the Bureau separately rushed to repair the main highways in the counties in order to cooperate with military needs. As of now, the Shaobo Daji Bridge started construction in September and was fully completed on the 17th. The bridge is extremely important on the canal line. Now, with the cooperation of the military and civilians, the highway along the canal from Yangzhou to Gaoyou Baoying has been repaired and opened to traffic, and the road surface is being reinforced. The highway from Baoying to Huaiyin is currently being repaired. Once completed, the Bureau plans to operate regular passenger and freight vehicles. The highway between Fengpei Xiao and other counties near Xuzhou and Huaiyin is currently being planned for repair. In southern Jiangsu, the highway from Zhenjiang to Jurong is being reinforced with the roadbed and bridges are being built. The highways from Zhenjiang to Wujin, Wujin to Jiangyin, Wuxi to Shanghai, and Changshu to Fushan are currently being actively planned for repair in addition to finding ways to improve the road surface.</p>
<p>[Taixian dispatch] Jiangyan, Qutang, Baimi, Hai'an, and Huangqiao in Taixing, which belong to Taizhou in northern Jiangsu, have been recovered by the national army. However, the people have suffered severely from the disaster and urgently need relief. It is reported that the Suning Branch of the Executive Yuan has decided to allocate 50 tons of flour to Jiangyan, Qutang, and Hai'an respectively, 20 tons of Baimi, and 100 tons of Huangqiao, and has sent inspector Yu Pu to investigate and release emergency relief.</p>
<h3>Provincial-Level Financial Difficulties Disappear / This Month's Expenses Are Not Enough / There Will Be No Money Next Month / The Director of the Finance Department Goes to Beijing Again to Ask for Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Hangzhou 26th dispatch] Zhejiang's provincial-level finances have reached the extreme of difficulty. Even official salaries have to be patched together to cope with the situation. Our newspaper's reporter specially visited the person in charge of the provincial government to ask about the reasons. According to his analysis: (1) Although the revenue and expenditure system was reformed in July, the Ministry of Finance delayed the transfer of business tax to the provincial government for management until October. From July to September, the province only collected 200 million yuan, which has not yet been transferred to the Finance Department. (2) The Ministry of Grain approved the case of collecting land tax at a 50% discount too slowly, and it only started to be collected recently. (3) The Provincial Government's revenue and expenditure comparison table for the second half of the year has not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan. According to unofficial news, the Executive Yuan has revised it to balance revenue and expenditure. It is not known which items have been deleted, but in fact, there is no way to recover the expenses from July to October. (4) The central government originally decided to include the revenue from land tax in kind at 10,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) of grain into the provincial budget, and the excess revenue from sales would be used to adjust the treatment of civil servants. Recently, it was heard that the central government changed it to 13,000 yuan, the price difference was reduced, and the source of adjustment was exhausted. (5) The Ministry of Grain originally planned to purchase the portion of the tax collected for the province to adjust the provincial finances. Recently, it was heard that it would only allow the purchase at the budgeted revenue price, and only pay one-third of the deposit payment first. Then the excess profit will all belong to the Ministry of Grain, which will not benefit the provincial finances or civil servants. Chen, the director of the Zhejiang Finance Department, decided to go to Beijing again tomorrow to ask the competent authorities for instructions because the provincial financial deficit is increasing day by day, and the expenses for the second half of October cannot be fully paid, and there will be no money in November. Chen has only been appointed as the director of the department for four months, and has already gone to Nanjing five times, which shows the difficulty of local finances.</p>
<h3>Restoration of County Levels in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Hefei dispatch] The 62 counties in the province were originally divided into six levels before the war. During the war, many were either upgraded or downgraded according to actual needs.

(2) Second-class counties: Huaining, Lihuang, Huoqiu, Guangde, Xuancheng County, Boxian, Hexian, Wuyiwu, Dangtu. Fengyang and other ten counties. (3) Third-class counties: Chuxian, Shucheng, Linquan, Guoyang, Mengcheng, Fengtai, Xiumi, Huaiyuan, Xuyi and other nine counties (4) Fourth-class counties: Taihu, Taihe, Lujiang, Yingshang, Mingguo, Jingxian, Guichi, Nanling, Chaoxian, Lingxian, Dingyuan and other eleven counties (5) Fifth-class counties: Susong, Hanshan, Huoshan, Yuexi, Qimen, Jixi, Qingyang, Zhide, Quanjiao, Hanshan, Dongliu, Tianchang Twelve counties.

<h3>Jiading Stipulates Vehicle Prices</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Jiading dispatch] The police bureau of this county, in view of the fact that in the past, ordinary rickshaw pullers often charged arbitrarily when they encountered foreign travelers, and even quarreled when they disagreed, in order to reduce trouble for travelers and maintain fairness, specially convened a meeting of car owners and pullers to discuss and decide to set a principle of 300 yuan per li (unit of distance), which can be appropriately increased or decreased depending on the length of the road. Those who take round-trip cars in the same section can calculate according to 90% of the original car price.</p>
<h3>Wuxi County Councilors / Dispute Over the Number is Undecided</h3>
<p>The county magistrate submits a request for deliberation to the provisional council</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Wuxi dispatch] The formal election of county councilors in this county will begin soon, and all relevant parties are also preparing to run for election. However, the distribution of the number of councilors for professional groups has not yet been resolved. The Chamber of Commerce has declared its withdrawal due to the small number of places.

After receiving the letter, the council has scheduled a meeting on the 29th of this month to jointly study and make a decisive suggestion, and then submit it to the province for instructions to determine the number of places.</p>
<h3>Boatmen Plot to Kill for Money / Cargo Owner Pushed into the Sea</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Wenzhou dispatch] A junk sailing ship from Shanghai, loaded with yarn, cloth and other goods, worth tens of millions of yuan, was transported to Jinjiang, Fujian. Unexpectedly, on the way, the cargo owner of the ship was pushed into the sea by the boatmen. The boatmen sailed the cargo ship to Yingbu'ao, Kanmen, and planned to sell all the goods and make a fortune. However, it was finally revealed that the local people saw through it. The boatmen, fearing misfortune, fled with their crimes and disappeared. The goods in the ship were dispersed by local hooligans. The incident shocked the neighborhood. After hearing the news, the Yuhuan County Government sent personnel to investigate on the 18th of this month. It was indeed the case. The ship and the goods were detained and the original stolen goods were traced. After inspection, the goods have been escorted to the county government for safekeeping yesterday to wait for the owner to come and claim them.</p>
<h3>Yuyao Holds Council Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Yuhang dispatch] The county council held its second general meeting on the 23rd.

<h3>Giant Traitor Wang Nihua Jiu Flees / The High Court Prosecutor's Office Files a Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Bengbu dispatch] Since the recovery of Bengbu, most of the traitors arrested and sanctioned have been figures in the political and economic fields. Cultural traitors did not seem to have been noticed by all parties in the past. Until recently, the famous cultural traitor Wang Nihua Jiu was reported and prosecuted by the First Branch of the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office here. It is learned that Ni Hua Jiu's original name was Zuyin, and he is now 50 years old. He is from Xuyi, Anhui Province, and graduated from the Anhui Provincial Public Law and Politics College. When Chen Diaoyuan was the governor of Anhui before the Northern Dynasties, Wang founded the Bengbu Political News Agency in Bengbu. After Hua ordered the army to Bengbu, he founded the Bengbu Daily and served as a correspondent for the news agency. Later, he also practiced law, and was greedy and shameless, and was despised by gentlemen. Because of his close relationship with the giant traitors of Anhui Province, Ni Daoyi, Kang Shaohou, Zhang Jinyu, etc., after Bengbu was occupied, they colluded with the traitors and established the Bengbu Maintenance Association and the Refugee Rehabilitation Committee, following the wishes of the Japanese invaders. Wang Ni served as the secretary of the Maintenance Association and dealt with the enemy, and then served as the president of the Bengbu Branch of the Greater People's Association, promoting peace and spying on military intelligence for the enemy. Last month, it was reported that the First Branch of the High Court Prosecutor's Office held that both the Greater People's Association and the New People's Association belonged to the enemy's intelligence agencies, and that the traitor had promoted peace and spied on military and political news for the enemy, which was a crime under Article 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. Prosecutor Shi Jingquan filed a public prosecution according to law. However, the indictment could not be served because the traitor Wang was hiding and there was no trace of him. Therefore, the indictment was served by public announcement in accordance with Article 59 of the Criminal Procedure Law. According to a side interview with the reporter, Wang was indeed a popular figure among the traitors during the enemy's occupation. Shortly after the victory, he fled to Beiping. Wang has a villa in Bengbu, called Zaiyuan, in front of the electric light factory in Renshouli, a Western-style building with lush flowers and trees, quite like a forest garden. Wang's family still lives here.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Distributes Food Boxes</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Qingpu dispatch] The Songjiang Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office sent a letter to various agencies in this county yesterday, asking them to collect surplus US military rations, which are divided into breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and are packaged in boxes. The selling price of each type is 900 yuan in national currency, and each person is limited to one serving (one type each for breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Those who want to buy them need to bring money to Songjiang to order them.</p>
<h3>Cases of Robbery in Gucheng Lake Pile Up / Three Major Bandits Have Been Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Gaochun dispatch] Gucheng Lake, located in the southeast of this county near the urban area, covers an area of tens of miles, reaching the foothills of Xuancheng County, Anhui Province in the south. It is a waterway hub between Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, and the area through which goods must be transported and sold. Therefore, merchants from all over gather. Before the war, there were water police and life-saving boats from the life-saving bureau in this county patrolling the lake day and night to maintain security in the lake and rescue ships that had lost their way. They have not been restored to this day after the victory. In recent months, robberies in the lake have occurred frequently, and the safety of ships passing through the lake is worrying. The county administration often sees this and urgently needs to crack down on it and arrest the bandits in order to maintain security. A few days ago, the county security team specially dispatched many team soldiers, disguised and stationed in the jurisdiction of this county to detect the crimes. In the theater in Zhangjiagou Village, Liaotianba, the second district of this county, they detected a young man carrying a gun. They immediately questioned him and answered evasively. They believed that he must be a bad person and immediately escorted him to the county government. After interrogation, it was found that he was the bandit leader Ding Dehong, a native of Dangtu, Anhui Province, who now lives in Yuanbao District, Wuxi. He confessed that he had robbed many times in Gucheng Lake, including one time in March, one time in May, and another time on the 7th of this month when he robbed Tao, a merchant, of cloth and other items. Ding's main accomplice, Ding Defeng, originally lived in Gaotou Village, Wuxi. When he heard the news that Dehong had been arrested, he left his original place and lurked in Dingbu. As the news of the case became increasingly tense, he was uneasy and planned to escape to Yongyang again. However, when he passed through Caotang Township in this county, he was questioned by the local joint defense self-defense team. They believed that the circumstances were suspicious and arrested him and sent him to the county. After interrogation, he told the truth. The two criminals also confessed that Zhang Yugui in the Yudda Grain Store in Dongba was also an accomplice, and said that the gun was supplied by him. Although he did not come out to rob with them, he divided the loot in the store. Zhang Yugui is originally from Shandong and is a military man. During the period of occupation, he served as the intelligence director of Shencunbu in the 15th Independent Brigade of the Puppet Army. He opened the Yuda Grain Store in Dongba in June of this year. He was also arrested and is currently under strict interrogation.</p>

<p>Guards Open Fire and the Whole Car Escapes</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Wuxing dispatch] Yu Shuluan, commissioner of the second district of Zhejiang Province, was ordered to Jinji on the 16th to attend the provincial water conservancy conference. After finishing his official business, he took the Hangzhou-Changxing passenger car back to Huzhou on the morning of the 23rd. When the car arrived at Penggongling, a crossroads on the Yuhang Highway, six bandits suddenly rushed out, all holding guns, and ordered the car to stop. Yu's guard, Shen Kunlong, immediately took out his wooden shell and shot. The bandits, seeing that the situation was not good, fled backwards. Although all the passengers in the car were frightened, they all escaped safely.</p>

<h3>National Health Conference: Zhejiang Province Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 26th Dispatch] The National Health Conference is about to open. Xu Shilun, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department, will soon go to the capital to attend. Mr. Xu is carrying several proposals, including: (1) Proposing to emulate the distinction between pharmacists and pharmacy students, establishing physicians and doctors as a two-tiered system to standardize titles, and renaming pharmacy students as pharmacy technicians to establish a public health system. (2) Suggesting that the Ministry of Education require nursing and midwifery schools to add courses in dispensing and testing to better serve rural health needs. (3) Proposing to establish a personnel system for medical affairs, raise salaries, recruit medical personnel, and restrict private practice to lay the foundation for a public health system. (4) Proposing that the Executive Yuan stipulate the percentage of points allocated to the health department in the performance evaluation of commissioners and county magistrates to facilitate the implementation of health administration.

However, very few tea merchants voluntarily declared their taxes.</p>
<h3>Huangdai Bully Arrested: Villagers Request Extreme Punishment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] Zhu Keting, a local bully from Huangdai Town in the county, was adept at currying favor with the enemy during the occupation, serving as a puppet Baozhang (village head) of Xili Township, tyrannizing the local area, colluding with the enemy police in everything, and harming the people. After the victory, realizing he could not escape punishment, he fled and disappeared. Recently, with the atmosphere easing, he secretly returned, but remained unrepentant. On the 16th of this month, taking advantage of the marriage of Xing Ahu, a villager in the township, he colluded with the local self-defense corps and went to extort money from a villager from Houzhai Town among the wedding guests. When the extortion failed, the two sides scuffled and entered the Huangdai District Office. The paratrooper unit of the Suppression and Joint Defense Zone stationed in the area learned of the incident and immediately dispatched personnel to arrest Zhu. Today, he was transferred to the Yangcheng District Suppression Headquarters for interrogation. The local villagers have jointly petitioned for him to be executed to appease public anger.</p>

<h3>Power Plant Planned on the Shores of Taihu Lake: Can Supply the Needs of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The preparatory office of the Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau of the Resources Commission is actively planning a large-scale power plant on the shores of Taihu Lake to supply the needs of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The bureau originally planned to build a 750,000-kilowatt power plant, but due to various difficulties, it can only build a 200,000-kilowatt plant. Currently, Shanghai alone needs 200,000 kilowatts of power. Bao Guoding, the director of the bureau's preparatory office, and Zhang Jiazhi, the general manager of the Jibei Electric Power Company, were ordered to switch positions yesterday. Mr. Bao has departed for Jibei.</p>
<h3>"Sun and Moon Rising Together" Spectacle: Feast Your Eyes on "Yingke Peak"</h3>

<h3>Wu Cangzhou to Wujin to Investigate: Malfeasance in the Auction of Enemy Property</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin Dispatch] The Wujin Office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, in its previous auction of seized materials, had unreasonable and unfair valuations and improper procedures, leading to distrust from public groups. The Provisional Council, taking the lead, listed the corrupt acts of the office in a complaint to the Investigation Team, requesting a thorough investigation. On the 24th, the Second Group of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Seizure Investigation Team first sent Wu Cangzhou to Changzhou to conduct a preliminary investigation. It is reported that Mr. Wu's trip is primarily to thoroughly investigate eight major cases of corruption: (1) An enemy inland river vessel, capable of holding over eighty people, was valued and auctioned for only 70,000 yuan, less than the price of firewood. (2) The auction of over 24,000 gunny sacks, valued at 700 yuan each. The valuation committee considered the price too low and requested a revaluation, but the director of the office insisted on the original price. (3) The enemy-built concrete wharf and five bungalows in Dongjiao Zhoushi were directly valued at 2.5 million yuan by the office, which was also inappropriate. (4) The Songgang Yoko Brewery of the Bo'ai Men, with production equipment worth over 20 million yuan, was valued at only 11 million yuan. (5) The case of extortion of cigarettes for a house from a small shop in Xianxiang. (6) To whom was the homespun cloth sold? (7) Was Wang Xiaobao's land in Xinping Town sold? (8) The auction of scrap iron, worth 300,000 yuan per ton at the time, was auctioned for only 90,000 yuan per ton. In addition, the entire machinery and equipment of the Songgang Weaving Factory were underestimated by several experts at 39 million yuan. The office unilaterally allowed a certain factory to purchase it preferentially for 9 million yuan, resulting in a loss of 30 million yuan in national treasury revenue.</p>
<h3>Preparations to Resume Publication of the Huzhou Commercial News</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxing Dispatch] Before the war, seven newspapers were published in Wuxing: Huzhou Public News, Husheng Daily, New Husheng Daily, Huguang Daily, Huzhou Commercial News, Guolun Daily, and Hu Bao. All were suspended for financial reasons, except for Hu Bao, which moved west with the army during the enemy occupation and resumed publication on Double Ten Day last year after the victory. Now, Feng Jiuru and others plan to raise funds to resume publication of the Huzhou Commercial News, with a tentatively set fund of 10 million yuan. The funds have already been raised, and they are currently submitting an application to the relevant authorities for filing. Publication will resume as soon as approval is granted.</p>
<h3>Change of Guards for Military Police on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] The 15th Military Police Regiment has been stationed in Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Shanghai, and other places along the Nanjing-Shanghai Line, responsible for city defense and train escort duties, for half a year. It is now confirmed that the highest military police authority has ordered the regiment to concentrate for training. In addition to reviewing various academic subjects, skills, and duty skills, they will also be re-educated on various new knowledge related to military police tasks.

It is reported that the change of guards will be completed within ten days. The regimental headquarters will remain in Wuxi, and a battalion of troops will be stationed in Suzhou.</p>

<p>The Problem of Greater Shanghai's Development</p>
<p>I have previously submitted letters to your esteemed column twice regarding suburban transportation and requested that they be forwarded to the relevant municipal authorities. I am extremely grateful for your publication and reply. I am now reading in the newspaper that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has concrete plans for the development of suburban transportation (especially in the former city center area of Jiangwan) and will implement them, which is very gratifying. In fact, the importance of transportation in the city center is no less than that in the urban area. Considering the current situation in the urban area in terms of population, residents, housing, and transportation, the scope of Greater Shanghai is too narrow. Unless suburban areas are developed to expand the urban area, it will not be able to join the ranks of world-class cities. Even the current municipal difficulties cannot be resolved without doing so. However, if we want to develop the urban area, we must first develop public transportation to attract residents to move there gradually and bring prosperity. Among the suburban areas that can be developed as extensions of the urban area, the city center area is the most suitable. Because the area should not be regarded as a suburb, but as the core of the New Shanghai. Before the war, Mayor Wu Tiecheng planned to develop the area as the municipal center, and considerable progress had already been made, which could rival the former concession area. Although the concessions have now been recovered, the facilities within them, such as the road system and wharves, do not meet the standards of a modern city. Therefore, in addition to that area, we must build a new, modern Greater Shanghai to meet the needs of the times. From the above facts, the revitalization of the city center area is urgent. The municipal authorities have long been aware of this, so their first step is to set up public bus routes to facilitate transportation with the current urban area and as a prerequisite for the construction of Greater Shanghai. Now that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has made this decision, it should restore public buses in the city center area. However, due to the issue of vehicle assembly, the date of implementation must wait until the beginning of next month. I only hope that the Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau will not merely promise something without delivering, to appease the urgent needs of the citizens. I feel that there are several points that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau should pay attention to and be responsible for answering: (1) What will be the route of the vehicles going to the city center area in the future? Will it be the same as the routes operated by the former China Merchants Public Bus Company? (2) Can the planned No. 7 public bus route be extended and opened to traffic first to shorten the preparation period? (3) If the second point is not possible, when can the transportation in the area be effectively restored at the earliest? Which route number will it be, and what will be its starting and ending points? All should be announced as soon as possible. (Wei Zhesheng)</p>
<p>Please Strengthen Postal Delivery</p>
<p>Since the victory and recovery of Shanghai's postal service, business has been booming. According to people in the industry, the number of postal items has exceeded pre-war levels. With the population of Shanghai being dense and increasing compared to pre-war levels, it is no wonder that communications between various places are becoming more frequent. Those who communicate all hope that the postal delivery is fast. The postal authorities responsible for delivery are always trying to achieve the fastest possible efficiency within the possible range. However, judging from recent postal correspondence, it is far less fast and satisfactory than before the war. According to people in the industry, the reason for the recent delay in postal delivery is that transportation in various places has not yet been restored, and there are fewer employees handling postal affairs than before the war, resulting in a sharp decrease in efficiency. This is an unavoidable situation. I believe that increasing the number of postal employees is something that is possible. Why doesn't the Postal Bureau strengthen the efficiency of postal delivery? Why not add personnel, which can also alleviate unemployment? As for the economic gains and losses of the postal service, it should be regarded as another matter. The state-run agency was originally established to serve and facilitate the public. (Chen Xin)</p>
<p>Residents of Western Shanghai Call for Road Repairs</p>
<p>We, a group of people who have lived in Hongqiao Road for generations and rely on growing and selling vegetables for a living, have many intersecting roads here. Hongqiao Road and Zhongzheng West Road run vertically. The area north of the roads belongs to District 25, and the area south belongs to District 26. The people living on the horizontal roads all have to pass through Hongqiao Road and Zhongzheng West Road. Hongqiao Road is narrow and has many cars. The section of Zhongzheng West Road near Chengjiazhai was excavated and turned into a swamp by the enemy during their occupation to build their defensive works. Since then, the roads have been muddy when it rains, making it difficult for us vegetable vendors to walk, especially since Zhongzheng Road cannot be traversed east-west, which is unsightly and very inconvenient for transportation. We hope that the Public Works Bureau will connect this road east-west to facilitate public travel. (Tu Shuren)</p>
<p>Please Include Road Names in Theater Advertisements</p>
<p>The major movie theaters and theaters in Shanghai do not include road names in their daily advertisements, so people coming to Shanghai from inland areas often want to see the good plays at various theaters, but they are unable to find the theaters because they do not know which road they are on. They can only sigh in vain when they see the advertisements. We hope that the major theaters will include road names when publishing advertisements in the future. We would be very grateful. (Zhuang Ke)</p>
<p>Sludge from Canal Dredging Flows Everywhere</p>
<p>The entrance to Meifuli Alley at Anyuan Road and Jiaozhou Road in Western Shanghai is blocked by foul-smelling canals. Although the authorities recently sent personnel to dredge the canals, the workers are not only ineffective in their work, but also deliberately negligent, piling the excavated sludge on the roadside without using wooden frames to contain it, causing mud to spread everywhere, hindering pedestrians, and emitting a foul odor due to solar evaporation, which is detrimental to both sanitation and transportation. We hope that the authorities will pay attention to this matter and order a prompt improvement for the sake of public convenience. (Wei Hongqing)</p>

<h3>The Issue of the Five Powers' Veto Right: Resolved to be Included in the UN General Assembly Agenda; Chinese Chief Delegate Gu Weijun States Three Reasons; The Soviet Union Ultimately Voluntarily Withdraws Its Request</h3>
<p>[United Press New York 25th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly's Steering Committee, with the accommodating attitudes of the representatives of both the United States and the Soviet Union, decided today to submit the thorny issue of the veto right to the General Assembly for open discussion. The Soviet Union had originally requested that this issue not be included in the agenda, which had raised concerns about causing another conflict between the country and the Western powers. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky suddenly announced today that he was withdrawing the original proposal, and the situation turned from dangerous to safe. US Representative Austin had previously led the opposition to the Soviet Union's request and had proposed that the veto issue be immediately submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. However, due to the Soviet Union's concession, he announced that he would also withdraw his own proposal. With the settlement of the US-Soviet dispute, the veto issue was decided by Chairman Spaak to be included in the General Assembly agenda as usual, and then submitted to the Political Committee for discussion. Austin also declared that the Soviet Union's willingness to compromise proves that this world organization is bound to succeed. The General Assembly's Steering Committee is composed of fourteen countries. The Soviet Union initially formally proposed that the veto issue should not be included in the General Assembly agenda. According to Vyshinsky, any change to the veto right provisions of the United Nations Charter would be a major blow to the United Nations organization. The United Kingdom and the United States immediately opposed this, arguing that the reason for their opposition was not that the veto right stipulated in the United Nations Charter should be changed, but that the General Assembly should not be deprived of the right to discuss this issue. The leaders of the opposition were British Representative Shawcross, followed by Cuba and Australia, who proposed that the veto issue should be discussed in order to decide whether it should be restricted or abolished. Representatives of six countries, including China, spoke out against the Soviet proposal.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency New York 25th Special Dispatch] Our Chief Delegate and Vice President of the General Assembly, Gu Weijun, forcefully stated in the Steering Committee the reasons for keeping the thorny veto issue on the agenda, which can be said to represent the general situation of the General Assembly. He stated that the Chinese delegation attaches great importance to Article 27 of the United Nations Charter regarding the voting procedures of the Security Council. Mr. Gu presented the following three reasons for supporting the proposals of Australia and Cuba on the General Assembly agenda: (1) The two countries' proposals are in line with the spirit of the Charter, (2) placing the proposals on the provisional agenda is in accordance with the rules of procedure, and (3) since the entire issue of the veto right has aroused great concern and anxiety around the world, an open and transparent discussion of the issue by the United Nations General Assembly will have a "beneficial effect" on public opinion. Mr. Gu told the Steering Committee that although China is a country that has the right to apply this veto right, it has never exercised this right, because the Chinese government believes that the rule of unanimous consent should only be used in important situations, so its use should be exercised with the utmost care and distinction. Mr. Gu concluded by saying that the General Assembly's discussion of the veto issue may not have concrete results, but at least it can clear the world's atmosphere. China currently does not want to endorse any decision to convene a full United Nations conference, because there is no need to amend the principle of unanimous consent. Mr. Gu declared that China will issue a more detailed statement on its views on the veto issue in the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Fifty-Three Items on the Agenda Distributed to Six Subcommittees; The United Nations Secretariat Makes Recommendations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York 25th Special Dispatch] The United Nations Secretariat today submitted a recommendation to the Steering Committee to distribute the 53 items on the General Assembly's provisional agenda to six major subcommittees. The Secretariat also recommended that the Political Security Subcommittee be assigned some of the most contentious issues, including: (1) Requests for countries to join the United Nations, (2) Reports of the Council, (3) India's protest against the South African Federation's mistreatment of Indian people, (4) Three proposals regarding the veto right, (5) The issue of United Nations member states stationing troops in non-enemy territories, (6) Drafting a declaration of the rights and obligations of all countries. Secondly, the Economic and Financial Subcommittee will discuss: (1) The economic and financial report submitted by the United Nations Secretary-General, (2) Determining actions to resolve the world food shortage, (3) The report of the United Nations General Assembly, (4) South Africa's request to merge the South West Africa Trust Territory, (5) Reports from United Nations member states on non-self-governing territories. The final allocation of agenda items will be decided by the Steering Committee, and then submitted to the General Assembly for approval along with its recommendations.</p>
<h3>British Representative's Speech: Criticizes Abuse of the Veto Right; But Opposes Amending the Charter</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York 25th Special Dispatch] British Representative Noel-Baker, in his speech to the General Assembly today, was able to fulfill his dual responsibilities. As the first speaker of a major power, he responded to the criticisms from small countries about the lack of achievements of the United Nations by recounting the accomplishments of the United Nations since its establishment. In addition, as the spokesman for the United Kingdom, he strongly declared his opposition to any proposals to amend the Charter, but also frankly criticized the Soviet Union's "unrestrained use of the veto right." He earnestly requested his Soviet colleagues not to indulge in the use of this right. However, he defended the right to disagree of major powers in the Security Council, and suggested improving the rules of procedure of the Security Council and adding a new spirit to the work of the Security Council. He strongly defended the Security Council and asked the General Assembly to support it. Mr. Noel-Baker went on to express confidence in the trusteeship system and attacked "plundering imperialism." He expressed his firm belief that the trusteeship system will become a driving force to eliminate the evils of imperialism.</p>
<h3>Control of Atomic Energy: Soviet Union Reiterates Belief</h3>
<p>[News Report] San Francisco 26th Broadcast: Today, Soviet Representative Gromyko reiterated in the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission the Soviet Union's belief that the control of atomic energy can be handled by each country independently, formally denying the rumor that the United Nations has held secret negotiations on the atomic energy issue. Last night, British Representative and Minister of Aviation Noel-Baker fully supported the US proposal to control atomic energy in the United Nations General Assembly, stating that if an international control method for atomic energy cannot be established, the result will inevitably lead to competition in atomic energy. Mr. Baker stated that this competition is currently underway and may plunge the world into chaos.</p>
<h3>Investigating Foreign Troops: The Soviet Union Raises an Old Issue; Requests that it be Included in the Agenda</h3>
<p>[United Press New York 25th Dispatch] Today, according to sources close to the British delegation, the United Kingdom will not oppose the Soviet Union's proposal to investigate the issue of United Nations troops stationed in non-enemy territories for discussion by the United Nations General Assembly. This issue was previously rejected by the Security Council for inclusion in the agenda. The Soviet Union then raised the old issue again and included it in the provisional agenda of the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Indian Representative Delivers Stirring Speech: Criticizes "Imperialism"; The Discrimination Against Overseas Chinese in South Africa Should be Subject to Public Judgment; Also Requests a Seat on the Council</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse New York 26th Dispatch] Indian Representative Mrs. Pandit (the younger sister of Nehru) delivered a stirring speech lasting thirty minutes at today's United Nations General Assembly session, which won enthusiastic applause. Mrs. Pandit requested that the United Nations grant India a position in the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council, saying that India must undertake a task commensurate with its geographical position and its wartime contributions. Looking at the current world, power still prevails over justice. In political, economic and social terms, it is still dominated by imperialism. Some countries are willing to violate the principles of the United Nations Charter to achieve their own desires. We demand that from now on, all actions to defend the interests of imperialism by force and to suppress the desire for national independence should be prohibited. As far as East India is concerned, Indian troops are being used to fight against the local national army, and this situation must be stopped. The minority of Indians in South Africa are currently being mistreated and should be subject to public judgment by the General Assembly. As for the South African government's request to merge the South West Africa Trust Territory into the South African Federation, the Indian government hereby declares its opposition.</p>
<h3>300 Overseas Chinese in South Africa Separately Punished with Fines</h3>
<p>[United Press Durban, South Africa 25th Dispatch] 324 Indians here, accused of infringing on municipal property, were tried in court yesterday and were sentenced separately, with fines ranging from $20 to imprisonment of three months. Gandhi's son, Manilal, was also among them. This is the largest trial since the Indians here launched a passive resistance movement. India has already appealed to the United Nations General Assembly about the mistreatment of the minority of Indians in South Africa.</p>
<h3>Latin America and the Arab League Form a Group: To Enhance their Position in the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York 26th Dispatch] Latin American and Arab League countries, which together account for more than half of the United Nations, have reportedly formed separate groups to give their political views a stronger voice in the United Nations General Assembly. Argentina convened a meeting of twenty Latin American countries over the weekend to discuss general issues related to South America, which was the first hint of the above attempt. The Latin American countries' meeting will decide on Mexico's successor in the Security Council and Colombia's successor in the Economic and Social Council. Judging from the current signs, the Latin American countries will support Colombia to participate in the Security Council, while Uruguay seems to be moderately between the too right-leaning Argentina and the too left-leaning Venezuela. Among the Arab League countries, it is reported that Syria will definitely replace Egypt in the Security Council. It is also reported that the Arab countries have decided to oppose any proposals to hand over the mandate of Palestine to the United Nations for supervision during the discussion of the trusteeship issue.</p>
<h3>Request from La Guardia for the United Nations to Take Over the Work of UNRRA</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 26th Dispatch, United Press] Lai Yi has received a warning from La Guardia, Director-General of UNRRA, stating that after UNRRA's dissolution in early 1947, Eastern Europe, Italy, and China will face crises and unrest. La Guardia's report has been submitted to the UN General Assembly, requesting the Assembly to have a "comprehensive proposal" on how to supply relief needs after UNRRA ceases providing relief materials. The report includes an analysis of the economic situations in countries such as Greece, Albania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Australia, and China.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria to Hold Elections Today; U.S. Government Declares It Will Guarantee Free Elections Despite Soviet Opposition</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beijing, 26th Dispatch] The Protection Council is scheduled to be re-elected tomorrow. In addition to the Communist Party and other four ruling parties of the Fatherland Front, the competing parties include the National Agrarian Union, the Bulgarian Democratic Party, and the Social Democratic Party. The Communist Party within the Fatherland Front has the greatest influence and seized power in Bulgaria two years ago, breaking away from the Axis and joining the Allied camp. It first won the election last November. The opposition parties requested a postponement of this election on the 10th of this month, stating that free elections are impossible under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: The U.S. State Department declared today that the Soviet representative on the Allied Control Commission for Bulgaria opposed the U.S. proposal to send personnel to supervise the elections in Bulgaria this Sunday, and stated that this attitude is equivalent to refusing to recognize the previous agreement, which requires that all measures concerning Bulgaria must be mutually agreed upon by the U.S., the U.K., and the U.S.S.R. The U.S. plan advocates counting the ballots on the spot, without consolidating them first, to avoid delays, and dispatching personnel to supervise at each polling station. However, Soviet representative Biriuzov believes that this is tantamount to interfering in Bulgaria's internal affairs and is unacceptable. The U.S. court issued a warning today stating that the U.S. government, unwilling to be deterred by Soviet opposition, intends to implement its pledge to guarantee free elections. However, the State Department has not disclosed what actions it intends to take.</p>

<h3>British-Egyptian Negotiations Reach Another Stalemate; Sudan Demands Independence</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th Dispatch] The negotiations on the British-Egyptian treaty have reached another stalemate. Both sides' representatives are tight-lipped as to whether it will be moved to Cairo. Egyptian Foreign Minister Hafez Ramadan and Ambassador to the U.K. Sami, after visiting Prime Minister Attlee, went to the British Foreign Office, presumably to discuss ways to break the deadlock. According to those around Attlee: The future status of Sudan is more important than the withdrawal of British troops.

If Sudan does not obtain independence, it is willing to be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations. Egypt's demand to obtain sovereignty over Sudan is only motivated by expanding its territory. The Sudanese and Egyptians are completely different ethnic groups. If a referendum is held, the majority of Sudanese will advocate breaking away from both Britain and Egypt and becoming independent.</p>

<h3>The First Difficult Problem in the United Nations General Assembly: The Use of the Veto Power</h3>
<p>— (This Newspaper's Research Department)</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly officially opened in New York on October 23, and the world's attention has shifted from Paris to New York again. However, after seeing the sharp confrontation and numerous disputes between the U.S. and Soviet blocs at the Paris Peace Conference in the Luxembourg Palace, peace-loving people around the world cannot help but feel worried about the potential achievements of this United Nations General Assembly and dare not have excessive expectations. However, after all, countries around the world are hoping for peace and stability, and we do not need to be overly pessimistic about the complicated international situation. In this General Assembly, we can already see several difficult problems. If the two opposing blocs can cherish the hard-won peace and be mutually tolerant and accommodating to seek a reasonable and appropriate solution to these problems, then the success of the General Assembly can be predicted. These difficult problems, such as the great powers' veto power, the issue of territorial trusteeship, the European refugee relief issue, etc., will definitely spark a fierce debate at this General Assembly. Here, we will analyze and introduce the origins, background, and current situation of these issues one by one, which can also help readers understand what dark reefs are lying beneath the surface of world peace.</p>
<p>Now, let's start with the first difficult problem, the "veto power." The veto power of the great powers is a legacy of power politics. In 1944, the U.S., U.K., the Soviet Union, and China gathered at Dumbarton Oaks in the United States to discuss the organization of a future world peace organization for the first time. The Soviet Union strongly advocated that powerful countries must have special privileges in the future international organization. Therefore, in the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, no decision was made on the issue of voting methods in the world organization. It was not until the Yalta Conference in February 1945 that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin agreed on the principles of the Security Council voting method in the future world organization. This later became known as the "Yalta Voting Formula." This formula was adopted by the San Francisco Conference and incorporated into Article 27 of Chapter 5 of the United Nations Charter, which reads in full:</p>
<p>"(1) Each member of the Security Council shall have one vote. (2) Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members. (3) Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members including the concurring votes of the permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter VI, and under paragraph 3 of Article 52, a party to a dispute shall abstain from voting."</p>
<p>This third point is very important, because it includes the so-called veto power of the great powers. We know that the most important mission of the United Nations organization is to resolve difficulties and disputes, turn hostility into friendship, and enable countries to resolve international disputes and conflicts peacefully at the table, instead of resorting to arms on the battlefield. The burden of this heavy and sacred mission is not borne by all members of the United Nations General Assembly, but by the Security Council. Therefore, the Security Council is the de facto guiding and executive core of the United Nations organization. The Security Council is composed of eleven countries, including the five permanent members: the U.S., U.K., the Soviet Union, France, and China. The remaining six countries are non-permanent members, elected by the General Assembly. When discussing so-called "procedural matters," the eleven countries are completely equal, and as long as seven countries agree (that is, more than one-third), the motion can be passed. However, when discussing all other matters other than procedures (i.e., so-called "substantive matters"), the status of the eleven members is not equal. The passage of each substantive matter requires not only the approval of a majority of seven or more votes, but also that the seven votes must include the votes of all five permanent members. In other words, the U.S., U.K., the Soviet Union, France, and China each have such great power that even if ten of the eleven votes agree, if one of them votes against it, the motion is overturned. This is the so-called "veto power."</p>
<p>The problem lies here. First: How exactly is the strict distinction made between "procedural matters" and "substantive matters?" In fact, larger matters belonging to international disputes are of course substantive matters, and the veto power can be used. Second: Although the use of the veto power also has some limitations, that is, the provision in Chapter VI of the Charter and paragraph 3 of Article 52 that "when the Security Council is endeavoring to achieve a peaceful settlement of an international dispute, a state party to the dispute, even if it is a permanent member of the Council, shall not participate in the vote," the interpretation of this provision has also become a major problem, with differing opinions. Some argue that this limitation only applies when a "dispute" has occurred, and does not apply to any "situation" that may cause international friction or disputes. Here, the problem arises again: How should the strict distinction be made between "dispute" and "situation?" International issues are often very complex and delicate, and it is not easy to distinguish them so mechanically.</p>
<p>The initial provision of this veto power in the Charter also had its unavoidable difficulties. Because if the Security Council's mediation of a dispute fails, it can also have the power to impose economic and transport blockades, sever diplomatic relations, and even use force against countries that undermine peace. All these things would be very difficult to implement in practice, and might even lead to the opposite result, if the five permanent members did not agree and take consistent steps. Although countries in the world should be equal regardless of size, in fact, the status of the five great powers is much more important, and in order to enable them to reach mutual agreement and avoid turning against each other, the establishment of the veto power is a good way to prevent things from completely freezing, and the intention cannot be said to be unkind.</p>
<p>However, this method set up for positive goals has become a tool for passive resistance. At the Paris Peace Conference, many issues could not be discussed at all because the Soviet representative repeatedly used the veto power. The widespread use of the veto power will further make the United Nations organization and the Security Council nominal, unable to do anything. Countries have deeply felt this pain, especially the smaller countries, which are preparing to propose the abolition of the veto power at this General Assembly. As for the position of the major powers, President Truman made it clear in his speech on the opening day of the General Assembly that he supported full discussion of the veto power issue, and even appropriate amendments. On the British side, Prime Minister Attlee and former Prime Minister Churchill also spoke out, advocating that the use of the veto power should be limited to conform to the democratic trend of the world. However, the Soviet side is taking firm steps, strongly supporting the veto power and fighting against its opponents. The Soviet Union has its own unavoidable difficulties in adopting this position, because the Soviet bloc is in the minority, whether in the 51-nation General Assembly or the 11-nation Security Council. Therefore, if all issues are voted on in a democratic way with a "majority vote," then the Soviet bloc will have no room to intervene in anything. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to abolish the veto power, and I am afraid it is not what the U.S. and Britain want. The only way seems to be to make appropriate interpretations and supplements to its use. This difficult problem has now been decided to be included in the agenda. We are sure to see a wonderful and fierce verbal battle.</p>

<h3>Movie Theaters to Donate Proceeds from Extra Morning Shows to Schools</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Film Industry Trade Association held a general meeting at the Majestic Theater yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to discuss celebrating Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 60th birthday and the entertainment tax issue. Representatives from 33 units in the film industry attended. The general meeting resolved to add an extra morning show at all movie theaters in the city on the morning of the 31st of this month, offering half-price tickets to all sectors of society. The proceeds from the ticket sales, after deducting the film rental fees and taxes, will be used to donate to schools.

In addition, lanterns and decorations will be hung at the entrances of all movie theaters to show celebration and express respect.</p>
<h3>Discussions in the Film Industry Regarding the Entertainment Tax: Should It Be Forty Percent?</h3>
<p>Regarding the results of discussions on the entertainment tax, it was decided to comply with the resolution of the Finance Committee of the Municipal Council, with the Finance Bureau handling the matter in accordance with the relevant resolution. The association will send representatives, including Executive Director Li Diyun, to the Finance Bureau to request an exemption from the 20% levy for the National Defense Corps' expenses. At the same time, according to the resolution of the Municipal Council, an additional 10% will be added. Therefore, based on the original 30% levy plus 10%, the total should be 40%.</p>
<p>A reporter interviewed Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, regarding this matter. According to Director Gu, the Municipal Council decided to increase the entertainment tax to 50%. The Finance Bureau has no authority to change the resolution of the Council. However, the Finance Committee of the Council resolved to have the Finance Bureau handle the matter at its discretion. The Finance Bureau will respect this opinion. Nevertheless, how to levy the tax in a way that resolves the demands of the film and theater industries and also allows the industry to convince the Council to pass it still requires a joint discussion with the Council to find a reasonable solution.</p>
<h3>Salt Loan Review Committee Resolves Two Major Cases</h3>

<h3>Eighty-Two-Year-Old Dr. Francis Pott Returns to China from the United States: "This is My Home; I Want to Live Here Forever Until I Die!"</h3>
<p>[Special Report by This Newspaper] Crack, crack, clap, clap! The sound of firecrackers echoed at the gate of St. John's University. This was to welcome Dr. Francis Pott, who is eighty-two years old. Professors, students, and staff members surged from different directions to welcome the old president! Two cars, carrying Dr. and Mrs. Pott and those who welcomed them, drove across the lawn of St. John's and stopped in front of the small Western-style house numbered 24.</p>
<p>This is a semi-new, semi-damaged small Western-style house. The second floor has bedrooms, and the ground floor has a living room, study, dining room, and kitchen. Dr. Pott spent more than fifty years in this exquisite residence. In 1941—the fourth year after the Lugouqiao Incident—Dr. Pott went to his hometown—the United States—originally hoping to return to China within six months, but the outbreak of the Pacific War destroyed all planned schedules. Dr. Pott could only temporarily reside in his hometown. However, this friend of China was always thinking about his second hometown!</p>
<p>Chinese Wife Died Early</p>
<p>During the five years that Dr. Pott was away, this small Western-style house was taken care of by a Mrs. Lin on his behalf. Mrs. Lin is Dr. Pott's niece—the niece of his Chinese wife. Dr. Pott has been married twice. His first wife was Chinese, but unfortunately, she died early. His current wife is British and is the same age as Dr. Pott. They came to China almost at the same time. The doctor has been in China for sixty years, and his wife for fifty-nine years. At that time, Mrs. Pott taught at St. Mary's Hall, and Dr. Pott served as the president of St. John's. Due to shared interests and environmental needs, they lived together, even though they were both already over fifty years old.</p>
<p>Three Sons and One Daughter Each Have a Profession</p>
<p>Dr. Pott has three sons and one daughter, all born to his Chinese wife. The eldest son is Professor James, who now teaches at St. John's and has given birth to a grandson for Dr. Pott, who is already eleven years old this year and studies at the American School on Route Petain. In addition, the two younger sons and a daughter are all in the United States. The second son is a principal, the youngest son is a doctor, and the daughter is a teacher. The current British wife's former husband's surname was Cooper, and he left behind a daughter, who is now over forty years old. Miss Cooper and Professor James never left Shanghai during the war. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, they were detained in concentration camps and moved from Yangzhou to Pudong, suffering greatly. After the victory, everyone was able to reunite in the United States. Professor James returned to St. John's two months ago, eager to be in China. Miss Cooper and Dr. and Mrs. Pott arrived in China at the same time the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Old Home Was Safe During the Occupation Period</p>
<p>For the sake of Miss Cooper, this old Western-style house almost suffered a raid. After Miss Cooper was detained in a concentration camp, Japanese military police visited the house, saying that they would seal the house and move the furniture away—fortunately, Mrs. Lin insisted that the house belonged to her, saying that Miss Cooper was just a guest. But the Japanese military police said, "Guests should also have their own belongings!" In this way, they took away a dressing table, wardrobe, and stool forcefully. Fortunately, the complete set of furniture and valuable antiques were safe!</p>
<p>Now, Dr. and Mrs. Pott have returned to their old home. This old Western-style house, semi-new furniture, Chinese paintings and antique porcelain adorning the walls, Western-style books on the bookshelves… everything is still the same as it was five years ago, so intimate and flavorful. So, Dr. Pott smiled, and more wrinkles appeared on his face.</p>
<p>He stepped into the study, sat in the armchair, and proudly said to the reporter, "I can speak Shanghainese, very good Shanghainese. I have even written a book telling foreigners how to learn Shanghainese. I also read Chinese newspapers, especially Shen Bao. Even in the United States, I often read Shen Bao!"</p>
<p>No Criticism of the Shen Siliang Case</p>
<p>When talking about St. John's University, he said, "It has changed. How can there be so many students?" "However," he continued, "this is an abnormal development after the war, and I firmly believe that it will soon return to normal."</p>
<p>Dr. Pott's mood during the conversation was always exceptionally pleasant, but when the reporter asked about his opinion on the former president, Shen Siliang, his face suddenly darkened. After a moment of silence, he said slowly, "I am not very willing to express my opinion on this matter because I am not very clear about this matter. Naturally, it is very unfortunate, and I am very sad." When asked if he would like to visit him, he said, "Even if I am willing, it is impossible because it is not allowed!"</p>
<p>Staying in China for a Long Time, Never Returning to the United States</p>
<p>"How long are you planning to stay in China this time?" Dr. Pott seemed not to believe his ears when he heard this sentence and immediately said, "Pardon!" When the reporter repeated it again, he seemed to think it was unnecessary for the reporter to ask this question. He said seriously, "This is my home. I want to live here forever until I die!"</p>
<p>When asked if he would be the president again, he said, "No, I'm too old."</p>
<p>"No, you're still very young!" the reporter replied. Indeed, Dr. Pott's every move did not resemble an eighty-two-year-old man at all. He is still young, and he will continue to work hard for education!</p>
<h3>The Secrets of the Shanghai Pickpocket Gang (7)</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>The performances of the above-mentioned various "trickery plays" are repeated day after day, knowing that they are illegal activities. Therefore, each group, in addition to the main actor, also assigns various duties to assist.</p>
<p>(A) "Mediator" - This is an accomplice disguised as a passerby, as a medium to lure people into the game, so it must be neatly dressed and eloquent. After placing a bet, they must win money repeatedly and get quick compensation, so that petty citizens, seeing the profit, will happily place a bet and be deceived.</p>
<p>(B) "Lookout" - This is like a sentry in the army, preventing sudden police attacks, so lookouts must be placed before and after the bridge frame.</p>
<p>(C) "Bribe-payer" - This kind of accomplice specializes in carrying bribes on the body. Once an arrest is made, if there is an opportunity to bribe, they must bribe so that they can be released on the spot.</p>
<p>"Everyone Uses Black-Hearted Money"</p>
<p>The "Pickpocket Gang" of old brothers believe that cleverly seizing and plundering is their way of life. Therefore, the brothers in the gang value friendship very much and do not value money. There is a slogan in the gang: "Everyone uses black-hearted money", which means that ill-gotten wealth should be shared. Therefore, the brothers in the gang can always "get a piece of the pie" every time they act. If the money received is not cash but stolen goods, it should be distributed in proportion after the sale. The rule is that the person who does the picking gets 40%, and the rest is distributed according to the effort made. Although the grades are different, they must not argue about the amount.</p>
<p>If the victim is a person in government or a close or distant relative of someone with power, after the theft, detectives will be dispatched, refusing to give up, and can also find out who caused the trouble based on the time and location of the incident and the activity route. The gang must then "return the jade intact." Therefore, everyone who has been involved in sharing the pie must "vomit the pickings," which means returning the money and goods they have obtained. This is what the gang considers "disappointing," but for the safety of the entire gang, they have to reluctantly part with it. Usually, the pickpockets' possessions must be kept for four days. If there is no dangerous rumor, they can be openly distributed. All the stolen goods obtained by pickpocketing are sold to a kind of "black shop" for very little money. Although they know that they are losing money, they have to get rid of it quickly for safety's sake, because this is also based on the gang's creed - the principle of "everyone uses black-hearted money."</p>
<h3>Mr. Frederick Maze, Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, Passes Away; Funeral to be Held at the International Cemetery This Morning; Successor Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Mr. Frederick Maze, Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs in this city, passed away at Hong En Hospital on Great West Road at 8:30 PM on the 25th. Mr. Maze was of British nationality and entered the Customs Service in 1913, the third year of the Republic of China. He was intelligent and capable and held important positions in the Customs Service. In 1941, the 30th year of the Republic of China, when the Pacific War broke out, he was imprisoned in a concentration camp by the enemy and suffered greatly, which greatly affected his health. After the victory, he returned to his country via transit. In June of this year, he was invited by our government to return to Shanghai and serve as the Commissioner of Customs. At the beginning of his appointment, due to excessive work intensity and failure to recover from the ordeal, he was hospitalized at Hong En Hospital due to illness, but he always tried his best to serve the public. According to a person in charge of the Jianghai Customs, Mr. Maze勉力 went to the Customs Office for a routine checkup as of the 14th of this month. From the 15th onward, his illness worsened drastically, and the doctor diagnosed him with heart and lung diseases, leading to his death the day before yesterday. He was 53 years old and had one son and one daughter. His only son died in the Great War. His wife arrived from England last week and was by his side. The remains have been moved to the International Funeral Home. Mr. Maze was a Catholic and the funeral will be held at the Catholic Church at 235 Rue Poussin this morning. At 10 o'clock, the remains will be transported to the International Cemetery on Jing'an Temple Road for burial.</p>
<p>Whether the successor to Mr. Maze after his death will be a foreigner or a Chinese is currently unknown, but it is reported that the Ministry of Finance is considering it. Also, during Mr. Maze's sick leave, his duties were performed by Permanent Customs Commissioner Liu Bingyi, so many believe that Mr. Liu may be a possible candidate. Mr. Liu served as Commissioner of Customs in Chongqing during the war and was sent to Dalian after the victory to take over the Dalian Customs, but it did not happen due to the special situation.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Rue du Consulat: One Fierce Robber Dies of Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] A robbery occurred at the Dajiangnan Shoe Store at the intersection of Rue du Consulat and Chengdu Road at 9:30 PM the night before last. After the brave pursuit and capture by the police officers of the Xincheng Precinct, five robbers were captured after a four-hour period. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Afterwards, it was learned that there were a total of six fierce robbers at the time of the robbery.) One robber escaped by climbing the roof and disappeared. The six robbers possessed one submachine gun, one Mauser pistol, and one six-inch pistol. On the spot, the police seized one pistol and one submachine gun from two robbers. The next morning, around 5:00 AM, Chief Zhuo led the police to find a Mauser pistol left behind by the robbers on the wall of a lane in Chengdu Road and brought it back to the station for safekeeping. It was also learned that one of the robbers, Zhang Huilong, also known as Xiao Pudong, who committed suicide for fear of punishment, died yesterday morning after four hours of rescue efforts. The remaining four captured robbers, Shi Tingshan and others, were interrogated by the Che Precinct. According to their confessions, they had committed 21 robberies before. Yesterday morning, a stolen radio was also retrieved. Because the suspects have committed many crimes and the investigation is time-consuming, the Xincheng Police Precinct applied for a 20-day detention period to conduct the interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Bronze Statue of Li Ping Shu is Erected in Memory of His Lasting Influence on Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The unveiling ceremony of the bronze statue of Mr. Li Tongmin (i.e., Li Pingshu) was solemnly held at Huxin Pavilion in the Chenghuang Temple in Nanshi at 10:00 AM yesterday. The entrance of the Chenghuang Temple was decorated with a colorful archway, and the bronze statue was erected in the lotus pond of Huxin Pavilion in the Chenghuang Temple. At the entrance of Huxin Pavilion, there was a horizontal plaque inscribed with the words "Benefit Universal to Shanghai" by President Jiang, and on the wall in the center of the pavilion, there was a horizontal plaque inscribed with the words "Virtue Covers the Shanghai Area" by Mayor Wu.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM, firecrackers exploded in unison on the Nine-Turn Bridge, and the Boy Scout band played melodious music. The unveiling ceremony of the bronze statue began on time. Mayor Wu presided over the ceremony. In his speech, the Mayor said: "I am deeply moved to participate in the unveiling ceremony of Mr. Li Pingshu today. There is an ancient saying in China: 'The highest is to establish virtue, the second is to establish merit.' The so-called merit is definitely not about being a high-ranking official, nor is it about being famous. Merit is about truly serving the people." "In this world, there are countless people who have higher positions and greater fame than Mr. Li, but there are very few who can be eternally remembered by the local people like Mr. Li. From this example, we have come to the conclusion that no matter what undertaking, as long as it truly serves the people, it will be loved," Mayor Wu said. "Nanshi is our own Chinese, and we must actively repair it no matter what. The renovation of roads and the repair of wharfs are all in the planning stage. If all the wharfs are completed and put into use, I firmly believe that it can be restored within three years." Mayor Wu's speech ended with applause. Fang Zhi (representing Xie Dahuang), Director of the Municipal Party Department, and Qian Xinzhi then delivered speeches. After Li Xiangfu, the grandson of Li Pingshu, gave a thank you speech, the ceremony ended.</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Will Focus on Post-Disaster Work - A Grand Tea Party Was Held Yesterday - Appealing to All Sectors for Assistance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Huo Baoshu, Director of the Executive Yuan, Li Zhuo, Deputy Director, and Liu Hongsheng, Executive Director, held a grand tea party at the Bank of China on the fourth floor yesterday afternoon to entertain all sectors of the city and appeal for assistance in promoting the work of the Executive Yuan. Mayor Wu, Kong Xiangxi, General Egerton, representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in China, Cheng Zhonghang, Xu Jilun, Fang Zhi, Liu Gongyun, Zhao Zukang, Gu Chunfan, Li Ximou, Xi Yushu, and worker Lin and other Chinese and foreign guests, about 150 people, attended.</p>
<p>Director Huo first gave a speech, briefly stating: In the past year, the Executive Yuan has encountered many difficulties, but there are also many shortcomings in its own work, which it hopes to gradually improve in the future. It will strive for fairness in the distribution of materials. In the future, the work of the Executive Yuan will focus on post-disaster relief, such as industrial and mining equipment, which will be shipped in succession. It is necessary for the financial and transportation sectors to provide more assistance, and it is hoped that local officials will provide as much convenience and cooperation as possible. At the same time, he expressed his gratitude and pleasure for the cooperation and assistance of General Egerton.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Kong Xiangxi reported on his negotiations for relief supplies in the United States, and said that we should not arbitrarily criticize UNRRA materials, and should take into account the goodwill of the donors. He hoped that the Executive Yuan's post-disaster relief work should not be passive relief, but should pay attention to constructive relief.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Explains Three Points</p>
<p>Then, Mayor Wu explained three points: (1) The local government also regrets that the Executive Yuan's relief work is not perfect, and will try its best to assist in the future. (2) The municipal government has decided to carry out winter relief this year, and hopes that UNRRA and the Executive Yuan can also provide assistance. (3) UNRRA and the Executive Yuan hope that the year will end soon, and the government will continue to carry out this work, and at the same time, it still hopes that local people will jointly maintain it.</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu's speech, Inspector Cheng Zhonghang gave a speech. He believed that according to his personal investigation, there were three reasons why the work of the Executive Yuan could not be satisfactory: (1) domestic instability, (2) financial problems, and (3) problems on the government side. He also believed that both Jiang and Huo had made their best efforts, and wished the work of the Executive Yuan would become better and better. Finally, Edward, director of the United China Relief Association, General Egerton, and Chairman Fang, among others, gave speeches one after another, and the event ended happily at around 6:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Liu Quan and Li Chunrong Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>

<h3>Thirty Million Yuan Check Case - Jia Youliang Wins Appeal</h3>
<p>The case of football star Jia Youliang being accused of issuing checks for 30 million yuan was previously ruled by the District Court to be repaid in full. Since this matter was to take the blame for others, he appealed to the High Court. The court heard the case yesterday, and Judge Zhang believed that the original judgment was inconsistent with the facts, so he ruled Jia Youliang not guilty in court, and the appeal of the people was also rejected.</p>
<h3>Rationing of American Wool Military Blankets for Public Educators</h3>

In addition, a small number of people have not yet picked up the sugar rationed for the second time. The pick-up procedures will also be carried out at 355 Zhabu Road on the 28th and 29th.

<h3>Land Return Embezzlement Case - District Prosecutor's Office Begins Investigation - All Three Defendants Failed to Appear Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Gaoqiao District land administration embezzlement case, which was questioned by Councillors Tao Baichuan and others at the first session of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was launched for investigation yesterday morning by the District Prosecutor's Office after summoning the victims. Back in 1940, during the period of Shanghai's fall, an enemy-organized Hengchan Company, under the order of the enemy military headquarters, forcibly requisitioned 693 mu, 3 fen, 4 li, and 8 hao of civilian land along the riverbank in the Gaoqiao District of Pudong. After the victory, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, at the request of the people of the district, returned the land to the respective owners, and decided to recover 20,000 yuan per mu. At that time, a man named Zhou Songqian, who had served as a Baozhang during the enemy puppet period, was quite powerful in the local area, and claimed to be a representative of the people, contacted the Land Administration Bureau to handle the return of the land, and took the opportunity to defraud the villagers. The Land Administration Bureau originally decided to recover only 20,000 yuan per mu for the returned land, but Zhou actually charged an extra 80,000 yuan. All 106 victimized owners were fooled, and the total amount of fraud reached tens of millions of yuan. After the matter was reported, the Land Administration Bureau immediately conducted a thorough investigation. Zhang Jiliang, the head of the responsible section, and Huang Qiren, a clerk, were suspected of colluding with the embezzlement of their duties. They were dismissed and released on bail by the Land Administration Bureau, and the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Yesterday, the District Prosecutor's Office conducted its first investigation, and only 15 victimized villagers arrived. The defendants Zhou Songqian, Zhang Jiliang, and Huang Qiren all failed to appear. It is said that the inside story of the case is complicated and involves a wide range of people. Chen Shiquan, the former director of the Land Administration Bureau, may also be summoned for questioning when necessary.</p>
<h3>French Ship Resumes Far East Route - "Song Dan" Delayed Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Return to France After Repairs in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The French ship "Song Dan," with a load of more than 8,000 tons, which is the first French ship to resume the Far East route after the war, suffered damage to its machinery near Singapore. It was repaired briefly in Singapore and then sailed to Saigon. After a brief stay, it sailed to Hong Kong. It came north from Hong Kong on Thursday and was expected to arrive today. However, because the ship was not thoroughly repaired in Singapore, its sailing is still slow. It is feared that it will not be able to arrive in port today, and will have to be postponed until 6:00 pm next Monday to the Wusongkou, and enter the port on the 29th. It is scheduled to dock at the Huangpu Wharf. The ship is carrying 1,048 passengers to Shanghai this time, of which more than 500 are from Hong Kong, and more than 30,260 pieces of cargo, mostly steel and hardware, 45 pieces of mail, and more than 200 pieces of luggage. After arriving in Shanghai, it needs to be repaired again, which will delay it for at least two weeks, so the date of its return to France has not yet been determined. The second "Andelaipeng" postal ship has already departed from France and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on November 22.</p>
<p>"Hai Xiang" Ship Sails to Okinawa</p>
<p>The "Red Glove" ship, represented by the American President Lines, will be imported today. The China Merchants Bureau's B-type ship "Hai Jun" has unloaded its cargo and is scheduled to move from the railway wharf to the Jinliyuan No. 12 buoy today to receive it on schedule.

<h3>Peng Zhaoxian Inspects Police Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Peng Zhaoxian, the director of the Ministry of Interior Affairs, came to Shanghai a few days ago to inspect Shanghai's police administration and self-government institutions. After visiting Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan, he was accompanied by Deputy Director Yu of the Police Bureau to inspect the Police Bureau at 10:30 yesterday morning.

<h3>Police Nitpicking - Butchers Request Correction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated that when slaughtered cattle in the city are transported from the slaughterhouse to the designated vegetable market in trucks, they are often arbitrarily accused by the police on duty of exceeding the limited weight of five tons, and are stopped from passing, or even ordered to drive the entire vehicle and goods into the reweighing station. As a result, there is no overweight issue, but the butchers suffer great losses due to the delay in time and the spoilage of the meat. They have specially requested the Police Bureau to correct this.</p>
<h3>Animal Husbandry Experiment Station Occupies Civilian Farmland - Supervisory Office Urges Relocation and Return</h3>
<p>In the Xiajiatang area of Jiangwan, farmers Liu Xikun and others have more than 40 mu of farmland, which they cultivate for a living. After the fall of Shanghai, their land was forcibly occupied by the Japanese to build a military lumber mill. At that time, Liu's father was frightened to death, his wife was brutally killed, and his eldest son was hacked, causing his family to be destroyed and scattered. After the victory, Liu and others returned. In April of this year, they submitted documents and applied to the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau to return the base. After investigation, the Disposal Bureau approved the application and sent a letter to the Central Trust Bureau to take over the enemy-built wooden houses on the land. Unexpectedly, all eight wooden houses were used by the Shanghai Animal Husbandry Experiment Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The station claimed that it was allocated by the Shanghai Economic Experiment Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and refused to hand them over, nor did it sign a custody receipt. The Experiment Farm also claimed that it was ordered by the Ministry to take over the farm and had no right to decide, resulting in the Central Trust Bureau being unable to take over. As for Liu Xikun and others, they repeatedly requested the Animal Husbandry Experiment Station to return the base, but the station's attitude was always unreasonable and they had no intention of relocating. The hope of regaining their old business was lost, and the prospect of freezing and starvation was worrying. They specially appealed to the Jiangsu Supervisory Office for a thorough investigation. It is reported that after the office sent personnel to investigate, it has sent a letter to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, ordering the Central Animal Husbandry Experiment Station to relocate the base as soon as possible in order to respect the property rights of the owners. The enemy-built wooden houses on the land should be handed over to the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau and the Central Trust Bureau for takeover and disposal.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Wharf Dispute - Social Bureau Agrees to Re-Arbitrate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Zhabei Wharf Trade Union and the Rice Cart Carrying Trade Union had a dispute over business in the past, which was arbitrated by the Social Bureau, and the work was assigned to the Rice Cart Carrying Trade Union. After the wharf workers lost their jobs, they gathered more than 200 people at around 10:00 yesterday morning to obstruct the rice cart carrying workers from carrying rice on the rice boats. The Zhabei Sub-bureau immediately dispatched a large number of long-serving police officers to suppress the incident and ordered them to disperse. However, the wharf coolies refused due to livelihood concerns. The police arrested more than 30 radical elements and took them to the bureau for investigation. Upon receiving the news, the Social Bureau immediately sent Liu Mingqing to discuss the matter with Huang Baisheng and two other representatives of the Wharf Trade Union. Liu agreed to Huang that he would send representatives to the bureau on Monday to apply for re-arbitration by the Social Bureau. As for the more than 30 coolies who were arrested, Liu accompanied the representatives to the sub-bureau to bail them out.</p>

<p>Chen Ping asked a friend, Mr. A, who has been married to a woman, Miss B, for several years and has children. Initially, their relationship was quite harmonious, but later B abandoned her previous lover and cohabited with Mr. C. However, she had previously used the name of "dual inheritance" and with the consent of A, B, and both parents, and had B allocate real estate to A for living expenses. It has been more than a year now, and A intends to overturn the previous agreement. There are several questions that need to be answered: (1) If A sues in court, will he be bound by the previous agreement? (2) Can the previous agreement be overturned?

In 1942, the parents decided to divide the property equally between A and B, except for a portion reserved for retirement expenses. A property division agreement was drawn up, with each brother holding one copy, stating that all the property under the parents' names was to be managed by the biological son, B, and had nothing to do with the eldest son.

<h3>Inquiring About Matters Concerning the Review and Approval of Graduates from Puppet Provincial Middle Schools</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I am a graduate of the former puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Nanhua Middle School." I was admitted to National Fudan University in July 1945. I read in your newspaper's education news that the Provincial Department of Education has extended the review and approval matters to the end of this month, but I don't know the procedures. I have always admired your column for its aim of serving society, so I specially wrote this letter to ask for your guidance. I am extremely grateful. With best wishes, Reader Ma Tianyuan.</p>
<p>[Answer] Since graduates of puppet middle schools were admitted to national universities last year, the university should submit a request to the Ministry of Education for approval. As for the review and approval procedures of the Jiangsu Department of Education, you can directly inquire with the department in Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3>New Glass Factory Recruiting Apprentices</h3>
<p>A new industrial glass manufacturing factory plans to recruit dozens of apprentices, limited to males, with elementary school education, aged between 14 and 17 years old, and with a guarantor. Applicants should submit their applications to the Far East Glass Factory on Qingyun Road, Zhabei before October 30. If the review is successful, they will be notified to enter the factory for learning.</p>
<h3>Post-War Factory Reestablishment Association - Taking Over Enemy and Puppet Factories - Many Difficulties Ahead - Property Rights Disputes, Machines are Damaged, Financial Support from the Government is Needed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Although the 24 factories purchased or leased by the Post-War Factory Reestablishment Association have been reviewed and approved by the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau, the association has not yet been notified to take over them. From takeover to commencement of work, there are still many difficulties to overcome. First of all, many of these factories have property rights disputes. Especially during the enemy and puppet occupation period, all sales and purchase acts can be used today with the reason of "forced sale" to demand the return of the original property. The witnesses and material evidence between "forced sale" and voluntary transaction are all problematic. Secondly, this batch of factories were not sold at past auctions by the Enemy and Puppet Disposal Bureau. The internal machines are severely damaged. It takes time and money to add finishing touches. According to the estimates of relevant people, the start of work varies according to the nature of each factory, with a minimum of two or three months and a maximum of half a year. The supply of electricity is also a major problem, which will only be solved after the city's power generation increases in two months. Also, those who take over this batch of factories are all small and medium-sized factories in the rear, with limited financial resources. After this journey of relocation, they have spent a lot of money. In the future, when they resume work, they still need the government to provide financial support.</p>
<p>Puppet Division Commander Xie Wenda - High Court Issues Arrest Warrant</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Xie Wenda, the puppet military division commander who led his troops to be stationed in Ningbo during the enemy and puppet period, relied on his evil power to levy taxes and extort money, poisoning the local area. The villagers hated him to the bone. After the victory, the villagers filed a complaint with the Shanghai High Procuratorate to severely punish him, but Xie had already fled and disappeared without a trace. In addition to filing a public prosecution on the case, the High Procuratorate also issued an order yesterday to put Xie Wenda on the wanted list, requesting the District Procuratorate and all relevant parties to arrest him and bring him to justice.

<h3>Converted Rickshaw Tricycle - First One Costs 600,000</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Chen Zhiyao, chairman of the Shanghai Rickshaw Business Association, told reporters yesterday that since the municipal government ordered the rickshaws in the city to stop running and only allow tricycles to run, the association used the original rickshaw bodies to convert them into tricycles for single-person riding, because all the rickshaws will be discarded. The first one has been converted and completed, costing a total of 600,000 yuan. Yesterday, Chen sent the first converted tricycle to the Bureau of Public Utilities for inspection. The Bureau of Public Utilities instructed to submit drawings for verification. It is reported that the bureau has now designed another type of tricycle, but the drawings will not be fully completed in four or five days. The bureau will compare these two types of drawings and check whether they are safe before deciding whether to allow them to run.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Visiting Bai Jiao's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition: Returning to Simplicity After Splendor, Melancholy and Indignation Overflowing from the Words</h3>
<p>[Special Report by This Newspaper] People say that Mr. Bai Jiao, a native of Zhenjian, is excellent in calligraphy, painting, and seal carving. However, after visiting his recent calligraphy and painting exhibition at the Ningbo Native Place Association yesterday, I felt that Mr. Bai Jiao's alternative names were also good, and his poems were even better. Why? I would answer that Mr. Bai Jiao is a person of genuine emotions. Although he wanted to hide himself with madness, he could not conceal his enthusiasm everywhere. Although he was unwilling to say much about national affairs, look at the kind of ecstasy he showed when he heard that the enemy had surrendered! And for his children, in the three long poems "Remember Ah Hong, Ah Yi, Ah Lian," he was even more deeply affectionate, and he simply perfected the plain style of writing poems!</p>
<p>As early as around 1927, I knew of Mr. Bai Jiao, although he probably did not use the name "Bai Jiao" much at that time. At that time, his heroic spirit was overwhelming, and his blood was boiling. In the past ten years or so, it has been suppressed and become pieces of orchid petals. Even Bai Jiao talks about Zen now! After the extreme of splendor, he has gradually returned to simplicity, but his melancholy and indignation still flow between the lines everywhere. He is still condemning; when monsters and freaks were running rampant, he said, "If I don't see France, the old man will die like Pétain!" It's a pity that he didn't know at the time that Pétain hadn't died.</p>
<p>Bai Jiao paints orchids and bamboos, but not pine and cypress, so even large central scrolls have the atmosphere of small pieces. Bai Jiao writes characters with the brush used for painting orchids and bamboos, and the delicate beauty is compelling. But it is precisely because he does not paint pine and cypress that the vigorousness is inevitably flawed. In couplets, there are often cases where every character is good, but there is only one bad stroke, which makes people sigh endlessly. The characters also have the atmosphere of small pieces, so the square inch regular script is the most wonderful, and the cursive script shows shortness of breath. However, writing long inscriptions in small characters really has the atmosphere of the Jin people.</p>
<p>Bai Jiao's theory of calligraphy is that Zhao's characters are like prostitutes and Dong's characters are not chaste women, which is naturally quite reasonable. However, Bai Jiao's characters are still ultimately orchids, not pine and cypress. There are really too few materials for the pillars of China.</p>
<p>Bai Jiao is an expert in researching Yuan Shikai. The historical materials of the Hongxian period that he continuously published in the "Renwen" magazine in those years were very precious. People today do not talk about Yuan Shikai; if they do, all the references come from this. In recent years, I don't know what this "　Wang" has been doing? In a small screen, he wrote a passage from Zhuge Wuhou's letter, and in the postscript, he said that the original letter belonged to Yuan Hanyun, but he used "Yuan Shikai stole the country" as the beginning, which was written magnificently! However, Bai Jiao's楹聯 (楹聯 - couplets written on scrolls) have gradually contained more loyal and honest words in recent years. The 聯 (聯 - couplets) collected from Song lyrics that he used to write are almost impossible to see again. It would be better if he could "seek clumsiness" again, and it would be best if he could make "clumsiness" not "sought."</p>

<h3>Detailed Measures for the Third Phase of Yarn Allocation Have Been Drafted, the Cotton Spinning Industry Has Also Set Up Three Small Group Meetings, and the Schedule of Yarn Allocation and Price Negotiation Tables Have Been Announced</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The price negotiation for the third phase of cotton yarn allocation was decided at a meeting convened by Chairman Wu of the Textile Control Commission on the 23rd of this month. The negotiated price for 20-count cotton yarn is 1.75 million yuan. According to Liu Wen, Director of the Business Department of the Commission, to the reporter: The other counts of yarn have also been calculated proportionally and have been sent to the Spinning Construction Company and the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association for its members to check. The negotiated prices for each count of cotton yarn are as follows: 20 count, 1.75 million yuan; 10 count, 1.53 million yuan; 12 count, 1.58 million yuan; 16 count, 1.62 million yuan; 32 count, 2.32 million yuan; 32 count double strand, 2.61 million yuan; 40 count, 2.77 million yuan; 42 count, 2.77 million yuan; 42 count double strand, 2.79 million yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association convened a general meeting of members a few days ago. In addition to deciding on the allocation of yarn for each yarn factory and drafting six simple rules for the third phase of yarn allocation, it also formed three committees for raw materials, price negotiation, and distribution. The list of members of each committee: Raw Materials Committee: Dong Yunzhang, Rong Yixin, Dong Chunfang, Huang Shoumin, Liu Piji. Price Negotiation Committee: Wang Qiyu, Wu Kunsheng, Jiang Dixian, Guo Dihuo, Cheng Jingtang, Tang Xinghai. Distribution Committee: Wu Weijing, Liu Jingji, Tong Runfu, Gu Dingji, Guo Qiong, Cheng Runsheng.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Price Negotiation Committee convened a special meeting to discuss and approve a price negotiation table for each count of cotton yarn, which was reported to the Textile Control Commission for approval (price negotiation see above). In addition to sending the price negotiation table to each member for verification, the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association also sent another letter stating: It is understood that the authorities are determined to eliminate the black market and suppress yarn prices in this distribution of cotton yarn. Each factory must cooperate fully and conduct its own inspections. For the remaining amount of yarn outside of the distributed yarn, each factory must strictly abide by the negotiated price when selling it, which is what we hope for.</p>
<p>A total of 36 private factories are allocating yarn in the third phase. The allocation is based on the actual number of spindles opened by each factory in July, with 20-count yarn as the standard. If each factory sells other counts, it will be calculated according to the following ratios: 10 count, 187.5%; 16 count, 125%; 20 count, 100%; 32 count, 75%; 42 count, 60%. It is found that the total amount of yarn to be allocated by each private factory is 8,003 pieces, which will be allocated in two batches. The first batch should be 4,002 pieces, and the second batch should be 4,001 pieces. The total amount of yarn allocated to each factory is led by Shenxin No. 9 Factory with 980 pieces. Second is Shenxin No. 2 Factory with 480 pieces, and third is Tongyi Yarn Factory with 444 pieces. After that are Shenxin No. 1 Factory with 375 pieces, Shenxin No. 6 Factory with 373 pieces, Yong'an No. 3 and No. 4 Factories, each with 357 pieces, Xin Yu No. 2 Factory with 330 pieces, and Xinhe Yarn Factory with 305 pieces. The least is He Feng and Qin Feng Yarn Factories, each with 36 pieces.</p>
<p>Simple Rules for the Third Phase of Cotton Yarn Allocation</p>
<p>(1) The total amount of yarn allocated this time is 12,004.5 pieces, of which state-owned factories account for one-third, which is 4,001.5 pieces, and private factories account for two-thirds, which is 8,003 pieces (the amount of yarn allocated to each private factory is listed in a separate allocation table). (2) Each factory will allocate the yarn in two batches according to the allocation table (i.e., Monday, October 28 and Monday, November 4). Every Monday, each factory shall prepare a form listing the counts, trademarks, and prices of each type of cotton yarn and submit it to the association. (3) Each factory shall calculate the yarn price based on 1.75 million yuan per piece for 20 count yarn as the standard. (4) When each factory submits the yarn allocation form, it shall also submit the reservation forms for various cotton yarns (this reservation form is for customers to exchange the warehouse receipt for the price paid to the factory with the reservation form. Five pieces per sheet for 20 count yarn, one piece per sheet for yarn above 20 count) together to the association. (5) The association will submit the yarn allocation table of each factory to the "Reproduction Association Joint Office" (the joint office jointly established by the six reproduction associations, hereinafter referred to as the Joint Office) on Monday afternoon. The Joint Office will allocate the members and customers according to the distribution, and create a table listing the name of the yarn purchaser, the factory purchased from, the count and type of cotton yarn purchased, and its price, and submit it to the association by Wednesday. The association will issue the reservation forms based on the table. (6) The Joint Office will distribute the reservation forms to customers upon receipt. Customers are limited to exchange the reservation forms and prepare the payment to the factory for the warehouse receipt on Thursday and clear the yarn within ten days.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Stabilize</h3>
<p>The public price situation is mediocre, the demand and supply are still scattered, the Silk Industry Bank has made slight progress, the process is stable, and the turnover has reached 5 million yuan. Tongbing opened at 2020 yuan, and once rose to around 2090 yuan. Finally, it still hovered around 2050 yuan. As a result, it closed slightly higher than the previous day by 20 yuan, Yiyou was down slightly by 20 yuan, Dingzhong was flat, and Wuzhong was down slightly by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Standards Determined, 77 Points Listed as Grade D</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The joint meeting of relevant agencies the other day has made a decision on the grade issue of raw silk purchased. In the future, the export of raw silk will be based on the standards of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and 77 points will be listed as Grade D. This standard is the same as Japan's and one point lower than the United States'. However, according to silk industry experts, the inspection standards of the Commodity Inspection Bureau are quite high. Those listed as Grade D in our country may be upgraded abroad. There have been many such cases in the past. This decision has fully taken into account the interests of producers.</p>
<h3>This Port's Raw Silk Exports Valued at 24 Billion This Year</h3>
<p>Raw silk exports occupy an important position in our country's exports. According to statistics obtained from relevant parties, Shanghai's raw silk exports in September totaled 92.784 kilograms, valued at 3,435,149,000 yuan, accounting for 14% of the total export value.

<h3>President Song Receives Wang Zhixin, the Possibility of Starting Cash Settlement and U.S. Dollar Bonds is Discussed</h3>
<p>After flying directly to Shanghai from Taiwan the day before yesterday afternoon, Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen received Bei Zuyi, Governor of the Central Bank, and inquired about the recent financial situation in Shanghai. Yesterday, he also received Wang Zhixin, General Manager of the Stock Exchange. Wang reported in detail the sluggish trading situation since the opening of the exchange. Wang also made inquiries about the issue of opening cash settlement futures and listing U.S. dollar bonds. It is said that the stock exchange's sluggish phenomenon may improve once cash settlement futures are started.</p>
<h3>Extramural Influence Intramural... Bulls Buy Up Yong Yarn</h3>
<p>Yesterday, several bullish companies launched an offensive in the Hua stock market, buying Yong Yarn heavily extramurally. Intramurally, they first sold and then bought, gradually recovering after weakness. At the morning opening, each stock showed slight prosperity, but soon No. 104 came to sell forcefully, and Yong Yarn took the lead in retreating slightly, and each stock followed suit. The new low price was created by Jingfu. However, the news that the bullish company was aggressively entering extramurally had spread throughout the intramural, and people's hearts became optimistic, and the market recovered repeatedly. After 11:30, the bullish company made every effort to transfer the chips released in the intramural at high prices. As a result, Yong Yarn rose to a high price of 753 yuan, and Xinhe was also brought up, while the rest were relatively stable. Near noon, the bulls and bears fought fiercely, rising and falling suddenly, and struggling fiercely. Qinxing also took the opportunity to end at a high price, while the rest of the stocks were just so-so. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the hot stocks Yong Yarn, Mei Ya, Qinxing, and Xinhe each rose by about 4%. Jingfu and Xinguang each reported a small increase. Among the cold stocks, Zhongfang Datong and Matches rose by half a percent. Xinya rose by one percent alone. Underwear Huafeng Company Cement Wuhe rose slightly. Zhongsitongyi was flat. Rongfeng Luan was slightly lower. The total turnover was 9.16 million shares. Most of the extramural stocks were stable.</p>

<h3>Machinery Mortgages Are Difficult to Implement</h3>
<p>Still Emphasizing Raw Materials and Finished Products</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Since the Four Joint Offices issued the mortgage loan measures, there have been some improvements on the whole, but the reporter learned from relevant parties that the collateral is still based on raw materials and finished products. Because there are too many problems with machinery mortgages; first, the performance and types of machines are extremely complicated and cannot be identified without experts; second, machines have the problem of depreciation. The so-called depreciation can be divided into two categories: one is the consumption caused by the use of machines, and the other is the elimination of old-fashioned machines due to the invention and use of new weapons machines; these are all issues that should be considered when handling mortgages. As for the date of implementation of the new measures, the Shanghai branch has not heard of it.</p>
<p>Bao Shu, Director of the Loan Group Committee of the Four Joint Offices, has taken office as Director of the Executive Yuan Headquarters and is unable to take care of both. He has firmly requested to resign. The headquarters has now appointed Lin Fengbao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, as the concurrent post. The group meeting on the 26th will be chaired by Lin.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Shows Slight Firmness in Fine Counts and Flatness in Coarse Counts, with the Greatest Fluctuations in Double Strands</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was slightly firm in fine counts and flat in coarse counts. Customer sales were still not enthusiastic, and people's hearts were also very mediocre. The fluctuations in 42-count double-strand thread were extremely large. At the beginning, there were rumors that the Textile Control Commission would allocate 6,000 pieces to practical manufacturers next Monday, and the yarn merchants sold at lower prices due to false rumors. For example, 42-count Blue Phoenix once fell to 2.33 million yuan. Then, there were many people buying at low prices, and the price rose slowly. The closing price rebounded to 3.5 million yuan, which was 100,000 yuan higher than yesterday. 20-count yarn was only up by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and 16-count yarn was as sluggish as ever, and the price was down slightly by 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Has Substitutes, Sweetness is 4,000 Times Higher</h3>
<p>[United Press Chicago, 25th] Professor Bierde of Denver University revealed today that he has invented a sugar substitute that is 4,000 times sweeter than sucrose, and the Netherlands is currently starting production. He said that this product is extracted from asphalt and is 10 to 20 times sweeter than saccharin.</p>
<h3>Relaxed Monetary Policy and Gold Prices Rise... Foreign Currencies Also Became Popular</h3>
<p>Huochi continued to rise yesterday. It opened at 2.267 million in the morning, and after opening, it gradually recovered from 2.265 million. Although the supply was available, it was not smooth. After 10:00, the Central Bank allocated 101 bars at a price of 2.2775 million. Due to the Saturday relationship, people's hearts were quite strong, and the monetary policy was even more rampant. Demand exceeded supply, and it continued to rise. Near noon, it once rose to a high price of 2.29 million, and then stabilized slightly. At noon, it hovered around 2.285 million. In the afternoon, there were fewer transactions on Saturday, and the market price was flat. As a result, it closed up 23,000 yuan more than the previous closing. Jewelry shops hung gold ornaments at 242,000 yuan. There were no changes in silver taels and silver dollars. The informal discount rate was still very loose, and the interest rate ranged from 12 to 15 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies followed the gold market and became popular. The informal market for U.S. dollars rose from 4,150 yuan to around 4,200 yuan, slightly higher than the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were slightly prosperous due to the stimulation of the decline in the telegraphic transfer of the Hong Kong market, struggling around 900 yuan. As a result, it closed up 5 yuan more than the previous closing. Hong Kong telegraphic transfer rose to 900 yuan to 910 yuan, Indian exchange rate was 1075 yuan to 1085 yuan, British exchange rate was 14250 yuan to 14450 yuan, and the official exchange rate of U.S. dollars was flat and trading was quiet.</p>
<h3>Wartime Public Debt Custody Committee Exchanges Construction U.S. Dollar Bonds</h3>

Purchasing households can go to the committee to negotiate the receipt.</p>
<h3>Joint Operating Office Temporarily Suspends Allocation, Anthracite Suddenly Turns Tight</h3>
<p>Regarding coal, because the Coal Business Joint Operating Office received a notice from the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs that it would temporarily suspend the allocation of various goods, rumors in the market were rife, and the market situation suddenly turned tight. One rumor was that the Fuel Management Committee would adjust the allocation of goods next month, so the allocation was temporarily suspended. Another rumor was that the Fuel Management Committee was organizing the coal inventory accounts and would resume the distribution as usual next Monday. White coal, Jiaozuo, and Xin Hongji still maintained the original price. Yangquan was calling for a high price of 1.1 million yuan per ton, and there were no sellers.</p>
<h3>Shipping Freight Rates Not Allowed to Increase, Passenger Ticket Prices Allowed to Increase Separately, South Seas Routes and Shenhan Section Not Adjusted</h3>

<h3>After the Price Controls Are Lifted, the United States Prevents the Outflow of Materials</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] Due to the cancellation of price controls, the United States may take some control measures on the export of goods to prevent large-scale outflow.

Yesterday, Wang Yutai Tea Company opened the market, and a total of 95 cases were traded at a price of 140,000 yuan per load, which was sold by Shenyuan Tea Company. Other varieties are still only touched by local shops, and foreign firms are all showing weakness. As for the foreign tea market, high-grade black tea is unusually active under the strong search of British firms, and the market continues to show its sharpness. Chen tea, however, is deteriorating due to the full of moldy smell.</p>
<h3>Shipping Group Economic Transport Office Undertakes Executive Yuan Water Transport</h3>
<p>The China Shipping Economic Transport Office is formed by collecting shipping companies from all over the country. The fund is tentatively set at 600 million yuan, of which one-third is subscribed by the state-owned China Merchants Bureau, and the remaining two-thirds of the shares are freely subscribed by various shipping companies.

<h3>U.S. Cotton Crop Failure, At Most 8.2 Million Bales, World Consumption Increases</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 25th] Texas Agriculture Commissioner McDonald predicts that this year's cotton harvest will be one of the smallest since 1888. If the weather is good during the flowering season, it is hoped to harvest 8.2 million bales. McDonald said that the Department of Agriculture has requested to plant 24 million acres of cotton in the coming season, but to get this number, cotton prices must be maintained at least at the level of 40 cents per pound.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's recently published "Cotton Supply Overview," the world supply of commercial cotton for this year is estimated at 42 million bales, 7 million bales less than the highest record in 1939, and 5 million bales less than the average supply from 1935 to 1939. But this year's consumption may increase by 19% compared to last year.</p>
<h3>High Costs and Merchant Hesitation: The Decline of the Peppermint Oil Business, Farmers Face Losses Selling Oil</h3>
<p>According to insiders in the peppermint industry, the golden age of China's peppermint business was between the 26th and 30th years of the Republic [1937-1941]. It is said that only China and Japan produced peppermint in the world. During that period, China's labor costs were lower than Japan's, and the quality of its products was far superior. Therefore, exports flourished. The annual export volume of menthol exceeded two million pounds. At that time, the export price was about US$9 to US$10 per pound, and the purchase price of peppermint crude oil was about the price of one dan [a unit of dry measure] of rice per jin [unit of weight]. Farmers were happy to plant and refine oil because of the high profits, resulting in a remarkably abundant yield. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, foreign ships stopped coming to China, and the export of peppermint oil came to a halt. As a result, market prices plummeted. Farmers stopped planting one after another. However, domestic stocks were still relatively abundant, and the supply was not felt to be scarce. Especially after the war, various small and medium-sized new pharmaceutical factories, toothpaste factories, and tooth powder factories were established, so the sales channels became more active, and the annual sales volume gradually increased to more than 30,000 pounds. After the victory, with the hope of restoring exports, manufacturers launched activities to purchase crude oil from various producing areas, and farmers in various producing areas also began planting silk cocoons. Unexpectedly, the market price of peppermint crude oil was only more than 10,000 yuan per jin, while the fuel required by farmers to refine crude oil now costs 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per jin, and labor costs also require more than 3,000 yuan. The price that merchants or manufacturers can pay to farmers is only about 10,000 yuan per jin. Therefore, farmers who produce oil end up losing money, and merchants are unwilling to transport it because there is no profit to be made. Therefore, the lotus industry, which had just begun to rise, has suffered a setback and is on the verge of death.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce: Supporting the Timber Industry, Requesting Reduced Shipping Costs from Shipping Companies, and Requesting the Railway Bureau to Use Domestic Products</h3>

<h3>Fertilizer Prices Fall: Bu Nei Men Distributes Large Quantities</h3>
<p>The price of fertilizer has fallen sharply in recent days.

Yongli goods have also fallen from 1.7 million yuan to 1.2 million yuan. Saltpeter was temporarily in short supply due to the lack of sulfuric acid, and saltpeter became the only substitute. Its price rose from 800,000 yuan per ton to 1.8 million yuan, but has now fallen to 1.3 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Chen Shizhen Returns to Province Today</h3>
<p>Inspects Various Schools in the Province and Counties After Staying in Suzhou for Two Days</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Suzhou on the 26th] Chen Shizhen, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, arrived in Suzhou from Shanghai at around 11:00 am on the 25th. Local leaders went to the station to welcome him. In the afternoon, Chen inspected the Industrial College, Provincial Women's College, Experimental Primary School, County Middle School, Suzhou Women's Normal School, and the Provincial Library. He then met with a special correspondent from this newspaper in Suzhou and made a statement: Jiangsu Province's education has a five-year plan. He believes that elementary school is the foundation of all education, so three years out of the five years will be spent on popularizing the establishment of national schools. Regarding educational administration, it has been decided that on December 1st, education bureaus will be fully established in the first and second-class counties of Jiangnan to strengthen the work force. A literacy movement will also be actively launched throughout the province to meet the needs of constitutional implementation. A special fund for literacy movement subsidies will be added to the education budget for the next year. Regarding teacher salaries, it has been decided that starting in October, the salaries of county-level teachers will be raised to the same level as those of provincial-level teachers. However, the four counties of Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Xishan are exceptions due to central government regulations, so the provincial level will still be slightly higher than the county level. However, the increase in this new standard will only be issued after the land tax is collected in kind. When the reporter inquired about the current situation of education in the recovered counties of northern Jiangsu, Chen said: When the Communist army controlled northern Jiangsu, it severely damaged education. The Huaiyin Agricultural School, which was very large in scale and had a good reputation, was completely destroyed. He has now applied to the central government for a special fund of 800 million yuan as a preparatory fund for the educational rehabilitation of the counties in northern Jiangsu that have been restored. When the reporter inquired about the proportion of the education budget, Chen replied: There is no specific regulation from the central government, but Jiangsu Province accounts for more than 30% of the total budget, and we hope to increase it further in the future. It is learned that Chen will stay in Suzhou for another day and will return to the provincial capital tomorrow (the 27th).</p>

<h3>Guozhen Cup Volleyball Finals: Soviet Union Wins Men's Championship, After a Fierce Five-Set Battle, Huayan Wins First and Loses Later, In the Women's Group, Friends United Defeats Friends in Four Sets</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In the Guozhen Cup Volleyball Tournament, the Soviet Union defeated Huayan by a score of 3 to 2 in the final last night, winning the men's championship. It was a pity that Huayan won first and lost later. The competition was fierce. The scores of the five sets were as follows: 19 to 21, 21 to 17, 19 to 21, 21 to 15, 21 to 18. In the women's group, Friends United defeated the Friends team last night with a stable and pure performance. After the Friends team won the first game with a score of 14 to 21, Friends United led all the way in the next three games. The Friends team tried hard to catch up, but all efforts failed. The scores were as follows: 14 to 21, 21 to 12, 24 to 22, 24 to 22. Chen Meizhen was the soul of the entire Friends United team, both in attack and defense. The Friends team seemed to have poor communication. Huang Mingyuan's spikes were often wild balls. However, although the Friends team lost, it protested after the game, saying that Friends United was 12 minutes late and should be forfeited, but the referee ordered the start of the game, so it is unknown how this will be explained. After the game, awards were given. Wang Weijun represented the mayor in giving the awards. The championship trophy for the women's group is temporarily reserved. Awards were also given at the same time for the first league. The champion of the men's first division, Huayan, received the Qian Dajun Silver Cup, and the champion of the women's division, Friends United, received the Qian Jianqiu Silver Cup.</p>

<p>Briefing on Civil Affairs</p>
<h3>Foreigners Who Have Been Naturalized as Chinese and Have Not Lost Their Chinese Nationality According to Law: Internal Regulations Do Not Treat Them as Foreign Nationals</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Interior has determined that the nationality of former foreigners or stateless persons who have been naturalized as Chinese under Article 2, Paragraph 5 of the Chinese Nationality Law and have also acquired the nationality of another country should be determined as follows: All foreigners or stateless persons who have been naturalized in our country in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 5 of the Chinese Nationality Law, or who have acquired Chinese nationality in accordance with Paragraphs 1 to 4 of the same article, or who are citizens of the Republic of China under Article 1 of the same law, must follow the provisions of Article 10, Article 11, and Article 4 of the Implementing Regulations of the same law to apply to the Ministry for approval to lose their Chinese nationality if they need to renounce their Republic of China nationality. Those who have not followed the above regulations, even if they have been naturalized in another country or acquired the nationality of another country, our government should still regard them as Chinese citizens and should not treat them as foreign nationals or non-Chinese. It is reported that the Ministry of Interior has telegraphed the city government to comply with the above determination.</p>
<h3>Civil Affairs Department Convenes Various Districts to Discuss Rationing Sugar by Population</h3>
<p>The draft implementation plan for rationing sugar by population in the city was previously approved by the Bureau of Social Affairs in conjunction with relevant agencies and reported to the city government for record. The above draft plan stipulates that all citizens of the city may obtain sugar purchase certificates from the local Baojia chiefs by presenting their household registration cards and identity cards. Those who have household registration but no identity card (such as children under the age of 13) are also entitled to sugar rationing rights. The sugar purchase certificates will be distributed by the Civil Affairs Department to the Baojia households in the districts, with each level responsible for signing for receipt. The City Sugar Price Review Committee has discussed the issuance of sugar purchase certificates and the start date of sales. In accordance with the committee's decision, the Civil Affairs Department held a meeting on rationing sugar by population with responsible persons from various districts at the city government conference room at 3:00 pm yesterday (the 26th). It is reported that all district chiefs attended the meeting, and representatives from the City Bureau of Social Affairs, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, Sugar Industry Association, and South Goods Industry Association also attended. Decisions were made regarding the issuance of sugar purchase certificates.</p>
<h3>Changes to Bao Chiefs in Two Districts</h3>
<p>Wang Zhifu, Bao Chief of the 46th Bao in the 18th District (Zhuolan Bridge), resigned due to illness, and his vacancy was filled by Wang Shunchang, the Deputy Bao Chief of the Bao. In addition, the position of Deputy Bao Chief of the 16th Bao in the 2nd District (Laozha) was vacant. After the Bao held a Jia Chief meeting, it elected Shen Zhangsong as the acting Deputy Bao Chief, and each district has reported to the city government for approval.</p>
<h3>Ninth District Elects Substitute District Representatives</h3>
<p>Chen Shanqing, the District Representative of the Fifth Bao in the Ninth District (Changning), has resigned due to illness. It is planned to have the first alternate, Lu Mingbo, fill the vacancy. This has been reported by the district to the municipal government for approval, it is said.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Promotes University Athletics - Allocates Funds to Subsidize Physical Education Departments</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 26th] In order to promote the development of athletics in universities, colleges, and vocational schools across the country, the Ministry of Education has planned to allocate special funds for universal subsidies to universities nationwide. Schools that do not yet have physical education departments will begin from the grassroots level. The funds required for this project are very large in total and not easily realized. It has now been decided to provide subsidies to national universities, colleges, and national vocational schools that already have physical education departments. Generally, there are six national schools with physical education departments, plus two national vocational schools, totaling eight schools (National Central University, Northwest Normal College, Beiping Normal School, Chongqing University, Lantian Normal College, National Women's Normal College, National Martial Arts Physical Education Normal Vocational School, National Physical Education Normal Vocational School), which will be eligible for subsidies to improve their athletic facilities. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has allocated a total of 4 million yuan for subsidies, with each school receiving approximately several hundred thousand yuan, it is said.</p>

<h3>Exploring Ancient Anyang - Record of the Excavation of Shang Dynasty Sacrificial Vessels</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Anyang, 18th. Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi of this newspaper</p>
<p>History tells us that after Pan Geng, the Shang people no longer migrated nomadically but began agricultural settlement. To establish a permanent life based on agriculture, Pan Geng led his subjects to relocate from Yan (in present-day Qufu, Shandong) to Gu, residing on the bank of the Huan River. This was the place where their former kings had lived.</p>
<p>The historical atmosphere of Anyang is too rich. The excavation of oracle bone inscriptions made the name of Xiaotun in Anyang known to the world. The brilliant Shang Dynasty culture is gradually accumulated into a strong impression from the unearthed antiquities, and engraved in our minds. Now running to this ancient city in northern Henan, apart from taking the train, it is simply inconvenient to walk around the suburbs. During the time of King Zhou of Shang, it is said in history that his detached palaces and villas extended south to Chaoge and north to Handan Shaqiu, showing the progress of civil engineering at that time. The agricultural settlement of over two hundred years from Pan Geng to King Zhou was the first era of wealth accumulation in Chinese history. Under the dual conditions of stability and wealth, Shang Dynasty culture achieved amazing accomplishments. But the current city in northern Henan is a city of soldiers, a city of battles. Naturally, it has been a famous military stronghold since ancient times. Xiang Yu broke cauldrons and sank boats to attack Zhao, leading his troops from here to meet with Qin's Zhang Han at Yin Xu on the bank of the Zhang River, which is also Anyang. But this is not enough to be proud of, because Chinese history can do without Xiang Yu or Liu Bang, but not without the people who inscribed oracle bones and cast bronze ware. The reporter finally couldn't help but ignore any advice or admonitions and, in the capacity of a Chinese, ventured to walk around the suburbs, because other Chinese people could walk, and even foreign missionaries could, so why couldn't I?</p>

<h3>Catalyst for National Revival - Still "Mediating Without Contact" for Decades</h3>
<p>During my week in Anyang, I "toured" four times, each time following the Huan River, now called the Anyang River. The first time was to Yuan Shikai's tomb on the north bank of the Huan River; the second time was to Qugou, where a battle had just taken place and where battles could occur at any time; the other two times were to Xiaotun (Yin Xu). If I couldn't go to Xiaotun after arriving in Anyang, I would have endless regrets. Cole, the former American representative of the Military Mediation Team, secretly went there alone once, when the situation was much more tense than it is now. Upon his return, he was kindly blamed, but he had gained something, having bought several pieces of oracle bones with inscriptions from the residents, which made him very satisfied.</p>
<p>There are still many oracle bones scattered among the people. Using antiques to exchange for money was invented by Chinese scholar-officials long ago, so can you blame these residents? One local person even told me that before the war, his family's oracle bones were packed in burlap sacks, and they had been moved around for eight years, but now he didn't know where they had gone. In Anyang, there are quite a few gentry who consider themselves refined and collect oracle bones or other antiques as family heirlooms, keeping them deeply hidden. In times when guns are more important than everything else, scholarship is bound to be neglected. Guo Moruo believed that studying these antiques was indeed a "catalyst" for national revival. I feel that our "catalyst," after decades of exploration by scholars, has indeed yielded considerable results, but it is ultimately mediating without contact, and our nation still cannot grasp the key. Antiques are kept, locked away, and traded in Chinese society, and their own fate is very pitiful. Just looking at the Anyang County Antiquities Preservation Office is saddening. Every item here is covered in dust. Yin Gui (wine vessel), Yin Gu (another kind of wine vessel), are casually discarded in a glass case. There are only a few dozen small pieces of oracle bones, and none of them have inscriptions, except for one piece with the characters "Gui Jia." There are also several pieces of bone artifacts (fish bones) and a bone arrowhead in the dusty cabinet. Those bone fragments and pottery shards seem to be about to be buried in the soil again. Another large hall is filled with Ming Dynasty sculptures, stone Buddhas, Song Dynasty iron Buddhas, as well as roof tiles, bricks, Han steles, and Wei steles – a pile of miscellaneous goods. The iron Buddhas and stone statues that don't fit are placed in the courtyard, exposed to the sun, night dew, and rain. Recently, a Shang Dynasty sacrificial vessel (I will introduce it in a special article) was transported from Wuguan Village and placed in the center, making the preservation office look like a Sanqing Hall without monks. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, antiques weighing about two tons were packed in boxes and transported to Nanyang. They have now been transported back, and it is said that nothing was lost. These former front-door sign crates are still thrown on the ground, not yet opened. There has been no investigation into how much the enemy took away from here after the war. It has been muddled along from the beginning and continues to be muddled.</p>

<h3>Visiting Yuan Shikai's Tomb Amidst the Thundering of Cannons</h3>
<p>On the 14th, I went to the area five li north of the city, with Yuan Shikai's tomb as the destination, to avoid going too far. I had asked the local people whether I would run into the Communist area if I wandered around. They replied that it was possible, "but you can easily tell." This person said, "If the village has blockhouses, the stockade is well-built, and there are soldiers guarding posts, then it is a place with National soldiers. The first thing the Eighth Route Army does when they enter a village is to tear down the blockhouses, flatten the stockade, and there are no rules for guarding posts, only a few people are sent to squat by the roadside or in the flower fields."</p>
<p>As soon as I reached the suburbs, the thundering of cannons became very clear, coming from the northeast. The cannon fire had been going on for more than a dozen hours. The military said this was common, and the locals said it was even more lively a week ago. Five li north of the city is the Huan River, and there is an Anyang Bridge on it that can accommodate four large trucks side by side. Before there was a railway, this was originally the main route to the north. Anyang was built in the Yuan Dynasty and called the Whale Back Bridge. It has a history of seven hundred years and was only blown up two holes during this War of Resistance, sacrificing itself in the ethnic liberation war. The water of the Huan River is so shallow and clear that you can't see that this was once a place where ancient giant reptiles roamed. On the northwest bank of the bridge is Cuihu Village, where Yuan Shikai is buried. It is said that it was a "national" funeral at the time, complete with a stele pavilion, pavilions, stone figures, and stone archways. Among the stone figures, some wear ancient ceremonial clothing and others wear Beiyang military uniforms, which is truly incongruous. A person whose country was not successfully established was still given a "national funeral," which is also an incredible thing. The stone tablet in the stele pavilion reads: "Tomb of the Late President Yuan Gong Shikai." Although he was not an emperor, he was still a president. The construction project lasted for two years, and its magnificence was completely incomparable to the dilapidated village houses. Now, a company of soldiers is stationed here, with bullet holes in the glazed walls and fortifications being built. A bunker has been built on top of the tomb. Is this not disrespectful to the "national" funeral? It is truly a comical interlude in modern history.</p>
<h3>The Sight of Building Stockades on Flat Ground is Breathtaking</h3>
<p>It wasn't until I visited the western suburbs of Anyang that I saw the greatness of the defense works. The blockhouses along the Jinpu and Jinghu Railways cannot compare. To put it simply, this is a city. They are all built around individual villages, which the locals call "stockades." Some are simply built on flat ground, with houses built inside and wells dug. The perimeter is surrounded by one or two moats, and then enclosed with barbed wire. These moats are up to two zhang deep and one zhang five chi wide, dug extremely steep, and it is impossible to climb out if you fall in. One square city is one hundred meters long and wide, the largest one, built entirely from flat ground. The manpower, wood, and wheat straw were all requisitioned from the local area. It is conceivable how much burden the common people bear. According to local estimates, "thirty billion won't be enough." This refers to the fortifications already built in Anyang.</p>
<p>These earthen walls, up to one zhang five chi high, are built entirely of mud mixed with chopped wheat straw. Every village has one. If one village is developed after another, less than ten thousand villages would be enough to build a Great Wall. The Great Wall in those years was just an earthen wall, and the carts of corvée labor at that time have long been recorded in history. Today, the burden of these works in one corner of northern Henan is also becoming a Great Wall.</p>
<p>When the Communist army leaves, they take all the supplies, and the farmers are also mobilized. What remains are dilapidated houses. The land has already been distributed, and the people who got the land are being asked to join the army in various ways, to take up arms against the government, saying they are protecting their land, protecting the "fruits of their liberation." Some people say: The reason they divided the land to us wasn't to have us farm, but to have us join the army and fight. Anyway, there is no way to complain. The farmers think, how can they leave the land? They quietly return, only to see dilapidated houses, not even plows, so they have to sit on the rubble and cry, blaming their bad luck. Now they have to do corvée labor to build the stockades, saying it is to protect their homeland. On a piece of land that has been sown, because of the lack of animal power, a woman with bound feet is dragging a stone roller to compress the soil. You see in this photo, she is simply working herself like an ox.</p>
<p>In the area west of Qugou, the masses simply cannot go to harvest, as bullets do not recognize people. They cannot go during the day, and even less at night, because firefights often happen at night. In the western plain of Anyang, it is now the time for cotton to ripen. Some local troops want to take 60 percent, saying, "Without us, could you harvest it?" It is reasonable to take it. It is said that there is a special agency in the city. This is truly a special place. Standing on the stockade and looking out at these areas that cannot be harvested, I see no one coming or going, and cotton is scattered all over the ground. Two li away is the Communist village. Bales of cotton are transported south from Anyang truck after truck. You will not see the specks of blood and tears of the northern Henan farmers on them.</p>
<p>During the Warring States period, Ximen Bao governed Ye (present-day Anyang), diverting water from the Zhang River to create canals to benefit agriculture. During the Tang Dynasty, the Wanjin Canal was opened, which irrigated the western part of Anyang. For thousands of years, the land here has been fertile. Now, because of the war, the Communist army has blocked the canal opening on the Heng River, so there is no water here. Yellow soil cannot store water, and without water, it is close to becoming a desert. This kind of yellow soil is also very good, easy to dig and cut, and able to build fortifications so beautifully and solidly.</p>

<h3>Xiaotun's First Journey, a Small Village Known Around the World</h3>
<p>Xiaotun and its surrounding areas, perhaps due to "strategic" considerations, have not been fortified with stockades. The people of Xiaotun proudly say: "The people here are all educated, and not a single one has joined the Eighth Route Army." I went there twice on the 17th and 18th. This small village, known around the world, has only twenty-odd households with the surnames He, Huo, and Zhang, with more than two hundred residents. Many middle-aged people asked me with concern about Mr. Dong Zuobin and Mr. Li Ji, asking where they were now. They clearly remembered the situations when the Academia Sinica sent Dong to excavate several times between 1918 and 1921, with more than a thousand workers involved, and schools were even held in the evenings. Dong explained oracle bone inscriptions to them, telling them the true significance of excavating antiquities. The people of Xiaotun understand this very well, and some farmers even recognize oracle bone characters. A farmer who used to cook for the excavation team introduced me to an old man to buy a royal vessel, saying, "You can take it back with you, it is indeed from the Three Dynasties." He used the foreign term "Three Dynasties." I also obtained a piece of cloth-patterned pottery, a piece of black pottery with an animal head, a bone awl, ten fragments of oracle bones, and a bronze axe. Their purpose was to exchange them for some money, but they also happily believed that I was someone who "knew" things. They often find some broken pieces at home to sell.</p>
<p>Dong established a school for the people of Xiaotun. They all lamented this, thinking that if there hadn't been a war, this school would have been great if it had been run until now. It is said that the school also taught oracle bone inscription classes, which was quite scholarly. Some residents have a surprising knowledge of antiquities. They understand the excavation methods and recognize the age of the soil. They said that the Japanese in the city had wanted to come and dig, but they didn't know where to start, so it was concluded that "these people haven't done any research, they just want to get rich. If they had done research, wouldn't they know where to dig?"</p>
<p>These farmers commonly suffer from eye diseases and malnutrition. The eyes of a young boy had already gone blind. The children are generally thin and emaciated, eating sorghum rice without vegetables, dropping a large bowl of yellow sorghum rice with their small hands and squatting on the muddy ground to eat. Each household bears the burden of corvée labor, contributing burial materials, bran, wheat, and money, costing tens of thousands of yuan a month. If they could buy some eggs and meat with this money, the young boy might not have gone blind.</p>
<p>The farmer who had cooked for the excavation team asked me, "The Academia Sinica should be coming back now, right?" He pointed to the cotton field by the Huan River, saying that six large turtle shells were found there and transported away with the soil. We walked along the bank of the Huan River, and he told me everywhere what had been found in a certain place. He became my archeology professor. They recalled the life of three to five cents a day they lived for during excavation, as if it were a dream. Thinking of the life of fifteen years ago, seeing me, an unexpected guest, they associated it with the Academia Sinica, saying, "The Academia Sinica should be coming back now, right?"</p>
<h3>Recently Excavated Sacrificial Furnace - Covered with Green Rust, Full of Ancient Charm</h3>
<p>After arriving in Anyang, I met with the Secretary-General of the Anyang County Government, who talked about a recently unearthed ancient vessel. Because I had heard about this vessel, I wanted to investigate it thoroughly after arriving in Anyang. He told me that it was a furnace, weighing over a thousand catties, and that there was some entanglement involved. It is said that the person who "presented" this ancient vessel was not entirely the original owner. He was a traitor during the Japanese occupation of Anyang and wanted to use this to cleanse himself. But others involved with this vessel were figures from the War of Resistance, and their purpose was not about ownership, but they were reluctant to have this person come forward to "present" it. The Secretary-General said that our government doesn't care, and whoever "presents" it is fine. The government, of course, has only one word: accept. It is said that this ancient vessel was unearthed as early as 1939. It was too big and heavy, so it was quietly reburied. When the news leaked out, the Japanese were willing to buy it for 70,000 puppet yuan, but they did not succeed. It is said that a smaller piece was sent out, but the larger piece was preserved thanks to a "sense of national pride." But what that smaller piece was is unknown. The excavation site is in Wuguan Village, on the north bank of this river, about seven li northwest of Anyang. This area is still unstable today. This past July, the county government asked the local garrison to provide cover to cross the Huan River and rush to transport it over.</p>
<p>About two li southeast of the south bank of Wuguan Village is Yin Tan, which is Xiaotun today. The Academia Sinica had excavated in both places. The excavation site of this ancient vessel is near the tomb of He Jia Ling, (He Jia directed the excavation here and obtained many vessels. Refer to the report of the Academia Sinica, Commercial Press edition.) After being transported to the city, it was placed in the Antiquities Preservation Office.</p>
<p>Structure</p>
<p>This vessel is three chi and two cun high and one chi and two cun wide. It has two ears and four legs. The weight is unknown. Each side is about half an inch thick. It is made of bronze. Looking at the color of the copper, the quality is quite pure. This is a sacrificial vessel. In oracle bone inscriptions, 子 is written as 祄, 子 means the first month, because the first month is mainly for sacrifices, so the character 子 became the pictograph of sacrificial vessels. Looking at the shape of this vessel and comparing it with oracle bone inscriptions, it becomes clear at a glance. The oracle bone inscription character 子 looks like 你. It is clear that the square shapes from the Yin sacrificial vessel drawing are all available, and this one is rectangular.</p>
<p>The entire vessel can be divided into eleven parts: four sides, one bottom, four legs, and two ears. The two ears were soldered on. One ear has completely detached from the solder, and is currently still buried in the soil. One ear shown in the photo is detached at one end from the solder and broken at the other, and is also completely separated from the vessel itself. It is temporarily attached during photography. If the copper shavings from the joint could be taken for chemical analysis, it may be possible to know the soldering method used at that time. This detached ear is actually very stable when placed back on, completely in the center of gravity.</p>
<p>As for the vessel itself, there are no signs of soldering. The four legs are hollow and connected to the bottom of the vessel. Looking into the vessel from above, four round holes can be seen at the four corners of the vessel. The ears are also hollow.</p>
<p>The entire body is covered with mottled green rust, full of ancient charm. Hardened soil, in the form of grains and flakes, has chemically reacted with the copper body, firmly adhering to the copper. It cannot be shaken loose with fingers.</p>
<p>Patterns</p>
<p>The ears, legs, and sides have relief patterns. It is not accurate to say that they are entirely carved. They were mostly carved when the mold was made, and then scraped and modified after casting. The ears have patterns on three sides, but not on the inside. The legs have patterns all around. The bottom of the vessel has two sets of rough raised lines, intersecting to form a "ten" shape, and the bottom of the vessel forms a "出" shape.</p>
<p>The engraved patterns can be roughly divided into three layers. One layer is the background pattern, the second layer is 饕餮, and the third layer is the engraved pattern on the relief. In many places, the edges and corners of the cuts are very prominent.</p>
<p>Now, let's assume that the pattern of this vessel is 饕餮. The basic background pattern is the 回纹 pattern, in the shape of 饕餮. I have seen pottery shards with 回龙纹 patterns. This time, I obtained a square pottery shard with a 回龙纹 pattern in Yin Xu. The 回龙纹 is very neat, showing that the 回龙纹 pattern was commonly used by the Yin people. Is the oracle bone inscription "亘" (river) 昝, a pictographic representation of the Huan River producing a dragon? The third layer is also a 回龙纹, or a simplified 回龙纹.</p>
<p>The four corners of the vessel are raised with four ridges, and each leg is also raised with a ridge. The upper and lower parts of each side of the vessel are raised with a ridge, which are also 饕餮 patterns.</p>
<p>There are six complete dragons and four dragon heads on each side in relief. The two dragons on the ears are obviously different. One ear has a round horn, and the third layer of纹 is strong, with straight lines. For now, let's call it Dragon A. The other ear has a sharp horn, and the third layer of纹 has softer lines. For now, let's call it Dragon B. Looking at the two ears together, it is a human head (also in relief). Perhaps this is a male and a female.</p>
<p>The two complete dragons on the upper edge of the vessel's sides are all Dragon A; the two complete dragons on the lower edge are all Dragon B, (but the basic 土 of the third layer of纹 is all 回龙纹, different from Dragon A). Although the four dragon heads at the four corners are all Dragon B, the two dragon heads on the upper corners each have an extra "horn." This point differentiates them from Dragons A and B, so let's call them Dragon C.</p>
<p>As shown in the picture, there is a dragon head with horns below the lower end of the ear and the edge of the vessel, which is the Dragon C with horns on the side of the vessel.</p>
<p>As for the four dragons on the four legs, they are all Dragon B.</p>
<p>This time, I also obtained a black pottery shard with a small animal head in Xiaotun. After bringing it back and checking, I realized that it was exactly two dragons.</p>
<p>The relief in the upper left corner of one side of this vessel is damaged. If it was not damaged during reproduction, it was burned in a large fire, or perhaps the latter is more credible, because the two dragon heads near the ear and leg have not desoldered, only broken. Or, the solder joint may have melted in high heat, thus making it solid. The other leg and the two legs of the other ear, however, are desoldered.</p>
<p>Interpretation</p>
<p>This vessel has an inscription, located in the center of the inside of the vessel. It is the oracle bone inscription "后妻戊" (Hou Qi Wu) in intaglio. The edges and corners of the engraving are very clear, and the depth is more than one cun. It cannot be done with iron tools, so this vessel must be from the end of the Yin Dynasty. Perhaps this can even serve as evidence that the Yin Dynasty had iron tools.</p>
<p>The three characters "后妻戊" are actually two characters. Yin oracle bone inscriptions often have the habit of writing names together, such as Bao Bing, Bao Yi, and Da Yi (Tang). Like the Yin people's names: Father Ding, Brother Geng, are often written as one unit. These names are a whole concept, so it is very natural to write them as one unit.</p>
<p>This "Qi Wu," like the examples of Father Ding and Brother Geng, means that this lady's original name was "Wu." At this time, she became Hou Qi. Her husband (one of the Yin kings) had this sacrificial vessel - this large bronze rice bowl - cast to worship her and commemorate her. Now I don't know which Yin king's wife "Qi Wu" was. I only brought a pen and ran to Anyang. If I could look up the books and find out, then the exact date of the vessel could be calculated.</p>
<p>My other non-conforming thought is: If the so-called Hou Qi is what her children and grandchildren called her, then "Qi Wu" may have meant "Madam Wu" or "Mrs. Wu." "Hou Qi Wu" could even be read as "Hou Wu Qi," but there is no example to support this, as there is above. Among the Yin kings after Tang, there was one called Da Wu, the fourth generation after Tang. Da Wu was a capable ruler in the early Shang period, perhaps greatly aided by his virtuous wife, and was extremely admired and respected by later generations, who specially cast a vessel to worship her. But ultimately, this is unfounded.</p>
<p>This vessel's style is solemn, although it has not lost its heroic and uninhibited spirit. However, the engraving is neat and precise. It must have been made when agricultural settlement had been established for quite some time and the copper smelting industry had a considerable scale of equipment, so it was produced at the earliest after Pan Geng.</p>
<p>The reporter is not an archeology expert, but in today's environment full of war, I feel that the vessel's encounter is also extraordinary. Although bronze vessels are not as interesting as cannons, I am happy to report on them.</p>
<p>The area of He Jia Ling is undoubtedly the location of the Yin temple, especially during the time of King Zhou, when the scale was greatly expanded. However, he did not worship his ancestors (one of the reasons why King Wu attacked King Zhou). Perhaps it had been buried until now in the great fire that destroyed the Shang Dynasty. Didn't the early Zhou dynasty states of Bei, Yong, and Wei already have a sense of desolation?</p>

<h3>Asking "What to Do?"! Sighing "What Can Be Done!"! Guilin's Sad Tale of October</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Guilin Air Dispatch, 16th</p>
<p>Autumn in Guilin is synonymous with dryness. People living there are like ants on a hot pan, with no way out. Occasionally, when an autumn wind rises, yellow sand covers the face. Pedestrians slow their steps, always worrying that the dilapidated buildings beside them will collapse with a "bang." This is what they call the "wind" and "feeling" of late autumn in Guilin.</p>
<p>A few days ago, a chick that had just hatched on Donghua Road in the city flapped its wings and chirped, arousing people's curiosity and becoming a topic of conversation. In a few days, people will look at the grand gathering of the "parent officials" with another mood! At the Provincial Local Administration Conference in the 35th year, they will listen to the endless grievances of ninety-nine county magistrates and one mayor. A small matter, a big matter, these are the most exciting stories in the cold city in late autumn.</p>
<p>In addition to responding to the movement to donate schools to celebrate birthdays, the provincial authorities have also dedicated two roads, renaming Guixi Road and Guidong Road as Zhongzheng Road. For the sake of General Zhongzheng, some people remembered the magnificent Zhongzheng Bridge from two years ago. Now, with only four bridge pillars remaining, they plan to change their minds at the administrative conference.</p>
<p>The Plague Messengers are Reluctant to Leave Guangxi</p>
<p>Diseases have rapidly spread throughout northern Guilin, claiming many lives. The terribleness of the situation cannot be described in words. From Guilin north to Xing'an, no less than 80,000 people are suffering from this disease. From the county magistrate down to the minor staff, the entire Xing'an county government is "shivering," unable to handle official business. The atmosphere inside the yamen is filled with disease. In the villages of Ziyuan, a natural village lost 500 people in less than half a month (how big are the villages in Guangxi?). According to statistics from Rong County, the medicine "Kuining Wan" is sold out in Guilin, and cases of death due to poisoning from "Kuining Wan," turning into blackwater fever, are also common. In the villages, three catties of rice can be exchanged for a single anti-fever pill. Many farmers would rather lie quietly in bed and die than use their sweat and blood to exchange for these "useless things." There is no greater suffering than this. What is strange is that the Plague Messengers are reluctant to leave Guangxi, but why doesn't the Department of Health even glance at it? People are panicking because of the diseases, and the double-cropping rice fields are also being ravaged by insects, resulting in white ears, empty grains, and withered stalks throughout southwestern Guangxi (especially in the Nanning area). The rice is just heading, so they cannot use pruning machines or insect combing tools. They can only watch helplessly as they harvest some straw to burn. The first crop failed, and the second crop yielded nothing. They dare not imagine the spring of next year.</p>
<p>The Egg Changes Hands, Losing an Ounce Each Time</p>
<p>In famine years, with poor harvests and terror creeping in, relief is like a cast-iron anchor for a sailboat in a stormy sea, and there can be no falsehood. A single lie means the death of millions of lives under the sound of "relief, relief." The relief work in Guangxi in recent years has certainly not had any so-called successful results. Perhaps it is a matter of things not going as desired, or perhaps it is human failure. In any case, countless people have died, which is a fact, and not being able to think of a good solution is also a fact. The Director Huang of the Relief Sub-Bureau is enthusiastic, but how many staff members' minds have been twisted by the various kinds of relief supplies! "The egg changes hands, losing an ounce each time." In the end, it is mostly "the west wind rolls up the curtains, and people are fatter than chrysanthemums." Not to mention the disaster victims being reduced to wailing, even the relief clothes that the Sub-Bureau generously distributed to civil servants of various Guilin institutions (such as the city government and newspapers) these days are like the badges worn by officials of the late Qing Dynasty and the fake banners used to summon souls during funerals, torn and tattered, simply treating civil servants like beggars. From this, one can imagine what the refugees will get. Does the United Relief only see the Chinese as beggars? Probably not. Relief supplies are displayed at the beginning of the street in Guilin, and relief supplies are also displayed at the end of the street, and they are all "Chinese attire," exquisite and unparalleled.</p>
<p>New Cars Arrive, Relief Flour Piles Up in Warehouses</p>
<p>Thousands of tons of relief flour are mildewing in the warehouses, and they constantly complain that relief supplies lack transportation. Batches of brand-new "CHT" Dodge vehicles are "loafing" in Guilin Square, rushing around and killing time. If anyone interferes, the driver glares and shouts, "It's the Executive Yuan's business, you're not qualified to interfere!" Oh, Buddha! The relief slogan posted by the Guangxi Sub-Bureau is: "No work, no food." Presumably, these unemployed waiting for orders are eating bread.</p>
<p>Recently, the Executive Relief Administration, concerned about the starving and freezing refugees, is reportedly planning to transport a large quantity of fabric to Guilin for distribution. The quantities are 18 bales of cotton cloth, 460 bales of fabric, 26 bedsheets, 3699 bolts of China Textile fabric, 700 bales of twill fabric, and 250 bales of cotton. Winter is deep, with cold winds and frost. In the past, refugees received ten or eight taels of flour per person. I think, when the fabric is distributed, it won't be as ridiculous as ten or eight inches per person.</p>
<p>Speaking of relief, there is also an interlude. The Guangxi civil servants, who have suffered greatly, asked the Executive Relief Administration to show compassion, and the Executive Relief Administration's reply was: "Civil servants are not the target of relief," so "it is difficult to make an exception to provide relief." In case an exception is made, the civil servants will never finish wearing the relief clothes. The Executive Relief Administration is a bit like the God of Wealth. Poor scholars encountering the God of Wealth often hear things like "difficult," "difficult." Heaven and earth are fair.</p>
<p>No Cars, No Coal, When Will Guiliu Be Connected?</p>
<p>For many days, the news about the Hunan-Guizhou-Guangxi Railway has seemed to be nothing more than filling in a "indefinite repair" formula. The days drag on, the people are distressed, the railway bureau's employees are distressed, and the reporter's pen is also distressed. The opening of just a short section of the road (from Suqiao to Guilin South Station) recently aroused the excitement of countless people. The train, bathed in sunshine, stepped onto the steel rails that had been separated for two years. The locomotive and carriages were like an old ox, and every breath told of countless hardships and difficulties. The carriage and bridge materials were dug out from piles of grass and underwater, repaired and chiseled by hand, and used as best as possible. (The repair work can only be tried on sections that were not heavily damaged. As for the destroyed large bridges, they still collapse and hang in the heart of the river, accompanied by dawn mist and the sadness of treading the moon.) The train entered the South Station with a long whistle, echoing in the hearts of the people in front of the station, both sour and sweet. After two years of silence, it was a reunion. Who can not feel infinite emotion at the sight of the fire dragon running again? However, under the infinite emotion, there is still an infinite emotion. The test run is only a flash in the pan, and the days of operation are still uncertain. At present, with no coal and no cars, the check for the opening of the Guiliu line by the end of November is probably still uncleared, and it needs to be "rediscounted."</p>
<p>Land Transportation Blocked, Seeking Recovery by Air</p>
<p>If land transportation is blocked, air transportation can still be vigorous. Southwest Airlines is planning to resume operations and has received central support, allowing it to allocate aircraft for use and open the Guangdong-Taiwan and Guangdong-Guangxi routes. If it can start flights early, future development can be expected. The current issues to be resolved are the profit and personnel issues of the Guangdong-Guangxi joint venture airline.</p>
<p>In the changing season between late autumn and cold winter, Guilin is always the same quiet. The change of seasons is just an ordinary change in people's eyes. Their hearts are deeper than the Seven Star Cave. Only the noble people are excited and busy building Western-style houses in a large open space in the northwest suburbs in winter, beautifully named "Little Dongshan" (Note: Dongshan is a residential area for high-ranking officials and wealthy people in Guangzhou), showing off their jewels, multi-storied buildings, and overlooking the poor city of Guilin.</p>

<h3>The Completeness of the Performance: A Review of the Actors in "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace"</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiong</p>
<p>A play's performance must be complete! In order to achieve a complete performance, actors must give up individual cheers and applause!</p>
<p>The "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" performed by the Audience Performance Company is generally welcomed by the public. The Shanghai audience praised the character of Li Lianying in it. The reason for this is not that the actor playing Li Lianying truly typified this character, but because he played it more prominently than others, flaunting his own acting skills and using an unreasonably yin and yang voice. Yang Hua is an actor who understands the audience and knows how to attract them. His makeup as Li Lianying's external appearance gave this role infinite charm. But I dare not consider the blood and flesh he gave this role suitable. Naturally, Li Lianying is a eunuch, a male figure who will never grow a beard. His actions and speech may have some feminine flavor. However, the impression Yang Hua gave me was not this. There wasn't even the slightest feminine feeling. The overall feeling was only insidious and strange speech. Other than that, there was nothing else. I watched "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" a total of three times, but not once was I able to fully understand Li Lianying's conversations. Sometimes his voice was low and fast, and it was simply impossible to hear what he was saying. This cannot be denied: it is not the failure of this audience member, but the failure of the actor!</p>
<p>Many actors who come from the mainland used to work in war zones and rural areas. When performing, they act with actors who have no stage experience, which makes them develop this habit of "standing out" and "teasing the audience." In that period and region, we could forgive them! But now, it is unforgivable! Because now it is national, representing the highest level of artistic performance in the country! Therefore, what we demand is the completeness of the performance, not the individual applause for the actors. The completeness of "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" has clearly been destroyed by Yang Hua.</p>
<p>Kou Liancai is a seventeen-year-old young eunuch. When I read the script, I was very fond of him. I found him cute, innocent, and righteous. But in the performance, I felt that the actor's broken voice and his silly tone made him seem like an old man pretending to be innocent.</p>
<p>The actor who plays this role is Shen Yang. His only advantage is being able to drill his own emotions into the character's personality. But consistently having a pretentiously innocent silly tone can also be said to be his only shortcoming. However, in any case, he is much stronger than those actors who have no emotions and only rely on external skills.</p>
<p>Kou Jiabi, who plays Weng Tonghe, replaced Zhang Yan in the middle of the performance, giving us a comparison. Zhang Yan's Weng Tonghe cannot be considered insufficient, but his age for this role was not old enough, so he did not resemble a weak teacher of the king, but rather a veteran general on the battlefield. Kou Jiabi, however, made up for this point. He made his own appearance, his actions, and his voice, and even his personality, all suitable for this weak and stubborn teacher of the king, Tonghe.</p>
<h3>An Epic, Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lei</p>
<p>After returning from victory, Lianhua's first film to begin production was "Before and After Victory," written and directed by Shi Dongshan. It has now been renamed "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon," using a line from Yue Fei's "Manjianghong" as the title. This is more appropriate in terms of content and consciousness. Yesterday, I met Mr. Shi Dongshan and learned the entire story. I must say: this will be a landmark masterpiece among domestic films. Its achievement will be the most brilliant page in this year's domestic films!</p>
<p>The story takes the arduous journey experienced by a pair of exiled actors, Libin (played by Tao Jin) and Lingyu (played by Bai Yang), before and after victory as the warp, and the major national events and social conditions before and after victory as the weft. In terms of time, it spans from the early days of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Battle of Shanghai, the Battle of Xuzhou, the Victory of Northern Hunan, the Battle of Guizhou-Guangxi, to the surrender of the invading bandits, and then the return from Chongqing to Shanghai. In terms of region, it almost traverses most of China's war zones, truly enduring hardship and witnessing eight thousand li of cloud and moon. The most important point is that Mr. Shi uses profound strokes to reflect the strange social phenomena and the miserable lives of the people in various places, such as the difficulties of returning home after peace, the real situation of the disaster areas in Jiangxi provinces, the brutal officials forcibly collecting military rations, the disaster victims selling their children, and the profiteering and corruption of several receiving officials after returning to Shanghai, the extravagant enjoyment of the rich, the influx of American goods into the market, the hospitals extorting patients... A pair of poor artists have experienced the vicissitudes of life and have infinite feelings. The story ends with Bai Yang giving birth to a new life in the hospital, placing infinite hope in the sadness and emotion. The whole film has a sad tone and amazing power, truly writing and painting ten years of historical facts, a thrilling chronicle of a chaotic world!</p>
<p>This play makes me think of Noel Coward's "Cavalcade," which spanned thirty years of national events from the end of the Boer War (1899) through the First World War to 1930. The play also uses a pair of Robert couple as the warp, and the stories that happen around them as the weft. Compared with "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon," the former tends to write with sentimental and light strokes, while the latter boldly exposes the various aspects of Chinese society with more active and realistic strokes. In terms of atmosphere, the latter may be slightly inferior to the former, but its effectiveness as a realistic needle cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>The entire film has now completed one-fifth of its filming. According to company officials, it can probably be presented around Christmas this year. The audience can wait patiently for this famous film to arrive!</p>
<h3>The Leads of "Of Mice and Men"</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Wu Yonggang's "Of Mice and Men" is scheduled to begin filming on the 15th. The main actors are movie queen Hu Die (playing Ji Ruolan), movie emperor Jin Yan, and Liu Qiong. After Jin Yan finishes filming "Of Mice and Men," he will go to the United States to participate in Sun Yu's color film, co-starring with Li Lili.</p>
<h3>Playwrights of China Today</h3>
<p>— Naya</p>
<p>In today's low-ebb Chinese drama scene, no powerful new playwrights have emerged; even several of those old, unnoticed ones are good. At the same time, no one has individually introduced them. Now, I will introduce and review several playwrights that everyone is familiar with:</p>
<p>Cao Yu: -- Mentioning this name, everyone will definitely think of his few plays, "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," "Wilderness," "Beijing Man," these masterpieces! Yes, he is a well-known figure in today's drama scene. Speaking of his plays, they are very well-crafted. Just looking at the fact that he only has these few works after so many years, you can tell that he is a "difficult birth" author.</p>
<p>Although Cao Yu is a well-known author, he has now gone abroad; but judging from his works, his thinking seems to be very backward, a "fatalistic" one, as seen in "Thunderstorm" and "Wilderness." He often arranges a character into "fate," such as in "Thunderstorm," when Sifeng swears to her mother that she will be struck by lightning; as a result, she leaves and is struck by lightning. This kind of line that promotes superstition can be said to be his only mistake.</p>
<p>I hope he can correct this mistake of backward thinking in the future. He has a future in the Chinese drama scene.</p>
<p>Chen Baichen: -- "Officialdom" has been performed to this day, and no one will forget his masterpiece; in modern times, he is also one of the famous writers. Before the war, he had a successful work: the historical drama "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." After the war, "Devil's Cave" ("The New Official Takes Office") is also considered a masterpiece.</p>
<p>In his scripts, the skills in crafting dialogue are excellent; he is only in his thirties this year, so his future works will certainly be many. Currently, there are bound to be erroneous viewpoints in his scripts, such as "Officialdom" and "The New Official Takes Office" that are currently being staged. The official in "Officialdom" seems a bit too excessive. The official says whatever he wants, and he forgets the rights of the people.</p>
<p>Because of his youth, his future is also shining brightly.</p>
<p>Yuan Jun: -- Also known as Zhang Junxiang, his work "Model Teacher for All Ages" was praised by Chairman Chiang. Other works such as "Small Town Story" and "Phoenix City" are also his proud works.</p>
<p>He is a playwright and director. Didn't we see that when "Model Teacher for All Ages" was staged in Shanghai, it was written by Yuan Jun and directed by Zhang Junxiang? From this, we can see his versatility.</p>
<p>Although the performance of "Model Teacher for All Ages" was a deception, his direction was successful. The reason for the failure was the subject matter of the script, which did not seem to be in line with the current era.</p>
<p>His ability to cooperate with his wife, Ms. Bai Yang, will contribute more to the drama scene in the future.</p>
<p>Li Jianwu: -- He is not a successful one among playwrights. This is something that people who engage in drama all know, and it cannot be hidden. He has written many works, mostly scripts, but also novels and essays, but it is impossible to point out which one is particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>He has made great contributions to culture. He is the editor of "Literary Renaissance" and has also worked hard in drama. I hope he can produce several successful works in the future.</p>
<h3>China Electric News</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a scene was filmed for "Distant Love," with news reporters taking news photos, requiring the use of a mirror box and magnesium light equipment. "China News Photo Agency" generously agreed to lend it. The agency's photographer, Huang Ningmin, personally brought his "livelihood" to China Electric Second Factory and took many work photos of "Distant Love."</p>
<p>When filming a "wharf" scene for "Distant Love," director Chen Liting specially dispatched stagehand Zhuang Kailu to invite a wonton vendor to the filming location to act as a temporary extra in order to achieve realism. There were more than 300 temporary extras at the factory. They waited a long time to film and had nothing to do, so they frequently ate wontons. Before filming even started, the entire load of 30 catties of noodles and 20 catties of wonton wrappers was consumed. The wonton vendor restocked and still had booming business. Old Guan was always smiling.</p>

<h3>The Sadness of Cyrano</h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>Reading "Cyrano"</p>
<p>Rostand's "Cyrano" received honorable recognition when it was first performed by actor Coquelin in 1897. Coquelin was an actor who could fence and recite poetry, but he never had the opportunity to play this type of character, so Rostand wrote this "Cyrano" for him.</p>
<p>Cyrano is a versatile figure who can fence and recite poetry, but he has an extremely ugly big nose, which became an obstacle to his love.</p>
<p>The three main characters in "Cyrano" are Cyrano, Christian, and Roxane. Roxane is Cyrano's cousin, and she is a beautiful girl. Cyrano loves her, but because of his big nose, he dares not tell his cousin the passion in his heart. Christian is a handsome man, but his mind is empty. He is a fool who can neither fence nor write poetry. Because of his handsome appearance, Roxane falls in love with him. At the same time, because of his lack of talent, Roxane may very well not love him. Our hero Cyrano cannot bear for Roxane to suffer, so he uses his own talents to replace Christian in winning this glorious love, promoting the success of the two of them, while he hides to the side and deeply buries the love in his heart.</p>
<p>Christian died in battle. Roxane stayed in a nunnery for fourteen years. Cyrano never left her. When Cyrano was assassinated and about to die, Roxane discovered this secret. She said: I only loved one person and lost him twice!</p>
<p>"Cyrano" is a great work of the late nineteenth century, full of romantic colors. This romantic tragedy has left a deep impression on many people!</p>
<p>Cyrano is a hero in battle! He is a genius among poets! But he lacks a bit of harmony. God did not give him a beautiful face, making him a tragic figure in the arena of love. Although he is a weakling in the arena of love, daring not to boldly tell Roxane his innermost feelings, he is a martyr who understands love. Because he loves the other person too much, he is afraid of being rejected if he speaks his love, so he willingly hides his love in his heart until the last moment of his life.</p>
<p>He is willing to hide in the dark and speak love words to Roxane on the balcony, but let Christian climb up to accept that glorious kiss!</p>
<p>The sadness of Cyrano: It can all be seen in one of his words: "My fate is to be a wire-puller behind people - that is, finally forgotten! (Speaking to Roxane) Do you remember that night when Christian talked to you under the balcony? Well, that's my fate: I hide in the darkness below, and others go up to take that glorious kiss, this is justice. I still praise Moliere for his talent and Christian for his appearance in front of my grave!"</p>
<h3>One Week of Film Reviews</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>Of all the films this week, "The Life of Emile Zola" is considered the best, but "Tarzan Goes to New York" will likely have the highest box office takings.</p>
<p>The Life of Emile Zola</p>
<p>Small places surpass big places. For example, the scenes from the initial publication of the novel "Nana" to Zola receiving manuscript fees to buy an umbrella are filmed using small snippets, employing a method that deserves close scrutiny. For instance, the long speech delivered by Zola in court relies entirely on the expressions of Paul Muni, which, directorially speaking, cannot be considered a success. Paul Muni excels in small actions. After the film ends, the large advertisements of Paul's full body outside the theater door have a lifelike quality.</p>
<p>Tarzan Goes to New York</p>
<p>In terms of the techniques used in Tarzan films, this is still a top-notch piece. For instance, the elephant herd scenes at the beginning are not the same as before, and the high pole and iron bridge diving scene is excellent.</p>
<p>Adding Mandarin dialogue explanations is not something I can support. At least in Shanghai, which has a long history of Western films, it is unlikely to be welcomed by most people.</p>
<p>Lucky Mr. Prockter</p>
<p>A comedy theme, but handled with a lack of comedic flair. The gunfight scene between Cary Grant and the gangsters is tense, but the ending lacks thoroughness. Only the final scene is handled reasonably well.</p>
<p>Cary Grant is not as satisfactory as one might expect, and Laraine Day is unremarkable.</p>
<p>Freaks' Carnival</p>
<p>There are small gimmicks in the cinematography. Kenny Baker's farcical acting is commendable. However, directorially, there is no great success. The new lead actress, Veenna Marie, is very ordinary.</p>
<p>Desperate Adventure</p>
<p>This is a "Western" that is worth watching. The beginning and end are poor, but the middle part is better. The new actor, Glenn Ford, shows promise, and Evelyn Keyes is also good. The headliner, Randolph Scott, and the second lead, Claire Trevor, are comparatively inferior.</p>
<p>The Desert Song</p>
<p>Dennis Morgan is a failure. The female lead, Irene Manning, is excellent, and her singing voice is also sweet. The director's approach is mediocre, lacking subtlety and heroism. However, the colors are still good, and some effort has been put into the costumes.</p>
<p>New Faces of 1937</p>
<p>The "material women gambling together win" scene is the most successful. The idea of a "Q" is unexpectedly successful and can be called brilliant; the scene of circling in a car is considered one of the best parts in terms of directorial handling. The rest is very ordinary.</p>
<p>However, overall, this film is still a failure. It fails because there is more dialogue than acting, giving it the style of a Chinese "stand-up comedy."</p>
<p>Katharine Hepburn cannot be said to stand out in this film.</p>
<p>Quality Street</p>
<p>The director's handling is too fragmented, and the screenwriter's material is also boring. With such a lineup performing so poorly, it is expected, because Linda Darnell was in decline in Hollywood when she starred in this film. She has no achievements in this film either. Besides being prettier than other actresses, she has no unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Maytime</p>
<p>Jeanette MacDonald has lost her former charm, perhaps because the director did not study her thoroughly. The screenwriter's lines are also very perfunctory and ineffective.</p>
<p>The film is not a top-notch comedy, but it does not create laughable farce either. The stage scenes seem like a small foot trying to fill a large shoe, unable to take big steps. Even the final theme song and dance are not done well.</p>
<p>Actors</p>
<p>The best actors of the week are:</p>
<p>(1) Paul Muni (2) Glenn Ford (3) Kenny Baker (4) Evelyn Keyes (5) Irene Manning.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Sketches of Society</h3>
<p>— Xie Zi</p>
<p>An old Russian woman was walking alone on the road; she was wearing a gold-embroidered silk dress stained with oil, topped with a snuff-colored jacket. Her withered yellow hair was twisted into a bun with a ribbon, tightly held at the back of her head, appearing stiff and inflexible, lacking any lively charm. She carried with her an air of suffocation and heavy snuff odor, and was carrying a net bag filled with odds and ends. Several children were kicking a ball on the road, and the ball hit her net bag. She glared at them fiercely, but quickly returned to her original calm. She was neither thinking nor dreaming; her eyes were dull and lifeless, like a cloud-covered sky, perhaps even darker. She was old, and a long string of years—from bright to gray, from gray to even grayer—was all the same to her. This leisurely and lively evening world was irrelevant to her. She only hoped to go home quickly, throw the net bag down, and sit on the bed to rest her feet.</p>
<p>She staggered away like that. The group of children kicking the ball also chased after their ball, jumping and running into an alley.</p>
<p>This alley was very secluded and deep, with fences on both sides of the alley entrance, covered with messy climbing vines, looking like the quiet residence of a secluded building. A woman in her thirties, with her hands behind her back, was standing there, dressed in a bright green Western suit, not beautiful at all, but with a smug air. She was chatting with a fruit vendor, and several other nannies and old women were also participating in their conversation—a group of women gathered together, chatting aimlessly. The sound of their voices was very lively, with such rising and falling tones, just like the chirping of sparrows in the woods, clear and audible. If a foreigner were here, they should come to appreciate their soft Wu dialect; however, most of the people living here were used to it and did not find it strange. Instead, the crying of a child outside the alley attracted the attention of many people. This child, for some reason, fell to the ground on his back, and his exaggerated crying immediately alarmed his nanny, who ran over and coaxed him, leading him to a stinky tofu vendor and buying him a piece of stinky tofu to eat. The child took the stinky tofu and stopped crying, starting to eat it happily, with bright red chili sauce smeared all over his mouth. The nanny did not pay attention; she seemed to be lost in thought again, her eyes deliberately and unintentionally looking at the pedestrians on the road. She might be thinking about her husband, that useless and unsuccessful husband. She had already married him and had children for him, and she still had to come out and work as a nanny for others. Thinking about it, it was truly unfair.</p>
<p>She leaned against a sycamore tree and sighed softly. Behind the sycamore tree was a Russian deli. The low and dark house was filled with all kinds of pickles. The display window was also particularly small, filled with canned food, chili sauce, ketchup, and other things. Two Russians were sitting in the store, gloomy, damp, and greasy, looking like the pitiful faces of a declining nation. Next to the deli was a hardware store. The display window was larger, of course, with hammers, drills, nails, copper pots, and so on, yellow brass and white iron contrasting each other. A young shop assistant stood at the door reading a newspaper, his face cold and expressionless, just like the hardware items displayed in the window. Past the hardware store was a pale white light, looking gloomy and a bit cold. It turned out to be a fluorescent lamp. The display window of the electrical supply store had its own characteristics, filled with light bulbs, lampshades, light sockets, light fixtures, and even radios. The fat and white light bulbs, the thin and black wires, were all covered in that incurable paleness. There was no one inside the store. An electrician in full work clothes and an apprentice were standing at the store entrance, admiring the display window. It was a photo studio, with various photos displayed in red light; the majesty of generals, the beauty of girls, the kindness of old men, all mixed together. One photo was particularly eye-catching, a picture of a Russian girl's eyes. This photo undoubtedly added much color to this window, this store, and even this street; it was a dazzling and spicy beauty, and it was clear that this was the solid beauty peculiar to Russian girls, not British. The electrician and the apprentice were whispering there, and he was certainly talking about the girl. He himself planned to go to that photo studio to take a picture, taken smartly and upright, and put it together with the Russian girl's beautiful photo. Ah, this is truly a luxurious dream—</p>
<p>Luxurious? He wants to go even further! He thinks that the Russian girl will be greatly moved when she sees his photo. One day she will walk into the photo studio and ask the shop owner, "Who is this handsome young man?" Then he, the electrician, will walk gracefully to her, bow deeply, and in each other's gaze, they will recognize that the other is the hero and beauty in the photo. Then they will fall in love with each other, and maybe they will get married... Ah, this is an even more absurd dream—</p>
<p>Absurd? In Shanghai, people of any status are qualified to have this kind of absurd dream. Who can predict? Maybe one day he will get an unexpected fortune, or he will get rich by doing electrical supply business; or else, he will get her fortune because he married that girl. At that time, who would not envy him? He will sit in a car, take his lovely wife, and drive here to take a spin, reminiscing about his hard beginnings, with a proud smile on his face, nodding to his old acquaintances. But he decided not to make further expressions to them, so as not to lose his status; he also did not intend to stay here for a long time. He will drive the car, pass through Avenue Joffre, pass through Avenue Foch, and drive to the bustling racecourse, then park the car at the door of the International Hotel. He will take his beloved wife's arm and walk in with high head and broad steps, ignoring everyone else. In this way, the whole of Shanghai will be under his feet.</p>
<p>The whole of Shanghai under his feet is not surprising; he had climbed up the utility poles to repair electric wires. The poles were forty or fifty feet high. At that time, if not the whole of Shanghai, at least half of Shanghai was under his feet.</p>
<p>Thinking like this, he couldn't help but feel proud. Coincidentally, there was a sugar-roasted chestnut stall not far from him, so he walked over and bought a thousand copper coins worth of finely roasted chestnuts to treat his apprentice little brother.</p>
<p>As soon as he bought them, other people also went to buy them, and so, in a flash, this chestnut stall made five thousand copper coins worth of business.</p>
<p>But the chestnut king standing behind the roasting pot was not grateful to him. He still held an iron shovel, stirring and stirring. The dark red fire shone on his face. He had no smile on his face, nor the absurd dreams of young people. He was old.</p>
<p>A burst of "crackling" chestnut shells fell on the ground. The autumn wind treated them like fallen leaves, blowing them forward. Some fell into the gutter, some fell under the rubber tires of the rickshaw, with a "smack" sound. The life of the chestnut, from flowering to bearing fruit, and the life of the sycamore leaves, from sprouting to new green to yellowish green, ended like this.</p>
<p>Although some leaves had already fallen on the ground, there were still more leaves remaining on the branches. The trees here were originally very lush, and now they had almost become intertwined with branches and leaves. A person standing here could imagine that they were standing in a quiet cave. At the exit of the cave, you could see the vast sky and a faded city street. Faded but still restless, trams and cars came and went, and small motorcycles were "puffing and puffing" out black air, with bustle but no prosperity, with shouting but no joy. Looking at this street, it would remind one of the green-clad woman just seen. It and she both want to use a kind of artificial effort to make up for their ordinariness. But the impression they give is a vulgar flaunting.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a rickshaw came out of this green cave. A person was sitting in the rickshaw, holding two steam oil lamps in his hand—two strange lemon yellows. Everyone felt strange; it was not dark yet, why light the lamps? The person sitting in the car, however, had a nonchalant look on his face. This rickshaw had to continue to pass through many roads—the shouting and lively roads, the poetic roads, the very urban roads, and even the rugged and uneven cobblestone roads, and finally maybe stop in a small alley. Then, these two lemon yellows that had once made passers-by turn their heads would be considered to have arrived home and began to hide their brilliance, to live their small and even smaller lives.</p>
<p>In fact, all the pedestrians on the road will have to return home to live their small and even smaller lives, but, pitifully, they don't even have these two lemon yellows that make people turn their heads!</p>
<h3>Jialing River (Woodcut)</h3>
<p>— Liu Xian</p>
<h3>Silence</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>I understand how to think, but I don't understand how to live.</p>
<p>Ideals are so high that they hang in the clouds, while reality is trampled in darkness and disorder. When a torch falls into a pool of water, with a splash, everything is over. When ideals are crushed into the abyss of despair, what more can there be?</p>
<p>Who wants to approach a filthy demon? But when it forces itself on you, what do you have in your life to resist it? Everyone wants to enshrine their soul as sacred, rejecting the temptation of evil, but when they think of these, they can't help but tremble.</p>
<p>Like a weak cry in the wilderness, my protest is only silent. The anger in my heart has already become numb. Raise my head, straighten my chest, I know, but in a low-pressure environment, perhaps yielding is more appropriate.</p>
<p>Standing before my own judgment, I am honest; the surging tide cannot devour my tenacious soul; but in these piles of sins, what can be used to wash them away? I often have to dress myself as experienced and brave, but what is hidden is only naivety and fragility.</p>
<p>I want to shout, and I don't want to shout. Understanding how to think, thinking makes me suffer. Not understanding how to live, life brings me setbacks everywhere. —— I quietly sealed my mouth shut.</p>
<h3>Window</h3>
<p>— Yi Tao</p>
<p>I still live in that tent that was once built in a cold mountain city, and the tent is still built on a square in the suburbs. So I still face a self-made screen window, and the screen window still faces the far end of the open space.</p>
<p>Although my journey is so complex and varied, when I stop my steps and rest in a place where I can rest, my heart is as quiet as a pond of spring water. So I repeatedly build my little cloth house and spend a long day in the small room. In these days, I live helplessly, like a prisoner who cannot get freedom. My heart leads my wings to be bound by a kind of drowsiness, and I cannot get rid of the torture of shackles for a long time. So I can only face the window, depicting many past events or future prospects, and the past is a group of gray and white dew, and the future is like colorful morning glow, which is so insignificant and irrelevant to my own life.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly waited at the window, perhaps in the golden morning or in the gloomy dusk, like those days of flying rain and snow. I wait for a child's shadow, as if her shadow is frozen, like a traveler despairing on the riverbank of a broken bridge. My strings are broken, and I never hear their faint sound. If the sun never wants to set out to shine on our earth, her shadow will never thaw, never flow to my window. So I angrily jump out of the window, letting the rain ravage my limbs. I walked to the shadow, and she was by the warm stove, giving me a contemptuous shallow smile. …</p>
<p>My determination no longer allows me to remember these things. Moreover, I am far away from that shadow in the north and south of the sky. But precisely because today I am facing the window, the revelation of the window asks me to go back and visit that rugged mountain journey.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it is no longer the season of flying snowflakes, and the people I looked forward to in the past have also lost their news. What appears outside the window at this moment is the earth burned by the sun's fire, and the season when pomegranate flowers are red and green grass is growing strongly. Therefore, I will never close the curtains, close my eyes, and meditate on a past event. Instead, I let the sun come in, let the wind come in, if my window has shadows, I will run out and run to the distance in the sunny ground. …</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 74</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Hu Di knew that some of the people traveling with him looked down on him, perhaps jealous of his small achievements, so he had to proceed alone, capturing several rebellious men and women, interrogating them, taking some licenses and scattered documents, and writing this note for me behind people's backs. Hu Di did not read much. Usually, writing a family letter, he inevitably makes some spelling mistakes, but it would never be as bad as this note, written so poorly. Presumably, he was a little angry at the time, and panicked, so he made many spelling mistakes, and the sentences were incoherent. However, I felt that from now on, his literary education should be given special attention. This is an important task that I consciously "cannot shirk."</p>
<p>After reading the note and finding out the causes and consequences, I was pondering when another messenger from Hu Di rushed here, saying that he had inquired in several places before finding this place. "Xiao Hucheng, the deputy team leader, is missing!" He also said that the action team leader already knew and was waiting for me to return to headquarters to talk.</p>
<p>Logically, I should immediately return to the headquarters, report everything, and discuss a solution, either I would be responsible for forcing Hu Di to return, or the team leader would propose a method to search and suppress Shuanglongjian. But these first and second points are difficult to do. Even if they are done, Hu Di will no longer trust me; and even worse, he will lose his temper and run away. Publicly and privately, I will have some difficulty explaining.</p>
<p>To be honest, I also intend to venture into Shuanglongjian. Now that Yin Ni is hiding there, he is the source of the trouble. If there is an opportunity, a bullet can send him to hell. If I report it, with Shuanglongjian's kind of equipment, I am afraid that all our strength, including the reorganized security team and the 12th Regiment, will be sent to encircle and suppress it, but it may not be successful. If it is not done well, we will suffer sacrifices in vain. Moreover, can we mobilize all our strength at this time to do this relatively less urgent work?</p>
<p>After I made up my mind, I ordered the two messengers to wait here for a while, and when my messengers arrived, they would return to the headquarters together. I would take a step first. After saying these words, I also notified the commissioner in charge of arresting rebels, and rushed to the original parking place. The two cars were still parked there well. After asking the driver's service, I knew that Hu Di had not come to ask for the car. I knew that Hu Di could not drive and did not want the service to know his whereabouts, so he probably hired a car or thought of another way to leave. Anyway, it was only about ten miles to Sister Cui's place.</p>
<p>Immediately, I ordered the service to leave a car and asked two people to drive one back, saying that I had a small matter to deal with and could return to the headquarters in ten minutes, asking them to report it first. I used this method to transfer the two of them away so that I could act freely.</p>
<p>After the two left, I checked the fuel gauge and saw that it was still full. Fearing that the team leader would send someone to find me, I got in the car and circled around a few streets in the city, and then drove towards Shuangqiao. After leaving the city, passing our own outermost sentry post, I slightly changed my dress, added some makeup to my face, removed the temporary armband, and checked the pistol's magazine; it was a new German-style twenty-round pistol. To be careful, when the car entered the truly unmanned and unguarded area, I got out of the car and re-examined it, eliminating all traces of official business in the car. However, I was very strange, why on this highway, for a long section, there was not only no trace of people, but also no sentry patrols on either side.</p>
<p>After walking another section, I came to a fork in the road, still not seeing anyone. I suddenly noticed that on that fork road, the soil was loose and there were many messy ruts, so I stopped the car by the side of the road, got out of the car, and carefully examined these tracks. After examining twenty or thirty yards to the north and south, I found traces of light and heavy tanks, armored vehicles, and various sizes of wheels. These tracks were all a little to the left, knowing that it was a march going south. "Which mechanized unit is this from?" I repeatedly asked myself. Because at that time, I did not know that this was a branch road that went north directly to Shuanglongjian and south directly to the Pingjin Highway.</p>

<h3>Fragmented Words Under a Dim Lamp</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The Chengdu City Council nearly came to blows over the issue of lifting the ban on dancing. Among the most brilliant remarks was a few angry words from those who supported lifting the ban:</p>
<p>"Good! In the future, if any sister or girl has problems because of secretly dancing, don't cry for leniency!"</p>
<p>Those who have been to Sichuan can appreciate the intonation when these words are spoken.</p>
<p>In fact, it is better to be open and aboveboard than to be secretive. Openness is better than secrecy, and besides, dancing is not a crime.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a postman who often delivers letters came to my house to sell matches. Before I could ask, he said:</p>
<p>"Sir! I'm really ashamed, my family of several people is difficult to support. I have no choice but to sell some small items to supplement my household."</p>
<p>The matches were not more expensive than those on the market, so I was happy to accept them. At the same time, I also respect such people, at least they are seeking profit from capital and supporting themselves.</p>
<h3>The Pujiang Bridge: Expanding Urban Construction</h3>
<p>The area of Shanghai is not limited to the former two concessions. It possesses an area ten times larger. However, the bustling areas are confined to the smaller circle. This has led to a housing shortage, with a house costing a hundred taels of gold, and renting an office space costing several gold bars. As for the roads, there are more people than ants, and the traffic is constant. Despite implementing one-way traffic, the congestion remains unchanged.</p>
<p>"Expanding the urban area" should be the call for the future! Previously, the Yangjingbang Creek hindered the north-south market, but it was filled. The Suzhou Creek also has various bridges connecting the north and south banks. Human effort can overcome everything. Within the country, haven't there already been three bridges spanning the Yellow River? Abroad, the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco was built ten years ago and is still considered a famous engineering marvel in the world.</p>
<p>So, why is the Huangpu River still a separate world? Everyone is thinking that if there were a bridge across the Huangpu River, wouldn't the prosperity of Puxi (Shanghai west of the Huangpu River) immediately reach Pudong (Shanghai east of the Huangpu River)? The lack of municipal funding is one reason. In addition, although the river is small, the ships that travel on it are quite large, which is also a very important factor.</p>
<p>A flat bridge like the Sichuan Road Bridge or the Waibaidu Bridge is indeed impossible to build over the Huangpu River, except at the southern end of the Pujiang River. The only solution is to build a tunnel or use an active bridge. According to the design of the China Bridge Company, assuming a double-opening active bridge, the clearance under the bridge is ten meters above the highest water level, the bridge width is twelve meters, plus sidewalks, three meters on each side, for a total width of eighteen meters, a slope of four percent, and a clear height of six meters inside the bridge. If this bridge is built according to the above figures, it would be an ordinary bridge, but even medium-sized ships would have difficulty passing through, especially those with flagpoles, chimneys, and observation platforms. Therefore, using a double-opening active design can avoid this.</p>
<p>However, after the bridge is opened, the presence of cars and trams on the bridge will have an impact. Therefore, in theory, the bridge can be raised, while the slope will still be around four percent. If designed this way, the slope will extend to the vicinity of Xizang Road, making the project even more immense.</p>
<p>If a tunnel is used, the slope would be four or five percent, the clear height four and a quarter meters, and the width, according to regulations, only six meters. This is only equivalent to the two sidewalks of an active bridge, and it is also too narrow and not very practical.</p>
<p>Although the above is all speculation and casual talk, if it is to be put into practice, I really don't know how much money it will cost, how much manpower it will take, and how much time it will require; but, can you say that this is impossible?</p>
<h3>Nothing More Than That</h3>
<p>— W·W</p>
<p>Having paid the fees, what are you afraid of, teacher? At worst, don't come next semester. If I'm not welcome here, there are other places that will welcome me. "Warning," "Major Demerit," etc., nothing more than that.</p>
<p>Suppress him. Eliminate the black market? The black market turns into a white market, and the white market turns back into a black market! Simply abolish price controls. Black and white are indistinguishable, in fact, it's hard to separate them. Severe punishment, etc., just a scare, nothing more than that.</p>
<p>Intensify the capture of pickpockets, and pickpocketing work intensifies. "Matching wits with a worthy opponent!" At worst, a few slaps, a few days of free meals, a round of reprimands, three flavors, nothing more than that.</p>
<p>"By order, smoking is prohibited within the premises," the thunder belongs to enforcement, but the smoke dissipates. Before long, they are again swallowing clouds and spitting mist. "By order, eliminate street vendors," the wind howls and the cranes cry. Perhaps it concerns taxes. In a few days, they are again everywhere. By order, eliminate, etc., nothing more than that.</p>
<p>From reporting corruption to strict investigation, from executing the investigation to stopping at the right time, it's as if it happened just yesterday and the day before, and now it's completed. Such a broad matter, to get to the bottom of it, is as easy as turning your hand, nothing more than that.</p>
<p>Suddenly being hungry for a meal is really unbearable; being used to being hungry is nothing more than that. Living with a lot of money and dying with empty hands, so what? Nothing more than that?</p>
<h3>History and Geography</h3>
<p>— Jianhua</p>
<p>According to reports, the Shanghai World Geography Society published "Map of the New World Situation," in which the content is full of errors, such as still considering Taiwan and Korea as Japanese territory. Isn't this extremely absurd!</p>
<p>Recently, the failure of history and geography education in our country has gradually been recognized by the academic community. There have been many instances of humorous stories about history and geography examinations published in newspapers and magazines: such as Qin Shi Huang being born after Emperor Wu of Han, Yuan Shikai being the emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Huizhou being the capital of Anhui Province, Chifeng being a small island in Japan, and even more than half of the four thousand exam papers from the first year of high school not knowing in which year of the Republic the "September 18th Incident" occurred. These strange stories are truly amazing, making people laugh and cry. Not to mention the books from the past eight or nine years, most of the newly published middle school history and geography textbooks are still copied from old ones, pieced together. Some have books but no maps, some have books and maps that don't match, and some are even as absurd as the "Map of the New World Situation," which not only misleads young people but also concerns the national system.</p>
<p>However, schools at all levels now not valuing history and geography teaching also bear a great responsibility. When students are in class, the room is bare except for the blackboard, desks, and chairs. Teachers lecture and gesture, going through the motions. Students read novels, write love letters, and chat casually. How can they get good grades this way!</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that public and private primary and secondary schools, having collected many tuition fees this semester, should prepare more charts related to history and geography (the Education Bureau stipulates that office expenses account for 20% to 30% of tuition fees). Don't let students sit empty in the classroom, clueless. Teachers should also not spend time on salary increase petitions, but should pay attention to preparing teaching materials, and stop misleading students.</p>
<h3>The Question of Attitude</h3>
<p>— Shengjie</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people in society.</p>
<p>When taking the tram, if you take a bad ticket or buy a ticket with a corner missing, the ticket seller is likely to say, "Do you have eyes?" Then your response is even more fierce, leading to unpleasantness. If the ticket seller changes his approach and says, "Sir! Please change your ticket, okay!" Your feeling is completely different from the former.</p>
<p>Walking on the street or taking the train, car, or tram, when you are smoking a cigarette, a friend next to you borrows fire without your permission and immediately takes your cigarette to light his, or he says "Light one" to you, and before you have a chance to answer, he takes your cigarette while saying it. This is one type of person. There is another type of person who never borrows fire from others if he doesn't have fire, or politely asks you to borrow fire, saying, "Please lend me a light." After speaking, he remains silent and waits for you to agree to hand him the cigarette before taking the fire. These two types of people need the same thing, but their attitudes are very different.</p>
<p>Of course, a person who is outwardly humble may not be honest, but this is not a reason for you to be arrogant to others! The same sentence, due to the difference in tone and attitude, often has a difference of thousands of miles. Kindness and courtesy are always essential elements in group living!</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Military</h3>
<p>— Translated by Huaiyuan</p>
<p>Private Johnson, after marrying his childhood sweetheart, was granted two weeks of leave for his honeymoon. His leave of absence was soon to expire and he wired his commanding officer to ask for an extension, saying, "This place is too wonderful, requesting your permission for another week of leave."</p>
<p>The commanding officer's reply was also humorous: "This place is also very wonderful, return to camp immediately."</p>
<p>During the war, American newspapers often reported on the romances between American pilots and charming Australian girls. Later, an American girl wrote to her lover in Australia and asked, "Australian girls are so attractive to you, what do they have that we don't have?"</p>
<p>"They have everything you have," her lover replied, "but theirs is all right here."</p>
<p>Officer: "Idiot, you gave me the wrong pair of boots. Can't you see one is black and the other is yellow?"</p>
<p>Orderly: "Yes, but I have to report to the officer that your other pair of boots is also like that (one black and one yellow)."</p>
<p>A recruit is being examined by a doctor. The doctor asked him, "Can you see anything without your glasses?"</p>
<p>"Without my glasses," the recruit replied, "I can't even hear."</p>

<h3>Acting Smart</h3>
<p>— Yinyuan, translated from the October issue of "Crown" magazine</p>
<p>The child came home from school with a lot of knowledge. His father was reading the newspaper, but the child was determined to show off his knowledge. "Hey, Dad," he began, "did you know that in some parts of India, a man never sees his wife until he gets married?"</p>
<p>His father replied without surprise, "That's how it was with me and your mother, my good boy."</p>
<p>"I absolutely don't want this room," an old woman declared to the clerk. "I won't pay a high rent to live in a back room with a folded bed. If you think I just came from the country, then you..."</p>
<p>"Go in, Madam, just go in," the clerk impatiently reminded her. "This is not a room, it's an elevator."</p>
<h3>Sunday Miscellany: Regarding a Year of Thirteen Months</h3>
<p>(Editor's Note: This issue was originally scheduled to be discussed in the next "Sunday Miscellany." Due to the large number of submissions received, we will begin this week. The next miscellany will still be on this issue. Readers are welcome to contribute their opinions!)</p>
<h3>Worth a Try</h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>If it weren't for the frequent wars in recent years, calendar reform would have had a decent achievement long ago.</p>
<p>In 1933, the League of Nations General Assembly discussed the calendar, and there were many discussions. Representatives from various countries raised as many as 185 points of dissatisfaction with the current calendar - the Gregorian calendar (i.e., the solar calendar).</p>
<p>At the same time, the inability to unify the calendars of various countries also caused a lot of unnecessary trouble. Someone once joked, saying: "If someone likes to join in the fun, they can celebrate the New Year three times in one year. The first New Year (solar calendar) can be spent safely in London or New York, then rush to the Balkan Peninsula to spend another one (Julian calendar - followed by the Slavic people), and finally take a plane back to China to spend another one (lunar calendar)."</p>
<p>Mr. Duzui re-raised the reformed calendar of thirteen months a year in "Freedom Talk". This calendar was proposed by a man named Posltivist, so it is called the Posltivist calendar. There are thirteen months a year, twenty-eight days a month. The newly added month is added in the middle of June and July, named "Sol." An extra day is added at the end of the year, and one day is added at the end of June every four years, which is considered a leap year. This calendar is good, but it commits a great taboo. Look! Thirteen months a year, the number thirteen is very ominous, not to mention that the thirteenth of every month is Friday.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a new calendar called the "World Calendar," which divides the year into four "quarters," each quarter three months, one large month of thirty-one days, and two small months of thirty days, for a total of thirteen weeks in each quarter. Each quarter begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday. A Saturday is added at the end of the year, called the "Year End Day." One day is added every four years between June and July, called the "Leap Day."</p>
<p>Before World War II, the "World Calendar" aroused everyone's interest. Fourteen countries decided to try it at the end of 1939 or 1944, but 1939 to 1944 were spent in the midst of war, and people's minds were filled with airplanes, cannons, submarines, and tanks. Where was there time to reform the calendar?</p>
<p>Now, let's try it!</p>
<h3>Doesn't Make Sense</h3>
<p>— Jin Xieshan</p>
<p>The usefulness of a calendar is to help people's memory. Anyone who forgets what day it is today can look at the calendar and recall the memory. It really has nothing to do with fixing thirteen months a year and twenty-eight days a month. Otherwise, February in the solar calendar is twenty-eight days, and July and August have thirty-one days, which are all fixed every year. If it is because of the fixed nature that we don't need to use a calendar, then can't we not use a calendar now?</p>
<p>There is really no need to change the new calendar to a "scientific calendar." Of course, I wouldn't oppose a reasonable reform. However, I feel that we need to live more lively lives. Anything that becomes rigid and fixed will become boring. We certainly need neatness and order, but we sometimes also need to cater to nature and liveliness. Our ten fingers are not neatly arranged, and although they don't make us feel ugly, if someone thinks they are tired of looking at them and must change them to be all the same length, even if it is possible, I don't think it will necessarily make our work more convenient!</p>
<h3>New Suggestions</h3>
<p>— Yang Lansheng</p>
<p>I vaguely remember that before the War of Resistance Against Japan, world calendar experts published the so-called scientific calendar, stipulating that the year should be divided into thirteen months, each month four weeks, a total of twenty-eight days, and one day at the end of the year on New Year's Eve was named "a happy day," and two days in leap years.</p>
<p>"Freedom Talk" today is especially asking everyone to consider and contribute opinions on the thirteen months a year. This matter seems unimportant, but in fact, the world's calendar, weeks, and seasons cannot cooperate closely, and the months, days, and weeks are out of sync. Especially in our country, the yin and yang calendars are both disobeying and weird. It is indeed a great regret! If it is changed to a scientific calendar in the future, the weeks, months, and days will have fixed rules to follow, which will be of great convenience to social life!</p>
<p>I admit that the scientific calendar is successful in two points: First, the first day of each month is Monday or Tuesday, and the extra day outside of the fifty-two weeks of the year is listed as a "happy day." But there are also shortcomings. The biggest shortcoming is that thirteen months a year destroys the order of the four seasons of the year and loses the original meaning of science, so we don't need to strictly maintain the scientific calendar. The original year (four seasons and twelve months) should not be changed arbitrarily!</p>
<p>My opinion: A year can be divided into four seasons and twelve months, each three months being thirteen weeks, of which two months are four weeks and one month is five weeks. What needs to be studied now is whether the extra week should be placed in the first month? Or in the second or third month? In fact, any month will do.</p>
<h3>Official Hospital</h3>
<p>— Doctor</p>
<p>Words from a doctor: This New Year, we are thinking. The × Hospital was established, and I joined this well-equipped × Hospital (formerly a famous Japanese × Hospital). The medicines, equipment, food, and all necessary items inside were all available (there were as many as five ×-ray machines), enough for ten years of use; from this, we can see the general ambition of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Now, the remaining medicines are used as they are, and the equipment is damaged piece by piece, with no way to replenish them. No one cares. Even gauze bandages, which can be washed, disinfected, and reused after use, are thrown away after being used once. Why is this done? The reason is that the treatment is too poor, the management is lacking, and people don't work with enthusiasm. Everyone has the attitude of just getting through the day.</p>
<p>Speaking of treatment, it is even more pitiful. When this hospital first opened its doors in February this year, everyone thought that after years of resistance, the whole of China had received a lot of lessons and should be properly reformed to reach a truly bright path. Therefore, at that time, the doctors, nurses, and tea servants in all departments were very neat and energetic. Until four or five months later, the treatment was so little that the average doctor's monthly salary was 70,000 yuan, the nurse's was 40,000, and the tea servant's was 5,000, while the prices outside were changing drastically every day. The director always said that he would increase it several times next month to retain people, but the result was still a pie in the sky, unable to satisfy hunger. Until now, the average doctor's monthly salary is 100,000 yuan, the nurse's is 70,000 yuan, and the tea servant's is 20,000 yuan. The director still says he will increase it, but even doubling it will not work. What use are these few dollars?</p>
<p>As for the food, not to mention, there are only canned fish and beef left by the Japanese, which are really worthless in nutrition, simply like eating old dry grass, but they are available every day, every meal. We have been eating it for nine months, and we are still eating it now. I think we will have to eat it in the future. The rest is smelly fish, old clover, and half-cooked onions; the soup is just boiled water with some salt, and oil has never been seen at all. The rice is either brown or yellow and smelly. If you want to eat it, it's like this, if you don't want to eat it, it's like this. Now everyone is pale and thin. If this continues, I guarantee that everyone will get tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Because the treatment is driving people to their deaths and there is no way to survive, many doctors and nurses have left. Such a large hospital, with almost a hundred beds, is full every day, but there are only five doctors and nine nurses, so the work is quite busy. Sometimes, there is also a physical examination for soldiers going abroad, thirty to fifty every day, and they have to be examined within a limited number of days. It is really as Mr. Lu Xun said: "We are cows, eating grass, and squeezing out milk."</p>
<p>I just don't understand, do the officials have parents, wives, and children? How do you support them? Is your monthly salary also 100,000 yuan? Why should you live in foreign houses, drive cars, and eat fish and meat?</p>
<p>When we doctors really have no way to survive, the most we can do is quit, but I hope you officials will use your brains and think of ways to reform! I believe that this situation is not only in our hospital, but every state agency is the same, and everyone who receives military treatment has the same feeling. But they are smiling wryly while crying!</p>
