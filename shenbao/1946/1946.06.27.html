<h3>三人會議昨今繼續休會　研究中共整軍對案　馬帥昨分別與俞周晤談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕三人會議今日繼續休會一日，因馬歇爾特使鑒於過去之經騐，認為凡重大而複雜之問題，如事前未能作充分準備、則開會不僅徒費唇舌，且足影響會議時各方之情緒，而坐失稍縱即逝之良機。惟昨日深夜，馬使發出通知時，僅定休會一日，今因美方及政府代我對中共今日提出之整軍對案，尚須作縝密研究。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿大日電〕軍事三人會議定明日繼續休會一日，周恩來定明日上午十一時往訪馬歇爾，又據聞整軍間題之遲未討論，乃因中共方面之對案尚未提出。現悉中共之對案業已擬定，並於今日下午送交馬歇爾。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕周恩來今日下午自二時起至下午六時止，均在馬使行館中商討整軍問題，今晚馬使會接見俞交長，有所洽談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕民盟代表張申府·章伯鈞·沈鈞儒·梁漱溟·黃炎培·羅隆基今晚九時赴梅園新村聽取中共八路軍副參謀總長滕代遠報告關於軍事方面之情形，是時梅園新村門省街燈如晦，行人寥寥，十餘記者均於黯淡之燈光下守候此一新聞，迄十一時止，尚未完畢。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕第三方面代表，今日午彼三時，在鳳頤村舉行內部商談，談話結果，有意見兩點：（一）認為和平前途正面臨嚴重關頭，希望和平成功，不願多生枝節，以免影響和平，（二）盼中共對整軍之對案，早日提出，以便整軍會議趕快舉行。此兩點意見，前者由各代表分別轉達，後者則由梁漱溟今夜赴梅園新村轉達。又第三方面明日下午，將再有一內部之商談。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京廿六日電〕今晚據可靠方面消息：關於三人小組，執行總部與執行小組中美方代表之權力問題，前曾發生激烈爭辯，刻已獲致諒解。在和平談判中最困難問題之一獲得解決之後，各代表即可集中其全力討論軍隊整編問題。據悉：共產黨代表團對於整編問題，已提出建議，請國民政府考慮，此等建議，係由周恩來於今日下午二時三十分親自交與馬歇爾將軍。周恩來與馬使密談幾達三小時之久。並悉，渠將於明日上午九時再與馬使會晤。關於中國和平調處機構中美方代表權力之諒解，其詳情如何，目下尚無所知，但消息靈通人士認為此項諒解，大部份根據共方建議，即美方代表有權提出獨立報告，進行調查，並執行三人小組之決議，三人小組決議必須一致同意一點，依然予以保持。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿六日電〕新民報今日戰稱：國共雙方對於蔣主席六月六日停戰令中三項問題之末一項，即軍隊整軍駐軍問題，均願相讓，國府方面準備在進駐各區讓步，中共方面則願意在二月二十五日協定各點退讓，唯要求在東北擴大共軍比數，其理由為東北「民主聯軍」人數甚多，原來雙方商妥之東北駐軍數為共軍三師，國軍十五師，現共軍要求增加兩師。三人軍事小組「因雙方意見仍懸殊」，今日並未會議。</p>
<h3>彭部長答外記者問　希望某些方面　放棄煽動政策　關於整軍等方案主席曾再三修正</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕廿六日下午四時半，中宣部舉行外記者招待會，由彭部長及外交部劉次長主持，茲記其重要問答如下：</p>
<p>（問）上星期夜間，下關車站請願代表被毆時，若干外記者曾在塲目擊，歷時數小時之久，軍警並未盡力保護，似若有人指使，此事應由何人負責？</p>
<p>（彭部長答）政府對於下關鬥毆事件，甚表惋惜，此種暴行，決難寬恕，警察對於雙方在車站辯論責駡，至數小時之久，未能及早解散，至鬥毆發生，又未能及時制止，雖謂本市警力單薄。又缺乏運輪工具，難於迅速調動，但保護不力，難辭其咎，政府已將槪管警察所長撤職，並將首都警察廳長申城，鬥毆發生後不久，大批憲警趕到，驅散羣衆，救出負傷者，吾人對於負傷者，十分同情，對於暴動者，十分憤嫉，但對於同日在上海發生之同類事件，不能不順便提及，當請願代表離滬之際，有數千示威運動者，到站送行，歸途經過靑年會，竟闖入宿舍，提捕反共學生數人，於毆打及撕毀衣服之外，並於其背上，用黑漆大書侮辱文字，綁縛遊行，在附近公園，舉行所謂民眾審判，此數學生，亦於最危險時間為同樣遲到之憲警所救出，此事件恰巧發生於下關事件之前數小時，對於和平代表等背後所代表之和平與人權保障，投一諷刺之照明，余十分懇切希望某些方面，放棄此類陰慘之策略，勿煽動可愛之靑年，將不明外間情祝之老年人，套入民眾運動之光頭，以造成宣傳之慘案，吾人略有所聞，同類之煽動，正在積極進行，吾人亦欲請願於背後牽綫之諧公，至少從人道主義觀點，重新考慮此種計劃。</p>
<p>（問）中宣部稱羣眾為蘇北難民，如謂屬實，何以證明？暴行者究已逮捕若干人？其姓各籍貫為何？難民究竟是否如當日之羣眾頗有組織？</p>
<p>（彭部長答）蘇北難民羣居於下關車站附近者數萬故附近居民極易辯識，暴行嫌疑者八人被捕，其中二人已證明無辜被釋，另有二人名成瓊與陳錫輸者，證明為參加暴行之人，將受依法之懲罰，如君等有暇可往探視，正在暴行發生之數日前，蘇北難民等正在發起組織協會，該會已於廿四目成立，昨日請願代表招待記者會中，難民協會並曾對請願代表正式道歉，為諸君之所目覩。</p>
<p>（問）六月廿九日以前，最後協定應希望達到如何程度？聞主席已修正其關於共方撤退某某區域之要求，可否請加說明？</p>
<p>（彭部長答）主席在停止前進命令中，所指示之三點，即停止衝突，恢復交通，整編軍隊，必須於月底以前求得確切之解決，主席曾再三修正其方案，以遷就共方之要求，在此階段，詳情尙不能發表。</p>
<h3>紀念主席豐功　渝南岸黃山改名中正山</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿五日電〕渝市甫岸黃山為蔣主席在渝時官邸所在地前渝臨參會為紀念主席豐功偉績，曾請市府將黃山更名為中正山，頃市府獲政院會核准，特正式宣佈，自即日起正式更名。</p>
<h3>共黨鉅款七億元先後由平運漢口</h3>
<p>〔中央社漢口廿五電〕共黨六月內先後由平運漢欵項達七萬萬元正，計第一批三萬萬元，第二批四萬萬元，聞該款業經由第九小組轉請行營派專軍送宣化店。</p>
<h3>全國人口統計四億七千餘萬</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京二十六日電〕內政部今日發表：據最近統計，全國人口總計約四七〇·〇二六·二五二人，包括台灣省六百萬人在內，海外僑胞則除外。</p>
<h3>美國務院重申在華美軍任務　目的在助我遣送日軍</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿五日電〕美國務院發言人，重申在華美軍之任務，係應中國政府之要求，用以協助遣送在華日軍者，美軍在華之惟一目的，亦即在此，蓋前據南京訊，毛澤東曾要求美國立即停止對中國政府之一切軍事援助，並撤回駐華美軍，故發表上述聲明。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕美軍司令部在華之工作範圍，漸見縮小，故美軍司令部人負亦隨之減少，在本年七月，人數將更減低，美軍司令部參謀長麥特斯將軍，已定於七月四日離滬返美，總司令吉倫將軍則仍留此，美軍在滬之空軍司令部，現已取消，空軍司令伊文斯將軍，己於日前離滬返國，該部縮小範圍，改為空軍部，主理空中交通事宜，由麥克雷諾斯任司令。</p>
<h3>蕢延芳等昨赴國府　晉謁吳文官長　陳述此行目的吳氏允轉達主席蕢語記者對中共行徑已有認識</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕上海來京代表蕢延芳等，今日下午三時，曾赴國府晉謁吳文官長，陳述來京目的，並擬謁見主席旋由吳氏答稱：因主席公忙，未能接見，至代表之意，當代為轉達。又蕢氏等並訪晤馮玉祥氏旋蕢氏等一行赴寗海路拜訪馬歇爾特使。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕自蕢延芳等昨日在此舉行記者招待會之後，京中人士對於上海來此之馬敘倫等八人，已有極清楚之認識，而對蕢氏本人之坦白胸懷，僉表好評。本報記者今日訪蕢氏傾談一切。蕢氏之表示，一如昨日招待會上所談者，惟曾再度聲明，渠等此來乃為祈求和平，下關不幸事件，實出「誤會」，決不願訴諸法律，重苦難民，多生枝節，有遠來京本旨。蕢氏最後並稱：自滬來京，途中由耳聞日擊之難民陳訴中，對於共黨之扈戾行徑，認識更深，如有機會，與中共在京代表相見時，將來直轉告。</p>
<h3>何應欽張嘉璈抵瀋　東北行營有於下月起改為行轅說　蔣經國謀恢復外交接觸</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕東北局勢之轉換，似正在幕後進行。何應欽今晨偕軍調部參謀長蔡文治飛瀋陽，並可能赴長春一行，傳廿九日可南返。何行前極秘密，昨晚其隨員尚稱何不擬赴東北，此次使命，可能相當重大。東北行營有於下月初改為主席行轅說，仍由熊式輝任主任，杜聿明任副主任，萬福麟馬占山等東北耆宿，亦將有相當名義。蔣經國之甫返東北，表示政府正覓取途徑，恢復東北之中蘇正常外交關係，因自蘇軍撤退東北戰事發生後，蘇外交官與一部僑民，亦隨軍撤退，正常外交接觸，即告中斷。此外中長路如何恢復通車，及大連接收問題，當亦為蔣氏所欲解決之問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿五日電〕東北行營經委會主委張嘉璈，廿五日下午三時由瀋飛抵長。據語中央社記者稱：渠廿五日晨十時離瀋，道經四平街，曾着陸視察會晤劉耀東主席，並察看破壞不堪之油廠，勾留凡三小時，渠此次來長，係第三次，將中長路事稍作料理，定廿七日仍返瀋。</p>
<p>東北戰氛仍極濃厚</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕東北軍情：（一）東北戰爭空氣仍濃，據杜聿明電此間有關當局，松花江北岸烏拉街榆樹間，集結共軍騎兵甚多，擬在泡子沿渡口渡河，揚言將進攻永吉九台。（二）官方消息：瀋陽遼陽間之煙合煤礦，廿三日被共軍二百餘人襲擊，附近村民二人被槍殺，熱河之北票煤礦，近亦被炸毀。（三）共軍在東北小規模交通破壞戰，仍時有發生，共軍支隊千餘，一度侵擾新民附近公主屯，廿三日經國軍擊退，已退回康平，錦州至新立屯支綫上之清浸鬥車站，十九日夜亦被共軍襲擊，車站被焚毀，附近電綫橋樑，亦有破壞，路局事後雖已搶修通車，惟共軍仍在附近活動。威脅尚未減除。</p>
<p>熱省共軍調動頻繁</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕廿日前潘陽撫順外圍，雖曾有小衝突，目前則已平靜無事。惟戰神之陰影，則迄未能自白山黑水間根本移去，刻熱河共軍，不斷由察魯兩省增加重兵。官方情報，最近由張家口東凱開河共軍約五千，由山東繞道入熱河者約三萬人，如八日後和平談判破裂，則此等兵力即或為中共再度問鼎東北之新資本。政府方面亦不無準備。惟在任何空氣下美方均不放棄其和平之信念與努力，短促之停戰期，美方人員僕僕風塵，出入槍林彈雨中，已完成若干調處之準備工作。刻廿九小組已出發四平街以東之海籠，卅小組已赴潘陽以南之海城，展開其和平工作。</p>
<h3>希爾上校飛平轉魯　將執行恢復交通　同蒲北段共軍攻陷沙峪</h3>
<p>〔本報甫京廿六日電〕北平軍調部美方交通管理處馬氏顧問希爾上校，偕同北平軍調處交通科共方代表黃逸峯，明晨九時乘機飛平轉赴山東，執行恢復交通事宜。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原廿五日電〕廿四日上午四時共軍第十四團游繫支隊，向同蒲北段沙峪車站猛攻，與守軍激戰二小時，因眾寡懸殊，遂被共軍攻陷。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原廿六日電〕同蒲綫軒崗鑲（㬀縣西南）廿三日下午六時，再為其軍攻陷，該處有著名炭礦，聞機器被共軍運去，發電所及建築物，均破壞無遺。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島廿六日電〕軍息：中共「膠東軍區」際「濱海軍區」向靑島方面進擊，主力達四萬人，膠東萊陽等處有共軍飛機場，曾出動飛機偵察。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿六日電〕此間傳稱中共對於東北交通問題，曾提出二點要求：（一）護路警中共加派一半，（二）路運收入，中共分得其大半。</p>
<p>〔中央社青島廿五日電〕軍悉，即墨近郊共軍吳克華部，廿四日晚十時又向國軍攻擊，展開激戰。</p>
<h3>白魯德病勢減輕</h3>
<p>戴伯爾門在長召開會議</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕軍調部消息：（一）白魯德昨晚病勢已減輕，惟白仍有返美就醫意。（二）棗莊守軍首長王繼美，被共軍俘虜後，業已自殺。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿六日電〕戴伯爾門於昨來長後，今午在三方面人士同樓辦公之中長理事會大樓開會，會議時間極長，惟內容未悉。</p>

<h3>青難民絕食　慰勞國軍</h3>
<p>〔中央社靑島廿五日電〕靑市難民六百餘人，廿五日絕食一餐，以絕食所得，慰勞靑市國軍。</p>
<p>〔中央社靑島廿五日電〕即墨膠縣一帶難民到靑達三萬人，經警備司令部及行總魯青分署安置市郊，辦理急賑。據難民談稱：即墨膠縣被共軍洗劫一空，不及逃避居足，遭受殘害。</p>
<h3>中常會昨日會議通過魏道明任立院副院長　國防委會通過公教人員食米配售辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕中央常務會議，今晨九時在國府舉行，到戴傳賢孫科·白祟禧·潘公展·徐堪·俞鴻鈞·邵力子等，由戴常委傳賢主席，會議歷二小時，曾通過任魏道明為立法院副院長，以補已故葉楚傖之遺缺，中常會散會後，旋舉行國防會議，由孫委員科主席，糧食部徐部長曾報告當前糧食狀況甚詳。</p>

<p>魏道明</p>
<p>我國關稅政策　政府正研究改善　由於各國採取自由貿易政策我不能用關稅壁壘對抗外貨　　〔中央社南京廿六日電〕關於我國現行關稅政策，國人多主張重加老慮，因大量洋貨之進口，各重要市場均有逐漸被壟斷之危險，國貨前途，殊形暗淡，此種增大我國際收支不平衡差額一事，其對於國家經濟之危害甚大。頃據財政當局表示：奢侈品之進口，已嚴令禁止，不必要之洋貨，將設法課以重稅。至現下我國關稅政策，政府進行研究改善，由於各民主國家採取向由貿易政策，處此潮流之中，我國絕不能採用關稅璧壘，以對抗外貨之進口，但為發展我國工業起見，將採取適當之步驟加以保護。</p>

<h3>褚逆民誼獲準再審　檢察官提出抗告　認蘇高院裁定實屬不當</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿六日電〕蘇高院自於六月廿四日發表再字第四號裁定，核准褚逆民誼漢奸案開始再審，已引致該案承辦檢審官李曙東之反響，認為此項裁定，實屬不常，特於廿六日下午六時許，向高院提出抗吿，理由書另錄，請求撤銷再審之裁定，記者聞訊後，即馳赴分謁院檢兩首長，承孫院長談稱：中國司法之檢察制度，原屬獨立，本案旣經檢察官認為不合而提出抗吿，本院自應依法請示最高法院，以為最後決定。韓首席則吿以凡經三審裁定之判決，依法不得再生異議，本案再審之裁定，似缺少法律根據，即就事實而言，褚逆徒託效忠國父，保全文獻之名，而行危害國本阻撓抗戰事實，不應藉為聲請再審之理由，是以檢察官提出抗吿，當靜待三審法院之最後決定云。茲錄其抗吿理由書如下：</p>
<p>抗告理由</p>
<p>江蘇高等法院檢察官抗吿理由書，被吿褚民誼，右被吿因漢奸案件，經本院於中華民國卅五年六月廿二日裁定，開始再審，本檢察官於同月廿四日接受送達，認為應行抗吿，茲敍述理由於後：本件原裁定准予開始再審，無非以聲請再審人，所稱被吿曾於民國卅一年間赴平，向日軍交涉領回國父靈臟，奉安陵園，又在滬與日軍力爭，將已被查封之國父遺著孫文學說原稿，及建國大綱手書等索回，有南京寗海路看守所詳細紀錄可稽，事關效忠國父，保存文獻，不無處理漢奸案件條例第三條之情形，原確定判決未予審酌，依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第廿八條第二項，應認為有再審之理由，惟效忠國父不在靈臟之奉安，而在遺囑之遵守，不在遺著之保存，而在遺敎之奉行，國父致力國民革命四十年，其目的在求中國之自由平等，其方法在聯合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奮鬥，國父遺囑詔示至明，茲被吿於中日戰事發生以後，即與在逆等通謀敵寇，組織偽政府，反抗本國，圖陷我民族於萬劫不復之地，此為最高法院覆判所確定之事實，是其所為，顯與國父遺囑有違，不忠莫大，其向日軍交涉領回國父靈臟，索還國父遺著，與其組織偽政府，潛處國民黨，盜用國民政府名義，同一用心，不過藉以籠絡民心，淆惑觀聽，以達其破壞抗戰，反抗本國之企圖，此奸臣賊子之慣抜，中外古今不乏其例，日抗戰而勝，國父遺著雖為敵寇查封，何患其不還，戰而不勝，國家淪亡，國父遺著雖存亦將無以奉行。按處理漢奸案件條例第三條，漢奸曾為協助抗戰工作或有利於人民之行為，證據確鑿者，始得减輕其刑，又特種刑事條件訴訟條例第廿八條第二項，為受判決人之利益，聲請再審，亦以判決確定後，因足影響於判決之重要證據漏未審酌，認為有重大錯誤，為其要件，各該條規定至明，本件被吿與日軍交涉，領回國父靈臟，索還國父遺著，縱屬實有其事，但如上所述，其行爲旣非協助抗戰，於人民又無利益可言，且被吿假效忠國父之名，而行其籠絡民心破壞抗戰之實，就其犯罪之手段言，依刑法第五十七條第四款，尙應從重論科，原確定判決，期予審酌，處以被吿極刑，並非有重大錯誤，聲請人之聲請再審，顯無理由，原裁定遽予照准，即難謂合，爰於法定期間內，提起抗吿，並叙明理由如右。江蘇高等法院檢察官李曙東，中華民國三十五年六月二十五日。</p>

<h3>社評　中國人民的對美態度</h3>
<p>一昨合衆社華盛頓電訊，國務院某官員稱：『莫斯科電台報吿謂美國與中國有「秘密協定」，延長租借法至一九四七年十一月一節，事實上此間並無根據。』又稱：此項消息或係根據目前國會考慮中法案條文之誤解；此法案將准許總統給予中國以軍事協助及其軍隊所必需之物品，以『履行聯合國憲章中美國所負之義務。』國會或將授權總統不僅至一九四七年十月，且延至此後十年；同時馬歇爾之和平程序如進行順利，在正式統一未實現前，共軍亦將得到援助。我們在讀到這電訊的時候，毛澤東却在延安公開發表反美言論，謂美國軍事援華，實係武裝干涉，並要求美國立刻停止對華軍事援助，撤退駐華美軍。同時，本市發現有反美標語，且美軍人員有被少數羣衆包園漫駡情事；此項事件的發生誠為不幸。旣有是項反美標語及行為發生，為了表明中國人民一般的意向，對於這種卑劣的攻勢，我們要揭發其眞相，並表示我們的態度。</p>
<p>首先我們要聲明的就是這種反美標語及行為是少數敗類所為，決不能代表中國一般人民的意向。在擊潰日寇的努力上，中美靑年，彼此曾比肩作戰；傳統的中美友誼，經過了這一番血的洗禮，是愈益凝固而緊密了。在立國的精神上，民族的性格感情上，乃至地理環境上，沒有兩個民族能够像中美兩國那樣的接近。中國的抗日戰爭雖吿勝利，但國民革命的大業依舊還沒有完成；為完成我們的革命，我們正需要一個偉大的兄弟之邦如美國那樣的援助。中國人民對於美國在華的種種努力，特別是這位譽滿犬下的五星元帥馬歇爾特使的種種努力，無不深表感謝之忱。如果中國人民對我們偉大的鄰邦除了感謝之外，還有什麽別的感覺，這感覺是他們覺得美國對於我們的援助似猶未够，這大約也許是由於他們希望過殷之故。因此，任何反美情緒决不是中國人民自發的；任何反美情緒也决不能代表一般中國人民的情緒。</p>
<p>莫斯科「紅星報」二十二日撰文評中國局勢，指摘美國對華援助，大發排美之論，此在蘇聯方面的報紙，原非初次，在「消息報，」在「眞理報，」以及代表紅軍發言的「紅星報，」本常有反美的論調；出現在中國的反美宣傳攻勢，實多少與莫斯科的反美論調不無關聯。何以言之？中國人民對美有傳統的友誼，這友誼因戰事而更為凝固緊密，中國人民本身决不會有反美情緒，這是可斷言的。中國共產黨為了要掩飾自己的罪行，不欲有公正的的第三者看見它所為的種種不法行為，又與莫斯科互通聲氣，於是發為排美之論，發動反美的宣傳攻勢。這是共產黨的一種策略，這策略與其說是出自延安，無寗說出自共產國際的麥加。我們從一個較遠的角度來看，出現在中國的反美宣傳攻勢，不是中國人民一種自發的情緒，而實與出現在世界其它各地的反美攻勢相呼應，彼此為有聯絡的一環。</p>
<p>這是在這個意義下，所以共產黨的所為，實為有背於民族利益的行為。我們要提高國人對於共黨的警覺，像陳公博之類的顯明的漢奸現在是繩以國法了；而在我們中還有無形或不明顯的漢奸。中國人民的知識水準縱較低落，對於過去顯明事實的鑒別能力是有的。中國人民對於誰友誰敵也有確切的認識，掩飾不了他們內心的傾向。</p>
<p>我們更覺得有趣的，是莫斯科「紅星報」的反美論調，與毛澤東的反美言論，不特在時間上彼此遙相呼應，而且它們的內容完全一致，這眞是中國人民的呼聲嗎？我們希望中國人民拿出鑒別力來，別再來做第三者的應聲蟲；盲從的人應該明白他們怎樣在被人家利用而貽誤了國事，應該及早回頭。至於美國的朋友們，我們信任他們有鑒別這種偽裝的能力與智慧。由於這種具有國際性的反美攻勢的展開，中美兩國人民彼此間應有更深的了解和更緊密的携手；世界和平的維繫就建築在這基礎上。</p>

<p>經濟動力來源　蘇聯尤爲需要</p>
<p>〔聯合社美國柯洛蘭杜州愛斯丹斯公園廿五日電〕國際管理及利用原子能大會，今日在此揭幕。芝加哥大學國際公法敎授賴德博士稱，國際管理原子能問題之解決，對於蘇聯較對美國尤為重要，蓋蘇聯幅員廣大，而缺乏廉價之煤斤。經濟的利用核子能作動力，目前雖尙未能確定，但已知其為用較煤更廣，如西伯里亞等地區並無廉價煤斤供應之處，當可早日證明其為一極有價値之動力來源。賴德主張原子能應由聯合國機構之國際委員會管理，此委員會之性質有如國際法庭。</p>

<p>管制計劃未確立前　美國決不放棄秘密</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕蘇聯對於原子問題欲逞已意，聯合國原子能管制有陷於停頓之虞，美國會方面亦為之震動。若干議員鄭重宣稱，美國非至國際管制辦法確立，決不放棄其原子彈秘密。蘇聯計劃中對於國際管制一層並未加以保證。蘇聯共黨主辦之眞理報指責美國原子彈國際管制計劃，為爭取世界覇權之變相，已引起參院原子能委會之嚴厲反駁。民主黨參議員羅塞爾稱，蘇聯應停止以小人之心，度君子之腹，美國之計劃，慷慨為懷，甘願放棄吾人才智與金錢獲得之發明，吾人所求者，不過為保衛世界及吾人本身，使其不致用為各種破壞而已。余堅決反對在確立管制計劃之前，透露一字情報，敢信國會大多數議員亦同此見解。</p>

<p>事變以後　（問）該事變後，日政府有無接獲關於東北日軍移動之報吿？（答）曾接獲「滿洲」總領事館之報吿。（問）是否在軍隊移動後接得報吿？（答）移動前亦曾接得報吿。（問）日內閣及外務省雖接得此項報吿，亦不能壓制日本軍部乎？（答）是。辯護人克萊斯曼問：軍部在「滿洲」之行動，樞密院亦無統制力乎？（答）無。內閣得經由軍部大臣將內閣之態度通知軍部，樞密院則連此機能亦無。（問）起訴書所稱一九三一年十一月十三日以後，日政府贊成實行侵略「滿洲」，以擴大其領土一事，是否屬實？（答）辭去外相一職後，僅知報紙所載消息。其次由檢察官海倫訊問：君接獲關東軍在「滿洲」結集兵力武器等之報告後，曾採取何種措置？（答）因事態重大，曾力請南陸相採取適當措置，渠對此亦表反對，且贊成余之意見。</p>
<p>軍事跋扈　（問）與南大將談話結果，曾取何種措置？（答）結果對軍部之統制，未發生任何效果。（問）是否在與南大將談話後發生東北事變？（答）是。（簡）該次軍隊之行動，應由內閣何人負責？（答）余認為應由陸相負責。九一八事變發生之日，內閣亦不知此事，當日閣議，陸相允調查後答覆。（問）關於軍隊之行動，內閣由何人獲得報吿？（答）陸相。（問）九一八事變發生時，內閣由何人獲得報吿？（答）約二日後獲得陸相之書面報吿。（問）事變發生時，內閣曾取何種方針？</p>
<p>內閣方針　（答）決定防止事件續發及不擴大事變之方針，並據此送達聲明書至國際聯盟。（問）該項政策由何人參加決定？（答）內閣全體。（問）陸相根據內閣之方針，曾採取何種行動？（答）余信陸相為不擴大方針曾作適當指示。（問）內閣曾對陸相命令其實行何種政策？（答）內閣不能訓令陸相？（問）內閣之政策有無實行？（答）事件未能阻止，余信南大將曾盡其所能，然事變擴大則係事實。（問）當時關東軍司令係誰？（答）由報紙上知係本莊大將，但本莊大將是否眞有實權則不知。（哄堂大笑）。（問）為發生事變之故，有無召喚本莊大將？（答）無。（問）本莊大將部屬有誰曾受懲戒處分？（答）不知。（問）當時駐華公使係誰？（答）似係重光。（問）東北事變曾否由中日間解決？</p>

<p>三月暴動事件</p>
<p>〔改造社東京廿六日電〕國際法庭今日傳訊幣原後，進而審訊從未揭露眞相之著名三月陰謀暴動事件，傳證人淸水行之助到庭作證。淸水早與各種國家主義團體發生關係。一九一九年與北一輝，岩田富美等自中國返日，即參加大化會，一九二四年組織大行社，從事日本國粹運動。海倫檢察官先朗續淸水之口供錄稱：「（一）一九一九年與北一輝同道歸國，將北一輝介紹給大川周明。（二）至一九三一年三月止，大川時在金龍亭酒館與橋本欣五郞等陸軍將校聚會。據大川所言，此等將校以改造日政府為目的，企圖革命。余為此目的曾捐助二千元與大川。余之任務為當大川等舉行示威運動時向議會堂外投擲炸彈。大川曾訂劃引軍人入議會佔領政府。</p>
<p>炸彈三百　據大川謂，橋本自陸軍獲得炸彈約三百個，余乃加以收藏。（三）後大川言：此計因參與陰謀之陸軍縮手而失敗。又據大川洩漏，宇垣大將曾參與該項計劃。當大川以計劃進行失敗吿小磯軍務局長時，小磯曾答謂：「此計之放棄，乃基於陸軍之直接命令」。其後由德川義親侯爵之要求，乃將炸彈交還參謀本部之根本博上校。（四）一九三一年八月某日，大川謂：「本人將與川本大作上校，憲兵大尉甘粕，關東軍參謀次長板垣上校在瀋陽發動某種事件。」（五）一九三二年十二月出獄後，曾與大川數度晤面。大川為組織神武黨極其忙碌。該黨為極端國家主義團體，以驅逐白人出亞洲及改造日本政府為目的。一九三二年三月頃，大川曾謂：「與對日政府抱不滿之海軍靑年軍官及橘幸三郎等。共同參與某種陰謀」。余乃謂今後將不能參加該項計劃。」讀畢，由辯護人李凱克斯作反訊問：小磯及根本關係如何？炸彈還於何人？（答）因德川侯爵之要求，向小磯請示交還方法，其結果遂將炸彈還與當時任新聞班長之根本中校。（問）在三月事件後，另有此類計劃否？（答）不記為翌年抑為再翌年，大川又向余談及海軍官與茨城農民團將發動某種行動，命余參加，余鑑於三月事件之失敗而加以反對。</p>
<p>五一五事件　其後得悉大川曾參與五，一五事件。（問）此事與此次戰爭有何關聯乎？（答）無何關聯。（問）關於瀋陽事件之爆發，大川曾有何種言語吿汝乎？（答）雖無明確意見吿余，然在酒肆酒醉後曾謂：「三月事件雖失敗，但最近在瀋陽將有某種有趣問題發生。」（間）大川對於此「某種有趣事件」曾談及其內容否（答）雖未明言，但由常識已心會。（問）何謂由常識已心會？（答）意即在不言中已領悟也。繼由淸水對被吿橋本欣五郞之辯護人林一郞之訊問答稱：三月事件之目標，在於糾彈當時為黨政黨略而忽視國民幸福之政友會及民政黨，並無侵略性質。（問）神武會網領中有無驅逐白人出亞洲一條？（答）無。（問）汝在口供錄中謂神武會以驅逐白種人出亞洲為目的，與此刻之證言不同，孰為眞實？（答）當時社會之一般觀念如是。（因淸水不作明確回答，答非所問，致使嚴肅之法庭充滿哄然大笑，雖經林一郞重行追問，但淸水終不作明確回答，只得作罷。）</p>
<p>其次傳證人德川義親，宣讀其口供錄稱：「本人熟悉大川，曾與之討論鼓吹昭和維新問題，</p>
<p>驅逐白人　渠曾述泛亞細亞主義及白人之壓迫亞洲民族等。一九三一年曾與大川議論將軍國主義者置於政治當政地位之計劃。該年二月中旬，陸軍上校河本大作來謂奉軍務局長小磯之命令，請余往晤大川，勸彼等放棄置政府於軍部下之計劃。大川乃遵照軍部之意行動。數月後，小磯謂淸水拒絕交還三月事件所用三百枚炸彈，余乃勸淸水交還。」繼由辯護人作反訊問：當時小磯少將是否係該計劃之策劃者？（答）不知其詳。（問）當時知該項炸彈之性能否？（答）其後始知係不能殺人之假炸彈。（問）口供錄中有「置軍國主義者於政府當政地位」一語，常時曾用此種表現否？（答）未曾用軍國主義者一語。（問）所謂軍國主義者是何意義？（答）用軍之力量之意。大川當時認爲余用軍之力量以外，不能打破常時之黑暗政治。</p>

<h3>上海經濟危機迫切　外商代為聯各函市長並呈建議書　高物價高工資亟待解決</h3>
<p>上海英國商業團體代表葛士威克，荷蘭商業團體代表多利，瑞士商業團體代表勃立脫，挪威商業團體代表何果考，法國商業團體代表薛考脫等，日前聯名致函吳市畏國楨，並附呈建議書，備述田於勞工問題所引起之高物價高工資及勞資糾紛等等，以致本市生產品成本過大，生產萎縮，經濟危機至迫，情形異常嚴重。茲將建議書譯錄如下：</p>
<p>建議書全文</p>
<p>（一）余等對上海經濟問題亟願有所建議，尤以關於因勞工問題引起之高物價，高工資及糾紛等等。（二）貴市政府發佈之生活指數，最近激增，五月份為52.02％，遠較過去數月為高。總之，生活指數比之一九三六年已增加至少四千佑。（三）在此通貨膨脹期間，統制外匯率亦同時施行，美金票之核定，較之一九三六年前之價值，則僅增加五九三倍。（四）通貨膨脹與統制外匯造成一種三項不平之結果：第一，外人遭遇之影響，余等深信中國人亦然，無論在私人生活方面及經營商業方面，均感受消費損失不貲。第二，本市生產成本過大，由於競爭價格，簡直不能製造產物。第三，製造成本之所以過高係因勞工問題及運輸問題，出口更無論矣。（五）此種情形已繼續有六個月左右，完全是一種極顯明之不變性的敗壞。因此余等可斷言，在以後數星期中，上海之經濟情形倘無法改善，則本市多數企業為維持最低狀態，將縮小營業範圍，或關閉工廠及營業所。此種行動，當非企業家所願為也。（六）結果失業者必大增，成千成萬之人無工可做，亦無法謀生，此種危機決不能以平心靜氣之態度，默思其事。市長多次講解關於高物價，高工資的危險（使一般資方難能照付其員工），如此情形，倘不加改善，經濟之崩潰指日可望。（七）如不將此種實情，呈報市長，不僅辜負本身，更有負於市政府及勞工界。即以市民立場而言，余等亦深覺應負勉共患難之責。為保障資方之幸福起見，經濟不利情形，決不應容其長此籠罩於上海市。具呈人：英國商業團體代表葛士威克，荷蘭商業團體代表多利，瑞士商業團體代表勃立脫，挪威商業團體代表何果考，法國商業團體代表薛考脫。</p>

<h3>警備部提訊任星崖</h3>
<p>〔本報訓〕糧貸案昨日並無新發展，汪達人任星崖自地檢處移解警備司令部後，昨日下午軍法處單獨提訊任星崖，現該案之進行頗顯沈悶，何日正式開審，尚無決定。軍法處日來一方面整理偵訊結果，一方面靜侯上峯之指示及糧部之答覆。又據警備部表示，糧貸案係奉蔣主席命令辦理，應依軍法審判，絕非普通司法案件。</p>
<h3>中醫師代表　晉京請願　為考試院限期檢覈事</h3>
<p>自民國三十二年醫師法公佈後，本市地處淪陷，全市中醫西醫牙醫均未向考試院聲請檢覈，以致本市衛生局發出執照，多數均發臨時執照，其有效期限以今年十二月三十日為止。本市中醫方面有臨時執照一千六百餘張，檢覈手續繁重，內有保證書一項，實屬窒礙難行。兼以南京考試院還都未久，進行頗見遲緩。本市中醫師公會為此迭次會議商討，昨經議決推派陳存仁·程迪仁·張贊臣三人赴京請願。一待獲得切實辦法，即行閉始辦理檢覈事宜。</p>

<h3>戲院業昨赴市府請求減低娛樂捐</h3>
<p>本市戲院業計九十餘家，因當局所定娛樂捐太高，不勝負擔，而售票限價，使該業收入過低，無法應付開支，日前經同業公會議決，再度籲請當局調整，並經決定將自七月一日起，全市戲院自動停業。昨晨十時，由代表周劍星等五人，赴市府籲請調整，由何秘書長代表見，代表等提出：（一）宵禁取消後，對於戲院營業時間仍規定至晚十一時為止，要求調整。（二）要求取消限價。（三）要求減低娛樂捐，何氏表示一二兩點，可以設法，第三點無法接受。又周等定今晨赴市財政局與市社會局，再作呼籲，並定今日午後開全體大會商討繼續進行辦法</p>
<h3>活埋案審結　定下月初宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕徐州人鄭正華，住梅隴鎮張家弄，曾供職敵憲兵隊，憑勢作惡，禍害良民，去年十一月十六日黃昏，鄉長孫富祥指鄭為匪，嗾使鄉民郁福寶等四人闖入鄭之臥室，將鄭拖至羅王廟兇毆後，又活埋於仙人廟附近，以洩數年來之積憤，嗣由其妻郁菊妹向警備部訴述，將孫郁二人拘送地院。昨晨開審時，被告供郁菊妹係因敲詐末遂而誣告，經詳詢一過，庭論七月三日宣判。</p>
<h3>全市出差汽車現有四百餘輸　吉普車　出租問題　各車行尚在考慮中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市已登記之出租汽車行共卅三家，汽車四百零七輛。計祥生六二、亞洲一三，新新二，中國聯業二〇，安泰一二，滬東二，順風一四，中國交通九，通利七，新閘一五，大來一九，滬南一五，公大一三，友寗六，華麗三，東華二四，中華一九，上海七，中央興隆三一，海達一〇，大華（車輛數尚未登記），飛雲二九，中山九，揚子（車輛數未登記），開利一八，東方四，億太（車輛數未登記），滬嘉二〇，卡德九，福州（車輛數未登記），綠寶一〇，新生五，百樂（車輛數未登記）。</p>
<p>事實上全滬出租汽車尚不止此數，因有若干私人之車輛依附於上列車行名下營業，而登記時則不列在內。各車行之營業均極興旺，因汽車速度既快，價格便宜，較之其他交通工具合算得多。戰事初平時，每二十分鐘一干六百元，後加至二千四百元，顧客仍擠寒於門，往往須排隊等候，甚至發生爭吵等事。車輛均終日奔馳於外，極少返行休息之機會。最近因物價高漲，車行擬加價至四千元，然社會局僅准加至三千六百元，故迄今尚在交涉請求。現司機每日工資約為一元七角，照工人生活指數計算，普通職員月薪約六十元左右，亦照工人生活指數計算。目前國外新車及材料尚無進口，故車輛損壞後之補充修理頗成問題。最近行政院物資供應局擬以每輛美金一千六元之代價撥吉普卡一千五百輛交各車行組織聯合公司。行方認為吉普卡在冬季及風雨時頗不適合，勢必加以改裝，而將來新車進口後，營業亦頗堪慮，且兩年內分期付款之辦法，各車行是否能善其始終，亦為使負責人擔心之問題，故條件方面尚在考慮中。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據市公用局負責人告記者稱：目前曾有人向該局呈請，擬向美國訂購大批吉普車略經改裝後，即公開出租，然美軍部曾有命令限制吉普車專供軍用，故公用局無權批准，現正向市府請示中。</p>
<h3>兩颱風醞釀中　京滬區將遭襲</h3>
<p>本年度第二次颱風，自於溫州登陸後，風力即消滅，然連日本市尚有強力勁風。記者昨再訪中央氣象局上海氣象台負責人，據談本市連日遭受勁風襲擊，原因為自颱風過後，尚有高氣壓自北太平洋昇入長江以北，同時以江西以南有低氣壓流入京滬兩地，因以高低氣壓交併，遂發生強大風力。至帛琉島之北，發生之颱風，自消失之後，該島東部，頃又有一強烈颱風，在醞釀中，同時中國南海亦有颱風醞釀現象，惟方向及風力，速力，尚米能悉，今日可能確定。據預測，此後風力將超過上次，京滬兩地恐艱免遭受侵襲。茲將上海氣象台之每日報告併錄如后</p>
<p>熟帶氣流佈滿全國，太平洋尚穩定於日本，琉球及花島山鳥。熱帶低壓區或可能颱風，在帛琉之西北。</p>

<h3>江上緝私工作尚感實力單薄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨晤本市水上警察分局長吳克孝，與談該局最近工作及緝私情形。據稱：該分局依照編制可有警士六百名，惟現因提高素質，須中學程度考試後再加訓練，故目前合格工作之警士僅二百餘名。該局在黃浦江設分駐所三處，派出所十一處，現有巡邏船七艘，均已陳舊不堪，其中三艘且已損壞，尚在修理中，對於工作不無影響。所餘四艘除三分駐所各派一艘外，分局僅剩一艘。晝間相互對開，終日巡邏江面，夜間加開雙班，澈夜工作。至於緝私方面，僅係協助關警性質，最近曾緝獲大批漏稅之美煙及糖果，均已交與海關。吳氏並稱：上海環境複雜，經百年租界及八年敵偽之統治，加以帮會勢力之影響，欲完全剷除沿江及碼頭上之惡勢力，殊非一朝一夕之事云。</p>
<h3>偽宣傳部次長　章克答辯如演講　偽最高法院院長　張韜受審　大搖大擺　金牙閃閃口氣惡劣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕偽宣傳部次長章克，杭州人，四十三歲，早歲畢業於哥倫比亞大學，後又在柏林大學政讀，歸國後曾任陳友仁之私人秘書，香港陷落後被俘，在滬蟄居多時，後卒應林逆柏生之請，就任偽宣部次長，凡四月另十天，辭職後發刊「大公」周刊。前由高院提訊一過，昨日下午審結，被告對起訴書晝辯多時，抑揚挫頓，宛加高聲演講。其內容可分二點：（一）在偽宣傳部次長任內，從未發表推行和運，宣揚偽職之文字或演講，（二）而在其發刋之「大公」周刋上，則盡力貫澈其在偽職任內未能貫澈之任務，而從事指斥偽府，宣揚抗戰之工作。嗣又列舉「大公」各期之文字以為佐證。庭上又問其投偽經過，則稱：「林柏生跑來對我說，汪精衛之病已無救，死了加何善後？我就說祗有解散偽組織，召集民衆代表會議來決定，乃與陳公博商定，遂出任偽宣傳部次長，以進行該項工作。商量時，曾琦·季思浩均在座，亦明知此事，決非我侮辱他。」言次嘶聲力竭，忘其所在，為法官所止。後經洪士豪律師為之義務辯護後，庭諭辯論終結，定七月二日下午二時半宣判。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕張韜，浙江蕭山人，現年六十一歲，係國民黨員，從民國七年起，在杭州·上海二地做了九年的律師，又曾出任北平大理院推事，及江浙兩省各級法院庭長等職。中日戰起，忽而變節，民國廿七年，溫逆宗堯，梁逆鴻志等在滬組織「維新政府」，以圖反抗中央，張任偽「立法委員」兼「經濟委員會委員長」，至廿九年三月，汪逆精衛，陳逆公博等組織南京偽國民政府，樹立叛逆政權時，又轉任偽最高法院院長，直至敵偽瓦解，始被捕法辦。昨晨高院開審時，張穿藕灰色綢長衫，內襯自紡綢短衫褲，灰襪黑鞋，鼻架老光眼睛，手拿一把竹骨扇子，大搖大擺，雙手撐着被告欄。答供時，張口就露出二隻金牙齒，口中不斷地說着「是哦」？「庭上懂哦」？之類不恭敬句語，手中的扇子也跳起舞來，可是被法警拿去了，他就失去了一個幫助表情的道真。據張供稱：他與陳則民為同學，畢業於遜清之時，後即在法界服務。民國十三年加入國民黨，十七年舉行黨員登記時，因係西山會議派被擯棄，遂將黨證撕毀。後來雖又入黨，然未領得黨證。在其偽經濟委員會委員長任內，日方曾要求將鐵道，電信，水電等十大公司歸日商經營，均遭彼等拒絕，不予通過，可見朱嘗不利於國。至「最高法院」事，謂亦不過是司法而已，亦無禍害國家之處云云。至十一時許，始行退庭，諭改期再訊。</p>

<h3>錢永銘談幣制　改革之說尚非其時</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪交通銀行董事長錢永銘氏，即以對目前國內一般經濟財政現狀之意見。渠稱：目前國內經濟財政之轉捩點，仍與整個政治問題之解泱有關。蓋以政治問題未解決，全國交通未能暢通，各地經濟全融之構通，均告隔絕，稅收亦無法復原，故國家財政，實無法平衡，因面出現赤字預算。至改革幣制之說，錢氏認為目前似不可能。且幣制改革方案，貴乎能一勞永逸，決不能一而再，再而三。故目前改革之說，尚非其時。錢氏對中央銀行之外匯及黃金政策，認為適宜。惟渠希望中央銀行對我國之內匯問題，應多加注意。錢氏末對本市之財政金融前途，表示樂觀。渠稱：蔣主席對政治大局，苦心孤詣，而馬歇爾特使更不辭辛勞，奔走斡旋，故甚望國內各方面，能相忍團結。更望對當局施策常有抨擊諸人，應積極參加合作，各抒己見，勿徒事空評，而於實際則毫無裨益云。</p>
<h3>人民自由保障會講究毆傷學生案</h3>
<p>本市日前發生之愛國學生被毆案，各界甚為重視，本市人民自由保障會，據上海市學生反內亂大同盟籲請後，業經派員調查，並已提會討論。已分向市府暨法院提供意見，主張對該案從嚴究辦。</p>
<h3>赴京願各「代表」五十三團體無根據</h3>
<p>報載馬敘倫等於本月廿五日在南京招待記者茶會稱，所調上海人民團體「上海市第三區紡織業產業工會」等五十三單位，公推來京請願代表等語，中央社記者昨向主管人民團體之社會局詢問，據稱：上海市棉紡棉織業，向係分別組織，並無第三區紡織業產業工曾之組織，即原有之第三區棉紡產樂工會及第三區棉織業產業工會，亦早已分別改組為廠工會，並將圖記繳銷在案。該蕢延芳等所稱五十三團體，經查均非依法核准之團體，顯係影　名義，盜竊民意。又上海市商會第九次會員大會及全上海工界反內亂大同盟及上海市學生總會等，均經發表宣言，否認蕢延芳等為上海各界代表，可知此類自稱代表之人，實際全無根據，所稱「五十三團體」云云，亦屬偽造無疑云。</p>
<h3>巡視收容所難胞爭訴苦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自蘇北流亡來滬之難胞，日多一日，救濟問題，迫不容緩。記者昨至東嘉興路小菜場樓上所設之收容所巡視，難胞紛紛圍繞申訴，據彼等稱：收容所前雖一度領得救濟麵粉，但僧多粥少，不夠分配。今每日祗簿粥一餐，何能依之度日。故難胞日間多出外自行謀生，或拉車，或作苦力，甚或求乞以糊口。此中雖多鄉農等平民，但亦有甚多被「鬥爭」光之小康者，今流落滬地，雖欲做苦工亦不易，故急切盼望外界能多多救濟。該處現共收容二百餘人，雜居一處，衛生問題，殊堪憂慮。</p>

<p>秩序井然</p>
<p>昨日觀衆約計萬餘人，俱為救災而來，軍警　兵，昨天隊出動，緊要路口，除佈置崗位外，並有鐵絲網，防綫數道，故秩序井然，但不守秩序之球迷，徘徊塲外四週，直至終塲前一刻鐘，一部份觀衆，仍衝破籬笆而人，幸比賽不久即告終結。昨日兩隊出場陣容如下：</p>

<p>瞿永福　孟義良　高保正</p>

<p>比賽在國歌聲中開始，裁判張樂，杜月笙步入塲中，行開球禮，撥動皮球，兩軍接觸，張金海截得來球，下令攻擊，孟義良中樞坐鎭，擉斷去路，五分鐘時，費春華單騎深入，霍躍華趕救不及，小費初試脚頭，惜乎偏斜未中，未幾，羅偉櫂中路起義，卅碼處試射，越門高逸，未一分鐘，孟義良誤犯左脚王，許竟成卅碼外主罰，球勢峻急，奈又稍偏，又吿野逸。十分鐘時，保正小傳右角，春華邊路徐進，到得好處，舉足力射，中兆恒懷抱。形勢平均各有攻守。</p>

<p>遷敬一隻</p>
<p>拍賣義球及給獎旣畢，兩陣再圓，星東原班人馬應戰，靑白羅壽福小休，徐德明替補入塲。開賽後，青白前鋒，環攻不捨，二分鐘時，靑白得義良接濟，正待傳中；繼華犯規，禁區十二碼，許文奎主罰，左上角破星東球網，一比一，造成和局。二分鐘前一隻十二碼，二分鐘後，亦是一隻十二碼，真所謂平分秋色，禮尙往來。</p>
<p>秋亭妙中</p>
<p>青白得手，士氣大盛，九分鐘時，小費單槍匹馬，長驅直入，小傳左角，曹秋亭及時趕至，十碼左右，再破敵壘，二比一靑白反敗為勝。十五分鐘，保正臥地救球，又吿犯規，兆榮主罰未有所獲，時耀華退出，碩友進補左翼，松生移前衛，羅偉權居中，許竟城退為左後衛，經此調動，星束乘機猛攻，然仍無補於事，終塲前二分鐘，吳祺祥為羅偉權猛撞，重傷離塲。未幾，時間終了，二比一，靑白再勝星東。</p>

<p>金價無特殊變化　港票比美鈔吃香</p>
<p>烚赤昨再穩定，中央配給價酌提高至一九五萬，配出二四五條，人心以水漲船高，更為堅定，晨開已見小秀，開後鑒於幣制改革，微露端倪，買戶尙殷，微挺至一九六萬五，始有浮多脫手，加之中央登記配給為配給價格關係，買戶稍吿旁觀，惟交易有限，並無時殊變化，午刻微挫至一九四萬，午後又哄高至一九六萬五左右，結果較前收好起一萬五，飾金念萬零八，紋銀價平，息價自一角三分至一角六不等。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔仍難激動，晨開平平，晨開平平，中途小升至二六八〇元，但為時至暫迨未金價微回，午刻在二六五〇元左右徘徊，午後稍吿微升，惟漲勢不逮黃金，結果仍較前收微升十元，港票仍吿吃香，自五一五元升至五三〇元以上，結果較前收再升十二元。港滙自五二〇元升至五三五元左右。帶好印滙。升至六五〇左右，英匯八千五至八千元，成交仍以港匯為活，美匯明平暗呆。</p>
<h3>公債交易零星</h3>
<p>公債交易仍屬零星，由多空互相軋直，大勢呈拉鋸局面，事實上喊價離事實尙遠，空方則不欲多事流連，見利紛補業中雖有種種幼稚而膚淺之所謂決議，組織散漫，有識之同業亦不加十分重視，是以大部份袖手旁觀，現下進行塲外交易者，都屬零星居多，統丙高價八五〇元，低價七七〇元，最後仍在前日價盤旋，雜牌續見喊上一步，結果丙種平疲，雜牌再穩。</p>
<h3>紗布穩定</h3>
<p>昨日紗市轉趨穩定，華南帮復見光臨，雙馬又升到一百五十五萬，收市獨俏六萬，其餘廿支中小型價殊平庸，成交不多，午時紡建公司照例開紗，廿支中有藍鳳供售，價較上期之豐年標高三萬元，其餘各支粗細紗綫標價均與上期相仿。</p>
<p>嗶嘰坯布氣勢依然堅挺，此因客方銷路尙堪維持，故人心良好，嗶嘰因市上缺現，獨升千元，細布染廠及客帮皆有需求，亦昻五百元，其餘無甚軒輊。</p>

<h3>米糧到貨增加　市場趨勢穩定</h3>
<p>米市塲昨日客貨登記增加，總數二五〇六石，較前市激增一二四二石，內計埠尖二〇石，蕪秈一一四石，碾秈二三七二石，並米號自運自銷者四五二石，故一般趨勢仍穩定如恒，（昨日白元陰元，市價下趨，係米市塲懊報，實際市價並未更動，）麵粉形勢尙穩，步升二三百元，麩皮暫平，油價早堅午懈，價格彷彿，黃豆高貨尙定，中下胃呆，價跌五六百元，蠶豆定局，茶豆相仿，芝蔴亦少軒輊，豆餅汕頭納胃不濃，鄉銷甚懈，市形平正，小麥舟山寗波汕頭均無意進取，市况軟化</p>
<h3>投機妙用　多頭逢高出籠　股市又起回風</h3>
<p>華股昨突起回風連日外行游資見熱加入，永紗多頭公司乘機出籠漲後多盤，散戶及新多又起動搖，昨市不支而退，惟冷門小股有一二本身活動，突放異彩，中法高價做至二一七元成交，高價迫於大勢，亦稍帶小，但潛勢仍俏，晨開後最高時永紗五六〇元，美亞三六〇〇）元，景福二五五元，新光二七七元，勤興二二〇元，午前最低時永紗五一八元，美元三二〇〇元，景福二一八元，新光二三〇元，勤興一七〇元，而後略平，冷門中小型亦穩後微落，結果較前收永紗美亞回跌半成，景福新光一成左右，勤興一成半，冷門中小型除信和贈股須担負認股半數，回跌達一成，餘者均回挫殊微。</p>
<p>外股業中有一部份證券帮，鑒於封關在即，有所脫手而轉疲，怡紗晨開即退為九七〇〇元，美聯八四〇〇元，開後繼續下游，午刻疲後稍回，結果較前收英聯怡紗紙業亞洲各跌一成光景。怡　會德豐鋼業跌半成左右，業廣雖跌而尙少。</p>
<h3>房產業停滯　木材積貨多</h3>
<p>台灣磁磚亦有到貨　勝利以後，普遍性之建築，未見若何開展，八年以來，山地儲積已久之木材，咸冀於勝利以後，供建築上之需要，不意時至今日，適得相反之結果，現木材雖已運至都市，但走銷無路，貨價日跌，聞杭州方面，坐候於本行待售之木客，幾有生活開支超過木材價値者，近來運杭木材愈來愈多，而裝滬運銷，反多虧耗，杭地堆存木材，其中處木佔十分之四，徽木及浙西木材佔十分之五六。</p>
<p>閩木圓桶等木材，近以經營是項木業者，多非業中人，仍抱戰時單帮式之經營方法，故上項木材，　滬頗多，滬地應用木材，以方形為大宗，而方形木材，又以洋木為主，圓木鎖路，多在每年冬季，專恃蘇北一帶鄉間作為建築房屋之需，平時銷路殊少。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕台灣磁磚，前由滬商運來一批，行銷頗佳，聞下月上旬，又有一批可以裝滬銷售。</p>
<h3>浙絲廠已開工　川絲無法輸出</h3>
<p>浙江區因　汎較平，故目前各絲廠均已開始　絲工作，並有數十担生絲運滬，江蘇區蘭汎較遠，致開　者尙少，中蠶公司以外銷絲須合標準，故已於上週函知各貸款絲廠，將所繅生絲，槪交由該公司代收。</p>
<p>又春爾貸放實數，本係一，六八八。四七七萬元，已誌前報，茲據中蠶公司業務處負責人謂，春蠶貸款核准廠商中之合豐協記絲廠，其已貸金額係四〇·九五〇萬元。故貨放實數為一。六九四，四川產新絲，最近大量登塲，惟因運輸困難，外銷發生阻滯，　來市價日趨下跌，每關担由二·二五〇·〇〇〇元，跌至二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元，尙無受主。絲商刻正設法運滬銷售。</p>
<p>人絲標售　另定辦法</p>
<p>本市：中信產委員會，最近由各處運到敵產人絲數量頗為可觀，聞中信局因防少數人操縱，並使大小廠商均能標得起見，對標售辦法，將略有改動，一俟辦法改訂後，該項人絲即可標售，</p>
<h3>銀行法應重行修正　金融業出路在時局安定　李馥蓀氏發表重要談話</h3>
<p>上海為全國經濟重心，勝利以還，游資充斥，巳成投機市場，金融業存欵之運用，大成問題，據銀行業公會理事長李馥蓀氏稱：敵人投降以來，政局不安，交通阻塞，物價因而暴漲，在此種情况下，金融業當然未能盡其扶助工商之責任，業務亦多未合理想，李氏强調金融業之出路，謂時局安定，金融業始有辦法，因政局安定，交通恢復，物資暢流，工商繁榮，金融業之業務，自可發揮其應有之功能。李氏繼謂：目前各銀行，除辦理滙兌外，投資於商場中為多，工廠貸欵極少，一部則轉於蠶絲，棉業等貸欵。甚有冒險作投機事業者。關於穩定余融問題，李氏表示：常秉承中央政策，並依照中央銀行規定辦法辦理，李氏認為中央銀行之措施，甚為洽當，一般主張調整利率一事，李氏以客觀語調，謂此事並不簡單，應多從事實上研究。記者復詢以對於修正後之銀行法之意見。李表示仍有修正必要，並謂：本人現正與立法院商討應行修正各點，因我國情形特殊，銀行管制法令，應效英國寬的方式，不宜採用美國緊的政策，關于不動產抵押諸問題，均應重行加以研究修正，最近即可具體决定，彼時將有新銀行法規頒佈云。</p>

<h3>津展開科學攻勢　摧毀蝗蝻大本營</h3>
<p>— 特約紀者季紹林</p>
<p>本報廿三日天津航訊</p>
<p>天津附近的兩個產米區，一是小站，一是軍糧城，前者乃李鴻章的淮軍所開闢，後者在我們抗戰期中，日本人曾花了數年的時間，企圖把牠造成一個全盤科學化，機械化的五十萬大農塲的基幹，關於這個大農塲的情形，我想以後再作報吿。這裏，記者所記述的，是軍糧城區域最近遭遇到的一次禍害——蝗災。這次蝗災蔓及區域東西寬四十里，南北深十里，發現後，經中央農業試騐所動員了二十七位技術人員，並得到天津聯合國善後救濟總署辦事處及行政院善後救濟分署並駐津美海軍陸戰隊的協助，經過百餘日的奮鬥，終於把蝗災撲滅，以科學方法來治蝗，在這個區域裏還是第一次。</p>
<h3>蝗災源於運糧城　分兩路進襲</h3>
<p>蝗災的發生是在六月初，據事後調查，這羣小動物發源於軍糧城以北三十里的七里海湖沼草原地帶，最初牠們分兩路向南進襲，越過數十里的荒地，到達舊津塘公路附近地區，一路竄向軍糧城西二十里之張貴莊，主力則殺奔軍糧城，這時牠們又分為四路正面攻入軍糧城地帶，每路寬者達七華里，窄者也有三數里。蝗羣所到之處，地面幾乎全被這些小動物遮蔽，農作物，雯時就被啃光。</p>
<p>記者於二十二日赴災區視察，一株玉蜀黍留給我的印象最深，這株三尺許高的王蜀黍，葉子已全被吃凈，祗剩下禿禿的軀幹，像木棍似的挿在地上。就災情來說，很値得慶幸的是並未十分嚴重，因為小麥多已成熟，農民發現蝗蟲後，便搶着收割，而正當蝗　向灌溉區稻秧侵入的時候，被撲滅了。受害較甚的是秋收作物，也有一部份小麥因為收割過早，減收數成。</p>
<h3>北平專家趕津埠　展開殲滅戰</h3>
<p>北平中央農業試騐所在本月八日接到報吿，經過一度調查後，十四日由病蟲學專家劉廷蔚氏率領二十位農事學生及六位敎師，由北平來天津趕赴災區，着手防禦，並展開殲滅戰。蝗的成　，要到五齡後才能飛行，牠的　　能力可及於週圍二百里。幼蟲時代稱蝻，跳躍能力每天可前進一里，在災區最初發現者是大量的，三齡至四齡的蝻，最後幾天，有了成羣的飛蝗，據劉廷蔚先生說，蝗有一種習性，牠們常是大羣的集體行動在進行殲滅戰的時候，常利川牠這種特性，以藥餌殺蟲劑治除，但這次蝗羣進入舊津塘公路與北寗鐵路之間，這地帶溝渠縱橫，蘆葦叢生，蝗羣開始散開，對於進行殲滅戰上，這是個不利的地形。但是李代桃僵，蘆章替農作物受了災害，又該說是一個有利的地區。</p>
<h3>津美海軍陸戰隊　火攻蝗蟲窠</h3>
<p>在戰術上講：這次治蝗是同時應用了好幾個不同的辦法，主要的方法，是在農田上遍佈了藥餌，在　叢間噴洒殺蟲劑，但為了捕殺那些飛蝗，庶免二百里內其他地區復遭侵害，更動員了駐津美海軍陸戰隊，以最新式武器火焰噴射器，向飛蝗窠穴展開攻勢，聯全國善後救濟總署辦事處辦理這項交涉，立刻得到美軍當局的允許。美陸戰隊三十五名，於二十二日，携帶火焰噴射器十二具前往作戰，記者因到災區時間稍遲致未得參觀他們的戰鬥，祗能在那些戰塲上作了一番戰後的憑弔。火焰噴射器是集中於飛蝗窠聚的數處　塘，總面積約十餘畝，被燒萎的蘆葦，亂披在水上，死蝗漂在水面、顯得對那些火焰似乎毫未抵抗。據目擊者談；戰果是異常優良，其後我又在田野上巡視，藥餌隨處都有，蝗蝻遺屍也遍地皆是。和糖的砒霜石灰引誘牠們吃下肚裏去，結果是腑臟均被燒枯了，死在那裏。</p>
<h3>謹防牠捲土重來　蝗災成尾聲</h3>
<p>行政院善後救濟分署為了鼓勵農民捕殺蝗蝻，臨時訂了一個五斤蝗蝻換一斤麵粉的辦法，已經收換了一萬斤蝗蝻。這次蝗災，當也算得是一次殘酷的戰爭，現在蝗的大本營已被摧毀，蝗的主力已被擊潰。主要的五百八十畝秧田，二百畝品種試騐田，均獲保全，蝗災成為尾聲了。</p>
<p>記者曾問劉廷蔚先生，華北蝗蝻的發祥地，是那些地方，他說牠們多半發源於黃河流域冲積之三角洲地帶，有天津區，微山湖區，邳（縣）邱（縣）區，和開封區，他對於這次蝗災的展望不甚樂觀。他說：若不就發源地圖根本治除，秋後可能再發現，據說：飛蝗的鄕土觀念很濃厚，第一代的孩子雖然飛到別處去，第三代一定會飛回第一代的地方來。軍糧城也有「春南秋北」的俗諺，說牠春天自北而南，秋天自南而北，牠會不會捲土重來呢？秋後的情形是値得注意的。</p>
<h3>我空車第八大隊在東京</h3>
<p>— 朱民威</p>
<p>這是初夏，在日本厚木機塲的美軍服裝如同在上海的江灣美軍一般，着黃色卡嘰軍便服。在厚木機場也如同在上海，在昆明，在成都，用小士吉日跑來跑去，用大吉普裝物件。美國人的標準化服裝動作以及軍八魁偉的身材，柔和而也乾脆的辦事手法，把美國的實用文化傳播了全世界。</p>
<p>東京市觀光</p>
<p>一部吉普專門開過來用DDT給剛落地的B24噴洒了裏外，美國人愛用他的物資來實現他的規定，而不講虛套與情面。（你自然不可能想像騎馬去訪人，下馬後由主人命人為你洗刷一次馬的全身。）隨後問道：</p>
<p>「有人看守這架B24嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有的。我們的警戒兵留在大塲了。」</p>
<p>「那好，我們派一名M．P．替你們日夜守衛。」</p>
<p>車輛派出送錢隊長一組人到東京少校軍官是轎車，顏色是草灰色，車內是沙發，上尉以下是吉普，由厚木機塲一條碎石路向東北三十英里外的東京行。吉普車由日本人司機，轎車則是美國人司機，路上的灰塵揚起來比在巾國西部都還濃厚，不過路很平，沒有不平之處，路上兩勞的邱陵全植滿了梯田稻作，靑色遍山野，沒有一塊荒蕪、路過橫濱市區，看到這個被美機炸得破爛城市景象才又呌人想到八個月以前這兒天空與地而的惡鬥。到東京市區後，美軍把錢隊長等駛往一所華　旅館，這旅館是以前的三井洋行俱樂部，在東京地皮那麼昻貴，三井俱樂部二個花園，一共佔地十八畝，池塘石山林木與小橋，構成了市街閙聲所不及的隱境。</p>
<p>二十八日朱世明團長與戴堅師長赴名古屋盟軍總部開會，並察看中國駐日佔領軍營房。錢祖倫等一行即落在閑暇的自由訪問遊歷中。大家都是第一次到日本，而且是以戰勝國的軍八身份到佔領區來，一切都得符合美軍在這裏所造成的佔領軍風習方行，因此大家都穿上不是戰衣的軍常服，深綠色嗶嘰料子裁成的留美時代制服穿上身，出門一定按階級乘轎車，或吉普，第一個目標，當然是觀光東京市街。</p>
<p>東京市街經過九個月佔領，戰跡已不大看得到，那些市區被炸的房屋大多經過一番人工整理，雖然還留着斷牆殘壁，但並不灰燼堆積，至於馬路，更看不到炸彈坑，早已用柏油塡補光坦。汽車行到任何地方，都是平穩而不跳動，東京市街繁盛區銀座，風景區上野公園，以及附郊明治天皇墓，東鄕大將墓，都去走過。</p>
<p>深刻的印象</p>
<p>日本人的衣食住行在戰後的表現，目前並不比戰前太壞，這裏看出麥帥的手法並不是一個單純軍人辦法。麥帥在日本，軍事與重工業是不容許存在，但在維護戰敗者日本人民的生存上，這個老將軍却做着「盡量讓日本人做工，也讓日本人吃飽」，現在日本的米是官賣，人民按一定時候去買定量的米，當然這量是少於需要，但可使日本人不致餓死，另外麥帥總部使得日本大半可以開工的絲織廠，紗廠都開了工，並且為日本產品在美國找尋市塲，更以輪船運送這些日本貨去換取美洲的麵粉，好以麵包塡飽工作的日本人肚子。</p>
<p>日本人的衣裳因為是打了敗仗，所以上上下下都不講究面子而將就穿着，差不多男人在壯丁年齡都是穿的日本兵短而緊身的制服，帶着覆眉的鴨舌小窄帽，像我們在京滬以及長江沿錢所見的日俘打扮一樣，只是所有的標明階級記號都摘去。女人大多穿西服，像在上海虹口區域所常見的日本女人那樣，也有穿一種上衣連褲的飛行衣似的裝束。</p>
<p>他們自己抱定一個念顯：「打敗了仗，一切都得從頭做起，像砌屋的匠人面對遇風暴倒下的毀屋，知道艱苦歲月在前面長得很，這起點當然更苦」！他們也很寗靜，因為屋子已倒塌了，反而去了一層惟恐覆滅的惶恐，只要看「數寄屋橋」（橋名）附近他們釣魚的悠閑，就可見一斑。</p>
<p>日本人的尊嚴自然談不到，因此他們索性把面子丟掉，在中國飯店或其他日本食堂，錢祖綸他們把吃剩的一點魷魚，送給日本女食客，這些女人非常感激的收吃了。因為她們吃的是一碗白飯，能以買一枚鷄蛋佐餐，就認為是奢侈品了。</p>
<p>後來他們去遊過熱海溫泉，日本交通系統的週密以及鄉村，　地山野林木的稠密，令他們深深留下印象，中國要趕上對海這個戰敗的國家，單是這二件事，就得花上一些鍥而不捨的精神與艱辛的歲月。（十六日·上海）</p>

<h3>我也來談論國是</h3>
<p>主筆先生：鄙人目睹目前書報雜誌之左傾執筆者，立論往往歸咎於政府一方，其影響人心，至深且烈。鄙人由於愛國心之驅使，實難忍其淆惑黑白，與彼輩一論今日的國是。</p>
<p>目今一般人談到國共糾紛時，往往歸罪於國民黨。許多極端者，甚至以為國民黨有百非而無一是，而共產黨則有百是而無一非。我們稍具一點理智和良心的人，再不能容其歪曲是非，也得表明我們的意見：</p>
<p>（一）不容再拖了！——反對內戰，是舉國一致的要求。事實呢，經過多少人的調停，幾度的談判，幾次的停戰協定之後，總是停了又打，打了又停，邊談邊打，邊打邊談。這樣的談判，這樣的停戰，從勝利至今，已將十個月了，而全國人民仍然受着戰爭的苦痛，流亡不能歸家，生活不能安定，經濟恐慌，復員梗塞，人民同聲指責政府，而政府也苦悶於整個的財政預算不能平衡，經濟施策動輙受掣，歸根溯源，還不是因了全國的交通不能統一，物資不能流通，及政令不能普及之故嗎？所以在政府說來，也一定很厭惡內戰的。目前和平的大道，是共黨放下武器，政府進行改組，假如說，雙方都照此妥協，全國和平而統一，兩萬均可以民主的方式競爭政權。據目前的情勢看去，國民黨或仍可能是佔得優勢的政黨，革新圖治，不難挽回巳失的人心。而共黨旣未有取得政權的把握，乃寄其唯一的希望於使混亂局勢惡化下去，直拖到民不聊生的時候為止。那時人民對政府，再也不能信仰，對現實再也不能忍受，然後暴動者認為絕好的機會到了若此而求和平，何異緣木而求魚？—因此，我們向大家呼籥時局再不容再拖了，須在最短的期限內，解决全　問題。</p>
<p>（二）東北即應整個接收。接收東北，基於開羅協定，也基於中蘇條約，基於政府自九一八以来的一貫政策，也基於全國一致的要求。所以只有今日內外公認的政府，接收東北主權，是名正言順天經地義的事。如有任何人企圖强佔東北，就是圖謀不軌。經渦我們唇敝舌焦的呼籥，友邦義正詞嚴的聲援，好容易一蘇軍撤退東北，正常國軍去接收的時候，偏偏共產黨假借人民的名義，强佔了東北，阻碍政府行使主權，這種不顧國家大局的行為，我們為什麼還要容忍？共黨荒謬的理論中，同他們借用「民主」和「自由」的意義一樣，有所謂「人民的主權」和「人民的武力。」稍具知識的人，都知道他們濫用了主權的意義，此處可無庸辨釋。祗問這「人民的武力」是從何處來的？敵偽盤據之時，未聞也；蘇軍進兵之時，亦未聞也；恰在國軍接收的時候，才從地下出來，未免認錯目標了！我們除要求政府即刻接收整個東北以外、更不能承認任何新的偽組織的政權和武力。</p>
<p>（三）給馬帥以公斷權。—誰是最公正的，當然是人民，然而人民的意見實在太多了，而真正多數人民的意見則很難聽到。至於馬帥，當然有人會攻擊他是美國人，然而在這混沌的局面中，比較站在是非　外的旁觀者，也只有美國人了。那麽美國又為什麽要關心中國的局勢呢？因為現在世界大勢，唯有中國和平，遠東才有和平，唯有中國强盛世界才能安定，況亂的中國，會醞釀為戰爭之泉源，衰弱的中國，為强鄰之所垂涎，所以美國人關心中國的利益，也就是關心美國本身之利益，美國人企求本身之安全，間接也須使得中國安全。由於此，我們乃承認馬帥為一够資格之調解者。「政治民主化，軍隊國家化，」是國人的主張，同時也是馬帥提出和解的條件。我們旣同意馬帥的地位，也同意馬帥的主張，那麽為避免拖延起見，須得給馬帥以公斷的權力。「政協」之後，共黨藉口二中會議不利於彼，趁馬帥回國當兒，在東北强佔畏春，在華北破壞停戰協定，乃演成今日的局面。至於政府是否企圖毀約，還只是共黨估計而已，而共黨則眞正先毀約了！　在何方？自有公論。大槪共黨之所以尙不願接受馬帥的公斷，也在乎此。</p>
<p>（四）共黨何以要攻擊盟邦？—共黨說美國干涉中國內政，妨害中國主權，並大聲疾呼「美軍退出中國」等等。這些論調，很易使人衝動，可是仔細一想，這不就是共黨拒絕接受馬帥公斷權及攻擊美軍為政府運兵之側而攻勢嗎？茲對此申論如後：（一）美國調停我國內戰，誰也不能否認這不是干涉我國內政，我們甘願如此的理由，除如前章所說以外，唯有痛切自責，刻骨銘心而已！國家現在已弄到如此地步，試問捨此下策外，還有他法麽？（二）至於美國妨碍中國主權，則不知何所指而云然。除了我們自願給他公斷權以外，似乎尙無類似蘇聯在東北的情形發生，乃共黨不責彼而責此，未免太不分輕重了！（三）美軍駐華的工作為遺俘及助理中國接收主掖，這二者恐怕還算後者重要。現在日軍固已受降完舉，然而東北尙成問題，老實說，美國不願東北成為東亞巴爾幹。美軍的駐華，目前，正是一種安定力量。除了別具用心的共黨外，沒有人討厭美軍此時的駐華。（四）共黨又說美軍為政府運兵，足以擴大內戰。我們想假使政府沒有收復長春，根本連談判的餘地都沒有。似使沒有美人為我運兵，別說接收東北，怕連華北也休想踏入一步！那時的局面，豈堪設想？我們得承認事實，正由於靑島大津等地的駐紮美軍，所以才沒有使華北內戰擴大；由於東北國軍力量的加强，才留下了今日談判的地步。假如美軍為政府運兵是錯誤的話，那麼共黨也請想想「東北聯軍」是怎樣成立的？如無此始作俑者，在東北根本就不能發生國共問題。共黨如此厚責於人，雜責於已，天下人不盡是可欺的</p>
<p>最後，籥請左傾的知識份子們注意，你們攻擊美軍武裝了政府軍，如何却還逼着政府承認蘇軍在東北所武裝的匪徒呀？你們攻擊政府對談判未有誠意，却為何讓共軍猖獗於東北而又在山東各地發動戰事啊？你們片面的論斷，只助長了共黨的氣熖，於國於民，絲毫無補！</p>
<p>這是什麽時候？這是什麼世界？請求知識份子拿出良心來，認淸事實，別再為野心家吶喊助威了！魏伯翹，六，廿。</p>
<h3>從遼陽到四平　七日四平航訊</h3>
<p>— 關榮欽</p>
<p>七日四平航訊</p>
<p>和少數友人匆匆握別，記者坐着馬車趕到火車站去搭下午二時班車。在遼腸，居留了四十多天。要是預知要待這麽久的話，必然會煩躁起來。可是，說起要走，記者又有點不捨。老實說，記者是不喜愛遼陽那五步一處，十步一座的障碍物和防禦工事。却是喜愛遼陽那障碍物和防禦工事以外的好些東西。不錯，遼陽出過幾個「鼎鼎大名」的漢奸，如于冲漢。袁金凱之流，他們以東北同胞血汗建築的大厦——于家·袁家·還巍然站在這古老的山城，抹去了不少山城的色澤，可是抹不掉她先天的美好。</p>
<p>滿眼綠油油　有田不得種</p>
<p>健康地聳立西站的唐塔，牠挨過了多少的風雨冰雪的剝蝕！百年又百年，看來還是那麼「老當益壯」！又看那也是掛滿了歷史的皺紋的文廟：孔老夫子和「七十二賢」的牌位的周遭庭院，那處不掛着鋪着綠茵茵的草木？也許是由於牠靜悄悄站在城東的一角，遊人就少，踏進廟門，要不是你穿着咯咯叫的革履的話，你準會連蒼蠅飛蚊子呌的聲音也聽得到。其幽美處恰好與車聲轔轔塵飛沙舞的街道，成個絕好的對照。還有，也是站在城東的武廟——關帝廟，魁星樓，牠們的周圍不錯是佈滿了工事，鐵絲網，電網之類，象徽着不安的東西，可是，你也不會忘記，遼陽委實是遼寧省建城最早的縣城，連瀋陽也不及它的歷史的悠久。</p>
<p>從遼陽北上，（僅能到四平街，）和從遼陽南下一樣：鐵路沿綫，滿眼是綠油油的草木，臨風招展，一回想起兩個月前的情景，將使你有飄入另一世界之感。為着防匪破壞交通，當局早就下過令：這裏的鐵道兩旁五裏內，不准種禾。一邊五甲，兩邊相加就是十里。這得請管鐵道的人算一算，看看東北不能種木的土地一共有多少？在　饉閙得人獸相食的國度裏，居然還有有田不得種的現象，除非傻子聽到才不覺得怪！</p>

<p>從遼陽到四平，得經過好幾個大站：就是蘇家屯。瀋腸。鐵嶺和開原，蘇家屯地方是不大，可是蘇家屯火車站，却是我國第一，世界第三，其大可想而知。牠是否有這麼大，還得查查，我只知到站時從軍廂窗眼望出去，就看到平列着密密的路軌，看個眼疲神倦，也看不盡頭。瀋陽自然也是個大站，不過平列着的路軌却不及蘇家屯之多。鐵嶺也算大站。從遼陽到瀋陽一百八十里，從瀋陽到鐵嶺是一百二十里。據說：從前鐵嶺也是個工廠區。不過，這「前任工廠區」的縣城，給記者的印象僅是近郊一些空光光的大房子，外表巍然，可是從黑焦焦的窗子看進去，一點也想不到牠們原來是工廠。要不是預先有人吿訴我：我將懷疑那些房子是鬼屋，給怕鬼的人們燒過了。鐵嶺市內，街道還整齊，兩旁都有綠樹，很有規則地站立着。日僑舊貨攤佔了兩三條大街，那邊人潮似海浪，老在擠來擠去。</p>
<p>開原分兩城　相距十八里</p>
<p>從鐵嶺到開原才六十里，火車一小時就到達。開原分新舊二城，其間相距十八里。新城較舊城強多多，這當然是因為日僑住宅區在新城之故。新開原是前次國軍攻四平打西豐等地的立脚點，目能國軍雖然已前進得遠遠了；可是還留下好些後方補給站。給這些「站」裝威風的是堡壘和鐵絲網。開原新城的市街是齊整的不過因為復員不易，好些地方還找不到端緒。舉個例來說：這裏的土地戶籍册簿，為撤退的八路帶走，產權糾葛多所不淸，往往得憑縣長或財政科長等人去處分。留居的日僑，漸次撤回本國或聚居一地，空下來的整潔住宅，有的因為目前的鐵路員工佔居，有的則用木板釘封着門窗，木板的上面則貼着「××警官住宅」或「××隊附住宅」之類的字條。沒有撤離的日僑繼續出賣帶不走的衣物，便宜東西不少，可是一過投機者的手，便市價數倍了。畫籍還是賤，五元一斤，買者寥寥。有些日人不想書籍落我同胞手中，就付之一炬。好些學生分組巡邏，專索將被投入火堆的書，以充實他們學校圖書館。</p>
<p>戰火已靜熄　地雷還在響</p>
<p>瀋日段客車，於六月一日通車了。記者在五月廿八日就從開原坐軍用專車到四平。</p>
<p>四平和東北其他城市一樣，分兩個區域：邊是日僑區，另一邊是「滿」人區。建築，衛生，兩個區域都大不相同。站在又高又長的「大橋」一望：西就是日僑區，東就是「滿」人區。前者稱「道西」，後者稱「道東」。道東有高大的建築，街道齊整寬敞而平坦，街邊有高可數丈的錄樹。現在是「住亂」了，地方還是整潔。道西則少有高大的建築，街道雖然還整齊，可是連石子路也不易找到。溝渠不淸，穢物處處，樹木沒有，低給妓館則觸目皆是。戰火已熄，已大半個月了，可是共軍埋下的地雷，還日夜在「轟轟」的呌着。作戰期間，平民無辜死去的，據說有數百人。散步街頭，城郊，不時還聞到屍臭，聽到哀訴，那燒得只賸下個黑焦焦的骨架的火車站，那千孔百瘡的近郊建築物，尤為人們所不忘。</p>
<p>訪省府要人　談復員現狀</p>
<p>記者為着明瞭當地復昌現狀，曾去拜訪地方當局：首先去拜訪省府劉主席。不巧得很，他却因公外出，只得投刺請見民政廳廳長張式綸氏。日理萬機的張廳長，接見記者時像是那麽的安閒，登時就給我一個異常深刻的印象。張廳長說：省府是五月十八日遷返四平的，一到，馬上就辦公。本來，省府布本年一月八日已接收完畢，可是蘇軍撤退後，共軍馬上來搶。省府指揮下的保安隊，曾不顧兵力的薄弱，武器的窳劣，起而抵抗，從三月十二打到三月十七日，終以實力縣殊而退守了。共算犧牲了七百人，傷者近千，省府劉主席以下人員，泰半被俘。打這一回雖說是敗仗，可是以省府本身武力單獨抵抗共軍，却是光復後的東北的破題兒。談到共軍之所以要死搶四平，死守四平，張廳長說有三個原因：第一，他們看到東北問題，政府勢將由政治談判方式以求解決，為着增强他們在談判席上的力量，就得在四平，長春幾個大地方拚死打一塲，好表現表現自己的實力；第二，四平是東北的要衝，是東北政治上與軍事上的關節，據之，可以打斷北上的國軍的聯絡，幷策應長春及其附近的共軍；第三，四平仍有敵偽殘留下來的物資，他們想着要掠奪。談起省府內部工作人員問題，張廳長說荐任級以上的，多來自後方，委任級以上的，則多取材當地：這幷不是用人有彼此之分，而是由於常地人員（其中有不少是大學生）在偽滿時代，很少有過比較重要的工作的經騐。說到各縣接收和治安情形時，張廳長說：遼北各縣都已接收完畢了惟有通遼一縣，則以治安欠佳，權設縣府於遼寗省境內。各縣的治安都無多大間題。最後談到接收問題，張廳長說，所謂接收，不過是那麼幾幢半破半整的房子，物資則少之又少。</p>
<p>不過，據楊市長的答復是：「做，總得去做；即使做得慢吧，也較停着不動好。我們得創造環境」！</p>

<h3>問糧貸案</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>糧貸案還在偵訊期中，時日已遷延得很久，老百姓們雖然很焦急，希望早日有個水落石出，但想到司法的進行程序，總要調查明白，證據確鑿，才可以定　，所以還能耐着性子。</p>
<p>然而以為用拖的辦法，可以把大事拖成小事，小事拖成無事，那就錯了：老實說，這次糧貸案倘不能辦個一淸二楚，其後的影響，眞不知伊於胡底了？</p>
<p>現在街頭巷尾，由竊竊私議而大聲嚷叫的大有人在，他們說：偽組織那樣黑暗貪汚的時期，還辦了一椿后大椿的案子，大快人心，抗戰勝利了，在國民政府一貫厲行剷除貪汚政策之下，相信決不會含糊了事的。</p>
<p>令人由納罕而疑慮的，是兩個機關在搶辦這件案子，對此，我們倒不一定堅決主張交給哪一個機關辦，法院也好，警備司令部也好，但有一個原則，却是我們所堅持的，那就是必須公開，必須秉公處理！</p>
<p>昨天汪任兩糧官已解到警備司令部，據說偵訊時，在若干糧商及汪達人的口供中，曾涉及糧食部及部長徐堪各點，軍法處業已去函糧部調查眞相，惟尙未接獲復文。</p>
<p>我們建議警備司令部，應一該即日傳訊徐堪及糧食部有關人員，我們知道去年重慶的黃金舞弊案，財政部部長兪鴻鈞即被傳到過法庭，到庭作證，所以我們相信徐部長一定會挺身而出，使這件案子的偵訊工作早日得以完成，否則，人們又將怎樣想法呢？</p>
<h3>關於龍華會</h3>
<p>— 楊鴻年</p>
<p>馬皇帝出走絕非事實</p>
<p>在天津那樣的都市要，居然能讓這所謂「一心大道龍華聖敎總會」在光復後照例的存在着，這不能不說當局的寬大。本報十七日載，八日天津航訊，雖然描寫的很詳細，但多着眼於戰時，及光復後，過去的情形，很少着眼，故願將所知公開一下，以響讀者。</p>
<p>戰前的天津市，是所謂特殊化區域，尤其是日本租界，更充分的利用時機，來製造這「特殊化」總樞。日本浪人，特務機關，無時不在利用這一般狼子野心家在扮着各樣面孔，來替他做些麻醉人民的勾當。但說起來，這「龍華會」的起源，郤遠在山東長山島。所謂「馬皇帝」，也就是島上的一個大戶。不曉得受什麼人的慫恿，他居然在這小村裏做起迷夢。起先確是變賣了自己家產，作些急公好義的善事。同時山東人，正在為了韓復渠的「淸鄕」，而抱怨着因為韓復渠以「以毒攻毒」的政策，利用一般匪首，做淸剿的領導人，所以，難免有些狐假虎威的事情。「馬皇帝」也就利用這一機會，大量的拉進不少信徒，進入他這敎門的人。這些敎徒必須先將全部家產捐作敎產，這樣才使財當平均。叩其一律的待遇，也確使忠心於他的人逐漸增多。慢慢地，他的野心開展，由村而鎭，由鎮而縣，這樣使他毫不費力佔據了整個長山。這時候，日本特務份子，大量接濟軍火，並派人協助，指揮，所以「馬皇帝」的威名，在山東竟會應過韓復渠。如果有人還記得韓復渠在山東的「夜不關門」政策，他為了淸剿「土皇帝」也不能說沒有功績。但這功績的後半節是留給日本人的。像利用溥儀似的，日本人看「馬皇帝」不能立足山東，特地派一條運輪艦，將他接到大連，後又接來天津日本租界。大約在民十八年，在桃山街，須磨街轉角處，才掛起這「一心天道龍華聖敎會」黃旗。另外還有一旗上書「真大靈山活的」語頗費解。前旗之一字，寫成—，另外並有一旗稱之為「真主」及應改年月歷書等邪說。這時他的敎徒們，大多係四十餘歲者，（其中亦有十餘歲者祗數人），衣藍布道袍，左襟，布鞋，布襪，留辮，千篇一律。少聞其誦經，黃昏時多站門外，對過街暗娼，打情駡俏，頗不乏人。</p>
<p>廿六年國軍南撤，天津淪陷，該會會首，曾率徒衆，結隊遊行術頭，而自行安座「別克」轎車穩　其後。作類似呼號之聲，而不辯其究係何語，頗使人疑其非人。後該會佔據南市大舞台，亦曾利用開辦粥廠，遍地寫捐，凡大商店，及士紳均被訂有捐額，實則利用權勢，而非善舉也。報載陶雲祥稱：「馬皇帝已於廿四年出走」恐非確實或有意掩護也。其誇耀興辦慈善事業掩護地下工作人員猶滿口雌黃。如果該會也能掩護地下工作人員，日本特務機關也許更便利些了！總之，這並非是什麼左道邪敎，而是有十足政治作用的一個組織，希望當局注意。同時，更望天津市民檢舉，過去的一切，能有更多的檢舉，才能使當局更好於處理，故將所聞錄之。</p>
<h3>論「小紅」</h3>
<p>— 曹作漢</p>
<p>曾有做索引的考據家說：「紅樓夢中的小紅，是影射明朝的漢奸淸朝的功狗那位兩朝大員洪承疇。」我非胡顧之門徒，對此話不便置一辭。不過，如此比擬，總有點委屈小紅，也覺得有點委屈洪承疇。</p>
<p>「人　望高處爬，水向低處流，」原是世俗　情。試看小紅在怡紅院的時候，祗是做些外圍工作，幹些外房子內的粗生活，寶二爺的身邊事，都由襲人晴雯麝朋秋紋等人做了；還有其他的老媽媽大丫頭之類，把一個核心包圍得堅騰騰的。沒有機會登堂入室去親近主子，自得不到主十的信愛，奴才們如得不到主子的信愛，又怎麽能在奴才中走紅，而壓倒別個奴才。何况小紅又是個搔首弄姿，自顧不凡的人，如何能安於無聲無色的默默無聞的境遇。</p>
<p>為了不辜負自己的才華，她在等待着表現自己的機會，以冀派點「竄頭勢」。正如剛拿着文憑的學士碩士之類，總想能够敲開社會的大門，沐猴而冠一翻，這心情很可原諒的。</p>
<p>可惜小紅的命不逢時，機會很少，難得有一次乘虛的踏入核心，向寳二爺獻了點慇懃兒，郤又很快的給寶二爺左右的親信奴才排擠而去，晴雯還對她連諷帶駡的兜頭澆上一盆冷水，她仍然被轟回外圍了。</p>
<p>這在心高志大的她，如何能够忍受？所以一得到鳳姐的靑睞，馬上就樂效犬馬之勞的爬上高枝兒。換了個實力派的主兒，總算是克達初志了，雖然仍未滿足兒女私情。</p>
<p>洪承疇呢，情形可就不同。他原是明朝的國家大臣，皇帝對之又異常的親信，一般人也望之為國家的干城，如其欲竭盡忠忱的話，是有無限度的機會來發揮他自已的才能，皇帝不會委屈他的才華的。但是他却倒戈降敵，做了皇帝的叛徒，做了民族的漢奸，把明朝的錦綉山河，送給了異族。</p>
<p>因此兩者相較，洪承疇可說是君子中的小人，眞小人似比偽君子可愛，所以小紅似比洪承疇高明一點。</p>
<p>小紅不像洪承疇，那麼她像誰呢？</p>
<p>如不顧「效顰」之譏，我說：她很像民元以來的失意政客落伍的軍閥。</p>
<p>試展討一下民元以來的國內斫殺史，至北伐完成前止，每一役的興風作浪，實際有些什麼意義，値得你死我活的爭個不休，但，却又不斷的鬥爭斫殺，祗是幾個自負才華不甘冷漠的野心家，在求一味的表現自己而已。</p>
<p>今日上台，明日下野；今日聯甲，明日倒乙；有奶就是娘；此處不留爺，自由留爺處；五花八門的攪得天昏地暗，祗是幾個不安於奴才命運的奴才在挑撥攪鬼而已。這一篇胡塗帳，祗有他們才能算得明白。</p>
<p>然而，小紅似還較他們強點，所以精明強幹的鳳姐才加以賞識，一篇「奶奶太太」帳，李紈都給攪得頭昏，她却水銀瀉地似的說得頭頭是道；不甘於冷落，似也不可苛責。</p>
<p>祗是沒有才能而又不甘冷落的人，將怎樣呢？結果是害了別人又毀了自已，民元以來的政客與軍閥就是一個例；所以我深為無小紅之才能而有小紅的抱負的人危懼。</p>
<h3>三層樓看客</h3>
<p>— 儲蘭夫</p>
<p>名票名伶演義戲的第一天，彷彿是一個衝動，下午四點半，我就趕到天蟾門口。出乎意外的鐵門早已拉上，人們都在那武裝警衛的帶着幾分尊嚴的鐵門外面擠軋着，塞滿了整個的馬路。最性急的人，擴在前面，抓住那鐵的欄千，不肯放鬆。張大着嘴，注視裏面，有如久禁的囚徒，在鐵窗裏面渴望自由一樣—這些人都是跟我一樣，三層樓看客，祗有二千元的購買力。</p>
<p>我不覺噓了一口氣望門興歎，打算回去。一面悔恨自己太遲了點；一面却又阿Q地為自己的二千元慶幸。正在猶疑，却碰到一位曾在這個劇院裏看後門的朋友。他瞧我道付勁兒，就說：「別走，停會我送你上去！」可巧那鐵門又開了一綫，於是那朋友就拉了我，趁着人潮一湧而進。我們並不是走的正路，正路上可了不起，查票的地方有武裝帮着，誰沒有票，攆出來。我們算是走了私。</p>
<p>不曉得是怎樣走的，總之我跟這朋友到了三樓看戲的地方，可了不得！整個的樓上已經擠了二分之一以上的人，那進口的地方，還在不斷的涌進來。急急忙忙，我在第五排上占了一個位置。看看鐘，才五點的樣子，冷冰冰的台上，豎着一塊又像客氣又像諷刺的吿牌—「八時開演，」！望下看，正廳和二樓都是很整齊的空着一排排的坐椅，一個人也沒有。</p>
<p>而我們的地方却變成了熱閙的海。女招待們忙着泡茶，「謝謝你……」邊喊着，邊軋來軋去。賣零食的哭喪着臉托着他的貨盤，因為他給人擠得不能動彈。拼命給人留着位置的人，跟後進來的打算佔用的人紅着報項吵架。三四個人爭着拿一架望遠鏡向空的舞台瞧…空中迷漫着烟霧，揚溢着各色嘈雜的音響閙成一片。我自幸得了一個位置，跟前座的一位中年人撩天。「你來遲了，我是一點半就來了！」他彷彿很滿意自已的位置，打着上海官話對我說。</p>
<p>「好大的毅力！」我不覺贊歎起來。其實，我的毅力何嘗小？從五點到八點，在這個熱閙而又寂寞的海中堅持了三小時，自己也不知是怎樣打發的。凡是三樓看客—誰的毅力都不算小。</p>
<p>未開演前的　鼓聲，也激起了人們的彩聲，戲以「大旱之雲霓」的可愛姿能進行起來。「打漁殺家」很給我以感動，那漁夫和他的女兒，給惡勢力逼得去殺人的場面，是够深刻的；舊劇裏這樣的戲不很多。這戲演過，舞台上陸續出現了許多特別看客，道些人一例的整齊漂亮摩登，他們瀟洒文雅的舉止，和輕鬃閑散的神態，和我們這輩人比起來，眞有「天上人間」之感。</p>
<p>戲在進行了，然而我却給這些高等人引誘去了大部分的注意。一位高大的紳士給了我更大的趣味，仙使我記起了一篇報紙上論人的面形的幽默文字。那作者說：「奇形怪狀者是貴相，有許多貴人或富人確係是豬形的。」這位紳士有力的證明了那位作者的意見。</p>
<p>戲很快的收了場，隨着人潮擠出劇場，整百輛的汽車，停滿了幾條馬路，等着迎接它們的主人。在車輛的夾縫裏，拖着十二分疲乏的身體，我盤算着，什麼時候才會有一個合理的藝術欣賞塲所。</p>

<h3>迷於女人　敗於女人</h3>
<p>— 馮憶</p>
<p>論金磚案主犯陳元盛的犯罪心理，不外生活靡亂，見財起意，於是最初迷於女人，最後亦是敗於女人，酒色財氣四字害了他的一生，常他被捕的一剎那，猶在把壼獨酌，未料到「以酒澆愁愁更愁」，禍已臨顯。</p>
<p>論到陳之年紀，正當三十而立，一生中的黃金時代，不幸自己不會利用自己「無限的黃金」，而一門心思想抄捷徑，發橫財，結果偷了國庫「有限的黃金」，終至身　囹圄。如果想到一失足成千古恨，再回頭已百年身的兩句老話，陳常不勝感槪。如此說來，陳之腦筋組織，似嫌簡單，正所謂自作聰明，反被聰明誤！</p>
<p>再觀乎陳於案發後，在杭蘇嘉一帶，尋花問柳，日夜與女人鬼混，硬充闊少，現出一副滿不在乎的神氣，正所謂色不迷人人自迷，想不到到了佛門聖地靈隱寺前，猶未點破迷夢。袋裏的金條落在山溝裏，還勸人性命要緊，不要下去檢，如果我佛有靈，亦將不免唸道：「空即是色，色即是空」，阿彌陀佛！</p>
<p>短短尋歡一月，到頭來飽嘗鐵窗風味，不免受盡牢中烏氣，為陳着想，未免付的代價太大。酒色財氣，可不愼哉！</p>
<p>瀋陽報載：「瀋陽人買報，十分之八九並非為讀報而買報，大多數人都是以紙張的好壞和多寡作為置報的標準，是不管報紙內容好壞的」。其實上海人買報又何嘗不然，我疑心美國的紐約時報與紐約每日新聞銷數百萬份，是不是亦與日出十歲大張有關？</p>
<p>馮玉祥將軍這次從重慶到南京，捨機而登舟，到南京之後，不談政治而專談水經，似乎對水發生了大大的興趣。這大槪是由於受命出國考察水利而引起的一點靈感。據說馮氏曾說：「中國的問題，祗是水利問題，蔣主席治黃河，我來治長江，兩個地方治好，中國也治好了。」</p>

<p>近來常聽見一般靑年學生們設：「國事險惡到這般地步，讀畫有甚麽用處」？又在某大學的牆上看見一幅漫畫，畫着一本畫上面放着幾個骷髏頭。靑年們在習慣上已經是不大要讀書，現在更得到了理論上的支持。於是他們就在道種「愛國至上，讀書無用」的口號下正式與書本宣告脫離關係，踏上了政治的征途。這是中國敎育界戰後的現象。</p>
<p>據炎國新聞處華盛頓廿三日常科學硏究發展處以大批科學文件移交與國會圖書館，以之免費分贈全美國各大學以及各圖書館。這種文件都是科學硏究發展處戰時偉大硏究計劃的結晶。其間包括物理雷達無綫電設備，火箭，化學，光學，電氣交通，海底作戰等。這種報吿文件對於科學家，敎育家，及各部門實業家，將大有貢戲。這可以代表美國學術界在戰後動態的一斑。</p>
<p>在這兩種情形對照之下，我們可以看得出來，人家是希望以科學建國，因為要替科學建國打基礎，他們要普遍的研究這些科學報吿文件。而在我國領導靑年的先生們似乎在希望以政治建國，因為要替政治建國打基礎，於是他們忙着指揮靑年學生寫標語，遊行示威。我們倒幷不一定是不贊成學生參加政治活動，我們也知道政洽不上軌，一切的其他的發展都是要受到阻礙的。不過我們要請今日靑年的領導者注意三件事。第一，請你們要矯正道種讀書無用論的思想，指導靑年們多讀點書。因為沒有見識的行為是盲目的。第二，請你們注意靑年們在學識和能力上的發展應是多方面，而不要只是機械的灌輸一點政治上的主義，我們特別要希望靑年們多注意科學上的研究報吿，為中國的工業化，打下一個很好的基礎。第三，在你們指導靑年們讀書的時候你們的目的在帮助他們追求眞理而幷不是向他們傳敎。</p>
<p>最復，我引用高爾基的一段話獻給中國愛好活動的靑年們：</p>
<p>『愛好書籍吧，它會使你的生活變得更加容易；它將會友愛地帮助你辨明思想感情與各種事件的多樣而複雜的混淆；它會敎你去尊敬別人和你自己；它會用對於世界和對於人類的愛而替你的理智和心靈上插上翅膀。</p>
<p>讓它和你的信仰作對吧，假如它是用對於人類的愛和願望人們生活得美好些的心意而真誠地寫出來的話，——那末這就是一本好的書』！</p>
<h3>評中國政治思想史</h3>
<p>— 趙震</p>
<p>（第一册）蕭公權著　商務印書館出版</p>
<p>凡讀過蕭公權政治學上的多元論（Hsiao　Kung－chuan：Political　Pluralism　A　Strudy　in　Contimporary　Political．Theory．N．H．Harcourt　London，1927）的人，對於蕭公權都有很高的期待。政治學上的多元論是卓越的博士論文，列在國際心理哲學與科學　書中出版到現在，將近二十年了。在這幾年中他似乎很沈寂，除了在淸華學報英文天下月刋中偶或見其文章外，我們很少機會得見其著作。最近蕭公權在商務出版了他的新著中國政治思想史了，這是一部很値得注意的好書。關於中國的政治思想史，坊間所流行的已不在少數，但它們都有一個共同的毛病，就是它們都是站於某一個偏狹的觀點上，斤於爭辯思想家的階級，身份；學說的唯心唯物；東抄一句，西摘一段，幾如善博者之「呼盧成盧，喝雉成雉」。至於能把握一個思想家的整個思想體糸，而作融會貫通的「述學」著作，那就只有蕭公權的新中國政治思想史了。蕭氏的這本書「叙述各家思想，力守客觀之態度，偶有論評，亦意在辨明其歷史上之地位，非敢任意抑揚，臆斷得失。」</p>
<p>全書共分五編，計廿五章。第一編封建天下之政治思想—創造期，第二編專制天下之政治思想（上）—因襲期，第三　專制大下之政治思想（下）—轉變期。（上）第四編近代國家之政治思想（上）—轉變期（下）。第五編近代國家之政治思想（下）成熟期。</p>
<p>著者之分此五編，並非偶然的，是有原則的。著者（甲）按照思想演變之大勢，把二千多年的中國政治思想分為四大階段：（一）創造時期—孔子至泰之統一中國，為時的三百年，通稱先秦時代。（二）因襲時期—自秦漢至宋元，為時約一千六百年。（三）轉變時期——自明初至清初，為時約五百年。（四）成熟時期—自三民主義之成立以迄于今。著者（乙）再按照思想發生之歷史背景（政治史）在，而劃分為下列之三時期：（一）封建天下之思想，包括春秋戰國時代，與上述之創造時期相當。（二）專制天下之思想，包括秦漢至明淸之二千年，與因襲時期及轉變時期之前部相當。（三）近代國家之思想，包括淸末維新運動及辛亥革命以迄於今，與綠轉變時期之後部及「成熟時期」相常。把甲，乙兩種分期合而觀之，則成上述之五編了。本人書第一册即專門闡述先秦時代的政治思想。</p>
<p>著者以為中國政治思想有一共同特點，即以「天下」為對象，「天下觀念之含義略近歡洲中世初期之世界帝國」。中國古人缺乏列國並存的國際觀念，抱「政治唯我論」之見解。還有一個特　是大同主義，「忽略族類之區分，重視文化之同異」，其結果遂致二千年間，中國勢盛，則高唱「用夏變夷」之理論，外族入主，則遷就政治屈服之事實，祗須征服者行中國「先王之道」，同化於我，則北面稱臣，承認異類之政權，亦毫不愧恨」。這是證明中國人只有「文化偏見」，沒有「種族偏見」。「總上所舉各端，一言以蔽之曰：缺乏近代國家之觀念而已。……所謂近代國家至少其有下列之數特點：（一）樹立民族自主之政權，（二）承認列國並存，彼此交互之關係，（三）尊法律，重制度，而不偏賴人倫道德以為治……（四）擴充人民參政權利一端，亦可認為近代國家特點之一。此四種品性，吾國當專制天下之時期固完全缺乏，即在封建犬下之分割時期〔即先秦時代〕，亦僅略有痕迹，似是而非。二千年政治思想之醞釀衝激，不能產生近代國家之觀念一。　結何在，很可使人猛省。</p>
<p>著者認為晚周政治思想所以發達、巧由於「社會組織之迅速變遷，與偉大思想家之適生其會。」晚周是封建天下轉為專制天下之過渡時期，在此過渡時期，「政治思想之可能態度不外三種：（一）對將逝之舊制度表示留　，而圖有以維持或恢復之，（二）承認現狀，或有意無意中迎合未來之新趨勢而為之張目，（三）對於一切新舊之制度均感厭惡，而偏重個人之自足與自適。……儒墨兩家同屬第一類，法家諸子屬第二類，道家之老莊及一切「為我」之思想家，獨善之隱君子，則皆屬於第三類。先秦之主要學派是儒墨道法，這四家就其政治思想言之，可分為三大派：「一日人治派，儒墨屬之」；「二曰法治派，法家為其代表」；「人治與法治二派，皆為積極之政治思想。其取消極態度而並與二派對立者，則為道家所代表之無治派」。</p>
<p>關於各家學說發生之先後，著者認為「今日文戲之不足，此實為一甚難之事。然考證先秦學派之先後，其途有二：一為發源之先後，一為成立之先後。」照這樣說法，中國思想史上所聚訟不決的老子的年代問題，就可以迎刃而解了。著者說：「本書於道學之淵源，及老聃之降生，姑從舊說，假定其在孔子之前；老子成書，則從多數學者之說，假定其在孟子之後。」</p>
<p>著者以為孔子之成就，為「根據舊聞，樹立一士君子什進致用之學術，復以此學術授之平民，而培養一以知識德能為主之新統治階級。」「孔子政治思想之出發點為從周，其實行之具體主張則為「正君」，以今語釋之，正名者按盛周對建天下之制度，而調整君臣上下之權利與義務之謂。」「孔子所謂仁，乃推自愛之心以愛人之謂：「孔子言仁，實已冶道德，人倫，政治於一爐，致人，己，家，國於一貫。」「孔子之治術有三，曰養，曰敦，曰治」「養敎之工具為「德」「禮」，治之工具為「政」「刑」。「德禮為主，政刑為助。」孔子認為國家之目的不僅在養民，且在敎化人民，在化民成俗。化民成俗的方法是（一）「以身作則」，（二）「以道誨人」。著者以為「孔子思想中之「政」，不僅與近代學者所論者不同，且與古希臘柏拉屬之說亦有區別。近代論政治之功用者不外治人與治事之二端。孔子則持「政者正也」之主張，認定政治之主要工作乃在化人，非以治人，更非治事。故政治與敎育同功，君長與師傳共職。……柏拉圖亦以道德為國家之最高境界，其「哲君」之理想亦近於孔子政敎貫通，君師合一之主張。然柏拉圖之哲君為一尙智之哲人，孔子之君師為一尙德之仁者。君師以德化人，哲君以智治國，其為人與操術俱不相同。」著者認為儒家政治思想之特點是「以敎為政」，「以個人道德之發展為政治之最高理想。」所以其治術雖禮義與刑法兼用，而仍以禮義為主。</p>
<p>著者講孟，荀，墨，老，莊，管，商，韓諸子，政治思想，亦有許多深刻，精微，獨到的見解。我們為篇幅所限，不能一一介紹給讀者，不過從上面所引關於孔子的許多論斷裏，亦可略見其一斑了。照我們的看法，本書有下列的好處：（甲）立論之平實謹嚴——本書措辭極沈靜，沒有過火的言詞，沒有誇張的論調，凡是想在本書中尋求精神上的刺激（Intellectual　Excitement）的人，不免要覺其平淡無奇而失望的。（乙）剖析義理之精微——著者對於各種學說之貌似相同而實相非者，剖別極為精細。例如先秦的法治思想與近世歐洲的法治思想，初看之似乎差不多一樣，其實都是不同的。著者說得好：「歐洲法治思想之眞諦在視法律為政治組織中最高之權威。……故法　高於君權，而君主受法律之拘束。……其與吾國先秦「法治」思想以君為主體而以法為工具者如兩極之相背。」又如道法二家初視之亦近似，其實很不同。「黃老論治之要點，無過於淸淨無為，法家諸子固亦時發其義。……管子日「虛無無形之謂道」，「名正法備則聖人無事」，凡此諸語，若置之道德經中、，未必覺其不類。」然而著者認為道法之異至少有三大端：（一）無為之方術不同。法家之致無為，「則欲由明法飭令，重刑壹敎之方法以臻「明君無為於上，羣臣竦懼乎下」之境界，其操術正為老子所說「其次畏之」之第三流政治。…老子以放任致無為，申韓以專制致無為」。（二）無為之目的不同。「黃老之無為，其目的在立淸靜之治以保人民之康樂；法家諸子則敎君主行無為之法術，以鞏固君主之權位而立當强之基礎」。（三）君主之地位不同。老子「放任寬容之極，則君主等於虛設，威勢無所施用。申韓思想中之君主，則為始皇混一前夕之專制火君，集威勢於一身，行賞罰於萬衆。……故（法家所謂）無為者乃「藏刑匿智之別名，不可與歙歙為天下渾其心」者相提並論」。（丙）「脚注」甚多——著者對於本書所用功力之深，可自每章中脚注（foot－notes）之多見之。每章所加脚注都在百條以上，商子與韓子一章竟有一百四十二條之多。這些脚注或標明「引用語句」之來歷出處，或補充發揮譽中之所未詳者，這在國內出版的學術著作中是不常見的。本書還有許多好處，但著者却謙虛地說：「撰者學殖荒落、而本書屬稿値抗戰期中，參考圖書又頗不便」。其實這醫眞是抗戰期中，國內學術界上的一個收獲。我們希望本書的　　其餘各冊能早些與我們相見。</p>

<h3>「貨幣與物價之研究」</h3>
<p>— 張振聲</p>
<p>蔣廷　著　作者書社經售</p>
<p>利到現在已經十個月，而民生的痛苦，依然如故，各地的物價均仍繼續上升，因此而演成罷工及怠工的風潮，加之外貨源源而來，所有生產之工廠已至極危險之境界。凡此種種，其原因固不止一端，但除政局外，即為貨幣與物價問題。故最近對於貨幣與物價討論者頗多，但大都均限於一時一地之作，或對於外匯，或關於物價指數，或叙述一地物價之情形等，對於貨幣與物價整個問題之著作，則尙未之見。蔣先生對於本書之作，確很適合目下之需要。</p>
<p>全書共分八章，計（一）貨幣槪說，（二）物價槪說（五）信用與通貨，（四）通貨之價値，（五）物價漲跌之原因，（六）貨幣數量說，（七）物價漲跌之影響與物價政策，（八）我國近代物價漲跌之槪况。在第一二章內，將貨幣與物價詳細分析說明，使對於研究貨幣與物價者，先將本問題認識淸楚。然後再進而至第三四章硏究貨幣之演進而與物價問題所發生之種種關係。至第五六章則硏究物價漲跌之原因，將各種之學說詳加伸論，再參照事實而成立一種新學說，即蔣先生在本書內所創之貿易數量說。在第七章內則將物價漲跌之利害及應用何種物價政策詳細分析說明。至最後第入章復將我國歷年來物價漲跌之情形詳為叙述，而作舉證。全　前後一　，層次分明，對於學理與事實均加研究，使未曾硏究貨幣與物價者，獲得一極好之入門書本．</p>
<p>考各國對於貨幣與物價之學說至最近為止，當以貨幣數量說為最著。雖此說有各種之缺點，但至今尙無比較再確切之學識可將此說推翻而代之者。今蔣先生在本書則將此說推翻而創貿易數量說以代之。蔣先生說：「貨物在貨幣未發明前，早已存在，但昔日之貨物並非經貨幣相交換，故並無物價問題，將來世界科學進步，則近代之通貨或許將來完全廢除，而代以其他之方法，亦未可知。若到彼時，則物價自亦不成其為問題。但貨物之需要，則人生所不可缺者也，科學無諭如何進步，對於貨物之需要，祗有增加其種類，而更趨複雜，決不能打破貨物之需要而能維持生活也。故物價問題之重要性在於貨物，不在金錢或通貨也。……通貨不過一種手段，借以作為交換之媒介耳。」又說：「貨幣經過不少次之變遷，最近硬幣已趨淘汰，各種交易大都均以信用通貨與貨物相交換。……故在近代物價問題中之貨幣，已漸失其重要性，而成為物價問題之重要因素，除貨物外，即交易是也。不諭其用何種方式之交易，如不相交易，即不生物價問題。惟各種之交易雖並不均用貨幣相交換，但作為交換計算之標準尺度，則仍以通貨之數量為表示，故物價問題之基本要素，除貨物外為貿易之數量。』此種理論確有獨到之見。蔣先生又以為貨幣週轉率祗能適用於硬幣時代，而在信用通貨時代，常以貨物流通率以代之。此說亦頗為確當。並且蔣先生按照理論與事實又排成貿易數量之公式為：</p>
<p>QPC=E</p>
<p>故蔣先生在本書內不但介紹不少貨幣與物價之各種學說，日發前人所未發，而推翻英國學派克思斯氏之存餘數量說，與美國學派費許氏之交易數量說而創立一種新學說以代之。故本書對於一般已曾硏究貨幣與物價問題者，實為一增加硏究資料之極好書本也。</p>
<p>本書對於叙述事實旣詳細，分析又淸楚。在第一章內對於貨幣之沿革，將中國及其他各國之情形，要言不煩，　述頗詳。在第二章內關於物價指數之意義，功用，及計算方法等，均逐一說明，頗為詳盡，使讀者即可明了指數之功用及其算法。第六章內對於貨幣數量說之源起，及歷年來各國學者對於貨幣之各種學說均詳為伸述，讀此即可明了世界各國對於貨幣學說之演進狀况。在第八章內對於我國自民國以來之物價漲跌情形及其原因，分為二期，自民國元年至二十四年為第一期，自廿五年至最近為止為第二期，每期詳細分述，並附有各種極有價値之指數表。故本書對於一般硏究貨幣與物價問題者，又為一不可多得之參攷書本也。</p>
<h3>「霜葉紅似二月花」評介</h3>
<p>— 姚隼</p>
<p>茅盾先生的這部長約百五十餘萬言的巨著「霜葉紅似二月花」，第一部約十五萬字，已經由華華書店印行了。這是以民國十年間——五四時代作為背景，對當時的社會作個詳盡的描寫。舊的社會受着時代潮流的盪激，已經開始動搖了，但反動的勢力正在作着有力的掙扎，迴光反照，這經霜的葉子正和春花一樣地殷紅。</p>
<p>茅盾先生把這故事安排在都市附近的一個小縣裏，這可以淨除浮面上的事物，而使人更能看淸當時中國社會的情形，而也使主題更為突出。</p>
<p>這裏有着舊的地主階級和新的資產階級間的衝突，勾心鬥角，明槍暗箭；這裏有着較有正義感的智識靑年的徬徨和苦悶。作者把這些連串着，交織着，寫成了一首動人的史詩。</p>
<p>作為舊的地主階級的代表的，是趙守義和他的一羣，他霸佔着善堂十多年來的積存，不肯把賬目公佈，而作為他的對手的，新的資產階級的代表者王伯申和他的一羣，却籍口舉辦貧民習藝所，要他把吃到嘴裏的肥肉吐出來，但趙守義馬上來個反擊，內為王伯申的輪船公司的輪船走在淺水的內河裏，使得河水時常冲毀岸邊的民田，趙守義便派他的爪牙徐士秀和曹志誠慫恿農民打輪船，王伯中用警察彈壓，打死了一個鄕下小孩，這事情弄火了，但他們却和解了，一邊的本錢是吃虧的鄕下人，和一條小孩的人命，一邊的本錢是善堂的公積，公家的財產，而吃虧的仍然是老百姓。</p>
<p>徬徨着，苦悶着的智識靑年，首先是張府的少爺如，他的家庭替他娶了現在的少奶奶，但他却傾心於他的表妹許靜心、他老想出外做點事業，但他的祖母却要他在家裏守住祖業；他不滿於現狀，但却又無法改變目前的環境。第二個是恂如的姊夫黃和光，他有儘够溫飽一世的家財，他有美貌而多才的嬌妻，但為了他生理上的缺陷，不能曲盡丈夫的天職，更無法傳宗接代，並且因此吸上了雅片，弄得萎靡不振，而他又不甘於就此斷送了一生。第三個是恂如的表兄錢良材，在這三個主角裏頭，他是比較有為的一個，他有熱情。有勇氣，一心想替地方上做點事情，情願犧牲自己的利益，常輪船冲毀田地的時候，他反對曹志誠他們慫恿鄉民打輪船的舉動，而敎本鄉的農民縮地築堰，犧牲了少數低窪的田地，而保全多數人的利益，損失的則由大家分攤，他懷着「對大家有利」的信念做去，而當他明白了大家是不大願意而却又服從他的時候，他的自信又在幻滅了。在趙守義和王伯申雙方的鬥法中，他也從中出顯，想把一條小人命換得地方上的一　公益，但結果是他作了難人，而佔便宜的，還是趙守義和王伯申，他的徬徨和苦悶，是比恂如和光他們更為深沉的。</p>
<p>為什麽當時的改革運勁一事無成呢？書中的一位不合時宜的紳縉朱行健說：「……我們學人家的光化電，多少還有點樣子，惟獨學到典章政法，却完全不成個氣候，這是什麽緣故呢？……」</p>
<p>這是什麼緣故呢？黃和光說：「我想，世上是不好不壞，可好可壞的人太多，這才縱容壞人肆無忌憚罷？」</p>
<p>「為什麽一個人會成為可好可壞？……如果是他不認識什麽是好，什麽是壞，可又幹麽人人能說什麽是好什麼是壞？旣然能說，為什麼不能做？」錢良材問着：「你，我，我們三個，到底算不算可好可壞的一夥？如果也是可好可壞的，有沒有自已想過，倒底是什麼緣故？」</p>
<p>在當時，朱行健錢良材等人，只能够理解到這一點，矛盾先生並沒有更進一步在這裏說敎，而把這一問題留了下來。</p>
<p>霜葉紅似二月花，到現在，也還不是那麽殷紅麽？時代又推進了二十餘年了，對於這個問題，難道我們還照着錢良材他們那時的看法麽！</p>
<p>茅盾先生的小說，我覺得是吸收融化着中國舊小說中的優點的，譬如這「霜葉紅似二月花」，對於故事的安排，先是由瑞姑太太回到張府和老太太的閑談中作為引子，把出塲人物的家世叙出，又藉着人物的移動，把故事帶到另一個塲合中去，層層發展，最後用婉小姐抱螟蛉女的塲而作個總結，一氣呵成，毫不牽強。又如對於人物的處理，他用正面的描寫。從別的人物的嘴裏的側而的襯托，以及主人公本身的對話，辯論和分析，使每一個人物個性和性格，都非常生動和凸出。這些，都是我們在舊小說中常常看到的。這種例子在本書中很多，這裏因為篇幅的限制，不能够詳加列舉。</p>
<p>茅盾先生的文體，是以白描見長，明快·平穩·細緻·逐層發展，一點不牽强做作，也沒有故作驚人之筆，而是深沉的，寫實的。這文體，不是細心的讀者，是不客易體會到的，因之而覺得有點沉悶。</p>
<p>吳組湘先生評「霜葉紅似二月花」有點「論文化」，這是指書中的許多辯論和分析而言的，但這些却可以藉以表現出人物的思想和個性，這是舊小說的特長，只要不落入心理描寫的臼窠中，這種手法是可以採取的。</p>

<h3>記丁西林</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>在五四以後不久，看到好幾種初期的通俗劇和鬧劇，淺顯易曉；忽然看到丁西林的「一隻馬蜂」，便覺得突出同儕，耳目為之一新。它給我們的是一種不尋常的新鮮感覺。這集子是幾個獨幕劇的結集，裏面的對話，漂亮，幽默，兜着闂子說話，不僅不令人討厭，反而使人喜歡。許多雋妙的話句，眞　他想得出來。其中「壓迫」一篇，是最流行的，不知曾有多少劇團上演過。我曾經拿他的「北京的空氣」一篇，選入我的「初中混合國語敎科書」中，作為修辭學及語格的舉例，因為這一篇處處說僕人好，其實是處處說僕人壞。</p>
<p>為了耙念五四文藝節，中華全國文藝協會决定邀請這一位五四時代的作家來演說，並且演他的「壓迫」；在這上海閙房荒的時候，重演這戲，也很有意思。前兩天我便特地到中央研究院物理硏究所去看他，先事接治。這時正下着濛濛的細雨，我雖感到一點不方便，還是懷着一顆興奮的心前去。終於我在一間會客室裏看到他踏着安閑的步子走來。頭上白髮已經很多，和藹的笑容使人有慈煦的媽媽的感覺。我頓時變成小孩，沐浴在溫暖的光輝裏。他吿訴我文藝節那一天要到南京去，中央研究所在那兒建築天文台，須去看看，雖然不曾邀請到他，而後來「壓迫」也沒有演成，但能够有機會看到我所仰慕的作家，心裏總是高興的。我仍舊踏着濛濛的細雨走出那一座樹叢潤濕的花園。</p>
<p>也是一側濛濛的細雨天，在夜間，我披上了雨衣，到卡爾登去看丁西林的新作「等太太回來的時候」的上演。凑巧西林坐在我前一排，正在聚精會神地看他自己親手培植的創作。先演一個短劇「三塊錢國幣」。這兩個劇本都寫到僕人，却與「北京的空氣」不同。前者叙少爺小姐拉女僕坐下，一同喝茶，女僕在謙讓之後，便不安地坐下來了。後者叙一個大學生為了不滿一位女主人辭歇女僕，而洩憤地打破了她的另一個花瓶，再賠她三塊錢國幣，因為這是她定下來的要女僕賠償打碎花瓶的價格。這兩點都說明了作者是怎樣一位同情於女僕的遭遇的人。</p>
<p>「等太太回來的時候」寫的是父親做漢奸，大女兒與女壻附和着他，但妻子，兒子，小女兒對於這件事都反對，結果是三個反對者的出走。兒子在一個早晨整理行裝，預備瞞着母親出走。不料母親却下樓來對他說，地那整班行裝的聲音任誰也可以驚醒，還吿訴他，她已經買了三張船票，她自己與小妹妹也跟他一同走。臨走時她騙大女兒，說是把兒子押着去取回行李，又給了女僕很多錢，女僕莫名其妙，問大小姐，大小姐要她「等太太回家的時候」來問太太。</p>
<p>這戲劇還是抗戰第三年編的，倘若當時環境許可演出，一定可以引起觀衆激昂熱烈的鼓掌；民族正氣是永遠應該提倡的，但現在觀衆所處的時代和要求都已經不同了。淺薄的我，看「妙峯山」雖不甚懂，像不懂曹禺的「北京人」一樣，但我嘉歡「妙峯山」，這裏面藏着「西林獨幕劇集」一貫的作風，想入非非的事件與對白給了我一種新奇的刺激。現在的這兩個戲劇作風却與以前不同，似乎已由絢爛而歸於平淡，或者說，更多的接近寫實，很容易懂，平易近人。大約丁先生感覺到抗戰大力的推盪，耳聞目擊了許多可歌可泣的事件，便秉着正義寫下了這大義的戲劇。這時他不暇顧及他的按巧，他不願再用那些小聰明，只覺得有一股磅薄的力量在催促着他寫，他便一口氣寫了下來，直到戲快寫完時，鬆了一口氣，纔又想起了「西林風」，因此也就在末了給了我們一個不尋常的結束。</p>
<p>戲演完以後，兩林立起來，替他的太太扣上雨衣的鈕扣。我與他握手吿別，趁便問了他幾句關於劇本的話，他頗惶惑，火約怕人發現或注意到他是誰，這正看出他的謙抑，他不是胸間插着百合花招搖過市的王爾德。</p>
<h3>野貓（小說）</h3>
<p>— 池沼</p>
<p>這幾天放學後帶着三個孩子從學校回家，還未就讀年僅五歲的蘭兒，總有許多新聞告訴我們聽。他呶着小嘴，揮着小手說：</p>
<p>「今早，樓下姆姆買了兩隻鷄鷄！」</p>
<p>「枇杷果七百塊一斤，前樓嫉嬸買了一大簍！」</p>
<p>「阿葉今天中午吃了兩隻粽子！」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>他每次的結語是：「爸爸我們也買！」那時食指老放在小嘴內，顯現出馋涎的樣子。</p>
<p>蘭兒這些話，他的三哥哥和二哥哥最感覺興趣，也聽得最入神，可是每當蘭兒說：「爸爸，我們也買！」大哥哥總會拉着他的小手擾亂他說：「弟弟和你說去！」</p>
<p>看了馬路上和鄰家的悄形，我也知道快要到端陽節了，然而……想到那問題的時候，對孩子們天眞的要求，我總是沉默着。人兒馨是個十二歲的孩子，生長在貧困的環境裏造成了他憂　的性格，也許因為他的年齡比三個弟弟長大，所以也像多懂些人情世故，他往往是做了家庭中排難解紛的八。然而，每當我想起大兒那種受磨難而成的「少年老成」的性格，我會為之惋惜。</p>
<p>是端陽的的大前夕，夜深了，妻巡視了四個孩子憨睡的狀態。舒一口氣躺在床上，那時我課卷也批改完了，她說：</p>
<p>「後犬就是端陽節了，孩子們這幾天看到人家買東吃西，眼巴巴的望着，怪可轔的，我們也要買些應個景兒。」</p>
<p>「唔！」我在沉思着。</p>
<p>「樓下二房東買了一斗糯米、裏了一百多只粽子，前樓也買了五升，其他像鷄枇杷果都買好了。我們也該買二升糯米，二斤枇杷；鷄雖然買不起，也該買二斤魚肉吧，而且孩子們也個把月不吃肉了，過時過節也該讓他們高興高興，單看人家吃着，怪可憐的。」妻在滔滔不絕的又說了一大堆話。</p>
<p>說到孩子的可憐，做父親的那有不體會的道理。而我家的四個孩子，因平時習慣了不是「有朮必應」的境遇，所以也特別聽話，說的，吃的，都遵着父母的指示，從沒有嚎啕頓足要吃要玩的。可是，一想到照妻那樣說過一個節就要花去兩斗米的價錢，兩斗米不是可以支持一家六口餐粥餐飯十天的口糧嗎，我躊躇了，我更沉默了，我想起自己是個士大夫階級末落的今日的一個窮敎師，每月只有數萬元的束修，一個月的生活也支持不了，何來這筆例外的花費。</p>
<p>『你，你的意思怎麽樣？』妻像不耐緘默的催促着我的答案</p>
<p>我嘆了一口氣，我起床拿起紙烟抽着，四個孩子憨睡的姿態映入眼廉，我走近他們床前輕撫着他們—他們那營養不足的臉面和肢體，我終於答應了妻的建議，幷且說費用不能超過一萬元。</p>
<p>在燈光下，我看到妻那操勞過度因而瘦削枯黃的臉上　起了紅暈，緊蹙的眉也開展了，她還像忘了一天疲勞興奮地說：</p>
<p>『到了節日，魚肉一定比平日更貴，還是明早先買來燒好待到過節那天吃。』</p>
<p>第二天，孩子們一起來，妻就將今天預備買的東西吿訴他們，最小的三個孩子都拍着小手，可是大兒還是像無動於中的，催領着他們洗盥去，而蘭兒却連臉也不抹了，他趕忙走出房去吿訴他同屋的小同伴說：</p>
<p>『我們今天買魚，買肉，買枇杷果，紮粽子。』他說得沫花四測的。</p>
<p>「鷄鷄呢？你們買不買？我們有鷄鷄。」樓下的小囡在問他</p>
<p>蘭兒便趕着走回來拉着妻的衣角說：</p>
<p>「媽媽，我們買不買鷄鷄？」他睜大眼在等回答。</p>
<p>「買，買，什麼都買！」妻還沒有回答，大兒　氣憤憤的搶着說了。</p>
<p>「買，買，什麽都買！蘭兒也搶到扶梯口在對樓下的小囡說。</p>
<p>當放學回家，妻已裹好了粽，燜好了兩火碗紅燒肉，還有一段　魚，枇杷果不用說也置來了。</p>
<p>紅燒肉怪可愛的，給醬油熬得黃澄澄亮晶晶地，一塊一塊像「麻將牌」的樣兒一股兒的香氣，引起了幾雙小眼睛向它眨着閃着。</p>
<p>吃晚飯了，為了孩子們不能忘情，只好准每人先吃兩塊紅燒肉，小臉上都浮滿了笑意，蘭兒們只把肉吮着來送飯，捨不得吞下肚去。</p>
<p>「今天肉價二千五一斤，算起來値一百多塊錢一塊，你們仔細嘗嘗。」妻在說着也得意地露出笑容了，大兒却吐出了舌頭。</p>
<p>「去年端陽節，用偽鈔的時候，也不過一千五一斤，今年又漲一千了，近幾天來樣樣小菜都漲價，　呌人吃菜根也難！」妻又在感慨地說。</p>
<p>飯後，替孩子們洗換好了，妻又考慮到放置魚和肉的問題，因為天氣熱，假使放在櫉裏，恐怕會引起腐壞，豈不可惜，所以結果還是決定放在靠窗的桌子上，那地方又通風是最妥當的。</p>
<p>孩子們記掛着第二天起來有好東西吃，早已酣然熟睡了，妻忙碌了一天，而且今天更像做完了一件大事也呼呼地睡着。我更像盡了最火的責任，心安理得地也睡得安穩，只給在　合上吵鬧的貓兒吵醒了一次，推着旁睡的妻，她竟是像無知無覺的。</p>
<p>端陽節的早晨，當我還未醒來的時候，却給妻和孩子的說話聲吵醒了，我覺得好像出了什麼亂子似的。</p>
<p>『什麽事，一早就吵？』我問。</p>
<p>「爸爸，爸爸，肉和魚給野貓偷吃了，」孩子們在嚷着。</p>
<p>「媽媽昨晚把魚和肉放在桌上，給貓吃掉了！」大兒也露出埋怨的口吻說。</p>
<p>我爬起床來，見妻正露出懊喪的樣子，兩眼也潤朗多了，我　那截魚已沒有了，兩碗肉，每碗都去了一半，不覺也發怔起來。</p>
<p>「吃去那許多，一定是不只一隻死貓吃的。」妻在喃喃地說。「二千五百元一斤差不多吃了一半，還有那一截魚也買了二千五百元。」妻在嘆惜着。</p>
<p>我本想說昨晚已聽到貓在吵閙，可是恐怕妻和孩子們要怪我，所以只好改換口氣安慰他們說：</p>
<p>「還好，還好，只吃了一半。」</p>
<p>事後，妻和我商量，她說這件事不能宣揚出去給同居和鄰人知道，因為給貓吃掉魚和肉，照理只要再　便了，可是我們那裏再能買得起，若是不買豈不叫人笑話，所以這件事還是不給人知道的好，只能餓着腸胃挺起肚子裝體面了。三個大的孩子還懂事，却恐怕蘭兒漏了嘴，所以妻在恐嚇着蘭兒，說這種事不許對人說。蘭兒的小心靈裏，也像家裏發生了大事一般，終日只悶悶的，果然沒有對人說起。</p>
<p>對於妻的建議，我雖然是不贊成，可是想到自已不能離羣獨處，更為了同情妻的遭遇，也就沒有說話了，只可憐孩子們也給妻敎導了撒謊。</p>
<p>那天，我們是閉起門來吃晚飯的，妻和我只默默地聽着鄰舍和同居喝酒拇戰的聲音，孩子們却仍是高興的，因為還有給野貓吃　的肉吃，還有枇杷吃，還有</p>
<h3>筏</h3>
<p>— 劉旭滄攝</p>
<h3>寄</h3>
<p>— 仁佺</p>
<p>朋友！</p>
<p>雖然是僅僅一天，却像一個世紀那麼冗長呵！</p>
<p>從今天早上我們在××堂前握手道別的時候，直到現在我一人在家裏靜寂的燈下寫這化，我像做了一個迷惘的夢。似平是渺茫，但確然是實在的。雖然是實在，但又夢似的輕遠。縱使知道這是無可避免，必須迎着的事實，然而越喜歡像回味一個夢境似的去捉摸它。現在是得到結論了——我現在起一個人端坐在燈下寫着信，眞像我們在幾年前進宿舍的初夜給父母寫平安信一樣。</p>
<p>昨天晚上你睡得好嗎？我　怕你會招了凉。雖然各人都因興奮而忘了寒冷，而夜風却是帶着秋氣的。「如此星辰非昨夜，為誰風露立中有」可是誰又能捨這在母校相叙最後的一晚呢？上天也似乎特地為我們安排了道最美最動人的一晚。幾天來沒有見面的月亮，却在昨夜漏臉了。而且還帶給了我們最愛撫最溫柔的照臨，讓我們浴在她慈愛的光裏，恣性的吵鬧，盡情的談笑。四下的市聲都已死寂。祇風息在樹梢低吟。我們年靑的笑聲漾溢在母校的懷裏，它將永遠的響着。在每個六月十五的夜晚它將久遠地成為萬古的回音。</p>
<p>終於我們又見到了月蝕；這在我們中間許多人是一個新奇的經歷。可又眞巧，在昨夜会讓我們見到了這天界的奇象。常我們看着那滿盈盈的月亮給陰影吞沒下去的時候，我們都覺得黯然。就是這麽很快的　了又缺了麽？使我們又想到將要這臨到我們身上的離別的那件事來。我們還凄然地掉了淚；為了從梳小辮子的時候起到一同畢業这段友誼，對着這美麗的宇宙，我們掉淚了。明亮的淚花，將會結起來，照耀着迎我們而來的許多許多的日子。我以前曾有過這麽一句「丈夫淚，只向山河　。」今夜，我覺得這淚也掉得値得了。</p>
<p>星移更轉，我們還是谈着，笑着。各人的眼前都浮現着美好的將來。在至高，美着的希望裏，我們確立起我們的信心。為什麼我們不能使今夜成為將來迴憶裏最有意義的一夜呢？默默的，我們都立下了担負起使這世界變得更好一點的工作的誓願。現在我們，又感到了偉大的和渺小的存在。雖則我們許多人中有一些極微小的恩怨，從現在起，我信，都應從大家默默相印之中，輕輕的放開了。</p>
<p>在人的一生中，多的是一些嚴肅和美好的責任；這些責任，都是不知不覺的給我們負起，又不知不覺的給我們完成。以前，進學校的時候，我們還不懂事，只知道跑跑跳跳，笑笑鬧鬧啊。然而在無意，無形之間，我們已担起了一個嚴肅而美好的責任。我們是為着求學，為着要充實自已，敎育自已。現在一個階段可吿完成了。在幾年淪陷期間共同相處的同學要分手了。在不知不覺之中，我們又搭起另一個嚴肅而美好的責任來，那就是互愛，友誼。假使我們能勝任，我們就完成了一件宇宙間最有價値的工作。假使我捫之外無量數的人都能勝任，這世界將會變得更適合於人類居處一點。</p>
<p>昨兒晚上，壓根兒我就沒有好睡過。在夜深深的時候，似乎聽得有人在幽幽的吸泣。心中眞太煩了，祇得連連默誦着「惜往日」裏的詞句，直至昏昏的睡去。夜又太短了。</p>
<p>朋友，我們應該總是在一起的。</p>

<h3>彫刻室隨筆（二）</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>彫刻的種類</p>
<p>以材料來分，彫刻的種類頗多。——木彫，石彫，泥塑，Terrcotta，乾漆，鑄金，牙彫，鐵筆等。</p>
<p>木彫與塑造東洋較西洋為多，且技術特殊而有味，歷史亦悠久。木彫在西洋的作法，必先塑泥型，再以泥型翻為石膏而後依樣模刻（其石刻製作程序亦同）。東洋則不然，如各廟宇享堂的木彫佛像，大多是以一根整木，憑空彫刻，有時另加手足，其形態雖不如西洋之寫實，但，古樸莊嚴之神情，遠非西洋作品所及，塑造在東洋，尤其是中國，另有夾苧古法，遠如唐代楊惠之塑於蘇州角直所塑之佛像，距今近千年尙完整如故，此亦非西洋人夢想得到的事，因為塑造在西洋，僅不過作為習作或鑄金與石刻木彫的母型而已。木彫所用之木，樟，檜，櫻，桂，朴，黃楊皆宜，在我國一般善男善女彫彿像講求聖潔虔誠，有時用檀香為之，不過為數甚少，樟不易蛀，黃楊易人刀，櫻紋較美，其他各有優劣之點。作者亦各有所好。西一洋中世紀木彫為寺院裝飾甚多，現代擅長木彫之作家亦不少，馬育（Maillol）可算是興趣較濃的一個。郭　（P．Gauguin）在泰地也作了很多土人風的木彫，頗有趣味。</p>
<p>石彫，西洋古代埃及希臘甚多，其作多用意大利卡拉拉特產的白大理石，質細膩澤潤，製成彫像極美觀。近代作家所作亦多，羅丹（Rodin）亦喜用之。中國古代石彫亦盛行，宋以後，就漸次衰落，明朝雖仍有人提倡，但為數極少。今尤存者如金陵之明陵前之石人石獸，其技術因受匈牙利影響與唐代又路有不同</p>
<p>乾漆彫，是以陶土鋸木層拌生漆塑造者，杭州靈隱寺之濟公像，即取此法，年久不裂，堅固異當，近年已為日人襲用，國人反不重視。</p>
<p>鑄金，無論東西洋，古代均極興盛，其製作即如上述，必先塑泥型而後翻為石膏，再翻為砂模而後熔金屬物為液體灌人始成，金銀銅鐵錫鉛均可為之，普通以靑銅較多，製作手續甚為煩瑣</p>
<p>牙彫，西洋中世耙多取之彫作聖母像，中國明淸間亦多利用彫作觀音像，中西藝術無形中發生了共鳴。</p>
<p>鐵筆彫，因其彫刀如筆，用以彫刻竹器，東方人擅此技者甚多，興趣亦較濃，也許是產竹之故。</p>
<p>Terrcotta，是用陶士所製，製成後人窰燒成的一種彫刻，西洋近年頗盛行。我國宜興亦有之，惟皆出於匠工之手，故趣味低級。</p>
<p>由彫刻的技法分門別類的話：那又有立體彫，浮彫。凹刻，綫刻數種。普通所見凡周圍無物面面可觀者謂之立彫，浮彫與凹刻是彫刻與繪畫混合的一種產物，同繪畫一樣祗能看一面，所不同者就是除給人視覺的賞鐵外，還多一種觸覺。綫刻，以其說它是彫刻母寗說它是繪畫好得多，因為它僅是用的工具不同而已。</p>
<h3>愛的看法</h3>
<p>— 鋆</p>
<p>中原君在本報春秋欄上寫過一　　名「母親」的文字，我看了好像字裏行間充滿着至性的面淚。當我講完最後一句時，心裏一陣難熬眼淚跟着掉下來了。當然啦！也有着與中原君的同橡母愛，而母親也離開了人間，可是，我沒生花的妙筆，能給描摹像中原君的那樣生動文衆。我對愛的看法，認為人類任何的愛，總比不上母愛的偉大。自來母愛其子，可說無徵不至，眞愛洗露，所至披糜，績者誰都可以體味，惟獨世上頗少子愛其母，甚有　母的，這比較還是女兒輩來得順從和體貼．你該知道，你不愛你的母親，回頭你的子女就不見得把你妻子作母親看。因此，在一個家庭中，我們首先要把愛妻子的愛，移到愛母親的身上，一來用以報答，是應有的。二來做一榜樣，先給妻子看，再給兒女學，不是很對麽？</p>
<p>男女之間，祗可說上一個私字，私者，自我之見，並不純潔，也無至性，揭穿了說，逃不出互相利用而已。談不到情，更沒有什麽愛，所以母愛，才是人類眞正的至愛</p>
<p>我希望像中原君所作「母親」一類的文字，多多在報上發表，使一般不了解母愛眞諦的，對愛的看法或能轉移其視綫。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（六六）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>墨太太少不得安慰了翁二太太一番。好在自己的心情，並沒有受到傳染，她還是為無限希望的憧憬而快活着，對於剛才石玉樓的話，她不十分了解，她也不需要了解。她現在所唯一記罣的，是明天的榮耀，她想像着明天麗華登台以後，全戲園子的觀衆都為麗華鼓掌叫好，於是，戲園經理來向她伸出大姆指，要求和她訂合同。從此，麗華變成了這戲園子的紅角兒；從此，她每月可以得到「包銀」；（優伶固定的酬勞。）從此，她的一生無憂無慮了！想到這裏，不禁笑逐顏開地替麗華預備了新年穿的長衣服，又把麗華與到眼前，親切地撫着她說：</p>
<p>「小華，明天你就十歲了，明天你第一次登台！可千萬別叫媽失望呀！要好好地唱，用心地表演。三天以後，你師父說：就可以正式「下海」了。將來掙了錢，媽讓你吃好的；穿好的；享一輩子的福。」</p>
<p>麗華不作聲，她似乎沒有聽見墨太太的話。</p>
<p>「孩子，上了台可別害羞，有你師父給你作胡琴，還像在家裏一樣，該怎麽唱，怎麼唱；該怎麽表演，怎麽表演；一點不要慌；不要怕。」墨太太又殷殷叮嚀了一回。</p>
<p>麗華照舊啞然不語，眼看着天花板，臉上露出漢然無關的神氣。</p>
<p>墨太太見麗華不言語，以為她是睏了，便催着她去睡覺。</p>
<p>「早點睡去吧，明兒早點起來穿新衣裳！」墨太太說。</p>
<p>麗華這才「哼」了一聲，走開了。</p>
<p>事實上麗華一點兒也不　，她的腦子裏起伏着雜亂無章的思潮。但她並不覺得有什麼傷心之處，她只是覺得奇怪！奇怪墨太太為什麽不用別的方法叫她「掙錢」？她知道可以掙錢的方法很多，譬喻她去替人家當丫頭；她會掃地，洗碗，抱小孩，她並不以為這些就是吃苦。她還可以到裁縫舖去替人家縫縫衣服邊，做做粗針綫。她看見裁縫舖裏有許多年靑女孩子在那裏做着工作。但墨太太偏不！！單選了一條唱戲掙錢的路！剛才石玉樓還說過！唱戲是給人家「解悶兒」這明明不是好事體，連石玉樓都怨這行了；而墨太太反倒叫她幹這行；什麼道理呢？她不懂！可她也不願違抗墨太太。她打也挨了，罪也受了，旣然學了這行，就只有幹這行！致於想到明天登台的事，她也只有茫然的感覺。她記得她看過石玉樓在台上唱戲的情形；她，還有許多人；都在台下瞅着石玉樓，而石玉樓像沒有看見他們似的，儘管唱他的。那麼，她明天也要在台上唱，讓許多人在台下瞅着她了。她會羞嗎？但羞也不能不唱！於是她便決定：也只好學石玉樓那樣，像沒有看見許多人似的，儘管唱自巴的。</p>
<p>「唱戲分明是給人家開心的玩意兒，而壞妹妹自己錯把唱戲當作了「玩意兒」！」</p>
<p>麗華自言自語地說。她理解了這個意識，想到麗華把唱戲當作玩意兒的幼稚，又不禁好笑了。</p>

<h3>The Three-Person Meeting Continues to Adjourn Yesterday and Today to Study the CCP's Counter-Proposal on Troop Reorganization. Marshal Ma Held Separate Talks with Yu and Zhou Yesterday.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Three-Person Meeting continued to adjourn for another day today. Given his past experiences, Special Envoy Marshall believes that for major and complex issues, if sufficient preparations are not made beforehand, holding meetings will not only be a waste of time but also affect the emotions of all parties during the meeting, thus missing the fleeting opportunity. However, when Special Envoy Ma issued the notice late last night, he only scheduled a one-day adjournment. Today, due to the US and government representatives needing to conduct a thorough study of the CCP's counter-proposal on troop reorganization submitted today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] The Military Three-Person Meeting is scheduled to continue its adjournment for another day tomorrow. Zhou Enlai is scheduled to visit Marshall at 11:00 AM tomorrow. It is also reported that the delay in discussing the troop reorganization issue is because the CCP's counter-proposal has not yet been submitted. It is now learned that the CCP's counter-proposal has been drafted and was delivered to Marshall this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Zhou Enlai spent from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM this afternoon discussing the troop reorganization issue at Special Envoy Ma's residence. Tonight, Special Envoy Ma will meet with Foreign Minister Yu for discussions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Representatives of the Democratic League Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, and Luo Longji went to Meiyuan New Village at 9:00 PM tonight to listen to a report from Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the CCP Eighth Route Army, on the military situation. At that time, the street lights on Mensheng Street in Meiyuan New Village were dim, and there were few pedestrians. More than ten reporters were waiting under the dim lights for this news, which had not ended by 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Representatives of the Third Force held internal discussions at Fengyi Village at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The results of the talks included two points: (1) They believe that the prospects for peace are facing a critical juncture, and they hope for the success of peace and do not want to create unnecessary complications to avoid affecting peace. (2) They hope that the CCP will submit its counter-proposal on troop reorganization as soon as possible so that the troop reorganization meeting can be held quickly. The former of these two points will be conveyed separately by each representative, while the latter will be conveyed by Liang Shuming to Meiyuan New Village tonight. The Third Force will also have another internal discussion tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] According to reliable sources tonight: Regarding the issue of the powers of the U.S. representatives in the Three-Person Group, the Executive Headquarters, and the Executive Sub-Group, intense debates had previously occurred, but an understanding has now been reached. After one of the most difficult issues in the peace negotiations has been resolved, the representatives can concentrate their full efforts on discussing the issue of army reorganization. It is learned that the Communist Party delegation has submitted proposals on the reorganization issue for consideration by the National Government. These proposals were personally delivered by Zhou Enlai to General Marshall at 2:30 PM this afternoon. Zhou Enlai and Special Envoy Ma had a secret discussion for nearly three hours. It is also learned that he will meet with Special Envoy Ma again at 9:00 AM tomorrow. The details of the understanding on the powers of the U.S. representatives in the China peace mediation mechanism are not yet known, but well-informed sources believe that this understanding is largely based on the Communist Party's proposal, that is, the U.S. representatives have the right to submit independent reports, conduct investigations, and implement the decisions of the Three-Person Group. The point that the decisions of the Three-Person Group must be unanimously agreed upon is still maintained.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Xinmin Bao stated today that the KMT and the Communist Party are willing to compromise on the last of the three issues in Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order of June 6, namely the issue of troop reorganization and stationing. The National Government is prepared to concede on the issue of stationing in various areas, and the Communist Party is willing to make concessions on the points of the February 25 agreement, but requests to increase the proportion of Communist troops in the Northeast. The reason is that the "Democratic Allied Army" in the Northeast has a large number of troops. The original agreement between the two sides on the number of troops stationed in the Northeast was three divisions of Communist troops and fifteen divisions of National troops. Now, the Communist Party is requesting to increase two divisions. The Three-Person Military Group "did not hold a meeting today because the opinions of the two sides are still widely divergent."</p>
<h3>Minister Peng Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters, Hopes That Certain Parties Abandon Incitement Policies, Chairman Has Repeatedly Revised the Plan for Troop Reorganization, etc.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Ministry of Information held a reception for foreign reporters at 4:30 PM on the 26th, hosted by Minister Peng and Vice Minister Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The following is a record of the important questions and answers:</p>
<p>(Question) Last week, when the representatives petitioning at Xiaguan Station were beaten at night, several foreign reporters witnessed it on the scene for several hours. The military police did not make efforts to protect them, as if someone had instructed them. Who should be responsible for this matter?</p>
<p>(Minister Peng's Answer) The government expresses deep regret for the Xiaguan brawl incident. Such acts of violence are absolutely unforgivable. The police failed to disband the two sides who were debating and scolding each other at the station for several hours, and failed to stop the brawl in time. Although it is said that the police force in the city is weak and lacks transportation, making it difficult to mobilize quickly, the failure to protect them is undeniable. The government has dismissed the director of the police station in charge and reported to Shen Cheng, the chief of the capital's police department. After the brawl occurred, a large number of military police arrived and dispersed the crowd, rescuing the injured. We sympathize with the injured and are angry with the rioters. However, we cannot help but mention the similar incident that occurred in Shanghai on the same day. When the petitioning representatives left Shanghai, thousands of demonstrators went to the station to see them off. On their way back, they broke into the YMCA dormitory, arrested several anti-communist students, beat them, tore their clothes, and wrote insulting words on their backs with black paint, tying them up for parade. They held a so-called public trial in a nearby park. These students were also rescued by the same late military police at the most dangerous time. This incident happened just a few hours before the Xiaguan incident, casting an ironic light on the peace and human rights guarantees represented by the peace representatives. I sincerely hope that certain parties will abandon such sinister tactics and not incite the lovely youth or involve the elderly who do not know the outside world in the glory of the mass movement to create a propaganda tragedy. We have heard that similar incitements are being actively carried out. We also want to petition the masterminds behind the scenes to at least reconsider this plan from a humanitarian point of view.</p>
<p>(Question) The Ministry of Information claims that the masses are refugees from northern Jiangsu. If this is true, what is the proof? How many rioters have been arrested? What are their names and origins? Are the refugees really as organized as the masses that day?</p>
<p>(Minister Peng's Answer) Tens of thousands of refugees from northern Jiangsu live near Xiaguan Station, so nearby residents can easily identify them. Eight people suspected of rioting have been arrested. Among them, two have been proven innocent and released. Another two, named Cheng Qiong and Chen Xishu, have been proven to have participated in the riot and will be punished according to law. If you have time, you can visit them. A few days before the riot, the refugees from northern Jiangsu were initiating the organization of an association, which was established on the 24th. During the press conference held by the petitioning representatives yesterday, the Refugee Association formally apologized to the petitioning representatives, as you all witnessed.</p>
<p>(Question) To what extent do you hope to reach a final agreement before June 29? It is said that the Chairman has revised his request regarding the Communist Party's withdrawal from certain areas. Can you please explain?</p>
<p>(Minister Peng's Answer) The three points indicated by the Chairman in the order to cease advance, namely, stopping the conflict, restoring transportation, and reorganizing the army, must be resolved definitely by the end of the month. The Chairman has repeatedly revised his plan to accommodate the Communist Party's requests. At this stage, details cannot be disclosed yet.</p>
<h3>In Commemoration of Chairman's Great Achievements, Huangshan on the South Bank of Chongqing is Renamed Zhongzheng Mountain</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th Dispatch] Huangshan on the south bank of Chongqing City was the location of Chairman Chiang's official residence when he was in Chongqing. The former Chongqing Provisional Assembly requested the municipal government to rename Huangshan to Zhongzheng Mountain in commemoration of Chairman Chiang's great achievements. The municipal government has recently obtained approval from the Executive Yuan and has officially announced that it will be officially renamed from today.</p>
<h3>Communist Party's Huge Sum of 700 Million Yuan Transported from Peiping to Hankou in Succession</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 25th Dispatch] In June, the Communist Party transported funds from Peiping to Hankou, reaching 700 million yuan. The first batch was 300 million yuan, and the second batch was 400 million yuan. It is reported that the funds have been transferred to the Ninth Group to request the military camp to send special troops to Xuanhuadian.</p>
<h3>National Population Statistics: Over 470 Million</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Ministry of Interior announced today that according to the latest statistics, the total population of the country is approximately 470,026,252, including six million people in Taiwan Province, excluding overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>US State Department Reaffirms Mission of US Troops in China: Purpose is to Assist Us in Repatriating Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th Dispatch] A spokesman for the US State Department reaffirmed the mission of US troops in China, which is to assist in the repatriation of Japanese troops in China at the request of the Chinese government. The sole purpose of US troops in China is for this. Previously, according to reports from Nanjing, Mao Zedong requested the United States to immediately stop all military aid to the Chinese government and withdraw US troops stationed in China, hence the above statement was issued.</p>
<p>[Local Dispatch] The scope of work of the US Military Headquarters in China is gradually shrinking, so the number of personnel at the US Military Headquarters is also decreasing. In July of this year, the number will be further reduced. General Mattes, Chief of Staff of the US Military Headquarters, is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States on July 4. General Gillen, the commander-in-chief, will remain here. The US Air Force Headquarters in Shanghai has now been abolished. Air Force Commander Evans has left Shanghai for the United States a few days ago.

<h3>Kui Yanfang and Others Went to the National Government Yesterday to Meet with Chief Secretary Wu, Stating the Purpose of This Trip. Wu Agreed to Convey to the Chairman Kui's Words That the Reporters Have Gained an Understanding of the CCP's Actions.</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Since Kui Yanfang and others held a press conference here yesterday, people in Nanjing have gained a very clear understanding of the eight people from Shanghai, including Ma Xulun.

However, he reiterated that they came here to seek peace, and that the unfortunate incident at Xiaguan was a "misunderstanding."

<h3>He Yingqin and Zhang Jia'ao Arrive in Shenyang, There is a Rumor That the Northeast Military Camp Will Be Changed to a Governor's Office Starting Next Month, Chiang Ching-kuo Seeks to Restore Diplomatic Contact</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 26th Dispatch] The transformation of the situation in the Northeast seems to be taking place behind the scenes. He Yingqin flew to Shenyang with Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department, this morning and may also go to Changchun. It is rumored that he may return south on the 29th. He Yingqin traveled in great secrecy. Last night, his entourage still claimed that He did not intend to go to the Northeast. This mission may be quite important. There is a rumor that the Northeast Military Camp will be changed to the Chairman's Governor's Office at the beginning of next month, with Xiong Shihui as the director and Du Yuming as the deputy director. Northeast elders such as Wan Fulin and Ma Zhanshan will also have appropriate titles. Chiang Ching-kuo's recent return to the Northeast indicates that the government is seeking ways to restore normal diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union in the Northeast, because since the Soviet army withdrew and the war broke out in the Northeast, Soviet diplomats and some overseas Chinese also withdrew with the army, and normal diplomatic contact was interrupted.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 26th Dispatch] Although there were small conflicts on the outskirts of Panyang and Fushun 20 days ago, it is now calm and uneventful.

According to official intelligence, about 5,000 Communist troops from Zhangjiakou Dongkai River and about 30,000 people from Shandong have entered Rehe via roundabout routes. If the peace talks break down eight days later, then these forces may be the new capital for the Communist Party to once again seize the Northeast. The government is also not without preparation. However, under any circumstances, the United States will not give up its belief in and efforts for peace. During the short ceasefire period, US personnel have been working tirelessly in the dust, entering and leaving the line of fire, and have completed some mediation preparatory work. At the moment, the 29th group has set off for Hailong, east of Siping Street, and the 30th group has gone to Haicheng, south of Panyang, to carry out their peace work.</p>

<p>Our Country's Tariff Policy, the Government is Studying Improvements Because All Countries are Adopting Free Trade Policies, We Cannot Use Tariff Barriers to Resist Foreign Goods</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Regarding our country's current tariff policy, many people in the country advocate reconsidering it, because with the import of large quantities of foreign goods, the danger of gradual monopoly in various important markets is increasing, and the future of domestic goods is particularly bleak. This increase in the imbalance in our international balance of payments has a great impact on the national economy. Recently, the financial authorities stated that the import of luxury goods has been strictly prohibited, and unnecessary foreign goods will be taxed heavily. As for our country's current tariff policy, the government is conducting research to improve it. Because all democratic countries are adopting trade policies, in this trend, our country must not adopt tariff barriers to resist the import of foreign goods, but in order to develop our country's industry, appropriate steps will be taken to protect it.</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi's Treason Case Granted Retrial; Prosecutor Files Appeal, Deeming Jiangsu High Court's Ruling Inappropriate</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 26th] Following the Jiangsu High Court's issuance of its Re-Trial Order No. 4 on June 24th, approving the commencement of a retrial in the treason case of Chu Minyi, the Han traitor, the presiding prosecutor Li Shudong voiced his opposition, considering the ruling highly irregular. Specifically, at approximately 6:00 PM on the 26th, he submitted an appeal to the High Court, containing a separate statement of reasons, requesting the reversal of the retrial order. Upon hearing this news, our reporter immediately visited both the president and chief prosecutor of the Court. President Sun stated: "In China's judicial system, the prosecutor's office is independent. As the prosecutor deems this case unsuitable [for retrial] and has filed an appeal, this Court shall, in accordance with the law, consult with the Supreme Court for a final decision." Chief Prosecutor Han stated that decisions made after the third trial cannot be contested, according to the law; the order to retry this case seems to lack a legal basis. Factually speaking, Chu Minyi superficially claimed loyalty to the Father of the Nation, safeguarding documents, but his actions harmed the country's foundation and obstructed the war of resistance. This should not be used as a reason for requesting a retrial. Thus, the prosecutor has filed an appeal, and we will await the final decision of the court of third instance. The text of his appeal is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grounds for Appeal</p>
<p>Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Grounds for Appeal. Defendant: Chu Minyi. Regarding the Defendant's treason case, this Court issued a ruling on June 22nd of the 35th year of the Republic of China, ordering a retrial. This prosecutor received notification on the 24th of the same month and believes an appeal should be filed. The reasons are stated as follows: The original ruling granted a retrial based on the retrial petitioner's claim that the Defendant went to Beijing in the 31st year of the Republic of China to negotiate with the Japanese army for the return of the Father of the Nation's remains, which were then re-interred in the mausoleum. He also purportedly exerted effort in Shanghai to retrieve the Father of the Nation's original manuscripts, such as "Sun Wen's Doctrine" and the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction," which had been confiscated. The petitioner claimed that detailed records exist at the Nanjing Ninghai Road Detention Center, attesting to his loyalty to the Father of the Nation and the preservation of historical documents, which fall under Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases. The original final judgment did not consider these facts, and according to Article 28, Section 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, there should be grounds for a retrial. However, loyalty to the Father of the Nation lies not in the re-interment of the remains but in the adherence to his will; not in the preservation of his writings but in the implementation of his teachings. The Father of the Nation dedicated forty years to the National Revolution, the goal of which was to achieve freedom and equality for China, and the method of which was to unite with nations that treat us as equals and struggle together. The Father of the Nation's will is clear. Since the Defendant, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, conspired with other traitors to collaborate with the enemy, organize a puppet government, resist our nation, and attempt to plunge our people into eternal damnation. This is a fact confirmed by the Supreme Court's review. His actions clearly violate the Father of the Nation's will, constituting the ultimate disloyalty. His negotiation with the Japanese army for the return of the Father of the Nation's remains and the retrieval of the Father of the Nation's writings, like his organization of a puppet government, infiltration of the Nationalist Party, and the fraudulent use of the Nationalist Government's name, served the same purpose: to deceive the people and confuse the public, in order to undermine the war of resistance and oppose our nation. This is a common trick of treacherous officials and villains, exemplified throughout history. If we had lost the war of resistance, and the nation had fallen, the Father of the Nation's writings, even if preserved, would have been impossible to implement. According to Article 3 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases, only when a traitor has provided assistance to the war of resistance or engaged in conduct beneficial to the people, with solid evidence, may his sentence be reduced. Furthermore, according to Article 28, Section 2 of the Special Criminal Conditions Litigation Regulations, a request for retrial for the benefit of the convicted person is only valid if important evidence that could affect the judgment was omitted from consideration after the judgment became final, and there is deemed to be a significant error. The regulations are clear. Even if it were true that the Defendant negotiated with the Japanese army for the return of the Father of the Nation's remains and the retrieval of the Father of the Nation's writings, as stated above, his conduct did not assist the war of resistance or benefit the people. Moreover, the Defendant used the name of loyalty to the Father of the Nation to deceive the people and undermine the war of resistance. According to Article 57, Clause 4 of the Criminal Law, regarding his criminal methods, a heavier punishment should be imposed. The original final judgment considered these factors and sentenced the Defendant to the maximum penalty, and there was no significant error. The petitioner's request for retrial is clearly without basis. The original ruling granting approval is difficult to justify. Therefore, within the statutory period, an appeal is filed, and the reasons are stated as above. Li Shudong, Prosecutor, Jiangsu High Court, June 25th, 35th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Orders Arrest of Individuals Hiding in Japan Who Served in the Japanese Puppet Government</h3>

<h3>Minister Gu and Chairman Wang Arrive in Nanjing to Report on Their Inspection of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Minister Gu Zhenggang and Chairman Wang Maogong arrived in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 26th via the Shanghai-Nanjing express train after distributing flour to refugees in Zhenjiang that morning. They reported to the central government on the refugee relief work in northern Jiangsu and the inspection of Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Taizhou. They will travel to Xuzhou and Haizhou on the 28th to continue comforting the refugees. Before the Communist army brought disaster to northern Jiangsu, most of the refugees in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Taizhou were landlords, wealthy merchants, public servants, teachers, or honest, simple farmers. Later, due to the Communist army's implementation of the "three-all" policy (kill all, burn all, loot all), the "three resources" policy, the "three-leveling" policy, and bloody "struggles" and purges, they fled en masse and became starving and destitute. Even the original small vendors and poor people fled because they did not want to be driven by the Communist army. Currently, the millions of refugees in northern Jiangsu wander the streets all day long, dying of disease and hunger at any moment. They are very grateful for the government's relief, but their urgent request is that the government protect their return home. Thousands of refugees often follow after Gu and Wang, shouting the slogan, "Please protect us so we can return home!"</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei's Son, Wang Wenti, Sentenced to One and a Half Years in Prison, Granted Five Years Probation and Placed Under Supervision</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The case of Wang Wenti, the Han traitor, was pronounced in the Capital High Court on the morning of the 26th. The main text is as follows: "Wang Wenti colluded with the enemy to plot against our country, sentenced to imprisonment for one year and six months, deprived of public rights for five years, all property confiscated except for what is necessary for the livelihood of his family. Wang Wenti is granted five years probation, and during the probation period, he will be placed under supervision." Presiding Judge Zhao Chen explained the reasons. In brief: The defendant was young and inexperienced and followed his father into treason, serving as a junior officer in the puppet government, but he did not take active actions of treason, and his sentence should be reduced by one-half according to law. Furthermore, he mistakenly went astray, and his situation is not without pity, and his sentence should be appropriately reduced. Also, because the defendant has not been given a prison sentence before, he meets the requirements of the probation regulations, so probation is granted. Zhao also stated that during the probation period, the defendant should be placed under supervision and should know to correct his mistakes and start anew, emulating his father's accomplishments in the first half of his life and not dwelling on his father's treason in the second half of his life. After five years, he should be able to graduate from university, and when his probation expires, he can still be a new person who is "has not previously received a prison sentence." Wang Jingwei's son, Wang Wenti, retreated with a "yes, yes," without making any statement. According to the Capital High Court, if there is no retrial, he will be released on bail and handed over to the police station for execution within ten days of the delivery of the judgment.</p>

<h3>Guo Xiufeng's Retrial Postponed, Deng Zuyu to be Sentenced on the 29th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Capital High Court held a public trial this morning of Guo Xiufeng, the former Deputy Secretary-General of the puppet National Defense Supreme Committee and President of the puppet Central News Agency.

<h3>Navy Warship Command's Chief of Staff Wei Jinjing Reports for Duty in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Wei Jimin, Chief of Staff of the Navy Warship Command, set out on the warship Changzhi on the 11th of this month to inspect the defenses of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. While proceeding to Qinhuangdao in the Bohai Bay, he received an urgent recall and returned to his post. On the 24th of this month, he arrived in Shanghai aboard the same warship and reported for duty in Nanjing on the evening of the 26th. The reporter interviewed Wei before his departure, and he provided detailed information. Wei's inspection area extended from Qingdao around the Shandong Peninsula through Yantai, Weihaiwei, the Bohai Bay, and reached Qinhuangdao. According to Wei, along the coast of Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other places, defensive fortifications built by the Communist army were visible everywhere. The bunkers and military works in the mountainous areas were also clearly visible. The civilian ships and fishing boats encountered along the way were all escapees from the Communist-controlled areas along the coast, recounting the atrocities of the Communist army, which corresponded to the facts recorded in the current newspapers. According to the boatmen, the Communist army strictly controlled the civilian and fishing boats in the Communist-occupied coastal areas, and they were not allowed to leave their original mooring locations. If a passenger or fishing boat actually left the port, it had to be guaranteed by three households to return to the original location before it could be released. Therefore, the boatmen along the coast under the Communist rule were extremely miserable.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Attitude of the Chinese People Towards the United States</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the United Press reported from Washington that a State Department official stated: "A report from Moscow Radio claiming that the United States and China have a 'secret agreement' to extend the Lend-Lease Act until November 1947 is factually unfounded here." It further stated that this news may be based on a misunderstanding of the clauses of a bill currently under consideration in Congress; this bill will authorize the President to provide China with military assistance and the necessary supplies for its army, to "fulfill the obligations borne by the United States in the United Nations Charter." Congress may authorize the President not only until October 1947, but also for ten years thereafter; at the same time, if Marshall's peace process proceeds smoothly, the Communist army will also receive assistance before formal unification is achieved. As we read this cable, Mao Zedong publicly issued anti-American remarks in Yan'an, stating that U.S. military aid to China is in fact armed intervention, and demanded that the United States immediately cease military aid to China and withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China. At the same time, anti-American slogans have been found in this city, and there have been incidents of U.S. military personnel being surrounded and verbally abused by a small number of people; the occurrence of these incidents is truly unfortunate. Given the occurrence of such anti-American slogans and behavior, in order to express the general intention of the Chinese people, we must expose the truth of this despicable offensive and express our attitude.</p>
<p>First of all, we must declare that these anti-American slogans and behaviors are the work of a small number of scoundrels and cannot represent the general intention of the Chinese people. In the effort to defeat the Japanese invaders, Chinese and American youths fought side by side; the traditional Sino-American friendship, after this baptism of blood, has become increasingly solidified and close. In terms of the spirit of national founding, national character and emotions, and even geographical environment, no two nations can be as close as China and the United States. Although China's War of Resistance Against Japan has been victorious, the great cause of national revolution has still not been completed; to complete our revolution, we need the assistance of a great brotherly country like the United States. The Chinese people are deeply grateful for the various efforts of the United States in China, especially the efforts of Special Envoy Marshall, the five-star general whose reputation is known to all. If the Chinese people have any feelings other than gratitude towards our great neighbor, it is that they feel that the United States' assistance to us seems insufficient, perhaps due to their excessive expectations. Therefore, any anti-American sentiment is definitely not spontaneous among the Chinese people; any anti-American sentiment also definitely cannot represent the sentiment of the general Chinese people.</p>
<p>The Moscow "Red Star" newspaper published an article on the 22nd commenting on the Chinese situation, criticizing U.S. aid to China and launching an anti-American argument. This is not the first time for Soviet newspapers to do so. "Izvestia," "Pravda," and "Red Star," which represents the Red Army's voice, often have anti-American arguments; the anti-American propaganda offensive that has appeared in China is to some extent related to Moscow's anti-American arguments. Why do we say this? The Chinese people have a traditional friendship with the United States, and this friendship has become even more solidified and close because of the war. The Chinese people themselves will definitely not have anti-American sentiment, this can be asserted. The Chinese Communist Party, in order to cover up its crimes and prevent an impartial third party from seeing the various illegal acts it has committed, and also to echo Moscow's sentiments, has launched an anti-American argument and an anti-American propaganda offensive. This is a tactic of the Communist Party, and this tactic, rather than originating in Yan'an, should be said to originate in the Mecca of the Communist International. Looking at it from a more distant perspective, the anti-American propaganda offensive that has appeared in China is not a spontaneous sentiment of the Chinese people, but actually echoes the anti-American offensives that have appeared in other parts of the world, with each being a connected link.</p>
<p>It is in this sense that the Communist Party's actions are actually a betrayal of national interests. We must raise the awareness of our countrymen regarding the Communist Party. Obvious traitors like Chen Gongbo are now being punished by national law; but there are also invisible or inconspicuous traitors among us. Even though the Chinese people's level of knowledge is relatively low, they have the ability to distinguish obvious facts from the past. The Chinese people also have a clear understanding of who is their friend and who is their enemy, and their inner tendencies cannot be concealed.</p>
<p>What we find even more interesting is that the anti-American arguments of the Moscow "Red Star" newspaper and Mao Zedong's anti-American remarks not only echo each other remotely in terms of timing, but their content is also completely consistent. Is this really the voice of the Chinese people? We hope that the Chinese people will use their discerning power and stop being an echo of a third party; those who blindly follow should understand how they are being used by others and delaying national affairs, and should turn back as soon as possible. As for our American friends, we trust that they have the ability and wisdom to discern this disguise. Due to the unfolding of this international anti-American offensive, the people of China and the United States should have a deeper understanding and a closer partnership; the maintenance of world peace is built on this foundation.</p>

<h3>Amidst Territorial Disputes in Southern Yugoslavia, U.S. Warship Arrives in Trieste, Strengthening Forces to Prevent Incidents; Hopes for Success of Four-Foreign Ministers Conference Appear Stronger</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 26th – Broadcast: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's speedy secret talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the Trieste issue have concluded, and the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is on a brighter path. According to sources close to Byrnes, "Byrnes is extremely satisfied with the results of his talks with Molotov in recent days, and believes that the current hopes for the success of the Foreign Ministers Conference are stronger than they were eleven days ago." On the other hand, to prevent any disturbances in Trieste, the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet has made all preparations, and British and American troops are being moved frequently in the Trieste area.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The U.S. Navy Department announced last night that the U.S. 10,000-ton cruiser "Vicksburg" is currently en route from Malta to Trieste. A Navy Department spokesman did not disclose the reason for this move, but it is widely believed that the U.S. warship is heading there to strengthen the forces of British and American warships in the Gulf of Venice. It is reported that this area is currently being contested by Italy and Yugoslavia. According to news from Trieste this morning, there are currently more than ten British and American warships docked in the Gulf of Venice.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 26th] The only achievement of the formal meeting of the four foreign ministers today was the passage of a clause stipulating that the people of the United Nations can claim compensation from Italy, which can be paid from Italian assets.</p>
<h3>Italian Government Authorities Issue Declaration: Determined to Safeguard Sovereignty; Saragat Elected Chairman of the Constitutional Assembly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 25th] The newly elected Italian Constitutional Assembly held its first meeting today and elected a chairman. Orlando, the only surviving member of the "Big Four" at the Versailles Peace Conference, served as chairman. About 500 members attended. As a result of the vote, former Italian Ambassador to France Saragat of the right-wing Socialist Party was elected with 401 votes against 67 votes. Mr. Saragat is 48 years old and served as a minister without portfolio in the first provisional government, opposing cooperation with the Communist Party. The most noteworthy aspect of today's meeting was the unanimous demand to retain the disputed area of Venezia Giulia. Chairman Orlando declared that no material force or immoral transaction could separate Trieste and other towns in the area from Italy. According to Orlando, the threat to the survival of the nation today is more terrible than at any time in history. The treatment of Italy proposed by the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference is an insult to the tens of thousands of brave soldiers who died in battle, making them slaves to foreigners who still regard us as enemies. If this is the case, a dark shadow will be left on the honor of those who called upon us to fight, lasting for centuries. Prime Minister Gasperi then announced that he had stated at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris that the Italian people could not tolerate this kind of dismemberment. If the peace treaty conditions are too harsh, the United Nations will risk extinguishing the light that the world urgently needs and returning it to darkness.</p>

<h3>Amidst Atomic Bomb Testing, Unmanned Aircraft Show Their Might</h3>
<p>4,000-Pound Mysterious Bomb Appears</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, from a sightseeing ship near the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb test site, 25th] The Bikini Atoll will be bombed by an atomic bomb on or after July 1st. Around the atoll, there are four observation posts built with steel towers, equipped with calorimeters, loudspeakers, radio measuring devices, and cameras that can take 3,000 pictures per second. Unmanned aircraft will ascend into the air when the atomic bomb explodes, controlled by radio from aircraft with pilots five miles away. Human observers will be no closer than ten miles from the explosion site and will wear lead jackets for protection.</p>
<p>[United Press, from the atomic bomb test viewing ship USS Appalachee, 25th] A newly created 4,000-pound mysterious bomb that was not used on the battlefield will be exposed to the Bikini atomic bomb explosion on July 7th to determine whether atomic heat and explosive force can detonate it.

<h3>Conference on the Use of Atomic Energy Opens in the United States</h3>
<p>Economic Power Source, Especially Needed by the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[United Press, Estes Park, Colorado, USA, 25th] The international conference on the management and utilization of atomic energy opened here today. Professor Ryder of the University of Chicago, an expert in international public law, stated that the solution to the international management of atomic energy is more important to the Soviet Union than to the United States, because the Soviet Union has a vast territory but lacks cheap coal. Although the economic use of nuclear energy for power is not yet certain, it is already known that it is more widely used than coal. Areas such as Siberia, where there is no cheap coal supply, may soon prove it to be an extremely valuable source of power. Ryder advocated that atomic energy should be managed by an international committee of the United Nations organization, the nature of this committee being like an international court.</p>
<h3>UN Atomic Energy Commission Establishes Twelve-Member Working Group to Draft International Atomic Energy Plan</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 25th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission today unanimously agreed to establish a twelve-member working group to study all proposals regarding atomic energy control, and then report to the Commission. The working group is scheduled to meet this Friday.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 25th] Polish representative Lange announced tonight at the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission his support for the Soviet proposal to ban atomic bombs. According to Lange, the Polish government fully supports the proposal made last week by Soviet representative Gromyko, which stipulates the signing of a treaty to immediately prohibit the manufacture, storage, or use of atomic bombs, and to immediately destroy such weapons anywhere in the world. Earlier, French representative Berloty announced that the French government, in principle, supports the U.S. proposal for atomic control and the prohibition of atomic bombs.</p>
<p>Before the Control Plan is Established, the United States Will Never Give Up Secrets</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] The Soviet Union's desire to have its way on the atomic issue threatens to stall United Nations atomic energy control, and the U.S. Congress is also shaken by this. Some members solemnly declared that the United States will never give up its atomic bomb secrets until an international control method is established. The Soviet plan does not guarantee a layer of international control. The Soviet Communist Party-run Pravda accused the U.S. atomic bomb international control plan as a disguised attempt to seize world hegemony, which has aroused strong rebuttals from the Senate Atomic Energy Committee. Democratic Senator Russell said that the Soviet Union should stop judging others by their own standards. The U.S. plan is generous and willing to give up the inventions obtained with our talents and money. All we ask is to protect the world and ourselves, so that it will not be used for various destructions. I firmly oppose revealing a single piece of information before a control plan is established, and I dare to believe that the majority of members of Congress share this view.</p>

<h3>British and American Scientists Initiate Uniform System of Measurement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cambridge, 25th] Scientists from the United Kingdom and the United States will hold talks soon to seek a uniform system of weights and measures. It is generally hoped that the French system will be adopted. However, because the differences in the current weights and measures systems are too great, it is advocated that a new agreement should be formulated separately. This issue was discussed at the recent Imperial Science Conference. Some people at the meeting also suggested that Britain should cooperate with the United States to establish a standard radio frequency system to meet the needs of the Empire.</p>

<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 25th] The Indian National Congress took emergency steps today to nominate candidates for the Indian Constitutional Assembly. After the British proposal to form a provisional government of fourteen people was rejected, a question has arisen as to what kind of government India will form during the existence of the Constitutional Assembly. Some people expect that the original proposal to form a provisional government will be completely abandoned and discussed separately. Officials may make a formal statement on this within a few weeks. The British had previously declared that regardless of whether India's two major parties individually or jointly refuse to participate in the provisional government, the British will still proceed to form a provisional government that can "fully represent all aspects." At the same time, it is learned that the National Congress has notified the Prime Ministers of the eight provinces to nominate candidates for the Constitutional Assembly. The candidates will be selected from the provincial assemblies in proportion to the number of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs.</p>
<p>Easing the Situation: Three Paths to Follow</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 25th] The Viceroy met with Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, today to inquire whether the League could consider making concessions to the National Congress's demands at this time when both sides have agreed to long-term recommendations. If the League accepts the provisional plan and makes no further concessions, the three paths that the British Cabinet delegation and the Viceroy can choose are: (1) to organize a temporary administrative council, (2) to reopen negotiations on temporary issues, or (3) to postpone the organization of the administrative council during the election of the Constitutional Assembly.</p>

But Gandhi also said that his mind had been very confused for the past four or five days, and he only saw darkness, and he did not know where this fear came from. Therefore, he informed the Executive Committee of the National Congress of this situation and asked them to make their own decisions without considering his opinion. He hoped that the people would follow the decisions of the Executive Committee. He would inform the public when he could see the light again. But during the period when he was surrounded by darkness, he hoped that others would not fall into the same situation as him.</p>

<p>[United Press, Seattle, 25th] The Wages and Hours Committee of the World Maritime Conference today adopted an international minimum wage amendment, which in principle recognizes that the work efficiency of Chinese and Indian seamen is not as good as that of other seamen, so their wages should be reduced proportionally. The American representative insisted on "equal work, equal pay," but most representatives, led by British employer representative Snead, replied that giving Chinese and Indian seamen full minimum wages would be unequal work and unequal pay, unless the work efficiency of the seamen of those countries was equal to that of other seamen.</p>

<h3>If the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union Can Cooperate, the Whole World Will Benefit</h3>

Regarding the issue of atomic energy, if an international understanding can be established, many problems can be solved. If the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can finally have a sincere understanding and cooperate with each other, it will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the world. It seems extremely difficult for some countries that have never suffered from aggressors in modern times to fully understand the emotions of victimized countries and their determination to prevent Germany from aggressing again, but we must make them thoroughly understand this situation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Madrid, 26th] Hoffman, a professor of modern history at Fordham University in the United States, stated in a speech at the University of Salamanca that mutual respect and the maintenance of friendly political relations between the United States and the Soviet Union are important cornerstones for maintaining international peace.</p>

Defense attorney Klessmann asked: Did the Privy Council have no control over the military's actions in "Manchuria" either? (A) None. The cabinet could inform the military of the cabinet's attitude through the Minister of War, but the Privy Council did not even have this function. (Q) Is it true, as stated in the indictment, that after November 13, 1931, the Japanese government approved the implementation of aggression in "Manchuria" to expand its territory? (A) After resigning as Foreign Minister, I only knew what was reported in the newspapers. Next, prosecutor Helen questioned: After receiving reports of the Kwantung Army gathering troops and weapons in "Manchuria," what measures did you take? (A) Because the situation was serious, I strongly urged War Minister Minami to take appropriate measures. He also expressed opposition and agreed with my opinion.</p>
<p>Military Rampage (Q) What measures were taken as a result of the conversation with General Minami? (A) As a result, no effect was had on controlling the military. (Q) Did the Northeast Incident occur after the conversation with General Minami? (A) Yes. (Briefly) Which member of the cabinet should be responsible for this military action? (A) I believe the Minister of War should be responsible. On the day the September 18th Incident occurred, the cabinet was unaware of it. At the cabinet meeting that day, the Minister of War promised to investigate and reply. (Q) From whom did the cabinet receive reports regarding the military's actions? (A) The Minister of War. (Q) From whom did the cabinet receive reports when the September 18th Incident occurred? (A) We received a written report from the Minister of War about two days later. (Q) What policy did the cabinet adopt when the incident occurred?</p>
<p>Cabinet Policy (A) We decided on a policy of preventing the recurrence of incidents and not expanding the incident. Based on this, we sent a statement to the League of Nations. (Q) Who participated in deciding on this policy? (A) The entire cabinet. (Q) Based on the cabinet's policy, what actions did the Minister of War take? (A) I believe the Minister of War gave appropriate instructions to not expand the policy. (Q) Did the cabinet order the Minister of War to implement any policies? (A) The cabinet cannot instruct the Minister of War. (Q) Was the cabinet's policy implemented? (A) The incident could not be prevented. I believe General Minami did his best, but the expansion of the incident is a fact. (Q) Who was the commander of the Kwantung Army at that time? (A) I knew from the newspapers that it was General Honjō, but I don't know if General Honjō actually had real power. (Laughter in the courtroom). (Q) Was General Honjō summoned because of the incident? (A) No. (Q) Were any of General Honjō's subordinates disciplined? (A) I don't know. (Q) Who was the ambassador to China at that time? (A) It seems to be Shigemitsu. (Q) Was the Northeast Incident resolved between China and Japan?</p>
<p>Attempted Resolution (A) It was not resolved. Efforts were made between Shigemitsu and T.V. Soong, but they were halted due to disagreements within the Chinese government. (Q) To what extent did the military's actions go? (A) Initially, only along the railway line area, then it expanded to Jilin. By the end of the Wakatsuki cabinet, it had extended to Jinzhou. Next, defense attorney Kiyose cross-examined: If it was neither the cabinet nor the Minister of War who controlled the military, was it the Chief of the General Staff? Regarding major issues, I know that the Chief of the General Staff and the Minister of War consulted, but regarding "using troops in combat," is it not legally under the command of the Chief of the General Staff? (A) As far as I know, regarding the use of troops in combat, the Chief of the General Staff executes it after imperial sanction (approval of the Japanese Emperor), but in fact, he consults with the Minister of War beforehand. (Q) Do you admit that the actions of the army are legally the responsibility of the Chief of the General Staff? (A) I don't know if it is solely the responsibility of the Chief of the General Staff. Because of the consultation, the Minister of War should also share responsibility. At this point, the questioning of Shidehara came to an end.</p>
<p>March Riot Incident</p>
<p>[Régime Reform Society, Tokyo, 26th] After questioning Shidehara, the International Tribunal today proceeded to examine the famous March Plot Riot Incident, the truth of which had never been revealed, and summoned witness Kiyomizu Yukinosuke to testify. Kiyomizu had long been involved with various nationalist groups. In 1919, he returned to Japan from China with Kita Ikki, Iwata Fumi, and others, and joined the Taika-kai. In 1924, he organized the Daikōsha, engaging in Japanese nativist movements. Prosecutor Helen first read out Kiyomizu's confession: "(1) In 1919, I returned to Japan with Kita Ikki and introduced Kita Ikki to Ōkawa Shūmei. (2) Until March 1931, Ōkawa often met with army officers such as Hashimoto Kingorō at the Kinryūtei tavern. According to Ōkawa, these officers aimed to reform the Japanese government and attempted a revolution. I donated 2,000 yen to Ōkawa for this purpose. My task was to throw bombs outside the Diet building when Ōkawa and others held demonstrations. Ōkawa had planned to lead soldiers into the Diet to occupy the government.</p>
<p>Three Hundred Bombs According to Ōkawa, Hashimoto obtained about 300 bombs from the army, which I then stored. (3) Later, Ōkawa said that this plan failed because the army personnel involved in the conspiracy withdrew. Ōkawa also revealed that General Ugaki had participated in the plan. When Ōkawa informed Koiso, the director of the Military Affairs Bureau, that the plan had failed, Koiso replied, "The abandonment of this plan is based on direct orders from the army." Later, at the request of Marquis Tokugawa Yoshichika, the bombs were returned to Colonel Nemoto Hiroshi of the General Staff Headquarters. (4) On a certain day in August 1931, Ōkawa said, "I will initiate some kind of incident in Shenyang with Colonel Kawamoto Daisaku, Military Police Captain Amakasu, and Kwantung Army Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel Itagaki." (5) After being released from prison in December 1932, I met with Ōkawa several times. Ōkawa was extremely busy organizing the Jinmu Party. The party was an extreme nationalist group that aimed to expel white people from Asia and reform the Japanese government. Around March 1932, Ōkawa said, "I am jointly participating in some kind of conspiracy with young naval officers and Kikkawa Kōzaburō, who hold dissatisfaction with the Japanese government." I said that I would not be able to participate in the plan in the future." After reading this, defense attorney Rix cross-examined: What was the relationship between Koiso and Nemoto? To whom were the bombs returned? (A) At the request of Marquis Tokugawa, I asked Koiso for instructions on how to return them. As a result, the bombs were returned to Lieutenant Colonel Nemoto, who was then the head of the press section. (Q) After the March Incident, were there any other similar plans? (A) I don't remember whether it was the following year or the year after that, but Ōkawa again spoke to me about naval officers and the Ibaraki farmers' group launching some kind of action and ordered me to participate. I opposed it, considering the failure of the March Incident.</p>
<p>May 15th Incident Later, I learned that Ōkawa had participated in the May 15th Incident. (Q) What is the relationship between this matter and this war? (A) There is no relationship. (Q) What did Ōkawa say to you about the outbreak of the Shenyang Incident? (A) Although he didn't tell me a clear opinion, he said while drunk in a tavern, "Although the March Incident failed, something interesting will happen in Shenyang soon." (Q) Did Ōkawa talk about the content of this "interesting event?" (A) Although he did not say it explicitly, I understood it through common sense. (Q) What do you mean by "I understood it through common sense?" (A) It means I understood it implicitly. Next, Kiyomizu answered the questioning from Hayashi Ichirō, the defense attorney for the defendant Hashimoto Kingorō, stating that the goal of the March Incident was to censure the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties, which were neglecting the happiness of the people due to partisan politics, and had no aggressive nature. (Q) Is there an article in the Jinmu-kai's platform to expel white people from Asia? (A) No. (Q) In your confession, you said that the Jinmu-kai aimed to expel white people from Asia, which is different from your testimony now. Which is true? (A) That was the general idea of society at the time. (Because Kiyomizu did not give a clear answer, answering evasively, the solemn courtroom was filled with uproarious laughter. Although Hayashi Ichirō repeatedly pressed him, Kiyomizu ultimately did not give a clear answer and had to give up.)</p>
<p>Next, witness Tokugawa Yoshichika was examined, and his confession was read out: "I am familiar with Ōkawa and discussed the issue of advocating the Shōwa Restoration with him.</p>
<p>Expelling White People He mentioned Pan-Asianism and the oppression of Asian nations by white people. In 1931, I discussed a plan with Ōkawa to place militarists in positions of power in the government. In mid-February of that year, Army Colonel Kawamoto Daisaku came and said that he was ordered by Koiso, the director of the Military Affairs Bureau, to ask me to meet with Ōkawa and persuade them to abandon the plan to place the government under the military. Ōkawa acted in accordance with the army's wishes. Several months later, Koiso said that Kiyomizu refused to return the 300 bombs used in the March Incident, so I advised Kiyomizu to return them." Next, the defense attorney cross-examined: Was Major General Koiso the planner of this plan at the time? (A) I don't know the details. (Q) Did you know the performance of the bombs at the time? (A) I only learned later that they were fake bombs that could not kill people. (Q) In the confession, there is a phrase "place militarists in positions of power in the government." Did you often use this expression? (A) I never used the word militarist. (Q) What is the meaning of the word militarist? (A) It means using military force. Ōkawa believed at the time that he could not break through the dark politics of the time without using military force.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Economic Crisis Urgent: Foreign Businesses Jointly Send Letters to the Mayor with Suggestions: High Prices and High Wages Need to Be Resolved Urgently</h3>
<p>Representative of British commercial groups in Shanghai, Creswick, representative of Dutch commercial groups, Dolly, representative of Swiss commercial groups, Breretton, representative of Norwegian commercial groups, Hoghough, and representative of French commercial groups, Scoto, recently jointly sent a letter to Mayor Wu Guozhen, along with a attached suggestions, describing the high prices, high wages, and labor disputes caused by labor issues, which have resulted in excessive production costs, declining production, and an urgent economic crisis in the city, with an extremely serious situation. The full text of the suggestions is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Full Text of the Suggestions</p>
<p>(1) We would like to make some suggestions regarding Shanghai's economic problems, especially regarding the high prices, high wages, and disputes caused by labor issues. (2) The cost of living index published by your municipal government has recently increased sharply, reaching 52.02% in May, which is much higher than in previous months. In short, the cost of living index has increased by at least 4,000% compared to 1936. (3) During this period of inflation, exchange rate controls are also being implemented simultaneously. The approved value of US dollar notes has only increased by 593 times compared to the value before 1936. (4) Inflation and exchange rate controls have created an unequal situation in three areas: First, foreigners are encountering problems. We believe that the Chinese are also feeling the consumer losses in both their personal lives and business operations. Second, production costs in the city are too high. Due to competitive prices, it is simply impossible to manufacture products. Third, the excessive manufacturing costs are due to labor and transportation issues, not to mention exports. (5) This situation has been continuing for about six months, and it is a very clear and unchanging deterioration. Therefore, we can assert that if Shanghai's economic situation cannot be improved in the coming weeks, most of the city's enterprises will reduce their business scope or close factories and business premises to maintain the minimum state. This is not what entrepreneurs want to do. (6) As a result, unemployment will greatly increase, and tens of thousands of people will have no work to do and no way to make a living. This crisis cannot be contemplated with equanimity. The mayor has repeatedly explained the dangers of high prices and high wages (making it difficult for most capitalists to pay their employees). If this situation is not improved, the collapse of the economy is imminent. (7) If we do not report these facts to the mayor, we will not only fail ourselves but also fail the municipal government and the labor community. From the standpoint of citizens, we also feel that we should share the responsibility of overcoming difficulties together. To protect the well-being of capitalists, adverse economic conditions should not be allowed to continue to overshadow Shanghai. Presented by: Creswick, representative of British commercial groups; Dolly, representative of Dutch commercial groups; Breretton, representative of Swiss commercial groups; Hoghough, representative of Norwegian commercial groups; Scoto, representative of French commercial groups.</p>

There are more than 1,600 temporary licenses for Chinese medicine practitioners in the city, and the verification procedures are cumbersome. One of the items, the guarantee letter, is difficult to implement. In addition, the Nanjing Examination Yuan has not been restored for long, and the progress is slow.

<h3>Theater Industry Went to the Municipal Government Yesterday to Request a Reduction in Entertainment Tax</h3>

<h3>Conclusion of the Live Burial Case; Sentencing Scheduled for Early Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zheng Zhenghua from Xuzhou, residing in Zhangjia Lane, Meilong Town, once served in the enemy's Gendarmerie. He abused his power and harmed innocent people. On the evening of November 16th last year, the township head, Sun Fuxiang, accused Zheng of being a bandit and incited villagers Yu Fubao and three others to break into Zheng's bedroom. They dragged Zheng to the Luo Wang Temple, brutally beat him, and then buried him alive near the Xianren Temple to vent years of accumulated resentment. Later, his wife, Yu Jumei, filed a complaint with the Garrison Headquarters, and Sun and Yu were detained and sent to the District Court. During the trial yesterday morning, the defendants claimed that Yu Jumei had made false accusations because her extortion attempts had failed. After detailed questioning, the court scheduled the sentencing for July 3rd.</p>
<h3>Over 400 Taxis Operating in the City; Jeepney Taxi Rental Under Consideration by Various Taxi Companies</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A total of 33 registered taxi companies operate in the city, with 407 vehicles. These include: Xiang Sheng (62), Asia (13), Xin Xin (2), China United Industries (20), An Tai (12), Hu Dong (2), Shun Feng (14), China Communications (9), Tong Li (7), Xin Zha (15), Da Lai (19), Hu Nan (15), Gong Da (13), You Ning (6), Hua Li (3), Dong Hua (24), China (19), Shanghai (7), Central Xinglong (31), Hai Da (10), Da Hua (number of vehicles not yet registered), Fei Yun (29), Zhong Shan (9), Yangzi (number of vehicles not yet registered), Kai Li (18), Dong Fang (4), Yi Tai (number of vehicles not yet registered), Hu Jia (20), Ka De (9), Fuzhou (number of vehicles not yet registered), Lu Bao (10), Xin Sheng (5), and Bai Le (number of vehicles not yet registered).</p>
<p>In reality, the total number of taxis in Shanghai is more than this, as some privately owned vehicles operate under the names of the listed companies, but are not included in the registration. All taxi companies are experiencing booming business because taxis are fast and relatively cheap compared to other means of transportation. Shortly after the war ended, the fare was 1,600 yuan per 20 minutes, later increased to 2,400 yuan, yet customers still crowded the doors, often having to wait in line and even arguing. The vehicles are constantly running, with very few opportunities to return to the company for rest. Recently, due to rising prices, the taxi companies planned to increase the fare to 4,000 yuan, but the Social Affairs Bureau only approved an increase to 3,600 yuan, so negotiations are still ongoing. Currently, a driver's daily wage is about 1.7 yuan, based on the workers' cost of living index. The average employee's monthly salary is around 60 yuan, also based on the workers' cost of living index. At present, there are no new cars or materials being imported from abroad, so the replacement and repair of damaged vehicles is becoming a problem. Recently, the Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau proposed to allocate 1,500 Jeepneys to various taxi companies to form a joint venture at a cost of US$1,600 per vehicle. The taxi companies believe that Jeepneys are not suitable for winter and rainy weather and would have to be modified. They are also concerned about business prospects once new cars are imported, and whether they can fulfill the installment payments over two years. These issues are causing concern among those in charge, so the terms and conditions are still under consideration.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to a person in charge of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau who spoke to our reporter, someone has applied to the Bureau to purchase a large number of Jeepneys from the United States, modify them slightly, and then offer them for public rental. However, the U.S. military has issued an order restricting Jeepneys for military use only, so the Public Utilities Bureau has no authority to approve the application and is currently seeking instructions from the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Two Typhoons Brewing; Beijing-Shanghai Area to Be Hit</h3>
<p>The second typhoon of the year dissipated after making landfall in Wenzhou, but there were still strong winds in this city. The reporter visited the person in charge of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory of the Central Meteorological Bureau again yesterday. It was stated that the reason for the continuous strong winds in the city is that after the typhoon passed, a high-pressure system rose from the North Pacific to the north of the Yangtze River, while a low-pressure system south of Jiangxi flowed into the Beijing-Shanghai area. The combination of high and low-pressure systems resulted in strong winds. After the typhoon that formed north of Palau Island disappeared, another strong typhoon is brewing in the eastern part of the island. At the same time, there are signs of a typhoon brewing in the South China Sea, but the direction, wind force, and speed are not yet known and may be determined today. It is predicted that the wind force will be stronger than the previous one, and the Beijing-Shanghai area will likely suffer from the impact. The daily reports of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory are included below:</p>
<p>Tropical air currents cover the entire country. The Pacific Ocean remains stable around Japan, Ryukyu, and Torishima. A tropical depression or possible typhoon is northwest of Palau.</p>
<p>Weather forecast: Hazy in the Yellow Sea, brisk easterly winds, moderate to heavy waves.</p>
<p>Central China: Cloudy, locally overcast, with thunderstorms, moderate variable winds, fog in the morning. Shanghai: Overcast, sometimes cloudy and hot, haze and fog in the morning, gentle southerly winds. East China Sea: Cloudy, brisk easterly to southerly winds, moderate to locally heavy waves.</p>
<p>Temperature on the 26th: Highest 91.1 degrees, lowest 79.2 degrees.</p>
<h3>Many Good News; Don't Sigh About Not Being Able to Get a Ride; Public Utilities Bureau Is Constantly Working Hard; Public Buses Will Greatly Increase</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Four red temporary public buses have been officially added to the existing Route 3 since the 21st of this month. These vehicles were purchased from Xiang Sheng Motor Company. It is also understood that the French Public Bus Company will soon have 20 new public buses available, which can be shipped from France in mid-October. The Public Utilities Bureau will establish fixed parking lots at appropriate locations.</p>
<p>[Another Report] At the end of last week, the Public Bus Planning Committee of the Public Utilities Bureau added four new red buses purchased from the United States to Route 3, which has been convenient for passengers since they started operating. It is reported that the Committee has recently purchased 20 public buses from the Supply Bureau, which are being refitted and will all be completed by the beginning of next month. It has not yet been determined whether to add them to existing routes or open new routes, and a decision will be submitted for a vote at a meeting next Tuesday.

<h3>Anti-Smuggling Work on the River Still Feels Weak</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The reporter met with Wu Kexiao, the director of the Municipal Water Police Branch, yesterday to discuss the recent work and anti-smuggling situation of the branch. According to him, the branch is authorized to have 600 police officers, but in order to improve the quality, they must pass a secondary school level exam and then undergo training. Therefore, there are currently only over 200 qualified police officers working. The branch has three sub-stations and eleven police stations along the Huangpu River. There are currently seven patrol boats, all of which are old and dilapidated, and three of them are damaged and still under repair, which affects the work. Of the remaining four, each sub-station is assigned one, and the branch has only one left. They patrol the river all day, alternating shifts, and work all night. As for anti-smuggling, it is only to assist the customs police. Recently, a large number of untaxed American cigarettes and candies have been seized and handed over to the customs. Wu also said that the environment in Shanghai is complex, with a century of concessions and eight years of enemy rule, coupled with the influence of gang forces, it will not be easy to completely eradicate the evil forces along the river and wharves in one day.</p>
<h3>Pseudo Deputy Minister of Propaganda, Zhang Ke, Defends Himself Like a Lecture; Pseudo President of the Supreme Court, Zhang Tao, Tried, Swaggering, Gold Teeth Gleaming, Rude Tone</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Ke, the former deputy minister of the propaganda department of the puppet regime, is a 43-year-old from Hangzhou. He graduated from Columbia University in his early years, and later studied politics at the University of Berlin. After returning to China, he served as the personal secretary of Chen Youren. After the fall of Hong Kong, he was captured and lived in Shanghai for a long time. Later, at the invitation of Lin Bosheng, he took the position of deputy minister of propaganda for four months and ten days. After resigning, he published the "Dagong" weekly. He was previously mentioned by the High Court, and the trial concluded yesterday afternoon. The defendant spent a long time defending himself against the indictment, with ups and downs in his voice, resembling a loud lecture. His content can be divided into two points: (1) During his tenure as the deputy minister of propaganda, he never published or gave speeches promoting peace or publicizing the puppet regime; (2) In the "Dagong" weekly he published, he tried his best to carry out the tasks he could not carry out during his tenure in the puppet regime, and engaged in criticizing the puppet government and publicizing the war of resistance. He then listed the texts from various issues of "Dagong" as evidence. The court also asked about his experience in joining the puppet regime, to which he replied: "Lin Bosheng came to me and said, Wang Jingwei's illness is beyond salvation. What will happen after his death? I said that the only thing to do is to dissolve the puppet organization and convene a meeting of popular representatives to decide. Then I discussed it with Chen Gongbo and decided to take the position of deputy minister of propaganda to carry out this task. Zeng Qi and Ji Sihao were also present during the discussion, and they also knew about this. It was definitely not me who insulted him." During his speech, his voice became hoarse and he forgot where he was, and was stopped by the judge. After lawyer Hong Shihao provided free legal defense, the court ordered the end of the debate, and the sentencing was scheduled for 2:30 PM on July 2nd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Tao, a 61-year-old from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, is a member of the Kuomintang. Starting from the seventh year of the Republic of China, he worked as a lawyer in Hangzhou and Shanghai for nine years. He also served as a judge in the Beiping Dali Court and as a presiding judge in various levels of courts in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, he suddenly changed his allegiance. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, Wen Zongyao, Liang Hongzhi, and others organized the "Reformed Government" in Shanghai to resist the Central Government. Zhang served as a pseudo "Legislative Committee Member" and "Chairman of the Economic Committee". In March of the 29th year, when Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and others organized the Nanjing puppet National Government and established a rebel regime, he was transferred to the post of the president of the pseudo Supreme Court until the collapse of the enemy puppet regime, when he was arrested and brought to justice. When the High Court opened the trial yesterday morning, Zhang was wearing a gray silk long gown, with a self-woven silk short shirt and trousers underneath, gray socks, and black shoes. He had old-fashioned glasses on his nose and was holding a bamboo fan. He swaggered and leaned on the defendant's fence with both hands. When answering questions, Zhang opened his mouth and revealed two gold teeth, constantly saying disrespectful phrases such as "Yes, oh"? "The court understands, oh"? The fan in his hand also started to dance, but it was taken away by the bailiff, and he lost a tool to help him express himself. According to Zhang, he and Chen Zemin were classmates and graduated during the late Qing Dynasty. Later, he served in the legal field. He joined the Kuomintang in the 13th year of the Republic of China. When party member registration was held in the 17th year, he was discarded because he was a member of the Western Hills faction, so he tore up his party card. Although he later joined the party again, he did not receive a party card. During his tenure as the chairman of the pseudo Economic Committee, the Japanese side requested that the ten major companies such as railways, telecommunications, and water and electricity be operated by Japanese merchants, but they were all rejected, which shows that he never acted against the country. As for the "Supreme Court" matter, he said that it was just judicial work and did not harm the country. He was dismissed from the court at around eleven o'clock, and a retrial was scheduled for a later date.</p>

<h3>Qian Yongming Discusses the Monetary System, Says Monetary Reform Is Not Yet the Time</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The reporter recently visited Qian Yongming, the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Communications, and asked for his opinion on the current economic and financial situation in the country. He said that the turning point of the current domestic economy and finance is still related to the solution of the entire political problem. Because the political problem has not been resolved, national transportation cannot be smooth, and the economic and financial communication in various places is cut off. Tax revenue cannot be restored, so the national finance cannot be balanced, and a deficit budget will appear. As for the talk of reforming the monetary system, Qian believes that it seems impossible at present. Moreover, the monetary reform plan should be able to solve the problem once and for all, and it cannot be done again and again. Therefore, the talk of reform at present is not yet the time. Qian believes that the central bank's foreign exchange and gold policies are appropriate. However, he hopes that the central bank should pay more attention to the internal exchange problem of our country. Qian expressed optimism about the financial prospects of this city. He said that Chairman Chiang has worked hard for the political situation, and Special Envoy Marshall has worked tirelessly to mediate, so he hopes that all parties in the country can be tolerant and united. He also hopes that those who often criticize the authorities' policies should actively participate in cooperation, express their opinions, and not just engage in empty criticism, which is of no practical benefit.</p>
<h3>People's Freedom Protection Association Investigates the Case of Students Being Beaten</h3>
<p>The case of patriotic students being beaten that occurred in this city a few days ago has been given great attention by all sectors of society. After the Shanghai Student Anti-Civil War League appealed to the People's Freedom Protection Association of this city, it has sent personnel to investigate and has submitted opinions to the Municipal Government and the court, advocating that the case be handled strictly.</p>
<h3>53 Organizations Supposedly Sending Representatives to Beijing Is Groundless</h3>
<p>According to reports, Ma Xulun and others held a tea party for reporters in Nanjing on the 25th of this month, claiming that 53 units of Shanghai people's organizations, such as the "Shanghai Third District Textile Industry Industrial Union," had elected representatives to go to Beijing to petition. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired with the Social Affairs Bureau, which is in charge of people's organizations. It was stated that the cotton spinning and cotton weaving industries in Shanghai have always been organized separately, and there is no such organization as the Third District Textile Industry Industrial Union. The original Third District Cotton Spinning Industry Labor Union and the Third District Cotton Weaving Industry Labor Union have also been reorganized into factory labor unions and have submitted their seals for cancellation. The 53 organizations claimed by Gui Yanfang and others have been investigated and found to be organizations that have not been approved according to law, and are obviously stealing public opinion under false pretenses. In addition, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's Ninth General Assembly of Members, the Shanghai Industry's Anti-Civil War League, and the Shanghai Student Federation have all issued declarations denying that Gui Yanfang and others are representatives of all sectors of Shanghai. It can be seen that these self-proclaimed representatives have no real basis, and the so-called "53 organizations" are undoubtedly forged.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Shelters, Refugees Compete to Complain</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The number of refugees fleeing from northern Jiangsu to Shanghai is increasing day by day, and the relief problem is urgent. The reporter visited the shelter set up on the upper floor of the Dongjiaxing Road small vegetable market yesterday. The refugees surrounded and complained. According to them, although the shelter once received relief flour, there was not enough to distribute to everyone. Now they only have a bowl of thin porridge a day. How can they survive on that? Therefore, many refugees go out during the day to earn a living on their own, pulling rickshaws, working as coolies, or even begging to make a living. Although many of them are ordinary farmers, there are also many who were "struggled" into poverty. Now that they have drifted to Shanghai, it is not easy to find hard labor, so they urgently hope that the outside world can provide more relief. The shelter currently houses more than 200 people living together, and the sanitation problem is worrying.</p>

Yesterday morning, Wang was arrested at a certain location and taken to room 232 of the Da Shangmei Hotel for a temporary rest. Unexpectedly, Wang Peilin took advantage of the unpreparedness of others to jump from the building and commit suicide. He fell and injured vital parts and was sent to Renji Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and he died more than two hours later.</p>

After research, it is most suitable to operate on the line from Dongmen Road in Nanshi to Dongchang Road. As for the plan to build the Pujiang Bridge and tunnel, it is difficult to realize temporarily due to the excessive cost.</p>

According to the reporter's investigation: Yuan's defense lawyer, Meng Gang, also submitted a petition to the District Procuratorate yesterday, making the same request.

The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has successively allocated 930 bags of flour to the association, which have been secretly distributed to the families of martyrs and poor members.

After several requests from the association, the Education Ministry's Loan Committee has agreed to subsidize tuition and fees for 50 students in private schools. However, most of the children of comrades who suffered still face the crisis of dropping out of school.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Liu Shizhong, a resident of Liuliqiao in Pudong, had been lusting after his cousin Chen Xiubao (25 years old, from the South Pier) for some time because she was quite attractive. He repeatedly harassed her, but was always rejected. At the beginning of March of this year, Shizhong insisted on inviting her to play in Shanghai. Not only did Xiubao refuse, but she also slapped Shizhong twice in the face. Shizhong, unable to achieve his goal, held a grudge. On the night of the previous day, while Xiubao was alone at home, Shizhong entered the house and poured a bottle of nitric acid on Xiubao, and her head, face, chest, abdomen, and other parts were immediately torn apart.

<h3>Charity Football Match Grand and Enthusiastic, Qingbai Wins Again Against Xingdong Team</h3>
<p>Result: Qingbai Team Reverses Defeat with a Score of 2-1, Second Auction of Charity Ball Raises 10 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The grand charity football match to raise funds to relieve disaster victims in central Hunan and northern Jiangsu, Xingdong vs. Qingbai again, was held at Yiyuan at 5:30 PM yesterday. As a result, Xingdong lost to Qingbai again with a score of 1-2. Two minutes before halftime, Xingdong scored a penalty kick against Qingbai, taking the lead with a score of 1-0. However, two minutes after the start of the second half, Qingbai also scored a penalty kick, and Cao Qiuting scored again, allowing Qingbai to reverse the defeat with these two goals. The performance of both sides was quite wonderful, which was the first time seen in Xingdong's seven matches in Shanghai. Yesterday, the initiators Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Shizhao, Fan Shaozeng, and Gu Jiatang were all present to preside over the match, and former Mayor Qian Dajun also attended to watch the match. During halftime, the charity ball was auctioned off, and Ms. Wang Yunmei purchased it for 5 million yuan. Ms. Wang then continued to donate the purchased ball for charity auction, and Du Weifan, on behalf of Hengshe, also purchased it for 5 million yuan. Their enthusiasm for disaster relief is admirable. Next, the award ceremony was held, and Zhang Shizhao presented each of the Qingbai and Xingdong team captains with a silver cup. The grand charity match was declared closed.</p>
<p>Orderly</p>
<p>Yesterday, approximately 10,000 spectators came, all for the sake of disaster relief. Military police were dispatched yesterday, and in addition to setting up posts at important intersections, there were also several lines of barbed wire to maintain order. However, disorderly fans lingered around the outside of the stadium until a quarter of an hour before the end, and a portion of the spectators still broke through the fence and entered. Fortunately, the game ended soon after. The lineups of the two teams yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>Qingbai</p>
<p>Huang Shijie</p>
<p>Yan Shixin Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Qu Yongfu Meng Yiliang Gao Baozheng</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting Luo Choufu up Xu Deming down Xu Wenkui Gu Yiche Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Held</p>
<p>The game began with the national anthem. Referee Zhang Le and Du Yuesheng stepped onto the field to hold the opening ceremony, kicking the ball. The two armies came into contact, and Zhang Jinhai intercepted the ball and ordered an attack. Meng Yiliang sat firmly in the central hub, blocking the way. After five minutes, Fei Chunhua went deep alone, and Huo Yaohua was unable to catch up in time. Xiao Fei tried his foot, but unfortunately, it was deviated and missed. Not long after, Luo Weizhao launched an uprising in the middle road, trying a shot from 30 yards, but it went high over the goal. In less than a minute, Meng Yiliang mistakenly fouled Wang on the left foot, and Xu Jingcheng took the free kick from 30 yards. The ball was urgent, but it was still slightly deviated and went wild again. At ten minutes, Baozheng passed to the right corner, and Chunhua advanced along the side. When he got to a good position, he raised his foot and shot hard, but it was embraced by Zhu Zhaoheng. The situation was average, with each side having offensive and defensive plays.</p>
<p>Xingdong</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng</p>
<p>Huo Yaohua Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Luo Wei Xu Jingcheng Feng Kunsheng</p>
<p>Li Shuoyou Li Zhaorong Liu Songsheng Guo Yingqi Zhang Jinhai Feng Jingxiang</p>
<p>Penalty Kick</p>
<p>The atmosphere at the stadium was extremely tense. The melee continued until two minutes before the end of the half, when Zhaorong opened a corner kick. Jinhai knocked on the door, Baozheng headed to save the day, and Meng Yiliang touched the ball with his hand, violating the rules. Zhaorong took the penalty kick, and the ball went into the net from the right corner. 1-0, Xingdong took the lead in the first half.</p>
<p>Donated One Ball</p>
<p>After the charity ball was auctioned and the awards were given, the two formations were rearranged. The Xingdong team faced the challenge with the original lineup, and Qingbai took a short break, with Xu Deming substituting and entering the field. After the start of the game, the Qingbai forwards attacked relentlessly. At two minutes, Qingbai received relief from Yiliang and was about to cross. Jihua fouled, a penalty kick in the penalty area. Xu Wenkui took the penalty kick and broke through the Xingdong net in the upper left corner. 1-1, creating a tie. Two minutes before one penalty kick, and two minutes later, it was also a penalty kick. It can be said that it was a fair distribution of colors and a return of courtesy.</p>
<p>Qiuting Hits Miraculously</p>
<p>Qingbai scored, and the morale was greatly boosted. At nine minutes, Xiao Fei went alone, rushing straight in. A small pass to the left corner, Cao Qiuting arrived in time, and at about ten yards, he broke through the enemy's fortress again. 2-1, Qingbai reversed the defeat and won. After fifteen minutes, Baozheng went to the ground to save the ball and fouled again. Zhaorong took the penalty kick but did not score. At this time, Yaohua withdrew, Shuoyou entered to supplement the left wing, Songsheng moved to the midfielder, Luo Weiquan lived in the center, and Xu Jingcheng retired as the left back. After this adjustment, Xingdong took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack, but it was still in vain. Two minutes before the end, Wu Qixiang was violently hit by Luo Weiquan and left the field with serious injuries. Before long, the time was up. 2-1, Qingbai won against Xingdong again.</p>

A fierce battle is inevitable. Tickets are sold for 2,000 yuan per ticket, starting at 1:30 PM at the Municipal Stadium on Shaanxi South Road. It is hoped that the audience will strictly observe order so that they can fully enjoy a good game. In addition, the organizers have specially invited Mr. Xi Yushu to hold the opening ceremony for the sake of grand occasion. According to the athletes of Hong Kong Island, they have special skills in small football, such as Xu Jingcheng, Zhang Jinhai. Deng Guangsen, Guo Yingqi and others are unparalleled in the small ball field. Today, Xingdong intends to fight the stubborn Western Union with a wheel warfare method. Moreover, it is the first time for the visiting team to perform small ball, and at that time, the excellent skills will surely refresh the fans. Western Union is centered on Tai Ka, with Oliveira as the mainstay, and the forwards are more in line with Robert Stoff and Favanxiao, etc., gathering all the elite of the Soviet Jewish team, and getting the long-unseen Italian general Tai Douka to help, guarding the gate, adding to the icing on the cake. When the two heroes meet, the wonderful performance is naturally in mind. Today's order and the lineup of Xingdong and Western Union are as follows:</p>

<h3>Joe Louis Boxing Match Broadcast by Television</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, New York, 25th] The New York Times published an article on the 23rd describing the television broadcast of the heavyweight boxing match between Joe Louis and O'Malley last week. According to the newspaper, which was the first championship game broadcast by television, the number of people watching and listening to the game on television screens was more than those packed into Yankee Stadium, the venue of the game. In New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, those with television receivers could watch the game in their homes, clubs, or hotels. Some visited the RCA laboratory in Princeton, where no less than 3,000 boxing fans gathered to watch the boxing match. It is remembered that boxing match broadcasts began 25 years ago, when Jack Dempsey and Karpentia held a championship match in Jersey City. Since then, radio has made some progress, and last week's television broadcast was the latest development in this regard.</p>
<h3>Political Issues Also Exist in World Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Nationalities of Two Polish Players Erased</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The political issue of the Polish government in Warsaw criticizing Polish military personnel who are unwilling to return to their country has even affected the Wimbledon tennis tournament. The nationalities of Polish players Spichala and Teitzinski, who were originally subordinates of General Anders who refused to return to their country, have been erased by the tournament authorities after protests from the Warsaw government. Spichala said: The five of us are now listed as stateless persons, but all we want is to play tennis.</p>

<h3>First Review Completed: Import Application Instructions</h3>
<p>Next Application Has a Fixed Period; Do Not Order in Advance Before Approval</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] It is reported that since the Import Goods Management Office began handling the import license applications for five categories of goods, namely automobiles, tobacco leaves, sugar, films, and kerosene, it has been stipulated that they be processed in batches every quarter (three months). However, the import license applications for the period from March 1st to September 30th of this year will be processed in one batch. The application matters for this period ended at the end of last month. After assessment by several experts at the office, the import quotas for the above five categories of goods within this period have been fully determined yesterday and have been separately notified to the applying importers by the office. It is also learned that for items to be imported each quarter thereafter, applications should be submitted to the office before the end of the second month of the previous quarter. The office may reject or reduce the amount requested in the application. Therefore, applicants should not place orders in advance before the approved amount is confirmed. Furthermore, items permitted to be imported each quarter should be imported before the end of the following quarter; otherwise, the original applicant may not be approved for subsequent applications. However, exceptions will be made for special reasons, provided that concrete evidence is presented. This method applies equally to all importers, both Chinese and foreign. (Chang)</p>
<p>Gold Price Without Special Fluctuations, Hong Kong Dollars More Popular Than US Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold remained stable. The central government's allocated price was slightly increased to 1.95 million, with 245 bars allocated. People's confidence grew stronger, like rising water. The opening price in the morning already showed a slight increase. After the opening, in view of the currency system reform, a slight hint of change emerged, and buyers were still eager, pushing the price up to 1.965 million before some long positions were sold off. In addition, due to the relationship between the central registration allocation and the allocation price, buyers were slightly more cautious. However, the trading volume was limited, and there was no significant change. At noon, the price slightly decreased to 1.94 million, but in the afternoon, it rallied again to around 1.965 million. As a result, the closing price was 15,000 higher than the previous day. The price of gold ornaments was 10,008, and the price of silver remained unchanged. Interest rates ranged from 13 to 16 cents.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market remained difficult for US dollars to rally. The opening price in the morning was flat. The opening price in the morning was flat. The price briefly rose to 2,680 yuan in the middle of the day, but only temporarily. As the gold price slightly declined, it hovered around 2,650 yuan at noon. The price slightly rose in the afternoon, but the increase was not as strong as gold. As a result, the closing price was only slightly higher by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars remained popular, rising from 515 yuan to over 530 yuan. As a result, the closing price rose by another 12 yuan compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose from 520 yuan to around 535 yuan. Indian exchange rates also rose to around 650. The British exchange rate was between 8,500 and 8,000 yuan. Trading was still more active in Hong Kong dollars, while US dollars were ostensibly stable but secretly sluggish.</p>
<h3>Public Bond Transactions Sparse</h3>
<p>Public bond transactions remained sparse, with long and short positions fighting each other, creating a seesaw situation. In fact, the quoted prices were far from reality. Short sellers did not want to linger too long and hastily covered their positions to take profits. Although there were various naive and superficial so-called resolutions, the organization was loose, and knowledgeable professionals did not take it seriously, so most remained on the sidelines. Currently, most over-the-counter transactions are small-scale. The highest price for Type C bonds was 850 yuan, the lowest was 770 yuan, and the final price hovered around the previous day's price. Miscellaneous brands continued to be quoted higher. As a result, Type C bonds were flat and weak, while miscellaneous brands were more stable.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market became more stable. The Hua Nan gang (Southern China traders) reappeared, and Double Horse yarn rose again to 1.55 million. The market closed with strong sales of 60,000 pieces, while the prices of other 20-count small and medium-sized yarns were mediocre, with few transactions. At noon, the Textile Construction Company opened its yarn sales as usual. Blue Phoenix yarn was offered for sale in the 20-count category, with a price 30,000 yuan higher than the Feng Nian brand in the previous period. The quoted prices for other counts and thicknesses of yarn were similar to the previous period.</p>
<p>The momentum of serge and grey cloth remained strong. This was because customer sales were still maintaining, so confidence was good. Serge rose by 1,000 yuan due to a shortage of spot goods on the market. Fine cloth was also in demand from dyeing factories and customer groups, so it also rose by 500 yuan. There were no other significant changes.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was strong due to the continued shortage of spot goods. The association's price list showed that spot medium white sugar was initially 110,000 to 111,000 yuan, then 108,000 to 110,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan. Road cargo was 108,000 to 8,500 yuan, then still 8,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts were relatively firm, 112,000 to 1,000 yuan, then 110,000 to 109,000 yuan. The closing price was 110,000 yuan. The white sugar for the fourth and a half truckloads was marked at 168,000 yuan. In addition, a batch of enemy property sugar was auctioned for the 32nd time, totaling 120 to 136 bags of 180 dan and 750 packages, all at 86,000 yuan. Medium sugar was 937 packages, at 98,000 yuan. Rock sugar was 347 packages, at 162,500 yuan. White sugar for three and a half truckloads was 104 packages, at 168,000 yuan, and another 25 packages, at 145,000 yuan. Unrefined sugar was 55 packages, at 82,000 yuan. It was verified that the amount of medium white sugar requested by the commercial firms from the Taiwan Company the day before was more than 30,000 packages, and it was decided yesterday to supply the full amount, of which spot goods accounted for 25 percent and road cargo accounted for 75 percent. Raw sugar was also quoted at 86,000 yuan. Numbered goods were quoted with 30 packages of green sugar, at 95,000 yuan, 60 baskets of Number 3 ice, at 122,000 to 5,000 yuan, dozens of baskets of Xinghua red sugar, at 100,500, and Xinghua white sugar, at 126,000 yuan, followed by 120,000 to 118,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Increased Grain Arrivals, Market Trends Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the number of grain cargo registrations in the rice market increased to a total of 2,506 shi (unit of volume), an increase of 1,242 shi compared to the previous market day, including 20 shi of "埠尖" (high-quality rice), 114 shi of "蕪秈" (Wuhu indica rice), 2,372 shi of milled indica rice, and 452 shi of rice transported and sold by rice shops themselves. Therefore, the general trend remained as stable as usual. (Yesterday's reports of declining prices for Baiyuan and Yinyuan (silver dollar) rice were erroneous reports from the rice market; the actual market prices did not change.) The situation for flour remained stable, with a slight increase of 200 to 300 yuan. Bran remained temporarily flat. Oil prices were firm in the morning and weakened in the afternoon, with prices hovering around the same levels. High-quality soybeans remained stable, while medium- and low-quality soybeans were sluggish, with prices falling by 500 to 600 yuan. Broad beans were stable, similar to tea beans. Sesame also saw little change. Soybean cakes from Shantou were not popular and sales in the countryside were sluggish, resulting in a stable market situation. Small wheat from Zhoushan, Ningbo, and Shantou was not sought after, leading to a softening market.</p>
<h3>Speculative Ingenuity, Bulls Take Profits at High Levels, Stock Market Rallies Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hua stock market suddenly rallied. Outside speculative funds, seeing the heat, joined in. Long position companies in Yong Yarn took the opportunity to take profits after the rise. Retail investors and new long positions were shaken again. Yesterday, the market retreated, but one or two unpopular small stocks showed their own activity and suddenly shone. Sino-French reached a high price of 217 yuan with trading. High prices were forced down slightly by the general trend, but the underlying momentum remained strong. The highest prices in the morning were Yong Yarn at 560 yuan, Mei Ya at 3,600 yuan, Jing Fu at 255 yuan, Xin Guang at 277 yuan, and Qin Xing at 220 yuan. The lowest prices at noon were Yong Yarn at 518 yuan, Mei Yuan at 3,200 yuan, Jing Fu at 218 yuan, Xin Guang at 230 yuan, and Qin Xing at 170 yuan. Afterwards, the prices leveled off slightly. Unpopular small and medium-sized stocks also stabilized before slightly falling. As a result, the closing prices were half a percentage point lower for Yong Yarn and Mei Ya, and around one percentage point lower for Jing Fu and Xin Guang. Qin Xing was 1.5 percentage points lower. Among unpopular small and medium-sized stocks, except for Xin He, which had to bear half of the subscription shares due to the bonus shares, the decline reached one percentage point. The declines in the rest were very slight.</p>
<p>Some securities firms in the foreign stock industry, in view of the impending customs closure, reduced their holdings and became weaker. Yi Yarn retreated to 9,700 yuan upon opening in the morning, and Mei Lian to 8,400 yuan. After the opening, they continued to decline. After weakening at noon, they recovered slightly. As a result, Ying Lian, Yi Yarn, Paper Industry, and Asia each fell by about 10%. Yi and Wheelock Steel fell by about half a percentage point, while Ye Guang fell slightly but still little.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Industry Stagnant, Timber Stockpiles High</h3>
<p>Taiwanese Tiles Also Arrive. Since the victory, widespread construction has not shown any development. For eight years, timber that has been stockpiled in the mountains for a long time has been hoped to meet the needs of construction after the victory. Unexpectedly, the opposite has happened today. Although the timber has been transported to the cities, there is no way to sell it, and the price of the goods is falling daily. It is heard that in Hangzhou, the timber merchants waiting for sales in this industry almost have living expenses that exceed the value of the timber. Recently, more and more timber has been transported to Hangzhou, while transporting and selling it in Shanghai is mostly loss-making. Among the timber stockpiled in Hangzhou, local wood accounts for 40%, and Hui wood and western Zhejiang wood account for 50-60%.</p>
<p>Most of the people who have been dealing with Min wood round logs and other timber recently are not people in the industry and still hold the wartime single-gang business methods. Therefore, there is quite a lot of the above timber in Shanghai. In Shanghai, square timber is the most important, and foreign timber is the main source of square timber. Round logs are mainly sold in the countryside of northern Jiangsu during the winter every year as a need for building houses, and sales are very small at other times.</p>
<p>[Another Report] A batch of Taiwanese tiles was previously transported from Shanghai by Shanghai merchants and sold very well. It is heard that another batch will be able to be installed in Shanghai for sale in early next month.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Silk Factories Have Started Work, Sichuan Silk Cannot Be Exported</h3>
<p>The water in Zhejiang is relatively stable, so all silk factories have now started silk production, and dozens of dan of raw silk have been transported to Shanghai. The water in Jiangsu is relatively far away, resulting in few who are starting work. The China Sericulture Company requires export silk to meet standards, so it has notified all silk factories that have taken out loans last week to hand over the raw silk they have produced to the company for collection.</p>
<p>Also, the actual amount of the spring silkworm loan is 1,688,477 yuan, which has been recorded in previous reports. According to the person in charge of the business office of the China Sericulture Company, the amount of the loan that the Hefeng Xieji Silk Factory in the spring silkworm loan approved factories has loaned is 40.95 million yuan. Therefore, the actual amount of goods released is 1,694. New silk produced in Sichuan has recently entered the market in large quantities, but due to transportation difficulties, exports have been hindered, and the market price has been declining day by day, from 2,250,000 yuan per dan to 2,000,000 yuan, with no one accepting it. Silk merchants are currently trying to transport it to Shanghai for sale.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk Auction To Have Different Rules</p>
<p>Recently, the amount of enemy property artificial silk transported to this city by the China Trust Production Committee has been quite considerable. It is heard that the China Trust Bureau is slightly modifying the auction method in order to prevent a few people from manipulating it and to enable both large and small factories to bid. Once the method is revised, the artificial silk will be auctioned.</p>
<h3>Banking Law Should Be Revised Again, The Way Out for the Financial Industry Lies in Stability of the Situation, Li Fucun Delivers Important Speech</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the economic center of the country. Since the victory, speculative capital has been rampant and has become a speculative market. The use of deposits by the financial industry has become a major problem. According to Li Fucun, chairman of the Banking Association, since the enemy surrendered, the political situation has been unstable, transportation has been blocked, and prices have soared. Under these circumstances, the financial industry has naturally failed to fulfill its responsibility to support industry and commerce, and most of its businesses have not been reasonable. Li emphasized the way out for the financial industry, saying that the financial industry will have a way out only when the situation is stable. Because with a stable political situation, restored transportation, smooth flow of goods, and prosperous industry and commerce, the financial industry's business can naturally exert its proper function. Li continued, Currently, most banks invest in the commercial sector, in addition to handling remittances. Very few loans are made to factories, and a portion is transferred to loans for silkworms, cotton, etc. Some even take risks to engage in speculation. Regarding the issue of stabilizing surplus financing, Li said, I always abide by the central policy and follow the methods stipulated by the Central Bank. Li believes that the Central Bank's measures are very appropriate. Regarding the general proposal to adjust interest rates, Li said in an objective tone that this matter is not simple and should be studied more from the facts. The reporter also inquired about his opinion on the revised Banking Law. Li said that there is still a need for revision, and said: I am currently discussing with the Legislative Yuan the points that should be revised, because the situation in our country is special, the bank regulatory laws should follow the British broad approach, and should not adopt the American tight policy. The issues of real estate mortgages should all be re-studied and revised, and a concrete decision can be made recently, at which time new banking regulations will be promulgated.</p>
<h3>Tallow Oil Price Increase Not Diminished</h3>
<p>In the past, summer was a slow season for tallow oil sales. Since the rise of soap factories, it has turned into a lively season. At the beginning of this month, the use of soap has greatly increased, and sales have suddenly become strong. The market has risen sharply. Although it seems stable now, the remaining heat has not subsided, and there is still the possibility of continued increases. Moreover, the passenger and freight of this city have been completed, but the industry's hands are not weak, and they are all waiting for prices to estimate. However, Hangzhou, Lanxi, Hankou and other places have reported price increases, so the price increase will not be diminished for a while. Each industry's selling prices increase with the market, with Heben tallow oil at 85,000 yuan, Neiping oil at 80,000 yuan, Du Zhu at 78,000 yuan, Lan Shan at 75,000 yuan, and Macheng oil at 72,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Production Increase Plan</h3>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Increase by About One Half, Yarn Debt in Various Parts of Southeast Asia Rises Sharply</p>
<p>The Textile Construction Company will soon increase production. Cotton yarn is currently produced at 1,000 bales per day, and it plans to increase to 1,500 bales. Cloth is currently produced at 18,000 pieces per day, and it plans to increase to 26,000 pieces, an average increase of about one-half.</p>
<p>Recently, the cotton yarn market has fluctuated slightly, especially the 20-count Double Horse brand produced by Shen Xin Factory, which has become popular and has risen to more than 1.5 million, with a continued upward trend. It is reported that in the past, the cotton yarn market was more stable than other prices. The reason for this fluctuation is due to the stimulation of other prices and the impact of the rise of gold notes. The price of 20-count Double Horse brand in various parts of Southeast Asia is as high as 2 million yuan per bale, so sales are smoother and prices are even higher. It is heard that the cotton yarn sold by the Textile Construction Company recently has been more than 1,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Holders Hoarding, Spot Cotton Transactions Rare</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph continued to rise, soaring 34 to 46 pounds. The near-term price was US$29.98, the long-term price was US$30.17, and the current price of Meiteling was US$30.612. The current cotton market in this port is looking high, because American cotton is becoming more and more expensive, and most holders are hoarding fire, making it difficult for the two parties to reach an agreement, resulting in very few transactions. Only Wuxi Shenxin Third Factory purchased 200 bales of ordinary Meiteling at a factory price of 120,000 yuan. In addition, Hua Hao once made 400 bales of Uruguayan cotton at a warehouse price of US$50.</p>
<h3>Source of Subsidized Flour Becomes a Problem, Currently Will Be Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] In the past, due to soaring rice prices, it was difficult for ordinary people to obtain grain. Wu Ju, director of the Social Affairs Bureau of this city, specially obtained approval from the Shanghai Special Envoy Office of the Ministry of Food to allocate 1,500 bags of flour every day for distribution to rice shops in the suburbs for subsidized sales. The initial price was 200 yuan per catty, and it was later reduced to 150 yuan. Each household was limited to a maximum of six catties per day. Each rice shop was allocated 20 bags per day, up to 30 bags, and all were sold out. Ordinary poor people benefited greatly, but as supply fell short of demand, there were many cases of rushing. The bureau then discussed with the Civil Affairs Department to inform the district offices to first investigate poor households and prepare to distribute them with tickets. This procedure is about to be completed, but the Food Department Office has been ordered to withdraw, and the office has formally informed that it will be temporarily suspended. If it needs to be continued in the future, it will be discussed with the Storage and Transportation Office, but there is news that the Storage and Transportation Office will be set up slowly. It is said that it is currently uncertain whether subsidized flour can continue.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou New Zhenmei Tea, More Than 100 Boxes Traded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Each Basket Quoted at 160,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Zhenmei green tea, which is sold to European and American countries, has been restarted after the victory of the War of Resistance, and tea industry insiders have returned to prepare for production. In particular, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, because of its land relations, has the earliest tea cultivation. This year's new goods have been produced and have been transported to Shanghai a few days ago. Unfortunately, due to the high cost, the foreign limit price is very tight, which has caused many difficulties in exports. So far, no transactions have been made. Recently, tea merchants are still actively seeking ways to expand. Yesterday, more than 100 boxes were traded on the market, which were absorbed by a tea shop in this city for trial sales. The quoted price was 160,000 yuan per dan. At this price, the seller can still earn a small profit, but the export industry may not be optimistic. As for various domestic sales teas, the holders are determined to sell, but the shops and merchants in this street have enough appetite, so there are not many transactions, and the situation continues to be stable. However, Taiwanese black tea and bud tea sell very well in Yixing, Wuxi, and other areas, and the market atmosphere is finally lifted up.</p>
<h3>Seafood Sources Decreased</h3>
<p>The seafood market has all changed, mostly because transportation has been hampered, resulting in reduced sources. Dried scallops, shrimp tails, sea cucumbers, and dried abalones continued to rise. Vermicelli was particularly outstanding. Although the sales of various gangs are clear, the bottom is still firm.</p>
<h3>Nanhua Line Transportation Flourishing</h3>
<p>British Ship Brings Large Amount of Banknotes</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Transportation on the Nanhua Line is flourishing. Yesterday and today, a large batch of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and miscellaneous grains were transported to Xiamen, You Tou, and Guangdong. The China Merchants Bureau's Hai Wan left yesterday afternoon at about 4 pm, heading straight for Shantou, loaded with 30,000 pieces of soybean cakes, more than 1,770 bags of soybeans, 210 bags of sesame seeds, 385 bags of wheat, 19 pieces of fabrics, and more than 320 pieces of cotton yarn. The Taikoo Company's Hubei ship sailed to Hong Kong this morning, also landing at Xiamen. In addition to more than 10 trucks of relief supplies from the Relief Administration being transported to Xiamen, there were more than 300 pieces of passenger and freight fabrics, more than 10,000 pieces of soybean cakes, and more than 1,500 bags of soybeans. Today, the company's Niuzhuang ship will sail to Guangdong with a large amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, about 7,000 pieces. Based on the current water freight, it is about 280 million yuan strong. The total freight of this ship for quick groceries is more than 300 million yuan strong, breaking the unprecedented freight record in the coastal waters of China.</p>
<p>Another report, the Blue Funnel Company's Hardingdun arrived in Shanghai from the UK yesterday. It is heard that 368 boxes of banknotes were transported.</p>
<h3>Siam's Economic Construction</h3>
<p>Using Surplus Rice to Exchange for Materials</p>
<p>[United Press Bangkok, 25th] Due to the widespread famine in Asia, the small country of Siam has jumped to become the country with the brightest economic future in Southeast Asia. Siam is now preparing to accumulate rice worth the equivalent of £18,000,000 of foreign debt next year. The UK is importing 15 million yards of cloth into Siam, which is a material that any Asian country east of India urgently needs. British and American military transport, agricultural, and financial experts are working hard to help the country. The United States is preparing to supply Siam with US$15,000,000 worth of military surplus materials such as trucks. In June, 800 railway carriages and 40 locomotives will arrive in Siam. Military officers in the Pacific region in charge of clearing surplus materials are working hard to supply Siam's needs. On the other hand, Siam is also working hard to increase the planting and production of food with the help of experts.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Production Sharply Reduced</h3>
<p>Before the war, my country's tung oil monopolized the world market. The annual output was 1.36 million metric tons. According to people in the industry, the post-war output is only 20-30% of that. During the war, some tung oil production areas were destroyed by war; even in oil-producing areas that were not affected by the war, most of the tung trees showed signs of withering. The reason for this is that the price of food has risen, and farmers in oil-producing areas have switched to planting miscellaneous grains. It is heard that in the past, one dan of tung oil could be exchanged for four dan of rice. Currently, it can only be exchanged for one dan, so farmers' interest in planting tung trees has decreased, and production has also decreased greatly.</p>
<p>China's tung oil production accounts for more than 95% of the world's total production. Since 1934, China's tung oil exports have surpassed tea and ranked first among exported goods, making a great contribution to the national economy. In 1937, the United States imported more than 174 million pounds of tung oil from China.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Launches Scientific Offensive to Destroy Locust Breeding Grounds</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ji Shaolin</p>
<p>This Newspaper's Tianjin Airmail Report, 23rd</p>
<p>Near Tianjin are two rice-producing areas, one is Xiaozhan, and the other is Junliangcheng. The former was developed by Li Hongzhang's Huai Army, and the latter was used by the Japanese during our War of Resistance, who spent several years trying to build it into a fully scientific and mechanized base for a large agricultural farm of 500,000 mu. I would like to report on the situation of this large farm later. Here, what the reporter describes is a recent disaster encountered in the Junliangcheng area - a locust plague. This locust plague spread over an area 40 li wide from east to west and 10 li deep from north to south. After it was discovered, the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute mobilized 27 technicians and obtained assistance from the Tianjin United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Office, the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Branch, and the US Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin. After more than a hundred days of struggle, the locust plague was finally extinguished. Using scientific methods to control locusts was a first in this area.</p>
<h3>Locust Plague Originated in Junliangcheng, Two-Pronged Attack</h3>
<p>The locust plague occurred in early June. According to a post-event investigation, this group of small animals originated in the Qilihai Lake marsh grassland area 30 li north of Junliangcheng. Initially, they launched a two-pronged attack south, crossing dozens of li of wasteland and reaching the area near the old Jintang Highway. One route窜 (fled) towards Zhang Guizhuang, 20 li west of Junliangcheng, while the main force殺奔 (rushed towards) Junliangcheng. At this time, they split into four routes and launched a frontal assault on the Junliangcheng area, with each route ranging from 7 li wide to 3-4 li wide. Where the locust swarm went, the ground was almost completely covered by these small animals, and crops were雯時 (immediately) eaten clean.</p>
<p>The reporter went to the disaster area for inspection on the 22nd. A corn stalk left the deepest impression on me. The leaves of this corn stalk, which was more than three feet tall, had been completely eaten, leaving only a bald trunk, like a wooden stick inserted in the ground. As far as the disaster situation is concerned, it is fortunate that it was not very serious, because most of the wheat had matured, and the farmers rushed to harvest it after discovering the locusts, and just when the locust was encroaching on the rice seedlings in the irrigated area, it was extinguished. The autumn harvest crops were more affected, and some wheat was harvested prematurely, reducing the yield by several percent.</p>
<h3>Experts from Beiping Rush to Tianjin to Launch Annihilation War</h3>
<p>The Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of Beiping received a report on the 8th of this month. After an investigation, on the 14th, Liu Tingwei, a pest and disease expert, led 20 agricultural students and 6 teachers to Tianjin to rush to the disaster area, start defense, and launch an annihilation war. The locust can only fly after reaching the fifth instar, and its moving ability can reach 200 li around. The larvae stage is called locust nymphs, and the jumping ability can advance one li per day. The first discovery in the disaster area was a large number of nymphs in the third and fourth instars. In the last few days, there were swarms of flying locusts. According to Mr. Liu Tingwei, locusts have a habit of often acting collectively in large groups. When carrying out annihilation warfare, they often take advantage of this characteristic to control them with medicated baits insecticide treatment, but this time the locust swarm entered between the old Jintang Highway and the Beining Railway. This area is crisscrossed by ditches and overgrown with reeds. The locust swarm began to disperse, which is a disadvantageous terrain for carrying out the annihilation warfare. However, Li Dai Tao Jiang (one thing replaces another), the reeds have suffered the disaster in place of the crops, so it should also be said to be an advantageous area.</p>
<h3>Tianjin US Marine Corps Fire Attack on Locust Nests</h3>
<p>In terms of tactics: This locust control operation employed several different methods simultaneously. The main method was to spread poisoned bait across the farmland and spray insecticide in the thickets. However, in order to kill the flying locusts and prevent further infestations within a two-hundred-mile radius, the Tianjin-based US Marine Corps was mobilized. Using the latest flame-throwing weapons, they launched an offensive against the locust nests. The National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration office handled the negotiations and immediately obtained permission from the US military authorities. Thirty-five US Marines, carrying twelve flamethrowers, went into battle on the 22nd. Because the reporter arrived in the disaster area a little late, they were unable to witness their battle, but could only make a post-battle visit to those battlefields. The flamethrowers were concentrated on several ponds where locusts were clustered, covering a total area of more than ten acres. The burned reeds were scattered haphazardly on the water, and dead locusts floated on the surface, showing no apparent resistance to the flames. According to eyewitnesses, the results were extraordinarily good. Afterwards, I patrolled the fields, where poisoned bait was everywhere, and the corpses of locust nymphs were scattered all over the ground. The arsenic lime mixed with sugar lured them to eat it, resulting in their internal organs being burned to a crisp, and they died there.</p>
<h3>Be Careful of Their Return: Locust Plague Nearing End</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration branch temporarily established a method of exchanging five catties of locust nymphs for one catty of flour to encourage farmers to kill locust nymphs, and has already collected and exchanged ten thousand catties of locust nymphs. This locust plague can also be considered a cruel war. Now that the locusts' main camp has been destroyed and the locusts' main force has been defeated, the main five hundred and eighty acres of rice paddies and two hundred acres of variety testing fields have been preserved, and the locust plague is coming to an end.</p>
<p>The reporter once asked Mr. Liu Tingwei where the breeding grounds of locust nymphs in North China are. He said that they mostly originate in the alluvial delta areas of the Yellow River basin, including the Tianjin area, the Weishan Lake area, the Pi (County) Qiu (County) area, and the Kaifeng area. He is not very optimistic about the outlook for this locust plague. He said: If the root cause is not fundamentally treated in the breeding grounds, they may reappear after the autumn harvest. It is said that flying locusts have a strong sense of homeland. Although the first generation of offspring fly to other places, the third generation will definitely fly back to the place of the first generation. There is also a popular saying in Junliangcheng: "South in spring, north in autumn," saying that they move from north to south in spring and from south to north in autumn. Will they make a comeback? The situation after autumn is worth noting.</p>
<h3>Our 8th Air Transport Group in Tokyo</h3>
<p>— Zhu Minwei</p>
<p>It is early summer, and the American military uniforms at Atsugi Air Base in Japan are the same as those of the American military in Jiangwan, Shanghai, wearing yellow khaki military fatigues. At Atsugi Air Base, as in Shanghai, Kunming, and Chengdu, small jeeps are used to run errands and large jeeps are used to transport supplies. The American standardized clothing, actions, and the tall and sturdy figures of the soldiers, combined with their smooth and efficient way of handling things, have spread American utilitarian culture around the world.</p>
<p>Tokyo City Tour</p>
<p>A jeep was specially driven over to spray the just-landed B24 with DDT, inside and out. Americans love to use their resources to fulfill their regulations, without empty talk or sentimentality. (You can't imagine visiting someone on horseback and then having the host order someone to wash the entire horse after you dismount.) Then they asked:</p>
<p>"Is anyone guarding this B24?"</p>
<p>"No. Our guards are staying at the main field."</p>
<p>"That's good, we'll send an MP to guard it day and night for you."</p>
<p>Vehicles were sent to transport Captain Qian's group to Tokyo. The major's car was a sedan, grass-gray in color, with sofas inside. Officers below the rank of captain used jeeps. The jeeps drove from Atsugi Air Base along a gravel road towards Tokyo, thirty miles northeast. The jeep was driven by a Japanese driver, while the sedan was driven by an American driver. The dust raised on the road was even thicker than in western China, but the road was very flat, without any unevenness. The hills on both sides of the road were all planted with terraced rice paddies, and the green color covered the mountains and fields, without a single piece of wasteland. Passing through the Yokohama city area, seeing the dilapidated city scene bombed by American planes, one was reminded of the fierce fighting in the sky and on the ground here eight months ago. After arriving in downtown Tokyo, the US military drove Captain Qian and others to a Chinese-run hotel. This hotel was formerly the Mitsui &amp; Co. Club. In Tokyo, where land is so expensive, the Mitsui Club's two gardens, covering a total area of eighteen acres, with ponds, rockeries, trees, and small bridges, formed a secluded environment beyond the noise of the city streets.</p>
<p>On the 28th, Chief Zhu Shimin and Division Commander Dai Jian went to the Allied headquarters in Nagoya for a meeting and to inspect the barracks of the Chinese occupation forces in Japan. Qian Zulun and his party were left with free time for independent visits and travel. Everyone was visiting Japan for the first time, and as soldiers of the victorious nation in the occupied territories, everything had to conform to the customs of the occupying forces created by the US military here. Therefore, everyone put on the military uniforms that were not for battle, the dark green broadcloth uniforms tailored during their time studying in the United States, and when going out, they had to ride in sedans or jeeps according to their rank. The first goal, of course, was to tour the streets of Tokyo.</p>
<p>After nine months of occupation, the traces of war in Tokyo city are no longer very visible. Most of the bombed houses in the urban areas have undergone some artificial renovation. Although there are still broken walls and ruins, there are no piles of ashes. As for the roads, no bomb craters can be seen, and they have long been filled with asphalt and smoothed out. The car drove smoothly without bouncing anywhere. The Ginza, the bustling district of Tokyo, Ueno Park, a scenic area, as well as the Meiji Emperor's tomb and Admiral Togo's tomb in the suburbs, were all visited.</p>
<p>A Deep Impression</p>
<p>The performance of the Japanese in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation after the war is currently not too much worse than before the war. This shows that MacArthur's approach is not simply a military solution. In Japan, MacArthur does not allow the existence of military affairs and heavy industry, but in maintaining the survival of the defeated Japanese people, this old general is "trying to let the Japanese work as much as possible and also let the Japanese eat their fill." Now Japan's rice is sold by the government, and people buy a fixed amount of rice at certain times. Of course, this amount is less than needed, but it can prevent the Japanese from starving to death. In addition, MacArthur's headquarters enabled most of the silk mills and yarn mills in Japan that could be put into operation to be put into operation, and found markets for Japanese products in the United States, and even used ships to transport these Japanese goods to exchange for American flour, so as to fill the stomachs of working Japanese with bread.</p>
<p>Because the Japanese have been defeated in the war, they do not pay attention to their appearance and dress casually. Almost all men of military age wear short and tight Japanese military uniforms, with narrow-brimmed caps that cover their eyebrows, just like the appearance of Japanese prisoners of war we see in Beijing, Shanghai, and along the Yangtze River, except that all the symbols indicating rank have been removed. Most women wear Western-style clothes, like the Japanese women commonly seen in the Hongkou area of Shanghai, and some also wear a kind of flight suit-like attire with a shirt attached to pants.</p>
<p>They themselves hold a concept: "After losing the war, everything must be started from scratch, like a craftsman facing a ruined house that has fallen in a storm, knowing that hard years lie ahead, and this starting point is certainly even more bitter"! They are also very quiet, because the house has collapsed, but a layer of fear of destruction has been removed. Just look at their leisure fishing near "Sukiyabashi" (bridge name), and you can see a glimpse.</p>
<p>The Japanese have no dignity to speak of, so they simply abandon face. In Chinese restaurants or other Japanese cafeterias, Qian Zulun and his friends gave the leftover squid to Japanese female diners, and these women gratefully accepted and ate it. Because they were eating a bowl of white rice, and they considered it a luxury to be able to buy an egg to accompany the meal.</p>
<p>Later, they visited Atami Onsen. The thoroughness of Japan's transportation system and the density of the countryside, fields, mountains, forests, and trees left a deep impression on them. If China wants to catch up with this defeated country across the sea, these two things alone will require some unremitting spirit and arduous years. (16th · Shanghai)</p>
<p>The United States has begun selling these mobile homes since June, each priced at US$4,685 for the needs of repatriated civilians to live in (Special dispatch from the New York Times of this newspaper)</p>

<h3>Let Me Talk About National Affairs Too</h3>
<p>Editor: I have witnessed that left-leaning writers in current books, newspapers, and magazines often attribute the blame to the government, which deeply and intensely influences people's minds. Driven by patriotism, I find it difficult to tolerate their confusion of black and white, and I would like to discuss today's national affairs with those people.</p>
<p>Nowadays, when people talk about the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, they often blame the Kuomintang. Many extremists even believe that the Kuomintang has a hundred wrongs and no rights, while the Communist Party has a hundred rights and no wrongs. We, who have a little reason and conscience, can no longer tolerate their distortion of right and wrong, and must also express our opinions:</p>
<p>(1) No More Delay! — Opposition to civil war is the unanimous demand of the whole country. What is the reality? After many people's mediation, several negotiations, and several cease-fire agreements, it always stops and starts again, fights and stops again, talks and fights simultaneously, fights and talks simultaneously. Such negotiations and such ceasefires have been going on for ten months since the victory, and the people of the whole country are still suffering from the pain of war, unable to return home as refugees, unable to stabilize their lives, with economic panic, and the obstruction of rehabilitation. The people are unanimously condemning the government, and the government is also distressed by the fact that the entire fiscal budget cannot be balanced and economic policies are often hindered. The root cause is that the country's transportation cannot be unified, materials cannot circulate, and government orders cannot be widely implemented, right? Therefore, as far as the government is concerned, it must also be very averse to civil war. The current path to peace is for the Communist Party to lay down its weapons and for the government to reorganize. If both parties compromise in this way, the whole country will be peaceful and unified, and both parties can compete for power in a democratic manner. According to the current situation, the Kuomintang may still be the dominant party, and it is not difficult to win back the lost hearts of the people by reforming and seeking self-improvement. The Communist Party, not having the certainty of seizing power, pins its only hope on deteriorating the chaotic situation, dragging it out until the people are destitute. At that time, the people will no longer be able to trust the government and will no longer be able to tolerate the reality, and then the rioters will think that an excellent opportunity has arrived. To seek peace in this way is like climbing a tree to catch a fish! — Therefore, we appeal to everyone that the situation can no longer be delayed and that the national problem must be resolved within the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(2) The Northeast should be received as a whole immediately. Receiving the Northeast is based on the Cairo Agreement, the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the government's consistent policy since the September 18th Incident, and the unanimous demand of the whole country. Therefore, only the government recognized at home and abroad today can receive the sovereignty of the Northeast. It is a matter of course, justified and right. Anyone who attempts to forcibly occupy the Northeast is plotting wrongdoing. After our tireless appeals and the righteous and solemn support of friendly countries, it was not easy for the Soviet army to withdraw from the Northeast and for the normal national army to go to receive it. However, the Communist Party, under the guise of the people, forcibly occupied the Northeast and obstructed the government from exercising its sovereignty. Why should we tolerate this behavior that disregards the overall interests of the country? In the Communist Party's absurd theories, the same as when they borrow the meaning of "democracy" and "freedom," there is the so-called "people's sovereignty" and "people's armed forces." Anyone with a little knowledge knows that they have abused the meaning of sovereignty, and there is no need to explain it here. Just ask where this "people's armed force" comes from? It was not heard of when the enemy and puppets occupied the area; it was not heard of when the Soviet army advanced; it only came out from underground when the national army was receiving it. Isn't it mistaken the target! In addition to demanding that the government immediately receive the entire Northeast, we cannot recognize any new puppet regime's power or armed forces.</p>
<p>(3) Give Marshal Ma the Right of Arbitration. — Who is the fairest, of course, is the people, but there are too many opinions from the people, and it is difficult to hear the opinions of the truly majority of the people. As for Marshal Ma, of course, some people will attack him as an American, but in this chaotic situation, the only ones who can stand outside the realm of right and wrong are the Americans. So why should the United States care about the situation in China? Because in the current world situation, only with peace in China can there be peace in the Far East, and only with a strong China can the world be stable. Moreover, a chaotic China will brew the source of war, and a weak China will be coveted by strong neighbors. Therefore, the Americans care about the interests of China, which is also caring about the interests of the United States itself. The Americans seek their own safety, and indirectly must also make China safe. Because of this, we recognize Marshal Ma as a qualified mediator. "Political democratization, military nationalization," is the proposition of the Chinese people, and it is also the condition for reconciliation put forward by Marshal Ma. Since we agree with Marshal Ma's position and Marshal Ma's proposition, then in order to avoid delays, we must give Marshal Ma the power of arbitration. After the "Political Consultative Conference," the Communist Party, on the pretext that the Second Plenary Session was not in their favor, took advantage of Marshal Ma's return to his country to forcibly occupy Siping in the Northeast and destroy the ceasefire agreement in North China, which led to the current situation. As for whether the government attempted to break the contract, it is only an estimate by the Communist Party, while the Communist Party really broke the contract first! Where does the truth lie? There is a public opinion. Generally speaking, the reason why the Communist Party is still unwilling to accept Marshal Ma's arbitration is also because of this.</p>
<p>(4) Why does the Communist Party want to attack the Allied countries? — The Communist Party says that the United States interferes in China's internal affairs, hinders China's sovereignty, and loudly calls for "American troops to withdraw from China," and so on. These arguments are very easy to make people impulsive, but after careful consideration, isn't this the Communist Party's refusal to accept Marshal Ma's right of arbitration and attack on the US military for transporting troops for the government? The reasons for this are explained as follows: (1) No one can deny that the United States' mediation of our internal war is not interference in our internal affairs. The reasons why we are willing to do so, in addition to what was said in the previous chapter, are only for self-reproach and to engrave it in our hearts! The country has now reached such a point. May I ask, apart from this inferior strategy, is there any other way? (2) As for the United States hindering China's sovereignty, I don't know what it refers to. Apart from our voluntary granting him the right of arbitration, it seems that there has been no situation similar to that of the Soviet Union in the Northeast. It is too disproportionate for the Communist Party to blame this one instead of that one! (3) The work of the US military stationed in China is to handle the affairs of the prisoners of war and assist China in receiving the sovereign rights. I am afraid the latter is more important. Now the Japanese army has already surrendered, but the Northeast is still a problem. To be honest, the United States does not want the Northeast to become the Balkans of East Asia. The US military's stationing in China is currently a stabilizing force. Except for the Communist Party with ulterior motives, no one dislikes the US military's stationing in China at this time. (4) The Communist Party also says that the US military's transportation of troops for the government is enough to expand the civil war. We think that if the government had not recovered Changchun, there would have been no room for negotiation at all. It seems that if the Americans had not transported troops for us, let alone receiving the Northeast, I am afraid we would not have even stepped into North China! What would the situation have been like then? We must admit the fact that it is precisely because of the US military stationed in Qingdao and Dalian that the civil war in North China has not expanded; it is precisely because of the strengthening of the national army in the Northeast that the current negotiating situation has been left. If it is a mistake for the US military to transport troops for the government, then the Communist Party should also think about how the "Northeast Allied Army" was established? Without this instigator, the Kuomintang-Communist problem would not have occurred in the Northeast at all. The Communist Party is so harsh on others and lenient on itself, and the people of the world are not entirely deceivable.</p>
<p>Finally, I appeal to the left-leaning intellectuals to pay attention: you attack the US military for arming the government army, but how can you still force the government to recognize the bandits armed by the Soviet army in the Northeast? You attack the government for not being sincere in the negotiations, but why do you allow the Communist army to be rampant in the Northeast and launch wars in various parts of Shandong? Your one-sided arguments only fuel the arrogance of the Communist Party and are of no help to the country or the people!</p>
<p>What time is this? What world is this? I ask the intellectuals to bring out their conscience, recognize the facts, and stop shouting and cheering for the ambitious! Wei Boqiao, June 20th.</p>
<h3>From Liaoyang to Siping: A Seven-Day Siping Dispatch</h3>
<p>— Guan Rongqin</p>
<p>Seven-Day Siping Dispatch</p>
<p>After a hurried farewell to a few friends, I, the reporter, boarded a carriage and rushed to the train station to catch the 2:00 PM train. I had stayed in Liaoyang for over forty days. Had I known I would stay so long, I would have become restless. But as the time to leave approached, I felt a bit reluctant. To be honest, I didn't like the obstacles and fortifications every five steps or every ten steps in Liaoyang. Yet, I loved many things besides the obstacles and fortifications. Indeed, Liaoyang produced several "famous" traitors, such as Yu Chonghan and Yuan Jinkai. The buildings built with the blood and sweat of our Northeastern compatriots – the Yu family's and Yuan family's – still stand tall in this ancient mountain city, diminishing its charm. Yet, they cannot erase its innate beauty.</p>
<p>Everything is Verdant Green, but Fields Cannot Be Planted</p>
<p>The Tang Pagoda stands healthily towering over the West Station, having withstood countless wind and rain erosion! Century after century, it still appears so "vigorous in old age"! Then, there's the Confucian Temple, also adorned with historical wrinkles: the courtyards surrounding Confucius and the "Seventy-Two Sages," where is there not a lush green carpet of vegetation? Perhaps because it quietly stands in the eastern corner of the city, there are fewer visitors. Stepping through the temple gate, if you weren't wearing squeaky leather shoes, you'd surely hear the buzzing of flies and mosquitoes. Its serenity offers a perfect contrast to the noisy streets filled with clattering carts and flying dust. Moreover, there's the Martial Temple – the Temple of Guan Yu and the Kui Xing Tower – also located in the eastern part of the city. Indeed, they are surrounded by fortifications, barbed wire, electric fences, and the like, symbolizing unease. However, you will not forget that Liaoyang is indeed the earliest built county town in Liaoning Province, even older than Shenyang.</p>
<p>Traveling north from Liaoyang (only reaching Siping Street) is like traveling south from Liaoyang: along the railway line, one sees lush greenery everywhere, swaying in the wind. Recalling the scene from two months ago will give you the feeling of entering another world. To prevent bandits from sabotaging transportation, the authorities issued an order long ago: no crops are allowed to be planted within five li on both sides of the railway. Five jia on each side, totaling ten li. Someone managing the railroad should calculate how much land in the Northeast cannot be cultivated! In a country plagued by famine where people and animals eat each other, the phenomenon of having fields but not being allowed to plant them is absurd, unless you're a fool and don't find it strange!</p>
<p>Several Large Stations, Tracks Like Spiderwebs</p>
<p>From Liaoyang to Siping, one passes through several large stations: namely Sujiatun, Shenyang, Tieling, and Kaiyuan. Sujiatun may not be a large place, but the Sujiatun Railway Station is the first in our country and the third in the world. One can imagine its size. Whether it is that big still needs to be verified. I only know that when arriving at the station, looking out from the train window, one sees dense, parallel tracks that extend endlessly, tiring the eyes and spirit. Shenyang is naturally also a large station, but the number of parallel tracks is not as many as Sujiatun. Tieling is also considered a large station. It's 180 li from Liaoyang to Shenyang, and 120 li from Shenyang to Tieling. It is said that Tieling used to be an industrial area. However, the impression this "former industrial area" county town gives the reporter is only of some empty, large buildings in the suburbs. They look grand from the outside, but looking in through the blackened windows, one would never imagine they were factories. If someone hadn't told me beforehand, I would have suspected those buildings were haunted houses, burned by people afraid of ghosts. The streets within Tieling are still neat, with green trees standing regularly on both sides. Stalls selling Japanese goods occupy two or three main streets, where the crowds are like a sea, always pushing and shoving.</p>
<p>Kaiyuan Divided into Two Cities, Eighteen Li Apart</p>
<p>It is only sixty li from Tieling to Kaiyuan, and the train arrives in one hour. Kaiyuan is divided into two cities, new and old, with a distance of eighteen li between them. The new city is much better than the old city, undoubtedly because the Japanese residential area is in the new city. New Kaiyuan was the foothold for the National Army's previous attacks on Siping, Xifeng, and other places. Although the National Army has advanced far away, it still leaves behind many rear supply stations. Fortresses and barbed wire give these "stations" an air of authority. The streets of New Kaiyuan are neat, but because recovery is difficult, many places are still unresolved. For example, the land registration books here were taken away by the retreating Eighth Route Army, resulting in many unclear property disputes. Often, the county magistrate or the head of the finance department must handle them. The remaining Japanese residents are gradually returning to their country or gathering in one place. The vacated clean houses are either occupied by current railway employees or have their doors and windows nailed shut with wooden boards, on which are pasted labels like "×× Police Officer's Residence" or "×× Team Leader's Residence." The Japanese who have not left continue to sell the items they cannot take with them, and there are many cheap things. However, once they pass through the hands of speculators, the prices are several times higher. Books are still cheap, five yuan a jin, but few people buy them. Some Japanese people don't want the books to fall into the hands of our compatriots, so they burn them. Many students patrol in groups, specifically searching for books about to be thrown into the fire to enrich their school libraries.</p>
<p>The Flames of War Have Subsided, but Landmines Still Explode</p>
<p>The Shenyang-Japanese passenger train resumed service on June 1st. I, the reporter, took a military special train from Kaiyuan to Siping on May 28th.</p>
<p>Like other cities in the Northeast, Siping is divided into two areas: one is the Japanese residential area, and the other is the "Manchu" area. The buildings and sanitation are very different in the two areas. Standing on the high and long "Bridge" and looking around: the west is the Japanese residential area, and the east is the "Manchu" area. The former is called "Dao Xi" (West of the Road), and the latter is called "Dao Dong" (East of the Road). Dao Dong has tall buildings, the streets are neat, wide, and flat, and there are green trees along the streets that are several feet tall. Now it is "chaotic to live in", but the place is still clean. Dao Xi has few tall buildings, and although the streets are still neat, it is not easy to find even stone roads. The ditches are not cleaned, filth is everywhere, there are no trees, and low-class brothels are everywhere. The flames of war have subsided for over half a month, but the landmines buried by the Communist army still "boom" day and night. During the war, it is said that hundreds of innocent civilians died. Walking the streets and suburbs, one often smells the stench of corpses and hears complaints. The train station, burned down to a blackened skeleton, and the suburban buildings, with thousands of holes and wounds, are especially unforgettable for people.</p>
<p>Visiting Key Figures in the Provincial Government, Discussing the Current Situation of Recovery</p>
<p>To understand the current state of recovery, I visited the local authorities: first, I visited Chairman Liu of the provincial government. Unfortunately, he was out on official business, so I had to present my card to request an audience with Mr. Zhang Shilun, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. The busy Director Zhang received the reporter with such leisure, which immediately gave me an unusually deep impression. Director Zhang said: The provincial government moved back to Siping on May 18th and immediately started working. Originally, the provincial government had completed the takeover on January 8th of this year, but after the Soviet army withdrew, the Communist army immediately came to seize it. The security team under the command of the provincial government, regardless of their weak forces and inferior weapons, rose up to resist, fighting from March 12th to March 17th, and finally retreated due to the disparity in strength. In total, 700 people were sacrificed, and nearly 1,000 were injured. Most of the personnel under Chairman Liu of the provincial government were captured. Although this battle was a defeat, it was the first instance in the post-recovery Northeast of the provincial government independently resisting the Communist army with its own forces. Talking about why the Communist army wanted to seize Siping and defend it to the death, Director Zhang said there were three reasons: First, they saw that the Northeast problem would be resolved through political negotiations by the government. To enhance their power at the negotiating table, they had to fight fiercely in Siping, Changchun, and other major places to show their strength; Second, Siping is a key point in the Northeast, a political and military hub of the Northeast. By occupying it, they could cut off the connection of the National Army heading north and coordinate with the Communist army in Changchun and its vicinity; Third, Siping still had materials left over from the enemy and puppet regime, which they wanted to plunder. Speaking of the problem of internal staff in the provincial government, Director Zhang said that those above the recommended grade mostly came from the rear, while those above the commissioned grade were mostly recruited locally: this was not because there was a distinction in the use of personnel, but because local personnel (many of whom were university students) had rarely had relatively important work experience during the puppet Manchukuo era. Speaking of the takeover and security situation of the counties, Director Zhang said: All counties in Liaobei had completed the takeover, except for Tongliao County, where the county government was temporarily located in Liaoning Province due to poor security. The security situation in all counties was not a major issue. Finally, talking about the takeover problem, Director Zhang said that the so-called takeover was just a few half-broken houses, and the materials were scarce.</p>
<p>However, according to Mayor Yang's reply: "We have to do it anyway; even if we do it slowly, it's better than staying still. We have to create the environment"!</p>
<h3>Social Services: Answering Readers</h3>
<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Shen Ruijun asks: I have been suffering from a type of ringworm on my neck for the past few years. The pain is extreme. I have used various ringworm medications on the market, but not only have they not been effective, but they have gradually spread, occupying half of my neck. I sincerely ask if you have any special medicine or can introduce me to a dermatologist. I would be extremely grateful.</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Medicine] There is no special medicine, but X-rays can be used for treatment. You may want to consult Dr. You Pengxi, whose address can be found in the telephone directory.</p>
<p>(2) Fei Cun asks: My sister Chun was born in the sixth month of pregnancy, commonly known as a "June report." She is now seventeen years old but has not developed, still like a thirteen or fourteen-year-old girl. I would like to ask several questions: (1) Is her lack of development due to congenital deficiency? (2) What is the usual age for development? (3) Will it affect her future fertility and the children she may have?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renxu, Doctor of Medicine] (1) It is indeed a congenital deficiency. (2) Whether she will develop in the future depends on the situation. You can consult a pediatrician. (3) If she does not develop fully, it will certainly affect her fertility. (3) Pingpingjun asks: Dear editor: I am a young student. As a child, I accidentally injured my ankle, and soon my leg became red and swollen, with cramps in the joints and excruciating pain. After being diagnosed by Chinese and Western doctors as bone tuberculosis (i.e., what Chinese medicine calls penetrating bone flow), I was told to rest and receive injections and take medicine at the same time, but it was ineffective. Unexpectedly, before long, the leg suddenly ulcerated, and the illness became even more dangerous. Doctors were helpless, and medicine had no effect, and finally, it became a stubborn and incurable chronic bone tuberculosis. Later, during the Anti-Japanese War, the environment was harsh, and I could not continue treatment. During that time, the condition sometimes worsened and sometimes eased. Now I write to ask for medical advice, hoping to cure my chronic illness once and for all.</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Ren, Doctor of Medicine] It is bone tuberculosis and should be treated by a bone specialist. The future depends on the degree of progression of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Searching for a Missing Orphan Girl: I am a maidservant whose husband died early. I have a daughter who is now fourteen years old. Because I lack someone to take care of her, I entrusted someone this month to recommend her to work as a maid in a mansion near Xin Yamen on North Zhejiang Road. Unexpectedly, she suddenly went missing on the 6th of this month. Whether she ran away or was abducted is unknown. The girl's name is Ayou. She is short, with short hair and dressed in casual clothes and running shoes. She is from Taokao Ao, Lianglong, Yuyao, with a Shaoxing accent. I only have this one daughter, and I am extremely grief-stricken. Because I cannot afford to publish an advertisement, I especially ask to borrow a corner of your newspaper to disclose this information. If any kind-hearted person knows of her whereabouts, please notify 38, Lane 504, Tongfu Road, Zhongzheng Middle Road, so that mother and daughter can reunite. I will be eternally grateful.

<h3>Inquiry into the Grain Loan Case</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The grain loan case is still under investigation, and the time has been prolonged for a long time. Although the common people are very anxious and hope that the truth will come out soon, they think that the judicial process must be thoroughly investigated and the evidence must be conclusive before a verdict can be made, so they can still be patient.</p>
<p>However, it would be wrong to think that by dragging things out, a big thing can be turned into a small thing, and a small thing can be turned into nothing. To be honest, if this grain loan case cannot be handled clearly, the subsequent impact is really unknown.</p>
<p>Now, there are many people on the streets and alleys who have gone from whispering to shouting loudly. They say: During the dark and corrupt period of the puppet organization, a major case was handled, which made people very happy. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, under the National Government's consistent policy of eradicating corruption, they believe that things will never be handled vaguely.</p>
<p>What makes people wonder and worry is that two agencies are competing to handle this case. On this, we do not necessarily firmly advocate which agency should handle it, whether it is the court or the Garrison Headquarters. However, there is one principle that we adhere to, and that is that it must be public and must be handled impartially!</p>
<p>Yesterday, the two grain officials, Wang and Ren, were escorted to the Garrison Headquarters. It is said that during the interrogation, the testimonies of some grain merchants and Wang Daren involved the Ministry of Food and Minister Xu Kan. The military law office has sent a letter to the Ministry of Food to investigate the truth, but has not yet received a reply.</p>
<p>We suggest that the Garrison Headquarters immediately summon Xu Kan and relevant personnel from the Ministry of Food. We know that during the gold bribery case in Chongqing last year, the Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun was summoned to the court to testify. Therefore, we believe that Minister Xu will definitely step forward to ensure that the investigation of this case can be completed as soon as possible. Otherwise, what will people think?</p>
<h3>About the Longhua Society</h3>
<p>— Yang Hongnian</p>
<p>Emperor Ma's Departure Is Not True</p>
<p>In a metropolis like Tianjin, it is surprising that the so-called "One Heart Great Dao Longhua Holy Church General Assembly" can still exist as usual after the restoration. This cannot but be said to be due to the leniency of the authorities. The report on the 17th, an 8th-day Tianjin dispatch, although describing it in great detail, focuses more on the situation during the war and after the restoration, with little emphasis on the past. Therefore, I would like to make public what I know to inform readers.</p>
<p>Before the war, Tianjin was a so-called special area, especially the Japanese concession, which fully used the opportunity to create this "special" hub. Japanese rogues and special agents were constantly using these ambitious wolves in various guises to do things that would numb the people. But speaking of the origin of this "Longhua Society," it originated far away on Changshan Island, Shandong. The so-called "Emperor Ma" was a big household on the island. I don't know what kind of person encouraged him, but he actually started to make up dreams in this small village. At first, he did sell his family property to do some good deeds for the public. At the same time, the people of Shandong were complaining about Han Fuju's "Qingxiang" because Han Fuju used the policy of "fighting poison with poison" and used bandits as leaders to suppress bandits. Therefore, there were inevitably some incidents of foxes pretending to be tigers. "Emperor Ma" also took this opportunity to pull in a lot of believers, who had to donate all their family property to the church so that wealth could be evenly distributed. The uniform treatment did indeed gradually increase the number of people who were loyal to him. Slowly, his ambitions developed, from villages to towns, from towns to counties, so that he effortlessly occupied the entire Changshan. At this time, Japanese special agents provided a large amount of military supplies and sent people to assist and command, so "Emperor Ma's" reputation in Shandong was even greater than Han Fuju's. If anyone still remembers Han Fuju's "no closed doors at night" policy in Shandong, he cannot be said to have done nothing to suppress the "local emperor." But the second half of this merit was left to the Japanese. Like using Puyi, the Japanese saw that "Emperor Ma" could not stand in Shandong, and specially sent a transport ship to take him to Dalian, and then to the Japanese concession in Tianjin. Around 1929, the yellow flag of the "One Heart Heavenly Dao Longhua Holy Church" was hung at the corner of Taoshan Street and Suma Street. Another flag was inscribed with "Living from the True Great Spirit Mountain," which was quite confusing. One word in the former flag was written as —, and there was also a flag called "True Lord" and other heretical claims such as changing the monthly calendar. At this time, his followers were mostly over forty years old (there were also a few people over ten years old), wearing blue cloth robes, buttoned on the left, cloth shoes, cloth socks, and braids, all the same. They were rarely heard reciting scriptures, and at dusk, they often stood outside the door, flirting and scolding prostitutes across the street, and there were quite a few of them.</p>
<p>In 1937, when the National Army withdrew south and Tianjin fell, the leader of the society led his followers in a parade through the streets, while he himself sat steadily in a "Buick" sedan. He made similar cries, but it was impossible to tell what language it was, which made people suspect that he was not human. Later, the society occupied the Grand Stage in Nanshi, and also used the opening of porridge kitchens and written donations everywhere. All large shops and gentry were required to donate a certain amount, which was actually using power rather than doing good deeds. The report said that Tao Yunxiang claimed that "Emperor Ma left in 1935," which may not be true or is an intentional cover-up. His boasting about running charitable undertakings to cover up underground workers is all lies. If the society could also cover up underground workers, Japanese special agents might be even more convenient! In short, this is not some heterodox cult, but an organization with a full political function. I hope the authorities will pay attention. At the same time, I hope that the citizens of Tianjin will report everything in the past so that the authorities can better handle it. Therefore, I have recorded what I have heard.</p>
<h3>On "Little Red"</h3>
<p>— Cao Zuohan</p>
<p>There was a textual researcher who specialized in creating indexes who said: "The Little Red in *Dream of the Red Chamber* is an allusion to Hong Chengchou, the Ming Dynasty traitor and Qing Dynasty meritorious dog, that official of two dynasties." I am not a disciple of reckless speculation and dare not comment on this statement. However, such a comparison is a bit unfair to Little Red and also a bit unfair to Hong Chengchou.</p>
<p>"People aspire to climb high, water flows downward," is originally a worldly sentiment. Consider Little Red's situation when she was in the Yi Hong Courtyard. She only did peripheral work, some coarse tasks outside the main house. The matters concerning Master Bao were handled by Xi Ren, Qing Wen, She Yue, Qiu Wen, and others. Furthermore, there were other old women and senior maids who formed a solid circle around the core. She had no chance to enter the inner sanctum to get close to her master, so naturally, she could not gain the master's trust and love. If servants cannot gain the master's trust and love, how can they become popular among the other servants and outshine them? Moreover, Little Red was one who coquettishly posed, thinking highly of herself. How could she be content with a silent and unnoticed existence?</p>
<p>In order not to waste her talents, she was waiting for an opportunity to show herself, hoping to gain a "quick promotion." Just like bachelors and masters who have just received their diplomas, they always want to be able to knock on the door of society and put on airs for a bit. This feeling is very understandable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Little Red's fate was ill-timed, opportunities were rare. It was hard to find an opportunity to take advantage of a void to step into the core, to offer some attentiveness to Master Bao, but she was quickly squeezed out by Master Bao's trusted servants. Qing Wen even poured a bucket of cold water on her head with both sarcasm and scolding. She was still bombed back to the periphery.</p>
<p>For her, who had high aspirations, how could she endure this? Therefore, as soon as she gained Sister Feng's favor, she immediately climbed up the high branch, happy to be of service like a dog or horse. Changing to a powerful master, she had finally achieved her initial ambition, although her personal romantic desires were still not satisfied.</p>
<p>Hong Chengchou, on the other hand, was in a different situation. He was originally a state minister of the Ming Dynasty, and the emperor trusted him exceptionally. People generally regarded him as a bulwark of the state. If he wanted to exhaust his loyalty, he had unlimited opportunities to exert his talents. The emperor would not wrong his talents. But he revolted and surrendered to the enemy, becoming a traitor to the emperor and a traitor to the nation, giving the Ming Dynasty's beautiful land to foreign tribes.</p>
<p>Therefore, comparing the two, Hong Chengchou can be said to be a petty person among gentlemen. A real petty person seems more lovable than a hypocrite, so Little Red seems a bit more intelligent than Hong Chengchou.</p>
<p>If Little Red isn't like Hong Chengchou, then who is she like?</p>
<p>Disregarding the criticism of "aping," I say: she is very much like the frustrated politicians and outdated warlords since the beginning of the Republic.</p>
<p>Let's discuss the history of internal fighting since the beginning of the Republic, up until the completion of the Northern Expedition. What actual significance did each battle have, stirring up trouble? Was it worth fighting to the death over? Yet, there was continuous fighting and killing. It was just a few ambitious people who thought highly of themselves and were unwilling to be ignored, seeking only to express themselves.</p>
<p>Today on stage, tomorrow out of office; today allied with A, tomorrow opposing B; whoever gives milk is my mother; if I'm not welcome here, I'm welcome elsewhere; all sorts of tricks to throw everything into chaos. It's just a few servants who are unwilling to accept their fate as servants stirring up trouble. Only they can understand this muddled account.</p>
<p>However, Little Red seems to be a bit stronger than them. Therefore, the shrewd and capable Sister Feng appreciated her. The "Grandma and Madam" account confused Li Wan, but she spoke fluently and logically, like mercury flowing to the ground. It's hard to blame her for not wanting to be ignored.</p>
<p>But what about those who lack talent but still don't want to be ignored? The result is harming others and ruining themselves. The politicians and warlords since the beginning of the Republic are an example. Therefore, I am deeply concerned for those who have Little Red's ambition but not Little Red's talent.</p>
<h3>Theatergoer on the Third Floor</h3>
<p>— Chu Lanfu</p>
<p>The first day of the performance of a famous amateur performer and a famous actor was like an impulse. At 4:30 in the afternoon, I rushed to the entrance of the Tianchan Theater. Unexpectedly, the iron gate was already pulled shut, and people were squeezed outside the iron gate, which was guarded by armed police with a hint of dignity, filling the entire road. The most impatient people were pushing to the front, grabbing the iron railings, unwilling to let go. With their mouths wide open, they stared inside, like prisoners who had been imprisoned for a long time, longing for freedom behind iron bars—these people were all like me, theatergoers on the third floor, with only two thousand yuan worth of purchasing power.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but sigh and lament at the gate, planning to go back. On one hand, I regretted that I was a bit too late; on the other hand, I was also Q-ing myself, congratulating myself on my two thousand yuan. Just as I was hesitating, I ran into a friend who had watched a show at this theater through the back door. He looked at my anxious expression and said, "Don't leave, I'll send you up in a while!" Coincidentally, the iron gate opened a crack again, so my friend pulled me along, taking advantage of the surge of people. We didn't go through the main entrance. The main entrance was amazing. The ticket checking area had armed guards. Whoever didn't have a ticket was driven out. We took the side door.</p>
<p>I don't know how we walked, but I followed my friend to the third-floor viewing area. It was incredible! More than half of the entire floor was already crowded with people, and the entrance was still constantly pouring in. I hurriedly occupied a seat in the fifth row. Looking at the clock, it was only 5 o'clock. On the cold stage, there was a sign that was both polite and sarcastic—"Performance starts at 8 o'clock!" Looking down, the main hall and the second floor were neatly empty, row after row of seats, not a single person.</p>
<p>But our place had turned into a lively sea. The female ushers were busy making tea, shouting "Thank you..." while squeezing back and forth. The snack vendor wore a mournful face, carrying his tray, because he was squeezed and unable to move. People who were desperately saving seats were arguing with those who came later and planned to take them, their necks red. Three or four people were fighting over a pair of binoculars to look at the empty stage... The air was filled with smoke, overflowing with various noisy sounds, creating a commotion. I was lucky to have a seat, chatting with a middle-aged man in the front row. "You're late, I came at 1:30!" he said to me in Shanghai dialect, seemingly very satisfied with his position.</p>
<p>"What great perseverance!" I couldn't help but admire. In fact, wasn't my perseverance small? From 5 o'clock to 8 o'clock, I persisted for three hours in this lively and lonely sea, and I didn't even know how I passed the time. All third-floor theatergoers—none of their perseverance is small.</p>
<p>The drum sound before the performance also aroused cheers from the crowd. The play began with the lovely ability of "cloudburst in a drought". "Killing the Fish Home" moved me very much. The scene of the fisherman and his daughter being forced to kill by evil forces was quite profound; there aren't many such plays in the old dramas. After this play, many special viewers successively appeared on the stage. These people were uniformly neat, beautiful, and modern. Their elegant and refined demeanor, and their leisurely and relaxed expressions, compared to us, really gave the feeling of "heaven and earth."</p>
<p>The play was in progress, but I was distracted by these upper-class people for most of my attention. A tall gentleman gave me even more interest, reminding me of a humorous article on people's facial features in a newspaper. The author said: "Bizarre shapes are noble features. Many nobles or wealthy people are indeed pig-shaped." This gentleman powerfully proved the author's point.</p>
<p>The play quickly ended, and I squeezed out of the theater with the crowd. Hundreds of cars were parked on several roads, waiting to welcome their owners. Dragging my extremely tired body through the gaps in the cars, I pondered when there would be a reasonable place for artistic appreciation.</p>
<h3>Serial Comic: Sanmao Joins the Army (Forty-Six)</h3>
<p>— Drawn by Zhang Leping</p>
<p>News Little World</p>
<h3>Infatuated with Women, Defeated by Women</h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>The criminal psychology of Chen Yuansheng, the main culprit in the gold brick case, is nothing more than a dissolute life and greed for money. Therefore, he was initially infatuated with women, and in the end, he was defeated by women. The four characters "wine, sex, wealth, and anger" ruined his life. At the moment he was arrested, he was still drinking alone, not expecting that "drinking to relieve sorrow only makes sorrow greater," and disaster was imminent.</p>
<p>Chen's age was exactly thirty, the golden age of his life. Unfortunately, he didn't know how to use his own "unlimited gold", and he wholeheartedly thought of taking shortcuts to make a fortune. As a result, he stole the national treasury's "limited gold", eventually ending up in prison. If he thought of the old saying, "One wrong step leads to eternal regret, and a hundred years to turn back," Chen would be filled with emotion. In this way, Chen's brain structure seems too simple, truly so-called self-smart, but was mistaken by smart!</p>
<p>Looking at Chen's behavior after the case, in the Hangzhou-Suzhou-Jiaxing area, he was searching for flowers and asking willows, mingling with women day and night, pretending to be a wealthy young master, showing an indifferent air. It is said that lust does not confuse people, but people confuse themselves. I did not expect that even in front of the Buddhist holy place Lingyin Temple, he had not yet broken the illusion. The gold bar in his pocket fell into the gully, and he still advised people that life was important and not to go down to pick it up. If Buddha is present, they will inevitably chant: "Emptiness is form, form is emptiness," Amitabha!</p>
<p>A short month of pleasure, in the end, tasted the iron window flavor, inevitably suffered the prison's stench. For Chen, the price paid was too high. Wine, sex, wealth, and anger can not be careful!</p>
<p>Shenyang reported: "Eight or nine out of ten people in Shenyang buy newspapers not to read them, but most people use the quality and quantity of paper as the standard for buying newspapers, regardless of the quality of the newspaper content." In fact, is it not the same for people in Shanghai to buy newspapers? I suspect that the millions of copies sold by the New York Times and the New York Daily News in the United States have something to do with the large-sized daily editions?</p>
<p>General Feng Yuxiang this time from Chongqing to Nanjing, abandoned the plane and boarded the boat, after arriving in Nanjing, did not talk about politics but specialized in water classics, it seems that water has occurred a great interest. This is probably due to being appointed to study water conservancy abroad and aroused a little inspiration. It is said that Feng said: "The problem of China is only the problem of water conservancy, Chairman Chiang governs the Yellow River, I will govern the Yangtze River, the two places govern well, China is also governed well."</p>
<h3>Seal Talk: Cutting with a Knife</h3>
<p>— Gao Tianxin</p>
<p>There are methods for cutting with a knife: single knife, double knife, flat knife, upright knife, cutting knife, straight knife, buried knife, frustrating knife, dancing knife, flying knife, patching knife. But according to my words, there is only the distinction between single knife and double knife, other kinds, in fact, do not need to be fully believed. But must not be fully known. Because a seal is carved, in fact, all kinds are available. If relying on one kind of knife method, it is absolutely difficult to carve a good seal. Only when holding the knife, often think of it as holding a pen, do not pretend to modify, is the only way. Just like calligraphy writing, you must not add too much, do not pretend to modify, then the vitality is exuberant, will not be rigid. Also, it must be completed in one breath, with full spirit, looking at the seal face, so that it is used by me, let me play, do not be taken by the seal face.</p>

<p>In the western United States, the average height of young women is five feet three inches and one-quarter, and the weight is one hundred and twenty-seven pounds; the average height of men is five feet eight inches and three-quarters, and the weight is one hundred and fifty-three and a half pounds.</p>
<p>This is the latest test conducted by Dr. McGann, an anthropologist at the University of California. The purpose of McGann's survey is to obtain the average length of men's and women's arms and legs for reference in improving artificial arms.</p>
<p>Among the one thousand men who participated in the test, there were many female college students; the one thousand eight hundred men included a very wide range, from seventeen to ninety years old.</p>
<p>The average length of young women's arms is as follows: full arm length is twenty and a half inches, upper arm is eleven and three-quarters inches, forearm (not including hand) is nine inches; leg length is thirty and three-quarters inches; hip circumference is twenty-two and a half inches; ankle is eight and a half inches; elbow is ten inches.</p>
<p>The average length of men's arms is: full arm length is twenty-three inches, upper arm is thirteen inches; forearm (not including hand) is ten inches; leg length is thirty-three inches; hip circumference is twenty-two inches; ankle is eight and three-quarters inches; elbow is eleven and a half inches.</p>

<h3>The Uselessness of Reading Theory</h3>
<p>— Alarming Words</p>
<p>Recently, I often hear young students say: "The national affairs are dangerous to this point, what is the use of studying painting?" I also saw a cartoon on the wall of a certain university, drawing a few skulls on top of a painting book. Young people are already not very willing to study by habit, and now they have gained theoretical support. So they officially declared a break from books under the slogan of "patriotism first, reading is useless" and embarked on a political journey. This is the post-war phenomenon in China's education community.</p>
<p>According to the Yan State News Agency, Washington, the Office of Scientific Research and Development transferred a large number of scientific documents to the Library of Congress on the 23rd, which will be distributed free of charge to universities and libraries throughout the United States. These documents are the crystallization of the Office of Scientific Research and Development's great wartime research plan. It includes physics radar radio equipment, rockets, chemistry, optics, electrical transportation, underwater operations, etc. These reports will be of great benefit to scientists, educators, and industrialists in various departments. This can represent a glimpse of the dynamics of the American academic community after the war.</p>
<p>In contrast to these two situations, we can see that people hope to build the country with science, because to lay the foundation for building the country with science, they must universally study these scientific reports. And in our country, the gentlemen who lead the youth seem to hope to build the country with politics, because to lay the foundation for building the country with politics, they are busy directing young students to write slogans and hold demonstrations. We do not necessarily disagree with students participating in political activities, and we also know that if political affairs are not on track, all other developments will be hindered. However, we would like to ask today's youth leaders to pay attention to three things. First, please correct the idea that reading is useless and guide young people to read more books. Because behavior without knowledge is blind. Second, please pay attention to the fact that the development of young people in knowledge and ability should be multifaceted, and not just mechanically instill some political doctrine. We especially want young people to pay more attention to scientific research reports and lay a good foundation for China's industrialization. Third, when you guide young people to read, your purpose is to help them pursue the truth and not to preach to them.</p>
<p>Finally, I quote a passage from Gorky and dedicate it to the young people who love activities in China:</p>
<p>'Love books, it will make your life easier; it will friendly help you to distinguish the variety and complex confusion of thoughts, feelings and various events; it will teach you to respect others and yourself; it will use the love for the world and for humanity to put wings on your intellect and soul.</p>
<p>Let it oppose your beliefs, if it is sincerely written with love for mankind and the desire for people to live better, - then this is a good book'!</p>
<h3>On "A History of Chinese Political Thought"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zhen</p>
<p>(Volume 1) Written by Xiao Gongquan, Published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>Anyone who has read Xiao Gongquan's "Political Pluralism" (Hsiao Kung-chuan: Political Pluralism A Study in Contemporary Political Theory. N.H. Harcourt London, 1927) has high expectations for Xiao Gongquan. "Political Pluralism" is an outstanding doctoral dissertation, included in the International Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method series. It has been nearly twenty years since its publication. During these years, he has seemed very quiet; apart from occasionally seeing his articles in the Tsinghua Journal and the English "T'ien Hsia Monthly," we have had few opportunities to see his works. Recently, Xiao Gongquan published his new book, "A History of Chinese Political Thought," with The Commercial Press, and this is a very noteworthy book. There are already many books circulating on the market about the history of Chinese political thought, but they all have a common problem: they all stand on a narrow viewpoint, obsessing over debating the class and identity of thinkers, the idealism or materialism of doctrines, picking a sentence here, extracting a paragraph there, almost like skilled gamblers who "call a lu and it becomes a lu, shout 'pheasant' and it becomes a pheasant." As for being able to grasp the entire thought system of a thinker and create a "narrative scholarship" work that integrates and understands, that is only Xiao Gongquan's new "A History of Chinese Political Thought." Xiao's book "narrates the thoughts of various schools, striving to maintain an objective attitude, and occasionally offers commentary, intending to clarify their historical positions, daring not arbitrarily praise or denigrate, or presumptuously judge gains and losses."</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into five parts, totaling twenty-five chapters. Part One: Political Thought of the Feudal World—The Creative Period; Part Two: Political Thought of the Autocratic World (Part 1)—The Inherited Period; Part Three: Political Thought of the Autocratic World (Part 2)—The Transformation Period. (Above) Part Four: Political Thought of the Modern Nation (Part 1)—The Transformation Period (Below). Part Five: Political Thought of the Modern Nation (Part 2)—The Mature Period.</p>
<p>The author's division into these five parts is not accidental but based on principles. The author (A) divides the more than two thousand years of Chinese political thought into four major stages according to the general trend of ideological evolution: (1) The Creative Period—from Confucius to the unification of China by Qin, lasting three hundred years, commonly known as the Pre-Qin period. (2) The Inherited Period—from the Qin and Han dynasties to the Song and Yuan dynasties, lasting about one thousand six hundred years. (3) The Transformation Period—from the early Ming dynasty to the early Qing dynasty, lasting about five hundred years. (4) The Mature Period—from the establishment of the Three Principles of the People to the present. The author (B) then divides it into the following three periods according to the historical background (political history) of the emergence of thought: (1) The Thought of the Feudal World, including the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, corresponding to the aforementioned Creative Period. (2) The Thought of the Autocratic World, including the two thousand years from the Qin and Han dynasties to the Ming and Qing dynasties, corresponding to the Inherited Period and the first part of the Transformation Period. (3) The Thought of the Modern Nation, including the reform movement in the late Qing dynasty and the Xinhai Revolution to the present, corresponding to the latter part of the Green Transformation Period and the "Mature Period." Combining the two divisions of A and B, the above five parts are formed. Volume 1 of this book specifically elucidates the political thought of the Pre-Qin period.</p>
<p>The author believes that Chinese political thought has a common characteristic, namely, taking "the world" as the object, "the meaning of the concept of 'the world' is roughly similar to the world empire of the early Middle Ages in Europe." Ancient Chinese people lacked the international concept of coexisting states, holding the view of "political solipsism." Another characteristic is the ideal of Great Harmony, "neglecting the distinctions between races, valuing the similarities and differences in culture." As a result, for two thousand years, when China was strong, it advocated the theory of "using the Xia to transform the Yi," and when foreign races came to power, it accommodated the fact of political submission, only requiring the conquerors to practice the Chinese "Way of the Former Kings" and assimilate into us, then it would kowtow and call them subjects, acknowledging the regime of different races without any shame or resentment." This proves that Chinese people only have "cultural prejudices" and not "racial prejudices." "To sum up the above points, in one word, it is the lack of the concept of a modern nation-state. ... The so-called modern nation-state has at least the following characteristics: (1) establishing a national self-determined regime, (2) recognizing the coexistence of states and their mutual relations, (3) respecting law and emphasizing institutions, rather than relying solely on human ethics and morality for governance ... (4) expanding the people's right to participate in government can also be considered one of the characteristics of a modern nation-state. These four characteristics were completely lacking in our country during the period of autocratic rule, and even in the period of division in the feudal world [i.e., the Pre-Qin period], there were only slight traces, which were only apparent similarities. The accumulation and impact of two thousand years of political thought failed to produce the concept of a modern nation-state." What is the conclusion? It can make people reflect deeply.</p>
<p>The author believes that the development of political thought in the late Zhou dynasty was due to "the rapid changes in social organization and the opportune birth of great thinkers." The late Zhou dynasty was a transitional period from the feudal world to the autocratic world. In this transitional period, "the possible attitudes of political thought were no more than three: (1) expressing nostalgia for the passing old system and attempting to maintain or restore it, (2) acknowledging the status quo, or intentionally or unintentionally catering to the new trends of the future and advocating for them, (3) feeling disgusted with all new and old systems and emphasizing personal self-sufficiency and self-comfort. ... The Confucian and Mohist schools both belonged to the first category, the Legalist thinkers belonged to the second category, and Lao Zhuang of the Daoist school and all thinkers who were 'for themselves' and hermits who only cared for their own well-being all belonged to the third category. The main schools of the Pre-Qin period were the Confucian, Mohist, Daoist, and Legalist schools. In terms of their political thought, these four schools can be divided into three major factions: "One is the rule-by-man faction, to which the Confucians and Mohists belong"; "The second is the rule-by-law faction, represented by the Legalists"; "The rule-by-man and rule-by-law factions are both active political thought. Opposing these two factions with a negative attitude is the rule-by-non-action faction represented by the Daoists."</p>
<p>Regarding the order of the emergence of various schools of thought, the author believes that "today's lack of textual evidence makes this a very difficult task. However, there are two ways to examine the order of the Pre-Qin schools: one is the order of origin, and the other is the order of establishment." According to this statement, the problem of Lao Tzu's dating, which has been debated for a long time in Chinese intellectual history, can be easily solved. The author says: "In this book, regarding the origin of Daoist thought and the birth of Lao Dan, we temporarily follow the old saying, assuming that he was before Confucius; regarding the writing of the Lao Tzu, we follow the saying of most scholars, assuming that it was after Mencius."</p>
<p>The author believes that Confucius's achievement was "based on old knowledge, establishing a scholar-official's learning for advancement and practical application, and then imparting this learning to the common people, cultivating a new ruling class based on knowledge and morality." "The starting point of Confucius's political thought was following the Zhou dynasty, and the specific proposal for its implementation was 'rectifying the ruler,' which, in modern language, means rectifying names, that is, adjusting the rights and obligations of the ruler and subjects according to the system of the flourishing Zhou dynasty's enfeoffed world." "What Confucius called benevolence is to extend the love of oneself to loving others: 'Confucius's discussion of benevolence actually melts morality, ethics, and politics into one furnace, leading man, self, family, and country into one continuous thread.'" "Confucius's methods of governance are three: nourishing, cultivating, and governing." "The tools for nourishing and cultivating are 'virtue' and 'ritual,' and the tools for governing are 'administration' and 'punishment.' "Virtue and ritual are the main, and administration and punishment are the auxiliary." Confucius believed that the purpose of the state was not only to nourish the people but also to educate the people, to transform the people into customs. The methods of transforming the people into customs are (1) "setting an example" and (2) "teaching people with the Way." The author believes that "Confucius's concept of 'administration' is not only different from what modern scholars discuss but also different from the theory of Plato in ancient Greece. Those who discuss the function of politics in modern times consider it to be nothing more than governing people and governing affairs. Confucius, on the other hand, held the view that 'administration is rectification,' believing that the main task of politics is to transform people, not to govern people, let alone govern affairs. Therefore, politics and education have the same function, and the ruler and the teacher share the same job. ... Plato also regarded morality as the highest realm of the state, and his ideal of the 'philosopher-king' is also close to Confucius's advocacy of the integration of politics and education and the unity of the ruler and teacher. However, Plato's philosopher-king is an intelligent philosopher, while Confucius's ruler-teacher is a benevolent person who values virtue. The ruler-teacher transforms people with virtue, while the philosopher-king governs the country with wisdom. Their characters and skills are both different." The author believes that the characteristic of Confucian political thought is "taking education as politics" and "taking the development of individual morality as the highest ideal of politics." Therefore, although its methods of governance combine ritual and justice with penal law, it still emphasizes ritual and justice.</p>
<p>The author's discussions of the political thought of Mencius, Xunzi, Mozi, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Guanzi, Shang Yang, and Han Feizi also have many profound, subtle, and unique insights. Due to space limitations, we cannot introduce them to readers one by one, but from the many arguments about Confucius quoted above, one can get a glimpse of them. In our opinion, this book has the following advantages: (A) The arguments are pragmatic and rigorous—the wording of this book is extremely calm, without excessive words or exaggerated arguments. Anyone who wants to seek intellectual excitement in this book will inevitably find it plain and unremarkable and be disappointed. (B) The analysis of the principles is subtle—the author's analysis of the seemingly similar but actually different doctrines of various schools is extremely detailed. For example, the Legalist thought of the Pre-Qin period and the rule-of-law thought of modern Europe seem to be almost the same at first glance, but they are actually different. The author puts it well: "The true essence of European rule-of-law thought lies in regarding law as the highest authority in the political organization. ... Therefore, the law is higher than the power of the ruler, and the monarch is bound by the law. ... This is as opposed to our country's Pre-Qin 'rule of law' thought, which takes the ruler as the main body and the law as the tool." Another example is that the Daoist and Legalist schools also seem similar at first glance, but they are actually very different. "The key point of Huang-Lao's discussion of governance is nothing more than purity and inaction, and the Legalist thinkers also occasionally express their meaning. ... Guanzi said, 'The formless emptiness is called the Way,' and 'When names are rectified and laws are prepared, the sage has nothing to do.' All these words, if placed in the Tao Te Ching, may not seem dissimilar." However, the author believes that the differences between Daoism and Legalism are at least threefold: (1) The techniques of inaction are different. The Legalists' achievement of inaction "is to achieve the realm of 'the enlightened ruler does nothing above, and the ministers tremble below' through the methods of clarifying laws and regulations, emphasizing severe punishments, and unifying education. Their skill is precisely the third-rate politics that Lao Tzu said 'the next fear it.' ... Lao Tzu achieves inaction through laissez-faire, while Shen and Han achieve inaction through autocracy." (2) The purposes of inaction are different. "The purpose of Huang-Lao's inaction is to establish pure and peaceful governance to protect the well-being of the people; the Legalist thinkers teach the monarch to practice the art of inaction to consolidate the monarch's power and establish a foundation for the country's strength." (3) The positions of the monarchs are different. Lao Tzu's "laissez-faire and tolerance are so extreme that the monarch is equivalent to being nominally established, and power cannot be exercised. The monarchs in the thoughts of Shen and Han are autocratic monarchs on the eve of the unification by the First Emperor, concentrating power in themselves and imposing rewards and punishments on the masses. ... Therefore, the inaction (so-called by the Legalists) is 'another name for hiding punishment and concealing wisdom, and cannot be mentioned in the same breath as those who are simple-minded and confuse their hearts with the world.'" (C) There are many "footnotes"—the author's deep effort in this book can be seen from the many footnotes in each chapter. Each chapter has more than a hundred footnotes, and the chapter on Shang Yang and Han Feizi has as many as one hundred and forty-two. These footnotes either indicate the origin and source of "quoted sentences" or supplement and elaborate on what is not detailed in the text. This is rare in academic works published in China. This book has many other advantages, but the author humbly says: "The author's learning is barren, and the manuscript of this book was written during the Anti-Japanese War, so it was quite inconvenient to refer to books." In fact, this is truly a harvest in the academic community in China during the Anti-Japanese War. We hope that the remaining volumes of this book can meet us soon.</p>
<h3>Several Books Welcomed for Review</h3>

The biggest reason is that the books selected for review are not of sufficient quality, and we cannot find suitable review manuscripts for the books we want to introduce. Therefore, the editors specially put forward several books to welcome reviews. Each article should be around one thousand words.</p>

<h3>"A Study of Currency and Prices"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhensheng</p>
<p>Written by Jiang Tingfu, Sold by the Author's Bookstore</p>
<p>It has been ten months since the victory, but the suffering of the people remains the same. Prices in various places continue to rise, leading to waves of strikes and slowdowns. In addition, foreign goods are coming in continuously, and all manufacturing factories have reached an extremely dangerous state. The reasons for all of this are certainly not just one, but apart from the political situation, it is the problem of currency and prices. Therefore, there has been a lot of discussion about currency and prices recently, but most of them are limited to temporary and local works, or about foreign exchange, or about price indexes, or describing the price situation in one place, etc. There are still no works on the entire issue of currency and prices. Mr. Jiang's writing of this book is indeed very suitable for the current needs.</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into eight chapters, including (1) Introduction to Currency, (2) Introduction to Prices, (3) Credit and Currency, (4) The Value of Currency, (5) Reasons for Price Fluctuations, (6) The Quantity Theory of Money, (7) The Impact of Price Fluctuations and Price Policy, (8) An Overview of Modern Price Fluctuations in China. In the first two chapters, currency and prices are analyzed and explained in detail, so that those who study currency and prices can first clearly understand the problem. Then, in Chapters 3 and 4, the evolution of currency and the various relationships that occur with price issues are studied. Chapters 5 and 6 then study the causes of price fluctuations, elaborating on various theories in detail, and then referring to the facts to establish a new theory, namely, the trade quantity theory created by Mr. Jiang in this book. Chapter 7 analyzes and explains in detail the advantages and disadvantages of price fluctuations and what kind of price policy should be applied. Finally, Chapter 8 comprehensively describes the price fluctuations in China over the years and provides evidence. The entire article is logically coherent and clearly structured, with both academic theory and facts being studied, providing a very good introductory book for those who have not studied currency and prices.</p>
<p>Examining the theories of various countries on currency and prices up to the most recent time, the quantity theory of money is the most famous. Although this theory has various shortcomings, there is still no more accurate knowledge that can overthrow and replace it. Now, Mr. Jiang overthrows this theory in this book and creates the trade quantity theory to replace it. Mr. Jiang said: "Goods existed long before currency was invented, but in the past, goods were not exchanged through currency, so there was no price problem. In the future, with the progress of world science, modern currency may be completely abolished in the future and replaced by other methods, which is also unknown. If that time comes, then prices will naturally not be a problem. But the need for goods is indispensable to human life. No matter how advanced science is, the need for goods will only increase their types and become more complex, and it is impossible to break the need for goods and maintain life. Therefore, the importance of the price problem lies in goods, not money or currency. ... Currency is just a means to be used as a medium of exchange." He also said: "Currency has undergone many changes, and recently coins have tended to be eliminated, and various transactions are mostly exchanged for credit currency and goods. ... Therefore, in the modern price problem, currency has gradually lost its importance, and the important factors that have become the price problem, in addition to goods, are transactions. No matter what form of transaction is used, if there is no transaction, there is no price problem. However, although various transactions do not all use currency for exchange, the quantity of currency is still used as the standard measure for exchange calculation. Therefore, the basic elements of the price problem, in addition to goods, are the quantity of trade." This theory does have unique insights. Mr. Jiang also believes that the velocity of money can only be applied to the era of coins, and in the era of credit currency, the velocity of goods circulation is often used instead. This statement is also quite accurate. Furthermore, Mr. Jiang has arranged the formula for the trade quantity theory according to theory and facts as:</p>
<p>QPC=E</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Jiang not only introduces many theories of currency and prices in this book, but also develops what predecessors have not developed, and overthrows the residual quantity theory of the British scholar Keynes and the transaction quantity theory of the American scholar Fisher, and establishes a new theory to replace them. Therefore, this book is an extremely good book for those who have already studied the problem of currency and prices to increase their research materials.</p>
<p>This book is detailed in its description of facts and clear in its analysis. In the first chapter, the evolution of currency is described in detail, concisely and comprehensively, for both China and other countries. In the second chapter, the meaning, function, and calculation methods of the price index are explained one by one in great detail, so that readers can immediately understand the function and calculation of the index. In the sixth chapter, the origin of the quantity theory of money and the various theories of currency by scholars from various countries over the years are described in detail, so that one can understand the evolution of currency theory in various countries around the world. In the eighth chapter, the price fluctuations and their causes in our country since the Republic of China are divided into two periods, the first period from the first year of the Republic of China to the twenty-fourth year, and the second period from the twenty-fifth year to the present, with each period described in detail and accompanied by various extremely valuable index tables. Therefore, this book is also a rare reference book for those who generally study the problem of currency and prices.</p>
<h3>Review of "Frosty Leaves Red as February Flowers"</h3>
<p>— Yao Jun</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Dun's voluminous work "Frosty Leaves Red as February Flowers," which is approximately 1.5 million words in length, has had its first part, approximately 150,000 words, published by Huahua Bookstore. It uses the decade of the Republic of China, the May Fourth era, as its backdrop, providing a detailed description of the society at that time. The old society was shaken by the impact of the currents of the times and had begun to waver, but the reactionary forces were putting up a strong struggle, reflecting the twilight years, and these frosty leaves were as red as spring flowers.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Dun set this story in a small county near a city, which can eliminate superficial things and allow people to see the situation of Chinese society at that time more clearly, and also make the theme more prominent.</p>
<p>Here, there is a conflict between the old landlord class and the new capitalist class, with scheming, backstabbing, and open and secret attacks; here, there is the confusion and distress of the more righteous intellectual youth. The author strings these together, interweaves them, and writes a moving epic.</p>
<p>The representative of the old landlord class is Zhao Shouyi and his group, who have seized the savings of the charitable hall for more than ten years and are unwilling to publish the accounts. Their opponent, the representative of the new capitalist class, Wang Boshen and his group, are using the excuse of running a poor people's apprenticeship to force him to spit out the fat meat he has eaten. However, Zhao Shouyi immediately launches a counterattack, alleging that the ships of Wang Boshen's shipping company are running in shallow inland rivers, causing the river water to constantly destroy the people's fields on the banks. Zhao Shouyi then sends his henchmen Xu Shixiu and Cao Zhicheng to instigate farmers to attack the ships. Wang Bozong uses the police to suppress them, killing a village child. This matter is ignited, but they reconcile. The capital on one side is the loss of the villagers and the life of a child, and the capital on the other side is the public accumulation of the charitable hall, public property, and the losses are still suffered by the common people.</p>
<p>The intellectual youth who are confused and distressed are first and foremost Zhang Fu's young master Xunru. His family arranged for him to marry the current young mistress, but he is enamored of his cousin Xu Jingxin. He always wants to go out and do something, but his grandmother wants him to stay at home and guard the family business; he is dissatisfied with the status quo, but he cannot change the current environment. The second is Xunru's brother-in-law Huang Heguang, who has enough family wealth to live comfortably for the rest of his life, and a beautiful and talented wife, but due to his physical defects, he cannot fully fulfill his duties as a husband, let alone carry on the family line, and has therefore become addicted to opium, leaving him listless, and he is unwilling to ruin his life in this way. The third is Xunru's cousin Qian Liangcai. Among these three protagonists, he is the most promising. He has passion and courage, and wholeheartedly wants to do something for the local area, willing to sacrifice his own interests. When the ships constantly destroy the fields, he opposes Cao Zhicheng's instigation of the villagers to attack the ships and teaches the farmers in the village to shrink the land and build embankments, sacrificing a small number of low-lying fields to protect the interests of the majority, and the losses are shared by everyone. He does this with the belief that it is "beneficial to everyone," but when he understands that everyone is unwilling but obedient to him, his confidence is shattered again. In the power struggle between Zhao Shouyi and Wang Boshen, he also emerges to try to exchange a small human life for a local public service, but in the end, he becomes a difficult person, and those who take advantage are still Zhao Shouyi and Wang Boshen. His confusion and distress are deeper than those of Xunru and Heguang.</p>
<p>Why did the reform movement at that time accomplish nothing? Zhu Xingjian, a gentleman who was out of touch with the times in the book, said: "... We learn from others' electrical lighting, and it still looks somewhat like it, but when we learn about laws and regulations, it is completely inconsistent, why is this? ..."</p>
<p>Why is this? Huang Heguang said: "I think there are too many people in the world who are neither good nor bad, but can be good or bad, which is why they allow bad people to act recklessly?"</p>
<p>"Why does a person become someone who can be good or bad? ... If he doesn't know what is good and what is bad, but why can everyone say what is good and what is bad? Since they can say it, why can't they do it?" Qian Liangcai asked: "You, me, the three of us, do we count as a group that can be good or bad? If we are also capable of being good or bad, have we ever thought about what is the reason?"</p>
<p>At that time, Zhu Xingjian, Qian Liangcai, and others could only understand this point. Mr. Mao Dun did not go further in preaching here, but left this question behind.</p>
<p>Frosty leaves are red as February flowers, and even now, aren't they still so red? More than twenty years have passed since that era, and do we still have the same views on this issue as Qian Liangcai and the others did at that time!</p>
<p>I feel that Mr. Mao Dun's novels absorb and melt the advantages of old Chinese novels. For example, in this "Frosty Leaves Red as February Flowers," the arrangement of the story begins with Rui Gu's wife returning to Zhang's residence and chatting with the old lady as an introduction, narrating the family history of the characters who appear, and then using the movement of the characters to bring the story to another occasion, developing layer by layer, and finally using Wan Xiaojie adopting a stepdaughter as a conclusion, which is coherent and not far-fetched. Also, in terms of character handling, he uses frontal descriptions, side衬托 from the mouths of other characters, and the protagonist's own dialogues, debates, and analyses to make each character's personality and character very vivid and prominent. These are all things we often see in old novels. There are many such examples in this book, but due to space limitations, I cannot list them in detail here.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Dun's style is characterized by plain drawing, which is clear, stable, and meticulous, developing layer by layer, without any far-fetchedness or deliberate shock value, but rather profound and realistic. This style is not easy for inattentive readers to appreciate, and as a result, they feel a bit dull.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zuxiang's review of "Frosty Leaves Red as February Flowers" is a bit "cultural," which refers to the many debates and analyses in the book, but these can be used to express the characters' thoughts and personalities, which is a strength of old novels. As long as it does not fall into the cliché of psychological description, this technique can be adopted.</p>

<h3>Record of Ding Xilin</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Shortly after the May Fourth Movement, I saw several early popular comedies and farces, which were simple and easy to understand. Suddenly, seeing Ding Xilin's "A Wasp," I felt it stood out from its peers, a breath of fresh air. It gave us an unusual feeling of novelty. This collection is a compilation of several one-act plays, in which the dialogue is beautiful, humorous, and speaks in riddles. Not only is it not annoying, but it is also pleasing. Many witty phrases, only he could think of. Among them, "Oppression" is the most popular, and I don't know how many theater troupes have performed it. I once took his "Peking Air" and selected it for my "Junior High School Mixed Mandarin Textbook" as an example of rhetoric and style, because this article says good things about servants everywhere, but in fact, it says bad things about servants everywhere.</p>
<p>In order to commemorate the May Fourth Literary and Art Festival, the All-China Literary and Art Association decided to invite this May Fourth era writer to give a speech and perform his "Oppression." In this time of housing shortage in Shanghai, it is also very meaningful to replay this play. The day before yesterday, I made a special trip to the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica to see him, to arrange things in advance. It was drizzling at this time, and although I felt a little inconvenient, I went with an excited heart. Finally, I saw him walking leisurely into a reception room. He already had a lot of white hair on his head, and his kind smile gave people the feeling of a kind mother. I instantly became a child, bathed in the warm radiance. He told me that he would go to Nanjing on the day of the Literary and Art Festival, and the Academia Sinica was building an observatory there, so he had to go and see it. Although he was not invited, and later "Oppression" was not performed, I was still happy to have the opportunity to see the writer I admired. I still walked out of that garden of moist trees in the drizzling rain.</p>
<p>It was also a drizzling day, at night, I put on my raincoat and went to the Carlton to see the performance of Ding Xilin's new work, "When Madam Returns." Coincidentally, Xilin was sitting in the row in front of me, watching attentively the creation he had cultivated himself. First, a short play, "Three Dollars National Currency," was performed. Both of these plays write about servants, but they are different from "Peking Air." The former describes a young master and young lady pulling a maid to sit down and have tea together, and the maid sits down uneasily after being modest. The latter describes a university student who, dissatisfied with a mistress firing a maid, vents his anger by breaking another vase and compensating her with three dollars in national currency, because this was the price she set for the maid to compensate for breaking the vase. Both of these points illustrate what kind of person the author is, sympathizing with the plight of the maid.</p>
<p>"When Madam Returns" tells the story of a father who is a traitor, and his eldest daughter and son-in-law agree with him, but his wife, son, and youngest daughter object to this matter. The result is the departure of the three objectors. The son packed his luggage one morning, preparing to leave without his mother's knowledge. Unexpectedly, the mother came downstairs and said to him that the sound of packing luggage could wake anyone up, and also told him that she had bought three boat tickets, and she and her youngest sister would go with him. Before leaving, she lied to the eldest daughter, saying that she was escorting her son to retrieve the luggage, and also gave the maid a lot of money. The maid was baffled and asked the eldest lady, who told her to ask the madam "when Madam returns."</p>
<p>This play was written in the third year of the War of Resistance. If the environment had allowed it to be performed at that time, it would have aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience. National righteousness should always be promoted, but the era and demands of the current audience are different. Shallow as I am, I don't quite understand "Miaofeng Mountain," just like I don't understand Cao Yu's "Peking Man," but I like "Miaofeng Mountain." It contains the consistent style of the "Xilin One-Act Play Collection." The whimsical events and dialogues gave me a novel stimulus. The style of these two dramas is different from before. It seems that they have changed from gorgeous to plain, or rather, they are closer to realism, easy to understand, and approachable. Probably Mr. Ding felt the great push of the War of Resistance, heard and witnessed many moving events, and wrote this righteous drama with justice. At this time, he had no time to take care of his skills. He didn't want to use those little tricks anymore. He only felt a surging force urging him to write, and he wrote it down in one breath. When the play was about to be finished, he breathed a sigh of relief, and then he remembered the "Xilin style," so he gave us an unusual ending at the end.</p>
<p>After the play was over, Liang Lin stood up and buttoned his wife's raincoat. I shook hands with him to say goodbye, and took the opportunity to ask him a few questions about the script. He was quite bewildered, perhaps afraid that people would discover or notice who he was. This shows his humility. He is not the Oscar Wilde who wears lilies in his chest and swaggered through the market.</p>
<h3>Wild Cat (Novel)</h3>
<p>— Chi Zhao</p>
<p>These days, after school, when I bring the three children home from school, Lan'er, who is only five years old and not yet in school, always has a lot of news to tell us. He pouts his little mouth and waves his little hands, saying:</p>
<p>"This morning, the mom downstairs bought two chicks!"</p>
<p>"Loquats cost seven hundred dollars a catty, and Auntie Ji in the front building bought a big basket!"</p>
<p>"Ah Ye ate two zongzi at noon today!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>His conclusion every time is: "Dad, let's buy them too!" At that time, his index finger was always in his little mouth, showing a gluttonous look.</p>
<p>Lan'er's words are of the greatest interest to his third and second brothers, and they listen to them the most attentively, but whenever Lan'er says, "Dad, let's buy them too!" the eldest brother always pulls his little hand and disturbs him, saying, "Tell your brother!"</p>
<p>Looking at the situation on the road and in the neighbors' homes, I also know that the Dragon Boat Festival is coming soon, but... when I think of that problem, I am always silent in the face of the children's innocent demands. Ren'er Xin is a twelve-year-old child, and growing up in a poor environment has created his melancholy character. Perhaps because he is older than his three younger brothers, he also seems to understand more about human relationships and the world. He is often the eighth one in the family to solve problems and disputes. However, whenever I think of the "precocious" character of the eldest son formed by suffering, I feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>It was the day before the Dragon Boat Festival, and it was late at night. My wife inspected the sleeping state of the four children. She breathed a sigh of relief and lay on the bed. At that time, I had finished grading the papers. She said:</p>
<p>"The day after tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival. These days, the children see people buying things to eat, and they stare at them longingly. It's quite pitiful. We should also buy some to celebrate the occasion."</p>
<p>"Hmm!" I was thinking.</p>
<p>"The second landlord downstairs bought a dou of glutinous rice and wrapped more than a hundred zongzi. The front building also bought five sheng. Other things like chickens and loquats have been bought. We should also buy two sheng of glutinous rice and two catties of loquats. Although we can't afford chicken, we should also buy two catties of fish and meat. And the children haven't eaten meat for a month or two. We should make them happy during the holidays. It's pitiful to just watch other people eat." My wife continued to say a lot.</p>
<p>Speaking of the children's pitifulness, what father doesn't understand the truth. And my family's four children, because they are usually accustomed to a situation where not every request is granted, are especially obedient. What they say and what they eat all follow their parents' instructions. They never cry or stomp their feet to ask for food or play. However, when I think that celebrating a festival like my wife said will cost the price of two dou of rice, and two dou of rice can support a family of six for ten days of congee and rice, I hesitated. I was even more silent. I thought that I was a poor teacher from a fallen scholar-official class. I only have tens of thousands of yuan in tuition fees per month, and I can't even support a month's living expenses, so where does this extra expense come from?</p>
<p>"You, what do you mean?" My wife urged me for an answer, as if impatient with the silence.</p>
<p>I sighed, got up, picked up a cigarette and smoked it. The sleeping postures of the four children came into view. I walked up to their bed and gently stroked them—their malnourished faces and limbs. I finally agreed to my wife's suggestion and said that the cost should not exceed 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Under the light, I saw a blush on my wife's overworked, thin, and sallow face, and her tightly furrowed brows also relaxed. She also said excitedly, as if forgetting a day's fatigue:</p>
<p>"When the festival comes, fish and meat will definitely be more expensive than usual. It's better to buy them tomorrow morning and cook them well, waiting to eat them on the day of the festival."</p>
<p>The next day, when the children got up, my wife told them what she was going to buy today. The youngest three children all clapped their little hands, but the eldest son was still unmoved, urging them to wash up. Lan'er didn't even wipe his face. He hurried out of the room to tell his little companion in the same room:</p>
<p>"We are buying fish, buying meat, buying loquats, and wrapping zongzi today." He said, with saliva splattering everywhere.</p>
<p>"What about the chicks? Are you buying them or not? We have chicks." The little girl downstairs asked him.</p>
<p>Lan'er hurried back, pulled on his wife's clothes, and said:</p>
<p>"Mom, are we buying chicks or not?" He waited with wide eyes for an answer.</p>
<p>"Buy, buy, we'll buy everything!" Before his wife could answer, the eldest son said angrily.</p>
<p>"Buy, buy, we'll buy everything!" Lan'er also grabbed the railing and said to the little girl downstairs.</p>
<p>When I came home from school, my wife had already wrapped the zongzi, simmered two bowls of braised pork, and there was also a section of salted fish. Needless to say, the loquats were also bought.</p>
<p>The braised pork was so cute, simmered in soy sauce until it was golden and shiny, each piece like a "mahjong tile," and a strong aroma aroused several pairs of little eyes to blink and twinkle at it.</p>
<p>It was time for dinner, and because the children couldn't forget it, they were only allowed to eat two pieces of braised pork first. Little faces were full of smiles, and Lan'er and the others only sucked on the meat and sent it to their rice, reluctant to swallow it.</p>
<p>"Today, the price of meat is 2,500 yuan per catty. It's worth more than a hundred dollars a piece. You guys taste it carefully." My wife said, and also revealed a proud smile. The eldest son stuck out his tongue.</p>
<p>"Last year, during the Dragon Boat Festival, when we used counterfeit money, it was only 1,500 yuan per catty. This year, it's up another thousand. In recent days, the price of all kinds of vegetables has gone up. It's difficult to eat even vegetable roots!" My wife said with emotion again.</p>
<p>After dinner, after washing and changing the children, my wife considered the problem of storing the fish and meat, because the weather was hot. If they were placed in the cupboard, they might rot, which would be a pity, so the result was to decide to put them on the table by the window, which was the most suitable place for ventilation.</p>
<p>The children were thinking about having good things to eat when they woke up the next day, and they were already sound asleep. My wife was busy all day, and she also seemed to have completed a major task today, and she was also fast asleep. I also seemed to have fulfilled my most basic responsibility, and I also slept peacefully, only being awakened once by the noisy cats fighting on the roof. I pushed my wife who was sleeping next to me, but she was as if she didn't know anything.</p>
<p>On the morning of the Dragon Boat Festival, when I hadn't woken up yet, I was awakened by the voices of my wife and children. I felt as if something had gone wrong.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Why are you arguing so early in the morning?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Dad, Dad, the meat and fish were stolen by a wild cat," the children shouted.</p>
<p>"Mom put the fish and meat on the table last night, and the cat ate them all!" The eldest son also said with a complaining tone.</p>
<p>I got out of bed and saw that my wife was looking frustrated, and her eyes were much brighter. The section of salted fish that I was looking forward to was gone, and half of each of the two bowls of meat was gone. I couldn't help but be stunned.</p>
<p>"Eating so much, it must have been eaten by more than one dead cat." My wife muttered. "It's almost half of 2,500 yuan per catty that was eaten, and that section of fish also cost 2,500 yuan." My wife sighed.</p>
<p>I wanted to say that I had heard the cats fighting last night, but I was afraid that my wife and children would blame me, so I had to change my tone and comfort them, saying:</p>
<p>"It's okay, it's okay, it only ate half of it."</p>
<p>Afterwards, my wife and I discussed. She said that this matter could not be publicized to the co-residents and neighbors, because if the fish and meat were eaten by cats, it would be easy to just buy some more, but where could we afford to buy them again? If we didn't buy them, wouldn't we be laughed at? So it's better not to let people know about this matter and just tighten our stomachs and pretend to be decent. The three older children were still sensible, but they were afraid that Lan'er would let it slip, so my wife was scaring Lan'er, saying that he was not allowed to tell anyone about this kind of thing. In Lan'er's little heart, it was as if something big had happened at home, and he was only depressed all day long, and he didn't say anything to anyone.</p>
<p>Although I didn't agree with my wife's suggestion, I thought that I couldn't live alone, and I sympathized with my wife's situation, so I didn't say anything. It was only pitiful that the children were also taught to lie by my wife.</p>
<p>That day, we closed the door and ate dinner. My wife and I only listened silently to the sound of the neighbors and co-residents drinking and playing finger-guessing games. The children were still happy, because there was still meat left for the wild cat to eat, and there were loquats to eat, and there were...</p>
<h3>Raft</h3>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>— Ren Quan</p>
<p>Friend!</p>
<p>Although it's only been a day, it feels like a century!</p>
<p>From the time we shook hands and said goodbye in front of the ×× Hall this morning, until now when I'm writing this at home under the quiet lamp, I feel like I've had a bewildered dream. It seems vague, but it is indeed real. Although it is real, it is as light and distant as a dream. Even though I know that this is an unavoidable fact that must be faced, I still like to savor it like reminiscing about a dream. Now I've come to a conclusion—I'm sitting alone under the lamp writing a letter, just like when we wrote a letter of peace to our parents on the first night we entered the dormitory a few years ago.</p>
<p>Did you sleep well last night? I was afraid you'd catch a cold. Although everyone forgot about the cold because of excitement, the night wind was carrying the autumn air. "The stars are not as they were last night, for whom do I stand in the wind and dew?" But who could give up this last night of reunion at our alma mater? Heaven also seemed to have specially arranged for us the most beautiful and moving night. The moon, which hadn't been seen for days, finally showed its face last night. And it also brought us the most caressing and gentle illumination, allowing us to bathe in its loving light, to make noise as we pleased, and to laugh to our hearts' content. The city sounds all around were dead silent. Only the wind sighed in the treetops. Our young laughter overflowed in the embrace of our alma mater, and it will echo forever. On every night of June 15th, it will become an eternal echo for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Finally, we saw a lunar eclipse again; this was a novel experience for many of us. But it was a coincidence that we saw this celestial phenomenon last night. When we watched the full moon being swallowed by the shadow, we all felt黯然. Is it going to be missing again so quickly? It made us think of the parting that was about to happen to us. We also shed tears sadly; for the friendship from the time we braided our pigtails until we graduated together, we shed tears at this beautiful universe. The bright tears will coalesce and illuminate the many, many days that await us. I used to have this sentence: "A man's tears are only shed for the mountains and rivers." Tonight, I feel that these tears are also worth shedding.</p>
<p>The stars moved, and we were still talking and laughing. Beautiful futures floated before everyone's eyes. In the highest and most beautiful hope, we established our confidence. Why can't we make tonight the most meaningful night in our future memories? Silently, we all made vows to take on the work of making this world a better place. Now we feel the existence of the great and the small. Although some of us have some very small grievances, from now on, I believe, they should all be gently released from the silent mutual understanding.</p>
<p>In a person's life, there are many serious and beautiful responsibilities; these responsibilities are unconsciously shouldered by us and unconsciously completed by us. Before, when we entered school, we didn't understand anything, and we only knew how to run and jump, laugh and make noise. However, unintentionally and invisibly, we have shouldered a serious and beautiful responsibility. We are for learning, for enriching ourselves, and for educating ourselves. Now a stage can be declared complete. The classmates who have been together for several years during the occupied period are about to part ways. Unconsciously, we have shouldered another serious and beautiful responsibility, which is mutual love and friendship. If we can be competent, we will complete one of the most valuable tasks in the universe. If countless people besides us can be competent, this world will become a more suitable place for humans to live.</p>
<p>Last night, I didn't sleep well at all. In the deep of night, I seemed to hear someone sobbing quietly. I was so annoyed that I had to repeatedly recite the verses in "Cherishing the Past" until I fell asleep drowsily. The night was too short.</p>
<p>Friend, we should always be together.</p>

<h3>Scribbles from the Sculpture Studio (II)</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Types of Sculpture</p>
<p>There are many types of sculpture based on the material used—wood carving, stone carving, clay sculpture, terracotta, dry lacquer, bronze casting, ivory carving, iron pen carving, etc.</p>
<p>Wood carving and modeling are more common in the Orient than in the West, and the techniques are unique and tasteful, and the history is also long. In the Western method of wood carving, a clay model must first be sculpted, and then the clay model is turned into plaster, and then carved according to the model (the same is true for the stone carving production process). The Orient is different. For example, the wood-carved Buddhist statues in various temples and ancestral halls are mostly carved out of a whole piece of wood. Sometimes hands and feet are added separately. Although their shapes are not as realistic as those in the West, their simple, dignified, and solemn expressions are far beyond the reach of Western works. Modeling in the Orient, especially in China, also has an ancient method of using hemp cloth and lacquer. As far back as the Buddhist statues sculpted by Yang Hui of the Tang Dynasty in Jiaozhi, Suzhou, they are still as complete as new after nearly a thousand years. This is also something that Westerners cannot dream of, because modeling in the West is only used as a practice or a model for bronze casting, stone carving, and wood carving. The wood used for wood carving can be camphor, cypress, cherry, osmanthus, magnolia, or boxwood. In our country, ordinary devout men and women seek holiness and piety when carving Buddhist statues, and sometimes use sandalwood, but the number is very small. Camphor is not easily infested by insects, boxwood is easy to carve, cherry wood has beautiful patterns, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The authors also have their own preferences. In the Western Middle Ages, wood carvings were mostly used for temple decoration, and there are also many modern writers who are good at wood carving. Maillol can be regarded as one with a stronger interest. P. Gauguin also made many wood carvings in the style of natives in Tahiti, which were quite interesting.</p>
<p>Stone carvings were very common in ancient Egypt and Greece in the West. They mostly used white marble produced in Carrara, Italy, which has a fine, delicate, and lustrous texture, and the sculptures made from it are extremely beautiful. Modern writers have also made many of them, and Rodin also likes to use it. Stone carving was also popular in ancient China, but it gradually declined after the Song Dynasty. Although some people still advocated it in the Ming Dynasty, the number was very small. The stone figures and beasts in front of the Ming Mausoleum in Jinling, which still exist today, differ from those of the Tang Dynasty because they were influenced by Hungary.</p>
<p>Dry lacquer carving is made by mixing clay and sawdust with raw lacquer. The Jigong statue in Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou uses this method. It does not crack after many years and is extremely durable. In recent years, it has been adopted by the Japanese, but the Chinese do not pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Bronze casting, whether in the East or the West, was extremely prosperous in ancient times. Its production is as described above. A clay model must first be sculpted, then turned into plaster, then turned into a sand mold, and then molten metal is poured into it to form the final product. Gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead can all be used for it. Generally, bronze is more common, and the production process is very complicated.</p>
<p>Ivory carving was mostly used to carve statues of the Virgin Mary in the Western Middle Ages, and was also often used to carve statues of Guanyin in China during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Western and Chinese art resonated with each other in an invisible way.</p>
<p>Iron pen carving, because its carving knife is like a pen, is used to carve bamboo utensils. Many Orientals are good at this technique, and their interest is also stronger, perhaps because bamboo is produced there.</p>
<p>Terracotta is a type of sculpture made of clay and fired in a kiln. It has been quite popular in the West in recent years. Yixing in China also has it, but they are all made by craftsmen, so the taste is low.</p>
<p>Classifying sculpture by technique, there are three-dimensional carving, relief carving, intaglio carving, and line carving. Ordinary sculptures that can be viewed from all sides are called three-dimensional carvings. Relief carving and intaglio carving are a kind of product that mixes sculpture and painting. Like painting, it can only be viewed from one side. The difference is that in addition to giving people visual appreciation, it also has a sense of touch. Line carving, it is much better to say that it is painting than that it is sculpture, because it only uses different tools.</p>
<h3>Views on Love</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Zhongyuan Jun wrote a piece called "Mother" in the Chunqiu column of this newspaper. When I read it, it seemed that the words were filled with tears of extreme affection. When I finished speaking the last sentence, I felt a burst of unbearable sadness in my heart, and tears followed down. Of course! I also have the same maternal love as Zhongyuan Jun, but my mother has also left this world. However, I don't have the wonderful writing skills to describe it as vividly and movingly as Zhongyuan Jun. My view on love is that any kind of love in mankind cannot compare to the greatness of maternal love. Since ancient times, mothers have loved their children, and it can be said that there is nothing they will not do. True love is revealed, and everything is overwhelmed. Anyone can experience this, but there are few children in the world who love their mothers, and some even hate their mothers. Daughters are more obedient and considerate in comparison. You should know that if you don't love your mother, your children may not treat your wife as a mother in the future. Therefore, in a family, we must first transfer the love for our wives to the love for our mothers, first to repay them, which is only right and proper. Secondly, set an example, first for the wife to see, and then for the children to learn, isn't that right?</p>
<p>Between men and women, only the word "private" can be said. "Private" is a subjective view, not pure, and without true affection. To put it bluntly, it cannot escape mutual exploitation. There is no talk of affection, let alone love, so maternal love is the true and supreme love of mankind.</p>
<p>I hope that texts like "Mother" written by Zhongyuan Jun will be published more in the newspaper, so that those who do not understand the true meaning of maternal love can shift their vision on their views on love.</p>

<h3>Two Birds Flying Together (66)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Madam Mo couldn't help but console Second Madam Weng for a while. Fortunately, her own mood wasn't infected; she was still happy with the anticipation of infinite hope. She didn't fully understand what Shi Yulou had said earlier, nor did she need to. The only thing she cared about now was tomorrow's glory. She imagined that after Lihua went on stage tomorrow, the entire theater audience would applaud and cheer for Lihua. Then, the theater manager would give her a thumbs up and ask to sign a contract with her. From then on, Lihua would become the star of this theater; from then on, she could receive a fixed "salary" every month (the fixed remuneration for actors); from then on, her life would be carefree! Thinking of this, she couldn't help but smile as she prepared Lihua's new clothes for the New Year. She then brought Lihua before her and affectionately stroked her, saying:</p>
<p>"Xiaohua, you'll be ten years old tomorrow, and tomorrow is your first time on stage! Don't let Mom down! Sing well and perform attentively. In three days, your teacher said you can officially 'enter the sea' [begin a professional singing career]. In the future, when you earn money, Mom will let you eat well, dress well, and enjoy a lifetime of happiness."</p>
<p>Lihua didn't say a word, as if she hadn't heard Madam Mo's words.</p>
<p>"Child, don't be shy when you're on stage. With your teacher playing the huqin for you, just be like you're at home. Sing as you should sing, and perform as you should perform. Don't panic or be afraid at all," Madam Mo earnestly urged again.</p>
<p>Lihua remained silent as before, staring at the ceiling with an indifferent expression on her face.</p>
<p>Seeing that Lihua didn't speak, Madam Mo thought she was sleepy, so she urged her to go to bed.</p>
<p>"Go to sleep early and get up early tomorrow to wear your new clothes!" Madam Mo said.</p>
<p>Only then did Lihua "hum" and walk away.</p>
<p>In fact, Lihua wasn't sleepy at all; her mind was filled with chaotic thoughts. But she didn't feel particularly sad; she just felt strange! Strange that Madam Mo didn't use other methods to make her "earn money." She knew there were many ways to earn money, such as working as a servant for others; she could sweep the floor, wash dishes, and take care of children. She didn't think these were hardships. She could also go to a tailor shop to sew clothes and do rough needlework for people. She saw many young girls working there in the tailor shop. But Madam Mo refused to do that!! She only chose the path of earning money through singing! Shi Yulou had even said earlier that singing was to "relieve boredom" for people, which was clearly not a good thing. Even Shi Yulou resented this profession, but Madam Mo wanted her to do it. What's the logic? She didn't understand! But she didn't want to disobey Madam Mo. She had been beaten and suffered. Now that she had learned this profession, she could only do it! As for the matter of going on stage tomorrow, she only felt a sense of blankness. She remembered seeing Shi Yulou singing on stage; she and many other people were staring at Shi Yulou from the audience, and Shi Yulou seemed not to see them, just singing his songs. So, tomorrow she would also sing on stage, letting many people stare at her from the audience. Would she be shy? But even if she was shy, she had to sing! So she decided that she could only learn from Shi Yulou, pretending not to see so many people, and just sing her part.</p>
<p>"Singing is clearly something to make people happy, but that bad sister mistakenly took singing as a 'toy'!"</p>
<p>Lihua said to herself. She understood this awareness, and she couldn't help but laugh at Lihua's childishness in treating singing as a toy.</p>
