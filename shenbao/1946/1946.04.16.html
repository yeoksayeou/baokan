<h3>長胡形勢極度緊張　共軍多方面攻入市區　北上國軍進駐四平街</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十五日電〕長春已入極緊張狀態，此問空軍方面今日上午接長春電吿，長春機塲之空軍地動人員，十五日晨起已與市內內人員失去聯絡，該機塲可能已被共軍攻陷。由瀋北上國軍，現抵達四平街附近，共軍正力阻國軍北進。按四平街北距長春約六十餘公里。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十五日上午十時電〕長春現被共軍圍攻甚急，戰事澈夜未停，槍砲聲密如聯珠，共軍業自多方面攻入市區，情况極爲危殆，訊者之發電工作業已受阻，各方盼援軍甚切。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽十五日電〕據息，北上接防國軍先頭部隊，於十五日上午十時進入四平街，老四平街及八面城，共軍紛紛北竄。又據交通界息，楡錦段被破壞後，週餘未通車，頃工程隊在國軍掩護下日夜搶修竣事，十五日已可通車，客車亦將恢復。</p>
<p>〔聯合社長春十五日電〕長春爭奪戰，已在進行中，共軍佔據市外三處飛機塲後，已進迫市區。國軍防守司令陳家珍少將，現保留其主力，守衛市中心區。此區密佈長戰壕·鐵絲網·阻礙物及泥石砌成之槍砲位，國軍司令部設中央銀行大厦，述同其他建築物多處，均高疊沙袋。共軍現正從北面進攻火車站，國軍裝甲火車一列往來行駛，向共軍射擊，交戰武器有步槍·機關槍·平射砲·手溜彈·迫擊砲·共軍方面且有大砲助戰，傳共軍係由新四軍將領指揮，利用日軍武器作戰，國軍方面相信，是項日軍武器乃蘇軍於數月前撥交共軍使用者。</p>
<h3>褚逆已誼審訊終結　廿二日下午宣判　答辯數小時自願一死了之</h3>
<p>蘇高院十五日下午二時廿五分開審褚連民誼，仍由院長孫鴻　任審判長，刑庭長石美瑜任首席推事，此外尙有推事陸家瑞，首席檢察官韓　，書記官秦達立。褚逆係於二時廿分乘其生平一向提倡之馬車解到，訊問年齡。籍貫後，褚逆曾朗讀其繁冗瑣屑之辯護書近三小時之久。五時零五分庭諭休息十分鐘，訊問後，宣吿調査證據完畢，首檢韓　起而論吿，由褚及高院公職辯護人高溶辯論一過，七時十五分庭上宣吿辯論終結，定本月廿二日下午三時宣判，旋即退庭，褚逆還押。十五日法院旁聽席上仍極擁擠，不亞審訊陳　公博之時，旁聽證共發三百八十五張，而旁聽者超出此數極多，遲至者幾無立足之地。開庭時，秦書記官起立稱。今日審理褚民誼漢奸一案，庭上問年齡籍貫時，褚逆稱六十四歲，浙江吳興人，離家鄕已多年，住南京西康路廿一號，庭上訊其職業，答稱：讀書出身，曾赴法日留學，得醫學博士學位，回國後任廣東大學敎授，民十四代校長，民十五北伐，任革命軍經理處長，事變前從事敎育·醫藥及黨務，家屬有　及三子，二女。庭上問財產少？答：可慟得很，祗南京怡和路卅四號房屋一所，係戰前所造，上海並無產業。</p>
<p>起訴意旨</p>
<p>於是韓宣布起訴意旨，略謂：被吿加人國民黨甚早，歷任中央執委，行政院秘書長等要職，乃於民國廿七年汪逆兆銘與日寇謀議和之際，往來京滬，與　其事，與維新及臨時二僞組織謀組僞政府，終於廿九年三月成立，汪任僞主席兼行政院長，被吿副之，且兼外交部長，曾隨陳逆公博赴日答謝，復與日人簽訂中日基本條約，並發表中日滿共同宣言，喪權辱國，承認僞滿，斷送東北四省，復任僞駐日大使，向各國聯絡，僞府獲得德·義等九國之承認。卅年九月回國，仍任外交部長，對英美盟邦宣戰，被告竭力欲使各國承認僞府，實即係以正式政府自居，無異反對中央，而其向盟邦宣戰，實即無異於向中央宣戰。卅二年十月，復與日訂同盟條約，十一月又隨汪逆參加大東亞會議，通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國之罪行，極爲顯著。又彼於行政院副院長任內，曾許敵在其佔領區內設華北振興公司及中支那振興公司，並在其下設分公司十五處，行政。交通。糧食。礦產，無不受敵統制，任其處分。在粤省長任內’復與敵聯絡部長松井商定，增加粤海關稅八萬萬地獄，以半數供敵，半供省款，資敵之罪尤顯，應請依法審判云云。</p>
<p>褚逆答辯</p>
<p>孫審判長即命褚逆答辯，褚即提上玳瑁眼鏡展　其答辯書，惟此文極支離瑣碎，答非所問之處旣多，復多本案全不相關之處，略謂：（一）彼與汪雖是聯襟而在法留學時，與汪同學，加入同盟會後，又爲同志，師事汪逆，任事後，汪爲長官，彼爲僚屬，故關係之深，實不止因親屬之故，對在爲人允極敬佩。（二）事變前致力黨務·敎育·醫藥，米受政治席作用，在法時，吳敬恒等對本人極愛惜，勸彼勿一幹政治，而辦中法國立工業專門學校，後即任該校校長。一二八前，蔣汪時合時分，如中山艦事變，寗漢決裂，擴大會議，非常會議等，彼均未參加。廿一年汪任行政院長，秘書長一職，曾仲鳴因欲調長鐵道部，始由彼繼任，廿二年十二月汪遇刺辭職，彼亦離去，廿五年任國大代表選舉事務所副主任（正主任爲一將作賓），廿七年曾赴漢渝，二次均爲中法學校經濟奔走，無關政治。汪與影佐·今井二人訂密的之時，彼均不知。（三）汪與維新臨時二僞組縱南京，青島二次會議，均汪自去，彼僅隨員之一，和平及組府條件，均係汪之主張，彼不過聽說而已。南京政府之成之，已在南京失守後二年四個月，在此期間，人民痛苦已極，成立政府，可使國人少受日人直接統治。汪主　渝，實因抗戰是救國的，但和平亦是救國的，彼於讀艷電後，頗疑此爲一種分工方法（蔣先生是武的汪先生文），彼曾經參加和平遝動之經過（一書送法院），汪以爲抗戰已經開始，易於維持下去，和平則不易，曾吿蔣先生曰「你做容易的，我做難的」，深信異途必有同歸之日。汪之組府，且恢復黨的組織，即表示未叛黨國，且年號，國號均同，不若維新，臨時之叧立名稱。國旗上之黃布條，亦汪來後始取去，故南京實反面抗日，間接抗日，和平抗日也。（四）彼與日訂約之後，主權土地並未因而减少，不可稱爲喪權辱國，「同盟條約」之名，已較「基本條約」在字面上好看得多，且此二的彼未副署，不負簽訂之責。中日滿共同宣言，彼亦未簽字，僞滿爲已成事實，不得不權爲忍痛一時，取得中滿關係，徐圖收回。（五）對英美宣戰，係汪以自己名義，由國府發表，未經外部，因英美與僞府未有外交關係，彼至此又稱頌中日共同防共之主張，謂卅四年五月四日取消共同防共，實日本失敗原因之主，彼自以爲對英美宣戰後，始收回租界，最近頒布之接收租界條例爲「笑話」，軸心國之承認僞府，爲事勢所趨，非彼一人耳。（六）敵佔領時期，各部曾皆得與日交涉，外交部僅送往迎來而已，事實上乃一「交際部」，彼乃於餘暇從事社會文化事業，如衛生音樂電影等。</p>
<p>自願受誅</p>
<p>繼即自詡其功績，謂彼一人曾來陵內對總理像靜默讀遺囑及獨唱黨歌。又謂，中日同文同種，同信佛敎，故彼曾修葺廟宇，並得三藏頂骸，且以高十一尺之千手觀音易得名古屋獨木雕成高三丈三尺之觀音。（七）彼使陷區人民在日人統治下仍有黨的活動，非但不負黨，亦不負國家。（八）對中支及華北二振興公司，謂係維新及臨時政府時所承認，不在彼職權之內。廣東增稅收八萬萬元，指係法院製造，供詞，比屈打成招更利害，實則彼所犯罪已足可判處死刑，請檢察官勿以莫須有之罪加彼，十三日已知陳公博判死刑，「我當然也是死刑」，但曾接主席一電，謂「彼附敵有罪，因念追隨總理革命有年，且日降後在粤維持治安，可以從輕辦理」，雖眞僞辯，但自願就死，至此，彼乃宣讀其答辯書之附敵名曰「爲一般和述同志講幾句話」略謂：目下人才缺乏，一般爲生計所逼，而在僞府工作之大小官員，要請從寬發落，彼並指摘軍統局無合法捕人之權，對逮捕彼等時，稱係用欺騙手段，又用咬文嚼字之姿態，指摘懲治漢奸條例，且就偽府擾亂金融一點稱：渝陷區人民所受痛苦，不及勝利後二百作一之烈，末謂「爲罪當誅，亦可追隨汪先生於地下，引領待罪，毫無遺憾」。此時庭上宣面具柞，五時廿五分再開庭，審判長先出款僞委任狀，粤省府會議記錄，共同聲眼，僞國府要人赴日答禮記及褚所撰之「世界大勢和東亞團結」　，交褚自閱，問：到日本去過幾次，答民國廿九年與陳公博赴日答禮，三十任爲駐駐大使，是年汪首次訪日，三十一春秋各去一次，秋間係偕汪第二次訪日，三十二往開大東亞醫學會，同年十一月五日赴日，開大東亞會議，三十三年往探汪病，大東亞會一義係汪出席，彼係列席，庭上於是開放其廣播灌音之唱片「九一八的回顧與新認識」，中有「蔣介石剛愎自用禍國殃民」及「大言炎炎欺騙民衆」等語，褚聽時極表不安稱：「聽得出是我的聲音」。問，去日本是否專辦使軸心國家承認僞府，答，是。問，是在何時承認的，答，事勢使然，非我一人之力。間，訂的是汪本人簽字，你沒有經手麼，答，商議有時亦參加。問，在粤省長任內有禁烟事吾，答，有，禁烟局直屬禁烟總監本人曾協助禁烟局特派員，在滬要求航空公司於六月間運粤三萬兩。問，辦禁烟事很好，但旣禁烟，又何必大批運去，答，公賣，問，那不是禁烟，是賣烟了，答，是，寓禁于征，且係禁烟總監之事，不由省府辦。明，電報是你同陳公博往來的，答，與省政府有關的，祗經濟方面而已。問，與松井問烟稅八萬萬元事你雖不承認，但査出卷宗中有與松井談話記錄，有一段曰，可增稅收八萬萬地獄，其半呈請中央作爲省補助費，一半補助日軍，答，有此討論，未實行。</p>
<p>首檢論告</p>
<p>於是庭上宣布調査證據完畢，韓首檢起而論吿，略謂：（一）被告自以爲救國救民，但重慶已有中央，南京之成立僞府，實係附敵老百姓之痛苦，僞府不特毫未解除，且增捐稅，暴歛橫行，老百姓痛苦有增無减。（二）和平抗戰是笑談，要「抗」就要有槍桿，何况僞府一再聲言同甘共苦，甚且欲同生共死。（三）九一八以還，國家從未承認東北已失，誓死收復，故有抗戰，　偽府乃首先訂的，承認與敵爲同盟，雖係汪簽字，而被告身任外交部長，實不能諱爲不知。（四）與英美宣戰後，雖自稱慶除治外法權，但僞法院有審過一個日人否，租界之收回，與被吿不涉。（五）被吿以還都爲功，但汪兆銘等少數漢奸還都，祇是叛國。（六）中支及華北振興公司之爲害，被吿亦知，增稅八萬萬元事，如非戰事結束，亦必已實行。（七）淪陷區人民受苦之深如此，豈可無法律之制裁，被吿謂懲治漢奸條例不能適用，實屬荒謬。（八）被吿批評法律不當，但本席祗能依法論吿，對此點無駁覆之必要。至是，庭上乃命　答辯，　略謂：抗可用口頭或書面不必用槍彼稱組織偽府甚爲困難，人才太少，故貪汚及特工之弊，確係事實。且力譽維琪政府及貝當之忍辱爲國。</p>
<p>公布辯書</p>
<p>至此，褚逆力竭聲嘶，話語支離，自稱犯了懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款，請審判長從重處彼死刑，謂無期徒刑太不經濟，末謂，對和遝始終贊成，至今不變。庭長又補充問，「中日滿」宣言，經過外交部嗎，答，外交部辦的，對英美宣戰，則未經外部。問，基本及同盟二的呢，答，外交部辦的，但我未簽字。問，宣戰文吿的原稿見過否，答發表後始見，係僞府交宣傳部發表。問，僞府計劃於戰爭後期美軍登陸時，內應國軍，此事與中央有接洽否，答，我未與重慶通消息，聽公博口頭談過，是通消息的。問，此話有根據嗎，答，是，口頭大家講好的，事實上如不內應，必受兩路夾攻。陳璧君叫我至粤，即係命維持靑黃不接時之治安。至是，蘇高院公職辯護人高溶起而代辯，略謂；勝利以前，一般人多有以爲汪逆與重慶有默契，和平與抗戰，被吿確以爲殊途同歸，其情堪憫，即云賣鴉片，亦爲寓禁於征，東北與華北之民衆，事實上亦確較南京僞府一般人民更苦，彼吿厭世求死，仍應請論罪處刑云云。最後，褚逆亦援陳逆公博之例，要求公布其答辯時，庭上准之，於即宣布本案辯論終結，定廿二日下午三時宣判，褚逆乃曰：廿二日我再要來一次了，鞠躬而退，時已七時一刻矣。</p>

<h3>過檀香山費往東京　馬歇爾兼程返華　吉倫秦德純等在瀋陽會議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社檀香山十四日電〕杜魯門總統特使馬歇爾元帥偕夫人自華府啓程，返歸中國任所，今日抵此宣稱：我等在中國不知將留住幾時，對於此行使命及　眷同行事，馬帥並不表示意見，今晚即由此間出發，取道東京赴華。</p>
<p>〔聯合社瀋陽十五日電〕軍事三人小組代表來瀋調査眞相，其使命定明日完成，即返陪都向該小組三委員報吿。據此間人士意見，國共僵局，即使馬歇爾特使返華，能吾以其高强能力出而調停，以免流血，尙不無可疑。東北方面現已有兩處激戰在進行中，雙方均有重大死傷。據政府方面消息，新一軍向四平平緩緩推進，遭共軍四萬人猛攻，瀋陽東南三十哩處，國軍第五十二軍兩師，被共軍包圍於本溪鐵礦區，現正力圖擊退共軍。今戰事已在進行，執行小組束手無策，馬歇爾定十六日到述東京，必可於數日內抵中國。馬氏現在遭遇之情勢，較彼去歲十二月開始在華謀使國共兩軍團結，共保恒久和平時，縱不更爲艱巨，亦必同樣困難，此固人盡皆知，並非秘密。三人小組代表吉倫·秦德純·陳士渠十五日與本城代表會議兩小時，然後視察工廠區。全城各處，已發現標語，大　「反對分裂東北」，「反對與匪徒談判」。</p>

<h3>「泛美節」杜魯門演說　人民欲圖幸福　必須國際合作　美國睦鄰政策基礎堅固</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十五日電〕美國全國昨日紀念泛美節，杜魯門總統向汎美同盟理事會發表演說，略謂：歷史亦將記錄在一九三九年前，羅斯福總統及其偉大之國務卿赫爾，如何努力於防止戰爭，並向世界其餘各處傳佈此種睦鄰政策，渠曾被軸心獨裁者與侵略者之瘋狂及征服世界之夢想所阻，但當聯合國向納粹法西斯作戰之時，美國即開始對全世界奠定睦鄰之政策。諸君亦知睦鄰政策之基礎，如何堅固，聯合國以此等基礎爲根據，現已發動共事業，余深知聯合國的事業將成功，而且必然成功·在吾人之前，現有一新時代，在此新時代中，原子能之力量，已知猛虎出押，在此一時代內，非究全破壞，即全世界人勞力將減輕而生活標準將提高。爲維持永久和平計，世界人民現已顯示於必要時願意使用武力以阻止侵略或侵略之威脅，五口人均明瞭此種武力之存在，雖或可使侵略不敢猖獗，但本身決不能消滅不安之原因，如第二次世界大戰之起因，在納粹瘋狂之下面爲由於貧窮與絕望所產生之物質困難與精紳飢餓，除非此等構成戰爭原因之經濟病症完全消失，吾則戰爭之危險決不能完全消除，職是之故，吾人必須達到一種物質，文化與精神之生活，此種生活，凡屬世界人民，均有享受之權利，吾人必須以精力與資源，貢獻於此一目標，包含此一目標者，除「民主」二字外，余不知叧有其他字眼。民主主義者爲今日各處自由人爭取較善生活之口號，吾人均感覺「民主」二字在各種不同之文字中，具有各種不同之意義，世界各處對此一詞、均將有不同之註解，但我訊美國家對此「民主」二字，則具有一種共同基本之知解，是亦幸也。</p>
<p>自由首需某種政治權利，此即言論出版集會之自由良心之自由，及人民有選舉彼等政府形式之權利。此種目標，顯有恃手各國自身之努力，然若吾人自過去十年中獲得任何敎訓，當知無一國能孑然獨存，唯有藉眞正之合作，全世界始有獲致此種目標之可能。彼等需要國際戰力合作，共謀擴大生產，增加世界貿易，發展火然富源，庶幾一切增進生活水準之努力，始克奠立於穩固之基礎上，過去引導汎美工作之原則，實已含有此種合作精神。吾人必須於來日，令此等原則見諸實際行動，及生具體效果。</p>

<h3>再論上海屋荒問題</h3>
<p>上海屋荒問題，本報昨日因行政院最近頒布分配各機關房屋辦法，有所論列，實則其所論及之範圍祗在硏討行政院規定辦法之是否可取，而尙未能根究屋荒問題畢竟如何方可期其解決，意猶未盡，不得不更爲申論。</p>
<p>昨晚本報連得讀者來函兩通，都對此屋荒問題發表主張，其一乃對行政院辦法提供補充意見、其二乃對此問題就政府立法方面有所貢獻。我們在這裏先將此兩函摘錄大意，然後再說明我們的看法。</p>
<p>（一）謝雲翼君來函，大意謂：「行政院辦法之規定，無疑地爲解決本市房屋問題的正當途徑。但辦法在實施上如有未盡妥洽，應予改善，總以國家利益人民利益雙方兼顧爲上。故此項辦法，宜有補充：第一，本法律不追旣往的原則，爲維護人民的利益，應規定本辦法公布前確已依法訂有租的之住戶，經房屋委員會審核無舞弊情事後，仍得視爲有效。第二，除已訂有合法租的者外，非敵僞所有房屋歸中央信託局統一承租。至於中央信託局所統一出租之房屋，如何申請，如何審核，如何分配，似亦應有明白規定，隨時公布，以昭大信。總之，關於目前上海住屋問題，政府與人民交感其困。人民對政府爲應復員亟需而有的緊急措施，固應瞭解擁護，政府對於人民利益亦應曲加維護。政府權力固應强調，人民自由亦應尊重。須於國計民生兼籌並顧，纔是解決上海住屋問題的正當途徑。」</p>
<p>（二）章鄂棠君來函，略謂：「上海房屋供不應求的原因，在政府的立法方面也要詳細探討一下。民國三十二年十二月十三日政府公布的戰時房屋租賃條例，原爲適應戰時需要，不得不有非常措置，立法精神不妨從嚴，無可厚非。但於三十五年三月十八日，上海市政府修正公布之房屋租貸管理規則及上海市房屋租金標準兩種法規，對於出租人所定的租金與其他取費的限制，就當前社會情况而言，不無可供討論之處。依照該兩種法規，關於租金一項主要的規定，計有（一）出租人除租金外，不得向承租人收取頂費及小租，違反者承租人得向法院訴請返還之。（二）房屋租金額，在民國二十六年八月十三日前有約定者，營業用屋應以六十倍，居住用屋應以四十倍爲計算標準，在二十六年八月十三日以後者，其租金額應依前項同樣建築地段，估定價値，比例計算。現在此項標準已於日前經市府會議改爲一百八十倍與一百四十倍，確已較前公允。但按照目前物價開支，出租人倘恃房租收入爲生者，勢必仍感艱困。如向承租人要求調整加租，必以法令規定爲規定，拒絕不理。大房東因爲無利可圖，勢必寗願將房屋空閒起來，不欲租給別人，或不願投炎於建築房屋之途。再照房屋租賃管理規則第十一條第五項所定，承租人分租房屋，其所取租金超過原租金之比例百分之三十者，大房東得終止其契的。如此更使二房東不願將空屋轉租於人。譬如二房東將每月租金一千元之房屋分租他人，其收取的租金，至多不得超過三百元，目前祗就二房東所負祖的水電保證金一項而論，普通動須繳納一二萬元，雖將來可以取回，等於白耗利息，而其他房屋修理費用，現在大多也由二房東承當，尙不計算在內。二房東因爲所得的利潤限制過嚴，得不償失，除非自討麻煩，才會將房屋分租他人，以致目前二房東多情願關門獨住，樂得寬敞舒服。戰前招租條子滿街都是，敵僞時期也因訂有此項收取租金不得超過百分之幾的規定註在轉租執照之內，招租條子就漸漸的少了，於今簡直不大看見。在此百物指數較諸戰前所漲何止千倍萬倍，皆無法制裁，惟獨對於租金一項，强使不准提高，如此畸形不合理的現狀，祗能作爲片面壓制租金的上漲，而其實反足加車房荒的程度。管見所及，以爲（一）頂費小租，跡近不當利得，必須嚴予制止，出租人如有違反，不獨可向法院訴請返還，公家並應從重科以罰金。（二）租金應仍依照民法，由雙方合意訂定爲原則。至多祗能限制大房東出租房屋每月所收之租金，不得超過原建築物估價數額千分之幾，二房東轉租房屋每月所收之租金，不得超過原租金總額以上，如因情勢變更，得以雙方之合意增减之，或聲請房屋管理委員會調解。如此，則大房東出租房屋索取的租金，不致漫無標準，二房東分租房屋，除去不能與承租人分担之損失外，亦可稍沾利潤，庶可免除閉屋不租之弊。（三）在房屋租賃管理規則第九條，得爲終止租賃各款之內，應增加一款，如「承租人租賃房屋之後而無需用必要者。」因爲且前滬地租金過於低廉，居戶頗有貪圖自便，或備爲旅遊之所，或人口元多，佔住廣大部份，或寗月出租金，閉置不用。類此情形，爲數當不在少。常茲房屋求過於供的時候，必須嚴訂法令，杜絕承租人損人利己的囤積房屋行爲。」</p>
<p>以上所引兩位讀者的意見，都可認爲平心靜氣的討論，自具相當理由。我們相信當局從全局着眼，果有可取，亦必可望酌量採納。於此，我們願再補充幾點意見：</p>
<p>首先，我們以爲行政院所定中央信託局統一承祖的辦法，不獨可適用於非敵偽所有之一般民有房產，且宜酌量適用於敵偽所有之房屋。因爲，我們如果眞要解決屋荒問題，就得從這個主題上着眼，房屋開放愈多愈好，似不宜同時另爲國庫躉筆收入設想。倘祗如原辦法所定，「敵僑居住房屋屬於敵偽所有者，一律受蘇浙皖區敵僞產業處理局接收出售，「則此大宗房屋必爲少數富商大買所各自獨佔，而未必能普徧分租於公務員與一般市民。况於無形中使人民感覺，政府接收之敵僞房產只顧出售，而不租與各機關與公務員住用，却反强制民產由中央信託局統一承租，似非事理之平。天下事的處理，量宜求其公平，不平則鳴，亦自然之理。故政府爲表示解決房荒的眞誠計，對政府今後所能掌有的房產，如何統籌出租尤宜率先作一榜樣。而况一律出售的辦法，事實上是否全有此種受主。願向政府標買高價的房產，在此時也似大有問題。政府一時的躉筆收入未必有把握，而反須於米曾出售之前，先行强制原住此項敵偽房產之住戶限期遷出，重使他們必須更與其他市民爭　他種房屋，以增加房屋恐慌的程度亦似未爲得計。</p>
<p>其次，信託局統一承租民有房屋，宜視爲辦法的原則，而不可不於合理範圍內容許其例外。此所謂例外，並非叧開方便之門，而爲尊重原業主的合法權益與各機關或公務員的合法租賃計，不能不如此。例如：戰前業主確係自用的房屋，實有鄰居戶籍可查，而因戰事被敵僞强佔强租者，今業主或自遠方回滬，或自浜南遷回虹口江灣一帶，仍須自用，而能覓有殷實保證者，無論言情言理言法，均宜許其自用，免予統一承租。再如業主在此次七項辦法未頒布前，確已與各正常機關或復員公務人員訂立合法租的者，則就政府統一承租的原意來說，未可認爲相背。業主旣非會岡不法立得的頂費小租之類，而其房客又即爲政府所必須配給房屋之對象，則政府又何必不怕麻煩」重來一次「統一承租」的手續。諸如此類，我們希望負責的委員會和中央信託局應該愼重考慮。至於謝君所舉本法律不追旣往的原則，承認以前一切已訂租約爲有效，在理論上固亦可通，但應注意的是：這些已訂租約是否約無上下其手倒填年月的事實？聽說最近虹口施高塔路某大里衖的房屋，在敵僑騰空的時候，就由業主某地產公司於一夜之間，化整爲零，變了　數的業主，每幢房屋均變爲業主自用，而實則各由該地產公司收取鉅額頂費小租，分別訂的出租。此種行徑，自將爲後方復員的窮公務員所不能忍受！</p>
<p>最後，我們願再論及房租數額問題。章君以爲租金限制過低，阻礙新屋的建築，這固有一部分理由。但如謂准許租金提高，即可滿足房東的欲望，而鼓勵其建屋的興趣，此時却也未必。須知目前市場暗息常在一角以上，試問房租縱高，是否可以高到如此？假使照物料工資的成本估計，單幢樓房需費一千萬元，每月究能規定租金一百萬元否？就算政府不予限制，完全放任，試問有那等普通市民可以租住此種單幢樓房？老實說，在今天這樣畸形市場，利息沒有恢復正常以前，建築屋舍以樂民居的大事，除了政府負起責任來幹，恐怕沒有私人願意來投資的！而且，提高租金可以容許依照成本估價酌定比例，這辦法也祗能對新建房屋適用。至若建築已久之房屋，縱可承認其酌量提高，也依理不容許其照此計租，因爲以前建築時之價値究屬低微，現在經過大戰，房屋猶存，即不啻爲其當時付出的造價已保存其幣値，若更依此增値計算利息而定其租額，則租額必高至驚人，而此種業主的過分利得，實無非爲一般窮人血汗的敲剝。我們承認大房東在此時多不合算，但請他們打一大算盤，總算經過八年血戰，還得保存房屋，等於保存幣値，千幸萬幸。所應爲他們要求者，即此時房產轉讓或租賃不當迫其繳納過鉅的稅款，使房地產的買賣可以流通。我們同時承認二房東不上定全是壞的，三房客也不一定全是被欺的，但無論如何，二房東「租田當自產」，租了房屋可以索價出頂，業出反無權過問，這終究是今後業主興趣索然之主因。故今天就房屋問題硏究，還得先用政治的力量，在法律範圍內以全力保障業主的主權，而提高租額猶在其次。</p>

<h3>電費增收附加費　每度增收廿六元　公用局主管人員說明理由</h3>
<p>本市電價附加費，自四月十六日起，每度增收二十六元。茲據公用局主管人員稱：本市電價，向依煤價爲凖，本市電廠用煤，係由政府配給，故電價亦較國內各大都市爲廉。例如重慶小戶電燈價格每度一百五十元，南京一百四十元，但煤價因煤鑛成本增高，一月份煤價增爲每噸二萬三千餘元，本市電價未予增加。三月份煤價又改爲二萬九千餘元，雖較市價爲廉，但各公司方面，收支不能相抵，虧損日增。上海電力公司，每月須虧八億元，法商電燈公司，月虧一億四千萬元，華商三電氣公司，亦月虧一億三千萬元。故考量實際情形，依照經濟部核准之增加附加費辦法，將各級用電每度加收煤斤附加費二十六元，即小用戶每度電費由二十四元增至五十元，以資維持公司業務。如煤斤供應充沛，煤價低落，仍須遞降。再本市各公司發電量爲機量所限，已感不足，深盼市民能竭力節約用電。</p>

<p>烚赤昨上塲尙穩，中行對同業登記二七〇條，如數以一六〇之之價配給，近午稍形疲軟，一般心理對美鈔雖咸看高，對黃金則認爲套頭勢必軋攏至六〇〇元對十兩，以致重鈔輕金之觀念復高，晨開一六〇萬，開後一度供過於求，退至一五七萬五，美鈔步昂，助長買風氣而後重振，中行配給時最高達一六二萬五，十一時後持有者陸續脫手，午刻在一五八萬左右徘徊，中行壓力頻仍，籌碼見鬆，午後回跌至一五三萬五，結果較上週</p>

<p>外幣美鈔在紗花帮猛力結款下·有粥少僧多之象，零星之買戶仍在浮言助威中，爭先扒結，是以晨初一度退入二千元大關，不旋踵即步步趨漲，午刻升至二一二〇元而後稍呈盤旋，漲勢旣遭挫折，多方略有出　，金市亦跌，午後降至二〇五〇元左右，結果與上週六相彷彿，港票初堅後平，結果老貨微升，美匯外商銀行二〇四〇稍有結出，港電羅比仍平。</p>

<h3>華股漲力不足　川帮猛購怡紗</h3>
<p>昨日市上頻傳華股抽稅流言，持有者有所了結，以致多方雖盡力支持，漲勢終覺乏勁，十時後因當局巡査紗布大樓，交易中途停頓，此際均呈低價，永紗四八五〇元，美亞三九〇〇元，景福四〇八元，十一時後恢復賣買，各股回好半成結束，榮豊因業中大戶開始吃敲，擠入熱門，喊價扳高，冷門各股形勢稍定，元老股仍形冷落，午收結果較上週六計永紗景福微挫，美亞新光勤興則稍升，榮豊漲起一成弱，午後隔日預做，略有脫金換股者，市價均稍扳高，永紗五二〇〇元，美亞四三〇〇元，景福四四〇元，新光三五〇元，勤興二八〇元外股昨以川帮加入，猛購怡紗萬股，證券帮逢高脫售，衆業公所復業，已得某大員默許之訊，人心尙挺，惟因操業者亦有出籠，過租雖堅而多盤，午收結果較上週六略見上漲，午後怡紗英聯平平，僅鋼業續見喊高在四三〇〇元以上。</p>
<h3>白煤市况呆平　烟煤交易漸活動</h3>
<p>煤市跌勢漸見緩和，市况亦趨平定，價與上週末相仿，烟煤實貨流出，較前爲旺，然去路亦不弱，交易漸趨活動，白煤市價連日下跌，人心仍屬覜望，進戶亦僅以實銷量爲限，然市價與上月底高價相比，已跌去五成，辦貨者莫不明苦連天，咸不忍再以低價斬割，故市呈呆平狀態。</p>
<h3>燒碱漲價　派貸希望甚缺</h3>
<p>燒碱昨因本市廠戶有實用，及漢口帮採辦進胃濃厚，故價即上漲，月牌每桶三十三萬元，美貨每桶二十八萬元，據某洋行消息，燒碱無派貨希望，所以該貨可能再好，其他原料因亦轉堅。</p>

<h3>北大復校後　將增設農學院</h3>
<p>〔大華社重慶訊〕關於北京大學復校後，增設農學院事，據此間敎育界訊，敎育部原定方針，係將北大改設六院，除原有之文理法三院外，另外增設農工醫三學院。惟北大校方意見，其農學院之增設，殆已不成問題，刻已着手勘察羅道莊農學院原址。現在臨大第四分班之校舍，則將歸還朝陽學院。工學院之歸屬，現尙未定，臺北大經費許可，或將增設，若不可能，則或將併入淸華工學院。至於醫學院，布北大方面則無意設院，因按之北大系統，畢業校友中，並無醫科出身者。組之，此事最後決定，尙須取決於敎部與北大校友之磋商。</p>

<h3>貧窮·饑餓·災荒·疫癘　江西在災厄線上　人民喧騰着一片要求活下雲的慘叫聲</h3>
<p>— 四月一日南昌通訊　李國華寄</p>
<p>戰事結束已半年了，江西境內的敵人大部份都遣送出境，可是這慘遭寇軍蹂躪七年的豫草平原，今天却又面對着另一個更可怕的敵人，這便是整個省區普遍的貧困，飢餓，災荒與疫癘的遊行</p>
<p>糧價猛漲　六旬老婦啖菜根</p>
<p>以南昌市來作個例吧：自從勝利以來，物價一直向上跳躍，尤其是糧價一馬富先，六個月來，整整地翻了二十倍，由一千二百元一石的自米，到今天已突破二萬五千元的大關，黑市竟叫價到三萬，現在仍在姚還在漲！原在淪陷區的老百姓和流離轉徙的義民飽受敵寇的壓榨和掠奪，甕中已經沒有了半點餘糧，禦寒的破棉棉衣也尋不出一件，蜷伏在那斷垣殘壁間的敗草中遭受春寒風雨的侵凌！那裏還有錢買一升半合米來充飢？只有挖掘樹根草皮煮食苟延殘餘的生命。廢曆殘冬時分，省會冬令救濟會發放賑米，有一組在市區鳳凰坡一帶放賑，便碰見鳳凰坡七號破屋裏的一週六十多歲的老太婆劉趙氏正在那裏煮樹根吃。放賑的人當即嚐嚐那切成一片片水煮樹根的滋味，，味淡根硬，實在難以下咽，吃後味更苦澀，腹內十分難受！可是在南昌市便有兩萬左右的赤貧無靠者，以這苦澀生硬難以下咽的樹根做他們延長生命的食糧！</p>
<p>一切完了　春荒緊隨在後面</p>
<p>南昌還是江西的大城市！其他受災各縣的情况如何呢？例如贛化的高安，德安，奉新，上高，戰前原都是富庶的縣份，現在往往數十星沒有人烟，田地荒蕪達三四百萬畝，農村中的耕牛都殺光了，唯一留下作種子的稻穀也被去秋敵人潰退時搶光了，一批一批的難民回到殘破的家園，沒有吃，沒有住，望着雜草叢生的荒墟，耕牛，犁耙，種籽都光了，怎樣去開荒？怎樣去耕種？同時疫癘便乘隙襲入這飢餓苦難之羣，攝去他們殘餘的生命！</p>
<p>贛西萍鄕一帶，七年的大病還沒有稍愈，去歲又遭受到幾十年來罕見的旱災，早稻粒穀沒有收，晚稻的收穫全縣平均起來還不到三成。萍鄉一帶本來就是缺糧的縣份，就是全縣豐收每年也還得差三個月的糧食，何况寇災和天災接二運本地來侵襲，贛西的老百姓又如何經受得起如此的摧殘！從目前的情况來看，今年嚴重的春荒恐怕又將繼着旱魃來臨！</p>
<p>由於客歲春夏粤境敵軍沿着贛江兩岸潰退，贛南贛中各縣更吃了一個大虧，特別是粤贛邊境的三南，敵人在那裏實行有計劃的燒，殺，搜括政策，帶不走的便全部燒毁，耕牛家畜被殺得精光，連池塘裏的魚也給放石灰淹死，，贛江兩岸如萬安，泰和，吉安，吉水縣屬的大市集三曲灘，峽江，新淦，樟樹，豐城，市汶，所有城鎭，被毁都極慘烈，尤以萬安，峽江二縣城內只剩了幾棟房子，遍野都是人屍牛蹄，豐城以下到南昌一帶，兩岸民房也毀去什九，市汶完全被燒得精光，災情的慘重，由此可見。</p>
<p>鼠疫黑手　從贛東仲展過來</p>
<p>經過民國三十一年的浙贛綫戰事，贛東各縣，。備受敵寇的蹂躪摧殘。近兩年來，當地的原氣尙未恢復，但是比戰爭還可怕的鼠疫却在這一帶悄悄地蔓延開來，這種足以殺人千于萬的黑死病，在前年冬天已由光澤傳到了南城。據說病疫最流行的時候，死者連棺材都買不着，有些患病的人家甚至全家同歸於盡。</p>
<p>病魔和疫菌向來便是戰神的隨伴，大兵之後，贛東的鼠疫自然更加速它蔓延的速度，追噬着貧困的人民，因此，去年十月間南城鼠疫復熾，比去年初夏更加猖獗，疫區已經擴展到四鄉六七十里以外，同時還發現肺鼠疫和腦膜炎鼠疫兩種病例，據中正醫學院劉南山敎授談：這兩種鼠疫，均藉空氣傳染，蔓延的速率和死亡率的高度超赤一般鼠疫一倍以上。如南城某戶因患鼠疫面死，前　弔　的戚友都被傳染，回家使吿身亡，後來連扛抬死者棺材的扛伕也被傳染到。又有該　株良鄕的某鄕紳，以爲鼠疫是魔鬼作崇，於是打　　魔，但不到幾天，株良鄕便被鼠疫波及，患者有九十九人之多，像這一類的駭人聽聞的鼠疫猖獗的故事，在圍城已成爲非常普通的事情人。</p>
<p>今春，鼠疫的黑手又伸進了南豐了！第一次發現是在縣北門外柳樹下一號的住戶裏，首先發現死鼠兩　，後有鄕下親戚帶來一個一歲的男孩和十歲的女孩來作客，男孩突然患病，兩天之后便死了。女孩在男孩起病後一天得病，兩天之后也不治而死。症狀都是滿身發黑，流淚，有涕無嗽。接着北門外城下一號住戶婦人袁胡氏，也突發高熱，頭痛，眼膜充血，神昏倦怠，當晚由南豐衛生院院長和江西防疫第三隊隊長治療，次日上午便發現左右側鼠蹊部淋巴腺都發腫，面色靑紫，晚來咳嗽作吐即死，死後床下發現死鼠一頭。據這婦人的近鄰談：在死者患病的前一天，曾看見死鼠四頭，並有一頭白天外出吸水，即行死去。這樣一直到本月初，病者雖然還未繼續發現，每天却都有有死鼠，而且已蔓延到城內中華東路一帶。</p>
<p>傳染疾病　有處處業生之虞</p>
<p>南城。南豐諸縣在地理上是贛東的中心，亦爲閩贛毘連地區的重鎮，南城北距南昌只有一百六十裏面，戰后贛東南一帶的贛北以及他省的難胞，都經過這裏返鄕，假使不嚴加防範，鼠疫將由難民的移動傳至各地，所以這種疫癘的蔓延，已經不僅僅是江西一隅的嚴重問題了！</p>
<p>除了可怕的鼠疫以外，其他各種流行的傳染病到處業生。今春雩都一個重要市鉅銀坑發生腦膜炎，不到一個月，便死去了五十多個鄉民，接着興國·永修·以及南昌附近史村和市區也有發現。最近，麻疹天花的流行，在南昌·九江可說是打破歷年來的紀錄。疫癘如此猖獗，這當然是戰爭所埋下的種子。敵人隨處屠殺人民和牲畜，腐爛的屍體正是病菌最好的寄生母體。加以客冬奇暖，直到現在還從來沒有下過一次大雪，這種反常的氣候，更成爲今年病菌滋生的溫床。據醫生談：今年夏季，江西的流行傳染病，必然比較　年要更嚴重得多！</p>
<p>吃的沒有　那裏面還會有餘糧</p>
<p>「戰災慘重！「物價上漲！」「病疫流行！」這種新聞，近三個月來，差不多每天都在江西的新聞紙上佔了相當的篇幅，而各縣中的民意機關代表呼籲當局救濟的報道，更是連篇累牘。</p>
<p>記者每遇見這些來自災區各縣的父老，他們多垂淚而道：「耕牛沒有！種籽沒有！連耕地的傢伙都完了！回去齣人，大家都望着）片廢墟發呆，吃的都沒有，還要徵購餘糧，唉！叫老百姓怎麽去活？」</p>
<p>有一次，見到一個峽江縣的紳士，他說：「峽江經過敵人的竄擾，人口只剩三萬多了，可是征購餘糧的數額却分配到十萬石之多，照目前的人數，連吃乳的要見包括在內，每個人平均要出三担糧，其實我們連自己吃的都沒有，那裏還有餘糧！」</p>
<p>攤派繁重　疋吏催繳如火急</p>
<p>除了兩百萬租巨額的餘糧壓在嗷嗷待哺的江西老百姓肩上以外，赤貧的人民身上，還有一條條吸血蟲在吮血，這些吸血蟲便是那些不肖的地方汚吏。記得月前劉文島先生代表中央來贛宣慰人民，訪問南昌近郊鄕鎮走進一個小飯店時，櫃台裏坐了一位中年婦女，抱着一個還未斷乳的要兒，劉氏寒暄幾句，即詢及生活情形，據吿：「我的家被日軍燒光了，現在化了二担榖一月的租金，租下了這個小舖直，每天的生意，只有一千元上下。」她接着說：「糊口眞不容易，同時攤派繁多，催繳火急，我們來此一月，保甲上就攤派了三千多元。」劉氏忙問：是些什麼捐？」她說：「我們每月每人不論大小要出三升米和一百元，過陽曆年的時候，每家亦派了二百元，還有什麼修路費呀，淸潔捐啊，就是我們這個剛滿一週的小孩子，亦要派工修路，不能做，只好花錢雇工，像我們開飯店的，每月還要出被服十天，我一家四口，才一床被，那裏有辦法傘出去呢？沒辦法，就要化五十元一夜的租金，租了被子送的去。」劉氏問：「攤派捐款有收條嗎？」他搖了搖頭，說「從來沒有」。劉氏又問：「這些捐款做什麽用的」，她連說「不知道」。</p>
<p>這還是距離省府所在地南昌不到二十里地的農村！</p>

<p>語言</p>
<h3>用世界語言促進和平</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>世界人種複雜，語言繁多。由甲國國境跨入乙國時，語言隔閡便滋生；各種事務常須假手通譯，這是很不便利的。尤其是在原子時代伊始之際，國際的界綫已臻消除，所以，一種共通的世界語是必要的。如果有了一種共通的世界語言，則走遍天下也不會遭遇到語言的困難而產生各種隔膜了。推而廣之的說：語言相通，天下可成一家，世界和平亦必能更趨鞏固，殘酷的原子戰爭也必可消滅於無形。</p>
<p>羅斯福夫人於一月廿六日在倫敦某劇院發表演說稱：「擬在聯合國機構提議，世界各地學校應強迫教授一種國際間通用之語文。語言隔膜最足以妨害世界和平，故希望聯合國機構能規定，全世界兒童，除本國文必須學習外，並應另外學習一種世界語。」</p>
<p>她認爲「全世界兒童除本國文必須學習外，並應另外學習一種世界語。」這是極爲警關的話語，如果全世界有了一種共通的語言則足以妨害和平的「語言的隔膜」就能袪除殆盡，不過，現在問題是究竟學習什麼一種「世界語」？在歷來的習慣上，外交的語言是法文，甚至一切條文本發生爭執都是以法文爲根據；而在世界上應用較廣的則是英文，但是這二種語言都僅能稱是「外交語言」及「國際通商語言」，而非普遍的純粹的「世界語」。羅斯福夫人的所謂「世界語」，並沒有明確的指出，我以爲如果全世界的兒童必須學習一種世界語以應付時代需要的話，那麼，學習英語或法語都不足以稱爲「世界語」，因爲這二種語言還是有它的範圍的，而且，以英語而法語舉之爲「世界語」。那是不妥當的，因爲這二種語言還是有「國家性」的，而不是「國際性」（世界性）的，所以，是不能採用作爲世界通用的語言的。</p>
<p>語言學家柴門霍夫氏曾在卅年前就攷閱到了世界共通性語言的問題，促進人類文化，免除語言隔膜。經過了他的苦思研究終於發明了一種「世界語」（Esparato），這種「世界語」溶合了各國語言的長處，並有拚讀的字母，以及母音，子音，單字，文法，作文，……無不簡便易習，並且不含一些國家語言的偏狹性在內。但是，數十年來不被重視，以致推行不廣，直到如今，還是沒有多大的建樹，這是非常可惜的事。</p>
<p>當然，柴氏的「世界語」或許也非完善的「世界語」但無疑的，今天的世界是需要一種「世界語言」以促進人類和平，免除「第三度犧牲」（羅夫人語）最迫切的時機。我們希望聯合國機構討論「世界和平」的時候，不要忽略了「世界語言」，因爲「世界語」是可能作爲「世界和平」的橋樑的。</p>

<h3>從蕭炳章的死說起</h3>
<p>— 江昭然</p>
<p>贛省府委員蕭炳章氏死了！</p>
<p>他足足病了三個月，其間祇請過兩位診費較廉的醫師療治，診費是他夫人變賣衣物的代價。後來病勢日見好轉，醫師囑以多進補品，但因財力所限，無法如願，便與世長辭了！臨死，他對他夫人說：「現在家裏沒有錢，我亦不需要禱衣棺木，你儘可用草席將我包出去，隨便葬在那兒都可以」。死後，省府常派人赴他家治喪，並撥治喪費二百萬元。出殯之日，舉行公祭，省會各界首長，俱經躬與。</p>
<p>這些事，總擺來說是：蕭委員生前極備清苦，死後備極哀榮</p>
<p>蕭委員從事革命垂四十年，廉潔不茍，死後備極哀榮，誠然理所應得；但生前備極清苦，不能說不是遺憾。試想：假使他生前不「無年無日，不爲食住担憂」，何至積憂成疾。疾而日見好轉，得以遵照醫師之囑多進補品，何至康復無望？康復以後，即令再活一個極短的時期，但他素來愛時光若生命，又該爲國爲民做多少事呢？因此，他生前備極清苦，不能說不是遺憾；而死後備極哀榮，也就不能說不是諷刺了！</p>
<p>蕭委員是「好公務員」！現社會裏「壞公務員」問題很多，像蕭委員一樣的「好公務員」亦復不少；蕭委員死了，已無法挽救，對於未死的像蕭委員一樣的「好公務員」，我以爲將來死了固要待之以理，目前在生也要待之以理，爲「澄清吏治」應該如此，為養成「人生以服務爲目的」的風氣也應該如此！</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>無廉之心</h3>
<p>— 無笑</p>
<p>每晚自西藏路回來，總見到國際飯店屋頂的「禮，義，廉，恥」四個紅字；正因爲牠們是在高高的，所以雖然還在老遠的地方，也早已經見到了。這樣直到自己蜇入漢口路以後，才不再見着牠們。</p>
<p>最近，不知怎樣，那「廉」字的霓虹管，竟壞了裏面的「兼」，祇剩了「廉」字的外壳「产」還能夠發亮。當我第一次發現這變了的「廉」字，我以爲這只是暫時的壞掉罷了，一定會有人將牠重復修好的，但在第二天晚上所見到的，仍舊是「禮，義，恥，」和只亮半個外壳的「廉」字。</p>
<p>第三天，第四天，……直到我今天寫這篇文章以前的一刻鐘，這壞了的「廉」字，好像依然沒有給人注意到過一樣；我感到有一點莫名的悵惘。</p>
<p>如果國際屋頂起始就只有「禮，義，恥，」三個字，那麼行人早就知道牠是沒有「廉」的；或者整個「廉」字都壞了，那麼我們也可以見到現在已經沒有「廉」了！可惜偏有半個「廉」的外殼，而沒有了「廉」的內心。</p>

<h3>中國的友人—端納</h3>
<p>— 鍾佐禎</p>
<p>「他真是一個不平凡的人，」名作家約翰肯色這樣說。的確，端納先生是隻手轉捩了中國歷史的偉大人物，他那深刻的文字喚醒了國人；在公元一九三六年十二月的西安事變中，他感化了少帥張學良，安全地拯救　蔣委員長，而完成全國的統一。</p>
<p>在　委員長的日記中有這樣一段：「人們都以爲端納先生是政府特聘的顧問，其實，他完全以友人的資格來協助中國，他曾幾次拒絕了最榮譽的名位。」</p>
<p>端納先生的個性率直無僞，憎惡詐騙，他自從一九〇二年離開了他的祖國澳洲後，一直在中國工作着，他因鍾愛着中國，希望它能復興，不惜屢次的奔波，所以他和馬歇爾將軍同被稱為偉大的「媒人」（Go-between）。</p>
<p>他年青時，對於騎射釣魚等都很精，尤其是騎術，最為北方善騎的國人欽佩，高爾夫更占他日常消遣的大部時間。</p>

<h3>The Situation in Changchun is Extremely Tense; Communist Troops Attack the City from Multiple Directions; Nationalist Troops Moving Northward Stationed in Siping Street</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch on the 15th] The situation in Changchun has become extremely tense. This morning, the Air Force received a telegram from Changchun stating that the Air Force ground personnel at Changchun Airport lost contact with personnel in the city from the morning of the 15th. It is possible that the airport has been captured by Communist troops. Nationalist troops moving north from Shenyang have now reached the vicinity of Siping Street, and Communist troops are attempting to prevent the Nationalist troops from advancing north. Siping Street is approximately sixty-odd kilometers north of Changchun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10:00 AM, 15th] Changchun is currently under heavy siege by Communist troops. Fighting has continued unabated throughout the night, with the sounds of gunfire as dense as a string of pearls. Communist troops have attacked the city from multiple directions, and the situation is extremely critical. The reporter's telegraphic work has been hampered. All sides are eagerly awaiting reinforcements.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] According to reports, the advance troops of the Nationalist forces moving north to take over defense entered Siping Street at 10:00 AM on the 15th. Communist troops in both the old Siping Street and Bamian City fled northwards in disarray. Furthermore, according to sources in the transportation sector, the Yujin section of the railway, which was damaged, has not been open to traffic for over a week. Recently, under the protection of Nationalist troops, engineering teams have worked day and night to complete repairs, and the line can be opened to traffic on the 15th. Passenger trains will also resume service.</p>
<p>[United Press, Changchun, 15th] The battle for Changchun is already underway. After Communist troops occupied three airfields outside the city, they have pressed closer to the urban area. Nationalist defense commander Major General Chen Jiazhen is currently retaining his main force to defend the central district. This area is densely fortified with long trenches, barbed wire, obstacles, and gun emplacements constructed from earth and stone. The Nationalist headquarters is located in the Central Bank Building. Many other buildings are also piled high with sandbags. Communist troops are currently attacking the train station from the north. A Nationalist armored train is traveling back and forth, firing at the Communist troops. The weapons being used in the fighting include rifles, machine guns, direct-fire cannons, hand grenades, and mortars. The Communist forces also have artillery to assist in the battle. It is reported that the Communist troops are commanded by generals from the New Fourth Army, utilizing Japanese weapons in their combat. The Nationalist side believes that these Japanese weapons were transferred to the Communist troops by the Soviet army several months ago.</p>
<h3>The Trial of the Traitor Chu Minyi Has Concluded; Sentencing on the Afternoon of the 22nd; After Several Hours of Defense, He Voluntarily Chooses Death</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court convened the trial of Chu Minyi on the afternoon of the 15th at 2:25 PM, with Court President Sun Hong still serving as the presiding judge, Criminal Court President Shi Meiyu as the chief judge, and Judge Lu Jiarui also present. The chief prosecutor was Han Jun, and the clerk was Qin Dali. The traitor Chu was escorted to the court at 2:20 PM in the horse-drawn carriage he has always advocated in his life. After questioning his age and place of origin, Chu read aloud his lengthy and tedious defense statement for nearly three hours. At 5:05 PM, the court adjourned for a ten-minute recess. After questioning, it was announced that the investigation of evidence was completed. Chief Prosecutor Han Jun rose to make his prosecution speech, followed by a debate between Chu and Gao Rong, the public defender of the High Court. At 7:15 PM, the court announced the conclusion of the debate, and the sentencing was scheduled for 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month. Chu was then escorted back to prison. On the 15th, the spectator seats in the courtroom were still extremely crowded, no less than during the trial of Chen Gongbo. A total of 385 spectator passes were issued, but the number of spectators exceeded this by far, and those who arrived late had almost no place to stand. At the opening of the court, Clerk Qin stood up and announced: "Today, we are hearing the case of the traitor Chu Minyi." When the court asked about his age and place of origin, the traitor Chu stated that he was 64 years old, from Wuxing, Zhejiang. He had been away from his hometown for many years and resided at 21 Xikang Road, Nanjing. When the court asked about his occupation, he replied: "I came from a scholarly background and studied in France and Japan, earning a doctorate in medicine. After returning to China, I served as a professor at Guangdong University, and as president in the 14th year of the Republic. In the 15th year of the Republic, during the Northern Expedition, I served as the Director of Logistics for the Revolutionary Army. Before the Incident, I was engaged in education, medicine, and party affairs. My family includes [blank character] and three sons and two daughters." When the court asked about his property, he replied: "It is very regrettable, I only have a house at 34 Yihe Road, Nanjing, which was built before the war. I have no property in Shanghai."</p>
<p>The Prosecutor's Accusations</p>
<p>Then, Han announced the prosecutor's accusations, stating in brief: "The defendant joined the Nationalist Party very early and held important positions such as Central Executive Committee member and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. However, in the 27th year of the Republic, when the traitor Wang Zhaoming conspired with Japanese bandits for peace talks, he traveled between Nanjing and Shanghai, conspiring with them. He conspired with the Maintenance and Provisional puppet organizations to form a puppet government, which was finally established in March of the 29th year. Wang served as the puppet chairman and concurrently the president of the Executive Yuan, with the defendant assisting him, also serving as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He accompanied the traitor Chen Gongbo to Japan to express gratitude, and also signed the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty with the Japanese and issued the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, humiliating the country and forfeiting its sovereignty, recognizing the puppet Manchukuo, and betraying the four northeastern provinces. He also served as the puppet ambassador to Japan, contacting various countries, and the puppet government obtained recognition from nine countries, including Germany and Italy. He returned to China in September of the 30th year and continued to serve as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, declaring war on the Allied nations of Britain and the United States. The defendant made every effort to have various countries recognize the puppet government, in effect regarding it as a formal government, which was no different from opposing the central government, and his declaration of war on the Allied nations was in effect no different from declaring war on the central government. In October of the 32nd year, he re-signed the Alliance Treaty with Japan, and in November, he accompanied the traitor Wang to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference, colluding with enemy countries and plotting to resist our own country. His crimes are extremely evident. Furthermore, during his tenure as Vice President of the Executive Yuan, he allowed the enemy to establish the North China Revitalization Company and the Central China Revitalization Company in its occupied areas, and established fifteen branch companies under them. Administration, transportation, food, and minerals were all under enemy control and at their disposal. During his tenure as the Governor of Guangdong Province, he conspired with Matsui, the liaison officer of the enemy, to increase the Guangdong customs tax by 80 million, with half going to the enemy and half going to the province, which further exacerbated his crimes of aiding the enemy. Therefore, he should be tried according to the law."</p>
<p>The Traitor Chu's Defense</p>
<p>Presiding Judge Sun then ordered the traitor Chu to respond, and Chu immediately put on his tortoiseshell spectacles and spread out his defense statement. However, this document was extremely fragmented and trivial, with many points that were irrelevant to the case. In brief: "(1) Although he and Wang were relatives, they were classmates when studying in France. After joining the Tongmenghui, they were comrades. He studied under the traitor Wang, and after taking office, Wang was his superior and he was his subordinate. Therefore, the depth of their relationship was more than just because of kinship, and he deeply admired Wang's character. (2) Before the Incident, he devoted himself to party affairs, education, and medicine, and was not affected by political forces. When he was in France, Wu Jingheng and others loved and cherished him very much and advised him not to engage in politics, but to establish a Chinese-French National Industrial Specialized School, and later he served as the principal of that school. Before the January 28th Incident, Jiang and Wang were sometimes united and sometimes divided, such as the Zhongshan Warship Incident, the Ninghan split, the Expanded Conference, and the Extraordinary Conference, he did not participate in any of them. In the 21st year, when Wang served as the President of the Executive Yuan, Zeng Zhongming wanted to transfer to become the Director of the Railway Department, so he succeeded him as the Secretary-General. In December of the 22nd year, Wang was assassinated and resigned, and he also left. In the 25th year, he served as the Deputy Director of the National Congress Representative Election Office (the Director was Jiang Zuobin). In the 27th year, he went to Hankou and Chongqing twice, both times to raise funds for the Chinese-French School, which had nothing to do with politics. Wang and Yingzuo and Imai, he did not know about the secret agreements. (3) Wang went to Nanjing and Qingdao twice to organize the Maintenance and Provisional puppet organizations. He was just one of the staff members. The conditions for peace and the establishment of the government were all Wang's proposals. He only heard about them. The establishment of the Nanjing government was two years and four months after the fall of Nanjing. During this period, the people had suffered extremely. The establishment of the government could allow the people to suffer less from direct Japanese rule. Wang advocated negotiating with Chongqing because he believed that resistance was to save the country, but peace was also to save the country. After reading Yandian, he suspected that this was a division of labor (Mr. Jiang is martial and Mr. Wang is literary). He once participated in the peace movement (a book was sent to the court). Wang believed that resistance had already begun and was easy to maintain, while peace was not easy. He told Mr. Jiang, 'You do the easy thing, I do the difficult thing,' and he firmly believed that different paths would inevitably lead to the same destination. Wang's organization of the government also restored the party organization, which indicated that he had not betrayed the party or the country. The year and the national title were the same, unlike the Maintenance and Provisional government, which established separate names. The yellow cloth strip on the national flag was also removed after Wang came. Therefore, Nanjing was actually indirectly resisting Japan, indirectly resisting Japan, and peacefully resisting Japan. (4) After he signed the treaty with Japan, the sovereignty and land did not decrease as a result, so it cannot be called humiliating the country and forfeiting its sovereignty. The name 'Alliance Treaty' is better than the 'Basic Treaty' in terms of wording, and he did not countersign these two treaties and is not responsible for signing them. He also did not sign the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. Puppet Manchukuo was an established fact, and we had no choice but to endure the pain for a while to obtain Sino-Manchukuo relations and gradually try to recover it. (5) The declaration of war against Britain and the United States was issued by the National Government in Wang's own name, without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because Britain and the United States did not have diplomatic relations with the puppet government. At this point, he praised the Sino-Japanese joint anti-communist proposal, saying that the abolition of joint anti-communism on May 4 of the 34th year was the main reason for Japan's failure. He considered that the recovery of concessions after the declaration of war against Britain and the United States was a 'joke.' The Axis countries' recognition of the puppet government was a trend of the times and not his doing alone. (6) During the enemy occupation, all departments were able to negotiate with the Japanese. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs only sent people to welcome and send off guests. In fact, it was a 'social department.' He engaged in social and cultural undertakings in his spare time, such as hygiene, music, and movies."</p>
<p>Voluntarily Accepting Punishment</p>
<p>He then boasted of his achievements, saying that he alone had come to the mausoleum to silently read the Premier's will and sing the party song alone. He also said that China and Japan are of the same race and culture and share the same Buddhist faith, so he had renovated temples and obtained the sarira of the Tang monk Xuanzang, and replaced an eleven-foot-tall Thousand-Hand Guanyin with a 33-foot-tall Guanyin carved from a single tree in Nagoya. "(7) He allowed the people in the occupied areas to continue party activities under Japanese rule, and he did not betray the party or the country. (8) The Central China and North China Revitalization Companies were recognized during the Maintenance and Provisional government periods and were not within his authority. The Guangdong tax increase of 80 million was fabricated by the court, and the confession was more harmful than being beaten. In fact, the crimes he committed were sufficient to warrant the death penalty. He asked the prosecutor not to add unfounded charges against him. He knew on the 13th that Chen Gongbo had been sentenced to death, 'and I will certainly be sentenced to death as well.' But he had received a telegram from the Chairman saying, 'He is guilty of joining the enemy, but considering that he has followed the Premier in the revolution for many years and maintained law and order in Guangdong after the Japanese surrender, he can be dealt with leniently.' Although it is difficult to distinguish between truth and falsehood, he voluntarily chose to die." At this point, he read out the addendum to his defense statement, titled "A Few Words for the General Peace Comrades," stating in brief: "There is a lack of talent at present. People are forced by livelihood, and the officials, large and small, who worked in the puppet government should be treated leniently." He also criticized the Military Intelligence Bureau for not having the legal authority to arrest people and for using deception when arresting them. He also criticized the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors in a pedantic manner and pointed out that the suffering of the people in the occupied areas of Chongqing was not as severe as the suffering of one-two-hundredth of the people after the victory. He concluded by saying, "I deserve to be punished and can follow Mr. Wang underground, leading those waiting for punishment, without any regrets." At this time, the court announced a brief recess. The court reopened at 5:25 PM. The presiding judge first presented the puppet appointment letter, the Guangdong Provincial Government meeting records, the joint statement, the records of the puppet National Government officials going to Japan to express gratitude, and Chu's "World Situation and East Asian Unity" to Chu for him to read and asked: "How many times have you been to Japan?" He replied, "In the 29th year of the Republic, I went to Japan with Chen Gongbo to express gratitude. I served as the ambassador to Japan in the 30th year. In that year, Wang visited Japan for the first time. I went twice in the spring and autumn of the 31st year. In the autumn, I accompanied Wang on his second visit to Japan. In the 32nd year, I went to the Greater East Asia Medical Conference. On November 5 of the same year, I went to Japan to attend the Greater East Asia Conference. In the 33rd year, I went to visit Wang when he was ill. Wang attended the Greater East Asia Conference, and I was in attendance." The court then played his broadcast recording "The Review and New Understanding of the September 18th Incident," which contained statements such as "Jiang Jieshi is stubborn and self-willed, harming the country and the people" and "Empty words deceive the people." Chu appeared very uneasy while listening and said, "I can hear that it is my voice." The court asked, "Did you go to Japan specifically to have the Axis countries recognize the puppet government?" He replied, "Yes." The court asked, "When were they recognized?" He replied, "It was the trend of the times and not my doing alone." The court asked, "Did Wang sign the treaty himself? Did you not handle it?" He replied, "I sometimes participated in the discussions." The court asked, "During your tenure as the Governor of Guangdong Province, did you ban opium?" He replied, "Yes. The Opium Prohibition Bureau was directly under the Opium Prohibition Supervisor. I assisted the special envoy of the Opium Prohibition Bureau and requested the airline in Shanghai to transport 30,000 taels of opium to Guangdong in June." The court asked, "It is good to ban opium, but why did you transport it in large quantities?" He replied, "Public sale." The court asked, "Then it is not banning opium, it is selling opium?" He replied, "Yes, it is prohibition through taxation, and it is the responsibility of the Opium Prohibition Supervisor, not the provincial government." The court said, "The telegrams were between you and Chen Gongbo?" He replied, "Only the economic aspects were related to the provincial government." The court asked, "Regarding the 80 million opium tax with Matsui, although you do not admit it, the records show a conversation with Matsui in which it was said, 'The tax revenue can be increased by 80 million, half of which will be submitted to the central government as a subsidy for the province, and half of which will subsidize the Japanese army.'" He replied, "There was such a discussion, but it was not implemented."</p>
<p>The Prosecutor's Accusation</p>
<p>The court then announced the completion of the evidence investigation. Chief Prosecutor Han rose to make his accusation, stating in brief: "(1) The defendant considered himself to be saving the country and the people, but Chongqing already had a central government. The establishment of the puppet government in Nanjing was actually adding to the suffering of the people. The puppet government not only did not relieve the suffering of the people, but also increased taxes and extorted money. (2) Peaceful resistance is a joke. To 'resist,' you need guns. Moreover, the puppet government repeatedly stated that it would share weal and woe and even live and die together. (3) Since the September 18th Incident, the country has never recognized that the Northeast has been lost and vowed to recover it. That is why there was resistance. The puppet government was the first to sign a treaty, recognizing that it was an ally with the enemy. Although Wang signed it, the defendant, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, cannot deny that he knew about it. (4) After the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, although he claimed that it was to remove extraterritoriality, has the puppet court ever tried a Japanese person? The recovery of the concessions has nothing to do with the defendant. (5) The defendant considers the return to the capital as a merit, but the return to the capital of Wang Zhaoming and a few other traitors is simply treason. (6) The defendant also knows about the harm caused by the Central China and North China Revitalization Companies. The tax increase of 80 million would have been implemented if the war had not ended. (7) The suffering of the people in the occupied areas is so deep. How can there be no legal sanctions? The defendant's claim that the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors cannot be applied is absurd. (8) The defendant criticizes the law improperly, but this seat can only accuse him according to the law and has no need to refute this point." At this point, the court ordered [blank character] to respond. [Blank character] stated in brief: "Resistance can be done orally or in writing and does not necessarily require guns." He claimed that it was very difficult to organize the puppet government and that there were too few talented people. Therefore, corruption and espionage were indeed facts. He also praised the Vichy government and Petain for enduring humiliation for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>Publishing the Defense Statement</p>
<p>At this point, the traitor Chu was exhausted and hoarse, and his words were fragmented. He claimed that he had violated Article 2, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors and asked the presiding judge to sentence him to death, saying that life imprisonment was too uneconomical. He concluded by saying that he had always supported peace and that he had not changed his mind to this day. The presiding judge then supplemented his question, "Did the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Declaration go through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?" He replied, "It was handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The declaration of war against Britain and the United States did not go through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs." The court asked, "What about the Basic and Alliance treaties?" He replied, "They were handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but I did not sign them." The court asked, "Have you seen the original draft of the declaration of war?" He replied, "I saw it after it was published. It was handed over to the Propaganda Department by the puppet government." The court asked, "Did the puppet government plan to cooperate with the Nationalist army when the American army landed in the later stages of the war? Was there any contact with the central government about this?" He replied, "I did not communicate with Chongqing. I heard Chen Gongbo talk about it. There was communication." The court asked, "Is there any basis for this statement?" He replied, "Yes, everyone agreed verbally. In fact, if we did not cooperate internally, we would be attacked from both sides. Chen Bijun called me to Guangdong and ordered me to maintain law and order during the transition period." At this point, Gao Rong, the public defender of the Jiangsu High Court, rose to defend him, stating in brief: "Before the victory, many people thought that Wang and Chongqing had a tacit understanding and that peace and resistance would lead to the same destination. The defendant truly believed that they would lead to the same destination and his situation is pitiable. Even if he sold opium, it was for prohibition through taxation. The people of the Northeast and North China were indeed more miserable than the general people of the Nanjing puppet government. He is tired of the world and seeks death and should still be sentenced according to the law." Finally, the traitor Chu also cited the example of the traitor Chen Gongbo and requested that his defense be published. The court approved it and announced the conclusion of the debate and that the sentencing would be at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 22nd. The traitor Chu then said: "I will come again on the 22nd," bowed, and left. The time was already 7:15.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Traitor Chu Minyi Being Escorted from the Detention Center to the Court</p>
<h3>Passing Through Honolulu to Tokyo; Marshall Hurries Back to China; Gillen, Qin Decun, and Others Hold a Meeting in Shenyang</h3>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 14th] President Truman's special envoy, Marshal Marshall, and his wife departed from Washington, D.C., to return to their post in China. They arrived here today and declared: "We do not know how long we will stay in China." Marshal Marshall did not express his opinion on the purpose of this trip or the fact that his family members were traveling with him. He will depart from here tonight, traveling through Tokyo to China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 15th] The representatives of the Military Three-Person Group are coming to Shenyang to investigate the truth. Their mission is scheduled to be completed tomorrow, and they will return to the capital to report to the three members of the group. According to the opinion of people here, even if special envoy Marshall returns to China and uses his great ability to mediate and prevent bloodshed, it is still doubtful. There are currently two fierce battles underway in the Northeast, with heavy casualties on both sides. According to government sources, the New First Army is slowly advancing towards Siping, encountering a fierce attack from 40,000 Communist troops. Thirty miles southeast of Shenyang, two divisions of the Nationalist 52nd Army are surrounded by Communist troops in the Benxi iron mining area and are currently trying to repel the Communist troops. Now that the fighting is underway, the executive group is helpless. Marshall is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the 16th and will definitely arrive in China within a few days. The situation that Marshall is now encountering is, if not more difficult, certainly as difficult as when he began trying to unite the Nationalist and Communist armies in China and jointly preserve lasting peace last December. This is well known and no secret. Three-person group representatives Gillen, Qin Decun, and Chen Shiqu met with representatives from the city for two hours on the 15th and then inspected the factory area. Slogans have been found throughout the city, loudly shouting "Oppose the division of the Northeast" and "Oppose negotiations with bandits."</p>
<h3>The Government Decides to Reorganize as Soon as Possible; The Chairman Hosts a Tea Party for Members of the Political Consultative Conference Small Group; All Parties Accept Instructions to Conduct Consultations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Chairman Chiang invited all members of the Comprehensive Small Group of the Political Consultative Conference to a tea party at the National Government at 4:00 PM on the 15th. Those in attendance included Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Lifu, Zhou Enlai, Lu Dingyi, Chen Qitian, Zhang Junmai, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Wang Yunwu, Fu Sinian, Wu Dingchang, and Lei Zhen, totaling more than a dozen people. Chairman Chiang first explained that it had been more than two months since the closing of the Political Consultative Conference and that the reorganization of the government should be realized as soon as possible to stabilize the people's hearts. The convening of the National Congress on May 5 was originally decided by the Political Consultative Conference. Now that the deadline is approaching, the procedures for selecting and announcing representatives will still take a considerable amount of time. It is hoped that the lists of representatives to be submitted by all parties will be submitted to the government for processing before April 20. It is also hoped that the list of National Government Committee members will be submitted at the same time so that the government reorganization can be completed before the return to the capital. Otherwise, the reorganization should be carried out as soon as possible after the return to the capital so that the work of peaceful national construction can be gradually implemented. After the Chairman finished speaking, members Zhou Enlai, Zhang Junmai, Wang Yunwu, and Chen Qitian expressed their opinions one after another and accepted the Chairman's instructions. They hoped that designated personnel would be appointed to conduct consultations. The Chairman immediately appointed members Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, and Zhang Lisheng and Secretary-General Lei to be responsible for inviting all parties to consult within three or four days to ensure that the government reorganization could be realized as soon as possible and that the National Congress could be convened as scheduled. It is heard that Shao and others will begin consultations separately from the 16th. In addition, the drafting small group for the draft constitutional amendment of the Political Consultative Conference was originally scheduled to convene on the afternoon of the 15th, but due to Chairman Chiang's invitation to all members of the Comprehensive Small Group of the conference to a tea party, it was changed to 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th.</p>
<h3>The Verdict and Defense of the Traitor Chen Gongbo are Being Reviewed by the Supreme Court; The Families of the Traitors Chen and Chu Prepare for the Aftermath</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The verdict of the traitor Chen Gongbo and the traitor Chen's defense statement have been delivered to the Supreme Court. According to a certain judge, although the traitor Chen did not appeal, the Supreme Court must still review the traitor Chen's confession, the verdict of the Jiangsu High Court, and the traitor Chen's defense statement in accordance with legal procedures. The fate of the traitor Chen can be decided within the next three days. If the Supreme Court upholds the original verdict in its final ruling on Chen's crimes and sentences him to death, the method of execution may not be hanging, but shooting. The execution site should ideally be in Nanjing, but to avoid the trouble of escorting him, it may be possible to have him die in Suzhou. It is heard that the family of the traitor Chen has begun to prepare for Chen's funeral. It is heard that the family of the traitor Chu Minyi has also begun to prepare Chu's clothes and coffin. Furthermore, according to a certain gentleman close to the legal community, the major traitors of the puppet government may die on the same day, in the same place, and in the same manner, so that China Electric can film a large-scale scene to show the dignity of the national law.</p>
<h3>The Capital Begins Investigating Male and Female Traitors Today</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the capital's work on investigating traitors is ready, and the investigation will begin on the 16th. It is said that the first to be interrogated will be major traitors such as Lin Baisheng, Li Shengwu, Mei Siping, Chen Junhui, and Mo Guokang. It is said that the female traitor, Mo Guokang, has been crying all day since Chen Gongbo was sentenced to death, muttering to herself when she sees people, and saying, "I am willing to die in the same lake as Chen Gongbo."</p>

<h3>Iran Suddenly Withdraws Complaint Hours Before Security Council Meeting; Members Repeatedly Reject Soviet Request; Tudeh Party Mutiny Creates Emergency in Iranian Political Situation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 15th Broadcasting: Hours before the Security Council meeting, the Iranian government suddenly announced that it had instructed its representative to the Security Council to immediately remove the Iranian issue from the agenda. Before announcing this decision, the Iranian Prime Minister had met twice with the new Soviet Ambassador, who assured him that the withdrawal of Soviet troops could be completed before May 6. However, for the sake of caution, the Security Council will nominally keep the Iranian issue on the agenda until it receives confirmation of the Soviet troop withdrawal on May 6.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] At today's Security Council meeting, the member states decided to reject the Soviet Union's request to immediately remove the Iranian issue from the agenda, even if Iran asked them to do so.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 15th] It has been learned here today that the powerful leftist Tudeh Party successfully mutinied yesterday in the industrial center of Isfahan, completely controlling the city, and its influence has expanded to about 300 miles along the Persian Gulf and the southern British oil fields. This mutiny has created a sudden emergency situation for the Iranian government.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] A new dispute will erupt at today's Security Council meeting. The Iranian issue will be the first case on the agenda, and the case of Poland requesting action against the Franco regime in the West may be debated on Wednesday. The Polish representative has been preparing their case over the weekend, and this case will again cause a dispute between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>[United Press, Madrid, 15th] The Spanish Minister of Education formally denied last night that any German scientists were conducting atomic energy or other scientific research in Spain, and said that those who accused Spain of this "know very well where German scientists are researching the atomic bomb," but he did not specify the location.</p>
<h3>Truman's Speech at "Pan American Day": People Seeking Happiness Must Have International Cooperation; Foundation of American Good Neighbor Policy is Solid</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 15th] The United States commemorated Pan American Day yesterday. President Truman delivered a speech to the Council of the Pan American Union, stating briefly: History will also record how President Roosevelt and his great Secretary of State Hull worked hard to prevent war before 1939 and spread this Good Neighbor policy to the rest of the world. He was hampered by the madness and dreams of world conquest of the Axis dictators and aggressors. However, when the United Nations fought against Nazi fascism, the United States began to lay the foundation for a Good Neighbor policy towards the whole world. You also know how solid the foundation of the Good Neighbor policy is. The United Nations, based on these foundations, has now launched a common cause. I am convinced that the cause of the United Nations will succeed, and must succeed. Before us is a new era, in which the power of atomic energy has been unleashed. In this era, either there will be complete destruction, or the labor of people all over the world will be reduced and the standard of living will be raised. In order to maintain lasting peace, the people of the world have now shown that they are willing to use force when necessary to prevent aggression or the threat of aggression. Everyone is aware that the existence of this force, although it may prevent aggression from running rampant, cannot in itself eliminate the causes of unrest. Like the causes of World War II, beneath the madness of the Nazis were the material difficulties and spiritual hunger caused by poverty and despair. Unless these economic diseases that constitute the causes of war are completely eliminated, the danger of war cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, we must achieve a material, cultural, and spiritual life that all people in the world have the right to enjoy. We must contribute our energy and resources to this goal. Apart from the word "democracy," I don't know any other word that encompasses this goal. Democrats are fighting for a better life for free people everywhere today. We all feel that the word "democracy" has different meanings in different languages. This term will have different interpretations in different parts of the world, but fortunately, American countries have a common basic understanding of the word "democracy."</p>
<p>Freedom first requires certain political rights, namely freedom of speech, publication, and assembly, freedom of conscience, and the right of the people to choose their form of government. This goal obviously depends on the efforts of each country itself, but if we have learned anything from the past decade, we should know that no country can survive alone. Only through genuine cooperation can the whole world achieve this goal. They need international cooperation in military power to jointly expand production, increase world trade, and develop natural resources, so that all efforts to improve living standards can be established on a solid foundation. The principles that have guided Pan American work in the past already contain this spirit of cooperation. We must, in the days to come, put these principles into practical action and generate concrete results.</p>

<h3>British Instruct Representatives to India to Quickly Find a Solution; Opportunity to End Rule in India is Ripe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The political secretary of the British Independent Labour Party, Brockway, declared yesterday at a mass meeting of the British Indian Association here: The British Labour government has instructed the three cabinet members, Lawrence, Cripps, and Alexander, who are going to India for negotiations, to reach an agreement with Indian leaders before returning home. There are three reasons why the Labour government issued this instruction: (1) The British government knows that the Indian problem must be resolved, and the Indian naval rebellion especially requires Britain to end its rule in India immediately; (2) Britain is now the third strongest country after the United States and the Soviet Union, and knows that Indian discontent will threaten Britain's international policy; (3) Britain needs to find new markets for its goods, which has changed the political landscape. Brockway continued that if the British Labour government wants to convince the Indians of its sincerity in resolving the Indian problem, then the following two things must be done first: (1) Release those who have been detained in court for political reasons; (2) Immediately abolish the salt tax.</p>

<h3>Re-discussing the Housing Shortage Problem in Shanghai</h3>
<p>This newspaper discussed the housing shortage problem in Shanghai yesterday because the Executive Yuan recently promulgated measures for allocating housing to various agencies. In fact, the scope of the discussion was only to examine whether the measures stipulated by the Executive Yuan were desirable, and it was still unable to thoroughly investigate how the housing shortage problem could be solved. The meaning was still not exhausted, and we must elaborate further.</p>
<p>Last night, this newspaper received two letters from readers, both expressing their views on the housing shortage problem. One provided supplementary opinions on the Executive Yuan's measures, and the other contributed to this problem from the perspective of government legislation. Here, we will first excerpt the main points of these two letters and then explain our views.</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Xie Yunyi's letter stated, in essence: "The provisions of the Executive Yuan's measures are undoubtedly the proper way to solve the housing problem in this city. However, if there are any imperfections in the implementation of the measures, they should be improved, and the interests of the state and the people should be taken into account. Therefore, these measures should have supplements: First, the principle that this law does not apply retroactively, in order to safeguard the interests of the people, it should be stipulated that households who have already legally rented before the promulgation of these measures should still be regarded as valid after the Housing Committee reviews them and finds no evidence of fraud. Second, except for legally rented houses, houses not owned by enemies or puppets should be uniformly leased by the Central Trust Bureau. As for how to apply for, review, and allocate houses uniformly leased by the Central Trust Bureau, there should also be clear regulations, which should be announced at any time to show great trust. In short, regarding the current housing problem in Shanghai, the government and the people feel the same difficulties. The people should understand and support the government's emergency measures for the urgent need for restoration, and the government should also carefully safeguard the interests of the people. The power of the government should be emphasized, and the freedom of the people should be respected. Only by considering both the national economy and the people's livelihood can we solve the housing problem in Shanghai properly."</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Zhang Etang's letter stated, in essence: "The reason why the supply of houses in Shanghai cannot meet the demand should also be thoroughly explored in terms of government legislation. The wartime housing lease regulations promulgated by the government on December 13, 1943, were originally necessary emergency measures to adapt to wartime needs, and the legislative spirit should be strict, which is understandable. However, on March 18, 1946, the Shanghai Municipal Government revised and promulgated the regulations on housing lease management and the standards for housing rents in Shanghai. The restrictions on the rent and other fees set for landlords are open to discussion in the current social situation. According to these two regulations, the main provisions regarding rent include (1) Landlords shall not collect key money or petty rent from tenants in addition to rent. If they violate this, tenants may sue the court for return. (2) For houses with rent agreed upon before August 13, 1937, the calculation standard should be 60 times for commercial houses and 40 times for residential houses. For those after August 13, 1937, the rent should be calculated according to the same building section and estimated value as in the previous paragraph. Now, this standard has been changed to 180 times and 140 times by the municipal government meeting a few days ago, which is indeed fairer than before. However, according to the current price expenses, landlords who rely on rent income for a living will inevitably still feel difficult. If they ask tenants to adjust and increase rent, they will definitely refuse to pay attention to the regulations. Because large landlords have no profit to be made, they will inevitably prefer to leave the houses idle and not rent them to others, or they are unwilling to invest in building houses. Furthermore, according to Article 11, Paragraph 5 of the Regulations on Housing Lease Management, if a tenant sublets a house and the rent charged exceeds 30% of the original rent, the landlord may terminate the contract. This makes sub-landlords unwilling to sublet vacant houses to others. For example, if a sub-landlord sublets a house with a monthly rent of 1,000 yuan to others, the rent charged cannot exceed 300 yuan at most. Currently, just the deposit for water and electricity guarantee that the sub-landlord bears usually requires paying 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, which is equivalent to wasting interest, although it can be recovered in the future, and other house repair costs are now mostly borne by the sub-landlord, not to mention. Because the profits obtained by the sub-landlord are too limited, they do not compensate for the losses. Unless they want to ask for trouble, they will sublet the house to others, so that most sub-landlords are currently willing to close the door and live alone, enjoying spacious comfort. Before the war, there were advertisements for rent everywhere. During the enemy-puppet period, because there were regulations in the subletting license that the rent charged could not exceed a certain percentage, the advertisements for rent gradually decreased, and now they are simply not seen. In this situation where the index of everything has risen more than a thousand times compared to before the war, there is no legal sanction, but only the rent is forced to not be increased. Such a deformed and unreasonable situation can only serve to unilaterally suppress the rise in rent, but in fact, it only increases the degree of housing shortage. As far as I can see, (1) Key money and petty rent are close to unjust enrichment and must be strictly prohibited. If landlords violate this, not only can they sue the court for return, but the government should also impose heavy fines. (2) Rent should still be determined by mutual agreement in accordance with the Civil Code as a principle. At most, only the monthly rent charged by the landlord for renting out a house should be restricted to not exceed a few thousandths of the original building's valuation. The monthly rent charged by the sub-landlord for subletting a house should not exceed the total amount of the original rent. If the situation changes, it can be increased or decreased with the mutual consent of both parties, or the Housing Management Committee can be asked to mediate. In this way, the rent charged by the landlord for renting out a house will not be without a standard. Sub-landlords can also make a small profit by subletting houses, except for the losses that cannot be shared with the tenants, so as to avoid the disadvantages of closing the house and not renting it. (3) In Article 9 of the Regulations on Housing Lease Management, which stipulates the reasons for terminating the lease, a clause should be added, such as "If the tenant no longer needs the leased house." Because the rent in Shanghai is too low, many residents are greedy for convenience, or prepare it as a place for travel, or the population is small, occupying a large portion, or they rent it out instead of using it. Such situations are not uncommon. When the demand for houses exceeds the supply, strict laws must be enacted to prevent tenants from hoarding houses to harm others and benefit themselves."</p>
<p>The opinions of the two readers quoted above can all be regarded as calm and rational discussions, and they have considerable reasons. We believe that the authorities, looking at the overall situation, will adopt them if they are desirable and can be expected to be adopted in moderation. Here, we would like to add a few more points:</p>
<p>First of all, we believe that the method of uniform leasing by the Central Trust Bureau stipulated by the Executive Yuan should not only be applicable to ordinary private real estate not owned by enemies or puppets, but also should be moderately applicable to houses owned by enemies or puppets. Because if we really want to solve the housing shortage problem, we must focus on this theme. The more houses opened, the better. It does not seem appropriate to simultaneously consider providing a lump sum income for the national treasury. If it is only as stipulated in the original method, "Houses occupied by enemy aliens and owned by enemies or puppets shall be uniformly received and sold by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District," then this large amount of houses will inevitably be exclusively occupied by a few wealthy merchants, and may not be widely rented to civil servants and ordinary citizens. Moreover, it makes people feel that the enemy and puppet real estate received by the government is only sold, and not rented to various agencies and civil servants for housing. Instead, it forces private real estate to be uniformly leased by the Central Trust Bureau, which does not seem fair. The handling of all things in the world should be fair, and if it is not fair, people will naturally complain. Therefore, in order for the government to show its sincerity in solving the housing shortage, it is especially important to take the lead in setting an example of how to uniformly rent out the real estate that the government can control in the future. Moreover, whether there are actually all kinds of subjects in the method of uniform sale. It also seems very questionable at this time whether you are willing to bid for high-priced real estate from the government. The government's temporary lump sum income may not be guaranteed, and it must first force the residents who originally lived in this enemy and puppet real estate to move out within a time limit before it is sold, making them have to compete with other citizens for other types of housing, which seems to increase the degree of housing panic.</p>
<p>Secondly, the uniform leasing of private real estate by the Trust Bureau should be regarded as the principle of the method, and exceptions cannot be tolerated within a reasonable scope. This so-called exception is not to open a door of convenience, but to respect the legitimate rights and interests of the original owners and the legitimate leases of various agencies or civil servants, which must be done in this way. For example: If the house was actually used by the owner himself before the war, and there is a household registration record in the neighborhood, but it was forcibly occupied or rented by the enemy or puppets due to the war, and now the owner has either returned to Shanghai from afar, or moved back to the Hongkou Jiangwan area from Haman, and still needs to use it himself, and can find a reliable guarantee, whether in terms of emotion, reason, or law, he should be allowed to use it himself and exempted from uniform leasing. Furthermore, if the owner has indeed entered into a legal lease with various normal agencies or restored civil servants before the promulgation of these seven measures, then from the original intention of the government's uniform leasing, it cannot be considered contrary to this. The owner has neither met with illegal and illegally obtained key money or petty rent, and his tenants are also the objects to whom the government must allocate housing, then why should the government "re-lease" them once again, which is not afraid of trouble? We hope that the responsible committee and the Central Trust Bureau should carefully consider such matters. As for Mr. Xie's principle that this law does not apply retroactively, acknowledging the validity of all previously signed leases is theoretically feasible, but it should be noted whether these signed leases have the fact of being handed over and backdated? It is said that recently, when the enemy aliens vacated a certain large alley on Shigaota Road in Hongkou, the owner, a certain real estate company, turned it into zero overnight, turning it into several owners. Each building became the owner's own use, but in fact, the real estate company collected huge amounts of key money and petty rent and signed separate leases. This kind of behavior will naturally be unbearable for the poor civil servants who have returned from the rear!</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to discuss the issue of rent. Mr. Zhang believes that the rent restriction is too low, hindering the construction of new houses, which is partly true. However, it is not certain at this time whether allowing the rent to be increased can satisfy the landlord's desires and encourage their interest in building houses. It must be known that the current market interest rate is often above 10%. May I ask whether the rent can be so high even if it is high? Assuming that the cost of materials and labor is estimated, a single building will cost 10 million yuan. Can the monthly rent be stipulated to be 1 million yuan? Even if the government does not restrict it and allows it completely, may I ask which ordinary citizens can rent this kind of single building? To be honest, in today's deformed market, unless interest rates return to normal, the major event of building houses to please the people is something that probably no private individual is willing to invest in unless the government takes responsibility for it! Moreover, the method of allowing the rent to be increased and determined according to the cost valuation ratio can only be applied to newly built houses. As for houses that have been built for a long time, even if they can be allowed to be increased moderately, they are not allowed to be rented according to this calculation, because the value at the time of construction was indeed low. Now, after the war, the houses still exist, which is equivalent to the fact that the cost they paid at that time has preserved its monetary value. If the interest is calculated based on this increased value and the rent is determined, then the rent must be surprisingly high, and this kind of excessive profit for the landlord is nothing more than the exploitation of the blood and sweat of ordinary poor people. We admit that large landlords are mostly unprofitable at this time, but please ask them to make a big calculation. After eight years of bloody war, they were still able to preserve the houses, which is equivalent to preserving the monetary value. They are very lucky. What should be required for them is that at this time, the transfer or lease of real estate should not unduly force them to pay excessive taxes, so that the sale and purchase of real estate can be circulated. We also admit that sub-landlords are not all bad, and third tenants are not necessarily all deceived, but in any case, sub-landlords "rent land as self-produced," and after renting a house, they can ask for a price for the key money, but the owner has no right to ask questions, which is ultimately the main reason why the owner is bored in the future. Therefore, when studying the housing problem today, we must first use political power to fully protect the owner's sovereignty within the scope of the law, and increasing the rent is secondary.</p>

<p>Since the county seat of this county was recovered by the National Army, Huangqiao Town in the Fourth District is still occupied by the Communist army of Chen Yusheng's unit. Conscription and requisition of grain are the basic tasks of this army. In recent months, the approach has been greatly changed, with what is called "two months of undemocratic rule". All township and village chiefs and paochia heads, as well as those with some assets and knowledge in the areas controlled by the army, are given the title of "Nationalist Special Agents" and subjected to large-scale arrests and extortion of property. Any resistance is met with brutal killing. The citizens of the town are living in dire straits. Recently, postal services between the city and Huangqiao have also been blocked. After the local post office was forcibly taken over by the Communist army last month, on April 1st, all Chinese Communist Party (CCP) stamps were uniformly used, and the use of legal tender was strictly prohibited. The original post office staff were forced to undergo training and were not granted freedom.

<h3>Important Nazi Intelligence Agency Uncovered; Leader Was a Confidant of Hitler; All Culprits Arrested by American Troops; May Be Tried in China; Yesterday Already Transferred to the Ward Road Jail</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the United Press, Shanghai, 15th] After the surrender of Germany, its intelligence agencies in China continued to operate until the Japanese aggressors surrendered. It is reported that seven German intelligence officers, after several months of investigation, were arrested by the American military today, along with one Japanese national. They will all be listed as war criminals for endangering the United States. This is an important batch of international war criminals arrested by the Far East Command. It is rumored that these individuals may be tried in China. Among those arrested, Lieutenant Colonel Anhalt is the most "famous". Anhalt's other names are Ernst Wagener, and he is also known as Count Schwerin. US Navy Lieutenant Farrell has been assigned to handle the Anhalt case since last September. According to him, Anhalt was a confidant of Hitler and served as the leader of the German Fifth Column in the Balkans in the 1930s. Anhalt is nearly sixty years old but is very energetic. He had great influence in the Nazi regime and had the authority to discuss national affairs with major ambassadors. Among the other arrested are Herbert Natter, a German code expert. The American coastal defense code was once deciphered by him, so German submarines were once very successful in sinking American ships, and he received a medal for this. One Japanese person was arrested, named Takashima, 29 years old. When Japanese General Yamashita visited Germany before the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy and Japan, Takashima served as Yamashita's adjutant and is rumored to be an important figure among Japanese spies.</p>
<p>During the war, all communications between Germany and Japan were handled by him. Takashima served as the president of the Central China Promotion Company, which was established by the Japanese and was a powerful agency for controlling Chinese materials. Takashima was an honorary major in the Japanese Army. The other German arrested was Lejeune, 43 years old, who was the personal pilot of former German Air Force Commander Goering. His important duty was to gather air force intelligence. War criminals were sent to the free areas of China to investigate the situation of the US Air Force stationed in China. Another German, named Schenk, was a German correspondent in China. He is rumored to be a spy with rich experience, outwardly pretending to oppose the Nazis,</p>
<p>Supporting Chongqing,</p>
<p>Even writing articles attacking Hitler, to gain the trust of the Chinese people. It is said that he discovered the route for Americans to escape to the free areas of China. In addition, two people named Rossi and Montevini, who were radio operators on the Italian ship "Conte Verde", were also arrested for being employed by Anhalt to engage in espionage. Two others, Rudolf and Detlef, are already in custody. Rudolf was a German naval captain, rumored to have come to China with Anhalt in 1942. Detlef was a</p>
<p>Code expert.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Connell of the US military court's prosecutor's office in China notified the defendants this morning to report for investigation. The group gathered in one room, and three US military police ordered them to line up and state their names. The group felt caught off guard by the arrest. They have now been sent to the Ward Road Jail, and it remains to be decided when and where they will be tried. The Chinese side is also interested in this case, as the defendants' actions clearly endangered China. However, it is believed that the US will obtain permission to handle the case freely. The US military authorities announced today that no German spies have escaped so far. Farrell and Gores of the US Special Intelligence Group began to handle this case immediately after Japan's surrender, sparing no effort. During the investigation, they traveled to Guangzhou, Beijing, and other places.</p>
<h3>Last Batch of Japanese Nationals Leave Shanghai by Ship</h3>

<h3>First Members' Representative Assembly of the Three Principles of the People Youth League</h3>
<p>The first Members' Representative Assembly of the Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League opened at 10 a.m. the day before yesterday. The assembly was held at the site of the Provisional Council and was scheduled to last three days. On the first day (the day before yesterday), the opening ceremony was held, and the newly elected supervisors and inspectors of each district branch took their oath of office. Xuan Tiewu, a special delegate sent by the Central Ministry stationed in Shanghai, attended to supervise the oath-taking ceremony, which was presided over by Director-General Wu Shaoshu. Youth League instructor Qian Dajun and Central League representative Xuan Qianwu also delivered speeches after the chairman's opening remarks.

<h3>Electricity Bills to Increase Surcharge; Additional 26 Yuan per Kilowatt-Hour; Explanation of Reasons by Public Utilities Bureau Officials</h3>
<p>The surcharge on electricity prices in this city will increase by 26 yuan per kilowatt-hour from April 16th. According to officials of the Public Utilities Bureau, the price of electricity in this city has always been based on the price of coal. The coal used by the power plants in this city is allocated by the government, so the price of electricity is lower than in major domestic cities. For example, the price of electricity for small households in Chongqing is 150 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and in Nanjing it is 140 yuan. However, due to the increased cost of coal mines, the price of coal in January increased to over 23,000 yuan per ton, but the price of electricity in this city was not increased. In March, the price of coal changed again to over 29,000 yuan, which is lower than the market price, but the income and expenses of various companies cannot be offset, and losses are increasing daily. The Shanghai Electric Power Company loses 800 million yuan per month, the French Electric Light Company loses 140 million yuan per month, and the Chinese Three Electric Power Company also loses 130 million yuan per month. Therefore, considering the actual situation, in accordance with the method of increasing the surcharge approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, a coal jin surcharge of 26 yuan per kilowatt-hour will be added to each level of electricity consumption, that is, the price of electricity for small users will increase from 24 yuan to 50 yuan per kilowatt-hour, in order to maintain the company's business. If the supply of coal is abundant and the price of coal is low, it should still be reduced. Furthermore, the power generation capacity of various companies in this city is limited by the amount of equipment, and it is already insufficient. It is hoped that citizens can make every effort to conserve electricity.</p>
<h3>Number of Senators to be Elected; 181 in the City; Election Scheduled for the 28th of This Month; Approximately 2.5 Million Voters</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The election of city senators in this city has been scheduled for the 28th of this month. According to regulations, the basic number of senators to be elected in the city's regional elections is 19. For every 30,000 people exceeding 100,000, one additional senator is added. The total population of this city is based on the statistics from the household registration survey in February of this year, totaling 3,345,875 people. Therefore, an additional 108 senators should be elected, for a total of 127 senators. The city senators to be elected by professional organizations account for three-tenths of the total number of senators, totaling 54 senators. Therefore, there are a total of 181 city senators in the entire region. The number of senators allocated to each electoral district in this city is determined in accordance with Article 9 of the City Senator Election Regulations, based on the proportion. That is, one senator is produced for every 26,345 people; the remainder is allocated to the districts with the largest fractional numbers in order. However, it is found that the national identity cards in the city have not yet been fully distributed. The municipal government has now decided to distribute the receipts for national identity cards as temporary substitutes before April 20th, which can be used to collect ballot papers in the future. It is estimated that there are approximately 2.5 million voters in the city, and more than half are expected to register to participate in the election. As of yesterday, a total of 1,189 candidates for public office had been</p>
<p>Successfully inspected. Among them, 1,039 are from various districts, and 150 are from professional organizations. Among the districts, Taishan District ranks first with 112 people, Huangpu District ranks second with 90 people, and Xincheng District ranks third with 84 people. Among the professional organizations, the Free Professionals Organization ranks first with 45 people, the Chamber of Commerce ranks second with 40 people, and the Labor Union ranks third with 36 people.</p>
<h3>To Send Food to Detained Han Traitors; Must Designate Yong'an and Sincere to Purchase</h3>
<p>The Temporary Detention Center of the High Court is specifically established for detaining Han traitors. Now, in order to pay attention to the health of the detainees, eight provisional measures have been formulated. The contents are excerpted as follows: "Hereafter, in addition to sending in clothes, which will still be handled according to the original regulations, if food is to be provided, a permit to purchase and send items to support detained criminals must first be obtained from this office and taken to Sincere and Yong'an Companies designated by this office for purchase (limited to canned goods, bread, and fruits). The companies will send the items directly to this office for delivery to the recipient. Family members of the detainees are not allowed to send in items themselves. In order to increase the detainees' exercise time, the cells will be opened three times a day in rotation, including one outdoor exercise and two indoor walks. However, if the age is over 60, or if the illness has been diagnosed by the physician of this office as requiring treatment, the chief of the detention center may extend the closing time as appropriate. Detainees who need beds may be allowed to prepare their own, but only No. 3 canvas beds are allowed. Family members or friends of the detainees may also send in a considerable amount of reserve funds, but it should be handed over to the custody section of this office for safekeeping. If the detainee needs necessary items, they may be purchased on their behalf after being reported to and approved by the chief of the detention center.</p>
<p>Beds Allowed</p>
<h3>Request to Temporarily Exempt from Demolishing Houses; Residents of Avenue Petain Petition</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council is Considering Remedial Measures</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] More than 400 households and shops along the Avenue Petain in this city are facing demolition by the Municipal Works Bureau, which urgently wants to dredge the riverbanks and has set a deadline of the 25th. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, more than 800 residents from the area, carrying paper flags, gathered to petition the municipal government, requesting exemption from demolition. As a result of discussions, it was provisionally agreed to use the bridge abutments on the riverbanks as the demarcation line. Houses that extend beyond the bridge abutments will be demolished, and the residents were asked to allow repairs. It is reported that the representatives have agreed to use the bridge abutments as the boundary. The bureau advised them to return to town and re-elect formal representatives to seek the opinions of all residents. A decision will be made again at 4:00 PM. However, the residents did not send representatives to talk in the afternoon. The petition group went to the Social Affairs Bureau around 3:00 PM to petition for a solution and relief measures.</p>
<p>The reporter specifically visited Director Zhu of the Structural Division of the Works Bureau. According to him, even if it is not possible to demolish all the houses, a tenth must be demolished. The bureau is seriously studying how to minimize the burden on residents and has asked the Social Affairs Bureau to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Pigments Stolen and Sold; Rong Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the former British-owned Rongfeng Yarn Factory has been under the management of the Japanese. After the victory, all the businesses of British and American factories were gradually recovered by their original owners. A few months ago, a certain British person in charge of the factory reported to the Municipal Police Bureau together with an official from the Enemy Property Handling Bureau, stating that a large number of pigments had been stolen and sold from the Rongfeng factory and requesting a strict investigation. Subsequently, a person named Zhang Rongshan surrendered to the police station and handed over part of the pigments. The police station detained him and transferred the confiscated items to the municipal government for safekeeping. After the interrogation was completed, the case was transferred to the District Procuratorate for review. It is reported that the District Procuratorate has allowed Zhang to be released on bail. It is understood that Zhang had spent two gold bars and 120,000 legal tender to purchase the pigments, which amounted to more than seventy-odd cards. The current estimated value is tens of thousands of legal tender.</p>
<h3>Former Italian Embassy in China Robbed of Valuable Treasures; Police Station Has Arrested Seven Thieves</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The Italian Ambassador to China, Dai Liangyi, resided at No. 149 Dunxin Road. On December 11, 1943, Dai and his wife were detained in a concentration camp by the Japanese army. At that time, they placed jade, antiques, silverware, and other items in boxes and hid them in the Italian Embassy on Nanjing West Road. Last winter, Dai Liangyi was released from the concentration camp and discovered the theft. He reported it to the police and requested an investigation. It is understood that the Municipal Police Bureau has successively arrested the principal offender and seven receivers of stolen goods and handed them over to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The principal offender, an Italian named Ferralli, confessed that he had previously worked as a gardener at the Italian Embassy and later as a sailor. He had successively stolen the above-mentioned items and sold them for use. After stealing fourteen antique jade items, Ferralli handed them over to an Italian dancer named Tama Ra and gave her 150,000 counterfeit currency. She accepted the stolen goods. Not long after, two accomplices, Italians Montoni and Manki, continued to steal the second batch of stolen goods and handed them over to Baoli Tai and Mario for sale. They then sold some of the silverware to Lao Tianbao Silver Shop through a Chinese named Hu Jianzhu (manager of the United Company at No. 1251 Jing'an Temple Road). A part of the antiques was sold by Mario to another Italian, Galinasi, who sold them to Baocheng Shop. It is understood that the stolen antiques and jade items lost by Dai are rare treasures worth a lot of money.</p>
<h3>Defendant's Lawyer Smiles with Joy; Japanese War Criminals in the Murder of American Pilots Case Sentenced; Lieutenant General Sawada Shigeru Chews Gum and Leads the Bow to the Judges in Gratitude</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The four Japanese war criminals who murdered three American Doolittle pilots and were tried by the US Military War Crimes Tribunal for several weeks were sentenced at 2:00 PM yesterday in the US military court at Ward Road Jail. The presiding judge, Reynolds, read out the verdict. Former Commander of the 13th Division of the Army stationed in Shanghai, Lieutenant General Sawada Shigeru, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Former director of the Shanghai Jiangwan Prisoner-of-War Camp, Captain Wakou Isamu, was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment. Former Japanese military court officials, Lieutenant Okada Ryuhei and Second Lieutenant Tate Hiyakitsuro, were both sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Except for Tate Hiyakitsuro, the four war criminals appeared very calm after listening to the verdict. Sawada Shigeru even chewed gum. All were overjoyed, as they did not initially expect to receive such light sentences. Sawada Shigeru bent over and led his colleagues in a deep bow to the judges before smiling and retreating. Afterwards, the defendants' defense lawyers repeatedly thanked the court and expressed their gratitude. One of the defendant's defense lawyers even smiled with joy. In August 1942, under the leadership of Sawada Shigeru, the military court sentenced three American pilots, Lieutenant Homar, Lieutenant Farrow, and Sergeant Spatz, to death, and also tortured Lieutenant Hadder, Lieutenant Barr, Lieutenant Nelson, Major Meidell, and Sergeant Ditscher and sentenced them to life imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Police Garrison Command Strictly Investigates Disturbances Caused by Military Personnel</h3>

<h3>Poverty, Hunger, Famine, and Pestilence: Jiangxi on the Brink of Disaster. The People are Shouting in Desperation for a Way to Live.</h3>
<p>— South Nanchang Dispatch, April 1, by Li Guohua</p>
<p>The war has been over for half a year, and most of the enemy troops within Jiangxi have been sent out of the country. However, this Yu Cao Plain, ravaged by the invading army for seven years, is now facing another, even more terrifying enemy: the widespread poverty, hunger, famine, and pestilence that plague the entire province.</p>
<p>Rapidly Rising Grain Prices: A Sixty-Year-Old Woman Eats Vegetable Roots</p>
<p>Let's take Nanchang City as an example: Since the victory, prices have been soaring, especially the price of grain, which has taken the lead. In six months, it has increased twentyfold, from 1,200 yuan per shi of rice to over 25,000 yuan today. The black market price is even 30,000 yuan, and it is still rising! The people in the occupied areas and the displaced refugees have suffered from the oppression and plunder of the enemy, and they have no grain left in their homes. They cannot even find a piece of broken cotton clothing to keep warm, and they huddle in the broken walls and weeds, suffering from the cold wind and rain of spring! How can they afford even a sheng and a half of rice to fill their stomachs? They can only dig up tree roots and grass to cook and barely survive. During the last days of the lunar year, the Provincial Winter Relief Association distributed relief rice. One group encountered an old woman in her sixties, Liu Zhao, living in a dilapidated house at No. 7 Fenghuang Slope in the city, cooking tree roots. The relief workers immediately tasted the sliced and boiled tree roots. They were tasteless and hard, difficult to swallow, and left a bitter, uncomfortable feeling in the stomach! But in Nanchang City alone, there are about 20,000 impoverished and helpless people who use these bitter, hard-to-swallow tree roots as their food to prolong their lives!</p>
<p>Everything is Gone: Spring Famine Closely Follows</p>
<p>Nanchang is still a large city in Jiangxi! What is the situation in other disaster-stricken counties? For example, Gaoan, Dean, Fengxin, and Shanggao in western Jiangxi were all prosperous counties before the war. Now, in many places, there are no signs of human habitation for dozens of miles, and three to four million mu of land are barren. The draft cattle in the rural areas have all been slaughtered, and even the rice seeds that were left for planting were looted by the retreating enemy last autumn. Batch after batch of refugees return to their ruined homes, with nothing to eat, nowhere to live, and facing weed-filled wastelands. The draft cattle, plows, and seeds are all gone. How can they reclaim the land? How can they cultivate it? At the same time, pestilence takes the opportunity to invade this group of hungry and suffering people, snatching away their remaining lives!</p>
<p>In the Pingxiang area of western Jiangxi, the great illness of seven years has not yet slightly healed, and last year they suffered a drought unseen for decades. The early rice harvest was nil, and the late rice harvest averaged less than 30% for the entire county. The Pingxiang area has always been a grain-deficient county. Even in a year of full harvest, they would still be short of three months' worth of grain. How can the people of western Jiangxi withstand such devastation, with enemy disasters and natural disasters striking one after another! Judging from the current situation, a severe spring famine is likely to follow the drought this year!</p>
<p>Due to the retreat of enemy troops along both banks of the Gan River in Guangdong province last spring and summer, the counties in southern and central Jiangxi suffered even greater losses. In particular, in the three counties of San'nan on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi, the enemy implemented a planned policy of burning, killing, and looting. Everything they could not take away was burned. The draft cattle and livestock were slaughtered, and even the fish in the ponds were killed with lime. The major market towns along both banks of the Gan River, such as Sanqu Tan and Xiajiang in Wan'an, Taihe, Ji'an, Jishui counties, as well as Xingan, Zhangshu, Fengcheng, and Shiwu, were all severely destroyed. In particular, only a few buildings remained in the cities of Wan'an and Xiajiang counties. The fields were filled with human corpses and cattle hooves. From Fengcheng down to Nanchang, nine out of ten houses on both sides of the river were destroyed, and Shiwu was completely burned to the ground. The severity of the disaster can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The Black Hand of the Plague Spreads from Eastern Jiangxi</p>
<p>After the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line battles of 1942, the counties in eastern Jiangxi suffered greatly from the enemy's devastation. In the past two years, the local vitality has not yet recovered, but the plague, which is even more terrifying than war, is quietly spreading in this area. This "Black Death," capable of killing thousands upon thousands, spread from Guangze to Nancheng in the winter of 1942. It is said that during the peak of the epidemic, the dead could not even buy coffins, and some infected families even perished together.</p>
<p>Disease and germs have always accompanied the god of war. After the war, the plague in eastern Jiangxi naturally accelerated its spread, preying on the impoverished people. Therefore, the plague in Nancheng re-emerged in October last year, even more rampant than in the early summer of last year. The epidemic area has expanded to more than sixty or seventy li outside the four villages. At the same time, two types of plague cases were discovered: pneumonic plague and meningitic plague. According to Professor Liu Nanshan of Zhongzheng Medical College, these two types of plague are transmitted through the air, and their rate of spread and mortality are more than twice that of ordinary plague. For example, when someone in Nancheng died of the plague, relatives and friends who came to mourn were infected and died after returning home. Later, even the coffin carriers who carried the deceased's coffin were infected. Also, a certain country squire in Zhuliang Township thought that the plague was caused by demons, so he cast out demons. But within a few days, Zhuliang Township was affected by the plague, with as many as ninety-nine patients. Stories of rampant plague like this have become very common in the besieged city.</p>
<p>This spring, the black hand of the plague has reached Nanfeng! The first discovery was in a household at No. 1 Liushuxia outside the north gate of the county. Two dead rats were first discovered, and later relatives from the countryside brought a one-year-old boy and a ten-year-old girl as guests. The boy suddenly fell ill and died two days later. The girl became ill one day after the boy's illness and died two days later. The symptoms were all blackening of the body, tearing, and runny nose without coughing. Then, Yuan Hu, a woman living at No. 1 Chengxia outside the north gate, also suddenly developed a high fever, headache, conjunctival congestion, and lethargy. She was treated that evening by the director of the Nanfeng Health Institute and the captain of the Jiangxi Epidemic Prevention Third Team, but the next morning, swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin on both sides was discovered. Her complexion was cyanotic, and she coughed and vomited before dying that night. A dead rat was found under the bed after her death. According to the neighbors of this woman, they had seen four dead rats the day before she fell ill, and one rat went out to drink water during the day and died immediately. Up to the beginning of this month, although no new patients have been discovered, dead rats have been found every day and have spread to Zhonghua East Road in the city.</p>
<p>Contagious Diseases: There is a Risk of Outbreaks Everywhere</p>
<p>Nancheng and Nanfeng counties are geographically the center of eastern Jiangxi and an important town in the Min-Gan junction area. Nancheng is only 160 li away from Nanchang to the north. After the war, refugees from Ganbei (northern Jiangxi) and other provinces in the Gan Dongnan (southeast Jiangxi) area all passed through here on their way back home. If strict precautions are not taken, the plague will be transmitted to various places by the movement of refugees. Therefore, the spread of this epidemic is no longer just a serious problem in one corner of Jiangxi!</p>
<p>In addition to the terrifying plague, other types of prevalent infectious diseases are breaking out everywhere. This spring, meningitis broke out in Juyin Pit, an important market town in Yudu. In less than a month, more than fifty villagers died. Cases have also been discovered in Xingguo, Yongxiu, and Shicun and the urban area near Nanchang. Recently, the prevalence of measles and smallpox in Nanchang and Jiujiang can be said to have broken all previous records. The rampant epidemic is certainly a seed planted by the war. The enemy slaughtered people and livestock everywhere, and the rotting corpses are the best breeding ground for germs. In addition, the winter was unusually warm, and there has not been a heavy snowfall to this day. This abnormal climate has become a breeding ground for germs this year. According to doctors, the prevalent infectious diseases in Jiangxi this summer are bound to be much more serious than in previous years!</p>
<p>There is Nothing to Eat: Where Would Surplus Grain Come From?</p>
<p>"Severe war disaster!" "Rising prices!" "Epidemic prevalence!" News like this has occupied a considerable amount of space in Jiangxi newspapers almost every day for the past three months, and reports of representatives of public opinion organs in various counties appealing to the authorities for relief are even more numerous.</p>
<p>Whenever I meet these elders from the disaster areas, they mostly say with tears in their eyes: "There are no draft cattle! There are no seeds! Even the farming tools are gone! When we go back, everyone stares blankly at the ruins. There is nothing to eat, and they still want to requisition surplus grain. Alas! How are the common people supposed to live?"</p>
<p>Once, I met a gentleman from Xiajiang County who said: "After the enemy's intrusion, the population of Xiajiang is only more than 30,000, but the quota for requisitioning surplus grain is as high as 100,000 shi. According to the current population, even including infants, each person has to contribute three dan of grain. In reality, we don't even have enough to eat ourselves, so where would surplus grain come from!"</p>
<p>Heavy Apportionment: Petty Officials Urgently Demand Payment</p>
<p>In addition to the huge quota of two million shi of grain pressing on the shoulders of the starving people of Jiangxi, there are also blood-sucking worms sucking blood from the impoverished people. These blood-sucking worms are those unscrupulous local petty officials. I remember that Mr. Liu Wendao, representing the central government, came to Jiangxi to comfort the people a month ago. When he visited the rural towns near Nanchang and entered a small restaurant, a middle-aged woman was sitting at the counter, holding an infant who had not yet been weaned. After exchanging a few pleasantries, Mr. Liu asked about her living situation. She said, "My house was burned down by the Japanese army. Now I rent this small shop for two dan of grain a month, and my daily business is only about 1,000 yuan." She went on to say, "It's really not easy to make a living. At the same time, there are many apportionments, and the payment is urgently demanded. Since we came here a month ago, the Baojia (local security system) has apportioned more than 3,000 yuan." Mr. Liu hurriedly asked, "What kind of donations are they?" She said, "Every month, everyone, regardless of age, has to contribute three sheng of rice and 100 yuan. When it was the New Year (Gregorian calendar), each family was also assigned 200 yuan. There are also road repair fees and sanitation donations. Even this small child who has just turned one week old has to be assigned to repair roads. If he can't do it, he has to hire someone. For those of us who run restaurants, we also have to provide bedding for ten days every month. My family of four only has one bed. How can we spare it? If we don't, we have to pay a rental fee of 50 yuan per night to rent bedding to send it in." Mr. Liu asked, "Are there receipts for the apportioned donations?" She shook her head and said, "Never." Mr. Liu asked again, "What are these donations used for?" She repeatedly said, "I don't know."</p>
<p>And this is still a rural area less than twenty li away from Nanchang, the location of the provincial government!</p>

<h3>Promoting Peace with a World Language</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The human race is diverse, and there are many languages. When crossing from country A to country B, language barriers arise; various affairs often require the assistance of translators, which is very inconvenient. Especially at the beginning of the atomic age, international boundaries have been eliminated, so a common world language is necessary. If there is a common world language, one will not encounter language difficulties and various barriers when traveling around the world. Extending this further: if languages are connected, the world can become one family, and world peace will inevitably be more consolidated, and the cruel atomic war will inevitably be eliminated.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt said in a speech at a theater in London on January 26: "I intend to propose to the United Nations that schools all over the world should be forced to teach a common language for international use. Language barriers are the most likely to hinder world peace, so I hope that the United Nations can stipulate that children all over the world, in addition to learning their own national language, should also learn a world language."</p>
<p>She believes that "children all over the world should, in addition to learning their own national language, also learn a world language." This is an extremely alarming statement. If the whole world has a common language, then the "language barriers" that hinder peace can be completely eliminated. However, the current question is: what kind of "world language" should we learn? In the past, the language of diplomacy was French, and even all disputes in the text were based on French; while the language most widely used in the world is English, but these two languages ​​can only be called "diplomatic languages" and "international commercial languages," not universal and pure "world languages." Mrs. Roosevelt's so-called "world language" was not clearly pointed out. I think that if children all over the world must learn a world language to meet the needs of the times, then learning English or French is not enough to be called a "world language," because these two languages ​​still have their scope, and using English and French as "world languages" is inappropriate, because these two languages ​​still have "nationality," not "internationality" (universality), so they cannot be adopted as a universally used language.</p>
<p>Linguist Zamenhof examined the issue of a universal language for the world thirty years ago, promoting human culture and eliminating language barriers. After painstaking research, he finally invented a "world language" (Esperanto). This "world language" integrates the advantages of languages ​​from various countries, and has phonetic alphabets, vowels, consonants, words, grammar, composition, etc., which are simple and easy to learn, and does not contain the narrowness of some national languages. However, it has not been valued for decades, so its promotion has not been widespread. To this day, it still has not made much achievements, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>Of course, Chai's "World Language" may not be a perfect "World Language", but undoubtedly, today's world needs a "World Language" to promote human peace and avoid the most urgent opportunity for "Third Sacrifice" (Mrs. Luo's words). We hope that the United Nations organization will not neglect "World Language" when discussing "World Peace," because "World Language" is possible as a bridge for "World Peace."</p>

<h3>Starting with the Death of Xiao Bingzhang</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhaoran</p>
<p>Xiao Bingzhang, a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, is dead!</p>
<p>He was sick for three months, during which he only hired two doctors with lower consultation fees, which his wife paid for by selling her clothes. Later, his condition improved daily, and the doctor instructed him to eat more tonics, but due to financial constraints, he could not fulfill this wish and passed away! Before his death, he said to his wife: "There is no money at home now, and I don't need a shroud or coffin. You can just wrap me in a straw mat and bury me anywhere." After his death, the Provincial Government often sent people to his home to handle the funeral and allocated 2 million yuan for funeral expenses. On the day of the funeral, a public memorial ceremony was held, and the heads of all sectors of the provincial capital attended in person.</p>
<p>All in all, these things can be said to be: Xiao Bingzhang lived a very hard life, but after his death, he was given extreme honors.</p>
<p>Xiao Bingzhang has been engaged in revolution for forty years. He was honest and incorruptible, and it is certainly deserving that he received extreme honors after his death; but it cannot be said that his extremely hard life before his death was not a regret. Just imagine: if he had not "worried about food and shelter day and night," how could he have become sick from worry? If he had become sick and his condition had improved daily, and he had been able to follow the doctor's instructions to eat more tonics, how could he have been hopeless for recovery? Even if he had lived for a very short period after recovery, he always cherished time as if it were his life, and how many things could he have done for the country and the people? Therefore, it cannot be said that his extremely hard life before his death was not a regret; and it cannot be said that the extreme honors after his death were not a satire!</p>
<p>Xiao Bingzhang was a "good civil servant"! There are many problems with "bad civil servants" in the current society, and there are also many "good civil servants" like Xiao Bingzhang; Xiao Bingzhang is dead and cannot be saved. For the "good civil servants" like Xiao Bingzhang who have not died, I think we should treat them with reason when they die in the future, and we should also treat them with reason while they are alive. This should be done to "clean up officialdom," and it should also be done to cultivate the atmosphere of "life is aimed at service"!</p>

<h3>Without a Sense of Integrity</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiao</p>
<p>Every night when I come back from Xizang Road, I always see the four red characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, Shame" on the roof of the International Hotel; precisely because they are so high, I have already seen them from far away. Only after I immerse myself in Hankou Road do I no longer see them.</p>
<p>Recently, I don't know why, the neon tube of the "Integrity" character has broken the " 겸 (jian)" inside, leaving only the outer shell "产" of the "Integrity (廉lian)" character still glowing. When I first discovered this changed "Integrity" character, I thought it was just a temporary breakdown and that someone would definitely repair it, but what I saw the next night was still "Propriety, Justice, Shame" and the "Integrity" character with only half of its outer shell lit.</p>
<p>The third day, the fourth day, ... until a moment ago before I wrote this article, this broken "Integrity" character seems to have not been noticed by anyone; I feel a little inexplicable disappointment.</p>
<p>If the International Hotel roof only had the three characters "Propriety, Justice, Shame" from the beginning, then passers-by would have known that it did not have "Integrity"; or if the entire "Integrity" character was broken, then we could see that there is no "Integrity" now! Unfortunately, there is half of the outer shell of "Integrity," but there is no inner heart of "Integrity."</p>

<h3>China's Friend – Donald</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zuozhen</p>
<p>"He is really an extraordinary person," said the famous writer John Kinsey. Indeed, Mr. Donald is a great figure who turned the tide of Chinese history with his own hands. His profound writing awakened the Chinese people; in the Xi'an Incident in December 1936, he influenced the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang, safely rescued Chairman Chiang, and completed the unification of the country.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's diary contains the following passage: "People all think that Mr. Donald is a specially appointed consultant of the government. In fact, he helps China entirely as a friend. He has refused the most honorable positions several times."</p>
<p>Mr. Donald's personality is straightforward and unpretentious, and he hates fraud. Since he left his native Australia in 1902, he has been working in China. Because he loves China and hopes that it can be revived, he does not hesitate to travel repeatedly, so he and General Marshall are both known as great "go-betweens".</p>
<p>When he was young, he was proficient in riding, archery, and fishing, especially his horsemanship, which was admired by the northerners who were good at riding. Golf occupied most of his daily leisure time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Donald developed lung cancer, "May the medical community create another miracle and let him recover as soon as possible." The Chinese people unanimously wish him well.</p>

<h3>Culture and Education</h3>
<p>Feng Bian-dai asks: Please provide detailed instructions on the following: (1) How many normal schools, either registered with or established by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, are there in the Shanghai urban or rural areas? (2) Which is the most historical normal school and where is its address? (3) Now that tuition fees for municipal primary and secondary schools are waived, are tuition fees also waived for normal schools? (4) What level of junior high school education is required for transfer students entering the third year of normal school? Is there a requirement to serve in schools for one year after graduation? (5) What are the differences between the textbooks used in normal schools and junior high schools?</p>
<p>Zhang Yi-qu answers: (1) There are only two normal schools in the Shanghai urban area: (A) Shanghai Municipal Xinlu Normal School, co-educational. (B) Shanghai Municipal Kindergarten Normal School, exclusively for female students. (2) There is currently no "most historical" normal school in the Shanghai urban area. Perhaps Xinlu Normal School can be considered an old school. It was originally located in Xinlu, Pudong, and is now located at No. 86 Bazilu Road. (3) Normal schools not only waive tuition fees like municipal primary and secondary schools, but also provide meal allowances and dormitory accommodation. (4) Transfer students entering the third year of normal school are limited to those who have completed the second year of normal school. It is unlikely that students with only a junior high school education can pass the transfer exam. (5) Normal school courses are completely different from junior high school courses, so the compilation of textbooks is also completely different. Please review the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education to learn about the differences.</p>
<p>Zhang Si-da asks: I have a friend who loves art and intends to study in Shanghai. I only know that there is the Shanghai Art College on Caishi Road, but I do not know where the former Xinhua Art College has moved to. Are there any other art schools in Shanghai? I hope you can spare some time to provide detailed addresses. Thank you!</p>
<p>Editor answers: There is currently only one art college in Shanghai, the Shanghai Art College. The Xinhua Art College was closed after the August 13th Incident [Battle of Shanghai] and there has been no news of its re-establishment.</p>
<h3>Tracking Down Missing Persons</h3>
<p>Searching for Husband Li Dengwen: Style name Ruo-ying, from Suzhou, forty-one years old. In the summer of the thirty-first year [1942], he was arrested by enemy [Japanese] military police for participating in the war of resistance. He was transferred to the enemy military police in Nanjing. At the time, there were reports from home stating that his life was not in danger, but that he would be drafted and sent to the Vietnam area soon. Since then, news has been cut off. Any comrades who know whether he is alive or dead are requested to send a letter with gratitude. (Li Zhang Hui-yu, No. 21, Dongdayuan, Qianjia Lane, Suzhou)</p>
