<h3 id="c1">召開國已大會問題政府代表提出意見 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十七日電〕政協會議於十七日下午三時，舉行第七次會議，討論國民大會問題。政府代表孫科等八人，提出關於國民大會之意見，由張厲生氏說明。章伯鈞，鄧頴超，張東蓀，吳玉章，張君勱，曾琦，王雲五，錢新之，邵從恩，胡霖，郭沫若，傳斯年，邵力子諸氏，相繼發言，均付交分組委會歸納協商。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十七日電〕政治協商會議今日開會，政府與共產黨代表，對五月五日召開國民大會，以便結束訓政，實施憲政之各項建議，意見不能一致。其後，共產黨正式提出建國程序十點。張厲生代表政府稱：渠希望召集國民大會，結束一黨專政，以便還政於民，不再予以遷延，並要求第二屆國民大會在六個月召集內，俾通過憲法，大會代表應根據憲法選出。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十六日電〕張申府於大會中，曾謂黨把中國害苦了。邵力子以和祥語氣起立致辭，首指出當前人民生活困苦，國步艱難，本黨固知努力不够，然無本黨同盟會之組織，滿淸不能推翻；無本黨之改組與北伐，北洋軍閥不能掃除，全國不能統一。八年抗戰中，若無本黨之領導，勝利必不能得到，今日國家更不堪設想，豈能作顚倒黑白之曲解，全盤抹殺本黨之業績，應請大家說句公道話。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十七日電〕政治協商會議第八次會議，定十八日上午九時舉行，議題爲憲草問題。又政協會分紙委會施政綱領組，定十七日上午九時，假國防最高委會開會，政府組織組，於上午十時，假參政會開會。</p>
<p>三人小組商談改編共黨軍隊</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶十七日電〕關於軍事三人小組會議，政府方面，經蔣委員長指派張部長治中·張主席羣，爲軍委會代表後，已與共產黨代表周恩來，於十五日下午四時，在張部長私邸，開始會談，就共產黨軍隊改編問題，作初步廣泛的討論。惟因張部長微感不適，遵醫囑靜養一二日後，即續作具體商談。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十六日電〕關於今後軍隊數目，靑年黨主張本年減至一百廿師，明年減至六十師。民主同盟主張應減至可能之最大限度。林蔚報告政府計劃，本年度即減至九十師，曾琦表示欣慰，但周恩來則以爲此龐大數目之裁撒，恐非易事，對中共則依雙十商談紀要，至少保留二十　。並謂，須待全國整編完畢，憲政全部實現後，該軍始可調動。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十六日電〕六次會討論靑年黨民主同盟有關軍隊國家化提案，陳啓天·梁漱溟，分別講述原案後，主席請軍政部林蔚報告國軍整編計劃，及實施經過。去年度國軍改編三分之一，並將繼續改編。張羣報告三人小組開始工作，商討中共軍隊辦法，力求軍隊國家化之實現況，並說明國民黨退出軍隊。周恩來亦贊成黨軍分離，使原提案失其意義，故討論僅限枝節問題。曾琦特表欣慰稱：軍事間題如獲解決，政治問題亦可解決。政治問題解決，則政治必可上軌道，本會前途大可樂觀，國家前途光明無限。</p>
<h3 id="c2">張厲生口頭說明　本年五月五日必如期舉行　制憲并決定憲法旅行日期　已選出代表外再合理增加 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十七日電〕政治協商會議第七次會議中，張會員厲生，說明政府代表所提「關於國民大會之意見如下：主席，諸位會員先生。今天的議程是討論國民大會問題，政府幾位代表，所提出的四項意見，文字相當簡單故在若干意義方面，想提出口頭報告，藉供大會協商之參考。</p>
<p>（一）民國三十五年五月五日，召開國民大會，我們國父倡導以三民主義來建國，而建國程序以「　政時期」一個階段最爲重要。但「訓政」時是中國國民黨根據的法，受了人民付託，行使政權。過去若干年中，政府以及執政的國民黨，很想能够將訓政時期應做的工作，即地方自治，早日完成，然後把政權還給人民，無如在訓政的過程中，國家多故，經過不少挫折，近八九年來，更遭遇空前國難，以致在二十六年決定召開之國民大會，此時開始了抗戰，全國上下爲要爭取民族生存，爭取抗戰勝利，不能不將召開國民大會延緩下來。所幸八年中，雖經過很多艱險，終能得到最後勝利，應歸功於全國國民，與前綫武裝將士的一致犧牲戮力。若溯其根本致勝之要素，仍賴有堅苦卓絕，不屈不撓的偉大領袖之領導。今天抗戰勝利了，國民政府成立亦將近二十年了，全國國民對於國父創造的三民主義，已經有了普遍的認識，深切的信仰，且國家已得到了獨立自由平等。不過有了獨立自由平等的地位，還需要全國國民發奮自强，有保障獨立自由平等的力量，才可屹立於世界。政府有鑒於此，要把政權迅速還給人民，將今後建設國家的責任，放在全體人民身上，所以本年五月五日，必須召開國民會議。</p>
<p>（二）第一屆國民大會之職權，爲制定憲法。這一屆國民大會的職權，爲制定憲法，並決定憲法施行日期，我們也有所說明。五權憲法中之國民大會，是國家最高政權機關，國民大會代表，對中央政治有實行選舉，罷免，創制，複決之權。這一屆國民大會的職權，僅是制定憲法，就是說，這一屈國民大會不是行使憲法上規定之職權。換言之，即不能選舉政府官吏，及行政罷免創制複決三權。從訓政到憲政開始的階段，我們覺得應該如此。</p>
<p>（三）第一屆國民大會代表，除已選出者外，其餘名額，可使之合理增加。除了已選出的代表以外，其餘代表名額，可使之合理增加的理由，是因爲我們經過八年餘之抗戰，全國上下各界人士，對於政治經驗，今後建設國家之途徑，都具有了深切認識，迫切的要求，故這屆國民大會，應該集思廣益，更多的容納各界有能力有見識，對國家有熱誠的人士，在這次國民大會裘，能貢獻他們更多的能力。</p>
<p>（四）第二屆國民大會，於憲法頒布六個月內，依憲法之規定，選舉召集之。所謂第二屆國民大會，是指在本年五月五日召集國民大會，制定和宣布憲法所規定的那個國民大會，希望在六個月內，依照憲法的規定，選舉召集之。這一點，須要特別加以說明。我們知道社會上有一種見解，對於第一屆國民大會代表有效無效的問題，有很多意見。有些見解，以爲第一屆已經選出的國民大會代表，應該重選。道種見解，我們政府以及執政的黨，也很重視，也曾經加以考慮，但是我們考慮的結果，對於過去已經依法　出的代表，沒有理由不承認他的代表資格。原因有二：一是根據法理上來講，二是根據情理以及現在政治情勢來講。先從第一點來說，我們在法律上，找不出根據來。我們看民國廿六年五月廿一日修正公布的國民大會組織法，有兩條條文，第一條是國民大會制定憲法，幷決定憲法施行日期。第十一條是國民大會於會期完畢任務終了。根據這兩條規定，國民大會的職權，是制定憲法，幷決定憲法施行日期。國民大會代表，就祗有這種任務，沒有任期。這種任務，政府沒有法律根據，可以解除他。再從第二點來講，以現在政治上一般趨勢來看，目前國家所希求的是團結統一，從團結統一來求得國家的安定。我們在座諸位先生，也是爲求團結統一國家安定而來開協商會議。假定說過去已經依法選出的九百幾十位代表，政府或任何方面不承認他們的代表資格，從新選舉，請問這幾百位代表心理上作何感想，作何反應，須知這些代表們，是由各地方各職業團體中選舉出來的，我們不能說他們不是代表多數人民的意思。如果我們一定要勉强不承認，那麼今天我們認爲各黨派在過去彼此對於政治主張見解，未能完全一致，尚且要苦心孤詣，由政府來召集政治協商會議，然則這九百幾十位的代表資格，或是否認，或是取消，他們是不是也要另外組織一個團體。假定例如組織一個國民大會黨，同樣像其他黨派，向政府表示他的意見和願望，再來開一個，甚至幾個協商會議，政府將何以處理。所以政府對於在法律上旣無根據，在情理上在今日政治情勢上，不能不加以考慮。對於過去已經選出的代表，無法不承認，而且因爲社會上有那種見解。所以在第四項採取一個折衷辦法，規定在第一屆國民大會任務完畢之後六個月內，依照將來制定的憲法，召集第二屆國民大會，這第二屆國民大會代表。當然無異議的要實行普選，而他的職權，就可以對於中央政府行使選舉權，罷免權，創制權，複決權。以上是我們對於國民大會提出四項意見的師單說明，至於闕民大會代表如何合理增加，如何增加方法，增加多少，才是合理，這一點，政府方面沒有成見想提出本會議，聽取各位先生的意見，然後再作協商。此外，我們沒有想到的若千問題，很希望諸位先生儘量貢獻意見，以利協商。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕大連市長沈怡，今日下午四時，乘中航機返平，因此間事務待理，十七日勾留一日，改定十八日偕接收人員飛長春，轉赴任所，沈對東北局勢，頗抱樂觀，但對大連接收，則認爲係一艱難之工作，因爲大連在外人統治下半個世紀，驟予接收，人才制度等，無不成問題。此次大連接收人員的二百名，較其他省市陣容，已見雄厚，惟實際仍不敷用多多。僅以敎育而論，如一單位派一人，即需百餘人之多，而制度上之困難，亦不遜於人才。如數十年來，該市一切皆以日文爲主，接收後積重難返之苦，與台灣當相類似。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕接收大連問題，中蘇己獲協議。張嘉璬自長春來電，催沈怡速往。沈今日可由靑島返平，定十七日飛長春。又孫越崎任經濟部東北特派員，今晨率工礦專家十餘人，專機飛長春。孫本人三五日即返平，處理在平未了事宜。其平津敵僞產業處理局局長職務，則暫由顧毓瑔兼代。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十七日廣播稱：聯合國機構安全理事會，今日在此舉行第一次會議，由澳洲代表弗萊塞任主席。英國代表培克發表演說，略謂：英國係一民主國家，在過去三十年中，為爭取人類之自由，曾作極大之努力與犧牲。在兩次大戰中，英人為正義而身殉不知凡幾，今者大戰已成過去，深盼大會能奠定此後世界和平之基礎。培克致詞畢，英首相艾德禮（即前　之阿特里）即趨前與其握手道賀。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕安全理事會定明日舉行首次會議。今日據伊朗代表恩德常宣稱，一俟安全理事會開會，該國即將請理事會解決伊朗與蘇聯間之爭端，並阻止紅軍繼續開入伊朗。聯合國機構安全理事會係由十一國組成，蘇聯係五常任理事之一，具有否決權。對於理事會任何決議，皆可阻其實行。此次伊朗案件，似為理事會權利首次所遏之試騐。伊朗代表團已於昨晚接到該國政府訓令，　向安全理事會申訴。外傳伊朗總理哈基米已辭職，據伊朗代表恩德常　，代表團未悉此事，惟總理若果辭職，聯合國大會伊代表團之地位，將全由本國新政府決定。此次向安全理事會申訴，係以保護伊朗領土完整與行政獨立，以抗蘇聯侵略之廣大原則為根據。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕據出席聯合國大會之代表透露：在伊朗代表執行本國政府之訓令，將亞塞爾拜然問題提交安全理事會以前，　於昨夜在會外作調解之最後嘗試。五十一國之多數代表，悉以伊朗問題為談話主題，然大會一般辯論，並未因之中斷。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕聯合社記者以伊朗問題叩問蘇聯各代表，　守緘默，僅答稱，「吾人不知有伊朗問題」。伊朗代表團則希望該國局勢能於會外取得「友誼的解決」，否則決定訴之於安全理事會。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦十七日電〕英外相貝文今日向大會宣稱：英國已着手初步談判，以便將非洲英國委任統治地丹加尼卡·吐谷闌·及喀麥隆三處，移歸聯合國代管，巴勒斯坦問題暫　處置，以待英美委員會調查後再行定奪。外約　或將實行獨立，故不能歸國際機構代管。貝文之演說，為今晨會議注意中心，會議旋即休會，以便下午舉行安全理事會議。</p>

<p>〔聯合社舊金山十六日電〕杜魯門總統聲明，美國由日本取得之太平洋戰略各島，在需要期間，仍將與以保留，惟所當保留者，究屬何島，則並未加以說明。據去年九月間美海軍當局提議，美國應保留者為琉球·琉璜·塞班·及猶寗等島。此外，並須保留威克島·中途島·伊尼威托克·卡瓦奇里與土魯克島等，以防他國利用云。</p>

<p>墨代表見解：五強應改稱大國</p>
<p>墨西哥駐法大使狄亞以英語發言，謂人民心中，仍有因原子能而引起之重大焦慮，英法美蘇中五國，不應稱為列強，祇應稱為大國。因現代交通便利，歐美兩洲已無分彼此，均為同一血統與觀念所聯繫，殖民地制度之觀念已不復存在，墨西哥今在安全理事會中佔有一席，決當會同其他各國，以反抗納粹法西斯主義之同樣決心，在正義原則內保障和平。</p>
<p>阿根廷自承：始終抱民主精神</p>
<p>阿根廷代表團長昆泰那發言，保證該國全力援助，使聯合國憲章付諸實施之任務。略稱，阿根廷始終深抱民主精神，並擁護人民自決原則。國際司法平等及不干涉主義，阿根廷曾承認三度重定其邊疆之仲裁，更曾就德方無限制潛艇戰事，宣佈戰事應照國際公法之基本原則進行。今聯合國召開會議，着手　　國際之和平與安全，重大責任乃降　各國。歐洲流血慘重，且糧食不足，決不能以自力更生。經濟社會理事會決定集體努力，從事世界上之物質善後工作。阿根廷　此決議，當可大予協助，以求其實現。</p>

<h3 id="c33">錦州苦寒記 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 聯合社記者十四發</p>
<p>東北　諸省降冬酷寒，但此間大旅館的休憩室中，仍有一盆盆靑翠的仙人棠和棕桐樹，點綫其間，見者或許詫爲異事。可是，無論在室內或戶外，已凍得人麻木不仁，因此連驚詫的感覺也難得發生。人們對於這些小事情，也許視若無諸。日本人在東北，經管了十四年，想一舉越過四千年的阻隔，幾乎已告成功。在錦州就有界限分明的兩個城市：一個是中闕的舊城，和蒙古草原上的旗人一樣悠遠：一個是簇新的「日本製造」的城市，它的街道房屋處處流露着日本情調，亮品晶的像一塊銀洋。</p>
<p>錦州　一向是軍家必爭之地，想入關直取中原，必先掌握錦州。在這裏，東北的騎兵曾和明朝的軍民發生激戰，因爲能够佔領錦州，就無異於控制了中原寳庫的門戶。日本人當然也看到了這一點，但反過來却未必有用。東北保安部隊，自去年十一月起，就佔領了這個人口十七萬的城市，等待上峯命令開入滯陽。這裹還留着三四萬日本人。他們雖然帶來了仙人掌，並在古城中加上新的光輝，都無濟於事。舊城裹，生活一切如常，只在新城的火車站，紡織廠，遼闊而舖雪的街道上，和工人住宅區有受過戰事洗禮的痕跡。此間除了幾個在寒風中顫抖着的記者外，更沒有別的美國人。最有美國意味的，只是一包包「駱駝牌」「吉十牌」香烟，由日本兒童或背負嬰兒的日本婦女，在街上時賣。有些日本女人仍舊剪着短髮，像男人一樣，據說這是因爲想躱避「羅宋人」的緣故。但是否有效，還沒有找到證據。</p>
<p>街道上，天一黑，就無行人，九點鐘開始宵禁，再也沒有人敢跑出門去。中國哨兵和別國的哨兵一樣，寗可先開槍，然後問話。澈夜守衛，絲毫不肯放鬆。記者曾在短短的二百碼中，兩次碰到哨兵的盤詰。由他的口氣，就可以知道他的認眞。一聽到這種呌聲，似乎便會使人不僵記者高聲答以「美國人」，聲言發抖，似乎該歸咎於零下二十度的低溫。杜將軍麾下這些南方兄弟們，眞不可輕視。</p>
<p>今天　早晨，有六個驚駭莫名的中國靑年，帶着手銬，牽過市街，兵士刺刀出鞘，押着他們。一個中國參謀軍官告訴記者：「這些是强盜，或許要槍斃。看他們犯罪情節的輕重，再完發落。」可知在錦州恣意劫掠的日子已經過去了。但在一二個月以前，情形就大不相向。那時內戰活躍，八路軍把橋　房屋炸毀後，凡破損的大厦，棧房，住宅，都被洗劫得乾乾凈凈。城裹，到現在，還留着恐懼的印象。</p>
<p>商店　大多數依舊關着大門所有營業，須俟東北流通券和法幣的比率規定以後，才能恢復。紡織廠也都停工，工人因此失業。但是錦州人是堅强不屈的，他們或許不會再把仙人掌一類的植物進口。新城不久會失去它的光輝和舊的混和起來。滯留了十四年的日本客人，終究要送回老家去。但這古老的商塲，仍將繼續過着它舊日的生活方式。征服者來來去去，在這裹的人民眼裏，幾百年來早已看慣了。</p>
<p>國軍　收復東北進行遲緩，據稱係由當局採取審愼態度，以免妨礙長春談判之故。中蘇軍隊迄未發生意外，即此審愼之結果。以營口而論，當國軍未開入之前，新民蘇聯某軍官曾向華方授意，謂營口地方重要，「你們中國軍隊何不加以佔領？」此項報告，傳至杜聿明司令部，闕軍二千名左右於是奉命向該處開拔，並即安然加以收復。</p>
<p>營口　先前，原爲多事之處，去年秋間，美國第七艦隊運輸國軍開往該處企圖登陸時，曾遭岸上共軍開槍射擊。迄至最近，蘇軍開放「綠燈」，國軍開往，共軍四千至一萬人，即作鳥獸散，其中若干，一度且避於城內蘇軍司令部。東北保安司令部聯絡員，曾往詢蘇軍司令何時離營口，據答稱：正待長賽馬林諾夫斯基命令云。可知新民蘇聯軍官之言，與長春方面之言，不盡符合。在此夾　之中，國軍行動自以審愼小心，餒格遵守中蘇協定爲佳也。（據非官方消息：共軍三千人，又已開回營口。）國軍何時可以進一步開入旅　大連或哈爾濱，尚未在長春方面商得同意。</p>
<p>此間　司令部發言人，仍望一俟蘇軍於下月五日全部撤退，東北各要邑均可完全收復。惟就目下遲緩情形觀之，此層不無可疑。即以長春而論，雖爲國軍最初開到之東北大城，但華方控制力不能謂已鞏固。此項國軍自北平空運開到者不過一千五百餘人，其中擔任東北九省主席衛隊之職者，且需一千人。〔聯合社錦州十四日電〕</p>
<p>「一貫道」宣傳小冊之一部分</p>
<h3 id="c34">顯微鏡下的日僞工具「一貫道」秘密史 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　邵慎之寄自南京</p>
<p>汪精衛僞政權在日寇卵冀下成長，它的政治理論的極端反動性，就很淸楚地反映到各個部門。它利用所謂帮會和所謂宗敎的活動來控制淪陷區的人民，把他們的生活思想拖到黑暗的中世紀，企圖把民族性奴化起來，墮入愚昧·麻木·迷信·無知的深淵·常逆玉淸的「中華安清聯合會」，李逆炳靑的「中華洪門聯合會」，都是有效地作爲罪惡統治的工具。記者所要特別指出的是「一貫道」的罪惡和它的恐怖性，最近四年來，它在汪精衛僞政權支持之下，與「安淸聯合會」狼狽爲奸，發展組織，散佈毒化思想，發生極嚴重的惡劣影響。而且顯然地，在担任着日偽的特務情報工作。</p>
<p>大本營　設在南京</p>
<p>「一貫道」的活動地區，包括華北各省以及蘇浙皖豫等省，總部設在南京，名崇華堂，分堂則另起堂名，在南京一市的分堂，就有三十多個。四年來對南京市民的組織工作，已進行至百分之七十。它的掩護烟幕是「宗敎」和「慈善事業」。他們曾一度在抗戰後方活動過，後經地方常局嚴厲取締，並几勒令自首，吾則加以逮捕，用這棵的行政命令鎭壓了下去。但是在淪陷區却繼續擴大組織。</p>
<p>汪精衛僞政權爲什麼盡力扶植「一貫道」？只要檢查一下它的「理論」根據，就可以明白。「一貫道」南京總堂崇華堂，董事長是褚逆民誼，董事是彭逆年，張逆祥夫，周逆學昌，李逆雲五，葛逆亮時等人。褚逆民誼在三十三年曾以「功德」款名義付給該堂四十五萬元。這是有文件可查的一宗。</p>
<p>一南道道統荒謬</p>
<p>「一貫道」的所謂理論，（包括「人生觀」和「教義」）是什麼呢？它必須要有這麼一套理論作為掩護，才能進行它的陰謀活動。站在宗敎的立塲上，它宣傳常敎（主要的是對正規的佛敎，回敎，基督敎所發動的攻勢）改歸「一貫道」。因此，它本身遂先建立一種混亂，荒謬，無恥，達到極點的敎義，集合反動，迷信，復古思想之大成。關於「一貫道」的沿革，謂「老子云：大道無形，生育天地，未有天地，即有此這，伏羲畫卦，大道降生，軒轅氏著陰符經，始蘭發妙旨，嗣後堯·舜·禹·湯·文·武·周公·接綾道統，心法相授，及於孔子，孔子曰：「吾道一以貫之」，曾子曰：「唯」於是傳至曾十，曾子繼傳子思，又傳孟子，後儒脉泯滅，幸西域釋教振興，釋迦傳二十八代而至達摩，達摩入中國，大道仍一脈相傳，是爲初祖，以後傳至淸虛十六祖，復道傳東魯，三敎合一，弓長祖出而繼之」簡直是胡說八這。　所調「弓長祖」究竟是誰呢？即是「一貫這」妄稱『師尊』的張天然。山東濟寗人，行踪靡定，和僞組織的大漢奸們往來甚密。南京總堂實際負責人，是他的兒子張毅，稱爲「道長」。此外組織中復有「點傳師」，即主持扶乩工作的。另外，有文書，交際，會計，總務等職司。「點傳師」人數很多，他們帶着十歲左右，受過特殊訓練的男女，兒童，到各地去設壇扶乩，稱爲「辦道」，扶乩就是他的宣傳毒化思想的基本工具。</p>
<p>他們供奉的神是「明明上帝無量淸虛至眞至聖三界十方萬靈眞宰」，立有牌位。但爲了簡省，創造了—一個「申」字來代替，猶如側寫的「母」字。或謂「無生老申」。一貫道宣傳品種數以及散發數量之多，一時無法統計。</p>
<p>宣傳品的印刷和紙張，都很精美。有一本「勸各敎徒歸正」的小冊，假託由「無生老申」命令「西天接引佛」，「鑒慈天尊先夭祖」，「回敎主謨罕默德」，「耶穌基督」降壇，寫出乩文，勸各敎徒改歸一貫這。它的陰謀，顯然是在破壞一般正規的宗敎文化，而拖入「一貫道」的極端反動的深淵中去，以期加强日僞的統治。</p>
<p>在「暫訂佛規」一冊中說：「歐風東來，祟尚科學，先王之綱常掃地，聖人之禮敎廢弛，故而戾氣漲　，陰陽乖舛，變亂相尋，災異業生，遂致釀成空前未有之浩劫，目下極天之厄運，前賢所謂劫由人造，理數使然，誠不誣也。」這完全是代日僞在淪陷區的殘酷虐殺作辯解的。又說：「自余（張天然自稱）修道以來，概不涉及政治，無非糾正人心，惟講仁說義，効法古聖先賢，祗論俎豆馨香而已。然自古道不輕傳，故恪遵關聖帝君壇諭，求道手續，稍取本人功道，以驗信道眞僞，乃藉微資，刷書印訓，抑或接待來往，周濟貧困，並無任何捐募規例」。一貫道究竟是怎麼一付嘴臉，這就相當淸楚了。記者所見的鉛印小冊，還有：「綱常倫理從德合編」「驚語指迷金箴」，「三敎圓通」，「覺路指南」，「化善靈丹」，「一貫道疑問解答」，「一貫道初學須知」，「道理淺言」，「貫道新介紹」，「三敎聖訓」，「一貫眞詮」，「混元布袋眞經」，「闡道要言」，「一貫修首須讀」，「一貫辯道錄」「申論修道五規」，「醒世指南」，「一貫佛母經」「一貫聖訓集」，「慈航金鑑」，「一貫坤道須讀」，「一貫道之人生規」，「達摩眞傳」，「增註大學白話解說』，「紫光同樂班顯化記」等，不下百餘種。</p>
<p>社會部以「一貫道」崇華堂係利用之宗敎團體，平日妖言惑衆，傷風敗俗，依法予以解散。並將建業路一八七號三茅宮九十九號的房屋器具，部令中華理敎會暫行保管，聽候處理。不過單是解散是不够的，這些主持份子必須加以逮捕審問，澈底肅淸毒化思想。我已經搜集的大量文件，足以證明他們的全部毒化活動！尤其可以注意的是，除開「一貫道」以外，還有所謂「天仙會』，「一心天道　華皇敎會」，「中華先天道」等等名目，雖在勝利後潛跡或予以解散，但是否是「一貫道」的外圍組織，很値得研究。</p>
<p>候輪近國的美女戰士花圈，候船啟程返美</p>
<p>入禁地大喫一驚</p>
<p>記者曾經由社會部專員徐霖陪同，到建鄴路一八七號參觀。這裏就是「一貫道」總堂所在，一向是秘密的禁地，經社會部予以解散之後，由部派保安警察看守着。我走到裘面，彷彿走進了「劍俠小說」中所描寫的魔窟。房屋建築是反向的，一共三進平房，中間用兩個庭院間隔着，進去的時候，必須走完一條長約五十公尺，兩旁夾着高牆的水門汀甬道，邊上種着參差不齊的矮冬靑，覺得有些陰氣森森。兩扇大門，是用鐵皮包起來的，釘着密密的鐵釘，我們按過門鈴之後，等等好久，保安警察才從裹面彎彎曲曲的走出來開門。</p>
<p>屋子裹面的陳設，不禁使我大吃一驚，所有的傢具，包括床。榻·几·凳·桌·無一都是用紅木細工制成，這樣奢侈的陳設，在南京這是第一次看到，尤其是那些銅鐘·古磁·玉磐，到處充斥，滿壁的大理石紅木屏條，富　堂泉的佛具，　棟　樑漆彩如花，實在不像是一個普通慈閃團體。聽說「一貫道」利用組織和僞組織的政治壓力，聚斂來的財產非常可觀，已經陸續給那些所謂道長點傳師之類移花接木，轉化為私產。三十多處分堂，現在社會部令理教會接管的僅僅兩處，就是一個個很好的說明。</p>
<p>當我走完甬道後，即向右轉。再向右就進入屋內。這時兩戶的門是開着的，門口有磚砌的圓柱，　大紅漆，門頂有「瓶升三戰」的圖案，門裏白照壁上，有一個大紅「福」字，躱在紫藤后面。在這里向左，就通過一個圓洞門，上面有紅底黑字篆書的眉匾，一面是「道義之門」，一面是「紫氣東來「進圓門，就是一個庭院，右面是走向供殿去的，左面是「一貫道」的診所。中間一座供殿，就供着神位，有一付對聯上寫着：「聖域　關十六字心傳皆歸一貫，新民明德千萬言敎義爲度羣生」。而後面一進，是「師尊」住的，就是入道的人也不能去，大漢奸方可進出。屋子大小一如供殿，但中間所供的不是什麼神位，而是張掛着四張屏條和一付對聯是康有爲寫的，好像專爲供奉這位保皇黨頭子的手蹟的，殿的左手是浴室厠所，右手是「師尊」住的。我在這兩處看到了秘密，在浴室的小桌子中間，我到大堆小學生所寫的乩文底稿。浴室內，陳設極爲精緻，有水汀設備。「師尊」的房裏藏着更多的古磁，銅器和玉器，雖然大多是贋品，但都是上好的東西。</p>
<p>樟木箱秘密發現</p>
<p>在一隻離有蟠龍的樟木箱裹，發現大批香水，香粉，以及衣料，還有許多新的女鞋和月經帶，並且發現一張僞組織警務機關發的電報底稿。尤其重要的，是署名「師璧」自北平寫給僞軍事委員孫逆祥夫的信的底稿，那上面寫着：</p>
<p>「……京滬親友，屢次敦請，余亦有意南遊，藉以得與先生等會面，罄叙闊別，實是余之素懷，祇以事多紛煩，未能早日成行，近來又加北方諸多事項，待余料理，無法南行，以待將來。余巳於本月廿三日抵平，一行均稱安吉。啓程之後，接到轉來大札，余甚欣慰，內云重行有榮任廣東要職之訊，先生顧及道務，將來諸多弗便，意思很好，然而事出政令，無可如何。重行約先生同去一事，先生之意不願隨行，固屬很好，然應此非常時局，更常識時達務耳。擬欲引陳上岸一節，可見賢契等籌劃週到，可與麗之商酌辦理爲盼。專此，時　！師　佈（四月廿三）。</p>
<p>由此可見「一貫道」和偽組織關係的一斑。</p>

<p>這幾天，美國陸軍運輸艦到達了美國船埠，軍樂隊往往會吹奏起「新娘來了」的曲子，而且遍數無定，這一點是可以原諒的，因爲有許許多多陸軍船隻以至於商船，近來都載到了一批批美國士兵的新娘。可是這樣一批批來的爲數還不足以滿足那些做丈夫的美國士兵，到目前爲止，到達美國的外國生新娘只一萬名，而士兵們在海外結婚的女郞有六萬名之多，至於訂了婚的更難於勝數。</p>
<p>新娘們來自美軍駐過的世界各地，但她們新到美國所遭遇的問題，倒是一樣的。她們都得適應這新世界的規矩與習俗，試想到海外成婚困難良多，而居然有那麼多人匹配良緣，確屬是驚人的事情。可是有一點，也許値得指出，即有些姻緣好事多磨，相當惱人。</p>

<p>自然，她們也想家，幾乎每一個都患嚴重的懷鄉病。不過有些新娘，已經做了母親或是懷了孕，那就因為另有所思，不怎麼想家了。</p>
<p>丈夫在外，而自己在城裏做工作的新娘中，有一個典型人物，她是生長倫敦的二十一歲美麗的路馬諾夫人，她曾是英國婦女農事服務隊（Women's　Land　Army）的隊員。</p>
<p>路夫人和他丈夫最初在英國埃蕯克斯郡頓摩地方一個「陣中酒店」中會面，她講起那段經過時說，「另一位美國兵和我的一位女朋友胡調，他和善地過來，制止了他，我們就這驟認識了。」</p>
<p>一九四四年四月，他們相識後一年，結婚了。婚後不久，一等兵路馬諾調往法國與德國。路夫人從此就沒有見過他。她現在已在紐的一家銀行裏當書記，她喜歡住在美國。　另一位更加美國化的是卡尼夫人，以前是英國諾丁漢郡二十五歲的蘭麗克小姐，卡尼夫人曾在一家兵工廠內工作，講「美國話」，大讀美國一支別號「布洛克林掘壕者」的步兵隊，她說：「我一點也不愛國，不過獨愛美闕步兵。』</p>
<h3 id="c37">我一點不愛國　獨愛美兵 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>另一位公事房工作者是芮尼夫人，以前是英國任爾威區郡的許絲小姐。芮尼夫人二十四歲，曾在英國空軍部工作，一九四三年一次空襲中與美兵芮尼在倫敦防空壕中相識。</p>
<p>海外新娘中一大部分，約百分之九十，來自英倫三島與紐西蘭的安第波地斯，可是她們並不一定最容易美國化二等兵普勒契夫十九歲的妻子蘇麗亞，眼若秋波，過去有幾年的生活完全在沙漠戰爭中度過，她是北非突尼斯的漢姆里夫的居民，對納粹很淸楚，因爲納粹曾在她家附近的一個村菲裹有六個月，有時作戰有時玩，她說，但是後來因爲「他們正如你們所說的令人討厭一我就再也不想着他們了。</p>
<h3 id="c38">四萬美國丈夫先鵠候新娘 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>普勒契夫夫人正像大多數大兵夫人一樣說，和丈夫「在一次晚會上相識。」她唯一遺憾的事情是他法國話說得非常好，使她沒有機會學好英語，雖然她承認常常想家，打算戰事平定後去突尼西亞一次，她對於美國人也什麼都愛好，她總括她的印象說：「美國，我很喜歡，女人個個和氣。男人我很歡喜。」</p>
<p>軍官們的外國太太收入比較豐裕，因此問題比較少。</p>
<p>戰事結束後，最大的問題是如何令大批海外新娘隨她們的丈夫到美國。現在美國就有四萬個丈夫在鵠候他們的新娘。</p>
<p>由於復員加緊，首先要運送出征海外的軍人，因此軍人眷屬的運送，更成了問題。美國陸軍，國務院和國會，此刻正考慮新辦法俾使新娘們快點到美國來。（美譯自十二月十五日「洋客」雜誌）</p>

<h3 id="c40">收復區金融復員問題 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 盛慕傑</p>
<p>目前收復區各城市的金融復員，有四個校大的問題，急待解次：</p>
<p>一，是行莊復業問題。在上海，金融雖然一度山混亂而停頓，由淸理而復員，但工商各業尚無因此感受痛苦。然在內地各城市，則深切地感到金融停頓的不便。任何物品的買賣，均須以現鈔爲交易的媒介。因爲在戰前各城市的金融機關，不外乎錢莊，商業銀行和國家銀行的分支行，戰時均經分別裁撤。其新設的行莊，均是向僞組織登記的。勝利以來，一律依法淸理。然當地戰前錢莊，大都收歇，現在毫無復員的趨勢，而原有有的國家銀行和商業銀行的分支行，迄今亦遲遲未曾復業。不但當地工商業惑受資金不能融通，即異地的資金亦感到無法溝通。</p>
<p>造成現在各城市金融停頓的最大原因，是國家銀行僅着眼於幾個大都市，而對於各城市則比較忽略；商業銀行雖急於要在各城市恢復其原有的分支行，但因向財政部申請手續的轉折，郵遞的遲緩，以致商業銀行分支行的負責人員至今祗好整裝待發。明知當地工商業對行莊復業期望甚殷，但格於法定手續，亦苦無能爲力。</p>
<p>二，是僞幣收兌問題。無可否認的，僞幣收兌工作進展的遲緩，實在急應糾正。在上海，最初收兌僞幣工作只是委之於中、中、交、農四行，及中央信託、郵政儲滙兩局，其後經添加政府關係之小四行，復經各界呼籲，始增設收兌處，而由繼續營業各行莊辦理代兌工作。然而兩個多月來，上海市仍有大量僞幣之存在及流通。至於內地各城市，則更依然是僞幣的世界。固然，工商各業記賬的單位是一律改爲法幣了，但法幣標價，和僞幣呌價，無形中幾成爲商人或一般人的習慣。今日在各城市的交易，盡是以僞幣爲媒介，一疋布的買賣，一件紗的成交，僞幣成捆的像草紙挑來挑去！</p>
<p>或問：難道各城市沒有收兌僞幣的機構嗎？有！祗有唯一收兌僞幣的郵政局，或至多另有一個省銀行的分支行辦事處。因爲這種機構在其本身上並不是一個專鬥從事收兌僞幣的機關，不過兼理性質，如何能積極展開收兌工作？而且收兌時，商人或人民須將僞劵的面額和版式分別歸類，積有成數，才可去兌換法幣，遠不如在市塲上推來推去的便當，又如何能產生大量收兌的効果？因此，僞幣自然仍能泛濫於市塲，而將來一且截止收兌，人民必呌苦運天了！</p>
<p>三，是抑低利率問題。在戰前，利率的在一分至一分半之間，即月息千分之十至千分之十五，即年息百分之十二至百分之十八。當時若是超過年息百分之二十，已經認爲是高利貸了。及在戰時物價飛漲的情況之下，經營商業的利潤非常之高，無形中債權者對於債務者所要求的利率也逐步提高，債務者因商業利潤的優厚，也不吝高利借貸：因此影響到金融機關，如非比例的提高存款利率，便無從吸收社會上的游資。當然，水漲船高，金融機關的放款利率也必倍增於存款利率。所以利率的趨勢，從月息千分之二十，盤高到千分之二百。以上海論，一部份行莊雖名義利率爲千分之二百，但因預扣利息，也合到千分之二百五十（即俗稱大二分半）。現在上海的利率是傾向盤低了，大的月息千分之八十左右，而內地各城市的利率還是很高。</p>
<p>在過去，各城市的利率，較之上海還要高出二三倍。聽聽利率不過是千分之二百或千分之一百五十，似乎比較上海還低，但在實際上已不是按月計算，而是按每十天計算，要合到月息千分之四百五十至六百之多！勝利之後，因爲敵僞統制的摒除，交通運輸的團滑，投機團積的無利，物價趨勢的傾下，利率也逐漸回小，然較之戰前，仍屬高昂，即較現在仍站高峯的上海利率，也還超過甚多。更因金融機關復員的少，資金融通困難，利率的高低亦不一致，現在大的在千分之一百至一百五十左右。工商業因利率的穩站高峯，對於正當的經濟活動，乃不敢放手去做。</p>
<p>四，是停業行莊問題。如前所述，各城市在戰時的金融機關，旣全是向僞組織登記的，現在依法停業淸理，當然是毫無問題了。可是目前當地原有錢莊和國家銀行及商業銀行分支行辦事處未甘復業，靑黃不接，而停業淸理的行莊，好像前途有一錢曙光，乘機一方面淸理，一方因暗中做做票貼，往來放款。一切的一切，是有憑有據，而在法理上是無憑無據。他們以爲偷偷摸摸的做，何如取得保障或取得合法地位的去做？於是在種種藉口（確有理由）之下，有紛起要求復業或重新設立的趨勢。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可知今日各城市金融復員的間題雖有四個，而其根本的解次，還在合法行莊的趕速復業。因爲合法行莊的缺乏，使得僞幣的收兌工作不能展開，工商資金無從週轉，市塲利率難以抑低，淸理行莊紛起要求。並且因金融的停滯，又影饗到經濟各部鬥也不能加速復員，轉向平時的經濟發展。現在財政金融當局似乎太注重都市金融的復員，而忘記了都市外圍的各城市金融的復員。現在收復區各城市的畸形現象，財政金融當局實應從速糾正過來。</p>

<p>烚赤昨以傳說本期赤金儲一畜劵，到期停止付現，改以結價了結之訊，引起各種揣測，證劵大戶連日吸納已飽，本擬再接再厲，一有機會，紛紛大施做手，晨初即承前晚餘風，狂抬至九二萬光景，此價由紙業帮王某買進，籍以表示前晚做手之證實，無如銀樓帮實貨傾出，逢高賣戶雲集，此時美鈔在錢兌莊實貨傾出下，倍形鬆動，對黃金之套價已達六一八元對十兩，金市頗多套賣，于是逐漸盤跌，惟九〇萬大關多空雙方全力爭持不下者極久，終以人爲做手過高，各方獲利出籠者源源而來，降至八九萬五以下，午收爲八九萬五，收後股債兩帮繼續前來搜買，喊價在故意在抬下，一再拉高，再回漲至九三萬三，午後現期均在九二萬五至九三萬二盤旋，大戶虎視耽耽，希圖待機一逞，格於川帮銀行高價有賣，迄銀行休業時尚難活動，結果較前收漲起六萬三，銀樓飾金九萬九，紋銀七百元，銀元四百六，暗拆因證券帮全力向金市集中，銀根頗緊，但息價仍約九分至一角二分。</p>
<p>美鈔並并不受證紙兩帮狂抬金價所影響，兌換業實貨，上塲即因獲利力售，一五〇〇元大關並未穿出，證劵帮在國曆年尾之多頭，反來陸續供給，此後金市因美鈔方面之套賣而步跌，美鈔則因金市軟化而跟跌，然趨勢尚形平庸，步降至一四五五元，午後金市仍在操縱下狂抬，美鈔亦被帶上至一五〇五元，迨三時後在一四九〇元左右徘徊，結果較前收漲六三元，港票老貨稍稍平穩，結果回好五元，新票繼續疲落，（一）字頭最低七六元，（二）字頭七四元，而後稍被拉上，結果則仍跌一元，美鈔因無空方可軋，加之投機帮存貨塞出，專攻烚赤，套價有拔開至六五〇元可能。</p>
<h3 id="c42">公債兎起鶻落多頭紛紛了結　市塲時聞賬聲　股票亦顯露疲勢 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>公債　自前日狂漲后，業中倒閉及客戶避匿者比比皆是，該業本無合法之組織，一有風潮，屢告潰散，昨市並無多大交易，多空自謀了結，丙種初開慘降至一五〇〇，業外游資仍有接踵而來，竟在抬至二千元之新高價，此喊價已達將來以關金償付價格，多頭似感滿意，紛紛了結，午刻曾降至一七〇〇以下，午收的一七五〇元，交易零星，結果較前收略漲，但較之前晚暗市，喊價則回跌不少。</p>
<p>華股　昨上場雖得金市助力，仍有拉高，但大戶存底連日出籠已罄，集中於烚赤，股市僅賴散戶點綴，頗有日暮途窮之槪，午刻遂均在低價徘徊，結果較前收計永紗跌五十元，美亞平平，信和亦然，三小熱則稍見軟化，今日起華股暗市將移至七樓集會。</p>
<p>外股初高終疲，仍受華股市況所左右，怡紗自三九〇〇元，英聯自五一〇〇元漸漸回挫，怡啤在一三五〇元。紙業一一〇〇元左右盤旋頗穩，會德豐因前日跌度過巨，昨日極爲穩定，午收結果較前收計怡紗續降一百元左右，怡啤紙業則前者平而後老跌一百元，會德豐微升，橡皮股平平，形勢恐將盤旋。</p>

<p>外幣存款滙款禁各銀行收受　〔本報訊〕二日來金融市場又起騷動，一般投機份子且謠傳新外匯率公佈時，其價格將較目前黑市爲高，故一部份商人不明眞相，紛紛向黑市購進外幣，且有少數銀行或有收受外幣存款及以外幣現鈔轉爲電匯或票匯之情形。京滬區財政金融特派員昨特鄭重通告本市銀行業公會錢業公會及各外商銀行云：「查我國外匯政策，正當政府統籌擬議中，在未公佈以前，各銀行均不得爲普通客戶開立外幣存款戶，並不得收受外幣現鈔爲常匯或票匯國外付款之業務，仰即遵照，並轉飭各行莊一體遵照，勿違爲要。」</p>

<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>在這新年的一個下午，我悠閒地走近交大校門，駐足橋畔，不禁回想到二十六年十一月國軍西撤時，就在這座橋上，發生許多雜亂慌忙的情景。那時我們許多低級員工，倉皇奔走，搶救校產，位在前上海法租界邊緣的校外宿舍，頓成了雜貨堆棧。站在海格路虹橋路轉角崗位上的廣西兵士，眼瞪瞪地望着我們一批來一批去的人羣，在鉛絲網中進出頻繁，充滿着亂慌張和不安的情緒。現在時隔九年，舊地重臨，看到擠在校門前的人羣，笑逐顏開，皆大歡喜，刦後餘生，倍增感悵！</p>
<p>踏進八年前的校門　我讀了歡迎交大校友的長幅標語，拖着一羣孩子，踏進八年來未敢正視的宮殿式門牆。和校門成垂直的長行竹籬，不知到那裘去了？第一第二柬宿舍，女生宿舍，仍頹敗地立着。我熟練地步入曾經居住七八年的兩個孩子的產生地－第二東宿舍五號寢室，門窗全毀，地板殘缺，眞是滿目凄凉。從前我倉皇出走時，未及搬運的木櫉椅桌之類和許多零星物件，仍能在回憶中想像到它們佈置的部位。南模操場上，已添築了口字形幾排新屋。校國中盛宣懷的銅像，想已變成槍彈了。古老的音樂敎室，依然無恙。十年前澆鋪柏油沒有完成的校道，仍是一片黃土，南宿舍蕩平無存。體育館竟成馬房。調養室中住滿日俘，　浪囂笑，似已忘却了戰敗的恥辱。福開森運動塲，本屬淺草平鋪，遼闊深遠，今則穢濁荒蕪，盡是敵騎殘跡。</p>
<p>麈封灰敗憔悴可憐　以前號稱皇宮的執信西齋，塵封灰敗，憔悴可憐。工程館，亦門窗不完，裂痕四現。比較完整的要算容閎堂了，不失當年舊觀。上院鐘樓上的大鐘，面部開着天窗。全幢房屋，在十年前，就有人勘測，認爲墻址傾斜，不久將有坍倒之虞，八九年來，竟能依然兀立，倒成了不可思議的奇蹟。中院外表略有改變，雖經粉刷，仍無補其衰老形態。一二三進洋房多數敎員住宅，大都剝蝕損傷，無復當年精神。網球場上，出現多幢新屋。圖書館仍枕着土山，淚枯腸空地渴望着人們給他充實食糧。我巡視全校一週，徘徊憑弔，撫今追昔，誠有隔世之感！</p>
<p>當日情景惶亂萬狀　站在圖書館的石級上，我仰視天空，回想到二十六年十一月九日那天，敵機縱橫出動，轟炸徐家匯龍華兩車站，意圖威脅國軍後撤的交通，機身低飛，掠過上院鐘樓，三五成羣，聲震魂魄，全校惶亂之情，不可言喻。那時校中笨重機器，凡可拆卸的均經裝運他遷，但測量及各種小型試騐儀器，各辦公室一切器具，均未及搬運。因校址坐落在越界築路區域，有隨時可以淪陷的危險，國人向以明哲保身著稱，全校頓陷無政府狀態，我們中下級員工乃各自爲政地，分向庶務處請派小工，以便搶運物件。小工人數本不多，此時更感不敷分配，而情勢之急迫，幾每秒鐘加重其危機。我在惶急無措中，奔向改充難民營的南模中學，拉得少壯者十餘人，由庶務處發給津貼，囑令帮同搶運，白天苦短，夜以繼之。</p>
<p>相對嗟歎一　莫展　像這樣混亂了幾天，法租界當局已與敵軍約定，凡屬交大一切校產，在內者不許出，在外者不許入，派有法日警軍，駐守校門，禁止搬運物件。學校人員已移至校外宿舍辦公，隔了一條海格路，望着校門出神。許多日用物品，未能完全搶出，相對嗟歎，一籌莫展。我因住宿校內，未及在校外租得房屋，僅於情勢危急時，携同妻兒，略取箱籠臥鋪之類，避居校外宿舍，白天進校舉炊，晚間離校外宿。未經取出之物件尚多，公義私感，交織腦際。這時住在三進洋房的李院長叔和，全家遷出後，屋中尚有零星物件，中院四樓存有紫檀椅桌全套，價頗不貲，無法搬出，屢設囑法，幾成絕望，忽遇畢業同學黃君章斌，利用他在某西人建築公司供職，設法借得英商運貨卡車一輛，以重價雇白俄充司機。</p>
<p>流離顛沛窮困無告　於某日中午時分，事先於道路試騐室工程館土木院三進洋房等處，派駐小工多人，候機搶運。我和黃君伺門警稍懈，乘車直入，急將道路試騐室全部器具，裝運出校，由霞飛路經姚主敎路轉台司脫朗路抵校外宿舍側門，隨到隨卸，隨卸隨開。復進校裝出工程館中許多木器。再進抵中院，搶出椅桌十餘件。因待裝的器具太多，車身仍嫌不够大，預計第四次可以輪到我的家具了，此時校中各單位前來接洽搬運物件者漸多，人頭攢動，奔走呼號，法警雖故作痴聾，而日軍則顯已光火，當運貨車第四次進校時，即遇阻擋，白俄司機飽受摑頰。我們乘間脫逃，此後遂無法進校，彷徨街頭，看到我遺留在第二東宿舍的衣櫉棉胎，給不知姓名者取出價賣，膛目而已。因了前法租界當局的諒解，我們的學校便得搬往震旦地下室和四樓各敎室，草草地恢復上課。從這時起，文不能拆字，武不能打拳的我們中下級員工，便度着流離顚沛，窮困無告的極度艱苦的生活。</p>
<p>天日重光鼓舞欲狂　今幸天日重光，使我得重返校門，親愛而又依戀地徘徊在每個値得紀念的塲所，眼望着轎車，三輪車，團體客車，載來大批校友，潮水似的湧進文治堂，容閎堂，簽名，茶點，開會，歡笑，我眞覺得鼓舞欲狂！或或許因爲八九年來，環境磨折得我太蒼老了，他們不再認識我了，我也懶得和他們招呼。無意中倒遇見好幾批復校情殷的員工，他們很親切地問我有什麼消息，我說，我們不都是找得職業了嗎？這也就足够自傲的了。因爲無法安慰他們的熱情，我急忙拖着一羣孩子，在悵惘留戀的情緒中，步出校門，身後陡的起了一陣旋風，傳來文治堂上熱情而又劇烈的掌聲。</p>

<p>根據財產估計凈值　茲經彙集各次研究意見，兼顧事實法理，歸納爲五項；（一）資本原爲法幣，其後改成僞幣，但並未增減資本者，應將其資本恢復爲法幣原額，（二）資本原爲法幣，其後改成僞幣，且經增加僞幣資本者，應根據其現有財產，以法幣估計其凈値，此項凈値如足値帳面偽幣資本原額者，得照僞幣原額改爲法幣，如不足額，應由出資人補繳法幣足類，或減少其資本額，（三）資本自始即爲僞幣者，照上述第二項辦理，（四）二十六年八一三後增資之公司，舊股東未能參加認購新股者，得於規定限期內，照原有資本與現在決定之資本額，比例補繳新股股款，不願補繳或少繳者聽，（例如某公司原有資本五十萬元，後增至五百萬元，現估値決定資本爲五百萬元，某股東原有舊股五萬元，因交通阻絕，未能於增資時認購新股，現在得規定限期補繳新股四十五萬元，該公司資本額擴充爲五百四十五萬），</p>
<p>公司主體舊股東會　（五）惟在新舊股東尚未依（二四）兩項之規定辦理增資改組完成登記手續以前，仍以舊股東會爲公司之主體，新舊股東發生權限爭執時，依公司法及其他有關法令處理之，新股東如不願參加改組之公司者亦聽，其退出之股份，由舊股東承受或代爲轉讓，或減少公司之資本總額，以上各節，理合據情專電呈請，仰祈鑒核迅賜採納施行，實爲公便，上海市商會叩删。（十五日）</p>

<h3 id="c97">小荷 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>在那幾十個女孩子中，我最忘不了她！</p>
<p>笑盈盈的臉，孩子樣的尚未長成的身材，圓而大，有着黑玉般光彩的眸子，玲瓏的會說話的嘴，那是蘇小荷。——一個初中三的學生，當我敎她們班上國文的時候，蘇小荷坐在第一排，這十四歲半的女孩子有着過人的禀賦，和驚人的頑皮。課堂上，如果她靜心聽你講書，她會睜大了那雙黑玉似的眼睛，聚精會神的，好像全世界什麼也分不了她的心；她的悟性和記性比任何同學都强，別人不懂的她早懂了，別人不記得的她却很容易的記得極淸楚；如果碰她不愛聽講的時候，她扮着鬼臉逗先生笑，黑眼珠子溜來溜去的，像一頭不安份的小貓。</p>
<p>我出奇的歡喜她，雖然也沒奈何她那出奇的淘氣與頑皮。平良心說，在四十多個初三學生中，她即使不是成績最優，至少是天賦最佳；即使不是最美，至少是最可愛的一個。我自信批評得一點也不過份。</p>
<p>有一次，課餘的辰光，我被她們拉了坐在滿诂太陽的廻廊裏聊天。蘇小荷問我：</p>
<p>『先生，李白爲什麼又呌李太白呢？』</p>
<p>別的人全都笑了。一</p>
<p>我也笑着反問她：』你爲什麼呌蘇小荷呢？』</p>
<p>大而圓的黑眼睛閃了閃，笑開了臉，嘻着小嘴說：』爹爹題的名字，我不知道。』</p>
<p>『你太不像你的名字了，荷花是最幽靜不過的，你像一朶野薔薇，又似一雙小野貓。』</p>
<p>『小野貓不大好聽，先生要歡喜我呌薔薇，我就改名呌薔薇吧！』她乖巧的說。</p>
<p>『那太費事了，』我不禁大笑：『改名字要大動干戈，還得呈報敎育局哩！』</p>
<p>『其實，先生，荷花才最是値得驕傲與光榮，』她忽然一本正經起來，小大人似的：『因爲在頂頂汚穢的泥沼裹開出最美麗最純潔的花朶。』</p>
<p>我點點頭。她的話是對的，然而這那像一個十四歲半孩子的說話？於是我爲這早慧的學生而祖心，一點莫明其所以然的杞憂，過後慢慢的也就遺忘了。</p>
<p>在那個學校裹我僅僅担任了半年的工作，後來就離開了。這半年的生活，却予我以無限深刻的回憶，而沒有一次回憶裹我不想到那孩子的，那笑盈盈的臉，有着黑玉樣眸子，會說話的蘇小荷！</p>
<p>那樣可愛的孩子應該是幸福的。</p>
<p>誰知道兩個月前的一個午後，她到我住的地方來看我，告訴我她不再讀書了，失學已經半年，因爲她的父親供給不起太多子女的學費，所以小荷初中讀完，沒有再入高中。</p>
<p>『不過，萬一東西不再是那麼樣樣往上漲，或是爹爹有點較好的收入的話，下學期我還是可以讀書的。』小荷解釋着，帶點自慰的口吻；她一點也不沮喪，還是笑盈盈的臉、還是黑玉樣光亮的一雙眸子，身材可比以前長高了。</p>
<p>臨走她丟下一小包用紅錄透明紙包着的糖菓，靦腆的笑着：『這個送給你，昨天姑姑給我和弟弟的，我分了一半；現在再分一半給你。』</p>
<p>話沒說完，她就跑了。</p>
<p>我覺得惆悵，惆悵，無比的惆悵。黃昏去了，黑暗侵襲了屋子，我扭亮了燈，一個人坐着，沉思，又沉思，吃着這孩子留下的糖，不知道是甜？還是苦？…</p>
<p>兩個月的光陰那樣快的過去了，又到了學期大考的時候，接踵而來的當是繳留額金，放寒假，付學費，買書，然後又一個新的學期開始。</p>
<p>我想起了小荷，她爲什麼沒有再來過？我又想起了她這學期的讀書問題，兩個月後的物價並沒有比兩個月以前低，現在，我只有希望她的父親能有一個較好的收入了。</p>
<p>然而，小荷一直沉沉沒有消息，我又沒有她的地址。</p>
<p>一直到昨天，我接着另一個學生的信，她告訴我這樣一個消息：「先生，我想每一個愛小荷的人知道了全都會琉眼淚的，允其是你，因爲你是那樣像姊妹般的寳愛她，多麼可憐呀！我們的小野貓，小薪薇，爲了生活的壓迫，爲了環境的驅使，她到飯店裹去常女招待去了，前天晚上我去找她，她出去了，小荷的媽媽含着眼淚將這一切告訴我，並且叮囑着不要說給別人聽，難爲情，人家要笑她的……先生，我知道你不會笑她，所以我告訴你………」</p>
<p>我沒有眼淚，並非是不愛小荷，實在，我心裹的情緒比流眼淚還要無法形容的難受。我將那封信讀了一遍，又一遍，我希望這些事情全是假的，不幸寫這封信的學生是個最誠實的孩子。</p>
<p>怪不得小荷些日子沒有再來過，她怕難爲情，她怕她的先生笑她當了女招待。啊！傻孩子，你雖然聽明，倒底還年輕，你的先生就這樣的不懂事麼？</p>
<p>我希望能再看見她，即使只有一次也好，我希望再看見時，還是那笑盈盈的臉，還是那黑玉般光亮的眸子、還是那樣無邪和天眞。</p>
<p>然而，這是可能的麼？</p>
<p>沒有人能回答這一個簡單的問題，也許只有天知道，我抬起頭，望着窗外的天，天是從未有過的如此之藍，沒有雲，只有一片無比輝煌的好太陽；我這才知道自己是坐在太陽的光輝裏，於是我想起一切太陽光輝裹的往事，那僅有的半年敎育生活，和一大羣女孩子坐在滿是太陽的廻廊裹那天……</p>
<p>『先生，荷花才最値得驕傲與光榮，因爲在頂頂汚穢的泥沼裹開出最美麗最純潔的花朶。』我想起了小荷的話。可敬佩的好孩子！你勝似你的毫無閱歷的老師不止一百倍，能說出這樣的話，必然也懂得話中的理，你當不會忘了怎樣去生存在泥沼中，又怎樣開出最美麗最純潔的花朶！我相信你不會事負了你的旣驕傲而又光榮的名字！</p>
<h3 id="c98">詩歌朗誦的技巧和資料 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 朱絳</p>
<p>這幾年來，詩歌是在向着朗誦的大路走去。我們知道：在武漢，在重慶，在上海…都曾舉行過詩歌朗誦會。最近。上海文藝界第一屆文藝晚會內，也有詩歌朗誦的節目。可是，從大體上說來，朗誦的成績並不算好。這並不算好的原因可以分成兩方面：</p>
<p>一，朗誦的技巧問題；二，朗誦的資料間題。</p>
<p>許多詩人是只會用筆寫，而不善吟哦的，一旦要他登台朗誦，成績當然難能可觀；許多詩人都不會講國語，一旦朗誦起來，南腔北調，紛然雜陳，這是很容易引起嗤笑的。記得某詩人朗誦一首關於高爾基的詩，情調非常優閒，然而，因爲是江北國語，結果聽衆都嗤笑於他的江北音而不注意他所朗誦的內容了。</p>
<p>詩人是最容易超離現實的。超離現實的詩人，生活經騐不够，對於詩意所包含喜怒哀樂複雜的情緒，往往無從體騐，不能把握，這是朗誦不好的又一原因。詩人如果對於話劇，音樂是門外漢，那麼，朗誦起來，要求其能優美動聽，也是很困難的。</p>
<p>以上是關於朗誦的技巧問題。要解次這問題，詩人們必須努力練習口才，學習國語，多多參加並體騐實生活，多多接受話劇的技巧，加深音樂的修養。</p>
<p>巧婦固然不能作無米之炊，巧婦也不能把爛米煮成香噴噴的飯。詩人們縱然具備了很優秀的朗誦技巧，但如果沒有適當的朗誦資料，那也是徒然的。</p>
<p>詩人們往往迷意於字句的華美，形式的特異，而不肯自己用口讀，用耳聽，更不層大衆來讀讀聰聽，這樣的詩，要其朗誦起來聽衆爲之動容，是不可能想像的。詩人們又往往是夭之驕子，超脫得彷彿不食人問煙火食似地，滿腦裝滿了花呀，月呀，美人呀，葡萄酒呀…他們將霎那問輕煙似掠過的靈感捕捉下來，寫成妙品。這樣的作品妙則妙矣，可是，要它使跟實生活摩出光的聽衆瞭解，那却是太難了！詩人們甚且都是天才，不需學習，不必修改，只消將靈感順着筆尖馳騁在紙上，旣不必講音節，也不必談韵脚，甚至把散文拆開來排列在紙上也行！這樣的作品要求其能如誦和聽得懂，也就可想其難了。</p>
<p>詩歌朗誦的資料要求其能得到良好的效果，必須做到：</p>
<p>一，所朗誦的詩，必須能代表聽衆的心聲，這樣，就容易被接受，引起共鳴。</p>
<p>二，所朗誦的詩的內容必須與聽衆生活有密切的聯緊。輕煙似的靈感，他們是不會感到興味的</p>
<p>三，詩的用語必須儘可能和聽衆的口語接近。深奧高貴的東西，羣衆是無法消受的！</p>
<p>四，詩的結構不太奇特，造句不太長，不歐化，用字不偏僻。</p>
<p>五，雖然不必講平仄，要對仗，但至少讀起來音節要順適，韵脚要響亮。</p>
<p>以上算是詩歌朗育屬於資料方面最低的五個要求。</p>
<p>詩歌朗誦是藝術表演的一種。詩歌朗誦是比其他藝術表演如戲劇，電影，歌唱，舞蹈等來得單調和不容易討好。所以，詩歌朗誦，要求其收效好，必須在技巧和資料兩方面，多多修養和準備才好！</p>

<p>— 慕容隨</p>
<p>「將上堂，聲必揚」一聲「合罕給人家先來一個準備，禮也。咳嗽合於禮，此咳嗽之所以不可不會也，咳也而近於道矣！「不顧而唾」，此義憤塡膺者之正養感也。唾痰而合於養，此唾痰之所以不可不會也，痰也而近於道矣！</p>
<p>「道可道，非常道」，神而明之，存乎其人！</p>
<p>先生立在講台上敎課；學生在講堂（上打磕睡！「吾道窮矣乎」？未也。一聲「合罕」，學生悚然而覓，於是聽講如初，於是「夫子循循然善誘人」！</p>
<p>「堯讓天下於許由，許由不受」却很費勁地跑到河邊去洗他的耳朶，豈不笨哉！如果許由一聲「畢吐」，濃痰「及第」。豈不「毅然決然」！「有聲有色」哉！吾人讀史至此，欲不爲之「擊碎唾壺」，不可得也。</p>
<p>居今之世，無變於古之道，神而明之，更存乎其人矣。</p>
<p>譬如在什麼辯論塲所：你總得說上幾句，在昂然起立以後：「兄弟兄弟…今天今天…。如果還想不出要說什么話時，那就得「合罕」「合罕」再「合罕」……人家也就會同情你了「今日身子不爽吧」？又如果人家說的不合你的轍時。也可又「合罕」「合罕」，一直「合罕」下去，其效力至少可又使人家精神分散。</p>
<p>至於「畢吐」，那更有意想不到之效力，可以使人家望而却走，說你同他反對吧，那么事出無心，說你對他同情吧，你却早已「不顧而唾」了。如果你有了肺癆病。那還可以輕描淡寫也散佈癆菌置對方於死地，比之散佈流言還有效力，豈不妙哉！</p>
<p>妙哉妙哉！妙到毫巔妙手偶得之耳，此之謂「咳唾璣珠」！</p>

<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>在墨老爺沒回來以前，寶鈴確是管翁二太太呌爸爸，那時他又爲也許這就是翁二太太的名字，因爲他還不大懂得爸爸兩個字的意義。后來墨老爺回來了，他很久不知應當管他呌什麼？還是墨盛有一次告訴了他，并且把爸爸的意義解釋給他聽，他才恍然大悟，於是從此他不管翁二太太呌爸爸了。爲了這，他的小腦袋壳上挨過墨太太好幾巴掌。心眼兒裏自然不服，嘴頭上可不敢『哼吱』一聲兒。根據他這一年來的經騐，媽媽却是比爸爸兇得多。媽媽爲什麼比爸爸兇，爸爸爲什麼偏那樣怕媽媽，如今他也漸漸明白了，這都是墨盛空的時候，告訴他的。但，他覺得媽媽固然有理，可也不必過分地打擊一個「落湯鷄」。因此他仍然是很同情爸爸。</p>
<p>這會子，寳鈴念着書念着書，忽然發現墨老爺坐在一邊直發呆，於是禁不住站起來，走到墨老爺的面前。說：</p>
<p>「爸爸，我念熟啦！」</p>
<p>『啊？……噢，好好！好孩子！」</p>
<p>墨老爺給寳鈴說得一楞，繼而總沉思中清醒了，他又像是墮入了昨夜的夢境，而且意味着那串往事，竟和昨夜的夢中情景有些類似，他覺得有些奇怪，但，爲了他要關照寳鈴的功課，一時沒有情緒去細細理解。便强裝鎭靜地轉過臉去向着寳鈴證：</p>
<p>『那麼，你就背給我聽聽。一』</p>
<p>寳鈴順從地轉過身去，用清脆的聲音背誦着：</p>
<p>「「人之初，性本善；性相近，習相遠！」」</p>
<p>寳鈴剛剛背了個頭兒，忽然墨盛慌慌張張地走進來。</p>
<p>「老爺！老爺！太太要分娩了！太太要分娩了！』墨盛又驚又喜地嚷着。</p>
<p>墨老爺又被震動了一下，他猝然站起來。</p>
<p>『快去請翁二太太來，還有，告訴翁二太太帶個收生婆子。」</p>
<p>「翁二太太早來了，收生婆子剛剛到，道會子正忙得緊呢！』墨盛說罷就又忽忽地去了。</p>
<p>墨老爺這才放下心。他在屋裹踱了幾步，興奮地向寳鈴說：</p>
<p>「寳鈴，你快有弟弟了！噢，你還是喜歡妹妹呢？』</p>
<p>墨老爺提出這個問題以後，連他自己也覺得茫然了，他想：「我倒是希望再有個兒子呢？還是要個女兒？」</p>
<p>『我喜歡妹妹，我不喜歡弟弟。』寳鈴稍加思索了一會兒，回答墨老爺說。</p>
<p>『對！最好給你再添一個妹妹！」墨老爺說着，拍了拍寳鈴的頭。</p>
<p>墨老爺這時心裏很高興，他一不記得當初寳鈴誕生的時候，他是什麼心情。</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>一萬學子……亟待救濟</p>
<p>三千難已……嗷嗷待浦</p>
<p>上海目前有兩項義舉，迫切呼籲，請求各界熱心人士，出錢出力，多多愈善！我昨天說過，上海市敎育貸金委員會，將搶救一萬名淸寒學子的失學，需要一萬萬元來完成搶救的義舉。各校寒假已近，即將開始辦理申請登記的手續，轉瞬之間，春季開學，試問牘者諸君，能忍令這些可愛的靑年一朝失學麼？靑年失學，不是一人一家的損失，而是國家社會的大損失。假令豐衣足食的人，大家凑上一點錢，來負起敎濟的責任，這樁極有意義的助學工作，不難水到成渠，功德無量。</p>
<p>冬令救濟，此其時矣！本報代收捐款，而捐款未見踴躍，殊深遺憾！古人「雪中送炭」，千古傳爲佳話，甚望熱心人士，見義勇爲，踴躍輸將，使這項救濟事業，不致中道而廢。該會現設收容所七處，共收流民及難童三千人，施以衣食教養，給他們安寧生活；街頭乞丐，小偸，　手，流氓，原爲上海最不堪的惡作劇，如今當局全部收容，誠是十里洋塲値得稱頌的德政，說句良心話，市民們理應多多捐輸，充實基金，使這班洗民幼有所敎，老有所養，確是上海社會共同的神聖義務！</p>

<p>編輯先生：讀貴報特派員張軍先生所紀義民還鄉的一節，非常感動。敬將我私人的經過，報告於諸位先生：我是民國二十八年七月由中央機器廠在上海招來的，沿途有領導人，經過香港海防，到處有人招待。家眷是二九年又由廠方送來的。這是　方的好意，到昆明六年，又　　方提升爲工人的領班，所以我對廠方非常感謝的。但是我遼遠的家鄉，還有七十左右的高年父母，他們在這「被敵人爲淸鄉而將房屋焚燒殆盡的」斷垣殘壁中，度過八年奴隸生活，我在這生活困難的環境，產生了兩個孩子，加上我的罪架。最高興的抗戰勝利，可以同拋棄了八年的家鄉和分散的父母兄弟團圓這是我唯一的希望。也是我義民們唯一的希望。誰知內戰的砲火會繼勝利的歡聲而來，各地交通阻梗，現在內戰雖停，而全國工業一落千丈，各工廠的遣散和饑寒失業的悲聲，廣展到各地，但是救濟和遣送義民還鄉的佳音，有各機關的無綫電，和各報傳遍了大地，社會人氏對此厭聞厭視，祇有這班失業的義民，欲歸無路，求救無門，希望上帝用救世的力量，將「救濟和遣送」的機會，降到每個失業義民的頭上來。那知上帝和財神有意作崇，他們要做運送美鈔黃金和商品投機事業，貧苦的失業義民，要求乘這機會還鄉，這是不可能的。現在各同鄉會和工協會聯合組織義民還鄉協會，我以爲這是最可靠的機會，我即向同鄉會登記，據說以後有免費的希望，或者照一萬餘元的願價，我立刻辦理離廠手續，並得到廠方的遣散費和五萬元的交通補助費，我等了十多天的義民還鄉車，沒有一個確實訊息，據說昆明有十萬以上的義民，這一期登記義民有三千餘人，遣送的車輛祗有十輛汽車，最多每天祗能遣送三百人，照這樣十萬以上義民，何年何月方能回到老家。我今天含着淚借貴報一角，向諸位申訴，我們義民到底何月何日才可以乘着車船回鄉？眞急死人哩！昆民中央機器廠退職人薛後興一月十一日寄</p>

<h3 id="e1">Government Representatives Offer Opinions on the Convening of the National Assembly <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 17th] The Political Consultative Conference held its seventh meeting at 3:00 PM on the 17th to discuss the issue of the National Assembly. Government representatives, including Sun Ke and eight others, presented their opinions on the National Assembly, which were explained by Zhang Lisheng. Zhang Bojun, Deng Yingchao, Zhang Dongsun, Wu Yuzhang, Zhang Junmai, Zeng Qi, Wang Yunwu, Qian Xinzhi, Shao Congen, Hu Lin, Guo Moruo, Fu Sinian, Shao Lizi, and others spoke successively, and all were submitted to a subcommittee for summarization and negotiation.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Associated Press, 17th] At today's meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, government and Communist Party representatives could not agree on various proposals for convening the National Assembly on May 5th to end political tutelage and implement constitutional government. Later, the Communist Party formally put forward ten points on the process of national construction. Zhang Lisheng, representing the government, said that he hoped to convene the National Assembly to end one-party rule and return power to the people without further delay. He also requested that the second National Assembly be convened within six months to pass the constitution, and that representatives to the assembly should be elected according to the constitution.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, This Newspaper, 16th] Zhang Shenfu said at the conference that the Party had harmed China greatly. Shao Lizi rose and spoke in a gentle tone, first pointing out that the people are currently living in hardship and the nation is facing difficulties. While the Party knows that its efforts have been insufficient, without the organization of the Tongmenghui by the Party, the Manchu Qing Dynasty could not have been overthrown; without the reorganization of the Party and the Northern Expedition, the Northern Warlords could not have been eliminated, and the country could not have been unified. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, without the leadership of the Party, victory could not have been achieved, and the state today would be unimaginable. How can one make a distorted interpretation that turns black and white upside down, completely negating the achievements of the Party? He asked everyone to speak fairly.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 17th] The eighth meeting of the Political Consultative Conference is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 18th, with the agenda being the draft constitution. In addition, the policy program group of the Political Consultative Conference will meet at the Supreme National Defense Council at 9:00 AM on the 17th, and the government organization group will meet at the Senate at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Three-Person Group to Discuss Reorganizing Communist Party Troops</p>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 17th] Regarding the Military Affairs Three-Person Group meeting, after Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek appointed Minister Zhang Zhizhong and Chairman Zhang Qun as representatives of the Military Affairs Commission on the government side, they began talks with Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai at Minister Zhang's residence at 4:00 PM on the 15th, holding preliminary and broad discussions on the reorganization of the Communist Party troops. However, due to Minister Zhang feeling slightly unwell, he will rest for a day or two on doctor's orders before continuing specific discussions.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, This Newspaper, 16th] Regarding the number of troops in the future, the Youth Party advocates reducing the number to 120 divisions this year and 60 divisions next year. The Democratic League advocates reducing the number to the greatest extent possible. Lin Wei reported on the government's plan to reduce the number to 90 divisions this year. Zeng Qi expressed his gratification, but Zhou Enlai believed that it would not be easy to reduce such a large number of troops, and that the CCP should retain at least 26 divisions in accordance with the Double Tenth Agreement. He also said that the army can only be mobilized after the national reorganization is completed and the constitutional government is fully realized.</p>
<p>[Chongqing, This Newspaper, 16th] At the sixth meeting, the Youth Party and the Democratic League's proposals on the nationalization of the army were discussed. After Chen Qitian and Liang Shuming described the original proposals separately, the chairman asked Lin Wei of the Ministry of Military Administration to report on the National Army's reorganization plan and implementation process. One-third of the National Army was reorganized last year, and the reorganization will continue. Zhang Qun reported that the three-person group had begun work, discussing the Communist army plan, striving to realize the nationalization of the army, and explaining that the Kuomintang would withdraw from the army. Zhou Enlai also agreed with the separation of party and army, making the original proposal lose its meaning, so the discussion was limited to minor issues. Zeng Qi expressed his gratification, saying that if the military issue is resolved, the political issue can also be resolved. If the political issue is resolved, then politics will be on the right track, the future of this conference is very optimistic, and the future of the country is infinitely bright.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Zhang Lisheng Explains Orally: The Assembly Will Be Held on May 5th as Scheduled, to Enact the Constitution and Determine the Date of Its Implementation, with a Reasonable Increase in the Number of Representatives Beyond Those Already Elected <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 17th] At the seventh meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, Member Zhang Lisheng explained the government representatives' "Opinions on the National Assembly" as follows: Chairman, esteemed members. Today's agenda is to discuss the National Assembly issue. The government representatives have put forward four opinions, the wording of which is quite simple, so I would like to make an oral report on some of the meanings for the reference of the conference in its deliberations.</p>
<p>(1) To convene the National Assembly on May 5, 1946. Our founding father advocated building the country with the Three Principles of the People, and the stage of "political tutelage" is the most important in the process of national construction. However, the "political tutelage" period is based on the law of the Chinese Kuomintang, which is entrusted by the people to exercise political power. In the past few years, the government and the ruling Kuomintang have wanted to complete the work that should be done during the period of political tutelage, namely local self-government, as soon as possible, and then return power to the people. Unfortunately, during the process of political tutelage, the country suffered many misfortunes and setbacks. In the past eight or nine years, it has encountered an unprecedented national crisis, which has led to the postponement of the National Assembly, which was decided to be convened in 1937. At this time, the War of Resistance began. In order to strive for national survival and victory in the War of Resistance, the convening of the National Assembly had to be delayed. Fortunately, although many dangers were experienced in the eight years, final victory was achieved, which should be attributed to the consistent sacrifice and hard work of the people throughout the country and the armed soldiers at the front lines. Tracing the fundamental element of victory, it still relies on the leadership of a great leader who is arduous, indomitable, and tenacious. Today, the War of Resistance has been won, and the National Government has been established for nearly 20 years. The people of the whole country have a universal understanding and deep belief in the Three Principles of the People created by our founding father, and the country has achieved independence, freedom, and equality. However, having independence, freedom, and equality requires the people of the whole country to strive for self-improvement and have the strength to guarantee independence, freedom, and equality in order to stand tall in the world. In view of this, the government wants to return power to the people as soon as possible and place the responsibility of building the country in the future on the shoulders of all the people. Therefore, the National Assembly must be convened on May 5th of this year.</p>
<p>(2) The powers of the first National Assembly are to enact the constitution. The powers of this National Assembly are to enact the constitution and decide the date of implementation of the constitution, as we have explained. The National Assembly in the Five-Power Constitution is the highest political organ of the state. The representatives of the National Assembly have the power to elect, recall, initiate, and referendum on central politics. The powers of this National Assembly are only to enact the constitution, that is to say, this National Assembly does not exercise the powers stipulated in the constitution. In other words, it cannot elect government officials and exercise the three powers of administrative recall, initiation, and referendum. We feel that this should be the case from the stage of political tutelage to the beginning of constitutional government.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to those already elected, the remaining number of representatives to the first National Assembly can be reasonably increased. The reason for reasonably increasing the number of representatives other than those already elected is that after more than eight years of the War of Resistance, people from all walks of life throughout the country have a deep understanding of political experience and the way to build the country in the future, and have an urgent demand. Therefore, this National Assembly should gather ideas from all sources, accommodate more capable, insightful, and enthusiastic people for the country, and contribute more of their abilities to this National Assembly.</p>
<p>(4) The second National Assembly shall be elected and convened within six months of the promulgation of the constitution, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. The so-called second National Assembly refers to the National Assembly stipulated in the constitution that will be convened on May 5th of this year to enact and announce the constitution. It is hoped that it will be elected and convened within six months in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. This point needs to be specially explained. We know that there is a view in society that there are many opinions on the validity of the representatives of the first National Assembly. Some views hold that the representatives of the first National Assembly who have already been elected should be re-elected. Our government and the ruling party also attach great importance to this view and have considered it. However, after our consideration, there is no reason not to recognize the qualifications of the representatives who have already been elected in accordance with the law in the past. There are two reasons: one is based on legal principles, and the other is based on reason and the current political situation. First, from the first point, we cannot find a basis in law. We look at the National Assembly Organization Law amended and promulgated on May 21, 1937, which has two articles. The first article is that the National Assembly formulates the constitution and decides the date of implementation of the constitution. Article 11 is that the National Assembly ends its term when its task is completed. According to these two provisions, the powers of the National Assembly are to formulate the constitution and decide the date of implementation of the constitution. The representatives of the National Assembly only have this task and no term of office. The government has no legal basis to remove them from this task. Secondly, from the second point, looking at the general trend in politics today, what the country hopes for is unity and unification, and to seek national stability from unity and unification. All of you here are also here to hold a consultative conference in order to seek unity and unification and national stability. Suppose the government or any party does not recognize the qualifications of the nine hundred and something representatives who have already been elected in accordance with the law in the past, and re-elects them. May I ask what those hundreds of representatives will think and how they will react? It should be noted that these representatives are elected from various localities and occupational groups, and we cannot say that they do not represent the will of the majority of the people. If we must reluctantly refuse to recognize them, then today we believe that the various parties have not been able to fully agree on political views in the past, and we still have to painstakingly convene a political consultative conference by the government. Then, if the qualifications of these nine hundred and something representatives are denied or cancelled, will they also form another group like other parties, express their opinions and wishes to the government, and then hold another, or even several, consultative conferences? How will the government handle this? Therefore, the government has no legal basis, and cannot but consider the reason and the current political situation. It cannot but recognize the representatives who have already been elected in the past, and because there is such a view in society, it has adopted a compromise approach in the fourth item, stipulating that within six months after the completion of the task of the first National Assembly, the second National Assembly will be convened in accordance with the constitution to be formulated in the future. The representatives of this second National Assembly will of course be elected by universal suffrage without objection, and their powers will be to exercise the right to elect, recall, initiate, and referendum on the central government. The above is a simple explanation of the four opinions we have put forward on the National Assembly. As for how to reasonably increase the number of representatives to the National Assembly, how to increase the number, and how much increase is reasonable, the government has no preconceptions and would like to submit this to the conference for the opinions of all of you, and then conduct further consultations. In addition, we hope that you will contribute your opinions as much as possible on any problems that we have not thought of, in order to facilitate consultation.</p>

<p>[Shanghai, This Newspaper, Associated Press] 5,000 soldiers of the New Sixth Army are scheduled to leave Shanghai on six US landing craft today for the Northeast. The first landing craft left the port at 10:15 AM. The 26,000 officers and soldiers of the army are expected to leave before the 22nd of this month.

<p>[Tianjin, Central News Agency, 16th] The Northeast Security Command established a checkpoint in Yuguan on the 16th, and civilians and soldiers leaving the customs are not allowed to carry more than 5,000 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>[Changchun, Central News Agency, 16th] The world-renowned Mainland Academy of Sciences has been taken over by Wang Zheng and Fang Yi, directors of the Changchun Railway Administration, in order to avoid losses. The academy is very large in scale, with 23 research laboratories, including agricultural chemistry, forest product chemistry, animal product chemistry, biochemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, electrochemistry, physics, civil engineering, first civil engineering, second fermentation soil property, fiber, fuel, combustion metallurgy, machinery, electrical, architecture, and air defense. There are also laboratories for physicochemical teaching materials, high temperature, low temperature, and four test laboratories. There are also four factories for machinery, grease, plywood, and glass, as well as an animal husbandry experiment farm, a horse epidemic research institute, a plague research institute (in Shenyang), a geological survey institute, and the Harbin branch.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Shen Yi Flies from Beiping to Changchun to Receive 200 Staff in Dalian <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Beiping, This Newspaper, 16th] Shen Yi, the mayor of Dalian, returned to Beiping by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane at 4:00 PM today. Because there are matters to be dealt with here, he will stay for one day on the 17th, and will change to flying to Changchun with the receiving staff on the 18th to go to his post. Shen is quite optimistic about the situation in the Northeast, but believes that the reception of Dalian is a difficult task, because Dalian has been under foreign rule for half a century, and there are problems with talent, systems, etc. The 200 receiving staff in Dalian this time are more numerous than those in other provinces and cities, but in fact they are still not enough. Taking education as an example, if one person is sent to each unit, more than 100 people are needed, and the difficulties in the system are no less than those in talent. For example, for decades, everything in the city has been based on Japanese, and the suffering of the accumulated difficulties after the takeover is similar to that of Taiwan.</p>
<p>[Beiping, This Newspaper, 16th] The Chinese and Soviets have reached an agreement on the issue of receiving Dalian. Zhang Jiaxuan telegraphed from Changchun, urging Shen Yi to go quickly. Shen can return to Beiping from Qingdao today and is scheduled to fly to Changchun on the 17th. In addition, Sun Yueqi was appointed as a special commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Northeast and flew to Changchun by special plane this morning with more than a dozen industrial and mining experts. Sun himself will return to Beiping in three to five days to deal with unfinished business in Beiping. His position as director of the Bureau for the Disposition of Enemy and Puppet Industries in Beiping and Tianjin will be temporarily taken over by Gu Yiqiao.</p>
<p>[Changchun, Central News Agency, 16th] Another batch of airlifted troops arrived this afternoon, and 56 receiving personnel from various departments, including Sun Yueqi, Li Menghua, Gu Jian, and Wang Zuomin, also arrived in Changchun.</p>
<p>[Harbin, Central News Agency, 17th] The Songjiang Provincial Government recently held its first provincial committee meeting since its establishment. The main agenda was: (1) to organize auxiliary committees for receiving provinces and subordinate counties, (2) to formulate measures to reduce the burden on the people, and (3) to formulate a rural relief plan.</p>
<p>[Siping, Central News Agency, 16th] The receiving work in various counties of Liaobei Province has begun. At 9:00 AM today, Zhao Nudong, the county magistrate of Changtu County, accompanied by police personnel and Soviet liaison officers, went to receive the county. Other county magistrates of Xi'an, Lishu, Kaiyuan, and Liaoyuan are also preparing to set off.</p>

<p>[Chongqing, This Newspaper, 16th] (1) Chen Qitian explained the proposal, emphasizing the method of nationalizing the army and implementing democracy. (2) When Liang Shuming stood up to speak, there was a slight hiss from the audience. (3) When Zhang Qun reported, he did not leave his seat. Fu Sinian protested that he never came, Zhang Qun said because it was not long, he wanted to be lazy, so he stood in the middle and repeated it again. (4) Deputy Minister Lin reported on the progress and plan of army reorganization, and temporarily added a large drawing board frame with a statistical table. All the numbers for nine years were complete. The government made the most confidential things during the war public after the war. (5) Zhou Enlai frankly admitted that there are the deepest prejudices and the strictest boundaries regarding the issue of guns, and it is the most difficult to handle. For the sake of the country and the expectations of the people, he will definitely handle it well. (6) Zhang Dongsun and Liang Shuming urged the government to quickly realize Chairman Chiang's promise, while Li Zili and Chen Bulei said that it is not easy to be thorough and thorough if they are urged too quickly. Today, Zeng Qi hopes that the three-person group should quickly conduct consultations so that the reorganization plan of the CCP army can be completed in advance during the meeting period. Lu Dingyi said that fast is good, but it is difficult to be reasonable and thorough. (7) When Lu Dingyi, the Minister of Propaganda of the CCP, spoke, he spoke in a local accent, repeatedly and repeatedly, quite like a village teacher. (8) As Lu Dingyi spoke of being forced to join Liangshan, Zhou Enlai frequently looked at him. (9) It was already one o'clock, Lu Dingyi was talking endlessly, the chairman rang the bell for the first time, saying that the time was up, but still waited for Lu Dingyi to finish before announcing the adjournment.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Ceasefire Deadline Extended Again, Communist Forces Still Disrupting Everywhere, Mediation Department Sends Planes to Distribute Truce Leaflets <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] The Headquarters of the Chinese Army has established close contact with the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Department and has adopted an attitude of extreme trust, providing accurate intelligence on the continued attacks by Communist forces in various regions, including northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, northeastern Anhui, and southwestern Henan, on National Army troops after the ceasefire deadline, the destruction of transportation, and the forceful attacks on the Zaozhuang and Jiawang mining areas. Today, Communist forces in Gaoyou, Taixian, and other areas of northern Jiangsu are still stirring.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] U.S. Representative Robinson of the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Department and Military Affairs Commission Representative Zheng Jiemin, to adapt to current factual needs, will make their greatest efforts to urge the Communist forces in Lincheng and other areas of the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to quickly comply with the ceasefire order, so as to restore traffic on the entire Tianjin-Pukou line as soon as possible. Communist representative Ye Jianying has expressed his agreement. Yesterday, a U.S. Marine Corps aircraft dropped orders to cease conflict in the areas of Communist forces activity in southern Shandong. It is heard that within three days at the latest, the Military Mediation Department is expected to send an executive group to Xuzhou to work.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] Military News: It is heard that two major difficulties have been discovered in the execution of the military mediation work in Hebei Province: (1) Some members of the Communist forces do not obey the orders of the Communist Party. The majority of these elements are former Japanese soldiers and bandits. The inevitable result for these people is, besides fleeing to the mountains to become outlaws, knowing that there is no other way out, they have begun to mutiny. The Communist Party's policy of relying on bandits for self-importance is akin to using straw to put out a fire, harming the country and afflicting the common people. (2) The number of personnel in the executive group is insufficient for the current factual needs. At least seven or eight more small groups must be dispatched to carry out the work in order to quickly expand operations. The Military Affairs Commission has recently dispatched many more cadres to Peiping, and Yan'an is in the process of selecting more.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 17th] Central Committee member Zheng Jiemin of the Military Mediation Executive Department, Communist representative Ye Jianying, and U.S. representative Robinson have held two meetings. Today, more planes were dispatched to carry leaflets of Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order to Chifeng, Zhangde, and Jinan, distributing them to both National and Communist armies in order to establish peace.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Although U.S. Navy planes have distributed leaflets spreading the central government's ceasefire order, instances of disobedience continue to occur in various regions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 17th] Government representative Zhang Qun reiterated his previous statement, saying that he would do his utmost to bring the war to a final conclusion. Yesterday, Zhang revealed that the fundamental work of the Military Subcommittee will be completed within one month, and it is expected that the Communist armies will be reorganized two months later. Zhang Qun and Zhou Enlai are both members of the subcommittee.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th] Communist forces in Shanxi Province still did not implement the ceasefire order on the 16th. More than 10,000 Communist troops in southern Shanxi launched a fierce attack on Quwo starting at 10:00 a.m. on the 15th, charging over a hundred times throughout the night. On the 14th, they turned to attack Mengcheng and Houma. In the past two days, National Army troops in Fenyang, Qin County, Ningwu, and other areas have also been attacked by Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 17th] After the order to cease military conflict was issued, the Communist forces attacking Yanzhou feigned a ceasefire on the morning of the 14th, withdrawing from the city gates. However, on the evening of the 14th, they scurried back towards the city gates and the vicinity of the train station and airport, constructing fortifications and confronting our defending troops across the city gates. At 5:00 a.m. on the 15th, Communist troops also used a detachment to create disturbances in the southwest corner of our city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 17th] After the Communist forces invaded Lianzhen on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, they continued to attack Dongguang. As of the morning of the 17th, the situation in Dongguang was unclear due to disrupted communications.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Military News: On the fourth day after the ceasefire deadline—the 17th—reports from commanders in various regions on the continued attacks by Communist forces on government troops in various regions are recorded as follows: Shandong Province (1) The Communist New Fourth Army, with a force of over 40,000, launched a fierce attack on the county seat of Tai'an on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway at noon on the first day of the new year (lunar calendar), destroying over 30 li of the railway. Chairman He Siyuan sent an urgent telegram to the Military Affairs Commission on the evening of the 15th, requesting that the responsible persons of the Communist Party be informed and that effective measures be taken to stop them quickly. [Jinan, 17th] (2) The Communist forces besieging Liaocheng are still fiercely attacking. Several sections of the city wall have been destroyed by their artillery fire. The Communist forces are also advancing towards the Zichuan train station. It is now reported that the mining areas in Xichuan and other places in Zichuan have been severely damaged again. [Jinan, 17th] Henan Province (1) Commander-in-Chief Sun reported to the Military Affairs Commission on January 16 that the government's 185th Division had been attacked by Li Xiannian's Communist forces since the 14th. In compliance with the ceasefire order, they retreated to Zhou Dangfan, 24 kilometers south of Luoshan, and an area 35 kilometers southeast of Xinyang. On the afternoon of January 16, the commander of the 185th Division reported that the Communist forces attacking the division that morning had sent envoys and formally notified them, saying: "The 7th and 8th Regiments of the Communist forces are ordered to be stationed in Zhou Dangfan."

<p>[Our Correspondent in Peiping, 16th] According to sources in the transportation industry here: The railway lines have been calm for the past two days, the 15th and 16th. Repair work on the Peiping-Hankou and Peiping-Liaoning railways has begun, and railway employees are all smiles. It is reported that of the 7,000 kilometers of railways under the jurisdiction of the North China Railway Administration, 2,000 kilometers have been damaged and are impassable. However, the actual length of the repair work needed only accounts for a portion of the 2,000 kilometers. If repairs are to be carried out, approximately 500 kilometers of rails, one million sleepers, and some bridge materials are needed. Although some of the required rails may be allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in the future, this is a case of "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst." The authorities have decided to resolve this issue immediately. It is heard that to quickly reopen the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the authorities plan to temporarily divert rails from a section outside Shanhaiguan and from the Linzao branch line in Shandong. The Railway Administration has not yet dared to estimate the time it will take to repair and reopen the railways in North China. However, the reporter has learned from various sources that, under favorable conditions, it is indeed possible to complete all repairs and resume traffic within two months. However, even after repairs, it will be difficult to restore the convenience of the pre-war period in the short term, as more than one-third of the locomotives in North China were destroyed by aerial bombardment at the end of the war. The restoration of domestic transportation to its original state still requires prompt and sufficient assistance from UNRRA.</p>

The allocation for Chahar and Rehe is still pending. The bank's future work is currently being studied and designed in detail. Last year, the enemy was unable to purchase the cotton from North China, and there are abundant cotton stockpiles in the rural areas. The bank is currently researching purchase methods.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Citibank and Chase Bank Accept Remittances to China <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] Citibank and Chase Bank have recently begun accepting remittances to China, with their Shanghai and Tianjin branches paying out in U.S. dollars or issuing New York sight drafts. The rate is temporarily set at 25 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar. It is heard that Mercantile Bank is also accepting remittances for disaster relief. Previously, remittances to China were handled exclusively by the Bank of China. The official exchange rate is 20 national currency units per U.S. dollar, plus a subsidy. With the introduction of this new method, those who originally purchased drafts from the Bank of China have switched to remitting through the aforementioned American banks, as the difference between the official rate and the black market rate is too large. Since the U.S. Treasury Department unfroze foreign funds in the United States and abandoned exchange controls on remittances to China last month, private commercial banks in New York have begun to engage in remittances to China.</p>

<h3 id="e14">United Nations Security Council Holds First Meeting Yesterday, Iran-Soviet Dispute May Be Resolved Outside the Council, Iranian Representative Prepares to Lodge Complaint with the Council <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 17th Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council held its first meeting here today. Australian representative Fraser served as chairman. British representative Bevin delivered a speech, stating that Great Britain is a democratic nation and has made great efforts and sacrifices to fight for human freedom in the past thirty years. In the two world wars, countless Britons sacrificed their lives for justice. Now that the war has passed, he hopes that the General Assembly can lay the foundation for world peace in the future. After Bevin finished speaking, British Prime Minister Attlee (formerly spelled as Atlee) stepped forward to shake his hand and congratulate him.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] The Security Council is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow. Today, Iranian representative Ender Chang declared that once the Security Council convenes, his country will ask the Council to resolve the dispute between Iran and the Soviet Union and prevent the Red Army from continuing to enter Iran. The United Nations Security Council is composed of eleven countries. The Soviet Union is one of the five permanent members and has the power of veto. It can prevent the implementation of any resolution of the Council. The Iranian case appears to be the first test of the Council's powers. The Iranian delegation received instructions from its government last night to lodge a complaint with the Security Council. It is rumored that Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi has resigned. According to Iranian representative Ender Chang, the delegation is unaware of this matter. However, if the Prime Minister does resign, the status of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly will be entirely determined by the new government of his country. This complaint to the Security Council is based on the broad principle of protecting Iran's territorial integrity and administrative independence against Soviet aggression.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] According to representatives attending the United Nations General Assembly: Before the Iranian representative executed the instructions of his government to submit the Azerbaijan issue to the Security Council, he made a final attempt at mediation outside the meeting last night. The majority of representatives from fifty-one countries took the Iranian issue as the topic of discussion, but the general debate of the General Assembly was not interrupted by it.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] United Press reporters asked Soviet representatives about the Iranian issue, but they remained silent and only replied, "We are unaware of the Iranian issue." The Iranian delegation hopes that the situation in their country can be "resolved amicably" outside the meeting; otherwise, they are determined to appeal to the Security Council.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 16th] In the next four weeks, the Security Council will seek to resolve four major issues: (1) The Council should submit a discussion and agree on the nomination of the "Secretary-General" candidates. (2) Determine the date of the first meeting of the military staff committee of the five countries (China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France). This staff committee will be a permanent subsidiary body under the procedures stipulated by the Security Council and will continue to perform its tasks. (3) After a general debate and resolution on the proposal submitted by the six countries to form an atomic energy committee, the Security Council will carry out the work of organizing this atomic energy committee. (4) Another major task is to jointly select fifteen judges of the International Court of Justice with the General Assembly.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced this morning that he intends to transfer British mandated territories in Africa to the Trusteeship Council for management. Last night, New Zealand also planned to entrust the Samoa Islands in the South Pacific to the Trusteeship Council, but still hopes to retain its administrative power over the islands. Bevin did not attend the morning meeting yesterday, and only arrived in the afternoon. When the list of speakers was being drafted yesterday afternoon, the name of the Soviet representative was still not seen on the list. The General Assembly hopes that the Soviet representative can participate in the discussion and express his opinions.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin declared to the General Assembly today: Great Britain has begun preliminary negotiations to transfer the three British mandated territories in Africa—Tanganyika, Togoland, and Cameroon—to the United Nations for trusteeship. The Palestine issue will be temporarily shelved pending further consideration by the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. Transjordan may become independent and cannot be placed under the trusteeship of an international body. Bevin's speech was the focus of attention at this morning's meeting. The meeting was then adjourned for the afternoon's Security Council meeting.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th Special Dispatch] British Prime Minister Attlee hosted a banquet for representatives from various countries at the Greenwich Royal Naval College tonight. British cabinet members and guests from all corners of the world sat together. In his welcoming address, the Prime Minister said, "This is a famous observatory, from which we obtain the accurate calculation of Greenwich Mean Time.

Our purpose here is to eliminate the divisions that exist within a larger framework of unity. I believe that this meeting is a symbol of harmony among nations. We have gathered here from all corners of the Earth to accomplish the unique and noble goal of world peace."</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 17th] The Red Army newspaper "Red Star" published a commentary by international observer Yemashiv today, saying, "The old League of Nations actually became an arena for great powers to compete. Various attempts are now being made within the United Nations to make small countries political tools of some great powers, which will be fatal to the cause of peace."</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] U.S. Fifth Fleet Commander Admiral Towers has been promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet. The handover will take place tomorrow aboard the U.S. battleship USS New Jersey in Tokyo Bay. Rear Admiral Sherman will take over the command. Towers will first go to Washington to consult with Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz, and then go to Pearl Harbor on February 1 to assume his new post.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] After President Truman announced that the United States would retain several Japanese islands, Senator Magnuson, a Democrat on the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, suggested today that the United States could acquire several British bases in exchange for a loan to England. As a result, discussions on the issue of U.S. outposts in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans in the future have suddenly surged again. Magnuson said that the United States should lease bases, regardless of whether they belong to enemy or allied countries. Acquiring British bases is necessary for U.S. defense. He said that this issue should be discussed before approving the loan to England. If the British economy would suffer as a result, he would not make this suggestion. However, most of the bases are on barren islands, so they have no commercial or military value to England.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 16th] President Truman stated that the United States will retain the strategic islands in the Pacific acquired from Japan for as long as necessary, but he did not specify which islands should be retained. According to a proposal by the U.S. Navy authorities in September last year, the United States should retain the Ryukyu Islands, Iwo Jima, Saipan, and Yonin. In addition, Wake Island, Midway Island, Eniwetok, Kwajalein, and Truk Island should also be retained to prevent them from being used by other countries.</p>

<p>Norway and Poland Representatives Claim: Fascist Poison Has Not Been Eradicated</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 17th] At yesterday's United Nations General Assembly meeting, representatives from four South American countries, as well as Norway and Poland, each elaborated on their country's position on various issues. Norwegian Foreign Minister Lie urged all civilized nations to assist peoples who have not yet achieved fully autonomous governments, stating that the trusteeship system is nothing less than a great charter of freedom. Within the United Nations framework, countries of all sizes, even those without direct interests, can work together to build a progressive new world. Polish Foreign Minister Litomoski, in a speech before yesterday afternoon's adjournment, advocated for a unified standard of culture through international joint planning to assist the development of less advanced nations. Representatives from Poland and Norway both warned at the meeting yesterday that the poison of Fascism has not been completely eradicated.</p>
<p>Mexican Representative's View: Five Powers Should Be Renamed Great Nations</p>
<p>The Mexican Ambassador to France, Diaz, speaking in English, said that people still harbor great anxiety caused by atomic energy. The five nations of Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China should not be called "Powers," but rather "Great Nations." Because of the convenience of modern transportation, Europe and the Americas are no longer separate, but are connected by the same blood and ideas. The concept of a colonial system no longer exists. Mexico, now holding a seat on the Security Council, is determined to work with other nations with the same resolve to resist Nazi Fascism, safeguarding peace within the principles of justice.</p>
<p>Argentina Acknowledges: Always Embracing the Democratic Spirit</p>
<p>The head of the Argentine delegation, Quintana, spoke, guaranteeing that his country would fully assist in the task of implementing the United Nations Charter. He stated that Argentina has always deeply embraced the democratic spirit and upheld the principle of self-determination for peoples. Regarding international judicial equality and non-interventionism, Argentina has recognized arbitration in the three re-determinations of its borders, and declared, regarding Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare, that the war should proceed according to the basic principles of international law. Now that the United Nations is convening a meeting to address international peace and security, a major responsibility rests upon each nation. Europe has suffered heavy bloodshed and lacks sufficient food, making self-reliance impossible. The Economic and Social Council's decision to collectively work on the world's material rehabilitation work will receive Argentina's great assistance in its realization.</p>

The future economic development of the world will depend on the degree of cooperation between countries.</p>
<p>The last speaker was the representative of Haiti, who strongly stated that although Haiti is a small country, it has great expectations for the United Nations to fulfill its mission, and Haiti is determined to fully support the principles of justice and fairness.

<p>[Reuters Washington, 17th] A State Department spokesperson said yesterday that the United States government hopes that Romania will return the territory it obtained from Vietnam in May 1941 to Vietnam, but this view should not be considered as supporting or opposing the pre-1941 borders between Vietnam. It is noted that Romania signed a treaty with Vietnam in Tokyo in May 1941, ceding a portion of Vietnamese territory, including a portion of Laos, northern Cambodia, land west of the Mekong River, and three-quarters of the province of Gongmingxi, to Romania. In 1943, Japan announced that it would transfer to Romania Belise, Qu, and Kedang in Malaya, and Qub and Qub in Myanmar.</p>

(2) In Honolulu, a spokesperson for the Rapid Demobilization Movement Committee declared that Eisenhower's statement that rapid demobilization would hinder the government's mission overseas does not include troops stationed in China and other Allied countries. The occupying forces should be limited to Germany and Japan, and stated that a delegation selected to represent Honolulu would testify before the Senate Military Committee's Demobilization Subcommittee. (3) In Manila, Army Chief Patterson flew to Manila from Shanghai yesterday and will be invited to speak at a soldiers' rally on the evening of the 17th.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Japanese Monk Kamasawa Competing with Hirohito for the Throne - Claims to be a Descendant of the Orthodox Imperial Line - Once Petitioned MacArthur to Allow Him to Ascend the Throne <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 17th] The Daily Telegraph reported from Tokyo today that Emperor Hirohito of Japan has recently met an opponent, a man named Kamasawa, 56 years old, who wants to replace Hirohito and ascend the Japanese throne. He has petitioned Commander MacArthur to restore the throne to the "true imperial line" and eliminate a "historical injustice." Kamasawa's request is quite surprising, but he has some documents that can prove that the imperial throne once held by his ancestors was seized by Hirohito's ancestors through conspiracy and assassination. It is said that there are also some ancient documents, now held by the imperial family and the family of Duke Konoe [who committed suicide last month]. Kamasawa's request today has been passed down through his family for five centuries. During this period, his family has attempted to claim the throne, and many have been subjected to assassination. Kamasawa's father was constantly threatened and monitored by the police, and his movements were restricted. Kamasawa himself, since his father's death seventeen years ago, has been constantly tracked and searched by the Japanese military police, forcing him to wander around the country, afraid to stay in one place for long.</p>
<p>[United Press Baltimore, USA, 17th] The Baltimore Sun's Tokyo correspondent, Cooklan, reported today that a Japanese monk named Kamasawa, claiming to be the Emperor of Japan, has petitioned MacArthur to allow him to ascend the throne, and has attached various documents proving that Hirohito's ancestors replaced Kamasawa's family as the Japanese imperial family 554 years ago. Kamasawa is 56 years old and lives in a city in southern Japan. His address is being kept secret until his personal safety is guaranteed.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Tokyo, 17th] Although Japanese politics, under the guidance and support of the Allied forces, are gradually moving towards democracy, the distance is still very far. At the same time, society and the economy are still very chaotic. Shuzo Ishiwatari, the Minister of the Imperial Household, a leading figure of the extreme nationalist faction, has resigned under the influence of MacArthur's political purge directive. He was one of the first to submit his resignation. His successor is Keimin Matsudaira, the eldest son of the famous Meiji-era politician Keiei Matsudaira. He is 65 years old and, after graduating from Oxford University, served as a Chamberlain in the Ministry of the Imperial Household. According to Kyodo News, Japanese right-wing parties have formed a joint front to counter the "United People's Front" formed by the Communist Party. Japanese right-wing elements are rallying under two slogans: (A) Amend the emperor system. (B) Democratize Japan's economy and finance. At the same time, socialist politician Matsumoto advocates dividing Japan into four independent republics. According to Matsudaira, this plan can prevent the resurgence of militarism and dangerous foreign policies, and can raise the living standards of the people. Regarding the Allied control of Japanese enterprises, it is reported that Japanese branch companies with head offices abroad have applied for permission to conduct limited property trading transactions. The Allied Headquarters has authorized the Japanese government to approve this. The quantity of Japanese agricultural products this year is less, and it is currently planned to purchase 30 percent of agricultural products to prevent the future disaster of a famine. In addition, Japan's malignant inflation is intensifying. The Ministry of Finance today denied the rumor of a national bank run. The Bank of Japan announced that as of January 10, the bank had issued 54,902,000,000 yen in banknotes, an increase of 637,000,000 yen since the end of 1945. The total amount of public bonds issued reached 37,478,000,000 yen, a decrease of 359,000,000 yen since the beginning of the year. In addition, after the Japanese government's announcement of the collection of capital tax, the market situation has been fluctuating, and merchants are vying to purchase goods to avoid the tax. The Bankers Association has advised its member banks not to speculate and hoard goods to alleviate the suffering of the people.</p>

<p>[United Press Tokyo, 17th] According to MacArthur's headquarters today, the United States has decided to appoint civilians, not military personnel, as judges on the International Tribunal for the trial of Japanese war criminals. MacArthur intends to select a lawyer with a high reputation who does not necessarily have experience, but must have a high position in the legal community. The judges from China and Britain have already been nominated and reported to MacArthur, but they will be announced together after the American selection is decided. The Soviet Union remains silent and has not yet contributed to the organization of the International Tribunal. The organizational law of the Tribunal and MacArthur's and Bar's agreements will be completed around the first of next month, and the trial can be opened. The indictments of the main war criminals in Sugamo Prison will be filed around the 15th of next month, and the first simultaneous trial will be of fifteen or twenty people, including Tojo.</p>

<p>[United Press Miami, 16th] Former British Prime Minister Churchill, who is here on vacation, said today in clear and resolute language: "I hope that the United States troops will not completely withdraw and return home. The number of other United Nations troops is not large and cannot handle the post-war European problems alone, and maintaining a garrison is essential, so that the fruits of victory will not be lost." I have always advocated partitioning Germany, but it has not been implemented. The United States should not announce the secrets of the atomic bomb until a legitimate world peace organization is established and can properly safeguard the atomic bomb. Previously, if the United States had joined the League of Nations, or had not joined but the US government authorities had taken a strong stance, the Second World War could have been avoided. Unexpectedly, the United States was led by weak and incompetent forces, causing the enemy to run rampant and triggering a catastrophe. The German military's rearmament could have been prevented without firing a shot. The German invasion of the Soviet Union was not unexpected. I had intended to issue a warning, but because I was not yet very close to the Soviet Union at the time, I stopped there." Churchill arrived here today with his wife on a special Havana train. He wore a V-shaped victory badge, was in good health, and was cheerful, blowing the ash from his cigar into the warm air of the sunshine. Churchill wore a brown tropical suit, and his tired and pale appearance had mostly disappeared. The American people gave this special figure a typical American grand welcome. After getting off the train, he drove quickly to the villa of Colonel Clark, the manager of the Canadian Steamship and Pulp Company, escorted by police and motorized troops. The sounds of horns were incessant. Churchill's host in America is Clark. The New York Times in editorial representing America welcomed Churchill, hoping that he rested and enjoyed the sunshine of Florida. They said that in recalling the past, when Britain resisted the Axis powers alone, Churchill bravely and resolutely took responsibility. His words not only inspired the British people, but also inspired the American people. He almost belonged to the American spirit.</p>

<p>[United Press Cairo, 16th] Regarding the Palestine issue, the Anglo-American Investigation Committee has completed its report in Washington and is preparing to go to Britain and the Middle East to continue investigating the Jewish demands for their ancestral homeland in Palestine.

<p>[Central News Agency New York, 14th Special Dispatch] Senator Green, Chairman of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, submitted a proposal today to establish a joint committee of both houses to study the issue of presidential succession. According to Green's proposal, this committee must submit concrete proposals by May 1 on who should succeed the President if both the President and Vice President die. The committee will also study the proposal for the people to directly elect the President through voting, rather than through electors. The reason for the renewed interest in changing the presidential succession is due to President Truman's frequent dangerous air travel (mostly to his family in Missouri) and Ambassador Be尔斯因's extended stay abroad due to diplomatic missions. According to current law, if both the President and Vice President die, the Secretary of State is promoted, followed by the six Cabinet members in order of their department's seniority. It is recalled that shortly after Truman took office as President, he sent a message to Congress suggesting that if both the President and Vice President died, the Speaker of the House of Representatives should succeed the President (currently Rayburn). If the Speaker of the House does not meet the qualifications stipulated by the Constitution, or the position of Speaker of the House is vacant, the President of the Senate should succeed (currently McKeller). Congress should also consider holding a special election to elect a President and Vice President to complete the term of the deceased President. President Truman crossed the United States to deliver the closing speech at the San Francisco Conference last June, and flew across the Atlantic to attend the Potsdam Conference the following month, posing a travel risk. Democratic politicians, in case of Truman's death, did not want the Secretary of State, S退丁斯, to take over as President, and proposed the above suggestion during his mission. The House of Representatives immediately took action on the President's suggestion at the time, while the Senate shelved it. However, the House's action was not thorough, only deciding to make the Speakers of both Houses of Congress the first and second choices for temporary President, and rejected Truman's other suggestion to hold a special election. The issue of presidential succession later subsided. Until yesterday, when President Truman braved bad weather and flew back to Independence City, causing a nationwide outcry, this issue was brought up again.</p>

<p>Taixian: Repelling Bandit Troops from Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>Although the War of Resistance has been won, bandits in various locations are taking advantage of the central government's incomplete demobilization to wreak havoc. Communist bandits in various counties of Northern Jiangsu, such as Yancheng, Yuhua, and Huaian, fell into their grasp before the arrival of the National Army. In December of last year, they concentrated bandit forces from Northern Jiangsu, Southern Shandong, and Northern Anhui, totaling about 20 regiments, with the intention of invading Taixian County. The vanguard of our army, the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Column of the 1st Route, led by Regiment Commander Wang Jian, inflicted a major blow on them. After nine days and nights of bloody fighting, Taixian was secured. This time, the invading bandit groups, led by Su Yu, Ji Luo, and Chen, with the 18th Brigade, as well as Gao, the Jiangdu Independent Unit, and over 20 other units, carrying heavy weapons such as direct-fire guns, first attacked...cut off...highway...Zhou.

<h3 id="e35">A Record of the Bitter Cold in Jinzhou <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— United Press Reporter, Fourteenth Dispatch</p>
<p>The northeastern provinces experience severe cold in winter, but in the lounges of major hotels here, there are still pots of verdant cacti and palm trees. The sight of them may be surprising, but whether indoors or outdoors, one is already so numb with cold that it is difficult to even be surprised. People may regard these small things as nothing. The Japanese managed the Northeast for fourteen years and almost succeeded in overcoming four thousand years of separation. In Jinzhou, there are two distinct cities: one is the old Chinese city, as ancient as the banner people on the Mongolian grasslands; the other is a brand-new, "Made in Japan" city, its streets and houses exuding a Japanese ambiance, gleaming like a silver dollar.</p>
<p>Jinzhou has always been a strategic location for military strategists. To enter the pass and directly seize the Central Plains, one must first control Jinzhou. It was here that the Northeast cavalry fought fiercely with the Ming Dynasty's army and civilians, because occupying Jinzhou was equivalent to controlling the gateway to the treasure house of the Central Plains. The Japanese, of course, saw this point, but the reverse was not necessarily true. Since November of last year, the Northeast Security Forces have occupied this city of 170,000 people, waiting for orders from above to move into Zhiyang. There are still thirty to forty thousand Japanese people here. Although they brought cacti and added new brilliance to the ancient city, it was all in vain. Life in the old city continues as usual, only the railway station in the new city, the textile factories, the wide, snow-covered streets, and the workers' residential areas show signs of war. Besides a few reporters shivering in the cold wind, there are no other Americans here. The most American thing is packets of "Camel" and "Lucky Strike" cigarettes, sold on the streets by Japanese children or Japanese women carrying babies on their backs. Some Japanese women still have short hair, like men, reportedly to avoid the "Russians." But whether it is effective has not been proven.</p>
<p>After dark, there are no pedestrians on the streets. A curfew begins at nine o'clock, and no one dares to go out. Chinese sentries, like sentries of other countries, would rather shoot first and then ask questions. They guard all night, without the slightest relaxation. The reporter was stopped and questioned by sentries twice in a short distance of two hundred yards. From their tone, one could tell their seriousness. Hearing such a shout seems to make one freeze. The reporter loudly replied "American," stating that the trembling should be attributed to the temperature of minus twenty degrees Celsius. These southern brothers under General Du are not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>This morning, six terrified Chinese youths were led down the street in handcuffs, soldiers with drawn bayonets escorting them. A Chinese staff officer told the reporter: "These are robbers, perhaps to be executed. We will decide their fate based on the severity of their crimes." This indicates that the days of rampant looting in Jinzhou are over. But the situation was very different a month or two ago. At that time, the civil war was active, and after the Eighth Route Army blew up bridges and houses, all damaged buildings, warehouses, and residences were looted clean. The city still retains an impression of fear.</p>
<p>Most of the shops are still closed. Business will only resume after the exchange rate between the Northeast Circulation Notes and the legal tender is determined. The textile factories are also shut down, resulting in worker unemployment. But the people of Jinzhou are strong and unyielding. They may not import cacti or similar plants again. The new city will soon lose its luster and blend with the old. The Japanese guests who have stayed for fourteen years will eventually be sent back to their hometowns. But this ancient marketplace will continue to live its old way of life. Conquerors come and go, and the people here have seen them come and go for centuries.</p>
<p>The National Army's recovery of the Northeast is progressing slowly, reportedly due to the authorities adopting a cautious attitude to avoid hindering the Changchun negotiations. No accidents have occurred between the Chinese and Soviet troops, which is the result of this caution. Taking Yingkou as an example, before the National Army entered, a certain Soviet military officer in Xinmin suggested to the Chinese side that Yingkou was an important place. "Why don't you Chinese troops occupy it?" This report was transmitted to Du Yuming's headquarters, and about two thousand soldiers were ordered to march to the area and safely recover it.</p>
<p>Yingkou used to be a troublesome place. Last autumn, when the US Seventh Fleet transported National Army troops to the area to attempt a landing, they were fired upon by Communist troops on the shore. Until recently, when the Soviet army opened a "green light," the National Army marched in, and four to ten thousand Communist troops scattered. Some of them even took refuge in the Soviet military headquarters in the city. A liaison officer of the Northeast Security Command inquired of the Soviet commander when he would leave Yingkou, who replied that he was awaiting orders from Changchun's Marshal Malinovsky. This indicates that the words of the Soviet officer in Xinmin do not entirely match those from Changchun. In this predicament, the National Army's actions are best taken with caution and strict adherence to the Sino-Soviet Agreement. (According to unofficial news, three thousand Communist troops have returned to Yingkou.) When the National Army can further enter Lushun, Dalian, or Harbin has not yet been agreed upon in Changchun.</p>
<p>The spokesman for the headquarters here still hopes that once the Soviet army completely withdraws by the fifth of next month, all important towns in the Northeast can be completely recovered. However, judging from the current slow progress, this is doubtful. Taking Changchun as an example, although it was the first major city in the Northeast that the National Army entered, the Chinese side's control cannot be said to be consolidated. The National Army airlifted from Beiping numbers only about fifteen hundred troops, of which a thousand are needed to serve as guards for the Chairman of the Nine Northeastern Provinces.

<h3 id="e36">The Secret History of the Japanese Puppet Tool, "Yiguan Dao," Under the Microscope <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— A Special Correspondent, Shao Shenzhi, Reports from Nanjing</p>
<p>The Wang Jingwei puppet regime grew under the wings of the Japanese invaders. Its extreme reactionary nature in political theory was clearly reflected in all its departments. It used so-called gangs and so-called religious activities to control the people in the occupied areas, dragging their lives and thoughts into the dark Middle Ages, attempting to enslave the national character and plunge it into an abyss of ignorance, numbness, superstition, and lack of knowledge. Chang Ni Yuqing's "China Anqing United Association" and Li Ni Bingqing's "China Hongmen United Association" were both effectively used as tools of their evil rule. What the reporter wants to particularly point out is the crime and terror of "Yiguan Dao." In the past four years, with the support of the Wang Jingwei puppet regime, it colluded with the "Anqing United Association," developed its organization, spread poisonous ideas, and had a severely negative impact. Moreover, it clearly undertook intelligence work for the Japanese puppets.</p>
<p>Headquarters Established in Nanjing</p>
<p>The area of activity of "Yiguan Dao" includes the provinces of North China, as well as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, and other provinces. Its headquarters are located in Nanjing, named Chonghua Hall, and its branch halls have different names. In Nanjing alone, there are more than thirty branch halls. In the past four years, its organizational work among the citizens of Nanjing has reached 70%. Its cover is "religion" and "charity." They once operated in the rear areas of the anti-Japanese war, but were severely banned by local authorities and repeatedly ordered to surrender, or else be arrested. It was suppressed by this kind of administrative order. However, in the occupied areas, it continued to expand its organization.</p>
<p>Why did the Wang Jingwei puppet regime make every effort to support "Yiguan Dao"? Just examining its "theoretical" basis makes it clear. The chairman of the Nanjing General Hall of "Yiguan Dao," Chonghua Hall, is Chu Ni Minyi, and the directors are Peng Ni Nian, Zhang Ni Xiangfu, Zhou Ni Xuechang, Li Ni Yunwu, Ge Ni Liangshi, and others. In 1944, Chu Ni Minyi paid the hall 450,000 yuan in the name of "merit." This is a matter that can be verified by documents.</p>
<p>The Absurd Doctrine of "Yiguan Dao"</p>
<p>What is the so-called theory of "Yiguan Dao" (including its "outlook on life" and "teachings")? It must have such a theory as a cover in order to carry out its conspiratorial activities. From a religious standpoint, it propagandizes that other religions (mainly launching an offensive against regular Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity) should convert to "Yiguan Dao." Therefore, it first establishes a chaotic, absurd, and shameless doctrine to the extreme, bringing together a great collection of reactionary, superstitious, and retrogressive ideas. Regarding the origin of "Yiguan Dao," it claims, "Laozi said: 'The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth. Before there was heaven and earth, this Dao existed.' Fuxi drew the trigrams, and the Great Dao descended. The Yellow Emperor wrote the Yin Fu Jing, and began to reveal its wonderful meaning. Later, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou successively received the lineage of the Dao, passing on the inner method to each other, until Confucius. Confucius said, 'My Dao is consistent.' Zengzi said, 'Yes.' Thus, it was passed on to Zeng Shen. Zengzi then passed it on to Zisi, and then to Mencius. Later, the Confucian lineage died out. Fortunately, Western Buddhism flourished. Shakyamuni passed it on for twenty-eight generations to Bodhidharma. Bodhidharma entered China, and the Great Dao was still passed down in one line, as the first ancestor. Afterwards, it was passed down to the Sixteenth Ancestor Qingxu, and the Dao was passed to Donglu. The Three Teachings were united, and Ancestor Gongzhang emerged to succeed him." This is simply nonsense. Who exactly is the so-called "Ancestor Gongzhang"? It is Zhang Tianran, whom "Yiguan Dao" falsely calls "Master." He is from Jining, Shandong, his whereabouts are uncertain, and he is in close contact with the great traitors of the puppet organization. The actual person in charge of the Nanjing General Hall is his son, Zhang Yi, known as the "Daoist Leader." In addition, the organization has "Dian Chuan Shi," who preside over the planchette writing. There are also clerks, communicators, accountants, general affairs personnel, and other positions. There are many "Dian Chuan Shi." They take boys and girls, around the age of ten, who have received special training, to set up altars and conduct planchette writing everywhere, called "Ban Dao." Planchette writing is their basic tool for spreading poisonous ideas.</p>
<p>The god they worship is "The All-Knowing, All-Powerful, Pure, Void, Most True, Most Holy, Three Realms, Ten Directions, Myriad Spirits, True Sovereign," and they have a spirit tablet for him. But in order to simplify things, they created a character "申" to replace it, like a sideways-written character "母". Or they call it "Wu Sheng Lao Shen". It is impossible to calculate the variety and quantity of propaganda that "Yiguan Dao" spreads.</p>
<p>The printing and paper of the propaganda materials are very exquisite. One booklet, "Persuading Followers of All Religions to Return to the Right Path," falsely claims that "Wu Sheng Lao Shen" ordered "Western Paradise Guide Buddha," "Jian Ci Tian Zun Xian Tian Zu," "Islamic Lord Muhammad," and "Jesus Christ" to descend to the altar and write planchette writing, persuading followers of all religions to convert to Yiguan Dao. Its conspiracy is clearly to destroy general regular religious culture and drag people into the extremely reactionary abyss of "Yiguan Dao" in order to strengthen the rule of the Japanese puppets.</p>
<p>In a booklet titled "Provisional Buddhist Rules," it says: "European winds have come to the East, and science is revered. The code of ethics of the former kings is swept away, and the etiquette of the sages is abandoned. Therefore, negative energy swells, yin and yang are at odds, disorders follow each other, and disasters arise, leading to an unprecedented catastrophe. The current extreme disaster is, as the former sages said, 'calamity is created by people, and the principles of numbers make it so,' which is not false." This is completely justifying the cruel slaughter by the Japanese puppets in the occupied areas. It also says: "Since I (Zhang Tianran referring to himself) have cultivated the Dao, I have never been involved in politics. I have only been correcting people's hearts, speaking of benevolence and righteousness, emulating the ancient sages and worthies, and only discussing sacrificial vessels and fragrant offerings. However, the Dao has never been easily transmitted, so I strictly follow the altar instructions of Lord Guan Sheng. The procedure for seeking the Dao slightly takes into account the merit of the seeker to verify the truthfulness of belief, and uses small funds to brush books and print teachings, or to receive visitors and help the poor. There are no donation rules." What kind of face does Yiguan Dao actually wear? This is quite clear. The lead-printed booklets that the reporter has seen also include: "Compilation of Ethical Principles and Moral Standards," "Golden Admonitions for Awakening from Delusion," "Three Teachings Reaching Understanding," "Guide to Enlightenment," "Elixir for Transforming into Goodness," "Questions and Answers about Yiguan Dao," "Beginner's Guide to Yiguan Dao," "Simple Words of Reason," "New Introduction to Guandao," "Sacred Teachings of the Three Teachings," "True Commentary on Yiguan," "Mixed Yuan Cloth Bag True Scripture," "Essential Words for Explaining the Dao," "Must Read for Yiguan Cultivation," "Records of Yiguan Debate," "Discussion on the Five Rules of Cultivation," "Guide to Awakening the World," "Yiguan Buddhist Mother Scripture," "Collection of Yiguan Sacred Instructions," "Compassionate Voyage Golden Mirror," "Must Read for Yiguan Female Practitioners," "Life Rules of Yiguan Dao," "Bodhidharma's True Transmission," "Annotated Vernacular Explanation of the Great Learning," "Records of Manifestation of the Ziguang Tongle Class," and more than a hundred other types.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Social Affairs believes that the Chonghua Hall of "Yiguan Dao" is a religious group being exploited that usually spreads rumors and deceives the public, and harms public morals. It was disbanded in accordance with the law. The Ministry ordered the China Ljiao Society to temporarily keep the houses and equipment at No. 187 Jianye Road and No. 99 San Mao Palace for processing. However, disbanding it alone is not enough. These presiding members must be arrested and interrogated to thoroughly eliminate the poisonous thoughts. The large number of documents I have collected are enough to prove all of their poisonous activities! What is particularly noteworthy is that, in addition to "Yiguan Dao," there are so-called "Tianxianhui," "Yixin Tiandao Huahuang Jiaohui," and "Zhonghua Xiantian Dao," etc., which, although they have disappeared after victory or have been disbanded, it is worth studying whether they are peripheral organizations of "Yiguan Dao."</p>
<p>Beautiful Warrior with Flowers, Awaiting Her Ship Home to America</p>
<p>A Big Surprise Entering Forbidden Territory</p>
<p>The reporter, accompanied by Xu Lin, a specialist from the Ministry of Social Affairs, visited No. 187 Jianye Road. This is the location of the General Hall of "Yiguan Dao," which has always been a secret forbidden area. After it was disbanded by the Ministry of Social Affairs, security police were assigned to guard it. As I walked to the door, I felt like I was walking into a demonic lair described in "Sword Hero Novels." The building is oriented in reverse, with a total of three courtyards separated by two courtyards in the middle. When entering, one must walk along a cement path about fifty meters long, with high walls on both sides. Staggered dwarf evergreens are planted on the sides, giving a somewhat eerie feeling. The two main doors are wrapped in iron sheets, nailed with dense iron nails. After we rang the doorbell, we waited a long time before the security police slowly came out from inside and opened the door.</p>
<p>The furnishings inside the house surprised me. All the furniture, including beds, couches, tables, stools, and desks, were made of rosewood with fine workmanship. This was the first time I had seen such luxurious furnishings in Nanjing. In particular, bronze bells, ancient porcelain, and jade chimes were everywhere. The walls were covered with marble and rosewood screens, and there were rich Buddha implements. The painted rafters and beams were like flowers. It really didn't look like an ordinary charitable organization. It is said that "Yiguan Dao" used the organizational and political pressure of the puppet organization to amass considerable wealth, and has successively transferred it to those so-called Daoist leaders and Dian Chuan Shi, turning it into private property. The fact that only two of the more than thirty branch halls are now being taken over by the Social Affairs Ministry, well illustrates this point.</p>
<p>After walking through the path, I turned right and then right again to enter the house. At this time, the doors of two houses were open. At the door were brick columns, painted bright red, and on the top of the door was a pattern of "Bottle Rising Three Battles." Inside the door, on a white screen wall, was a large red character "福" (good fortune), hiding behind wisteria. Turning left here, one passes through a round doorway, with a red-bottomed black-character seal-script horizontal plaque above it, one side saying "Gate of Morality" and the other side saying "Purple Qi Comes from the East." Entering the round gate, there is a courtyard. To the right is the path to the offering hall, and to the left is the clinic of "Yiguan Dao." In the middle, an offering hall is set up with spirit tablets. A couplet is written on it: "The sixteen-character heart transmission of the sacred domain all returns to Yiguan; The thousands of words of Xinmin Mingde are taught to save the multitude." The back is where the "Master" lives, which even those who have entered the Dao cannot go to, only great traitors can enter and exit. The size of the house is the same as the offering hall, but what is offered in the middle is not a spirit tablet, but four screens and a couplet written by Kang Youwei. It seems to be dedicated to enshrining the handwriting of this leader of the 保皇 party. To the left of the hall is the bathroom and toilet, and to the right is where the "Master" lives. I saw secrets in these two places. In the middle of the small table in the bathroom, I found a large pile of draft planchette writings written by elementary school students. The interior of the bathroom is extremely refined, with plumbing facilities. The "Master"'s room contains more ancient porcelain, bronzes, and jade articles, although most of them are imitations, they are all of good quality.</p>
<p>Secret Discovery in Camphor Chest</p>
<p>In a camphor chest with a coiled dragon, a large number of perfumes, powders, and clothing materials were found, as well as many new women's shoes and menstrual belts, and a draft telegram from the puppet organization's police agency. What is especially important is the draft of a letter signed "Shi Bi" from Beiping to Sun Ni Xiangfu, a member of the puppet military commission, which reads:</p>
<p>"...Friends in Beijing and Shanghai have repeatedly urged me to travel south, and I also intend to travel south to meet with you and recount our long separation, which has always been my desire. However, due to many troublesome matters, I have been unable to make the trip early. Recently, many matters in the north have been added for me to handle, making it impossible for me to travel south. I will wait for the future. I arrived in Ping on the 23rd of this month, and everyone is safe and well. After starting, I received the big note you forwarded to me, which made me very happy. It said that you may be assigned to an important position in Guangdong again. You consider the inconvenience to the Dao, which is very good. However, it is an order of the government, and there is no way to refuse. As for Chonghang asking you to go with him, your intention not to go with him is very good. However, we should understand the times in this extraordinary situation. As for the idea of bringing Chen ashore, it shows that you have planned carefully. I hope you can discuss it with Lizi and handle it. Yours sincerely! Shi Bu (April 23)."</p>
<p>This shows the relationship between "Yiguan Dao" and the puppet organization.</p>

<p>These days, American army transport ships have been arriving at American docks, and military bands often play the tune "Here Comes the Bride," and the number of times they play it is indefinite. This is forgivable, because many army ships and even merchant ships have recently been carrying batches of American soldiers' brides. However, these batches are not enough to satisfy the American soldiers who are husbands. To date, only 10,000 foreign new brides have arrived in the United States, while there are as many as 60,000 women who married soldiers overseas. As for those who are engaged, it is even harder to count.</p>
<p>The brides come from all over the world where the U.S. military has been stationed, but the problems they face when they arrive in the United States are the same. They all have to adapt to the rules and customs of this new world. Considering the many difficulties in getting married overseas, it is amazing that so many people have found a good match. However, it is worth pointing out that some marriages have many setbacks and are quite annoying.</p>
<h3 id="e38">They Remember Their Old Home and Suffer from Homesickness <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Naturally, they also miss their homes. Almost everyone suffers from severe homesickness. However, some brides, who are already mothers or pregnant, don't miss their homes as much because they have other things on their minds.</p>
<p>Among the brides whose husbands are abroad and who work in the city, a typical figure is Mrs. Romano, a beautiful twenty-one-year-old woman born in London. She was a member of the British Women's Land Army.</p>
<p>Mrs. Romano said about the first time she and her husband met in a "Camp Hotel" in Dunmow, Essex, England, "Another American soldier was teasing one of my girlfriends, and he came over kindly and stopped him, and that's how we met."</p>
<p>In April 1944, one year after they met, they got married. Shortly after the marriage, Private First Class Romano was transferred to France and Germany. Mrs. Romano has not seen him since. She is now a clerk in a bank in New York, and she likes living in the United States. Another, even more Americanized, is Mrs. Carney, formerly Miss Lanrik, a twenty-five-year-old from Nottinghamshire, England. Mrs. Carney worked in an armory, speaks "American," and loves the U.S. infantry unit nicknamed the "Brooklyn Diggers." She said, "I'm not patriotic at all, but I only love the American infantry."</p>
<h3 id="e39">I Am Not Patriotic At All, Only Love American Soldiers <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Another office worker is Mrs. Rainey, formerly Miss Huth from the Renfrewshire region of England. Mrs. Rainey is twenty-four years old and worked in the British Air Ministry. She met American soldier Rainey in a London air-raid shelter during an air raid in 1943.</p>
<p>The majority of overseas brides, about 90%, come from the British Isles and the Antipodes of New Zealand, but they are not necessarily the easiest to Americanize. Private First Class Prlechev's nineteen-year-old wife, Suria, with her autumnal eyes, had spent the past few years of her life entirely in the desert war. She is a resident of Hamlif in Tunisia, North Africa, and is very clear about the Nazis, because the Nazis had been in a village near her home for six months, sometimes fighting and sometimes playing. She said, but later because "they were, as you say, annoying - I never thought about them again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Prlechev, like most soldiers' wives, said that she met her husband "at a party." Her only regret is that he speaks French very well, which has prevented her from learning English well. Although she admits that she often misses her home and plans to go to Tunisia once after the war is over, she likes everything about Americans. She summarizes her impressions by saying, "I like America very much, the women are all friendly, and I like the men very much."</p>
<p>The foreign wives of officers have more generous incomes, so there are fewer problems.</p>
<p>After the war ends, the biggest problem will be how to bring a large number of overseas brides to the United States with their husbands. There are now 40,000 husbands in the United States waiting for their brides.</p>
<p>Due to the intensification of demobilization, the first priority is to transport the soldiers who went overseas to fight. Therefore, the transportation of the soldiers' families has become even more problematic. The U.S. Army, the State Department, and Congress are currently considering new ways to bring the brides to the United States as soon as possible.

<p>The Ping Shan Airport Incident in Kowloon</p>
<p>Editor-in-Chief: Recently, the British have been forcibly building an airport in Ping Shan, Kowloon, for three months, and there has not been much activity in the newspapers. This fact is something that the people of the country are angry about, and it is a major event that should require the government to quickly stop it. It is especially necessary for the public opinion to loudly call for and urge it. It is well known that your newspaper speaks for the people and says what people want to say and dare not say. I hope you will launch an appeal to live up to the expectations of the people. (Reader, Chen Guozhu, respectfully)</p>
<p>Please Pay Attention to Pawnbrokers' High Interest</p>
<p>Editor: The end of the year is approaching, and the poor rely entirely on pawnbrokers to tide them over. It is found that pawnbrokers in this city, because the puppet currency depreciated and inflation occurred, the interest rate per yuan rose to thirty-one cents, plus a storage fee of fifteen cents. So, each time you redeem one yuan, you have to actually pay forty-six cents in interest. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, all industries are adjusting, but the rich pawnbrokers' interest rates have not been reduced. Therefore, I borrow a corner of your newspaper and implore the authorities to adjust the interest rates of pawnbrokers, which will benefit the people, and is not insignificant.

<h3 id="e42">Financial Rehabilitation Issues in Recovered Areas <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Mujie</p>
<p>Currently, there are four major problems urgently needing resolution regarding the financial rehabilitation of various cities in the recovered areas:</p>
<p>1.  Re-establishment of Financial Institutions. While Shanghai experienced a period of financial chaos and stagnation, followed by recovery through reorganization, businesses did not suffer greatly as a result. However, cities in the interior deeply felt the inconvenience of financial paralysis. All transactions required cash as the medium of exchange. Before the war, financial institutions in these cities were primarily money shops, commercial bank branches, and branches of national banks, all of which were dismantled during the war. The newly established institutions were registered with the puppet regime. After the victory, all were legally shut down for review. However, most of the pre-war money shops in these areas have closed down and show no sign of reopening. Furthermore, the original branches of national banks and commercial banks have been slow to resume operations. This has not only made it difficult for local businesses to obtain financing but has also hindered the flow of capital from other regions.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the current financial stagnation in various cities is that national banks are focusing only on a few large metropolitan areas, neglecting other cities. Commercial banks are eager to restore their original branches in these cities, but delays in the application process to the Ministry of Finance and slow postal service have left branch managers waiting to be dispatched. They are well aware of the strong desire of local businesses for the re-establishment of financial institutions, but they are powerless due to legal procedures.</p>
<p>2.  Counterfeit Currency Exchange. The slow progress of counterfeit currency exchange is undeniably in urgent need of correction. In Shanghai, the initial counterfeit currency exchange work was entrusted only to the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China) and the two Central Trust of China and Postal Savings &amp; Remittances Bureau. After the addition of four smaller banks with government ties and appeals from various sectors, more exchange locations were established, and ongoing money shops were authorized to handle exchange as agents. However, for over two months, a large amount of counterfeit currency has continued to exist and circulate in Shanghai. In cities in the interior, it is even more so a world of counterfeit currency. Of course, the unit of accounting for all businesses has been changed to legal currency, but the habit of pricing in both legal and counterfeit currency has almost become ingrained in merchants and the general public. Today, almost all transactions in these cities are conducted using counterfeit currency. A bolt of cloth or a bale of yarn is bought and sold with piles of counterfeit currency being tossed around like waste paper!</p>
<p>One might ask, "Aren't there counterfeit currency exchange institutions in these cities?" Yes, there is! Only the post office is exchanging counterfeit currency, or perhaps a branch office of a provincial bank at most. Because these institutions are not specifically dedicated to counterfeit currency exchange, but rather handle it as an ancillary function, how can they actively carry out exchange work? Moreover, when exchanging, merchants or people must categorize the denominations and designs of the counterfeit bills, accumulating a certain amount before they can exchange them for legal currency. This is far less convenient than pushing them around in the market. How can it produce a significant exchange effect? Therefore, counterfeit currency naturally continues to flood the market, and when the exchange is eventually cut off, the people will cry out in hardship!</p>
<p>3.  Lowering Interest Rates. Before the war, interest rates were between 1% and 1.5% per month (10-15 per thousand), which is 12% to 18% per annum. At that time, anything exceeding 20% per annum was considered usury. During the war, with skyrocketing prices, the profits from business were extremely high. Creditors gradually increased the interest rates they demanded from debtors, and debtors, due to the high business profits, were willing to borrow at high interest rates. As a result, financial institutions had to raise deposit interest rates proportionally to attract social capital, otherwise, they would not be able to absorb social funds. Naturally, as the tide rises, the lending rates of financial institutions would also have to be multiplied the deposit rates. Therefore, the trend of interest rates rose from 2% per month to 20% per month. In Shanghai, some money shops nominally charged interest rates of 20% per month, but because interest was deducted in advance, it amounted to 25% per month (commonly known as "large two-and-a-half points"). Interest rates in Shanghai are now tending to decline, to around 8% per month, but interest rates in cities in the interior are still very high.</p>
<p>In the past, interest rates in various cities were two to three times higher than in Shanghai. Hearing that interest rates are only 20% or 15% per month may seem lower than Shanghai, but in reality, they are not calculated monthly but every ten days, amounting to as much as 45% to 60% per month! After the victory, with the removal of enemy puppet control, smoother transportation, unprofitable speculation and hoarding, and a downward trend in prices, interest rates have gradually fallen, but are still high compared to pre-war levels, even higher than the current high interest rates in Shanghai. Furthermore, due to the small number of financial institutions resuming operations and the difficulty of financing, interest rates are not consistent, currently ranging from 10% to 15% per month. The high interest rates are preventing businesses from engaging in legitimate economic activities.</p>
<p>4.  The Problem of Closed Financial Institutions. As mentioned earlier, all financial institutions in various cities during the war were registered with the puppet regime and are now being legally shut down for review. This is, of course, without issue. However, the pre-existing money shops and branches of national banks and commercial banks have not yet resumed operations, creating a gap. The financial institutions that are shut down for review seem to see a glimmer of hope and are taking the opportunity to conduct underground bill discounting and lending while undergoing review. All of this is documented but has no legal basis. They believe that it is better to operate secretly than to obtain security or legal status to operate. Therefore, under various pretexts (some of which are justified), there is a trend of demanding to resume operations or re-establish themselves.</p>
<p>In summary, although there are four problems with the financial rehabilitation of various cities today, the fundamental solution lies in the rapid re-establishment of legitimate financial institutions. The lack of legitimate financial institutions prevents the counterfeit currency exchange from unfolding, hinders the turnover of industrial and commercial capital, makes it difficult to lower market interest rates, and causes closed financial institutions to demand to resume operations. Furthermore, financial stagnation also affects other sectors of the economy, preventing them from accelerating their recovery and transitioning to peacetime economic development. Currently, financial authorities seem to be focusing too much on the financial rehabilitation of urban areas and forgetting the financial rehabilitation of cities surrounding urban areas. Financial authorities should quickly correct this distorted phenomenon in the recovered cities.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Speculative Gangs Arbitrarily Raise Prices: Gold Prices Rise Another 60,000, US Dollar Follows, Hong Kong Notes Continue to Fall; Rumors Spread That Gold Savings Certificates Will Be Settled in Cash <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, rumors spread that the current term of gold savings certificates would expire and no longer be paid in cash, but would be settled in cash. This sparked various speculations. Securities brokers, having absorbed enough shares in recent days, intended to continue their efforts. As soon as they had the opportunity, they made their move. Early in the morning, they continued the momentum from the previous evening, wildly raising the price to around 920,000. This price was bought by a Mr. Wang from the paper industry, using it to prove the actions of the previous evening. However, silver shops sold off their physical gold, and high-priced sellers gathered. At this time, the US dollar, with the physical goods of the money exchange shops selling off, became looser and looser. The spread against gold reached 618 yuan per ten taels, and there were many arbitrage sales in the gold market, so it gradually declined. However, the long and short sides fought fiercely over the 900,000 mark for a long time. Finally, due to excessive artificial manipulation, profits were taken from all sides, and it fell below 895,000. The afternoon closing was 895,000. After the closing, stock and bond brokers continued to buy, deliberately raising the price again and again, and returned to 933,000. In the afternoon, spot prices hovered between 925,000 and 932,000. Large brokers watched eagerly, hoping to take the opportunity to make a killing. However, the Sichuan bankers had a high price to sell, and it was still difficult to move until the banks closed. As a result, it rose 63,000 compared to the previous closing. Silver jewelry was 99,000, silver bullion was 700 yuan, silver dollar was 460, and private discounts were tight due to the securities brokers focusing on the gold market, but interest rates were still about 9 to 12%.</p>
<p>The US dollar was not affected by the wild price increase of the gold price by the paper certificate traders. The foreign exchange industry sold its physical goods as soon as it entered the market to get profits. The 1,500 yuan mark was not penetrated. The securities traders, who were bullish at the end of the year, instead supplied the market one after another. Afterwards, the gold market stepped down due to the arbitrage sale from the US dollar side, and the US dollar followed the gold market. However, the trend was still mediocre, falling to 1,455 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold market was still manipulated and raised wildly, and the US dollar was also brought up to 1,505 yuan. Until 3 o'clock, it hovered around 1,490 yuan. As a result, it rose 63 yuan compared to the previous closing. Hong Kong old banknotes were slightly stable, and the result was a recovery of 5 yuan. New banknotes continued to fall, with the lowest price of 76 yuan for the "one" series and 74 yuan for the "two" series, and then slightly pulled up. The result was still a drop of 1 yuan. Because there were no short positions in the US dollar that could be squeezed, and because the speculators filled out the market, special attacks were made on the spot, and the spread had the potential to rise to 650 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Public Bonds Rise and Fall, Many Bulls Close Out, Voices Are Heard in the Market, Stocks Also Show Fatigue <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Public bonds, after the wild rise the day before yesterday, were filled with bankruptcies and fugitive clients in the industry. The industry originally had no legal organization, and whenever there was a storm, it collapsed repeatedly. Yesterday, there was not much trading in the market, and the long and short sides sought to close out on their own. Category C bonds opened miserably, falling to 1,500, and outside capital still rushed in, raising it to a new high of 2,000 yuan. This price has reached the price that will be paid with customs duties in the future. The bulls seemed satisfied and closed out one after another. At noon, it had fallen below 1,700, and the noon closing was 1,750 yuan. Transactions were sporadic. As a result, it rose slightly compared to the previous closing, but it fell back a lot compared to the dark market the previous evening.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks, although they received the help of the gold market yesterday, still rose, but the major shareholders' inventories have been exhausted after being released in recent days. Concentrating on the spot, the stock market only relied on retail investors, which had a gloomy feeling. At noon, they all hovered at low prices. As a result, Yongsha fell by 50 yuan compared to the previous closing, Mei Ya was average, and Xinhe was also the same. The three small hot stocks were slightly softened. Starting today, the Chinese stock dark market will move to the 7th floor for meetings.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks initially rose high and finally fatigued, still being influenced by the Chinese stock market. Yisha gradually fell from 3,900 yuan, British Union from 5,100 yuan, and Yipi at 1,350 yuan. Paper industry stocks hovered around 1,100 yuan, which was quite stable. Jardine Matheson was extremely stable yesterday due to the excessive decline the day before yesterday. At noon, the result compared to the previous closing was that Yisha continued to fall by about 100 yuan, Yipi paper industry stocks were the former flat and the latter old fell by 100 yuan, Jardine Matheson rose slightly, rubber stocks were average, and the situation may stagnate.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Opposition to US Cotton Price Limits Strengthens <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 17th] The New York cotton market opened steadily yesterday, rising slightly by 3 pounds in the afternoon. After the news, the atmosphere of opposition to price limits strengthened, and the closing situation was still calm.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The US Department of Commerce announced that the export volume of cotton yarn in the first quarter of 1946 was approximately 5,500,000 pounds.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Cotton Fabric Sales Are Very Strong <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Han merchants purchased shilin bleached cloth and blue cloth, but the spot goods could not meet their expectations, so they could not do as they pleased. Striped poplin from the Sichuan merchants was very popular, and customs declarations and shipments were unusually busy in recent days. However, Changzhou and Wuxi 12-pound fine cloth was flat because there were more goods on the market, and dyeing and weaving factories were also unwilling to use it because the fiber quality was not good. Yesterday, the market reported 70,000 yuan for shilin Meiting, 65,000 yuan for chicks, 64,000 yuan for Prosperous Dreams, 50,000 yuan for Dingruyi bleached cloth, 37,000 yuan for special mainland blue, 35,000 yuan for ordinary mainland blue, 36,000 yuan for Flying American aviation blue, 34,500 yuan for Daming striped poplin, 40,500 yuan for longtou fine cloth, 26,000 yuan for Changzhou fine cloth, and 29,000 yuan for Wuxi fine cloth.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Silk Industry Unanimously Prosperous, Artificial Silk Rises Frenetically <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Rayon fabrics hit new records. Yesterday morning, one case of 120 bridge rayon sold for 1,145,000 yuan. The price was called out at 1,170,000 yuan in the middle, and it reached 1,200,000 yuan in the afternoon. Because the price was too high, buyers generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. In the morning, the smallest warehouse receipt was 870,000 yuan, the price was done at 910,000 yuan in the middle, and the highest price was 950,000 yuan in the afternoon. Buyers all gave up cash and sought warehouse receipts, so there were many transactions. Manufacturers did not have much honor or disgrace. They were 230,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Silk fabrics showed fatigue in the market price the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the market suddenly rose again, exceeding the high price on Tuesday. In this fierce rise in raw materials, the calculation of silk fabrics is the cheapest, and there is a profitable point to be gained. Everyone pays attention to absorption, resulting in this rising trend. Meiya bed covers were 745,000 yuan per hundred, Dachang Gebi crepe was 2,180 yuan per yard, and Minsheng jacquard satin was 10,500 yuan per piece. The above are all transaction prices.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Deposits and Remittances Are Prohibited from Being Accepted by Banks [Reported by This Newspaper] In the past two days, the financial market has been stirred again. General speculators have also rumored that when the new exchange rate is announced, its price will be higher than the current black market. Therefore, some merchants did not know the truth and bought foreign currency from the black market, and a few banks may have accepted foreign currency deposits and converted foreign currency cash into telegraphic transfers or postal remittances. The Financial Commissioner in the Beijing-Shanghai district yesterday specially and solemnly notified the Municipal Banking Association, the Money Shop Association, and various foreign banks: "It has been found that the country's foreign exchange policy is currently being planned by the government as a whole. Before it is announced, all banks shall not open foreign currency deposit accounts for ordinary customers, and shall not accept foreign currency cash for regular remittances or foreign payments. Please follow these instructions immediately and transfer them to all banks and money shops to comply, do not violate them."</p>
<h3 id="e48">Coal Market Stable, Pine Firewood Retail Sales Smooth <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The rising trend of bituminous coal chunks is gradually easing, because they have risen continuously for days, and there is inevitably a virtual rise in the middle. It is difficult for importers to start, and they all intend to wait and see. The sales of bituminous coal dust are slightly smoother than before. The market for white coal screened chunks is slightly erratic amidst sluggish sales. The trends of small coal and coal dust are still flat. Charcoal has arrived from various places, especially steel charcoal, but because the price is cheap, sales are still active. Retail sales of pine firewood are very strong, and the market situation is firm. There are currently fewer shipments of chestnut firewood. According to industry insiders, a large number will arrive from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway in two or three days.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Japonica Rice Rises, Soybean Oil Falls <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The rice market is actively digesting, and it has risen by another two or three hundred yuan. White yuan indica rice has also risen by two or three hundred yuan following japonica rice. The oil market's appetite has weakened, and soybean oil has fallen by a thousand yuan. Crude oil has also fallen by five or six hundred yuan. The opening was still possible early in the morning. The closing suddenly saw a decline. Soybeans are firmly positioned, soybean cakes are flat, raw peanuts are high and stagnant, sesame is flat, and flour prices are strong due to the absorption of Hunan and Hubei merchants, adding more than a hundred yuan. The market is very active. With the end of the year approaching, the source of Jiangbei liquor is scarce, and the shop has a strong appetite, rising another five hundred yuan. The market trend is strong.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Wool Continues to Rise <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Wool continues to rise due to the successive purchases of the Sichuan merchants. The numbers in the market are all buying mutually, and common shops that sell men's and women's clothes are also purchasing, in addition the price of gold and the other goods are rising, so the price of wool is still going up. Also, because there is a lack of inventory and the factory is recovering production and the goods owners are hoarding goods, especially those common goods and clothes for the Spring/Summer that has a light color has an especially strong trend.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Tianjin Merchants Absorb in Large Quantities, Tea Market Trends Strong <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The tea market in this city has been trending quite sharply in recent days. The actual sales buyers are particularly surged, especially after the Tianjin merchants have been unable to handle the goods for a long time, the local tea reserves are extremely rare, and the prices are 60% to 70% higher than those in Shanghai. The tea merchants in Shanghai are all benefiting from this. All the shopkeepers on this street are also adding stock frequently because the Lunar New Year is approaching, but it is found that the inventory in this city is not abundant, so the holders are reluctant to part with it, resulting in the continued show of prices with insufficient supply. Some flower colors have risen more than the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Tallow Tree Oil Rising Trend Unabated <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The incense and candle business has been booming for the past week, and the tallow tree oil, which is the raw material for candle making, is not enough for each candle to use. They re-purchase in large quantities. The insiders did not prevent the sudden arrival of the sales place, resulting in the sales emptying in the past few days, and had to purchase from various production areas, but now the Hangzhou call came, Shanbai oil has risen to 19,000 yuan, and Jiaxing's car oil has also increased by 25,000 yuan, all delivered on the spot, so starting today, the insiders will sell Heben oil for 27,800 yuan, Shanbai oil for 22,300 yuan, and Sichuan white wax because the traffic is not smooth and the source is interrupted, inventory has dried up, selling rice heart accounts for 600,000 yuan per market load.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Spinning Construction Continues to Sell, Yarn Market Sentiment Stable <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was still firm, and customers from Beijing and Hangzhou came to purchase. Although the amount was not large, it was quite lively. The support was good for 10,000 pieces, and the sentiment was also very stable. Because red gold and US dollars have both seen gains, if the Spinning Construction Company had not been supplying and selling for days, the soaring price of yarn would not have been behind others. The Spinning Construction Company continues to sell in large quantities, and most of the buyers are silk factories, cotton weaving factories, and retail stores. The company's opening price is the same as the previous day, and there is no increase or decrease.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Summary of Business Conditions <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Dyes: There are still sporadic transactions with customer merchants purchasing, such as dyes for drawing green fishing boats, etc., which are about to be shipped. The market situation is passing through in peace.</p>
<p>Caustic Soda: After rising sharply for days, customers temporarily took a wait-and-see attitude. The opening price was slightly lower, and the transactions were sparse. The potential of white wax is still strong, and white oil has fallen in price due to the arrival of goods.</p>
<p>Dried Longan: Recently, the owners of the goods intend to return and sell the goods on the market, and the market situation has turned loose. Xing Siyuan opened 42,000 yuan to 41,400 yuan.</p>
<p>Northern Goods: Yesterday, the market was quiet, with only one batch of Longpin flour opened, falling to 100,000 yuan. Ordinary Southern Peaches opened at 23,000 yuan, and the goods were of lower quality. The rest were just priced and not transacted.</p>
<p>Wood: Yesterday, the prices of various grades of wood rose due to the sharp rise in gold prices, which stimulated the sentiment. Sellers were waiting and not selling, and the transaction was quite sparse.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: The factory's distribution of goods is connected, and the actual sales are sluggish, so the transaction is not strong. The market situation rose slightly in the morning, and there was not much change in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Education Authorities Indicate to Our Reporter [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Hankou] Education authorities in Hubei Province recently told our reporter: Hubei Province became a battlefield in the past, universities moved to Sichuan, and educators, except for those with special aspirations, all stepped back. As a result, teachers and equipment are lacking.

(2) School buildings at all levels have been damaged and should be repaired. If financial resources allow, they should be rebuilt, but school buildings must be reasonable and applicable. School equipment at all levels cannot be perfect, but must meet the minimum requirements. (3) Strengthening teachers at all levels, including the assessment and review of existing teachers, the absorption and cultivation of excellent teachers, and special attention should be paid to the increase of simple normal schools and normal schools in the establishment of schools. (4) In order to meet the requirements of national reconstruction, attention should be paid to the training of technical cadres. Vocational schools such as agriculture, industry, commerce, and medicine will be added as much as possible this year. (Important)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Recent News on Battlefield Youth Recruitment and Training: More Youth Trained in Nanjing, Shanghai Refresher Courses to Open Soon, Wuhu to Establish Vocational Classes <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing] The Battlefield Youth Recruitment and Training Committee, directly under the Executive Yuan and chaired by Minister of Education Zhu Liuxian, is responsible for recruiting and training battlefield-displaced youth. The committee is located in Chongqing and has established registration offices in Nanjing, Shanghai, Ping, Anhui, and other recovered areas since the victory against Japan. It recruits displaced and out-of-school youth for relief and training. Since the Nanjing office (Director Liu Shaozhong) was established on Jingxi Road, youths from various places have registered, and those who have passed the review and are high school or university graduates have been sent to temporary university preparatory classes for remedial studies. More than 200 people (more than 70 actually registered) have been sent to temporary university preparatory classes. Since the establishment and opening of these two classes, high school students and above will no longer be recruited.</p>
<p>Nanjing Training Institute As for middle school students, those registered from various places, such as Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Shanghai, together with the Nanjing registration office, total more than 1,000. Except for 300 students who have undergone short-term training and been assigned to the three National Temporary Middle Schools in Nanjing, there are currently 400 students receiving training at the Nanjing Shigu Road Youth Training Institute. After receiving considerable training, these students will also be sent to National Temporary Middle Schools to study. There are still hundreds of students under registration and review. Once the review of various procedures is completed and suitable school buildings are found (the training institute is full), they will be assigned for training.</p>
<p>Shanghai Refresher Class In Shanghai, the committee also has an office in Shanghai and has established a registration office. Hundreds of students have registered. A refresher class will be temporarily established in Shanghai for training and will be expanded later. A temporary middle school will also be established to accommodate more students. The refresher class is scheduled to start on January 15.</p>
<p>Wuhu Vocational Class In Wuhu, a vocational training class will be established, offering agriculture and commerce (commerce including banking, accounting, bookkeeping, typing, etc.) courses. High school students who urgently seek self-reliance and hope to receive vocational training can be sent to vocational classes instead of being assigned to temporary middle schools. According to another report: The Battlefield Youth Recruitment and Training Committee has recently merged with the War Zone Guidance Committee and has been renamed the Youth Education and Employment Guidance Committee of the Ministry of Education. Hereafter, branch offices in places such as Shanghai and Beiping will also be renamed Guidance Offices. (An)</p>

<p>Decisions to be Made on Tuition Fees</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The principals of private primary and secondary schools in this city held a meeting at the YMCA on Monday (14th) to discuss the tuition fee standards for the next semester passed by the municipal government meeting. The next day, they sent representatives Jiang Jizhou, Wei Dunyi, Sun Xiangqian, Yu Chuanding, and Xu Zhicheng to present their opinions to Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau and Mayor Qian. Today (18th) at 2:00 PM, Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau will host a tea party for principals of private primary and secondary schools in the bureau's auditorium, and decisive opinions on the collection of tuition fees will be announced.

<h3 id="e62">Brief Reports <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Xianchu has been appointed by the Zhejiang Education Department as the director of the Provincial Hangzhou People's Education Center, and Zhou Boping has been appointed as the director of the Provincial Hangzhou Sports Ground.</p>
<p>The Anlan Senior Vocational School, established to commemorate the late Lieutenant General Dai Anlan, who died in the Burma Campaign, had its board of directors ordered to come to Shanghai to prepare for the school's reopening. It has now designated 150 Hainin Road as the preparatory office and is actively starting work to prepare for the school's reopening in the short term.</p>
<p>The Private Daozhong Girls' Middle School in this city was founded solely by Cui Jianwu. After the January 28th Incident, it moved from Zhabei to its current location. The original lease was indefinite. After the August 13th Incident, the original owner suddenly transferred the property to Zhou Bangjun, a traitor, who used the power of the enemy and puppets to exert pressure repeatedly. Later, the property rights were transferred to the enemy-affiliated China Revitalization Co., Ltd. (Yangxing) for custody, causing repeated harassment. After the victory, Zhou Wenji, the legal representative of the Star Perfumery Factory (founded by Zhou Bangjun), has not changed her old ways and still hopes to repeat her past tactics. The school rents seven buildings in total and has sincerely offered to sign a lease with her, but Zhou only agrees to a six-month lease and requires a monthly rent of 70,000 yuan per building. Such a high rent is rare and her ulterior motives are self-evident. Now she has formally filed a lawsuit, scheduled to be heard on the morning of the 19th. The schools and the Shanghai Education Association School Building Maintenance Association are jointly advocating for justice and have jointly submitted a petition to the Shanghai District Court for relief.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Office of the Battlefield Youth Recruitment and Training Committee has recently discovered that some public and private students in various places are attempting to obtain public funding by confusing the situation. It has specifically requested the Municipal Education Bureau to instruct the principals of public and private middle schools that students are not allowed to leave school without reason, and certificates are not to be issued arbitrarily.</p>

<p>The Chen You Cup Basketball Tournament, Group A, is nearing its end. Tonight's two games, as usual, will start at 5:30 PM. The first game is Donghua vs. Xiexing. Judging from their records, the latter is expected to win. However, Donghua's hard-working style is well-known, and an upset is not impossible. Xiexing's players must be careful.</p>
<p>Starting at 6:30 PM, Shan Team will meet Green Forest. Besides tonight's game, Shan Team only has the final decisive battle against Hualian left. The team has won all eight games and is arrogant and invincible. The young players of Green Forest have also been improving rapidly, and their strength should not be underestimated. However, their disadvantage is their height and experience. Therefore, it is difficult to expect them to win, but the performance will be exciting, as can be expected.</p>
<p>An additional friendly match will be held as the finale at 7:30 PM, with the Expeditionary Force Black and White Team facing Chen You Red. The two sides are evenly matched and a fierce battle is sure to ensue.</p>

<p>The Expeditionary Force Black and White Basketball Team's third battle in Shanghai was held last night at 7:30 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium against Hualian. The audience was more crowded than the previous two games, and the shouts were continuous. Referees Di Xianzhang and Wang Jien blew the whistle to start the game. Wu Chengzhang of Hualian shot first, breaking the basket. Bao Songtu followed up with a successful shot. Chen Tieyan of Black and White refused to be outdone and also scored. Zhang Liangxiong and Xu Jusheng of Hualian suddenly became active, and Black and White fell behind. After Hualian led 14 to 4, Hualian neglected defense, and the visiting team took the opportunity to rise. Therefore, at the end of the first half, Hualian only led by one point, 18 to 17.</p>
<p>After switching sides, Li Zhenzhong of Hualian took the field, and his momentum increased sharply, scoring seven points in a row. Black and White only scored through Chen Tieyan. However, the score was difficult to close. Hualian led all the way, and at the end of the game, they defeated the Expeditionary Force 41 to 25.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Memories of Returning to Jiaotong University <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>On this New Year's afternoon, I leisurely walked near the gate of Jiaotong University, stopped by the bridge, and couldn't help but recall the chaotic and panicked scenes that occurred on this bridge in November 1937, when the National Army retreated westward. At that time, many of our lower-level employees were running around in a hurry, trying to rescue school property. The off-campus dormitory, located on the edge of the former French Concession in Shanghai, suddenly became a warehouse for miscellaneous goods. The Guangxi soldiers standing guard at the corner of Haig Road and Hongqiao Road stared blankly at the crowds of people coming and going, frequently entering and leaving the barbed wire, filled with chaotic, panicked, and uneasy emotions. Now, nine years later, I have returned to the old place, and seeing the crowds gathered in front of the school gate, smiling, all happy, surviving the disaster, the feeling is doubly increased!</p>
<p>Stepping Through the School Gate of Eight Years Ago, I read the long banner welcoming Jiaotong University alumni, and dragged a group of children through the palace-style gate walls that I had not dared to look at directly for eight years. I don't know where the long row of bamboo fences perpendicular to the school gate has gone? The first and second eastern dormitories and the girls' dormitory still stand dilapidatedly. I skillfully entered the No. 5 dormitory in the second eastern dormitory, where I had lived for seven or eight years, the birthplace of two children. The doors and windows were completely destroyed, and the floor was incomplete. It was truly a scene of desolation. I can still imagine the location of the wooden cabinets, chairs, tables, and many scattered objects that I did not have time to move when I fled in a hurry. Several rows of new houses in a 口 shape have been added to the South Model playground. The bronze statue of Sheng Xuanhuai in the school is probably turned into bullets now. The old music classroom is still intact. The school road, which was not completed with asphalt paving ten years ago, is still a piece of yellow earth. The South Dormitory has been leveled and no longer exists. The gymnasium has become a stable. The isolation room is full of Japanese prisoners, who are noisy and laughing, as if they have forgotten the shame of defeat. The Ferguson sports field, which was originally a shallow grassland, vast and far-reaching, is now dirty and desolate, full of traces of enemy riding.</p>
<p>Dusty, Gray, Withered, and Pitiful The Zhixin West Residence, formerly known as the Palace, is dusty, gray, withered, and pitiful. The engineering hall also has incomplete doors and windows and four obvious cracks. The more complete one is Rong Hong Hall, which has not lost its former appearance. The face of the big clock on the clock tower of the Upper Institute has a skylight. Ten years ago, someone surveyed the entire building and believed that the wall foundation was tilted and would collapse soon. In the past eight or nine years, it has been able to stand still, becoming an incredible miracle. The appearance of the Middle Institute has changed slightly, and although it has been painted, it still cannot compensate for its aging state. Most of the teachers' residences in the one, two, and three-entrance Western-style houses are eroded and damaged, with no sign of their former spirit. Several new houses have appeared on the tennis court. The library is still nestled against the earthen mountain, with dry tears and an empty stomach, eagerly hoping that people will give it nourishing food. I toured the entire school for a week, wandered around, paid my respects, and compared the present with the past. I truly felt like I was in another world!</p>
<p>The Scene That Day Was Extremely Chaotic Standing on the stone steps of the library, I looked up at the sky and recalled that on November 9, 1937, enemy planes flew horizontally and vertically, bombing the Xujiahui and Longhua stations, intending to threaten the transportation of the National Army's retreat. The planes flew low, passing over the clock tower of the Upper Institute. In groups of three or five, the sound shook the soul. The panic in the whole school was beyond description. At that time, all the heavy machines in the school that could be dismantled were transported elsewhere, but the surveying and various small experimental instruments, and all the appliances in the offices, were not transported in time. Because the school was located in the area of the road built beyond the border, there was a danger of falling at any time. Chinese people have always been known for protecting themselves wisely. The whole school suddenly fell into a state of anarchy. Our middle and lower-level employees each acted on our own, requesting small workers from the General Affairs Office in order to rush to transport objects. The number of small workers was not large to begin with, but at this time, it was even more insufficient to allocate, and the urgency of the situation increased its crisis every second. In a state of panic and helplessness, I rushed to the South Model Middle School, which had been converted into a refugee camp, and pulled more than a dozen young men, who were given subsidies by the General Affairs Office and instructed to help transport things. The day was short and the night followed.</p>
<p>Sighing at Each Other, Unable to Do Anything After such chaos for a few days, the French Concession authorities agreed with the enemy that all Jiaotong University school property, those inside were not allowed to go out, and those outside were not allowed to enter. French and Japanese police were stationed at the school gate, prohibiting the removal of objects. School personnel had moved to the school's off-campus dormitory to work, separated by Haig Road, staring blankly at the school gate. Many daily necessities had not been completely rescued. We sighed at each other, unable to do anything. Because I lived on campus, I had not been able to rent a house off campus. Only when the situation was critical did I take my wife and children, take some boxes, suitcases, and bedding, and take refuge in the off-campus dormitory, entering the school during the day to cook, and leaving the school at night to sleep outside. There were still many objects that had not been taken out, and public justice and personal feelings were intertwined in my mind. At this time, Li Shuhe, the dean living in the three-entrance Western-style house, moved out with his family. There were still scattered objects in the house. A complete set of rosewood chairs and tables was stored on the fourth floor of the Middle Institute, which was quite valuable and could not be moved out. He repeatedly entrusted the law, almost in despair, when he suddenly met a graduating student, Huang Zhangbin, who took advantage of his job in a Western construction company to borrow a British merchant's truck and hire a White Russian as a driver at a high price.</p>
<p>Drifting, Deprived, Destitute, and Helpless At a certain noon, many small workers were pre-stationed at the road test laboratory, engineering hall, civil engineering department, and three-entrance Western-style house, waiting for the opportunity to rush to transport. Huang and I waited for the gate guards to be slightly relaxed, and drove straight in, urgently loading all the equipment from the road test laboratory out of the school, via Xiafei Road, Yaozhujiao Road, and Taistolang Road, to the side gate of the off-campus dormitory, unloading and driving away as we went. Then, we entered the school and loaded out many pieces of woodenware from the engineering hall. Then, we entered the Middle Institute and snatched out more than a dozen chairs and tables. Because there were too many appliances waiting to be loaded, the truck body was still not big enough. It was estimated that my furniture would be loaded on the fourth trip. At this time, more and more units in the school came to contact us to transport objects. People were moving, running, and shouting. The French police pretended to be deaf and dumb, but the Japanese army was obviously irritated. When the truck entered the school for the fourth time, it was blocked, and the White Russian driver was slapped. We escaped in the meantime, and after that, we could not enter the school. Wandering on the street, I saw the clothes and comforters I had left in the Second East Dormitory being taken out and sold by someone I didn't know, and I could only stare blankly. Thanks to the understanding of the former French Concession authorities, our school was able to move to the basement and fourth-floor classrooms of Aurora University, and we hastily resumed classes. From this time on, we middle and lower-level employees, who could not disassemble words or practice boxing, lived an extremely difficult life of drifting, deprivation, destitution, and helplessness.</p>
<p>The Sky Shines Again, Thrilled to Frenzy Fortunately, the sky shines again, allowing me to return to the school gate, to affectionately and lovingly wander in every place worth commemorating, watching the cars, tricycles, and group buses carrying a large number of alumni, flooding into the Wenzhi Hall and Rong Hong Hall like a tide, signing, having tea, holding meetings, laughing, I truly felt thrilled to frenzy! Or perhaps because the environment has worn me down too much in the past eight or nine years, they no longer recognize me, and I am too lazy to greet them. I unintentionally met several groups of employees who were eager to restore the school. They asked me very kindly what news I had. I said, haven't we all found jobs? That's enough to be proud of. Because I couldn't comfort their enthusiasm, I hurriedly dragged a group of children out of the school gate in a mood of regret and nostalgia. Behind me, a whirlwind suddenly rose and conveyed the enthusiastic and violent applause from the Wenzhi Hall.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Methods for Converting Puppet Currency Capital: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Submits Opinions by Telegram; Former Shareholders May Pay Additional New Shares <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's preparation of methods for converting puppet currency capital, it telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday, stating: "We believe that since Shanghai's industry and commerce were forced to use puppet currency in recent years, the value has fluctuated frequently, and the situation is extremely complex. How to convert back to legal tender has a significant impact on the interests of industry and commerce. Our Chamber's Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee has repeatedly invited representatives from various industries and relevant experts to conduct thorough research. On December 3rd of last year, we submitted Document No. 161 to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for preliminary filing, with the intention of submitting a request for adoption after reaching a conclusion.</p>
<p>Based on Estimated Net Asset Value: Now, after collecting opinions from various research sessions and considering both facts and legal principles, we have summarized them into five points: (1) If the capital was originally legal tender and later converted to puppet currency, but the capital was not increased or decreased, the capital should be restored to its original amount in legal tender. (2) If the capital was originally legal tender and later converted to puppet currency, and the puppet currency capital was increased, the net value of the existing assets should be estimated in legal tender. If this net value is sufficient to cover the original amount of the book value of the puppet currency capital, it may be converted to legal tender at the original puppet currency amount. If it is insufficient, the investors should supplement it with sufficient legal tender or reduce the capital amount. (3) If the capital was puppet currency from the beginning, it should be handled in accordance with the second item above. (4) For companies that increased capital after August 13, 1937, former shareholders who were unable to participate in the subscription of new shares may, within a specified time limit, supplement the new share payments in proportion to the original capital and the currently determined capital amount. Those who are unwilling to supplement or underpay will be allowed to do so. (For example, if a company's original capital was 500,000 yuan, and it later increased to 5 million yuan, and the current estimated value determines the capital to be 5 million yuan, and a shareholder's original old shares were 50,000 yuan, and they were unable to subscribe for new shares at the time of the capital increase due to transportation difficulties, they may now supplement the new share payment of 450,000 yuan within a specified time limit, expanding the company's capital to 5.45 million.)</p>
<p>Old Shareholders' Meeting as the Main Body of the Company: (5) However, before the new and old shareholders have completed the registration procedures for capital increase and reorganization in accordance with the provisions of (2) and (4), the old shareholders' meeting shall remain the main body of the company. When disputes arise between the new and old shareholders regarding their rights and limits, they shall be handled in accordance with the Company Law and other relevant laws and regulations. New shareholders who are unwilling to participate in the reorganized company will also be allowed to withdraw. Their withdrawn shares will be assumed or transferred by the old shareholders, or the total capital of the company will be reduced.

<h3 id="e71">Director of the External Intelligence Department, He Fengshan, Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>He Fengshan, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai on the 15th of this month. Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, he met with reporters and stated: "Regarding the illegal return of the French traitor Jacques Coppin by the French warship 'Dumont d'Urville,' the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a report and has made a serious protest to the French Embassy in China. The Sino-French relationship has always been close, and this action by the French side is unwise." Subsequently, when reporters asked whether incidents such as Allied soldiers in China being drunk and disorderly or causing accidents while driving should be handled by the Allied military authorities in China, Director He replied: "These incidents should be handled by the Allied military authorities in accordance with the law. This is an international practice based on the principle of mutual respect and mutual benefit. For example, if similar incidents occur in India and Burma involving our expeditionary forces, the authorities in India and Burma will also send the offending officers to our side for handling. This cannot be equated with consular jurisdiction." Director He continued: "I will be staying in Shanghai for about ten days this time, and I am eager to meet with people from all walks of life in the Allied countries to discuss issues related to diplomacy."</p>

These wharves have been occupied by the enemy and puppets for eight years, and the damage has reached more than 80%. Even the remaining 20% needs to be thoroughly repaired before it can be officially used. Now, due to the increasing accumulation of river mud, it is negotiating with the Dredging Bureau to dredge. The office has recently organized the registration of private wharves and warehouses in order to manage the entry and exit of ships and goods and maintain order at the wharves.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper News] The second batch of Liberty ships (the Victory ship) prepared to be taken over by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, originally scheduled to take over one ship first yesterday, named the "Hai Su," originally the "Qichita Falls." On December 30 of last year, it loaded relief supplies from the United States to Shanghai. After unloading, it moved to the Pujiang River in front of the Qiuxin Iron Works in Nanshi. The remaining Liberty ships and the Victory ship are also moored there, awaiting transfer orders. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the crew members assembled on time at Pier 3, carrying their personal belongings, waiting quietly for departure. The company also assigned the Guoli launch to specially carry the recipients. Waiting until 11:30 a.m., due to the salary issues of senior crew members, the Navigation Association and the Marine Engineering Association jointly negotiated with the company to improve the situation. Until 4:00 p.m., they still did not get anywhere, so they all left one after another, and the takeover work was suspended due to the crew's salary issues. As for the captains' names of the six Victory ships, the first four ships were announced the day before yesterday, and the captains of the "Hai E" and "Hai Xiang" were announced yesterday. The "Hai E" is Shen Dacai, and the "Hai Xiang" is Zhu Shaogang.</p>
<p>Four Ocean Liners Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: According to news from the transportation industry yesterday, the four ocean liners transferred to China by the United States, the "Horton," "Philadelphia," "Orchard," and "Fall," have arrived. However, the relevant parties receiving the ships have not yet received a telegram from the United States, so the takeover has not yet been carried out. These four ships are oil tankers, each with a capacity of about 3,000 tons.</p>
<p>American Liner Sails Directly from Shanghai to New York: The Sino-American Pacific route, after the Victory, is operated by the American President Lines, the Flay Shipping Company, and the American Mainstay Shipping Company. Traffic has been open for a long time. However, most of them are cargo ships, with Seattle as the starting and ending point. It is now learned that the "Onwaro" of the American President Lines is scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to New York on the 22nd. This ship is the first ship from Shanghai to New York after the Victory. The "Pickelman" (transliteration) of the Flay Shipping Company arrived in Shanghai from Seattle yesterday, berthing at the Mitsubishi Wharf in front of the north end of the Waibaidu Bridge, with 180 passengers and no cargo, and is also the first passenger ship on the Sino-American route.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Shipping Increases Shallow Water Fee: The water level of the Yangtze River is receding very quickly. According to the shipping industry, a telegram was received from Hankou yesterday that the water level yesterday receded another three inches compared to the previous day, totaling four feet and four inches. When the Chengping ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was launched and passed the Madang blockade line on the 15th, it was found that the bottom of the ship made metallic noises. With a water level of twelve feet, navigation was difficult, and cargo was loaded at half capacity. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Sanbei Company increased the shallow water fee by 50% yesterday. Once the river water rises, the shallow water fee will be canceled immediately.</p>
<p>Yisheng Company Expands Shipping Business: The Minsheng Industrial Company is currently planning to establish a large-scale new shipyard. In the near future, the company authorities will fly to the United States to negotiate with the "Shipbuilding King" Kaiser Shipyards to purchase the latest shipbuilding and repair machinery for application. The Shanghai branch has also recently negotiated with the Dredging Bureau to find suitable factory sites in the Pudong area and actively prepare for the construction of the factory. The US government, in order to assist the company in its reconstruction work, has agreed to lend a huge sum of US$15 million for the purchase of ships. As for the original plan to purchase 18 ships from Canada, in addition to the four ships that can sail directly to China, the remaining ships still need to be assembled and constructed, which is time-consuming and lengthy. Therefore, it is now considering pre-leasing several existing ships to sail to China for urgent use. Recently, it has also reached an agreement with Jardine Matheson, a British company, to lease its wharves and warehouses along the Yangtze River, including Yichang, Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Nanjing, and Zhenjiang, for berthing and storage. Currently, the shipping rates are designated by the Ship Allocation Committee, mainly between Yichang and Hankou. The "Minyi" ship that came to Shanghai from Hankou and the "Minhe" ship that arrived in Shanghai from Yichang yesterday, in addition to loading a portion of public goods, were both here for repairs and did not carry passengers or cargo.</p>

<p>The strike by French water and electricity workers worsened suddenly yesterday morning. The labor side firmly stated their unwillingness to cooperate with capitalists who colluded with the enemy and puppets, while the company authorities, prioritizing their own interests, cut off electricity to all tram lines. The Municipal Party Committee and the Social Bureau are still continuing mediation efforts. Military and police authorities, in order to maintain local security, dispatched officers to Rue Cardinal Mercier (呂班路) and Avenue Dubail (薛華立路) all day to maintain strict vigilance and prevent disturbances. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Electricity Cutoff Disrupts Traffic: Starting at 6:00 AM yesterday, the company, citing the significant impact on revenue from long-term free tram rides, devised a plan to cut off electricity to all tram lines, causing both trams and trolleybuses to be unable to leave the depot, bringing traffic almost to a standstill. Subsequently, with emergency efforts by workers, twenty red public buses were dispatched, assigned to routes 1, 24, 22, 18, and 4, with nine buses on route 22, five on route 1, three on route 18, and three on route 24. However, they continued to refuse to sell tickets.</p>
<p>Labor Expresses Unwillingness to Cooperate: Labor representatives Zhu Junxin and others stated that the French water and electricity authorities colluded with the enemy and puppets during the Shanghai occupation. Therefore, they firmly expressed their unwillingness to cooperate with the capitalists again, unless the Chinese government takes back this public utility and manages it itself, in which case they would resume work unconditionally.</p>
<p>Military and Police Deployed for Strict Vigilance: The Social Bureau, the Municipal Party Committee, and others convened labor and management yesterday for negotiations, but no result was achieved by evening. Military and government authorities, in order to maintain security, dispatched personnel led by Chen Tongyao of the Garrison Command, Zhu Hongyu of the Police Bureau, and Zhou Shangyi of the Taishan Precinct to the scene for vigilance.</p>
<p>Workers Submit Nine Demands: Over 2,500 workers of the French Water and Electricity Company of this city previously submitted nine demands to the factory management:</p>
<p>(1) December wages must not be further reduced.</p>
<p>(2) A bonus of 20 days more than last year should be issued. The already issued 30 days is not satisfactory.</p>
<p>(3) The regulations for annual increases in basic wages and for increasing basic wages to the specified level within the prescribed years should be implemented according to the stipulated standards, and the statistical table should be published.</p>
<p>(4) For employees with salaries of over 120 yuan, the salary calculation method should be based on the cost of living index.</p>
<p>(5) The matter of allocating premises for the trade union, which has already been approved, should be promptly implemented.</p>
<p>(6) The approved cancellation of the contract labor system in the accounting section of the Transportation Department should be implemented immediately, and the service of the 31 personnel in that section should not be suspended.</p>
<p>(7) The 20 dismissed unemployed workers should be given priority for re-employment.</p>
<p>(8) Clarification should be provided regarding the lack of standards for issuing annual bonuses and the inexplicable deductions.</p>
<p>(9) Meter reading personnel in the Business Department should be issued winter and summer uniforms.</p>
<p>Mayor Hopes for Resumption of Ticket Sales: At 3:00 PM yesterday, Mayor Qian, along with Ge Kexin, Acting Director of the Social Bureau, and Wang Xianqing, member of the Municipal Party Committee, convened labor and management for mediation. Shen Baokui, representative of the Public Utilities Bureau, Wang Zhengmin, specialist of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Li Jianhua, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Bureau, and Zhu Hongyu and Zhou Shangyi, representatives of the Police Bureau, were all in attendance. Acting Director Ge first conveyed Mayor Qian's wishes, hoping that the labor side would resume ticket sales today, and that the management side would open the electricity supply, allowing the trams to continue running. Unresolved matters would be handled by the Social Bureau. Wang Xianqing also advised the employees to resume work first. Kurtley, Director of Personnel of the management side, stated that the labor side's demand for a two-month annual bonus was unacceptable and said that the company's administration was conducted in accordance with the authorities' intentions. Subsequently, after deliberation by Committee Member Wang and others, a compromise solution was reached: employees would borrow one month's salary from the company in advance and repay it in installments, but the management side did not agree. The meeting continued until around 6:00 PM with no results. Acting Director Ge and Committee Member Wang will consult with Mayor Qian and then conduct further mediation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Association telegraphed all members of the Political Consultative Conference yesterday, stating: "At a time when all countries in the world are working to maintain lasting peace after the war, we are pleased to hear that the National Government authorities will also convene a Political Consultative Conference in the wartime capital of Chongqing on the 10th of this month, to gather excellent plans for reconstruction and nation-building, and lay the foundation for universal politics. What this conference is related to is not only a turning point for strengthening the nation, but world peace is also tied to it. Reading through the opinions of all parties announced at the conference in recent days, it is unanimously agreed that the realization of democratic politics and the strengthening of national defense are the prerequisites. And to strengthen national defense, we must focus on industrial construction, which is indeed a crucial area that takes both the root and the branch into consideration. However, now that the country has just been restored and the whole people are looking forward to the implementation of policies to complete economic recovery as soon as possible and to relieve the people of the heavy burden of taxes, so that they can gradually reach the path of national prosperity and strength, and then achieve the construction phase. The association respectfully represents the national goods factories of the entire city of Shanghai, and telegraphed requesting the conference to place concrete plans for economic recovery at the forefront when discussing national affairs, and to eliminate all obstacles to economic recovery, so as to alleviate the people's difficulties and benefit construction. This sincere contribution is deeply expected, and we hope that it will be adopted and offer our sincere congratulations."</p>
<h3 id="e87">American Soldiers Demanding to Return Home Organize Soldiers' Committee; General Wedemeyer Has Approved It <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The marches and demonstrations by American soldiers demanding to return home began with the arrival of the US Senate investigation team and ended with the departure of US Secretary of the Army Patterson. Most of those demanding to return home this time are soldiers working in the air force. They are all career soldiers who enlisted during the war and are completely different from the standing army of the United States, so they urgently hope to return home after the war.</p>
<p>Specifically Studying Return Matters: General Eisenhower's speech in Congress on the 14th of this month clearly stated that anyone with enough points can leave the army in April this spring. After this speech was published, the soldiers knew that they would have to wait a while longer, but as a result of discussions by these more than 700 soldiers over the past few days, they have formed a soldiers' committee dedicated to studying the matter of returning home, which has been approved by General Wedemeyer, and they will meet once a week. The committee also issued a founding declaration, stating the reasons why they demand to return home, namely that they have nothing to do in China, which makes perfect sense. However, the senior American authorities here do not seem to be paying much attention to these aftereffects.</p>
<p>Number of Officers and Soldiers in the US Headquarters: According to a report from US headquarters, there are currently 1,081 American officers and soldiers in the US China Theater Command headquarters. And the most interesting proportion is that among these thousand people, there are six generals and six corporals. The six generals are General Wedemeyer, General Casey, General Matte, General Middleton, General Landrum, and General Binkley. Except for General Landrum, who works in Chongqing, the other five all work at the US headquarters in Shanghai. The other numbers are as follows: 69 colonels, 63 lieutenant colonels, 75 majors, 110 captains, 145 first lieutenants, 87 second lieutenants, 2 warrant officers, 24 master sergeants, 104 staff sergeants, 10 mechanics, 35 technicians third class, 75 sergeants, 68 corporals, 78 technicians fifth class, and 34 privates second class. The above report does not include the air force stationed in China, that is, the thousands of air force personnel led by General Stratemeyer are not counted.</p>
<h3 id="e88">High Court Tries Two Cases of Traitors <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Case of Didingas Leibenson</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court, presided over by Presiding Judge Liu Yugui, opened investigative hearings for two cases. One was the case of Didingas Leibenson, a Lithuanian who was the owner of the Didingas cafe. He was reported for selling arms for the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War and for investigating whether civilians had wireless radios and secretly reporting to the enemy gendarmerie, so he was arrested by our regular bureau. Yesterday, Leibenson testified in court that he had been operating a car business in Shanghai from 1939 to 1942. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he was detained twice by the Japanese gendarmerie. The first time was in 1942, because his parents were both in the United States, he was accused of being a spy and detained for 40 days. The second time was in 1943, because he had US$10,000 in assets in Didingas, he was detained for 60 days. He denied selling arms for the Japanese gendarmerie, investigating wireless radios hidden by civilians, and reporting to the Japanese gendarmerie to detain the American Rosenbaum. He also claimed that the businesses he has operated in recent years have nothing to do with the Japanese gendarmerie, and there are witnesses who can be called to testify, so he was actually falsely accused. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody pending the summoning of witnesses for further questioning.</p>
<p>Ren Zhenchu Extorts Money Through Intimidation: The other defendant was Ren Zhenchu, director of the Yuanda Rice Store, from Shengxian County, Zhejiang Province, who lives in Zhujing. He was recently reported by the authorities for treason and extortion and was transferred to the High Prosecutor's Office for prosecution. The reason was that Ren had a teacher-student relationship with Hu Baosheng, an intelligence officer of the escaped Japanese gendarmerie in western Shanghai, and was familiar with the Japanese gendarme Takeda, so he took on the intelligence work for the team, possessing pistols and bullets. And in July of last year, he extorted 250,000 yuan in puppet currency from residents of the Jin family's residence, Shen Zhongmin, Shen Lianfu, and others. After the victory, due to strict searches, he sold the guns and ammunition and was arrested by Li Shaoshan, a patrol officer from the Zhenru branch of the police station, and transferred to the prosecutor's office. But Ren denied everything in court yesterday, except for admitting to selling guns and ammunition. He also claimed that the 250,000 yuan in puppet currency was borrowed from Shen Xiaomin and was not obtained through extortion. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Among those dozens of girls, she is the one I cannot forget!</p>
<p>A smiling face, a child-like figure that has not yet fully developed, round and large eyes with a black jade-like luster, and a delicate, eloquent mouth – that was Su Xiahe. – A third-year junior high school student. When I taught them Chinese, Su Xiahe sat in the first row. This fourteen-and-a-half-year-old girl had extraordinary talent and astonishing naughtiness. In class, if she listened attentively to your lectures, she would open her black jade-like eyes wide, concentrating as if nothing in the world could distract her; her comprehension and memory were stronger than any other classmate's, she understood what others did not understand early on, and she easily remembered things others could not remember clearly. If she happened to not like listening to the lecture, she would make funny faces to make the teacher laugh, her black eyes darting back and forth like a restless kitten.</p>
<p>I liked her extraordinarily, although I was helpless against her extraordinary mischievousness and naughtiness. In all honesty, among the forty-odd third-year junior high school students, she was, if not the best in terms of grades, at least the most gifted; if not the most beautiful, at least the most lovable. I am confident that my assessment is not at all excessive.</p>
<p>Once, during a break, I was pulled by them to sit and chat in the corridor filled with sunlight. Su Xiahe asked me:</p>
<p>"Teacher, why is Li Bai also called Li Taibai?"</p>
<p>Everyone else laughed.</p>
<p>I also smiled and asked her back: "Why are you called Su Xiahe?"</p>
<p>Her large, round black eyes flashed, her face broke into a smile, and she said with a giggle: "Daddy gave me the name, I don't know why."</p>
<p>"You are too unlike your name, lotus flowers are the most serene of all, you are like a wild rose, or a pair of little wildcats."</p>
<p>"Little wildcat doesn't sound very nice, if Teacher likes me to be called Rose, I'll change my name to Rose!" she said obediently.</p>
<p>"That's too much trouble," I couldn't help but laugh: "Changing names requires a great deal of effort, and you even have to report it to the Education Bureau!"</p>
<p>"Actually, Teacher, the lotus flower is the most worthy of pride and glory," she suddenly said in a serious tone, like a little adult: "Because it blooms the most beautiful and purest flower in the dirtiest swamp."</p>
<p>I nodded. What she said was right, but how could this be the speech of a fourteen-and-a-half-year-old child? So I felt a bit anxious for this precocious student, an inexplicable concern, which I gradually forgot afterwards.</p>
<p>I only worked at that school for half a year, and then I left. That half year of life gave me infinitely deep memories, and there was not a single memory in which I did not think of that child, that smiling face, with black jade-like eyes, the eloquent Su Xiahe!</p>
<p>Such a lovable child should be happy.</p>
<p>Who knew that one afternoon two months ago, she came to my place to see me, telling me that she was no longer studying, and had been out of school for half a year, because her father could not afford the tuition fees for too many children, so Xiahe finished junior high school and did not enter senior high school.</p>
<p>"However, if things stop going up so much in price, or if Daddy has a better income, I can still go to school next semester." Xiahe explained, with a hint of self-consolation; she was not at all depressed, still had a smiling face, still had a pair of black jade-like bright eyes, and was taller than before.</p>
<p>Before leaving, she left a small packet of candy wrapped in red and green transparent paper, smiling shyly: "This is for you, Auntie gave it to me and my younger brother yesterday, I divided it in half; now I'll divide half of that for you."</p>
<p>Before she finished speaking, she ran off.</p>
<p>I felt melancholy, melancholy, incomparably melancholy. Dusk passed, darkness invaded the room, I turned on the light, sat alone, pondered, and pondered again, eating the candy the child had left behind, wondering if it was sweet? Or bitter?…</p>
<p>Two months passed so quickly, and it was time for the term exams again. What followed was the payment of retention fees, the winter vacation, the payment of tuition fees, the purchase of books, and then a new semester began.</p>
<p>I thought of Xiahe, why hadn't she come again? I also thought of her schooling problem this semester. Prices two months later were not lower than they had been two months earlier. Now, I could only hope that her father would have a better income.</p>
<p>However, Xiahe remained silent and without news, and I did not have her address.</p>
<p>Until yesterday, I received a letter from another student, who told me this news: "Teacher, I think everyone who loves Xiahe will shed tears when they know, especially you, because you cherished her like a sister, how pitiful! Our little wildcat, little Rose, because of the pressure of life, because of the driving of the environment, she went to a restaurant to work as a hostess, the day before yesterday evening I went to find her, she was out, Xiahe's mother told me all this with tears in her eyes, and repeatedly told me not to tell others, it's embarrassing, people will laugh at her… Teacher, I know you won't laugh at her, so I'm telling you…"</p>
<p>I had no tears, not because I didn't love Xiahe, but because the emotions in my heart were even more indescribably painful than shedding tears. I read that letter over and over again, hoping that all these things were false, but unfortunately the student who wrote the letter was a very honest child.</p>
<p>No wonder Xiahe hadn't come again these days, she was afraid of being embarrassed, she was afraid that her teacher would laugh at her for being a hostess. Ah! Silly child, although you are clever, you are still young after all, is your teacher so insensible?</p>
<p>I hope to see her again, even if it's only once, I hope that when I see her again, she will still have that smiling face, still have those black jade-like bright eyes, and still be so innocent and genuine.</p>
<p>However, is this possible?</p>
<p>No one can answer this simple question, perhaps only heaven knows. I looked up, looking at the sky outside the window, the sky was bluer than ever before, without clouds, only a piece of incomparably glorious good sun; I then realized that I was sitting in the sunshine, so I thought of all the past events in the sunshine, that only half year of educational life, and that day in the corridor filled with sunlight, sitting with a large group of girls…</p>
<p>"Teacher, the lotus flower is the most worthy of pride and glory, because it blooms the most beautiful and purest flower in the dirtiest swamp." I thought of Xiahe's words. Admirable good child! You are a hundred times better than your inexperienced teacher, to be able to say such words, you must also understand the reason in the words, you will not forget how to survive in the swamp, and how to bloom the most beautiful and purest flower! I believe you will not fail your name, which is both proud and glorious!</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Techniques and Materials of Poetry Recitation <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Jiang</p>
<p>In recent years, poetry has been moving towards the path of recitation. We know that poetry recitation meetings have been held in Wuhan, Chongqing, and Shanghai... Recently, there was also a poetry recitation program in the first literary evening party of the Shanghai literary and art circles. However, on the whole, the results of recitation are not very good. The reasons for this can be divided into two aspects:</p>
<p>1.  The problem of recitation techniques; 2. The problem of recitation materials.</p>
<p>Many poets can only write with a pen, but are not good at chanting. Once they are asked to take the stage to recite, the results are naturally not impressive. Many poets cannot speak Mandarin. Once they start reciting, the southern accents and northern tones are mixed up, which is very easy to cause ridicule. I remember a poet reciting a poem about Gorky. The tone was very leisurely, but because it was Jiangbei Mandarin, the audience laughed at his Jiangbei accent instead of paying attention to the content he was reciting.</p>
<p>Poets are most likely to transcend reality. Poets who transcend reality do not have enough life experience, and often have no way to experience or grasp the complex emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness contained in the poetic meaning. This is another reason why recitation is not good. If a poet is a layman in drama and music, then it is difficult to ask him to be able to recite beautifully and movingly.</p>
<p>The above is about the problem of recitation techniques. To solve this problem, poets must work hard to practice their eloquence, learn Mandarin, participate in and experience real life, accept the techniques of drama, and deepen their musical cultivation.</p>
<p>A skilled woman cannot cook without rice, nor can a skilled woman cook rotten rice into fragrant rice. Even if poets have excellent recitation skills, it is in vain if they do not have suitable recitation materials.</p>
<p>Poets are often obsessed with the beauty of words and the peculiarity of forms, and are unwilling to read it aloud themselves, listen with their ears, or let the public read and listen. It is impossible to imagine that such poems will move the audience when they are recited. Poets are often the darlings of heaven, transcending as if they do not eat human fireworks. Their minds are filled with flowers, moons, beauties, wine... They capture the inspiration that flashes by like a wisp of smoke and write it into masterpieces. Such works are wonderful, but it is too difficult for them to be understood by audiences who rub against real life! Poets are even geniuses, who do not need to study or revise. They only need to let their inspiration gallop on paper along the tip of their pen, without paying attention to syllables or rhymes, and even arranging prose in a broken manner on paper! It is conceivable that it is difficult to ask such works to be recited and understood.</p>
<p>To achieve good results in poetry recitation, the following must be done:</p>
<p>1.  The poem recited must be able to represent the voice of the audience, so it is easy to be accepted and arouse resonance.</p>
<p>2.  The content of the poem recited must be closely related to the audience's life. They will not be interested in smoke-like inspiration.</p>
<p>3.  The language of the poem must be as close as possible to the audience's spoken language. The masses cannot enjoy profound and noble things!</p>
<p>4.  The structure of the poem is not too peculiar, the sentences are not too long, not Europeanized, and the words are not remote.</p>
<p>5.  Although it is not necessary to talk about level tones and antithetical couplets, at least the syllables should be smooth and the rhymes should be loud.</p>
<p>The above are the five lowest requirements for poetry recitation in terms of materials.</p>
<p>Poetry recitation is a kind of artistic performance. Poetry recitation is more monotonous and less easy to please than other artistic performances such as drama, film, singing, and dance. Therefore, to achieve good results in poetry recitation, it is necessary to cultivate and prepare a lot in both skills and materials!</p>

<h3 id="e101">A Joint Discussion on Coughing and Spitting Phlegm <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Murong Sui</p>
<p>"When about to ascend the hall, the voice must be raised." A sound of "Ahem" gives people a preparation in advance, which is etiquette. Coughing is in accordance with etiquette, which is why coughing must be learned. Coughing is close to the Dao! "Spitting without looking" is the righteous anger of those filled with indignation. Spitting phlegm is in accordance with nurturing, which is why spitting phlegm must be learned. Phlegm is close to the Dao!</p>
<p>"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao." Understanding it spiritually depends on the person!</p>
<p>The teacher stands on the podium to teach; the students are dozing off in the lecture hall! "Is my Dao exhausted?" Not yet. A sound of "Ahem" startles the student, and then he listens as if it were the first time. Thus, "The master skillfully and patiently leads people."</p>
<p>"Yao offered the world to Xu You, but Xu You did not accept it." He painstakingly ran to the river to wash his ears. Isn't that stupid? If Xu You had spat out a mouthful of thick phlegm, it would have been a "first rank!" Wouldn't that be "resolute and decisive!" "Vivid and colorful!" When we read history to this point, we cannot help but "smash our spittle pot."</p>
<p>Living in today's world, without changing the ancient Dao, understanding it spiritually depends even more on the person!</p>
<p>For example, in a debate arena: you must say a few words. After standing up proudly: "Brothers, brothers… today, today…". If you still can't think of what to say, then you have to "Ahem," "Ahem," and then "Ahem" again… People will sympathize with you: "Are you not feeling well today?" Also, if what people say doesn't suit you, you can also "Ahem," "Ahem," and keep "Ahem"-ing. Its effect can at least distract people.</p>
<p>As for "spitting," it has even more unexpected effects. It can make people look back and walk away. If you say you oppose them, it was unintentional. If you say you sympathize with them, you have already "spit without looking." If you have tuberculosis, you can also subtly spread the bacteria and put the other party to death. It is more effective than spreading rumors. Isn't that wonderful!</p>
<p>Wonderful, wonderful! Wonderful to the extreme, an accidental masterpiece. This is what is called "coughing and spitting pearls!"</p>

<p>"People are disliking you! Wouldn't it be better to say a few less words?"</p>
<p>"These are the words I want to say, this is the song I want to sing! How can I not speak because people dislike me?..."</p>
<p>"Then, wouldn't it be better to change your voice?"</p>
<p>"Friend, I dare to bet! You must have mistaken me—I am a crow of solid black, not a parrot with green feathers and a red beak!"</p>
<h3 id="e103">A Couple Soaring Together <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Before Old Master Mo came back, Bao Ling certainly called Madam Weng the Second "Daddy." At that time, the child also thought that maybe that was Madam Weng the Second's name, because the child did not yet quite understand the meaning of the two words "Daddy." Later, when Old Master Mo came back, Bao Ling did not know for a long time what to call him. It was still Mo Sheng who once told the child, and also explained the meaning of "Daddy" to the child. Only then did the child have a sudden realization, and so, from then on, the child no longer called Madam Weng the Second "Daddy." Because of this, the child's small head had suffered several slaps from Madam Mo. In the child's heart, the child naturally did not accept this, but the child did not dare to make a "humph" sound with the child's mouth. Based on the child's experience of the past year, "Mommy" was much more fierce than "Daddy." The child also gradually understood now why "Mommy" was more fierce than "Daddy," and why "Daddy" was so afraid of "Mommy." All of this was because Mo Sheng had told the child when Mo Sheng was free. However, the child felt that "Mommy" certainly had reason, but it was also not necessary to excessively hit a "drenched chicken." Therefore, the child was still very sympathetic towards "Daddy."</p>
<p>At this moment, Bao Ling was reading, reading, and suddenly noticed that Old Master Mo was sitting to the side, completely lost in thought. And so, the child could not help but stand up, and walk to the front of Old Master Mo, and say:</p>
<p>"Daddy, I've memorized it!"</p>
<p>"Ah?... Oh, good, good! Good child!"</p>
<p>Bao Ling's words startled Old Master Mo. Soon after, the child was awakened from his contemplative state. Once again, the child seemed to have fallen into the dreamscape of the previous night, and also felt that that string of past events was actually somewhat similar to the scene in the dream of the previous night. The child felt this was somewhat strange, but, because the child had to look after Bao Ling's lessons, the child did not temporarily have the mood to understand this in detail. And so, the child forced himself to appear calm, and turned his face toward Bao Ling, to ask:</p>
<p>"Then, you recite it for me to hear."</p>
<p>Bao Ling obediently turned around, and recited in a clear voice:</p>
<p>"At the beginning of man, nature is good; natures are similar, habits are far apart!"</p>
<p>Bao Ling had just recited the beginning, when suddenly Mo Sheng rushed in in a fluster.</p>
<p>"Master! Master! Madam is about to give birth! Madam is about to give birth!" Mo Sheng shouted, both surprised and delighted.</p>
<p>Old Master Mo was startled yet again. He suddenly stood up.</p>
<p>"Quickly go and invite Madam Weng the Second to come, and also, tell Madam Weng the Second to bring a midwife."</p>
<p>"Madam Weng the Second already came long ago, and the midwife just arrived! Right now they are very busy!" After saying that, Mo Sheng hurriedly left.</p>
<p>Only then did Old Master Mo let the child's heart drop. The child paced a few steps inside the room, and said excitedly to Bao Ling:</p>
<p>"Bao Ling, you will soon have a younger brother! Oh, do you still prefer a younger sister?"</p>
<p>After Old Master Mo raised this question, even the child himself felt at a loss. The child thought: "I hope to have another son, after all! Or do I want a daughter?"</p>
<p>"I prefer a younger sister, I don't like a younger brother." Bao Ling thought for a moment, and answered Old Master Mo.</p>
<p>"Correct! It would be best to give you another younger sister!" Old Master Mo said, and patted Bao Ling's head.</p>
<p>At this moment, Old Master Mo was very happy in his heart. The child no longer remembered what the child's mood had been when Bao Ling had initially been born.</p>

<p>There are currently two acts of righteousness in Shanghai that urgently call upon people from all walks of life to contribute money and effort, the more the better! I said yesterday that the Shanghai Municipal Education Loan Committee will rescue 10,000 impoverished students from dropping out of school, and needs 100 million yuan to complete this righteous act of rescue. The winter vacation of each school is approaching, and the procedures for applying for registration will soon begin. In the blink of an eye, the spring semester will begin. May I ask, dear readers, can you bear to let these lovely young people drop out of school one morning? Dropping out of school for young people is not a loss for one person or one family, but a great loss for the country and society. If those who are well-fed and well-clothed pool a little money to take on the responsibility of teaching and relief, this very meaningful work of helping students will not be difficult to accomplish and will be of immeasurable merit.</p>
<p>Winter relief, now is the time! This newspaper collects donations on behalf, but the donations have not been enthusiastic, which is deeply regrettable! The ancients "sent charcoal in the snow," which has been passed down as a good story for thousands of years. I hope that enthusiastic people will see righteousness and act bravely, and enthusiastically contribute to ensure that this relief cause will not be abandoned halfway. The association currently has seven shelters, housing a total of 3,000 displaced people and orphans, providing them with food, clothing, education, and a peaceful life; street beggars, petty thieves, pickpockets, and hooligans were originally the most unbearable pranks in Shanghai. Now the authorities have taken them all in, which is indeed a commendable good governance in the ten-mile foreign settlement. To be honest, citizens should donate more to replenish the foundation and ensure that these people are educated when they are young and cared for when they are old, which is indeed a sacred obligation of Shanghai society.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Speaking of Returning Home, Tears Fall, Internal Migration is Righteous, and the Heart is Like an Arrow <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: I was very moved to read the section of your newspaper's special correspondent Mr. Zhang Jun's report on the return of righteous people to their hometowns. I respectfully report my personal experience to you: I was recruited by the Central Machinery Factory in Shanghai in July of the 28th year of the Republic of China. There were leaders along the way, and people were greeted everywhere after passing through Hong Kong's defenses. My family was also sent by the factory in the 29th year. This was the good intention of the factory. In Kunming for six years, I was promoted to foreman by the factory, so I am very grateful to the factory. But in my distant hometown, there are still elderly parents around seventy years old. They spent eight years of slave life in the "ruins where the houses were burned to the ground by the enemy for clearing the countryside." In this difficult living environment, I had two children, plus my sins. The happiest thing is the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and the reunion with the hometown I abandoned for eight years and the scattered parents and brothers. This is my only hope. It is also the only hope of us righteous people. Who knows that the flames of civil war will follow the cheers of victory, and traffic is blocked everywhere. Now, although the civil war has stopped, the national industry has plummeted, and the sad voices of layoffs and unemployment have spread everywhere. But the good news of relief and repatriation of righteous people to their hometowns has been spread all over the land by the radio of various agencies and newspapers. People in society are tired of hearing and seeing this, and only these unemployed righteous people have no way to return and no way to seek help. I hope that God will use the power of salvation to bring the opportunity of "relief and repatriation" to every unemployed righteous person. Who knows that God and the God of Wealth deliberately make trouble, they want to do the business of transporting US dollars, gold, and speculative commodities. It is impossible for the poor and unemployed righteous people to ask for the opportunity to return home. Now various hometown associations and labor associations have jointly organized the Righteous People's Homegoing Association, and I think this is the most reliable opportunity. I immediately registered with the hometown association, and it is said that there is a hope of free travel in the future, or according to the asking price of more than 10,000 yuan. I immediately went through the procedures for leaving the factory, and received the factory's severance pay and 50,000 yuan of transportation subsidies. I waited for more than ten days for the Righteous People's Homegoing Car, but there was no definite message. It is said that there are more than 100,000 righteous people in Kunming, and there are more than 3,000 righteous people registered in this period. There are only ten vehicles for repatriation, and at most only 300 people can be repatriated every day. According to this, how many years and months will it take for more than 100,000 righteous people to return to their hometowns. Today, I am borrowing a corner of your newspaper with tears to appeal to you, when will we righteous people be able to return home by car and boat? It's really killing people!

<p>Mr. Editor: In Shanghai after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, although everything has progressed, the past privileges of imperialism in China and the attitude of disregarding our country's laws have not been eradicated. The writer watched a play at the Dumei Cinema yesterday. The general foreigners in the theater not only did not comply with the police station's regulations, but the smoke filled the entire theater. Even when the party and national anthem and the chairman's portrait were played, they talked and laughed freely and did not stand up (it is said that the theater sometimes does not even screen programs such as singing the party anthem). This move is really inappropriate. Please publish it in your column to promote the attention of the relevant authorities and the general public. (A reader of this newspaper)</p>

<p>To the Editor: Having read the article "A Young Widow Appeals for Justice for Her Husband" published in your newspaper on the 13th of this month, it clearly does not accord with the facts. This branch bureau is located in western Shanghai, and during the Anti-Japanese War, it relied on the power of the enemy and puppet regime, and has long been a den of crime, known as "bad soil." After the victory and the restoration of the country, these habitual criminals still secretly set up "scalper stalls" and gambled as before. In order to maintain public order, the police bureau has issued repeated orders to prohibit smoking and gambling, supervising its subordinates to strictly enforce the law, and must eradicate it thoroughly.</p>
<p>Xu Xianzong, a detective in the criminal investigation section of this branch bureau, has been serving in the police bureau since the victory, and has been quite competent in his official duties. On the 25th of last December, this branch bureau received a report that there were gangsters gambling in the Wujiaochang area of Caojiadu in western Shanghai (commonly known as "scalper stalls"). It immediately sent the officer to lead plainclothes police officers disguised to go to the address to break the case, arrested 18 gamblers and prepared to escort them to the bureau. Unexpectedly, when they were being escorted onto the police car, the gambling thug Qian A-si (namely Qian Aichu) suddenly resisted and escaped. Officer Xu, being responsible for his duty, chased after him relentlessly. When he chased him to Yuanfang Lane, he caught the criminal. Unexpectedly, the criminal turned around to resist arrest, seized the gun and fought, and was shot. He was then sent to the hospital by the accompanying police officers, but the treatment was ineffective. Officer Xu had his back of his hand scratched in many places due to the fight over the gun, and the blood would not stop. Moreover, the body of the deceased was examined by the prosecutor and the forensic doctor, and it was confirmed that the bullet entered from outside the right shoulder and entered the subcutaneous tissue of the left waist. This sufficiently proves that he was shot due to the mutual twisting to seize the gun. Furthermore, Qian A-si is a well-known local bully in western Shanghai. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, he opened a Dang Sheng gambling house in western Shanghai. Later, he was in charge of the Hollywood gambling table, and he also set up a dragon gate stall in the Dashen Hua-Min gambling tables in Nanshi as a favorite disciple of Zhu Ni Shunlin. He has more than three previous convictions on record.</p>
<p>The above is the situation at the time. I hope that people in the community will uphold justice for the police officers who are dutifully searching and arresting smokers and gamblers. Otherwise, police officers in general will be discouraged. The report "A Young Widow Appeals for Justice for Her Husband" is entirely fabricated and not factual. In addition to the gambling case along with the remaining 17 criminals that have been sent to the local inspection office for legal proceedings, this letter is specially requested to be corrected, so as not to confuse the hearing. Sincerely, The Ninglu Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau January 16, 35th year.</p>
