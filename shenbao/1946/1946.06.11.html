<h3 id="c1">馬歇爾周恩來密談　共軍停攻前小組難復會　延安新要求內容共三點 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕馬歇爾特使十日上午十時在寗海路官邸接見周恩來，計密談二小時半，馬使於獲悉由周恩來帶來之延安新方案後，擬於下午往謁蔣主席，轉達中共之意見。據今晚某權威人士透露，就目前局勢觀察，在停戰公告發佈以前，政府與中共雙方表示之基本態度，原有甚長之距離，嗣經馬使不斷斡旋，始獲得停戰十五日之臨時協議，幸見一綫和平曙光，詎意政府停</p>
<p>戰公告發出之後，關內外之共軍竟故態復萌，發動有計劃之攻勢，到處襲擊國軍，如此一面嚷和，一面喊打之欺騙行為，出之於共軍，本無足異，然已因此加深政府及民眾乃至盟國友人對於中共之警惕。微聞今日上午馬周談話之結果，對軍事三人會之需否立刻舉行，雖已交換意見，但在目前關內外各地共軍尚未切實遵令停戰以前，此一會議之前途，亦殊難預求。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕據聞周恩來此次由延安帶回之新方案，其內容雖未公開發表，但已以某種方式暗示其要點於新聞記者其擬提出於軍事三人小組會者，大意為（一）停戰之詳細辦法，將涉及停運軍隊接收哈爾濱及民主政權之處理辦法等問題。（二）全面恢復交通，將涉及如何拆除碉堡及解除封鎖綫等問題。（三）整軍方案，將商討如何實施之附件及派執行小組赴各地。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十日電〕交通部長俞大維，今日訪馬使總部，討論恢復交通事，總部發言人稱：自周氏返京後，馬使尚未與蔣主席約定再度晤談，而周氏此來所携者或為中共對永久停戰之「最後代價」。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕民主同盟政協代表羅隆基，章伯鈞，黃炎培，沈鈞儒於昨晚今晨分別搭國赴滬，民盟代表現留京者，僅梁潄溟一人，據悉，渠等將於十五日返京。又青年黨中黨委李　，劉東岩，定十一日赴滬，聞該党與民主同盟代表，擬於十五日前後，聯合發表對時局意見。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十日電〕改訂財政收支系統會議，十日下午宣告閉幕，自上午起至閉幕前一刻正，各與會者對提案無不作最熱烈之爭辯討論，中心乃在「財政部提調整三十五年下半年度各省（市）縣（市）財政收支預算」一案，其中關於帶征地方公糧，不得超過賦額三成，認為事實上不無困難，在兼顧地方民力原則下，在征借中與財糧兩部洽商撥補三成。又對於卅五年下半年度收支不能平衡者，亦定有各種辦法：（一）依照修訂財政收支系統原則之規定，由各省市編具收支對照表，報請中央核撥補助費。（二）職員待遇經費，應在實物售價溢收項下統籌。（三）各邊遠省份及未恢復區域，除照上列二項辦法辦理外，所需事業費，應請中央特予補助撥借，併應專案辦理，未照審查意見通過。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕才糧兩部召開之實施改訂財政收支系統會議，十日下午四時舉行閉幕禮，到俞鴻鈞·徐堪及來賓會員二百餘人，由徐堪主持開會并致開幕詞，對會議能順利進行，向各會員表示感謝，併提出嚴禁苛擾，力除弊端，中央與地方通力合作等意見，五時禮成。又上午十時至十二時，下午三時至四時均舉行大會，由俞鴻鈞主席，通過第一組對省縣機構緊縮之建議意見三項，三時散會。</p>
<p>陳立夫氏警惕演詞</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕財糧會議閉幕式中，中央組織部長陳立夫，曾有一警惕性之演辭，據稱：此次會議為一專門研究財政收支系統之會議，但結果卻不能受令人滿意，內因僅不過為一技術上之改變，而非根本辦法，與國父遺教之目的，亦相距甚遠，且吾國係一農業國家，而今之金融政策，則竟與此佔有百分之八十五之農民不生關係，置大多數人民於飢饉線上。吾人應知中國目前所需要者，金融應有澈底的政策，經濟要有積極的辦法，如一切政策辦法祇利於少數商人，置工厰倒閉，農村破產於不顧，殊非所宜。革命乃在培植地方自治，但目前則為下面的，均一起被抓到上面去，形成人財兩空，離開目的太遠，故形成經濟則捨本一逐末，政治則頭重腳輕，若干不應有之現象，陳氏演說畢，全場國報以熱烈掌聲。</p>

<p>〔中央社廣州十日電〕香港華僑日報於日軍佔領時期，附敵繼續營業，抨擊盟國，最近廣州行營以該報附敵有據，經調查確　，將該報社長岺維休列入漢奸名單，香港國民日報特於七日著論聲計岺逆罪狀，并請全體港僑注意岺逆行動，及華僑報財產之轉移，毋使漏網，以伸國法。詎港政府於八日下午令停止國民日報發行一月，中山日報并以「我們抗議我們控訴」為題，認此乃港政府不友好之行動，社論中特別指出「香港政府對於附敵份子是有逮捕和引渡的義務，對於岺維休不特未加逮捕，反而壓迫指摘岺維休代表中國人民公意的報紙，無論香港政府的實際意向為如何，中國人民不能不認為遺憾。香港政府此舉，顯然有袒護岺逆并為之張目之嫌。因此我們不能不向香港政府抗議，不能不向全世界愛好正義的人士控拆。同時并指出國民日報是中央宣傳部所主辦，這是港政府當局所明知的，今港府竟對中國政府在港所設立的代　機關，作此嚴厲的處置，殊表遺憾。社論最後稱目前正有不少中國人，鍳於港政府不　根據我政府的通緝名單，而自動地命令華僑日報立刻停刊的事實，懷疑香港當局未必真有誠意去嚴格發行那個業經訂定的合作辦法。」又本市新聞界對此事件深為注意，擬採取一致行動作嚴正之表示。</p>

<p>全國靑年軍已於五月期滿復員，均將於本月內輸送回籍，其在東南區者，分海洋總隊及長江總隊，集中上海南京，然後遣散。第一批二千餘人，昨日抵滬，本埠各界並於今晨舉行慰勞大會。</p>
<p>溯靑年軍之發動，在民國卅三年春夏之交。當時日寇發動湘柱戰事，獨山失守，貴陽吿急，抗戰局勢，最爲緊張。最高統帥乃以「十萬靑年十萬軍」爲號召，發動知識靑年從軍運動。全國各地有志靑年，莫不聞風興起，紛紛投筆從戎，分別在重慶，綦江，瀘州，萬縣，貴陽，西安，昆明，贛州，永安等地，入伍服役，編成九個靑年師；並奉命於最短期內編訓完畢，俾得隨時開往前錢，參加民族解放的聖戰。迨去年秋初，敵寇屈膝投降，抗戰勝利結束，靑年志士雖未及効命於疆塲，但其，所負的任務，可謂業已完成。軍事當局乃將以戰鬥爲目的之敎育，改爲軍官預備的敎育，預定至本年五月期滿復員，使此十萬靑年，欲求學者復學，欲就業者就業，欲繼續從軍者從軍，各遂其志，各得其所。我們對於這十萬靑年解甲歸來，表示萬分的敬意。茲乘東南區靑年軍首批二千人來滬之際，略書所感，與吾全國有志靑年共勉。</p>
<p>第一，諸君於抗戰形勢最危急之秋，參加革命行列，成爲抗戰的勁旅，而尤其東南區域，多半淪陷，靑年不畏艱險，投筆從戎，難能可貴，宜無待言。今番雖以任務終了，解甲復員，各回本位，當能一本初衷，救國愛民，成爲建國的幹部。諸君須知建國的艱難，將十百倍於抗戰。眼看勝利十個月，國內現象，粉紛擾擾，就可知此言之不誣。我們至今還沒有踏上建國的正軌，其原因固不一而足，但是最重要的，還在社會凌亂，人心浮囂，更加談不到紀律兩字。在這種紊亂，嘈雜，齷齪，虛浮的社會環境中，復興建國，從何說起？所幸諸君，均受過嚴格的軍事訓練，度過一年又半的軍旅生活，早已養成重秩序，守紀律，且能自治，自動，自立，自强，互助，合作的優良習慣，回到社會之後，仍能珍重這種最可寳貴的習慣，吃苦耐勞，爲民衆的表率，則今日社會不良的風氣必由諸君而轉移，使每一個人民都能像諸君一樣。古人所謂「士不可以不弘毅，任重而道遠」，差不多就是爲諸君道的。諸君方在靑年，志行純潔，而血氣方剛，在這種繁華浮囂的大都市裏，尤應提高警覺，隨時隨地注意潛伏着的陷阱，稍一不愼，就有失足之慮。諸君不是聽得人家說過「社會是一個大熔爐」的話嗎？諸君必須立志做一塊不怕火的眞金，决不爲環境所同化，否則隨波逐流，還能說什麼改造社會？我們敬祝諸君，憑以前所得寳貴的訓練，身體力行，與環境奮鬥，創造一個新天地，這纔是「英雄造時勢」。唯有如此，諸君始可蔚爲建國的幹部。</p>
<p>第二，人人都知道創業之不易，尤其是復興建國的偉業。我國經過八年艱苦抗戰，創鉅痛深，環顧全國，瘡痍滿目，我們都覺得建國前途，有千斤重擔待我們去挑。何况物質條件遠不如人，人家已到了原子能硏究的時代，而我們還落後在乎工業的窠臼裏，欲言建國，不能不「迎頭趕上」。在此迎頭趕上的過程中，我們所將遭遇到的一切困難與障礙，不知凡幾，正需要我們用毅力勇氣去克服。蔣主席於本月三日向諸君訓話，亦以保持「刻苦耐勞」的德性相勗勉。軍隊效命於疆場，固然是「一寸江山一滴血」，但在建國事業上，也是如此，眞所謂「一分精神，一分事業」。我們曾看到大戰前的蘇聯，號召人民，節衣縮食，建設社會主義的國家，五年計劃卒於三年內完成；而現在我們又看到戰後的蘇聯，又要求人民束緊肚帶，努力於工業復員了。我們是一切落後的國家，更需要我們鞠躬盡瘁。好在諸君已將身體鍛鍊得像銅筋鐵骨一般的了，任何重擔，不怕承挑，任何苦惱，準備忍受。有些淺見的人，妄想戰後即可過安逸享福的白子，而諸君則少年立志，决不當沉湎自誤。我們更相信諸君不但不致鬆懈諸君的工作，而且必加倍勞力，以完成諸君未來更大的使命。</p>
<p>全國十萬靑年軍已經開始復員了，不久均將求學的求學，就業的就業了！昔爲抗戰的勁旅，今爲建國的幹部。任重追遠，願諸君共勉之！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：英總參長蒙哥馬利今日飛抵埃及。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕蒙哥馬利元帥已於今晨離比飛往埃及，將在該處舉行重要會議，商討中東之防務戰略問題，以適應航空及原子炸彈時代之需要，策劃保護帝國地產之防務計劃。今在埃及之急迫問題，為英軍倘履行退出埃及之諾約後，英國將作何舉措。</p>
<p>修約談判　爭執焦點</p>
<p>據可靠外交界方面消息：目前英埃修約談判之難點有二：即（一）英國應允軍隊退出埃及，但要求保留在蘇彝士運河區之陸空軍根據地，藉以保護其通往印度之帝國重要生命聯絡綫。（二）英國要求在條約中增加一條款，許英軍在緊急時有關還埃及之權。埃及人士認為有此規定，則英國可隨時借此「緊急」之理由重建而埃及，現悉英國之計劃，將在外約但建立根據地，在東非亦有返立根據地之可能。</p>
<p>各方推測　訪埃目的</p>
<p>〔路透社開羅九日電〕此間專家相信蒙哥馬利至中東訪問之主要目的，為研究英國決定退出埃及後之軍事糾紛問題。若干專家則相信，萬一發生直接影響中東之戰爭，英將準備廢棄蘇彞士運河之價值。蓋最近之戰爭，已證明地中海為一俘虜海，且就新戰術而論，蘇彞士運河極易使之無法運用，故以為英國今後之新戰略，將注意於好望角之航行，及飛機之飛越非洲。在第二次世界大戰期間，已有此傾向。此間英語「埃及日報」載稱，蒙哥馬利此行，必將討論防務新根據地，及對中東之防務計劃，一　將夜夜將東非關為英國新根據，以代替埃及之建議。據悉，蒙哥馬利將於明後日飛抵開羅。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社德黑蘭九日電〕據可靠消息：伊朗中央政府與亞塞爾拜然省自治政府進行談判，原有成功之望，此際又將發生困難，緣內閣總理沙丹納表示願接受該省政府所提各項要求之後，該省代表得寸進尺，又復提出新要求，其最重要者，厥為沙丹納內閣須於協定正式成立之前實行改組，其所持理由乃反對派各閣員一日不去職，一日既能設法阻止協定之設施，一切問題亦即無法予以解決。但以事實而論，內閣改組必將遭遇重大困難，依照伊朗國傳統習慣，內閣總理不能要求閣員辭職，此乃議會特權故也。據接近內閣人士談稱：外傳談判業已決裂，並非事實，德黑蘭與大不列士之間，函件往還仍極頻繁。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦九日電〕英國外相貝文對目前的世界大局，感覺到非常失望，將於本星期再回到巴黎，據說是要作「一次最後的努力」，使蘇聯能為世界和平而共同合作．大約在三十六年以前吧，貝文會放棄了汽車夫的工作而去組織碼頭工人工會，想為碼頭工人們「作一點事情」，現在貝文已屆交已屆六十五歲的高齡了，一部份人把他列作英國最偉大的外相之一，他仍在本着以往的精神，想要「作一點事情」，這次是為了在世界各處受苦甚或時常挨餓的小百姓們。</p>
<p>貝文對未來在巴黎舉行的四國外長會議，并不表示樂觀，但是據接近貝文的人說，「四國外長會議的成敗，實在關係太大了，貝文必須再作一次努力」。貝文對於蘇聯態度的強硬雖非常失望，但并不覺得驚奇，他就任外相雖只有七個月，但對於外交卻非門外漢。他曾在邱吉爾的戰時內閣中任職六年，每逢英國主要的對外政策有所決定時，他都親身參加，據英國外交部中人說，當時的英外相艾登，和貝文時常是形影不離的。</p>
<p>工黨內閣組成後，仍繼續着以往的英國對外政策，一九四五年工黨競選的時候，曾興高采烈地宣稱：工黨秉政之後，英國與蘇聯的關係可以更為密切。可是年現在的情形，莫斯科方面的表示並未見得親切，所謂與蘇聯關係更趨密切一層，也還是大成問題，然而貝文或許不這　想，因為如果他認為與蘇聯不能合作，那他大可以默不表示意見了。傳聞蘇聯外長莫洛托夫并不歡喜貝文，可是對他卻很敬重。</p>
<p>貝文對他工作的艱鉅，了解得非常清楚，但他卻一些不表示退縮。上次他赴巴黎的時候，臨行曾在內閣會議上說：如果和平有任何破裂我決通知你們。</p>
<p>貝文說話喜歡單刀直入，與蘇代表爭執起來，一句也不肯示弱，然并未因此失去他那有耐性和愉快的風度。</p>
<p>上次巴黎四國外長會議的時候，他時常很呆板的坐在安樂椅上，一點表情都沒有。他願意讓美國國務卿貝爾納斯的意見是完全一致的。據他的隨員說，會議時如有什麼花樣，他可以立刻看出來在這花樣的背後是包含着何種意義。</p>
<p>貝文一向對共產黨抱懷疑的態度，並非自今日開始，但這種態度並未他屢次同蘇聯交涉而有所減少。貝文相信使用詐術絕不會得到成功，同時也不計較個人間的宿嫌。</p>
<p>二月一日，他在倫敦聯合國機構安全理事會開會時致詞稱：世界各平所以遭受威脅，是因為莫斯科不斷的宣傳攻擊英國，并利用各國的共產黨以作攻擊英國人民和英國政府的工具。第二天保守黨辦的每日郵報即著論說，貝文的演詞是一個強國的發言人向另一強國所發出的　坦白的挑戰性聲明。可是在他這樣正言厲色，指斥共產主義後的一小　，卻又和他的勁敵蘇聯代表維辛斯基「為工人乾杯」了。</p>
<p>五月廿七日，剛巧巴黎外長會議休會之後，貝文曾打電報給莫洛托夫，要求他在蘇聯與西方列強發生交涉的時候能「忍耐，寬容和諒解」。他就是抱着這樣的希望而回到巴黎。</p>
<p>貝文在英帝國政策，撤退駐印度埃及的英軍，及將英國代管土地交聯合國代管等問題上雖有人意見和他不同，可是他對蘇立場的堅定，卻已獲得了保守黨和工黨雙方的支持。</p>

<p>從上表中我們可以得到兩點引論：一是在民國二十一年上海患霍亂的曾達四千餘人之多，而今年的客觀環境，本報先已指出過，由於大戰之後，人口集中，房荒，貧窮，無知等種種因素，霍亂的猖獗有着更大的可能性，現在全上海的時疫病床一共不到一千張，如果對於霍亂菌不積極的加以預防和撲滅，前途實不堪設想。第二，民國二十一年上海患時疫的雖然這樣多，但死亡的人數都比較少，平均每一百個患者裏面，喪失生命的不過七人，較之南京的每百人死二十三人，北平的每百人死七十九人，情形要好得多。這究竟是什麼原因呢？可以說：主要的是由於上海注射防疫針的人數較多的緣故。</p>
<p>注射疫苗可以產生兩點顯著的效果：一是注射以後，患此症的機會可以減少到百分之十，換句話說，如果本來你有十足的機會要患霍亂，注射以後，就祗剩一成的可能了。其次，萬一不幸你於注射後依舊染了疫症，那末你死亡的可能性還是較未注射過的人低得多，據估計，後者的死亡率大槪要高出二十五倍，防疫注射的效果可以從民國十九年至二十二年上海市的統計數字中看出來：</p>
<p>注射人數　患者人數　死亡人數　死亡率</p>
<p>十九年　五三七、〇三四　一二八　一六　一二、五</p>
<p>二十年　七六一、二七九　四八二　五七　一一、八</p>
<p>二十一年　一、〇六二、六〇九　四、二六〇　三一七　七、四</p>
<p>二十二年　九四〇、六〇〇　無　無</p>
<p>上表中歷年患者人數由於其他因素，並無比較價值，可注意的是死亡率隨着注射人數的增加每年都降低。</p>

<p>不過，仔細說起來，注射防疫針當然決不能給你以絕對的保障，最緊要的還是在於本身的體格堅強以及注重衛生，以使霍亂菌根本沒有乘虛而入的機會。記者不憚老生常談，在這裏再提出幾點日常生活中應該注意之點：（一）飲水務必要煮沸，街頭冷飲切不可吃。（二）蒼蠅要盡量撲滅，根本的要清除它滋生的環境，門窗最好裝紗，至少食物器皿要用紗罩。（三）菜蔬要洗滌乾凈，並須煮透，生菓要去皮再吃。（四）儘量注意個人衛生，遠離病人，病人用的碗蓋溺器衣服在未消毒前，切不可接觸。</p>
<p>最後，我更要大聲疾呼：霍亂的蔓延已經到了非常嚴重的關頭，行政當局與衛生當局要趕快積極行動，合理的解決房荒，澈底的改善衛生環境，使霍亂菌根本沒有滋長的地盤。這樣，配合着廣大的防疫注射和全體市民的自我警惕，來共同合作，撲滅這時時刻刻威脅着每一個人生命的疫虎。（文中）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕國立北京大學上海同學會，頃定本月十六日下午二時，假本市新問路小沙渡路口新閘路小學，開會追悼已故同學蘇甲榮。蘇氏號演存，廣西藤縣人，民九畢業於國立北京大學文科哲學系，少有至性，志切救國。在學時，常為各報撰論文議事，喚醒民族工作。五四運動，尤爲盡力。精與地之學，首先創製「中國地理沿革圖」，上自禹貢，下及民國，舉凡歷代疆域之變遷，國勢之興，瞭如指掌，復依　國父建國方略，製「孫中山先生實業計劃書」，如築港治河建　　路等計劃，無不詳載，以供國人參考。又製「各國在華交通侵略圍」，警塲國人之發價，以　自强。迨一一八以後、即專製各種抗日地圖，如「日本侵擾我東北地圖」，「暴日侵擾之熱河河北國」，「日軍侵擾　河圖」，「暴日侵犯我江南地圖」，「日軍侵滬國」，「中日兩國形勢圖」，「百萬分之一的東三省地圖」等，無不使國人觸目驚心，同仇敵愾。後政府西移，蘇氏以爲從事於文化敎育，一時未能撤離上海，淪陷後，仍蟄居不動，雖明知處於敵人淫威之下，猶日夕工作，供給國人以東省不變色地圖，如「中華民國全圖」，「遠東大地圖」，「太平洋圖」等鉅製，常暗示敵軍動向，使國人知所警惕。因此遭敵憲兵部之忌，指圖中不列滿洲國，以爲大逆，於卅三年七月十一日被捕，所有製成各種地圖，悉數捆載而去，在押十日，備受敲扑灌水諸刑。蘇氏體素瘦弱，經此打擊，遂成內傷，百計求治，終不獲效。勝利後，爲生活計，仍力疾著述，而病益加深，延至卅四年十二月二十八日病歿，家無餘蓄，身後蕭條。並悉該校同學張　夫，於接收東北時遇害，於追悼蘇氏之日，並設位致祭，合祀雙忠云。</p>

<p>歡迎投稿　小學課程研究座（二）　小學一年級生應免授算術</p>
<p>對於小學課程方面，這可算是一個實騐報吿，這也可算是一個臨時建議：</p>
<p>我的第三個兒子鈴鈴，今年六歲，二月間，入小學一年上唸書。他是一個聰明的孩子，讀了三個多月書，國語已經說得像樣，鉛筆小字能寫得和練習薄的方格子一樣大小，淸淸楚楚地，成績倒還不差，只是筆算比較幼稚。一個月以前的一天，鈴鈴很沮喪地吿訴我：「今天，先生說我不會做算術，駡我不好」。我問他做什麽算術，他就用鉛筆寫出一個算式：2+（）=5，說：「先生叫我在這括弧裏寫出一個數字來，我不懂，寫不出來，先生就駡我不好」。我常時在孩子面前，不便批評先生，便對鈴鈴說：「你在括弧裏面寫上一個3字就好了，2加3就是5」。鈴鈴拍拍手說：「對的對的」！一種天眞爛漫完全沒有虛假的神情，使我感覺到敎學者殘忍，爲什麼駡他不好，使他沮喪。</p>
<p>在最近短短的一個月中間，鈴鈴從加法學到减法了。前三天，鈴鈴又很沮喪地向我申訴：「今天，我做不出算術，先生駡我眞笨—！我問鈴鈴，做的是什麼算術？鈴鈴說：「先生說是减法：哥哥踢毽子4個，减弟弟踢毽子2個，是哥哥多踢鍵子幾個？先生問我，我答不出，先生就駡我眞」。我安慰鈴鈴說：「你不眞笨，而且你不笨。這樣難做的减法，像你這樣年幼的孩子，當然不會做的」。鈴鈴驚異地問：「那末先生爲什麽駡我眞笨」？我回答他說：「因爲光生比你聽明」！這一個回答，小孩子那能理會？我爲了一時氣憤，是在議刺先生了。年幼的孩子，不是萬能的，做先生的應該顧到他的智力，好好敎導他，不應該開口駡他不好，閉口駡他眞笨，使弱小的心靈時時遭受到不應該打擊的打擊。老實說，這是先生的不好，先生的眞笨。</p>
<p>因此我聯想到這不僅僅是先生的不好，眞笨，而是編訂小學課程標準者的不好，眞笨。先生敎加法，敎减法，全是依據國定課本的，而國定課本是遵照小學課程標準編制的，歸根結蒂，是編訂小學課程標準者的自作聰明。我並非吹牛，像鈴鈴這樣的孩子，眞的不算是眞笨，他對算術尙且智力够不上，其他比較不聰明的，該是益加沮喪了。我們爲培養孩子身心和精神而敎育，千萬不要使我們的孩子沮喪。我想：小學一年級生，因為智力未充，不妨免授算術，除一到10的十個數字和國語混合敎授，予以認識外根本不必敎授加法和减法。這樣纔是眞正培養兒童身心和精神的標準課程。不知道敎育專家以爲怎樣？敬請指敎。（樓尙武，卅五，六，九。）</p>

<h3 id="c133">從北平解赴南京　巨奸十四人羣像 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 特派員張劍梅</p>
<p>本報廿五日北平航訊</p>
<p>王蔭泰　王蔭泰是解送南京十四名華北巨奸中的魁首，在日本投降的前夕，他還是華北政務委員會的委員長。今年五十八歲，山西人，早年在德國留學，有一個德國太太，當過律師，充過法官，說一口官話，有三寸不爛之舌，是一個高調主義者。七七事變後，他一直做了八年的僞官，偽臨時政府實業部長，華北政委會常務委員，僞實業總署督辦，僞華北合作事業總社理事長，僞農務總署督辦，僞總務廳長，僞全國經濟委員會委員，僞華北食糧公社理事長，後來奸運亨通，一直做了僞華北政務委員會委員長，兼僞新民會會長，他爲敵招募勞工，供敵情報，叫人民獻銅獻鐵，供給敵人大量煤炭，甘做敵人統治中國的獵犬。</p>
<p>從北平砲局胡同陸軍監獄起解的時候，他穿一身滿漂亮的茶褐色西服，白色襯衫，古銅色領帶，脚穿用大皮鞋改造的一雙皮便鞋。上飛機前檢査他的衣服時發現他的腰帶是一條白紗布綳帶，他也有點狼狽了。</p>
<p>記者問他有什麽感想，他最初不肯回答，後來很狡猾的說：「沒有話講，我的一切，華北人民都會知道的，相信政府的裁處也會公平的。」</p>
<p>在陸軍監獄門口臨快開車的時候，他對記者苦笑說：「別矣北平，恐怕我不能回來了。」卡車過燈市口，在指車　駡漢奸的人羣中，他的德國太太和三個女兒在望着他流淚。</p>
<p>齊燮元　齊燮元，在這批巨奸中，算是資格最老的軍閥了。七七事變前，這位「息影津門」的將軍就與日本特務機關眉來眼去。七七事變後，與王克敏等組織僞臨時政府，任常委兼治安部總長，其後歷任僞軍校校長，僞治安總署督辦，僞治安軍總司令，僞軍委會常委等職。在任僞職期內，迭次招募僞治安軍，先後組成十一個集團軍分駐華北各地，破壞抗戰，並且逮捕殺害過很多中央地下工作人員。</p>
<p>他今年六十二歲，在這批漢奸中是個子最高的，光頭，戴靑緞子帽盔，黑馬褂，淺灰色夾袍，緞鞋，這老傢伙紅臉瞠，厚臉皮上不時浮着笑意，但是有人問起解的感想時，他暴燥了，手拍着胸：「我沒有對不起老百姓的地方，這次我一定聽國家法律制裁！」隨後又像安慰又像解嘲地對和他銬在一起的僞北京市長劉玉書說：「市長也沒有對不起人民的事。」來一套自欺欺人的爛調。</p>
<p>殷汝耕　殷汝耕是漢奸的「先進」，十一年前的廿四年十一月，他便乘日本企圖侵襲華北，公然竊取冀東廿二縣，成立所謂「冀東防共自治政府」了。他曾接受日本指揮强迫人民出賣柳江煤礦，設立冀東銀行，包庇日鮮浪人倫運白銀出口，通州事變發生後，他與日本秘訂三大條件：（一）不許宣佈通州事變眞相，（二）不許作政治活動，（三）行動隨時報吿日本憲兵。「冀東政府」下台以後，卅二年曾應汪逆之請，充全國經濟委員會特派委員，他是老牌漢奸了。</p>
<p>他今年五十七歲，顯得老了，完全不是冀東時代的樣子。藍布大掛，罩青緞子馬甲，記者問他什麽感想，他只笑一笑：「沒有什麽話講，沒有什麽話講。」他佯作鎭靜，但不時脫帽，以手帕拭汗，身邊携有老莊的東西和「太上感應篇」。</p>
<p>汪時璟　汪時璟，偽華北政務委員會的財務總署督辦。是在這羣行列裏最漂亮闊綽的人物。淺色呢夾袍，花條呢禮服褲子，黃色薄底皮鞋，豆沙色禮帽，手提小型皮包，左右手戴白色戒指。在飛機塲檢査時，發現他的手皮包內東西最齊全：各種補藥，腓子粉，香皂，扇子，更有一密裹的小包，翻開看時是一卷自白書，並有精細裱糊硬皮宣紙白面書册一大本，大槪是預備騰寫自白書用的。</p>
<p>他的身份很難令人明白，據負責者說：他確與「地下工作」有關，他家裏有一部同中央聯絡的電台，所以當局對他也比較客氣，半年來他和余晋龢始終被軟禁在自己家裏，並沒有進陸軍監獄，直到起解前廿五分鐘，才用小汽車把他押解到陸軍監獄。但他也不是沒罪的，如發行偽幣擾亂金融等。</p>
<p>記者問他話的時候，他裝聾作啞的，老由余晋龢担任翻譯，余晋龢用手放嘴上作喇叭形，對準汪逆的耳朶：「這位先生問你還有什麼話說？」他羞愧的笑了：「沒有甚麽，沒有甚麽，謝謝你，只是慚愧，應當，應當。」</p>
<p>余晋龢　余晋龢曾歷任北京市長，僞華北政委會委員，僞合作事業總會理事長等職。他任僞職五年，曾强調勤儉增產，服從敵僞亂命，加强奴化敎育，發行居住證，捕殺抗日人員。</p>
<p>他今年五十八歲，呢帽，灰綢袍，粗布鞋，說話滿漂亮：「在北平，我沒有對不起民衆的事」。「國家懲洽漢奸，肅正綱紀是對的，但是對我們幾個人，似乎還要考慮」。又說什麽：「此次認識不淸，死而無憾」，在囚車上他四處觀望，他看見事變前許多自己的部屬，（他事變前曾任平警察局長）參加抗戰、又回到北平，甚至有的作了押解官了，他和一位舊相識談了幾句話，眼膜上已經濕潤了。</p>
<p>江亢虎　早年反對白話文的江亢虎，廿八年從美國回來寄居香港，不久便聽從汪精衛的慫慂，參加了「和平建國運動」，其後歷任僞攷試院副院長，院長，僞國府委員等職。抗戰勝利後，於去年十二月五日在北平被捕，在獄裏，他很賣弄過一番風騷，說什麽日寇統制糧食很嚴時，他在僞國府曾經主張提出抗議。在對英美宣戰時，也曾請求鄭重攷慮，可惜都沒有生效。</p>
<p>這位六十四歲的老傢伙，在離開陸軍監獄的時候，老態龍鍾，面色蒼白，好像非常害怕，戴黑邊眼鏡，黑呢禮帽，灰布夾袍，一點看不出是個美國留下學生，對記者的發問，他默不作答，但在心裏却似乎在竭力抑止不安的情緒。</p>
<p>周作人　知堂老人在北平淪陷後，忽然不耐苦雨齋的寂寞，熱心做起僞官了。他做過僞北大校長，僞華北政委會常委兼敎育總署督辦。勝利以後，國法把從苦雨齋提到了「苦獄齋」，嘗一嘗鐵窗風味。</p>
<p>知堂老人瘦得像猴，光頭，戴黃框眼鏡，着灰黃夾袍，神態頽唐。他說：「勝利以後，我就坐在家中等待國家的制裁，現在沒有什麽感想」。說話聲昔很低，苦笑着。未被捕前，他在苦雨齋中向記者辯說：他做官，做校長，是在淪陷區爲國家敎育靑年，爲國家保存元氣，他曾經幾度向日本人交涉，不叫學生們終天去參加什麽大會，免得荒廢學業。</p>
<p>在解南京的這批華北巨奸中，他的身體最輕，—僅僅五十二公斤。比着九十公斤重的僞山東省長唐仰杜，幾乎差了一半。雖然做了幾年僞官，但是比起別的漢奸，算他最窮。聽說每月家裏人到獄中去看他，只給他帶一萬多的零花。比起家裏一次送一二十萬元的鄒泉蓀，他差多了。他這次押解南京，行囊也最簡單，一個不足十斤的小包袱，裏面有兩本書，一本是自己作的「談龍集」，另一本是「朱子」。</p>
<p>潘毓桂　潘毓桂是七七事變後，勾引馬來之虎—山下奉文進駐北平的罪人。當時他負責主持維持會，曾藉詞維持治安，威嚇國軍及黨政人員，限期離開北平，引導敵軍進駐市內，並焚燬民間所藏總理遺敎和各種有關黨義書籍，以後任天津市長，完全聽從敵人的指揮。</p>
<p>在陸軍監獄裏，他曾經狡辯，說什麼他當京市警察局長，在敵人架砲攻城時，曾以身擋砲口，阻止轟擊，保全了中央黨政軍人員和市民的生命財產。在僞天津市長任內，始終沒有設置「高等特務科一，以免貽害市民。在華北懇業公司董事長任內，曾與日人折衝，分得食糧二千袋，都不是利敵叛國的行爲等等。</p>
<p>這位綽號「奸曹操」的漢奸，今年六十四歲，鬍鬚蒼白，而色發青。手提句裏，除糕點外，都是補藥。據說他的心臟病相當厲害。對於記者的發問，他沒有答覆。</p>
<p>鄒泉蓀　鄒泉蓀是淪陷期北平商會的會長，操縱金融，操縱物價，無惡不作。在勝利後，他是漢奸羣中最活躍的一個，曾經拿着數年來搜括民脂民膏的罪孽錢到處送禮，運動緩頰，可惜他的罪狀已非錢財所能遮掩了。</p>
<p>他今年四十四歲，山東福山人，穿一身灰布長衫，顯然在裝窮。他對記者說：「我相我還會很自然，因爲……」他大聲的笑着，鑲滿金牙的口腔，張得很大。</p>
<p>現在讓我寫一下他的重要履歷：僞華北商會聯合會及北京商會會長，東亞經濟懇談會華北本部部長，華北政務委員會委員。</p>
<p>劉玉書　劉玉書做過偽北京市長，華北政委會委　，四川遂寗人。</p>
<p>六十三歲的小老頭，但是看起來年紀只像四十多歲，着淺藍色薄棉袍。從陸軍監獄到南苑飛機塲的路上，他在不大習慣的十四個人坐在一起的大卡車上亂嚷嚷。他答覆記者的詢問：「我沒有話講，所犯的罪行也不容自己申辯，我的一切，北平的老百姓會代我說話的。」接着也是北平老百姓的一位記者問他：「你享混合麵讓北平人吃，還記得嗎？」他紅了臉，不說什麼了。</p>
<p>唐仰杜　唐仰杜，當過僞山東省長，也做過華北政務委員會的常委　工務總署督辦，山東鄒縣人，今年五十七歲，高個子，在羣奸中堪稱「羊羣之驢。」穿長袍馬褂，長飄胸前的鬍鬚完全白了，有人說他頗有希臘學者風，但他却是地地道道的老漢奸。</p>
<p>他還想活，不嫌羞愧的把自己的兒女做護身盾牌：「家兄在內地也是抗戰的，我的大兒爲抗戰死在昆明，二兒爲抗戰死在重慶。至於自己呢，老朽了，死去了，沒有什麽，早就準備着了。沒開始從我們的時候，我就自願到行營自首了，請政府公平處斷吧。」</p>
<p>陳曾栻　陳曾栻，當過河北省長，華北政委會常委兼農務總署督辦，今年六十三歲，河北青縣人。穿舍維呢雪靑色大褂，緞鞋，一身胖肉，到飛機塲後，他說：「快完了，還坐一回飛機」。注時璟眼瞪了他一下，似乎說：「眞不開眼！」</p>
<p>文元模·王謨</p>
<p>這批起解南京的華北巨奸中，有三個文化漢奸，除了周作人算一個外，尙有二魔—文元模和王謨。他們兩全做過僞華北委政會常委氣敎育總署督辦。</p>
<p>文元模是著名的物理學敎授，去年四月就任僞敎育總署督辦，不幸失節，殊可惋惜。他說自己是個窮敎書匠，這次去南京，帶的款子也很寒酸。</p>
<p>王謨是硏究地質學的，世界書局出有一本頗有名的世界地理，記得就是他作的。在淪陷期做過僞督辦，那天，他穿一件灰色布衫，形極狼狽。</p>

<h3 id="c134">訪世界最小共和國　聖瑪利諾 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>五月自羅馬寄·薛童傳全</p>
<p>義大利雖爲地中海上一靴形半島，彈丸之地，本身包括二個獨立國家：一爲羅馬之梵蒂岡敎皇國，一爲離羅馬北約四百公里之世界最小共和聖瑪利諾（San　Marino）。前者世人知之較棯，後國因地處徧僻，言之尙少。因値春節假日，由羅馬驅車北往，作竟日遊，歸而紀之。</p>
<p>（一）沿途訪覽</p>
<p>此次義大利受戰害最鉅者，爲義中部沿亞得里亞海西岸之里米尼城。因該城爲德軍哥德防綫之終端，其另一終端，爲佛羅倫斯。英軍與德軍在此對陣作戰，屢進屢出者，凡廿五日。故里米尼城，十室九毀，而聖瑪利諾共和國，即位於聞而心驚之里米尼城西北廿三公里。其北爲德軍防綫，其南爲英軍陣地，眞所謂處於槍林彈雨之中。—其飽受虛驚，可想而知。余先憑弔里米尼城，廢墟殘燼，映現於淸漪明媚之碧海中，宛如一片死城，心爲之酸。然後驅車往聖瑪利諾而進。路旁二行竹桃，姹紫嫣紅，濃郁燦爛，鮮　異常。車漸駛近村落，野風迎面吹來，一層淸新之氣，令人爲之神往。地勢愈進愈高，而聖瑪利諾之國都，即在形勢雄偉高峯巍崖之『鐵打諾』山上。車聲驚擾路旁莊家少女，身披輕紗，倚廬含笑，意示歡迎。蓋戰後遊人不多，而戰後國人之履斯邦者，尙以余爲第一人也。車至國境，有一長約二丈之小橋。橋旁豎一橫額，顏曰：「聖瑪利諾共和國」。是橋甫經修復。詢之，則曰：此次大戰始終保持中立，惟該橋爲唯一國際交通孔道，故不能不毀，以策國防安全。余光一日已以電話預定旅館，故到達首都時，已由旅館派招待員在城外迎候引導。旅館即以山名，爲『鐵打諾』。布置整潔，取價亦廉，旨在吸引旅遊也。</p>
<p>（二）建國小史</p>
<p>略事休息後，即參觀其政府。因値春節假日，無法拜訪其主要行政長官。僅晤見內政部秘書。承其殷勤招待，幷陪同訪覽全景。據談全國國境，共長六十一公里。人口一萬六千人，包括首都一處（人口二千人），鄕鎭八處。其建國歷史，溯源於三〇一年，由一阿刺伯之敎士，名聖瑪利諾者手創。最　僅爲一宗敎之集體，迨五四二年，始形成爲獨立國家。至一六〇〇年，正式頒布憲法，決定爲共和政體。余詢以如此蕞爾之地，如何能維持至今，不受世變之波盪？則曰：中古時代，武備不精，聖瑪利諾位於『鐵打諾』山巓，居高臨下，地勢險要。加以國民尙武善戰，故屢被外侵而不破。迨一八〇七年，拿破崙一世占領義大利，欲以附近里米尼與具薛諾二城相贈，未爲當時聖瑪利諾當局接受，因之義人迄今感激不忘。一八四九年義統一運動，加里布的將軍，避難於聖瑪利諾者，凡二日，因得九死一生，義人亦感其德。此次戰爭，收容義大利難民達一萬人，從井救人，幾至全國糧食，反生極大恐慌。惟從此義人將更不忘其所惠，而多方予以扶植矣。故其立國精神，可以國旗爲徵象。係白藍兩色。白色代表和平，藍色代表自由。其中嵌一國徽，狀爲一邊桂枝，代表榮譽，一邊柏枝，代表武力。下書拉丁字『自由』，其上有一王冠，代表『主權』。王冠之上，有一十字，代表博愛。故綜其立國精神，爲「和平·自由·主權·博愛」。常第一次歐戰時，曾激於正義，向奧匈宣戰。惟巴黎和會時，竟忘未參加簽字於和約。此次戰爭，始終保守中立。最初德國駐義統帥凱塞林，允不侵入。惟最後二個月，德軍困獸猶鬥，竟越過橋界，破壞中立，入其國境。故一部國土，竟淪爲戰場。惟首都則始終未曾遭任何方面之侵犯。其受戰損最巨者，爲一九四四年六月二十六日美機轟炸，死傷六十人。當向美國抗議，美界爲視線錯誤之不幸意外。現政府正趕辦三項統計：（一）受德軍之戰損；（二）受英美聯軍之戰損；（三）受整個戰爭影響之損失。尤以第二項最關重要，因須向英美提請要求賠償也。</p>
<p>（三）政府組織</p>
<p>聖瑪利諾共和國具有領土·人民·主權，故爲國際共認之獨立國。除憲法外幷有民刑法規。政體組織爲行政司法立法三權制。設總統二人一由首都之居民選舉，一由鄕鎮之居民選舉。例須於每星期三上午十時至十二時，爲接見公民時間，凡有困難，皆可直接當面呈訴。設下議院由民選下議員六十人組織之爲立法最高機關司法爲三級三審制。另設國務會議由下議院選定十人担任爲行政最高機關。總統之下設外交部長一人綜理外交內政兼財政部長副部長各一人綜理內政與財政全體職員共二十二人。另設十局，規模較部為小。為衛生·交通·教育·體育·公共工程·民衆戲劇·建築·出版·郵政·勞工·戰前全國僅有法西斯黨一黨現因潮流所趨亦有三大政黨一爲社會黨一爲共產黨一爲民主同盟前二者為左傾後者為右傾。現任二位總統其由首都選出者為社會黨其由鄉鎮選出者為共產黨總統及下議員任期均為半年（總統為下議院之當然議長）定每期四月一日及十月一日選舉。現在下議員六十人中，四十人爲社會黨與共產黨，其餘二十人爲民主同盟（國務會議十人即依此比例由各黨分配）故該國現由左傾黨統治。以前法西斯黨負責人員，現已被捕下獄受審。至國際關係則在法國與敎庭，派駐大使。與義大利，英國，荷蘭，比利時，美國，法國等國，皆締約設領。並曾參加國際農業協會（係一九〇五年成立中國亦爲會員國之一），國際郵政公會，國際紅十字會，國際無綫電會議，巴黎汽車交通會議，海牙國際永久法庭等。</p>
<p>（四）財政經濟</p>
<p>全國財政，以印發郵票爲主要來源。該國自一八七七年印發郵票，以式樣美觀，樂爲世界集郵者珍藏。此外，賴義政府之稅收補助。蓋聖瑪利諾國以農業爲主，全國唯產小麥與葡萄酒。每年產麥一萬五千担，除自己消耗一萬二千担外，可年輸出三千担。但一切日用物品，皆須由外接濟。爲便利義國貨物之輸入，故以不設關卡徵稅及不發行紙幣而用義幣爲條件，雙方訂立公約，由義政府年付義幣二千五百萬呂耳補助其稅收。其最後一次公約，於一九三九年訂立，最近曾由義總理加斯伯里與之修訂一次。其主要者，即規定以後聖瑪利諾國，不得辦理離婚手續。因義大利爲天主教國家，依天主敎義，配偶除敎皇特准外，不得離婚。因之義人之求離異者，皆往聖瑪利諾國辦理離婚手續。現任義總理加斯伯里爲犬主敎民主黨黨魁，爲救此編，故作此修正，以絕流幣。</p>
<p>全國有公路二十三公里，鐵路三十二公里（有隧道十六處），係一公尺窄軌，用電氣機車。係一九三二年墨索里尼所贈，當時價値四千八百萬呂耳（約合二萬四十萬美金）。戰事爆發後，爲法西斯黨破壞。目前正擬籌發公債，舉款修復。政府自有汽車四二輛，其中輛爲前任總統使用。二輛由現任總統各用一輛。最近曾有一輛損壞修理，於是二位總統，合乘一輛。交通局發出R．S．M．（即聖瑪利諾共和國之縮寫）汽車牌照約四百副，可通行世界各國。因年納牌照稅，不過義幣一千呂耳（約合美金四元），較義國爲廉。故附近義人，皆向之請照。</p>
<p>（五）國民生活</p>
<p>全國不行兵役，不徵捐稅。僅有義勇隊三百人，憲兵十二人，係向義政府借用。總統榮譽儀仗兵三十二人，係貴族之榮譽職。故國民經濟負担極輕，惟欲取得其國民資格，極爲困難。普通入境以三日爲限。三日以外，必須報請其政府核准。凡入其國籍者，依法僅限於生在聖瑪利諾國炒內，年滿二十一歲者，方能申請。惟獲准者，亦不多見。但最近左傾當政，已將國籍法略加放寬。即凡在聖瑪利諾國，居住滿四十年者，可申請爲公民，如此以後，約有三百人合格爲公民。而左傾選票，亦因此多得三百票。可見現代世潮泛濫，雖蕞爾小　，如聖瑪利諾者，亦不能免俗也。該國對有功於人世及對該國有貢獻者，得授予榮譽公民。墨索里尼因贈送鐵路三十二公里，馬可尼因發明無綫電，皆爲該國榮譽公民。最近下議院正討論擬以榮譽公民，授予美前總統羅斯福，不久即可發表云。</p>
<p>因全國安居樂業，故治安極佳，殊有路不拾遺，夜不閉戶之概。全國監獄僅有囚犯九人，其中四人，爲法西斯黨政治犯，其餘五人，爲竊賊。皆須於獄滿後，褫奪國民資格，驅逐出境。全國行國民强迫敎育，初級小學五年，共有八所（即每鄕鎭一所），初級中學五年一所，高級中學三年一所，均設於首都。另有孤兒院一所，有孤兒二十八人，曾參觀一周，布置整齊，頗具規模。此外，有新式醫院一所（有病床一百五十具），影戲院三所，戲院一所，皆由國家舉辦。建築堂皇，設備甚佳。全國報紙共有三種。一爲『鐵打諾半月刋』，係社會黨主辦，每期銷行二千份，銷路最廣。其次爲民主同盟主辦之『大鐘月刋』，再其次爲共產黨主辦之『火星半月刋』。最近民主同盟在『大鐘月刋』，著論肆力攻擊政府對發行郵票，缺欠縝密計劃，並認政府透支預算義幣二百萬召耳（約合美金七千元），未經合法手續，違法不當。惟政府方面表示，以年來義幣貶値，故政府財政，大受影響。最近擬在羅馬聘請財政專家，硏究徵稅辦法，以資挹注。可見此次戰禍之深，縱如聖瑪利諾之小國，亦爲之波及。昔之所謂世外桃源，無處復求矣。全國首都，居於山巓，瞰視全境，山巓高極，築有鐘樓。有大鐘小鐘各一，大鐘報時，小鐘報刻。鐘聲嗚處，全國皆聞。故人不需佩帶鐘表。而余寄宿一宵，亦於翌日晨光熹微，鐘聲悠嗚中，悄然離去矣！</p>
<h3 id="c135">星期論壇　原子彈防禦問題 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 趙曾珏</p>
<p>—討論原子彈能問題之五—</p>
<p>一。原子彈的威力</p>
<p>原子炸彈的正式使用，雖則還祗有兩次；但是它的威力之實際表現，已是舉世震駭！一枚原子彈，可以燬滅一個大都市，使所有其他武器都爲之黯然無色。這一個飛躍的進步，超過了人類數百年來對於武器的改進。不但具有空前的燬滅性，而且其放射能可以述續柑當長久的時期，使動物在表面無傷的不知不覺中，內部發生變化而死亡。原子彈落在日本，已有九個月之久，日本醫院中至今還有許多人在治療不可見的創傷，可爲明證。據最近報載，美國最新式的原子炸彈，其威力較轟炸日本的超過一千倍，其破壞力等於普通十噸重炸彈一百萬枝。它的威力，還在不斷硏究擴大之中。美國卽將於本年七月一日在比基尼珊瑚島舉行的試騐，頗有一舉而把整個艦隊燬滅的可能。從原子彈發明至今日，時間不過一年，據悉在美國科學家努力硏究之下，製造原料已經增加六倍，製造成本减輕一半，數年以內，凡有科學及工業基礎的國家也可仿造。倘使沒有適常的管制，則人類的刧運，正是方興未艾，世界的末日，也許不遠！</p>
<p>除了物質上的破壞力之外，還有心理上的威脅手。一遇衝突發生，任何敵對國的地點都有中到原子彈的可能。今晚熟睡的人，都不知明天是否還存在世上。這種寢食不安的情緒，可使一國的機構完全陷於麻痺狀態，還談得到什麽「無須恐懼的自由」！</p>
<p>二·積極防禦</p>
<p>唯一的積極防禦，便是擊退敵人載原子彈的飛機，不使飛臨本國上空。現在雷達的進步，確可精確測定敵機的來臨，而使本國强大的空軍去撲滅於國境之外。但是天空如此遼闊，要使一架敵機都不致漏入本國上空，是一件不可能的事。任何一架敵機的侵入，便可決定本國的命運。次這大戰中，歐洲戰場開闢之初，德國希特勒曾經誇口不使一架敵掛侵入德國上空，但是事實怎樣？除了一個短時期外，德國上空幾無日不有盟機的踪跡。凡是硏究防空的人，都還沒有發現積極防空的有效方法，也許將來有一天，交戰國的雙方飛機同時出發，等到達成任務，各歸本國的時候，各發現本國的重要都市都已燬壞了！</p>
<p>而且流星彈（卽飛彈）或無人駕駛的飛機。都在不斷改進之中，以無綫電操縱準確地攻擊敵方目標，當非難事。將來必利用載有原子彈的飛機，以超高空和超速的姿態，千百成羣，向對方進襲。那時要講防禦，將感無從措手。惟一有效的防制辦法，只有舉國努力於硏究科學及發展工業，使本國亦能自己製造原子彈和飛彈等新武器，使敵人怕我們採取報復手段，不敢輕易應用原子彈。譬如毒氣一物，在第二次世界大戰中，軸心國不敢嘗試。這就是因爲同盟國亦能製造毒氣，軸心國有所顧慮，便不敢輕易使用。足證以牙還牙確是防制原子彈最積極有效的方法。</p>
<p>三·消極防禦</p>
<p>消極防禦怎樣呢？惟有儘量疏散，以減少損害的可能。整個國家可以分成幾個自給自足的區域，而每個都市最好不使有過多的人口，凡是有幾十萬人口以上的城市，部分成若干中心區，各自有其足够的工商及水電等自給機構。像上學這樣人口多的都市，至少應分成三個或五個中心區，各個中心區間的間隙，以每個原子彈破壞力所及的範圍爲標凖。倘使有天然的山嶺壁障，便應利用這種壁障，以爲各區間的間隔。</p>
<p>根據這次太戰的經騐，人民死傷於彈片的，還不及因燃燒而死的多。炸彈所引起的火海，可以每小時九十哩的速度，把人民和城市呑噬下去。人們除了被火焰直接灼斃以外，還有因氧氣不足或遭遇氧化炭的毒而致死者也很多。所以有人主張防空建築，應當築在五層至七層的大樓上，以減少火焰的侵襲，並且要有防熱和通氣的設備。不過原子彈的爆炸力是否普通建築可以抵禦，而且原子彈的高熱也遠非普通的燃燒彈可比，所以如果有充分的氧氣儲藏地下設備，無疑還是防禦炸彈的最有效方法。重要工廠都應當建築地下，將來或許所有重要的建築物—工廠倉庫和交通設備等—都灤藏在數百尺的地下。</p>
<p>原子彈除了超過普通炸彈或燃燒彈千萬倍的摧燬力和高熱以外，還有它獨有的放射能破壞性，將來的建築物，一定要有防禦放射能的設備。</p>
<p>四·結論</p>
<p>上面所述的積極和消極防禦，都不是絕對有效的方法。現在還有一部份人相信有了一種攻擊武器，便可有一種相尅的防禦武器。但在原子時代，恐怕世上還沒有尅制原子彈的武器。唯一安全有效的方法，便是永遠消滅促成戰爭的猜忌和仇恨，最好是泯除一切國家種族宗敎信仰的界限，組成世界政府，原子能由世界政府管制。然後人們才能忘記「戰爭」二字，不再發生殘殺的事情。這一種理想，凡是有識之士都認爲迫切。三十年前的美總統威爾遜早已大聲疾呼，不幸國家問的猜恨不易消滅，國際聯盟軟弱無能，形同虛設，第二次大戰終致爆發。現在戰爭雖了。但是聯合國機構究能比國際聯盟强多少，恐怕目前無人能加斷言。不過在原子時代的今日，人類已臨到毀滅和幸福的十字街頭，已經不是空談理想，而是尋求如何實現，不容再加遲疑了。道是人類，「自覺」心的發揚，也是社會科學最高成就的表現。</p>
<p>依照目前的情勢，還不容許樂觀。一種民族和國家的狹義安全感還積亙在各國人民的心頭，侵略陰影還伸展到世界的每一個角落。人類眞是一種奇怪的動物，經歷痛苦，而還要嘗試痛苦，創造文明而又要毀滅文明！所以，我國人民不宜專事過度依賴聯合國機構，而沒有一點準備，不能專憑「理想」而忽略「現實」。還是趕快團結一致，共同努力來推進原子時代應行硏究及建設的科學和工業，以保障國家民族的安全。現在的原子彈以「鈾」爲主要原料，「鈾」是從卡諾特石或瀝靑鈾鑛提煉出來的。這兩種礦產，現在世界主要產地是非洲，比利時的剛果，美國的丹佛，德國的西利西亞，蘇聯的烏拉山和吾國的廣西及贛南。吾國如硏究製造，原料不虞匱乏。我們能製造原子彈，方可使它人不敢以原子彈來威脅我們。</p>
<p>英國是一個純粹科學前進的國家，對於原子彈的發明，她也參加領導。但是安不忘危，對於保護大英帝國自身的安全，準備沒有一天鬆懈。這次策動全國科學家從事科學硏究，無非以原子彈製造及原子彈的防禦爲目標。觀於此，我國應該何去何從，國人不難抉擇。我們相信，只有全國精誠合作，努力於科學的硏究和工業的建設，是爭取民族安全的唯一途徑！</p>

<p>主筆先生：勝利後的上海，可以說是家家缺米，戶戶乏糧，只有一般做大生意的人和大富翁，他們利用智謀手腕，潤屋潤身，校之一般埋頭苦幹面帶菜色的小民，大有天壤的分別。現在他們更利用小民缺米時候，大施手段，用重利放債米，每放白米一百六十斤，待秋收後歸還白米本利二百四十斤，這短短的三個月時期，竟要如此重的利息。小民們的心意，本不願去嚐的滋味的，可是爲了肚腹的飢餓，只好忍痛的借了下來。小民們終于被生活壓迫而屈服了！譬如一個小民耕十畝自由，一家有不得五個人，今年缺了白米二石，向他們去借貸，待秋收時如收成頂好的話，每畝收白米二石，十畝可收廿石，還去了欠債白米三石外（本利合計）尙有十七石，那五個人每年的食糧至少十五石要吧，如此計算，尙餘二石米，雜支開銷不算外，這二石米只好購幾担肥料，那末這雜支和開銷的所需要還是缺着。這樣每年欠宕下去，不知那一年才可以償淸？如此下去，恐怕農村的破產日期不　吧！我是一個窮敎員，一月所入不過二萬多一些，可是時當還要欠薪，據說縣政府也沒有錢，那二萬多一些，只可購白米六十斤，自己一個人的生活，尙難維持過去，如何再能負担家中的出支呢？所以也不得不飽嚐了上面所說的借債吃重利的痛苦了！所謂江南富繞之區，原來如此！上海縣荷溪國民小學校教員吳祥善謹上</p>

<p>主筆先生：敬啓者，吾吳縣虎丘一帶，以種植茶花爲生者，約計大小一千餘戶。平日克勤克儉，阱手胝足，藉謀溫飽。該項茶花，計有玳玳茉莉白蘭等花，實屬農產品之一，例不收稅。唯自抗戰以來，淪陷八年，處於敵僞淫威之下，侵奪搜括，不堪蹂躏，花農遭受危害尤鉅，迨於三十二年十月，猶有顧舜華者，假敵僞權勢，意圖角肉鄕民，摧殘農村，創辦茶花特捐。査我花卉一業，本屬農產，例無稅捐，故花農羣起反對。僞政府恐擾事端，且民意難違，僞爲體恤花農，尙下令撤銷。又於民國三十三年春，日商小山光弘松本起生來鄕，創設大華洋行，欺壓花農，欲圖統制，花農等繼初抗拒，致日人松本初生毆擊花農王菊甫。王君因年邁體弱，流血過多，醫藥罔效，死於非命。此爲吾虎邱花農忠於地方，忠於政府，可歌可泣之事實。漫漫八年，處身水深火熱之中，期待光明。今抗戰勝利，莫不歡呼動天，共慶昇平。忽見五月二十九日蘇州各報載吳縣參議食席上，有縣府交議，舉辦征收茶花特稅，業經省府通過。花農等見閱之下，不勝惶恐。吾花卉一業，在敵僞時期，受盡千般苦楚，今農村行將破產之際，急待政府予以援助，增進生產，恢復舊業，期望甚殷。且閱四月十一日蘇州各報載稱，財政部以各級地方政府對貨征稅條例不合，厲禁在案，况農產品歷來不入正嘗稅務，除呈請當局請求免征是項茶花苛稅外，爲特呼籲各界，主持正義，予以援助，不勝感激吳縣虎邱全體花農同啓。</p>

<p>一個人有一種內心的痛苦，不是表面的歡笑所可代表的。你看這個人表面上很高典，很愉快，如果你以爲他楚眞正的高興愉快，那你就是錯了，因爲你沒有參透這個人的生活內層。</p>
<p>俄國文豪托爾斯泰，客死於異鄕，他最後說：水裝在桶裏，太滿了，太滿了，太滿了是會流溢出來的。桶並不能發生藩籬作用。</p>
<p>這是一種靈魂上最後的絕響，也是人性上最慘痛的一種呼聲。因爲，因爲在世界上他所最愛的一個人，他明白了他對於她已經絕望，她並不能理解他，他出走，以古稀之年，客死於異鄕。然而他在世界上，甚至前後幾個世紀所發生的偉大輝煌業績，是無補於他個人所遭遇的悲劇的。</p>

<p>— 曹作漢</p>
<p>也許我還够不上描繪常熟，因爲找到常熟來也不過才有幾天，道路還未摸熟，那裏談得上寫什麽印象記。</p>
<p>然而也因爲不熟，所以多少還可以寫出點兒，如一混熟，則已爲習染，多見黑曰白，反沒有什麽好說的。</p>
<p>記得初去吳江，覺得吳江有兩個特點：一烏鴉多，二乞丐少。然而老吳江人對此決不會想一想，更不會引爲驚奇了。正如老住蘇州的，常日的擠在觀前，坐在北局，汰在吳苑，何嘗會領略到蘇州的詩意，是在冷巷中。</p>
<p>閑話少說。話說常熟風景以虞山出名。出名不一定好，這也是奇怪的事情。好玩的地方，並不是虞山，而在北門外的破山，那兒以典福寺爲中心，山上山下，寺前寺後，大有西湖一角的味兒。其地可以看瀑布，比桃源澗好得多。大致桃源幽而此地朗。桃源澗隱沒在荒烟蔓草中，如無本地人引導，也確乎難尋—有些本地人也都不知道。</p>
<p>「王四酒家叫化雞」與「石家飯店肥肺湯」是同樣馳名、王四酒家便也在破山附近，曾專誠去光顧過，雞沒喫到，飯沒有。菜沒有，有的是酒，店招倒是金字，苦了兩條腿，也不曾舒服了一張嘴。</p>
<p>虞山在城內，附近有言子墓，仲雍墓，墓碑殘缺不可讀，鳥糞獸屎，和先賢的確開的玩笑不小，本地人却沒有個說是不順眼的。山顚有一亭，名曰「鎭蛟」，關於此亭，古老的神話說是許眞人鎭蛟於此，關係全邑的風水。新近的神話，說是敵軍占領常熟後，曾在山上做防禦工事，擬在亭中掘一地道，結果挖出一古井，井邊有粗鐵練一根，敵軍挽之使起，很長很長，才拉起一個毛髮皆白的老猿來，活蹦活跳的身上毫無水跡。敵軍視爲神奇，乃恭送其返井，據說鐵練和老猿、現在還在亭中井裏。</p>
<p>一方面爲了好奇，一方面想俯瞰下全城的形勢，我爬上了虞山顚，誰知在亭中早有兵八戍哨，不曾走進，便給轟出，這倒是意外的遭際，一覽之下，尙湖總算望見，城裏城外房屋麟比，夾着一塊靑一塊綠的樹木森森。江南人畢竟是有福氣的，若在鎭江金山塔頂上望江北，極目荒涼，大有黃河以北蒼蒼莽莽的樣兒。可憐這樣一塊貧窮地方，老百姓受了「解放」之福、還要整百萬的向江南流亡。國府還都了、可憐流浪在外的人兒，幾時才能够還到他們的家鄕！</p>
<p>這兒民風很樸實，也很富厚，祇看喝酒的人，如此之多，便可想見；夕陽西下，一杯在手，在　魚醬肉花生米之間，他們已導到了他們的世外桃園吧。</p>
<p>米酒釀得很好，可惜已不在時令上，否則頗想傾囊以買一醉，如此衆生相，自顧旣不是英雄，又不是超人，醒着似比醉着難受，這並非是牢騷話。</p>

<p>— 蕭堅民</p>
<p>台灣女人的服裝，色彩異常鮮麗，形式也都別出心裁，這也許是苦悶的象徵吧！不過她們不愛穿和服，平時大抵穿裙子或速裙的外衣。宴會時也穿晚禮服。內地的小姐太太，有三兩件士林布旗袍，就可以將就些度過一個相當時期。此地則不然，家居婦女不必說，裝飾就是她們的職業。單就職業婦女，女工或下女之流，每天也須換裝三四次。她們上工去總帶個龍鬚草包，包裏的東西是飯盒一個，衣服一件，小菜或其他書一本。上午下理，打開飯盒就午餐，餐後入浴，浴後換衣裳。此地工廠機關，差不多全有洗澡設備。衣服雖鮮艷，並非濃膩惡俗，只是圖案形式繁多，與着色明朗刺眼，整件衣服，僅花一朵即佔全面積者有之；尺寸之間，佈遍蟲魚花草世間萬象者有之。道是日本經濟發展的結晶：人造絲色質柔軟，大量生產，售價低廉，此時市面棉布每尺約三十元，人造絲售價每碼不過百二十。我們湖南老家粗藍官布，穿上一輩子，還可做遺產留給兒子穿。人造絲可不行，頂多一年。漂亮纖維，全體則吿崩潰，不若粗藍官布，破了再補，又可穿它十年二十年。巴黎時裝中心，我沒到過，不過以我看法國電影的觀感來說，深覺巴黎婦女在衣服上的花樣，尙遠不及此間新穎古怪。</p>
<p>初看此間，女人似乎多於男人，機關團體低級職業工友，一律都是女人。工廠女工，照例比男工多一倍，旅館茶房，飲食業招待，商店店員，一律女人，可見男女就業，的確平等了。內地要如此，恐非三五十年不可，至少也要一二十年吧。她們大抵健康，愛淸潔，衣服燙得平平整整，周身披五彩繽紛。內心呢？却似乎都有無窮的寂寞和惆悵。有些女工十來歲上工廠，到自己女兒十來歲，也上工廠了，日子還一年一年在淸早與午後的汽笛聲中打發過去。他若公司官署，一張公事　子，眼看它主人由妙齡變少婦變徐娘是常事。這些微妙事情，大概要說也說不出來吧。所以一空下來，她們就唱，黃昏以後，滿城女人唱，收音機唱，話匣子唱，儼然是一座音樂城，年輕人愛熱鬧，自然覺得環境優美，但我們初從寧靜的都市來此的小小人物，總覺得過於嘈雜一些。（十八日寄自台北。）</p>
<h3 id="c143">冷飲陳列館 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>天文家曾預言過今年沒有夏天，我們聽了也不覺得什麽，而冷飲商聞之，會直跳起來。如果眞的沒有夏天，那冷飲品的銷路，將出一記冷門，而要永遠地凍結在冷宮裏面了。可是照道幾天的情形看來，太陽高掛，中午時節，柏油路面開始溶軟，夏天畢竟有的，天文家胡說八道，冷飲商又轉憂爲喜，破涕而笑，振作起精神，着意於生意經上面了。</p>
<p>的確，夏李是冷飲品的世界，馬路邊，街道旁，那一處不見冷飲。自初夏起展開了，直要到中秋後才靜寂起來，經過的時間那麽長。整個的冷飲季，上海人不知要消耗幾多錢於冷飲上面？否則街頭路角，何來如許冷飲商販？可惜沒有確實的統計，不然，這章消費的數字，一定大有可觀。</p>
<p>冷飲市是跟天氣的凉熱而轉變的，幾日來天氣一熱，冷飲市突呈活躍起來。在東方巴黎的上海，製造冷飲的工廠，規模最大者，當推美商海寗洋行，廠址在虹口，日軍佔領期內，曾遭毀損，機器也被搬去或毀去一部。但勝利後，經過幾個月的整理，到現在出品又（相當快速，預備在整個冷飲季中，以最迅速的方法，供給冷飲於全市食品商店。</p>
<p>提起了海寗洋行的冷飲，便會不自覺地聯想到美女牌來，美女牌是海寗洋行的特種標記，凡是海寗洋行的出品都以美女爲記，而烟兌店，水果行門口，所陳設的黃色冰箱，也有美女牌爲記。據說這種冰箱，還是戰前相得，現在是沒有了，成了奇貨，舊有的租戶，再也不肯退租或轉租給人的了。</p>
<p>就上海的冷飲市作一個鳥瞰，那麽烟兌店，水菓攤之類，大都兼營，而食品店裏、也設起雅座來，稱之曰飲冰室。門口掛起旗子，隨風招展，另有一種新的氣象，他如舞塲，酒吧，電影院，京劇館，都有冷飲供人選購，而幾個公園裏面，也設有冷飲的地方。這樣看來，我們每到一處，如果想消暑解渴，是不憂買不到冷飲品的了。</p>
<p>大世界一段食品店很多，而一到夏天，那邊也成了冷飲集中的市塲。一般的食品店，都點綴一新，設有冷飲的雅座。有幾家廣東店，還陳列了全部製造冰洪淋的機器，當衆製造。而靑年會附近有一家出售北平酸梅湯的商店，更是出名，悶熱的日子，一天到晚有靑年男女，徘了隊買酸梅湯呷。</p>
<p>再看到馬路上，凡是行人較多之處，走道上面，走不多步，就有冷飲攤子，露天擺着。桌子放滿了汽水，鮮橘水，可口可樂之類，汽水可以開瓶費，大杯，小杯，隨你意，和買茶的孩子，隔馬路對立着，這是苦力與車夫的消暑解渴之所，每年此日會出現在街頭的。</p>
<p>看到各個出售冷飲的商販所備貨品，自冰淇淋，鮮橘水，棒冰，白雪公主，汽水，刨冰到凉茶，凉粉，綠豆湯，地力膏，中西合璧，一應俱全，不啻使上海出現了一個冰飲陳列館呢！</p>

<p>— 李靈芝</p>
<p>夜街漫步，想到了我們女性的一種病態。</p>
<p>活着的時候，粟麥不辨，到死還是黑白無分，這樣的女性，在目前還是不少。這是一件痛心的事實。</p>
<p>醫治這種「女性病態」，我想我們要用開門見山法。</p>
<p>「開門見山」，這是很直截了當的辦法，叫我們女孩子們不要關在深　裏，不要儘在課室裏，不要落在廚房裏。開出門去，就可以看見崇高的，雄偉的山。這座山，就是我們所接觸到的社會。譬如，你的家是住在上海霞飛路或南京路，你走到路上一看，山固然是沒有，但你可以看到一部「無字之書」，最觸目的：一到晚上，舞女們，妓女們，成羣結隊，滿街亂舞。你自然也能看到街面上許多百貨商店的橱窗裏，閃亮着鬥奇爭妍的燈光和貨品：玻璃手袋，玻璃襪子，各色化裝品，眞假DDT，花樣繁多，於是你會思索到，舞女妓女是怎麽產生的？尤其在禁舞廢娼的呼聲很高的今日，這些可憐的女子將找到些什麽樣的出路的問題吧。在同一的夜街上，萬種事態，各式人等，會一一映入你的眼簾：一個四五十歲的，骨瘦如柴的老婦人，在洋梧桐樹旁啃老樹皮，當你看得出神或同情的當兒，一個穿得稀爛的老頭兒，突然又在另一頭迎面跑來，向你伸出討飯的手，說不定會把你嚇了一跳。在路燈所照不到的一角，一隻野狗似的東西，在垃圾堆上淘來淘去，當你走近去一看，却原來是一個三十四歲中年婦人，破衣裸體的在那裏拾荒。有年紀不滿十五六歲的孩子，拉着一掛空車向你兜生意。有漂亮的太太小姐們坐着奧斯丁轎車向地們的丈夫或爸爸撒嬌。有十幾歲的大姑娘，以懇求似的表情同美國兵兜賣鮮花，一聲聲“Best　Flower”一聲聲“Thank　you”雖然操的是洋涇浜英語，但顯然已經過了幾次三番的臨時訓練。穿得花枝招展的鶯鶯燕燕，妞妞妮妮的穿梭似的走來走去。</p>
<p>注意！這就是社會的一課！學校裏讀了死東西，到了這裏，才能變成活東西。對於自己的生活，就可以有把握地生存而且發展下去，也可以不再有違反自己的意志的事情出現，還怕什麽讀了活書會做女叫化子，尼姑，舞女，妓女，或女漢奸嗎？</p>

<p>— 馮憶</p>
<p>星東與英海軍之戰，觀者萬餘人，可稱球國盛事。香港球隊之未蒞滬土，屈指算來已有十年之久。此番以强盛之新陣容，展現於上海球迷之前，堪爲冷寂已久之上海球壇增色不少。</p>
<p>是日以「人數」而論「生意眼」，可稱賣座不惡，收入當在二千萬元以上。作壁上觀者，除三敎九流，無暇細述外，市長吳國楨，亦於開賽前十分鐘翩然光臨，但　開球禮後，又即悄然而去，前後蒞塲時間未逾二十分鐘。又前名門將張榮才，亦爲座上客，出落得肥頭大耳，身段臃腫，已非昔日之矯健可比，人謂：張自與舞姝李小妹結合後，心廣體胖，李有功焉。</p>
<p>星東此番來滬，原擬邀請李惠堂同行，李初亦應允，但李爲南華曾台柱，南華會不免有些門戶之見，故最後李惠堂以顧及大局，不願單獨行動，遂吿作罷。如吾人以生意眼而論此事，則李之不來，與「門票」之收人，實不無稍受損失也。</p>
<p>星東全體隊員十三人中，若以球藝論名次，則平心而我：門守朱兆恒應列爲「倒數第一名，回憶朱於戰時，爲香港之二流人物，乙組選手：，究屬經騐差，球藝欠老到，未可苛求也。渠之「大佬」朱赤子原爲「南華日報」之名體育記者，太平洋戰事後，正式落水爲汪逆之侍從副官，迄至勝利後，終因國法難逃，已被捕下獄矣！</p>

<p>— 漁父</p>
<p>卅三年冬湘桂之役，敵人在桂垣焚殺之慘，至今言念及此，令人不寒而慄。當夏秋之交，桂林號稱銀行街之桂東路，每値垂暮，街路上空即有一種奇觀出現，舉凡電燈電話綫上，忽有大羣燕雀數以千計，飛集其上，嗚聲不絕，夜則宿於是，晨復飛散，晚則又集，似託庇於此銀行金店氣氛中者然。此類燕雀不知何自來，且日有增加，初時僅羣集正陽路之十字街，繼乃四週蔓延。當時據桂林老者言：此爲（桂林祥瑞之一，向稱瑞烏；蓋故老相傳，桂林瑞象有三，即：八桂堂之桂常靑，乃桂林人之福，老人山之老人常健，是桂林人之祥，厚富街（即桂東路）之雀常嗚，是桂林人之瑞云。豈知不旋踵而桂林淪陷，遭刦空前，所謂桂林人之瑞者，適得其反。又聞桂垣將陷之前，七星嚴上澈夜聞羣狼號叫，酷類哭泣，其聲極哀。事後方知燕雀羣狼之出現反常，俱非禎祥之兆，豈大禍之至，禽獸亦有預感？是誠不可解矣。</p>

<p>〔端木愷律師答〕二房叔若先於其子故世，則子應繼父，媳應繼子，惟子故須在民國廿年五月五日民法繼承編施行以後，方可通用。因該編施行以前，配偶尙無繼承權也。至宗祧繼承廢止後，嗣子名稱，已不存在，收養他人之子女爲子女，須依養父母之自由意思爲之。</p>
<p>（二）臨安張定中問　甲有市屋三間於二十三年冬典與乙居住十二年，典時乙方以銀元二百元頂得，而該屋已於二十八年由甲方出絕賣與丙，惟該項典屋款早經丙方在甲方之賣價內扣除，去冬乙方住期已滿，歸丙方負責向乙方取贖，於取贖時，倘丙方以法幣二百元取贖，乙方可吾向丙方提出以銀元二百元取贖？乞賜答覆。</p>
<p>〔端木愷律師答〕所詢情形，可依復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條，請法院公平裁量，增加給付，至欲以銀元取贖，尙欠根據。</p>
<p>（三）李蘊珠問　李某在民國三十二年二月向陳某購得住房一幢，價値僞中儲券二萬六千元，當倖二萬四千五百元，計欠一千五百元，言明待淸丈後付淸，當時係敵僞時期，輾轉遷延，直至本年一月二十五日始經淸丈，現陳某聲言欠付之一千五百元，須以法幣作一千倍計算，請問貴律師：（一）當局有此規定否？遠年貨幣，應如何折合爲合理？</p>

<p>— 李平仙</p>
<p>婦女們的服裝，沒有嚴格的規定，無論出一步門，或是赴一次宴，隨你自己愛穿什麼，就穿什麼。</p>
<p>就一般人看來，大都以材料為標準，材料好，服裝就算好，圖式美，服裝就算美。其實，保溫是第一，審美是第二，但價格的貴與踐決不能視為適合於美的標準。因為人與人之間，或是所謂社交之際，目的不在於判別貧富，不在爭奇斗艷的舉行時裝比賽會。</p>
<p>現在是初夏時節了，如果你在一個夏夜的宴會中，穿一件單色的　藍軟綢的長衣，一　差不多同一色彩的鞋子，在柔和的燈光下，包管你顯得溫靜高潔，而且能博取親友的賞識。反之，即使你穿上花色繁密，價值連城的時髦綢緞，會帶給親友們以一種不愉快不美麗的感覺，因為這的確不是晚會所適用的服裝。</p>

<p>偉大的現代女性，心中應具有備　雕刻一般的力量，臉上應有沉着的敏感，眼內就有精神上的深刻性，一位美國著名女作家亞妮梅耶，在其新著「向女同胞挑戰」一文中指出了美國女子缺乏以上的優點。同時她說到別國女性的個性正在發展中，而且未來的成就大可期待。而美國的女性卻已經好像變成了「旣成品」了。</p>
<p>她又從兩個復員軍人的談吐中獲得了一點啟示：目前美國女性對男子唯一感到興趣的地方，就僅僅在那個男子身上她所能取得的東西。這裏或那裏都一樣，她們不是擠來擠去軋購玻璃絲襪之類，便是耐心地排成長蛇陣去軋購幾塊麵包。總之，她認為現代女性的視野不該如此狹窄，不要只在自己或自己身邊的男子身上打算盤。放眼到廣大的世界！</p>

<h3 id="c162">一句話殺死了曹娥 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 文霞</p>
<p>漢順帝的時候，上虞地方（今浙江上虞縣）有一家姓曹的人家，祗有父女兩人相依為命。家境十分清寒，平日靠着捉魚過日子。女兒名叫娥，祗有十四歲，生得伶俐活潑，身體結實而個性很強。她父親雖然是個中年人，因為平日操勞過度，頭髮已經有些花白了，曹娥年紀雖小，卻很懂得安慰父親。她常常撫摸着父親的白髮很自信的說：</p>
<p>「爸，你別當我女孩子，心裏不受用，我將來一定幹一些比男子還好的事情給你看看。」</p>
<p>「是不是你瞞着我，一個人偷偷地到後面池子裏去學泅水，算是在幹比男子更好的事。」父親說這句話的時候，面孔板板的，沒有一點兒笑容</p>
<p>「爸，你不要責備我罷。學泅水也不是壞事，你五月五日要跳神（跳神是在江中迎伍君神的意思。伍君神就是伍子胥，被吳王夫差殺了投到江裏的，後來的人奉他為神），你老了沒有兒子，我學會了泅水，將來可以代你做這件事。」</p>
<p>「傻孩子，你是女人，怎麼可以做祭神的事兒。」爸說着，連連搖頭頭，擺着手。</p>
<p>爸雖然很愛女兒，但他並不同意她這種逞強的舉動，他希望她做個斯斯文文的女孩子。曹娥的小心坎裏，對於他爸不了解她而阻止她的自由的這件事，也有些不很高興。因此，父親儘管不同意，她還是偷偷地去學泅水。五月五日到了，爸又去執行跳神這件事兒，可是今年的身體不大好，腳把不穩，被一陣浪潮捲去了。曹娥站在岸上，看在眼裏，馬上要跳下水去救父親，可是被一帬人拖住了。他們都說，「水深浪大，你父親不幸被潮捲去了，怎麼還要讓你去送死呢？」</p>
<p>曹娥哭得死去活來，誰都還是不肯答應牠跳下水去。牠眼看着父親被風浪吞沒得無形無蹤，而一班看得她一無用處的人還是拖住她不放，她心裏恨極了。</p>
<p>她想，捲去父親的是浪潮，殺死父親的是這一班瞧她不起的男人。現在旣不能救上活的父親，她一定要找到父親的屍體。</p>
<p>她抱了這樣的決心，不分晝夜的到江邊去守候，十六天過去了，她還沒有找到父親的屍身。在第十七天的早晨，她到母親的墳前，悲悲切切地說道：</p>
<p>「媽，你如果有靈，你該幫着你苦命的女兒找到父親，如果今天我再找不到父親的屍體，我要投江裏去找了。」</p>
<p>她離開了墓地，再到江邊，這一天她找得格外仔細，可是她還是找不到屍體的蹤影。直到太陽快將西沉，有一帬村人到江邊來洗農具的時分，內中有一個眼光特別尖銳的青年，他在遠遠的江邊，發現了一堆黑色的東西。於是他們跟曹娥一同找了過去。曹娥瞧見了這一堆東西，她不管它是不是父親的屍體，便一縱身跳到江裏去了。這一堆黑沉沉的，果然是她父親的屍體，便一縱身跳到江裏去了。這一堆黑沉沉的，果然是她父親的屍體，她抱住了屍體游近岸來，可是一個多嘴的青年大聲說道。</p>
<p>「面對面的抱住一個男子，這成什麼樣子。」</p>
<p>曹娥在水裏聽到了別人的責難，她羞得心火上昇，馬上把屍體翻了一個身，可是體力小，水勢又急，沒有把屍體抱住，卻被一陣浪潮打到江心，從此，曹娥是再也回不到岸上來了！</p>

<h3 id="c163">建設上海市文化事業管見（下） <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 劉咸</p>
<p>（六）植物園</p>
<p>動物園之外，植物園的設立，也是不可少的。植物園的教育，科學，美育和經濟價值，是和動物園差不多的，不過所佔地面要比動物園大的多。世界聞名的倫敦邱植物園（Kew　Garc'ens），栽培世界上各地的稀奇植物，有的且按照植物分類系統來栽培。國內設有極大的溫室，在像熱帶溫度的氣溫中，增減熱帶植物。他如高山植物，水生植物，都用人工造成相同的環境來栽培，好像在原處一樣。我以為在上海也應辦一所像邱園一樣的大規模的植物園。</p>
<p>（七）天文臺</p>
<p>天文臺是學術發達的標記，所以某地有一座天文臺，卽足以表現該地的文化水準是相當的高。像上海這樣大的地方，就沒有一所現代式天文臺，所謂徐家匯的天文臺，只不過是測候所罷了。為了完成上海市文化建設起見，設立一座最新式的天文臺，是不可少的。</p>
<p>（八）美藝館</p>
<p>上海雖不斷的舉行各種美藝展覽會，使愛好美藝的人們有互相觀摩的機會，可是都不過租商店的一角，或借公共塲所，展覽幾天，做些生意，並沒有一所美藝館的設立，可以永久陳列，任人觀覽。初到上海來的外國朋友，要想參觀中國的美藝，簡直沒個去處，在外國的大都市內，設立一所美藝館，陳列一些美藝品，是一件極平常的事，沒有這樣的美藝館，倒反覺著稀奇。我盼望上海市政當局，趕快設立一所有永久性的美藝館，免得外國人覺著稀奇。</p>
<p>（九）音樂館</p>
<p>為了加速上海的文化建設起見，音樂館，國劇館，歌劇館等有關音樂方面的幾所大建築物，是萬萬不可少的。一方為春天唱演出之用，同時更是研究樂　戲史的。最高的學府，和以生意經著眼的電影院，大舞臺或音樂會是大不相同的。盼望市政府本轉移風氣，改善歌樂的立塲，從速就這方面著手做起來。不要令外國人再說上海無文化，上海無文化意識。</p>
<p>（十）文藝館</p>
<p>文藝館的設立有兩種目的，一方面是便利作家有聚會的中心地點，可以舉行座談會，講演，及宴會等等為交際塲所，一方面為陳列作家手蹟，稿本及紀念物之適當處所，可供人觀摩，在歐美各國大都市，都有文藝館的設立。上海為人文淵　，作家輩出，為全國文化運動中心之一，早宜設立一所文藝館，作為上海文藝的中心。</p>
<p>（十一）兩項建議</p>
<p>除上述十項文化事業須從速建設之外，還有兩種附帶的建議，與文化事業也不無關係。第一，上海人口如此稠密，公園遊憩之塲實在在少，在市內的尤少。我建議將哈同的愛儷園收歸國有，改作公園，任人遊覽。哈同生前發了上海地皮漲價的財，現身死之後，理應取諸上海，還諸上海，免得許多義子義孫，爭遺產，打官司，第二，上海人多地貴，運動塲太少，打綱球都要花錢租塲子，這於國民體格健康，關係極大。我建議將跑馬廳改為上海運動塲，除仍可供一般市民練習騎馬之外，禁止帶有賭博性的運動設備，以便市民鍛煉身體。跑馬廳位居本市中心，各區市民前往運動遊玩，極為方便，尤可予學生課我運動的便利。這兩件事都是輕而易舉的，我們殷切地等待著市政當局的實行。</p>
<p>建設上海文化事業，並不是一椿很難的事。因為上海有許多優越的現實條件。</p>
<p>現實條件。第一，上海是我國經濟重心，金融樞紐，經費需措，比較容易。第二，上海是我國人才合聚之地，文化界人才尤多，文化建設的第二個要件是人才。第三，上海交通便利，為通國內外之門戶，文化交流，得風氣之現，物質建樹，更能迅速完成。第四，上海市區廣大，規模宏偉，建築富麗，公用事業，也很發達，文化事業一經建設，容易配合。有這種種優點，我敢說建設上海文化事業，絕非難事，只要市政當局充分了解文化事業的重要，認識上海文化建設的落後，放大眼光，高瞻遠矚，通盤籌劃，延聘專家，製成方案，迅籌的欵，分期實施，凡是應歸中央政府建設的，請求中央建設，應由市府舉辦的，即由市府實施，可由人民自動興辦的，可獎勵人民去辦。這樣一來，輕而易舉，迅速完成。</p>
<p>總而言之，上海商業氣太重了，文化建設太落後了，現在抗戰勝利，建設開始，我們應該把握時機，轉移風氣，趕快把文化事業一一建設起來，藉此增高本市文化水準，市民知識程度，並提高上海在國際文化界的地位，使上海成功為一真正現代化的都市。我們都是上海的市民，都希望上海不僅是商業繁榮，並且是文化的重鎮中。　〔完〕</p>

<p>— 姚隼</p>
<p>監獄是我的大學</p>
<p>「凡事大有好處，第一是上帝的聖言交託他們。」</p>
<p>——新約「羅馬書」第三章</p>
<p>這裏，我引用了使徒條羅致羅馬人書信上的一段話，這里所指上帝的聖言，就是真理。所以也可以說：凡事都有好處，因為可以顯出真理來。</p>
<p>真理並不是可以從幻想中得來的，而是要從實生活中去體騐的。過去，我們不是常常感覺到生活的範疇太過狹小，體騐太不夠嗎？但在平時，我們是不會脫掉鞋襪，走出知識份子的小圈子去接觸廣大，人民的生活的，縱使這樣做了，也是十分的做作和勉強，好比票友們的逢場作戲，是不能夠有深刻的了解的。況且，還要提防人們種種的惡意的猜疑和忌諱。</p>
<p>但是現在，人們卻把我投在監獄之中。如果是在家鄉，我還可以靠著親友們的援助，以及憑著我的身份，而獲得許多的便利。但如果這樣，我也不能夠有著深刻的體騐。偏偏卻把我提解到離家千里的陌生的地方來，在這里的陌生的地方來，在這里我是人地生疏，舉目無親。我的所愛，我的親友，是離我那麼遠；我的地位，我的身份，對我也毫無用處。我是被降為卑微，被剝得赤身裸體，逼得我不得不和許許多多各色各樣的人們生活在一起，成為他們當中的一員，跟他們一同挨受著苦難，也跟他們一同享受著喜樂。</p>
<p>在這里，我得以更深刻地體騐著人生，我得以從另一個角度里，去觀察人們的生活，我得以從最深遠的地方去發掘人性。</p>
<p>在監獄中，生活是最為困苦的，但是人性也是最為裸露的。這里用不著一切的虛假和偽飾，不管你是一個殺人的兇手，或者是一個小偷，但誰也不能否認自己是一個犯人，而難友們誰也不會因為你的過失而責難你。</p>
<p>這里也用不著一切的身份地位，大家都受著一樣的看待——這里是最為平等不過的。一個縣長和一個逃兵睡在一起，一個大學教授和一個種田佬結交朋友。你富有，人家也不見得會來恭維你；你窮困，也沒有人輕看你。你有地位，人家用不著來巴結你；你卑賤，也照樣可以享得一份囚糧。縱使你說你是受了冤枉，而自以為不能與旁的囚犯相提並論，但在這里，比你更冤枉的還多著呢。</p>
<p>在這里，如果人家待你好，那是因為你待人家也好的緣故；如果人家待你壞，那也是因為你待人家壞的緣故。人家尊敬你，是因為你謙虛正直；人家厭惡你，是因為你奸詐驕傲。在監獄中，大家都是患難相共的，所以需要大家的互助，而且，常常是有地位有身份的，反要依賴那些他們平日所瞧不起的人們的幫助。</p>
<p>所以，我覺得，我這次的坐牢並不是白坐的，我的苦難也並不是白受的。在這一串日子里，我知道了許多以前做夢也想不到的事情，我更懂得了人生的意義，我也體騐了在我的生底歷程中最困苦而也最深刻的生活。這在我——一個在文藝領域里學習著的人，是不無好處的。讓我再重複一次使徒保羅的話：「凡事大有好處。」</p>
<p>如果說，人生就是學校的話，那麼，監獄應該是最高的學府。而我總算有機會在這最高學府里肄業，監獄是我的大學。試翻起人類的歷史來看，世界上有多多少少的哲人，革命者和文學家，不是從這里鍛煉出去的麼？好在，我這次坐牢，並不是因為我在這世界上犯了什麼過失，而卻是有著莫大的冤屈。所以，儘管人們用毒舌來噬陷我，設下圈套羅織我，總不能把任何不榮譽的罪名加在我的身上而使我蒙羞受辱。相反地，我卻是心地坦白，處之泰然。我惟有以此自慰，並且以之安慰我的所愛，和一切關心我愛護我的親友們。</p>
<p>友愛頌讚</p>
<p>這一次坐牢，最使我深深感覺到的，便是人類之間的偉大的友愛。</p>
<p>當我們像無抵抗的羔羊似的，被套上繩索，牽著走向死亡之地，那時候我的心里顫競，我的嘴唇乾枯，我的四肢酸軟乏力，恐怖的繩索，綑綁著我，死亡的綱羅，籠罩著我，不可知的命運，正在前面等待著我。</p>
<p>我們到了一個去處，我發現了在那里面也有著人，和我一樣有著人性的人。他們給予我們以優待和便利，也分擔了我們的愁苦和喜悅。不但親友們給我以熱情的關切，難友們給我以可感的援助，就連負有監守之職的人們，也並不吝惜他們的溫情，而給我以豐富的同情。</p>
<p>在這一串苦難的日子里，我就生活在人們的友愛之中。這種偉大的友愛，使我沒有陷於絕望的境地，並且獲得莫大的慰藉。不管到了任何境地，人們都給我以同情和援助。我心里愁苦，人們安慰著我，我害病躺臥，人們挾持著我，甚至我被提解到離家千里之外的陌生之地，但我仍在人們的友愛之中得到飽滿。許多素來並不相識的人們，脫下他們的裏衣和外衣，覆蓋著我，分出他們的食物，喂養著我，而在這些細小的事物里，都飽孕著我這小小的心所荷負不了的人類偉大的愛。</p>
<p>在這苦難之中，我所承受的人類的偉大的友愛，是超過我的筆墨之所能夠形容的，也不是這小小的篇幅所能夠容納得下的。在這裏我不想逐一加以贅述，因為人們所給予我的同情的援助，純是出於一種正義的行為，而並不希望報答的，我不願在這裏空口表示感激，免得褻瀆了這神職的友愛。</p>
<p>有這些日子裏，我沒有因為自己底不幸的遭遇而掉過眼淚，卻因了人們的可感的友愛，而幾次的禁不住熱淚壓眶而出。</p>
<p>「凡是有人的地方，便有着友愛。」這是我在監獄中體騐到的一句話。當我被提解離開家鄉的前夜，跟着兩位難中的朋友們握別時，我曾經叮囑他們把這句話轉告我的所愛的，和一切關心我的親友們，並且也用這一句話壯我自己的胆。就是基於這種信念，使我雖然離家千里，孤苦無依，而沒有被痛苦和悲哀所侵襲。離家越遠，我越感到人類友愛的可貴。同時，也深深地感到人類之間，還有着正義與真理存在。她們是真理之神的兩個學生的女兒。</p>
<p>在監獄之中，我看到了那些正直的人！他們並不是什麼了不起的人物，但他們卻有着莫大的冤屈。雖然他們的衣服襤褸，遍體生瘡，但他們卻受着人們的敬重。</p>
<p>在陽光之下，我又看到了那些作惡而通達的人，雖然他們擁有權勢，富有金錢，但他們卻仍然受着人們的唾棄，連他們的父母和子女，也因了他們的名字而蒙羞受辱。</p>
<p>所以，我可以說：「凡是有人的地方，便有着友愛，正義和真理。」</p>
<p>這些事，只有顯示給那些被降為卑微的，和遭受苦難的人領悟。因為生活在自由之中的，不會感到陽光和空氣的重要；同樣地，生活舒適，心地高傲的，也不會感到同情之可貴。</p>
<p>只有孤苦無依的，才會體認到友愛的可貴；只有遭受遇害的，才會體認到正義和真理的價值，比之性命更可珍貴。</p>
<p>於是乎，我領悟到，為什麼叫化子之所以能夠沿門托　，而自得其樂；又領悟到流浪漢之能夠到處為家，而面有笑容。</p>
<p>於是乎，我又領悟到，那些為正義而遭受逼害的人，為什麼能夠泰然以身殉道；又領悟到耶酥基督為什麼甘於為世人舍身釘死十字架上。</p>
<p>我記起了以色列王大衛的詩篇：「耶和華是我的牧者，我必不至缺乏。他使我躺臥在青草地上，領我在可安歇的水邊。他使我的靈魂甦醒，為自己的名引導我走叉路。我雖然行過死亡的國谷，也不怕遭害，因為你與我同在。你的杖，你的卒，都安慰我。在我敵人面前，你為我擺設筵席。你用油膏了我的頭，使我的福杯滿溢。我一生一世必有恩惠慈愛隨着我，我且要住在耶和華的殿中，直到永遠。」</p>
<p>我願意束上我的腰帶，趿起我的鞋跟，拿起我的手杖，走遍了天涯海角，到凡是有人的地方去，去領略人類偉大的友愛，去追尋真理和正義。</p>
<h3 id="c167">再論外國電影在上海 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 顧仲彝</p>
<p>我上次在春秋寫的一篇關於外國電影的文章頗引起各方面的注意，朋友們看到的都紛紛來詢問，而我自己也覺得言有所未盡，不能不加以補充。</p>
<p>我們承認電影是最有力量的社會教育工具，盟邦如果拿有教育價值的電影到中國來營業，我們應當十二分表示歡迎的。他們如果因此而賺了我們的錢，我們也決不吝嗇的。不過，我們對於片商有兩點要求：</p>
<p>（一）明知我們中國在戰後需要普及的智識和首先上的教育，我們要求片商專運些與教育有關的影片。無聊或對中國人民有毒素的影片（在美國教育程度高也許不會有壞的影響）例如兇殺，新式盜竊，男女放浪生活，縱酒縱舞的影片，美國片商應當自動不讓他們運輸到中國來。</p>
<p>（二）片商的拆帳太高，色彩片往往高至百分之六十，而影院只拿百分之四十；因此影院不能不把標價一再的提高，而把一般貧苦的觀眾摒之於門外。片商如此高的拆帳打破了全世界的紀錄。在美國至多只能拿百分之三十，三十以上是違法的。但是他們在中國竟然無法無天，亂抬拆帳的成數，而中國電影商人在沒有其他片子可演的時候，也只好硬受欺壓。外國片商也明知中國政府是不會保護中國電影商人的，所以更是肄無忌憚，任意討價。所我希望美國片商本着盟邦友助的精神自動減低拆帳的成數。</p>
<p>我同時希望中央政府的當道者能明瞭電影事業不是商業而是文化事業。當然我們承認許多中國電影商人並不懂得電影是文化事業，而只知道如何可以賺錢來飽他的私囊，這種商人我們是應該打倒的。政府應該盡牠的全力來扶助這文化事業，扶助的方法有下列數點：</p>
<p>（一）協助文化人設立民營電影製片廠。把沒收的早些發還，資本不足的貸以巨額資金，保送電影人才到國外去學習，把公地捐給電影廠作基地……總之，在最短期間使民營電影廠立刻開始工作。</p>
<p>（二）減低娛樂捐，同時要求戲院減低票價，以資普及。我始終堅持主張最合理的娛樂捐是：話劇百分之十，電影百分之二十。賢明的政府希望大多數人都能有看電影的機會一定會考慮到這個問題的。</p>
<p>（三）用外交方式向外國片商作嚴厲交涉：不準無聊或有毒素的影片進口，命令片商將拆帳減低至百分之三十為最高。美國人是最講道理的，只要外交部派人出來交涉，我想信他們立刻會答應的。</p>
<p>（四）獎勵有教育價值的中國電影。或以資金或以免稅作為該片的獎勵。那末大家一定會爭先恐後的製造新影片了。</p>
<p>只要以上幾點做到，電影文化事業就可以納入正規而蒸蒸日上了。</p>

<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>要是有幾天，回春堂的生意不大好，老　娘就會撅起嘴來嘟嚕着：「奇怪，為什麼這幾天沒有人生病？」每逢聽見這話，廖老　連忙便制止她，說：「你不能這樣講話，我們開藥鋪原是為了救人。沒有人生病正好，我們不應當只為了賺錢，而希望人生病。要知道我們這種買賣不同於別種買賣，我們這種賣是近於慈善事業的。」可是老　娘絕不會這麼想，她只知道作買賣就是為了賺錢，不管它任何種買賣都是一個目的。賣布匹的，自然希望人家的衣服常常破，他才有生意。賣傢俱的，自然希望人家的傢俱常常壞，他才有生意。賣棺材的，自然希望人家多死亡，才有生意。同樣的，賣藥材的，自然也希望人家不斷患病，才有生意。買賣行中沒有仁義，要賺錢，就不能有良心！否則，你便別作買賣，別想賺錢。這是事實，廖老　也承認老　娘的理由，但他卻不忍那麼想！他告訴老　娘：「我作藥材買賣的初衷，是為了救人！我寧肯賺錢，不願意人家生病。」為了這個問題，他們兩口子不斷拌嘴，可誰也說不服誰！</p>
<p>回春堂的生意真正遭遇刦運了！兩個月前，不知道從哪片雲彩眼兒裏鑽出來兩位洋大夫；而且接着一批批的洋藥運到了荊旅店　不久，甚至市上開了一家洋藥房。那兩位洋大夫自己便在這家洋藥房裏面附設了個內外科診所。凡是前去應診的人一不取脈禮；二不要開方費；藥到病除，而且藥也便宜。於是兩位洋大夫在大家心裏，變成了華陀再世；洋藥房變成了萬靈萬騐的神廟。於是洋大夫的名傳遍荊州；洋藥房的生意，興隆之極。雖然少數保守分子不為洋大夫所誘惑，而究竟是少數。多數平民階級卻歡迎洋大夫的慷慨。因此，荊州的中醫，觸了眉頭，荊州的中業，沒了生意！回春堂無法例外，兩個月以來，幾乎沒有人光顧。倒是草藥偶爾還質個三五副，丸，散，簡直無人問津。</p>
<p>廖老　這一下可着了急！他可以為了希望人健康而無生意，但不甘為了洋大夫洋藥的侵略而關門大吉。他站在中醫身份的立塲，覺得中國人不應當迷信洋大夫，洋大夫的治療方法簡直是蒙古治療方法，他看見過一個大夫就用了一把剪刀，硬將那塊腐爛的瘡口挖成一個窟窿，然後塞進些棉花就完事。還有見過一個人患癆癥，那位內科洋大夫在人家的胸前用手指頭「嘣嘣」敲了一陣以後，就拿一根五寸來長的玻璃管的針，扎進患者的腕上血管裏。這一切，都使略通醫道的廖老　恐怖！他認為這哪裏是在治病，明明是給人家火上澆油，叫人家受「洋」罪！他逢人便說洋大夫如何不通，如何野蠻危險，但一面他再三聲明：他並非為自己的生意憂慮，乃是為愚昧被欺騙的病人担心！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Marshall and Zhou Enlai's Secret Talk; Communist Troops' Attack Precludes Reconvening of Pre-Truce Group; Yan'an's New Demands Contain Three Points <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Special Envoy Marshall received Zhou Enlai at his official residence on Ninghai Road at 10:00 AM this morning for a secret talk lasting two and a half hours. After Special Envoy Marshall learned of the new proposal from Yan'an brought by Zhou Enlai, he planned to visit Chairman Chiang this afternoon to convey the CCP's views. According to a certain authoritative source tonight, based on observations of the current situation, the basic attitudes expressed by the government and the CCP before the truce announcement were initially very far apart. It was only after Special Envoy Marshall's continuous mediation that a temporary 15-day truce agreement was reached, offering a glimmer of hope for peace. Unexpectedly, after the government's truce announcement was issued, the Communist troops inside and outside the passes relapsed into their old ways, launching planned offensives and attacking the National Army everywhere. Such deceptive behavior of clamoring for peace on one hand and engaging in fighting on the other hand, coming from the Communist troops, is not surprising. However, it has deepened the government's, the people's, and even allied friends' vigilance towards the CCP. It is faintly heard that, as a result of this morning's talks between Marshall and Zhou, although opinions were exchanged on the need to immediately hold the Military Three-Man Committee, given that the Communist troops in various places inside and outside the passes have not yet earnestly complied with the order to cease fire, the future of this meeting is also difficult to predict.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] It is rumored that the new proposal brought back by Zhou Enlai from Yan'an this time, although its content has not been publicly announced, has hinted at its main points to news reporters in some way. The general idea of what they plan to propose at the Military Three-Man Committee meeting is as follows: (1) Detailed methods for the truce will involve issues such as troop transportation, the takeover of Harbin, and the handling of democratic regimes. (2) Full restoration of transportation will involve issues such as how to dismantle blockhouses and remove blockade lines. (3) The military reorganization plan will discuss the implementation of attachments and dispatch of executive groups to various locations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Minister of Transportation Yu Da-wei visited Special Envoy Marshall's headquarters today to discuss the restoration of transportation. A headquarters spokesperson stated that since Zhou Enlai's return to Nanjing, Special Envoy Marshall has not yet scheduled another meeting with Chairman Chiang, and that what Zhou Enlai brought this time may be the CCP's "final price" for a permanent truce.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Representatives of the Democratic League at the Political Consultative Conference, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, and Shen Junru, took the train to Shanghai separately last night and this morning. The only Democratic League representative remaining in Nanjing is Liang Shuming. It is learned that they will return to Nanjing on the 15th. Also, Li, and Liu Dongyan, members of the Central Committee of the Youth Party, will go to Shanghai on the 11th. It is reported that the representatives of the Youth Party and the Democratic League plan to jointly issue their opinions on the current situation around the 15th.</p>
<h3 id="e2">When Local Revenue and Expenditure Cannot be Balanced, Subsidies Will be Verified and Allocated by the Central Government; Opening of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Conference <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The Conference on Revising the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System closed this afternoon. From the morning until the moment of closing, all participants debated the proposals with the utmost enthusiasm. The focus was on the "Ministry of Finance's Proposal to Adjust the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Budgets of Provinces (Cities) and Counties (Cities) for the Second Half of the 35th Year [of the Republic]". Among them, the proposal that the collection of local public grain should not exceed 30% of the tax quota was considered practically difficult. While taking into account the principle of considering the local people's capacity, it was decided to negotiate with the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Finance to allocate subsidies for 30% of the collection. Various methods were also established for those whose revenue and expenditure could not be balanced in the second half of the 35th year: (1) In accordance with the provisions of the revised principles of the fiscal revenue and expenditure system, each province and city shall prepare a statement of revenue and expenditure balance and report it to the central government for verification and allocation of subsidies. (2) Expenditure on staff salaries should be planned under the revenue from the premium on the sale of goods in kind. (3) Remote provinces and areas that have not yet been restored, in addition to following the above two methods, should request the central government to specially subsidize and borrow the necessary business expenses, and should be handled on a case-by-case basis. It was not passed according to the review opinions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The closing ceremony of the Conference on Implementing the Revised Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System, convened by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food, was held at 4:00 PM this afternoon. Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, and more than 200 guests and members attended. Xu Kan presided over the meeting and delivered the opening speech, expressing gratitude to all members for the smooth progress of the meeting, and proposed opinions such as strictly prohibiting harassment, vigorously eliminating malpractices, and central and local cooperation. The ceremony concluded at 5:00 PM. Also, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, general meetings were held, chaired by Yu Hongjun, and three suggestions from the first group on streamlining provincial and county institutions were passed. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chen Lifu's Alarming Speech</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] During the closing ceremony of the Finance and Food Conference, Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, delivered an alarming speech. It is said that this conference was a meeting dedicated to studying the fiscal revenue and expenditure system, but the results were not satisfactory. The internal cause was only a technical change, not a fundamental solution, and it was far from the goal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Moreover, our country is an agricultural country, but today's financial policy is not related to the 85% of farmers, placing the majority of the people on the brink of starvation. We should know that what China needs now is a thorough financial policy and active economic measures. If all policies and measures only benefit a few merchants, regardless of factory closures and rural bankruptcies, it would be inappropriate. Revolution lies in cultivating local autonomy, but at present, those at the bottom are all being grabbed to the top, resulting in a loss of both people and wealth, which is too far from the goal, thus forming an economy that abandons the fundamentals and pursues the superficial, and a political structure that is top-heavy, with many undesirable phenomena. After Chen's speech, the entire audience responded with enthusiastic applause.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Central Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM on the 10th. After Chairman Chiang led the ceremony, Minister Yu Hongjun reported on finance. Yu gave a brief explanation of the recent important financial measures: (1) the implementation of the national general budget for the 35th year, (2) stabilizing finance, and (3) enriching local finances. Yu also emphasized the need to reform the tax system, increase tax revenue, use gold and foreign exchange to stabilize the currency value, contract currency in circulation, and improve the banking system to promote production in order to alleviate the current financial difficulties. He concluded by saying that the most important issue in our country's finance at present is how to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure. He hoped that the CCP issue could be resolved soon, so that political stability and transportation could be restored, which would allow for the circulation of materials, stabilize prices, and gradually reduce the burden and suffering of the people.</p>

<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 10th] President Ju arrived in Hankou at 1:00 PM on the 10th aboard the E Province Government's special ship, Jianjia, from his hometown of Guangji. After disembarking, he visited Cheng Qian, He Chengrong, and his old friend Xiong Shili. When reporters visited him at his residence and asked about his return to his hometown, he said: "The situation in the countryside is very peaceful, and the spring harvest is abundant. Although there are too many types of apportioned donations, the villagers are quite distressed. However, today, suffering can be openly stated, which, compared to the eight years of occupation, can be said to be suffering but not really suffering." When asked about the amnesty issue, he said: "This case has been shelved in the Legislative Yuan after it was proposed, and there is probably no concrete decision at present, which is regrettable." President Ju will attend a banquet held by all sectors of Wuhan tonight. He plans to stay in Hankou for a week and then take a boat to Chongqing to deploy the resumption of work of the Judicial Yuan before going to Nanjing. Rumors that he will return directly to Nanjing are inaccurate.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The National Government issued an order on the 11th: "The late Director of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, Dai Li, was loyal and pure in thought and courageous in action. He participated in the revolution at an early age and faced danger repeatedly. In the Northern Expedition, his strategic military achievements were great. During the War of Resistance against Japan, he was transferred to manage military intelligence, and he worked diligently and effectively, enabling him to anticipate the enemy's movements and overcome difficulties. He also concurrently handled the work of eliminating traitors, without rest. Unexpectedly, he died in a plane crash. Recalling his past achievements, we deeply mourn his death. The late Director Dai Li should be commended by a public order and posthumously awarded the rank of Lieutenant General. He should be given a public funeral in accordance with the example of those who died in battle as commander-in-chief of a group army, and the relevant department should provide preferential treatment for his pension. His life's deeds should be stored and announced to the historical museum to show the government's sincere remembrance of his meritorious service." This is the order.</p>

(2) Resolutely oppose the transportation of Communist troops from Guangdong Province to Shandong and request that the order be withdrawn immediately to avoid increasing the suffering of the people of Shandong.

Please increase the relief funds according to the proportion of 100 million yuan allocated to northern Jiangsu. Chief Secretary Wu Wending promised to forward the request to the Chairman.</p>

<p>Zaozhuang Finally Captured</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 10th] Communist troops finally captured Zaozhuang. According to Zhu Yulin, a squad leader of the defending troops who escaped from Zaozhuang to Lincheng, the Communist troops used explosives to blow up tunnels dug in advance to reach the city at 7:30 PM on the 9th, destroying the command post of the defending troops under Wang Gang. They then launched a heavy attack, breaking through the defenses and causing street fighting, eventually resulting in a state of chaos. The commander of the defending troops, Wang Gang, government representative Duan Zhijing, and their entourage are missing and their fates are unknown. Regiment Commander Wang Jimei led the remnants of the troops to break through the encirclement and was wounded, and his whereabouts are unknown. Zaozhuang was thus captured by the Communist troops. It is reported that Messia, the U.S. representative of Transportation Team No. 22, may have been detained by the Communist troops.</p>
<p>Battle Situation in Various Places in Tai'an</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] Military news on the 9th: (1) The four passes of Tai'an have been broken through by the Communist troops, and the National Army has retreated to the city to defend it.

<h3 id="e11">Hong Kong Government Protects Traitors; Guangzhou Newspaper Criticizes in Editorial <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] The Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Daily continued to operate and attacked the Allies during the Japanese occupation. Recently, the Guangzhou Military Headquarters determined that the newspaper had assisted the enemy and, after investigation, confirmed that its President, Ling Weixiu, should be listed as a traitor. The Hong Kong National Daily specially published an editorial on the 7th denouncing Ling's crimes and urging all Hong Kong overseas Chinese to pay attention to Ling's actions and the transfer of the Overseas Chinese Daily's assets to prevent him from escaping justice and upholding the law. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong government ordered the National Daily to cease publication for one month on the afternoon of the 8th. The Zhongshan Daily also ran an article titled "We Protest, We Accuse," arguing that this was an unfriendly action by the Hong Kong government. The editorial specifically pointed out, "The Hong Kong government has the obligation to arrest and extradite those who assisted the enemy. Not only has it not arrested Ling Weixiu, but it has also suppressed the newspaper that criticizes Ling Weixiu and represents the public opinion of the Chinese people. No matter what the actual intention of the Hong Kong government is, the Chinese people cannot but feel regret. This action by the Hong Kong government clearly has the suspicion of protecting Ling and speaking on his behalf. Therefore, we cannot but protest to the Hong Kong government and accuse the people of justice all over the world. At the same time, it also pointed out that the National Daily is sponsored by the Central Propaganda Department, which is well known to the Hong Kong government. Now the Hong Kong government has taken such a severe measure against the agency established by the Chinese government in Hong Kong, which is regrettable." The editorial concluded by saying that at present, many Chinese people, given the fact that the Hong Kong government does not act according to the wanted list of our government and automatically orders the Overseas Chinese Daily to cease publication immediately, doubt whether the Hong Kong authorities are really sincere in strictly implementing the cooperation measures that have been formulated. Furthermore, the press in this city is paying close attention to this incident and plans to take unified action to express a solemn protest.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] It is learned that: (1) The capital of Jilin Province will be permanently established in Yongji. The Northeast Headquarters has no intention of moving the Jilin provincial capital. The previous establishment of the Jilin provincial government in Changchun was temporary. After Liang Huasheng took over as acting chairman of Jilin, former chairman Zheng Daoru led a small number of staff from Shenyang to Beiping yesterday. Rumors here say that Zheng will replace Zhang Ting'e as mayor of Tianjin. (2) The Northeast Headquarters is currently repatriating Japanese prisoners at a rate of 6,000 people per day, returning to their country via Huludao. The area under the National Army's control is gradually expanding, and the task of repatriating Japanese prisoners is becoming increasingly heavy. Therefore, the Shenyang Japanese Overseas Chinese Management Committee has been placed under the jurisdiction of the Headquarters.</p>

<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 10th] Official intelligence reports indicate that Communist troops are reinforcing the Northeast without slowing down despite the fifteen-day Northeast ceasefire agreement. Communist troop movements are still frequent on the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway line, with large numbers of Communist troops heading northeast via Peiping.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 10th] Today marks the fourth day of the ceasefire. The sounds of war drums still resonate between the Yellow River and the Songhua River. Official sources report that the Communist forces are fiercely attacking Lafa, Wukeshu, Taolaizhao, and Hailar in the Northeast, as well as Dezhou, Yongnian, Gaomi, and Liaocheng in North China. Official analysis suggests that Communist leaders, anticipating the imminent ceasefire order, ordered the capture of the aforementioned locations as quickly as possible before the order was issued. However, due to the late arrival of the order, the Communist forces began their attacks after the ceasefire took effect.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 10th] Military News: Around 10,000 troops from the Communist 2nd Brigade and 2nd Division launched a fierce encirclement and attack on our champion force thirty kilometers east of Yongji around 3 PM on the 7th. Fierce fighting continues as of the time of this telegram.</p>

The Headquarters will have an Adjustment Office and two intelligence sections and is scheduled to depart for Changchun from Peiping on the 12th.</p>
<p>[United Press Changchun Dispatch, 9th] For the first time in twenty-five years, the Communist army has suffered another defeat in "positional warfare." The first instance was the Jiangxi campaign from 1930 to 1935. This time, it occurred in the Northeast. The Communist forces, equipped with heavy weapons obtained from the Japanese Kwantung Army, waged a desperate thirty-two-day defense of Siping Street, reminiscent of the Battle of Stalingrad. Although the Communist forces sought to transform Siping Street into the so-called "Stalingrad of the Northeast," the National Army, with its superior quality, shattered their heroic dreams. The prolonged struggle in Siping Street considerably delayed the National Army's advance into the Northeast, but the crushing defeat at Siping Street severely damaged the Communist elite troops, forcing them to continue their retreat into forests and mountainous areas in other regions. Amidst the mountains of war spoils, the reporter witnessed the Japanese heavy weaponry used by the Communist forces, such as heavy machine guns, light machine guns, countless mortars, binoculars, automobiles, rifles, etc., along with a large quantity of Japanese pharmaceuticals. The National Army in the Northeast, due to its excellent training, experience, and equipment, displayed high morale in combat, knowing that they were reclaiming territory from the Russians.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Executive Yuan Relief Administration Plans Four Major Projects: Improving Water and Land Transportation in Guangdong; Dredging the Pearl River and Completing the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Guangzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration’s (UNRRA) Eastern Branch has drafted four major plans to improve transportation and promote social welfare in Guangdong Province. The most important of these is to dredge the Pearl River to allow ships to navigate at any time, without having to wait for the tide. UNRRA has already allocated 4,500,000 yuan for surveying work. UNRRA engineering expert Feiler is currently in Shanghai, trying to obtain dredgers, pumps, and barges. The total budget is 81,657,160 yuan, with UNRRA covering 20 percent. The remaining funds will be jointly covered by the Guangdong Provincial Government, the Guangdong Customs, and the Pearl River Dredging Bureau. The Pearl River has become severely silted during the seven years of Japanese occupation. Even inland river steamers can only enter and exit during high tide, causing much inconvenience for passenger and freight transport. Before the war, ships could freely enter and exit, and ships with a displacement of 2,500 tons could directly reach the port of Guangzhou. The Pearl River is the main river of Guangzhou, and dredging is considered necessary by the shipping industry and other sectors. The second project is to complete the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway by the end of this month. This project is being undertaken by the Guangdong Provincial Government, with UNRRA providing flour for the workers’ meals. Before normal railway transportation is restored, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Highway will compensate for the shortfall. The third project is to repair thirty-six dikes in the Pearl River basin and build the Baobao Water Conservancy Project, 35 miles southwest of Guangzhou. UNRRA will provide flour for the workers' meals. These dikes protect 1,776,000 mu of farmland from flooding, safeguarding 2,782,000 residents in the area from threats. The total cost of labor and materials amounts to 2,875,310,000 yuan. UNRRA has allocated 1,946,000 pounds of flour as part of its donation. The final project is to develop the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island, which are known for their natural resources and suitable environment. Up to 5,000 war refugees will have the opportunity to participate in resettlement and development on the Leizhou Peninsula. The first batch of 1,000 people will develop Hainan Island. This project will be implemented in cooperation with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and with the approval of the UNRRA headquarters. Hainan Island produces hemp, ramie, tobacco, beaver pelts, and hogs, while Leizhou Peninsula mainly produces agricultural crops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Guangzhou Dispatch, 10th] The entire Guangzhou-Hong Kong Kowloon highway has been repaired and will be open to traffic in a few days. Once this road is completed, it will greatly contribute to the inland transport of supplies and import-export trade.</p>

<p>The National Youth Army's term has expired in May, and all members will be transported back to their hometowns within this month. Those in the Southeast region, divided into the Marine General Team and the Yangtze River General Team, will be concentrated in Shanghai and Nanjing before being dismissed. The first group of over two thousand people arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and various circles in this city will hold a comfort meeting this morning.</p>
<p>Tracing back to the initiation of the Youth Army, it was during the spring and summer of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944]. At that time, the Japanese invaders launched the Xiang-Gui Campaign, Dushan fell, and Guiyang was in imminent danger. The situation in the War of Resistance was extremely tense. The Supreme Commander then issued the call "Ten Thousand Youths, Ten Thousand Soldiers," launching a movement for educated youths to join the army. Aspiring youths from all over the country arose in response, abandoning their pens for swords, and enlisting in the army in Chongqing, Qijiang, Luzhou, Wanxian, Guiyang, Xi'an, Kunming, Ganzhou, Yong'an, and other places, forming nine Youth Divisions. They were ordered to complete training in the shortest possible time, so that they could be sent to the front lines at any time to participate in the holy war for national liberation. By the early autumn of last year, the enemy surrendered, and the War of Resistance ended in victory. Although the young patriots did not have the opportunity to serve on the battlefield, the task they undertook can be said to have been completed. The military authorities then changed the battle-oriented education into preparatory officer education, scheduled to expire and demobilize in May of this year, so that these one hundred thousand youths could return to school if they desired to study, find employment if they desired to work, or continue to serve in the military if they desired to do so, each fulfilling their aspirations and finding their place. We express our utmost respect for the return of these one hundred thousand youths after their demobilization. Taking the opportunity of the arrival of the first batch of two thousand youths from the Southeast region Youth Army to Shanghai, we briefly write down our feelings to encourage the aspiring youths of our country.</p>
<p>First, you joined the ranks of the revolution in the autumn when the War of Resistance was at its most critical, becoming a strong force in the War of Resistance. Especially in the Southeast region, where most areas had fallen, the youths, unafraid of hardship, abandoned their pens for swords, which is truly commendable. Now, with the mission completed, you are demobilized and return to your respective positions. You should be able to maintain your original aspirations, saving the country and loving the people, and becoming cadres for national construction. You must know that the difficulties of national construction will be ten or a hundred times greater than those of the War of Resistance. Looking at the domestic phenomena in the ten months since victory, with all the disturbances and chaos, one can see that this statement is not false. We have not yet embarked on the right track of national construction. The reasons for this are undoubtedly numerous, but the most important thing is still the social disorder, the restlessness of people's hearts, and the even greater lack of discipline. In this chaotic, noisy, squalid, and superficial social environment, how can the revitalization and construction of the country even begin? Fortunately, you have all received rigorous military training and spent a year and a half in military life, having long cultivated excellent habits of valuing order, abiding by discipline, and being able to govern yourselves, act autonomously, be self-reliant, be strong, help each other, and cooperate. After returning to society, if you can still cherish these most precious habits, endure hardships and hard work, and set an example for the people, then the unhealthy atmosphere of today's society will surely be transformed by you, so that every person can be like you. The ancients said, "Scholars cannot but be broad-minded and resolute, for their burden is heavy and their road is long," which is almost exactly what applies to you. You are still young, with pure aspirations and strong spirits. In this prosperous and superficial metropolis, you should be especially vigilant, paying attention to the lurking traps at all times and in all places. A slight carelessness could lead to a misstep. Haven't you heard people say, "Society is a big melting pot"? You must be determined to be a piece of real gold that is not afraid of fire, and never be assimilated by the environment. Otherwise, if you drift with the tide, what can you say about transforming society? We wish you all the best, relying on the valuable training you have received, to practice what you preach, to fight against the environment, and to create a new world. This is what it means by "heroes create the times." Only in this way can you be regarded as cadres for national construction.</p>
<p>Second, everyone knows that it is not easy to start a business, especially the great cause of revitalizing and building the country. Our country has undergone eight years of arduous War of Resistance, suffering immense trauma and deep pain. Looking around the country, we see devastation everywhere. We all feel that the future of national construction has a heavy burden waiting for us to shoulder. Moreover, our material conditions are far inferior to others. Other countries have already reached the era of atomic energy research, while we are still lagging behind in the confines of industry. To speak of national construction, we must "catch up head-on." In the process of catching up head-on, we will encounter countless difficulties and obstacles, which require us to overcome them with perseverance and courage. Chairman Chiang, in his address to you on the 3rd of this month, also encouraged you to maintain the virtue of "hard work and endurance." The army serves on the battlefield, which is certainly "one drop of blood for every inch of land," but the same is true in the cause of national construction, truly "one share of spirit, one share of enterprise." We have seen the Soviet Union before the war, calling on the people to tighten their belts and build a socialist country, with the Five-Year Plan completed in three years. And now we see the post-war Soviet Union again, asking the people to tighten their belts and work hard on industrial recovery. We are a backward country, and we need to devote ourselves to the fullest extent. Fortunately, you have already trained your bodies to be like bronze muscles and iron bones. You are not afraid to carry any heavy burden, and you are prepared to endure any hardship. Some shortsighted people fantasize about living a comfortable and happy life after the war, but you, with your youthful aspirations, are determined not to indulge in self-deception. We also believe that you will not only not slacken in your work, but will also work even harder to complete your greater mission in the future.</p>
<p>The National Youth Army of one hundred thousand has begun to demobilize, and soon those who seek to study will study, and those who seek employment will be employed! In the past, you were a strong force in the War of Resistance; today, you are cadres for national construction. The burden is heavy and the road is long; may you all encourage each other!</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, June 10 Broadcast: In order to break the stalemate in the major powers' policies towards Germany, the United States is preparing today to send a note to the Soviet representative stationed in Paris. If the Soviet side continues to refuse to recognize Germany as a single economic unit, then Germany will be divided into two, and the current one world will become two worlds. U.S. officials believe that in terms of policy toward Germany, the four powers have reached a crossroads. If Germany is not recognized as a single economic entity, then the clause on reparations in the Potsdam Agreement must be abolished, and the division of Germany into two must be implemented.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] London, June 10 Broadcast: Rumors that Britain and the United States have agreed to establish a German federal government are inaccurate. This matter is still under consideration, and Britain and the United States will not immediately submit it to the Council of Foreign Ministers. Detailed measures have not yet been formulated.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, June 9] Tonight, before several British cabinet ministers delivered speeches to two protesting crowds at a Labour Party meeting, where they were drafting guidelines for the government's future domestic and foreign policies, Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton urged the elimination of misunderstandings and suspicions between British and Soviet relations. He stated: If the people of Britain and the Soviet Union can advance shoulder to shoulder in a strong alliance, then European peace can be guaranteed; otherwise, evil consequences will occur, and Germany will seize the opportunity to rise again, seeking its dream of controlling the world.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, June 9] Today's Pravda editorial, recently broadcast by Moscow Radio, stated: Bevin's recent speech in the British House of Commons has psychologically constituted a real preparation, thereby completely abandoning the principle of mutual cooperation among nations. In practical terms, this speech attempts to take advantage of the failure of the Paris Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference to impose pressure and threats on the Soviet Union. We cannot remain indifferent even if we want to. Regarding the various issues discussed at the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference, Foreign Secretary Bevin still insisted on the position adopted by the British representative at the meeting. It is reported that Soviet newspapers' comments on Bevin's speech are the first time.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, June 10] The United Nations Economic and Social Council has been in session for three weeks so far, and there are many differences of opinion on various important issues, but it is still hoped that this session will end on June 18. The United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union still have inconsistent opinions on major issues, and the Soviet Union's position is contrary to that of Britain and the United States, which is almost the same as the situation in the United Nations Security Council. There are now at least four committees working on redrafting the various proposals put forward by the temporary committee. The purpose of these proposals is to eliminate the different opinions expressed by the representatives during the ten lengthy meetings, which involve various economic and social issues, methods for resolving these issues, and which appropriate institutions should handle them. The Council hopes to pass various proposals at this meeting, create permanent committees on human rights, economic occupations, statistics, social issues, transportation and communications, and also approve proposals on refugees, assisting in the reconstruction of war zones, promoting freedom of reporting, and establishing the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] London, June 10 Broadcast: British Chief of the General Staff Montgomery arrived in Egypt today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, June 9] Field Marshal Montgomery left for Egypt this morning to hold an important meeting to discuss the defense strategy of the Middle East in order to adapt to the needs of the era of aviation and atomic bombs, and to plan a defense plan to protect imperial properties. The urgent issue in Egypt now is what Britain will do after the British army fulfills its promise to withdraw from Egypt.</p>
<p>Dispute Focus of Treaty Negotiations</p>
<p>According to reliable diplomatic sources, the difficulties in the current Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations are two: namely, (1) Britain agrees to withdraw its troops from Egypt, but requires retaining land and air force bases in the Suez Canal area to protect its vital imperial lifeline to India. (2) Britain requires adding a clause to the treaty allowing British troops the right to return to Egypt in emergencies. Egyptian people believe that with this provision, Britain can rebuild Egypt at any time under the pretext of this "emergency." It is now known that Britain's plan is to establish bases in Transjordan and possibly also establish bases in East Africa.</p>
<p>Various Speculations on the Purpose of the Visit to Egypt</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, June 9] Experts here believe that the main purpose of Montgomery's visit to the Middle East is to study the military disputes after Britain decides to withdraw from Egypt. Some experts believe that in the event of a war directly affecting the Middle East, Britain will be prepared to abandon the value of the Suez Canal. The recent war has proven that the Mediterranean Sea is a captive sea, and in terms of new tactics, the Suez Canal is extremely vulnerable to being rendered unusable. Therefore, it is believed that Britain's new strategy in the future will focus on navigation around the Cape of Good Hope and the flight of aircraft across Africa. This tendency already existed during the Second World War. The English-language "Egyptian Gazette" reported that Montgomery's trip will definitely discuss new defense bases and defense plans for the Middle East, and a proposal to regard East Africa as a new British base to replace Egypt. It is reported that Montgomery will arrive in Cairo the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Broumana, Syria, 9th] Representatives from seven nations—Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Transjordan—as well as Palestine, convened yesterday for a meeting of the Arab League Council, lasting three and a half hours, held in secrecy. It is anticipated that the meeting will result in the establishment of a unified Arab policy to support the Palestinian Arabs in resisting Jewish immigration and to support Egypt's national demands. The meeting's chairman, Transjordan's Foreign Minister Shuraiqi, stated before the start of the closed-door session that no power in the world could prevent the Palestinian Arabs from demanding their legitimate rights. Syrian Prime Minister Mibri Bay stated that the convening of this meeting serves to demonstrate to the world that the opinions of the Arabs cannot be ignored. Arab League Secretary-General Azzam stated that the withdrawal of foreign troops from Syrian territory was a result of the League's efforts, and therefore he expects that the Palestinian issue will also be resolved satisfactorily. After the meeting, the delegates split into two subcommittees and passed a resolution in support of the recommendation of the Arab Heads of State conference held two weeks ago, which was to block the implementation of the Anglo-American investigation proposal. The Palestinian representative attending the meeting was al-Husseini, Chairman of the Arab Higher Committee. Egypt was represented by Senate President Haikatar, former Prime Minister Nokrashi, former Finance Minister Ebert, and former Chief Justice Ramadan. All major Arab issues will be discussed during the meeting.</p>

<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 10th] Reliable sources stated today that once the final plan for Indian independence is finalized, Governor-General Wavell is prepared to grant the Muslim League five seats on the 12-member Executive Council of the interim government.

The Executive Committee is expected to pass a resolution today or tomorrow, expressing its position. Indian political figures here believe that the Muslim League's acceptance of the British Cabinet delegation's proposal is conditional upon the hope of obtaining equal representation with the Congress Party in the interim government. Congress Party President Azad stated that he has not yet agreed with the Governor-General on a date for a meeting. Muslim League President Jinnah has reported the details of his talks with the Governor-General to the League's Executive Committee. As for the Indian princes, they have not yet expressed a final opinion. The Council of Princes will meet in Bombay on Friday, and it is understood that the general sentiment among the representatives is to accept the British proposal.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] The National Maritime Union announced today that unless sailors achieve their goal of reduced working hours, the union will strike on the 15th of this month. Oil tankers, riverboats, and even foreign ships arriving in the United States will join the strike. The current working hours are 56 hours per week. Government mediators advocate maintaining this level, but granting sailors one day of shore leave every 14 days with full pay. Shipowners claim that reducing time at sea would require onshore accommodation, inevitably increasing expenses and placing the U.S. shipping industry at a competitive disadvantage worldwide.</p>
<p>The union declared that any government action attempting to investigate, arbitrate, or discuss temporary agreements regarding the sailors' strike would be rejected. They stated that such plans do not consider the union's interests but merely delay matters in order to erode the workers' resolve. This declaration was unanimously passed by the National Committee of the Maritime Union. The forty members returned to their bases with strike plans and $1 million in funds. The declaration denied that the strike was motivated by any political reasons.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 10th] Suzuki, secretary of the Sakhalin Island Farmers' Association, and twenty other Japanese refugees arrived in Wakkanai, Hokkaido, today after drifting for three days in the Soya Strait on a small sampan from Houghton Port. According to Suzuki, after the northern part of the island was ceded to the Soviet Union, the Soviet army generally treated the remaining Japanese residents mildly. Japanese workers operate the island's pulp mills under Soviet supervision, but Japanese shops have all been closed. Since February 5th of this year, all banks have been nationalized, and the Japanese yen has been uniformly converted to rubles. Rice production continues as usual. Most Russians have been relocated to Sakhalin Island, but most are single men. These people are purchasing houses, and the Japanese are being forced to move out. Rumor has it that Japanese residents will be repatriated to their home country in August or September. Among the senior Soviet officers, some are second-generation soldiers. There are also Japanese officers in the Soviet army who are of Soviet nationality.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 9th] According to reliable sources, negotiations between the Iranian central government and the autonomous government of Azerbaijan Province, which had originally seemed promising, are now facing new difficulties. After Prime Minister Sadana expressed his willingness to accept the province's various demands, the province's representatives made further demands, the most important of which was that the Sadana cabinet must be reshuffled before the agreement is officially established. The reason given was that as long as the opposing cabinet members remain in office, they will find ways to prevent the implementation of the agreement, and all issues cannot be resolved. However, in fact, a cabinet reshuffle will encounter major difficulties. According to Iranian traditional customs, the Prime Minister cannot demand the resignation of cabinet members; this is the prerogative of Parliament. According to those close to the cabinet, rumors that the negotiations have broken down are not true; correspondence between Tehran and Tabriz remains extremely frequent.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 9th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin is feeling very disappointed with the current world situation and will return to Paris again this week, reportedly to make "one last effort" to get the Soviet Union to cooperate for world peace. About thirty-six years ago, Bevin gave up his job as a coachman to organize the dockworkers' union, wanting to "do something" for the dockworkers. Now Bevin, who is nearly sixty-five years old and considered by some to be one of Britain's greatest Foreign Secretaries, is still in the same spirit, wanting to "do something," this time for the ordinary people suffering or often starving around the world.</p>
<p>Bevin is not optimistic about the upcoming Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in Paris, but according to people close to Bevin, "the success or failure of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is of such great importance that Bevin must make another effort." Although Bevin is very disappointed with the Soviet Union's rigid attitude, he is not surprised. He has only been Foreign Secretary for seven months, but he is not a novice in diplomacy. He served in Churchill's wartime cabinet for six years and participated in person whenever major British foreign policy decisions were made. According to people in the British Foreign Office, the then-British Foreign Secretary Eden and Bevin were often inseparable.</p>
<p>After the Labour Party cabinet was formed, it continued the previous British foreign policy. During the 1945 Labour Party election campaign, it enthusiastically declared that relations between Britain and the Soviet Union could be closer after the Labour Party came to power. However, the current situation is that Moscow's expression has not been friendly, and the so-called closer relationship with the Soviet Union is still a big question. However, Bevin may not think so, because if he thought that cooperation with the Soviet Union was impossible, he could have remained silent. Rumor has it that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov does not like Bevin, but he respects him.</p>
<p>Bevin is well aware of the difficulties of his work, but he does not show any sign of backing down. Last time he went to Paris, he said at a cabinet meeting before leaving: If peace is broken in any way, I will notify you.</p>
<p>Bevin likes to speak straightforwardly, and when he argues with the Soviet representatives, he is unwilling to show any weakness, but this has not diminished his patient and pleasant demeanor.</p>
<p>During the last Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, he often sat stiffly in an easy chair, with no expression at all. He was willing to let U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes' opinion be completely consistent. According to his entourage, if there was any trickery at the meeting, he could immediately see what kind of meaning was contained behind the trickery.</p>
<p>Bevin has always been skeptical of the Communist Party, and this did not start today, but this attitude has not diminished his repeated negotiations with the Soviet Union. Bevin believes that using trickery will never be successful, and he does not care about personal grudges.</p>
<p>On February 1st, when he addressed the meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations in London, he said: The reason why the world is threatened is because Moscow is constantly using propaganda to attack Britain and using the Communist Parties of various countries as tools to attack the British people and the British government. The next day, the Daily Mail, run by the Conservative Party, published an editorial saying that Bevin's speech was a frank and challenging statement issued by the spokesperson of one strong country to another. But a short time after he spoke so solemnly and condemned communism, he and his fierce rival, Soviet representative Vyshinsky, "drank to the workers."</p>
<p>On May 27th, just after the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference adjourned, Bevin sent a telegram to Molotov, asking him to have "patience, tolerance, and understanding" when the Soviet Union was in contact with the Western powers. He returned to Paris with this hope.</p>
<p>Although some people disagree with Bevin's policies in the British Empire, the withdrawal of British troops stationed in India and Egypt, and the delegation of British-administered land to the United Nations, his firm stance on the Soviet Union has won the support of both the Conservative and Labour Parties.</p>
<p>A friend of Bevin said: "Bevin wants to restore Britain to 'greatness.' He believes that cooperation with the United Nations can achieve this goal."</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Atlantic City, USA, 10th] President Truman gave a radio address last night, urging the American people to unite as they did during the war to end the suffering of millions of war-affected people. According to the President, it was easy to understand who the enemy was during the war, and all disputes were easy to overcome. But today, although the external threat has been avoided, justice and security do not automatically follow. For this reason, the American people must continue to fight against the lurking enemy. The enemy is internal strife, indifference, hardship, famine, and all disasters in the troubled world.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Sino-American Hospital, which is about to start accepting patients in the city, was formerly Baolong Hospital. It was originally for the use of the medical school of National Tongji University for internships. According to Tongji, when the school was converted to a national institution, Baolong became the school's property. It was not German property. Therefore, the Executive Yuan issued an order on March 18 of this year, stating that "the entire Baolong Hospital should be returned to Tongji." Now, more than 500 Tongji students have returned to Shanghai since the resumption of classes, even leading to accommodation problems. Therefore, they have been appealing to all parties for days, striving to recover the hospital as soon as possible, and have sent three student representatives to the hospital to negotiate.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] More than 40 Tibetan National Assembly representatives, who have come to Shanghai this time, have been widely welcomed by all sectors of society. Yesterday, our reporter made a special trip to the Jinshan Hotel to interview Zha Sa Kai Moba, director of the Bureau of Secular Affairs, the Tibetan representative, to talk about Tibetan scenery. At that time, Madame Kai was sitting cross-legged in bed, reciting sutras. Her scriptures were wrapped in a colorful satin scarf and placed in a yellow lacquered wooden box.</p>
<p>Kai told the reporter that the religious atmosphere in various parts of Tibet is extremely strong, which is completely different from places like Beijing and Shanghai. Dialects also differ from place to place. Lhasa is the political, economic, and cultural center of Tibet, producing the most wool. Among the residents from other provinces who are engaged in commerce, those from Beiping, Xikang, and Yunnan account for the majority. Most of the local residents are engaged in agriculture and nomadic life. Regarding education, Tibetan is the main language. Ordinary schooling, completing six years, is already considered higher education. The curriculum includes geography, history, mathematics, and other general courses. Most people can recite scriptures, so the general level of knowledge is considered average. However, not many people learn Chinese, and even fewer learn English.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Women Are Not Skilled in Cooking <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>There are very few professional women in Tibet, and there are no women serving in government agencies. Most upper-class women are not skilled in cooking, and even if they know how, they never go to the kitchen themselves. The average age of marriage for men and women is 18 or 19. The common system is monogamy, but there are also polygamists.</p>
<p>For Tibetan entertainment, people usually gather to sing and dance, and there are dance performances. A grand gathering is held every month, and a large-scale gathering is held in July every year. Transportation in Tibet is quite inconvenient. To travel to and from the mainland, one can take the route through Qinghai and Xikang provinces, but it is most convenient to transfer through India.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zheng Liangbin, the former supreme advisor to the puppet propaganda department, was interrogated for the first time at the special criminal court of the High Court in Tilanqiao yesterday morning. Zheng is from Ningbo, 45 years old, and has always worked in the shipping industry. In March 1933, he surrendered to the enemy and served as the executive director of the enemy-controlled China Shipping Company, and also concurrently served as the minister of the shipping department. Later, he also served as the director of the puppet construction department's Shanghai office, a special foreign affairs committee member of the puppet central political committee, the general manager of the puppet National News Agency, and the supreme advisor to the puppet propaganda department. However, Zheng still tried to argue and deny in court yesterday, claiming that he was forced to join the puppet regime and that the puppet positions were just nominal. After strict questioning in court, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<p>In addition, the court also heard the cases of (1) Lu Laiguang, from Nanhui, 39 years old, who served as the deputy director of the tax management section of the puppet Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Administration, relying on the power of the enemy's military police to specialize in buying houses and selling bricks, tiles, and wood; (2) Wang Luqing, the deputy manager of the puppet Fuxing Bank; (3) Wang Abing, an enemy secret agent. All cases were investigated and postponed for further questioning.</p>

Xu is from Kaiping, Guangdong, and served as the acting editor-in-chief of Wang Jingwei's organ newspaper "Zhonghua Daily" and the deputy director of the "Central News Agency," a mouthpiece of the enemy's propaganda organ "Alliance Society," specializing in promoting "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and propaganda of the "peace movement." However, Xu actually said that his surrender to the puppet regime was after contacting the central government in 1928 and was instructed to take the position. The cases of Sun Fei and Lu Jinsheng, the secret agents of the puppet police bureau's political department, were also postponed for further questioning.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jiangshu Middle and Primary School Principal Xiao Zhenpei, who was charged with raping female student Wang Qianying, was tried in the criminal court of the local court yesterday afternoon. The defendant was defended by lawyer Yu Congdao. Wang Qianying did not attend, but her mother, Wang Xiuying, appeared in court. Judge Xie asked, "Since you suffered so much, why did you withdraw the charges?" She replied, "The defendant's side repeatedly came to cry and beg to withdraw, so I filed a statement requesting it." He asked, "Have you already received 800,000 in compensation?" She replied, "Yes, but 300,000 was taken by the lawyer." At this point, the defendant's lawyer stood up and said that according to Article 217 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the charges can be withdrawn before the conclusion of the first-instance debate. Judge Xie then ruled in court: "This public prosecution is not accepted, and the defendant is released on bail." This sensational case of disrupting public morals was thus settled with a "note"!</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the victory, DDT has become an extremely popular disinfectant in this city, but most of it is taken advantage of by profiteers and has very little effect. The specially made "Ghost Head" brand DDT of the American DDT Company in this city has another chemical added to it, so it not only kills insects with its chemical traces, but also has the effect of "Flit" insecticide. After spraying in a room, mosquitoes and flies die immediately. The company also sprays for customers in this city for a very small fee, and issues a written guarantee, guaranteeing that there will be no mosquitoes and flies rampant within one month. The company is scheduled to disinfect the staff dormitory on the fourth floor of this newspaper today, so that colleagues can all sleep peacefully and spend the summer without worry.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to news from the insurance industry in this city: In the past four months, cargo theft along the Huangpu River in this city has increased daily, with an average of 6% of cargo stolen from each cargo owner. A certain American insurance company has had to pay out between US$20,000 and US$30,000 per month in compensation for this in the past few months. If this theft situation does not improve, insurance companies will be forced to stop accepting cargo theft insurance. It is reported that most of the thieves are stevedores and idlers at various docks. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Cholera Spreads: Hope that Citizens Will Be Self-Aware; Authorities Must Not Neglect Improving Environmental Hygiene <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The spread of cholera is currently threatening the lives of all Shanghai citizens. According to a report from the Health Bureau, as of the day before yesterday, 126 cases of the epidemic have been discovered in the city, with 13 deaths. This number may not seem alarming for a city of four million people. However, the key point is that it has only been a few days since the Dragon Boat Festival, and the weather has only started to get hot in the last three or four days. There is still a long period in the long summer. If the cholera spreads at this rate, it is truly chilling to think about. Seeing this year's situation, we cannot help but recall the great epidemic of 1932. According to the statistics in the book "Cholera" by Wu Yunde and others from the former Port Quarantine Station, a total of 100,666 cases of the epidemic were discovered throughout the country that year, with 31.8 deaths. The detailed numbers for Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beiping are as follows:</p>
<p>Location | Number of Patients | Number of Deaths | Mortality Rate</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Shanghai | 4,260 | 317 | 7.4</p>
<p>Nanjing | 1,588 | 373 | 23.5</p>
<p>Beiping | 493 | 391 | 79.3</p>
<p>From the table above, we can draw two conclusions: First, in 1932, the number of cholera cases in Shanghai reached more than 4,000, and this newspaper has pointed out before that this year's objective environment, due to various factors such as population concentration, housing shortages, poverty, and ignorance after the war, cholera has a greater possibility of being rampant. There are now fewer than 1,000 epidemic beds in Shanghai, and if preventive measures are not taken to actively prevent and eliminate cholera bacteria, the future is truly unimaginable. Second, although there were so many cases of the epidemic in Shanghai in 1932, the number of deaths was relatively small. On average, only seven lives were lost for every 100 patients, which is much better than Nanjing's 23 deaths per 100 people and Beiping's 79 deaths per 100 people. What is the reason for this? It can be said that the main reason is that the number of people vaccinated against cholera in Shanghai is relatively large.</p>
<p>Vaccination can produce two significant effects: First, after vaccination, the chance of contracting the disease can be reduced to 10%. In other words, if you originally had a 100% chance of contracting cholera, after vaccination, there is only a 10% chance left. Secondly, if you unfortunately still contract the epidemic after vaccination, then your probability of death is still much lower than that of people who have not been vaccinated. It is estimated that the mortality rate of the latter is roughly 25 times higher. The effect of preventive vaccination can be seen from the statistics of Shanghai from 1928 to 1931:</p>
<p>Year | Number of Vaccinations | Number of Patients | Number of Deaths | Mortality Rate</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>1930 | 537,034 | 128 | 16 | 12.5</p>
<p>1931 | 761,279 | 482 | 57 | 11.8</p>
<p>1932 | 1,062,609 | 4,260 | 317 | 7.4</p>
<p>1933 | 940,600 | None | None | None</p>
<p>The number of patients in the above table has no comparative value due to other factors. It is worth noting that the mortality rate decreases every year with the increase in the number of vaccinations.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Not Afraid to Repeat Old Sayings: Pay Attention to Daily Life <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>However, to be precise, vaccination cannot give you absolute protection. The most important thing is to have a strong body and pay attention to hygiene, so that cholera bacteria have no chance to take advantage of the weakness. The reporter is not afraid to repeat old sayings and here again puts forward a few points that should be paid attention to in daily life: (1) Drinking water must be boiled, and street cold drinks must not be eaten. (2) Flies should be killed as much as possible. The fundamental thing is to eliminate the environment in which they breed. Doors and windows should be fitted with screens, and at least food utensils should be covered with screens. (3) Vegetables should be washed clean and thoroughly cooked. Raw fruits should be peeled before eating. (4) Try to pay attention to personal hygiene, stay away from patients, and do not touch the bowls, spittoons, and clothes used by patients before they have been disinfected.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to shout loudly: The spread of cholera has reached a very serious juncture. Administrative and health authorities must take action quickly, reasonably solve the housing shortage, and thoroughly improve the sanitary environment, so that cholera bacteria have no place to grow. In this way, combined with widespread preventive vaccination and the self-awareness of all citizens, we can work together to eliminate this epidemic tiger that threatens the life of every individual at all times.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Huang Fusen (former deputy inspector of the Central Police Station), the deputy inspector of the Special High Class and Criminal Section of the Second Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, was heard yesterday afternoon. Wang Ming, who had worked underground, testified in court. He said that when he was working in Shanghai, Huang, disguised as a beggar, arrested him, slapped him in the face, and said sternly, "You want to resist Japan in Chongqing? What are you resisting in Shanghai?" He also insulted the leader and confiscated six of his pistols and two hand grenades, and harmed his son, so he hated him to the core. While speaking, he trembled all over, his voice choked, and said with tears in his eyes, "I wish I could bite him three times!" But Huang absolutely denied his statement and hired a lawyer to defend him. The court ordered that sentencing be held on the afternoon of the 17th. Also, the case of French national Sari and Eminov destroying our underground radio station and using our radio materials to aid the enemy has also been concluded and is scheduled for sentencing on the same day.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch from Xichang] The Border Residents Education Research Institute of the Xikang Province Reclamation Commission is studying the practical issues of border residents' education in order to enhance the effectiveness of border education. It recently convened the first border education symposium to discuss how to promote education for border residents.

<h3 id="e83">Xu Shaodi Returns to Hangzhou, Discusses Zhejiang Education, and Hints at Weariness <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] Xu Shaodi, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, returned to Hangzhou on the afternoon of the 7th after reporting his duties in Beijing last month. A reporter interviewed him, and he discussed the following points: (1) The plan to concentrate high school graduates for military training for one year before they can continue their education or find employment will be temporarily suspended this year due to insufficient preparation. (2) The budgeted number of publicly funded students, normal school students, and vocational school students in the province is more than two thousand less than the actual number. Minister of Education Zhu is very concerned about this and has promised to strongly advocate for additional funding from the Executive Yuan. (3) There may be changes to the methods of public funding and other benefits in the next semester, but the central government has not yet decided on the principles. (4) It will be difficult to restore the provincial-level people's education practice school, the Huazhong Agricultural School, the Hangzhou Senior Agricultural School, as well as the Girls' Middle School and Fisheries School for the time being. The previously planned establishment of a girls' normal school and a technical school is naturally out of the question. (5) The movement to respect teachers should be promoted. Those in charge of the recent movement in Shanghai and the enthusiastic people in society are all admirable. However, the principle that scholars should be poor and not take what is unrighteous seems different from raising donations to save Qing dynasty refugees. There must be some consideration for the propriety of respecting teachers by having their students beg from their neighbors to give to them. My narrow-minded view may be overly pedantic. (6) During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the educational institutions in this province suffered great losses and were severely weakened. Like a person after a serious illness, they must be properly cared for and nurtured. It will not be a matter of a day or two to restore their health. Recalling the past eight years of war, when schools traveled through rugged and desolate lands, or in and out of enemy-controlled areas, their ability to maintain education and barely survive depended entirely on the benevolence of the central government, the protection of the provincial government chairman and colleagues, and the arduous efforts and responsible dedication of colleagues in the provincial education community. As an official in charge of education, I have been constantly worried about making mistakes for the past eight years. Now that the responsibility of nation-building is even more arduous, I am aware of my lack of talent and feel overwhelmed by the task. I am determined to resign from the position of Director of the Education Department. (Skinny)</p>

<h3 id="e89">Peking University Alumni Association to Commemorate Su Jiarong and Set Up Memorial Tablet to Commemorate Zhang Xinfu <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Alumni Association of National Peking University has scheduled a meeting at 2:00 PM on the 16th of this month at the Xinzha Road Elementary School, at the intersection of Xinwen Road and Xiaoshadu Road in this city, to commemorate the late alumnus Su Jiarong. Su, courtesy name Yancun, was from Teng County, Guangxi Province. He graduated from the Department of Philosophy of the Faculty of Arts of National Peking University in 1920. He was very devoted to saving the country. While studying, he often wrote articles for various newspapers to discuss current affairs and awaken national consciousness. He was especially active in the May Fourth Movement. He was an expert in geography and first created the "Historical Evolution Map of Chinese Geography," covering the changes in territory and the rise and fall of national power from the time of Yu Gong to the Republic of China. He also created the "Sun Yat-sen Industrial Plan" based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nation-building strategy, detailing plans such as port construction, river management, and road construction for the reference of the Chinese people. He also created the "Map of Transportation Aggression by Various Countries in China" to alert the Chinese people and encourage self-strengthening. After the January 28th Incident, he specialized in making various anti-Japanese maps, such as the "Map of Japanese Invasion of Northeast China," "The Province of Rehe and Northern Hebei Invaded by the Brutal Japanese," "Map of Japanese Invasion of Rehe," "Map of Japanese Invasion of Southern Jiangsu," "Map of Japanese Invasion of Shanghai," "Map of the Situation of China and Japan," "1/1,000,000 Map of the Three Eastern Provinces," etc., all of which shocked the Chinese people and aroused their shared hatred of the enemy. Later, when the government moved west, Su believed that he was engaged in cultural education and could not leave Shanghai for a while. After the fall of Shanghai, he remained in seclusion. Although he knew that he was under the enemy's tyrannical power, he still worked day and night to provide the Chinese people with unyielding maps of the Northeast, such as the "Complete Map of the Republic of China," "Far East Map," and "Pacific Map," often hinting at the enemy's movements to warn the Chinese people. As a result, he was resented by the enemy's military police department, who pointed out that the map did not include Manchuria, considering it a great act of rebellion. He was arrested on July 11, 1944, and all the maps he had made were taken away. He was detained for ten days and subjected to beatings and waterboarding. Su was physically weak and suffered internal injuries as a result. He sought treatment in every possible way, but to no avail. After the victory, he continued to write in order to make a living, but his illness worsened. He died on December 28, 1945, without any savings and in a desolate state. It was also learned that the school's alumnus Zhang Xinfu was killed during the takeover of the Northeast. A memorial tablet will be set up and a memorial service will be held on the day of the commemoration of Su to jointly commemorate the two loyal alumni.</p>

<p>City Schools Paid 20 Million, Private Schools 130 Million; More Than 30 Schools Have Not Paid Yet</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Student Fundraising Payment of the City's Respect Teachers Movement Committee has collected 20,831,200 yuan from city schools and 138,048,100 yuan from private schools. Except for the donations raised by university students, which are distributed to various universities separately and are currently being processed, more than 30 middle schools have not submitted their donations on time. According to general opinion, the donations from all the shops in the city are public funds from the citizens of the city. The formalities should be completed to maintain school discipline and show respect for education. It is reported that a small number of schools that have not paid have been inquiring with the committee because they did not understand the procedures, and are paying one after another. In addition to collecting the second tuition fee or raising funds on their own and the government subsidy of 20,000 yuan per person, the Respect Teachers Committee is currently planning to allocate 200 million yuan to private school teachers. City schools do not collect tuition fees, nor do they raise funds on their own. The Respect Teachers Committee only allocates 16 million yuan per person in succession. It seems that private schools are better than city schools. However, according to experts, the numbers are not much different (Ren)</p>

<p>Literacy Education</p>
<p>Methods have been drafted to promote literacy education for the general public, and a committee for promoting literacy education for the general public has been established. The first phase is from July to September of this year. Teachers and staff of all levels of schools and students above high school will be used to carry out this literacy education work during the summer vacation of all levels of schools. All out-of-school people aged 12 to 45 are ordered by all Baojia to enroll.

<p>My third son, Lingling, is six years old this year. He entered the first grade of elementary school in February. He is a smart child. After studying for more than three months, he can speak Mandarin decently, and he can write small pencil letters as big as the squares on the exercise book, clearly. His grades are not bad, but his written arithmetic is relatively immature. One day a month ago, Lingling told me in frustration, "Today, the teacher said that I can't do arithmetic and scolded me." I asked him what arithmetic he was doing, and he wrote an equation with a pencil: 2 + ( ) = 5, saying, "The teacher asked me to write a number in this bracket, but I don't understand, and I can't write it, so the teacher scolded me." I usually don't criticize the teacher in front of the child, so I said to Lingling, "You can write a 3 in the bracket, and 2 plus 3 is 5." Lingling clapped his hands and said, "That's right, that's right!" A kind of innocent and completely unpretentious expression made me feel the cruelty of the educator. Why scold him and make him frustrated?</p>
<p>In the recent short month, Lingling has learned subtraction from addition. Three days ago, Lingling again complained to me in frustration, "Today, I couldn't do arithmetic, and the teacher scolded me for being stupid!" I asked Lingling what arithmetic he was doing. Lingling said, "The teacher said it was subtraction: My brother kicked 4 shuttlecocks, minus my brother kicked 2 shuttlecocks, how many more shuttlecocks did my brother kick? The teacher asked me, but I couldn't answer, so the teacher scolded me for being stupid." I comforted Lingling, "You are not really stupid, and you are not stupid. Subtraction that is so difficult, children as young as you, of course, can't do it." Lingling asked in surprise, "Then why did the teacher scold me for being stupid?" I replied, "Because Teacher Guang is smarter than you!" This answer is beyond the child's understanding. I was criticizing the teacher out of temporary anger. Young children are not omnipotent. Teachers should consider their intelligence and teach them well. They should not open their mouths to scold them for being bad and close their mouths to scold them for being stupid, so that their weak minds are constantly subjected to strikes that they should not be subjected to. To be honest, this is the teacher's fault, the teacher's stupidity.</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought that this is not only the teacher's fault and stupidity, but also the fault and stupidity of those who formulated the primary school curriculum standards. The teacher teaches addition and subtraction, all based on the nationally designated textbooks, and the nationally designated textbooks are compiled in accordance with the primary school curriculum standards. In the final analysis, it is the self-righteousness of those who formulated the primary school curriculum standards. I am not bragging, children like Lingling are really not considered stupid. He is not intelligent enough for arithmetic, and other less intelligent children should be even more frustrated. We educate to cultivate children's body and mind and spirit, and we must never make our children frustrated. I think: first graders, because their intelligence is not sufficient, may as well be exempted from arithmetic. In addition to teaching the ten numbers from 1 to 10 in combination with Mandarin to recognize them, there is no need to teach addition and subtraction at all. This is the standard curriculum that truly cultivates children's body, mind, and spirit. I don't know what the education experts think? Please advise. (Lou Shangwu, 1946.6.9)</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Singapore Eastern Football Team has had two wins in two matches in Shanghai. Tomorrow at 5:30 PM, they will still play the Jewish team at the Recreation Ground. Both teams have made new adjustments to their lineups, as detailed below:</p>
<p>Singapore Eastern Team</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaohong</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng, Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Luo Weiquan, Huo Hua, Feng Kunsheng</p>

<p>The Singapore Eastern Team has been contacted to play in Beijing, but the opponent is problematic, so although the Singapore Eastern Team has expressed its acceptance, the date and other details are difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Regarding the Chinese Athletic Association match, Wang Xinheng and E Lvgong, the persons in charge of the Qingbai and Donghua teams, have said that there are no problems. Xu Wenkui, You Liang, and others are also determined to help make it happen. The Athletic Association has scheduled a meeting tomorrow to discuss its lineup and match date.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Construction of Gymnasium Floor to Be Openly Tendered <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Income from Six Matches Exceeds 17 Million</p>
<p>The Basketball Committee held a four-team championship match to raise funds for the construction of the gymnasium floor, and Kunyu and the Chinese Athletic Association performed an exhibition match. A total of six matches were held before and after. According to the committee's announcement yesterday, the total revenue (excluding expenses) was 3,574,000 yuan for the first match (including 1 million yuan in donations), 3,044,000 yuan for the second match (including 500,000 yuan in donations), 4,008,000 yuan for the third match (including 50 million yuan in donations), 4,103,000 yuan for the fourth match, 425,000 yuan for the fifth match, and 1,755,000 yuan for the sixth match, for a total revenue of 16,909,000 yuan. Including the Kunyu team's donation of 100,000 yuan for souvenirs, the total is 17,009,000 yuan. The Basketball Committee expressed its deep gratitude to all parties for their enthusiastic assistance. However, this amount is not enough to cover the cost of building the floor, so the committee is trying to raise funds through donations. As for the construction of the floor, it will be carried out through open bidding (see the details in the advertisements published by the committee in major newspapers) and is scheduled to be completed before the end of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Hao Gengsheng Public Lecture: Review and Outlook on Chinese Sports; Shanghai as an Experimental Zone for Implementing Ideal Sports <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Hao Gengsheng, a sports supervisor from the Ministry of Education and standing committee member of the National Physical Education Commission, recently came to Shanghai. Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, took the opportunity of Supervisor Hao's visit to Shanghai to invite him to give a public academic lecture yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. Physical education teachers from various public and private schools in the city and staff from social education institutions attended the lecture with great enthusiasm. Director Gu of the Education Bureau and Director Shao Rugan of the Gymnasium accompanied him to the venue. Director Gu gave an introductory speech, and then Supervisor Hao began his lecture titled "Review and Outlook on Chinese Sports." The key points of the speech are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Hao stated directly that the original title of today's lecture was "Recollections of Chinese Sports During the War of Resistance and Today's Outlook." Due to time constraints, pre-war sports facilities were not included in the review. Today's lecture starts from 1938. In that year, the National Government moved its capital to Chongqing. The government's first serious concern was the inadequate physical fitness of conscripted soldiers. As a result, the examination standards had to be lowered from Grade A to Grade B, and even Grade C. On average, only 49 out of every 100 men passed. In other words, less than half of the men in the rear area who were serving in the military for national defense and resistance against the enemy were qualified. At that time, people in the sports community were alerted, especially those in charge of sports administration, who should quickly seek solutions for improvement. Therefore, in the spring of 1939, a sports plan was drafted, divided into three main parts: the first part was sports administration, including organization, laws, and funding; the second part was school sports, divided into implementation plans for physical education in colleges and universities, secondary schools, and primary schools (promulgated in 1940), as well as minimum standards for physical education facilities in schools at all levels; the third part focused on physical education teacher training, including ten points: increasing quantity, improving quality, hiring foreign professors, sending students abroad, registering physical education teachers, holding summer workshops, teacher training classes, military and police physical education training, normal school physical education training, and establishing a research center. Regarding the future outlook, there are also six points: (1) Implementation and development of the national physical education plan; (2) Review of the standards of next year's National Games and the World Games the following year to seek new performances; (3) Review of the effects of this war of resistance; (4) Necessity of adopting the principle of focusing on key areas; (5) Shanghai as an experimental zone for implementing ideal sports; (6) Aerial sports activities. The discussion was thorough and precise, and it was truly the most important and valuable conference on education at present. After the lecture, which lasted until after 6 PM, Director Shao delivered a thank-you speech, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Yesterday, rumors spread in the black market that our country was researching a currency system reform, which stirred up some people. The market opened slightly higher, but the upward momentum was weak. After the opening, the price fell from around 1.88 million to the opening price. The Central Bank allocated 279 taels to the industry at a price of 1.865 million, at which point the market was still very stable. However, the US dollar was again stimulated by settlement demands and rumors, and the gold market was passively pulled up. Around noon, it rose to 1.9 million, then hovered around 1.89 million. In the afternoon, the demand for US dollars increased, and arbitrage buying surged, rising to 1.91 million before slightly stabilizing. After 2 PM, the pressure of next-day settlement increased, and the price fell slightly, fluctuating around 1.895 million. As a result, it was 50,000 higher than last Saturday. Ornament gold was 10,000 yuan higher, silver bullion was flat, and silver dollars rose slightly. Black market interest rates ranged from one dime to one and a half dimes.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies, especially the US dollar, saw a large settlement from the pharmaceutical industry, and the price rose higher and higher. There were rumors that the official exchange rate would be raised to 3,000 yuan, an old story repeated. From an initial 2510 yuan in the early morning, the price gradually rose to over 2600 yuan. Around noon, it was around 2590 yuan. In the afternoon, buying interest surged again, rising to over 2650 yuan before slightly falling back. As a result, it was 145 yuan higher than last Saturday. Gold hedging was squeezed to 725 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong banknotes were lifted by the US dollar and Hong Kong telegram rates by 10 yuan. Indian exchange rate was 535 yuan, Hong Kong exchange rate was 442 yuan. A certain bank had a large cotton settlement, and the US dollar exchange rate was flat officially but sluggish unofficially.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Cracking Down on Speculation and Eliminating Waste; Decision to Strictly Manage Foreign Exchange <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Since the Central Bank implemented strict foreign exchange controls, the city's import and export associations believed that it hindered the development of their business and hoped to improve it. A reporter from the Joint Credit Bureau visited the person in charge of the Central Bank to understand the meaning of the management measures and whether there was any intention to change them. According to the official, the bank designated several banks to handle foreign exchange in order to develop international trade and support domestic industry and commerce. For more than a month, the situation has been good. However, after reviewing the reports of various designated banks, it was found that many applicants for foreign exchange were not merchants in the industry, and many only purchased fruits, cosmetics, and other items, hoping to profit from speculation. It was also found that some merchants purchased foreign rice, which could not arrive until the end of September, missing the timeliness of relieving the food shortage, and the foreign exchange they requested was often several million US dollars. Some trading companies only had a signboard and did not register with the government according to the law, but also applied to purchase foreign exchange. The bank was ordered to manage foreign exchange in order to support the development of industry and commerce, so that the materials for production and construction could be continuously imported. Unexpectedly, such a phenomenon occurred, which is truly regrettable. In order to avoid wasting foreign exchange, strict management must be implemented. All legitimate import and export merchants will be absolutely protected, and designated banks are advised to pay close attention. Except for import and export trading companies established before the war with more than three years of history, and those registered after the war, they are not allowed to apply to purchase foreign exchange. In short, the bank's measures are for the sake of the entire country and not for speculators. The established measures not only have no intention of changing for the time being but should be strengthened.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to avoid wasting foreign exchange, the Central Bank will conduct a thorough review of the foreign exchange applications of various merchants, examining whether the foreign exchange they requested was used to purchase goods as scheduled, and whether the purchased goods arrived as scheduled. If there are any cases of hedging or falsehood, severe penalties will be imposed. Moreover, the foreign exchange fund prepared by the bank is very sufficient. For legitimate merchants transporting materials related to the national economy and people's livelihood, the scale will be relaxed, and the supply will be provided as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Bulls Emerge; Government Bonds Decline <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a certain bull faction collapsed, and government bonds fell slightly. The C bonds opened slightly lower at around 6,000 yuan. Some northern dealers emerged, and bull factions also sold off their holdings. After the opening, the price gradually fell to 5,600 yuan before slightly stabilizing. Around noon, it fluctuated around 5,850 yuan. As a result, it fell 300 yuan compared to last Saturday. A and B bonds fell 400 yuan, and D and E bonds fell 300 yuan each.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Chinese Stocks Gradually Decline; Foreign Stocks Also Unable to Rally <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The interest in Chinese stocks has waned again, and after the opening, the price gradually declined. At high prices, Yongsha was 5,920 yuan, Meiya was 4,420 yuan, Jingfu was 320 yuan, Xinguang was 308 yuan, and Qinxing was 240 yuan, all declining steadily. Before noon, Yongsha retreated to 5,600 yuan, Meiya to 4,150 yuan, Jingfu to 290 yuan, Dongxin to 215 yuan. The price rose slightly around noon. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Yongsha and Meiya suffered small setbacks, and Jingfu and the other three small stocks fell by half a percent. Cold stocks also fell by half a percent to one percent. Veteran stocks were also weak, and foreign stocks were still difficult to rally. There were too many chips, making it impossible to push up the price. Yisha opened slightly lower in the morning, fluctuated narrowly, and had little trading. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Gangye was flat, and the rest all fell.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Yarn Market Trading Listless; Cotton Trading Still Good, Cotton Cloth Weak <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market still showed no improvement yesterday. The price of 20-count large yarn was flat and sales were weak. Small and medium-sized factories intended to supply, but there were few buyers, causing the price to continue to fall by more than 10,000 yuan. 42-count double yarn and 32-count fine yarn were particularly sluggish, falling another 50,000 to 70,000 yuan. Weaving factories not only did not buy, but also sold off, resulting in no way out and making the price even more difficult to support. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual, with prices of 20-count to 80-count yarn generally reduced by 40,000 to 100,000, but this still did not attract the intention of industry insiders to purchase in large quantities.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph continued to rise by 7 to 15 points. The prices were 28.75 for the near term, 29.25 for the long term, and 29.41 for the current spot price in Middleling. The local raw cotton trade was still good. Changzhou Dacheng and Anda factories both made purchases. In addition, flower trading was also lively, and market prices were higher than before.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market's confidence softened. At the same time, the customer's intake was slightly sluggish, and grey cloth dyeing factories were also watching and waiting. Jin dealers still needed 12-pound colored ball fine cloth, but 1036 bleached cloth and White Cat patterned cloth were out of stock, supporting the price at 2,000 yuan. Other cloth grades saw mixed ups and downs.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Market Arrivals and Sales Not Strong; Rice Prices Trending Steadily <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was affected by rain and higher prices in the interior. Arrivals were not strong, and shop purchases were acceptable. The market was firm. Flour was firm, rising 100 to 200 yuan, bran was weak, falling 100 yuan, soybean cake was flat, and the price of oil was stable, with many arrivals from Qingdao and slightly fewer from Henan. The market was active but not strong. The price was stable. Yellow soybeans were scarce in both arrivals and sales. Broad beans were stable. Wheat rose by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. According to information from the rice market, the total amount of rice arriving in the city yesterday was more than 4,000 shih, and the types and amounts were as follows: White glutinous rice 1,856 shih, Wuxi rice 455 shih, Bo Dao rice 1,418 shih, Bai Yuan rice 70 shih, Early rice 406 shih, Yin Yuan rice 90 shih, Yangxian rice 230 shih, Du Xian rice 95 shih.</p>
<h3 id="e110">China Silk Company Establishes Factories to Produce Silk; Merchants Must Register to Sell <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>In addition to producing raw silk, the China Silk Company has recently promoted the improvement of dyeing and weaving of various silk fabrics. It is understood that in February of this year, the company took over two enemy and puppet silk factories in Shanghai and established the First and Second Experimental Silk Factories. The two factories produce more than 300 pieces per month. Since its establishment, it has produced more than 1,500 pieces, including eight types of silk, such as white spun silk, striped spun silk, black crepe de chine, and brocade. They are now officially allocated for sale. To avoid merchant manipulation, merchants are registered first, and the company gives the merchants the appropriate profits. Various procedures are established in accordance with the company's business regulations. There is no requirement for the capital of the merchants. After the registration is approved, various silk products will be supplied regularly. The company's main purpose is to urge privately-run silk factories not to stick to old methods. In addition to the silk factory in Shanghai, there is also a silk spinning factory in Jiaxing. At the same time, several enemy and puppet silk factories in Shanghai have been handed over to the China Silk Company by the government for reorganization and continued resumption of work.</p>
<p>In addition, the Yanping Road and Bailinan Road Silk Factories taken over by the company have been producing more than 300 pieces of various colored silk fabrics every month since they started operation. Currently, the company has more than 1,000 pieces in stock. It started registering silk merchants from both local and foreign areas yesterday to determine the actual sales volume of each silk merchant and allocate silk accordingly. According to Sun Bohe, director of the company's business department, the price of these silk fabrics will be cheaper than the general market price when they are allocated in the future. He is currently planning to start night shifts to increase the monthly output to 500 pieces.</p>

<p>Recently, Taiwan shipping has transported large quantities of bananas and other fruits, as well as tiles. It is heard that the production cost and transportation cost of Fuliang tiles and porcelain are higher than those of Taiwan, and the transportation time is slower than that of Taiwan tiles. Therefore, part of the porcelain market will be occupied by Taiwan tiles.</p>

<p>The overseas Chinese leaders in Shanghai have offered their opinions on the government's overseas Chinese reconstruction loan program for the authorities to refer to. Combining the opinions of all parties, there are the following two points: (1) In the past, most of the loans were taken up by ordinary overseas Chinese who were not engaged in industry and commerce. Loyal and hardworking overseas Chinese have not benefited. It is deeply hoped that the loan-issuing banks will pay close attention to the review and enable loyal overseas Chinese who have been affected by the war to use the loan to rebuild their businesses and maintain their livelihoods. (2) Many overseas Chinese have now returned to their original places to prepare for rebuilding their old businesses. It is hoped that loans will be issued in a timely manner. Although the total amount of overseas Chinese loans is currently set at 50 million US dollars, the central authorities have indicated that they may increase it.</p>
<p>The China and Jiaotong Banks, which are in charge of the overseas Chinese loans, are actively preparing. Once the central authorities have negotiated the technical aspects of the loan measures, they will allocate the funds to the two banks and inform the overseas branches to start processing the loans.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market rose along with the rising gold price. The opening price of 120 Tiangiao rayon with light was 1.34 million yuan. It rose steadily, and the closing price was 1.37 million yuan. It was even better in the afternoon, with someone wanting to buy at 1.38 million yuan, and the selling price asked for 1.4 million yuan. Finally, it was called up to 1.42 million yuan, a huge increase of 100,000 yuan compared to last weekend. Various other miscellaneous goods also rose by 50,000 to 80,000 yuan. 75 Jinji semi-gloss was only 1.42 million yuan, 30,000 yuan higher than last Saturday. The same was true for factory silk, which also rose. 77-grade high-uniformity was priced at 2.275 million yuan. Dachang Foreign Company had four or five bales of transactions yesterday. The price of user silk in all grades rose by about 50,000 yuan. Actual sales were very rare. Intra-industry trading resulted in 40 to 50 dan of transactions yesterday. Silk goods were thriving, and there were many transactions. The forepart of Meiya was priced at 1.47 to 1.48 million yuan in the morning, 30,000 to 40,000 yuan higher than last weekend. Dacheng plaid was priced at 5,200 yuan, 100 yuan higher than last weekend.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Tea Market Steady as Before <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>More than two months have passed since the new tea was launched on the market. According to news from the production areas, the harvests in various places are not as good as in the past, and the quality is also old and dry. Tea farmers are also affected by the huge amount of taxes and expenses, and costs are not low. On the sales side, exports are still stagnant. Only domestic shops and customers still have a way out. Because holders are reluctant to sell lightly, prices remain firm. In addition, old goods are mostly sold domestically, and the situation remains stable.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Draw for Redemption of Four Types of Government Bonds Held at the Bankers Association Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Starting this month, the Ministry of Finance has resumed holding the government bond redemption lottery in Shanghai. The 21st redemption of the C type bonds of the 25th year Unified Government Bonds, the 8th redemption of the 27th year Relief Bonds, the 6th redemption of the 2nd issue bonds of the 30th year Construction Bonds, and the 3rd redemption of the 31st year Allied Victory Bonds were held at the Bankers Association on Hong Kong Road in the city at 9:00 AM yesterday. Eighteen bonds were drawn for the 25th year Unified Government Bonds, totaling 4.68 million yuan. Eight bonds were drawn for the 27th year Relief Bonds, totaling 240,000 yuan. Two bonds were drawn for the 2nd issue bonds of the 30th year Construction Bonds, totaling 800,000 yuan. Thirty bonds were drawn for the 31st year Allied Victory Bonds, totaling 30 million yuan. The winning numbers will be announced separately. All winning bonds and matured interest coupons, except for the 25th year Unified Government Bonds, will still be handled temporarily in accordance with the Customs Tariff Guarantee Debt Amortization Method, and the 27th year Relief Bonds will still be paid by the Chongqing Central Bank. All other bonds will be paid by the Central Bank and its authorized banks in various places on the original payment dates of each bond.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Anthracite Trading Scarce <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Due to the off-season, the market's intake is sluggish, and trading is extremely scarce. The price is hovering weakly. However, in terms of arrivals, in addition to those who have pre-booked vessel space, there are still sporadic arrivals. The excess of arrivals of anthracite and coke in Shanghai recently has not been promoted by actual sales. Supply exceeds demand in the market. Customers who transport coal to Shanghai are losing money and returning, so they have no intention of transporting it to Shanghai again for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Sugar Prices Continue to Tighten <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise due to smooth sales. The association's price for spot white sugar was 73,000 to 73,500 yuan, up more than 1,000 yuan. The company's warehouse receipts were even tighter due to the convenience of delivery. The initial price was 72,000 yuan, gradually rising to 73,250 yuan, up more than 2,000 yuan from last Saturday. No. 1 goods opened at 61,000 to 60,000 yuan, with more than 700 bags traded. Xinghua Qing traded more than 80 bags at 71,000 yuan, and Diao Qing traded dozens of bags at 56,000 yuan, all up by thousands of yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Possible US Decontrol of Penicillin Allocation <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] The heads of major penicillin allocation companies in the United States all believe that the government's control over the distribution of penicillin in the country may be lifted on July 1. Representatives of the industry will hold a meeting with the government in Washington on June 15, when the issue of canceling control may be discussed due to the sufficient supply of penicillin.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Fort Pascoe, managed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd., arrived from the United States and Australia with 8,000 tons of wheat. The ship has arrived outside Wusong Port. Because there is no reliable port in the port, it is temporarily anchored outside the port. Also, the Green Pidgeon, which arrived from the United States with a large amount of gasoline, about 3,000 tons, entered the port yesterday morning and is moored at the Texaco Wharf. Unloading will begin today. Also, the Joplip of the American Steel Company entered the port yesterday evening, also loaded with more than 1,000 tons of gasoline.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] According to the Textile Economics Bureau, US rayon production broke all previous records in January-March of this year. Total rayon and hemp production reached 212,800,000 pounds, of which rayon accounted for 169,000,000 pounds and hemp accounted for 43,700,000 pounds. This figure is 10% higher than the same period last year and 4% higher than October-December last year. Domestic rayon consumption in January-March of this year reached 164,300,000 pounds, also exceeding previous records, 12% higher than the same period last year and 5% higher than October-December last year. Rayon exports in January-March of this year were 3,300,000 pounds, 27% higher than in October-December last year, but 42% lower than the wartime export rate in early 1945.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] The American Rubber Company has recently produced another new elastic material that can be used to replace rubber in the manufacture of belts, handbags, travel bags, etc. This substitute is available in various colors and can be engraved or painted, with a lustrous finish. Other advantages are that it is not easily stained and is not affected by alcohol, sweat, grease, mildew, and most acids.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Government Bonds Redeemed! <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— (Quiet)</p>
<p>After the victory, the government resumed holding the government bond redemption lottery in Shanghai. Yesterday was the first time. There were four types of government bonds drawn. Now, taking the Unified C bonds as an example, a total of 4.68 million yuan were redeemed. (Calculated at yesterday's black market price of 3,700 yuan, this would be 17,316 million yuan.) All kinds of rumors circulating in the Shanghai bond market have been dispelled. Although there may still be people who believe that the redemption of Unified C bonds should be handled in accordance with the Customs Tariff Guarantee Method, or still have considerable hope, the national treasury is a burden on the people. Whether the government is willing to enrich the private pockets of a few capitalists with the blood and sweat of the people is something that does not require wise men to know.</p>

<p>[United Press New York Dispatch] The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that for January and February of this year, the value of goods imported by the U.S. from China was $8,360,000, while the value of goods shipped to China was $57,252,000.</p>
<p>According to customs statistics in our country, the value of American goods that have already arrived in Shanghai and been declared to customs exceeds 700 million US dollars. Other materials currently en route to China and those ordered from the US by various commercial firms in this city are not included in this figure. Calculated at the current exchange rate, this amounts to over 144 billion yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Priority Loading, 20% Discount: China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) Assists with Grain Transport, 2400 Tons of Sichuan Grain Headed East <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>In order to assist the municipal government in encouraging the purchase and transport of coarse grains, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has responded to the municipal government, stating that it will prioritize the loading and transport of grain from production areas to Shanghai and offer a 20% discount on shipping fees. The company has already notified its branch offices in various locations to implement this policy.</p>
<p>The National Shipping Allocation Committee announced that from May 22nd to June 6th, ships dispatched by the committee to transport Sichuan grain to Shanghai or Hankou totaled approximately 2,498 tons. Previously, the committee's main transportation task was to rush the transport of Japanese prisoners of war. Now that all 340,000 Japanese prisoners have been transported, with only 1,500 medical technicians remaining, the prisoner transportation work has come to an end. Subsequently, efforts will be concentrated on transporting Sichuan grain eastward. It is reported that if there are no other obstacles, 10,000 tons of Sichuan grain can be transported each month.</p>

<p>Amidst the overall decline in prices of traditional Chinese medicine and Guangzhou goods, Buddha's hand slices have surprisingly become popular again. This is due to price increases in the production areas and the arrival of summer, which has spurred sales. Consequently, there is strong demand, with prices increasing by approximately 20%.</p>

<p>[Hong Kong Dispatch] Several shipping companies here are engaged in ship sales and flag transfers (i.e., changing the nationality of ships). It is reported that the United States currently has many old ships for sale, with deadweights ranging from 1,200 to 5,600 tons and speeds of 9 to 10 nautical miles per hour. These ships were mostly built around 1916, with an average age of around 30 years. The price per ton is USD 35 to 46.</p>

<p>Timber: No significant changes, as incoming goods continue to arrive but actual sales are limited, remaining weak.</p>
<p>Seafood: New dried fungus sales are sluggish, experiencing a sharp decline. High prices and scarce sales for Hunan lotus seeds are further impacted by the influx of Raozhou lotus seeds, indicating a downward trend. Pickled mustard tubers are also weakening successively. Demand for agar-agar is exceeding supply, resulting in a decline.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabric: Price increases have reached their peak, and current demand has subsided. Lixing Palaces fell slightly by 500 yuan, and prices of other items remain flat.</p>
<p>Cotton Textiles: 6001, 8001 Double Monkey undershirts and 840, 640 Chrysanthemum undershirts are scarce on the market and are very popular. Zebra socks are selling well and rising slightly, and other products are stable.</p>
<p>Western Medicine: Saccharin is experiencing a sharp price increase due to large-scale purchases by merchants from Fujian Province. Due to the Health Bureau's ban sale message, Doulengle injection prices are decreasing due to public's fear, while prices of other items are mixed.</p>
<p>Leather: Merchants are actively purchasing textured leather, resulting in brisk sales and firm prices. Other products are unremarkable.</p>

<p>Since the start of the silkworm cocoon market in Dongting Xishan, Suzhou, a total of over 390 loads of fresh cocoons have been collected. The purchase price is 104,550 yuan per market load.</p>
<p>The current yarn and cloth market in this city is not yet a legitimate organization. In order to develop yarn and cloth sales, preparations are underway to request the government to reinstate the yarn and cloth trading market.</p>
<p>The China National Industries Association earnestly requests the authorities to change the principles for handling enemy and puppet property, returning private factories that were seized by the enemy and puppets during the occupation. All raw materials, finished products, and additions or alterations made to the factories should also be handed over to the original owners to compensate for their losses. The disposal bureau is currently carefully considering this proposal.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the banking industry, recent inland remittances from Xuzhou and Tianjin to Shanghai have been significant. Recently, large quantities of silk fabrics and paper from Shanghai and cotton yarn from Tianjin have been transported to Xuzhou and Tianjin, respectively. These two places are known for exporting large quantities of furs, but the season is still early, and prices are similar to those in Shanghai. Merchants see no profit in purchasing, so most transactions involve remittances in cash to Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e130">A Group Portrait of Fourteen Traitorous Giants Escorted from Beiping to Nanjing <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei</p>
<p>Report from our newspaper's Beiping office, dated the 25th</p>
<p>Wang Yintai: Wang Yintai is the leader of the fourteen major traitors from North China being escorted to Nanjing. On the eve of the Japanese surrender, he was still the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission. He is 58 years old, from Shanxi Province. He studied in Germany in his early years and has a German wife. He worked as a lawyer and a judge, speaks fluent Mandarin, and has a silver tongue. He is a high-profile individual. After the July 7th Incident, he served as a puppet official for eight years, holding positions such as Minister of Industry in the puppet Provisional Government, Standing Committee Member of the North China Political Affairs Commission, Superintendent of the puppet General Bureau of Industry, Chairman of the puppet North China Cooperative Enterprise Federation, Superintendent of the puppet General Bureau of Agriculture, Director of the puppet General Affairs Department, Member of the puppet National Economic Commission, and Chairman of the puppet North China Food Commune. Later, his treacherous career flourished, and he became the Chairman of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission and concurrently the President of the puppet Xinmin Association. He recruited laborers for the enemy, provided intelligence to the enemy, called on the people to donate copper and iron, and supplied the enemy with large amounts of coal, willingly serving as the enemy's hunting dog in ruling China.</p>
<p>When he was escorted from the Army Prison in Paoyuju Hutong, Beiping, he was wearing a rather smart tea-brown Western-style suit, a white shirt, a bronze-colored tie, and a pair of leather loafers made from leather shoes. When his clothes were inspected before boarding the plane, it was discovered that his belt was a white gauze bandage. He was somewhat embarrassed.</p>
<p>When a reporter asked him what his thoughts were, he initially refused to answer. Later, he cunningly said, "I have nothing to say. The people of North China will know everything about me, and I believe that the government's judgment will be fair."</p>
<p>At the gate of the Army Prison, just before the car was about to leave, he smiled bitterly at the reporter and said, "Farewell, Beiping. I'm afraid I won't be able to return." As the truck passed Dengshikou, his German wife and three daughters were watching him and weeping in the crowd of people pointing and cursing the traitors.</p>
<p>Qi Xieyuan: Qi Xieyuan can be considered the most senior warlord among this group of major traitors. Before the July 7th Incident, this general, who had "retired in Tianjin," was already flirting with the Japanese intelligence agencies. After the July 7th Incident, he organized the puppet Provisional Government with Wang Kemin and others, serving as a standing committee member and the Director-General of the Security Department. Subsequently, he served as the president of the puppet military academy, the superintendent of the puppet General Security Department, the commander-in-chief of the puppet Security Army, and a standing committee member of the puppet Military Commission. During his tenure as a puppet official, he repeatedly recruited puppet Security Army soldiers, forming eleven group armies stationed throughout North China, disrupting the War of Resistance and arresting and killing many underground workers of the Central Government.</p>
<p>He is 62 years old this year and is the tallest among these traitors. He is bald, wearing a black satin hat, a black mandarin jacket, a light gray lined robe, and satin shoes. This old fellow's face is red, and a smile constantly floats on his thick skin. However, when someone asked him about his feelings about the escort, he became agitated and patted his chest, saying, "I have not wronged the common people. This time, I will definitely listen to the sanctions of the national law!" Then, as if comforting and self-deprecating, he said to Liu Yushu, the puppet mayor of Beijing, who was handcuffed to him, "Mayor, you have not wronged the people either." A set of self-deceiving nonsense.</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng: Yin Rugeng is an "advanced" traitor. Eleven years ago, in November of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1935], he took advantage of Japan's attempt to invade North China and openly seized 22 counties in eastern Hebei, establishing the so-called "East Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Government." He accepted Japanese command, forcing people to sell the Liujiang Coal Mine, establishing the East Hebei Bank, and protecting Japanese and Korean ruffians who smuggled silver exports. After the Tongzhou Incident, he secretly signed three major conditions with Japan: (1) Do not announce the truth about the Tongzhou Incident, (2) Do not engage in political activities, and (3) Report all activities to the Japanese military police at any time. After the "East Hebei Government" collapsed, in the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1943], he responded to Wang Jingwei's invitation and served as a special commissioner of the National Economic Commission. He is an old-brand traitor.</p>
<p>He is 57 years old this year and looks old, completely different from how he looked in the East Hebei era. He is wearing a large blue cloth coat and a black satin vest. When a reporter asked him what his thoughts were, he just smiled and said, "Nothing to say, nothing to say." He pretended to be calm but constantly took off his hat and wiped his sweat with a handkerchief. He carried Lao Tzu and Zhuang Tzu's books and the "Book of Great Exaltation."</p>
<p>Wang Shijing: Wang Shijing was the superintendent of the Finance Department of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission. He is the most handsome and extravagant figure in this group. He wears a light-colored woolen lined robe, floral striped woolen dress pants, yellow thin-soled leather shoes, a taupe-colored top hat, and carries a small leather bag. He wears white rings on both hands. During the inspection at the airport, it was discovered that his handbag contained the most complete items: various tonics, powder, soap, a fan, and a small, tightly wrapped package. When opened, it was a roll of confessions, and a large, meticulously mounted hardcover xuan paper notebook, probably for writing confessions.</p>
<p>His identity is difficult to understand. According to those in charge, he was indeed involved in "underground work." His family had a radio station for contacting the Central Government, so the authorities were relatively polite to him. For the past six months, he and Yu Jinhe had been under house arrest and did not enter the Army Prison until 25 minutes before the escort, when they were taken to the Army Prison in a small car. However, he is not without sin, such as issuing counterfeit currency and disrupting the financial system.</p>
<p>When the reporter asked him questions, he feigned deafness and dumbness, with Yu Jinhe serving as his translator. Yu Jinhe put his hand to his mouth in a trumpet shape and aimed at Wang's ear, "This gentleman is asking you if you have anything else to say?" He smiled shamefully, "Nothing, nothing, thank you, I am just ashamed, I should be, I should be."</p>
<p>Yu Jinhe: Yu Jinhe served as the mayor of Beijing, a member of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, and the chairman of the puppet Cooperative Enterprise Federation. During his five years in puppet positions, he emphasized frugality and increased production, obeyed the enemy's orders, strengthened enslavement education, issued residence permits, and captured and killed anti-Japanese personnel.</p>
<p>He is 58 years old this year, wearing a felt hat, a gray silk robe, and coarse cloth shoes. He speaks very elegantly, "In Beiping, I have not wronged the people." "It is right for the state to punish traitors and rectify discipline, but it seems that we should also consider our circumstances." He also said, "This time I was not clear-headed, I will die without regret." On the prison truck, he looked around. He saw many of his former subordinates before the incident (he was the police chief of Peiping before the incident) who had participated in the War of Resistance and returned to Beiping, some even serving as escorts. He talked to an old acquaintance, and his eyes were already moist.</p>
<p>Jiang Kanghu: Jiang Kanghu, who opposed vernacular Chinese in his early years, returned from the United States in the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939] and lived in Hong Kong. Soon after, he heeded Wang Jingwei's encouragement and participated in the "Peaceful National Construction Movement." He subsequently served as the vice president and president of the puppet Examination Yuan, and a member of the puppet National Government. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was arrested in Beiping on December 5th of last year. In prison, he showed off a bit, saying that when the Japanese strictly controlled food, he had advocated protesting in the puppet National Government. He had also requested serious consideration when declaring war on Britain and the United States, but unfortunately, none of these had any effect.</p>
<p>This 64-year-old fellow looked old and frail when leaving the Army Prison, his face pale, as if he were very frightened. He wore black-rimmed glasses, a black felt top hat, and a gray cloth lined robe. He didn't look like a student who had stayed in the United States at all. He did not answer the reporter's questions, but in his heart, he seemed to be trying to suppress his uneasy emotions.</p>
<p>Zhou Zuoren: After the fall of Beiping, the old scholar suddenly grew impatient with the loneliness of Kuyuzhai and enthusiastically became a puppet official. He served as the president of the puppet Peking University and a standing committee member and superintendent of the Education Department of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission. After the victory, national law brought him from Kuyuzhai to "Bitter Prison Studio," to taste the flavor of iron bars.</p>
<p>The old scholar Zhou is as thin as a monkey, bald, wearing yellow-rimmed glasses, and wearing a gray-yellow lined robe, with a desolate look. He said, "After the victory, I sat at home waiting for the sanctions of the state. I have no feelings now." His voice was very low, with a bitter smile. Before being arrested, he argued to reporters in Kuyuzhai that his reason for becoming an official and president was to educate young people in the occupied areas for the country and to preserve the country's vitality. He had negotiated with the Japanese several times, telling them not to force students to participate in rallies all day long, so as not to waste their studies.</p>
<p>Among this group of major traitors from North China being escorted to Nanjing, he is the lightest in weight, only 52 kilograms. Compared to Tang Yangdu, the puppet governor of Shandong Province, who weighs 90 kilograms, he is almost half the weight. Although he served as a puppet official for several years, he is the poorest compared to other traitors. It is said that his family members visit him in prison every month, bringing him only a little more than ten thousand yuan for spending money. Compared to Zou Quansun, whose family sends one or two hundred thousand yuan at a time, he is far behind. His luggage for this escort to Nanjing is also the simplest, a small bundle weighing less than ten pounds, containing two books: one is his own "Collected Essays on Dragons," and the other is "Zhu Xi's Family Instructions."</p>
<p>Pan Yugui: Pan Yugui is the criminal who colluded with the "Tiger of Malaya" - Yamashita Tomoyuki to station troops in Beiping after the July 7th Incident. At that time, he was responsible for hosting the Maintenance Committee, using the excuse of maintaining public order to intimidate the National Army and party and government personnel, setting a deadline for them to leave Beiping, and leading enemy troops to station in the city. He also burned the Premier's legacy and various books related to party ideology in private collections. Later, as the mayor of Tianjin, he completely obeyed the enemy's commands.</p>
<p>In the Army Prison, he once argued that when he was the police chief of Beijing, he had used his body to block the cannon muzzle when the enemy was bombarding the city, preventing the bombardment and protecting the lives and property of the Central Party, government, and military personnel and citizens. During his tenure as the puppet mayor of Tianjin, he never set up a "Higher Special Agent Section" to avoid harming the citizens. As the chairman of the North China Reclamation Company, he had negotiated with the Japanese and obtained 2,000 bags of food, none of which were acts of benefiting the enemy and betraying the country.</p>
<p>This traitor, nicknamed "Traitor Cao Cao," is 64 years old this year, with a white beard and a green complexion. In his suitcase, in addition to pastries, there are all tonics. It is said that his heart disease is quite severe. He did not respond to the reporter's questions.</p>
<p>Zou Quansun: Zou Quansun was the president of the Beiping Chamber of Commerce during the occupation, manipulating finance, manipulating prices, and committing all kinds of evil. After the victory, he was one of the most active traitors, using the ill-gotten wealth he had plundered from the people over the years to bribe officials and seek leniency everywhere. Unfortunately, his crimes were too great to be covered up by money.</p>
<p>He is 44 years old this year, from Fushan, Shandong Province, wearing a gray cloth long gown, obviously trying to appear poor. He said to the reporter, "I think I will be very natural, because..." He laughed loudly, his mouth full of gold teeth, wide open.</p>
<p>Now let me write down his important resume: Chairman of the puppet North China Chamber of Commerce Federation and the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, Director of the North China Headquarters of the East Asia Economic Roundtable, Member of the North China Political Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>Liu Yushu: Liu Yushu served as the puppet mayor of Beijing and a member of the North China Political Affairs Commission. He is from Suining, Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>A small old man of 63 years old, but looks only like he is in his forties, wearing a light blue thin cotton robe. On the way from the Army Prison to Nanyuan Airport, he made a lot of noise on the large truck where fourteen people were sitting together, something he was not used to. He replied to the reporter's inquiry, "I have nothing to say. The crimes I have committed are not open to appeal, and my life will be judged by the people of Beijing." Another reporter, also from Beijing, then asked him, "Do you remember feeding the people of Beijing mixed flour?" He blushed and said nothing.</p>
<p>Tang Yangdu: Tang Yangdu served as the puppet governor of Shandong Province, as well as a standing committee member of the North China Political Affairs Commission and the Superintendent of the Public Works Department. He is from Zou County, Shandong Province, 57 years old this year, and tall. He can be described as the "donkey in the sheep herd" among the traitors. He wears a long robe and mandarin jacket, and the beard hanging down his chest is completely white. Some people say that he has the air of a Greek scholar, but he is a thorough old traitor.</p>
<p>He still wants to live, shamelessly using his children as a shield: "My elder brother is also resisting the war in the mainland, and my eldest son died for the resistance in Kunming, and my second son died for the resistance in Chongqing. As for myself, I am old and decrepit and will die. It doesn't matter, I have been preparing for it for a long time. Before you started arresting us, I voluntarily surrendered to the headquarters. Please give me a fair trial."</p>
<p>Chen Zengi: Chen Zengi served as the governor of Hebei Province, as well as a standing committee member of the North China Political Affairs Commission and the Superintendent of the Agricultural Affairs Department. He is 63 years old this year, from Qingxian, Hebei Province. He wears a light blue sherwani coat and satin shoes. He is plump all over. After arriving at the airport, he said, "It's almost over. I'm going to take another flight." Wang Shijing glared at him, as if saying, "You're so insensitive!"</p>
<p>Wen Yuanmo and Wang Mo</p>
<p>Among this group of major traitors from North China being escorted to Nanjing, there are three cultural traitors. In addition to Zhou Zuoren, there are also two devils—Wen Yuanmo and Wang Mo. They both served as standing committee members and superintendents of the Education Department of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>Wen Yuanmo is a well-known physics professor. He unfortunately lost his integrity when he took office as the superintendent of the puppet Education Department in April of last year. He said that he was a poor teacher and that the money he was taking to Nanjing was also very meager.</p>
<p>Wang Mo studies geology. The World Geography published by the World Book Company, which is quite famous, was written by him. He served as a puppet superintendent during the occupation. That day, he was wearing a gray cloth shirt and looked extremely embarrassed.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Visiting the World's Smallest Republic: San Marino <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>By Xue Tong, from Rome, May</p>
<p>Although Italy is a boot-shaped peninsula in the Mediterranean Sea, it encompasses two independent nations within its small territory: the Vatican Papal State in Rome and the world's smallest republic, San Marino, located approximately 400 kilometers north of Rome. The former is more widely known, while the latter receives less attention due to its remote location. Taking advantage of the Spring Festival holiday, I drove north from Rome for a day trip and now record my experiences.</p>
<p>(1) Sightseeing Along the Way</p>
<p>The Italian region that suffered the most war damage was Rimini, located in central Italy along the Adriatic coast. Rimini marked the end of the German Gothic Line, the other end being Florence. British and German forces fought fiercely here, advancing and retreating repeatedly for 25 days. Consequently, nine out of ten houses in Rimini were destroyed. The Republic of San Marino is located 23 kilometers northwest of the much-feared Rimini. To its north was the German defense line, and to its south the British positions, truly in the midst of crossfire—one can imagine the constant fright they endured. I first paid my respects to Rimini, where the ruins and debris reflected in the clear, beautiful blue sea resembled a dead city, filling my heart with sorrow. Then, I drove towards San Marino. Two rows of peach and bamboo trees lined the road, their vibrant colors intense and radiant, exceptionally fresh and beautiful. As the car approached the villages, a fresh breeze greeted us, filling us with a sense of longing. The terrain became increasingly elevated, and the capital of San Marino was located on Mount Titano, a majestic and towering peak. The sound of the car startled the village girls working in the fields, who, draped in light veils, leaned against their huts and smiled, signaling their welcome. Apparently, few tourists had visited since the war, and I was likely the first Chinese national to visit this country after the war. Upon reaching the border, there was a small bridge about two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters) long. Beside the bridge stood a horizontal plaque with the inscription "Republic of San Marino." The bridge had just been repaired. Upon inquiry, I was told that San Marino had maintained neutrality throughout the war, but the bridge was the only international transportation route, so it had to be destroyed to ensure national defense. Having booked a hotel by phone the day before, I was greeted outside the city by a hotel attendant who guided me to the capital. The hotel was named "Titano," after the mountain. It was clean and well-arranged, and the prices were reasonable, aimed at attracting tourists.</p>
<p>(2) A Brief History of the Founding of the Nation</p>
<p>After a brief rest, I visited the government. Due to the Spring Festival holiday, I was unable to meet with the main administrative officials. I only met with the Secretary of the Interior Ministry, who kindly received me and accompanied me on a tour of the entire country. According to him, the entire national territory is 61 kilometers long, with a population of 16,000, including one capital city (population 2,000) and eight rural towns. The country's founding dates back to 301 AD, by an Arab priest named Saint Marinus. It initially began as a religious collective, and in 542 AD, it formed into an independent state. In 1600 AD, the constitution was formally promulgated, establishing a republican system of government. I asked how such a small place had been able to survive to this day, unaffected by global changes. He replied that in the Middle Ages, when military equipment was not sophisticated, San Marino was located on Mount Titano, commanding a high vantage point and having a strategic location. In addition, the people were martial and skilled in battle, so it was repeatedly invaded but never conquered. In 1807, Napoleon I occupied Italy and wanted to gift the nearby cities of Rimini and Cesena to San Marino, but the San Marino authorities refused, for which the Italians are still grateful to this day. In 1849, during the Italian unification movement, General Garibaldi sought refuge in San Marino for two days, narrowly escaping with his life, for which the Italians also felt indebted. During this war, San Marino took in 10,000 Italian refugees, saving lives, which almost led to a severe food shortage nationwide. However, from now on, the Italians will not forget the benefits they received and will provide support in various ways. Therefore, its national spirit can be symbolized by its flag, which is white and blue. White represents peace, and blue represents freedom. It features a national emblem in the middle, with a laurel branch on one side, representing honor, and a cypress branch on the other, representing military strength. Below is the Latin word "Libertas" (Freedom), above which is a crown, representing "sovereignty." Above the crown is a cross, representing universal love. Therefore, its national spirit can be summarized as "Peace, Freedom, Sovereignty, and Universal Love." During World War I, it declared war on Austria-Hungary out of a sense of justice. However, it was forgotten at the Paris Peace Conference and did not sign the treaty. During this war, it remained neutral throughout. Initially, the German commander in Italy, Kesselring, promised not to invade. However, in the last two months, the desperate German forces crossed the bridge and broke neutrality, entering its territory. Thus, part of the national territory became a battlefield. However, the capital was never invaded by any side. The most significant war damage was caused by the American bombing on June 26, 1944, which resulted in 60 deaths and injuries. After protesting to the United States, the U.S. acknowledged it as an unfortunate accident due to a miscalculation. The current government is rushing to complete three statistics: (1) War damage caused by the German army; (2) War damage caused by the British and American Allied forces; (3) Losses caused by the overall war impact. The second item is particularly important because it requires submitting a request for compensation to Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>(3) Government Organization</p>
<p>The Republic of San Marino has territory, people, and sovereignty, so it is recognized by the international community as an independent country. In addition to the constitution, it also has civil and criminal laws and regulations. The government organization is a three-branch system of executive, judicial, and legislative powers. It has two presidents, one elected by the residents of the capital and one elected by the residents of the towns. They are required to hold citizen reception hours from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM every Wednesday, where citizens can directly present their difficulties. The parliament is organized by sixty popularly elected parliamentarians, forming the highest legislative body. The judiciary is a three-level, three-trial system. There is also a State Council, composed of ten members elected by the parliament, serving as the highest executive body. Under the President, there is a Minister of Foreign Affairs, who oversees foreign affairs and internal affairs, as well as a Minister and Deputy Minister of Finance, who oversee internal affairs and finance. There are a total of 22 staff members. There are also ten bureaus, smaller in scale than ministries, for health, transportation, education, sports, public works, public drama, architecture, publishing, post office, and labor. Before the war, there was only one Fascist party in the country. Now, due to current trends, there are also three major political parties: the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Democratic Alliance. The first two are left-leaning, and the latter is right-leaning. The current two presidents, the one elected by the capital is from the Socialist Party, and the one elected by the towns is from the Communist Party. The term of office for both the presidents and the parliamentarians is half a year (the president is the ex officio speaker of the parliament), and elections are held every April 1 and October 1. Currently, out of the 60 parliamentarians, 40 are from the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, and the remaining 20 are from the Democratic Alliance (the ten members of the State Council are allocated by each party according to this proportion). Therefore, the country is currently ruled by the left-leaning parties. Former Fascist party officials have now been arrested and imprisoned for trial. In terms of international relations, it has ambassadors stationed in France and the Vatican. It has established consulates with Italy, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, France, and other countries. It has also participated in the International Agricultural Association (established in 1905, China is also a member), the Universal Postal Union, the International Red Cross, the International Radio Conference, the Paris Motor Traffic Conference, the Hague International Permanent Court, and others.</p>
<p>(4) Finance and Economy</p>
<p>The main source of national finance is the issuance of stamps. The country has been issuing stamps since 1877, and their beautiful designs are treasured by stamp collectors worldwide. In addition, it relies on tax revenue subsidies from the Italian government. San Marino is primarily an agricultural country, only producing wheat and wine. It produces 15,000 dan (approximately 750 tons) of wheat annually, and after consuming 12,000 dan themselves, it can export 3,000 dan annually. However, all daily necessities must be imported. To facilitate the import of Italian goods, it has an agreement with Italy that it does not set up customs checkpoints to levy taxes and does not issue paper currency but uses Italian currency. In return, the Italian government pays 25 million lire annually to subsidize its tax revenue. The last agreement was made in 1939, and it was recently revised once by Italian Prime Minister Gasperi. The main revision stipulates that San Marino cannot handle divorce procedures in the future. Because Italy is a Catholic country, according to Catholic doctrine, spouses cannot divorce unless specially approved by the Pope. Therefore, Italians seeking divorce go to San Marino to complete divorce procedures. The current Italian Prime Minister Gasperi is the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, and to remedy this situation, he made this amendment to stop the outflow of currency.</p>
<p>The country has 23 kilometers of highways and 32 kilometers of railways (with 16 tunnels), which are narrow-gauge railways with electric locomotives. They were donated by Mussolini in 1932, with a value of 48 million lire at the time (approximately 240,000 US dollars). After the outbreak of the war, they were destroyed by the Fascist party. Currently, it plans to issue public bonds to raise funds for repairs. The government owns 42 cars, one of which was used by the former president. The two current presidents each use one. Recently, one car was damaged and being repaired, so the two presidents shared one car. The Transportation Bureau issues approximately 400 R.S.M. (Republic of San Marino abbreviation) license plates, which are valid in all countries worldwide. Because the annual license plate tax is only 1,000 lire (approximately 4 US dollars), which is cheaper than in Italy, many Italians nearby apply for licenses in San Marino.</p>
<p>(5) National Life</p>
<p>There is no military service or taxation in the country. There are only 300 volunteer soldiers and 12 military police, who are borrowed from the Italian government. The president's honorary honor guard of 32 people is an honorary position held by nobles. Therefore, the economic burden on citizens is extremely light, but it is extremely difficult to obtain its citizenship. Ordinary entry is limited to three days. Beyond three days, it must be reported to the government for approval. According to law, those who apply for citizenship are limited to those born within San Marino who are 21 years old. However, few are approved. But recently, the left-leaning government has slightly relaxed the nationality law, stating that anyone who has lived in San Marino for 40 years can apply for citizenship. After this happens, about 300 people will qualify for citizenship, and the left-leaning parties will therefore gain 300 more votes. It can be seen that even such a small country as San Marino cannot avoid the overwhelming trend of the modern world. The country awards honorary citizenship to those who have contributed to humanity and the country. Mussolini was awarded honorary citizenship for donating 32 kilometers of railways, and Marconi was awarded honorary citizenship for inventing radio. Recently, the parliament is discussing awarding honorary citizenship to former U.S. President Roosevelt, which will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Because the whole country lives and works in peace, the public order is extremely good, with a prevalence of not picking up lost items and not locking doors at night. The entire country has only nine prisoners, four of whom are Fascist political prisoners, and the other five are thieves. All must be stripped of their citizenship and deported after serving their sentences. National compulsory education is implemented nationwide, with primary school lasting five years and eight schools (one in each town), junior high school lasting five years and one school, and senior high school lasting three years, all located in the capital. There is also an orphanage with 28 orphans, which I visited for a week. It was neatly arranged and quite large in scale. In addition, there is a modern hospital (with 150 beds), three cinemas, and one theater, all run by the state. The architecture is magnificent, and the facilities are excellent. There are three newspapers nationwide. One is the "Titano Bi-Monthly," hosted by the Socialist Party, with a circulation of 2,000 copies per issue, the most widely circulated. The second is the "Great Bell Monthly," hosted by the Democratic Alliance, and the third is the "Mars Bi-Monthly," hosted by the Communist Party. Recently, the Democratic Alliance criticized the government in the "Great Bell Monthly" for lacking a thorough plan for issuing stamps, and it believes that the government overdrafted the budget by 2 million lire (approximately 7,000 US dollars) without legal procedures, which is illegal and improper. However, the government stated that government finances have been greatly affected by the depreciation of the lira in recent years. Recently, it plans to hire financial experts in Rome to study taxation methods to inject capital. It can be seen that the devastation of this war is so deep that even a small country like San Marino is affected by it. The so-called paradise on earth is no longer to be found anywhere. The national capital is located on the mountain peak, overlooking the entire territory. The mountain peak is extremely high, and a bell tower is built. There is one large bell and one small bell. The large bell tells the hour, and the small bell tells the quarter hour. The sound of the bell can be heard throughout the country, so people do not need to wear watches. After staying overnight, I quietly departed in the faint morning light amid the melodious sounds of the bells!</p>
<h3 id="e132">Sunday Forum: The Problem of Atomic Bomb Defense <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Zengjue</p>
<p>—Fifth Discussion on the Atomic Bomb Problem—</p>
<p>1.  The Power of the Atomic Bomb</p>
<p>Although atomic bombs have only been formally used twice, the actual manifestation of their power has shocked the world! A single atomic bomb can destroy a large city, making all other weapons pale in comparison. This leap forward surpasses mankind's improvements in weaponry over the past several hundred years. It is not only unprecedentedly destructive, but its radioactivity can persist for a considerable period, causing animals to develop internal changes and die unknowingly without apparent external injuries. It has been nine months since the atomic bombs fell on Japan, and Japanese hospitals still have many people being treated for invisible wounds, which is clear evidence. According to recent reports, the latest American atomic bomb is over a thousand times more powerful than the ones dropped on Japan, with a destructive force equivalent to a million ordinary ten-ton bombs. Its power is still being researched and expanded. The test scheduled by the United States to be held on Bikini Atoll on July 1 has the potential to destroy an entire fleet in one fell swoop. From the invention of the atomic bomb to today, only a year has passed. It is reported that, under the efforts of American scientists, the production raw materials have increased sixfold, and the manufacturing cost has been reduced by half. Within a few years, any country with a scientific and industrial foundation can also imitate it. Without appropriate controls, mankind's calamity is just beginning, and the end of the world may not be far away!</p>
<p>In addition to material destruction, there is also psychological threat. In the event of a conflict, any hostile country's location is likely to be hit by an atomic bomb. People who sleep soundly tonight do not know if they will still exist in the world tomorrow. This feeling of uneasiness can completely paralyze a country's institutions, so how can we talk about "freedom from fear"!</p>
<p>2.  Active Defense</p>
<p>The only active defense is to repel enemy planes carrying atomic bombs and prevent them from flying over our country. The advancement of radar can accurately measure the arrival of enemy planes, allowing our powerful air force to intercept them outside our borders. However, the sky is so vast that it is impossible to prevent any enemy plane from sneaking into our country's airspace. Any intrusion by an enemy plane can determine our country's fate. At the beginning of the European theater in World War II, Hitler of Germany boasted that he would not allow an enemy plane to enter German airspace, but what was the reality? Except for a short period, Allied planes were almost always present in German airspace. All those who study air defense have not yet discovered an effective method of active air defense. Perhaps one day in the future, the aircraft of warring nations will take off simultaneously, and by the time they complete their missions and return to their countries, they will each discover that their important cities have been destroyed!</p>
<p>Moreover, missiles (i.e., guided missiles) or unmanned aircraft are constantly being improved, making it easy to accurately attack enemy targets with radio control. In the future, they will inevitably use planes carrying atomic bombs, in high-altitude and high-speed formations, to attack the other side in groups of hundreds or thousands. At that time, it will be impossible to defend. The only effective solution is for the entire country to strive to research science and develop industry, so that our country can also manufacture its own atomic bombs and missiles and other new weapons, so that the enemy is afraid of our retaliatory measures and dare not easily use atomic bombs. For example, poison gas was not tried by the Axis powers in World War II. This is because the Allied powers could also produce poison gas, and the Axis powers had concerns and dared not use it easily. This proves that "an eye for an eye" is indeed the most proactive and effective method of preventing atomic bombs.</p>
<p>3.  Passive Defense</p>
<p>What about passive defense? The only way is to disperse as much as possible to reduce the potential for damage. The entire country can be divided into several self-sufficient regions, and each city should preferably not have an excessive population. Cities with hundreds of thousands of people or more should be divided into several central areas, each with sufficient self-sufficiency in industry, commerce, water, and electricity. Cities with large populations, such as Shanghai, should be divided into at least three or five central areas, with gaps between each central area based on the range of each atomic bomb's destructive power. If there are natural mountain barriers, they should be used as intervals between the areas.</p>
<p>Based on the experience of World War II, more people died from burns than from shrapnel. The firestorm caused by bombs can engulf people and cities at a speed of ninety miles per hour. In addition to being directly burned to death by the flames, many people also died due to lack of oxygen or exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning. Therefore, some people advocate that air defense buildings should be built on five- to seven-story buildings to reduce the invasion of flames and have heat protection and ventilation equipment. However, it is doubtful whether ordinary buildings can withstand the explosive force of atomic bombs, and the high heat of atomic bombs is far beyond that of ordinary incendiary bombs. Therefore, if there is sufficient oxygen storage in underground facilities, it is undoubtedly the most effective method of defending against bombs. Important factories should be built underground, and perhaps in the future all important buildings—factories, warehouses, and transportation facilities—will be hidden hundreds of feet underground.</p>
<p>In addition to the thousands of times greater destructive force and high heat of atomic bombs compared to ordinary bombs or incendiary bombs, they also have their unique radioactive destructive power. Future buildings must have equipment to defend against radioactivity.</p>
<p>4.  Conclusion</p>
<p>The active and passive defenses mentioned above are not absolutely effective methods. Some people still believe that for every offensive weapon, there will be a corresponding defensive weapon. But in the atomic age, I am afraid that there is no weapon in the world that can overcome the atomic bomb. The only safe and effective way is to permanently eliminate the suspicions and hatred that lead to war, and it is best to eliminate all national, ethnic, religious, and belief boundaries and form a world government, with atomic energy controlled by the world government. Then people can forget the word "war" and no longer engage in killing. All enlightened people believe that this ideal is urgent. U.S. President Wilson had already cried out loudly thirty years ago. Unfortunately, the suspicions between countries are not easy to eliminate, and the League of Nations is weak and ineffective, existing in name only, ultimately leading to the outbreak of World War II. Although the war is over now, no one can say for sure whether the United Nations organization is much stronger than the League of Nations. However, in the atomic age today, mankind has reached a crossroads of destruction and happiness, and it is no longer just talking about ideals, but seeking how to realize them without further delay. It can be said that the promotion of mankind's "self-awareness" is also the highest achievement of social science.</p>
<p>According to the current situation, optimism is not allowed. A sense of narrow security based on nationality and country is still deeply rooted in the minds of people in various countries, and the shadow of aggression still extends to every corner of the world. Humans are truly strange animals, experiencing pain but still wanting to experience pain, creating civilization but still wanting to destroy civilization! Therefore, our people should not rely solely on the United Nations organization to an excessive degree without any preparation, and we cannot ignore "reality" based solely on "ideals." We must quickly unite and work together to promote the science and industry that should be researched and built in the atomic age to protect the safety of the country and the nation. The current atomic bomb uses "uranium" as its main raw material, which is extracted from carnotite or pitchblende. The main production areas of these two minerals are currently Africa, the Belgian Congo, Denver in the United States, Silesia in Germany, the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union, and Guangxi and southern Jiangxi in our country. If our country researches and manufactures atomic bombs, there is no need to worry about a shortage of raw materials. Only if we can manufacture atomic bombs can we prevent others from threatening us with atomic bombs.</p>
<p>Britain is a country that is purely advanced in science, and she also participated in leading the invention of the atomic bomb. But being mindful of danger in times of peace, it has not relaxed its preparations for protecting the safety of the British Empire. This time, mobilizing scientists across the country to engage in scientific research is nothing more than targeting the manufacture of atomic bombs and atomic bomb defense. Considering this, it is not difficult for the people of our country to choose which way we should go. We believe that only nationwide sincere cooperation and efforts in scientific research and industrial construction is the only way to achieve national security!</p>

<h3 id="e134">Loan Sharks Exploiting Rice Scarcity! <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: Post-victory Shanghai is a place where almost every family lacks rice and grain. Only those engaged in large-scale business and the wealthy are using their intellect and skill to enrich themselves, creating a stark contrast to the common people who toil diligently with pale faces. Now, they are exploiting the rice shortage by lending rice at exorbitant interest rates: for every 160 catties of rice lent, 240 catties of rice (including principal and interest) must be repaid after the autumn harvest. Such high interest for a mere three months! The common people are unwilling to bear such a burden, but hunger forces them to borrow. The common people are being forced to yield to the pressures of life! For example, a commoner who cultivates ten acres of land, with a family of five, might need to borrow 200 catties of rice this year. If the harvest is good, each acre might yield 200 catties of rice, giving them 2000 catties in total. After repaying the 300 catties (principal and interest), they would have 1700 catties left. The five people in the family would need at least 1500 catties of rice for the year. This leaves only 200 catties, and that does not include miscellaneous expenses. These 200 catties can only be used to buy some fertilizer, so they will still be short on expenses. How will they ever be able to repay their debts? If things continue like this, I fear the bankruptcy of the rural areas is not far off! I am a poor teacher, earning just over 20,000 (currency unspecified) a month, but even that is often in arrears. The county government is said to be short of money. That meager amount can only buy 60 catties of rice, which is hardly enough for one person's sustenance, let alone supporting a family. Therefore, I have had to endure the suffering of borrowing with heavy interest, as described above! So this is what they mean by the "rich and abundant region of Jiangnan!" Respectfully submitted by Wu Xiangshan, teacher at Hexi National Primary School, Shanghai County.</p>

<p>Dear Editor: Readers often have no way to express their opinions on political and social issues. Although your newspaper has a "Reader Opinions" section, it is too small, and many submissions are verbose. I propose several ideas. After gaining public agreement, please allocate a larger space so that readers have a place to speak and voice their grievances. The following are my suggestions: (1) Suggestions or discussions on the merits and demerits of local (or regional) political facilities should be allowed to help alleviate suffering. (2) Verifiable complaints of unreasonable bullying or extortion should be reported. (3) Information related to social disorder and cases threatening the lives of residents should be exposed as much as possible to attract public scrutiny. (4) Submissions must be based on facts, with authentic signatures and no false accusations or personal attacks. (5) The language must be concise, avoiding lengthy and redundant prose, to prevent depriving others of the space to express their views. (6) This column aims to raise the voices of the people, strengthen the sanction of public opinion, and express genuine public sentiment.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Tiger Hill Flower Farmers Petition for Tax Exemption <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: Respected Sir, in the Tiger Hill area of Wu County, approximately one thousand households, large and small, make a living by growing camellias. They are normally diligent and thrifty, working hard to make a living. These camellias, including bitter oranges, jasmine, and white orchids, are agricultural products and are therefore exempt from taxes. However, since the start of the Anti-Japanese War, during the eight years of occupation, the people have suffered under the enemy's tyranny, subjected to seizure and plunder. The harm to flower farmers has been especially severe. As late as October of the thirty-second year of the Republic, a person named Gu Shunhua, abusing the enemy's power, attempted to extort the villagers and destroy the rural economy by creating a special camellia tax. As the flower business is agricultural and exempt from taxation, flower farmers rose in protest. Fearing unrest and unable to defy public opinion, the puppet government pretended to care about the flower farmers and ordered the tax abolished. Then, in the spring of the thirty-third year of the Republic, Japanese businessmen Oyama Mitsuhiro and Matsumoto Okio came to the area and founded the Dahua Foreign Firm, oppressing the flower farmers and attempting to control the industry. The flower farmers initially resisted, leading the Japanese Matsumoto Okio to beat the flower farmer Wang Jufu. Because Mr. Wang was old and weak, he lost too much blood and died despite medical treatment. This is a fact showing the loyalty of our Tiger Hill flower farmers to the region and to the government, worthy of praise and tears. For eight long years, we lived in dire circumstances, awaiting the light. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, everyone is celebrating with joy. But suddenly, on May 29th, we saw in Suzhou newspapers that the Wu County Council meeting included a proposal from the county government to levy a special camellia tax, which had already been approved by the provincial government. The flower farmers were terrified. Our flower business suffered greatly during the enemy occupation. Now that the rural economy is on the verge of collapse, we urgently need the government to provide assistance, increase production, and restore our former business. We were very hopeful. Moreover, according to Suzhou newspapers on April 11th, the Ministry of Finance has strictly prohibited local governments at all levels from levying taxes on goods, as the regulations are incompatible. Furthermore, agricultural products have never been included in standard taxation. In addition to submitting a petition to the authorities requesting exemption from this harsh camellia tax, we are specifically appealing to all sectors of society to uphold justice and provide assistance. We are sincerely grateful. Sincerely, all the flower farmers of Tiger Hill, Wu County.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Understanding <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>A person has an inner pain that cannot be represented by superficial smiles. You see that a person is outwardly happy and joyful; if you think that they are truly happy and joyful, then you are mistaken, because you have not penetrated the inner layer of that person's life.</p>
<p>The Russian literary giant Tolstoy died in a foreign land. His last words were: "Water in a bucket, too full, too full, too full, it will overflow." The bucket cannot act as a barrier.</p>
<p>This is the last sigh of a soul, and the most painful cry of human nature. Because, because of the one person in the world he loved most, he understood that he had despaired of her; she could not understand him. He left, at the age of seventy, and died in a foreign land. However, his great and brilliant achievements in the world, even in the centuries before and after, cannot compensate for the tragedy he personally experienced.</p>
<p>Understanding a person is not an easy thing!</p>
<p>As in the example above, even after decades of marriage, it is not possible. How can one say it is possible for an ordinary friend?</p>
<h3 id="e138">Go to Changshu <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Zuo Han</p>
<p>Perhaps I am not yet qualified to describe Changshu, because I have only been there for a few days. I have not yet familiarized myself with the roads, so how can I write an impression piece?</p>
<p>However, precisely because I am unfamiliar, I can still write something. Once I become familiar, I will be assimilated, and I will see black as white, and there will be nothing to say.</p>
<p>I remember when I first went to Wujiang, I felt that Wujiang had two characteristics: many crows and few beggars. However, the old residents of Wujiang would never think about this, let alone be surprised by it. Just as those who live in Suzhou spend their days crowded in Guanqian, sitting in Beiju, and relaxing in Wu Yuan, they never appreciate the poetic charm of Suzhou, which is found in the cold alleys.</p>
<p>Enough small talk. Changshu's scenery is famous for Yushan Mountain. Being famous is not necessarily good; this is also a strange thing. The fun place is not Yushan Mountain, but Poshang Mountain outside the North Gate. With Dianfu Temple as its center, the mountain up and down, in front and behind the temple, has the flavor of a corner of West Lake. There you can see waterfalls, much better than Taoyuan Stream. Generally, Taoyuan is secluded, while this place is bright. Taoyuan Stream is hidden in overgrown weeds, and it is indeed difficult to find without the guidance of locals—some locals do not even know about it.</p>
<p>"Wang Si Restaurant's Beggar's Chicken" and "Shi Family Restaurant's Fatty Lung Soup" are equally famous. Wang Si Restaurant is also near Poshang Mountain. I once made a special trip to patronize it, but I didn't get to eat chicken, I didn't get to eat rice, I didn't get to eat dishes, all there was was wine. The signboard was gold, but my two legs suffered, and my mouth didn't feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Yushan Mountain is in the city. Nearby are the tombs of Yan Zi and Zhong Yong. The tombstones are incomplete and unreadable, covered in bird droppings and animal excrement. The ancients are certainly playing a joke, but the locals don't say it's unpleasant. There is a pavilion on the top of the mountain called "Zhen Jiao," which means "Suppressing the Dragon." According to ancient mythology, the immortal Xu Zhenren suppressed a dragon here, which is related to the feng shui of the entire county. A more recent myth says that after the enemy army occupied Changshu, they built fortifications on the mountain and planned to dig a tunnel in the pavilion. As a result, they dug up an ancient well. At the edge of the well was a thick iron chain. The enemy army pulled it up, very long, and pulled up an old ape with white hair, jumping and leaping, with no trace of water on its body. The enemy army saw this as a miracle and respectfully sent it back into the well. It is said that the iron chain and the old ape are still in the well in the pavilion.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity and wanting to see the whole city, I climbed to the top of Yushan Mountain. Who knew that there were soldiers guarding the pavilion? I was driven out before I could even enter. This was an unexpected encounter. From a glance, I managed to see Shanghu Lake. The houses inside and outside the city were densely packed, interspersed with patches of green trees. The people of Jiangnan are fortunate after all. If you look at the north bank of the Yangtze River from the top of Jinshan Pagoda in Zhenjiang, it is extremely desolate, like the vast and boundless lands north of the Yellow River. It is a pity that in such a poor place, the people have enjoyed the "blessing" of "liberation" and still millions are fleeing to Jiangnan. The National Government has returned to its capital, but when will these wanderers be able to return to their homes!</p>
<p>The folk customs here are very simple and generous. Just look at the number of people drinking alcohol, and you can imagine. As the sun sets, with a cup in hand, amidst the salted fish sauce, meat, and peanuts, they have reached their own paradise.</p>
<p>The rice wine is brewed very well, but it is no longer in season. Otherwise, I would very much like to empty my pockets and buy a drunken stupor. Such is the spectacle of life. I am neither a hero nor a superman. Being awake seems more uncomfortable than being drunk. This is not a complaint.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Impressions of Taiwanese Women <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Jianmin</p>
<p>Taiwanese women's clothing is unusually brightly colored, and the styles are all original. Perhaps this is a symbol of depression! However, they don't like to wear kimonos. They usually wear skirts or dresses. They also wear evening gowns at banquets. In the mainland, ladies can get by for a long time with two or three qipaos made of Shilin cloth. This is not the case here. Not to mention housewives, decoration is their profession. Even working women, female workers, or maids have to change clothes three or four times a day. They always carry a rush grass bag to work. The things in the bag are a lunch box, a piece of clothing, and a side dish or a book. They take a break in the morning, open their lunch box for lunch, take a bath after lunch, and change clothes after bathing. Factories and agencies here almost all have bathing facilities. Although the clothes are brightly colored, they are not gaudy or vulgar. The patterns and styles are simply too numerous, and the coloring is bright and dazzling. Some dresses have only one flower occupying the entire area; some dresses are covered with insects, fish, flowers, and plants. It is said to be the crystallization of Japan's economic development: rayon has a soft color and texture, is mass-produced, and is sold at a low price. At this time, cotton cloth is about thirty yuan per foot, while rayon is only about 120 yuan per yard. In my hometown of Hunan, a piece of coarse blue government-made cloth can be worn for a lifetime and can be left as an inheritance for a son to wear. Rayon cannot do that; at most, it lasts a year. Beautiful fibers will eventually collapse, unlike coarse blue government-made cloth, which can be mended when it is broken and can be worn for another ten or twenty years. I have not been to the Paris fashion center, but based on my impressions of watching French movies, I feel that Parisian women's clothing is far less novel and bizarre than here.</p>
<p>At first glance, there seem to be more women than men here. Low-level occupational workers in agencies and organizations are all women. Female workers in factories are usually twice as many as male workers. Hotel attendants, food service attendants, and shop clerks are all women. It can be seen that gender equality in employment is indeed realized. To achieve this in the mainland, it may take thirty to fifty years, or at least ten to twenty years. They are generally healthy, love cleanliness, and iron their clothes neatly, covering themselves in colorful garments. But inside? They all seem to have endless loneliness and melancholy. Some female workers go to the factory at the age of ten, and when their daughters are ten years old, they also go to the factory. The days pass year after year in the sound of the whistle in the morning and afternoon. In other companies and government offices, it is common to see the owner of a document change from a young woman to a middle-aged woman to an aging woman. These subtle things are probably impossible to say. So whenever they have free time, they sing. After dusk, the whole city sings, radios sing, phonographs sing. It is truly a music city. Young people like excitement and naturally find the environment beautiful, but we, who have just come from a quiet city, find it a bit too noisy. (Sent from Taipei on the 18th.)</p>
<h3 id="e140">Cold Drink Exhibition Hall <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Astronomers have predicted that there will be no summer this year. We don't feel anything about it, but cold drink merchants will jump up in fright. If there really is no summer, then the sales of cold drinks will be a cold case and will be frozen in the cold palace forever. But looking at the situation in the past few days, the sun is high, and the asphalt pavement starts to melt at noon. There is summer after all. The astronomers are talking nonsense. The cold drink merchants turn their worry into joy, stop crying and start laughing, and cheer up to focus on their business.</p>
<p>Indeed, summer is the world of cold drinks. Roadsides and streets are filled with cold drinks. It starts in early summer and only quiets down after the Mid-Autumn Festival, lasting such a long time. During the entire cold drink season, Shanghai people don't know how much money they spend on cold drinks. Otherwise, why would there be so many cold drink vendors on the street corners? Unfortunately, there are no accurate statistics. Otherwise, the numbers for this expenditure would be very impressive.</p>
<p>The cold drink market changes with the weather. The cold drink market suddenly becomes active as the weather warms up in the last few days. In Shanghai, the "Paris of the East", the largest cold drink factory is the American-owned Ha Ning Foreign Firm. The factory is located in Hongkou. During the Japanese occupation, it was damaged, and some of the machines were moved or destroyed. But after several months of reorganization after the victory, its products are now (relatively quickly) preparing to supply cold drinks to food stores throughout the city in the fastest way possible during the entire cold drink season.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ha Ning Foreign Firm's cold drinks, one will unconsciously think of the Beauty Brand. The Beauty Brand is Ha Ning Foreign Firm's special logo. All of Ha Ning Foreign Firm's products are marked with the Beauty Brand, and the yellow refrigerators displayed at cigarette shops and fruit stalls are also marked with the Beauty Brand. It is said that these refrigerators were acquired before the war and are now scarce commodities. Existing tenants are unwilling to terminate or sublease them to others.</p>
<p>To get a bird's-eye view of Shanghai's cold drink market, most cigarette shops and fruit stalls operate both businesses, and food stores have also set up elegant seating areas called ice drinking rooms. Flags are hung at the door, fluttering in the wind, creating a new atmosphere. In other places, such as dance halls, bars, movie theaters, and Peking opera theaters, cold drinks are also available for people to choose from, and cold drink locations are also set up in several parks. In this way, wherever we go, if we want to cool off and quench our thirst, we don't have to worry about not being able to buy cold drinks.</p>
<p>There are many food stores in the Great World area, and in the summer, it becomes a concentrated cold drink market. General food stores have all been renovated and have elegant seating areas for cold drinks. Several Cantonese restaurants even display all the ice cream making machines and manufacture them in public. A store near the YMCA that sells Beijing sour plum soup is even more famous. On hot days, young men and women queue up all day long to buy sour plum soup.</p>
<p>Looking at the streets, wherever there are many pedestrians, there are cold drink stalls every few steps, set up in the open air. Tables are full of soda, fresh orange juice, Coca-Cola, etc. Soda can be served with an opening fee, in large cups or small cups, as you wish, and stands across the street from the tea sellers. These are the places where coolies and rickshaw pullers cool off and quench their thirst, appearing on the streets every year on this day.</p>
<p>Looking at the goods prepared by various cold drink vendors, from ice cream, fresh orange juice, popsicles, Snow White, soda, shaved ice to herbal tea, jelly, mung bean soup, and earth cream, a blend of Chinese and Western styles, everything is available, as if Shanghai has a cold drink exhibition hall!</p>

<p>— Zhu Wei</p>
<p>A newborn bear is very small compared to the proportion of other newborn animals to their mothers. It is only eight or nine inches long and weighs only twelve or fifteen ounces. The mother bear often weighs around 500 pounds. So the weight of a newborn bear is only one-five hundredth of the mother's weight. In humans, the weight of an infant is often one-twentieth of the mother's weight.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the American Camel Cigarette Company: Each pound of tobacco can make 350 cigarettes.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Night Stroll <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Li Lingzhi</p>
<p>Taking a stroll on the night streets, I thought of a kind of morbid condition in our women.</p>
<p>When they are alive, they cannot distinguish between millet and wheat, and when they die, they still cannot distinguish between black and white. There are still many women like this today. This is a heartbreaking fact.</p>
<p>To cure this "female morbidity", I think we need to use the "open door to see the mountain" method.</p>
<p>"Open door to see the mountain" is a very straightforward method, calling on our girls not to be confined to the inner chambers, not to be limited to the classroom, not to be stuck in the kitchen. Open the door and go out, and you can see the lofty and majestic mountains. This mountain is the society we come into contact with. For example, if your home is on Shanghai's Avenue Joffre or Nanjing Road, you can see, on the street, that the mountain is certainly not there, but you can see a "wordless book". Most noticeable: In the evening, dancers and prostitutes gather in groups and dance wildly in the streets. You will naturally see the bright lights and goods shining in the windows of many department stores: glass handbags, glass socks, various cosmetics, genuine and fake DDT, with a wide variety of styles. Then you will think about how dancers and prostitutes are produced? Especially today, when there are loud calls to ban dancing and abolish prostitution, what kind of way out will these poor women find? On the same night street, all kinds of situations and all kinds of people will come into your view: A forty or fifty-year-old woman, as thin as a rake, nibbles on the bark of old plane trees next to the trees. As you watch with fascination or sympathy, a ragged old man suddenly runs towards you from the other end, extending his hand to beg for food, and you may be startled. In a corner that the streetlights do not illuminate, something like a stray dog rummages through the garbage. When you walk closer, you realize that it is a thirty-four-year-old middle-aged woman, naked and in rags, scavenging there. Children under the age of fifteen or sixteen pull empty carts and solicit business from you. Beautiful ladies and misses sit in Austin cars and act spoiled to their husbands or fathers. Teenage girls sell flowers to American soldiers with pleading expressions, saying "Best Flower" and "Thank you" Although they speak a pidgin English, it is clear that they have been temporarily trained several times. Dressed in fancy clothes, prostitutes and street girls shuttle back and forth like weavers.</p>
<p>Pay attention! This is a lesson in society! What you read in school turns into real life here. For your own life, you can live and develop with confidence, and there will be no more things happening against your will. Why fear that reading living books will make you a female beggar, a nun, a dancer, a prostitute, or a female traitor?</p>

<h3 id="e144">Star-East Football Match - Revenue of 20 Million Yuan <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>The match between Star-East and the British Navy attracted over ten thousand spectators, a true spectacle in the football world. It has been nearly ten years since a Hong Kong team last visited Shanghai. This time, with a strong new lineup, they presented themselves to Shanghai fans, adding much-needed excitement to Shanghai's long-dormant football scene.</p>
<p>In terms of "business sense" derived from "attendance," the match was a success, generating revenue of over 20 million yuan. Aside from the diverse crowd of spectators, whose details are too numerous to mention, Mayor Wu Guozhen also made a brief appearance, arriving ten minutes before the game started. However, he quietly departed after the opening ceremony, spending no more than twenty minutes at the venue. Former star player Zhang Rongcai was also in attendance, appearing with a plump face and a bulky figure, a far cry from his former agility. It is said that since Zhang's union with the dancer Li Xiaomei, his heart has broadened and his body has grown larger, a credit to Li's influence.</p>
<p>Star-East originally intended to invite Li Huitang to join them on this trip to Shanghai, and Li initially agreed. However, as Li was a pillar of South China Football Club, the club inevitably had some reservations about showing favoritism. Therefore, Li Huitang ultimately decided to consider the bigger picture, unwilling to act alone, and the plan was abandoned. From a business perspective, Li's absence undoubtedly resulted in a slight loss of "ticket" revenue.</p>
<p>Among the thirteen members of the Star-East team, if we were to impartially rank them based on their football skills, the goalkeeper Zhu Zhaoheng should be placed "dead last." Recalling Zhu's performance during the war, he was a second-rate figure in Hong Kong, a B-team player. Ultimately, his experience is lacking, and his skills are not refined enough, so we cannot be too demanding. His "boss," Zhu Chizi, was originally a famous sports reporter for the "South China Daily." After the Pacific War, he formally fell into disgrace, becoming an adjutant to the Wang puppet regime. After the victory, he was finally arrested and imprisoned for violating national law!</p>
<p>Brief Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e145">The World Is Not Without Good People: Two Good Landlords in Nanjing <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>Two people in Nanjing wrote to the Central Daily News: (1) Mr. Wu Weiyang: willing to rent out his spare house, with the rent determined by the tenant. (2) Mr. Hu Chufei: praising landlord Jin Yushan for treating tenants like family. This shows that the world is not without kind-hearted people, and Nanjing already has two of them.</p>
<p>The ceasefire, the drop in rice prices, and the end of labor strikes – these past few days seem to bring many good news. Some say it is "four blessings arriving at the door," hoping for one more to complete the set. In fact, if these three can be maintained permanently, all difficulties can be resolved easily.</p>
<p>Some compare housewives to thermometers, saying that a housewife with a bad temper casts a shadow over the family, making it uninhabitable. Conversely, warmth and vitality fill the house. Similarly, comparing a family to a region's climate, Kunming is the most cherished, while Guiyang and Chongqing are the most disliked. However, the extreme heat of South Africa is frightening, causing people to exclaim, "I can't take it!"</p>
<p>A delegation of dozens of National Assembly representatives from distant Tibet was hosted by the city government, having breakfast at Sullivan, lunch at the Lao Zhengxing restaurant in Xiyuan, visiting the City God Temple, watching Mei Lanfang's opera, and touring factories. It is said that they "felt quite entertained."</p>
<h3 id="e146">Guilin: An Ominous Sign of Fall <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Fisherman</p>
<p>The enemy's atrocities of burning and killing in Guilin during the Xiang-Gui Campaign in the winter of 1944 still send chills down my spine to this day. During the late summer and early autumn, Guilin's Guidong Road, known as Bank Street, witnessed a peculiar sight every evening. Thousands of swallows would suddenly gather on the overhead power and telephone lines, chirping incessantly. They would roost there at night and scatter in the morning, seeming to seek shelter in the atmosphere of the banks and gold shops. It was unknown where these swallows came from, and their numbers increased daily. Initially, they only gathered at the crossroads of Zhengyang Road, but later spread to the surrounding areas. At the time, the elders of Guilin said that this was one of Guilin's auspicious signs, known as "auspicious birds." According to local lore, Guilin had three auspicious omens: the evergreen osmanthus in Bagui Hall, which was a blessing for the people of Guilin; the healthy elders on Mount Laoren, which was a sign of prosperity for the people of Guilin; and the constant chirping of birds on Houfu Street (Guidong Road), which was a symbol of good fortune for the people of Guilin. Little did they know that Guilin would soon fall, suffering unprecedented destruction. The so-called good fortune of the people of Guilin turned out to be the opposite. It was also heard that before the fall of Guilin, the howls of wolves could be heard all night long on Mount Qixing, sounding like weeping, extremely mournful. Only afterward did people realize that the abnormal appearance of swallows and wolves was not a sign of good fortune, but an omen of disaster. Could it be that animals also have a premonition of impending doom? This is truly inexplicable.</p>

<p>— Translated by Bao Zhongqi from Science News Letter</p>
<p>In the past, the world's largest airship was the "Mars," but now the United States is about to complete an airship three times heavier than the Mars, named H-4. The airship is 200 feet long, with a wingspan of 320 feet, powered by four 3,000-horsepower engines, and can carry 42 tons of gasoline.</p>
<p>The cargo hold is large enough to accommodate an airplane. For rescue purposes, the H-4 can accommodate 350 patients plus doctors, nurses, and medical equipment.</p>
<p>The airship has a long range and a speed of 175 miles per hour, requiring over a mile of runway for takeoff.</p>

<p>Legal Inquiries</p>
<p>(1) Li Gan asks: My deceased grandfather had three sons. My father was the eldest son and had two sons. The eldest grandson is twenty years old, and the younger grandson, myself, has one son. The second son (second uncle) had one son, but both father and son are deceased, leaving only a daughter-in-law with no children. The third son (youngest uncle) has one son who is not yet an adult. Who inherits the property of the second son (second uncle), or is it divided equally? (The clan elders intend for my son to be the heir, is this permissible?) The second son's daughter-in-law is immoral. Can she be expelled, or if she cohabitates with a man, can her property be entirely claimed by the heir or divided equally?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] If the second uncle passed away before his son, then the son should inherit from the father, and the daughter-in-law should inherit from the son. However, the son's death must have occurred after the implementation of the inheritance section of the Civil Code on May 5, 1931, for this to apply. Because before the implementation of this section, spouses had no inheritance rights. After the abolition of ancestral temple inheritance, the title of adopted son no longer exists. Adopting another person's children as one's own must be done according to the free will of the adoptive parents.</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Dingzhong of Lin'an asks: In the winter of 1934, A mortgaged three city houses to B for twelve years. At the time of the mortgage, B paid 200 silver dollars. In 1939, A sold the houses outright to C, but the mortgage money was deducted from the selling price of A. Last winter, B's lease expired. C is responsible for redeeming the houses from B. If C redeems with 200 legal tender dollars, can B demand 200 silver dollars? Please advise.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] Regarding the situation you described, you can request the court to fairly assess and increase the payment in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits After the Restoration. There is no basis for redeeming with silver dollars.</p>
<p>(3) Li Yunzhu asks: In February 1943, Li purchased a house from Chen for 26,000 yuan in puppet Central Reserve Certificates, paying 24,500 yuan and owing 1,500 yuan, stating that it would be paid off after land survey. This was during the period of enemy occupation, and the matter was delayed until January 25 of this year. Now Chen claims that the outstanding 1,500 yuan must be calculated as 1,000 times in legal tender. Does the government have such a regulation? How should old currency be converted reasonably?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies] Only the provisions of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits After the Restoration can be consulted.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Talking About Clothing in Early Summer <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Li Pingxian</p>
<p>Women's clothing doesn't have strict rules. Whether you're stepping out for a bit or going to a banquet, you can wear whatever you like.</p>
<p>For most people, material is the standard: good material means good clothes, beautiful design means beautiful clothes. Actually, warmth is first, aesthetics second, and price should not be a standard for beauty. Because between people, or in social situations, the goal isn't to judge wealth or hold a fashion competition to show off.</p>
<p>It's early summer now. If you wear a plain, soft blue silk dress to a summer evening banquet, along with shoes of nearly the same color, you're guaranteed to look gentle, elegant, and win the appreciation of friends and family under the soft lighting. Conversely, even if you wear elaborate, priceless trendy silk, it might give friends and family an unpleasant or unattractive feeling, because it's really not appropriate for an evening party.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>German national Tus Furv Lawan, 40 years old, and Russian woman Nikola Mina, 31 years old, married in Tianjin in April 1934. They lived together at No. 9 Qingdao Road, Tenth District of Tianjin and were registered with a foreign official. Now, the two have incompatible feelings and can no longer live together, so they asked the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin for a consensual divorce. The consulate stated that, in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty, it was difficult to break the relationship without proof from a Chinese court. The two then hired lawyer Fan Duobiao and filed a lawsuit with the court requesting a consensual divorce. On the afternoon of the 28th, the court summoned the two and a settlement was reached, with three articles of agreement attached. The divorce certificate stated: 1. The divorce is mutually desired and there will be no future disturbance. 2. After the divorce, the two parties will be strangers and free to marry as they wish. 3. The two parties are divorced unconditionally, and neither party may claim any rights.</p>
<p>This is a small demonstration of China's improved international standing.</p>

<p>— Han</p>
<p>A new type of automatic dry-cleaning machine has been invented in a British factory. According to the "Engineer" quarterly, this machine is designed to make the washing process fully automatic from beginning to end. You simply place the clothes to be washed in a rotating body, and the processes of dirt removal, drying, and disinfection are all automatic. There are three types of machines, large and small, each capable of washing 30, 60, or 90 pounds of clothes. Unfortunately, many Chinese girls can't afford clothes. The machines may be good, but they can't afford them.</p>

<p>The beautiful Mrs. Aston, 29 years old, dreamed of two things after the victory: first, to get her husband (a lieutenant) stationed overseas out of military service, and second, to help her husband get an ideal job after his return. This time, to elect a judge (a six-year term with an annual salary of $6,000), she thought it was a good opportunity and immediately began campaigning.</p>
<p>She went out and asked the public for help, which finally aroused great interest among the general public. The results revealed that her husband was "victorious right from the start."</p>

<p>Great modern women should have strength like a carved statue in their hearts, a thoughtful sensitivity on their faces, and spiritual depth in their eyes. In her new book "Challenge to Female Compatriots," the famous American female writer Annie Meyer pointed out that American women lack the above qualities. At the same time, she said that the personalities of women in other countries are developing, and great achievements can be expected in the future. But American women seem to have become "finished products."</p>
<p>She also gained some inspiration from the conversations of two returning veterans: The only thing American women are interested in about men is what they can get from them. Here and there, they are either squeezing to buy nylon stockings or patiently lining up in long queues to buy a few loaves of bread. In short, she believes that modern women's horizons shouldn't be so narrow and they shouldn't just play small games with themselves or the men around them. Look at the wider world!</p>
<p>I think this view can also be given to my country's sisters.</p>

<h3 id="e159">A Word Killed Cao E <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Wenxia</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Shun of the Han Dynasty, there was a family named Cao in Shangyu (now Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province), who had only a father and daughter who depended on each other for life. The family was very poor and relied on fishing for a living. The daughter, named E, was only fourteen years old. She was clever, lively, physically strong, and had a strong personality. Although her father was middle-aged, his hair was already gray due to years of overwork. Although Cao E was young, she knew how to comfort her father. She often stroked her father's white hair and said confidently:</p>
<p>"Dad, don't dislike me because I'm a girl. I'll definitely do something better than men for you to see in the future."</p>
<p>"Is that why you're secretly going to the pond behind us to learn how to swim? Is that doing something better than men?" The father said this with a straight face, without a smile.</p>
<p>"Dad, don't blame me. Learning to swim isn't a bad thing. You have to do the god-jumping on May 5th (god-jumping is to welcome the god Wu Jun in the river. Wu Jun Shen is Wu Zixu, who was killed by King Fucha of Wu and thrown into the river. Later people worshiped him as a god). You're old and have no son. If I learn to swim, I can do it for you in the future."</p>
<p>"Silly girl, you're a woman, how can you do things to worship gods?" Dad said, shaking his head and waving his hands.</p>
<p>Although Dad loved his daughter very much, he didn't agree with her showy behavior. He wanted her to be a gentle and refined girl. Cao E's little heart was also a little unhappy that her dad didn't understand her and stopped her freedom. Therefore, even though her father didn't agree, she still secretly learned to swim. When May 5th arrived, Dad went to perform the god-jumping again, but this year he wasn't feeling well and lost his footing, getting swept away by a wave. Cao E was standing on the shore, watching. She immediately wanted to jump into the water to save her father, but was held back by a crowd of people. They all said, "The water is deep and the waves are big. Your father was unfortunately swept away by the tide. Why would you want to let her go to her death?"</p>
<p>Cao E cried her heart out, but no one was willing to let her jump into the water. She watched her father being swallowed up by the wind and waves, and the group of people who saw her as useless still held her back, so she was extremely angry.</p>
<p>She thought, it was the waves that swept her father away, and it was this group of men who looked down on her that killed her father. Now that she couldn't save her living father, she had to find her father's body.</p>
<p>With this determination, she waited by the river day and night. Sixteen days passed, but she still hadn't found her father's body. On the morning of the seventeenth day, she went to her mother's grave and said sadly:</p>
<p>"Mom, if you have a spirit, you should help your poor daughter find her father. If I can't find my father's body today, I'm going to jump into the river to find him."</p>
<p>She left the grave and went to the river again. She searched more carefully that day, but still couldn't find the body. Until the sun was about to set, a group of villagers came to the river to wash their farm tools. One of the young men with particularly sharp eyes spotted a pile of black stuff on the far side of the river. So they went with Cao E to look for it. When Cao E saw this pile of things, she didn't care if it was her father's body or not, and jumped into the river. This pile of dark things was indeed her father's body, so she jumped into the river. This pile of dark things was indeed her father's body. She hugged the body and swam close to the shore, but a meddling youth shouted.</p>
<p>"Hugging a man face-to-face, what is that supposed to look like."</p>
<p>Cao E heard the criticism in the water and was so ashamed that her anger rose. She immediately turned the body over, but she didn't have the strength, and the current was rapid. She couldn't hold onto the body and was swept by a wave to the center of the river. From then on, Cao E could never return to shore!</p>

<h3 id="e160">Some Thoughts on the Development of Shanghai's Cultural Undertakings (Part 2) <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Xian</p>
<p>(6) Botanical Garden</p>
<p>Besides a zoo, the establishment of a botanical garden is also essential. The educational, scientific, aesthetic, and economic values of a botanical garden are similar to those of a zoo, but the land area required is much larger. The world-renowned Kew Gardens in London cultivates rare plants from all over the world, some even arranged according to botanical classification systems. It has extremely large greenhouses with tropical temperatures where tropical plants are grown. Other plants, such as alpine and aquatic plants, are cultivated in artificially created environments that mimic their original habitats. I believe Shanghai should also build a large-scale botanical garden like Kew Gardens.</p>
<p>(7) Observatory</p>
<p>An observatory is a symbol of academic development, so the presence of an observatory in a certain place is enough to show that the cultural level of that place is quite high. A place as big as Shanghai does not have a modern observatory. The so-called Xujiahui Observatory is just a weather station. In order to complete the cultural development of Shanghai, it is indispensable to establish a state-of-the-art observatory.</p>
<p>(8) Art Gallery</p>
<p>Although Shanghai constantly holds various art exhibitions, giving art lovers the opportunity to learn from each other, they are nothing more than renting a corner of a shop or borrowing a public place for a few days to do some business. There is no art gallery where exhibits can be permanently displayed for people to view. Foreign friends who come to Shanghai for the first time and want to see Chinese art simply have nowhere to go. In major foreign cities, it is very common to establish an art gallery to display art pieces. It would be strange not to have one. I hope the Shanghai municipal authorities will quickly establish a permanent art gallery, so that foreigners will not find it strange.</p>
<p>(9) Music Hall</p>
<p>In order to accelerate the cultural development of Shanghai, a music hall, a Chinese opera hall, a Western opera hall, and other large buildings related to music are absolutely essential. They can be used for springtime performances, but also for studying music and opera history. The highest institutions of learning are vastly different from cinemas, dance halls, or concerts that focus solely on profit. I hope the municipal government will change the prevailing atmosphere, improve the position of music and song, and start working on this as soon as possible. Let foreigners no longer say that Shanghai has no culture or cultural awareness.</p>
<p>(10) Literary Hall</p>
<p>The establishment of a literary hall has two purposes: one is to provide writers with a central gathering place for holding seminars, lectures, banquets, and other social events; the other is to provide a suitable place for displaying writers' manuscripts, drafts, and memorabilia for public viewing. Literary halls exist in major cities throughout Europe and America. Shanghai, a place with a rich humanistic tradition and a birthplace of writers, is one of the centers of the national cultural movement. It should have established a literary hall long ago to serve as the center of Shanghai's literary arts.</p>
<p>(11) Two Suggestions</p>
<p>In addition to the above ten cultural undertakings that need to be developed as soon as possible, there are two additional suggestions that are also related to cultural undertakings. First, Shanghai has such a dense population, but there are too few parks and recreational spaces, especially in the city center. I suggest that the Hardoon Garden be nationalized and turned into a park for public recreation. Hardoon made a fortune from the rise in Shanghai land prices during his lifetime. Now that he is dead, it is only right to take from Shanghai and give back to Shanghai, to avoid many adopted sons and grandsons fighting over inheritance and going to court. Second, Shanghai has a large population and expensive land, so there are too few sports fields. Even playing tennis requires paying to rent a court, which is greatly related to the health of the national physique. I suggest that the Racecourse be converted into a Shanghai sports field, allowing the general public to continue practicing horseback riding, but prohibiting gambling-related sports equipment, so that citizens can exercise their bodies. The Racecourse is located in the center of the city, making it extremely convenient for citizens from all districts to go there for exercise and recreation, especially providing convenience for students to exercise after class. Both of these things are easy to do, and we eagerly await the implementation by the municipal authorities.</p>
<p>Building Shanghai's cultural undertakings is not a very difficult task, because Shanghai has many superior conditions.</p>
<p>First, Shanghai is China's economic center and financial hub, making it relatively easy to raise funds. Second, Shanghai is a place where talent from all over the country gathers, especially in the cultural field. Talent is the second essential element for cultural development. Third, Shanghai has convenient transportation and is the gateway to domestic and foreign countries, allowing for cultural exchange and catching up with trends, and enabling the rapid completion of material construction. Fourth, Shanghai has a vast urban area, a magnificent scale, beautiful buildings, and well-developed public utilities, making it easy to coordinate once cultural undertakings are built. With these advantages, I dare say that building Shanghai's cultural undertakings is by no means difficult, as long as the municipal authorities fully understand the importance of cultural undertakings, recognize the backwardness of Shanghai's cultural development, broaden their horizons, have a long-term vision, make overall plans, hire experts, formulate plans, quickly raise funds, and implement them in stages. Anything that should be built by the central government should be requested from the central government; anything that should be undertaken by the municipal government should be implemented by the municipal government; anything that can be built automatically by the people can be encouraged for the people to do. In this way, it will be easy to complete quickly.</p>
<p>In short, Shanghai has too much commercial atmosphere and too little cultural development. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won and construction has begun, we should seize the opportunity, change the atmosphere, and quickly build up cultural undertakings one by one, thereby increasing the city's cultural level and citizens' knowledge, and enhancing Shanghai's position in the international cultural community, so that Shanghai can successfully become a truly modern city. We are all citizens of Shanghai, and we all hope that Shanghai will not only be commercially prosperous, but also a cultural center. [The End]</p>

<h3 id="e163">Scattered Notes from Prison [1] <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Jun</p>
<p>Prison is My University</p>
<p>"Everything works for good, first of all, because the oracles of God were entrusted to them."</p>
<p>——New Testament "Romans" Chapter 3</p>
<p>Here, I quoted a passage from the Apostle Paul's letter to the Romans. The oracles of God referred to here are the truth. So it can also be said: everything works for good, because it can reveal the truth.</p>
<p>Truth cannot be obtained from fantasy, but must be experienced from real life. In the past, didn't we often feel that the scope of our lives was too narrow and our experiences were not enough? But in normal times, we would not take off our shoes and socks and step out of the small circle of intellectuals to contact the vast lives of the people. Even if we did, it would be very artificial and forced, like amateur actors performing on stage, unable to have a deep understanding. Moreover, we still have to guard against all kinds of malicious suspicions and taboos.</p>
<p>But now, people have thrown me into prison. If I were in my hometown, I could still rely on the assistance of relatives and friends, and with my status, I could obtain many conveniences. But if I did that, I would not be able to have such a deep experience. But instead, I was taken to a strange place thousands of miles away from home. In this strange place, I am unfamiliar with the place and have no relatives to rely on. My loved ones and friends are so far away from me; my position and status are of no use to me. I have been reduced to a lowly position, stripped naked, and forced to live with many different kinds of people, becoming one of them, enduring suffering with them, and enjoying happiness with them.</p>
<p>Here, I am able to experience life more deeply. I am able to observe people's lives from another perspective. I am able to excavate humanity from the deepest places.</p>
<p>In prison, life is the most difficult, but human nature is also the most exposed. Here, there is no need for any falsehood or pretense. Whether you are a murderer or a petty thief, no one can deny that you are a prisoner, and your fellow prisoners will not blame you for your mistakes.</p>
<p>Here, there is no need for any status or position. Everyone is treated the same - this is the most equal place possible. A county magistrate sleeps with a deserter, and a university professor makes friends with a farmer. If you are rich, people may not come to flatter you; if you are poor, no one will look down on you. If you have status, people don't need to curry favor with you; if you are humble, you can still enjoy a share of prison rations. Even if you say you have been wronged and think you cannot be compared to the other prisoners, there are many people here who are even more wronged than you.</p>
<p>Here, if people treat you well, it is because you treat them well; if people treat you badly, it is also because you treat them badly. People respect you because you are humble and upright; people despise you because you are cunning and arrogant. In prison, everyone shares hardships together, so everyone needs each other's help, and often those with status and position have to rely on the help of those they normally look down on.</p>
<p>So, I feel that my time in prison is not wasted, and my suffering is not in vain. In this series of days, I have learned many things that I never dreamed of before. I have a better understanding of the meaning of life, and I have experienced the most difficult and profound life in my life. This is not without benefit to me - a person studying in the field of literature and art. Let me repeat the Apostle Paul's words: "Everything works for good."</p>
<p>If life is a school, then prison should be the highest institution of learning. And I finally have the opportunity to study at this highest institution. Prison is my university. Looking back at human history, how many philosophers, revolutionaries, and writers in the world have been forged here? Fortunately, my imprisonment this time is not because I have committed any fault in this world, but because of a great injustice. Therefore, even though people use venomous tongues to slander me and set traps to frame me, they cannot put any dishonorable charges on my body and shame me. On the contrary, I am honest and at ease. I can only comfort myself with this, and use it to comfort my loved ones and all my caring relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Ode to Friendship</p>
<p>What I feel most deeply about this time in prison is the great friendship between human beings.</p>
<p>When we were like defenseless lambs, roped and led to the land of death, my heart trembled, my lips were dry, my limbs were sore and weak, the terrifying ropes bound me, the net of death shrouded me, and an unknowable fate was waiting for me ahead.</p>
<p>When we arrived at a place, I discovered that there were also people inside, people with humanity just like me. They gave us preferential treatment and convenience, and shared our sorrows and joys. Not only did relatives and friends give me enthusiastic concern, fellow prisoners gave me tangible help, and even those in charge of guarding did not stint their warmth and gave me abundant sympathy.</p>
<p>In this series of difficult days, I have lived in the friendship of people. This great friendship has kept me from falling into despair and has given me great comfort. No matter what situation I am in, people have given me sympathy and help. When I am sad, people comfort me; when I am sick and lying down, people support me; even when I am taken to a strange place thousands of miles away from home, I am still filled with people's friendship. Many people I have never met before take off their inner and outer garments to cover me, share their food to feed me, and in these small things are pregnant with the great love of humanity that my little heart cannot bear.</p>
<p>The great friendship of humanity that I have received in this suffering is beyond my ability to describe with pen and ink, nor can this small space contain it. I don't want to go into detail here, because the sympathy and help that people have given me is purely out of a righteous act and does not expect any return. I do not want to express my gratitude here in empty words, lest I profane this divine friendship.</p>
<p>In these days, I have not shed tears because of my own unfortunate experience, but because of the tangible friendship of people, I have repeatedly been unable to hold back the tears welling up in my eyes.</p>
<p>"Wherever there are people, there is friendship." This is a sentence that I experienced in prison. When I was about to leave my hometown on the eve of being taken away, when I said goodbye to two friends in need, I once told them to tell my loved ones and all my caring relatives and friends, and I also used this sentence to embolden myself. It is based on this belief that even though I am thousands of miles away from home, lonely and helpless, I have not been invaded by pain and sorrow. The further I am from home, the more I feel the preciousness of human friendship. At the same time, I also deeply feel that there is still justice and truth between human beings. They are the two daughters of the god of truth.</p>
<p>In prison, I saw those upright people! They are not great figures, but they have great grievances. Although their clothes are tattered and their bodies are covered with sores, they are respected by people.</p>
<p>Under the sun, I also saw those who do evil and succeed. Although they have power and money, they are still despised by people, and even their parents and children are ashamed of their names.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can say: "Wherever there are people, there is friendship, justice, and truth."</p>
<p>These things are only shown to those who have been humbled and suffered. Because those who live in freedom do not feel the importance of sunlight and air; similarly, those who live comfortably and are proud of heart do not feel the preciousness of sympathy.</p>
<p>Only those who are lonely and helpless can appreciate the preciousness of friendship; only those who have been harmed can appreciate the value of justice and truth, which are more precious than life.</p>
<p>Therefore, I understand why beggars can beg from door to door and enjoy themselves; and I understand why vagrants can make their homes everywhere and have smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>Therefore, I also understand why those who are persecuted for justice can calmly sacrifice themselves; and I understand why Jesus Christ was willing to sacrifice himself for the world and be nailed to the cross.</p>
<p>I remember the psalm of David, King of Israel: "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters. He restores my soul; he guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."</p>
<p>I am willing to gird up my loins, put on my sandals, take up my staff, and travel to the ends of the earth, to go to every place where there are people, to experience the great friendship of humanity, to pursue truth and justice.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Further Discussion on Foreign Films in Shanghai <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Zhongyi</p>
<p>My previous article on foreign films in *Chunqiu* has attracted a lot of attention from all sides. Friends who have seen it have come to inquire, and I myself feel that I have not said enough and must add to it.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that film is the most powerful tool for social education. If the Allied nations bring films with educational value to China for business, we should welcome them wholeheartedly. If they make money from us as a result, we will not be stingy. However, we have two requirements for film distributors:</p>
<p>(1) Knowing that China needs widespread knowledge and primary education after the war, we ask that film distributors specifically transport films related to education. American film distributors should automatically refrain from transporting films that are frivolous or toxic to the Chinese people (which may not have a bad influence in the United States, where the level of education is high), such as films about murder, modern theft, the dissolute lives of men and women, and excessive drinking and dancing.</p>
<p>(2) Film distributors' revenue splits are too high. For color films, they often go as high as 60%, while theaters only get 40%. Therefore, theaters have no choice but to repeatedly raise ticket prices, barring ordinary poor viewers from the door. Film distributors' revenue splits are breaking world records. In the United States, they can only take a maximum of 30%, and anything above that is illegal. However, they are acting lawlessly in China, arbitrarily raising the revenue split percentage. Chinese film merchants have no other films to show, so they have no choice but to endure being bullied. Foreign film distributors also know that the Chinese government will not protect Chinese film merchants, so they are even more unscrupulous and arbitrarily set prices. Therefore, I hope that American film distributors will reduce the revenue split percentage on their own initiative in the spirit of Allied friendship and assistance.</p>
<p>At the same time, I hope that those in power in the central government will understand that the film industry is not a commercial industry but a cultural industry. Of course, we acknowledge that many Chinese film merchants do not understand that film is a cultural industry, but only know how to make money to fill their own pockets. We should overthrow these merchants. The government should do its best to support this cultural industry. The methods of support are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Assist cultural figures in establishing privately-owned film studios. Return confiscated property as soon as possible, lend large sums of capital to those with insufficient capital, send film talent abroad to study, and donate public land to film studios as a base... In short, make private film studios start working immediately in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(2) Reduce entertainment taxes and at the same time require theaters to reduce ticket prices to make them more accessible. I have always insisted that the most reasonable entertainment tax is: 10% for plays and 20% for films. A wise government that wants the majority of people to have the opportunity to see films will definitely consider this issue.</p>
<p>(3) Use diplomatic means to negotiate sternly with foreign film distributors: prohibit the import of frivolous or toxic films, and order film distributors to reduce the revenue split to a maximum of 30%. Americans are the most reasonable people. As long as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sends someone to negotiate, I believe they will agree immediately.</p>
<p>(4) Reward Chinese films with educational value, either with funds or with tax exemptions. Then everyone will definitely compete to make new films.</p>
<p>As long as the above points are achieved, the film cultural industry can be brought into line and thrive.</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>If there were a few days when the business of Huichuntang wasn't good, the old woman would pout and grumble, "Strange, why hasn't anyone gotten sick these past few days?" Whenever he heard these words, Liao Lao immediately stopped her, saying, "You can't talk like that. We opened this pharmacy to save people. It's good if no one is sick. We shouldn't just hope for people to get sick for the sake of making money. You have to know that our kind of business is different from other kinds. Our kind of business is close to charity." But the old woman would never think like that. She only knew that doing business was for making money, regardless of what kind of business it was. The purpose was always the same. The one who sells cloth, naturally hopes that people's clothes are often torn so that he has business. The one who sells furniture, naturally hopes that people's furniture often breaks so that he has business. The one who sells coffins, naturally hopes that many people die so that he has business. Similarly, the one who sells medicinal herbs, naturally also hopes that people are constantly sick so that he has business. There is no righteousness in business. If you want to make money, you can't have a conscience! Otherwise, don't do business, don't think about making money. This is a fact, and Liao Lao admitted the old woman's reasoning, but he couldn't bear to think that way! He told the old woman, "My original intention in doing the medicinal herb business was to save people! I would rather make less money than wish for people to be sick." Because of this issue, the two of them argued constantly, but neither could convince the other!</p>
<p>The business of Huichuntang truly encountered misfortune! Two months ago, two foreign doctors emerged from who-knows-what clouds; and then batches of foreign medicine were shipped to the Jinglv Inn. Before long, even a foreign pharmacy opened in the city. The two foreign doctors themselves attached an internal and surgical clinic to this foreign pharmacy. Everyone who went to consult with them neither had their pulse taken; nor did they have to pay a prescription fee; the medicine cured their illnesses, and the medicine was also cheap. So, in everyone's hearts, the two foreign doctors became reincarnations of Hua Tuo; the foreign pharmacy became a miraculous and effective temple. Thus, the fame of the foreign doctors spread throughout Jingzhou; the business of the foreign pharmacy was extremely prosperous. Although a few conservatives were not seduced by the foreign doctors, they were ultimately in the minority. The majority of the common people welcomed the generosity of the foreign doctors. Therefore, the traditional Chinese doctors of Jingzhou frowned, and the traditional Chinese medical profession of Jingzhou lost business! Huichuntang was no exception. For two months, almost no one patronized it. Occasionally, a few doses of herbal medicine were still requested, but pills and powders were simply ignored.</p>
<p>Liao Lao became very anxious! He could accept having no business because he hoped people were healthy, but he was unwilling to close his doors because of the invasion of foreign doctors and foreign medicines. Standing from the position of a traditional Chinese doctor, he felt that Chinese people should not be superstitious about foreign doctors. The treatment methods of foreign doctors were simply Mongolian treatment methods. He had seen a doctor use a pair of scissors to forcibly cut the festering sore into a hole, and then stuff it with some cotton, and that was it. He had also seen a person suffering from tuberculosis. The foreign internal medicine doctor tapped on the person's chest with his fingers for a while, and then took a five-inch-long glass tube needle and stuck it into the patient's wrist vein. All of this horrified Liao Lao, who had some medical knowledge! He thought that this was not treating illness at all, but clearly adding fuel to the fire, making people suffer "foreign" torment! He told everyone how ignorant and barbaric and dangerous foreign doctors were, but on the one hand, he repeatedly stated: he was not worried about his own business, but was worried about ignorant patients being deceived!</p>

<p>— Fei Cun</p>
<p>I linger over reviewing the ruins behind me</p>
<p>Parting the overgrown weeds and thorny bushes of years</p>
<p>Seeking a smile left behind by an old friend</p>
<p>Or the tear stains of childhood mourning a small cat</p>
<p>Even if memory is a pile of broken glass</p>
<p>Cutting my heart</p>
<p>But that dripping blood</p>
<p>Nourishes my about-to-dry-up life</p>
