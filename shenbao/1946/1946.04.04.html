<h3>出發地點尚待規定　東北調處工作困難　陳誠參加軍事三個組</h3>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕東北執行小組地點分配，政府中共雙方尙未獲協議，惟一般判斷，除濟陽中心小組外，遼陽·四平街及營口，均有派遣小組可能。</p>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕東北調處工作困難重重，政府人員認爲，此種隱處只有協取國軍接收，決不能影響國軍接收。中共東北執行小組領隊饒嫩石則發表談話稱：雙方部隊必須停止調動。</p>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕軍事三人小組最近可北來，偕執行部委員鄭介民·葉劍英·饒伯森轉赴東北指示調處工作。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶三日電〕宣傳部長吳國楨今日宣布：軍政部長陳誠已綱張治中將軍爲「軍事三人小組」政府代表。該小組今日下午四時開會，討論儘早前往東北問。但吳氏對於陳誠之能吾能前往東北表示懷疑，因其健康不佳。周恩來將軍今日出席會議時，由新四軍前總司令葉挺將軍伴同前往。</p>
<p>〔合衆社瀋陽三日電〕調處執行部執行小組四隊，刻正等待規定被等在東北之權力，國共雙方對之似頗冷淡。據可靠方面消息，調處執行部執行組主任白魯德將軍可能飛往長春，與蘇方當局討論穌軍撤退後國共接收長春之爭執。衆信軍事三人小組將於下星期抵此，以便對東北當地各司令官有所指示，因截止目前，彼等尙未接得如何對待前往東北各執行小組之訓令。</p>
<p>〔聯合社瀋陽二電〕此間機塲今日發生小誤會，共產黨代表團到達時，爲國軍所阻，稽留四小時始解釋淸楚，國軍將領及美方代表均向共黨人員道歉不置。誤會起因係由於明令翻譯不清所致。另據可靠消息，長春街道所有便衣隊似新四軍徽章，現已由蘇軍使之退出，停止衝突小組政府高級代表四人聞已到達錦州，隨時可以到達此間。</p>
<h3>營口牛莊鞍山等四處　國軍昨先後接收　長春齊齊哈爾附近有戰事</h3>

<p>〔又電〕據悉，東北各鐵路，除中長路外，被拆除達一千九百公里，幾等於二條津浦路或五條膠濟路。沿路橋樑倉庫等，亦被炸毁，又訊，松花江中之船隻，多已失踪、約達二百餘艘。</p>
<h3>特洛曾科通知　蘇軍撤兵日期</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春三日電〕董彥平三日下午一時與特洛曾科會談時，特氏曾將東北各地全部蘇軍撤退日期詳細通吿董氏，其中包括長春·哈爾濱·北安·佳木斯等地，凡此日期，均未經官方發表。然據悉，長春蘇軍最後撤退之期，或在十日以後，其最後一地蘇軍撤退之期，則爲四月卅日，本日會談尙未能將一切未決問題完全解決，故兩氏相約於五日再談一次。又齊齊哈爾現遭共軍圍攻甚急，本日董氏曾以此事通知特洛曾科，特氏仍表示在蘇軍未撤之前，決負責其安全。又悉，馬林諾夫斯基元帥現尙在長春，可能不俟其部隊撒盡即先行離去。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶三日電〕外次劉鍇宣稱：中蘇協定規定蘇軍應撤離大述，但對蘇軍是否眞在撤退一點，並無情報。又謂；經濟談判並未恢復進行。劉氏並承認目下東北在中央政府當局控制下之地區，做該遼闊與重要地區之一小部份。</p>
<h3>政協小組爭執　各方奔走調停</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶三日電〕政協小組憲草審議一日開會時，共產黨與靑年黨發生激烈爭執，表年黨代表陳啓天曾琦聲明退席。昨日各方奔走調停中。</p>

<h3>魏德邁今日返美</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕在華將二載之魏德邁將軍，已定於今晨離華返美，魏氏不願過事鋪張，故囑其僚屬勿到機塲歡送。魏氏在我國兩年，領導盟軍與國軍駢肩作戰，功績斐著。在滬四月主持美陸軍總部，協助我復員工作，深得好評，各界人士，對魏氏之離華，均不勝挽留之意。魏氏離華後，其職務由魏將軍之參謀長麥特克將軍接任，聞魏氏歸國後，將作短期休養，是否再度來華，則彼個人亦不能回答。行政院院長宋子文氏，昨下午五時在西愛咸斯路私邸，舉行鷄尾酒會，爲魏特邁將軍餞行，被邀參加者有中外貴賓多人。又魏德邁將軍昨應胡筠秋氏之邀，宴於梅廬，名音樂家李惟寗亦在座，經魏將軍之要求，常衆彈奏其本人作品，果然不同凡響，魏將軍欣賞之餘，頗擬俟重返中國後，發起一音樂大會，以提高硏究音樂興趣。</p>
<h3>善救總署在平設兒童營業站</h3>

<p>〔中央社蘇州三日電〕陳逆公博定於五日正午開審，自京滬錫各地來蘇觀番之記者，截至今日，已達四十餘人，明日尙有多人趕到。陳逆決定一請辯護律師，高院已指定高溶律師爲陳逆辯護，惟悉，陳逆在獄中已草就長六萬言之訴狀，將於五日開審時，當庭呈閱。蘇省漢奸刻已集中蘇州待審。江蘇高等法院看守所中，現共拘押自京及蘇省各地解來之漢奸八百餘人，中有女漢奸十人，（陳逆璧君及文化漢奸萬孟婉等）此外並有危害已國罪這罪犯三百餘人，彼等將審訊判刑。</p>
<h3>薩奇凡氏來華</h3>
<p>〔美新聞處華盛頓二日電〕據本日此間收到之無綫電報，前美開發局首席設計工程師薩凡奇，已搭機離開羅赴華，在蒐集設計長江水壩工程所需之新資料。</p>
<h3>軍事法庭成立　月內開審戰犯</h3>

<h3>委員名額尚在物議　政府改組將延緩　共軍對整編迄未送交表冊</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶三日電〕關于政府之改組，因各黨派對府委之名額沒去在物議中，迄未有端倪，惟在未來政府中，曾琦與傳斯年將分長社會與教育兩部說，頗多傳聞。　〔合衆社重慶三日電〕宣傳部長吳國楨，論及瞬共爭議三大要點時稱：共產然如能然重其諾言，則國共糾紛未始不能解決。渠稱：關於改組國府一案，共黨至今拒不發表國府委員名單，關於東北問題，渠堅持原來協定，即政府軍隊得自由開入東北。關於改編軍隊一案，吳氏謂政府已於三月廿五日將改編數字送核，當詢以政府對於共黨抗議國軍乘美國戰艦開入東北一事之反響如何時，吳氏稱：軍事委員會發言人正式否認政府曾派遣陸軍五軍至東北，並謂共黨曲解事實，以國破壞改編協議，阻礙接收工作。渠謂，共產黨自始即表示同意，故彼等現正破壞協定，整編計劃規定在十二個月內東北應有五政府軍及一共產軍。已抵東北及尙在途中之國軍共計二十四萬一千五百人，而共產黨則稱有三十萬人，此項指責殊屬可笑。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶三日電〕依照整軍方案第四條之規定，於規定期限內，政府應擬具所保留九十師之表册及最初二個月部隊復員之次序，在同期內中共應擬具其部隊之詳細表册，說明其性質·兵力·武器·旅以上司令官之姓名及各單位之駐地，幷須包括所擬保留十八師之表册及最初二個月部隊復員之次序等，送交軍事小組，而中共方面則雖經小組迭次催促，尙未送達。各方人士對此，極爲關切，認爲此係中共有無誠意實行整編方案之一重大試騐。</p>
<h3>第一個公開審訊的大漢奸　繆逆斌有詭辯　自稱係從事「對日策反工作」庭諭定四月八日宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報特派記者蘇州三日下午十時急電〕僞立法院副院長繆底，三日下午在江蘇高等法院第一刑庭候審。二時由高院派武裝法警六人，赴司前街看守所，將繆逆提押至高院第三刑事被吿候審室。是日高院戒備森嚴，出派武裝法警二人守衛。法庭門外，又派武裝法警四人，徒手二人戒備。法庭內派有武裝法警二人，徒手二人差遣。二時半，石美瑜庭長亦入席，推事陸家瑞，余樾，書記官朱鳴球，入席登座。檢察官李曙東亦蒞庭執行職務。旋傳繆逆入庭應訊。是日繆斌身着醫色條嘰嘰夾袍，藏靑色華達呢夾褲，黑皮靯，光頭未帶帽。經石庭長審訊至四時四十分完畢，令繆逆坐於椅上休息。即傳證人僞立法院委員周偉入庭。周逆因年邁賜坐訊問，繼由李檢察官發表意見畢，各由辯護律師解樹强，張竺，李福生三人分別辯護，至五時二十分辯論完畢，繆逆要求朱書記官宣　供詞，經繆逆糾正錯誤後，即在筆錄上簽字。庭上對繆逆與辯護律師要求向眾統局調查證據一點，予以駁斥。至六時三十分，由石庭長宣吿辯論終結，諭令於四月八日下午二時宣判，繆逆回押，即行退庭。是日京滬各報記者及攝影記者來蘇採訪。高院門前及看守所門前，擁有大批觀衆，爭看繆逆眞面目、當審訊之時，繆逆之妻項秀錦，亦立於庭外旁聽。各報攝影記者尤爲活躍。繆述提出看守所時，沿途攝影記者即跟隨攝影，審訊時亦異常忙碌，機聲咯咯，不絕于耳。</p>
<p>繆逆供詞</p>
<p>據繆逆供稱：年四十四歲，無錫人，庭上問其職業時，答稱：「一向是幹政治的』。民國十一年加入國民黨，從未開除黨籍。庭長諭吿被吿己由檢察官依懲冶淡奸條例第二項第一款及第十二款起訴，問其有何話說。繆即大逞詞鋒，儼然演說。略謂彼自軍統局解快院的，撰有「我的對日工作」一巨册及辯書，並謂甚願乘此機會，公布其十年來對日策反之秘密</p>
<p>彼於民國二十年自美返國，本擬從事實業</p>
<p>但目覩「日寇進兵」，欲求强國之方，遂於民二三著「武德論」，開明書局出版，提倡道德。後至北平遇何總司令，深知「全面抵抗，勢所必然』。彼因深知日本國內的有暴動，極爲不安，遂欲策動日本國內之革命。二十五年曾往日本，抵東京之日，即二二六事變之前夜，共首領亦與彼熟悉。返國後曾以詳情報告何總司令，謀所以「以敵制敵」之方，軍委會第二廳廳長楊宣誠將軍，即曾與彼同行赴日也。</p>
<p>彼自稱主張「明哲保羣」，而不「明哲保身」。彼深佩領袖「地無分南北，人無分男女老幼」一致抗戰之主張，故以「四萬萬老百姓之中的一份子」的資格，從事抗日。彼之組織「新民會」，亦即從事策反之故。新民會以「武德論」改名爲「新民精神」，而「武德論」固戰前即已公開發售者也。其時繆逆滔滔不絕，旁若無人，由庭長加以制止，改爲問答。</p>
<p>彼之不赴內地，從事抗戰工作者，「以欲繼續策反工作之故」。但其「工作」，於三十二年八月以前，並未請示中央。</p>
<p>二十六年冬，繆由許修直之介紹，赴北平與日特工要員吉野弘實，及吉村虎雄晤面，二十七年一月參加新民會，任副會長，正會長係王克敏。新民會與「大民會」及偽滿之「協和會」，宗旨大體相同，主張中日「滿」合作，經濟提携。庭長即問：「要打倒重慶政權罷」？繆初猶謂爲係民衆團體，經追詰後，答稱：「當然是有的」。神態極窘。</p>
<p>繆逆又會加入所謂「東亞聯盟」。彼謂此組織實係日本反對七七事變之軍人石原莞爾所領導，並謂石原極反對東條。</p>
<p>王克敏之後台日本特工要人秀澤開策與根本博等，邀被參加，「余即將機就機」，時民國二十八年五月也。</p>
<p>繆逆稱曾數度往日，晤日軍政要人如近衛小磯坂垣荒木山本等多人，彼雖係美國留學生，而精通日語，無需舌人。二十八年六月，因日人今井之介，在東京一日人古賀之家內，與汪逆精衛及周逆佛海晤面、極爲機密，商組織僞府事。返國後，在北平曾與石原莞爾及東久　宮會見。</p>
<p>二十九年十月離平，至南京見汪。三十年任僞立法院副院長。其間與李長江往還頗密，並代李接洽向汪投順，因李本繆之下屬，但李明揚可證明此舉實係一種謀略。三十一年，汪逆曾因故秘密將　撤職，但表面上則改任他職。</p>
<p>三十三年一月，汪逆死後，繆逆自稱即主張乘機取消偽府，曾與同佛海及松井石根等談過。二十四年三月，「奉中央密令，與小磯秘密代表山縣大佐商談，擬組「留守府」以代何政權。時小磯東久邇等均主和，因日本現地軍人反對作罷。</p>
<p>繆氏自稱於三十二年八月起，即因軍統局顧站長及一女同志之介，加入軍統局，歷次秘密通報，曾得戴雨農氏嘉獎記功。是時庭長出示軍統局來電，則雖認爲繆固「略有貢獻」，而發動於日軍已節節敗退之時，不免投機取巧，仍請依懲治漢奸條例，予以檢舉。故庭上對繆要求調查證據之請，逕予駁回。並宣讀領袖手諭，亦主將繆按律辦理。旋於由檢察官起而論吿，指出繆逆自辯各點，均無佐證。而繆之律師解樹强，張竺，季福生等先後辯護一過，略謂至少應按「漢奸自苜條例」予以考慮，對不調查李明揚允表遺憾。繆斌亦言：「前後矛盾得太利書，要求調查證據，這個樣子太寃枉了」。</p>

<h3>為兒童請命！</h3>
<p>今天是抗戰勝利後的首屆兒童節。我們自有兒童節以來，轉瞬十五年了。此十五年中，大半的歲月，在砲火中度過，成千成萬的兒童，遭受荼毒蹂躪的痛苦。現在天日重光，河山還我，親愛的小朋友不必離鄉背井，不必忍氣呑聲，更不致再在暴敵威迫之下去受奴化敎育，他們都可重復回到故鄉的懷抱，受到暖的陽光。兒童們逢此令節，想必可以收拾起辛酸的涕淚，大家重來携手歌舞，共伸慶祝了罷。</p>
<p>然而，事有出乎意外者。昨爲兒童節的前夕，我們却得到一位剛從內地來上海的中學生王有常君的一封信，他訴說了他的失望，他呼籲着要改造現在的學校，眞使我們感動。我們且先把他信裹最要緊的一段話摘錄在下面：</p>
<p>「當我剛回到上海的時候，我是多麽快活呀！我看見了故鄉，幾年以前曾有我足跡的故鄉。去年冬天我剛到上海時，我進了一個名譽頗不壞的一個學校。於是我就進了這不是二十世紀的學校，我開始失望了！爲什麼呢？理由很簡單。因爲我已經看見過進步的學校。它的設備完美嗎？不！在抗戰中的大後方，根本談不上。而且營養呢，一樣的不好。可是這時，我們充分的利用了牠，使牠每一樣都變成我們身體的一部份，更使牠增加我們每一人的健康。面現在呢？我雖能吃到似乎很有營養的食品，但是好像因此而我的期望反遠離我了。我期望的是什麽？只是健康。我學習的是什麼？是準備在二十世紀的世界上競爭。可是到了上海，我失望了！我看不見球塲！我看不見露營用的帳篷！看不見排球籃球！取而代之的，是白瘦的臉，鼻樑上還多加一付眼鏡。我迷惑了！我迷惑這出現在我面前的是否是一羣靑年！我疑惑是否是走進了養老院！我看不見運動的精神，我看不見「工作時工作，玩時玩」的精神，而代替的是逃課，賭錢，談戀愛！這是他們的罪過嗎？不！這不是他們的罪過，這是我們的幾位老前輩辦敎育者的罪過！他們剝奪了學生們每一些時間。可是往往還有有人在稱贊他們，歌頌他們，贊成他們剝削學生的皮鞭。但是這也不完全是他們的罪過，因爲他們盲從了贊助他們的一些十九世紀的古人。現在我們每天八小時，曾上九小時的課，這幾乎將榨盡了了我們每一滴的腦汁，我們還有多餘的時間來作課外活動？因此，我們養成了不團結不合作。我想外國人所以稱我們做一盤散沙，就是因此造成的。現在我想將我體騐到的說一說。同學們因爲腦力精力不够，因此先生講的聽不懂，因爲聽不懂，和時間緊促的關係，課下的準備就很不充分因此更加跟不上。久而久之，因着身心兩方面的關係，就索性不讀。但他的多餘的精力如何呢？就來作不正當的娛樂！牠就使靑年墮落，使他們模糊了人生的意義。由此，這十九世紀的老機器造出了兩種典型的靑年：一，彎背曲腰戴着深度眼鏡的前淸老秀才式的所謂優秀份子（但只是一些人的觀念），他們只知道背書默書，而受着一些天的獎勵稱贊。可是他只是古代的遺物，不能作二十世紀的鬥士。他只能落伍淘汰。二，隋落的靑年。有時他們的口中也居然出現民主等字樣，可是他們的民主旣無理論，又非實際！』</p>
<p>王君雖祗是某一個中學的學生，他的來信雖寫得草率，但我們祗要讀了這一段，已經不忍卒讀了，彷彿一羣面黃骨瘦的「老成少年」在我們面前作那彎腰曲背的怪相，同時彷彿另有一羣西裝筆挺追逐對象的公子哥兒，在互相鬥富比闊。的確，中國未來的主人如果儘由這一些模型裏造成，那眞可怕極了！我們每逢兒童節，就隨我聽到比賽啊，開會啊，給獎啊，熟鬧是熱鬧了，但試問我們平日究有多少父母師長，費多少精神時間，曾爲兒童打算過？說到體格罷，兒童死亡率之高，達到每千人中二百六七十的程度；因爲食物中蛋白質，丙種維生素，與鐵質的缺乏，兒童的貧血已成爲一般的現象。說到智識罷，失學兒童還是佔了學齡兒意的過半數。說到道德罷，貧家小戶流浪拾荒的固然談不到，即在所謂富有之家，吃酒賭錢聽書看戲也早已相習成風，奢侈豪華，勢利尖刻，在這些環境裏何能望其培養出惇樸壯健的靑年？我們想想，我們這民族如果只管生男育女，却不會養，更不會敎，聰他們去，我們實在對不起兒童，也對不起祖宗！</p>
<p>現在的世界，已經跨進了原子能的時代了。儘管人類覺悟。世界和平，然而一個人要享和平幸福，總得先有健康的身體，一個國家要享和平幸福，總得先有健康的民族。何况和平還有待於人類的努力，和平還得用武力來維持，我們要研求科學。要充實國防，那一樣不需要從强健體格做起？王君說，他每看見新聞片或體育影片中健壯的外國人，就害怕了，害怕寄託在這些靑年病夫身上的中國的命運！這是何等驚心動魄的呼籲</p>
<p>所以，我們與其僅僅在兒童節那一天，爲兒童快樂作些點綴。還不如大家認眞的做幾件有益兒童的促進民族健康的工作。卑之無甚高論，我們且舉出下列幾點，爲兒童請命：</p>
<p>第一，我們要求市上絕對沒有流浪兒童，尤其不可容許有童年的乞丐。如何在最短期間籌辦習藝所之類，將所有流浪兒童收容敎養，使獲一技之長，足以自食其力，這是地方自治應有的事業，也是政府和市民大家的責任。</p>
<p>第二，我們要求全市沒有失學的兒童。普及敎育，掃除文盲，這都是幾十年來耳熱能詳的老調，但可惜到如今還沒眞正做到。假定上海全市三百四十萬人中十分之一爲學齡兒童，則三十四萬小學生如何收容入學，使他們眞能免費上踝，實在是市政府的一件大事。我們並不必苛求每一小學生終日上六小時的課，如果能讓他們半天入學，半大自修或運動，實在更有益處。</p>
<p>第三，我們要求全市多闢公園曠地或運動塲游泳池之類，儘量使兒童有練習健身正當娛樂的機會。</p>
<p>第四，我們要求中小學的課程應趕速重加修訂，不可再迷信各科專家，只顧多多注入智識，將踝程時間加得過分繁重，以致學生不堪負擔，戕賊了他們的身體。我們以爲功課與其『貪多嚼勿碎」，何如「少吃多滋味」。中小學校，應該以音樂和體育爲陶冶學生品性體格的必修科目。星期休沐，尤應多多提倡遠足，鍛練身心。中小學生體格如果衰弱多病，縱有大好學問，將來成年後還是廢物！</p>
<p>第五，我們要求政府和社會多多建立理化試騐室，兒童圖書館，並大量攝製和輸入敎育電影片，同時嚴禁一切誨淫誨盜的圖書電影等等，使兒童能在凈化社會之中培養成長起來，他們有科學的頭腦，健壯的身體，可以在未來的世界潮流中立足</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日高院審理之漢奸案，茲特分誌如下：</p>
<p>周純裕</p>
<p>四十三歲，寧波人。曾任偽米糧編制委員會秘書長。於卅三年十一月任內，被控貪汚凟職，爲敵憲扣押，轉解僞法院判處有期徒刑五年，執行在案。勝利後，該案經現高檢處於三月十三日提訊偵查，認爲觸犯懲治漢奸條例，乃提起公訴。昨晨開庭時，被吿對於曾出任僞職，供認不諱。謂因與僞米統會主任委員袁履登有世交，兼同鄉之誼，故受袁之聘，出任此職。但稱雖任僞職，未曾稍忘國家。被人挾嫌誣吿，請庭上明鑒云。因辯護律師陳霆銳尙在重慶，被吿曾要求延期審理，庭上核詞，諭令押候再訊。</p>
<p>張素行</p>
<p>係偽最高法院院和工張韜之第三子，卅歲，杭州人。被按曾任偽上海戒烟局南市查烟所所長，及僞上海市東一區區公所法律專門委員會委員等職。並與盛逆幼質（即盛老三）有來往。在盛之販毒機關「宏濟萎堂」內，囊助蓋章分包等工作。勝利後，由警局逮捕，轉解高檢處，經提起公訴。昨晨被吿對於所控各節，力加否認。庭上因有盛之口供可證，核詞之下，諭令改期再訊。</p>

<h3>在華日戰爭罪犯　週內可公開審訊</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕軍事委員會第一綏靖區司令部軍事法庭，於上月中旬成立以來，對日本在華暴行之戰爭罪犯，依據人民控吿，由本市軍事機關先後逮捕，共計六十四名。業經檢察官初步偵查完畢，現暫押提籃橋看守所。此項戰犯，大部均係前日本憲兵隊官佐，其中二名將於日內再度偵訊後，可能在本星期中公開審訊。惟因法庭地位狹窄，對各界請求旁聽者稍予限制。本報記者，昨承賀副官官華强陪同參觀，方行佈置完竣之軍事法庭，其陳設頗簡單而莊嚴。中懸巨幅國旗，國旗下設審判官席五座，左旁爲檢察官及翻譯官席，右旁爲書記官席，圍以半圓形木欄。欄外第一排爲新聞記者席，席後五排爲旁聽席，約可容五十人。又本埠美軍方面請求在開審時派員出席旁聽，已獲照准。惟對日戰俘集中營官長之呈請旁聽一節尙在考慮中。</p>

<h3>人力車昨幾絕跡　反對車租劇漲發動全面罷工　萬餘絲織工人冒雨遊行請願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕一度轉趨沉寂之全市工潮，昨以人力車夫發動全面罷工，及絲織業男女工人萬餘名之遊行請願，而重現澎湃之勢。此次人力車夫之金面龍工，起因於車租之突漲。據悉車租原爲每日六百元，惟不及句日，已漲至二千餘元。致昨日上午，即有三千餘車夫發動罷工，分頭在各馬路通知各車夫。迨傍晚時，已陷於全面罷工之境。</p>
<p>據悉本市現有力車公司一百二十餘家，人力東三萬七千餘輛，車夫的五萬餘人，一旦全面罷工，影響市區交通，殊匪淺鮮。聞人力車夫互助會，刻已進行折衝。社會局方面對此亦倍加關注</p>

<h3>北站巡禮　今日開幕的餐室外景　充滿着熱帶情調　聯總運到數百輛貨車</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　惺吾</p>
<p>不論在平時或戰時，鐵道交通，總是佔着重要的地位。她非但不能有片刻停頓，還需時時的改進以適應需要。勝利後的中國，當然不能忽略了鐵道的交通，你祇要去北站巡視一週，就可以知道當局對鐵道的重視了。</p>
<p>京滬滬杭兩路，雖然交通工眞極度缺乏，仍舊避免不了旅客的擁擠，但敵僞時期的「黑帽子」，「黃牛黨」，敲詐勒索……：早已一描而盡了。</p>
<p>短小精悍的童士達總站長——北站實際負責人之一，記者昨日晤見了他，他於百忙中抽身陪記者參觀將於四日開幕的北站餐室。紅色的屋頂，鮮艷的牆壁，尤其門前的一片棕櫚樹和芭蕉，充滿着熱帶情調。這裏木來是票房，經過三個月的裝修，化了一千多萬元才成功的。有三千元一客的特快餐，一千元一客的芥厘雞飯，與六百元一杯的咖啡，九百元一瓶的啤酒，一二明治，土司，牛奶，可可，什景飯，蛋炒飯，以及一切中西點心，　　　　　·女侍者都受過嚴格的訓練，廢除小帳陋規，旅客貪的問題從此是解次了。</p>
<p>旅客拖了笨重的行李，多不方便，所以北站已設立了一個行李寄存處。你可以放心的把行李交給他們。慢慢的派人來取，滿二十四小時，祇收費一百元。</p>
<p>車站長說：一汽油火車即將延長路綫，由上海可以直達南京，特別快車需要七小時半的京滬行程，汽汕火車祇要五小時半，就可以把你從上海送到南京。這個計劃，大槪半個月以內就可以實行。至於「太湖號」的名稱，票價，停車站等問題，皆還在商討之中」。因爲火車班次的增加，所以兩路各班火車行駛時間即將全部更動，到南京的夜車，可能在下午十時開出。</p>
<p>童總站長又吿訴記者一個最新鮮的消息。他說剛剛由歐陽秩段長那裏來的，節直是個喜訊：聯總已運到貨車三百八十二輛，內分平車，高邊車，篷車，這批貨車已送到戚　堰廠修理後即可應用。今後兩路的貨運，無疑的將大大增加。另外聯總還有十四輛燒柴汕的機車，已到上海，將由交通部分配派用。京滬，滬杭兩路近水樓台，必能配到相富數量。所以童站長對於今後兩路的客貨運，皆絕對的樂觀。</p>
<p>春假中旅客特別多，故自昨日起，滬杭問增加一班特別快車，每天上下行各一次，杭州時四十五分開出，上海下午二時五十五開行，頭二三皆有，這當然也是旅客的福音，尤其是春遊的人們的一個喜訊。</p>

<p>（本報訊）市參議會審查委員會昨日上午召開第一次分組審查會議，下午三時二十分舉行第六次大會，計到議員二十七人，收到提案十件。</p>
<p>地政局報告</p>
<p>主席徐寄廎議長報吿過後，即由地政局長陳石泉報吿半年來工作情形。略謂：本市爲全國經濟之樞紐，以前因有租界治外法權之關係，洋商地產公司及外僑置產等，情形複雜，再經八載敵僞盤踞，地政更形紊亂，故地政局特別注重淸理地權整理地籍之工作，其中心工作約可分爲六項：（一）編制各區圖册，並依天然地形，重劃黃浦區界綫，（即前公共租界與法租界），計整理永租契卷共的四萬份。（二）本市所轄三十一區，總計面積一。三三四·〇四九市畝，全部測量工作，期於本年度內完成。（三）敵僞時期巧取豪奪，地籍混亂，經界不明，故地局積極辦理土地所有權及移轉登記，土地推收，永租契土地登記，敵僞組織所爲土地權利登記之淸理等工作。（四）黃浦等六區分組調查，搜集資料，分定地價區段。繪製圖表，並組織標準地價評議委員會，議決暫就民國三十年之估價爲標準，照倍數提高（現爲四百倍），以配合土地登記。（五）敵偽地產公司，飛機塲，農場等所强迫徵收及侵佔之土地，達十六萬一千九百七十餘畝，此等土地可由業主聲請發還，或補給徵收地價。（六）公有之土地，據地局初步統計及調查所得，已共有一·一八六坵，五·七七六畝，較前已增加三倍半，但其中必尙有脫漏，故決繼續淸查，尤其如前法租界公董局之產業，多數被法領事館隱匿，現正由市政府交涉收回，並向中央請示循外交途徑收回之。除以上六點外，陳局長又報吿完成永租契道契之淸理，敵僞時期產權料紛，及業主不在上海之土地登記等最困難問題。</p>
<p>外僑置產問題如何克服困難</p>
<p>陳局長報告守畢後，各義員即紛紛提出詢問，首由徐士浩提出四點：1土地登記限期過短，與其一再展延，不若事前作準確之預計，寬展登記時期。2登記之收據最好註明道契號碼畝數，以昭鄭重，並可使市民作經濟上之運用。3登記時地權證件，應迅速發還，或用照片。副本等代替。4土地法上登記公吿等時期太長，現地局呈請中央核准减短，市民固然稱便，然不知是否經過立法機關。葉風虎亦詢問將來外僑置產，敵僞地產處理方法，及公地淸查時之種種困難，如何克服。曹俊詢二點：（一）敵侵佔市民土地所建築之飛機塲。農塲，現皆被航空委員會及農林部接收，不知如何辦法？地政局應即淸查業主，分別發還，或另定適宜處置辦法。（二）土地測量是否有短期內完成之計劃？</p>
<p>地產估價標準未免嫌其不均</p>
<p>潘序倫建議，土地登記，最好能分區限期完成，又前超出土地法所收之登記費，最好能發還。佔價以三十年爲標準，增加至二百倍，近又調整至四百倍，而房租則依民國二十六年爲標準，僅六十倍或四十倍，未免她其不均。周學湘·趙班斧·季灝·徐永祚·陸惠民等詢問對房屋租賃管理委員會之處理房屋糾紛，及八百餘幢被敵僞侵佔房屋之發還等問題。水祥雲。傳統先·李伯嘉·范才驥·陶廣川等對土地政策，土地登記之手續，登記費用，土地估價，淸查公地等皆有所詢問。</p>
<p>答復各點</p>
<p>繼由陳局長一一答覆：（一）關於登記，業已展期六月，瑞正補行登記中，分期登記可收敦促之功。（二）收據註明畝數辦法，亦已採取改善。（三）土地權證件，的半月可審查完畢。（四）至於估價，決予愼重處理。（五）外僑置產，將候中央指示，現中美新的規定外僑亦可有置產權，中央將有整個辦法。（六）敵僞侵佔之土地，現已向航委會及農林部商治，至於飛機塲，農塲將補給徵教價。（七）前多收之登記費，因種種困難，勢將不能發還。（八）屋荒問題，租賃委員會僅係調處糾紛，减少房屋訴訟之機關，限於經濟，不能再予擴展。（九）關於前法公董局之房地產，現有中法學校·法國兵營·巡捕醫院及法領事館等，希望參議會以民意機關，促使法常局作友誼之交還。陳局長答覆完畢後，徐議長宣稱原定於星期四截止接收提案，現決延長至星期六，下午六時二十分始吿散會。</p>
<p>分組審查會審查各提案</p>

<p>上海市兒童健康比賽第一號小寶寶吳和平：體重十六磅</p>
<h3>兒童節感言</h3>
<p>— 錢大鈞</p>
<p>兒童爲民族繁殖之細胞，亦爲國家未來之主人，直接關係民族生命之延續，間接關係國家命運之隆替，美前總統胡佛嘗謂『世界進步以兒童脚跟爲轉移」誠以「二十世紀乃兒童之世紀也」。</p>
<p>本市人口衆多，根據最近調查結果，計有三百三十四萬五千餘人，其中，十四歲以下之兒童，佔百分之十，是以本市兒童問題極關重要，如何加强兒童敎育，維護兒童健康，實爲常務之急，凡此政府固應竭力以赴，而吾全市市民，兒童家長，亦應深體斯旨，共同合作，方易收效。</p>
<p>即以兒童敎育而言，學校敎育與家庭敎育，必須同時並重，倘兒童有良好之家庭環境，則耳濡目染，必能成爲良好之兒童，反之，近朱者赤，近墨者黑，成人不良之習慣，極易予兒童深刻之影響，如此則不獨家庭教育不能與學校敎育相配合，且因家庭環境之不良，轉而減低學校敎育之功效，至於兒童健康，允須家長善爲注意，首須着重營養，對於飲食方面，務須斟酌兒童年齡與體格，予以適當之供應，其次對於兒童疾病，更須特別注意，例如砂眼，中耳炎，以及扁桃腺等疾病，爲一般兒童常有，但爲家長者多半忽視，殊屬非是，此外衣食住行方面，亦須求共合理，若有哺乳無定時，衣服過緊或過厚，緊關窗戶，不使空氣流通，惟恐兒童傷風等事，皆與兒童健康有碍，吾國嬰兒死亡率，于人之中，年達二百乃至二百七十五人以上，爲其他各國所不及，此即忽略兒童健康所致。</p>
<p>本市値復員之初，百端待舉對於兒童福利事業，限於經費，未能盡如理想，今後如何切實努力，固有賴社會人士之一致協助，允須兒童家長之自動注意，木年兒童節，衛生局特舉行兒童健康比賽，其用意即在喚起社會注意兒童健康，重視兒童地位，從而謀兒童福利事業之擴展，深望全市市民，切實汪意，廣爲宣揚，今後吾國兒童健康，日趨進步，體格日就堅强，斯則國家之大幸也。</p>
<h3>我們如何對兒童負責</h3>
<p>— 兪松筠</p>
<p>有一位名人說過：「二十世耙是兒童的世紀」。不錯，過去數十年來，在敎育上，「兒童中心」的思想，的確盛極一時，尤以第一次大戰終了以後一二十年爲然。可是不幸在此短短的數十年內，先後發生了兩次大戰。戰爭對於人民生活，殘害最甚。多少兒童，在砲火中犧牲了生命。多少兒童，因家園被毁而流離失所。多少兒童，得不到保養。又有多少兒童，雖然還有父母師長的照護，部因種種條件缺乏，所以無論在體格上或心理上，都不能發育的十分完滿。</p>
<p>在戰爭期間，凡屬有家庭可依有學校可進的兒童，都可說是萬分幸運的了。但據上海和重慶幾位專家的硏究，我國戰時兒童膳食中，每日供給之營養素，如熟能·油脂·蛋白質·鈣·磷·鐵及維生素甲·丙·丁，皆感不足；其中蛋白質缺乏之程度，已足使血漿中之蛋白質含量有百分之二二在正常血漿蛋白質最低限度以下。因蛋白質。維生素丙與鐵三者同時缺乏，結果一般兒童，皆呈貧血之象。此種營養不良情形所生的影響，可使兒童發育，較平時遲緩一年。（據王成發氏報吿）。即此一點，便可槪見兒一童所受的委屈爲如何，國家所受的損失爲如何！</p>
<p>於此我們深深感到釀成戰爭的侵略思想之可惡與可怖。德國在威廉第二與希特勒統治的時代，把國內的兒童，看做對外發展的一宗資本，培養兒童就是培養侵略的力量。日本也是這樣。近百年來，日木對於兒童敎育，十分注意；但注意的動機，只為的是要造成一批批爲日本帝國主義効死的工具。侵略思想發展的結果，還不僅是侵略國家的兒童受到荼毒，而且也傷害到全世界兒童的生機。</p>
<p>現在戰爭結束了，我們一方面當然要儘速謀救濟，使飢寒中之兒童，獲得衣食；使失學中之兒童，獲得敎育。而且更進一步，我們應當利用科學知識，依據兒童的天然要求，使得兒童完滿的生長。另一方面，我們爲兒童的將來，也爲着類的將來，必須積極的發揚我們中國累世相沿的和平思想。我們的和平思想，具見於古聖先賢的遺訓中。禮記「禮運」篇要求「幼有所長」。必須如此關護兒童，則民族生機，方不至於窒塞。孟子說：「幼吾幼以及人之幼」。必須具此博愛精神，方可以使兒童眞正得到幸福，而且免除將來的禍害。</p>
<p>今天是勝利後第一個兒童節，我們想到過去大家對於兒童關護的不周全，而且還有許多摧殘的行爲，實在感覺痛心。自今以後兒童謀永久的幸福。我們要使「二十肚紀是兒童的世紀」這句話，不僅是一種理想或希望，而是一件確切不移的事實。</p>

<h3>紀念勝利後第一次兒童節的意義與責任</h3>
<p>— 孔祥熙</p>
<p>今年今日，是抗戰勝利後的第一次兒童節，也可以說是全國各地得一致舉行的兒童節。在這舉國勝利聲中，來紀念這一個與民族興替攸關的兒童佳節，實在有說不盡的高興與快慰。</p>
<p>回憶兒童節的起源，係於民國二十年由本人以中華慈幼協會會長的資格所提倡，呈請政府採納頒定，迄今已滿十五週年。時常外侮日亟，國難方股，中華民族，正處於艱苦危急的環境中，當時國人深覺欲强國必先强民，欲强民必自兒童身上做起。那時的口號是復興民族，必先培育兒童。自七七事變以後，我全民族更以血肉抗禦日寇的侵略，而作生死存亡的奮鬥，是以八年來，每年的兒童節，都是在沉痛艱苦的日子中渡過，且不能全國一致舉行，撫視當日兒童。瞻望民族前途，固亦不勝期慰興奮，惟其心境裏究沒有像勝利後今日的痛快歡樂。</p>
<p>八年的艱苦，贏得了最後的勝利，國內的團結，奠定了建國的基礎，，新中國的前途，充滿了光明與希望，在這百年奇恥一旦謭　，國土光復，自由重現的今日，我們來紀念這偉大的兒童節，實在有其特殊的義營意與價値，木人今站在中華慈善幼協會會長的地位，略抒所感，以吿同胞：</p>
<p>（一）紀念兒童節要完成建國大業</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，建國伊始，抗戰的事業雖極艱苦，建國的任務尤其繁重。這種繁鉅偉大事業的完成，不但我們本身這一代要　勉以赴，更須要下一代的國民繼起努力。兒童是民族的新血輸，文化的承繼者，他們將來能否肩負這繼往開來的鉅任，胥視其今日所受的敎養培育如何以為定。在我們的想像中，雖有一個當强康樂新中國的遠景、但不要忽略了建設和支持這一個新中國的將來主人我們想要把這一次用無數頭顱鮮血所爭取的勝利，，能够永持，所換來的自由，得以長保，必須使下一代及今後世世的國民健全强盛，奮發有爲。在紀念兒童節的今日，我們要提高社會的警覺性，重視兒童，保障兒童，要敎養兒童，培育兒童，使能獲得健全的成長，蔚爲國家的幹部，完成建國大業。</p>
<p>（二）紀念兒童節要、永保世界和平</p>
<p>在這全世界烽熖甫息，瘡痍滿目的今日，整個人類所蘄求的是全世界的永久和平。八年來的慘痛經騐吿訴我們，惟有和平纔有希望，纔有幸福，否則，只有痛苦，只有毁滅，永久的和平如何獲得？獲得後又如何保障？我們以爲最澈底最根本的辦法，是從培育兒童入手。對兒童用敎育的力量，來消除他們的侵略思想，用保健的力量，來增强他們的自衛能力，俾整個的民族能繁榮滋長，一方面根除其侵略，殘殺，報復，破壞的思想，一方面養成其仁愛，和平，抑强，扶祝，互助，建設的美德，俾仳界各民族能普遍發展，共存共榮，好平自易實現。希望今後各國，都能本一此精神，來敎育兒童，互相督勉，則彼此屠殺，循環報復的心理將必消弭，天下一家，大同之治的理想世界，可期見諸實現了。在紀念兒童節的今日，希望全國做父母，師長，及一切負有敎育保育之責的，都要以此自勉互勉</p>
<p>我們既知道今年紀念兒童節意義的重大，就應該對於兒童福利事業，加倍努力，但是兒童福利，範圍很廣，我們應該從那一方面來努力去做呢？茲謹就當前環境的需要，指出最重要的兩點，申述如下：</p>
<p>（甲）復員工作注重兒童。，勝利後第一件迫切緊要的工作，就是復員，藉使八年顚沛飽受痛苦的人民，得以休養生息，恢復國家元氣。可是復員工作中，應以兒童的復員爲更重要，因爲今日的兒童，在抗戰開始時，尙係髫齡孺子，八年以來，少小離家，流亡顚連，失掉父母的愛護，缺乏正常的敎養，其身心各方面所受的戕害，較一般成人允甚，亟須要恢復正常生活，重獲家庭溫暖，使能在雍穆安靜的環境中，滋長發育，因之一切復員工作，一應以兒童爲主要對象。關於善後救濟物資的配給，也應該儘先讓兒童享受，不但流落後方的兒童，要儘先讓他們重返家園，與親重聚，獲得正常安定的生活，就是收復區內兒童的救濟，敎育感化等問題，也都是常前兒童福利的重要問題。我們紀念兒童節，不僅是在形式上年年如此這般的虛應故事，更是要針對當前這些重要問題，想出計劃，拿出辦法，實地去幹。</p>
<p>（乙）擴大範圍積極保健與保障：戰事結束之後，有許多雖童保育院·慈幼院·敎養院等，將因兒童的還家而吿結束。但是這並不是說兒童福利工作範圍的縮小，相反地，戰時兒童保育工作的吿一段落，而其他兒童福利的事業則正待開展。我們從事兒童福利工作的同仁，只怕沒有服務的熱忱與毅力，却不怕沒有工作的機會。不過今後兒童福利工作，必須從積極的保健與保障兩方面着手，譬如保健工作，不僅是爲了診治兒童疾病，來辦理幾個診療所，療養地，就以然滿足，更應該防患未然，設決及一般爲父母的育兒常識，改善整個社會的公共衛生，使兒童根本不受任何疾病的傳染。至於保障方面，社會上一切虐待兒童的惡習，如童工，婢女，童養媳等等，都應該一律剷除，不容存在，再推而廣之，凡社會上一切不合理，不平等，不應該有的現象，都應設法根除，務期老有所終，壯有所用，幼有所長，鰥寡孤獨廢疾者皆有所養，使整個的社會，充滿着幸福，和睦，平等，自由，親愛的氣氛，變成一個美滿理想的社會、這是有待於從事兒童福利及一切社會工作者所應常努力的。</p>
<p>戰時兒童救濟敎養工作，建立了中國兒童福利事業的基礎，勉盡了培育民族幼苗的責任。這種對於國家民族的貢獻，是不可漠視的。木人站在中華慈幼協會會長的立塲，謹向全國慈幼同志，深表欽慰敬佩之忱。此後兒童福利事業的開展與艱鉅，將上百倍於今日，希望全國同胞在耙念勝利後第一閃兒童節的今天，專認淸這種慈幼事業的責任，請大家熱烈贊助，盡力倡導，又完成培育兒童，復與已族的使命。</p>

<p>又訊，據米市場息，昨日本市計到白粳等八　，共八千八百餘石，計白粳四〇二五石，　稻一八七二石，早稱一四七〇石，羊秈三一〇石，杜秈六四一石，蕪秈四〇石，白元二九五石，陰元二〇六石。</p>
<h3>溫州龍井獻新開價之巨可驚</h3>
<p>查專銷國內本街及咨帮一帶之旗槍綠茶，俗謂龍井，歷年去化為數不惡。按明前新貨，木當早日登場，惜今年在新茶甫將生產之際，天時未見和緩，且以　雨纏綿不絕，因此產量大為減少，而一切繳用甚大，故茶農成本相當昂貴，茲悉產地消息，溫州明前新　業已上市，俟船期相近，即可運滬，惟所開價格，殊足驚人，潮貨每担叩三萬元，再經焙製後、連裝運悉滬之水脚等費，每担成本至少須達廿六七八萬元左右，至於雨前，溫杭等地不久均將次第戲新云。</p>
<h3>中砂白疲跌</h3>

<h3>紡建提前開貨紗價起而復落</h3>
<p>昨日紗市欲漲無力，晨初廿支各牌曾一度喊高二三萬，然成交不多，旋因紡建公司宣佈提前標售，改於昨午掛牌，致人心忽軟，價遂支持不住而下降，閩粵兩帮略有辦去，收市價與上日相仿，紡建昨標售價格又較上期減低二萬至十五萬。以六十支貶價最多云。</p>
<h3>現棉交易清淡</h3>
<p>昨日紐約美棉漲七至十四磅音，計近期美金二七，八六，遠期二七，九三，米特林現貨二八，四六，本埠現棉交易仍鮮起色，緣黃金與股票無甚發展，紗布市況亦軟，是以各方觀望者多，紡建公司及民營紗廠均懷觀望，僅花號稍有點綴交易，計做開米特林價七萬八至八萬元，又餘姚花價八萬元，以上均棧交價云。</p>
<h3>簍炭到五萬担松柴到貨亦湧</h3>
<p>近半月來自溫州黃　兩地運滬簍炭，及來自杭州之松些，頗絡繹於途，據非正式估計，半月來運滬簍炭，約達五萬五六千簍以上，皆係裝火型帆船運來，每艘約裝數量在萬簍及五千簍上。至於杭州松柴即裝滬杭火東運滬，故本市柴炭存底漸見增加。煤球市價仍昂，頂貨每担零售達一萬三四千元之鉅。</p>

<h3>裝載奢侈品洋輪海關未許進口</h3>
<p>海關輸入品管理　，於三月底公布禁止十九種奢侈品進口，據悉現停留於吳淞口外裝有該項物品之海輪數艘，雖於該項禁令公布之前抵滬，惟亦受影響，不能靠崖卸貨，故經營該業之進口商異常焦妁，現正向江海關進行交涉，若無桔果，恐將原船折返。</p>
<h3>西洪行情續漲</h3>

<h3>逢高即有供售金價不易抬頭</h3>
<p>烚赤昨經前日銀錢業逢低購買後，（黃金有可做抵押訊）昨日買氣續殷，但高價仍難持久，中途多盤，股票疲後又復蠶動，持有者又起脫金換股之風，終稍回跌，晨開即承前晚餘風，破入一五大關，開後續挫，在一四七萬掙扎，銀錢幫之擁有餘資者，紛紛吸收，一般借金購股者亦有所補進，曾盤漲至一五五萬以上，但因一六〇萬之價，中行配售，短時期中必無變更，投機性之買戶，仍乏興趣，不進則退，高後不久又復降落，此後華股死灰復燃，金市來源復多，午刻再退入一五〇萬大關，午後形勢平靜，證券幫為抵補股票收貨銀根，仍有供售，未能振作，結果較前收回降五萬，飾金十六萬五，紋銀一千，銀元一〇五〇元有資，暗拆供求均衡，自一角六分至二角不等。</p>

<h3>香港漸復原狀</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓二日電〕據商務部國際貿易處昨日所接得之報告，最近數月來香港財政，商業與旅行之情形，均己漸見改善，港島現已開放正常貿易，但對於供應缺乏之日用品，則在例外，香港政府官員希望能儘速更進一步寬放貿易之限制，戰前港島原為一完全自由之貿易港，在目前之章程下，貨物輸入，必須獲得二種許可證，第一進口商須向港鳥財政部申請購買外匯之許可證，申請批准後，再向香港海關請求第二許可證，目下香港最需要之貨物為糧食·衣着·建築材料·木材及藥物，輸入奢侈品之美元外匯申請，往往被拒絕，自去年十一月以來，倫敦方面已在考慮以前香港各商行職員之返歸辦法，迄彼時為止，僅有銀行家及與工業機關如公用事業等有關之聯合國人民得重返港島，香港軍政府發言人稱，香港政府一俟情形許可時，即將交還非軍人當局，港島所用之法幣為匯豐銀行·麥加利銀行及有利銀行所發行之鈔票，目下美金一元合港幣九元二角五分二。</p>

<h3>蘇北人民向和平神默禱　熱望淮陰組澈底成功</h3>
<p>— 南通三月廿八日通訊　姚葳寄</p>
<p>在作年苦戰後的今天，被磨難得够了的人們，誰都企望着勝利的光輝能普照到每個角落。和平的溫暖撫慰着每個人的心胸，再不見兵戈的影兒，填塞在秀麗的山水間，再木開槍砲的聲浪，寗澈在柔和的市聲交響曲裏，誰不企求？除非他不是人？誰願意內亂？除非他是吃人成性的野獸！</p>
<p>然而，勝利來到，已經是七個多月，哀鴻遍野，盡是有家歸不得的流亡人，我們要和平，投們要安居樂業，於是，在軍事調處執行部和平小組出發各地視察的消息發出後，誰都把這希望，不，兌熱望．寄託在他們的身上。</p>
<p>徐州小組淮陰組，是全國十七個小組中的一個，組成的分子和其他小組相同，政府，中共和美國三方面代表組成的，計美方代表鄧克中校，政府代表為蕭鳳岐上校，楊超上校，王富榮少校，共軍代表為新四軍華中區副參謀長韓念龍上校，嚴振恒中校，蔣克定中校，還各附帶有隨員，翻譯等，共計十餘人，他們的行　是這樣的，除去原在淮陰的中共代表而外，全體人員均在三月八日集中淮陰，住六日，十一日出發到寶應，高郵，即住高郵，次日至興化，十三日至東台，十四日至如奉停二日，十七日至白蒲，十八日至南通，到記者執筆的今天（二十八日）尚未離開南通。</p>
<p>調處經過</p>
<p>從淮險開始，首先由中共提第一號備忘錄，因為不能獲得政府方面的同意，所以就開始了寶地考察，因此正式的調處談話，小組會議就沒有開始過，同時，因為調處的原則是根據軍事調處執行部的停戰命令和字第二號第二條內所規定：「凡甲方所駐城市，乙方應離六十華里」，但是因為共軍進駐地點雖離此項規定很遠，所以雖然政府方面一再讓步，也不能有迅速談話接近的可能，同時基於談話的誠意，雙方成分不同。也就不能有圓滿的結果。自然，在這裏最重要的，是屬於折衷者的美方代表，但是據記者所知道的，就是他只能分別的在政府方面或是中共方面獲得一方面的希望，而這兩種希望配合起來，距離往往很遠，假如說，絕對根據原則調處，自然這在處於斡旋地位的盟友是很易於辦理的，困難的就在於原則還是原則，事實是事實。因此，在調處方面說，記者只能說是有這麼一個經過，却不能說半點成果。可是到南通為止，這只是淮陰組所經過的第一個難題，在南通而後，還有海門，不有泰興，靖江，泰縣，揚州等許多地方，如果他們不衝破這第一道難關，達到和平的境域，他們將怎樣繼續這調處工作呢？據雙方代表說：「誰都負不了責，得向上峰請示」！可憐治途祈禱和平的老百姓，是怎樣把熱顆的心獻給小組，他們無次數的請願，無限的血寫的現實，請求着和平天使的小組獲得答覆，但是，可能嗎？這霉雨連綿的春日，真的永遠帶給我們哭喪着的臉，灰黯的氛圍，泥潭的途程嗎？</p>
<p>備忘錄捃華</p>
<p>在淮陰，首由中共所提出的第一號的備忘錄，內容計三條，是關於如皋和南通中點的白蒲鎮的進駐問題，按白蒲鎮目前屬於政府軍駐在地，中共的希望是：「請即令進佔五十里以北及白蒲鎮之國軍立即退出平潮以北及白蒲鎮，撤回南通原防」，也就是說使國軍只能駐在南通的城區，也就是說，只能存在一例「點」的控制，自然，在政府方面是不容易接受的。</p>
<p>到如皋棧，政府方面，如皋縣政府提出第一號備忘錄，除去對於據點爭取的記述外，在要求事項上，大約有二，（一）如皋交還政府辦理復員，（二）釋放前如皋縣長及縣府工作人員，（三）不得再征收公糧拒用法幣，並應即停止抗幣及自製郵票之使用等，這幾點要求，乃是基於若干事實而來。茲先將前如皋縣長彭復中到如皋復員及被俘的經過，擇略記述如下：自勝利來臨後，彭縣長於卅四年九月十四日至如皋復員，十六日始接收視事，而郊外槍聲密集，交通斷絕，共軍即開始射擊，如皋守城駐軍是該縣保安團及第二路之獨立第一旅，為自衛而還擎，至二十一日，共軍再增援，有日俘之部隊及偽軍猛攻，即於是日下午一時許破城而進，因之，彭前縣長以下縣府工作人昌泰半被俘。</p>
<p>再次是現駐南通政府部隊向執行小組所提的備忘錄，乃是為中共部隊違反停戰命令，攻佔靈甸港，襲繫白蒲鎮，封鎖物資，阻撓交通而作的報告，其布望大約如次：（一）恢復南通至海門父通，因海通公路沿途駐有共軍，到處騷擾，以至交通斷絕，（二）取銷物資封瑣，共軍對佔領區的物資多行凍結，嚴禁民眾物資運出共軍防區，以至南通海門物價飛漲，而糧食燃料更形奇缺，（三）請令共軍澈底服從停戰命令，不得再有類似攻陷地方部隊所守之靈甸港等行為，（四）共軍應撒退南通自蒲鎮海門之包圍，共軍對海門南通白蒲等處早已完成包圍態勢，並步步進迫，（五）交還靈甸港，查靈甸港在停戰協定前即非共軍控制地區，此次啟東縣府因辦理復員工作，深恐進駐啟東縣治引起衝突，故而暫駐海門邊界之靈甸港，而共軍即進行攻擊，且猛烈攻陷，這一項備忘錄，可說大部基於共軍的不恪遵停戰命令。</p>
<p>南通縣政府提出的備忘錄第一號，在軍隊駐在地，有所要求，（一）共軍退出南通縣城六十華里以外，即共軍態遵守停戰命令和字第二號退出劉橋，石港，金沙，二甲鎮，張芝山，茅鎮等地，（二）南通城外六十里內，為政府軍隊活動區域，共軍不得再來滋擾，（三）六十里交界處，作為緩衝地帶，行政治安問題，應由雙方協商辦理，幣制准通用中央法幣，貨物進出，應准交流，雙方不得封鎖。其次為修復通海公路及釋放政府工作人員（按共軍前後逮捕政府所任命之鄉保長鄉隊附等十餘名）。</p>
<p>人民呼聲</p>
<p>第一件是如皋縣人民團體的報告書，其中列述：一，共產軍對待人民之罪行，二，彭縣長在如皋復負時被俘之經過，三，白蒲復員的經過情形，四，停戰命令下達後，共產軍襲擊白蒲的情形。五，停戰命令下達後，共軍擾亂地方的情形。六，揭發共產黨脅迫民眾要求「解放白蒲」之奸謀等終，極為詳盡，為篇幅所限不能完全寫出以盡報道之責。現僅就其請願希望寫述如後：立即釋放三十四年九月二十一日被捕之彭賑長及縣府工作人負，二，立即釋放被捕之如皋縣士紳。三，立即停止馬塘，掘港間共產黨查封國民黨之財產，並發還已被查封及勒索之人民財產。四，不得封鎖物資，强征公糧。五，立即恢復交通。六，不得拒用法幣。七，如皋必須復員。八，共軍應撤出如縣皋境。九，不得非法逮描人民。</p>
<p>其次為南通縣第一區民眾代表四千人之簽名蓋章的請願備忘錄內容有十餘要點，大意也是恢復交通，解除南通糧草之封鎖厲行停戰命令和字第二號等，總之，是以安居樂業為主。</p>

<h3>參政會十八次會議通過軍事報告決議案</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶二日電〕參政會一日第十八次會議時，通過對軍事報告之決議案，全文如下：本會審查行政院工作報告中軍政一項，並聽取該部之口頭報告，獲悉軍政當局予受降，　俘，軍隊復員整編與改善待遇等事項均己擬有計劃，逐步實施，同人欣慰之餘，尚有不能已於言者，特　陳意見如左：</p>
<h3>迅速遣返日俘考核收繳物資</h3>
<p>（一）敵俘應速遣送回國，敵俘在中國境內不下一百餘萬，除已遣送返國者外，為數尚多，值此糧食恐慌之際，不宜令此等日俘常留國內，虛耗民食，應請政府迅予遣送回國。（二）收徵敵軍物資應有考核，自敵軍投降以後，政府派遣之接收人員，其奉公守法，克盡　職者，固不乏人，而一般現象，則弊端百出，紛擾滋甚，內中軍政接收人員，亦非盡係束身自愛之士，每多貽人口實之處，軍政當局對於各軍接收之物資種類數目及保管與使用之情形，實應嚴加考核。對於舞弊人員，並應依法懲治，以明賞罰。軍風紀之整飭，為整軍建軍之要着，軍政當局勵精圖治，當於此中求其績效。</p>
<h3>簡化軍事機構安置編餘官兵</h3>
<p>（五）軍事行政機構應再力求簡化，機關分　，　　不一，為行政之能病，軍事機構亦蹈此弊，往往與有關機關不相連繫，影響效率，莫此為　，政府終此業已有所改進，尤宜對重疊之軍政機構更予簡化，以收統一强化之效。（四）軍隊復員應與國家建設配合，戰後大軍分期復員解甲之官兵，將有數百萬人如何安置，應與國家建設計劃相配合，如某地治河修路，即將某地之編餘官兵加以訓練，使之從事此等工作，不宜另募民夫，使編餘官兵尚須別謀安頓，各不相謀。至根本之圖，尤在迅即舉辦各種建設事業與官兵生計同時兼顧，而社會隱患，亦可頓以消弭。</p>
<h3>健全征兵制度研究軍事學術</h3>
<p>（五）整軍完成後之常備軍應依兵役法征集壯丁就役整軍後之常備軍額數較少，當按兵役法規定征集，為征兵之示範，不可遷就一時之便利，仍行招募，使征兵制度永不能健全樹立。（六）新武器及軍事學術，研究應力謀邁進中國軍隊不惟裝備不完，而武器與學術尤為落後，應就教育訓練兵工各方面亟圖邁進，以期追蹤先進國家。（七）榮譽軍人應妥予安置榮譽軍人為國犧牲，功在國家，政府對其復健回籍就業，以及撫恤等，應妥籌完善辦法，俾能各得其所，以示國家崇德報功之意。</p>
<h3>建設空海兩軍安定社會秩序</h3>
<p>（八）空海軍建設應即從事整備現代化之軍事陸海空軍，同其重要，我國陸軍建設已具規模，今後應予整編陸軍，增進其實力之外，同時力謀空軍之充實與海軍之創立，以期國防建設齊頭並進。猶有進者，本會議以為：軍政建設幾於國家社會秩序之安定，交通之恢復與大　令之統一，而國共兩軍之停止衝突，尤為先決之條件，現國軍已遵令停戰，而共軍圍城略地，仍復　不絕　，長此推　，影響軍政建設大計實　　　，切盼政府迅謀妥善解決之道，出人民於水火，使軍政建設計劃亦得以順利實施，國家幸甚。</p>
<p>偉大和平使者馬帥專機全貌</p>
<p>偉大和平使者馬歇爾元帥，前為調處各地軍事問題，曾搭專機分赴主要地點，翼不停飛，厥功甚偉，我全國上下均表感謝。</p>
<h3>寓勸業於遊春　蓉城三月花會　青羊宮二仙庵盛况</h3>
<p>— 成都三月廿八日航訊　周泱泉寄</p>
<p>三月的成都，是一個花的城市。臘梅謝了，桃花又開，桃花謝了，薔薇盛開，尤其是最近，正是城西花會熱鬧的時節。</p>
<p>說起成都的分組會，已有幾千年的歷史，傳自唐末及前後蜀，相沿至今，直到光緒三十二年，當道為提倡工商業，才改名「勸業會」。因緣舊俗，改由官府負責，徵集各縣產品，陳列其中，在散會時評定甲乙，頒給獎章，以資鼓勵，這實在是很有意義的集會。抗戰期間，也曾有過一兩次大規模的舉行，其餘的幾年都是人民自動的聚合，規機很小，尤以去年最為冷淡，參與的各業，大都是折本而回，今年由成都市政府監督管理，想來再不會使人民掃興吧。</p>
<p>會場設在新西門外一里許的青羊宮和二仙庵的裏裏外外，全面積約佔地五十畝左右，以每方丈最高八千六百元和最低四千元的代價，租給商人，他們可以因自己的需要定承租多少，再加上萬元的搭蓬費，就可以做短期的生意了。</p>
<p>小型臨時社會</p>
<p>據負責人的統計：參加此次花會的各種門類，小食店一百餘家，茶社五十听，劇院和遊藝場七處，玩具店五十家，紙烟舖二百餘處，木器竹器店六十餘家，瓷器十餘家，花圃四十餘家，及其他零星雜物業百餘家，這裏真是一個臨時的小型社會，他們從幾百幾千里外趕來參加，賺利只是參與的一小部份目的，因為在成都，俗尚遊樂，遊樂的成分却超過了賺錢的成分！在會場的中央，有市府的招待處，那是勸業會的行政中樞。他們分衛生·徵築·場地·總務及交際各組，負責進行管理這個大會場，（其實是商場）至於警衛和消防，却另成立了軍警憲聯合指揮處統籌管理。</p>
<p>摸青羊治百病</p>
<p>舉行開幕禮那天，適逢香期（廢歷月半）那些善男信女，成羣結隊的從各地集來，兩個廟裏，香烟繚繞，燭光融融，他（她）們爭先恐後的膜拜，尤其踴擠的是那兩隻銅製青羊，被人們摸得金光閃爍。據傳，摸青羊，可除百病，頭痛摸頭，腿痛摸腿，這是多麼可笑而又可憫的愚行喲！</p>
<p>勸業功效尚微</p>
<p>風和日暖，在中午時分，從四鄉八鎮，聚攏千千萬萬的老少男女，趕熱鬧，找樂趣，幾條窄狹的人行道上，真是擠得水洩不通，人們像永流一樣，一浪趕着一浪，可以十足看出成都人對於遊樂的興味來。他們穿上過新年的禮服，他們不吝惜的用錢，換取各自的享受，雖然市府當局宣佈他們是寓勸業於遊樂，可是對於勸業的功效似乎太微薄了。</p>
<p>花車飛遍街巷</p>
<p>成都市自來水公可與省立實騐小學合鑄一套自來水的出水過程模型，該是會場中最特色的陳列品。至於工業館裏的各縣土產品和嘉華水泥廠的成品展覽，也為大會生色不少。那些「溫江豆油」，「鄲縣豆瓣」，洞子口掠粉」。「新都葉兒粑」和「仁壽麻餅」等，更是到處向着雇客們撒着笑臉！</p>
<p>當日落西山的時候，遊客們差不多每個都愛拿着花紙風車，拖着沉重身子歸去，於是在大街小巷裏，處處飄着花車，任春風擺佈。這個集會，一直要延長到廢曆三月底，才又漸漸散去。（廿八日）</p>

<h3>為金山嘴危塘作緊急呼籲！</h3>
<p>— 侯無忌</p>
<p>吾松江金山嘴海塘，自民國二十三年修築後，殊稱堅固，迨抗戰開始，金山嘴一帶為敵寇登陸之處，年來塘身剝蝕甚烈，復以潮水朝夕沖刷，迄今險象叢生，最後之防禦（石塘）亦已顯露。究其後果，實有不堪設想者！</p>
<p>溯自敵寇乞降，松屬有識之士，亟亟以趕修金山嘴危塘為先務，第念國力維艱，恐未如願。後聞救濟署蘇寧分署函松江救濟協會令迅速趕修，一切經費統由蘇軍分署撥付，逖聞之下。雀耀再三，惟近悉其工事僅「填土」一項而已！故不得不作緊急呼籲於袞袞諸公及社會賢達。</p>
<p>查民二十三年海塘修築，其工程為坦坡拋石式，一橋一石式，二樁二石式，三樁三石式等，第亦視其危象之輕重而施之，從未以「填土」為永逸者。茲以刧後餘生，興修海塘，衹以「填土」而畢其事，任何人皆以為不然。蓋不抵潮汐一日之冲毀也！至於此次搶修費用，既由救濟分署撥付，則機會之佳，莫過於此，宜如何堅固工事，以垂久遠，「填土」乃挖肉補瘡耳！若論金山嘴危急現狀，比之民二十三年實尤過之，一經實地視察，毛髮為之悚然。甚願諸公飭令剋日開工，以堅固工事，消弭此絕大危險，否則一旦出險，較海寧塘決，實有天壤之別。</p>
<p>抑尤有言者，轉瞬霉汎即屆，證諸往年，常有颶風侵襲，彼濤山傾，挾以俱來，生命懸如危卵。驚心動魄，莫甚於此。故必須於霉汎前竣工，毋使海寧出險於前，金山嘴緊隨於後也。至於應擇何種工事，自是技師之責任，為吾民生命計，地方安全計，自應急切呼籲蘇寧分署及社會賢達之同情，俾獲早日完成防災之工作。</p>

<h3>兒童健康比賽與身體檢查</h3>
<p>— 蘇會祥</p>
<p>蘇會祥女醫師是留德的小兒科專家，醫治小兒疾病，經驗至為　當。最近已由本市衛生局任命為「上海市立兒童醫院」院長，對於本市兒童健康，必可有一番新貢獻。今天兒童節得蘇院長特為本報作此文，殊　榮幸。—編者</p>
<p>勝利後的第一個兒童節，大家特別高興，所以市政府，衛生局，市黨部，婦女運動委員會……等團體聯合舉辦了一個兒童健康比賽。為的是要促進民衆對於兒童健康的注意，同時穩固國家基礎，用意至為深長。</p>
<p>十年前中　　幼協會和新新公司都舉辦兒童健康比賽。在抗戰期間，女青年曾每逢兒童節也都舉行兒童健康比賽。會祥沗為小兒科醫師，曆年至今，都去義務檢查並作評判，在我是義不容辭很高興的一件事情，因此在兒童健康比賽方面，得到了一點小小的經驗。</p>
<p>據我看來，舉辦健康坒得和參與比賽的人，目的似乎並不完全相同。看看檢查的表格，即詳且盡，從皮膚至內臟，從頭檢查兒童有病無病，而並不在於給獎。但是參與比賽者的父母，十之八九為的是要得獎。常見一家人家，有四五個小孩，特別把有得獎希望的挑出來參加比賽，至於那些傎傎需要檢查身體的，反而放在家裏。刻前年女青年曾有一位先生說，我們要來一個「不健康」比賽。　就是因為有所感而說的，覺得既然化了許多時間精神和金錢，就應當做到能夠收　最大的成果。</p>
<p>因此我覺得健康比賽與身體檢查是兩件事。照目前的情形，在兒童節這一天，除了舉行兒童健康比賽以外，應該同時在全國的機構，限令全國兒童都應在一定的期限之內，由醫師作週密的身體檢查，見識在這時期內查出有疾病的，由國家為之半　或免費診治，以求優待。如果能夠這樣辦到的話，則五年之後，全國民眾的健康智識，必可　　提高，全國兒童的健康，必可為之改進。這樣一來，二十年之後，我們就不難把「東亞病夫」的恥辱洗刷淨盡，也可以永久保持這個光榮的勝利了！</p>
<p>兒童</p>
<h3>我替兒童申訴　—兒童節正告社會人士—</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>對於勝利後第一次的兒童節，我不想寫「兒童節的意義」或「兒童節感言」一類的應時文　。但却抑不住我滿腔的情感，要替純潔天傎的兒童們向社會人士申訴。</p>
<p>我想誰都不能否認，我們的社會對於兒童的待遇實在太不合理。我們中國的兒童至少有大半以上度着極悲慘的生活。他們沒有獨立的權利，只是成人們的附庸，孩子出生以後所經過的一段需要敎養的長時期，差不多完全交托給　般不懂敎養方法的愚昧昏庸的父母。當然我們也不能說沒有開明賢良的父母，能負擔培育子女的責任，可是那終究少得很。除去極幸運的兒童外，都沒有接受適宜的敎養的　會。最可寶貴的童年時期，便在　不見陽光的陰　面度過了。</p>
<p>現在世界各國對　幼的法律，都有明文規定，目的無非在保障兒童的權利，使下一代民族國家的後　者獲得合理的保育。像英美和蘇聯，他們的兒童福利事業都由國家經營，而腐　士以於慈幼工作的努力，更不能不令我們欽佩。可是，反觀我國，法律上雖確定兒童的權利，但社會上一般人仍然以漠然的態度對付兒童。虐待兒童的事簡直司空見慣，父母可以把子女當作洩氣的工具，而隨便打罵，商店的學徒常常在老板　酷的淫威下遭受鞭撻，十五六歲發育還未健全的兒童，為了生活從事拉車的職業，而不為當局禁阻。以上海敎育文化甲於全國的都市，溺嬰的惡習還時有所聞，而不算犯罪。據統計報告販賣人口的案件，以兒童佔大半，社會上如此剝奪兒童們的生存權利，起起來傎令人不寒而憟。</p>
<p>現在歐美諸先進國，倡導「父母敎育」不遺餘力，希望每個做父母的人都具備敎養兒童的知能，用客觀的科學態度，解決兒童生理上心理上的重要問題。我國近年來雖亦已接受到這種進步的思想，然而還夠不上普及。一般做父母的人，依舊拿傳統的不合理的方法敎育兒童，（與其說是敎育兒童，不如說是管兒童。）這般愚昧無知的父母，首先對父母子女的關係就沒有正確的認識，把子女看做是私有的，不知道他們或她們是一員，有着確定的社會地位。人家根據心理衛生的原則訓練兒童，以積趨的暗示和鼓勵矯正兒童的不良習慣，從身心發展的狀態，　傳，環境等方面去研究兒童的思想和行為，而我們號稱五千年文明的古國，大多數的父母，非但不能給子女們以適宜的「愛」，反而從種種方面傷害兒童們稚弱的心靈。　羈，體罰，訶斥，　刺成為敎育兒童的主要手段，他們從不想到這些都是消極的無效的方法，同時也是最不合理最不開明的方法。對於保育衛生，醫藥，康藥等重要問題，自然更不是那般愚昧的父母所能了解，於是他們子女的幸福便在無形中彼　　了。至於一段自認為新女性的，她們又把敎養孩子的事委託給婢僕，子女們根本受不到良好的培育。在嚴屬的敎羈，體罰，訶責的另一面，又常見過於溺愛子女的現象，兒童們被一味的驕生慣養，造成以後適應生活的困難。</p>
<p>八年的抗戰，許多兒童推動生活的憑依。前日報載，目下有數百萬流浪兒童，在生死線上掙扎，　待設法救濟。這又使我們想到極嚴重的兒童犯罪問題。兒童得不到社會家庭和學校良好的敎養，勢必走上犯罪之路，而我國對於兒童罪犯的處置和成人同樣看待，影響他們的身心實在很大。像歐美諸國，現在都有「兒童罪犯感化所」的設施，專門對犯罪行為的兒童予以積極的敎化。而我國却沒有這種合理的組織，偶犯罪過便被禁閉到獄中去，與成年罪犯雜處一起，再接受他們的不良暗示，造成進一步的墮落。現在既有這樣多的兒童　於死亡，流亡他鄉，如從速籌謀有效的救濟方法，這數百萬兒童不是死亡殆盡，便將成為罪犯的後補者。英國在這次大戰中，每於各地準備軍事行動前先將兒童向郊外疏散，美國在戰時對兒童的安全保障推行亦頗周到，但我們的國家對於改善主不關心。大多數的流浪兒童，再不適當的處置，那就不　無故的把民族生命的幼芽摧殘了。再如這些兒童因敎養不善而渝於罪犯，到那時我們的良心將受到嚴重的證實：誰使這些無辜的兒童犯罪？誰負擔這些兒童道德墮落的責任？</p>
<p>兒童安全和健康上的威脅，也是很嚴重的。一般學校並不能供給兒童一個合理的生活環境，讓兒童生活在光線不足空氣沈濁的地方，健康敎育和衛生設施的標準都差得很，以致兒童脆弱的身心，常易傳染疾病。即以上海一地而論，學校兒童體格贏弱的佔百分之六十以上，這是衛生當局的統計，恐怕實際上百分比還要超過。走進「弄堂學校」去看一下，設備的不合衛生原則，簡直不能想像。至於校外的生活整天在馬路上溜跶，或是坐在街沿下看「小書」，從意識不純正的連環間實義接受之神怪淫誨的毒素，　對身心的影響都很不好。社會上缺少專門供給兒童遊樂的場所，健全的精神生活（包括文化生活）固然缺乏，而安全的問題也很嚴重，看了人家到處設立的兒童公園，兒童運動場，兒童圖書館，以及其他種種兒童福利事業，我們作何感想！為了兒童們身心的迫切需要，為了拯救他們身體上和精神上所遭受的苦痛，我不得不在這裏替他們申訴！</p>
<p>我首先要求社會人士要改變傳統的對兒童的態度，不可再認視比什麼還重要的兒童的敎養。我們必須尊重兒童獨立的人格和權利。「二十世紀是兒童的世紀」，我們應認清愛偷凱這句話的傎義。兒童不是縮小的成人，他們應該有他們活動的天地，我們不能以消極的禁阻來妨礙他們身心的正常發展，我們更不能以打罵，體罰，訶責種種不合理的懲誠方法，來摧殘他們身心的健康，剝奪他們天賦的權利。拿成人的判斷，習慣和思想來期望兒童，無論如何是不對的。</p>
<p>我們還希望法律上對兒童的保障不成為一紙具文，要希望兒童福利事業的推進有有顯著的成效，必須將社會人士過去對兒童錯誤的觀念完全矯正過來，同時，家庭和學校取得實切的聯絡，共同負担起保育兒童敎養兒童的責任，社會上的開明人士，賢良的父母，前進的敎師能共同協力，培育未來的「社會的一員」灌溉民族的新鮮細胞，那麼中國的前途才有復興之　！</p>

<h3>自製小工褲</h3>
<p>— 蔫淑芳</p>
<p>愛美是一種天性。尤其是女孩子們，當她們上學時，總喜歡自己穿的衣裳比別人的孩子們好看特別。有錢的人不必說，他們要什麼都可以去賣，但普通一般人就辦不到。我們為什麼不利用開睱自己去做呢？孩子們一定也特別喜歡自己母親手製的美術化的衣裳。</p>
<p>圖中的尺寸（英尺）合適於五六歲小女孩穿的。</p>
<p>材料：最好是呢絨料，可以利用舊旗袍或裙子改做，或是普通堅固的面料均可。</p>
<p>製法：依圖中尺寸剪裁，先縫好褲身，前面安上胸　，後面褲腰處加寬緊帶穿起來比較包身，且旁邊不用開口釘扣，穿脫比較方便，再加上褲帶即成。最要緊的是找點奇特的花樣鎖在胸前及口袋上，使整條褲子煥然一新，與市上買的就兩樣了。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>用國力舉辦托兒所　女職員的呼籲</h3>
<p>— 一沫</p>
<p>家用的一個女僕，姓許氏的，職務是為我帶孩子，前些時職工回去，原因是　的孩子出天花死了，當她哭喪着臉向我辭工的時候，我傎埋怨天道無憑，陪着淚不知用什麼方法去安慰她，唉！誰也珍愛自己的孩子「舍巴之田而耘人之田」，結果如此，怎不叫人同情？</p>
<p>原來她是因饑餓拋別孩子，而我則因公務關係不能照顧孩子。環境所迫，各有苦衷。由此我就想起了蘇聯的托兒制度，實在是其國力的泉源。考蘇聯革命距今不過廿十八年；而其今日多少人才，多為當年托兒所的出品。她今日的舉足輕重，實非偶然。所以我們今日取人之長以補已之所短，趕快抓住現實以創造將來。</p>
<p>我現在是兩個孩子—雙包胎—的母親。因為是郵局的一個小職員，每日有八小時的工作。孩子的事，簡直是委諾女僕。，試問終日與女僕廝混　的孩子，影響怎樣？「染於蒼則蒼，染於黃則黃」，結果不但智識方面得不到長進，相反的反學會多少惡習慣；養成一些壞脾氣；護理方面，更加談不到了。誰也想望自己的孩子好，體力智力與日俱增。可是在這種情形下，為母親的，有什麼辦法？除「鞠躬盡瘁」外，只有付之懊喪。常講的，孩子是來日的主人翁，而我們這第二代主人翁的保姆，責任的　行，委實夠幸苦了！</p>
<p>時至今日，最多而質不實的中華民族，以年來遭遇的痛苦經驗，關於民族實量方面，應當要改變方針。相定民族的重心，「救救孩子」。不然舍本逐末，縱令我們這一代能旋轉乾坤，　於富強，可是繼承者不肖，仍然不能承先啓後，我們不是徒勞心力嗎？</p>
<p>據說現在已設有托兒所的，只有上海和重慶兩地。這不過是地方人士一時的舉指，少數孩子的幸福。我們希望的，是以國力來舉辦。當然以戰後的國力，百端待舉。我們並不希望一口織普遍設立。但政治漸入正軌，整軍之後，軍費自必減少，何不將這筆節餘開支的一小部份，移作福幼經費？將來由敎育部視地方情形，指定公立學校附設幼稚園托兒所，或由社會部另行辦理，均無不可。事在人為，十年樹木，百年樹人，孩子幸甚！母親幸甚！（却酬）</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>從鼻涕說起</h3>
<p>— 中一</p>
<p>這裏，讓我先告訴你一則笑話。</p>
<p>小咪已經五歲了，但是一些也不懂得整潔，成天拖養兩條質膿鼻涕，簡直揩也不願揩一揩。某天，他的母親說：</p>
<p>「小咪，瞧你弄得多　！快所鼻涕揩掉，等一會媽買糖你吃！」</p>
<p>小咪很「乖」，立刻把鼻涕縮到鼻孔裏去。但是不滿一分鐘，他就　住母親吵着要吃糖！媽輕輕地打了他一個，說：</p>
<p>「你倒傎要吃糖了！我騙騙你呀！」</p>
<p>小咪不吵了，但立即把鼻涕　又淌下來，笑著說：</p>
<p>「我也騙騙你喲！」</p>
<p>先生，你笑了是嗎？不錯，這是一則笑話，然而，與其說它是「笑話」，我以為倒不如說它是「哭話」來得更　實點！</p>
<p>能也不能否認，在中國社會的家庭內，傎能懂得，傎肯研究怎樣去敎導孩子的母親是太缺乏了！普通的一班母親發覺孩子有過誤的時候，不是一味的放縱，便是拼命的打罵，再進一層，有幾位母親竟　脆把子女們全繼託付與僕庸，不管他們東也好，西也好，反正自己是抱定宗旨不　不問！其實，誰都知道，　日地　着「心肝寶貝」而任孩子們「無法無天」是不足取的，同樣地，時常罵他們「小鬼！死人！」或者竟進一步「劈劈拍拍！」鍛煉着他們的　發，也不是辦法；而「爾為爾，我為我」的政策更覺荒乎其　了！然而不幸得很所事實會告訴你，「明知故犯」舊是普遍的現象；大多數母親依採取的方針還是　不出「打」「罵」「旅途一或「不罵不問」的範疇！</p>
<p>雖然，異於上述婁種的方針也並非沒有，譬如說吧，「騙騙你」的手段　非不同凡響？人性是貪的！利用了這「貪」字，你就可以騙人了，母親騙孩子不消說更是易如反掌！糖菓，錢，做新衣服，買洋囡囡……那一件又不能挑動孩子的心呢？於是母親們今天也「騙騙你」明天也「騙騙你」，終於把一個個兒童在長期受騙的環境裏，都鍛煉成推動了天傎無邪的心理而以致「幼年老成」的怪物！他們像小咪那樣，都懂得怎樣去對付人家的騙，怎樣去騙人！換句話說，他們是深通世故了！先生，請你想一想！讓孩子們丟棄了寶貴的「天傎」而在五六歲或者七八歲的時候就「老成」起來，這究竟算是好現象還是壞現象呢？至少，我謬論說這是違背了自然！是嗎？然則，難道我們還預備　　地製造「騙」？製造「笑話」？</p>
<p>不！天下的母親們，為着你們的第二代，為着你們自己，不要再不加考慮地毀壞你們的「製成品」了！採用起正當的誘導方法來敎育你們的子女吧！</p>
<h3>養媳歌</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>「養媳婦，苦弗過；倒拖鞋月　刮婆，隔壁大姥脊不過，做雙鞋子送給我。我日裏搖紗搖到半夜多，肚裏餓弗過，偷些　菜　　肚；巴巴望望個年夜過。」</p>
<p>以上是一首關於童養媳的歌謠。在這首歌謠裏，可以看出一般童媳們所過的是一種怎麼樣的生活。如何剷除中國數千年來　養童媳的陋習？如何改善日前一般童媳的生活？這是注意中國家庭問題者所該研討的一個問題。</p>

<h3>婦女展開社會工作的心理障礙　〔上〕</h3>
<p>— 蕭寀</p>
<p>一般研究婦女問題的人，都覺得覺得婦女不能和男子一樣　開廣大的社會工作，不能以社會事業作為個人終身的事業。不是不能插足進去，就是半途而廢，很少有竭其終生精力，從事於某種事業的。於是乃有人站在男性立場而持一種偏見，以為女子的智　和能力有及男子，天賦的限制合女子只能育兒治家，永遠只能處在被男子支配的地位，持這種見解的如十九世紀大哲學家叔本華等，就是亞裏斯多德也以為女子是不及男子的。他說斯巴達滅亡的原因之一，就是由於女子有繼承遺產權，因為這使她們有極大的獨立權，於是使斯巴達人民陷於不幸的境地。又如近世魔五希特勒極力主張婦女回廚房去，其間雖含有國社黨的政治作用，可是輕蔑婦女人機，剝奪婦女獨立自由的地位和人格，都是同出一轍的認誤。這些見解，到現在已從生理心理方面證明男女兩性沒有天賦優劣的不同，我們也用不着來給這些論　加以辯駁了。因為科學事實的證據，自然是勝於任何雄辯的，然而我們站在女子的立場，對於婦女之不能和男子一樣參與社會工作，展開社會工作，以社會工作作為自己終生事業的事實，却是不能否認的。就目前中國社會情形而言，近年來高等敎育之容許女子得與男子有同等享受的機會，是很普遍的現象，但是傎　正能夠把社會服務作為終生事業的婦女，與受敎育的女子人數相比，雖然目前還沒有人作這項客觀的調查，但是據我們估計，比例數一定是相當小的。那麼婦女對於社會　作之不能夠和男子一樣並駕齊驅，除否認智慧和能力較男子為遜外，還有什麼原因呢？一真到現在為止，男子中心社會的勢力，還極其雄厚的保存着，社會的各部門都仍舊給與女子以種種的阻難，使女子不能和男子一樣自由自在地出入於社會各部門之間，這種社會的阻力，是足以使女子不能和男子一樣展開工作的社會的原因。但是女子之不容易展開社會工作，除了社會的阻力以外，還有婦女本身心理上的原因。此文是撇開社會原因不講，只從心理方面的原因來解釋婦女之所以不能展開社會工作。</p>
<p>我以為心理的原因，是婦女展開社會工作的電大障礙之一。因為假如女子本身傎正是有毅力和勇氣去克服社會的困難的話，那麼社會的阻力將不足以阻止婦女之參加社會事業的，更不足以阻止婦女以社會事業作為終生事業的。婦女心理學專家愛理斯博士曾以為女子是不能夠　克服環境的困難以造成一個培根和易卜生之顯的人物，也就是認為婦女之所以很少有科學家藝術家的原因，還是由於婦女心理上的原因之故。</p>

<h3>Departure Location Still to be Determined; Northeast Mediation Work Difficult; Chen Cheng to Participate in Three Military Groups</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping (Beijing) Office, 3rd] Regarding the allocation of locations for the Northeast Executive Headquarters' groups, the government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have not yet reached an agreement. However, the general consensus is that, in addition to the Jiyang Central Group, Liaoyang, Sipingjie, and Yingkou are all likely locations for dispatching groups.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping (Beijing) Office, 3rd] The Northeast mediation work faces numerous difficulties. Government personnel believe that the only solution is to assist the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) in taking over [territory], which should not affect the NRA's takeover. Rao Rushishi, the CCP's leader in the Northeast Executive Headquarters, stated that both sides' troops must cease troop movements.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping (Beijing) Office, 3rd] The Military Three-Person Group may come to the North soon, and together with Executive Headquarters members Zheng Jiemin, Ye Jianying, and Robertson, will go to the Northeast to give instructions on mediation work.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen announced today that Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng has been appointed by General Zhang Zhizhong as the government representative of the "Military Three-Person Group." The group will hold a meeting at 4:00 PM today to discuss going to the Northeast as soon as possible. However, Wu expressed doubt about Chen Cheng's ability to go to the Northeast due to his poor health. General Zhou Enlai attended the meeting today, accompanied by General Ye Ting, the former commander of the New Fourth Army.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 3rd] The four teams of the Executive Group of the Mediation Executive Headquarters are currently awaiting the definition of their powers in the Northeast. Both the Nationalist and Communist sides seem quite indifferent to them. According to reliable sources, General G. R. Bair, the director of the Executive Group of the Mediation Executive Headquarters, may fly to Changchun to discuss with the Soviet authorities the dispute between the Nationalists and Communists over taking over Changchun after the Soviet troops withdraw. It is believed that the Military Three-Person Group will arrive here next week to give instructions to the local commanders in the Northeast because, as of now, they have not received any instructions on how to treat the Executive Groups going to the Northeast.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 2nd] A small misunderstanding occurred at the airport here today. When the Communist delegation arrived, it was stopped by the NRA and detained for four hours before being cleared up. NRA generals and American representatives repeatedly apologized to the Communist personnel. The misunderstanding was caused by unclear translation of official orders. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, all plainclothes teams on the streets of Changchun, seemingly with New Fourth Army insignia, have now been ordered to withdraw by the Soviet army. The four senior government representatives of the Stop Conflict Group are reported to have arrived in Jinzhou and can arrive here at any time.</p>
<h3>Yingkou, Niuzhuang, Anshan and Four Other Locations; NRA Took Over Successively Yesterday; There are Battles Near Changchun and Qiqihar</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping (Beijing) Office, 3rd] The highest authorities have sent a stern telegram to the Northeast Headquarters, ordering responsible officials of the provinces and cities that have been taken over in the Northeast to remain loyal to their duties under any circumstances and not to retreat without authorization. However, if the situation is absolutely unavoidable, they may retreat with the Soviet army. Currently, the outskirts of Changchun have become chaotic, and Harbin and Qiqihar are also extremely tense. Peng Jiqun, Chairman of Nenjiang Province, and Guan Jiyu, Chairman of Songjiang Province, have repeatedly telegraphed the Northeast Headquarters for emergency assistance.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping (Beijing) Office, 3rd] Personnel from the provinces and cities taken over in Northeast China are now ordered to concentrate in Jinzhou for work. Personnel from various provincial governments remaining in Beiping have departed one after another.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 3rd] In the Liaodong Peninsula, the NRA, overcoming the obstruction of the Communist army, has successively taken over Anshan, Haicheng, Niuzhuang, and Yingkou today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd] The NRA moving north to take over defense yesterday crossed Changtu and reached the vicinity of Sipingjie.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The Communist army, which occupied Datun, 19 kilometers south of Changchun, on the morning of the 1st, continued to advance 11 kilometers north and occupied Mengjiatun at 10:00 PM on the 2nd. Thus, the vanguard of the Communist army advancing north along the Chinese Changchun Railway (later part of the Chinese Eastern Railway) was only 8 kilometers away from the Changchun Railway Station. At around 8:00 PM on the 3rd, the Communist army came to the vicinity of the airport again, and battles were ongoing.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It is learned that, in addition to the Chinese Changchun Railway, 1,900 kilometers of railways in the Northeast have been dismantled, almost equivalent to two Tianjin-Pukou Railways or five Jiaoji Railways. Bridges and warehouses along the routes have also been blown up. Furthermore, it is reported that most of the ships in the Songhua River are missing, totaling about 200 vessels.</p>
<h3>Terentiy Fomich Shtykov Notifies [Date of] Soviet Troop Withdrawal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] When Dong Yanping met with Terentiy Fomich Shtykov at 1:00 PM on the 3rd, Shtykov informed Dong in detail of the dates for the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from various parts of the Northeast, including Changchun, Harbin, Bei'an, and Jiamusi. None of these dates have been officially announced. However, it is learned that the final withdrawal of Soviet troops from Changchun may be after the 10th, and the final withdrawal of Soviet troops from the last location will be April 30th. Today's meeting failed to completely resolve all outstanding issues, so the two agreed to talk again on the 5th. Also, Qiqihar is currently under siege by the Communist army, which is very urgent. Today, Dong informed Shtykov of this matter, and Shtykov still stated that he would be responsible for its safety before the Soviet troops withdraw. It is also learned that Marshal Rodion Yakovlevich Malinovsky is still in Changchun and may leave before all his troops are withdrawn.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Kai declared that the Sino-Soviet Agreement stipulates that the Soviet army should withdraw from the major ports, but there is no information on whether the Soviet army is actually withdrawing. He also said that economic negotiations have not resumed. Liu also admitted that the area currently under the control of the central government in the Northeast is a small part of that vast and important region.</p>
<h3>Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Subcommittee Disagreements; Efforts Made to Mediate by All Parties</h3>

<h3>Wedemeyer Returns to America Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] General Wedemeyer, who has been in China for two years, is scheduled to leave China this morning to return to America. Wedemeyer did not want to be ostentatious, so he told his subordinates not to come to the airport to see him off. Wedemeyer has been fighting alongside the National Army, leading the Allied forces in China, for two years and has made great achievements. In Shanghai in April, he presided over the U.S. Army Headquarters, assisting China's rehabilitation work, which was well received. People from all walks of life feel sorry for Wedemeyer's departure from China and hope that he will stay. After Wedemeyer leaves China, his position will be taken over by General Matteck, Wedemeyer's chief of staff. It is heard that Wedemeyer will take a short rest after returning home, and he himself cannot answer whether he will come to China again. Song Ziwen, President of the Executive Yuan, held a cocktail party at his private residence on West Aims Road yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM to bid farewell to General Wedemeyer. Many Chinese and foreign dignitaries were invited to attend. Yesterday Wedemeyer was also invited to a banquet by Hu Junqiu at Mei Lu. The famous musician Li Weining was also present. At the request of General Wedemeyer, Chang Zhong played his own works, which were truly extraordinary. After appreciating it, General Wedemeyer intends to launch a music festival after returning to China to promote research on music.</p>

<h3>Military Court Established; War Criminals to be Tried Within the Month</h3>

The presiding judge, Shi Meirui, the judges, the prosecutors, and the military legal officers have all been appointed.

<h3>Number of Committee Members Still Under Discussion; Government Reorganization Will Be Delayed; Communist Army Has Not Yet Submitted Registration Forms for Reorganization</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Office, 3rd] Regarding the reorganization of the government, because the various parties have not finished discussing the number of government committee members, there is no progress yet. However, it is rumored that in the future government, Zeng Qi and Fu Sinian will be appointed as the ministers of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education, respectively. [United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] When talking about the three major points of contention between the Nationalists and Communists, Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen said: If the Communists can value their promises, then the Nationalist-Communist disputes may not be resolved. He said: Regarding the reorganization of the National Government, the Communist Party has so far refused to publish a list of members of the National Government Committee. Regarding the Northeast issue, he insisted on the original agreement, that is, the government army can freely enter the Northeast. Regarding the reorganization of the army, Wu said that the government had sent the reorganization numbers to the Communist army for verification on March 25. When asked how the government reacted to the Communist Party's protest against the National Army entering the Northeast on American warships, Wu said: The military commission spokesperson formally denied that the government had sent the 5th Army to the Northeast, and said that the Communist Party distorted the facts to destroy the reorganization agreement and hinder the takeover work. He said that the Communist Party agreed from the beginning, so they are now destroying the agreement. The reorganization plan stipulates that there should be five government armies and one communist army in the Northeast within twelve months. A total of 241,500 National Army troops have arrived in the Northeast or are on their way, while the Communist Party claims to have 300,000 troops, which is ridiculous.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] According to Article 4 of the military reorganization plan, within the specified time limit, the government should prepare a list of the 90 divisions to be retained and the order of demobilization of the troops in the first two months. During the same period, the CCP should prepare a detailed list of its troops, stating their nature, strength, weapons, the names of the commanders above the brigade level, and the locations of each unit, and must include a list of the 18 divisions to be retained and the order of demobilization of the troops in the first two months, etc., and submit them to the military committee. However, despite repeated requests from the committee, the CCP has not yet submitted them. All parties are extremely concerned about this and believe that this is a major test of whether the CCP is sincere in implementing the reorganization plan.</p>
<h3>The First Public Trial of the Major Traitor, Miao Bin, Equivocates, Claiming to Have Been Engaged in "Counter-Espionage Work Against Japan"; Court Orders Sentencing on April 8th</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 10 PM on the 3rd] Miao Di, the pseudo-Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, was awaiting trial in the First Criminal Court of the Jiangsu High Court on the afternoon of the 3rd. At 2 PM, six armed bailiffs dispatched by the High Court went to the Sishiqian Street Detention Center to escort the traitor Miao to the High Court's Third Criminal Defendant Waiting Room. The High Court was heavily guarded that day, with two armed bailiffs stationed at the gate. Outside the courtroom door, there were four armed bailiffs, two unarmed, on guard. Inside the courtroom, there were two armed bailiffs and two unarmed attendants. At 2:30 PM, Presiding Judge Shi Meiyu also took his seat, along with Judges Lu Jiarui and Yu Yue, and Court Clerk Zhu Mingqiu, who also took their seats. Prosecutor Li Shudong also attended the court to perform his duties. Soon after, the traitor Miao was brought into the court for questioning. That day, Miao Bin was wearing a drab-colored striped gown, dark blue gabardine trousers, and black leather shoes, and his head was shaved and without a hat. Presiding Judge Shi interrogated him until 4:40 PM, after which Miao was ordered to sit on a chair and rest. Then, Zhou Wei, a member of the pseudo-Legislative Yuan, was called as a witness. Because of his old age, the traitor Zhou was granted a seat for questioning. Following this, Prosecutor Li delivered his opinion. Then, the three defense lawyers, Xie Shuqiang, Zhang Zhu, and Li Fusheng, made their respective defenses. At 5:20 PM, the arguments were concluded. Miao requested that Court Clerk Zhu read aloud his confession. After Miao corrected some errors, he signed the record. The court rejected Miao's and his defense lawyers' request to have the Military Statistics Bureau investigate the evidence. At 6:30 PM, Presiding Judge Shi announced the end of the arguments and ordered that the sentence be pronounced at 2 PM on the afternoon of April 8th. The traitor Miao was returned to custody, and the court was adjourned. That day, reporters and photographers from various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai came to Suzhou to cover the event. A large crowd gathered in front of the High Court and the Detention Center, vying to see the true face of the traitor Miao. While the trial was in session, Miao's wife, Xiang Xiujin, also stood outside the courtroom to listen. The newspaper photographers were particularly active. When Miao was brought out of the Detention Center, photographers followed him along the way. During the trial, they were also extremely busy, with the sound of cameras clicking incessantly.</p>
<p>Miao's Confession</p>
<p>According to Miao's confession, he was 44 years old and from Wuxi. When asked about his occupation in court, he replied, "I have always been engaged in politics." He joined the Kuomintang in the 11th year of the Republic [1922] and was never expelled from the party. The presiding judge informed the defendant that he had been prosecuted by the prosecutor under Articles 2, Section 1, and 12 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, and asked if he had anything to say. Miao then launched into a grand speech, as if delivering an address. He stated that he was released from the Military Statistics Bureau (Juntongju) and had written a voluminous book entitled "My Work Against Japan" and a defense brief, and that he very much wanted to take this opportunity to publicize the secrets of his ten years of counter-espionage against Japan.</p>
<p>He returned to China from the United States in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], intending to engage in industry.</p>
<p>But witnessing the "Japanese bandits advancing," he sought ways to strengthen the country. Therefore, in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], he wrote "On Military Virtue," published by the Kaiming Bookstore, advocating morality. Later, in Beiping, he met Commander-in-Chief He [Yingqin], and deeply understood that "full-scale resistance was inevitable." Because he knew that there were uprisings within Japan, he wanted to instigate revolution within Japan. In the 25th year of the Republic [1936], he went to Japan, arriving in Tokyo on the eve of the February 26th Incident. The leaders of the incident were also familiar with him. After returning to China, he reported in detail to Commander-in-Chief He, seeking ways to "use the enemy to control the enemy." General Yang Xuancheng, director of the Second Department of the Military Affairs Commission, had accompanied him to Japan.</p>
<p>He claimed to advocate "protecting the group with wisdom" rather than "protecting oneself with wisdom." He deeply admired the leader's [Chiang Kai-shek] advocacy of unified resistance, "regardless of north or south, regardless of men, women, old or young." Therefore, he engaged in resistance against Japan in the capacity of "one of the 400 million people." His organization, the "New People's Society," was also engaged in counter-espionage. The New People's Society changed "On Military Virtue" to "New People's Spirit," and "On Military Virtue" had already been publicly sold before the war. At that time, Miao was talking incessantly, oblivious to those around him, and was stopped by the presiding judge, who changed the proceedings to a question-and-answer format.</p>
<p>His reason for not going to the interior to engage in resistance work was "to continue counter-espionage work." However, his "work" had not been reported to the central government before August of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943].</p>
<p>In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], Miao, introduced by Xu Xiuzhi, went to Beiping to meet Japanese special agent Yoshino Hiromi and Yoshimura Torao. In January of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], he joined the New People's Society and became its vice-president. The president was Wang Kemin. The New People's Society and the "Great People's Society" and the "Concordia Association" of the puppet Manchukuo had roughly the same purpose, advocating cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and economic promotion. The presiding judge then asked, "Was it to overthrow the Chongqing government?" Miao initially claimed that it was a people's organization, but after being pressed, he replied, "Of course it was." He looked extremely embarrassed.</p>
<p>Miao also joined the so-called "East Asia League." He said that this organization was actually led by Ishiwara Kanji, a Japanese soldier who opposed the July 7th Incident, and that Ishiwara was extremely opposed to Tojo.</p>
<p>Japanese special agents Hideki Tojo, Kai Kaku, and Nemoto Hiroshi, who were Wang Kemin's backers, invited him to participate. "I seized the opportunity," which was in May of the 28th year of the Republic [1939].</p>
<p>Miao claimed to have gone to Japan several times, meeting Japanese military and political figures such as Konoe, Koiso, Itagaki, Araki, and Yamamoto, among others. Although he was a student who studied in the United States, he was proficient in Japanese and did not need an interpreter. In June of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], he met Wang Jingwei and Zhou Fohai at the home of a Japanese man named Koga in Tokyo through Japanese man Imai. It was extremely confidential and they discussed organizing the puppet government. After returning to China, he met Ishiwara Kanji and Prince Higashikuni in Beiping.</p>
<p>In October of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], he left Beiping to see Wang in Nanjing. In the 30th year of the Republic [1941], he served as the vice president of the puppet Legislative Yuan. During this time, he had close contact with Li Changjiang and helped Li to contact Wang to surrender, because Li was originally Miao's subordinate, but Li Mingyang can prove that this was a scheme. In the 31st year of the Republic [1942], Wang secretly dismissed him for some reason, but on the surface, he was reassigned to another position.</p>
<p>After Wang's death in January of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], Miao claimed that he advocated taking the opportunity to abolish the puppet government and had discussed it with Zhou Fohai and Matsui Iwane. In March of the 24th year of the Republic [1935], "under secret orders from the central government, I discussed with Colonel Yamagata, the secret representative of Koiso, to form a 'Residency' to replace the He [Yingqin] government." At that time, Koiso and Higashikuni were both in favor of peace, but it was abandoned due to opposition from the Japanese field army.</p>
<p>Miao claimed that starting in August of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he joined the Military Statistics Bureau through Station Chief Gu and a female comrade, and had received awards and commendations from Dai Li for his secret reports. At this time, the presiding judge produced a telegram from the Military Statistics Bureau, which, while acknowledging that Miao had made "some contributions," believed that his actions were launched when the Japanese army was already in full retreat, and could not be considered opportunistic. Therefore, they requested that he be prosecuted in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, the court rejected Miao's request to investigate the evidence. It also read aloud the leader's [Chiang Kai-shek] handwritten instructions, which also advocated that Miao be dealt with according to the law. Subsequently, the prosecutor rose to present his case, pointing out that there was no evidence to support any of Miao's defenses. The lawyers Xie Shuqiang, Zhang Zhu, and Ji Fusheng made their defenses one after another, stating that at the very least, consideration should be given to the "Regulations for Traitors' Self-Confession," and expressed regret that Li Mingyang was not investigated. Miao Bin also said, "The contradictions are too sharp in the records, I request an investigation of the evidence, this is too unfair."</p>

<h3>A Plea for Children!</h3>
<p>Today is the first Children's Day after the victory of the War of Resistance. Since we have had Children's Day, fifteen years have passed in a blink of an eye. For most of these fifteen years, we have lived through the flames of war, and tens of thousands of children have suffered the pain of being poisoned and ravaged. Now that the sky is bright again, and our country is returned to us, our dear children no longer have to leave their homes, no longer have to swallow their anger, and will no longer be forced to undergo enslaving education under the coercion of brutal enemies. They can all return to the embrace of their hometowns and bask in the warmth of the sun. On this auspicious festival, the children must be able to put away their bitter tears and join hands to sing and dance together to celebrate.</p>
<p>However, things turned out unexpectedly. Yesterday, on the eve of Children's Day, we received a letter from Mr. Wang Youchang, a middle school student who had just arrived in Shanghai from the interior. He expressed his disappointment and appealed for the transformation of the current schools, which truly moved us. Let us first excerpt the most important part of his letter below:</p>
<p>"When I first returned to Shanghai, how happy I was! I saw my hometown, the hometown where my footprints had been a few years ago. Last winter when I first arrived in Shanghai, I entered a school with a fairly good reputation. Then I entered this school that is not of the 20th century, and I began to be disappointed! Why? The reason is very simple. Because I have already seen progressive schools. Is its equipment perfect? No! In the great rear area during the War of Resistance, that was out of the question. And the nutrition was just as bad. But at that time, we fully utilized it, making every part of it become a part of our body, and even increasing the health of each of us. But now? Although I can eat food that seems to be very nutritious, it seems that my expectations are further away from me because of this. What I expect is just health. What I am learning is to prepare to compete in the world of the 20th century. But when I arrived in Shanghai, I was disappointed! I can't see the playing fields! I can't see the tents for camping! I can't see volleyball or basketball! Instead, there are pale and thin faces, with an extra pair of glasses on the bridge of the nose. I am confused! I am confused whether the people appearing in front of me are a group of young people! I wonder if I have entered a nursing home! I can't see the spirit of sports, I can't see the spirit of 'work when you work, play when you play,' but instead there is skipping classes, gambling, and dating! Is this their fault? No! This is not their fault, this is the fault of our old predecessors in education! They have deprived the students of every bit of time. But often there are people who praise them, sing their praises, and agree with their whips that exploit students. But this is not entirely their fault either, because they blindly follow some 19th-century ancients who support them. Now we have eight hours of class every day, sometimes even nine hours, which almost drains every drop of our brains. Do we have any extra time for extracurricular activities? Therefore, we have developed a lack of unity and cooperation. I think the reason why foreigners call us a heap of loose sand is because of this. Now I want to talk about what I have experienced. Because the students do not have enough mental and physical strength, they cannot understand what the teacher is saying. Because they cannot understand and because of the tight schedule, the preparation after class is very inadequate, so they fall further behind. Over time, due to both physical and mental factors, they simply stop studying. But what about his extra energy? He uses it for improper entertainment! It leads to the degeneration of young people and blurs the meaning of their lives. As a result, this 19th-century old machine produces two typical types of young people: One, the stooped and hunched, wearing deep glasses, the so-called excellent elements in the style of old scholars from the late Qing Dynasty (but only in the view of some people). They only know how to recite and write from memory, and they receive rewards and praise from some people. But they are just relics of the past and cannot be fighters of the 20th century. They can only be eliminated. Two, the degenerated youth. Sometimes they even utter words like democracy, but their democracy has neither theory nor practice!"</p>
<p>Although Mr. Wang is only a student at a certain middle school, and his letter is written in haste, we can hardly bear to read it after reading this paragraph. It is as if a group of sallow and thin "old mature youths" are making strange faces with their stooped and hunched backs in front of us, and at the same time, it is as if another group of gorgeously dressed young men in suits are chasing after objects, competing with each other in wealth. Indeed, it would be truly terrible if the future masters of China were entirely created from these models! Every Children's Day, I hear about competitions, meetings, and awards. The excitement is exciting, but may I ask how many parents and teachers spend how much energy and time on weekdays to think about children? Speaking of physique, the child mortality rate is as high as 260 to 270 per thousand. Due to the lack of protein, vitamin C, and iron in food, anemia in children has become a general phenomenon. Speaking of knowledge, out-of-school children still account for more than half of the school-age children. Speaking of morality, the poor families who wander and scavenge cannot be talked about, but even in so-called wealthy families, drinking, gambling, listening to books, and watching plays have long become common practices. How can we expect them to cultivate honest and strong young people in these environments of extravagance, luxury, snobbery, and acrimony? When we think about it, if our nation only cares about giving birth to sons and raising daughters, but does not know how to raise them, let alone teach them, and lets them go, we are really sorry to the children and sorry to our ancestors!</p>
<p>The world has now entered the era of atomic energy. Even if mankind is aware and the world is at peace, a person must have a healthy body to enjoy peace and happiness, and a country must have a healthy nation to enjoy peace and happiness. Moreover, peace still depends on the efforts of mankind, and peace must still be maintained by force. We want to study science. To enrich national defense, which one does not need to start with a strong physique? Mr. Wang said that every time he sees the strong foreigners in newsreels or sports films, he is afraid, afraid of the fate of China entrusted to these sick young men! What a shocking appeal!</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of just adding some embellishments to children's happiness on Children's Day, we should all seriously do a few things that are beneficial to children and promote the health of the nation. Without delving into lofty theories, let us put forward the following points to plead for children:</p>
<p>First, we demand that there be absolutely no street children in the city, especially that child beggars not be tolerated. How to organize vocational training centers and the like in the shortest possible time to accommodate and educate all street children, so that they can acquire a skill that is enough to support themselves, is a business that local self-government should have, and it is also the responsibility of the government and all citizens.</p>
<p>Second, we demand that there be no out-of-school children in the city. Popularizing education and eliminating illiteracy are old tunes that have been heard for decades, but unfortunately they have not really been achieved to this day. Assuming that one-tenth of Shanghai's 3.4 million people are school-age children, how to accommodate 340,000 elementary school students into school so that they can really attend classes for free is really a major event for the municipal government. We do not necessarily have to demand that every elementary school student attend six hours of classes a day. If they can attend school for half a day and spend half a day on self-study or sports, it would really be more beneficial.</p>
<p>Third, we demand that the city open up more parks, open spaces, or sports fields, swimming pools, and the like as much as possible, so that children have the opportunity to practice fitness and engage in proper entertainment.</p>
<p>Fourth, we demand that the curricula of primary and secondary schools should be revised as soon as possible, and that we should no longer blindly believe in experts in various subjects, who only care about injecting more knowledge and making the course time excessively heavy, so that students cannot bear the burden and harm their bodies. We believe that it is better to "eat less and savor more" than to "be greedy and not be able to chew." Primary and secondary schools should make music and physical education compulsory subjects for cultivating students' character and physique. On weekends and holidays, we should especially promote hiking and exercise the body and mind. If the physical strength of primary and secondary school students is weak and sickly, even if they have great knowledge, they will still be useless after they grow up!</p>
<p>Fifth, we ask the government and society to establish more physics and chemistry laboratories, children's libraries, and produce and import a large number of educational films, while strictly prohibiting all obscene and criminal books and films, etc., so that children can grow up in a purified society. They have scientific minds and strong bodies, and can stand in the future world trend.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, the reporter rushed to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison to wait. At 8:35 AM, five large canvas-covered Qingpu trucks successively drove in.

After these trucks drove into the gate one by one, they drove into the second gate in sequence, and the prosecutors interrogated them one by one to determine their age and place of origin before detaining them.

Du Baoqi, the chief prosecutor of the High Procuratorate, and Huang Liang, the chief prosecutor of the District Procuratorate, both came to inspect in person. Prison Director Jiang Gongliang was also extraordinarily busy. These seventy-one prisoners are now detained in the Zhongzi Prison.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the first batch of the above seventy-one people was handed over to the court. On the same day, six people were escorted to the Military Law Execution and Supervision Department. These six people are Wen Zongyao (puppet president of the Control Yuan), Sheng Youlan, Xu (i.e., Xu Tieshan), as well as Gong Jinqin, Tang Mang, and Luo Hongyi.</p>
<p>Can Be Completed in Half a Month</p>

<p>Chief Prosecutor's Remarks</p>
<p>Yesterday, Du Baoqi, the chief prosecutor of the High Procuratorate, told reporters that he would definitely punish these traitors in accordance with national law and would never be lenient. Otherwise, if there is another war against foreign countries, it is truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>Then let us all wait and see!</p>
<h3>China Merchants' New Ships Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>Sending Personnel to Inspect and Prepare for Reception</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] China Merchants' Bureau's purchase of new American ships continues to arrive in Shanghai. It is heard that a (N3) type new ship is berthed at the Wusong Estuary. In order to prepare for the reception and to ensure that the crew understands the equipment and structure of the new ship, Huang Muzong, the director of the Shipping Department, will lead six members of the engine department's crew, including Qu Gongxin and Chen Songxiang, to Wusong Estuary by small boat at 6:00 AM this morning to inspect the new ship. The Haiyi, which arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd, is berthed next to the Qimei. The Haiyi, named the Huang Xing, is scheduled to be received at 2:00 PM today. Zhu Bingwen has been appointed as the captain, and Zhou Xiaoda as the second mate. Zhu Bingwen was originally assigned as the captain of the Qimei, but because the American captain of that ship had a contractual relationship, it was not handed over, so he was reassigned as the captain of the Huang Xing.</p>
<h3>Clearing the Warehouses Along the Riverfront; Three Measures Decided</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to accelerate the clearing of warehouses along the riverfront in this city, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has reportedly decided on the following measures for implementation: (1) All entrusted agencies holding bills of lading for the China Merchants' Bureau's North Stockade, Middle Stockade, and Jin Liyuan Wharf must pick up their goods before the 5th of this month, otherwise they will be auctioned by the customs.

<h3>Fake Secretary-General of the 米統會 (Rice Control Commission) Zhou Chunyu Summoned Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Claims He Was Framed Due to Personal Grudges</h3>
<h3>Defendant's Lawyer Detained in Chongqing Awaiting Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The following is a special record of the traitor cases heard by the High Court yesterday:</p>
<p>Zhou Chunyu</p>
<p>43 years old, from Ningbo. Formerly served as Secretary-General of the puppet Rice Grain Compilation Committee. In November of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), while in office, he was accused of corruption and dereliction of duty, arrested by the enemy constabulary, and transferred to the puppet court, where he was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, which he served. After the victory, the case was investigated by the current High Procuratorate Office on March 13th, which deemed it to be a violation of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, and filed a public prosecution. During the court session yesterday morning, the defendant readily admitted to having held a puppet position. He stated that he had been hired for the position by Yuan Ludeng, the Director of the puppet Rice Control Commission, due to their long-standing family friendship and common hometown. However, he claimed that even though he held a puppet position, he never forgot his country. He claimed that he was being framed due to personal grudges and requested the court to investigate the matter clearly. Because his defense lawyer, Chen Tingrui, was still in Chongqing, the defendant requested a postponement of the hearing. The court reviewed the statement and ordered that the case be held for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Zhang Suxing</p>
<p>The third son of Zhang Taozhi, a former official of the puppet Supreme Court, 30 years old, from Hangzhou. He was formerly employed as the Director of the Nanshi Tobacco Inspection Office of the puppet Shanghai Anti-Smoking Bureau, and as a member of the Legal Affairs Committee of the puppet Shanghai East First District Public Office. He also associated with the traitor Sheng Youzhi (i.e., Sheng Lao San). In Sheng's drug trafficking organization, "Hongji Weitang," he assisted with stamping and subcontracting work. After the victory, he was arrested by the police and transferred to the High Procuratorate Office, which filed a public prosecution. Yesterday morning, the defendant strongly denied all the charges against him. The court, having Sheng's confession as evidence, reviewed the statement and ordered that the case be rescheduled for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Two Puppet Officials Sentenced Separately</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, two more traitor cases were pronounced. They are: (1) Song Guiren and Wang Yaoting, employees of the puppet Shanghai Finance Bureau Nanshi Tax Collection Office, were found to have conspired with the enemy to resist our country. They were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, with deprivation of public rights for two years. All their property was confiscated, except for what was deemed necessary for the living expenses of their families. (2) Huang Zhongliang, the Director of the puppet Minhang Rice Grain Office, was found to have conspired with the enemy to supply grain and rice. He was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, with deprivation of public rights for five years. All his property was confiscated, except for what was deemed necessary for the living expenses of his family.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminals in China to be Publicly Tried Within the Week</h3>
<h3>Military Tribunal Ready</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since its establishment in mid-last month, the Military Tribunal of the First Pacification Zone Command of the Military Affairs Commission has been arresting Japanese war criminals who committed atrocities in China based on people's accusations. A total of sixty-four people have been arrested by the military authorities of this city. The prosecutor has completed the preliminary investigation, and they are currently being held at the Tilanqiao Detention Center. Most of these war criminals are former officers of the Japanese Kempeitai (military police). Two of them will be interrogated again within the next few days, after which they may be publicly tried this week. However, due to the limited space in the courtroom, only a limited number of requests from the public to attend the hearing will be granted. Our reporter, accompanied by Deputy Adjutant He Huaqiang, visited the fully arranged military tribunal yesterday. The setting is simple yet solemn. A large national flag hangs in the center, with five seats for judges beneath it. To the left are seats for the prosecutor and the interpreter, and to the right are seats for the clerk. A semi-circular wooden railing surrounds the area. The first row outside the railing is for news reporters, and behind them are five rows of seats for the audience, accommodating approximately fifty people. Furthermore, the U.S. military in this city has requested to send personnel to attend the hearing as observers, which has been approved. However, the request from the officers of the Japanese prisoner-of-war concentration camp to attend the hearing is still under consideration.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Merchant Robbed</h3>
<h3>Loss of Diamond and Jade Ornaments Worth Five Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At 8:30 PM last night, five robbers suddenly broke into the home of Feng Zhikang, a Shaoxing native who owns a jewelry business at No. 2 Rongxiang Lane, Songxue Street, Fangbang Road. They confined the residents of the house in one room and robbed two diamond rings, two gold rings, and various jade and emerald ornaments, worth approximately five million yuan, before escaping.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Repatriation of Japanese Nationals and Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and civilians has increased significantly due to the assistance of more than fifty Liberty ships and landing crafts provided by the U.S. military. Yesterday, Xie Haoling, the Commander of the Shanghai Port, told our reporter that from November of last year to the end of March of this year, a total of 357,183 Japanese prisoners of war and civilians have been repatriated.</p>
<h3>Rickshaws Almost Disappeared Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Opposition to Sharp Increase in Rental Fees Prompts Full Strike</h3>
<h3>Over Ten Thousand Silk Weaving Workers March and Petition in the Rain</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The citywide labor unrest, which had subsided for a while, re-emerged yesterday with the full strike launched by rickshaw pullers and the march and petition of over ten thousand male and female silk weaving workers. The rickshaw pullers' strike was triggered by the sudden increase in rental fees. It is reported that the rental fee was originally 600 yuan per day, but it has risen to over 2,000 yuan in less than a few days. As a result, over three thousand rickshaw pullers launched a strike yesterday morning, spreading the word to other rickshaw pullers on various roads. By evening, the strike had become citywide.</p>
<p>It is reported that there are currently over one hundred and twenty rickshaw companies in the city, with over thirty-seven thousand rickshaws and over fifty thousand rickshaw pullers. Once a full strike occurs, it will have a significant impact on the city's transportation. It is reported that the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association is currently negotiating a resolution. The Social Affairs Bureau is also paying close attention to this matter.</p>
<p>Also, at 8:00 AM yesterday, over ten thousand male and female workers from the silk weaving industry unions of Districts 1, 2, 3, and 4 gathered at the Bund Park and then marched in formation past the City Hall and along Hankou Road to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for the implementation of the eight measures decided upon during the mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau on March 29th. Halfway through the march, a heavy rain suddenly fell. The ten thousand male and female workers looked miserable. The procession blocked traffic for half an hour.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the North Station: The Newly Opened Restaurant's Exterior</h3>
<h3>Full of Tropical Flair</h3>
<h3>UNRRA Ships Hundreds of Freight Cars</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Xingwu</p>
<p>Whether in peacetime or wartime, railway transportation always occupies an important position. Not only can it not be interrupted for a moment, but it also needs to be constantly improved to meet the needs. China after the victory, of course, cannot ignore the railway transportation. You only need to take a tour of the North Station to know the authorities' emphasis on the railway.</p>
<p>Although the transportation capacity of the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) lines is extremely lacking, it is still impossible to avoid the crowding of passengers, but the "black hats", "scalpers", extortion... of the enemy puppet period have long been swept away.</p>
<p>The short and capable Chief of the North Station—one of the actual persons in charge of the North Station, I met him yesterday. He took time out of his busy schedule to accompany me to visit the North Station restaurant, which will open on the 4th. The red roof, the brightly colored walls, and especially the palm trees and banana trees in front of the door, are full of tropical flair. This was originally the box office, and it took more than ten million yuan and three months of renovation to make it a success. There are special express meals for 3,000 yuan each, curry chicken rice for 1,000 yuan each, coffee for 600 yuan a cup, beer for 900 yuan a bottle, sandwiches, toast, milk, cocoa, mixed rice, fried rice, and all kinds of Chinese and Western pastries. The waitresses have all received rigorous training, and the bad habit of petty charges has been abolished. The problem of passenger corruption has been solved from now on.</p>
<p>Passengers dragging heavy luggage is very inconvenient, so the North Station has set up a luggage storage area. You can safely hand over your luggage to them. You can slowly send someone to pick it up. It only costs 100 yuan for every 24 hours.</p>
<p>The station chief said: "The gasoline train will soon be extended to the route from Shanghai to Nanjing. A special express train requires seven and a half hours for the Jinghu trip. A gasoline train only takes five and a half hours to take you from Shanghai to Nanjing. This plan will probably be implemented within half a month. As for the name, fare, and stopping stations of the 'Taihu' train, they are still under discussion." Because of the increase in train services, the running time of all trains on the two lines will be changed. The night train to Nanjing may depart at 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chief Tong also told reporters the latest news. He said that he just heard from Section Chief Ouyang Zhi, which is a real piece of good news: UNRRA has delivered 382 freight cars, including flat cars, high-side cars, and covered cars. These freight cars have been sent to the Qiqi Weir Factory for repairs and can be used after repair. In the future, the freight of the two lines will undoubtedly increase greatly. In addition, UNRRA has also provided fourteen wood-burning locomotives, which have arrived in Shanghai and will be allocated and assigned by the Ministry of Communications. The Jinghu and Huhang lines are close to the water tower and will definitely be able to allocate a considerable number. Therefore, Station Chief Tong is absolutely optimistic about the passenger and freight transport of the two lines in the future.</p>
<p>There are many passengers during the spring break, so since yesterday, an additional special express train has been added to the Huhang line, running up and down once a day, departing from Hangzhou at 10:45 AM and departing from Shanghai at 2:55 PM. This is of course good news for passengers, especially for those who are going on spring outings.</p>

<h3>One of the "Five Tiger Generals"</h3>
<h3>Bandit Chief Pretends to Be a Young Master</h3>
<h3>Pretending to be Agency Personnel, Committing Numerous Crimes</h3>
<h3>Many Arrested, Various Weapons Confiscated</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Lu Bihu, the Director of the North Station Police Sub-bureau, received information on the 21st of last month that a well-known bandit leader, Shen Zhixiong, a local resident, 23 years old, was hiding at No. 39 Fuyi Lane, Shengping Street, Muir Road. It was found that the suspect had been engaged in pickpocketing at the North Railway Station since he was 14 years old and was known as one of the "Five Tiger Generals" among the pickpocketing community. He usually wore suits and leather shoes, entering and leaving song and dance halls, looking like a profligate young master. Recently, Shen has become even more extreme, impersonating personnel of the Garrison Headquarters, forming gangs and robbing, committing many crimes. Finally, Li Jiachu, the Chief of the Judicial Section of the Sub-bureau, led officers Liu Zichang, Inspector Deng Shu, plainclothes police chiefs Kang Zengxiang, Zhao Zenggui, Lu Yixin, policemen Zhang Shide, Zhang Yuzhen, Li Xianwen, Liu Changhua, and others to the above-mentioned location, where they arrested him at the entrance of his residence. They also found military uniforms, armed belts, a Japanese military sword, a U.S. latest-style Thompson submachine gun, an old-style light machine gun, a Mauser pistol, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition of various sizes in his home. Subsequently, they successively arrested accomplices Lu Kongbiao, Lu's wife Lu Yazhen (who was responsible for transporting guns in a hand tube), Shen's wife Shen Wangshi, Xu Chuncheng, Sun Chaxiang, and Shen Xiagen, a porter at the Central Hotel (who was responsible for storing guns), in Shanghai. They also went to a hotel in Suzhou and arrested Lu Wei and Liu Fengxiang, and recovered some of the stolen goods. According to their confessions: at 6:00 or 7:00 PM on October 27th of last year, Shen and his gang went to Hongxing Iron Factory at No. 835 Suzhou Road, impersonating personnel of the Third War Zone Command investigating enemy property to arrest traitors. As a result, they robbed 470,000 legal tender. At 7:00 PM on November 27th, they went to the home of a certain Yu at No. 4 Songshan Road, pretending to deliver ducks to open the gate. They fired a shot as a warning and robbed twelve gold bars, two small bars, and a large number of gold, diamond, and emerald ornaments, as well as suits and bicycles, estimated to be worth 11.77 million legal tender. At 5:00 PM on January 1st, they went to the home of a certain Cai at No. 1, Lane 181, Xiaoshadu Road, and robbed three diamond rings, each about 60 points, along with clothes, worth 210,000 legal tender. At 7:00 PM on the 12th of the same month, they went to the home of a certain Zhou at No. 16, Lane 356, Route Ghisi, and robbed whiskey, diamond rings, gold watches, clothes, emerald rings, and 200 U.S. dollars, worth 6.33 million legal tender. At a certain number in Henry Lane, Shili Road, they robbed gold watch chains and a large number of counterfeit currency, etc., but the date has been forgotten. They also went to rob at Guba Road, Northwest Shanxi Road, and Fook Hing Road, etc., but were unsuccessful. It was also confessed that they often divided the spoils in the long rooms No. 424 and 438 on the fourth floor of the Central Hotel on Fifth Horse Road. According to Chief Li, when they committed robberies, they wore military uniforms and were well-organized, with ranks such as adjutants and grooms. Shen's residence was luxuriously decorated and well-arranged, and equipped with wireless telephones. All rooms upstairs and downstairs could communicate, like a big family. The tenants living in the same house sometimes glimpsed them going out with guns and handcuffs, fully equipped as soldiers, so they did not suspect anything else.</p>
<h3>Uniform Military Attire to be Implemented on May 1st</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Uniform military attire for the entire country will be implemented on May 1st. According to Zhao Zhigui, the Commander of the First Supply Zone of the General Logistics Command, the recent strikes by workers in some commercial military uniform factories in the city may cause slight delays. Therefore, he has telegraphed military uniform factories in various locations to rush production nearby, so that everything can be completed within the timeframe stipulated by the central government.</p>

The Huangpu Sub-bureau has ordered the person in charge of the shop to be brought to justice and punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>The Enemy and Puppets Forcibly Occupied Property Should Be Returned Immediately; The Time Limit for Land Registration Is Deemed Too Short; City Councilors Raised Questions at the Sixth General Meeting</h3>
<p>(Report from this Newspaper) The City Council's Review Committee held its first group review meeting yesterday morning, and the sixth general meeting was held at 3:20 PM, with 27 councilors present, and 10 proposals received.</p>
<p>Report from the Land Administration Bureau</p>
<p>After Chairman Xu Jiqing's speech, Chen Shiquan, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, reported on the work done in the past six months. He stated briefly: This city is the economic hub of the country. Due to the extraterritoriality of the concessions in the past, the situation of foreign business real estate companies and foreign property ownership was complicated. After eight years of enemy and puppet occupation, land administration became even more chaotic. Therefore, the Land Administration Bureau paid special attention to clearing land rights and reorganizing land registration. The core work can be divided into six items: (1) Compiling atlases of various districts and redrawing the boundaries of Huangpu District (i.e., the former Public Concession and French Concession) according to natural topography, totaling 40,000 perpetual lease deeds. (2) The city governs 31 districts, with a total area of 1,334.049 municipal acres. The complete survey work is expected to be completed within this year. (3) During the enemy and puppet period, land rights were confused and boundaries were unclear due to coercion and seizure. Therefore, the Land Administration Bureau actively handled land ownership and transfer registration, land reclamation, perpetual lease land registration, and the clearing of land rights registration by enemy and puppet organizations. (4) Huangpu and other six districts conducted group surveys, collected data, and divided land price sections. Charts were drawn, and a standard land price evaluation committee was organized, which decided to temporarily use the valuation of the 30th year of the Republic of China as the standard, increasing it by a multiple (currently 400 times) to match land registration. (5) The land forcibly requisitioned and occupied by enemy and puppet real estate companies, airfields, farms, etc., reached more than 161,970 acres. These lands can be returned upon application by the owners, or the requisition price can be compensated. (6) According to preliminary statistics and surveys by the Land Administration Bureau, the publicly owned land has a total of 1.186 hills and 5.776 acres, which is three and a half times more than before. However, there must still be omissions, so it has been decided to continue the investigation, especially the properties of the former French Concession's Board of Directors, many of which were concealed by the French Consulate. The municipal government is currently negotiating to recover them and has requested instructions from the central government to recover them through diplomatic channels. In addition to the above six points, Director Chen also reported on the completion of the clearing of perpetual lease title deeds, the complicated property rights issues during the enemy and puppet period, and the most difficult issues such as land registration for owners not in Shanghai.</p>
<p>How to Overcome Difficulties in Foreign Property Ownership</p>
<p>After Director Chen finished his report, the councilors raised questions one after another. Xu Shihao first raised four points: 1. The time limit for land registration is too short. Instead of extending it repeatedly, it is better to make accurate estimates in advance and extend the registration period. 2. The receipt for registration should preferably indicate the title deed number and acreage to show solemnity and to enable citizens to use it for economic purposes. 3. Land right documents should be returned quickly or replaced with photos or copies during registration. 4. The registration public announcement period in the Land Law is too long. The local bureau has requested the central government to approve a shorter period, which is convenient for citizens, but it is not known whether it has been approved by the legislative body. Ye Fenghu also inquired about the future methods of handling foreign property ownership, enemy and puppet real estate, and how to overcome the various difficulties in the public land investigation. Cao Jun asked two points: (1) The airfields and farms built by the enemy occupying citizens' land have now been taken over by the Aviation Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. What should be done? The Land Administration Bureau should immediately investigate the owners and return the land separately or formulate appropriate disposal measures. (2) Is there a plan to complete the land survey in the short term?</p>
<p>The Standard for Land Valuation Is Inevitably Uneven</p>
<p>Pan Xulun suggested that land registration should preferably be completed by district and within a time limit, and that the registration fee previously collected beyond that stipulated in the Land Law should preferably be refunded. The valuation used to be based on the 30th year of the Republic of China, increased to 200 times, and recently adjusted to 400 times, while the rent is based on the 26th year of the Republic of China, only 60 times or 40 times, which is inevitably uneven. Zhou Xuexiang, Zhao Banfu, Ji Hao, Xu Yongzuo, Lu Huimin and others inquired about the handling of housing disputes by the Housing Rental Management Committee and the return of more than 800 houses occupied by the enemy and puppets. Shui Xiangyun, Chuan Tongxian, Li Bojia, Fan Caiji, Tao Guangchuan and others all inquired about land policies, land registration procedures, registration fees, land valuation, and the investigation of public land.</p>
<p>Answers to Each Point</p>
<p>Director Chen then answered each point one by one: (1) Regarding registration, it has already been extended for six months, and those who are late are being supplemented. Phased registration can achieve the effect of urging. (2) Measures have also been taken to improve the receipt to indicate the acreage. (3) Land right documents can be reviewed in half a month. (4) As for valuation, it will be handled carefully. (5) Foreign property ownership will await instructions from the central government. According to the new Sino-American regulations, foreigners can also have property rights, and the central government will have a complete method. (6) The land occupied by the enemy and puppets is now being discussed with the Aviation Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. As for airfields and farms, the requisition price will be compensated. (7) Due to various difficulties, the overcharged registration fee will not be refunded. (8) The housing shortage problem is that the Rental Committee is only an agency for mediating disputes and reducing housing litigation. Due to economic constraints, it cannot be expanded further. (9) Regarding the real estate of the former French Concession's Board of Directors, there are now Sino-French schools, French barracks, patrol hospitals, and the French Consulate, etc. It is hoped that the Council, as a public opinion organ, will urge the French Board to return them in a friendly manner. After Director Chen finished his reply, Speaker Xu announced that the deadline for receiving proposals, originally scheduled for Thursday, has now been extended to Saturday, and the meeting adjourned at 6:20 PM.</p>
<p>Group Review Committee Reviews Various Proposals</p>
<p>The Provisional Council held its first group review meeting yesterday morning, reviewing a total of 40 proposals.</p>
<p>The first group reviewed proposals related to civil affairs, autonomy, and security matters, reviewing eight proposals. Five cases were discussed together. The four cases proposed by Councilor Hou Junren and others, proposing that the government should quickly take over the enemy's shrines and convert them into loyalty shrines to enshrine the military and civilians who died in the war of resistance or sacrificed due to unyielding, so as to publicize loyalty, were passed and submitted to the general meeting for reconsideration. The second group reviewed proposals related to finance, economy, construction, etc., reviewing 27 proposals. Two cases were reserved, four cases were discussed together, and were eventually passed. The twenty-one cases proposed by Councilor Pan Xulun and others, proposing that the general meeting should suggest that the central government promptly promulgate the "Urban Housing Rental Acceptance Regulations" to regulate urban housing rentals and reduce disputes and difficulties, were passed and submitted to the general meeting for reconsideration. The third group reviewed proposals related to education and culture, reviewing five proposals. The four cases proposed by Councilor Zhou Feicheng and others, proposing that all organs and troops occupying school buildings should be ordered to move out quickly to maintain the city's education, were passed and submitted to the general meeting for reconsideration.</p>
<h3>Suppressing Prices and Stabilizing People's Livelihood; Ye Fenghu and Others Proposed Seven Principles</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Among the proposals yesterday were Ye Fenghu, Hou Junren, Shen Chunhui, Feng Youzhen, Lu Tan, Xu Yongzuo, and Zhu Su'e, proposing emergency measures to suppress the city's prices and stabilize people's livelihood. The specific methods include seven items: (1) Prioritize the allocation of transportation to speed up the purchase and transportation from abroad. (2) Relief and enemy and puppet industry food should be released in full and distributed to the city's residents according to a per capita rationing system.

<h3>Answering Readers</h3>
<p>Qing from Jinze, Zhang Guochang asks: (1) In the 15th year of the Republic of China, my friend Wang sold his house to the Li family with a mortgage, specifying a term of five years in the contract. Now he intends to redeem it, but the Li family refuses, saying that mortgage of farmland and houses with a term of more than ten years is not allowed for redemption. Is there actually a legal regulation within ten years? (2) Cao bought several acres of farmland from the Wu family in the 27th year of the Republic of China, with a contract specifying an absolute sale. Now, because the former owner Wu wants to redeem it at the original price, claiming that absolute sales during the war of resistance can also be redeemed after ten years, is it actually legal? (3) Before and during the war of resistance, mortgage sales of farmland and houses were priced at only a few hundred yuan. If one wants to redeem it now, according to the law, how many times the original price should be used for redemption?</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers: (1) According to Article 8 of the Regulations on the Management of Real Estate Mortgages, redemption is allowed within ten years from the date of establishment. (2) If the sales contract is legally established, of course it cannot be redeemed. (3) According to Article 11 of the revised Civil Procedure Law, the court may moderately increase the redemption amount.</p>
<p>Wang Shixun asks: I am twenty-two years old this year. When I was nineteen, I got engaged to Miss Yi. Although there was a so-called meeting at that time, and my parents also asked me, I always had no reason to object because I was younger. A lot of jewelry was brought over by my family at the time of the engagement. Now, because Miss Yi and I are not very harmonious, we have privately agreed to cancel the engagement, but Yi suddenly regrets saying that we did not agree. Therefore, I have several undecided matters, (1) Yi refuses to cancel the engagement, how can I legally cancel it? (2) Can the jewelry and other gifts given at the time of the engagement be recovered by the introducer?</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers: (1) The marriage contract should be made by the parties themselves. If you did not agree to the engagement at the beginning, it is not effective. (2) If the man is not at fault, he can request recovery.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Qian Dajun</p>
<p>Children are the cells of national reproduction and the future masters of the country. They are directly related to the continuation of national life and indirectly related to the rise and fall of the country's destiny. Former US President Hoover once said, "World progress revolves around the heels of children." Indeed, "The twentieth century is the century of children."</p>
<p>This city has a large population. According to recent survey results, there are more than 3.345 million people, of which children under the age of fourteen account for 10%. Therefore, the children's problem in this city is extremely important. How to strengthen children's education and maintain children's health is an urgent matter. The government should do its best, and all citizens and parents in our city should also deeply understand this and cooperate together for easier results.</p>
<p>Taking children's education as an example, school education and family education must be equally emphasized. If children have a good family environment, they will naturally become good children. Conversely, proximity to vermilion makes one red, proximity to ink makes one black. The bad habits of adults can easily have a profound impact on children. In this way, not only will family education not be able to cooperate with school education, but the bad family environment will reduce the effectiveness of school education. As for children's health, parents must pay attention to it. First, they must focus on nutrition. In terms of diet, they must consider the child's age and physique and provide appropriate supplies. Secondly, special attention must be paid to children's diseases. For example, trachoma, otitis media, and tonsils are common diseases in children, but most parents ignore them, which is wrong. In addition, clothing, food, housing, and transportation must also be reasonable. Things like irregular breastfeeding, clothes that are too tight or too thick, closing windows tightly to prevent air circulation, and fearing that children will catch a cold are all harmful to children's health. The infant mortality rate in our country is high among people, reaching 200 to 275 or more per year, which is unmatched by other countries. This is caused by neglecting children's health.</p>
<p>This city is at the beginning of recovery, and there are many things to be done. Due to limited funds, children's welfare undertakings have not been as ideal as possible. How to make practical efforts in the future depends on the consistent assistance of people from all walks of life and the automatic attention of children's parents. This year's Children's Day, the Health Bureau held a children's health competition, the purpose of which is to awaken society's attention to children's health, attach importance to children's status, and then seek the expansion of children's welfare undertakings. I sincerely hope that citizens of the whole city will pay attention to it, widely publicize it, and that children's health in our country will become more and more advanced and their physique will become stronger and stronger, which is the great fortune of the country.</p>
<h3>How are We Responsible to Children?</h3>
<p>— Yu Songjun</p>
<p>A celebrity once said: "The twentieth century is the century of children." That's right, in the past few decades, the idea of ​​"child-centered" has indeed been very popular in education, especially in the one or two decades after the end of the First World War. Unfortunately, within these short decades, two world wars broke out one after another. War is most harmful to people's lives. Many children sacrificed their lives in the artillery fire. Many children were displaced because their homes were destroyed. Many children do not receive care. And many children, although they still have the care of parents and teachers, cannot develop very well in terms of physical or psychological aspects due to the lack of various conditions.</p>
<p>During the war, children who had families to rely on and schools to attend could be said to be extremely lucky. However, according to the research of several experts in Shanghai and Chongqing, the nutrients supplied daily in the diet of children in wartime China, such as cooked energy, fats and oils, protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamins A, C, and D, are all insufficient; among them, the degree of protein deficiency is enough to make the protein content in plasma 22% below the minimum limit of normal plasma protein. Due to the simultaneous lack of protein, vitamin C, and iron, the general children show signs of anemia. The impact of this malnutrition can make children develop one year slower than usual. (According to Wang Chengfa's report). Just this point can show how wronged children are and how much loss the country has suffered!</p>
<p>Here we deeply feel the evil and horror of the aggressive ideology that caused the war. In the era of Wilhelm II and Hitler's rule in Germany, the children in the country were regarded as a capital for external development, and cultivating children meant cultivating the power of aggression. Japan is the same. In the past 100 years, Japan has paid great attention to children's education; but the motive for paying attention is only to create batches of tools to die for Japanese imperialism. The result of the development of aggressive ideology is not only that the children of the aggressor countries are poisoned, but also that the vitality of children all over the world is harmed.</p>
<p>Now the war is over. On the one hand, of course, we must seek relief as soon as possible so that children in hunger and cold can obtain food and clothing; so that children who are out of school can receive education. Moreover, further, we should use scientific knowledge, according to the natural requirements of children, to make children grow completely. On the other hand, for the future of children and for the future of mankind, we must actively promote our Chinese peace ideology that has been passed down for generations. Our peace ideology is reflected in the legacy of ancient sages and sages. The "Li Yun" chapter of the Book of Rites requires "the young to be cared for." We must care for children in this way so that the vitality of the nation will not be blocked. Mencius said: "Love my young and extend it to the young of others." We must have this spirit of universal love so that children can truly be happy and avoid future disasters.</p>
<p>Today is the first Children's Day after the victory. We feel heartbroken when we think of the lack of care for children in the past and the many destructive behaviors. From now on, we will seek permanent happiness for children. We want to make the saying "The 20th century is the century of children" not just an ideal or hope, but a definite and unswerving fact.</p>

<h3>The Meaning and Responsibility of the First Children's Day After Victory</h3>
<p>— Kong Xiangxi</p>
<p>This year today marks the first Children's Day after the victory against Japan, which can also be said to be a Children's Day celebrated uniformly across the country. Commemorating this festive day for children, which is closely related to the rise and fall of the nation, amidst the nationwide cheers of victory, brings immeasurable joy and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Recalling the origin of Children's Day, it was initiated by myself in the 20th year of the Republic of China as the president of the China Child Welfare Association, and submitted to the government for adoption and promulgation, reaching its fifteenth anniversary this year. At that time, foreign aggression was increasingly urgent, and the nation was facing a crisis. The Chinese nation was in a difficult and dangerous situation. People at that time deeply felt that to strengthen the country, we must first strengthen the people, and to strengthen the people, we must start with children. The slogan at that time was: To revive the nation, we must first nurture children. Since the July 7th Incident, our entire nation has resisted the Japanese invaders with blood and flesh, and fought for survival. Therefore, for the past eight years, every Children's Day has been spent in painful and arduous days, and could not be celebrated uniformly across the country. Looking at the children on that day and gazing at the future of the nation, one could not help but feel comforted and excited. However, the mood was never as joyful and happy as it is today after victory.</p>
<p>Eight years of hardship have won the final victory. Domestic unity has laid the foundation for national reconstruction. The future of the new China is full of light and hope. Today, as we commemorate this great Children's Day, after finally washing away a century of shame, with the recovery of our territory and the restoration of freedom, it has a special meaning and value. As the president of the China Child Welfare Association, I would like to express my thoughts to my compatriots:</p>
<p>(1) Commemorating Children's Day Requires Completing the Great Task of National Reconstruction</p>
<p>With the victory against Japan, national reconstruction has begun. Although the cause of resisting Japan was extremely difficult, the task of national reconstruction is even more arduous. The completion of this complex and great undertaking requires not only our generation to strive for it, but also the next generation of citizens to continue their efforts. Children are the new blood of the nation and the inheritors of culture. Whether they will be able to shoulder the great responsibility of carrying on the past and opening up the future depends on the education and nurturing they receive today. In our imagination, there is a vision of a strong, prosperous, and happy new China. But we must not neglect the future masters who will build and support this new China. If we want to maintain the victory won with countless heads and blood, and ensure the long-term preservation of the freedom we have gained, we must make the next generation and future generations of citizens healthy, strong, and promising. On this Children's Day, we must raise social awareness, value children, protect children, educate children, and nurture children, so that they can achieve healthy growth, become national leaders, and complete the great task of national reconstruction.</p>
<p>(2) Commemorating Children's Day Requires Permanently Maintaining World Peace</p>
<p>In today's world, where the flames of war have just subsided and devastation is everywhere, what all humanity seeks is lasting world peace. The painful experience of the past eight years tells us that only peace brings hope and happiness. Otherwise, there will only be pain and destruction. How can lasting peace be achieved? And how can it be guaranteed after it is achieved? We believe that the most thorough and fundamental way is to start with nurturing children. Use the power of education to eliminate their aggressive thoughts, and use the power of healthcare to enhance their self-defense capabilities, so that the entire nation can flourish. On the one hand, eradicate their aggressive, murderous, retaliatory, and destructive thoughts. On the other hand, cultivate their virtues of benevolence, peace, suppressing the strong, helping the weak, mutual assistance, and construction, so that all nations in the world can develop universally, coexist and prosper, and peace will be easily realized. It is hoped that from now on, all countries will educate children in this spirit, encourage each other, and eliminate the psychology of mutual slaughter and cyclical retaliation. The ideal world of universal harmony and the world as one family can be expected to be realized. On this Children's Day, it is hoped that all parents, teachers, and all those responsible for education and care should encourage themselves and each other with this.</p>
<p>Since we know the great significance of commemorating Children's Day this year, we should redouble our efforts in children's welfare. However, the scope of children's welfare is very broad. From which aspects should we strive to do it? I would like to point out the two most important points based on the current needs and elaborate on them as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Emphasize Children in Reconstruction Work. The first urgent and important task after victory is reconstruction, so that people who have suffered eight years of hardship can recuperate and restore the nation's vitality. However, in the reconstruction work, the reconstruction of children should be even more important, because today's children were still infants when the war against Japan began. For the past eight years, they have been separated from their homes, displaced, lost the love of their parents, and lacked normal education. The harm to their physical and mental well-being is far greater than that of ordinary adults. It is urgent to restore their normal lives, regain family warmth, and enable them to grow and develop in a harmonious and peaceful environment. Therefore, all reconstruction work should focus on children. The distribution of relief materials should also be given priority to children. Not only should children who have been displaced to the rear be given priority to return to their homes, reunite with their relatives, and obtain a normal and stable life, but also the relief, education, and rehabilitation of children in the recovered areas are important issues for children's welfare. Commemorating Children's Day is not just a formality of perfunctorily responding to the occasion every year, but also to address these important issues, come up with plans, find solutions, and implement them practically.</p>
<p>(B) Expand the Scope and Actively Promote Healthcare and Protection: After the war ends, many children's care homes, orphanages, and educational institutions will be closed due to the children's return home. However, this does not mean that the scope of children's welfare work will be reduced. On the contrary, the children's care work during the war has come to an end, and other children's welfare undertakings are waiting to be developed. We, the colleagues engaged in children's welfare work, are only afraid of lacking the enthusiasm and perseverance to serve, but not afraid of lacking opportunities for work. However, from now on, children's welfare work must start from the two aspects of active healthcare and protection. For example, healthcare work is not only to treat children's diseases, to run a few clinics and sanatoriums, which is enough to be satisfied, but should also prevent problems before they occur, establish common sense for parents on raising children, and improve the public health of the entire society, so that children are fundamentally not infected with any diseases. As for protection, all evil habits in society that abuse children, such as child labor, maids, and child brides, should be eradicated without exception and not allowed to exist. Furthermore, all unreasonable, unequal, and undesirable phenomena in society should be eradicated, so that the elderly can live out their years, the strong can be employed, the young can grow, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, disabled, and sick can all be cared for, so that the entire society is filled with happiness, harmony, equality, freedom, and loving atmosphere, and becomes a perfect and ideal society. This is what those engaged in children's welfare and all social workers should strive for.</p>
<p>The wartime children's relief and education work has laid the foundation for China's children's welfare undertaking and has done its best to nurture the seedlings of the nation. This contribution to the country and the nation cannot be ignored. As the president of the China Child Welfare Association, I would like to express my deep respect and admiration to all child welfare comrades across the country. In the future, the development of children's welfare undertakings will be a hundred times more difficult than today. It is hoped that all compatriots across the country will clearly recognize the responsibility of this child welfare undertaking on this first Children's Day after the victory and enthusiastically support it, vigorously promote it, and complete the mission of nurturing children and restoring the nation.</p>

<h3>The Hong Kong Government Agrees to the Bank of China's Request to Recognize the New Hong Kong Notes, Totaling 87.5 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 3rd dispatch: The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) officially announced yesterday that it has obtained the consent of the Hong Kong government and has decided to recognize all banknotes bearing the name of HSBC as legal tender in Hong Kong. The British military government announced on September 13th of last year that all banknotes forcibly issued by the Japanese side were illegal. This declaration has now been revised.</p>
<p>United Press, Hong Kong, 3rd dispatch: The total amount of Hong Kong dollars issued under duress by the Japanese is 87.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US dollar in this city was stable, with narrow fluctuations. It strengthened slightly in the middle of the day, but the buying interest was weak. It soon became tired and fell, closing 25 yuan lower than the previous day. The arbitrage price against gold was squeezed to below 670 yuan. The exchange rate of the US dollar remained unchanged. Hong Kong notes were weak in the old notes but strong in the new notes. Because the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation considers all banknotes it issued to be valid, and the Hong Kong military authorities have also revised the September 13th ban on the circulation of new notes, the trend of exchanging old notes for new ones has become very popular. The new notes were initially quoted at 230 yuan, with more buyers than sellers, and could only be traded above 300 yuan. Guangbang received telegrams from that area stating that they were discounted at 98% or fully usable, reaching a maximum of 370 yuan. At this time, there was no distinction between the years 1936 and 1937, nor was there any distinction between the (1) and (2) prefixes. The old notes, due to the inflation component, fell back to the 400 yuan level. As a result, the old notes closed 25 yuan lower than the previous day, while the new notes rose 160 yuan. Robbie was 535 yuan, and Hong Kong telegrams were 435 yuan, all of which were selling orders.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Improve</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the buying interest in government bonds was strong again. People's hearts were restless. The C bonds opened in the morning and rose to above 2,600 yuan, once approaching the 3,000 yuan level. At noon, they hovered around 2,900 yuan, rising more than 400 yuan from the previous closing price. Miscellaneous bonds also improved by 150 to 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Show Elegance Upon Entering the Market, Chinese Stocks Have More Twists and Turns</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks initially opened flat and weak, but once recovered from weakness to strength after opening. Yongsha retreated from 4,950 yuan to 4,550 yuan, and Fuya retreated from 4,100 yuan to 3,700 yuan. The struggle was fierce, and the multi-party tried their best to maintain it, resulting in the concentration of Meiya and the inability to take care of Yongsha. Due to the relationship between the operators, Meiya's situation gradually improved. In the middle of the day, the police came to interfere, and trading was once suspended. It lingered until near noon, and the downward trend gradually changed. At noon, there was a trend of borrowing money to exchange for stocks, and all stocks closed at high prices, rising 150 yuan for Yongsha, 330 yuan for Meiya, and 15 to 20 yuan for Jingfu and other three small hot stocks compared with the previous closing price. The asking price was slightly lower in the afternoon, and the situation was uncertain. The old bulls were gradually emerging, but new bulls were joining from time to time. Foreign stocks showed elegance upon entering the market yesterday. After Xiangtai's continuous rise for many days, many parties have emerged yesterday. The situation also appeared uncertain in the middle of the day, and it briefly fell back from the high point in the morning, but it was still able to rebound at the noon closing. As a result, the paper industry rose by 20% alone compared with the previous closing price, Jardine Matheson remained unchanged, Xiangtai fell back by 10%, and the remaining stocks rose by 10% to 15%.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economy Orders a Crackdown [Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Ministry of Economy has ordered an investigation of the Shanghai stock market. All unregistered and unapproved companies and firms are not allowed to operate securities. If there are any secret transactions, they will be cracked down on according to law.</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Have Been Weak for Several Days, But They Started to Rebound Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market turned firm due to rain. After several days of weakness, things reached an extreme and rebounded. The Spring Festival closure is approaching, and the stores are preparing for sales, so the demand is quite good. As a result, both japonica and indica increased by 500 to 600 yuan, but white yuan still lagged behind by a thousand yuan. The trend of removing yuan is flat. However, the market in the interior is sluggish. Although the Shanghai market is rising, it may not last long. The closing price has already shown signs of softening. After the continuous decline in flour, the store sales have become active, rising by 300 to 400 yuan. After the sharp drop in the oil market, the retail has become active, rising by more than 3,000 yuan. However, there are still many Qingdao oil coming, so it will not rise too much. Soybeans are slightly tight, and soybean cakes and wheat bran have increased by 200 to 300 yuan along with the turnaround of various commodities. Corn is slightly less than 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Another news, according to the rice market, yesterday this city received a total of 8,800 shih of white japonica etc., including 4,025 shih of white japonica, 1,872 shih of 　 rice, 1,470 shih of early indica, 310 shih of sheep indica, 641 shih of Du indica, 40 shih of Wu indica, 295 shih of white yuan, and 206 shih of Yin yuan.</p>
<h3>The Huge Price of Wenzhou Longjing Tea is Shocking</h3>
<p>It is understood that the flag and gun green tea, commonly known as Longjing, which is sold exclusively to the domestic market and the surrounding areas, has had a good sales volume in recent years. According to the past practice, the new tea should appear on the market early, but unfortunately, this year, when the new tea was about to be produced, the weather was not mild, and it was entangled in continuous rain, so the output was greatly reduced, and all the payments were very large, so the cost of the tea farmers was quite expensive. It is now learned from the origin that the new Mingqian tea in Wenzhou has already been launched, and it can be shipped to Shanghai when the shipping schedule is close. However, the asking price is quite shocking. The Chao goods are priced at 30,000 yuan per dan. After roasting and shipping to Shanghai, the cost per dan must reach at least 260,000 to 270,000 yuan. As for the Yucha tea, Wenzhou, Hangzhou and other places will also gradually introduce new tea soon.</p>
<h3>Medium Sugar White Falls Weakly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was still weak in medium sugar and white sugar. The public association's bid was only 47,000 yuan to 47,250 yuan. The city sold another 49,000 yuan for the 　 white sugar and 52,000 yuan to 52,500 yuan for the 　 white sugar. The Shang 　 Qinghao offered 52,000 yuan for the goods with tax slips, which was still stable. The ordinary 　 Qing was 50,000 yuan, and the Xinghua Qing was 45,000 to 46,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Spinning and Construction Advance Delivery, Yarn Prices Rise and Fall Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market wanted to rise but was unable to. In the early morning, the 20-count yarns of each brand once shouted up 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, but there were not many transactions. Later, due to the announcement by the Spinning and Construction Company that the auction would be advanced and listed yesterday afternoon, people's hearts suddenly softened, and the price could not be sustained and fell. The Min and Guangdong gangs handled it slightly. The closing price was similar to the previous day. The Spinning and Construction yesterday reduced the auction price by 20,000 to 150,000 compared to the previous period. The 60-count yarn was devalued the most.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Trading is Slack</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York US cotton rose 7 to 14 points, with the near-term US dollar at 27.86, the far-term at 27.93, and the Mitterling spot at 28.46. The spot cotton trading in this port is still not improving. The reason is that gold and stocks have not developed much, and the yarn and cloth market is also soft, so many parties are waiting and watching. The Spinning and Construction Company and private yarn mills are also waiting and watching. Only the flower shops have a little decoration transaction, with the opening price of Mitterling at 78,000 to 80,000 yuan, and the price of Yuyao flower at 80,000 yuan. The above are all stock delivery prices.</p>
<h3>50,000 Dan of Basket Charcoal Arrive, and Pine Firewood Also Arrives in Swarms</h3>
<p>In the past half month, basket charcoal transported to Shanghai from Wenzhou and Huang　 and pine firewood from Hangzhou have been arriving in droves. According to unofficial estimates, more than 55,000 to 56,000 baskets of charcoal have been transported to Shanghai in the past half month, all transported by fire-type sailing ships, each carrying about 10,000 to 5,000 baskets. As for Hangzhou pine firewood, it is transported to Shanghai by the Shanghai-Hangzhou Fire Dong. Therefore, the reserve of firewood and charcoal in this city is gradually increasing. The market price of coal balls is still high, with top goods retailing for as much as 13,000 to 14,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Advocates Restoring Securities Trading First</h3>

<h3>West Hong Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>In the tung oil market, the township and village gangs continue to inquire, and the foreign firms are also very careful about the fullness, which makes people's hearts more and more firm. The holders are intent on selling only at tight prices. The price is standing firm. Among them, the West Hong tung oil has the largest advance in the market price due to the stagnant arrival of goods.</p>

<h3>Commercial Summary</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth: The opening in the morning was slightly higher, and insiders took the opportunity to sell in large quantities, resulting in a drop to the same price as yesterday. 　 Guangxie was reduced by another thousand yuan.

<h3>金價不易抬頭</h3>
<h3>Gold Prices Are Not Easy to Rise</h3>
<p>After yesterday's lower buying by silver money, (gold is acceptable for mortgaging), yesterday's buying remained busy, but high prices were still difficult to sustain. Mid-way many sales, and then the share market tired but revitalized, thus the holders would rather sell gold for share purchases again. Thus the drop. Yesterday's opening carried on the late night's momentum, breaking into the 15 million range, before struggling at 1,470,000. The well-funded silver money brokers absorbed, and those borrowing to buy shares also bought, as the price rose to 1,550,000. However, the 1,600,000 range is the price of the central bank sales and will be unable to shift in the near term, thus speculative buyers are not interested. Not moving forward, soon after the price retreated, before midday returning to the 15 million range. After lunch things settled, but the stock market used gold as collateral, but was unable to perform, with the result that a fall of 50,000, jewellery fell 165,000, bullion fell 1,000, silver fell 1,050, supply and demand was stable and level between a penny-6 and two pennies.</p>

<h3>Artificial Silk to be Sold by Auction on the Morning of the 6th</h3>
<p>The China Textile Construction Company originally scheduled to list and sell enemy property artificial silk yesterday morning.

According to Mr. Wu Weijing, deputy manager of the company, the principle of public sale of rayon has been determined and approved by Premier Zhu Ziwen.

<h3>Central Bank Seeks to Prevent Capital Flight; Foreign Banks to Periodically Halt Foreign Exchange Accounts; Various Countries to Assist in Suppressing Capital Flight Abroad</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the new foreign exchange measures, capital flight continues to occur.

At that time, all remaining balances in foreign exchange accounts must be transferred to the Central Bank and converted into legal tender at the official foreign exchange rate at that time, or converted into drafts for import settlement purposes. After September 30th, all Chinese and foreign banks will no longer be allowed to open foreign exchange deposit accounts. As for funds fleeing abroad, the central banks of various countries at the Bretton Woods Conference expressed their hope to cooperate and jointly curb foreign exchange speculation and capital flight. According to this international financial policy, various governments will assist our Central Bank to ensure that funds fleeing abroad are subject to the new foreign exchange measures stipulated by our government.

<h3>Hong Kong Gradually Returns to Normal</h3>
<p>[Washington, 2nd (US News Agency)] According to a report received yesterday by the International Trade Office of the Department of Commerce, the financial, commercial, and travel situation in Hong Kong has gradually improved in recent months. Hong Kong Island is now open for normal trade, with the exception of daily necessities that are in short supply. Hong Kong government officials hope to further relax trade restrictions as soon as possible. Before the war, Hong Kong Island was a completely free trade port. Under the current regulations, goods must obtain two types of permits for import. First, importers must apply to the Hong Kong Island Finance Department for a permit to purchase foreign exchange. After the application is approved, they must then request a second permit from Hong Kong Customs. Currently, the most needed goods in Hong Kong are food, clothing, building materials, timber, and medicines. Applications for US dollar foreign exchange for the import of luxury goods are often rejected. Since last November, London has been considering the return of former employees of Hong Kong trading companies. Until then, only bankers and United Nations people related to industrial organizations such as public utilities were allowed to return to Hong Kong Island. A spokesman for the Hong Kong military government stated that the Hong Kong government will hand over to non-military authorities as soon as the situation permits. The legal tender used on Hong Kong Island is banknotes issued by HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Chartered Bank. Currently, one US dollar is equivalent to 9.252 Hong Kong dollars.</p>

<h3>Northern Jiangsu People Silently Pray for Peace; Eagerly Hope That Huaiyin Group Will Succeed Thoroughly</h3>
<p>— Nantong, March 28th Communication, Yao Wei</p>
<p>Today, after a year of hard fighting, the people who have suffered enough all hope that the glory of victory can shine on every corner. The warmth of peace soothes everyone's heart. No more shadows of war, filling the beautiful landscape; no more gunshots and cannons, jarring the harmonious symphony of city sounds. Who doesn't yearn for this? Unless they are not human? Who wants civil strife? Unless they are man-eating beasts!</p>
<p>However, victory has come for more than seven months, and lamentations are everywhere. There are refugees who cannot return home. We want peace, and they want to live and work in peace. Therefore, after the news of the Peace Group of the Military Mediation Executive Department going to various places for inspection was released, everyone placed this hope, no, this ardent hope, on them.</p>
<p>The Xuzhou Group and the Huaiyin Group are one of the seventeen groups in the country. The composition of the group is the same as other groups. It is composed of representatives from the government, the Communist Party, and the United States. The US representative is Lieutenant Colonel Deng Ke, the government representatives are Colonel Xiao Fengqi, Colonel Yang Chao, and Major Wang Furong. The Communist Party representative is Colonel Han Nianlong, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Central China Region of the New Fourth Army, Lieutenant Colonel Yan Zhenheng, and Lieutenant Colonel Jiang Keding. There are also attached staff members, translators, etc., totaling more than ten people. Their itinerary is as follows: Except for the Communist Party representatives who were originally in Huaiyin, all personnel gathered in Huaiyin on March 8th, stayed for six days, and departed for Baoying and Gaoyou on the 11th, staying in Gaoyou. The next day, they went to Xinghua, the 13th to Dongtai, the 14th to Rubu stayed for two days, the 17th to Baibu, and the 18th to Nantong. As of today (March 28th) when the reporter is writing, they have not yet left Nantong.</p>
<p>Mediation Process</p>
<p>Starting from Huaiyin, the Communist Party first submitted Memorandum No. 1. Because it could not obtain the consent of the government side, the Baodi inspection began. Therefore, formal mediation talks and group meetings have not yet started. At the same time, because the principle of mediation is based on the ceasefire order of the Military Mediation Executive Department and Article 2 of Character No. 2, which stipulates that "the B side should be 60 li away from the city where the A side is stationed," although the Communist army's stationing locations are far from this provision, even if the government side repeatedly concedes, it is impossible to have a rapid approach to the talks. At the same time, based on the sincerity of the talks, the two sides have different compositions. There can be no satisfactory result. Naturally, the most important thing here belongs to the American representative, who is a compromiser, but according to what the reporter knows, he can only obtain the hope of one side separately from the government side or the Communist Party side, and the distance between these two hopes is often very far. If it is said that the mediation is absolutely based on principles, naturally this is easy for allies in the position of mediators to handle. The difficulty lies in the fact that principles are still principles, and facts are facts. Therefore, in terms of mediation, the reporter can only say that there has been such a process, but cannot say half a point of achievement. But up to Nantong, this is only the first difficulty encountered by the Huaiyin Group. After Nantong, there are still many places such as Haimen, not to mention Taixing, Jingjiang, Taixian, Yangzhou, etc. If they do not break through this first hurdle and reach the realm of peace, how will they continue this mediation work? According to representatives from both sides, "No one can take responsibility, and they have to ask their superiors for instructions"! Poor old people on the road to governance are praying for peace. How are they dedicating their hot hearts to the group? They are petitioning countless times, and the reality written in infinite blood, requesting a response from the group of peace angels, but is it possible? Does this continuous spring rain really forever bring us mourning faces, gloomy atmosphere, and muddy roads?</p>
<p>Memorandum Excerpts</p>
<p>In Huaiyin, the first memorandum was submitted by the Communist Party, with three articles regarding the stationing issue in Baibu Town, the midpoint of Rugao and Nantong. According to the current location of Baibu Town, which belongs to the government's stationed area, the Communist Party's hope is: "Please immediately order the national army that has advanced 50 li north and to Baibu Town to immediately withdraw north of Pingchao and Baibu Town and return to the original defense of Nantong," which means that the national army can only be stationed in the urban area of Nantong, which means that only one "point" of control can exist. Naturally, it is not easy for the government to accept.</p>
<p>To Rugao Station, the Rugao County Government submitted Memorandum No. 1. In addition to the description of the struggle for strongholds, there are approximately two requirements in the request items: (1) Rugao should be returned to the government for demobilization, (2) The former Rugao County Magistrate and county government staff should be released, (3) No more public grain should be collected, legal tender should not be rejected, and the use of anti-currency and self-made stamps should be stopped immediately. These requirements are based on certain facts. The following is a brief description of the process of Peng Fuzhong, the former Rugao County Magistrate, coming to Rugao to return to work and being captured: Since the arrival of victory, County Magistrate Peng went to Rugao on September 14th, 34th year of the Republic to return to work, and began to take over on the 16th, but gunshots were intensive in the suburbs and traffic was cut off, and the Communist army began shooting. The Rugao garrison troops were the county security regiment and the Independent First Brigade of the Second Route Army, which returned fire for self-defense. On the 21st, the Communist army reinforced again, and the troops and puppet army of the Japanese prisoners of war attacked fiercely, and broke into the city at about 1:00 p.m. Therefore, the county government staff below Peng, the former county magistrate, were mostly captured.</p>
<p>The second is the memorandum submitted by the government troops currently stationed in Nantong to the executive group, which is a report on the Communist troops' violation of the ceasefire order, occupying Lingdian Port, attacking and tying Baibu Town, blockading materials, and obstructing traffic. Its hopes are approximately as follows: (1) Restore the connection between Nantong and Haimen, because the Communist army is stationed along the Haitong Highway, harassing everywhere, so that traffic is cut off, (2) Eliminate material blockade, the Communist army freezes the materials in the occupied area, strictly prohibiting the people's materials from being transported out of the Communist army's defense zone, so that the prices of Nantong Haimen are soaring, and food and fuel are even more scarce, (3) Please order the Communist army to thoroughly obey the ceasefire order and not to attack Lingdian Port and other places guarded by local troops again, (4) The Communist army should withdraw from the encirclement of Nantong, Baibu Town, and Haimen, and the Communist army has long completed the encirclement posture of Haimen Nantong Baibu and other places, and is gradually approaching, (5) Return Lingdian Port, it was found that Lingdian Port was not a Communist-controlled area before the ceasefire agreement. This time, the Qidong County Government temporarily stationed at Lingdian Port on the border of Haimen because it was afraid of causing conflicts by stationing in the Qidong county seat for demobilization work, and the Communist army launched an attack and fiercely occupied it. This memorandum can be said to be largely based on the Communist army's failure to abide by the ceasefire order.</p>
<p>The first memorandum submitted by the Nantong County Government has requirements in the stationed area of the troops: (1) The Communist army should withdraw 60 li outside Nantong County, that is, the Communist army should abide by the ceasefire order and Word No. 2 to withdraw from Liuqiao, Shigang, Jinsha, Erjia Town, Zhangzhishan, Maozhen and other places, (2) Within 60 li outside Nantong City, it is the government army's activity area, and the Communist army should not come to harass again, (3) The junction of 60 li should be used as a buffer zone. Administrative security issues should be handled through consultation between the two parties. The central legal tender should be used for the currency system, and goods should be allowed to exchange in and out. Neither party should blockade. The second is to repair the Tonghai Highway and release government staff (according to the Communist army, more than ten village heads and village team leaders appointed by the government have been arrested).</p>
<p>People's Voices</p>
<p>The first item is the report of the Rugao County People's Organization, which lists: 1. The crimes of the Communist army against the people, 2. The process of County Magistrate Peng being captured when Rugao returned to office, 3. The return of Baibu, 4. The situation of the Communist army attacking Baibu after the ceasefire order was issued. 5. The situation of the Communist army disturbing the local area after the ceasefire order was issued. 6. Exposing the Communist Party's conspiracy to coerce the people to demand the "liberation of Baibu," etc., is extremely detailed, and it is impossible to write it out completely due to space limitations to fulfill the responsibility of reporting. Now, only their petitions and hopes are written as follows: Immediately release Peng Zhiben, the head of the county and county government staff who were arrested on September 21st of the 34th year of the Republic, 2. Immediately release the gentry of Rugao County who were arrested. 3. Immediately stop the Communist Party from confiscating the property of the Kuomintang between Matang and Juegang, and return the property of the people that has been confiscated and extorted. 4. No blockade of materials, forced collection of public grain. 5. Restore traffic immediately. 6. No rejection of legal tender. 7. Rugao must be demobilized. 8. The Communist army should withdraw from Rugao County. 9. Illegal arrests of people are not allowed.</p>
<p>The second is the petition memorandum signed and stamped by 4,000 representatives of the people in the first district of Nantong County, which contains more than ten main points, the main idea is to restore traffic, lift the blockade of food and grass in Nantong, and strictly implement the ceasefire order and Word No. 2, etc. In short, it is mainly to live and work in peace.</p>

<h3>The 18th Meeting of the Political Participation Council Passes Military Report Resolution</h3>
<p>[Chongqing, 2nd (Central News Agency)] At the 18th meeting of the Political Participation Council on the 1st, a resolution on the military report was passed. The full text is as follows: This council reviewed the military and political aspects of the work report of the Executive Yuan, and listened to the oral report of the ministry. It was learned that the military and political authorities have planned and gradually implemented matters such as surrendering, capturing, demobilizing and reorganizing the army, and improving treatment. In addition to the joy of colleagues, there are still things that cannot be said, and special opinions are presented on the left:</p>
<h3>Expedite the Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners and Assess the Collected Materials</h3>
<p>(1) Enemy prisoners should be sent back to their country as soon as possible. There are no less than one million enemy prisoners in China. Except for those who have been sent back to their country, there are still many. At this time of food panic, it is not appropriate to let these Japanese prisoners stay in the country for a long time and waste people's food. The government should be asked to send them back to their country as soon as possible. (2) There should be an assessment of the collection of enemy military materials. Since the surrender of the enemy army, the reception personnel dispatched by the government have not lacked those who are honest and law-abiding and have done their best, but the general phenomenon is that there are many malpractices and disturbances are rampant. Among them, military and political reception personnel are not all self-loving people, and there are many places that give people excuses. The military and political authorities should strictly assess the types and quantities of materials received by the various armies, as well as the situation of storage and use. Personnel involved in malpractice should also be punished according to law to clarify rewards and punishments. The rectification of military discipline is the key to rectifying and building the army. The military and political authorities should strive for performance in this.</p>
<h3>Simplify Military Institutions and Settle Redundant Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>(5) Military administrative institutions should be further simplified. The division of agencies and different responsibilities are the diseases of administration. Military institutions also suffer from this problem. They are often not connected to relevant institutions, which affects efficiency. The government has already made some improvements in this regard, and it is especially appropriate to further simplify the overlapping military and political institutions to achieve the effect of unity and strengthening. (4) The demobilization of the army should be coordinated with national construction. After the war, how to settle the officers and soldiers of the army who will be demobilized and discharged in stages, which will be millions of people, should be coordinated with the national construction plan. For example, if a certain place is managing rivers and repairing roads, the redundant officers and soldiers in that place should be trained to engage in such work. It is not appropriate to recruit civilian laborers separately, so that the redundant officers and soldiers still have to find other settlements, and each does not conspire with each other. The fundamental plan lies in the rapid development of various construction undertakings and the simultaneous consideration of the livelihood of officers and soldiers, and social hidden dangers can also be eliminated immediately.</p>
<h3>Improve the Conscription System and Research Military Academics</h3>
<p>(5) The standing army after the completion of the army reorganization should collect strong men for military service in accordance with the conscription law. The number of standing army after the army reorganization is small. It should be collected in accordance with the provisions of the conscription law as a demonstration of conscription. It should not be convenient for a while and still recruit, so that the conscription system can never be soundly established. (6) New weapons and military academics, research should strive for advancement. Not only is the equipment of the Chinese army incomplete, but weapons and academics are even more backward. Efforts should be made to advance in all aspects of education, training, and military industry in order to catch up with advanced countries. (7) Honored veterans should be properly resettled. Honored veterans sacrifice for the country and contribute to the country. The government should properly plan and improve methods for their rehabilitation, return to their hometowns for employment, and compensation, so that each can get what they deserve to show the country's intention to respect morality and reward merit.</p>
<h3>Build an Air Force and Navy and Stabilize Social Order</h3>
<p>(8) The construction of the air force and navy should be prepared immediately. Modernized military land, sea, and air forces are equally important. The construction of the Chinese army has a certain scale. In the future, in addition to reorganizing the army and increasing its strength, efforts should be made to enrich the air force and establish the navy in order to promote the national defense construction at the same time. Moreover, this conference believes that military and political construction is almost due to the stability of the national and social order, the restoration of transportation, and the unification of the world. The cessation of conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communist armies is a prerequisite. Now the national army has obeyed the order to cease fire, but the Communist army is besieging cities and seizing land, and it is still not stopping. If this continues, it will affect the overall military and political construction plan. I sincerely hope that the government will quickly seek a proper solution to rescue the people from fire and water, so that the military and political construction plan can also be implemented smoothly. The country is very fortunate.</p>

<h3>Applying the Encouragement of Industry Through Spring Outings: The Grandeur of the Flower Fair in Chengdu in March at Qingyang Palace and Erxian Temple</h3>
<p>— Chengdu, March 28th, Airmail Dispatch, Sent by Zhou Yangquan</p>
<p>Chengdu in March is a city of flowers. Plum blossoms have faded, peach blossoms have bloomed, peach blossoms have faded, and roses are in full bloom. Especially recently, it is the lively season for the flower fair in the west of the city.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chengdu's trade fairs, they have a history of thousands of years, passed down from the late Tang Dynasty and the Former and Later Shu kingdoms, continuing to this day. It wasn't until the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign that the local authorities renamed it the "Industrial Encouragement Fair" to promote industry and commerce. Following old customs, the government took charge, collecting products from various counties for display. At the end of the fair, they would assess and award prizes to encourage participation, making it a very meaningful gathering. During the War of Resistance, there were one or two large-scale events, but in other years, people gathered on their own, on a smaller scale. Last year was particularly lackluster, with most participating businesses losing money. This year, the Chengdu Municipal Government is supervising and managing the fair, so hopefully, it won't disappoint people again.</p>
<p>The fairgrounds are located inside and outside of Qingyang Palace and Erxian Temple, about a mile outside the New West Gate, covering an area of about fifty acres. The space is rented to merchants at a price of 8,600 yuan per square zhang (unit of area) at most and 4,000 yuan at least. They can rent as much as they need, and with an additional 10,000 yuan for erecting a temporary shed, they can do short-term business.</p>
<p>A Small Temporary Society</p>
<p>According to the person in charge's statistics, the various categories participating in this flower fair include over a hundred snack shops, fifty teahouses, seven theaters and amusement venues, fifty toy stores, over two hundred cigarette shops, over sixty wood and bamboo ware shops, over ten porcelain shops, over forty flower nurseries, and over a hundred other miscellaneous businesses. It's truly a small, temporary society here. They have come from hundreds or thousands of miles away to participate. Earning profit is only a small part of their purpose because in Chengdu, the custom is to enjoy leisure, and the element of leisure surpasses that of making money! In the center of the fairgrounds is the municipal government's reception area, which serves as the administrative hub of the Industrial Encouragement Fair. They are divided into hygiene, construction, site management, general affairs, and public relations groups, responsible for managing this large venue (which is actually a market). As for security and fire prevention, a joint military, police, and gendarmerie command has been established for overall management.</p>
<p>Touching the Green Goat Cures All Ills</p>
<p>The opening ceremony coincided with a pilgrimage period (mid-lunar month). Those devout men and women gathered in groups from all over. The two temples were filled with swirling incense smoke and warm candlelight. They scrambled to worship, especially crowding around the two bronze green goats, which have been touched until they gleam with gold. It is said that touching the green goat can cure all illnesses; touching the head for headaches, touching the leg for leg pain. What a laughable and pitiable foolish act!</p>
<p>The Effects of Industrial Encouragement are Still Slight</p>
<p>The weather is mild and sunny. At midday, tens of thousands of people, young and old, male and female, gather from all directions to join the fun and seek enjoyment. The narrow sidewalks are truly packed, with people flowing like a river, wave after wave. One can fully see Chengdu people's interest in leisure. They put on their New Year's attire and spend money without hesitation, seeking their own enjoyment. Although the municipal authorities have announced that they are applying the encouragement of industry through leisure, the effect on industrial encouragement seems too slight.</p>
<p>Flower Windmills Fly Through the Streets</p>
<p>The Chengdu Tap Water Company, in collaboration with the Provincial Experimental Elementary School, has created a set of models of the water supply process, which is the most distinctive exhibit at the fair. The local products from various counties in the Industrial Hall and the finished products exhibition of the Jiahua Cement Factory also add a lot of color to the event. Those "Wenjiang Douyou" (soybean oil), "Pixian Douban" (fermented broad bean paste), "Dongzikou Liangfen" (mung bean jelly), "Xindu Yierba" (glutinous rice cakes), and "Renshou Mabing" (sesame seed cakes), are everywhere, smiling at customers!</p>
<p>As the sun sets in the west, almost every tourist loves to go home with a paper flower windmill, dragging their tired bodies. As a result, flower windmills are flying everywhere in the streets and alleys, at the mercy of the spring breeze. This gathering will continue until the end of the lunar March before gradually dispersing. (28th)</p>

<h3>An Urgent Appeal for the Precarious Dike at Jinshanwei!</h3>
<p>— Hou Wuji</p>
<p>Our Jinshanwei seawall in Songjiang has been quite sturdy since its construction in 1934. However, since the beginning of the War of Resistance, the Jinshanwei area was a landing site for enemy forces. Over the years, the dike body has eroded severely, and with the tidal water scouring it day and night, it now poses a serious threat. The last line of defense (the stone dike) is also exposed. The consequences are truly unthinkable!</p>
<p>Ever since the enemy surrendered, men of insight in Songjiang have been eager to make repairing the precarious dike at Jinshanwei a priority. However, given the nation's difficulties, they feared their wishes would not be fulfilled. Later, they heard that the Relief Administration's Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch had sent a letter to the Songjiang Relief Association, ordering swift repairs, with all expenses to be paid by the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch. Upon hearing this, they rejoiced repeatedly. However, they recently learned that the project consists of only "filling with soil"! Therefore, they cannot help but make an urgent appeal to all public figures and community leaders.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the seawall constructed in 1934 used tilted-slope rock throwing, one-bridge-one-stone, two-pile-two-stone, and three-pile-three-stone methods, etc., depending on the severity of the threat, and never considered "filling with soil" as a permanent solution. Now, after surviving the calamity, repairing the seawall with only "filling with soil" to complete the task is something that no one can agree with. It cannot withstand even a day of tidal erosion! As for the repair costs, since they are paid by the Relief Administration Branch, this is the best opportunity. How to make the project sturdy and long-lasting is important, but "filling with soil" is merely a temporary fix! Considering the current critical situation at Jinshanwei, it is even more serious than in 1934. After an on-site inspection, one's hair stands on end in fear. It is sincerely hoped that all public figures will order the start of construction immediately to solidify the project and eliminate this great danger. Otherwise, once an accident occurs, it will be vastly different from the breach of the Haining dike.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the plum rain season is approaching. Judging from past years, there are often typhoons. The waves crash down, carrying everything with them. Life hangs by a thread, and nothing is more frightening than this. Therefore, the project must be completed before the plum rain season, so that Jinshanwei does not follow closely after the Haining accident. As for which type of construction should be chosen, it is the responsibility of the technicians. For the sake of the people's lives and local safety, it is necessary to urgently appeal for the sympathy of the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch and community leaders so that the disaster prevention work can be completed as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Children's Health Competition and Physical Examination</h3>
<p>— Su Huixiang</p>
<p>Dr. Su Huixiang is a pediatric specialist who studied in Germany and has extensive experience in treating children's diseases. She has recently been appointed by the Municipal Health Bureau as the director of the Shanghai Municipal Children's Hospital, and will surely make new contributions to the health of children in this city. We are very honored that Director Su has written this article for our newspaper on Children's Day. —Editor</p>
<p>Everyone is especially happy on this first Children's Day after the victory, so the Municipal Government, Health Bureau, Municipal Party Department, Women's Movement Committee, and other organizations have jointly organized a children's health competition. The purpose is to promote public awareness of children's health and strengthen the foundation of the country, which is very meaningful.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, the Chinese Infant Education Association and the Xinxin Company both held children's health competitions. During the War of Resistance, the Young Women's Christian Association also held children's health competitions every Children's Day. As a pediatrician, Huixiang has been volunteering to examine and judge these competitions every year, which is a fulfilling and happy thing for me, so I have gained some experience in children's health competitions.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the purpose of holding health competitions and participating in them seems to be not entirely the same. Looking at the examination forms, they are detailed and comprehensive, examining everything from the skin to the internal organs, to check whether the child is sick or not, and not just to give awards. However, the parents participating in the competition are mostly aiming to win awards. It is common to see a family with four or five children, specifically picking out the ones with the hope of winning to participate in the competition, while those who really need a physical examination are left at home. A gentleman once said a few years ago at the Young Women's Christian Association that we should have an "unhealthy" competition. This was said because he felt that since so much time, energy, and money had been spent, it should be done in a way that could achieve the greatest results.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that health competitions and physical examinations are two different things. In the current situation, in addition to holding children's health competitions on Children's Day, all institutions across the country should be required to have all children in the country undergo thorough physical examinations by doctors within a certain period of time, and the state should provide partial or free diagnosis and treatment for those found to have diseases during this period in order to provide preferential treatment. If this can be done, then in five years, the health knowledge of the people across the country will surely be greatly improved, and the health of children across the country will surely be improved. In this way, in twenty years, we will not find it difficult to wash away the shame of being the "Sick Man of East Asia" and can permanently maintain this glorious victory!</p>

<h3>My Plea on Behalf of Children – A Word to Society on Children's Day –</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>For this first Children's Day after the victory, I don't want to write the usual timely pieces such as "The Meaning of Children's Day" or "Reflections on Children's Day." But I cannot suppress the emotions swelling in my heart, and I must make a plea to society on behalf of pure and innocent children.</p>
<p>I think no one can deny that our society's treatment of children is extremely unreasonable. At least more than half of the children in China live extremely miserable lives. They have no independent rights; they are merely appendages of adults. The long period after a child is born that requires education and nurturing is almost entirely entrusted to ignorant and incompetent parents who do not understand proper methods of education. Of course, we cannot say that there are no enlightened and virtuous parents who can shoulder the responsibility of raising their children, but they are ultimately very few. Except for the extremely fortunate children, most do not have the opportunity to receive appropriate education and nurturing. The most precious period of childhood is spent in the shadows, without sunlight.</p>
<p>Currently, all countries around the world have explicit laws regarding the protection of children, with the aim of safeguarding children's rights and ensuring that the future generations of nations receive reasonable care. Countries like England, America, and the Soviet Union operate their children's welfare programs through the state, and the enthusiastic efforts of the Prussian people in child welfare work are even more admirable. However, looking back at our country, although the rights of children are affirmed in law, the general public in society still treats children with indifference. Child abuse is commonplace. Parents can treat their children as outlets for venting frustration, arbitrarily beating and scolding them. Apprentices in shops are often subjected to the cruel and tyrannical power of their bosses. Children of fifteen or sixteen, whose development is not yet complete, engage in the profession of pulling carts for a living, without any prohibition from the authorities. Even in Shanghai, a city renowned for its education and culture, the evil practice of infanticide is still heard of from time to time, and it is not considered a crime. According to statistical reports, children account for the majority of cases involving the sale of human beings. Such deprivation of children's right to survival in society is truly chilling.</p>
<p>Now, advanced countries in Europe and America are making every effort to promote "parental education," hoping that every parent will possess the knowledge and skills to raise children, using an objective and scientific attitude to solve important issues in children's physical and psychological development. Although our country has also adopted this progressive idea in recent years, it is not yet widespread. Most parents still use traditional and unreasonable methods to educate their children (rather than educating children, it is more accurate to say that they are managing them). These ignorant and unknowing parents first and foremost do not have a correct understanding of the relationship between parents and children, treating their children as private property, unaware that they are individuals with a definite social status. While others train children based on the principles of mental hygiene, using positive suggestions and encouragement to correct children's bad habits, studying children's thoughts and behaviors from the perspective of their physical and mental development, heredity, and environment, most parents in our ancient country, which claims five thousand years of civilization, not only fail to give their children appropriate "love," but also harm their fragile hearts in various ways. Restraint, corporal punishment, scolding, and ridicule have become the main means of educating children. They never think that these are negative and ineffective methods, and at the same time, the most unreasonable and unenlightened methods. Important issues such as childcare hygiene, medicine, and health products are naturally beyond the understanding of those ignorant parents, and thus the happiness of their children is invisibly ruined. As for some who consider themselves new women, they entrust the task of raising their children to maids, and the children receive no good upbringing at all. On the other hand, in addition to strict restraints, corporal punishment, and scolding, there is also the phenomenon of excessive indulgence towards children. Children are spoiled and pampered, making it difficult for them to adapt to life later on.</p>
<p>The eight years of war have deprived many children of their means of living. It was reported the other day that there are currently millions of wandering children struggling on the brink of life and death, awaiting assistance and relief. This again makes us think of the extremely serious problem of juvenile delinquency. Children who do not receive good education and nurturing from society, families, and schools are bound to embark on a path of crime. However, our country treats juvenile offenders in the same way as adults, which greatly affects their physical and mental well-being. Countries such as Europe and America now have facilities called "juvenile delinquency reformatories," which are dedicated to providing active guidance to children who have committed crimes. However, our country does not have such a reasonable organization. Children who commit minor offenses are imprisoned and placed together with adult criminals, where they are subjected to their negative suggestions, leading to further degradation. Now that there are so many children facing death and exile, if effective relief methods are not quickly planned, these millions of children will either die out or become candidates for criminals. During this war, England always evacuated children to the suburbs before military operations began in various places, and the United States also implemented thorough measures to ensure the safety of children during wartime, but our country is not concerned about improving this situation. Most of the wandering children, if not handled properly, will have their young shoots of national life destroyed for no reason. Furthermore, if these children become criminals due to poor education and nurturing, then our conscience will be severely tested: Who caused these innocent children to commit crimes? Who is responsible for the moral degradation of these children?</p>
<p>Threats to children's safety and health are also very serious. Most schools cannot provide children with a reasonable living environment, allowing them to live in places with insufficient light and polluted air. The standards of health education and hygiene facilities are very poor, so that children's fragile bodies and minds are easily infected with diseases. Even in Shanghai alone, more than 60% of school children are physically weak, according to statistics from the health authorities, and the actual percentage is probably even higher. Going into the "alley schools" (弄堂學校) for a look, the equipment does not meet sanitary principles, which is simply unimaginable. As for life outside of school, children spend all day wandering on the streets or sitting on the curbs watching "little books," absorbing the toxic elements of the mystical and lewd from comics with impure ideas. This has a very bad effect on their physical and mental well-being. Society lacks places specifically for children to play. A healthy spiritual life (including cultural life) is lacking, and the issue of safety is also very serious. Looking at the children's parks, children's playgrounds, children's libraries, and various other children's welfare programs established everywhere else, what are our thoughts! For the urgent needs of children's physical and mental well-being, to save them from the suffering they are experiencing physically and mentally, I must make a plea for them here!</p>
<p>I first ask that society change its traditional attitude towards children and no longer ignore the education and nurturing of children, which is more important than anything else. We must respect children's independent personality and rights. "The 20th century is the century of the child." We should recognize the value of Aikey's (愛偷凱) words. Children are not miniature adults. They should have their own world of activities. We cannot hinder their normal physical and mental development with passive prohibitions, and we must not use beating, corporal punishment, scolding, and various other unreasonable methods of punishment to destroy their physical and mental health and deprive them of their innate rights. It is wrong to expect children to conform to adult judgments, habits, and thoughts.</p>
<p>We also hope that the legal protection of children will not become a mere formality, and that significant progress will be made in the advancement of children's welfare programs. We must completely correct the erroneous views that society has held about children in the past. At the same time, families and schools should establish close ties and jointly assume the responsibility of protecting and nurturing children. Enlightened people in society, virtuous parents, and progressive teachers can work together to cultivate future "members of society," irrigate the fresh cells of the nation, and then China's future will have hope of revival!</p>

<p>We should value children and not make hasty judgments about their actions and words. — Luo Xun</p>
<p>The fate of a child is determined by the mother. — Napoleon</p>
<p>Some people often make this mistake in the education of their children: they focus on the physical well-being of girls while neglecting their intellectual development; they focus on the intellectual development of boys while neglecting their physical well-being. — Hugh</p>

<h3>Homemade Small Work Pants</h3>
<p>— Nian Shufang</p>
<p>Loving beauty is a natural instinct, especially for girls. When they go to school, they always want their clothes to be more beautiful and special than those of other children. Wealthy people don't need to worry; they can buy whatever they want. But ordinary people can't do that. Why don't we take advantage of our free time to make them ourselves? Children will definitely especially love the artistic clothes made by their own mothers.</p>
<p>The dimensions (in feet) in the diagram are suitable for a five- or six-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Materials: It is best to use woolen material, which can be made from old cheongsams or skirts, or ordinary sturdy fabrics.</p>
<p>Instructions: Cut according to the dimensions in the diagram. First sew the pant legs, then attach the chest piece at the front. Add a wide elastic band at the back of the waistband to make them more fitted and eliminate the need to open and button on the side, making them easier to put on and take off. Then add a belt. The most important thing is to find some unique patterns and embroider them on the chest and pockets to make the whole pair of pants look brand new and different from those bought in the market.</p>

<h3>Using National Resources to Establish Nurseries: An Appeal from a Female Staff Member</h3>
<p>— Yimo</p>
<p>A maid in my household, surnamed Xu, was in charge of taking care of my child. Some time ago, she left her job because her child died of smallpox. When she tearfully resigned from her job, I truly blamed heaven for being unfair. Accompanying her tears, I didn't know how to comfort her. Alas! Everyone cherishes their own children. "Abandoning one's own field to cultivate another's" resulted in this. How can people not feel sympathy?</p>
<p>It turned out that she had abandoned her child because of hunger, while I could not take care of my child because of my work. Forced by circumstances, each had their own difficulties. From this, I thought of the Soviet Union's nursery system, which is truly the source of its national strength. Consider that the Soviet revolution is only twenty-eight years old; yet many of its talents today are products of the nurseries of that time. Its importance today is no accident. Therefore, we should learn from others' strengths to make up for our own shortcomings, quickly grasp reality to create the future.</p>
<p>I am now the mother of two children – twins. Because I am a small clerk in the post office, I have eight hours of work every day. The children's affairs are simply entrusted to the maid. I ask, what is the impact on children who spend all day mingling with maids? "If dyed in indigo, it becomes indigo; if dyed in yellow, it becomes yellow." As a result, not only do they not make progress in knowledge, but they also learn many bad habits; they develop some bad tempers; care is even more out of the question. Everyone wants their children to be good, with their physical and mental strength increasing day by day. But in this situation, what can a mother do? Apart from "doing my utmost," I can only feel dejected. As we often say, children are the masters of tomorrow, and the nannies of our second-generation masters are indeed working hard to fulfill their responsibilities!</p>
<p>Today, the Chinese nation, which has the largest population but lacks substance, should change its course regarding national strength based on the painful experiences it has encountered over the years. Identify the center of gravity of the nation, "save the children." Otherwise, if we pursue the branch instead of the root, even if we of this generation can turn things around and become prosperous and strong, if the successors are unworthy, they will still not be able to carry on the past and open up the future. Wouldn't we be wasting our efforts?</p>
<p>It is said that there are only nurseries in Shanghai and Chongqing. This is only a temporary measure taken by local people, the happiness of a few children. What we hope for is to establish them with national resources. Of course, given the national strength after the war, there are many things to be done. We do not expect to establish them universally all at once. But as politics gradually gets back on track, military spending will inevitably decrease after the reorganization of the army. Why not transfer a small part of this savings to child welfare funds? In the future, the Ministry of Education can designate public schools to attach kindergartens and nurseries according to local conditions, or the Ministry of Social Affairs can handle them separately. Everything depends on human effort. It takes ten years to grow a tree, and a hundred years to cultivate a person. The children are fortunate! The mothers are fortunate! (Respectful salutation)</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>Starting with Snot</h3>
<p>— Zhongyi</p>
<p>Here, let me tell you a joke first.</p>
<p>Xiao Mi is already five years old, but he doesn't understand cleanliness at all. He constantly trails two lines of purulent snot, simply unwilling to wipe them. One day, his mother said:</p>
<p>"Xiao Mi, look how filthy you are! Quickly wipe off your snot, and I'll buy you candy in a little while!"</p>
<p>Xiao Mi is very "well-behaved" and immediately sucks the snot back into his nostrils. But in less than a minute, he starts pestering his mother for candy! Mom gently slapped him and said:</p>
<p>"You really want to eat candy! I was just teasing you!"</p>
<p>Xiao Mi doesn't make a fuss anymore, but immediately lets the snot flow down again and says with a smile:</p>
<p>"I'm teasing you too!"</p>
<p>Sir, you laughed, didn't you? That's right, this is a joke. However, rather than saying it's a "joke," I think it would be more accurate to call it a "crying joke"!</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that in Chinese society, there is a serious lack of mothers who truly understand and are willing to study how to educate their children! When ordinary mothers discover that their children have made mistakes, they either indulge them completely or beat and scold them desperately. Further, some mothers simply entrust their children entirely to servants, regardless of whether they go east or west, simply holding the principle of not caring! In fact, everyone knows that it is not advisable to indulge children with "my precious darlings" and let them do whatever they want. Similarly, constantly scolding them with "little devils! Dead people!" or even "slapping!" and exercising their fists is not the way. Furthermore, the policy of "you are you, I am me" is even more absurd! However, unfortunately, the facts will tell you that "knowing full well, still committing" is a common phenomenon; most mothers still adopt the policy that cannot escape the category of "beating," "scolding," or "not scolding and not asking"!</p>
<p>Although there are different policies from the above types, for example, isn't the "teasing you" technique quite remarkable? Human nature is greedy! By taking advantage of this "greed," you can trick people. It goes without saying that mothers tricking their children is even easier! Candy, money, making new clothes, buying foreign dolls... which one can't stir the child's heart? So mothers "tease you" today and "tease you" tomorrow, finally forging children, one by one, in a long-term deceptive environment, stimulating the innocent psychology and leading to "precocious adulthood"! Like Xiao Mi, they all know how to deal with other people's tricks and how to trick people! In other words, they are deeply knowledgeable! Sir, please think about it! Letting children discard their precious "innocence" and become "old" at the age of five, six, seven, or eight, is this a good phenomenon or a bad phenomenon? At least, I erroneously argue that this is contrary to nature! Is it? Then, are we still prepared to manufacture "deception" intentionally? Manufacture "jokes"?</p>
<p>No! Mothers of the world, for the sake of your second generation, for the sake of yourselves, stop thoughtlessly destroying your "products"! Adopt proper guiding methods to educate your children!</p>
<h3>Song of the Child Bride</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>"Being a child bride is more bitter than anything; dragging slippers, the mother-in-law scolds every month; the eldest aunt next door couldn't bear it, made a pair of shoes to give me. I spin yarn day and night until past midnight, so hungry I can't stand it, stealing some pickled vegetables to fill my stomach; eagerly awaiting the New Year's Eve."</p>
<p>The above is a folk song about child brides. From this song, we can see what kind of life child brides generally live. How can we eradicate the bad habit of raising child brides in China for thousands of years? How can we improve the lives of child brides today? This is a question that those who pay attention to Chinese family problems should study.</p>

<h3>Psychological Obstacles for Women to Expand Social Work [Part 1]</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cai</p>
<p>Those who generally study women's issues feel that women cannot expand into vast social work like men, and cannot take social undertakings as their lifelong careers. It's not that they can't get involved, but they give up halfway. There are very few who devote their lifelong energy to a certain career. Therefore, some people take a male-centered stance and hold a prejudice, thinking that women's intelligence and ability are not as good as men's, and that innate limitations mean that women can only raise children and manage the home, forever only being in a position dominated by men. Those who hold this view include the great 19th-century philosopher Schopenhauer. Even Aristotle thought that women were inferior to men. He said that one of the reasons for the destruction of Sparta was that women had the right to inherit property, because this gave them great independence, which led the people of Sparta into an unfortunate situation. Also, in modern times, Hitler strongly advocated that women return to the kitchen. Although this contained the political function of the Nazi Party, it was all based on the same mistake of despising women's opportunities and depriving women of their independent, free position and personality. These views have now been proven from the physiological and psychological aspects to prove that there is no difference in innate superiority between men and women, and we don't need to refute these arguments. Because the evidence of scientific facts naturally trumps any rhetoric. However, standing from the perspective of women, we cannot deny the fact that women cannot participate in social work like men, expand social work, and take social work as their lifelong careers. As far as the current situation in Chinese society is concerned, in recent years, it has been a very common phenomenon that higher education allows women to have the same opportunities as men, but the number of women who are truly able to take social service as their lifelong careers is compared to the number of educated women, although no one has conducted an objective survey on this matter yet, but according to our estimates, the proportion must be quite small. So, what other reasons are there for women's inability to keep pace with men in social work, besides denying that their intelligence and ability are inferior to men? Up until now, the forces of male-centered society have been preserved extremely powerfully, and all departments of society still give women various obstacles, preventing women from entering and leaving various departments of society as freely as men. This social resistance is sufficient to prevent women from expanding their work like men. However, in addition to social resistance, there are also psychological reasons for women's difficulty in expanding social work. This article puts aside social reasons and only explains why women cannot expand social work from the perspective of psychological reasons.</p>
<p>I believe that psychological reasons are one of the greatest obstacles for women to expand social work. Because if women themselves truly have the perseverance and courage to overcome social difficulties, then social resistance will not be enough to prevent women from participating in social undertakings, and even less to prevent women from taking social undertakings as their lifelong careers. Dr. Ellis, an expert in women's psychology, once believed that women are unable to overcome environmental difficulties to create an outstanding figure like Bacon and Ibsen, which also means that the reason why there are so few scientists and artists is still due to psychological reasons.</p>
