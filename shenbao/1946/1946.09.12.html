<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕冀熱邊境之國軍，於收復喜峯口古北口後，昨續收復長城沿綫之另一重要關口南天門，繼續沿畏城西進，昨與收復古北口之部隊會師，至此長城之各重要關口，殆均收復，所餘者僅馬蘭峪，國軍亦已進抵其北方十七華里地方。迫入遵化平谷山岳地帶之共軍李運昌主力，已四面受敵，向遵化平谷壓縮之各路部隊，西路昨收復薊縣南之邦均鎮及上倉鎭，縣城即可收復。東路部隊昨晚已迪近遵化東三十華里地方。據悉遵化平谷山地，經共軍之改造，已成爲險要之戰略地，山地多炸成山洞，預料該地帶可能演出一大會戰。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕錦州古北口綫，因承德南下國軍之克復古北口時，已全綫打通，錦州鐵路局已派人出發勘察，準備修復工作，平古段雖未打通，但平沽區鐵路局已準備工料，定十五日開始測勘工作。據路局人談，該段雖爲輕軌，亦係標準軌距，將來不致影響與其他鐵路聯運。又共軍爲阻止國軍補給，今晨一時將平古綫張辛順義間之橋樑，以地雷炸毀二處。</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏十日電〕國軍於十日午後收復集寗城郊狼虎山。定軍山等據點，一部突入城內。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕此間關係機關訊，大同情勢繼續好轉，繼城北據點之收復，東西南三面所失之據點，亦已收復三分之二。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原十一日電〕大同西南周家店（距城五華里）共軍，十日晚砲擊西關，落彈十餘發，另部犯南關，激戰二小時，同晚共軍由城東聚樂堡（距城六十華里）西開汽車十餘輛，繼續補給彈藥，刻瓦窰村（城西南一華里半）雙方坑道工事，相距五十餘公尺對峙。</p>

<p>傳共軍撤離哈市司令部移佳木斯</p>
<p>〔本報北平十一日電〕東北大致平靜，僅本溪一帶有衝突，惟此一沉寂，熱難永久平靜，官方推斷，林彪將發動進攻，以牽制國軍向西移動。共方亦宣傳國軍正在部署進攻，稱新六軍已南調遼陽鞍山海城一帶，有所行動，七十一軍正集結遼源法庫一帶，準備掃蕩西滿，新一軍集結於長春永吉及松花江南岸一帶，積極進行修復松花江鐵橋，準備北取哈爾濱。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十一日電〕據此間今日發表之急電稱：共軍已開始自哈爾濱總退却。據華北日報及北平日報同時載稱：過去數月中在哈爾濱指揮軍事之東北共軍總司令林彪，已開始將其司令部移往哈爾濱東北二百哩西伯利亞邊界西南七十五哩之佳木斯。又據稱，自哈埠退出之共軍，亦向該處移動，同時共軍正以大量食糧運往該地。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕中宣部外記者招待會，十一日午後三時牛舉行，由彭部長學沛，劉次長鍇主持，茲錄主要問題如下：問，如非正式五人小組關於國府委員會之名額分配得有協議，政府是否可以：（一）發布全國停戰令，（二）抑或政府仍堅持中共必須退出蘇北？</p>
<p>彭部長答，不久以前，政府要求中共撤退蘇北，膠濟路等地，彼時中共即要求先改組政府，現在政府同意商談改組國府委員會，中共又請先取銷上述各條件，政府不願墜入此循環矛盾之中，僅由政府下令，恐難獲五人所期望之效果。例如政府歷次下令，未能解大同之　，如中共眞掬誠悃與政府合作，余信衝突即可停止，蓋政府不主張以武力解決中共問題，政府之所切盼者，厥爲恢復安寗與秩序，俾得及早清于於國家之建設。建設一經開始，則中共所控制之飢餓羣衆，將獲得職業，而返回其正常之生活，彼等如喪失其擾亂之工具，則成爲和平之公民，其中一部份，仍然信仰馬克思主義抑或極權主義，並無妨碍，蓋此等思想，早於廿五個世紀以前，散見於周秦諸子之中，中國無人畏懼此等古舊學說。問，目前軍事情况如何？</p>
<p>彭部長答，蘇北如皐方面無變化，宿遷方而國軍，進人運河以東，大同仍在國軍手中，傳作義援軍已抵豐鎭，古北口已克復，平古鐵路不久可通車。</p>

<h3 id="c5">共方武裝監視之下　迫令小組離承德　美方組長報告撤離經過 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平十一日電〕軍調部第十一執行小組組長美方羅茲邁上校今日對新聞記者宣稱：共軍逮捕第十一小組，迫令離承德，在武裝監視之下，循熱河省之曲折道路而行，途中遭國軍飛機掃射。共軍一軍官勒令小組離承德時，「余聲明乃在抗議之下啓程，且余認爲本人已遭逮，皆因面臨武力，祗得啓程，更因在武裝監視之下，方始成行」。羅氏之報吿，與前傳第十一小組經過情形，完全不同。羅氏又披露，空襲時喪生之共方四人並非小組人員，中共消息，前傳四人係小組人員，並非實情。此四人爲共軍卡車司機與火伕各一，及士兵兩名。小組人員喪生者，僅國軍軍曹李淸富一人。羅氏又詳述小組人員美軍曹霍根被灼傷後，渠試圖求取援救，均遭共軍阻撓。渠向共軍聲明曾奉軍調部命令留駐承德，但尙未及電吿軍調部，共軍即迫令隨同撤退，且「共軍武裝士兵令余停閉無綫電」。時國軍距承德四十哩，渠並向當地共軍司令提出書面抗議，反對勒令小組撤退。又小組國府方面人員閔時濟上校向新聞記者稱：「全在武裝壓迫之下離城，共軍武裝人員至小組辦事處强迫吾人啓程，余乃吿共軍須發逮捕狀，余始離城，共軍竟稱，「好，我們逮捕你」。小組共方人員王笑天上校，亦曾見新聞記者，謂羅。閔兩氏之言「大錯」，羅氏確曾抗議，但共軍要求小組離城，乃爲小組本身安全着想。一軍撤退，一軍進駐之過渡期間，城中竊小必然造成混亂，共軍深以小組安全爲慮云。羅氏復叙述小組人員從承德北撤至察熱邊境多倫，沿途備受艱苦，又表示國軍飛機兩架，掃射小組人員時，無法吿知其掃射目標爲執行小組。羅氏繼稱：小組人員乘共電卡車一輛，上載汽油四筒，及手溜彈等，至圍塲南面十三哩處P51型飛機越山峯而來，立即向卡車猛撲，車中人除司機及伙夫一人外，立即躍下，卡車被機關槍彈擊中爆炸，時飛機離地面僅六百呎，斜飛以免炸及。小組旣抵多倫，共軍態度完全改變，供給卡車，於本月十日送小組抵張家口。</p>

<p>〔合眾社南京十一日電〕共產黨發言人王炳南十一日稱：蔣主席已拒絕給予停戰保證，但已提出一共產黨所不能接受之反建議。蔣主席之意見，係於十一日由馬歇爾將軍轉達周恩來氏。馬周兩氏十一日曾作長談，然司徒大使未出席，事後亦未的定下次舉行會商之日期。王氏謂：局勢依然嚴重，共產黨是否拒不參加五人小組會談，目下尙未決定。按共產黨前曾宣稱：蔣主席如不發出停戰命令，彼等將不參加五人小組。當詢以共產黨是否準備有所讓步，以挽回局勢時，王氏答以「吾」字。至於蔣主席所提反建議之內容如何，王氏認爲「目下尙非披露之時」。但據其他方面吿合衆社記者云：蔣主席之建議包括兩點：（一）關於停戰保證：此項保證實無需要，因政府並未發出任何攻擊令，苟共黨停止進攻政府軍，則停戰爲勢所必然之結果。（二）關於共產軍撤退地區之五項要求：此事可交改組後之國府委員會解決之。當詢以在今日之曾議中，馬歇爾將軍曾吾提出妥協計劃時，王氏宣稱：「關於戰爭問題，無妥協可言」。渠並云：周恩來有處理和平談判之全權，彼所提出之停戰保證要求，延安最高當局完全予以支持。</p>

<p>〔聯合社本埠訊〕運輸問題爲中國復典一大障碍。上海在戰前原爲重要之轉口商埠，進口貨由此運往內地，今日之上海，美貨擁塞，和平一年之後，此項貨物運入內地及華北各大城市者仍微乎其微。海空及鐵路設備雖在發展中，亦無濟於事。內地運輸之停頓，固由於中共之破壞鐵路綫，但海空兩路則無所妨碍，而水運允可爲主要運輸綫；戰前內港運輸，大部份由中英日三國輪船擔任，日人現已打倒，英國及其他外國輪船，則被禁止在中國各港口載運客貨，故水道交通目前僅有中國輪船擔任。中國戰前輪船多在戰時失散或被毀，今日大部份輪船均向美國租借或購置；但此種船隻絕對不足發揮運輸能力，試觀華北各城市商店貨櫃空乏，即可知其一班。一部份進出口商，以爲自美國多得船隻以擴大運輸能力。</p>
<p>不調和的情形</p>
<p>在此交通不便情形之下，往往發現下列不調和情形：　英國輪船一艘，上月自上海開到靑島，一大部份艙位虛空，該船艙內和甲板上可容乘客二百五十人，結果僅有孤伶寂寞之旅客一人而已，該船在中國各港口不准裝運客貨，僅可裝載救濟品；次日，該船開往天津，有不速之中國乘客登船，旣無　　，又無證件，船員吿以不能載客，囑彼等上岸，但此輩置之不理，中國警察與憲兵到船査問，亦無能爲力，該船終於啓椗，免費乘客附船隨行者十人。另一方面，中國輪船一艘，亦在同一時間開到靑島，其載客容量爲二百五十人，竟載客至九百人。據乘客談：船上情形非常困難，不合世界海運標準，乘客少有獲得艙位之機會，百分之九十均露宿甲板，下雨則以汕布遮身，其婦人携兩孩赴華北，自帶食物和行軍床，亦宿於甲板，船上所設餐室，價格之高，勝過上海黑市。據該婦人稱：吾等待遇殆如苦力，故歸途由空路返滬。</p>
<p>陸空運的麻煩</p>
<p>空運本身固有效及準時，惟美國C-46C-47及C-54各式飛機，被改裝成客機後，僅一部份乘客獲得優先權，普通乘客仍須於數星期前預先定座，行李艙位有限，而官塲手續累贅，塡表格，覓保證，及警局許可證等，不勝其煩，鐵路設備，除京滬路上少數美國製之流綫型火車外，旅客常感有脫班之苦，因此每不能趕上行李軍，且各　火車擁擠，坐位狹窄。故目下最易補救亦最易收益者、厥爲船運。天津某商人在其富麗之新寫字間中招待記者，該寫字間一切裝瑛，應有盡有，只缺貨物。據其分析整個問題稱：「此乃一個簡單的數學問題，如加上少數外國輪船，加上一些效力，再减少若干限制，再减少一套官樣文章，於事已足」云。</p>

<p>— 本報資料室特輯</p>
<p>吳經熊時常被稱爲是中國法律界的天才。二十六歲上便成了東吳大學法學院的名敎授，所著的「法理學」一書在美國的許多大學裏都被採用做敎本；二十八歲上便成了上海剛收回的臨時法院中最年輕，但也最露頭角的推事。他是立法院中數一數二的專家，也是中華民國第一部憲法「五五憲法草案」的起草人。</p>
<p>一副玳瑁邊的眼鏡，後面藏着一雙學者型底深沉的眸子，嘴唇常常是緊閉着，顯示出他的意志與智慧·這位今年還不到五十歲的法學家，最近被任命爲我國駐敎廷公使。自從不久前田耕莘氏被敎皇升任爲樞機主敎以後，敎庭和中國的關係，已經日臻密切，但是敎會和國家間的關係，不單是外交的，而且是宗敎的，文化的。要選擇這樣一位使節，吳經熊自然是最適當的人物了。</p>
<p>他有着一段光輝的早年歷史。二十二歲時在當時極負盛名的東吳大學法科以甲等榮譽畢業，二十三歲上得美國密歇根大學的法學博士學位，因爲成績的優異，被送到法國，在巴黎大學研究，第二年，又去德國柏林大學硏究，二十六歲上便成了東吳法學院的名敎授。</p>
<p>那時，丁文江和徐維震正辦理收回臨時法院，吳氏在雜誌上發表論文，提出關於臨時法院的意見，徐氏讀到了，大爲欽佩，便發表了委他爲民庭的推事之一。徐氏那時是臨時法院的院長，但他們兩個人素不相識，到成立之日，吳走馬上任，去見院長，兩個人見了還先要請敎尊姓大名，弄得大家都笑了起來。</p>
<p>吳氏後來　次升任到臨時法院的院長，民國十八年，他應哈佛大學之聘，去美國講學，這位三十一歲的年輕院長，看上去還只像個剛出校門的小伙子，他出國前自已去大來輪船公司訂艙位，在姓名欄下簽了John　C.　H.　wu，輪船公司的外國人看了這個名字，向他全身打量了一邁，問他說：那末你就是臨時法院吳院長的公子，到美國去讀書的嗎？</p>
<p>廿二年，吳氏應孫科院長之邀，担任立法委員，自此以後，即一直參加　國家的立法工作，而他最大的貢獻，自然就是「五五憲草」的起稿。這部憲法是根據中山先生五權分立的精神，並參照歐美各國憲法的特長而擬成的，在政治協商會議中曾提出若干修正，但無疑的這仍是中國惟一的一部憲法藍本。吳氏於英文極有造詣，戰前在上海辦過英文的大型刋物「天下」，在某期中他寫了一篇文章，將唐詩巾的境地和英國十九世紀的詩相比擬，其文筆的淸麗，使人人都看出他是一位於英國文學極有修　的人。</p>
<p>不久前，在重慶聽人說起，吳氏曾應蔣主席之囑，參考英，法，拉丁三種文字，迻譯聖經，一九四二年十一月一日開始執筆，已于一九四四年十月卅一日脫稿，就中新約二十七卷與聖詠一卷，均經，主席親自詳加校閱修正，「聖詠譯義」月內即將由商務印書館出版，這實在是以中國文言文字迻譯經典之始，對文化和宗敎上都是個不朽的貢獻。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3 id="c47">市參議會今後將如何？ <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>上海市首届參議會第一次會議，到昨天爲止，已經過了三天，開了六次大會，在報紙上雖像很熱閙，然大體仍在報吿和質詢的階段，尙未議到眞正有關市民福利和負担的議案。三四百萬市民對於參議會今後的動向如何，眞可謂「萬目睽睽」，豈止十目所視，十手所指？參議員諸君，競選時非常踴躍，開會時應該想到當時爲什麼要競選。參議會第一次會議，如果不能義出幾件萬衆屬望的議案來，將何以對市民？</p>
<p>就一般記者三天來的觀感說，參議會的議塲，到昨天始漸感覺有「議會」空氣。以前兩天，似乎太客氣了一些，太肅穆了一些。我們並不暗示議塲裏必須飛墨匣，拍桌子，但議塲也究竟不祗是大家慶賀恭維互道寒暄的地方。像昨天那樣質詢與答覆的緊張，贊成與反對的辨難，纔可看出民主政治的風度與精神將在這些塲面中培養成功的根苗。我們早就指出：市參議會此次最大任務，就在上海這個國際大都市裘，樹立起中國地方議會的一個模範。市參議會要做到這一點，必須一切不怕「公開」，不怕「辯論」，要尋求眞理而切勿　越規章，要不抹煞少數意見而仍須服從多數的決議，要在會塲裏可以辨駁得面紅耳赤，而散會後拉手笑談若無其事。必如此，纔像一個議會，也必如此，纔能使中國躋於民主國家之林。假使參議員也如有些高唱民主的人一般，一旦自己的意見不獲通過，就拂袖退席，那永遠不會看見民主的。</p>
<p>其次，「不出代議士不納稅」，本是英國民主憲政最早的金科玉律，故市參議會最重大的責任，莫過於通過市預算與審核市決算。我們以爲市參議會與其議決幾百件鷄零狗碎的裝飾議案，不如精細地覈實地，根據今後市政設施的方針，切切實實通過一個合理的預算案。預算案不獨可以看出市財政的收支既况，實在可以作爲市政府一切施政的準繩。預算案裏規定的事纔可辦；它所删除的就不當辦。而決算案及以往的收支槪算，則更可看出市政府爲市民辦事，其收入是否合法？其支出是否糜費？要知市政府的一文支出，都是市民的一滴脂膏。一滴汗血。市政府今年下半年度的總預算草案，現已提交市參議會了；這是惟一的大案。據說明，收支不敷，須另列新增捐稅三百三十三億二千七百十五萬餘元，方可應付支出。我們還不知道市政府將新增什麼捐稅？也不知道這些捐稅的性質，還是由每一市民平均負担，還是重課那些發國難財勝利財和接收財的富者？尤其不知道新增捐稅以後將用之於辦些什麼有利於市民的市政？因此，我們此時只能保留批評；但參議會在審査討論這一大案時，應該明瞭它責任的重大。市政府的施政方針與工作計劃，己經明白了嗎？曾經市參議會先通過了這方針與計劃嗎？過去的收支概况和用途決算，已經審核過了嗎？以前有兩個租界時代的工部局公董局的預算決算和戰前市政府的預算決算，參議會有材料可供參考嗎？一般市民所急切期望市政府趕辦的市政是那些事情，參議員諸君已經廣泛徵詢渦意見嗎？凡此，都是討論預算案的重大關鍵所在。參議會中儘多社會賢達，會計專家，和來自民間的代表，諒能不負數百萬市民的期望。</p>
<p>我國與敎廷關係的新頁</p>
<p>行政院前日七五八次會議，通過任命吳經熊氏爲駐敎廷公使，這是我國與敎廷外交關係的新頁。査我國與敎廷建立外交關係，正値珍珠港事變起後，國際風雲緊急之會，實爲我戰時外交之一大成就。我政府於民國三十一年春，任命謝壽康氏爲我首任駐敎廷公使，謝氏於到任後，對促進我國與敎廷關係，建樹甚多，卒在其任內有首任國籍樞機之任命，在華敎會體制之建立。當時因戰時關係，敎廷迄未能派遣外交使節來華；如今敎廷有首任駐華公使之任命，而我國亦於此際以常代法學櫂威出使敎廷。至是，我國與敎廷纔有正常外交關係的建立·吳氏身爲天主敎敎友，又爲聞名國際之法學者，以之出任斯職·必能勝任愉快，自不待言。</p>
<p>敎廷梵蒂岡以彈丸之地，而各國使節畢集；即在美國，亦有杜魯門總統個人代表泰勒大使，駐在其地。蓋以敎宗爲世界最高道德權威，全世界四萬萬天主敎信衆精神信愛之所寄，凡有言行，在在足以影饗世界大局。方今世界値大戰之後，戰後秩序之重建，端在持久和平之確保。敎宗以最高道德權威，對於世界和平的重建，在在可以發生直接的或間接的影響。我政府以我國第一流學者出使敎廷，可見政府對於我國與敎廷的關係如何重視。</p>
<p>天主敎自明季再傳入中土後，對於促進中西文化之交流，厥功甚偉；降及近世，信衆逾四百萬，敎士遍全國，雖在全人口中所占的百份比並不高，但究不失爲一股重要力量。其所奉敎義，兼包儒道，要與修身齊家之旨，甚爲接近，而它的處世精神崇尙堅毅樸實，與我主席所倡導的「踐履篤實」，若合符節。今國家當建國之會，而建國之首要，端在道德秩序之確立，此我主席會不殫辭費，再四言之。我政府對我國與敎廷關係旣極重視，深望全國天主敎信衆能仰體政府的一番至意，將天主敎義的精神身體力行，爲全國樹立一種新風氣。要挽回目前「人慾橫流」的不道德的頽風，我們需要天主敎精神的貫注。國家民族之有望於天主敎信衆者至殷。願天主敎信衆好自爲之！</p>
<p>泛亞洲會議</p>
<p>報載法國新聞社新德里電訊，謂印度臨時政府內閣總理尼赫魯，將邀請亞洲各國，於來年在印度舉行泛亞洲會議云云。此一消息之傳來，頗爲突兀。目前旣未得官方的證實，對於在印召開泛亞洲會議一節，我們不願有所論列。不過泛亞洲會議這一名稱，旣被提出，我們亦願於此表示一些意見。</p>
<p>從原則上講，倘若這種具有區域性的泛亞洲會議，取法乎泛美會議，而與聯合國的機構不相抵觸，是則對於安全秩序的維繫，可能有極大的貢獻，我們自然可以贊同的。不過泛美會議的召開，原有歷史及其它關係存乎其間；亞洲美洲的情形，似乎未能視同一例。倘若要循泛美的舊規，則發起主持之間，似乎頗費商量。再則所謂泛亞洲會議，也可能取法所謂泛阿刺伯的一種姿態，或則是以一種人民的會議，而沒有政府代表的參加。</p>
<p>但無論採取那種形式，從實際政治的觀點，此際而有所謂泛亞洲會議的召開，是否爲一種明智的舉措，不無疑問。就現有的跡象來看，此時而有此項泛亞洲會議的召開，時機實尙未成熟。亞洲的大部人民，剛從日本軍閥所倡導的「大東亞共榮圈」解放出來，他們在精神上肉體上，都會受了蒙有毒素的「泛亞」主義所賜之很深的苦難。此雖爲日本式的「泛亞」主義，但「泛亞」的論調，旣被日本軍閥蹧蹋了一個時候我們必須先做一番凈化功夫。吾則若漫不經意的重彈舊調，徒然引起人民慘痛的回憶。再則目今國際局勢如此，此項泛亞會議的召開，很可能作爲一種「祭品」而被犧牲。站在中國人民的立塲，在此際而有泛亞會議的召開，覺得尙待斟酌。所以我們相信像這樣一位聰明而具有才幹的人物如尼赫魯的，對這個比較重大的問題，似乎還應有所考慮。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十日電〕據消息靈通人士談稱；杜魯門總統昨夜在白宮與海軍部長福萊斯特，陸軍參謀總長艾森豪威爾，及海軍參謀總長尼米資舉行會議，此乃美國陸海空軍統一指揮之豫兆。聞總統擬規定一種公式，以便消滅各部門司令官　之　擦。關於此事，總統將簽署法令兩道，第一道規定設立統一國防委員會，由總統任主席。第二道規定設立　　委員會，保衛全國可供作戰之重要資源及原料之出產。該一委會當確保全國之戰爭能力，擴充至最大限度。依照第一道命令規定，在陸海空軍完全統一指揮之前，每一部門最高司令當保持相當之獨立性，至於全國資源委員會當負責實施最近總統關於資源存儲十年計劃之命令。該項計劃規定於今後十年內，以四十萬萬美元之代價，向世界市　購進美國　前所缺乏之電要國防原料。同時，英國參謀總長蒙哥馬利即將自加拿大來美訪問，美國統一指揮之決定，對於英國軍專機　自將發生影響。</p>

<p>美國具有決心擊破蘇聯陣綫</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕美國務院前嘗決心擊破蘇聯陣綫，以下即爲其中原因之一部，吾人由此可以窺見美蘇糾紛之癥結所在：（一）大西洋憲章已獲蘇聯承認，其中並未規定以領土給于任何國家，但蘇聯曾自芬蘭取得加洛連土腰，自羅馬尼亞取得貝薩拉比亞及北巴古維亞，此外並略取波蘭以東之地，且自捷克取得路眞尼亞。彼蘭及捷克雖同爲聯合國家，蘇聯亦未嘗顧及。三强除蘇聯外，英美兩國皆未略取他國土地。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日電〕最近歐洲及其他各處局勢之發展，已使華盛頓各界增加關於戰爭之談話資料，且無日不有一部份專攔作家提出「第二次珍珠港事變一或「鉗形攻勢」將加於阿拉斯加之警吿。但據美國婦女領袖之意見，一切關於戰爭之風傳，實爲互相猜忌及恐懼之自然結果。據最近自蘇聯歸來之婦女俱樂部聯盟主席狄鏗生女士稱。蘇聯人士承認祗有對美國人民之友誼與善意，始能避免戰爭，狄鏗生女士雖絕不喜愛蘇聯之生活方式，但渠認爲美蘇二國間實無不可友好相處之理由。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕猶太協會駐美代表古爾特曼今日談稱，猶太協會，未曾參加倫敦會議之首次會議，乃一原則問題，並非一種手段，本人在巴黎晤貝文外相時，曾請其與猶阿兩族作私人談判，以爲倫敦會議之準備，但爲貝文所拒。猶太協會認爲願意討論分治計劃，已爲我方之一大讓步。阿拉伯代表並未作讓步，但携有不妥協之方案出席會議。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第五次及第六次會議，於昨日上下午分別舉行。上午九時一刻開會，到議鉑一百五十人，列席人員十人。迄昨日爲止，秘書處收到提案共三百五十二件，市長交議案五件。上午由地政局長祝平報吿施政概况，繼由議長提出詢問辦法，除書面外，口頭質詢先寫條交主席，依次在發言席報號詢問，並以一般性爲重。議員八人即向祝局長提出質詢，中以陶百川所提地政局高級職員凟職貪污案，造成空氣最爲緊張。大會旋又再度討論委派代表參加淸査團問題，雖意見紛紜，討論熱烈，結果仍議決俟該團團長張知本返滬後再行決定。</p>

<h3 id="c72">祝平報吿地政　土地登記八萬餘件　籲請實行土地政策 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>地政局長祝平報吿本市土地行政工作，特別强調地政工作與地方自治之關係，一再引用總理遣敎條文。渠稱：關於地政工作，一方面係政治性，因立國要素，即爲土地，人民，主權。另一方面又爲經濟性，蓋土地，勞力，資本三項，爲生產所不可或缺者，故地政工作，極爲繁瑣。</p>
<p>地政工作與地方自治工作，關係密切。「自治必自地政始。」建國大綱中載：實施地政，必辦地價稅。地方自治經濟力，可仰頓地政方面收入。現關於土地稅及淸査土地，皆在積極進行中。將米可供自治經費之用。目前之中心工作，爲土地整理，土地登記，土地淸算，估定地價，實行地價稅等。茲將三月來之工作，略加報吿如下：</p>
<p>土地登記此事頗繁，處理原則分四點：一·簡化手續。二·縮短時間。三·减輕收費。四·嚴厲懲辦藉端勒索。以上各點，皆完成若干。例如道契，可供流通金融之用。但登記審查，必須交騐道契。但交付地政局，妨礙週轉，故多數地主皆不願登記。爲輕减困難起見，乃改採照片制。交騐道契時，原始證件外，附交照片二張。原證先發還，照片留存。關於移轉登記，只要辦好新登記，可於一天之內完成。登記費亦已停收，但土地登記，手續委實太繁，事情亦太複雜。過去法租界，自一九一〇年起，即辦理土地登記，直至戰前尙未完成。舊公共租界費時更久。上海市政府，自民國十六年至二十六年，所辦之土地登記，亦不過十六萬餘件。至三月來已申請之土地，有八萬餘件，已辦理完竣者有五百餘件。</p>
<p>道契問題租界時代，外人購地，付予道契，但若干道契，戶名雖爲外人，產權早歸國人所有，且過去國人購地，亦多化外人之名。勝利後，整理道契，外人稱戶名即係外人，應歸外人。此事影響我國主權極大。經吳市長多次折衝，始獲解決。凡　　　　國人者，產權即歸國人。</p>
<p>公地淸理本市公地甚亂，因租界及偽組織時代，變化極多，現所有公地之擋案卷宗皆已收集完備，目前問題係如何淸理，如何接收。關於敵僞徵用民地，理應發還，但甚困難。因一部份已供國防用，如機塲等。農田本應早發還，但亦有困難。因一部份係中央接收者。關於省市劃界問題，本市疆界民國十六年已由中央決定。現因蘇政府未同意，尙未完全接收，須中央派員商定。關於地價稅，正積極準備，中央令今年必行。</p>
<p>房荒問題有二原則：一，處理現狀，加强租賃管理。二，獎勵建築·新造房屋，免二年地價稅，一年房捐，房租不限制。</p>
<p>最後報吿土地政　華萊斯來華考察後，認爲中國工業化先決條件，即爲實行土地改革，必須耕者有其田·司徒雷登亦稱：要求中國之和平統一，必實行土地改革。其實，此言總理於數十年前已說過而現届迫切非做不可之階段，上海雖爲工商之區，然亦有百餘萬畝農地，上海爲全國經濟文化中心，要實行國家最重要之設施，仍須自上海做起，祇要各賢明參政員有決心，對此如有決策，則在行政技術上我們有辦法，任何困難，皆在所不計。</p>

<p>關於市參議會應不應該派員參加淸査團的問題前天下午，引起了一番精彩的辯論，昨日上午，地政局長答覆質詢完畢以後。潘議長就宣佈繼續討論這一個問題。各參議員發言踴躍，緊張熱烈。有人主張參加，有人反對參加，有人主張有條件的參加，有人主張另組接收調査團，也有人主張先請淸査團到大會來報吿，再決定態度。但最後却通過暫將此案保留，由議長電請張團長知本在三天內回上海，問明一切後，再加討論。</p>
<p>在討論正題之前，秘書長報吿向淸査團詢問兩點的結果：一，淸査團上海工作的時間共計五十天，從七月二十四日到九月十三日，延長淸査時間，恐怕辦不到。二，參議會派員參加，僅是協助性質，同時人數不能增加·</p>
<p>報吿完了以後，馮有眞登台發言。他說：「對於這個問題，需要冷靜考慮，關於參議會自組淸査團，恐怕欠妥，因爲參議會是立法機構，並不是監察機關，事實上不能單獨執行淸查接收物資，因爲不在職權範圍內。說到拒絕參加，或不免愧對上海市四百多萬市民市參會本來是代表四百多萬市民的，而市民所最不滿意的就是接收工作，所以市參會一有機會，就應該淸査，做一天就是盡了一天責任。否則，市民們要說參議會放棄責任。但參加以後，是去主動的淸査，由參議會公吿市民，請市民協助檢舉。其次，參加以後，仍舊保特獨立的身份。而且應該派三個代表，一個是律師，一個是會計師，還有一個是新聞界的。」馮並推舉詹文滸爲新聞界的代表。</p>
<p>之後，由馬君碩發表意見「淸査團是中央組織的，地方團體不能够加以變更，而旦九月十三日就要結束。所以我們另外組織一個上海區接收委員會，私人民聯絡，實行長期澈底調査。這個委員會是義務性質的，設主任委員一人，委員十一人，從這裏面再推選一個人，參加淸査團，成爲人民和淸査團之間的橋樑」·這時，潘議長發表聲明說：「現在所討論的，是應該不應該參加的問題。至於組織調査委員會，是另外一個問題，暫時不討論」。</p>
<p>其他發言贊成參加的，有王劍鍔。他說：「因爲政府對派出的大員不信任，所以組織淸查團。我們應該參加，並且監督淸查團。不過，在參加之外，還應另設組織」。朱泰耀也是贊成參加的，他說：「參加的步驟應該考慮，先要明瞭淸査團過去的工作，同時必須延長淸査的時間」。</p>
<p>黃振世說：「淸查團旣然來信邀請，參加不參加都由大會決定。倫陷區接收的物資以上海爲最多，所接收的都是民脂民膏，淸查團在上海方面有何成績，應該到大會來報吿。」</p>
<p>路式導是反對參加的，他說：「我們不能去做裝飾品，參加等於白費，根本不會有結果，而且事實上，淸查團十三日就結束，離現在僅有四十八小時，在這四十八小時中，能淸査出甚麼？市民們對於接收舞弊是深惡痛絕的，他們希望有一個淸淸楚楚的結果，所以我們要另外組織一個淸査的機構。」</p>
<p>首先表示反對，發表爆炸性意見的陶百川說：「我個人並沒有參加敵僞產業處理局的工作，所以我反對參加，並不是爲了個人的方便。但，在座有參加處理局工作的參議員，討論這個問題時，應該諱避。此外，淸査團八月十一日正式開始淸査工作，在八月十三日本會正式成立時就應該通知我們，現在他們已經去杭，工作就要結束，才來通知我們，似乎根本就沒有誠意。我們自組淸査團，雖然沒有法律的根據，但別人也沒有反對我們組織的法律根據。」</p>
<p>這時陸蔭初動議停止討論，無異議通過。但在表決以前，張志韓提議說：「不妨暫將本案保留，由議長電請張團長知本在三天內回上海，問明一切之後，再付表決。因爲現在還不知道，淸査團是不是一定在四十八小時後結束。」</p>
<p>表決結果，以一百票通過。</p>
<p>據某參議員預測：將來贊成參加的，也許會佔多數。到底如何，我們且等着瞧吧！</p>

<p>下午於三時一刻宣吿開會，秘書長報吿出席人數及上午會議簡情後，即由財政局長谷春帆氏開始報吿。谷氏演詞分收支情形及徵收制度兩方面論述：</p>
<p>（一）收支情形：上半年全市地方收入爲一四五億九千餘萬元，支出爲二〇七億二千餘萬元，不敷六一億三千餘萬元，全由中央貼補抵當。一般說來，本市地方收入逐月進步，其原因一爲物價增漲之結果，一爲整頓稽征之結果，因物價上漲稅收自亦旺盛，但物價半年來僅增加二倍餘，而稅收則增達六借餘，凈增之數全係整頓稽征之效。六月份收支且已達到平衡之程度，但因月底公務員待遇調整，在七月份內支出，致又不敷。七八兩月經努力設法，八月份又近平衡，但因公務員待遇再度調整，九月份起仍難彌補。中央公敎人員待遇之一再調整，對於久經艱苦之人員雖屬稍有補益，而於政府財政上之支出，殊屬莫大之負擔。</p>
<p>（二）徵收制度：一，房捐，南市閘北浦東舊越界築路等區房捐底册，去年接收時已散佚不全，須從新普査，現已在籌備進行中。房捐征收手續現已减省，使納捐人可隨地繳納，不必指定地域。夏季房捐已於七月間征收，並帶征保衛團服裝費及防疫經費，均以一季爲限。二，娛樂稅自八月一日起减爲百分之四十，筵席稅實行官製帳單及堂簿蓋印辦法，先由商店自動報繳，倘有不實再行抽査及實行坐征。三，田賦中央原定征實，本市因困難較多，業已呈准折征法幣。征額方面原定九斗二升，現正在請求以四折繳付以示格外體卹農民之艱苦。五，牌照稅方面，營業牌照稅因法令解釋發生爭議，計算標準亦有問題，巳一再請示財部核示。使用牌照稅，原係參照改制前車捐費率訂定，現因物價上漲，下半年度改訂五倍征收。六，屠宰稅已於七月間正式成立稽征處，統一市區及郊區之征收。</p>
<p>谷氏論及財政前途稱，健全之財政一方面基於健全之制度，一方而基於健全之預算。</p>
<p>目前最大缺點在於始終未建立健全之財政制度，稅收分配尙在不合理之狀態。因收入來源百分之七十以上係得自筵席捐及娛樂捐，但此種稅收係屬行爲取締稅，所謂「寓禁於征」，執行愈有效，收入愈减少，且徵收困難，費用較大，更有季節性之旺淡，頓以應付長期計劃之市政建設極不相宜。揆諸以前租界時代，收入中百分之四十係房捐，百分之三十係地捐，百分之十以上係執照捐，再以美國市稅收入而論，房地捐更佔百分之九十二以上，故房捐實係最合理之普遍公允之稅源。現本市房捐收入，上半年僅佔百分之四，七八月份因他種稅收增加，更减至百分之二，地捐開徵則尙在積極籌備時期，執照捐如人力車每輛僅收二千元，總數所佔百分比更爲微少，此種不合理之現象必須加以改革。</p>
<p>此次擬具之下半年展預算總數八百四十七億元，粗視之下數字似頗驚人，然設以五千倍折算，僅合戰前一千六百餘萬元，而民國廿五年本市三行政機構之預算總數爲四千七百餘萬元，故比較之下，實不能算高，問題僅在市民有無負担之力量。現人口數量較戰前超出一倍以上，雖經濟力已大爲降低，但祇要每人負担戰前負祖數之百分之三十六，即可達到預算之目標矣。至於如何另闢稅源，此次已提出提案四種，如僅以使市府工作維持現狀即爲滿足，則欲達到收支平衡每月亦須增加三十五億元，如更進一步希望市府能有所建設，將上海眞正辦好，則每月須增加六十億元。總之，希望參議會能祥細檢討，以求得合理之結果。此外，如增强辦事效率方面，本人向來奉公守法，以身作則，如部下或有不法行爲，希望隨時具名檢舉云。</p>
<h3 id="c79">財政局長答覆質詢 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>向財政局長提出口頭質詢的有季灝龔夏陶百川李文杰等九人，主要的內容和谷局長的答覆歸納如下：</p>
<p>（一）間：筵席捐偸漏之情形如何改善？答：坦白說很難稽査，最好的辦法希望市民上館子後一定要向酒菜館取得發票。一方面於發現偸漏情形時嚴厲處罰，偸漏一次處罰一天的營業總額。再或者用派人坐査的辦法，以兩天至三天的營菜額計算一月的納稅額</p>
<p>（二）問：房捐徵收的標準如何？似有過高而鼓勵房東加租之嫌？答：房捐現在沿用工部局時候的標準加倍徵收。工部局對於徵收房租的標準根據各種因素調査得非常詳細，至於房捐超過租金，則因現用固定租金的辦法，不致於有影響。</p>
<p>（三）問：筵席捐的起徵點實嫌過低，財政局是否可以提高？答：現在已有幾十家平民食堂免徵筵席捐，此外規定客飯不收稅。客飯價格原定一千三百元，現擬提高至一千四百四十元，酒菜業方面則要求增爲一千六百元，現尙在考慮中。</p>
<p>（四）問：保　目頸口的收支　形如何？答：收入臘數共三億餘元，已支出二億七千餘元，　　暫由本局保存·</p>
<p>此外陶百川的質問是近於建議性質的，他認爲市府下半年度預算的審査將是參議會最重要工作之一，必須愼重嚴密。他主張先由全體參議員作一個原則上的審査，再交由小組會詳細研究。李文杰附和他的意見，並且希望市政府將下半年度的施政方針和工作計劃詳細報吿。谷局長認爲這兩項建議很有價値，並表示如果大會實行原則上的審査時，他願意出席旁聽來加以解釋和補充。</p>
<p>連日質詢最激熱之陶百川</p>
<h3 id="c80">恢復賽馬問題　議員大多反對 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市市府當局爲彌補財政收入，曾由市長向市參議會提出交議案，擬開放本市南京中路跑馬廳，恢復賽馬，以增稅收。在此案尙未正式提交大會討論前，各議員已紛紛表示異議，據記者向若干議員詢問結果，意見各有不同，但據某議員稱：全體議員中的十之八九對此點表示反對</p>
<p>反對跑馬之趙棣華·趙君豪·周斐成·陸惠民·張中原等議員，所提理由大致相同，謂跑馬有　長賭博之風氣，如跑馬能舉行，則其他類似賭博活動，均可隨之風行。馮有眞趙君豪建議跑馬廳改爲上海文化城，其中包括三部份：（一）參議會會址（因係最高民意機關，（二）文化團體如敎育會，記者公會，美術協會，圖書館，博物館，革命史料陳列館等，（三）闢跑馬塲爲羅斯福運動塲。聞馮趙二議員將有正式提案送請大會討論，並擬具收回辦法·</p>
<p>仝道雲之意見，將跑馬廳改爲體育館，使滬市有廣大集合之地。同時靜安寺路可直貫馬霍路，開闢此路後，亦可多一條馬路，交通困難當能解決一部份。金鴻翔認爲跑馬對於生產事業毫無關係，在此工商業急待發展時，似可不必舉辦。沈鼎說：本市稅收全賴筵席娛樂兩稅，吳市長谷局長亦認爲不健全，而須有以改善，如藉跑馬可增加稅收，則此稅是否即健全之稅，値得考慮。史致富稱：跑馬不但類似賭博，其內幕主持人馬主及騎馬師等聞在若十情形下難免有相當聯絡，如發售馬票，開彩等不無壟斷現象。其次上海已成爲我國最大都市，在此繁盛區域內跑馬，與環境頗有不宜，但其中若干建築亦有保存之價値。馬君碩表示跑馬廳應收回作參議會會址，在此工商業衰落期間，不宜舉行。陶百川的意見是：對此問題須先硏究兩點：（一）木市下半年預算不足之三百億元如何籌措？（二）跑馬稅可收若干，對市政經費究有多少帮助？如不足之數不可减少，而籌措之法又是增加一般人民之負担，則不如跑馬稅收，讓富人負担。但雖如此，我仍不贊成在跑馬　，該廳應征收作爲娛樂文化活動之用，我也不贊成跑狗，因跑馬究不如跑狗之費時曠業，以賭爲常業也·</p>
<p>關於原則上贊成者：徐學禹提出兩點：（一）不反對賽馬，賽馬不能視爲賭博，應視爲一種運動，地點應在郊外，時間應在假日。（二）不贊成在跑馬廳，該廳應收圓作公共塲所·駱淸華贊成在江灣舉行，原址應改爲運動塲，或建公園。嚴諤聲謂：目前若干營業如妓院等均可存（在與繳稅，則跑馬收稅，增加收入，亦無不可·水祥雲和朱扶九的意思：上海爲國際都市，跑馬又可鍛鍊體格，如不專以賭博爲主，亦無妨舉辦，但應設在郊外。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕南京夫子廟金陵皮夾公司總經理楊立模（紹興人），副經理李鳳歧（無錫人），七月一日又創設金陵百貨公司一所，資本爲一萬萬四千萬元。並在本市漢口路曼伏大樓三十三·卅四號闢爲申莊。因規模宏大，吸收存款達三萬萬元以上。八月三十一楊李兩人因曾濫發空頭支票，無法彌補，竟携公司印章及私章等，避匿來滬。同時高級職員王如輝，陳家芬，周阿龍等亦均逃避一空·該公司股東兼襄理黃育之，乃呈報南京衛戍司令部派員馳往公司將貨物及用具搬移，一而派員會同黃來滬偵査楊李兩人踪跡。九日投報老閘分局，經刑事股長蔣上佩飭警員四出偵緝，得悉陳家芬匿居靜安寺路斜橋弄六十三號，即按址前往將陳拘獲。未幾周阿龍到來亦一併就擒，帶局嚴予盤詰。詎彼輩俱推諉不知楊李之下落。分局爲欲擒故縱計，先令陳周交保外出，並限期調査楊李匿跡所在。一面派警在斜橋弄六三號駐守。十日忽來一電話，悉楊住狄思威路一四〇四號新五味齋點心舖內·局方不動聲色，俟至次日晨三時許，派股員馮秀山率警趕往，叩後門良久，該舖堅不開啓。各警員乃潛伏弄內，觀其動靜。逾一小時後，瞥見有人在上層翻高頭岡逸，恐下面有人，躡足而下，躲於灶披間爐灶傍。警員當即上前將其緝獲，知即爲楊，楊並供出李鳳歧潘匿新閘路賡慶里十五號。續往捕獲，帶局偵訊，供認不諱。昨日擔保周阿龍之保人忽向老閘警局偽稱：周因找尋不到楊李二人，業已憤而自盡，並出示手帕一方，上用鉛筆繕就絕命書。警局據報，即派員至保人處偵査，見周阿龍仍在該處，乃復拘捕，隨將手帕一方呈案。以憑核辦。</p>

<p>祝局長報吿完畢後，即開始口頭質詢。以陶參議員百川所質詢之問題，最爲熱烈緊張。陶氏問：報載地政局高級職員有賣職貪汚行爲，且數目達數千萬元。牽涉者甚多，不知地政局曾吾澈査，其經過如何？祝局長答稱，舞弊情形確有。遠在本年四月間，地政局應浦東高橋區人民要求，發還被敵方強佔之民田，共六百餘畝。當時地政局，決定每畝收回二萬元，而主其事之鄕民代表，每畝竟收八萬元，其人本居上海，乃冒稱鄉民代表。現已移送法院，靜候法院處置。至於地政局職員是否有關，尙在偵查中。截至目前，尙無事實證據。負責科長業已撤職，交保候傳。但陶氏對以上答覆，並不滿意，繼續質詢稱：撤職者是何人？何以撤職，何故不送法院而交保？貪汚數千萬元確否？牽涉在內者尙有何人？辦理情形如何？祝局長答稱：査出後本應將主管人員送法院，因未獲實據，暫令交保。因鄉民代表係冒充者，主管人員不查，應負疏忽之責，乃將其撤職。此案法院正在偵查，倘法院認爲要辦，一定嚴辦。但參議員陸蔭初等數人，對以上補充答覆，仍不滿意，堅請祝局長發表撤職人員姓名，及舞弊數目。此時，大會氣氛至爲緊張，祝局長三次登台回答稱：撤職之地政局科長，叫張繼良，科員叫黃啓人，冒稱鄕民代表者爲周誦千。至於舞弊數目，尙在淸査巾，無從報吿，不知究收農民款額多少。此事原應法院淸査，但地政局亦積極派人偵査，一有結果，必定公佈。</p>
<p>其他口頭質詢，及祝局長之答覆，略述如下。張中原詢跑馬廳之產權何屬，業主究爲何國人？祝局長答稱：跑馬廳情形，由財政局調査，唯地政局方面亦略有所知。跑馬廳之歷史甚久，面積共計五百餘畝。跑道及其外的百餘畝，屬跑馬總會。跑道內約四百畝，屬體育會。並有一小部份私人產業及墳墓等。至於跑馬廳之產權，尙未登記，係屬道契。但政府如欲徵收，亦有權徵收，因跑馬廳僅有租權並無所有權。</p>
<p>關於重新估計地價問題，中央已有整個規定。由評議委員會決定。土地增値稅，依物價指數而定。因地價增高，實係法幣貶値結果，非地價本身增値，倘徽地價增値稅殊不合理。故在幣制尙未穩定前，暫緩徵收。除非係今日以六千萬買進，明日以七千萬賣出者，始徵地價增値稅，僞組織非法處分之土地，即使係善意購買者亦無效，此乃中央法令所規定。不過，現正向中央請示，不知能否有其他補償辦法。</p>
<p>關於敵僞產業處理局處理地產情形，與地政局方面素有聯絡，並與中央信托局會同組小組會，相互會商。房屋管理委員會係臨參會，法院，商會，市黨部，警備司令部及市府有關各局，共同參加組織。接收案件共三千六百餘件，調解成立者一千八百餘件。亦可謂有相當成績，除調解以外，並評定租金，目前正呈請核准新規則，賦予房屋管理委會以裁斷之權。至於取締頂費，雖屬旣定政策，但此係經濟問題，並非政治力量所能根本解決。關於「土地報價從價抽稅」雖係總理遺敎，唯立法院另加土地估辦法，以資補充，如何使耕者有其田，中央已在計劃起草中云·</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕工務局於昨午一時半，假市府會議室招待本市新聞界，出席工務局長趙祖康，溝渠工程處處長徐以枋，副處長兪浩鳴，總工程師顧康樂，專員錢維藩，及市府新聞處處長朱虛白，各報記者等五十餘人首由趙局報吿該局之一般工作及三大難題爲：一·防潦問題，二·平民住宅建造問題，三·銜接南北幹路問題，一二問題之主要困難在於經費之拮据，第三問題之困難基於戰前本市被分成三個勢力範圍，（前英法租界，及市府）東西交通雖極通暢，而南北交通阻塞，故按工務局計劃，本擬拓寬西藏路，浙江路，然在拆除沿路之房屋一點上，持異議者頗多，致使該項計劃未能實行。</p>
<p>積水問題久懸未決</p>
<p>趙局長報吿畢，由溝渠工程處處長徐以枋報吿目前溝路防汎之詳細情形。路謂積水問題歷來係上海之嚴重問題，前英租界當局曾經下過一番努力，然未得解決，理工務局接收後，在兩三年內，恐亦無法謀得澈底解決，經該局工程師硏討結果，認爲積潦之主要原因爲：（一）溝管口徑過小，致流通遲緩，易於淤積。（二）本市地勢過低雨水溝出口處，或無潮門，或有潮門而已損壞，致受潮水倒灌而浸溢路面。（三）雨水溝管出口處之河浜·失於疏濬，及敵僞時期滬西房屋建築缺乏管理，將浜身塡塞，阻礙雨水宣洩（四）市民不知公共衛生將拉圾倒入河浜中，致易於淤塞。</p>
<p>防潦設施對症發藥</p>
<p>工務局於明瞭積潦之病源後，即決定對症發藥之防潦設施，年來之工作集中於下列各項：（甲）淸通溝管提高排水效率。（乙）疏溶河洪以利宣洩。（丙）改建放大瓶頸溝管以暢水流。（丁）修建潮門閘壩及唧站，以防潮水倒灌，並抽洩雨水。（戊）提高特窪路面，以免雨水順路面下流而聚潴。（已）增闢溝渠出口及大量改大，以加洩水容量。上述防潦工程，均在積極進行之中。</p>
<p>西區河浜什九完成</p>
<p>現滬西區之河浜，已完成百分之九十七，僅餘打浦橋附近一段，正用挖泥機船開挖，兩旬內即可完成。又關於修建潮門閘壩及唧站之動機在於本市地勢低窪爲防止潮水倒灌溢出路面，原裝有潮門或閘門，以年久失修，漏水甚烈，全部潮門共計一百六十四座，重行改建，業已完工。閘壩唧站工程目的，在防止潮水倒灌，暴雨時並開動唧機，抽洩雨水，現在進行中者有　嘉浜日暉港口及曹家渡第一號浜進蘇州河處，唧機三座，每分鐘可抽水六萬加侖。</p>
<p>路面加高積水全無</p>
<p>又本市康定路延平路以西一段，地勢特低，經加高路面後，已無積水現象，現正進行提高路面者爲番禺路數段。上述防汎工作，經八月卅一晚之暴雨，已證明其顯有功效。該日雨量之大，據徐家匯天文台報吿：爲十五年來之第一次，而積潦程度，尙不十分嚴重，水退亦較迅速。</p>

<h3 id="c102">夏威夷華僑三萬　大多事業發達地位崇高　省議會裏也有華僑議員　檀島總領事梅景周談片 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕昨天下午，見到了新近回國的檀香山總領事梅景周先生。因爲梅先生是一向在夏威夷的，我的第一個問題，就是：「珍珠港事件發生的時候，梅先生是不是在檀香山？」</p>
<p>梅先生一面揮扇，笑着說：「珍珠港事件嗎？我差一點在這次轟炸中送了命！」他接着就吿訴我，在珍珠港事件發生之前，檀香山的上空早就天天有許多美國飛機不斷飛翔，忙於各種空戰演習。所以等到日本飛機進入上空的時候，大家都還以爲是美國飛機，連轟炸了珍珠港都大家不知道。一直到看見號外上的大標題之後，才知道日本已經動手了。檀香山市內，日機投彈很少，所以損失還算輕微，不過有一個燃燒彈却在離開中國領事館祗有三百尺的地方爆發，幸虧是落在樹林裏，因之倒並無死傷。但是日本飛機的原意，却恐怕倒是存心想炸中國領事館的，說到此地，梅先生笑起來：一因爲，他們實在恨我。我一向專門駁斥日本人那些荒謬狂妄的言論，我的名字早在東京的黑單上了。」</p>
<p>我說，「那時美國駐軍戒備的情形，又倒底怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>梅先生的回答是：美國人準備是的確有準備的，不過沒有想到日本人動手會這樣快。夏威夷六島之中，日僑的總數有十五萬人，在全人口五十萬人中佔到將近百分之四十。日本領事館裹雇用的特務工作人員，也有百人之多。各種有關夏威夷羣島美國軍事的情報，早已搜集得極爲詳細，所以這次轟炸的目標相當準確。相形之下，美國的反間諜工作就不免遜色了。</p>
<p>至於夏威夷華僑的人數，梅先生說一共在三萬人左右，其中有二萬五千人是生在夏威夷的，那就兼有中美兩國國籍了·這三萬華僑，百分之八十是廣東人，尤以廣東中山人爲更多。他們大多受過高等敎育，經營的事業也很發達，在當地都很有聲望。現在夏威夷就有兩家華僑所辦的銀行，還有很多信託公司。從事於其他各種商業的更多。</p>
<p>夏威夷的居民現在正從事於一種運動，想把夏威夷的地位，由「殖民地」而升爲「州」。但改「州」的計劃雖還一沒有實現，而夏威夷倒也已經有了牠自己的省議會。華僑之中，在省議會裘也有上議員二人，下議員六人。在檀香山市政府裏，有一位華僑任會計，另一位華僑任稽核，還有三位華僑任參事，都是相當重要的職位。此外，華僑中有三十七位醫師，三十五位牙醫生，一百五十位敎員（在美國學校中執敎）。華文報紙也有兩種。</p>
<p>今年六月中，有幾位華僑在夏威夷合辦了一個太平航空公司（Trans-Pacific　Airline），專在夏威夷六大島間飛行，創辦時資本祗有美金五十萬元，飛機也只有二引擎機三四架，但是到最近，一共不到三個月，資金已增加到美金一千萬元，飛機也已經增至二十五架，而且大都是四引擎巨型客機了。現在，太平公司的客機每天有八班飛行。他們極希望能够將航綫延展至祖國各埠，就是不知道政府能不能允許他們來。梅先生感動地說，「這些華僑的努力實在是値得欽佩的，如果能够讓他們協助中國空運事業的發展，對中國一定可以有很大的貢獻。中國規在雖然已有了幾家航空公司，但飛機實在還是太少。即以歸國省親的華僑來說，他們回來時搭乘飛機倒往往還沒有什麽困難，要回美國去時，賈飛機票就不大容易。如果提倡民營航空事業，就可以鼓勵他們回國視察，引起他們投資的興趣了。」</p>
<p>華僑在抗戰期間的確有很大的貢獻，無論購買公債，捐款，救國儲金，都非常踴躍。但是救國儲金一項，使他們相當失望，因爲這些儲金券現在的價値實在太低了。但是聽說政府現已採取具體步驟，預備依照華僑認購儲金日期的匯率，折合美金，然後照美金數額發還。梅先生以爲這件事一定能博得許多華僑的贊美，而且，爲將來着想，政府這樣做也未必會吃虧。</p>
<p>梅光生是廣東台山人，早歲留學美國。歐戰時任駐法華工靑年會幹事。民國十八年任外交部條約委員會委員。十九年任駐古巴公使館秘書。二十年任駐夏灣拿領事，同年調檀香山領事。二十三年升任檀香山總領事，一直到現在，在檀香山已經十五年了。因爲極得華僑人心，所以華僑特爲購地捐獻了一座極華麗的總領事館巨厦。抗戰期間，在國外抨擊日寇最力的，恐怕就是梅先生了。他最近預備到廣州去一次，看看他闊別已達十七年的親戚故舊。</p>

<p>現在中英交誼已有新約基礎</p>
<p>繼由潘公展氏談稱：上海係中英文化接觸之歷史性的主要中心，本人深知中英文化聯繫之重要，故雖在市參議會開會期中，特請假來此出席。戰時中英並肩作戰，終獲勝利。現在中英交誼，已有新的爲基礎，將來必更可親睦。英大使尙係新近來華，將來如有機會能至各地遊歷，常知中國實爲一愛好友人之國家，深信大使必能感覺愉快。上海係國際性都市，將來之發展，尙待友邦人士之協助。後蔡元培夫人談稱：中英兩國之留學生，如能多多互相交換，必可更可裨於兩國交誼。蔡先生在時，即常與威爾斯及蕭伯納等談及此事也。</p>
<p>英大使於全塲掌聲中，起立稱：中國於多年戰爭之後，於目下發展階段中，在其建國工作上，自亟需最佳頭腦之人之協助。在此項偉大工作上，尤以科學家負有重要之任務。倘渠等努力欲獲成功，余意諸位專家，必應貢獻其智識及觀念。因此余覺此項會議，對中國今後之科學與專門技術，必可產生一顯著之影響。</p>
<p>國際交換意見多所貢獻中國</p>
<p>大使繼復評論與其他國家交換意見之重要性，指出此種意見之交換，對有關各方必均有益。在此方面，西方各國實可多所貢獻中國，尤以科學技術及工業方面最新發展之情報為然。戰時英國在技術及科學方法上，已有驚人之發展。英國及英國科學家，亟願以其智識獻之諸君，並給予協助。大使繼復提及尼登博士在戰時與中英研究人員所作之偉大努力，渠等曾在長期對日戰爭中，於中國自由區中，協助中國科學家，且下尼登博士雖已返英，然英國科學家仍願協助中國之建國工作。大使又提醒會衆，謂中英文化委員會正樍極展開其工作，除以科學設備及科學工程期刋供給中國學術機關外，據大使所知，該會亦亟樂願協助中國科學家之優良工作。</p>
<p>施大使於結論時稱：余敢向諸君保證，由於英人亦曾飽受戰爭摧殘，故對於中國目前所面對之經濟與社會復元之艱鉅任務，頗能瞭解，吾人知悉君等之種種困難，謹在此祝諸君成功。</p>

<h3 id="c115">籃球賽　劉振元身籃有神助　空軍隊昨勝大華 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>一路佔先比數五十一對三九</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕南京空軍籃球隊訪滬第二戰，昨夜八時在市體育館與大華隊比賽，觀衆較第一塲爲多，蓋空軍前來參觀者極衆，彼等均能照章購票，實爲美德，比賽結果，上半時廿七對十七，總結果五十一對三十九，均空軍勝利，觀空軍表演，自有較首塲進步之處。</p>
<p>空軍進步</p>
<p>其進步之處，大致有三點：（一）釘人方法不若首戰時逼得太近而造成犯規，所謂已能處於敵人敵籃一人一手之距離。（二）遠射减少，則獲球權保持時間多，因此籃下球進襲亦多。（三）能懂得消耗時間，事實上電鐘在旁，儘可任何球員窺看時間，而處以相當之攻守也。大華打來，則散沙一盤，使空軍能儘量發揮。綜觀空軍，已能知所改善，則以其個人技術之優良，第三戰與汕隊之後，必能更具成績。</p>
<p>戰情經過</p>
<p>裁判金伯陶宜鶴皋，開始以後，空軍利用大華生疏，亡命進攻，秦循則首開紀錄，此後氣燄更盛，劉振元之射籃，似有神助，近籃直入，無不成功，大華賴許文奎之遠射，楊元龍之跟進，追隨於後，但相差時在四五球之數，上半時廿九對十九，客軍領前，下半時形勢依然，彼此雖頻多調換人事，局勢則始終如此，直至終塲，客軍終以五十一對三十九擊退大華。</p>

<p>市政府民政處昨分函各區公所云：査本市戶政人員集中調練日期，業經本處規定，函請査照在案。此項集中訓練主要目的，爲使各級戶政人員，瞭解戶籍法令，辦理初次戶籍登記過錄正確，故各級戶政人員應深體斯旨，匪勉受訓，並積極準備過錄工作。關於過錄方法，除依照前頒上海市各保戶口淸査後，過錄設籍登記簿注意事項規定外，茲復規定要點十四項於下：</p>

<p>（三）戶口複査工作，由保長曁保辦公處幹事督率全體甲長辦理，以一天完成爲原則，至遲應於二日內複査竣事。</p>
<p>（四）各區戶口複査標準日，規定如下：甲·第一區至第五區九月十七日。乙·第六區至第十四區九月廿四日。丙·第十五區至第廿一區九月廿九日。丁·第廿二區至卅二區十月三日。</p>
<p>（五）戶口複査，均以戶口複査標準日之戶口事實爲準。複査時以原存區公所之戶口調査表爲根據</p>
<p>（六）初次戶籍登記過錄，仍照注意事項規定，集中區公所辦理。過錄時，以兩人爲一組，一人過錄設籍登記簿流動人口登記簿，一人過錄遷入登記簿及統計條紙</p>
<p>（七）過錄設籍登記簿及過錄統計條紙，均以「戶口複査標準日」複査更正之戶口調査表爲準。</p>
<p>（八）戶口複査時，戶口調査表記載事項，與戶口事實不符時，應即就戶口調査表改正，如有戶口增加，應即另塡戶口調査表夾入，無空白調査表時，得以遷入聲請書代替，仍夾入戶口調査表內。如有戶遷出，即就原表註銷，均母庸再塡「遷出戶口淸册」，曁「戶口複査更正淸册」。</p>
<p>（九）一戶經複査後，不論有無改正或添註，一律應由戶長於戶長原蓋章處，加蓋名章，以示愼重。（十）戶口複査時，應逐戶通知戶長，於複査後，如有遷入。遷出·出生·結婚·離婚·收養·認領·死亡·等事項，應即依法爲登記之聲請。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市五洲貿易公司，以在戰前曾代客商向美國出口行及廠家，訂購貨物不下數十起，因戰事停頓，迄未交貨。現在和平重觀，營業如常，多數客商要求照約交貨，不願取還定洋，特函請市商會致函美大使館商務參贊，徵詢關於此類事件之處置，有無正式辦法，照約交貨。茲悉美大使館商務參贊，業將此事移交美商會研究答覆。經該會縝密考慮後，對戰前合約所取態度，業已縷述如後：</p>
<h3 id="c126">賣主所負責須依合約決定 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>（一）買賣雙方所訂合約，如列有慣常之「倘遇不測，天災人禍，雙方不負責任」等字樣，則該合約，應因戰事之發生而失效。惟買主若已預付定銀，貨品又訂明自美國港口運出，其貨價包括運費及保險費在內者，則貨品之所有權，並未轉移與買主，後者自可索還定銀，而賣主亦有退還之責任也。</p>
<p>（二）設若買主預付全部貨銀，原約又訂明船上交貨者，則不論列有「倘遇不測，天災人禍，雙方不負責任」等字樣與否，貨品之所有權已轉移與買主。倘戰爭時期貨品仍在賣主手中，買主有因負擔棧租及其他費用，或因貨品損壞而蒙受不必要乃至全部損失之處，故為免除此種損失計，賣主或有以最佳市價脫售貨品之義務。惟賣主僅係無報酬之受訊人，對於委託人之貨品，僅有略加照管之義務。倘非過分疎忽，固不能向其追究責任也。至若貨品以善價脫售後，賣主即成為貨款之保管人，應依美政府八三八九號凍結華僑資産修正法辦理。此外應予注意者，即貨品是否專為買主製造，抑或另行安置，附上標誌包裝待遇者。倘無此等標誌，亦無法辨別，則其所有權猶未轉移與買主。賣主即使對買主所付款項負有責任，但該款仍應依上述凍結資産法辦理。</p>
<p>（三）倘或合約無有「遇不測天災人禍，雙方不負責任」之條文，則賣主似當腹行原約。蓋法律並無明文規定，戰爭使敵國人民間之一切合約失效也。至於照合約起訴之權利，則暫時不能行使。惟原約應予履行之說，或僅限於戰爭爆發時，涉及財産權之案件。照一般情形言，敵對國家人民所訂之合約，難免涉及相互間之往來，從而有資敵之嫌，故應予取消廢業也。就若人所關心之上海與美國兩地居民間之合約而論，因上海曾被敵人佔領，本地居民應視同敵國僑民，故嚴格而論，上海進口商與美國賣主間之合約，應與敵國間之合約同樣辦理</p>
<p>（四）倘使引起糾紛之合約，係未涉貨品者，貨品由賣主交付運輸工具後，因戰事發生，而在運送途中喪失，則除非買主能證明賣主疎於選擇運輸工具所致。否則，其所蒙受損失，應向貨品保險人追還。至於能否取消賠償，當視貨運是否曾保兵險而定。</p>
<p>（五）按敝會曾　閱克伍夫氏所著法學書，其中關於因戰事而起訴之國際合約問題（第六卷十九至廿一章），對於各要點並未有所闡發，僅就德國與協商國商人間之法律訴訟，加以評述而已。倘若因合約問題而起訴訟，「起訴期限法」並不能引作抗辯之用。蓋此項法律，在戰爭時期失效也。深人上述各節，是以答覆貴會各會員關於解決戰前合約紐約之疑問也。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕證交於昨日上下午繼續演習交易交割及對帳手續。上午演習交易，因性質比較單純，經過尚稱良好。下午演習交割及對帳手續，因鑒於前日之失敗，昨日乃舉行分組交割對帳。每組十二人，由證交協理楊蔭溥，親自督導訓練。前後歷時僅一小時有半，結果各帳全部軋平。演習經過，證交當局認為已較日前進步多多。聞昨日全天仍將分組演習交割對帳手續，以資熟練。經紀人方面，聞亦有同感。故十二日正式開拍之期，決將延緩。</p>
<p>又證交當局現決接受經紀人若干建議，加以改進：（一）東西方廊黑板距離遼遠，字跡不易明辨，現決將字跡加倍擴大。暫時仍寫成交價格，將來可考慮事實需要，補注買賣價格。（二）為便利各經紀人計，各交易樞中，亦將設置黑板，報寫各股之成交及買賣價格。</p>
<p>證交於日前電呈經財兩部，請示兩點：（一）請從速頒佈交易稅征收辦法。（二）請示對保證金代用品部份之規定辦法。</p>
<p>又核准上市之廿種證券，因有若干發行公司，正辦理變更登記手續，對股票均改發臨時收據。茲悉，證交為體念事實上之困難計，對該項臨時收據，姑暫准預約轉讓云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪社會局糧食科吉明齊科長，據談，本市糧食危機業已過去，今後將步入佳境，前日吳市長於市參議會上謙稱，米糧政策失敗，實僅指推行糙米政策失敗，本市糧食危機最嚴重時期為六月下旬，根據六月二十四日之調查，全市米業，存米僅一萬二千八百四十石預計祗能供本市數日之需，且來源極稀，當時社會局只得採取配售政策，以資調節，且為求普遍供應起見，不論大小米店經同業公會證明後，得申請配售，一律以十包為限，蓋出於事實上之不得已，其後洋米來源已通，其他各地訂購之米亦源源到埠本局握有之米量較豐，故即發問售辦法。許各米號自由申請。儘量供給，米價乃得穩定，自七月四日起九月四日止。本局共售出各種米糧總計八萬二千另十四石九斗餘，據吉科長表示，現在存米數量極鉅，可以無限制供應，對於米價，政府希望能配合一般物價，不高漲，亦不暴跌，因高漲影響民生，暴跌則有害於農村也，吳市長曾有原則希望中等米價保持不超過四萬六千元之數目，吉科長又稱台灣産米甚豐，每年三熟，除供給台省民食外。尚可大量輸出，若台米輸入本市，則本市民食可不必再仰給洋米第一批，台米今日到埠。今後亦時將源源而來，另悉：如因米源暢通，米價過低時，政府亦擬收買云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市商會為營業稅按業分級徵收一案，頃又電呈財政部，有所建議。原電略云：查屬會依據各業建議，請將營業稅按業分級徵收一案，奉鈞部批示內開；據請按業分類酌定稅級各節，尚有可採，應留俟將來修正營業稅法時參考等因。查營業稅法，甫於本年四月十六日修正公佈，事關立法程序，既未易屢請修改/鈞部批示所謂：「將來修正」，在時間上距離不易預測。而各業對於營業稅稅率之急待合理調整，則為刻不容緩之事。本營業稅法第四條第一類，以營業總收入額為標準者，徵收其百分之一至百分之三。是稅法雖無分級辦法，但既有百分之一至百分之三幅度，非無留待分級徵收之餘地。現在各省市營業稅，既照修正之財政收支系統，改歸地方政府徵收，原任聽地方政府因地制宜，於單行章程內自行規定。乃此次八月十六日公布之營業稅法施行細則第十四條，有其他各業，一律就其營業總收入額徵收百分之一點五。是營業稅法第四條第一類原留有彈性規定，可為各省市政府酌定按級徵收之餘地者，以施行細則之剛性規定。改從一律，使各省市政府雖欲別訂單行章程，以期變通盡利，亦為之東縛無遺，實與鈞部此次批示所謂尚有可採之原意相反。查營業稅法施行細則之修正，較營業稅法之須經過立法程序者辦理較易。擬請鈞部俯賜呈院，將施行細則第十四條，改為營業稅稅率由各省市政府於擬具徵收營業稅單行章程時，就營業稅法第四條法定範圍之內，自行按級酌定。則鈞部此次第一八一五號所謂「尚有可採」之批示，可以不經過修改營業稅法之立法程序，即能見諸施行，似屬易於辦理，且可早慰商人　　之望。惟祈鈞部立予採擇施行。</p>

<h3 id="c135">現代國際組織學說與方式 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 平凡</p>
<p>鮑恩斯G．Delisle　Burns以爲現代文明，從經濟政治文化各方面看，都是全靠各民族間不斷的交通，才能有一種縝密的組織。可是現在這種經濟生活新狀態底理解，還脫離不了舊窠臼：還有許多人相信文化爲一種地方的產物；國聯制度底運用，還逃不了舊式外交的範圍；這都因爲各國沒有養成「國際的心理」。於是他著了一本「現代國際組織之學說與方式」來造成「國際的心理」，最近已譯成中文本，由商務印書館出售。</p>
<p>它先從經濟方面講：現代生活標準愈提高，物品供給的國際組織之用處也愈大；至少在經濟機能上國家的疆界或可廢止。次從文化方面講：科學藝術底發展，端賴能和別國接觸頻繁。現代文化在各地底根源，雖然還是國家的，種族的；但其燦爛的花朶，都必須國際的了。再次從政治方面講：現代國家如不同別國合作，即對於自己人民不能盡其職責；每一個國家商業工業運輸財政衛生敎育等行政機關，都要與其他國家底同類機關通力合作才好。所以爲政的藝術，關於防衛方面己日見減少，關於國際組織方面則日益加多。防衛的觀念，總免不了使任何自以爲善的國家，以擴充境域爲防衛底最好方法。祗要這種以防衛他國政府爲任何國家所必要的觀念還存在，可能的仇敵也必存在。祗要有了以某國政府爲可能仇敵的猜疑，就會毒害國際交通的全部，並阻止國家制度State　systom底現代化。現代國家從根本上講，乃爲「佔據全球的單一政府底一部」——因此，每一個政府純然爲其人民用作帮助別國人民底工具；偵探及別種戰爭準備都已成陳腐的觀念了。</p>
<p>照鮑氏這種論據演繹起來，那現今流行底什麽主權原則，什麽國家主義，自然都根本不能成立。如果各國人民都能養成這樣互相信賴的國際心理。一般理想家所渴望的「世界國家」，自不難實現。還有什麽戰爭？不但軍縮可馬上實行，連國際警察也無須大規模的組織了。豈非人類大幸。却是不辛得很，事實吿示我們完全與此相反！</p>
<p>就光從經濟說吧，自十八世紀工業革命以來，資本隨生產力而增加，國內市塲不足供其發展不得不向國外力求市堪，「世界交通」遂亦隨之而發達。然後起之國，不甘忍受此種經濟侵略者，因提倡國家主義以相抵抗，其勢均力敵者；更假國家主義以爭覇稱雄。於是國家主義的經濟學，遂繼正統派自由經濟之後應運而興。經濟鬥爭旣愈演愈烈，政治鬥爭自亦隨之而日烈，馴致戰爭爲政治工具之說，一時竟成爲政治家之信條。於是第一次世界大戰，遂隨之而爆發。戰後列强不但無悔禍之心，而所謂「均勢」，所謂「武裝和平」，仍爲國際政治之核心。威爾遜高唱之十四條，實際上全未施行；而所謂「經濟的國家主義」則奉爲經濟政策之　科玉律。國際聯盟不過是列强互相利用底工具；那班不願受利用的，便另成一壁壘來相抗爭。於是第二次世界大戰，又隨之而起。牽入戰爭漩渦的多至七十國，傷亡軍民四五十萬，耗費美金一萬萬萬餘元，爲禍之慘，遠過第一次。經過這麼一次浩刦，論理應該痛改前非了。可是一九四二年八月宣佈底大西洋憲章，列强遵守了嗎？不擴張，不擅改疆土，不千涉內政底諾言，實踐了嗎？聯合國底組織，表面上似比國聯進步，但是五强底吾決權，與國聯行政院一致決議底規定，有什麽區別？美蘇底摩擦衝突，不是比當年英法還要表面化嗎？十九世紀所唱的「均勢」，「武裝和平」那一套舊調，不是還在那裏流行嗎？國防預算數字，比國聯時代大得多呢；軍縮那種高調，簡直無人提了！</p>
<p>在這種國際情形之下，什麼科學藝術敎育，都不免要爲自私自利的民族主義，或階級鬥爭底手段。那自命爲「主宰民族」的德國，固不消說；其他自詡爲文明先進國的，又何嘗不以宣揚本國文化爲已任；於是政治侵略和經濟侵略之外，又有所謂文化侵略。現在蘇聯所領導的社曾主義國家集團與英美所領導的民主主美國家集團，彼此預防文化侵略，好像防疫。蘇聯雖加人了聯　國，面屬　聯　國底文　委員會農業糧食會議，竟拒不參加，還談什麽文化交流，文化合作！</p>
<p>同是一種「世界交通」，何以竟有這樣不同的觀點？何以有的認爲可以促進國際和平，有的反認爲可以促進國際戰爭呢？何以認爲國際和平，至今還是空想，而認爲促進國際戰爭的，且竟成爲事實呢？歸根結底說起來，還是要推到西洋人傳統的人生觀。西洋人傳統的人生觀，徹頭徹尾是鬥爭的人生觀。這種人生觀應川到政治上，便是强權政治。現今政治支配一切，經濟文化都不免要做它底附屬品。甚至於宗敎也有時被它利用做手段。强權政治底結果，沒有不是戰爭的。戰爭底口號，沒有不說是爲主權，爲民族國家的。本來做國家主義底精髓的「主權原則」，是歐洲文藝復興時代底一種假設。好比封神榜上底黃飛虎，西遊記底齊天大聖孫悟空，原本無此怪物，可是後來有人利用宣傳，居然到處有人立廟奉祀；而東嶽大帝城隍廟，還載在祀典，每月朔望知縣都要向它磕頭燒香呢？在有識者看來，眞是有荒唐又滑稽，幾乎要笑破肚子。然而大家都這樣說，都這樣崇拜，你獨說是假的，誰肯相信呢？</p>
<p>就是鮑氏本人，照這本書有來，也不免深受西洋社會思想底拘束。因爲西洋那種人生觀所形成的社會思想，是純粹的功利思想；他們認爲沒有利不値得競爭的事情，便不能引起興會。所以他根據「世界交通」來說世界和平，是把各國的經濟文化政治等，都作爲有「交換價値」看待。這種以「交換價値」爲基調的學說，仍然免不了計較私利的市儈思想。殊不知見利爭先的人利盡則交疏，或反相賊害：這種國際朋友是靠不住的。縱令完全如他底願，造成了普通的「國際心理」，恐怕還是不能促進國際和平；恐怕國際愈交通，國際戰爭還要愈快愈多！因爲爭權奪利的人生哲學不根本糾正，戰爭是無法避免的。只有拿儒家「仁義的人生觀」來養成「國際的心理」糾正這種錯誤；庶幾「佔據全球的單一政府制度」，有實現的可能；世界和平方有最後的保障。仁義之說：單就表面看，似乎有些無所爲而爲；其實「義者利之本也」，結果沒有不利的呀！像鮑氏這樣思想高尙的人，還不免在舊式的功利主義範閣內兜圈子，不曉得拿仁義之說來勸說和平，更爲遠大而有效，殊覺有點可惜。然而像現今世界都說鬥爭，正說得頭昏腦悶的時候，鮑氏這本書，却不愧爲一帖難能可貴的淸凉劑。</p>
<h3 id="c136">評「中學音樂敎材」 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 張定和</p>
<p>音樂敎育協進會發行　福州路中國印書館經售</p>
<p>許多年來，許多在中學校敎音樂的朋友們，常常要我介紹書樂敎材。因爲近幾年後方沒有新的敎材出版，我就祇是零星地選擇了一些歌曲給他們。我自己也覺得這種介紹方法實是毫無系統，並且還缺少在歌曲以外的各種敎材。心裏就一直在想着，應該有一本完備的敎材來補救敎材荒。自己亦很有試一試編一本的意思，無奈：（一）疏學淺，（二）缺少參考書，因此就擱下了。</p>
<p>沒有想到音樂敎育協進會的諸位先生也早已不約而同的有了這側意思，且在六年前即着手編寫這部「中學音樂敎材」了。我是最近才得到這消息，即刻向編者借來原稿，拜讀之餘，覺得這三本敎材（分上中下三册）是再理想不過的敎材了。我相信，出版後不久，中國的中等學校的音樂程度一定會因之大大提高，而合乎標準。簡接地，中國的音樂敎育也必將受此書的影響而普及，並提高程度。</p>
<p>那米，這敎材的優點在那裏呢？</p>
<p>簡單地說：它的樂理，唱歌及欣賞三者是並重的。歌曲的先後，是依據樂曲的難易，更依着時令的先後及作曲者的年代而排列，使學生在不知不覺中得到進步，也就是說：在不知不覺中對音樂史，對音樂的形式，及對各個時代的作曲家及其風格能够有一個明確的記憶。並且，這書裏所選的歌曲，旋律優美，結構完整，音域適宜。歌詞與旋律及節奏又都極爲適合。</p>
<p>要依照以上的優點來作爲編輯的原則，這是一件相當困難的事。而這幾位　者却去做了，而且做成了。他們根據多年敎學的經騐來認眞編寫（有此在於材中雖僅為淡淡幾句，但也曾參考了很多書籍，甚至於有是來自長篇傳記的。）原稿曾經　度增删整理，現在將要出版　不得不使人欽佩。它們有嚴肅的學者態度，你如果見到這敎材，亦必將有同感。</p>
<p>在這三册書裏，你是沒有方法看見編者中任何一個人的名字的。許多歌詞的譯者及作者，雖爲編者中某個人所譯或所作，但却全用「編者」出面。並且聽說在初次的原稿中有許多歌曲是編者的作品，而現在却純以音樂敎育的立塲作客觀態度的編訂，把那些歌曲全部取消了。這都是他們學者態度嚴肅的解釋。可是，我還是要來拆穿一下：在編者中有一位是錢仁康先生，假如你曾經翻閱過中華書局出版的金仕唐譯的「樂理與作曲」（Prestonware　orem原著）一書，你會發現那譯者的名字與錢先生的名字有着部份相同的關係。那本書遠在十年前付印，可見錢先生的嚴肅的學者態度實是一貫的。用這種態度來編輯敎材，學生亦必將於不知不覺中受到良好影響。</p>
<p>但是，這部敎材有着一個缺點，就是現在付印的版子的字體太小，這是有損學生目力的，希望將來能改用較大字體。</p>
<p>不過，無論如何，這部「中學音樂敎材」是一部非常値得介紹的書。因爲：它不僅在對我個人方面完成了我的「試一試編一本」（這是就我個人而言，）也不僅在學校方面補救了敎材荒的遺憾，並且在整個中國的音樂敎育上它是一支强大無比的生力軍。</p>

<p>秦宏濟著　卅四年九月商務渝版</p>
<p>近代專利制度，確立於英國專賣條例（一六二三），到現在不過三百多年，在各種制度中間，本較後起。我國從民國成立以後，政府對於工業技術，迭經公布各項獎勵法規，却始終沒有設立發明專管機關。抗戰朋間，物資缺乏，爲謀自給自足，增加抗戰力量起見，工業技術獎勵，益爲政府首長及社會賢達所密切注意，誠以工業進步，有賴國際間技術之交流，在工業落後國家，要迎頭趕上，允應利用專利制度，藉以加强吸收國外最新之發明。迨三十三年五月國民政府即正式公布專利法，期於抗戰勝利後一二年間，付之實施，但專利制度，在國內尙爲新創，諸如（一）專利制度之理論（二）我國專利法之要點（三）發明人應如何呈請專利及如何確保其權益（四）製造廠應如何善爲利用專利權等重要問題，即技術專家，亦多未能十分明瞭。抗戰勝利以後，專利法之實施，固已爲期不遠，而我國工商界與歐美各工廠間，接觸頻繁，更有時常涉及專利問題的可能。國內出版界以往還沒有一種讀物，足以適應此種需要，秦宏濟先生這本書，正好彌補了這個缺憾。</p>
<p>作者是一位工程師，曾任經濟部簡任技正，主辦取　行政多年實爲編著這本書最適當之人選。原稿並經敎育　學術審議會依照「獎勵著作發明及美術品規則」，給予獎勵。書中第一至第二章，就專利制度的起源與沿革，以及我國專利制度的演進，作槪括性的敍述，第三至第六章，詳論可以專利之發明，曁發明，新型及新式樣之本質，第七至第九章述呈請專利之要點，及專利機構之審査程序，第十至十四章分論專利權之效力，侵害，實施曁勞資問權益分配，第十五至第十七章，敍述「保護工業所有權國際公的」之內容，以及重要工業國家現行法規等項。</p>
<p>這本書在重慶出版，京滬等地，現在或也可購到，筆者閱讀一過，可以提出申述者，計有四端（一）全書取材審愼，資料豐富，國內若干統計及解釋，向未公開發表，所引外國成例及法院判例，允屬不易得見，書中有所徵引，均於章末註明出處，頗便復按。（二）全書用客觀態度，關於法律方面之解釋，儘量引用「判例」或「解釋」原文，不作空泛說明（三）　請專利所必須之說明書，不論國家所採政策，爲審査主義或發明人權利主義，均極重要，原書提綱挈領，可稱完備，但若能多引實際例證，對一般工商業讀者，裨益更多（四）我國專利法雖已公布，尙未施行，原書對於呈請程序，僅就現行法規，分別闡述，將來專利法施行條例，及專利局組織法曁共他有關法規，相繼公布，原書若干部份，亟待補充。聞作者已脫離行政工作，受聘爲工程師，仍盼於再版時重加修訂，以成完整。</p>

<h3 id="c141">梅花的記憶 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— 謝紫</p>
<p>我對於梅花的愛，毌寧是一種眷戀。小時候我不大注意梅花，只覺得它有一種清冷的香氣，使人神往。從前我們住在一個荒僻的縣份裏，我的臥室窗外恰巧有兩株古梅。有時候天色剛亮，滿地雪光已經把窗戶照得白瑩瑩的；　然而在白瑩瑩的窗紙上有着黑影，正像是用淡墨描成的梅花。這時候半夢半醒，只覺得一陣陣清冷的香氣使人沉醉，彷彿是參雜着夢寐的現實。</p>
<p>三年以前，當我二十歲的時候，偶然買了一本林逋的詩。這詩集也有一種清冷的格調，如同梅花。其中詠梅的詩特別多，這些詩我都是就讀成誦的。我覺得林逋對梅花的愛，也是一種眷戀，也許因為林逋的愛太纖細，太深微，在這世界上找不到一個能够懂得他的女孩子，所以才梅妻鶴子的。他雖然是一個清高的隱士，卻那樣的一往情深。他時常對着梅花訴說他的癡想，愛慕它，讚頌它，以至於不能自己。梅花得到了這樣一個知音，在它那素潔的花瓣上，是應　增添一抹紅暈的。</p>
<p>也許是受了某種的感染吧，我也變的愛梅花了；雖然我的性格并不像林逋那樣的高潔淡雅，不過在情感上，我也是Sentimental的。我再四朗誦着林逋的詩，覺得有一種秘的幽情，使人心醉。我心裏增添了一種渴望，愛着梅花，想着梅花，而終於邂逅了梅花。</p>
<p>那年秋天，我在大學裏認識了一位美麗的女孩子—美得清麗，美得　逸，美得楚楚可憐。她名字叫的梅，也許就是梅花的靈魂吧？我永遠不會忘記我第一次看到她時所感到的惶惑。她勻整的面容，輕盈的身材，以及她溫靜清靈的性格，組成一個完美的，然而不很實際的人。至少在這擾攘的紅塵中，該說是一種奇跡。我禁不住心裹積壓了許久的熱情，我對自己說：「現在你真碰到梅花了，這梅花是不會凋謝的，不止在你心裏，還在你眼前，你應該怎樣珍惜這美麗的時刻啊！」這美麗的時刻真的來：說不完的愛，數不清的夢。然而只是短暫的一年，這咱纖細的愛是使人窒息的，窒息得透不過氣來。</p>
<p>也許就為了這，也為了對於美的虔誠，我離開了梅，噙着眼淚離開了她。我做了個可憐的殉美者！此後我依舊生活在擾攘的紅塵裏，碰到許多美麗的女孩子，正像碰到許多美麗的花朵一樣，可是無論如何，我是不會愛她們的，我已經不能愛，我的愛已經隨着梅花的記憶葬埋了。以後我一直要用眼淚來灌漑它，灌漑這美麗的花朵—也許是情感和想象交織而成的梅花吧！</p>
<p>可是我為什麼這麼拘執！在這萬紫千紅的世界裏，我就只愛梅花，并且經過了這一段悽愴回憶的點染，所有的梅花對於我，都彷彿是解語的。</p>
<p>然而我的心終有點變了，不是變而是抑制，我已經決心做一個平凡的人，把全部精神放在事業上，使自己忘懷一切。再不然就到歡樂場中去走走，找尋刺激，找尋麻醉。可是，不管我的生活糜爛到怎樣的地步，這一段梅花的記憶是依舊要「放在水晶瓶子裏，用雙手捧着的」。</p>
<p>幾天以前，有一個親戚又提起了梅，原來牠們是相識的。她只知道梅是個美麗的女孩子，過去是我的同學。她希望我們再度相見。牠說得那麼平淡，卻不知道我在心裏激起了幾許痛楚。幾年來違心的生活，已經把我的痛苦和快樂，一律掩埋了，我不希望再有新的波動。我不能想，我不敢想，應該怎樣想呢？假如我們還有重逢的一天，面面相對！</p>
<p>我只有橫一心來阻止這可能的幸福，也許是可能的痛楚！讓這一段梅花的記憶在我心裏保持着它的晶瑩吧！經過了歲月的沖洗，經過了風霜雨雪的摧殘，它還是那麼鮮明，那麼深摯。這一點神秘的源泉是不會枯竭的。我願意盡我的力量，為梅花創造一個晶瑩的世界，在那兒，沒有痛苦，沒有煩怨。那兒的梅花是帶着紅暈的，那照在梅花上的陽光是永生的。</p>
<h3 id="c142">眼淚 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 江淮</p>
<p>眼淚貫穿我　串的歲月，反覆浸淫着自己的辛酸與一些歡　的笑意…</p>
<p>每每在兩底日子。深思便牽引我淚眸那窗外的天之淚。鉛重般塵封的心境，也頓移棄太蒼的靈　了！尤當暗無星星永夜的滴雨，一再撥動隱現的淚痕時，共鳴之中，又往往觸動兩道新的泉流了。</p>
<p>也許朋友總看着我以懦弱的姿態來決入淚的泉源；可是我卻不願在他們之間，有對於我排泄這些苦汁的探詢。（雖然也有點點的葡萄滋味…）我寗可孤寂地獨味其味。</p>
<p>但我可相仿多少我已掘也過一些人生的真諦。眼淚之於生活，正猶如大地暑氣，被滂沱大雨沖洗得一片清涼；荷塘的運葉，在乍晴之前，藉以洗刷得沁人心脾一樣。我相信：在人世間的罪惡·殘酷·野心·跋扈以及滿面猙獰的面龐上，是不會本性地流着他們底淚的。而真正一顆絕不虛飾的淚光，倒可以用來察鑒自己的生命，像小草花接受了露珠的潤澤，去迎待朝陽加強了它底生機！</p>
<p>當我看到一個天真的孩子，無邪的臉龐上掛上了兩　小燈籠；一位龍鍾老態的聖母，在閃忽她慈悲的螢光；一群無家可歸的人們為了生活。默默地申訴着無慰的晶珠，以及那些戰士流下忠勇之瓊漿；奮門者讓一切的挫折，無聲地忍受在淚之中…呀！雖都不比，血一般的現實，鐵一般的堅強；然而，卻是老遠超越了那些無恥的　笑以上！…</p>
<p>淚—讓自己自然地流下去吧！憑這個天賦的本能，在枕畔案頭，深山大澤，洗　一下自己底雙手，再滴在倔強的腳背上，然後檢起來，珍惜地放在自己生活的盤中。在深暗的隧道上，在黑夜，在無邊陰沉的大地裏，看閃耀的光輝，照着自己前進罷！</p>
<h3 id="c143">秋話 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 江上青</p>
<p>一年容易，又到了梧桐落葉的涼秋季節；年紀大了一些，對於季節也特別關切起來。小時候，每逢初秋，墻邊屋角，跟着一些野孩子們捉蟋蟀，每晚巡邏於曠野之間，燈影人面，想起來還彷彿如昨。我父親是一個整天喝酒不管閒事的糊塗虫，每到秋天晚上，醉眼婆娑，指着天上，口裏說着那一粒是天王星，海王星，那一條是銀河，於是接着嘆息於自己的年華老大，現在和秋天一樣充滿了　　與寂寞。</p>
<p>依照中國詩人們的說法：秋天是象徵着人生的中年，風鳴木禿，黃葉飄蕭，一派淒清景象，確和春夏不同。歷史上多感的詩人們，生活在這種境地裏，雖然自傷身世，祇有說「送春無語」；何況在「淚眼問花花不語，落紅飛過秋千去」之後，咀嚼起「昨夜西風凋碧樹，獨上高樓望盡天涯路」呢？於是祇落得：「簾捲丁風，人比黃花瘦」；更何況千古來多少曠男怨女，眼看着春變着夏，夏變着秋，思鄕懷舊，眷戀過去，人非木石，孰能無情，於是不惜：「衣帶漸寬終不悔，為伊消得人憔悴」。</p>
<p>辛幼安有一首醜奴兒的詞，描寫少年和中年人的心理，叫做：「少年不識悉滋味，愛上層樓，愛上層樓；為賦新詞強說愁。而今識得愁滋味，欲說還休，欲說還休；卻道天涼好個秋」，大抵秋天多給人以幻想，少給人以溫軟：紅葉點點，宛似離人之淚，於是勞人思婦，低吟於「今日卻成鸞鳳友，方知紅葉是良媒」的詩句，不禁傷懷欲絕。其實秋來秋去，都不管人閒事，而人們卻硬把自己的眼淚問花，把感情種愁；「天若有情天應老」上帝無情，而人們卻鏡裏朱顏，換了滿鬢星霜。</p>
<p>看秋雲如羅，變幻莫測，天際林梢，掛着一片白帆，向黃葉叢中駛去，有　然一老，策杖於板橋之上；水自東流，人將西逝。遠處有一中年婦人，曝衣西樓，看一對水鷗上下，憑欄凝思，不知她何思何想。更遠去：一片荒涼，風吹草低，牛羊點點，於夕陽斜照之中跳躍追逐。此情此景，每人都多少經歷過的。回首如夢夢如煙，偶然想及，真叫人想極，愛極，恨極，愁極。</p>
<p>「是誰窗外種芭蕉，朝也蕭蕭，暮也蕭蕭」一個人感情到無可發洩時，往往不免怨起各種事物起來；而其實，又往往是：「是君心緒太無聊，種了芭蕉，怨了芭蕉」。</p>
<p>執筆恨惘，想起這幾年飄泊過來，自己祇永遠像在秋天中找紅花一樣覺到失望。「秋風無賴客無衣」秋天畢竟是給予人以蕭索的憶念。</p>

<p>您或者要對筆者反唇相譏了：「就你現在所寫的這部長長的傳奇，至少十之五六，是關於我方反間諜工作的報導，難道這裏面這些人物腳色連一個「在繼續工作」的也沒有？縱令有的已經改變職務，像對方那樣的小器，下作，詭譎，而且帶正在種種掩護之下，積極活動，整理，準備；到了時候，必定要「再來一個」「應懲」「全滅」，難道他們不注意這些人嗎？</p>
<p>關於這，我可以明白的報告您；我所寫的這些人物，一部分是很可痛惜的榮譽犧牲了；還有一部分說得神秘些，鬼子們是無法探索得到的；再有一部分，在鬼子的重要秘冊上，對於他們每個人，都有詳細的記載，那些國際「戰犯」的重要魔星們也認識他們，有的還同他們有過杯酒以上的交往，可是這些腳色，也許說得過分一點，他們真有些神龍變化之妙，鬼神不測之　。鬼子要想對於他們有什麼舉動的話，我怕有些辦不到哩。</p>
<p>然而，鼉有許多「繼續」有關係的行動，別說我，恐怕任何人也不便寫出，也不必寫出。譬如現在W君在耀群這裏談話的一部分，確屬不必寫出。僅僅關於誓約上的幾個原則，倒不妨發表一下；W君在說明了誓約的性質和人事組織之後，繼續說：</p>
<p>「…除了這些大綱節目以外，我們還有一個「三有」主義：不貪功；二，不惜犧牲，然而又不可作無謂的犧牲；三，不動搖。所謂不動搖，涵義比較廣一點；總而言之，就是始終守持正義，在任何惡劣環境之下，「富貴不能淫…威武不能屈。」附帶還有一個重要的條件；那就是「操守」…」</p>
<p>W君說到這裏，不禁嘆了一口氣，轉過身來，對我說了一個故事，關於「操守」的話：</p>
<p>還是在七七日寇正式挑　之前，他們為了想兵不血刃，侵佔華北，所以實行松岡的落破戶主義「武裝走私」。我方的反間諜組織趕緊派了一票同志，去跟那般浪人奸商對壘。其中有一位青年同志，一向勤奮工作，志氣也十分高超。</p>
<p>有很長的一個時期，這位青年，都能守住崗位。後來他收到一封家信，說他母親病重，醫藥營養，在在需錢。您知道，我們的特務同志，雖是幹的斬頭瀝血的工作，恰也同士兵一般，待遇有等級，而且很是菲薄。</p>
<p>這位同志，正在一策莫展的當口，偏巧捉住了一票私貨。照平日的行為，他可以對抗一切，實行「公事公辦」。可是臨到這個迫切需款，而又阮囊羞澀的環境中，他竟屈服了，收了幾百元的運動費，放過了私貨。這件事可以說絕對「神不知鬼不覺」；因為特務機關對於每位同志，完全取的信任主義。</p>
<p>這位青年同志，在自信力方面；他認為絕對「祇此一遭下不為例」。誰知這類的事，一次破例，無論這個例，破的大與小，正如堤壩上掘了一個缺口，非至洪波泛濫不可，俗話說「久做必犯」；所以這位同志就被逮住槍斃了。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>參議會開會今天已是第四天，三天來的經過情形，作為市民之一，對於我們的代表，可以說非常滿意，因為我們的代表確已做到知無不言，言無不盡了。特別值得一提的，就是有兩位參議員原為參政員，寗願辭去參政員而就參議員，為地方服務，這種從基本工作着手的精神，足為將來地方自治樹立楷模，是該受讚佩的一件事。</p>
<p>大上海地區遼闊，人口眾多，環境也複雜，應興應革的工作很多，尤其經過八年來敵偽的盤踞，真是千頭萬緒，市政當局雖有向上的決心，然而耳目或有所未週，方法或有所欠缺，有市參議會，正如車之雙言，或提議或質詢，儘管激昂慷慨，疾顏厲色，儘管針鋒相對，咄咄逼人：但決不是冤家仇人，故意刁難，倘使神經過敏，以為某某與我有私怨，某某因某事不開心…那便是鑽入牛角尖，祇有官僚主義者才會如此想法。</p>
<p>上海是個大都市，市參議會與市政府的合作，應該有為全國示範的作用，我們固然信賴我們的代表，將我們的意思不折不扣地說出來，但我們更願我們的提出來的，市政府不敷衍，能誠意地予以考慮執行。</p>
<p>市參議會的會期尚有九天，成果可期，特為預祝。</p>

<p>— 崇楨</p>
<p>巨匪楊××反正了，我們略有所感。回憶楊××的名字，過去是不大知名的，由於他當過漢奸，做過土匪，現在又反正了；因此我們又漸漸的認識了他，原來是個慣於變戲法的角色。</p>
<p>他的三部曲是：漢奸，土匪，反正。敵偽時代，江南的角落裏，楊四太爺的大名，幾乎無人不知，紅極一時，歷任偽蘇省保安司令部參謀長，偽吳江，無錫縣長等識，其時，作威作福，無所不為。他所管轄境內的民眾，無不切齒痛恨入骨。</p>
<p>勝利降臨，也就是他的末日。楊××知事不妙，難逃法綱，於是，搖身一變，繼續幹那歹徒的勾當，竄入太湖淪為匪魁。楊入太湖以後，招兵買馬，廣羅匪徒，約有五百餘人及船十四隻，盤踞平臺山附近，樹起「江南民主聯軍司令部」旗識，自任總司令，仍然做土皇帝。洗刦周圍村舍，以致於太湖附近幾縣如蘇州，無錫，吳江，宜興等地，秩序不安，治安艱難。</p>
<p>當局對此事極為關懷，陸軍副總司令湯恩泊將軍，已飭令第一綏靖區李司令默痷，限期清剿，以杜匪患。楊匪聞悉後，知再無立足之餘地，乃居然正大光明的反正了。</p>
<p>其實，他的一套戲法，眾人皆知，做過漢奸，抓到是要槍斃的，只好入「主」太湖，暫時躱避一下，等到大家的目光都轉移了，認為他是一個土匪，他非常開心，當然就乘此良機反正。不僅土匪之罪名取消，連漢奸的一筆舊賬也一筆勾銷了。</p>
<p>今天，雖然他在自白，謂一向杜門養晦，從未入湖為匪，願在政府領導下從事綏靖工作，講得如何動聽，勝聽清歌一曲。</p>
<p>他的三套戲法，當漢奸是甘心賣國，做土匪是解脫漢奸罪名的橋樑，反正是得道。</p>
<p>我們不敢說連改過自新的機會都予抹煞，但放下屠刀一下子就得道，未免有些「那個」！</p>

<p>交易所名稱，各國不一，我國舊時稱為「懋遷公司」民國法律上，始正式名為「交易所」</p>
<p>中國第一家成立之交易所，為北京證券交易所，時在民國七年八月一日開幕，此為上海有交易所之第一家。</p>
<p>上海交易所事業，在民國十年夏秋之間，最稱發達，有百四十餘家，但不數月竟同歸於盡，世稱「民十風潮」</p>
<p>戰前上海五大交易所為證券，金業，紗布，麺粉，雜糧，以證券，紗布交易最為蓬勃。</p>
<p>在我的陳舊頑固腦袋裏，深刻着交易所是投機場所，從業員是投機朋友。</p>
<p>據說：投機與賭博絕對不同。投機商經驗知識判斷力以定得失；而賭博以僥倖身利為目的。</p>
<p>上海消費市場的繁榮，大半要靠投機商來支持的。</p>
<p>有人估計：交易所投機失敗者和交易所起家者的比數，恰和法幣與偽幣二百作一相同。</p>

<p>——他由之石</p>
<p>到過香港的人，誰都會覺得香港電車的便利與舒適，且有美感。牠永恒地披著綠色的嶄新的外衣，有上下二層，高高的，　一具匣了一般在山之下，海之濱，輕快地行進著。</p>
<p>香港電車之多，真可說得上一句鱗次櫛比，早晨，白天，黃昏，無論任何時間，你從家里出門走到站頭，總有著一輛停著的電車，專誠地等待著你乘搭，乘客不會有爭先恐後的現象，對於一輛車子的過去，決不會有留戀或婉惜的心情，因為第一輛開了，不消一分鐘，第二輛就追蹤而至，決不會有久等或搭不到的。</p>
<p>車子上，門雖設而當不關，而沒有一個乘客會站在月臺上，或在行駛中失足的，因此，乘客進出自如，到站不必等待賣票老爺的開門，在早晨，你便可以見到一個個衣服楚楚的富家娘姨，挽著滿筐的魚肉蔬菜，安閒地扶著電車內的柱子站著，雖然小菜場距離家里不過如先施公司距離大新公司般一箭之路，但是娘姨們決不肯放棄這個便利的代步工具。</p>
<p>每輛車子不會有人滿之患，頭等的上層，常是疏疏落落的一個人，都是外國人和高等華人很多，普通人的不坐頭等，與其說是省內個錢，不如說是上下樓梯不方便，然而在傍晚的時候，仍有不少休閑的人士，坐在頭等的最前排上，遊車河，乘風涼，看看市景，這可以說是一種價格廉特美，無以上之的娛樂。</p>
<p>香港人口的密度，比上海大得多，然而在香港乘電車是那麼一件方便的樂事，在上海是那麼一件麻煩的苦事，一句話，不過在車輛的多與少而已。</p>

<p>記宣司令的談片</p>
<p>半年來，上海的交通一直在紊亂中。</p>
<p>說句原諒當局的話，其實，當局也并不是對此問題置之不理，而是在這極複雜的大上海，各式車輛與日俱增，要想在短時期內求得掃善的處置，殊非易！而且，一種辦法之產生，總難達於特殊階級。</p>
<p>上月廿二日，宣司令參加上海校同學聯誼會聚餐時，曾經談及上海交通問題。</p>
<p>宣司令說：「我今天以同學的立場忠告各位同學，對於上海的車輛（包括汽車卡車吉普車等）我曾經通令屬各機關都必須車子有照會，當這個通令下了以後，首先服行的是全市美軍的車輛，他們沒有一輛是沒有照會的。然而倒反是我們自己的軍用車，吉普車等不能一一遵辦。我僅以同學身份希望在場的諸位，如果有車子而沒有照會的，應談速即辦理手續去領照會，否則將來查到了，不能怪我！」</p>
<p>最近，吳市長主持之改善交通會議決定的辦法，已於九月九日起嚴格執行，車輛犯規三次者吊銷執照。這幾天，馬路的交通好像好了一些，隨便什麼時間，假使你要經過馬路時腦筋裏會覺得交通的秩序已有轉變。</p>
<p>但我們於此，迫切希望的還是：大家遵守交通法規，不要以軌外行動為榮！否則，在任何情形之下，上海的交通是沒有希望的！</p>

<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>四川省政府主席張羣，九日午後到滬，十日晨八時，怱怱從上海江灣機場，乘坐專機飛赴美國。據說張氏此次出國，係治療左頷下的毒癌，這癌發生在一年前，真實不感痛癢，最近稍覺不快，經西醫判明為毒癌，張氏遵從勸告，便赴美國求醫。筆者借此機會，把這一位「軍人出身的政治家」的生平軼事，拉雜談述：</p>
<p>在日本求學</p>
<p>張氏字岳軍，四川華陽人，生於光緒十三年。在保定陸軍速成學校畢業以後，便投入東京日本陸軍士官學校，他就在這時參加留日學生組織的同盟會。辛亥革命，與蔣主席同由日本回滬，任職上海軍都督府科長，第二十三師團長，民國六年，任大元帥府參軍及軍政府職務，八至九年，辦理四川全省警務，十三至十四年，負責整頓河南省警務。北伐時，任總司令部總參議，并主持南昌行營事務，其後任為軍事委員會委員，十七年三月，任上海兵工廠長，十月改任軍政部政務次長及兵工署長兼同濟大學校長。十八年當選中央執行委員，同年四月一日任上海市長，二十一年一月辭職。其後，任湖北省政府主席，行政院秘書長，四海省政府主席以至今日。</p>
<p>任滬市長時</p>
<p>張氏在上海市長任內，當地小報，曾刊載消息，謂張氏遭人狙擊，結果其保鑣受傷。張氏置之一笑，其實張氏一生行事，一秉至公，以為當無開罪於人，所以從來不雇用保鑣。張氏初到上海，賃居呂班路一小屋，友人鄭某勸其喬遷，張氏答以　體不多，無力置宅，鄭某願將亞爾培路自居房屋出讓，議定給價二萬元，不料時隔三月，張氏仍舊兩袖清風，無力付款，後來改為分期償清，購屋事始告一段落。</p>
<p>張氏和蔣　主席中　也曾有一則佳話：當陳英士烈士任上海都督時，蔣主席與張氏同隸部下，某日冬夜，張氏因某項重要軍機，入蔣主席辦公室商洽，事涉複雜神秘，兩人均不能即時取決，低首沈思，久不交談，朔風砭　嚴寒欲僵，兩人對坐，呆似木鷄。蔣度席旣未作答，張氏也不再言，竟至東方大明。</p>
<p>這次張氏赴美就醫，竟有人猜測謂彼負有重大使命，關係方面已經表示不確。</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] The National Army on the border of Hebei and Jehol, after recovering Xifengkou and Gubeikou, yesterday continued to recover Nantianmen, another important pass along the Great Wall, and continued to advance westward along Weicheng. Yesterday, they met with the troops that recovered Gubeikou. By this point, almost all the important passes of the Great Wall have been recovered, with only Malanyu remaining. The National Army has already advanced to a position 17 li north of it. The main force of the Communist army led by Li Yunchang, which was forced into the mountainous areas of Zunhua and Pinggu, is now surrounded on all sides. The various units pressing towards Zunhua and Pinggu recovered Bangjun Town and Shangcang Town south of Jixian County yesterday on the western front, and the county seat can be recovered soon. The eastern front troops were close to a position 30 li east of Zunhua last night. It is reported that the mountainous areas of Zunhua and Pinggu have been transformed by the Communist army into a strategic stronghold. Many mountain areas have been blasted into mountain caves, and a major battle is expected to take place in this area.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] The Jinzhou-Gubeikou line was fully opened when the National Army descending from Chengde recovered Gubeikou. The Jinzhou Railway Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate and prepare for restoration work. Although the Ping-Gu section has not been opened, the Pinggu District Railway Bureau has prepared materials and plans to begin surveying work on the 15th. According to railway bureau personnel, although this section is light rail, it is also standard gauge, so it will not affect future joint transportation with other railways. Furthermore, in order to prevent the National Army from resupplying, the Communist army destroyed two sections of the bridge between Zhangxin and Shunyi on the Ping-Gu line with landmines at 1:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 10th] The National Army recovered strongholds such as Langhushan and Dingjunshan in the suburbs of Jining City on the afternoon of the 10th, and a portion of the troops broke into the city.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] According to sources from relevant agencies, the National Army in eastern Sui has recovered Jining, and the siege of Datong is expected to be lifted. According to another military agency this morning, the National Army stormed into Jining at 8:00 PM yesterday, and fierce street fighting is underway in the city. All major and minor strongholds were recovered by the National Army yesterday. Another National Army unit is also increasingly approaching Fengzhen. The Jining team of the Military Mediation Department is still in the city. Yesterday, Communist Party sources said that the American representative of the Jining team, Kirk, was wounded by a bullet. However, the government received a report from Xu Kangliang, commander of the Ping Air Force, stating that the Air Force did not fire a single shot or drop a single bomb in Jining City.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] According to information from relevant agencies here, the situation in Datong continues to improve. Following the recovery of strongholds north of the city, two-thirds of the lost strongholds on the east, west, and south sides have also been recovered.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 11th] The Communist army in Zhoujiadian (5 li from the city) southwest of Datong shelled the west gate on the night of the 10th, with more than ten shells landing. Another unit attacked the south gate, resulting in two hours of fierce fighting. On the same night, the Communist army dispatched more than ten trucks from Julebao (60 li from the city) east of the city to continue supplying ammunition. Currently, the tunnel works of both sides in Wayaocun (1.5 li southwest of the city) are only 50 meters apart, facing each other.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 11th] The National Army in southern Hebei, covering local teams, broke through Zhao County on the night of the 9th and completely recovered it on the 10th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 11th] The situation in central and western Shanxi is tense. The Communist army in Fenyang, Jiexiu, Pingyao, and other counties has gathered more than 15,000 people, and there are clear signs of launching an offensive.</p>
<p>Rumors of the Communist Army Withdrawing from Harbin and Moving the Headquarters to Jiamusi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] The Northeast is generally calm, with only conflicts in the Benxi area. However, this silence is unlikely to last, and officials speculate that Lin Biao will launch an offensive to contain the westward movement of the National Army. The Communist side is also publicizing that the National Army is deploying an offensive, claiming that the New Sixth Army has been transferred south to the Liaoyang, Anshan, and Haicheng areas to take action. The 71st Army is gathering in the Liaoyuan and Faku areas, preparing to sweep the western Manchuria. The New First Army is gathering in the Changchun, Yongji, and southern bank of the Songhua River areas, actively repairing the Songhua River railway bridge, preparing to take Harbin to the north.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 11th] According to an urgent telegram published here today, the Communist army has begun a general retreat from Harbin. According to the North China Daily and the Beiping Daily, Lin Biao, the commander-in-chief of the Northeast Communist Army, who has been directing military operations in Harbin for the past few months, has begun to move his headquarters to Jiamusi, 200 miles northeast of Harbin and 75 miles southwest of the Siberian border.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Information Department held a press conference for foreign journalists at 3:00 PM on the 11th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The main questions are recorded below: Question: If the unofficial five-person group reaches an agreement on the number of seats allocated to the National Government Committee, can the government: (1) issue a nationwide ceasefire order, (2) or does the government still insist that the Chinese Communists must withdraw from northern Jiangsu?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: Not long ago, the government requested the Chinese Communists to withdraw from northern Jiangsu, the Jiaoji Railway, and other places. At that time, the Chinese Communists requested that the government be reorganized first. Now the government agrees to discuss the reorganization of the National Government Committee, and the Chinese Communists are again requesting that the above conditions be lifted first. The government is unwilling to fall into this cycle of contradictions. It is feared that merely issuing an order by the government will not achieve the results expected by the five people. For example, the government has issued orders many times, but has failed to lift the siege of Datong. If the Chinese Communists truly and sincerely cooperate with the government, I believe that conflicts can be stopped. The government does not advocate solving the Chinese Communist problem by force. What the government earnestly hopes for is the restoration of peace and order so that it can devote itself to the construction of the country as soon as possible. Once construction begins, the hungry masses controlled by the Chinese Communists will obtain employment and return to their normal lives. If they lose their tools of disturbance, they will become peaceful citizens. It does not matter if some of them still believe in Marxism or totalitarianism, as these ideas were seen in the writings of various philosophers during the Zhou and Qin dynasties 25 centuries ago, and no one in China fears these old doctrines. Question: What is the current military situation?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: There is no change in the Rugao area of northern Jiangsu. In the Suqian area, the National Army has entered east of the Grand Canal. Datong is still in the hands of the National Army. It is reported that Fu Zuoyi's reinforcement army has arrived in Fengzhen. Gubeikou has been recovered, and the Ping-Gu railway will be open to traffic soon.</p>

<h3 id="e4">A Secret Order from the Chinese Communists: Prepare for Long-Term Internal Strife <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 11th] The secret order of the Communist Party obtained by the Tonghua local authorities in Northeast China, as reported by the Central Daily News, contains five key points: (1) We should abandon various comprehensive war concepts and prepare for a long-term "defensive war"; (2) We should establish border bases with the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia to mobilize and arm peasants; (3) We should make our actions give a blow to "reactionary capitalists"; (4) Our goal is not to occupy towns but to annihilate the Kuomintang army; (5) Our power is based on peasants, and without the help of peasants, defeat is inevitable.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Under the Armed Surveillance of the Communist Side, Forcing the Team to Leave Chengde, The American Team Leader Reports on the Evacuation Process <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 11th] Colonel Rozmai, the American team leader of the 11th Executive Team of the Military Mediation Department, told reporters today: The Communist army arrested the 11th Team, forced them to leave Chengde, and traveled along the winding roads of Jehol Province under armed surveillance, during which they were strafed by National Army aircraft. When a Communist army officer ordered the team to leave Chengde, "I stated that I was departing under protest, and I believe that I have been arrested. I had no choice but to depart because I was facing force, and I was only able to depart under armed surveillance." Rozmai's report is completely different from the previous reports on the experiences of the 11th Team. Rozmai also revealed that the four Communist Party members who died in the air raid were not members of the team. Communist Party sources previously reported that the four were members of the team, which is not true. These four were a Communist army truck driver, a cook, and two soldiers. The only team member who died was Staff Sergeant Li Qingfu of the National Army. Rozmai also detailed that after the American Sergeant Hogan was burned, he tried to seek help but was blocked by the Communist army. He stated to the Communist army that he had been ordered by the Military Mediation Department to stay in Chengde, but before he could telegraph the Military Mediation Department, the Communist army forced him to evacuate with them, and "Communist armed soldiers ordered me to shut down the radio." At that time, the National Army was 40 miles from Chengde. He also submitted a written protest to the local Communist army commander, opposing the order to force the team to evacuate. In addition, Colonel Min Shiji, a member of the National Government side of the team, told reporters: "We left the city entirely under armed pressure. Communist armed personnel went to the team's office and forced us to depart. I told the Communist army that they had to issue an arrest warrant before I would leave the city, and the Communist army actually said, 'Okay, we arrest you.'" Colonel Wang Xiaotian, a member of the Communist Party side of the team, also met with reporters and said that the words of Rozmai and Min were "completely wrong." Rozmai did protest, but the Communist army asked the team to leave the city for the team's own safety. During the transition period when one army was withdrawing and another army was entering, chaos was inevitable in the city, and the Communist army was deeply concerned about the safety of the team. Rozmai recounted that the team members suffered hardships along the way from Chengde to Duolun on the border between Chahar and Jehol. He also stated that when two National Army planes strafed the team members, they could not tell them that the strafing target was the executive team. Rozmai continued: The team members were in a Communist electric truck, carrying four barrels of gasoline and hand grenades. When they were 13 miles south of Weichang, a P51 fighter plane came over the mountain peak and immediately pounced on the truck. Everyone in the car except the driver and a cook immediately jumped out. The truck was hit by machine gun bullets and exploded. At that time, the plane was only 600 feet above the ground, flying diagonally to avoid being hit by the explosion. After the team arrived in Duolun, the attitude of the Communist army completely changed, providing trucks and sending the team to Zhangjiakou on the 10th of this month.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 10th] Nanchang is currently preparing to welcome President Chiang Kai-shek. The Anti-Japanese War Victory Monument at the bridgehead of Zhongzheng Bridge has been repainted, and the archway erected at the bridgehead has been surrounded by red, blue, and white curtains. Military police are stationed all over the streets. When the special train of the reporter group from Kuling passed through Zhongzheng Road on the 10th, the residents along the road cast surprised glances, as if important officials had arrived. The "Jieshi Highway" welcoming President Chiang Kai-shek is concentrating manpower to repair it, and the once dim Lin Garden is also equipped with huge electric lights. It is widely rumored here that President Chiang Kai-shek will arrive here on the 12th, and the 130,000 residents are overjoyed.</p>

<p>Today, our newspaper's reporter took the special train of the reporter group to inspect the Nanxun Highway. Along the war-torn De'an, Zhanggongdu, and Wanjialing areas, the land along the highway for up to 200 li is left barren due to the lack of manpower and plowing cattle, making it impossible to use. The war disaster in northeastern Jiangxi can be seen in general.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Since the news of President Chiang Kai-shek's visit to Nanchang, the highway authorities have actively repaired the Nanxun Highway, and the road surface has been completely renewed. The autumn rice along the way has been harvested, and rice barns are piled up in the Xingzi, De'an, and Xinjian areas. The late rice is also thriving. However, the rural areas are still dilapidated, and wherever the reporter group's vehicles pass, the villages that have suffered from the war are still in ruins and cannot be repaired. The scenery is desolate and extremely bleak.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie left here on the 10th and will not return to Paris to attend the peace conference.

<h3 id="e18">The Government Has Not Issued an Attack Order, There Is Really No Need to Guarantee a Ceasefire, The President's Opinion Is Conveyed to Mr. Zhou by Special Envoy Marshall <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan said on the 11th that President Chiang Kai-shek has refused to give a ceasefire guarantee, but has put forward a counter-proposal that the Communist Party cannot accept. President Chiang Kai-shek's opinion was conveyed to Mr. Zhou Enlai by General Marshall on the 11th. Mr. Marshall and Mr. Zhou had a long talk on the 11th, but Ambassador Stuart did not attend, and no date was set for the next consultation afterwards. Mr. Wang said: The situation is still serious, and it has not yet been decided whether the Communist Party will refuse to participate in the five-person group talks. According to previous claims by the Communist Party, they would not participate in the five-person group unless President Chiang Kai-shek issued a ceasefire order. When asked whether the Communist Party was prepared to make concessions to salvage the situation, Mr. Wang replied with "I". As for the content of President Chiang Kai-shek's counter-proposal, Mr. Wang believes that "now is not the time to disclose it." However, according to other sources who told a United Press reporter, President Chiang Kai-shek's proposal includes two points: (1) Regarding the ceasefire guarantee: This guarantee is really unnecessary, because the government has not issued any attack order. If the Communist Party stops attacking government troops, then a ceasefire is a certain result. (2) Regarding the five demands for the Communist army to withdraw from the area: This matter can be resolved by the reorganized National Government Committee. When asked whether General Marshall had ever put forward a compromise plan in today's meeting, Mr. Wang declared: "There is no compromise to be made on the war issue." He also said: Zhou Enlai has full authority to handle peace negotiations, and the demand for a ceasefire guarantee that he put forward is fully supported by the highest authorities in Yan'an.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Zhou Enlai visited Special Envoy Marshall at 10:30 AM on the 11th, and did not leave until 2:15 PM. Afterwards, according to a spokesman for the Communist Party delegation, the main topic discussed today was still the ceasefire issue, and no guarantee was obtained. Therefore, the current situation is extremely serious. As for what measures will be taken under the so-called serious situation of the Communist Party, it is not yet known. Immediately, the reporter went to the American Embassy to meet Fu Jingbo and asked about the prospects for peace talks after Special Envoy Marshall returned to Nanjing. Fu said that as long as everyone can be patient and deal with it with a philosophical attitude, peace is always hopeful. As for the details of Mr. Zhou's meeting with Special Envoy Marshall on the 11th, Ambassador Stuart said that many issues are under discussion and it is not yet time to announce them, and there is no concrete news that can be reported. As for the proposal made by the ambassador to solve the problem politically and to form an informal five-person group meeting, it was not discussed today. According to Fu, old conditions are interpreted in new ways, but the goal is always to find a peaceful way to solve the problem. As for the question of the two sides approaching each other, it is believed that if everyone removes the heart of suspicion and replaces it with trust, they can definitely get closer. This is a belief, and if this belief is held, even if it is extremely hard, it will be done. The ambassador is a devout religious man, and Special Envoy Marshall is a world-renowned military scientist. They will promote this kind of peace with the greatest confidence. Someone then asked whether the ambassador would formulate a compromise opinion if the Communist Party insisted on solving the ceasefire issue first and the government advocated a political solution. Fu replied, "I believe it will be possible in the future." It is also said that Mr. Fu visited President Song at the Executive Yuan at 4:00 PM, while Ambassador Stuart stayed in the hall in the afternoon to discuss hall affairs and did not receive any guests. As for whether Mr. Zhou will visit the ambassador or Special Envoy Marshall again on the 12th, it is not yet known. The negotiations have reached today's stage, and it is like a snail climbing a wall, the destination is still very far away.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] In addition to receiving Zhou Enlai for a long talk of more than two hours at 10:30 AM on the 11th, Special Envoy Marshall had several phone calls with Ambassador Stuart in the afternoon and received US Navy Vice Admiral McLee at 6:00 PM for half an hour.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Establishment of Wuxi Command Post by Beijing Garrison Headquarters to Ensure Security in Southern Region and Expansion of Jurisdiction to Clear Out Scattered Bandits <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 11th] Amidst the advancing situation in Northern Jiangsu, the lurking bandits and roaming malcontent elements in the Jiangnan area are taking the opportunity to stir up trouble in our rear. For the sake of stability, the Capital Garrison Headquarters has established a command post in Wuxi, initially named the Taihu Lake Area Bandit Suppression Command. Due to new missions beyond bandit suppression in the lake area, it has been renamed the Wuxi Command Post, directly under the Garrison Headquarters. Lieutenant General Chen Daqing remains the Director, and Major General Mao Sen remains the Chief of Staff. Its jurisdiction includes the Jiangnan area, as well as Yangzhong and the Zhejiang-Anhui border area, with full authority to handle the clearing operations. The Command Post is divided into four clearing zones and joint defense zones. Commanders with excellent military knowledge and experience are appointed to each. The clearing zones are the Taihu Lake area, the Yangcheng Lake area, the Maoshan area, and the Pu-Jian area. The joint defense zones include Zhenjiang, Danyang, Wujin, and other areas. County magistrates within the jurisdiction are responsible for supervising the clearing operations.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] To strengthen security in the Capital Region, the Capital Garrison Headquarters has established twenty-seven inspection posts, stationed in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wujin, Suzhou, and other places. The request is currently awaiting approval from the Chairman. The posts are expected to be formally established by the end of this month at the latest. Furthermore, the Nanjing Municipal Government will establish a Military Affairs Section on October 1st, and units in the suburbs have been ordered to complete the organization of the populace by the 15th to ensure local security.</p>
<p>[Our Changshu Correspondence] The five-county joint defense conference of Changshu, Kunshan, Wuxi, Wujin, and Danyang has decided to establish a command post in Wuxi. The joint defense measures are as follows: Ships in the Yangtze River should be prohibited from docking on the south bank to prevent bandits from sneaking south. At the same time, reception centers should be established to provide an opportunity for repentance for those who surrender. After the meeting, County Magistrate Pan visited Wuxi to discuss joint defense matters between Wuxi and Kunshan with County Magistrate Xu. He returned to Changshu on the afternoon of the 8th to oversee defense matters.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Severe Transportation Problems; Sea, Land, and Air All Unable to Reach Full Capacity; Contentions Over Cargo Transported from Shanghai <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Local Dispatch] Transportation problems are a major obstacle to China's recovery. Shanghai was once an important entrepôt before the war, with imported goods transported to the interior. Today, Shanghai is congested with American goods, but even a year after the peace, the amount of these goods transported to the interior and major cities in North China remains minimal. Although sea, air, and rail facilities are developing, they are of little help. The stagnation of inland transportation is due to the CCP's destruction of railway lines, but the sea and air routes are not hindered. Water transport could be a major transportation route. Before the war, most inland port transport was handled by Chinese, British, and Japanese ships. The Japanese have now been overthrown, and British and other foreign ships are prohibited from carrying passengers and cargo in Chinese ports. Therefore, only Chinese ships currently handle waterway traffic. Many Chinese ships were lost or destroyed during the war, and today most ships are leased or purchased from the United States. However, these ships are absolutely insufficient to reach full transportation capacity. One can see this from the empty shelves in stores in North China. Some importers and exporters believe that more ships can be obtained from the United States to expand transportation capacity.</p>
<p>Incongruous Situations</p>
<p>Amidst these transportation inconveniences, the following incongruous situations are often found: A British ship sailed from Shanghai to Qingdao last month with a large portion of its cabin space empty. The ship could accommodate 250 passengers in its cabins and on deck, but it only had one lonely passenger. The ship was not allowed to load passengers and cargo in Chinese ports, only relief supplies. The next day, the ship sailed to Tianjin, and some uninvited Chinese passengers boarded the ship. They had no tickets and no documents. The crew told them that they could not carry passengers and asked them to go ashore, but they ignored them. Chinese police and soldiers came aboard to investigate, but they were unable to do anything. The ship finally set sail with ten free passengers. On the other hand, a Chinese ship also sailed to Qingdao at the same time. Its passenger capacity was 250, but it carried 900 passengers. According to passengers, the conditions on board were very difficult and did not meet world maritime standards. Few passengers had the opportunity to get a cabin, and 90% slept on deck, covering themselves with tarpaulins when it rained. A woman traveling to North China with two children brought her own food and a camp bed and also slept on deck. The prices in the ship's restaurant were higher than those on the Shanghai black market. According to the woman, "We were treated like coolies, so I will return to Shanghai by air."</p>
<p>Trouble with Land and Air Transport</p>
<p>Air transport itself is efficient and punctual, but after the American C-46, C-47, and C-54 aircraft were converted into passenger planes, only a portion of passengers were given priority. Ordinary passengers still had to book weeks in advance. Luggage space was limited, and official procedures were cumbersome, including filling out forms, finding guarantors, and obtaining police permits. Railway facilities, except for a few American-made streamlined trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line, often suffer from delays, so passengers often miss their luggage. Furthermore, the trains are crowded and seats are cramped. Therefore, the easiest and most profitable remedy is shipping. A businessman in Tianjin entertained a reporter in his magnificent new office, which had everything except goods. He analyzed the entire problem: "It's a simple math problem. Adding a few foreign ships, adding some efficiency, reducing some restrictions, and reducing some red tape would be enough."</p>

<h3 id="e24">Difficulties in Smooth Transportation Hinder Recovery Efforts <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The recovery of transportation is still very difficult. Air transport is managed by the Executive Yuan, but the number of seats is limited. Five hundred people in Chongqing are registered and waiting to fly to Nanjing, and two thousand people are waiting to fly to Ping. Water transport ships are designated by the Ministry of Communications, and the shipping companies are responsible for transporting goods. However, the ships are often requisitioned for military service after sailing east, or they must also transport grain when sailing east, so the number of people stranded in Chongqing is very high. In addition, land transport is coordinated by the Highway Administration, but the recent fighting in eastern Henan has partially interrupted the Longhai Railway, so the recovery situation is very serious.</p>

<p>Ambassador Hosts Farewell Banquet</p>
<p>[Reuters London Dispatch, 10th] Sir Bowers, head of the British trade delegation scheduled to depart for China next week, said at a luncheon at the Chinese Embassy today that the mission could be divided into two parts: exploratory and explanatory. After arriving in China, they will find out what the Chinese people need from Britain and discover what Chinese goods can be exported. He hoped that the results of this trip would further strengthen trade relations between China and Britain and promote friendship between the two countries. Chinese Ambassador Zheng Tianxi pointed out that there is a centuries-old history of mutual trust between China and Britain, which is a capital that cannot be estimated in gold or pounds. The British delegation's visit to China proves the British government's emphasis on Sino-British trade. Zheng believes that the difficulties caused by the war must first be overcome before satisfactory trade can be restored. He said that the development of trade should not only consider the capacity of the Chinese market but also remember mutual goodwill. He felt that the British trade delegation represented various industries that were of interest to the Chinese people and that their departure at this time was very timely.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Gang, Director of Overseas Trade of the British Government, continued to speak, emphasizing that this trade delegation represents the government, entrepreneurs, and workers. The trade delegation will stay in China for two or three months, visiting major industrial and commercial centers for investigation, and submit a report to the government after returning home.</p>

<p>[Local Dispatch] British Ambassador Sir Steven and his wife visited General Edgerton, Director of UNRRA, yesterday morning for discussions. After attending a banquet hosted by the Customs Commissioner, they participated in a scientific symposium. This afternoon, from 4:30 to 6:30 pm, the Ambassador and his wife will hold a cocktail party on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel to entertain guests from all walks of life. The British Chamber of Commerce will host a banquet in the evening. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai next week and return to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] Li Jun, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters on the 11th that regarding the British Ambassador's response to reporters in Shanghai, hoping that China would abolish visa procedures for foreign nationals traveling and moving within the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already received notes from the envoys of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries suggesting this, and had consulted with the Ministry of Interior on May 29th of this year. They decided in principle to open up, adopting only entry and exit visas for foreign officials coming to China, and retaining the inland visa procedures for ordinary expatriates (merchants and travelers). This is because the special situation caused by China's War of Resistance has not yet been completely eliminated, and it is necessary for the safety of expatriates and the country. This case has recently been co-signed by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, and National Defense and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Wu Jingxiong Delivers Speech: China and Vatican Both Seek Peace, Believes Foundation for Cooperation Can Be Enhanced <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[Local Dispatch] Dr. Wu Jingxiong, China's newly appointed Minister to the Holy See, told reporters at his residence yesterday that the Vatican is an organization that transcends political blocs. Its entire system is based on social justice, originating from "benevolence," so it vigorously opposes aggression and advocates for peace. China is also a peace-loving country, and the spiritual connection between them is very close. There are currently 400 million Catholics in the world, and China's population is exactly the same. Their strength in promoting future world peace is very strong. China advocates building the country with the "kingly way," and the Pope advocates replacing struggle with coordination in the reconstruction of social order. Their views coincide, and he believes that the foundation for cooperation will be further enhanced in the future. After China won its final victory after eight years of resistance, the Pope praised Chairman Chiang's wise leadership, calling him "the savior of China" (Generalissimo is a savior of China). After the victory, he especially hopes to complete the great task of national construction under peaceful unification as soon as possible. Wu continued, "Minister Xie Shoukang has worked hard for many years to connect China with the Vatican and has established good diplomatic relations. Recently, Xie was awarded the Grand Cross Medal by the Vatican, which shows that the Pope attaches great importance to him. I feel that I am thin on talent and fresh on ability, but I will only follow Chairman Chiang's instructions and continue to work on the diplomatic relations between China and the Vatican in the past to seek enhancement." When reporters asked for his opinion on the domestic situation, Wu said, "As long as 400 million people are of one mind and one heart, and work hard to build the country under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, all problems can be solved, because Chairman Chiang is the most democratic leader, and his open-mindedness is something that ordinary people cannot imagine." When reporters asked about his departure date, he said, "I will decide after visiting Chairman Chiang."</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 11th] The Zhejiang Provincial Assembly held its seventh meeting today, listening to reports from the Accounting Office, the Military Control Area Command, and the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Administration. Assemblymen severely criticized the salt administration, saying that the Salt Affairs Bureau is unwilling to develop the effectiveness of salt and only limits its production, putting the cart before the horse, which is a backward policy. In addition, Tian Xiushan, who robbed, killed, and burned in Ningbo, Cixi, Shangyu, Yuyao, Zhuji, and other counties during the War of Resistance and was hated by the people, was arrested after the victory for recruiting former subordinates and attempting to rebel, but the case is still pending. Thirteen assemblymen have jointly proposed that the Assembly forward the case to the responsible authorities for prompt and severe punishment according to the law, to uphold national law and appease public anger.</p>

<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch, 10th] According to informed sources, the procedures for shipping goods to China in the first quarter of 1947, as planned by the UNRRA Central Committee in July last year, should be decided by the end of September, but as of now, UNRRA has not prepared to formulate these procedures. It is said that due to the seamen's strike and the resignation of several important UNRRA officials due to the upcoming end of affairs in Europe, the internal situation of the General Office is extremely chaotic. It is believed that UNRRA will not make any statements on the issue of China's relief program for 1947 until the end of this month. At the same time, a Chinese official expressed pessimism about the amount of relief supplies that China could obtain in the spring of 1947, because the reserve funds that UNRRA could use would be dwindling.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Wu Ching-hsiung, Legal Genius <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Special Compilation by the Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>Wu Ching-hsiung was often referred to as a genius in Chinese legal circles. At the age of twenty-six, he became a renowned professor at the Soochow University Law School, and his book "Jurisprudence" was adopted as a textbook in many universities in the United States. At twenty-eight, he became the youngest, yet most prominent, judge in the newly recovered Provisional Court of Shanghai. He was one of the leading experts in the Legislative Yuan and the drafter of the first constitution of the Republic of China, the "May 5th Draft Constitution."</p>
<p>Behind a pair of tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses lay a pair of deep, scholarly eyes. His lips were often tightly closed, revealing his will and wisdom. This legal scholar, who is not yet fifty years old this year, was recently appointed as our country's envoy to the Vatican. Since the Pope elevated Tian Gengxin to Cardinal not long ago, the relationship between the Vatican and China has become increasingly close. However, the relationship between the church and the state is not only diplomatic but also religious and cultural. Wu Ching-hsiung is naturally the most suitable person to choose as such an envoy.</p>
<p>He has a glorious early history. At the age of twenty-two, he graduated with first-class honors from the then prestigious Soochow University Law School. At the age of twenty-three, he obtained a doctorate in law from the University of Michigan in the United States. Because of his outstanding academic performance, he was sent to France to study at the University of Paris. The following year, he went to the University of Berlin in Germany for research. At the age of twenty-six, he became a renowned professor at the Soochow University Law School.</p>
<p>At that time, Ding Wenjiang and Xu Weizhen were handling the recovery of the Provisional Court. Wu published an article in a magazine, putting forward his opinions on the Provisional Court. Xu read it and greatly admired him, so he appointed him as one of the judges of the Civil Court. Xu was the president of the Provisional Court at that time, but the two of them had never met before. On the day of the establishment, Wu took office and went to see the president. When the two met, they had to ask each other's name first, which made everyone laugh.</p>
<p>Wu later rose to become the president of the Provisional Court. In 1929, he was invited by Harvard University to go to the United States to lecture. This young president, who was only thirty-one years old, looked like a young man just out of school. Before leaving the country, he went to the Dollar Steamship Company to book a cabin and signed John C. H. wu in the name column. The foreigner in the steamship company looked him up and down and asked, "So you are the son of President Wu of the Provisional Court, going to the United States to study?"</p>
<p>In 1933, Wu was invited by President Sun Ke to serve as a member of the Legislative Yuan. Since then, he has been participating in the country's legislative work. His greatest contribution is naturally the drafting of the "May 5th Draft Constitution." This constitution was drafted based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of the separation of five powers and with reference to the characteristics of the constitutions of European and American countries. Some amendments were proposed in the Political Consultative Conference, but undoubtedly, this is still the only blueprint for the Constitution of China. Wu is extremely accomplished in English. Before the war, he ran a large-scale English publication "T'ien Hsia Monthly" in Shanghai. In one issue, he wrote an article comparing the artistic conception in Tang poetry with the poetry of 19th-century England. His beautiful writing made everyone see that he was a person with extremely high attainments in English literature.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I heard people in Chongqing say that Wu was instructed by Chairman Chiang to translate the Bible with reference to English, French, and Latin. He began writing on November 1, 1942, and completed the manuscript on October 31, 1944. Among them, the twenty-seven books of the New Testament and one book of Psalms were personally reviewed and revised by Chairman Chiang. "The Translation of the Psalms" will be published by the Commercial Press within the month. This is really the beginning of translating the classics in Chinese classical Chinese, and it is an immortal contribution to culture and religion.</p>

<h3 id="e47">How Will the Municipal Council Proceed in the Future? <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The first meeting of the first Shanghai Municipal Council has been going on for three days as of yesterday, with six general meetings held. Although it seems very lively in the newspapers, it is generally still in the stage of reports and inquiries, and has not yet discussed proposals that are truly related to the welfare and burden of the citizens. The three or four million citizens are watching the future direction of the council with "ten thousand eyes staring," not just ten eyes seeing and ten fingers pointing. Councilors, you were very enthusiastic during the election, and you should think about why you wanted to run for election when you attend the meeting. If the first meeting of the council cannot come up with several proposals that are hoped for by the public, how will it face the citizens?</p>
<p>According to the general impression of reporters over the past three days, the council hall began to gradually feel like a "parliament" yesterday. In the previous two days, it seemed a little too polite and a little too solemn. We are not suggesting that ink boxes must fly and tables must be slapped in the council hall, but the council hall is not just a place for everyone to congratulate, compliment, and exchange greetings. The tension of inquiries and replies, and the debates of support and opposition, as seen yesterday, can show that the demeanor and spirit of democratic politics will be cultivated and successful in these scenes. We have long pointed out that the biggest task of the Municipal Council this time is to establish a model of a Chinese local council in Shanghai, this international metropolis. To achieve this goal, the Municipal Council must not be afraid of "publicity" and "debate," seek the truth and never violate the regulations, not obliterate minority opinions and still obey the decisions of the majority, and be able to argue red-faced in the meeting hall and shake hands and laugh as if nothing had happened after the meeting. Only in this way can it be like a council, and only in this way can China join the ranks of democratic countries. If councilors, like some people who advocate democracy, leave the meeting in a huff once their opinions are not passed, they will never see democracy.</p>
<p>Secondly, "no taxation without representation" is the earliest golden rule of British democratic constitutionalism. Therefore, the most important responsibility of the Municipal Council is to pass the municipal budget and review the municipal final accounts. We believe that it is better for the Municipal Council to meticulously and realistically pass a reasonable budget based on the future direction of municipal facilities than to decide on hundreds of trivial decorative proposals. The budget can not only show the income and expenditure of municipal finance but can also serve as a guide for all government administration. Only matters stipulated in the budget can be handled; those deleted should not be handled. The final accounts and the previous revenue and expenditure estimates can show whether the government's work for the citizens is legal in terms of revenue and wasteful in terms of expenditure. It should be known that every penny of government expenditure is a drop of fat and blood of the citizens. The draft general budget for the second half of this year has been submitted to the Municipal Council; this is the only major case. According to the explanation, the income and expenditure are insufficient, and an additional 33.327 billion yuan in new donations and taxes must be listed to cope with the expenditure. We still do not know what new donations and taxes the government will add, or whether these donations and taxes will be borne equally by every citizen, or heavily taxed on those who made fortunes during the national crisis, made victory fortunes, and received property. In particular, we do not know what municipal facilities will be used to benefit the citizens after the new donations and taxes are added. Therefore, we can only reserve criticism at this time; but the council should be clear about the importance of its responsibility when examining and discussing this major case. Have the government's administrative guidelines and work plans been clarified? Has the Municipal Council passed these guidelines and plans first? Have the past revenue and expenditure estimates and expenditure final accounts been reviewed? Do the councilors have materials for reference on the budget final accounts of the former two concession-era public works bureaus and the pre-war government budget final accounts? Have the councilors widely solicited opinions on what municipal affairs the general public urgently expects the government to handle? All of these are important keys to discussing the budget. There are many social elites, accounting experts, and representatives from the people in the council, and it is expected that they will not fail the expectations of millions of citizens.</p>
<p>A New Page in the Relationship Between Our Country and the Vatican</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan passed a resolution at its 758th meeting the other day to appoint Wu Ching-hsiung as the envoy to the Vatican. This is a new page in the diplomatic relationship between our country and the Vatican. It is noted that the establishment of diplomatic relations between our country and the Vatican coincided with the emergency of the international situation after the Pearl Harbor incident and was a major achievement of our wartime diplomacy. In the spring of 1942, our government appointed Xie Shoukang as our first envoy to the Vatican. After Xie took office, he made many contributions to promoting the relationship between our country and the Vatican, and finally, during his tenure, the first cardinal of Chinese nationality was appointed, and the church system in China was established. At that time, due to wartime relations, the Vatican was unable to send diplomatic envoys to China; now the Vatican has appointed its first envoy to China, and our country is also sending a legal scholar of international renown to the Vatican at this time. Thus, our country and the Vatican have established normal diplomatic relations. Wu, as a Catholic and an internationally renowned legal scholar, will be able to perform his duties satisfactorily.</p>
<p>The Vatican City is a small place, but envoys from all countries gather there; even in the United States, President Truman has a personal representative, Ambassador Taylor, stationed there. This is because the Pope is the highest moral authority in the world, and the spiritual love of 400 million Catholics around the world is entrusted to him. All his words and deeds are enough to affect the overall situation of the world. Today's world is in the aftermath of a great war, and the reconstruction of the post-war order lies in ensuring lasting peace. The Pope, as the highest moral authority, can have a direct or indirect impact on the reconstruction of world peace. Our government's appointment of our country's top scholar as envoy to the Vatican shows how much the government values the relationship between our country and the Vatican.</p>
<p>Since Catholicism was reintroduced to China during the late Ming Dynasty, it has made great contributions to promoting the exchange of Chinese and Western cultures. In modern times, the number of believers has exceeded four million, and priests are all over the country. Although the percentage of the total population is not high, it is still an important force. The doctrines it upholds encompass Confucianism and Taoism and are very close to the principles of self-cultivation and family management. Its spirit of dealing with the world emphasizes perseverance and simplicity, which is in line with the "practical and solid" advocated by our Chairman. Now the country is in the process of building a nation, and the most important thing in building a nation is the establishment of moral order, which our Chairman has repeatedly emphasized at all costs. Since our government attaches great importance to the relationship between our country and the Vatican, we hope that Catholics across the country can understand the government's good intentions, put the spirit of Catholic doctrines into practice, and establish a new atmosphere for the country. To reverse the current immoral trend of "rampant human desires," we need the infusion of the Catholic spirit. The nation and the country have high hopes for Catholics. May Catholics do well!</p>
<p>Pan-Asian Conference</p>
<p>According to a report by Agence France-Presse from New Delhi, India, Prime Minister Nehru of the Indian Interim Government will invite Asian countries to hold a Pan-Asian Conference in India next year. The transmission of this news is quite abrupt. Since we have not yet received official confirmation, we do not want to comment on the convening of the Pan-Asian Conference in India. However, since the name of the Pan-Asian Conference has been put forward, we would like to express some opinions here.</p>
<p>In principle, if this regional Pan-Asian Conference follows the example of the Pan-American Conference and does not conflict with the United Nations' institutions, it may make a great contribution to the maintenance of security and order, and we can naturally agree with it. However, the convening of the Pan-American Conference has historical and other relationships existing between them; the situation in Asia and the Americas does not seem to be the same. If we want to follow the old rules of the Pan-American Conference, it seems that it will take a lot of discussion between the initiators and the hosts. Furthermore, the so-called Pan-Asian Conference may also take a posture similar to the so-called Pan-Arab, or it may be a people's conference without the participation of government representatives.</p>
<p>But no matter what form it takes, from a practical political point of view, it is questionable whether the convening of the so-called Pan-Asian Conference at this time is a wise move. Judging from the existing signs, the time for the convening of this Pan-Asian Conference at this time is not yet ripe. Most of the people in Asia have just been liberated from the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" advocated by the Japanese warlords. They have suffered deeply, both spiritually and physically, from the "Pan-Asian" doctrine that has been poisoned. Although this is Japanese-style "Pan-Asian" doctrine, since the "Pan-Asian" tune has been trampled by the Japanese warlords for a while, we must first do some purification work. Otherwise, if we inadvertently repeat the old tune, it will only evoke painful memories for the people. Furthermore, given the current international situation, the convening of this Pan-Asian Conference is likely to be sacrificed as a "sacrifice." From the standpoint of the Chinese people, the convening of the Pan-Asian Conference at this time is still under consideration. Therefore, we believe that a person as intelligent and talented as Nehru should still consider this relatively major issue.</p>

<h3 id="e48">White House Convenes Military Leaders' Conference to Discuss Unified Command of the Three Armed Forces: Prelude to the US Government's Military Reorganization <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, President Truman held a meeting at the White House last night with Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower, and Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz, which is a sign of the unified command of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force. It is heard that the President intends to stipulate a formula to eliminate friction among the commanders of various departments. Regarding this matter, the President will sign two decrees. The first decree stipulates the establishment of a unified National Defense Committee, with the President as the chairman. The second decree stipulates the establishment of a committee to protect the nation's important resources and raw materials that can be used for combat. This committee will ensure that the nation's war capabilities are expanded to the maximum extent. According to the first decree, before the complete unified command of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the supreme commanders of each department should maintain considerable independence. As for the National Resources Committee, it will be responsible for implementing the President's recent order regarding the ten-year resource storage plan. This plan stipulates that the US will purchase essential national defense raw materials that it currently lacks from the world market at a cost of 4 billion US dollars over the next ten years. At the same time, British Chief of Staff Montgomery will come to the US from Canada for a visit. The US decision on unified command will inevitably have an impact on British military affairs.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jackson, Mississippi, 10th Dispatch] US Senator Eastland issued a warning today, stating that unless our country stops all forms of appeasement and adopts an open and strong diplomatic policy, war with the Soviet Union cannot be avoided. He said that although there is no immediate danger of war with the Soviet Union at present, the Soviet Union's plan to support communism throughout the world is becoming increasingly clear.</p>
<p>The United States is Determined to Break the Soviet Line</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch] The US State Department once resolved to break the Soviet line. The following is part of the reason, from which we can see the crux of the US-Soviet dispute: (1) The Atlantic Charter has been recognized by the Soviet Union, which does not stipulate giving territory to any country, but the Soviet Union has acquired the Karelian Isthmus from Finland, Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina from Romania, and slightly acquired the land east of Poland, and acquired Ruthenia from Czechoslovakia. Poland and Czechoslovakia are both United Nations countries, but the Soviet Union has not taken them into consideration. With the exception of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States have not acquired land from other countries.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th Dispatch] Recent developments in Europe and other places have increased the amount of war talk in Washington, and hardly a day goes by without some columnists issuing warnings about a "second Pearl Harbor" or a "pincer attack" on Alaska. However, according to the opinions of American women leaders, all rumors about war are the natural result of mutual suspicion and fear. According to Ms. Dickinson, president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, who recently returned from the Soviet Union, Soviet people admit that only friendship and goodwill towards the American people can avoid war. Although Ms. Dickinson does not like the Soviet way of life at all, she believes that there is no reason why the US and the Soviet Union cannot get along in a friendly manner.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 10th Dispatch] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie recently suggested to the Economic and Social Council that a temporary committee be established to draft a set of regulations that clearly stipulate the legal status of international refugee relief agencies. If this suggestion is passed, the temporary committee will be established immediately.

<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 10th Dispatch] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky declared today in the Security Council that the Council should immediately eliminate the threat to peace posed by Greek policy.

The South African representative took a surprising action, announcing the abandonment of South Africa's demands for reparations from Italy. It is said that Italy made many contributions and significant sacrifices after joining the Allied forces and should be consoled. Also, France today submitted a document to the committee, pointing out that Italian troops had caused significant losses in France, valued at 23.5 billion US dollars, but formal reparation demands have not yet been made. In addition, Norway is demanding 20 million yuan in reparations from Italy, Egypt is demanding 10 million pounds, Mexico is demanding 5.4 million yuan and 43 million lire, and Iraq is demanding 1.6 million dinars (Iraqi currency).</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Paris, 10th] The Romanian Political Committee today unanimously approved the plan of the four foreign ministers, allowing Soviet troops to remain in Romania for a period equal to the Soviet occupation period in Austria. The committee disregarded the Soviet Union's fierce opposition and passed, by a vote of seven to five, the British proposal that Romania should especially respect the property and interests of Jews within its borders. The British proposal did not specifically name Jews, but only suggested that the property of foreigners in Romania should be respected regardless of race, gender, language, or religion.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 11th (Broadcast): The Palestine problem conference continued in London today. The Arab representative delivered an important speech, saying, "Palestine should belong to the Arabs. Palestine has no connection with the Jews. The Jewish problem is a very broad issue in the world and requires multi-faceted cooperation to be resolved." The representatives then held secret talks. The public meeting will continue tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] On the first day of the Palestine conference, Prime Minister Attlee and Colonial Secretary Hall still personally attended. Syrian representative al-Khouri spoke on the spot, strongly arguing against allowing the land of Palestine to be used as a residence for other ethnic groups. The Arab countries firmly oppose the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. Al-Khouri's words were the Arab countries' formal response to the opening speech made by Attlee. The representatives unanimously opposed the partition plan, which is completely contrary to the position of Kutscher of the Jewish Agency. Therefore, the possibility that the British and Arab representatives would discuss the partition plan in the meeting so that the Jewish representatives could attend later seems to have been completely eliminated.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Kutscher, the US representative of the Jewish Agency, said today that the Jewish Agency's failure to participate in the first meeting of the London Conference was a matter of principle, not a tactic. When I met Foreign Secretary Bevin in Paris, I asked him to hold private negotiations with the Jewish and Arab groups as preparation for the London Conference, but Bevin refused. The Jewish Agency believes that being willing to discuss the partition plan is a major concession on our part. The Arab representatives did not make concessions but attended the meeting with an uncompromising plan.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Undersecretary of State Clayton said to reporters today that regarding the two incidents of Yugoslavia shooting down US planes, Yugoslavia has temporarily agreed to provide compensation for the loss of life of the five pilots, but it still refuses to compensate for the loss of the planes.

Clayton did not announce the amount of compensation requested by the United States. According to diplomatic circles, it is less than 400,000 US dollars. Clayton also reiterated the State Department's statement that the government does not intend to prevent the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration from transporting relief supplies to Yugoslavia because of the plane incidents.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Paris, 11th (Broadcast from New York): The New York port seamen's strike, which lasted nearly a week, has resumed work with the intervention of New York Mayor O'Dwyer. It is reported that the New York mayor has promised to support the union's insistence that the Wage Stabilization Board should withdraw its order.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, New York, 10th] American shipping workers have been on strike for five days, and there is still no sign of a resolution. This strike has paralyzed American maritime commerce and seriously disrupted domestic shipping. The New York freight workers' strike, which has lasted a week, also has a distant resolution date, and countless residents of New York are bound to feel a shortage of food. The hope of ending the national shipping strike rests on the meeting held by the Wage Stabilization Board on the 10th. The heads of the unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor insist that the strike can be ended only if the Wage Stabilization Board withdraws its previous resolution. However, the situation today is serious and complex. Twenty-five thousand Valley freight workers are also on strike. Unless their wage demands are met, they will block all freight to New York City. The freight workers' strike has also affected newspapers in various places, as newspaper offices feel a shortage of paper. All morning newspapers have therefore suspended publication, except for the Daily News, because it has a large supply of paper. Labor leaders feel that workers are being squeezed by rising prices and short wages and believe that rising prices must be stopped to avoid a spreading strike.</p>

<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 10th] The Japanese Seamen's Union issued a strike order yesterday, and the long-brewing general strike of Japanese seamen has finally been realized. As of August 1, the total number of Japanese ships was 625, with a total tonnage of 1,068,693 tons. Among them, 564 ships are currently sailing, including those repatriating Japanese prisoners of war, totaling 960,057 tons. The total number of Japanese seamen is about 86,000, and members of the Seamen's Union account for about 70%, or 54,000 people. It is difficult to predict the number of ships currently on strike nationwide, but it is estimated that those belonging to the Ship Allocation Association reach about 67,000 tons.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Colonel Wilde, a British officer who was once captured by the Japanese, testified in the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal this morning, describing the Japanese army's massacre of overseas Chinese and mistreatment of prisoners of war in Singapore. It is said that on February 22, 1942, I went to see Japanese Lieutenant Colonel Sugita to protest that the Japanese army often shot more than 100 overseas Chinese without cause and forced British prisoners to bury them. Sugita replied that the overseas Chinese who were killed were all bad people and that bad people would be executed at any time and anywhere. I investigated that at least 8,000 or more overseas Chinese were killed by the Japanese army in one year. Although the Japanese army declared that it would always protect the safety of non-combatants, it did not fulfill it in fact. He also described the tragic massacre when Japanese infantry rushed into the Alexandra military hospital in Singapore on February 13, 1942. It is said that the Japanese army rampaged through the hospital, killing everyone they met, and even patients and doctors who were undergoing surgery were not spared. Many people wearing Red Cross badges were also stabbed or shot. A total of 20 medical officers, 60 patrolmen, and 20 recovered soldiers died. The witness said that a Japanese officer shot the Red Cross flag on the roof of the hospital with a gun, and several Japanese soldiers ordered the wounded on the sickbeds to stand up and shoot or stab them. Wilde continued to describe the inhuman life of the 50,000 prisoners of war in the Singapore concentration camp and the Japanese army's insults and abuse of them. All Allied officers and soldiers, regardless of rank, had to salute even the lowest-ranking Japanese soldiers.</p>

<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 11th] As of the 9th, the amount of Japanese banknotes issued had reached 60.1711 million yen. It is believed that the highest record of the old banknote issuance amount of 61.8 billion yen will be broken around the 20th of this month. In the future, due to the reconstruction of the new price system, the implementation of this year's budget, and the release of reconstruction financial funds, inflation will increase. Although there is the collection of property tax, it is expected to approach the 100 billion yen mark by the end of this year.</p>

<h3 id="e71">The Senate Held the Fifth and Sixth Meetings Yesterday; Review of Proposals Begins Today; Senators Question Senior Officials of the Land Administration Bureau for Dereliction of Duty and Corruption, Creating a Heated and Tense Atmosphere Throughout the Meeting <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The fifth and sixth meetings of the City Senate were held yesterday in the morning and afternoon, respectively. The meeting began at 9:15 am, with 150 senators present and 10 people in attendance. As of yesterday, the secretariat had received a total of 352 proposals and 5 motions from the mayor. In the morning, Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, reported on the general situation of policy implementation. Subsequently, the Speaker proposed inquiry methods. In addition to written inquiries, verbal inquiries should first be written on a slip and submitted to the Speaker, and inquiries should be made in the order of the number reported from the speaker's platform, with a focus on general inquiries. Eight senators raised questions to Director Zhu, among which the case of dereliction of duty and corruption of senior officials of the Land Administration Bureau raised by Tao Baichuan created the most tense atmosphere. The assembly then discussed the issue of appointing representatives to participate in the investigation team again. Although opinions were divided and the discussion was heated, it was finally resolved to make a decision after the head of the team, Zhang Zhiben, returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Director Gu of the Finance Bureau reported on financial policy implementation. After Director Gu's report, Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau responded to the verbal inquiries raised by the senators the day before. At 4:00 pm, Speaker Pan temporarily excused himself to attend the weekend symposium for scientists to entertain British Ambassador Stevenson, and Deputy Speaker Xu Jichang took his place. After Director Zhang finished answering, nine senators raised verbal inquiries to the Finance Bureau, which Director Gu answered one by one. Subsequently, the Speaker reported the location of today's review committee meeting, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 pm.</p>
<p>Today, the General Assembly will hold the first and second review meetings in three separate locations by ten review committees.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Zhu Ping Reports on Land Administration: More Than 80,000 Land Registrations; Urges Implementation of Land Policy <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, reported on the city's land administration work, especially emphasizing the relationship between land administration work and local autonomy, repeatedly citing Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament. He said: Regarding land administration work, on the one hand, it is political because the elements of a country are land, people, and sovereignty. On the other hand, it is also economic, because land, labor, and capital are indispensable for production, so land administration work is extremely complicated.</p>
<p>Land administration work is closely related to local autonomy work. "Autonomy must begin with land administration." The Outline of National Reconstruction states: To implement land administration, land value tax must be levied. The economic strength of local autonomy can rely on income from land administration. Currently, land tax and land survey are being actively carried out, and the rice will be used for autonomous funding. The current central tasks are land consolidation, land registration, land liquidation, land value assessment, and implementation of land value tax. The work in the past three months is briefly reported as follows:</p>
<p>Land registration is quite complicated. The processing principles are divided into four points: 1. Simplify procedures. 2. Shorten the time. 3. Reduce fees. 4. Severely punish extortion. Some of the above points have been completed. For example, title deeds can be used for financial circulation. However, registration review must involve verification of the title deed. However, delivering it to the Land Administration Bureau hinders turnover, so most landowners are unwilling to register. To reduce difficulties, a photo system was adopted. When verifying the title deed, submit two photos in addition to the original document. The original certificate is returned first, and the photos are retained. Regarding transfer registration, as long as the new registration is completed, it can be completed within one day. Registration fees have also been suspended, but land registration procedures are indeed too complicated, and things are also too complex. In the past, the French Concession handled land registration from 1910, but it was not completed until before the war. The former Public Concession took even longer. The Shanghai Municipal Government only handled more than 160,000 land registrations from 1927 to 1937. As for the land applied for in the past three months, there are more than 80,000 pieces, and more than 500 pieces have been completed.</p>
<p>In the Concession era, foreigners were given title deeds when they bought land. However, for some title deeds, although the household name is a foreigner, the property rights have long belonged to Chinese people, and in the past, Chinese people often bought land in the name of foreigners. After the victory, when sorting out title deeds, foreigners said that the household name was a foreigner and should belong to foreigners. This matter has a great impact on our country's sovereignty. After Mayor Wu's many compromises, a solution was reached. All property rights of countries whose names are Chinese belong to Chinese people.</p>
<p>Public Land Clearance The city's public land is very chaotic because there have been many changes during the concession and puppet organization era. Now all the files and archives of public land have been collected completely. The current problem is how to clear it and how to take it over. 民應應應　　　　應應。It is reasonable to return the land requisitioned from the people by the enemy and puppets, but it is very difficult because some of it has been used for national defense, such as airports. Farmland should have been returned earlier, but it is also difficult because some of it was taken over by the central government. Regarding the issue of the demarcation of provincial and municipal boundaries, the boundaries of this city were decided by the central government in 1927. Currently, it has not been completely taken over because the Soviet government has not agreed. The central government must send personnel to negotiate. Regarding land value tax, we are actively preparing, and the central government ordered that it must be implemented this year.</p>
<p>There are two principles for the housing shortage problem: 1. Deal with the current situation and strengthen lease management. 2. Encourage construction. New houses are exempt from land value tax for two years and house donation for one year, and rent is not restricted.</p>
<p>Finally, report on the land policy. After Wallace came to China to investigate, he believed that the prerequisite for China's industrialization was to implement land reform, and the tiller must have his own land. Stuart also said: To achieve China's peaceful reunification, land reform must be implemented. In fact, this was said by Sun Yat-sen decades ago, and now is the urgent stage where it must be done. Although Shanghai is a commercial and industrial area, it also has more than one million acres of farmland. Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the country. To implement the country's most important facilities, it still needs to start in Shanghai. As long as all the virtuous senators have the determination, if there is a decision on this, we have a way in administrative technology, and any difficulties are not worth mentioning.</p>

<h3 id="e74">The Question of Whether to Participate in the Investigation Team: A FierCE Debate Ensues, Opinions Among Councilors Differ, Original Proposal Retained <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the question of whether the Municipal Council should send representatives to participate in the investigation team, a lively debate arose the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning, after the Director of the Land Bureau finished answering inquiries, Speaker Pan announced the continuation of the discussion on this issue. Councilors spoke enthusiastically and passionately. Some advocated for participation, some opposed it, some advocated for conditional participation, some advocated for forming a separate receiving investigation team, and some advocated for inviting the investigation team to the assembly to report before deciding on a stance. However, in the end, it was decided to temporarily retain the case, and the Speaker would cable Zhang, the head of the team, to return to Shanghai within three days to clarify everything before further discussion.</p>
<p>Before discussing the main topic, the Secretary-General reported the results of inquiries to the investigation team on two points: First, the investigation team's work in Shanghai would last a total of fifty days, from July 24th to September 13th. Extending the investigation time would probably be impossible. Second, the participation of council members would only be of an assisting nature, and the number of people could not be increased.</p>
<p>After the report, Feng Youzhen took the stage to speak. He said, "This issue needs to be considered calmly. Regarding the council forming its own investigation team, I am afraid it is inappropriate, because the council is a legislative body, not a supervisory body. In fact, it cannot independently carry out the investigation and receipt of materials, because it is not within its scope of authority. Speaking of refusing to participate, it may be unavoidable to disappoint the more than four million citizens of Shanghai. The Municipal Council originally represents the more than four million citizens, and what the citizens are most dissatisfied with is the receiving work, so the Municipal Council should investigate whenever it has the opportunity, doing its duty for one day. Otherwise, the citizens will say that the council is abandoning its responsibility. But after participating, it is to actively investigate, with the council announcing to the citizens and asking them to assist in reporting. Secondly, after participating, the council should still maintain its independent status. Moreover, three representatives should be sent: one lawyer, one accountant, and one from the press." Feng also nominated Zhan Wenhu as the press representative.</p>
<p>After that, Ma Junshuo expressed his opinion: "The investigation team is organized by the central government, and local groups cannot change it, and it will end on September 13th. Therefore, we will form another Shanghai District Receiving Committee to contact the public and implement a long-term and thorough investigation. This committee is of a voluntary nature, with one director and eleven members, from whom one person will be selected to participate in the investigation team, becoming a bridge between the people and the investigation team." At this time, Speaker Pan issued a statement saying: "What is being discussed now is the question of whether to participate or not. As for the organization of an investigation committee, that is another matter, and will not be discussed for the time being."</p>
<p>Others who spoke in favor of participation included Wang Jian'e. He said, "Because the government does not trust the dispatched officials, it organized the investigation team. We should participate and supervise the investigation team. However, in addition to participating, we should also set up another organization." Zhu Taiyao also favored participation. He said, "The steps for participation should be considered. First, we must understand the past work of the investigation team, and at the same time, we must extend the investigation time."</p>
<p>Huang Zhensheng said, "Since the investigation team has sent a letter inviting us, whether to participate or not is up to the assembly to decide. Shanghai has the most materials received from the occupied areas, and what has been received is all the people's hard-earned money. The investigation team should report to the assembly on its achievements in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Lu Shidao opposed participation. He said, "We cannot be decorative pieces. Participating is a waste of time and will not yield any results. Moreover, in fact, the investigation team will end on the 13th, which is only forty-eight hours away. What can be investigated in these forty-eight hours? The citizens deeply hate the corruption in the receiving process. They hope for a clear and complete result, so we must set up another investigation agency."</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan, who first expressed opposition and expressed explosive opinions, said, "I personally did not participate in the work of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, so I oppose participation, not for personal convenience. However, councilors present who have participated in the work of the management bureau should recuse themselves when discussing this issue. In addition, the investigation team officially started the investigation work on August 11th, and they should have notified us when this assembly was formally established on August 13th. Now they have gone to Hangzhou, and the work is about to end, and then they come to notify us, which seems to be completely insincere. Although we do not have a legal basis to form our own investigation team, others do not have a legal basis to oppose our organization."</p>
<p>At this time, Lu Yinchu moved to stop the discussion, which was passed without objection. However, before the vote, Zhang Zhihan proposed: "It may be better to temporarily retain this case, and the Speaker should cable Zhang, the head of the team, to return to Shanghai within three days to clarify everything before putting it to a vote, because it is not yet known whether the investigation team will definitely end in forty-eight hours."</p>
<p>The result of the vote was passed with one hundred votes.</p>
<p>According to a certain councilor's prediction: in the future, those who support participation may be in the majority. What will happen in the end, let's wait and see!</p>

<h3 id="e75">Hospitals Only Ask for Money When Admitting Patients: Ways to Improve Include Increasing Beds and Promoting Medical Ethics: Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei Responds to Councilors' Inquiries <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei verbally responded to the inquiries of councilors the day before yesterday as follows: (1) In addition to the 150 million yuan for the epidemic prevention department, an additional budget of 400 million yuan has been added, and over 200 million yuan has already been received and spent. Some people have criticized the epidemic prevention work in the suburbs as not being diligent enough, but because epidemic prevention is an urgent measure, it is based on pathology, with a distinction between what is important and what is not. In addition, insufficient manpower is also a fact. Fundamentally, the issue of permanent epidemic prevention work is still a matter of insufficient funding. Regarding the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases, we are currently in contact with the Executive Yuan to establish an express treatment center to treat them with penicillin. In addition, we plan to establish vaccination stations. (2) Regarding environmental sanitation, the main difficulty in clearing garbage is the lack of tools. We have now purchased 40 trucks from the Executive Yuan, but it is still not enough. Regarding the issue of contracting out the removal of night soil, in principle, it is of course better to do it ourselves. This matter is still under consideration. There are problems with requisitioning land for the construction of public toilets. Only two have been built so far. Of the total budget of 100 million yuan, 50 million yuan has been allocated in advance to build 150 night soil carts. Regarding pharmaceutical management, we will try our best to increase the number of beds, increase the number of free and semi-free places, and vigorously rectify the tendency of some hospitals to only ask for money when admitting patients, and strive to promote medical ethics. Zhang finally declared: The Health Bureau will start compiling statistics on births, deaths, and causes of death from January 1st next year.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Each Committee of Review to Begin Reviewing Proposals Today <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The Municipal Council will hold meetings of each committee of review for proposals today. The council specially hosted a banquet yesterday at 6:00 PM at the Yiyuan to invite the conveners of the ten committees and the secretaries of each committee to discuss relevant review matters. As suggested by Councilor Zhao Dihua, the majority passed a motion to have the Ninth Committee review the municipal budget and final accounts, and the Tenth Committee review proposals and policy reports related to finance and land. It is also proposed to first discuss the five motions submitted by the mayor (all related to finance, taxation, etc.). Zhou Feicheng, the convener of the Sixth Committee, resigned due to official business and was replaced by Feng Youzhen. Xu Shihao and Feng Youzhen, the conveners of the Tenth Committee, resigned and were replaced by Zhu Fuju and Wu Zhengxuan. These changes will be submitted to the assembly for approval. Reporters are allowed to attend the committee reviews, but they must abide by the conveners' decisions if they believe that a certain proposal should not be published in advance.</p>
<p>The review meetings will be held from approximately 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The locations are divided into three places: the First Committee at Pubo Road, the Fifth District Office, the Fourth Committee at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the other eight committees still at the Yiyuan.</p>
<p>The list of secretaries invited to attend each committee is as follows: First Committee: Li Xuexun, Second Committee: Wang Zhijing, Third Committee: Mei Jianyin, Fourth Committee: Xie Yanqing, Fifth Committee: Zhang Zhongfu, Sixth Committee: Li Caiqing, Seventh Committee: Lei Kenan, Eighth Committee: Cheng Qizhou, Ninth Committee: Chen Kecheng, Tenth Committee: Wang Bing.</p>

<p>[This newspaper report] It is reported that the total final accounts of the autonomous portion of this city for the 34th year are for the four and a half months of revenue and expenditure from the date of establishment on August 16th of the 34th year to the end of December. The final accounts have already been compiled within the prescribed time limit. The total amount of the final accounts of revenue and expenditure is 1,849,507,550 yuan each. The item of final revenue includes 487,653,822 yuan of central government subsidies.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Municipal Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan Reports: To Run Shanghai Well, Monthly Expenses Must Increase by 6 Billion Yuan. Current Tax Revenue Is Still in an Unreasonable Stage <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The meeting was announced to be opened at 3:15 PM. After the Secretary-General reported on the number of attendees and the brief situation of the morning meeting, Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan began his report. Mr. Gu's speech was divided into two aspects: revenue and expenditure situation and the collection system:</p>
<p>(1) Revenue and expenditure situation: In the first half of the year, the city's local revenue was over 14.59 billion yuan, and expenditure was over 20.72 billion yuan, a shortfall of over 6.13 billion yuan, all of which was compensated by central government subsidies. Generally speaking, the city's local revenue has been progressing month by month. The reasons are that, first, the result of rising prices; second, the result of rectifying tax collection. Because prices rise, tax revenue naturally increases. However, prices have only increased by more than two times in the past six months, while tax revenue has increased by more than six times. The net increase is entirely due to the effectiveness of rectifying tax collection. The revenue and expenditure in June had even reached a balance, but because the salaries of civil servants were adjusted at the end of the month and paid out in July, there was another shortfall. Through hard work in July and August, August was close to balance again, but because the salaries of civil servants were adjusted again, it was difficult to make up for it from September onwards. The repeated adjustments of the salaries of central government employees and teachers, although providing some relief to those who have suffered hardships for a long time, are a huge burden on the government's finances.</p>
<p>(2) Collection system: 1. House tax: The house tax registers for districts such as Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and former extraterritorial roads were scattered and incomplete when they were taken over last year and must be re-surveyed. Preparations are currently underway. The house tax collection procedures have now been simplified so that taxpayers can pay anywhere without having to be designated to a specific area. The summer house tax was collected in July, and the clothing fees for the security corps and epidemic prevention funds were collected together, all for one season only. 2. Entertainment tax was reduced to 40% from August 1st. The banquet tax implements the official bill and hall register stamping method, first by having stores automatically declare and pay, and then conducting random checks and implementing on-site collection if there is any inaccuracy. 3. The central government originally stipulated that the land tax should be collected in kind. Because this city has more difficulties, it has been approved to collect it in legal tender. The originally stipulated amount of 9.2 dou (a unit of dry measure) is now being requested to be paid at 40% to show extra sympathy for the hardships of farmers. 5. Regarding the license tax, there is a dispute over the interpretation of the law for the business license tax, and there are also problems with the calculation standards. Repeated requests have been made to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval. The license tax for use was originally based on the vehicle tax rate before the reform. Now, due to rising prices, it has been revised to collect five times the amount in the second half of the year. 6. The slaughter tax officially established a collection office in July to unify the collection in the urban and suburban areas.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu, when discussing the future of finance, stated that a sound financial system is based on a sound system on the one hand and a sound budget on the other.</p>
<p>The biggest shortcoming at present is that a sound financial system has never been established, and the distribution of tax revenue is still in an unreasonable state. Because over 70% of the income comes from banquet tax and entertainment tax, but this type of tax is a regulatory tax on behavior, the so-called "discouraging through taxation." The more effective the execution, the less the income, and the more difficult the collection, the higher the cost, and there are seasonal fluctuations. It is extremely unsuitable for long-term municipal construction projects. According to the previous concession era, 40% of the income was house tax, 30% was land tax, and over 10% was license tax. Taking the city tax revenue of the United States as an example, real estate tax accounts for over 92%. Therefore, house tax is the most reasonable, universal, and fair source of tax revenue. Currently, house tax revenue in this city only accounts for 4% in the first half of the year. In July and August, due to the increase in other types of tax revenue, it has been reduced to 2%. The land tax is still in the active preparation stage. The license tax, such as rickshaws, only collects 2,000 yuan per vehicle, and the total percentage is even smaller. This unreasonable phenomenon must be reformed.</p>
<p>The total amount of the estimated budget for the second half of the year is 84.7 billion yuan. At first glance, the numbers seem quite alarming, but if calculated at 5,000 times, it only amounts to over 16 million yuan before the war. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the total budget of the three administrative institutions in this city was over 47 million yuan. Therefore, compared, it cannot be considered high. The only question is whether the citizens have the ability to bear it. The current population is more than double that of before the war, although economic strength has been greatly reduced, but as long as each person bears 36% of the pre-war burden, the budget target can be achieved. As for how to open up new sources of tax revenue, four proposals have been submitted this time. If only maintaining the current state of the municipal government's work is to be satisfied, then an increase of 3.5 billion yuan per month is required to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure. If we go a step further and hope that the municipal government can carry out construction and truly run Shanghai well, then an increase of 6 billion yuan per month is required. In short, I hope that the council can review in detail to achieve a reasonable result. In addition, regarding enhancing work efficiency, I have always been law-abiding and set an example. If subordinates have illegal behavior, I hope they will be reported at any time with their names.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Finance Bureau Director Answers Questions <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The main content and Director Gu's answers to the oral inquiries made to the Finance Bureau Director by Ji Hao, Gong Xia, Tao Baichuan, Li Wenjie, and other nine people are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Question: How can the situation of evasion of banquet tax be improved? Answer: Frankly speaking, it is difficult to investigate. The best way is to hope that citizens must obtain invoices from restaurants after dining. On the one hand, severely punish those who are found to be evading taxes. Punish them once for the total sales amount of one day. Alternatively, use the method of sending people to sit and check, and calculate the monthly tax amount based on the sales amount for two to three days.</p>
<p>(2) Question: What is the standard for house tax collection? It seems to be too high and encourages landlords to increase rents? Answer: The current house tax continues to use the standard of the Public Works Department and is collected at twice the amount. The Public Works Department investigated the standard for collecting house rent very thoroughly based on various factors. As for the house tax exceeding the rent, this is because the current fixed rent method is used, which will not have an impact.</p>
<p>(3) Question: The starting point for the banquet tax is indeed too low. Can the Finance Bureau raise it? Answer: Several dozens of civilian cafeterias are currently exempt from banquet tax. In addition, it is stipulated that set meals are not taxed. The price of a set meal was originally set at 1,300 yuan, and it is now planned to be raised to 1,440 yuan. The catering industry, on the other hand, has requested an increase to 1,600 yuan, which is currently under consideration.</p>
<p>(4) Question: What is the situation of revenue and expenditure for the Baojia (mutual security system)? Answer: The total revenue is over 300 million yuan, and over 270 million yuan has been spent. It is currently temporarily stored by this bureau.</p>
<p>In addition, Tao Baichuan's question was more in the nature of a suggestion. He believes that the review of the municipal government's budget for the second half of the year will be one of the most important tasks of the council and must be approached cautiously and rigorously. He advocates that all councilors should first conduct a review of principles, and then hand it over to a subcommittee for detailed study. Li Wenjie echoed his opinion and hoped that the municipal government would report in detail the policy guidelines and work plans for the second half of the year. Director Gu believes that these two suggestions are very valuable and stated that if the assembly implements a review of principles, he is willing to attend and listen to explain and supplement.</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan, who has been the most enthusiastic in questioning these days.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Most Councilors Oppose the Issue of Restoring Horse Racing <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] In order to make up for financial revenue, the municipal government of this city submitted a motion to the Municipal Council through the mayor, proposing to open the horse racing track on Nanjing Road in this city and restore horse racing to increase tax revenue. Before this case was formally submitted to the assembly for discussion, the councilors had already expressed their objections one after another. According to inquiries from reporters to several councilors, the opinions varied, but according to a certain councilor, 80 to 90 percent of all councilors expressed opposition to this point.</p>
<p>The councilors Zhao Dihua, Zhao Junhao, Zhou Feicheng, Lu Huimin, Zhang Zhongyuan, etc., who opposed horse racing, put forward roughly the same reasons, stating that horse racing has a tendency to promote gambling. If horse racing can be held, then other similar gambling activities can follow suit. Feng Youzhen and Zhao Junhao suggested that the horse racing track be converted into a Shanghai Cultural City, which would include three parts: (1) the council site (because it is the highest body of public opinion), (2) cultural groups such as the Education Association, Journalists Association, Art Association, Library, Museum, Revolutionary History Exhibition Hall, etc., and (3) converting the racecourse into the Roosevelt Sports Field. It is heard that Councilors Feng and Zhao will submit a formal proposal to the assembly for discussion and will formulate methods for recovery.</p>
<p>Tong Daoyun's opinion is to convert the horse racing track into a gymnasium so that Shanghai has a large gathering place. At the same time, Jing'an Temple Road can directly connect to Ma Huo Road. Opening this road can also create another road, and traffic difficulties can be solved in part. Jin Hongxiang believes that horse racing has no relationship with productive enterprises. It seems unnecessary to hold it at a time when industry and commerce are in urgent need of development. Shen Ding said: The city's tax revenue relies entirely on banquet and entertainment taxes. Mayor Wu and Director Gu also believe that it is unsound and needs to be improved. If horse racing can increase tax revenue, then is this tax a sound tax? It is worth considering. Shi Zhifu said: Horse racing is not only similar to gambling, but the behind-the-scenes hosts, horse owners, and jockeys are inevitably linked in some cases. If horse tickets are sold and lottery tickets are drawn, there may be monopoly phenomena. Secondly, Shanghai has become the largest city in China, and horse racing in this prosperous area is somewhat inappropriate for the environment, but some of the buildings are worth preserving. Ma Junshuo stated that the horse racing track should be taken back as the site of the council and should not be held during this period of industrial and commercial decline. Tao Baichuan's opinion is: Two points must be studied first regarding this issue: (1) How to raise the 30 billion yuan shortfall in the budget for the second half of the year in Muben? (2) How much tax can be collected from horse racing, and how much help can it provide to municipal expenses? If the amount of the shortfall cannot be reduced, and the method of raising funds is to increase the burden on the general public, then it is better to have the rich bear the horse racing tax. But even so, I still don't approve of horse racing. The hall should be used for entertainment and cultural activities. I also don't approve of dog racing, because horse racing is not as time-consuming as dog racing, and gambling is the main business.</p>
<p>Regarding those who principally support it: Xu Xueyu put forward two points: (1) He does not oppose horse racing. Horse racing should not be regarded as gambling, but should be regarded as a sport. The location should be in the suburbs, and the time should be on holidays. (2) He does not approve of it being held at the horse racing track. The hall should be taken back as a public place. Luo Qinghua supports holding it in Jiangwan, and the original site should be converted into a sports field or a park. Yan Esheng said: Some businesses such as brothels can currently exist and pay taxes, so horse racing can also collect taxes and increase revenue. Shui Xiangyun and Zhu Fuju meant: Shanghai is an international city, and horse racing can also exercise the body. If it is not mainly for gambling, it may as well be held, but it should be set up in the suburbs.</p>

<p>[This newspaper report] Yang Limo (from Shaoxing), the general manager of the Jinling Leather Wallet Company in Nanjing's Confucius Temple, and Li Fengqi (from Wuxi), the deputy manager, founded the Jinling Department Store on July 1, with capital of 144 million yuan. They also opened a Shanghai branch at No. 33-34, Manfu Building, Hankou Road in this city. Due to its large scale, it attracted deposits of over 300 million yuan. On August 31, Yang and Li fled to Shanghai with the company's seals and private seals because they had issued bad checks and were unable to make up for them. At the same time, senior employees Wang Ruhui, Chen Jiafen, and Zhou Along also fled. Huang Yuzhi, the shareholder and assistant manager of the company, reported to the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters to send personnel to the company to move the goods and equipment. On the one hand, he sent personnel to come to Shanghai with Huang to investigate the whereabouts of Yang and Li. On the 9th, he reported to the Laozha Sub-bureau. Jiang Shangpei, the chief of the criminal section, ordered the police to search for information everywhere. He learned that Chen Jiafen was hiding at No. 63, Xieqiao Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, and immediately went to the address to arrest Chen. Not long after, Zhou Along arrived and was captured as well. They were taken to the bureau for strict interrogation. However, they all denied knowing the whereabouts of Yang and Li. In order to catch them, the sub-bureau first allowed Chen and Zhou to be released on bail and set a time limit for investigating the whereabouts of Yang and Li. On the one hand, the police were sent to guard at No. 63, Xieqiao Lane. On the 10th, a phone call suddenly came, revealing that Yang was living at No. 1404, Disiwei Road, in the Xin Wuweizhai Dim Sum Shop. The bureau did not show any signs and waited until about 3:00 AM the next morning. Section member Feng Xiushan led the police to rush there. After knocking on the back door for a long time, the shop firmly refused to open. The police officers then lurked in the lane to observe their movements. After more than an hour, they caught sight of someone on the upper floor flipping over the Gao Tou Gang Yi (a high stool). Fearing that there was someone below, they tiptoed down and hid next to the stove in the kitchen. The police officers immediately stepped forward to arrest him, and learned that it was Yang. Yang also confessed that Li Fengqi and Pan were hiding at No. 15, Gengqing Lane, Xinzha Road. They continued to pursue and arrest them, and took them to the bureau for interrogation. They confessed without denial. Yesterday, the guarantor who guaranteed Zhou Along suddenly falsely claimed to the Laozha Police Bureau that Zhou had already committed suicide in anger because he could not find Yang and Li, and presented a handkerchief with a suicide note written in pencil on it. Upon receiving the report, the police bureau sent personnel to the guarantor's residence to investigate and saw that Zhou Along was still there. He was arrested again, and the handkerchief was presented to the case for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Corrupt and Neglectful Officials of the Land Administration Bureau Dismissed and Released on Bail Pending Trial; Director Zhu Ascends the Stage Three Times to Answer Inquiries; Impersonating a Township Representative, Zhou Songqian Sent to Court <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>After Director Zhu finished his report, the oral inquiries began. The questions posed by Councilor Tao Baichuan were the most heated and intense. Mr. Tao asked: According to reports, senior officials of the Land Administration Bureau are selling their positions and engaging in corruption, involving tens of millions of dollars. Many people are implicated. Has the Land Administration Bureau investigated this matter thoroughly, and what is the progress? Director Zhu replied that there were indeed cases of fraud. As early as April of this year, the Land Administration Bureau, in response to the request of the people of Gaoqiao District in Pudong, returned more than 600 mu of farmland that had been forcibly occupied by the enemy. At that time, the Land Administration Bureau decided to recover 20,000 yuan per mu, but the township representative in charge of the matter actually collected 80,000 yuan per mu. This person lived in Shanghai and falsely claimed to be a township representative. He has now been handed over to the court and is awaiting the court's decision. As for whether Land Administration Bureau officials are involved, it is still under investigation. As of now, there is no factual evidence. The responsible section chief has been dismissed and released on bail pending trial. However, Mr. Tao was not satisfied with the above reply and continued to inquire: Who was dismissed? Why was he dismissed? Why was he released on bail instead of being sent to court? Is it true that tens of millions of dollars were embezzled? Who else is involved? What is the progress of the investigation? Director Zhu replied: After the investigation, the person in charge should have been sent to court, but because no conclusive evidence was obtained, he was temporarily released on bail. Because the township representative was an imposter, the person in charge should be held responsible for negligence in failing to investigate, so he was dismissed. The case is currently under investigation by the court, and if the court believes it needs to be prosecuted, it will definitely be strictly handled. However, several councilors, including Lu Yinchu, were still not satisfied with the above supplementary reply and insisted that Director Zhu announce the names of the dismissed personnel and the amount of embezzlement. At this time, the atmosphere at the meeting became very tense, and Director Zhu ascended the stage three times to answer, saying: The dismissed section chief of the Land Administration Bureau is called Zhang Jiliang, the staff member is called Huang Qiren, and the person who impersonated the township representative is Zhou Songqian. As for the amount of embezzlement, it is still under investigation and cannot be reported, as it is not known how much money was collected from the farmers. This matter should originally be investigated by the court, but the Land Administration Bureau is also actively sending people to investigate, and once there are results, it will definitely be announced.</p>
<p>Other oral inquiries and Director Zhu's replies are briefly described below. Zhang Zhongyuan asked to whom does the property rights of the Racecourse belong, and what is the nationality of the owner? Director Zhu replied: The situation of the Racecourse is being investigated by the Finance Bureau, but the Land Administration Bureau also knows a little about it. The Racecourse has a long history and covers an area of more than 500 mu. The racetrack and the surrounding 100 mu belong to the Racecourse Association. About 400 mu inside the racetrack belong to the Sports Association. There is also a small portion of private property and tombs. As for the property rights of the Racecourse, they have not been registered and belong to the "Dao Qi" (an old kind of land deed). However, the government also has the right to requisition it if it wants to, because the Racecourse only has the right to lease and does not have ownership.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of re-evaluating land prices, the central government has already issued a complete regulation. It is decided by the Evaluation Committee. The land appreciation tax is determined according to the price index. Because the increase in land prices is actually the result of the depreciation of the legal currency, not the appreciation of the land itself, it would be unreasonable to levy the land appreciation tax. Therefore, before the currency system is stable, the collection will be postponed. Unless someone buys it for 60 million today and sells it for 70 million tomorrow, then the land appreciation tax will be levied. Land illegally disposed of by puppet organizations is invalid, even if it is purchased in good faith. This is stipulated by central laws. However, we are currently requesting instructions from the central government to see if there are any other compensation measures.</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of real estate by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, there is always contact with the Land Administration Bureau, and a small group has been formed in conjunction with the Central Trust Bureau to consult with each other. The Housing Management Committee is jointly organized by the Provisional Council, the Court, the Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Garrison Command, and the relevant bureaus of the Municipal Government. A total of more than 3,600 cases have been received, and more than 1,800 cases have been mediated. It can be said that considerable achievements have been made. In addition to mediation, rental rates have also been assessed. Currently, new rules are being submitted for approval to grant the Housing Management Committee the power of adjudication. As for banning key money, although it is an established policy, it is an economic problem and cannot be fundamentally solved by political forces. Regarding the "land price appraisal from price tax," although it is Sun Yat-sen's will, the Legislative Yuan has added land valuation methods to supplement it. How to enable tillers to own their land is being planned and drafted by the central government.</p>

<p>More and more councilors are arriving late. Yesterday afternoon at three o'clock, there were very few people in the meeting place. When the meeting was announced at a quarter past three, there were only 96 people signed in.</p>
<p>The original brewed tea, one cup per guest, was changed to ordinary black tea the day before yesterday afternoon, and yesterday it was restored to the original brewed tea.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, when discussing whether to participate in the investigation team, Tao Baichuan sometimes put his fountain pen in his nostril and sometimes took it out to write quickly.</p>
<p>Finance Bureau Director Gu Chunfan wore a navy blue top and white canvas trousers, looking very refined. When reporting, he called himself "Chunfan," but the last time, he called himself "this member."</p>
<p>Director Gu's Suzhou dialect was still clear and crisp, but when explaining the banquet tax, when he said "eat at a restaurant," the "eat" sounded like "go to court."</p>
<p>When answering inquiries, Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei mentioned that some night soil boats dump the night soil in the Huangpu River halfway. He said, "I am preparing to disguise myself and investigate."</p>
<p>Director Zhang also said: "The charging standards in hospitals depend on the patient's identity. Wealthy people are not happy if the fees are too low."</p>
<p>Land Administration Bureau Director Zhu Ping was asked to come to the stage three times to explain the bureau's corruption case. In the end, he was forced to reveal the names of the corrupt officials, which looked quite embarrassing.</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, it was stipulated that councilors must speak at the microphone on the podium when making oral inquiries, and this was strictly enforced. One time, Tao Baichuan stood up and said, "I have a simple opinion. Can I express it from my seat?" In the end, Zhu Neng got his wish.</p>
<p>When councilors go to the podium to speak, they put on their coats. After speaking, they return to their seats and take them off, which is quite busy.</p>
<p>The afternoon meeting was extended twice, the first time by half an hour, and the second time by another 20 minutes. Acting Chairman Xu Jilao said, "It cannot exceed one minute more," but as a result, Director Gu answered inquiries until six o'clock before stopping. Director Pang Jing of the Health Bureau put on his coat and left first.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Flood Prevention Projects in This City are Being Actively Implemented in Various Districts; Clearing Ditches and Pipes to Improve Drainage Efficiency; Dredging Rivers and Harbors to Open More Drainage Outlets <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] At 1:30 p.m. yesterday, the Public Works Bureau hosted the local press in the Municipal Government's conference room. Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau, Director Xu Yifang of the Drainage Engineering Department, Deputy Director Yu Haoming, Chief Engineer Gu Kangle, Specialist Qian Weifan, and Director Zhu Xubai of the Municipal Government's Information Office attended, along with more than 50 reporters from various newspapers. Director Zhao first reported on the bureau's general work and three major problems: 1. Flood prevention; 2. Construction of affordable housing; 3. Connecting the north-south trunk roads. The main difficulty with the first two problems lies in the shortage of funds. The difficulty with the third problem is based on the fact that before the war, the city was divided into three spheres of influence (the former British and French Concessions and the Municipal Government). While east-west traffic is very smooth, north-south traffic is blocked. Therefore, according to the Public Works Bureau's plan, it was originally intended to widen Xizang Road and Zhejiang Road, but there were many objections to demolishing the houses along the road, which prevented the plan from being implemented.</p>
<p>Waterlogging Problem Long Unresolved</p>
<p>After Director Zhao finished his report, Director Xu Yifang of the Drainage Engineering Department reported on the detailed situation of the current flood control on the roads. He said that the waterlogging problem has always been a serious problem in Shanghai. The former British Concession authorities had made some efforts, but failed to solve it. After the Public Works Bureau took over, it is feared that it will not be able to find a thorough solution in two or three years. After discussion by the bureau's engineers, it was believed that the main causes of waterlogging are: (1) The diameter of the drains is too small, resulting in slow flow and easy siltation. (2) The terrain of the city is too low, and the outlets of the rainwater drains either have no tide gates, or the tide gates are damaged, causing tidal water to backflow and flood the road surface. (3) The rivers and harbors at the outlets of the rainwater drains have not been dredged, and the construction of houses in western Shanghai during the enemy and puppet period lacked management, filling in the river channels and hindering the discharge of rainwater. (4) Citizens are not aware of public health and dump garbage into the rivers and harbors, which easily causes siltation.</p>
<p>Flood Prevention Measures Target the Root Cause</p>
<p>After understanding the causes of waterlogging, the Public Works Bureau decided to take targeted flood prevention measures. In recent years, the work has focused on the following: (A) Clearing drains and pipes to improve drainage efficiency. (B) Dredging rivers and harbors to facilitate discharge. (C) Reconstructing and enlarging bottleneck drains to smooth the water flow. (D) Repairing tide gates, dams, and pumping stations to prevent tidal backflow and pump out rainwater. (E) Raising particularly low road surfaces to prevent rainwater from flowing down the road surface and pooling. (F) Opening more drainage outlets and significantly enlarging them to increase drainage capacity. The above flood prevention projects are all being actively carried out.</p>
<p>90% of West Shanghai's Rivers and Harbors Completed</p>
<p>Currently, 97% of the rivers and harbors in the western Shanghai area have been completed. Only a section near Dapu Bridge remains, which is being excavated with a dredger and will be completed within two weeks. In addition, the motive for repairing tide gates, dams, and pumping stations is that the city's terrain is low-lying. To prevent tidal backflow from overflowing the road surface, tide gates or sluice gates were originally installed, but due to years of disrepair, they leaked severely. A total of 164 tide gates have been rebuilt and completed. The purpose of the sluice gate and pumping station project is to prevent tidal backflow. During heavy rains, the pumps are also activated to pump out rainwater. Currently, three pumping stations are under construction: the Jiahama River, the Rihui Port, and the Caojiadu No. 1 River at the entrance to the Suzhou River, each pumping 60,000 gallons of water per minute.</p>
<p>Road Surface Raised, No More Waterlogging</p>
<p>In addition, the section of Kangding Road west of Yanping Road in the city has a particularly low-lying terrain. After the road surface was raised, there is no more waterlogging. Currently, the sections of Fanyu Road are being raised. The above flood prevention work has proven its effectiveness after the rainstorm on the evening of August 31. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the rainfall that day was the highest in the past 15 years, but the degree of waterlogging was not very serious, and the water receded relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Director Xu concluded: Drainage engineering is to the city as the foundation is to a house, because it has a great impact on transportation and sanitation. Due to the limitations of the city's terrain and the current state of the drainage system, it is truly a long-term and arduous task, but the Public Works Bureau will definitely go all out.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Wen Lantina Case to be Announced This Morning <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] It is heard that the High Court concluded the case of Wen Lantina's suspected treason on the 5th of this month, and the verdict will be announced this morning at 9:30 in the Criminal Division One of the High Court in Tilanqiao.</p>
<p>In addition, the cases of Liu Xun, the puppet captain of the Wu Xing County Security Brigade, Wu Binglin, the puppet Baozhang (local leader), Gui Ronghai, the translator for the enemy gendarmerie, and Gao A'er, the foreman, who are suspected of being traitors, will also be announced at the same time.</p>
<p>High Court Tried Many Cases Yesterday</p>
<p>[This newspaper] Zhang Jinzhang, who once served as the deputy chairman of the puppet Shanghai Gaoqiao Town Maintenance Association, was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of being a traitor. The High Court concluded the trial yesterday and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 17th of this month. In addition, Lu Falang, the translator for the enemy gendarmerie, will also be sentenced on the same day.</p>
<p>Gu Huanzhang, the owner of the Xiang Sheng Leather Factory in this city, was arrested after the victory because he served as the chairman of the puppet Shanghai Leather Industry Association during the enemy and puppet occupation period. After the High Court concluded the trial, the verdict was originally scheduled to be announced yesterday morning, but because evidence was still needed for investigation, it was ordered to reopen the debate.</p>
<p>Le Jiajun, an investigator of the Fifth Section of the puppet Shanghai Economic Bureau, was accused of extorting 40,000 yuan in puppet currency from the Yi Chang Silk Store on Shanxi Road in this city while in office, together with Luo Jinghe, the puppet section chief. After the victory, he was reported by someone and sentenced to five years in prison by the High Court. The defendant refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court in Nanjing, which ordered a retrial. The defendant claimed that the 40,000 yuan was not extorted but was a festival gift voluntarily offered by the store. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court reopened the trial and summoned Zhang Zhichang to testify. The case was adjourned for retrial.</p>
<p>In addition, Hu Guangrong, a detective from the puppet Shanghai West Hongkou Police Station, abused his power and extorted money. Yesterday, Yang Hongshi and others were summoned to court to testify. Ren Musheng, Lin Zeyuan, Li Xiangsheng, Li Zhetang, and Wang Runhe, intelligence officers of the enemy gendarmerie, jointly framed innocent people. Zeng Zhangshi, Li Yangshi, and Ren Xiongshi were summoned to court to inquire. In addition, the defendant in the Shen Wenda case did not appear. After investigation in the Jin Yulin case, all the above cases were ordered to be retried at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Subsidence Phenomenon in Shanghai is Nothing to Worry About <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau said at yesterday's press conference that when he took office, Mr. Clark, the former director of the Public Works Department of the former Municipal Council, told him that Shanghai has a subsidence phenomenon. According to geographical trends, coastal land is prone to this phenomenon, which is not dangerous. The direct impact on citizens is the waterlogging problem. As for the subsidence of skyscrapers such as the Park Hotel, it is also due to the city's geological conditions. If the subsidence is even, there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Estates of Three Traitors to be Auctioned Off <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The entire estates of Chen Gongbo, Chu Minyi, and Miao Bin, three traitors, have been transferred by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau to the Central Trust Bureau. They will be publicly auctioned off after clearing, valuation, and sorting. As for the hidden properties of the three traitors, the Administration Bureau's traitor property team is actively continuing the investigation and will issue a public notice in the near future to encourage confidential reports and denunciations. The confidential reporting method is the same as before. However, since the three traitors are executed criminals, their hidden properties will be auctioned off immediately after they are found. The confidential reporting bonus (10% of the total value) can also be received immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Street Vendors on Avenue Pétain (now Jinan Road) Are Also Being Eliminated; Vendors Request Preservation from the Municipal Government and Police Bureau <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Jinan Road (formerly Avenue Pétain) in this city has always been a famous concentration of street vendors, with more than 200 stalls selling furniture and household goods. Some vendors have been setting up stalls there since the early years of the Republic of China. Recently, the Municipal Police Bureau was ordered to eliminate street vendors throughout the city, and Avenue Pétain was also affected. The vendors there believe that Avenue Pétain is not a major transportation route, no cars ever pass through it, and the rickshaws and handcarts that come and go are all customers who buy goods, so they do not hinder traffic. Moreover, because it is located in a remote area, there are very few pedestrians, so it does not affect the city's appearance. Furthermore, the goods sold by the vendors are furniture and miscellaneous items, not general "American goods," and there are no smuggled goods. Therefore, they have submitted a document to the Municipal Government Police Bureau requesting the preservation of the stalls on this road.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Elimination is Determined; Vendors' Petition is in Vain <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] According to the Municipal Police Bureau, the elimination of street vendors must be thoroughly implemented, because the mayor is very determined on this matter. Therefore, the vendors' petition to the mayor the other day, requesting a concentrated area and continued permission to operate, is purely a waste of time, because the elimination is an established policy of the Municipal Government and will absolutely not be changed due to collective petitions.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Jiang Tingfu's Talk of Resignation Formally Denied by UNRRA <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Director Jiang Tingfu of the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) has been resting at home due to illness since hosting a review meeting on UNRRA's work in Nanjing a few days ago. According to the doctor, Mr. Jiang needs to continue to rest for a few more days before he can go to the office. During the review meeting, Mr. Jiang made a very frank statement when mentioning the criticisms of UNRRA from various parties, saying, "In order to seek their own interests, the shipping companies in our country do not hesitate to disregard the millions of starving refugees. This is one of the most disappointing events of this year." Mr. Jiang also reiterated that the 432 billion yuan in disaster relief funds allocated by the government is based on UNRRA's budget, but UNRRA has not received a penny so far, and all expenses still have to rely on loans and the sale of materials. Mr. Jiang also expressed his willingness to resign in order to go to the United States to lecture. Recently, there have been rumors in the city about Mr. Jiang's talk of resignation, which may be related to his words. Yesterday afternoon, a UNRRA spokesman formally denied this, but the general public is still watching closely.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Good News for Public School Employees: Meal Boxes Begin Distribution; Edible Even If Moldy <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>It is learned that the Municipal Distribution Office for Public School Employees has decided that the first distribution of goods will be KD meal boxes, each with a value of 9,000 yuan. These samples have been displayed at 200 Fuzhou Road. The K-style meal box includes eight or nine kinds of food. The D-style meal box is mainly chocolate, and its components include seven nutrients such as milk, oatmeal, and vitamin B. They are all the most nutritious rations jointly supplied to the US military by various American factories. The second phase of distributed items is cotton cloth, which has been approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau for the 128th time. The price has also been determined and is cheaper than the market price. Four people share one bolt. According to the person in charge of the office, the 20 printed flower tickets attached to the purchase certificate, the red "Tian" tickets, are specifically for purchasing KD meal boxes and must be purchased with a ticket. The "Di" tickets are specifically for distributing cotton cloth. Those who receive these printed flower tickets should keep them safe. If they are lost, they will not be reissued. It is also learned that the office has a contract with the Materials Supply Bureau. All daily necessities that can be supplied to public school employees will be allocated by the office as much as possible. In order to facilitate public school employees to select and purchase items, the office will establish a retail department and purchase a variety of daily necessities from the Supply Bureau, and distribute one type of printed flower ticket per month. It is also learned that there may be a very small number of moldy D-type meal boxes in the first distribution. The office sent them to the Health and Chemical Testing Institute for inspection, and it was reported that the moldy D-type meal boxes can still be eaten after boiling.

<p>[This newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyue Wheel encountered wind on the Haikou sea off Hainan Island last Sunday and was in danger. According to news from the bureau yesterday, the typhoon in Hainan Island has dissipated, and the Haiyue Wheel has also escaped danger. It is heard that the ship suffered heavy losses, with two anchors lost and the hull damaged. There was slight water ingress in each cabin. Efforts are now being made to seal the flooded areas, and it is planned to sail to Hong Kong for repairs. In addition, the company's Haixia Wheel, which has been under repair for several months to add passenger seats, has now been completed and is scheduled to sail to Keelung next week. It is heard that the ship must carry several technical personnel from the National Resources Commission to Okinawa. Therefore, for the first voyage, it will first go to Okinawa and then sail to Keelung. The Haixia Wheel, which was assigned to the Philippine route, once sailed to Tianjin. After returning to Shanghai a few days ago, it prepared all the procedures for going to the Philippines. It was learned yesterday that public school employees from North China in Shanghai urgently want to return north. In order to take care of the public school employees, the bureau ordered the Haixia Wheel to sail to Tianjin again on the 14th. The next time, it will be decided to sail to the Philippines.</p>
<p>Strike Affects Ships Returning to the United States</p>
<p>[This newspaper] The American seafarers' strike has a significant impact. The SS General Heintzelman, an American President Lines ship, is scheduled to leave Shanghai today to return to the United States but will not stop at San Francisco for the time being. The Fenwick Reeve, managed by Shuntong Shipping Company, will also leave the dock today and sail to New York, without stopping at San Francisco. In addition, the SS Kina, managed by Danish merchant Bao Long Yanghang, was originally scheduled to sail to the United States in the coming days. Due to the American seafarers' strike, the ship will no longer sail to the United States and will return to Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Tong Shida Expresses: Train Tickets Will Definitely Not Increase in Price <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Tong Shida, the station master of Shanghai North Station, told reporters yesterday that although postal rates have been partially adjusted after the exchange rate adjustment, train ticket prices will definitely not increase. It has been just one year since the North Station was taken over. The first three months were the most difficult, but now it is gradually getting on track. Only the number of vehicles is insufficient. There is no shortage of coal for trains at present. There are also plans to restore the South Station, but it is feared that it will be difficult to realize in the short term. As for the locomotives transported by UNRRA, they require diesel. If they are to be used, oil pools must be added to each station, so they cannot be used.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Great American Radio Obeys Our Laws; Will Automatically Close or be Operated by Chinese <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Since the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications was ordered to ban illegally established radio stations in this city, all sectors have been concerned about the disposal of foreign radio stations in this city. The reporter visited Mr. Yu Bingjian, the director of the Telecommunications Bureau, yesterday and inquired about this matter. According to him, the American radio station XMHA has sent personnel to the bureau to express its willingness to obey the laws of our government and will automatically stop broadcasting if necessary. The Great American Radio Station played a significant role in our country's resistance against Japan after the Japanese occupied this city, relying on the protection of the old concession. It is heard that there is a plan to have the radio station sold and operated by Chinese. As for other radio stations such as the Soviet Broadcasting Station, although they have been notified, a decision on their disposal must be made after the Ministry of Communications consults with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and goes through diplomatic procedures.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Using Counterfeit Money, Resulting in Prosecution <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Claiming Ignorance During Trial</p>
<p>[This newspaper] The District Court opened a trial yesterday morning for a case of using counterfeit money. On July 20 of this year, a customer came to the Fang Zijin Gold Store at 659 Dongchangzhi Road to buy two gold bracelets. Yue Junting, a staff member of the store, negotiated with the customer. The customer paid 300,000 yuan in new banknotes and 200,000 yuan in banknotes of other versions from the Central Bank. Afterwards, the store discovered that the 300,000 yuan in new banknotes was counterfeit, but did not report it to the police for destruction. Instead, Yue took 80,000 yuan of it to Ningbo for use, and the remaining 220,000 yuan was kept in the store for mixed use. On the 23rd of the same month, Shu Zhangshi, a woman from Ningbo living at 81 Tongchun Lane, Gongping Road, came to redeem gold jewelry worth a total of 153,500 yuan. The store paid her 150,000 yuan in counterfeit banknotes and another 3,500 yuan. Because Shu Zhangshi owed Zhu Deyu, who lived at 4 Lane 252 Huishan Road, 150,000 yuan, she paid the counterfeit banknotes to Zhu. Zhu deposited 100,000 yuan of it into the Juxingcheng Bank and 50,000 yuan into the Baohua Money Exchange on Tianjin Road. The money exchange discovered it and returned it. Zhu negotiated with Shu Zhangshi and went to the Fang Zijin Gold Store to question them. While they were arguing, they were discovered by the police on the road, who took them to the police station and transferred them to the District Procuratorate for investigation. It was believed that Yue Junting had intentionally used counterfeit money, and that Shu Zhangshi and Zhu Deyu had paid out all the money after receiving it, and were suspected of knowing that it was counterfeit money and using it to avoid losses. Therefore, they were prosecuted together according to law. During the trial yesterday, all the defendants claimed that they did not know it was counterfeit money and hired lawyers to defend them. After the judge questioned them, he ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Affected by the War in Northern Jiangsu, Half of the Pig Dealers Closed Down; Current Arrivals for Lending Have Greatly Decreased, Relying Only on Xuzhou and Zhang Huang Port, Ren Port and a Few Other Places <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The source of fresh pigs in this city, with its largest producing area in Huaiyin, Northern Jiangsu, etc., since the goods from Huaiyin were interrupted due to the war, the new port of Jiangbei County, which was originally an export area for fresh pigs, has also recently been obstructed by the Communist army's extortion and harassment. Therefore, the arrival of goods in Shanghai has gradually become scarce. Yesterday, our reporter interviewed Xin Xiaokang, Hong Wenjiang, Xu Yunquan and other business leaders of the pig industry. According to them, the current prospects of the industry are becoming increasingly bleak and the situation is very serious. If this continues, there may be a total collapse. The trade association originally had more than 70 member firms, but due to the impact of the war in northern Jiangsu, by the Mid-Autumn Festival, Dayuan, Tongchang, Tianxin, Yifeng, and Juda and others have closed down and liquidated. Rentai, Baoxing, Wanda, Shengcheng, Sanhe Heji, Tongtai, and Shengyuan Yihe and others have temporarily suspended operations. In addition, there are also many who have not stopped operating but have no goods to supply the market. Therefore, the current actual number of members is only more than 30. The reasons are: (1) The source is cut off due to the war in northern Jiangsu, (2) Losses due to high interest rates, (3) If the loan for pigs is obstructed midway, they refuse to repay it on the pretext, (4) Frequent inspections by military police along the way cause delays, and the death of pigs also makes the dealers hesitate. Recently, fresh pigs have been transported by land from Bengbu to Shanghai by train from Nanjing, with a slight arrival of goods. In terms of waterways, only a small number of pig boats from Zhang Huang Port and Ren Port, two small ports in Jiangbei, have arrived to supply the market, maintaining the meat consumption of millions of people in Shanghai. We are now trying our best to reduce obstacles and unblock the source, in order to make a final struggle and reverse the decline.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Suspected of Theft by a Staff Member of the New New Company <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The New Cheng Police Sub-bureau received a tip-off on the 8th, saying that goods of unknown origin were hidden at No. 17, Lane 52, Huangpo Road. Song Bingzheng, the chief of the Criminal Division, ordered police chief Jiang Run and others to drive to investigate. According to the second landlord of the house, the front building where the goods were placed was rented by Wan Qiting (from Qidong, 32 years old), who lived at No. 13 in this lane. Wan worked in the hardware department of the New New Company. The investigating police officer immediately went to the New New Company to meet Manager Xiao and explained the purpose of the visit. Manager Xiao summoned Wan to the scene and took him to the bureau for interrogation. According to Wan's confession, his colleagues in the company organized a Xin Yuan Company in 1933, and all goods had invoices. However, after careful examination of the invoices, most of them were filled out by Wan himself. The rest of the invoices had no business registration proof. Also, a suitcase was deposited by a friend, who claimed that it was all clothes. However, after opening it, it was found to contain more than a dozen pieces of silk fabric, towels, socks, and other items. The sub-bureau preliminarily determined that there was a suspicion of theft, and applied to the District Prosecutor's Office for a seven-day detention to continue the investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e102">30,000 Overseas Chinese in Hawaii, Most of Whom Have Thriving Careers and High Status; There are Also Overseas Chinese Councilors in the Provincial Assembly; A Brief Talk by Mei Jingzhou, Consul General in Honolulu <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, I met Mr. Mei Jingzhou, the Consul General in Honolulu, who had recently returned to China. Because Mr. Mei has always been in Hawaii, my first question was: "Was Mr. Mei in Honolulu when the Pearl Harbor Incident happened?"</p>
<p>Mr. Mei waved his fan and said with a smile: "The Pearl Harbor Incident? I almost lost my life in this bombing!" He then told me that before the Pearl Harbor Incident, the sky over Honolulu had been filled with many American planes constantly flying around, busy with various air combat exercises. So when Japanese planes entered the sky, everyone thought they were American planes. Even when Pearl Harbor was bombed, everyone didn't know. It wasn't until they saw the big headlines on the extra that they knew that Japan had started. There were very few Japanese planes bombing in Honolulu, so the losses were relatively minor. However, an incendiary bomb exploded only 300 feet away from the Chinese Consulate. Fortunately, it landed in the woods, so there were no casualties. But the original intention of the Japanese planes was probably to deliberately bomb the Chinese Consulate. Speaking of this, Mr. Mei laughed: "Because they really hate me. I have always been dedicated to refuting the absurd and arrogant remarks of the Japanese. My name has long been on the blacklist in Tokyo."</p>
<p>I said, "What was the situation of the American military's preparations at that time?"</p>
<p>Mr. Mei's answer was: The Americans did have preparations, but they didn't expect the Japanese to act so quickly. Among the six islands of Hawaii, the total number of Japanese residents was 150,000, accounting for nearly 40% of the total population of 500,000. The Japanese consulate employed more than 100 special agents. Various information about the American military in the Hawaiian Islands had already been collected in great detail, so the bombing targets were quite accurate. In contrast, American counterintelligence work was somewhat inferior.</p>
<p>As for the number of overseas Chinese in Hawaii, Mr. Mei said that there were about 30,000 in total, of which 25,000 were born in Hawaii, so they had dual citizenship of both China and the United States. 80% of these 30,000 overseas Chinese are from Guangdong, especially from Zhongshan, Guangdong. Most of them have received higher education, and their businesses are very developed. They have a high reputation in the local area. There are now two banks run by overseas Chinese in Hawaii, and many trust companies. There are even more engaged in various other businesses.</p>
<p>The residents of Hawaii are now engaged in a movement to upgrade Hawaii's status from a "colony" to a "state." Although the plan to change to a "state" has not yet been realized, Hawaii already has its own provincial assembly. Among the overseas Chinese, there are two senators and six representatives in the provincial assembly. In the Honolulu city government, one overseas Chinese serves as an accountant, another serves as an auditor, and three overseas Chinese serve as councilors, all of whom are in quite important positions. In addition, there are 37 overseas Chinese doctors, 35 dentists, and 150 teachers (teaching in American schools). There are also two Chinese newspapers.</p>
<p>In mid-June of this year, several overseas Chinese in Hawaii jointly established Trans-Pacific Airline, which specializes in flying between the six major islands of Hawaii. When it was founded, the capital was only 500,000 US dollars, and there were only three or four twin-engine aircraft. But recently, in less than three months, the capital has increased to 10 million US dollars, and the number of aircraft has increased to 25, most of which are large four-engine passenger planes. Currently, Trans-Pacific Airline's passenger planes have eight flights every day. They very much hope to extend the routes to various ports in the motherland, but they don't know if the government will allow them to come. Mr. Mei said with emotion, "The efforts of these overseas Chinese are really admirable. If they can be allowed to assist in the development of China's air transport business, it will definitely make a great contribution to China. Although China now has several airlines, there are really still too few planes. Even for overseas Chinese who return home to visit relatives, they often don't have much difficulty taking a plane when they come back, but it is not easy to buy plane tickets when they want to go back to the United States. If we promote private aviation, we can encourage them to return to China for inspection and arouse their interest in investment."</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese did make great contributions during the Anti-Japanese War, and they were very enthusiastic in buying government bonds, donating money, and saving the country. However, the savings bonds have caused them considerable disappointment because the value of these bonds is now too low. But it is said that the government has now taken concrete steps to convert them into US dollars according to the exchange rate on the date when the overseas Chinese purchased the savings bonds, and then repay them according to the US dollar amount. Mr. Mei believes that this matter will definitely win the praise of many overseas Chinese, and, for the sake of the future, the government's doing so may not be a loss.</p>
<p>Mei Guang-sheng is from Taishan, Guangdong, and studied in the United States at an early age. During the European War, he served as the secretary of the Chinese Labor Youth Association in France. In 1929, he served as a member of the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1930, he served as the secretary of the Chinese Embassy in Cuba. In 1931, he served as the Consul in Havana, and in the same year, he was transferred to Honolulu as Consul. In 1934, he was promoted to Consul General in Honolulu, and has been in Honolulu for 15 years. Because he is extremely popular among the overseas Chinese, the overseas Chinese specially purchased land and donated a magnificent mansion for the Consulate General. During the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Mei was probably the one who most strongly criticized the Japanese invaders abroad. He recently plans to go to Guangzhou to see his relatives and old friends whom he has not seen for 17 years.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Scientists Take on Important Tasks in China's Nation-Building Work, Said British Ambassador at Scientists' Weekend Forum Yesterday <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Scientists' Weekend Forum was held at the World Society yesterday. Attendees included Li Shizeng, Pan Gongzhan, and Mrs. Cai Yuanpei, among others. British Ambassador Sir Steven was invited to attend. Li Shizeng delivered a speech first, stating that the person in charge of the association was originally Mr. Wu Zhihui, but due to his old age and slight discomfort, he could not attend. The connection between Chinese and British culture has a long history, and the fact that so many Chinese people can speak English today proves this. Cultural communication between countries is essential for mutual understanding on the road to peace. The outbreak of the recent war was based on this foundation, developing into an active anti-aggression movement. All parties assisted in the war, and the result was victory. It is hoped that this spirit will continue to be upheld and carried forward.</p>
<p>Now there is a New Treaty Foundation for Sino-British Friendship</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan then spoke, saying: Shanghai is a major historical center for Sino-British cultural contact. I deeply know the importance of the Sino-British cultural connection, so even during the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting, I specifically asked for leave to attend. During the war, China and Britain fought side by side and finally won. Now, Sino-British friendship has a new foundation, and it will surely become more intimate in the future. The British Ambassador is new to China, and if there is an opportunity to travel to various places in the future, he will know that China is truly a country that loves friends. I believe the Ambassador will feel happy. Shanghai is an international city, and its future development still needs the assistance of friendly countries. Later, Mrs. Cai Yuanpei said: If Chinese and British students can exchange more with each other, it will definitely be more beneficial to the friendship between the two countries. Mr. Cai often discussed this matter with Wells and Shaw when he was alive.</p>
<p>Amidst applause from the entire audience, the British Ambassador stood up and said: After many years of war, China is now in the development stage, and it urgently needs the assistance of the best minds in its nation-building work. Scientists have a particularly important task in this great work. If they want to succeed in their efforts, I believe that all experts must contribute their knowledge and ideas. Therefore, I feel that this meeting will definitely have a significant impact on China's future science and technology.</p>
<p>International Exchange of Ideas Contributes Greatly to China</p>
<p>The Ambassador went on to comment on the importance of exchanging ideas with other countries, pointing out that such exchanges are beneficial to all parties involved. In this regard, Western countries can contribute a lot to China, especially in the latest developments in science, technology, and industry. During the war, Britain made amazing developments in technology and scientific methods. Britain and British scientists are eager to offer their knowledge to you and provide assistance. The Ambassador then mentioned the great efforts made by Dr. Needham and Chinese and British researchers during the war. They assisted Chinese scientists in the free areas of China during the long war against Japan. Although Dr. Needham has returned to the UK, British scientists are still willing to assist in China's nation-building work. The Ambassador also reminded the audience that the Sino-British Cultural Committee is actively carrying out its work. In addition to providing scientific equipment and scientific and engineering periodicals to Chinese academic institutions, the Ambassador knew that the committee is also eager to assist in the excellent work of Chinese scientists.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Ambassador Shi said: I dare to assure you that because the British have also suffered from the ravages of war, they can well understand the arduous task of economic and social recovery that China is currently facing. We know your difficulties and hereby wish you success.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing] The Sajiawan Jinchuanmen area is home to many agencies such as the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Food. After the restoration, there were many children of employees, but there was no primary school, which made it very inconvenient for children to attend school. Fortunately, the Xinmin Primary School, which was founded by Sun Ke, the former Minister of Railways, etc., before the war, is still intact. After being taken over by the Executive Yuan, it appointed Zeng Dajun and Chu Zirun, two secretaries of the Yuan, to be responsible for preparing and setting up a primary school, so that the children of employees of the above-mentioned agencies could attend school. Zeng and Chu negotiated with the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Food to raise more than 20 million yuan to repair the school building and add school supplies. It has now been fully completed, but due to budget constraints, operating expenses cannot be paid. It is now heard that after negotiation with the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, the Jiangsu Provincial Jiangning Normal School Affiliated Primary School will be established. The Jiangsu Department of Education has announced that Wu Zengjie, an expert in elementary education, will be the principal. Before Wu takes office, Zhu Wenmei will temporarily act as the principal. It is scheduled to open in mid-September. The Yuan and ministries have also sent personnel to organize a committee to assist in the development of the school. It is said to be the most promising primary school in Nanjing City.</p>

<p>Dr. Pei Fei, a famous American writer and professor of international relations at Columbia University, gave a speech on "The Relationship between the Individual and the State" at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association in this city on the afternoon of the 11th. He said: The trend of government strengthening its control over economic activities is not necessarily a dangerous thing, "as long as the people retain the power to decide who is the person who makes the country successful, and change the organization of the country when they think it is appropriate." Dr. Pei Fei explained: "This means that we must have truly free choices, not pre-arranged elections. And truly free choices can only be realized with truly free criticism. Truly free choices have evolved into several things, which is the guarantee that the English-speaking people won in the first two revolutions. These things are freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of publication, whether in meetings, books, or newspapers. With these freedoms, we don't have to be afraid of the greater power of the state."</p>

<h3 id="e115">Basketball Game - Liu Zhenyuan's Basketball Skills Seem Divinely Aided - The Air Force Team Beat Dahua Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Leading All the Way with a Score of 51 to 39</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Nanjing Air Force basketball team's second game in Shanghai was held at 8 pm last night at the City Sports Center against the Dahua team. There were more spectators than in the first game, as many Air Force personnel came to watch. They were all able to purchase tickets in accordance with the regulations, which is a virtue. As a result of the game, the Air Force won the first half with 27 to 17, and the overall result was 51 to 39. Watching the Air Force's performance, there has been more progress than in the first game.</p>
<p>Air Force Progress</p>
<p>The progress is mainly in three aspects: (1) The method of marking people is not as close as in the first game, which caused fouls. It can be said that they are now at a distance of one hand and one person from the enemy's basket. (2) The reduction of long shots means more time to maintain possession of the ball, so there are also more attacks under the basket. (3) They know how to consume time. In fact, with the electric clock next to them, any player can look at the time and deal with the corresponding offense and defense. Dahua played like a scattered sand, allowing the Air Force to exert its maximum. Overall, the Air Force has been able to know how to improve, and with its excellent personal skills, it will definitely achieve better results after the third game against the Shantou team.</p>
<p>Game Highlights</p>
<p>The referees were Jin Botao and Yi Hegao. After the start, the Air Force took advantage of Dahua's unfamiliarity and launched a desperate attack. Qin Xunze scored the first goal, and the momentum became even stronger. Liu Zhenyuan's shots seemed divinely aided. Near the basket, he went straight in and was successful every time. Dahua relied on Xu Wenkui's long shots and Yang Yuanlong's follow-up, trailing behind. But the difference was always four or five balls. In the first half, the visitors led with 29 to 19. The situation remained the same in the second half. Although there were frequent personnel changes on both sides, the situation remained the same until the end of the game. The visitors finally defeated Dahua with 51 to 39.</p>

<p>Tonight at 7:45 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] As the women's and Group B volleyball teams enter the final stages of competition, each strong team is preparing themselves with full of energy. Today from 7 PM, there will be one Group B semi-final match and the second act of the women's group's round robin among the three strongest teams. In the Group B semi-final, Soviet Union B will face Shenguang. The winner will compete against Huayan Hua for the overall championship. In terms of strength, the Soviet Union team is generally more balanced than Shenguang. Shenguang's defense is not very good, especially in the third row second corner, which is vulnerable to strong attacks. Therefore, unless Shenguang's defense improves, they may be defeated.</p>
<p>In the second act of the women's group's round robin among the three strongest teams, Wuben will face Youlian. Youlian lost to their opponents in the first match, so they will strive to improve this time. In addition, they lost to Wuben in the last league match, so this is their chance for revenge. However, this reporter met Ling Qishen of Wuben yesterday, who said that because Shen Yuwen has returned to his hometown and Mu Duoyun is injured, they will continue to use veterans Zhang Biru and Li Po. With the team's familiarity, experience, and veteran players, they cannot be underestimated. It is reported that the team will wear new uniforms today, which will be a refreshing sight for the fans. The order of play today is as follows:</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Civil Affairs Bureau yesterday sent a letter to each district office stating: "The date for the centralized training of household registration personnel in this city has been determined by this bureau, and we have sent a letter for your reference and compliance. The main purpose of this centralized training is to enable household registration personnel at all levels to understand household registration laws and regulations and to correctly process the initial household registration record. Therefore, household registration personnel at all levels should deeply understand this purpose, not be reluctant to receive training, and actively prepare for the record work. In addition to the previously issued 'Regulations on Matters to be Noted in Establishing Household Registration Books After the Household Census in Shanghai,' the following fourteen key points are hereby stipulated:</p>
<p>(1) It has been a long time since the household census was conducted in this city, and there have been many changes in the population. Therefore, a careful recheck of the population before recording is essential.</p>
<p>(2) The household recheck in each district shall begin three days after the end of the training. On the day after the end of the training, the district office shall supervise each Bao to separately convene Jia chiefs to instruct them on the recheck method and the requirements for filling out the forms. (The method for filling out the forms must follow the "Instructions for Filling Out Forms for the Household Recheck Before Household Registration and Recording" compiled by the Second Section of this bureau).</p>
<p>(3) The household recheck work shall be carried out by the Bao chief and the staff of the Bao office, supervised by all the Jia chiefs, with the principle of completing it in one day, and no later than two days.</p>

<p>(5) The household recheck shall be based on the actual household situation as of the standard date for the household recheck. The household census forms originally stored in the district office shall be used as the basis for the recheck.</p>
<p>(6) The initial household registration and recording shall still be handled centrally in the district office in accordance with the regulations. During the recording process, two people shall work as a team, one recording the household registration book and the floating population registration book, and the other recording the migration registration book and statistical slips.</p>
<p>(7) The household registration book and statistical slips shall be recorded based on the household census form corrected by the "standard date for the household recheck".</p>
<p>(8) If the information recorded on the household census form does not match the actual household situation during the household recheck, the household census form shall be corrected immediately. If there is an increase in the number of households, another household census form shall be filled out and inserted. If there is no blank census form, it can be replaced with a migration application form and still inserted into the household census form. If a household has moved out, it shall be cancelled on the original form, and there is no need to fill out a "List of Households Moving Out" or a "List of Corrections to the Household Recheck."</p>
<p>(9) After a household has been rechecked, regardless of whether there are any corrections or additions, the head of the household shall affix his/her name chop to the original seal of the head of the household to show caution.</p>
<p>(10) During the household recheck, the head of each household shall be notified that if there are any matters such as migration in, migration out, birth, marriage, divorce, adoption, recognition, or death after the recheck, an application for registration shall be made in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>(11) After the household recheck, the district office shall immediately supervise each Bao to carry out the recording and, at the same time, instruct the Jia chiefs to check whether there have been any changes in the household situation within each Jia and to urge each household to apply for various registrations at any time.</p>
<p>(12) After the household recheck, all application forms for various registrations shall be submitted by the Jia chiefs to the Bao office for verification and transfer on a daily basis. The original household census forms stored in this bureau shall be issued to each Jia for safekeeping and use when the duplicate of the household registration book is sent to the bureau.</p>
<p>(13) After the household recheck, the household census form before the recording and the household registration book, migration registration book, and floating population registration book after the recording must be kept absolutely accurate. Even during the recording period, the Jia and Bao chiefs shall transfer various application forms to the district office on a daily basis, and the director of the household registration section of the district office shall be responsible for supervising the staff of each Bao to register them on a daily basis. (Households that have already been recorded shall be registered in various registration books immediately, and households that have not yet been recorded shall be registered immediately after the recording).</p>
<p>(14) The initial household registration, recording, and statistical slip recording work shall be completed within one and a half months in principle. At most, it shall not exceed two months."</p>

<h3 id="e125">Pre-War Orders: Fixed Clients Requesting Delivery According to Contracts, American Chamber of Commerce Expresses Its Attitude After Research <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Five Continents Trading Company in this city placed dozens of orders with American export firms and manufacturers on behalf of customers before the war. Due to the disruption of the war, the goods have not been delivered. Now that peace has returned and business is as usual, many customers are requesting delivery according to the contracts and are unwilling to take back their deposits. The company has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to write to the Commercial Counselor of the American Embassy to inquire about the handling of such matters and whether there are any formal methods for delivering goods according to the contracts. It is now known that the Commercial Counselor of the American Embassy has transferred the matter to the American Chamber of Commerce for research and reply. After careful consideration, the Chamber has stated its attitude towards pre-war contracts as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Responsibilities of the Seller to be Determined According to the Contract <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>(1) If the contract signed by the buyer and seller contains the customary clauses such as "Neither party shall be liable for unforeseen events, natural disasters, or man-made disasters," then the contract should be invalidated due to the outbreak of the war. However, if the buyer has prepaid a deposit and the goods are specified to be shipped from an American port, and the price includes freight and insurance, then the ownership of the goods has not been transferred to the buyer, and the latter can claim back the deposit, and the seller is responsible for returning it.</p>
<p>(2) If the buyer prepays the entire amount of the goods and the original contract stipulates delivery on board the ship, then regardless of whether the clause "Neither party shall be liable for unforeseen events, natural disasters, or man-made disasters" is included, the ownership of the goods has been transferred to the buyer. If the goods are still in the seller's possession during the war, the buyer may incur unnecessary or even total losses due to bearing storage fees and other expenses, or due to damage to the goods. Therefore, to avoid such losses, the seller may have an obligation to sell the goods at the best market price. However, the seller is only an unpaid agent and has only a slight duty to take care of the委托货品. Unless there is excessive negligence, he cannot be held liable. If the goods are sold at a good price, the seller becomes the custodian of the proceeds and should handle them in accordance with the US Government's Frozen Chinese Assets Amendment Act No. 8389. In addition, it should be noted whether the goods are manufactured specifically for the buyer, or arranged separately, with attached logos and packaging treatment. If there are no such logos or they cannot be identified, then ownership has not yet been transferred to the buyer. Even if the seller is responsible for the amount paid by the buyer, the amount should still be handled in accordance with the aforementioned Frozen Assets Act.</p>
<p>(3) If the contract does not contain the clause "Neither party shall be liable for unforeseen events, natural disasters, or man-made disasters," then the seller should fulfill the original contract. There is no express provision in the law that war invalidates all contracts between the people of enemy countries. As for the right to sue in accordance with the contract, it cannot be exercised temporarily. However, the statement that the original contract should be performed may only be limited to cases involving property rights at the time of the outbreak of the war. Generally speaking, contracts concluded by people from opposing countries are bound to involve mutual exchanges, which may lead to aiding the enemy, so they should be cancelled. As far as contracts between residents of Shanghai and the United States are concerned, since Shanghai was occupied by the enemy, local residents should be regarded as enemy nationals. Therefore, strictly speaking, the contracts between Shanghai importers and American sellers should be handled in the same way as contracts between enemy countries.</p>
<p>(4) If the contract in dispute does not involve goods, and the goods are lost in transit due to the outbreak of war after the seller delivers them to the transportation vehicle, then unless the buyer can prove that the seller was negligent in selecting the transportation vehicle, the losses incurred should be recovered from the goods insurer. As to whether compensation can be cancelled, it depends on whether the cargo was insured for war risk.</p>
<p>(5) According to our Chamber, we have read Mr. 克伍夫's book on law, in which the issue of international contracts arising from war (Chapters 19 to 21 of Volume 6) does not elaborate on the key points, but only comments on legal lawsuits between German and Allied merchants. If a lawsuit is filed due to a contract issue, the "Statute of Limitations" cannot be used as a defense. This law is invalid during wartime. The above sections are answered to your association members about resolving the pre-war contract New York questions.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Rehearsal Procedures Not Yet Skilled, Stock Exchange Decides to Postpone Opening Auction, To Facilitate Brokers, Market Board Records Will Be Improved <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Stock Exchange continued its trading, settlement, and reconciliation procedures yesterday morning and afternoon. The morning rehearsal of trading went well because of the simpler nature. Due to the failure of the previous day, yesterday's rehearsal of settlement and reconciliation was conducted in groups. Each group consisted of twelve people, and Yang Yinpu, the assistant manager of the Stock Exchange, personally supervised the training. The process took only one and a half hours, and all accounts were reconciled. The Stock Exchange authorities believe that the rehearsal process has improved significantly compared to the previous day. It is reported that group rehearsals of settlement and reconciliation procedures will continue throughout the day yesterday to achieve proficiency. Brokers also reportedly feel the same way. Therefore, the scheduled opening auction date of the 12th will be postponed.</p>
<p>In addition, the Stock Exchange authorities have now decided to accept some suggestions from brokers and make improvements: (1) The distance between the eastern and western corridors and the blackboard is too great, and the handwriting is difficult to read. It has now been decided to double the size of the handwriting. The transaction price will be written temporarily, and the bid and ask prices may be added in the future if needed. (2) To facilitate brokers, blackboards will also be set up in each trading hub to display the transaction and bid and ask prices of each stock.</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange recently sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting instructions on two points: (1) Please promulgate the transaction tax collection methods as soon as possible. (2) Please provide instructions on the regulations for substitutes for margin deposits.</p>
<p>In addition, some of the 20 securities approved for listing are undergoing registration changes, and temporary receipts are being issued for the stocks. It is reported that the Stock Exchange, in consideration of the actual difficulties, has temporarily allowed the pre-arranged transfer of these temporary receipts.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Listed Prices and Allotments Remain Unchanged, Cotton Yarn Sales Already Saturated, Yarn Numbers Applied For Either Not Allotted or Reduced by Half, All Processing Factories Allotted According to the Number Applied For <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The yarn market yesterday was not as strong as before. In addition to the usual sales by the Textile and Construction Company, the private yarn mills' joint allotment association also dumped a large amount of cotton yarn. Customers were unable to absorb it due to continuous purchases in recent days, and the Guangdong merchants' buying appetite was temporarily saturated. The local yarn numbers reportedly had a universal opportunity to be allotted, and they were also waiting and watching. Therefore, the yarn prices in the early market only remained strong for 16-count yarn, which was as high as 20,000 yuan, and 10-count yarn was also firm. The rest all fell. 42-count Blue Phoenix, the Shanghai warehouse bill price was quoted at 2.38 million, but the Wusong pier bill was only trading at 2.33 million. 32-count Blue Phoenix, packaged at 1.69 million. 32-count Xiantao cone tube, 1.6 million. 20-count Blue Phoenix, then quoted at 1.34 million. The number of transactions was not enthusiastic. The Textile and Construction Company opened 24 types of 42-count and other brands yesterday, and the prices remained the same, but the number firms were not allotted at all. 42-count Sunlight was allotted to the knitting industry (from No. 241 to No. 303), 32-count Five-Star was allotted to dyeing and weaving, and 20-count Magpie was allotted to towels, underwear, dyeing and weaving, and handkerchiefs (from No. 1 to No. 240). The yarn allotted by the private yarn mills' joint allotment association did not specify prices when it was listed at 11:00 AM. General factory numbers said that yarn prices might need to be adjusted. In addition, after the private mills opened yarn, they had to advance funds for more than half a month before they could get the actual goods, so those who requested purchases were very few. After the private mills announced the allotment prices at 5:00 PM, 20-count Fengnian was still at 1.16 million, 20-count Colorful Ball 1.16 million, 32-count Blue Phoenix 1.56 million, and 42-count Blue Phoenix 1.9 million, for a total of 2,050 pieces. It was also reported that all processing factories that requested purchases were allotted according to the number applied for, while yarn numbers were allotted half the amount. According to people in the industry, if the Textile and Construction Company can implement this allotment method continuously without interruption, then the decline in yarn prices is inevitable.</p>
<p>(Cotton Cloth Allotment Too Small, Black Market Still Difficult to Eliminate) The cloth market was slightly flat yesterday. Blue V-character, because cotton cloth merchants from No. 1 to No. 149, only opened one package per house, and the rest were returned, so the market price still had those who added 6,000 to 6,500 yuan to collect. Serge old goods, has not been opened twice, the price is still standing at 63,000 yuan. The Textile and Construction Company's quoted price for 12-pound unbranded fine cloth fell by 500 yuan, and few cotton cloth numbers applied to purchase this product, because those who opened it last time mostly sold it at reduced prices and there was no profit to be made, so they were all at a loss. As for the Blue V-character cloth applied for by the dyeing and weaving factories, each factory was allotted 40 pieces, and the unbranded fine cloth was allotted according to the order. However, in general, the market is upward-looking, and if the Textile and Construction Company wants to eliminate the black market, it is still not enough to open the goods, because things are valued when they are scarce. Since there are few allotments, the black market is inevitable.</p>

<p>The over-the-counter trading of Chinese stocks was slightly affected because the Stock Exchange could not resume trading quickly. After opening, it gradually fell back, initially high and then low, with small stocks being the most sluggish in the middle. However, it rebounded slightly near the close, and unpopular stocks were also passively dragged down slightly. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsha, Meyer, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qin Xing, and other stocks fell by about half a percentage point. Among the less popular stocks, medium-sized stocks fell slightly, and small stocks rebounded by half a percentage point to one percentage point. The veteran stocks saw minimal gains and losses.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to be weak, but there were not many transactions, and the process was stagnant. Except for Steel Industry and Xiangtai, the rest of the stocks all fell slightly, and the trend was difficult to change drastically. As a result, compared with the previous close, Xiangtai rose slightly, Steel Industry remained flat, and the rest all fell slightly.</p>

<p>Since the ban on exports of white coal blocks from Tianjin, arrivals have decreased sharply. Holders of goods treat them as treasures, and the quoted prices have risen frequently.

<h3 id="e132">Authorities Adopt Stabilization Policy, Food Crisis Has Passed, Taiwanese Rice Arrives in Force and No Longer Dependent on Foreign Rice <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] I interviewed Ji Mingqi, the section chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. According to him, the food crisis in this city has passed, and it will enter a better state in the future. Mayor Wu humbly stated at the Municipal Council the other day that the rice policy had failed, but in reality, he only meant that the promotion of brown rice policy had failed. The most serious period of the food crisis in this city was in late June. According to the survey on June 24, the city's rice industry only had 12,840 石 of rice in stock, which was estimated to only supply the city for a few days, and the source was extremely scarce. At that time, the Social Affairs Bureau had no choice but to adopt a distribution policy to regulate it. In order to achieve universal supply, regardless of the size of the rice store, after being certified by the industry association, they could apply for distribution, with a limit of 10 bags. This was out of factual necessity. Afterwards, the source of foreign rice was open, and the rice ordered from other places also arrived at the port one after another. The amount of rice in the hands of the bureau was relatively abundant, so it issued a sales method. All rice numbers were allowed to apply freely. Supply was provided as much as possible, and the rice price was stabilized. From July 4 to September 4. The bureau sold a total of 82,014 石 and 9 斗 of various grains. According to Ji Section Chief, the current amount of rice in stock is extremely large and can be supplied without restriction. Regarding rice prices, the government hopes to cooperate with general prices, not to rise high, nor to fall sharply, because high rises affect people's livelihood, and sharp falls are harmful to the countryside. Mayor Wu has a principle of hoping that the medium rice price will not exceed 46,000 yuan. Ji Section Chief also said that Taiwan's rice production is very abundant, with three harvests a year. In addition to supplying Taiwan's people with food. A large amount can also be exported. If Taiwanese rice is imported into this city, then the people of this city will no longer have to rely on foreign rice for food. The first batch of Taiwanese rice arrived at the port today. In the future, it will also arrive in a steady stream. It is also learned that: if the rice source is smooth and the rice price is too low, the government also plans to buy it.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Gold Price Rebounds, US Dollar Steady <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's raw gold was still stable. It opened at 2.143 million in the morning. After opening, it started from 2.146 million, and the situation was uncertain. It first retreated to 2.135 million, and the Central Bank distributed 116 bars at this price. After 10:00 AM, the situation eased, and it gradually rebounded to 2.15 million, with a slight pressure. Near noon, it retreated to 2.133 million again. Those with ample funds absorbed it slightly. At noon, it rebounded to above 2.15 million again. Then, after the transaction of the next day continued to rise to above 2.16 million, and then it settled slightly. As a result, it rebounded 23,000 compared to the previous day. Jewelry gold was 29,000, pure silver was flat, and silver yuan fell slightly. The shadow interest rate was not loose, and the interest rate ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 角.</p>
<p>The foreign currency US dollar was still stable. It opened at 3,420 yuan for sale in the morning. It retreated to 3,390 yuan in the middle. It was still stable between 3,400 yuan and 3,420 yuan at noon. There was a lack of special changes. It was still struggling in the original place in the afternoon. As a result, it had no honor or disgrace compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollar initially flat and then stable. As a result, it also rose by 10 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rate was also the same. It was around 680 yuan at first, and it rose slightly to around 690 yuan near noon. Indian exchange rate was 830 yuan to 840 yuan at first, and then 820 yuan to 830 yuan. British exchange rate was 1,105 yuan for supply, and US exchange rate was around the listed price.</p>
<h3 id="e134">City Chamber of Commerce Again Cables Request: Business Tax Collected Based on Tiered System; Flexible Provisions in Tax Law Originally Allow for Adjustment; Revision of Detailed Regulations Does Not Require Legislative Procedure <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The City Chamber of Commerce, regarding the matter of business tax being collected based on tiered system by industry, recently sent another cable to the Ministry of Finance with suggestions. The original cable stated roughly: Upon investigation, based on suggestions from various industries under the association, regarding the request to collect business tax based on tiered system by industry, your ministry's approval contained the statement; the request to determine tax tiers based on industry classification is still acceptable and should be kept for reference when the Business Tax Law is amended in the future. Upon investigation, the Business Tax Law was just amended and promulgated on April 16th of this year. Since it involves legislative procedures, repeated requests for modification are not easy. Your ministry's approval, stating "amended in the future," is difficult to predict in terms of time. However, the urgent need for reasonable adjustment of business tax rates for various industries is a matter of utmost urgency. Article 4, Category 1 of this Business Tax Law, which uses the total business income as the standard, levies 1% to 3%. Although the tax law does not have tiered measures, the range of 1% to 3% leaves room for tiered collection. Currently, business taxes in various provinces and cities are collected by local governments according to the revised financial revenue and expenditure system, allowing local governments to adapt to local conditions and stipulate regulations in separate chapters. However, Article 14 of the Detailed Regulations for the Implementation of the Business Tax Law, promulgated on August 16th, states that other industries shall uniformly levy 1.5% of their total business income. The original flexible provisions of Article 4, Category 1 of the Business Tax Law, which allowed provinces and cities to determine tiered collection, are now subject to the rigid provisions of the detailed regulations. The uniform approach prevents provinces and cities from formulating separate chapters to achieve flexibility and maximize benefits, which contradicts the original intention of your ministry's approval, which stated that it was still acceptable. The revision of the Detailed Regulations for the Implementation of the Business Tax Law is easier to handle than the Business Tax Law, which requires legislative procedures. It is suggested that your ministry submit a request to the Executive Yuan to revise Article 14 of the Detailed Regulations to allow provinces and cities to determine the business tax rate on a tiered basis within the statutory range of Article 4 of the Business Tax Law when drafting separate chapters for the collection of business tax. Then your ministry's approval No. 1815, which stated that it was "still acceptable," can be implemented without going through the legislative procedures of amending the Business Tax Law, which seems easier to handle and can comfort the merchants' hopes earlier. We sincerely hope that your ministry will immediately adopt and implement it.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Modern International Organization Theory and Method <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Fan</p>
<p>G. Delisle Burns believes that modern civilization, from economic, political, and cultural perspectives, relies entirely on continuous communication between nations to form a close-knit organization. However, the understanding of this new state of economic life is still stuck in old patterns. Many people still believe that culture is a local product; the application of the League of Nations system cannot escape the scope of old-fashioned diplomacy. This is because countries have not developed an "international mentality." Therefore, he wrote a book, "Modern International Organization Theory and Method," to create an "international mentality," which has recently been translated into Chinese and is sold by the Commercial Press.</p>
<p>It first talks about the economic aspect: the higher the modern standard of living, the greater the usefulness of the international organization of goods supply; at least in terms of economic function, national borders may be abolished. Secondly, from a cultural perspective: the development of science and art depends on frequent contact with other countries. Although the roots of modern culture in various places are still national and racial, its brilliant flowers must be international. Thirdly, from a political perspective: modern countries cannot fulfill their responsibilities to their own people without cooperating with other countries; the administrative organs of each country, such as commerce, industry, transportation, finance, health, and education, must cooperate with similar organs in other countries. Therefore, the art of governance is decreasing in terms of defense and increasing in terms of international organization. The concept of defense inevitably leads any country that considers itself good to regard expanding its territory as the best way to defend itself. As long as this concept of defending other countries' governments as necessary for any country exists, potential enemies will inevitably exist. As long as there is suspicion of a certain country's government as a potential enemy, it will poison all international communication and prevent the modernization of the State system. The modern country is fundamentally "a part of a single government occupying the globe"—therefore, each government is purely a tool for its people to help the people of other countries; detective work and other war preparations have become obsolete concepts.</p>
<p>According to Burns' argument, the currently popular principles of sovereignty and nationalism naturally cannot stand at all. If the people of all countries can develop such a trusting international mentality, the "world state" that idealists desire will not be difficult to achieve. What war is there? Not only can disarmament be implemented immediately, but even international police do not need to be organized on a large scale. Wouldn't that be a great fortune for mankind? Unfortunately, the facts tell us the complete opposite!</p>
<p>Just from an economic point of view, since the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century, capital has increased with productivity. The domestic market is not enough to supply its development and has to seek markets abroad, and "world communication" has also developed with it. Then, the countries that have risen up are unwilling to endure this kind of economic aggression, so they advocate nationalism to resist it. Those whose forces are evenly matched use nationalism to compete for hegemony. As a result, the economics of nationalism arose in response to the times after the orthodox free economy. As the economic struggle intensified, the political struggle also intensified, and the idea that war is a political tool became a creed for politicians for a time. As a result, the First World War broke out. After the war, the great powers not only did not regret the disaster, but the so-called "balance of power" and "armed peace" remained the core of international politics. Wilson's highly proclaimed Fourteen Points were not actually implemented at all; and the so-called "economic nationalism" was regarded as the golden rule of economic policy. The League of Nations is just a tool for the great powers to use each other; those who do not want to be used form another bloc to fight against each other. As a result, the Second World War broke out again. As many as seventy countries were drawn into the whirlpool of war, with 40 to 50 million military and civilian casualties, and more than 100 billion U.S. dollars spent. The disaster was far greater than the first. After such a catastrophe, logically, we should correct our past mistakes. But did the great powers abide by the Atlantic Charter announced in August 1942? Were the promises of non-expansion, non-unilateral alteration of territory, and non-interference in internal affairs fulfilled? The organization of the United Nations seems to be more advanced than the League of Nations on the surface, but what is the difference between the veto power of the five powers and the provision of unanimous resolutions by the Executive Council of the League of Nations? Aren't the frictions and conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union even more superficial than those between Britain and France in those years? Isn't the old tune of "balance of power" and "armed peace" sung in the nineteenth century still popular there? The number of national defense budgets is much larger than in the League of Nations era; no one even mentions the high-sounding tune of disarmament!</p>
<p>Under such international circumstances, what science, art, and education cannot but be used as a means of selfish nationalism or class struggle. It goes without saying that Germany, which claims to be the "ruling nation," what about other countries that pride themselves on being civilized and advanced, who do not regard promoting their own culture as their responsibility? Therefore, in addition to political aggression and economic aggression, there is also so-called cultural aggression. Now, the socialist country group led by the Soviet Union and the democratic country group led by the United States of America are preventing cultural aggression from each other, like epidemic prevention. Although the Soviet Union has joined the United Nations, it refused to participate in the Agricultural and Food Conference of the UN Committee, what are we talking about cultural exchange and cultural cooperation!</p>
<p>Why are there such different views on the same kind of "world communication"? Why do some think it can promote international peace, while others think it can promote international war? Why is it that international peace is still a fantasy, while promoting international war has become a reality? In the final analysis, it still has to be attributed to the traditional Western view of life. The traditional Western view of life is a thoroughly struggle-based view of life. This view of life should be applied to politics, which is power politics. Today, politics dominates everything, and economics and culture cannot but be its appendages. Even religion is sometimes used by it as a means. The result of power politics is nothing but war. The slogan of war is always said to be for sovereignty and for the nation-state. The "principle of sovereignty," which is the essence of nationalism, is a hypothesis from the European Renaissance. Like Huang Feihu in "Investiture of the Gods" and Sun Wukong, the Monkey King in "Journey to the West," there was no such monster originally, but later someone used propaganda, and temples were built and worshiped everywhere; and the East Mountain Emperor City God Temple is still listed in the sacrificial canon, and the county magistrate has to kowtow and burn incense to it every month? In the eyes of the enlightened, it is really absurd and ridiculous, almost making people laugh. However, everyone says so, and everyone worships it, who will believe you if you say it is fake?</p>
<p>Even Burns himself, according to this book, cannot but be deeply constrained by Western social thought. Because the social thought formed by the Western view of life is purely utilitarian; they believe that nothing that is not worth competing for because it is not profitable cannot arouse interest. Therefore, his argument for world peace based on "world communication" treats the economies, cultures, and politics of various countries as having "exchange value." This theory based on "exchange value" still cannot avoid the petty bourgeois thought of calculating private interests. Everyone knows that people who rush to be the first to seek profit will become estranged when their interests are exhausted, or even harm each other; such international friends cannot be relied on. Even if everything goes according to his wishes and an ordinary "international mentality" is created, I am afraid it will still not be able to promote international peace; I am afraid that the more international communication there is, the faster and more international wars will be! Because the life philosophy of fighting for power and profit is not fundamentally corrected, war is unavoidable. Only by using the Confucian "view of life of benevolence and righteousness" to cultivate an "international mentality" and correct this mistake can the "single government system occupying the globe" be realized, and world peace can have the final guarantee. The theory of benevolence and righteousness: just looking at the surface, it seems to be somewhat aimless; in fact, "righteousness is the root of profit," and there is no result that is not beneficial! It is a pity that such a noble-minded person as Burns still cannot but circle within the old utilitarian paradigm, and does not know that persuading peace with the theory of benevolence and righteousness is more far-reaching and effective. However, when the world is talking about struggle, and is talking about it in a dizzy state, Burns' book is undoubtedly a rare and valuable clearing agent.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Review of "Middle School Music Teaching Materials" <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Dinghe</p>
<p>Published by the Music Education Association, Distributed by China Bookstore, Fuzhou Road</p>
<p>For many years, many friends who teach music in middle schools have often asked me to recommend books and music teaching materials. Because no new teaching materials have been published in the rear in recent years, I have only selected some songs for them sporadically. I myself also feel that this method of introduction is really unsystematic, and it also lacks various teaching materials other than songs. I have been thinking in my heart that there should be a complete set of teaching materials to remedy the shortage of teaching materials. I myself also have the intention to try to compile one, but: (1) my learning is shallow, and (2) I lack reference books, so I put it aside.</p>
<p>I didn't expect that the gentlemen of the Music Education Association had already had this idea without prior consultation, and they started to compile this "Middle School Music Teaching Materials" six years ago. I only recently got the news, and immediately borrowed the original manuscript from the editors. After reading it, I felt that these three volumes of teaching materials (divided into upper, middle, and lower volumes) are the most ideal teaching materials. I believe that not long after publication, the music level of Chinese secondary schools will definitely be greatly improved, and it will meet the standard. Indirectly, Chinese music education will also be affected by this book to be popularized and improved.</p>
<p>So, where are the advantages of these teaching materials?</p>
<p>Simply put: it emphasizes equally on music theory, singing, and appreciation. The order of the songs is based on the difficulty of the music, and even more on the order of the seasons and the era of the composers, so that students can make progress imperceptibly. That is to say: imperceptibly, they can have a clear memory of the history of music, the form of music, and the composers and their styles of each era. Moreover, the songs selected in this book have beautiful melodies, complete structures, and appropriate ranges. The lyrics, melodies, and rhythms are all very suitable.</p>
<p>It is quite difficult to use the above advantages as the principle of editing. But these authors did it, and they did it. They wrote it seriously based on many years of teaching experience (for this reason, even if it is only a few faint sentences in the material, they have also referred to many books, and even some come from lengthy biographies.) The original manuscript has been revised and reorganized many times, and now it is about to be published, which cannot but make people admire. They have a serious scholarly attitude, and if you see these teaching materials, you will definitely feel the same.</p>
<p>In these three books, you have no way to see the names of any of the editors. Although the translators and authors of many lyrics were translated or written by someone among the editors, they all used "editor" to come forward. And I heard that in the original manuscript there were many songs that were the works of the editors, but now they are purely editing from the objective attitude of music education, and all those songs have been cancelled. These are all explanations of their serious scholarly attitude. However, I still want to expose it a bit: one of the editors is Mr. Qian Renkang. If you have ever browsed through the book "Music Theory and Composition" (originally written by Prestonware Orem) translated by Jin Shiting and published by Zhonghua Book Company, you will find that the translator's name has some of the same relationship as Mr. Qian's name. That book was printed ten years ago, which shows that Mr. Qian's serious scholarly attitude has always been consistent. Using this attitude to edit teaching materials, students will also be greatly influenced imperceptibly.</p>
<p>However, this set of teaching materials has a shortcoming, that is, the font of the printing plate is too small, which is harmful to students' eyesight. It is hoped that a larger font can be used in the future.</p>
<p>However, in any case, this "Middle School Music Teaching Materials" is a book that is very worthy of recommendation. Because: it not only completed my "try to compile one" for me personally (this is in terms of me personally), but also not only remedied the regret of the shortage of teaching materials in schools, and it is also a powerful new force in the entire Chinese music education.</p>

<p>"Those who study for the imperial examinations read various scriptures, only arranging them for use as materials for current essays, without any interference with themselves. Therefore, what they temporarily use to advance themselves are all the dregs of the ancients, and what they obtain throughout their lives to do things are all the innate habits. It is truly what is called 'books are books, and I am I,' what is the difference from those who do not study?" (Reading Records)</p>
<p>— Xue Jingxuan</p>
<p>"When discussing learning with people, one must also follow the limits of what people can reach. If a tree has these buds, just use this water to irrigate them; when the buds grow longer, add more water. From the size of a handful to the size of an embrace, the merit of irrigation can be followed to the extent that one can reach. If there is a bucket of water for small buds, try to pour it all out, it will rot them." (Records of Practice)</p>
<p>— Wang Yangming</p>
<p>"Whenever people use effort to read books, whether examining names and objects or studying righteousness and reason, when it is complicated and difficult to understand, or when thoughts are exhausted, put down the books and walk around in an open space. Suddenly, thoughts are triggered, and you suddenly understand. There is an unpredicted and natural solution. This is a wonderful way to explore the truth. Or when you are determined to work hard behind closed doors for three winters and two summers, and your belly is full of poems, books, righteousness, and reason, but you come out to walk around for a day or two, you really feel that the water is flowing, the flowers are blooming, the clouds are moving, and the birds are flying. The whole sky is a lively scene. This is the realm that Mencius called life. You don't know whether your hands are dancing or your feet are dancing." (Thoughts on Learning the Great Learning)</p>

<h3 id="e139">An Overview of the Patent System <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mudan Review</p>
<p>Written by Qin Hongji, Published by Commercial Press, Chongqing Edition, September 1945</p>
<p>The modern patent system was established in the British Monopoly Act (1623), and it has only been more than 300 years now. Among various systems, it is relatively new. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the government has repeatedly promulgated various regulations to encourage industrial technology, but it has never established an invention patent management agency. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the lack of materials, in order to seek self-sufficiency and increase the strength of the Anti-Japanese War, the encouragement of industrial technology has been closely watched by government leaders and social elites. It is sincerely believed that the progress of industry depends on the exchange of technology between countries. In industrially backward countries, in order to catch up, it is appropriate to use the patent system to strengthen the absorption of the latest inventions from abroad. In May 1944, the National Government officially promulgated the Patent Law, hoping to implement it within one or two years after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. However, the patent system is still a new creation in China, and important issues such as (1) the theory of the patent system (2) the main points of China's Patent Law (3) how inventors should apply for patents and how to ensure their rights and interests (4) how manufacturing plants should make good use of patent rights, etc., are not fully understood by many technical experts. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the implementation of the Patent Law is imminent, and contact between China's industrial and commercial circles and European and American factories is frequent, and there is often the possibility of involving patent issues. In the past, there was no kind of publication in China that could meet this need, and Mr. Qin Hongji's book just made up for this shortcoming.</p>
<p>The author is an engineer who has served as a senior technical officer in the Ministry of Economy and has been in charge of administrative work for many years, making him the most suitable candidate for compiling this book. The original manuscript was also rewarded by the Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education in accordance with the "Regulations on Rewarding Works, Inventions, and Works of Art." Chapters 1 to 2 of the book provide a general description of the origin and evolution of the patent system, as well as the evolution of China's patent system. Chapters 3 to 6 discuss in detail the inventions that can be patented, as well as the nature of inventions, new types, and new patterns. Chapters 7 to 9 describe the main points of applying for patents and the examination procedures of patent agencies. Chapters 10 to 14 discuss the validity, infringement, implementation, and the distribution of rights and interests between labor and capital. Chapters 15 to 17 describe the content of the "International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property," as well as the current laws and regulations of important industrial countries.</p>
<p>This book was published in Chongqing, and it may be available in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places now. After reading it, the author can make four statements: (1) The whole book is carefully selected and rich in materials. Some domestic statistics and explanations have not been publicly published. The foreign precedents and court rulings cited are not easy to find. The sources are noted at the end of the chapter for reference. (2) The whole book uses an objective attitude. Regarding the interpretation of laws, the original text of "precedents" or "explanations" is used as much as possible, without making empty statements. (3) The specifications required for applying for a patent are extremely important, regardless of the policy adopted by the country, whether it is the examination principle or the inventor's rights principle. The original book is summarized and can be called complete, but if more actual examples can be cited, it will be more beneficial to general industrial and commercial readers. (4) Although China's Patent Law has been promulgated, it has not yet been implemented. The original book only explains the current laws and regulations separately regarding the application procedures. In the future, the implementing regulations of the Patent Law and the organizational law of the Patent Office and other relevant laws and regulations will be successively promulgated, and some parts of the original book need to be supplemented urgently. It is heard that the author has left the administrative work and has been hired as an engineer. It is still hoped that he will revise it again in the next edition to make it complete.</p>

<p>—Exposing the Plagiarism of the Ancients</p>
<p>I learned Kunqu Opera to play the roles of young male and ugly female. Someone recommended "Visiting Su" from "The Story of the Red Pear," saying that this play was good to listen to. After I learned it, the role of "I" was indeed not bad, the tunes were smooth and pleasing to the ear, so I often hummed the tunes in it:</p>
<p>(Yichun Ling) A nature for romance, an intestines of cloud and rain, naturally mad about flowers and willows. The new lyrics are delicate, and the pretty name is worthy of competing with Qiu Niang. Su Xiaoxiao is equally talented and beautiful, and Lü Shuangshuang is no less romantic. Risking getting drunk with beautiful women in brocade zithers, green screens, and red curtains.</p>
<p>(Previous Tune) Wei Niang's face, a magistrate's intestines, secret feelings of the heart, snuggling up to each other since buying [her]. (Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Previous Tune) Just because of the beauty of her face and the jade appearance, facing death, they invasively invite her to seek the phoenix. (Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Putian Le) Just hoping to stir up clouds and rain in Wushan's barrier. (Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Jin Jidao) Mistakenly identified as King Xiang of Chu. (Excerpt)</p>
<p>I accidentally flipped through Volume 4 of the "Yongxi Yuefu" and saw the suite by an anonymous author from the Yuan or early Ming Dynasty. Only then did I realize that Xu Fuzuo's "Visiting Su" was actually copied from this suite. I hereby record it in full, and mark the identical words and sentences with black circles on both sides:</p>
<p>(Dian Jiangchun) Moon-lit windows and cloud-like doors, green screens and red curtains. In the brothel, there is a delicate red makeup, the beauty of which is truly worthy of appreciation.</p>
<p>(Hunjiang Long) In the lane of Wo-ke, the pretty name occupies the brothel. Songs are sung about gold threads, dances are watched with rainbow skirts, talent and beauty surpass Su Xiaoxiao, romance is no less than Lü Shuangshuang. Listening to the gentle singing, it is like flowers understanding speech, like jade producing fragrance.</p>
<p>(Shan Ronglu) Apricot faces and peach cheeks with palace-style makeup, walking on silk socks as cool as ripples, truly a song of spring breeze by Du Wei Niang. Looking at this shy flower and closing moon charming appearance, I cannot understand the illusion of stirring up clouds and rain. Arrange a false sincerity, use some clever tricks, hide the deception of the young men and the瞒天谎, the appearance is very dignified.</p>
<p>(Tianxia Le) Doesn't that bother the intestines of the Suzhou magistrate, Sima should not be commonplace. If King Xiang of Chu saw it, he would also have a laborious dream. How can he withstand her touching green eyebrows, her soul-stirring cloud-like hair, let alone her captivating smile.</p>
<p>(Jinzhan'er) Leaning against the east wall, close to the west wing, talented scholars and beautiful women are often close to each other. How can the secret feelings of the heart be forgotten?引惹的崔生频觅浆,逼临的韩寿偷香,因此上楼迟风月所,留恋在雨云儿鄕。</p>
<p>(Tail Sound) In the heart, I think, I'm afraid I can't say that the face of the year is just fragrant, I'm just afraid that people's hearts will not last long. Look for the painted pavilion and orchid hall early, but the phoenix has flown away. How can you not consider it? Looking back at the starry rain temples, you will miss the floating clouds covering the moon, and the flowers will wither in the violent wind, in which the bees and butterflies sell their good spring?</p>
<p>Approximately, Xu Fuzuo's "The Story of the Red Pear" likes to plagiarize other people's works. "The Pavilion Meeting" uses a lot of the second act of Zhang Shouqing's "Red Pear Flower Zaju" from the Yuan Dynasty. "The Flower Woman" plagiarizes even more from the third act of "Red Pear Flower."</p>
<h3 id="e141">Memories of Plum Blossoms <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Zi</p>
<p>My love for plum blossoms is, undeniably, a kind of deep attachment. When I was little, I didn't pay much attention to plum blossoms, only feeling that they had a clear, cold fragrance that made one yearn for them. We used to live in a remote county, and outside my bedroom window there happened to be two ancient plum trees. Sometimes, just as the sky was beginning to brighten, the snow on the ground would illuminate the window panes with a white glow; yet on the white window paper were dark shadows, just like plum blossoms painted with light ink. At this time, half-dreaming and half-awake, I would only feel a rush of clear, cold fragrance that intoxicated me, as if reality was mixed with dreams.</p>
<p>Three years ago, when I was twenty, I happened to buy a collection of poems by Lin Bu. This collection also had a clear, cold style, like plum blossoms. Among them, there were especially many poems praising plum blossoms, and I read these poems over and over until I could recite them. I felt that Lin Bu's love for plum blossoms was also a kind of deep attachment, perhaps because Lin Bu's love was too delicate, too profound, and he couldn't find a girl in this world who could understand him, so he took plum blossoms as his wife and cranes as his children. Although he was a noble hermit, he was so deeply infatuated. He often told the plum blossoms his foolish thoughts, loved them, praised them, to the point of being unable to control himself. The plum blossom, having found such a confidant, should have added a touch of redness to its pure white petals.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because I was influenced by something, but I also began to love plum blossoms; although my personality was not as noble and elegant as Lin Bu's, emotionally, I was also sentimental. I recited Lin Bu's poems again and again, feeling a kind of secret, secluded emotion that made one intoxicated. A kind of longing grew in my heart, loving plum blossoms, thinking about plum blossoms, and finally encountering plum blossoms.</p>
<p>That autumn, at university, I met a beautiful girl—beautiful in her purity, beautiful in her elegance, beautiful in her pitiableness. Her name was Mei (Plum), perhaps she was the soul of the plum blossom? I will never forget the bewilderment I felt the first time I saw her. Her even features, her slender figure, and her gentle, pure spirit combined to create a perfect, yet not very practical person. At least in this bustling world, she could be called a miracle. I couldn't help but feel the pent-up enthusiasm in my heart, and I said to myself: "Now you have truly encountered plum blossoms, these plum blossoms will not wither, not only in your heart, but also before your eyes, how should you cherish this beautiful moment!" This beautiful moment truly arrived: endless love, countless dreams. But it was only a short year, this kind of delicate love was suffocating, so suffocating that I couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, and also because of my devotion to beauty, I left Mei, leaving her with tears in my eyes. I became a pitiful martyr for beauty! After that, I continued to live in the bustling world, encountering many beautiful girls, just like encountering many beautiful flowers, but no matter what, I would not love them, I could no longer love, my love had already been buried with the memory of plum blossoms. From then on, I would always use tears to irrigate it, irrigate this beautiful flower—perhaps a plum blossom woven from emotion and imagination!</p>
<p>But why am I so stubborn! In this world of ten thousand purples and thousands of reds, I only love plum blossoms, and after being touched by this tragic memory, all the plum blossoms seem to me to be able to understand my words.</p>
<p>However, my heart has changed a little, not changed, but suppressed. I have already decided to be an ordinary person, putting all my energy into my career, to make myself forget everything. Or else I will go to places of entertainment to walk around, to seek stimulation, to seek anesthesia. But no matter how depraved my life becomes, this memory of plum blossoms must still be "placed in a crystal bottle, held with both hands."</p>
<p>A few days ago, a relative mentioned Mei again, it turned out they knew each other. She only knew that Mei was a beautiful girl who used to be my classmate. She hoped that we would meet again. She said it so calmly, but she didn't know how much pain it stirred up in my heart. Years of living against my will have buried all my pain and joy, and I don't want any new fluctuations. I can't think, I dare not think, how should I think? If we still have a day of reunion, facing each other!</p>
<p>I can only steel my heart to prevent this possible happiness, perhaps possible pain! Let this memory of plum blossoms keep its clarity in my heart! After the washing of the years, after the destruction of wind, frost, rain, and snow, it is still so vivid, so profound. This source of mystery will never dry up. I am willing to do my best to create a crystal world for plum blossoms, where there is no pain, no annoyance. The plum blossoms there are tinted with red, and the sunshine shining on the plum blossoms is eternal.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Tears <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Huai</p>
<p>Tears run through my intertwined years, repeatedly soaking my own sorrows and some joyous laughter…</p>
<p>Often in the deep night, deep thought draws my tearful gaze to the tears of the sky outside the window. The leaden, dust-laden mood also shifts to the vastness of the spirit! Especially when the dripping rain of starless, eternal nights repeatedly plucks at the hidden tear stains, in the resonance, it often touches off two new streams.</p>
<p>Perhaps friends always see me plunging into the springs of tears with a weak posture; but I am unwilling to have them inquire about my release of these bitter juices. (Although there is also a hint of grape flavor…) I would rather savor the taste alone in solitude.</p>
<p>But I can similarly dig out some of life's truths. Tears are to life as the earth's summer heat is washed clean and cool by a torrential rain; the lotus leaves in the pond, before the sudden clearing, are cleansed to be refreshing. I believe: in the sins, cruelty, ambition, tyranny, and grimacing faces of this world, their tears will not naturally flow. And a truly unadorned tear can be used to examine one's own life, like a small grass flower accepting the dew's moisture to welcome the morning sun and strengthen its vitality!</p>
<p>When I see an innocent child with two small lanterns hanging on their pure face; a decrepit saintly mother flickering with her compassionate light; a group of homeless people silently pleading with unconsoleable crystal beads for their lives, and those soldiers shedding loyal and brave nectar; the strivers silently enduring all the frustrations in tears… Ah! Although they are all less than the reality of blood and the strength of iron, they are far beyond those shameless smiles!…</p>
<p>Tears—let them flow naturally! Rely on this innate instinct to wash one's own hands at the pillow, the desk, the deep mountains and great marshes, then drip them on the stubborn instep, then pick them up and cherish them in the plate of one's life. In the deep dark tunnel, in the night, in the boundless, gloomy earth, look at the shining light, illuminating your path forward!</p>
<h3 id="e143">Autumn Talk <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Shangqing</p>
<p>Another year has passed easily, and it is once again the cool autumn season of falling wutong leaves; as I have gotten older, I have become particularly concerned about the seasons. When I was a child, every early autumn, I would follow some wild children to catch crickets by the walls and corners of the house, patrolling the wilderness every night, the lamplight and people's faces still seem like yesterday when I think about them. My father was a muddleheaded bug who drank all day and didn't care about anything else. Every autumn evening, with drunken eyes, he would point to the sky, saying that one was Uranus, Neptune, and that one was the Milky Way, and then sigh about his own old age, which was now full of emptiness and loneliness like autumn.</p>
<p>According to Chinese poets, autumn symbolizes middle age, with wind howling, trees bare, and yellow leaves falling, a desolate scene that is indeed different from spring and summer. Historically, sensitive poets, living in this kind of situation, although grieving over their own lives, could only say "silently seeing off spring"; moreover, after "tearful eyes questioning the flowers, the falling red flies past the swing," how could they chew on "last night the west wind withered the green trees, alone I climbed the high building to gaze at the end of the sky"? So all that was left was: "lifting the curtain to face the west wind, people are thinner than yellow flowers"; moreover, how many lovelorn men and women have watched spring turn into summer, summer turn into autumn, thinking of home, cherishing the past, people are not made of wood or stone, who can be without emotion, so they do not hesitate to: "my clothes grow wider, I do not regret it, for her I grow haggard."</p>
<p>Xin Youan has a poem "Ugly Slave," describing the psychology of young people and middle-aged people, called: "Young people do not know the taste of sorrow, love to go upstairs, love to go upstairs; to write new words and force sorrow. Now I know the taste of sorrow, wanting to speak but stopping, wanting to speak but stopping; but I say it's a good autumn because it's cool," generally autumn gives people more fantasy and less warmth: the red leaves are dotted, like the tears of those who leave, so the toiling people and thinking wives hum the lines "Today I have become a friend of phoenixes, only then do I know that red leaves are good matchmakers," and cannot help but feel heartbroken. In fact, autumn comes and autumn goes, and it doesn't care about people's idle affairs, but people stubbornly ask the flowers about their tears and sow their emotions with sorrow; "if heaven has feelings, heaven should grow old" God is heartless, but people's faces in the mirror have changed to full temples of frost.</p>
<p>Seeing the autumn clouds like gauze, changing unpredictably, a white sail hanging on the tree tops at the edge of the sky, sailing into the yellow leaves, there is a lonely old man, leaning on a cane on the plank bridge; the water flows eastward, and people will pass away to the west. In the distance, there is a middle-aged woman, drying clothes in the west building, watching a pair of water gulls up and down, leaning on the railing and thinking, I don't know what she is thinking. Farther away: a desolate scene, the wind blowing the grass low, cattle and sheep dotted, jumping and chasing in the slanting sunset. Everyone has experienced this scene more or less. Looking back like a dream, occasionally thinking about it, it really makes people want it so much, love it so much, hate it so much, feel sorrow so much.</p>
<p>"Who planted banana trees outside the window, rustling in the morning, rustling in the evening" When a person's emotions are so overwhelmed that they cannot be vented, they often cannot help but complain about various things; but in reality, it is often: "It is your heart that is too bored, planting banana trees and complaining about banana trees."</p>
<p>Holding the pen in confusion, thinking about the years of drifting about, I always feel disappointed like looking for red flowers in autumn. "Autumn wind is rogue, the traveler has no clothes" Autumn after all gives people desolate memories.</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng 36</p>
<p>You might retort to the writer: "Of this long legend you are writing now, at least five or six tenths are about reports of our counter-espionage work, is there not even one character in there who is 'still working'? Even if some have already changed positions, with the other side being so petty, contemptible, and treacherous, and actively operating, organizing, and preparing under various disguises; when the time comes, they will surely 'do it again,' 'punish,' 'annihilate,' aren't they paying attention to these people?"</p>
<p>Regarding this, I can clearly report to you; some of the characters I have written about have made regrettable and honorable sacrifices; some, to put it more mysteriously, are impossible for the Japanese devils to discover; and for some, there are detailed records of each of them in the important secret books of the Japanese devils, and the important demonic stars of those international "war criminals" also know them, and some have even had more than a cup of wine with them, but these characters, perhaps to put it a bit exaggeratedly, they truly have the subtlety of divine dragons and the unpredictability of ghosts and gods. If the Japanese devils want to do anything to them, I'm afraid they can't do it.</p>
<p>However, there are many "continued" related actions, not to mention me, I'm afraid anyone would find it inconvenient to write about, and there is no need to write about them. For example, part of what Mr. W is talking about here in Yaoqun is indeed unnecessary to write about. Only a few principles on the oath might as well be published; after Mr. W explained the nature of the oath and the personnel organization, he continued:</p>
<p>"...In addition to these outlines, we also have a "three haves" doctrine: first, do not be greedy for credit; second, do not be afraid of sacrifice, but do not make unnecessary sacrifices; third, do not waver. The so-called unwavering has a broader meaning; in short, it is to always uphold justice, and under any harsh circumstances, "wealth and honor cannot corrupt... power and force cannot subdue." Incidentally, there is also an important condition; that is "integrity"..."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Mr. W couldn't help but sigh, turned around, and told me a story about "integrity":</p>
<p>It was before the July 7th Incident, when the Japanese devils formally provoked the war, they wanted to occupy North China without bloodshed, so they implemented Matsuoka's bankrupt household doctrine of "armed smuggling." Our counter-espionage organization quickly sent a group of comrades to confront those ruffian merchants. Among them, there was a young comrade who had always worked diligently and had very high aspirations.</p>
<p>For a long period of time, this young man was able to stick to his post. Later, he received a letter from home saying that his mother was seriously ill, and medicine and nutrition all required money. You know, our secret service comrades, although they were doing the work of beheading and shedding blood, were just like soldiers, with graded salaries, and very meager.</p>
<p>This comrade, just when he was at a loss, happened to catch a batch of smuggled goods. According to his usual behavior, he could resist everything and implement "handling official business officially." But when he was in this urgent need of money and short of money, he actually succumbed, accepted several hundred yuan in activity fees, and let the smuggled goods go. This matter can be said to be absolutely "unknown to gods and ghosts"; because the secret service organization completely took the principle of trust for each comrade.</p>
<p>This young comrade, in terms of self-confidence; he believed that it was absolutely "only this once, no exceptions." Who knew that this kind of thing, once an exception was made, no matter how big or small the exception was, it was like digging a gap in a dam, and it was impossible to avoid a flood, as the saying goes "do it long enough and you will make a mistake"; so this comrade was caught and shot.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Municipal Council <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Today is the fourth day of the council meeting. As a citizen, I can say that I am very satisfied with our representatives for the past three days, because our representatives have truly done their best to speak without reservation. It is especially worth mentioning that two councilors were originally members of the Political Council, but they were willing to resign from the Political Council and serve as councilors for the local area. This spirit of starting from basic work is enough to set an example for future local autonomy, and it is something that should be praised.</p>
<p>The Greater Shanghai area is vast, with a large population and a complex environment. There are many works to be done and reforms to be made. Especially after eight years of enemy and puppet occupation, it is truly a complex and chaotic situation. Although the municipal authorities are determined to move forward, their eyes and ears may not be able to see everything, and their methods may be lacking. Having a municipal council is like having two ears on a car, either making proposals or asking questions, even if they are passionate and angry, with stern faces and sharp words, even if they are tit-for-tat and aggressive: but they are definitely not enemies or rivals deliberately making trouble. If they are oversensitive and think that so-and-so has a personal grudge against me, or so-and-so is unhappy because of something... then they are鑽入牛角尖 (lit. drilling into a bull's horn, meaning getting into a dead end), only bureaucrats would think that way.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a big city, and the cooperation between the municipal council and the municipal government should have a demonstrative effect for the whole country. We certainly trust our representatives to express our opinions completely and without reservation, but we also hope that what we propose will not be perfunctory by the municipal government, but will be sincerely considered and implemented.</p>
<p>There are still nine days left in the session of the municipal council, and fruitful results can be expected. I would like to offer my advance congratulations.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Lay Down the Cleaver and Become a Buddha on the Spot: A Bandit Achieves Enlightenment <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Chong Zhen</p>
<p>The major bandit Yang ×× has revolted, and we have some feelings about it. Recalling the name of Yang ××, it was not well known in the past. Because he was a traitor and a bandit, and now he has revolted; therefore, we have gradually come to know him again, and it turns out that he is a role who is accustomed to doing tricks.</p>
<p>His trilogy is: traitor, bandit, revolt. During the enemy puppet era, the name of Yang Si Taiye was almost known to everyone in the corners of Jiangnan, and he was extremely popular for a time. He successively served as the chief of staff of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Security Headquarters, and the puppet county magistrate of Wujiang and Wuxi, etc. At that time, he was powerful and did whatever he wanted. The people in his jurisdiction all hated him to the bone.</p>
<p>The arrival of victory was also his doomsday. Yang ×× knew that things were not good, and it was difficult to escape the law. Therefore, he changed his body and continued to do the things of a gangster, scurrying into Taihu Lake and becoming a bandit leader. After Yang entered Taihu Lake, he recruited soldiers and horses, and gathered bandits, about five hundred people and fourteen ships, entrenched near Pingtai Mountain, set up the "Jiangnan Democratic Allied Army Headquarters" flag, and appointed himself commander-in-chief, still acting as the local emperor. He looted the surrounding villages, so that the order in several counties near Taihu Lake, such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Wujiang, and Yixing, was unstable and the security was difficult.</p>
<p>The authorities were extremely concerned about this matter. Army Deputy Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo General has ordered Commander Li Mo'an of the First Pacification District to suppress the bandits within a time limit in order to prevent the bandit scourge. After Yang the bandit heard about it, he knew that there was no room for him to stand, so he actually revolted in a proper manner.</p>
<p>In fact, his set of tricks is known to everyone. Being a traitor is to willingly sell out the country. If caught, he would be shot. He had no choice but to "enter" Taihu Lake and temporarily avoid it. When everyone's eyes were turned away, and they thought he was a bandit, he was very happy, and of course he took this opportunity to revolt. Not only was the crime of banditry cancelled, but even the old debt of being a traitor was written off.</p>
<p>Today, although he is confessing that he has always kept himself behind closed doors and has never entered the lake as a bandit, and is willing to engage in pacification work under the leadership of the government, how beautiful he speaks, better than listening to a clear song.</p>
<p>His three sets of tricks are: being a traitor is willingly selling out the country, being a bandit is a bridge to escape the crime of being a traitor, and revolting is achieving enlightenment.</p>
<p>We dare not say that even the opportunity to reform is denied, but to lay down the cleaver and achieve enlightenment all at once is a bit "that"!</p>
<h3 id="e148">Stock Exchange <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Xin</p>
<p>The name of the exchange varies from country to country. In the old days, our country called it "Maoqian Company." In the laws of the Republic of China, it was officially named "Exchange."</p>
<p>The first exchange established in China was the Beijing Stock Exchange, which opened on August 1, 1918. This was the first exchange in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Shanghai exchange business was most developed in the summer and autumn of 1921, with more than 140 companies, but they all perished within a few months, which is known as the "Tenth Year Turmoil."</p>
<p>Before the war, Shanghai's five major exchanges were securities, gold, yarn, flour, and miscellaneous grains, with securities and yarn trading being the most prosperous.</p>
<p>In my old and stubborn brain, the stock exchange is deeply engraved as a speculative place, and the employees are speculative friends.</p>
<p>It is said that speculation is absolutely different from gambling. Speculators use experience, knowledge, and judgment to determine gains and losses; while gambling aims to take advantage of luck.</p>
<p>The prosperity of Shanghai's consumer market largely depends on the support of speculators.</p>
<p>Some people estimate that the ratio of speculators who fail in the stock exchange to those who start from the stock exchange is exactly the same as the ratio of legal tender to counterfeit money, two hundred to one.</p>
<p>The Shaohai Securities Exchange opened recently. Some people say that the establishment of a capital market is worth celebrating; others say, be careful of fire!</p>
<h3 id="e149">Hong Kong Tram <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Housheng</p>
<p>——He Youzhi Shi</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Hong Kong will feel the convenience and comfort of the Hong Kong tram, and it also has a sense of beauty. It is perpetually clad in a green, brand-new coat, with two floors, tall, like a box, gliding lightly beneath the mountains and along the coast.</p>
<p>The number of trams in Hong Kong can truly be described as closely packed. Morning, day, evening, no matter what time it is, when you leave home and walk to the station, there is always a tram parked there, waiting for you to ride. Passengers will not have the phenomenon of rushing to be first. For a past tram, there will never be any lingering or regretful feelings, because when the first one leaves, in less than a minute, the second one will follow, and there will never be a long wait or inability to get on.</p>
<p>On the tram, although there are doors, they are not closed, and no passenger will stand on the platform or lose their footing while driving. Therefore, passengers can enter and exit freely, and do not have to wait for the ticket seller to open the door when they arrive at the station. In the morning, you can see wealthy mistresses dressed neatly, carrying baskets full of fish, meat, vegetables, standing leisurely holding the pillars inside the tram. Although the small vegetable market is only as far from home as Sincere Company is from Dah Sun Company, the mistresses will never give up this convenient means of transportation.</p>
<p>Every tram is not overcrowded. The first-class upper level is often sparsely populated with one person, mostly foreigners and upper-class Chinese. Ordinary people do not sit in first class, it is better to say that it is to save a little money than to say that it is inconvenient to go up and down the stairs. However, in the evening, there are still many leisurely people sitting in the front row of first class, taking a ride, enjoying the cool breeze, and looking at the city scenery. This can be said to be a cheap, good, and unsurpassed entertainment.</p>
<p>The population density of Hong Kong is much greater than that of Shanghai. However, taking the tram in Hong Kong is such a convenient and enjoyable thing, while in Shanghai it is such a troublesome and painful thing. In a word, it is only a matter of more or fewer vehicles.</p>

<p>A Record of Commander Ji's Conversation</p>
<p>For half a year, Shanghai's transportation has been in chaos.</p>
<p>To say something to excuse the authorities, in fact, the authorities are not ignoring this issue, but in this extremely complex Shanghai, the number of vehicles of all kinds is increasing day by day, and it is not easy to seek a sweeping solution in a short period of time! Moreover, the generation of a method is always difficult to reach a special class.</p>
<p>On the 22nd of last month, Commander Ji, when attending the Shanghai Alumni Association's dinner, mentioned the Shanghai transportation problem.</p>
<p>Commander Ji said: "Today, I advise all of you as a classmate. For the vehicles in Shanghai (including cars, trucks, jeeps, etc.), I have issued an order to all subordinate agencies that all vehicles must have a permit. After this order was issued, the first to comply were the vehicles of the US military throughout the city. Not one of them is without a permit. However, on the contrary, it is our own military vehicles, jeeps, etc. that cannot be fully complied with. I only hope that those of you who are present, if you have a vehicle and do not have a permit, should apply for the permit as soon as possible, otherwise, you cannot blame me when you are caught in the future!"</p>
<p>Recently, the measures decided by Mayor Wu's meeting to improve traffic have been strictly implemented since September 9th. Vehicles that violate the rules three times will have their licenses revoked. These days, the traffic on the roads seems to be a little better. At any time, if you want to cross the road, you will feel in your mind that the traffic order has changed.</p>
<p>But here, what we urgently hope for is: everyone abides by the traffic regulations, and does not take pride in acting outside the rules! Otherwise, under any circumstances, there is no hope for Shanghai's transportation!</p>

<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 9th. At 8:00 AM on the morning of the 10th, he hastily departed from Shanghai Jiangwan Airport on a special plane to the United States. It is said that Mr. Zhang's trip abroad is to treat toxic cancer under his left jaw. This cancer developed a year ago, initially causing no pain or discomfort, but recently it has become slightly bothersome. After diagnosis by a Western doctor, it was identified as toxic cancer. Mr. Zhang followed the advice and went to the United States for medical treatment. Taking this opportunity, the author will discuss the life stories of this "military man turned politician."</p>
<p>Studying in Japan</p>
<p>Zhang, whose courtesy name is Yuejun, is from Huayang, Sichuan, and was born in the 13th year of the Guangxu Emperor. After graduating from the Baoding Military Rapid Training School, he enrolled in the Tokyo Japanese Army Officer School. It was during this time that he participated in the Tongmenghui, an organization of students studying in Japan. During the Xinhai Revolution, he returned to Shanghai from Japan with Chairman Chiang, serving as a section chief in the Shanghai Military Governor's Office and as the commander of the 23rd Division. In the 6th year of the Republic (1917), he served as a military advisor in the Grand Marshal's Office and in the military government. From the 8th to the 9th year of the Republic (1919-1920), he managed police affairs in Sichuan Province. From the 13th to the 14th year of the Republic (1924-1925), he was responsible for reorganizing police affairs in Henan Province. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the chief advisor to the Commander-in-Chief and presided over the affairs of the Nanchang Headquarters. Subsequently, he served as a member of the Military Affairs Commission. In March of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), he was appointed as the director of the Shanghai Arsenal. In October, he was reassigned as the Deputy Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Military Administration and concurrently as the Director of the Arsenal Administration and the President of Tongji University. In the 18th year of the Republic (1929), he was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee. On April 1st of the same year, he became the Mayor of Shanghai, resigning in January of the 21st year of the Republic (1932). Subsequently, he served as the Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and the Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government until today.</p>
<p>During His Tenure as Mayor of Shanghai</p>
<p>During Mr. Zhang's tenure as Mayor of Shanghai, local tabloids published news that Mr. Zhang had been shot at, resulting in the injury of his bodyguard. Mr. Zhang dismissed it with a smile. In fact, Mr. Zhang has always acted impartially throughout his life, believing that he had not offended anyone, so he never hired a bodyguard. When Mr. Zhang first arrived in Shanghai, he rented a small house on Rue Lupan. A friend, Mr. Zheng, advised him to move to a better residence. Mr. Zhang replied that his health was not good and he could not afford to buy a house. Mr. Zheng offered to sell his own house on Avenue Albert, agreeing on a price of 20,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, three months passed, and Mr. Zhang was still penniless and unable to pay. Later, it was changed to installment payments, and the purchase of the house was finally settled.</p>
<p>There is also a well-known anecdote about Mr. Zhang and Chairman Chiang: When Martyr Chen Ying Shi served as the Military Governor of Shanghai, Chairman Chiang and Mr. Zhang were both subordinates. One winter night, Mr. Zhang entered Chairman Chiang's office to discuss an important military secret. The matter was complex and mysterious, and neither could immediately decide. They lowered their heads and pondered, remaining silent for a long time. The biting north wind was piercingly cold, and the two sat facing each other, stiff as wooden chickens. As Chiang Kai-shek had not replied, Zhang Qun also did not speak further and waited until the break of dawn.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Zhang's trip to the United States for medical treatment, some speculate that he is carrying a major mission, but relevant parties have indicated that this is not true.</p>
