<h3>主席團第廿次會決議國大會期延長兩天昨大會中聽取審查報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕國民大會第十次大會，十八日晨九時三刻舉行，出席代表一三二七人，主席團由第一組輪值，蔣主席亦坐在台上後排主席位上，何成濬担任大會主席，宣布開會後，甲·報吿事項：（一）宜讀第九次會議紀錄，（二）秘書處報吿文件，賀電及請假函件，（三）主席團報吿，（四）代表資格審查委員會報吿。乙·討論事項：主席宣布由各審查會報吿審查結果及綜合審查會審查完畢後始能開始討論，今日開始各組報吿，計第一審查會張知本報吿，第二審查會林彬報吿，第三審查會王世杰報吿，第四審查會江一平，水梓，李巾襄三人報吿，至十二時一刻散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕國大主席團第廿次會議，十八日下午四時舉行，由田烱錦主席，決議如下：（一）會期延長兩天，（二）十九日上午十時舉行十一次大會，並推定田烱錦担任主席，（三）十九日上午十時舉行綜合審委會整理小組會議，（四）十九日下午三時舉行第六次綜合審委會，（五）十九日下午四時舉行主席團第廿一次會議。</p>

<h3>憲草總綱第一條　綜合會覆議維持原草案　監委名額問題爭論激烈</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕憲草綜合審委會第五次會，十八日下午五時半假大會會塲舉行，開會時出席代表一一三人，旋續增爲一二七人，陳誠主席。首由雷副秘書長宣讀陳誠等三十七人所提請保留憲草第一條原條文，對綜合審委會之決定加以覆議之動議。繼由陳誠應鄂區代表黃紹美等之要求，坦白說明提出覆議之理由，略謂，晨間大會之所以僅報吿審查結果，未及討論者，全因此項條文爭執不決，使各黨派對此各有意見，聞靑年黨陳啓天先生，曾因焦慮而吐血，國民黨同志亦爲此連日爭辯，但終推誠協和，故請予以覆議，維持憲草原文，俾會議工作得順利進行，以底於成。陳辭畢，傅斯年首表反對，認爲綜合審委會對此點已有決議，如有變更，應於大會中提出。另一部分代表則贊同覆議，陳主席即將原案文提出表決，當有若干代表起而抗議，江一平調：「無論如何委曲求全，議事規程應予尊重」。潘公展稱：「余以爲，按法定程序，不能即逕以原草案條文付表決，應先經過覆議程序，即使決定可予覆議，無論如何，顧大體求妥協，少數人之意見，亦在討論時發表，記入紀錄，業經通過之傅代表所主張删去原草案第一條中「民有·民治·民享之」七字之修改，其理由吾人均尙能記憶，（不能同意此意義不明，文法不通之文詞。）本人已贊同傅代表之意見，請在大會提出變更之覆議，即或本會接受覆議，大會及審查會仍須將此意見鄭重紀錄」。（鼓掌）陳主席乃立即停止表決，對其處理此案因求效率，而有疏忽一點表示歉意，並宣吿開始發言。</p>
<p>傅斯年首謂：「今日再提此一問題，並非堅欲維持前次之決議，以達遂余個人之主張目的，乃係由於精神之感觸，自認余之靈魂未予別人任何保證，應有發言之自由。余以爲有理均應闡明，決非自滬來一電話，即可率然決定，此絕非民主政治同，而係道地之君主政治。適間某代表云：「法國憲法中，亦有「民有，民治，民享」一語，唯法憲巾此語並未涉及國體，乃僅列爲其政府之原則。法憲第一條原文爲：「法蘭西爲一不可分的，超宗敎的，民主的，社會的共和國」。國體明確一查便知。（鼓掌）故吾人目前所爭執者，似乎並非在於道理，不爭追理猶謂民主政治，余未之聞。余決不奢望以此理由推翻此覆議案，僅希望將之附入紀錄。余曾極力反對某一部分人，將憲法拉回五五憲草，今日余亦反對此種號稱民主之集會中，不民主之會議方式，故希望予以記載，天下後世自有其正確之判斷，而論定此是否民主自由之作風也。」（鼓掌）</p>
<p>傅詞畢，蔣勻田起稱：「余主張對此一問題暫緩決定，待各方再推誠協議。蓋第一，吾等少數黨在會議中之作用，僅可以情理實現其主張，如恃表決權，實難達任何目的，此爲吾人所不取，第二，對此一點尖銳之爭執，縱國民黨方面遝用其嚴明之紀律，使各黨員放棄主張，情感上難免有不愉快之處，此亦吾人所不願。（鼓掌）第三，此艱巨之制憲工作，黨派方面僅國民，靑年及民社三黨參加，吾人必須注意彼等未參加此項工作之黨派及全國　人士之意向，俾對吾人之決議可邀得同意與接受，此民社黨同人所切望。由此三者，余主張此一問題暫緩付諸表決，另行協議」。（鼓掌〕</p>
<p>繼由陳啓天發言謂，憲草審議工作，進行盈年，其中不少波折，數方面對一件事之決定，實不可能完全贊同，能求其决而求得大體滿意，已屬佳事。吾人參加制憲之用意，即在制定一全國可勉强同意之憲法，近數日來爲此事焦慮責甚，確曾吐血。余至盼此蔣主席提出之條文，得以順利獲得各位之支持，而能成立」。</p>
<p>至此，要求發言者，此起彼落，冷欣起謂：「余以爲各方理由均已說明，不必再以刺戟之語調，徒事理論之辯證，請主席付表決」。當爲陳主席接受，以一一八票之絕對多數，通過覆議意見。綜合審委會對第一條之決議仍維持草案原文：「中華民國基於三民主義爲民有，民治，民享之民主共和國」。</p>
<p>此一論題過後，即開始依照議事日程，進行十七日宋完之討論。（八）司法院院長，大法官，監察院同意權問題，第「八三」條整理意見，維持第四審委會之審查，結果通過。（九）考試院組織及監察院同意權問題，第「八九」條整理意見，採用第四審委會之第二項審查結果，修改爲：「考試院設院長副院長各一人，考試委員若干人，由總統（下删「依法　一兩字）提名，經監察院同意任命之」通過。（十）公職人員考銓問題，第九十一條整理意見，維持原草案：「公職候選人資格」不在考銓之列，通過。（十一）監察院同意權及懲戒權問題，第九十五條整理意見，照第四審委會審查結果修改爲：「監察院爲國家最高監察機關，行使同意彈劾糾舉（下删「懲戒」兩字）及審計權」·第九十九條整理意見，修改爲：「監察院依本憲法行使同意權時，由出席委員過半數之決議行之」，均獲通過。至此，（十二）監察委員名額問題，又復引起激烈舌戰。甘區代表張維高發言，要求維持憲草第九十六條原條文，每省五人，每市二人之規定。任卓宣起而反對謂，我國爲單一國，各省人口不等，不能爲一律之硬性規定，主張採取第四審委會各省一人至五人，每直轄市一人至二人之彈性規定。</p>
<p>阮毅成贊助張維高之意見，並詳說理由稱：「第一，大會對少數民族問題已生爭執，不可再發生少數人口問題。第二，國大及立法院均照人口比例，監委應照地域平等原則，使各省市在監察院中，有平等行使同意彈劾之　·第三，監委非監察人民，乃監督官吏，各省市人口，雖有多少而各級政府編制，大致相仿，官員數目無何差異，故不應以人口爲準。本席爲浙江代表，浙省人口衆多，但亦願各人口較少之省份得平等參加監院」。</p>
<p>李中襄以第四審委會召集人之資格，說明該會審查此條時，並未完全依據人口標準之原則，而爲各省幅負之不同，（如與安省僅七縣）而議決此彈性之規定。</p>
<p>江一平則謂，第「一一一」條中已增「行政區劃」一類，省區重劃，早晚必行，渠亦主張維持草案原文，反對以人口決定監委人數。</p>
<p>至此，陳逸雲，王孝英，復爲婦女爭取監委名額發言。陳謂；「婦女作監察工作，一定很好。（衆大笑，鼓掌。）假如選舉比例一項可通過，則無關係，否則監察方面應單獨規定」。王主監委之名額分配，應與立委相同，王曉籟爲直轄市及職業圑體呼籲，主張直轄市之監委名額，應增爲四人，至少亦須三人，職業選舉亦應兼採。一時發言者紛紛紜　。王含章力闢衆議，大聲疾呼，請注意邊彊問題，予邊遠省份以平等地位，主張維持憲草原文，會衆反應不一，浪潮繼續增高，不可抑制，至五時十五分秩序大亂，陳主席乃宜吿休息，由召集人集會，整理各種意見。</p>
<p>五時四十分續會，陳報吿整理結果，並說明召集人意見數點：（一）大小省之問題，於省區重劃後，可自然解決。（二）監委任務，乃監察官吏，政治如能清明，不需此制更佳，不必因名額問題，影響和諧之會議情緒。（三）職業人人有之，選舉決不能及於無業游民，無須另列。（四）婦女之地位，當然應予提高，可以君子協定保證，而不便訂諸憲法，於選舉法中或能設法。旋付表決，結果以一〇一　之絕對多數通過，維持第「九六」條原文，並加列一款：「僑居國外之國民八人」等十字。陳逸雲當要求將陳主席之報吿附入紀錄·王孝英，王曉籟，聲明保留於大會中之發言權，一塲風彼，乃吿平息。（十三）監察院對院長副院長究彈劾問題，第「一〇五」條整理意見維持草案原文，不必有特殊規定通過。（十四）第十一章省縣制度，改爲地方制度問題，整理意見依照第六，第八審委會審查結果，經爭辯後一七六票通過。至此，已六時零五分，全體會衆拒絕延長時間，宣吿散會。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽十八日電〕十六日平滯班機常日飛向瀋陽時，因霧迷失方向，竟飛朝鮮上空，於只餘一百加崙汽油時，降落平壤機塲。降落後，機中三十旅客於驚恐之餘，發現塲內停有多數蘇軍用飛機，同時幷有蘇軍前來盤查，所有旅客初以爲誤降旅大機塲，後始知爲平壤，蘇方負責人見機中多婦孺，知係旅客機，雖言語不通，但表示甚客氣，終因時近黃昏，乃停機過夜，蘇方人員殷勤招待，幷供給飲食，盛意可感。十七日下午放行，蘇方代爲加油，於下午四時半返抵瀋陽，乘客有熊主任夫人及行轅某參課長，據駕到員談，當時在大霧中，雖已知危急，但仍極力鎭靜，因所載係旅客，以全體旅客生命爲重，故未準備跳傘，是後接得地面電訊下降，結果竟爲平壤，惟蘇方友情可感。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕民盟主席張瀾，十八日淸晨乘三北公司龍安輪到滬，往迎者有沈鈞儒·李濟琛。黃炎培·章伯鈞·陳家康·潘梓年等。張氏當即發表書面談話稱：「在民盟總部遷京之後，早擬東下。兩個月前即由蓉到渝，當時本欲一直東來，乃到渝即知國大召集令已下，且適患病，遂暫滯留渝中·此次來滬，係照原定計劃，並非臨時決定。民盟不應參加分裂的國大，余在渝時，曾同南京總部通過電話，得知中央及各地同志。均一致如此主張，聞之甚慰。民盟何以不參加國大，及對時局意見，在上月廿四日民盟在京招待記者時已有書面談話，余自極端同意。今後民盟當一本初衷，擁護政協，反對內戰，力求和平·民主·統一之實現。對調解武力黨爭，允當保持超然獨立之第三者立塲，繼續盡其最大之努力。更願聯絡眞正第三方面之士及一切愛好和平之人羣，相與努力。</p>
<p>至於參加政府與吾，在內戰未停止，政協決議未實現之前，民盟根木不考慮此事。旣在召開之國大，一切情形，亦根本不欲加以批評。目前全中國老百姓所迫切需要的是不打仗，要不打仗才能生活得下去。否則全中國人民無論農工商學，眼看就只有同歸於盡之途。抗戰結束，已逾一年，還要呌老百姓負擔戰爭痛苦，眞是太不成話了。　關於民社黨與民盟今後之關係，應俟民盟二中全會之決定。惟無論如何，對於爭取民主，彼此意見，當無異致。今後不論盟內盟外，自須通力合作。民盟二中全會日期及地點，須俟巾常會開後，始能決定。張東蓀先生可能到滬出席。梁漱溟先生暫不東下，但他並不消極，對國事及盟務，曾屢次與余研討，意見都甚相同」。</p>

<h3>雨花台畔巨奸伏法　齊逆燮元昨槍決　老賊怕死刑前慌亂無惜</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕華北巨奸齊燮元，於本年五月由平解京，迭經審訊，月前判處死刑，十七日下午奉陳總長　奉主席准許執行。十八日晨記者前往監獄探視，見齊逆於仁字一號監席地用早餐，係以豆芽豆腐佐糙米乾飯，此時齊逆尚不知執行在即。旋大批記者參觀時，空氣頓形緊張，葉蓬等巨奸沉默不語，齊逆尤爲不安，似已知死神將臨。十時正士兵到監點名，將齊逆提出監獄。時齊逆身着藍綢新皮袍，頭戴瓜皮帽，藍綢棉褲，黑毡鞋，灰黃色毛襪，老態臃腫，步伐零亂，齊即詢衛兵「是否今天執行」？衛兵答曰：「不是，不是」！齊逆乃鎮靜如初，出第三道門時，齊逆自言自語說「今天星期三，是接見家裏人的」？正擬轉向家屬接見室，衛兵向出大門方向一拉，老賊頓知情況不妙，當時面色大變顫抖不止，雙手籠於袖管內，任人拖拉前進時審判長孟傅大，審判官徐鎮南，張　生，何國魂，書記官馬政強已升庭，齊逆到庭後，神智大亂，不知所　。據供：六十二歲，河北寗河縣人，前軍委會北平分會軍事顧問，審判長旋宣讀判決主文：「齊逆燮元，通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處死刑，褫奪公權終身，全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒收。」審判長旋又宣佈：「本案業奉最高當局批准，今晨執行。齊燮元有何話說」。此時齊逆已入昏沉狀態，不知所答，約二分鐘高呼「齊—燮—元—忠—愛—國—家—」。聲猶未畢，法官即白，「你對家屬有何話說」？齊逆又大聲答：「沒有話說」！</p>
<p>寫「遺囑」週身發抖</p>
<p>法官問他還有何話可說？要不要寫一封信給家屬？他說：「怎麼寫啊？」法官說，你要寫，有地方給你寫，他答要寫，遂在軍士警戒下，在法庭門口一小桌上，齊逆以墨筆書「遺囑」兩則，（見另條）當時提筆時已週身發抖。</p>
<p>約歷二十分之久，書寫完畢，以墨筆向桌上重重一丟，當由軍士加以就綁，此時齊逆神經緊張至於極點，亦不要求鬆綁，四顧觀眾稱，「請大家年，這是忠愛國家的結果！」言語間已無倫次經過綑綁後，即推上預停門口之大卡車，以最快速率直駛雨花台刑場。</p>
<p>面北而跪　一槍斃命</p>
<p>刑場之上，早有約二千餘觀眾　集山頭等候看斬，刑車到達後，執行軍士立刻即會同南郊警局佈置警戒，在迅速之時間下，將齊運携至山下草坪上，面北而跪，監刑官顔厚德，王靜武一聲令，執行兵楊廣照，以步槍立發一槍，由後背正中打入，齊逆即應聲倒地，軍士即去其綁，將身子翻正。此時距開槍僅兩分鍾，齊逆尚未氣絕，眼睛逐漸由大而閉小，面色泛起死象，皮袍正胸裂開一洞，創口中鮮血汩汩湧出，毫不掙扎，又歷二分鐘死去，時正十時三十分。</p>
<h3>齊逆兩「遺囑」</h3>
<p>其一</p>
<p>「齊燮元爲忠愛國家之人，不期爲忌者所害，望我同胞及家屬共鍳之。」</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>「國事變幻非常，同胞總以忠愛國家爲本，不可因我忠愛國家，所得之結果，致不可爲也，其以國家權利之爭也，其以國家權利之爭者，國家可亡，民族可滅，而政權不可捨者，燮元死爲厲鬼，亦必以此物爲敵也，言不及私，如是而已。」</p>
<p>四闆木棺　巨奸已矣</p>

<h3>殺蟲新劑「滴丁死」</h3>
<p>台中糖廠製成　可除植物害蟲</p>
<p>〔中央社台北十八日電〕資源委員會台中糖厰，近製造「蒂利斯」粉，係一種強力有效之植物殺蟲劑，目前知者尚少。此種藥劑，係利用豆料植物中之蒂利斯（DERTS）根製成。台北市民馬場弦，於一九二七年自新嘉坡移人苗種，逐年推廣種植，一九四三年該厰設立蒂利斯工厰，從事製造成品，目前產量每月已達一萬五千斤，蒂利斯根中含有毒素，名羅堤家（ROTENON），藥力較　鉛尚大三十倍，不論任何濃度，均可殺死植物害蟲，并有促進植物生育改良品種及增加收穫量之功效。該厰於一九三〇年因甘蔗遭受兩種害蟲即鐵絲蟲及白蟻之害經試用蒂利斯粉後，極見功效，迄今仍在普遍應用中。此種藥劑，對於動物，亦有強烈之毒力，如吞入腹中，十分鍾至三小時內即可喪命，接觸者亦將於三十分鍾內至六小時內喪命，身長三尺之大魚，亦可於其百萬倍之溶液中畢命，故亦爲減除臭蟲之有效藥劑，惟是否超過「DDT」之效力，目前因尚未從事比較研究，無法斷定。聞昔時馬來亞土人均以此種植物做成毒矢，作爲捕魚或打獵之用，目前台灣及南洋各地，出產均多，該厰現將此粉成品改稱爲「滴丁死」殺蟲劑，每磅售價台幣十二元。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>治標莫忘治本</h3>
<p>懋遷有無，本是雙方互利的行爲。現在國際關係，日益密切，鎖國時代，早成陳跡。不但以已所有，易彼所無，是國際貿易的常軌，便是各儘所長，捨其所短，也未嘗不適合經濟的原理。</p>
<p>所成爲問題的，是國際關係有順有逆，關稅壁壘，未盡廢除，出入口貨的限制，與國內管制的殘跡，即在經濟狀況較爲優越如英美等國，迄今也沒有完全掃除。所以本國剩餘品能否自由運銷，本國必需品能否自由採辦，在今日還是理想。至於軍興時期，互施封鎖，交通斷絕，至到國內產業界陷入了極度的擾亂和困難的境地，在抗戰八年後的我國，撫今思昔，大家都還有深刻的體認吧！</p>
<p>所以自給自足這理想，在事實上雖不容易做到，在理論上也未必完全可通，而一國經濟的命脈，尤其民生日用的必需品，時時抑人乳哺，無力自給，到底是極危險的事。第一次歐戰結果，人人知道，同盟國是失敗於麵包，第二次大戰結果，也人人知道，協約國是得力在生產。從這些歷史的教訓看來，可知一國的經濟基礎，如果過於脆弱，沒有獨立自存的能力，那是狠可寒心的。</p>
<p>我國因爲不平等條約的結果，經濟上早已淪於次殖民地地位。勝利以後，不平等條約雖已先後取消，但經濟基礎，斵喪過甚，到如今還沒有恢復得起來。又值幣制，匯率，物價，交通，勞工等等問題，紛紛擾擾，得不到合理的解決，眼前這個狠脆弱的基礎，竟有整個地動搖之象。這裏且舉幾個實例來檢討一下。</p>
<p>經濟上的需要，最主要的無過於衣食綢緞與呢絨次之。現在紡紗一來，號爲比較有利。但生產量還根本不夠，大部份的棉花又須仰給於海外，外棉不濟，這項比較有利的工業勢將根本動搖。這幾日來，爲外棉結匯問題，當局和當業連日商討，煞費苦心，可知原料問題十分嚴重，也就是說：紡織工業和民衣問題十分嚴重。又傳日印布疋到港，消息到滬，本市布市，便立時起了波動。在這內外夾攻的紡織工業，前途何等可慮！</p>
<p>絲織業的危機，只消看他申請貸款的急迫，和放寬條件的呼籲，便可知其大概。這點，還可說是現在各業的通病。最可慮的是：（一）日本的人造絲不到，該業便有閉厰的危險。（二）日本的蠶繭不到，又傳繅絲厰將於年底全部停工，照此看來，無論綢織業，繅絲業，其生命綫竟完全寄托在洋貨上。而外銷不動，絲業又無動彈，迫得由中信局出而價購，綢緞業積貨過多，又不得不賴舉債爲活，這又是何等悽慘之事！</p>
<p>毛織業是新興的企業。據該業報告：如果全部開工，狠可以供給國內的需要。其困難在（一）外貨廉價傾銷，無法與之競爭，（二）所用原料，大部份須仰給海外。今拋開第一點不談，我國本是產毛之國，數量亦不算多，其所以購用洋貨，據說是由於纖維的長度，比較合用，并由於攙雜較少，易於整理之故。那麼，在此等缺陷還未能補救以前，該業的原料，也須仰給國外。</p>
<p>我國本是農業國，介在戰前，每年已須鉅額洋米來接濟，今年五六月間，米價飛漲，政府除運川贛米到滬供銷外，也曾購買巴西等洋米來補充，好像和英國日本等國一般，大有一日不可無此君之概，這已覺雜於索解。除米而外，麵粉也是主要食品，製粉事業，在我國新式工業中，且佔有相當地位。無奈國產小麥，不夠需要，不久以前，曾以原料不繼，一度停工。政府爲維持民食。維持是項工業起見，迫得採購洋米以資接濟。照此說來，米糧與麵粉這兩個主要民食，俱非仰給外國來補充不可。至於魚翅，海參，蝦米，罐頭食物，洋酒，水菓等等，洋貨充斥，尤其餘事。</p>
<p>建築材料，以五金，水泥，木材等爲最主要。五金大都屬舶來品，現在尚無國產品可以替代。可能替代的爲水泥，又爲廉價的洋貨所壓倒了。新式建築，卻非購用洋松，企口板等不可。皖閩等處國產木材，非但不夠替代，而且水腳奇昂，成本太貴，依舊無法競爭。現在房荒嚴重，各地皆然，而建築業仍呆滯如故。其中原因自然很多。但是國內原料根本不夠，當然也是其中之一。</p>
<p>談到民行，情形尤爲嚴重。試看火車，機車，汽車，電車，輪船，那一种不是舶來品？至少是機械部分，車胎部份，不能不靠進口貨來裝配。即小之如人力車，三輪車，腳踏車，也沒有一輛是純粹的國貨。至於汽油，機油，國產品還小得無可計數，那是有目共覩之事。幸而帆船，民船，手車之類，還沒有完全淘汰淨盡，倘使物質文明再進一步，這些古老的交通器具完全絕跡，那麼，出門一步，就非仰仗外貨不可了！</p>
<p>以上衣食住行四類，大抵還是輕工業製品，或竟是未加工的農產品，然而洋貨斷檔，無法補充，便有岌岌不可終日之勢。他若國防工業，機械工業，化學工業等，除掉洋貨接濟外，竟有跬步難行之慨。從整個的經濟界，產業界看來，這是何等嚴重之事！</p>
<p>在這工商業十分危迫的時候，各方都知道有從速挽救的必要，我們也盼望這些挽救的工作，劍及履及，能切實地展開起來。不過單救目前，還是治標的末策。我們盼望：一面治標，一面莫忘治本。總要各種產業，根本上站得住，各種重要工業和民生日用品迅速地發展，能達到自給自足，無求於人的地步，那才算真正的經濟建設。</p>

<h3>英美開始新行動籌組西臨時政府　本班牙共和總理離美赴歐前表示必要時決使用武力迫弗朗哥下臺</h3>
<p>〔本報倫敦特派員十八日專電〕據英國政府方面消息：英駐西班牙外交代表團正在活動組織西班牙臨時聯合政府，以代弗郞哥政權，俟大選舉行後，再行選出正式政府。英代表團今日起已與西班牙各政黨領袖開始談判，對象包括右翼及左翼巾庸份子，但拒絕極端份子參加。據英政府方面續稱：美國參與上項活動，已在意中。至於英方如何推翻弗朗哥政權，未能獲悉。但據消息靈通方面稱：目前西班牙軍隊已不支持弗朗哥，英美擬在此方面着手，以西班牙軍隊爲支持新政府之主要因素。又據權威觀察家稱：英美此次在西班牙活動組織親英美政府，擬對付蘇聯企圖在西成立左翼政權之陰謀。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十七日電〕西班牙共和國流亡政府領袖季拉爾，今日啓程赴巴黎前談稱：弗朗哥倘不自動下野，西班牙人民不得不用武力加以驅逐，但弗朗哥倘若交出權力，則西班牙可免內戰云。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯外交政策范登堡決予支持對遠東問題兩黨意見稍有出入</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十七日電〕美國出席聯大會代表范登堡參議員，本日自紐約返抵此間後，向報界發表談話稱，四國外長定於來年三月十日在莫斯科舉行會議時，本人不擬隨同貝爾納斯前往出席，但此並非本人不贊同貝爾納斯所採取之政策之謂。反之，余對於貝爾納斯所採取之外交政策，完全表示贊同，並將繼續于以支特，至於美國於一九四八年選舉總統時，本人並不擬參加競選。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕將任下屆參院外委會王席之共和黨外交事務領袖范登堡今日穴稱：外界對於美國所謂兩黨外交政策之名辭，頗有誤解，其實其意並非共和黨對於國務鄉貝爾納斯之一切外交政策均表同意之謂，兩黨已成立協議之外交政策，僅包括聯合國機構事務及歐洲和的之談判，其他如巴勒斯坦·關稅·拉丁美洲及遠東等外交問題，兩黨意見未必相同。惟范登堡復表示，相信美國戰後外交政策之基礎，已穩固建立，並謂將繼續盡力維持圑結之美國外交政策。爲美國之利益計，當繼續支持貝爾納斯關於歐洲和的，建立集體安全制及聯合國機構之政策，但渠最後復特別聲明，共和黨對於政府之巴勒斯坦政策，不能負絲毫責任。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕國務卿貝爾納斯自紐約出席聯合國會議返京，今日招待記者報道會議觀感，盛讚四國外長會議及聯合國犬會之成就，同時發出警吿，以爲此種進步及各大國間意見趨於一致，並非即謂一切困難統經解除。最可令人欣慰者，要爲四外長已允指派代表準備對德奧和的，俾四國外長明年三月在莫斯科舉行會議時即可直接檢討。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十七日電〕一新時代」雜誌爲蘇聯外交政策之權威刋物，今日論討各大國於一九四六年協商國際問題之種種努力，對蘇聯與西方國家合作之展望，深表樂觀。據稱：本年巾帝國主義派反動份子，雖有强以一國意見加於他國之趨向，而國際間民主合作之新方式，則已獲有絕木成績·各國對於全部具體問題，雖有矛盾，然以戰爭之經騐，顯示凡愛好自由之民族，其政治社會制度與主義，雖有不同，必能覓得一公共喉舌，與解決矛盾之法，母庸驚慌。每一方面必須　開若干要求，而集中其最大努力於某種方案之合作，此種方案當爲其他共事者所能一致接受。最近四國外長會議完成五國和約所獲之進步，證明戰後問題之建設性解決方法，即在由大國談判成立協議，此與巴黎和會所採用之表決方法顯然不同。</p>

<h3>原子能委會討論美建議</h3>
<p>決延至廿日提付表決</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十七日電〕關於美國就管制原子能問題所提出之建議，頃由聯合國原子能委會加以討論，俾決定該會是否將此項建議提交安全理事會討論。依照美國所提出之建議，原子能委會於十二月卅一日向安理會提出報吿時，應提議設立國際管制制度。至有關各國簽訂條約，支持國際管制計劃時開始付諸實施。該項條約應規定設立一國際原子能發展機關，授予管制原子能之權力，對於礦石之開採，以及製造方法與用途等均有管制之權。此一機關並有派遺代表往各處視察之權，任何國家製造，保留或使用原子武器，均在禁止之列。現行原子炸彈之處置辦法，亦應花條約中加以規定，任何國家違反條約均將以國際罪行論，並將予以懲處。美代表巴魯克本日在原子能委會中敦促各國代表將美國之建議提付表決，並謂：吾人在言論之後繼之以行動，此其時矣。聯大會討論裁軍問題，已爲全體會員國一致表示支持裁軍方案，而宣吿結束，此舉對於目前之世界人民以及吾人之後代，均將發生重大之影響，故在歷史上實具有極重大之意義。聯合國大會旣已通過裁軍方案，故吾人自應加緊通過原子能之管制計　。至此，英國·加拿大及澳洲等國代表相繼起立發言，均要求原子能委會通過美國之建議，荷代表范克萊芬斯則謂，美國對於管制原子能所提出之建議與聯大會所通過之裁軍方案，絕不互相牴觸，中國及巴西兩國代表亦認爲美國之建議應予通過，並有採取迅速行動之必要。法代表在原則上表示贊同，但提議美國之建議應按章加以研究。此在蘇代表葛羅米柯則要求假以時間，俾研究美國之建議，並謂余並不認爲聯大會所通過之裁軍案與美國之建議完全平行，尤其關於否決權問題，裁軍方案並未提及云。最後美代表巴魯克同意將其所提出之建議，延期至本月廿日提付表決，俾蘇代表獲得充分之時間加以研究。</p>

<h3>英國外交政策（下）</h3>
<p>— 卡爾教授著　本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>外交政策和貿易政策具有密切的關係，英國在外交方面要在美蘇間尋求平衡，貿易方面安在進出口間尋求平衡，換言之，即實行計劃經濟。</p>
<p>英國外交政策的基礎之一，是她是一個需要大宗進口的國家。同時亦正由於此，她必需也要是一個有大宗出口的國家。不過「出口國」一詞似乎總以少用爲妙。因爲在過去它的應用已經造成了一種樂觀的錯覺，以爲出口足以造成更多的就業。事實上這樣的想法實爲經濟學上天字第一號的謬誤。如果我們的動機在於保障人民就業，還是讓我們組織起來，使之生產我們所需要的食物和用品爲是。戰爭敎會了我們許多好的經濟學原理。今日我們如果聰見有大量國內切需的物資裝船運往外國，我們就應該知道貨物出口本身並不是一件絕對有利的事情，它是一個不能豐脫的魔障，或者更精確一點地說，是一種步向滅亡的做法。今日我們正忙於輸川本身必需的物資用以換取需要更切的東西，諸如主要食物，原料和油類，均爲構成英國出口物資的主幹。對於進口貨的需要，永爲決定對外貿易的根據。</p>
<p>債權國家變債務國</p>
<p>自從一九三〇年以後，英國對外貿易的差額顯示了一種巨大的虧累。事實上我們是在賣掉一部分國外投資用作補償，即使第二次大戰不發生，我們也已經漸漸地移上遲早總要山於償付泉源枯竭而减少進口之路。戰事不過加速了這個轉移而已。我們爲抵債入超而賣出的國外投資越來越多，由於同一原因而借的外債却日有增加。因此我們已由別國對我們負債的債權國淪爲我們對別人負債累累的債務國。今後我國出口業的任務將不止是抵償進口，而是在於淸償這些債務。假使我們希望恢復一九三九年以前的進口量，我們就必須要把我們的出口口量增加到比一九三九年以前至少多出三分之一以至一半才行。我們的增加出口運動雖然在去年獲得成功，但是事實上和達到這個數字的階段還相差極遠。</p>
<p>以前我曾經說過，在政治上英國需要計劃外交政策的重要性。基於上面列舉的艱苦事實，我想英國在最近數年內計劃對外經濟政策的重要性當亦不難明暸，同時英國的對外貿易大部即將由政府加以統制。我的意思並不是說我們將要抄襲蘇聯的獨占國外貿易，採取國營形式將一切對外貿易組織起來，以國家的代表直接與外國交易。同時從另一方面說來，我們也無力作奢華無管制的自山國際貿易，在十九世紀中我們國家富足曾經有能力如此做過，並且做得甚爲得利，但是今日的情形已經不容許再如此了。</p>
<p>國內施行計劃經濟</p>
<p>計劃對外貿易的另一理由是我們正在試着在國內施行計劃經濟，換言之，就是我們正在致九於全民就業和維持最低生活水準的計劃。在不加管制的國際貿易之下，金錢成爲調節和決定的因素，什麽東西最能賺錢什麽東西就最吃香。根據滬種觀念，舉一個最淺顯的例，一船波羅蜜或者魚子醬也許要比一船小麥或者食糖來得優先，國家投資的時間地點和方式完全山財政上近期的利潤決定，其對於就業情形的影響則不再能顧及·全民就業計劃和國內最低生活永準的維持根本是不能和自由國際貿易並存的。</p>
<p>因此計劃對外經濟政策的重要性現在　經不用置辯。由於對外經濟政策的終結在於進口，第一我們就應該把進口加以計劃，使無論那一個個人或者公司都不能佔到佔計小麥或是食糖，奶油或是肉類的進口量的地位，這些東西要和其他同等需要的東西如重要的工業原料要在分配上求得平衡。只有國家機關纔有權從全部國家所能担負的進口差額中通盤地決定某種物品的重要性，然後再決定如何根據進口總量來支配各種貨物的進口額。</p>
<p>國營貿易有利和平</p>
<p>另一將進口加以全國性通盤計劃管制的論據是標準貨品要整批購進，今日大多數的英國進口均採此種方式。國營機關担常這種業務常較私人企業爲佳，國營機關能够有力量大批定貨，在好幾年以前即訂立合同，並保證物價不致波動，几此對於買賣雙方的吸引力均大。如此買方買以不用担心數年以後必需品的獲得，賣方亦可得到價格合宜平穩的市塲。這似就兌國際間計劃貿易對於世界和平幸福的供獻。</p>
<p>同時在今日世界各國對於外匯均加管制的情形之下，賣方對於貨價的高低還不及對於收進貨幣的種類來得看重。例如你假使能够在購買貨價須以美金支付的美棉和貨價可用英鎊支付的埃棉中間選擇，而你又沒有足够的美金，却祗有大量的英鎊，你當然就不再十分注重於美棉，是否在理論上比埃棉便宜。決定保留少數的美金，以備購買貨價，必需以美金支付的重要物品，而用英鎊換取埃棉。</p>
<p>此外，我們出口的性質和對象亦將部分地根據對於收進貨幣種類的需要性決定。我們必需要對於能支付我們所需要的貨幣的國家出口。</p>

<h3>南京路深夜槍聲空軍警士起衝突雙方四人受傷·肇事原因細微</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」昨晩十時許，有長寗路警察分局第二股股長王德鑄，路經南京路廣西路口時，見電軍站上有穿便衣者二人發生口角，乃上前勸解，詎其中一人即將王扭住，指其硬出頭，隨即招呼停留於勞合路之空運總隊第一大隊第一〇一中隊及一〇三巾隊所屬之軍用卡車上士兵的八十餘名下車，擬將其拖至車上，王知不妙鳴警呼援，待崗警第二五五五號到來時，王乘機脫身，即電吿老閘分局，施分局長接報後，派警士十餘名馳至，詎該空運總隊士兵認爲警局故意與彼等爲難，除將二五五五號警士拖上卡車馳去外，另一輛士兵即嚴陣以待，逢至雙方發生衝突，警士爲自衛計，曾鳴槍數嚮，致有空蓮第一〇三中隊士兵劉明照（廿歲湖南人）左脚巾彈受傷，另有機械師郁阿林，官天錫受傷，而老閘分局警士第三三一四號於紛亂中亦遭毆傷。當時情勢嚴重，幸經軍憲得訊趕到彈壓始息，但有三十五名士兵旋被帶至老閘分局。事後警備部滬北區稽查所所長戚再王及空軍一〇一中隊長楊道古委派秘書副官等多人到局，會同施分局長磋商辦法，最後，二五五五號警士由空軍方面派人護送返局，至逗留局巾之卅五名空軍，亦由自己長官領回，乘汽車而返。</p>
<h3>急景凋年上海屋簷下</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕急景殘年，百業凋蔽，爲了市面不景氣，失業者的增多，因而亦影響了竊盜自殺等案數字的上升。年關近了軍警常局早自上月份起實施冬防，加强治安。十一月份的勞資糾紛已有了一百九十二起，這幾天，爲了年賞問題，糾紛便更多了。這一年一度的總結帳期，對於今日岌岌可危的中國工商界，眞是個難關。寒流已一次次　滬，但願不要把「倒風」亦帶了來！</p>
<p>上海四百萬人三分之一失業</p>
<p>儘管上海多的是高樓大厦，達官貴人，公司的櫉窗佈置得富麗堂皇，新型的汽車在街頭來往似梭，然而這華屍的外套，總掩蓋不了它內在的危機。今日擁有三百九十六萬人口的上海，據估計失業的的有一百三十五萬三千人，佔了總數的三分之一。這可怕的數字，便是今日社會不景氣現象所造成的結果。</p>
<p>這一大批失業的人，呌他們到那裏去呢？一個足以威脅社會安甯的嚴　題，擺在我們面前。說救濟，說安插，然而在今日的狀態下，何處又能容救得了這許多呢？</p>
<p>竊盜和自殺驚心的數字</p>
<p>讓我們同時來看看本市竊盜和自殺案件的數字：據統計，從本年一月到十一月所發生的自殺案件，共計九百廿四起。自殺原因以生計困難和家庭糾紛爲最多。其中尤以十一月份的八十五起，超出了各月的平均數字。再說十月份的竊案，經吿發的共計八百五十四件，刦案則共發生六十三件。十一月份的統計，因爲警局至今尙未發表，所以還不曾知這。但猜想起來，總不會和十月份相差多少。</p>
<p>社會另一角妓院與舞塲</p>
<p>再看另一統計：截至十一月底爲止，本市登記的妓院共八百五十三所。妓女共計二千三百三十七人。登記的舞塲共廿七家，舞女共計一千八百三十五人。其年齡以十六歲到廿五歲佔最多數（這是登記的數字，未登記的有多少呢？）　人，誰不想快快樂樂的生活在世界上，這一批去幹竊盜勾當，操皮肉生涯、賣笑貨腰，甚而至於不惜毁滅自己生命的人，雖不能說百分之百是被逼於生活才這樣做，但爲了不能「挨餓」亦是事實。「攤販案件」不亦包含着嚴重的經濟問題在？</p>
<p>安眠藥功罪論</p>
<p>爲了用安眠藥品自殺的人很多，警察局特爲致函社會局飭令本市新藥商榮同業公會聘知各藥房，對前來配售安眠藥品的人，必須持有醫師的正式處方，而藥房亦祗能據方配售一次，加蓋戳記，不得再行續配。此舉固然是欲防患於先，然而亦僅祗是消極的制止而已。怎樣使社會安定，人民都能樂業，纔是根治之道</p>
<p>安渡年關？</p>
<p>勝利後的上海工商界，在原料缺乏，成本過高、外銷困難，洋貨進口，高利貸等種種壓迫下，茍延殘喘至今，政府雖曾一度放長外滙率，但仍根治不了這重病。勝利至今步步上漲的物價，已使一般薪水階級人不敷出，這幾天金價美鈔的波動，無疑又將刺激物價，年關了，難道便來一塲壓軸戲？</p>
<p>在今日，有多少人正在顧慮着上海的「坍」和整個中國經濟崩潰的問題。漫漫冬夜，這在一般「冬天來了，春天還會遠嗎」的人看來，固然好像還樂觀而有把握似的，但現實是現實，年關就在眼前，我們但希望上海這都市不再多事！</p>
<h3>十大新聞評選是怎樣產生的初還決定後再經各報評定次序　從發動到完成僅卅小時</h3>
<p>〔本職特寫〕本報主辦民國三十五年的國內和本年十大新聞評選，昨天已經在本　發表了。這十大新聞是怎樣產生的呢？也許我們應該有一個報告。</p>
<p>事先，我們曾酌量「初選」了十幾個「大新聞」，取捨的標準，大槪是依據這些標準：（一）發生的時候是否轟動；（二）事件本身的重要性；（三）牽涉與影響是否廣泛。「初選」決定之後，就請本市各大報的總編輯，國內版編輯，本埠版編輯，和採訪主任，評定决序。他們在我們印好的「初選」新聞目錄上按重要性的大小，排成一到十的次序，我們便按這次序結算分數：第一條大新聞得十分，第二得九分，第三得八分，依此類推。然後就「開票」，以分數殺多的爲第一件大新聞·</p>
<p>參加評選國內新聞的三十三票中，有十九票都認一政協簽字」是本年第一件大事，結果得到二百五十七分，佔絕對多數第一位。第二「國府還都」，有六票認定爲第一件大事，分數距離相當大。第三件大事「和談」，分數和第二名很接近，有二票認他是第一件大事，但是倒有十一票認　爲本年第二件大事。第四「開放外匯」，第五「收復張家口」，第六「國大臨開會時突又延期三天」，分數相差極爲接近，紙有十分左右之差。第七是「蔣主席六十壽辰」，第八是「李公機聞一多被轉」，第九「進出口許可制」。眞是見仁見智，各有千秋，有人認爲是第一件大事，有人却根本不算牠在十大新聞之列。陳公博案是第十名—也許有人要聞是「候補」罷，那麽候補第一是「長春被　三十九日」，第二是「戴笠將軍乘繼失事」。</p>
<p>評選本埠新聞的共三十二票，倒有二十票認爲攤販糾紛是本年第一件大事、可謂一致公認。第二件軍火庫爆炸也很有意思，有十一票認牠爲本年第二件大事。而第三件榮德生被綁所得分數却和第二各也祇有幾分之差、有四位先生推選牠爲本年第一件大事。第四糧貸案，第五姜公美案，第六郁香嚴案，第七臧大二子案，一連四件都是「案」，其中倒有三件尙未審結。第八是市參議會選舉，第九是金磚案，票數接供。殿軍「上海小姐選舉」也很有趣，有四票認牠爲十大新聞中第十件大新聞，而有一位風趣的先生却說，這是本年度上海第一件大事！</p>

<h3>糧貸舞弊案初次公審被告「八缺一」　汪達人等請求交保當庭駁回任星崖加繳現金保五百萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕轟動全國之攤貸舞弊案，自上月二十三日由地方法院檢察處提起公訴後，昨日上午九時於地院刑二庭初次公審，由吳象阻庭長任審判長，吳榮材，黃光　兩推事爲隌審官。屆時吳啓華檢察官升座後，該案在押之被告王　之，荘漢章，吳　生，汪達人四人，早已由看守所提到；同時交保在外之被吿邢志剛，楊潤畬，任星崖三人，亦準時　傳出庭報到，其中僅　林未曾到庭。旁聽席上未及九時已告滿座，唯秩序甚侍。初吿律師到十二人，計郁　（王巽之，荘滿章選任），吳正　（吳蓉生選任）俞鍾駱。、（萬墨林選任），顧維熊，諱學章（邢志剛選任），鍾覺先、張光宗（楊潤　選任），王善詳，繆慶邦（汪達人選任），陸紹宗（任星崖選任），尙有端木愷律師，因在京出席國大朱到庭。審訊自九時開始，至中午十二時半始畢，歷時三小時半，第八被告任星崖加繳現金保五百萬元，第六被吿楊潤畬亦准交五百萬元現金保，第五被吿邢志剛准交原保，其餘被吿還押，改期再審。審判長首傳七被吿，分二排立被吿攔，逐一詢問姓名，年齡，籍貫後，　向律師席巾，詢問萬慕林何以不到，萬之辯護律師俞鍾　即起立呈上被吿南京來函，並答庭上稱：被吿原擬應傳到庭，惟今適國火召開大會，致不能來滬。庭論下次開庭時務必到案，否則將出拘票。</p>
<h3>檢察官起立陳述八被告所犯罪狀</h3>
<p>審訊前吳檢察官先起立陳述各被吿罪狀，略謂：第一被告王巽之曾以厚生公司名義向浙江已貸得糧款一億五千萬元，復在本市以長江公司名義貸得六千萬元，實違反糧貸辦法，且有投機操縱行爲。第二被告莊漢章爲長江公司業務主任，負採辦出售之責，將糧貸款購得之米與王巽之共同囤積，並不立即出售。第三被吿吳蓉生將政府爲穩定糧價而委託其拋售之公米一萬一千包中之一千一百九十三包銷於同業，使不能發生穩定糧價之作用，顯有操縱壟斷之嫌。第四被吿萬墨林，於取得糧貸所購辦之糧米中　報六百卅石，殊有囤積賺疑。第五被吿邢志剛冒用萬昌新名義，領取貸款。第六被吿楊潤　未得主菅機關核准，擅將萬昌新之貸款轉讓於邢志剛。第七第八被吿汪達人，任星崖身爲糧政官員，坐令糧商囤積操縱，不加千涉，置民食於不顧，殊有失政府舉辦糧貸之原旨，雖未能證貨有共同圖利行爲，然實有放縱糧商操縱囤積之嫌疑。故一併依照違反農礦工商管理條例第三十一條之罪起訴，請庭上依法從嚴處辦。吳檢察官講畢，即按次開始個別訊問。</p>
<p>王巽之</p>
<p>先詢第一被告長江公司（副總經理）王巽之，王穿藍士林布袍，布鞋，戴眼鏡、王供稱前後共經手採辦糧米王百五十一包，到滬時約四月廿六七日，其時適市塲發生混亂，奉命緩售，實無囤積之意。第二批到有一千一百五十石，但係糙米，需加工碾軋，故不能即時出售。又稱：長江公司貸款僅六千萬元，而辦米達一億元，所辦之米即時全部售去，並未囤積居奇，且糧貸審核小組規定糧商獲得持別利潤後需收歸國庫，自身仍無利可圖，故操縱囤積實爲不明眞相者之言。</p>
<p>荘漢章</p>
<p>第二被告荘漢章，爲長江公司業務主任、自稱僅一小職員而已，庭上所詢各點，甚少知情，謂一切皆需聽命於經理，對採辦之米糧出售與否無權顧問云云。</p>
<p>吳蓉生</p>
<p>第三被告吳蓉生，爲三泰雜糧行經理，供稱三泰於戰前七八年開設，今年復業，公會方面事務由渠負責，間亦由職員高卿奎跑。於四月二十一日得貸款後，共辦到米糧三千五百餘石，即絡續售去，於四月二十七日接糧政處委託拋售公米三萬擔，後奉命十天內售出五千包，實際僅賣脫四千五百三十包即停止，一切皆係奉命而行。</p>
<p>鈾圖說明：（一）王巽之（二）莊漢章（三）吳蓉生（四）邢志剛（五）楊潤畬（六）汪達人（七）任星崖（本報陸順興攝）邢志剛</p>
<p>第四被告邢志剛，成豐米行經理，自稱曾代辦軍糧十萬大包，後僅成三千包，於荳米業公會巾任常務理事，申請貸款時因額子已滿，故萬墨林允將萬昌新名下之款交渠代辦，共代辦四千萬元，二千萬元仍由萬昌新自用，餘一槪不知。其事亦未報吿糧政處。</p>
<p>楊潤畬</p>
<p>第五被告楊潤畬，係萬昌新經理，負責店巾事務，糧貸之款因萬墨林通知故由邢志剛全部領去，賺錢如何分配，亦不知情。</p>
<p>汪達人供述糧貸經過</p>
<p>十一時一刻提訊汪達人，注爲糧食部專門委員上海糧政處代理處務，庭上首命其講遠糧貸經過，汪略謂二去年十月錢市長任內即有此提議，因抗戰期中本市糧行組織業已摧毁殆盡，舉辦糧貸意在扶助恢復糧行機構，以保障本市民食。四月一日宋院長到申，召集糧食談話會，由市商會會長徐寄廎等提議辦糧食貸款，當提出糧行八家，經決定通知此八家糧行次日舉行談話，訊問各行資本，及辦糧經騐，共中成豐係商會提出，然經審查不及格。嗣由萬墨林提議八家太少，決定再由渠另外推選九家，此九家後由徐部長主持談話，成豐雖再列入，但仍遭剔除，故共核准十六家。四月四日召開第一次審核小組，決議貸款總數爲十億元，並由渠等草擬貸款辦法，當時爲獎勵競爭起見，貸款不限於米商，僅視其確有採辦能力與吾。通益。江北二公司均係李崇年所介紹，雖非米商，但有採辦能力，故核准試辦。庭上詢及四月二十七日米市塲糾紛情形，汪答：此日通益以每石三萬一千元之價格，售米五十石，當日市情已四萬餘元，故各米行搶購，致引起糾紛，糾紛起後市塲混亂，故即報吿徐部長，請示於宋院長決議糧貸之米停售，以先恢復市場之正常交易。庭上再詢四月十七日荳米業公會曾提出五十二家米行申請貸款事，汪答：確有其事，然本人見到此申請書已遲，的五月二十日以後，其時政府已不擬再舉辦糧貸。庭上再詢停售糧貸之米旣係奉命，有否簽呈等證據？汪答：佈吿底稿係徐部長手筆。並稱糧貸之款除官利三厘外，不收任何費川，如有發現可嚴州。</p>
<p>任星崖</p>
<p>最後詢任星崖，供稱彼任調節科長，負調查糧價之資，糧商登記，辦理糧貸後，又兼負查核銷量等任務，述及四月二十七日市塲糾紛事，亦如汪達人所講，並稱五月八日以後彼已因病辭戰，五月二十五日奉召至京，向徐部長報吿糧貸情形，餘無所知。各被吿詢畢，郁挺律師起立要求被吿王巽之准於交保，理由稱：王患有肺病甚重。繼又稱莊漢章患有瘡疾，亦請交保。吳正　律師亦替被吿吳蓉生請求交保稱：自吳彼捕，家處離散，厥狀甚慘。　慶邦律師亦稱被吿汪）達人請准予交保，因同一條文起訴之被吿已准交保，注應享有同等待遇。糜上聆畢，即起立宣稱：王巽之·莊漢章·吳蓉生·汪達人之交保請求應予駁回。任星崖加交現金保五百萬元，楊潤畬准交現金保五百萬元，本案改期再訊。</p>

<h3>多空肉搏　金鈔股大起大落　烚赤先升後挫　美鈔進而又退　華股起落驚人</h3>
<p>烚赤昨繼續向榮面盤進，央行仍感應付爲難，晨開三三八萬，即遭浮多了結而步降，開後不久即退至三三三萬，旋又回升至三三六萬五，於是央行倍加壓力，逐漸降爲三三一萬光景，而後轉呈徘徊，十時後央行以三三三萬五之價，配給一〇〇條，此後買戶復吿活動，供源一滯，市價立升，證券方面之游資，復來襯托，漲風又起，高價復見三四四萬，此後求供轉形肉搏，央行亦有管制，曾回小至三三五萬，近午仍穩，午後人心稍形觀望，且有剪綫之舉，是以隔日交割並無多大作爲，反見小挫，最後站三三四萬，結果較前收回跌三萬五，飾金掛三五萬二，銀元微升，唶拆銀根仍平，暗息自一角二至一角半不等。</p>

<p>本市毛紡織業，現已有半數之生產均陷停頓，倒閉者已有三廠，據業中稱：因原料大部來自國外，外匯調整後羊毛輸入受影響，而本國之山東羊毛，又因運輸不便，價反較外貨爲貴，預測年底將有大部廠商倒閉云。</p>
<h3>管制棉紗新辦法　紡管今日商討</h3>

<p>據輸管會負責人稱：該會前曾規定限制進口物資中，有一部份，頗感困難，經該會研討之下，關於第四類限制進口貨之（一）飛機零件，（二）無綫電零件，因中國並無此項出品，必須仰給舶來，故准予列入第三類，（甲）以便利進口。其他關於不需要外匯之貨品，以及已進口之貨，在某種規定之內，可以直接向海關輸入品管理處申請。同時海關方面對裝貨問題，關於在途中之貨與到達之貨，已分別予以規定，（一）在途中者，凡貨品已交輪船或飛機裝運，在到達目的地二十小時以內者，謂之在途中者，（二）已到達者，凡貨品已經裝在船上或飛機上進口後，正由駁船或汽車卸貨者，謂之已到達之貨。又聞該會將有多項重要決定，實施策劃，正由該會詳加研究中，不日即可公布。</p>
<h3>進出口業分組會議　討論限制進口問題　顏料商提出兩項要求</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕進出口業定今日舉行五金小組會議。棉花小組會議結束後，已有意見書提交輸管會，對於進口限額有所建議；對於八月二十四日啓運貨物中之原　，要求政府准許入口，聞此點政府在原則上同意。同時進口業方面希望，今後外棉之訂構，不必集中於美國一國，而致忽略其他來源，因專向一地定貨，可引起該處商人之抬價居奇，事實上現已發覺此種現象。進出口業之小組會議，近四十個，依重要性循序舉行，全部開完當在兩週之後，所得之結論及統計數字，將全部提供政府參考。至於各類進口品之限額，輸管會今日尚未完全決定。進出口業方面希望決定時務必注意實際需要量，在政府統計數字之外，並能參照進出口商公會已統計，以及民營國營工廠之需要數量。</p>
<p>本市顏料進口商經會商後，議決向輸管會要求兩點：（一）顏料對於我國之染織業爲必需品，本國旣無出產；而國外來源亦已減少，因德國不再爲顏料出產國，英國產品亦少，僅有美國尚能供給相當數量，而需要甚多。擬請將顏料提升爲一級進口品，與生產工具等量齊觀。（二）十一月十七日後訂購之顏料，一律准許進口，又悉；美國之顏料價格，因需求者眾，波動不已，據本市進口商之推測，將來可能實施出口許可證制。</p>

<p>稍爲歇了一歇，張氏又稱：「我們有這樣一個偉在的領袖，努力爲國，努力民主大業，他的身體和精神又都那樣好，國事的前途，一定很光明。同時我們還有世界最大力量的美國之帮助，並且蘇聯態度亦相當和平，只要任何方面都本着愛國心做去，中國的和平建設，一定成功！」</p>
<p>定期晋京赴津</p>
<p>張伯苓氏現住在麥陽路一座溫暖舒適之小洋房中，南開校友預爲設備。幷聞校友方面，準備在星期日舉行歡宴大會。吳市長定本星期五設宴，爲張氏洗塵。張氏定下星期晋京謁主席，幷與有關各方面接洽要公後，即赴天津。</p>

<h3>臺東行　一個被遺忘的處女地</h3>
<p>— 臺北十二日航訊　本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>台東，或稱東部台灣，是幾乎被人遺忘了的處女地。在太平洋的邊緣上，高山深水，風風雨雨，滋養着一片崎嶇，荒漠，靜僻的曠野。不單是旅客裏足，即生長在西部原野的人們，對道個地帶，也視爲畏途。　最近長官公署轉變了視野，把目光移注到這個待開墾的地區，東部台灣正像中國的西北角一樣，它不該再被遺忘。它像是台灣的一個瘤，却不能不急速施行手術。也正因爲這樣，公衆特別組織了考察國，將考察所得，作爲開發的張本。記者也就成了墾荒隊的一份子。隨團出征。</p>
<p>開發臺東　視察團作先鋒</p>
<p>台東視察團，概括了十四個單位，二十四位各有關單位的主幹，這是光復以後本省第一個有計劃性的組織，這個組織將決定東部台灣的命運，也將是開發的先頭部隊。尤其是交通方面，差不多全部總動員。由處長任顯羣率領，公路局長華壽嵩，通運公司總經理徐上珍，鐵路委員會主任委員陳淸文，廠長張鐘崧，基隆港務局長徐人壽，高雄港務局長林則彬，航業公司處長靳德明，馮法祖，鮑關芳，船長唐桐蓀，公共工程局費局長驊，主任工程師李春松葉明升，工礦處專委徐鄂雲，科長李建人，郵電管理局霍柏昌，金騰，地質研究所長畢慶昌，氣象局科長王仁煜，海洋研究所茂傳坡，民政處科長袁繼墊等，這些成員，可以說是一個最完善的考察隊，也是東台灣迫切解決問題的各主腦機關的首長</p>
<p>五日晚，我們搭上了高雄行的夜快車，在這個行程決定前數小時，曾經數度波折，原因是台南地震損壞了路面，不能通行，可是三小時後，便很快的搶修完畢，準時通車，使我們在五一〇公里的西部平野渡過了一宵，六日晨八時便登上了到台東的專軍，開始近七百公里的環島旅程。</p>
<p>南迥線上　活像春季旅行</p>
<p>在南迴綫上，我們在本島南部兜了蠻大的一個圈子。每個人都準備了羊毛衣，怕的是冬寒夜冷，可是在旅途上，每個人都認爲瘤　。南中國的氣候，在海島南端，冬天恰和北部相反，乾爆，沒有雨，多灰塵，太陽仍像是一把大傘，它蒸熱着旅者的心，它不再使人懷戀北國，我們都這樣感覺，這實是個春天的旅行。</p>
<p>南廻綫是從高雄經屏東折向林邊，省縣道交錯，十二時我們在枋蜜站吃中餐後繼續前進，由楓港折入東部大武。這裏純是憑海的石子路，日本人過去植有樹木，戰爭迫使他們砍伐了充作軍用。而從大武到大麻，却純是一個沒有開闢過的荒野：漫山遍是難生的植物，闊葉針形的樹，張着肢膀迎風招手，紫絳色的小花朶，夾着翠綠的葉瓣，乏人採擷，荒烟野漫，滿目蕭條。</p>
<p>在楓港，第七工程處長張韶初帶領了工人來歡迎。費局長很高興的給我們介紹，他說這裏到台東的一段路基，去年給颱風冲失長達十七公里，橋樑冲毁十五座，今年三月起開始修復，動員工人十五萬名，耗資達台幣二千二百萬元，到八月二十五日竣工，張處長在本島的最南端，迅速地完成了公路網的建設，現在他很感典的能搭乖最狄式的福特汽車，在他一手修筑的石子路上，風掣電駛，這是工程工作者獲致的最大報酬罷！</p>
<p>海濱夜話　縣長贊高山族</p>
<p>在一個荒僻的鄉鎭——大武，台東縣參議長們趕到離縣城六十六公里的地方迎接我們，崎嶇的缺少休息站的山路，使他來的轎車和我們脫了節，直到九時還沒看到他，這種熱誠的歡迎，實令人感泣。</p>
<p>海濱的小城之夜，今天太不寂寞，政府對台東的關心，使他們熱烈地歡迎着，從下午鵠候到黃昏。我們順沿着整齊的歡迎行列前進，在綠色火花的鞭砲聲中，聽取縣長謝眞的報吿：</p>
<p>有着十萬人口的合東縣，高山族（阿眉族）却佔有四萬四千人。有一個農業職業學校，四千五百畝作試騐塲，高山族學生佔百分之九十以上，校長也是受過日本敎育的高山族農業研究者。謝縣長鄭重地說，高山族實在是一個非但不可怕而實是最可愛最有希望的民族，田賦徵收，他們完納得最快，村容比賽也是他們獨佔鰲頭，整潔·簡單，這次全省運動會，他們所表現的成績也最優越。正如陳長官所說，高山族的優點，日本人發現得太遲了，我們現在正要盡量發掘和認識他</p>
<p>這裏台灣銀行有分行，存款達一億五百多萬，放款僅四百多萬，過去曾達八百五十萬，現在顯然是周轉不靈，希望放寬頭寸。專賣分局月入三三〇萬，準備進入山地百分之四十六，期能達五百萬，樟腦年產六萬多公斤，烟軍種植七五〇畝。縣境面積有五十四萬餘畝，內中三萬六千多畝是林野（可耕地），目前都荒蕪着，可能利用種植鳳梨，纖維作物草蔴和沙依柴拉（音譯）後者是一種闊葉的熱帶作物，美國種，已植苗六萬，專做繩索之用，是東部最有希望推廣開來的作物。</p>
<p>記者很關心高山同胞的離心力問題，不久以前合北盛傳釀成事端，據陳鶴齡秘書的吿訴，或許因配合預算須裁减三分之一的警察人員所引起的誤會，現在有近於一種邪敎，逐漸深入山地，據另一方面消息，過去日人爲維護高山族人民生活，曾劃定保留地，供給他們耕種，光復後林業機關有將部分地區租讓商人經營，致引起他們極端不滿，最近新竹。台南，都發生了這種幾釀重大事端的情形。長官已通飭注意了</p>
<p>高山族是優秀的，但也是最天眞的。他們只有一個信念，政府給他撫慰，政府答應做的，每次都得兌現，空頭一次，連過去旣有的成績也付於東流了。〔第一節完〕</p>
<h3>東臺外圍火線上</h3>
<p>— 草埝三日訊　本報泰縣記者凌松壽</p>
<p>東合城收復，剛一個多月，老百姓又聽到了隆隆的砲聲。</p>
<p>東合的收復，不消說，對共軍自然是一個嚴重的打擊，這樣一來，使得他在蘇北的命運，日趨於日暮途窮之境。記者知道共軍是不會甘心的，所以便一直在東臺等着這一齣戲的演出。</p>
<p>序幕揭開</p>
<p>果然，道一齣戲的序幕揭開了。八十三師參謀處吿訴記者，共軍在東臺外圍集中了十八個團的兵力，揚言將以全力「收復」東台。</p>
<p>「記者先生又有文章好寫了！」火爐中的炭火照紅了李天霞師長的臉，他興奮地說：「他不打我，我不打他，假如他要來一下的話，哼！十八個國，我倒要看他的！」</p>
<p>廿七日拂晚，共軍拿他在蘇北最精銳的一部——第卅一旅第一團（原第七縱隊改編）全部向東台外圍九里廳進犯。可是國軍早就準備好了，在步砲兵協同作戰的陣勢中，幾小時熾烈的砲火，共軍就撑持不住退到了丁溪鎭（距東台十六華里），及鎭東的四華里的頭總二總三總一帶。</p>
<p>他們碰到的國軍是誰？是防泰興和宣家堡的十九旅，是最先進入東台的十九旅。這可寃家碰到頭了，五十六團·五十七團的弟兄們磨拳擦掌地嚷着：「媽的！惹到老虎頭上來了，不打到丁溪草埝去，不是娘養的。」</p>
<p>國軍接着搜索前進，開始自衛的反擊，雙方前哨在潘家舍附近對峙中（距東臺十二華里）。</p>
<p>共軍也知道情勢緊張了，乃將卅一旅的第九十一·九十二·九十三三個團全部集巾在丁溪草埝一帶，準備一塲大的厮殺。</p>
<p>午後二時，記者隨李師長赴前綫視察。同行的除常高參·程副參謀長外，還有大公報記者嚴慶澍兄——但他爲了其他的任務第二天就離開了東台。</p>
<p>天上死板板地呈着灰白色，膩雖不大，但是吹得來却怪冷地。看樣子像是下雪的預兆。兩輛吉普車在公路上飛駛着，車子的顚廠，震動了每側人的心弦。</p>
<p>到了三里　，十九旅的指揮所在這兒設着，楊旅長也跳上了軍，到前綫去。</p>
<p>由於旅指揮所的電話通知，劉光宇團長知道師長到前綫來了，他站在公路旁等候著。師長下了車，他隨即報吿前方的動態。接着和記者談：「你看，他又來打了。我眞不懂，他們是什麼樣的居心，要這探地和國家民族過不去？世界需要和平，國家需要和平，我們更需要和平。記者先生請替我們想想：八年抗戰，苦也受够了，風頭也出够了，難道在勝利後的今天，還要在自家人的身上來玩道一套嗎？然而，他不允許這樣，他要來打你啊！」說着，跑着，我們到了團指揮所。指揮所設在一間茅棚裏面，光綫黯淡得很，趁着他們將領商討戰略時，我和慶澍兄出去轉了一圈</p>
<p>這兒是一片田地，屋子很少，就是草棚也僅僅是疏疏落落的幾間，士兵們都拿草桿兒架起一個帳幕式的棚，來做休息的塲所，一堆堆地分散在陣地巾。</p>
<p>士兵的一切，只有到了戰塲上才看得出。他們之中，有四五十歲的老頭兒，也有十四五歲的小孩子，他們都很天眞活潑。我們在一個小土坵上，看到一個士兵掮着一塊木板，大槪做什麼工事用的。他一面走着，一面把木板在身上打轉，嘴裏還唱着民歌。冷的風雖是吹到他的身上，可是記者相信他的內心巾是滿足的，愉快的。</p>
<p>他們很富有整潔的習慣，作戰了，新領到的棉衣難免不弄髒，他們就把衣服反着穿，或是把夏天穿的單衣罩在上面。起初記者看到以爲是另一種服裝，或是一種標誌，後來走到前面一看，才曉得是這一回事。其實到了戰場上，生命尙且不能肯定，何况是衣服？就這一點，已足够顯出他們的天眞。</p>
<p>掛彩壯語</p>
<p>記者遇到一個傷兵，剛從火綫上抬到後方，等他停下來，記者走上去問：「怎麼哪？掛彩了吧？」他指着臂上殷紅的一塊，說：「沒有什么輕傷。」記者向他說：「你們太辛苦了。」他楊起眉毛，很雄壯地說：「我們不犧牲，將還有成千成萬的同胞們要受罪啦！」記者又向他問：「前綫上怎麼樣？」他說：「他媽的！我在戰場中對準了這些狗娘養的，一槍一個，接連着放了好幾槍，一會兒我們衝上前去，不到幾十公尺，我掛彩了……」他越說越起勁，興奮得要坐起來，記者忙把他按下去。</p>
<p>薄暮時，記者隨李師長離開了前綫，槍砲聲很密地交響着。天空中的雲層更厚了，西北風從腦後刮來，記者連打了幾個寒噤。</p>
<p>一夜的西北風，刮下了潔白的雪花，廿八日午後更加密了。而砲聲却也和雪花的稱密成了正比例。記者在師部知道部隊冒惡劣的天氣，推進到潘家舍，吳家橋一綫，雪花兒飄着。「如撒鹽，如飄絮，如梨花之飛舞」，李師長關懷前方士兵的食宿，不時打電話到前面去問。</p>
<p>廿九日天氣轉晴，午餐後，記者隨師長坐汽艇到前方去。</p>
<p>融洽無間</p>
<p>記者一看到砲兵營趙炳興營長，就問他：昨天一天怎樣過的？他笑着說：「我們有的是熱血，風和雪水遠减低不了我們幹的精神。」他又吿訴記者：「士兵的士氣都很旺盛，絕沒有一點怕冷的表示。有的兵還互相說：「我們算好的了，第一錢的步兵還要拿着槍向前衝呢！』」趙營長又指着他的一座草棚和一架無綫電說：「我們官兵間之所以能融洽無間，毫無隔閡，其原因，是我們絕對與士兵同甘共苦。你看，這就是我的休息所，與士兵毫無兩樣。我們一有空暇，無綫電馬上開起來，大家來聽。但一有了射擊命令，每人又都跑到原有的崗位去。」其後，我們又邏輯地談到共產黨。趙營長說：「有些人以爲不管誰的理由長，好像自己人打自己人總有點說不過去。其實，他們不知道，誰不願意和平呢？假如不打仗，我們會跑到這兒來受風雪的侵襲嗎？可是，共產黨，他把我們當做中國人嗎？再進一步說：他也把他們自己當做中國人嗎？」</p>
<p>又到了五十六團團指揮所，這已不是前天原有的地方。</p>
<p>我問劉團長：</p>
<p>「昨天你好嗎？」</p>
<p>他詼諧地回說：</p>
<p>「好是好，就是生　紅糖茶（記者按：是用以　寒者）已去掉幾大桶了。」</p>
<p>這天的陣地是這樣的——</p>
<p>國軍已迫近丁溪·頭德·二總·三總的正面，隔河與共軍對峙，共軍呢，九十二團防草埝，九十三團防丁溪，九十一圑是卅一旅最精銳的，在頭二三總一帶</p>
<p>劉光宇圑長圓瞪着眼睛，對記者呌：「咱們的壓軸戲又到了，你看吧！」</p>
<p>三十日晨五十六圑以一個連在二總敵前渡河，佔住一個橋頭堡，掩獲工兵架橋。共軍可慌了，於是除了頭總，三總留了少許部隊外，集中九十一團全部主力來殲滅這一個連。前後衝了七次，但是經不起砲火的集中射擊，一個個地倒下了。國軍像潮湧般地渡過河五十七個向　　攻擊，五十六圑的一部轉向丁漢東露行動。同時，在丁溪正面的五十六團之力，在砲兵和空軍的掩護下，配合水上部隊，於午后四時收復丁溪，接着五十七圑對草埝採取包圍攻勢，於次日（十二月一日）午前四時四十分攻克。</p>
<p>事後，據調查，單三　一地，共軍遺屍達千餘具，這是共軍進攻東臺的精銳部隊的下塲。</p>
<p>「予打擊者以打擊！」十九旅繼東臺收復後，又給了共軍一個嚴重的教訓。</p>
<h3>吳經熊公使</h3>
<p>— 陳如一</p>
<p>我國駐敎廷公使吳經熊博士，已於前日搭「霞飛將軍」號郵船離滬，前往馬賽，轉赴任所履新。吳博士原爲當代之法學家，道德文章，舉世稱羨；茲謹撰述吳氏平生行誼數則，以餉讀者。</p>
<p>廿二歲做博士</p>
<p>吳氏以一八九日，生於浙江鄞縣。乃父葭窓公，係一儒商，爲寗波商會之首任會長。吳氐童年，即由葭窓公躬親敎導。稍長，先後卒業於翰香小學，效實巾學。一九二〇年，以第一名畢業於東吳法學院。旋即渡美，於一九二一年，即獲密西根大學法學博士，時年僅二十有二。所著「中國古代法及法理學之研究」一文，深受彼邦讀者之歡迎。當由該校敎授Dickinson　Drake及Crane三氏推薦，榮膺卡尼基國際和平獎金，乃得資送巴黎大學深造，因其成績特著，續獲獎金一年，轉往柏林大學，在著名之Stammler敎授指導之下，從事研究。吳氏又著「Holmes之法律哲學」一文，在密西根大學之『法學評論」中刋佈。一九二三年復從學於哈佛大學法學院廠德院長。吳氐乃在依利諾法學評論中，發表「龐德之法律哲學」一文·旋又應西北大學法學院院長Wigmore及Kocourek敎授之請，撰有「Stammler及其批評」一文，列入著名之現代法律哲學叢刋。旋因母校東吳法學院之邀，歸國任敎，誦習國際法，羅馬法，法理學諸科目。吳氏曾任中央研究院哲學研究員，所著「法律中之人性」一書，則列入哈佛法學叢書。</p>
<p>訂憲法功不少</p>
<p>吳氏原係法學界泰斗，早歲在美講學，　聲　坫。國府成立以還，即任立法委員，以迄於今，歷主法制委員會，外交委員會等，於我國法典之制成，貢獻極多，甚爲孫院長哲生所倚畀。中華民國憲法草案，最初即由吳氏擬稿，制憲進行之際，吳氏無役不與。國大開幕前後，吳氏參預最後之修訂工作，以供大會討論之依據。復以遴選代表，出席討論。有所言，無不深巾肯綮。此項憲草，冶各方意見於一爐，自與五五憲草精神，間有不同。十一月二十七日，中宣部舉行記者招待會，到中外記者二百餘人，吳氐出席說明制憲原委，婉轉透澈，記者無不折服。又吳氏去夏赴美，出席舊金山會議，爲我國代表團顧問。聯合國憲章之中文本，亦係吳氏主稿。中文之被採爲國際上之正式文字，實以此爲嘴矢。夫憲章爲根本大法，治平之甚，實奠乎此。吳氏之功，可謂偉矣。</p>
<p>避寇雰受洗禮</p>
<p>吳氏早年爲一誓反教徒。一九三七年多，上海淪陷，吳氏以翊贊巾樞，位居顯要，故敵僞索之甚亟。初避居於其知友袁家潢家。偶讀『聖女德蘭賽傳』一書，深受感動，乃於赴港之前數小時間，受洗爲天主敎徒，迄今已歷九戰。其信道之篤，虔修之勤，常爲敎會中人所稱道。</p>
<p>百五首　思無妄</p>
<p>抗戰期間，吳氏奉蔣主席命，重譯聖經，新約全部及舊約中之圣詠（舊名「詩篇」）均已脫稿。聖詠譯義初稿，凡五卷，都百五十首，以韵文譯成，詞藻典雅，音節鏗鏘，蔣主席於日理萬幾之餘，躬親校閱，足覘此書之名貴。業於十月間，由商務印書館問世，兩閱月間，行銷逾萬册。好評紛起，舉世推重。作者筆撰「聖詠中之人生觀」一文，略抒所見。顧吳氐自視於聖詠者，果何如歟？吳氏嘗語予曰：「詩三百，一言以蔽之日：思無邪。而聖詠百五十首，則一言以蔽之曰：思無妄。蓋聖詠爲歷代先知籲禱天主之詞，語出至誠，眞實不虛，以視吾國古代之詩言志者，又進一境者矣。</p>
<p>家人行　鄉邦在</p>
<p>一九〇六年，吳氐甫十八歲歸，伉　情篤，歷久彌固。吳氏治學從政，無內顧憂者，實以夫人之力爲多。吳氏現有子九人，女四人，年齒相距，多祗一二歲。謔者謂其爲一雙料之「多產作家」。諸子女俱先後領洗。　第歡融，弦誦不輟，堪稱模範家庭。吳氏每謂儒家所求於齊家者，時或勉强，端賴忍耐。而吳氏一家，父慈子孝，不期而然。此去羅馬，船行的需時匝月。除其長子祖霖留滬外，夫人及其餘子女，俱同行赴任所。郵船美備，賓至如歸，海闊天空，信可樂也。予嘗笑語吳氏曰：「此誠可謂全家總動員矣」。吳氐顧謂予曰：「家人同行，鄉邦猶在，蒿目時艱，曷能自已？」吳氏憂國之深，蓋溢乎言表矣。</p>
<p>美豐姿　勤讀書</p>
<p>吳氏美豐姿，佩眼鏡，時御長袍，意態自若。年近知命，望之若三十許人。讀書甚勤，多在夜深，一巻在手，樂而忘倦。其私邸在滬西極司非爾路，　藏宏富，淪陷期間，移存於某敎堂，故得保有無缺。平昔之際，獨嗜捲烟如命，日燃數十枝爲常，每執筆時，所耗允多，烟霧繚繞，而文思遂汨汨然來焉。</p>

<h3>生活藝術</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>曹孚著　開明書店版</p>
<p>這裏要介紹給靑年讀者的是一本關於靑年修養的書。但這本「生活藝術」並不同於一般靑年修養的書。我想每個人都會感到靑年無論在學術上，思想上，情緒上，態度上總需要一番修養，可是靑年自身對於修養應該有怎樣的理解，怎樣的認識，却不是任何人估量得到的。原因是要正確地把握靑年修養的意義和目標，並非那些只會寫說敎文章的人所可做到。</p>
<p>著者在「從勵志哲學說起」　一篇代序中，說明寫這些文章的動機。「生活藝術」並不是一部分章列節的修養書籍，而是集若干篇討論生活修養的文章而成。儘管文章是零篇的，但著者却抱着一個一貫的目標和思想寫下去。他的主要的觀點就在一反過去的個人主義的修義，而着眼於個人對於社會生活的適應，把傳統的個人與社會閒隔閡的錯誤矯正過來，把道德行爲在現實生活實踐中的意義和價值加以闡發。著者在過去曾譯過馬爾腾博士的一本修義書，名「勵志哲學」，給青年精神上的影響相當大，那本書對於激發青年的志氣，鍛鍊靑年的人格不能不說有特殊的貢獻，但終不免流爲個人主義一途。如果能把握一個比較正確的態度還不教有毒害，只是能抱正確態度的理解修養之道的人實在太少了。著者便把寫這些文章當作一種「救續」，所以本書所持論點此前此的譯作要進步得多了。</p>
<p>的確，「勵志哲學」縱使對靑年有鼓舞激勵的作用。但總不免敎人走向偏狹的個人的「成功」，不過假使能够濾淨了其中個人主義與市儈氣息，則無可諱言的仍有益於青年。就像强調主觀努力在個人生活中的重要性一點，便是很有價值的。</p>
<p>本書著者保留了這種優點，再給予靑年生活修　一個新的估量。他看穿了欺世媚人的修養談舞論中國的，外國的，如果把修養視爲「處世」或「應付」的世故，視爲取悅於他人的「手段」，都無異給靑年指示吹牛，拍馬，戴高帽子的虛僞欺詐的方法，敗壞青年的心術，戕賊青年的天性。近年來坊間常見有「怎樣交友」「處世之道」一類的書籍，銷路很好，一般靑年都願意出少許金錢，購得戰勝他人之術，其實這樣談修養那簡直是要把靑年都養成老奸巨滑的「世故家。」</p>
<p>還有美國式的修養談，近於市儈主義。作者要靑年抱勝過別人的雄心，要青年努力上進，好出人投地，好做「人上之人」，正如我國一般人所希冀於靑年的「榮宗耀祖」的心理一樣，完全是對於物欲的庸俗的「成功」的崇拜。把處世和待人作爲達到「成功」目的的手段，乃至講人格，講操守，也是爲了這些，如此修養，動機未免太不純正了。</p>
<p>於提高人生興趣闡揚生活藝術的見地，著者寫下這些文章。顧名思義，這書稱爲「生活藝術」也正是要改變一般人的觀念使大家認淸生活的修養是一種藝術，高尙的生活理想是美化人生所不可忽略的。講求生活的藝術，追求人生最有價值的精神生活也就是靑年修養的極致。在人生舞台上，可以看到各式各樣的角色，有巧妙的，也有拙劣的，這中間的分別在藝術修養的深淺。讓我們看這本「生活藝術」的著者站在反個人主義者的立塲所談的生活藝術吧</p>
<p>如果說本書和其他同類書有什麽不同的地方，那主要的就是根本新興的心理生的原理來討論青年間題和生活修養。著者認爲要靑年「安身立命」，必須求心理之安，使精神付所寄托。的確，靑年的苦悶，煩惱和悲哀，實在由於精神茫無歸趨。他有一段話說得極巾肯：「克治一切心理病態的最基本的方法是把自己的生命寄託於比自身更爲重要更有價值的事業與目標。除此以外一切關於克治靑年之心理病態的說敎，假使還能收效，那只是一時的止痛。鎭靜，甚至麻醉。……要在現實生活之外，別求安身立命，假使還有可能，那麽所謂立命，只是立命的象牙塔內，所謂安心，只是鴕鳥式的茍安。」從他的話巾，可以看出一般空談修養家的謬誤所在。靑年必須立志把國家弄好，社會弄好，然後才可以找到精神上拋錨停泊的地方。靑年人對於自己的職業，切不可僅看作是爲解決生計，應該激發工作的社會意義，找出人生的永久價值，形體上參加一種工作還不够，更須加上想像上與情感上的熱忱。我們非常同意著者所指出的靑年修養的最高極致：參加，推動並促一個理想的社會生活的實現。</p>
<p>同時著者又提出，目前一般談靑年修養的人，似乎只講「品格」而不講「道德」。一般人把這兩個名詞混爲一談。勇敢是我們必具的一種品格，但這種品格發展不良，量易產生惡果盜跖奸細之流不能說不勇敢，不能說沒有　量，可是他們的禍行却不合道德標準。對於滿口仁義道德的偽君子，我們固然疾惡如仇，但眞正的道德行爲我們還是要贊揚的。像發展得最完全的人格，（這人格已逐漸由倫理學的轉爲心理學的）便是我們應追求的。著者不贊成把道德行爲列成一條條的規律，他同意的是「大德不逾閑，小德可以出入」的道德修養，並指出一條靑年修養的路綫；從「外表琢磨」而品格，而這德，而整個人格修養，而廣養的文化修養。所包括的項目是：「外表琢磨「功夫，品格，道德，智育，體貌，美育（藝術），心理衛生（情緒修養）。</p>
<p>書中對於儒家的「大學之道在明明德在親民」作了一書的解釋。著者拿這話說明公德和私德。明明德即是私德，親民即是公德，二者乃一件事情的表裏，必須聯系統一起來，始能發揮道德之　極的效用。宋人將「格物致知正心誡意修身　家治國平天下」八德目別之爲兩截，上半是誠正之功，下半是治平之功。誠正可算是私德，而治平則爲公德。正心誠意之上，還有格物致知兩項功夫著者認爲格致即把握正確的思想方法對治平的道理和方法作正確的認識，所以與下面的一段還是聯貫的。著者不贊同私德與公德的劃分，他以爲事實上只有小德與大德，私人生活上的小節是小德，治平是大德、但治平又必須以正心誠意爲動境，格爲致知爲指導，所以大德是統一公德與私德的。是的，我們很同意著者的話，有價值的文化遺產不應全部廢棄，全盤抹殺，要做揚棄的功夫。除了反動而有毒的不能讓它存在，對於道德修養有關的倫理思想，正不妨「再估」其價值。</p>
<p>綜觀本書，雖係由散篇文章集成，但因寫作時抱着一個一貫的目標和獨特的觀點，所以各篇之間覺得仍是有着思想的聯緊性的。普通靑年修養中所談過的話，這本書裏都有闡述。這裏不是空論，而是現實生活巾最需要解決的問題。理論大抵基於心理學的原理，帶有人生哲學的論斷。可是又不像其他論理書寫得那麽枯燥乏味，它實在是很親切的談話。像「一個理想主義者的自供」「人生興趣」「工作」「游戲」「讀書」「戀愛」「反犬儒主義」諸篇都有新穎而獨到的見解，足以發人深省。通常修養書巾，至多只以「說教」的方式，告訴青年一些抽象的道德規律，如何立身處世，如何待人接物，如何取悅於人，如何建功立業，說來說去，只爲一己打算，只爲物欲作想，而這裏所討論的却是屬於積極性的，著者强調健全的人格，和正確的思想對於靑年生活的重要，他要靑年追求一個最高的生活理想，（理想的精神的）不但是個人德行的鍛鍊，而應更進一步激發生命之最高最偉大的價值，促進生活的藝術化，以凈化人生，美化人生。</p>
<h3>「美國與太平洋」</h3>
<p>— 孫敬治</p>
<p>李絜非著　中華書局卅五年一月版</p>
<p>繼大西洋的繁榮一躍而爲舉世所屬目的太平洋時代正開展着。美國是太平洋上東北的一個大國，自獨立以來、其歷史的演進，國家的成長發展與太平洋即發生了很大的關係。亦即他始終在太平洋國際政治舞台上扮演了一個很重要的角色。廿世紀是太平洋的世紀早爲一般有目光的政治家所公認，而至現在爲止太平洋上的風雲，列强間的角逐，尙無日不在緊張叱咤的情形下變幻。美國在太平洋上的勢力起於東北，委延而下至中太平洋之夏威夷，西太平之菲列賓，經這次大戰後又南而直到日本土東南伸展至中國大陸邊沿之朝鮮。其勢力範圍之分佈幾遍於整個的太平洋，所以美國與太平洋實有一種脫離不了的關係，無論是要研究美國被炸歷史及近世紀來太平洋上國際政治之糾紛對於美國與太平洋的一段歴史因緣是不能不明瞭的。</p>
<p>李絜非先生所著「美國與太平洋」一書他分成八個章節，第一章美國國勢發展的自然趨向—叙述美國誕生後一貫的西向運動，亦即美國與太平洋的歷史淵源</p>
<p>第二章十九世紀太平洋國際政治—叙述荷蘭·比·西班牙在太平洋上勢力之衰退，英帝國覇權之確立及日美兩國新興勢力之突起，而列强於中國大陸之競技，造成二十世紀太平洋上之復雜情勢。</p>
<p>第三章美國與中國日本的關係—自美國與中國通間關係之成立，又至日本帝國主義抬頭形成美日在中國勢力之對敵局面。</p>
<p>第四章美國在太平洋上勢力之發展—美國的西向發展在一八〇三年達密士失必河流域至十九世紀中葉達俄拉岡，一八六七年向俄實得亞拉斯加十九世紀末復獲得菲列　，夏威夷關島等海軍根據地，巴拿馬運河的開聲，又始美國與太平洋轉入了新的階段，美國在太平洋上的勢力至鞏固了基礎。</p>
<p>第五章門戶開放政策與華盛頓會議—經中日甲午戰後列强瓜分中國的野心益加厲，美國力倡門戶開放政策，促使各國確立一種對華策略，而使太平洋國際間支撑了十年的和平均勢。華盛頓會議的召開，決定了數項原則，四國太平洋協定，五國海軍公的，九國公的的訂立，鞏固了遠東的狀况。軍備的限制，更維繫了和平。</p>
<p>第六章「九一八」事變後的美國遠東政策—美國的外交政策，始終有其一貫的目的。門戶開放倡之於先，九國公的主之於後”「九一八」事變後，遠東局勢雖形劇獲，然美國始終未改他的態度；而更加强了他的政策的彈性，史汀生的不承認主義，即是一例。及至羅斯福當選總統後，美國更轉變了他的孤立主義—打破了歷史的緘默，對日本的侵略野心有了一種積極的措置與表示，造成了日美雙方各自在其政策上事實上必戰的趨勢。</p>
<p>第七章珍珠港被襲後的太平洋戰爭與戰後美國的責任—珍珠港的襲擊太平洋戰萬開端，世界兩大集圑形勢確立，德意日侵略主義軸心，及中美英等反侵略協約國家，展開了全面性的世界大戰。一九四一年一月一日，中美英蘇訂立了共同宣言，闡明作戰的共同目的及原則。至第二年一月一日，正式簽字，更有澳·比·加·等廿六國加入，這樣便奠定了各國作戰的任務及勝利的基礎。在作戰期間，美國在太平洋上始終負了很大的責任，而在戰後如何解決日本野心，協助中國建設，主持各民族的自治，太平洋上和平關係的建立，美國尙有責任在焉。</p>
<p>第八章—戰後美國與太平洋的展望—戰後的太平洋，必然的與美國關係日益密切。而在這十九個獨立國所環繞的太平洋國際圈裏，中美蘇英更佔了重要的地位，美國的勢力現在已由太平洋的北部而移至中部南部更佔了重心的地位，其今後的政策，對中美，美蘇，間關係的樹立，及太平洋上諸國之合作發展，保持太平洋上之和平，美國實已有了決定性的能力。</p>
<p>本　非先生這本書是一九四五年三月一日寫完的，今年初在巾華出版，可以算是一本新書，內容很豐富，尤其是最後三章資料更多，假使要研究歷史或者國際問題的話，很值得去買來作參考的。</p>
<h3>介紹幾種關於工業的刊物</h3>
<p>— 紹裘</p>
<p>這是一句俗不可耐的高調了「中國的工業太不發達」，可是說儘管說，又有誰眞的在復興建一設中國的工業呢。所以自巾華民一國三十五年來的中國工業，正還沒在乳良未乾的育嬰時代。而由於中國工業的不發達相聯緊的，也促成了中國工業出版界的蕭條。而這兩方面又有相互的因果。</p>
<p>因爲我是一個從事於工業的，所以最近我借着職務上的便利，我走遍了上海的工業出版界。在道裏我僅以至誠來向關心於中國工業和前途推荐這三本亟值得一看的工業刋物——工程界，紡織染月刋，　維月刋。</p>
<p>工程界</p>
<p>這是中國技術研究學會自去年勝利遷滬後十一月出版的，那時的篇幅很少，祗有報紙八開四頁，而且因爲限於經濟上的以及負責人業餘的時間的限制，所以談不上什麽的。但是在本年六月停刋了二個月後，八月復刊了，而復刊後的工程界面目全新了。在一切的一切內容，編排印刷，和稿件的問題，都有着極顯著的改進。而篇幅也擴大了不少，（十六開六十頁左右）。這果然因爲廣吿的攝擠，而增加了經濟的力量？當然它的負責人的一番努力是不可一筆抹煞的。而在這裏我將最近二期十·十一月號的工程界的內容，作一個短評；太偏重於理論以及翻譯方面，而以致對於紡織以及土木等的文字就比較少了。因爲「工業」雖祗二字，但範團是相常廣泛的，而且工程界即以這一個廣泛的名字來爲名，那末對於內容方面也應該均勻，關於工程界各方面的都應該有些。不過工程界是有着一生特色的就是插圖照片很多，這是其他工業刊物所沒有的。再說依照工程界的顧名思義爲顧及內容均勻起見，篇幅還可擴充一下。</p>
<p>纎維工業</p>
<p>這是一本紡織工業的期刊先說這一本期刊的命運是很可憐的。去年勝利十月出版以來至今天一年多，雖說是月刊，但還祗出了五期。其間且曾接連的停刊了四個月。這是因爲負責人困於時間的關係。他因爲在纖維工業裏，廣吿是又遠比工程界多起不少。纖維工業的篇幅的又較工程界多二十頁左右。而在內容方面果然很着重於纖維紡織工業。但是差不多是自英美雜誌轉載的。且插圖太少，而稿件雖很均勻，但是不够整齊。但纖維工業也有一特色，就是售價很廉，很厚的一册裝璜印刷都很大方華麗的期刊，祗售五百元。最近的一期也不過售一千元。</p>
<p>紡織染月刊</p>
<p>不但在這三本我介紹的工業刊物中是比較最好些的，而以整個的上海或中國的工業出版界來說，也很難尋出。因爲他除了一張封面及不上纖維工業來得華麗，工程界來得淸樸，而有些顯但是反單條。但在其他內容，印刷，編排取稿，方面是亟爲均勻淸晰，新頴整齊的。允其是二卷來的紡織染更有着更大的改進，而尤值得一提的。紡織染的稿件是國產的遠倍多於譯著的。這在中國工業出版界，譯着壓倒創作的今天，也是亟應值得一提的吧。最近一期的紡織染又增闢了一欄紡織工業家介紹和增加了不少照片插圖。這是很可貴的。不過他的售價似乎太貴了一些，要二千元，因爲據我的眼光來說，一般有志於工業研究的靑年學生。是買不起的。再說紡織染的廣吿數量和纖維工業的廣吿是不相上下，那末紡織染月刊爲什麼又要貴呢。還值得一提的，紡織染也有一個特色，是絕不脫期。每月十五日總准時出版。所以說來在艱難蕭條的工業出版界紡織染似乎最有前途的一個。</p>
<h3>幼童教養法</h3>
<p>— 葉今純　黃嘉音譯　本風社出版</p>
<p>記得老林有一次和我閒談起，他說：『我結婚時朋友也送我兩本關於婚後生活修養的書，我至今不會看完，可是自從有了阿冬和小胖後，爲了他們，我買了十多本關於撫育兒童的書，看後仍感對這類的知識太缺乏。』</p>
<p>我覺得這裏話也未嘗沒有理由，因爲維持室家　洽，雖有待夫婦互相努力去實　許多基本的條理，然而，由於男女間的愛好，成人對新環境的適應，有些困難究竟還容易克服，唯獨對這一般天眞的兒寫，由於我們的偏見太深，再加孩子的舉動天眞，愛好廻異，於是逐有許多關於孩子的問題，使我們無法解答，孩子有許多動作，被我們措置得不得當，至於兒童營養的注意，疾病的調護，稍涉專門的知識，若問起我們來時，我們更是瞠目不知所對，所以無怪老林要感到棘手了。</p>
<p>一般比較負責的父母，遇到這種精形時，也祇好向書本中研討，講到關於教養見童的書籍，中文和英文的，我也看過好幾本，就我所看的這一類的書，我覺得它們都不免有種種缺點，不是的太理論化，便是太專門。亦有的書多半是由外國書巾編譯而來，往往未能因宜選擇，而徒整摭雜取，致使書本巾外國味太重。</p>
<p>因爲這類的書好的不多，（實在不容易好，）所以最近看到一本差强人意的出品，很願將它推　給大衆。</p>
<p>我要說的這本書名『幼童敎養法』，係沈陳式譯，黃嘉音編校，本年十月西風雜誌社出版，全書二百另六頁，售價三千元。</p>
<p>『幼童敎養法』的原文是美國政府勞工部兒童局編的，出版後曾經數次修訂，參加編修的有美國各大醫院的兒童衛生專家，所以內容很實用，而編訂者也許費了一些功夫，對題材加了一番選刷，所以看後尙不感到『不合國情』，或『蹈高驚遠』。</p>
<p>全書分十一章，即『嬰兒至幼童時期』，『幼童的環境』，『保持健康免除疾病』，『疾病預防法』，『牙齒』，『食物和飲食的習慣』，『睡眠和睡眼的習慣』，『衣着』，『游戲』，『兒童的發育』，及『病孩』。每一章細述幼童身體的營養，兼及智力習慣的陶育，可以說是對『敎』『養』二者並重的。書中不重理諭，列舉方法，而方法卻都是根據正確的理論經騐寫出的。文筆淸順，閱時一些不感到沉悶，我覺得一本關於敎養免童的書，能編到這樣，已是令人很滿意的事。我更希望這本書刋行後，多經國內兒童衛生專家過目，將我國兒童比較特殊的一　問題加訂進去，使成爲一本我　最完善的兒童敎養書籍。</p>

<h3>羊羣</h3>
<p>— 路陽</p>
<p>獵犬在荒漠的沙丘上疾馳着；牠們已不必過度的警覺與戒備，像在山上一樣，衛護那些新生的羊仔。牠們三五成羣地狂嗅樹幹草根，忽又箭似的奔開去，撲向糞堆上啄食的雀羣；雀兒吃驚着飛走了，於是牠們本能地朝天長吠幾聲，聲音波動這　蕩的空間，爽朗中充滿了野性。然後舞動多毛的粗尾，踅返羊羣的行列中。牠們是多麼熱愛着故土啊！莊子底每條陋巷自幼就已跑熟了。</p>
<p>農婦們攜兒抱女地跑出來，嘮叨問詢她們底綿羊有幾只產了仔羔，有沒有被惡攫走的？羊伕子們親熱委婉地答覆着，腰插鐮刀的牧童們在一旁打哈哈。</p>
<p>現在，特意們開始做起伐柴或泥水匠的工作了；成年的羊伕子們擁着厚裘，老酒灌紅了爲風沙摧殘的皺臉，鑽進鄉村的賭窟中去。羊羣於是換了新主人，朝暾晚霞中，牧女們在莊子上把羊羣趕出趕進。</p>
<p>牧女們輕盈的影子，出沒在山坡，田間，沙丘上；羊羣溫馴地躺臥着，游蕩着；獵犬還是到處馳騁；雖然野風那樣大，更不時捲來晶瑩的雪花。</p>
<p>冬天，羊羣從山上趕回莊子來了，回到主人底茅棚柵欄中，打發這一段風雪苦寒的日子</p>
<p>農民們爭着款待羊伕子，希望羊羣在他們自己底土地上「臥田」；因爲在羊羣逗遛過三天或五天的地方，自然有豐富而新鮮的肥料留下來，明年不是更能有一個好收成？</p>
<p>風雪一遭勝於一遭的殘酷，羊身上的毛却更密更厚了，那便是羊伕子們底賭資。明年春暖花開時，他們該結夥上山「打野草」了，又是一次驚險壯麗旅行！</p>
<h3>音樂家簡史</h3>
<p>— 莫扎特（Monzart）</p>
<p>德國人，「維也納三傑」之一，爲音樂界中空前驚人之神童。他的作品　綿悱惻，輕盈柔和，一生著作極多尤有貢獻於歌劇及器樂，異壽命獨短，死時僅卅五歲。生死一七五六年，歿於一七九一年。　·天·</p>
<h3>百合花</h3>
<p>— 雪曼斯基著　劉陵譯</p>
<p>人生像是一個牧場。它有各種的彩色，許多的花在它　上面生長。在純潔之後長出了欺騙，在仁慈之後就是惡毒，仁慈跟愛情並排地哀傷。</p>
<p>於是各種的彩色淹沒了我；神秘包圍了我；人生的　影更從鏡子裏　露了出來。</p>
<p>我站着在遲疑。人生是十分容易失敗的；十分難解的；十分不可能成功的。</p>
<p>而我在一　希　和幻夢的幔子裏，在一個破壞和毀滅的大海裏，在一個流了沒有意思的　淚的無知的夜晚裏迷失了。</p>
<p>傎理在正養和正義之間旋轉着。</p>
<p>我打從一株花走到另一株花，最後我終於停留在百合花的面前。於是我用雙手擁抱着她，喃喃地道：「我愛你——因爲我崇拜具有美麗的一切。」</p>
<p>但是百合花回答，「不要跟我談愛。人生是一場永久的戰門。你必須冷靜，心硬和準備應付那種博門。但是記着切勿漏露了你底名子。出去拋頭露角，可是你的心必須掩藏着。讓它呆留在一層看不見的鎧甲底下罷。因爲祗有說出他自己底名子的人才是戰敗者，祗有傾出心肺的人才是傻瓜。因爲你是一個英雄，而英雄又是沒有名子和沒有心腸地在戰門着，所以不要談愛情或情感罷。」</p>
<p>一個英雄不回答了。</p>
<p>而我祗是敬崇花，</p>
<p>一株奇異的，白色的花……</p>
<p>雪，這麼透明的雪在白茫茫的黑衣裏。　險的白花瓣呵，爲什麼你們遺棄我？潔凈的力量之囂呵，爲什麼你們的指頭引吸星星？爲什麼你們底燃燒的月亮，在我的心上跳起了一障慾望的舞蹈呢？</p>
<p>白色裏的盲目。</p>
<p>地球的輪子在于飛躥中破碎了；我那有魔力的嘴統治着世界；我的身體是權力，智力是我的凝視——祗是月亮不轉動了。而在水晶的軌道上，我夜工權力的世界　着起先創造那世界的一樣氣力終於解體，用自己的破壞力把自身推進了毀滅；帶着死亡的面具的野心在　藏中高視關步。</p>
<p>「不，」我呌喊道，「除非雨不停地向不幸的海洋哭泣，不要強逼我接受野心罷。」</p>
<p>但是白的花瓣燃燒我的雙眼；它們那潔凈的根刺入了我的皮膚，而世界依舊存在着，依舊要活上好多個世紀。</p>
<p>「我將來有權力嗎？」我問。</p>
<p>一道火焰引起來了。</p>
<p>「還有會變成萬能者嗎？」</p>
<p>而那道火焰逐漸地在脹大。</p>
<p>「怎麼呢？」我低低地問，</p>
<p>同時火焰吞沒了我。</p>
<p>最後天黑下來，百合花凋謝了。</p>
<h3>「新演技手冊」再版題記</h3>
<p>— 田禽</p>
<p>這本小冊子在譯述期間正值敵人連續轟炸的時期，它伴隨着譯者逃過無數次的警報；躲過無數次的防空洞，終於在湘桂戰役之前得在當時大後方的文化城——桂林；出版問世。</p>
<p>記得在出版之前，靜盧兄曾來函徵求我對於書名的意見。因爲我當時照原文的字意譯爲新演技手冊（New　acting　manual）。靜盧兄認爲這一命名似乎有點兒呆板，於是他在信裏寫了幾個名字，呌我來挑選，此刻，我還隱約的記得其中一兩個，如演劇藝術十二講，演員手冊……當時，我也有我的偏見，認爲前者太學術氣，我對於後者却很滿意，所以，我回信使決定改用「演員手冊」。不久，靜盧兄發覺，「演員手冊」爲杜宣先生的譯稿佔先使用，敌而仍採用譯者原來的譯名。</p>
<p>此書出版後，仍值抗戰期間，所以，僅能行銷於西南各地，現在，勝利經年，譯者亟思再版，希望普遍就敎於全國各地的戲劇工作者。恰巧於十一月抄乘民權輪東下時，路經漢口停留五小時，當上岸赴交通路訪靜盧兄，談及再版事，靜盧兄甚表贊同。因爲拙譯紙型在湘桂撤退時幸免於難（按：上海雜誌公司於湘桂撤退時損失紙型甚多。）否則，在最近萬難再版。</p>
<p>譯名經彼此考慮後，決定改「新演技手冊」爲「演員手冊」。譯者於九日來蘇州之前；在南京接靜盧兄航函催寄，原書及再版題記，於是在欣賞江南風光之餘，特草題記，說明易名原委，以誌再版紀念。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　126</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「我這話也許你認爲不滿意，也許認爲我對你太暴虐了些，但在我個人神圣的職務上，我只能如此做。這是要你原諒的。至於第二點，我可以明白答覆你：你的行動，那是你的自由，我無法干涉。換句話說，你願意怎麼幹，就怎麼幹。不過有一句話，我得預先聲明；我本人自認是一個理志強於感情的人；你對於我的一片盛情，我十分感激，不過將來的後果如何，這個責任；還是要你自己担負。我不能比這再說得明白了。……」</p>
<p>「再有一點，我現在決意收回我的問題！……因爲我問得太拙笨，太直率，太爲難你了。……除此以外，我希望我們的談話，暫且告一個段落，就此結束。這只是我思想上的轉變，一點沒有受你的影響，你可以不必多心。最後一句話；如若可能，我預備明天回大陸去了！」</p>
<p>萍子沒有超脫日本女子的溫柔和絕對服從性的範圍，她又比一般人　　，知道鶴見的思想，有子劇烈的轉變，所以她尊重鶴見的意見，竟沒有把問題和談話拖沿下去，因知再說也是白費。五分鐘後，這一片沙灘，和那半輪冷月，恢復了大自然的密靜，把這兩個人類勾心門角的色彩，一種極不調合的斑漬，消泯得乾乾凈凈。</p>
<p>半小時之後，一部中型跑車，在松島往東京的公路上，風馳電掣地飛駛着，司機是那位野豬，坐在他身邊的是鶴見。因要避免幾個敵對集團的意外麻煩，他們二人弄了點輕易簡便的化裝，呌人一時無從辨認他們的本來面目。</p>
<p>車中，鶴見就着特別裝置的小電燈，細心檢問野豬給他帶來的各種報告。他所最注意的，當然是長幸店情勢劇變，和耀羣及小考慮的事。——從參加通　策動反正工作到失踪——。這兩件事，當然叫他的思潮和情緒，掀起了不小的一陣激蕩。在這兩件報告上，他擬定了應付的方式，批註下來，呌野豬轉交給東京組織的負責人〇十二號，按方式辦理。（辦理的方式，已經在前文岳君收到的秘密電訊內，說明過了，此處不　）。</p>
<p>報告內附有大陸總部的電報一件，命令鶴見盡可能時限內，速回瀋陽，因軍事的發展和佈置上，中國的南京，上海，武漢，香港，廣州，等等方面的諜報機關，都需要改組。命令是內參謀本部轉　，參謀本部的電訊課主任，在命令上批有「着令該員，迅速覆電，盡速行動」字樣。</p>
<p>報告中最呌鶴見興奮的一條，乃自己的東京秘密組織中，有人已將「七封秘緘」貯藏所在，探明正確，並已經準備內應工作。報告上僅有用秘語寫的兩三句話，至於這控索的人是誰，如何準備內應，等等細節，只有向野豬察問。</p>
<p>「誰把『貨品』的貯藏棧找到的？」鶴見帶着興奮的笑意問着。「貨品」當然指着「七封秘緘」。</p>

<h3>不老</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>張伯苓先生昨日自海外歸來，這位不老的老人，當我們想起他的「朝抵抗力最大之路走去」那句身體力行的名言時，不由不令人肅然起敬。</p>
<p>伯苓先生畢身從事敎育，四十年如一日，南開對於民族國家有貢獻，是無可否認的事實，假使他仍在海軍方面工作到現在，其所產生的影響，恐不致能超過他主持南開的成就罷！</p>
<p>勝利前在漢口，在重慶，在參政會裏，常聽到張先生立在主席台上發言，他的低沉的聲音，說明了他的年邁，但每個聽到他的聲音的人，很少不受感動的。可是他決不服老，除非睡倒下來，參政會從不缺席，處理南開的事務也從不中斷。</p>
<p>最使人焦慮的，就是去年春夏之間的張先生那一次重病，大家都關懷着，都在祝壽他早占勿藥，蔣主席也曾親往探視，果然，不久便痊復了。此次海外休養歸來，想身體益發健朗，工作也會格外起勁的。</p>
<p>這是一個最好的標準，從張先生的生活行爲，向我們說明着下列四事：</p>
<p>（一）有恒</p>
<p>（二）水遠年靑</p>
<p>（三）不畏難</p>
<p>（四）有事業計劃</p>
<p>我們做人，如果能具備上列的條件，還有什麽事不成，自然無往而不利了。</p>
<h3>活動電影院</h3>
<p>— 金丹書</p>
<p>「請立即裝運可容一千二百客之活動電影院一座爲要。」</p>
<p>常我們一瞧到這個字條，一定會覺得有些尷尬，但是再過幾年，這種定貨單便會像雪片一樣地飛來飛去。現在在美國加利福尼亞州，正有人在設計可容一千二百位觀衆的活動影宮。</p>
<p>這種活動電影院裏面的設備都是依照標準尺寸製造的，所以同樣的設備都能拆卸自如，互相裝配，像吉普車裏的各種零件一樣。這些可以拆動的設備包括屋架結構，屋頂，塞板，天花板，地板，座位，燈光，鉛管及內部裝修。在預定的計劃中，將更裝置能够放映無綫電的天綫等設備，那末像賽馬，棒球等有刺激性的塲面都能在觀衆的眼前展開。</p>
<h3>活動電影院圖</h3>
<p>唯一所需要的條件祗有一個簡單的鋼筋水泥三和土基礎。於是，在極短的時期中，尋常的空地上就平添了一所備有好萊塢最新頴的聲，光，座設備的影宮了。</p>
<p>計劃巾的活動影宮除預定座位爲一千二百只以外，還有八百只及一千只座位兩種。全部結構爲不銹鋼製成，內部的塞板，則爲兩層波形的金屬板合成。牆壁不論高低闊狹，主要成分慨爲石棉及石膏，經過多次防火試騐，證明絕對安全。地板，牆壁，屋頂及平頂部分，都用特製螺釘聯住，能抵禦火災及地震，而裏面的空氣設備卻非常好。</p>
<p>屋內很寬敞，所以旣舒服又便於打掃。座位墊子採用海綿狀橡皮（彈簧墊子顯然落伍了），寬闊而舒適。走廊兩壁完全採用流綫型金屬板。座位間的通路裝置小型燈光，完全裝於地板下面，不佔空間，不易損壞，便捷美觀。</p>
<p>如果你對於牆壁還嫌不十分好看，那末你還可以定買現成的幕布，立刻一套漆着美觀岡案的幕布便很快地運到，祗要裝上去就成。</p>
<p>在今日工料工資貴得驚人的上海，如果活動電影院能够立刻裝運的話，眞是再合算沒有了。通當有一千隻座位的活動影宮定價美金七萬元，在美國要建造一所能容納同量觀衆的電影院要費上美金十五萬元。</p>
<p>不用說囉，這種新發明對於人口不大稠密的小市鎭，的確是個頗大的帮助，那些渴念着要看電影的人們不用再長途跋涉了。在某一個地方放映了幾天或是幾個月，這所活動影宮便可以很容易完成它底喬遷的工作。</p>
<p>現在在設計中的活動電影院可以方便地包裝起來，所佔的地位並不怎麽大，船隻，鐵路或是三四輛普通運貨的卡車都可以裝運。</p>
<p>據專家的預算，這種「奇貨」有它廣泛的世界　塲，尤其是南美各國，中國，蘇聯最爲需要。每處預計可銷售三萬至四萬所。經過兩年苦心的研究，現在所計劃的活動電影院有它廣大的適應性，凡是從寒冷的西伯利亞一直到炎熱而潮濕的赤道區域，它都能安之若素。</p>
<p>經最近美國國家影院公司的研究，此種活動電影院可能有最新式的發音及放映設備。至於無綫電傳眞電影呢，也已經由實驗進入完成階段，祗要裝上天綫就可以了。</p>

<h3>這是英國的電氣炊具</h3>
<p>上海橫斷面</p>
<h3>「層社會」的高利貸</h3>
<p>— 張季</p>
<p>出了北四川路向凍，不遠的地方有一個小鎭。這兒是下層同胞的集中地。他們的職業大半是黃包車夫；碼頭工人·住的是草棚；但也有兩條石庫門弄堂，裏面住的是所謂比較高級的人。這兒眞是「麻雀雖小，五臟俱全」，一條小小的街道；理髮室，藥舖，當舖，小戲院，小吃店，應有盡有。它代表了一個雛形的社會。</p>
<p>爲了家鄉不能立足，和找事關係，蘇北的同胞們大量來到上海，因爲親友多集中此地，於是這小鎭上平空添了許多草棚。逃出來的人當然是沒錢的，於是許多高利貸應運而生了。他們敢用高利貸的原因，因爲他們借了錢馬上租一輛三輪車或洋車，一天倒也可以賺一萬兩萬的，慢慢的就可以還淸了。</p>
<p>談到這兒的高利貸，眞有點嚇人，利息是論日計算的，客氣點的一天算三分利，即借一萬元每天的利爲三百元，假使以月計算，即借來一萬元到月要付一萬九千元。假使你是急用的話就得出每日五分的利息。還有一　利息是每天一付的，月息五角。如借款二萬元，以後日付一千元，一月共付三萬元。本息皆淸。借款人日付千元　覺負担不重，而放款者則有數十債戶，每日收來鈔票又可放出，如此則愈滾愈多。</p>
<p>放債者多爲「地頭蛇」之流，但也並不是全打如意算盤坐享其成的，他們放款的條件是：</p>
<p>一，有職業，</p>
<p>二，有住所，</p>
<p>三，有老婆小孩，</p>
<p>放款時是債戶找上門的，收款時則必須債主親自出馬，因爲放債者知道債戶的脾氣，他們是喜歡拖個三天五天的。第一次討價時，對方要求延一天兩天，是可以通融辦理的。但第二次再不還時，則價主拿出看家本領，捲起袖口，鴨古　向後一拉，開口　馬，見物即拿。對方也就乖乖的把錢拿出來了。老於比這者，當得罪債戶後，重要放出小丑面孔將對方引笑，以免下次劉方懷恨不來借款，說來未免使人不敢相信。</p>
<p>放債者都發了財了，當然本利兩空的事也有，可是他放的數目多則十萬八萬，少則三萬五萬，現時的搬夫和車夫，只要有力氣，錢容易賺的，誰會爲了幾萬元而逃跑呢？</p>
<p>不要看不起三輪車夫，他們物質享受有時比穿長衫的好，有一個三輪車夫，數年前空身來到上海，現在自己已蓋一幢平房，買了一部三輪車，漆得雪亮，上置新毛毯，人家當然樂章乘坐，加之體强力壯，故生意興隆，當歸家休息時，則脫去工裝，換上皮袍，皮鞋雪亮，頭髪溜光，不知者則常彼爲大老闆也。最近娶妻，伊原爲小學教員，因月入不能糊口，情願嫁此日人五萬元以上之踏三輪車者。</p>
<h3>也談老太太變男人</h3>
<p>— 陸士雄</p>
<p>閱十二月十三日本談載征几君「六三老太太死後變男人」一文，其中對於性的變化，未能作肯定的緣由，茲作學理上的解釋如下：</p>
<p>大凡一個人呱呱墜地的時候，在腎上天生了了二個腎上腺，最初是很大的，的占腎的三分之一，其後年事日高，腎上腺反而縮小，大的到腎的十三分之一，方爲正常。</p>
<p>腎上腺專司人生性的關係，並且二個必須比等的大小，倘然其中一個忽然脹大起來，那末這個人在生理上立刻會起變化，所謂男變女，或女變男，或同時兼有兩性，都肇因於腎上腺脤大的關係。</p>
<p>我國人對於性的不正常，往往隱不告人，認爲非常可恥，通常稱爲晴病。我們有時從新聞中可以看到結婚後鶼　不諧，請求離異的原因，由於徒有夫婦之名。此即性的變化或失常，如尋常稱爲石女，古時亦已習見，太玄經云：「廓無子，室石女。」蘇東坡詩曰：「石女無兒蕉榖槁」。夫婦之間，倘一方面有石女或雌孵雄等一類性的特徵，不但人生幸福毫無，並且後嗣絕望。</p>
<p>一物而兼有雙性之特異者，並非限於人類，即如動物巾的蝸牛及蚯蚓，是雌雄性同生一體。植物中如榛偷等，雌雄花同生一株</p>
<p>男變女　女變男的原因，由於二個腎上腺中脹大了一個，旣如上述，所以祇須把脹大的一個割去，性的變化立刻恢復。此事已於數年前在英國的性病醫院旱經臨床實騐，確獲成功。但是腎上腺祇能劑去脹大的一個，倘二個同時割除，則不到二天便吿死亡。</p>
<p>性的變化的原因，係由一位英國柏樂司德醫師Dr．Broster．所發現，他因看到魚類的雌雄性變化而加以研究，進而至於人類生理的組織，並得到確實的治療方法。</p>
<p>至於征凡君所引那個「六三老太太，死後變男人」的事實，倘非由於上面腎上腺突然脹大的關係，即係男扮女裝而跡近「歇思的利」的病態。所謂「歇思的利」，是精神病的一種，患此者，性情怪僻而富有模仿特性，譬如她希望生個兒子，或是裝作大肚，或是由於日積月累的思慮竟亦會壯子隆起，所謂想像胎的模樣。關於「歇思的利」屬於模仿性精神病的一種，此說係由一位醫學博士從研究拉丁文的意義而得來，並曾向筆者說過。</p>
<p>我人於讀閱宮關稗史中看到太監們的沉悶和痛苦，誠然是慘無人道的措置。浙西一帶鄉村有將雄鷄遭從前太監同樣的命運，據說經此手續，該鷄肥大而肉嫩</p>
<p>我國人對於性的問題，往往諱莫如深，恥於談及。其實在戰前美國已有性敎育委員會爲中學擬訂性敎育大綱九條，應由父母教師醫生三方面分擔責任。歐洲英法等國亦曾把性教育列入國民敎材之中的。</p>
<h3>此時此地</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>防毒面具</p>
<p>南京路昨日出現呌賣「防毒面具」的美貨攤販，索價每具三千五百元。　我相信營業一定不壞，因爲新年將屆，一定有不少人，爲了貪岡便宜，把它當做玩具，贈給兒童。頗爲「意義深長」！</p>
<p>「大可效法」？</p>
<p>廣州市政當局，爲了經費支絀，聽說準備向每日經過珠江鐵橋的市民，徵收「過橋費」，以資彌補。該橋本已毀於戰禍，勝利後始修復。取諸於民，用諸於民，比較起其他的「德政」，還不忍加以責備。</p>
<p>上海市政經費向來就鬧恐慌，上海也有一條外白渡鐵橋，彷彿今年夏季裏也曾刷新油漆過，大可以以……</p>
<p>僅有的例外</p>
<p>美貨大量賤價傾銷中，本市各業均蒙影響，但是有一行業始終受不到打擊：「電車上依然保特擁擠。」</p>
<p>如果電車公司收回自辦，公開招股的話，我第一個加入。</p>

<h3>Article 1 of the General Principles of the Draft Constitution: The Comprehensive Committee Upheld the Original Draft After Reconsideration; Fierce Debate Over the Number of Supervisory Committee Members</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 18th] The fifth meeting of the Constitutional Draft Comprehensive Review Committee was held at 5:30 PM on the 18th at the Assembly venue. 113 representatives were present at the start, later increasing to 127. Chen Cheng chaired the meeting. First, Deputy Secretary-General Lei read the motion proposed by Chen Cheng and 37 others, requesting to retain the original text of Article 1 of the Constitutional Draft and to reconsider the decision of the Comprehensive Review Committee. Subsequently, at the request of Huang Shaomei, a representative from the Hubei region, Chen Cheng frankly explained the reasons for proposing the reconsideration, stating that the reason why the Assembly only reported the review results in the morning without discussing them was entirely due to the unresolved dispute over this article. Various parties held different opinions on this matter. It was heard that Mr. Chen Qitian of the Youth Party had vomited blood due to anxiety, and Kuomintang comrades had also debated this for days, but ultimately they sincerely cooperated. Therefore, he requested reconsideration to maintain the original text of the Constitutional Draft so that the meeting work could proceed smoothly and be completed. After Chen's speech, Fu Sinian first expressed his opposition, believing that the Comprehensive Review Committee had already made a decision on this point and that any changes should be proposed in the Assembly. Another group of representatives supported reconsideration. Chairman Chen then put the original text to a vote. Some representatives stood up to protest. Jiang Yiping argued: "No matter how much we compromise, the rules of procedure should be respected." Pan Gongzhan stated: "I believe that, according to legal procedures, the original draft text cannot be put to a vote directly. The reconsideration procedure should be followed first. Even if it is decided that reconsideration is permissible, the Assembly and the Review Committee must solemnly record the opinions of the minority during the discussion. The amendment proposed by Representative Fu to delete the seven characters 'of the people, by the people, for the people' from Article 1 of the original draft has already been passed. We can all still remember the reasons (cannot agree with this unclear and grammatically incorrect wording). I have already agreed with Representative Fu's opinion. Please propose a reconsideration of the change in the Assembly. Even if this committee accepts the reconsideration, the Assembly and the Review Committee must still solemnly record this opinion." (Applause) Chairman Chen immediately stopped the vote and expressed his apology for the negligence in handling this case in pursuit of efficiency, and announced the start of speeches.</p>
<p>Fu Sinian first said: "Bringing up this issue again today is not to stubbornly maintain the previous resolution to achieve my personal goals, but due to a spiritual feeling. I believe that my soul has not made any guarantees to anyone and should have the freedom to speak. I believe that reason should be clarified and should not be decided hastily by a phone call from Shanghai. This is by no means democratic politics, but genuine monarchical politics. Just now, a certain representative said: 'The French constitution also contains the phrase 'of the people, by the people, for the people,' but in the French constitution, this phrase does not involve the form of government but is only listed as the principle of its government.' The original text of Article 1 of the French Constitution is: 'France is an indivisible, secular, democratic, and social republic.' The form of government is clear and can be easily checked. (Applause) Therefore, what we are currently arguing about does not seem to be about reason. Not pursuing reason is called democratic politics. I have never heard of it. I do not expect to overturn this reconsideration motion with this reason, but only hope to include it in the record. I once strongly opposed a certain group of people pulling the constitution back to the May 5th Draft. Today, I also oppose this undemocratic meeting method in this so-called democratic assembly. Therefore, I hope to record it so that future generations can make their correct judgment and determine whether this is a democratic and free style." (Applause)</p>
<p>After Fu's speech, Jiang Yuntian rose and said: "I propose to postpone the decision on this issue and wait for all parties to sincerely discuss it further. Firstly, the role of us minority parties in the meeting can only be realized through reason and emotion in their claims. If we rely on voting rights, it is difficult to achieve any goals. This is what we do not want to do. Secondly, with such sharp disputes on this point, even if the Kuomintang uses its strict discipline to make its members abandon their claims, there will inevitably be unpleasant feelings. This is also what we do not want to do. (Applause) Thirdly, only the Kuomintang, Youth, and Democratic Socialist parties have participated in this arduous constitutional drafting work. We must pay attention to the intentions of those parties that have not participated in this work and people across the country so that our decisions can gain their agreement and acceptance. This is what the Democratic Socialist Party members hope for. Based on these three points, I propose that this issue be postponed for a vote and discussed separately." (Applause)</p>
<p>Subsequently, Chen Qitian spoke, saying that the constitutional draft review work had been going on for a year, with many twists and turns. It is impossible for several parties to completely agree on a decision on one matter. It is already a good thing to be able to make a decision and achieve general satisfaction. Our intention in participating in constitutional drafting is to formulate a constitution that the whole country can reluctantly agree to. I have been very anxious about this matter in recent days and have indeed vomited blood. I sincerely hope that the article proposed by Chairman Chiang can be smoothly supported by everyone and established."</p>
<p>At this point, those who wanted to speak rose one after another. Leng Xin rose and said: "I believe that the reasons of all parties have been explained. There is no need to engage in theoretical debates with stimulating tones. Please put it to a vote, Chairman." This was accepted by Chairman Chen, and the reconsideration opinion was passed with an absolute majority of 118 votes. The Comprehensive Review Committee's decision on Article 1 still maintained the original text of the draft: "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, of the people, by the people, and for the people."</p>
<p>After this topic, the discussion of Song Wan's work on the 17th began according to the agenda. (8) The issue of the consent rights of the President of the Judicial Yuan, Grand Justices, and the Supervisory Yuan, the organizing opinion of Article "83", and the review of the Fourth Review Committee were maintained, and the result was passed. (9) Regarding the issue of the organization of the Examination Yuan and the consent rights of the Supervisory Yuan, the organizing opinion of Article "89" was adopted and the second review result of the Fourth Review Committee was adopted and modified as: "The Examination Yuan shall have one President and one Vice President, and a number of Examination Committee members, who shall be nominated by the President (deleting "according to law" and the two characters, ) and appointed with the consent of the Supervisory Yuan." (10) Regarding the issue of the qualification and evaluation of public officials, the organizing opinion of Article 91 maintained the original draft: "The qualifications of candidates for public office" are not included in the evaluation. (11) Regarding the issue of the consent and disciplinary rights of the Supervisory Yuan, the organizing opinion of Article 95 was modified according to the review result of the Fourth Review Committee as: "The Supervisory Yuan is the highest supervisory organ of the state, exercising the rights of consent, impeachment, indictment (deleting the two characters "disciplinary"), and audit." The organizing opinion of Article 99 was modified to: "When the Supervisory Yuan exercises its right of consent in accordance with this Constitution, it shall be decided by a majority vote of the attending committee members", and both were passed. At this point, (12) the issue of the number of Supervisory Committee members was brought up again, causing a fierce verbal battle. Zhang Weigao, a representative from the Gansu region, spoke and requested to maintain the original text of Article 96 of the Constitution Draft, which stipulated five people per province and two people per city. Ren Zhuoxuan rose to oppose, saying that our country is a unitary country, and the population of each province is unequal and it cannot be a uniform rigid regulation. He advocated adopting the elastic regulation of the Fourth Review Committee, with one to five people per province and one to two people per directly administered municipality.</p>
<p>Ruan Yichen supported Zhang Weigao's opinion and explained the reasons in detail, stating: "Firstly, the Assembly has already had disputes over the issue of ethnic minorities and cannot have issues with a minority of people. Secondly, the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan are both based on population ratios, and the Supervisory Committee should follow the principle of regional equality so that each province and city can have equal exercise of the right of consent and impeachment in the Supervisory Yuan. Thirdly, the Supervisory Committee is not supervising the people, but supervising officials. Although the population of each province and city varies, the establishment of governments at all levels is roughly the same, and the number of officials is not much different, so it should not be based on population. I am a representative of Zhejiang Province, and Zhejiang Province has a large population, but I am also willing to have provinces with smaller populations participate in the Supervisory Yuan equally."</p>
<p>Li Zhongxiang, as the convener of the Fourth Review Committee, explained that the committee did not completely base on the principle of population standards when reviewing this article, but rather on the differences in the area of each province (such as Anhui Province with only seven counties) and decided on this elastic regulation.</p>
<p>Jiang Yiping said that a class of "administrative divisions" has been added to Article "111", and the reorganization of provincial regions will be carried out sooner or later. He also advocated maintaining the original text of the draft and opposed determining the number of Supervisory Committee members based on population.</p>
<p>At this point, Chen Yiyun and Wang Xiaoying also spoke for women to fight for the number of Supervisory Committee members. Chen said: "Women will definitely do a good job in supervision. (Much laughter, applause.) If the election ratio can be passed, it does not matter, otherwise the supervisory aspect should be stipulated separately." Wang advocated that the quota allocation of the Supervisory Committee members should be the same as that of the Legislative Committee members. Wang Xiaolai appealed for directly administered municipalities and occupational groups, advocating that the quota of Supervisory Committee members in directly administered municipalities should be increased to four, or at least three, and occupational elections should also be adopted. For a time, speakers were clamorous. Wang Hanzhang forcefully refuted the public opinion and loudly called for attention to the border issues, giving remote provinces an equal status, advocating maintaining the original text of the Constitution Draft. The reaction of the audience was mixed, and the tide continued to rise, uncontrollably. At 5:15, the order was greatly disturbed, and Chairman Chen announced a recess, and the conveners gathered to organize various opinions.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 5:40. Chen reported the results of the organization and explained several points of the convener's opinion: (1) The problem of large and small provinces can be naturally resolved after the reorganization of provincial regions. (2) The task of the Supervisory Committee members is to supervise officials. If politics can be clear, this system is even better, and there is no need to affect the harmonious meeting mood due to the quota issue. (3) Everyone has a career, and elections can never be extended to unemployed vagrants, and there is no need to list them separately. (4) The status of women should of course be improved, and it can be guaranteed by a gentleman's agreement, but it is not convenient to stipulate it in the constitution, and a way can be found in the election law. It was then put to a vote, and the result was passed with an absolute majority of 101 votes, maintaining the original text of Article "96" and adding a clause: "Eight nationals residing abroad" and other characters. Chen Yiyun demanded that Chairman Chen's report be included in the record. Wang Xiaoying and Wang Xiaolai declared that they reserved the right to speak at the Assembly, and the storm subsided. (13) Regarding the issue of whether the Supervisory Yuan impeaches the President and Vice President, the organizing opinion of Article "105" maintains the original text of the draft, and there is no need for special provisions. (14) Chapter 11, the provincial and county system, was changed to the local system issue, and the organizing opinion was passed by 176 votes after debate in accordance with the review results of the sixth and eighth review committees. At this point, it was 6:05, and the entire audience refused to extend the time and announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>

<h3>The Peiping-Shenyang Plane Landed in Pyongyang, Korea Due to Fog; The Soviet Side Treated Them Generously and Released Them the Next Day</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 18th] When the Peiping-Shenyang plane was flying to Shenyang on the 16th, it lost its direction due to fog and flew into Korean airspace. It landed at Pyongyang Airport when it had only 100 gallons of gasoline left. After landing, the thirty passengers on board were startled. They discovered that there were many Soviet military aircraft parked in the field, and Soviet troops came to investigate at the same time. All passengers initially thought they had mistakenly landed at the Lushun-Dalian Airport, but later learned that it was Pyongyang. The Soviet person in charge saw that there were many women and children on the plane and knew that it was a passenger plane. Although they could not communicate verbally, they were very polite. Because it was close to dusk, the plane was grounded overnight. The Soviet personnel were very hospitable and provided food and drink, which was very kind. They were released on the afternoon of the 17th. The Soviet side refueled the plane and it returned to Shenyang at 4:30 PM. Passengers included Mrs. Xiong, the director, and a section chief of the Xingyuan. According to the driver, although he knew that the situation was critical in the heavy fog, he tried his best to remain calm because he was carrying passengers and the lives of all passengers were the most important. Therefore, he did not prepare to parachute. Later, he received a ground radio to descend, and the result was Pyongyang. However, the Soviet friendship was touching.</p>

<h3>The Communist Army Intensifies Sabotage of the Peiping-Liaoning Railway; Leizhuang Station is Heavily Besieged; Fierce Fighting Also Occurs in the Peiping-Tianjin-Baoding Triangle</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Correspondent, 18th] Transportation circles report that the Communist army has recently intensified its sabotage of the Peiping-Liaoning Railway, almost every day for the past week. Starting at 3 PM on the 18th, they attacked Leizhuang Station with more than 4,000 people. The situation is unclear afterwards. The nearby National Army has rushed to rescue.

<h3>Zhang Lan Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing and Issues a Written Statement to Reporters Explaining the Democratic League's Views on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Lan, chairman of the Democratic League, arrived in Shanghai on the Long'an Wheel of the Sanbei Company in the early morning of the 18th. Those who came to welcome him included Shen Junru, Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Chen Jiakang, and Pan Zinian. Zhang immediately issued a written statement saying: "After the headquarters of the Democratic League moved to Nanjing, I had planned to come to the east for a long time. I had already gone from Chengdu to Chongqing two months ago. At that time, I wanted to come directly to the east, but I learned that the National Assembly convocation order had been issued and I was sick, so I temporarily stayed in Chongqing. This time I came to Shanghai according to the original plan, not a temporary decision. The Democratic League should not participate in the divisive National Assembly. When I was in Chongqing, I had a phone call with the Nanjing headquarters and learned that the comrades in the central government and various places all agreed with this view, which was very gratifying. As for why the Democratic League does not participate in the National Assembly and its views on the current situation, the Democratic League issued a written statement when it received reporters in Nanjing on the 24th of last month, which I completely agree with. In the future, the Democratic League should stick to its original intention, support the Political Consultative Conference, oppose the civil war, and strive for the realization of peace, democracy, and unity. It should maintain a detached and independent third-party position in mediating the armed struggle between parties and continue to make its best efforts. I am also willing to contact truly third-party figures and all peace-loving people to work together.</p>
<p>As for participating in the government, the Democratic League will not consider this matter at all before the civil war stops and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are implemented. As for the National Assembly that has been convened, I do not want to criticize the situation at all. What the people of China urgently need now is not to fight, and they must not fight in order to survive. Otherwise, all the people of China, whether farmers, workers, merchants, or students, will only end up perishing together. The War of Resistance Against Japan ended more than a year ago, and it is really outrageous to ask the people to bear the suffering of war. As for the future relationship between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Democratic League, it should wait for the decision of the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League. However, no matter what, there should be no difference in our opinions on the struggle for democracy. In the future, we must work together, whether inside or outside the League. The date and location of the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League must wait until the Standing Committee is convened before they can be decided. Mr. Zhang Dongsun may come to Shanghai to attend. Mr. Liang Shuming will not come to the east for the time being, but he is not passive. He has repeatedly discussed national affairs and League affairs with me, and our opinions are very similar."</p>
<p>Those who came with Zhang included Xian Ying and Fan Puzhai, members of the Standing Committee of the Democratic League. They are temporarily staying at Zhang Bojun's residence on Yuyuan Road. The People's Salvation National Association held a banquet to welcome them on the evening of the 18th. It is heard that the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party has also scheduled a banquet for Zhang and his party at Zhou's residence on Sinan Road on the afternoon of the 19th.</p>

<h3>Huge Traitor Executed by Firing Squad at Yuhuatai　Qi Xieyuan Executed Yesterday　Old Thief Feared Death and Was Chaotic Before Execution</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] Qi Xieyuan, a major traitor in North China, was transferred from Peiping to the capital in May of this year. After repeated interrogations, he was sentenced to death a month ago. On the afternoon of the 17th, the execution was approved by Chief of Staff Chen and authorized by the Chairman. On the morning of the 18th, reporters visited the prison and saw Qi, in the “Ren” cell number one, having breakfast of bean sprouts, tofu, and brown rice. At this time, Qi did not know that the execution was imminent. When a large number of reporters visited, the atmosphere immediately became tense. Huge traitors such as Ye Peng remained silent, and Qi was particularly uneasy, as if he knew that death was approaching. At exactly 10:00 AM, soldiers arrived at the prison to call roll and took Qi out of the prison. At the time, Qi was wearing a new blue silk coat, a melon-shaped hat, blue silk cotton trousers, black felt shoes, and grey-yellow woolen socks. He was old, bloated, and his steps were disordered. Qi immediately asked the guards, "Is today the execution?" The guard replied, "No, no!" Qi then calmed down as before. When exiting the third gate, Qi muttered to himself, "Today is Wednesday, is it to see family members?" As he was about to turn toward the family visiting room, the guard pulled him towards the exit gate. The old thief immediately realized the situation was not good. His face changed drastically and he trembled uncontrollably, with his hands tucked into his sleeves as he was dragged forward. Presiding Judge Meng Fuda, Judges Xu Zhennan, Zhang , He Guohun, and Clerk Ma Zhengqiang had already taken their seats in the court. After Qi arrived in court, he was mentally confused and did not know what to do. According to his statement: he was 62 years old, from Ninghe County, Hebei Province, and formerly a military advisor to the Peiping branch of the Military Commission. The Presiding Judge then read out the main text of the judgment: "Traitor Qi Xieyuan, colluding with enemy countries, plotting to resist our country, is sentenced to death and deprived of his civil rights for life. All property will be confiscated except for necessary living expenses for his family." The Presiding Judge then announced: "This case has been approved by the highest authorities and will be executed this morning. Does Qi Xieyuan have anything to say?" At this time, Qi had entered a state of confusion and did not know how to answer. After about two minutes, he shouted, "Qi—Xie—Yuan—Loves—His—Country!" Before he finished speaking, the judge interrupted, "Do you have anything to say to your family?" Qi again loudly replied, "Nothing to say!"</p>
<p>Writing "Will" Shaking All Over</p>
<p>The judge asked him if he had anything else to say and if he wanted to write a letter to his family. He said, "How do I write it?" The judge said that if he wanted to write, there was a place for him to write. He answered that he wanted to write, so under the guard of soldiers, at a small table in front of the courtroom door, Qi wrote two "Wills" with ink brush (see other article). At the time, he was shaking all over as he picked up the brush.</p>
<p>After about twenty minutes, he finished writing and threw the ink brush heavily on the table. Soldiers immediately tied him up. At this time, Qi's nerves were extremely tense, and he did not ask to be untied. He looked around at the audience and said, "Please everyone, this is the result of loving the country!" His words were incoherent. After being bound, he was pushed onto a large truck parked in front of the door and driven straight to the Yuhuatai execution ground at top speed.</p>
<p>Kneeling Facing North One Shot to Death</p>
<p>At the execution ground, there were already more than two thousand spectators gathered on the hillside waiting to watch the execution. After the execution vehicle arrived, the execution soldiers immediately worked with the South Suburb Police Bureau to set up a cordon. In a short time, Qi was carried to the lawn at the foot of the mountain and made to kneel facing north. Under the order of Supervising Officers Yan Houde and Wang Jingwu, executioner Yang Guangzhao fired one shot with a rifle, which entered the center of his back. Qi immediately fell to the ground. The soldiers untied him and turned his body upright. At this time, only two minutes had passed since the shooting. Qi had not yet breathed his last. His eyes gradually closed from large to small, and his face showed signs of death. A hole was torn in the front of his leather coat, and blood gurgled from the wound. He did not struggle at all, and died after another two minutes, at exactly 10:30 AM.</p>
<h3>Qi's Two "Wills"</h3>
<p>The First</p>
<p>"Qi Xieyuan is a person who loves his country, unexpectedly harmed by those who are jealous. I hope my compatriots and family members will take note."</p>
<p>The Second</p>
<p>"National affairs are extremely volatile. Compatriots should always take loving the country as the foundation. Do not let the result of my loving the country lead to something unacceptable. The struggle for national rights, the struggle for national rights, can lead to the destruction of the country and the extinction of the nation. Those who cannot give up power, even if Xieyuan dies as a vengeful ghost, will certainly fight against this. No personal matters are mentioned, that is all."</p>
<p>Four-Plank Coffin Huge Traitor is Gone</p>
<p>The audience on the mountain applauded, and the mountains and valleys echoed with the sound. The undertakers carried the pre-placed four-plank coffin and put Qi's body inside, temporarily burying it, pending identification by family members. Thus, the life of a generation of huge traitors came to an end.</p>
<p>Qi had been quite docile in the detention center for several months, but three days ago, he suddenly changed his behavior, making a fuss every day, demanding better food, claiming that coarse food was unpalatable. The guards said this might be a premonition of death.</p>

<h3>Pauley's Investigation Report Bernas Believes Should Not Be Published</h3>
<p>[United Press International, San Francisco, 18th] Reparations Commissioner Pauley told reporters today that he was extremely troubled by the publication of the confidential report he submitted on his investigation of the situation in Northeast China by a certain senator. He believed that the report could be made public, but Secretary of State Bernas believed that it should definitely not be published at this time. However, since a committee of the Senate had requested his report on the nine provinces of Northeast China, he had no choice but to comply. It is reported that Pauley's report to President Truman and Bernas stated that the Soviet Union's plunder of industrial equipment in the Northeast was based on far-reaching military strategic reasons.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Police Kicking Wang Shuixiang to Death Case The Court Cannot Pronounce Judgment The Trial is Scheduled to Resume This Morning The Defendant is Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th] The police officer Lin Xingshe, who kicked Wang Yongxiang to death, underwent a second public trial in the High Court on the morning of the 18th, with Judge Baigaole presiding. Three witnesses were first called to testify, and the hearing continued at 12:30 PM, with the defendant's lawyer arguing that the testimonies of the witnesses were muddled and could not be used as a basis for conviction. It was also stated that the deceased suffered from splenomegaly, which could rupture and cause death at any time. Judging from the circumstances at the time, the deceased actually died of illness rather than being kicked to death. The judge then elaborated on the instructions to the jurors on how to judge the case, saying that the case should be based on facts and carefully and thoroughly studied from beginning to end before a verdict could be reached, and should not be affected by any external influences or harbor any prejudices. The jury consisted of seven people, four Westerners and three Chinese. After listening, they retired at 3:10 PM. After two hours of lengthy deliberations, they finally passed a verdict of not guilty by a vote of four to three, and reported to the judge. The judge ruled that, according to British law, whether guilty or not guilty, there must be a decision of five to two jurors before a verdict can be pronounced. Therefore, it was announced that the case could not be judged, and a retrial was scheduled for the morning of the 19th. Another seven jurors were called to the court for jury duty. The defendant Lin Xingshe was released on bail of one hundred yuan pending trial.</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Yellow River Water Conservancy Plan Completion Will Electrify Four Provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong Savage and Others Survey Longmen and Hukou</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 18th] Savage and his party, who traveled 5,000 kilometers over the entire line from the Yellow River to the East China Sea to the source of the river in Qinghai Province, left Xi'an this morning to survey Longmen Hukou, and are expected to return by Christmas. According to experts, building dams on the upper reaches of the Yellow River for power generation and irrigation will greatly benefit Longmen and the Shimen Hukou, five kilometers north of it. Once completed, the power generation will reach the average level of the US TVA, enough to electrify Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, and the Shanghai, Peiping-Hankou, and Datong-Puzhou railways, irrigate 20 million mu of farmland, and allow 10,000-ton ships to travel between Fenhekou and Tongguan. There will be no floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River for fifty years. It is also said that the Zhulamaxia Gorge, Niubixia Gorge, and the Xiangxia Gorge on the border of Gansu and Qinghai in Shaanxi are planned to build dams to store water and generate electricity, which can reach a total of 600,000 horsepower. Savage does not want to publish partial preliminary conclusions before the full survey is completed. In addition, there are still remnants of the Communist army in the Shangxian, Luonan, and Chujuzhai areas on the border of Shaanxi and Henan.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 17th] The Yellow River governance advisory group led by Savage, a party of eleven, arrived here today and visited the local authorities, and immediately went to various places for inspection. They will first go to the Sanqu on the Jingwei Road, and after inspecting the Baoji Gorge, 15 kilometers east of Saiji, they will go along the highway to Hancheng and Yichuan to survey the Longmen of the Yellow River, and then go north 65 kilometers to Hukou. They will try to return to Xi'an by Christmas to avoid spending the holiday on the frozen Yellow River. Liu Zhongrui, Director of the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, will accompany them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 17th] Savage and his party visited Chairman Zhu and then rested at Huaqing Pool. They returned to the province in the evening and are scheduled to go to Longmen for work at 9:00 AM tomorrow. The itinerary of the delegation in Shaanxi has been decided. They will first go to Longmen, then to the Luo, Jingwei canals, and Baoji Gorge, and then to Henan Province. They are expected to return to the capital at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Postal Delivery in Shaanxi Has Not Improved</h3>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Newspapers Become Bi-Weekly</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 17th] After the Ministry of Communications promulgated the time limit for postal and telecommunications delivery, postal delivery in Shaanxi has not improved. The direct Xu-Shaanxi train runs once a week, but mail from Beijing and Shanghai takes 40 days to arrive here. Airmail flights have been reduced from three times a week to once, stopping in E County, and it takes two or three days to reach the urban area, so it is often slower than land transportation. Beijing-Shanghai newspapers have become bi-weekly. The First District Telecommunications Bureau manages the sending and receiving of inter-provincial and inter-regional telegrams within Shaanxi and Henan provinces, and all meet the standard speed. The Telecommunications Bureau has suggested adding a direct Shaanxi-Shanghai communication line, which would reach its destination in one hour after implementation.</p>
<h3>Our Deputy Consul to Saigon Xu Nai Went to the Four Prefectures to Comfort the People The French Side Expressed Its Commitment to Protecting Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Diplomatic sources said: France and Siam signed an agreement in Washington on October 17, stipulating that Siam would return the four prefectures to France. Our side then stated that there were many overseas Chinese residing there, and requested the French government to properly protect the overseas Chinese during and after the takeover of the four prefectures, which was agreed to by the French side. Our Deputy Consul to Saigon, Xu Nai, flew from Saigon to Phnom Penh on the 9th, and entered Madex with the French army on the morning of the 10th. Before the French army took over the area, the local overseas Chinese closed their doors and suspended business, in a state of panic. After Xu arrived, he separately visited French Army Commander Daixiongji and Khmer representative Zhu Long, requesting them to earnestly protect the safety of the lives and property of the overseas Chinese, and then summoned the overseas Chinese leaders to convey the central government's intentions. Now the market in the area has recovered and the people's hearts are stable, and the overseas Chinese have gradually resumed business. On the 11th, Deputy Consul Xu hosted a banquet for Dai Zhu and the French-Khmer military and political authorities, and introduced them to the overseas Chinese. Xu delivered a speech on the spot, emphasizing that he requested the French-Khmer authorities to pay attention to the safety of the overseas Chinese in the four prefectures in the future. Both Dai and Zhu sincerely expressed their commitment to protecting the overseas Chinese. Other provinces such as Ditou, Fenbase, and Beilai were generally peaceful, and the overseas Chinese were all celebrating their well-being. Deputy Consul Xu flew back to Saigon on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Between French and Vietnamese Troops in Hanoi The Overseas Chinese District is Safe</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 18th] After several clashes between French and Vietnamese troops in Hanoi yesterday, the tense situation has become more serious. Gunfire continued throughout the night of the 17th, and large-scale conflicts could occur at any time. On the morning of the 18th, French and Vietnamese troops engaged in fierce fighting again in the market and near the Hanoi Bridge, which lasted for about two hours before stopping. The two sides are still facing each other. Some areas of the city are under martial law. The overseas Chinese district has been completely controlled by the Vietnamese army, but so far, there have been no incidents in the district, and the overseas Chinese are all very calm and strictly neutral.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 18th] French and Vietnamese troops clashed near the Great Lake this morning, killing three French soldiers and fifteen Vietnamese soldiers.</p>
<h3>New Insecticide "Di Ding Si"</h3>
<p>Made by Taichung Sugar Factory Can Eliminate Plant Pests</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 18th] The Taichung Sugar Factory of the Resources Committee has recently manufactured "Dilis" powder, which is a powerful and effective plant insecticide, but is currently little known. This drug is made from the roots of DERTIS in leguminous plants. Mr. Machang Xian of Taipei City transplanted seedlings from Singapore in 1927 and gradually promoted planting. In 1943, the factory established the Dilis Factory to engage in the production of finished products. The current output has reached 15,000 catties per month. Dilis roots contain a toxin called ROTENON, which is 30 times more potent than lead arsenate. Regardless of the concentration, it can kill plant pests, and it also has the effect of promoting plant growth, improving varieties, and increasing yields. In 1930, the factory suffered from two pests on sugarcane, namely wireworms and termites. After using Dilis powder, it was extremely effective and is still widely used today. This drug also has strong toxicity to animals. If swallowed, it can cause death within ten minutes to three hours. Those who come into contact with it will also die within thirty minutes to six hours. A large fish three feet long can also die in its million-fold solution, so it is also an effective drug for reducing bed bugs. However, whether it exceeds the efficacy of "DDT" cannot be determined at present because no comparative research has been conducted. It is said that the natives of Malaya in the past used this plant to make poisoned arrows for fishing or hunting. Currently, Taiwan and various parts of Southeast Asia have many products. The factory has now renamed this powder product as "Di Ding Si" insecticide, with a selling price of NT$12 per pound.</p>
<h3>"Christian General" Feng Yuxiang Recounts His Rise to Fame at a Reception</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in New York, Mao Shuqing, 17th] This afternoon, General Feng Yuxiang gave a speech at a reception held at the Sino-American Christian Alliance on 77th Street here, recounting how he became the "Christian General": "When I was 15 years old in 1896, I hated Christianity and often disrupted preaching, and I even moved the preaching podium on the street in Baoding, Hebei. However, I was gradually influenced by American missionaries and finally became a Christian in 1912."</p>
<p>The chairman of the reception was Mr. Qin, the managing director of the alliance, who had served as a professor at Northwest University of China. He introduced General Feng to the Americans present. General Feng first expressed his gratitude to the United States for its assistance to our country during the war, and hoped to enhance the traditional friendship between China and the United States in order to seek lasting world peace.</p>
<p>Speakers who followed General Feng included Dr. Yang Yuanqing, former president of Soochow University, Mr. Gibson, director of the New York City Government's Department of Commerce, and Dr. Mayou, dean of Boston Theological Seminary. All emphasized developing Sino-American friendship with the spirit of Christianity.

<h3>Student Unrest at Fu Jen Catholic University</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Peiping, 18th] Two thousand students at Fu Jen Catholic University in Xicheng, Peiping, went on strike on the 17th and confined President Chen Yuan to the lecture hall. Today, all professors and lecturers at the university went on strike to show their disapproval. Earlier, last week the university announced that each student should pay a coal fee of 35,000 yuan to heat the classrooms. The students immediately held a meeting and believed that the coal fee was too high. The university declared that any student who did not pay the fee would not be given credit for the semester. All the students then staged a demonstration strike yesterday, locking the classrooms and confining a small number of professors to the classrooms, which caused the professors to feel resentment and subsequently went on strike. It is expected that this matter will continue until after the Christmas and New Year holidays.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Curing the Symptoms Should Not Neglect the Root Cause</h3>
<p>Exchanging what one has for what one needs is inherently a mutually beneficial action. In the current international relations, which are becoming increasingly close, the era of closed-door policies has long become a thing of the past. Not only exchanging what one possesses for what others lack is the normal course of international trade, but also making the best use of one's strengths and abandoning one's weaknesses is also in line with economic principles.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the fact that international relations have their ups and downs, tariff barriers have not been completely abolished, and restrictions on imports and exports, as well as remnants of domestic controls, have not been completely eliminated even in economically superior countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, whether a country's surplus products can be freely marketed and whether a country's necessities can be freely purchased are still ideals today. As for the period of military conflict, mutual blockades and traffic disruptions, leading to extreme chaos and difficulty in domestic industries, we, in China after eight years of resistance, have a deep understanding of reflecting on the past and looking at the present!</p>
<p>Therefore, although the ideal of self-sufficiency is not easy to achieve in practice, it is not necessarily completely feasible in theory. However, it is extremely dangerous for a country's economic lifeline, especially the daily necessities of the people, to constantly rely on others and be unable to provide for itself. As a result of the First World War, everyone knew that the Allied Powers failed due to bread. As a result of the Second World War, everyone also knew that the Allied Powers gained strength from production. Judging from these historical lessons, it can be seen that if a country's economic foundation is too weak and lacks the ability to exist independently, it is very disheartening.</p>
<p>As a result of unequal treaties, China's economy had long been reduced to a semi-colonial status. After the victory, although unequal treaties have been abolished one after another, the economic foundation has been damaged too much, and it has not yet recovered to this day. Moreover, issues such as currency, exchange rate, prices, transportation, and labor are all chaotic and unresolved, and the already very fragile foundation seems to be shaking completely. Here, let's cite a few examples for review.</p>
<p>The most important economic needs are nothing more than clothing and food, followed by silk and wool fabrics. Now, with the textile industry, it is said to be relatively advantageous. However, the production volume is fundamentally insufficient, and most of the cotton has to be imported from overseas. If foreign cotton is insufficient, this relatively advantageous industry will be fundamentally shaken. In recent days, the authorities and industry representatives have been discussing the issue of foreign cotton exchange settlement for days, which has been painstaking, indicating that the raw material problem is very serious, that is, the textile industry and the problem of people's clothing are very serious. It is also rumored that Japanese and Indian cloth have arrived in Hong Kong. When the news reached Shanghai, the cloth market in this city immediately fluctuated. The future of the textile industry, which is under internal and external attack, is extremely worrying!</p>
<p>The crisis in the silk weaving industry can be seen from the urgency of its loan applications and the calls for relaxed conditions. This point can also be said to be a common problem in various industries now. The most worrying thing is: (1) If Japanese rayon does not arrive, the industry is in danger of closing down. (2) If Japanese silkworm cocoons do not arrive, it is also rumored that silk reeling factories will completely stop work by the end of the year. Judging from this, whether it is the silk weaving industry or the silk reeling industry, its lifeline is completely dependent on foreign goods. And if foreign sales do not move, the silk industry will not move either, forcing the Central Trust Bureau to step in and purchase at a price. The silk fabric industry has too much inventory, and it has to rely on borrowing to survive. What a miserable thing this is!</p>
<p>The wool weaving industry is an emerging enterprise. According to the industry's report: If all operations are started, it can very well supply domestic needs. Its difficulties lie in (1) the dumping of cheap foreign goods, making it impossible to compete with them, and (2) most of the raw materials used must be imported from overseas. Now, leaving aside the first point, China is originally a wool-producing country, and the quantity is not small. The reason for purchasing foreign goods is said to be due to the length of the fibers being more suitable, and also due to less mixing, making them easier to process. Then, before these shortcomings can be remedied, the industry's raw materials must also be imported from abroad.</p>
<p>China is originally an agricultural country. Even before the war, it had to import a large amount of foreign rice every year to supplement its needs. In May and June of this year, rice prices soared. In addition to transporting Sichuan and Jiangxi rice to Shanghai for sale, the government also purchased foreign rice from Brazil and other countries to supplement the supply, just like the United Kingdom, Japan, and other countries, as if it could not do without it for a single day, which is already confusing. Apart from rice, flour is also a major food. The flour milling industry occupies a considerable position in China's modern industries. Unfortunately, domestic wheat is not enough to meet the needs. Not long ago, it once stopped work due to insufficient raw materials. In order to maintain the people's food supply and maintain this industry, the government was forced to purchase foreign rice to supplement the supply. According to this, both rice and flour, the two main foods of the people, must be supplemented by imports from foreign countries. As for shark fins, sea cucumbers, dried shrimp, canned food, foreign wine, fruits, and so on, foreign goods are everywhere, which is especially worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The most important building materials are hardware, cement, and wood. Most hardware is imported, and there are currently no domestic products that can replace it. Cement, which could potentially be replaced, is also overwhelmed by cheap foreign goods. Modern buildings must purchase foreign pine, tongue-and-groove boards, and so on. Domestic wood from Anhui and Fujian, etc., is not only insufficient to replace them, but also has surprisingly high shipping costs, making the cost too expensive, and it is still impossible to compete. The housing shortage is now serious everywhere, but the construction industry remains stagnant as before. There are naturally many reasons for this. However, the fundamental lack of domestic raw materials is certainly one of them.</p>
<p>When it comes to people's travel, the situation is even more serious. Look at trains, locomotives, automobiles, trams, ships, which one is not an imported product? At least the mechanical parts and tire parts cannot but rely on imported goods for assembly. Even small items such as rickshaws, pedicabs, and bicycles do not have a single one that is purely a domestic product. As for gasoline and engine oil, the domestic products are so small that they are negligible, which is something that everyone can see. Fortunately, sailboats, civilian boats, handcarts, and the like have not been completely eliminated. If material civilization takes another step forward and these ancient means of transportation completely disappear, then taking a single step out of the door will require relying on foreign goods!</p>
<p>The above four categories of clothing, food, housing, and transportation are mostly light industrial products, or even unprocessed agricultural products. However, if foreign goods are cut off and cannot be replenished, there is a danger of being unable to survive from one day to the next. As for national defense industries, machinery industries, chemical industries, etc., apart from the supply of foreign goods, it is difficult to take even a single step. Looking at the entire economic and industrial sectors, this is an extremely serious matter!</p>
<p>At this time of extreme crisis in industry and commerce, everyone knows the need for prompt rescue. We also hope that these rescue efforts will be carried out swiftly and effectively. However, only rescuing the present is a superficial solution. We hope that while curing the symptoms, we must not forget to treat the root cause. In general, all industries must be able to stand on their own feet fundamentally, and various important industries and people's daily necessities must develop rapidly, so that they can achieve self-sufficiency and not rely on others. Only then can it be considered true economic construction.</p>

<h3>Southwest Transportation Artery: Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Under Construction; Funding and Materials Secured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chengdu News] The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, a major artery of transportation in Southwest China, is now undergoing accelerated construction. The central government is determined to expedite the completion of the construction project. In addition to the pre-war investment of 20 million yuan jointly contributed by the Ministry of Communications, Sichuan Provincial Government, and China Construction Bank, it has now been decided that the Ministry of Communications and Sichuan Provincial Government will each increase their investment by 26 billion yuan. Sichuan Province will raise 80% of this amount through levies on grain farmers throughout the province, to be deducted from central government loans, while Chongqing City and the counties and cities along the railway will each contribute 10%. For the first phase of the project next year, the Ministry of Communications will first allocate 15 billion yuan. It is estimated that all French materials will be shipped to Sichuan by February or March of next year. The 15 billion yuan to be allocated by the Sichuan Provincial Government will be disbursed after approval by the Sichuan Provincial Assembly this month. The route follows the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, bypassing Jiangjin to Yongchuan, then bypassing Jinyang and Xindu to Chengdu. Tunnel and bridge construction is actively underway throughout Sichuan. Guang, from the Railway Bureau, is currently in Beijing negotiating the purchase of materials and will return to Chongqing within days to oversee the commencement of construction on the entire line.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chengdu News] He Beiheng, Director of the Sichuan Construction Department, recently went to Beijing to discuss the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Dujiangyan Power Plant, and the promotion of construction work in Sichuan Province with the central government. He returned to Chengdu on the 13th. According to his remarks, the central focus of Sichuan Province's construction work in the future will be on developing power industries. Regarding the Dujiangyan Hydropower Irrigation Project, an agreement has been reached with the Canadian Ambassador to China to secure a loan of 5 million to 10 million US dollars. The Dujiangyan Power Plant will adopt the plan of Canadian engineer Kirk Kirsten, with the first phase completing a 50,000 kilowatt power generation project and the second phase completing a 250,000 kilowatt power generation project. In addition, the expansion of the Changshou-Longxi River hydropower project in eastern Sichuan has also received a Canadian loan, and the construction of a 50,000 kilowatt total capacity will be completed soon.

<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou News] Lu Jingxuan, the principal of the Suzhou County Middle School, was suspected of arms trafficking. Personnel dispatched by the Changzhou Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Protection Headquarters came to Suzhou and, together with the local police局, arrested him at his residence in Fang Lane at midnight on the 14th. The next morning, he was taken directly to Changzhou for interrogation. After the news broke, various parties were extremely shocked. Our newspaper reporter continued to inquire with the relevant authorities for several days and learned that Mr. Lu was not the perpetrator but was mistakenly arrested due to the same surname and given name. It turns out that the Changzhou Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Protection Headquarters had cracked a large-scale arms trafficking case a month ago. After questioning, all the local criminals confessed that there was an accomplice named Lu Yan, who was the principal of the Jingjiang County Middle School, currently teaching in Suzhou and hiding at No. 30 Xinxue Front Street in Suzhou City, continuing his activities. The headquarters immediately dispatched personnel to Suzhou, lodging at the Tianran Hotel outside the Lümen Gate, to secretly investigate. Unexpectedly, the criminal became aware of this and immediately disappeared. By the time they went to arrest him together with the local police局, they only managed to arrest the criminal's brother-in-law. At that time, they immediately launched another investigation. Mr. Lu was mistakenly arrested because he was also known as "Principal Lu of the County Middle School." Due to the haste that night, there was no time for interrogation. The next day, he was taken to the Changzhou Headquarters. It was a routine weekend holiday. It was not until the 16th that Guo Luzhou, the commander of the Railway Protection Headquarters, personally interrogated him and realized that he had mistakenly arrested an innocent person. He was immediately released on bail by Sun Danzhen, the county magistrate of Wujin County. Now, Mr. Lu has safely returned to Suzhou, reported the arrest to the Education Bureau, and requested that the matter be escalated to uphold justice and protect his reputation. At the same time, the County Provisional Council, believing that the officers dispatched by the Railway Protection Headquarters were so muddle-headed, decided to protest to Commander Guo.</p>
<h3>Two Robberies in the Suburbs of Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 18th] Since the 202nd Division of the Youth Army took over the city defense of this county, Commander Cao Xiang, a Major General, has specifically divided the entire city of Suzhou into seven garrison areas, stationed with elite troops, so as to help each other and respond at any time, and to achieve the effect of rapid deployment. However, at the beginning of the transition, petty criminals inevitably took the opportunity to stir up trouble, resulting in two consecutive robberies at the Xieyuan Rice Shop and the residence of a Qi surnamed resident in the suburbs last night, with heavy losses. This was rarely seen in March. Cao was furious and specifically summoned the seven garrison area captains on the 18th afternoon, instructing them on various methods of arresting thieves and strengthening defense, the main point being to organize patrols, to patrol around, and to randomly check suspicious pedestrians at any time. Cao finally strictly limited the time to solve the two cases, believing that only in this way could he deter the criminals.</p>

<h3>Shanghai County Boundary Division Issue: County Residents Oppose Being Assigned to the City; Ministry of the Interior Indicates County Name Must Be Changed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Minhang News] The issue of county boundary division has been brewing for a long time. Previously, inspectors Cheng Jing from the Ministry of the Interior, Hui Jin from the Department of Civil Affairs, and Section Chief Yu from the Provincial Land Administration Bureau came to Minhang. In order to solicit public opinion, the county government immediately convened various public opinion organizations and people's groups for a meeting. All the groups unanimously advocated retaining the Shanghai County administration. After the general public heard the news, they formed teams to petition, put up slogans, and shout slogans. Inspector Cheng personally explained and comforted them before they dispersed. The next day, Director Ni and Secretary Xie accompanied them to inspect Sanlin Town in the fourth district and convened local elders and gentry to solicit opinions. After the residents of the district heard the news, they formed teams to request the preservation of the county administration, with an even more intense attitude. Fortunately, Inspector Cheng persuaded them tactfully before they dispersed. According to the reporter's investigation, the Ministry of the Interior stated that the public security situation in this county is good, and the economic burden on the people is also lighter than in the urban area. Since the people unanimously request to retain it, the government will naturally comply with public opinion. However, the county area is too small and should be expanded. The county name should also be changed to avoid confusion between the city and the county.</p>

<h3>England and America Begin New Actions to Organize Provisional Western Government. Spanish Republican Prime Minister Declares Before Leaving US for Europe That Force Will Be Used If Necessary to Oust Franco</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our London correspondent, 18th] According to sources in the British government: the British diplomatic mission in Spain is actively organizing a provisional coalition government to replace the Franco regime. A formal government will be elected after a general election is held. Starting today, the British mission has begun negotiations with leaders of various Spanish political parties, including right-wing and left-wing moderates, but refusing participation by extremists. The British government further stated: US participation in the above activities is expected. It is unknown how the British side will overthrow the Franco regime. However, according to well-informed sources: the Spanish military no longer supports Franco. England and America plan to start from this point, using the Spanish military as the main factor supporting the new government. Furthermore, according to authoritative observers: England and America's current activities in Spain to organize a pro-British and American government are intended to counter the Soviet Union's attempt to establish a left-wing regime in the West.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 17th] José Giral, leader of the Spanish Republican government in exile, said before departing for Paris today: If Franco does not abdicate voluntarily, the Spanish people will have to use force to expel him, but if Franco hands over power, Spain can avoid civil war.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg Decides to Support Byrnes' Foreign Policy; Bipartisan Opinions Differ Slightly on Far East Issues</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Senator Vandenberg, the US representative to the UN General Assembly, made a statement to the press after returning here from New York today, saying that he does not intend to accompany Byrnes to the meeting of the four foreign ministers in Moscow in March next year, but this does not mean that he does not agree with the policies adopted by Byrnes. On the contrary, I fully agree with Byrnes' foreign policy and will continue to support it. As for the US presidential election in 1948, I do not intend to participate in the election.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Senator Vandenberg, the Republican leader on foreign affairs who will chair the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the next session, said today: There is considerable misunderstanding of the so-called bipartisan foreign policy of the United States. In fact, it does not mean that the Republican Party agrees with all of Secretary of State Byrnes' foreign policies. The agreed-upon foreign policy between the two parties only includes the affairs of the United Nations organization and the negotiations on the peace in Europe. Other foreign policy issues, such as Palestine, tariffs, Latin America, and the Far East, the two parties may not have the same opinions. However, Vandenberg reiterated that he believes that the foundation of US post-war foreign policy has been firmly established, and said that he will continue to do his best to maintain a united US foreign policy. For the benefit of the United States, he should continue to support Byrnes' policies on the peace in Europe, the establishment of a collective security system, and the United Nations organization. However, he finally specifically stated that the Republican Party cannot bear any responsibility for the government's Palestine policy.</p>
<h3>US Promotes Famine Relief Campaign Truman to Issue Statement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Secretary of State Byrnes announced: President Truman will issue a statement on the US anti-famine campaign in the next two or three days.

Its report has been submitted to the White House.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Denies Exhaustion Praises Achievements of Foreign Ministers' Conference. Soviet Discussions on Boundaries Turn More Moderate</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] US Secretary of State Byrnes recently declared at a press conference: British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov have expressed satisfaction with the progress made at the conference of the four foreign ministers and the UN General Assembly, and I feel the same way. Rumors that I will submit my resignation are absolutely untrue. I have no intention of resigning or resting. (According to people close to Secretary of State Byrnes, Secretary of State Byrnes will not consider resigning until he has participated in resolving the peace treaty with Germany.) The next meeting of the four foreign ministers will be held in Moscow, and I will ask Senators Connally and Vandenberg to go with me.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Secretary of State Byrnes returned to Washington from New York after attending the United Nations conference, and today hosted reporters to report his impressions of the conference, praising the achievements of the four foreign ministers' conference and the UN General Assembly, while issuing a warning that this progress and the increasing consensus among the major powers does not mean that all difficulties have been resolved. The most gratifying thing is that the four foreign ministers have agreed to appoint representatives to prepare for the peace treaties with Germany and Austria, so that the four foreign ministers can directly review them when they meet in Moscow in March next year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 17th] "A New Era" magazine, the authoritative publication of Soviet foreign policy, today discussed the various efforts of the major powers to negotiate international issues in 1946 and expressed optimism about the prospects for cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western countries. It is said that although reactionary elements of the imperialist faction tended to impose the opinions of one country on other countries this year, new methods of democratic cooperation have achieved excellent results internationally. Although there are contradictions between countries on all specific issues, the experience of the war shows that all freedom-loving nations, regardless of their political and social systems and ideologies, will be able to find a common voice and a way to resolve contradictions without panic. Each side must abandon some demands and focus its greatest efforts on cooperation in a certain plan, which plan should be uniformly acceptable to other colleagues. The progress made by the recent conference of the four foreign ministers in completing the five-nation treaty proves that the constructive solution to post-war problems lies in the negotiation and agreement of the major powers, which is clearly different from the voting method adopted by the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
<h3>British Diplomatic Personnel to Undergo Major Changes</h3>

<h3>French Cabinet Officially Established After House of Representatives Passes Vote of Confidence. Supported by Everyone from the Communist Party to the Extreme Right Party, Main Task is to Balance Budget This Year</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] Blum's Socialist Party cabinet has officially become the fifth provisional government since the liberation of France after obtaining a vote of confidence from the House of Representatives today. Everyone from the Communist Party to the extreme right-wing Republican Liberty Party cast a vote of confidence. Out of 546 members of parliament, only two voted against. Blum told the House of Representatives that the main task of his government during its five weeks in office is to balance the ordinary budget for the remainder of the year. According to the balance sheet drafted by outgoing Finance Minister Schuman, there is a shortfall of 1.9 trillion francs in the total national expenditure of 6.5 trillion francs. At the same time, according to some political observers, the refusal of the Communist Party to serve as Minister of Defense is the first test of the strength of the Communist Party and anti-Communist factions, and it is expected that a second test will occur during the election of the President of the Republic in January. The most promising candidate for president is former Radical Party Prime Minister Herriot. During the negotiations last week, he made every effort to make concessions to the Communist Party, so he has the strong support of the Communist Party. As for the anti-Communist faction, it wants to appoint General de Gaulle as president, but it is not yet known whether he is willing to take this position, as General de Gaulle has criticized the president's powers under the new constitution.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Commission Discusses US Proposal</h3>
<p>Decision Postponed to 20th for Vote</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 17th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission is discussing the US proposal on the control of atomic energy to decide whether the commission will submit the proposal to the Security Council for discussion. According to the proposal put forward by the United States, when the Atomic Energy Commission submits a report to the Security Council on December 31, it should propose the establishment of an international control system. Implementation will begin when the countries concerned sign a treaty supporting the international control plan. The treaty should stipulate the establishment of an international atomic energy development agency, granting it the power to control atomic energy, and the power to control the mining of ore, as well as manufacturing methods and uses. This agency also has the power to send representatives to various places for inspection. The manufacture, retention, or use of atomic weapons by any country is prohibited. The disposal of existing atomic bombs should also be stipulated in the treaty. Any country that violates the treaty will be regarded as an international crime and will be punished. US Representative Baruch urged representatives of all countries on the Atomic Energy Commission today to submit the US proposal for a vote, saying: It is time for us to follow up our words with action. The UN General Assembly's discussion of disarmament issues has been supported by all member states unanimously, and the declaration of the end of the disarmament plan will have a significant impact on the people of the world today and our future generations, so it is of great historical significance. Now that the United Nations General Assembly has passed the disarmament plan, we should speed up the adoption of the atomic energy control plan. At this point, representatives from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia stood up to speak one after another, all requesting the Atomic Energy Commission to pass the US proposal. Dutch Representative Van Kleffens said that the US proposal on the control of atomic energy and the disarmament plan passed by the UN General Assembly do not contradict each other in any way. Representatives from China and Brazil also believed that the US proposal should be adopted and that swift action was necessary. The French representative expressed support in principle but proposed that the US proposal should be studied according to the rules. Soviet Representative Gromyko requested time to study the US proposal, saying that he did not believe that the disarmament plan passed by the UN General Assembly was completely parallel to the US proposal, especially on the issue of veto power, the disarmament plan did not mention it. Finally, US Representative Baruch agreed to postpone the proposal he had put forward to be voted on until the 20th of this month, so that the Soviet representative would have sufficient time to study it.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army's Atrocities in Hong Kong Rape, Massacre, Inhumanity Canadian Chaplain Testifies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] The Far East International Tribunal opened today to continue indicting the Japanese army for its atrocities against prisoners of war and civilians. Barnett, a Canadian chaplain, testified, recounting how the Japanese army attacked Hong Kong on Christmas Day in 1941, killing hospital patients and raping British nurses. It is said that Japanese soldiers came to St. Stephen's Hospital and began to kill immobile wounded soldiers with bayonets. Able-bodied patients were driven into a room. Seven nurses were taken away, and I witnessed one of them being hit on the head by a Japanese soldier. Kicked and slapped in the face. The next day, I met four of the nurses, who said that they had been raped repeatedly at night, and the other three nurses had been killed and their bodies discarded on the hospital lawn, which had been dismembered. One hundred and eighty bodies of wounded soldiers were found in the hospital, most of whom had been dismembered. Several soldiers had their ears, noses, and tongues cut off. Japanese soldiers did not allow the bodies to be buried and forced the living to light a fire to cremate them.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Policy (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Authored by Professor Carr, Specially Translated by the Newspaper Translation Department</p>
<p>Foreign policy and trade policy are closely related. In diplomacy, Britain must seek a balance between the US and the Soviet Union, and in trade, it must seek a balance between imports and exports, that is, implement a planned economy.</p>
<p>One of the foundations of British foreign policy is that it is a country that needs large-scale imports. At the same time, precisely because of this, it must also be a country with large-scale exports. However, the term "exporting country" seems best used sparingly, because in the past its application has created an optimistic illusion that exports are sufficient to create more employment. In fact, such an idea is the number one economic fallacy. If our motivation is to guarantee people's employment, let us organize them to produce the food and supplies we need. The war has taught us many good economic principles. Today, if we cleverly see a large amount of urgently needed domestic materials being loaded onto ships and transported to foreign countries, we should know that exporting goods is not an absolutely beneficial thing in itself, but an inescapable demon, or more precisely, a step towards destruction. Today, we are busy transporting essential materials to exchange for more urgent things, such as staple foods, raw materials and oils, which constitute the mainstay of British exports. The need for imported goods is always the basis for determining foreign trade.</p>
<p>Creditor Nation Becomes Debtor Nation</p>
<p>Since 1930, the balance of British foreign trade has shown a huge deficit. In fact, we are selling off part of our foreign investment as compensation. Even if the Second World War did not happen, we would have gradually moved to a point where imports would inevitably be reduced due to the exhaustion of repayment sources sooner or later. The war only accelerated this shift. The foreign investments we sell to offset the import surplus are increasing, and the foreign debt we borrow for the same reason is increasing day by day. As a result, we have changed from a creditor nation to whom other countries owe debts to a debtor nation burdened with debts to others. In the future, the task of our country's export industry will not only be to offset imports, but to clear these debts. If we hope to restore the import volume before 1939, we must increase our export volume by at least one-third to one-half more than before 1939. Although our increased export movement was successful last year, it is still far from reaching this figure.</p>
<p>I once said that politically, Britain needs the importance of planned foreign policy. Based on the arduous facts listed above, I think it is not difficult to understand the importance of Britain's planning of foreign economic policy in recent years, and at the same time, most of Britain's foreign trade will soon be controlled by the government. I don't mean that we are going to copy the Soviet Union's monopoly of foreign trade, adopt state-owned forms to organize all foreign trade, and trade directly with foreign countries as a representative of the country. At the same time, on the other hand, we also do not have the power to engage in luxurious and unregulated free international trade. In the mid-nineteenth century, our country was rich enough to do so, and it did very well, but today's situation no longer allows it.</p>
<p>Implementing Planned Economy Domestically</p>
<p>Another reason for planning foreign trade is that we are trying to implement a planned economy at home, in other words, we are committed to plans for full employment and maintaining a minimum standard of living. Under unregulated international trade, money becomes the regulating and determining factor, and whatever makes the most money is the most popular. According to this concept, to give the simplest example, a ship of jackfruit or caviar may take precedence over a ship of wheat or sugar. The time, location, and method of national investment are completely determined by short-term financial profits, and the impact on employment can no longer be taken into account. Full employment plans and the maintenance of a minimum domestic standard of living are fundamentally incompatible with free international trade.</p>
<p>Therefore, the importance of planning foreign economic policy is now beyond dispute. Since the conclusion of foreign economic policy lies in imports, first, we should plan imports so that no individual or company can occupy the position of accounting for the import volume of wheat, sugar, butter, or meat. These things and other equally needed things such as important industrial raw materials must be balanced in distribution. Only state organs have the right to comprehensively determine the importance of a certain item from the total import surplus that the entire country can afford, and then decide how to allocate the import quota of various goods according to the total import volume.</p>
<p>State-owned Trade is Conducive to Peace</p>
<p>Another argument for the national overall planning control of imports is that standard goods must be purchased in bulk, and most of the British imports today are done in this way. State-owned agencies are often better than private enterprises in undertaking this business. State-owned agencies can have the power to place large orders, sign contracts several years in advance, and guarantee that prices will not fluctuate. This is attractive to both buyers and sellers. In this way, buyers don't have to worry about obtaining necessities in the years to come, and sellers can also get a reasonable and stable market. This seems to be the contribution of planned trade between countries to world peace and happiness.</p>
<p>At the same time, in today's world where various countries control foreign exchange, sellers value the types of currency received more than the price of goods. For example, if you are able to choose between American cotton whose price must be paid in US dollars and Egyptian cotton whose price can be paid in pounds sterling, and you do not have enough US dollars, but only a large number of pounds sterling, then you will certainly no longer pay much attention to whether American cotton is theoretically cheaper than Egyptian cotton. Decide to retain a small amount of US dollars for the purchase of important items whose price must be paid in US dollars, and exchange pounds sterling for Egyptian cotton.</p>
<p>In addition, the nature and object of our exports will also be partially determined based on the need for the types of currency received. We must export to countries that can pay in the currencies we need.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Order, Ensuring Public Security, and Conducting a City-Wide Household Re-registration; Holding Training Sessions for Re-registration Personnel in Each District Before the Start</h3>
<p>The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, in view of the large population of this city and the rapid movement of people, in order to ensure local public security and maintain social order, must strive for accuracy in household registration. Therefore, it has decided to conduct a city-wide household re-registration. Before the re-registration, various publicity efforts will be made to make citizens aware of the importance of household registration. At that time, it is planned to mobilize a large number of autonomous personnel, such as all the ward chiefs and ward household registration clerks in the city, all the village chiefs in the city, and one supervisor will be sent by the Civil Affairs Bureau to each district. The heads and assistant staff of the household administration sections of each district will also be dispatched, stipulating that each person will supervise ten wards, and two police officers will be assigned to each ward to assist. Before the re-registration begins, training sessions for re-registration personnel will be held in each district. The duration of the sessions is tentatively set for two days. It is reported that during the household re-registration, the ward will be the unit, and the ward chief and ward household registration clerk will be responsible separately, each cooperating with a police officer, to supervise and re-register household by household. The re-registration period for each ward shall not exceed ten days at most.</p>
<h3>The Bodies of the Deceased from the Central Corporation Accident Transported to Shanghai by Special Plane; Lost Banknotes Will Be Claimed from the Insurance Company</h3>
<p>The Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) specially dispatched a CA-50 aircraft yesterday morning to Changxing to transport six bodies to Shanghai by air. The bodies had been placed in coffins by the Changxing County Government. According to the person in charge of the company, Flight 50 arrived at Longhua Airport at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, and the bodies were sent by car to the International Funeral Parlor to await the families of the deceased to claim and bury them, and in accordance with regulations, a consolation payment of one million yuan per person was issued to the deceased passengers. Regarding the drivers who died on duty, it was rumored that the company issued a consolation payment of US$10,000 per person, which was not true. However, it is known that all drivers usually have life insurance, and this driver will certainly not be an exception.</p>
<p>Regarding the 1.2 billion yuan of banknotes from the Bank of China, the bank had fully insured all of them with the China Insurance Company and the China Property Insurance Company before shipment. Due to the heavy responsibility, the above two insurance companies had also reinsured with a foreign insurance company in this city. Since the accident on flight 31, personnel from the Bank of China and the insurance company have rushed to Changxing one after another to negotiate with the county government and recover the banknotes and other matters related to the aftermath. According to a person in charge of CATC, after receiving a telegram from Assistant Manager Zhou Kechang the night before, the Bank of China authorities instructed to ask the Changxing County Government to cooperate with the local township ward chiefs to recover the banknotes from the villagers as much as possible. If this was not possible, the remaining 20 sacks of banknotes would be transported to Shanghai, and the rest would be compensated by the insurance company.</p>
<p>[Another News] According to the person in charge of the flight operations group of the Central Air Transport Corporation, there were six fatalities in this accident, and another one was an employee of the Central Corporation, named Hou Ande.</p>
<p>According to Assistant Manager Zhou Kechang, who returned to Shanghai from Changxing at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, of the 20 sacks of banknotes retained by the Changxing County Government, two sacks were found to be the driver's belongings, and one sack of banknotes was completely damaged and unusable. Therefore, only 17 sacks were actually complete and usable. These banknotes have been transported from Changxing to Huzhou, and the Huzhou branch of the Bank of China, together with the Commissioner's Office, the Changxing County Government, the court, and representatives of the Citizens Bank, are counting them. Two sacks have been counted yesterday, and the rest are still being counted. It is expected that it will be completed today, and the amount will be known tonight. It has not yet been decided whether to transport these banknotes to Shanghai again, and the decision will be made at the meeting convened by the bank today. As for the banknotes that were snatched by the mountain villagers, the personnel of the Changxing County Government and the township ward chiefs have been separately advising the villagers to return them.</p>
<h3>Director of the Territorial Affairs Department Comes to Shanghai to Investigate the Provincial and Municipal Boundary Issues</h3>
<p>The issue of provincial and municipal boundary demarcation has not yet been resolved. It is reported that Fu Jiaojin, Director of the Territorial Affairs Department of the Ministry of the Interior, arrived in Shanghai the night before last, and visited Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau yesterday to discuss the boundary demarcation issue. When the reporter visited Director Zhu to inquire about the boundary demarcation issue, he said that since the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality in 1927, the scope of the Songhu District has not been clearly defined. At that time, it was delineated by the Executive Yuan. After the victory, according to the original plan approved by the Executive Yuan, the Municipal Government should take over 13 rural districts, including Dachang and Yanghang. However, in reality, only a part of the administration of the two rural districts of Dachang and Yanghang has been taken over. In February of this year, the Municipal Government held a symposium, and the issue of provincial and municipal boundary demarcation was planned to be handled in accordance with the 1927 decision, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Executive Yuan previously ordered that the two rural districts of Dachang and Yanghang should still be划归宝山县. However, the residents of the two districts have expressed their disapproval and have requested the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Municipal Government to request that they still be划归上海市. When the reporter asked whether the boundary demarcation issue could be resolved by Director Fu's trip, Zhu said that Fu's trip was to investigate the actual situation on the ground, and then report back to the capital for instructions before making a decision.</p>
<h3>The Paper Mill Affiliated to the Resources Committee Sends a Letter to the Social Affairs Bureau to Prevent Labor Unrest; The Dispute at the Shenzhou Paper Mill is Resolved</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] After the victory, the Resources Committee took over the East and West factories of the Tianzhang Paper Mill, the Jinxing Paper Mill, and the Yingjing Paper Mill. After reorganization, they resumed work in October last year. Since the start of work, the factory's expenses have been huge, with monthly expenses for wages, electricity, etc. totaling 700 million yuan, and an additional 200 million yuan spent on equipment such as blankets and copper wire. In addition to all miscellaneous expenses, monthly expenses are no less than 1 billion yuan. Maintenance relies on self-borrowing and advance deposits. Regular income is often in the form of promissory notes with a payment period of half a month to a month, rather than cash. Recently, due to the union's request for year-end bonuses, which it was unable to bear, it feared that it would cause labor unrest and sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday yesterday to prevent it in advance.</p>

<h3>The Issue of the Venue for the Second General Assembly of the Municipal Council; Chairman Pan Telegraphed Secretary Xiang That Zhenshi Middle School is Still Appropriate</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The second general assembly of the Municipal Council has been decided to be held at Zhenshi Middle School on Anhe Temple Road on January 6th of next year. The Health Committee of the council believes that the location of Zhenshi Middle School is too remote and far from the city center, making it extremely inconvenient to travel back and forth. After discussion, it was decided to suggest that Chairman Pan change the venue and borrow the auditorium of Aurora University. The secretariat of the council believes that the borrowing of the Zhenshi Middle School venue has been agreed upon by both parties, and the road to the school will soon be repaired. If the venue needs to be changed, contact should be made urgently to avoid insufficient preparation as the assembly date approaches. Therefore, a telegram was sent to Nanjing to ask Chairman Pan for instructions.

<h3>Late Night Gunfire on Nanjing Road: Air Force Police and Soldiers Clash, Four Injured. Minor Incident Causes Trouble</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At approximately 10 PM last night, Wang Dezhu, the Second Section Chief of the Changning Road Police Precinct, was passing the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guangxi Road when he saw two men in plainclothes arguing at the telegraph station. He stepped forward to mediate, but one of them grabbed him, accusing him of interfering. He then called over eighty soldiers from the First Battalion, 101st Squadron, and 103rd Squadron of the Air Transport General Team stationed on military trucks on Lloyd Road, intending to drag Wang onto a truck. Wang, sensing danger, shouted for help. When Police Officer No. 2555 arrived, Wang seized the opportunity to escape and telegraphed the Old Zha District Precinct. Chief Shi, after receiving the report, dispatched over ten officers. However, the Air Transport General Team soldiers believed the police were deliberately making things difficult for them. They dragged Police Officer No. 2555 onto a truck and drove away, while another group of soldiers stood ready for battle. Both sides clashed. In self-defense, the police officers fired several shots, injuring Liu Mingzhao (20 years old, from Hunan), a soldier from the 103rd Squadron of the Air Force, in the left foot. Mechanics Yu Alin and Guan Tianxi were also injured. Police Officer No. 3314 from the Old Zha District Precinct was also beaten during the chaos.

<h3>Waning Year: Under the Eaves of Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] As the year wanes and industries decline, the increase in unemployment due to the poor economy has also led to a rise in cases of theft and suicide. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the military and police have been implementing winter security measures since last month to strengthen public order. There were 192 labor disputes in November, and in recent days, disputes over year-end bonuses have become even more frequent. This annual accounting period is a real challenge for China's precarious industrial and commercial sectors today. Cold waves have repeatedly hit Shanghai. Hopefully, they won't bring "bankruptcy winds" with them!</p>
<p>One-Third of Shanghai's Four Million People Unemployed</p>
<p>Despite Shanghai having many high-rise buildings, dignitaries, lavishly decorated company windows, and new cars shuttling through the streets like shuttles, this beautiful outer appearance cannot hide its internal crisis. Today, with a population of 3.96 million, Shanghai is estimated to have 1.353 million unemployed people, accounting for one-third of the total. This alarming figure is the result of today's poor economic situation.</p>
<p>Where can these unemployed people go? A serious problem that threatens social stability is before us. We talk about relief and placement, but in today's state, where can so many be accommodated?</p>
<p>Alarming Figures for Theft and Suicide</p>
<p>Let us also look at the figures for theft and suicide cases in the city: According to statistics, a total of 924 suicide cases occurred from January to November this year. The most common causes of suicide are financial difficulties and family disputes. November, with 85 cases, exceeded the average for each month. As for theft cases in October, 854 were reported, and 63 robberies occurred. The statistics for November have not yet been released by the police, so we don't know. But presumably, it won't be much different from October.</p>
<p>The Other Side of Society: Brothels and Dance Halls</p>
<p>Let's look at another statistic: As of the end of November, there were 853 registered brothels in the city, with a total of 2,337 prostitutes. There were 27 registered dance halls, with a total of 1,835 dancers. Most of them are between the ages of sixteen and twenty-five (this is the registered number; how many are unregistered?). People, who wouldn't want to live happily in the world? This group of people who engage in theft, sell their bodies and smiles, and even destroy their own lives, cannot be said to be 100% forced by life to do so, but the fact remains that they do it in order to not "starve." Doesn't the "street vendor case" also contain serious economic problems?</p>
<p>The Pros and Cons of Sleeping Pills</p>
<p>Many people commit suicide by using sleeping pills. The police department has specifically sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau, ordering the Shanghai New Medicine Merchants Association to inform all pharmacies that people who come to purchase sleeping pills must have a formal prescription from a doctor, and pharmacies can only fill the prescription once, stamp it, and not refill it. This measure is intended to prevent problems in advance, but it is only a passive deterrent. The way to fundamentally cure the problem is to make society stable and enable people to live happily.</p>
<p>Surviving the End of the Year?</p>
<p>Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors after the victory have been struggling to survive due to shortages of raw materials, high costs, difficulties in exporting, imports of foreign goods, and high-interest loans. Although the government once relaxed the foreign exchange rate, it still cannot cure this serious illness. The rising prices since the victory have made it impossible for ordinary salaried people to make ends meet. The recent fluctuations in gold prices and US dollars will undoubtedly stimulate prices again. It's the end of the year, is there going to be a finale?</p>
<p>Today, how many people are worried about Shanghai's "collapse" and the collapse of China's entire economy? In the long winter nights, it seems optimistic and confident to those who think "winter is here, can spring be far behind?" But reality is reality, the end of the year is just around the corner, and we only hope that Shanghai will not have more trouble!</p>
<h3>How Were the Top Ten News Stories Selected? A Preliminary Decision Was Made, Then the Order Was Evaluated by Each Newspaper. Only 30 Hours from Initiation to Completion</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] This newspaper's selection of the top ten domestic and local news stories of 1946, organized by this newspaper, was published in this newspaper yesterday. How were these top ten news stories selected? Perhaps we should give a report.</p>
<p>In advance, we carefully considered and "preliminarily selected" a dozen or so "major news stories." The criteria for selection were roughly based on these standards: (1) Was it sensational when it happened? (2) The importance of the event itself. (3) Whether the involvement and impact are widespread. After the "preliminary selection" was decided, we asked the chief editors, domestic news editors, local news editors, and interviewing directors of major newspapers in the city to evaluate the order. They ranked the "preliminarily selected" news items on the printed list according to their importance, from one to ten. We then calculated the scores according to this order: the first major news story received ten points, the second received nine points, and so on. Then we "counted the votes," and the one with the most points was the first major news story.</p>
<p>Among the thirty-three votes participating in the selection of domestic news, nineteen votes recognized that "The Political Consultative Conference Signing" was the biggest event of the year, resulting in 257 points, accounting for the absolute majority in first place. The second, "The National Government Returns to the Capital," had six votes recognizing it as the first major event, and the score difference was quite large. The third major event, "Peace Talks," had a score very close to the second place. Two votes recognized it as the first major event, but eleven votes recognized it as the second major event of the year. The scores for the fourth "Opening of Foreign Exchange," the fifth "Recapture of Zhangjiakou," and the sixth "The National Assembly was suddenly postponed for three days when it was about to open" were very close, with only about ten points difference. The seventh was "Chairman Chiang's Sixtieth Birthday," the eighth was "Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo Were Assassinated," and the ninth was "Import and Export Permit System." It is truly a matter of opinion; some people thought it was the first major event, while others did not consider it among the top ten news stories at all. The Chen Gongbo case was tenth - perhaps some people want to ask if there is a "candidate"? Then the first candidate was "Changchun Besieged for Thirty-Nine Days," and the second was "General Dai Li's Plane Crashes."</p>
<p>Among the thirty-two votes for the selection of local news stories, twenty votes recognized that the street vendor dispute was the biggest event of the year, which can be said to be unanimously recognized. The second event, the arsenal explosion, was also very interesting, with eleven votes recognizing it as the second major event of the year. The third event, Rong Desheng's kidnapping, had only a few points difference from the second place, with four gentlemen nominating it as the first major event of the year. The fourth was the grain loan case, the fifth was the Jiang Gongmei case, the sixth was the Yu Xiangyan case, and the seventh was the Zang Daerzi case. All four were "cases," and three of them have not yet been concluded. The eighth was the City Council election, and the ninth was the gold brick case, with close votes. The tenth place, "Miss Shanghai Election," was also very interesting, with four votes recognizing it as the tenth major news story, while one humorous gentleman said that it was the first major event in Shanghai this year!</p>
<p>This time, the top ten news story competition, from launching the plan, soliciting evaluations, organizing, to publishing in the morning newspaper, took only thirty hours in total. Because the time was relatively tight, omissions were inevitable. Thank you to all the gentlemen from various newspapers for their enthusiastic participation. We would like to express our utmost gratitude here!</p>

<h3>Bank Manager's Car Used for Drug Trafficking: Police Officers Go Undercover to Crack the Case. The Portuguese Mastermind Is on the Run</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, the Detective Section of the Police Department cracked a case of opium trafficking at the intersection of Xizang Road and Shantou Road. Two suspects were arrested on the spot, and four pieces of opium, weighing fifty taels, were seized. He Zhisheng, the manager of the Yadong Commercial Bank at 250 Nanjing Road, also provided his own car, license plate number 16756, to transport the drugs. After being taken to the police station for questioning, the suspects confessed that the mastermind was a Portuguese man named Zhamu. However, when the police went to arrest him, he had already fled upon hearing the news. It turned out that Cai Ruisheng, a 30-year-old man from Pudong, residing at No. 5 Ruitai Lane, North Suzhou Road, met Zhamu, a friend, at the Mals Cafe on Nanjing Road a month ago. Zhamu told him that he had a lot of opium and asked him to find a way to sell it, promising a generous reward. Later, Cai met Zhang Shude (29 years old, residing at No. 160 Taixing Lane, Xinkai River), a fellow townsman, on the road, and told him about Zhamu's intentions, asking him to pay attention. Zhang, tempted by the high profits, opened room 206 of the Longgong Hotel in the Eight Immortals Bridge area as a liaison office. Eventually, the matter was discovered by the police due to insufficient secrecy. On the afternoon of the 13th, the police department sent Section Chief Zhang Jinsheng and employee Chen Xianrong undercover, pretending to buy fifty taels of opium and showing gold bars as proof of their credit. Zhang, seeing that a large buyer had arrived, immediately telegraphed Cai Ruisheng. Cai arranged to meet the next afternoon at the intersection of Xizang Road and Shantou Road to exchange the goods for payment. When the time came, Cai went to the Mals Cafe to get fifty taels of opium from Zhamu, and then went to his relative, He Zhisheng, the manager of the Yadong Bank, to borrow a car, driven by the chauffeur Zhou Fengsheng, and drove straight to Shantou Road. The police officers had already been waiting at Zhang Shude's place, and when they saw Cai get out of the car, they arrested him and Zhang together while they were exchanging the goods. The car was also impounded. After being taken to the police station for questioning, Cai and Zhang confessed to drug trafficking. However, when He Zhisheng was summoned to the police station, he claimed that although Cai was his close relative, he was not aware of the drug trafficking and that he had not been asked for permission to borrow the car that day. After investigation by the police department, it was confirmed that this was the case, and the car and the chauffeur were released. The mastermind, Zhamu, had already fled upon hearing the news and is still being actively pursued. The case was completed yesterday and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>Small Office Workers Donate 630,000 Yuan to Sympathize with Fellow Citizens in Distress</h3>
<p>The city's Winter Relief Committee, in order to provide relief to refugees, has organized a fundraising committee to actively encourage the wealthy to donate, so as to save those in distress from starvation. They have successively held broadcast fundraising and district resident donation activities. Although the results are still satisfactory, there are still few wealthy merchants who are willing to donate automatically. Therefore, they plan to hold a dance party next spring. It is learned that the other day, a small office worker, sympathizing with fellow citizens in distress, donated all of his savings of 115,000 yuan from several months' salary. At the same time, he persuaded his friend to save the 515,000 yuan originally intended for his deceased father's birthday celebration and sent it to the committee along with a letter.</p>
<h3>Stolen Typewriter from the Tax Bureau: The Receiver of Stolen Goods is a Legitimate Businessman</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Two Endahua brand typewriters were stolen from the Jianghai Customs Office at 421 Changde Road in mid-October. The Jing'an Temple Precinct was notified after the incident. It was not until the other day that Second Section Officer Meng Duansheng and officers Yang Junqing, Wu Ming, and Lai Zhijiang investigated and arrested the thief Cao Weijiang in a shantytown at 238 Guihua Road. According to his confession, after stealing the two typewriters, he sold one to Le Jinquan at 240 Hongjiang Branch Road, who resold it to Xie Shengong (who is the director of the typewriter department) of the Keyi Company on Nanjing East Road for 450,000 yuan. He sold the other one to the Dakang Hardware Store at 394 Beijing East Road, who bought it for 400,000 yuan. After summoning the receivers of stolen goods to the police station for questioning, considering that they were all legitimate businessmen, they were released on bail. Cao and the case file were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for review.</p>
<h3>Accident Involving Health Bureau Car: Cart Driver Run Over and Killed on Carter Road. Police Officer Injured Jumping off Car in Pursuit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At around 9 PM the other night, a rickshaw puller was passing the entrance of Sanwei Yi Village on Carter Road near Avenue Road when a black truck with license plate number 31788 sped past and ran over the rickshaw puller's head, causing brain matter to splatter and instant death. The truck driver, seeing the serious accident he had caused, stepped on the accelerator and tried to escape. At that time, traffic police officer Xing Weiguang was stationed in the police booth of the newly established precinct. Witnessing the scene, he rushed out of the police booth. Unable to catch up, he took another truck and chased after the hit and run truck to Gordon Road. The two trucks were only a few steps away, and the police officer shouted for the driver of the hit and run truck to stop. But before the vehicle had come to a complete stop, the police officer jumped out of the vehicle, causing him to fall and injure his head. The driver of the hit and run truck took the opportunity to abandon the truck and flee. Other police officers then drove the truck back to the new precinct. By the next morning, it was found that the truck belonged to the city's Health Bureau and was used to transport bureau members. It was temporarily borrowed from the Aftermath Relief Administration. As for the hit and run truck driver, it was learned that his name was Zhang Yulin, and he lived at 3367 Nanyinghua Lane, Changshou Road. He was eventually arrested by Police Officer Wei Qihu No. 1484 and brought to the police station for investigation.</p>

<h3>The First Public Trial of the Grain Loan Embezzlement Case: One of the Eight Defendants is Absent. Wang Daren and Others Request Bail, Rejected in Court. Ren Xingya Pays Additional 5 Million Yuan in Cash Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The sensational nationwide grain loan embezzlement case, since the District Court Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution on the 23rd of last month, was first publicly tried in the Criminal Division II Court of the District Court at 9 AM yesterday, with Court President Wu Xiangzu serving as the presiding judge, and Wu Rongcai and Huang Guang serving as associate judges. At the time, the defendants in custody in the case, Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, and Wang Daren, had already been brought from the detention center. At the same time, the defendants who were out on bail, Xing Zhigang, Yang Runshe, and Ren Xingya, also arrived in court on time. Only Wan Molin was absent. The audience was full before 9 AM, but the order was well maintained. There were twelve lawyers, including Yu Zhongluo (selected by Wang Xunzhi and Zhuang Manzhang), Wu Zhengzhu (selected by Wu Rongsheng), Yu Zhongluo (selected by Wan Molin), Gu Weixiong and Wei Xuezhang (selected by Xing Zhigang), Zhong Juexian and Zhang Guangzong (selected by Yang Runshe), Wang Shanxiang and Miao Qingbang (selected by Wang Daren), and Lu Shaozong (selected by Ren Xingya). Lawyer Duanmu Kai was absent because he was attending the National Assembly in Beijing. The trial began at 9 AM and ended at 12:30 PM, lasting three and a half hours. The eighth defendant, Ren Xingya, paid an additional 5 million yuan in cash bail. The sixth defendant, Yang Runshe, was also allowed to pay 5 million yuan in cash bail. The fifth defendant, Xing Zhigang, was allowed to maintain the original bail. The remaining defendants were returned to custody for another hearing. The presiding judge first summoned seven defendants and asked the lawyers seated and questioned them one by one on their names, ages, and birthplaces. The lawyer of Wan Molin stood up and presented a letter from the defendant in Nanjing, and answered the court, saying that the defendant originally intended to appear in court, but now that the National Assembly was convened, he could not come to Shanghai. The court ruled that he must be present at the next hearing, otherwise a warrant would be issued.</p>
<h3>Prosecutor's Statement of Charges Against Eight Defendants</h3>
<p>Before the trial, Prosecutor Wu stood and stated the charges against each defendant, roughly as follows: Defendant 1, Wang Xunzhi, used the name of Housheng Company to borrow 150 million yuan of grain loans from Zhejiang Province. He then borrowed 60 million yuan in this city under the name of Changjiang Company, violating grain loan regulations and engaging in speculative manipulation. Defendant 2, Zhuang Hanzhang, as the business director of Changjiang Company, was responsible for purchasing and selling grain. He hoarded the rice purchased with the grain loan together with Wang Xunzhi and did not sell it immediately. Defendant 3, Wu Rongsheng, sold 1,193 bags out of the 11,000 bags of public rice entrusted to him by the government to stabilize grain prices to fellow traders, preventing it from stabilizing grain prices and creating suspicion of manipulation and monopoly. Defendant 4, Wan Molin, failed to declare 630 shi of grain and rice obtained through grain loans, creating suspicion of hoarding. Defendant 5, Xing Zhigang, used the name of Wan Changxin to obtain loans fraudulently. Defendant 6, Yang Runyu, transferred the loan of Wan Changxin to Xing Zhigang without approval from the relevant authorities. Defendants 7 and 8, Wang Daren and Ren Xingyai, as grain administration officials, allowed grain merchants to hoard and manipulate grain without intervention, disregarding the people's livelihood. This violated the original intention of the government's grain loan program. Although there is no evidence of a conspiracy to profit, there is suspicion of condoning the manipulation and hoarding of grain by grain merchants. Therefore, all are being prosecuted under Article 31 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce. The court is requested to impose strict penalties according to the law. After Prosecutor Wu finished his statement, he began individual questioning in order.</p>
<p>Wang Xunzhi</p>
<p>First, defendant Wang Xunzhi, deputy general manager of Changjiang Company, was questioned. Wang was wearing a blue coarse cloth robe, cloth shoes, and glasses. Wang stated that he had handled a total of 151 bags of grain and rice, which arrived in Shanghai around April 26th or 27th. At that time, the market was in turmoil, and he was ordered to delay sales. There was no intention to hoard. The second batch of 1,150 shi was brown rice and needed to be processed, so it could not be sold immediately. He also stated that Changjiang Company only borrowed 60 million yuan but handled 100 million yuan worth of rice. All the rice was sold immediately and not hoarded for profit. The Grain Loan Review Committee stipulated that grain merchants must return any special profits to the national treasury. He personally had no profit, so the accusation of manipulation and hoarding was based on a misunderstanding of the truth.</p>
<p>Zhuang Hanzhang</p>
<p>Defendant 2, Zhuang Hanzhang, business director of Changjiang Company, claimed to be just a minor employee. He knew very little about the points inquired by the court. He said that everything had to be done on the manager's order and that he had no right to advise on whether to sell the purchased grain.</p>
<p>Wu Rongsheng</p>
<p>Defendant 3, Wu Rongsheng, manager of Santai Grain and Miscellaneous Goods Store, stated that Santai was established seven or eight years before the war and reopened this year. He was responsible for the affairs of the guild and sometimes his employee Gao Qingkui handled some too. After obtaining the loan on April 21st, he purchased more than 3,500 shi of grain and rice and sold them continuously. On April 27th, he was entrusted by the Grain Administration to sell 30,000 dan of public rice. He was ordered to sell 5,000 bags within ten days, but he only sold 4,530 bags and then stopped. Everything was done on orders.</p>

<p>Defendant 4, Xing Zhigang, manager of Chengfeng Rice Store, claimed to have handled 100,000 large bags of military grain on consignment, but only 3,000 bags were completed. He served as a standing director of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association. When applying for a loan, because the quota was full, Wan Molin agreed to let him handle the loan under the name of Wan Changxin. He handled a total of 40 million yuan, 20 million yuan of which Wan Changxin used himself. He knew nothing else. He also did not report the matter to the Grain Administration.</p>
<p>Yang Runyu</p>
<p>Defendant 5, Yang Runyu, manager of Wan Changxin, was responsible for store affairs. Wan Molin notified him that the grain loan was received, so Xing Zhigang took all of it. He did not know how the profits were distributed.</p>
<p>Wang Daren Describes Grain Loan Process</p>
<p>At 11:01 AM, Wang Daren was questioned. He was the specialist commissioner of the Ministry of Food and acting director of the Shanghai Grain Administration. The court first ordered him to talk about the grain loan process. Wang stated that the proposal was made in October last year during Mayor Qian's tenure. Because the grain industry in Shanghai had been almost completely destroyed during the war, the purpose of the grain loan was to help restore the grain industry to protect the people's food supply. On April 1st, Premier Song came to Shanghai and convened a food conference. Xu Jiying, president of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and others proposed grain loans. Eight grain stores were proposed and selected for a conversation the next day about their capital and grain management experience. Chengfeng was proposed by the Chamber of Commerce, but it failed the review. Later, Wan Molin suggested that eight stores were too few, and it was decided that he would recommend nine more. These nine stores were later discussed under the chairmanship of Minister Xu. Although Chengfeng was included again, it was still eliminated. A total of sixteen stores were approved. On April 4th, the first review panel was convened, deciding that the total amount of loans would be 1 billion yuan. They drafted the loan regulations. At the time, to encourage competition, the loans were not limited to rice merchants and depended on their ability to purchase grain. Tongyi and Jiangbei companies were introduced by Li Chongnian. Although they were not rice merchants, they had the ability to purchase grain, so the trial was approved. The court inquired about the market dispute on April 27th. Wang replied that on that day, Tongyi sold 50 shi of rice at a price of 31,000 yuan per shi. The market price was more than 40,000 yuan, so rice stores scrambled to buy it, causing a dispute. After the dispute, the market was in chaos, so he reported to Minister Xu and requested Premier Song to decide to suspend the sale of grain loan rice in order to restore the normal transaction of the market. The court further inquired that the Soybean and Rice Industry Association submitted an application for loans from 52 rice stores on April 17th. Wang replied that it was true, but he received the application late, after May 20th, at which time the government no longer intended to provide grain loans. The court further inquired whether there was documentary evidence, such as a signed report, showing that the suspension of the sale of grain loan rice was ordered. Wang replied that the draft of the announcement was in Minister Xu's handwriting. He also said that the grain loan did not charge any fees other than the official interest of 3%. If any are discovered, they can be strictly prosecuted.</p>
<p>Ren Xingyai</p>
<p>Finally, Ren Xingyai was questioned. He stated that he was the chief of the Regulation Section, responsible for investigating grain prices and registering grain merchants. After the grain loan was issued, he was also responsible for verifying sales. He stated that the market dispute on April 27th was as Wang Daren described. He also stated that he resigned due to illness after May 8th. On May 25th, he was summoned to Nanjing to report the grain loan situation to Minister Xu. He knew nothing else. After all the defendants were questioned, lawyer Yu Ting stood up and requested that defendant Wang Xunzhi be granted bail, stating that Wang had a severe lung disease. He then stated that Zhuang Hanzhang had sores and also requested bail. Lawyer Wu Zheng also requested bail for defendant Wu Rongsheng, stating that since Wu was arrested, his family had been scattered, which was very tragic. Lawyer Yu Qingbang also requested bail for defendant Wang Daren, because the defendant who was prosecuted under the same clause had been granted bail and should enjoy the same treatment. After listening, the judge stood and declared that the requests for bail for Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, and Wang Daren should be rejected. Ren Xingyai was granted bail of 5 million yuan in cash. Yang Runyu was granted bail of 5 million yuan in cash. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Hai Xue Testifies in the O'Hara Espionage Case Denies Providing Information and Betraying Assistant</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Hai Xue, a henchman of the O'Hara Bureau's Peiping branch, testified yesterday in the O'Hara Bureau espionage case. Hai Xue is an Austrian Nazi and a member of the S.S. (Hitler's bodyguard). He admitted in court yesterday that he did not order his assistant to stop working after Germany surrendered. However, he believed that his superior, Volker, had given such instructions.</p>
<p>Hai Xue denied that he provided the Japanese with intelligence about the lack of Soviet troop deployments on the Manchurian border after Germany surrendered and before going to Beidaihe. He also denied selling his assistant, Maustok, to the Japanese as alleged, so that he could embezzle property with his superior and go to Beidaihe. He also denied his assistant's testimony in court the other day that he continued to work in the radio station located at the Italian consulate after Germany surrendered.</p>
<p>Hidaka, the former head of the Japanese intelligence agency in Peiping, also testified yesterday that the intelligence he obtained after Germany surrendered was supplied by the O'Hara Bureau.</p>
<h3>Black Hat Jiang Shiyan Still Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Jiang Shiyan, the "Black Hat" gang leader of the puppet Central China Railway Company, who was accused of beating to death passenger Xu Peiwen, was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the puppet Shanghai Local Court. After the victory, the Higher Procuratorate appealed, accusing him of relying on enemy and puppet forces to injure a passenger, resulting in death. The High Court reviewed the case and rendered a final judgement on the 11th. Yesterday morning, the sentence was pronounced: Jiang Shiyan was sentenced to life imprisonment, deprived of his civil rights for life, and his property was confiscated according to law. Jiang, a short man, wore a dark blue cotton robe yesterday. His body trembled slightly after hearing the verdict.</p>
<h3>High Court Questions Three People Involved in the Ding Mocun Case Yesterday</h3>

In order to clarify the situation, the High Court in the capital sent a letter to the High Court in this city, requesting a nearby investigation. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court summoned witness Zheng Liangjun, whose sister had been engaged in underground work and was killed by Ding. Ye Jiqing, wife of the jailed Li Shiqun, and Pan Sansheng, a puppet secret service henchman, were also summoned.

<h3>Changsha and Other Three Cities' Book Industry Responds to Request for Exemption from Business Tax</h3>

<h3>Kerosene Sales Have Not Stopped, Prices Have Not Changed</h3>
<p>Interview with the Person in Charge of Mobil Oil</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Amidst the rumors of rising kerosene prices, a reporter visited Mobil Oil, one of the three major kerosene importers in Shanghai, yesterday to inquire about the company's recent kerosene sales. According to the person in charge, there are 25 retail dealers in the city that distribute kerosene from Mobil Oil. The company distributes five large barrels of kerosene, each containing 53 gallons, to each retailer every day. The price per gallon is still 1,500 yuan. This sales situation has not changed or been interrupted. Therefore, the recent rise in kerosene prices is likely due to a sudden increase in demand from users.</p>

After the term expires, a 30-day grace period will still be allowed, for a total of six months. It is said that the matter has been submitted for approval and will be implemented once approved.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Malicious Abandonment</p>
<p>Question from Tai Rong in Nantong: A friend, Mr. A, married Miss B, and their relationship was poor and they often quarreled. At the beginning of this year, Mr. A secretly left while Miss B was returning to her parents' home, and there has been no news of him since. Since then, B's in-laws have treated her coldly, seeing her as a thorn in their side. Later, through mediation by relatives, A's parents acted as agents and signed an agreement with B to terminate the marital relationship, allowing her to remarry as she pleased, with a lawyer's certification. Now there are several legal questions, please answer them. (1) Is the divorce agreement signed by B and A's parents legally valid? (2) B published a notice urging A to return within a time limit, but A ignored it. Is it legal for B to remarry due to livelihood reasons? (3) Do A's parents have the legal right to handle the divorce procedures for their son? (4) How many years after A's disappearance can B remarry?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin Answers] (1) The agreement signed by A's parents and B is not legally valid. (2) A has been gone for more than a year, with no news and disregarding B's livelihood. A has maliciously abandoned his wife, and the situation is ongoing. According to Article 1052, Paragraph 5 of the Civil Code, this constitutes grounds for divorce. After publishing a notice and A failing to return within the time limit, B should request a divorce from the court. She can remarry only after the judgment allows the divorce. (3) Divorce must be done voluntarily by both the man and woman; others cannot act as agents. (4) If someone's life or death is unknown for more than three years, it constitutes grounds for divorce, but this provision does not apply to this case because A's malicious abandonment has specific time requirements.</p>
<p>(2) Fickleness</p>
<p>Question from Yu Lao: There is a woman, Miss A, who married a man surnamed Fang. Later, she became restless and cohabited with Mr. B. B is also married and has an evil nature. After the two cohabited, Miss A was often treated poorly. Now Miss A regrets it and wants to end her cohabitation with Mr. B. Please advise (1) how should she end it? (2) Can Miss A demand alimony from Mr. B? (3) If Miss A leaves B for C, does Mr. B have the right to interfere? (4) If Mr. Fang is dead, can his parents sue Mr. B? (5) Is it illegal for Mr. C and Miss A to cohabit?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin Answers] (1) Because A is not B's wife and has been abused, A is free to end the cohabitation. (2) If A cohabits with C after ending her cohabitation, she cannot demand alimony from B. (3) Because there was no formal marriage, they cannot become husband and wife. B has no legal right to interfere with A leaving B for C. (4) No. (5) If C already has a wife and does not have his wife's consent, his wife can sue A and C for interfering with the family.</p>

<p>The price of bullion continued its upward trend yesterday, and the Central Bank still found it difficult to cope. The opening price was 3.38 million, but it was sold off by those who had made profits, so it declined. Soon after opening, it fell to 3.33 million, then rebounded to 3.365 million. Therefore, the Central Bank doubled its pressure, gradually reducing it to around 3.31 million, and then it hovered. After ten o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 100 bars at a price of 3.335 million. After that, buyers became active again, and the supply became stagnant. The market price rose immediately. Speculative funds from the securities market came to support it, and the rising wind rose again. The high price was back to 3.44 million. After that, the demand and supply turned into a wrestling match, and the Central Bank also controlled it, once back down to 3.35 million. It was stable near noon. In the afternoon, people were slightly hesitant, and some even cut the line. Therefore, next-day delivery did not have much effect, but it saw a small setback. The final price was 3.34 million, and the result fell 35,000 compared with the previous recovery. Gold decorations were listed at 35,200, silver dollars rose slightly, and bank loans were still flat.

<h3>Tea Prices in Australia to Skyrocket</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Sydney, 16th] According to local importers and wholesalers, unless the Federal Government increases tea subsidies, Australian tea prices will skyrocket by the end of this year. Public tea auctions will begin at the end of the year. Merchants are comparing the reopening of tea auctions to wool auctions, saying that tea will also experience an unprecedented surge, jumping from a high of 30 pence to over 60 pence. To avoid this price leap, the government must increase subsidies to around three to four pence per pound. The manager of a major tea company in Sydney said that due to the continued suspension of tea production in Java, there is a shortage of tea worldwide. The Australian government has previously obtained sufficient tea to maintain the rationing system. During the period of the rationing system, the government must continue to purchase domestic tea and sell it to wholesalers. The manager also said, "After the resumption of auctions, no one knows how high world tea prices will rise." Tea prices will undoubtedly increase significantly. To maintain the current retail price of two shillings and three pence per pound, subsidies must be greatly increased. "The local tea price in Singapore is already higher than in Australia."</p>
<h3>Filament Rayon Prices Increase Consistently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for rayon remained stable. Only a few boxes of No. 120 miscellaneous brands were traded.

No. 75 semi-matte was traded at 4.2 million yuan, while other brands lacked transactions. Factory managers were all of superior quality and held firm on prices. Yesterday, D-grade silk opened at 4.55 million yuan, a significant increase of about 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Although there were few transactions for remaining goods, asking prices were consistently raised. Silk fabrics also saw slight progress due to the high cost of raw materials. Quilt covers rose by 50,000 yuan, while Huajin crepe and feather yarn rose by 100 yuan. Hangzhou goods also increased by 200 yuan per tael.</p>
<h3>8,500 Tons of US Wheat to Arrive in Shanghai Next Week</h3>

According to sources from the Joint Treasury (Si Lian Fen Chu), the committee passed eight general rules for reviewing production enterprise loans at its second meeting. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The priority order for production enterprise loans shall be determined based on the urgency of needs and the speed of production in various industries, with special attention to the following items:</p>

<p>3.  The loan interest rate is set at 4% per month.</p>
<p>4.  Loan collateral shall primarily consist of raw materials and finished products, pledged at 70% of cost. If the cost exceeds the market price, the market price shall be used.

<p>5.  The loan term shall be individually determined based on the needs and turnover time of each industry, with a limit of six months.</p>
<p>6.  The loan method shall be individually determined according to the following regulations:</p>
<p>(1) For production enterprises purchasing raw materials from other locations or transporting products for sale to other locations, loan assistance shall be provided through documentary bills.</p>

<p>(3) For production enterprises that need funds to prepare for the export of products overseas, loan assistance shall be provided through packing loans.</p>
<p>7.  Other review standards shall be handled in accordance with the precedents of the Joint Treasury. Detailed review rules may be formulated separately when necessary.</p>
<p>8.  These general rules shall be implemented after being approved by the committee and reported to the Joint Treasury for record-keeping.</p>
<h3>Trust Investments Should Be Subject to Reserve Requirements</h3>
<p>The Business Bureau of the Central Bank recently received a letter from the Ministry of Finance, stating that China Trust Company requested to inquire whether trust investments handled by trust companies should be subject to deposit reserve requirements. The letter stated that if depositors do not specify the type of investment for trust investment funds, reserve requirements should be paid to prevent abuse. If the type of investment is specified, the depository bank or company should submit the agreed documents or a copy to the Ministry of Finance for approval on a case-by-case basis. It is understood that the Central Bank has issued a circular for implementation.</p>
<h3>Wool Import Restrictions Cause Severe Crisis in the Wool Textile Industry, Production Work Largely Suspended</h3>
<p>Currently, half of the wool textile industry in this city has suspended production, and three factories have already closed down. According to industry sources, the import of wool has been affected by the foreign exchange adjustment because most raw materials come from abroad. Shandong wool, which is domestic, is more expensive than foreign wool due to transportation difficulties. It is predicted that a large number of manufacturers will close down by the end of the year.</p>
<h3>New Measures for Controlling Cotton Yarn to Be Discussed by the Textile Control Commission Today</h3>
<p>The new measures for controlling cotton yarn by the Textile Control Commission (Fang Guan Hui) are nearing a final decision. The commission will hold a meeting today at 3:00 PM to discuss them. It is reported that Premier Song, while in Shanghai, drafted a plan with Mayor Wu, Shu Yunzhang, and others. This plan will be discussed together with the plan proposed by the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association today. Therefore, today's meeting is particularly important. The Sixth District Association held a meeting of its standing directors yesterday afternoon to finalize the opinions put forward by private textile mills. After the meeting, Chairman Wang Qiyu submitted the proposed specific measures to Chairman Wu for review. It is understood that today's discussion by the Textile Control Commission will focus on the principles of the government supplying raw materials to private yarn mills and purchasing the cotton yarn they produce. Once the raw materials are confirmed, implementation measures will be drafted.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Cotton Textile Association Present the Opinions of Various Factories</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] After drafting eight points for a future cotton yarn handling plan, the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association submitted them to Chairman Wu of the Textile Control Commission (Fang Guan Hui) some days ago. Chairman Wu summoned Chairman Wang Qiyu of the association yesterday morning and gave him six points of a plan decided after Premier Song convened a meeting with relevant parties in Shanghai. Wang convened a meeting of the standing directors of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the six-point plan, gather opinions, and then appointed Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Xiao Yixin, Guo Dihuo, and Liu Jingji as representatives to visit Chairman Wu at 5:30 PM to exchange views on these six points in a private capacity. It is understood that the three points that factories find most difficult are: (1) Factories that have applied to the government for foreign exchange to purchase cotton should have half of the cotton yarn spun from their current cotton inventory purchased by the government. (2) The purchase price, previously stipulated as production cost plus a legal profit of 15% and a reserve for business development of 10%, for a total profit margin of 25%, seems too high and should be reduced to 10% to 15%. (3) In the future, all yarn spun from cotton purchased with foreign exchange should be purchased by the government. The factories' opinion is that they hope for a slight relaxation of each point. They hope that the original total profit margin can be maintained. They hope that half of the yarn spun from cotton purchased with foreign exchange will be purchased by the government, and the other half can be freely traded by the factories to facilitate increased production efficiency. During yesterday's informal talks, both sides' opinions were very close, and concrete results are expected to be achieved at the Textile Control Commission's regular meeting this afternoon. However, according to Chairman Wu, the Textile Control Commission's resolution still needs to be submitted to Premier Song for approval before it can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Spot Shortage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Taiwan sugar rose again due to a shortage. The association's board quoted the spot price of medium-grade white sugar at 142,000 yuan, which then rose to 144,500 yuan. Warehouse warrants were at 138,000 yuan, up 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw brown sugar was at 124,500 yuan, and warehouse warrants were at 118,000 yuan. Guangzhou-produced Runde Qing saw a decrease of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan as a larger quantity arrived and was immediately unloaded. Superior-grade Zhuang was at 94,000 to 95,000 yuan, second-grade was at 89,000 yuan. Xinghua white was at 138,000 yuan, and second-grade was 4,000 yuan less. Xinghua red was at 124,000 yuan. A total of over 700 pieces were traded.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchants Call on the Government to Purchase Tea, Meeting Held Yesterday to Decide on Measures</h3>
<p>The China Tea Association, the Export Trade Association, tea shops, tea trading associations, and representatives of tea merchants from various provinces held a meeting yesterday, presided over by Shou Jingwei, at the China Tea Association to appeal to the government to purchase stored tea. Attendees exchanged opinions and decided on the following measures: (1) Request the government to allocate 70 billion yuan for tea purchase funds. (2) Designate appropriate tea purchasing institutions to oversee the purchase matters. (3) Hire tea experts to handle grading and valuation matters. It is also understood that the above groups have scheduled an emergency members' meeting at the New Life Club this Saturday (21st) at 2:00 PM to continue discussing the above cases and hope that the government will implement them as soon as possible to alleviate the difficulties of the tea industry.</p>
<h3>There is Renewed Interest in Pingshui Chen Zhu Tea Among Tea Merchants</h3>
<p>Domestic sales of red and green tea in this district's shops and various road merchants remain sluggish. In the foreign tea market, high-grade aged Keemun is still stable. Other varieties, such as Wenzhou New Zhenmei and higher-quality aged smoked Zhenmei, aged Zhenmei, and aged medium Keemun, are selling relatively well. The rest are mediocre. However, according to industry sources, Xiachang Tea Company has renewed interest in No. 1 aged Chen Zhu tea from Pingshui. In addition, Wang Yutai Tea Company is also interested in stir-fried green tea.</p>
<h3>Slight Changes in the Items Subject to Import Restrictions by the Export-Import Control Commission</h3>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Export-Import Control Commission (Shu Guan Hui), some of the materials previously designated as restricted imports have presented difficulties. After discussion by the commission, (1) aircraft parts and (2) radio parts in Category IV of restricted import goods have been reclassified into Category III (A) because China does not produce these items and must rely on imports. This will facilitate their import. For goods that do not require foreign exchange and goods that have already been imported, applications can be made directly to the Import Management Office of the Customs within certain regulations. At the same time, the Customs has issued separate regulations regarding the handling of goods on the way and goods that have arrived: (1) Goods that have been loaded onto ships or airplanes and are within 20 hours of arriving at their destination are considered to be "on the way." (2) Goods that have been loaded onto ships or airplanes, imported, and are being unloaded by barges or trucks are considered to have "arrived." It is also heard that the commission will have several important decisions to implement, and is currently studying them in detail, which will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Industry Group Meetings Discuss Import Restrictions, Pigment Merchants Raise Two Requests</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The import and export industry is scheduled to hold a hardware group meeting today. After the cotton group meeting concluded, a written opinion has been submitted to the Export-Import Control Commission (Shu Guan Hui), with suggestions on import quotas. The commission has requested the government to allow the import of raw cotton that shipped before August 24th. It is heard that the government has agreed to this in principle. At the same time, the import industry hopes that future foreign cotton orders will not be concentrated solely in the United States, neglecting other sources. Because ordering exclusively from one place can cause merchants there to raise prices speculatively, and this phenomenon has already been observed. Nearly forty group meetings of the import and export industry will be held sequentially according to importance. All meetings are expected to be completed in two weeks. The resulting conclusions and statistics will be provided to the government for reference. As for the quotas for various types of imports, the Export-Import Control Commission has not yet fully decided today. The import and export industry hopes that when making decisions, the commission will pay attention to actual needs, and in addition to the government's statistics, will also refer to the statistics already compiled by the import and export merchants' associations and the quantities needed by private and state-owned factories.</p>
<p>After consultation, pigment importers in this city have resolved to request two points from the Export-Import Control Commission (Shu Guan Hui): (1) Pigments are necessities for China's dyeing and weaving industry. Our country has no production, and foreign sources have also decreased because Germany is no longer a pigment-producing country, and British products are also scarce. Only the United States can still supply a considerable quantity, but the demand is very large. It is proposed that pigments be elevated to a first-class import item, on par with production tools. (2) Pigments ordered after November 17 should all be allowed to be imported. It is also learned that the prices of American pigments are fluctuating due to high demand. According to the speculation of local importers, an export permit system may be implemented in the future.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Bank of China and China Sericulture Company Sign Autumn Cocoon Reeling Loan Agreement</h3>
<p>For the autumn cocoons purchased by silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year, the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) and the China Sericulture Company (CSC) have agreed that the "1946 Autumn Cocoon Loan General Management Office," jointly established by the CSC and ABC, will handle the required reeling labor loans. The loan method will follow the processing of spring cocoon reeling loans. However, the spring cocoon loan amount was 900,000 yuan per dan of raw silk. The autumn cocoon reeling loan has been increased to 1,400,000 yuan. The CSC and ABC have signed an agreement with the following key points: (1) The total overdraft loan amount is limited to 3.8 billion yuan. After signing the contract, the ABC will "open a 1946 Autumn Cocoon Reeling Loan Account for the CSC" and use the funds within the limit with checks. (2) The overdraft funds shall be used exclusively for relending to various manufacturers for reeling qualified raw silk for export, and shall not be diverted for other purposes. (3) When the CSC relends the overdraft funds to various manufacturers, payment shall be made upon seeing the silk. The loan amount shall be 1,400,000 yuan per dan of silk with a 20-fen, 20-warp/weft density. (4) With the consent of the ABC, the collateral for the overdraft will be all the first-priority collateral (autumn cocoons) obtained under the 1946 autumn cocoon loan case by the ABC to various manufacturers, and the second collateral (factory equipment) held by the ABC, jointly provided by the Autumn Cocoon Loan General Management Office established by the CSC and the ABC, will also be provided as joint collateral for the overdraft principal and interest. The reeled raw silk will also be the joint collateral for the ABC, managed by the Autumn Cocoon Loan General Management Office, with personnel stationed in various factories for supervision. The ABC will also send personnel to conduct random checks at any time, and the CSC shall provide convenience. (5) The Autumn Cocoon Loan General Management Office will be responsible for supervising the factories to sell the raw silk produced from the overdraft collateral at any time, and the proceeds shall be used to repay in the following order: First, repay the principal of the reeling labor overdraft; second, repay the principal of the ABC's cocoon loan; and third, repay the loan interest in proportion to the loan amount. (6) The term of the contract is from the date of signing to March 31, 1947, when the principal and interest will be fully repaid. (7) The interest rate is 2.5% per month. After deducting 0.5% for the management fee of the Loan Management Office, the remaining interest shall be settled monthly and paid in full upon expiration. (8) The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be responsible for guaranteeing the repayment of the principal and interest of the overdraft.</p>

In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the school was expanded into an industrial vocational school. When Zhejiang University was established, the school was reorganized into the College of Engineering. Over decades, he cultivated numerous talents. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Xu retired to the Shanghai concession, living a secluded life while remaining steadfastly loyal. His virtue was widely admired. Last spring, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek met with him in Shanghai and treated him with great respect. This month, the twenty-second day marks Mr. Xu's sixty-ninth birthday. Zhejiang University alumni from Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, in accordance with the principles of honoring teachers and respecting the elderly, will gather at Wangfo Temple on Binlang Road in this city to offer birthday congratulations and hold the resumption conference of the National Industrial Association. It is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Preparation for the Establishment of Xinsheng Primary School in the Fifteenth District of Zhabei</h3>
<p>The population of this city has surged, leading to overcrowding among school-age children. Public and private schools are insufficient to accommodate them, and countless children are out of school, especially in the Fifteenth District near the North Railway Station. Mr. Yu Bingwen, a local enthusiast for education, recognizing this problem, invited many like-minded individuals to organize a school board. They raised funds and secured three buildings at 101 Chongming Road as the school site. They plan to begin enrollment and classes next semester, naming the school Private Xinsheng Primary School. They have already submitted an application to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval to operate.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu, Representing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Welcomes Zhang Boling's Return to the Country; Nankai Alumni Schedule a Meeting and Banquet to Celebrate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University, returned to China aboard the "StagHound" from New York, arriving in Shanghai at 3:50 PM yesterday. The ship docked at the Kai Ping Wharf in Rihui Port. Among those who went to welcome him were Dong Shouyi, representing Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua; Cha Liangjian, President of the Local Court; Wang Yousheng, Director of the Relief Administration; Huang Yusheng, Secretary-General of Nankai University; He Lian, Director of the Institute of Economics; and Li Bojian, Chairman of the Nankai University Alumni Association, along with Tan Xifeng, Fang Xianting, and fifty to sixty others. Mayor Wu Guozhen also arrived promptly. Before the ship docked, he announced loudly to Zhang Boling: "Yesterday evening, after nine o'clock, the Chairman called me and asked me to represent him in welcoming you." Mayor Wu, being a Nankai alumnus himself, not only extended greetings on behalf of Chairman Chiang but also personally joined the welcoming party. Everyone sang the Nankai school song in unison and shouted slogans such as "Long live Nankai," "Long live President Zhang," and "Long live the Republic of China." Although Zhang Boling had a full head of white hair, he appeared remarkably energetic. As he descended the gangway, he declined the assistance of Nankai alumni, using a walking stick and repeatedly saying, "I'm alright, I'm alright."</p>
<p>Reason for Delayed Travel</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang departed for the United States on March 2nd of this year to undergo surgery for prostate enlargement. He had recovered quickly and was scheduled to return home in August, but he fell and injured his spine before boarding, delaying his travel. Subsequently, a strike by American sailors further prevented his departure. He finally set off from New York on the "StagHound" on November 15th, a journey that took a total of thirty-two days. It is understood that this was a cargo ship with only four or five passengers. Those returning to China with Zhang Boling included his eldest son, Zhang Xilu, and a nephew of Gan Junji, our envoy to Italy.</p>
<p>Nankai's Ten-Year Plan</p>
<p>Everyone is quite concerned about the future of Nankai. Mr. Zhang told reporters that he plans for Nankai to revert to private status in ten years. At the same time, Nankai Middle School in Chongqing will be expanded. It has also been decided to establish a Nankai Middle School in Shanghai and gradually expand to other cities. Regarding the situation and future of China, Mr. Zhang is full of optimism, saying, "Now is a golden opportunity. All our constraints have been lifted. The Japanese have surrendered, and the unequal treaties have been abolished. There are no enemies to the east, west, south, or north. China is going to grow! However, there will be difficulties, and everyone must work hard."</p>
<p>A Bright Future for China</p>
<p>After a short rest, Mr. Zhang added, "We have such a great leader, working hard for the country and for democracy. His health and spirit are so good. The future of the country is certainly bright. At the same time, we have the help of the most powerful country in the world, the United States, and the Soviet Union's attitude is also quite peaceful. As long as everyone acts with patriotism, China's peaceful reconstruction will certainly succeed!"</p>
<p>Scheduled Visits to Nanjing and Tianjin</p>
<p>Zhang Boling is currently residing in a warm and comfortable villa on Maiyang Road, prepared by Nankai alumni. It is also reported that the alumni plan to hold a welcoming banquet on Sunday. Mayor Wu is scheduled to host a dinner this Friday to welcome Mr. Zhang. Mr. Zhang is scheduled to travel to Nanjing next week to meet with the Chairman and to discuss important matters with relevant parties before proceeding to Tianjin.</p>

<h3>After the Victory, the First National Games Should Be Held in Changchun; Joint Conference of Party, Government, Military, and Organizations in Changchun Resolves to Request the Ministry of Education to Implement Its Previous Order</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Correspondent in Changchun, 17th] At today's joint conference of party, government, military, and organizations here, it was unanimously resolved to request the Ministry of Education to schedule the first post-victory National Games to be held in Changchun. It is generally believed that: (1) Before September 18th (the Mukden Incident), the government issued an order that the National Games be held in Northeast China. However, the subsequent invasion by the Japanese prevented its realization. Now that Northeast China has been liberated, the government should implement its previously announced order. (2) Everyone knows the importance of Northeast China, but people in the interior of China do not have a clear understanding of the true situation in the Northeast. As the saying goes, "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." All young people in the country should have the opportunity to understand our great Northeast. (3) Northeast China was occupied for fourteen years, longer than any other occupied area. The National Games should be held in Changchun to provide an opportunity for the Northeast to revitalize. (4) The sports field in the capital has been completely destroyed and is unusable. The cost of repair is estimated at 3 billion yuan. The government should save this money. The sports field in Changchun is still intact and can be used. Furthermore, the cost of concentrating athletes in the capital is no less than concentrating them in Changchun.</p>

<h3>A Major Explosion at the Municipal Stadium; Education Bureau Petitions the Municipal Government to Negotiate Compensation for Losses</h3>
<p>Requesting the Public Works Bureau to Estimate Repair Costs</p>
<p>The Municipal Central District Stadium was previously occupied by enemy forces. After liberation, it was still occupied by military agencies as an arsenal. Unfortunately, a major explosion occurred on the 7th of this month, destroying half of the stadium's structures and causing significant losses. Director Gu Yuxiu of the Municipal Education Bureau, to investigate the losses and petition for compensation, sent a letter to the Municipal Public Works Bureau, requesting that it send personnel to estimate the cost of repairs. The original text: "The Municipal Stadium in Jiangwan was built in the 23rd year of the Republic of China at a great expense and is the most complete sports facility in this city. Although it suffered minor damage during the war, most of it was intact and usable. It is currently used by the First Logistics District Headquarters of the United Logistics Command as the Second Arsenal, storing artillery shells and other military supplies. Unfortunately, a major explosion occurred on the 7th of this month, destroying more than half of the stadium's structures and causing significant losses. The stadium is an important educational facility in this city and was built with municipal bonds borne by the citizens, making it one of the city's most important municipal assets. Now that it has been destroyed, compensation should be sought. In addition to reporting the damage to the Municipal Government and requesting negotiations for compensation, we hereby request your bureau to send personnel to estimate the cost of repairing the stadium and to provide a response for use in petitioning for compensation. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau, Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, Li Ximou, Deputy Director, December 13, 35th year of the Republic of China."</p>

<h3>A Trip to Taitung: A Forgotten Virgin Land</h3>
<p>— Taipei Air Dispatch, 12th, Our Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>Taitung, also known as Eastern Taiwan, is a virgin land that has been almost forgotten. On the edge of the Pacific Ocean, high mountains and deep waters, wind and rain, nurture a rugged, desolate, and secluded wilderness. Not only are tourists reluctant to set foot there, but even those who grew up in the western plains regard this area with trepidation. Recently, the Governor-General's Office has shifted its vision and focused its attention on this area awaiting development. Eastern Taiwan, like China's Northwest, should no longer be forgotten. It is like a tumor on Taiwan, which must be operated on quickly. Precisely because of this, a public organization was formed to conduct investigations, using the findings as a basis for development. I, the reporter, have also become a member of the reclamation team, embarking on a journey with the group.</p>
<p>Developing Taitung: The Inspection Team as Vanguard</p>
<p>The Taitung Inspection Team includes fourteen units and twenty-four key personnel from relevant departments. This is the first planned organization in this province since the restoration. This organization will determine the fate of Eastern Taiwan and will be the vanguard of development, especially in terms of transportation. Almost all are mobilized, led by Director Ren Xianqun. The members include Hua Shousong, Director of the Highway Bureau; Xu Shangzhen, General Manager of the Transportation Company; Chen Qingwen, Chairman of the Railway Commission; Zhang Zhongsong, Factory Director; Xu Renshou, Director of the Keelung Port Bureau; Lin Zebin, Director of the Kaohsiung Port Bureau; Jin Deming, Feng Fazhu, Bao Guanfang, Directors of the Shipping Company; Tang Tongsun, Captain; Fei Hua, Director of the Public Works Bureau; Li Chunsong and Ye Mingsheng, Chief Engineers; Xu Eyun, Special Commissioner of the Industry and Mining Bureau; Li Jianren, Section Chief; Huo Bochang and Jin Teng of the Postal and Telecommunications Administration; Bi Qingchang, Director of the Geological Research Institute; Wang Renyu, Section Chief of the Meteorological Bureau; Mao Chuanpo of the Oceanographic Institute; Yuan Jidian, Section Chief of the Civil Affairs Department, and others. These members can be said to be the most comprehensive inspection team and the heads of the main departments urgently solving problems in Eastern Taiwan.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 5th, we boarded the night express train to Kaohsiung. The departure was uncertain until a few hours before, because the earthquake in Tainan had damaged the road surface and prevented passage. However, the repairs were quickly completed in three hours, and the train departed on time, allowing us to spend the night traversing the 510 kilometers of the western plains. On the morning of the 6th, we boarded a special military vehicle to Taitung, beginning a nearly 700-kilometer island-wide journey.</p>
<p>On the Southern Loop Line: Like a Spring Trip</p>
<p>On the Southern Loop Line, we made a large loop in the southern part of the island. Everyone prepared woolen clothing, fearing the cold nights of winter, but on the journey, everyone felt differently. The climate in southern China, at the southern tip of the island, is the opposite of the north in winter: dry, rainless, and dusty. The sun is still like a large umbrella, heating the hearts of travelers. It no longer makes people yearn for the north. We all felt that this was truly a spring trip.</p>
<p>The Southern Loop Line goes from Kaohsiung through Pingtung to Linbian, with provincial and county roads intersecting. At noon, we ate lunch at Fangliao Station and continued on, turning into Dawu in the east from Fenggang. This is purely a pebble road along the coast. The Japanese used to plant trees here, but the war forced them to cut them down for military use. From Dawu to Dama, it is purely an undeveloped wilderness: the mountains are covered with hardy plants, broadleaf and needle-shaped trees stretching their branches to welcome the wind, purple-crimson flowers interspersed with emerald green leaves, unpicked, wild smoke and desolate, a scene of desolation.</p>
<p>In Fenggang, Zhang Shaochu, director of the Seventh Engineering Office, led workers to welcome us. Director Fei was pleased to introduce to us that the roadbed from here to Taitung, seventeen kilometers long, had been washed away by typhoons last year, and fifteen bridges had been destroyed. Repairs began in March this year, mobilizing 150,000 workers and costing 22 million Taiwan dollars. The project was completed on August 25th. Director Zhang, at the southernmost end of the island, quickly completed the construction of the highway network. He now feels gratified to be able to ride in the newest Ford car on the pebble road he built, speeding like wind and lightning. This is the greatest reward for an engineering worker!</p>
<p>Seaside Night Talk: County Magistrate Praises the Gaoshan People</p>
<p>In a remote township called Dawu, the Taitung County Councilors traveled 66 kilometers from the county seat to greet us. The rugged mountain road lacking rest stops caused their cars to become separated from ours, and we did not see them until 9:00 PM. This enthusiastic welcome was truly touching.</p>
<p>The night in this small seaside town is not lonely tonight. The government's concern for Taitung made them welcome us warmly, waiting from the afternoon until dusk. We proceeded along the orderly welcoming lines, listening to County Magistrate Xie Zhen's report amid the sound of green firework crackers:</p>
<p>Of the 100,000 people in Huidong County, the Gaoshan people (Ami tribe) account for 44,000. There is an agricultural vocational school with 4,500 mu of experimental fields. Gaoshan students account for more than 90% of the student body, and the principal is also a Gaoshan agricultural researcher educated in Japan. County Magistrate Xie earnestly said that the Gaoshan people are not only not to be feared but are also the most lovable and promising people. They are the fastest to pay land taxes, and they also dominate in village appearance competitions, being clean and simple. Their performance in this year's provincial games was also the most outstanding. As Governor Chen said, the Japanese discovered the Gaoshan people's strengths too late. We are now trying to discover and understand them as much as possible.</p>
<p>The Bank of Taiwan has a branch here, with deposits reaching over 105 million, but loans are only over 4 million. In the past, it reached 8.5 million, but now it is clearly struggling to circulate. It is hoped that the liquidity will be eased. The Monopoly Bureau has a monthly income of 3.3 million and plans to enter 46% of the mountain areas, hoping to reach 5 million. The annual production of camphor is over 60,000 kilograms, and 750 mu are planted with tobacco. The county has an area of over 540,000 mu, of which more than 36,000 mu are forest land (arable land), which is currently barren. It may be possible to use it to plant pineapples, fiber crops such as ramie, and Sayi Chaila (transliteration). The latter is a broadleaf tropical crop, planted in the United States. 60,000 seedlings have already been planted and are used exclusively for making ropes. It is the most promising crop for promotion in the east.</p>
<p>The reporter is very concerned about the issue of the Gaoshan compatriots' centrifugal force. Not long ago, it was rumored in Taipei that it was causing trouble. According to Secretary Chen Hueling, it may have been caused by a misunderstanding arising from the need to cut one-third of the police force in line with the budget. Now there is something close to a cult that is gradually penetrating the mountains. According to other sources, in the past, the Japanese government, in order to protect the lives of the Gaoshan people, designated reserves for them to cultivate. After the restoration, the forestry authorities rented out some of the areas to merchants for business, causing them extreme dissatisfaction. Recently, this kind of situation, which almost caused major incidents, has occurred in Hsinchu and Tainan. The Governor has issued a notice to pay attention.</p>
<p>The Gaoshan people are excellent, but also the most innocent. They only have one belief: the government gives them comfort, and what the government promises to do must be fulfilled every time. If the government gives only empty promises once, even the achievements of the past will be lost. [End of Section 1]</p>
<h3>East Tai Outer Perimeter Fire Line</h3>
<p>— Caonian, 3rd [of month] Dispatch from Tai County Correspondent Ling Songshou of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Donghe City was recovered just over a month ago, and the people are already hearing the rumble of artillery again.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the recovery of Donghe was a severe blow to the Communist army, pushing its fate in northern Jiangsu towards a dead end. The reporter knew that the Communist army would not be reconciled, so he had been waiting in Dongtai for this drama to unfold.</p>
<p>Overture Begins</p>
<p>Sure enough, the overture to the drama has begun. The 83rd Division's staff office told the reporter that the Communist army has concentrated eighteen regiments of troops around Dongtai, claiming they will use all their strength to "recover" Dongtai.</p>
<p>"Mr. Reporter, you have another good article to write!" The fire in the stove illuminated the face of Division Commander Li Tianxia, who excitedly said, "If they don't attack me, I won't attack them. If they want to try something, hmph! Eighteen regiments, I want to see what they can do!"</p>
<p>On the evening of the 27th, the Communist army used its most elite force in northern Jiangsu—the 1st Regiment of the 31st Brigade (reorganized from the original 7th Column)—to launch a full-scale attack on Jiuli Pavilion, on the outskirts of Dongtai. But the National Army was well-prepared, and in a combined arms operation with infantry and artillery, the Communist army could not withstand the intense artillery fire for several hours and retreated to Dingxi Town (16 li from Dongtai), and the Touzong, Erzong, and Sanzong areas four li east of the town.</p>
<p>Who did they encounter from the National Army? It was the 19th Brigade, which defended Taixing and Xuanjiabao, and was the first to enter Dongtai. This was truly enemies meeting face to face. The brothers of the 56th and 57th Regiments were rubbing their fists and shouting, "Damn it! You've provoked the tiger. If we don't fight to Dingxi and Caonian, we're not worthy of being men."</p>
<p>The National Army continued its advance and began a counter-offensive. The forward outposts of both sides were in a standoff near Panjiashe (12 li from Dongtai).</p>
<p>The Communist army also knew that the situation was tense, so they gathered all three regiments of the 31st Brigade—the 91st, 92nd, and 93rd—in the Dingxi and Caonian area, preparing for a major battle.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the reporter accompanied Division Commander Li to the front line for inspection. Accompanying him were Chief of Staff Chang, Deputy Chief of Staff Cheng, and Dagongbao reporter Yan Qingshu—but he left Dongtai the next day for other tasks.</p>
<p>The sky was a dull gray. Although the drizzle wasn't heavy, the wind was strangely cold. It looked like it was going to snow. Two jeeps sped along the highway, and the jolting of the vehicles vibrated the heartstrings of everyone.</p>
<p>Upon reaching Sanli, the 19th Brigade's command post was set up here. Brigade Commander Yang also jumped into the vehicle to go to the front line.</p>
<p>Due to a phone call from the brigade command post, Regiment Commander Liu Guangyu knew that the division commander was coming to the front line. He stood by the highway waiting. The division commander got out of the car, and he immediately reported the situation at the front. Then he talked to the reporter: "Look, they're attacking again. I really don't understand what they're thinking, wanting to cause trouble for this land and the nation? The world needs peace, the country needs peace, and we need peace even more. Mr. Reporter, please think for us: We've suffered enough during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we've shown our strength enough. Do we still have to play this game among ourselves after victory today? However, they won't allow it. They want to attack you!" As he spoke, running, we arrived at the regimental command post. The command post was set up in a thatched shed. The light was very dim. While the generals were discussing strategy, Brother Qingshu and I went out for a walk.</p>
<p>This was a field. There were very few houses, and even the thatched sheds were sparse. The soldiers used grass stalks to build tent-like shelters as places to rest, scattered in groups across the positions.</p>
<p>You can only see everything about soldiers when you get to the battlefield. Among them, there were old men in their forties and fifties, and there were also children of fourteen or fifteen years old. They were all very innocent and lively. On a small mound, we saw a soldier carrying a piece of wood, probably for some construction work. As he walked, he spun the wood around his body, singing folk songs. Although the cold wind was blowing on him, the reporter believed that his heart was full and joyful.</p>
<p>They had very good habits of cleanliness. When they were fighting, the newly received cotton clothes were inevitably soiled, so they wore their clothes inside out, or put the summer clothes they wore on top. At first, the reporter thought it was another kind of uniform, or a kind of marking, but later, when I went to the front, I realized it was this. In fact, on the battlefield, even life cannot be guaranteed, let alone clothes? This alone is enough to show their innocence.</p>
<p>Injured with Brave Words</p>
<p>The reporter encountered a wounded soldier, who had just been carried from the front line to the rear. After he was set down, the reporter went up and asked, "What's wrong? Are you injured?" He pointed to a patch of crimson on his arm and said, "It's nothing, just a minor injury." The reporter said to him, "You are too tired." He raised his eyebrows and said very bravely, "If we don't sacrifice, then tens of thousands of our compatriots will have to suffer!" The reporter asked him again, "How is it on the front line?" He said, "Damn it! I aimed at these sons of bitches on the battlefield, one shot for each, and fired several shots in a row. After a while, we charged forward, and after less than a few dozen meters, I was injured..." The more he talked, the more excited he became, wanting to sit up. The reporter hurriedly pressed him down.</p>
<p>At dusk, the reporter left the front line with Division Commander Li. The sounds of gunfire and artillery were resonating densely. The clouds in the sky were even thicker, and the northwest wind was blowing from behind. The reporter shivered several times.</p>
<p>Overnight, the northwest wind blew down pure white snowflakes. On the afternoon of the 28th, the snow became even denser. The sounds of artillery fire were also directly proportional to the density of the snowflakes. The reporter knew in the divisional headquarters that the troops had advanced to the Panjiashe and Wujiaqiao lines in the face of bad weather, and the snowflakes were fluttering. "Like scattering salt, like drifting catkins, like the dancing of pear blossoms," Division Commander Li was concerned about the food and lodging of the soldiers on the front line, and frequently called the front to ask about it.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the weather turned clear. After lunch, the reporter accompanied the division commander in a speedboat to the front.</p>
<p>Harmony Without Distance</p>
<p>As soon as the reporter saw Artillery Battalion Commander Zhao Bingxing, he asked him: How was yesterday? He smiled and said, "We have plenty of hot blood, and the wind and snow can never diminish our fighting spirit." He also told the reporter, "The soldiers' morale is very high, and there is absolutely no sign of being afraid of the cold. Some soldiers even said to each other: 'We are considered good, the infantrymen in the front row have to hold their guns and charge forward!'" Battalion Commander Zhao pointed to his thatched shed and a radio and said, "The reason why we officers and soldiers can be harmonious and without any distance is that we absolutely share weal and woe with the soldiers. Look, this is my resting place, no different from the soldiers. Whenever we have free time, we immediately turn on the radio for everyone to listen to. But as soon as there is a firing order, everyone runs back to their original posts." Afterward, we logically talked about the Communist Party. Battalion Commander Zhao said, "Some people think that no matter whose reasons are right, it seems a bit too much for our own people to fight our own people. In fact, they don't know, who doesn't want peace? If there wasn't a war, would we come here to be attacked by the wind and snow? But, does the Communist Party treat us as Chinese people? To go a step further: Do they even treat themselves as Chinese people?"</p>
<p>We also arrived at the 56th Regiment's command post, which was no longer the same place as the day before.</p>
<p>I asked Regiment Commander Liu:</p>
<p>"How are you doing yesterday?"</p>
<p>He jokingly replied:</p>
<p>"I'm fine, it's just that I've drunk several buckets of ginger and brown sugar tea (the reporter's note: used to ward off the cold)."</p>
<p>The situation on the battlefield that day was like this——</p>
<p>The National Army has approached the front of Dingxi, Toude, Erzong, and Sanzong, facing off against the Communist army across the river. The Communist army, the 92nd Regiment is defending Caonian, the 93rd Regiment is defending Dingxi, and the 91st Regiment, the most elite of the 31st Brigade, is in the Tou, Er, and San Zong area.</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Liu Guangyu glared at the reporter and shouted, "Our highlight performance is here again, watch!"</p>
<p>On the morning of the 30th, the 56th Regiment used a company to cross the river in front of the enemy at Erzong, occupy a bridgehead, and cover the sappers in building a bridge. The Communist army was flustered, so other than leaving a small number of troops at Touzong and Sanzong, they concentrated all the main forces of the 91st Regiment to annihilate this company. They charged seven times in a row, but they couldn't withstand the concentrated artillery fire, and one by one they fell. The National Army crossed the river like a tide, and fifty-seven [unit] attacked [direction]. A part of the 56th Regiment turned to Dinghandong. At the same time, the main force of the 56th Regiment in front of Dingxi, under the cover of artillery and air force, cooperated with the naval forces and recovered Dingxi at 4:00 PM. Next, the 57th Regiment took an encirclement offensive against Caonian, and captured it at 4:40 AM the next day (December 1).</p>
<p>After the incident, according to investigations, in San[ ] alone, the Communist army left behind more than a thousand corpses. This was the end of the Communist army's elite troops attacking Dongtai.</p>
<p>"Strike the attackers with strikes!" After the recovery of Dongtai, the 19th Brigade gave the Communist army another serious lesson.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Wu Jingxiong</h3>
<p>— Chen Ruyi</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Jingxiong, our country's ambassador to the Holy See, left Shanghai on the "General Joffre" postal ship the other day and went to Marseille, transferring to his post to assume his new position. Dr. Wu was originally a legal scholar of our time, and his morality and writing are admired by the world; now I respectfully write several anecdotes about Mr. Wu's life and deeds to give to readers.</p>
<p>Obtained Doctorate at Twenty-Two</p>
<p>Wu was born in Yin County, Zhejiang Province in 189[?]. His father, Mr. Jiacuang, was a Confucian merchant and the first president of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce. Wu was taught by Mr. Jiacuang himself in his childhood. Later, he graduated from Hanxiang Primary School and Xiaoshi Middle School. In 1920, he graduated first in his class from Soochow Law School. He immediately went to America and, in 1921, obtained a doctorate in law from the University of Michigan, at the young age of twenty-two. His article, "A Study of Ancient Chinese Law and Jurisprudence," was very popular among readers there. Recommended by professors Dickinson Drake and Crane of the school, he was awarded the Carnegie International Peace Prize, which funded his advanced studies at the University of Paris. Because of his outstanding grades, he received the scholarship for another year and transferred to the University of Berlin, where he engaged in research under the guidance of the famous Professor Stammler. Wu also wrote an article, "Holmes's Philosophy of Law," which was published in the "Michigan Law Review." In 1923, he returned to study at Harvard Law School under Dean Pound. Wu then published an article, "Pound's Philosophy of Law," in the Illinois Law Review. Soon after, at the invitation of Dean Wigmore and Professor Kocourek of the Northwestern University School of Law, he wrote "Stammler and His Critics," which was included in the famous "Modern Legal Philosophy Series." Later, at the invitation of his alma mater, Soochow Law School, he returned to China to teach, studying international law, Roman law, and jurisprudence. Wu once served as a philosophy researcher at the Academia Sinica. His book, "The Human Element in Law," was included in the Harvard Law School Series.</p>
<p>Contributed Greatly to the Constitution</p>
<p>Wu was originally a giant in the legal field. In his early years, he lectured in the United States, [gaining] great fame. Since the establishment of the National Government, he has served as a member of the Legislative Yuan to this day, presiding over the Law Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, etc. He has contributed greatly to the creation of our country's code of laws and is highly regarded by President Sun Zhesheng of the Executive Yuan. The initial draft of the Constitution of the Republic of China was drafted by Wu. During the constitutional process, Wu participated in everything. Before and after the opening of the National Assembly, Wu participated in the final revision work to provide a basis for the conference's discussion. Everything he said was profound and to the point. This draft constitution incorporated opinions from all parties and naturally differed from the spirit of the "May 5th Draft" [Constitution]. On November 27, the Central Propaganda Department held a press conference. More than 200 foreign and domestic reporters attended. Wu attended to explain the origins of the constitution, tactfully and thoroughly, and the reporters were all convinced. Also, Wu went to the United States last summer to attend the San Francisco Conference as an advisor to our country's delegation. The Chinese version of the United Nations Charter was also drafted by Wu. The adoption of Chinese as an official language of the international community was actually due to this. The Charter is the fundamental law, and the peace and stability of the world are based on it. Wu's contribution can be said to be great.</p>
<p>Received Baptism to Avoid Banditry</p>
<p>Wu was a Protestant in his early years. In the fall of 1937, Shanghai fell, and Wu, who was an aide at the core of power and held an important position, was eagerly sought by the enemy puppets. At first, he took refuge in the home of his friend Yuan Jiahong. He happened to read the book "The Story of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux" and was deeply moved. A few hours before going to Hong Kong, he was baptized as a Catholic, which has been nine years ago. His faith and diligence in religious practice are often praised by people in the church.</p>
<p>One Hundred and Fifty Songs Without Falsehood</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, Wu translated the Bible under the order of President Chiang. The entire New Testament and the Psalms (formerly known as "Book of Odes") in the Old Testament have been completed. The initial draft of the translation of the Psalms, with a total of one hundred and fifty songs in five volumes, was translated into verse with elegant diction and resounding rhythm. President Chiang himself proofread them in his spare time, which is enough to see the value of this book. It was published by the Commercial Press in October. In two months, more than 10,000 copies were sold. Good reviews arose everywhere, and the world respected it. The author wrote an article, "The View of Life in the Psalms," to briefly express his views. What did Wu think of the Psalms? Wu once said to me: "The three hundred Songs can be summed up in one sentence: 'Without corrupt thoughts.' And the one hundred and fifty Psalms can be summed up in one sentence: 'Without falsehood.' The Psalms are words of supplication to God by prophets throughout the ages, and the words come from sincerity, truth, and honesty, which is a further step from the ancient Chinese poetry that expressed intentions."</p>
<p>Family Journey with Native Country in Mind</p>
<p>In 19[??], Wu returned home at the young age of eighteen, and his relationship with [wife] was intimate and lasted for a long time. Wu's studies and politics were without domestic worries, which was due to the efforts of his wife. Wu currently has nine sons and four daughters, with an age gap of only one or two years between them. Those who joke call him a "prolific writer" in both senses of the word. All the children have been baptized one after another. The family is harmonious and the sound of reading never stops, which can be called a model family. Wu often said that the Confucian requirements for family harmony are sometimes forced and rely on patience. But Wu's family, with parental love and filial piety, is naturally so. This trip to Rome will take months. Except for his eldest son, Zulin, who will remain in Shanghai, his wife and the rest of his children will travel with him to his post. The postal ship is well-equipped, and guests feel at home. The sea is vast and the sky is wide, so it must be enjoyable. I once jokingly said to Wu, "This can truly be called a total mobilization of the whole family." Wu turned to me and said, "With family traveling together, my native country is still in my heart. Looking at the difficult times, how can I stop myself?" Wu's deep concern for the country is overflowing in his words.</p>
<p>Beautiful Appearance and Diligent in Reading</p>
<p>Wu has a beautiful appearance, wears glasses, often wears a long robe, and his demeanor is natural. He is nearing the age of fifty, but looks like someone in his thirties. He reads very diligently, mostly late at night, with a volume in hand, happy and forgetting fatigue. His private residence is located on Extreme Civil Road in western Shanghai, and the collection [of books] is vast and rich. During the years of occupation, it was moved to a certain church, so it was preserved intact. Usually, he is addicted to cigarettes as his life, burning dozens of sticks a day as usual. Whenever he holds a pen, he consumes a lot, the smoke swirling around, and his thoughts flow incessantly.</p>
<p>Likes to Listen to Opera and Loves Mountains and Rivers</p>
<p>Wu also likes to listen to opera and is good at singing the "Selling Horses" section. He was a famous amateur opera singer in his early years. During the war, he lived in various places and moved several times. He lived under the Seven Star Rock in Guilin, rented a house near Huaxi in Guiyang, and lived in Beibei in Chongqing. The above places all have beautiful scenery, and Wu's writing has a lot of unique spirit.</p>

<h3>Arts and Life</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>By Cao Fu, Published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>Here, I want to introduce a book about self-cultivation for young people to young readers. However, this book, "The Art of Living," is different from the typical book on self-cultivation for young people. I believe everyone feels that young people need self-cultivation in academics, thought, emotions, and attitudes. However, what understanding and recognition young people themselves should have of self-cultivation is something no one can estimate. The reason is that grasping the meaning and goals of youth self-cultivation correctly cannot be done by those who only know how to write moralizing articles.</p>
<p>In the preface, "Starting from Inspirational Philosophy," the author explains the motivation for writing these articles. "The Art of Living" is not a book on self-cultivation with neatly arranged chapters and sections, but rather a collection of articles discussing the cultivation of life. Although the articles are scattered, the author writes with a consistent goal and thought. His main point is to reverse the past self-centered definition of cultivation and focus on the individual's adaptation to social life, correct the traditional error of isolating the individual from society, and expound on the significance and value of moral behavior in real-life practice. In the past, the author translated a book on self-cultivation by Dr. Marden, titled "Inspirational Philosophy," which had a significant impact on the spirit of young people. It must be said that the book made a special contribution to inspiring the ambition of young people and cultivating their character, but it inevitably leaned towards individualism. If one can grasp a relatively correct attitude, it is not necessarily harmful; it is just that there are too few people who can understand the way of self-cultivation with a correct attitude. The author treats writing these articles as a kind of "redemption," so the arguments made in this book are much more advanced than his previous translations.</p>
<p>Indeed, "Inspirational Philosophy," even if it has an encouraging and inspiring effect on young people, inevitably leads people to a narrow, individualistic "success." However, if one can filter out the individualism and bourgeois气息 (worldly atmosphere), it is undeniable that it is still beneficial to young people. For example, emphasizing the importance of subjective effort in one's personal life is very valuable.</p>
<p>The author of this book retains this advantage and gives young people's life cultivation a new assessment. He sees through the deceitful and flattering discussions of self-cultivation, whether Chinese or foreign. If self-cultivation is regarded as "dealing with the world" or "coping" with sophistication, or as a "means" of pleasing others, it is tantamount to instructing young people in the hypocritical methods of boasting, flattering, and wearing high hats, corrupting their minds and destroying their natural qualities. In recent years, books such as "How to Make Friends" and "The Way to Deal with the World" have been commonly seen in bookstores and sell very well. Young people are generally willing to spend a small amount of money to acquire the art of defeating others. In fact, talking about self-cultivation in this way is simply turning young people into cunning and slippery "worldly people."</p>
<p>There are also American-style discussions of self-cultivation that are close to bourgeois mentality. The author wants young people to have the ambition to surpass others, to strive for progress, to stand out from the crowd, and to become "people above others," just like the common Chinese people's hope for young people to "bring glory to their ancestors." This is entirely a vulgar worship of material desires and "success." Treating dealing with the world and treating people as a means to achieve the goal of "success," and even talking about personality and integrity for these reasons, makes the motivation for such self-cultivation impure.</p>
<p>The author wrote these articles with a view to enhancing the interest in life and expounding the art of living. As the name suggests, this book is called "The Art of Living" precisely to change people's general perception so that everyone recognizes that the cultivation of life is an art, and a noble ideal of life is indispensable for beautifying life. To pursue the art of living and the most valuable spiritual life is the ultimate goal of youth self-cultivation. On the stage of life, one can see all kinds of roles, some skillful and some clumsy, and the difference between them lies in the depth of artistic cultivation. Let us look at the art of living discussed by the author of this book, "The Art of Living," from the standpoint of an anti-individualist.</p>
<p>If there is anything different between this book and other similar books, it is mainly that it fundamentally discusses youth issues and life cultivation based on the principles of emerging psychology. The author believes that for young people to "settle down and establish themselves," they must seek psychological peace and find a place to entrust their spirit. Indeed, the suffering,烦恼 (worries), and sadness of young people are really due to the fact that their spirit has nowhere to turn. He said something very pertinent: "The most fundamental way to overcome all psychological illnesses is to entrust one's life to a cause and goal that is more important and more valuable than oneself. Other than that, all sermons about overcoming the psychological illnesses of young people, even if they can be effective, are only temporary pain relievers, sedatives, or even anesthetics. ... To seek a place to settle down and establish oneself outside of real life, if it is still possible, then the so-called establishing oneself is only establishing oneself in an ivory tower, and the so-called peace of mind is only ostrich-like苟安 (temporary ease)." From his words, one can see the fallacy of general empty talk about self-cultivation. Young people must be determined to make the country better and society better before they can find a place to anchor their spirit. Young people must not regard their profession merely as a way to solve their livelihood; they should stimulate the social significance of their work and find the permanent value of life. It is not enough to physically participate in a job; one must also add imagination and emotional enthusiasm. We very much agree with the author's highest ideal of youth self-cultivation: to participate in, promote, and facilitate the realization of an ideal social life.</p>
<p>At the same time, the author also points out that people who generally talk about youth self-cultivation seem to only talk about "character" but not about "morality." Most people confuse these two terms. Courage is a quality we must have, but if this quality is developed poorly, it is easy to produce evil results. One cannot say that robbers and spies are not courageous, nor can one say that they lack boldness, but their evil deeds do not meet moral standards. We certainly hate hypocrites who are full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, but we still want to praise genuine moral behavior. The most fully developed personality (which has gradually shifted from ethics to psychology) is what we should pursue. The author does not advocate listing moral behaviors as rules; he agrees with the moral cultivation of "major virtues do not exceed boundaries, and minor virtues can be flexible," and points out a path of youth self-cultivation: from "external refinement" to character, to morality, to the whole personality cultivation, and to the broad cultural cultivation. The included items are: "external refinement," character, morality, intellectual education, physical appearance, aesthetic education (art), and mental hygiene (emotional cultivation).</p>
<p>In the book, the Confucian "Great Learning" which states "The way of great learning consists in manifesting one's clear virtue, loving the people" is given an explanation. The author uses these words to explain public and private virtues. Manifesting one's clear virtue is private virtue, and loving the people is public virtue. The two are the obverse and reverse of the same thing, and must be linked together to exert the greatest effect of morality. The Song people divided the eight virtues of "investigating things, extending knowledge, rectifying the mind, making the will sincere, cultivating the person, regulating the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world" into two parts. The first half is the effort of sincerity and righteousness, and the second half is the effort of governing and pacifying. Above rectifying the mind and making the will sincere, there are still the two efforts of investigating things and extending knowledge. The author believes that investigating things and extending knowledge means grasping the correct method of thinking and making a correct understanding of the principles and methods of governing and pacifying, so it is still connected to the following section. The author does not agree with the division of private and public virtues. He believes that in fact, there are only minor virtues and major virtues. The minor points in private life are minor virtues, and governing and pacifying are major virtues. However, governing and pacifying must be motivated by rectifying the mind and making the will sincere, and guided by investigating things and extending knowledge, so major virtue is the unification of public and private virtues. Yes, we very much agree with the author's words that valuable cultural heritage should not be completely abandoned and completely obliterated; we must do the work of discarding and selecting. Except for the reactionary and poisonous, which cannot be allowed to exist, the ethical thoughts related to moral cultivation may as well be "re-evaluated" for their value.</p>
<p>Overall, although this book is compiled from scattered articles, because it was written with a consistent goal and a unique perspective, the various articles still feel closely connected in thought. The ordinary youth self-cultivation talks about things that are also expounded in this book. This is not empty talk, but the most needed problems to be solved in real life. The theory is mostly based on the principles of psychology, with philosophical judgments about life. However, it is not as dry and boring as other books on theory; it is really a very cordial conversation. Articles such as "A Confession of an Idealist," "Interest in Life," "Work," "Play," "Reading," "Love," and "Anti-Cynicism" all have novel and unique insights that are thought-provoking. In ordinary books on self-cultivation, at most, young people are told some abstract moral rules in a "preachy" way, how to conduct themselves in the world, how to treat people, how to please people, and how to achieve success and establish a career. In the end, everything is for one's own sake and for the sake of material desires. But what is discussed here belongs to the positive. The author emphasizes the importance of a sound personality and correct thinking for the life of young people. He wants young people to pursue the highest ideal of life (the ideal spiritual one), which is not only the cultivation of personal virtue, but also should further stimulate the highest and greatest value of life, promote the artistry of life, to purify life, and beautify life.</p>
<h3>"America and the Pacific"</h3>
<p>— Sun Jingzhi</p>
<p>By Li Xiefei, Published by Chunghwa Book Company, January 1946</p>
<p>The Pacific era, which has leapt from the prosperity of the Atlantic to become the focus of global attention, is unfolding. The United States is a major power in the northeast of the Pacific. Since its independence, its historical evolution, national growth, and development have been closely related to the Pacific. That is, it has always played a very important role in the Pacific international political arena. The 20th century was recognized as the Pacific century by general sighted politicians, and so far, the situation on the Pacific, the competition among the powers, has been changing under the tense and turbulent situation. The United States' influence in the Pacific started in the northeast, extended down to Hawaii in the mid-Pacific, and the Philippines in the western Pacific. After this war, it extended south to Japan and southeast to Korea on the edge of mainland China. The distribution of its sphere of influence is almost all over the Pacific, so there is an inseparable relationship between the United States and the Pacific. Whether one wants to study American history or the international political disputes in the Pacific in recent centuries, one must understand the historical relationship between the United States and the Pacific.</p>
<p>In the book "America and the Pacific" by Mr. Li Xiefei, he divides it into eight chapters. Chapter 1, "The Natural Trend of the Development of American National Power," describes the consistent westward movement of the United States after its birth, which is the historical origin of the United States and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Chapter 2, "International Politics in the Pacific in the 19th Century," describes the decline of the power of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain in the Pacific, the establishment of the British Empire's hegemony, and the rise of the new forces of Japan and the United States. The competition among the powers in mainland China created the complex situation in the Pacific in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, "The Relationship between the United States and China and Japan," from the establishment of the relationship between the United States and China, to the rise of Japanese imperialism, formed an adversarial situation between the United States and Japan in China's sphere of influence.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, "The Development of American Power in the Pacific," the westward development of the United States reached the Mississippi River basin in 1803, Oregon in the mid-19th century, Alaska from Russia in 1867, and naval bases such as the Philippines, Hawaii, and Guam at the end of the 19th century. The opening of the Panama Canal brought the United States and the Pacific into a new stage, and the United States' power in the Pacific consolidated its foundation.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, "The Open Door Policy and the Washington Conference," after the Sino-Japanese War, the powers' ambition to divide China intensified. The United States vigorously advocated the Open Door Policy, prompting various countries to establish a strategy towards China, and supporting the ten years of peace and balance in the Pacific international community. The convening of the Washington Conference determined several principles, the Four-Power Pacific Treaty, the Five-Power Naval Treaty, and the Nine-Power Treaty, consolidating the situation in the Far East. The limitation of armaments further maintained peace.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, "The United States' Far East Policy after the September 18th Incident," the United States' foreign policy has always had its consistent purpose. The Open Door Policy was advocated first, and the Nine-Power Treaty followed. After the "September 18th Incident," the situation in the Far East changed drastically, but the United States never changed its attitude; it strengthened the flexibility of its policy. The Stimson Doctrine of non-recognition is one example. After Roosevelt was elected president, the United States changed its isolationism—breaking its historical silence, and took a positive measure and expression against Japan's aggressive ambitions, creating a trend in which the United States and Japan were bound to fight in their policies.</p>
<p>Chapter 7, "The Pacific War after the Attack on Pearl Harbor and the Responsibilities of the United States after the War," the attack on Pearl Harbor marked the beginning of the Pacific War. The situation of the two major groups in the world was established. The Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan and the anti-aggression Allied countries of the United States, China, and Britain launched a comprehensive world war. On January 1, 1941, the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union signed a joint declaration, clarifying the common purpose and principles of the war. On January 1 of the following year, it was formally signed, and 26 countries, including Australia, Belgium, and Canada, joined, which laid the foundation for the tasks and victory of the countries in the war. During the war, the United States always shouldered great responsibilities in the Pacific, and after the war, how to solve Japan's ambitions, assist China's construction, preside over the autonomy of various ethnic groups, and establish peaceful relations in the Pacific, the United States still has responsibilities.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, "The United States and the Pacific in the Post-War Outlook," in the post-war Pacific, the relationship with the United States will inevitably become closer. In this Pacific international circle surrounded by 19 independent countries, the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and Britain occupy important positions. The United States' power has now moved from the north of the Pacific to the central and southern parts, occupying a more central position. Its future policies, the establishment of relations between the United States and China, the United States and the Soviet Union, and the cooperation and development of the countries in the Pacific, and the maintenance of peace in the Pacific, the United States already has the decisive ability.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Xiefei's book was completed on March 1, 1945, and was published by Chunghwa Book Company at the beginning of this year. It can be considered a new book. The content is very rich, especially the last three chapters have more information. If you want to study history or international issues, it is worth buying for reference.</p>
<h3>Introducing Several Publications on Industry</h3>
<p>— Shao Qiu</p>
<p>This is a cliché that is unbearably俗不可耐 (banal): "China's industry is too underdeveloped." But despite saying it, who is really working on reviving and building China's industry? Therefore, China's industry since the founding of the Republic of China 35 years ago is still in the infancy stage, not even weaned yet. And due to the underdevelopment of China's industry, the depression of China's industrial publishing industry is also closely linked, and these two aspects have a mutual cause and effect relationship.</p>
<p>Because I am engaged in industry, recently I took advantage of my position to visit the industrial publishing industry in Shanghai. Here I sincerely recommend these three industrial publications that are very worth reading to those who care about China's industry and future—Engineering World, Textile Dyeing Monthly, and Fiber Monthly.</p>
<p>Engineering World</p>
<p>This is published by the Chinese Technical Research Society since it moved to Shanghai last November after the victory. At that time, the format was very small, only four pages of eight-page newspaper, and because it was limited by economic conditions and the limited spare time of the person in charge, there was nothing to talk about. However, after suspending publication for two months in June of this year, it resumed publication in August, and the resumed Engineering World has a completely new look. Everything about the content, layout, printing, and manuscripts has been significantly improved. And the format has also expanded a lot (about 60 pages of 16-page format). Is this really because the advertising is squeezed in, which has increased economic strength? Of course, the efforts of its person in charge cannot be ignored. And here I will make a brief review of the contents of the recent two issues, October and November of Engineering World: it is too biased towards theory and translation, so there are relatively few articles on textiles and civil engineering. Because although "industry" is only two words, the scope is quite broad, and Engineering World is named after this broad name, then the content should also be uniform, and there should be some about all aspects of engineering world. However, Engineering World has a lifetime characteristic, that is, there are many illustrations and photos, which other industrial publications do not have. Furthermore, according to the Engineering World's name, the format can be expanded a bit for the sake of uniform content.</p>
<p>Fiber Industry</p>
<p>This is a textile industry journal. First, let me say that the fate of this journal is very pitiful. Since it was published in October last year after the victory, it has only published five issues in more than a year, although it is said to be a monthly publication. In the meantime, it has been suspended for four consecutive months. This is because the person in charge is困于 (troubled by) time constraints. Because in the fiber industry, advertising is much more than in Engineering World. The format of Fiber Industry is also about 20 pages more than that of Engineering World. And in terms of content, it really focuses on the fiber textile industry. But it is almost entirely reprinted from British and American magazines. And there are too few illustrations, and although the manuscripts are very uniform, they are not neat enough. But Fiber Industry also has a characteristic, that is, the price is very cheap. A very thick volume with very generous and gorgeous装璜 (decorations) and printing only sells for 500 yuan. The most recent issue also only sells for 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Textile Dyeing Monthly</p>
<p>Not only is it relatively the best among the three industrial publications I introduced, but it is also difficult to find in the entire industrial publishing industry in Shanghai or China. Because apart from a cover that is not as gorgeous as Fiber Industry and as simple as Engineering World, but is somewhat顯 (obvious) but反单调 (not monotonous), it is very uniform, clear, novel, and neat in other aspects such as content, printing, layout, and manuscript acquisition. Especially Textile Dyeing, which has been in its second volume, has had even greater improvements, and what is especially worth mentioning is that the manuscripts of Textile Dyeing are far more domestic than translated ones. This is also worth mentioning today in China's industrial publishing industry, where translations overwhelm original works. The most recent issue of Textile Dyeing has also added a column introducing textile industrialists and added many photos and illustrations. This is very valuable. However, its price seems to be a bit too expensive, costing 2,000 yuan, because in my opinion, general young students who are interested in industrial research cannot afford it. Furthermore, the number of advertisements in Textile Dyeing is comparable to that in Fiber Industry, so why is Textile Dyeing Monthly more expensive? It is also worth mentioning that Textile Dyeing also has a characteristic that it never misses an issue. It is always published on time on the 15th of each month. Therefore, it seems that Textile Dyeing is the most promising one in the difficult and萧条 (depressed) industrial publishing industry.</p>
<h3>Child Rearing Methods</h3>
<p>— Ye Jinchun, translated by Huang Jiayin, published by Benfeng Society</p>
<p>I remember that Lao Lin once chatted with me and said: "When I got married, my friends also gave me two books about marital life and self-cultivation. I still haven't finished reading them, but since I had A Dong and Xiao Pang, for their sake, I bought more than a dozen books about raising children. After reading them, I still feel that I lack too much knowledge in this area."</p>
<p>I think there is some reason in these words, because maintaining a harmonious family, although it requires the efforts of both husband and wife to implement many basic principles, because of the love between men and women and the adaptation of adults to new environments, some difficulties are still easy to overcome. Only with these generally innocent children, because our prejudices are too deep, and the children's actions are innocent and their preferences are very different, there are many questions about the children that we cannot answer. Many of the children's actions are handled inappropriately by us, and as for the attention to children's nutrition and the care of diseases, which involves some specialized knowledge, we are even more at a loss when asked. So no wonder Lao Lin feels棘手 (thorny).</p>
<p>Generally, more responsible parents have no choice but to study in books when they encounter this situation. Speaking of books about teaching and raising children, I have read several books in Chinese and English. Based on what I have read, I think they inevitably have various shortcomings. Some are too theoretical, and some are too specialized. Some books are mostly compiled and translated from foreign books, and they often fail to choose appropriately, but only整摭杂取 (patchwork together) odds and ends, so that the books have too much foreign flavor.</p>
<p>Because there are not many good books of this kind (it is really not easy to be good), I recently saw a product that is差强人意 (barely satisfactory) and I am very willing to推　 (recommend) it to the public.</p>
<p>The book I want to talk about is called "Child Rearing Methods," translated by Shen Chenshi, edited and proofread by Huang Jiayin, published by Xifeng Magazine in October this year. The whole book has two hundred and six pages, and the price is three thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The original text of "Child Rearing Methods" was compiled by the Children's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor. It has been revised several times after publication. Children's health experts from major hospitals in the United States participated in the compilation and revision, so the content is very practical, and the compilers may have spent some effort to make a selection on the subject matter, so after reading it, it does not feel "unsuitable for the national conditions" or "蹈高惊远" (aim too high and scare people away).</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into eleven chapters, namely "Infancy to Childhood," "The Child's Environment," "Maintaining Health and Avoiding Disease," "Disease Prevention Methods," "Teeth," "Food and Eating Habits," "Sleep and Sleeping Habits," "Clothing," "Games," "Child Development," and "Sick Children." Each chapter details the nutrition of the child's body and also the陶育 (cultivation) of intellectual habits, which can be said to emphasize both "teaching" and "raising." The book does not emphasize theory, but lists methods, and the methods are all written based on correct theories and experience. The writing style is clear and smooth, and it does not feel沉闷 (dull) when reading it. I think that a book about teaching and raising children that can be compiled in this way is already very satisfactory. I hope that after this book is published, it will be reviewed by domestic children's health experts, and some of the more special problems of Chinese children will be added to make it the most perfect children's teaching and raising book in our country.</p>

<h3>Preface to Mr. Yang Wei-yun's Eightieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Qian Jibo</p>
<p>In the auspicious days of the first month of the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Yang Wei-yun, an elder of the village, celebrates his eightieth birthday. The erudite Guan Tongyi entrusted me with writing a congratulatory essay, saying, "My father has experienced many trials, yet he has long admired your lofty integrity. Despite my lack of talent, I am honored to be considered your disciple. For seventy years, I have wished to receive your guidance to please my father, but you declined, citing family duties. For the past decade, the Eastern barbarians have been ruthless, indulging their greed like boars and snakes, wreaking havoc upon our land. The divine land has been devastated, warhorses roam the suburbs, the nation lacks strong defenses, and the people lack firm resolve. Surviving with humiliation is considered fortunate. Yet, my father has maintained his integrity and remained steadfast in the face of adversity. Relatives dare not sway him with personal favors, and villains cannot steal his principles. He has bided his time in Tianjin, concealing his brilliance while remaining clear-sighted, and hopes for eternal life to witness the restoration of our nation. This is the benefit of persevering in hardship, and it is also what you have foreseen. If I can obtain your essay to honor my father's aspirations, it will not only be a toast to celebrate this day, but also an inspiration for the timid and a model for generations to come." Though I, Jibo, am an old man devoted to the classics, living in solitude, Mr. Yang is twenty years my senior and achieved eminence early, benefiting many. His reputation is well-known, and those who praise his virtues by discussing the past and present fill the room. There is no shortage of talented writers, so why seek out a poor scholar like me to write this? I believe the reason Tongyi asked me is that his words are sincere, their meaning profound, and related to moral instruction, so I cannot refuse.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang was known for his literary talent from an early age and was knowledgeable in all fields. He passed the Shun Tian provincial examination in the seventeenth year of the Guangxu era and became a Compiler of the Grand Secretariat in the late Qing dynasty. He dedicated himself to the great cause of managing the world, and upon imperial decree, he accompanied the five ministers on a fact-finding mission, traveling to various European and American countries and even the islands of Southeast Asia, gaining extensive knowledge of foreign affairs. His writings synthesize the past and present, elaborating on details and carefully analyzing issues, aiming for practical implementation. However, his ideas were not adopted. He drafted memorials for many prominent figures, the most important of which were advocating for constitutionalism to express public opinion, reforming the official system to purify governance, and establishing a budget to control national expenditures, among many other proposals for the nation. I once wrote a preface to Mr. Yang's "Sikun Wenchao Biechao," which dealt with these matters. However, his suggestions were not heeded, and the Qing dynasty collapsed. After the founding of the Republic of China, when the President was still cautious, Mr. Yang served as the Vice Minister of Finance under the first Minister. He was prudent and measured, assigned people according to their abilities, did not lightly increase taxes to exploit the people, and did not issue public bonds to bankrupt the nation. He rejected loan proposals from various provinces, both domestic and foreign, saying, "I have been in charge of finance for years and have never signed a single bond contract. I can claim innocence to the people." Seeing that those in charge of the nation and its finances after the sixth year of the Republic of China considered borrowing to be the primary policy and the ability to borrow the greatest talent, he could not help but indignantly say, "Other countries use public bonds to supplement their finances, but our country uses public bonds to destroy them. When I accompanied the delegation abroad, French financier Dr. Penk told me that a country's indiscriminate issuance of public bonds is tantamount to entrusting its finances to banks, causing the government to lose its power to balance and adjust. Banks prioritize profit above all else, and the government is controlled by them. The drawbacks are countless." These words were full of emotion. Before that, during the late Qing dynasty, there was interaction between officials and merchants that touched upon national laws and regulations. If one did not value one's reputation, impeachment would follow. However, this practice gradually declined towards the end of the dynasty. Even so, the compradors of HSBC could only sit in the tea room of the Ministry of Revenue, waiting for officials to receive them. Since the Republic of China, the Director-General and Vice-Ministers began to treat bank managers as equals. With the implementation of the public bond policy, banks gained power, and Director-Generals and Vice-Ministers rushed to please them, fearing to be late for bank association meetings. National principles were swept aside. Mr. Yang said, "The country has its own system. How can I bow to others' will?" Yet, the annual revenue of the national treasury, eighty to ninety million, was mortgaged to banks, and the custody of the public bond funds was entrusted to the customs commissioner, Anger. Thus, the lifeline of the nation's finances was controlled by foreigners, and those in charge of finance could only follow their orders. Later, the Americans convened the Washington Conference, and the Nine-Power Treaty was signed, stipulating that China would implement a five percent ad valorem tariff, which could increase annual revenue by more than ten million taels. Anger then submitted the Witt Internal Debt Tax Bill, intending to allocate the additional tariff revenue to six public bond funds, including financial funds. Those who held public bonds all echoed this proposal, but Mr. Yang opposed it, saying, "The new tariff revenue and the monthly surplus revenue of more than three million are now used to supplement government expenses. Anger is ostensibly reorganizing, but in reality, he is controlling the customs revenue, privately investigating the draw, setting the deadlines, and purchasing pounds at will, without the Ministry of Finance's involvement. He is taking advantage of the government's urgency, using the stored tariff revenue to issue public bonds, half of which is consumed by interest. Officials are clamoring for the issuance of public bonds, showing joy as if they were reborn, not realizing who is causing the depletion of their marrow. Those in charge of finance must rely on Anger's approval and align with the banks. Otherwise, they will face criticism and slander, making it impossible to have peace of mind. I have been indignant about this for a long time, unable to stop the tide. How can I praise them?" Pursuing profit became the norm. Newspapers demanded subsidies, and if they were not granted, they would launch attacks. Councilors requested favors, and if they were not granted, they would propose impeachments. Anger's influence grew, and he said to Mr. Yang, "What I have studied is China's financial history, and what I have examined is the financial systems of various countries. In the past six years, national expenditures have been extravagant, and accountants have used fake figures and deviated from normal procedures for personal gain. How can my ideas be implemented?" He resigned due to illness and refused to return. After that, Anger was able to pursue his ambitions, using the customs revenue to manipulate public bonds, accumulating tens of millions of dollars. In the winter of the fifteenth year, Gu Weijun became the Prime Minister and resolutely dismissed Anger. When Anger left office, he privately embezzled four million in customs revenue and deposited it in HSBC. When the Ministry of Finance investigated and impeached him, Anger had already fled overseas, beyond the reach of justice. Only then did people realize Anger's treachery and recognize Mr. Yang's patriotism and integrity as unattainable.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang participated in key government affairs early on, but escaped slander. He was in charge of finance for a long time, but did not enrich himself. The President entrusted him with the position of Minister, sincerely seeking his advice. He aroused no suspicion, had friends all over the world, and loved people widely. He once said to Tongyi's brother, "In this era, how can we find such virtuous gentlemen to help us overcome difficulties? Just let them do their best." Many people thought Mr. Yang was indiscriminate in his dealings with people, but they did not know that he was broad-minded in his interactions but upright in his conduct, civilized internally but gentle externally. When it came to righteousness, he stood alone, unmoved by the clamor of the crowd. When he felt a connection with someone, he treated them with sincerity, without seeking glory or reward. Li Yuanhong and Zhang Xun experienced different fortunes, but their friendship remained steadfast. Xu Shichang had a teacher-student relationship with him, and Wang Shizhen, Duan Qirui, and Feng Guozhang were all close friends of the family. They shared mutual respect but never sought advancement through him. His advancement was not due to others, and his retreat was not due to others. When the Eastern barbarians committed atrocities and seized Chinese territory, they sought out people of prestige to sway public opinion. Few prominent figures remained untainted. Many high-ranking officials in the new regime were his acquaintances. Tianjin was under the control of the Eastern barbarians, and slander filled the air, harboring filth and accepting corruption. All the evils of the world gathered there. Mr. Yang had been living in Tianjin for a long time, and the foreigners used him as their eyes and ears, but they dared not use any official position to tempt him, nor did anyone try to persuade him with flattering words. He remained aloof from worldly affairs, cultivating his virtue in seclusion. It was not difficult for Mr. Yang to maintain his integrity in times of crisis, but what was difficult was that people expected Mr. Yang to live in a land of nothingness.</p>
<p>Guan Yinzi, between Liezi, said, "The most virtuous man walks in stealth without emptiness, steps on fire without heat, walks above all things without fear. How can he achieve this?" Guan Yinzi said, "It is the preservation of pure Qi, not the realm of wisdom, skill, courage, and decisiveness. He will reside in the deepest depths and hide in the realm of the beginningless, wandering in the realm where all things end and begin, unifying his nature, nourishing his Qi, embracing his virtue, to understand the creation of things. If he is like this, his heavenly protection is complete, and his spirit is unwavering, so nothing can harm him." Observing Mr. Yang's experience of extreme vicissitudes and his transcendence beyond the realm of appearances, facing danger as if it were flat ground, acting as if nothing had happened, is this not what is meant by embracing his virtue to understand the creation of things, so nothing can harm him? This is truly the so-called virtuous man of ancient times, encountering the end and beginning of all things. For thousands of years, he will be one with the world. His virtue is like the Huai River, flowing endlessly. Therefore, his life is not lacking, so why should I praise him to pray for longevity?</p>
<h3>Sheep Herd</h3>
<p>— Lu Yang</p>
<p>The hunting dogs are speeding across the sandy hills of the wilderness; they no longer need to be overly alert and wary, as they do in the mountains, guarding the newborn lambs. In groups of three or five, they frantically sniff at tree trunks and grass roots, suddenly darting off like arrows to pounce on flocks of sparrows pecking at manure piles; startled, the sparrows fly away, and the dogs instinctively bark loudly at the sky a few times, the sound reverberating in this boundless space, full of wildness in its clarity. Then, wagging their hairy, thick tails, they scurry back into the ranks of the sheep herd. How much they love their homeland! They have been running around every alley in Zhuangzi since they were young.</p>
<p>The peasant women, carrying their children, run out, naggingly asking how many lambs their sheep have given birth to, whether any have been snatched away by evil birds. The shepherds respond warmly and tactfully, while the cowherds with sickles stuck in their waists chuckle on the side.</p>
<p>Now, the shepherds are beginning to work as woodcutters or plasterers; the adult shepherds, bundled in thick furs, their wrinkled faces ravaged by wind and sand reddened by old wine, slip into the gambling dens of the villages. The sheep herd has changed masters, and at sunrise and sunset, shepherdesses drive the sheep herd out of and into the village.</p>
<p>The shepherdesses' light shadows appear and disappear on the hillsides, in the fields, and on the sand dunes; the sheep herd lies docilely, wandering; the hunting dogs still race around; even though the wild wind is so strong, and occasionally crystal-clear snowflakes swirl.</p>
<p>In winter, the sheep herd is driven back to the village from the mountains, returning to the owners' thatched sheds and fences, spending this period of wind, snow, hardship, and cold.</p>
<p>Farmers compete to treat the shepherds well, hoping that the sheep herd will "lie in the field" on their own land; because in places where the sheep herd lingers for three or five days, there will naturally be rich and fresh fertilizer left behind, and won't there be a better harvest next year?</p>
<p>The wind and snow become more and more cruel with each passing day, but the wool on the sheep becomes denser and thicker, which is the shepherds' gambling capital. Next spring, when the flowers bloom, they should gather together and go to the mountains to "cut wild grass," another thrilling and magnificent journey!</p>
<h3>Brief History of Musicians</h3>
<p>— Mozart</p>
<p>A German, one of the "Vienna Trio," an unprecedentedly amazing prodigy in the music world. His works are delicate and touching, light and gentle. He wrote a great deal throughout his life, making particular contributions to opera and instrumental music. His life was unusually short, dying at the age of only thirty-five. Born in 1756, died in 1791. ·Sky·</p>
<h3>Lily</h3>
<p>— by Schmanski, translated by Liu Ling</p>
<p>Life is like a pasture. It has all sorts of colors, and many flowers grow on it. Deceit grows after purity, and malice follows kindness, with kindness and love standing side by side in sorrow.</p>
<p>Thus, all sorts of colors drowned me; mystery surrounded me; the shadow of life was revealed from the mirror.</p>
<p>I stood hesitant. Life is very easy to fail in; very difficult to understand; very impossible to succeed in.</p>
<p>And I lost myself in a veil of hope and illusion, in a sea of destruction and ruin, in an ignorant night of shedding meaningless tears.</p>
<p>Truth is revolving between right nourishing and justice.</p>
<p>I walked from one flower to another, and finally I stopped in front of the lily. So I embraced her with both hands, murmuring: "I love you - because I adore everything that possesses beauty."</p>
<p>But the lily answered, "Don't talk to me about love. Life is a perpetual battlefield. You must be calm, hard-hearted, and prepared to cope with that battle. But remember never to disclose your name. Go out and show your face, but your heart must be concealed. Let it stay under a layer of invisible armor. Because only the person who speaks his own name is the defeated, only the person who pours out his heart is a fool. Because you are a hero, and heroes are fighting without a name and without a heart, so don't talk about love or emotion."</p>
<p>A hero did not answer.</p>
<p>And I just revered flowers,</p>
<p>A strange, white flower…</p>
<p>Snow, such transparent snow in a white, boundless black garment. Dangerous white petals, why do you abandon me? The clamor of pure power, why do your fingers draw stars? Why does your burning moon dance a dance of desire on my heart?</p>
<p>Blindness in white.</p>
<p>The wheel of the earth shattered in mid-flight; my magical mouth rules the world; my body is power, intelligence is my gaze - only the moon no longer turns. And on the crystal orbit, my power of the night's work, the same energy that originally created the world, finally disintegrates, pushing itself into destruction with its own destructive power; ambition with the mask of death parades high in the treasury.</p>
<p>"No," I shouted, "unless the rain ceaselessly cries to the unfortunate ocean, do not force me to accept ambition."</p>
<p>But the white petals burned my eyes; their pure roots pierced my skin, and the world still existed, still to live for many centuries.</p>
<p>"Will I have power in the future?" I asked.</p>
<p>A flame arose.</p>
<p>"And will I become omnipotent?"</p>
<p>And the flame gradually grew larger.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" I asked softly,</p>
<p>At the same time, the flame engulfed me.</p>
<p>Finally, it turned dark, and the lily withered.</p>
<h3>Postscript to the Reissue of "New Acting Manual"</h3>
<p>— Tian Qin</p>
<p>This booklet was being translated during a period of continuous enemy bombing. It accompanied the translator through countless air raid alerts and shelters, finally able to be published in Guilin, the cultural city of the rear, before the Xianggui Campaign.</p>
<p>I remember that before publication, Brother Jinglu sent a letter to solicit my opinion on the title. Because I translated the original word for word as New Acting Manual. Brother Jinglu thought that this name seemed a bit stiff, so he wrote several names in the letter, asking me to choose. At this moment, I still vaguely remember one or two of them, such as Twelve Lectures on the Art of Drama, Actor's Handbook... At the time, I also had my prejudices, thinking that the former was too academic, but I was very satisfied with the latter, so I wrote back to decide to change it to "Actor's Handbook." Soon, Brother Jinglu discovered that "Actor's Handbook" was used first by Mr. Du Xuan's translation, so he still adopted the translator's original translation name.</p>
<p>After the book was published, it was still during the Anti-Japanese War, so it could only be sold in the southwest. Now that victory has been achieved for many years, the translator eagerly wants to reprint it, hoping to widely teach drama workers all over the country. Coincidentally, when I boarded the Minquan Wheel eastward in November, I stopped in Hankou for five hours. When I went ashore to visit Brother Jinglu on Jiaotong Road and talked about the reprint, Brother Jinglu expressed his approval. Because the type of my humble translation was spared during the Xianggui retreat (Note: Shanghai Magazine Company lost a lot of type during the Xianggui retreat). Otherwise, it would be extremely difficult to reprint recently.</p>
<p>After considering each other, we decided to change the translation name from "New Acting Manual" to "Actor's Handbook." Before the translator came to Suzhou on the ninth, he received a letter from Brother Jinglu in Nanjing urging him to send the original book and the reprint postscript, so while enjoying the scenery of Jiangnan, he specially drafted the postscript to explain the reasons for the name change, to commemorate the reprint.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 126</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"You may not be happy with what I'm saying, and you may think I'm being too harsh on you, but in my sacred duty, I can only do this. I hope you can forgive me. As for the second point, I can answer you clearly: Your actions are your freedom, and I can't interfere. In other words, you can do whatever you want. But I have to state in advance that I consider myself a person who is more rational than emotional. I am very grateful for your kindness to me, but you will have to bear the responsibility for the consequences. I can't be any clearer than that..."</p>
<p>"One more thing, I have now decided to take back my question!... Because I asked it too clumsily, too bluntly, and too embarrassingly for you... Other than that, I hope our conversation will come to an end for now. This is just a change in my thinking, and it is not influenced by you in the slightest. You don't have to worry about it. One last sentence: If possible, I plan to go back to the mainland tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Pingzi did not transcend the gentleness and absolute obedience of Japanese women. She was also more intelligent than the average person, knowing about Tsurumi's thoughts and dramatic changes. Therefore, she respected Tsurumi's opinions and did not drag out the question and conversation, knowing that it would be a waste of time. Five minutes later, this beach and the half-moon restored the tranquility of nature, erasing the colors of human intrigue, a very discordant stain.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, a medium-sized sports car sped along the highway from Matsushima to Tokyo, driven by the wild boar, with Tsurumi sitting beside him. In order to avoid unexpected troubles from several hostile groups, the two of them put on some simple disguises, making it impossible to recognize their true faces for a while.</p>
<p>In the car, Tsurumi carefully examined the various reports that the wild boar brought him, using a specially installed small electric light. What he paid most attention to, of course, was the dramatic change in the situation at Changxing Store, and the matter of Yaoqun and Xiaokaolu. - From participating in the Tong Dian Uprising to his disappearance -. These two things, of course, stirred up no small amount of agitation in his thoughts and emotions. On these two reports, he drafted the ways to deal with them, wrote notes, and asked the wild boar to hand them over to No. 012, the person in charge of the Tokyo organization, to handle them according to the instructions. (The way to handle it has already been explained in the secret telegram Yue Jun received in the previous article, so it is not repeated here).</p>
<p>The report included a telegram from the mainland headquarters, ordering Tsurumi to return to Shenyang as soon as possible, because the intelligence agencies in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other places in China need to be reorganized due to military developments and deployments. The order was forwarded by the Internal General Staff Headquarters. The director of the General Staff Headquarters' telecommunications department wrote on the order, "Order the officer to reply by telegram quickly and take action as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The most exciting thing in the report for Tsurumi was that someone in his Tokyo secret organization had accurately found out where the "Seven Sealed Letters" were stored and was already preparing for inside cooperation. The report only contained a few sentences written in secret language. As for who was in charge of the search, how they prepared for inside cooperation, and other details, he could only ask the wild boar.</p>
<p>"Who found the storage warehouse for the 'goods'?" Tsurumi asked with an excited smile. "Goods" of course refers to the "Seven Sealed Letters."</p>

<h3>Never Old</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Boling returned from overseas yesterday. This never-old old man, when we think of his famous saying "Go to the road with the greatest resistance," which he practiced himself, we cannot help but feel respectful.</p>
<p>Mr. Boling has been engaged in education all his life, forty years as one day. Nankai has made contributions to the nation and the country, which is an undeniable fact. If he had still been working in the naval field until now, the impact he would have produced would probably not exceed his achievements in presiding over Nankai!</p>
<p>Before the victory in Hankou, in Chongqing, and in the National Political Council, I often heard Mr. Zhang speaking on the podium. His low voice explained his age, but few people who heard his voice were not moved. But he never admitted to being old. Unless he fell asleep, he never missed a meeting of the National Political Council and never interrupted the handling of Nankai's affairs.</p>
<p>What was most worrying was Mr. Zhang's serious illness between the spring and summer of last year. Everyone was concerned and wished him a speedy recovery. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also personally visited him. Sure enough, he recovered soon after. This time he returned from overseas recuperation, I think his health is even better, and his work will be even more vigorous.</p>
<p>This is the best standard, explaining the following four things to us from Mr. Zhang's life and behavior:</p>
<p>(1) Perseverance</p>
<p>(2) Eternal Youth</p>
<p>(3) Fearlessness of Difficulty</p>
<p>(4) Planned Career</p>
<p>If we can have the above conditions in life, what can't be done? Naturally, we will be successful in everything.</p>
<h3>Mobile Cinema</h3>
<p>— Jin Danshu</p>
<p>"Please ship a mobile cinema with a capacity of 1,200 guests immediately."</p>
<p>When we see this note, we will definitely feel a little embarrassed, but in a few years, these order forms will fly around like snowflakes. Now in California, USA, someone is designing a mobile cinema palace that can accommodate 1,200 viewers.</p>
<p>The equipment inside this mobile cinema is all manufactured according to standard sizes, so the same equipment can be disassembled and assembled freely, like the various parts in a jeep. These detachable equipment include roof truss structure, roof, panel, ceiling, floor, seats, lighting, lead pipe and interior decoration. In the planned plan, equipment that can broadcast wireless radio will be installed, so that exciting scenes such as horse racing and baseball can be unfolded in front of the audience.</p>
<h3>A Mobile Cinema Illustration</h3>
<p>The only requirement is a simple reinforced concrete foundation. Then, in a very short period, an ordinary open space is transformed into a cinema palace equipped with the latest sound, light, and seating facilities from Hollywood.</p>
<p>The planned mobile cinemas will have seating for 1,200, as well as two other sizes with 800 and 1,000 seats respectively. The entire structure is made of stainless steel, while the internal panels are composed of two layers of corrugated metal sheets. The walls, regardless of height or width, are mainly composed of asbestos and gypsum, and have been proven absolutely safe after multiple fire tests. The floors, walls, roof, and flat ceiling are all connected with special screws, making them resistant to fire and earthquakes, while the internal air conditioning is excellent.</p>
<p>The interior is very spacious, making it both comfortable and easy to clean. The seat cushions are made of sponge-like rubber (spring cushions are clearly outdated), making them wide and comfortable. The corridor walls are entirely made of streamlined metal sheets. Small lights are installed in the aisles between seats, completely under the floor, saving space,不易損壞,便捷美觀.</p>
<p>If you find the walls not beautiful enough, you can order ready-made curtains, and a set of beautifully patterned curtains will be delivered quickly, ready for installation.</p>
<p>In Shanghai today, where materials and labor costs are incredibly high, a mobile cinema that can be shipped immediately is truly the most cost-effective option. A mobile cinema with 1,000 seats is priced at US$70,000, while building a cinema in the United States with the same capacity would cost US$150,000.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this new invention is a great help to smaller towns with sparse populations, so people who crave to see movies no longer have to travel long distances. After being shown in one place for a few days or months, this mobile cinema can easily complete its relocation.</p>
<p>The mobile cinemas currently being designed can be conveniently packaged, taking up very little space, and can be transported by ships, railways, or three or four ordinary trucks.</p>
<p>According to expert estimates, this "rare commodity" has a wide world market, especially in South American countries, China, and the Soviet Union. It is estimated that 30,000 to 40,000 units can be sold in each location. After two years of painstaking research, the planned mobile cinema now has broad adaptability, and can easily adapt to environments from the cold of Siberia to the hot and humid equatorial regions.</p>
<p>According to a recent study by the National Theatre Corporation of America, this mobile cinema may have the latest sound and projection equipment. As for wireless facsimile movies, they have also entered the final stage of experimentation, requiring only the installation of an antenna.</p>

<h3>High-Interest Loans in the "Lower Class Society"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ji</p>
<p>Not far from North Sichuan Road, there is a small town. This is where lower-class compatriots are concentrated. Most of them are rickshaw pullers and dockworkers. They live in thatched huts. But there are also two *shikumen* alleyways, where the so-called more advanced people live. This place is truly "small but complete," with a small street containing barbershops, pharmacies, pawnshops, small theaters, and snack shops, everything one would need. It represents a society in miniature.</p>
<p>Because they cannot make a living in their hometowns and due to job search reasons, a large number of people from northern Jiangsu have come to Shanghai. Because many relatives and friends are concentrated here, many thatched huts have been added to this small town out of thin air. Those who escaped of course have no money, so many high-interest loans have emerged. They dare to use high-interest loans because they can immediately rent a rickshaw or carriage after borrowing money, and can earn ten to twenty thousand a day, and can slowly pay it off.</p>
<p>Speaking of high-interest loans here, it is a bit scary. Interest is calculated on a daily basis. A polite one calculates three percent interest a day, that is, borrowing 10,000 yuan has a daily interest of 300 yuan. If calculated on a monthly basis, borrowing 10,000 yuan requires paying 19,000 yuan at the end of the month. If you need it urgently, you have to pay five percent interest per day. There is also a type of interest that is paid daily, with a monthly interest of fifty percent. For example, if you borrow 20,000 yuan, you pay 1,000 yuan a day, for a total of 30,000 yuan in a month. Both principal and interest are cleared. The borrower pays 1,000 yuan a day, feeling that the burden is not heavy, while the lender has dozens of debtors, and the money received every day can be lent out again, so it grows more and more.</p>
<p>Most of the lenders are local "bullies," but they are not all enjoying the benefits without working for them. Their lending conditions are:</p>
<p>1. Have a job,</p>
<p>2. Have a place to live,</p>
<p>3. Have a wife and children.</p>
<p>When lending money, the debtor seeks them out. When collecting money, the lender must come in person, because the lender knows the debtor's temperament. They like to delay for three or five days. The first time when negotiating, the other party asks for a delay of one or two days, which can be accommodated. But the second time they still don't pay, the creditor shows their skills, rolls up their sleeves, pulls the top button of the traditional Chinese jacket backward, and starts cursing, taking anything they see. The other party will obediently take out the money. More skilled lenders, after offending the debtor, will try to put on a clown face to make the other party laugh, so that the other party will not bear a grudge and not come to borrow money next time. This may seem unbelievable.</p>
<p>Lenders have all become rich. Of course, there are also cases where both principal and interest are lost, but the amount they lend is as much as 80,000 to 100,000, and as little as 30,000 to 50,000. Nowadays, coolies and rickshaw pullers, as long as they have the strength, can easily earn money. Who would run away for a few tens of thousands of yuan?</p>
<p>Don't look down on rickshaw pullers. Their material enjoyment is sometimes better than those who wear long gowns. One rickshaw puller came to Shanghai penniless a few years ago. Now he has built a bungalow himself and bought a rickshaw, painted shiny white and covered with a new blanket. People are of course happy to ride it, plus he is strong and muscular, so business is booming. When he goes home to rest, he takes off his work clothes, puts on a fur coat, shiny leather shoes, and slicked-back hair. Those who don't know often mistake him for a big boss. He recently married a wife, who was originally an elementary school teacher. Because her monthly income could not make ends meet, she was willing to marry this rickshaw puller who earns more than 50,000 yuan a month.</p>
<h3>Also Talking About Old Ladies Turning into Men</h3>
<p>— Lu Shixiong</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Zheng Ji's article "An Old Lady Turning into a Man After Death" in the December 13th issue of this paper, in which the reasons for sexual change are not given a definite explanation, I will now provide a theoretical explanation as follows:</p>
<p>Generally, when a person is born, they have two adrenal glands on their kidneys. Initially, they are very large, occupying one-third of the kidney. As they get older, the adrenal glands shrink instead, with the normal size being one-thirteenth of the kidney.</p>
<p>The adrenal glands are specifically responsible for a person's sexual characteristics, and the two must be of equal size. If one of them suddenly enlarges, then this person will immediately undergo physiological changes. The so-called man turning into a woman, or a woman turning into a man, or having both sexes at the same time, all originate from the enlargement of the adrenal gland.</p>
<p>Chinese people often keep silent about sexual abnormalities, considering it very shameful, usually calling it "strange illness." We sometimes see in the news that the reason for disharmony in marriage and requests for divorce is due to only having the name of husband and wife. This is sexual change or abnormality, such as the common term "stone woman," which has been seen in ancient times. The *Tai Xuan Jing* says: "Wide without a son, a chamber of stone women." Su Dongpo's poem says: "A stone woman has no children, like barren valleys." Between husband and wife, if one party has sexual characteristics like a stone woman or hermaphrodite, not only is there no happiness in life, but there is also no hope for offspring.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of one thing having both sexes is not limited to humans, such as snails and earthworms in the animal kingdom, which are hermaphrodites. In the plant kingdom, such as hazelnuts, male and female flowers grow on the same plant.</p>
<p>The reason for a man turning into a woman or a woman turning into a man is due to one of the two adrenal glands enlarging, as mentioned above. Therefore, simply removing the enlarged one will immediately restore the sexual change. This matter has been clinically tested in British sexually transmitted disease hospitals several years ago and has been proven successful. However, only the enlarged adrenal gland can be removed. If both are removed at the same time, death will occur in less than two days.</p>
<p>The cause of sexual change was discovered by a British doctor, Dr. Broster. He studied the sexual changes in fish, and then progressed to the organization of human physiology, and obtained a definite treatment method.</p>
<p>As for the fact that Mr. Zheng Fan mentioned of "an old lady turning into a man after death," if it is not due to the sudden enlargement of the adrenal gland mentioned above, it is a case of male impersonating a woman and is close to a "hysterical" condition. The so-called "hysterical" is a type of mental illness. Those who suffer from this have a strange personality and are highly imitative. For example, she hopes to have a son, or pretends to be pregnant, or due to years of accumulated thinking, her stomach may even bulge, resembling an "imaginary pregnancy." Regarding "hysterical," a type of imitative mental illness, this theory comes from a medical doctor who studied the meaning of Latin, and he once told the author about it.</p>
<p>When we read about the sadness and pain of eunuchs in the unofficial histories of the palace, it is indeed an inhumane measure. In the rural areas of western Zhejiang, there is a practice of treating roosters in the same way as ancient eunuchs. It is said that after this procedure, the rooster becomes fat and tender.</p>
<p>Chinese people often avoid talking about sexual issues, and are ashamed to mention them. In fact, before the war, the American Sex Education Committee had already drafted nine articles of sexual education guidelines for middle schools, to be shared by parents, teachers, and doctors. European countries such as England and France have also included sex education in national teaching materials.</p>
<h3>Here and Now</h3>
<p>— Ganlai</p>
<p>Gas masks</p>
<p>Yesterday on Nanjing Road, vendors appeared selling American "gas masks," priced at 3,500 yuan each. I believe business must be good, because the New Year is approaching, and many people will definitely buy them as cheap toys for children. Very "profound significance"!</p>
<p>"Worthy of emulation?"</p>
<p>The Guangzhou municipal authorities, due to budget deficits, are reportedly preparing to charge citizens a "bridge toll" for crossing the Pearl River Iron Bridge daily, in order to make up for the deficit. The bridge was destroyed in the war and was only repaired after the victory. Taking from the people and using it for the people is more bearable than other "benevolent policies."</p>
<p>Shanghai's municipal funding has always been in a state of panic. Shanghai also has a Waibaidu Iron Bridge, which seems to have been repainted this summer. We could possibly...</p>
<p>The only exception</p>
<p>Amidst the massive dumping of cheap American goods, all industries in this city are affected, but there is one industry that has never been hit: "Trams remain as crowded as ever."</p>
<p>If the tram company takes back self-management and makes a public offering of shares, I will be the first to join.</p>
