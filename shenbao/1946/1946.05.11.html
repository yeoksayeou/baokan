<p>〔本報南京十日電〕三人小組委員會政府代表徐永昌，中共代表周恩來一行，於十日下午三時四十五分乘機離漢，五時四十七分抵京，在大校塲飛機塲降落，本報記者曾趨前請徐永昌將軍表示此行調查結果，徐調：「鄂中根本無戰事」，且連說三遍。並謂：渠等離漢前數小時，曾在漢簽訂公報，語畢，即乘車赴私邸休息。聞徐永昌將軍十日晚九時晋謁蔣主席，報告鄂中近情。記者旋請周恩來先生發表談話，周氏答稱：「伊等抵漢之第三天，即赴宣化店，因徐部長身體不適，由王學鳴代表前往，惟三人小組所到之處，已無戰爭狀態，語至此，周氏對昨日何總長在記者招待會席上發表鄂中共軍似欲目其原駐地向東擴展，伸入津浦南段一節，稍有聲辯，言畢，即驅車至梅園新村卅號寓邸休息。聞周氏今晚將訪晤馬歇爾特使，詳談此行經過。又調查鄂中實况之三人小組美代表白魯德將軍，於徐周抵機塲後一小時，乘機抵京，白氏下機後，即乘）早赴寗海路五號馬歇爾特使官邸報吿。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕徐永昌·周恩來·白魯德一行，自漢返京後，滿天風雲之鄂中衝突事件，候忽烟消霧散，眞相大白，根據周恩來之談話觀察，中共之前方與後方似已脫節，致弄出如此笑話消息，以觀最近共軍在蘇北之行動，當亦値一看。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕周恩來下機後曾言，渠甚願與政府代表赴蘇北一行，俾調查南通事件眞相。又據記者探悉，鄂中事件調查明白後，現尙有隴海甫路之通車問題，津浦·平漢各路之復路問題，蘇北共軍無故出擾之不幸事件，均須待中共作澈頭澈尾之檢討，如中共誠意謀和，政府可隨時派員陪周氏至各地視察。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口九日電〕周恩來·白魯德及徐永昌代表王學鳴等，九日下午由宣化店返抵漢，又漢口執行小組頃成立一附屬小組（亦名光山小組），政府代表爲陳謙上校，共黨代表爲任士舜中校，美方代表爲哈斯克上校，九日由漢抵達宣化店，將出發豫鄂邊區各處視察，隨行者有翻譯及電務員共十餘人。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十日電」軍事三人小組政府代表徐永昌，中共代表周恩來，美方代表白魯德，赴鄂調查軍事衝突，十日在漢獲致協議，並同時發致北平軍事調處執行部，武漢行營及中共中原軍區司令部。三人會議一致議決下列各項發致上述指揮機構，轉令長江以北各有關部隊實施之：（一）上述雙方指揮機構之指揮官，應即下達命令，制止本地區之小規模戰鬥及步哨衝突。（二）凡違反原停戰協定之部隊移動，應立即停止，但停戰命令中所規定允許之小部隊調動，如爲行政上之調動者，可繼續實施，惟應事前通知執行小組。（三）上述地區內，應立即停止新碉堡及永久工事之建造。（四）雙方指揮官應迅即於其司令部以及對峙部隊單位內，互派必要之連絡軍官，此項速絡軍官，應與執行小組取得連繫，以確定對峙部隊之界綫爲其主要任務之一。（五）同意運送中共軍傷病兵一千名，眷屬一百人及照顧與醫務人員共六十人，此項人員由中共中原軍區運至安陽，並定五月十五日爲起運日期，其詳細辦法應依照第九小組三方議定之手續行之，雙方應下達命令於各級指揮官，保證此項運輸不得遲延。（六）同意由雙方指揮官立即交換被拘人員名册，凡確定爲政治犯或戰俘，應於本年六月一日前釋放之。（七）同意保證中共軍爲整軍而復員人員，由中共中原軍區地區至其目的地途中及到達後之安全，但此項人員於復員還鄉之前，應由中共中原軍區造具名册，註明目的地及所經路綫，送交武漢行營，並保證此項人負確係還鄉，不携帶武器，並持有護照者。</p>
<p>本協定對北平軍調部過去之訓令及將三人小組關於本地區基本問題，或將獲致之協議，並無妨碍或影響。</p>
<p>上列文件係由政府代表徐永昌，中共代表周恩來，美方代表白魯德簽字，簽字時間爲民國卅五年五月十日下午三時，簽字地點在漢口楊森花園。又在簽字前，徐永昌將軍曾提出以下正式申明，目前華北，華中各已停戰地區所發生之小衝突及部隊調動，希望一律同樣停止，對於對峙狀態之各地區，亦應互派聯絡人員。關於被共軍圍困之地區，糧食之接濟，傷病兵之轉運，復員人員之安全保障，被俘人員之釋放諸問題，共方應如五月十日漢口協議之辦法，作同樣之解決」。美方代表白魯德，對此深表同意，中共代表周恩來亦表示在原則上大致贊同。</p>
<h3 id="c3">國防部長人選　陳誠呼聲較高 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕聞國防部定六月一日成立，部長人選現尙未定，但相信主持整編改組軍事七機關之陳誠將軍呼聲較高，完成受降遣俘大任之何總長應欽，將另任新職，暫時不能出國。</p>
<h3 id="c4">共軍呼應東北作戰　在華北積極活動　徐州小組視察隴海路東段被阻 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕此間官方解釋共軍近在華北各地所採取之積極行動謂，乃在呼應東北作戰，並且凖備一旦馬歇爾之調處無效，可立即以優異之態勢，出而控制國軍各據點，故近來除增兵東北外，並對華北各重要都市加強壓力，如賀龍所部一個師最近自張家口調來北平附近，津南共軍亦較前增加。唐山周圍共軍亦增加壓力圈，石家莊方面共軍已於四月廿七日由易縣調來一千四百人。此外，則將各　路綫兩旁之部隊逐漸移近鐵路，同機佔據軍站或將路軌破壞。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕共軍正加緊破壞北寗與津浦兩綫中，津浦路姚官屯以南電綫九日夜十時全被破壞，北寗路之北塘茶淀間，九日晚九時許有共軍五百餘人盤據，現尙未去，企圖不明，但該地　路並未破壞。楡關綏中段之五戶荒石問一六〇號鐵橋，八日被共軍破壞，於九日下午一時修復，但至昨夜十二時該橋又被破壞，他方前所與高嶺問之一七一號鐵橋，亦於今晨一時被共軍破壞，燒毁枕木七百餘根，現正搶修中，故甫告通車之錦楡段又吿不通。另悉，瀋陽，長春間客車通至開原，軍事列車可通至四平街南第一站蟒牛哨，該地一鐵橋被破壞，瀋陽至旅順客車可通大石橋，大石橋以南路綫已被澈底破壞。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕津浦綫泊頭被共軍於六日晚九時佔據後，泊顯小組下落不明，政府人員稱，共軍於攻守該站前，將該小組政府與美方代表誘至南皮，加以限制。中共方面謂，共軍之攻佔馮家口與泊頭，係因交河縣長徐春霞日前率保安隊攻擊共軍，共軍因而出以還擊，乃將該二地攻佔，至於執行小組之政府與美方代表，乃係於衝突前赴某地，因交通而被阻，至於是否在南皮，則未確言。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕官方消息，隴海東段大廟車站東一九八公里附近，已爲共軍破壞，徐州小組擬往視察，遭共軍隊開槍射擊，迫令停車，拒絕視察。張店博山鐵路於上月二十七日協議通車後，因有故又暫行停止。</p>

<p>〔聯合社瀋陽十日電〕東北保安司令杜聿明今日稱：東北國軍現取「待機」政策，一面集結部隊，以備對付四平街全面戰事。共軍已在四平街集中重兵，國軍現待南京方面談判能以成立何種協定，已往，共黨對於政治談判之態度，常以其軍事上之勝負爲轉移，共軍在本溪一役戰敗，或可使其態度更趨於妥治。杜氏謂，本溪一役，共軍被擊潰，國軍取得決定性之勝利，是役共軍投誠者五六千人，被俘者三千人，棄械潛逃者一萬人，惟共軍在本溪一帶者在十萬人以上。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十日電〕長春防守副司令劉德溥，業已脫惡，中央社前傳劉已於長春戰役中陣亡說不確。據長春來人談：上月十八日保安隊決定突圍後，本擬於長春南四十里之　春堡集合，惟屆期到達該處者，僅防守司令部王參謀長正國，崔高參志光，及兵士二。王崔等續行至鳳凰駝，始與劉副司令相遇，彼等遠繞西安西豐等地，經十日始到達國軍所在之雙廟子「開原南」，脫雖惡境。長春防守司令陳家珍，腿部中彈發炎，紅腫如木。陳與中共「民主聯軍」副司令呂正操係同鄉同學，呂與陳見面之第一句話爲；「早知是你，不用搶了。」共軍雖已進佔畏春多日，然對長春中央銀行滿藏銀票之保險櫃，仍無法開啓，該櫃爲全世界有數堅固保險櫃之一，堪與著名之英倫銀行保險比美。該櫃有鑰三把，必須連續使用，始能開啓，缺一不可。今三錀已如黃鶴，而普通刀斧之類，決不能將其開啓。破壞該椻之惟一方法，即爲用猛烈高溫度武器，如火箭砲之類，將其焚毀，但如此則櫃內銀票，亦將玉石俱焚矣。〔圖爲杜聿明將軍）</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕國軍縮編工作，刻正依照預定計劃，逐步付諸實施，本年度預計編餘軍官將達十萬人，倘與目前軍政部各軍官總隊所收訓之編餘及失業官佐合併計算，則應予復員之軍官，當在廿萬人左右。頃據記者自關係方面獲悉，在此廿萬編除軍官中，軍事當局決選拔優秀軍官一萬人，予以深造，儲爲新軍幹部，十五萬人則依其志願。專長，令入中央訓練團，接受轉業訓練，以便個別轉業。此外，三萬人將設法使之集團轉業，一萬人則依據海陸空軍官佐服役暫行條例處理，即停役滿三年而未回役者，免職。撤職。停職滿三年，而未任職者，考績連續三年不及格者，屆滿本官階停年三倍（平時四倍）不能晋任者，體質衰弱或病傷不堪服現役者，因補充及官額等事實之必要，而規定退役員額時，或成績居後者，將予以退役。處理各級軍官之逾現役限齡者，亦在退役之例。限齡之規定如次：一級上將爲六十二歲，二級上將（上將街）六十歲，中將五十六，少將五十二，上校四十六，中校四十四，少校四十二，土尉四十，中尉三十八，少尉三十六，准尉三十四。又各級軍官之逾服役限齡者，則將予以除役，其限齡規定爲上將六十七，中將六十五，少將六十，上校五十八，中校五十五，少校五十三，上尉五十，中尉四十七，少尉四十一。至軍政文職人員不合任官退役規定者，則予退職，處理各退役，除役軍官，除由政府發給還鄉旅費外，並可一次領取若干退役金。</p>

<p>— 張明</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕中華民國商會聯合會擴大籌備會議，開會六日，通過提案一百六十四件及大會章程草案等，於十日下午五時半宣吿閉幕，十一日晨全體代表遊覽京市名勝，由大會僱大汽車兩輛，供代表乘坐。</p>
<p>在全國若干地區陷在特殊狀况之下，一方面是糧食物資封鎖着，另一方面是飢餓災荒，流離失所，哀鴻遍野！在這種情形下產生的經濟形態，是不能避免一種危機的。於是，物價騰高，人們的生活遭受着無底的壓迫。鬥爭得最利害的，自然是勞資兩方面，在這個尖銳化的角度裏，在首都正在召開着一個全國性的商聯會擴大籌備會，該會是全國幾千乃至幾萬個有組織的公曾組合成的，今日這一個會的召集，無疑地對於中國經濟前途，具着一種重大的意義。</p>
<p>中國之有商會歷史，還是光緒廿七年的事。第一個是上海的商會，而全國商會聯合會也是在上海成立的。自「九一八」以還，東北諸省處在敵人之下，華北以至長江流域，亦因敵騎縱橫，商聯會無從召開大會。</p>
<p>在抗戰期中，初則以戰局沒有穩定，且工商界亦多流徙未定，沒有着手到組織上去。一直到前年六月六日，才在陪都成立了全國商聯會，但是爲了戰局關係，所以參加的單位，僅限於大後方諸省。這一次的大會，有東北的代表乃海外的代表參加，正象徵着國家的統一現象。但這次大會還不過是一個籌備會，却已經足够使我們興奮的了。</p>
<p>在大會開幕典禮上，擔任主席團主席的滬商界鉅子王曉籟曾說：「本會主旨乃在促進全國統一，精誠團結，並使經濟工業化，奠立穩定的基礎。」這簡簡短短的兩句話，可說是今後民生問題的最要着。我們要從輕工業，從手工業，從仰求外國原料的情形下蛻化爲高度化的工業國家。</p>
<p>在大會中，他們曾愼重地討論過有關國家命脈的對外貿易，以及如何發展並扶植民營事業。其外對於工商業的人事，對於從業員的保護和訓練，以及各種考察研究等積極性的案件，亦均曾一一提出討論。討論的案件，一共是一百四十六件。這次他們討論中心是政治重心從西南移轉到京滬後，西南今日的工商業狀况和未來的京滬工商之發展。</p>
<p>重慶市代表潘仰山先生，和記者談話時，記者問他：「政治經濟的重心移轉以後，重慶工商業近貌如何？你對於未來的展望怎樣？」他沉重的說：「從勝利以來一直到現在爲止，都是停滯在這種危險狀態中。爲了勝利，機關與個人都相　東下，（即便走不成也都在作返鄉打算）所以一切購買成了問題。成品沒有銷路，我們爲了要維持和我們共了八年艱苦的工人的生活，當然只得繼續開工。貨物一件件的堆積着，無人問津。貨物不能外銷，資金就不得流動。資金不能流動，勞資雙方都陷在可怕塌面中。因此，很多小型工廠，經不起這種巨浪侵襲、陸續倒閉了不少。後來經行政院經濟部及各有關機會的會商，決定由政府收購成品，收購生產工具，同時遣送工人還鄉。現在總算全部解決了。可是，工潮雖然解決而老闆在艱苦八年中得來機器也都賣去了。這何嘗是解決工潮的正營途徑。」潘先生是站在資方而同情勞方的立塲，發出了最深沉的歎息，這種歎息，乃鑒於經濟趨向崩潰而發的。</p>
<p>『他又　：「目前尙可勉强維持的是紡織業，他們還可以獲利。至於機器業與鋼鐵業，已全都倒閉子。紡織業雖然可以暫時維持，但是我們缺乏法動資金，不能存儲相當數量原料，所以即使可以賺錢，也沒有辦法盡量利用機器。何况將來美棉輸入，布疋內運，外貨價低，而我們成本增高之後，又如何與他們競爭？因此結果還逃不了崩潰的一途。」</p>
<p>上海市代表王曉籟先生，這麽對記者說：「我覺得切力量基於組織，即使是經濟，也是基於組織。比方說：日本人是不管有沒有原料，還是要想法獨霸市塲。反之，猶太人有了原料，有了錢，有了人，也還是沒有辦法。所以，組織的力量是相當重要的。八年來，中國的工商業已做到了「堅苦」的地步了，但是目前怎樣來處　呢？唯一的要圖在振興工廠。上海是一個對外貿易的集中站，也是一個消費的塲所。就全國來說，要發展工業，最好就出產地辦理，並且要就人工與水源能取得種種便利。這樣，我們的經濟才能眞正的工業化起來。」天津代表羅宗强先生吿訴記者關於天津的工商業近况。他說：天津市共轄有一百六十一個同業公會，擁有一七九六個工廠，但現在只有一千二百四十個廠是開工的，其餘五百五十五個在停頓中。其中國營一百三十四個，商營者爲一千六百四十二個，不明者二十個。性質是以棉織的最多，的五百餘家，金屬的一百五十餘，化學工業二百左右，食品工業一百多，建築業二十五，其他日用品二百餘家。目前問題的癥結，乃全在治安與交通能吾解決，而共軍到處破壞，而且原料又有一部份必須仰給國外。失業工人最多時達十餘萬人，經一度救濟後，現尙有三萬餘人。工資每月的在六萬至十萬元左右，唯工潮仍時常發生着。」</p>
<p>南京代表王繹齊光生說：對於振興南京工業，首先應將原有手工業輕工業加以整頓。現在政府已劃燕子磯一帶爲工業區，目前已有東下工廠，卅餘家來京登記。一般的仍以棉織居多，化學次之。唯紙廠及油廠亦在計劃中。目前就業工人的有六七萬人，失業工人爲三萬人左右。其待遇略次於滬，的五萬至八萬元之間。台灣代表林熊徵先生自台灣來，他說台灣出產糖·米·木材·茶葉·樟腦等，有一百多家工廠，以糖業最盛，輸出亦以此爲大宗，不過略有限制，缺乏的則以棉布與肥料爲最甚。」</p>
<p>出席這次全國商聯曾籌備會的代表，會畢後，分回各地，將努力加強組織，期能於秋後召開全國商聯會之正式大會。這種組織的力量，無疑地將使中國工商各業入於健全發展之境，未來的國家經濟基礎，也可因此而日趨鞏固。</p>

<p>犯罪事實</p>
<p>被告梁鴻志，在北京政府時代，迭任國務院參事，北京衛戍司令部秘書長，參議院議員，執政府秘書長等職。國府建都南京後，息影杭縣，民國廿六年八月，抗戰初興，移居來滬，迨京滬相繼失守，國府西遷，遂起意通敵叛國，與敵軍原田少將等結納，籌建華中淪陷地區之傀儡政權，於廿七年三月廿八日，在南京正式成立僞「維新政府」，該偽政府下設兩院八部，被吿自任僞行政院院長，以首魁地位，總覽全權，發號施令，主特該僞府院部首長之政治會議，改用五色國旗，召凜軍隊，爲敵寇鞏固後防，以武力接收設於租界內之江海關，攫奪中央關稅，並陸續與敵酋簽定鐵路·電信·鹽務·銀行等協定，組織華中鐵道公司，華中電氣通信公司，華中水電公司，華中鹽業公司，與敵合作，經營合組華興銀行，發行紙幣，流通市上，擾亂金融，合組中華輪船公司及核准內河輸船公司之設立，卑敵人得在內河航行無阻。又設立戒烟局，專辦公賣，運輪鴉片烟土，登記烟民等車務，助敵實施毒化政策，徵收鴉片及其他稅款，爲偽政府開闢財政來源。又該偽「維新政府」成立未久，被吿曾與華北偽「臨時政府」主席王逆克敏會商合併，經數度協議，卒於民國廿七年九月，在北平成立僞「中華政府聯合委員會」，被吿兼任委員，該僞委員會在平·京·靑島等處，先後開會數次，並發表及鼓動所謂停戰救國，反抗中央等荒謬言論及行動。在民國廿八年四月五日，汪逆兆銘背叛黨國，潛來上海，籌組僞「國民政府」，被告與王逆鑒於汪逆獲有敵酋奧援，而本身之聲勢漸衰，經與會商後，即於同年九月廿一日及甘三日，先後由僞「中華政府聯合委員會」及「　　」「臨時」兩傀儡政權發表宜言，響應汪逆之和平運動，次年一月廿三日，被吿與汪王二逆會於靑鳥，共同決定組織中央政治會議，三月廿日即在南京舉行商定僞「國民政府」樹立大綱，僞中央政治委員會及舉北政務委員會組織條例，並發表僞「國民政府」各院部長人選，同月三十日，實現所號稱之「國肘還都」，發表荒謬之還都宣言及僞「國民政府」政綱，而僞「中華政府聯合委員會」，「維新政府」，「臨時政府」同時宣告解散，被告改任偽中央政治委員會委員，兼僞監察院院長。至三十三年十一月二十日，偽立法院院長陳逆公博，因汪逆死亡，繼任偽國民政府主席，兼行政院院長，被吿遂接充偽立法院院長，直至抗戰勝利爲止，茲經軍事委員會調查統計局上海辦事處解送本處，依法偵查。</p>
<p>起訴理由</p>
<p>本件被告對於如何自民國廿七年二月起籌組僞「維新政府」，自任僞行政院院長，總攬大權，並與偽「臨時政府」主席王逆克敏會商合併，成立偽「中華政府聯合委員會」，兼任委員，迨在逆成立偽「國民政府」，又任僞中央政治委員會委員，監察院院長，立法院院長等職，直至抗戰勝利爲止，各節業據在偵查中自白不諱。核與在重事委員會調查統計局上海辦事處之供述相符，並有其親筆自白書及歷年新聞報紙，申報年鑑，新中國手册等件之時事記載可證，事實極爲明顯。查被吿原係著名親日之安福系政客，抗戰初期，因見我軍事失利，王逆克敏已在北平組織僞「臨時政府」，乃起而效尤，決意通敵叛國，送於敵軍　力倘領之華中淪陷地區內，樹立僞「維新政府」，竊據首都，信行政令，改換國旗，召募軍隊，與中央呈對時局面，助長敵寒侵略兇燄，動搖軍民抗戰意志，其爲通謀敵國，反抗本國，情節昭然。至被吿於僞「維新政府」首長時期，執握大權，推行僞政，建立僞軍，在南京·蘇州·杭州·蚱埠設立四軍管區，實施綏靖工作，顯係輔翼敵軍，鞏固防務，制止我游擊部隊之活動，其妨害抗戰至深且鉅。至與敵成立各種協定，合資創設華中鐵道公司，華中電氣通信公司，華中水電公司，同屬假與敵合辦之名，將各項公用交通等重要事業界於敵手，而所合組華中鹽業公司及華興銀行，又係對民生必需之食鹽統制運銷及發行僞華興券，擾亂金融之機構。設立戒烟局，辦理鴉片公賣，運輸烟土，無菲助敵推行毒化人民，危害種族之政策。攫取江海關，截收關稅，亦屬以暴力妨害我關務官署行使職權。此外，復與敵合組山華輪船公司，並核准內河輪船公司設立，承認敵內河航行權，徵收鴉片及各項稅賦，以橫徵暴歛，搜括民脂，爲僞政府開闢財源之方法。以上各端，無一非喪權利敵，禍國殃民之措施，被吿對於通敵叛國，動機雖辯稱激於悲天憫人之感情衝動，故入地獄救衆生，然姑無論偽「維新政府」成立以後，種種措施，有如前述，即毫無裨益民衆可言，且查敵軍入寇，抗戰初興，舉國上下正敵愾同仇，被吿竟以國家禦侮圖存之戰爭，視爲個人進取利祿之機遇，不惜認賊作父，供敵利用，於淪陷區內，建傀儡政權，推行僞政，反抗中央，幾使國家民族陷於萬刦不復之境地，喪心病狂，莫此爲甚。即被告自白書中，亦自承「對於國家立塲，未經兼顧，此自是商人之　　糊塗，不能辭免罪責」，何能任其飾詞駁卸。再被告於僞維新政府成立未久，即謀與筆北「臨時政府」合併，顯係仰承敵寇意旨，促成僞政權之統一團結，而加強反抗中央之力量，嗣汪逆通敵叛國，發表艷電，籌組僞「國民政府」獲敵支持，被吿知勢無可抗，乃與沆滙一氣，不特發表宜言以爲響應，且與之協力，籌備策細，以底於成。迨僞「國民政府」成立，「維新政府」解散以後，猶復熱中戀棧，參加僞「國民政府」，先後充任僞監察院院長及僞立法院院長，其時雖以非復首魁，汪逆文未寄以腹心，致使不能單獨有所作爲，然旣屬僞組織中樞要員，又兼僞政府最高政治指導機關，決定施政，軍事，外交大計之僞中央政治委員會委員，其對於曾經副署之民國卅二年一月九日對我盟邦英美宣戰布吿　　九年十一月卅日簽訂中日　本　係條約，發表中白滿共同宣言，承認僞滿洲國，卅二年十月卅日簽訂中日同盟條約等項，自亦應負共同責任。按被告在抗戰初起，即領導組織傀儡政權，嗣僞組織蜼經更易，而被吿始終參與其間，歷任要職，其罔顯國家利害及民族生存，悍然通敵叛國，洵屬巨奸大愗，衡情無可矜全，應請從重處斷，以正民氣，而伸國法。</p>
<p>綜上所述，被告實有懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款，通謀敵國，圖謀又抗本國罪嫌，合依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條第一項，第二項，刑事訴訟法第二百三十條第一項提起公訴，請即依法審判，上海高等法院檢察官戴榮鐸。</p>

<p>本月七日英國首相艾德禮宣布英國決定將所有駐埃英國海陸空軍全部撤離埃及，與埃及進行談判。自英政府作此決定後，反對黨的領袖邱吉爾及艾登即在國會席上對英政府的埃及政策加以抨擊。邱吉爾見英國近百年來，特別是近六十年來在埃及的經營即將傾毁，緬懷過去大英帝國的光榮，且今世界局勢的未能安定，對於英政府之有是項決定，自然不勝感慨，唏噓低迴，來能自己。但英國政府對埃及的新決定，終於得到國會的支持，因爲英國國會的席次，政府的工黨擁有絕對多數，反對黨不過呌出反對的呼聲，初不能動搖政府的旣定決策。邱氏在國會的演說，側重六十年來英國對埃及的經營，煞費苦心，不能將前人的經營毁於一旦，况埃及蘇彝士運河，爲英帝國交通綫的關鍵，尤應駐兵防守，以確保帝國交通。又謂埃及握歐亞非澳之樞紐，英國如果撤離埃及，必影響到它的整個戰略計劃。但艾德禮則謂英政府之作是項決定，曾徵詢海陸空軍首長及各自治領首長的意見，詢謀僉同，纔有此項決定。現在英國會對政府的埃及政策旣予支持，英埃談判又在進行，則英國駐屯埃及全部海陸空軍即將開始撤離，爲期當不在遠，惟全部駐軍的撤盡，或須經過一個較長的時期。</p>
<p>英國對埃及之有這一新決定，當然是極明智的。埃及民族情緒的激昂，迫使英國不得不採取這斷然的決定。一個具有民族意織的國家是不容許有外國軍隊駐屯於它的領土以內的。與其因駐軍而招致反英的情緒，反使埃及運河的防衛招致困難，自不如自動撤退駐軍以贏得人的好感爲得計。六十年前英國派軍進據埃及，是爲了英國的利益；今日英軍的撤離埃及，亦是爲了英國的利益。英國執政的工黨，雖其政策比較左傾，但他們都是英國人，先英國人而後纔工黨黨員，故凡有措施，終能以民族利益爲上。就英國的立塲論，撤退駐埃英軍旣以滿足埃及的民族願望，對英國自身亦爲有利的事。這一政策運用的巧妙，舊式的「帝國建造者」或「維多利亞時代」的人物如邱吉爾者，或尙不知其底。「和平的深人」不是這一時代的特徵嗎？</p>
<p>値得注意的是由於英軍的撤離埃及所引起的戰略關係的演變。其實，話或再應該這樣說，英軍的撤離埃及是由於這次世界大戰的經騐而得到的戰略關係演變的結果，觀乎英首相艾德禮的宣布，英政府之作是項決定，曾徵詢過海陸空軍參謀總長的意向而得其同意，可知英國之撤離駐埃英軍，原也是一種新戰略的決定。由於空運部隊的使用，空軍力量的發展，畏程轟炸的可能，以及柏林和羅馬軸心威脅的消滅，埃及的戰路價値今非昔比。此際而有駐埃英軍之撤離，一方面旣可滿足埃及人民的願望，在英國亦可有戰略上的新安排。的確，英國費了六十四年而經營亞歷山大海軍港，原爲英國海軍地中海艦隊的重要據點；英軍撤離埃及，必將放棄這個重要的軍港。由於這一次大戰的經騐，海軍戰略有了根本的改變。傳統的海軍戰略已不再適用。現代海軍的作戰，已超離必須有海軍根據地的傳統條件。這次大戰中，美國海軍在太平洋的作戰，就是顯明的例子。南非，東非，以及錫蘭，近東都可能爲此後英國的軍事根據地，負起防衛蘇彝士運河的任務。英軍的撤離埃及，決不是它對保衛蘇　士運河責任的放棄，而是對保衛運河採取了一種新的戰略決定。英埃現在進行的談判，包括有運河區域的防衛事項，可知英國並不曾放鬆過它對於該區域的防衛責任。</p>
<p>我們於此重有所感的是常英國決定撤離駐埃英軍，承認外的但獨立的時候，蘇聯却要求接管意屬北非及東非。這在政策上是極有趣的對照。意屬北非人民的智識水準是相當高的，原曾受過古羅馬文化的薰陶；其後又受過　拉森文化的影響，當蘇聯在各處「扶植」民族運動之際，而主張它自己來接管意屬北非，雖或爲外交上的一種手段，未必能達到眞正接管的目的，然其注意北非與東非，不難想見。埃及因英軍的撤離而得到完全的獨立，但自讓爲「伊斯蘭敎的保護者」的，怕未必因墨索里尼的死亡而繼起無人。目今世界的趨勢，小國的生存隨時有仰承大國鼻息的可能；埃及固然完全獨立了，滿足了他們累世的民族願望，此後埃及在這紛擾的世界中何以自處，實在關係世界的持久和平。我們希望埃及要珍重他們勝利的果實。對於英國，這一新決定所象徵的，不是英國的沒落而是英國的新生。國與國間的關係，要築在信愛的基礎上　能持久。「帝國」「征服」的時代是過去了，已是一個新的時代！英國政府能把握住這個新時代的精神，而有新的政策決定，儘管邱吉爾　看不順眼，但無論如何，是明智的。</p>

<h3 id="c24">四國外長意見距離太遠　昨會議又無結束　蘇聯堅決反對召開和會 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十日廣播：蘇聯拒絕參與發起召集和平會議工作後，四強外長今日復舉行會議，企圖獲取妥協辦法，但無結果，定明晨舉行非正式會議。在今晨會議中，英外相貝文會與莫洛托夫發生齟齬，具文告莫洛托夫曰：「反對召開和平會議，不特即係否決和平會議，且係否決一切參戰國發言之權利，對於此種行爲，本人絕對不能同意」。法外長當時會提出妥協辦法，主張和平會議延期，四強外長可於下月十五日（即貝爾納斯建議和會舉行日期）舉行集　，再度努力，擬定和約，然後再行決定召開和會日期。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十日電〕四國外長會議非但對歐洲新和約條件，竟見醫納，且對召開二十一國和平會議，以討論和約條件問題，亦各持意見，致會議阻礙重重。一般人士今日預料各代表將作最後努力，期使蘇美雙方對召開和會事，泯除異見，惟多數觀察家均以爲難獲協議，而各外長將於下週初各返本國。各代表私下亦承認有數項基本問題，蘇聯與西方列強間意見懸殊，欲求融和，絕少希　。昨日會議時，美國務卿貝爾納斯與蘇外長莫洛托夫因美方提議六月十五日召開和會事，爭辯兩小時之久，莫洛托夫主張四國應先商妥和約，然後召開和會，美代表反對甚力，雙方意見，更相逕庭，遂告休會。英方人士今日稱：莫洛托夫已責美國違背莫斯科三國協定，因當時英·美·蘇·三國曾決議各外長先須擬定和約，然後提付和會，而和會須於草約業已擬定，等候考量時，始行召開。同時，參與會議人士披露，蘇聯要求分得義國兩艘新戰艦之一，英美已加拒絕。聞此事係對養和約有關海軍條款內數要點之一，四國海軍專家商議有關海軍條款，亦已近僵局。</p>

<p>目前金融界對地方事業，均無意投資，胡氏稱。主要原因，乃因國家政治問題，致幣值降似，投資後非但無利潤可得，且易虧蝕，則非普通民營銀行所能負擔。故游資寗作投機事業貸款取息。又如公務員之待遇菲薄，無從維持生活，此亦為國家整個問善。故當此國家不安定待期，身為公務員者，祗能緊束腰帶，淸苦自持，共同渡此艱難。</p>

<p>劉庭長詢問年齡，籍貫，家庭人口，財產後，則問︰「你加入過國民黨嗎？」答：「沒有。」嗣由檢察官宣讀起訴擺畢，由蔡逆即供述，參加偽府乃係汪逆精衛之强加圈套，被拉為工商部次長，決非「廿心附逆。」其在偽南京市市長任內，曾整理總理陵墓，救濟艱民不作；太平洋戰爭發生後，日軍在京强拉民伕，亦經之之力手，始得倖免。其長偽糧食管理會時，曾歌撤减軍米，抵制日本，因不得逞，乃調至上海，担任掛名差使，閉門思過。至於彼之充任偽駐日大使，原不欲行，因得中央徐明誠之指示，乃「深入虎穴，刺探敵情。」在東京之行動，未得完全自由，似被視為間諜，故即回國辭職。</p>

<p>— 本報杭州七日通訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>我們從上海出發到杭州，不論坐火車汽車和輪船等，都可以看見兩旁的桑林，尤其在仲春天氣，桑葉繁茂，靑葱可愛，再從杭州乘杭江鐵路，或是坐浙贛路車經諸曁蕭山等處，也可以看見一排之整齊的桑樹。如果到餘杭，那更是滿野桑林了。這是著名的浙江絲的產地，那裏差不多農家都以養蠶爲業，即使是城市裏的人家，也養一兩張蠶種，來卜今年的財運。</p>
<p>正是蠶絲抬頭良機</p>
<p>以往，浙江的絲傾銷國外，後來日太迎頭趕上，改良桑樹，改良蠶種，改良育蠶，改良烘繭。世界絲的市塲，就被日本奪去。現在日本正忙於國內的整理，正是我們蠶絲抬頭的時候，猶憶我們在大後方研究一些榨蠶（野蠶），到現在還是沒有多大的成效，今失土已復，强敵已去，我們再不謀發展，等到什麽時候去呢？</p>
<p>根據民國二十二年實業部國際貿易局中國實業誌浙江誌的調查統計，在錢江以北，太湖之南舊杭嘉湖地區屬，以全省計：　桑面橫爲二百六十五萬八千一百九十三畝，年產桑一千八百三十六萬六千四百十担，育蠶戶八十萬零四千三百五十二家，年產改良種繭三十二萬六千四百担，土種繭七十六萬一千六百担，廠絲五千零八十担，土絲八萬五千二百六十担，綢類三十萬疋。這個數字是很可觀的，現在，我們如果好好經營，一定有很多的辦法。不過找們當前所要注意到的問題，就是蠶戶以高利貸來育蠶，結果蠶戶還是窮根見底。土種多於改良種，土種的出路與處理的辦法，還是需要解決。</p>
<p>中蠶公司輔導蠶絲</p>
<p>據國營的中國蠶絲公司浙江分公司的負責人吿記者。他們絕對不奪民之利，也不與民爭權，他們是輔導蠶絲事業之發展的。三十萬張改良種，已經由他們配給建設廳的浙江蠶業改良委員會，再由改良委員會配給各縣的蠶業改良所，再配給到各鄉的蠶業改良組織，然後分配到農民的身上。聽說今年的改良抓價錢高到一萬二千元一張，但中蠶配給的僅二千元，如果眞正農民能够如價貸到，倒是一件値得高興的事。據記者獲悉：合作事業管理處，他們負責貸放的改良蠶種北只嘉興，崇德，海寗，諸蠶，蕭山，杭縣，德淸等七縣，因爲這七縣的合作組織健全，可以直接貸放到人民的身上。然而海寗的海塘搶險委會主任委員顧達一，就抓到一個抬高改良蠶種價格售與農胞的人。所以其他各縣是否眞正能够仍以二千元貸給農胞，這還待眞能深入農村工作的人去考察。記者曾問過中蠶公司的浙江負責人，他對於蠶種是否會加價發售，也說不能負責担保。</p>
<p>蠶戶受不了高利貸</p>
<p>改良種貸得後，是要馬上交二千元代價的，其他尙有一筆育蠶的貸款，每一戶有三千元，由農民銀行直接貸放的。戰前浙江的改良與土種蠶種，總在一百萬張以上，現在姑算他打一七折，則也當有七十萬張，除了三十萬張的改良種外，還有四十萬張的土種。國營中蠶公司對土種的蠶絲，因爲外銷不够標準，所以任其自然，也不貸款，也不指導，則三十二萬一千七百三十二家蠶戶，是否會受高利貸的剝削，這是一個當前的問題。</p>
<p>土絲廠家故弄玄虛</p>
<p>季節已經到了「立夏」，「立夏三日出新絲」，這是蠶家一句成語，那麽土種的蠶絲就要應市，而改良種較遲，聽說要到本月十五以後才能上山作繭。中蠶公司他用政治的力量禁止沒有絲廠開繭行的，可以說是防免居間餘繭商的轉嫁剝削，這是對的。並且浙分公司已談定二萬萬元借款與絲廠家設繭行收繭，最近消息上海銀行團又有二百萬萬元貸款與蘇浙閩三省收繭。但是中蠶公司以要改良種的繭，不要土種的繭，因此這許多貸款亦貸在專收改良種繭的絲廠繭行家。而土種的蠶戶，都找不到脫售蠶繭的塲所，過去有許多餘繭商辦的繭行，他可以收，現在餘繭商取銷了，偶有少數絲廠收取，則價格亦必不致甚高，而旣沒有獲着改良蠶種，又沒有獲着育蠶貸款的土種蠶戶，將何以自處？記者曾爲此事訊及浙蠶公司負責人。他說：不必爲他們着急，他們自有辦法。過去土蘭每百兩曾跌至五萬萬元，現在已升至九萬元，但這是土絲廠家的故弄玄虛，以逗引農家來賣，一俟求售多了，又要慘跌，農胞們總會上這個當的。我認爲眼看這大多數的蠶戶上當吃虧，終究也不是善策。</p>
<p>免除土絲蠶戶痛苦</p>
<p>絲廠繭行收繭後繅絲，可委中蠶公司售於國外，如不經中蠶公司也可，惟事前須將蠶絲爲該公司鑑定，現在改良種蠶絲外銷市塲，每磅已賣到美金十二元五角，當然要比土絲强得多了。土絲的出路，當然貝有織綢，戰前綢段都行　東北與南洋，現在東北在混亂中，南洋還沒有大定，土絲的出路，只有織綢賤賣，由於綢廉，所以土絲　的價格定會下降的。</p>
<p>中蠶公司又在嘉興所屬與轟杭綫上成立了一個示範區，培育桑樹，養蠶，烘繭，繅絲等。合作事業管理處亦在嘉與等地舉辦合作烘蘭。不過這許多事業頂好要號召土種蠶戶多多的參觀學習，同時，要大量的生產改良種蠶種，始可免土種蠶戶　受痛苦。</p>
<p>〔蠶寳寶〕大眠的大眠了，上山的上山了，快要大眠的也要大眠了，我們不願在齊脚平等的農胞中，有「洋寶寶」「土寳賽」之不同，我們願意看到「土賓寶」也受到改良的實惠。</p>
<h3 id="c115">英國現階段　生活情調 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>英倫上空的戰雲雖然消散了已經有一年，但是英國人覺得和平的日子依然是很艱難的，在某些方面甚至比以前更艱難。戰時配給食牧少，衣服破舊，房屋缺乏，生活上的限制多，人民倒也安之若素，但是目前的緊張情形，却使向來以忍耐聞名於世的英國人，也似乎有些暴躁了。</p>
<p>猶如其他的歐洲國家一樣，英國的最難解決的問題，就是食物和房屋。勞工政府自從去年夏天執政以來，曾經遭遇到種種難題，但是截止目前最不討好的一件事，就是不久以前爲了全世界糧食的短少，而不得不把本米已經不大　裕的食物配給再度予以縮减，這一個突如其來的消息，似乎把英國的主婦們震動透不過氣來。</p>
<p>鷄蛋粉缺貨　臉孔陰沉下來</p>
<p>當史密斯爵士宣宣佈市塲上不再右鷄蛋粉的一個早晨，街路上來來往往的行人都普最遍地掛着一副陰沉的面孔，令人想起戰時前綫消息不大順利的日子。我們記得這個消息公佈的時候，安全理事會中，正在激烈辯論英軍留駐希臘的問題，但是十家報紙中倒有九家注意雞蛋粉的消息，有如注意貝文和維辛斯基的大辯論一樣。糧食部雖然大講其沒有雞蛋的蛋糕和布了像有雞蛋的一樣好，就是請母雞來辨別也分不出好壞來，但在鮮雞蛋和駝鳥蛋一樣名貴的情形之下，沒有一個婦人肯相信雞蛋粉的缺貨，不是一種重大的不幸的。</p>
<p>雖然大多數人都希望和平可以把緊束了好久的腰帶放寬一下，但在現在他們已經確信這條腰帶必須比以前還要抽得緊些。麵包也有發生問題的危險，食物店中准得像小丘一樣的不受配給限制的麵包，已經看不見。每一個廚房必須儘量的節省，有如在德國潛水艇出沒於英國港口的時候一樣。</p>
<p>各種配給品　均呈減退趨勢</p>
<p>全部的脂肪配給，包括白塔，麥淇淋和猪油在內，每星期已減至七盎司，而對於食糖的供應，政府已經流露出不祥的暗示。肉類的配給，依然是每星期一先令兩辨士，（不到美金二角五分），其中七分之一必須領取罐頭鹹牛肉。茶葉的配給是兩盎司半，比一九四四年十一月祗多了半盎司。另一方面，醃肉的配給在一九四四年緊急時期，是每星期六盎司，現在倒祗有三盎司了。就是購買罐頭食物，乾果，果汁，雜糧等雜物的分數，也已經從每月廿四分減至二十分。根據記分的辦法，一罐果汁就要十六分，一罐肉類就要十六至廿四分，那麼家庭中，選擇少許奢侈品的因難情形，就不難想見了。現實的狀况和英國人所想像的吸着板烟斗享受和平之福的境界，相差得太遠。據最近化學分析的結果，英國人在一九四四年每天所得到的食物熱量是二九二三卡羅里，而一九四五年倒祗有二七五〇卡羅里了。</p>
<p>食物太單調　每頓都差不多</p>
<p>英國比其他許多歐洲國家幸運一點，人民所得到的食物，足以維持生命，但是食品的異常單調，殿粉成分的過多，鮮果和甜品的缺乏，使人民開始感到不耐。在酒館中，不論你出怎樣高的代似，這一頓飯和上一頓飯，細覺得有「差不多」之感。在價格較廉也地方，榮單上菜名非常之多，但是實際上，都不過是麵包來香腸之類的老調，祇是名稱上好聽些罷了。</p>
<p>倫敦菜館中的菜單更其富麗堂皇，外表也弄得夠美觀，但是吃起來，却乏味得很。冷盆中大都是切碎的蔬菜，有時也可能有烤肉，但是在你光顧的時候，往往已經從菜單上劃掉了。</p>
<p>對於不能到外邊去吃東西的人，問題更其要困難得多。單靠配給食品過活的老年人，幾乎有迫近飢俄綫的危險。英國婦女都苦於沒有東西放在掉上，供給嗷嗷待哺的家庭一日三餐。</p>
<p>買魚須排隊　等得令人焦躁</p>
<p>吃魚是一種解決的辦法，但是要買魚，就得排隊，等上好許多時候，令人心焦。在主婦們看夾，今日的牛和羊生來都沒有肝和腎似的，因爲在肉舖裏不容易看到它們的踪跡。雞和任何一種家禽是買不到的。去年英國蘋果的收成不好，秋季以來，水果店裏沒有鮮果，偶然有一點橘子，但是買起來要扣配給分數，此外祇有最近到過的一小批香蕉了。英國人看到了多年不見的香蕉時的那種驚喜的情形，可見他們對於日常食物的單調所感覺到的厭倦程度。母親們從小菜店中買了香蕉出來，總是容光煥發，彷彿是自己從香蕉樹上摘下來的一樣。</p>
<p>房屋辦法處　擠滿覓屋人口</p>
<p>倫敦人除了相心食物之外，另一件担心的事情就是房屋。在倫敦有如在英國其他被炸的城市一樣，要找一間房屋來避避風雨，實在是非常棘手的問題。</p>
<p>據負責房屋問題的官吏講，現在的情形比德國人實行閃電空襲的時候還要壞。因爲在局勢緊張的時候，民衆大部份都疏散到鄉下去，入伍的人都到別地方去了，所以睡覺的地方總是有的。現在疏散的人回來了，小孩子也回來了，避難所已經關閉了，軍隊的復員雖然可增加建築工人的數目，但是申請房屋者的行列也每天在增加，活動房屋固然也有，可是在普遍的崖荒形勢中，祇是滄海一票而已。</p>
<p>例如在倫敦窮苦的康貝成爾區，在全區七萬五千所房屋中，未遭轟炸而金甌無缺的祇有四百所。在當地的各房屋辦事處裏，每天總有許多人坐着，等待和負責人會面，希望得到一個容身之所</p>
<p>小康的家庭　佈置依然陳舊</p>
<p>許多小康的英國家庭，佈置還是陳萬得很，沒有多大辦法可以裝飾得更美觀。修理房屋的費用，最高限度依然是一百鎊（等於美金四百元多一點，）如非絕對必要的侈理，才可以得到額外的數目。在初春的陽光之下，倫敦看上去還是很破舊的樣子。室內的情形也差不多，無論棉織品或者毛織品，都是配給的。沒有一個女子可以有辦法替她的沙發換上一套春季的新裝。食櫃之類上面的細蔴布裝飾品，在大多數的家庭中已經是補了再補，修了再修。浴巾新的時候原是很大的，現在已經剪得像手帕那麼一塊了。瓷器的問題比較容易解決，但是品質刦談不上，大多數都是素色的笨重的東西，上繪大紅色玫瑰花的斯丹福特郡瓷器，斯巴特的茶具，以及靑花白地的威奇馬特瓷器，都是英國的名產，但是現在，祇供出口之用，藉以减輕國庫的支絀。</p>
<p>婦女們所少不了的美麗的帽子，並不受配給的限制，但是她們最感困難的是內衣，襪十，和鞋子。買鞋子更其不容易，鞋店的樹窗雖然有不少存貨，但是細細一看，下面却放着一張小牌子：「此係樣品，恕不出售。」偶然鞋店裏有一批貨色出售，但是一下子就被排隊的女子買光了。戰前英國的皮件是很有名的，但是目前國內市塲上的貨色都很差，鞋店大多改營修理皮鞋。母親們最感頭痛的，就是小孩的鞋子子，買旣不容易買到，假如出價低一點，有時候就買到油布和硬紙板做的東西，穿不多久就破了。</p>
<p>一天好一天　國民信念彌堅</p>
<p>英國一般的生活，如此困難而嚴肅，所以限制方面稍爲寬了一點，這就對於民衆的精神有良好的影響。現在，主婦們可以購買品質優良的煎盤了，木梳雖非從黑市的小販手中不能買到，但是指甲油可以在店中買到了。據說戰時對於婦女服飾上的限制，不久也可以取消。衣袋，鈕扣，和褶襇等等又可以自由翻新花樣了。對於受苦已久的英國民衆，這一類戰時限制的减輕，當然是感激不盡的。</p>
<p>在和平時代英國的一般家處中，生活雖不見得輕鬆，却很穩定。艱難的事情固然很多，但是他們都知道情形是會一天比一天好轉的。在過去，英國人對於英倫之戰的勝利曾抱絕對的信念，這一次，他們的信念也還是一樣堅定。（譯自四月號柯里亞雜誌）</p>
<p>人造橡皮車胎</p>
<p>一種新的人造橡皮車胎，據說和天然橡皮軍胎一樣好。它是從政府的特種。CR-S-10人造橡皮製成的。這裏使橡皮成乳漿的東西不是脂肪酸而是樹脂，這是很重要的因素，它使車胎可以耐久，轉動時溫度不易升高，和有更大的力量足以減少車輪的隆隆聲。</p>
<p>另外一個因素晨車胎形式的設計，它接觸地面的部份比一般車胎大，這使它更平穩地在路上滾動。這是一個很大的進步。接觸面的加多可以使車身更平穩，重量的分配更平均，減少接觸面的拖曳力。（美國新聞處）</p>
<h3 id="c116">恢復民政後展開新問題　改組香港政制 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 本報香港七時航訊　林友蘭</p>
<p>倫敦一日路透電：據此間今日宣佈，英屬殖民地香港之制度，將儘速以更多之自由爲基礎，加以修正。英政府現正攷慮方法，使香港居民，一如其他殖民地之情形，對於審理其本身之事務上，可以担任更重要之任務。英政府業已訓令香港總督，徵詢社會各階層之意見，對此整個問題，加以研究，並至遲於本年年底以前，早日提出報告。</p>
<p>就在倫敦拍出上述的電訊的同日，香港正式恢復自一九四一年聖誔節後巾斷了的民政。新任港督楊慕琦從英倫飛抵香港。一日上午十時，在督轅內舉行就職典禮，前任香港軍政府總督夏慤中將宣讀撤銷軍政府的第一號公報，下旗而去。記者在過去的通訊中，曾繩報道遍香港恢復民政前夕的情勢及新任港督楊慕琦的略歷，現在想趁此機會，談談改組香港政制的問題。</p>
<p>新任港督楊慕琦　發表港自治計劃</p>
<p>楊慕琦在他的就職典禮的演說中，亦有提及「發展香港人民自治的計劃」，並說：「本督敢調此」通吿，足令全港人士心滿意足」。這是楊慕琦「歷嘗日軍手下苦痛之囚禁生活後」（見夏感中將致詞）帶給香港人民的「禮物」，也是他的行政錦囊中的第一籌。無怪宣佈的翌日，香港的中西報紙都以最重要的篇幅刋載這個驚人消息。</p>
<p>香港自治的問題，說來並不十分新鮮。本年三月，本港英文「南華早報」曾傳載前任本港南生司司徒永覺夫人在英國發表一　論香港的前途的文字，這位吃過大平洋事件教訓之虧的英國有識之士，吿訴「今後回到香港執行市政的英國人，應以友誼和諒解的態度去對待中國人民」，又說：「香港不應再採取强權政治，應該取消種族歧視，終止不平等待遇和剝削。」她列舉僑居香港的中國人的「希望」作建議：「擴大行政和立法機關，容許中國人參加，並且成立一香港自洽的市政會議，由合法人民選舉議員。」</p>
<p>「簡單的西門」反攻遭「本地青年」回擊</p>
<p>司徒永覺夫人那篇文字，經南華平報刋出後，便引起了一塲論戰。有一個署名「簡單的西門」者投函該報，提出一個正面的反對意見，認爲一般的香港人，祇會取巧，自私，而沒有爲公衆服務的道德觀念，尙未有談到自治的資格。「簡單的西門」那些話遭過了「一個香港人」，「本地靑年」，「本地後生」等人的抨擊。過了一個時候，論戰慢慢地平靜下去。詎楊恭琦不遠千里而來，對香港的居民揭佈了改組香港政制的新猷後，不及三日，那個「簡單的西門」，又在南華早報上信口雌黃，危言聳聽的反對香港自治，他說：他的言論是「以事實爲根據，當香港人民參政後，我可預見行將出現空前腐敗，種族歧視，不公平和鬥爭的日子」。又說：「香港人民大冬數屬於其他民族，這些人迄今仍效忠英國，祇因他們的祖國和英國還未發生糾紛的綠故」。因此，特請英國政府對這問題多作考慮。一簡單的西門」那些鬼話，眞是「簡單」不過。楊恭琦來港之前，不知費了多少時間，「在倫敦與英政府計劃將來之措施，特別與香港自治問題有關」（見夏慤中將致詞）難道那批殖民地部官員的頭腦，竟不及「簡單的西門」？……</p>
<p>搶救此受創區域　奠定中英間合作</p>
<p>不管死硬派英國人的說法也好，開明派英國人的說法也好，一救護此受創區城」而「奠定中英友誼合作」的處置香港間題的辦法，只有一個：那就是乾脆的把這個與中國不可分離的海島交還中國，此外，什麽意見都是無的放矢，或別有企圖。香港原本是中國的，對香港發表眞正的意見，不是那裏百萬的香港人，却是中國的四萬萬五千萬民衆。就在倫敦宣佈爲香港改組政制，「徵詢社會各階層之意見」的翌日，上海的路透社拍出了下面的一個電訊：「當香港轉向民政之際，此問英總領事館門外，本日有人用白粉筆寫下交還香港之要求。據一標請稱：「我們要收回香港，這是我們的海島。」這是中國人民對香港問題的一般意見，不知「簡單的西門」之流，聽了又作何感想？</p>

<h3 id="c117">讀「認識美國」 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 著者　陳劍恒　簡販處　出版期三十四年十二月</p>
<p>在我國的邦盟中，芙國要算是關係最密切的。今後我國的復興建設需要美國的助力很大，我們要想建造一個眞正的民主，和平，統一，團結的新中國，一定要在各方面和美國取得緊密的合作。同時，美國也正如英前首相邱吉爾所說：「美國在今日的地位，不但關係中國的前途，並且與整個的世界和平攸威相關，芙國實有決定世界和平的力量。」再從另一方面說，美國是物質建設最進步的國家，牠的文化的進展，科學的發展，對世界的文化貢獻也很大。我們應該怎樣了解這個國家的情形，再沒有今日的迫切了。</p>
<p>一般人僅僅皮相的了解美國的物質文明，只知道牠是一個生活享受最豐裕的國度，或者僅偏狹地從好萊塢的影片中探得若干美國的社會情形，實則忽視了全面的整統的認識，至於帶着顏色眼鏡去看美國，那更不正確了。</p>
<p>最近，商務出版的「認識美國」一書，完全站在客觀的立塲，剖析美國各方面的情况，到是一本値得一讀的書。著者陳劍恒先生，現任國立中央大學敎授。這本「認識美國」是他在美國考察所得，復參考看關美國的若干名著而寫成，特別是康次（G.　S.　Counts）的「社會文化與敎育」（Soclal　Foundation　of　Education）及凱薩林（C.　H.　Keyserling）的「論美國」（America　Set　Free）兩本名著供給這本書不少有價値的材料，不過陳氏强調「中國人對美國的認識」這一觀點，並不是循着原書做直譯工作，而就彼邦名著中精心採擇自由選裁對中國人特別需要的部份，所以我覺得這種工作確是沒有白費精力，著者使我們從他的書中認識我們盟邦的本來面目。</p>
<p>這本書所討論的範圍很廣，關於美國的家庭制度，物質文明以及他們的民族性都有關發。在經濟和政治方面，提出自由經濟與集體經濟，民主思想與民主政府等重要的問題。教育概况及敎育精神，敎育與新德謨克拉西，更不憚煩地分章詳論。末了在說明芙國對外關係與和平理想以後，附以「新中國的借鑑」，是很値得硏討的）篇。著者吿訴我們怎樣消化德謨克拉西，由美國的現狀反觀我們的國家，勉勵國人迎頤趕上這新民主時代。</p>
<p>要想正認識美國，當然不能忽略牠的民族之史的構成，政治，經濟和教育文化的背景，但美國是一個科學發達的國家，他的立國的基礎乃在牠的敎育精神的發揮，所以我們正不妨以美國的敎育文化爲核心而去理解牠的整個的情形。所以著者很希望我們能把握一個美國文化的輪廓。他深知敎育文化對於社會的改造，具有領導作用，因此特別指示我們認識芙國新敎育的動向。書名爲「認識美國」，又名」美國敎育背景」就是這個意思。雖然說是以教育文化爲核心而討論美國各方面的情况，但並沒有忽視決定教育文化作用的其他社會形態，像政治，經濟和社會狀况，凡足以影响敎有制度者無不一一闡明。</p>
<p>我們知道，近二十餘年以來，我國敎育制度受美國的影響最大，欲谋增進兩國的關係，允不能漠文化的交流。一般人對美國的敎有不無　評，就連歐洲還有不少人懷疑美國的敎育制度。經過這次戰爭，美國的國力所表現於外的，無一不足證明美闕敎育的成功，關於這點，常道直先生有很透澈的看法。美國教育的制度與設施，無疑的將成爲世界敎育思潮中的主流。因此，關於美國敎靑文化的背景以及其一般國情的探討，即使不是專攻敎育者也很需要正確地了解牠。</p>
<p>現在再让我說一說本書的內容。第一章家庭制度的演变，由自足自給的農業家庭，說到西部的開發和產業的發達拆散了家庭的舊日組織，再討論現代家庭的特徵對於婦女自覺運動和家庭制度的前途，兩個重要課題在這一章中有透闢的檢討。第二章物質文明的猛進，使我們不得不羨慕美國天時的優良和地利的豐富，更驚異於他們科學的日新月異，生產技術的進步和交通事業的發展。第三章也是很重要的，我們可以由此了解美國人的特性，和構成這些特性的自然的及歷史的條件。這裏展示給我們的是一股年靑人活潑奮發的民族精神。著者說這個新生的民族性格是屬於年靑人的，他指出美國人的性格：第一對物質特別感覺興趣。第二是感情的天眞衝動。第三是富於活動力。第四是喜歡具體。第五是工商業道德的重視。美國有若干區域，似乎有一些特殊的習性，但就整個文化說，他們却是整統的：「中國和蘇聯之不能分爲許多小的國家，也正如合衆國之能將四十八州，統系於一個文化體系之內。」第四章討論的範圍是自由經濟與集體經濟。先說工業前期的經濟情形，再從分工與市塲的興起而發展到經濟的自由主義。因自由競爭的結果，反映了經濟自由撥展的缺陷：「自由發展的經濟制度有以下的流弊：（一）生產的不穩定；（二）生產與消費的失調；（三）物質與力量的浪費；（四）暴殄天物。」返漸萌芽的經濟的新趨勢是「（一）工商業的聯合；（二）農業的合作；（三）勞工的組合；（四）政府的干預。」從這裏，我們可以看出美國的經濟有走向集體經濟的趨勢。第五章民主思想與民主政府，使我們看到美國歷史上民主思想的文獻，加上一個自由平等的生活環境，自然更容易表現出他們的民主精神了。不過，美國的民主政治實現的方法，已經超越於放任的個人競爭，他們今日所用以爭取自由和幸福方法，已經由放任的個人主義漸漸趨向集體的自由主義。「政府對於全國生產消費機稱的控制，實係出於人民自謀生活保障的意志。」一個進步的健全的敎育系統的確立，實爲達到理想的民主社會的必要手段，因爲政府干預民營事業旣有其必要，那人民就必得獲得監習政府的智慧，這全是敎育問題了。第六章叙說美國今日的初等中等及大學敎育的設施情形，更滲透了自由平等及兒童本位敎育的精神，說明美國人對敎育的種新的觀念—敎育爲人人應得的權利。第七章從經濟環境和國際環境，指示出民治新時代，敎育應以實現全民的幸福爲前提，而民衆敎育的推廣，大衆智　的增長成爲民治新時代的新趨勢。敎育制度，設施，課程，敎村都必須吻合這新時代的需要，像杜威，克伯屈，加德諸氏均已主張敎師必定要做到社會改造的領導者與實行者的地位。第八章是講美國怎樣由一七八九年以後建國的初期，躋於世界强國之列，以及美西戰後國勢的擴張，以及在兩次世界戰爭中所有的貢獻，由對外關係而論到和平理想，的確整個人類的前提，至少有一半操之於美國。著者很有力地稅出：「我們深信和平終應爲人類的最後歸宿，並盼中美兩大愛好和平的民族，能與世界各國携手，共同爲此人類的最高理想不斷奮鬥！</p>
<p>綜觀這本「誌識國美」，雖然作者未曾有過主觀的批評和意兒，但書中所引用的一些一事實和資料，確已足够讓我們了解美國，至少我們能從美國的文化的演進中，明瞭美國爲什麽會成爲決定世界和平的主動者。我們希望大家能從美國文化之發展的史的過程中，得着反照自己的機會—由認識美國而認識自己的國家。</p>
<p>今日的中國正面臨着飢饉和災荒，內戰的危機一觸即發，由於物資的貧乏，大多數的人在疾病與死亡綫上掙扎，國民自私心理根深蒂國，道德日趨衰落，益以敎育文化落後，科學技術幼稚，資源不能開發，民力莫由發揮。這個古老的民族要談更生復興，必須吸受尙在靑年的美國民族的民主精神和創造精神。我們要以虛心的態度，學習美國的長處，迎向民主化工業化的新時代！</p>

<p>— 童方</p>
<p>出版處：新新出版社出版期：三十五年四月上海版</p>
<p>在讀過富代詩人艾靑一獻給鄉村的詩」以後，又得著最近出版的他的「詩論」。封面上印着：「我不知道人類能吾有一天離開詩而生活……」兩行字，從這句話裏我們已經看出詩和人類生活的聯繫。</p>
<p>這本書並不能說是有系統的詩的理論，是集合幾篇重要的論詩的文章而成。但當我讀完了以後，却感到有一股熱烈的活力，生命的力，滿佈於週身，我被作者詩一般的精鍊的有力的辭句所深深地感動了。我覺得這個時代需要詩，需要爲苦難人民呼喊的詩。</p>
<p>這本集子包括五篇重要的題目：第一篇「詩論」，長近七十頁，不是分章列節的論文，而是用語錄體寫出來的，對於詩的觀感，語句生動而有力，頗能咀嚼，這或者由於作者原就是詩人，所以才能寫得這樣洗鍊簡潔吧。從對於詩的泛泛的槪念，詩的精神，到思想，生活，主題與題材，形式，技術，形象，意像，象徵，聯想，想像，語言，創浩等方面都從簡短的語句裏，發抒出作者對詩的看法和見解。這中間有的是藝術的精髓，而瀰漫於料學的創作方法，哲學的思考過程裏。有些警句，簡直就是最進步的藝術理論，是很値得讓人慢慢思索的。即如「凡是能够使人類向上發展的，都是美的，都是善的；也都是詩的。」「哲學抽象的地思考着世界；詩則是具體的地說明着世界——目的都是爲了改造世界。」「愈是生活的，愈是美的，愈是人性的愈是美的。」「人類的語言不絕滅，詩不絕滅。」「人存在，故人思想。」「生活是藝術所由生畏的最肥沃的土壤，思想與情感必須在牠的底層蔓延自已的根鬚。」「聯想與想像是思維的旅行。」都含有詩的氣氛，和深遠的哲學的意味。（這一篇詩論雖說是語錄體，但也不都是短的，有的却由比較多的句子組成一段思想。雖說是零碎的思想，但也可以找到思想的統屬和聯繫。）</p>
<p>第二篇「詩的散文美，」是于篇短文，說明了詩與散文之間的關聯，作者認爲最芙的散文與詩應該是最取能反映生活的，縱有好的音韻而無豐富的形象還是够不上美的條件的。第三篇「詩與宣傳」是一篇比較長的論文，對於詩的評價，照作者所說：「該編重在：牠怎樣以真摯的語言與新鮮的形象，表達了人的願望，生的悲喜與，由暗淡的命運發出希望的光輝和崇高的意志。」他認爲一切藝術，從根本的意義來說，都是宣傳，也只有不離開宣傳，詩的藝術價値才能表現。作者說；「有良心的不應該緘默，用我們詩驚裏那種依附於眞理的力量，去摧毁那些陳腐的世界的渣澤！」他有大地說明了詩的任務。第四篇「詩與時代」强調現代所需要的詩，並叙述中國新詩從五四初期的創始期，乃至西洋格律詩的幕擬，再進到歐美現代詩諸流派的仿製，是必趨途徑。第五篇「詩人論」又是採用語錄體，包括七十五則片斷的思想，這裏面有熱情的呌喊，有精警的暗示，都是詩一般的動人的句了。怎樣才配做一個詩人，以及詩人應該如何完成他歷史的社會的任務，在這些隨錄中都說得很透澈了。</p>
<p>起初我覺得這本書太像「　要」了，或者需要加一番解釋，後來却認爲這些片斷的思想，要讓他有一點含蓄才好，何必完全說破，况且藝術理論（這本集子中很多是「美學」理論）本來也就不能全部道出，讓續者有較多思考探討的機會到也是很必要的。</p>
<p>最後我希望讀者拿鑑賞詩篇的心情和方法，去思索這本含有不少眞理的「詩論。」</p>

<p>— 錫曾　出版書局　文江圖書公司作者　朱雷</p>
<p>偶然在書店中買了幾册書，帶回家去看，也偶然地發現了一冊印刷很精緻的小說「山城的霧李」，我對他似乎有一點過份的愛好，很想在這裏給他抨一下。故事很平凡常見：一個留美專攻汽車工程的靑年魏約翰，於日美戰前道經香港回國，在那裏認識了新聞記者李，二人氣味相　，遽成莫逆，並經李之一介紹，認識了李的夢中情人—楊小姐，他們萍水相逢，又總遠離別，但他和她都留下了個很好的印象，過後約翰到達重慶，他對祖國的夢想過高，致召來莫大失望，困居山城，窮途流落，不久李也到了重慶，仍遷他住在自己家中，並帮他找到職業。繼着日美戰起，楊小姐全家失陷香港，查無音訊，二個人心裏都深擊地愛上了她，但誰也沒有表示，迅速三年，她突然經歷了一個苦難的旅途回到重慶了，二個人中間起了難題，李很稱公約翰，他的學　利他的努力，引起他莫大的同情，李本人又是個樂天主義者，所以很願意犧牲愛情而成全友情，的翰深感李的厚意，就不別而行，去昆加人印緬遠征軍團，楊小妣爲念念不忙於三年前港地的邂逅，竟專程去昆找尋，二人雖得會面，但約翰顯然把事業看得比戀愛重，不久又奉調去緬了，往後約翰又找到一個反渝的機會，不幸飛機爲山域濃霧所阻，折回昆明，楊小姐遭受幾番失望，一面又疑心李在階中捣鬼，因愛成恨，毅然跟第三者結了婚，可憐那時候這一對同病相憐的患難朋友，一個正在湘桂一帶採訪新聞，一個却在反攻臘戍的時候受狙戰死了。</p>
<p>和平以後，李纔明白了他們中間一切的誤會，他找到了一個對楊小姐解釋的　會時，一切都太遲了，就把這個責任推到山城的濃霧和鉀秘的命運身上去，而互祝爲勝利後的中國努力以作結</p>
<p>大體上說，作者的寫法是失敗的，在香港短短的三天，幾乎占了一半篇幅，而且到處有油腔滑調之嫌，後半部在時間上間隔數年之久，空間上歷經數個城市，數件抗戰史實，他却輕描淡寫地應用電影化的手法寫完了，並且有的地方過於簡潔，令人有漏掉一二句即感滄海桑田之苦，作者大槪是寫慣戲劇的緣故，（過去我曾看過他幾個獨幕劇，成績確乎不壞）每段用大刀闊斧的手法處理着，高潮節奏，也安排得非常純熟自然，但小說自有小說的章法，這樣做未免令人疑心太過於巧合和缺少血肉了。</p>
<p>在筆調上說，作者似乎是沈經文先生的門徒，處處可以看到他模仿抄襲的痕跡，如一開始那個多嘴的茶房，分明是「八駿圖」中偸來的，第八段楊小姐去昆明看約翰的一節，又恍惚　「如義」中幾段生動的語氣，筆法，常然，作者有他的總明，也有他的威就，大意的讀者就容易忽略他的墓擬處，但在我看來總覺得太露骨了一點，不知眞讓經文先生看到以後反應如何？</p>
<p>第三點缺憾，就是三個主角的個性太呈模糊，作者只顧到情節的發展，對性格的刻劃毫不深入，第四，作者太迷信宿命論，如寄信老人的預言，海灘上拋水片的預兆，一九四五年在山城中那陣神秘的霧等等，我們雖不敢確切地否定宿命論，但是對一個年靑的作者總顯得不很相宜，　揉做作。</p>
<p>對不起，我前面原說是捧他的，這裏却編派了他許多不是，也許是「愛之過深，未免責之過嚴」的意思。總括地說，作者有他充沛的想像力，有他寫劇的天才。他整個的故事就像一份詳細的電影說明書，態後愈見精彩，結尾一段，更是深摯動人，聰明絕頂，我們且不去計較他的眞實性，至少這個故事的結束是非常成功的。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Xu Yongchang, the government representative on the Committee of Three, and Zhou Enlai, the CCP representative, departed Hankou by plane at 3:45 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, arriving in Beijing at 5:47 PM and landing at the Dajiaochang airfield. Our reporter approached General Xu Yongchang to inquire about the findings of this trip. Xu stated, "There was no war in Central Hubei at all," repeating it three times. He also said that they had signed a communique in Hankou a few hours before leaving. After speaking, he left by car to his private residence to rest. It is reported that General Xu Yongchang will visit Chairman Jiang at 9:00 PM on the 10th to report on the situation in Central Hubei. The reporter then asked Mr. Zhou Enlai for a statement. Mr. Zhou replied, "On the third day after our arrival in Hankou, we went to Xuanhua Store. Because Minister Xu was not feeling well, Wang Xueming went as his representative. However, wherever the Committee of Three went, there was no state of war." At this point, Zhou made a slight rebuttal to Chief of Staff He's statement at yesterday's press conference that the CCP forces in Hubei seemed to want to extend eastward from their original base into the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. After speaking, he drove to his residence at No. 30 Meiyuan New Village to rest. It is reported that Mr. Zhou will meet with Special Envoy Marshall tonight to discuss the trip in detail. Additionally, General Baird, the American representative on the Committee of Three investigating the actual situation in Central Hubei, arrived in Beijing by plane one hour after Xu and Zhou arrived at the airport. After disembarking, Mr. Baird immediately went to Special Envoy Marshall's residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road to report.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] After Xu Yongchang, Zhou Enlai, and Baird returned to Beijing from Hankou, the Central Hubei conflict, which had been causing so much uproar, suddenly seemed to dissipate like smoke, and the truth became clear. Based on Zhou Enlai's remarks, it appears that the CCP's front and rear lines have become disconnected, leading to such a farcical situation. Considering the recent actions of the Communist forces in Northern Jiangsu, it is worth observing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Zhou Enlai said after disembarking that he would very much like to go to Northern Jiangsu with government representatives to investigate the truth of the Nantong incident. Furthermore, according to the reporter's inquiries, after the incident in Central Hubei is clarified, there are still the issues of the opening of the Longhai Railway, the restoration of the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways, and the unfortunate incidents of unprovoked disturbances by the Communist forces in Northern Jiangsu, all of which require the CCP to conduct a thorough review. If the CCP sincerely seeks peace, the government can send personnel to accompany Mr. Zhou to inspect various places at any time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 9th] Zhou Enlai, Baird, and Xu Yongchang's representative Wang Xueming, etc., returned to Hankou from Xuanhua Store on the afternoon of the 9th. In addition, a subsidiary group (also named the Guangshan Group) of the Hankou Executive Headquarters was recently established. The government representative is Colonel Chen Qian, the Communist Party representative is Lieutenant Colonel Ren Shishun, and the American representative is Colonel Haske. On the 9th, they arrived in Xuanhua Store from Hankou and will depart to inspect various areas in the Henan-Hubei border area. Accompanying them are more than ten translators and telegraph operators.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Xu Yongchang, the government representative of the Military Committee of Three, Zhou Enlai, the CCP representative, and Baird, the American representative, went to Hubei to investigate the military conflict. On the 10th, they reached an agreement in Hankou, which was simultaneously sent to the Beiping Military Mediation Executive Headquarters, the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, and the CCP Central Plains Military Region Headquarters. The tripartite meeting unanimously resolved the following items to be sent to the above-mentioned command organizations to order the relevant troops north of the Yangtze River to implement: (1) The commanders of the above-mentioned command organizations of both sides should immediately issue orders to stop small-scale battles and sentry conflicts in the local area. (2) Any movement of troops in violation of the original armistice agreement should be stopped immediately, but small-scale troop movements permitted by the armistice order, such as administrative transfers, may continue to be implemented, but the Executive Headquarters should be notified in advance. (3) The construction of new bunkers and permanent fortifications in the above-mentioned areas should be stopped immediately. (4) The commanders of both sides should quickly send necessary liaison officers to their headquarters and to opposing troop units. These liaison officers should contact the Executive Headquarters, with one of their main tasks being to determine the boundaries of the opposing troops. (5) Agree to transport 1,000 wounded and sick CCP soldiers, 100 family members, and 60 care and medical personnel from the CCP Central Plains Military Region to Anyang, and set May 15 as the date of departure. The detailed procedures should be carried out in accordance with the procedures agreed upon by the Ninth Group's tripartite meeting. Both sides should issue orders to commanders at all levels to ensure that this transportation is not delayed. (6) Agree that the commanders of both sides will immediately exchange lists of detained personnel. All those identified as political prisoners or prisoners of war should be released by June 1 of this year. (7) Agree to guarantee the safety of CCP soldiers who are demobilized for troop reorganization from the CCP Central Plains Military Region to their destinations and after arrival. However, before these personnel return to their hometowns, the CCP Central Plains Military Region should prepare a list stating the destination and route taken, and send it to the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, and guarantee that these personnel are indeed returning home, do not carry weapons, and hold passports.</p>
<p>This agreement does not hinder or affect the past instructions of the Beiping Military Mediation Department or the agreements that the Committee of Three may reach on fundamental issues in the local area.</p>
<p>The above documents were signed by Government Representative Xu Yongchang, CCP Representative Zhou Enlai, and American Representative Baird. The signing time was 3:00 PM on May 10, 35th year of the Republic of China. The signing location was Yang Sen Garden in Hankou. Before signing, General Xu Yongchang made the following formal statement: "It is hoped that all small conflicts and troop movements that have occurred in the currently ceasefired areas of North and Central China will be stopped in the same way. For areas in a state of confrontation, liaison personnel should also be mutually dispatched. Regarding the problems of food supply to areas besieged by the Communist army, the transfer of wounded and sick soldiers, the safety guarantee of demobilized personnel, and the release of captured personnel, the Communist side should resolve them in the same way as the Hankou agreement of May 10." American Representative Baird expressed his deep agreement with this, and CCP Representative Zhou Enlai also expressed general agreement in principle.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Choice for Minister of National Defense: Chen Cheng Has a Higher Chance <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] It is reported that the Ministry of National Defense will be established on June 1, and the choice for minister has not yet been determined, but it is believed that General Chen Cheng, who is in charge of the reorganization and restructuring of the seven military agencies, has a higher chance. Chief of Staff He Yingqin, who completed the major tasks of accepting surrender and sending prisoners of war, will take on a new position and will not be able to go abroad for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Communist Army Responds to Operations in the Northeast, Actively Engaging in North China; The Xuzhou Group's Inspection of the Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway is Obstructed <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Local officials explain the recent active actions taken by the Communist army in various parts of North China as a response to the operations in the Northeast, and in preparation for the event that Marshall's mediation is ineffective, to immediately control the National Army's strongholds with a superior posture. Therefore, in addition to increasing troops in the Northeast, they have also increased pressure on important cities in North China. For example, a division under He Long recently transferred from Zhangjiakou to the vicinity of Beiping, and the Communist army south of Tianjin has also increased compared to before. The Communist army around Tangshan has also increased pressure. On the Shijiazhuang front, the Communist army transferred 1,400 people from Yixian on April 27. In addition, they are gradually moving troops on both sides of various railways closer to the railway, occupying military stations or destroying the tracks.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] The Communist army is stepping up its destruction of the Beining and Jinpu lines. The power lines south of Yaoguantun on the Jinpu Line were completely destroyed at 10:00 PM on the 9th. Between Beitang and Chadian on the Beining Line, about 500 Communist troops occupied the area around 9:00 PM on the evening of the 9th, and have not yet left, with unclear intentions, but the railway there has not been destroyed. Iron bridge No. 160 between Wuhu and Huangshi on the Yuguan-Suizhong section was destroyed by the Communist army on the 8th and repaired at 1:00 PM on the 9th, but the bridge was destroyed again at 12:00 AM last night. Iron bridge No. 171 between Taizi and Gaoling was also destroyed by the Communist army at 1:00 AM this morning, burning more than 700 sleepers, and is currently being repaired. Therefore, the Jinyu section, which had just been opened to traffic, is closed again. It is also learned that passenger trains between Shenyang and Changchun can reach Kaiyuan, and military trains can reach Mangniushao, the first station south of Sipingjie. An iron bridge there was destroyed. Passenger trains between Shenyang and Lushun can reach Dashiqiao, and the line south of Dashiqiao has been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] After Botou on the Jinpu Line was occupied by the Communist army at 9:00 PM on the 6th, the whereabouts of the Botou group are unknown. Government personnel said that before the Communist army attacked and defended the station, they lured the government and American representatives of the group to Nanpi and restricted them. The Communist side said that the Communist army's occupation of Fengjiakou and Botou was because Xu Chunxia, the magistrate of Jiahe County, led security forces to attack the Communist army a few days ago, and the Communist army counterattacked and occupied the two places. As for the government and American representatives of the Executive Group, they went to a certain place before the conflict and were obstructed by traffic. It is not certain whether they are in Nanpi.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] According to official sources, the vicinity of 198 kilometers east of Damao Station on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway has been destroyed by the Communist army. The Xuzhou group planned to inspect it, but was shot at by the Communist army and forced to stop, refusing the inspection. The Zhangdian-Boshan Railway was agreed to be opened to traffic on the 27th of last month, but it has been temporarily suspended again for some reason.</p>

Along the way, he personally visited nearby villages and towns and disaster victims. The disaster situation he learned about was even more serious than rumored. Eating wild grass to satisfy hunger has become a common phenomenon. Deaths from hunger and suicides leaving houses empty were found everywhere. Wang then turned to inspect Lingling and Qiyang.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] It is reported that Special Envoy Marshall may receive Zhu Jingnong, Xi Yushu, and Hu Ding'an, the three representatives designated by the National Assembly Preparatory Meeting to visit Special Envoy Marshall, the day after tomorrow. When the three representatives Zhu, Xi, and Hu meet with Special Envoy Marshall, they will first express the people's highest respect to Special Envoy Marshall for his love for China and his mediation of the Kuomintang-Communist disputes, and will sincerely express the suffering felt by the people in various parts of China to Special Envoy Marshall.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The tenth preparatory meeting of the National Assembly was held at 10:00 AM this morning, attended by 189 representatives. They discussed issues such as the draft constitution and the collection of data, and planned to send representatives to various places to investigate and inquire about opinions on the constitution.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Our reporter recently learned from authoritative American sources that MacArthur's headquarters sent personnel to China to investigate the Nanjing Massacre case for more than a month. The relevant key elements have been largely collected, and a detailed report is currently being compiled in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e8">National Army in the Northeast Stands Ready, Preparing for the Battle of Sipingjie <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 10th] Du Yuming, commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters, said today that the Northeast National Army is currently adopting a "wait-and-see" policy, gathering troops in preparation for a full-scale battle in Sipingjie. The Communist army has concentrated heavy troops in Sipingjie. The National Army is now waiting to see what kind of agreement can be established by the negotiations in Nanjing. In the past, the Communist Party's attitude towards political negotiations has often been shifted by its military victories or defeats. The Communist army's defeat in the Battle of Benxi may make its attitude more conciliatory. Du said that in the Battle of Benxi, the Communist army was defeated and the National Army achieved a decisive victory. In this battle, five to six thousand Communist troops surrendered, three thousand were captured, and ten thousand abandoned their weapons and fled. However, there are more than 100,000 Communist troops in the Benxi area.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 10th] Liu Depu, deputy commander of the Changchun garrison, has already escaped. The previous report from the Central News Agency that Liu had been killed in action during the Changchun battle was inaccurate. According to people from Changchun: After the security team decided to break through on the 18th of last month, they originally planned to gather at Chunbao, 40 miles south of Changchun, but only Chief of Staff Wang Zhengguo of the Garrison Headquarters, Senior Advisor Cui Zhiguang, and two soldiers arrived there. Wang and Cui continued to Phoenix Tuo, where they met Deputy Commander Liu. They went around Xi'an, Xifeng, and other places for ten days before arriving at Shuangmiaozhi (south of Kaiyuan), where the National Army was located, and escaped from the difficult situation. Chen Jiazhen, commander of the Changchun garrison, was shot in the leg and suffered inflammation, which was swollen like wood. Chen and Lu Zhengcao, deputy commander of the "Democratic Allied Army" of the CCP, are from the same hometown and classmates. Lu's first words when he met Chen were: "If I had known it was you, I wouldn't have attacked." Although the Communist army has occupied Changchun for many days, they still cannot open the safe of the Central Bank of Manchuria's silver notes. The safe is one of the most solid safes in the world, comparable to the famous Bank of England safe. The safe has three keys, which must be used in succession to open it, and none can be missing. Now the three keys are gone, and ordinary knives and axes cannot open it. The only way to destroy the safe is to use fierce, high-temperature weapons, such as rocket launchers, to burn it, but in that case, the silver notes in the safe will also be destroyed.

<h3 id="e10">National Army is Gradually Being Downsized; The Number of Surplus Officers This Year Will Reach 100,000 <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The downsizing work of the National Army is currently being implemented gradually according to the planned plan. It is estimated that the number of surplus officers this year will reach 100,000. If combined with the surplus and unemployed officers currently being trained by the various officers' corps of the Ministry of Military Administration, the number of officers to be demobilized will be around 200,000. According to our reporter's recent information from related parties, among these 200,000 demobilized officers, the military authorities have decided to select 10,000 outstanding officers to provide them with advanced studies and store them as new military cadres. 150,000 people will be allowed to enter the Central Training Corps to receive vocational training according to their wishes and expertise, so that they can transfer to individual occupations. In addition, methods will be sought to transfer 30,000 people in groups, and 10,000 people will be handled in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Military Officers and Enlisted Personnel, that is, those who have been suspended from service for more than three years and have not returned to service will be dismissed. Those who have been dismissed, suspended, or suspended for more than three years and have not been appointed, those whose performance has been unsatisfactory for three consecutive years, those who have reached three times the stagnation of their official rank (four times in peacetime) and cannot be promoted, those whose physical condition is weak or injured and cannot serve in active service, and when the number of retirements is stipulated due to the necessity of replenishment and official quota, or those whose performance is ranked last, will be retired.

<h3 id="e11">Interview with Representatives of the General Chamber of Commerce, Our Correspondent in Beijing <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ming</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The enlarged preparatory meeting of the General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China concluded at 5:30 PM on the 10th, after a six-day session, having passed 164 proposals and a draft of the general charter. On the morning of the 11th, all representatives toured scenic spots in the capital city, with two large buses hired by the meeting for their transportation.</p>
<p>With some areas of the country mired in special circumstances, on the one hand, grain and materials are blockaded, and on the other hand, there are famine, displacement, and wailing everywhere! The economic landscape arising in this situation inevitably faces a crisis. As a result, prices are soaring, and people's lives are subjected to bottomless oppression. Naturally, the most intense struggles occur between labor and capital. Amidst this intensifying situation, a national enlarged preparatory meeting of the General Chamber of Commerce is being held in the capital. This association is composed of thousands, even tens of thousands, of organized guilds. The convocation of this meeting today undoubtedly holds significant meaning for China's economic future.</p>
<p>The history of chambers of commerce in China dates back to the 27th year of the Guangxu reign. The first was the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the National Chamber of Commerce was also established in Shanghai. Since the "September 18th" Incident, the northeastern provinces have been under enemy control, and North China, as well as the Yangtze River basin, have been subjected to enemy incursions, making it impossible for the General Chamber of Commerce to convene a general meeting.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, initially, due to the unstable war situation and the unsettled state of many businesses and industries, no organizational efforts were undertaken. It was not until June 6th two years ago that the National Chamber of Commerce was established in the provisional capital, Chongqing. However, due to the war situation, the participating units were limited to the provinces in the Great Rear Area. This meeting, with the participation of representatives from the Northeast and overseas, symbolizes the unification of the country. But this meeting is still only a preparatory meeting, which is already enough to excite us.</p>
<p>At the opening ceremony of the meeting, Wang Xiaolai, a prominent figure in Shanghai's business circles and chairman of the presidium, said, "The main purpose of this association is to promote national unity, sincere solidarity, and to industrialize the economy, laying a stable foundation." These two short sentences can be said to be the most important focus of future livelihood issues. We must transform from light industry, from handicrafts, from relying on foreign raw materials, into a highly industrialized nation.</p>
<p>During the meeting, they seriously discussed foreign trade, which is related to the nation's lifeline, and how to develop and support private enterprises. In addition, active cases concerning industrial and commercial personnel, the protection and training of employees, and various investigations and research were also presented for discussion. A total of 146 cases were discussed. The central theme of their discussion was the current state of industry and commerce in the Southwest and the future development of industry and commerce in Beijing and Shanghai after the political center shifted from the Southwest to Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Yangshan, a representative from Chongqing, spoke to the reporter. The reporter asked him, "After the transfer of the political and economic center, what is the current state of industry and commerce in Chongqing? What are your expectations for the future?" He said solemnly, "From the victory until now, we have been stuck in this dangerous state. For the sake of victory, institutions and individuals are all moving eastward (even if they can't move, they are all planning to return home), so all purchasing has become a problem. There is no market for finished products. In order to maintain the lives of the workers who have endured eight years of hardship with us, we have to continue production. Goods are piling up one after another, with no one interested. Goods cannot be exported, and capital cannot flow. When capital cannot flow, both labor and capital are trapped in a terrible collapse. Therefore, many small factories could not withstand this huge wave and have closed down one after another. Later, after consultations with the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other relevant opportunities, it was decided that the government would purchase finished products, purchase production tools, and send workers back to their hometowns. Now, it is finally all resolved. However, although the labor unrest has been resolved, the machinery that the bosses obtained during the eight years of hardship has also been sold off. Is this really the right way to solve labor unrest?" Mr. Pan, standing on the side of capital but sympathizing with labor, issued the deepest sigh, a sigh inspired by the impending economic collapse.</p>
<p>He also said: "Currently, the textile industry is the only one that can barely survive; they can still make a profit. As for the machinery and steel industries, they have all collapsed. Although the textile industry can temporarily survive, we lack working capital and cannot store a sufficient quantity of raw materials, so even if we can make money, we cannot make the most of the machinery. Moreover, in the future, when American cotton is imported and cloth is transported internally, foreign goods will be cheaper, and our costs will increase. How can we compete with them? Therefore, the result is still inevitable collapse."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xiaolai, a representative from Shanghai, said to the reporter, "I think all strength is based on organization, and even the economy is based on organization. For example, the Japanese will try to monopolize the market regardless of whether they have raw materials. Conversely, the Jews have raw materials, money, and people, but they still cannot succeed. Therefore, the power of organization is very important. Over the past eight years, China's industry and commerce have reached a point of 'hardship,' but how should we deal with it now? The only key is to revitalize factories. Shanghai is a hub for foreign trade and a place for consumption. For the country as a whole, to develop industry, it is best to set up factories in the places where the products are produced, and to take advantage of the convenience of labor and water sources. In this way, our economy can truly become industrialized." Mr. Luo Zongqiang, a representative from Tianjin, told the reporter about the current state of industry and commerce in Tianjin. He said: "Tianjin has a total of 161 trade associations, owning 1,796 factories, but only 1,240 factories are currently operating, with the remaining 555 being shut down. Among them, 134 are state-owned, 1,642 are commercially operated, and the status of 20 is unclear. In terms of nature, the most are cotton weaving factories, with over 500, followed by metalworking factories with over 150, the chemical industry with around 200, the food industry with over 100, the construction industry with 25, and other daily necessities with over 200. Currently, the crux of the problem lies entirely in whether security and transportation can be resolved, but the communist army is destroying everything everywhere, and some raw materials must be supplied from abroad. At its peak, the number of unemployed workers reached over 100,000, and after some relief efforts, there are still over 30,000. Wages are around 60,000 to 100,000 yuan per month, but labor unrest still occurs frequently."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yiqi, a representative from Nanjing, said: "To revitalize Nanjing's industry, we should first rectify the existing handicrafts and light industries. The government has now designated the Yanziji area as an industrial zone, and more than 30 factories moving east have registered in Nanjing. Generally, cotton weaving factories are still the most numerous, followed by chemical factories. However, paper mills and oil mills are also in the planning stage. Currently, there are 60,000 to 70,000 workers employed, and around 30,000 unemployed workers. The treatment is slightly lower than in Shanghai, between 50,000 and 80,000 yuan." Mr. Lin Xiongzheng, a representative from Taiwan, came from Taiwan. He said that Taiwan produces sugar, rice, timber, tea, camphor, and other products, and has over 100 factories, with the sugar industry being the most prosperous and its exports being the largest. However, there are some restrictions, and the most lacking are cotton cloth and fertilizers.</p>
<p>The representatives who attended this national preparatory meeting of the General Chamber of Commerce will return to their respective regions after the meeting to strengthen their organizations in an effort to convene a formal general meeting of the National Chamber of Commerce after the autumn. This organizational strength will undoubtedly lead China's industrial and commercial sectors into a healthy state of development, and the future national economic foundation can thereby become increasingly consolidated.</p>

<p>(The picture shows Eisenhower arriving in Beijing and walking out of the airport with welcomers. Front row, from left to right: He Yingqin, Dwight D. Eisenhower, George C. Marshall, Chen Cheng)</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Dwight D. Eisenhower arrived at Atsugi Airport outside Tokyo at 2:05 PM on the 10th, flying from Shanghai. General MacArthur and U.S. Eighth Army Commander Eichelberger welcomed him at the airport. This was the first meeting between the two commanders of the Allied forces in Europe and the Pacific after defeating the powerful enemies Germany and Japan. Eisenhower also knew that this meeting was particularly rare. When he firmly grasped MacArthur's outstretched hand, he couldn't help but say with emotion, "Mac, how are you? I didn't expect to meet again here." MacArthur smiled and replied, "It's great to see you again." The two generals patted each other on the shoulder while speaking. The two generals had a meal at the embassy and then went to MacArthur's headquarters to meet with headquarters staff. They also scheduled a meeting with the heads of various departments at headquarters on the evening of the 11th. On Sunday morning, they inspected the First Cavalry Division of the Tokyo Occupation Army, and then, in the afternoon, they traveled with Eichelberger through scenic mountain areas to southern Honshu. Eisenhower is currently scheduled to spend two days inspecting the troops and then return to the country by plane from near Kobe on the 15th. Eisenhower's flight from Shanghai to Tokyo was hampered by severe weather, so a special radar landing aircraft was used to control it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Dwight D. Eisenhower flew to Beijing from Manila the day before yesterday to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang and General Marshall to discuss military issues and to give speeches to senior U.S. military officers. At 7:30 PM, he arrived in Shanghai with U.S. Army Commander in China Lieutenant General Gillem and others. Eisenhower originally did not intend to come to Shanghai, but decided to do so ten minutes before departure, so the city authorities had no prior knowledge. After receiving the news, Mayor Qian immediately visited General Wedemeyer's residence on Dallas Street with Commander Li and Jin Zhilang, the chief of the Social Affairs Section, and had a twenty-minute conversation. Eisenhower, with a smiling face and amiable manner, inquired about the Chinese famine, the Communist Party, and other issues from Mayor Qian. Later, he had talks with U.S. military officers in the city.

<h3 id="e13">Investigation of Traitor Liang Hongzhi Completed, Shanghai High Procuratorate Announces Full Text of Indictment <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] The investigation of Liang Hongzhi, the head of the puppet "Renovation Government", has been completed by the High Procuratorate, and a public prosecution has been initiated. The full text of the indictment is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Defendant Liang Hongzhi, male, 64 years old, from Changle, former President of the puppet Legislative Yuan, residing at 150 Bixun Road, currently in custody.</p>
<p>The above-named defendant, in the case of suspicion of being a traitor (Case No. 125 of the 35th year of the Republic), has been investigated by this prosecutor, and it is deemed that a public prosecution should be initiated. The criminal facts, evidence, and relevant laws are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Criminal Facts</p>
<p>Defendant Liang Hongzhi served successively as a counselor of the State Council, Secretary-General of the Beijing Garrison Headquarters, Senator, and Secretary-General of the Executive Government during the Beijing government era. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, he lived in seclusion in Hang County. In August of the 26th year of the Republic of China, at the beginning of the War of Resistance, he moved to Shanghai. When Nanjing and Shanghai successively fell, and the National Government moved west, he conceived the idea of colluding with the enemy and betraying the country. He became acquainted with enemy Major General Harada and others, preparing to build a puppet regime in the occupied areas of Central China. On March 28th of the 27th year, the puppet "Renovation Government" was formally established in Nanjing. The puppet government had two courts and eight departments. The defendant served as the puppet Executive Yuan President, holding full power in the position of chief, issuing orders, and chairing the political meetings of the heads of the puppet courts and departments. He changed to the five-color national flag, summoned troops, consolidated the rear for the enemy, and forcibly took over the Jianghai Customs located in the concessions, seizing central customs duties. He also successively signed agreements with enemy leaders regarding railways, telecommunications, salt affairs, and banks, organized the Central China Railway Company, the Central China Electric Communications Company, the Central China Hydropower Company, and the Central China Salt Industry Company, cooperating with the enemy. He jointly established the Xingzhong Bank, issued banknotes, circulated them in the market, and disrupted finance. He jointly established the China Shipping Company and approved the establishment of inland river shipping companies, allowing the enemy to navigate the inland rivers unimpeded. He also established a smoking prohibition bureau, specializing in public sales, transporting opium, and registering smokers, assisting the enemy in implementing a poisoning policy, and collecting opium and other taxes, opening up financial sources for the puppet government. Not long after the establishment of the puppet "Renovation Government", the defendant consulted with Wang Kemin, the chairman of the puppet "Provisional Government" in North China, on merging. After several rounds of negotiations, on September of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the puppet "United Committee of the Chinese Government" was established in Beiping. The defendant also served as a member. The puppet committee held several meetings in places such as Ping, Jing, and Qingdao, and issued and promoted absurd speeches and actions such as ceasing war to save the country, opposing the central government. On April 5th of the 28th year of the Republic of China, Wang Zhaoming betrayed the party and the country and secretly came to Shanghai, preparing to establish the puppet "National Government". The defendant and Wang, seeing that Wang had enemy support and their own power was gradually weakening, after consultations, issued declarations on September 21st and 23rd of the same year from the puppet "United Committee of the Chinese Government" and the puppet "Renovation" and "Provisional" regimes, responding to Wang's peace movement. On January 23rd of the following year, the defendant and Wang met in Qingdao, jointly deciding to organize a Central Political Conference. On March 20th, they held the conference in Nanjing, negotiating and determining the outline for the establishment of the puppet "National Government", the organization regulations for the puppet Central Political Committee and the Committee of North China Affairs, and announced the candidates for the ministers of various courts and ministries of the puppet "National Government". On the 30th of the same month, they realized what they called the "return of the national capital" and issued an absurd declaration of returning the capital and the program of the puppet "National Government". At the same time, the puppet "United Committee of the Chinese Government", the "Renovation Government", and the "Provisional Government" were all dissolved. The defendant was renamed a member of the puppet Central Political Committee, concurrently serving as the President of the puppet Control Yuan. Until November 20th of the 33rd year, Chen Gongbo, the President of the puppet Legislative Yuan, succeeded Wang as the Chairman of the puppet National Government and concurrently the President of the Executive Yuan due to Wang's death. The defendant then took over as the President of the puppet Legislative Yuan until the victory of the War of Resistance. He has now been sent to this office by the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission for investigation in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Grounds for Prosecution</p>
<p>In this case, the defendant has confessed without denying during the investigation the details of how he organized the puppet "Renovation Government" starting in February of the 27th year of the Republic of China, served as the President of the puppet Executive Yuan, held full power, and consulted with Wang Kemin, the chairman of the puppet "Provisional Government", on merging to establish the puppet "United Committee of the Chinese Government", concurrently serving as a member. In the year the traitor Wang established the puppet "National Government", he also served as a member of the puppet Central Political Committee, President of the Control Yuan, President of the Legislative Yuan, etc., until the victory of the War of Resistance. This is consistent with the statement made in the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, and there are also his handwritten confession, news reports over the years, the Shanghai Yearbook, the New China Handbook, and other time-related records that can prove the facts are extremely clear. It is found that the defendant was originally a well-known pro-Japanese Anfu faction politician. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, seeing the military failures of our army and that Wang Kemin had organized the puppet "Provisional Government" in Beiping, he took it upon himself to emulate it, determined to collude with the enemy and betray the country, and in the occupied areas of Central China under the enemy's military control, he established the puppet "Renovation Government", seized the capital, believed in administrative orders, changed the national flag, summoned troops, and created a situation of confrontation with the central government, fueling the enemy's aggressive flames and shaking the will of the military and civilians to resist the war. His collusion with enemy countries and resistance to his own country are obvious. During the period when the defendant was the head of the puppet "Renovation Government", he held great power, promoted puppet politics, established puppet troops, and established four military control zones in Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Haibu, implementing pacification work, which clearly assisted the enemy's military, consolidated defenses, and prevented the activities of our guerrilla units. His obstruction of the War of Resistance was profound and significant. The establishment of various agreements with the enemy and the joint establishment of the Central China Railway Company, the Central China Electric Communications Company, and the Central China Hydropower Company were all in the name of joint ventures with the enemy, handing over important undertakings such as public transportation to the enemy. The Central China Salt Industry Company and the Xingzhong Bank, which were also jointly established, were institutions that monopolized the transportation and sale of salt, which is essential for people's livelihood, and issued puppet Xingzhong coupons, disrupting finance. The establishment of a smoking prohibition bureau to handle the public sale of opium and transport opium was nothing less than assisting the enemy in implementing a policy of poisoning the people and endangering the race. Seizing the Jianghai Customs and intercepting customs duties was also using violence to prevent our customs authorities from exercising their powers. In addition, the joint establishment of the Shanwa Shipping Company with the enemy and the approval of the establishment of inland river shipping companies, recognizing the enemy's inland river navigation rights, and the collection of opium and various taxes were all methods of collecting excessive taxes and levies, plundering people's wealth, and opening up financial sources for the puppet government. The above points were all measures that sacrificed rights to benefit the enemy and harmed the country and the people. Although the defendant claimed that the motivation for colluding with the enemy and betraying the country was driven by a tragic and compassionate emotion, so he went to hell to save sentient beings, but regardless of the various measures taken after the establishment of the puppet "Renovation Government", as mentioned earlier, there was nothing beneficial to the people at all. Furthermore, it is found that when the enemy invaded and the War of Resistance began, the whole country was united in hatred against the enemy. The defendant actually regarded the country's war of resistance and survival as an opportunity for personal advancement and profit, not hesitating to recognize the thief as his father, allowing the enemy to use him to establish a puppet regime in the occupied areas, promote puppet politics, and resist the central government, almost causing the nation and the race to fall into a state of eternal doom. His madness was extreme. Even in the defendant's own confession, he admitted that "with regard to the country's standpoint, he did not take all aspects into consideration, which is the confusion of a businessman and cannot excuse him from criminal responsibility," how can he be allowed to use sophistry to refute the charges? Furthermore, not long after the establishment of the puppet "Renovation Government", the defendant conspired to merge with the puppet "Provisional Government" in Beiping, which clearly followed the will of the enemy and promoted the unification and solidarity of the puppet regime, thereby strengthening the force to resist the central government. Later, when the traitor Wang colluded with the enemy, issued the notorious telegram, and prepared to establish the puppet "National Government" with the support of the enemy, the defendant knew that the situation was irresistible, so he colluded with them, not only issuing declarations in response, but also cooperating with them to prepare and plan in detail to bring it to fruition. After the establishment of the puppet "National Government" and the dissolution of the "Renovation Government", he was still enthusiastic and reluctant to leave, participating in the puppet "National Government" and serving successively as the President of the puppet Control Yuan and the President of the puppet Legislative Yuan. At that time, although he was no longer the chief and Wang did not trust him with his heart, causing him to be unable to act alone, he was still a key member of the puppet organization's central leadership and a member of the puppet Central Political Committee, which was the highest political guidance organ of the puppet government that decided on major policies, military affairs, and foreign affairs. He should also bear joint responsibility for the declaration of war on our allies Britain and the United States on January 9th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty on November 30th, the declaration of the joint declaration between China and Manchuria, the recognition of the puppet Manchukuo, and the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty on October 30th of the 32nd year. The defendant led the organization of the puppet regime at the beginning of the War of Resistance. Although the puppet organization changed several times, the defendant participated in it throughout, serving in key positions. He ignored the interests of the state and the survival of the nation, brazenly colluding with the enemy and betraying the country. He was truly a great traitor and scoundrel. Considering the circumstances, there is no way to be lenient, and it is requested that he be severely punished in order to rectify popular sentiment and extend the national law.</p>
<p>In summary, the defendant has committed the crime of colluding with enemy countries and conspiring to resist his own country under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. In accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is initiated. Please adjudicate according to the law immediately. Dai Rongduo, Prosecutor of the Shanghai High Court.</p>

The overseas Chinese in Vietnam, because of the arbitrary taxation by the Vietnamese authorities, have requested our consulate in Hanoi to make representations.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Britain's New Policy Towards Egypt <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>On the 7th of this month, British Prime Minister Attlee announced that Britain had decided to withdraw all British naval, land, and air forces stationed in Egypt and to negotiate with Egypt. Since the British government made this decision, opposition leaders Churchill and Eden have criticized the British government's Egyptian policy in Parliament. Churchill saw that Britain's operations in Egypt for nearly a century, especially in the last sixty years, were about to collapse, and he reminisced about the glory of the past British Empire. Moreover, the world situation is unstable, and he naturally felt emotional and wistful about the British government's decision. However, the British government's new decision on Egypt was finally supported by Parliament, because the government's Labour Party has an absolute majority of seats in the British Parliament, and the opposition can only shout out opposition, but cannot shake the government's established policy. Churchill's speech in Parliament focused on Britain's operations in Egypt over the past sixty years, and he could not bear to destroy the operations of his predecessors. Moreover, the Suez Canal in Egypt is the key to the British Empire's transportation line, and troops should be stationed there to ensure imperial transportation. He also said that Egypt controls the hub of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and if Britain withdraws from Egypt, it will inevitably affect its entire strategic plan. However, Attlee said that the British government's decision was made after consulting the heads of the navy, land, and air forces and the heads of various autonomous territories, and that the opinions were the same before making this decision. Now that the British Parliament has supported the government's Egyptian policy, and the British-Egyptian negotiations are in progress, the entire British naval, land, and air forces stationed in Egypt will soon begin to withdraw, and the period should not be far away, but the complete withdrawal of all troops may take a longer period.</p>
<p>Britain's new decision on Egypt is certainly extremely wise. The rising national sentiment in Egypt has forced Britain to take this resolute decision. A country with national consciousness does not allow foreign troops to be stationed within its territory. Rather than incur anti-British sentiment due to the stationing of troops, which makes the defense of the Egyptian canal more difficult, it is better to voluntarily withdraw the troops in order to win people's favor. Sixty years ago, Britain sent troops to occupy Egypt for the benefit of Britain; today, the British army's withdrawal from Egypt is also for the benefit of Britain. Although the Labour Party, which is in power in Britain, has a more left-leaning policy, they are all British, first British and then Labour Party members, so all measures can ultimately put national interests first. From Britain's point of view, the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Egypt has satisfied Egypt's national aspirations and is also beneficial to Britain itself. The skillful application of this policy, the old-fashioned "empire builders" or "Victorian era" figures like Churchill, may not know the bottom line. Isn't "peaceful penetration" a feature of this era?</p>
<p>It is worth noting the evolution of the strategic relationship caused by the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt. In fact, it should be said that the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt is the result of the evolution of the strategic relationship gained from the experience of this World War. Judging from British Prime Minister Attlee's announcement, the British government made this decision after consulting the Chiefs of Staff of the Navy, Land, and Air Force and obtaining their consent. It can be seen that Britain's withdrawal of British troops stationed in Egypt was originally a new strategic decision. Due to the use of airborne troops, the development of air force power, the possibility of remote bombing, and the elimination of the threat from the Berlin and Rome axis, Egypt's strategic value is no longer what it used to be. At this time, the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Egypt can not only satisfy the wishes of the Egyptian people, but also allow Britain to have new strategic arrangements. Indeed, Britain spent sixty-four years operating the Alexandria naval port, which was originally an important stronghold of the British Navy's Mediterranean Fleet; the British army's withdrawal from Egypt will inevitably abandon this important naval port. Due to the experience of this war, naval strategy has undergone fundamental changes. Traditional naval strategies are no longer applicable. Modern naval warfare has gone beyond the traditional conditions of having naval bases. During this war, the US Navy's operations in the Pacific were a clear example. South Africa, East Africa, Ceylon, and the Near East may be used as British military bases in the future to take on the task of defending the Suez Canal. The withdrawal of British troops from Egypt is by no means an abandonment of its responsibility to protect the Suez Canal, but a new strategic decision to protect the canal. The negotiations currently underway between Britain and Egypt include defense matters in the canal area, which shows that Britain has not relaxed its responsibility for defending the area.</p>
<p>What we feel deeply here is that when Britain decided to withdraw British troops stationed in Egypt and recognized the independence of Britain, the Soviet Union demanded to take over Italian North Africa and East Africa. This is a very interesting contrast in policy. The intellectual level of the people of Italian North Africa is quite high, and they were originally influenced by ancient Roman culture; later, they were also influenced by Saracen culture. When the Soviet Union was "supporting" national movements everywhere, it advocated that it should take over Italian North Africa itself. Although this may be a diplomatic means and may not be able to achieve the real purpose of taking over, it is not difficult to imagine that it is paying attention to North Africa and East Africa. Egypt has gained complete independence due to the withdrawal of British troops, but those who regard themselves as "protectors of Islam" are afraid that they will not be succeeded by anyone due to Mussolini's death. In today's world trend, the survival of small countries may depend on the breath of big countries at any time; Egypt has indeed become completely independent, satisfying their national aspirations for generations. How Egypt will deal with itself in this turbulent world is really related to the lasting peace of the world. We hope that Egypt will cherish the fruits of their victory. For Britain, what this new decision symbolizes is not the decline of Britain but the rebirth of Britain. The relationship between countries should be built on the basis of trust and love to be lasting. The era of "empire" and "conquest" is over, and it is a new era! The British government can grasp the spirit of this new era and make new policy decisions, even though Churchill may not like it, but in any case, it is wise.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Foreign Ministers of the Four Countries Too Far Apart in Opinions; Yesterday's Meeting Again Without Conclusion; Soviet Union Firmly Opposes Convening a Peace Conference <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: After the Soviet Union refused to participate in initiating the convening of a peace conference, the foreign ministers of the four powers held a meeting again today in an attempt to reach a compromise, but to no avail. It was decided to hold an informal meeting tomorrow morning. In this morning's meeting, British Foreign Secretary Bevin had a disagreement with Molotov and formally told Molotov: "To oppose the convening of a peace conference is not only to veto the peace conference, but also to veto the right of all participating countries to speak. I absolutely cannot agree to this kind of behavior." At that time, the French Foreign Minister proposed a compromise, advocating that the peace conference be postponed and that the foreign ministers of the four powers could hold a meeting on the 15th of next month (the date recommended by Bernes for holding the conference) to make another effort to formulate a peace treaty, and then decide the date for convening the peace conference.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] The meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries not only saw the conditions of the new European peace treaty rejected, but also had conflicting opinions on the issue of convening a twenty-one-nation peace conference to discuss the terms of the treaty, resulting in many obstacles to the meeting. People in general today expect that the representatives will make a final effort to reconcile the differences between the Soviet Union and the United States on convening a peace conference, but most observers believe that it is difficult to reach an agreement, and the foreign ministers will return to their respective countries at the beginning of next week. The representatives also privately admitted that there are several fundamental issues on which the opinions between the Soviet Union and the Western powers are too far apart, and there is little hope of reconciliation. During yesterday's meeting, US Secretary of State Bernes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov argued for two hours over the US proposal to convene a peace conference on June 15. Molotov argued that the four countries should first agree on a peace treaty before convening a peace conference. The US representative strongly opposed it, and the opinions of both sides were even more different, so the meeting adjourned. British sources said today that Molotov has accused the United States of violating the Moscow Three-Power Agreement, because at that time Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union had decided that the foreign ministers must first formulate a peace treaty before submitting it to the peace conference, and the peace conference must be convened when the draft treaty has been drafted and is waiting for consideration. At the same time, participants in the meeting revealed that the Soviet Union had requested one of the two new warships of Italy, which Britain and the United States had refused. It is heard that this matter is one of the key points in the naval clause related to the nurturing and appointment of the treaty, and the four countries' naval experts have also reached a stalemate in discussing the relevant naval clause.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] French sources expect that the foreign ministers of the four countries will remain in Paris at the beginning of next week to exchange views on the German issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Rome Radio announced today that Yugoslav troops have arrived in Aidosino, eighteen miles northeast of Trieste.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] President Truman told the press today that US policy toward Britain and the Soviet Union will not undergo significant changes due to the imminent breakdown of the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. When a reporter asked about a rumored possible change in US policy, the biggest change would be to strengthen relations with Britain, the president said that he had not heard of this statement. He also frankly stated that he was one of the policy makers. When asked about the apparent failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the president said that he had no comment yet.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th, United Press] President Truman held a press conference today, denying that the Foreign Ministers Conference of the Four Powers had broken down. He also said that he had authorized Secretary of State Bernes to issue a statement at the appropriate time.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Churchill Speaks at the Dutch Parliament: Advocates for the Organization of a European Federation; Small Nations' Sacred Inviolability Should Be Affirmed; So-Called Democracy Means Government Belongs to the People <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 9th] Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, accompanied by his wife and daughter Mary, arrived here last night. Today, he delivered a thirty-minute speech at the Dutch Parliament. Churchill advocated for the organization of a European Federation, encompassing both Eastern and Western Europe. This federation could arise from the United Nations framework, and its unity would be unprecedented since the fall of the Roman Empire. Churchill also championed the affirmation of small nations' sacred inviolability, stating that the modern world should prioritize the protection of small nations' rights. The purpose of the United Nations organization is to establish "justice through strength," protected by "the strength of justice." Churchill vehemently criticized those who seek to "mold the entire world into a single form," and reproached the unconscious promotion of nationalism as the world's supreme ideology. According to Churchill, the most outstanding aspect of democracy lies in whether the people have the freedom to criticize the government and access to independent courts. In short, it is "whether the government belongs to the people, or the people belong to the government." Churchill stated: "I hope that the twenty-year treaty between Britain and the Soviet Union will prove to be a true cornerstone of world peace, and I hope that Western European democracies can grow closer to each other within the European Federation." Churchill's speech was met with thunderous applause.</p>

<p>India Permitted to Serve as Director</p>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 9th] The Board of Governors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development today approved new regulations, allowing India to retain its right to serve as a director of the bank (for a two-year term), even if the Soviet Union is also a director at that time. Therefore, after the implementation of this regulation, India becomes one of the five major directorial countries. The Monetary Fund also adopted a similar resolution yesterday regarding India serving as a director. This regulation favors India; otherwise, India would have to postpone joining the International Bank and Fund for two years. The number of director seats in both the bank and the fund can be temporarily increased from five to six. The total number of director seats in both the bank and the fund, whether through appointment or election, should be temporarily increased from twelve to thirteen.</p>

<p>[United Press, Simla, 10th] The Indian Governor-General's Executive Council (equivalent to the Indian cabinet, where the British Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Auchinleck, is equivalent to the Minister of Defense, and other positions are partly held by British personnel, but the majority are Indians) today submitted its resignation to King George VI, to facilitate discussions on Indian independence at the Simla Conference. India's request to negotiate with representatives of the British Cabinet seems to be becoming hopeful. It is said that this move by the council demonstrates Britain's determination to implement the guarantees made by British Prime Minister Attlee, ensuring India gains freedom.

Chifley reiterated that the Australian government hopes the United States will maintain significant attention to the Pacific and suggested that many issues be resolved through the entire United Nations plan, rather than addressing them piecemeal.</p>

<p>[United Press, Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, 9th] The U.S. plan to test the power of the atomic bomb on Bikini Atoll in July is approaching maturity. At that time, the U.S. Marine Corps will protect this world's biggest secret, with orders to kill without exception. The U.S. Army and Navy Joint Task Force is currently using Kwajalein Island as a base for testing atomic energy, and its fortification methods are being intensified daily to ensure foolproof security. From July 1st, no one is allowed to pass through here without special permission. The atomic bombs used will be stored in specially built cellars, covered with canvas for concealment and surrounded by wire mesh. Only a few people are allowed to enter. Transporting the atomic bombs to Kwajalein Island will also be kept absolutely secret, so as not to attract the attention of the curious. Even its size and shape can be regarded as valuable reports in countries that do not yet have atomic bombs. U.S. troops are patrolling the coast under the command of Major Hosse. According to Hosse, "It is not easy for a soldier to stop a senator or government official from entering this restricted area, but the orders will be strictly enforced. Anyone who does not obey the orders of the guards will be easily injured."</p>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Aboard the U.S. Navy Flagship USS Mount McKinley, 9th] The USS Mount McKinley, the flagship of the special mixed fleet for atomic bomb testing under the command of Vice Admiral Blandy, left San Francisco Harbor yesterday for Pearl Harbor. Blandy will fly to Pearl Harbor on May 15th and transfer to the ship to command the atomic bomb test on Bikini Island.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Diego, 9th] Navy Air Force Equipment Commander Sprague, who is in charge of the atomic bomb test, said at his flagship, the aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La, that the orders received by the commanders in the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb test are to report the truth of the matter to the American people in order to ensure public safety. USS Shangri-La departed from here along the coast today carrying journalists and radio reporters. Some of the equipment prepared for collecting scientific records during the atomic bomb explosion will be tested along the way. One of these is a fleet of pilotless fighter planes, entirely controlled by radio, which will be launched from the aircraft carrier. This is the first public demonstration of unmanned aircraft. These planes, along with Army B-17 Flying Fortresses, will immediately fly through the atomic cloud over Bikini after the atomic bomb explodes, equipped with various scientific instruments to automatically record data. Sprague announced that his flagship will depart from here on the 21st of this month to carry out the testing work.</p>

<p>[United Press Tokyo, 10th] With the failure of the plan to organize a coalition cabinet or a "People's Democratic Front" government in Japan, it is generally speculated that Grand Chamberlain Tsuneo Matsudaira may assume the premiership.</p>
<p>[Remodeling Daily News Tokyo, 10th] After the Socialist Party's attempt to form a cabinet alone was rejected by Kijūrō Shidehara, the party convened a central standing committee meeting this afternoon. They decided to insist on forming the cabinet and invited fourteen people including Communist Party representatives Tokuda and Nosaka to meet with Shidehara. They demanded that Shidehara immediately recommend Katayama as Prime Minister. Shidehara merely said "I cannot answer," maintaining a composed demeanor as if he had a plan. Communist representative Tokuda became impatient, his forehead veins bulging as he slammed the table and angrily said, "Then how about we go together to negotiate before the Emperor!" Shidehara, seeing the situation was not good, excused himself to hold a cabinet meeting and slipped away. In the current situation, the Socialist Party's cabinet formation efforts have clearly stalled. According to observations from powerful sources, Shidehara may invite the leaders of the Social Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, the Cooperative Party, and even the Progressive Party tomorrow morning to hold consultations, excluding the Communist Party in an attempt to organize a so-called "National Unity Cabinet," and still recommend a Liberal Party representative as Prime Minister.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Growing Industrial Crisis; Wool Textile Industry Requests Layoffs; Matter of Great Importance Transferred to Labor-Management Arbitration Committee <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Workers in the city's wool textile industry previously demanded adjustments to their pay due to the rising cost of living. After the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from both labor and management to discuss the matter, the labor dispute was reasonably resolved. However, recently factories are experiencing shortages of raw materials, increased production costs, and the inability to compete with imported goods, resulting in a sharp decline in business and near-unsustainable conditions. Reluctantly, the industry association recently approached the Social Affairs Bureau requesting permission to lay off some workers, with the remaining employees working in shifts. The Social Affairs Bureau, considering the significance of this matter, acknowledges that it does not have the authority to prevent closures or cutbacks based on factory regulations. However, the resulting consequences would exacerbate the already complex social problems. For prudence's sake, it has been handed over to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for processing, and countermeasures are currently being considered.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Operating as Usual But Not Selling Tickets; British Tram Company Staged a Slowdown Yesterday; Labor Claims Treatment Has Not Improved; Social Affairs Bureau to Mediate Today <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The streetcar and trolleybus lines under the British Tram Company in this city staged a slowdown again yesterday, starting at 2:30 PM. People were allowed to ride without buying tickets, leading to doubled congestion. The Social Affairs Bureau will convene representatives from both sides today to conduct mediation. According to the workers, the reason for the slowdown is that management violated the plan previously agreed upon by the Social Affairs Bureau and has not complied with it. Although fares have been increased threefold, the workers' treatment has not improved. With the high cost of living, the average worker's monthly income of seventy to eighty thousand yuan is simply insufficient to maintain a living. This slowdown is a last resort, but to maintain transportation, they have decided to continue working as usual, without interrupting service.</p>
<p>Workers of Tobacco Company Petition</p>
<p>Over three hundred workers from the Wah Hwa Tobacco Company on Honan Road sent representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. They stated that since the end of last month, when the company temporarily suspended work due to machinery repairs, wages have not been paid during the suspension. The workers are unable to maintain their livelihoods and have requested a subsidy, which has been denied. Therefore, they are requesting mediation. On the same morning, workers from the Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Hongkou also sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for mediation, requesting the resumption of work.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Hu Wenyuan Assumes Office as Acting Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau; Expresses Optimism About Tax Revenue Prospects <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Hu Wenyuan, appointed as Acting Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau, assumed office at the bureau the afternoon before yesterday. Yesterday, he met with reporters from this newspaper and discussed the city's financial situation. He stated that when the municipal government took over, tax revenue was only tens of millions of yuan. After several months of efforts by Director Pu and his colleagues, it has reached over 2.8 billion yuan last month, which can cover regular expenses, but construction funds are still tight. After the central government returns business taxes, deed taxes, and land taxes to the local government, improvements can be gradually made. Mr. Hu stated that he is new to the position and needs to study the details of the city's finances further, but he is confident that the bureau staff are able to faithfully perform their duties. If all sectors outside the bureau can cooperate and management is improved, Shanghai's tax revenue will not fall short of expenses.</p>
<p>Currently, the financial community is unwilling to invest in local projects. Mr. Hu stated that the main reason is the national political situation, which has led to a decline in currency value. Not only is there no profit to be made after investment, but it is also easy to lose money, which ordinary private banks cannot afford. Therefore, idle funds are used for speculative loans to collect interest. Moreover, the salaries of civil servants are meager, making it impossible to maintain a living. This is also a problem for the whole country. Therefore, during this period of national instability, civil servants can only tighten their belts, maintain austerity, and overcome this difficulty together.</p>
<p>Acting Deputy Director Hu is 35 years old, a native of Wuxian, Jiangsu Province. He graduated from Soochow University with a Master's degree in Economics from Harvard University in the United States. He has served as a professor at Chongqing University, specialist and section chief of the Ministry of Finance, director of the Foreign Exchange Management Committee, specialist of the Ministry of Finance, and attended the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference as an expert in the summer of 1934.</p>

<p>Many French Nazi elements, suspected of endangering the Allies and continuing their secret work after Japan's surrender, were discovered by the U.S. Military War Crimes Commission and arrested last month. A total of nine were arrested in Shanghai and seven in Guangzhou. According to Colonel Younger, director of the U.S. Military War Crimes Investigation and Trial Commission, the U.S. military may try this group of Nazi war criminals in Shanghai within a month. Those arrested in Guangzhou will also be brought to Shanghai for trial at the same time. The U.S. military believes that the case is related to China, so it is cooperating with the Chinese authorities to collect evidence. The case may be tried separately by the U.S. military court and the Chinese war crimes tribunal in the future. The U.S. military has contacted Chief of Staff He Yingqin and Commander Zhang Fa-kui's troops and may first have the U.S. military conduct the trial, followed by the Chinese authorities, to determine the charges separately.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Suspicious Jeep Intercepted on Caoxi Road; Incident Occurred During Escort; U.S. Soldier Killed by Sniper; Rioter Shot Dead While Trying to Flee <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Joint Vehicle Inspection Office, currently stationed at the Racecourse, is jointly established by the U.S. Marine Corps Military Police and our country's military police. They send out three shifts daily to the Caoxi Road-Caobao Road intersection in western Shanghai to inspect passing vehicles. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, two U.S. military police officers, along with German soldier Deng Huiming, squad leader Ni Mingqi, and police officers No. 8728, 8731, and 8718, and a translator, went to Caoxi Road to relieve the previous shift. Around 12:00 PM, a rioter driving a jeep, bearing the permits Guohu No. 14025 U.S.N.N. and No. 3548, with a worn-out Guohu permit No. 15653 hanging behind, was heading south from the north. The U.S. military police approached for questioning and, finding his actions suspicious, detained both the person and the vehicle. At 4:00 PM, the team rotated back, with the U.S. military police driving the jeep driven by the rioter, with Deng Huiming sitting next to them, and the rioter sitting in the back row alone. The three police officers, squad leader Ni Mingqi, and the translator were traveling in front in a U.S. military police vehicle, Guohu No. 41160. Unexpectedly, when the two vehicles reached the entrance of the Cao Family Cemetery (about two hundred steps from the Caoxi Road intersection), the rioter suddenly reached out and sniped at the U.S. soldier driving. The U.S. soldier did not have time to dodge,</p>
<p>and was killed on the spot. The rioter then moved the dead U.S. soldier to the back, intending to drive the military vehicle, turned around, and tried to flee south. He was discovered by police officer No. 8728 in the vehicle in front, who fired three shots at the rioter. The rioter was wounded and fell from the vehicle, dying on the spot. The bullet entered from the left waist and exited from the right waist. A Browning pistol and a leather bag were dropped and taken away by the U.S. soldiers. The corpse appeared to be</p>
<p>in his twenties, wearing a suit, a yellow raincoat, white gloves, and black leather shoes, and wearing glasses. A "Shanghai Security Corps, Shanghai Central District Corps One Character No. 496" service card cloth sleeve, two gold rings, 13,000 yuan in customs gold units, 7,000 yuan in legal tender, a silver dollar, and a St. John's University diary were found on his person. The U.S. soldier's body was taken away by an ambulance. After the authorities took photos of the rioter's body, it was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to await inspection by the court today.</p>
<p>The murdered was sixteen years old. According to the post-incident investigation: The U.S. Navy soldier killed was named Anderson, and the rioter who died was named Chen Dailun, 16 years old, a student at St. John's University. His father, Chen Shixia, works at the customs office and serves as the captain of the first battalion of the Shanghai Security Corps in the central district. That night, after the incident, the Shanghai Joint Vehicle Inspection Office at the Racecourse immediately summoned Chen Shixia for questioning. According to him, the No. 14025 jeep driven by the deceased Dailun was indeed stolen, and the pistol he was carrying was found to belong to Yao Kangfu, a security corps leader. Dailun falsely claimed that he could obtain a gun license on behalf of Yao, so the gun was in his possession. Unexpectedly, he caused this disaster and deserved to die. After the incident, the U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters stationed in Shanghai immediately ordered a large number of military police, together with our military police, to heavily guard the area around the scene, blocking traffic until 8:00 PM, when the curfew was lifted and traffic was restored.</p>

The corps members also fired back and pursued them to Hongjiajiao, where one robber was captured on the spot. He confessed that his name was Yang Haifa, a local, who had been arrested for robbery and released last winter.</p>

Therefore, the committee does not plan to publish the addresses of those being enforced in future enforcement orders.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Public Trial of Traitor Tsai Pei: Once Praised "Co-Prosperity" and Sought "Friendship," Briefly Prominent, Now Humbling Himself, Submissively Quibbling, Hoping to Avoid Punishment; Wang Yongkang and Five Other Criminals Brought for Trial This Morning <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] During his period of resistance, Cai Pei, who served as the "Ambassador" of the puppet Nanjing National Government to Japan, vigorously sought "friendship" and loudly proclaimed "North Honor," once enjoying brief prominence, entered the court under public scrutiny at 2:30 PM yesterday to begin facing the sanctions of our laws. Traitor Cai is nearly old, his back slightly hunched, his head bald, and a short mustache remains on his upper lip. He wore a regular old gray-green long robe, revealing long black trouser legs beneath, and a pair of black serge cloth shoes. When he arrived in court, he wore a smile on his face, but his voice was low and slightly asthmatic when answering questions.</p>
<p>After Judge Liu inquired about his age, hometown, family size, and assets, he asked: "Have you ever joined the Kuomintang?" The answer was: "No." Subsequently, the prosecutor read the indictment, and Traitor Cai immediately stated that his participation in the puppet government was a forced scheme by Traitor Wang Jingwei, who pulled him in as Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, and that he was by no means "willingly collaborating." During his tenure as the puppet mayor of Nanjing, he claimed to have renovated the tomb of Sun Yat-sen and provided relief to the impoverished. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, when the Japanese army forcibly conscripted laborers in Nanjing, he also intervened to help them avoid conscription. When he was the head of the puppet Food Management Committee, he advocated for the reduction of military rice rations to resist Japan, but when he failed, he was transferred to Shanghai to hold a nominal position and reflect in seclusion. As for his appointment as the puppet ambassador to Japan, he originally did not want to go, but received instructions from Xu Mingcheng of the central government to "penetrate the tiger's den and spy on enemy intelligence." His actions in Tokyo were not entirely free and he seemed to be regarded as a spy, so he immediately returned to China and resigned.</p>
<p>Cai Pei Standing in Front of His Lawyer Giving Testimony</p>
<p>The presiding judge read aloud absurd remarks made by Traitor Cai in Japan, as reported in the newspapers, and asked him why. Traitor Cai actually said: "Speeches have been translated and re-translated, and I cannot be responsible for what is written in the newspapers." The presiding judge then asked: "Did you sign the 'Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty' during your time as the puppet ambassador to Japan?" Traitor Cai cunningly claimed: "No, this was negotiated by the puppet government authorities and the Japanese ambassador. They treated my agency as a decoration. Even after the fact, they did not inform me." The presiding judge then read out the speech given at the reception hosted by Aoki, the Greater East Asia Minister of Japan, on January 20, 1944, after the signing of the "treaty." Traitor Cai retorted: "Is this evidence not from the newspapers?" and turned to look around, saying, "What's in the newspaper is not accurate." This kind of quibbling was immediately ridiculed by the audience. Judge Liu then asked: "On January 9th last year, you sent 800,000 catties of sugar to the citizens of Tokyo on behalf of Chen Gongbo, is that correct?" He answered: "That was completely empty rhetoric." The audience burst into laughter. Subsequently, the lawyer for the defense submitted several documents. After the court debate and investigation were completed, the hearing was adjourned to a later date. Traitor Cai claimed to be ill. Judge Liu immediately allowed the prison doctor to examine him, and also granted his request to see his family. He met with his concubine and children, and Traitor Cai was exhausted, closing his eyes and opening his mouth, unable to speak coherently.</p>
<p>It is found that Traitor Cai is from Wuxi, 62 years old, residing at No. 4, Lane 395, Fuzhou Road. Before the war, he served as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior. After the July 7th Incident, he did not follow the government to the west, but in April 1940, he served as the puppet Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce. In June, he was transferred to the post of mayor of Nanjing. In January 1942, he became the Chairman of the Puppet Food Management Committee. In March, he became a member of the Relief Committee of the Puppet Executive Yuan. In December, he was appointed as a political advisor to the puppet National Government. In May 1943, he served as the puppet ambassador to Japan, where he discussed peace with enemy leaders Konoe Fumimaro and others several times. After returning to China from Japan in May 1945, he served as a member of the puppet National Government Committee and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Nanjing City Bank. After the victory, he was arrested by the Shanghai office of the Military Intelligence Bureau and brought to justice. The Higher Procuratorate's investigation confirmed that his actions constituted a violation of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed in accordance with the law. Furthermore, the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court tried four traitor cases yesterday morning, and all were adjourned to a later date. Details are listed below.</p>
<p>Yuan Jufan is from Anhui, 44 years old, residing at Room 1, No. 1396, Yuyuan Road. After graduating from Nanyang Medical University in 1927, he practiced medicine in Shanghai. In August 1939, he sought refuge in the puppet government and served as a medical officer at the Municipal Hospital of the "Great Way Municipal Government." On July 31, 1943, when the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government took over the concessions and merged Districts 18 and 2, he served as the Director of the Health Department of the two districts. In June 1944, he was promoted to Counselor of the puppet Municipal Government. In July 1945, he was further promoted to Director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau. According to his statement: because his brothers were brutally murdered by the communists, his family had an elderly mother, and living conditions were difficult, his collaboration was out of necessity, and the positions he held were all beneficial to the people.</p>
<p>Tan Zhongjiang, from Hunan, is the nephew of Tan Yankai, 33 years old, residing at No. 581, Seymour Road. His father and brother were lifelong friends with Traitor Wang Jingwei, so in July 1941, he was summoned by Wang Jingwei to serve as a secretary of the Puppet Executive Yuan with a simplified appointment. In the spring of 1942, he resigned and came to Shanghai to work at the Litai Yarn Factory in Taicang.

If they are only nominally so, they should be strictly rectified. (2) The school spirit of each school, whether it is pure and good, should be strictly noted; and the general atmosphere of respecting teachers and valuing education should be promoted. (3) Whether local officials have any illegal activities in handling education funds, and whether the funds are used specifically for the purpose, should be strictly investigated. The organization and situation of local education funds and properties should be given more guidance to make it sound. (4) Attention should be paid to whether the county magistrate attaches importance to education, and how the promotion and facilities of education laws and regulations are, as a reference for assessment. (5) The "National Education Promotion Plan" promulgated earlier is of great importance to the universal development of national education in this province. How the counties are promoting it should be carefully investigated, and attention should be paid to whether there are any difficulties in promoting it, so as to make improvements.</p>

Decorative gold was 170,000, silver bullion was 1,700, and silver dollars were selling at 1,080 yuan. The private exchange rate was calm, with interest rates ranging from 1.7 to 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were stable, with little special activity. There was no shortage of demand from Chinese businesses and industries. A certain American bank continued to release physical currency, in significant amounts, but because most of it was dirty and old, the currency exchange industry's reserves did not ease, and the process remained tight. The opening price in the morning was 2,190 yuan, after which it fluctuated in a short range between 2,180 yuan and 2,200 yuan, with no change until noon. The afternoon remained stable, and the closing price was similar to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were still affected by the falling Hong Kong exchange rate, falling below 390 yuan at the lowest point before stabilizing slightly. The closing price was also flat, but there were more sellers than buyers. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 410 yuan, and the Robbie was 515 yuan, with supply exceeding demand. The US exchange rate remained flat.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Yarn Sales Stagnant; Spot Cotton Trading Quite Active <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market lacked vitality. The Green Jin and Yue gangs did not take action, and sales to customers became sluggish. Only the Jing, Wu, and Min gangs absorbed a small amount, but the demand was limited, and they could not revitalize the declining market. The prices of various yarns fell by about 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. There were still not many spot goods of small and medium-sized yarns. At noon, the Textile and Construction Company opened yarn as usual, with prices similar to the previous period. However, 42-count double-strand yarn was not listed, so the price of this type of yarn rose by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan at the afternoon tea party.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York's American cotton telegram reported an increase of 12 to 22 points. The near-term price was US$27.52, and the forward price was US$27.82. There was no market for Middling cotton. Spot cotton trading in Shanghai was active. The Textile and Construction Company purchased a total of 5,663 bales of Middling, Brazilian, Flower Island, and Uruguay brands. Shenxin No. 1 Factory purchased 200 bales of Middling, and the price was higher than the previous day.</p>

<p>According to Chaoshan gang Hong Kong exporters, Shantou's rice supply has always relied on Siam and Vietnam. Since the two places restricted exports, Shantou's rice once rose to 140,000 yuan per dan, and flour also rose to 20,000 yuan per bag due to the ban on exports from Shanghai. Recently, local merchants have appealed to the Vietnamese authorities to lift the ban. It is reported that the Vietnamese authorities have agreed to ship a small amount of rice to Shantou. The rice price has fallen back to 60,000 yuan per dan, and the flour price has also fallen back to around 20,000 yuan per bag.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] The US State Department announced yesterday that it has established a British-American committee to help the Siamese government increase rice production and expedite the transportation of rice to India and other areas in the Far East that urgently need food.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] According to "Newsweek" magazine, the export industry of Burmese rice and hemp wood is difficult to recover for a while due to the lack of elephants and water buffaloes. It is said that of the 6,000 elephants that had been trained to transport timber, 4,000 died or disappeared in the jungle during the Japanese occupation.</p>
<h3 id="e100">A Small Number of Major Players Manipulate; Government Bonds Rise in a Straight Line; The Stock Market Also Gradually Stabilizes <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Government bonds were not exempt from a fluctuating trend. In general, people overly emphasized the monthly drawing of lots for principal repayment. Yesterday, the fear of winning the lottery slightly subsided. In fact, the rise and fall of the bond market have long deviated from common sense. A few so-called major government bond players shared similar interests, and a small amount of speculative capital followed their lead blindly. Tongbing rose from the opening price of 6,250 yuan all the way to 7,300 yuan, an increase of 1,150 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Jiayi and Yi also followed suit, rising by 650 yuan after struggling for a while. Dingzhong rose by 700 yuan, and Wuzhong rose by 750 yuan. Chinese stocks struggled fiercely. Although the situation improved slightly, speculative capital was still cautious and did not dare to participate in the rise. The process rose and fell repeatedly, but the trading range gradually narrowed, and the storm was relatively calm. The prices of various stocks were weaker in the middle of the day, but the opening and closing prices were more stable. Rongfeng made a major announcement, with 20 major joint short-selling players using 95 taels of gold to secure a certain number at a building on Central Road as the command center, attracting loyal followers of the stock market. The market price continued to advance, and the closing price was slightly higher for Yongsha and Meiya compared to the previous closing price. Rongfeng continued to rise by 10%. The gains and losses of the three small leading stocks were minimal, and the rest were relatively stable. In the afternoon, the prices of various stocks were still raised under encouragement. Foreign stocks also followed Chinese stocks and tended to stabilize, but the momentum was not strong. Yisha briefly reached a high of 14,300 yuan before turning around. The closing price was slightly lower for Yeguang and Huidefeng compared to the previous closing price, and the rest rebounded slightly.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat. The association's marked price for medium-grade white sugar was 57,500 yuan, a slight increase of 500 yuan. The numbered price for medium-grade sugar with tax was 56,500 yuan, ordinary Diaoqing was 45,000 yuan, and inferior Qing was 43,000 yuan. The previous day's tender sale of sugar resulted in the sale of 660 packages of Che Bai honey at 60,000 yuan, 178 packages of raw sugar at 52,000 yuan, and 100 packages of inferior Che Bai (competitively bid) at 63,000 yuan, 50 bags of 22nd grade white sugar at 64,000 yuan, and 70 packages of inferior 3.5 Che Bai at 57,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the opening price of Youguang ren silk on the 120th Tianqiao was 1.26 million yuan. Later, upon hearing the news that silk factories were reopening, sentiment was boosted, and the price revolved upward to 1.33 million yuan at the close. In the afternoon, it rose another 10,000 yuan, resulting in an increase of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other numbered goods all rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The purchasing price of 80-point evenness factory silk by Dachang was 2.34 million yuan. The transaction of user silk was bleak, and the price of ordinary goods was called up by 50,000 yuan. Meiya's silk goods were relatively firm, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Dacheng's ge ten 縐 was quite weak, with a selling price of 3,680 yuan per yard.</p>

<p>The Yongli Tanggu Soda Ash Factory has returned to its pre-war state, producing 80 to 100 tons of 99-degree soda ash per day. Its quality is no less than that of imported products. The current market price of British Merchant Bunemen's Moon Brand soda ash is 50,000 yuan per bag, while Yongli's soda ash is only sold for 35,000 yuan. The factory also originally produced caustic soda, but the electrolysis project is very complicated and has not yet been started. The outlets for soda ash are the production of old soda ash, glass, enamel, and other industrial raw materials.</p>
<p>Also, Yongli's Nanjing Ammonium Sulfate Factory will be able to start production as soon as the coal transportation problem is solved. Before the war, British Merchant Bunemen's ammonium sulfate fertilizer had the largest sales in China. After the war, the price of alkali and fertilizer sold by Bunemen not only decreased but was also higher than that of American goods. If Yongli Company can make its best efforts, then domestic alkali and fertilizer can replace it.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] Sweden, Norway, and Finland are pulp exporting countries. Whether American paper mills can produce 18 million tons of paper this year according to plan depends on the pulp supply from these countries. According to industry estimates, the pulp supply from Canada next year is expected to be equal to or even exceed the previous year, reaching a total of 1.25 million tons. The amount of pulp supplied by Sweden and Finland is still unknown. According to paper mill estimates, Sweden can supply 800,000 to 900,000 tons of pulp to the United States this year, but the United States must raise the price limit. Of the 18 million tons of paper produced this year, 80% of the raw materials are pulp and 30% are waste paper. Last year, the United States imported about 1.7 million tons of pulp, of which 1.1 million tons came from Canada and 600,000 tons came from Sweden. The United States produced 11.1 million tons of pulp. The proposal to jointly increase the prices of imported and domestic pulp by 10% has recently been rejected by the Price Management Bureau. The current price per ton ranges from US$50 to US$80, and the price of special-grade pulp is as high as US$140 per ton.</p>

<p>A reporter from the United Credit Reporting Agency inquired about the overview of cotton cloth export trade with Mr. Pan Shihao, the executive director of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association. According to him, before the war, Chinese cotton cloth sold well in various parts of the Nanyang Islands, with light-colored thin yarn cloth and printed cloth being the main products. Therefore, China formed a tripartite situation with Britain and Japan in the cotton cloth market of Nanyang. After the war, Japan's cotton cloth was temporarily difficult to export. The British government planned to build a 10 million-spindle spinning machine in India in an attempt to monopolize the Nanyang cotton cloth market. At present, China has not yet fully recovered, and transportation is not smooth, so it is difficult to talk about cotton cloth exports for a while. It is hoped that the Textile and Construction Company, which leads the national cotton spinning industry, can foresee this and avoid losing the Nanyang market.</p>

<p>Since the arrival of the National Army in Shanghai, Mobil Oil and other companies have shipped large quantities of surplus kerosene from oil-producing areas in California, Texas, and New Jersey to China (due to limited sales in those countries during World War II), amounting to more than 200,000 tons. Therefore, the market is currently flooded with bulk kerosene, causing black market prices to plummet. It is reported that the Texaco gas stations sold by American merchants have no restrictions, canceling the previous limit of one jin per person and no need to queue to buy. Moreover, this kerosene will continue to be shipped from the United States to Shanghai, and the prices of kerosene and other fuels are expected to plummet soon.</p>

<p>In the coal market, the price of white coal screened chunks had been supported by major players, but due to sluggish actual sales, dealers and smallholders were forced to sell at low prices due to financial constraints, so the price fell back again.

If there are large shipments, further negotiations are possible.</p>

<p>The cotton cloth market, which had been stalled for many days, resumed normal trading between companies yesterday, but public sentiment remained extremely indignant. The association held a meeting in the afternoon to discuss the establishment of a sales office promoted and organized by the association to liaise with the Textile and Construction Company, expressing support for the proposal. However, the issue of personnel selection was given great importance.</p>
<p>Reorganization Method</p>
<p>It is reported that members will begin to formulate a plan, and then hold meetings in groups to discuss it publicly. They will also submit concrete methods for the procedures of the Textile and Construction Company directly opening goods to the Textile and Construction authorities for adoption. If the progress is smooth, it is hoped that opening goods to the Textile and Construction Company will resume next week. The cessation of activities of the sales offices organized by the three major companies, Baodaxiang, etc., has been accepted by the three major companies and the Textile and Construction authorities. However, how to reorganize to merge with the large organization promoted by the association is still under negotiation. The remaining yarn and cloth of the Pseudo-Merchant Association has been submitted by the Cotton Cloth, Cotton Yarn, and Dyeing and Weaving Three Industry Association to the Textile and Construction Company, and also presented to the Processing Bureau, requesting to stop the sale, pending the final reasonable disposal. According to the person in charge of the association, the sales office organized by the Textile and Construction Company should have been supported, but it is regrettable that it failed to accommodate the opinions of most of the industry in advance, which caused dissatisfaction. The following is a letter from Saidaxiang, etc., expressing their willingness to cancel the sales office, and a letter from the Three Associations requesting to stop the sale of the remaining yarn and cloth of the Pseudo-Merchant Association to the Manager of Textile and Construction Company.</p>
<p>Letter from the Three Associations</p>
<p>Dear Sirs, Regarding the case of our Association, etc., requesting the return of the remaining yarn and cloth transferred by the Pseudo-Merchant Association, there have been repeated changes over the months, and the processing authorities have repeatedly changed their approvals. The local newspapers have repeatedly reported on the progress of this case, which we trust you are aware of. We previously received a reply stating that when the bid price was paid, the price of gold soared, and merchants no longer suffered losses. However, the bid price was actually very small, and the price increase was far from making up for the losses. Furthermore, one-quarter of the payment has not yet been received. Seven or eight out of ten companies have gone bankrupt and closed down, and some have even become brokers, relying on small profits to make a living. The situation is miserable and difficult to describe. Such measures by the Bureau make it difficult for the victims to feel satisfied. Therefore, we have filed an administrative lawsuit with the Executive Yuan, seeking to return the remaining yarn and cloth in accordance with the Zhu-led payment portion. While this lawsuit is still pending, the Bureau has decided that this yarn and cloth is government property and entrusted it to your company for sale by tender. The news spread, causing the industry to reach the point of unbearable, ultimately leading to a storm of strikes and protests. In addition to working hard to persuade them to resume business first and wait for a reasonable solution, our Association, etc., hereby inform you for your information and request that the aforementioned yarn and cloth be suspended from tendering before the lawsuit is finalized. At the same time, we also hope that you will forward it for review, so as to avoid increasing disputes. We are counting on you. Best regards, To China Textile Construction Company.</p>
<p>Letter from the Three Major Companies</p>
<p>We have received your letter No. Cai Zi 103 with respect. After investigation, we have been entrusted by China Textile and Weaving Construction Company to establish a sales office to promote a portion of the various cloths produced by the company, which has caused dissatisfaction among various industries. In order to respect the opinions of various industries, we have decided to voluntarily stop undertaking and request the Textile and Construction Company to terminate the contract. We deeply regret that we did not seek the consent of your Association in advance. We hereby reply to your letter and ask that you convey this to various industries.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The American-owned Fu Lai Steamship Company's freighters William B. Phillips, Mitchell, Hiran L. Goth, and G. Land Willard (transliterations), four freighters specializing in transporting coal between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao, with the Hiran L. Goth and William B. Phillips,</p>
<p>arrived in Shanghai from Qinhuangdao the day before yesterday. Hiran L. Goth carried 9,500 tons of coal, docking at the Yi Tai Dian Bei Pier for unloading. William B. Phillips also transported 10,000 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao and is currently docked at the Mitsui Wharf for unloading. Two other freighters are en route to Shanghai. The aforementioned four American freighters regularly transport coal between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao.</p>
<p>The labor dispute at the Hongji Coal Mine in Annam that occurred last week has now been resolved. The coal industry has received a telegram stating that two giant freighters have been loaded with white coal dust from that area en route to Shanghai. One is the Norwegian freighter Rostum, carrying 5,600 tons of white coal dust, and the other is the British freighter Handamare, carrying 7,100 tons of white coal dust to Shanghai, scheduled to arrive tomorrow.</p>

<p>Zhang, the manager of Jun Chang Cotton Company, stated that orders for American cotton have decreased in the past two months. Previous orders from this city can be delivered by the end of June. Currently, because American cotton prices are slightly higher than Indian cotton, most cotton companies are placing orders with India.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Zhejiang Province Sericulture Enters Transformation Period: New Silk Emerges Three Days After Start of Summer <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 7th Day, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Whether we travel from Shanghai to Hangzhou by train, car, or boat, we can see mulberry groves on both sides of the road, especially in the mid-spring weather, the mulberry leaves are lush and green and lovely. Furthermore, if we take the Hangjiang Railway from Hangzhou, or take the Zhegan Road train through Zhuji, Xiaoshan and other places, we can also see a row of neat mulberry trees. If you go to Yuhang, it is even more of a wilderness of mulberry groves. This is the famous silk-producing area of Zhejiang, where almost every farming family makes sericulture their business. Even urban families raise one or two silkworm egg sheets to forecast this year's wealth.</p>
<p>Now is a Great Opportunity for Silk to Rise</p>
<p>In the past, Zhejiang's silk was dumped abroad, but later Japan caught up, improving mulberry trees, silkworm breeds, sericulture, and cocoon drying. The world silk market was taken over by Japan. Now that Japan is busy with its domestic reorganization, it is the time for our silk to rise. I still remember when we studied some wild silkworms in the Great Rear Area, but to this day, there has not been much success. Now that the lost territory has been recovered and the strong enemy has been defeated, if we do not seek development, when will we wait?</p>
<p>According to the survey statistics in the "Zhejiang Chronicle" of the "China Industrial Gazette" of the Ministry of Industry's International Trade Bureau in 1933, in the old Hangjiahu area north of the Qiantang River and south of Lake Tai, on a provincial scale: the area of mulberry fields is 2,658,193 mu, the annual output of mulberry leaves is 18,366,410 dan, the number of silkworm farming households is 800,4,352, the annual output of improved silkworm cocoons is 326,400 dan, the output of native silkworm cocoons is 761,600 dan, the output of factory silk is 5,080 dan, the output of native silk is 85,260 dan, and the output of silk fabrics is 300,000 bolts. This number is considerable. Now, if we operate well, we will definitely have many methods. However, the problem we should pay attention to now is that silkworm farmers use high-interest loans for sericulture, resulting in the silkworm farmers still being completely impoverished. Native breeds are more common than improved breeds, and the outlet and handling methods for native breeds still need to be resolved.</p>
<p>China Silk Company Guides Sericulture</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the state-owned China Silk Company Zhejiang Branch, they will absolutely not seize profits from the people, nor will they compete with the people for power. They are to guide the development of the sericulture industry. 300,000 sheets of improved silkworm eggs have already been allocated by them to the Zhejiang Sericulture Improvement Committee of the Construction Department, then allocated by the Improvement Committee to the Sericulture Improvement Institutes of various counties, then allocated to the Sericulture Improvement Organizations of various townships, and then distributed to the farmers. It is said that the price of improved silkworm eggs this year is as high as 12,000 yuan per sheet, but the China Silk Company is allocating them for only 2,000 yuan. If the real farmers can obtain loans at this price, it would be a cause for celebration. According to what the reporter learned: the Cooperative Business Administration is responsible for lending improved silkworm eggs only to Jiaxing, Chongde, Haining, Zhuji, Xiaoshan, Hangxian, Deqing, and other seven counties, because the cooperative organizations in these seven counties are sound and can lend directly to the people. However, Gu Dayi, the director of the Haining Seawall Disaster Relief Committee, caught someone raising the price of improved silkworm eggs and selling them to farmers. Therefore, whether the other counties can truly still lend to the farmers at 2,000 yuan remains to be investigated by people who can truly work in rural areas. The reporter once asked the person in charge of the Zhejiang Company of the China Silk Company whether the price of silkworm eggs would be increased for sale, and he said he could not guarantee it.</p>
<p>Silkworm Farmers Cannot Withstand High-Interest Loans</p>
<p>After the improved breeds are loaned, the 2,000 yuan price must be paid immediately. There is also a loan for sericulture, 3,000 yuan per household, which is lent directly by the Farmers Bank. Before the war, Zhejiang's improved and native silkworm eggs always exceeded one million sheets. Now, if we assume that it is discounted by 30%, then there should be 700,000 sheets. In addition to the 300,000 sheets of improved breeds, there are also 400,000 sheets of native breeds. Because the state-owned China Silk Company believes that native silkworm silk does not meet export standards, it leaves it to its own devices, does not lend, and does not provide guidance. Will the 321,732 silkworm farming households be subject to the exploitation of high-interest loans? This is a current problem.</p>
<p>Native Silk Factories Mystify the Situation</p>
<p>The season has arrived at "Start of Summer". "New silk emerges three days after the Start of Summer" is a common saying among sericulturists. Then the native silkworm silk will enter the market, while the improved breeds will be later. It is said that they will not go up the mountain to make cocoons until after the 15th of this month. The China Silk Company uses political power to prohibit silk factories from opening cocoon shops, which can be said to prevent the exploitation of intermediate cocoon merchants, which is correct. Moreover, the Zhejiang Branch has negotiated a 200 million yuan loan with silk factories to set up cocoon shops to collect cocoons. Recently, news has emerged that a Shanghai banking group has also loaned 2 million yuan to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces to collect cocoons. However, the China Silk Company wants cocoons from improved breeds, not cocoons from native breeds. Therefore, these many loans are also loaned to silk factories and cocoon shops that specialize in collecting cocoons from improved breeds. And the native silkworm farmers cannot find places to sell their cocoons. In the past, there were many cocoon shops run by surplus cocoon merchants that could collect them, but now the surplus cocoon merchants have been abolished. Occasionally, a few silk factories collect them, but the prices must not be very high. And the native silkworm farmers who have neither obtained improved silkworm eggs nor obtained sericulture loans, what will they do? The reporter once asked the person in charge of the Zhejiang Silk Company about this matter. He said: Don't worry about them, they have their own ways. In the past, native silk per 100 taels once fell to 50,000 yuan, but now it has risen to 90,000 yuan, but this is the mystification of the native silk factories to lure farmers to sell. Once there are too many seeking to sell, it will plummet again. The farmers will always fall for this trick. I think watching most of the silkworm farmers be tricked and suffer losses is ultimately not a good strategy.</p>
<p>Eliminate the Suffering of Native Silk Silkworm Farmers</p>
<p>After the silk factories and cocoon shops collect the cocoons and reel the silk, they can entrust the China Silk Company to sell them abroad. If they do not go through the China Silk Company, they can also do so, but they must have the silk appraised by the company beforehand. Currently, the export market for improved silkworm silk has reached US$12.5 per pound, which is of course much stronger than native silk. The outlet for native silk is of course to weave silk fabrics. Before the war, silk fabrics were sold to Northeast China and Southeast Asia. Now, Northeast China is in chaos, and Southeast Asia is not yet stable. The outlet for native silk is only to weave silk fabrics and sell them cheaply. Because silk fabrics are cheap, the price of native silk will definitely decline.</p>
<p>The China Silk Company has also established a demonstration zone in Jiaxing and on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to cultivate mulberry trees, raise silkworms, dry cocoons, and reel silk. The Cooperative Business Administration is also holding cooperative cocoon drying in Jiaxing and other places. However, it is best to call on the native silkworm farmers to visit and learn a lot from these many businesses. At the same time, it is necessary to produce a large number of improved silkworm eggs in order to avoid the suffering of native silkworm farmers.</p>
<p>[Silkworm Treasures] The ones that need a deep sleep are getting it, the ones climbing the mountains are already there, and the ones that are about to sleep are getting ready. We do not want there to be a difference between "foreign treasures" and "native treasures" among the equally treated farmers. We want to see the "native treasures" also receive the benefits of improvement.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Current Lifestyle in Britain <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Our Editorial Office</p>
<p>Although the clouds of war over Britain have dissipated for a year, the British feel that peaceful days are still very difficult, and in some ways even more difficult than before. During the war, people were content with less food rations, worn clothes, lack of housing, and many restrictions on life, but the current tension seems to make the British, who are known for their patience, a little impatient.</p>
<p>Like other European countries, Britain's most difficult problem to solve is food and housing. Since taking office last summer, the Labour government has encountered various difficulties, but the most unpopular thing to date is that it had to reduce its already meager food rations again due to the global food shortage not long ago. This sudden news seemed to shock British housewives to the point of breathlessness.</p>
<p>Egg Powder Shortage Makes Faces Gloomy</p>
<p>On the morning when Sir Smith announced that there would be no more egg powder on the market, passers-by on the streets all wore gloomy faces, reminiscent of the days when news from the front lines during the war was not going well. We remember that when this news was announced, the Security Council was fiercely debating the issue of British troops stationed in Greece, but nine out of ten newspapers paid attention to the news of egg powder, just as they paid attention to the great debate between Bevin and Vyshinsky. Although the Ministry of Food talked a lot about how cakes and puddings without eggs are just as good as those with eggs, and even hens can't tell the difference, with fresh eggs as precious as ostrich eggs, no woman would believe that the shortage of egg powder is not a major misfortune.</p>
<p>Although most people hoped that peace could loosen the belts that had been tightened for a long time, they are now convinced that these belts must be tightened even more than before. Bread is also in danger of becoming a problem. The unrationed bread that used to look like small hills in food stores is no longer visible. Every kitchen must save as much as possible, just as when German submarines were lurking in British ports.</p>
<p>All Rationed Goods Show a Declining Trend</p>
<p>The total fat ration, including butter, margarine, and lard, has been reduced to seven ounces per week, and the government has revealed ominous hints about the supply of sugar. The meat ration remains at one shilling and two pence (less than 25 US cents) per week, one-seventh of which must be taken in canned corned beef. The tea ration is two and a half ounces, only half an ounce more than in November 1944. On the other hand, the bacon ration was six ounces per week during the emergency period in 1944, but now it is only three ounces. Even the points for buying sundries such as canned food, dried fruit, fruit juice, and grains have been reduced from 24 points per month to 20 points. According to the scoring method, a can of fruit juice costs 16 points, and a can of meat costs 16 to 24 points, so it is not difficult to imagine the difficulty of choosing a few luxuries in the family. The reality is too far from the British imagined state of enjoying the blessings of peace while smoking a pipe. According to recent chemical analysis, the average Briton received 2,923 calories of food per day in 1944, but only 2,750 calories in 1945.</p>
<p>Food is Too Monotonous, Every Meal is Similar</p>
<p>Britain is a bit luckier than many other European countries. The food people get is enough to sustain life, but the unusual monotony of the food, the excessive amount of starch, and the lack of fresh fruit and desserts are beginning to make people impatient. In pubs, no matter how high you pay, this meal feels "almost" the same as the last meal. In cheaper places, there are many dishes on the menu, but in reality, they are just old tunes like bread and sausage, just with better-sounding names.</p>
<p>The menus in London restaurants are even more magnificent and look beautiful, but they taste very bland. Most of the cold dishes are chopped vegetables, and sometimes there may be roast meat, but it is often crossed out on the menu when you visit.</p>
<p>For people who cannot eat out, the problem is even more difficult. Old people who live solely on rationed food are almost in danger of approaching the starvation line. British women are struggling with nothing to put on the table to feed their hungry families three meals a day.</p>
<p>Buying Fish Requires Queuing, Which is Frustrating</p>
<p>Eating fish is one solution, but to buy fish, you have to queue for a long time, which is frustrating. In the eyes of housewives, today's cattle and sheep seem to be born without livers and kidneys, because it is not easy to see their traces in butcher shops. Chickens and any kind of poultry cannot be bought. Last year's apple harvest in Britain was not good, and there has been no fresh fruit in fruit stores since autumn. Occasionally there are a few oranges, but buying them requires deduction of ration points. In addition, there was a small batch of bananas that recently arrived. The surprise of the British when they saw bananas they hadn't seen for many years shows how tired they are of the monotony of their daily food. Mothers always glow when they buy bananas from the grocery store, as if they picked them from the banana tree themselves.</p>
<p>Housing Offices are Crowded with People Looking for Housing</p>
<p>In addition to being worried about food, Londoners are also worried about housing. In London, as in other bombed cities in Britain, finding a house to shelter from the wind and rain is a very tricky problem.</p>
<p>According to officials in charge of housing issues, the current situation is worse than when the Germans carried out blitzkrieg air raids. Because during times of tension, most of the population evacuated to the countryside, and the people who enlisted went to other places, so there was always a place to sleep. Now the evacuees have returned, the children have also returned, the shelters have been closed, and although the demobilization of the army can increase the number of construction workers, the line of applicants for housing is also increasing every day. Mobile housing is indeed available, but in the general situation of housing shortage, it is just a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>For example, in London's poor Comberwell district, out of the 75,000 houses in the entire district, only 400 were not bombed and were completely undamaged. In the local housing offices, there are always many people sitting every day, waiting to meet with the person in charge, hoping to get a place to live.</p>
<p>Modest Families Still Have Old Furnishings</p>
<p>Many modest British families still have very old furnishings and have little way to decorate them more beautifully. The maximum limit for house repair expenses is still 100 pounds (equivalent to a little more than 400 US dollars). Additional amounts can only be obtained for absolutely necessary repairs. In the early spring sunshine, London still looks very dilapidated. The situation indoors is almost the same. Whether cotton or wool fabrics are rationed. No woman can find a way to replace the sofa with a new spring cover. The linen decorations on food cabinets and the like have been patched and repaired again and again in most homes. Bath towels were very large when they were new, but now they have been cut to the size of handkerchiefs. The problem of porcelain is easier to solve, but the quality is not good. Most of them are plain, heavy things. Staffordshire porcelain with large red roses, Sparta tea sets, and blue and white Wedgwood porcelain are all famous British products, but now they are only for export to reduce the strain on the national treasury.</p>
<p>The beautiful hats that women cannot live without are not subject to rationing restrictions, but they find it most difficult to buy underwear, socks, and shoes. Buying shoes is even more difficult. Although there are many stocks in the windows of shoe stores, a closer look reveals a small sign below: "This is a sample and is not for sale." Occasionally, a batch of goods is sold in shoe stores, but it is immediately bought up by women in line. British leather goods were very famous before the war, but the goods on the domestic market are very poor. Most shoe stores have changed to repairing shoes. The most headache for mothers is children's shoes. It is not easy to buy them. If you offer a lower price, you may sometimes buy things made of oilcloth and cardboard that break after wearing them for a short time.</p>
<p>Better Day by Day, National Belief is Stronger</p>
<p>The general life of the British is so difficult and serious, so a slight relaxation of restrictions has a good impact on the spirit of the people. Now, housewives can buy good-quality frying pans. Although wooden combs cannot be bought except from black market vendors, nail polish can be bought in stores. It is said that the wartime restrictions on women's clothing will also be lifted soon. Pockets, buttons, and pleats can be freely renewed. For the long-suffering British people, this kind of reduction in wartime restrictions is of course greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>In a typical British home in peacetime, life is not necessarily easy, but it is very stable. There are indeed many difficult things, but they all know that the situation will improve day by day. In the past, the British had absolute faith in the victory of the Battle of Britain, and this time their faith is still as firm. (Translated from the April issue of Collier's magazine)</p>
<p>Artificial Rubber Tires</p>
<p>A new type of artificial rubber tire is said to be as good as a natural rubber military tire. It is made from the government's special CR-S-10 artificial rubber. The thing that makes the rubber into a latex here is not fatty acid but resin, which is a very important factor. It makes the tire durable, the temperature does not rise easily when rotating, and it has greater power to reduce the rumble of the wheels.</p>
<p>Another factor is the design of the tire form. The part that touches the ground is larger than ordinary tires, which makes it roll more smoothly on the road. This is a big step forward. The increase in the contact surface can make the car body more stable, the weight distribution more even, and reduce the drag of the contact surface. (US News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e116">New Problems Arise After Restoration of Civil Administration: Reorganization of Hong Kong's Political System <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Our Hong Kong Telegraph Dispatch at 7 PM, Lin Youlan</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st: It is announced here today that the system of the British colony of Hong Kong will be amended as soon as possible on a more liberal basis. The British government is currently considering ways to allow Hong Kong residents, like those in other colonies, to assume a more important role in handling their own affairs. The British government has instructed the Governor of Hong Kong to consult with all sectors of society, study this entire issue, and submit a report as early as possible before the end of this year.</p>
<p>On the same day that the above telegram was sent from London, Hong Kong officially restored civil administration, which had been interrupted since Christmas 1941. The new Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Mark Young, arrived in Hong Kong by plane from England. At 10 AM on the 1st, an inauguration ceremony was held at the Governor's residence. Lieutenant General Sir Harcourt Butler, the former Governor of the military government of Hong Kong, read out the first proclamation abolishing the military government and lowered the flag before leaving. In past dispatches, this reporter has reported on the situation in Hong Kong on the eve of the restoration of civil administration and the brief history of the new Governor, Sir Mark Young. Now, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the issue of reorganizing Hong Kong's political system.</p>
<p>New Governor Sir Mark Young Announces Hong Kong Autonomy Plan</p>
<p>In his inaugural address, Sir Mark Young also mentioned a "plan to develop self-government for the people of Hong Kong," saying, "I dare say this" announcement "will satisfy all the people of Hong Kong." This is the "gift" that Sir Mark Young, "after experiencing the painful imprisonment under the Japanese army" (see Lieutenant General Sir Harcourt Butler's address), brought to the people of Hong Kong, and it is also the first step in his administrative plan. No wonder that the next day after the announcement, the Chinese and Western newspapers in Hong Kong published this startling news with the most important space.</p>
<p>The issue of Hong Kong's autonomy is not entirely new. In March of this year, the English-language "South China Morning Post" of Hong Kong published an article by Mrs. Stowe, wife of the former Hong Kong Colonial Secretary Sir Atholl MacGregor, in the United Kingdom, discussing Hong Kong's future. This enlightened British figure, who had learned from the Pacific War, told people that "British people returning to Hong Kong to carry out municipal administration in the future should treat the Chinese people with an attitude of friendship and understanding." She also said, "Hong Kong should no longer adopt power politics, and racial discrimination should be abolished, and unequal treatment and exploitation should be ended." She listed the "hopes" of Chinese people residing in Hong Kong as suggestions: "Expand the administrative and legislative bodies, allow Chinese people to participate, and establish a self-governing municipal council in Hong Kong, with councilors elected by the legal population."</p>
<p>"Simple Simon's" Counterattack Met with Rebuttals from "Local Youths"</p>
<p>After Mrs. Stowe's article was published in the South China Morning Post, it sparked a debate. A person named "Simple Simon" submitted a letter to the newspaper, presenting a direct objection, arguing that ordinary Hong Kong people would only be opportunistic and selfish, and did not have the moral values of serving the public, and were not yet qualified to talk about autonomy. "Simple Simon's" words were attacked by "A Hong Konger," "Local Youth," and "Local Youngster." After a while, the debate slowly subsided. Unexpectedly, Sir Mark Young traveled from afar and revealed to the residents of Hong Kong a new plan to reorganize Hong Kong's political system. Within three days, that "Simple Simon" again spewed nonsense in the South China Morning Post, alarmingly opposing Hong Kong's autonomy. He said that his remarks were "based on facts. After the people of Hong Kong participate in politics, I can foresee days of unprecedented corruption, racial discrimination, injustice, and struggle." He also said, "The vast majority of Hong Kong people belong to other ethnic groups. These people are still loyal to the United Kingdom because their motherland and the United Kingdom have not yet had disputes." Therefore, he specifically requested the British government to give this issue more consideration. Those absurd words of "Simple Simon" are truly "simple." Before Sir Mark Young came to Hong Kong, he spent countless hours "in London planning future measures with the British government, especially related to the issue of Hong Kong's autonomy" (see Lieutenant General Sir Harcourt Butler's address). Could it be that the minds of those Colonial Office officials are not as good as "Simple Simon's"?...</p>
<p>Rescuing This Wounded Region, Laying the Foundation for Cooperation Between China and Britain</p>
<p>Regardless of the views of the die-hard British or the enlightened British, there is only one way to "rescue this wounded region" and "lay the foundation for friendly cooperation between China and Britain" in dealing with the Hong Kong issue: that is, to simply return this island, which is inseparable from China, to China. Otherwise, any opinions are either meaningless or have ulterior motives. Hong Kong originally belonged to China. The people who should express genuine opinions on Hong Kong are not the million people of Hong Kong, but the 450 million Chinese people. On the day after London announced the reorganization of Hong Kong's political system and "soliciting the opinions of all sectors of society," Reuters in Shanghai sent out the following telegram: "As Hong Kong transitions to civil administration, outside the British Consulate General here today, someone wrote a request to return Hong Kong in chalk. According to one slogan: 'We want to take back Hong Kong, this is our island.'" This is the general opinion of the Chinese people on the Hong Kong issue. I wonder what "Simple Simon" and his ilk will think after hearing this?</p>

<h3 id="e117">Reading "Understanding America" <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Author: Chen Jianheng, Distributor: Jianfan Bookstore, Publication Date: December, Year 34</p>
<p>Among our allied nations, the United States can be considered the closest. In the future, our country's revival and construction will greatly require the assistance of the United States. If we want to build a truly democratic, peaceful, unified, and united new China, we must achieve close cooperation with the United States in all aspects. At the same time, the United States, as former British Prime Minister Churchill said, "The position of the United States today is not only related to the future of China, but also to the entire world peace, and the United States truly has the power to determine world peace." From another perspective, the United States is the most advanced country in material construction, and its cultural progress and scientific development have also made great contributions to world culture. How should we understand the situation of this country? There is no more urgent need than today.</p>
<p>Most people only superficially understand the material civilization of the United States, only knowing that it is a country with the most abundant living enjoyment, or only narrowly learn about some social situations of the United States from Hollywood movies, but in fact, they neglect a comprehensive and systematic understanding. As for looking at the United States with colored glasses, that is even more incorrect.</p>
<p>Recently, the "Understanding America" book published by the Commercial Press completely takes an objective stance, analyzing all aspects of the United States' situation. It is a book worth reading. The author, Mr. Chen Jianheng, is currently a professor at National Central University. This "Understanding America" was written based on his observations in the United States and after consulting some famous books about the United States. In particular, G. S. Counts' "Social Foundations of Education" and C. H. Keyserling's "America Set Free" provided this book with many valuable materials. However, Mr. Chen emphasized the viewpoint of "Chinese people's understanding of America," and did not directly translate the original books, but carefully selected and adapted the parts of those famous books that are particularly needed by Chinese people. Therefore, I feel that this work is indeed not a waste of effort. The author allows us to recognize the true face of our allied nation from his book.</p>
<p>The scope of this book is very broad, and it discusses the American family system, material civilization, and their national character. In terms of economics and politics, it raises important issues such as free economy and collective economy, democratic thought and democratic government. The general situation of education and the spirit of education, and education and new democracy are discussed in detail in separate chapters without fear of being verbose. Finally, after explaining the United States' foreign relations and peace ideals, it is attached with a "Reference for the New China," which is a chapter very worthy of study. The author tells us how to digest democracy, reflect on our country from the current situation of the United States, and encourage the people of the country to welcome and catch up with this new democratic era.</p>
<p>If we want to truly understand America, we certainly cannot ignore the historical composition of its nation, the political, economic, and educational and cultural background. However, the United States is a scientifically advanced country, and the foundation of its founding lies in the development of its educational spirit. Therefore, we might as well use American education and culture as the core to understand its entire situation. Therefore, the author very much hopes that we can grasp an outline of American culture. He knows deeply that education and culture have a leading role in social transformation, so he specifically directs us to recognize the trends of new education in America. The title of the book is "Understanding America," and it is also named "The Educational Background of America," which is what it means. Although it is said that the various aspects of the United States are discussed with education and culture as the core, it does not neglect other social forms that determine the role of education and culture, such as political, economic, and social conditions. All those that affect the educational system are explained one by one.</p>
<p>We know that in the past twenty years or so, our country's education system has been most influenced by the United States. If we want to promote the relationship between the two countries, we cannot ignore cultural exchanges. People in general have doubts about American education, and even many people in Europe suspect the American educational system. After this war, everything that the national strength of the United States has demonstrated outwardly proves the success of American education. Regarding this point, Mr. Chang Daozhi has a very thorough view. The American educational system and facilities will undoubtedly become the mainstream of educational thought in the world. Therefore, even if they are not majoring in education, it is also very necessary to correctly understand the background of American education and culture and its general national conditions.</p>
<p>Now let me talk about the contents of this book. Chapter 1, The Evolution of the Family System, discusses how the self-sufficient agricultural family, the development of the West, and the development of industry broke up the old organization of the family. It then discusses the characteristics of the modern family. The two important topics of the women's self-awareness movement and the future of the family system are thoroughly reviewed in this chapter. Chapter 2, The Rapid Advance of Material Civilization, makes us admire the excellent weather and abundant resources of the United States, and even more amazed at their ever-changing science, the progress of production technology, and the development of transportation. Chapter 3 is also very important, and we can understand the characteristics of Americans and the natural and historical conditions that constitute these characteristics. What is shown here is a vibrant and enterprising national spirit of young people. The author says that this newborn national character belongs to young people, and he points out the American character: first, they are particularly interested in material things; second, they have naive and impulsive emotions; third, they are full of activity; fourth, they like concrete things; fifth, they value industrial and commercial ethics. Some regions of the United States seem to have some special habits, but in terms of the entire culture, they are unified: "Just as China and the Soviet Union cannot be divided into many small countries, the United States can integrate forty-eight states into a cultural system." Chapter 4 discusses the scope of free economy and collective economy. It first talks about the economic situation in the pre-industrial period, and then develops to economic liberalism from the rise of division of labor and markets. Because of the result of free competition, it reflects the defects of the free economic development: "The free development of the economic system has the following drawbacks: (1) instability of production; (2) imbalance between production and consumption; (3) waste of materials and power; (4) wasting natural resources." The gradually budding new trend of the economy is "(1) the union of industry and commerce; (2) the cooperation of agriculture; (3) the organization of labor; (4) the intervention of the government." From here, we can see that the American economy has a trend toward a collective economy. Chapter 5, Democratic Thought and Democratic Government, allows us to see the documents of democratic thought in American history. Coupled with a free and equal living environment, it is naturally easier to express their democratic spirit. However, the method of realizing democratic politics in the United States has already surpassed the laissez-faire individual competition. The method they use today to strive for freedom and happiness has gradually shifted from laissez-faire individualism to collective liberalism. "The government's control over the national production and consumption machine is actually derived from the people's will to seek life security." The establishment of a progressive and sound educational system is a necessary means to achieve an ideal democratic society, because since government intervention in private enterprises is necessary, the people must obtain the wisdom to supervise the government, which is all an educational issue. Chapter 6 describes the current situation of elementary, secondary, and university education facilities in the United States, and also permeates the spirit of freedom, equality, and child-centered education, explaining the new concept of education that Americans have—education as a right that everyone should have. Chapter 7, from the economic environment and the international environment, indicates that in the new era of democracy, education should take the realization of the happiness of all people as the premise, and the promotion of popular education and the increase of mass intelligence have become a new trend in the new era of democracy. Educational systems, facilities, curricula, and teaching materials must all be in line with the needs of this new era. Figures such as Dewey, Kilpatrick, and Judd have all advocated that teachers must be the leaders and implementers of social transformation. Chapter 8 talks about how the United States, from the early days of its founding after 1789, rose to become a world power, as well as the expansion of national power after the Spanish-American War, and the contributions it made in the two World Wars. From foreign relations, it talks about the ideal of peace, which is indeed the premise of the entire human race, and at least half of it is in the hands of the United States. The author powerfully pointed out: "We firmly believe that peace should eventually be the ultimate destination of mankind, and we hope that the two major peace-loving nations of China and the United States can join hands with all countries in the world to continuously strive for this highest ideal of mankind!"</p>
<p>Looking at this book "Understanding America" as a whole, although the author has never had subjective criticisms and opinions, some of the facts and materials cited in the book are indeed enough for us to understand the United States. At least, we can understand why the United States has become the initiator of determining world peace from the evolution of American culture. We hope that everyone can get the opportunity to reflect on themselves from the historical process of the development of American culture—to understand their own country by understanding America.</p>
<p>Today's China is facing famine and disaster, and the crisis of civil war is imminent. Due to the lack of materials, most people are struggling on the line of disease and death. The people's selfish mentality is deeply rooted in the country, morality is declining day by day, and education and culture are backward, science and technology are naive, resources cannot be developed, and the people's strength cannot be exerted. If this ancient nation wants to talk about regeneration and revival, it must absorb the democratic spirit and creative spirit of the still-young American nation. We must learn from the strengths of the United States with a humble attitude and welcome the new era of democratization and industrialization!</p>
<h3 id="e118">Ai Qing's "On Poetry" <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Fang</p>
<p>Publisher: New New Publishing House, Publication Date: April, Year 35, Shanghai Edition</p>
<p>After reading the modern poet Ai Qing's "Poems Dedicated to the Countryside," I obtained his recently published "On Poetry." On the cover, it is printed: "I don't know if mankind will ever live without poetry..." From this sentence, we have already seen the connection between poetry and human life.</p>
<p>This book cannot be said to be a systematic theory of poetry. It is a collection of several important articles on poetry. But after I finished reading it, I felt a surge of fervent vitality, the power of life, filling my whole body. I was deeply moved by the author's poetic, refined, and powerful words. I feel that this era needs poetry, poetry that calls out for the suffering people.</p>
<p>This collection includes five important topics: the first article, "On Poetry," is nearly seventy pages long. It is not a dissertation divided into chapters, but is written in the style of quotations, with vivid and powerful feelings about poetry, which is quite thought-provoking. This may be because the author is a poet, so he can write so refined and concise. From the general concept of poetry, the spirit of poetry, to thought, life, subject and theme, form, technology, image, imagery, symbolism, association, imagination, language, and creation, the author expresses his views and opinions on poetry in brief sentences. Among these, there is the essence of art, and it permeates the scientific creative method and the philosophical thinking process. Some aphorisms are simply the most progressive artistic theories, and they are very worthy of letting people think slowly. For example, "Anything that can make mankind develop upwards is beautiful, good, and poetic." "Philosophy thinks about the world abstractly; poetry explains the world concretely—the purpose is to transform the world." "The more it is about life, the more beautiful it is, the more it is about humanity, the more beautiful it is." "As long as human language does not become extinct, poetry will not become extinct." "Man exists, therefore man thinks." "Life is the most fertile soil from which art arises. Thought and emotion must spread their roots in its bottom layer." "Association and imagination are the journey of thinking." All contain the atmosphere of poetry and the profound meaning of philosophy. (Although this article on poetry is said to be in the style of quotations, it is not all short. Some are composed of more sentences to form a paragraph of thought. Although they are fragmented thoughts, you can also find the affiliation and connection of thoughts.)</p>
<p>The second article, "The Beauty of Poetic Prose," is a short essay that explains the connection between poetry and prose. The author believes that the most beautiful prose and poetry should be the most capable of reflecting life. Even if there is good rhyme without rich imagery, it is not enough to be beautiful. The third article, "Poetry and Propaganda," is a relatively long thesis. Regarding the evaluation of poetry, according to the author: "This article emphasizes: how it expresses people's wishes, the joys and sorrows of life, and the light of hope and lofty will emitted from the dim fate with sincere language and fresh images." He believes that all art, in its fundamental meaning, is propaganda, and only by not leaving propaganda can the artistic value of poetry be expressed. The author said: "Conscientious people should not be silent, but use the power attached to truth in our poems to destroy the dregs of those decadent worlds!" He also explains the task of poetry in general. The fourth article, "Poetry and the Times," emphasizes the poetry needed in the modern era and narrates the path that Chinese new poetry must take from the initial founding period of the May Fourth Movement to the imitation of Western metrical poetry, and then to the imitation of various schools of European and American modern poetry. The fifth article, "On Poets," again adopts the style of quotations, including seventy-five fragments of thought. There are passionate shouts and insightful hints in these. They are all moving sentences like poetry. How to be worthy of being a poet, and how a poet should complete his historical and social tasks, are all said very thoroughly in these random notes.</p>
<p>At first, I felt that this book was too much like "Quotations," or it needed some explanation. Later, I thought that these fragmented thoughts should be a little implicit, why say everything completely? Moreover, artistic theory (many of the theories in this collection are "aesthetic" theories) cannot be completely expressed anyway. It is also very necessary to allow readers to have more opportunities for thinking and exploration.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that readers will use the mood and method of appreciating poems to think about this "On Poetry" that contains a lot of truth.</p>

<p>Zheng Zongkai, a nationally recognized authority on police officer education, has authored numerous works, such as "Revised General Theory of Police Law" and "General Theory of Police Mobilization" (both published by Commercial Press), "The Theory and Practice of Modern Police," "Police Officer Patrol Duty Theory," and "Fourth Edition Police Officer Case Handling Manual" (all published by Zhengzhong Book Company). The Chongqing editions are mostly sold out, and many bureau chiefs and senior police officers in various provinces and cities have a copy on their desks or in their drawers. In recent years, Zheng has retired to a certain national bank, and apart from a few key personnel who know Zheng is a police expert, hardly anyone notices him. It is said that Zheng was invited to a Sino-American program to hold an important position, but he politely declined; he also repeatedly declined the position of director of the Beiping Police Academy. He is currently staying in Beijing to recuperate. During the War of Resistance, Zheng edited the "Citizen and Police" weekly in Chongqing's Dagong Daily, which was loved and welcomed by the general public. It is said that Zheng also directs the "Citizen and Police" section published weekly in the Nanjing Peace Daily, and will host a nationwide police academic monthly magazine recently.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Introducing "Fog Enshrouded Chongqing" <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Zeng Publisher: Wenjiang Bookstore Author: Zhu Lei</p>
<p>I happened to buy a few books in a bookstore, brought them home to read, and also happened to discover a beautifully printed novel "Fog Enshrouded Chongqing." I seemed to have an excessive fondness for it, and wanted to comment on it here. The story is quite ordinary: Wei Yuehan, a young man who studied automobile engineering in the United States, returned to China via Hong Kong before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. There, he met a newspaper reporter, Li, and the two hit it off immediately, becoming close friends. Through Li's introduction, he met Li's dream girl, Miss Yang. They met briefly, always separated, but they both left a good impression on each other. Later, Yuehan arrived in Chongqing, where his high expectations for his motherland led to great disappointment. He was trapped in the mountain city and became destitute. Soon after, Li also arrived in Chongqing and moved him into his own home, helping him find a job. Then the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and Miss Yang's entire family was trapped in Hong Kong, with no news of them. Both men secretly fell deeply in love with her, but neither expressed it. Three years quickly passed, and she suddenly returned to Chongqing after a difficult journey. A problem arose between the two men. Li greatly admired Yuehan, and his sympathy was aroused by his learning and his altruistic efforts. Li himself was an optimist, so he was willing to sacrifice love to fulfill friendship. Yuehan was deeply touched by Li's kindness, so he left without saying goodbye and joined the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India and Burma. Miss Yang, unable to forget their encounter in Hong Kong three years earlier, made a special trip to Kunming to find him. Although the two met, Yuehan clearly valued his career more than love. Soon after, he was transferred to Burma. Later, Yuehan found another opportunity to counterattack Chongqing, but unfortunately the plane was blocked by dense fog in the mountains and returned to Kunming. Miss Yang suffered several disappointments and suspected that Li was stirring up trouble behind the scenes. Love turned into hatred, and she resolutely married a third party. Sadly, at that time, this pair of friends in adversity, one was interviewing news in the Xiang-Gui area, and the other was killed in a sniper battle during the counterattack on Lashio.</p>
<p>After the war, Li finally understood all the misunderstandings between them. When he found an opportunity to explain to Miss Yang, it was all too late. He blamed the responsibility on the dense fog of the mountain city and the mysterious fate, and they wished each other well in their efforts for China after victory.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the author's writing is a failure. The short three days in Hong Kong occupy almost half the book, and there is a hint of glibness everywhere. The latter half spans several years in time and several cities in space, and involves several historical facts of the War of Resistance. He finished it with a light touch using cinematic techniques, and some places are too concise, making the reader feel as if they have missed a sentence or two and experienced the vicissitudes of life. The author is probably used to writing plays (I have seen several of his one-act plays in the past, and the results were indeed not bad). He handles each paragraph with bold strokes, and the climax and rhythm are arranged very skillfully and naturally. However, novels have their own rules, and doing so inevitably makes people suspect that it is too coincidental and lacks flesh and blood.</p>
<p>In terms of writing style, the author seems to be a disciple of Mr. Shen Congwen, and traces of his imitation and plagiarism can be seen everywhere. For example, the talkative tea boy at the beginning is clearly stolen from "Eight Steeds." The section in the eighth paragraph where Miss Yang goes to Kunming to see Yuehan vaguely resembles some vivid tones and writing styles in "Ruyi." Of course, the author has his own intelligence and his own threats, and careless readers can easily overlook his imitation, but in my opinion, it feels a bit too blatant. I wonder what the reaction would be if Mr. Shen Congwen actually saw it?</p>
<p>The third shortcoming is that the personalities of the three protagonists are too vague. The author only cares about the development of the plot and does not delve into the portrayal of characters. Fourth, the author is too superstitious about fatalism, such as the old man's prediction in the letter, the omen of throwing water slices on the beach, and the mysterious fog in the mountain city in 1945. Although we dare not definitively deny fatalism, it seems inappropriate for a young author and seems contrived.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I originally said I was praising him, but here I have assigned him many faults. Perhaps it is the meaning of "love too deeply, inevitably blame too strictly." In summary, the author has his own abundant imagination and his own talent for writing plays. His entire story is like a detailed film script, becoming more exciting as it progresses. The ending is especially deep and moving, and extremely clever. Let's not bother to consider its authenticity; at least the ending of this story is very successful.</p>
