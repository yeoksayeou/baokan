<h3>綜合會談尚無結果　馬司關懷和平前途　周恩來對國大表示態度</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕民盟人士十二日晨在藍家莊召集內部會議至十一時，旋赴交行與靑年黨社會賢達舉行會議。共產黨代表周恩來·黃必武·李維漢·鄧穎超於十一時半亦往參加，討論國大名單問題，迄下午二時始散。周恩來即往訪司使，晤談至四時始出，時非正式綜合會談在孫科寓邸舉行，周恩來與董必武亦往出席，計到代表吳鐵城·邵力子·王世杰·莫德惠·胡霖·繆嘉銘·曾琦·陳啓天·章伯鈞·羅隆基·及召集人孫科·政協秘書長雷震·談商國大名單及憲草問題。周恩來當時表示以上兩題，現均無法談。黃炎培曾主張重行擬訂　草，惟時間侷促，似不可能，此非正式綜合談話會，歷兩小時半，因無具體結果，聞十三日繼續舉行，將仍以憲草爲討論中心。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕社會賢達代表胡霖，上午十時會訪司使，談半小時辭出。大使於午後接見周恩來長談，下午五時訪馬特使，轉達胡氏意見。司馬兩氏對和談前途甚爲關懷。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕蔣主席十二日五時離官邸赴孫科寓，是時孫正主持綜合會議，主席未進曾塲，留十分鐘即離去。旋即馳經中山北路至下關車站，復經江邊散步而返。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕孫科，雷震，十二日晚八時許聯袂晋謁主席，報吿今日會談情形。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕周恩來於十二日孫　商談時，下午六時先退席，往訪馬特使，談兩小時許始返梅園新村。今晚據共產黨代表團發言人稱：周氏今日談話係表明共產黨能度，其要點爲：（一）國大即應停開，如不能停開，即將引起全面破裂，此種破裂責任，且應由政府負之，（二）將米如果召開國大，必須依照政協決議。</p>
<p>各黨將提名單　民盟發表文告</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕社會賢達代表，十二日繼續爲和平奔走，希望靑年黨，民盟即能提出國大代表名單，俾國大能在和平統一之空氣下召開。據聞：李璜將在滬商酌提名單事，靑年黨及張君勱領導下之民主社會黨，可能短期內提出名單，民盟則堅持一切須照政協決議辦事，如能完成各項應完成之手續，自當參加國大。今日雖多方接觸，仍無結果。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會民主黨領袖張君勱，十二日晨偕蔣勻田及孫寳毅等由京夜車抵滬。常晚即由張氏召集該黨人士在愚國路該黨辦事處舉行談話會。首由張氏將在京商談情形及其所悉各方意見，向在座者報吿，繼由各人詳細檢討該黨今後態度，並作整個之交換意見。聞張氏等商討至十二日深晚止，尙未有決定性之結果。十三日上年將繼續會談，屆時對參加國大，提交名單等將有所決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕民盟一部份人士，十二日晚對國大問題發出正式文告如下：「民盟歷次宣言擁護政協決議，一切行動以此爲惟一的依據，同人願盡最後一切努力，以求政協決議，關於國大開會以前各項手續之完成，完成以後，即一致參加國大，未完成則暫不參加」。</p>
<h3>國大展期三日　象徵大局轉機　徐傅霖對記者發表談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中國社會民主黨宣傳部長徐傳霖氏，十二日接見記者稱：政府宣佈國大展期三日揭幕，希望各黨各派均能參加，本黨張君勱，蔣勻田，孫寳剛三氏，已於今長由京返滬準備在日內召開黨內重要會議，商討對時局之態度，以便向政府提出答覆。至於最近各方面在京舉行之非正式綜合會議。商談內容如何，余因不悉其詳，未能奉吿。記者詢以民社黨對參加國大事，是否與民盟採取同一步調，渠稱：民盟係由若干黨派組織而成，俟各黨派內部決定後，再綜合商討，作最後決定，本人爲民社憲一份子，對民盟事不擬過問。記者詢以劉國大展期三日之觀感如何，渠稱：此乃象徽和平大局有一轉機，希望在此三日內，一切問題均能解決，因爲大家都是中國人，但求能和平，不妨委曲以全，化除成見，最近數日，各方面商談內容如何，余雖不甚明陳，但就大體視察，第三方面比從前似更見切實，實際上如大家　心誠意解決問題，並不需多少時間。徐氏並稱：目前商談內容，側車兩點：（一）是憲法，（二）是改　政府。前者必須完成政協審議手續，再由立法院綜合修正，提父國大，後者政府方面，主張先改組政府召開國大，再改組行政院，中共主張先改組行政院，再開國大，但且前是否有折衷方案提出，例如先決定行政院改組之名單，再開國大，然後改組行政院等一類情形，余實不得而知，但亦或有可能。談至此，徐氏並感慨述稱：本屆國大產生之憲法，恐怕不能永久施行，因本屆國大制憲代表，十年前即已產生，日後固難免有人提出非議，同時又有各黨派分贓之嫌，謂其不能代表民意，亦無不可，俗語云。「名不正，則言不順」，似此基礎不固，難免不受動搖。但話雖如此，「惡法猶甚於無法」，如長期實行約法之治，亦非允當，蓋由一黨訓政過渡到實施憲政，都要有此一道橋樑，吾人自亦不必過分悲觀。徐氏並說明渠本人係廣東省區域代表之一，截至現在止，尙未晋京報到，目前大局，如果能够解決，大家都參加國大，自無問題，設如不能解決，那祗有考慮個人立塲，決定報到與吾，反正一個人與大會並無影響。最後徐氏稱：中國前途，祗有推誠相與，才有辦法，同時更希望政府能在政治上迅速改良，同時更希望政府能在政治上迅速改良，則大局統一，才能增進基礎。又據記者探悉，張君勱，蔣勻田二氏，可能於明日普京。</p>
<h3>國大代表報到　昨共有十六人</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕十二日國大代表報到共十六人，有陳樹人，鄭介民，張其昀等。又因國大延期，本日預定舉行之預備會未舉行，國大籌備委會各處組工作仍緊張，十二日朱放假仍照常辦公。</p>

<h3>張弛之間</h3>
<p>— 本報記者平肅</p>
<p>南京這幾天　是冠蓋雲集。旅館荒，汽車荒；此外，是泥多，制服多，徽章多—新聞記者也多。</p>
<p>但是，最多的還是各式各樣的傳說，五花八門的謠言。政局刻刻變化，誰也不敢說得定到底會發展到什麼樣子。</p>
<p>十一月十一日，原定國大開幕的前一天，是「變」得最劃烈的一天。有人說調人們已請求延期到十二月一日召開國大，有人說決不延期，連十二日開會時致答詞的代表也已經有所決定了——一說是胡適之，一說是于證主敎。到下午四點鐘，洪蘭友在大會堂招待各代表的時候，到會八九百位代表非正式交換意見的結果，是推選孔庚致答詞——會還是要開的。國大籌備處發出了十一明十二日上午十一時正式開幕的通知。孫院長在立法院發表，開幕式在十二日上午舉行；但孫院長也添了一句話，說是政府在十一日午夜另有重要發佈。</p>
<p>可能的結論，似乎是十二日的開幕式是一定舉行，但是開幕式之後不一定就會立刻正式進行，因爲立法院在十一日開會的程序稍有變更：王亮疇先生在四點鐘瀟洒地走上立法院的大樓梯之後，並沒有提出原定的報吿——立法院審查憲草修正案的限期已經展延了。</p>
<p>國民大會堂的布置已經全部完成，簇新的小國旗在晚風中招展，警衛處的憲兵在會堂院子裏小心地檢查樹根的泥土裏有沒有藏着炸彈。代表們從全國各地趕到，忙着辦簽到手被。天色漸漸黑下來，政局的Zero　hour愈來愈逼近了。</p>
<p>調人們在奔跑。新聞記者們的吉普車緊緊釘着。電話鈴聲愈來愈多。一千三百多位國大代表呢——有一位說他覺得有些苦悶；另有一位說是「有茫然之感」；有許多在計劃開幕式之後的小組活動。</p>
<p>中共還是很堅決的樣子。民盟說是要遞一封信，提供新的辦法。關會，爭論；再趕到另外別的地方，又是開會，爭論。</p>
<p>天黑了。怎樣呢？還是大家茫然。</p>
<p>突然，在離開十一月十二日還只有兩個　頭的時候，緊張的弓弦鬆弛了。</p>
<p>招待所裏，代表們的房門突然開了，招待所的職員說了三句簡短的話：「大會延期至十五日開幕。明晨九時謁陵仍照原定舉行。如天雨，謁陵取消。」</p>
<p>調人們還在奔跑，代表們在等待。新聞記者在等待。全中華民國四萬萬五千萬的人民都在忍耐着，等待着。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>對這三天的期望</h3>
<p>政府擴受調人的意見及社會賢達的　請，又將再番延期而決定於十一月十二日開幕的國民大會，再度延期三天，至十五日正式開幕。在京的國民大會代表，對於國民大會未能如期開幕、雖不免失望，但是昨天全體代表均在國父陵國，參加中樞所舉行的紀念典禮，而對着國父的遺容，　衡目前國內的大局，誰也不能不感慨萬千？全國人民在主席領導之下，由國民革命而對日抗戰，雖已完成了國父遺敎的一部份；但是我國萬般皆落後，處於令日的國際環境之下，如何完成建國的偉業？怎樣改善國計民生？又如何走上憲政的正軌？這些都是全國人民亟待解決的問題。</p>
<p>惟天下事莫不有緩急與先後之分，中外人士，莫不認爲中國當前政治的出路，唯有走上憲政的正軌一法；而憲政時期的開始，非有一部切合國民需要的憲法不可。國民大會的開幕，就是象徵着我國憲政時期的開始；故全國上下，莫不渴望全國各黨各派暨無黨無派的代表，均能於國父誕辰的一天，聚首於一堂，從長計議國家的根本大法。但因中共始終撇開不了黨派的私見及其利益，至今猶不惜千方百計，阻撓國民大會的召開，不僅使在京國大代表爲之失望，而且也使我們替中共的前途惋惜。幸而政府一本和平解決國內紛爭的初衷，處處忍讓，原已到了忍無可忍，讓無可讓的地步，國大的如期開幕，絕無考慮的餘地；但是到了最後的一剎那，全席仍本着忍讓的精神，又作最後的讓步，將國大延期三天。前天午夜，我們接到了國大延期的消息，對於中共的幡然覺悟，又燃起一綫希望。中共也是黃帝的子孫，看到主席一護再讓的苦心以及人民渴望憲政的迫切，怎能無動於中呢？難道黨派的觀念足以遮蓋了一切良知嗎？我們法不相信中央是如此的。所以我們在國大延期的三天之內，對於政府中共暨第三方面，仍抱着極大的期望。</p>
<p>第一，國大延期三天，爲時雖短，但這是一個轉機，而且也是中共的最後機曾；中共應該反躬自省，訴諸良知，再三思之，切莫錯過這最後的良機。須知抗戰勝利後的國事糾紛，久久未能解決，完全由於國共的相持不下。回溯一年餘來的和談經過，在我們老百姓看來，歷歷在目，是非常淸楚的。我們只看到政府一讓再讓。甚至讓無可讓時，還再作超過限度的讓步；政府的一番苦心，我們老百姓完全自能體諒，而且深表同悄；但是中共一年餘來，在和談的過程中，不僅有進無退，而且還有得寸進尺的氣槪。中共對於黨派觀念，幾乎超過民族國家，早已爲我們老百姓所唾棄；但是爲了國家的前途計，此際迫切需要的，是和平，民主，統一；面不是戰亂。專制。分裂。所以在無可奈何中，只有蘄求中共的幡然覺悟。希望終是不絕如縷，至今猶未絕望，時至今日，中共方面也必須有所讓步了吧！否則一再阻撓國民大會的召開，不僅違背人民的公意，而且將爲建國途中的障碍了。中共何以自處？應該三思之。</p>
<p>第二，第三方面人士，包括民盟靑年黨以及社會賢達三種人士，在最近的一個月來，在國共之開，奔走號呼，企岡打開目前和談的僵局，却已盡了一番的努力。但是在這國大延期的、三天內，尤其是到了最後的一剎那之間，更應作最後的努力。從高處看，我們當然希望第三方面的最後努力，能打開目前國共的僵局，使國大於十五日開幕，不再延期，中共代表也能在全體代表熱烈的鼓掌聲中，走入會塲。就是降低了眼光，也希望國大開幕時，至少有第三方面代表出席。我們不必陳義過高，我們只要請第三方面人士，平心靜氣，把這個問題，訴諸良知，問一問中共限　國大的召開是不是全國人民的公意？民盟諸君素以人民代表自稱，現在全國的老百姓，要和平，要統一，要實行憲政、怎能不願民意，而跟了別人亂跑呢？所以我們希望第三方面人士，除了在這三天之內作最後的努力之外，並須不顧中共的態度如何自行決定參加延期於十五日開幕前國民大會。時機迫切，不容再徘徊瞻顧了。</p>
<p>第三，政府作超過限度的讓步，雖不免使人民失望；但是政府的苦心，必能獲得人民的諒解與同情，但吾人仍希望政府，在這三天內，能够獲得妥善辦法，務使各黨派代表暨社會賢達，均能參加國大。在此緊要關頭，尤應高瞻遠矚，從大處着眼，勿爭枝節，充分表現出「盡其在我」的精神，打開目前的僵局。</p>
<p>要之，國大延期三天，一天又過去了，只剩下了四十八小時了。時局發展到今天，可謂已到了最高峯。希望全國上下，起脫黨派，把握時機，務使象徵中國和平統一的民主的國民大會，能於十五日開幕。</p>
<h3>論法國選舉結果</h3>
<p>最近美法兩國相繼普選的結果，在今日國際政治上，是値得我們注意的。第一是美國參衆兩院於本月五日舉行改選，結果是在野十四年的共和黨獲勝，在兩院內竟壓倒了民主黨而佔優勢；第二是法國於本月十日舉行普選，選舉第四共和國第一屆國民議會議員，結果，共產黨一躍而爲第一。假如我們說美國共和黨的勝利是美國的民衆向右轉的表示，那麼快國共產黨的佔光，也可以說是法國民衆，向左轉的先聲了。</p>
<p>據法國新開社巴黎十一日的消息。共產黨得五百三十五萬一千票，人民共和黨得四百九十八萬八千票，相差僅三十六萬三千票。故在國民議會中共產必黨得一百六十四席，人民共和黨一百六十席，相差僅四席。此外，最出人意料之外的，是戴高樂同盟，只得着五十八萬五千票，在新國民議會中只得着九席。　高樂對於新憲法，曾經發表過激烈的批評，選舉前他也非常活動。他的政治立塲比較是守舊的，對內他主張提高總統行政的權力，對外他主張英法合作，造成成西方集團，以抵抗外國支配世界的力量。他和英國前任首相邱吉爾差不多，他們兩位都是數國的英雄，全國國民，對於他們，都異常尊重，但是他們的政治思想，已經跟不上時代，英法兩國的民衆不能再追隨他們。</p>
<p>第二次大戰後的世界，最重要的就是各國　濟復員的問題。經長過期戰爭的毀壞之後，各國的人民渴想一個安定的生活、民族的驕傲和政治的自由，終究敵不過　餓的肚子，因此帝國主義和民主政治，也決不　全部代替經濟改善的趨勢。現在世界上任何國家的政府，對於本國的國民經濟，如不能加以改善，則其本身，必定要崩潰。英國工黨受英國人民的擁護，就是因爲它能够將重要企業收歸國營，不讓少數資本家壟斷。美國共和黨的勝利，因爲民主黨的統制經濟引起社會上的不安。法國比杜爾政府最初的成功也由於他不顧一切，答應提高工人的工資百分之二十五。</p>
<p>這一次法國的選舉結果，表示法國的民眾雖然對比杜爾政府，並沒有完全失望，但他們却想作更進一步的要求，所以轉而擁護共產黨。但是共產黨雖然得票最多，同人民共和黨相差到底有限。兩黨必須合作，並且和其他政黨合作，纔可以實行自己的政策。今後法國政府的政策，決不是一黨的政策，而是各黨政策的調和，不過共產黨旣然佔大多數，他們也就有支配政府政策的力量。</p>
<p>從國際政治的觀點來看，假如我們說法國這一次選舉的結果，共產黨勝利，就象徵蘇聯的政治勢力侵入西歐，那又未免神經過敏。法國政府一向同蘇聯保持友好的關係，共產黨就不勝利，法國政府也沒有反蘇的意向。法國的民族，是世界上最愛好自由的民族，法國的政府是眞正的民主政府。假如一個政府有了任何專制的傾向，法國的民衆立刻就要起來推翻它。法國民衆今天最注意的問題，並不是國際的陣綫，而是太國國民經濟的改善。法國民衆並不需要作任何世界强國的附席，他們只希望作一個和平，富庶，獨立，自由的國家。假如法國的共產黨想把法國政府，造成功南斯拉夫那樣的狀態，他們將會遭遇慘烈的失敗。何况他們在這次選舉中，國人民共和黨票數相差有限，而且在這次選舉中沒有投票的選民選有將近五百萬之多。</p>
<p>我們對於這次法國民意的表現，應當表示深厚的同情。他們已經深刻地認識了現在世界題的中心，就是各國經濟的復員。世界各國人民生活急需要安定。爲求得生活安定，必須要全力注意改善人民生活的政府。國際集團的鬥爭，帝國主義的復活，民主主義的空談，都不能引起迫切需要生活改善的民衆的興趣。今後的法國新政府，今後任何國家的政府都必須要解決這一個中心的問題，只有這一個中心間題獲得解決，世界人類綫有和平與幸福，世界各國政府　算是眞正受人民　護的政府。</p>

<h3>蘇省第二區各縣　今開財政檢討會</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州十二日電〕江蘇省第二行政區財政業務檢討會議，十三日晨八時在蘇省銀行搗暮，所屬蘇·錫·武·崑·太·虞·吳·澄·八縣縣長財政科長稽　處長今已集中蘇垣報到，財廳長董轍氏亦偕主任視察沈乘飭，科長顧俊升衛成章等，於今午一時許由鎭專車抵蘇，寓蘇農分行。</p>
<p>重心有五點</p>
<p>本報記者特於會議前夕趨往訪謁，就檢討會議之重心所在，及蘇省財政之回顧與前瞻諸問題，有所探詢，承董氏發表談話如次：自七月份起，財政恢復三級制後，縣市財源己較戰前尤爲充裕，今後如再有收支不敷情形，當非制度不良，乃係人謀不臧，本省爲求避免此人事上之缺憾，以使各縣市財政臻於健全起見，故有分區召開檢討會議之決定。現一五爾區已於九日在鎭舉行完畢，其重心有五：（一）聽受各縣財政業務報吿。（二）檢討省頒各種財政法令章則，是否適合各縣實際情况。（三）商討今後加强財政稅務工作之方案。（四）今後各縣市財政收支之大端。（五）各縣市財政主管交換意見，求行政方面之協調。</p>
<p>回顧與前瞻</p>
<p>至於蘇省財政之回顧與前瞻，就一般性而言，過去田賦轄免縣市，財政全賴中央有限之撥補，雖益以自治捐稅及各項因地制宜特稅，其收入總額尙不能與所轄免之出賦相抵，因以一年以來各縣市財政，應付公敎人員之薪津猶見支絀，對一切建設舉辦困難，此則堪稱遺憾。現自七月一日起財政改制，契稅營業稅均劃歸地方，田賦亦繼續征實，今後縣市財政固旺盛可期，惟七八九十十一諸月份尙屬靑黃不接之期，因契稅營業稅轉移伊始，難期旺收，田賦則征實後須待彙賣於糧食部後，始可獲得現款也。自十二月份後，當可　正充裕，嗣後縣市經費預算，當以敎育及建設等事業費爲支出之大宗。幷有所吿慰於社會者，即各縣市所有因地制宜特稅，現均已一律明令廢除，不得　征。茲悉檢討會議日程預定兩日，必要時得延</p>

<p>農民苦痛關系非細</p>
<p>工商之不景氣，報載日有所見，可見各方面對此問題，都很重視。國貨廠商，被外貨壓倒，可是眞正愛用國貨之人還佔多數，就是農民。因爲他們一切應用品，不求美觀，只求堅固而實用，回到農村之家，少見洋貨，即此可知。但所憂者，農產品與城市加工品交換，貴與賤實相差太遠了，以致穀賤傷農，農村破產！他們一年所得不够還債，因爲人工肥料很貴及捐稅等，談不到其他要求，購買力弱，鄕鎭商業日益蕭條，最後必使城市商店同歸於盡。一個鄕人吿訴我們，農民太苦，沒有人替我們說一句公平話！譬如說：現在剛收米，可是價賤得不値錢，不能抵補田上所負之債！在收成時期要維持信用，只好不顧一切賤資還債；但是我們未來生活，及來年種田應用，一無着落！其他根本不該談，亦不該想！又如現在麥很貴，可是農民早就無麥了！總之，解救經濟危機，若不從挽救農村着想，必然要同歸於盡的！（靑浦朱培德）</p>
<p>民國路爲舊日華界與法租界毗連處，滬戰發生國軍在新開河及小東門築有堡壘各一座，以禦頑敵，但勝利迄今，業已一年有餘，該兩堡壘依舊屹然存在。每有無知之徒，進內便溺。入夏穢氣四溢，殊　有碍衛生，更且損害市容，切盼有關當局，迅將該兩堡壘拆卸，以重衛生而壯觀瞻。（關幼山）</p>
<p>莘莊自劃屬上海市範園以來，一切行政人事等，與市區方面之接觸，日益頻繁，惟以交通尙未恢復至戰前狀態，故出入深感行旅不便與時間　促。今年國慶日起，兩路局雖已將行車時刻調整，滬杭路且增駛抗嘉嘉滬區間車兩列，徒以該區間班爲特別快車，小站例不停留，故多數平民，仍未沾到便利。尤以吾莘莊一站商旅，時常目覩該嘉滬班因誤點而停留本站等候西湖號遊覽車交換，每次有十餘分鐘之久，而車中乘客寬舒可數，徒以非正式規定靠站，不售客票，致可望而不可即！此事雖經地方商號及黨團機關一再備文請求，然迄將匝月未荷批准。在路局方面容有調度困難之苦衷，惟爲多數普通民衆謀便利計，並爲减除四十二資客車擁擠危險計，（乘客由車窗爬出爬入或攀登車頂視爲尋常事）實有努力解除困難之必要，請路局方面考慮，在不妨礙行車時刻之範園內，（譬如因誤點等待交換而停靠爲例）准該次區間車經常停靠莘站一分鐘，發售客票，以符國營交通，便利大衆之主旨。若然，則泗涇顓橋等處旅客將咸蒙其利，非僅莘莊一地爲然也。（逸凡）</p>

<h3>顧維鈞提醒歐美政治家　亞洲地位不容漠視　蘇對裁軍案不難與美協調</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十二日電〕美英蘇三國外長昨夜在外國報界協會之宴會席上發言，各抒見解。中國駐美大使顧維鈞亦出席發言稱：「默美之政治家將承認亞洲今日所盡之重大任務，而繼續爲全世界之和平與幸福而努力」。並云，亞洲醒覺之微象極多，並極重要，凡屬有思想之政治家，均不能予以忽視。渠謂：菲律濱共和國之興起與印度之即將獲得獨立，以及印尼與越南之要求自治，均爲亞洲在世界事務巾即將起重大作用之明證。渠又云：「爲求實現聯合國之崇高任務起見，東方之組織與合作，其需要與西方者相埒。藉此更密切之合作，別成立人類議會與世界聯邦之理想，必有實現之一日」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十二日電〕蘇聯外長莫洛托夫昨晚在外國報界宴席上聲稱：普天下人民實在均望和平，觀於若　在戰時之努力，實應使彼等享有和平。普　裁軍乃爲當前急務，關於此事，蘇聯已向聯合國提出，美國亦有類似計劃，蘇聯代表團擬與美代表團成立協議，使兩項提案和諧，竊以爲此一問題，可在本屆聯大會中解決，大會如能商定完善之計劃，即可終止業已開始之軍備競爭，且可减輕各國人民之軍費負擔，而提高彼等之生活標準，事之善者莫甚於此　美國務卿貝爾納斯稱，美國人民選舉新國會，並不欲改變外交政策。吾國之外交政策旣非民主黨者亦非共和黨者，乃爲全體美國人者，他國政府倘以爲此次選舉美國人民欲改變外交政策之表示，則大錯特錯矣。</p>
<p>英外相貝文繼起發言，略謂　言和平，於事未足，必須出以絕大之努力確保和平，以　國際約束受尊重，乃克有濟。以裁軍一事而論，第一次世界大戰後，英國率先創導，但英國之片面行動幾釀成大禍。今日有人指摘英國希望利用原子能製造破壞性武器云云，絕非事實，吾國僅望本身工業恢復繁榮云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十二日廣播：蘇外長莫洛托夫昨晚聲稱：蘇聯準備讓步，以謀在世界解除軍備方面與美國成立折衷辦法，藉此保證世界之持久和平。美國務卿貝爾納斯對於草洛托夫之妥協態度，並未置評，而强調上週美國選舉之結果，並不影響美國外交政策。</p>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖十二日電〕包括禁止私造軍火之美國世界軍縮計劃，將近草擬就緒，日內即提出於聯合國大會。衆料美國此項建議將交與聯合國軍事參謀委員會處理，該會由五强組成，負責聯合國際警察隊事項。</p>
<p>蘇代表在託管會　抨擊英美及南非</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十一日電〕蘇聯代表諾維柯夫今日在託管委員會演說，批評英國來能將巴勒斯坦移交聯合國託管，同時對於美國所提代管太平洋前日本代管各島草的，亦認爲與託管制不合。諾氏致詞歷一小時之久，英美及南非代表立即繼起發言反駁，美代表率直指責蘇聯始終阻碍託管理事會之組成。</p>
<p>關於巴勒斯坦問題，諾維柯夫演說稱，該地命遝如何，現尙懸而未決。英國未能將該處託管草的提出，蘇聯願知其故，蘇聯深知英國對此已不能自圓其說。現有一事已屬明顯，即英政府已在聯合國機構之外，一方面與美國，另一方面與阿刺伯及猶太人分別談判，解決此問題，此種行徑實屬有乖聯合國憲章。諾氏旋稱，美國對於太平洋方面前日太代管島所提出之託管草的，實屬自相矛盾，現在所提出之託管草的僅屬「表示意響」而已。託管理事會應於本屆大會期內成立，諾氏演說以英澳及南非爲攻擊主體，謂託管理事會之未能成立，受國聯委治各國應負其責。諾氏續稱，南非聯邦欲將西南非委治地合併，乃直接違反聯合國憲章之條文與原則。蘇聯將反對合併之要求，並將堅持南非提出西南非託管草的</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十二日電〕四外長昨夜賡續會議，由法代表繆維爾輪値主席，討論問是以匈牙利賠款爲主。貝爾納斯宣稱，美國擬以目前美國所佔用之匈牙利船隻，全部退回原主。英外相貝文旋即提出匈羅保三國境內盟軍將來之撤退問題。最後討論芬蘭和的，同意芬蘭政府應對蘇賠款三億美元。四外長上星期迭次會議，共檢討巴黎和會通過之議案六十五件，其中六件已採納，五件交回各外長代表繼續研究，另一件撤消。</p>

<h3>蘇國外駐軍　現有二百萬　遠較英美合并之數爲多</h3>
<p>〔聯合社　的十一日電〕、美戰時諜報員倫特，在十一月號「新領袖雜誌」發表一文，據稱蘇聯尙有現役軍隊三百萬人以上，其中二百萬人駐　國境以外。蘇聯在「非敵國」境內駐軍在四十四萬五千名至四十八萬名之問，所謂「非敵國，」　蘇聯要求盟國駐軍員額應由聯合國調查之各國。英國在此種國家內駐軍十九萬五千人，美國駐軍十三萬二千人。蘇聯國外駐軍集中於波蘭，至</p>
<p>於南斯拉夫及阿爾巴尼亞方面則僅駐一萬名，捷克境內所駐蘇軍在五千至一萬人之間。伊朗亞塞爾拜然省仍有蘇軍一萬人。中國方面恐已不復　蘇聯軍隊。</p>
<p>英國在非敵性國駐軍員額如下：希腦五萬人，中國五千人，埃及十萬人，東印度二萬五千人，伊拉克及外的但一萬五千人。美國在歐洲非敵性國境內並無軍隊，但在其他非敵國之駐軍員額如下：冰島與格陵蘭二千人，巴拿馬五萬人，菲律賓五萬人，中國三萬人。</p>
<p>蘇聯在以前各敵國之駐軍，甚至亦遠較英美合併之數爲多，即蘇聯爲一百五十三萬五千人，英美爲五十二萬人。蘇聯在德國駐軍七十二萬五千人，英軍僅卅五萬人，美軍僅廿九萬人。奧境駐有蘇軍六萬五千人，英軍二萬八千人，，美軍一萬五千人。義大利方面並無蘇軍，英軍則有四萬五千人，美軍二萬五千人。匈羅保芬四國境內，並無英美軍隊，蘇軍則有四十七萬人。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕共和黨領袖今日預言：參院明年一月集會時，將以大多數擁護國務卿貝爾納斯與參議員范登堡所推行之外交政策。共和黨新議員十二人均爲熱心擁護國際合作者。共和黨參議員鮑爾稱：選舉結果足以增强主張美國參加世界政治各議員之地位。惟此外亦有各種徵象，證明在經濟上援助他國之建議，將續遭共和黨强烈反對。杜魯門總統昨日闡明政見後，共和黨領袖迅即保證予以合作。馬丁的瑟一月間將任衆院議長，今日宣稱：我人歡迎與杜魯門總統合作，美國在國際政治中，必須保持其不偏不倚之立塲。共和黨中央委員會主席李斯亦稱：杜魯門總統允許以善意報答善意，此爲美國人民所應同聲讚美者。</p>

<h3>紀念國父誕辰　各界舉行大會　大光明會塲佈置莊嚴肅穆　吳市長闡述總理遺囑意義</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲國父誕辰，上午九時本市各界假大光明戲院舉行紀念大會，並慶祝國大之召開。到吳國楨，謝仁釗，徐寄　，谷春帆，水祥雲，李熙謀，李劍華，馮友眞，汪竹一，及各機關團體學校代表千餘人。會塲佈置莊嚴肅穆，正中　國父道　及黨國旗，四週圍以　花電炬，兩壁掛有「全國統一，世界和平。」「還政於民，還軍於國。」「實施民主憲政，完成國民革命。」「恪遵國父遺敎，召開國民大會。」「慶祝國父誕辰，實現民主政治。」「慶祝國大開幕，奠定憲政基礎。」等標語。</p>
<p>行禮如儀後主席吳市長致詞，略謂今日紀念國父誕辰，憶及國父遺囑中指示革命之目的，在求中國之自由平等。過去我國外受日本帝國主義之欺凌及不平等條約之束縛，內遭軍閥之割據壓制，故國父遺囑最後兩句爲廢除不平等條約及召開國民會議。不平等條約經八年抗戰業已達到廢除之目的。現召開國民大會，即求還政於民，結束訓政時期，進至憲政時期，使人民獲得自由平等。故如反對國民大會者，即爲破壞民主之大敵。現聞國大又展期三日，我人急切希望三日後能如期召開，以實現國父遺敎而達到眞正之自由平等。</p>
<p>謝仁釗致詞</p>
<p>繼由市黨部書記官謝仁釗致詞稱：國父一生革命目的在求平等自由，對外取消不平等條約，對內召開國民大會。前者經八年苦戰，可以告慰者業已完成，後者此次召開又告延期，乃因政府秉承國父和平奮鬥救中國之遺志，忍讓爲國而求和平團結。國大目的在於開始憲政還政於民，爲唯一合法代表全國人民之機關。人民係國家之主人，任何黨派決不應以軍隊武力干涉政治，應以議會代表替戰塲，化干戈爲玉帛。我國抗戰八年即爲求憲政之實施，尙望全國人民一致擁護，使其不致流產。未謂三民主義非獨爲救中國之主義，且爲救世界之主義，唯三民主義可使社會主義民主化，資本主義社會化，故適合於世界潮流，幷合乎人民需要。三民主義之實現，可避免第三次世界大戰之發生。今日紀念國父誕辰，全國人民應努力實現國父遺敎，使全人類達到自由幸福之理想。</p>
<p>謝氏詞畢，宣　吾，徐寄　，亦相繼發表演說，闡述國父遺敎及召開國大之意義。最後由吳市長宣讀致國民大會電，全禮一致鼓掌通過，並呼口號後散會。</p>
<p>電賀國民大會</p>
<p>致國大電文如下：「急，南京國民大會鈞鑒，今值國父八一誕辰，貴會即將在京開幕，羣賢畢集總望所歸，承先啓後，由訓政而憲政，繼往開來，由整軍而建國，恪遵國父之遺敎，永奠民生之丕基，謹承主席之昭示，共立復興大業，雲天遙企，曷勝欽佩，特電馳賀，藉表微忱。上海市各界慶祝國父誕辰大會（文）叩。」</p>
<p>最後由主席團領導全體高呼大會口號：一，慶祝國父誕辰。二，擁護國民大會。三，實行國父遺敎。四，完成民主憲政。五，鞏固和平統一。六，擴大冬令救濟。七，還政於民還軍於國。八，三民主義萬歲。九，中華民國萬歲。於樂聲中宣佈散會，時爲十時四十分，至大會於前日預定之遊行節目，則以國大延期，故亦臨時中止舉行。</p>

<h3>社會服務　讀者諮詢</h3>
<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>（一）押地回贖</p>
<p>朱鴻逸問　茲有兄弟二人已分家，弟因在外經商，故將所分得之田八畝及房屋一間於民國二十年時，以四百元押與其兄並言明隨時可以取贖，於今十有五年，其弟忽向其史要求贖回是項產業，然幣值相差懸殊，請問應如何處理？</p>
<p>〔秦聯奎律師答〕　抵借契約不定淸償期而許債務人隨時取還抵押物，因債務人延不淸償，致遇情事變更。如以抵借時同數量之貨幣淸償債務，顯失公平時，債權人得依情事變更之法則，請求法院爲增加給付之判決。但欲即以抵產受償，則須雙方另訂契約，不能單以債權人之意思，移轉抵押物之所有權。</p>
<p>（二）棄舊迎新</p>
<p>吳敏時間　敝友某君與甲女結　已逾八載，並生有子女各一，然甲女性情乖戾，夫婦間情感極爲淡薄，前年秋某君邂逅乙女，相識之下，兩人意氣相投，未幾即由友誼而發生戀愛，孰料爲乙女識破隱情，某君即與其妻提出離婚要求，先則甲某君甘言哄騙，曾作口頭允諾，並簽字於某君書就之離婚書（無證人），及復始知受騙，乃對某君提出質問，然二人感情業已破裂。某君仳離之意益堅，請問此事，就法律觀點應如何解決？</p>
<p>〔秦聯奎律師答〕　茲就所問分兩點答覆，（一）兩願離婚，應以書面爲之，並應有二人以上之簽名。所稱之離婚紙，旣無證人，洵非合法。（二）訴請離婚須有下列情形之一；即一，重婚；二，與人通姦者；三，夫妻之一方受他方不堪同居之虐待者；四，妻對於夫之直系尊親屬，爲虐待或受夫之直系尊親屬之虐待致不堪爲共同生活者；五，夫妻之一方以惡意遺棄他方在繼續狀態中者；六，夫妻之一方意圖殺害他方者；七，有不治之惡疾者；八，有重大不治之精神病者；九，生死不明已逾三年者；十，被處三年以上之徒刑或因犯不名譽之罪被處徒刑者。</p>

<h3>小學運動會第一日　隆重熱烈揭開序幕</h3>
<p>二萬小學生參加表演競賽　今明兩日繼續舉行</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕市敎育局主辦上海市第十屆小學聯合運動會，昨日上午十時，假虹口中正公圍舉行開幕式，參加學生，計二萬餘人，爲勝利後首次盛况，吳市長特親自蒞臨致訓，大會原定於昨晨九時舉行，臨時因各校參加團體操學生衆多，集合困難，以及大會名界會長吳市長，參加在大光明舉行之國父誕辰紀念會，故延遲至十時廿分始吿揭幕，市府何秘書畏，敎育局李副局長，以及大會全體職員，均親臨會塲，新疆觀光團亦到塲參觀，各校學生，草木精神抖擻，觀衆之多，更爲勝利後，體育界空前未有之盛况。</p>
<p>隆重開幕禮</p>
<p>全體職員運動員有先繞塲一週，　　敎養所樂像於軍樂悠揚聲中，由大會會務主任朱君惕，副主任　詢牧，廬冠六，總幹事邵汝幹，領導全體職員裁判曁全體運動員繞塲，校旗招展，步伐整齊，蔚爲大觀。繞塲畢奏國歌，行升旗禮。敎育局李副局長熙謀代表顧敎局長致開會詞，會務主任朱君惕報告籌備經過，繼之運動員宣誓畢，大會名譽會長吳市長及敎育部代表張天麟等，先後致訓詞，運動員於儀式完畢後，即整隊離塲，六千人大會操於是時即行開始，動作整齊，姿勢美妙，原定於上午舉行之田徑賽因爲時已晏，乃改至下午一時開始。各組田徑賽均能順利進行。惟鉛球因參加者有冒名頂替及渝磅者，故須待今日大會解決，跳高因競爭劇烈，至天黑尙未見分曉，亦決定改在今日合併舉行。吳市長致訓詞（本報攝）</p>
<p>李熙謀致開幕詞</p>
<p>大會副會長李熙謀氏致開會詞，略謂：「受敎育不僅爲念書，求知識，更要鍜鍊身體，要有體育。今天有這樣多的小學生，參加運動會，我們方才覺得敎育有意義。本人乘此機會，說明兩點感想：第一，我們要更進一步提倡體育，使上海全體市民都參加運動會。第二，運動曾每年不過舉行一二次，爲期也不過兩三天，我們更要時時刻刻注意每天的體育，要切記體育不是以比賽爲目的，而以鍛鍊身體爲目的。」報吿籌備經過</p>
<p>繼由大會會務主任朱君惕氏報吿籌備經過，略謂：「本屆運動會距上一屆達十年，於一月前由敎育局局務會議通過，經市長批准後，即積極開始籌備，時間很短，經費也不多，但本屆參加的人數極多，大會操參加者六十一校，一百十七組，五千八百五十人。團體操參加者七十六校，共一百二十六節，學生六千八百十七人，敎員一百四十七人。田徑賽參加者一百十七校，二千三百餘人」。</p>
<p>吳市長致訓詞</p>
<p>報吿畢，由吳市長致訓詞稱：「今天有這樣多小朋友和來賓參加運動會，是中國進步的好現象，我們雖然廢除了不平等條約，但是，在體格上我們仍不能和外國人平等。我們要多多鍜鍊，今天本人有兩句話要說，第一不希望成績好，希望體育運動能普及。第二，不要爭勝負，要學會守紀律，守秩序。」</p>
<p>繼由敎育部代表國民敎育司帮辦張天麟致訓詞，就運動與民族壽命，運動與整個國防，運動與競爭道德三點有所發揮。最後由何德奎氏致訓詞稱：今日小朋友精神奮發，大家皆有極好訓練，辦理如此大規模運動會，井井有條，可見組織周密。</p>

<h3>雷樹蘋臨了一頂　優游戰和青白隊　一比一逸園足球出冷門</h3>
<p>甲組足球聯賽，靑白與優游，昨日下午三時相逢一於逸園球塲，球迷五千餘人，情况熟烈，競爭結果，上半時靑白由李義臣射入一球，下半時終塲前一分鐘時，優游雷樹苹頭頂，扳成和局，殊出球迷意料之外。戰情緊張，一時無兩，優游嚴守，卒使靑白未獲成就。</p>
<p>青白先攻</p>
<p>李義臣統率諸鋒，入優游腹地，右翼姜　清獲小顧之傳，遙射中央，李義臣乘機叩門，拉蒂衝出營救，竟成空門，幸張榮廣救駕，化險爲夷。十分鐘時，小羅左角吊中，李義臣操之過急，徒勞而返。優游反攻，王南珍左路起義，受阻於吳祺祥，混戰至十八分鐘時，阿奎小傳羅壽福，羅再傳中，顧以撒虛擺華容道，李司開於近門處力射，拉蒂不防，遂吿失陷，一比〇靑白</p>
<p>記錄首開</p>
<p>時毛鴻發受傷離塲，維拉入替，接觸後，優游雲逢　中路興兵，遙傳前綫，維拉扣住射門，稍高野逸，未幾，維拉傳中，雷樹苹叩門，中秦必高懷抱，靑白乘機進襲，姜　淸單刀深入，近門猛攻，幸拉蒂眼快接住，未遭毒手，未幾，上半時吿終，靑白以一比〇佔先。</p>
<p>休息再戰</p>
<p>優游人馬，小有更動，王春江退休，王南珍后移，朱梅龍補南珍職位，青白前鋒，許文奎與顧以撒對調，兩陣再圓，優游腹地，祗見敵騎縱橫，李義臣，羅壽福顧以撒環攻不下，勃里尼張榮廣左右招架，備見忙碌，十分鐘時，李義臣遙射球出如矢，拉蒂躍起接住，陳效平反攻，曹琴芳劉始讚左輔右弼，惜乎個子太矮，嚴士鑫，吳祺祥，鐵閘一雙，難越雷池，二十分鐘時，顧以撒左角射門，未見功成，至廿五分鐘時，吳祺祥誤撞曹琴芳，判罰任意球，離門的卅碼，勃里尼主罰，中秦必高欽抱，未幾，琴芳得始　接濟，於人叢中射門，又被必高撲出，四十分鐘時，吳祺祥受傷離塲薛沛然入替，琴芳</p>
<p>乘虛而入，孟義良阻成角球，維拉右角開來，雷樹苹冷路竄出，迎頭一頂，竟入網內，一比一優游扳成和局，未一分鐘，法定時間終了，靑白優游戰成和局。雙方陣綫如下：</p>
<p>靑白</p>
<p>秦必高　嚴土鑫　吳祺祥上　薛沛然下　　永福　孟義良　高保正　許文奎　羅夀福　李義臣　顧以　　姜問清</p>

<p>黑白隊在菲島爲華僑球壇勁旅，該隊在馬尼刺，歷史頗爲悠久，曾先後獲得各項錦標，出征怡埠時，更獲好評，來滬後，排日在市體育館操練，球塲情形，已漸穩熟，隊長傅永信，中鋒蕭華陀，身手尤爲敏捷，林之儀　射，施榮螺長守，今日出馬，當能一新滬上球迷耳目。三塲秩序如下：十三日（星期三）黑白—仁餘（男子）六時半十四日（星期四）黑白—雪白（女子）六時半（採女子規則）十五日（星期五）黑白—一征輪（男子）六時半</p>

<h3>配紗的實用問題</h3>
<p>粗紗多細紗不少易配合實用　複配會希望同業能調整製品</p>
<p>紗廠公會與棉紗複製品工業公會配紗委員會所合作之配紗工作，已達第三次。第一次爲十月二十八日，各種支數五千八百零三件。第二次爲本月四日，各種支數五千六百二十六件二五。第三次爲本月十一日，各種支數五千四百六十四件。每次各申合二十支標準六千零二件。複製工業屢以申請之支數與受配之支數不盡相符，頗有煩言。據紗廠業方面消息，云係按各廠生產情形撥派。紡管會正在等候複配會之淸册，重謀調整。據複配會消息，第一次配紗開始前染織，針織，內衣，毛巾被毯，手工棉織等六業所造報之申請册子，十六支以下之粗紗爲四百零九件，二十支大路貨爲三·〇八八件二五，卅二支至四十二支中等細紗爲一·六一九件五，六十支以上上等細紗爲四十七件。紗廠每次撥配之紗，總是粗紗溢額過巨，中等細紗缺額太甚。最近之一期，則二十支大路貨亦僅得原申請額之三分之二稍强。而十六支以下之粗紗共達一千三百四十件，則超過原申請額三倍有餘。其中十支一種，原申請爲二十餘件，此次派七七六件，則超過三十六倍以上。以致中等及上等細紗益缺。而中等細紗亦係中小工廠織造綫呢及針織品，內衣手帕等，通用之大路貨。其不敷分配，尤屬不便。複配會曾商請　業酌量調整，上次且於領配後則將十支紗退還三百數十件，而此次不特不减，反更見增加，深感棘手。　紡建公司方面撥配之紗，曾力求與複製品業之實用相接近，細紗尤得其維持之力，複配會對之表示滿意。據複配會負責人潘士浩氏所表示之意見，撥配與承配二方面應互相容忍，互相諒解，以謀合作。粗紗之多，在紗廠方面自必有相當之株因，希望同業能調整其　品，以容納此項原料。故上次與此次曾各酌　二百數十件。惟同時希望紗廠業注意此事實上之兩難，予以恊助云，　吳市長早經表示，配紗必須求其與實用相含，從下次起當有調整之辦法也。</p>
<h3>人造絲配售不足　中信調查迄今尙未完竣　小廠搜購引起黑市漲風</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：中央信託局第二批人造絲二千箱，業已在日裝船啓運來華，日內當可抵滬，以供配銷，而平絲價。據估計：中信局首批人造絲四千八百箱，迄月前爲止，總共不過配去二千箱之譜。二批日本人造絲二千箱運到後，其總存額已足敷年內之配銷量云。</p>
<p>又人造絲日前因供不應求，又告騰漲。據悉：絲織業公會各會員彙送中央信託局十一月份之申請單，中信局以迄未調查完竣，故發配額暫較上月份爲短少。而紡建公司自上週起，亦開始停配。各小廠以配貨不繼，而一方面又迫於生產需要，乃只得向市塲搜購，遂又造成持貨者拾價之機會。</p>
<h3>絲織業貸款　機器不許作抵押　押款到期可通融</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市絲織業公會所屬會員三七五家，自經四聯總處批准，尤其申請貸款後，該業公會方面，曾一度向中央銀行申請准許以機器作抵。茲悉是項請求，己遭央行否決。各廠如欲申請貸款，仍須以原料照市三折，或製成品照市價七折作抵。微聞當局爲體卹商艱，允於押款期滿時，另擬融通辦法。存款期限爲三個月，按月息五分計息。由中國交通兩銀行承貸。其他如中央信託局，則搭放於中國銀行。中國農民銀行則搭放於交通銀行。各搭放行局之貸款，佔各承貸行貸款總額之四成。各承貸行仍得以抵押品七折向央行辦理轉抵押，按月息三分計算。</p>
<h3>營業稅太重　捲煙業求改章　土布業亦求豁免</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會以本市捲菸批發商營業稅負担奇重，特應該業同業公會之請，呈請財政局改變片收營業稅辦法，並請求取締里街口無店號無執照之烟店及馬路烟攤，以保護正當商業。至於課征營業稅之新辦法，捲菸業公會建議兩個：（一）另訂捲烟營業稅簡化課征辦法，在廠方派貨單所派酌量及派價，繕具應納簡化課征之營業稅款單，携往財政局一次繳納應納稅款。或（二）特訂捲烟營業稅征收率，照各批發其所得之利潤，作爲　征之標準</p>
<p>又本市土布商同業公會，以上布之生產者與消費者，均爲貧民，不堪營業稅之負担，特轉請市商會呈請財部准予免征。並致電商聯會代爲呼籲。</p>
<h3>紗銷統計　九十兩月份</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕茲據中國紡建公司業務處調查，本年十月份本市棉紗銷售本帮及客　之統計數字，計成交總額爲三九、〇〇〇件，惟實銷總額爲三三、九〇〇件。此項數字中，本市佔一四、四〇五件，長江沿岸佔八、八九五件，華南佔七、三六〇件，京滬杭佔五、三六五件，華北佔二、九七五件。又九月份棉紗之成交總額爲五四、三〇〇件，實銷總額爲四一、〇〇〇件。</p>
<h3>運茶困於手續　當業請分別改良</h3>
<p>自政府准許外銷貨物，暫行具何記賬起運，與限期三月內出口，逾期由保證商號負責繳稅辦法後，運茶出口貿易一項，已有轉機，唯因保證書，規定由其他商店担保，商人頗感困難，同時因貨物機關辦事遲緩，且多數朱均未有稅務機關人員，以致浙江該業各商已製成箱茶一萬餘箱，均在蒿壩曹娥等地堆積，無法出口，現滬杭各茶商，正向政府要求，保證書手續改同業聯保，駐塲人員，請稅局應先設置，其已製成箱茶，因稅務關係未能趕先運申，幷請上海農行予以證明。</p>
<h3>杉木步漲</h3>
<p>木材市况，杉木漲風疉起，因福建產地來源困難，市價好起，洋松因國外傳電有劇漲消息，賣方多止售，市况堅穩。</p>
<h3>北貨業交易淸淡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕北貨業中之紅黑棗胡桃等品，江浙人民，多備爲冬令食補之用。年常旺季，以夏　九十兩　爲頂峯。蓋是時客帮均來滬挅辦，以備入冬應銷。惟據業中人談：北貨業近來情况平淡無奇。各貨市價趨勢平疲。據談：該業各貨主要來源，爲隴海綫一帶。較著名者，有天津及山東濟南之紅黑棗，杏仁，瓜子，胡桃等。該兩地近有招商局貨輸居間運輸，故互貨尙稱通暢。次如蘇北高郵等地之金針菜，花生，瓜子等，大多自鎭揚江陰等地轉來。近來因蘇北地方轉靖，到貨亦較前通暢。惜本年天時晚寒，而一般農村之購買力，因糧價平賤，亦大爲削弱。影響所及，客銷遂呈銷路。該業人氏以近來市面各業蕭條，故瞻望今冬該業前途，恐亦無法擺脫不景氣之桎梏云。</p>

<h3>察晉綏視察記　長城內外（二）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　杭舟</p>
<p>十二戰區的部隊不多，或許是全國各戰區中部隊最少的一個。單論兵力，傅氏遠非共軍晋綏察冀陝五省聯防總指揮賀龍與晋冀察總指揮聶榮臻之敵。十二戰區的轄區是綏遠全部，察哈爾全部，晋北十三縣及陝北楡林一帶。如此遼闊的防區，傅氏只有兩個軍：三五軍和暫三軍，還有一個騎兵師和一個補充師，此外，有由第二戰區劃歸傅氏指揮的守大同的三十八師及馬占山將軍的騎兵第五師與第六師。至共軍方面，賀龍，聶榮臻所部兵力共十五萬人以上。傅氏以少敵衆，把賀龍，聶榮臻部逐往大行山中。這是將士用命，和獲得民衆的協力所致。所以他稱晋察綏國共軍決戰的集寗會戰爲：</p>
<p>〔人民意志與士兵憤恨心理之勝利！〕</p>
<p>大同·集寧·張垣三部曲</p>
<p>引起集寗會戰的，是共軍於八月三日起向大同瘋在的進攻。如果大同失守，不祇太原吿警，綏包有再度被圍可能。傅作義氏那時坐鎭歸綏，數次電請中共當局停止進攻大同，否則恐怕會因此引起大戰。電勸無效於八月下旬派山西大學敎授周北風氏往集寧，豐鎭，面勸賀龍，蕭克等停止進兵，此人到了張垣便下落不明，而大同外圍之戰事却愈演愈烈。大同孤軍苦守，情勢岌岌可危。傅氏迫不得已，在歸綏召開團長以上將領會議，商討對策。各將領發出一致的怒吼：「解救大同」！</p>
<p>於是董其武將軍奉令率三師人馬：卅一師，十七師，十一師，自綏包出兵，另以一〇一師爲後援隊，九月五號首與共軍戰於卓資山。國軍以沉痛之心情進兵，所謂不戰則已，旣戰，則哀兵必勝！卓資山共軍奉令死守兩天，國軍於兩小時半以內就拿了下來，續沿平綏路向集寗挺進。集寗地勢險峻，有最堅固之工事。城郊幾個主要的據點：老虎山，臥能山，鐵軍山，都有鋼骨水泥構築的碉堡，並有五層各種形狀的鐵絲網，電網，兩道外壕，城內各街道，各家屋，亦均築有巷戰工事。共軍聚集兵力在該處，達十七個旅，五十一個團，宣稱將殲滅國軍。</p>
<p>集寗之戰於九月十日慘烈展開。十二戰區的部隊雖已整編，但均無新式配備，使用的仍係陳舊的武器，攻擊如此現代化工事，付出的代價是鉅大的。兩軍層層包圍，董其武將軍亦被包圍在共軍圈內，兩天兩夜沒有吃一點東西。兩軍混戰中，受過嚴格訓練的國軍，發揮出嫻熟的戰鬥技術，各自爲戰，一以當十，奮勇無比。共軍傷亡重大，但仍憑籍工事頑抗。喋血四畫夜後，國軍差不多快要支持不住，但國軍支持不住時，亦正是共軍將要潰退之際，當此千鈞一髮，國軍後援隊——一〇一師適時趕上，加人戰鬥，一舉攻佔各主要據點，於十四日完全收復集寗。陳屍戰塲的共軍達二萬三千七百人，傷者倍之。國軍傷亡約五千人。</p>
<p>集寗旣下，共軍主力大半已這擊潰，大同之　繼之而解，去張垣之路亦已吿敞開，但國軍並不繼續前進，給共黨一個機會，希望他們接受蔣主席停戰十日恢復商談的提議，可惜共黨加以拒絕了；同時，又大肆宣傳，要以五十萬兵力固守張垣，並要在懷來附近殲滅孫迎仲將軍的部隊。這無異是又一次的挑戰的舉動。</p>
<p>董其武率領下的四師在集寗停留廿日，把綏遠境內的共軍肅淸了。廿日以後——十一月五日，他們開始向張垣進發。事前，他們獲得了共軍的情報，係在鐵路錢佈置重兵，長城綫則甚空虛。便迂廻了五十華里，急行軍自北南下，完全出乎共軍意料之外。一口氣衝到張北，城裏的共軍尙在歌舞作樂，對數萬人的大兵團調動全不知情，措手不及，被國軍殲滅大半。長城綫諸要塞，如狼窩溝，神威台等地，均經國軍速戰速決，一瀉而下，銳不可當，以七日之時間，進展五百里，十一日上午十一時五十分不戰而入張垣，共軍守將聶榮臻「臨去秋波」，縱火而逃。這一把火燒得慘，給張垣人民留下了永恒的仇恨的烙痕。</p>
<p>共軍攻大同時，曾使用毒彈，圖爲中毒之國軍士兵</p>
<p>燒剩了的張垣車站</p>
<h3>破碎的張垣</h3>
<p>我們以半天的時間，觀察張垣刦後情况。在那些被燒毁的堅固的建築前面，在那些被損害的精巧而龐大的機器前面，……刦後的人民含着眼淚指點着我們憑吊，我們一一接受了他們的眼淚；我們又從他們的臉上看到了憤怒，我們亦一一接受了他們的憤怒。　在華北視察，我深深感覺到日本人對於華北是具有永佔的企圖的，所以他們着重建設，致力開發；對於華中和華南則差一點勁。在張垣，日本八年來的建設已經相當可觀。戰敗的日本投降了，許多建設原封不動地讓我們接收。如果，我們利用這些日本人的建設，作爲建國的一部份資本，或許人民的生活已有了改善。但共產黨不願意這樣；它自稱「代表人民的利益，」實際上，却不知道與中國人民有多大仇恨，到處要把人民的生機切斷。它在張垣敗退，便縱火焚城，似乎非這樣做不可。（被共軍竊踞而後又敗退的城市所遭遇的厄運是一樣的）。但它所燒毁的並不是屬於它認爲敵對的國民黨政府的東西，（它祇不過使國民黨政府加重責任而已）；它所燒毀的乃是屬於國家與人民的東西。假使共產黨不是以整個國家和愛國的人民爲敵實在沒有理由這樣做』如果說，使整個中國經濟破產是共產黨「革命」的基礎，以使窮苦的人非跟着它打家刦舍不能生活，那它更是不智！我所看到的是：連最貧窮的人提起共產黨，——不，受難的人民稱之爲「破產黨」—都睜着怒火的眼睛了！</p>
<p>根據十二戰區臨時政務委員會的調査統計表巾所列張垣原有之公司和工廠，如電業公司，石油公司，麵粉廠等共四十家中，僅有自來水公司未遭破壞，據當地人吿記者，滬是因爲共軍來不及破壞的緣故。其餘的，或遭全部毁損，或遭部份損害。張垣主要的工業區是在宣化和下花園，那裏所有的工廠機件，亦均遭毁損。尤其是下花園的發電廠，兩萬克羅瓦特的發電機遭受澈底的破壞。總共損失的數字是無法統計的。天知道那一天能够恢復舊觀！</p>
<p>循着路綫，我們先看原有三百克羅瓦特發電機的北發電廠。工人們正在檢拾零件，修理配裝。處在閙區的民生電業股份有限公司，僅存一個焦黃的外壳。電話局裏毁損的機件狼籍滿地，原有自動話機四千部，被共軍運走了一批，餘悉遭焚燬。現在交通部電話局只帶來手搖機三十一號，在維持電話交通。幾個女接綫員已是「三朝元老」。在閒談中她們吿訴我：「八路軍比日本人的心還要狠些。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽」？我驚異地問。</p>
<p>她們把眼睛掃在被毁壞的機件上，再向我望望，意思彷彿吿訴我：」你早應該知道了」！</p>
<h3>「敗家子」炸水塔　把工人的腦筋震醒過來</h3>
<p>我們到了火車站，觸目都是傷心：傾倒的水塔，支離破碎的車頭和車廂，只剩了幾根焦木的站房和那些在殘垣頹壁中嘆氣的工人的臉。一個七十多歲的工人說：八路軍燒車站，的在國軍到來前二日的晚上，他睡在坑上，被一片火光驚醒，數一數，一共起了十二個火頭。他眼見着他生活的「伙伴」，——那車站上的一切，全完了，他沒有一點主意，憤恨得使他羞愧，他羞愧看見中國人在自己的國土上，做出這樣沒出息的事！想往火裏跳！八路軍炸水塔用了二十多噸黃色藥，天崩地裂似地一聲響，把　的腦筋反而震淸楚了，他指着水塔，向我們說：「俺在敵人的屈辱下把它建立起來；現在被敗家子把它破壞了！先生，俺要重新建設它！你動工時，可不要忘了我」</p>
<p>被炸燬了的水塔（特派員杭州寄）</p>
<p>被破壞了的張垣大鐵橋</p>
<h3>大鐵橋慘遭腰斬　像一個半身不送的病人</h3>
<p>張家口大鐵橋，是一個偉大的工程，橋有一里多長。我們看到它時，它已被腰斬，像一個半身不遂的病人。共軍對這橋使用的破壞方法是十分奇特的，大槪只有進過『破壞大學」的共產黨人才想得出。</p>
<p>鐵橋的中央放置了黃色的炸藥，兩頭有兩個車頭對駛過來。其中一個火車頭的駕駛員，在揩一揩眼淚之後，把機器弄壞了一部份，那個車頭被停留在橋頭，不曾前進；另一個車頭的駕駛員無可奈何地開足了馬力，他自己則先跳下了車。車頭開至中央，碰發了炸藥，被炸成碎片，橋像一根甘庶似地被炸斷了一節，碎片落在已經乾涸的淸河水上，像要替共產黨拿手的傑作，作永久的證明。　平綏鐵路管理局機務段的負責人，對以張垣爲中心，東至懷來，西至陽高，東西沿綫被破壞的情形，有一個總的調査報吿（一）東綫破壞情形：甲，橋樑及涵洞四十二座。所有橋上鋼軌，枕木，魚尾板，道釘，羅絲，大部遺失·乙，綫路損壞約二十公里，鋼軌損失約五百五十餘條，枕木損失的一萬八千餘根。丙，沿綫各站建筑房舍，除寧遠站外，盡遭焚燬。（二）西綫破壞情形：甲，橋樑及涵洞一百五十餘座，破壞者幾爲全部。乙，鋼軌損失的八九百條，沈木大多數皆無，電桿全部被毁，柴溝堡及天鎭水塔全崩。（三）設備破壞情形：甲，機車破壞大小十六台。乙，客車破壞十二輛，貨車一百十七輛。丙，所有器械，百分之八十被共軍運走，餘者亦半數以上被崩毁。</p>
<p>「平綏路之父」詹天佑氏如果地下有知，我想他一定會槌胸痛哭！</p>
<p>經路局搶修之下，張垣北平之間的可於本月中旬通車；張垣至大同之間，則因破壞嚴里，修復費工費料，現正徵購材料，僱用民伕，分段進行搶修，預計尙需一月始可完成。</p>
<p>受時間的限制，我們所看到的僅是被破壞的十分之一二，但我們已經够了。一幅悲慘圖畫，已經在我的腦中形成。這幅岡書在我的眼前不時移動，忽然變了一個樣子，我彷彿看見周恩來先生和中共在京滬的其他各位「口若懸河」的先生，在會議席上高喊「民主」，「自由」，「和平」，「幸福」等等口號的神態。我沒有閒惰逸緻諷剌他們，我只覺得周恩來等等先生如果知道他的「同志們」在人民生活所依的土地上幹着什麼勾當時，他一定失去了那份「大言不慚」的勇氣，否則，他一定是歇斯底里的患者。　（九日）</p>

<h3>六十萬猶太人支持的　猶太國民運動　將迫使英方改變態度</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯自世界報告　南</p>
<p>巴勒期坦全境有發生遊擊戰爭的危險，猶太人和回敎徒各趨極端，絕無妥協的餘地，英國究竟偏袒那一面，確屬是値得注意的問題，對於中東的局勢，將有深遠的影響。</p>
<p>猶太的地下部隊已經開始軍事活動，設法吸引十萬猶太難民參加。阿刺伯人也是武裝的，假如英國對猶太國民運動派的要求讓步，那麽他們也準備採取類似的辦法。</p>
<p>猶太領袖以前是反對暴力的，但是極端份子所以得勢的原因，就是爲了一般人都相信惟有武力才可以迫使英國改變政策。由巴勒斯坦六十萬猶太人支持的大規模猶太國民運動的叛變，頗有發生的可能。</p>
<p>英國人現在正在估量猶太人和回敎徒勢力的對比。</p>
<p>猶太人以立即向英國人採取行動相威脅。英軍五師共計的八萬人，未能阻止極端份子的攻擊，雖然這種極端份子的組織，會員還不到五千人。現在猶太的主要地下部隊，又準備以受有訓練的六萬五千人參與戰鬥，其中一部份人員已經開始破壞活動。曾有一個晚上，巴勒斯坦鐵路有一百五十一處遭炸毀，另一次是同時炸毁鐵路公路橋樑八座。</p>
<p>據「世界報吿」週刋倫敎特派員的消息，英國官方相信巴勒斯坦的猶太人可以動員十萬人，其中包括當地的警察二萬四千五百人以及參與第二次世界大戰里比亞，敍利亞，希臘與義大利　戰役的復員軍人二萬五千人，武器和軍官都有辦法。</p>
<p>阿刺伯人在巴勒斯坦方面並無如此的訓練，配備或組織。但是聖地一百十萬阿刺伯人假如實行罷工猶如在一九三六年至一九三九年叛亂期間所實行的，那就可以使全國陷於痺麻狀態。阿刺伯人中擁有武器者很多，猶憶一九三八年時阿刺伯人曾實行破壞事件五千七百〇八次，現在很可能抄襲以前的辦法。</p>
<p>英國駐軍</p>
<p>阿刺伯聯盟中七個國家對於巴勒斯坦阿刺伯人的援助，大致將比他們戰前叛亂時所獲得的爲多，其中將包括金錢，武器和暗中越過邊境的非正規部隊。</p>
<p>英國駐　在中東的軍隊，大的有二十五萬人，其中駐於埃及的十萬人，駐於伊拉克的有一師，而其他的部隊則駐於塞普魯斯，希臘，里比亞和紅海區。但是軍隊和壓制的辦法並不能破壞一個由大批民衆支持的抵抗運動，這一點納粹黨在歐洲已經領敎過了</p>
<p>阿刺伯和猶太人的叛亂，並不能將英國逐出中東，但是他們可以阻撓英軍復員，塞斷石油的供應，並使英國無法在巴勒斯坦建立新根據地，以便將留駐於埃及和蘇彝士運河地帶的軍隊轉移到那裏來。</p>
<p>牽涉蘇聯</p>
<p>英國感得一且猶太人和回敎徒的衝突和叛亂正式發生，牽制了英國在中東方面的兵力，蘇聯的壓力必然會乘隙而入。蘇聯駐於巴爾幹的軍隊達百萬人，隨時可能向中東方面採取行動，來迫使土耳其和伊朗讓步。同時對於阿刺伯的叛變，蘇聯也可能予以宣傳上和經濟上的助力。</p>
<p>英國希望把巴勒斯坦劃分開來，以求政治解決。但是阿刺伯人反對劃分，而猶太人方面又堅主在巴勒斯坦成立猶太國。</p>
<p>由於妥協之絕無可能，英國已被迫要偏袒阿刺伯人或者猶太人。英國在作最後決定時，第一樁事情要考慮的，就是雙方的實力究竟誰弱誰强。</p>
<p>根據上面的敍述，這個問題的確是一個難題目。</p>
<h3>英少壯派內閣　力阻保守黨東山再起</h3>
<p>— 徐煜偉</p>
<p>最近，英首相艾德禮宣布局部改組內閣；除創設國防部，調海軍大臣亞歷山大爲首任國防大臣外，並將陸軍·海軍·空軍·民用航空·殖民各部人選，亦大事更動。國務大臣諾爾巴克（Noel—Baker）被任空軍大臣，外交次官麥克尼爾（MAcNeil）則升任國務大臣。諾·麥二人，素被認爲工黨政府中之少壯派，此次前者調任要職，後者擢升閣員，足見工黨內閣現正努力提拔新人物，產生新的力量。如此方可在國內對付擁有極大潛勢力而力圖東山再起的保守黨；在國外應付已進人原子時代的世界外交·軍事各難題。英京政治觀察家之意見，謂英內閣此次改組內閣動機之一，即爲羅致少壯派入閣，麥克尼爾之升遷，即其一例。彼諾爾巴克與麥克尼爾二人嘗數度代表英國出席國際會議，妥根據　文報紙所載之材料，略述其生平如左：</p>
<p>空軍大臣　諾爾巴克</p>
<p>諾爾巴克生於一八八九年，諾之家庭，有一特徵，即係信仰敎友會（Quaker）之敎義而爲敎友會之會友。敎友會乃基督教之一派，以提倡和平及不參加戰爭爲宗旨。此種極端非戰之教義，對目前諾氏之致力國際和平工作，影響極深。</p>
<p>諾氏不僅是品學皆優的好學生，而且又是能言善辯的辯論家兼勇冠三軍的運動家。一九一一年的英·美大學運動會中，由於諾氏的獲得一英里賽跑的冠軍，此後渠曾兩度担任英國參加奧林匹克遝動會選手隊的隊長。</p>
<p>在第一次大戰中諾氏未入伍，戰爭終了後，諾氏開始從政；在出席巴黎和會之英國代表團的國聯股中担任秘書。從該時起，諾氏之政治生涯大半係在外交方面，繼續不懈地爲國際和平的神聖工作奮鬥！一九二九年工黨執政時，諾氏被選爲下議院議負，代表工黨，並任外相漢德森的私人秘書。其後於一九三六年，諾氏担任英國出席國聯大會代表團的代表。在該時，諾氏已成爲風度翩翩而談吐高雅的少年外交家，以主角的姿態，沽躍於國際外交舞口。一九三七年的春天，諾氏嚴肅地警吿英國政府與人民，謂德國正在備戰，英國若不急起直追，後悔莫及！</p>
<p>在此次大戰的最初二年中，諾氏係在情報部任事。渠之主要任務，乃以各種語言向歐陸淪陷區中的人民廣播，報吿彼等關於戰事情况的眞相並增强彼等對於最後勝利的信心。以一個素以雄辯聞名的人物，來担任此項職務，其成績之圓滿與效果之宏偉，固事所必至與理所必然者。一九四二年一月，政府常局擢升諾氏爲戰時遝輸部次官，此乃諾氏加入內閣參家大計討論之開　．</p>
<p>第二次大戰結束後，諾氏在總選舉中大獲勝利的工黨內閣中，担任國務大臣的位置，此乃渠第一次的正式就任閣員之職。艾德禮首相與貝文外相給予渠之工作，主要的係代表英國出席各種國際曾議，尤其是聯合國機構所召集的含有經濟。社會性質之國際會議，至於那些性質複雜；關係微妙的政治外交會議，如四國外長會議·巴黎和會等，則由貝文外相親自出馬。在本年一月聯合國首决大會開會時，諾氏係英國的五位代表之一。渠又爲英國出席經濟社會理事會及善後救濟理事會之代表，並曾參加世界糧食農業會議的開幕典禮。此外，諾氏又兼任下列的職務：歐洲緊急經濟委員會的主席，歐洲糧食農業會議的主席與中歐內地運輸機構的主席。</p>
<p>國務大臣　麥克尼爾</p>
<p>麥克尼爾係蘇格蘭人。在大學肄業時，渠辦事之才幹與流利之口才，早鴛當地人士所賞識，曾一度被舉爲格勒斯哥（Glasgow）市議會議員；麥氏又曾以帝國議會代衣團代表的資格，遠游南非。少年時的旅行美非兩洲，增加見　，裨益不少。學校卒業後，麥氏即從事新聞事業，曾在「蘇格　每日快報」工作，所寫文章，議論精闢，爲一成功的新聞記者。</p>
<p>一九一年，麥氏當選爲下議院議員。其後，常諾氏任戰時運輸部次官時，麥氏亦走進戰時運論部，爲諾氏之私人秘書；兩人私交　爲融治，對國事亦　有相同境見，此次工黨內閣局部改組後，麥氏即繼諾氏爲國務大臣，「蕭規曹隨」，可知彼兩人關係之密切矣。</p>
<p>去夏工黨執政後，麥氏被任爲外交次官，輔佐貝文外相，極得後者之信任，視之爲左右臂；十一月中，麥氏奉命前往希京雅典，調査該處複雜之局勢，回國後，提供不少合理之意見，益爲當局所器重，衆皆以外相之繼承者視之。此次擢升爲國務大臣，即爲日後出任外相作一準備步驟。</p>
<p>時事評述</p>
<h3>共和黨獲勝後　美國外交策不變更</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>這一星期來的世界大事，煨惹人注意的，有下述三項：（一）表國　衆兩院改選，在野十四年的共和黨，突然獲得了勝利，不僅將控制美國第四十屆的國會，而且一九四八年總統競選，也有了極大的希望。（二）中國政局的急轉有下，蔣主席突然頒發停止衝突的命令，幾乎成爲各國報紙的「大新聞」，無不用大字作標題，並登花顯著的地方。（三）聯合國大會託管委員會，討論託管問題，因爲美蘇竟見的紛歧，也沒有討論出一個結果。而美國則堅持管理日本以前在太平洋上的代管島嶼，尤爲世人所注意。</p>
<p>美普選後　外交不變</p>
<p>美國國會本於月五日舉行改選，開票結果，在野十四年的共和黨，竟能壓倒民主黨而獲得勝利，雖在我們意料之中，但其意義却非常重大，爲任何一國所不能忽視的。杜魯門總統離開任期屆滿之時，尙有整整的兩年，而至第四十屆國會開幕之後，參衆兩院都在共和黨控制之下了，所以杜魯門總統不論在內政或外交上所有舉動，必然要遭到國會的牽制。尤其在內政方面。共和黨不滿意杜魯門的內政方針，由來已久，一俟第四十屆國會開幕，必然的要削弱杜魯門政府以前所行　的戰時權力．誠如前總統胡佛稱：「最近數年以來，整個的世界，包括美國在內，一直在計劃經濟的全能之路上向左走；但是現在的美國，經　次普選之後，將爲放棄此一路綫之第一國矣。」</p>
<p>但是在外交方面，共和黨的獲勝，並無重大影響。因爲貝爾納斯國務卿所採取的外交政策：受共和黨外交發言人范登堡的影響甚大，美國不論出席何種國際會議，都有范登堡在內，美國出席聯合國機構的首席代表奧斯汀，也是共和黨中的重要人物。據范登堡於八日在成功湖畔演說稱：「不論華府之政治體系如何？美國將繼續以全力支持聯合國。美國政府誓必與世界各國忠誠合作，俾萬聯合國機構以獲致和平與正義。』</p>
<p>託管問題　尚難解決</p>
<p>聯合國大會從本月四日起，即開始討論託管問題。但是聯合國憲章對於託管制，並未有明確切實的規定，因此所謂「直接關係國家」，究作何種解釋，各國代表的見解，也就各不相同了。而美國對於太平洋以前由日太代管的島嶼，又向安全理事會提出一個管託協定的草案，雖主張將所有島嶼移　聯合國託管，但美國仍保留其管理權。美國顯欲在各該島嶼，設立軍事基地，當要引　各國對於美國的疑懼，因此美國所提出的草案，能否爲託管委　會通過，也就很難斷音了。蘇聯勢必表示異議，自不待言，　　　英國澳洲及紐西蘭，也不會表示贊成的。</p>
<p>聯合國大會下星期內，將繼續討論這個託管問題，又恐不免要引起幾塲舌戰了。</p>
<p>法國普選　左派得勢</p>
<p>法國於本月十日舉行普選，選舉第四共和國民大會議員，據開票的結果，共產黨竟佔優勢，獲得二，八　〇·〇九四票，佔投票總數百分之二十九。其决爲人民共和黨，獲得二·二七〇·〇〇〇票。假如說美國共和黨的獲勝，是美國政治向右轉的象徵；則法國共和黨的獲勝，當可謂法國政治左傾的開始。所以美法兩國普選的結果，在目前的國際上正是一個絕好的對照。今後的世界，究將走那一條道路呢？現今已在十字路口了。而且戰後不景氣的陰影，也也已開始投射到世界各國了。（十一月十二日）。</p>

<h3>駐聯合國　波蘭代表　蘭琪博士　……保持獨立態度……　時常反對蘇聯</h3>
<p>— 南譯自「饞馳驪吿」週刊</p>
<p>波蘭駐美大使兼聯合國代表蘭琪</p>
<p>波蘭駐聯合國代表闌琪是一個相當受人注意的人物。他是一個社會“主義者，代表的是一個共產黨領導的政府，而以前又是一個美國公民，現在又爲一個蘇聯勢力範圍內的國家脫話。</p>
<p>蘭琪在聯合國許多代表中，一向是興高采烈的一個，但是從八月十七日起輪値了安全理事會的主席之後，態度時常顯得嚴肅和疲勞起來，他的決議，有時遭到西方國家代表猛烈的抨擊，另有些時候又招致蘇　代表的不歡。</p>
<p>觀察家認爲蘭琪曾經接到華沙政府嚴格的命令，不得在重要問題上反對蘇聯。但是他在討論世界間題時往往和葛羅米柯採取頗爲不同的觀點和立塲，雖然在重要問題上最後還是支持蘇聯的。</p>
<p>他和葛羅米柯的態度並不完全一致。例如蘭琪不顧蘇聯的反對，贊成愛爾蘭加入聯合國。在安理會討論伊期問題時。他對於蘇聯所提將此項問題自議程中取消的建議，不表贊同，而當葛羅米格憤然退出安理會會塲時，他依然坐在他的席位上。</p>
<p>主張造成諒解　保持友好態度</p>
<p>這位富有學者風度的外交家主張在大國之間造成諒解，無論對最接近波蘭的鄰邦蘇聯或者對西方諸國，都希望保持友好的態度。</p>
<p>琪和葛羅米柯　見上偶然的不相一致，引起了種種言，傳說華沙將迫他辭職了，但是他否認這種傳說。目下，蘭琪是波蘭駐聯合國機構的代表同時又駐美大使，但是在最近將來他很可能放棄大使的職位，而集中力量於聯合國的工作　蘭琪已往的經歷是相當奇特的。他自從一九三四年後幾乎一直住在美國，並且在七個美國大學中讀過擔任過敎職。最後在一九四三年他獲得了美國公民籍。兩年後。爲了他在政治上主張波蘇友善，被邀擔任駐美大使。他回到過華沙，放棄了美國公民籍，重新變了波蘭公民。但是他原籍愛爾闌的妻子和他七歲的兒子至今仍舊是美國公民，蘭琪本人依然是芝加哥大學的敎授，現在不過在請似中而已。</p>
<p>一個經濟學家　發生政治與趣</p>
<p>蘭琪是一個經濟學家，戰時對於政治發生興趣，發表了許多有關蘇聯和倫敦波蘭流亡政府衝突的文章和演說。他認爲流亡政府　反動份子所控制，力促自由份子和它脫離，去參加莫斯科支持的波蘭愛國者聯盟。這個主張，在一九四五年舉行耶爾達會議時爲三强所接受。</p>
<p>同時由於波蘭人的邀請，他曾往蘇聯作六星期的旅行。一九四四年五月，史達林曾親予接見，談了一百四十分鐘。其後，蘭琪說他相信史達林希望有一個堅強的波蘭，「毫無强制新波　順從蘇聯而決定共政治，經濟或社會形式」</p>
<p>不拘形式談話　大受記者歡迎</p>
<p>這個波蘭外交家身長五尺三寸，重一百七十六磅，新聞記者都很歡　他，因爲他不拘形式，很願意和記者隨便談活，往往能從他那裏得到有關蘇聯行動極好的解釋。</p>
<p>蘭琪最大的希望，就是想把蘇聯和西方國家之間的間隙彌補起來。波蘭介於東西之間，這種政策當然是對她最有利的　蘭琪原來是美國公民，又是蘇聯經濟學家，對於這樁工作，當然是極適宜的。可是對於一個小國的外交家，這樁工作實在是不能再難的了。現在他擔任安理會主席一個月的期限已滿，或許他倒可以感覺到輕鬆一點吧。</p>

<h3>關良畫贊</h3>
<p>— 朱應鵬</p>
<p>關良君在抗戰初起，即轉入大後方，擔任國立藝專教席，頃已隨校東歸。在這八年之中，他一貫地埋頭作畫，努力不懈。他的工夫，已由純粹的西洋作風，進步到創作民族的新藝術的境地。覽其成績，令人有「壁壘一新，旌旗變色」之感。我深深地贊歎，他在八年中的光陰，不是虛度的。</p>
<p>二十餘年前，關君初從日本歸國，曾與陳抱一許教谷兩君合作舉行畫展。初次帶來了西洋印象主義的作風，使新興的藝術運動，受到了強烈的刺激。由於他們製作態度的忠實和根底的堅固，學者一致推崇，認爲真正的工夫，決非標竊皮毛，塗飾而貌，欺世盜名之流，所可同日而語的。關君等最初在藝術上的貢獻，除藝術同人之外，絕未受其他方面的注意。忠實的藝人，衹有埋頭研究的精神，絕無妄尊自大的習氣。因之，爲學愈深至，身世愈寂寞。不合理的現象，隨時隨處，莫不皆然，尤其是中國的社會，最爲難說。</p>
<p>新文藝上民族主義的興起，曾激起一度波瀾，雖不是狂潮巨浪，但迄目前，在有形無形之中，漸已被認爲第一義諦。此在最初，亦不過少數同人，在互相探討之餘，得到中心的認識，所見既趨於一致，就不免提出來，作爲一種呼聲。我們需要民族主義的文藝，原不是頑固的復古，而是基於民族意識和民族歷史風土人情的自然存在，使之覺醒，同時吸收西洋文化，作爲新血素，用以恢復民族的青春生命。當時亦深感五四運動以後，學術界人土和一般青年，雖了解衰舊的中國文化，不足以應時代的潮流，而在思想解放之中，不免反客爲主，忘却民族的立塲。這弱點被野心國家利用，浸至在政治上有「謂他人父」的危機。在眾說紛紜期間，同人們不免受到多少的襲擊，這原是意中之事。惟各人均有相當的自信力，一切在所不計，特別是少數從事美術的同人，索性守着沉默，繼續不斷的研究。關良君即是其中之一。</p>
<p>他近來的製作，於西畫之外，兼進而作新的國畫。</p>
<p>他的國畫，專以水墨，抒寫各種人物的印象，尤以各地方戲劇爲多，即可稱之爲「水墨畫」。原來西洋的印象畫派，是受東方繪畫的影響而興起的。其中自有一貫的線索。而關君的畫，不但純取各地風土，而水墨的神明變化，既含蓄，又脫化，韻味深長，尤臻於國畫的上乘。所寫人物，只是寥寥數筆，而風趣神情，躍然紙上。想見作者感興的敏銳，性靈的活潑。用筆有時飄若游絲，有時矯若翔龍，空靈沈着，兼而有之。着色不多，愈簡而愈富刺激性。往往用單純的朱黃青翠和淡紅諸色，配以水墨，殊覺冷艷逼人。每幅所含情調，雖兼具西洋後期印象派之勝，却又不同於塞尙，果根和馬梯斯的面貌。這種水墨人物，如以普通國畫眼光去鑒賞界限的狹窄，恐尙不止於此。本來藝術的創作，必爲前人所未有，普通人自然看不慣，便不肯去甞味。但真實工夫，無不幾經磨練，不是一朝一夕之事。此中甘苦，更非故作怪誕，沽名釣譽者所得而假託。羅兩峰好作鬼趣圖，諷刺鑒家，未免有傷忠厚，然對於作者方面，亦未始不是一種釙砭。</p>
<p>他的西畫，多爲風景寫生，近年足跡所至，遊於川豫陝甘　貴諸省，不辭艱險，歷寫各地古蹟名勝。大自然的啓發和歷史的感應，開拓了他的藝術領域。雖因油畫材料缺乏，衹作水彩。而取景佈局，專寫巨流大河，崇山竣嶺，危峰飛瀑，純乎是國畫山水的風格。畫幅雖小，却有崇髙偉大之觀。筆觸縱橫秀拔，宛然晋唐名人畫法，所作　樹，尤爲超妙。這與人物畫的用筆，又大異其趣。色調精微凝鍊，氣象渾淪，骨貌俱清。如以國畫眼光去體察，即無一幅不是最髙妙的山水畫。其得心應手之處，直可奪吳墨井之席。在西洋風景畫中，固未有此種情韻也。這樣，方纔可稱爲有民族精神的水彩畫，關君從未作國畫山水，惟其西畫工夫之深，所以對於國畫山水理法的精緻，能不期而會，一以貫之，有左右逢源之樂。如日本的所謂折衷派，便不免於矯揉造作，生吞活剝，絕對不能相提並論的。關君在川時，有幾位國畫家，見到他所寫風景，章法奇闢，動目駭心，不覺請求借摹一本，留作畫稿。國畫家情形如此，反證關君之作，所包含的中國意味，十分濃重。</p>
<p>與關君一別數年，相見之後，既羨其工夫的精進，又追念在新藝術運動共經的歷程，真是俯仰前後，感懷不盡。關君最近將舉行個展，特誌數語，凡在真鑑，諒不致認爲偏一之見。</p>

<h3>文藝創作的心理描寫</h3>
<p>— 沈先源</p>
<p>一篇成功的文藝作品，作者必需要經過觀察經驗，與體驗的三種過程，所以在形象的表現以外，更不能缺少心理的描寫，一個文藝作家，當他在開始進行創作的時候，對於人的心理生活，也應該像對於人的行動的描寫一樣，不應漠然忽視，至少應該以之作爲現實描寫的一種補助手法，因爲所謂「人」，不但動物性的生活着，而且他也是社會的存在，當他生存於某種特定的社會裏的時候，他不但需要物質的滿足，而且也有其各自的慾求，各自的情感和思想，以及各自的心理反應的。暫居以人的生活，都有他的內外兩面，而這內外兩面，又是統一於人的全人格之中，而被表現於外的。</p>
<p>所以，有一種作家，當他選取題材的時候，專門喜歡發掘個人的奇特的心境，和心理上的反當現象，如癲狂，白癡，性愛狂等等的對於人類的原始本能和感情，作深度的發掘；而把人的生活的隱秘的一面，變態的一面，毫無諱飾的予以深刻的解剖，這些作家的作品，在通常的情境下，都是表現人類奇特的心理現象，這種對於創作方法的特殊嗜好，也只好有供和這有同樣嗜好的人作爲賞鑑與消遣的資料。　　在中國，過去也曾經有人提倡過什麼文學上的心理主義，並且要以此作爲號召，形成一種風尙。其實這是很要不得的。對於人的正當的認識，固然不僅單只要知道他的外表就可以，而還要更進一步的去知道他的內心；但如果不理解事態，則對於人也僅僅只能够得到外面的理解。人是存在於社會中的，對於創作，也像對於一切人類所作的事情一樣，不能忽視個性的重要，但個性總是社會的個性，牠的成長和發生都是有牠的社會的根源的，如果一個作家，單只注意於他作品中的人物的心理的發掘，而輕視他的外在的環境，或者更忽視他的透過行動而表露於外的心理現象的生理根據，沒有注意這二者的有機的複雜的關聯，和人物心理的社會存在的理由，那就只有使作品的內容觀念化，而陷於抽象的心理主義的傾向；同時，作品中人物的心理活動，也只是成爲架空的，出於作者主觀的虛構而已。</p>
<p>在新的創作方法中，正和行動描寫之被重視一樣，也不忽視人的心理描寫的重要。但牠已經超載了個人中心的觀點，而進一步的注意到羣眾的心理的表現。當他們作人物的心理描寫的時候，不但沒有忘記人的社會的存在，在大部分的塲合，人的心理反應，總是透過行動而表現出來的；他們更注意人的心理構成的過程，人的心理現象，不是固定的，而是因着時間的變化，情境的變化，時常現出多樣性來的。</p>
<p>但是，在表現人類心理的構成過程中，還有應該注意的地方，那就是必須伴之以行動的展開，把人的心理活動，看作是從屬於其行動的展開而來的。就是從主人公的一些行爲和動作裏來暗示給讀者以他的心理的真實。</p>
<p>然而，有的作家，在他作品中從事人物的心理描寫的時候，多半由他的作品中的主人公，作冗長的心理獨白，或者是用對話式的哲學的論辯，可是像這類的創作方法，是已成爲過去的東西了。文藝作品是最忌容納着關於哲學的思辨的，而心理的獨白，太冗長了，也容易使人讀了發生厭倦，所以我以爲像這一類的創作方法，是應該也要注意的。</p>

<p>在揚州要吃點心，總該不會忘却富春茶社的。這富春在揚州人看來，不但點心好，茶好，桌子也清潔。茶是用龍井·珠蘭·魁針三種茶葉攙合來泡的，龍井取其色，珠蘭取其香，魁針取其味。如是一杯茶能色香味俱全，這不够人讚美嗎？至於桌子，一般茶社裏的都是油膩不堪，可是這在富春，却可使茶客們放心。潔白的衣袖即使久久壓在桌上，也不會就被玷污了。因爲那裏對於每張桌子，每天都要刮垢磨光的。</p>
<p>這富春裏面有一些房屋，在過去都有一定的名稱，雖沒用什麼匾額之類標記明白，却爲一般人所公認，如鄉賢祠會的地方。房屋比較的矮，光綫也就比較的差，別人多不願進去，他們也不希望別人進去，因爲那會擾亂了敲詩下棋風雅的氛圍。大成殿是因爲有一位姓江的固定在那裏品茶。在過去，他的父親品學兼優，人們都稱做聖人。聖人的兒子，無疑的是小聖人。小聖人當坐的地方，就被稱做大成殿。爲什麼不稱做聖公府，似乎更爲風趣而確切，這就不知其所以了。至於不了了齋，那又因爲過去曾有幾位投閑置散的人們專在那裏品茶。他們既無什麼社會上的地位，生活方面也不怎樣寬裕，對於一切事，都抱着「以不了了之」的態度，於是這地方就變成不了了齋。此外有所謂教育局，那是教育界人士集中的地點，土地廟，那是面積太小，直和一座土地廟相彷彿，凡此等等，似乎都沒有上述三處的定名饒有意趣。</p>
<p>可是這三處地方，近年以來都顯然的異樣了。鄉賢祠裏的鄉賢們，逐漸的新陳代謝，並且也逐漸的稀少下去。那裏的茶客，似乎換了一批厭囂避煩的人們，衹想藉這比較黑暗的一些的地方，遺忘了眼前熙來攘往的現實，早沒有往昔的風雅了，至於大成殿和不了了齋，時移世變以後，都已諸色人等俱全。小聖人既餬口四方，不能常到大成殿，而投閑置散的一些茶客，墜溷飄茵，也早經升沉迴異，不能復行聚首於不了了齋。兼以茶社主人陳步雲最近又不再負責，已將茶社的營業交給原來的茶役們合辦，因此，便更少了一位滿臉春風，殷勤招待的人物。這使得資格比較老些的茶客看去，總不免有滄桑之感。</p>
<p>不過，富春茶社，原來也衹是一所花局，變成茶社，僅是民國初年的事。在未變成茶社以前，不過一些老前輩們借在那裏坐坐。所有茶具等等，都是他們自己備辦的。他們每天在花叢中品茗，敲詩，着棋，繪畫。需要什麼點心，總從別處購買來。據說有時還在那裏飛觴醉月。那時他們曾定名爲借團，後來該是因爲人數漸漸的多了，應付不便，這才由花局的小主人，也就是前面提起的陳步雲正式的開起茶社來。而那些老前輩，一時便都退居到鄉賢祠的裏面去了。他們因爲和這地方關係太深，有些方面就會受到優待。譬如說，清早去泡了一壺茶，可以留下一半茶葉，到午後再來泡，衹算一壺茶錢，這就不是別人所能享受的權利。到了現在，老成彫謝，這種情形再也沒有了。所以我們如再從過去的借團，說到現在的富春茶社，所謂滄桑之感，將會格外的增加其濃度哩。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　91</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這「篤篤」兩下響過，僅僅衹有半秒鐘時間，陡然聽得一種極大喇叭一樣刺耳的聲音呌着，「啊呃…！」以下嘰哩咕嚕，說的日語，好像在宣佈什麼。</p>
<p>「糟，小姨！」虎弟悄聲說：「大概鬼子在喚那隻獒吧？」</p>
<p>我也來不及回答虎弟的話，只命令似的說，「快到大卡車裏找一隻大虎鉗，把那汽油桶底層的一排，每隻咬開一個口……快！」</p>
<p>這時已經快九點了。虎弟在那一排汽車卡車裏，　　找去，卒然從一部卡車裏，找到一隻一尺多長的老虎鉗子，跑到堆成山的汽油桶前，把那底層一排，逐個用鉗子把桶邊的捲邊咬住，一撬一擰，就成一隻小口。虎弟力氣頗大，手動伶俐，幹這工作，倒像一個道地內行，並且毫無聲響。這油桶大概共是五排，每排約莫四十多隻大號圓形油桶；每層隔花曡壘上去，約八九層，共計近二千桶。</p>
<p>虎弟在撬油桶的時候，我正着手把油池的加油唧筒管子扯直，順在地上，管頭正對汽油桶。這裏共有二十四座氣壓唧筒，一座一座，我都替牠把上下兩個活門放開，此外的工作就是轉動搖手，那油就像自來水開了龍頭似的，大股流出。虎弟撬完了幾十只汽油桶的時候，我這裏還只搖到第三隻，然而這十多丈方圓的水泥地面上，已灌滿了汽油，其餘的都向油桶底下，像湖水似的侵漫過去。虎弟踏着汽油過來，見我正轉着搖手，也沒等我吩咐，就跑到南頭最後一座唧筒那邊，動手搖動起來。</p>
<p>我們搖動唧筒不多一會，那摘聲器的播音已經停止。幸而這些油管都順地面平放着，油從管內流出，僅有細微的流水聲響，十碼之外，不見得可以聽到，所以我們很可安心工作。</p>
<p>經過約莫二十幾分鐘光景，我們才唧完了七八座油池，放出的汽油，引動大火，已是綽有餘裕，我猛然想到，引火的工作，也得相當長的時間安排，便跑到虎弟身邊，悄聲告訴他繼續工作，我要安排引火的東西。虎弟聽了，嗤的一笑說，「幹嗎要費那們大事，只要臨走，跑到相當距離放上一兩槍不就行了？」我告訴他，不能這麼辦。要是一響槍聲，鬼子就知道我們的行動方向。</p>
<p>當然，我們並不是不能像做電影一般，把油放完，搶上一部汽車，臨行，砰砰幾槍，把汽油引燃，然後開車往禁衛區外直衝出來。那是多麼簡單，乾脆而痛快。殊不知電影的目標，是要教觀客動目，那編劇導演，既無親身經驗，又無諜深工作知識，也顧不到情節的合理與否，就那麼一想情願的做了。</p>

<p>稽康義生論中說：</p>
<p>「措身失理，亡之於微。積微成損，積損成衰。從衰得白，從白得老。從老得終，悶若無端。仰觀俯察，莫不皆然。」</p>
<p>防微與杜漸，在人們的日常生活行爲中，的確是一個重大的試鍊，也是很困難的一個課題，原因就在於「微」而非巨，「漸」而非驟。稽先生絕非誇張，危言聳聽，不僅人們生理上如此，推而至於社會一切又何嘗不如此？</p>
<p>排隊候車賣票，這似乎是一件小事，因爲是細節，人們往往便忽視了它，因之許多公共塲所的秩序，也就很難以維持；另一面，假使人人都尊重先來後到按着次序魚貫上下車或入塲，不僅避免了許多無謂的意外，且保持了公共的秩序，使人人的守法精神格外堅實，它於自然中所造成的影響力量我們實在是無法估計的。</p>
<p>排除候車不過是其例之一而已。今日之身受國法制裁的這批漢奸們，他們何嘗不是絕頂聰明之人，衹緣當初一念之差，以後便逐漸沉淪而不能自拔，才有今日的下塲。</p>
<p>新聞參考資料</p>
<h3>兩個例子</h3>
<p>— 麥葉</p>
<p>讀十月卅日報上中央社兩條電訊，愈想愈糊塗。電文上所說的事我並非不懂，但我只能懂個「大概」和「差不多」！</p>
<p>其一是廿九日廣州該社電，說粵漢綫輕便鐵路汽車通車，「每一汽車之載重量可增至一百九十噸，時速廿九公里，汽油每一加侖可行走五哩」事情記述很清楚；不很清楚的在乎「單位」和「單位」之不統一。</p>
<p>「噸」，請問是什麼「噸」？假如這電報是由「法國新聞社」發出，我們還可推斷爲「公噸」即一千公斤。假如是「路透社」電，那想必是「英國噸」（亦名「大噸」即Iongton或grosston），合二千二百四十磅。又假如是「美關社」電，那當然是「美國噸」（亦名「小噸」即Shortton或netton）也無疑矣。既然說是車，當然不是船的「噸」了，但說貨物載搭量時也有人用「容積噸」（Measurernent　ton，合一百立方英呎）的。而我看中央社的「噸」，衹能曉得「差不多」而已！</p>
<p>「時速廿九公里」而汽油消耗率是每加侖「五哩」。難道不可以把「五哩」換算成「八公里」使人更容易懂一些麼？單位統一了，讀者就很容易曉得那汽車不過約用三加侖半省油就可以走一個鐘頭的路程了。</p>
<p>第二條電報是瀋陽電，說東北大豆過剩，當地生產管理局在瀋　設以大豆製造羊毛，「聞大豆製成羊毛之彈性及光澤均與羊毛無異」。</p>
<p>請問：「大豆製成羊毛」這樣說法有語病嗎？</p>
<p>假如說沒有，那末，我們可否援例的說：「以木材製成蠶絲」，「以紙製成木棉」，「以煤炭製成「玻璃」（Nylon）」……麼？</p>
<p>勉强說「可以」吧，到底費解得很。因爲木材木漿製造出來的不過是類似天然絲的「人造絲」（Crayon），紙漿製造出來的不過是類似棉花的「長纖維」（Staple　fibre），按，二次大戰前德日兩國均有大量製造，以救棉花來源不足，日人簡稱之曰Su-fu，似未聞有「人造棉」一詞者。）而「尼　」，亦不過是碳的一種有機化學合成纖維，既不是天然絲，更非「玻璃」！與此類似的「人造纖維」，種類多得很呢！</p>
<p>牛乳中的「乳酪素」（Casein）也可以抽成纖維以供紡織，大豆亦如是。由大豆而獲得的纖維，當然亦歸入「人造纖維」之一種，但因爲紡織時所用的不像「人造絲」的纖維有那末長，所以它又稱爲「人造短纖維」。天然羊毛在紡紗中較天然絲纖維和天然棉纖維都短，所以「人造短纖維」也未嘗不可馬虎一點呌做「人造羊毛」，不過，「人造」二字少不得！</p>
<p>一男一女婚後獲個娃，「　啥希奇」。假如有一天，科學家真能用一升米兩斗麥「製造」出一個小囡囡，我相信，無論怎麼像，也得戴個「人造」（而非人養）帽子。不然，成啥話？</p>
<p>我不想吹毛求疵。我希望大的通訊社和報社的新聞從業員能够「分工」和「專門化」。外國不是有「科學記者」，「科學編輯」嗎？其次，我希望報上一切度量衡單位統一，不要里·公里·市里·海里·英里……同時活躍於版面！你以爲前進十英哩，而又倒退十五公里的軍隊是進了還是退了呢？</p>
<h3>英雄美人</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>·東北軍中佳話·</p>
<p>最近從一位東北友人的信中，得悉許多軍人羅曼史的佳話。</p>
<p>自從兩支轉戰印緬的新軍（新一軍及新六軍）開到東北後，到處受着各界人士的歡迎，還有那接踵而至的國軍也同樣被熱烈的歡迎，因爲他們打了八年仗，流了許多血，當然，今天東北的人民對於這些國軍，尤其是曾經轉戰於異國疆塲的戰士們，會以格外崇敬的眼光，看他們。</p>
<p>最顯著的是許多婦女都打破了傳統的「瞧不起丘八」的心理，相反的，漂亮的小姐年青的女郎，以及日本的女人，都統統很親熱的來接近武士們。</p>
<p>今日，東北武士們大多都很整潔美觀，威武異常，穿着整潔美觀的皮大衣，呢軍服，皮馬靴。普通在學校裏念書的女孩子，尤其是二十歲左右的女郎，他們特別羨慕年青的軍官。她們覺得這些年青的軍官是少年英俊的馬上英雄。因此，很多在戰時娶不起太太的軍官，如今都有了一個漂亮的妻子。在瀋陽·長春·錦州三地，差不多間日有人舉行婚禮，而參與婚禮者皆爲軍人。</p>
<p>士兵們比官長要窮一點，同時也不會跳舞，所以，他們的目標多指向日本女人。他們只要化很少的錢，就可以從那些咖啡館日本女招待身上找到臨時的慰藉。</p>
<p>在關內，軍人不但受不到別人的歡迎，同時，一般人多帶着歧視的眼光看他們，女人是更不用說，最看不起丘八的典型人物，舞塲是禁止軍人跳舞的；但在關外，恰恰相反，未免令人羨慕。我們以爲，在抗戰勝利後的今日，軍中多佳話，原不足爲奇，我們不能說「軍人不可談戀愛」。不過，只要在自由的氣氛中，稍加約束，不太洋貨即可。我們希望武士們以正常的態度來處理羅曼史一類的事情，老百姓也以正常而自然的態度來盾軍人。</p>
<p>智力測驗</p>
<h3>時間的記憶</h3>
<p>— 予蜂</p>
<p>你感到上辦公室或是到學校時常會遲到嗎？也許你沒有一隻很準確的鐘或錶，也是一個很重要的原因；但另一方面你對時間的記憶力太弱，卻更是使你遲到的主要原因。</p>
<p>也許你會不信，現在你可以自己測驗一下。這測驗是最簡單也是最準確的：</p>
<p>你對一隻錶看一下，把所看到的時間最詳細的寫下來（秒數自然也要寫）然後你把這錶藏起或移開，你開始默默地記憶（默測）着從看錶後所過去的時間，（以秒爲單位）。幾分鐘後，你把所記憶的秒數迅速的寫下，再迅速地看錶。看時間的過去是否與所記憶過去的時間差不多。假使還接近，就知道你是一個不大會遲到的人；假使記憶的秒數超出實際所過去的時間很多，那你一定是個早到者，反之，你就容易遲到的了。</p>
<p>這個測驗，心理學專家曾經對他的許多學生不時地試驗。往往錶是過了一百十秒時，有許多人衹記錄才過六十多秒，也有人記錄已過二百秒，相差三倍餘。而記錄六十多秒的學生經考察出確是常常遲到的。</p>
<h3>天變</h3>
<p>— 厲生</p>
<p>不知怎的，現在已是農歷的十月中旬了，却還是熱得很，有幾天中午幾可穿單衫，好像初夏的氣候。</p>
<p>因爲天時熱的關係，鄉下田裏種的蠶豆，已經枝葉很茂了，如果再這樣熱，可有開花的可能。前幾天報載常州某鄉桃樹入秋開花，不外也是氣候失常所致。</p>
<p>當冷不冷，疫病便更多了，這幾天白喉症很多。昨天隣家一老者，白天還在做小工，今早忽然氣絕，據說是「閉口痧」；總而言之，今冬如果下雪的話，鄉村的蔬菜和麥苗，一定大受損害，但如果今冬不下雪，那麼來年的疫癘更將不堪，不知老天爲什麼要作弄？</p>

<p>心理分析家的故事</p>
<h3>無辜的殺人犯</h3>
<p>— 許桂庭</p>
<p>在美國最近出版第一本關於心理分析故事，巴爾金（Nigel　Balchin）所著的「無辜的殺人犯。」它叙述一個駭人聽聞的故事，叙述一位心理分析家企圖替一個患神經病的英國復員軍人解決「人生之謎」，來醫治他的病症，并且希望在他犯殺人罪之前把他的神經病醫好。不幸得很，結局竟是一齣無可挽救的悲劇：那個病人用槍擊傷了妻子，險些兒把心理分析家也毆傷了，結果弄得滿城風雨，全倫敦的警察大傷其腦筋，最後他透露了他過去的一段不可告人的遭遇，才用手槍結束了他自己的性命。全書很長，「雜誌文摘」把它縮成十數頁的故事，而譯者爲了便利讀者起見，再把它節譯出來，這　　聽聞的心理犯罪故事是這樣展開：</p>
<p>心理分析家，米恩，靜靜地坐在椅子上，注視着地氈。人是怪疲倦的，實在餓得難受。老是這樣多人去請教他。</p>
<p>他的妻，柏莉，對他說：「要你幫忙的人實在太多了。哦，有一位魯遜夫人曾經打過電話來約你談談。我告訴她可以在星期四下午來這裏。可以嗎？」</p>
<p>米恩回答：「唔，當然可以。」</p>
<p>隔了幾天，魯遜夫人果然如約而來。而面龐很瘦削，皮膚黑色，年紀大約二十五歲左右，個子非常之小。</p>
<p>她進來的時候，行動頗爲慌張，但是態度還是相當嚴肅。米恩到有一點不自在，勉强向她親切地笑一笑。她了微笑一下，和米恩拉拉手。</p>
<p>米恩於是問道：「你有什麼困難嗎？」她答：「我沒有什麼困難。有毛病的還是我的丈夫，阿當。他總是想謀殺我。」</p>
<p>「唔，」米恩說：「那麼，他應該看看醫生了。」</p>
<p>魯孫夫人蹙一蹙眉頭，說：「他就是這樣討厭。他不喜歡看醫生的。在戰爭的時候，他看了許多醫生，所以他見到醫生，就覺到討厭。」</p>
<p>米恩點點頭，說：「那麼，你告訴我事情到底怎樣發生的！」</p>
<p>「事情是這樣：我是一個美國人。我是來英國游歷的。在倫敦，我和阿當相遇，後來在一九四零年初和他結婚。」</p>
<p>「他現在多大年紀？」</p>
<p>「他是二十八歲了。他是皇家空軍的戰鬥機駕駛員。戰績是很卓越的。」</p>
<p>「你倆的婚姻生活美滿嗎？」</p>
<p>「的確，很美滿的。他起初很起勁地渡着空中戰鬥的生活，可是後來厭倦了。在亞洲戰塲上找一件地面服務的工作做。後來，我聽見他失踪了。他在仰光上空作戰，飛機着火，連人帶機跌下去了。差不多一年之後，他居然生還。據他說，他當時用降落傘跳出飛機來，墮在一條樹上。爬下後遇到一班土人。他們款待他很好，不料他們把他出賣於日本鬼子。日本鬼子恐怕他會逃走，所以把他一條腿弄斷了，可是他還能够摸着一個機會用一條木頭結束了一個日本鬼子，然後逃回這裏來。」</p>

<h3>Comprehensive Talks Still Yield No Results, U.S. Ambassador Concerned About Peace Prospects, Zhou Enlai Expresses Stance to National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] This morning, the members of the Democratic League convened an internal meeting at the Lan family residence until 11:00 AM, then went to the Bank of Communications to hold a meeting with the Youth Party and social elites. Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai, Huang Biwu, Li Weihan, and Deng Yingchao also attended at 11:30 AM to discuss the list of National Assembly members, which concluded at 2:00 PM. Zhou Enlai then visited the U.S. Ambassador, meeting until 4:00 PM. At the same time, an informal comprehensive meeting was held at Sun Ke's residence. Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu also attended. The representatives present included Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Mo Dehui, Hu Lin, Miao Jiaming, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, as well as the convener Sun Ke and Political Consultative Conference Secretary-General Lei Zhen, to discuss the list of National Assembly members and the draft constitution. Zhou Enlai stated at the time that both topics were currently impossible to discuss. Huang Yanpei advocated redrafting the constitution, but due to time constraints, it seemed unlikely. This informal comprehensive meeting lasted for two and a half hours. Due to the lack of concrete results, it is said that it will continue on the 13th, with the draft constitution remaining the focus of discussion.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Social elite representative Hu Lin visited the U.S. Ambassador at 10:00 AM this morning, departing after a half-hour conversation. The Ambassador received Zhou Enlai for a lengthy discussion in the afternoon and visited Special Envoy Marshall at 5:00 PM to convey Hu's opinions. Both the U.S. Ambassador and Special Envoy Marshall are very concerned about the prospects for peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Chairman Chiang left his official residence for Sun Ke's residence at 5:00 PM on the 12th. At that time, Sun was presiding over the comprehensive meeting. The Chairman did not enter the venue, staying for ten minutes before leaving. He then drove via Zhongshan North Road to Xiaguan Railway Station and returned after a walk along the riverbank.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Sun Ke and Lei Zhen jointly paid a visit to the Chairman at approximately 8:00 PM on the 12th to report on the day's meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] During discussions with Sun on the 12th, Zhou Enlai left early at 6:00 PM to visit Special Envoy Marshall, returning to the Meiyuan New Village after about two hours. Tonight, according to the spokesman for the Communist Party delegation, Zhou's remarks today clarified the Communist Party's position, the main points being: (1) The National Assembly should be halted immediately. If it cannot be halted, it will cause a complete rupture. The responsibility for this rupture should be borne by the government. (2) If the National Assembly is convened, it must be in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>Various Parties Will Nominate Candidates, Democratic League Issues Statement</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Social elite representatives continued to work for peace on the 12th, hoping that the Youth Party and the Democratic League would submit lists of National Assembly representatives so that the National Assembly could be convened in an atmosphere of peace and unity. It is said that Li Huang will discuss the nomination of candidates in Shanghai. The Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party under the leadership of Zhang Junmai may submit lists in the short term. The Democratic League insists that everything must be done in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. If all the necessary procedures can be completed, it will naturally participate in the National Assembly. Despite various contacts today, there were still no results.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Social Democratic Party leader Zhang Junmai, along with Jiang Yuntian and Sun Baoyi, arrived in Shanghai by night train from Nanjing on the 12th. That evening, Zhang convened a meeting of party members at the party's office on Yu Guo Road. Zhang first reported to those present on the situation of the negotiations in Nanjing and the opinions of all parties that he had learned, followed by a detailed review by everyone of the party's future attitude and an overall exchange of views. It is said that Zhang and others discussed until late into the night of the 12th without reaching a decisive result. The meeting will continue on the morning of the 13th, at which time decisions will be made regarding participation in the National Assembly and the submission of candidate lists.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] A faction of the Democratic League issued a formal statement on the National Assembly issue on the evening of the 12th, as follows: "The Democratic League has repeatedly declared its support for the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and all actions are based solely on this. We are willing to make every final effort to complete all the procedures related to the National Assembly's convening as stipulated by the Political Consultative Conference. After completion, we will unanimously participate in the National Assembly. If not completed, we will temporarily not participate."</p>
<h3>National Assembly Postponed by Three Days, Symbolizing a Turning Point in the Overall Situation, Xu Fulin Issues Statement to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Xu Fulin, Propaganda Minister of the Chinese Social Democratic Party, stated to reporters on the 12th: The government's announcement of a three-day postponement of the National Assembly's opening ceremony indicates the hope that all parties and factions can participate. Our party's Zhang Junmai, Jiang Yuntian, and Sun Baogang left Nanjing for Shanghai today to prepare for convening an important party meeting within days to discuss the attitude towards the current situation in order to provide a response to the government. As for the recent informal comprehensive meetings held in Nanjing by various parties, I am not fully aware of the content of the discussions, so I cannot report on it. When asked whether the Democratic Socialist Party would take the same approach as the Democratic League regarding participation in the National Assembly, he said: The Democratic League is composed of several parties. After each party makes its internal decision, they will collectively discuss it and make a final decision. As a member of the Democratic Socialist Party, I do not intend to interfere in the affairs of the Democratic League. When asked for his views on the three-day postponement of the National Assembly, he said: This symbolizes a turning point in the overall peaceful situation. It is hoped that all issues can be resolved within these three days, because everyone is Chinese. As long as there is peace, we may as well compromise to achieve it and eliminate prejudices. Although I am not very clear about the content of the discussions between all parties in recent days, from an overall perspective, the Third Force seems to be more practical than before. In fact, if everyone sincerely solves the problem, it does not take much time. Xu also said: The current discussion content focuses on two points: (1) the constitution, and (2) the reorganization of the government. The former must complete the Political Consultative Conference review process, then be comprehensively revised by the Legislative Yuan and submitted to the National Assembly. Regarding the latter, the government advocates reorganizing the government first, convening the National Assembly, and then reorganizing the Executive Yuan. The Communist Party advocates reorganizing the Executive Yuan first, then convening the National Assembly. However, it is yet to be seen whether a compromise solution will be proposed, such as first deciding the list for the Executive Yuan's reorganization, then convening the National Assembly, and then reorganizing the Executive Yuan, etc. I really do not know, but it is also possible. Speaking to this point, Xu added with emotion: The constitution produced by this National Assembly may not be permanently implemented, because the constitutional representatives of this National Assembly were produced ten years ago. In the future, it will inevitably be criticized by some people. At the same time, there is also the suspicion of each party dividing up the spoils, saying that it cannot represent public opinion, which is not impossible. As the saying goes, "If the name is not correct, then the words will not ring true." If the foundation is not solid, it will inevitably be shaken. But even so, "bad laws are better than no laws." It is not appropriate to practice the rule of law by "temporary regulations" in the long term. The transition from one-party tutelage to constitutional government requires a bridge. We do not need to be overly pessimistic. Xu also explained that he himself is one of the representatives of Guangdong Province. As of now, he has not yet gone to Nanjing to register. If the current situation can be resolved and everyone participates in the National Assembly, there will be no problem. If it cannot be resolved, then he will only consider his personal position and decide whether or not to register. After all, one person will not affect the meeting. Finally, Xu said: There is only a way forward for China if we are sincere with each other. At the same time, he hopes that the government can quickly improve politically. If this is achieved, the unification of the overall situation will be strengthened. According to reporters, Zhang Junmai and Jiang Yuntian may travel to Nanjing tomorrow.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives Register, Sixteen Total Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] A total of sixteen National Assembly representatives registered on the 12th, including Chen Shuren, Zheng Jiemin, and Zhang Qiyun. Also, due to the postponement of the National Assembly, the preparatory meeting scheduled for today was not held. The work of various departments of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee is still tense. All departments that were supposed to be on holiday on the 12th still worked as usual.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The representatives who traveled to Nanjing by night train on the evening of the 12th included Zhang Fakui (Guangxi), Zhao Hengti (Hunan), and Zhou Dashi (Guizhou). Also, Yang Sen, Chairman of Guizhou Province, attended the National Assembly as a representative of Guizhou. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. He was originally scheduled to travel to Nanjing by night train the night before last, but stayed in Shanghai due to business. His trip to Nanjing was rescheduled. On the 12th, the National Assembly representatives who arrived in Shanghai included Zheng Yi (centrally selected), Wang Weixin (Rehe), and Li Jue (Fujian). Except for Li, who is scheduled to travel to Nanjing by night train on the 13th, the rest are scheduled to travel to Nanjing on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Female Representative to National Assembly from Xinjiang Province, Wu Jingbin, Arrives in Nanjing to Register</h3>
<p>She is the Only Elected Female County Magistrate</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Ms. Wu Jingbin, the only female county magistrate among the nation's first elected county magistrates and a representative of the Mongolian region of Xinjiang to the National Assembly, arrived in Nanjing on the 11th to register. Ms. Wu is from Zhuo Meng County in Rehe Province and the wife of the Khan of the Southern Tribe of the Old Tuerhute. She lived in Beiping for more than ten years, graduated from the Chinese Department of the Dihua Women's College, and currently serves as the County Magistrate and County Party Secretary of Hejing County, Xinjiang Province. Ms. Wu is the first Chinese woman to participate in political activities and be elected as a county magistrate. Ms. Wu told visiting reporters today: Women in Xinjiang have a spirit of hard work and endurance. In addition to raising children and doing housework, they also bear the majority of the family's livelihood, so there is no oppression by men. Female education in that area, relative to the number of men, is not much different from the interior. Women's rights are higher than in the interior, but there are still not many high-ranking officials.</p>
<h3>Zhang Lan Remains in Chengdu, Temporarily Not Going to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Democratic League, will not come to Nanjing for the time being.

<h3>Brief Overview of the Production of Representatives for the First National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] On the eve of the opening of the first National Assembly of the Republic of China, which is responsible for drafting the constitution, here is a brief overview of the process by which the representatives were produced: According to the National Assembly Representative Election Law, the original number of representatives for this assembly was 1,440, produced through four methods: regional elections, occupational elections, special elections, and government designation. Among them, regional representatives accounted for 665, occupational representatives accounted for 380, special representatives accounted for 155, totaling 1,200. The remaining 240 were designated by the National Government. In January of this year, the Political Consultative Conference agreed to the decision that of the above 1,440 representatives, the regional, occupational, and special categories, totaling 1,200, were legally valid. The 240 representatives to be designated by the government were canceled. The National Government directly selected another 700. Later, with the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the recovery of the Northeast and Taiwan, the number was increased by 150, based on the supplementary regulations for elections and the attached schedule, including the nine provinces of the Northeast, Taiwan, and other regions, as well as female representatives and military representatives, for a total of 2,050. After the National Assembly was initially decided to be convened on November 12, 1936, the National Government issued the National Assembly Organization Law and the National Assembly Representative Election Law on May 14 of that year and set them to be implemented on July 1 of the same year. The election method combined regional and occupational elections. The number of representatives stipulated that regions account for 60 to 65 percent, and occupations account for 35 to 40 percent. Those belonging to regions were divided into electoral districts based on the population of each province and city, and voting was held. Those belonging to occupations were based on the development of various industries in the local area, with agriculture, industry, and commerce divided by province and city, and free professions based on groups, regardless of region. The allocation of quotas was based on the number of members or the scope of various industries and free professions in agriculture, industry, and commerce. Based on the above principles, elections were conducted in accordance with the law in various parts of the country in the autumn of 1936, but they could not be completed before the meeting. In October of that year, the central government decided to postpone the convening of the assembly. By July of the following year, elections in various provinces and cities, except for Hebei, Chahar, Beiping, and Tianjin, had mostly been produced in accordance with the law. The allocation of quotas was as follows: For those belonging to regions, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, and Guangdong each had 44 representatives, Hunan and Hebei each had 43, Hubei had 40, Anhui had 35, Zhejiang had 33, Jiangxi had 28, Shanxi, Fujian, and Yunnan each had 22, Guangxi had 21, Shaanxi had 20, Guizhou had 16, Gansu had 14, Xinjiang had 12, Chahar and Suiyuan each had 10, Ningxia and Qinghai each had 9, Shanghai had 8, Beiping had 6, Tianjin had 5, Nanjing had 4, Qingwu and Xijing each had 2, for a total of 665. For those belonging to agricultural, industrial, and commercial professional groups, Jiangsu, Hunan, Sichuan, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Guangdong each had 21, Hubei and Jiangxi each had 18, Anhui and Zhejiang each had 15, Shanghai had 12, Shaanxi had 11, Fujian had 9, Shanxi and Yunnan each had 8, Guizhou and Guangxi each had 7, Nanjing, Beiping, and Tianjin each had 6, Gansu had 5, Kang, Qinghai, Chahar, Suiyuan, Rehe, Xinjiang, Qingwu, and Xijing each had 3, for a total of 322. There were also 10 representatives from the free professional group of lawyers, 5 representatives from accountants, 8 representatives from medical practitioners, 11 representatives from journalists, 6 representatives from engineers, and 18 representatives from educational groups, for a total of 380. Those produced by special election methods included 45 from the Northeast, 40 from Mongolia and Tibet, 40 representatives of overseas Chinese, and 30 military representatives, for a total of 155. The regional and occupational representatives numbered 1,200, of which 950 were produced in accordance with the law in 1937. However, since then, there have been 28 vacancies, leaving an actual number of 922. These are the originally elected representatives to this assembly. According to the Political Consultative Conference agreement, the 700 representatives to be directly selected by the government included 220 from the Kuomintang, 190 from the Communist Party, 120 from the Democratic League, 100 from the Youth Party, and 70 from non-partisan individuals. Based on the supplementary regulations for elections and the attached schedule, the regional, occupational, and special representatives increased by 150, including 17 from Taiwan Province, 77 from the twelve provinces and cities of the Northeast (combined with the original 45, totaling 122), 6 from Chongqing City, 3 each from the occupational representatives of Xikang and Xinjiang, 1 from Ejin Banner, 1 from Ando Tibetan area, 1 overseas Chinese from the United Kingdom, 1 overseas Chinese from Burma originating from Yunnan, 10 indigenous minorities from the southwestern provinces, 10 military representatives, and 20 female representatives. Of all the representatives who should be produced by various methods, excluding the 410 from the Communist Party, Democratic League, and Youth Party, due to the fact that these parties have not yet submitted their lists and the government has declared that the quotas will be reserved, the remaining 1,640 have been produced in accordance with the law. In addition to those who have already registered with the assembly, there are still some representatives en route who will arrive soon. According to the National Assembly Organization Law, the meeting can be convened with the attendance of more than half of the representatives. It is expected that the talents of the assembled talents will be exhausted to ensure the smooth completion of the solemn and great work of drafting the constitution.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Province Actively Investigating Public Land; Implementing Land Redistribution; Allocating Land to Farmers for Cultivation Starting Next Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th] Taiwan Province is currently actively investigating publicly owned land in order to implement a province-wide redistribution of agricultural land starting next year. In the past, most of the land in Taiwan was concentrated in the hands of the Japanese, leaving Taiwanese without land to cultivate, creating a severe land problem. According to the Taiwan Provincial Government's plan, the majority of the land currently managed by the government will be universally allocated to farmers for cultivation starting next year, based on the agricultural population. For paddy fields, each farm household is expected to receive two "jia" (each jia equals 14.5 mu), while for dry land, each farm household is expected to receive four "jia." For farms exceeding 20 "jia," cooperative farms will be established to collectively engage in production and consumption. This land distribution policy will be the first of its kind in the country's provinces.</p>

<h3>Progress in Sino-French Negotiations; Agreement in Principle on All Issues Expected by the End of the Month; China to Send Delegation to Vietnam for Further Negotiations</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Sino-French negotiations on the implementation of the Vietnam Agreement are proceeding harmoniously. The valuation of the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the restoration of the Vietnamese section are being discussed with progress by Cai Yuan, Chief Secretary of the Directorate General of Highways, and Mr. Mo, the head of the French delegation. The establishment of customs at Haiphong and the demarcation of dedicated docks are being discussed by Zhu Jin, Deputy Director of the Customs Administration, and Fang Du, Tax Commissioner of the Customs and Excise Department. A principle agreement may be reached in Nanjing, and a concrete solution will be sought after an on-site inspection in Haiphong. As for the settlement of military expenses for the Chinese troops stationed in Vietnam, Yan Zisu, representative of the National Treasury, and Gai Qixiu, representative of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, are jointly participating in the negotiations. However, due to the significant difference between the current situation and that when the Sino-French Agreement on Vietnam was signed in February of this year, there is still some distance to go. Both parties have now decided to reach an agreement in principle on all issues by the end of this month, after which the negotiations in Nanjing will end. A Chinese delegation of approximately ten experts and representatives from relevant ministries and commissions will then accompany the French economic delegation to Haiphong to make final decisions on technical matters. The formation of the delegation has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and Ling Qihan has been internally designated as the head of the delegation.</p>
<h3>Amidst Tension</h3>
<p>— Ping Su, Reporter for This Newspaper</p>
<p>Nanjing has been crowded with dignitaries these past few days. There's a shortage of hotels, a shortage of cars; besides, there's a lot of mud, a lot of uniforms, a lot of badges – and a lot of news reporters.</p>
<p>But what's most abundant are all kinds of rumors, all kinds of gossip. The political situation changes every moment, and no one dares to say for sure what will happen in the end.</p>
<p>November 11th, the day before the National Assembly was originally scheduled to open, was the day that "changed" the most dramatically. Some said the negotiators had requested a postponement to December 1st, while others said there would be no postponement, and even the representative who would deliver the reply speech at the opening ceremony on the 12th had already been decided – some said it was Hu Shi, others said it was Bishop Yu Zheng. By 4:00 PM, when Hong Lanyou hosted the representatives at the assembly hall, the result of the informal exchange of opinions among the eight or nine hundred representatives present was the selection of Kong Geng to deliver the reply speech – the meeting was still going to be held. The Preparatory Office of the National Assembly issued a notice that the official opening would be at 11:00 AM on the morning of November 12th. Premier Sun announced in the Legislative Yuan that the opening ceremony would be held on the morning of the 12th; but Premier Sun added that the government would make another important announcement at midnight on the 11th.</p>
<p>The likely conclusion seemed to be that the opening ceremony on the 12th would definitely be held, but it was not certain that the official proceedings would begin immediately after the opening ceremony, because the procedures for the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 11th had changed slightly: Mr. Wang Liangchou walked gracefully up the staircase of the Legislative Yuan at 4:00 PM, but he did not present the originally scheduled report – the deadline for the Legislative Yuan to review the draft amendments to the Constitution had been extended.</p>
<p>The National Assembly Hall had been completely decorated, and the brand-new small national flags fluttered in the evening breeze. The military police from the guard department carefully inspected the soil around the roots of the trees in the courtyard of the hall to see if any bombs were hidden there. The representatives rushed from all over the country, busy completing their registration procedures. As it gradually got darker, the zero hour of the political situation approached.</p>
<p>The negotiators were running around. The news reporters' jeeps were closely following. The phone rang more and more often. What about the more than one thousand three hundred National Assembly representatives? – One said he felt a little depressed; another said he felt "a sense of bewilderment"; many were planning small group activities after the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party still seemed very determined. The Democratic League said they would submit a letter offering new solutions. Meetings, arguments; then rushing to another place, more meetings, more arguments.</p>
<p>It got dark. What was going to happen? Everyone was still bewildered.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with only two hours left before November 12th, the tense bowstring was loosened.</p>
<p>In the reception center, the doors of the representatives' rooms suddenly opened, and the staff of the reception center said three short sentences: "The assembly is postponed to the 15th. The mausoleum visit tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM will still be held as originally scheduled. If it rains, the mausoleum visit will be canceled."</p>
<p>The negotiators were still running around, the representatives were waiting, the news reporters were waiting. The 450 million people of the entire Republic of China were enduring and waiting.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for These Three Days</h3>
<p>The government, expanding the acceptance of the opinions of those being transferred and the requests of social elites, has once again postponed the National Assembly, originally scheduled to open on November 12th, by three days, to officially open on the 15th. The National Assembly representatives in Nanjing, although inevitably disappointed that the National Assembly could not open as scheduled, yesterday all representatives participated in the memorial ceremony held by the central government at the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and faced with the visage of the Father of the Nation, who could not be filled with myriad emotions when considering the current domestic situation? Under the leadership of Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek], the people of the entire country, through the National Revolution and the War of Resistance against Japan, have already completed a portion of the Father of the Nation's teachings; however, China is backward in every aspect. In today's international environment, how can we complete the great cause of nation-building? How can we improve the national economy and the people's livelihood? And how can we get on the right track of constitutionalism? These are all urgent problems that the people of the entire country need to solve.</p>
<p>However, everything in the world has its urgency and priority. People both inside and outside the country believe that the only way out for China's current political situation is to get on the right track of constitutionalism; and the beginning of the constitutional period requires a constitution that meets the needs of the people. The opening of the National Assembly symbolizes the beginning of China's constitutional period; therefore, everyone in the country hopes that representatives from all parties, factions, and those without affiliation can gather together on the birthday of the Father of the Nation to deliberate on the fundamental law of the country. However, because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has always been unable to abandon its partisan biases and interests, it still spares no effort to obstruct the convening of the National Assembly, which not only disappoints the National Assembly representatives in Nanjing but also makes us regret the future of the CCP. Fortunately, the government, adhering to its original intention of peacefully resolving domestic disputes, has shown forbearance everywhere. It has reached the point where it can no longer tolerate or concede any further. There is absolutely no room for considering postponing the National Assembly again; however, at the last moment, the plenary session still maintained the spirit of forbearance and made a final concession by postponing the National Assembly by three days. The day before yesterday at midnight, we received the news of the postponement of the National Assembly, which rekindled a glimmer of hope for the CCP's sudden awakening. The CCP is also descended from the Yellow Emperor. Seeing Chairman Chiang's repeated acts of concession and the people's urgent desire for constitutionalism, how can they remain unmoved? Can partisan concepts really obscure all conscience? We refuse to believe that the CCP is like this. Therefore, in the three days of the National Assembly's postponement, we still hold great expectations for the government, the CCP, and the third parties.</p>
<p>First, although the postponement of the National Assembly by three days is short, it is a turning point and also the CCP's last chance; the CCP should reflect on itself, appeal to its conscience, think it over again, and not miss this last opportunity. It must be understood that the national affairs disputes after the victory of the War of Resistance have not been resolved for a long time, entirely due to the stalemate between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP. Looking back at the negotiation process over the past year, in the eyes of us ordinary people, it is vivid and very clear. We only see the government making concession after concession, even making concessions beyond the limit when it can no longer concede. We ordinary people can fully understand the government's good intentions and express our deep sympathy; however, in the negotiation process over the past year, the CCP has not only made no concessions but has also shown an attitude of taking an inch and wanting a mile. The CCP's view of party factions almost surpasses the nation-state, which has long been abandoned by us ordinary people; however, for the sake of the country's future, what is urgently needed at this moment is peace, democracy, and unity, not war, autocracy, and division. Therefore, in desperation, we can only pray for the CCP's sudden awakening. Hope has always been tenuous, but we have not yet despaired. Today, the CCP must also make some concessions! Otherwise, repeatedly obstructing the convening of the National Assembly will not only violate the public opinion of the people but will also become an obstacle on the road to nation-building. How will the CCP position itself? It should think it over carefully.</p>
<p>Second, third-party figures, including the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social elites, have been running around calling for action in the past month between the KMT and the CCP, trying to break the current deadlock in the peace talks, and have already made some efforts. However, in these three days of the National Assembly's postponement, especially at the last moment, they should make a final effort. From a higher perspective, we certainly hope that the third party's final efforts can break the current deadlock between the KMT and the CCP, so that the National Assembly can open on the 15th without further postponement, and CCP representatives can also walk into the venue amidst the enthusiastic applause of all representatives. Even if we lower our sights, we hope that at least third-party representatives will attend when the National Assembly opens. We do not need to make overly high demands; we only ask the third-party figures to calmly and quietly appeal to their conscience on this issue and ask whether obstructing the convening of the National Assembly is the public opinion of the people of the entire country. The gentlemen of the Democratic League have always claimed to be representatives of the people. Now that the people of the entire country want peace, unity, and the implementation of constitutionalism, how can they not follow public opinion and instead run around with others? Therefore, we hope that in addition to making a final effort in these three days, third-party figures must disregard the CCP's attitude and independently decide to participate in the National Assembly, which is postponed to open on the 15th. The time is pressing, and there is no room for hesitation and consideration.</p>
<p>Third, although the government's making concessions beyond the limit inevitably disappoints the people, the government's good intentions will surely gain the people's understanding and sympathy. However, we still hope that the government can find a proper solution in these three days to ensure that representatives from all parties and social elites can participate in the National Assembly. At this critical juncture, it is especially important to have a long-term vision, focus on the big picture, not argue over trivial matters, and fully demonstrate the spirit of "doing everything in our power" to break the current deadlock.</p>
<p>In short, the National Assembly has been postponed by three days, and one day has already passed. Only forty-eight hours remain. The situation has developed to this point, and it can be said that it has reached its peak. We hope that everyone in the country, regardless of party affiliation, will seize the opportunity to ensure that the democratic National Assembly, which symbolizes China's peace and unity, can open on the 15th.</p>
<h3>On the Results of the French Elections</h3>
<p>The results of the recent general elections in the United States and France are worthy of our attention in today's international politics. The first is that the United States held a midterm election for the House of Representatives and the Senate on the 5th of this month. The result was that the Republican Party, which had been in opposition for fourteen years, won and even overwhelmed the Democratic Party in both houses, gaining an advantage. The second is that France held a general election on the 10th of this month to elect members of the first National Assembly of the Fourth Republic. The result was that the Communist Party jumped to first place. If we say that the victory of the Republican Party in the United States is a sign that the American people are turning to the right, then the Communist Party's rise to prominence in France can also be said to be a prelude to the French people turning to the left.</p>
<p>According to news from Agence France-Presse in Paris on the 11th, the Communist Party received 5,351,000 votes, and the Popular Republican Movement received 4,988,000 votes, a difference of only 363,000 votes. Therefore, in the National Assembly, the Communist Party will have 164 seats, and the Popular Republican Movement will have 160 seats, a difference of only four seats. In addition, the most unexpected thing is that the de Gaulle Union only received 585,000 votes and will only have nine seats in the new National Assembly. De Gaulle had previously issued fierce criticisms of the new constitution, and he was also very active before the election. His political stance is relatively conservative. Domestically, he advocates increasing the administrative power of the president. Internationally, he advocates Anglo-French cooperation to create a Western bloc to resist foreign forces dominating the world. He is similar to former British Prime Minister Churchill. Both of them are national heroes, and the people of the entire country respect them very much, but their political ideas have not kept up with the times, and the people of Britain and France can no longer follow them.</p>
<p>The most important thing in the world after World War II is the economic recovery of various countries. After a long period of destruction by war, the people of various countries yearn for a stable life. National pride and political freedom are ultimately no match for empty stomachs. Therefore, imperialism and democratic politics will never completely replace the trend of economic improvement. Now, any government in the world that cannot improve the national economy of its own country will inevitably collapse. The British Labour Party is supported by the British people because it can nationalize important enterprises and not allow a few capitalists to monopolize them. The victory of the American Republican Party is because the Democratic Party's planned economy caused social unrest. The initial success of the Bidault government in France was also due to the fact that he disregarded everything and agreed to increase workers' wages by 25%.</p>
<p>The results of this French election show that although the French people are not completely disappointed with the Bidault government, they want to make further demands, so they turned to support the Communist Party. However, although the Communist Party received the most votes, the difference with the Popular Republican Movement is ultimately limited. The two parties must cooperate, and cooperate with other parties, in order to implement their own policies. In the future, the policies of the French government will definitely not be the policies of one party, but the harmonization of the policies of various parties. However, since the Communist Party has a majority, they also have the power to dominate government policies.</p>
<p>From the perspective of international politics, if we say that the victory of the Communist Party in this French election symbolizes the intrusion of Soviet political power into Western Europe, then that is somewhat paranoid. The French government has always maintained friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Even if the Communist Party does not win, the French government has no intention of being anti-Soviet. The French nation is the most freedom-loving nation in the world, and the French government is a truly democratic government. If a government has any autocratic tendencies, the French people will immediately rise up to overthrow it. The issue that the French people are most concerned about today is not international fronts, but the improvement of the national economy of France. The French people do not need to be an appendage of any world power. They only hope to be a peaceful, prosperous, independent, and free country. If the French Communist Party wants to build the French government into a state like Yugoslavia, they will encounter a tragic failure. Moreover, in this election, the number of votes for the Communist Party and the Popular Republican Movement is limited, and there are nearly five million voters who did not vote in this election.</p>
<p>We should express deep sympathy for this expression of French public opinion. They have deeply recognized that the center of the current world issue is the economic recovery of various countries. The people of all countries in the world urgently need a stable life. In order to obtain a stable life, we must pay full attention to governments that improve people's lives. The struggle of international blocs, the revival of imperialism, and empty talk of democracy cannot arouse the interest of the people who urgently need to improve their lives. The new French government in the future, and any government in the future, must solve this central issue. Only when this central issue is resolved can the world have peace and happiness, and the governments of all countries can be considered truly supported by the people.</p>

<h3>Anqiu Suffers Communist Catastrophe Blood Splatters Across the City and Hundreds of Students Captured Fellow Villagers in Jinan Urgently Call for Post-Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>[Report from Jinan by this newspaper] The county seat of Anqiu was attacked by the Communist "New Fourth Army" on the 4th of this month. The defending troops fought bravely, but eventually ran out of ammunition and supplies. The city fell on the evening of the 5th. Li Xianqi, captain of the Zhucheng Security Team, was killed in action. Rong Guangzhi, the head of the First Division's Supplementary Regiment, was injured. Ju Guansan, the head of the Self-Defense Regiment, committed suicide and could not be saved. Li Zhimin, the Speaker of the County Council, and Yu Xian, the Secretary-General of the County Party Headquarters, also died in the line of duty. Gao Jiren, the Deputy Speaker of the County Provisional Council, and Zhao Guansheng, a member of the County Council, along with ten others, were captured. Wang Jingyu, the Secretary of the County Council, died in battle. Li Demei, the Principal of the Provincial Anqiu Middle School, was captured, and more than 400 students were captured. Ma Huichuan and Ma Juefang, the Section Chiefs of the County Government, were killed in action. The whereabouts of the County Magistrate, Pan Jiemin, are unknown. More than 2,000 members of the Security Brigade, the County Self-Defense Regiment, and the Police Brigade were mostly killed or wounded. A large number of civilians died, but the exact number has not yet been tallied, and countless houses were damaged. This loss is an unprecedented catastrophe for the county. Because the County Council happened to be holding its inaugural meeting, and there was also an opera performance for birthday celebrations and school donations, the township and town chiefs from the rural areas all came to the city to participate, and all the party, government, military, and civilian cadres of the county were gathered in the city, so they were all caught in one fell swoop by the Communist army. After the incident, in the aftermath, the Section Chiefs of the County Government were either dead or captured, and only four staff members remained. Of the more than 1,000 students at the Provincial Anqiu Middle School, only a little over 200 remain after the rescue. The situation is so tragic that it is unprecedented among the counties of Shandong since the War of Resistance. It was not until the morning of the 7th that the National Army and Commissioner Zhang Tianzu led troops to recover the city. The Anqiu Fellow Villagers Association in Jinan held an emergency meeting on the 9th and resolved to appeal to the military and political authorities to handle the post-disaster relief.</p>
<h3>Finance Review Meeting to Be Held Today in Various Counties of the Second District of Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 12th] The Finance and Business Review Meeting of the Second Administrative District of Jiangsu Province will be held at 8:00 AM on the 13th at the Suzhou Branch of the Provincial Bank. The county magistrates and finance section chiefs of the eight counties of Su, Xi, Wu, Kun, Tai, Yu, Wu, and Cheng have already gathered in Suzhou to register. Director Dong Zhe of the Provincial Department of Finance also accompanied Director Shen Cheng of the Inspection Department, and Section Chiefs Gu Junsheng and Wei Chengzhang arrived in Suzhou by special train from Zhenjiang at about 1:00 PM this afternoon and resided at the Suzhou Agricultural Branch.</p>
<p>Five Key Points</p>
<p>A reporter from this newspaper specially went to visit on the eve of the meeting to inquire about the focus of the review meeting, as well as the review and prospects of Jiangsu's finances. Director Dong gave the following remarks: Since the restoration of the three-level financial system in July, the financial resources of counties and cities have been more abundant than before the war. If there is still a situation where revenue and expenditure are insufficient in the future, it must not be due to a poor system, but to poor management. In order to avoid this personnel defect and to make the finances of various counties and cities sound, this province has decided to convene review meetings by district. The first and fifth districts have already been held in Zhenjiang on the 9th. The focus is on five points: (1) Hearing reports on the financial business of various counties. (2) Reviewing whether the various financial laws and regulations promulgated by the province are suitable for the actual situation of various counties. (3) Discussing the plan to strengthen financial and taxation work in the future. (4) The major aspects of financial revenue and expenditure of various counties and cities in the future. (5) Financial supervisors of various counties and cities exchange opinions and seek coordination in administrative aspects.</p>
<p>Review and Prospects</p>
<p>As for the review and prospects of Jiangsu's finances, generally speaking, in the past, counties and cities that were exempt from land tax relied entirely on limited allocations from the central government. Even with the addition of autonomous donations and various special taxes tailored to local conditions, the total revenue could not offset the land tax that was exempted. Therefore, in the past year, the finances of various counties and cities were still insufficient to pay the salaries of public educators, and it was difficult to carry out any construction, which is regrettable. Now, since the financial system was reformed on July 1, the deed tax and business tax have been allocated to the local governments, and the land tax will continue to be collected in kind. In the future, the finances of counties and cities can be expected to be prosperous. However, July, August, September, October, and November are still a period of scarcity. Because the transfer of the deed tax and business tax has just begun, it is difficult to expect a strong income. After the land tax is collected in kind, it must be sold to the Grain Department before cash can be obtained. After December, it should be gradually sufficient. Subsequently, the expenditure of the county and city budgets should focus on education and construction. What is also gratifying to the society is that all special taxes tailored to local conditions in various counties and cities have now been uniformly abolished by explicit order and must not be levied again. It is learned that the review meeting is scheduled for two days, and may be extended if necessary.</p>
<h3>Village Head Instigates Robbery Harboring Bandits Exposed and Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Hefei by this newspaper] The home of Wang Xizhao, who made a living as a fortune teller in the fourth village of Dongwa Town in this city and was a well-to-do family, was broken into by seven or eight bandits on the night of the 5th, and everything was looted, resulting in the loss of hundreds of thousands of legal tender and dozens of pieces of clothing. On the 6th, Wang saw that the robbers were all living in the home of Wang Huaifa, the head of his village, and reported it to the Ninth Squadron of the Dongwa Security Team. Together with the Second Squadron of the Police Security Team, they went to arrest Wang Huaifa, Wang Honghai, Gao Huajun, and other three persons. After interrogation, they confessed that there were still accomplices, Ji Weizhang and Ji Weicheng, who were at large, so they went to the address and arrested Ji Weizhang, Ji Weicheng, Xu Bufa, Qu Linqing, Wang Li's, Wang Lagen, and others. In the afternoon of the 6th, they had been escorted to the Security Headquarters for interrogation. It was reported that Ji Weizhang had served as the captain of a puppet army, and Gao Huajun was the village cadre. This robbery of Wang Xizhao's home was instigated by the village head Wang Huaifa.</p>
<h3>Three Bandits in Changshu Immediately Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>[Report from Changshu by this newspaper] When this county launched a suppression campaign last month, it captured three bandits, Zhu Kun, Tao Liansheng, and Zhu Baoqi, in the Meili District. After being sent to the county military law court for trial, Zhu Kun confessed that he was 28 years old, from Tangqiao, Meili, and admitted that he had been a bandit for many years and had strangled Jiang Hongsheng, the head of the first village in Tangqiao Township. Tao Liansheng confessed that he was 19 years old, from Liantang, and had hidden a large number of firearms and plundered civilian property, which was too numerous to count. Zhu Baokang confessed that he was 23 years old, from Wangxian Township, Zhitang, and usually bullied the villagers and did all kinds of evil in the township. The Suppression Headquarters believed that the bandits were guilty of heinous crimes and had obtained approval from the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters to sentence them to death, which will be carried out in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Six Lake Bandits Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 12th] The Taihu Suppression Commander led his troops in an encounter with bandits on Platform Mountain in Taihu Lake on the morning of the 9th. Fifteen bandits were captured alive. Except for nine who were identified as coerced boatmen, the remaining six bandit leaders, including Liu Shenlin, were sentenced by the Wuxi Command Post. Because they independently rebelled and resisted government troops, causing our Discipline Team member Zhao Rengui (also known as Cao Yingguan) to be shot and killed, their crimes are unforgivable. They have now been uniformly sentenced to death to serve as a warning and will be executed on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Wujiang Water Conservancy Project Begins</h3>
<p>[Report from Jinhua by this newspaper] The Wujiang Water Conservancy Project in this county has established the Jinhua River Water Conservancy Council, which is responsible for supervision and guidance, in order to achieve success. It has now started construction on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>Main Culprit in Zha-Hu Road Robbery Case Apprehended</h3>
<p>[Report from Pinghu by this newspaper] Zhang Shaoqing, the main culprit in the robbery of the Zha-Yun Line bus traveling from Zha to Shanghai on the 27th of last month, has been apprehended after the County Police Bureau received a tip. Zhang had served in the Security Brigade and left his job last year due to downsizing. He wandered around Shiqiaobin in Xincang and Xinzhi Townships and rented a house in Lu Jinlong's home. During the arrest, stolen goods and other evidence related to the robbery case were also found.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Cloth Factory Requests Yarn Allocation</h3>
<p>[Report from Jiangyin by this newspaper] Chengyi has always been a yarn and cloth production area with a history of several decades. Cloth factories in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Wuchang, and other places all need Jiangyin weavers. Recently, raw material prices have soared, and it is not easy for cloth factories to maintain their operations. Pure weaving factories in Shanghai have access to cotton yarn allocation, but Jiangyin pure weaving factories have no source of yarn for weaving other than seeking the black market, resulting in a huge cost difference. The Cloth Factory Trade Association specially telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Government on the 10th to forward it to the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, ordering the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association to allocate yarn to inland factories in accordance with the joint yarn allocation system in order to maintain production.</p>
<h3>Haijian Cracks Down on Gambling Den</h3>
<p>[Report from Haijian by this newspaper] Gambling dens in Tongyuan Town have sprung up again, day and night, without any legal constraints. Idlers and loafers all flock to them. In view of the unanimous urging of public opinion, the police station dispatched police officers on the night of October 24 and cracked down on a gambling den in Gu Jiarong's store in the West Market. The owners and big spenders were fined. As a result, the various "colleagues" have been more cautious in recent days and have all temporarily announced a "shutdown."</p>
<h3>New Recruits in Hao County Enlist The Public and Their Families Line the Streets to Cheer Them On</h3>
<p>[Report from Hao County by this newspaper] This county was ordered to begin the first phase of conscription of 1,700 soldiers at the beginning of last month.

A solemn enlistment ceremony was held at 6:00 AM on the 6th, and the heads of various agencies presented the new recruits with woolen blankets, soap, and other items and participated in the enlistment ceremony, which was quite grand. Then, led by cadres and soldiers of the New Recruit Regiment of the 58th National Army Division, they paraded to the Shangqiu Railway Station. When they set off, the entire county hung flags to celebrate, and the heads of various agencies joined the ranks to cheer them on. The entire county's public and their families lined the streets to cheer them on. The strong and healthy men showed even more spirit, and their faces were full of heroism. Amidst the sounds of music and firecrackers, they drove through the familiar streets of their hometown, stepping onto the glorious path of fulfilling their military service and increasing national defense.</p>
<h3>Traitorous Special Agent Wu Shiquan Dies in Prison in Bengbu</h3>
<p>[Report from Bengbu by this newspaper] Wu Binquan, a well-known traitor who worked as a special agent for the enemy during the occupation of Bengbu, hid in the home of Guo Dianxing, a Henan native in this port, after the victory because he feared punishment.

<h3>Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce Disputes Number of Council Seats</h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxi by this newspaper] Regarding the number of county council seats, the labor union side advocates using the number of members as the standard. The Chamber of Commerce side raised an objection, arguing that the standard should be based on public associations and organizations, not the number of members.

<p>Farmers' Suffering is No Small Matter</p>
<p>The economic downturn of industry and commerce is frequently reported, demonstrating that various sectors highly value this problem. Domestic manufacturers are being overwhelmed by foreign goods, yet the majority still genuinely prefer domestic products, especially farmers. They prioritize durability and practicality over aesthetics in all their supplies. In rural homes, foreign goods are rarely seen, indicating this preference. However, the concern is the vast disparity between the value of agricultural products and urban processed goods, leading to low grain prices harming farmers and rural bankruptcy! Their annual income is insufficient to cover debts due to the high cost of artificial fertilizers and taxes. Other demands are out of the question, and purchasing power is weak, causing the decline of rural commerce, ultimately leading to the downfall of urban stores. A rural resident told us that farmers are suffering greatly, and no one speaks for us fairly! For example, now that rice has just been harvested, its price is so low it cannot cover the debts incurred for its production! To maintain credit during the harvest season, farmers have no choice but to sell cheaply to repay debts, leaving nothing for future livelihood or next year's farming! Other fundamental needs are not even discussed or considered! Also, wheat is currently expensive, but farmers have long since sold their wheat! In conclusion, if the economic crisis is not resolved by saving the rural areas, everyone will perish together! (Zhu Peide, Qingpu)</p>
<p>The area along the Republic Road used to be the border between the old Chinese and French concessions. During the Shanghai battle, the National Army built fortresses at the Xinkai River and Xiaodongmen to defend against the enemy. However, more than a year after the victory, these two fortresses still stand. Ignorant people often urinate and defecate inside, causing foul odors to spread during the summer, which is detrimental to hygiene and harms the city's appearance. It is hoped that relevant authorities will promptly dismantle these two fortresses to improve hygiene and enhance the city's visual appeal. (Guan Youshan)</p>
<p>Since Xinzhuang was incorporated into the Shanghai Municipality, contact between its administration, personnel, and the city center has become increasingly frequent. However, travel is inconvenient and time-consuming because transportation has not yet recovered to its pre-war state. Although the railway authorities adjusted the train schedules on National Day this year, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway even added two trains on the Anting-Jiading-Jiading-Shanghai route, these trains are express trains that do not stop at small stations. Therefore, the majority of ordinary citizens have not benefited from this change. In particular, merchants and travelers at Xinzhuang Station frequently witness these Jiading-Shanghai trains being delayed and stopping at the station to wait for the West Lake sightseeing train to exchange passengers, sometimes for over ten minutes. The train cars have plenty of space, but because it is not a formally scheduled stop, no tickets are sold, making it seem within reach but unattainable! Although local businesses and party organizations have repeatedly submitted requests, they have not been approved even after a month. The railway authorities may have operational difficulties, but for the sake of benefiting the majority of ordinary citizens and reducing the danger of overcrowded 42-seat passenger cars (passengers climbing in and out of windows or onto the roof is commonplace), it is necessary to make efforts to overcome these difficulties. The railway authorities should consider, without affecting the train schedule (such as the example of stopping due to delays to wait for exchanges), allowing these trains to regularly stop at Xinzhuang Station for one minute to sell tickets, in line with the principle of state-run transportation serving the public. If so, travelers from Sijing, Zhuanqiao, and other places would also benefit, not just Xinzhuang. (Yi Fan)</p>

<h3>Gu Weijun Reminds European and American Politicians: Asia's Position Cannot Be Ignored, The Soviet Union Can Easily Coordinate with the US on Disarmament</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, December 12] The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union delivered speeches expressing their views at a banquet of the Foreign Press Association last night. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun also attended and stated: "Wise statesmen will recognize the significant role Asia is playing today and continue to strive for world peace and happiness." He added that there are many significant signs of Asia's awakening, which no thoughtful politician can afford to ignore. He said that the rise of the Philippine Republic, the imminent independence of India, and the demands for autonomy from Indonesia and Vietnam all demonstrate the significant role Asia is about to play in world affairs. He also said: "To achieve the lofty goals of the United Nations, the need for organization and cooperation in the East is equal to that in the West. Through this closer cooperation, the ideal of a human parliament and a world federation will surely be realized one day."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, December 12] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated at a banquet of the Foreign Press Association last night that people all over the world truly desire peace. Considering the efforts made during the war, they should enjoy peace. Universal disarmament is an urgent task. The Soviet Union has proposed this to the United Nations, and the United States has a similar plan. The Soviet delegation intends to reach an agreement with the U.S. delegation to harmonize the two proposals. He believes this issue can be resolved at this session of the General Assembly. If the assembly can agree on a perfect plan, it can end the arms race that has already begun, reduce the military burden on the people of various countries, and raise their living standards. There is nothing better than this. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes stated that the American people elected a new Congress but do not want to change foreign policy. Our foreign policy is neither Democratic nor Republican, but for all Americans. It would be a big mistake for other governments to believe that this election indicates that the American people want to change their foreign policy.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Bevin then spoke, briefly stating that speaking of peace is not enough; it is necessary to make great efforts to ensure peace, and international constraints must be respected to be effective. Regarding disarmament, Britain took the lead after World War I, but Britain's unilateral actions almost led to disaster. Today, some accuse Britain of wanting to use atomic energy to manufacture destructive weapons, which is absolutely not true. Our country only hopes to restore its own industrial prosperity.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, December 12 (Broadcast): Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated last night that the Soviet Union is prepared to make concessions in order to reach a compromise with the United States on global disarmament, thereby ensuring lasting world peace. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes did not comment on Molotov's conciliatory attitude, but emphasized that the results of the U.S. elections last week do not affect U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<h3>The United States Plans to Draft a Military Reduction Plan to Be Submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, December 12 (Broadcast): The U.S. draft plan for military reduction will be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly within days and is currently being carefully considered by Byrnes, Austin, and others. The U.S. draft military reduction plan differs from the Soviet plan. The Soviet Union aims to implement control through international treaties, while the United States will appoint an international control agency to monitor whether there are any violations of military reduction before implementing military reduction.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, December 12] The U.S. world disarmament plan, which includes banning the private manufacture of weapons, is nearing completion and will be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly within days. It is expected that this U.S. proposal will be handed over to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, which is composed of the five major powers and is responsible for the United Nations international police force.</p>
<p>Soviet Representative Criticizes Britain, the United States, and South Africa in the Trusteeship Council</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, November 11] Soviet representative Novikov criticized Britain today in a speech to the Trusteeship Council for failing to transfer Palestine to United Nations trusteeship. He also considered the U.S. proposal for trusteeship over the former Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific to be inconsistent with the trusteeship system. Novikov's speech lasted for an hour, and representatives from Britain, the United States, and South Africa immediately spoke in rebuttal. The U.S. representative directly accused the Soviet Union of consistently obstructing the formation of the Trusteeship Council.</p>
<p>Regarding the Palestine issue, Novikov said in his speech that the fate of the area is still unresolved. Britain has not submitted a draft for trusteeship of the area, and the Soviet Union wants to know why. The Soviet Union is well aware that Britain cannot justify this. It is now clear that the British government is negotiating to resolve this issue outside the United Nations framework, on the one hand with the United States and on the other hand separately with the Arabs and Jews. This behavior violates the United Nations Charter. Novikov then said that the U.S. proposal for trusteeship over the former Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific is self-contradictory. The proposed trusteeship is merely an "expression of intention." The Trusteeship Council should be established during this session of the General Assembly. Novikov's speech mainly attacked Britain, Australia, and South Africa, saying that countries that had been mandated by the League of Nations should be held responsible for the failure to establish the Trusteeship Council. Novikov continued that the South African Union's attempt to merge the mandated territory of Southwest Africa directly violates the articles and principles of the United Nations Charter. The Soviet Union will oppose the request for merger and will insist that South Africa submit a draft for trusteeship of Southwest Africa.</p>

<h3>The Four Foreign Ministers Continue Their Meeting to Review the Peace Treaties of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, The United States Agrees to Return Seized Ships to Their Original Owners</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, December 12] The four foreign ministers conducted a preliminary review of the peace treaties of Bulgaria and Hungary yesterday morning. During the review of the Bulgarian treaty, there was a new development: Britain suggested that the Bulgarian-Greek border should be revised in the interest of Greece. Britain's proposal would strengthen Greece's position in Thessaloniki. Bevin suggested that this issue be submitted to the foreign ministers' representatives for study, which was agreed to by the U.S. and French representatives, but opposed by Molotov.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, December 12] The four foreign ministers continued their meeting last night, chaired by French representative Merville, primarily discussing the issue of Hungarian reparations. Byrnes declared that the United States intends to return all Hungarian ships currently occupied by the United States to their original owners. British Foreign Secretary Bevin then raised the issue of the future withdrawal of Allied forces from Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. Finally, they discussed the Finnish peace treaty and agreed that the Finnish government should pay 300 million U.S. dollars in reparations to the Soviet Union. In several meetings last week, the four foreign ministers reviewed a total of 65 resolutions passed at the Paris Peace Conference, of which six were adopted, five were returned to the foreign ministers' representatives for further study, and one was withdrawn.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Has 2 Million Troops Stationed Abroad, Far More Than the Combined Number of British and American Troops</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, , November 11] Lunt, a U.S. wartime intelligence officer, published an article in the November issue of "The New Leader" stating that the Soviet Union still has more than 3 million active troops, of whom 2 million are stationed outside the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has between 445,000 and 480,000 troops stationed in "non-enemy" countries. The Soviet Union is demanding that the number of Allied troops stationed in various countries be investigated by the United Nations. Britain has 195,000 troops stationed in these countries, and the United States has 132,000 troops. Soviet troops stationed abroad are concentrated in Poland.</p>
<p>As for Yugoslavia and Albania, only 10,000 troops are stationed there, and between 5,000 and 10,000 Soviet troops are stationed in Czechoslovakia. There are still 10,000 Soviet troops in Iranian Azerbaijan province. It is feared that there are no longer Soviet troops in China.</p>
<p>The number of British troops stationed in non-enemy countries is as follows: Greece 50,000, China 5,000, Egypt 100,000, East India 25,000, Iraq and Transjordan 15,000. The United States has no troops in non-enemy countries in Europe, but the number of troops stationed in other non-enemy countries is as follows: Iceland and Greenland 2,000, Panama 50,000, the Philippines 50,000, China 30,000.</p>
<p>The number of Soviet troops stationed in former enemy countries is even far greater than the combined number of British and American troops, with 1,535,000 for the Soviet Union and 520,000 for Britain and the United States. The Soviet Union has 725,000 troops stationed in Germany, while Britain has only 350,000 and the United States has only 290,000. Austria has 65,000 Soviet troops, 28,000 British troops, and 15,000 American troops. There are no Soviet troops in Italy, but there are 45,000 British troops and 25,000 American troops. There are no British or American troops in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland, but there are 470,000 Soviet troops.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has no occupying forces in Japan, while Britain has 40,000 and the United States has 140,000. There are 275,000 Soviet troops in Korea and 50,000 American troops. The British have 10,000 troops in Italian Africa, while the Soviet Union and the United States have no troops.</p>
<p>Lunt concluded that it is surprising that the Soviet Union, while maintaining such a disproportionate force, while Britain and the United States have already demobilized on a large scale, still demands an investigation into its troops stationed abroad.</p>

<h3>Truman Clarifies Policy Stance; Republican Party Guarantees Cooperation</h3>

He explained that Democrats and Republicans, both inside and outside of Congress, have participated in internal meetings to formulate and implement the government's foreign policy; he guaranteed that this would continue unchanged, as it is a national policy, not a party policy. Truman told reporters today that there would be no changes in the Cabinet and no reason to convene a special session of Congress.

His formal policy statement demonstrated his determination to remain in office. Recently, there had been many rumors that he would resign due to the Republican victory in Congress. He promised to cooperate with the future Congress and asked the Republican Party to treat him with loyalty and goodwill.</p>

<h3>Commemorating the Birthday of the Founding Father; Various Sectors Hold Grand Meeting; The Grand Theatre Venue Decorated Solemnly and Respectfully; Mayor Wu Elaborates on the Significance of the Premier's Will</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Yesterday was the birthday of the Founding Father. At 9:00 AM, various sectors of the city held a commemorative meeting at the Grand Theatre, also celebrating the convening of the National Assembly. Those in attendance included Wu Guozhen, Xie Renzhao, Xu Ji, Gu Chunfan, Shui Xiangyun, Li Ximou, Li Jianhua, Feng Youzhen, Wang Zhuyi, and over a thousand representatives from various agencies, organizations, and schools. The venue was decorated solemnly and respectfully, with a portrait of the Founding Father and the national flag of the Kuomintang in the center, surrounded by flowers and electric lights. The walls were adorned with slogans such as "National Unification, World Peace," "Return Governance to the People, Return Military Power to the Nation," "Implement Democratic Constitutionalism, Complete the National Revolution," "Respectfully Follow the Teachings of the Founding Father, Convene the National Assembly," "Celebrate the Birthday of the Founding Father, Realize Democratic Politics," and "Celebrate the Opening of the National Assembly, Lay the Foundation for Constitutionalism."</p>
<p>After the ritual proceedings, Chairman Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating that in commemorating the birthday of the Founding Father today, we recall that the goal of the revolution, as instructed in the Founding Father's will, is to seek freedom and equality for China. In the past, our country suffered from the bullying of Japanese imperialism and the constraints of unequal treaties externally, and from the separatist suppression of warlords internally. Therefore, the last two sentences of the Founding Father's will are to abolish unequal treaties and convene a national conference. The unequal treaties have already been abolished after eight years of resistance. The current convening of the National Assembly is to return governance to the people, end the period of political tutelage, and advance to the constitutional era, so that the people can obtain freedom and equality. Therefore, those who oppose the National Assembly are the great enemies of democracy. We have now heard that the National Assembly has been postponed for another three days, and we earnestly hope that it can be convened as scheduled after these three days to realize the Founding Father's teachings and achieve true freedom and equality.</p>

<p>Following this, the Secretary of the City Party Committee, Xie Renzhao, delivered a speech, stating that the Founding Father's lifelong goal of revolution was to seek equality and freedom, to abolish unequal treaties externally, and to convene a National Assembly internally. The former has been accomplished after eight years of bitter struggle, which can be reported with consolation, but the latter has been postponed again despite this convening, because the government is upholding the Founding Father's legacy of peace and struggle to save China, enduring and seeking peace and unity for the sake of the country. The purpose of the National Assembly is to begin constitutionalism and return governance to the people, as the only legitimate organ representing the people of the entire country. The people are the masters of the country, and no party should interfere in politics with military force. Instead, parliamentary representation should replace the battlefield, turning swords into plowshares. Our country's eight years of resistance were for the sake of implementing constitutionalism, and it is hoped that the people of the entire country will unanimously support it to prevent it from failing. He further stated that the Three Principles of the People are not only the doctrine for saving China, but also the doctrine for saving the world, and only the Three Principles of the People can socialize socialism and democratize capitalism, making it suitable for the global trend and meeting the needs of the people. The realization of the Three Principles of the People can avoid the occurrence of a third world war. Today, in commemorating the birthday of the Founding Father, the people of the entire country should strive to realize the Founding Father's teachings and enable all mankind to achieve the ideals of freedom and happiness.</p>
<p>After Xie's speech, Xuan Wu and Xu Ji also delivered speeches one after another, elaborating on the Founding Father's teachings and the significance of convening the National Assembly. Finally, Mayor Wu read a telegram to the National Assembly, which was unanimously approved by the entire assembly with applause, and the meeting adjourned after chanting slogans.</p>
<p>Telegram Congratulating the National Assembly</p>
<p>The text of the telegram to the National Assembly is as follows: "Urgent, Nanjing National Assembly, As we celebrate the 81st birthday of the Founding Father, your Assembly is about to open in Nanjing. All the talents have gathered, and everyone's hopes are placed on you. Inheriting the past and ushering in the future, transforming from political tutelage to constitutionalism, continuing the legacy and opening up the future, transforming from military reorganization to nation-building, respectfully adhering to the Founding Father's teachings, and permanently establishing the foundation of the people's livelihood.

We send this telegram to express our sincere wishes. Shanghai Municipal All Circles Commemorating the Founding Father's Birthday Assembly (text) Koutou."</p>
<p>Finally, the presidium led the entire assembly in shouting the slogans of the meeting: 1. Celebrate the birthday of the Founding Father. 2. Support the National Assembly. 3. Implement the Founding Father's teachings. 4. Complete democratic constitutionalism. 5. Consolidate peaceful unification. 6. Expand winter relief. 7. Return governance to the people and return military power to the nation. 8. Long live the Three Principles of the People. 9. Long live the Republic of China. The adjournment was announced amidst music at 10:40 AM. As for the parade program originally scheduled for the day, it was temporarily cancelled due to the postponement of the National Assembly.</p>

<h3>Two Railways Prevent Black Market Tickets; Change Time for Issuance of Assigned Seat Tickets</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Although the authorities of the Jin-Hu and Hu-Hang railways have repeatedly improved facilities and increased the number of trains, the situation of passenger congestion has not diminished, and "ticket scalpers" are actively engaged in rampant black market ticket sales. In order to prevent this, the North Station authorities have decided to change the time for issuing assigned seat tickets. The assigned seat tickets for the Jinling and Qiantang direct trains to Jinan and Hangzhou will be issued on the morning of the same day. The gasoline trains Xihu and Taihu are limited to sales on the afternoon of the day before. Other slow trains will still begin selling tickets three hours before departure. Although these changes cannot eradicate black market tickets, they will greatly reduce the opportunities for "ticket scalper" activity.</p>

<h3>Exhibition of Artifacts Related to the Founding Father's Deeds Extended to Close Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Zhongshan Hospital Opens; Three Floors Renovated and Fully Equipped; Serves the Public with Low Fees</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The Zhongshan Hospital on Fenglin Bridge in the city officially opened yesterday, but no opening ceremony was held. Instead, the public was invited to visit various departments from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Zhongshan Hospital was built by Dr. Yan Fuqing after raising funds from various sectors. It was completed in 1938, but unfortunately, it was occupied by the enemy before it could be used, causing extensive damage to the internal facilities. Everything from water heaters, doors and windows, , floors, etc., was damaged. After the recovery, it was actively repaired to become the most ideal hospital. The hospital is very large, with a total of six floors. Only three floors have been renovated and are currently in use, but all the equipment is perfect. For example, the X-ray room, operating room, outpatient clinics, sterilization room, emergency room, dispensary, and offices and dormitories for doctors and staff are all available. The outpatient clinics are divided into the first and second floors, and the internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and male, female, and pediatric departments are all separated from each other. Other facilities, such as the operating rooms and sterilization rooms, are very well-equipped. According to the person in charge of the hospital, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has shipped a large number of medical supplies from the United States, most of which have been donated to the hospital, such as sterilization machines, surgical tools, mattresses, kettles, and activity chairs. They are of high quality and exquisite design, and they are now being used separately.</p>
<p>The hospital can accommodate a total of 500 people, most of which are third-class beds, with low fees, based on the principle of serving the public. The daily hospitalization fee is 2,000 yuan. If food costs are included, it is 3,500 yuan. For practical needs, the hospital had already admitted patients before its opening. There are currently more than 100 patients, mostly poor people, who were transferred from the Red Cross Hospital. The current president is Shen Kefei. Those who visited the hospital yesterday included representatives from the UNRRA, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRC), the American Aid to China Association, the YMCA, the Municipal Health Bureau, the American Red Cross, and various municipal hospitals, as well as celebrities such as Liu Hongsheng, Ding Guitang, and Deng Qingshan, about 100 people in total.</p>
<h3>Four Fires Break Out in One Day; Shanghai Xin No. 2 Factory Warehouse Destroyed More Than One Hundred Bales of Cotton; One Injured Woman and Child in Nanshi and West Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Yesterday, four fires broke out in the city, injuring two women and one boy. Among them, the most serious loss was at the Shanghai Xin No. 2 Factory warehouse at No. 96 Yichang Road, where more than one hundred bales of cotton were burned. The next was the Dakang Paper Store at No. 81 Xietu Road in Nanshi at 4:40 PM, which, in addition to being burned down, also spread to the Yulin Yuan boiler room at No. 79 next door, resulting in a 19-year-old woman, Wang Chenshi, from Shaoxing, being burned on the head and fracturing her right leg from jumping out of the building.

<h3>Yongkang Ship Crew Submits Joint Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Yongkang ship flew the Italian flag in 1937 and sailed on China's inland rivers, belonging to the Italian-China Shipping Company. After the outbreak of the war, the ship was docked in Nanjing and Hankou and was requisitioned by US Third Fleet Commander Chenault and converted into an American warship. After the victory, the ship was reclaimed by the Yongxing Shipping Company and sailed between Chongqing and Shanghai. However, the ship has not dismissed its original crew for the past nine years. The accumulated salary has not been paid to this day, causing the entire crew of the ship to be unable to work for other shipping companies, which has created a significant problem in their lives. Therefore, the ship's crew has jointly filed a lawsuit with the China Marine Engineers Union for assistance. It is reported that the Marine Engineers Union has filed a complaint with the competent authorities and is investigating the ship's ownership.</p>
<h3>Promoting Education and Culture, Developing Construction Undertakings; Proposal to Exempt 16mm Films from Import Taxes</h3>
<p>Li, chairman of the Import Design Special Committee of the Supreme Economic Council, recently convened a meeting on the fifth floor of No. 24 Wai Tan Road in this city to discuss the issue of film imports. Attendees included Yao Zhichu, representative of the Ministry of National Defense, Cao Shufan, representative of the Ministry of Finance, Wu Yaoqi, representative of the Customs Administration, Wang Fushan, professor at Zhejiang University, and Sun Mingjing, director of the Department of Electrical Education at Jinling University. The focus of the discussion was on increasing the import of 16mm films to benefit construction undertakings. According to the postwar development of education and culture in various countries around the world, 16mm films are gradually replacing the reduction of 35mm films to supplement classroom education, factory technical training, military academic guidance, and public cultural inculcation. In the past, imports were restricted by the provisions of Customs Tariff No. 656, which prevented sufficient imports, whether they were 35mm entertainment films or 16mm educational films, as they were all restricted by length. From March to September of this year, 1.3 million meters were approved for import. The batch of 16mm films planned to be transported to China has 247,320 feet, reaching 100,000 feet. According to the current quota set by Customs, it is not easy to import smoothly. The American RKO company is particularly active in the production of various companies. In July of this year, the company specially sent a representative, A.C. Botluner-By, to Nanjing to contact the Ministry of Education and was invited by Vice Minister Hang to participate in the discussion. Based on the above points, the representatives attending the meeting exchanged opinions and reached a unanimous agreement, proposing that 16mm films be regarded as books, teaching specimens, and wall charts, not subject to the current quota restrictions, and requesting that they be included in the provisions of Customs Tariff Article 543 for tax-free import, in order to promote the development of China's education, culture, and construction undertakings. It is also understood that the association has submitted a report to President Zhu of the Executive Yuan for instructions.</p>
<h3>Female Painter Suspected of Collaboration; High Court Prosecutor's Office Indicts Li Qingping; Acknowledging the Enemy as Father and Befriending Enemy Gangsters; Allegedly Served as Enemy Intelligence Agent Gathering Information</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Female painter Li Qingping has been arrested and sent to the High Court Prosecutor's Office for suspected collaboration after her art exhibition at the New Life Club in the city concluded last month. Prosecutor Chen Siyong concluded the investigation, believing that she was indeed guilty, and has filed a public prosecution against her a few days ago. The High Court has now scheduled a public hearing for 2:00 PM on the 19th.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Li is currently 27 years old and a native of Jiangling, Hubei. The indictment states that after graduating from the Shanghai Xinhua Art College in 1935, the defendant served in the education sector. When the July 7th Incident occurred, she was hired as an art and music teacher by the Cheng Women's Normal School in Jilunpo. After the Pacific War broke out and the area fell, she did not return to Shanghai until April 1942 after several twists and turns. She once secretly returned to her original home in Jiangling. In the autumn of the same year, she came to Shanghai again. During these years, she visited various places such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, using painting and exhibiting as a cover. In reality, she acknowledged the traitor Chu Minyi as her father and befriended enemy naval press chief Matsushima Kei and Shiota as her informants, collecting important information from our side and reporting it to the enemy puppet regime until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau requesting her arrest, which was then handed over to the High Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, at the Huaiyang Inn in Gao Shou Lane, Aierjin Road North, yesterday at 4:00 PM, a traveler named Guo Zijun (26 years old), who resembled a retired soldier, secretly ingested arsenic to commit suicide. By the time the tea server discovered him and transported him to the hospital, he was already in critical condition due to severe poisoning.</p>
<h3>Female Reporter Xue Mei Commits Suicide by Poison; Suicide Note Complains About Han Jingqing; Tragic Background, Economic Pressure</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Xue Mei, a woman from Shaoxing, 26 years old, received higher education. Her father worked in the Ministry of Communications for many years. Before she reached adulthood, her father passed away. During the Anti-Japanese War, Xue Mei and the young Bao Dongsheng shared common aspirations and became lovers, going together to the interior, both willing to serve the country. Later, due to differences of opinion, they temporarily separated. Bao Dongsheng continued to serve in the New First Army in the Northeast, while Xue came to Shanghai. Because she had few relatives and friends, she initially rented a room in a small Nanjing hotel. Later, through an introduction, she entered a certain evening newspaper as a field reporter.</p>
<p>Around August, when all sectors of Shanghai were organizing disaster relief for northern Jiangsu, they selected "Miss Shanghai". On the 17th of that month, Xue visited the residence of singer Han Jingqing, the "Queen of Songs," at No. 189 Jiangyin Road, to interview her about her thoughts on participating in the competition. Although it was their first meeting, they felt an immediate connection, as if they had met too late. Xue shared her tragic life story and also told her that although she had a job, her food and accommodation problems had not yet been resolved, and she was still living in small hotel restaurants. Han, seeing that they were both women and that she only had a maid in her residence, immediately invited her to come and live with her. A few days later, Xue moved in with her luggage, and they confided in each other day and night, their friendship growing stronger. Over the months, Han successively provided her with over one million yuan in financial assistance. Before February, Xue was injured in a car accident in front of the New Xianlin Dance Hall and was sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment for over a month, with Han also raising 700,000 yuan for medical expenses. Last month, Han's elderly father from Hui'an came to Shanghai to visit. After discussing Xue's life story, he strongly advised Jingqing to relocate, saying that although Xue was a weak woman, he did not know her past history in detail and that rashly inviting her to live together might lead to unexpected events in the future. However, Han felt it was inappropriate to say this to Xue and asked her to move out.</p>
<p>After being ridiculed by Han's father, Xue finally understood and rented a room at No. 317, Xin Huizhong Hotel, Hankou Road. After about half a month, she again consulted with Han due to lack of funds, and Han gave her 300,000 yuan. There had been no contact for ten days. Starting on the 6th, Xue rented a room at No. 317, Great Shanghai Hotel. At the same time, Sun Haoran, a new military officer, also lived at No. 529 of the same hotel. He was a colleague of Bao Dongsheng, so he was very familiar with Xue. Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, he instructed the tea server Wang Er to check on Xue's room. Unexpectedly, he found an empty bottle of sleeping pills on the table. Xue was unconscious on the bed, indicating that she had taken poison. He also discovered</p>
<p>a suicide note that read: "Jingqing: Goodbye. I hope you will take care of my affairs after my death and not be too cruel. If you use a little less, I don't know if I'll die in anxiety. Thinking of your ruthlessness truly breaks my heart. I hope you will quickly realize. Attached is a pawn ticket. The laundry needs to be returned to you. Signed, Xue Mei, final words on November 12." Later, the hotel reported to the Lao Zha sub-bureau, and section member Zhang Guodong led police officers to investigate. They discovered a pawn ticket for a women's watch, pawned at Shengda Pawnshop at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Shilu, for a sum of 92,000 yuan. It was determined that this watch was also borrowed from Han Jingqing. Xue was transported to the Sino-American Hospital. Due to the excessive amount of poison ingested, she was still in critical condition at midnight.</p>

<h3>Social Services Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Queries</p>
<p>(1) Repurchasing Mortgaged Land</p>
<p>Zhu Hongyi asks: There are two brothers who have already divided their property. The younger brother, because he is doing business elsewhere, mortgaged eight acres of land and one house that he received in the division to his elder brother in 1931 for 400 yuan, stating that it could be redeemed at any time. Now, fifteen years later, the younger brother suddenly demands to redeem the property. However, the currency value is vastly different. How should this be handled?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] If a mortgage contract does not specify a repayment period and allows the debtor to redeem the mortgaged property at any time, and the debtor delays repayment, leading to a change in circumstances, such that repaying the debt with the same amount of currency as at the time of the mortgage would be obviously unfair, the creditor may, in accordance with the principle of changed circumstances, request the court to order an increase in payment. However, if the creditor wants to immediately take possession of the mortgaged property as repayment, both parties must enter into a separate contract. The ownership of the mortgaged property cannot be transferred solely based on the creditor's intention.</p>
<p>(2) Abandoning the Old for the New</p>
<p>Wu Minshi asks: A friend of mine has been married to Ms. Jia for over eight years and has a child of each gender. However, Ms. Jia's personality is eccentric, and the relationship between the couple is extremely weak. Last autumn, my friend met Ms. Yi, and after getting to know each other, the two became close. Before long, their friendship developed into love. Unexpectedly, Ms. Yi discovered the truth. My friend then filed for divorce from his wife. At first, Ms. Jia used sweet words to deceive my friend and made a verbal promise, signing her name on a divorce agreement (without witnesses) that my friend had written. When she later realized she had been deceived, she questioned my friend. However, the feelings between the two had already broken down. My friend's intention to divorce is even stronger. From a legal perspective, how should this matter be resolved?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] I will answer the question in two parts: (1) A consensual divorce must be in writing and must have the signatures of two or more witnesses. The so-called divorce paper, having no witnesses, is certainly not legal. (2) A divorce lawsuit must be based on one of the following situations: namely, one, bigamy; two, adultery; three, one spouse subjected to unbearable abuse by the other; four, the wife subjected to abuse by the husband's lineal ascendants, or subjected to abuse by the husband's lineal ascendants such that cohabitation is unbearable; five, one spouse maliciously abandoning the other in a continuing state; six, one spouse intending to murder the other; seven, having an incurable and serious illness; eight, having a serious and incurable mental illness; nine, being missing for more than three years; ten, being sentenced to imprisonment for three years or more, or sentenced to imprisonment for committing a dishonorable crime.</p>

<p>20,000 Elementary School Students Participate in Performances and Competitions; To Continue for Next Two Days</p>
<p>[Our Report] The 10th Shanghai Joint Elementary School Sports Meet, organized by the Municipal Bureau of Education, held its opening ceremony at Zhongzheng Park in Hongkou at 10:00 AM yesterday. Over 20,000 students participated, marking the first grand occasion since the victory. Mayor Wu personally attended and delivered a speech. The meet was originally scheduled to begin at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, but was temporarily delayed due to the large number of students from various schools participating in group exercises, making it difficult to assemble, and because the Honorary Chairman of the Organizing Committee, Mayor Wu, was attending the Founding Father's Birthday Memorial held at the Great Guangming Theater. The opening ceremony finally began at 10:20 AM. Municipal Secretary He, Deputy Director Li of the Bureau of Education, and all the staff of the Organizing Committee were present at the venue. The Xinjiang Tourist Group also attended to observe. The students from various schools were energetic and spirited. The number of spectators was an unprecedented grand occasion in the sports world since the victory.</p>
<p>Grand Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>All staff and athletes first paraded around the field. The Jiaoyang Institute played music in the melodious sound of military music. The Director of the Organizing Committee, Mr. Zhu, Deputy Directors Xun Mu and Lu Guanliu, and Secretary-General Shao Rugan led all staff, referees, and athletes around the field. School flags were flying and the steps were neat, creating a magnificent sight. After the parade, the national anthem was played, and the flag-raising ceremony was held. Deputy Director Li Ximou of the Bureau of Education delivered the opening speech on behalf of Director Gu. Director Zhu Jun of the Organizing Committee reported on the preparations. After the athletes took the oath, Honorary Chairman of the Organizing Committee Mayor Wu and representative of the Ministry of Education Zhang Tianlin delivered speeches. After the ceremony, the athletes left the field in formation. The 6,000-person group exercise then began, with neat movements and beautiful postures. The track and field events originally scheduled for the morning were postponed to 1:00 PM due to the late hour. All track and field events were able to proceed smoothly. However, the shot put event will need to be resolved by the Organizing Committee today due to impersonation and discrepancies in weight. The high jump event was highly competitive and had not been decided by nightfall, so it was also decided to be held jointly today. Mayor Wu Delivering a Speech (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>Li Ximou's Opening Speech</p>
<p>Deputy Chairman of the Organizing Committee Mr. Li Ximou's opening speech stated in part: "Education is not just about reading and seeking knowledge, but also about physical fitness and sports. Today, with so many elementary school students participating in the sports meet, we feel that education has meaning. I would like to take this opportunity to share two thoughts: First, we need to further promote sports so that all citizens of Shanghai can participate in sports meets. Second, sports are only held once or twice a year, and only last for two or three days. We must pay attention to daily sports at all times. Remember that the purpose of sports is not competition, but physical exercise." Report on Preparations</p>
<p>Director Zhu Jun of the Organizing Committee then reported on the preparations, stating in part: "This sports meet is ten years after the last one. It was approved by the Bureau of Education's meeting a month ago and approved by the Mayor. Preparations began immediately. The time was short, and the funding was not much, but the number of participants in this session is extremely large. The group exercise involved 61 schools, 117 groups, and 5,850 people. The group performance involved 76 schools, 126 sections, 6,817 students, and 147 teachers. The track and field events involved 117 schools and over 2,300 people."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech</p>
<p>After the report, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, saying: "Today, so many children and guests are participating in the sports meet, which is a good sign of China's progress. Although we have abolished the unequal treaties, we are still not equal to foreigners in terms of physical fitness. We need to exercise more. Today, I have two things to say: First, I don't hope for good results, I hope that sports can be popularized. Second, don't compete for victory or defeat, learn to observe discipline and order."</p>
<p>Representative of the Ministry of Education and Assistant to the National Education Department Zhang Tianlin then delivered a speech, elaborating on the three points of sports and national life, sports and overall national defense, and sports and competitive ethics. Finally, He Dekui delivered a speech, saying: Today, the children are energetic and well-trained. Such a large-scale sports meet is well-organized, which shows meticulous organization.</p>

<h3>Lei Shuping Scores a Last-Minute Header; Youyou Draws with Qingbai; 1-1, Yi Yuan Football Produces an Upset</h3>
<p>In the A-League football match between Qingbai and Youyou yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at Yi Yuan Stadium, attended by over 5,000 fans, the situation was intense. As a result of the competition, Qingbai scored a goal in the first half by Li Yichen. One minute before the end of the second half, Youyou's Lei Shuping scored a header, tying the game, which was unexpected by the fans. The match was tense and unparalleled. Youyou defended strictly, preventing Qingbai from achieving success.</p>
<p>Qingbai Attacks First</p>
<p>Li Yichen led the forwards into Youyou's territory. Right winger Jiang Qing received a pass from Xiao Gu and shot towards the center. Li Yichen took the opportunity to knock on the door. Ladi rushed out to save, resulting in an empty goal. Fortunately, Zhang Rongguang saved the day, turning danger into safety. After ten minutes, Xiao Luo crossed from the left corner, but Li Yichen was too hasty and made a fruitless effort. Youyou counterattacked, with Wang Nanzhen launching an offensive on the left, but was blocked by Wu Qixiang. In the melee, at the eighteenth minute, A-Kui passed to Luo Shoufu, who passed to the center again. Gu Yisa feigned a stand-off at Huarong Road. Li Sikai shot powerfully near the goal, and Ladi was unprepared and lost the goal. Qingbai 1-0</p>
<p>Record Opens First</p>
<p>At this time, Mao Hongfa was injured and left the field, replaced by Villa. After contact, Youyou Yunfeng launched an attack from the middle, passing to the front line. Villa held the ball and shot, but it was slightly high and missed. Soon after, Villa passed to the center, and Lei Shuping knocked on the door but was embraced by Qin Bigao. Qingbai took the opportunity to attack, and Jiang Qing penetrated alone and attacked fiercely near the goal. Fortunately, Ladi was quick-eyed and caught the ball, avoiding a disaster. Before long, the first half ended, with Qingbai leading 1-0.</p>
<p>Restart after Break</p>
<p>Youyou made minor changes to its lineup. Wang Chunjian retired, Wang Nanzhen moved back, and Zhu Meilong replaced Nanzhen. Qingbai's forwards Xu Wenkui and Gu Yisa switched positions. Both sides returned to the field, and in Youyou's territory, enemy cavalry could be seen crisscrossing. Li Yichen, Luo Shoufu, and Gu Yisa attacked without success. Brini and Zhang Rongguang parried from left and right, looking busy. After ten minutes, Li Yichen shot from a distance, and the ball flew like an arrow, but Ladi jumped up and caught it. Chen Xiaoping counterattacked, with Cao Qinfang and Liu Shizan supporting from left and right. Unfortunately, they were too short, and Yan Shixin and Wu Qixiang, a pair of iron gates, were difficult to cross. At the twenty-fifth minute, Wu Qixiang accidentally collided with Cao Qinfang, resulting in a free kick, 30 yards from the goal. Brini took the kick, but Qin Bigao embraced it. Soon after, Qinfang received assistance from Shizan and shot from the crowd, but was again blocked by Bigao. At the fortieth minute, Wu Qixiang was injured and left the field, replaced by Xue Peiran. Qinfang</p>
<p>seized the opportunity to enter. Meng Yiliang blocked it into a corner kick. Villa crossed from the right corner, and Lei Shuping rushed out from a cold alleyway, heading it in. Youyou tied the game 1-1. Within a minute, the legal time ended, and Qingbai and Youyou drew. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingbai</p>
<p>Qin Bigao Yan Shixin Wu Qixiang (Xue Peiran) Yongfu Meng Yiliang Gao Baozheng Xu Wenkui Luo Shoufu Li Yichen Gu Yisa Jiang Wenqing</p>

<p>Ladi</p>

<h3>Practical Problems with Yarn Allocation</h3>
<p>More Coarse Yarn, Not Enough Fine Yarn, Difficult to Coordinate with Practical Use; The Replication Association Hopes That Fellow Traders Can Adjust Products</p>
<p>The yarn allocation work jointly carried out by the Yarn Factory Association and the Cotton Yarn Replication Products Industry Association's Yarn Allocation Committee has reached its third phase. The first time was on October 28th, with 5,803 pieces of various counts. The second time was on the 4th of this month, with 5,626.25 pieces of various counts. The third time was on the 11th of this month, with 5,464 pieces of various counts. Each time, they applied for a combined 6,002 pieces of 20-count standard yarn. The replication industry has repeatedly complained that the counts applied for and the counts received do not match, causing some complaints. According to sources from the yarn factory industry, the allocation is based on the production situation of each factory. The Textile Management Committee is waiting for the Replication Association's list to consider adjustments. According to news from the Replication Association, before the first yarn allocation, the application books reported by the dyeing and weaving, knitting, underwear, towel and blanket, and hand-woven cotton industries showed 409 pieces of coarse yarn below 16 count, 3,088.25 pieces of 20 count common yarn, 1,619.5 pieces of 32 to 42 count medium fine yarn, and 47 pieces of fine yarn above 60 count. The yarn allocated by the yarn factories each time always has an excessive surplus of coarse yarn and a severe shortage of medium fine yarn. In the most recent period, only about two-thirds of the original application amount of 20-count common yarn was obtained. However, the total amount of coarse yarn below 16 count reached 1,340 pieces, which is more than three times the original application amount. Among them, for 10 count yarn, the original application was for over 20 pieces, but this time 776 pieces were allocated, which is more than 36 times the original amount. This has led to an increasing shortage of medium and high-quality fine yarns. Medium fine yarn is also a common commodity used by small and medium-sized factories to weave woolen fabrics and knitwear, underwear handkerchiefs, etc., and the insufficient distribution is particularly inconvenient. The Replication Association has consulted with the industry to consider adjustments, and last time they returned several hundred pieces of 10 count yarn after receiving the allocation. This time, not only has it not decreased, but it has increased further, which is a major headache. The yarn allocated by the Textile Construction Company has tried to be as close as possible to the practical use of the replication industry, and fine yarn has been particularly well maintained. The Replication Association has expressed its satisfaction with this. According to Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the Replication Association, both the allocating and receiving parties should be mutually tolerant and understanding in order to cooperate. There must be a considerable reason for the large amount of coarse yarn on the yarn factory side, and it is hoped that the industry can adjust its products to accommodate this raw material. Therefore, several hundred pieces have been carefully considered in the previous and current allocations. However, at the same time, it is hoped that the yarn factory industry will pay attention to this de facto dilemma and provide assistance. Mayor Wu has long expressed that yarn allocation must be in line with practical use, and there should be adjustments from the next allocation onwards.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Distribution of Rayon; Central Trust Bureau's Investigation Still Not Completed; Small Factories' Purchasing Leads to Black Market Price Increases</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] It is reported that the second batch of 2,000 cases of rayon from the Central Trust Bureau has already been loaded onto ships in Japan and is on its way to China, and should arrive in Shanghai within days for distribution to stabilize the price of rayon. It is estimated that of the Central Trust Bureau's first batch of 4,800 cases of rayon, only about 2,000 cases have been distributed up to the previous month. After the arrival of the second batch of 2,000 cases of Japanese rayon, the total inventory will be sufficient for the distribution volume within the year.</p>
<p>Also, the price of rayon has recently soared again due to supply falling short of demand. It is reported that the silk weaving industry association's members sent the application forms for November to the Central Trust Bureau, but the Central Trust Bureau has not yet completed the investigation, so the distribution quota is temporarily shorter than the previous month. Also, the Textile Construction Company has also started to suspend distribution since last week. Small factories, unable to continue receiving allocated goods, and also being forced by production needs, had to purchase from the market, which created an opportunity for holders to raise prices.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Loan; Machines Not Allowed as Collateral; Flexibility Allowed When Loan Expires</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The 375 member companies of the Shanghai Silk Weaving Industry Association, after the approval of the Four Joint Offices, and especially after applying for loans, the industry association once applied to the Central Bank for permission to use machines as collateral. It is now known that this request has been rejected by the Central Bank. If factories wish to apply for loans, they must still use raw materials at 30% of the market price or finished products at 70% of the market price as collateral. It is rumored that the authorities, in order to understand the difficulties of businesses, have agreed to consider flexible solutions when the loan expires. The deposit period is three months, with interest calculated at a monthly rate of 5%. The loans are undertaken by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. Other institutions, such as the Central Trust Bureau, provide loans through the Bank of China. The Farmers Bank of China provides loans through the Bank of Communications. The loans of each linked bank account for 40% of the total loan amount of each lending bank. Each lending bank can still apply to the Central Bank for re-mortgage with collateral at 70%, calculated at a monthly interest rate of 3%.</p>
<h3>Excessive Business Tax; Cigarette Industry Seeks Amendment; Native Cloth Industry Also Seeks Exemption</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce believes that the business tax burden on cigarette wholesalers in the city is extremely heavy. At the request of the industry association, it has requested the Finance Bureau to change the method of collecting business tax on each item and to crack down on cigarette shops and street stalls without store numbers or licenses in alleys and streets in order to protect legitimate commerce. As for the new method of collecting business tax, the cigarette industry association suggests two options: (1) Formulate a simplified method for collecting cigarette business tax separately, and fill out the amount of business tax to be paid in simplified collection based on the quantity and price allocated in the factory's delivery note, and take it to the Finance Bureau to pay the tax due in one go. Or (2) Specify a special rate for collecting cigarette business tax, and use the profit obtained by each wholesaler as the standard for collection.</p>
<p>Also, the Shanghai Native Cloth Merchants Association believes that the producers and consumers of native cloth are all poor people who cannot bear the burden of business tax, and has requested the City Chamber of Commerce to request the Ministry of Finance to approve exemption from collection. It has also telegraphed the Chamber of Commerce Federation to appeal on its behalf.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Statistics, September-October</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to the survey by the Business Department of the China Textile Construction Company, the total amount of cotton yarn sold by local and out-of-town merchants in Shanghai in October this year was 39,000 pieces, but the total amount actually sold was 33,900 pieces. Among these figures, Shanghai accounted for 14,405 pieces, the Yangtze River region accounted for 8,895 pieces, South China accounted for 7,360 pieces, Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou accounted for 5,365 pieces, and North China accounted for 2,975 pieces. Also, the total amount of cotton yarn traded in September was 54,300 pieces, and the total amount actually sold was 41,000 pieces.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Transporting Tea Due to Procedures; Industry Asks for Separate Improvements</h3>
<p>Since the government allowed goods for export to be temporarily transported on account and required export within three months, with the guaranteeing merchants responsible for paying taxes if overdue, there has been a turnaround in the tea export trade. However, merchants feel that the guarantee certificate, which stipulates that it must be guaranteed by other stores, is quite difficult. At the same time, due to the slow handling of goods by government agencies, and the fact that most Zhu Jun do not have tax agency personnel, more than 10,000 boxes of tea that have been manufactured by Zhejiang's industry merchants are piled up in places such as Haoba and Cao'e and cannot be exported. Currently, tea merchants in Shanghai and Hangzhou are requesting the government to change the guarantee certificate procedure to joint guarantee by the same industry, and to request the tax bureau to set up on-site personnel first, and to have the Shanghai Agricultural Bank provide proof for the boxes of tea that have been manufactured but have not been transported to Shanghai in advance due to tax reasons.</p>
<h3>Fir Timber Prices Rise</h3>
<p>In the timber market, fir timber prices have been rising sharply. Due to difficulties in the source of supply from Fujian, market prices have risen. Foreign pine is stable due to news of sharp price increases from abroad, and sellers are mostly stopping sales.</p>
<h3>Business in Northern Goods Trade Is Sluggish</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Among the Northern goods, red and black dates, walnuts, and other products are often prepared by the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang as winter supplements. The annual peak season is from July to October. During this period, merchants from other places come to Shanghai to handle business in preparation for sales in the winter. However, according to people in the industry, the recent situation in the Northern goods trade has been uneventful. The market prices of various goods tend to be sluggish. According to reports, the main sources of supply for various goods in the industry are the areas along the Longhai Railway. The more well-known ones include red and black dates, almonds, melon seeds, and walnuts from Tianjin and Jinan, Shandong. Recently, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been transporting goods from these two places, so the mutual exchange of goods is relatively smooth. Secondly, golden needle mushrooms, peanuts, melon seeds, etc. from Gaoyou and other places in northern Jiangsu mostly come from Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Jiangyin and other places. Recently, due to the pacification of the local area in northern Jiangsu, the arrival of goods is also smoother than before. Unfortunately, the weather has been cold late this year, and the purchasing power of the general rural population has been greatly weakened due to the low price of grain, which has affected the sales of goods. People in the industry believe that because various industries in the market have been sluggish recently, they are afraid that the industry's prospects this winter will not be able to get rid of the shackles of the recession.</p>
<h3>American Sugar Industry Investigation Team Arrives in Shanghai; Investigates Whether American Varieties Can Be Promoted in China; Two Team Members Fly Directly to Taiwan for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The head of the American Sugar Industry Investigation Team, Mr. Landies, arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. There are two other members of the team, who are said to have flown directly to Taiwan for investigation. According to related people, Mr. Boer is a well-known sugar industry expert in the United States. He was ordered by the Ministry of Agriculture to come to China for investigation. His main task is to first study the possibility of planting a large amount of American sugar cane in China. In the past, American sugar cane was tried in Sichuan, and the result was that the sugar production rate increased to about 60%. In the past, the Japanese also achieved very good results in planting American sugar cane in Taiwan. Mr. Boer's second task is to study the production and sales situation of world sugar after Taiwan returned to China, as the situation has changed dramatically and needs to be studied. After inspecting Taiwan, the team may go to Hainan Island to study the possibility of planting a large amount of sugar cane on the island. The reporter interviewed Mr. Boer yesterday afternoon, but he could not express many opinions due to the fatigue of the journey. However, he learned that he will probably fly to Taiwan this Thursday, and Peng Shaoguang, a technician from the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute specially appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, will accompany him.</p>

Mr. Tang inspected a total of 22 central national schools, national schools, and private elementary schools in the two cities. The common phenomena of each school are: (1) Overcrowded classes: The number of students in large classes is as high as 125 people, and classes with 70 to 80 people are considered normal. Education is narrow and there are too few seats. (2) Most of the school buildings in each school are damaged, with dilapidated walls and ruins everywhere. Some schools have classes in the open air, and some have classes in classrooms with roofs that are about to collapse, disregarding the safety of children. (3) Lack of equipment: It is rare for schools in the two cities to have a complete classroom for each class. Only a few private schools have other specialized classrooms. Most of the sports fields are too small and lack equipment. As for the campus, no school has one. (4) Meager treatment: The monthly salary income of teachers in each school in the two cities is very low. The minimum salary in Beijing is 55 yuan, and the maximum is 85 yuan, so the monthly income is at most 135,000 yuan. However, the salary for these months has not been paid according to regulations. (5) Large number of out-of-school children: It is estimated that there are about 144,974 school-age children in Beijing. The number of children in school is 83,873, and the number of out-of-school children is 61,151, accounting for 42% of the total number of school-age children.

<h3>Professor Pei Fei Gives First Public Lecture in Beijing; Advocates That Mankind Should Establish a World Country</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beijing, 11th] Professor Pei Fei, an expert on international issues, gave his first public lecture in Beijing at Peking University at 4:00 PM today, entitled "Can All Countries of the World Be Organized for Peace?" After being introduced, Professor Pei Fei gave a 90-minute lecture, stating briefly: In the past 100 years, mankind has experienced two world wars, which is the most tragic century in human history. In order to prevent future wars, national borders are no longer necessary. Mankind should establish a world country, and the current countries should retreat to the status of provinces and cities in this future organization, but still be able to retain local characteristics, laws, and lifestyles, especially in culture, and still be self-reliant. He also said that this world country cannot be realized in the short term. It must go through a transitional period. If the current United Nations can be improved, there will be an organization that is stronger than all countries and can sanction and subdue countries that endanger regulations. Then the world country will definitely be formed in the future. Mr. Pei also stated that the United Nations is supported by Western countries, and whether it can continue to exist can be determined after a test, and this test will definitely come in the short term.</p>

<h3>Inspection Record of Chahar-Suiyuan Border Area, Inside and Outside the Great Wall (2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Hang Zhou</p>
<p>The troops of the Twelfth War Area are not many, perhaps the fewest of all war areas in the country. In terms of military strength alone, Fu Zuoyi is far from being the enemy of He Long, the commander of the Joint Defense of the Five Provinces of Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, and Shaanxi of the Communist Army, and Nie Rongzhen, the commander of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Military Region. The Twelfth War Area has jurisdiction over the entire Suiyuan Province, the entire Chahar Province, thirteen counties in northern Shanxi, and the Yulin area in northern Shaanxi. For such a vast defense zone, Fu Zuoyi only has two armies: the 35th Army and the Provisional 3rd Army, as well as a cavalry division and a supplementary division. In addition, there are the 38th Division guarding Datong and General Ma Zhanshan's 5th and 6th Cavalry Divisions, which were transferred from the Second War Area to Fu Zuoyi's command. As for the Communist Army, He Long and Nie Rongzhen have a combined force of more than 150,000 men. Fu Zuoyi, with fewer troops, drove He Long and Nie Rongzhen's troops into the Taihang Mountains. This was due to the dedication of the officers and soldiers and the cooperation of the people. Therefore, he called the Jining Campaign, the decisive battle between the Kuomintang and Communist forces in Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan:</p>
<p>[The Victory of the People's Will and the Soldiers' Resentment!]</p>
<p>The Datong·Jining·Zhangjiakou Trilogy</p>
<p>The Jining Campaign was triggered by the Communist Army's frantic attack on Datong starting on August 3rd. If Datong fell, not only would Taiyuan be in danger, but Suiyuan and Baotou might be surrounded again. At that time, Fu Zuoyi was stationed in Guihua and repeatedly telegraphed the Communist authorities to stop the attack on Datong, otherwise it would probably cause a major war. When the telegram persuasion was ineffective, Professor Zhou Beifeng of Shanxi University was sent to Jining and Fengzhen in late August to personally persuade He Long, Xiao Ke, and others to stop advancing. This person disappeared after arriving in Zhangjiakou, but the fighting around Datong intensified. The isolated army in Datong was struggling to defend itself, and the situation was precarious. Fu Zuoyi was forced to convene a meeting of officers above the rank of regimental commander in Guihua to discuss countermeasures. The officers issued a unanimous roar: "Rescue Datong!"</p>
<p>Therefore, General Dong Qiwu was ordered to lead three divisions: the 31st Division, the 17th Division, and the 11th Division, to send troops from Suiyuan and Baotou, and the 101st Division as a backup team. On September 5th, they first fought with the Communist Army at Zhuozi Mountain. The National Army advanced with a heavy heart. As the saying goes, if you don't fight, you don't fight. Once you fight, the mournful soldiers will surely win! The Communist Army in Zhuozi Mountain was ordered to defend to the death for two days, but the National Army took it down within two and a half hours, and continued to advance along the Ping-Sui Railway towards Jining. Jining has a dangerous terrain and the most solid fortifications. The main strongholds in the suburbs, such as Tiger Mountain, Wo Neng Mountain, and Tie Jun Mountain, all have bunkers built of steel and concrete, with five layers of various shapes of barbed wire, electric wire, and two outer moats. The streets and houses in the city are also equipped with street fighting fortifications. The Communist Army gathered its forces there, reaching seventeen brigades and fifty-one regiments, claiming that they would annihilate the National Army.</p>
<p>The Battle of Jining began tragically on September 10th. Although the troops of the Twelfth War Area have been reorganized, they are not equipped with new equipment, and still use old weapons. The price paid for attacking such modern fortifications is huge. The two armies surrounded each other layer by layer. General Dong Qiwu was also surrounded in the Communist Army's circle and did not eat anything for two days and two nights. In the melee between the two armies, the rigorously trained National Army demonstrated their skilled combat techniques, fighting on their own, one against ten, and fighting bravely. The Communist Army suffered heavy casualties, but still stubbornly resisted with fortifications. After four days and nights of bloodshed, the National Army was almost unable to hold on, but when the National Army could not hold on, it was also when the Communist Army was about to collapse. At this critical moment, the National Army's backup team - the 101st Division - arrived in time to join the battle, captured the main strongholds in one fell swoop, and completely recovered Jining on the 14th. The number of Communist Army corpses on the battlefield reached 23,700, and the injured were twice as many. The National Army suffered about 5,000 casualties.</p>
<p>With Jining captured, most of the main force of the Communist Army has been defeated, and the siege of Datong has been lifted, and the road to Zhangjiakou has been opened. However, the National Army did not continue to advance, giving the Communist Party a chance, hoping that they would accept Chairman Chiang's proposal to cease fire for ten days and resume negotiations. Unfortunately, the Communist Party rejected it; at the same time, they also publicized that they would use 500,000 troops to defend Zhangjiakou and annihilate General Sun Yingzhong's troops near Huailai. This is tantamount to another act of challenge.</p>
<p>Dong Qiwu led the four divisions to stay in Jining for twenty days, clearing the Communist Army within Suiyuan. After twenty days - on November 5th, they began to advance towards Zhangjiakou. Beforehand, they obtained intelligence from the Communist Army that heavy troops were deployed along the railway line, while the Great Wall line was very empty. They detoured fifty miles, and marched rapidly from north to south, completely beyond the expectations of the Communist Army. They rushed to Zhangbei in one breath. The Communist Army in the city was still singing and dancing, completely unaware of the movement of tens of thousands of troops. They were caught off guard and most of them were annihilated by the National Army. The major fortresses on the Great Wall line, such as Langwo Gully and Shenwei Terrace, were all taken down by the National Army in a quick battle, sweeping down with irresistible force. In seven days, they advanced five hundred miles, and entered Zhangjiakou without a fight at 11:50 am on the 11th. Nie Rongzhen, the Communist Army's defending general, gave a "last fond look" and fled after setting the city on fire. This fire burned terribly, leaving an eternal mark of hatred on the people of Zhangjiakou.</p>

<p>The Zhangjiakou train station after being burned</p>
<h3>The Shattered Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>We spent half a day observing the situation in Zhangjiakou after the robbery. In front of those sturdy buildings that were burned down, in front of those damaged, delicate and huge machines, ... the people after the robbery pointed to us with tears in their eyes, and we accepted their tears one by one; we also saw anger on their faces, and we accepted their anger one by one. During the inspection in North China, I deeply felt that the Japanese had a long-term intention to occupy North China, so they focused on construction and development; they were less energetic in Central and South China. In Zhangjiakou, the construction of the Japanese in the past eight years has been quite considerable. The defeated Japan surrendered, and we took over many constructions intact. If we use these Japanese constructions as part of the capital for building the country, perhaps the lives of the people would have improved. But the Communist Party is unwilling to do so; it claims to "represent the interests of the people," but in fact, it does not know how much hatred it has with the Chinese people, and it wants to cut off the vitality of the people everywhere. When it retreats in Zhangjiakou, it sets fire to the city, as if it has to do so. (The fate of the cities that were occupied and then retreated by the Communist Army is the same). But what it burned is not something that belongs to the Kuomintang government, which it considers hostile (it only makes the Kuomintang government bear more responsibility); what it burned belongs to the country and the people. If the Communist Party is not hostile to the entire country and patriotic people, there is really no reason to do so.』 If it is said that making the entire Chinese economy bankrupt is the basis of the Communist Party's "revolution," so that the poor have no choice but to follow it to rob and loot, then it is even more unwise! What I saw was: even the poorest people, when they mention the Communist Party - no, the suffering people call it the "Bankruptcy Party" - their eyes are filled with anger!</p>
<p>According to the survey statistics of the Temporary Political Affairs Committee of the Twelfth War Area, among the forty companies and factories originally in Zhangjiakou, such as the electric power company, the petroleum company, and the flour mill, only the water company was not damaged. According to local people, this was because the Communist Army did not have time to destroy it. The rest were either completely destroyed or partially damaged. The main industrial areas of Zhangjiakou are in Xuanhua and Xiahuayuan, where all the factory parts were also destroyed. In particular, the power plant in Xiahuayuan, with a generator of 20,000 kilowatts, was completely destroyed. The total amount of the loss is impossible to estimate. God knows when it will be able to restore its former appearance!</p>
<p>Following the route, we first looked at the North Power Plant, which originally had a 300-kilowatt generator. The workers were picking up parts, repairing and assembling them. Minsheng Electric Power Co., Ltd., located in the downtown area, only has a charred shell left. In the telephone bureau, the damaged parts are scattered all over the place. The original 4,000 automatic telephone sets were taken away by the Communist Army, and the rest were burned. Now the Ministry of Communications Telephone Bureau only brought 31 manual telephone sets to maintain telephone communication. Several female operators are already "veterans of three dynasties." In a chat, they told me: "The Eighth Route Army is even more ruthless than the Japanese."</p>
<p>"Why?" I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>They swept their eyes over the destroyed parts, and then looked at me, as if telling me: "You should have known it long ago"!</p>
<h3>"Prodigal Sons" Blow Up Water Towers, Shaking Up the Workers' Minds</h3>
<p>When we arrived at the train station, everything we saw was heartbreaking: the overturned water tower, the fragmented locomotive and carriages, only a few charred wooden station buildings and the faces of the workers sighing in the ruins. A worker in his seventies said: The Eighth Route Army burned the station on the evening of the second day before the arrival of the National Army. He was sleeping on the kang when he was awakened by a flash of fire. He counted and found that there were a total of twelve fires. He watched his "partners" in life - everything at the station - was all over. He had no idea, and the resentment made him ashamed. He was ashamed to see the Chinese doing such a useless thing on their own land! He wanted to jump into the fire! The Eighth Route Army used more than twenty tons of yellow explosives to blow up the water tower. With a sound like the collapse of the sky and the cracking of the earth, his mind was cleared instead. He pointed to the water tower and said to us: "I built it under the humiliation of the enemy; now it is destroyed by the prodigal sons! Sir, I want to rebuild it! When you start work, don't forget me."</p>

<p>The Zhangjiakou Grand Iron Bridge was tragically cut in half, like a patient who is half-paralyzed</p>
<h3>The Grand Iron Bridge Was Tragically Cut in Half, Like a Patient Who Is Half-Paralyzed</h3>
<p>The Zhangjiakou Grand Iron Bridge is a great project, and the bridge is more than a mile long. When we saw it, it had been cut in half, like a patient who is half-paralyzed. The method used by the Communist Army to destroy this bridge is very peculiar, and probably only the Communist Party members who have attended the "Destruction University" can think of it.</p>
<p>Yellow explosives were placed in the center of the iron bridge, and two locomotives were driven towards it from both ends. After wiping away a tear, the driver of one of the locomotives broke a part of the machine. The locomotive was stopped at the bridgehead and did not move forward. The driver of the other locomotive had no choice but to open the throttle, and he jumped out of the car first. The locomotive drove to the center and detonated the explosives. It was blown to pieces, and the bridge was blown off like a sugarcane. The debris fell on the already dry Qinghe River, as if to provide permanent proof of the Communist Party's masterful masterpiece. The person in charge of the Ping-Sui Railway Administration Machinery Section has a general investigation report on the damage along the east and west lines with Zhangjiakou as the center, east to Huailai and west to Yanggao. (1) Damage to the east line: A, 42 bridges and culverts. All the steel rails, sleepers, fishplates, track spikes, and screws on the bridges were mostly lost. B, about 20 kilometers of the line were damaged, more than 550 steel rails were lost, and more than 18,000 sleepers were lost. C, the buildings of the stations along the line, except for Ningyuan Station, were all burned down. (2) Damage to the west line: A, more than 150 bridges and culverts were almost completely destroyed. B, 800 to 900 steel rails were lost, most of the sleepers were gone, all the power poles were destroyed, and the water towers of Chaigoubao and Tianzhen collapsed. (3) Equipment damage: A, 16 locomotives were damaged to varying degrees. B, 12 passenger cars and 117 freight cars were damaged. C, 80% of all equipment was taken away by the Communist Army, and more than half of the rest were destroyed.</p>
<p>If Zhan Tianyou, the "father of the Ping-Sui Railway," knew about it underground, I think he would definitely beat his chest and cry!</p>
<p>After the Railway Bureau rushed to repair it, the section between Zhangjiakou and Beiping can be opened to traffic in mid-month; the section between Zhangjiakou and Datong is severely damaged, and the repair is costly and laborious. Materials are being purchased and civilians are being hired to carry out emergency repairs in stages, which are expected to be completed in one month.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, we only saw one-tenth or two-tenths of the damage, but that was enough for us. A tragic picture has formed in my mind. This picture is constantly moving in front of my eyes, and suddenly it changes its appearance. I seem to see Mr. Zhou Enlai and other "eloquent" gentlemen of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing and Shanghai shouting slogans such as "democracy," "freedom," "peace," and "happiness" at the meeting table. I have no leisure to satirize them. I only feel that if Mr. Zhou Enlai and others know what his "comrades" are doing on the land on which the people's lives depend, he must have lost that "shameless" courage, otherwise, he must be a patient of hysteria.

<h3>The Six Hundred Thousand Jews Support the Jewish National Movement Will Force the British to Change Their Attitude</h3>
<p>— Translated by our editorial department from World Report, South</p>
<p>There is a risk of guerrilla warfare throughout Palestine. Jews and Muslims are moving towards extremes, with no room for compromise. Which side Britain will favor is indeed a question worth noting, as it will have a profound impact on the situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Jewish underground forces have already begun military activities, attempting to attract 100,000 Jewish refugees to participate. Arabs are also armed, and if Britain concedes to the demands of the Jewish National Movement, they are also prepared to take similar measures.</p>
<p>Jewish leaders used to oppose violence, but the reason why extremists are gaining ground is that the general public believes that only force can compel Britain to change its policies. A rebellion by the large-scale Jewish National Movement supported by 600,000 Jews in Palestine is quite possible.</p>
<p>The British are now assessing the balance of power between Jews and Muslims.</p>
<p>Jews threaten to take immediate action against the British. Five divisions of British troops, totaling 80,000 men, have failed to prevent attacks by extremists, although the organization of these extremists has less than 5,000 members. Now, the main Jewish underground forces are preparing to engage in combat with 65,000 trained personnel, some of whom have already begun sabotage activities. On one night, 151 sections of the Palestine Railway were bombed, and on another occasion, eight railway and highway bridges were destroyed simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from the London correspondent of "World Report" weekly, British officials believe that the Jews in Palestine can mobilize 100,000 people, including 24,500 local police officers and 25,000 demobilized soldiers who participated in the Libyan, Syrian, Greek, and Italian campaigns of World War II. Weapons and officers are available.</p>
<p>Arabs in Palestine do not have such training, equipment, or organization. However, if the 1.1 million Arabs in the Holy Land go on strike, as they did during the rebellion from 1936 to 1939, they could paralyze the entire country. Many Arabs possess weapons. It is recalled that in 1938, Arabs carried out 5,708 sabotage incidents, and they are now likely to copy the previous methods.</p>
<p>British Garrison</p>
<p>The assistance provided by the seven countries of the Arab League to the Palestinian Arabs will generally be greater than what they received during their pre-war rebellion. This will include money, weapons, and clandestine non-regular troops crossing the border.</p>
<p>The British troops stationed in the Middle East amount to 250,000, with 100,000 stationed in Egypt, one division stationed in Iraq, and other troops stationed in Cyprus, Greece, Libya, and the Red Sea area. However, troops and suppression measures cannot destroy a resistance movement supported by a large number of people, as the Nazi Party had already learned in Europe.</p>
<p>Arab and Jewish rebellions cannot drive the British out of the Middle East, but they can hinder the demobilization of British troops, cut off the supply of oil, and prevent Britain from establishing a new base in Palestine to transfer the troops stationed in Egypt and the Suez Canal area there.</p>
<p>Involving the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Britain feels that once Jewish and Muslim conflicts and rebellions officially occur, restraining British forces in the Middle East, Soviet pressure will inevitably take advantage of the situation. The Soviet troops stationed in the Balkans number one million, and they may take action towards the Middle East at any time to force Turkey and Iran to concede. At the same time, the Soviet Union may also provide propaganda and economic assistance to the Arab rebellion.</p>
<p>Britain hopes to divide Palestine to seek a political solution. However, the Arabs oppose division, and the Jews insist on establishing a Jewish state in Palestine.</p>
<p>Since compromise is impossible, Britain has been forced to favor either the Arabs or the Jews. When making the final decision, the first thing Britain needs to consider is which side is weaker and which is stronger.</p>
<p>Based on the above description, this question is indeed a difficult one.</p>
<h3>The Young and Vigorous Cabinet of the British Labour Party Tries to Prevent the Conservative Party From Making a Comeback</h3>
<p>— Xu Yuwei</p>
<p>Recently, British Prime Minister Attlee announced a partial reshuffle of the cabinet. In addition to creating the Ministry of Defence and appointing Naval Minister Alexander as the first Defence Minister, the personnel of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Civil Aviation, and Colonial ministries have also been greatly changed. State Secretary Noel-Baker has been appointed Air Minister, and Foreign Office Undersecretary MacNeil has been promoted to State Secretary. Noel-Baker and MacNeil have always been regarded as young and vigorous figures in the Labour government. This time, the former has been transferred to an important position, and the latter has been promoted to a cabinet member, which shows that the Labour cabinet is now striving to promote new figures and generate new forces. In this way, it can deal with the Conservative Party at home, which has great potential and is trying to make a comeback, and deal with the difficult issues of world diplomacy, military affairs, etc., in the age of atomic power abroad. Political observers in London believe that one of the motives for the British cabinet's reshuffle this time is to recruit young and vigorous figures into the cabinet, and MacNeil's promotion is one example. Noel-Baker and MacNeil have represented Britain at international conferences many times. Based on the materials published in British newspapers, a brief description of their lives is as follows:</p>
<p>Air Minister Noel-Baker</p>
<p>Noel-Baker was born in 1889. One of the characteristics of Noel's family is that they believe in the doctrines of the Religious Society of Friends (Quaker) and are members of the Society of Friends. The Society of Friends is a branch of Christianity that advocates peace and non-participation in war. This extreme pacifist doctrine has had a profound impact on Noel's current dedication to international peace work.</p>
<p>Noel was not only a good student with excellent character and learning but also an eloquent debater and a brave athlete. In the 1911 British-American University Games, Noel won the one-mile race. Since then, he has twice served as the captain of the British team participating in the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>During World War I, Noel did not enlist. After the war, Noel began to enter politics. He served as a secretary in the League of Nations section of the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. Since then, most of Noel's political career has been in diplomacy, continuing to work tirelessly for the sacred cause of international peace! When the Labour Party came to power in 1929, Noel was elected as a member of the House of Commons, representing the Labour Party, and served as the private secretary to Foreign Secretary Henderson. Later, in 1936, Noel served as a representative of the British delegation to the League of Nations General Assembly. At that time, Noel had become a handsome and elegant young diplomat, actively participating in the international diplomatic arena as a protagonist. In the spring of 1937, Noel solemnly warned the British government and people that Germany was preparing for war, and Britain would regret it if it did not catch up quickly!</p>
<p>In the first two years of this war, Noel worked in the Ministry of Information. His main task was to broadcast in various languages to the people in the occupied areas of Europe, reporting to them the truth about the war situation and enhancing their confidence in the final victory. With a figure known for his eloquence to take on this task, the completeness of the results and the magnificence of the effect were both inevitable and natural. In January 1942, the government headquarters promoted Noel to Undersecretary of the Ministry of War Transport. This was the beginning of Noel's joining the cabinet to participate in major planning.</p>
<p>After the end of World War II, Noel served as State Secretary in the Labour cabinet, which won a great victory in the general election. This was his first official appointment as a cabinet member. The main work that Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin gave him was to represent Britain at various international conferences, especially international conferences convened by the United Nations organizations that had economic and social characteristics. As for those political and diplomatic conferences that were complex in nature and subtle in relations, such as the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the Paris Peace Conference, Foreign Secretary Bevin personally attended. When the first session of the United Nations General Assembly was held in January of this year, Noel was one of the five representatives of Britain. He was also the representative of Britain to the Economic and Social Council and the Relief and Rehabilitation Council, and he also participated in the opening ceremony of the World Food and Agriculture Conference. In addition, Noel also served as the chairman of the European Emergency Economic Committee, the chairman of the European Food and Agriculture Conference, and the chairman of the Central European Inland Transport Organization.</p>
<p>State Secretary MacNeil</p>
<p>MacNeil is a Scot. When he was studying at the university, his talent for handling affairs and his fluent eloquence were appreciated by local people. He was once elected as a member of the Glasgow City Council. MacNeil also traveled to South Africa as a representative of the Imperial Parliamentary Delegation. Traveling to the Americas and Africa in his youth increased his knowledge and benefited him a lot. After graduating from school, MacNeil engaged in journalism, working for the "Scottish Daily Express." His articles were insightful and he was a successful journalist.</p>
<p>In 1941, MacNeil was elected as a member of the House of Commons. Later, when Noel served as Undersecretary of the Ministry of War Transport, MacNeil also entered the Ministry of War Transport, serving as Noel's private secretary. The two had a very harmonious personal relationship, and they also had the same views on national affairs. After the partial reorganization of the Labour cabinet this time, MacNeil succeeded Noel as State Secretary, "following the old rules," which shows the close relationship between the two.</p>
<p>After the Labour Party came to power last summer, MacNeil was appointed as Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, assisting Foreign Secretary Bevin, and was highly trusted by the latter, who regarded him as his right-hand man. In November, MacNeil was ordered to go to Athens, Greece, to investigate the complicated situation there. After returning to China, he provided many reasonable opinions, which were even more valued by the authorities, and everyone regarded him as the successor to the Foreign Secretary. This promotion to State Secretary is a preparatory step for taking office as Foreign Secretary in the future.</p>
<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>No Change in US Diplomacy After Republican Victory</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>The world events of the past week that are worth noting are the following three: (1) In the US congressional elections, the Republican Party, which has been in opposition for 14 years, suddenly won a victory, which will not only control the 40th US Congress, but also have great hope for the 1948 presidential election. (2) The sudden turn of events in the Chinese political situation, with President Chiang suddenly issuing an order to stop the conflict, has almost become "big news" in newspapers around the world, all using large characters for headlines and publishing them in prominent places. (3) The Trusteeship Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed the trusteeship issue, but no result was discussed due to the divergence of opinions between the United States and the Soviet Union. The fact that the United States insisted on managing the islands in the Pacific that were previously mandated by Japan is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>No Change in Diplomacy After the US General Election</p>
<p>The US Congress held a general election on the 5th of this month. As a result of the vote count, the Republican Party, which has been in opposition for 14 years, was able to overwhelm the Democratic Party and win a victory. Although it was within our expectations, its significance is very significant and cannot be ignored by any country. President Truman still has two full years before his term expires, and after the opening of the 40th Congress, the House and Senate will be controlled by the Republican Party. Therefore, all actions of President Truman, whether in domestic or foreign affairs, will inevitably be subject to congressional constraints. Especially in domestic affairs, the Republican Party has long been dissatisfied with Truman's domestic policy. Once the 40th Congress opens, it will inevitably weaken the wartime powers previously exercised by the Truman government. As former President Hoover said, "In recent years, the entire world, including the United States, has been moving to the left on the path of planned economic omnipotence; but now the United States, after this general election, will be the first country to abandon this path."</p>
<p>However, in terms of diplomacy, the Republican victory has no major impact. This is because the diplomatic policies adopted by Secretary of State Byrnes are greatly influenced by Republican foreign policy spokesman Vandenberg. Whether the United States attends any international conference, Vandenberg is always present. Austin, the chief representative of the United States to the United Nations organizations, is also an important figure in the Republican Party. According to Vandenberg's speech at Lake Success on the 8th, "No matter what the political system in Washington is, the United States will continue to fully support the United Nations. The United States government is bound to cooperate faithfully with all countries in the world, so that the United Nations organization can achieve peace and justice."</p>
<p>The Trusteeship Issue is Still Difficult to Resolve</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly began discussing the trusteeship issue on the 4th of this month. However, the United Nations Charter does not have clear and practical provisions for the trusteeship system. Therefore, the interpretation of the so-called "directly related countries" varies among the representatives of various countries. The United States has submitted to the Security Council a draft trusteeship agreement for the islands in the Pacific that were previously mandated by Japan. Although it advocates transferring all the islands to the United Nations for trusteeship, the United States still retains its management rights. The United States clearly wants to establish military bases on these islands, which will inevitably arouse the suspicion of various countries towards the United States. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether the draft submitted by the United States will be adopted by the Trusteeship Committee. Needless to say, the Soviet Union will inevitably express its dissent. The United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand will also not express their approval.</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly will continue to discuss this trusteeship issue next week, and I am afraid that there will be several more verbal battles.</p>
<p>Left Wing Gained Power in French General Election</p>
<p>France held a general election on the 10th of this month to elect members of the Fourth Republic National Assembly. According to the results of the vote count, the Communist Party has gained an advantage, obtaining 2,800,094 votes, accounting for 29% of the total votes. It is followed by the People's Republican Party, which obtained 2,270,000 votes. If the Republican victory in the United States is a symbol of the rightward turn of American politics, then the victory of the Republican Party in France can be said to be the beginning of the leftward turn of French politics. Therefore, the results of the general elections in the United States and France are an excellent contrast in the current international situation. Which path will the world take in the future? It is now at a crossroads. Moreover, the shadow of the post-war recession has also begun to be cast on countries around the world. (November 12th).</p>

<h3>Sakhalin Island</h3>
<p>— Zuo Qi</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow on October 25th: 18,000 Soviet citizens have arrived at various ports in southern Sakhalin Island in the past few months to work in newly built collective farms and factories. In addition, a United Press dispatch from Moscow on November 3rd reported: The Soviet authorities published a report on the first year of the new five-year plan. 14 coal mines have been developed in southern Sakhalin Island, and 45 food agencies have been established.</p>
<p>Sakhalin Island, known as Karafuto in Japanese and Sakhalin in Russian, was originally Chinese territory but was later invaded and occupied by Japan and Russia. Russia exchanged the Kuril Islands with Japan, and the entire island was assigned to Russian territory. After the Russo-Japanese War, Russia was defeated and ceded the area south of 50 degrees north latitude to Japan. At the end of World War III, the Soviet Union officially fought against Japan. When Japan surrendered unconditionally, the Soviet Union re-entered its territory in accordance with the Yalta Agreement.</p>
<p>Sakhalin Island is located directly north of Hokkaido and is separated from Siberia by the Tatar Strait. The island is rich in forests, coal mines, and aquatic products.</p>
<h3>Polish Representative to the United Nations, Dr. Lange … Maintains an Independent Attitude … Often Opposes the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Translated by Nan from the "Chamche Lihgao" Weekly</p>
<p>Polish Ambassador to the United States and Representative to the United Nations, Lange</p>
<p>Polish Representative to the United Nations, Lange, is a rather noteworthy figure. He is a socialist, representing a government led by the Communist Party, and was previously a US citizen, and is now speaking on behalf of a country within the Soviet sphere of influence.</p>
<p>Lange has always been one of the most cheerful of the many representatives at the United Nations, but since August 17th, when he took over as President of the Security Council, he has often appeared serious and tired. His decisions have sometimes been fiercely criticized by representatives of Western countries, and at other times have incurred the displeasure of Soviet representatives.</p>
<p>Observers believe that Lange has received strict orders from the Warsaw government not to oppose the Soviet Union on important issues. However, when discussing world issues, he often takes quite different views and positions from Gromyko, although he ultimately supports the Soviet Union on important issues.</p>
<p>His attitude towards Gromyko is not entirely consistent. For example, Lange, regardless of Soviet opposition, supported Ireland's accession to the United Nations. When the Security Council discussed the issue of Iran, he did not agree with the Soviet proposal to remove the issue from the agenda, and when Gromyko angrily withdrew from the Security Council meeting, he remained in his seat.</p>
<p>Advocates Creating Understanding and Maintaining a Friendly Attitude</p>
<p>This scholarly diplomat advocates creating understanding between the major powers and hopes to maintain friendly relations with both the Soviet Union, Poland's closest neighbor, and the Western countries.</p>
<p>The occasional inconsistencies between Lange and Gromyko have led to various rumors that Warsaw will force him to resign, but he denies these rumors. Currently, Lange is the representative of Poland to the United Nations and also the Ambassador to the United States, but in the near future, he is likely to give up the position of Ambassador and concentrate on the work of the United Nations. Lange's past experience is quite unique. Since 1934, he has lived almost continuously in the United States and has studied and taught at seven American universities. Finally, in 1943, he obtained US citizenship. Two years later, he was invited to serve as Ambassador to the United States for his political advocacy of Polish-Soviet friendship. He returned to Warsaw, gave up his US citizenship, and became a Polish citizen again. However, his wife, who is originally from Ireland, and his seven-year-old son are still US citizens. Lange himself is still a professor at the University of Chicago, now only on leave.</p>
<p>An Economist Developed Political Interests</p>
<p>Lange is an economist who developed an interest in politics during the war, publishing many articles and speeches on the conflict between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile in London. He believes that the government-in-exile is controlled by reactionary elements and urged free elements to break away from it and join the Union of Polish Patriots supported by Moscow. This proposal was accepted by the three powers at the Yalta Conference in 1945.</p>
<p>At the same time, at the invitation of the Poles, he made a six-week trip to the Soviet Union. In May 1944, Stalin personally received him and talked for 140 minutes. Afterwards, Lange said that he believed that Stalin wanted a strong Poland, "without forcing new Poland to conform to the Soviet Union and to determine its political, economic, or social form."</p>
<p>Informal Talks are Popular with Reporters</p>
<p>This Polish diplomat is five feet three inches tall and weighs 176 pounds. News reporters like him very much because he is informal and very willing to chat casually with reporters, and they can often get excellent explanations of Soviet actions from him.</p>
<p>Lange's greatest hope is to bridge the gap between the Soviet Union and the Western countries. Poland is between East and West, and this policy is of course most beneficial to her. Lange, who was originally a US citizen and is also a Soviet economist, is certainly very suitable for this job. But for a diplomat of a small country, this job is really too difficult. Now that his month-long term as President of the Security Council has expired, perhaps he can feel a little relaxed.</p>

<h3>A Eulogy for Guan Liang's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yingpeng</p>
<p>Since the start of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Guan Liang moved to the rear, taking on a teaching position at the National Art Academy, and has recently returned east with the school. During these eight years, he consistently immersed himself in painting, striving tirelessly. His skill has progressed from purely Western styles to the creation of a new national art. Looking at his achievements, one feels as if "the fortifications have been completely renewed, and the banners have changed color." I deeply admire that he did not waste his time during these eight years.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago, when Mr. Guan first returned from Japan, he collaborated with Mr. Chen Baoyi and Mr. Xu Jiaogu to hold an art exhibition. He initially brought the Western Impressionist style, which strongly stimulated the emerging art movement. Due to their honest attitude towards creation and solid foundation, scholars unanimously admired them, believing that real skill is by no means comparable to those who superficially imitate, decorate appearances, and deceive the world for fame. Mr. Guan and others' initial contributions to art, apart from those in the art circle, received little attention from other areas. Honest artists only have the spirit of immersing themselves in research, and no habit of presumptuous arrogance. Therefore, the deeper their learning, the more lonely their lives. Unreasonable phenomena are always and everywhere, especially in Chinese society, which is most difficult to explain.</p>
<p>The rise of nationalism in the new literature and art once stirred up a wave, though not a raging tide, but to this day, it has gradually been recognized as the primary truth in both tangible and intangible ways. Initially, this was only the result of a few like-minded people exploring each other, gaining a central understanding, and when their views converged, they could not help but put it forward as a call. The reason we need nationalistic literature and art is not stubborn restoration of the old ways, but rather to awaken the natural existence based on national consciousness and the local customs and sentiments of national history, while also absorbing Western culture as new blood to restore the nation's youthful life. At the time, it was also deeply felt that after the May Fourth Movement, scholars and the general youth, although understanding that the declining old Chinese culture was insufficient to meet the trends of the times, inevitably reversed the roles and forgot the nation's standpoint in the liberation of thought. This weakness was exploited by ambitious countries, even to the point of a political crisis of "calling another's father." During the period of conflicting opinions, the like-minded people inevitably suffered some attacks, which was expected. However, everyone had considerable self-confidence and did not care about anything, especially the few colleagues engaged in fine arts, who simply kept silent and continued their research. Mr. Guan Liang is one of them.</p>
<p>In his recent works, in addition to Western painting, he has also moved on to create new traditional Chinese paintings.</p>
<p>His traditional Chinese paintings specifically use ink to express impressions of various figures, especially local dramas, which can be called "ink paintings." Originally, the Western Impressionist school arose under the influence of Eastern painting. There is a consistent thread in it. And Mr. Guan's paintings not only purely take local customs, but the divine changes of ink are both subtle and free, with a deep and lasting charm, especially reaching the highest level of traditional Chinese painting. The figures depicted are only a few strokes, but the humor and expression jump onto the paper. One can imagine the author's keenness of feeling and the vivacity of spirit. Sometimes the brushstrokes are as light as wandering silk, sometimes as vigorous as soaring dragons, both ethereal and grounded. There is not much coloring, but the simpler it is, the more stimulating it becomes. He often uses simple vermilion, yellow, cyan, emerald, and light red colors, combined with ink, which feels especially cold and beautiful. Although each painting contains the advantages of the Western post-Impressionist school, it is different from the faces of Cézanne, Gauguin, and Matisse. If such ink figures are appreciated with the narrow boundaries of ordinary traditional Chinese painting, I am afraid it will not stop there. Originally, artistic creation must be something that predecessors did not have, and ordinary people naturally cannot get used to it, so they are unwilling to taste it. But true skill has been tempered many times, and it is not a matter of one morning or one evening. The bitterness and sweetness in this cannot be pretended by those who deliberately make strange things to seek fame and reputation. Luo Liangfeng liked to make ghost interest pictures to satirize connoisseurs, which inevitably hurt sincerity, but for the author, it is not necessarily a kind of criticism.</p>
<p>His Western paintings are mostly landscape sketches. In recent years, he has traveled to Sichuan, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guizhou provinces, not hesitating to face difficulties, and has sketched historical sites and famous scenic spots in various places. The inspiration of nature and the response of history have opened up his artistic field. Although he only uses watercolor due to the lack of oil painting materials, the composition and layout are exclusively for great rivers, towering mountains, dangerous peaks and flying waterfalls, which are purely the style of traditional Chinese landscape painting. Although the paintings are small, they have a lofty and magnificent view. The brushstrokes are bold, free, elegant and outstanding, just like the painting methods of famous painters of the Jin and Tang dynasties, especially the trees, which are super wonderful. This is very different from the brushwork of figure paintings. The colors are delicate and refined, the atmosphere is complete, and the bones and appearance are clear. If you observe with the eyes of traditional Chinese painting, there is not a single one that is not the most wonderful landscape painting. The ease with which he handles it can directly win the seat of Wu Mojing. In Western landscape paintings, there is certainly no such sentiment. In this way, it can be called a watercolor painting with national spirit. Mr. Guan has never made traditional Chinese landscape paintings, but because of his deep skills in Western painting, he can meet the essence of the principles of traditional Chinese landscape painting without expecting it, and he can pass through it with one stroke, and have the joy of being able to do everything with ease. If it is like the so-called eclectic school in Japan, it cannot avoid artificiality and crude imitation, and it is absolutely impossible to compare. When Mr. Guan was in Sichuan, several traditional Chinese painters saw his landscapes, and the composition was strange and shocking, and they could not help but ask to borrow a copy to keep it as a painting draft. The situation of traditional Chinese painters is like this, which proves that Mr. Guan's works contain a very strong Chinese flavor.</p>
<p>I have been separated from Mr. Guan for several years. After meeting, I admire his skill and progress, and I also recall the journey we shared in the new art movement. It is truly emotional to look back and forth. Mr. Guan will hold a solo exhibition recently, so I especially record a few words, and I hope that those with true vision will not consider it a biased view.</p>

<h3>Psychological Description in Literary Creation</h3>
<p>— Shen Xianyuan</p>
<p>In a successful literary work, the author must go through the three processes of observation, experience, and feeling. Therefore, in addition to the expression of images, psychological description cannot be lacking. When a literary writer begins to create, he should not ignore the psychological life of people, just as he does not ignore the description of people's actions. At the very least, it should be used as an auxiliary technique for realistic description, because the so-called "person" not only lives an animalistic life, but is also a social existence. When he lives in a certain specific society, he not only needs material satisfaction, but also has his own desires, emotions, thoughts, and psychological responses. Temporarily speaking, human life has both its internal and external aspects, and these internal and external aspects are unified in the whole personality of the person and expressed externally.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a kind of writer who, when choosing a theme, specializes in exploring the strange states of mind of individuals and psychological reactions, such as madness, idiocy, and erotic mania, etc., and makes deep excavations of the original instincts and feelings of mankind; and dissects the hidden and abnormal side of human life deeply without concealment. In the usual situation, these writers' works express the strange psychological phenomena of mankind. This special preference for creation methods can only be used as a source of appreciation and recreation for those who have the same preferences. In China, in the past, some people advocated psychologicalism in literature and wanted to use it as a call to form a trend. In fact, this is very undesirable. A correct understanding of people certainly not only requires knowing his appearance, but also going a step further to know his inner heart; but if you do not understand the situation, you can only get an external understanding of people. People exist in society. For creation, like everything that human beings do, the importance of individuality cannot be ignored, but individuality is always social individuality, and its growth and occurrence have its social roots. If a writer only pays attention to the psychological exploration of the characters in his works and despises his external environment, or even ignores the physiological basis of the psychological phenomena that are revealed through action, and does not pay attention to the organic and complex relationship between the two and the social reasons for the existence of the characters' psychology, then he will only make the content of the work conceptualized and fall into the tendency of abstract psychologicalism; at the same time, the psychological activities of the characters in the work will only become a vacuum, a subjective fabrication of the author.</p>
<p>In the new creation method, just as action description is valued, the importance of human psychological description is not ignored either. But it has already transcended the individual-centered point of view and further noticed the expression of the psychology of the masses. When they make psychological descriptions of characters, they not only do not forget the social existence of people, in most cases, people's psychological reactions are always expressed through action; they pay more attention to the process of human psychological construction, and human psychological phenomena are not fixed, but always show diversity due to changes in time and changes in circumstances.</p>
<p>However, there is still something that should be paid attention to in the process of expressing the constitution of human psychology, that is, it must be accompanied by the development of action, and the psychological activity of people must be regarded as coming from and subordinate to the development of their action. That is, to suggest the truth of his psychology to the reader from some of the protagonist's behaviors and actions.</p>
<p>However, some writers, when they engage in psychological descriptions of characters in their works, mostly use lengthy psychological monologues by the protagonists in their works, or use dialogue-style philosophical debates, but this kind of creation method has become a thing of the past. Literary works are most taboo to accommodate philosophical speculations, and psychological monologues are too lengthy and can easily make people feel bored, so I think this kind of creation method should also be paid attention to.</p>
<h3>Fuchun Teahouse—A Yangzhou Sequel, Part Five</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>When you want to eat refreshments in Yangzhou, you should never forget the Fuchun Teahouse. In the eyes of the people of Yangzhou, Fuchun not only has good refreshments and good tea, but also clean tables. The tea is brewed with a mixture of Longjing, Zhulan, and Kuizhen tea leaves, with Longjing for its color, Zhulan for its fragrance, and Kuizhen for its taste. If a cup of tea can have both color, aroma, and taste, isn't that enough to be praised? As for the tables, those in ordinary teahouses are greasy, but at Fuchun, the customers can rest assured. Even if the white sleeves are pressed on the table for a long time, they will not be stained. Because every table there is scraped and polished every day.</p>
<p>Inside this Fuchun, there are some rooms that had certain names in the past. Although there were no plaques or the like to mark them clearly, they were generally recognized, such as the place where the elders of the village met. The rooms were relatively short, so the light was relatively poor. Most people didn't want to go in, and they didn't want others to go in, because that would disturb the elegant atmosphere of chanting poems and playing chess. The Great Achievement Hall was because a man named Jiang regularly drank tea there. In the past, his father was both virtuous and learned, and people called him a saint. The son of a saint is undoubtedly a little saint. The place where the little saint sits is called the Great Achievement Hall. Why not call it Sheng Gong Mansion, which seems more interesting and accurate, is unknown. As for the Buliaoliaozhai (So-So Studio), that was because several retired people used to drink tea there. They had no social status and were not well-off in life. They held a "so-so" attitude towards everything, so this place became the So-So Studio. In addition, there is the so-called Education Bureau, which is the gathering place for people in the education sector, and the Land Temple, which is too small in area and resembles a land temple. All of these seem to be less interesting than the naming of the above three places.</p>
<p>However, these three places have been distinctly different in recent years. The village elders in the Elders' Hall have gradually metabolized and gradually become scarce. The tea drinkers there seem to have changed to a group of people who hate noise and avoid trouble, who only want to forget the bustling reality in these relatively dark places. There is no longer the elegance of the past. As for the Great Achievement Hall and the So-So Studio, after the changes of the times, people of all colors are complete. The Little Saint is making a living in all directions and cannot often go to the Great Achievement Hall, and some tea drinkers who have retired and dispersed have already risen and fallen differently and can no longer reunite at the So-So Studio. In addition, the teahouse owner Chen Buyun has recently stopped being responsible and has handed over the business of the teahouse to the original tea workers to run together. Therefore, there is one less person who has a face full of spring breeze and enthusiastic hospitality. This makes the older tea drinkers inevitably feel the vicissitudes of life.</p>
<p>However, the Fuchun Teahouse was originally just a flower shop, and it only became a teahouse in the early years of the Republic of China. Before it became a teahouse, it was just a place for some old seniors to sit. All the tea sets and so on were prepared by themselves. They drank tea, chanted poems, played chess, and painted in the flowers every day. When they needed refreshments, they always bought them from elsewhere. It is said that sometimes they even flew cups and enjoyed the moon there. At that time, they named it the Borrowing Group. Later, it was probably because the number of people gradually increased, and it was inconvenient to deal with, so the small owner of the flower shop, Chen Buyun mentioned earlier, officially opened the teahouse. And those old seniors all retreated to the inside of the Elders' Hall for a while. Because they have a deep relationship with this place, they will be treated preferentially in some respects. For example, if you go to brew a pot of tea early in the morning, you can leave half of the tea leaves and come back to brew it again in the afternoon, and only pay for one pot of tea, which is a right that others cannot enjoy. Now that the old are dying, this situation no longer exists. Therefore, if we talk about the current Fuchun Teahouse from the past Borrowing Group, the so-called sense of vicissitudes will be extraordinarily increased.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood - 91</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>After the "tuk tuk" sounded twice, lasting only half a second, suddenly a very loud, loudspeaker-like, piercing voice shouted, "Ah er…!" Followed by gibberish, speaking in Japanese, as if announcing something.</p>
<p>"Damn, Aunt!" Tiger whispered: "Maybe the Japs are calling that mastiff, right?"</p>
<p>I had no time to answer Tiger's question, only to give an order like, "Quick, find a large bolt cutter in the truck, and bite open a hole in each of the bottom row of those gasoline barrels... Quick!"</p>
<p>It was almost nine o'clock at this time. Tiger went to look around among the rows of trucks, and suddenly found a foot-long bolt cutter in a truck. He ran to the mountain of gasoline barrels, and used the cutter to bite the curled edge of the bottom row, one by one, prying and twisting, forming a small opening. Tiger was quite strong and dexterous, and doing this work was like a seasoned professional, and without a sound. These oil drums were probably five rows deep, each row about forty large round oil drums; each layer was stacked on top of each other, about eight or nine layers high, totaling nearly two thousand barrels.</p>
<p>While Tiger was prying the oil drums, I was busy straightening the gasoline pump pipe of the oil pool, smoothing it on the ground, with the pipe head facing the gasoline drums. There were a total of twenty-four air pressure pumps here. One by one, I released the upper and lower valves, and the other task was to turn the crank handle, so the oil flowed out in large streams, like opening a tap. When Tiger had pried open dozens of gasoline barrels, I had only cranked the third one here. However, the concrete ground of more than ten zhang in circumference had been flooded with gasoline, and the rest was spreading under the oil drums like lake water. Tiger stepped through the gasoline and came over. Seeing me cranking, he didn't wait for me to instruct him, and ran to the last pump at the south end and started cranking it.</p>
<p>We cranked the pumps for only a while, and the announcer's broadcast had already stopped. Fortunately, these oil pipes were all laid flat on the ground, and the oil flowed out from the pipes, making only a faint sound of running water, which could not be heard beyond ten yards. So we could work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>After about twenty minutes or so, we only pumped seven or eight oil pools dry. The released gasoline was already more than enough to start a big fire. I suddenly thought that the work of setting fire also required a considerable amount of time to arrange, so I ran to Tiger and quietly told him to continue working, and I would arrange the things for setting fire. Tiger smiled when he heard this, and said, "Why bother with such a big deal? Just run a considerable distance before leaving and fire a shot or two, won't that ignite it?" I told him that we couldn't do that. If a gunshot rang out, the Japs would know the direction of our actions.</p>
<p>Of course, we are not incapable of doing what is done in the movies, releasing all the oil, grabbing a car, and just before leaving, firing a few shots to ignite the gasoline, and then driving straight out of the restricted area. How simple, neat and happy that would be. However, the goal of the film is to make the audience move their eyes. The screenwriter and director have neither personal experience nor knowledge of deep spy work, and they don't care whether the plot is reasonable or not, so they just do what they want.</p>

<h3>Minute</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Ji Kang said in his Treatise on Preserving Life:</p>
<p>"A mistake in conduct, perish in the small. Accumulate the small into loss, accumulate loss into decay. From decay comes whiteness, from whiteness comes old age. From old age comes the end, vexed as if without cause. Looking up and looking down, none is not so."</p>
<p>Preventing the small and stopping the gradual, in people's daily life and behavior, is indeed a major test and a difficult subject. The reason lies in the fact that "small" is not big, and "gradual" is not sudden. Mr. Ji is by no means exaggerating or alarmist. Not only is this true of people's physiology, but how is it not true of everything in society?</p>
<p>Queuing to wait for a bus or buy a ticket, this seems to be a small matter. Because it is a detail, people often ignore it. Therefore, it is very difficult to maintain order in many public places. On the other hand, if everyone respects the principle of first come, first served and gets on and off the bus or enters the place in an orderly manner, it will not only avoid many unnecessary accidents, but also maintain public order and make everyone's spirit of abiding by the law particularly solid. We really cannot estimate its influence in nature.</p>
<p>Queuing to wait for a bus is just one example. Those traitors who are now subject to the sanctions of national law, are they not all extremely intelligent people? It is only because of a single mistake in the beginning that they gradually sank and could not extricate themselves, which is why they are in the situation they are in today.</p>
<p>News Reference Material</p>
<h3>Two Examples</h3>
<p>— Mai Ye</p>
<p>After reading the two Central News Agency dispatches on the newspaper of October 30th, I became more and more confused. I do not misunderstand what the dispatches speak of, however, I can only understand an "approximation" or a "ballpark estimate!"</p>
<p>The first is the Canton dispatch on the 29th from this news agency, which said that the Yuehan Line light railway vehicle traffic was open, "the loading capacity of each vehicle could be increased to 190 tons, at a speed of 29 kilometers per hour, and each gallon of gasoline could travel five miles." The description of the event is very clear; what is not very clear is the lack of uniformity in "units" and "units."</p>
<p>"Tons," may I ask, what kind of "tons" are they? If this telegram was sent by "Agence France-Presse," we could infer that it is a "metric ton," i.e., one thousand kilograms. If it is a "Reuters" telegram, then it must be a "British ton" (also known as "large ton," i.e., long ton or gross ton), equal to two thousand two hundred and forty pounds. Also, if it is an "Associated Press of America" telegram, then it is of course a "US ton" (also known as "small ton," i.e., short ton or net ton), no doubt about it. Since it is said to be a vehicle, of course it is not the "ton" of a ship, but when talking about the load of cargo, some people also use "measurement ton" (equal to one hundred cubic feet). And what I see in the Central News Agency's "tons," I can only understand "approximately!"</p>
<p>"Speed of 29 kilometers per hour" while the gasoline consumption rate is "five miles" per gallon. Couldn't they convert "five miles" into "eight kilometers" to make it easier for people to understand? Once the units are unified, readers can easily understand that the car can travel for an hour with only about three and a half gallons of fuel.</p>
<p>The second telegram is from Shenyang, saying that there is a surplus of soybeans in the Northeast, and the local production management bureau is using soybeans to manufacture wool in Shenyang, "It is said that the elasticity and luster of the wool made from soybeans are no different from wool."</p>
<p>May I ask: is there a problem with the wording of "wool made from soybeans"?</p>
<p>If we say there isn't, then can we say, by analogy, "silkworms made from wood," "kapok made from paper," "nylon made from coal," ...?</p>
<p>Forcing ourselves to say "yes," it is still very difficult to understand. Because what is manufactured from wood and wood pulp is just "rayon" that resembles natural silk, and what is manufactured from paper pulp is just "staple fiber" that resembles cotton. (According to research, before World War II, both Germany and Japan manufactured large quantities of it to save the lack of cotton sources. The Japanese abbreviated it as Su-fu, and it seems that there was no word "artificial cotton.") And "nylon" is just an organic chemical synthetic fiber of carbon, which is neither natural silk nor "glass!" There are many kinds of "artificial fibers" similar to this!</p>
<p>"Casein" in milk can also be extracted into fiber for spinning, and so can soybeans. The fiber obtained from soybeans, of course, also falls into the category of "artificial fiber," but because the fiber used in spinning is not as long as the fiber of "rayon," it is also called "artificial short fiber." Natural wool is shorter than natural silk fiber and natural cotton fiber in spinning, so "artificial short fiber" can also be sloppily called "artificial wool," but the word "artificial" is indispensable!</p>
<p>A man and a woman have a baby after marriage, "what's so special." If one day, scientists can really "manufacture" a little girl from a liter of rice and two bushels of wheat, I believe that no matter how much she looks like, she must wear an "artificial" (rather than human-raised) hat. Otherwise, what will become of it?</p>
<p>I don't want to nitpick. I hope that the news staff of large news agencies and newspapers can "divide the labor" and "specialize." Doesn't foreign countries have "science reporters" and "science editors"? Secondly, I hope that all units of measurement on the newspaper are unified, and do not have li, kilometers, city li, nautical miles, miles... all active on the page at the same time! Do you think that an army that advances ten miles but retreats fifteen kilometers has advanced or retreated?</p>
<h3>Heroic Men and Beautiful Women</h3>
<p>— Saintly Purity</p>
<p>·A Wonderful Tale from the Northeast Army·</p>
<p>I recently learned from a letter from a friend in the Northeast about many wonderful romances involving servicemen.</p>
<p>Since the two new armies (the New First Army and the New Sixth Army) that fought in India and Burma transferred to the Northeast, they have been welcomed everywhere by people from all walks of life.  The successive National Revolutionary Army troops were also warmly welcomed because they fought for eight years and shed much blood.  Naturally, today, the people of the Northeast view these National Revolutionary Army soldiers, especially those who fought in foreign lands, with extraordinary respect.</p>
<p>Most notably, many women have broken through the traditional mentality of "looking down on soldiers." On the contrary, beautiful young ladies, young girls, and even Japanese women are all very eager to approach the warriors.</p>
<p>Today, the soldiers in the Northeast are mostly very neat and handsome, and exceptionally mighty, wearing clean and beautiful leather overcoats, woolen military uniforms, and leather riding boots.  Ordinary schoolgirls, especially those around twenty years old, are particularly envious of young officers. They feel that these young officers are handsome, young heroes on horseback.  Therefore, many officers who could not afford to marry during the war now have beautiful wives. In the three cities of Shenyang, Changchun, and Jinzhou, weddings are held almost every other day, and the attendees are all servicemen.</p>
<p>The soldiers are a little poorer than the officers and do not know how to dance, so their targets are mostly Japanese women. They can find temporary comfort from the Japanese waitresses in those cafes for very little money.</p>
<p>In the interior, soldiers are not only not welcomed by others, but are also often viewed with discriminatory eyes. Women are even less likely to be respectful. The typical person who looks down on soldiers forbids them from dancing at dance halls.  But in the Northeast, it is the opposite, which is enviable. We believe that in this post-victory era, it is not surprising that there are many wonderful stories involving servicemen.  We cannot say that "servicemen cannot fall in love." However, as long as there is some restraint in the atmosphere of freedom, and it is not too foreign, then it is acceptable. We hope that the warriors will handle romances with a normal attitude, and that the common people will also regard the military with a normal and natural attitude.</p>
<p>Intelligence Test</p>
<h3>Memory of Time</h3>
<p>— Yu Feng</p>
<p>Do you find yourself often late for the office or school? Perhaps you don't have a very accurate clock or watch, which is an important reason; but on the other hand, your memory of time is too weak, which is the main reason why you are late.</p>
<p>You may not believe it, but you can test yourself now. This test is the simplest and most accurate:</p>
<p>Look at a watch, write down the time you see in the most detail (the number of seconds should also be written), then hide or move the watch away. Start silently memorizing (estimating) the time that has passed since you looked at the watch (in seconds). After a few minutes, quickly write down the number of seconds you memorized, and then quickly look at the watch again. See if the elapsed time is similar to the time you memorized. If it is still close, then you know you are not likely to be late; if the number of seconds memorized exceeds the actual elapsed time by a lot, then you must be an early arrival, otherwise, you will easily be late.</p>
<p>A psychology expert has tested many of his students from time to time with this test. Often, when the watch shows 110 seconds have passed, many people only record that 60 seconds have passed, while others record that 200 seconds have passed, a difference of more than three times. And the students who recorded 60 seconds were found to be often late after investigation.</p>
<h3>Change in Weather</h3>
<p>— Li Sheng</p>
<p>I don't know why, but it's already mid-October in the lunar calendar, and it's still very hot. For a few days, you could almost wear a single shirt at noon, like the climate of early summer.</p>
<p>Because of the hot weather, the broad beans planted in the fields in the countryside already have very lush branches and leaves. If it continues to be this hot, they may bloom. A few days ago, it was reported that peach trees in a certain village in Changzhou blossomed in autumn, which is also due to the abnormal climate.</p>
<p>If it is not cold when it should be, there will be more epidemics. There have been many cases of diphtheria in these days. Yesterday, an old man next door was still working as a laborer during the day, but suddenly died this morning, said to be from "suffocation"; in short, if it snows this winter, the vegetables and wheat seedlings in the countryside will definitely be greatly damaged, but if it doesn't snow this winter, then the plagues next year will be even worse. Why does God want to make fun of us?</p>
<h3>The star of the new film "Between Men and Women": Diana Barrymore.</h3>
<p>The Story of a Psychoanalyst</p>
<h3>The Innocent Murderer</h3>
<p>— Xu Guiting</p>
<p>In America, the first book about psychoanalytic stories has been published recently, "The Innocent Murderer" by Nigel Balchin. It tells a shocking story about a psychoanalyst who tries to solve the "mystery of life" for a British veteran suffering from a nervous disorder, in order to cure his illness, and hopes to cure his mental illness before he commits murder. Unfortunately, the ending is an irretrievable tragedy: the patient shoots and injures his wife, almost beats the psychoanalyst as well, resulting in a complete uproar.  The police in London are racking their brains, and finally he reveals a past encounter that he cannot reveal, and then ends his own life with a pistol. The whole book is very long. "Reader's Digest" has shortened it into a story of ten pages, and the translator has further abridged it for the convenience of readers. This shocking psychological crime story unfolds like this:</p>
<p>The psychoanalyst, Meane, sat quietly in his chair, staring at the carpet. He was terribly tired and really hungry. So many people always asked him for help.</p>
<p>His wife, Polly, said to him: "There are too many people who want your help. Oh, Mrs. Leeson called to make an appointment to talk to you. I told her she could come here on Thursday afternoon. Is that okay?"</p>
<p>Meane replied: "Um, of course."</p>
<p>A few days later, Mrs. Leeson arrived as scheduled. She was very thin, with dark skin, and about twenty-five years old. She was very small.</p>
<p>When she came in, she acted quite flustered, but her attitude was still quite serious. Meane felt a little uncomfortable and forced a kind smile at her. She smiled slightly and shook hands with Meane.</p>
<p>Meane then asked, "What difficulties are you having?" She replied, "I don't have any difficulties. The one with the problem is my husband, Adam. He always wants to murder me."</p>
<p>"Um," Meane said, "Then he should see a doctor."</p>
<p>Mrs. Leeson frowned and said, "That's what he hates. He doesn't like seeing doctors. During the war, he saw many doctors, so he hates seeing doctors."</p>
<p>Meane nodded and said, "Then tell me what happened!"</p>
<p>"It happened like this: I am an American. I came to England to travel. In London, I met Adam, and later married him in early 1940."</p>
<p>"How old is he now?"</p>
<p>"He is twenty-eight years old. He was a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force. His combat record is very outstanding."</p>
<p>"Is your marriage happy?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, it is very happy. He was initially very enthusiastic about his life in aerial combat, but later became tired of it. He found a ground service job on the Asian battlefield. Later, I heard that he was missing. He was fighting over Rangoon when his plane caught fire and crashed with him. Almost a year later, he actually survived. According to him, he jumped out of the plane with a parachute and fell into a tree. After climbing down, he met a group of natives. They treated him very well, but unexpectedly sold him to the Japanese devils. The Japanese devils were afraid that he would escape, so they broke one of his legs, but he was still able to find an opportunity to kill a Japanese devil with a piece of wood, and then escaped back here."</p>
