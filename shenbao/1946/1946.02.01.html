<h3 id="c4">恢復鐵路交通問題　意見尙未能一致　限期完成修路困難甚多 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕停止衝突問題，不久似可告一段落，執行部目前之工作，已將重點置於恢復交通，但政府中共雙方意見，尚有頗大距離。政府主張全國鐵路統一管理，沿綫秩序由路警維持，共方則對路警之中立性，表示懷疑，主張分段管理，分段護路。截至目前，雙方意見尚無接近之跡象。除兗州方面已開始修路外，其他各綫出動之搶修隊，俱尚停留於工地，候雙方協議後，始得開工。此次修復鐵路，蔣主席曾限二月底完成，但因實際困難，不一而足，屆時能吾通車，尚成問題。目前最困難問題，爲缺乏枕本，因枕木多被拆去燒毀，短時期內由國外運來大批現成枕木旣不可能，在目前政府政令僅及於少數城地情形之下，亦無法由鄉間搜集，實屬困難已極，鐵軌雖需量達五〇〇公里，但多數並未銷燬，易於找回，再加以拆除不重要支綫鐵軌，尚可勉强應付·橋樑方面，平漢·津浦兩大橋俱未被毀，差堪慶幸。機車雖炸燬頗多，亦尚可勉强調配·人員方面，日人原來之野戰鐵道部隊六七千人，已於停戰令下後由戰區方面集中長辛店·石家莊·天津，分別繳械，目前人員頗感不敷用之吾。聞美國將派鐵路工程師三百人員來華，將來或可解決一部高級技術問題，交次凌鴻勛僕僕風　，對修復鐵路曾告人謂，我們至今尚未獲得國外一根鋼軌，一根枕木，修復舊路之艱難，實有過於造一條新路｀</p>

<p>〔中央社重慶卅一日電〕蔣主席卅一日在政治協商會議閉會時致調，全文如次：</p>
<p>諸位會員　政治協商會議開會以來，經過廿餘天，熱烈的討論，已經完成其應有的任務，今天宣告閉會了，本人以職務獨身，不能侮次都來和諸位交換意見，甚覺抱歉。回顧這廿餘大中問，諸位會員無論在分組會商或全體大會，都能開誠布公，大家本着互尊·互信·互助·合作的精神，實事求是的尋覓各種問題合理的解決，使本會議始終在祥和協調空氣之中，獲得圓滿的成就，尤爲本會議最可寳貴的收穫。本人虔誠希望，這種公忠坦白的精神，能够永遠保持下去，大家不爭怠氣，不重私見，只是一心爲着國家，爲着人民而共同協力，則本會議的一切決定，必可順利執行。今後無謂的政爭，必可澈底化除，和平建國的目的，必可迅速達成，對於未來憲政實施的前途，也必能因此而愈顯光明，這是今天閉會之頃，本人十分愈快的感想，應該特別提出來向諸位表示感謝。</p>
<p>當前唯一重要問題　確保統一建立民主</p>
<p>原來我們國民革命的目的，是在完成三民主義的建設，造成獨立自由統一的民主國家，尤其要團結奮鬥來達成和平建國的目的。至於國民革命的對象，對外是在排除帝國主義的侵略，對內是在打倒封建割據的勞力。以往推翻滿淸，掃蕩軍閥和此次八年抗戰，兢兢業業，堅苦奮鬥，惟一的目的，無非是求獨立，求統一，先除去民主的障礙，以完成民主制度的實現。到現在，掃除革命障礙，奠立民主基礎的工作，已經初步成功，我們當前唯一重要的問題，只是如何確保統一，如何建立民主，換句話說，也就是如何實現三民主義的問題。我們要知道，必須有確實的統一，纔有眞正的民主可言，我相信，我們國內，此後不會再有私有的武裝軍隊，分立的地方政權來妨礙政令與軍令的統一，吾則我論如何高唱民主，而事實上所表現出來的，必是各行其是的假民主，甚至完全是反民主的行動。這樣的假民主，永遠不能走上民主憲政的大道，而且永還要爲民主政治的障礙·因此，我們爲了要實現眞民主，眞統一起見，和平團結兩個條件，實在是我們當前最迫切的需要。</p>
<p>統一民主和平團結　四大原則奉爲信條</p>
<p>因國父臨終遺囑「和平奮鬥救中國」，我個人和中國國民黨的同志，始終是服膺這個崇高遺訓，除了對於割據的軍閱和侵略的日本不得不用武力對抗之外，其他對於國內一切問題，不論遭遇任何嚴重形勢，總是抱定忍讓爲國的決心，不惜委曲求全，尋求政治解決的送徑，縱使不得已而有軍事衝突，也只是被動的防衛，決不採取主動的行動。這因爲我們認定，我們的國力，民力，只可從安定中求保養，再禁不起任何戰禍的摧發，所以每在危機一髮之間，都能化乖戾爲祥和，並且任齟　的意見，也都能融和一致，恢復到和平團結。已往這種經過事例，尤其是抗戰以來八年間的事實，國人皆所共知，毋待贅述，這就是我們今日所主張的統一民主和平團結的精神所在。而這次政治協商會議，就是一本統一民主和平謝結的四大原則而進行，所以各種議案，都有可信可行的決定。我要坦白的說一句，這實在是我們中國五十年來，國民革命精神所孕育陶鑄者，勝利結果，足使飽經憂患痛苦而急須休養生息的全國同胞，然覺到無上安慰。希望我們大家要把這四大原則永遠奉爲我們的信條，永遠照着這個信條共同遵守，共同努力，纔可安慰爲革命抗戰而犧牲的軍民先烈，纔不致辜負全國人民的期望。</p>
<p>竭誠治商決定各案　政府即當分別實行</p>
<p>本會議開會之日，政府即頒布全國停止軍事衝突，恢復交通的命令，政府代表與中共代表並公布了一月五日所協議的辦法，同時公布了命令內容的金部與其附屬規定的四項條款，以示一致遵行的決心，本會議開會的第二天，政府代表與中共代表並向會議詳細報告，因此，本會議就能够專心政志，來研究關於和平建國與促進憲致的各種方案。本會議所決定的各項方案，本人雖然不能每次出席參加，但是時時刻刻都在注意和研究，覺得各項方案的內容，都是大家竭誠洽商的結晶，我敢代表政府先行聲明，政府必然十分尊重，一俟完成規定手續以後，即當分別照案實行。本人認爲各案之中要稱和平建國綱領爲各種方案的基本之中心，因爲此案從甲總則，乙人民權利，丙政治。了軍事，戊外交，己經濟及財政，庚敎育及文化，辛善後救濟，壬僑務等九章的各條規定，均屬異常完備，確合時代，要求充滿了統一性，充滿了民主性，實在是渡到憲政時期最適宜的綱領，我們有了這個綱領，由小央以至全國各地方的政府，由各黨各派與社會領導人士，以至全國各地的同胞，都有了共同運守的準則，尤其參加本會議的谷黨各派，對於這個綱領，旣是大家共同商討，共同議定，而且就要參加政府，來共同執行。我們對全國同胞，必須守信義·負責任·自身先從事實行動方面有切實遵行的表現，並且必須貫澈其全國性，使能普遍的實現。</p>
<p>政黨儘何公開組織不應再用武裝暴動</p>
<p>我以爲有兩件事，我們必須特別注意和鄭重聲明：第一，本綱領旣經夫定「確保人已享有身體·思想·宗敎·信仰·言論·出版·集會·結社·居住·遷徙·通訊之自由，」所有現行若干戰時法令，於此原則有抵觸的，中央當然要修正廢止。同時，我相信，中共軍隊駐在地之內，自必同樣遵守這個綱領，解除現有的一切限制，至於在敎育文化方面，又規定了「保障學術自由，不以宗敎不以政治思想干涉學校行政」這一條對于我國教育文化的發展與求學青年良好環境的義成，更是十分重要，今後自己的保障，全國無論任何地方，當然只有合於本綱領的一種法令，不應再有任何歧異和特殊的辦法，那麽，今後各個政黨的活動，以至對政治的競爭。儘可依照國家統一法令應有的合法權利和手續，公開組織，公開進行，決不應該再有使用武裝暴動，或者在各地秘密組議的行爲，否則則即是喪失政黨的本質，破壞了民主的精神，但違反了本綱領，而且阻揍了憲政進程。我們如果要不愧爲民主國家的政黨，必須革除自民元以來所有政黨過去一切不良的現象，纔有建立現代國家的希望。</p>
<p>實斿整軍必須貫澈軍政人員確切遵守</p>
<p>第二本綱領丁項軍事一章，對於軍隊國家化的宗旨與規定，極爲切實，另外還有一個經過軍事組協商而更詳細的軍事方案，我想我們旣然迫切需要和平與統一，則綱領的軍事部份，實爲鞏固和平完成統一的最大要素。政府對於軍隊整遍問題，早經有所所決定，并在着手實施，日前軍政部　次長並已向本會議詳細報告，將來還要按照綱領與方案的規定，繼續推進。至於中共方面的軍隊整編，自然也要依照綱領與方案切實整編。本來軍政軍令的統一，爲立國必需的基本條件，這不僅全國飽經痛苦的同胞所一致要求，也是各黨派所一再聲明，認爲不可否認的原則。現在協商會議已有結果，繼領方面均經商定，我們當前最急要的任務，就是要使全國所有軍隊，不分黨派，不分地區，都能聽命於政府的指揮，以達到綱領所定軍令軍政和軍制統一的標準·這一點我敢確信是人同此心心同此理，而決沒有例外的。惟有這樣確實做到，幾能符合建國的要求，纔能安慰人民的渴望，吾則不僅大家參加政府沒有意義，而且和平團結也將沒有基礎，反而增加了國家的危機，與政府內部的糾結，這當然不曙家已族所需要求，也決非各位會員和各政黨忠誠謀國的本意。上面所與的兩點，確是本納領能否全面貫澈金石，果能澈底做到，則全國各地秩序立刻可以安定，復員工作亦可以順利完成，而本綱領其他的各章各條，亦無一不可迎刃而解，完滿實施，這是本會同人無可推諉的職責。今天我以最懇摯的悃忱，特別提取大家的注意，同時我個人誓必忠實信守這個綱領，更必督實我們各級軍政人員，恪切遵守，即使有時難免無心錯誤，或者督察不周，只要大家說明指出，無論我本人或是我的部屬，都無不誠懇接受，切實改正。我常常說「要求自由必先了解自由的本質，不可只顧個人的自由，而侵犯別人的自由，崇尚民主必先修養法治的習慣，不可專資別人守法，而自己則處處置身於法外」。我這幾句話實在是鑒於我國社會對於自由與民主觀念的模糊，和法治與守法意識的薄弱，諸爲社會沒有安寗，便是國家沒有基礎，人民不重法治，必使種罪惡借民主自由之名義而行。因之，我上面幾句話，實在是沉痛的呼籲，尤其近年以來社會上和敎育界所表現的這種病態，更是深刻而顯著，長此不加改進，我們中國將無法自立於現代國家之林，諸位會員想必也有同同感。現在我們政治協商會議商訂了和平建國綱領，這一個綱領是以保障民主自由爲職志，以建立和平統一的法治國家爲目的，我們大家爲求發揮本會議的實效，開創建國的規模必作須先從我們自身負起轉移風氣的責任，樹立守法　精神，以作全國人民的楷模，那纔可以完成我們對歷史對時代的使命。</p>
<p>建國大業今日開始　已族前途共負大責</p>
<p>最後我要趁今天會議完成大家聚首一堂的時候，將我多年來蘊蓄在心而沒有與的活簡單的向各位申述。中正個人從幼年起對政治是不感興趣的，平生的抱負和事業，是祇知獻身於國民革命，以期救國救民。自辛亥革命以至於現在抗戰勝利，這三十五年之中所有革命戰役，無役不從，戁難困苦所不經，自省革命志願與應盡的革命義務，幸無隕越，對於國家和人民亦已盡了我一份子的天職，總可自慰。今天雖不能說國民革命已經完全成功，但是剷除革命障碍的工作，確已告一段落，自今“始，國家完全進入建國大業開始的時期了。可是我們國家當此元氣凋傷之後，國運前途的危難，和建國事業的艱鉅，只有比戰前乃至戰時更加嚴重，實在不勝臨　履冰之懼，幸而此次政治協商會議訂定了和平建國綱領及各種有關問題的方案，建國初基已具，憲政實施有期，今後各黨各派的中堅份子，以及社會賢達，都將參加政府，共同負起對國家民族前途的大責，今後建國的重擔，旣不是國民黨一黨的責任，更不是中正個人的責任，這一個重大的責任，要交託給各位同人和全國同胞來共同擔負，今後中正無論在朝在野，均必本着公民應盡的責任，忠實的堅決的遵守本會議一切的決議，確保和平團結的一貫精誠，督促我們國家走上統一民主的光明大道，以期報答爲革命抗戰犧牲的先烈，完成國父締造民國未竟的事功，同時要求各位同人爲國家爲人民共同努力一本我們在抗戰時期共患難同生死的精神，同德同心，精誠團結，來担負今後建國的重任。開闢我們國家民族光明燦爛的前途？（完）</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓三十一日電〕杜魯門總統今向國會提出租借案活動之第二十一次報告，該項報告內容係截至一九四五年九月三十日爲止，關於對日作戰之一段，其要點如左　運輸租借品對日作戰，較之對德作戰之需要實爲次要。此種物品之流出美國，始於一九四一年五月。自該時期以迄珍珠港事件，輸出共値四千萬美元，在日本投降時，租借案軍火及其他戰爭供應品之輸出，共達三十八萬萬美元，此種物品乃促成日本投降之主要因素。除此以外，吾人復以價値一萬萬六千七百萬美元之供應品，運與各戰區美國畏官，並依照租借案規定轉發各盟國。吾人遣送租借案飛機八千八百架至亞洲及太平洋戰區，其中包括四引擎之轟炸機八百五十架，二引擎及一引擎之轟炸機一千四百五十二架，驅逐變二千八百架，運輸機一千三百六十架，其餘數字乃係訓練用之飛機，運輸機係用以自某一基地載運供應品至另一基地，同時並運往中國。吾人依照租借案曾運出坦克三千二百輛，其中大部份運往印度。吾人又以二十一美輪汽車輸往與日本作戰之盟國。</p>
<p>自計劃開始迄一九四五年十月一日輸往中國之租借品，約値二萬萬二千四百萬美元，但實際上美國租借案對中國之援助已超出上項輸出之價値。我人授權各區美軍司令畏官以租借品移交中國，在此方面之租借品共値一萬萬六千七百萬美元，此項數字並不包括於上述輸出數字之內。我人又以其他各種方式之援助予以中國，例如練習飛行之飛機及在美訓練飛行員所有之配備，同時在華美軍之用品移交中國軍隊，亦例入租借援助一類，但此種移交，吾人尚未完全獲得截至目前爲止之最近報告。中國軍隊最需要軍火及運輸器材，而上述種類大部已能括合其需要，我人復以有限制但極重要之精細機器用具零件及不可多得之金屬供給中國，協助彼等增加其本身之軍火生產，依照租借案，我人又可以技術人員供給中國，担任監導及技術位置，我人曾以一千餘之美國技術人員遣至遠東，修練中國人員修理並使用運輸工具。</p>

<h3 id="c43">蒙巴頓靜如處女動若脫兔　東南亞乾坤旋轉 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 三報十二月廿二日航訊　雪演寄自倫敦</p>
<p>從英國看來，歐洲和遠實爾戰區的戰後問題，完全不同，對於英國的作用，也　然異趣。歐洲經過這次浩刦後，創痍滿目，民生凋疲，當前最迫切的是需要救濟。各小國內都，又紛紛有左右傾之爭，英國的希望，祇要在這左右派的爭執中，不要把英國的影響力完全漠視了。大家知道英國對歐洲大陸的傳統政策，是採取旁觀者的態度，不捲入其內部的糾結，英國所最關切的是大陸上不要有壓倒的強國出現，所以常支持次強，以抵抗最強的強國，保持均勢，使英國本身的力量，得集中於帝國的發展。英國在這次戰後，對歐洲是否仍採取這種傳統政策，我們不得而知，但至少英國也沒有明白表示要放棄這個傳統政策。有人說，目前英國極力支持法國，就是這種新均勢政策的表現，這也許是正確的。所以英國對歐洲的政策，是如何救濟民生，恢復安定以及維持均勢，大致可以說是偏重消極方面的。戰後問題也就是善後問題。</p>
<p>蒙巴頓將軍　一手處理東南亞</p>
<p>但是遠東戰區，情形便大不相同了。遠東戰區中，和英國發生密切關係的，是東南亞戰區，這正是物質富饒，人民智識水準低下的區域，天然資源，甚多未經開發，從財富方面說，是一片寶藏無窮，所以已是前程無窮的大寳庫，在今日糾紛多，發展機會的大英帝國內，說不定會展開一個新天地，所以英國處理這戰區的戰後問題，比較有積極性，寄託無限的希望。</p>
<p>東南亞祇是一個籠統的地理名詞，沒有固定的界限，凡在東南亞盟軍總司令指揮權範圍以內的區域，都是東南亞。日本投降後，暹邏及越南南部，規定也由東南亞盟軍總司令受降，所以這兩地也算是東南亞範圍以內。中國古兵書稱許將略最有名的二句話是「靜如處女，動如脫兎，」東南亞軍總司令蒙巴頓將軍，最配得上這二句評語。自從東南亞盟軍總部創設以來，他在錫蘭坐鎭二年，指揮若定，可以說是靜如處女。待日軍投降，他立刻採取行動，數月之間，不但緬甸，馬來，新嘉坡等地，已完全收復，就是在暹邏，越南南都，及荷英屬的南洋羣島等地，他也着着部署，有了顯著的成績。今日東南亞偌大的領土，都在由他處置的過程中。</p>
<p>對漢屬越南　英協助恢復秩序</p>
<p>我們留心今日的東南亞，知這軍事問題，除荷印外，大多已經過去，就是荷印的軍事，也已不是解除日軍武裝的問題，而是英軍，荷蘭軍，及本地革命軍相互間的問題。而政治問題，却比較的複雜，且因各地的膝史背景不一，所以處理的方式，自然也各有不同。其中舊屬於英國的殖民地，如緬甸，馬來亞，及英屬南洋等地，主要的是恢復原狀，依然回到大英帝國的範團以內。目前最迫切的是物價的統制，商品的供應，立即需要解決，但這長目前全世界幾乎是普遍的現象，不足爲奇的。其次，是法屬越南南部，英國處理的政策，也很明朗，主要是解除日軍武裝，恢復秩序，因爲要恢復秩序，也努力馴服當地人民反抗法國的勢力。現在這下椿任務，都已告一段落，大致不久就可以照原樣交還法國。越南在日軍佔領期間，法國對之也曾有過許多諾言，但這些諾言的如何履行，是今後法國的事，英國沒有說要把它列爲交還條件之一。這與以後我們所要談到的荷印問題，顯然不同。今日東南亞的戰後問題中，最微妙的要算暹邏和荷印問題，但這兩地最近也已有了新結果了。</p>
<p>對美妥協後　英暹簽和平協定</p>
<p>暹邏戰前算是獨立國，自太平洋戰爭發生後，它是惟一與日本合作在遠東逞凶的國家，他曾經在靈南邊境對中國用過兵，在戰前就壓迫華僑，在戰爭過程中，在全世界各國中對華僑行凶最狠而日本屈服後，是始終不肯悔悟，　績殘殺華倫的惟一國家。這次跟着日本投降，由東南亞盟軍總部派兵進駐，解除其境內日軍的武裝，並對暹邏有所懲罰，我們不但贊成，並且十分注意，早就聽說暹邏已派代表到新嘉坡去，與蒙巴頓將軍的代表商討和平協定。但於和平協定的內容，倫敦報紙刋載甚少。至於少的原因，據我們推測，不是英國人民不注意，而是英國人民很信任蒙巴頓軍將，覺得經過蒙巴頓的手的出品，必不致不利於英國的，母庸仔細顧問，有時不顧問，讓他悄悄的進行，對英國或更能有益些。直到十二月十九日，美國的國務院忽然傳出消息，說英國目前和暹邏所商談的和平協定，其結果等於使暹邏成爲英國的附庸。同時美國駐倫敦的代辦，也正式到英國外交部去詢問，說明美國的意見。從此以後，英國報紙才漸漸透露協定的內容，並代政府解釋，謂條件不算太苛。據說惟一較苛的條件，是要暹邏賠償米一百五十萬噸，但以暹邏今年可預卜的豐收來講，也就不算過分，不致妨碍暹邏本身的民食了。後來報紙也隱隱約的的提到英政府在向美國解釋，也有若干報紙預測協定的簽訂要延期了。直到十二月廿二日，美國國務院宣布撤回提議，並謂美國的建議，雖未爲英方所全部接受，但大部已被接受，所以美國的延期簽字要求，自動撤回。於是英國和暹邏間的和平協定，遂於今年元旦在新嘉坡簽字。由於上述的經過，我們可以相信現在簽訂的協定，是英美妥協約結果，至於原來的條件，因爲從來沒有完全披露過，當然不知，就是美國所提出的建議是什麼，英國所接受的部分是什麼，也不知道。</p>
<p>協定九要點　包括禁運暹米等</p>
<p>協定的要點，倫敦二日各報，都已刋載，大致爲：（一）自一九四一年十二月七日後暹邏所侵佔的英屬領土，完全歸還。（二）在戰爭期間，英國在暹邏境內所受的公私權益及財產的損失，應由暹邏政府歸還，並賠償損失。（三）暹邏對聯合國機構中所規定的國際安全措施，應完全合作，克峽地峽的運河，非商得英國同意，不能開掘。（四）暹邏與英國及暹邏附近，的英屬地應儘速恢復進出口貿易，沿海航務，重訂商的航約。（五）在一九四七年九月一日前，除非經在華盛頓的聯合局（Combined）的介紹，暹邏應禁止米·錫·橡皮·麻栗本（Teak）的出口，並以米一百五十萬噸免費供給附近英屬地的食用。（六）儘速與印度商訂商的航約，關於處置錫和橡皮的一般國際措施，暹邏皆應參加。（七）恢復暹邏境內的英商民航權益，最低限度，也應恢復到一九四一年十二月七日前所許予帝國航空公司（Imperial　Air　ways所享的權益。（八）恢復一九四一年十二月七日前暹邏與英國或印度所參加的一切國際條約或協定。又一九四一年十二月七日前英國或印度所參加（暹邇未參加）的國際條約，暹邏也須履行義務。而自一九四一年十二月七日以後所設立的國際機構下所引起的責任義務，暹邏也應遵守履行。（九）鑒於上述各條歌，英即承認計蓬　的鴃寨已結束，恢復正常的國際狀態，交換外交使節，英印支持暹邏參加聯合國機構。這協定的一造，是英國和印度的代表，另一造是　　代表。</p>
<p>英印獲補償　中國應有所要求</p>
<p>因爲英國報紙所披露的不是協一定的原文，我們無從推測這是否就是協定的全部條約。假使重是這樣，那末美國所傳將使暹邏成爲英國屬地之說，未免過甚。或則這和原來的稿本已有不同，是英國接受美方建議後的結果。單就上述的條款看，我們首先注意的，是沒有一條提到撤兵問題，其次這雖是英印和這邏所訂的協定，但暹邏的重要產品，都已受到限制，不能自由出口了。因爲華盛頓的聯合局，事實上祇是英美二國的機關，所以別國縱與　邏再訂約，也已無法問津了。至於米的出口，最堪注意，中國在未來二年中，或則也需要運進暹邏米來救濟災區，現在已經受了限制。在這次戰爭中，我們中國及僑民所受到暹邏的毒害最深，英印現在已經得到補償了，中國也應要求賠償。又英印與暹邏的協定成立後，對於暹邏境內商業及經濟的影響是很深刻的，而暹邏境內的華僑大多在經濟界及商業界，我們最低限度，也應立刻採取步驟，防止暹邏政府把這個責任轉嫁到我們華僑身上。</p>
<p>英加強控制　對東印維持中立</p>
<p>東印，尤共是巴達維亞的秩序之恢復與日軍武裝之解除，要算最麻煩了。倫敦報紙所刊載的，也是關於這方面的消息最多，都是有關軍事的消息。荷印在日軍佔領期間，曾被界予所謂獨立也者的地位，多少播下一點民族意識的種子，而且日本在所謂「大東亞共榮圈」的號召下，得到當地居民合作的程度，似較在西方國家統治下好些。這點英荷等國也已了解，邱吉爾以前也在國會中提到過。荷蘭的威廉女皇，於一九四二年十二月六日的演說中，也對東印許諾過許多開明的措施，宣布一旦東印重歸荷蘭時，當以較大的參政權，界予當地居民。今年八月，日軍投降後，東印解放的責任，也落在東南亞盟軍總部的身上。但東南亞盟軍總部的兵力，分配不敷，到九月中才能以少量的隊伍，登陸於東印。當時馬來民族已組成共和政府，而且似乎得到了一部分日軍的軍械，所以也擁有相當的武力。而英軍的任務，說明祗在解除日軍武裝，解放被拘於荷印境內的戰俘和維持秩序。對於當地居民的獨立運動，聲明不干涉，對於居民與荷蘭當局的衝突，採取中立態度。但另一個武力，存在一日，英軍控制東印的力量，總是不完全的，隨着英軍的增加，對於島上的控制，自然也加强·加以荷蘭的軍隊，也跟着荷蘭設在南洋的統治機構，開到東印，軍事衝突，就免不了。據英國報紙傳載；印度尼西亞族所組的獨立政府當局，對軍隊的號令，不　貫澈，而印度尼西亞族輩隊的紀律，又不很嚴明，遂往往成爲治安的威脅，縱然和印度尼四亞族的政治當局，談判得好好的，暴行仍然不免。到聖　前後，英軍的力量，已相當充實，乃通知印度尼西亞族當局，以其所有的隊伍，歸由英軍當局指揮，藉以保障治安。待此舉實現後，軍事行動似可告段落了。</p>
<p>在此期間，荷蘭政府，感覺非常棘手。荷蘭的總理舒米亨敎授（Prof.　Schermnerliro）和東印度總督摩克（Van　Mook）博士，特地於聖誕節前到倫敦來，準備先　　　當局交換意為穢，再決定江該採取的步編，舒米亭等到達做敦時，適　英　相　時里趁聖　假期下鄉去了，所以等到二十八日方舉行會談·本來一般推測，以爲會談時間很長，起碼二日，誰知一天就結束了。會後舒米亭激授表示：會談結果，甚爲圓滿。唐寗街十號，並就此事發表公報，內容包括二大部分：第一部分，是說明此次談話經過，在商談爪哇的情形，和所欲採取的有效行動，以恢復當地的法律和秩序。而荷蘭對印度尼西亞族所欲採取的開明政策，已充分告知英國。第二部分，說明英國的責任：（一）盡速建立安全秩序，俾荷屬東印度政府得與印度尼西亞族代表繼續進行會談。（二）雨國歡府承劍解決政治蔔突是英劉任務完成之主要條件之一。（三）兩國政府同意促進荷印當局與民族運動分子之間的諒解。（四）盡力保障騷俘和被拘於荷印的平民。我們看這個公報，覺得新意甚少，似乎尚不足以說明兩國的政策和態度，荷蘭如僅依這公報中所述，去解決荷印的問題，恐怕不能獲致較以前更大的成就。我們從這公報中所能得到唯一暗示，似乎在英國的立塲，對荷蘭與印度尼西亞族等量齊觀，無所軒輊，並沒有在一處忘記印度尼西亞族的確是很公正中立的。如以之與英國處理越南南部的態度來相比較，顯然有所不同。現在東印度總督摩克博士聽說準備回荷印去了，目的是在與印度尼西亞族代表商談，謀解決政治衝突。他在未出發以前，先表示此去不見極端分子。將來結果怎樣，要看事實的演變。我們不敢過早地預測某能達到成功。</p>

<h3 id="c45">技術家幕後動員　掃除磁雷　英海軍部古德武博士揭穿真相 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 本報編室譯</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰，並不祗限於海陸空三方面戰塲；最有趣的，是英美的科學家們在幕後也動員他們的全部智力，和日德的科學家們暗鬥於科學戰塲上的種種事實。這些在戰時　得的經騐，在達到勝利和平的奮鬥中，很有它深重的效果。技術戰爭中最突出的一塲劇門，——我們可說它本身就是一種戰爭，——是在無綫電上戰勝的。世人所週知的「雷達」，也包括在這塲戰鬥之內。</p>
<p>武器雷達　多方面操縱活動</p>
<p>雷達的發展，產生了最驚人的結果。一位英國科學家首先發現雷達在軍事上的意義，那便是：飛機上發出的無綫電浪回聲，可以千涉無綫電視的收取。事實證明，英吉利海峽不再成爲一座障礙籬笆。所以一切有關這偵察搜索和確定位置的新方法可能硏究工作，都被厲行過。當一九四田〇年八月間，那偉大的試驗日子到來時，一切俱已齊備。在德空軍總攻英倫的「不列顚大戰」中，英國駕駛員曾擊落很多進犯的納粹飛行員。可是，指示他們趨向攻擊目標的，還是在幕後操縱雷達的那一批專家技術人員。</p>
<p>雷達不僅征服了迷霧和黑夜，它還使電子物理學的應用範圍大爲擴展。電子物理學從相當小的應用範圍，擴大到目前，幾已佔有英國政府整個科學努力上的半個領域了。幾乎在侮處戰塲上，都可以發現無綫常燈泡和陰極光綫的眞空管，將來或許在平時生活上，也會如此。</p>
<p>道些發現和成績，都是英國領導成功的。她和美國交換一切有關情報，並且密切地合作着。德國人偶然從大陸上空擊落下來的英美飛機內，得到一些有關這新科學發明的資料，他們也模仿過。德海軍上將杜尼資描摹英國如何用雷達克服潛艇威脅的情形說：「發明用無錢電搜索位置方法的科學家，都被當作他們祖國的救星。使英人在潛艇戰中獲勝的，並非他們戰略或戰術上的優異，這完全是科學研究上優勝所致。」無綫電戰需要物理學家的迫切與衆多，實爲空前！英國的專冢全部動員，甚至於全世界的專家們也都被授羅去了。除此之外，還從各種科學部門裏抽派不少新的人才。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰的主要專門技術戰，是物資戰；這一次是化學家們的戰爭。英國在第二次世界大戰中的種種準備，還都是在那時候化學工業上打的堅强基礎。那時，各部門化工都已有它規模浩大的硏究實騐所。物資戰在道次大戰內，仍舊繼續進行着，不過很少有像第一次大戰時產生的嚴重問題吧了。</p>
<p>每一塲大戰中，必須有設計工程家參加；但是這種人才最感缺乏。要知道如何方可造就一個好的設計工程家，一是件困難事情。</p>
<p>磁性水雷　表現了技術智慧</p>
<p>在時間存續上，在技術成就上，在人力上，磁性水雷戰或許和無綫電或反潛艇蜚屬同一種類；可是它是這次大戰內第一次技術戰。它在利害關係上，同其它兩種是具有其一致性的，同時也是英國所戰勝而德國所意想不到的一仗戰事，它的反響力是很重要的。</p>
<p>在任何一次戰鬥中，必須曉得敵人所用的是什麽武器·在技術戰上，也須如此，尤其是採取守勢的一方，很需要依賴它的技術智慧。一九三九年十月間，事實上英國雖已知道敵人在使用磁性水霄，她却不能正確地明瞭磁性水雷的特質，所以還沒有得到足以眞正抵禦的進步方法。</p>
<p>第一枚磁性水雷的俘獲，和它被分析的故事，現在已在報端和無錢電中普遍地被談論着·人們都很談着「遞膠新」"Deganuss-ing"那便是艦艇的電氣安全帶。但那不過是這件故事的一部份，因爲「遞膠新」方法祇是部份的保衛。這是很明顯的，敵人敷置水雷後，如果可能，當然需要儘速掃除掉。</p>
<p>德人的磁性水雷，是照第一次大戰時式樣改善的。假使一根磁性的鋼桿，在中間支持一個橫的軸，使它可在一條直平綫上（好像玩曉板戲的板）自由旋轉滾動，（以代指南針上的橫平綫辦法）那末這根鋼桿的北極針，自會往下移到某一角度，這角度的度數大小，要看它離開北磁極多少遠而定（在這針的自己位置裏，它會轉移到橫的平面上，在地磁赤道綫上，它並不下移，假如在地磁赤道綫以南，那末南極針便會下移）用一種自動調整的螺旋式彈簧，來裝置這種針，可以正確地　出彈簧的力量，使這枚針朝彈簧的相等還是相反的力量方面移動。在一艘鋼的船艇底下，磁性的活動地位較平常的塲合大，一枚平衡的針，便會下移，發生電的接觸。關於磁雷掃除方面的技術上的故事，將另篇補述。</p>

<p>近代化建築　空殼猶存</p>
<p>藩陽大連長春及哈爾濱爲東北四大重鎮，此四大域市之景况，足代表東北之面目。光復後之東北現狀，據記者所得之印象，槪括言之：今日東北所存者，乃爲成千成萬之堅固巨大而近代化之空殼建築，復興尚待吾人付以最大努力。東北現代化之鐵路交通，今已陷於癱瘓狀態。長春鐵路之墊繡梯形鐵路，仍在行駛火車，惟行車次數大减，路基久不整理，車行欠穩。由長春經瀋陽至大連客車，侮日對開一次。哈長段每日對開三次，兩段客車行旅極爲擁擠。途中秩序旣不佳，而復寒冷不堪，而乘客且每以安抵目的地爲最幸運之事。</p>
<p>哈長瀋市政　漸見進步</p>
<p>哈長瀋大四市，除大速市外，餘均已有市長，推動市政。瀋陽市政，在困難環境中，已有最迅速之進步，工務敎育兩項工作業已開始，且有相當成就。籌備大批物款，準備歡迎國軍。長春市政，因社會較安定，較瀋陽易於開展。關於財敎工警等工作，已照計劃進行。哈市市政基礎未動，社會秩序尚好·除敎育工作須加强外，其他祇須繼續推動即司。</p>
<p>大多數工廠　恢復在即</p>
<p>四市工業，除長哈兩市外瀋大兩市爲工業高度化地帶，百分之七十工廠，雖遭破壞，均不難恢復，東北商業在四市中，以前均相當發達，其中以瀋陽最爲繁盛。自日本投降後，商業即趨凋零，商店紛紛停業。大商店中所陳列者，皆爲日本之粗陋日用品。四市中攤販甚多，且多係日本婦女擺設者。</p>

<h3 id="c47">外匯應從速確定 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>外滙問題，日來傳說紛紜，不可著墨。俞財長近曾表示，不久即將公佈，報載陪都電訓，且云業已確定，而據駐滬財政金融特派員公署消息，則謂絕對不確·究竟確與不確，只可證之於事實。我們意見，却希望其確，且希望其從速確定，從速公佈實施。</p>
<p>我們知道：工潮澎湃，社會俶擾不安，這裏頭，雖有許多的原因，而大半由於物價的高昂，與波動的劇烈。我們又知道：物價的高昻，與波動的劇烈，雖也有許多原因，而大半由於幣値的不穩定。幣値應該趕緊謀其穩定，本報昨日社論，巳略說其大概。</p>
<p>幣値究竟如何方能穩定？其間接的因素，當然也是很多，但直接的與最迅捷的辦法，却不能不從確定外滙比率入手。因爲法幣的本身，並無內在的價値，其準備又並不依賴於物資，而寄托於國家所握有的外滙基金，故法幣早與物資脫了節，而其價值的高低，竟已完全寄托在滙率上。所以確定外滙，無異是確定幣値，而確定幣値，亦即是穩定物價，穩定生活。</p>
<p>復員以來，初以偽幣兌換率的不確定，引起了物價的軒然大波。迨僞幣兌換率確定後，又以外滙率未確定，屢屢引起了物價的軒然大波。這共中，投機家的興風作浪，和囤積商的推波助瀾，固應負共大部份的責任，但此等投機家和囤積商之樂於興風作浪和推波助瀾，也無非出於侔利的一念。換句話說，即乘外滙未確定時，竊窺旁睨，儘量地上下其手，甚至屢屢散播謠言，以獵取一時的暴利。而孰知大衆的生活，和社會的安寗秩序，都被他們大大的牽動！故榨殺平民生計的，是此輩投機家與囤積商，而使此輩投機家與囤積商所以能榨殺平民生計者，乃是因循寡斷不能即知即行的當局。政府至今尚不確定滙率，以收確定幣値之效，則「我雖不殺伯仁，伯仁由我而死」，當局宜不能無動於中。</p>
<p>我們以爲今天要消弭工潮，安定民生，已非枝枝節節的今天加薪明天年賞所可解決，祇有從速盡可能的力量來穩定幣値，使物價不致上漲·而穩定幣値之法，則以從速確定外滙比率，最爲直捷了當·當然，在滙率公佈之初，一切物價與工資，需要一度的調整，在這調整期中，依舊免不掉若干騷動，而且此番的騷動，也可能地比已往和現在更爲激烈。但一經調整就緒，此後一切物價，雖未必能完全寗靜，完全回復平時的狀態，而共波動的幅度，終不會和現時一樣，似可斷言。最要不得的，是政府執行政策的中道而廢。萬一公佈滙率，就要有定見，有毅力，否則舉棋不定，出爾反爾，徒然使投機家國積商多一次機會。一個較好的政策，或竟可以收到很壞的結果！</p>
<p>至於高滙率或低滙率，高物價或低物價，所謂見仁見智，利害參半，這幾個月來，各方面的研究討論，也已經詳　無遺，不須加以覆述。但看今天本報所披露的讀者楊靑濤君的意見，就可窺見一般平民的心理，對這個問題已經認爲燃眉之急，不能再讓政府放任少數投機家國積商來投機發財的了。天下事最怕社會不平，一切亂源禍根，都從「不平」中演化出來。低滙率則高物價，高滙率則低物價，固然見仁見智，而究竟對一種政策對人民大衆有利，那一種政策能够穩定一般的人民生計，只要看道兩三天來的謠言漲價情形，可以思過半矣。我們姑且不提供單方面的意見，請政府作一顧到全盤的考慮。但考慮則可，拖延則不可；審愼硏究則可，放任謠言投機則不可。故無論滙率的高低如何，我們今天所最爲盼望的，就是當局從速確定，從速實行這一點。此項滙率，如果定得十分愜當，使各方面都可以得到相當的滿意，自爲我們所歡迎；即使統籌象顧，事實上不易做到，或許某一方面要認爲失望，但比揣測紛紜，上落莫定，使整個的人民生活，長在擾攘不安之中，整個的工業生產，長在觀望停滯之中，整個的進出口貿易，長在堵塞停　之中，終究要好得多多。</p>
<p>或認爲國內外的物價，今天相差太遠，此時匆匆規定，事實上不易維持，這也不無理由。不過兩害相權，只能取其輕者。爲減輕民生的痛苦，和經濟界的杌　不安起見，我們認爲從速解決，仍比遷延不決爲有利．</p>
<p>當然，要穩定幣値，不能單靠確定外滙這一著·假如協商會議功敗垂成，軍費無法縮減，通貨無法緊縮，生產事業無法促進，勢將連確定的滙率或許也無法維持下去·不過滙率的確定，到底是穩定幣値和穩定物價的先次條件，所以我們仍贊成從速確定。</p>

<p>— 楊青濤</p>
<p>（一）取締投機活動</p>
<p>爲安定國民經濟起見，目前最迫切的問題，應當是提高幣値，壓平物價。吾則幣値日跌，物價暴騰，繼之以職工爲要求加薪而罷工，工廠爲不勝負擔而萎縮，是非特一般人民的生活常受威脅，並且民族工業也無法建立起來。所以時至今日，如個整個的國家經濟政策尚未全部確定，則至少應先採取一種緊急的措置，以提高幣値，壓平物價，而使國民的經濟生活趨於安定。</p>
<p>查近數月來物價日漲夜大，原因很多；挽救之道，也不祗一端。例如增加生產，以使供求相應；便利交通，以使貨暢其源。這些根本問題，不是一蹴所能解決的。現在所要請求政府採取的緊急措置，乃是立即明令制止投機活動。因爲投機活動，造成一般人輕視法幣價値，罔顧政府信用的心理，以致紛紛拋幣進貨，誘使物價更漲，職工薪資再加，通貨繼續增發，而這復助長投機活動的加劇。這樣反復循環的結果，僅僅產生了少數賭博性投機活動的暴發戶，然而却迫害了大多數國民的經濟生活，促致國家財政和國民經濟的日趨破產崩潰之境！今天政府當局坐視上海市塲投機家的活躍，好像不聞不見，眞令人莫名其妙！</p>
<p>在今日的投機活動中居於領導地位的，是匯率謠言和黃金投機。例如一月廿八日廿九日，因匯率謠傳和金價飛漲，就曾誘致其他一切物價的狂漲風潮。自然，政府應當儘速取締任何國積居奇和投機活動，不過最先應當解決的，則是外匯問題和黃金問題。</p>
<p>（二）黃金收歸國有</p>
<p>黃金投機，領導着其他的投機活動；黃金漲價，更刺戰了其他貨物的漲價。爲謀戢止投機和壓平物價，我主張並建議政府迅即明令把全國黃金收歸國有。</p>
<p>黃金國有的政策，基於後列的理由，也有儘速實行的必要：</p>
<p>一，抗戰以來凡發國難財和勝利財的，有不少人已將其財產調換黃金。黃金收歸國有，可使這班人的黃金不能隨心所欲變成通貨，以供其安富尊榮，而眼看一般平民求生不得。果然，持有黃金者未必都是非法利用國難或勝利而取得，不過他們到底是少數，而且必非貧民。如果能使國民經濟走上安定的正軌，那末即或使這些並非貧民的少數人暫時惑受不便，，（因爲黃金國有，並不等於沒收黃金，所以他們可以不受犧牲），也是可行的。</p>
<p>二，在布里敦金融協定中，規定由各國政府出定量的黃金作爲世界銀行的準備。該協定已經我國政府批准今後自須繳納足量的黃金。但我國現金不多，因此再不可任令黃金流散於私人之手，而應謀集中於政府。爲此，我國更不能不採取黃金國有的政策。再則，將來的國際貿易須由國家出面而經世界銀行淸算，私人持有的黃金不能作爲對外貿易淸算的基準，所以私有的黃金將無價值可言。</p>
<p>三，黃金國有的政策一經實行，不但使政府的黃金準備增加·而且由制止黃金投機進而制止一切投機活動之後，足以减少大批專事賭博性的投機而不事生產的寄生蟲，以及省下許多因這班投機家暴發而引起的豪華浪費·這直接間接都可以增加國富。</p>
<p>由前述種種理由，黃金收歸國有是有利無弊而應當儘速實行的事。至關於黃金國有政策的實行方法，護建議如後：</p>
<p>一，立刻禁止黃金的私相賣買，取締金市塲，違者拘辦。</p>
<p>二，由政府指定可靠銀行或機關，以合理的法定價格，收買私人的藏金。金價一律發給公債，不付現款，以免增加法幣的流通額三，黃金的收買分三期進行：第一期假定爲二個月，償付目前合理價格的公債；第二期亦假定爲二個月，償付，貶低價格的公價；過此期限以後爲第三期，凡私藏的黃金，一律無償沒收。惟無論收買或沒收，一律須給與負責的憑據，以免營私舞弊。</p>
<p>（三）提高對外匯率</p>
<p>關於最近熱烈討論着的對外匯率問題，我人主張應當儘早決定，並且應當酌量提高。有些人以維護民族工業爲理由，而主張降低匯率，即法幣貶値。但由一月二十八日前後匯率變更法幣貶値的謠言一起，立刻刺戟金價與一般物價的狂漲，可見一旦匯率眞的降低，必先誘致物價的暴騰·由這現實的經騐，應知匯率降低的結果，徒然造成金融物價的混亂，旣來不及促進輸出貿易，更談不到維護民族工業。</p>
<p>反之，匯率提高，一則可使外貨源源運入，自能收到壓平物價之效；再則今後我國的經濟建設，需要向先進各國購置新式機件，而匯率提高以後，便可大量購置這種必要的機器，實有助於經濟的建設和工業的振興。</p>
<p>由上所述，無論從理論上或事實上講，降低匯率是只見其弊，不見其利；提高匯率，則利多於弊。所以吾人反對降低匯率，而主張提高匯率。至於促進對外輸出和維護民族工業的方法，泆不能靠降低匯率的方法，已如前述（因爲降低匯率的風聲一傳出，國內的物價先就騰漲起來了），而應當請求政府與各友邦簽定適合的貿易協定，規定輸入品的種類和數量以及輸出品的程度和價格，或用其他的經濟計劃來扶助，才能解決問題。</p>
<p>匯率應當儘速決定，並且應當比現行黑市匯率爲高。須知匯率降低，法幣貶値的結果，不特在事實上無補於輸出貿易和民族工業，抑且誘致物價狂漲，而政府信用也就隨之破壞了！</p>
<p>（四）希望果斷實行</p>
<p>自從勝利以來，政府當局對於經濟措置，考慮太多，致被少數投機家乘機掀風作浪，物價有漲無已，民生倒懸已極！吾人爲謀民生安定，促進建設，而且也正爲了愛護政府，提高威信，用特貢獻愚見如上。尙祈執政當局，除從速議定全盤的具體的經濟計劃以外，另外先行採取緊急措置，立刻明令黃金國有，制止投機，提高匯率，壓平物價，果斷實行，勿再猶豫。</p>

<p>市電力公司工潮僵持多日，昨日下午三時許，因工人家屬前往該廠請求工會釋放工人，返家度歲，致廠內發生衝突，經警察局派警前往彈壓，全體工人，已紛紛離廠，公司方面，並布告善後辦法，茲誌各情如次；</p>
<p>懇切勸導少數作梗</p>
<p>該公司工潮，係於上月廿三日發生，工人未向公司提出要求，即實行怠工，經市黨部王委員先靑等，前往工廠勸導，未生效果。工人方面，並拒絕推派代表至市黨部及社會局調解，新任社會局吳局長開先就任後，以電力公司係公用事業，市府早有禁止公用事業工人怠工罷工命令，未可長此僵持，乃命令該廠工人，推派代表到局調處，三十日該廠推派歐陽祖潤·黃鴻勛等到局，其他五公用事業工會，亦各派代表共同勸導，經吳局長及社會部陸特派員京士等，懇切勸導後，勞資雙方意見已趨接近，歐陽等深受感動，表示決負全責，勸導工人復工，無如歐陽等於離社會局時，突然變卦，託詞拒絕其他五公用事業工會代表同往勸導，一面於返廠後，亦不召集全體工人會議，僅舉行理監事會，仍主張繼續怠工，並有人主張實行停電，以資要挾。</p>
<p>禁止行動工人怨忿</p>
<p>該公司自怠工以來，工會方面，即組織糾禁止工人出外，同時將全體工人編成小組，隨時點名，以防工人外出，大多數工人以廠內衣食不周，値此寒天，頗多因此病倒者，然以糾察隊嚴厲監視，行動不得自由，莫不怨忿異常，其有發表異見，主張復工者，即遭糾察隊毆打或當衆侮辱，甚至因神經刺激而發精神病者，工人家屬得悉後，紛請軍警機關予以解救。茲錄殷王氏楊樂氏等數十人於上月廿九日呈警備總司令部文如次：「查民等家屬，現在楊樹浦上海電力廠作工，於木月廿三日奉職工會命令，留廠怠工，現已六日夜，在廠晚間宿於水門汀上，更無被蓋，以致相　染病，罷工委員絕對禁止工人外出，即獲特計，亦僅限三二小時，實屬妨碍身體自由，爲此具文呈請鈞部設法予以解救，實爲德便。」</p>
<p>家屬請願發生衝突</p>
<p>令部據呈後，轉函市政府核辦，市府正交警察局查究時，乃昨日下午三時許，工人家屬百餘人，以工人怠工日久，身體已疲不堪，且年關已屆，亟待團聚，羣往楊樹浦該廠向工會請願，准工人返家，乃工會方面，仍堅決拒絕，廠內工人，至此忍無可忍，紛起反抗，致與糾察隊發生衝突，一時秩序稍形紊亂，致有二三人受傷。</p>
<p>警察彈壓工人獲釋</p>
<p>楊樹浦警察局離訊後，即派警前往彈壓，維持秋序，糾察隊竟不服制止，阻撓自願回家之工人，經警士將爲首者拘捕。至此廠內工人如獲大赦，率妻携子，欣然離廠返家。至發電引擎間內工人，仍留廠繼續工作，維持電力，一塲糾紛，遂得迅速解決，恢復秩序。又該工會主持人歐陽祖潤·黃鴻勛等二人，當時在社會局內談判，警局方面以歐陽等二人自始主使操縱，應負責任，亦一併予以拘捕，將依法於二十四小時內移送法院依法審理。</p>
<p>公司通告　迅速復工</p>

<p>市長說明處理經過</p>
<p>錢市畏昨夜爲電力公司工潮事發表談話，滋誌其原文如下：「本市電力公司職工因公司開除偸電工人沈涵一事，發起怠工、糾集各部份工人二千八百餘人聚集楊樹浦工廠，組織糾察隊，禁止各工人行動，妨害個人自由，該工人代表歐陽福潤，黃鴻勛等提出十一條要求，曾經社會局召集勞資雙方調解，資方邀令到塲，而工人等强朮資方負責人赴廠談判，抗不出席。迨新任社會局吳局長到職，一再剴切令飭復工，進行調解，該代表等雖遵令到塲，仍未轉告工人復工，一面提出種種不合理之請求，强資方接受，吳局長再三曉諭，責令復工，該代表等佯示服從，實則絕未遵行，三十日吳局長親自出席調解，該代表等表示接受，並面稱將負責開導遵令復工，當時其他五公用事業工人代表深爲感動，願同往開導，惟方離社會局即託調拒絕。據報回廠後，幷不召開大會，僅開理監事會反對復工。三十一日上午十時該工會理監事會，召集大會强迫工人不得回家，同時本府接到工人家屬股王氏楊樂氏等呈訴，請求營救被該工會糾察隊拘禁各工人，情辭迫切，同日下午據楊樹淸警察分局報告，當日下午三時後，工人家屬及親友等羣集工廠大門，請釋工人回家，一部份被禁工人，即欲外出，被糾察隊强力制止，致起糾紛等語。當令警局前往彈壓詎意該糾察隊竟不服制止，仍阻撓自願回家之工人，綜上種種違法行爲，當令飭警局將主使操縱工人之代表歐陽祖潤，黃鴻勛及在場擾亂秩序之人，一體拘捕，送請法院依法處辦。現被禁工人，均已分別圓廠回家或照常工作。</p>
<p>危害秩序　妨害自由</p>
<p>查市府此次對於電力公司工潮之措置，自工潮發生後，曾不憚再三努力調解，對工會所提要求，凡客觀認爲合理者，無不盡力勸導資方予以接受。同時勸告工人尊重國家法令，即日復工，無如政府雖苦心勸導，而電力公司工人不幸爲少數職工所操縱，不僅反復無常，而所提條件，層出不窮，該工人等自組所謂糾察隊，拘棻工人不准作工，又復阻撓軍警維持秩序，其行動越出法律範圍，不惟危害社會秩序，抑且直接妨害工人本身之自由，除本日逮捕各人立即移送法院依法辦理外，深盼該公司工人即速照常工作。至工人原提各項要求，仍當依法處理，木府對勞資爭議事件，向秉公正態度，依據法律程序，合理處理，決不偏袒，此後如有不依規定順序，擅自怠工罷工者，爲安定社會秩序，維持人民福利計，自當嚴格取締，勿稍寬貸。</p>

<p>（一）英文大美晚報工潮，昨已完全解決，晚報昨亦照常出版，此次勞資雙方談判經社會局派員調解，勞方所要求各點，資方原則均表接受。</p>

<p>（五）粤菜業之怠工風潮，以資方仍無答覆，昨日繼續發展，且又有虹口章記等數家自動加入，勞方爲謀早日解決起見，曾函職業工會促使資方恢復談判，但截至目前爲止，資方仍無表示，故今日當不能復工。</p>
<p>（六）中國化學工業社工人，要求年賞，昨日社會局由周天鵬召集雙方調解結果，因農歷年終不及決定，故由資方先借給男工侮名五萬元，女工四萬元，將在農歷年後再行決定數目。</p>

<p>軋石機器產量極大</p>
<p>廈門路機械廠是修理工務局一切車件，　路機，馬達，及　　工作的。裏面工作速度很迅速，一架壓路機正在裝修，完工後即可在築路時應用。</p>
<p>卡德路軋石廠內有三架軋石機，雖然已有廿多年的歷史，但效率仍相當可觀。大塊的石頭從蘇州，杭州，松江等各地運來後，就一塊塊的放在軋石機口，一發電後，軋石機橫放着的大鐵圓桶，就旋轉起來。圓桶壁分成一時半·一時·半時，及四分之一時·四種小洞，軋碎的石子，就按着大小從洞丙篩出來。這樣生產，每天可出一百立方公尺的石子。但消耗量非常驚人，工務局築路，修機，造屋的沙石，都由軋石廠內借給的。旁邊的柏油廠煉製柏油，馬路上修路掘出來的舊柏汕，並不是　掉的，柏油廠合來重新練過，所　渣子，還哥作其他用途。</p>
<p>清理污水工作完善</p>
<p>有許多人們一守以爲我們平時抽水馬桶中的汚物，一抽就通入陰溝流到河浜去了。其實，經過的情形還不是那末簡單。本市前法租界和公共租界的情形略有不同。法租界的弄堂或馬路旁，都有一圓形鐵蓋，這下面就是抽水馬桶汚物的積貯管。經過小型的調節後，固體往往蒸發成氣逃逸，液體就流入陰溝，通至河渠。在公共租界。目前有三個汚水淸理廠，狄斯威路北四川路一帶汚水，通至靶子路廠。河南路以東通至楊俗浦。河南路以西通到北新涇。這條路程共計長三十里，就是說住在河南路以西的排洩物，要經三十里長的路程通到北新涇。</p>
<p>固體污物可作肥料</p>
<p>在靜安寺路西摩路口人行道旁有一間漆着奶油色和綠色的小屋子，人們都莫明其妙，也許以爲是什麼電綫設置。原來這下面是總管的一個很大的積汚水站和唧筒。像這樣的設備，每隔三里路，就有一只。每抽水一次，需三加侖水，所以汚物到了下面，已成液體，經過積水站時，嘀筒就可將水提高，帮助前進，一直經過十次後，就到了北新涇淸理廠的最後大唧筒。那裏每天可打水四百萬加俞，打來的水，再通到十餘個水池內，經過發電機調節空氣的力量，一天二十四小時一刻不停的在流動。在冬天大概經過十五至十八小時後，汚水才可淸理到比較淸潔地步，通入另一水池內。再經過瀑布式的衝水就流入蘇州河，這樣就可避免汚物及　水流入河內，影響衛生。據說在夏季，汚水經過六小時的淸理後，就成極淸的水，比蘇州河內的水要淸潔數倍。至於剩下來的髒水，又另外流入許多池內，有三十多個池輪流沉澱晒乾，可供鄉人作種田肥料之用。這種肥料經化騐結果，比未淸理的更有養料。雨水則由溝渠內直通，已完成之雨水堰現有五次，最大的第六個麥根路水堰，正在修理，定六月底前完成。今年夏季的水患，即可因此而免。</p>
<p>最後參觀江灣其美路的鋸木廠，利用前日人用作做三夾板的機器來鋸實用木塊。大小分別，都有規定尺寸，平均每天可鋸木八千木尺，每木尺即爲一平方尺面積，一吋厚的木塊重三磅。工務局所用榏木等都是從道廠裏鋸出來的。</p>

<h3 id="c69">電力工潮的善後 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>上海電力公司工潮，僵持將及一旬，昨日下午方始告一段落，但仍不能謂爲業已完全解決。我們根據各方的報道，對於電力工潮的善後，願提供數點意見。</p>
<p>此次工潮，只要勞資雙方均能接受政府的調解，自始即易解決。所惜工會爲少數人所操縱，工人自由意志無由表現，卒致一般家屬，年近歲逼，要求工人回家，與「糾察隊」發生衝突，市府乃不能不爲斷然的處置。可見工人要求是否正當爲一事，而如何方可達到合理要求爲另一事。我們首先希望今後的電力工會應該懲前毖後，在法律軌道內，爲工友謀福利</p>
<p>電力公司願意進行調解的態度，無可厚非。惟據勞方表示，此次爭執之點，乃爲年資加薪不甚公允而起，其次則又說前此經社會局調解各點，有一部分資方延不實行。我們對條件內容，固未易率爾評判，惟須爲資方告者，加薪等事最宜公允，稍有不平，自易引起糾紛，而曾經調解接受的條件，尤當恪守履行，方可消弭工潮。故當局今後繼續調解時，資方萬不可以爲工人羣衆業已離廠，便可不再理會勞方之合理要求，而仍宜一秉守法立塲，服從政府之合理評斷。</p>
<p>最後，願向政府進一言。此次市府態度，公正調解，善盡勸導，而爲維持秩序，保障自由計，不得不依法處置。凡此，中外市民，均所稱譽。但願政府一方面迅將少數脅迫怠工和妨碍秩序的工人，移送法院依法審理，而另一方面仍應對勞方所提正當要求，秉公繼續調解，尤其希望有迅速而合理的解決。使社會人士及一般勞工，都能明瞭政府在合法範圍內無不維護勞工的利益、</p>

<p>美鈔以無軋空關係，趨勢不逮黃金之燦爛，且市傳新匯率日內發表，則可以投機之時期不致過久，設無黃金方面之套買，助長買氣，恐將回跌，晨開後曾降至一五八〇元以下，後以金市又起奔騰，套頭價拔開至六八〇元以上，一度回好至一六九〇元左右，午後又隨金市同吿回降，午後金價雖回升，美鈔以實貨傾出，仍管生色，結果較前收徴降十元，港票初疲後穩，新貨曾回跌至七〇元，最後略有回好，結果較前計老貨小五元，新貨小四元</p>

<p>歲尾年暮，各業均準備渡歲，黃金突起奔騰，漲風之烈可稱空前，所謂不鳴則已，一鳴驚人，揆其原因，我國古來習慣，勞作一年，對此遍歷年尾及新年，倍加重視，四鄉來客採辦年貨外，頗多向大同行銀樓兌換金飾，鑒於以前帶値之不安定，鄉農雖智識較淺，但對於數年來輕視紙幣之成見，與日俱增，偽幣折合法幣，物價不跌反漲，民間痛苦殊深，更加「孫票」謠傳，轉輾流布，一般婦女來自四鄉之客人，為辛勤所得之積蓄着想，紛向銀樓中謀保障，銀樓實銷一繁，自必想法向市塲補進，年來各種商業機構，頗多以黃金為資本，此種現象，尤以投機商為更普遍，　　來股債狂跳，投機商獲得數倍，屆此結算之期，盈餘所得，以及已動用之資金，勢必歸源，肌債漲起數位，金市則穩定未有大變，賺慣以倍數論之股債物價，對黃金漲度認為家常便飯，一有變動，自必爭先搶購，再則最近所謂金市有空頭大約七千餘條，此輩泰半鑒於金價一時無劇變可能，貿然拋金另購活躍喧赫之熱門股債，今者獲利不謂不厚，照理早應套轉，但因金價迄管苗頭，或則貪息價優厚，或則沉迷於股債，待機而動，日來投機高潮旣已轉變，大量買戶自必源源而來，　起軋空，自在意中，以上三點，乃金價上騰直接之主因，此外陪都金市收盤已越過掛牌賣價，引起赤金儲蓄劵到期不付現之揣測，「採票」對法幣定一千對一，大後方來客以前揣測，「採票」按戰事前法幣地位率固時對美匯率為三對一，舊事重又浮映，於是新匯率定二千或三千之揣測間接說得若有其事，各地金價高過本埠頗多，當局僅令海關禁運出口為對付，激動民間藏金觀念，遍歷新年在即，財政首長適在是時逗留京滬，僉認在此時間發表新匯率極為可能，法幣籌碼邇來市面頗開充斥，游資自謀出路，暴利主義下散戶惑於「紅盤」刺激，凡此皆為間接助漲黃金因素，至於謠傳若何，則見仁見智各有不同矣。</p>

<p>— 化石</p>
<p>生活的方式</p>
<p>聯大學生的生活方式，不外「跑」「擲」「搶」。跑字的意義及範圍，來得特別深遠，像「跑妞兒」，「跑警報」，「跑茶館」……本來一味讀書，生活不免單調，因此對異性的追求也像唸書似的緊張。「跑妞兒」有人說是戰時靑年消沈頹喪的表現，未免不近情理，應該特別提及的，他們對國是的關懷，是赤忱，是純潔，從戰時輸血，譯員應徴就可以明白了。</p>
<p>因着空襲頻　，跑警報確是一件麻煩事，炸得最凶時，每週要跑五六次，一跑就是整天，不得不將上課的時間提早或改晚，聯大會兩度被狂炸，圖書館教室，男女生宿舍都中了彈，華羅庚先生曾被炸彈捲起的泥土掩沒，幸被救出，多年來昆明雖遭慘炸，但師友死傷極少，可說一大幸事。某一暑假中，學校被炸，梅先生親自提着省油燈，日夜趕修，本能如期開課，可證明他們辦學的精神了。</p>
<p>提到「跑茶館」，每一聯大師友是永遠忘懷不了那條終日馬糞栖栖，終日馬糞高揚的鳳　街的。鳳　街，多好聽的街名，它一方面顯示出中國農村的破產，中國農人的貧窮，另一方面，從茶館　托出學術界苦撐的精神，那襤襖大脖子的鄉下佬，趕着騾驢，背上掮着一捆笨重的松柴，氣吁吁地從鄉下趕進城，騾驢的嘴邊，套上一個裝潢乾草或高粱的蔴布袋，邊嚼邊走。趕馬的身旁，緊着一個裝潢又粗又糙，沒有一根青菜，沒有半點鹽巴，污黑得像馬草似的包穀　飯，邊嚼邊走。我們不知道到底馬嚼的是人吃的糧食，還是人嚼的是馬吃的糧食。中國人固然窮苦，但應痛哭的說，雲南的鄉下人更窮苦，然而在窮苦鏡頭刺激下，聯大的師友，不管馬糞的味道，不管銅鈴和馬蹄　的　　，三五成　的挾着書，往茶館裏一跑，把書攤開，高興時買點花生米慢吞吞的嚼嚼老闆娘泡一杯清茶，擺出一碟松子，最初時，她們不大歡迎專為看書來泡茶，後來到茶館看書的一天多一天，她們知道並不妨碍生意，也就相安了。記得羅文幹先生常常和法律系的同學，到茶館講羅馬法，有誰他是一們曾僕僕風塵的知名人物呢！那德籍猶太人，曾為希特勒放逐的熟悉滇西地形地質的米士先生，和淡定生探測歸來，有時也在鳳　街坐上一兩個鍾頭。米士生活奇苦，極度用功，不知道外國學者仍在昆明沒有？也許他回到來因河去重溫破碎的家園了。「擠」和「搶」，有時雙管齊下，敎室的座位有限，有時要搶。圖書館一到開館，前十分鍾，成百的同學，擠在門口，門一開，蜂擁的擠進去，爭先佔座位。閱覽室的必修書籍極少，門一開，潮水似的擠進去搶書，搶了座位的，搶不了書，搶了書的，搶不了座位，必須兩人合作，才能收雙臂之效。不過，女同學有時例外，因為許多保駕的早就替她們搶好了，聽說擠搶的風氣，近年來已加了改善，不然，平價米所發出的熱量，是經不起幾跑幾擠幾搶的。</p>
<p>戰時的貢獻</p>
<p>八年來的聯大，經費雖然艱窘，教授雖然分期，學生雖然營養不足，但它對祖國，八年來血戰的祖國，直接或間接，盡了應盡的使命。它，保存了學術自由的學風，如果中國成為嶄新的民主國家，學術自由是可以促進民主的。當抗戰以前，雲南的水準，趕不上江浙湘諸省的，學生的程度那麼淺，辦學的人那麼敷衍，它，在昆八載，和雲南教育當局合辦進修班，提高師資，且畢業同學一部分從事中學教育，使貧乏的中學注入新血液。特別在招攷新生時，最初幾年雲南學生在聯大的寥寥無幾，設在雲南的有歷史的大學，雲南籍學生那樣少，這刺激了他們的急起直追。人這一層，聯大對雲南是有特殊貢獻的。當滇西軍事緊張，聯大師生在人心運動時，弦歌不絕，這對穩定後方是有影響的。當政府決定和英美交換教授時聯大的金龍　，陳寶絡，朱汝華，羅孝田，陳序經，饒　泰諸教授，曾先後出國講學，這對於學術合作上多多少少有些力量。當軍中需要翻譯迫切時，聯大首倡集體徴調，這　有為的靑年，出入槍林彈雨，痺癘　疾，和螞蝗蚊蟲酷暑陣雨搏鬥，用精力生命幸印美軍隊的感情，加速戰爭的勝利。當昆明血庫成立時，聯大師友踴躍輸血，缺乏營養的學生，造成了輸血的最高紀錄，確為抗戰中的佳話。他們為了政治新生，國家團結，用最高的熱忱，致最大的關切，也盡了它最大力量。</p>
<p>離開昆明三年了，我懷念昆明，我懷念母校，它將自由的傳統的學風，從戰前轉到戰時，再轉到戰後，從北方的文化城展開到西南的山地。它在風雨飄零中，度過艱難的歲月，本能發榮滋長。它行將成為上的名詞，但它的精神永遠長留，它所造就出來的，將持續它一貫的精神的人　，為眞理奮鬥，呵！母校，可愛的母校！三十五年一月十九日於重慶</p>

<p>黑　從四面八方趕來的時候，路燈却分外明亮了。</p>
<p>夜的幽音，風聲的交響，誰高興聽呢？那間遊着的人們，都不期地踱入迷人的「樂園」，哀哀的「後庭花」勾引着它的同情者：商人來了，扶老携幼來了，人力車來了，三輪車來了，汽車幣着耀武揚威的大肚子，八字　也來突。</p>

<p>— 宋牧</p>
<p>我們住在漁街子的時候，生活裏難得有什麽新鮮，祗是侮禮拜僅有的兩次趕街子才使我們從平靜單調的日子裹掘發出來，嘗到一絲活發的興奮的氣息。</p>
<p>碰到趕街子的那天，我們常是起得很早，天還才蒙蒙亮就摸索着爬起來了，我們担心着也許會去得晚了，屋子裘充滿着生氣，愉快地笑着，精神裏顯得少有的煥發。</p>
<p>我們是很不必担心壞天氣的，山城的日子永遠那麽晴朋柔和，情晨的田野裏漫着白色的霧，濃烈的泥土氣息四下沁開來，郊徑上靑草結着露珠，圓涔涔地，朝頭上瞧，淡灰的天空上有粒粒晨星　着眼。</p>
<p>街子離我們的住處不遠，穿過一排密生的灌木叢就能望着一簇簇擁擠的人頭，街子建築在一塊平壩上，那後面是一堵黃泥墻，當初據說是什麼私人的輾坊，但現在除了那座快傾圯的泥墻外，是什麽也看不見了，我們這個村裏本來住不上幾份人家，平常的日子總是冷淸淸的，難得看見一兩個人影，但一到今天却你奇蹟似地都鎭出來－，大人，孩子，他們平常或看見過一兩面或者就從沒碰見過，但當頭撞住了，照例交換一個親切的微笑，或者和氣地答訕着：</p>
<p>「你家請早呀！」</p>
<p>對方于是也和悅地打着招呼將肘上撈着的笆斗高高地揚起來，或者他是有意要向說話的人顯示點什麼，從布兜裏掏出幾個鷄蛋向對方讚美地說：</p>
<p>「今天街子上的鷄蛋眞要得，又大又便宜，你家道一卑上都買點啥子呀？」</p>
<p>他還沒說完這話，已經爲後來的人簇擁到人堆裏去了，本就够小的土壩突然增多這麽些人就更顯得擁擠了，做買賣的大聲吆喝着，肉販子故意將刀柄敲着銅罐可噹噹響，招徠着主顧，他們做生意都是那麼充滿和氣，他們之間當然也有時爭執，但一有人勸解馬上就會從臉上冽出一堆笑來，你看他們是那麽做着交易的</p>
<p>「黨權的，給稱四兩肉，要後座。」</p>
<p>「要得，你家瞧，道肉是今天從南鄉帶上來的，要多新鮮有多新鮮。」</p>
<p>「你秤垂上就給放寬點。」</p>
<p>「你家放心，再加你一點，老主顧的交易。」</p>
<p>末了買的人接過來滿意地笑了，他淡淡地向掌櫃的：</p>
<p>掌櫃的，今天荷包不使閒，賒在帳上，二天再還給你」。</p>
<p>那個像被羞辱似地馬上搖着手：</p>
<p>「你家說那裏話？唉，四兩肉算個唯子，今天就算我請你，要不要得？」</p>
<p>鄉下人就有股那麽質樸勁，街子收塲得很平，等太陽高高地昇在天空時，趕街子的人大都將笆斗裏塞得滿滿地帶着笑歸去了，土壩上慢慢又恢復往日的沉靜，下午有時當我們從那兒走過時祇看見有一兩個孩子在喜戲外，地上留着早晨遺剩的菜皮，除此以外，我們是很難想像先會熙　的情形來了，我們又得在平枯的日子裏待上幾天，我們在企盼着下回的街子，能早點到來。</p>
<h3 id="c102">安靜 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 慕容隨</p>
<p>科學家發明了物質不滅的原則以後，從醫學上絞盡了腦汁·結果至今還沒有方法將人類從死亡的大道上拯救出來！</p>
<p>宗敎家早　定了這一點，他逆知了科學家的失敗，他於是乎從宗敎上去費盡了腦力，可是成仙成道究竟還是大海撈針，他便想到多製造幾杯甜蜜的醇酒，使人們意識迷糊地走上那死亡的大道上去，減少一點臨死的痛苦！</p>
<p>至今還沒方法能將這可憐的人類們拔出於死亡之外，他們當然都沒有什麽理由可以掩飾他們的失敗了！</p>
<p>然而醫學界還是握緊着那一根很細的繩子，誇耀着他的萬能，其實道根繩子僅僅能使人在死亡的邊界上「多住幾天」而已；而僧侶們呢，也還是捧着那杯醇酒，誇耀着他的萬能，其實這杯酒，正好像似對臨刑的囚徒「給予酒食」一般聊資壯胆而已。</p>
<p>眞正使我們有點覺得厭倦了！然而科學家至今還捧着「物質不滅」的死人骨頭在啃；宗敎家也至今還釘着「不生不滅」的厚皮在鑽！</p>
<p>我想道一羣啃骨頭鑽厚皮的人，還是及早安靜一點吧讓那些可憐的人類們，可以安靜一點去躺下。</p>

<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>這情形使墨老爺省悟到剛才的話，是對一個孩子不利的。同時，又怕他等會兒去告訴了墨太太。於是連忙勉强鎭靜地安慰寳鈴說：</p>
<p>「不哭，孩子，爸爸剛才是胡說亂道，跟你開扯着玩兒的，可千萬別告訴你媽！』</p>
<p>「不！爸爸！我懂。」寳鈴搖搖頭唏噓地說。他這是告訴墨老爺：關干墨老爺的雙層意思他都懂。而且這些話，便深深影響了他的後來。</p>
<p>「那麼，乖乘地擦擦眼淚，出去玩兒吧！」</p>
<p>寳鈴答應着出去了。墨老爺在屋裏散了一會子步，這時心裏好像舒服點兒。而且爲了喪鈴的懂事，隱隱感到些快慰。不禁悄悄對自己說：「只要寳鈴成器，就沒白活一場！」因此，從此他便把寳鈴當作唯一的生之寄託，生之希望。</p>
<p>墨盛提着一瓶酒，回來告訴墨老爺：翁老爺隨後就到。墨老爺于是又興緻起來，便吩咐墨盛：叫預備些下酒的菜，他要和翁老爺對酌一番。</p>
<p>沒有多大工夫，翁老爺就來了。</p>
<p>翁老爺像是才睡醒的樣子，一個勁兒地打着呵欠走進書房裏。</p>
<p>「怎麼，老兄弟的癮，還沒過足嗎？」墨老爺迎上去說。</p>
<p>「是過足了，只是覺還沒睡足。你知道，墨雄去的時候，我正在作夢哩！」翁老爺說罷坐下來。從袖筒裏抖搜出一隻白銅小烟袋，「呼嚕呼嚕」地抽起來。</p>
<p>「這樣說，我打擾了您的淸夢！眞是抱歉的很！」墨老爺邊說，邊向外面嚷着：」沏一壺熱茶來呀！」</p>
<p>「聽墨感說大哥今兒有「弄璋之禧」，可賀！可賀！」翁老爺說着，從嘴裏噴出雲霧，而且津津有味地看着那一股股裊裊淸烟，旋忽間又化爲烏有。</p>
<p>「正是爲這個，才請您來對酌。因爲家裹沒有好酒，記得前兒在府上喝的五加皮挺好，所以叫墨盛告訴您順便帶來。趕明兒我托人到漢口去買幾瓶，再還給您」墨老爺這樣說着，有些怪難爲情的。其實他是沒有錢買酒。特別在今天，他不能去向太太討錢買酒喝。</p>
<p>「哪兒的話！大哥喜歡五加皮，回頭我再送您兩瓶，橫豎家裏還多，我的酒量又不大，放在那兒，也可惜了兒的。」</p>
<p>這句話使墨老爺高興得立刻有精神了！他愛酒，酒幾乎變成了他的第二生命。這一年以來，如果不是酒常常麻醉了他，他可能一天都活不下去！酒使他忘記過去；酒使他不想到將來；酒使他目前涎臉厚顏地茗延着；酒救了他，也害了他！如果有人問他：是願意因酒而損傷健康，早死呢？還是願意戒酒而保持健康，多活些年？他一定會毫不猶豫地回答你：情願因酒早死，不情願戒酒多活。所以，凡關其它的事，墨太太命令他改，他都遵從，唯獨「戒酒」一樣，他堅次抗議。任憑墨太太如何駡，甚而有一次把家裹所有的酒壺酒杯都砸了，他也還照樣抱着酒瓶，酒　子飲。再不然，他就溜出去坐酒館，他手上僅有的一隻綠翠戒指，就是爲了喝酒賣掉的。這件事始終墨太太不知道。終墨太太不知道。</p>

<h3 id="e2">Group Reports Unanimously Passed <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st] The Political Consultative Conference, after concluding the work of the National Assembly group at the last subgrouping on the 31st, held its tenth meeting at the National Government Auditorium at 6:30 PM, presided over by Chairman Chiang, to discuss the reports of the various subcommittees, all of which were unanimously passed. At today's meeting, 37 members, including Sun Ke, attended. After Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported the number of attendees, Chairman Chiang declared the meeting open to discuss the reports of the subcommittees on government organization, policy guidelines, military affairs, the National Assembly, and the draft constitution. Before the discussion of each report, two secretaries read them aloud. The Chairman then invited members to express their opinions. All resolutions were quickly and unanimously passed. Only Huang Yanpei, Zhang Lisheng, Dong Biwu, and Li Zhuchen made brief explanations regarding the Outline for Peaceful National Reconstruction. Mo Dehui, Fu Sinian, and Huang Yanpei expressed their opinions on the constitutional draft issue. Fu and Huang suggested that it be recorded and submitted to the Constitutional Draft Review Committee for study. After the reports of the various subcommittees were passed, Chairman Chiang stood up and explained the following two points: (1) The phrase "to form a revised draft of the May 5th Constitution to provide for adoption by the National Assembly," as stated in the report of the Constitutional Draft Group, may be misunderstood by outsiders. In reality, it does not affect the powers of the National Assembly. The National Assembly is not subject to any restrictions when exercising its due powers. However, the review committee should fully study it in preparation for adoption by the National Assembly. (2) The resolutions and policy guidelines passed by this conference are national in scope. All regions of the country, regardless of area or party affiliation, must abide by them. They should be equally effective in all provinces and districts and in the areas where the Communist forces are stationed, in order to achieve national unity of military orders and political orders, and to firmly establish the foundation for peaceful national reconstruction. The above two points are specifically explained, and it is hoped that the conference participants will convey them to the attention of the compatriots throughout the country. After the Chairman finished speaking, he declared the conference successfully concluded and then held the closing ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Mao Zedong May Go to Nanjing, Zhou Enlai to Tour <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 31st] The Central Standing Committee held a meeting today, presided over by Chairman Chiang, and immediately passed the various resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. At the same time, a spokesperson for the Democratic League quoted Zhou Enlai as saying that CCP Chairman Mao Zedong may attend the State Council, and Mao will go to Nanjing when the council is established there. Zhou will also tour the areas controlled by the CCP to inform the public of the various resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and encourage them to support it.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Disagreement on Railway Traffic Restoration; Difficulty in Completing Repairs by Deadline <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] It seems that the cessation of conflict issue may soon be resolved. The current focus of the Executive Headquarters' work has shifted to restoring traffic, but there is still a significant gap between the opinions of the government and the CCP. The government advocates unified management of national railways, with order along the lines maintained by railway police. The Communist side expresses doubts about the neutrality of the railway police and advocates segmented management and segmented protection of the railway. As of now, there is no sign of convergence in the opinions of the two sides. Except for the Jinan area, where road repairs have begun, the repair teams dispatched to other lines are still staying at the construction sites, waiting for the two sides to reach an agreement before they can start work. Chairman Chiang once set a deadline of the end of February for the repair of the railways, but due to practical difficulties, it is uncertain whether traffic can be restored by then. The most difficult problem at present is the lack of sleepers. Because many sleepers have been dismantled and burned, it is impossible to import a large number of ready-made sleepers from abroad in a short period of time. Under the current situation where the government's political orders only extend to a few cities, it is also impossible to collect them from the countryside, which is extremely difficult. Although the demand for rails reaches 500 kilometers, most of them have not been destroyed and are easy to find. Furthermore, by dismantling the rails of unimportant branch lines, it can be barely managed. Fortunately, neither of the major bridges on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines have been destroyed. Although many locomotives have been bombed, they can still be barely allocated. In terms of personnel, the 6,000-7,000 members of the original Japanese field railway unit have been concentrated in Changxindian, Shijiazhuang, and Tianjin by the war zone after the ceasefire order and disarmed separately. There is currently a significant shortage of personnel. It is reported that the United States will send 300 railway engineers to China, which may solve some of the senior technical problems in the future. Ling Hongxun, who is exhausted from his travels, once told people that we have not yet obtained a single steel rail or a single sleeper from abroad. The difficulty in repairing the old roads is actually greater than building a new one.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Plague Rampant in Northeast <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>

According to Chu Xichun, the commander of the northern Shanxi garrison in the Second War Zone, Fengzhen is currently the garrison area of the Communist army. The power supply there is provided by Datong. The Datong side is currently repairing and connecting the power lines to meet the power needs of Fengzhen. An atmosphere of peace has filled the Datong area.

Qi Mengchun, the deputy officer of this headquarters, passed through the Communist-occupied area from Datong to Wuyuan on the 27th to work. This is the first time that our military officers have openly passed through the Communist area after the cessation of conflict.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] A reporter who went to Jining with the peace team said upon returning that there was no gunfire or damage to traffic in Suiyuan. The Suiyuan-Baotou road is smooth and traffic is unimpeded between Guihua and Jining. The railway is being repaired. Since the arrival of the executive team in Suiyuan, everything has improved significantly, and the prospects for peace are quite optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Chairman Chiang's Closing Remarks: Harmony and Coordination - The Conference Achieved a Complete Success; Utmost Sincerity and Frankness - Political Disputes Will Be Thoroughly Eliminated <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st] Chairman Chiang, on the 31st, delivered a speech at the closing of the Political Consultative Conference. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Esteemed Members, Since the opening of the Political Consultative Conference, after more than twenty days of passionate discussions, it has completed its due tasks. Today, it is declared closed. I, in my official capacity, have been unable to personally attend every meeting to exchange opinions with you all, for which I feel deeply apologetic. Looking back on these twenty-odd days, whether in group discussions or plenary sessions, all members have been able to be open and frank, adhering to the spirit of mutual respect, mutual trust, mutual assistance, and cooperation, seeking reasonable solutions to various problems based on a pragmatic approach. This has allowed the conference to consistently maintain an atmosphere of harmony and coordination, achieving complete success, which is the most valuable outcome of this conference. I sincerely hope that this spirit of public duty and frankness can be maintained forever. If everyone avoids contention and does not prioritize personal opinions, but wholeheartedly works together for the country and its people, then all the decisions of this conference will be smoothly implemented. In the future, pointless political disputes will be thoroughly eliminated, the goal of peaceful nation-building will be quickly achieved, and the prospects for the future implementation of constitutional government will therefore become even brighter. This is my extremely joyful feeling at the close of the conference today, and I must express my gratitude to all of you.</p>
<p>The Only Important Issue Currently: Ensuring Unification and Establishing Democracy</p>
<p>Originally, the purpose of our National Revolution was to complete the construction of the Three Principles of the People and create an independent, free, unified, and democratic country, especially to unite and strive to achieve the goal of peaceful nation-building. As for the targets of the National Revolution, externally, it was to eliminate imperialist aggression; internally, it was to overthrow feudal separatism. In the past, overthrowing the Manchu Qing, eliminating warlords, and in the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, working diligently and struggling arduously, the sole purpose was to seek independence and unification, first removing obstacles to democracy in order to complete the realization of a democratic system. Now, the work of removing revolutionary obstacles and laying the foundation for democracy has been initially successful. The only important issue we face currently is how to ensure unification and how to establish democracy. In other words, it is how to realize the Three Principles of the People. We must understand that only with genuine unification can there be genuine democracy. I believe that from now on, there will be no privately owned armed forces or separate local regimes within our country to hinder the unification of political and military orders. Otherwise, no matter how loudly we proclaim democracy, what is actually manifested will be a false democracy where everyone acts in their own way, or even completely anti-democratic actions. Such a false democracy can never embark on the path of democratic constitutionalism, and will forever be an obstacle to democratic politics. Therefore, in order to realize genuine democracy and genuine unification, the two conditions of peace and unity are indeed our most urgent needs.</p>
<p>Unification, Democracy, Peace, and Unity: The Four Major Principles Are Held As Creeds</p>
<p>Because of the Founding Father's deathbed testament, "Strive for peace to save China," I personally and the comrades of the Chinese Nationalist Party have always adhered to this lofty instruction. Except for using force to resist separatist warlords and aggressive Japan, for all other domestic issues, no matter what serious situation we encountered, we always held firm to the determination to endure for the sake of the country, not hesitating to compromise and seek political solutions. Even if military conflicts were unavoidable, they were only passive defense, and we never took proactive actions. This is because we believe that our national strength and the people's strength can only be maintained and nurtured in stability, and cannot withstand any further devastation of war. Therefore, we have been able to transform discord into harmony in every moment of crisis, and even conflicting opinions have been able to converge and return to peace and unity. These past experiences, especially the facts of the eight years since the War of Resistance, are well known to the people of the country and need no further elaboration. This is the spirit of unification, democracy, peace, and unity that we advocate today. And this Political Consultative Conference was conducted based on the four major principles of unification, democracy, peace, and unity, so all proposals have credible and feasible decisions. I want to frankly say that this is indeed the victorious result of the cultivation and nurturing of the spirit of the National Revolution over the past fifty years in China, which can bring boundless comfort to the countrymen who have endured suffering and urgently need recuperation. I hope that we all hold these four major principles as our creeds forever, and always abide by and work together towards these creeds, so that we can comfort the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed for the War of Resistance and not betray the expectations of the people of the country.</p>
<p>Sincere Consultations on Decisions on Various Cases: The Government Should Implement Them Separately</p>
<p>On the day the conference opened, the government issued an order to cease military conflicts nationwide and restore transportation. Government representatives and representatives of the Communist Party of China also announced the measures agreed upon on January 5th, and at the same time announced all of the order's content and its four attached regulations, to demonstrate the determination to comply consistently. On the second day of the conference, government representatives and representatives of the Communist Party of China reported in detail to the conference, so that the conference could concentrate on studying various plans for peaceful nation-building and promoting constitutionalism. Although I have not been able to attend and participate in every session of the conference, I have been paying attention to and studying at all times, and I feel that the content of each plan is the crystallization of everyone's sincere consultations. I dare to state on behalf of the government that the government will definitely respect them, and will implement them separately according to the plans after completing the prescribed procedures. I believe that among all the proposals, the Program for Peaceful Nation-Building is the basic core of various plans, because the various provisions of the nine chapters of this plan, from General Principles (甲), People's Rights (乙), Politics (丙), Military Affairs (丁), Diplomacy (戊), Economy and Finance (己), Education and Culture (庚), Post-War Relief (辛), and Overseas Chinese Affairs (壬), are all unusually complete, truly meet the requirements of the times, are full of unity, and are full of democracy. It is truly the most suitable program for transitioning to the constitutional period. With this program, governments from the central to all local areas in the country, all parties, factions, and social leaders, and all compatriots across the country have a common standard to follow. In particular, all the parties and factions participating in this conference have jointly discussed and agreed upon this program and will participate in the government to jointly implement it. We must be trustworthy and responsible to the people of the country, starting with our own practical actions, and must implement its national character so that it can be universally realized.</p>
<p>Political Parties Should Organize Openly and Should No Longer Use Armed Uprisings</p>
<p>I believe there are two things that we must pay special attention to and solemnly declare: First, since this program stipulates that "ensuring that people already enjoy freedom of body, thought, religion, belief, speech, publication, assembly, association, residence, movement, and communication," all current wartime laws that conflict with this principle will, of course, be revised or abolished by the central government. At the same time, I believe that within the areas where the Communist Party of China's troops are stationed, they will certainly comply with this program, lifting all existing restrictions. As for education and culture, it is also stipulated that "academic freedom is guaranteed, and school administration shall not be interfered with by religion or political thought," which is very important for the development of our country's education and culture and for creating a good environment for young people. In the future, for their own protection, only laws that comply with this program should be enforced throughout the country, and there should no longer be any differences or special measures. Then, in the future, the activities of various political parties, even their competition for political power, can be organized and conducted openly in accordance with the legitimate rights and procedures that national unified laws should have, and there should no longer be any acts of using armed uprisings or secret organizations in various places. Otherwise, it would be losing the essence of a political party, destroying the spirit of democracy, violating this program, and hindering the process of constitutional government. If we are to be worthy of being political parties in a democratic country, we must eradicate all the past bad phenomena of all political parties since the founding of the Republic and only then will we have the hope of building a modern country.</p>
<p>The Implementation of Military Reorganization Must Be Thorough, and Military and Political Personnel Must Strictly Comply</p>
<p>Second, Chapter Ding (Military Affairs) of this program is extremely practical in its purpose and regulations regarding the nationalization of the military. In addition, there is a more detailed military plan that has been negotiated through the military group. I think that since we urgently need peace and unification, the military part of the program is the greatest element in consolidating peace and completing unification. The government has already made decisions on the issue of military reorganization and is implementing them. The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Military Affairs has also reported in detail to this conference, and will continue to promote it in accordance with the provisions of the program and plan in the future. As for the reorganization of the Communist Party of China's troops, it will naturally also be thoroughly reorganized in accordance with the program and plan. Originally, the unification of military administration and military orders is a necessary basic condition for establishing a country. This is not only the unanimous demand of compatriots throughout the country who have suffered greatly, but also the principle repeatedly declared by all parties, which is considered undeniable. Now that the Consultative Conference has results and the main points have been agreed upon, our most urgent task at present is to ensure that all military forces across the country, regardless of party affiliation or region, can obey the government's command, so as to achieve the standard of unifying military orders, military administration, and the military system as stipulated in the program. I dare to firmly believe that this is something that everyone agrees with, and there will be no exceptions. Only by truly achieving this can we meet the requirements of nation-building and comfort the people's aspirations. Otherwise, not only is there no meaning for everyone to participate in the government, but peace and unity will also have no foundation, and instead increase the crisis of the country and the entanglement within the government. This is certainly not what the country and the people need, nor is it the sincere intention of all members and all political parties to plan for the country. The two points mentioned above are indeed the key to whether this program can be fully implemented. If they can be thoroughly achieved, the order of the country will immediately stabilize, the work of rehabilitation can be smoothly completed, and the other chapters and articles of this program can also be easily solved and fully implemented. This is the undeniable responsibility of the colleagues of this conference. Today, with the most sincere sincerity, I especially draw everyone's attention, and at the same time, I personally vow to faithfully abide by this program, and I must supervise our military and political personnel at all levels to strictly comply with it. Even if unintentional mistakes or inadequate supervision are unavoidable at times, as long as everyone explains and points them out, neither I myself nor my subordinates will fail to sincerely accept and earnestly correct them. I often say, "To demand freedom, one must first understand the nature of freedom. One must not only care about one's own freedom and infringe on the freedom of others. To advocate democracy, one must first cultivate the habit of the rule of law. One must not only expect others to abide by the law, but oneself must place oneself outside the law everywhere." These few words of mine are truly based on the vague understanding of freedom and democracy and the weak awareness of the rule of law in our country's society. Without social stability, there is no foundation for the country. If the people do not value the rule of law, all kinds of evils will inevitably be carried out in the name of democracy and freedom. Therefore, my words above are indeed a heartfelt appeal. Especially in recent years, the morbid state manifested in society and the educational field is even more profound and significant. If this is not improved for a long time, our China will not be able to stand on its own among modern nations. Members must also have the same feeling. Now our Political Consultative Conference has agreed on the Program for Peaceful Nation-Building. This program is dedicated to protecting democratic freedom and aims to establish a peaceful, unified country under the rule of law. In order to exert the practical effect of this conference and create a scale for nation-building, we must first take on the responsibility of changing the atmosphere ourselves, establish the spirit of abiding by the law, and serve as a model for the people of the country. Only then can we fulfill our mission to history and the times.</p>
<p>The Great Cause of Nation-Building Begins Today: Together We Bear a Great Responsibility for the Future of the Nation</p>
<p>Finally, I want to take advantage of the opportunity today, when the conference has been completed and everyone has gathered together, to simply state to you what I have accumulated in my heart for many years but have not said. Personally, Zhongzheng has not been interested in politics since childhood. My lifelong ambition and career have been to dedicate myself to the National Revolution in order to save the country and its people. From the Xinhai Revolution to the present victory of the War of Resistance, I have participated in all the revolutionary battles in these thirty-five years. I have experienced all kinds of difficulties and hardships, and I have not failed to fulfill my revolutionary aspirations and the revolutionary obligations that I should have fulfilled. I can comfort myself that I have done my part for the country and the people. Today, although I cannot say that the National Revolution has been completely successful, the work of removing revolutionary obstacles has indeed come to an end. From now on, the country will completely enter the period when the great cause of nation-building begins. However, after our country's vitality has been depleted, the dangers to the country's future and the difficulties of the cause of nation-building are only more serious than before the war or even during the war. I am really filled with trepidation. Fortunately, this Political Consultative Conference has formulated the Program for Peaceful Nation-Building and various related plans. The initial foundation for nation-building has been laid, and the implementation of constitutional government is in sight. In the future, the core members of all parties and factions, as well as social elites, will participate in the government and jointly shoulder the great responsibility for the future of the country and the nation. In the future, the burden of nation-building will not be the responsibility of the Nationalist Party alone, let alone the responsibility of Zhongzheng personally. This major responsibility will be entrusted to all colleagues and compatriots across the country to jointly bear. In the future, whether Zhongzheng is in or out of office, I will abide by all the resolutions of this conference faithfully and firmly in accordance with the responsibilities that a citizen should fulfill, and ensure the consistent sincerity of peace and unity, urging our country to embark on the bright path of unified democracy, in order to repay the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed for the War of Resistance and to complete the unfinished achievements of the Founding Father in creating the Republic. At the same time, I ask all colleagues to work together for the country and the people, taking the spirit of sharing weal and woe during the War of Resistance, with one heart and one mind, and uniting sincerely, to shoulder the heavy responsibility of nation-building in the future. Open up a bright and brilliant future for our country and nation! (End)</p>

The Soviet Union's complaint that British military actions in Greece and East India endanger peace. The resolution of this case is based on the Soviet Union, as neither Greece nor East India has filed a complaint. Soviet radio has accused Britain of imposing "political oppression" on Greece.

<p>[United Press, London, 30th] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations Staff Meeting, headed by Shang Zhen, arrived here today. Sun Liren, the commander of the First Army which fought in Burma, is also among them.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 31st] Since the Security Council resolved to remove the Iranian-Soviet issue from the agenda and have the countries concerned negotiate directly, representatives of various countries have praised this, believing that this is the initial achievement of the Security Council and a good omen for the smooth development of the Council. Some parties had expressed pessimism, believing that the United Nations organization was just a successor to the League of Nations, but since the publication of the above resolution, this view has been dispelled. This resolution is called a "half compromise" because the United Nations organization retains the right to intervene in negotiations at any time, while also preserving the "face" of the relevant parties, namely the Soviet Union, Iran, Britain, and the United Nations organization.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Xu Zhaoyong, London, 30th Dispatch] During the Security Council meeting of the United Nations this afternoon, the Acting Chief Representative of China, Mr. Gu Weijun, expressed the opinion of our delegation on the Iranian issue. Mr. Gu urged the Council to handle this matter with extreme caution, as this is the first issue submitted to the Council within the scope of Chapter VI of the Charter, and is related to the resolution of disputes in the Pacific region. Mr. Gu stated that both the Soviet Union and Iran have expressed their willingness to continue to adopt bilateral negotiations to seek a solution. Based on the clear wishes of both parties, the Council should support this approach. The Chinese delegation deeply hopes that the Soviet Union and Iran will reach an agreement through negotiations. The Chinese delegation believes that Iran's request for the Council to put forward suggestions for negotiation is unnecessary, because such measures are only justified when one of the two parties indicates disagreement with the negotiation process. If so, the Council may discuss the issue of putting forward suggestions. Mr. Gu concluded by saying that he was deeply impressed by the sincerity of the Soviet representative's efforts to promote negotiations, and agreed with the suggestion made by the U.S. representative that the Council should be notified of the situation and results of the bilateral negotiations. French Representative Bidault agreed with Mr. Gu's opinion, saying that the Council should reserve the right to consider this matter at any time in case the negotiations fail, while also paying attention to the wishes of both parties to conduct negotiations, and allowing the Soviet Union and Iran to negotiate freely.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, January 30th] According to sources within the Military Affairs Committee: the committee brought back from Hiroshima hundreds of remains of Japanese people killed by the atomic bomb, ranging in age from young to old. Some were instantly vaporized by the blast, others died from severe injuries. Military scientists here are already dissecting them to learn more about the effects of atomic energy on the human body and to study whether there are effective treatments for such injuries. In addition, the committee also brought back hundreds of blood samples from survivors who were injured but not killed, as well as other medical records. Detailed records were also kept on 16,000 people who were within the bombed area, or in the immediate vicinity, who were either unharmed or recovered from their injuries. According to Colonel Ash, director of the Army Pathology Institute, "What we want to know is, what effect does the radiation released by the atomic bomb have on human cells and tissues? Perhaps it has a very significant impact on human tissue, especially bone marrow. But perhaps the radiation is completely different from other types of energy we currently know, and its impact on the human body is also completely different."</p>
<h3 id="e26">Severe Rice Shortage in Vietnam <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, January 30th Special Dispatch] The rice shortage in Northern Vietnam has reached a critical stage. It is generally expected that without immediate and active remedies, a large number of people will die of starvation. According to a 1936 French survey, the population of the Tonkin region was approximately eight million. The annual rice production from 2.3 million mu of cultivated land was barely enough to feed the population. However, over the past four years, the Japanese forced farmers to switch to growing ramie, reducing the area of rice paddies. The severe cold in the spring of 1945 greatly affected the winter harvest and spring planting, leading to an unprecedented famine. According to Vietnamese statistics, two million people died of starvation at that time, while the French claimed the death toll was 800,000. Unfortunately, last summer's continuous rain caused widespread flooding in the low-lying areas of Northern Vietnam, inundating one-third of the cultivated land. Before the floodwaters receded, drought followed, drastically reducing the harvest. According to statistics from the non-governmental Vietnamese Disaster Relief Association, Northern Vietnam will be short 850,000 tons of grain in the next three months. Although the Vietnamese government has ordered food rationing and grain transfers to provide relief, it will be impossible to remedy the impending severe food shortage.</p>
<h3 id="e27">China's Eight Years of War of Resistance: Greatest Contribution, US Lend-Lease Aid to China: Approximately $600 Million <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, January 31st] President Truman today submitted his twenty-first report on Lend-Lease activities to Congress. The report covers the period up to September 30, 1945, regarding the war against Japan. The main points are as follows: Transporting Lend-Lease goods for the war against Japan was secondary to the needs of the war against Germany. This flow of goods from the United States began in May 1941. From that period until the Pearl Harbor attack, exports totaled $40 million. By the time of Japan's surrender, the export of Lend-Lease munitions and other war supplies had reached $3.8 billion. These goods were a major factor in bringing about Japan's surrender. In addition, we also shipped supplies worth $167 million to American officers in various war zones and transferred them to allied countries in accordance with the provisions of the Lend-Lease program. We sent 8,800 Lend-Lease aircraft to the Asian and Pacific war zones, including 850 four-engine bombers, 1,452 two-engine and one-engine bombers, 2,800 fighters, 1,360 transport aircraft, and the remaining number were training aircraft. The transport aircraft were used to transport supplies from one base to another, and also to China. Under the Lend-Lease program, we shipped 3,200 tanks, most of which were shipped to India. We also shipped 21 American-made trucks to the allied countries fighting against Japan.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the program to October 1, 1945, Lend-Lease goods shipped to China were worth approximately $224.4 million. But in fact, American Lend-Lease aid to China has exceeded the value of the above exports. We authorized American military commanders in various regions to transfer Lend-Lease goods to China. The Lend-Lease goods in this area were worth $167 million. This figure is not included in the export figures mentioned above. We also provided China with assistance in various other ways, such as training aircraft and equipment for training pilots in the United States. At the same time, the supplies of the American troops in China transferred to the Chinese army were also included in the Lend-Lease aid. However, we have not yet fully received the latest reports as of now. The Chinese army's most needed munitions and transportation equipment, and most of the above types have been included to meet their needs. We also supplied China with limited but extremely important precision machine tool parts and rare metals to help them increase their own munitions production. According to the Lend-Lease program, we can also supply China with technical personnel to serve in supervisory and technical positions. We sent more than a thousand American technicians to the Far East to train Chinese personnel to repair and use transportation vehicles.</p>
<p>During the war against Japan, China supplied the American army with its limited resources, and tens of millions of Chinese people helped the American air force build airfields, the Ledo Road, and other facilities with extensive uses. The greatest contribution of China to the common war effort was its eight years of resolute resistance against Japan. This heroic struggle of hundreds of millions of people against aggression has paled in comparison with the material contributions estimated in money.</p>
<h3 id="e28">China is Planning to Implement a Preliminary Post-War Reconstruction Plan, Intends to Purchase a Large Number of Goods from the United States, According to a Representative of the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Association <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, January 30th, United Press] Ms. Smith, Washington representative of the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Association, said that China is now planning to implement a preliminary post-war reconstruction plan, which will spend 2 billion yuan in three years, and China will purchase a large number of goods from the United States. Smith made the remarks at a gathering of 100 members of the Export Advertising Association. She said that the government's large-scale purchases and the inevitable large-scale purchases of goods by private individuals after the war will make China an ideal place for advertisers. China has used modern advertising techniques in the past 20 years, and American advertisers will be able to learn about this medium. In order to facilitate China's promotion of goods, advertisers not only have a great opportunity to introduce American technological developments to China, but also China's specialized publications, newspapers and magazines have increased day by day in recent years, and at the same time, they can also enable the United States to gain an understanding of modern China. The China that the United States could recognize in the past was a poor and hard-working country. Chinese intellectuals are committed to transforming the social state and establishing China as a modernized country. They all know the low living standards of the domestic masses, but they also raise reasonable inquiries, that is, why do Americans often expose this conspiracy, but do not introduce the construction work that has been completed and is in progress. The main force for building a new China will be professional and technical talents. They have completed amazing achievements due to wartime needs, but this may not be achieved in 50 years in peacetime. After the abolition of extraterritoriality, the Chinese market will increase accordingly, and the sales area will also be re-evaluated. Because American businessmen will be able to do business in any region of China for the first time in the future. She predicts that China's stable monetary system can get a "reasonable opportunity", and if trade barriers are eliminated by international trade organizations and other media, China can obtain a basis for working to stabilize the monetary system. Ms. Smith has worked for the State Department in China for 20 years.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, January 31st] Pierrepont, the 75-year-old No. 1 British executioner, has recently retired after 35 years of service.

<h3 id="e35">US President's Message to Congress: Urges Approval of Loan to Britain, Says It Will Help Expand World Trade <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, January 30th] President Truman yesterday sent a message to Congress, asking for approval of a loan of $3.75 billion to Britain. It stated, "Britain needs this line of credit, and needs it now. It is not an exaggeration to say that this agreement will chart the course of US-British economic relations for many years to come. Moreover, this action will have a decisive impact on the entire world's international trade, and can help Britain cope with its payment deficit in the next six years, collecting food and raw material supplies from the world, which is essential for the lives of the British people. At the same time, the United States can also maintain the openness of its market for exporting surplus goods to the United Kingdom. All of these are the short-term important goals of the line of credit. In terms of the United States, the most important benefits of the loan can be obtained in its long-term goals. Because the agreement enables the United Kingdom to immediately implement exchange restrictions, and to advance shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States towards the common goal of expanding world trade, thus production, consumption and employment can be expanded, and living standards everywhere can be improved. Regarding the agreement stipulating that Britain can be exempted from paying interest in any year if it finds that it does not have enough cash to pay interest, President Du urged everyone to pay attention, saying: "If they are forced to pay interest even if they cannot pay, which will damage international economic relations, it is not in our interests. In addition to the direct benefits gained from promoting Anglo-American trade, the United Kingdom's leading relaxation of its restrictions will also benefit from the subsequent relaxation by its family. The financial agreement will also enable the United Kingdom to fully support the various trade and employment proposals recently put forward by the United States as a basis for international discussions by the United Nations. The implementation of the agreement will make a significant contribution to establishing lasting peace and prosperity. Furthermore, it will prevent economic disputes from arising between the two countries, and the provisions of the Bretton Woods Agreement will be implemented more quickly and fully than Congress believed possible when it formulated the agreement."</p>
<p>Public Debate Will Take Time</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, January 30th] Judging from today's situation, the chances of quick approval are diminishing. The President's message, together with the full text of the loan agreement, will first be submitted to the committees of both houses of Congress for consideration, and then submitted to the Senate and House of Representatives for public debate. The Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Banking and Trade Committee both estimate that even without a long-term public debate, their hearings will take at least four weeks. It is generally believed that the approval of this agreement is the most controversial diplomatic policy tool in recent years. Senator Brewster (Democrat) firmly believes that the agreement is the "cornerstone of international cooperation," but few members of Congress show signs of accepting this view. Senator Hurlbutt, the Republican leader of the Senate Banking Committee, said that the economic disputes concerning the loan are difficult to reconcile with political disputes, which can be seen from the current situation. Majority Leader Barkley (Democrat) formally declared that the loan to Britain has forced the Senate to choose between a war on the economy or an opportunity to increase exports of American industrial and agricultural products. The United Kingdom is America's best customer. Senator Lyons said that three-quarters of the people who elected him support the loan, and those who oppose it have no chance of winning.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Italy Hopes to Retain Colonies <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, January 31st] The Italian people hope to recover their colonies according to the provisions of the Atlantic Charter, which states: "The United States and the United Kingdom do not desire to see any territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned." Although the Italian people know that Italy has a bill to pay, they feel that the division of Italian colonies by the great powers cannot be used as payment for the bill. Eritrea, Somaliland, Libya and other Italian African colonies have a very close relationship with Italy. In the first 50 years of Italy's development of these colonies, there was no profit at all. It was not until recently that the construction projects began to take shape. Once they have to be handed over to others, the Italian people are unwilling. Moreover, Italy's acquisition of these colonies was with the consent and encouragement of the leaders of European countries at that time. Because there were too many people and too little land in Italy, European countries recognized that Italy had the need to immigrate abroad. If Italy's colonies are deprived, the population of Italy will become crowded again, which is contrary to the intention of maintaining lasting peace.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Dallas, Texas, January 31st] A new type of "flying car" manufactured by Southern Motors was tested at a nearby airport here today and was quite successful. The car is no different from an airplane when flying, but after removing the wings, tail, and various parts, it can be driven on flat ground and parked in a regular car shed. The removal procedure only takes five minutes. The car can accommodate two people and is equipped with a 125-horsepower engine, one front wheel, and two rear wheels. The maximum speed is 128 miles per hour. But this type of car is not yet on the market.</p>

<p>After Bountiful Rains, Auspicious Snow Arrives: Since the beginning of the year, the weather in the county has been mild with little rainfall, causing farmers to eagerly anticipate snow. However, in recent days, there have been plentiful rains, greatly benefiting the fields of beans, wheat, and vegetables. Yesterday (the 30th), starting at 12:30 AM, it suddenly snowed for half an hour. Although the snowfall was not heavy, it was still beneficial to agriculture, marking the first snowfall of this winter.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Province Salt Tax Reduced by Order</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Assembly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Liangzhe Salt Administration requesting a reduction in salt tax rates, an increase in purchase prices, and the establishment of welfare programs for salt workers to sustain their livelihoods. The Salt Administration has responded as follows: (1) The salt tax rates have been repeatedly submitted to the ministry and administration and were approved for implementation in December of last year. The rate for each area and the recovered areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, and Shaoxing was set at 1,500 yuan per load; the rate for Wenzhou and He counties was reduced from 3,410 yuan to 2,000 yuan per load; the rate for the districts under the jurisdiction of the administration was reduced from 4,910 yuan to 4,000 yuan per load; the rate for Jinhua and other counties was set at 4,000 yuan per load; and the rate for Yanping and other districts was reduced from 7,410 yuan to 4,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan per load, respectively. The rates for Longquan and other counties are still being adjusted. (2) The purchase prices for each area were also approved for adjustment starting in late December of last year, with a price of 1,000 yuan per load for boiled salt and 700 yuan per load for sun-dried salt. (3) Welfare programs for salt workers have already been established in Wenzhou and Taizhou, including schools and clinics for the children of salt workers. The recovered areas are also gradually planning similar programs.</p>

<p>Using the Baojia System to Report Traitors</p>
<p>After the victory, most of the traitors in Jiaxing who owned assets or held high positions have fled. Those who remain are either those who held ordinary puppet positions or those who are poor and unable to escape. Some are still serving in other organizations. The authorities once took action to arrest and prosecute them. Now, the County Provisional Assembly, in order to eradicate traitors, has decided to use the baojia system to report them and has organized a visitation group to ensure that no major traitors escape and that no ill-gotten gains are hidden. The members of the group have been appointed and will soon set out in groups to conduct investigations.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Mountbatten: Still as a Virgin, Swift as a Rabbit – The Southeast Asian Situation Turns Around <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>—A Telegram from London, December 22nd, by Xue Yan</p>
<p>Seen from Britain, the post-war problems in Europe and the Far Eastern Theater are completely different, and Britain's role is also quite different. Europe, after this catastrophe, is scarred and its people are destitute. The most urgent need is relief. Moreover, various small countries are plagued by left-right struggles. Britain's hope is only that its influence will not be completely ignored in these disputes between the left and right factions. Everyone knows that Britain's traditional policy towards the European continent is to adopt an observer's attitude, not to get involved in its internal entanglements. What Britain cares most about is that no overwhelming power should emerge on the continent, so it often supports the second strongest to resist the strongest power, maintaining a balance of power so that Britain's own strength can be concentrated on the development of the empire. Whether Britain will still adopt this traditional policy towards Europe after this war, we do not know, but at least Britain has not explicitly stated that it will abandon this traditional policy. Some say that Britain's current strong support for France is a manifestation of this new balance of power policy, which may be correct. Therefore, Britain's policy towards Europe is how to relieve the people's livelihood, restore stability, and maintain a balance of power, which can be said to be more focused on the passive aspects. Post-war problems are therefore post-war reconstruction problems.</p>
<p>General Mountbatten Handles Southeast Asia Single-Handedly</p>
<p>But the situation in the Far Eastern Theater is very different. In the Far Eastern Theater, the one most closely related to Britain is the Southeast Asian Theater. This is an area rich in materials and with a low level of public knowledge. There are many natural resources that have not yet been developed. In terms of wealth, it is a treasure trove with infinite potential, and therefore it is a great treasure trove with unlimited prospects. In today's British Empire, which has many disputes and opportunities for development, a new world may be unfolded. Therefore, Britain's handling of the post-war problems in this theater is more proactive and places unlimited hope on it.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia is just a collective geographical term without a fixed boundary. Any area within the command authority of the Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia is Southeast Asia. After Japan surrendered, it was stipulated that Siam and southern Vietnam would also be accepted by the Supreme Allied Commander of Southeast Asia, so these two places are also considered to be within the scope of Southeast Asia. The two most famous sentences in ancient Chinese military books praising generals' strategies are "Still as a virgin, swift as a rabbit." General Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of Southeast Asia, is most worthy of these two comments. Since the establishment of the Supreme Allied Headquarters of Southeast Asia, he has been sitting in Ceylon for two years, and his command has been decisive, which can be said to be as still as a virgin. When the Japanese surrendered, he immediately took action. In a few months, not only have Burma, Malaya, Singapore, and other places been completely recovered, but also in Siam, southern Vietnam, and the Dutch and British-owned South Pacific Islands, he has made deployments and achieved remarkable results. Today, the vast territory of Southeast Asia is all in the process of being disposed of by him.</p>
<p>Britain Assists in Restoring Order in Vietnamese Territory Formerly Governed by the Han Dynasty</p>
<p>If we pay attention to today's Southeast Asia, we know that military problems, except for the Dutch East Indies, have mostly passed. Even the military situation in the Dutch East Indies is no longer a matter of disarming the Japanese army, but a matter of conflict between the British army, the Dutch army, and the local revolutionary army. But the political problems are relatively complex, and because the historical backgrounds of various places are different, the ways of dealing with them are naturally also different. Among them, the former British colonies, such as Burma, Malaya, and British-owned South Pacific Islands, are mainly about restoring the original state and returning to the scope of the British Empire. The most urgent thing at present is price control and commodity supply, which need to be solved immediately, but this is an almost universal phenomenon in the world at present, which is not surprising. Secondly, in southern French Vietnam, Britain's policy is also very clear, mainly to disarm the Japanese army and restore order, and in order to restore order, it also strives to subdue the local people's resistance to France. Now this task has come to an end, and it can be handed over to France as it was before. Vietnam had received many promises from France during the Japanese occupation, but how these promises will be fulfilled is a matter for France in the future. Britain did not say that it should be listed as one of the conditions for handover. This is clearly different from the Dutch East Indies problem we will discuss later. Among the post-war problems in Southeast Asia today, the most subtle are the problems of Siam and the Dutch East Indies, but both places have recently had new results.</p>
<p>After Compromising with the United States, Britain and Siam Signed a Peace Agreement</p>
<p>Siam was considered an independent country before the war. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, it has been the only country that cooperated with Japan in doing evil in the Far East. It had used troops against China on the southern border of Lingnan, oppressed overseas Chinese before the war, and was the only country in the world that committed the most heinous crimes against overseas Chinese during the war and refused to repent after Japan surrendered, continuing to massacre overseas Chinese. This time, following Japan's surrender, the Supreme Allied Headquarters of Southeast Asia sent troops to garrison and disarm the Japanese army in its territory and punish Siam. We not only agree with this, but also pay close attention to it. We have long heard that Siam has sent representatives to Singapore to discuss a peace agreement with representatives of General Mountbatten. However, London newspapers publish very little about the content of the peace agreement. As for the reason for the scarcity, we speculate that it is not that the British people do not pay attention, but that the British people trust General Mountbatten very much and feel that the products that pass through Mountbatten's hands will not be detrimental to Britain. There is no need to consult carefully. Sometimes not consulting and letting him proceed quietly may be more beneficial to Britain. It was not until December 19 that the US State Department suddenly released news that the peace agreement currently being negotiated between Britain and Siam would result in Siam becoming a British dependency. At the same time, the US Chargé d'Affaires in London officially went to the British Foreign Office to inquire and explain the US's views. Since then, British newspapers have gradually revealed the content of the agreement and explained on behalf of the government, saying that the conditions are not too harsh. It is said that the only harsher condition is that Siam should compensate 1.5 million tons of rice, but considering Siam's predictable bumper harvest this year, it is not too excessive and will not hinder Siam's own food supply. Later, newspapers vaguely mentioned that the British government was explaining to the United States, and some newspapers predicted that the signing of the agreement would be postponed. It was not until December 22 that the US State Department announced the withdrawal of its proposal, saying that although the US's suggestions were not fully accepted by the British side, most of them had been accepted, so the US's request for a postponement of the signing was automatically withdrawn. As a result, the peace agreement between Britain and Siam was signed in Singapore on New Year's Day this year. Due to the above process, we can believe that the agreement signed now is the result of a compromise between Britain and the United States. As for the original conditions, we do not know them because they have never been fully disclosed. We also do not know what the US's suggestions were and what parts were accepted by Britain.</p>
<p>Nine Key Points of the Agreement Include a Ban on the Export of Siamese Rice</p>
<p>The key points of the agreement have been published in the London newspapers of the 2nd, which are roughly as follows: (1) All British-owned territories occupied by Siam after December 7, 1941, shall be completely returned. (2) The Siamese government shall return all public and private rights and property losses suffered by Britain in Siam during the war and compensate for the losses. (3) Siam shall fully cooperate with the international security measures stipulated in the United Nations organization. The canal of the Kra Isthmus shall not be excavated without the consent of Britain. (4) Siam and Britain and the British-owned territories near Siam shall resume import and export trade and coastal shipping as soon as possible and re-sign trade and shipping treaties. (5) Before September 1, 1947, Siam shall prohibit the export of rice, tin, rubber, and teak, and provide 1.5 million tons of rice free of charge for food in nearby British-owned territories, unless introduced by the Combined Board in Washington. (6) Siam shall participate in general international measures regarding the handling of tin and rubber as soon as possible by negotiating a trade and shipping treaty with India. (7) Restore the rights and interests of British merchants and civil aviation in Siam, at a minimum, restore the rights enjoyed by Imperial Airways before December 7, 1941. (8) Restore all international treaties or agreements that Siam and Britain or India participated in before December 7, 1941. Siam must also fulfill its obligations under the international treaties that Britain or India participated in (but Siam did not participate in) before December 7, 1941. Siam shall also comply with and fulfill its responsibilities and obligations arising under the international organizations established after December 7, 1941. (9) In view of the above conditions, Britain immediately recognizes that the state of belligerency of Siam has ended, restores normal international relations, exchanges diplomatic envoys, and Britain and India support Siam's participation in the United Nations organization. One party to this agreement is the representative of Britain and India, and the other party is the representative of Siam.</p>
<p>Britain and India Have Been Compensated, China Should Also Make Demands</p>
<p>Because the British newspapers did not disclose the original text of the agreement, we have no way to speculate whether this is the entire treaty. If it is, then the US's statement that Siam will become a British territory is an exaggeration. Or it is different from the original draft, which is the result of Britain accepting the US's suggestions. Judging from the above clauses alone, the first thing we notice is that there is no mention of troop withdrawal. Secondly, although this is an agreement signed between Britain and India and Siam, Siam's important products have been restricted and cannot be freely exported. Because the Combined Board in Washington is actually only an organization of Britain and the United States, other countries have no way to intervene even if they re-sign a treaty with Siam. As for the export of rice, it is most noteworthy that China may also need to import Siamese rice to relieve disaster areas in the next two years, and it is now restricted. In this war, China and overseas Chinese suffered the most harm from Siam. Britain and India have now been compensated, and China should also demand compensation. In addition, after the establishment of the agreement between Britain and India and Siam, the impact on the commerce and economy within Siam is profound, and most of the overseas Chinese in Siam are in the economic and commercial circles. At a minimum, we should immediately take steps to prevent the Siamese government from shifting this responsibility to our overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Britain Strengthens Control and Maintains Neutrality Towards East India</p>
<p>The restoration of order and the disarmament of the Japanese army in East India, especially Batavia, is the most troublesome. What London newspapers publish is mostly news about this aspect, which is all related to military affairs. During the Japanese occupation, the Dutch East Indies was given the status of so-called independence, which somewhat sowed the seeds of national consciousness. Moreover, under the banner of the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," the degree of cooperation obtained by the local residents seemed to be better than under the rule of Western countries. Britain, the Netherlands, and other countries have also understood this. Churchill also mentioned it in the Parliament before. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands also made many enlightened promises to East India in her speech on December 6, 1942, announcing that once East India returns to the Netherlands, it will give the local residents greater political participation. In August of this year, after the Japanese army surrendered, the responsibility for the liberation of East India also fell on the Supreme Allied Headquarters of Southeast Asia. However, the troop allocation of the Supreme Allied Headquarters of Southeast Asia was insufficient, and only a small number of troops could land in East India in mid-September. At that time, the Malay people had formed a republican government and seemed to have obtained some of the Japanese army's weapons, so they also possessed considerable military strength. The task of the British army was stated to be only to disarm the Japanese army, liberate the prisoners of war detained in the Dutch East Indies, and maintain order. It declared that it would not interfere in the local residents' independence movement and would adopt a neutral attitude towards the conflict between the residents and the Dutch authorities. However, as long as another armed force exists, the British army's control over East India will not be complete. With the increase of the British army, the control over the island will naturally be strengthened. In addition, the Dutch army, along with the Dutch administrative organization set up in the South Pacific, went to East India, and military conflicts were inevitable. According to British newspapers, the Indonesian authorities were unable to fully enforce orders on the army, and the discipline of the Indonesian army was not very strict, so it often became a threat to public security. Even if the negotiations with the Indonesian political authorities go well, atrocities are still inevitable. Around Christmas, the strength of the British army had been considerably strengthened, and it notified the Indonesian authorities to place all their troops under the command of the British army in order to ensure public security. After this measure is implemented, military actions seem to come to an end.</p>
<p>During this period, the Dutch government felt very棘手(棘手：tricky/thorny/difficult to deal with). Dutch Prime Minister Professor Schermerhorn and East Indies Governor Dr. Van Mook specially came to London before Christmas to exchange views with the authorities before deciding on the steps to be taken. When Schermerhorn and others arrived in London, it happened that British Prime Minister Attlee had gone to the countryside for the Christmas holidays, so the talks did not begin until the 28th. It was generally speculated that the talks would last a long time, at least two days, but they ended in one day. After the meeting, Schermerhorn激授(激授：highly commended) said that the results of the meeting were very satisfactory. Downing Street No. 10 also issued a public statement on this matter, which included two major parts: The first part explained the process of the talks, discussing the situation in Java and the effective actions to be taken to restore local law and order. The Netherlands has fully informed Britain of the enlightened policies it intends to take toward the Indonesian people. The second part explained Britain's responsibilities: (1) To establish security and order as soon as possible so that the Dutch East Indies government can continue to hold talks with the Indonesian representatives. (2) The two countries agree that promoting understanding between the Dutch East Indies authorities and the nationalist movements is one of the main conditions for the completion of the British mission. (3) To do its best to protect the prisoners of war and civilians detained in the Dutch East Indies. We see that this public statement has few new ideas. It does not seem sufficient to explain the policies and attitudes of the two countries. If the Netherlands only relies on what is stated in this public statement to solve the problems of the Dutch East Indies, I am afraid it will not achieve greater success than before. The only hint we can get from this public statement seems to be that Britain is treating the Netherlands and the Indonesian people equally and neutrally, without forgetting that the Indonesian people are indeed just and neutral. Comparing this with Britain's attitude towards southern Vietnam, there is a clear difference. Now East Indies Governor Dr. Mook is said to be preparing to return to the Dutch East Indies, with the aim of negotiating with Indonesian representatives to resolve the political conflict. Before setting off, he first stated that he would not meet with extremists. How things will turn out in the future depends on the evolution of the facts. We do not dare to predict too early whether he can achieve success.</p>
<p>In this political conflict between the Indonesian people and the Dutch authorities, the opinions of most British newspapers seem to be quite sympathetic to the Indonesian people.</p>

<p>"Peking Man" was seized by the Japanese army during the war and has now been found in Japan by the occupying authorities. "Peking Man" is one of the earliest known ancestors of modern humans, discovered in 1929 in a limestone cave in Zhoukoudian near Beiping. They were stored in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and are considered treasures of scientists. The occupying authorities recently received notification from the Japanese government and found the original items inside Tokyo Imperial University. In addition to the "Peking Man" skull, there were also primitive tools, carved ivory ornaments, and charts indicating the excavation site. Letters found prove that the Chinese had secretly hidden them well during the war. Japanese scientists had searched for three years before seizing them. All items are currently temporarily kept by Dr. Whitmore of the U.S. Geological Survey, a scientific advisor to the headquarters, and will be returned to the China Geological Survey in Beiping later. Both "Peking Man" and Java Man are over one million years old, competing for the title of the earliest ancestor of humans. Although "Peking Man" is slightly later in time, they are closer to modern humans and are considered more important. Some of the scientists who studied "Peking Man" were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and were extremely careful during excavation in the cave. Records were kept of all layers, and the artifacts excavated from each layer can trace the evolution of the inhabitants back to many centuries ago. (United Press, Tokyo, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e45">Technicians Mobilized Behind the Scenes to Clear Magnetic Mines - British Admiralty's Dr. Good-Wu Reveals the Truth <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Our Editorial Department</p>
<p>World War II was not limited to the three battlefields of land, sea, and air. Most interesting were the various facts of how British and American scientists mobilized all their intelligence behind the scenes, engaging in secret scientific warfare with German and Japanese scientists. The experience gained during the war has a profound effect on the struggle to achieve victorious peace. The most prominent drama in technical warfare—we can say it is a war in itself—was the victory in radio. The well-known "radar" is also included in this battle.</p>
<p>Weapon Radar – Manipulating Activities in Many Ways</p>
<p>The development of radar has produced the most amazing results. A British scientist was the first to discover the military significance of radar, namely that radio waves emitted from aircraft could interfere with radio reception. Facts proved that the English Channel was no longer an obstacle. Therefore, all research work related to this new method of reconnaissance, searching, and locating was rigorously carried out. When the great test day arrived in August 1940, everything was ready. During the "Battle of Britain," when the German Air Force launched a full-scale attack on Britain, British pilots shot down many invading Nazi pilots. However, it was the radar experts and technicians manipulating behind the scenes who directed them to their targets.</p>
<p>Radar not only conquered fog and darkness, but it also greatly expanded the application range of electronic physics. Electronic physics has expanded from a relatively small application range to the point where it now occupies almost half of the British government's entire scientific effort. Vacuum tubes, like radio tubes and cathode ray tubes, can be found on almost every battlefield, and perhaps this will be the case in peacetime life as well.</p>
<p>These discoveries and achievements were led by Britain. She exchanged all relevant information with the United States and cooperated closely. The Germans also imitated the new scientific inventions based on some information they obtained from British and American aircraft shot down over the continent. German Admiral Dönitz described how Britain used radar to overcome the submarine threat, saying: "The scientists who invented the method of searching for locations using radio were regarded as the saviors of their country. What made the British win in the submarine war was not their superior strategy or tactics, but entirely the victory in scientific research." The need for physicists in radio warfare was unprecedented! All of Britain's experts were mobilized, and even experts from all over the world were recruited. In addition, many new talents were drawn from various scientific departments.</p>
<p>The main technical war of World War I was the war of materials; this time it was a war of chemists. Britain's various preparations in World War II were based on the strong foundation laid by the chemical industry at that time. At that time, each chemical department already had its large-scale research laboratory. The war of materials continued in this war, but there were few serious problems like those that arose during World War I.</p>
<p>Every major war must have design engineers participating; however, there is a severe lack of such talent. Knowing how to cultivate a good design engineer is a difficult matter.</p>
<p>Magnetic Mines - Displaying Technical Wisdom</p>
<p>In terms of duration, technical achievement, and manpower, the magnetic mine warfare may belong to the same category as radio or anti-submarine warfare; however, it was the first technical war in this war. In terms of interests, it has the same consistency as the other two, and it was also a battle that Britain won and Germany did not expect. Its reverberating power is very important.</p>
<p>In any battle, you must know what weapons the enemy is using. In technical warfare, this is also the case, especially for the defensive side, which relies heavily on its technical wisdom. In October 1939, although Britain knew that the enemy was using magnetic mines, she could not correctly understand the characteristics of magnetic mines, so she had not obtained advanced methods sufficient to truly resist them.</p>
<p>The story of the capture of the first magnetic mine and its analysis has now been widely discussed in newspapers and on the radio. People are talking about "degaussing," which is the electrical safety belt for ships. But that is only part of the story, because the "degaussing" method is only a partial defense. It is very obvious that after the enemy lays mines, they need to be cleared as soon as possible if possible.</p>
<p>The German magnetic mines were improved based on the style of World War I. If a magnetic steel rod supports a horizontal axis in the middle, allowing it to rotate and roll freely on a straight line (like a see-saw board, replacing the horizontal line method on a compass), then the north pole needle of this steel rod will move down to a certain angle. The size of this angle depends on how far it is from the north magnetic pole (in its own position, it will shift to the horizontal plane. On the geomagnetic equator, it does not move down. If it is south of the geomagnetic equator, then the south pole needle will move down). By installing this needle with a self-adjusting spiral spring, the force of the spring can be accurately determined, causing the needle to move towards the equal or opposite force of the spring. Under the bottom of a steel ship, the magnetic activity is greater than usual, and a balanced needle will move down, causing electrical contact. The technical story about magnetic mine clearance will be added in another article.</p>

<p>Shenyang, Dalian, Changchun, and Harbin are the four major towns in the Northeast. The conditions of these four cities are sufficient to represent the face of the Northeast. The current situation of the Northeast after the restoration, according to the impressions obtained by the reporter, can be summarized as follows: What remains in the Northeast today are thousands upon thousands of solid, huge, and modernized empty-shell buildings. Restoration still requires our greatest efforts. The modernized railway transportation in the Northeast is now in a state of paralysis. The Changchun Railway's trapezoidal railway line is still running trains, but the number of trains has been greatly reduced, the roadbed has not been maintained for a long time, and the train operation is unstable. Passenger trains from Changchun via Shenyang to Dalian run once a day in opposite directions. The Harbin-Changchun section runs three times a day in opposite directions. Passenger travel on both sections is extremely crowded. The order along the way is not good, and it is extremely cold, and passengers consider it most fortunate to arrive at their destination safely.</p>
<p>Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang Municipal Administration – Gradual Progress</p>
<p>The four cities of Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, and Dalian, except for Dalian, all have mayors who are promoting municipal administration. Shenyang's municipal administration has made the most rapid progress in difficult circumstances. Work on public works and education has already begun and has achieved considerable success. A large amount of materials and funds are being prepared to welcome the National Army. Changchun's municipal administration is easier to develop than Shenyang's because society is more stable. Work on finance, education, industry, and police has been carried out according to plan. The municipal foundation of Harbin has not moved, but the social order is still good. In addition to strengthening education work, other tasks only need to be continued.</p>
<p>Most Factories – Recovery is Imminent</p>
<p>The industries of the four cities, except for Changchun and Harbin, Shenyang and Dalian are highly industrialized areas. Although 70% of the factories have been destroyed, they are not difficult to restore. Commerce in the Northeast was quite developed in the four cities in the past, with Shenyang being the most prosperous. Since the Japanese surrender, commerce has declined, and stores have closed one after another. What is displayed in large stores are all crude Japanese daily necessities. There are many peddlers in the four cities, and many of them are set up by Japanese women.</p>
<p>A Leather Overcoat – Priced at 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The famous leather coats of the Northeast are now hard to find. Currently, a better light fur coat is priced at around 200,000 yuan. In the future, the prosperity of commerce in the Northeast depends on the restoration of water and land transportation. The people here are in great need of education. The reporter believes that the large-scale import of news materials and the universal supply of textbooks are urgent tasks. (30th)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Foreign Exchange Should Be Determined As Soon As Possible <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange problem has been rumored for days, and it is impossible to know the truth. Finance Minister Yu recently stated that it will be announced soon. Reports from the capital say that it has already been determined, but according to news from the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai, it is absolutely not true. Whether it is true or not can only be verified by facts. Our opinion is that we hope it is true and that it will be determined and announced as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We know that labor strikes are surging and society is turbulent. Although there are many reasons for this, most of it is due to high prices and drastic fluctuations. We also know that high prices and drastic fluctuations also have many reasons, but most of it is due to the instability of the currency value. The currency value should be stabilized as soon as possible. Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper briefly explained its general principles.</p>
<p>How can the currency value be stabilized? The indirect factors are certainly many, but the direct and fastest way cannot but start with determining the foreign exchange rate. Because the legal currency itself has no inherent value, its reserves do not depend on materials, but on the foreign exchange funds held by the country, so the legal currency has long been disconnected from materials, and its value is completely dependent on the exchange rate. Therefore, determining foreign exchange is tantamount to determining the currency value, and determining the currency value is stabilizing prices and stabilizing life.</p>
<p>Since the restoration, the uncertainty of the exchange rate of pseudo-currency initially caused a huge wave of prices. After the exchange rate of pseudo-currency was determined, the failure to determine the foreign exchange rate repeatedly caused a huge wave of prices. In this process, speculators' stirring up trouble and hoarders' fueling the flames should certainly bear a large part of the responsibility, but the reason why these speculators and hoarders are happy to stir up trouble and fuel the flames is nothing more than a desire for profit. In other words, taking advantage of the uncertainty of foreign exchange, they secretly peek and manipulate as much as possible, and even repeatedly spread rumors to grab temporary windfall profits. But who knows that the lives of the public and the order of social security are greatly affected by them! Therefore, it is these speculators and hoarders who squeeze the livelihoods of ordinary people, and it is the authorities who are indecisive and cannot act immediately that enable these speculators and hoarders to squeeze the livelihoods of ordinary people. If the government still does not determine the exchange rate to achieve the effect of determining the currency value, then "Although I did not kill Bo Ren, Bo Ren died because of me," the authorities should not be indifferent.</p>
<p>We believe that today, to eliminate labor strikes and stabilize people's livelihoods, it is not possible to solve the problem by simply increasing wages today and annual bonuses tomorrow. Only by stabilizing the currency value as soon as possible with all possible strength can prices be prevented from rising. And the method of stabilizing the currency value is to determine the foreign exchange rate as soon as possible, which is the most direct and appropriate method. Of course, at the beginning of the announcement of the exchange rate, all prices and wages need a degree of adjustment. During this adjustment period, some disturbances are still inevitable, and this disturbance may be even more intense than in the past and present. But once the adjustment is completed, the amplitude of all prices will ultimately not be the same as it is now, although it may not be possible to be completely quiet and completely return to the usual state. The most undesirable thing is that the government abandons its policy halfway. If the exchange rate is announced, there must be a fixed opinion and determination, otherwise indecision and inconsistency will only give speculators and hoarders one more opportunity. A better policy may even receive very bad results!</p>
<p>As for high exchange rates or low exchange rates, high prices or low prices, the so-called "different people see different things, with benefits and harms equally divided," the research and discussions from all sides in the past few months have also been detailed and exhaustive, and there is no need to repeat them. But looking at the opinions of the reader Yang Qingtao disclosed in today's newspaper, we can get a glimpse of the psychology of ordinary people, who already believe that this issue is a matter of urgency and can no longer allow the government to let a few speculators and hoarders speculate and make a fortune. The most fearful thing in the world is social injustice. All sources of chaos and misfortune evolve from "injustice." Low exchange rates lead to high prices, and high exchange rates lead to low prices. Of course, different people see different things. But which policy is beneficial to the general public and which policy can stabilize the livelihoods of the general public? Just look at the rumor-fueled price increases of the past two or three days, and you can think about it more than halfway. We will not provide one-sided opinions for the time being, and ask the government to make a consideration of the overall situation. But consideration is possible, delay is not; careful research is possible, letting rumors speculate is not. Therefore, no matter how high or low the exchange rate is, what we most hope for today is that the authorities determine and implement this point as soon as possible. If this exchange rate is set very appropriately, so that all parties can obtain considerable satisfaction, it will naturally be welcomed by us; even if overall planning is taken into account and it is not easy to achieve in practice, and perhaps one aspect will feel disappointed, but it is much better than guessing, rising and falling without certainty, making the entire people's lives long in turmoil, the entire industrial production long in stagnation, and the entire import and export trade long in blockage and stagnation.</p>
<p>Some believe that the price difference between domestic and foreign countries is too great today, and it is not easy to maintain if it is hastily regulated at this time. This is not without reason. However, in comparing two evils, we can only choose the lesser. In order to alleviate the suffering of the people and the precariousness of the economic sector, we believe that resolving the matter as soon as possible is still more beneficial than delaying indefinitely.</p>
<p>Of course, stabilizing the currency value cannot rely solely on determining the foreign exchange rate. If the consultation conference fails and military spending cannot be reduced, currency cannot be tightened, and production cannot be promoted, even a determined exchange rate may not be maintained. However, the determination of the exchange rate is, after all, a necessary condition for stabilizing the currency value and stabilizing prices, so we still agree to determine it as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Nationalize Gold and Raise Exchange Rates: Emergency Measures to Stabilize the National Economy <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Qingtao</p>
<p>(1) Eliminating Speculative Activities</p>
<p>To stabilize the national economy, the most pressing issues now are to raise the value of our currency and suppress commodity prices. Currently, the value of our currency is falling daily, commodity prices are soaring, followed by workers striking to demand higher wages, and factories shrinking due to unsustainable burdens. This not only constantly threatens the livelihoods of the general public but also makes it impossible to establish national industries. Therefore, even if a comprehensive national economic policy has not yet been fully determined, at least emergency measures should be taken to raise the value of our currency, suppress commodity prices, and stabilize the economic lives of the people.</p>
<p>In recent months, commodity prices have been rising rapidly for many reasons; there is no single remedy. For example, increasing production to balance supply and demand; facilitating transportation to ensure smooth distribution of goods. These fundamental issues cannot be resolved overnight. The emergency measures that we are now requesting the government to take are to immediately issue an order to stop speculative activities. Because speculative activities create a mentality among the general public that belittles the value of legal tender and disregards government credit, leading to a rush to exchange currency for goods, which in turn induces further price increases, higher worker wages, and continued issuance of currency, which then further fuels speculative activities. The result of this vicious cycle is only the creation of a small number of nouveau riche through gambling-like speculation, while harming the economic lives of the majority of the people and accelerating the country's financial and national economic collapse! Today, the government authorities are sitting idly by, seemingly unaware of the activities of speculators in the Shanghai market, which is truly perplexing!</p>
<p>The leading forces in today's speculative activities are exchange rate rumors and gold speculation. For example, on January 28th and 29th, rumors of exchange rate changes and soaring gold prices triggered a surge in all other commodity prices. Naturally, the government should swiftly crack down on any hoarding and speculative activities, but the most urgent issues to resolve are the foreign exchange problem and the gold problem.</p>
<p>(2) Nationalize Gold</p>
<p>Gold speculation leads other speculative activities; rising gold prices further stimulate the rise in other goods. To curb speculation and suppress commodity prices, I advocate and suggest that the government immediately issue an order to nationalize all gold in the country.</p>
<p>The policy of nationalizing gold is based on the following reasons and needs to be implemented as soon as possible:</p>
<p>First, many people who made fortunes from the national crisis and victory since the war have converted their assets into gold. Nationalizing gold can prevent these people from freely converting their gold into currency to maintain their wealth and extravagance, while the general public struggles to survive. Granted, not everyone who holds gold obtained it illegally by exploiting the national crisis or victory, but they are a minority, and certainly not the poor. If the national economy can be put on a stable track, then even if these non-poor few experience temporary inconvenience (because nationalizing gold does not mean confiscating gold, so they can avoid sacrifice), it is still feasible.</p>
<p>Second, the Bretton Woods Agreement stipulates that each country's government should contribute a fixed amount of gold as a reserve for the World Bank. Our government has already ratified the agreement and will have to pay the full amount of gold in the future. However, our cash reserves are not large, so we must not allow gold to be dispersed into private hands, but should concentrate it in the government. For this reason, our country must adopt a policy of nationalizing gold. Furthermore, future international trade must be conducted by the state through the World Bank, and privately held gold cannot be used as a benchmark for international trade settlements, so privately owned gold will be worthless.</p>
<p>Third, once the policy of nationalizing gold is implemented, not only will the government's gold reserves increase, but also, by stopping gold speculation and then stopping all speculative activities, it will reduce a large number of parasitic individuals who engage in gambling-like speculation without producing anything, and save a lot of luxury waste caused by the sudden wealth of these speculators. This can directly and indirectly increase national wealth.</p>
<p>For the aforementioned reasons, nationalizing gold is beneficial and harmless and should be implemented as soon as possible. As for the implementation methods of the gold nationalization policy, the following suggestions are offered:</p>
<p>First, immediately prohibit private buying and selling of gold, ban gold markets, and arrest violators.</p>
<p>Second, the government should designate reliable banks or institutions to purchase privately held gold at a reasonable legal price. Gold prices should be paid in bonds, not cash, to avoid increasing the amount of legal tender in circulation. Third, gold purchases should be conducted in three phases: the first phase, assumed to be two months, pays bonds at the current reasonable price; the second phase, also assumed to be two months, pays bonds at a reduced price; after this period, in the third phase, all privately held gold will be confiscated without compensation. However, whether buying or confiscating, responsible receipts must be given to prevent embezzlement and corruption.</p>
<p>(3) Raise Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Regarding the foreign exchange rate issue that has been hotly debated recently, we believe that it should be decided as soon as possible, and it should be appropriately raised. Some people advocate lowering the exchange rate, that is, devaluing legal tender, to protect national industries. However, the rumors of exchange rate changes and the devaluation of legal tender around January 28th immediately stimulated a surge in gold prices and general commodity prices, indicating that if the exchange rate were truly lowered, it would inevitably induce a surge in commodity prices first. From this practical experience, it should be known that the result of lowering the exchange rate is only to create chaos in finance and commodity prices, which will not promote export trade and will not protect national industries.</p>
<p>Conversely, raising the exchange rate will allow foreign goods to flow in, which will help suppress commodity prices. Furthermore, our country's economic construction in the future will require the purchase of new machinery from advanced countries, and raising the exchange rate will allow us to purchase large quantities of this necessary machinery, which will help economic construction and industrial revitalization.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, whether from a theoretical or factual perspective, lowering the exchange rate only shows its disadvantages and not its benefits; raising the exchange rate has more benefits than disadvantages. Therefore, we oppose lowering the exchange rate and advocate raising the exchange rate. As for methods to promote foreign exports and protect national industries, relying on lowering the exchange rate is not the solution, as mentioned earlier (because as soon as the news of lowering the exchange rate spreads, domestic commodity prices will soar first). Instead, the government should be requested to sign suitable trade agreements with friendly countries, stipulating the types and quantities of imported goods and the levels and prices of exported goods, or use other economic plans to help, in order to solve the problem.</p>
<p>The exchange rate should be decided as soon as possible, and it should be higher than the current black market exchange rate. It should be known that lowering the exchange rate and devaluing legal tender not only do not help export trade and national industries in fact, but also induce a surge in commodity prices, and government credit will be damaged as a result!</p>
<p>(4) Hoping for Decisive Implementation</p>
<p>Since the victory, government authorities have considered economic measures too much, allowing a few speculators to take the opportunity to stir up trouble, commodity prices have risen endlessly, and the people's livelihood has become extremely precarious! In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, promote construction, and also to protect the government and enhance its prestige, we specially offer the above humble opinions. It is hoped that the governing authorities, in addition to quickly discussing and determining a comprehensive and concrete economic plan, will also take emergency measures in advance, immediately issue an order to nationalize gold, stop speculation, raise exchange rates, suppress commodity prices, and implement decisively, without further hesitation.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Over Two Thousand Workers Regain Freedom: Electricity Strike Resolved: Company Announces Workers to Quickly Return to Work: Leaders of the Strike Arrested and Brought to Justice: Mayor Qian Announces Handling of the Incident <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The electricity strike at the Municipal Electricity Company had been deadlocked for many days. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, after workers' families went to the factory to request the union to release the workers to return home for the New Year, a conflict occurred inside the factory. The police bureau sent police to suppress it, and all the workers left the factory one after another. The company also announced post-strike measures. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sincerely Persuading a Few Trouble Makers</p>
<p>The company's strike began on the 23rd of last month. The workers did not make demands to the company but immediately went on strike. Committee member Wang Xianqing of the Municipal Party Department and others went to the factory to persuade them, but it had no effect. The workers also refused to send representatives to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. After the newly appointed Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau took office, he believed that the electricity company was a public utility, and the municipal government had long issued an order prohibiting workers in public utilities from going on strike or slowing down work. This situation could not be allowed to continue, so he ordered the factory workers to send representatives to the bureau for mediation. On the 30th, the factory sent Ouyang Zirun, Huang Hongxun, and others to the bureau. The other five public utility unions also sent representatives to jointly persuade them. After Director Wu and Special Commissioner Lu Jingshi of the Ministry of Social Affairs and others sincerely persuaded them, the opinions of labor and management were close to converging. Ouyang and others were deeply moved and expressed their determination to take full responsibility and persuade the workers to return to work. However, when Ouyang and others left the Social Affairs Bureau, they suddenly changed their minds, refusing to allow representatives of the other five public utility unions to go with them to persuade the workers. At the same time, after returning to the factory, they did not convene a meeting of all the workers but only held a meeting of the board of directors and supervisors, still advocating continuing the strike, and some even advocated cutting off the power to coerce the company.</p>
<p>Prohibiting Action, Workers Resentful</p>
<p>Since the company's strike began, the union organized patrols to prevent workers from going out. At the same time, all the workers were organized into groups, with names being taken at any time to prevent workers from leaving. Most of the workers believed that food and clothing in the factory were inadequate, and many fell ill because of the cold weather. However, because of the strict supervision of the patrols, they could not move freely and were extremely resentful. Those who expressed dissenting opinions and advocated returning to work were beaten by the patrols or insulted in public. Some even suffered mental breakdowns due to nervous stimulation. After the workers' families learned of this, they requested military and police agencies to rescue them. Here is a copy of a document presented by dozens of people, including Mrs. Yin Wang and Mrs. Yang Le, to the Garrison Headquarters on the 29th of last month: "We, the undersigned, have family members working at the Shanghai Electric Power Plant in Yangshupu. On the 23rd of this month, they were ordered by the union to stay in the factory and strike. It has now been six days and nights. They are sleeping on the cement floor in the factory at night without blankets, which has led to mutual infection and illness. The strike committee absolutely prohibits workers from going out, and even for special leave, it is only limited to two or three hours, which really hinders personal freedom. Therefore, we submit this document to your department, requesting you to find a way to rescue them. This would be a great kindness."</p>
<p>Families Petition, Conflict Occurs</p>
<p>After receiving the presentation, the Headquarters forwarded it to the Municipal Government for investigation. While the Municipal Government was handing it over to the Police Bureau for investigation, around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, more than a hundred family members of the workers, believing that the workers had been on strike for a long time, their bodies were exhausted, and the New Year was approaching, urging reunion, went to the factory in Yangshupu to petition the union, requesting the workers to be allowed to return home. However, the union resolutely refused. The workers inside the factory could no longer bear it and resisted, resulting in a conflict with the patrols. The order was temporarily disrupted, and two or three people were injured.</p>
<p>Police Suppression, Workers Released</p>
<p>After receiving the news, the Yangshupu Police Bureau immediately sent police to suppress the situation and maintain order. The patrols refused to obey and obstructed workers who voluntarily wanted to go home. The police arrested the ringleaders. At this point, the workers inside the factory were as if they had been granted amnesty, joyfully leaving the factory with their wives and children to return home. The workers in the power generation engine room remained in the factory to continue working and maintain electricity. A dispute was quickly resolved, and order was restored. Furthermore, the police bureau also arrested Ouyang Zirun and Huang Hongxun, the leaders of the union, who were negotiating at the Social Affairs Bureau at the time, believing that Ouyang and others were responsible for instigating and manipulating the strike from the beginning. They will be transferred to the court within 24 hours for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Company Notice: Quickly Return to Work</p>
<p>After the workers left the factory, the company issued a notice, the original text of which is as follows: (1) All employees of the company should return to their original positions and work immediately. (2) The disputed points (including seniority-based salary increases) have been submitted to the Municipal Government for arbitration. (3) Employees of the company's accounting department were forced to strike and were unable to settle salaries and wages before the New Year. However, in order to take care of the employees' needs for the New Year, they will be allowed to receive an appropriate advance payment on February 1st. It is heard that the company also expressed its willingness to accept the workers' reasonable demands as much as possible, in order to promote harmonious relations between labor and management and jointly seek the development of business.</p>
<p>Mayor Explains the Handling of the Incident</p>
<p>Mayor Qian issued a statement last night regarding the electricity strike, the original text of which is as follows: "The employees of the Municipal Electricity Company initiated a strike due to the company's dismissal of Shen Han, a worker who was stealing electricity. They gathered more than 2,800 workers from various departments at the Yangshupu factory, organized patrols, prohibited workers from taking action, and hindered personal freedom. The workers' representatives, Ouyang Furun, Huang Hongxun, and others, put forward eleven demands. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned both labor and management for mediation. The management invited the responsible persons to the meeting, but the workers strongly demanded that the management personnel go to the factory for negotiations and refused to attend. After the newly appointed Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau took office, he repeatedly and earnestly ordered them to resume work and conduct mediation. Although the representatives complied with the order and attended the meeting, they still did not inform the workers to resume work. On the one hand, they made various unreasonable requests, forcing the management to accept them. Director Wu repeatedly advised and ordered them to resume work. The representatives pretended to obey, but in fact, they never complied. On the 30th, Director Wu personally attended the mediation. The representatives expressed their acceptance and stated that they would be responsible for guiding and complying with the order to resume work. At that time, the representatives of the other five public utility workers were deeply moved and were willing to go together to guide them. However, as soon as they left the Social Affairs Bureau, they made excuses and refused. It was reported that after returning to the factory, they did not convene a general meeting but only held a meeting of the board of directors and supervisors to oppose resuming work. At 10:00 AM on the 31st, the union's board of directors and supervisors convened a general meeting and forced the workers not to go home. At the same time, the Municipal Government received a complaint from the families of the workers, including Mrs. Gu Wang and Mrs. Yang Le, requesting the rescue of the workers detained by the union's patrols. The words were urgent. In the afternoon of the same day, according to a report from the Yangshuqing Police Sub-bureau, after 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the families and relatives of the workers gathered at the factory gate, requesting the release of the workers to go home. Some of the detained workers wanted to go out but were forcibly stopped by the patrols, resulting in a dispute. I immediately ordered the police bureau to go to suppress the situation, but the patrols refused to obey and still obstructed workers who voluntarily wanted to go home. In view of the above-mentioned illegal acts, I ordered the police bureau to arrest the representatives who instigated and manipulated the workers, Ouyang Zirun, Huang Hongxun, and those who disturbed the order on the spot, and send them to the court for legal proceedings. Currently, the detained workers have all returned home separately or are working as usual.</p>
<p>Harm to Order, Hindrance of Freedom</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the electricity strike, the Municipal Government has made repeated efforts to mediate, and has done its best to persuade the management to accept all reasonable demands put forward by the union. At the same time, it has advised the workers to respect national laws and resume work immediately. Unfortunately, the workers of the electricity company were manipulated by a few employees, not only being fickle but also making endless demands. The workers formed so-called patrols, detained workers and prevented them from working, and obstructed the military and police from maintaining order. Their actions went beyond the scope of the law, not only endangering social order but also directly hindering the freedom of the workers themselves. In addition to arresting all the people today and immediately sending them to the court for legal proceedings, I deeply hope that the company's workers will resume work as usual immediately. As for the various demands originally put forward by the workers, they will still be handled according to law. The Municipal Government has always maintained a fair attitude towards labor-management disputes, handles them reasonably according to legal procedures, and will never be partial. In the future, if anyone engages in unauthorized strikes or slowdowns in violation of the regulations, for the sake of stabilizing social order and maintaining the welfare of the people, they will be strictly dealt with and not be tolerated in the slightest."</p>
<h3 id="e51">Most Labor Strikes in Various Industries Resolved: Only Cantonese Cuisine Industry Has Not Achieved Results <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Labor strikes in various industries have generally become calmer. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The strike at the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury was completely resolved yesterday, and the Evening Post was published as usual yesterday. During the negotiations between labor and management, representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau mediated, and the management expressed acceptance in principle of all the demands put forward by labor.</p>
<p>(2) The employees of the main and branch stores of Zhengwei Pharmacy went on strike. After the Social Affairs Bureau mediated once, in addition to the two conditions put forward by labor, such as adjusting salaries and not dismissing employees without reason, the management indicated that they might accept them. Yesterday, the two sides were close to agreement on the year-end bonus issue, so all employees resumed work yesterday.</p>
<p>(3) The labor-management dispute at the British-owned tram company in the city was still being mediated by Wei Chenghao of the Social Affairs Bureau at the bureau yesterday. The management representative, Fang Aishi, and the labor representative, Zhu Yongye, and four others, were present. It was only resolved from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. The following is an excerpt of the various conditions: (1) Adding one person to sell tickets on the trailer, to be implemented within one week. (2) Working hours not exceeding eight hours. (3) Each day each conductor (太平賞） buys in each has twenty yuan, the head of each band eight yuan (班頭各八十元). (4) Employees' sick leave, after being certified by the company's doctor, will be paid salary as usual, and medical expenses will be paid by the company. (5) Raising the base salary will be submitted to the municipal government for decision. (6) Retirement benefits will be handled according to the decision of the electricity company. (7) Internal workers will receive one day's pay upon promotion. (8) Road workers salary to increase .2 from $.5.</p>
<p>(4) The China Silk Mill was originally taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Now it has been transferred to the China Silk Company. More than 200 unemployed male and female workers in the factory flocked to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. After the association sent representatives to mediate, it was decided to officially start work on February 7, adding 45 workers, and then adding 45 workers on February 21, and all will resume work by the end of February.</p>
<p>(5) The slowdown in work in the Cantonese cuisine industry continued to develop yesterday because the management still had no reply, and several companies, including Hongkou Zhangji, joined in voluntarily. In order to seek an early resolution, the labor side sent a letter to the union urging the management to resume negotiations, but as of now, the management has still not expressed any opinion, so work cannot be resumed today.</p>
<p>(6) The workers of the China Chemical Industry Cooperative demanded a year-end bonus. Yesterday, Zhou Tianpeng of the Social Affairs Bureau summoned both parties for mediation. Because the lunar new year was approaching, it was too late to make a decision, so the management first lent each male worker 50,000 yuan and each female worker 40,000 yuan, and the amount would be decided after the lunar new year.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Changes in Municipal Government Personnel <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>

<h3 id="e58">Strengthening Defense Forces: Increased Amusement Tax to Be Implemented Starting Today <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>To strengthen the defense forces, the municipal government and local figures have jointly established the National Defense Corps. In addition to seeking separate means for raising temporary expenses such as uniforms, the necessary recurring expenses were requested to be borne by the government through the Defense Committee. However, municipal expenses are vast, and tax revenues are insufficient, making it necessary to seek additional funds to cover them. After investigation, the amusement tax rate, according to Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the central government's promulgated Ordinance on Banquets and Amusement Tax, should not exceed 50% of the original price. The current rate is 30%, so a reasonable increase can be made. This was resolved at the 17th municipal meeting on January 18th of this year, following central government regulations, setting the rate at 50% of the price, still collected by the entertainment industry, effective from February 1st of this year, with 20% allocated to strengthen the development of the Municipal National Defense Corps.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, due to the lack of standards in business automobile rental rates, has specifically unified and approved the following rates: Passenger cars: 1,200 National Currency per trip, calculated in 20-minute increments, with an additional 250 yuan for every 5 minutes exceeding the limit. Freight cars: 2,400 yuan per trip, calculated in half-hour increments, with an additional 400 yuan for every 5 minutes exceeding the limit. These rates will be implemented from February 1st of this year, and no extra tips may be charged. The Bureau has already notified the City's Taxi Association and the Freight Car Association of the above measures, instructing all automobile companies to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e60">UNRRA to Sell Part of Its Supplies, Proceeds Still to Be Used for Relief <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to Shen Weitai, Director of the Translation and Compilation Department of UNRRA, to reporters, UNRRA will sell a portion of its supplies on the market, and the proceeds will mainly be used for emergency relief and public assistance. Furthermore, for inland provinces such as Shanxi and Henan, where transportation is inconvenient and relief supplies cannot be transported in large quantities, the emergency measure is to convert the supplies into cash and remit them.</p>
<p>Processing and Modification Also Require Cash</p>
<p>Also, some of the special supplies allocated to China by UNRRA need to be processed and modified before they can be distributed. The cost of this processing and modification also requires cash, so it is necessary to sell a portion of the supplies, and the proceeds will still be used for post-war relief. As for the clothing donated by foreigners, because the donors specified in advance that the beneficiaries should receive them directly, containing commemorative significance, and because some of them are not suitable for men to wear, they still cannot be sold, but will be directly distributed.</p>
<p>Medical Experts to Lecture in Shanghai</p>
<p>Nine foreign medical experts hired by UNRRA, including Dr. Kilmon, previously assisted China in training medical personnel in Chongqing. They will arrive in Shanghai one after another at the end of this month and plan to give public lectures in Shanghai starting on February 9th, discussing the latest medical inventions and new advances in medicine. The nine experts each have their own specialties, and the lecture topics include maternal and child health, public health, nursing, orthopedics, tuberculosis, internal medicine, nursing administration, bacteriology, thoracic surgery, and medical experiments. In recent years, Shanghai has been isolated from Europe and the United States, and the medical community is eager for new knowledge. It is expected that this academic lecture will provide new insights to the city's medical community. UNRRA is currently preparing to host the experts, and the time and location of the lectures will be announced by the organization in the coming days.</p>

<p>Although the work of American troops returning home after their service was temporarily concluded in mid-December of last year with the closure of the US Army Withdrawal Service Group, the US government and the headquarters of the US military stationed in various locations continue to consider the issue of their demobilization from time to time. In addition, when the US Senate inspection team and US Secretary of the Army Patterson came to China, 700-800 American soldiers here who requested retirement submitted a petition, prompting the US side to take action on the demobilization issue as soon as possible. However, when US Secretary of the Army Patterson passed through Shanghai, he solemnly stated that no matter to what extent the US military demobilization progresses, the US military's policy toward China will remain unchanged, as the United States has a fixed direction in its policy toward China. At the same time, General Wedemeyer also repeatedly stated that all American troops sent back to their country will be replaced by new troops to take over their work. According to US military sources, starting in mid-month, qualified American soldiers will have the opportunity to return home, with officers and soldiers prioritizing based on their service points and time. At the same time, Washington is also considering how to send another batch of American troops to work in China.</p>

<p>Yang Linsen, an employee of the Sino-American Japanese Daily News, encountered three British military officers who had escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Qingpu County, 50 kilometers from Shanghai, in January 1941. Yang risked his life to escort them to a guerrilla area, from where they were transferred to the rear. After the victory of the war, Yang wrote to the British Consulate to inquire about the whereabouts of the three men. Recently, he received a reply from Major Brett, the liaison officer of the consulate, stating that "the three officers have safely returned to London and express their infinite respect and gratitude to Yang for his rescue."</p>

<p>The annual National Highway Conference was held in Nanjing from December 20th to 15th. More than 50 representatives from 16 provinces attended. Minister Yu Hongjun and Deputy Premier Weng Wenhao attended the closing ceremony. Detailed studies were conducted on national highway issues, especially the division of national and provincial highways and the establishment of engineering standards. On the 27th, more than 40 representatives from 12 provinces came to Shanghai for sightseeing and were scheduled to return to their respective provinces in four or five days. During their stay in Shanghai, in addition to being invited by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to visit the city's public transportation facilities, the Municipal Public Works Bureau also invited the representatives to visit the city's various public works factories at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. More than ten people, including Xu Xingcheng, Yang Bing, and Li Wuqiao, visited various factories, such as the sewage treatment plant, where they observed the process of clearing sewage. Not only was this experience novel for the visiting guests, but it was also rarely understood by the city's residents.</p>
<p>Rock Crushing Machines Have Extremely High Output</p>
<p>The Xiamen Road Machinery Factory repairs all the Public Works Bureau's vehicle parts, road machinery, motors, and other equipment. The work inside is very fast. A road roller is being repaired and will be ready for use in road construction after completion.</p>
<p>There are three rock crushing machines in the Kader Road Rock Crushing Factory. Although they are more than 20 years old, their efficiency is still considerable. Large stones are transported from Suzhou, Hangzhou, Songjiang, and other places, and then placed one by one into the mouth of the rock crushing machine. Once powered on, the large iron cylinder lying horizontally on the rock crushing machine rotates. The cylinder wall is divided into small holes of 1.5, 1, 0.5, and 0.25 sizes. The crushed stones are sieved out according to their size from the holes. With this production method, 100 cubic meters of stones can be produced every day. However, the consumption is very high. The sand and gravel used by the Public Works Bureau for road construction, machinery repair, and house building are all borrowed from the rock crushing factory. The asphalt plant next door refines asphalt. The old asphalt dug up from the roads during road repairs is not discarded. The asphalt plant combines it and re-refines it, and the residue can still be used for other purposes.</p>
<p>Sewage Treatment Works Well</p>
<p>Many people think that the waste in our regular flush toilets is simply flushed into the sewers and flows into the rivers. In fact, the process is not that simple. The situation is slightly different in the former French Concession and the International Settlement. In the French Concession, there is a circular iron cover next to the alley or road, which is the storage pipe for the waste from flush toilets. After a small-scale adjustment, solids often evaporate into gas and escape, while liquids flow into the sewers and into the rivers. In the International Settlement, there are currently three sewage treatment plants. The sewage in the Dixwell Road and North Sichuan Road area flows to the Bazilu plant. The area east of Henan Road flows to Yangshupu. The area west of Henan Road flows to Beixinjing. This route is 30 miles long, which means that the excrement of those living west of Henan Road must travel 30 miles to reach Beixinjing.</p>
<p>Solid Waste Can Be Used as Fertilizer</p>
<p>There is a small house painted in cream and green on the sidewalk at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road, which people find inexplicable and may think is some kind of electrical installation. Originally, this is a very large sewage station and pump, which is the main pipe. There is one such facility every three miles. Each time the water is pumped, three gallons of water are needed, so the waste reaches the bottom and becomes liquid. When passing through the water storage station, the pump can raise the water and help it move forward. After passing through ten times, it reaches the final large pump at the Beixinjing Treatment Plant. There, four million gallons of water can be pumped every day. The water is then sent to more than ten pools, and the power of the generator adjusts the air, so it is constantly flowing for twenty-four hours a day. In winter, it takes about fifteen to eighteen hours for the sewage to be treated to a relatively clean level before it is transferred to another pool. After a waterfall-style water flushing, it flows into the Suzhou River, which can prevent sewage and wastewater from flowing into the river and affecting sanitation. It is said that in summer, after six hours of treatment, the sewage becomes extremely clean water, several times cleaner than the water in the Suzhou River. As for the remaining dirty water, it is flowed into many other pools, with more than 30 pools rotating to settle and dry, which can be used by the villagers as fertilizer for farming. The results of chemical experiments have shown that this fertilizer is more nutritious than untreated fertilizer. Rainwater flows directly through the ditches. There are currently five completed rainwater weirs, and the largest sixth weir, the Maigen Road weir, is being repaired and is scheduled to be completed by the end of June. The floods this summer can be avoided as a result.</p>
<p>Finally, we visited the sawmill on Qimei Road in Jiangwan, which uses the machines formerly used by the Japanese to make plywood to saw practical wood blocks. The sizes are different and there are specified dimensions. On average, 8,000 board feet of wood can be sawn every day, each board foot being one square foot in area and one inch thick weighing three pounds. The wood used by the Public Works Bureau is sawn from this factory.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Aftermath of the Electrical Workers' Strike <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The strike by the Shanghai Electric Power Company's workers has lasted for nearly a week and only came to an end yesterday afternoon, but it cannot be said to have been completely resolved. Based on various reports, we would like to offer a few suggestions regarding the aftermath of the electrical workers' strike.</p>
<p>This strike could have been resolved easily from the beginning if both labor and management could have accepted the government's mediation. Unfortunately, the union was controlled by a few people, and the workers' free will could not be expressed. This eventually led to a conflict between the workers' families, who were approaching the end of the year and wanted the workers to come home, and the "security team." The municipal government had no choice but to take decisive action. This shows that whether the workers' demands are justified is one thing, and how to achieve reasonable demands is another. First of all, we hope that the future Electrical Workers' Union should learn from the past and, within the legal framework, seek benefits for its members.</p>
<p>The Electric Power Company's willingness to mediate is commendable. However, according to the labor side, the point of contention this time was the unfairness of the seniority-based salary increase, and secondly, that some of the points previously mediated by the Social Bureau were not implemented by the management. We are not in a position to easily judge the content of the conditions, but it must be said to the management that salary increases and other matters should be fair, as slight unfairness can easily lead to disputes. Furthermore, the conditions that have been mediated and accepted should be strictly adhered to and implemented in order to eliminate strikes. Therefore, when the authorities continue to mediate in the future, the management must not think that the workers have already left the factory and can no longer pay attention to the labor's reasonable demands. They should still adhere to a legal stance and abide by the government's reasonable judgment.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to say a word to the government. The municipal government's attitude this time was to mediate fairly, do its best to persuade, and take legal action to maintain order and protect freedom. All of this has been praised by Chinese and foreign citizens alike. We hope that the government will quickly transfer the few workers who coerced the strike and disrupted order to the court for trial in accordance with the law, while continuing to mediate the legitimate demands of the labor side in a fair manner. In particular, we hope for a speedy and reasonable solution so that the social community and the general workers can understand that the government is upholding the interests of workers within the legal scope.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Vigorous Sales in Silver Shops; Gold Prices Reach New Peaks; Market Transactions Relatively Quiet <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, most speculators had already settled their accounts for the year, and those in the trade were not very active. As the year draws to a close, various businesses have squared their accounts, and remaining idle funds continue to be absorbed. Therefore, bullish traders disregarded the rush to sell at high prices. The effect was a sparse trading volume, with a wide gap between buying and selling prices, fluctuating rapidly. In addition, silver shops saw surprisingly strong sales, repeatedly circulating in the market to maintain inflows. Scattered buyers returned from all directions, and the market was generally flat. After opening, it briefly retreated to 1,060,000 [currency units], but silver shops then began buying, pushing it to a new high of around 1,185,000. As the US dollar failed to surpass 17 [currency units], short selling and selling from various sources caused the price to fall back below 1,100,000 by noon. Silver shops raised the price of gold jewelry to 120,000, and demand was very strong. There were still scattered price increases in the afternoon, hovering above 1,130,000 after 4 pm. Trading was extremely quiet, but still 30,000 better than the previous close. Silver shops quoted 120,000 for gold jewelry, 1,000 [currency units] for refined silver, and silver dollars slightly decreased from 630 to 650 [currency units]. (After 5 pm, silver shops raised gold prices again by 2,000, and refined silver and silver dollars also increased.) The interest rate for unsecured loans was around 1.5%, and the interest rate for New Year's funds was around 1.8%.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Continuous Supply of Spot Goods; US Dollar Lacks Momentum to Rise <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The US dollar, lacking short-covering opportunities, did not experience the same dazzling performance as gold. Furthermore, there were rumors that a new exchange rate would be announced within days, limiting the time for speculation. Without gold purchases boosting buying interest, a price decline was feared. After opening in the morning, it fell below 1,580 [currency units], but then gold prices began to soar again, pushing the short-covering price above 6,800 [currency units]. It briefly recovered to around 1,690 [currency units], but then declined again in the afternoon, following the gold market. Although gold prices rebounded in the afternoon, the US dollar failed to gain traction due to the influx of spot goods. As a result, it closed slightly lower, down by 10 [currency units]. Hong Kong currency was initially weak but then stabilized. New currency briefly fell back to 70 [currency units], but then slightly recovered, closing down by 5 [currency units] for old currency and 4 [currency units] for new currency compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Stock Transactions Few but Market Prices Rise Across the Board <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>At the meeting place for Chinese stocks, a small number of people continued to be active. Prices were initially low but then rose. Wing On Spinning initially fluctuated around 1,900 [currency units], and American &amp; Chinese Spinning around 1,430 [currency units]. King Fook briefly dropped to 91 [currency units], but trading was very thin. Unpopular stocks were favored by surplus funds and remained stable, with some even being quoted higher than the previous day. For example, Wing Hing Land at 60 [currency units] and Sun Yick Land at 40 [currency units] both saw buyers searching for them, and sentiment remained positive. Securities firms were slightly active, and the afternoon ended with high and new high prices. Compared to the previous day, Wing On Spinning was up another 110 [currency units], and American &amp; Chinese Spinning was up 50 [currency units]. The rest remained stable. The "three small" stocks saw some progress, but did not reach new highs.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks, stimulated by the new peak in gold prices, saw the lead of a major player, Mr. Yang, and the following of idle funds from silver and money businesses. Although foreign merchants sold at high prices, demand exceeded supply, and prices gradually rose, ending at high prices. Buying interest continued to permeate. Compared to the previous close, Ewo Spinning saw the biggest increase, up by one tenth, while the rest also rose, but not as much as Ewo Spinning. This was due to speculators concentrating on popular stocks.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Public Bonds Continue to Rise <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Most public bond dealers were resting, and a small number continued to bid higher. Class C bonds, absorbed by scattered idle funds, rose from 1,900 [currency units] to a new high of 2,050 [currency units]. At the noon close, Class A and B bonds were each up by 100 [currency units], Class C up by 140 [currency units], Class D up by 90 [currency units], and Class E up by 60 [currency units] compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Tight Spot Market for Yarn and Cloth <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the yarn and cotton cloth markets were closed according to custom for the Lunar New Year's Eve. However, off-market transactions saw some activity, and the market situation remained tight. Cotton transactions were still quiet, with factories making no purchases. Zhoupu seed cotton was reportedly quoted at over 10,000 [currency units].</p>
<h3 id="e80">Tea Market Sentiment Firm <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Red tea buds, favored by the Guangzhou merchants, continue to be in high demand. However, amid widespread accounting closures, sellers are generally taking a wait-and-see approach. As for chrysanthemums, the Guangzhou merchants are also accepting all offers. It is heard that they have absorbed quite a bit in recent days. Other varieties have been silent, but sentiment is quite firm.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Dyes Report Price Increases <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Various goods ordered by the merchants, such as Samsung D Grey, Great Bridge Vermilion, Five Horses Vermilion, Pagoda Superior Stomach Vermilion, and Black Indigo Powder, have all seen reported price increases of 10-20% compared to the market price. This is because after the New Year holiday, there may be shipping difficulties, and the order of cargo ships may also be restricted.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Tea Merchant Loans <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Reports) According to sources in the tea industry, the authorities are planning to consult with tea merchants about providing loans to aid tea farmers and revitalize Chinese tea exports. The amount is said to be considerable, reaching tens of millions of [currency units].</p>
<h3 id="e83">No Formal Market for Foreign Paper; Quotations Vary <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>As the deadline for closing accounts for the Lunar New Year approached, the foreign paper market closed yesterday. However, a few merchants were still making scattered purchases, but most firms were dealing directly with warehouses and not making transactions, resulting in inconsistent market prices. Quotations were high for customers, but there was no formal market price. It is difficult to predict the market situation next year, as the arrival time of orders is uncertain, and spot sales have largely concluded for the year. Furthermore, rumors about foreign exchange fluctuate, affecting the paper industry particularly severely. Therefore, both rising and falling trends are possible, and both buyers and sellers are afraid to act rashly.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Snippets <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>

Although people were settling accounts due to the approaching New Year, quotations rose again, with all goods up about 10% compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Daily necessities saw sluggish transactions with very little volume due to the approaching Lunar New Year. Fixed Root scissors soap prices rose, Phoenix matches were in short supply, and candles were stable.</p>
<p>Cosmetics market transaction essentially ceased trading and there were few transactions. Those holding goods followed the upward trend because of the high gold prices.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Factors Contributing to the Soaring Gold Prices <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— (Jing Zhi)</p>
<p>As the year draws to a close, businesses are preparing for the New Year. Gold prices have suddenly surged, with unprecedented fervor. It is said that "if it doesn't cry, it won't, but when it does, it startles everyone." Looking at the reasons, in accordance with China's ancient customs, after a year of labor, this year-end and New Year period is given greater importance. In addition to rural visitors buying New Year goods, many exchange gold jewelry at the big banks and silver shops. Given the instability of previous currencies, although rural farmers have limited knowledge, their distrust of paper money has increased in recent years. Fake currency is converted to legal currency, but prices do not fall but rise instead, causing deep suffering among the people. Furthermore, rumors about the "Sun Ticket" [currency issued by Sun Yat-sen] are circulating. For the sake of their hard-earned savings, women, rural women visitors in particular, are seeking security in silver shops. As silver shops' sales increase, they naturally look to the market to replenish their stocks. In recent years, various commercial institutions have used gold as capital, a phenomenon that is even more prevalent among speculators. In recent times, stocks and bonds have soared, and speculators have earned several times their investment. As the settlement period arrives, profits earned, as well as funds already used, must return to their source. Stock and bond prices have risen several times, so the rise in gold prices is considered commonplace. Once there is a change, people naturally rush to buy it. Furthermore, there are rumors that there are about 7,000 short positions in the gold market. Most of these people, seeing that there was unlikely to be a drastic change in gold prices in the short term, rashly sold gold to buy active and booming stocks and bonds. Today, their profits are undeniably substantial. Logically, they should have covered their positions early. However, because gold prices remained low, or they were greedy for high interest rates, or they were addicted to stocks and bonds, they waited for an opportunity to act. Now that the speculative wave has shifted, a large number of buyers are bound to come. A short squeeze is inevitable. The above three points are the main direct reasons for the rise in gold prices. In addition, the closing price of the gold market in Chongqing has exceeded the listed selling price, raising speculation that gold savings certificates will not be paid in cash upon maturity. The "mining ticket" is pegged to legal currency at a rate of 1,000 to 1, and visitors from the rear again speculate that the "mining ticket" is pegged to the US dollar at a rate of 3 to 1, based on the pre-war legal currency status. Old events resurface, and speculation about a new exchange rate of 2,000 or 3,000 is indirectly portrayed as plausible. Gold prices in various places are much higher than in Shanghai. The authorities have only ordered customs to ban exports as a response, stimulating the public's concept of hoarding gold. With the New Year approaching, financial leaders are conveniently staying in Beijing and Shanghai at this time, and everyone believes that it is very likely that a new exchange rate will be announced during this time. The amount of legal currency on the market has recently increased considerably, and idle funds are seeking outlets. Under the doctrine of exorbitant profits, retail investors are lured by the stimulation of the "red market." All of these are indirect factors that boost gold prices. As for the rumors, they vary from person to person.</p>

All professors and students are mostly from other provinces. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, teachers and students were eager to return home to visit their families, but lacked travel expenses. The school has now been approved by the Ministry of Education to end the current semester early, so that teachers and students can return home earlier. The travel expenses for teachers returning home are fully provided by the school, but they will still return to teach. As for the students, the school also handles it in accordance with the procedures set by the Ministry. It is now nearing the Lunar New Year, and the custom of the Yi people in Xichang to "kidnap Han people as slaves" is prevalent during this period. The school was almost disturbed by the Yi people last month, but fortunately the army arrived in time, preventing a disaster. The school has taken emergency measures, including moving the families of faculty and staff to the city, and asking the local garrison to be stationed at the school to be prepared. The school previously considered moving to Leshan, Sichuan, but the plan was abandoned because the Ministry did not approve it. President Lei Zuo is still working in Chongqing and will return to school this month. (Seal)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Primary and Secondary School Physical Education Teachers Research Association, initiated by Zhang Juefei, Liu Hesheng, Rong Shujian, and others, was originally planned to be established immediately, but it coincided with the school holiday period, making it difficult to proceed. Therefore, it was decided to postpone the establishment until after the schools reopen.</p>
<p>The famous soccer player Cao Qiuting travels frequently between Shanghai and Hankou. He happened to be in Shanghai last week, so he was able to participate in the Qingbai vs. Italian expatriates match. It was a loss for Qingbai not to see Cao's skills.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Aspects of the Southwest Associated University (Part Two) <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Huashi</p>
<p>Lifestyle</p>
<p>The lifestyle of the Southwest Associated University (Lian Da) students mainly involved "running," "throwing," and "grabbing." The meaning and scope of the word "running" is particularly far-reaching, such as "chasing girls," "running from air raids," "running to teahouses"... Originally, life would be monotonous if one only studied, so the pursuit of the opposite sex was as intense as studying. Some say that "chasing girls" is a manifestation of the depression and decadence of youth during the war, which is not entirely reasonable. What should be specifically mentioned is that their concern for national affairs was sincere and pure, as can be seen from wartime blood donations and translator recruitment.</p>
<p>Due to frequent air raids, running from air raids was indeed a troublesome matter. When the bombing was most severe, they had to run five or six times a week, and each run would last all day. They had to advance or delay class times. The Lian Da was bombed twice, and the library, classrooms, and dormitories for both male and female students were hit. Mr. Hua Luogeng was once buried in the mud raised by a bomb, but fortunately he was rescued. Although Kunming has suffered terrible bombing over the years, very few teachers and friends have been killed or injured, which can be considered a great blessing. During one summer vacation, the school was bombed, and Mr. Mei personally carried an oil lamp to rush to repair it day and night, enabling classes to start as scheduled, which proves their spirit of running the school.</p>
<p>Speaking of "running to teahouses," every teacher and friend of Lian Da will never forget Feng　Street, a street filled with horse manure all day long. Feng　Street, what a beautiful street name. On the one hand, it shows the bankruptcy of Chinese rural areas and the poverty of Chinese farmers. On the other hand, it reflects the spirit of the academic community struggling hard through the teahouses. The ragged and thick-necked country folks drove mules and donkeys, carrying bundles of heavy pine firewood on their backs, panting as they rushed from the countryside into the city. A sack filled with dry grass or sorghum was placed on the mules' and donkeys' mouths, and they chewed as they walked. Next to the mule driver was a coarse, rough-looking bag filled with cornmeal, without a single green vegetable or a trace of salt, as black as horse grass. They chewed as they walked. We don't know whether the horses were chewing the food that people ate, or whether the people were chewing the food that horses ate. Although the Chinese people were poor, it should be lamented that the rural people of Yunnan were even poorer. However, stimulated by the lens of poverty, the teachers and friends of Lian Da, regardless of the smell of horse manure, regardless of the jingling of bells and the sounds of horses' hooves, ran to the teahouse in groups of three or five, carrying books. When happy, they would buy some peanuts to chew slowly. The landlady would make a pot of tea and put out a plate of pine nuts. At first, they were not very welcoming to those who came to the teahouse just to read books. Later, more and more people came to the teahouse to read books, and they realized that it didn't hinder their business, so they got along peacefully. I remember that Mr. Luo Wengan often went to the teahouse with law students to lecture on Roman law. Who would have known that he was a well-known figure who had traveled a long way! The German Jewish Mr. Mies, who was exiled by Hitler and familiar with the terrain and geology of western Yunnan, sometimes sat on Feng　Street for an hour or two after returning from a geological survey. Mies lived a very hard life and worked extremely hard. I wonder if the foreign scholars are still in Kunming? Maybe he has returned to the Rhine to relive his shattered homeland. "Squeezing" and "grabbing" sometimes went hand in hand. The seats in the classrooms were limited, so sometimes you had to grab them. When the library opened, hundreds of students would squeeze at the door for the first ten minutes. As soon as the door opened, they would swarm in to grab seats. There were very few required books in the reading room. As soon as the door opened, they would rush in like a tide to grab books. Those who grabbed seats couldn't grab books, and those who grabbed books couldn't grab seats. Two people had to cooperate to achieve the effect of both arms. However, female students were sometimes an exception, because many escorts had already grabbed seats for them. It is said that the atmosphere of squeezing and grabbing has improved in recent years. Otherwise, the heat generated by the low-priced rice could not withstand several runs, squeezes, and grabs.</p>
<p>Wartime Contributions</p>
<p>Although the Southwest Associated University suffered from financial difficulties for eight years, professors were hired in stages, and students were undernourished, it fulfilled its due mission, directly or indirectly, to the motherland during the eight years of bloody war. It preserved the academic freedom and style of study. If China becomes a brand-new democratic country, academic freedom can promote democracy. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the level of Yunnan was not as good as that of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hunan provinces, the students' level was so shallow, and the people running the school were so perfunctory. During its eight years in Kunming, it cooperated with the Yunnan education authorities to run training classes to improve the quality of teachers, and some of the graduates engaged in secondary school education, injecting new blood into the poor secondary schools. Especially when recruiting new students, in the first few years, there were very few Yunnan students in the Lian Da. A historic university located in Yunnan had so few students from Yunnan, which stimulated them to catch up quickly. In this regard, the Lian Da made a special contribution to Yunnan. When the military situation in western Yunnan was tense, the teachers and students of Lian Da continued to sing and play instruments during the movement of people's hearts, which had an impact on stabilizing the rear. When the government decided to exchange professors with Britain and the United States, the professors Jin Long　, Chen Baoluo, Zhu Ruhua, Luo Xiaotian, Chen Xujing, and Rao　Tai of the Lian Da went abroad to lecture one after another, which had some power in academic cooperation. When the military urgently needed translators, the Lian Da took the lead in collective conscription, and these promising young people, entered and exited the hail of bullets, braved plagues, and fought against leeches, mosquitoes, and insects in the scorching heat and rain, using their energy and lives to deepen the relationship with the American army and accelerate the victory of the war. When the Kunming blood bank was established, the teachers and friends of the Lian Da enthusiastically donated blood. The undernourished students created the highest record of blood donation, which is indeed a good story in the Anti-Japanese War. For the sake of political rebirth and national unity, they used the highest enthusiasm, paid the greatest attention, and also exerted their greatest strength.</p>
<p>It has been three years since I left Kunming. I miss Kunming, I miss my alma mater. It transferred the tradition of freedom and style of study from the pre-war period to the wartime period, and then to the post-war period, from the cultural city of the north to the mountainous area of the southwest. It spent difficult years in wind and rain, and was able to flourish. It is about to become a noun on the past, but its spirit will last forever, and the people it has created will continue its consistent spirit and strive for the truth! Oh, my alma mater, my beloved alma mater! January 19, 35th year, in Chongqing</p>

<p>— Jutinger</p>
<p>When the darkness rushed in from all directions, the streetlights were particularly bright.</p>
<p>Who wants to listen to the ghostly sounds of the night, the symphony of the wind? Those wandering people inadvertently strolled into the charming "Paradise," and the mournful "Hou Ting Hua" seduced its sympathizers: merchants came, families came, rickshaws came, tricycles came, cars proudly flaunted their big bellies, and 八字　also came abruptly.</p>
<p>Very willing to give out money, squeeze in sweating, to silver their eyes, "Good!" and also shout to break their throats.</p>
<p>For a long time, the neon lights told everyone to come early tomorrow. It was another big squeeze, and a clear funeral song was played quietly in the theater.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<p>Wandering, struggling... Knowing it is painful and arduous, but for the sake of life, who is willing to leave their sweet and intimate hometown, abandon the warmth, and be in a cold and desolate foreign land.</p>
<p>Wandering, struggling... Knowing it is painful and arduous, but for the sake of life!</p>
<p>How many people are like this, how many people are selling their sweat and blood, it is the pursuit of life!</p>
<p>Encourage! Pursuers of life, let us go to life—to understand life, to learn to fight; to improve ourselves, to create a new life!</p>
<p>But he is for the sake of life! Knowing it is painful and arduous, wandering, struggling...</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>Where the wind rises, fallen reds scatter, where the wind rises, the twittering of birds comes; look intently, a moment is poetry, a moment is painting.</p>
<p>Where the wind rises, fallen leaves flutter, where the wind rises, the sound of autumn is bleak; look intently, a moment is poetry, a moment is painting.</p>
<p>Use a mysterious gaze, use skillful techniques, to blend it into spring and autumn.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Going to the Market <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Song Mu</p>
<p>When we lived in Fishing Street, there was hardly anything new in our lives. Only the two times a week we went to the market allowed us to dig out from the quiet and monotonous days and taste a trace of lively excitement.</p>
<p>On the days when we went to the market, we often got up very early. We groped our way up while it was still only dimly lit. We worried that we might be late. The house was full of vitality, smiling happily, and showing an unusual radiance in spirit.</p>
<p>We didn't have to worry about bad weather. The days in the mountain city were always so sunny and gentle. White fog filled the fields in the quiet morning, and the strong smell of soil permeated everywhere. Dewdrops formed on the grass on the suburban paths, round and moist. Looking up, there were stars twinkling in the light gray sky.</p>
<p>The market was not far from where we lived. Crossing a row of dense bushes, we could see clusters of crowded heads. The market was built on a flat dam, behind which was a yellow mud wall. It was said that it was originally a private mill, but now, apart from the dilapidated mud wall, nothing could be seen. There were originally not many families living in our village. The usual days were always cold and quiet, and it was rare to see one or two people. But today, as if by a miracle, everyone came out - adults, children. They had usually seen one or two faces or had never met before, but when they bumped into each other, they would exchange a friendly smile or greet each other kindly:</p>
<p>"You're up early!"</p>
<p>The other party would then greet back cordially, raising the bamboo basket they were carrying high on their elbow, or they would deliberately want to show something to the person they were talking to, taking out a few eggs from their cloth pocket and praising them to the other party:</p>
<p>"The eggs at the market today are really good, big and cheap. What are you going to buy?"</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, he had been crowded into the crowd by the people behind him. The already small earthen dam suddenly became more crowded with so many people. The merchants shouted loudly, and the butchers deliberately knocked the handle of their knives on the copper cans, making a clanging sound to attract customers. They did business with such friendliness. Of course, there were also disputes between them from time to time, but as soon as someone intervened, a pile of smiles would immediately appear on their faces. Look at how they were doing business:</p>
<p>"Boss, weigh four ounces of meat, the hindquarter."</p>
<p>"Okay, look, the meat was brought up from the southern countryside today, as fresh as can be."</p>
<p>"Just give a little leeway on the scale."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I'll give you a little extra, for the sake of our old business."</p>
<p>Finally, the buyer took it and smiled contentedly. He said to the shopkeeper in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Shopkeeper, I'm short on money today, so I'll put it on credit and pay you back in two days."</p>
<p>The shopkeeper immediately shook his hand as if he had been humiliated:</p>
<p>"What are you saying? Alas, four ounces of meat is nothing. Today I'll treat you, okay?"</p>
<p>The country people have such a simple and honest air. The market closed very peacefully. When the sun rose high in the sky, most of the people who had gone to the market went home with their bamboo baskets full and smiling. The earthen dam slowly returned to its former tranquility. In the afternoon, when we sometimes passed by there, we only saw one or two children playing. The ground was covered with leftover vegetable peels from the morning. Other than that, it was difficult for us to imagine the bustling scene of the morning. We had to wait for a few more days in a plain and dull life. We were looking forward to the next market day, hoping it would come soon.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Quiet <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Murong Sui</p>
<p>After scientists invented the principle of conservation of matter, they racked their brains in medicine, but so far there is no way to save mankind from the path of death!</p>
<p>The religious figures had already determined this point. They anticipated the failure of the scientists, so they exhausted their brains in religion, but achieving immortality is still like finding a needle in a haystack. They then thought of making a few more cups of sweet wine to make people walk the path of death in a daze, reducing a little of the pain of dying!</p>
<p>So far, there is no way to pull these poor humans out of death. Of course, they have no reason to cover up their failures!</p>
<p>However, the medical community is still holding on to that very thin rope, boasting of its omnipotence. In fact, that rope can only allow people to "stay a few more days" on the border of death; and the monks are still holding that cup of fine wine, boasting of their omnipotence. In fact, this cup of wine is just like "giving wine and food" to a prisoner about to be executed, just to embolden him.</p>
<p>We are really starting to feel a little tired! However, scientists are still gnawing on the dead man's bones of "conservation of matter"; religious figures are still drilling through the thick skin of "non-birth, non-death"!</p>
<p>I think this group of people gnawing on bones and drilling through thick skin should be quiet a little earlier so that those poor humans can lie down quietly.</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>This situation made Master Mo realize that what he had just said was not good for a child. At the same time, he was afraid that he would go and tell Madam Mo later. So he hurriedly tried to calm down and comfort Baoling, saying:</p>
<p>"Don't cry, child, Dad was talking nonsense just now, just joking with you, but don't tell your mother!"</p>
<p>"No! Dad! I understand." Baoling shook his head and sobbed. He was telling Master Mo: He understood the double meaning of Master Mo's words. Moreover, these words deeply affected his later life.</p>
<p>"Then, wipe away your tears obediently and go out to play!"</p>
<p>Baoling agreed and went out. Master Mo paced around the room for a while. At this time, he felt a little more comfortable. And he felt a little relieved by Baoling's understanding. He couldn't help but say to himself quietly: "As long as Baoling becomes successful, my life will not have been in vain!" Therefore, from then on, he regarded Baoling as his only sustenance in life, his only hope.</p>
<p>Mo Sheng came back with a bottle of wine and told Master Mo: Master Weng would arrive soon. Master Mo then became excited again and ordered Mo Sheng to prepare some dishes to go with the wine, as he wanted to drink with Master Weng.</p>
<p>Before long, Master Weng arrived.</p>
<p>Master Weng seemed to have just woken up, and walked into the study, yawning all the way.</p>
<p>"What, old brother, is the craving still not satisfied?" Master Mo greeted him and said.</p>
<p>"It's satisfied, but I haven't slept enough. You know, when Mo Xiong went, I was dreaming!" Master Weng said, sitting down. He shook a small white copper pipe out of his sleeve and puffed away at it.</p>
<p>"In that case, I've disturbed your sweet dreams! I'm really sorry!" Master Mo said, while shouting outside: "Make a pot of hot tea!"</p>
<p>"I heard from Mo Gan that elder brother has had a 'Joy of a Son' today, congratulations! Congratulations!" Master Weng said, spitting out clouds of smoke from his mouth, and watching with relish as the wisps of light smoke swirled and vanished.</p>
<p>"It's precisely for this reason that I invited you to drink together. Because there is no good wine at home, I remember the Wujiapi you had at your place the other day was very good, so I told Mo Sheng to bring it along the way. I'll ask someone to buy a few bottles in Hankou and return them to you another day," Master Mo said, feeling a little embarrassed. In fact, he didn't have the money to buy wine. Especially today, he couldn't ask his wife for money to buy wine.</p>
<p>"Don't mention it! If elder brother likes Wujiapi, I'll send you two more bottles later. Anyway, there are many more at home, and my alcohol tolerance is not high, so it's a pity to leave them there."</p>
<p>These words made Master Mo so happy that he immediately perked up! He loved wine, and wine had almost become his second life. In the past year, if wine hadn't often anesthetized him, he might not have been able to live for even a day! Wine made him forget the past; wine made him not think about the future; wine made him shamelessly continue to survive; wine saved him, and also harmed him! If someone asked him: Would you rather damage your health and die early because of wine? Or would you rather give up alcohol and stay healthy and live a few more years? He would definitely answer you without hesitation: I would rather die early because of wine than give up alcohol and live longer. Therefore, for everything else, Master Mo followed his wife's orders to change, but only "giving up alcohol" was something he firmly protested. No matter how much Madam Mo scolded, and even once smashed all the wine pots and wine cups at home, he still hugged the wine bottle and drank directly from the 酒坛子. Otherwise, he would slip out to sit in a bar. The only green jade ring he had on his hand was sold for drinking. Madam Mo never knew about this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhou Yixing wrote in a letter: The symphony of victory was passionately played in the streets of Shanghai not long ago. Now, we should embark on the beginning of national reconstruction. While there are many paths to national reconstruction, I believe that the New Life Movement initiated by our supreme leader Chairman Chiang should be vigorously implemented first. Our old way of life was too superficial and impractical, too cumbersome and extravagant. I believe that building the people's psychology is the foundation of building the country, and the New Life Movement is the best indicator of building the people's psychology. As the end of the lunar year approaches, the first day of the new year in the discarded calendar is imminent. During the New Year, we must exchange New Year's greetings with relatives and friends, and if we meet familiar children, we must give them New Year's money as usual. Such bad customs and habits, although they have existed for a long time, are ultimately too wasteful. Today is the era of the New Life, we must recognize reality, in other words, there is indeed a need to wash away the bad habits of the past. Because there are too many things to do in today's society, such as the student aid movement recently advocated by your newspaper, which is indeed the most urgent and practical work at hand. Two years ago, I had already stopped visiting relatives and friends for the New Year, and saved the New Year's money that should have been given, and in the past two years, I successively donated it to the Shin Pao and Sin Wen Pao student loan funds. Regarding this action, all my relatives and friends, or the children I love, forgive me and sympathize with me, which is the most pleasant thing for me. Now I still adhere to this purpose and continue to advocate, using the New Year's money I have prepared for this spring, totaling 100,000 national currency, to be dedicated to your newspaper's student aid fund. For me, it is just my way of doing things. I respectfully present my humble opinion, and I hope your newspaper will arouse compassionate voices, then I will be very fortunate.</p>

People from all sides have come to the association to inquire about the truth. According to the person in charge of the association, they had not contacted each other beforehand. When Tou Benri met with Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Wu also inquired about the matter and stated that the city's student loan movement should be unified, and the association's organization had not registered with the bureau beforehand.</p>

<p>Suggestion to Issue Round-Trip Tickets: Dear Editor: Recently, there have been few trains and many passengers on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, making it difficult to purchase tickets at the North Station and China Travel Service, resulting in overcrowding, theft, scams, and other sufferings that cannot be fully described. I believe that the transportation authorities should consider improving travel arrangements as soon as possible, such as issuing round-trip tickets at all stations along the line, valid for same-day use and invalid after the expiration date. Once implemented, all kinds of problems can be easily solved, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Not only will it be convenient for passengers, but the order at the stations will gradually improve. This matter concerns social welfare, so I hope you will publish it in your newspaper. Respectfully, Xu Bide from Kunshan</p>
<p>Ding Fubao's Calligraphy Couplets to Aid Education: Ding Fubao, a senior scholar in the academic world, has been diligent in learning throughout his life, and still practices calligraphy in his old age. However, few people outside can obtain his calligraphy. In order to promote the student aid movement, this newspaper has specially requested Mr. Ding to write 200 sets of couplets for all circles. Each set will be priced according to the usual fee for commissioned works, and after deducting the cost of paper and ink, the remainder will be used for student aid funds. Mr. Ding has always been enthusiastic about good deeds and especially likes to encourage and support younger generations, but he usually does not write calligraphy for money. Now he has made an exception to generously agree to benefit students, which is not a small matter. Mr. Ding's calligraphy is strong and profound, and in recent years it has become even more vigorous and ancient. Those who admire his calligraphy can obtain his work and also contribute to charity. The number is limited, so please do not miss the opportunity.</p>
