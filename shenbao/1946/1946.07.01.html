<h3 id="c1">彭部長宣佈政府文告　和平方針決不變更　始終相忍為國以促中共之反省　駐地問題必須先解決 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕六月卅日下午三時，中宣部彭部長宣佈如下：蔣主席於六月廿二日宣布，將停止前進追擊命令時效，延至六月卅日為止，在此期間，政府一再忍讓，以期建立和平統一之基礎，乃迄至今日，仍未獲得完滿解決，唯政府對共產黨問題，一本政治解決之方針，始終不渝，尤以我國八年血戰之餘，人民痛苦，火熱水深，不能使之重見戰禍，而美國政府特使馬歇爾將軍，為中國·為世界·蘄求和平之一片熱忱，更不能使之失望，以此政府仍請馬歇爾將軍繼續調解，期得和平解決，但中國共產黨，必須停止其軍事進攻與破壞交通之行動，以證明其誠意，並開誠切商整軍實施方案，與指定駐軍地區之協定，限期成立，則政府仍當曲予容忍，此一問題，如不獲具體解決，則其他各種協定，皆不能作有效之實施，尤其軍隊駐地，如不指定，則雙方部隊散駐原地，彼此不能隔離，種突仍無法避免，一月十日停止衝突協定之所以未生效果，甚至二月廿七日恢復交通協定之所以迄今未見實行，且破壞進行有加無已者，其故均在於此，斯乃半年來經過之事實，為中外所共覩者也，今停戰命令雖已滿期，政府對於和平統一之方針，决不變更，除非共黨進攻國軍，如最近在山東濰縣·大汶口，及山西大同附近等地之晝夜猛攻，則國軍不僅為自衛計，且為保衛人民生命財產與維持地方安寗秩序，職責所在，不能不加以抵抗與驅除。此外，中央軍隊不對共軍採取軍事行動，以靜候各項未決問題之解決，深冀此種相忍為國，力求政治解決之苦心，能促中共之深切反省，進而披瀝誠悃，成立協定；斯政府與全國人民之所厚望者矣。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕今下午三時，中央宣傳部彭部長學沛在國貨大樓宣部會議室內，向首都中外記者五十餘人，宣布國府蔣主席對共產黨問題仍一本政治解決之方針，力促中共反省，停止進攻國軍及破壞交通之行動，俾使遭受八年戰爭痛苦之人民，不再重罹戰禍之重要公吿。此項公吿首由彭部長宣吿本國記者，歷廿分鐘後，外籍記者湧至，再由彭部長於其辦公室內用英語宣吿外國記者，嗣因京滬各報記者絡繹而至，繼由許副部長孝炎將公吿原文重行宣吿於後來之本國記者，直至下午四時始畢。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三十日電〕今晨九時三十分，馬使曾赴主席官邸與主席長談二小時。使辭出後，主席旋召集政府各要員王世杰，彭學沛等，有所商談。又馬使於今午後二時許接見周恩來，並以主席忍讓為國，希望中共反省之意見，轉吿周氏。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京三十日電〕馬歇爾特使今日雖未能解決中國內爭，但能令政府保持現狀，繼續談判，此點則已成功。據政府方而稱：馬使不能無限期留在中國，此為談判中一個要因素。</p>
<h3 id="c2">中共代表團書面談話　謂願在馬使贊助下　繼續商談謀獲解決 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅日電〕中共代表團發言人，今日下午八時發表書面談話，略稱：長期停戰，全面停戰，原為我人一貫之主張，不幸未獲政府當局同意，致形成目前突兀不定之局面。在延期休戰八天中，關於完全停止東北衝突，恢復交通及解決執行部與小組中某些爭議等問題，均已獲得一般協議，而整軍方案之修正條款，經馬歇爾將軍努力，第三方面的熱心奔走，與中共方面的最大的讓步，本可完成初步協議，唯因政府方面堅持「無理要求」，致協議未成，吾人對此表示甚大遺憾。今日國民黨中宣部長彭學沛先生所宣佈的公吿，其形式甚為特別，一方面聲明中央軍不對共軍採取軍事行動，但並未說明政府方面是否已曾發佈此項命令，尤其未說明此種休戰狀態是長期抑是短期。但不管怎樣，中共方面仍堅持爭取和平，反對內戰的立塲，仍願在馬歇爾將軍贊助之下，繼續商談，求得政治解決。</p>
<p>周恩來之談話</p>
<p>〔中央三十日電〕中共代表下午八時舉行記者招待會，周恩來答覆記者稱：吾人答應在整軍時某些地方軍隊可以調用，但政府不以此為滿足，而欲中共撤出蘇北·熱河等地軍隊及政權，吾人實無法考慮與接受，渠繼述及馬使所提折衷方案稱：中共對其中極大部份及極重要部份均同意。渠並謂：今後繼續商談時，將採用三人會議及會外商談兩方式。周氏否認外傳共軍將撤出蘇北之說，並聲明共軍無向大同進攻意圖。</p>
<p>彭部長之答覆</p>
<p>〔本報南京三十日電〕周恩來於今晚八時舉行之記者招待會後，本報記者特訪彭部長於其寓邸，就詢對中共代表團所發表談話之意見。彭氏以簡潔之詞答曰：「共軍不進攻，我們自然不會追擊，我們沒有命令，軍隊自然不會向他們進攻」。此語亦即解釋停止追擊之命令，尚未失效，不必再有公事式之命令以壘床架屋，且此公吿達之於全國各報章通訊社，遠較命令為迅速也。</p>

<p>政府決心履行協議</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州三十日電〕關於東江共軍北運問題，廣州行營曾派王處長衡前往大鵬灣，負責處理一切。據悉：王氏於二十一日在葵浦與八小組及中共代表曾邀美方代表等開最後撤退會議，聲明政府履行協議之一貫決心，並令中共代表提出三項保證：（一）保證履行此後中共不再在廣東作武裝鬨爭，以報答政府對此次撤退之優遇；（二）保蹬依照名册北運及復員之忠實履行；（三）保證共軍在候船期間，不超越政府規定地區，至於控訴案件，在八小組離粵前，予人民以公開答覆。並由張長官應允：（一）在中共正式向八小組獲得指示後，准予再付一萬五千萬元；（二）大鵬半島候中共撤離後，國軍再行接防，足見政府對共軍之寬大。</p>
<h3 id="c4">京市警局通令　嚴禁擅捕人民 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京三十日電〕京臨參會為保障人民自由，向市府建議，逮捕違警人犯必須合乎法律手續，不得任意拘禁。此項建議已為市府接受，且已飭令各警局，自七月一日起，凡遠警案件必先以「違警裁決書」通知傳局訊問，不得擅行拘捕。據臨參會發言人稱：今後警察如仍有非法緝捕行為，巿民可依妨害自由罪，向法院控吿。</p>

<p>〔本報南京三十日電〕歷時二十三日之和平談判，截至今午十二時止，業吿一段落。商談經過，本報逐日均有詳盡報導。至談判結果，約如下述：</p>
<p>東北停戰問題</p>
<p>雖已獲致協議，但因東北整軍比例尙未確定，東北共軍駐區問題尙未解決，共軍雖有退出哈爾演之表示，但尙不願放棄中共在哈市旣成之治權及其獨特之經濟組織與租稅制度。</p>
<p>恢復交通問題</p>
<p>雙方對拆除碉堡，統一鐵路行政及交通警察之管理權，亦已獲得協議，但因有關撤退鐵道沿綫共軍之關內共軍駐區問題未決，致未簽字，現北平軍調部交通管理科美方負責人希爾上校，正會同政府及中共所派之交通代表，就視察津浦路山東境內各段情况，加以硏究，準備先行修復津浦膠濟兩路，據各方調查，當前恢復交通困難之癥結，厥惟共軍駐區之未定，共軍若不迅速撒離鐵路錢，復路工程即無法推進，此點美方已深切明瞭，不再相信派遣二三交通執行小組即可調處爭執，恢復交通，中共亦自承交通問題攸關軍事，不再裝腔作態，玩弄復路工程人員，加深此一問題之困難，政府對於必須撤退鐵道沿綫共軍之態度，甚為堅決，此事能否於最短期內解決，此時任何人均不敢預言。</p>
<p>整編統編問題</p>
<p>之談判經過，政府代表從未向外間透露一字，連日京滬各報披露之消息，則多半可靠，因各方均未公開否認，此一問題原極複雜，但經長期商談，精密硏究後，各方已了然和平能否實現，衝突能否避免，其困難不盡在整軍比例，而其癥結所在，則為共軍駐區之無定，一切突擊之禍根，均由於共軍迄今尙無一固定之駐區，譬諸頑童無家，和尙無廟，野馬無擼，則一切弄槍玩棒之行徑，自屬難免，故劃定共軍防區一事，實為富前之要圖，此一問題獲得合理之解決，共軍旣可小休，且因給養有着，衣食無虧，則一切問題均可迎刃而解矣。</p>
<p>中共所謂讓步</p>
<p>據今日某方透露：中共對東北方面已允撤出哈爾濱，對熱河察哈爾方面，中共願意放棄張家口以南地區，表示减輕平津之威脅，對蘇北皖東北，膠東，中共允酌减駐軍兵額，分批分期撤退，但須保留上述各地中共之政治經濟乃至社會旣得權益，簡言之，即上述各地中央委派之行政人員，小至一鄉保長，中共指導組織之人民團體，雖小至一理髮業工會，亦須保證其永久存在，此即中共人士認為過去談判八九月來最理想之「傑作」。</p>

<p>停戰令展期八天，昨日正午又期滿了。全國人民，正懸慮着和平有沒有希望，感到萬分焦急，蔣主席仍本其和平統一的方針，相忍為國，又發表了一次為舉國一致所歡迎的文吿，只要中共停止軍事進攻，停止破壞交通，開誠洽商整軍實施方案，限期成立駐軍地區之協定，則政府仍當曲予容忍。蔣主席明智的決策，完全證明了政府力求政治解决之苦心，使過去一部分中外人士懷疑政府用武者可以恍然大悟。今後中國是否能實現和平統一，也就得看共產黨真能深切反省與否了。</p>
<p>在政治協商會議前後的情形，姑置不論，單以最近一月的事實來說：政府為了民族國家的前途，不願錯過這千載一時的建國機會，始終抱着「相忍為國」的精神。六月六日頒布停戰令，限於十五天內談判解決停止衝突。恢復交通。以及實施軍隊整編統編方案三件大事。談判十五天，依然無結果，蔣主席為給共產黨以最後一個機會起見，乃將停戰令期限延八天，希望共產黨莫再錯過這個最後的機會。但在這最後的八天內，共產黨依然玩弄它最高明的手法，使談判拖延下去，得不到一個結論。口頭上說得很漂亮，實際上全不着邊際。以致時局明暗不定，弄得我們老百姓頭昏腦脹，好像逢到了一個時代的啞謎。到了昨天正午，停戰令滿期的最後一刹那，大家正提心弔膽，聽得蔣主席的文吿發表，如釋重負，我們老百姓怎能不表示欣慰！</p>
<p>但是我們在欣慰之餘，冷靜下來想一想，對國內時局的前途，覺得還不能樂觀得太早。為什麽呢？因為蔣主席的文吿，僅僅表示政府一方面願意不惜任何代價，爭取和平統一，而不願使人民重見戰禍。可是和平統一，單靠政府一方面的努力是不够的，而戰禍之是否可以避免重見，還須看共黨的實際行動。我們要注意「相忍」的「相」字，必須兩方面均能忍讓，才可算是「相忍」。如果單是政府忍而共黨不能忍，還是晝夜猛攻濰縣大同等地，則政府縱願「姑息」，而戰亂未必可免。所以中國今天反亂為治反戰為和的關鍵，可以說掌握在共產黨的手裏。政府愈寬大退讓，我們愈要勸中共早日覺悟，大家「相忍為國」，在馬歇爾特使繼續調解之下，成立整軍實施方案之協定。否則儘管蔣主席有這明智寬大的文吿，而共黨依然故我，人民的希望不是又要歸於泡影了嗎？今天願率直再奉勸共產黨一句：政府退讓一次，人民對共黨的不退讓必更厭惡一次。故目前的僵局如冉拖延下去，共黨如還不反省，改變它軍事進攻，破壞交通，以及割據地盤不肯接受整軍的作風，則共黨之在中國，無異自毀其前途。</p>
<p>我們綜合最近談判的問題及各方的意見，可以知雙方爭執的焦點，一個是整軍問題，另一個是防區問題。這都是軍隊國家化的實施步驟。關於前者，軍隊復員整編統編方案，早經三方面簽字成立，只要付諸實施就好了，共黨要求變更國共兩軍的比例，顯無理由可言。關於後者，共黨的意見，前後殊不一致，使我們對於共產黨的眞正意向，甚難索解。其實防區的劃分，是目前避免軍事衝突最切實的辦法，否則雙方部隊散駐原地，彼此不能隔離，衝突怎能保證避免？共黨如眞心求取和平，實在沒有拒絕指定防區的理由。</p>
<p>最後，講到政治民主化，當然是中國政治前途之之軌。我們雖然知道政府對於革新政治，固早有絕大的決心，政府蘄求民主政治之實現，亦確己定有步驟，但美中不足的，我們以為現政府還缺少一點自動自發實施民主化的精神。其實，共產黨的軍事進攻及破壞交通是一回事，而政府自動改組國民政府，容納各黨各派（願與政府合作而並不擁兵之黨派）及無黨無派之賢達，共圖治理，以示其「天下為公」之誠，却是另一回事。譬如政府裁併軍委會軍政部軍令部等等機構，而成立國防部，不失為一調整軍事機構之適時措置，但政府為什麽至今還不自動的改變行使政權的體制，將國防最高委員會的權力，移轉於容納各黨派及無黨派人士以後的國民政府委員會呢？政府應該不必問共黨之是否願來參加，而率先表示自動公開政權，一新耳目，以打開政治民主化的頭道大門。其次，政府在和共黨繼續談判時，也不妨反省一下，為什麼共黨竟會這樣猖獗，中央乃至各地的政治設施究竟有無授人以隙，被稱為培養共黨的「溫牀」呢？必須政府官吏，大澈大悟，根本上自動革新其政治，則共黨縱蓄意製造戰亂，必為人民所唾棄，其力量也就不必重視的了。故政府與其徒望共黨放棄其政策，不如回頭先改革其自己權力所及的政治，與人民更始。</p>

<h3 id="c35">超空堡壘自三萬呎高空　今晨投下原子弹　昨完成各項準備靜待氣候報告　目標艦船環列礁湖宛如一浮城 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社比基尼島外美艦阿派拉欽號上廿九日電〕參加比基尼原子彈試騐之人員約四萬名，各項準備均已完成，今日無事可做，僅靜待最後氣候報告之發表，以定原子彈是否將如期投擲。海軍發言人謂：氣候可望良好，但原子彈或將較預定時刻早一小時投下，俾使視綫更為淸晰。（上海時間星期一晨六時三十分，原定為七時三十分）今日將投擲原子彈之超空堡壘，施以最後檢查，發現其中一具引擎尙非盡善，立予掉換，試騐時原定　目標試飛三匝，今已決定取消，故正式投擲可提早舉行。轟炸機人員在三萬呎高空投彈之準確，已使主持試騐之長官感覺驚異，該超空堡壘之駕駛人史文克特少校吿記者稱：渠有把握可使原子彈擲在目標三百呎以內。機上除機員外，尙有陸空軍人員各一，及科學家一人，彼等將在空中裝配原子彈，以减少其危險性。</p>
<p>〔聯合社比基尼廿九日電〕原子彈試騐前夕，數千參觀者神經益見緊張，靜待投彈鐘點。鐘點一到，比基尼礁湖內將散放一千個太陽之熱與光。但在熱烈之人羣中，惟伍特少校力保冷靜，暫離新澤西州某商店職員之工作，來此担任美國陸軍最優秀之轟炸手之一。渠以自信之態度曰：「我將一擊中的」。</p>
<p>精密儀器　測量威力</p>
<p>七月一日之試騐參觀佈置業已就緖，惟以氣候許可為限。七十七艘兵艦環繞靶子中心艦「尼伐達」號，羅列礁湖中。試騐時將用分光設備，各科學家在第一分鐘內即可窺見全部爆炸情形，彼等可測量數百萬度之熱力及彈片之速度，各種儀器可充分測得炸彈之力量。就各艦排就之陣勢而觀，可知艦隊即使不被摧毀，艦中人亦將被炸死傷。全部艦船較大部份房屋更為堅固，爆炸發生時，艦底有水掩護，可使其大部份免成碎片。蓋原子炸彈為嚴格的陸上武器，此點不可不知。七月一日之空中爆炸方式，並不用以表示原子彈對於海軍之攻擊，而嚴格用以試騐攻擊城巿之威力，故各靶子船之停泊，幾完全與小城市相仿。各艦靠中心密集，如矗立之　天　然·中心區有軍賺二十餘　，形成一　，直徑廣一哩以上。中央軍　佈置尤為稠密，自兩哩外望之，不能看出各艦中間之空隙。此一浮城之佈置，一如舊式都會，由中央建築向四方分出街道。「尼伐達」號戰艦居中，但中央最高建築物則為日戰艦「長門」號，遠望如城市中聳起之塔尖。</p>
<p>尼伐達號　靶子核心</p>
<p>〔中央社記者宋德和在比基尼礁湖中美艦尼伐達號廿九日專電〕此一美國舊主力艦「尼伐達」號，將用作此次原子彈試騐所用目標船隻之中心，艦上備有各種樣式之軍事配備，上自坦克飛機，下至制服布料及食料。若原子彈投下後，依照預計者爆炸，則上述之各種配備及物資，均將入於原子彈所引起之白熱及放射作用中。今日各記者俱獲准往該艦參觀，然僅許參觀外表。外表酷似一現代之軍事科學博物館，內陳列坦克，大砲，水陸兩用車輛，飛機，尙有各種不同材料所製之各式飛機，交通工具，一英寸以內之裝甲鋼板，凡現代戰中所用一切物件，及新近發明而以前從未試用之各物，均將在原子彈爆炸下作試驗。在原子彈投落之數小時前，艦上人員即棄艦而去，而以猪羊及老鼠代之，此等動物，已在艦上，屆時將分置不同地點，其中若干之毛將剪短，亦有若干完全剪去，在其膚上作特殊準備。在此中心目標之週圍，尙有其他船艦七十餘艘，均與「尼伐達」作同樣準備，此等目標船碇泊極相接近，如所投原子彈爆炸情況恰如所理想者，則一枚炸彈，似即可將所有目標船完全擊沉，或重創。</p>
<p>日艦長門　權充炮灰</p>
<p>日主力艦「長門」號，巡洋艦「佐川」號，距「尼伐達」號僅數百英尺，船身極為殘破，由美海軍駕駛。德巡洋艦「歡琴親王」號，外形則極美觀。記者環顧此等集中之目標，並憶及遏去數星期來，美方對記者關於此次試騐準備籌劃情形之多次報吿，不禁感慨此等精力與熱情，何不用於平時生產方面？</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社舊金山廿九日電〕據聞美海軍部將從事長距離測量與紀錄，以證明世界其他都份之原子彈轟炸秘密試騐，是否能在美國測知。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿九日電〕美科學界保證原子彈之轟炸試騐與世界無損後，引起歐洲科學家之不滿。瑞士物理學家　卡特現在巴黎準備明年之深水壓力試騐，據稱：原子彈爆炸或將引起一連串不可遏制之原子爆炸。畢氏此言與前法科學家貝爾都里斯所懼者相合。據貝氏稱：水中亦有核心爆炸力量，與鈾子所包含者相同，故原子炸彈或可引起意外之爆炸。在大洋投擲原子彈之前，應先在小水面舉行有限制之試騐云。</p>
<p>原子炸彈　可破颶風</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿九日專電〕東京氣象觀察台氣象學家藤原平今稱：原子彈或可用以擊破颶風。藤原之理論乃根據廣島長崎原子彈所發生之現象而來。渠稱：廣島之第一顆原子彈投落後半小時，蔚藍之天空即變為陰暗，繼則起雨，一小時內細雨即變成熱帶性之傾盆大雨。長崎之第二顆原子彈投落後，亦產生同樣現象。根據理論，原子能確可改變氣候，若以原子彈（或另一形式之原子能）投於破壞性極大之颶風中之適當地點，則可使颶風轉向毫無損害性之別綫方向推展，普通之颶風威力，僅及原子彈威力之百分之一，故原子彈有充分力量控制颶風。</p>

<h3 id="c42">美原子彈製造處計劃　增產放射性元素　供全國醫學工業上用途 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社美國丹納西州橡樹巍廿九日電〕蒙哈頓原子彈製造工程處，今日發表以原子能供和平用途之計劃。自製造原子彈成分之同一「鈾原子灶」所產生之放射質，將分配於各醫院·各大學·及科學與工業實騐室，用以查察人體內所有各質，並硏究其構造與疾病，或且可供醫藥治療之用。目前祗有美國各機關可獲得分配，且在生產設備增加以前，尙未能全數供應。現在生產量雖屬有限，將來可望大規模製造，醫院·學校·工業及非工業實驗室及臨床研究專體，已可申請小量。如能增加生產，普遍分配，則於物理·化學·冶金·及醫學方面之平時研究，定可獲益非淺。據蒙哈頓原子彈製造工程處報吿：</p>
<p>鈾原子灶</p>
<p>之生產同位元素，遠過於原子分裂器，例如放射性炭，爲研究員所亟需，「鈾原子灶」之生產可數倍於原子分裂器。戰前用原子分裂器生產之同位元素不足，以致研究方法未能進展，應用放射性同位元素之人亦寥寥可數。今則放射性同位元素既可大規模生產，則於科學應用方面當可有更重要之進步。同位元素之生產費用雖多昂貴，但已可用相當價格獲得，重要同位元素之研究用量，其所需費用，已不致令普通科學機關望而却步。同位元素中有能每秒鐘產生三千七百萬射綫者，每一射綫有高至二百五十萬電子伏爾脫之能量，故其處理須特別愼重。一種放射質失去其一半放射能所需之時間，約自數小時至三十餘年不等。放射性同位元素之</p>
<p>重要用途</p>
<p>有二：（一）於化學生物學及技術上用作原子探　器，（二）用作特種疾病之治療劑。放射性同位元素所以能用作探尋器者，因其發出之放射物，可用精密儀器測知。故放射性炭可用以偵查普通炭質在人體及各種有機體之作用。放射性炭在人體內，並不妨碍普通炭質，因其化學上性質相同之故。放射性炭一四與稱定之炭一二二及炭一三有別，於研究各種有機體作用，包括正常與疾病組織之機精及生長，及一切動植物之功用，可以裨益不少。此外如燐·硫·碘等之放射質，其產量亦已較前為多。放射性　以前用原子分裂器所產生之量殊爲有限，今可用以治療白血病，即血細胞之癌性病症，因憐有集中於造血器內之趨向，故利用憐之放射質以攻擊其病狀，如用鐳錠與光然。放射性碘用以治療甲狀腺病，因碘將集中於甲狀腺內之故，亦可用以偵査，以決定所用碘質是否確在甲狀腺內。放射性硫與磺咹素藥同用，以之偵査此類藥物在體內之反應、及其對於</p>
<p>細菌作用</p>
<p>異常重要。放射性　可用以治療骨瘤，因科學家已知　易集中於骨組織內也。注射一種放射性物質於動靜脈內之一點，而計算其通過之時間·即可測量血流之速度。據陸軍部宣布：放射性同位元素亦可於工業化學及冶金學上作為價查之用。此在昔日用原子分裂器產生放射物質時即已知之。具此性質之放射質，可用以測知流過複雜之管子及反應器之氣體，煤油工程師用以測繪油池。放射性氫則用以測騐煉油手續。原子科學家稱、放射物質所發出之射綫，對於用</p>
<p>X光照射</p>
<p>大塊金屬及不透明質、以測其有無暇疵，為一價廉而易於運用之放射綫來源。現時產生之同位元素，可分兩大類：（一）為鈾二三五，由中子　擊而分裂之副產物；（二）以不分裂之物質，加入鈾原子堆內，受原子轟擊而變為放射質。在第一類鈾原子已被擊碎，而成一連串之新元素，此乃真正之鍊金術。但在鈾原子堆中，此新產之元素並不如天然所產之穩定，而且有放射性。由此產生之元素不下十六種，包括　·銪·　·　，　等在內。第二類在鈾原子堆中加入外物，可發生數種反應：（一）變非放射性元素為同類之放射性元素；（二）變非放射性元素為完全不同之放射性元素；（三）先變非放射性元素為同類之放射性元素，再分裂而成完全不同之放射性元素。加入鈾原子堆中之物質，先裝在特製之金屬器內，其手續異常精細，且須極度審愼。凡用放射性同位元素供基本硏究，或應用科學用之團體，應將其硏究所得加以刋布，以促進科學，。分配之法由同位元素顧問委會調整監督，至其生產與發展之調整，則由蒙哈頓工程處各大實騐室代表所組成之技術委會主持。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕菲律賓總統女公子羅比羅哈斯小姐，爲慶祝七月四日菲律賓獨立紀念，特自美搭乘「林克斯」號回國，於昨日下午四時半抵滬。到碼頭歡迎者有菲律賓駐滬獨立紀念委員會主席羅昌哥，美領事館副領事羅撒，吳市長夫婦代表市府交際科劉班業小姐，外交部駐滬辦事處代表高凌白，及此間菲僑數百人。</p>
<p>羅小姐是菲總統羅哈斯的獨生女兒，總統愛若掌珠。黃色的細髮，白析的皮膚，不高不矮的長度，瘦的身材，戴了一頂白色草帽，穿了白底紅綠花綢衣服，脚踏咖啡色玻璃　空高跟皮鞋，態度十分嫻靜，難怪那位特地自馬尼刺來接她的美海軍指揮官巴生（她父親的海軍顧問）事先就告訴我們她是一位極動人，溫文爾雅的小姐。</p>
<p>羅小姐今年二十四歲，有一位弟弟在馬尼刺騐書，她在大戰前就到美國念中學，珍珠港事變發生，回到馬尼刺，十個月前又到美國。現在美國凡塞大學研讀文學，今年三年級·愛好音樂，自幼就學習鋼琴，一九三七年開始學習豎琴。這次來上海已是第三次，第一次來的時候還祇有十三歲，那時可惜也祇耽擱了幾天。當問題起她畢業後將乾些什麼，羅小姐說：「我很希望能幫助我父親做些事。」</p>
<p>「一路上我急着着想再看見上海，可惜明天一早就要飛四馬尼刺。同時本來想來上海買些東西，現在天晚了，也來不及。」因爲羅小姐到得太晚了，菲僑預定下午三時在國際飯店的歡迎會也祇能取消，晚上由巴生指揮官爲之設宴洗慶。</p>
<p>羅小姐這次回馬尼刺是特地爲參加獨立紀念大典的，完畢後就再回到美完成學業，和她同行飛馬尼刺的有菲律賓教育部長加利可夫人等六人，及大拘小拘各一頭·此外搭「林克斯」號由美回國的菲人共有二百多人。</p>

<p>急謀增設</p>
<p>西藏路時疫醫院昨日收容形似患霍亂者四十餘人，死亡三人。自今日起，開始時疫門診，時疫病人患者不論貧富，一概免費，施診藥，不分晝夜，隨到隨診。該院自發現霍亂以來，已收治真懶得霍亂病人三百二十四人，患疑似霍及急性胃腸炎受監水注射者達二千餘人。關於各醫院病床之缺乏，現當局正謀補救辦法。近由行總上海分署捐贈活動木屋，正請款搭建中。國立醫學院必要時，可借用楓林僑中山醫院，並撥借床舖器材，及醫護人員，可望在最短期間，增設病床四百隻，仍待加緊籌備，迅速完成。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕抗戰前二年，江西龍虎山六十三代代張天師（恩溥）曾在上海大世界身說法，曾轟動一時。抗戰後，這位張天師也就悄然地回到原籍。</p>
<p>時間很快的過去，勝利終於來臨，而這位年近五十的張天師也隨着勝利後而又重來到了上海，這次的來，是爲了中國道教會的成立，所以到上海後，曾拜謁過吳市長，和各大居士及友教員負責人。</p>
<p>記者昨天碰到天師，曾和他談了半個鐘點，從這位天師口裏，知道了一些關於道教的一個概况。他說：「道教係根據老子學說，現在最高手就是「正一」派，下面還有「龍門」，「全真」兩派，這種派的唯一分別，就是「正一」可以穿便服，在家和出家並沒什麼兩樣，而「龍門」，「全真」則非留髮，着道服，吃淨素不可。」記者又詢以天師的封號由來，和龍虎山的情形以及有沒有所謂捉妖的法力？他正經地說：「從世祖道陵公被封爲天師起，到昨在已經二千二百多年了，但是在世祖前的我們最早的先祖，實在是張良，離開世祖還有九代，合起來一共七十二代。龍虎山在貴谿縣，離開浙贑路約五十華里，並不高，因左山形龍，右山形虎，所以名之。至於捉妖一說在山上確有許多降服妖孽的事實，但在科學昌明今日，吾人實無庸聲辦，終之道教是有正無邪，有益無害的一種真理，學說」。</p>
<p>最後他還告訴記者：世祖曾傅下了許多法器，書籍，經　和道德經等，另外還有二種無價之寶，一爲玉璽，一爲實劍，此次來滬，曾帶玉璽一顆，將來可能在上海舉行一個消災性的法事。</p>

<p>無綫電話開放時間</p>
<p>又該局爲便利國內通訊起見，前曾由南京電訊總局，在滬裝置無綫電綫台一座，因受路綫限制，僅開放重慶，台北，漢口，北平，廣州等五地，自前各地通話時間爲（一）重慶上午九時至十一時，下午八時至十一時，（二）台北上午八時至九時，上午十一時至下午一時，下午五時至六時，（三）漢口下午一時至三時，（四）北平下午三時至四時，（五）廣州下午四時至六時，近因該台機件障滯，未能暢通，頃正積極修理中，日內可望修竣。</p>
<p>裝置漢口長途電台</p>
<p>目前滬，漢兩地依賴電話通訊，甚爲股切，惟因滬，漢兩地通訊電話未能充分，通話甚爲困難，爲謀補救此項困難起見，該局日前曾裝置滬漢兩地之有綫電話，頃已裝置完竣，且曾一度試話，但話音未能清晰，現正加以改裝中，預期本月中旬可望正式通話。</p>

<h3 id="c68">中華音樂劇團加緊排演新戲　秋後赴美公演　籌募戰時孤兒基金 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣夫人贊助之下成立的中華音樂劇團，於秋凉後即將出國了。團員們在阿父夏洛穆夫先生的領導之下，近日正加緊排演。準備在赴美以前，至少排好四個戲——古刹　夢，孟姜婦，五行星，波光琴心，全由阿父夏洛穆夫先生編寫，作曲，前二個戲已經公演過，後二個還是新的。每個戲裏都洋溢義國業的優點，充滿了中國的情講，以這樣尙永清高的格調謂，来介紹中国古有的替俗，還屬邦交上的第一次，想必一定能够吸到多数盟邦人士的欣赏。記者爲了要明睡劇團内部的詳細情形，特地走向「逸團」他俐經常排戲的地方，作了一次訪問。</p>
<p>每天上午九時到十二地，下午三時到六時，這樣年青的團員便活躍在前跑鉻塲看台的平顶上，常記者走訪時，正看见他們各顯神通，在阿父夏洛穆夫領導之下，聚精會神地排紅練着。望着阿父夏洛穆夫銀白的頭髮，因着緊張的工作而上下波動，記者自然不能上前去打擾他。把團内的情形，詳細介駋給記者的，是該團的秘書兼總務楊榮基小姐。楊小姐是阿父夏洛穆夫十幾年的老朋友，這一次，她也将随着劇團同</p>
<p>赴美國。</p>
<p>全國團員三十五人</p>
<p>中華青樂劇國的宗旨是發楊中國音樂又化，他們此次赴美的任務是謂募戰時孤兒的基金。團员的人数已决定爲三十五人，其中二十六人爲演員，男女各佔其半，其他爲職员。該團聖演员的挑選非常嚴格，學問，儀熊，身體，行爲各方一面都须審查。最主要的還是要懂得申國的舞蹈，现有的團具中，多数皆爲票友。又正瀾亦爲其中一，他們曾號公開招考過，報名的人雖然非常踴躍，但是合格的極少，现在他们正繼續努力物色中。己經决定的有顧問沈志白（上海大學音樂采教授），副導演陳錘，歌　隊指挥黄永　，美術主任池寗，及王渊等数位演員。</p>
<p>中華音樂劇團的經費完全是由蔣夫人濟募得來的，外界盛轉係政府撥給，實在並非事實。勝利後，當蒋夫人首次来上海的時候，由於孫夫人的介招，在戰地服務團招待盟軍會上，蒋夫人親自宜識了「孟姜女。」她認爲這戲是足以傅播中圃义化的，所以慷慨地支持了它．——現在，在蒋大人的養育之下，這初生的婴孩，只要再作三個月的訓練，便将開步走了。</p>
<p>他們的目的地是紐約。現在他們已經開始和，Melropolier　Musie　Bearau接洽中（這是美團音樂界規模最大的組織，專門代爲租　戲院，　前梅團芳博士留美時，亦由其代爲接洽院予）。假如演出成績良好，買　踴躍，他們希望能劃各處走走，最理想的是適遊全歐洲。</p>
<p>關於他們的護照，據楊小姐锐：是絕無問题的，因爲有總經理鄧士萍先生的帮忙，（蒋夫人委任的）楊小姐對記者說：「鄧先生給我们的帮助是非常大的，他是器經理，但是他也是音樂家，平日爲人和露可親，常常說笑括……」</p>
<p>王淵參加聯繫舞蹈</p>
<p>正在說起籌經理的時候，鄭先生走來了。他的確是個健談的人，在楊小姐介紹後，他說：「上海人真是造講專家，常常喜歡把好好的事情說得據一點。中華音樂劇團明明是個多麼光榮的組織，有積極燦爛的龍　，但是偏偏有人要說它是騙局，說是把小孩子，女人·騙到美國去賣掉」？接着他又指着正在練舞的王淵偷偷地告訴我說：「王淵的中國舞蹈是最有根基的，但是報紙上偏要宣傳她是草裙舞專家！」</p>
<p>接着鄭先生訪問他對該團的前途抱有最大的樂觀，他曾經在美國住過很長的時期，他知道美國人喜歡的是什麼。像這樣經過鄭重籌備，實力雄厚的團體，是祇有成功，沒有失敗的。</p>
<p>正在這時候，警報拉起來了，「五行星」的排練可以告一個段落。記者趕緊拉住了阿父夏洛穆夫先生，作了一度簡短的談話。知道阿父夏洛穆夫今年正好五十歲，三十年前，他便離開了祖國－蘇聯。到中國來研究中國的古樂。他熟悉中國的風土人情，喜歡吃中國飯，他說他還願意人中國籍，這次旅美後，還是要回中國來，因爲他要繼續這個工作，他把這個工作當作他的終身事業。</p>
<h3 id="c69">救濟蘇北難胞　王進珊畫展　今日起公開展覽七天 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>王進珊瑚教授救濟蘇北難民畫展，昨日下午在南通學院，舉行預展。記者事先接到了柬請，抱着「先觀爲快」的悄耗，由王教授伴導蒲，在事塲裘，足足</p>
<p>觀察了一小時：</p>
<p>王教授的贪事，承襲了唐宋元間正統派的筆法。徒他的畫裏，可似表现出，他是一個多方面的藝術家，他的畫包括了山水，人物，翎毛，花卉。此中尤以人物類中的佛像，更是他全都作品中的精髓！</p>
<p>料進畫塲的右角，五十號一幅素衣袒胸的美髯公乎把夏扇一栖，態度安一样開逸着老的臉土，堆满了笑容－遗是勝利的笑客—王教授說：去年掠戰捷音初播，他</p>
<p>想起了杜甫的詩句：，白日放歌须縱酒，青春結伴好還螂。」困顿了入年的心境，不禁怒放於一朝，於是完成了這幅精瀾作品。</p>
<p>記者又接運欣賞了許多「羅漢」的人像作品，覺得一幅有一幅的表情和風格。看到八十八號「達廳尊者」一瘭巨幅的人像責時，但見畫而笨法，是力的表现。設色秀逸，一襲朱衣，徽托着達摩健壯的軀體，令人有氣象萬千之感·可是，贴鄰的一幅「白荷，」白花　　，却又給人以清焦恬淡之感！</p>
<p>六十六掀「蘆雁」一幅，是四幅屏條拼湊而成。畫面土的雁羣，一隻有一隻雁的委態。兩抹蔗葉和蔗捍的筆調，顯得強勁而有力！看了這幅畫俊，好像处在暮秋肅殺的悄景下，往凄寂的蘆岸漫步一番！</p>
<p>胳放十三號一大辐「流離失所圖，」展现在記者的眼前。畫面上點綴善三兩個古装而老弱的難民，携老扶幼，手持拐杖，背着包袱，榜徨摸索。遠處却隱陸地顯出了古城牆的一角。可是，難民们却是茫茫一前途，找不到一個歸宿！王教授在畫面上題着：「三十五年五月東歸，蘇北地方不寗，難胞流雕失所，余亦無家可歸，寫此圖以寄慨。」這幅畫充份象微着當前蘇北的慘景。雖然標價二百萬元，侧信有心人都會不惜斥资爭購的。</p>
<p>此外二十五號的一幅「小島，」四十五號的一幅「農村風味，」雖出以累摘淡寫的笨調，却給人以雋永的意味。六十一號「普賢尊者」一幅，是募唐哭一退十的筆法。二十號「衆聲松彭」一幅，蒼松白梅，相映，成趣、都是不可多得的作品。</p>
<p>記者踏地畫室時，外面正值火拿寫張，雖免不揮不揮汗如雨。可是，變限經過一小時冰洪淋的汾　後，適才的熱浪，不知不覺地，已消城於無形。</p>
<p>王教授是一位多方面的藝術家，他執激中央政治學校，已歴五年。譚餘時，除執筆作畫外，還寫過「晚香玉」，「柳瞪化明」，「雙騐樓」，漁樵　讀」，「日月争光」等等劇术　此外，還担任過導演，寫過「山唐小品，」主编過「文藝月刋，」「文藝先锋」等刋物．现在的畫展，不過是他多才多藝表现的一面。</p>
<p>王教授的畫從今大起，到七日止，每日上午十時至下午六時，假重慶北路威海衛路南通學院，公開展覽。昨火預展時，記者發现精品多幅，已有人定購，但願關心蘇北難胞和藝事的各界都去欣掌一番！（蒼龍）</p>

<p>關於立法院正在審議中這財政部修正銀行法草案·曾引起金融界深切矚目，記者爲明暸內容起見，特定訪銀行學會秘書長朱斯煌，承告主要各點如下：（一）該該草案第三條所載，如股份有限公司組織之銀行，其資本至少需二百萬元，據稱此種款額，係依幣制穩定後之標準。果然，現時則無所適從，立法應予現實化，資本額一點，頗使人民不易明暸。（二）存款準備金一節，朱氏認爲依照草案規定，活存可高至百分之二十，定存可高至百分之十五，須繳存於中央銀行。按此比例，如係真正流動性之準備，尙無問題，奈所謂準備者，實際上乃呆滯之保證。此外，銀行本身，尙需保持相當現款及交換頭寸，須在百分之四十左右，而銀行可以運用之存款，不過百分之三四十左右，銀行頭寸，焉能靈活。（三）對於業務上之限制，似太嚴格，例如工礦業之放款，限定不得少於百分之二十，否則即須受罰。就此一點，中銀行有大宗存款在手，一時未逢工礦放款對象，又如遇有大宗工礦收回時，豈非視同一律。（四）更如限制銀行爲其他公司股東，及允許銀行買賣有價證券，事實上未免矛盾。（五）不支產抵押放款，不得超過銀行實收資本公積金百分之十，爲數雖屬其微，但現在工廠通融資金，多數仰仗廠房廠基爲抵押品。此種規定，原則上雖屬合理，然究與我國工商業環境優勝劣汰能　合。（六）銀行有限責任，股東加位責任之規定，不但事實上不可能，而且對於保障存戶之目的，亦無濟於事。朱氏末稱：外國銀行之規定，雖爲舊銀行法所未有，此項規定，當然適合環境，但外國銀行業務範圍，如存款，貼現，國際滙兌，應有盡有，惜對於我國銀行業務，諸多障碍。</p>

<p>（本報訊）近來常因食糖問題，涉及台灣糖業公司，外界對於該公司之運銷組織供應等情報，頗多不明者，記者昨特走訪該公司協理兼業務處經理宋以信，承詳告一切，據稱台糖公司耐於本年五月一日正式成立，由行政院及台灣長官公園合辦，外傅官商合辦等情不確，其接收經過耐於去年十月間，經濟部資源委員會接收台灣糖廠四十二家，日人組織之公司四家，期中包括存糖直五萬噸及期他農塲等，後資源會　屬行政院，故台灣糖廠等亦改歸政院接管，經政院與台灣長官公團決議，由兩機構合組公司，</p>
<p>宋氏對於糖價高漲，稱因運輪困難，蓋來往船隻雖有，却不能大量供運台糖，但所以不能運輸，乃政府另有措置，公司方面不便追究，實際上公司存貸不多，估計上海目前需糖每月約一萬噸，（其中百分之七十爲運銷外埠者）以後如交通暢達，需要恐將大量超出，</p>
<p>到台灣產糖情形，據宋氏告稱，在日人時期，台灣農民被強迫種甘蔗，每年可產糖一百四十萬噸，而目前情形則大不想同，農民大都因種米獲利較大而棄甘蔗，蓋甘蔗自耕種至收成時期，需時十八個月，自接收至本年四月，共產糖九萬噸，公司當局計劃將來每年產糖三十萬噸至五十萬噸，但需在二三年之後，始能實現，現四十二廠工人僅一萬二千人，職員千餘人，</p>
<p>該公司總經理沈鎮南，前赴台任務即在鼓勵農民種植甘蔗，視察廠務及四公司業務等事，不日即將返滬，將商計決定發展糖業計劃，以後如運輸工具交通問題解決，擬在天津漢口及廣東設分公司同，現台北，辦事處業已成立，該公司資本目前尚未統計，經費暫由中央及台灣銀行透支云，</p>

<h3 id="c107">火柴原料與電化工業 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 章柏菴</p>
<p>火柴之主要原料爲「氣酸鉀」與「赤燐」，而「氣酸鉀」與「赤燐」，之製造，皆須電解，故火柴原料與電化工業，兩者是不可分離的。</p>
<p>戰前我國火柴原料，皆用外貸，如英貸之白藥（即氣酸鉀）德貸之億利頓「赤燐」者是，抗戰初期，各火柴廠競進原料，以致當時火柴原料與顏料，咸成爲紅極一時的商品。逮後歐戰軍與，來源斷絕，內地火柴，不特爲商人之投機目標，其至有時候各處都斷貸，至今內地還是用着紙煤頭的習慣，就　這個關係。</p>
<p>當三十年的時候，內地電化廠紛紛設立，先有東南化工廠產製白藥，繼有　州某大電化工廠火大量製造，及閩省南平等處，亦紛紛產造，後又有製燐工廠之出現，不過規模甚小，不及氣酸鉀之普遍而多。</p>
<p>氣酸鉀（Ｋ+CI）之工程，凍若何繁複，但在戰時特料極度缺乏之下，加以工作經騐，沒有充實，初期所遇的困難，似乎是無可避免的，永嘉東南化工廠，用60K.Q.之DC電解食　，目的是正副產並重，初以胆僧脫氏電泌行電解，所得氯氣甚少，該電池之炭精條，粗而少，正與滬天原電化廠初期行電解作業得到時同樣的缺點，繼用蜂巢式之陽極碳棒，於是氯氣產出量增大。　州電化廠之作業，不甚明暸，而閩省之電解食廳，頗有別出心裁者，南平福建企業公司之電化廠，用18KW.之DC電機，以利用金魚玻璃缸爲電池，全總電流供給二百餘只金魚缸電解池，每月出產氯酸鉀十八回（每回統計百市斤），他的作業程序是這樣的：</p>
<p>先將桐碱鉀液與食監混和，置於開口之電解池內，進行電解，以學理來說，食監及鉀與水經電解後，是生成了次氣酸鉀，此時炭酸鈉，次氯酸釧經赤氧化後，成氯酸鉀，炭酸欠亦可作工業原料出售，如果變作燒碱只要用石灰共煮就得。此爲工业上一种简单而效率高超之操作方法。</p>
<p>还有以桐碱与食監　合，用大水缸，作電化池者，亦甚巧妙，食監上和入水後，放於缸中，用220W之AC電流通於缸與缸間之連環銅圖，經過四小時之電解，其液體燒堿，即已生成，可直接供製皂之用，還有百分之二十之氯化鉀，再經電解，即可作成氯酸鉀。</p>
<p>是爲內地氯代鈉之製造，本來亦可用電化來解決，但是內地設有大都市那歴大的電力，普通可憐得很，那有餘力來供給工業用電呢？所以內地燐廠，製燐方法，係　酸來公解的。</p>
<p>取獸骨隔氧乾　之，生成骨炭粉，骨經監酸之分解，成爲燐酸鈣再經木炭還原，蒸留之即得紅燐，重行蒸留，即得「赤燐」。</p>
<p>我國瀕海監區，不一而足，今後電化氯中國，勢在必行媽產地之監，電解之，則火柴原料，可毋須仰給於人。而獸骨又爲廢特之一，若用以造磷，則利用價值甚大焉。</p>

<h3 id="c108">太平宰相的憂鬱 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>本報十日紐約航訊</p>
<p>民主黨政府在美國，已經連接執政十四年，最初五年，可以稱之為羅斯福的「經濟中興時期」，那時候，全世界經濟不景氣，美國的資木主義，幾乎頻於總崩潰，許多美國朋友，到現在講起一九二九年的經濟恐慌，仍然有一點「談虎色變』，據說，那時候，華爾街的銀行關了門，紐約百老匯路上，儘是『要飯」的人。許多人沒有地方　飯，沒有房子睡覺，晚上就黏在地下車中不走，地下火車。從這頭開到那頭，又從那頭開回這頭，許多人就在那裏邊打盹過夜。冬天，地下火車有暖氣設備，比做「冷風刮面』的馬路巡閱使，要舒適得多。</p>
<h3 id="c109">工人驕懶　係由戰爭養成 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>我聽一位在紐約的中國老留學生，談一九二九年的故事，他說：「那個時候，我們當留學生才有意思。雖然我們那時並不富，但在那些失了業的工人看起來，我們的生活，便是他們夢想中的天堂，那時候，我可以化最低的工資，雇工人替我打掃房子。後來，我雇到一個根木不要工資的聽差，他的條件；就祗要在我的門外，晚上允許他捲一條毛毯睡覺。」</p>
<p>他說：那時候有一名替他送飯的美國工人，也不要工資，每晚上，必來取一個　幣（五分錢），他拿了這五分錢，便攢進地下火車，這樣，他便可以「打發」走一夜。</p>
<p>可是，時代變了，如今的美國工人，不但不再希罕這五分錢，而且連正常的工作，都想不幹。層出不窮的罷工案件，固然由於局部的經濟失調，但是，戰爭養壞了他們的驕懶之氣。剩餘的薪餉，還够他們有相當時期作放蕩不拘的生活。</p>
<p>在紐約，現在最困難的事，是找房子，許多退伍軍人回來，原先都是鋼鐵廠，水泥廠的工人，當兵打了幾年仗回來，他想在紐約當寓公了。很多G·Ｉ·現在都紐約成了家，這樣，房荒問題自然越來越嚴重，而工廠的生產力，更不能得到平衡了。</p>
<h3 id="c110">萬不得已　政府施用壓力 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>本來，根據美國政治思想的最高原則，是政府的權力，愈小愈好，政府管的事，愈少愈好。在美國，「國營企業」這名辭，是很少聽到的，任何工商企業，都是民營。但是，到民營的企業，發生問題，或者影響到國家大計的時候，政府有責任出來彌補和接管。譬如：羅斯福總統在世的時候，因為遭逢到戰爭，許多汽車工廠改製飛機，許多輕重工業改成軍需軍火工業，有的，由政府補貼，使生產加多，有的，由政府全部接管。但是，一到戰爭結束，國會便通過了所謂『工業歸還法案」，仍然交還給私人企業家。杜魯門總統對於處理工潮的原則，仍然取「政府權限愈少愈好」的原則，一直到萬不得已，才下令由政府暫時接管。杜魯門下令接管鐵路的那天，因為他匆匆要去密蘇里威廉學院接受名譽博士的學位，要求工人延緩五天，再行罷工，並且暗示給司機工人領袖威特男，可以接受工人方面的條件。這樣，把當時一觸即發的工潮，緩和了一下。但是，等到杜魯門總統，帶着博士方帽子，回到白宮以後，並沒有履行。他的『暗示』，因此，威特男駡他為「最無恥的騙子」。</p>
<p>時代週刋描寫白宮談話的內幕，非常輕鬆。它說：當杜魯門從密蘇里州回華府的第一天，便召見路員工人的領袖瓊斯頓和司機工人的領袖威特男。杜魯門總統，首先講了一大篇，很謙和，很客氣的話，瓊斯頓總是：「是的，總統」「是的，總統」。但是，這位威特男先生，根本毫無表情，兩眼看天花板，臉皮斜向，一副滿不在乎，而包含輕視的神情。週刋的記者註解著說：威特男祗有受過兩年小學敎育，他是鐵路工人中十足的『行伍出身』。</p>
<h3 id="c111">總統辦事　態度鎮靜客觀 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>杜魯門在美國政治上，有過幾十年國會的經騐，他的涵養，他的正直、誠如紐約日報記者描寫的一個典型的美國新派紳士，他處理許多紛亂的公事，總是以鎭靜，客觀的方式，一點不急躁，不凌亂但是，無論如何，他總是生就一個「太平宰相」的典型，不能像羅斯福那樣『雄才大略』，羅斯福做事，有時候可以用迅雷不及掩耳的手段，像一九三四年勒令華爾街的銀行，停止營業。有時候，可以非常迂迥曲折，使人家心悅誠服，羅斯福和孤立派的鬥爭，就是這樣，其次，控制民主黨內部的能力，羅斯福較杜魯門强得多，最近杜魯門的「遏止罷工法案」，就是一個例子。</p>
<p>「遏止罷工法案」是杜魯門總統向國會提出的，那是在鐵路工潮平復以後，煤艦工潮沒有解決以前的事。據杜魯門自己說：因為他看到工人這樣瘋狂的罷工，會妨害美國的社會福利，損害到美國的經濟命脈。因此他在修改勞工法之餘，平行地提山這『遏止罷工法案』。內容說：「凡是業經政府宣佈接管的企業，工人不得無理要挾罷工，否則，政府可强迫罷工工人，徵服軍役」。</p>
<p>這一個法案公佈討論以後的第二天，我注意華盛頓和紐約的輿論，一大半都予以嚴厲的攻擊，左傾的紐約『下午報』，盡一幅巨大的漫畫，說杜魯門是法西斯軍閥的化身。他的社論說：杜魯門的法案，將絞殺美國勞工的生命，無異與全國勞工為敵，紐約時報和論壇報，也都說總統的法案，言之之過火，祗有一張被目為黃色新聞，而實際態度右傾，宣傳技巧非常涵蓄的「紐約日報」，寫了一篇社評，叫做『哈當，幹下去！』（按：哈雷是杜魯門總統的小名。）</p>
<h3 id="c112">眼明手快　還要運用魄力 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>遏止罷工法案表決以後第二天，杜魯門總統在白宮舉行記者招待會，有人談到這件事，總統的表示，非常誠懇，他從美國的民主根底說起，再說到個人自由與社會福利的不能兩全。他說：『我是一個美國的行政首長，我應該選那一途呢？當然是社會福利更重要』。因此，「我決心繼續與漫無限制的個人自由作殊死戰」。</p>
<p>有些美國人背後識嘲他說：「那兒是社會福利？還是替資本家謀福利罷了」！</p>
<p>這是一種看法，另有一種說法，我以為倒是很獨到的。那是一位國會的職員對我說的！「總統決不會這樣　，提出那種必不能通過的緊急法案，總統之所以這樣做，完全是一種對罷工工人的威嚇，表示到萬不得已時，他也有法寳」。</p>
<p>那時候，煤礦工潮還在克盧格（內政部長兼政府接管煤礦督辦）和路易士談商之中，法案鬧過以後不久，工潮就解決了。我聯想起鐵路工潮之所以能解決，完全靠的軍隊開車那一下威脅。記得在倫敦的時候，有人對我說：且莫看杜魯門那副庸碌的相貌，他用原子彈炸日本，用停止『租借法案』炸英國「他才不庸碌呢？』</p>
<p>任何一個政治家，特別是一個大國的行政首領，多多少少要運用一點「魄力」，有魄力的人，必定是『眼明手辣』。手不辣，眼不明，不能常行政首長，所以，詩人李後主，當了皇帝要亡國，風流英皇愛德華八世，寗願遜位當溫莎公爵。學者總統威爾遜，要嘔血而死。</p>

<p>對於今天這樣的美國經濟失調，問題不在於杜魯門總統的能力和手段，而在於美國的經濟制度，會不會有所更張？</p>
<p>民主黨的左派是主張「國家社會主義」的，　萊士就是這樣看法，他認為今天美國對內對外的問題，都沒有把握住這一個大政。如果讓資本主義繼續存在，則對內的經濟危機，不能謀得治本的解決，對蘇聯的外交，必然愈走愈遠。但是，我從來沒有看見或聽見，關於華萊士的「國家社會主義」的具體主張及其實施方法。</p>
<p>紐約下午報，曾經連續登載過好幾篇關於工潮解決的專論，他主張：欲謀澈底解決工潮的起伏，不要由政府接管，應該由政府全部收買。『下午報』主張趁資方無意繼續經營的時候，作國家一勞永遠的打算，首先收買煤礦，乃至於鐵路。</p>
<h3 id="c114">工會動靜　影響總統競選 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>在中國講國營煤礦或國營鐵路，似乎並不生疏，在美國，這樣的論調，確實感到「刺耳」，很多美國人認為企業國營，一定會將企業本身毀滅，同時國營將增加政府的權力，使憲政常軌和個人自由破壞。有位美國鐵路工會的負責人吿訴我：工會組織，可以補救私人企業的　點，因為工會一健張，可以使　方的無限制尋求利潤的心理，受到平衡和限制，他分拆許多平衡的道理，這道理，很像中國盛倡的「合作制度」。</p>
<p>他舉這次領導罷工的鐵路司機工人和路員的職工聯合會為例。他們的聯合會，創始於十九世紀。當一八七七年時，美國還在資本主義的初期，有一次鐵路工人大罷工，這些「亡命之徒」的工人，縱火燒毀了鋼鐵之城匹茨堡的軍站，工潮平息以後，才把工會健强起來。到現在七十年，工會包括的會員，遍及全國鐵路工人，工會的基金和財產，要用「億」字單位來計算。工會的一動一靜，可以影響每一届總統的選舉，工會甚至可以撥出一部份費用，為某黨某人作競選活動費，他說：『資本家雖然有錢，工會也有錢，』他說：「美國的工人和資本家是平等的，彼此都無所畏懼」或聽了他的話，再想想威特男的一篇「討杜誓詞」：不禁構起了一幅一九四八年競選的遠景。</p>

<p>本報廿日洛陽通訊</p>
<p>熱天走路，是最痛苦的一件事，尤其在樹木稀少遍地荒凉的北方，簡直沒有辦法使你解脫熱的桎梏。</p>
<p>記者為了觀光黃汎區美式曳引機的農場耕作，特別由洛陽來到開封，路上雖然只有四百多里，也在火車上坐了一天有半，途中幸虧沒有掉道，沒有候車，準時到達，可算是難得的一回事。但路上的苦楚，還是要你自已一分一刻的熬過十幾個鐘頭的，也許是其他棧上想像不到的吧，京滬綫上則絕對沒有、</p>

<p>首先記一下候車的困難，每天東行的特快車是早晨八時開車，七時售三等客票，售票要依次列成長蛇大陣，分成軍民二大列，因為客人過多，往往天還未亮，票房前就把買票陣擺起了，惟恐自己買不到手，坐不上車，或者被加倍的罰補全程票，最怕的是在車站上再等一天，旅館裏再住上一兩夜，那心中不安的滋味。走過長途的人，是會嘗到的。</p>
<p>購到票後，即可自由登車，自　坐位，三等車是沒有人負責管理的，是過去的悶子貨車，加了幾條帶靠背的長櫈，除了兩個大門調換流動而外，沒有什麽氣孔和窗子來調節室內的空氣，其零亂擁擠的情形，可以想像得到。</p>
<p>頭二等車是先一日下午買票的，每次都有一定坐位，對號入座，有時因為車輛調配關係，售票與坐位，亦大有出入這樣也免不了一車紊亂，弱肉強食，買到票者往往變成一二等車的站客了。</p>

<p>本報　州廿二日航訊</p>
<p>蔣主席近電令陝甘兩省特別加強查禁烟毒，烟犯仍交軍法機關依照禁烟禁毒治罪條例辦理，期限為一年。</p>
<p>甘省五年建設計劃中之第一期中心工作，共分四項：（一）樹立建國風尙，（二）奠定經建基礎，（三）積極掃除文盲，（四）促進地方自治。業經省府委會通過施行。</p>
<p>省府為杜絕放振流弊，特派社會處長楊集瀛前往定西臨洮等十二縣監放旱災振款，楊氏已於十七日出發。</p>
<p>省府前向中央請求外匯美金三十萬元，辦理蘭州市自來水工程，行政院業經令示到省，飭將該項工程計劃呈核後，即予匯撥。</p>
<p>嘉峪關外安西玉門兩縣歷年多早，時因分水而起糾紛，省府爲根除該兩縣水利　紛，決定興修昌馬大壩，（安玉兩縣四六分水）已飭水利林牧公司派員勘測。此項工程完成後，共可灌田七萬二千九百畝。</p>
<p>甘省報紙暨其他印刷紙來源，抗戰期內純由川陝運來，成本甚高。鄂人朱尊誼氏鑒於造紙工業在西北方面之重要，特由川來蘭，創設隴元造紙廠，籌備迄今，已歷三載有餘，現已決定於八九月間開工。該廠完全以機器生產，開工後日可出紙二噸，包括報紙及其印刷紙張，除供甘肅全省各報社公私機關應用外，並可供給寗靑新等省。</p>

<p>有一次火車途中出了軌，路基損壞，一天沒有車，一天在幾次的貼換着佈告：內容都不外幾時車到幾時準開的字樣，但事實的表現，是幾時準不到，火車老在遙遠的路上。沒有到來的消息，結果騙得站上客人越等越多，整整等了一天，從早晨五時到晚上九時，沒有離開站台，疲乏不敢休息，飲食不敢離座，又得廢盡全身血肉，來抵抗暴日的酷熱曝晒，客人餓得熱得乏得要命，叫苦連天，還是一個失望，車頭路上壞了，還得等到派車頭去接，才有辦法，於是乘客才鬆了一口氣，有的病了，有的回了有的了！有的哭了，有的……了睡這時的站臺，正像是一個病人狂人和乞丐的養成所。</p>
<h3 id="c119">清新境界　吸取濃郁香息 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>記者　　沒有到這樣苦苦等候的遭遇，買票也沒有加入陣綫去擠。剛到車站就上車，上去了車就開車，不過是上了頭等的站車，只許有站的位置，不許有行動的自由，坐位更是有點夢想，這次是不對號的一次最擁擠的車，擠得滿車是人，滿車亂呌，車子不顧一切的開出了。</p>
<p>太陽正從東南方射進來，晒得窗邊的人臉色都變紅了，車子不住的喀喀咚咚向前拖進着，漸漸走上有綠蔭護道樹的老道，乘客伸出頭來，和洋槐樹們逗着玩，送舊迎新的一棵棵的撫摸了一番，呼吸着樹叢中葉香的空氣，心裏感到有點濃郁，不是頂上一陣黑烟掠過樹空，幾乎忘記是在車中。</p>
<h3 id="c120">農田赤黃　正待天雨播種 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>再向前走，遇到了一個趕牛回家的農夫，車上人就和他攀談起來，農村經濟，農村副業，農民生活，農田收成等談了二十多分鐘，後來遇到岔路那農夫吿辭去後，大家才感到自己是坐在一日千里的火車上，不禁相視驚笑！遠望着一塊塊赤黃色的農田，正待着天雨種播呢！</p>
<p>這次車路上沒有停，大站小站沒有停過三十分鐘，可算是鄭洛段上的特別快車！正因如此，很多人餓得沒有飯吃，渴得沒有水喝，往往車子剛停，沒有下車或下車剛端起碗，喇叭一鳴就開了，一直到鄭州，很多人肚子是空的，很多人僅隨便塞進去一點開水，黃瓜，饅頭，花生之類。</p>
<h3 id="c121">汜水滎陽　經歷一段險程 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>汜水到滎陽是窄軌，是一段最險的途程，車子開得很慢，一次下坡又上坡，馬力就開不上去，結果停車再燒磅，乘客以為出了事，車箱內熱悶得焦人·急得發火，看見那道旁溝裏的翻倒車箱，是幾天前的事，死了十餘人，傷了三十餘人，壞了鐵軌數條，車箱下不知道是否還有遺魂！很多人都在驚吿着。</p>
<p>汜水特產杮餅柿霜，是個柿　站。滎陽特產草帽辮，草帽草袋很多，是個草辮站，車到左右前後都在呌，很多人以此為生，每年產量很大，可情品質技術包裝宜傳都沒有進步，不久是會破產倒閉的，</p>
<p>四點鐘到鄭州，這段火車已到頭，不論南行漢口，北上安陽，東去開封或上海，到鄭州都非換車不可。換車的原因是車子太少不够分配。</p>
<p>這樣，鄭州成了宿站，商業轉運，就特別發達。出了車站，兩邊排滿了賣茶的推車的，亂喊　叫的兜　生意，人們在亂擠中，分散到各街坊去。</p>
<h3 id="c122">深夜趕車　極端緊張不安 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>次晨六時，有鄭徐段特快車，五時賣票，放客深夜三四點鐘就要到站準備，其緊張不安情形可以想見，這次快車雖平，坐的人却特別擁擠，因為早上沒有太陽，是理想的旅行天氣。</p>
<p>這次車上頭等車只有一節，二等車比三等車還多，所以二等乘客也最多，我五時五十分起床，趕快到站，各等車內已裝得滿滿的，站上堆滿着行李，車門口坐站着很多乘客，頭二等車仍然不對號的，我就從較稀的地方上去，但仍然勉强當一名站門口的票客，站得比洛陽來時尤擁擠，所以日頭未出，呼吸的悶人，平已汗流浹背了，人們都是空着肚子趕車的，坐上之後不免心內發慌，幾乎不能支持，站的人慢慢都想法跨下，不論左右和下面是什麽東西！我坐在靠茶火爐的門口邊，下面鞋底放在水中，身子一面向火一面靠着滿面泥點的門，因為這個又熱又　的門口，還沒有被人佔據，坐是自己設法，只要不受過路人的影響，是可以安定下去的。</p>
<h3 id="c123">天之驕子　熱天喝得茶水 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>剛到車上，車便開了。臂上帶藍布條的車上小營開始對乘客賣茶，忙着送水送壺收錢等的工作，，一直到中牟，他們收回了茶壼和水錢，點騐一下，茶壺少了二十幾把，茶杯少了二十多個，他們費了很大力量找不出來，所以中牟以東，他們的賣茶生意停止了，他們說：車上人太多，賣不成茶，送茶水時滴在誰的顯上即要打駡，送不到水時吃茶的又不願意，把茶壼都丟在車外去了，一隻壞得粗得只値四五百元一把的壺，路局要我們照一二千元一把來賠，賣的茶錢不够賠壺，還賣什慶的！不管乘客多麽渴得需要，到開封的這一段，再也不送水了，只有守在茶爐邊子的人，可以自由的喝，我總算有喝水的大福，熱天有水喝，　算得是天之驕子了。</p>
<h3 id="c124">跨過黃河　車行加快速度 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>鄭州以東的田野，已經長起尺把高德禾苗，這已見到豫中的氣候和豫西已不相同，農夫們睡在大樹蔭下乘凉，十二散歲的小孩子，赤裸裸不掛一絲的站在村旁。過中年橋，窗口的坐客都伸頭到外面去觀光，那是日本兵和我們的工人建築的臨時木橋，很堅實，人人都在稱讚，只是對橋下滔滔的黃流，感到不太偉大驚人，水不大了，浪也小了曲　流來轉去了，的確沒有在潼關西關憑視時那樣雄壯！澎湃！</p>
<p>黃河跨過，進了夷路，車行速度加快，人們在飢餓與熱浪的高壓下，希望着早到開封，一站一站的停了兩三次，十一時十分出了開封車站，就坐車進人開封城了！</p>

<h3 id="c125">編者的話 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>戰後各國的政治，均已步入民主和平的新時代；戰後中國的政治，無疑的，也將踏上民主化的大道。但是民主政治的演進，自有其過程與法則，決非一朝一夕即能達於理想之境。翻閱民主先進各國的政治史，就可知道今日各國的政治，都是自然發展的結果。</p>
<p>民主政治的骨幹是法治精神。我國一部政治哲學史，雖然很早就充滿了民主思想，但是傳統觀念，重禮治而輕法治，似亦無庸諱言。故法治的精神，至今還需要提捐與培養。而一切法治，尤須從下級地方做起。</p>
<p>國父孫中山先生早說過：中華民國之基礎在於地方自治，而縣為自治單位，更明白規定於建國大綱。故今日中國，欲實行民主政治，非先切實推行地方自治不可。民主國家的政治，莫不有其基層糾織，地方自治就是慕層的政治組織。中山先生的民權主義，就是要運用這種基層組織，由人民在各地方行使選舉，罷免，　制，複決，四權，藉以充分表現民意。蔣主席所提倡的新縣制，其主要精神也在「加强地方組織，促進自治事業，以奠定革命建國的基礎。」可見我們國家如果眞要由官治，轉變而為民治，必須先把地方的基層組織完全讓人民自治，然後由下而上，民治精神始可發皇。</p>
<p>自抗戰勝利結束以來，已閱十月，早應該踏上建國復興的大道。所惜國家火局，還是沒有安定，一切未能全上正軌，殊難令人滿意。但是人民心目中的所謂「好政府」，說來也非常簡單，第一要廉潔，第二要有效率，第三要能為人民認眞辦事，如此而已。這個理想怎樣才能實現？唯有從地方自治着手，健全政治的基層組織，一切地方問題讓人民舉出可以信託的人來負責辦理，不再借手於官治。與其空唱民主，不如脚踏實地的努力於地方自治。</p>
<p>本報為協助民政設施促進地方自治起見，自本日起，增闢「民政簡訊」專擱。一方面喚起人民，大家注意衆人的事，逐漸養成民主政治的風氣與習慣，不放棄人民對於地方政治應負的責任；另一方面則在喚起政府重視人民自治，改變他們以往只知官治的心理。我國有句老話：「為政不在多言」。我們希望在這實施憲政的前夕，地方當局必須用事實來表現天天在推進人民的自治，使各縣巿在儘早的可能期間，成為完全自治之縣巿。</p>

<p>問：新從外縣搬到本巿來居住的戶口，如何申請登記？</p>
<p>答：新遷入本巿居住的戶或口，如有久住之意思的，可向新遷入居住地之保長或區公所，索取設籍登記申請書，申請設籍登記。如沒有久住之意思，祗要向保長報請登記為流動人口。</p>
<p>問：何以不報遷入登記呢？</p>
<p>答：依照修正戶籍法第二十八條規定：「由他戶篇管轄區域遷入在一個月以上，不變更所屬之籍者，應為遷入登記。」依此條規定，遷入登記有三個條件：一，是必須由「他戶籍管轄區」遷入；二，是須注滿一個月以上；三；是不變更原有屬籍。新　大之戶口，在本市無久住之意思，常然不願變更其原來屬籍，所以不能申請設籍，但是又未住滿一個月以上，不合遷入登記的條件，所以只能為流動人口之登記。</p>
<p>問：「何謂流動人口之登記？</p>
<p>答：所謂流動人口之登記，依照新戶籍法第廿九條之規定：「遷出原戶籍管轄區，不滿一個月不變更所屬之籍者，應為流動人口之登記。」但已住滿一個月，已合於遷入登記之條件，可重行辦理選入登記。向就地區公所或保辦公處索取　入登記申請書，逐項塡寫淸楚，交由保辦公處轉送區公所登記。</p>
<p>問：什麽叫做戶籍管轄區域？</p>
<p>答：所謂戶籍管轄區域，依新戶籍法第六條之規定為：「戶籍登記以鄕鎭為管轄區域，以鄕鎭長兼住戶籍主任……」至院轄市及省轄市，又　規定分別適用省及縣之規定，所以木巿以區為管轄區域，以區長兼住戶籍主任。</p>
<p>問：全戶選入的由何人去申請登記？個人選入怎樣申請？，遷徙登記（包括選入遷出及流動人口，）以本人或家長為申請義務人，所以全戶遷入的，由家長申請，個人的遷入，由本人自己申請。</p>

<p>心震撼得厲害，——當他在遙遠的沙漠的時候，他會幻想起家，孤獨的母親，但是，他會寗靜地支配自己的情感。現在，他的脚又已發觸到那塊他熟悉的土地上了，他　得，一小時以後，他的幻想中的人物又都一一相見了。但是，他却又忐忑不安了起來。</p>
<p>機車已經停了下來，靜生隨着水流般的人羣，一手提着那隻累使的提箱，也擠下降車廂。</p>
<p>在車站的廣塲上，他看見了黑壓壓的人，高　　的巨　，　亂紛紛的車輌，再仰看頭上悠悠的天，靜生看見了自己的寂寞。久別重逢，他盡力想燃　自己的熱情和與　。</p>
<p>坐上了三輪車，他更一步步的近向他的家。</p>
<p>靜生分別這熱鬧的都市，已經有整整的六個年頭。那時，他的一股熱血激動了他，使他拋棄了他的家，奔向茫茫的前　。在一個夏晚，他愉愉的上了到海防的船。等到他母親接到他的消息時。他已經在昆明的一個大學裏了。</p>
<p>他窺視街頭，仍然沒有什麼更動。高興的，　華的，人們充塞滿。他想起途中看見的各地農村間的荒飢和窮苦，真不天堂和地獄。</p>
<p>不過，天堂裏也有地獄，也有不高興的人、譬如說，靜生就是，雖然已經到了天堂，依舊懷着一顆在地獄船鉛重的心。</p>
<p>軍于已經轉科了滬西的上一條馬路上，在一條灰暗色的　堂口，他忙招呼車夫停了下來。</p>
<p>熟悉的，他我到了他的家，進了後門，拐上了黑狹的扶梯，在二層　的亭子間門口，他推了門進去。</p>
<p>母親正在用戶巨大的針縫着鞋底，滿頭灰白的頭髮，一副眼鏡，滿額的皺紋。她似乎被開門聲所震驚，抬起頭來阡去了眼鏡。</p>
<p>「媽，我來了」。他的聲音有點顫動，劃破了這靜穆的氣氛。</p>
<p>老人巍巍的站了起來，像是高興，像在回憶一幅美麗的畫景，眼眶裏似乎滿含着眼淚。</p>
<p>「靜，你嗎，——你，長高了，胖了。」</p>
<p>老人奔了過來，興密地。</p>
<p>幾年來，使靜生夢寐不安的，就是她的母親。現在使他不顧一切拋棄了他的事業回到上海來的，也是他的母親。</p>
<p>他想懺悔，他想請母親原諒他，但是，老人只是被現實激蕩得高興，好像早就忘記了過去一切的他兒子的魯莽。</p>
<p>「靜生，好了好了，我天天望你回來，——好了，我也苦出頭了」。</p>
<p>「靜生，你還沒有吃飯吧，我去，……」</p>
<p>靜生連忙安靜了她，請她坐在床沿上，不要去忙。</p>
<p>樓上的舅父也下來了。</p>
<p>靜生的離開上海其實一半也是他肌膚的　視的緣故。自從他的父親逝世家道衰落以來，他就依着母親幾乎　着舅父和施捨過日子。他的舅父是一個投機商，對於靜生母子雖然肯收留，却也總冷言熱諷的使他們難受。</p>
<p>「舅父，你好，舅母也好」靜生忙站了起來。</p>
<p>「啊，靜生，別幾年，你也長大了，——這幾年，你老娘可真苦死了，天天想你，現在可出頭了，兒子發了財回來了。」</p>
<p>「那裏那裏。」靜生　　地說。</p>
<p>「別客氣，你們回來的，那一個不發了大財，我舅父也老了，將來也要我多靠老甥呢！」</p>
<p>舅父的話又　是誠意的捧又像是尖刻的罵，他只苦笑着。</p>
<p>一陣寒暄以後，舅父上樓去了。</p>
<p>母親的話却像無盡的滔滔不絕的傾了出來，她老人家淚珠滿臉，從靜生父親的死說起，說到靜生的撫養入學赴內地，他舅父的看不起，幾年來怎樣的衆着替人家縫鞋子過日子，舅父的現在怎樣滿發着财，再说到静生既然发了财回来，就應該馬上媳婦，守了心願，另外去找一間房子，不要再受氣。</p>
<p>靜生不禁也哭了。他母親哭的是歷史的敘述，他哭的却是將來的展望。</p>
<p>他拿什麼話去安慰他的母親呢！</p>
<p>他這去了六年，四年的光陰總算是他完成了他的大學生活，其餘二年就消磨在×省的公路屬城做一個小公務員。</p>
<p>勝利的消息使學奮過，但又立即冷靜了下來。他懷念母親，但是他無法回來。</p>
<p>最後，他不顧一切，賣掉了行李，總算勉強　着這路　到時了他的家。但是，他連他今後自己的職業也沒有把握，家中所指望他的，又那裏能辦到萬分之一呢</p>
<p>他明白，他的回來·並不能溫暖他的家。</p>
<p>無數的社會的寄生蟲，戰爭中吮吸別人的血，戰後依然在那裏享福；他，一顆破碎的心，伴着他母親一顆破碎的心。</p>
<p>他知道，舅父明的了他依然是一個窮光蛋時，將怎樣的識別，他母親也一守會格外的失望。</p>
<p>歸來，他真悔歸來。</p>
<p>他真想立刻就離開這裏。他想愛這個社會，但是這社會要愛一個有財有勢的人。他知道母親深深的愛他，他却自恨沒有才力歡愉母親。</p>
<p>「媽，我這一次回來，明天就要走的。」他想起了走。</p>
<p>「什麼？」他母親一驚。</p>
<p>「是這樣的，上司的命令，要派我到台灣去接收工廠，所以明天就要走，反正，交通也方便了，我一直可以回來。」</p>
<p>他編了一個謊，母親想法瞳很相信。</p>
<p>「命令，唔，那也好，但是接收你要規矩，應該老實才好啊。」</p>
<p>靜生默默地不晤，他　重又垂了下來。</p>
<p>第二天的清晨，靜生重又抬起了提箱，到不可的前途去試探他的命運去了，</p>

<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>編者的苦悶</p>
<p>不識稿子好壞的人，根本不配當編者。編者看見好稿子，往往比自己寫了一篇好稿子還要高興。因此，編者何嘗不知道那一篇稿是正當的，不正當的，正當的與以　刋，不正當的或退或棄，然而編者有這樣的自由？沒有！</p>
<p>編者一定要顧着出版商的利益。編者不能獨自經營着想。他以爲這是正當的言論，發佈出來，一定要可以得到多數人的贊同或擁護，而老板一看，却說，這種主論很危險，一發佈出去，馬上會闖禍，要慎重，慎重！在一萬個慎重之下，你只好犧牲你的主張，不發佈出去。你以爲這是正當的創作，一發佈出去可以提高自己刋物的地位，但老板却又說，地位不是錢。不賺錢的主意少做些；蝕革有生意更絕對不可做！同時，老板却交給了你宣傳品，娛樂品，要你發佈出去。你不肯麼？沒有這個道理，除非你不相在他的統治下吃他的飯，你只好　！</p>
<p>你要發佈的，發佈不出；你不要發佈的却偏偏要發佈出去，這就是你這個編者的苦悶！你將何以打破之？打不破，於是苦悶！</p>
<p>當然你全想到自己國刋物。查是一個　關是你沒有資本。白手不能成家，你的計劃終於不能實現，你苦悶！資本即使集成了，但你又不善於經營，忙得你一天星斗而終於頭緒毫無，還是辦不成。你苦悶！辦成了，發表你所選定的稿子了，而這方面又說你不夠強硬，那方面又說你不夠刺激，另一方面更說你別有作用，受人利用，而大衆還是莫知莫覺，並不　諒你的一片苦心，實當沒有這會事。你更苦悶，大大地苦悶！你爲了生活，爲了弄慣的玩意兒，不能改就別業，還只有放棄了自創的雄心，問過頭來再向文化商人計討生活。苦悶，苦悶，一百二十個苦悶！</p>
<p>如果老板守全以宣傳爲事，並不以賺錢爲目的，那你的苦悶只是有加無已！</p>
<p>你對不起寫作者；寫作者向你責問時，你一定只有說不出的苦，說不出的悶。</p>
<p>你的苦悶的怨氣，將集中在老板，出版者的身上！</p>

<p>— 齊梵</p>
<p>——不問它是什麼，要自己所要說的話，因爲只有自己的話，才能說得親切，人感到親切。要是你是個詩人，無論你吟詠的對象是美，是醜，是上天，是人間，你必得對它要對真實的感情。你不能勉強，你不能敷衍，你不能只是爲趨時，你要無可假借地寫你自己的東西。——</p>
<p>凡是一個作者，他的作品最主要處是誠實。誠實。誠實的重要還在題材的新穎，結構的完整，文宇的流麗之上。即是作品須誠實於你者客觀所明瞭，主觀所體騐的生活。所謂誠實，並不是作者必需寶際的經描布作晨中所提到的生活，而免凡在作滿中所提到的牛活，的確都是作者在理智上所極明暸，在感悄上極能體騐得出的情素咸人性。許多人因爲自疢生活方式不新鮮，而故意選擇了一些持殊浪漫，而自己並不熟悉的生活來做題材，然後敵詐自己有限的幻想力去鋪張出自己所沒有的情感，來騙取讀者的同情。這種創造旣浪費文字來誇張虛僞的情景和傷惑，又使那些認真的波老要從文纏裹充實生活認識人生的，自然更惑到十分的不耐煩和失望。</p>
<p>生活經騐的豐富，不在生存方式的種類多與少；如做過學徒，又推過小車；走過甘肅，又走撇雲南，都在客觀的觀察力與主觀的感覺力同時的銳利敏捷，能多方面的明暸及嘗味所見，所聽、所過，種種不同的情景；不得理會到人在尖活上互相的關係與牽連；因定的與偶然的中間所起戲劇式鹹變化；最後更得有自己特殊的看法，及思想信仰與哲學</p>
<p>一個生活經騐豐嫂富者，不在容觀的見過若干事物，而在能主觀的激發很複雜不同的情感，和能雊同情於人性的許多方面的人</p>
<p>所以一個作者，在適用文字的技術學問外，必須能立在任何用活土面，能在主觀與客觀之間，感情和了解之問，理智上進退有餘，情感上橫渝奔放，記憶與幻想交錯相輔，到了真即是假，假是真的程度，他的筆下才現，騖活力真誠。他的作品才會充實偉大，不受題材與文字的影響，而能持久普遍的動人。</p>
<p>一個作者須真實地得到骸騐，這樣才能有他的同惑，同樣地作品的估價永遠是操在認真的　者手中。</p>

<p>— 中原</p>
<p>任何人，當鐵出母胎發出第一下哭聲時，一隻希奇的生之杯就執在手裹了。</p>
<p>最初楚隻極輕極輕的杯子，輕如靜空的黨絲幾乎不覺得牠的存在，漸漸地．雲絲幻化，化成一染純潔的百合花，滿盛着甜美的甘露，搖展在暖和的太陽光下，放出幽幽的香，微微的甜。－無比的快樂之液在童年的百合花杯裹洗溢－</p>
<p>可是不久，這隻美麗的杯子改變了。先是輕．風細雨，使這杯十增加了一點分量，又是薄霜飛雪，使這杯子减少了一點芳香，遂漸逐漸，牠變得光潔而明亮，逐漸逐漸，牠變成了一層脆薄的玻璃，能透過雲霧，透過雷電；能照明風雨，照明昏夜，於是不知不學地一杯甜香無比的甘露完全變味了—，快樂的童年已永遠逝去。</p>
<p>青年期的第一口苦液，並不難嘗但帶着刺激，如稀薄的黃蓮中，滴入了濃烈的酒精，使人燥熱而紛擾，渾沌而迷惑。又使人像一羣饑渴的蜂，有的在月夜，有的在花前，瘋狂地，拼命地，追尋着生的甜汁，結果，他們尋到了，可是也失望了：常他們剛在杯子的一端，注下幾滴用生命的全力去追尋的甜汁時，杯子的另一端，生的苦液無止境地泛湧而來，覆沒了一切，於是他們痛心地喊着：「生的本質竟是如此苦嗎？」－這是中年期的開始。</p>
<p>隨着歲月的飛駛逝，這杯子一天天地學生，一天天的複雜，牠沉重如一塊千斤重錘，緊壓在人們的肩頭，負之無力，扒之不去。牠複雜如一片汪洋大海，蓄藏着幻變無窮的異味幸澀酸辣的苦汁，直到銀　白髮的老年期來臨，才像烈日吸幹了海水，最後一滴生命生命之液幹了，這杯子飄然而去得到了永久的安息——死！</p>

<p>半年以後，　華每月已經拿到時一百雹錢的包銀了。她不再需要繼續學戲了，弦的玩意兒也教得沒的可教了，墨太太便歇了張弦教戲的職務，僅讓他作　華的琴師。把教　戲的報酬，便改寫了琴師報酬，麗華並想連拉胡琴也不叫張弦拉了。但是奇怪的很，麗華試騐過，別人替她拉胡琴的時候，她便口裏得不自然，甚而深深說「板」。（音樂拍子的意思。）也許是習慣了原故。可不是張弦胡琴了，却並不因此感到什麼不習慣，這是一個痛苦的矛盾　麗華從心裏討厭張弦，而意爲了「戲」，她離不開張弦！</p>
<p>一年以後，兩年以後；三年以後；麗華在這個戲園子裏的地位，由三等角昇到二等角；如今又由二等角一躍而爲一等角了；完全被張弦當初說中，果然她如今搶了石玉樓的「頭牌」。現在她和石玉樓輪流唱壓軸。在這三年裏面，她差不多已經　墨太太把投資的本錢都掙回來了。但這依然並不能滿足墨太太，離墨太太的預算還遠得很，好像麗華在爲她蓋一座金屋，而如今只不過才打了個根基而已。同時麗華自己也依然並不因她的進步感到快活，學是那麼抑鬱，那麼　默！仿佛她所有的收穫，都不是她的了，都與她漠然無關。而且這種思想，越發地跟着她的年齡成熟起來，她越發地把一切看得淡，看得空！</p>
<p>「頭牌」頂下來了，如今他確是「每况愈下」！嗓子一天不及一天，有時簡直唱不出來。有一天輪着他的諾基亞產戲「金殿裝瘋」。唱到裝瘋的時候，忽然喉嚨整個啞了，他竟一句也唱不出來！觀衆們在台下一個勁的「嗤」着，叫倒好！他在台上干着急，沒辦法。後來觀衆們嚷着要退票了，他又氣；又羞；一陣心血上湧，神經陷于錯亂，他便真的瘋了，他打台下的人；他笑；他罵；他終于放聲大哭！一時秩序大亂，大家連忙把他拉到後台，送回家去，從此，他的精神失了常態.</p>
<p>麗華目睹這幕慘劇，受了嚴重的刺激，她爲石玉樓悲哀，也爲自己悲哀！她雖然並不十分了解。爲什麼一個優令會是這樣的結局？但她直覺地感到，唱戲就是一條自生自滅的路！你唱的好，便有人捧你；唱的不好，便有人砸你　可是你能永遠唱的好嗎？不能！你會因爲病；因爲老；以及種種麗華還不會意識到的原因，而唱不好了！那時，便只有倒下來！像石玉樓似的「倒下來」！想到這裏她痛心！她惶恐！她以有只知道：只要唱，就是盡了她做人的「義務」；可是如今她更知道了：不僅唱，還要唱好；永遠地唱好；才算是盡了她做人的「義務」。但這簡直是不可能的事，石術樓便是一個例！假如她也有這麼一天－像石玉樓似的這麼一天，她將怎樣呢？墨太太又將怎樣呢；墨太太會逼她再唱；仍然唱好；長久地唱好！宛如從前帶她學戲的時候那樣逼她……天哪！她也要瘋了！現在就快瘋了！</p>

<p>農場用具，機械設備，是用以使農場工作較爲完美，經濟，容易，迅速，及作人力所不能勝作之工作。其利用之範疇，大都以其能否增進其利潤爲依據，蓋用以增進每人耕地之面積用單位資之生產量者。</p>
<p>農場設備，可分爲下列諸類：</p>
<p>（一）耕作，施肥，及下種設備</p>
<p>（二）收穫設備</p>
<p>（三）加工設備：（去殼去皮，採集，打榖，包裝，去籽，清潔，收割，磨輾等）</p>
<p>（四）動力設備；包括電力</p>
<p>（五）運輸設備</p>
<p>（六）水源控制設備</p>
<p>（七）園藝設備</p>
<p>（八）噴射設備</p>
<p>（九）牲畜及家禽設備</p>
<p>（十）農場建築</p>
<p>（十一）農不製造設備</p>
<p>（十二）家庭設備</p>
<p>（十三）其他設備</p>
<p>耕作，是非，下種三種設備，因有些工具係同施此三種功用者，故歸爲一類。水源管制設備包括各種抽水機，除土及地力保持設備。</p>
<p>每種工具或機械在生單位時間（通常爲每天十小時）所完成之工作總量，稱爲「工作率」（Rats　of　Work），而工具每一立方呎或　簡及磨榖機每匹馬力所完成之工作總量，則稱爲「工具及機械之工程率」Duty　of　Implement　and　of　machinevy），因工具之大小及樣式，完成工作之性質，土壤類別及情況，動力之，田塲中之障礙物，及農舍民田塲間之距離不同而異。</p>
<p>在美國，所用工具或機械之每呎寬度每日可工作一至三英畝（即六至十八市畝）。其較高之工作率爲每日三英畝或十公市畝，通常僅以拖申機能爲之，其較低之工作率則爲每日一英畝或低此數。</p>
<p>在美國，大部農具，均較一呎單位工作量爲多，而中國，除把外，均較一呎單位工作量爲少。中國農具外，多爲單馬式（One　horse　lype），中國南部之役畜大部爲水中，北方爲黃牛，　，程率」，截至目前，中國尙無比項記載，在「工作率」比較上，美國每人用一種農肯和一或一以上之役畜於每種作業中完成工作量均較中國每人在同種條件下所完成者爲高。在中國，同一作業之「工作率」，農具式樣不同而異。例如：一人用每次可割禾八至十行寬之中國　鐮每日可割一·開英畝或一〇·二市畝，但如用鐮刀則每日僅可割〇·四六英畝或二·八市畝。用一役畜拉曳之耕耘器所耕之面積遠較一鋤，前者每天可耕一·七英畝，或十一·四市畝，後者則僅〇·四英畝，或二·五市畝。</p>
<p>鐮與鐮刀之比較，正與耕耘器與鋤之比較相同，爲較節省勞力之農具。省力之農具，機械及設備·有工作合時及减低成本之利益，可使工作在應完成時完成之；如當土壤情形適合時，作物應種植時，雜草應剷除（尙未長大）時，及應該收穫（榖實未赤分成熟或遇不良氣候損害前）時。但省力農具有時亦有不利之點，如繳鐮刀不能割已被風吹倒之作物，中國　鐮如收穫重量作物則嫌太輕，容易浪費榖粒及弄亂榖草。</p>
<p>中國農民已盡量選用民農具以適應其環境，但加以改進，則爲可能而感急需者。</p>
<p>中國平均每一農塲有二八件設備，最少有六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇農家，主要之農肯總數約爲一·六八〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇件，每英畝農肯價值平均爲二·五元（譯者探探按：此爲衷腸前法筆價值，以後之佔計數目亦然），約等於美國每英畝農塲機械價值三分之一。</p>
<p>中國農具製造之材料，主要爲木與鐵，耕犂之犂地及犂板用鐵製，遠在美國Newbold發明鐵鑄犁的二千多年前，當美國在一五〇年前發明鐵鑄犁時，該地農民潔恐鐵能爲害土壤及有助雜草的生長而懼加使用。</p>
<p>雖然中國在若干世紀以前已有精製農具，但迄今並未作如何改進，例如：據佔計，如能用較好金屬以保持鋤邊的銳利及减低其必要之磨損程度，有鋤時即可少用勞力百分之十五至二十。（但中國一般並未注意及此。）</p>
<p>現在農具之製造大都在工人的家裏小規模鑄造同，鐵匠舖鑄造鐵的部份，木匠則作木質部分。在現代技術突飛猛進中，不論成本照舊或增高成本，應該製出效率較高之農具，雖農民所付代價較高，但其節省勞力增加生產所獲則多於所付。</p>
<p>每農塲之農具數目</p>
<p>每農塲具數止，以耕作之而積及完成耕作必需之日當選爲轉移，例如：如在小麥收獲後必須在十日內把田耕好以血插秧，如每犁每天可耕三畝，則三十畝十天可以耕好，但如農人有四十畝須種稍時：則一犁即感不敷，兩把犁又覺太多，於是農民有幾個解決辦法：可租　犁來耕此多出之十畝，但這常不易辦到，因其他農民亦在此時需要犁田，租金高漲，另一辦法爲冒着產量降低的危險在適當時間而提前或延後犁地，或屬擴大農塲面積之法，即多盤（或買）廿畝以配合發皖農具使用效率。如當地特別適於種稻，似不應自作聰明的用一部土地去種植其他作物以分配勞力。再有一法，或許即爲最好者，即用一較大犁和一較大的向畜或頭役畜，　每天能犁四畝，十天亦可耕完，在一個農塲上，各種農具，役　，人工及作物種類良好的配合，可以使農具，人工和牲畜發生最有效的使用。</p>
<p>用一種效　工具所花的費用，隨每年利用之日數而異，農具費用包括投資利息，折舊，保存，修理及使用費用（如機械用滑油，引擎用燃油）。中國一九三五年各種農具費用平均每畝作物市畝爲〇·三六五元，（或每芙畝美金〇·六〇元）總費用佔農具價值（計算時之市塲價格）之百分之四十一。</p>

<p>— 王鸎</p>
<p>筆者曾說明積極的心理在困難環境中的重要。但有了積極的心理，尙須要緊接着做建設的工作，因爲建設的工作是不能等待時間的轉變的，有許多建設工作，並非一朝一夕可以成功，因此更需要按步就班地做去，日積月累，就能夠告造成良好的基礎。</p>
<p>中國的工業，本來落後，當此困難重要的時感人肺腑，如果　再不從事建設，就永遠不能和前進國家的生產力量比較，所以爲了生存，爲了克服未來的困難，積極的建設，也可以說是當前產業界的要圖。</p>

<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>戊·燈光：燈光在製造廠中，是很重要的，尤其是製造精細的工作的地方，有許多貸品的不能合乎標準和製造廠裏所發生的意外事件，可以說是由於燈光不足而起，在戰前上海電力公司不時登載廣告，勸廠商注意廠裏的燈光問題，同時還可以派員免費到各廠去查騐燈光問題，他們有一種表，可以測騐燈光是不是合宜。</p>
<p>工廠裏的設備</p>
<p>在建造工廠以後，單是一個廠記，是不能實行生產的，必需要放進必要的設備，這設備包括各種機器，零件，和旋轉零件的必需品如櫥·架之類。</p>
<p>在規模較小的廠中，那末所購置的設備，是力求簡單的，因爲可以用較省的費用，但有時候，一個事業迅速地發展，那末就非要立刻增加設備不可。</p>
<p>在購置設備的時候，有一點是應該考慮到的，就是有許多機器是是新月異的，在經過一個時期以後，就有新式的機器製造出來，那末在購置的時候就是顧到這一點，應該自己有一個預算在幾年之內，是預備購置更新式的機器的，而在生產力方面，力求迅速，使這些機器的折舊能夠在幾年之內打盡，到了有新式的機器的時候，就可以有力量購置。</p>

<p>在廠房裏面的工作，當然要力求便捷，所以在佈置的時候，應該就着工作進行的順序而按次佈置，可以使工作進行非常順利，譬如就一件貸品的完成，要經過十個步驟，那末，如果　把這十個步驟聯緊直來，就可以進行順利，如果把第一個步驟在第一層上做，第二個步驟在第四層上做，第三個步驟在第二層上做，那末原料和在只在過程中的貸品，要拿上拿上，工作不能順利進行時間和人力的耗費，就成爲一種很大的損失，在許多故老廠裏，因爲房屋是逐步添造的，往往有這種現象。</p>
<p>像怡和啤酒公司的廠房共計五層，最先是把原料大麥酵母等，從底層用電力打到最上層，然後經地發酵等工作，一層一層下來，到了最且，裝瓶部份是在底屋的，裝瓶和裝箱的地方很近，而裝箱的地方和旋轉運貸車的地主相連，這種廠房當然是經過專家設計的，所以工作的進行，非常順利。</p>

<p>候王廟祇是一座不大也並不小的廟宇，但跟宋王台一樣，稱爲香港名勝之一，也舆宋王合相距不遠，同是在九能城外的一個小崗上堆。侯王廟特別引人的地言就是廟後的一塊黑岩石山一筆畫成的「雞」字。有人豁它是王義之的手筆，這良然是論傅，也是附會．可是它的筆勢飛舞，也就給中環一家平民飲食店裏在壁上做它那裏生意的輾子了。不了跟着人的後頭而爲着自己的日福。是以每去一次老是向臨裏祇這麼张它一張，便獸在一旁等候祭我的五贓廟了</p>

<p>侯王從那廟碑上戰，他是另有真姓名的，是一個死去了的走方郎中。宋帝　率領殲兵敗逃至此，軍士多半染病，無法找到醫藥，侯王便從夢中示以良方，待帝　醒来命人依方往採取生藥，果然藥到病除．全軍無恙。帝　感他一不夢有功，便認封爲侯王，勒建廟宇，使受後世萬代香火，香火至今稱盛。尤其能舆宋王台局傅不朽。</p>

<p>宋王台舆侯王廟成斜綫相封；去宋王台的沒有一個不去侯王廟，可是去侯王廟的却不一定去米王台。這原故侯王是神，顯有靈廳，可以誘致不少善男倌女；宋王台祇是一座菜邱，略加人工點綴，除了懷古者登臨憑　或者觀光，殊不足與候王廟除了有偶像供人崇拜況，候王廟除了有偶像供人崇拜之外，環崗麗盡有許多吃的地力。而那些地方的陳設：竹儿茅蓬，至有幽趣，加上樣樣现成。幾持荣畦，翹頭可望，熟了的客人可以自選。尤其烹調得法，至可人口，無形中便是那兒熱鬧的一大助力。</p>

<p>侯王廟那裏還有一個奇跡，是一棵大樹下日日蹲着一個中年告化子。他自有人来供養，不曾見他向游人乞討分文，而且總是那麼静穆，不大說話。他尤其有雙冷眼，盡自看羞那些孝心，敬木偶其實孝敬廟祝的迷信之徒。可是他的冷眼並没有甚　存心，祇是一雙冷眠而已。我去候王廟幾年間不下有十次之多，每一回見他都是這麼的形像。我感到稀奇，也覺得納罕，爲的是刺探不出他的原由。</p>

<p>也許你要問了，那麼菠茱巾的鐵質呢？菠茱含有大量的鐵贾，這總穗是有盆的羅。營養學家，對於這一點也有所解答：菠菜中的微質，只有百分之二十。能够爲體吸收。</p>
<p>所以，菠茱並不如人們所宜傅的那樣有益，而盲目的人類，却大吹菠荣。最近十年来，菠茱的消耗员已經增加了八倍，真是可笑亦復可嶙！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Minister Peng Announces Government Communiqué: Peaceful Policy Will Never Change; Always Enduring for the Sake of the Nation to Spur the CCP's Reflection; Troop Deployment Issues Must Be Resolved First <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] At 3:00 PM on June 30th, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department announced the following: Chairman Chiang, on June 22nd, announced the extension of the deadline for ceasing forward pursuit orders until June 30th. During this period, the government repeatedly exercised restraint, hoping to establish a foundation for peaceful unification. However, up to this day, a complete resolution has not been achieved. Nevertheless, the government's policy toward the Communist Party remains consistently focused on a political solution. Especially considering that after our country's eight years of bloody warfare, the people are suffering immensely. We cannot allow them to be subjected to the scourge of war again. Furthermore, the sincere desire for peace in China and the world shown by U.S. government special envoy General Marshall cannot be disappointed. Therefore, the government continues to request General Marshall to continue mediating, hoping for a peaceful solution. However, the Chinese Communist Party must cease its military offensives and destructive actions against transportation to demonstrate its sincerity. Furthermore, it must openly and sincerely discuss the implementation plan for army reorganization and reach an agreement on designated garrison areas within a limited time. If these conditions are met, the government will continue to exercise tolerance. If this issue is not concretely resolved, other agreements cannot be effectively implemented. In particular, if troop deployment locations are not designated, both sides' troops will remain scattered in place, making separation impossible. This will inevitably lead to conflicts. This is why the January 10th ceasefire agreement was ineffective and why the February 27th agreement on restoring transportation has not been implemented to date, with destruction escalating instead. All of this is due to this reason. This is a fact that has occurred over the past six months and is witnessed by both Chinese and foreign observers. Although the ceasefire order has expired, the government's policy of peaceful unification will never change. Unless the Communist Party attacks the National Army, as in the recent fierce attacks day and night in Weixian and Dawenkou in Shandong Province, and near Datong in Shanxi Province, the National Army, not only for self-defense but also to protect the lives and property of the people and maintain local order, has a duty to resist and expel them. Otherwise, the central government's troops will not take military action against the Communist Army, waiting patiently for the resolution of the outstanding issues. It is deeply hoped that this painstaking effort of enduring for the sake of the nation and striving for a political solution will prompt deep reflection by the CCP, leading to a sincere and honest agreement. This is what the government and the people of the whole country earnestly hope for.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] At 3:00 PM this afternoon, Minister Peng Xuepei of the Central Propaganda Department, in the conference room of the National Goods Building, announced to more than fifty Chinese and foreign reporters in the capital that Chairman Chiang of the National Government still adheres to a policy of political solution to the Communist Party issue, urges the CCP to reflect, and cease attacking the National Army and destroying transportation, so that the people suffering from eight years of war will not suffer from war again. Minister Peng first announced this public announcement to domestic reporters for twenty minutes. Afterwards, foreign reporters swarmed in, and Minister Peng announced it in English to foreign reporters in his office. Subsequently, as reporters from various newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai arrived one after another, Deputy Minister Xu Xiaoyan re-announced the original public announcement to the later domestic reporters, which lasted until 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] This morning at 9:30 AM, Envoy Marshall visited the Chairman's residence and had a long talk with the Chairman for two hours. After the Envoy left, the Chairman immediately convened important government officials such as Wang Shijie and Peng Xuepei to discuss matters. In addition, Envoy Marshall met with Zhou Enlai at approximately 2:00 PM this afternoon and conveyed to Zhou the Chairman's opinion of enduring for the sake of the nation and hoping for reflection from the CCP.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Although Special Envoy Marshall has not been able to resolve the Chinese civil strife today, he has succeeded in getting the government to maintain the status quo and continue negotiations. According to the government side, Envoy Marshall cannot stay in China indefinitely, which is a key factor in the negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Written Statement from the CCP Delegation: Willing to Continue Discussions and Seek a Solution Under the Auspices of Envoy Marshall <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] The spokesman for the CCP delegation issued a written statement at 8:00 PM this evening, stating in brief: A long-term ceasefire and a comprehensive ceasefire have always been our consistent position. Unfortunately, it has not been agreed upon by the government authorities, leading to the current abrupt and uncertain situation. During the eight-day extension of the ceasefire, general agreements have been reached on issues such as completely ceasing conflicts in the Northeast, restoring transportation, and resolving certain disputes in the Executive Headquarters and the groups. The revised clauses of the military reorganization plan, through the efforts of General Marshall, the enthusiastic efforts of the third party, and the greatest concessions from the CCP side, could have completed a preliminary agreement. However, due to the government's insistence on "unreasonable demands," the agreement was not reached. We express great regret for this. The public announcement announced today by Mr. Peng Xuepei, Minister of Propaganda of the Kuomintang, is very special in form. On the one hand, it declares that the central government's army will not take military action against the Communist army, but it does not state whether the government has issued this order, especially whether this ceasefire is long-term or short-term. But in any case, the CCP side still insists on striving for peace and opposing civil war, and is still willing to continue discussions under the auspices of General Marshall to seek a political solution.</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai's Remarks</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, 30th Dispatch] The CCP representatives held a press conference at 8:00 PM this afternoon. Zhou Enlai replied to reporters that we agreed that some local troops could be transferred during the military reorganization, but the government was not satisfied with this and wanted the CCP to withdraw its troops and government from northern Jiangsu and Rehe. We really cannot consider or accept this. He continued to mention the compromise proposal put forward by Envoy Marshall, saying that the CCP agreed to the vast majority and the most important parts of it. He also said that in future continued discussions, the two methods of three-person meetings and off-site consultations will be adopted. Zhou denied the rumors that the Communist army would withdraw from northern Jiangsu, and declared that the Communist army had no intention of attacking Datong.</p>
<p>Minister Peng's Response</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] After Zhou Enlai's press conference held at 8:00 PM this evening, our newspaper's reporter specially visited Minister Peng at his residence to inquire about his opinion on the statement issued by the CCP delegation. Peng replied briefly: "If the Communist army does not attack, we will naturally not pursue them. We have no orders, and the army will naturally not attack them." This also explains that the order to cease pursuit has not yet expired, and there is no need for a formal order to pile bed upon bed. Moreover, this public announcement has reached all newspapers and news agencies across the country, which is much faster than an order.</p>

<h3 id="e16">The Past Twenty-Three Days: Progress of Peace Negotiations <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The peace negotiations, lasting twenty-three days, have concluded at noon today. This newspaper has provided detailed reports on the negotiation process daily. The results of the negotiations are summarized below:</p>
<p>Northeast Ceasefire Issue</p>
<p>Although an agreement has been reached, the ratio of military reorganization in the Northeast has not been determined, and the issue of the communist army's garrison areas in the Northeast has not been resolved. Although the communist army has expressed its willingness to withdraw from Harbin, it is unwilling to abandon its established administrative authority in Harbin, as well as its unique economic organization and tax system.</p>
<p>Restoration of Transportation Issue</p>
<p>Both parties have reached an agreement on dismantling fortifications and unifying the administrative authority of railways and traffic police. However, due to the unresolved issue of the communist army's garrison areas along the railway lines and inside the passes, the agreement has not been signed. Currently, Colonel Hill, the American representative of the Transportation Management Section of the Peiping Military Mediation Department, is working with transportation representatives from the government and the Communist Party to inspect the situation on various sections of the Jinpu Railway in Shandong Province and conduct research. They are preparing to repair the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways first. According to various investigations, the key obstacle to restoring transportation is the undetermined garrison areas of the communist army. If the communist army does not quickly withdraw from the railway areas, the road restoration project cannot be advanced. The American side is now deeply aware of this and no longer believes that sending two or three transportation executive groups can mediate disputes and restore transportation. The Communist Party also admits that the transportation issue is related to military affairs and no longer pretends and manipulates the road restoration personnel, exacerbating the difficulty of this issue. The government's attitude towards the withdrawal of the communist army along the railway lines is very firm. Whether this matter can be resolved in the shortest possible time is something no one dares to predict at this time.</p>
<p>Reorganization and Unification Issue</p>
<p>Regarding the negotiation process, government representatives have never disclosed a word to the outside world. The news disclosed by various newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai in recent days is mostly reliable because none of the parties have publicly denied it. This issue was originally extremely complex, but after long-term discussions and careful research, all parties are aware that whether peace can be achieved and whether conflict can be avoided depends not only on the ratio of military reorganization, but also on the unresolved issue of the communist army's garrison areas. The root cause of all sudden attacks is that the communist army still does not have a fixed garrison area. It is like unruly children without a home, monks without a temple, and wild horses without reins. Therefore, all acts of playing with guns and sticks are inevitable. Therefore, demarcating the communist army's defense zone is actually a crucial plan for the future. If this issue is resolved reasonably, the communist army can take a break, and because supplies are available and food and clothing are not lacking, all problems can be easily solved.</p>
<p>The So-Called Concessions of the Communist Party</p>
<p>According to a certain party's disclosure today, the Communist Party has agreed to withdraw from Harbin in the Northeast, and in the Rehe and Chahar areas, the Communist Party is willing to abandon the area south of Zhangjiakou, indicating a reduction in the threat to Peiping and Tianjin. In northern Jiangsu, northeastern Anhui, and Jiaodong, the Communist Party is willing to reduce the number of troops stationed and withdraw in batches and phases, but must retain the established political, economic, and even social rights and interests of the Communist Party in the above-mentioned areas. In short, even the smallest village head appointed by the central government and the people's organizations guided by the Communist Party, even the smallest barbers' union, must be guaranteed to exist permanently. This is what the Communist Party believes is the most ideal "masterpiece" of the past eight or nine months of negotiations.</p>

<p>[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 30th] The Northern Jiangsu Counties Refugee Relief Promotion Association held an emergency meeting on the 29th and decided to select 8,000 refugees from various counties to walk to Nanjing to earnestly petition Chairman Chiang, Special Envoy Marshall, and Zhou Enlai, implementing four demands: (1) Safe return home immediately, (2) Stop the communist army from controlling and breaching the Yun Canal dikes, (3) The communist army immediately withdraws from Northern Jiangsu, (4) Willing to voluntarily arm and return home. After hearing the news, the local military and political leaders summoned the refugee representatives, personally offered comfort, and encouraged them to respect the spirit of Chairman Chiang's magnanimity and tolerance. They asked them to prioritize national affairs and not expand their actions for the time being. The representatives understood this and then changed their plan to send 100 people to Nanjing, and appointed representatives Dai Tianqiu, Yang Jinren, and Hu Zheng to Zhenjiang to meet with the press to explain the determination of the people of Northern Jiangsu. If the delegation does not achieve its goals within ten days of arriving in Nanjing, they are determined to fight to the death and ask the press for strong support.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 30th] According to Xie Zhigang, director of the Yangzhou office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference, according to past investigations, the total number of refugees from various counties in northern Jiangsu who are displaced in Yangzhou is 48,167, all waiting to be fed. They are currently being provided with relief separately. The old, weak, disabled, out-of-school youth, and impoverished children are listed as urgent relief cases. It is stipulated that the 500 tons of flour issued have now arrived in Yangzhou with 200 tons, which will be distributed within days. The various facilities in the 20 reception and reception centers in various counties are being improved.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 30th] There are many refugees in the urban and rural areas of Xuzhou and in Yangshan and Huangkou. After investigation, it is necessary to provide relief to more than 230,000 people. More than 15,000 people are gathered in the suburbs of Xuzhou Airport, the old Yellow River embankment, and the Mapaoshan area. There are still many others scattered among relatives and friends. In the past two days, reporters have inspected the refugee areas and seen the miserable conditions of their lack of clothing, food, and medicine, which is even worse than in Yangzhou and Taixian. The Jiangsu Provincial Branch has now transported 2,000 tons of relief flour, but each three people can only be allocated one bag, and each person only has one week's worth of food, which is far too little. Therefore, they all eagerly hope that the government will continue to allocate flour for relief. According to the reporter's observation, if the Executive Yuan does not increase the allocation of 5,000 tons of flour in July and use it exclusively for relief in Xuzhou, then these 300,000 starving people will have to sit and wait for death.</p>

<p>But Not Applicable to People of Color</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The China Natural Science Society News reported that there are three kinds of medicines for treating malaria: quinine, atabrine and plasmochin, although the curative effect is good, there have been many recurrences, especially malignant malaria. During this war, the US Scientific Research and Development Bureau allocated $7 million to secretly study new antimalarial drugs. The scientists participating were divided into 40 groups, and experiments were carried out in dozens of research institutes. Up to 14,000 kinds of compounds were synthesized and tested. Until last year, when the 13,276th drug was tested, it was found that it had a particularly strong curative effect on malaria, so the drug was named "SN13276." This drug is one of the compounds of plasmochin, and its effect is stronger than various antimalarial drugs, and the number of doses can be reduced, and it can especially prevent the recurrence of malignant malaria. The only disadvantage is that it is easy to cause hemolysis and produce serious side effects in people of color and mixed-race people, so American scientists are still continuing their research. In addition, a deadline has been set for the invention of a new drug that may be used to treat leukemia.</p>

<p>[United News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th] Huang Le, a port engineering expert from the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, went to Shanghai yesterday to purchase heavy machinery in order to dredge the Pearl River. This project requires a cost of 81,657.60 yuan and is one of the four major plans to improve Guangzhou's transportation. The Executive Yuan has allocated 4.5 million yuan to cover the survey costs. In addition to improving the main river channels, the Executive Yuan also announced its hope to bear the labor costs for repairing 36 embankments and the Lubaohu water gate in the Pearl River basin in order to protect 2,776,000 acres of farmland from floods. The total cost of labor and materials requires 2,875,310,000 yuan. The Executive Yuan will allocate 1,946,000 pounds of flour to the workers. The fourth project will be to develop the wasteland in the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island, which can probably resettle 5,000 refugees from the war zone.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Editorial: Hoping Everyone Will Deeply Reflect <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The extension of the ceasefire order for eight days expired at noon yesterday. The people of the whole country are worried about whether there is hope for peace and feel extremely anxious. Chairman Chiang still adhered to his policy of peaceful unification, endured for the sake of the country, and issued another announcement welcomed by the whole country: as long as the Communist Party stops military offensives, stops destroying transportation, and sincerely negotiates the implementation plan for military reorganization, and establishes an agreement on the areas where troops will be stationed within a time limit, the government will still tolerate it. Chairman Chiang's wise decision fully proves the government's painstaking efforts to seek a political solution, allowing some Chinese and foreign people who suspected that the government would use force to suddenly realize. Whether China can achieve peaceful unification in the future depends on whether the Communist Party can truly deeply reflect.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the situation before and after the Political Consultative Conference, let's just talk about the facts of the past month: for the sake of the future of the nation and the country, the government has always held the spirit of "enduring for the sake of the country" and does not want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build the country. On June 6, it issued a ceasefire order, limiting the negotiations to resolve the three major issues of stopping the conflict, restoring transportation, and implementing the military reorganization and unification plan within fifteen days. After fifteen days of negotiations, there was still no result. In order to give the Communist Party one last chance, Chairman Chiang extended the ceasefire order by eight days, hoping that the Communist Party would not miss this last chance again. However, in these last eight days, the Communist Party still played its most brilliant tricks, delaying the negotiations and failing to reach a conclusion. The words were very beautiful, but in reality, they were completely irrelevant. As a result, the situation was uncertain, making our people dizzy, as if they had encountered a riddle of the times. At the last moment when the ceasefire order expired at noon yesterday, everyone was worried and anxious. When they heard Chairman Chiang's announcement, they felt relieved. How could our people not express their joy!</p>
<p>However, after being relieved, let's calm down and think about it. We feel that we cannot be too optimistic about the future of the domestic situation. Why? Because Chairman Chiang's announcement only shows that the government is willing to strive for peaceful unification at any cost and does not want to see the people suffer from war again. However, peaceful unification cannot be achieved by the government's efforts alone, and whether war can be avoided or not depends on the actual actions of the Communist Party. We must pay attention to the word "reciprocal" in "reciprocal tolerance." It can only be considered "reciprocal tolerance" if both sides can make concessions. If the government is tolerant but the Communist Party is not, and continues to attack Weixian and Datong day and night, then the government's willingness to "appease" may not be able to avoid war. Therefore, the key to China's transformation from chaos to governance and from war to peace can be said to be in the hands of the Communist Party. The more the government is generous and retreats, the more we must persuade the Communist Party to realize it as soon as possible. Everyone should "endure for the sake of the country" and, under the continued mediation of Special Envoy Marshall, establish an agreement on the implementation plan for military reorganization. Otherwise, even if Chairman Chiang has this wise and generous announcement, and the Communist Party still acts as it did before, will the people's hopes not be dashed again? Today, I would like to sincerely advise the Communist Party again: every time the government makes a concession, the people will hate the Communist Party's refusal to make concessions even more. Therefore, if the current stalemate continues to drag on, and the Communist Party still does not reflect and change its military offensives, destruction of transportation, and its style of occupying territory and refusing to accept military reorganization, then the Communist Party will be destroying its own future in China.</p>
<p>Combining the recent negotiation issues and the opinions of all parties, we can know that the focus of the dispute between the two sides is one is the issue of military reorganization, and the other is the issue of defense zones. These are the implementation steps for the nationalization of the army. Regarding the former, the plan for the demobilization, reorganization, and unification of the army has long been signed and established by the three parties. It only needs to be implemented. There is no reason for the Communist Party to demand a change in the ratio of the Kuomintang and Communist armies. Regarding the latter, the Communist Party's opinions have been inconsistent, making it difficult for us to understand the Communist Party's true intentions. In fact, the demarcation of defense zones is the most practical way to avoid military conflict at present. Otherwise, if the troops of both sides are scattered in their original locations and cannot be separated from each other, how can conflict be guaranteed to be avoided? If the Communist Party sincerely seeks peace, there is really no reason to refuse to designate defense zones.</p>
<p>Finally, speaking of political democratization, it is of course the future path of Chinese politics. Although we know that the government has long had a great determination to reform politics, and the government has indeed set steps to achieve democratic politics, what is lacking is that we believe that the current government still lacks a spirit of automatically and proactively implementing democratization. In fact, the Communist Party's military offensives and destruction of transportation are one thing, while the government's proactive reorganization of the national government, accommodating various parties and factions (parties willing to cooperate with the government but not possessing troops) and talents without party affiliation, and jointly governing the country to show its sincerity of "the world is for the public," is another thing. For example, the government's merger of the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Ministry of Military Orders is indeed a timely measure to adjust military institutions, but why has the government not yet proactively changed the system of exercising power and transferred the power of the Supreme National Defense Council to the National Government Committee after accommodating various parties and non-party figures? The government should not ask whether the Communist Party is willing to participate, but take the lead in showing that it will automatically and publicly open up power, make a fresh start, and open the first door to political democratization. Secondly, when the government continues to negotiate with the Communist Party, it may as well reflect on why the Communist Party has become so rampant. Do the central and even local political facilities have any gaps that have been called a "hotbed" for cultivating the Communist Party? The government officials must be greatly enlightened and fundamentally and proactively reform their politics so that even if the Communist Party deliberately creates war, it will be spurned by the people, and its strength will not need to be valued. Therefore, instead of merely hoping that the Communist Party will abandon its policies, the government should turn around and first reform its own political power and start afresh with the people.</p>

<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 30th] According to sources from the Food Office, the current stock of grain in Peiping is only over 17.8 million catties. The population of Peiping is 1.6 million. If each person consumes one catty of grain per day, it will only be enough for ten days. On the other hand, the Communist Party is buying grain in the countryside at high prices. The grain in the countryside does not enter the city, and some grain markets in the city are also attracted by high prices and transported to the countryside.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Gao Zhongqin Invents Electric Chinese Typewriter <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Can Type 45 Characters Per Minute</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 30th] The International Business Machines Corporation recently announced that it has manufactured an "electric" Chinese typewriter. The machine was invented by Gao Zhongqin, director of the Central News Agency's Telecommunications Department, and was officially exhibited here today. The typewriter is made using electric and mechanical principles. It has 34 keys, divided into four groups. The typewriter is very easy to use. Pressing four keys (one key in each group) can produce a total of 5,400 characters. These 5,400 characters are divided into three categories: the first category has 1,000 characters, which are the most commonly used, accounting for 90% of the number of occurrences in daily communications; the second category has about 3,000 characters, which are the less commonly used; and the rest are the third category. After such classification, the movement of the cylinder can be minimized as much as possible. Gao said that the principle of the electric Chinese typewriter is roughly similar to the principle of automatic telephones, but of course it is ten thousand times more complicated. The machine is controlled by alternating current and can type 40 to 45 characters per minute. The character keys also include English letters, punctuation marks, and Chinese phonetic symbols for use when needed.</p>

<p>[Our Nantung Correspondent] Colonel Cumenhan, the US representative of the Huaiyin Executive Headquarters, was recently transferred south for the first time to conduct mediation work. He was eager to go to the Communist area for a field investigation. On the 29th at 9:00 AM, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Belan Kehustuo, he traveled by jeep to Rugao. En route, between Baipu and Linzi, they were suddenly attacked by bandits. The representatives and his party, perceiving the unusual situation, immediately decided to turn back, returning to Tongcheng at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The US representatives are tight-lipped about the details, maintaining silence. County Magistrate Yang and others, upon hearing the news, personally went to express their condolences. The US representatives originally intended to insist that a government representative accompany them, but after repeated consideration by Group Leader Yang Chao, they had not yet departed, thus narrowly escaping misfortune. It can be said they were fortunate.</p>

<p>[Our Jingjiang Correspondent] On the 27th, Communist troops forcibly collected public grain from the people near Xima Bridge in the Fourth District and held a meeting at Xinguo Dai. Upon receiving this information, the National Army immediately led the Fourth District Self-Defense Force to deploy defenses. The Communist troops then mobilized a hundred armed men, encircling from the east and cutting off the National Army's return route, resulting in a conflict. The sound of gunfire and hand grenades erupted, audible even within the city. After more than an hour of fierce fighting, the Communist troops finally retreated in defeat. In this battle, more than ten Communist soldiers were killed or wounded. The National Army intended to pursue, but the bridges along the road had been destroyed, preventing them from advancing. They then returned safely.</p>

<p>[Another Report] Recently, water and land transportation from Huangqiao to Jingcheng has been blocked by Communist troops. Since the 23rd, no passes have been issued for travel south, and passage north of Gushan is also prohibited. According to people arriving from Huangqiao, the Communist troops have dismantled more than sixty bunkers, and all the bricks and wood, along with the confiscated public grain, have been loaded onto hundreds of boats and shipped north day and night. Furthermore, several hundred young women have been forcibly conscripted, assigned numbers, and sent to the Yanfu area.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Moldy Grain and Forage Cannot be Auctioned</p>
<p>The Third Inspection and Acceptance Committee of the Ministry of War announced that a batch of moldy grain and forage was previously stored in Suzhou warehouses. It was approved to be transferred to the Wuxian County Government for distribution to the poor for relief. Subsequently, the County Government organized a committee to receive the moldy grain and forage and openly invited bids for auction, with the proceeds to be used for local relief projects. The Inspection Committee had no prior knowledge of the bidding and auction, which was not its original intention. The committee telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense for approval. They received a reply from the Chief of Staff stating that the grain must still be donated to the poor and not auctioned. The committee has now notified the County Government to comply.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Requesting the Yuan and Ministries to Relieve Industry</p>
<p>The Southern Jiangsu Branch of the National Industrial Association believes that Southern Jiangsu industry is facing a crisis. Some factories are requesting layoffs and wage reductions. The crux of the problem lies in: 1. Shortage of funds; 2. Heavy interest burdens; 3. Lack of industrial loans; 4. Restriction by cheap foreign goods; 5. Inability to bear heavy donations and taxes; 6. Increased wages and frequent labor unrest, with workers making excessive demands. If these difficulties are not fundamentally eliminated, the future of Chinese industry will be unimaginable. On the 28th, the association telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Economy, requesting prompt measures to be taken to provide relief and avert the industrial crisis.</p>
<p>Jiangyin: Cloth Sales Stagnant, Plead for Industrial Loans</p>
<p>Before the war, Jiangyin cloth factories were known to be flourishing. During the period of enemy occupation, they suffered severe damage and were unable to resume operations. After the victory, for the sake of livelihood, the industry gradually resumed production, but their economic strength was based on depleting their savings. Recently, rice prices have soared, wages have increased, and cloth sales have been stagnant. Existing capital is insufficient to meet operational needs. If loans are given at high interest rates, it would be like drinking poison to quench thirst. The industry association, represented by Zhu Yaohang and others, specially submitted a petition to the Provisional Council to telegraph the Ministries of Finance and Economy, and the Joint Office of the Four Banks, requesting low-interest industrial loans to maintain the dying cloth factory industry and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers.</p>
<p>Songjiang: Traitor Yuan Yingjie Arrested in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yuan Yingjie, the former commander of the Independent 5th Regiment of the puppet Second Army stationed in Songcheng, and concurrently the Major General Advisor of the puppet Military Commission, arrived in Songjiang in the summer of the 28th year of the Republic under the guise of the Commander-in-Chief of the 6th Route of the puppet Peace and National Salvation Army. Later, he was reassigned as the Brigade Commander of the 26th Brigade of the puppet 13th Division, designating the area from Dongting Bridge to the Old East Gate in the city as the garrison area for his troops. The puppet soldiers were rampant, and the people glared at them with disdain. Yuan Yingjie himself, when entering or leaving, would always post sentries and enforce martial law, displaying his arrogant power and considering himself invincible. The County Government learned that the traitor was hiding in Shanghai, so it sent a criminal police team to arrest him. On the 28th, he was escorted back to the county for detention and interrogation.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Completion of the Deqing-Hangzhou Telephone Line</p>
<p>The long-distance telephone line of the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, after active construction, has completed the installation of one pair of double-wire lines to Pingwang, Deqing, and Changxing. Recently, the Deqing-Hangzhou section of the double-wire telephone line has also been completed by the 10th Line Construction Engineering Team of the bureau. The line construction project from Deqing through Wukang Mogan Mountain will also begin immediately. In the future, communication between counties should be more convenient.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Superfortress Dropped Atomic Bomb from 30,000 Feet This Morning; Yesterday, All Preparations Were Completed Awaiting Weather Report; Target Ships Ringed the Lagoon Like a Floating City <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, From the US Ship Appalachian outside Bikini Atoll, 29th] Approximately 40,000 personnel participating in the Bikini atomic bomb test have completed all preparations. Today there is nothing to do but await the release of the final weather report to determine whether the atomic bomb will be dropped as scheduled. A Navy spokesman said that the weather is expected to be good, but the atomic bomb may be dropped one hour earlier than scheduled to allow for clearer visibility. (6:30 AM Shanghai time Monday morning, originally scheduled for 7:30 AM) The Superfortress that will drop the atomic bomb today underwent a final inspection, and it was discovered that one of its engines was not in perfect condition and was immediately replaced. The originally scheduled three test flights over the target have been canceled, so the official drop can be held earlier. The accuracy of the bomber crews dropping bombs from 30,000 feet has amazed the officials in charge of the test. Major Swenkt, the pilot of the Superfortress, told reporters that he was confident that he could drop the atomic bomb within 300 feet of the target. In addition to the crew, there are also one Army and one Air Force personnel, and one scientist on board, who will assemble the atomic bomb in the air to reduce its danger.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bikini, 29th] On the eve of the atomic bomb test, thousands of observers became increasingly nervous, awaiting the hour of the drop. When the hour arrives, the Bikini lagoon will emit the heat and light of a thousand suns. But amidst the excited crowd, only Major Wood remained calm, temporarily leaving his job as a store clerk in New Jersey to serve here as one of the US Army's best bombardiers. He said with confidence, "I will hit it with one shot."</p>
<p>Precise Instruments Measure the Power</p>
<p>The preparations for the July 1st test viewing have been completed, weather permitting. Seventy-seven warships surround the target center ship "Nevada," arranged in the lagoon. Spectroscopic equipment will be used during the test, and scientists will be able to see the entire explosion within the first minute. They can measure heat of millions of degrees and the speed of shrapnel. Various instruments can fully measure the power of the bomb. Judging from the arrangement of the ships, even if the fleet is not destroyed, the people on board will be killed or injured. All the ships are stronger than most houses, and the water covering the bottom of the ships will protect most of them from being shattered. It should be known that the atomic bomb is strictly a land weapon. The aerial explosion method on July 1 is not used to represent the attack of the atomic bomb on the Navy, but strictly used to test the power of the attack on the city, so the parking of each target ship is almost identical to the small city. The ships are densely packed close to the center, like standing [Heaven]'s [Natural] central area with more than 20 military [earning], forming a [formation], with a diameter of more than one mile. The arrangement of the central military [earning] is particularly dense, and from two miles away, the gap between the ships cannot be seen. The layout of this floating city is like an old-fashioned metropolis, with streets branching out from the central building in all directions. The battleship "Nevada" is in the center, but the tallest building in the center is the Japanese battleship "Nagato," which looks like a spire rising in the city.</p>
<p>Nevada: Target Core</p>
<p>[Special Telegram from Central News Agency reporter Song Dehe on the US ship Nevada in Bikini Lagoon, 29th] This old US battleship "Nevada" will be used as the center of the target ships for the atomic bomb test. Various types of military equipment are equipped on board, from tanks and airplanes to uniforms, fabrics, and food. If the atomic bomb is dropped and detonated as expected, all of the above-mentioned equipment and materials will be subjected to the white heat and radiation caused by the atomic bomb. Today, all reporters were allowed to visit the ship, but only the exterior was allowed to be viewed. The exterior looks like a modern military science museum, with tanks, artillery, amphibious vehicles, airplanes, and various types of aircraft made of different materials. One-inch armored steel plates, everything used in modern warfare, and various newly invented items that have never been tested before will be tested under the atomic bomb explosion. Hours before the atomic bomb is dropped, the crew will abandon the ship and replace them with pigs, sheep, and mice. These animals are already on board and will be placed in different locations at that time. The hair of some will be cut short, and some will be completely cut off, with special preparations made on their skin. Around this central target, there are more than 70 other ships, all prepared in the same way as the "Nevada." These target ships are anchored very close together. If the explosion of the atomic bomb is exactly as expected, then one bomb can sink all the target ships completely, or seriously damage them.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Nagato: Serving as Cannon Fodder</p>
<p>The Japanese battleship "Nagato" and the cruiser "Sakawa" are only a few hundred feet away from the "Nevada." The ships are extremely dilapidated and driven by the US Navy. The German cruiser "Prince Eugen" has a very beautiful appearance. Looking around at these concentrated targets, and recalling the many reports by the US side to reporters on the preparation and planning of this test in the past few weeks, I can't help but feel that why not use this energy and enthusiasm in peacetime production?</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, San Francisco, 29th] It is reported that the US Navy will engage in long-distance measurement and recording to prove whether the secret test of atomic bomb bombing in other parts of the world can be detected in the United States.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 29th] The US scientific community's assurance that the atomic bomb bombing test is harmless to the world has aroused dissatisfaction among European scientists. Swiss physicist Katte, who is now in Paris preparing for next year's deep-water pressure test, said that the atomic bomb explosion may cause a series of uncontrollable atomic explosions. Bee's words are consistent with the fears of former French scientist Berthelot. According to Berthelot, there is also a core explosive force in the water, which is the same as that contained in the uranium nucleus, so an atomic bomb may cause an accidental explosion. Before throwing an atomic bomb into the ocean, a limited test should be held on a small body of water.</p>
<p>Atomic Bomb Can Break Hurricanes</p>
<p>[Special Telegram from Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Tokyo Meteorological Observatory meteorologist Fujiwara Hei said today that atomic bombs may be used to break up hurricanes. Fujiwara's theory is based on the phenomena that occurred in the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He said that half an hour after the first atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima, the blue sky turned dark, and then it started to rain. Within an hour, the drizzle turned into a tropical downpour. The same phenomenon occurred after the second atomic bomb was dropped in Nagasaki. According to theory, atomic energy can indeed change the climate. If an atomic bomb (or another form of atomic energy) is thrown at the appropriate location in a highly destructive hurricane, it can cause the hurricane to shift to a different line that is harmless. The power of an ordinary hurricane is only one percent of the power of an atomic bomb, so the atomic bomb has sufficient power to control hurricanes.</p>

Regarding the issue of freedom of navigation on the Danube, the proposal put forward by the French representative has been agreed to by the other three foreign ministers, thus the meeting today has made great progress. Regarding the distribution of the Italian Navy, the four foreign ministers have reached an agreement on the number of warships that Italy should retain. Regarding the convening date of the 21-nation peace conference, after a long period of discussion, US Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov each held their own opinions and refused to budge. Until recently, they still agreed to the compromise plan proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault. Therefore, it seems that the four foreign ministers' meeting can decide the convening date of the peace conference when they meet on July 1.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Trieste, 29th] In this accident-prone port of Trieste, political sentiments are high today. Armed conflicts erupted between pro-Italian and pro-Yugoslav crowds, turning into street fighting. As a result, more than twenty people were injured, three of them seriously. The method of disposing of the port is the most fiercely debated point in the post-war peace treaty with Italy. The Paris foreign ministers' meeting found this extremely difficult to deal with.</p>
<h3 id="e42">US Atomic Bomb Manufacturing Plant Plans to Increase Production of Radioactive Elements for Nationwide Medical and Industrial Use <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 29th] The Manhattan Project, responsible for manufacturing atomic bombs, announced today its plan to provide atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Radioactive material produced from the same "uranium pile" used to create atomic bomb components will be distributed to hospitals, universities, and scientific and industrial laboratories for examining substances within the human body, studying their structure and diseases, and potentially for medicinal treatments. Currently, only US institutions can obtain allocations, and full supply is not yet possible until production facilities are increased. Although current production is limited, large-scale manufacturing is expected in the future, and hospitals, schools, industrial and non-industrial laboratories, and clinical research institutions can already apply for small quantities. If production can be increased and widely distributed, it will undoubtedly greatly benefit peacetime research in physics, chemistry, metallurgy, and medicine. According to the Manhattan Project report:</p>
<p>Uranium Pile</p>
<p>produces isotopes far more efficiently than atomic fission reactors. For example, radioactive carbon, which is urgently needed by researchers, can be produced several times more effectively by "uranium piles" than by atomic fission reactors. Before the war, the production of isotopes using atomic fission reactors was insufficient, hindering research progress, and only a few people were able to apply radioactive isotopes. Now that radioactive isotopes can be produced on a large scale, more significant advancements in scientific applications are expected. Although the production cost of isotopes is high, they can now be obtained at reasonable prices. The cost of the research quantities of important isotopes should no longer deter ordinary scientific institutions. Some isotopes can produce 37 million rays per second, with each ray having an energy of up to 2.5 million electron volts, so their handling requires special care. The time required for a radioactive substance to lose half of its radioactivity ranges from a few hours to more than thirty years. Radioactive isotopes have two</p>
<p>Important Uses:</p>
<p>(1) As atomic tracers in chemical biology and technology, (2) As therapeutic agents for specific diseases. Radioactive isotopes can be used as tracers because the radiation they emit can be detected with precision instruments. Therefore, radioactive carbon can be used to detect the action of ordinary carbon in the human body and various organisms. Radioactive carbon does not interfere with ordinary carbon in the human body because its chemical properties are the same. Radioactive carbon-14, different from stable carbon-12 and carbon-13, can greatly benefit the study of the functions of various organisms, including the mechanisms and growth of normal and diseased tissues, and all the functions of animals and plants. In addition, the production of radioactive phosphorus, sulfur, and iodine has also increased compared to the past. Radioactive phosphorus, previously produced in very limited quantities by atomic fission reactors, can now be used to treat leukemia, a cancerous condition of blood cells, because phosphorus tends to concentrate in blood-forming organs, so radioactive phosphorus can be used to attack the disease, like radium needles and phototherapy. Radioactive iodine is used to treat thyroid diseases because iodine concentrates in the thyroid gland, and it can also be used for detection to determine whether the iodine used is indeed in the thyroid gland. Radioactive sulfur is used with sulfa drugs to detect the body's response to these drugs and their</p>
<p>Bacterial Action,</p>
<p>which is extremely important. Radioactive strontium can be used to treat osteosarcoma because scientists know that strontium tends to concentrate in bone tissue. Injecting a radioactive substance at one point in the arteries and veins and calculating the time it takes to pass through can measure blood flow velocity. According to the Army Department's announcement, radioactive isotopes can also be used as tracers in industrial chemistry and metallurgy. This was already known when radioactive materials were produced using atomic fission reactors in the past. Radioactive substances with this property can be used to detect gases flowing through complex pipes and reactors. Petroleum engineers use them to map oil pools. Radioactive hydrogen is used to test oil refining procedures. Atomic scientists say that the radiation emitted by radioactive substances is a cheap and easy-to-use radiation source for</p>
<p>X-Ray Irradiation</p>
<p>of large pieces of metal and opaque materials to detect flaws. The isotopes currently produced can be divided into two main categories: (1) Byproducts of the fission of uranium-235 by neutrons; (2) Non-fissionable materials added to uranium piles and transformed into radioactive materials by atomic bombardment. In the first category, the uranium atom is shattered to form a series of new elements, which is true alchemy. However, in the uranium pile, these newly produced elements are not as stable as naturally occurring ones and are radioactive. No fewer than sixteen elements are produced in this way, including cerium, europium, promethium, and neodymium. In the second category, adding foreign substances to the uranium pile can cause several reactions: (1) Changing non-radioactive elements into radioactive elements of the same type; (2) Changing non-radioactive elements into completely different radioactive elements; (3) First changing non-radioactive elements into radioactive elements of the same type, and then splitting them into completely different radioactive elements. Materials added to the uranium pile are first placed in specially made metal containers, and the procedure is extremely meticulous and requires extreme caution. All groups using radioactive isotopes for basic research or applied science should publish their research findings to promote science. The distribution method is adjusted and supervised by the Isotope Advisory Committee, while the adjustment of its production and development is managed by a technical committee composed of representatives from the Manhattan Project's major laboratories.</p>

<p>Contains Seven Points</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 29th Dispatch] This afternoon, Foreign Ministers' Conference Chairman Bidault proposed an amended compromise plan for the Trieste issue, including seven points: (1) The port of Trieste and its surrounding territory should become an autonomous region for a period of ten years, jointly administered by Italy and Yugoslavia in addition to the four major powers, with the territorial integrity guaranteed by the UN Security Council. (2) The governor of the region should be nominated by an agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia. If a candidate cannot be proposed through this method, then the four major powers will appoint one separately. (3) A parliament elected by secret universal suffrage will exercise legislative powers. (4) An administrative council of six people will be formed, with the four major Allied powers and Italy and Yugoslavia appointing a governor who can supervise the administrative council to have governmental and administrative power and must maintain order and guarantee the progress of general public affairs. (5) Legislative and judicial organizations should guarantee respect for the people's right to establish and use schools in the local residents' language and to participate in government work. (6) A supervisory body composed of representatives of the Security Council and the four major powers should be formed. The administrative council should submit a report to it every year. The supervisory body should be responsible for reviewing generally applicable laws and regulations. Any disputes or difficulties can be submitted to this supervisory body. (7) Before the end of the ten-year period, the four powers may conduct a new review of the various laws and regulations to be able to submit UN recommendations at any time. Molotov believes that this plan is still unsatisfactory. He said that this is a temporary nature and may affect the emotions of Yugoslavs, and he believes that it is better to establish permanent rules.</p>

<p>A Total of 120,000 Deaths; White House Issues Report</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] President Truman previously appointed a fact-finding committee to investigate the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The committee was composed of 300 civilian experts, 50 military officers, and 500 soldiers. The report has been submitted and was released by the White House. It stated: A total of 80,000 people were killed in Hiroshima, and thousands were seriously injured. The area had a population of 245,000, of which one-third were wiped out. The reason for such severe losses was that all residents were working at the time of the bombing, and because the US aircraft fleet was not large, the Hiroshima local officials failed to detect and issue air raid warnings in time, coupled with unfavorable terrain. Hiroshima was almost completely destroyed. Nagasaki suffered less damage because it was located in a deep valley, with only 40,000 deaths. When the atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima, flames flew wildly, causing high-speed hot winds, flowing more than fifty miles per hour. When it fell on Nagasaki, it emitted a strong flash of light, followed by a deafening roar, and then caused a high degree of heat. The atomic bomb can kill 20,000 people and injure 43,000 people in every square mile. As for ordinary bombs, even if hundreds of aircraft drop them at the same time, they can only kill 1,000 people and injure 2,000 people.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 30th Broadcast: As a result of yesterday's search in Palestine, a total of 2,000 Jews were arrested.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 29th]</p>
<p>British military police specifically chose the Jewish Sabbath today, deploying aircraft and tanks on a large scale to arrest 1,000 Jews in various parts of Palestine, opening safes and seizing more than 1,000 documents, conducting lightning inspections, and implementing curfews at night.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 29th]</p>
<p>British troops and Palestinian police suddenly searched the headquarters of the World Jewish Agency and more than ten Jewish areas in Tel Aviv and Haifa simultaneously in a lightning manner, arresting several Jewish leaders. Shertok, the political director of the Jewish Agency, political advisor Joseph, and Fishman were also among those arrested.</p>
<p>Eradicating Terrorist Activities</p>
<p>The British action is said to be part of an overall plan to prevent the Jewish terrorist movement. A statement issued at noon said that the search was proceeding according to plan and had not encountered any resistance. Tel Aviv was still quiet. British engineers used explosives to blow open the Harbor Bank and the Jewish Women's Association building, searching person by person. There was no serious loss after the explosion. In the North Ofer district south of Tel Aviv, three Jews were injured trying to break through the cordon. In the Hasharon district between Tel Aviv and Haifa, 40 Jews were detained. In Rehovot, where the residence of World Jewish Congress President Weizmann is located, Jewish youths piled obstacles on the road, and some people destroyed the transportation blockade. The military surrounded the World Jewish Congress headquarters in the Rehavia district here at night. The troops entered the headquarters at dawn and began to move various documents to await inspection. At the same time, they searched the residence of Fishman, the acting chairman of the executive committee of the Congress, and took Fishman onto a truck. In total, several well-known Jewish leaders were arrested in a few hours.</p>
<p>All Traffic Cut Off</p>
<p>Sir John Shaw, Chief Secretary of the Palestinian government, also announced that all traffic between Palestine and the outside world would be cut off from 4:00 am to 10:00 am. Palestinian High Commissioner Cunningham also broadcast to Jewish residents, stating that the search of the Jewish Agency was due to its involvement in recent terrorist cases, and said that the British government is determined to eradicate terrorist activities, and any illegal actions in the future will be subject to strong sanctions. Today's large-scale search operation was carried out on the order of General Paget, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East, and will be stopped as soon as the goal of controlling terrorist activities is achieved. The door to negotiations is not closed. Haifa was quiet under military alert blockade. The Jewish General Labor Union of Tel Aviv and the residences of some Jewish leaders were also searched.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Another Swindle Due to Failed Speculation: 20 Gold Bars and $10 Million in Promissory Notes Defrauded; Shen Jialin, Manager of Baofeng Gold Firm, Harms Others and Himself; Both People and Stolen Goods Recovered Within a Day and a Night <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Shen Jialin (22 years old, Ningbo native), the manager of Baofeng Gold Firm at 561 Nanjing Road, suffered huge losses due to failed speculation. He then had a bad idea and colluded with employees of the firm to commit fraud. At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday (29th), Shen went to Zhang Zhuju's residence at 14 Lane 520 Ningbo Road, soliciting the sale of five gold bars, stating that the price would be settled according to the market price of 1.978 million yuan. Zhang agreed to deliver the gold bars in the afternoon. Zhang, who had transactions with the same industry in the past, did not suspect him and gave him a promissory note from Yongting Bank (with a face value of 10 million yuan). After Shen obtained the note, he delivered it to Chuanfeng Bank to offset the account. Then, at 2:30 PM, he and his partners Zhou Fuchang and Hong Fei defrauded 20 gold bars from Tongfengyu Gold Firm in Overseas Chinese Building on Central Road in the same way, saying that payment could be made at 5:00 PM. When Zhang Zhuju and Tongfengyu Gold Firm sent personnel to collect the gold bars and cash, they discovered that Baofeng Gold Firm had been emptied. The case was reported to the old Zhabei Branch. With the supervision of Criminal Stock Chief Jiang Shangpei, Police Sergeant Song Shaomei, Police Officer Sha Juemin, and others, they rushed to the gold firm and only arrested apprentice You Fengming. After strict questioning, they arrested Zhou Fuchang and Hong Fei at 8 Xin'erli, North Sichuan Road at 9:00 PM that night. According to the confession, there were three gold bars at Shui Youcai's place at 236 Southern Hotel, Jiujiang Road, and they immediately went to retrieve them. Afterwards, they obtained a clue that Shen had lurked in Luodian. Stock Member Song Shaomei and others rushed to the Luodian Bus Station to wait. At about 6:00 AM the next morning, Shen Jialin was seen arriving, preparing to take a bus back to Shanghai, and was immediately arrested. Two gold bars and 500,000 yuan in cash were found in his pockets. They then went to the home of his uncle Shen Xinkang at 13 North Street, Outer Town of Luodian, and found 11 gold bars, which were transported to Shen Xinkang in Shanghai together. Then they went to the home of Shen You Yao Tingzhou at 8 Qingyuanli, Tangjialong, Suzhou Road, and found two gold bars. It is said that two gold bars have been sold by Zhou Fuchang and others for 4 million yuan, and the 500,000 yuan in cash found on Shen's body is also part of the stolen money. The case, from its occurrence to the arrest of all the criminals, only took a day and a night, which can be said to be rapid.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Because the request to reduce taxes was not approved by the municipal government, the Theater Industry Association of this city unanimously decided to automatically suspend business indefinitely starting today, and movies and spoken drama will also suspend business for one day today to show their response. Mayor Wu believed that such actions not only hindered public image but also caused the public to stand in opposition to the government, which was inappropriate. In order to avoid the expansion of the situation, he specially summoned Zhou Jianxing, the director of the association, to the city government at 9:00 am in the morning and persuaded him on the spot, saying that since he took office, there have been many difficulties, and he has tried his best to solve them. At present, the city government's difficulties are still very serious. I hope the Theater Industry Association will not act rashly and increase the difficulties of the administrative authorities. Mr. Zhou expressed that he was very moved by the mayor's sincere persuasion, but his personal opinion was not enough to represent all members, and he was afraid that he could not fully grasp the development of the situation. Mayor Wu immediately issued a hand-written message, saying: June and July are slow months for tax revenue, and the city government already feels tight even if it collects the entertainment tax at the current rate of 50%. Therefore, it is difficult to approve the reduction of the entertainment tax. I hope you can think about the difficulties of the city government and cooperate. Starting from August, if the tax revenue situation improves, it can be considered first. After Mr. Zhou Jianxing obtained the mayor's hand-written message, he held a general meeting of all members at the Tianchan Stage yesterday afternoon and reported the process of meeting the mayor in detail. At that time, there were many opinions and disputes in the meeting place. As a result, it was unanimously decided that the member theaters would suspend business for one day today and then resume business tomorrow and make a decision later. The spoken drama and film industries no longer needed to suspend business, so they were open as usual today.</p>

<p>[United Press, This City, 30th] Mayor Wu Guozhen met with reporters from the Associated Press today when he left the city government to discuss matters with Food Minister Xu Kan, briefly discussing various issues in Shanghai, saying: The anti-US demonstrations in Shanghai's anti-civil war movement were instigated by the Communist Party and should be held responsible. Regarding the accumulation of small thefts at the docks, the monthly loss of imported goods reaches hundreds of millions of yuan in legal tender, and he is planning prevention methods. The reporter asked about the economic danger of this city as Shanghai's British, Dutch, Swiss, Norwegian and French leaders recently wrote to the mayor, and the mayor replied that he clearly understood this danger and would do his best to overcome it. The reporter asked whether he intended to limit prices. The mayor replied, no, the situation here is not conducive to price limits. He also said that the issue of housing rent is under study, but the remedy will not be adopted until he is confident. He has appointed Chinese and foreign non-commissioned officers to form a committee to study British issues. Importing mobile homes cannot solve the housing problem because their prices are too expensive. For street vendors, it is planned to concentrate them in designated areas so that no vendors are seen on important thoroughfares. Finally, the mayor also confirmed that the National Government had explicitly prohibited civilians from owning jeeps.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Miss Robbie Roxas, daughter of the Philippine President, traveled from the United States aboard the "Lin克斯" [Lin克斯 - likely transliteration] to celebrate Philippine Independence Day on July 4th, arriving in Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday. Those welcoming her at the dock included Luo Changge, Chairman of the Philippine Independence Day Committee in Shanghai; Rosa, the Vice Consul of the American Consulate; Miss Liu Banye of the Municipal Government's Protocol Section, representing Mayor Wu and his wife; Gao Lingbai, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai; and several hundred Filipinos residing here.</p>
<p>Miss Roxas is the only daughter of Philippine President Roxas, whom he loves dearly. She has fine yellow hair, fair skin, is of medium height, and has a slender figure. She wore a white straw hat, a white-based red and green floral silk dress, and coffee-colored open-toed high-heeled leather shoes. Her demeanor was very demure. It is no wonder that Commander 巴生 [Ba Sheng], the US Navy advisor to her father, who came especially from Manila to pick her up, told us in advance that she was a very charming and gentle lady.</p>
<p>Miss Roxas is twenty-four years old. She has a younger brother studying in Manila. Before the war, she went to the United States to study in middle school. After the Pearl Harbor incident, she returned to Manila and then went back to the United States ten months ago. She is currently a junior studying literature at Vassar College. She loves music and has been learning piano since childhood. She started learning the harp in 1937. This is her third time in Shanghai. The first time she came, she was only thirteen years old, and unfortunately, she only stayed for a few days. When asked what she would do after graduation, Miss Roxas said, "I very much hope to help my father do some things."</p>
<p>"Along the way, I was eager to see Shanghai again, but unfortunately, I have to fly to Manila early tomorrow morning. Also, I originally wanted to come to Shanghai to buy some things, but now it's too late." Because Miss Roxas arrived too late, the welcome party planned by the Philippine community at the International Hotel at 3:00 PM had to be canceled. Commander 巴生 hosted a celebratory banquet for her in the evening.</p>
<p>Miss Roxas is returning to Manila specifically to participate in the Independence Day celebrations. After that, she will return to the United States to complete her studies. Accompanying her on the flight to Manila were Philippine Education Minister Mrs. 加利可 [Jia Like] and five others, as well as one large and one small dog. In addition, there were more than two hundred Filipinos returning to the country from the United States aboard the "Lin克斯" [Lin克斯 - likely transliteration].</p>

<p>There are currently 590 isolation beds in the city: 250 in the First and Second Municipal Infectious Disease Hospitals, 150 in the Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital, 100 in Guangci Hospital, and 70 in the Emergency Epidemic Hospital. Except for Guangci Hospital, which still has more than 20 empty beds, all other hospitals and private epidemic hospitals announced yesterday that they were full and unable to accommodate more patients. Therefore, the authorities have notified hospitals that are full not to send any more patients.</p>
<p>Rapid Increase Sought</p>
<p>The Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital admitted more than 40 people who appeared to have cholera yesterday, and three died. Starting today, an epidemic outpatient clinic will be opened. Epidemic patients, regardless of wealth, will be treated free of charge, and medicine will be administered day and night, with treatment available upon arrival. Since the discovery of cholera, the hospital has treated 324 real cholera patients and administered surveillance injections for suspected cholera and acute gastroenteritis to over 2,000 people. Regarding the shortage of hospital beds, the authorities are currently seeking remedies. The Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan has recently donated prefabricated wooden houses, and funds are being requested for their construction. The National Medical College can borrow the Fenglin Qiao Zhongshan Hospital when necessary, and allocate beds, equipment, and medical personnel. It is hoped that 400 more beds can be added in the shortest possible time, but preparations still need to be stepped up and completed quickly.</p>
<p>Epidemic Prevention Symposium</p>
<p>Gu Yuqi, President of Tongde Medical College, convened more than 80 senior students and teachers from the college at 10:00 AM yesterday, and invited Wang Jiansheng, District Head of the Eleventh District, Lian Mingzhong, Deputy District Head, and more than 20 Bao chiefs and Bao officers to hold a district epidemic prevention symposium at the college. First, Director Zhang of the Health Bureau gave a speech, followed by discussions on the implementation of immune injections, banning unsanitary food, and expanding publicity.</p>
<p>The Health Bureau's Epidemic Prevention Brigade departed today in 25 teams, coordinating with the health inspection teams to crack down on unsanitary food items in the cholera-stricken areas.</p>
<p>The Health Testing Laboratory cultivates and tests bacteria, and although it is a holiday, it does not stop. Yesterday, 63 cases were confirmed as true cholera, and 8 were retested, bringing the total to 843.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Zhang Tianshi Brings with Him a "Priceless Treasure": An Imperial Jade Seal Handed Down by Emperor Shizu; Dragon Shape on the Left, Tiger Shape on the Right; Said to Have Many Confirmed Facts of Subduing Demons <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Two years before the War of Resistance, Zhang Tianshi (Enpu), the 63rd generation of the Zhang Tianshi lineage from Mount Longhu in Jiangxi, preached the Dharma at the Shanghai Great World, causing a sensation. After the War of Resistance, this Zhang Tianshi quietly returned to his hometown.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and victory finally came. This Zhang Tianshi, nearly fifty years old, also came to Shanghai again after the victory. This time, it was for the establishment of the Chinese Taoist Association. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai, he visited Mayor Wu and the heads of major Buddhist lay associations and friendly religious members.</p>
<p>The reporter met Tianshi yesterday and talked with him for half an hour. From this Tianshi, I learned something about the general situation of Taoism. He said, "Taoism is based on Lao Tzu's teachings. The highest school is the 'Zhengyi' sect. Below there are the 'Longmen' and 'Quanzhen' sects. The only difference between these sects is that 'Zhengyi' can wear casual clothes, and there is no difference between being at home and being a monk, while 'Longmen' and 'Quanzhen' must keep their hair, wear Taoist robes, and eat pure vegetarian food." The reporter also asked about the origin of Tianshi's title, the situation of Mount Longhu, and whether he had the so-called power to catch demons. He said seriously, "Since the beginning when Emperor Shizu Daolinggong was granted the title of Tianshi, it has been more than two thousand two hundred years to this day. But before Emperor Shizu, our earliest ancestor was actually Zhang Liang, who was nine generations away from Emperor Shizu, making a total of seventy-two generations. Mount Longhu is in Guixi County, about fifty li away from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. It is not high, because the mountain on the left is shaped like a dragon, and the mountain on the right is shaped like a tiger, so it is named that way. As for the saying of catching demons, there are indeed many facts of subduing demons on the mountain, but in today's era of scientific advancement, we really don't need to make a sound. In the end, Taoism is a truth and teaching that is righteous and not evil, beneficial and harmless."</p>
<p>Finally, he also told the reporter: Emperor Shizu passed down many Dharma instruments, books, sutras, and the Tao Te Ching, etc. In addition, there are two priceless treasures, one is the jade seal, and the other is the true sword. This time he came to Shanghai, he brought a jade seal, and in the future, he may hold a disaster-relief ceremony in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The US military authorities in the city are taking strict precautions to prevent accidents from happening. They have strictly ordered US soldiers to act with caution. On days when there are parades, US military personnel are prohibited from going out. Military police have been added to the US military residential areas to prevent any unforeseen circumstances. Yesterday, due to rumors of mass parades, the US military authorities immediately implemented martial law and advised officers and soldiers not to go out unless necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Zhenru and Longhua Telephone Exchanges Officially Open Mid-Month; Shanghai-Hankou Calls Also to be Officially Available <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is actively rectifying the telephones in Hongkou, Zhabei, and the suburbs of the city. Yesterday, according to a responsible person from the bureau, who tempted and coerced [誘逼 - likely a typo in the original article] a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the sub-bureaus currently being set up by the bureau are: (1) the Longhua Sub-Bureau, equipped with 200 automatic telephone numbers; (2) the Zhenru Sub-Bureau, equipped with 50 manual telephone numbers; and the Nanshi Sub-Bureau, which is expanding its capacity by 1,200 telephones. The installation of these equipment and machines has been completed. It was originally scheduled to be completed yesterday and officially opened today, but because the Zhenru factory is still under repair, the Longhua Sub-Bureau is still unaware of the circuits, and the Nanshi Sub-Bureau's equipment needs to be adjusted, the opening date must be postponed slightly. The most difficult thing at the moment is the lack of talent for wiring. The bureau is currently adding a telecommunications training class, specializing in training telecommunications personnel. The first batch of trainees will officially graduate within days and will be assigned to the Zhenru, Longhua, and Nanshi Sub-Bureaus for formal service. The opening of the above three bureaus will be delayed until the 15th of this month, when they can be officially opened. The routes that the bureau is currently planning to expand also include the Pudong Sub-Bureau, with 180 manual telephone numbers, and the Wusong Sub-Bureau, with 50 manual telephone numbers. However, the transportation of materials to the Pudong Sub-Bureau is difficult, and the factory building of the Wusong Sub-Bureau is occupied by a certain unit. Negotiations are currently underway with the garrison command. If the location goes smoothly, it can also be officially opened in mid-August.</p>
<p>Wireless Telephone Opening Time</p>
<p>In addition, in order to facilitate domestic communications, the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau previously installed a wireless radio station in Shanghai. Due to route restrictions, only Chongqing, Taipei, Hankou, Beiping, and Guangzhou were opened. Previously, the call times for each location were: (1) Chongqing, 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, and 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM; (2) Taipei, 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, and 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM; (3) Hankou, 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM; (4) Beiping, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM; (5) Guangzhou, 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Recently, the equipment at this station has been malfunctioning and unable to operate smoothly. It is currently being actively repaired and is expected to be completed within days.</p>
<p>Installation of Long-Distance Radio Station in Hankou</p>
<p>Currently, telephone communication between Shanghai and Hankou is highly anticipated, but because telephone communication between Shanghai and Hankou is not sufficient, calls are very difficult to make. In order to remedy this difficulty, the bureau recently installed a wired telephone between Shanghai and Hankou. The installation has now been completed, and a test call has been made, but the voice was not clear. It is currently being modified and is expected to be officially available in mid-month.</p>

<h3 id="e68">The Chinese Musical Theater Troupe Intensifies Rehearsals for New Play; Going to the United States for Performances in the Fall; Raising Funds for Wartime Orphans <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Chinese Musical Theater Troupe, established with the support of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, will be going abroad after the autumn coolness. Under the leadership of Mr. Avraham Shlonsky, the troupe members have been intensifying rehearsals in recent days. Before going to the United States, they are preparing to rehearse at least four plays—*Ancient Temple Dream*, *Meng Jiangnu*, *Five Planets*, and *Rippling Hearts*, all written and composed by Mr. Avraham Shlonsky. The first two plays have already been performed, and the latter two are new. Each play is filled with the advantages of Italian opera and full of Chinese affection. It can be said that introducing Chinese ancient customs in such a lofty and clear style is a first in diplomatic relations, and it will surely attract the appreciation of most allied personnel. In order to clearly understand the detailed situation inside the troupe, the reporter specially went to "Yituan," the place where they often rehearse, for an interview.</p>
<p>From 9:00 AM to 12:00 noon and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day, these young troupe members are active on the flat roof of the front running field bleachers. When the reporter visited, he saw them each showing their talents, rehearsing attentively under the leadership of Mr. Avraham Shlonsky. Looking at Mr. Avraham Shlonsky's silvery white hair, fluctuating up and down due to the intense work, the reporter naturally could not step forward to disturb him. Miss Yang Rongji, the secretary and general affairs officer of the troupe, introduced the details of the troupe to the reporter. Miss Yang has been an old friend of Mr. Avraham Shlonsky for more than ten years, and this time, she will also go to the United States with the troupe.</p>
<p>Thirty-Five Troupe Members Nationwide</p>
<p>The purpose of the Chinese Musical Theater Troupe is to promote Chinese music and culture. Their mission to the United States this time is to raise funds for wartime orphans. The number of troupe members has been decided to be thirty-five, of which twenty-six are actors, equally divided between men and women, and the others are staff. The troupe's selection of actors is very strict, and academic ability, appearance, physique, and behavior must be examined in all aspects. The most important thing is to understand Chinese dance. Most of the existing troupe members are amateur actors. You Zhenglan is also one of them. They once publicly recruited, and although the number of applicants was very enthusiastic, there were very few who qualified. Now they are continuing their efforts to find more people. The confirmed members include consultant Shen Zhibai (professor of music at Shanghai University), deputy director Chen Chui, choir conductor Huang Yongkun, art director Chi Ning, and several actors such as Wang Yuan.</p>
<p>The funds for the Chinese Musical Theater Troupe are entirely donated by Madame Chiang Kai-shek. The widespread circulation that the funds were allocated by the government is not actually the case. After the victory, when Madame Chiang first came to Shanghai, due to the introduction of Madame Sun Yat-sen, Madame Chiang personally recognized *Meng Jiangnu* at a reception for the Allied forces held by the Wartime Service Corps. She believed that this play was enough to spread Chinese culture, so she generously supported it. Now, under the nurturing of Madame Chiang, this newborn baby will be ready to take its first steps after three more months of training.</p>
<p>Their destination is New York. They have now begun to contact the Melropolier Musie Bearau (this is the largest organization in the American music industry, specializing in renting theaters on its behalf. When Dr. Mei Lanfang stayed in the United States, it was also responsible for contacting the theaters on his behalf). If the performance is successful and the tickets are selling well, they hope to travel around, and the ideal is to tour all of Europe.</p>
<p>Regarding their passports, Miss Yang said: There is absolutely no problem, because of the help of General Manager Deng Shiping (appointed by Madame Chiang). Miss Yang told the reporter: "Mr. Deng's help to us is very great. He is the general manager, but he is also a musician. He is usually approachable and often jokes..."</p>
<p>Wang Yuan Participates in Liaison Dance</p>
<p>While talking about raising funds, Mr. Zheng walked over. He is indeed a talkative person. After Miss Yang introduced him, he said: "Shanghai people are really fabrication experts, and they often like to say things that are supposed to be good in a negative way. The Chinese Musical Theater Troupe is clearly such a glorious organization, with a positive and brilliant future, but some people insist on saying that it is a scam, saying that it is deceiving children and women and selling them to the United States"? Then he pointed to Wang Yuan, who was practicing dancing, and secretly told me, "Wang Yuan's Chinese dance is the most fundamental, but the newspapers insist on promoting her as a hula dance expert!"</p>
<p>Then Mr. Zheng visited him with the greatest optimism about the future of the troupe. He had lived in the United States for a long time, and he knew what Americans liked. A troupe that is so well-prepared and so strong is only destined for success, not failure.</p>
<p>At this time, the air raid siren went off, and the rehearsal of *Five Planets* could come to an end. The reporter quickly grabbed Mr. Avraham Shlonsky and had a brief conversation. I learned that Mr. Avraham Shlonsky is exactly fifty years old this year. Thirty years ago, he left his home country - the Soviet Union - and came to China to study ancient Chinese music. He is familiar with Chinese customs and likes to eat Chinese food. He said that he would also like to become a Chinese citizen. After this trip to the United States, he will still return to China because he wants to continue this work. He regards this work as his lifelong career.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Relief for Northern Jiangsu Refugees: Wang Jinshan's Painting Exhibition Opens Today for Seven Days <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Professor Wang Jinshan's painting exhibition to benefit the Northern Jiangsu refugees held a preview yesterday afternoon at Nantong College. Having received an invitation in advance, the reporter, eager to "see it first," was guided by Professor Wang and spent a full hour observing the scene:</p>
<p>Professor Wang's artistic style inherits the orthodox brushwork of the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties. It seems that his paintings reveal him as a multifaceted artist, including landscapes, figures, birds and animals, and flowers. Among these, the Buddhist images in the figure category are the essence of all his works!</p>
<p>Entering the right corner of the painting exhibition, a painting numbered 50, featuring a bare-chested, handsome man with a beautiful beard in plain clothes, holding a cattail fan, exuded an unrestrained and joyful spirit. His old face was full of smiles—the laughter of victory. Professor Wang said that when the news of the initial victories of the previous year's war spread, he was</p>
<p>reminded of Du Fu's poem: "In broad daylight, we must sing and freely drink wine; in youthful company, we can still return to our villages." The depressed mood of many years suddenly blossomed, and thus this exquisite work was completed.</p>
<p>The reporter also enjoyed many "Luohan" portrait works, each with its own expression and style. When seeing the large portrait of "The Venerable Damo" numbered 88, one saw a powerful and forceful brushwork. The colors were elegant; the vermilion robe subtly set off Damo's robust body, giving one a sense of boundless vigor. However, the adjacent painting of "White Lotus," a white flower, gave one a feeling of purity and serenity!</p>
<p>The painting "Reed Geese" numbered 66 is composed of four screen panels. The goose flock on the painting each have a distinctive appearance. The brushstrokes of the two clumps of sugar cane leaves and the sugar cane stalks appear strong and powerful! After seeing this painting, it seems as if one is in the desolate autumn scene, strolling along the desolate reed bank!</p>
<p>The large painting numbered 13, "Displaced People," was displayed before the reporter. The painting is adorned with two or three ancient-dressed, elderly and weak refugees, supporting the old and leading the young, holding crutches, carrying baggage, wandering around aimlessly. In the distance, a corner of the ancient city wall is faintly visible. However, the refugees face a vast, uncertain future, unable to find a home! Professor Wang inscribed on the painting: "Returning east in May of the thirty-fifth year, the Northern Jiangsu region is unstable, the refugees are displaced, and I, too, have no home to return to. I write this painting to express my sentiments." This painting fully symbolizes the current tragic situation in Northern Jiangsu. Although priced at two million yuan, I believe that those who care about the Northern Jiangsu refugees will not hesitate to spend money to compete for it.</p>
<p>In addition, the painting numbered 25, "Small Island," and the painting numbered 45, "Rural Flavor," although painted with simple brushstrokes, give one a lasting impression. The painting numbered 61, "The Venerable Samantabhadra," is a brushwork in the style of the late Tang Dynasty. The painting numbered 20, "Sounds of Pines and Plum Blossoms," with verdant pines and white plum blossoms complementing each other, is also a rare work.</p>
<p>When the reporter stepped into the painting room, it was extremely hot outside, inevitably causing one to sweat profusely. However, after enjoying an hour of "ice-cold" art, the heat wave had unknowingly disappeared.</p>
<p>Professor Wang is a multifaceted artist. He has been teaching at the Central Political School for five years. In his spare time, in addition to painting, he has also written plays such as "Tuberose," "Willow Lantern Transformation," "Double Swallow Building," "Fisherman, Woodcutter, and Reader," and "Sun and Moon Competing for Glory." In addition, he has also served as a director, written "Mountain and Tang Sketches," and edited publications such as "Literary Monthly" and "Literary Vanguard." The current painting exhibition is just one aspect of his versatile talent.</p>
<p>Professor Wang's paintings will be on public exhibition from today until the 7th, from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily, at Nantong College on Chongqing North Road and Weihaiwei Road. During yesterday's preview, the reporter discovered that many exquisite pieces had already been purchased. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who care about the Northern Jiangsu refugees and the arts will go and appreciate them! (Cang Long)</p>

Various parties are now inclined to favor Luo Qinghua. It is highly likely that Mr. Luo will be elected chairman in today's first board of directors and supervisors meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Proposed Amendments to the Banking Law Attract Close Attention from the Financial Sector; Zhu Sihuang Expresses Opinions on the Draft <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's proposed amendments to the Banking Law, which are currently being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan, have attracted close attention from the financial sector. To clarify the contents, the reporter specifically interviewed Zhu Sihuang, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, who revealed the following key points: (1) Article 3 of the draft states that the minimum capital for a bank organized as a limited liability company is 2 million yuan. It is said that this amount is based on the standard after currency stabilization. If so, it is not applicable at present, and the legislation should be realistic. The capital amount is difficult for the public to understand. (2) Regarding the deposit reserve requirement, Zhu believes that according to the draft provisions, the reserve requirement for current deposits can be as high as 20% and the reserve requirement for time deposits can be as high as 15%, to be deposited with the Central Bank. According to this ratio, if it is a truly liquid reserve, there is no problem. However, the so-called reserve is actually a stagnant guarantee. In addition, the bank itself needs to maintain a considerable amount of cash and clearing balances, about 40%. The deposits that the bank can use are only about 30% or 40%. How can the bank's capital position be flexible? (3) The restrictions on business operations seem too strict. For example, loans to the industrial and mining industries are limited to no less than 20%, otherwise, they will be penalized. On this point, the Central Bank has a large amount of deposits on hand, and may not have suitable industrial and mining loan targets for a while. Also, what if there is a large-scale recovery of industrial and mining loans? Wouldn't this be treated the same? (4) Furthermore, restricting banks from being shareholders of other companies and allowing banks to trade in securities seems contradictory in fact. (5) Mortgage loans on immovable property must not exceed 10% of the bank's paid-in capital surplus. Although the amount is small, most factories currently rely on factory buildings and land as collateral for financing. Although this provision is reasonable in principle, does it meet the needs of the superior and inferior in the Chinese industrial and commercial environment? (6) The provision of limited liability for banks and joint liability for shareholders is not only practically impossible, but also does not help to protect depositors' interests. Zhu concluded by saying that although the provisions for foreign banks were not in the old Banking Law, these provisions are of course suitable for the environment. However, foreign banks have a full range of business operations, such as deposits, discounts, and international remittances. Unfortunately, there are many obstacles to the business operations of Chinese banks.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Ministry of Education Recently Adjusted the National Water Conservancy Education Institutions; Central Facilities to be Developed Separately in the Southeast, Northwest, and Other Regions <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>[Special report from Chongqing] Based on the resolution of the Tenth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang to train a large number of water conservancy talents, the Ministry of Education formulated measures, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, to establish secondary water conservancy departments. It designated the National Yellow River Basin Water Conservancy Engineering Vocational School, which had relatively complete equipment, the Shaanxi Provincial Sanyuan Industrial and Vocational School, the Water Conservancy Department Vocational School attached to the Qijiang Dao Huai Committee, and the private Nanchong Yucai Senior Vocational School as four units to handle the matter, reaching 24 classes. In addition, the Ministry of Education designated the Private Yizhi Agricultural Vocational School in Shaanxi, named after the water conservancy master Li Yizhi, to run three classes in farmland water conservancy. However, these water conservancy education institutions were all concentrated in the rear. Recently, a special adjustment has been made: the Water Conservancy Department Vocational School of the Dao Huai Committee was moved to Jinshan, Jiangnan, Jiangsu; and a branch school was set up in Huaibei, Anhui, which will be the central facility for secondary water conservancy education in eastern China. Nanchong Yucai Vocational School remains in Nanchong, Sichuan, as the central facility for water conservancy education in western China. Sanyuan Industrial and Vocational School remains in Sanyuan, Shaanxi, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Vocational School returns from Jiji, Shaanxi, to Kaifeng, Henan, together with the farmland water conservancy department of the Private Yizhi Agricultural Vocational School in Shaanxi. These three schools are the central facilities for Yongli education in northern China. The southern region also urgently needs this type of talent, but this department is still lacking. It has been specially designated that the Guangdong Provincial Guangzhou Senior Industrial Vocational School add this department. Two classes will be opened this year. The Ministry of Education will allocate funds for construction and regular expenses, limited to enrollment and classes this summer, and then increase by two classes each year to reach six classes, in order to establish a central facility for secondary water conservancy education in southern China and plan to promote national water conservancy construction. Ningxia Province also urgently needs farmland water conservancy talents, and it has also been decided to add a farmland water conservancy department in the province this year. (An)</p>

<p>Publicly Funded Exam Starts July 21; Privately Funded Exam Around July 28</p>
<p>[Special report from Yujing] The regulations for publicly and privately funded students studying abroad this year were announced on June 29 by the examination committee office of the Ministry of Education: Those who have passed the higher civil service examination and have served for more than two years are also eligible to participate in the publicly and privately funded study abroad examination. Therefore, those who have passed the higher examination and meet this requirement also registered for the exam. Because the deadline was the end of June, a five-day extension was granted for those from remote areas, with the registration deadline being July 5. Due to the short deadline, the registration office at the Ministry of Education was full every day. It is reported that there are now over 600 registrants. It is heard that the publicly funded exam is scheduled to start on July 21, and the privately funded exam will be held after the 26th, around July 28. It is also heard that the Ministry of Education will re-adjust the study abroad measures for the next year. The publicly funded students will of course be strictly examined. Whether the privately funded students studying abroad will be given more leniency with reference to the situation before the war, or whether they will still be examined in the same way as publicly funded students, will depend on the future needs and construction of talents, and appropriate adaptation will determine the measures.

<h3 id="e96">Yuchang Loans Against Warehouse Receipts from Before the War Are Not Repayments of Recovered Spoils; Three Associations Still Trying to Negotiate <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Reports in various newspapers in recent days have mentioned that the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau is returning a portion of enemy-seized cotton cloth. This reporter has inquired with relevant parties and learned that the portion of cotton cloth returned by the Disposal Bureau is actually from warehouse receipts issued by the British Yuchang Factory before the outbreak of the Pacific War, for goods that the holders did not have time to pick up. It is not surplus cotton cloth purchased by the enemy or puppet regimes. As for the surplus cotton cloth that the dyeing and weaving, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn associations have requested to be returned, their previous appeal to the National Business Receiving Committee in the Recovered Areas of the Executive Yuan has been rejected. They have been informed that the committee has been ordered to disband and cannot accept appeals. Therefore, the dyeing and weaving association and others have filed an administrative lawsuit with the Administrative Court. At the same time, they telegraphed the National Political Council to urge the Executive Yuan to promptly return the cloth. A summary of their telegram to the Political Council states that in the case of the forced purchase of cotton cloth, both the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Commerce have upheld justice and made resolutions to request the government to investigate and return it. However, the review committee of the Bureau, first believing that the cotton cloth may have been moved or sold, making it impossible to investigate, and then believing that the enemy and puppet regimes offered favorable terms for the purchase of cotton cloth, so merchants suffered little loss, displayed a biased view that recognized the enemy's benevolence. For over half a year, no progress has been made. Last month, the committee even resolved to treat the seized cotton cloth as government materials and hand it over to the Textile Construction Corporation for bidding. This has caused great indignation and a strike protest. The committee does not consider that all materials owned by merchants were forcibly seized by the enemy and puppet regimes. Although they gave a price, it was essentially robbery. How can there be any thinness to speak of? Victims were angry but dared not speak out under the high pressure of violence at the time. Today, they are crying out in pain and only ask for the pursuit of the thieves. Unexpectedly, the administrator instead takes the thief's actions as benevolent, and puts the thief's loot in the warehouse. This is not reasonable in any way in terms of law or reason. The association bears the responsibility of correcting the enemy's seizure of property and maintaining post-war popular sentiment. The so-called favorable purchase method is indeed difficult to understand, and the so-called transfer of goods is not the merchant's responsibility. These words not only make it difficult for the industry to willingly comply, but also make the people disappointed and disheartened. Recently, the Bureau has been retrieving and auctioning cotton cloth that was ordered to be kept by the victims of the former puppet merchant associations, causing increasing anxiety among the people. In addition to writing to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, it is appropriate to telegraph to request that the original resolution of the previous conference be reviewed and that the Executive Yuan be urged to promptly order the return in order to maintain public hope and demonstrate relief.</p>

<p>[United Press, June 29] The Guangzhou Daily reported today that although foreign exchange can be formally applied for from June 1st, the actual number of applicants is not very large, because most importers are ordering goods from the United States through Hong Kong.

Guangzhou's export trade includes tung oil, leaf vegetables, and banana fans. Although the prices of these goods are high, the sales channels are still smooth.</p>

Last week, the Taikoo Company's Niuzhuang ship transported a large quantity of cotton cloth to Guangzhou, as reported previously. It is now known that today the China Merchants Bureau's Haihan ship sailed directly to Shantou, carrying 940 pieces of cotton yarn, over 120 bolts of cloth, over 21,300 blocks of bean curd, over 3,880 bags of soybeans, and 2,000 bags of wheat. In addition, the Yankai ship is scheduled to sail to Guangdong on the 3rd, also carrying a large quantity of cotton cloth. There are bookings for over 3,200 pieces of cotton yarn and over 3,810 bolts of cloth, of which over 450 pieces are being shipped by the China Textile Corporation.</p>

<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, June 29] Guangzhou rice prices have fallen sharply in recent days, and the food crisis has passed. The cost of living has also generally fallen by 20 percent as a result. The current rice price is close to what it was two months ago, with the best rice selling for about 45,000 yuan per shi. It is understood that rice transported from Jiangxi and Fujian is about to arrive, and the supply of rice is expected to be sufficient. The prices of firewood, sugar, and flour have also decreased significantly. Canned meat from Australia will also be arriving.</p>
<h3 id="e102">National Commercial Banks' Deposits Reach 200 Billion; This City Accounts for Slightly Less Than Half <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>According to news from the Central Bank's Examiners Office, the amount of deposits in commercial banks and money houses in various places across the country in June has increased compared to May. Statistics show that the national total is about 200 billion yuan, an increase of about 20 billion yuan compared to May. In Shanghai, the total is 90 billion yuan, an increase of about 10 billion yuan compared to May. Based on the above figures, deposits in Shanghai's banking and money industry account for 45 percent of the national total.</p>
<p>The end-of-June settlement period for Shanghai's banking and money industry has passed safely. Today, the bankers' holiday, is a traditional holiday. According to news from financial circles yesterday, the business of commercial banks and money houses in June was quite developed, with deposits reaching 90 billion yuan, an increase of about 10 billion yuan compared to May, accounting for 45 percent of the national total of bank and money house deposits (according to June's total national deposits being 200 billion yuan). It is expected that the second half of the year will be even more normal. The relevant information is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>In order to stabilize finance, the Central Bank's deposit reserve ratio paid by various commercial banks and money houses reached over 18 billion yuan in June due to the sharp increase in deposits, an increase of approximately 2 billion yuan compared to May.</p>
<p>Regarding the business of commercial banks and money houses, in addition to deposit transactions, remittances are an important part. However, at present, because transportation has not been restored in some areas and there are very few branches set up by various banks, which has resulted in the inability to transfer funds, the obligations of various banks have been significantly affected. In addition, interbank lending is difficult to develop due to high interest rates.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Taiwan Sugar Corporation Assistant Manager Talks About Sugar Corporation's Marketing and Production Situation <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Recently, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation has often been involved in sugar issues. The public is largely unaware of the company's sales organization, supply information, and other details. Yesterday, this reporter specifically visited Song Yixin, the assistant manager and business manager of the company, who provided a detailed account. According to him, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation was officially established on May 1st of this year, jointly organized by the Executive Yuan and the Taiwan Chief Executive's Office. Claims of a joint public-private venture are inaccurate. The takeover process occurred around October of last year, when the Resources Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs took over 42 sugar factories in Taiwan and four companies organized by the Japanese, including 50,000 tons of stored sugar and other farms. Later, the Resources Committee was placed under the Executive Yuan, so the Taiwan sugar factories were also transferred to the Executive Yuan. After discussions between the Executive Yuan and the Taiwan Chief Executive's Office, it was decided that the two institutions would jointly form the company.</p>
<p>Regarding the high sugar prices, Mr. Song stated that this was due to transportation difficulties, as although there were ships available, they could not transport large quantities of Taiwan sugar. However, the reason for the transportation difficulties was due to other government measures, which the company could not investigate. In reality, the company did not have much inventory. It is estimated that Shanghai currently needs about 10,000 tons of sugar per month (70% of which is sold to other locations). If transportation becomes smoother in the future, the demand will likely exceed this amount.</p>
<p>Regarding sugar production in Taiwan, Mr. Song stated that during the Japanese occupation, Taiwanese farmers were forced to grow sugarcane, and annual sugar production could reach 1.4 million tons. However, the current situation is very different. Most farmers have abandoned sugarcane because they can make more profit from growing rice. From planting to harvesting, sugarcane requires 18 months. From the takeover to April of this year, a total of 90,000 tons of sugar were produced. The company plans to produce 300,000 to 500,000 tons of sugar annually in the future, but this will only be achievable in two or three years. Currently, the 42 factories have only 12,000 workers and over 1,000 staff members.</p>
<p>The company's general manager, Shen Zhennan, went to Taiwan to encourage farmers to grow sugarcane, inspect factory operations, and oversee the affairs of the four companies. He will return to Shanghai soon to discuss and decide on plans for the development of the sugar industry. If transportation issues are resolved in the future, it is planned to establish branches in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangdong. The Taipei office has already been established. The company's capital has not yet been calculated, and expenses are temporarily covered by overdrafts from the Central Bank and the Bank of Taiwan.</p>

<p>The Xinhe Yarn Factory held a shareholder meeting yesterday. The original capital of 150 million yuan in puppet currency was converted to legal tender. A dividend of 26 yuan was paid from the profits of the 35th year, with 20 yuan used to increase the capital of old shares. An interest of 4 yuan was also issued for the 34th year. (The capital was increased to 450 million yuan in legal tender, with two new shares issued for each old share, and an additional 10 yuan in interest.)</p>

<p>Dried Shrimp Tails: A large shipment of Hong Kong Golden Hook tails, about 200 boxes, is expected to arrive soon and be available immediately, which has negatively impacted other dried shrimp tail vendors. Most vendors in this area are taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>Longkou Vermicelli: Since the Cantonese brokers started operating, the momentum has been unstoppable. Xianggu starch is also strong, followed by wood ear and lotus seeds. Other goods are also rising steadily.</p>
<p>Bricks and Tiles: The supply of tiles and lime was scarce yesterday due to several days of strong tides, which prevented shipping. Sales in Shanghai have increased sharply, and market prices have risen. However, cement prices remain stable.</p>

<p>According to sources at the Minsheng Industrial Company, after General Manager Lu Zuofu returned to China, he plans to implement a partial restructuring of the company and will seek to expand the scope of operations of various departments.</p>
<p>The Highway Transportation Team of the Good Rescue Headquarters previously rented out trucks ranging from two to ten tons at lower prices than other transportation companies. As the trucks were newly arrived and traveled quickly, many people rented them. However, due to multiple intermediaries, there was a "black market." After learning of this, the General Headquarters ordered the team to stop renting and to reorganize personnel, resulting in the suspension of five people.</p>
<p>A large number of enemy and puppet ships and cars seized by the Enemy Property Bureau, except for those belonging to Allied personnel and legitimate Chinese owners, have been returned. The remaining confiscated enemy and puppet cars have been auctioned off twice, and the ships have been auctioned off once in cooperation with the China Merchants Bureau. Recently, more auctions will be announced publicly in newspapers.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Match Raw Materials and the Electrochemical Industry <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>—Zhang Bo'an</p>
<p>The main raw materials for matches are "potassium chlorate" and "red phosphorus." The production of both "potassium chlorate" and "red phosphorus" requires electrolysis, so match raw materials and the electrochemical industry are inseparable.</p>
<p>Before the war, all of China's match raw materials were imported, such as English "white medicine" (i.e., potassium chlorate) and German "Iliadton" "red phosphorus." In the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, match factories competed to import raw materials, making match raw materials and pigments hot commodities for a time. Later, due to the European war, the supply was cut off. Inland matches not only became a target for speculators, but also became scarce at times. Even now, inland areas still use paper match heads because of this.</p>
<p>Around the 30th year of the Republic (1941), many electrochemical plants were established in the inland areas. First, the Southeast Chemical Plant produced white medicine, followed by a large-scale manufacturing operation by a major electrical and chemical plant in Quanzhou. In Min Province and Nanping, factories were also built. Later, phosphorus manufacturing factories appeared, but they were on a much smaller scale and were not as widespread as potassium chlorate.</p>
<p>Although the engineering of potassium chlorate (K+Cl) is complex, the extreme shortage of special materials during the war, coupled with a lack of work experience, made initial difficulties unavoidable. The Yongjia Southeast Chemical Plant used 60 K.Q. of DC to electrolyze salt, with the goal of balancing the main and by-products. Initially, the Danzeng Deshi electrolytic cell was used for electrolysis, resulting in very little chlorine gas. The carbon rods in the battery were thick and few, which was the same problem encountered by the Shanghai Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant in its early electrolysis operations. Later, honeycomb-shaped anode carbon rods were used, which increased the output of chlorine gas. The operations of the Quanzhou Electrochemical Plant are not well understood, but the electrolysis of salt in Min Province was quite innovative. The Electrochemical Plant of the Nanping Fujian Enterprise Company used an 18KW DC motor, using goldfish glass tanks as batteries. The total current was supplied to more than 200 goldfish tank electrolysis cells, producing 18 batches of potassium chlorate per month (each batch weighing 100 market pounds). Its operating procedure was as follows:</p>
<p>First, the Tong alkali potassium solution is mixed with salt and placed in an open electrolytic cell for electrolysis. In theory, salt and potassium, after electrolysis with water, produce potassium hypochlorite. At this time, sodium carbonate and potassium hypochlorite are converted to potassium chlorate after oxidation, and carbonic acid can also be sold as an industrial raw material. If it is converted to caustic soda, it can be obtained by boiling it with lime. This is a simple and highly efficient operating method in industry.</p>
<p>There is also a clever method of combining Tong alkali and salt, using large water tanks as electrochemical cells. After the salt is mixed with water, it is placed in the tank, and a 220W AC current is passed between the interconnected copper diagrams between the tanks. After four hours of electrolysis, the liquid caustic soda is generated, which can be directly used for soap making. There is also 20% potassium chloride, which can be made into potassium chlorate after further electrolysis.</p>
<p>The manufacturing of chlorine-substituted sodium in the inland areas can also be solved by electrochemistry, but the electrical power in large cities in the inland areas is generally very limited, and there is little spare capacity to supply industrial electricity. Therefore, inland phosphorus factories use sulfuric acid to decompose bones to make phosphorus.</p>
<p>Animal bones are dry-distilled in the absence of oxygen to produce bone charcoal powder. The bones are decomposed with hydrochloric acid to form calcium phosphate, which is then reduced with charcoal and distilled to obtain red phosphorus. Redistillation yields "red phosphorus."</p>
<p>China has abundant coastal salt fields. In the future, the electrochemical industry in China is bound to use local salt for electrolysis, so that match raw materials will no longer need to be imported. Animal bones are also a waste product. If used to make phosphorus, their value will be greatly increased.</p>

<p>—Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>New York, 10th (via airmail to this newspaper)</p>
<p>The Democratic government has been in power in the United States for fourteen consecutive years. The first five years can be described as Roosevelt's "economic revival period." At that time, the global economy was in recession, and American capitalism was on the verge of total collapse. Many American friends still "turn pale at the mention of" the economic panic of 1929. It is said that banks on Wall Street closed, and Broadway in New York was full of "beggars." Many people had no place to eat or sleep, and at night they would stay in the subway cars. The subway trains would run from one end to the other, and then back again. Many people would doze off and spend the night there. In winter, the subway trains had heating, which was much more comfortable than being an "inspector on the cold streets."</p>
<h3 id="e110">Workers' Arrogance and Laziness Are a Product of War <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>I heard an old Chinese student in New York talk about the story of 1929. He said, "It was interesting to be a student at that time. Although we were not rich at the time, our lives seemed like a paradise in the dreams of those unemployed workers. At that time, I could hire workers to clean my house for the lowest wages. Later, I hired a servant who didn't want any wages at all. His condition was just that he be allowed to roll up a blanket and sleep outside my door at night."</p>
<p>He said that at that time, an American worker who delivered food to him didn't want any wages either. Every night, he would come to collect a nickel (five cents). He would take the nickel and jump on the subway, and that's how he would "spend" the night.</p>
<p>But times have changed. Today's American workers not only no longer care about that nickel, but they also don't want to do normal work. The endless stream of strikes is certainly due to local economic imbalances, but the war has spoiled their arrogance and laziness. Their remaining salaries are still enough for them to live a carefree life for a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>In New York, the most difficult thing now is to find housing. Many veterans have returned. They were originally workers in steel mills and cement factories. After serving in the military for a few years, they want to retire to New York. Many G.I.s have now started families in New York, so the housing shortage is naturally getting worse and worse, and the productivity of factories cannot be balanced.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Government Uses Pressure as a Last Resort <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>According to the highest principles of American political thought, the less power the government has, the better, and the fewer things the government manages, the better. In the United States, the term "state-owned enterprises" is rarely heard. All industrial and commercial enterprises are privately owned. However, when privately owned enterprises have problems or affect national interests, the government has a responsibility to step in and take over. For example, when President Roosevelt was in office, due to the war, many automobile factories were converted to making airplanes, and many light and heavy industries were converted to military and armaments industries. Some were subsidized by the government to increase production, and some were taken over entirely by the government. However, as soon as the war ended, Congress passed the so-called "Industrial Restoration Act" and returned them to private entrepreneurs. President Truman's principle for dealing with labor unrest was still "the less government power, the better," until he had no choice but to order the government to temporarily take over. On the day Truman ordered the takeover of the railroads, because he was in a hurry to go to William Jewell College in Missouri to receive an honorary doctorate, he asked the workers to postpone the strike for five days and hinted to Witt, the leader of the drivers' union, that he could accept the workers' demands. This eased the labor unrest that was about to erupt. However, after President Truman, wearing his doctoral cap, returned to the White House, he did not fulfill his "hint." Therefore, Witt called him "the most shameless liar."</p>
<p>Time magazine described the inside story of the White House talks in a very relaxed way. It said that on the first day Truman returned to Washington from Missouri, he summoned Johnston, the leader of the railroad workers, and Witt, the leader of the drivers' union. President Truman first gave a long speech, very humble and polite. Johnston always said, "Yes, Mr. President," "Yes, Mr. President." But this Mr. Witt had no expression at all, looking at the ceiling with his face tilted, looking nonchalant and contemptuous. The magazine's reporter commented that Witt had only received two years of primary school education and was a "rank-and-file" member of the railroad workers.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The President Handles Affairs With Calm and Objectivity <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Truman has had decades of experience in Congress in American politics. His cultivation and integrity are, as described by a New York Daily News reporter, a typical American new-style gentleman. He handles many chaotic public affairs with a calm and objective manner, without being impatient or disorganized. However, in any case, he is a typical "peaceful prime minister," unable to be as "ambitious" as Roosevelt. Roosevelt sometimes used swift and decisive measures, such as ordering Wall Street banks to close in 1934. Sometimes, he could be very circuitous and indirect, making people sincerely convinced. Roosevelt's struggle with the isolationists was like this. Secondly, Roosevelt was much stronger than Truman in controlling the Democratic Party internally. Truman's recent "Anti-Strike Act" is an example.</p>
<p>The "Anti-Strike Act" was proposed to Congress by President Truman. It was after the railroad labor unrest had subsided and before the coal mine labor unrest had been resolved. According to Truman himself, he saw that the workers' frantic strikes would harm American social welfare and damage the economic lifeline of the United States. Therefore, while amending the labor law, he also proposed this "Anti-Strike Act" in parallel. It stated that "any enterprise that has been declared taken over by the government, workers must not unreasonably demand a strike, otherwise, the government can force the striking workers to serve in the military."</p>
<p>The day after this bill was announced and discussed, I paid attention to the public opinion in Washington and New York, and most of it was severely critical. The left-leaning New York Post published a huge cartoon saying that Truman was the incarnation of a fascist warlord. Its editorial said that Truman's bill would strangle the lives of American workers and was tantamount to being an enemy of all labor. The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune also said that the president's bill was excessive. Only the New York Daily News, which was considered yellow journalism but was actually right-leaning and had very subtle propaganda techniques, wrote an editorial called "Harry, Keep Going!" (Note: Harry is President Truman's nickname.)</p>
<h3 id="e113">Quick Eyes and Hands Also Require the Use of魄力 <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The day after the Anti-Strike Act was voted on, President Truman held a press conference at the White House. Someone talked about this matter, and the president's expression was very sincere. He started from the democratic foundation of the United States and then talked about the incompatibility of individual freedom and social welfare. He said, "I am the chief executive of the United States. Which path should I choose? Of course, social welfare is more important." Therefore, "I am determined to continue to fight a death struggle with unlimited personal freedom."</p>
<p>Some Americans ridiculed him behind his back, saying, "Where is social welfare? It's just to benefit the capitalists!"</p>
<p>This is one point of view. Another view, I think, is very unique. It was a congressional staffer who said to me! "The president would never be so stupid as to propose such an emergency bill that is bound to fail. The reason why the president did this is entirely a threat to the striking workers, indicating that he has a magic weapon in case of last resort."</p>
<p>At that time, the coal mine labor unrest was still being negotiated between Krug (Secretary of the Interior and Director of Government Takeover of Coal Mines) and Lewis. Shortly after the bill was announced, the labor unrest was resolved. I remembered that the resolution of the railroad labor unrest was entirely due to the threat of the army driving the trains. I remember when I was in London, someone said to me, "Don't look at Truman's mediocre appearance. He used the atomic bomb to bomb Japan and the "Lend-Lease Act" to bomb Britain. He's not mediocre at all!"</p>
<p>Any politician, especially the chief executive of a large country, must use a little "魄力" (Po-Li, boldness and resoluteness). A person with 魄力 must be "eye-sharp and hand-fast." If the hand is not fast and the eye is not sharp, one cannot be a chief executive for long. Therefore, the poet Li Houzhu wanted to destroy the country when he became emperor, and the romantic King Edward VIII would rather abdicate and become the Duke of Windsor. Scholar-President Wilson was about to vomit blood and die.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Economic Imbalances Is the System Undergoing Change? <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the current American economic imbalances, the problem is not the ability and means of President Truman, but whether there will be any changes in the American economic system?</p>
<p>The left wing of the Democratic Party advocates "national socialism." Wallace is one such view. He believes that today's American domestic and foreign problems have not grasped this major policy. If capitalism continues to exist, the domestic economic crisis cannot be fundamentally resolved, and diplomacy with the Soviet Union will inevitably go further and further. However, I have never seen or heard about Wallace's specific proposals and implementation methods for "national socialism."</p>
<p>The New York Post has published several special articles on the resolution of labor unrest. It argues that in order to completely resolve the ups and downs of labor unrest, the government should not take over, but should buy out the entire industry. The Post advocates taking advantage of the fact that capital is unwilling to continue operating to make a national, once-and-for-all plan, first buying out coal mines and even railroads.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Union Movements Affect Presidential Elections <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>In China, talking about state-owned coal mines or state-owned railroads does not seem strange. In the United States, such arguments are indeed "ear-piercing." Many Americans believe that state-owned enterprises will destroy the enterprises themselves, and at the same time, state ownership will increase the power of the government and destroy the constitutional order and individual freedom. An American railroad union leader told me that union organizations can remedy the shortcomings of private enterprises, because as soon as a union is strong, it can balance and limit the psychology of unlimited profit seeking. He broke down many principles of balance, which is very similar to the "cooperative system" that is widely promoted in China.</p>
<p>He cited the example of the United Railroad Workers and Road Workers Union, which led the strike this time. Their union was founded in the 19th century. In 1877, when the United States was still in the early stages of capitalism, there was a major railroad workers' strike. These "desperate" workers set fire to the military station in the steel city of Pittsburgh. After the labor unrest subsided, the union was strengthened. After seventy years, the union includes members throughout the country's railroad workers. The union's funds and property are calculated in units of "billions." The movements of the union can affect the elections of each president. The union can even allocate a portion of the funds to support the election activities of a certain party or person. He said, "Although capitalists have money, unions also have money." He said, "American workers and capitalists are equal, and they are not afraid of each other." After listening to his words and thinking about Witt's "Declaration Against Du," I can't help but construct a vision of the 1948 election.</p>

<p>Luoyang, 20th (via this newspaper)</p>
<p>Walking in hot weather is the most painful thing, especially in the north, where there are few trees and barren land. There is simply no way to escape the shackles of heat.</p>
<p>In order to visit the American tractor farms in the Yellow River Flood Area, the reporter especially came to Kaifeng from Luoyang. Although it was only more than 400 li on the road, it took a day and a half on the train. Fortunately, it did not derail, and there was no waiting for the train. It arrived on time, which is considered a rare event. But the suffering on the road still requires you to endure more than a dozen hours yourself, which may be unimaginable to other stations. It definitely doesn't exist on the Beijing-Shanghai line.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Difficulty in Waiting for the Train - Forming a Long Snake Line <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>First, let me note the difficulty of waiting for the train. The express train heading east departs at 8:00 AM every day, and tickets for third-class passengers are sold at 7:00 AM. Ticket sales require forming a long snake line, divided into two major lines for military personnel and civilians. Because there are too many passengers, often before dawn, the line for buying tickets is already formed in front of the ticket office, fearing that they will not be able to buy a ticket and board the train, or be fined double the fare for the entire journey. The most feared thing is having to wait another day at the station and stay another night or two in a hotel, with that unsettling feeling in their hearts. Those who have traveled long distances will understand this feeling.</p>
<p>After purchasing a ticket, passengers can freely board the train and find a seat. Third-class cars are not managed by anyone. They are old, stuffy freight cars with a few long benches with backrests added. Apart from the two large doors exchanging air flow, there are no air vents or windows to regulate the air inside. The chaotic and crowded situation can be imagined.</p>
<p>First and second-class tickets are bought the afternoon before, with assigned seating each time. However, sometimes due to train scheduling issues, the ticket sales and seating arrangements differ greatly. This inevitably leads to disorder in the car, with the strong preying on the weak. Those who bought tickets often become standing passengers in first and second-class cars.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Gansu Province Launches Five-Year Plan - Formulates Four Core Tasks for the First Phase <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Bingzi</p>
<p>Our Newspaper Lanzhou, 22nd by airmail</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang recently telegraphed orders to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces to particularly strengthen the suppression of opium and other narcotics. Opium offenders will still be handed over to military courts to be dealt with in accordance with the regulations on suppressing opium and narcotics, with a deadline of one year.</p>
<p>The first phase of core tasks in Gansu Province's five-year construction plan is divided into four areas: (1) Establishing a national construction ethos, (2) Laying the foundation for economic construction, (3) Actively eliminating illiteracy, (4) Promoting local autonomy. The provincial government committee has approved its implementation.</p>
<p>In order to prevent corruption in disaster relief, the provincial government has specially sent Yang Jiying, Director of the Department of Social Affairs, to Dingxi, Lintao, and other twelve counties to supervise the distribution of drought relief funds. Mr. Yang departed on the 17th.</p>
<p>The provincial government previously requested US$300,000 in foreign exchange from the central government to carry out the Lanzhou City tap water project. The Executive Yuan has issued an order to the province, instructing them to submit the project plan for review before the funds are allocated.</p>
<p>Anxi and Yumen counties outside Jiayuguan have suffered frequent droughts over the years, often leading to disputes over water distribution. In order to eliminate water disputes between the two counties, the provincial government has decided to build the Changma Dam (with Anxi and Yumen splitting the water 40/60). The Water Conservancy and Forestry Company has been ordered to send personnel to survey the area. After the completion of this project, a total of 72,900 mu of land can be irrigated.</p>
<p>The source of Gansu Province's newspapers and other printing paper was purely from Sichuan and Shaanxi during the Anti-Japanese War, resulting in very high costs. Mr. Zhu Zunyi from Hubei, recognizing the importance of the papermaking industry in the northwest, came to Lanzhou from Sichuan to establish the Longyuan Paper Mill. Preparations have been underway for over three years, and it has now been decided to start operations in August or September. The factory will be fully machine-produced, with a daily output of two tons of paper, including newspaper and printing paper. In addition to supplying all newspapers, government agencies, and private organizations in Gansu Province, it will also be able to supply Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces.</p>
<p>Tianshui News: The roadbed along the Tianshui-Tianshui Railway was washed away in several places by rain. Train service was suspended from late May. After emergency repairs by the railway bureau, the entire line was repaired and reopened on the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>The Lanzhou Municipal Police Bureau, upon receiving orders to strengthen public security in the city, has implemented the following measures since the 19th: (1) Thoroughly investigate the population at any time, (2) All city gates will be closed at 12:00 midnight, (3) Theaters and cinemas are required to start performances at 9:00 PM and stop at 11:30 PM, with penalties for overtime, (4) Pedestrians out late at night may be questioned at any time.</p>
<p>Very little gasoline from the Yumen Oil Mine arrives in Lanzhou, and the price of gasoline in Lanzhou has recently skyrocketed again, reaching 5,000 yuan per gallon on the black market.</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Scene on the Platform - Like a Beggar's Shelter <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Once, the train derailed mid-journey, and the roadbed was damaged. There were no trains for a day, and notices were posted several times, but the content was always just about when the train would arrive and when it would depart, but the reality was that it was never on time. The train was always far away on the road. The lack of arrival news resulted in more and more passengers waiting at the station, waiting all day, from 5:00 AM to 9:00 PM, without leaving the platform. They were too tired to rest, and dared not leave their seats to eat, and had to exhaust all their energy to resist the scorching sun. The passengers were hungry, hot, and exhausted, complaining endlessly, but it was still a disappointment. The train engine broke down on the road and had to wait for a replacement engine to be sent. Only then did the passengers breathe a sigh of relief. Some got sick, some went back, some fainted! Some cried, some...fell asleep. At this time, the platform was just like a training ground for patients, madmen, and beggars.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Fresh Realm - Absorbing Rich Fragrances <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The reporter did not encounter such a bitter waiting experience, nor did they join the line to squeeze for tickets. They boarded the train as soon as they arrived at the station, and the train departed as soon as they got on. However, they were only allowed to stand on the first-class standing car, and were not allowed freedom of movement, let alone dream of a seat. This was the most crowded train without assigned seating. The car was packed with people, full of chaotic shouts, and the train departed regardless.</p>
<p>The sun was shining in from the southeast, turning the faces of those near the window red. The train chugged forward, gradually entering an old road with trees providing shade. Passengers stretched their heads out to play with the locust trees, caressing each one as if to bid farewell to the old and welcome the new. Breathing in the fragrant air from the trees, they felt a bit refreshed. If it weren't for a puff of black smoke sweeping over the trees, they would have almost forgotten they were on the train.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Reddish-Yellow Fields - Waiting for Rain to Sow <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Further ahead, they encountered a farmer driving his cattle home. People on the train started chatting with him, discussing rural economy, rural side jobs, farmers' lives, and crop yields for more than twenty minutes. Later, after encountering a fork in the road and the farmer said goodbye, everyone realized they were sitting on a train traveling a thousand miles a day, and couldn't help but look at each other and laugh in surprise! In the distance, they saw patches of reddish-yellow farmland, waiting for rain to sow!</p>
<p>The train did not stop this time, and did not stop for more than thirty minutes at any major or minor station. It can be considered a special express train on the Zhengzhou-Luoyang section! Because of this, many people were hungry and had nothing to eat, and thirsty and had nothing to drink. Often, as soon as the train stopped, they either couldn't get off the train or had just picked up their bowl when the whistle blew and the train departed. All the way to Zhengzhou, many people had empty stomachs, and many only casually filled themselves with some boiled water, cucumbers, steamed buns, or peanuts.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Sishui and Xingyang - Experiencing a Dangerous Journey <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>From Sishui to Xingyang, the track is narrow, making it the most dangerous part of the journey. The train moved very slowly. Once, going downhill and then uphill, the engine couldn't manage, resulting in the train stopping to add pressure. Passengers thought something had happened. The car was so hot and stuffy that people were anxious and getting angry. They saw the overturned train car in the ditch beside the road, which had happened a few days ago, killing more than ten people, injuring more than thirty, and damaging several railway tracks. They wondered if there were still lingering souls under the train car! Many people were warning each other.</p>
<p>Sishui's specialty is persimmon cakes and persimmon frost, making it a persimmon specialty station. Xingyang's specialty is straw braid, with many straw hats and straw bags, making it a straw braid station. The train was filled with shouts from all directions. Many people rely on this for a living, and the annual output is very large. However, if the quality, technology, packaging, and promotion do not improve, they will soon go bankrupt.</p>
<p>The train arrived in Zhengzhou at four o'clock. This part of the train journey had come to an end. Whether heading south to Hankou, north to Anyang, east to Kaifeng, or Shanghai, passengers had to change trains in Zhengzhou. The reason for changing trains is that there are too few trains to be distributed.</p>
<p>Thus, Zhengzhou has become an overnight stop, and commercial transit is particularly developed. Outside the station, both sides are lined with tea vendors pushing carts, shouting and soliciting business. People dispersed into the various neighborhoods in the midst of the chaos.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Rushing to Catch the Train Late at Night - Extremely Anxious and Uneasy <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The next morning at 6:00 AM, there was an express train to Xuzhou. Tickets were sold at 5:00 AM, and passengers had to arrive at the station as early as 3:00 or 4:00 AM to prepare. The anxiety and unease can be imagined. Although this express train was flat, it was particularly crowded because there was no sun in the morning, making it ideal weather for traveling.</p>
<p>There was only one first-class car on this train. There were more second-class cars than third-class cars, so there were the most second-class passengers. I got up at 5:50 AM and rushed to the station. The cars of all classes were already full, and the platform was piled with luggage. Many passengers were sitting and standing at the car doors. The first and second-class cars still did not have assigned seating. I went up from a less crowded area, but still barely became a standing passenger at the car door. It was even more crowded than when I came from Luoyang. Before the sun rose, the air was suffocating, and I was already sweating. People were all rushing to catch the train on an empty stomach. After getting on, they couldn't help but feel panicked and almost unable to support themselves. The standing people slowly tried to sit down, regardless of what was to the left, right, or below! I sat next to the tea stove by the door, with my soles in the water, leaning my body against the muddy door, because this hot and dirty doorway had not yet been occupied. One had to find a way to sit, as long as they were not affected by passersby, they could settle down.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Sons of Heaven - Drinking Tea Water on Hot Days <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The train started as soon as I got on. The small operators on the train, wearing blue armbands, began selling tea to passengers, busy with the work of delivering water, sending kettles, and collecting money. All the way to Zhongmu, they collected the teapots and water money, and after checking, they found that twenty or so teapots and twenty or so teacups were missing. They tried very hard to find them, but to no avail. Therefore, east of Zhongmu, their tea selling business was suspended. They said: There are too many people on the train, so it's impossible to sell tea. If the tea drips on someone, they will scold you, and if you don't deliver the water in time, those who want to drink tea are unwilling and throw the teapots out of the train. A rough pot that is only worth four or five hundred yuan, the railway bureau wants us to compensate one or two thousand yuan for each pot. The money we earn from selling tea is not enough to compensate for the pots, so what's the point of selling tea! No matter how thirsty the passengers are, they will no longer deliver water on this section to Kaifeng. Only those who stay by the tea stove can drink freely. I am fortunate to have water to drink, and I am considered a son of heaven on a hot day.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Crossing the Yellow River - The Train Speeds Up <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>East of Zhengzhou, the rice seedlings have already grown a foot tall. It can be seen that the climate in central Henan is different from that in western Henan. Farmers are sleeping under the shade of big trees to cool off. Children aged twelve or thirteen are standing naked by the village. Crossing the Middle Bridge, passengers by the window are sticking their heads out to sightsee. It is a temporary wooden bridge built by Japanese soldiers and our workers, very sturdy, and everyone is praising it. However, they don't feel so great and astonished by the turbulent Yellow River below the bridge. The water is not high, and the waves are small, flowing and turning back and forth. It is indeed not as magnificent and澎湃 as when viewed from Tongguan Xiguan!</p>
<p>Crossing the Yellow River and entering the Yi Road, the train speeds up. Under the high pressure of hunger and heat, people are hoping to arrive in Kaifeng soon. Stopping at stations two or three times, the train arrived at Kaifeng Station at 11:10 AM. I took a car and entered Kaifeng City!</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Briefs</p>
<h3 id="e126">Editor's Note <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>After the war, the politics of all countries have entered a new era of democracy and peace. Undoubtedly, China's post-war politics will also embark on the path of democratization. However, the evolution of democratic politics has its own processes and rules, and it cannot reach the ideal state overnight. Flipping through the political history of democratic advanced countries, you can see that the politics of today's countries are the result of natural development.</p>
<p>The backbone of democratic politics is the spirit of the rule of law. Although China's history of political philosophy has long been filled with democratic ideas, it is undeniable that traditional concepts emphasize rule by rites and despise rule by law. Therefore, the spirit of the rule of law still needs to be promoted and cultivated. And all rule of law must start from the lower levels of local government.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation, said early on that the foundation of the Republic of China lies in local autonomy, and that the county is the unit of autonomy, which is even more clearly stipulated in the Outline of National Reconstruction. Therefore, if China wants to implement democratic politics today, it must first earnestly promote local autonomy. The politics of democratic countries all have their grassroots organizations, and local autonomy is the grassroots political organization. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Rights is to use this grassroots organization to allow the people to exercise the four powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum in various places, in order to fully express public opinion. The main spirit of the new county system advocated by Chairman Chiang is also to "strengthen local organizations, promote autonomous undertakings, and lay the foundation for revolutionary nation-building." It can be seen that if our country really wants to transform from official governance to people's governance, it must first completely let the people govern the grassroots organizations of the locality, and then from bottom to top, the spirit of people's governance can be promoted.</p>
<p>It has been ten months since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and we should have embarked on the road of national construction and revival. Unfortunately, the state of the country is still not stable, and everything has not been fully restored to the right track, which is difficult to be satisfactory. However, the so-called "good government" in the eyes of the people is very simple: first, it must be honest, second, it must be efficient, and third, it must be able to earnestly handle affairs for the people. How can this ideal be realized? Only by starting with local autonomy, improving the grassroots political organization, and letting the people elect trustworthy people to be responsible for handling all local issues, instead of relying on official governance. Instead of chanting democracy in vain, it is better to work hard on local autonomy in a down-to-earth manner.</p>
<p>In order to assist in civil administration and promote local autonomy, our newspaper will, starting today, add a special column called "Civil Affairs Briefs." On the one hand, it will awaken the people to pay attention to public affairs and gradually cultivate the atmosphere and habits of democratic politics, and not give up the responsibility that the people should bear for local politics; on the other hand, it will awaken the government to pay attention to people's autonomy and change their past mentality of only knowing official governance. There is an old saying in our country: "Politics is not about much talk." We hope that on the eve of the implementation of constitutional government, the local authorities must use facts to show that they are promoting the people's autonomy every day, so that each county and city can become a fully autonomous county and city as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this column, we hope that the sages of the country and the citizens of this city will not hesitate to contribute to broaden the content, which is not only the honor of this newspaper, but also a help to the work of national construction.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Work of Filling and Issuing National Identity Cards is Mostly Completed - The Department of Civil Affairs Compiles Population Cards <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The work of filling and issuing national identity cards in this city is mostly completed. It is learned that, except for the entire eleventh district (Xincheng District), and the third and fourth baos of the first district, the ninth bao of the tenth district, the forty-first bao of the twelfth district, and the twelfth bao of the twenty-sixth district, which have not yet been sent to the Department of Civil Affairs for stamping, the rest have been stamped and returned to the districts and baos for residents to use. Residents who have not yet received their identity cards can go directly to the bao office to apply for them.</p>
<p>It is also learned that, after the completion of the work of filling and issuing national identity cards, the internal staff of the Department of Civil Affairs will concentrate their efforts on compiling population cards. It is said that these cards will use the joint application form for national identity cards, and compile numbers according to names, and assign numbers to the card cabinets for easy reference at any time. As for the district, bao, and household administration work, in addition to regularly urging the handling of the four types of registration: moving out, moving in, birth, and death, they are also preparing to implement household registration in accordance with the Household Registration Law, with the remaining household registration books. It is also learned that it has been decided to use the method of centralized lectures in sub-districts to provide short-term training to district, bao, and household administration personnel.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Heads of the Twenty-Fifth District Change <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>

<p>The election of city councilors in this city, except for the thirty-second district, which was postponed by the municipal government because the district was just established during the previous election and all legal procedures were not carried out in accordance with the law, all districts have been successfully completed. It is learned that the authorities of the Department of Civil Affairs, in view of the fact that the preparatory work related to the election in the district has been prepared, and the councilors of the district should be elected as soon as possible, have scheduled July 10 as the registration date for voters and candidates in the district, and have ordered the district to handle it seriously on schedule and encourage voters to participate enthusiastically.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Answering Questions about Household Administration <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Question: How do I apply for registration for a household moving to this city from another county?</p>
<p>Answer: A household or individual moving to this city with the intention of residing here for a long time can request a household registration application form from the bao head or district office in the new place of residence and apply for household registration. If there is no intention to reside here for a long time, you only need to report to the bao head for registration as a floating population.</p>
<p>Question: Why not report the move-in registration?</p>
<p>Answer: According to Article 28 of the revised Household Registration Law: "Those who move in from the jurisdiction of another household registration for more than one month without changing their registered residence shall be registered for moving in." According to this article, there are three conditions for move-in registration: First, it must be moved in from the "jurisdiction of another household registration"; second, it must be for more than one month; third, the original registered residence must not be changed. The new household that moves in does not intend to reside in this city for a long time, and naturally does not want to change its original registered residence, so it cannot apply for household registration, but it has not lived for more than one month, which does not meet the conditions for move-in registration, so it can only be registered as a floating population.</p>
<p>Question: What is the registration of floating population?</p>
<p>Answer: The so-called registration of floating population, according to Article 29 of the new Household Registration Law: "Those who move out of the jurisdiction of the original household registration for less than one month without changing their registered residence shall be registered as floating population." But if you have lived for more than one month, you have met the conditions for move-in registration, and you can re-apply for election-in registration. Request an election-in registration application form from the district office or bao office in the jurisdiction, fill it out clearly item by item, and submit it to the bao office for transfer to the district office for registration.</p>
<p>Question: What is the jurisdiction of household registration?</p>
<p>Answer: The so-called jurisdiction of household registration, according to Article 6 of the new Household Registration Law, is: "Household registration is registered in the township as the jurisdiction area, and the township chief兼住 as the head of household registration..." As for the cities directly under the central government and the provincial-level cities, it is also stipulated that the provisions of the province and the county shall be applied respectively, so this city takes the district as the jurisdiction area, and the district chief兼住 as the head of household registration.</p>
<p>Question: Who should apply for registration when the whole household elects in? How to apply for individual election? Migration registration (including selection in and out and floating population) takes the person or the head of the household as the applicant, so the whole household elects in, the head of the household applies, and the individual elects in, the person himself applies.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Enforcement Rules of the Household Registration Law <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>

<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>The train slowly pulled into the platform, the sharp whistle stirring up a wave of motion in the carriages.</p>
<p>After a long journey, Jing Sheng had already trained himself to be calm and alert. But today, his heart was especially out of control, constantly restless and uneasy. He glanced at the passenger sitting beside him, it was exactly 3:30, he stood up, straightened the long hair hanging down on his forehead, and took his suitcase from the luggage rack.</p>
<p>This was a man in his twenties, with a dark face and long hair covering his forehead, wearing an old black Zhongshan suit. Judging from his face, half of it seemed to be the erosion of wind and sand from a long journey, and the other half seemed to be severe depression.</p>
<p>His heart was pounding fiercely—when he was in the remote desert, he would fantasize about home, about his lonely mother, but he would quietly control his emotions. Now, his feet had touched the familiar land again, he knew that in an hour, the people in his fantasy would all appear before him. But he became uneasy again.</p>
<p>The train had stopped, and Jing Sheng followed the stream of people, carrying the worn-out suitcase in one hand, and squeezed out of the carriage.</p>
<p>In the station square, he saw a sea of people, tall buildings, and chaotic vehicles. Looking up at the leisurely sky, Jing Sheng saw his own loneliness. After a long separation, he tried his best to ignite his passion and anticipation.</p>
<p>Sitting on the rickshaw, he moved closer and closer to his home.</p>
<p>Jing Sheng had been separated from this bustling city for a full six years. At that time, a surge of enthusiasm moved him, causing him to abandon his home and rush to the vast future. One summer evening, he quietly boarded the ship to Haiphong. By the time his mother received his news, he was already in a university in Kunming.</p>
<p>He peered at the streets, and nothing seemed to have changed. Happiness, prosperity, people filled everything. He thought of the famine and poverty he had seen in the rural areas along the way, truly heaven and hell.</p>
<p>However, there is also hell in heaven, and there are also unhappy people. For example, Jing Sheng, even though he had arrived in heaven, still had a heavy, hellish heart.</p>
<p>The rickshaw had turned into the upper section of Huxi Road, and at a gloomy alleyway, he hurriedly told the rickshaw driver to stop.</p>
<p>Familiar, he arrived at his home, entered through the back door, turned onto the dark and narrow staircase, and at the door of the pavilion room on the second floor, he pushed the door open and went in.</p>
<p>His mother was sewing soles with a huge needle, with a head full of gray hair, a pair of glasses, and wrinkles all over her forehead. She seemed startled by the sound of the door opening, and raised her head to remove her glasses.</p>
<p>"Mom, I'm back." His voice trembled slightly, breaking the solemn atmosphere.</p>
<p>The old woman stood up tremblingly, as if happy, as if recalling a beautiful painting, her eyes seemed to be full of tears.</p>
<p>"Jing, is that you—you, you've grown taller and fatter."</p>
<p>The old woman rushed over and hugged him tightly.</p>
<p>For years, what had made Jing Sheng uneasy in his dreams was his mother. Now, what made him abandon his career and return to Shanghai at all costs was also his mother.</p>
<p>He wanted to repent, he wanted to ask his mother to forgive him, but the old woman was simply overjoyed by the reality, as if she had long forgotten all of her son's past recklessness.</p>
<p>"Jing Sheng, it's good, it's good, I've been waiting for you to come back every day—it's good, my suffering has come to an end."</p>
<p>"Jing Sheng, you haven't eaten yet, I'll go..."</p>
<p>Jing Sheng quickly calmed her down, asked her to sit on the edge of the bed, and not to rush around.</p>
<p>His uncle from upstairs also came down.</p>
<p>Jing Sheng's departure from Shanghai was also partly due to his skin’s discomfort. Since his father's death and the decline of the family, he had been relying on his mother, almost begging for support from his uncle. His uncle was a speculator, and although he was willing to take in Jing Sheng and his mother, he always made cold and sarcastic remarks that made them uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Uncle, hello, aunt, hello," Jing Sheng quickly stood up.</p>
<p>"Ah, Jing Sheng, after a few years, you've grown up too—these past few years, your old mother has really suffered to death, thinking of you every day, now her suffering is over, her son has returned with a fortune."</p>
<p>"Not at all," Jing Sheng said shyly.</p>
<p>"Don't be polite, those of you who come back, which one hasn't made a fortune, I'm getting old too, and in the future I'll have to rely more on my nephew!"</p>
<p>His uncle's words were partly sincere praise and partly sharp scolding, he could only smile bitterly.</p>
<p>After a brief exchange of greetings, his uncle went upstairs.</p>
<p>His mother's words poured out like an endless torrent, her old face full of tears, starting from the death of Jing Sheng's father, to the raising of Jing Sheng, his schooling, going to the inland, his uncle's contempt, how she had spent the past few years sewing shoes for others, how his uncle was now making a fortune, and then to Jing Sheng, since he had returned with a fortune, he should immediately get a wife, fulfill her wish, and find another house, so as not to be bullied anymore.</p>
<p>Jing Sheng couldn't help but cry too. His mother was crying about the narration of history, he was crying about the prospects for the future.</p>
<p>What could he say to comfort his mother!</p>
<p>In the six years he had been away, he had finally completed his university life in four years, and the remaining two years were spent working as a small clerk in the highway department of a certain province.</p>
<p>The news of victory made him excited, but he quickly calmed down. He missed his mother, but he couldn't return.</p>
<p>Finally, he disregarded everything, sold his luggage, and barely managed to scrape together enough money for the trip home. But he had no certainty about his own future career, and how could he possibly fulfill even one-ten-thousandth of what his family expected of him?</p>
<p>He understood that his return could not warm his home.</p>
<p>Countless social parasites, sucking the blood of others during the war, and still enjoying themselves there after the war; he, a broken heart, accompanied by his mother's broken heart.</p>
<p>He knew that when his uncle realized that he was still a pauper, he would treat him differently, and his mother would also be extremely disappointed.</p>
<p>Homecoming, he truly regretted homecoming.</p>
<p>He really wanted to leave here immediately. He wanted to love this society, but this society only loves those who have wealth and power. He knew that his mother loved him deeply, but he hated himself for not having the talent to please his mother.</p>
<p>"Mom, I'm going to leave tomorrow on this trip." He thought of leaving.</p>
<p>"What?" His mother was shocked.</p>
<p>"It's like this, it's an order from my superiors, they want to send me to Taiwan to take over a factory, so I have to leave tomorrow, anyway, transportation is convenient, I can always come back."</p>
<p>He made up a lie, and his mother somehow believed it.</p>
<p>"Orders, well, that's good too, but you have to be proper when you take over, you should be honest."</p>
<p>Jing Sheng was silent and did not answer, his head hung down heavily again.</p>
<p>The next morning, Jing Sheng raised his suitcase again and went to explore his fate in an uncertain future.</p>

<h3 id="e134">A Chapter of Melancholy (3) <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>The Melancholy of an Editor</p>
<p>Someone who doesn't know the difference between a good manuscript and a bad one is simply not fit to be an editor. When an editor sees a good manuscript, they are often happier than if they had written a good manuscript themselves. Therefore, how can an editor not know which manuscript is appropriate and which is not? Appropriate ones are published, and inappropriate ones are either returned or discarded. However, does an editor have such freedom? No!</p>
<p>An editor must consider the interests of the publisher. An editor cannot think only of running things independently. He believes that this is a legitimate opinion, and publishing it will definitely gain the approval or support of the majority. But when the boss looks at it, he says, "This kind of argument is very dangerous. Publishing it will immediately cause trouble. Be cautious, be cautious!" Under ten thousand cautions, you have no choice but to sacrifice your argument and not publish it. You believe that this is a legitimate creation, and publishing it can enhance the status of your publication. But the boss says again, "Status isn't money. Do fewer things that don't make money; businesses that lose money are absolutely not to be done!" At the same time, the boss hands you promotional materials and entertainment pieces, asking you to publish them. You don't want to? There's no reason for that, unless you don't want to eat his rice under his rule. You have no choice but to obey!</p>
<p>What you want to publish, you can't; what you don't want to publish, you are forced to. This is the melancholy of you, the editor! How will you break it? You can't break it, hence the melancholy!</p>
<p>Of course, you all think of starting your own publication. But the first obstacle is that you don't have capital. You can't build a house with bare hands, and your plan ultimately cannot be realized. You are melancholy! Even if the capital is raised, you are not good at managing it, working from dawn to dusk but still having no clue. It still can't be done. You are melancholy! You succeed in starting it, and you publish the manuscripts you have selected, but one side says you are not tough enough, the other side says you are not stimulating enough, and another side even says you have ulterior motives and are being used. The public remains ignorant and unaware, not understanding your good intentions at all, as if nothing has happened. You are even more melancholy, greatly melancholy! For the sake of life, for the sake of the things you are used to doing, you cannot change your profession, so you have no choice but to give up your ambition to create and turn back to cultural merchants to seek a livelihood. Melancholy, melancholy, a hundred and twenty times melancholy!</p>
<p>If the boss is only concerned with publicity and not with making money, then your melancholy will only increase!</p>
<p>You are sorry for the writers; when writers question you, you will definitely have unspeakable suffering and unspeakable melancholy.</p>
<p>Your melancholy resentment will be concentrated on the boss and the publisher!</p>
<h3 id="e135">On Writing <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>——Don't ask what it is, say what you want to say, because only your own words can be said intimately, and people feel intimately. If you are a poet, whether the object you are singing about is beauty, ugliness, heaven, or humanity, you must have true feelings for it. You cannot force it, you cannot perfunctorily do it, you cannot just follow the trend, you must write your own things without any pretense.——</p>
<p>For any author, the most important aspect of their work is honesty. Honesty. The importance of honesty lies above the novelty of the subject matter, the completeness of the structure, and the fluency of the writing. That is, the work must be honest about the life that is clearly understood objectively and experienced subjectively by you. Honesty does not mean that the author must have actually experienced the life mentioned in the work, but that all the lives mentioned in the work are indeed the feelings and human nature that the author clearly understands intellectually and is able to experience emotionally. Many people, because they feel that their own lifestyle is not fresh, deliberately choose some special and romantic lives that they are not familiar with as the subject matter, and then use their limited imagination to exaggerate the emotions that they do not have, in order to gain the sympathy of the readers. This kind of creation not only wastes words to exaggerate false scenes and emotions, but also makes those serious readers who want to enrich their lives and understand life from the work feel very impatient and disappointed.</p>
<p>The richness of life experience does not lie in the number of different ways of life; such as having been an apprentice, and also pushed a wheelbarrow; traveled through Gansu, and also traveled through Yunnan. What matters is the sharpness and agility of both the objective observation and the subjective feeling, the ability to understand and taste what is seen, heard, and experienced in many ways; to understand the relationships and connections between people in life; the dramatic changes that occur between the fixed and the accidental; and finally, to have one's own special views, thoughts, beliefs, and philosophy.</p>
<p>A person with rich life experience does not lie in having seen many things objectively, but in being able to subjectively evoke very complex and different emotions, and in being able to sympathize with many aspects of human nature.</p>
<p>Therefore, an author, in addition to the technical knowledge of using words, must be able to stand on any living earth, be able to move freely between the subjective and the objective, between emotion and understanding, and rationally and emotionally run wild, with memory and imagination complementing each other, to the point where the true is the false and the false is the true. Only then can his pen appear lively and sincere. His works will be substantial and great, unaffected by subject matter and words, and will be able to move people lastingly and universally.</p>
<p>An author must truly gain experience, so that he can have his own convictions. Similarly, the evaluation of the work will always be in the hands of serious readers.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Cup of Life <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>When anyone leaves the mother's womb and makes their first cry, a strange cup of life is held in their hand.</p>
<p>At first, this cup is extremely light, as light as a silk thread in the clear sky, almost imperceptible. Gradually, the silk thread transforms into a pure white lily, full of sweet nectar, blooming in the warm sunlight, emitting a faint fragrance and a subtle sweetness—an unparalleled liquid of joy overflows in the lily cup of childhood—</p>
<p>But soon, this beautiful cup changed. First, the gentle wind and drizzle added a little weight to the cup, and then the thin frost and snow reduced a little fragrance from the cup. Gradually, it became smooth and bright, and gradually, it became a layer of fragile glass, able to see through the clouds and mist, and through the thunder and lightning; able to illuminate the wind and rain, and illuminate the dark night. And unknowingly, a cup of incomparably sweet nectar completely changed its taste—, the happy childhood had forever passed away.</p>
<p>The first sip of bitter liquid in adolescence is not difficult to taste but carries a stimulation, like a dilution of Coptis chinensis mixed with strong alcohol, making people feel dry, restless, chaotic, and confused. It also makes people like a group of hungry and thirsty bees, some in the moonlight, some in front of flowers, frantically and desperately chasing the sweet juice of life. As a result, they found it, but they were also disappointed: Often when they just poured a few drops of the sweet juice that they had chased with all their life's strength into one end of the cup, at the other end of the cup, the bitter liquid of life endlessly surged and submerged everything. So they shouted painfully: "Is the essence of life so bitter?"—This is the beginning of middle age.</p>
<p>As the years flew by, this cup became heavier and more complicated day by day. It was as heavy as a thousand-pound hammer, pressing tightly on people's shoulders, making it impossible to bear or let go. It was as complex as a vast ocean, storing countless and ever-changing strange tastes, bitter, astringent, sour, and spicy juices. Until the old age of silver hair arrives, it is like the scorching sun absorbing the sea water, and the last drop of life, the liquid of life, dries up, and this cup drifts away and obtains eternal rest——death!</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Thirteen</p>
<p>Half a year later, Hua was already receiving 100 silver dollars a month. She no longer needed to continue learning opera. There was nothing more to teach about stringed instruments. Madam Mo stopped teaching opera with stringed accompaniment and only let him be Hua's qin player. The remuneration for teaching opera was changed to the remuneration for being a qin player. Lihua even considered not letting Zhang Xian play the huqin anymore. But strangely enough, Lihua had tested it. When others played the huqin for her, her singing felt unnatural, and she even said "board" in a deep voice. (Meaning the musical beat.) Perhaps it was out of habit. But it wasn't Zhang Xian's huqin, yet she didn't feel any discomfort because of it. This was a painful contradiction. Lihua disliked Zhang Xian from the bottom of her heart, but for the sake of "opera," she couldn't do without Zhang Xian!</p>
<p>A year later, two years later, three years later; Lihua's position in this theater rose from a third-class actor to a second-class actor; now she has leaped from a second-class actor to a first-class actor; completely as Zhang Xian had predicted. Indeed, she has now snatched Shi Yulou's "top billing." Now she and Shi Yulou take turns singing the final act. In these three years, she had almost helped Madam Mo earn back all the invested capital. But this still couldn't satisfy Madam Mo, who was far from her budget. It was as if Lihua was building a golden house for her, and now it was just laying the foundation. At the same time, Lihua herself still didn't feel happy because of her progress, learning was so depressing, so silent! As if all her gains were not hers, and had nothing to do with her. And this kind of thought matured more and more with her age, she saw everything more and more lightly, more and more empty!</p>
<p>The "top billing" was taken down, and now he was indeed "getting worse and worse"! His voice was getting worse day by day, and sometimes he simply couldn't sing. One day, it was his turn to perform the opera "Jin Dian Zhuang Feng" (Feigning Madness in the Golden Palace). When he sang about feigning madness, his throat suddenly went completely hoarse, and he couldn't sing a single sentence! The audience below kept "jeering" and calling for refunds! He was anxious on stage, but there was nothing he could do. Later, the audience shouted for refunds, and he was angry and ashamed; a rush of blood surged, his nerves fell into chaos, and he really went mad. He hit the people under the stage; he laughed; he cursed; he finally burst into tears! The order was in chaos for a while, and everyone hurriedly pulled him backstage and sent him home. From then on, his mind lost its normal state.</p>
<p>Lihua witnessed this tragedy and suffered a serious shock. She grieved for Shi Yulou, and also grieved for herself! Although she didn't quite understand why an actor would end up like this? But she intuitively felt that singing opera was a path of self-destruction! If you sing well, someone will support you; if you don't sing well, someone will smash you. But can you always sing well? No! You will not sing well because of illness, because of old age, and for all kinds of reasons that Lihua wouldn't yet be aware of! At that time, you can only fall down! "Fall down" like Shi Yulou! Thinking of this, she was heartbroken! She was terrified! She only knew that as long as she sang, she fulfilled her "obligation" as a human being; but now she knew even more: not only sing, but also sing well; sing well forever; only then can she fulfill her "obligation" as a human being. But this was simply impossible, Shi Yulou was an example! If she had such a day - such a day like Shi Yulou, what would she do? What would Madam Mo do? Madam Mo would force her to sing again; still sing well; sing well for a long time! Just like when she took her to learn opera before... Heavens! She was going crazy too! She was about to go crazy!</p>

<p>— Translated by Zhong Deqi</p>
<p>The author of this article, Professor J. Lossing Buck, is the founder of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Jinling University. He has been in China for more than 20 years and has extensive research on China's agricultural problems. Mr. Buck has conducted a lot of practical surveys of rural China. The editor has books such as "Chinese Farm Economy," "Chinese Land Utilization," and "Chinese Farm Management," and is China's most loyal friend. He returned to the United States the year before last. In the special issue commemorating the department in January, although there was much discussion by Chinese scholars on the issue of agricultural mechanization in China in the future, there was little research on actual mechanical agricultural implements in China. As for international experts who have researched Chinese agriculture, especially those who express opinions on this issue, we are now translating this manuscript as a reference for those who are interested in this issue, and also to welcome this old professor who will soon return to China to continue teaching. Respectfully attached. May 27th.</p>
<p>Farm implements and mechanical equipment are used to make farm work more perfect, economical, easy, fast, and to do work that humans cannot do. The scope of their utilization is mostly based on whether they can increase profits, that is, to increase the area of cultivated land per person and the production volume per unit of capital.</p>
<p>Farm equipment can be divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Cultivation, fertilization, and seeding equipment</p>
<p>(2) Harvesting equipment</p>
<p>(3) Processing equipment: (shelling, peeling, collecting, threshing, packaging, removing seeds, cleaning, harvesting, milling, etc.)</p>
<p>(4) Power equipment; including electricity</p>
<p>(5) Transportation equipment</p>
<p>(6) Water source control equipment</p>
<p>(7) Horticultural equipment</p>
<p>(8) Spraying equipment</p>
<p>(9) Livestock and poultry equipment</p>
<p>(10) Farm buildings</p>
<p>(11) Agricultural product manufacturing equipment</p>
<p>(12) Household equipment</p>
<p>(13) Other equipment</p>
<p>Cultivation, fertilization, and seeding equipment are classified into one category because some tools perform all three functions. Water source control equipment includes various pumps, soil removal, and land fertility maintenance equipment.</p>
<p>The total amount of work completed by each tool or machine in a unit of time (usually ten hours per day) is called the "Rate of Work," and the total amount of work completed by each cubic foot of tool or each horsepower of a threshing machine is called the "Duty of Implement and of machinevy." It varies depending on the size and style of the tool, the nature of the work completed, the type and condition of the soil, the power, the obstacles in the field, and the distance between the farmhouse and the field.</p>
<p>In the United States, each foot of width of the tool or machine can work one to three acres per day (that is, six to eighteen Chinese mu). The higher rate of work is three acres or ten gongshi mu per day, which is usually only achieved with a tractor. The lower rate of work is one acre or less per day.</p>
<p>In the United States, most agricultural implements have more than one foot of working width, while in China, except for the handle, they have less than one foot of working width. Most Chinese agricultural implements are of the one-horse type. In southern China, most draught animals are water buffalo, and in northern China, they are yellow cattle. Regarding the "Duty," there are no records in China so far. In the comparison of "Rates of Work," the amount of work completed by each person in the United States using one agricultural implement and one or more draught animals in each operation is higher than that completed by each person in China under the same conditions. In China, the "Rate of Work" for the same operation varies depending on the style of the agricultural implement. For example, one person using a Chinese sickle that can cut eight to ten rows of rice at a time can cut 1.7 English acres or 10.2 Chinese mu per day, but if using a sickle, they can only cut 0.46 acres or 2.8 Chinese mu per day. The area cultivated by a cultivator pulled by one draught animal is much larger than that cultivated by a hoe. The former can cultivate 1.7 acres or 11.4 Chinese mu per day, while the latter can only cultivate 0.4 acres or 2.5 Chinese mu.</p>
<p>The comparison between a sickle and a scythe is the same as the comparison between a cultivator and a hoe, which are more labor-saving agricultural implements. Labor-saving agricultural implements, machinery, and equipment have the benefit of working at the right time and reducing costs, which can enable work to be completed when it should be completed; such as when the soil conditions are suitable, when crops should be planted, when weeds should be removed (before they grow too large), and when they should be harvested (before the grains are overly ripe or damaged by adverse weather). However, labor-saving agricultural implements sometimes also have disadvantages, such as scythes cannot cut crops that have been blown down by the wind, and Chinese scythes are too light to harvest heavy crops, easily wasting grains and messing up straw.</p>
<p>Chinese farmers have tried their best to choose agricultural implements that are suitable for their environment, but it is possible and urgently needed to improve them.</p>
<p>The average number of equipment on each Chinese farm is 28 pieces. With at least 60,000,000 farm households, the total number of major agricultural implements is approximately 1,680,000,000 pieces. The average value of agricultural implements per acre is 2.5 yuan (translator's note: this is the value before the Sino-Japanese War, and the following estimated numbers are also the same), which is about one-third of the value of farm machinery per acre in the United States.</p>
<p>The materials used to manufacture Chinese agricultural implements are mainly wood and iron. The ploughshare and mouldboard of the plough are made of iron. More than two thousand years before the American Newbold invented the cast iron plow, when the cast iron plow was invented in the United States 150 years ago, the farmers there were afraid to use it because they feared that iron would harm the soil and help the growth of weeds.</p>
<p>Although China has had refined agricultural implements for centuries, it has not made any improvements to date. For example, according to estimates, if better metal could be used to maintain the sharpness of the hoe edge and reduce the necessary degree of wear, 15% to 20% less labor could be used when hoeing. (But China generally does not pay attention to this.)</p>
<p>Currently, the manufacture of agricultural implements is mostly carried out on a small scale in workers' homes. Blacksmiths cast the iron parts, and carpenters make the wooden parts. In the context of rapid advances in modern technology, regardless of whether the cost remains the same or increases, more efficient agricultural implements should be produced. Although farmers pay a higher price, the labor savings and increased production will be more than what they pay.</p>
<p>Number of Agricultural Implements per Farm</p>
<p>The number of implements per farm is based on the area of cultivation and the number of days required to complete the cultivation. For example: if the field must be plowed within ten days after the wheat harvest in order to insert rice seedlings, and each plow can plow three mu per day, then thirty mu can be plowed in ten days. But if the farmer has forty mu to plant rice, then one plow feels insufficient, and two plows feel too many. So farmers have several solutions: they can rent a plow to plow the extra ten mu, but this is often not easy to do, because other farmers also need to plow their fields at this time, and rents rise. Another solution is to risk reducing yields by plowing early or late at the appropriate time, or to expand the farm area, that is, to rent (or buy) twenty more mu to match the efficiency of agricultural implements. If the local area is particularly suitable for growing rice, it does not seem wise to cleverly use part of the land to grow other crops in order to allocate labor. Another method, which may be the best, is to use a larger plow and a larger draught animal or a stronger draught animal, which can plow four mu per day, and can also plow the field in ten days. On a farm, a good combination of various agricultural implements, draught animals, labor, and crop types can make the most effective use of agricultural implements, labor, and livestock.</p>
<p>The cost of using an efficient tool varies depending on the number of days it is used each year. The cost of agricultural implements includes investment interest, depreciation, storage, repair, and usage costs (such as lubricating oil for machinery and fuel for engines). In China in 1935, the average cost of various agricultural implements per Chinese mu of crop was 0.365 yuan (or US$0.60 per English acre), and the total cost accounted for 41% of the value of the agricultural implements (calculated at market prices at the time).</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Importance of Construction <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>I have explained the importance of a positive attitude in difficult environments. But having a positive attitude still requires continuous construction work, because construction work cannot wait for the passage of time. Many construction projects cannot be successful overnight, so it is even more necessary to do them step by step, day by day, and accumulate over time to create a good foundation.</p>
<p>China's industry was originally backward. At this difficult and important time, if we do not engage in construction, we will never be able to compare with the production capacity of advanced countries. Therefore, for survival, to overcome future difficulties, active construction can also be said to be the key plan of the current industry.</p>

<p>E. Lighting: Lighting is very important in manufacturing plants, especially in places where delicate work is done. Many goods that do not meet standards and accidents that occur in manufacturing plants can be said to be due to insufficient lighting. Before the war, the Shanghai Electric Power Company often published advertisements urging manufacturers to pay attention to the lighting problems in their factories. At the same time, they could also send personnel to inspect the lighting problems in various factories for free. They had a table that could measure whether the lighting was appropriate.</p>
<p>Equipment in Factories</p>
<p>After building a factory, a single factory building cannot carry out production. It is necessary to put in the necessary equipment. This equipment includes various machines, parts, and necessities for rotating parts such as cabinets and shelves.</p>
<p>In smaller factories, the equipment purchased is as simple as possible, because it can be done at a lower cost. But sometimes, a business develops rapidly, then it is necessary to increase equipment immediately.</p>
<p>When purchasing equipment, one point should be considered, that is, many machines are constantly changing with each passing day. After a period of time, new types of machines are manufactured. Then, when purchasing, you should consider this point. You should have a budget to prepare to purchase newer machines within a few years, and in terms of productivity, strive for speed, so that the depreciation of these machines can be used up within a few years. When there are new machines, you can have the strength to purchase them.</p>
<p>Principles of Factory Layout</p>
<p>The work inside the factory should of course be as convenient as possible, so when laying out, it should be arranged according to the order of the work to make the work proceed very smoothly. For example, for the completion of a single product, it is necessary to go through ten steps. Then, if you link these ten steps directly, it can proceed smoothly. If the first step is done on the first floor, the second step is done on the fourth floor, and the third step is done on the second floor, then the raw materials and products in the process have to be taken up and down. The work cannot proceed smoothly, and the waste of time and manpower becomes a huge loss. In many old factories, this phenomenon often occurs because the buildings are gradually added.</p>
<p>The factory of the Ewo Brewery Company has a total of five floors. First, the raw materials such as barley and yeast are sent from the bottom floor to the top floor by electricity, and then, through fermentation and other work, they come down layer by layer. At the end, the bottling part is in the bottom room. The bottling and boxing areas are very close, and the boxing area is connected to the landowner of the rotary transport vehicle. This kind of factory is of course designed by experts, so the progress of the work is very smooth.</p>

<p>The life of the genius mathematician Hua Luogeng is a moving story. He was only a junior high school graduate. He worked as a shop assistant in the cotton shop opened by his father for five years. He also served as a clerk and accountant in the Jintan Junior High School. He was always attacked and left. It was not until he was twenty-one years old that he was introduced to Tsinghua as an assistant in the Department of Mathematics.

<p>Two people had a decisive effect on his current achievements. One was Wang Weike, a teacher at Yutan Junior High School, and the other was Kang Xueyu, a fellow villager. The former constantly encouraged and helped him before and after he graduated from junior high school, and the latter introduced him to Tsinghua, allowing him to have the opportunity to develop and perform.</p>
<p>In the world academic community, Hua Luogeng's achievements have been recognized as first-class standards. The Soviet Academy of Sciences specially invited him to give lectures. His "Theory of Sum of Least Primes" is world-renowned.</p>
<p>The world has Bole, but it must also have a thousand-mile horse; if there is no Wang Weike or Kang Peiyu, how can there be the current Hua Luogeng.</p>
<p>A person's life, opportunities often determine success or failure, there are many talented but unrecognized people in history, making future generations infinitely regret their obscurity!</p>
<p>Historical mistakes, if they are to be avoided from being repeated, must have these two principles: hope that others will recognize and promote you, but also help others at any time, so that everyone can use their talents to the fullest.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Monkey King Temple <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>Monkey King Temple is just a temple that is neither big nor small, but like Song Wang Tai, it is known as one of Hong Kong's scenic spots, and it is not far from Song Wang Tai, both on a small hill outside Kowloon City. What is particularly attractive about Monkey King Temple is the "Chicken" character drawn in one stroke on a black rock mountain behind the temple. Someone claims that it is the handwriting of Wang Xizhi, which is of course a rumor and an attachment. But its flowing brushstrokes have also given the business of a popular restaurant in Central a wall painting. It is following behind people and working for its own daily blessings. So every time I go, I always order this dish, and then wait aside for my five internal organs temple (stomach) to be sacrificed to.</p>
<p>Traveling Medicine Man</p>
<p>According to the temple stele, Hou Wang has a real name, he was a dead traveling medicine man. Emperor Song led the defeated army to flee here. Most of the soldiers were infected with diseases and could not find medicine. Hou Wang showed a good prescription in a dream. After the emperor woke up, he ordered people to collect raw medicine according to the prescription, and the medicine cured the disease. The whole army was unharmed. The emperor felt that he had meritorious service in his dreams, so he recognized him as Hou Wang, and ordered the construction of temples so that he could receive incense for generations to come. The incense is still flourishing today. Especially it can be immortal with the legends of Song Wang Tai.</p>
<p>Restaurants Around the Hill</p>
<p>Song Wang Tai and Hou Wang Temple form an oblique line; no one who goes to Song Wang Tai does not go to Hou Wang Temple, but those who go to Hou Wang Temple do not necessarily go to Mi Wang Tai. The reason is that Hou Wang is a god, and he has spiritual power, which can attract many devout men and women; Song Wang Tai is just a vegetable garden, slightly embellished with artificial decorations. Except for those who cherish the past to climb and lament, or sightseeing, it is not enough to compare with Hou Wang Temple. In addition to idols for people to worship, Hou Wang Temple has many places to eat around the hill. And the furnishings in those places: bamboo children and thatched huts, are very interesting, plus everything is ready-made. Almost like Rong Kui, with high hopes, familiar customers can choose themselves. Especially the cooking is proper, and it is very delicious, which is invisibly a great help to the liveliness there.</p>
<p>Middle-Aged Beggar</p>
<p>There is also a miracle at Monkey King Temple, a middle-aged beggar squatting under a big tree every day. He is supported by someone, and he has never been seen begging for a penny from tourists, and he is always so solemn and does not talk much. He especially has cold eyes, watching those filial pieties, respecting wooden puppets and actually respecting the superstitious people of the temple priest. But his cold eyes do not have much intention, they are just a pair of cold eyes. I have been to Hou Wang Temple no less than ten times in a few years, and every time I see him, he is in this image. I feel strange, and I also feel puzzled, because I cannot find out his origin.</p>
<p>Hou Wang Chao Temple is a rather lively place, and after the loneliness arises, it will be like the wind and clouds dispersing.</p>

<p>— Gang</p>
<p>Increased by Eight Million in Five Years</p>
<p>According to official reports from the United States, the US population increased by approximately eight million between April 1, 1940, and July 1, 1945, including troops abroad.</p>
<p>On July 1, 1940, the total population of the United States was approximately 139,621,431. The last U.S. population survey counted a total of 131,669,275 people. Since last July, the US population has continued to increase. As of October 1, 1945, the U.S. population had already exceeded 140 million.</p>
<p>Since 1940, the increase in the US population has been approximately nine-tenths of that between 1930 and 1940. The main reason for the increase in the US population rate is the increase in the wartime fertility rate, while the mortality rate remains relatively low.</p>
<p>Low mortality rate, high fertility rate, plus more people migrating in than migrating out, the U.S. population cannot but increase.</p>

<p>In the past three years, the University of Illinois in the United States has invented 50 types of artificial rubber.</p>
<p>Professor Marvel predicts that within two years, artificial rubber will surpass natural rubber.</p>
<p>Of the 50 new types of artificial rubber, the most exciting is sodium rubber. In the past, the biggest disadvantage of making rubber was its poor heat resistance and it was easier to manufacture. Sodium rubber has greatly improved in both of these areas.</p>
<p>Professor Marvel said that current artificial rubber tires are already as good as natural rubber tires.</p>
<p>In 1942, artificial rubber tires could travel 3,000 miles at 30 miles per hour. Now, they can travel 55,000 miles at 50 miles per hour.</p>
<h3 id="e145">A Country Fly's Letter <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— John</p>
<p>City Flies: I hope all is well. We have arrived in the countryside and all aspects of our life are more comfortable than in the towns and cities. Now, I will briefly tell you about it.</p>
<p>In the city, every day you must find your own food, running around busily. Even if you find something, it is nothing more than sour rice and bitter vegetables. Sometimes you even suffer at the hands of health inspectors. We often inquire and hear that many of our city brothers have perished under "DDT". How dangerous! How terrifying! But in the countryside, you don't have to work hard for food. You could say that everywhere is like a silver plate or golden tray. Cow sheds! Pig pens! Dung pits! All are our dining halls and our lodges, and they are permanent and stable. Therefore, our brothers generally enjoy the blessings of a past life. In the countryside, not only is the food more plentiful and easier to obtain than in the city, but the most interesting thing is that when we eat, the country folk don't issue eviction orders like the city people do, and they let us eat our fill as much as possible. We often hear them say, "Anyway, flies will come back even if you chase them away, and you can't get rid of them all, so just let them be! Besides, they won't necessarily cause any trouble!" They also can't afford "DDT", and even if they could, they wouldn't know how to use it. Therefore, they blame the city health inspectors for being too strict, often uttering curses against the investigators. Naturally, we like to hear this the most, and we obey it the most, often finding ourselves in a situation where we have no choice but to grab whatever is in front of us. Don't you think it's interesting and fun? Do you have such an environment there?</p>
<p>When dishes are placed on the table, we smell the fragrance and fly out in groups from our lodges to taste the fresh and delicious flavors that people haven't eaten yet. Some brothers are so happy that they get drunk and fall into the dishes, never to wake up. Those country people can't tell right from wrong at all. They swallow the corpses that have fallen into the dishes along with the dishes. Even if they find corpses in the dishes, they are not angry and don't throw away the dishes together. They just gently pick out the corpses with chopsticks. City flies: If you encountered this situation in your place, I'm afraid you would die without a burial place, right? City flies: In the countryside! These few points are the most common, and there are many other comfortable places. In short, our life is so free, happy, comfortable, and interesting. Our environment is as different from that of the city as heaven and earth. It's too stable, too carefree.</p>
<p>We are of the same kind and should help each other and cooperate. In the spirit of "sharing good fortune and weathering misfortune together," the city is a dangerous area and should not be inhabited for long. When you have time, we hope that you will also come to the countryside. At that time, we can lead you to enjoy the unique delicacies, comfortable environment, and sweet life. What is written here is only a small part. You must come to the countryside yourself to appreciate it. I won't talk much. Goodbye! I wish you good health! Country flies send their regards.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Spinach is Harmful <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Oriental Thorn</p>
<p>Most people think that spinach is a nutritious food, but recently, Dr. Wittle and Dr. Abbott of the University of Missouri announced that spinach may damage human health.</p>
<p>From a nutritional point of view, leafy green vegetables have both advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>The oxalic acid content in spinach is quite high. Oxalic acid combines with the calcium in the vegetables, which may damage human health.</p>
<p>Moreover, the oxalic acid in spinach may combine with the calcium in other foods, which would be an even greater loss. Scientific evidence shows that eating too much spinach can cause bone decalcification.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will ask, then what about the iron in spinach? Spinach contains a lot of iron. This is always beneficial, right? Nutritionists also have an answer to this: only 20% of the trace elements in spinach can be absorbed by the body.</p>
<p>Therefore, spinach is not as beneficial as people propagate, but blind humans are blowing spinach up. In the past decade, spinach consumption has increased eightfold. How ridiculous and lamentable!</p>

<h3 id="e147">Roads, Roads - Not Even a Face <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>The Communists captured Qu-Fu, and the metal ritual vessels in Kong Guangnei were all looted. This can let people who don't understand "all cleared" policies, understand "all cleared".</p>
<p>When we are sitting in a car driving on the road, if it weren't for the tall buildings on both sides, I would really suspect that I was back on the Qian-Gui Road. This makes people think that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has no choice but to suspend even the surface work due to financial difficulties, and of course they have unspeakable grievances. Especially since Chinese people have always been particular about "face," imagine how painful it must be in their hearts when a person can't even take care of their "face." Roads represent the face of a city, and Shanghai's roads, which once maintained a clean and charming appearance before the war, have become riddled with holes after eight years of war and one year of chaos, plus the occurrence of diseases, resulting in a skeletal and ugly appearance.</p>
<p>The representatives who were beaten claimed to be "people's representatives." All the expenses for their stay in the hospital after being "injured" should, in principle, be borne by the "people," but it was not the "people" who paid the money. I wonder where those "people" went.</p>
<p>Zhang Naiqi's younger sister recently fought with Huang Yanpei's daughter over the relocation of housing, and the case is about to be taken to court. A newspaper said, "The two are so unpeaceful that heaven will not become democratic." From small to large, housing disputes in Shanghai are a lawsuit that will never be cleared.</p>
<p>After square publications were banned, we considered the printing houses, with a loss of 40,000,000 yuan per month. The indirect impact includes screenwriters, writers, newspaper vendors, and distributors in other provinces, totaling more than 100,000 people. The honor of "Miss Hong Kong" was seized by Guan Tuantuan. In fact, Ping Nan's father's surname is Liang, so her real surname is Liang. According to Guan Tuantuan, the first condition for a son-in-law is health. At the same time, she reported that horseback riding is a student's hobby and that she has seven years of experience. If we combine equestrian skills and experience in taming horses into one topic, I think Miss Guan must have the art of taming her husband.</p>
<p>"Keeping the husband's 'root' clean is the wife's 'duties'.” The mayor's wife made this view in a speech at the Women's Youth Association. It can be said that she is scratching the itch of Miss Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e148">No Limit on Transfer Fees or Deposits - Two Years of Rent in Advance <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Wuling Man</p>
<p>Some people advocate reforming the clothing of monks in order to cultivate a lively atmosphere in Buddhism. I agree, and at the same time, I would like to suggest that the French priests and nuns should also reform their similar clothing in order to cultivate a "lively atmosphere" in Catholicism.</p>
<p>A small advertisement for [Couple's Tiny House] was published in the newspaper, which reads; "Young couple without children, a clean and quiet room with minimal sanitary facilities; those who intend to sublet, please submit a letter to a certain place, if suitable, we will come to treat, if not suitable, we will keep it secret." It can be seen that there are many unmentionable "secrets" in renting out houses. The authorities hope to stop the charging of gold bars as transfer fees, while those who are seeking a house are willing to keep the "secrets", no wonder the advertisements for transfer fees are still eye-catching.</p>
<p>The authorities have already noticed the advertisements for transfer fees in the newspapers and are strictly cracking down on the act of transferring houses. However, is it also in the scope of crackdown if no transfer fee is charged, no deposit is collected, the monthly rent is 100,000 yuan, but two years of rent must be paid in advance at once?</p>
<p>French Democracy Day, in the past, on July 14th, there must have been a celebration in the French Concession. In addition to holding military parades and banquets, the authorities decorated Xiafei Road with red, blue and white tricolor lanterns, stretching as far as the eye could see. Visitors to Gujiazhai Park were like clouds, and as a result, many citizens were often arrested for violating prohibitions. The French's arrogance often made thoughtful people sigh secretly. After the recovery of the concession, such a grand occasion will no longer appear. But at this moment, perhaps some residents in the former concession are still yearning for everything in the past.</p>
<p>Jing Gengqiu, the female pirate leader who ran rampant in the Dapeng Bay area fifteen years ago, is now 37 years old and was recently arrested in Guangdong. Fifteen years ago, the female bandit was only about twenty years old. Chinese newspapers once called her the Pirate Queen. The three characters "Jing Gengqiu" are elegant. The fact that she is called the Queen of Pirates and is also young and beautiful with talent, cannot help but make people imagine.</p>

<p>(1) Shen Mintong asks: I am seventeen years old this year, female, and have always been very fat, especially in the face. Recently, I have become even fatter and always growing taller. I am currently four feet six and a half inches tall in the Chinese system. I don't know if I will continue to grow taller. What is the standard height for women now? What medicine can I take to thin down, or what kind of substance have I been eating too much of? Will reducing this substance help me lose weight? What kind of consumption method or exercise can make me grow taller? I hope the doctor will reply soon.</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Yu Xin'en, Doctor of Medicine] You need to do more exercises and eat less meat and fatty foods. Special physical exercises may help you grow taller. You need to seek guidance from experts.</p>
<p>(2) Wu Zhicheng asks: Editor, I have several questions. Please give me your advice so that patients can follow the treatment and get rid of the pain as soon as possible. I would be very grateful. (1) I heard that penicillin can cure gonorrhea, but is there any hope of a radical cure for chronic turbidity? How many tablets or units should I take? (2) Are there any truly reliable and famous doctors in Shanghai who can treat this disease? (3) I heard that penicillin is not very effective in treating lung disease, but is there any harm in taking it? (4) Is testing for gonorrhea just a urine test? Do ordinary hospitals test for it? (5) Is "hormone" used to treat kidney disease? Is there a tablet, and how many should I take?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Yu Xin'en, Doctor of Medicine] (1) Penicillin is effective in curing gonorrhea or leucorrhea, and the number of units depends on the condition of each patient. (2) Except for quack doctors, everyone else is fine. (3) It is ineffective, so there is no need to take it. (4) All hospitals can do it. In addition to urine tests, you can also test blood and prostatic fluid. (5) Please ask the doctor to decide whether it is necessary.</p>
<p>(3) Mei Moxi asks: I suddenly suffered from a skin disease this year. The symptoms are as follows: There are pimples on the pores of the epidermis, which are neither painful nor itchy, but the pimples are as hard as rough sandpaper and feel quite prickly when touched by hand. Within a small circle of this pimple, the skin also seems to be hardened. I am uneasy because of the illness, and I dare not see a doctor because of my poor financial situation. I hope that the doctor will tell me the cause of my illness and the most effective treatment method.</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Yu Xin'en, Doctor of Medicine] It is a type of vitamin A deficiency. You need to ingest a large amount of vitamin A-containing cod liver oil. Foods that are high in vitamin A include carrots, red amaranth leaves, spinach, fresh milk, tomatoes, green peppers, eggs, and black sesame seeds.</p>

<p>The Disaster is Serious, Everyone Should Help According to Their Ability to Create Blessings for Future Generations</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I have just read in your newspaper about the famine in Li County, Hunan Province, where grass roots and tree bark have been almost exhausted for food. Upon hearing this, I express my deepest sympathy. I have saved food and money to raise 50,000 yuan in national currency. Although the amount is small, it is the best effort of the specially selected officers and soldiers of my family. It is not to seek fame or profit, but only to express my sincere intention and appeal to people in power to understand the suffering of others, gather strength together so that our compatriots in deep water and fire can reach prosperity. This is not only their good fortune, but also the good fortune of the country. I hope you will publish this and transfer the funds as soon as possible. With best wishes, the officers and soldiers of the 10th Company, 4th Battalion, 8th Traffic Police Regiment. June 28th.</p>
