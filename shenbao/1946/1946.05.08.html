<p>〔本報北平七日電〕軍調部昨日之委員會議中，對當前各地化整爲零之紛亂及近來迭次發生之破壞交通情事，辯論頗烈，美方饒伯森委員打破沉默，指摘甚多，故有加強執行小組工作，以維調處尊嚴之決議。但三方暗示東北問題如不解決，何等決議皆屬一紙空文，而各方均盼宣化店問題迅速解決，俾早恢復東北問題之協商。南通與高密二地衝突，均不另派小組，而遣淮陰小組就近赴南通，濟南小組赴高密謀求解決。赤峯小組美方代表柏瑞斯報告軍調部謂：彼曾於四月中旬因欲由赤峯赴國軍駐地聯絡，事前未通知共方，而被當地共軍扣留數小時，軍調部美方對此已向共方提抗議。又新派之永年小組，今晨已出發。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口六日電〕三人委員會政府代表徐永昌，中共代表周恩來及軍調執行部執行處長白魯德（代表馬歇爾）三氏抵漢後，即邀有關方面負責人澈夜舉行會談，當經決定於六日前往中共軍區宣化店視察，並另由陳謙（政府代表），宋時輪（中共）及伊內德（美方）三民組織特別小組，分往中共宣稱之衝突地點調査實况。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口六日電〕徐永昌代表王天鳴（行營參謀長），中共代表周恩來，美方代表白魯德及隨員，記者等一行六十餘人，六日晨八時半由漢分乘吉普車十輛，前往宜化店視察，三氏預定七日即可返漢，惟陳宋伊三人所組特別小組，則擬暫留該區，並分往黃陂及應山·安陸等地調査，就記者與三方代表接觸所得，情形似不如外傳之嚴重。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口七日電〕中共代表周恩來，調處部美方代表白魯德，政府代表徐永昌代表武漢行營王副參謀長天嗚等，率領隨員曁漢市各記者一行四十餘人，六日由漢啓程赴中共中原軍區宣化店視察，以沿途公路橋梁多有毀壞，常晚僅能行至河口，七日始達宣化店。又悉，共軍李先念部在漢存款近復提出五千萬元，於五月六日由九小組共方羅參謀乘武漢行營所派汽車押運宣化店。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日專電〕確息，赴漢調査鄂中實况之三人小組委員會白魯德，徐永昌，周恩來等一行，定九日前返京。聞鄂中國軍從無圍殲共軍企圖，但爲保障交通安全，維護人民生命財產，警備甚力，共軍爲擴軍便利計，曾重提移軍五河之要求，而五河人民聞訊後，深慮共軍到達雞犬不寗，屢派代表向政府呼籲，誓死反對，並要求驅逐共軍離鄂。現鄂中共軍之行爲，已爲湖北人民所痛惡。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕蔣主席七日下午四時，在勵志社舉行茶會，招待到京國大代表，到陳其業等三百餘人，吳鐵城·吳鼎昌。陳立夫·邵力子·張道藩·雷震，洪蘭友等均出席。蔣主席蒞會時，全體代表起立鼓掌歡迎，主席頻頻含笑點首，並對各代表遠道來京表示慰問之意。奚玉書代表首先發言，感謝主席招待盛意，並對中央一貫主張還政於民與實施憲政之決策，表示擁護，繼謂：政府爲謀和平建國，故一再容忍與各黨派協商，但容忍應有限度，吾則人民實不堪忍受其痛苦。集認爲欲速決常前國內紛爭與制定憲法，唯一之途徑，即爲從速召開國大。繼由陳立夫代表發言，渠贊同奚氏從速召開國大之主張，並歷述山東等地連年遭受日寇及共軍荼毒情形，已使人民陷於水深火熱之中，言下極爲悲憤。方少雲代表指出，當前國家之危機及共黨行動，實影響和平建國大業之進行，方氏感謝蔣主席領導全國軍民爲國家民族爭取獨立自由之功勳，引導全體代表起立致敬。綢稱：今當獲得抗戰勝利之後，全國人民必矢其忠誠，絕對擁護政府與領袖，故盼政府對各黨派之空忍有其限度。渠以爲，與其一再恊商，延宕時日，　寗早日召開國大，以處理當前問題。詞畢，何冰如·陳亦修·丁宣孝·朱惠清等代表相繼發言，僉盼政府速即解除山東人民痛苦，早日定期召開國大，以制定憲法。蔣主席於聆取各代表意見後，說明政府延期召開國民大會之原因，略謂：各位代表爲參加國民大會，　　跋涉來京，這一　爲國家盡責任，爲人民謀幸福的至誠，使本席十分感動，政府對於各位的要求，於理於法都不能拒絕，自應該立即實行，不過大家都知道，我們這次國民大會之職責，乃是要制定憲法，奠定國基，而求得國家的安定與統一，以減輕人民的痛苦，使我們中國能從此走上現代民主國家的軌道。今天在應的各位代表，一定人人都抱定了這個遠大的目標，但正因爲這個緣故，所以我們政府在事實上不能不審察國家的利害與人民的安危，作周到的準備，以期召開大會，能獲得圓滿的結果。如果我們開會以後，既不能促成國家的統一，又不能解除人民的痛苦，反而使國家的危機更深，人民的痛苦加重，這就違反了各位代表此次來京集會的目的了。主席繼謂：「我深信各位是代表着全體人民眞正的意志，政府無不尊重各位的意見，使國民大會能儘速舉行，同時，亦望各位了解政府此次不得不延期的苦衷，並望始終一致與政府共同努力，來完成我們國民代表大會建立三民主義新中國的使命」，主席詞舉，各代表全體一致表示竭誠擁護，五時四十分散會。</p>

<p>撲滅華北蝗卵　執行部正進行恊商中</p>
<p>〔本報北平七日電〕全國災荒聲中，執行部正擬以協商與合作之方式，撲滅增加災荒嚴重性之華北蝗卵，今日執行部政府參謀長蔡文治，應農林部之請，與美方委員饒伯森作初步談商，尙未與中共正式討論。據農林部所提供之地岡，指示華北有四區城爲蝗蝻之孳生之溫度，其區城爲（一）河南新黃河區域，其地北起黃河北岸之孟縣，東循迄豫東之淮陽，爲一帶形區域，（二）魯西區域，以金鄉一帶爲中心，旁及蘇北，豫東之一部，（三）冀南一幣以邱縣，平鄉爲中心，（四）由冀東　潤一帶迤選至山東利津，黃河口之海岸地帶，並以天津爲中心，向西南伸展至保定一帶，上述區城爲北軍控制，故農林部方面擬商請中共派員赴谷區撲滅蝗卵，以免由蝻變蝗，增加今年災荒嚴重性。</p>
<h3 id="c14">瀋陽浮彫 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 方仁寄於瀋陽</p>
<p>瀋陽充滿了北平情調，山海關在北平與瀋陽之間，阻隔了兩地，使兩地稱爲關裏與關外，但就我在兩地住的經騐來說：兩地相異之點少，相同之點多，相異之點在於口音與方言，相同之點在於建築與若干生活習慣。</p>
<p>自然，我不能否認，北平畢竟是北平，瀋陽終於是瀋陽。就歷史上說：北平有着悠長的建都歷史，其間包括了淸朝，名稱上且只有燕京，北京，北平等等的稱呼。而潘陽，只不過是自愛新覺羅氏由吉林南下，設置了漸陽中街，入關之後，始稱爲盛京，後稱爲奉天，民國十七年十二月東北揚起了靑天白日旗，翌年一月，改奉天省爲遼寗省，省會所在地的奉天，正名爲瀋陽。九一八之後，日本人又把瀋陽改爲奉天市，遼寗改爲奉天，八一五以來，瀋陽當然還是瀋陽，雖然東北三省被改劃成了九省，而歸結爲一句，潘陽只是隨着淸朝興起而新典起來的一個都市。就實際情形說：潘陽並沒有使人洗連忘返的三海，也沒有迷人的昆明湖和醉人的萬壽山，然而，在潘陽，假使在遊過了北平，長春，哈爾濱之後，總要令人想到，縱然身在東北的瀋陽，苦干地方使人不期然而然有感，彷彿是置身在古色古香的北平。</p>
<p>瀋陽街頭，確實難以碰到像北平的那些，雍容自得慢條斯理的遊人，也少見樸素大方爲人稱道的北國胭脂。同時，既不像長春那樣，有幾條街道，幾乎完全現代化，高樓大厦，立體建築，滿眼一新，又不像哈爾濱那樣，南崗一帶，富於歐洲景色，道裏中國大街，飽具上海風光。但是，在街頭走走，總使人想到，瀋陽是充滿了北平情調。</p>
<p>當在城裏會蘭亭洗澡的時候，自然直覺的使人以之和北平的淸華園比擬，常在北市塲內中原公司裏觀光，人由不得不想到北平的東安市塲和西單商塲。長春就沒有北平淸華園似的澡塘，我想，這或許是因爲長春以往是東北的政治重心，而住在長春大建築裏的人，以往就用不着離開建築各沐浴，所以，南關東興浴室之類的澡塘，只有在那種不振的狀熊中，維持其電奄一息的存在。哈爾濱也沒見過有什麽闊氣的澡塘，有之，設備亦屬普通，倒是潘陽與北平彼此輝映，一有會蘭亭，一有淸華園，而兩地澡塘設備齊全之不謀而合，正可以說明兩地人士生活狀况和生活習慣之相去無幾。尤其是有一點我覺得和北平相似，那便是會蘭亭裏的那位老修脚師，在五十二歲的高齡之下，他在會蘭亭中，已經整整幹了三十六年。在暖室中以修脚消磨掉了他的靑春，消磨掉了他的壯年，他的晚景，仍將旦旦而伐之，消磨在暖室以內，爲人修着十個脚指。他那「達人」知命，知足常樂的表情，正和北平澡塘中飯館裏那些夥計的表情一模一樣，統屬於一個類型。</p>
<p>在城中可以見到金碧輝煌的淸時建立的皇宮，皇宮前面街上，樹着和北平類似的脾樓。而東陵的松蔭，北陵的柏林，蒼翠蓊鬱，和北平的太廟又有什麼兩樣，登臨其間，誰不覺得恍若置身在北平，提起柏林松蔭，儘管東北是廣出森林的地帶，人們誇說：「林木蓊鬱，日月爲之虧蔽，懸葛垂蘿，風烟不能川入」，但在市區範圍以內，像瀋陽有松蔭柏林者，還不多覯。這裏要附帶一句掃興的話，那就是東陸的松蔭，近被砍伐得非常厲害，二十九小組政府代表郭琦少將，前曾一度由撫順回到瀋陽，且擊松樹被砍的情形，見了我時說：「那些砍樹的砍得眞兇，絡繹不絕，都是滿載而歸，雖然松林很大，但經不起那樣無情的砍伐，看到了，眞呌人心痛」！他向我說完，急切又表示：「你們新聞界，應常說話制裁」！我感動，我向有關機關當局，說出松林被遭踐的情形，請他們趕緊設法防止。這裏我還願意提到它的原因，據我的看法，這一類的事，將來恐還會不斷發生，政府當局實在應當注意，應當使砍樹的人，瞭解到這是遠法丢臉，並不是爭光佔便宜。（下接第二版）</p>

<p>〔中央社記者劉竹舟潘陽七日電〕記者於經歷二十七日之驚險，絕望及隱匿生活後，卒已脫離共軍竊踞下之長春，而於五日下午五時安抵潘陽，在此一自由天地中，追憶過去之艱苦處境，恍如一塲惡夢。記者係於二日晨五時在共軍之嚴密搜索下，偕同夫人喬裝吿別長春，旅程無分晝夜，共行三百六十五公里，沿途曾爲共軍盤詰七次，另有三大重要關卡，係繞道通過，未被共軍發見。記者現須鄭重聲明，余始終未爲共軍所俘，前傳余與美記者五人及中央日報邵愼之，新聞報趙世洵二君，在共軍監視下同居一處之說實悮。</p>
<p>共軍砲擊長春</p>
<p>十四日共軍正式進攻長春前，余與邵趙二君同居滿炭大樓，次日戰况趨緊，邵趙二君移往五美記者下榻處之外交特派員公署，與趙君　市長同處，余則遷居防守司令部所在之中央銀行大樓，準備接受共軍之最後攻擊。迨後行營及其他各單位文職人員，亦紛紛遷居該行。眞面目之戰鬥，連續歷時五日四夜，共軍擁有向所未見之坦克車及重砲等，其兵力火力，均遠較守軍優越，守軍所據之各大建築物，爲大陸科學院。國務院。市政府。東拓大樓等，均先後被擊起火，此外遭砲擊焚燬者，尙有福順厚。天興福兩製粉廠，及裕易源製米廠，此三廠均爲長春擁有數十年歷史之大規模生產機構，中行大樓所中砲彈最多，會三度起火，因建築特固，均自行熄滅，惟所有門窗玻璃，悉被擊破。</p>
<p>越牆攻入後院</p>
<p>十八日午，共軍自西北面越墻攻入該行後院，雖經劉德薄副司令親自督戰，將之消滅，然頹勢已成，無可挽回，乃決定於人暮後突圍。惟未至日落，共軍即在砲火掩護下攻至樓外，前後門均遭熾烈之火網封鎖，在此千鈞一髪之際，陳家珍劉德薄及其幕僚衛士等，首先自銀行之東便門躍出，立有數人被擊倒地，其後諸人見狀，已不敢外出，時記者被夾於人業中停滯約三分鐘之久，嗣聞有人高喊「向後轉走後門」，記者乃擠出人叢，向後門急馳，至是見門外大火熊熊，已無法衝出，時若干士兵猶憑窗向外射擊，而間有槍彈則自窗口飛進，旋即有人連呼「弟兄們別打啦」，「中國人不打中國人」。余知此等語句之後果爲何物。</p>
<p>最後據點被佔</p>
<p>乃急轉身躍入地下二階之電汽房內，數分鐘後，此守軍最後據點之中央銀行大樓，即爲共軍佔領。余在電汽房匿跡四十小時之久，卒於二十日晨十時化裝電汽工人，逃出虎口。此後即改裝商人，隱入民家。當余繞道來瀋途中，會見有大批商賈，往返長潘間，販運貨物，南來者多運荳汕及酒類，北往者則販運棉花食品等，出入共軍關卡，均經嚴格檢査，並課以百分之廿過境稅。記者於離長之當日午前十一時，曾遇韓籍共軍四名，攔路抓車，同行商民驅車落荒逃遁，記者所乘之車，曾遭一韓兵持槍追擊，幸以高速度逃脫其射程。</p>
<p>脫逃途中所見</p>
<p>此後之三日行程，復見有甚多之韓籍農民，在公路兩旁稻田內，從事耕作。據同車鄉民言，在僞滿時代此等韓人中敗類之行徑，與日人無殊，甚或過之，彼等所耕之地，率係強行購買或覇佔者。日本投降後，彼等懼鄉民報復，紛紛逃去，現以共軍中有彼等之同胞，乃復先行歸來，又當長春淪陷時，共軍曾百般搜尋兩人之下落，其一爲中行經理韋錫九氏，另一即爲記者，韋與記者原居一室，十八日突圍時始於混亂中分手，韋與其會計主任徐君，曾一度被俘，旋即設計脫險，現亦到　潘陽。共軍之搜尋黨氏，係欲迫其開庫　歉，　尋者記之用心，非本人所知，然其意決非出於關心余之安全。（完）</p>

<p>— 方仁寄於瀋陽</p>
<p>（自第一版接來）</p>
<p>說來偌大潘陽，在有些小事情方面，眞令人有啼笑皆非之感。譬如說：我等去訪徐箴主席，坐的馬車，車夫鬧不淸省府的大門究在何方，驟巧，路旁有一個警察派出所，我們只得請敎警察先生，那警察吿訴我們說：「進了那個門，那前面的一座高樓就是」。我們跑進了那座門，門裏只有一片廣塲，而並沒有任何門通到前邊那所大樓去，只得折轉身出來再請敎，他說：「你們翻過了那段短牆就行了』。我們都不禁感到默然，翻牆訪人，從無此說，尤其是以一位警察先生向我們指示迷途，竟能口授如此妙法。再譬如說：馬路不平，草行其土，直能顚破人的屁股，而到處是垃級，眞不曉得瀋陽城何日　能修淸潔整齊，馬路什麼時候纔能够補修得平坦。這且慢說，何時纔能使爭先恐後的馬路三輪，懂得偱序而進的規矩，懂得你搶我搶，而路面有限，擁塞在一起，不但有欲速則不達的可能，同時還有肇禍的危險。瀋陽，也許是整個東北，在日本帝國主義者鐵蹄之下，一口氣不喘的壓榨了十四年，這一種桎梏，是有毒的，是違背人性的，但八一五以來，八個月的時光，桎梏雖然被解脫，在放任中，在失業無所擠　的生活情况之下，眞有若干人，茫茫無所適從。什麽是對的，爲我就是對的，爲我目的如是，但結果是否如　以償，眞正能够爲我？神而明之，眞是悲哀！</p>
<p>潘陽戒嚴時間縮短了，從二十六日起，每天下午八點半開始戒嚴，翌晨四時半解嚴。這通命令之下，使市內各舞　——日本美女們烘托得春意融融的舞廳，營業時間延長了兩小時，原先是五點鐘關門，現在改成了七點。而市內的電源還未得到全部解決，多半個多半個市區，全隨着日落西山，而睡在夜神黑暗的羽翼之下。就是我寫此文的現在，也只全　了一議孤燈。舉目看着玻窗外面的夜空遠遠的一　高聳的洋房。浮出亮晶品的燈光，我看久了，它不再像是一幢洋房。而是茫無涯際大海中隨海水浮沉的一　大船，在夜空裏閃　浮動。</p>
<p>瀋陽治安隨日而增穩固，但是，談起接收工作，若干地方，實在難令滿意。我們在京滬平津犯的錯誤，難通在東北還要來一次？東北是一個病體，談不上恢復健康，我們得細心經意的對付，吾則，殘酷的歷史，又會給我們以敎訓，我這由長春歸來心上懷着創傷的人，我實在不忍，潘陽，東北，再犯以往的錯誤！（四月二十七日晨三時。）</p>

<h3 id="c29">停戰一年後的歐洲 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>納粹乞降，歐洲停戰，到如今整整的一年了。這一年來，歐洲的人民，特別是德國的人民，從他們飽經砲火洗禮的城市裘喘息過來，可以不再嗅到火藥的氣味：和平算是恢復了，整個歐洲，瘡痍滿目，經濟上，沒有一個國家不感到嚴重的危機，政治上沒有一個國家，除了戰勝的英國和蘇聯以外，不感到動盪不安，社會上也沒有一個國家不感到失去平衡。然而在經過這樣一次凶惡的戰事，復員重興，原非短時期內所能立辦；這一年的時間，多少使歐洲的人民開始走向復興的大道，固然這條大道是漫長的。現在歐洲停戰雖已一年，作爲戰後歐洲和平基石的和的還有待於商訂，過去一年的和平，是停戰下的和平，對於歐洲持久和平的建立，尙有待於此後的努力。希特勒及納粹主義是擎潰了，戰後歐洲的輪　，也大致可以看得淸楚，戰後的默洲是怎樣一個歐洲呢？</p>
<p>莫斯科無疑地已爲歐洲的重鎭，決定歐洲乃至全世界命運的，不是倫教，不是巴黎，乃是在東歐的莫斯科。柏林是毁滅了，羅爲是只有敎宗發出來的光輝，　能照明各處的人心。歐洲停戰徒一年的今日，整個東歐，自芬蘭經波蘭捷克斯拉夫以迄南斯拉夫以東的歐陸，如今全在蘇聯的掌握之中。這已是個既成事實，然而蘇聯對擴張它勢力的企圖，依然不曾罷休。多得卡尼斯羣島要讓予希臘，屈里也斯脫要改隸南斯拉夫，意屬北非東非要委託蘇聯治理，蘇聯堅定而一貫的政策是要擴張，擴張到亞德里海，到地中海，到印度洋，在遠東的擴張，我們如今且不提。整個東歐如今都變了蘇聯的附庸了；但蘇聯還要在各處擴張，以確保它的「安全」。四强外長會議爲了草擬和的，既在倫敦不歡而散，如今在巴黎召開已逾兼句，迄未成立協議，除了希特勒及納粹主義已被擊潰外，這戰後的歐洲，與戰前的歐洲，畢竟有些什麽兩樣？</p>
<p>在整個歐洲幾爲共產主義席捲而去的今日，只有英法兩國允復高擎火炬，爲保衛歐洲文明的堅强壁壘。今日的法國雖以左派政黨爲中心組織政府，然而法國的左派，除了共產黨以外，都屬於溫和的改良主義，與英國的工黨同樣，雖標榜社會主義，却並不同情共產主義，更何况在左派政黨以外還擁有三分之一選民的代表天主敎勢力的人民共和黨。這次第四共和國憲法提付人民表決，竟遭到了吾決，更足以表示法國人民的穩定趨向，並不以左派政策爲然。凡此徵象，在動盪不安的歐洲均有種鎭定作用。在一個眞正民主的國家，在一個民權發達的國家，人民的公意是不能偽造的，他們不需要共產主義；祗有在民權不發達的國家，如保加利亞等，纔可以製造民意。戰後英國工黨政府的成立，以及法國左派政黨的失勢，實爲歐洲政局的一種穩定因素。</p>
<p>戰後德國的人民當然要償付他們掀赴戰事的代價。現在已不再有德國了，德國已瓜分爲蘇美英法四個佔領區。蘇聯的佔領區包括有戰前德國的大部，實是德國的心戰：在那裏蘇聯正在扶殖德國人民的更生；美國務卿貝爾納斯所提的四强公約亦遭到了蘇聯的反對。共產主義的祖宗原是德國人的馬克斯和恩格斯；此後德國局勢將如何演變，　關係整個世界的前途。它是否以另一姿熊遂行它傳統的向東伸展的國策，還是趨向西歐文明的懷抱，這在目前固然言之過早，聯合國曾有占領德國二十五年乃至五十年的計劃，然而今日的設施，可以影響到將來的演變。德國的將來依然是一個謎。</p>
<p>饑　籠罩整個歐洲，道原是戰後不可避免的現象，在餞饉的狀况下，歐洲的人民那能顧到政治上的顏色，善後救濟，因此，也帶上了政治的意義。要使歐洲免於饑饉，人民纔能開始有自我的覺醒。停戰一年後的歐洲，人民還在困苦中輾轉，他們在希望得到衣。得到食，他們在憧憬着戰後的和平。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦七日廣播：四强外長今晨舉行會議，討論羅馬尼亞和的問題，當經同意將外雪爾凡尼亞省歸還羅國。按該省曾由希特勒「奉贈」與匈牙利。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎六日電〕四强外長明日舉行全體會議時，將捨棄義大利和的問題而討論巴爾幹問題。四强外長次官所擬定之議程，首先討論羅馬尼亞和的，包括外雪爾凡尼亞之未來地位，其他邊境之劃定，及多腦河航行管理問題等項。芬蘭和的顯將留待日後討論。其他較重要之討論事項如下：（一）保加利亞之邊境及賠償問題；（二）外雪爾凡尼亞歸屬匈牙利之修正或廢止，匈牙利與羅馬尼亞之國界，北部邊境及可能之賠款等問題。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦七日廣播：伊朗外長已通知安全理事會，謂：蘇軍已全部退出伊境。但據英國廣播公司特派員自伊京來電，亞塞爾拜然省蘇軍仍未撤竣。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社七日紐的電〕聯合國安全理事會前經決定，伊朗與蘇聯兩國政府應於本月六日以前，以伊朗境內蘇軍撤退情形，提出報吿。迨至六日午夜止，伊朗及蘇聯任何一方，均未提出完全報吿。據伊朗駐美大使阿勒本日通吿聯合國機構秘書長賴依，謂蘇聯軍隊正自伊朗各省撤退之際，伊朗政府無法就此事提出報吿。伊朗大使此項聲明，係以該國負責官員所作調査報吿爲根。通吿書續稱：伊朗政府經由間接方面得悉：亞塞爾拜然省之蘇軍撤退工作，將於本月七日以前完成，但此一消息，不能由伊朗官方視察員加以證實，蓋伊朗政府自一九四五年十一月七日起，即不能在亞塞爾拜然省行施政權，此層早經報告安全理事會，自是以來，伊朗政府從無機會證實該省之眞實情形。伊朗政府希望採取各項步驟，以結束伊朗事件，但此際對於前途發展如何，尙難逆料，一俟伊朗政府確定亞塞爾拜然省實情之後，即當向安全理事會提出報吿云。據接近安全理事會人士談稱：伊朗大使此項通吿，證明蘇軍自伊朗撤退屬實，此舉或足使安全理事會將伊朗問題剔出永久議程。蘇聯方面若能就此事提出同樣照會，必將使蘇聯代表團之任務大爲輕鬆，抑此種照會非但無損蘇聯之尊嚴，反而能使安全理事會未來各項決定，增加效力。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯以前聲明不再參加關於伊朗問題之任何辯論，但一般人均望其在八日安全理事會開會之前提出報吿書。</p>
<p>〔聯合社德黑蘭六日電〕此間某高紀外交官今夜招待記者稱：據非正式報吿，紅軍正在急遽退出亞塞爾拜然省，今夜似可撤退完畢。英國官員昨夜由大不列士乘飛機抵此，據稱：該處紅軍昨曾舉行臨別檢閱，旋以卡車一百八十輛及戰車二十輛爲前導，開出城外而去。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎六日電〕法國新憲法軍案，經公民投票吾決，左派集團已遭受意外失敗，此項憲草即當廢葉，或由六月間另行選出之制憲議會澈底修正。各殖民地投票雖尙有未報吿者，但其爲數無幾，不致影響現在結果。預料法國政局在此次公民投票後將無甚變動，惟共產黨曾謀與社會黨加緊聯合，此舉自在意料之中。兩黨對新憲草雖一致擁護，惟社會黨曾數次拒絕與共產黨合併組織聯合政府，此時復已拒絕與共產黨作共同運動。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕倫敦政治觀察家認爲法國前日之反對憲法草案，貽欲排斥共產黨，使之不獲再領導政府，以免形成「赤禍」之結果。故一院制之新憲法，近在公民投票中反對之票數竟達一百萬餘票之多，殆可視爲「反共之公民投票」之。</p>

<p>〔路透社開羅七日電〕據今日發表之文吿稱：英政府頃建議所有英海陸空軍將退出埃及，並將與埃及政府根據盟約，商討在戰時或受戰爭歲脅時互相協助之措施。英國與埃及各以平等地位相處，鞏固聯盟，此乃英政府之已定政策。今爲遵行此政策，英埃談判現已在融洽空氣中開始進行。英國並建議在談判中，商定英軍撤退之程序及日期，其正式談判將於星期四開始。英軍退出埃及，乃一較爲簡單之軍事問題，但保衛中東之整個問題，乃一重大事件。專家相信英軍將採取逐步撤退之計劃，俾埃及能有增强其兵力之時間，並使其能有新式之科學武器爲止。且國際軍界人士亦承認英軍退出埃及後，埃及在地理上將成爲保護蘇　士運河區之主要國家，而埃及軍隊之軍械及作戰技術，又較英軍爲落伍，故英軍在撤退期內，需將埃及軍隊加以訓練改組，且在緊急時，將容許埃及有要求英國予以協助之權利。今埃及總理薛特基亦在勸導人民，應顧及埃及重要之戰略實情，勿要求英軍即行撤退云。</p>

<p>以飛虎英雄著名於世之陳納德將軍，自前月來華，至今已兩月有餘。渠來羣目的，志在重做一番事業，惜以籌謀未成，各方受阻，兩月以來，雖計劃甚多，但未能如願實行。年已五十之陳將軍，對此頗感消極沮喪，已於昨晨悄然離滬，逕返美京。臨行前曾接見中央社記者，對於離華原因，堅不發表。問其是否再行來華，亦未置答。各方對於陳將軍之突然離去，無不表示詫異與惋惜。按陳氏最初來華，原擬再度召其飛虎隊舊員，重整旗鼓，組織航空運輸隊，　曾對記者稱「此次來華將赴谷地考察，工作計劃未定」，但一般人推測，陳氏可能組織商業性之航空綫。惜以問題多端，竟未實現。又曾一度傳說陳將軍助我訓練空軍，但亦成泡影。最近聯總行總曾謀與陳氏合作，組航空運輸隊，利用空中運輸，將救濟物質運往各災區，尤以藥品救濟爲主要目的。蓋藥品量輕，空運至爲適宜。美賑災特使胡佛氏來華時，對於陳氏之計劃，極爲贊同，並促各方助其實現，以補水陸運輸之不足。但各方一再磋商，仍未能依計實行，陳氏以所謀不成，乃於昨晨吿別中國。陳氏返美原因，未予發表，聯總與行總對陳氏之離華，亦未發表意見。按陳氏在抗戰前，在抗州助我訓練空軍，一九四一年組空運志願隊，來華參戰深得蔣主席夫婦之鑽許。一九四二年奉美政府令，將志願隊改組爲美第十四航空隊，擴大組織，在大後方各地區設基地，予日敵空軍以迎頭痛擊。時內地民衆爲欽佩陳納德將軍空軍工作人員之豐功偉績，乃譽之爲「飛虎隊」威名　　中外。日人投降前一月，陳氏以故離十四航空隊返美，但其對相處八年之中國，眷念至深，乃於本年春初，自動再度來華，但壯志未成，今又以歸去聞。陳氏已於去年退役，仍保留美軍少將官階。</p>

<p>抗戰期間—紅十字會的救護隊與前綫忠勇將士比肩前進，甘冒敵人的砲火，不避危險，不惜犧牲，盡力達成救護任務；在復方紅十字會從事治療救濟的工作，廣立醫院診療所，預防疾病，指導衛生常識！這些廣泛的普及民衆的服務事實，也是惟一的神聖任務，中國紅十字在勝利的抗戰史上，留下了光榮的一頁，不可泯滅的一頁！</p>
<p>歷史悠久</p>
<p>已是四十二年前的事了，當光緒卅年日俄戰爭爆發的時候，本市耆　與英美人士，感到救護工作的需要，便集合力量，創辦紅十字會，於是本市產生了「外國紅十字會」，那時專任傷兵救　與治療工作，這便是中國紅十字會之前期。在歷年我國任何戰亂發生水旱。天災。風火。盜賊之後，以及疫癘疾病洗行之時，紅十字會無不見義所爲，擔任最迫切最重要的振濟和救護工作。至宣統年間，紅十字會的名稱把「外國」兩字，改爲「大淸」，直待武昌起義，國民政府成六後，「大淸」「紅十字會」才改爲現在的名字—中國紅十字會。那時仍本原來的宗旨始終爲人類謀福利。</p>
<p>輾轉內徒</p>
<p>「八一三」戰爭序幕揭開後，當砲火連天，國軍與同胞死傷枕藉之際，紅十字會的救護隊來了，他不避危險，不惜犧牲，在敵人砲火之中，檢林彈雨之下，從事救護傷兵的神聖工作。至廿六年十一月一日，感到上海環境特殊，隨着國軍西撤至南京，在南京成立了打破世界紀錄的「首都醫院」，院中有病床五千隻，繼續收容因抗戰而受傷的光榮的國軍，但當病床上只躺三千餘榮譽傷兵的時候，敵人的砲火，已跟踪着向南京進攻，於是南京也遭到倭寇之摧殘，紅中字會因此被迫痛心地離開了剛成立一月半之首都醫院，至同年十一月七日，將會址撤離南京，遷往漢口。其時、中國紅十字會總會副會長杜月座氏剛從上海至漢口，便在漢口舉行了一次重要會議，決定組織流動救護總隊，在化整爲零之原則下，將會中的醫師和護士，分成一百十餘洗動小隊，在彈雨槍林下，爲國軍服務。廿七年十一月一日，紅十字會又被迫搬到長沙。同年十一月，隨國軍西退祁陽，因祁陽設備簡陋，救護工作無法展開的緣故，遂於廿八年三月初，撤至貴陽。同時總會也於香港設立總辦事處，後因環境迫逼，終於遷至重慶，總會也於重慶成立。</p>
<p>救死扶傷</p>
<p>民國廿八年五月三日與五月四日，敵機飛往重慶，　拖轟炸時，同胞死傷枕藉，慘不忍睹，紅十字會便堅起紅十字大旗，繼續救護工作，如此直至卅二年春，在服務員努力之下，重　便有了一所唯一完備的救濟醫院，同時又成立了診療所。在此時期，重慶總會　淪陷區各分會之聯擊，業已失却，然在後方各地，則已樹立了分會九十八處，救護工作終於順利地進行着。</p>
<p>擴大服務</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，政府展開了復員工作，紅十字會也響應復負，而遷至南京，最近業已與各地分會恢復聯緊，並在海格路與新閘路成立醫院兩所，日前又在上海分會（新閘路八六五號）成立診療所，專爲貧病服務。爲擴充業務與爲人類服務之目的，決於本月十日展開會員徵募大會，並請錢市長大鈞担任總隊長，徐寄廎·王曉籟二氏，祖任副總隊長。該會一本替人類服務的宗旨，積極進行市民保健工作，添設醫院與診療所，採取醫療巡迴制度，免費注射防疫針，展開衛生指導與健康檢査工作。並爲應付社會念切需要，該會即將成立醫藥衛生訓練班，專門訓練衛生人才，服務社會，切實救濟貧苦同胞。</p>

<p>〔本報合肥訊〕皖敎育廳汪廳長少倫，於上月八日，應敎育部電召，赴京出席國立中等學校復員談話會，於二十六日返合。記者頃往訪汪廳長，承發表談話如次：</p>
<p>中學復員</p>
<p>抗戰初期，敎育部爲救濟戰區流亡後方失業靑年，曾創設國立中學多所，以收敎之。其第八第九兩中學，係爲本省流亡川湘失學靑年所特設。本廳爲使皖籍員生，得早返家園，於戰事初停，即爲其作回皖準備，一切遷回計劃與辦法，於本人奉令赴京之前，即分別厘定，並着手辦理。上月十五日在部開會時，僉認太廳所擬計劃與辦法，尙屬可行，並經決定將國立入中女生遷蕪湖，設省立蕪湖女中，皖北男生遷太和，設省立太和中學，皖中及皖南男生遷貴池，設省立貴池中學，九中女生遷安慶，設省立安慶女中，皖北男生遷宿縣，設省立宿縣中學，皖中及皖南男生遷東流，設省立東流中學，至八中鯽範部，則興茶灣師範皖範學生併遷當魚，設省立當飽師範，　立十六中皖籍學生悉數　銅陵。　省立　　　　。此外水利　　會在川所辦之水利工程學校，亦經決定遷設蚌埠。再據東遷之　立勞作師範，本慮業去電歡迎遷皖，設於蘇湖或　縣，以培養本省所需之小學勞作師資。所有隨校來皖敎職員，以分發上述諸校服務爲原則，如有餘額，再爲另行設法，使無失業之虞。</p>
<p>安徽大學</p>
<p>安大改爲國立，早經行政院核准，籌備委員亦經敎部聘定，於上月二十日在京召開第一次籌備曾，到會會員計有楊亮功。程演生。章友三。葉元籠。陶因。劉英士·劉眞如·王培仁。及本人。缺席朱光潛·高一涵。張忠道三委員。敎部翟主任秘書毅夫。馬科長小波列席。由杭次長主席，當經決定，該校暫設安慶原安大舊址。至永久校址，俟第二次會議，再行決定，暫辦文法·理·農。三學院，文學院設中文。西文。經濟。政治。法律五系，理學院設數學·物理·化學·生物四系，農學院設農　·森林二系，茶葉專修科一科。理農二學院，均自一年級辦起，文法學院各級同時開辦，其開辦費已核定五億元。該校於本年暑期後即行開辦。</p>
<p>小學敎材</p>
<p>本省小學，本期所需敎材，於未開學之先，本人曾親自赴滬，向七聯處洽購一百萬册，配給各縣，嗣並派督視導人員，分赴各縣督促籌款，逕匯該處，以便其照規定時日，將書運交備用。此次趁開會之便，赴滬一行，查詢購運情况，其款匯到七聯處，而書亦經運交，或由各縣直接派人携款領運者，計有懷寗。潛山。太湖·宣城。南陵·當塗。繁昌·寗國。巢縣·望江·靈璧。來安·太和·阜陽。懷遠·壽縣等十六縣。是項敎材，即上海亦早已照原定價二十四倍出售，而本廳代各縣所訂敎材，則仍照洽購待原定價十五倍出售，多數縣份未能如期匯款領購，致契的失效。其小學敎材，竟有以照原定價四十餘倍，向各地書肆購買，轉發學生者，如霍邱縣等學生負担，因之加重，殊堪惋惜云。</p>

<p>正因從前日寇完盤據的關係，滬大僅存了院舍的空壳，並且門窗不全，桌椅校具被刧一空，又因年久失修毁損不堪。這次遷回復校，重製了幾百只桌子，千餘只椅櫈，全部牆壁重新粉飾，幾千塊破碎的玻璃，一一裝配，衛生設備，亦佈置一新。這一筆費用，在目前高物價中，竟耗了國帶兩萬萬元以上。</p>
<p>住校的學生，的近一千，男女各半。宿舍中，都用雙層木牀，聽說這些木牀是從美軍當局以較廉的代價買來的，有幾個素來嬌養慣的學生，睏在上層牀上，感覺到旣不便利，又不舒服。因此，凌校長宣揚曾對學生們說：「美國自今次大戰後，因鑒於雙層牀可以增加宿舍容量一倍，所以美國各大中學亦都採用雙層牀。况且此番本校遷回復校，雖然規模粗具，可是費用已很龐大，假如住校學生分擔的話，每人須擬派國幣至二十萬元以上，但該款全由學校支付，住校學生不必負擔分文，所以學生們不該再有不滿意的表示。」</p>
<p>凌校長是一位英明的傑出人材，現年四十一歲，是最年輕的大學校長。他原任中央印製廠總經理，此次出任校長，一則爲了母校敦促，勉爲其難，二則他有他的見解，他說：「在抗戰期內，海外鈔劵供應斷絕，本人奉命印製鈔劵，並造紙及製墨等原料，以供自由區內戰時財政金融的需要，現在是復興建設的開始，國家需要的不是鈔劵而是人材，所以獻身敎育，聊盡樹人的微願。」凌校長雖歷淤宦海，但毫無官塲架子，在何一個學生，都可隨時謁見談話，尤其對於家境淸寒的學生，更想法替他們解決困難，使他們半工半讀，安心求學。</p>
<p>圖書館的書籍，幸而在抗戰開始時搶運妥　，最近已經撥回，共有圖書四百五十箱，其中不乏名貴珍本，許多工讀學生，帶了口單，忙着整理書籍，校方給他們的酬勞，是每小時三百元，以此貼補學膳費的一部。</p>
<p>大禮堂，係三層鋼骨磚石建築，內有座位一千餘，宏麗商皇，　與中上電影院相柏仲。該堂於戰前二個月方始落成，僅用過一次，當時造價入萬元，現在萬萬造不起了，校中建築，僅此一處，別來無恙，完好如初。</p>
<p>滬大內部尙有銀行與郵局的組設。銀行，由新華信託儲蓄銀行特約辦理。郵局，則由校方僱員專任其事，局內共有信箱近千，外面加蓋玻璃，學生們於散課後，可到郵局裏面檢視自己的信箱，有無信件，一目瞭然，此種設備，是仿照近代歐美一學校的，比較戰前更有進步。校中並已趕裝了電話，共有四根綫，都是屬於閘北交通部電信局的。</p>
<p>從前校內有許多樹木花草，綠蔭蒼翠，花香襲人，確是滬東的樂國，但是數年來被日敵砍的砍了，燒的燒了，一片荒凉，觸目驚心！聽說西敎授中，有想起這些可愛的樹木花草而竟至傷心流淚的，這是滬大不勝今昔滄桑的一點。</p>
<p>趁電車到楊樹浦底，還須走半小時，才到達軍工路上的滬江大學。目前交通工具，深感缺乏，該校自備汽車一輛，團體卡車二輛，往來行駛於圓明園路二〇九號該校城中區商學院至楊樹浦該校之間，接送敎職員與學生的往返。</p>
<p>據凌校長說：「去年八月下旬，日寇方機投降，本人奉命飛滬，在芷江時，曾奉何總司令的調令，着即接收本校，經過幾個月的努力，克服了種種困難，到現在總算初步完成，可是未來的發展，更待最大的努力，因爲滬大的損失，約在國幣十萬萬元以上，目前還僅做了一部分，偌大的費用，除請美國敎會補助外，更希望同學會方面多多捐助。」熱切期待而寄以樂觀的凌校長，現在正向着滬大復典的大道，邁步前進。</p>

<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦七日電〕英國國外貿易部大臣麥根德氏頃解釋英政府封閉利物浦棉花市塲繼續施行集體購棉一項，決定向聯合紡織工廠工人協會發表演說稱：英政府對集體大量購買棉花一事已予以久長而審愼之考慮。且無意變更此項對棉業界最有利益之決定，按利物浦棉花市場，包括二百家商業公司，係於十九世紀生長形成者。當時確爲一交易之媒介，及商情之供給者。惟目下情勢業已變更，在一九四一年前，甚多紡織業界人士，已不再依賴經紀人，自行設立購買處。在政府關閉利物浦棉花市塲之前，該市塲早已成爲一時代之錯誤矣。麥根德氏繼强調稱：戰後世界合理處置棉花之趨勢，較前愈益顯著。戰時之經騐，顯示棉業之管制，乃一偉大之成功。蓋一方確保棉花之大量供給，且有巨額之貯藏。政府棉業管制處已就廿一種不同種類之棉花價格，限定其漲落之價格。反對關閉利物浦棉業市塲者，謂此舉或可促使某一歐洲國家，建立此種市塲。惟據麥根德氏之意，認爲此乃不可能之事。麥根德氏承認關閉利物浦市塲在外匯方面或有輕微損失之可能，惟政府方面相信棉價之穩定及供應之正常，足爲擴展棉貨出口貿易之良好基礎。在貨幣觀點而言，較之小網之外匯損失，足以抵償而有餘。棉業管制處目下每年所經管之棉花，價達五千萬鎊之鉅，職員共計八十人。一且此事由購買委員會接管以後，其人數勢將增加。該委員會人選，則將由各方有關人士組成。價格之穩定，大量購買之經濟，將爲工業界重大之收獲。</p>

<p>— 本報漢口三日航訊　特派員周崖影</p>
<p>在甘霖紛霏，人們喜雨的時節，光復八月後的武漢，傳來一個渴望巳久的喜訊：『蔣主席今日飛漢轉京！』這眞如『大平望去霓霓』一旦獲得了霖雨普降，便使「病者以愈」，「憂者以喜」，人人流露着歡忭的情緒。</p>
<p>從廿七年十月廿四日　我軍在武漢轉進的前夕起，主席闊別武漢已七年多了，在這漫長的歲月裏，武漢民衆所遭遇的厄運，自然不堪回首，因為百廢待舉，建設維艱，敵人所加於我們的傷痕，依然是歷滕在目！就連顚簸不平的幾條大馬路，也直到蔣主席蒞漢的前夕，才由漢市工務局長　夜督工塡好。</p>
<p>但，物質上的殘破，阻遏了了精神上的滋長。今天國土重光，政府正在凱歌聲中浩浩蕩蕩地還都，人們從主席的英明與辛勤，展望　到和建設的遠景，却哪忘却了過去所受的創傷，在心靈上獲得無限的慰籍，幷從這內在的慰籍，發出了眞摯熱烈的鼓舞和感戴。</p>
<p>在　主席于蒞漢以前，此間當局幷未宣怖其蒞漢的確切時間。因此，從上午十時起，黨政軍要員和各界代表便已先後冒雨赴機塲恭候。特別是我們這羣擔任採訪工作的記者，雖然沒有得到入塲的通行證，也不惜千方百計，慌慌忙忙地追隨着要人們鑽進了飛機塲</p>
<h3 id="c131">時雨浸沐　感到分外溫潤 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>午後四時許歡迎人員已齊集機塲，排成三列。不巧時雨越下越大，除了幾位小姐帶着有花紋的小傘剛足蔽爾外，大部分的歡迎人員雖俄雨點酒得衣紗透濕，却仍不慌不　，井井有條地鵠立着，一個個和顏悅色，好像對這時的雨浸沐，感到分外的溫潤。尤其難得的，是剛從南京飛來的陳納德將軍，也不辭疲勞，趕來與我們同在一起守候。他除了略談物資空運隊的任務外，并懇切地對記者說：「我認識　蔣主席已好幾年了，他確是你們民族的巨人！」</p>
<h3 id="c132">雨息風停　專機徐徐降落 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>這樣，在機塲竚候一小時後，不久便雨止風息。主席隨員所乘的一架飛機，自雲層徐徐下降．接着，雄傳的「美齡號」機也着陸了。由一輛指揮車引領着向我們的行列駛來，大家便帶着緊張而愉快的心情，自動地肅立起來，機塲空氣顯得特別寂靜。</p>
<h3 id="c133">「你們累了」　主席表示謝意 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>

<p>稍停，主席夫婦登車駛往怡和村行邸。跟在後面的一百多輛小汽車，迤酒成帶。沿途市民，扶老携幼，夾道歡迎，爭欲膽仰　主席豐釆。當　主席乘車駛過時，羣衆鼓掌歡呼，聲震屋瓦。　主席揮帽示意，依戀地對武漢市民懷着無限眷念！大家恭聆「。聲欬」，看到　主席仍是精神弈弈，態度雍容，不禁為國家建設前途增加了光明的希望與信心。</p>

<p>— 本報廿八日廣州航訊　特派員梁風寄</p>
<p>在這個乾燥而悶熱的天氣裏，使人焦灼的事情委實太多了！如米價漲到每担六萬餘元，癘疫普遍地流行着，這使大家都不禁皺上眉頭，呈現着不安的情緒。不過，在這個苦悶的空氣中，倒有一宗使人稱快的新聞，就是曾被探吿貪污凟職的交通部珠江區航政獨長周演明，最近以五十萬元向兩廣監察使劉侯武行賄，而被劉監察使提出彈劾，並致函廣州地方法院檢察處將該局長拘押。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>說起這位周局長的來歷，本是不凡。他登同盟會會員，曾任大本營交通處處長，陳烱明主粵時，他任護沙統領，及後任交通部要職。抗戰期間，他曾在梧州任珠江航政局長，並任西江航業服務社主任，當時，他夜任內的弊端劣績，早已人言嘖嘖；光復後，航政局改為廣州航政局，周仍繼任局長，因當時航業最為鼎盛，周便憑藉勢力，勒索航商，利用發給所謂「准航單」機會，動蠟索款，達百數十萬元之鉅。及該局在廣州復員，改為珠江區航政局。復員以來，周利用職權，違法凟職，又為社會輿淪，指摘蜂起，人民到兩廣監察使署控吿該避無弊貪污的案件，有五宗之多。本年二月十六日，廣州航業公會籌補會籌備員朱克動等，曾聯名拎吿周貪污勒索，包庇漢奸等罪行；海員公會亦以該局辦理船員乎册，以一成本僅數百元之手册，而每一工人領取時，竟索取票款一萬元，船上大副二副之人員，尙勒收不祇此數，此顯係勒索無疑；同時，鹽業公會亦對該局橫征暴繳，貪污勒索之告訴事實，不下盈尺，所以兩廣監察使署接到了這纍纍的投訴，便不能不開始對這些案件作秘密調查了。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>正在調查進行之際，那位周局長所謂作賊心虛，認為這非疏通疏通不可，便於二月卄三日，親到劉監察使寓所，詢問調查事，並有求通融之意。當時劉監察使便說：本署調查分專查與普查兩項工作，此項普查，非專對航局，如無弊端，儘可放心，否則，旣有法院及審計處人員同往，他們亦可自行檢舉，本人即欲放鬆做人情，亦愛莫能助。周見劉監察使這樣說法，自然不好再請求了。</p>
<p>周走後兩天，這位周局長的太太陳覺非又到劉公館去，說她找劉太太，適劉太太剛出丑理髮，她便坐在那裏直等到劉太太回來；那時正是午飯時候，劉太太便邀她同餐，餐後周太太吿別，劉太太送她到門口，她便取出一大紙包，說有區區薄禮，送與監察使購買補品，劉太太隨即謝却轉身上樓，她又將紙包交與劉公館勤的務兵，然後乘車耐　粗。那勤務兵祇紙包送交劉監察使，當時打開一看，原來是法幣五十萬元，劉監察使便要劉太太將款退不，後來由劉太太查明周寓住址，親自將款送還，怎知周太太又以伴送劉太太回寓為辭，至中途下車，要購禮物贈送，劉太太又即謝却；那時周太太又將款取出，偏要劉太太收受，因在途中一送一却，恐惹人注意，正在推拒之下，周太太再將云消霧散交與劉太太隨從之勤務兵而去。劉監察使知道這種情形，認為不便再事寬容，於是先將該款交與出納對存，隨即赴高等試院親向史院長及張首席檢察官商談處理。這本來是二月間的事，但為什麽到現在才揭露呢？原因是劉監察使以該周局長被控各案，尙未調查竣事，若遽將行賄事即行糾舉，法院必會依法拘案，則對調查各案之進行不無影響的哩。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>這事情過了一個多月，也許周局長以為可以安然無事的了。不料四月十一日黃昏過後，法院檢察處派了檢察官汪舒龍等三員，率同法警六名，並會同憲兵四名，前往周寓拘捕周濱明，但當時查悉周已去跳舞，久候未回。至次日晨七時，全批人馬便又到航政局去，但周尙未返局，汪檢察官看見時機急迫，遲恐生變，遂即轉回周寓，時己九時卅分，還是大門深鎖，室中人似還未起床，汪檢察官便先帶領各憲警四圍埋伏，由檢察官謝耀欣敲門逕進，那時周太太聆聲出現，知事不妙，便推說周不在家，詎料那時忽電話鈴聲大晌，正是航政局的陳主任打來，想籉訴法院派人來找他，當時謝檢察官斷定周必在屋內，立即下令檢查，周太太竟不允被搜，互相便爭持起米，原來這位局長果在室內熟睡，聞聲驚醒，那時周還披着睡衣，出詢何事，當謝檢察官取出了劉監察使和法院檢察處的密令時，周不禁當堂變色，俯首無言，祇有穿回外衣，隨着謝檢察官而去了。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>周被捕後，法院對周行賄部份，曾提訊一次，周極力否認有其事。法院又傳訊周妻，而周妻竟狡辯所送與劉監察使之國弊五十萬元，並非賄款，不過當時劉監察使有病，故送給他作醫藥之用罷了。記者當天在法院者見周時，他那矮胖的身子，披上一套灰色薄絨西裝，鼻樑架着金絲眼鏡，臉上雖然現着紅光，但掩飾不了他徬徨不安的情緒；他一變胖脚，已經加上脚鍊，這一位堂堂局長，今竟瑯璫入獄，大槪有「早知如此，何必當初」的感想吧？</p>
<p>這事發生後，社會人士都非常注目，因為在粵省懲治芸芸貪官污吏之中，地位較高的還算這一位周局長哩！同時周本係國大代表，本省各國大代表對周的「公權」問題，曾開會討論，並曾派出丘昭文乖四代表，謁見法院的首席檢查官，請求將周案於國民代表大會之期前，予以辦結，否則暫准其保釋參加選舉後，再行辦理。可是法院認為周旣違背國民期望，被控貪污案件五宗，對於延期審理，實未便遽爾答復哩！</p>
<p>現在，周案行賄部份，已算偵查終結，並定四月二十七日公審了。在這世風日下的今天，剷除貪污，澄清吏治，已是全國人士一致的要求，所以這次周這被糾舉彈劾，亦訂算是人心大快的新聞吧。</p>

<p>以產米聞名的蕪湖市區，現下正在蛻變中，人口已由戰前十八萬增至二十七萬，而住宅似比戰前少，原因是損毀的房屋迄未修復。</p>
<p>皖省府刻於蕪湖設市政籌備處，以第二區行政督察專員張遐隊氏兼處長。張氏於古老的市政籌備處幽暗的辦公室灰沙發椅上，與記者漫談了一小時市政。從三十四年十一月，張氏　蕪湖起，迄至四月下　，共做了以下的事情：</p>
<p>（一）修　方一條環塘路，使得陶塘的四週有一條寬闊的馬路，可以供市民晨錯散步，欣賞風景。</p>
<p>（二）修平了全蕪較大的馬路及兩側人行道，並且在人行道邊沿，新栽了六千棵白揚，楊柳以及洋梧桐。他希望十年後這六千棵樹苗成蔭，在蕪構成一個綠色的美的圖案。</p>
<p>（二）修平並擴大了公共體育塲，在塲內重建了一個司令台，　閱兵以及民衆集會之用。</p>
<p>（四）在永電廠附近建築了一個中山紀念堂，用作蕪市官塲雅集之氣。</p>
<p>（五）令十三個鎭公所，每所修養一個合乎現代城市標誰的公厠。</p>
<p>（六）由義後救濟分署助款修築長河上的「洋橋」，溝通北岸市區與南岸米市的交通。為了使橋與馬路啣接，把橋址由原來的寗陽觀移下至迎江寺附近。</p>
<p>據張氏封記者云：目前蕪湖　察局已歸市政籌備處轄管指揮，市立醫院亦已由省劃交他正在　辦一個大圖書館。</p>
<p>在市政外表上，張氐所做的是非常得體，蕪湖一定訂以像張比的故鄕桂林一樣美化起來。這也正是蕪地人士一致期待着的。</p>
<p>不過，記者根據蕪地人士談稱：市政的軌跡，若是不把車點放在「民生」方面，就容易流於「瓶花」式的點綴。値此恢複生產，維護交通，發展商業的和平建設時代，市政與整個國家政策亦正需要緊密聯繫起來才好。　這問題自然超出一個市政籌備處範圍與能力之外，在糧食恐慌和米價高漲的情勢下。蕪湖市政似亦應針對日益嚴重的「民生」問題而實施有力的對策。（五月二日）</p>

<p>全台灣的公務員，現在都在飢餓　上掙扎．從內地來的都領有安家費，旅費，迫使他們「旣來之，則安之」，可中如今連「安之」，也成了問題。因為待遇的不能調整，一個委任官的官俸，至多二千元，僅數極簡單的個人伙食費，而交公署匯劃的安家費，去年十一月匯出的，到現在沒收到的還有很多，而三月間匯交台灣銀行上海辦事處的，却還欄灣，據說要辦手續。所以自己活不下，家屬活不下，表現在工作上的只是散漫，敷衍，因循，茍且。本省人一般的待遇較低，他們固已不滿意，而每天上午八時至十二時，二時至六時的辦公時間內，無公叮辦，悶得要死，而較遠的更不能及時返家，他們說日本人的夏季辦公時聞是合理的，於是一表的不負責任，敷衍了事。</p>
<p>兩局長的自殺</p>
<p>前兩個月嘉　的一個局長自殺了，最近高雄的警察局長自殺了，都患同病：貧血沒有錢〞中華日報社論，「安安公務員的心」文內說：「相信大多數公務員身上，都可以搜出家人的催款書」，結語是：「要改營本省政治，首先要設法安安他們的心！」一個薦任官對託者說：「我不及一個理髮匠，他每月可凈人六干元！」公署方面決定五月份起對　款改進了，可以用票匯或劃款，但只限於滬閩兩地，而接家眷也規定了辦法，直系覲屬四人以下各支川資費國幣五千元，至於官俸也將於五月份起調整。</p>
<p>言論絕不摧殘</p>
<p>陳長官在光復後首次新聞記者大會的演辭，他說：「我對言論界決不摧殘，絕對賦予自由。」結句是，「中國是整個的不容畸形！」此間金融界盛傳當局將不久發行新通貨，代替台幣，通行於本省轄境內，行見此一經濟眞空地帶又將現一新姿態！</p>
<p>本省人的民主</p>
<p>本省人現均高談「民主」，以「民主」為口頭禪。政府方面執行公事，碰到他恤們抵觸時，即答以此係「民主」，「民主」成了自私的護身符。</p>
<p>在省參議負選舉後，某有力公會，公開公開反對：「不是民主的民主」。</p>
<p>浪人們的暴行，是作為「民主」的行動的，公開的反對是「民主」的答復。民主的絕大的危機正是這些曲解「民主」者！。</p>

<p>到南京的時候，夜幕剛垂，回望下關江邊，似乎夜潮洶湧。載我們來的船，也漸漸隱人蒼茫中去。顯車入域，穿過挹江門，奔馳在平滑的馬路上，夜風迎面撲來，有點寒意。遙望城內星星燈火，如同在閃着歡迎的眼。</p>
<p>八年了！闊別這六朝的名城，時刻縈繞在夢魂中的山水，而今又攤在在眼前。山河無恙，此番歸來，中心實不勝欣慰與依戀。時光在不息地洗走，多少事物都已變換，而石頭城仍保持當年面目，使人憶想起什麽，但隨即又被一種倦遊歸來的興奮所掩覆。夜深時，倚枕聽巷外，賣夜食的人敲着小竹板踅過，我被這種然稔的江南情調所感動，默默沉思。</p>

<p>無論從那一方面說，南京現正從冷落走向繁榮。勝利後，曾經一度荒　，街上行人稀少，若干建築都貼上封條。而今山空中來的，由水上來的人，一天比一天增多，雖然由於運輸工其的限制，還都的人員每天到的數量也極有限，但是總在漸漸增加着。這批人彷彿是一股新血液注人了南京的每條通　要道，現在南京彷彿　沉睡中醒來。走在街上，可以看到熙熙攘攘的人流，其中大多是從重慶來的，肩上風塵未卸，就已　祥在寬闊的街道上，以　　的眼光來觀察這裏的一切了。過去封閉的許多房屋，現在是　　了，並且都已重加粉刷，煥然一新。</p>
<p>南京呵！你已經變成政治的中心，取重慶的地位而代之。各部首長已經陸續飛來，各機關職員也早已辦公，而四月卅四日翩然降臨的馬歇爾將軍，更表明南京在今後已成為全國人士視綫集中的焦點。</p>

<p>自四月二十五日起，已有不少國大代表趕來，並且在那一天開始報到。對代表們的招待是周到而慇懃的，食宿與交通老早就準備停當。其他不說，當公共汽車正吿缺少，乘咨擁機的時候，國民大會專車突然以一種新的姿態出現，是不能不使人注目的。車廂寬敞，應位舒適，由兩邊玻璃窗中望進去，自然容易產生種種幻想，不知將米的京市公共汽車有沒有進步到像國大專車的一天？據本市一家報紙上說，為了使國大代表們表示滿意，所有負責招侍的茶房工友們是受過一次專門訓練，免得失戰。現在國大在熱烈準備小延期了。但各地代表仍然絡繹而來，在這裏等待。巍然兀立在國府路上的國民大會堂，如今仍然空着。這座會堂，的確可稱為富麓堂皇，美輪美奐。內部設備且不說，就以作為陪樹的國府路上的三個大牌樓來說，就够得上「壯觀」兩個字了。國大的延期，似乎暗示着政治糾紛已步人一個新的協議階段，然而這幾天來，東北仍然是一片漆黑，南京的天氣雖然是爽朗的，可是人們心頭仍有　疊的陰雲吹拂不去。</p>

<p>市面的由蕭條而趨於繁榮，主要的刺激固素當然她還都與還鄕人士的源源而來。固然，那些在抗戰期中過着困苦生活的公務負與流浪者，購買力究竟如何還是一個很大的欵問，但是返京後怖置一個簡單的家庭，多少也需要一點什麽，同時想到以後生活漸趨安定，每個人要置備一些衣物，於是在初來的時候，總必在同店裏消費一點或多或少的金錢，而在另一方，少數發勝利財的人物，盡情揮霍，也無形中造成了某些方面的繁榮。每到夜晚，熱鬧的街市上，各色霓虹燈光芒四射，音樂悠揚，玻璃窗櫥前羣集着遠方來的人，在細細端詳。中央商塲，復興商塲裏摩肩接踵，川流不息。商人們競以「歡迎復員，九折優待」字樣。來招徠顧客。</p>
<h3 id="c146">房租奇昂　幾佔薪律大部分 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>隨着人口的增加，有兩個問題也跟着增加它的嚴重性：那就是屋荒和糧價。現在在南京找房子，困難情形不亞於當年在重慶。沒有房子麽？不會的。事實上還有許多房子閑空着。困難在沒有適當的門路，更困難的是沒有大量的法幣。租一間普通房子，起碼要五六十萬的押租，五六萬的行租，如果稍為像樣的房子，自然數借於此數。由內地蹄來的人們能祖負得起麽？當然無力負担的佔多數。每月的房租，幾乎就去了薪津的大半。以後還要養家活口，開門吃飯，這怎麽辦呢？</p>
<h3 id="c147">零件被竊　活動房子活動了 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>行政院預備給公務員建築的住宅，到目前為止，似乎還沒有離開計劃階段，何日動工興建，還不得而知，即使能在秋季造成，但遠水也救不了近火。前些時，聽說新從美國運來的活動房屋，就可在明故宮附近搭起，過了幾天，又聽說兩箱子的零件失竊，於是，活動房屋在未成功之前，就已「活動」了。至於食糧，它是民生問題的核心，現在也已面臨一個可怕的危機。當全國各地普遍鬧着　　，糧價飛騰的今天，京都之有食糧問題，自然不足為怪，但是絕不會如此嚴霸。明白地說，人為的不臧，實在是其中的主要因索，一方面食米的來源沒有暢通，著名的蕪湖雖然近在京做，但是那邊的米並沒有大量的源源而來，一方面由於還都人員的日漸增加，食米的需要也隨之增加，好商看準了這是個嫌錢的機會，從而囤積居奇，投機操縱。此外，還有一個不可忽視的因索，就是：就滬近在咫尺，滬上糧價的波動可能在京都發生影響。於是，糧價幅一萬七八而二萬五，再突破三萬大關，作直綫形的上升。</p>
<h3 id="c148">看商情表　重鉛壓上了心頭 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>南就市民們每天打開報紙，一斤商情表，不由得搖頭歎息。糧價是物價的指標，日用百貨也在隨糧價漸漸向上爬了，生活的威脅，宛如一塊粗鉛，壓上心頭，使人感到沉重。剛從重慶來的人對南京所生的美麗幻想，被現實擊成粉碎，他們都歎息着說：「我們來遲了！」</p>
<p>關於屋荒與糧價，日前仍在開會的京市臨時參議會也曾討論過，並且形成議程中精彩的節目之一，但是從討論到議決，由議決到實行，中間過程多，變化自然也多，所以沒有人敢相信臨參會的辦法會被行政當局百分之百地實行。臨參會在還都前夕舉行，意義是相當重大的。參議員們都感到南京旣為首都，一切建設都得做樣，並且接收從的許多問題，至今還得淸算，所以大家都有一種熱望，要求市政與今後耑要相配合，樹立一個現代都市的規模。</p>
<h3 id="c149">尊重民意　臨參會派得勝利 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>然而在開會期中，却有兩個諷刺畫面：某一是公共汽車增加車資，其二是糧價的扶搖直上。這兩件事的突然出現，簡直呌參議員們不能下台。大家斗然憤怒了。公共汽車是市營事業，不該做漲價的先鋒，一漲就是一倍。大家要求市府收回成命，不然的話，全體參議員辭職不幹，態度是相當强硬的。在這種情形下，市府為了尊重民意，也決定恢復四月廿一百以前的票價。關於糧食問題，參議會再三要求糧食特派員將存米七百萬石平糶應市，壓低糧價，這一要求也被答應了。料想最近的糧價，可望不再有激烈的波動。臨參會一兩天內便要給束了，參黨員們的確已替市民講了不少話，可是市民們希望不僅是把話說了而已，並且還要能以事實來安慰人心。</p>

<p>我常見有人坐在國父銅像下的石級上，抬頭凝望遙遠的雲天，聰他的口音，無疑義是從江北來。像這樣的人，正日有增加。勝利後十個月的今天，他們反不能在自己的家鄕安居樂業，不得不拋棄耕紜的田莊和經營的事業，逃亡出來，到了這生疏的京都，生活有着落麽？少數的人投奔了親友，苟延時日，大多數的人掙扎在　　綫上，呼籲無門。他們是毫無黨派色彩的平民，為了逃　赤色的恐怖與混亂，寗可在外鄕飄泊，不願歸去。在米珠薪桂的京市，怎能生活下去？據此問大剛報云：南京市六十萬人中，失業的就有二十萬。這個數字的正確性，固然待考，但至少指出事態的嚴重。大江以北繼續着混亂的局面，大江以南輾轉在生活綫上的流民便陸續增加。他們流落在金陵的街頭巷尾，北望故園．憶念室家，不禁掩面悲泣！</p>

<h3 id="c152">關於訓練「語感」 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>記得在一本討論作文決的書中，夏丐尊先生曾談到「傳染語感於學生」的一個問題。那篇文車，似乎沒有引起多少人的注意。現在很多人對於「新文藝腔調，認爲是語文上的嚴重的病態，覺得一般文囈作品，如果不把「新文藝腔調」去掉，從充實內容上致力，便有普　的走入「無病呻吟」的趨勢。學會語體文上慣用的形容事成物的　句，模仿一下語體文上慣用的描寫動興靜的陳語，那怕一點思想沒有，也會堆砌成裝點成一篇自以爲很像語體文的文章。</p>
<p>其實一篇好的文章，不管文言與話體，必須有內容，有不得不說的話要吐露，有不得不說的意思要表達，正如說話一樣（文章也是一種說話）。要將內心蘊藏的話向人家傾吐，希望兩方面起共嗚作用。因此，好文章的唯一條件就是眞切，要能如實地把思想和生活反映出來。文章是思想的記錄，生活的反照，單單浮淺地砌上一些陳言套語，裝上一些綺詞俚句，而沒有不得不說的話，不得不表達的意思，那決不能說是文章，更說不上好文章。</p>
<p>去年梁實秋敎授在重慶講「文章的僞裝」這個題目，他對寫文章應抱的基本態度，發抒了不少意見。他說近三十年新發展的新文藝，一方面是成功，一方面是失敗。他認爲失敗的地方在許多號稱「文藝靑年」之流的，把新文藝的創作，作爲一種幌子，對文藝寫作毫無一點修養，便會把許多新文藝中慣用的形容詞，堆砌而成所謂「文章』，滿紙是驚歎，是感喟，（不是通過眞實感情而發出來的驚歎或感喟。）而沒絲毫不得不說的話，不得不表達的思想。報紙的副刋裏，可以當常看到這一類沒有內容的作品。</p>
<p>梁敎授自然有他的見地，一新文藝腔調」之令人詬病也是事實。近三十年新文藝的發展，雖米到完全成功的地步，但至少牠已使藝術作品的內容與形式，更加接近現實，更加與生活發生聯繫。至於寫作的「新文鑒腔調」的病態，我們是可以補救的。我們不能因爲有這些缺陷，而遽然否認新文藝的價値、雖然同時我們也不得不承認「新文藝腔調」是語文上的一個嚴重的病熊。</p>
<p>「新文藝腔調」最大的病微，就是文字內容的空虛。有人說文章內容的充實與否，有關作者的年齡，生活與經騐，但我這裏所說的內容的空虛並不是這樣。要一個初中的學生寫關涉國計民生的宏論，自然不可能，可是他的年齡，生活與經騐儘管很幼稚很淺薄，然而他多少總有一些不得不說的話，不得不表達的思想，也就是說總有一點內容，即使內容比不上成年人那樣充實。見解比不上成年人那樣精闢。</p>
<p>要補救「新文藝腔調」病態的泛濫，我覺得只有採取夏先生的辦法，提高「語感」作用，以　補語體文上的「腐詞爛調」。我想無論是語，是句，他總得要表達一種意思。文字是由語和句迎綴而成，他一定是代表若干意義的符號，讀者對於這些符號的感受性各有不同，這是因各人的經騐能力的程度而異。正如聽一個人演講，或欣賞一輻盡一樣，各人的感受性部不同。同樣的一語，一句，有的人讀了只感受到他的量義一點點，有的能感受到較多一點意義，要能全部感受當然不是易事。學寫作的人，尤其是初學者，應該在語和句的感受上多下功夫，能够訓練成般銳的『語感，對某事某物某境某景，便可認識得更淸楚。理解得更透澈，體會得更深刻，感受得更充分。由心理上的「移情作用』自然而然的健自己寫作時所選用的語和句更加切當於所要說的話，適合於所要表達的思想。讓文字和所用以表達某種意義的符號之間構成一座橋梁，實在是訓練寫作的基本方法。</p>
<p>譬如說吧，「環境」一語，是常見的名詞，但有幾個人對牠的涵義有過深切的了解？即使了解，各人了解的程度也絕不一樣。讀過社會學，心理學，生物學，敎育學的人，和一般沒有學過那些科學的人所了解的程度便大有出入。你問一個小學剛畢業的學生他也許會回答你：「在我們居住的四週便是環境。—再有「空閱」「時問」每個人所感受到的意義也不一樣。「文化」和「生活」這兩語氣上去並不怎樣奇特，好像很普通，但普通學生能够澈底了解牠的意義的一定不多。如果把這兩語述在一起，成爲「文化生活」一語，那怕能了解其眞正的意義的更不多了。</p>
<p>不能完全或大部分了解一語一句的眞正的涵義，把握文字所代表的符號，如何會把牠切當的適宜的用到自己的寫作上來？看到「力」一語以爲是摩拳擦掌所生出的力，看到「善」一語以爲是不做壞事，那不是誤解了牠們或片面了解了他們。誤解的不必說了，就是正解，有時也決非全解，其所感受的程度必然很淺。對寫作時的選用詞句，也會發生同樣的誤解和片面了解的弊端，而使文字和所用以表達某種意義的符號不得眞切，適合，甚至格格不人。不當用「悽淸」的地方也用「悽淸」，不當用「交流」的地方也用「交流」，於是滿紙是「悽淸」「交流」，或者所用的形容詞，都是直接移用人家已用烱了的，自己不在腦子裏先經過一番感受或體會便隨便塞進一些陳言套語，當然令讀者感到頭痛了。</p>
<p>當然要想澈底了解一語一句的眞正的意義，當然不是容易的事，因爲語言的性質很複雜，人的經騐能力不同，而一事一物的內容，又是無量無限，用某一語某一句作代表的符號，已是不得已的事。以死的方塊字（優秀的作家自然應該使牠變成活的，儘可能接近活的。）去表達複雜的活的事物和情景，當然很難，再要想從文字上感受牠所表達的意急，愈是難上加難了。從有限的文字去感受　所代表事物的無限的內容，確是難事。增進語文感愛的能力請解，註釋，說明，譬喻，查字典，翻辭書，功效都很小。因爲完全感受一語一句的內各簡直少見，即使怎樣善於敎育的敎師也無能爲力，不過他總該儘量訓純敏銳的「語感」，使學生能感受到他所理解的。</p>
<p>一個很普通的名詞，可能含有多重的詩味，形容色彩的語句，可以讓人們體會脫不盡的情調，這全是讀者平時的訓練，不要輕易放鬆一語一句，要體味，揣　、思維，衡量。到了自己動筆時，也須下這種功夫。不過，閱讀時注意調練「語感」，對寫作自然有很大的帮助。托爾斯泰曾說過：「要如寳地表達某一種事物，必須先選擇適當的足以代表那事物意義的語句，在腦中孕育一番，然後再寫出來。」他的話是很値得初學寫作者記取的。</p>
<p>從「新文藝腔調」的病態，我想到訓練「語感」。語文的感受能力增進了，再加上作者的多讀，多觀察，多思想，多充實生活，所寫成的作品，一定比較眞切，而不致「無病呻吟」內容空虛了。</p>

<p>回轉身來，假使你他已悄悄地站在我的後面，我將如何驚喜。我將如何致我的歡迎之辭？</p>
<p>我將熱烈地擁抱你，我要把我們的手揑得發燙，揑得發痛，我還得仔細地辨認，將你從頭看到脚，前後左右都不放鬆，我要看遍你的全身，我需要仔細地辨認；忍受了極大的苦難以後，從顚沛流離中掙扎出來的你，究竟和從前有着幾何不同？</p>
<p>烽火把我們隔離了，烽火把我困住在東南的一角，把你送上了流浪的生涯，你走遍了大半祖國的河山，花發了足足四年的時間，而在這時間之中，你成長了。</p>
<p>是那此時間把我們作弄了，我惱中留着的，你還是十七歲的一個願皮的孩子；而你的影像中，該把你的大哥看成如何的人物呢？</p>

<p>在這一段短暫的時間中，你應該回去看看久久渴念着你的爹娘，還有你的兄弟姊妹，以及其他的許多親人，你應該給他們分享這一杯重逢的甜　。</p>
<p>但是我能够用什麽方法來挽救你夢境的破滅呢？眞實的呈現是可悲的，因爲精心結構的思念和回憶就要撕毁在瞬刻之間了，絇爛的色彩將完全歸於消褪。</p>
<p>你將要看到的是母規的白髮，父親的早衰，兄弟姊妹枯瘦黃萎的臉，被人踐燜了的而且還要被人踐踏下去的破爛的田園，肺結核的農村……家裏的狗會對你汪汪而吠，鄰家的孩子會擠在人隙裏偸偸張望，昔日的遊伴會恭維你發財做官。</p>
<p>而幾個在你臨走之前，曾殷殷叮嚀相送的臉孔，你這次却再也見不到了。他們忍受不住低氣壓的磨折，提早地踏進另十個世界中去了。</p>
<p>而我，更不能不想到遠在西北高原的堂兄，大陸的朔風中，頃頭的草該沒有靑罷！</p>
<p>我願你沒有帶着太高的期望而歸來，唔了一點溫情以後，你將會感到無上的悲哀，因爲你結心給構的思念和同憶，已經撕毁在瞬刻之間了。</p>
<p>長空漠漠，碧天無翳，剛有銀翼在眼前一掠而過，眞的，自從接到你的信，說是「即日待機飛滬」以後，我無時不有這樣的感覺；當我從小窗一角回過身來，突然發覺你已悄悄地站在我的身後。</p>
<p>但是，我能够用什麼方法來挽救你詢爛的夢境之破滅呢？</p>
<p>去罷，這一裏原非你逗留的所在，所幸這裏祇是你的過路，你還要到太平洋的彼岸去。</p>

<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>這封信寄出去以後，墨太太天天盼回信，因爲墨太太渴望翁二太太如今能够給她一點　助。她猜想翁二太太的回信，一定會指示她一條出路。因爲她們是互相同情的至友。况且她過去替翁二太太盡過力，解除過困雖。</p>
<p>果然不久，翁二太太的回信來了。這封信，愈發騷動了墨太太已經不大寗靜的心情；使她安定了十除年的生活，起了個顚覆的變化；甚而願覆了一家人的命運！</p>
<p>這封信上，　二太太果然指示了墨太太一條出路，這條出路解除了墨太太目下徬徨的苦悶。墨太太不暇去考慮這條出路的前途如何，她毅然決定帶着兒女們去邁向這條——也許是坪伏了無限荆棘的出路。這條出路是什麽？是回到北京去！</p>
<p>墨太太宣佈了這個決定以後，跟着便續極地計劃書跋這個決定。麗華和麗雲對於這個決定沒有意見，她們也無從有意見，她們根本還不可能理解，或料想這個決定對於她們，將設于如何的影響？她們是幼稚的。　們祇有唯命是聽。</p>
<p>但是寳鈴不同，他這時初中已經畢業；他已經有思想；有辨識是非的知能。他認爲墨太太這樣作，絕對錯誤，特別是他反對墨太太去找翁二太太，而且有着長久的打算。丙此他爲他的妹妹憂心！他敢斷言：在翁一太太的那個環境裏，　華是不會得到好的敎養！他一貫地深深討厭翁二太太，他覺得墨老爺的死，以及這次墨太太的毁家計劃，部是翁二太太造成的。翁二太太在他的心裏，簡直是一個不可恕的罪人！</p>
<p>「媽，不必到北京去！到北京去並不是好辦法。如果您怕家裏過不下去，那麽，我就出去找事做，我絕不會呌您老人家爲難的。」寳鈴懇切地勸阻墨太太。「再說，爸又剛死不久，咱們不能呌他死不瞑目！」寳鈴這話有着雙層意思，一是他怕墨太太和翁二太太走一條這路，二是他記得墨老爺生前常怨恨北京。</p>
<p>「你不懂，孩子！」墨太太興奮而固執地說。「你的乾爸爸旣然呌咱們去，她一定有辦法。我倒不完全因爲怕在這裏受困，我是覺得住在這裏無親無故，太寂寞。到北京去，說不定你還能再上學。你乾爸爸如今境况還好，她準會帮助咱們的。」</p>
<p>『我不打算再上學了。」寳鈴倔强地回答墨太太。「如果　一定要到北京去，那麽我就留在荆州，我絕不走！」</p>
<p>寳鈴從心裏厭恨翁二太太，所以他下了最大的決心，和墨太太抗議，不去北京。也就是他不願意看見翁二太太，甚而同翁二太太混在一起。</p>
<p>這一下，墨太太可氣煞了！她想着：「就這一個僅有的兒子，還不聽自己的話。簡直是白養了他！追究起來，這都是給墨老爺生前敎壞了。」想到這裏，她好惱！墨老爺使他少年失去夫寵，老年又失去子愛！假如墨老爺這會　還活着的話，她準得再和他拚一架才出氣。</p>
<p>「好，你不走，你一個人留在這裏。不過我可要把田地賣掉，把房子也賣掉，看你怎麽樣活下去？』</p>
<p>「我不是說過嗎？我會出去找事做，我原不需要這些田地與房子。」寳鈴毫不猶豫地說着，連看也不看墨太太一眼。</p>
<p>「拍！」一下沉重的耳光，　在賓鈴的左頰上。</p>
<p>『你，你這不孝的畜牲！你取搪塞我！你，你眼見裏還有沒有媽呀？』</p>
<p>墨太太怒到聲音都發抖了，她想再過去打寳鈴，可是被麗華拖住了她的衣襟。</p>
<p>「好！你現在就給我滾！我絕不再要你這個不孝的畜牲了。』墨太太咆哮地吼着。</p>
<p>寳鈴愕然楞住了！這一掌是他生平第一次的嘗試！他不覺得痛，只覺得熱！他感到悲哀與羞辱！他的感情使他激動得想要還擊那打他的人，可是理智吿訴他：那打他的人，是他的生身之母，他不能打她！於是他悲哀他失去了父愛之後，又將失去母愛！他羞辱這一掌，是由於他所不喜悅的人，而毁了他的一切的罪魁——翁二太太所召來的！他哎緊嘴唇不再辯論什麽，只僵立在一旁，直到聽見墨太太最後發出驅逐的命令，他才毅然拔腿走出去。</p>
<p>「哥哥！」　華追上幾步呌着。</p>
<p>寳鈴沒應，也沒回頭。</p>
<p>「不要喊他，讓他去好了！」墨太太硬着心　說。</p>
<p>可是，最太太背過險的時候，眼裏湧出了　滴英雄淚！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Three Parties' Representatives Arrive at Xuanhua Store to Inspect the Military Situation in Central Hubei, Forming a Special Task Force to Stay and Investigate <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 7th] During yesterday's committee meeting of the Military Mediation Department, there was a fierce debate on the current localized and fragmented disorder and the repeated incidents of sabotage to transportation. American Commissioner Robertson broke his silence and made many criticisms. Therefore, a resolution was made to strengthen the work of the executive teams to maintain the dignity of the Mediation Department. However, all three parties hinted that if the Northeast problem is not resolved, any resolution would be just a piece of paper. All parties hope that the Xuanhua Store problem will be resolved quickly so that negotiations on the Northeast problem can be resumed as soon as possible. The conflicts in Nantong and Gaomi will not be addressed by dispatching separate teams; instead, the Huaiyin team will go to Nantong nearby, and the Jinan team will go to Gaomi to seek a resolution. The American representative of the Chifeng team, Paris, reported to the Military Mediation Department that in mid-April, he attempted to go to the National Army's garrison in Chifeng for liaison but did not notify the Communist side in advance and was detained by the local Communist army for several hours. The American side of the Military Mediation Department has protested to the Communist side about this. Furthermore, the newly appointed Yongnian team departed this morning.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 6th] After the government representative of the Three-Person Committee, Xu Yongchang, the CCP representative, Zhou Enlai, and the Executive Director of the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department, General Bai Rude (representing Marshall), arrived in Hankou, they immediately invited relevant responsible persons for an all-night meeting. It was decided to go to the Communist military region of Xuanhua Store on the 6th for inspection. Furthermore, a special task force was formed by Chen Qian (government representative), Song Shilun (CCP), and Inett (American) to investigate the actual situation in the conflict areas claimed by the CCP.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 6th] Representative Xu Yongchang, Wang Tianming (Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission), CCP representative Zhou Enlai, American representative Bai Rude, and entourage, reporters, and others, a group of more than sixty people, departed from Hankou at 8:30 am on the 6th in ten jeeps to inspect Yihua Store. The three are scheduled to return to Hankou on the 7th. However, the special task force formed by Chen, Song, and Inett intends to stay in the area temporarily and go to Huangpi, Yingshan, Anlu, and other places for investigation. Based on the contact between reporters and the three parties' representatives, the situation seems not as serious as reported.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 7th] CCP representative Zhou Enlai, American representative of the Mediation Department Bai Rude, government representative Xu Yongchang's representative, Deputy Chief of Staff Wang Tianming of the Wuhan Military Affairs Commission, and others, leading an entourage and reporters from Wuhan City, a total of more than forty people, departed from Hankou on the 6th to inspect the CCP's Central Plains Military Region in Xuanhua Store. Due to the destruction of road bridges along the way, they were only able to reach Hekou on the evening of the 6th and arrived in Xuanhua Store on the 7th. It is also learned that the Communist army's Li Xiannian's department recently withdrew nearly 50 million yuan of deposits in Hankou. On May 6th, the Communist staff officer Luo of the Ninth Team escorted it to Xuanhua Store in a car dispatched by the Wuhan Military Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th, Special Dispatch] According to reliable sources, Bai Rude, Xu Yongchang, Zhou Enlai, and others, the Three-Person Task Force Committee that went to Hankou to investigate the actual situation in central Hubei, are scheduled to return to Nanjing before the 9th. It is heard that the National Army in central Hubei has never attempted to encircle and annihilate the Communist army. However, in order to ensure the safety of transportation and protect the lives and property of the people, they are heavily guarded. For the convenience of expanding its army, the Communist army has repeatedly proposed the demand to move its troops to Wuhe. However, the people of Wuhe, upon hearing this news, deeply fear that the arrival of the Communist army would cause chaos and have repeatedly sent representatives to appeal to the government, vowing to oppose it to the death and demanding that the Communist army be driven out of Hubei. The current behavior of the CCP army in Hubei has been deeply hated by the people of Hubei.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chairman's Tea Party Receives Representatives, Explains Reasons for National Assembly Postponement, Hopes for Consistent Joint Completion of Mission <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Chairman Chiang held a tea party at Lixingshe at 4:00 PM on the 7th, receiving representatives to the National Assembly in Nanjing. More than 300 people, including Chen Qiye, and Wu Tiecheng, Wu Dingchang, Chen Lifu, Shao Lizi, Zhang Daofan, Lei Zhen, and Hong Lanyou, attended. When Chairman Chiang arrived, all the representatives stood up and applauded to welcome him. The Chairman smiled and nodded frequently, expressing his condolences to the representatives who had come from afar. Xi Yushu, a representative, spoke first, thanking the Chairman for his kind reception and expressing his support for the central government's consistent policy of returning power to the people and implementing constitutional government. He then stated that the government has repeatedly tolerated negotiations with various parties in order to seek peaceful nation-building, but tolerance should have its limits, and the people cannot bear the pain any longer. It is generally believed that the only way to quickly resolve the current domestic disputes and formulate a constitution is to convene the National Assembly as soon as possible. Then representative Chen Lifu spoke, agreeing with Xi's proposal to convene the National Assembly as soon as possible. He also recounted the situation in Shandong and other places, which have been ravaged by Japanese invaders and Communist troops for many years, causing the people to be in deep distress. His words were extremely sad and indignant. Representative Fang Shaoyun pointed out that the current national crisis and the actions of the Communist Party are affecting the progress of peaceful nation-building. Fang thanked Chairman Chiang for leading the national army and people to strive for national independence and freedom and led all the representatives to stand up and pay their respects. He said that now that the victory of the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the people of the whole country must pledge their loyalty and absolutely support the government and the leader. Therefore, he hopes that the government's tolerance for the various parties will have its limits. He believes that rather than repeatedly negotiating and delaying the time, it is better to convene the National Assembly as soon as possible to deal with the current problems. After the speech, representatives such as He Bingru, Chen Yixiu, Ding Xuanxiao, and Zhu Huiqing spoke one after another, all hoping that the government would quickly relieve the suffering of the people in Shandong and schedule the National Assembly as soon as possible to formulate a constitution. After listening to the opinions of the representatives, Chairman Chiang explained the reasons for the government's postponement of the National Assembly, saying: "All the representatives have traveled far to Nanjing to participate in the National Assembly. This sincerity in fulfilling their responsibilities to the country and seeking happiness for the people has greatly moved me. The government cannot refuse the demands of all of you in terms of reason and law and should implement them immediately. However, as everyone knows, the responsibility of our National Assembly this time is to formulate a constitution, lay the foundation for the country, and seek the stability and unity of the country, so as to reduce the suffering of the people and enable our China to embark on the track of a modern democratic country. Today, the representatives present here must all have embraced this ambitious goal. But precisely for this reason, our government must carefully examine the interests of the country and the safety of the people and make thorough preparations so that the convening of the conference can achieve satisfactory results. If after we convene the conference, we cannot promote the unity of the country or relieve the suffering of the people, but instead deepen the national crisis and increase the suffering of the people, this would violate the purpose of all of you coming to Nanjing for this meeting." The Chairman continued: "I firmly believe that you are representing the true will of the entire people. The government will respect your opinions and make the National Assembly as fast as possible to hold. At the same time, I also hope that you understand the government's predicament in having to postpone it this time and hope that we will work together with the government to complete the mission of our National Assembly to establish a new China based on the Three People's Principles."

<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 7th] The military reorganization of the Military Mediation Executive Department is expected to begin soon. The government and American personnel participating in the military reorganization office have been largely finalized. The CCP also held a separate meeting today to discuss personnel work. According to CCP sources, some personnel newly dispatched from Yan'an attended the meeting today. The Communist army training plan under the military reorganization plan is also in the preparatory stage. The Communist Party has appointed Zhang Zongxun, He Long's chief of staff, to take charge of the military training school planned to be established in Zhangjiakou. Colonel McCluer, the American chief instructor, previously went to Zhangjiakou to discuss training matters with the Communist Party and has now returned south after completing his official duties. In the future, the American side plans to send hundreds of officers and soldiers to serve as trainers. The necessary translators have already left Beiping for Zhangjiakou.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Yuchuan vessel was previously entrusted by the Relief and Relief Administration to be responsible for towing four barges to transport 500 righteous people from Hankou to Nanjing. The Relief and Relief Administration also paid the vessel to handle the food for the righteous people on the 6th. Unexpectedly, the vessel, which departed from Hankou on the 25th, ignored all the righteous people. Not only did it not provide food for the righteous people, but also when the ship arrived in Anqing, it planned to terminate the contract and ordered the righteous people to find their own way to leave. After the condemnation of the local authorities in Anqing, it continued to sail downstream. Yesterday afternoon, in the Sanwenhe River area of ​​Nanjing, it cut the towing rope again, abandoning the four barges. At that time, there was wind and rain, and all the righteous people were in danger of being submerged. Fortunately, the Feiyun vessel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company rescued them from danger.

<p>Suppressing Locust Eggs in North China; Executive Headquarters is Negotiating</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 7th] Amidst the national disasters, the Executive Headquarters is planning to suppress locust eggs in North China, which will increase the severity of the disasters, through negotiation and cooperation. Today, Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Government of the Executive Headquarters, had preliminary discussions with American Commissioner Robertson at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, but has not yet formally discussed with the CCP. According to the information provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there are four areas in North China where locusts breed, namely (1) the New Yellow River area in Henan, which starts from Meng County on the north bank of the Yellow River in the north and extends east to Huaiyang in eastern Henan in a belt-shaped area; (2) the western Shandong area, centered on the Jining area, adjacent to northern Jiangsu and a part of eastern Henan; (3) the southern Hebei area, centered on Qiu County and Pingxiang; (4) the coastal area from Runrun in eastern Hebei to Lijin and the mouth of the Yellow River in Shandong, and extending southwest from Tianjin to Baoding. The above areas are controlled by the Northern Army, so the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry plans to discuss with the CCP to send personnel to the valley area to suppress locust eggs, so as to prevent them from becoming locusts and increasing the severity of this year's disasters.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Shenyang Relief <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Ren, Resident in Shenyang</p>
<p>Shenyang is filled with Beiping sentiments. Shanhaiguan, located between Beiping and Shenyang, separates the two places, causing them to be called "inside the Pass" and "outside the Pass." However, based on my experience of living in both places, the differences are few, and the similarities are many. The differences lie in the accent and dialects, while the similarities are in the architecture and some living habits.</p>
<p>Of course, I cannot deny that Beiping is ultimately Beiping, and Shenyang is ultimately Shenyang. Historically, Beiping has a long history as a capital city, including the Qing Dynasty. In terms of names, it has only been called Yanjing, Beijing, Beiping, and so on. Panyang, however, only became prominent after the Aisin Gioro clan moved south from Jilin, establishing Jianyang Middle Street. After entering the Pass, it was first called Shengjing, then Fengtian. In December of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Blue Sky White Sun flag was raised in the Northeast. In January of the following year, Fengtian Province was renamed Liaoning Province, and Fengtian, where the provincial capital was located, was officially named Shenyang. After September 18th, the Japanese changed Shenyang back to Fengtian City, and Liaoning back to Fengtian. Since August 15th, Shenyang is naturally still Shenyang, although the three northeastern provinces have been reorganized into nine provinces. In short, Panyang is merely a city that rose to prominence with the rise of the Qing Dynasty. In terms of the actual situation, Panyang does not have the Three Seas that make people linger, nor the charming Kunming Lake and intoxicating Longevity Hill. However, in Panyang, after visiting Beiping, Changchun, and Harbin, one always feels that even though one is in Shenyang in the Northeast, the local atmosphere makes one feel as if one is in the antique Beiping.</p>
<p>On the streets of Shenyang, it is indeed difficult to encounter tourists who are as graceful, leisurely, and unhurried as those in Beiping. Northern rouge, praised for its simplicity and elegance, is also rarely seen. At the same time, it is not like Changchun, where some streets are almost completely modernized, with tall buildings and three-dimensional architecture, creating a fresh and new impression. Nor is it like Harbin, where the Nangang area is rich in European scenery, and Daoli China Street is full of Shanghai flavor. However, walking on the streets always makes one think that Shenyang is filled with Beiping sentiments.</p>
<p>When taking a bath at the Huiting Bathhouse in the city, one instinctively compares it to Qinghua Garden in Beiping. When often visiting the Zhongyuan Company in the Beishi Market, one cannot help but think of the Dong'an Market and Xidan Market in Beiping. Changchun does not have a bathhouse like Qinghua Garden in Beiping. I think this may be because Changchun was previously the political center of the Northeast, and people living in large buildings in Changchun did not need to leave the building to bathe. Therefore, bathhouses like the Nanguan Dongxing Bathhouse only maintain their existence in a state of decline. Harbin has also not seen any luxurious bathhouses. If there are any, the facilities are also ordinary. Instead, Panyang and Beiping complement each other. One has Huiting, and the other has Qinghua Garden. The coincidental similarity in the complete facilities of the bathhouses in the two places can precisely illustrate that the living conditions and habits of the people in the two places are not far apart. In particular, one thing I feel is similar to Beiping is the old foot masseur in Huiting. At the age of fifty-two, he has been working in Huiting for thirty-six years. He has spent his youth and middle age in the warm room, filing feet. His old age will continue to be spent in the warm room, filing ten toes for people. His "enlightened" acceptance of fate and contented joy are exactly the same as the expressions of the waiters in the restaurants in Beiping bathhouses, all belonging to the same type.</p>
<p>In the city, one can see the magnificent imperial palace built during the Qing Dynasty. In front of the imperial palace, there are memorial arches similar to those in Beiping. The pine shade of Dongling and the cypress forest of Beiling are verdant and lush, no different from the Imperial Ancestral Temple in Beiping. When climbing among them, who does not feel as if they are in Beiping? Speaking of cypress forests and pine shade, even though the Northeast is a region that produces abundant forests, people boast: "The forests are lush, blocking out the sun and moon, hanging vines and trailing creepers, so that wind and smoke cannot penetrate." However, within the scope of the urban area, there are not many places like Shenyang with pine shade and cypress forests. Here, I want to add a disappointing remark, that is, the pine shade of Dongling has recently been severely cut down. Major General Guo Qi, the representative of the 29th Group Government, once returned to Shenyang from Fushun and, seeing the situation of the pine trees being cut down, said to me: "Those who cut down the trees are cutting them down fiercely, one after another, all returning fully loaded. Although the pine forest is very large, it cannot withstand such ruthless logging. Seeing it is truly heartbreaking!" After he finished speaking to me, he anxiously expressed: "You in the press should often speak out to curb this!" I was moved, and I told the relevant authorities about the situation of the pine forest being ravaged, asking them to quickly find a way to prevent it. Here, I am also willing to mention its cause. In my opinion, this kind of thing will probably continue to happen in the future. The government authorities should really pay attention and should make the tree cutters understand that this is a shameful violation of the law, not a way to gain glory and take advantage.

<p>[Central News Agency, this city] The date of arrival in China of General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, will be one day earlier than expected. General Eisenhower is scheduled to fly directly from Manila to Nanjing tomorrow (the 9th), without stopping in Shanghai. It is generally expected that General Eisenhower will arrive in Nanjing tomorrow afternoon. The purpose of General Eisenhower's trip is to inspect the situation of American troops in various regions, and he will also give instructions on the progress of the American troop repatriation work. The highest authority of the American military here, in order to receive General Eisenhower's instructions and submit work reports, has scheduled a special plane to Nanjing at 2:30 this afternoon to greet him.

It is said that in the next few years, if any war occurs, it will be necessary to use existing or in-production weapons in the initial stages. Eisenhower's plan first emphasizes the Air Force, "detailed, free, and unbiased" scientific research, and a globally distributed intelligence network. Eisenhower also issued a warning that any country that now possesses scientific resources can inflict heavy damage on the world's most powerful countries, turning them into ruins. Although Eisenhower advocates that military leaders should have creative imagination, he still attaches great importance to the infantry.</p>
<h3 id="e16">A Record of Escaping from Changchun - Liu Zuozhou Narrates the Communist Army's Capture <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency reporter Liu Zhuozhou, Panyang, 7th] After experiencing twenty-seven days of thrilling, desperate, and concealed life, the reporter has finally escaped from Changchun, which was secretly occupied by the Communist army, and safely arrived in Panyang at 5:00 p.m. on the 5th. In this free world, recalling the past difficult situation is like a nightmare. The reporter, accompanied by his wife in disguise, said goodbye to Changchun at 5:00 a.m. on the 2nd under the Communist army's strict search. The journey was non-stop day and night, covering 365 kilometers. They were interrogated by the Communist army seven times along the way, and there were three major checkpoints that were bypassed, undetected by the Communist army. The reporter must solemnly declare that I was never captured by the Communist army. The previous report that I and five American reporters, as well as Shao Shenzhi of the Central Daily News and Zhao Shixun of the News Daily, were living together under the surveillance of the Communist army is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Communist Army Shells Changchun</p>
<p>Before the Communist army officially attacked Changchun on the 14th, I and Shao and Zhao lived in the Mantan Building. The next day, as the battle situation became tense, Shao and Zhao moved to the Foreign Affairs Commissioner's Office where the five American reporters were staying, together with Mayor Zhao. I moved to the Central Bank Building where the defense headquarters was located, preparing to accept the Communist army's final attack. Later, the executive headquarters and other units of civilian personnel also moved to the bank one after another. The real battle lasted for five days and four nights. The Communist army possessed tanks and heavy artillery that had never been seen before. Their strength and firepower were far superior to the defending army. The main buildings occupied by the defending army, such as the Continental Academy of Sciences, the State Council, the Municipal Government, and the Dongtuo Building, were all set on fire after being hit. In addition, the Fushunhou and Tianxingfu flour mills, and the Yuyiyuan rice mill were also shelled and burned. These three factories were large-scale production institutions with decades of history in Changchun. The Central Bank Building was hit by the most shells and caught fire three times. Because the building was particularly solid, the fires extinguished themselves, but all the doors and windows were broken.</p>
<p>Entering the Backyard by Climbing Over the Wall</p>
<p>At noon on the 18th, the Communist army climbed over the wall from the northwest and entered the backyard of the bank. Although Deputy Commander Liu Debo personally supervised the battle to eliminate them, the downward trend was irreversible, so it was decided to break through after dark. However, before sunset, the Communist army, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked outside the building. The front and back doors were blocked by fierce fire nets. At this critical moment, Chen Jiazhen, Liu Debo, and their staff and guards first jumped out of the east side door of the bank. Several people were shot down. Later, when the others saw this, they did not dare to go out. At that time, the reporter was stuck in the crowd for about three minutes. Later, I heard someone shouting, "Turn around and go to the back door." The reporter squeezed out of the crowd and rushed to the back door. Seeing that the fire was raging outside the door, there was no way to break through. At that time, some soldiers were still shooting out of the windows, and some bullets flew in from the windows. Soon, someone shouted, "Brothers, don't fight anymore," "Chinese people don't fight Chinese people." The reporter knew what the consequences of these words would be.</p>
<p>The Last Stronghold is Occupied</p>
<p>So I quickly turned around and jumped into the electrical room on the second floor below ground. A few minutes later, the Central Bank Building, the last stronghold of the defending army, was occupied by the Communist army. The reporter hid in the electrical room for forty hours and finally escaped from the tiger's mouth at 10:00 a.m. on the 20th, disguised as an electrical worker. After that, I changed into merchant's clothing and hid in a civilian's home. On the way to Shenyang, the reporter met a large number of merchants traveling between Changchun and Panyang, transporting goods. Those coming south mostly transported soybean oil and alcohol, while those going north transported cotton and food. Entering and leaving the Communist army's checkpoints, they were strictly inspected and charged a 20% transit tax. On the morning of the day I left Changchun, at 11:00 a.m., I encountered four Korean Communist soldiers who were blocking the road to seize vehicles. The merchants traveling with me drove away in a panic. The car the reporter was riding in was chased by a Korean soldier with a gun, but fortunately escaped his range at high speed.</p>
<p>What I Saw During the Escape</p>
<p>During the three-day journey after that, I saw many Korean farmers working in the rice fields on both sides of the road. According to the villagers in the same car, the behavior of these Korean people in the puppet Manchukuo era was no different from that of the Japanese, or even worse. The land they cultivated was mostly forcibly purchased or occupied. After Japan surrendered, they feared retaliation from the villagers and fled one after another. Now that there are compatriots of theirs in the Communist army, they have returned in advance. Also, when Changchun fell, the Communist army searched in every possible way for the whereabouts of two people: one was Wei Xijiu, the manager of the Central Bank, and the other was the reporter. Wei and the reporter originally lived in the same room, but separated in the chaos during the breakthrough on the 18th. Wei and his chief accountant, Mr. Xu, were once captured, but soon escaped and are now also in Panyang. The Communist army's search for the party may be to force him to open the warehouse.

<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 7th] Associated Press reporter Packard, International News Service reporter Ebner, and New York Times reporter Lippmann arrived in Beiping this afternoon on a C47 aircraft of the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department from Changchun. Three Chinese accompanying reporters also arrived on the same plane. The other two American reporters, Wheeler of the Chicago Daily News and Madison of the Associated Press, stopped in Panyang on the way from Changchun to Beiping. The reporters were unharmed in the battle of Changchun, despite being exposed to danger during their stay in Changchun, and their health is good. Because the Communist army suspected their actions, the reporters were detained in their residence for more than two weeks. Our reporter Packard intends to describe his experience of staying in Changchun in a telegram. When he declared, "Thank God! We have regained our freedom," he was expressing the feelings of everyone in the group.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th] Director Bei of the Finance Department recently stated at the Memorial Week session: Legitimate sources of revenue will be opened separately, and the following will be carried out: (1) Request the Central Government to change the allocation of land tax to counties and cities to physical objects; (2) Ask the Ministry of Finance to immediately levy deed tax; (3) Comply with the instructions of the Executive Yuan and hold locally appropriate taxes and fees. If these three methods can be implemented, the finances of counties and cities can often become self-reliant.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 6th] Deputy Chairman Zhang Zhizhong delivered a long speech at the expanded Memorial Week and the May Fifth Revolution Memorial Meeting this morning. He stated: Xinjiang is a province of China, and everything must be unified under the provincial government. Separation will never be allowed. People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang must unite sincerely. I [Zhang said of himself] guarantee that the future Xinjiang Provincial Government will be a 100% democratic government. Xinjiang will implement local autonomy, which is to implement national autonomy. However, autonomy and unity are not contradictory but mutually needed. Implementing autonomy does not mean splitting the country, but rather promoting the country's unity and solidarity. His topic was "The Spiritual Foundation for Building a New Xinjiang with the Three Principles of the People." He first elaborated on the four things of peaceful unification, democratic unity, and finally said: There are three things that I must eliminate: namely corruption, gambling, and opium. Corruption is my greatest enemy, and I will have several ways to deal with it.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou, 7th] The traitor Miao Bin was sentenced to death and refused to accept it, applying for a retrial. More than 20 days have passed. Recently, the newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai have been spreading the news that the Supreme Court has ruled to uphold the original judgment. Although President Sun of the Jiangsu High Court denied this, stating that he had not received a formal order, Miao Bin has already read the news in the newspapers in prison. According to internal reliable information, his attitude has recently become abnormal, and his nerves are in a state of madness. He spends all day shouting and scolding in the cell. Although it only shows Miao Bin's fear of death, it is enough to see the fault of inaccurate news. The Jin Guard Office, in order to prevent accidents, has specially installed heavy-duty electric lights in the cell, which remain on all night, and has added guards to monitor him day and night. President Sun of the High Court has gone to Beijing yesterday, and it is expected that he will be able to obtain accurate information on the day of his return to Suzhou.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 7th] Chief Executive Chen Yi met with reporters and said: In the future, Taiwan's politics, in order to cooperate with economic construction, will strengthen design and assessment work. The administrative three-link system, advocated by Chairman Chiang, is of great importance to improving administrative efficiency. Unfortunately, most agencies have not thoroughly implemented it in the past, so the effectiveness is still limited. In the future, it will be strictly followed in order to improve efficiency. Regarding economic construction, the principle of implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood will be used to formulate a five-year economic construction plan. In the future, Taiwan plans to establish more cooperative farms, train young people, and enrich talent. It is necessary to enable young farmers to run cooperative farms on their own. Regarding public enterprises, Chen believes that the system of joint public-private management is not easy to be effective because the goals of the government and businesses are different. In the future, most of the public enterprises in this province will be classified as government-run if they are large in scale, and the rest will be completely commercially operated. The Bank of Taiwan is scheduled to be officially taken over on the 20th of this month. In addition to the Bank of Taiwan, a Land Bank will also be formed. Finally, Chen expressed his deep welcome to various experts and reporters from the mainland to come to Taiwan to assist in the construction of a new Taiwan.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Shenyang Sketches <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Sent by Fang Ren from Shenyang</p>
<p>(Continued from the first page)</p>
<p>Speaking of a place as large as Shenyang, some minor things give one a sense of both laughter and tears. For example, when we went to visit Chairman Xu Zhen, the carriage driver couldn't figure out where the provincial government's gate was. Fortunately, there was a police station by the roadside, so we had to ask a police officer for directions. The officer told us, "Go through that gate, and the tall building in front is it." We rushed into that gate, only to find a vast open space inside, with no door leading to the building in front. We had to turn back and ask again, and he said, "You can just climb over that short wall." We couldn't help but feel speechless. Climbing over walls to visit someone? There's no such thing! Especially coming from a police officer who was supposed to guide us, such a brilliant suggestion!</p>
<p>And for another example: The roads are uneven, overgrown with weeds, enough to shatter one's behind. There's trash everywhere. One really wonders when Shenyang will be cleaned up and made neat and tidy, and when the roads will be repaired and made smooth. Putting that aside, when will the reckless tricycle drivers learn to proceed in an orderly manner, understand that if everyone rushes and the road is limited, getting stuck together not only makes it impossible to get there quickly, but also creates a risk of accidents?</p>
<p>Shenyang, perhaps the entire Northeast, was oppressed by Japanese imperialism for fourteen years without a chance to breathe. This kind of yoke is poisonous, it goes against human nature. But in the eight months since August 15th, although the yoke has been removed, in this freedom, in the face of unemployment and lack of resources, some people are truly lost and don't know what to do. What's right? What benefits me is right. Achieving my goal is everything. But will the result be as I desire? Will it really benefit me? To understand this clearly is truly a tragedy!</p>
<p>The curfew time in Shenyang has been shortened. Starting from the 26th, the curfew starts at 8:30 PM every night and ends at 4:30 AM the next morning. This order extended the business hours of the city's dance halls—dance halls filled with Japanese beauties creating a spring atmosphere—by two hours. Originally they closed at 5:00 PM, now they close at 7:00 PM. Yet, the city's power supply has not been fully restored. Most of the city districts fall asleep under the dark wings of the night god as the sun sets. Even as I write this, I rely solely on a single lonely lamp. Looking out the glass window at the night sky, I see a tall Western-style building towering in the distance, its lights gleaming. The longer I look, it no longer seems like a Western-style building, but a large ship floating in the vast, boundless sea, twinkling and bobbing in the night sky.</p>
<p>Shenyang's public security is becoming more stable by the day. However, when it comes to the takeover work, some areas are truly unsatisfactory. Are we going to repeat the mistakes we made in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin in the Northeast as well? The Northeast is a sick body; it's not yet recovered to full health. We must deal with it carefully. Otherwise, cruel history will teach us another lesson. I, who returned from Changchun with wounds in my heart, truly cannot bear to see Shenyang, the Northeast, repeat the mistakes of the past! (April 27th, 3:00 AM)</p>

<h3 id="e29">Europe One Year After the Armistice <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>It has been a full year since the Nazis surrendered and Europe achieved armistice. In this year, the people of Europe, especially the people of Germany, have been able to breathe a sigh of relief in their fire-ravaged cities, no longer smelling the scent of gunpowder. Peace has been restored, but the whole of Europe is scarred. Economically, no country is not experiencing a serious crisis; politically, no country, except for the victorious Britain and the Soviet Union, does not feel restless; socially, no country does not feel unbalanced. However, after such a brutal war, recovery and reconstruction cannot be achieved in a short period of time. This year has at least allowed the people of Europe to begin to embark on the road to recovery, although this road is long. Although the European armistice has been in effect for a year, the peace treaty, which serves as the cornerstone of European peace after the war, has yet to be agreed upon. The peace of the past year has been a peace under armistice, and the establishment of lasting peace in Europe still depends on future efforts. Hitler and Nazism have been crushed. The shape of post-war Europe can also be seen roughly. What kind of Europe will post-war Europe be?</p>
<p>Moscow has undoubtedly become an important stronghold in Europe. The fate of Europe and even the entire world is decided not in London, not in Paris, but in Moscow in Eastern Europe. Berlin is destroyed. Rome only has the brilliance emitted by the Pope, which can illuminate people's hearts everywhere. Today, one year after the European armistice, the entire Eastern Europe, from Finland through Poland, Czechoslovakia, to Yugoslavia, is now under the control of the Soviet Union. This is an established fact. However, the Soviet Union has not stopped its attempts to expand its influence. They want to cede the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, transfer Trieste to Yugoslavia, and entrust the Soviet Union with the administration of Italian North Africa and East Africa. The Soviet Union's firm and consistent policy is to expand, expand to the Adriatic Sea, to the Mediterranean Sea, to the Indian Ocean. We will not mention expansion in the Far East for now. The entire Eastern Europe has now become a vassal of the Soviet Union; but the Soviet Union still wants to expand everywhere to ensure its "security". The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, convened to draft a peace treaty, broke up unhappily in London. Now, it has been held in Paris for over a week, but no agreement has been reached. Other than the fact that Hitler and Nazism have been crushed, what is the difference between this post-war Europe and pre-war Europe?</p>
<p>In Europe, which is almost being swept away by communism, only Britain and France are still holding high the torch and are strong bulwarks to defend European civilization. Although today's France has formed a government centered on left-wing parties, French leftists, except for the Communist Party, all belong to moderate reformism, like the British Labour Party. Although they promote socialism, they do not sympathize with communism. Moreover, beyond the left-wing parties, there is also the People's Republican Party, which represents the Catholic forces and has one-third of the voters. The fact that the draft constitution of the Fourth Republic was rejected by the people in the referendum is enough to show that the French people have a stable trend and do not necessarily agree with left-wing policies. All these signs have a stabilizing effect in turbulent Europe. In a truly democratic country, in a country with developed civil rights, the public opinion of the people cannot be faked. They do not need communism; only in countries with underdeveloped civil rights, such as Bulgaria, can public opinion be fabricated. The establishment of the British Labour government after the war and the loss of power by left-wing parties in France are a stabilizing factor in European politics.</p>
<p>The people of post-war Germany must, of course, pay the price for starting the war. There is no Germany anymore. Germany is divided into four occupation zones: Soviet, American, British, and French. The Soviet occupation zone includes most of pre-war Germany and is the heart of Germany. There, the Soviet Union is fostering the regeneration of the German people. US Secretary of State Byrnes' proposal for a Four-Power Treaty was also opposed by the Soviet Union. The ancestors of communism were originally Germans, Marx and Engels; how the German situation will evolve in the future is related to the future of the entire world. Will it pursue its traditional eastward expansion policy in another guise, or will it tend towards the embrace of Western European civilization? It is certainly too early to say at present. The United Nations has a plan to occupy Germany for 25 or even 50 years, but today's facilities can affect future developments. The future of Germany is still a mystery.</p>
<p>Famine is engulfing the entire Europe, which is an inevitable phenomenon after the war. Under the famine, the people of Europe cannot care about political colors, so relief also takes on a political meaning. Only by freeing Europe from famine can the people begin to have a self-awareness. In Europe one year after the armistice, people are still struggling in hardship. They are hoping to get clothes and food. They are looking forward to peace after the war.</p>

<p>Police Chief Arrested for Accepting Bribes and Releasing a Traitor</p>
<p>Gu Wennong, the consultant of Zhangpu Police Sub-station in this county, personally led police officers to Dazhi Village last month and arrested Zhang Wencai, the commander of the puppet security force. However, he accepted bribes and released Zhang the same night. The county government has now discovered this matter, and the police chief has been arrested and sent to the city for interrogation.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Grain Loans Suspended, Rice Prices Fall</p>
<p>Rice prices in the city have been rising sharply due to purchases from other areas. After the county government took effective measures, they have dropped slightly. Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, concerned about the people's food supply, went to Beijing on the 4th to visit Premier Song of the Executive Yuan and Minister Xu of the Ministry of Food, to personally explain the soaring rice prices in the province and inquire about the reasons for issuing grain loans. Premier Song and Minister Xu unanimously stated that the initial intention of issuing grain loans was to encourage grain merchants to purchase large quantities from the producing areas in order to suppress rice prices. Unexpectedly, the rice merchants did not purchase from the producing areas but continued to speculate and manipulate in the city, which led to adverse consequences. Therefore, it has now been decided to suspend the issuance of grain loans. In the future, rice prices in Wuxi will definitely gradually decline.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Traitor Arrested and Sent to the High Court</p>
<p>Gu Qifa, a native of Punan in this county, served as a secret agent for the enemy's secret service during the occupation, extorting the villagers in Yexie, Tinglin, and other places, committing all kinds of evil deeds. Recently, he was reported by the people of Yexie, and the district office arrested him and sent him to the county government for investigation. After questioning and recording his confession, the county government believed that the case involved collusion with the enemy and sent the police to escort him to the Jiangsu High Court for trial.</p>

<p>Chen Songping Inspects Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Zhejiang Supervisory Commissioner's Office has been sending personnel to investigate the situation in various places every month. Last month, in accordance with the regulations on circuit supervision, Supervisory Commissioner Jiang Bocheng specially dispatched the director of the office to represent him and inspect various counties in Jiashan. In order to understand the actual situation and administrative situation in Eastern Zhejiang after the recovery, it is reported that the director of the office, Chen Songping, will continue to represent him and lead a number of staff members to inspect Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Shangyu, Yuyao, Ciqi, Zhengxian, Fenghua, and other counties, starting on the 6th.</p>
<p>Hangzhou's Silk Industry Experiences a Depression. Hangzhou's silk industry was originally the only lifeline for the people of Hangzhou. Recently, the rice market situation has been increasingly sluggish. It once got excited after the gold prices soared, but the good times did not last long and prices dropped immediately. As a result, people are idle and the trade is sparse. People in the industry are already feeling a great threat. At the same time, exports are blocked due to the disruption of traffic in the North, and the Shanghai market is full of inventory. The purchasing power of this city is also very weak, and speculators who hoard nationally are not interested due to the gloomy future. Therefore, the silk industry has recently become depressed. According to the survey, the silk industry is the top industry in Hangzhou. The so-called silk life in half of the city has now reached its most serious juncture.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Order Strictly Prohibiting Interception of Commercial Salt. The Liangzhe Salt Affairs Administration, in order to thoroughly implement the free transportation and sale of salt, approved merchants to go directly to the Yuyao and Qianqing field areas or the Yiqiao transfer station to purchase and transport salt. However, recently in Shao, Tong, Lan, Qu, Jiang and other places, there have been scattered soldiers and bandits who have set prices to intercept commercial salt, attempting to manipulate it and create a black market phenomenon. It is reported that the administration believes that this illegal situation not only hinders the current policy of civilian transportation and sale of salt, but also has a great impact on the people's food supply. Therefore, it has telegraphed the Quzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office and the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command to issue a strict prohibition.</p>
<p>Linhai</p>
<p>Adjustment Committee Holds Price-Stabilization Sales</p>
<p>Chief Kong of the Haimen District Office in this county, considering the severe food shortages in various places and the panic among civilians, specially discussed with various agencies to organize a Haimen People's Food Adjustment Committee. They raised 15 million yuan from shares and 10 million yuan from rice merchants, for a total of 25 million yuan, to purchase rice and hold price-stabilization sales to help the civilians. The sales period is scheduled to start on the 9th of this month and continue until the new grain is harvested.</p>
<p>Wuxian</p>
<p>Police Chief Responds to Accusations</p>
<p>Yang Huaichun, the police chief of this county, took office in February of this year. Recently, he suddenly discovered anonymous leaflets attacking him, pointing out many issues. Police Chief Yang then made statements on each issue as follows: "1. The issue of phantom positions for police officers: It was Deng Shanfeng, a staff member of the bureau, and Chen Tiansheng, a clerk, who first opened a list of vacant positions on a slip, falsely used the phrase 'approved', and handed it over to various offices to be included in the roster, and then used this roster to accuse the superiors, intending to frame them. 2. Salary and interest: In March, the police officers only received a part of their salary at first, which was then transferred to pay for food expenses. Later, the local authorities borrowed rice to distribute, deducting 2,500 yuan from the salary for each dou of rice according to regulations, and the balance was issued as it was received. The dates and amounts are all recorded and can be checked. 3. Obstructing sanitation: At that time, it is true that cleaning worker Qi Xuewen injured a boatman due to obstructing the transportation of garbage, but he has been handed over to the court for trial, and there is a record to check. 4. Salary of cleaning workers: Regarding the unpaid salaries of cleaning workers during the tenure of the previous chief, because of the order of the county magistrate, it was inconvenient to pay them on their behalf. Starting from February, the salaries were issued as soon as they were received. However, according to the establishment, there are only 30 cleaning workers in this county, but there are actually more than 160. In order to tell the whole truth, the salaries received were divided equally."</p>

<p>Agricultural Loans Implemented as Silkworm Rearing Season Arrives</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Silkworm Industry Improvement Committee, considering that the silkworm rearing season is approaching and silkworm farmers need a lot of money to buy silkworm eggs and mulberry leaves, specially discussed with the Agricultural Bank of China to implement agricultural loans. It is stipulated that each silkworm farmer can borrow 1,000 yuan for rearing one sheet of silkworm eggs. Orders have now been issued to all silkworm industry improvement zones to comply with this regulation.</p>

<p>Communist Troops from Jingjiang and Taixing Destroy Highways</p>
<p>Communist troops in Jingjiang have been active in the periphery of the National Army in recent days, destroying bridges on the Dongzhang-Huangqiao highway between Jingjiang and Taixing, and laying landmines at various key points. For example, after the Communist troops occupied Jing Shizhuang, they forcibly conscripted laborers and levied heavy taxes. They wantonly tortured and killed those with some assets. In the Battle of Xiaohai Town in Nantong, the 313th Regiment of the 105th Division of the National Army was stationed there and complied with the ceasefire order. Since they were fiercely attacked by the Communist troops, Regiment Commander Guan Xiuwu was forced to fight back, resulting in hand-to-hand combat. There were only two battalions of garrison troops, and the numbers were vastly different. The Communist troops were powerful, and they used 5,000 to 6,000 civilians as vanguards. Regiment Commander Guan was killed in action, and Deputy Regiment Commander Xu Renkui led the team in a sudden attack, only to be surrounded. As reinforcements did not arrive, they also died one after another. Wang Tiehan, commander of the 49th Army stationed in Cheng, has been inspecting the north and south banks of the Yangtze River these days, which is quite hard work. On the 3rd, the 237th Regiment of Jingcheng arrested 11 male and female spies with hand grenades and rifles near Dongxingang and sent them to the Jiangyin Military Headquarters for handling.</p>

<p>Communist Troops Destroyed Songchuan Power Lines</p>
<p>The electric light poles and lines from Xinpu to Lianyungang of the Haizhou Power Plant are often destroyed by the Communist troops and are always repaired in a timely manner. On the night of the 25th of last month, during heavy rain, the Communist troops carried out large-scale destruction of the power lines. In the Songchuan section, 3,360 meters of high-voltage transmission lines and 220 meters of telephone lines were destroyed. It is reported that this high-voltage power line is extremely valuable, and the plant does not have this in stock, making it difficult to restore the power supply to Lianyungang City in a short period of time. The cut power lines were all taken away. According to the current price estimates, the loss amounts to more than 20 million legal tender.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Foreign Ministers' Conference Shifts Focus: Discusses Balkan Issues; Has Agreed to Return Outer Transylvania to Romania; Rumors of Talks Between Truman and Stalin <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 7th Broadcast: The Four Power Foreign Ministers held a meeting this morning to discuss the Romanian treaty, which was agreed to return the province of Outer Transylvania to Romania. This province had previously been "gifted" to Hungary by Hitler.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 7th Broadcast: The stalemate in the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference regarding the Italian issue has not been broken. It is rumored that the Foreign Ministers' Conference will temporarily adjourn and reconvene in two months.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 7th Broadcast: The Italian Prime Minister visited the British Foreign Secretary in Paris yesterday and agreed to hand over the colonies to the United Nations for disposal.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 6th Dispatch] The Four Power Foreign Ministers will abandon the Italian treaty issue and discuss Balkan issues at the plenary meeting tomorrow. The agenda drafted by the deputies of the Four Power Foreign Ministers will first discuss the Romanian treaty, including the future status of Outer Transylvania, the demarcation of other borders, and the management of navigation on the Danube River. The Finnish treaty will obviously be left for later discussion. Other more important discussion items are as follows: (1) Bulgaria's borders and reparations issues; (2) Revision or abolition of the affiliation of Outer Transylvania to Hungary, the border between Hungary and Romania, the northern border, and possible reparations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 7th Dispatch] The Four Power Foreign Ministers have decided to abandon the explosive Italian issue and will not discuss it, at least temporarily; it is tantamount to acknowledging that they cannot break the stalemate on the Italian southern border issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th Dispatch] Amidst the stalemate in the Foreign Ministers' Conference, rumors have emerged that Truman will meet with Stalin. New York Times diplomatic correspondent Dunston said: President Truman intends to seek other ways to meet with Stalin in person. When the reporter inquired about this statement with White House Press Secretary Ross, Ross did not want to comment. Washington relations believe that this suggestion was conveyed to Moscow by US Ambassador Smith. This time, the rumors about the Truman-Stalin talks did not mention British Prime Minister Attlee, which shows that the United States intends to negotiate with the Soviet Union separately. Byrnes had previously proposed concluding a four-power treaty to prevent Germany from committing aggression again, but it was opposed by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the United States' intention to negotiate with the Soviet Union alone has become even stronger.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Soviet Troops Have Completely Withdrawn from the Territory; Iran Notifies the Security Council; However, According to British Sources, Soviet Troops in Azerbaijan Province Have Not Completed Their Withdrawal; Foreigners Can Now Freely Travel to Northern Iran <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] London, 7th: The Iranian Foreign Minister has notified the Security Council, stating: Soviet troops have completely withdrawn from Iranian territory. However, according to a dispatch from the British Broadcasting Corporation's correspondent in the Iranian capital, Soviet troops in Azerbaijan Province have not yet completed their withdrawal.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 7th] The United Nations Security Council had previously decided that the governments of Iran and the Soviet Union should submit reports on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iranian territory by the 6th of this month. By midnight on the 6th, neither Iran nor the Soviet Union had submitted a complete report. According to a notification from Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Ardale, to UN Secretary-General Lie, the Iranian government is unable to submit a report on the matter while Soviet troops are withdrawing from various Iranian provinces. The Iranian Ambassador's statement is based on an investigation report made by responsible officials in the country. The notification continued: The Iranian government has learned through indirect channels that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Azerbaijan Province will be completed by the 7th of this month, but this news cannot be confirmed by Iranian official inspectors because the Iranian government has been unable to exercise its administrative powers in Azerbaijan Province since November 7, 1945. This has already been reported to the Security Council, and since then, the Iranian government has had no opportunity to verify the actual situation in the province. The Iranian government hopes to take all possible steps to end the Iranian issue, but it is still difficult to predict how the situation will develop. As soon as the Iranian government determines the actual situation in Azerbaijan Province, it will submit a report to the Security Council. According to sources close to the Security Council, the Iranian Ambassador's notification proves that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran is a fact, which may be sufficient for the Security Council to remove the Iranian issue from its permanent agenda. If the Soviet Union can submit a similar note, it will greatly ease the task of the Soviet delegation. Moreover, such a note would not only not damage the dignity of the Soviet Union but would also increase the effectiveness of the Security Council's future decisions. Soviet Representative Gromyko previously stated that he would no longer participate in any debate on the Iranian issue, but it is generally hoped that he will submit a report before the Security Council meeting on the 8th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 6th] A high-ranking diplomat here told reporters tonight that, according to unofficial reports, the Red Army is rapidly withdrawing from Azerbaijan Province and appears to be able to complete the withdrawal tonight. British officials arrived here by plane from Tabriz last night, and they stated that the Red Army held a farewell review there yesterday, and then left the city with 180 trucks and 20 tanks leading the way.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 7th] The British delegation here received official news from Tehran and Tabriz that Soviet troops are currently withdrawing from Iran on a large scale and at a rapid pace. All delegations to the Security Council here believe that Soviet troops will be able to complete their withdrawal from Iran by midnight today, the deadline set by the Security Council. News from Azerbaijan received by the British Embassy in Tehran also stated that the Red Army is currently withdrawing, but it is impossible to verify whether it has completely withdrawn. Although the Iranian government has not yet received formal notification of the Soviet troop withdrawal, Soviet aircraft in Tabriz have allowed British people to travel to the area without requesting a pass from the Soviet Embassy. This is the first time in more than four years that foreigners can freely travel to northern Iran.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Subcommittee Investigating the Franco Regime Holds Secret Meeting to Study New Evidence <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The subcommittee of the United Nations Security Council held its second secret meeting to investigate the threat to world peace posed by the Franco government. After the meeting, it announced that the committee had studied new evidence and requested the United Nations War Crimes Commission to provide a list of war criminals currently in Spain. Madrid dispatch: The Spanish Foreign Ministry has firmly denied Poland's accusation that Spain is sheltering Nazi members and holding Nazi assets. However, according to UN Secretary-General Lie, the subcommittee has not yet received any statement from the Spanish government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 6th] Regarding the issue of the Spanish Franco government, UN Secretary-General Lie recently told reporters that he has received notes from the governments of several countries but declined to specify which countries or the number of notes. He only said that these countries are acting in accordance with the rules adopted in the note from the subcommittee on the Spanish issue to the 51 United Nations. The notes submitted by the countries are all considered confidential documents and are submitted directly to the subcommittee for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e34">After the New Draft Constitution is Rejected, the French Cabinet Discusses the Political Situation; Britain Believes the Outcome of the Vote is a Rejection of the Communist Party <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] London, 7th: The French cabinet held an emergency meeting today to discuss the problems caused by the French people's rejection of the new constitution and decided that the French parliament will convene a general assembly on June 6 to discuss drafting a new constitution.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 6th] Leaders of the left-wing parties met tonight to discuss strategies for the June 2 elections, in light of the failure of the constitution draft they supported in the referendum, defeated by the conservatives. The Communist Party leaders decided to devote all their efforts to preparing for the national elections, as those elected at that time would be responsible for drafting a new draft constitution.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] President Gouin was busy from morning to night in his official residence meeting with visitors to study the situation caused by the rejection of the constitutional draft.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It is announced here: After the French new constitution was rejected by referendum, the French cabinet decided to hold a meeting on the 7th to review the situation caused by the rejection of the new constitution. Observers here pointed out that the government's situation seems very delicate, as the government is a coalition of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement. The three parties had reached an agreement before the referendum that the results of the referendum would not affect the organization of the government, and it seems that this provisional agreement will be respected.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 6th] The French new constitution draft was rejected by referendum, and the left-wing group has suffered an unexpected defeat. This constitutional draft should be abandoned, or it will be thoroughly revised by the constituent assembly elected separately in June. Although there are still some colonial votes that have not been reported, their number is small and will not affect the current results. It is expected that the French political situation will not change much after this referendum, but the Communist Party has sought to strengthen its alliance with the Socialist Party, which is to be expected. Although the two parties unanimously supported the new draft constitution, the Socialist Party has repeatedly refused to merge with the Communist Party to form a coalition government, and at this time, it has again refused to conduct a joint movement with the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] London political observers believe that France's opposition to the draft constitution the day before yesterday was intended to reject the Communist Party, preventing it from leading the government again, in order to avoid the formation of a "red disaster." Therefore, the number of votes against the unicameral new constitution in the recent referendum reached more than one million, which can almost be regarded as an "anti-communist referendum."</p>

Giral said he planned to go to New York on Sunday and said he did not agree with the great powers formally interfering in Spain, hoping that foreign diplomatic and economic pressure, coupled with domestic activities, "could force Franco to step down."</p>

<h3 id="e36">"Kissing" is Popular in Japanese Dramas; Critics Believe it is Inappropriate <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Japanese famous drama critic Kawamori wrote in the Mainichi Shimbun today that there are too many kissing scenes in Japanese dramas and films currently being staged. He explained that if kissing is regarded as a democratic etiquette, he does not object, but the currently sensational dramas in Tokyo are full of kissing scenes between male and female protagonists. Kawamori also discussed this matter in detail from an aesthetic point of view, expressing doubts about whether "kissing can arouse Japanese aesthetic feelings." He pointed out that Japan has more artistic and subtle methods of expressing "charm," and Kawamori is very distressed by the younger generation's enthusiastic learning of the newly introduced simple methods. He said: Japanese people are not accustomed to kissing, and the trend of kissing is becoming more and more popular. In the future, the Japanese people will become as accustomed to public kissing as Parisians and will not care at all. He also mentioned the situation seven months ago when the strictest censorship regulations were abolished. He is very satisfied with the freedom of Japanese drama, but he is not happy with the shortening of the female singer's tights. Historically speaking, the fashion of kissing began to be introduced when the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Transport Command arrived in Japan on August 20 last year. Japanese women have always accepted the propaganda of militarists and hygiene authorities, initially thinking that kissing was "an unhygienic and strange custom," but now they have obviously overcome these fears and recognized it as one of the habits of democratic countries. It is recalled that several months ago, Japanese male and female movie stars only agreed to shoot the first kissing scene in Japanese film history after repeated persuasion.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch] London, 7th: British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that the British government has decided to completely withdraw British troops stationed in Egypt. Opposition leader Churchill and Eden immediately requested an extended meeting, and Churchill delivered a speech, saying that the British government did not consult with any party on this matter in advance, and the government should be fully responsible. Churchill spoke endlessly, and the Communist representatives shouted "Enough!" Churchill continued to talk at length, reportedly saying: "What we have worked so hard to build is now being abandoned, which is truly shameful and a mistake."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 7th] Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky broadcast yesterday that Egypt is determined to break free from the obstacles to its independence and will continue to fight to gain its due position in the international community. Egypt is currently at a serious historical period, but he is confident that it will be able to obtain its rights.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 7th] According to a statement released today, the British government has proposed that all British naval, land, and air forces will withdraw from Egypt and will discuss measures for mutual assistance in wartime or when threatened by war with the Egyptian government based on the alliance. Britain and Egypt will treat each other as equals and consolidate the alliance, which is the established policy of the British government. Now, to implement this policy, British-Egyptian negotiations have begun in a harmonious atmosphere. The British government has also suggested that the procedure and date of the British troop withdrawal should be agreed upon during the negotiations, and the formal negotiations will begin on Thursday. The withdrawal of British troops from Egypt is a relatively simple military issue, but the entire issue of defending the Middle East is a major event. Experts believe that British troops will adopt a gradual withdrawal plan so that Egypt can have time to strengthen its military and equip it with new scientific weapons. Moreover, international military figures also acknowledge that after the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, Egypt will geographically become the main country protecting the Suez Canal area, and the weaponry and combat technology of the Egyptian army are more backward than those of the British army. Therefore, during the withdrawal period, British troops need to train and reorganize the Egyptian army, and in an emergency, Egypt will be allowed to request assistance from Britain. Now, Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky is also urging the people to consider Egypt's important strategic reality and not to demand the immediate withdrawal of British troops.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Japanese War Criminals Argue for Their Lives; Although the Tricks Remain the Same, the Power is Gone <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 6th] Japanese war criminals attempted to use their usual cunning means to argue for their lives during today's trial. Although these means are similar to those used to seize power twenty years ago, the tricks remain the same, but the former power no longer exists. These people pleaded "not guilty" to a series of heinous crimes they were accused of, and their situation was as arrogant and dismissive of everything as it was in the past. However, these people are gaunt and dressed in bulky clothes, and they no longer bark well. Even the tones of command that they used to issue orders, such as the arrogance of Oshima Hiroshi or the stubbornness of Sato Kenryo, had no effect on the listeners when they uttered the words "not guilty." However, the defense lawyer of Tojo Hideki, Kiyose Ichiro, can be said to have made a strong defense by questioning the jurisdiction of the international court. Tojo previously spoke to United Press reporters in writing, defending Japan's war as "self-defense," intending to fight for it in court. However, it is not known how Kiyose will support his challenge when the court hears the defendants' defenses on June 13. It is only known that he once questioned the power of the court with the Potsdam Declaration, in an attempt to overturn all the charges of disrupting peace and violating humanity. But it is doubtful whether Kiyose or anyone else desires this kind of challenge to be established. However, this kind of legal dispute may help the defense's obvious attempt to create an effect at home and abroad, believing that the defendants' crimes were fabricated. The defendants will apparently defend themselves by saying that their major crimes were all due to the failure of the war. They will also counterattack, believing that the dropping of atomic bombs itself was "murder." In short, when the court is about to be performed, the current legal dispute may become the prelude to many exchanges between the prosecutor and the defendants, who previously refused to explain or disdain to argue when the world questioned them, and now they want to make the blood they shed in the past "justifiable."</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch, 7th] Chief Prosecutor Keenan of the War Crimes Commission here announced today that he will recommend that Matsuoka Yosuke undergo a medical examination to determine whether Matsuoka is ill and can attend court to be harmed.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Truman Submits Western Hemisphere Self-Defense Plan to Congress; Invites Canada to Participate; New Military Budget for Next Year Also Submitted <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] President Truman has submitted a bill to Congress for discussion, advocating that the U.S. Army, Navy, and State Department implement the cooperation procedures agreed upon with the Latin American republics during wartime, so that the armies of the Western Hemisphere can be standardized. The effective period of cooperation between the armed forces of the United States and Latin American countries during wartime will end at the end of next month. According to well-informed sources here, this bill focuses on expanding the current method so that the State Department can sign the Inter-American Mutual Defense Treaty with the 20 republics of the Western Hemisphere. The President also attached a message to Congress, saying that the military cooperation procedures between the United States and other American countries include the training, equipping, and organizing of the armed forces of each country. Cooperation was carried out during wartime to protect the Western Hemisphere from enemy aggression. If Canada participates, it will be very important. [Observers here are paying close attention to the level of Canada.] The President stated in his message that this mutual defense treaty will be signed at the next Pan-American Conference to be held in the capital of Brazil. The goal is to standardize the training and equipping of the armies of the signatory countries in accordance with the recommendations of the Inter-American Mutual Defense Committee. Regarding the command of the Western Hemisphere defense, the United States bears greater responsibility due to its particularly important position in terms of technology, economy, and military. However, all actions must be subject to a restriction, that is, the restrictions that the United States may stipulate in the future when it participates in an international arms control treaty. Finally, the President also emphasized that the United States intends to simultaneously cooperate in improving the economic conditions of the American republics in order to improve the living standards of the Western Hemisphere. In addition, the United States will do its best to prevent anyone who wants to use weapons to violate peace-loving democrats.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 6th] President Truman today submitted to Congress the budget for the military plan for the fiscal year 1947, stipulating an expense of $7,246,335,100. This budget plan maintains the strength of the army, reducing from 1,550,000 people on June 30, 1946, to 1,070,000 people by the end of June 1947. In addition to maintaining this army strength, the budget stipulates $500 million for the cost of the government and relief of the occupied areas and $200 million for the atomic work, formerly known as the "Manhattan Project." In addition, funds are reserved for the demobilization of the National Guard and the Reserve.</p>

<p>[U.S. Information Service, New York, 6th] The U.S. Rubber Company has recently invented a new type of rubber mailbag. It is claimed that this mailbag can prevent air cargo dropped by planes, from hardware to eggs, from being damaged. This mailbag can be dropped or picked up in small places without the need for the plane to land, thus enabling airmail to be delivered directly to places without airport facilities.</p>

<p>[Remodeling Daily News, Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese government, in a regular cabinet meeting today, decided to convene the 90th Diet on the 16th, with a session of 40 days. At the same time, the Imperial edict convening the Diet will be promulgated. This Diet will not take the form of a special session after the general election but will be convened as a provisional Diet under Article 43 of the Constitution. Also, this edict will follow the draft constitution, abandoning the ancient and abstruse style of the past and changing to plain and easy-to-understand language, with new-style punctuation and letters changed to hiragana.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] This upcoming provisional session of the Japanese Diet is of historical importance, as it is expected that the establishment of democracy in Japan will be decided at this session, and the new constitution will be discussed and enacted.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th] Today, a tug-of-war struggle arose among the left-wing parties and the Socialist Party in Japan over the right to organize the new cabinet. The Communist Party accused the leaders of the Socialist Party of being "war criminals." At the same time, a spokesman for MacArthur Headquarters issued a statement saying that the Allied nations hope that the Japanese government will make good use of the dismissal of Mr. Hatoyama Ichiro, the leader of the Liberal Party. Brigadier General Whitney, head of the Government Section of MacArthur Headquarters, stated: "MacArthur deeply feels that Japan's political problems should be decided by the Japanese." He also said that if the Japanese government fails to act in accordance with clearly explained instructions, Headquarters reserves the right to intervene. Mr. Whitney also expressed the hope that the dismissal of Mr. Hatoyama, the leader of the Liberal Party and former candidate for prime minister, will be beneficial to the future actions of the government. "Until a new cabinet is formed, the Japanese government remains the Shidehara cabinet," he said.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Chennault Quietly Returns to America After Two Months in China, Plan Fails to Materialize, Reason for Leaving China Not Disclosed, All Parties Express Surprise and Regret <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>General Chennault, famous throughout the world as the hero of the Flying Tigers, has been in China for more than two months since his arrival last month. The purpose of his coming was to make another career, but unfortunately, his planning failed and was blocked by all parties. In the past two months, although there were many plans, they could not be implemented as desired. General Chen, who is already fifty years old, felt quite pessimistic and frustrated about this and quietly left Shanghai yesterday morning to return directly to Washington. Before leaving, he met with a reporter from the Central News Agency and firmly refused to disclose the reason for his departure. When asked whether he would come to China again, he did not answer. All parties expressed surprise and regret at General Chen's sudden departure. Mr. Chen originally intended to recall the old members of his Flying Tigers team to reorganize the air transport team and once told reporters that "this time I will go to China to inspect the valley, and the work plan has not been determined," but it is generally speculated that Mr. Chen may organize a commercial airline. Unfortunately, due to various problems, it was not realized. It was also once rumored that General Chen would help us train the air force, but it also became a bubble. Recently, the UNRRA executive headquarters planned to cooperate with Mr. Chen to form an air transport team to transport relief materials to various disaster areas, especially for the purpose of medical relief. The light weight of medicines makes air transportation very suitable. When U.S. Relief Envoy Hoover came to China, he greatly approved of Mr. Chen's plan and urged all parties to help him realize it to make up for the inadequacy of water and land transportation. However, after repeated consultations among all parties, it still failed to be implemented as planned, and Mr. Chen said goodbye to China yesterday morning because his plan failed to materialize. Mr. Chen did not disclose the reason for his return to the United States, and UNRRA and the Executive Headquarters also did not comment on Mr. Chen's departure from China. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Chen helped us train the air force in Hangzhou. In 1941, he formed the Air Transport Volunteer Team to participate in the war in China and was deeply admired by President Chiang and his wife. In 1942, he was ordered by the U.S. government to reorganize the Volunteer Team into the U.S. 14th Air Force, expand the organization, establish bases in various regions in the rear, and give the Japanese air force a head-on blow. At that time, the people in the inland areas admired the great achievements of General Chennault's air force staff and praised them as the "Flying Tigers," whose fame spread far and wide. A month before the Japanese surrendered, Mr. Chen left the 14th Air Force and returned to the United States for personal reasons, but he was deeply attached to China, where he had lived for eight years, so he voluntarily came to China again in early spring of this year. However, his ambition was not fulfilled, and now he is reported to have left again. Mr. Chen retired last year but still retains the rank of U.S. Army Major General.</p>
<h3 id="e61">French Cruiser Arrives in Shanghai to Evacuate Overseas Chinese <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, the French 10,000-ton liner "Duquesne" arrived in Shanghai and docked in the Huangpu River, staying in Shanghai for about a week. The ship usually has 750 crew members. This time, because French overseas Chinese and soldiers in Shanghai are being sent back to their country, the number of crew members has been reduced to 500 and 22 officers to free up cabin space to facilitate the evacuation of overseas Chinese. The ship is one of the French Navy's giant ships, equipped with eight large cannons, eight 75-caliber cannons, and 28 anti-aircraft cannons. During the war, it participated in naval patrols in the South Atlantic, searching for German ships. Later, it assisted the French army in repelling the Germans in the North Atlantic, repeatedly making great achievements.</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Sea Dike in Pudong Is in Critical Condition, the Municipal Government Starts Emergency Repairs, Bidding for Some Materials Starts Today <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The sea dike in Pudong, Shanghai, has been in disrepair for many years, with eight breaches washed away, extending for more than four kilometers. The situation is serious. According to Mr. Tang, the chief secretary of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, if the sea dike is not repaired this year, the manpower cost for repairs next year will be several times that of today. If seawater erodes the farmland, it will not be easy to restore it within ten years. If the damage to the dike is ignored, Pudong will become a sea in fifty years.</p>
<p>After research by the Bureau of Public Works and other parties, repairing the eight breaches in the sea dike requires a cost of 3 billion yuan. It has been decided that the Executive Yuan, the Municipal Government, and the Executive Headquarters will share the cost jointly. For emergency rescue purposes, it is planned to first repair the section south of the seaside bathing beach, which will cost 1.2 billion yuan. The 400 million yuan that the Municipal Government should allocate has been approved. The Bureau is requesting the Executive Headquarters to allocate some of the materials for repairing the dike.</p>
<p>The Bureau has also scheduled to start public bidding for large and small gravel, wood piles, sand, wire nails, asphalt, etc., from today (8th). The bidding will be opened within one week, and then the goods will be delivered separately within 30 to 50 days so that construction can start immediately.</p>

It has now obtained the consent of the bank's head office and will start providing loans from today. The procedures are very simple, and the interest rate is only four cents per month. Fishermen and fish merchants who have fishing boats engaged in fishing, purchasing, breeding, or processing and manufacturing can apply for loans from the market.</p>

The Bureau also plans to prepare to install 3,000 streetlights on various roads within the next three months to facilitate traffic. As soon as the materials are available, construction will begin. Also, the Bureau has found that the streetlights on the tram platforms are not well installed, which easily causes them to be damaged by vehicles. Recently, experts have designed various styles and are trying to install them separately.</p>

<p>[Our Report] According to the announcement by the Port Headquarters, the number of Japanese prisoners of war and nationals who have been sent away as of yesterday is 495,624. Recently, due to the prevalence of cholera, Japanese prisoners of war who are concentrated in this city from various places must wait for six days before boarding the ship if no symptoms occur, so the transportation work may be affected.

In addition, five batches of Koreans have also been sent away, totaling 14,473. It is estimated that another 3,130 will be sent away today.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The British Taikoo Company's Hubei, Jinan, and Fuzhou ships have been in Shanghai for many days. Due to the crew problem, the cargo has not been unloaded. The situation has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the crew of the Hubei ship are all Chinese and should not be involved, so they have obtained the permission of the Seamen's Union and started to unload the cargo yesterday afternoon, and are scheduled to sail to Hong Kong on the 10th. The routes of the Jinan and Fuzhou ships have been assigned. The Jinan ship will sail to Xiamen and Hong Kong, and the Fuzhou ship will sail to Guangzhou. Due to the unresolved crew problem, the sailing dates have not been determined. For the cargo that is easy to rot, such as fruits, the Seamen's Union has been accommodating and has allowed it to be unloaded. Other commercial goods are still on board. The above problem had not been resolved as of 5:00 p.m. yesterday. China Merchants Bureau will receive two new ships soon, and the crew lists were announced yesterday. The captain of the Linsen (formerly Hailian) is Zhang Yu, the chief mate is Wang Jingfang, the second mate is Wang Jing, and the chief engineer is Cao Atang.

<p>[Our Report] After the victory, the establishment of private radio stations in the city has surged, reaching about 120 so far. Inevitably, some have been rushed and improvised. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications has promulgated regulations to reorganize the broadcasting industry in the city, ordering all radio stations to register. Those that do not comply will be banned. The registration will be closed on the 10th of this month. A reporter visited the person in charge yesterday, who said: The number of radio stations in major cities around the world has never been as high as it is in Shanghai today. Foreigners are surprised when they hear about it. Since the Ministry of Communications decided to reorganize it, about 100 have registered so far. Officials are being sent to investigate each one. The Ministry of Communications originally stipulated that only ten private radio stations would be allowed to be established in the city. However, in view of the special circumstances, the quota may be relaxed and slightly increased.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Broadcasting Technology Equipment <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to Mr. Costandi, director of the news broadcasting group of the Tianguo Columbia Broadcasting Company, the lack of various technical equipment in China's broadcasting industry makes it difficult for China to conduct external propaganda and greatly affects its position in international radio. Mr. Costandi stated that China is a permanent member of the United Nations and one of the world's major powers, so it should occupy a prominent position in international radio. However, China's neighboring countries, even Japan, which has been defeated, have better shortwave broadcasting equipment than China. Therefore, it is hoped that China will establish complete broadcasting equipment to directly broadcast news to the world. Mr. Costandi came to Shanghai from the United States this week to find a rich location in the East to set up a Far East branch for the company in order to provide the United States with a full range of news broadcasting programs. It was initially planned to set up the Far East branch in Shanghai, but it is now felt that the city lacks excellent radio broadcasting equipment, and it is likely to be abandoned.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The High Court's Provisional Criminal Tribunal yesterday morning heard two cases of suspected traitors: (1) Shu Jin'gen, a 40-year-old from Zhenjiang, residing at 127 Qiu Jiang Road, operates a tea house. He previously held positions within the enemy-controlled Central China Railway Company and the enemy's 1629th Unit. On January 23rd of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], at approximately 9:00 PM, he led four enemy military police officers to arrest Xu Fuliang and Xu Fushan, falsely accusing them of buying copper and iron, forcing them to confess. They were detained for two weeks, eventually settling the matter by paying compensation in iron bars. Shu then extorted 110,000 fake currency from Xu Fuliang. On February 14th of the same year, he again led enemy military police, using the pretext of buying silver bars, to detain Ma Jinlin, Xu Yihe, Chen Daode, Tian Xinchun, and others in the enemy's 1629th Unit for ten days. They were released only after paying compensation in silver bars, with Shu extorting 220,000 fake currency from Ma Jinlin, 50,000 from Xu Yihe, and 150,000 from Chen Daode. After the victory, Xu Fuliang and five others filed a lawsuit, and the police department arrested him and transferred him to the High Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Liu Yugui opened the court for questioning. The defendant, dressed in a short shirt, black upper garment, blue cloth trousers, and black cloth shoes, appeared seemingly honest but stubbornly argued, claiming he was being falsely accused. After Presiding Judge Liu summoned witnesses for questioning, he announced a postponement for further hearing. (2) Ye Zhihua, a 43-year-old from Nanjing, residing at No. 1 Maiqi New Village, Maiqi Road. In January of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he joined a puppet organization, serving as the Deputy Director of the Hongkou Collection Office of the Baoshan District Tax Collection Bureau of the puppet Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for over four months. As Ye was the second landlord of Xia Qifeng, a puppet secret service cadre, when the Military Intelligence Bureau arrested the traitor Xia, they discovered that Ye was also a puppet official and arrested him as well. The trial was opened by Judge Qiu yesterday morning. The defendant directly admitted to holding the puppet position, only claiming that he had not harmed the people. Judge Qiu, believing that the case still required investigation, announced a postponement for further hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>The Li Ze Case Will Be Reopened for Debate</p>
<p>The case of Li Ze, the General Manager of the New New Company, was originally scheduled for sentencing yesterday afternoon, but due to the complexity of the case, the High Court, in order to handle it with caution, decided to reopen the collegial panel for debate in order to seek a fair legal process.</p>
<p>The High Court Will Bring Cai Pei for Trial the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>The High Procuratorate yesterday investigated cases of suspected traitors, including Chou Shuxian, Yang Shouzhang, Lu Xiangjin, Chang Rixin, Wang Lubin, Liu Zhenqun, Ge Shengwen, Li Haoju, Zhu Yizi, Shen Junping, Zhu Zhongdun, Li Chunrong, Gong Jianxun, Cao Rong, Ha Junxin, Ruan Xingzhou, Wu Guozhi, Qian Xiaomin, Cheng Peter, and others.

<p>Sun Huimin Sentenced to Four Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sun Huimin, a clerk at the Shaoxing office of the puppet Central Reserve Bank, was sentenced by the High Court yesterday to four years of imprisonment, four years of deprivation of civil rights, and confiscation of property for colluding with the enemy and disrupting finance.</p>
<p>Qu Zhanggui Suspected of Being a Traitor</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the case of Cui Zhanggui, the Deputy Manager of the Red Star Theater, being abducted the night before last, according to further information, Cui was arrested by the city's Procuratorate. The reason for his arrest is suspicion of being a traitor. It is reported that during the period when the enemy and puppets occupied the area, Cui served as the leader of the guards for the Hua Min gambling den and was also an apprentice of Shen Yinshui, the host of the den. At the same time, he served as a detective in the puppet police bureau, acting as an accomplice for tigers and oppressing the good people. Recently, victims Wu Zhonghua, Wang Agen, and others reported him to the District Procuratorate. The Procuratorate ordered plainclothes judicial police to rush to arrest him the night before last, and without showing an arrest warrant, they dragged him onto a car and left. Afterwards, Cui's wife reported the situation to the Penglai Branch Bureau, stating that her husband had been taken away for no reason.</p>

<p>The ancestral shrine of Wang Yangming, the great Confucian scholar of the Ming Dynasty, is located on Longshan Mountain in the north of Yuyao city. Inside is a stone statue of the Master, over ten feet tall, with facial features closely resembling the portrait that has been passed down. The people of the city greatly cherished it. Since Yuyao fell into enemy hands, Longshan Mountain became an enemy observation post, and the statue was transported away by the enemy, and the site of the shrine was completely destroyed. Now, Huang [blank space]mei, a professor at Shanghai Temporary University and a native of the city, has telegraphed the Ministry of Education, detailing the circumstances of the statue's abduction and the importance of its loss, requesting that swift measures be taken to transport the statue back to its original shrine and to order Japan to compensate for all losses to rebuild the shrine. It is reported that the Ministry of Education, considering the matter to be related to the survival of cultural heritage, telegraphed Professor Huang three days ago, stating that it had separately sent letters to the Army General Headquarters and the Executive Yuan, transferring them for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Soochow-Nanking Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Strenuously Promotes Work Relief: Repairing Seawalls and Dredging the Jiangnan Canal <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Lu Zidong, Director of the Soochow-Nanking Branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, recently arrived in Shanghai from Zhenjiang. He told our newspaper reporter: The general office of the branch is located in Zhenjiang, and the scope of work includes the entire province of Jiangsu (excluding Shanghai, including Nanjing). It officially started work on January 16th of this year. The most important work at present is to use work relief methods to (1) repair the Jiangnan seawalls, and (2) dredge the Jiangnan Canal. The work covers twenty counties. For example, in Zhenjiang, Wujin, Jurong, Gaochun, Yangzhou, Yizheng, Yixing, Xuzhou, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Kunshan, and other counties, they are either building river embankments or dredging river channels; most of the projects started in late March and mid-April. The Jiangnan seawalls, from Jinshanwei, through Songjiang, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Shanghai, Jinshan, Taicang, to Changshu Fushan, will all be repaired selectively. This part of the project started on March 6th; Changshu, Chuansha, Taicang, and Fengxian have already rushed to complete 24,773 cubic meters of earthwork and 18 cubic meters of stonework. Currently, the number of people working on work relief projects in various places is approximately 30,000. If the relief materials can be fully supplied, the number of work relief workers can be increased to 100,000. The flour issued for work relief has reached 5,000 tons. Relief work is now also being carried out in various counties. Old clothes are distributed to teachers and staff of national primary schools everywhere, and it is estimated that more than 50,000 people are affected. The number of children and infants receiving milk rations is above 7,000. Although the branch has not received many medical supplies, it still selects hospitals with free beds and distributes milk, medicine, and other items according to the number of beds. Twenty hospitals have benefited. In terms of agriculture, the branch has distributed cotton seeds to farmers in Nantong, Taicang, Nanjing, and Xuzhou. At Baihuazhou in Nanjing, the branch mobilized more than 4,000 farmers through work relief methods to remove more than 20,000 taels of rice borers. Currently, due to security reasons, the branch's promotion of relief work in northern Jiangsu is not without difficulties. However, in the Huaiyin area, personnel from the "Joint Relief" have recently gone there together with the branch's personnel, bringing a large number of relief supplies to help the people there. It is reported that there are now as many as 700,000 to 800,000 refugees in the northern Jiangsu area of Xuzhou, Haizhou, Taizhou, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang, most of whom are intellectuals and cannot be helped by work relief methods. In Nanjing, the branch is in charge of the work of the Refugee Relief Committee, providing relief to the righteous people sent to Nanjing from Sichuan, Guizhou, and other places.</p>

<p>The person in charge of the Shanghai Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday that the purpose of the committee's establishment is to reasonably and uniformly allocate houses formerly occupied by enemy foreigners, and to maintain the status quo before allocation. It has already been publicly announced. It has been reported that there are still a few unscrupulous people colluding with scattered soldiers and rogue elements, and incidents of illegally occupying houses occur from time to time, which is illegal. The committee has ordered the investigation and execution groups to strictly investigate and severely punish them. In addition, the committee is scheduled to hold its fifth meeting at 9:00 AM today to discuss the principles for allocating houses left by enemy foreigners and other internal matters of the committee. The date for formally deciding on the allocation of houses is still pending.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The case of Wang Guoying, a woman from Beiping, jointly defrauding other people's property with Sun Gongdu and Zhang Weisheng, has been prosecuted by the District Court Procuratorate. Wang, 35 years old, claimed to be a specialist at the National Government's Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, living at Room 714 of the Jinmen Hotel, and lived in a lavish manner. Her fellow villager, Sun Gongdu (male, 44 years old), came to Shanghai in February of this year and lived at the home of his friend Zhang Weisheng (male, 47 years old, from Beidongzhou) at 345 Weihaiwei Road. They discussed this person with Zhang. It happened that his neighbor, Wu Yonghua, was detained by a military organization on suspicion of being a traitor. Wu's family then asked Wang to find a way to rescue him. Wang demanded 5 million national currency, saying that his release could be expected in a few days. Therefore, Zhang contacted Wu's wife, Yu Xinggeng. On April 3rd, Sun's wife handed Wang 3 million national currency. On April 5th, Xu Zouqiaoying handed Zhang 900,000 national currency, US$250, and four taels of gold, totaling 2 million, but they waited for a long time without seeing his release. Wu and Yu suspected that they had been cheated at that time. On April 9th, Zhang again proposed to Wu and Yu that they needed 50 million in activity expenses and two cars. Wu's brother, Wu Bingquan, took over the management of the matter, wrote a promissory note stating that it was borrowed from Wang Guoying, and agreed to release him on April 20th. Later, Wu's family saw in the newspaper that Wu had been transferred to the High Procuratorate and knew that there was no hope of release. At the same time, Sun demanded that Wang split the 5 million of stolen money equally but failed. On the morning of April 26th, the police bureau was informed and arrested Wang Guoying and sent him to the District Court Procuratorate for investigation. Wang Guoying firmly denied it, but the prosecutor, based on the statements of all relevant persons in the case, clearly showed that she had a significant suspicion of defrauding others of property by fraud. Sun Gongdu's attempt to obtain the stolen goods was unsuccessful, and he conspired to retaliate. Zhang Weisheng committed the crime of jointly defrauding others of property. Therefore, he was prosecuted according to law and will be tried in the District Court soon.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Import and Export Trade Has Many Difficulties: Imported Goods Are Cheap and Popular <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, many import and export merchants reported their resumption of business, but because my country's currency system is not yet determined, there are many difficulties in import and export trade. Especially for my country's export goods, the difference is much greater than before the Anti-Japanese War. Today, it has become a phenomenon of many imports and few exports. Zhang Huanzhang, Chairman of the Shanghai Import and Export Bank Commercial Association, told reporters yesterday that the ratio of imports to exports is currently 100 to 1. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, China's export products included raw silk and pig bristles, but their quality was far worse than before, and they were not favored by foreign countries. In addition, the freight is extremely expensive and the cost is too high, so the price is several times more expensive than before the war. The sales areas are the United States and Southeast Asia, but exports are very small. There are many imported goods, mainly building materials and daily commodities. In addition, Chinese factories have stopped work and have no products, and imported goods are cheaper than domestic goods, so imported goods are very popular. Zhang also mentioned mobile housing. It is said that an order has been placed with the United States, but the United States also has a housing panic, so it cannot provide much supply. It only allows 100 mobile housing units to be shipped this year, and the first batch may arrive within one or two months.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Completed its Sacred Mission During the Anti-Japanese War: Red Cross Expanding its Business <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War—Red Cross rescue teams advanced shoulder to shoulder with the brave soldiers on the front lines, braving enemy fire, regardless of danger, sparing no sacrifice, and striving to accomplish rescue missions; the Rescue Red Cross engaged in treatment and relief work, establishing hospitals and clinics, preventing diseases, and guiding hygiene knowledge! These extensive and popular services to the public are also the only sacred mission. The Chinese Red Cross has left a glorious and indelible page in the victorious history of the Anti-Japanese War!</p>
<p>Long History</p>
<p>It was already forty-two years ago, when the Russo-Japanese War broke out in the 30th year of the Guangxu Emperor [1904], that the elders of this city and British and American people felt the need for rescue work, so they gathered their strength and founded the Red Cross Society. Thus, the "Foreign Red Cross Society" was established in this city, which was dedicated to the rescue and treatment of wounded soldiers. This was the early stage of the Chinese Red Cross Society. In any war, flood, drought, natural disaster, fire, or theft that occurred in my country over the years, as well as during the prevalence of epidemics and diseases, the Red Cross Society invariably did what was right, undertaking the most urgent and important relief and rescue work. During the reign of the Xuantong Emperor, the name of the Red Cross Society changed the word "Foreign" to "Great Qing". It was not until after the Wuchang Uprising and the establishment of the National Government that the "Great Qing Red Cross Society" changed to its current name—the Chinese Red Cross Society. At that time, it still adhered to its original purpose of always seeking the welfare of mankind.</p>
<p>Moving Inward Repeatedly</p>
<p>After the "August 13th" War officially began, when the artillery fire was continuous and the National Army and compatriots were dying in large numbers, the Red Cross rescue team arrived. Disregarding danger, sparing no sacrifice, in the enemy's artillery fire, under the rain of bullets, they engaged in the sacred work of rescuing wounded soldiers. On November 1st of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], feeling the special environment of Shanghai, they withdrew westward to Nanjing with the National Army and established the "Capital Hospital" in Nanjing, which broke world records. The hospital had 5,000 beds and continued to accommodate the glorious National Army wounded in the Anti-Japanese War. However, when there were only over 3,000 honorary wounded soldiers lying on the beds, the enemy's artillery fire was already following them to attack Nanjing. Thus, Nanjing was also devastated by the Japanese invaders, and the Red Cross Society was forced to painfully leave the Capital Hospital, which had only been established for a month and a half. On November 7th of the same year, it moved its headquarters from Nanjing to Hankou. At that time, Du Yuesheng, the Vice President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, had just arrived in Hankou from Shanghai and held an important meeting in Hankou to decide to organize a mobile rescue team. Under the principle of breaking up into smaller units, the doctors and nurses in the society were divided into more than 110 mobile teams to serve the National Army under a rain of bullets. On November 1st of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], the Red Cross Society was forced to move to Changsha again. In November of the same year, it retreated west to Qiyang with the National Army. Because the equipment in Qiyang was simple and rescue work could not be carried out, it withdrew to Guiyang in early March of the 28th year of the Republic [1939]. At the same time, the General Office was established in Hong Kong. Later, due to the pressing environment, it finally moved to Chongqing, and the General Association was also established in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Rescuing the Dying and Healing the Wounded</p>
<p>On May 3rd and May 4th of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], when enemy planes flew to Chongqing and bombed wantonly, the number of compatriots killed and injured was staggering and unbearable to witness. The Red Cross Society firmly raised the Red Cross flag and continued rescue work. In this way, until the spring of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], with the efforts of the service staff, Chongqing had a complete relief hospital and also established a clinic. During this period, the Chongqing General Association had lost contact with the branch associations in the occupied areas, but in various places in the rear, 98 branch associations had been established, and rescue work was finally proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>Expanding Services</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the government launched the repatriation work, and the Red Cross Society also responded and moved to Nanjing. Recently, it has resumed contact with branch associations in various places and established two hospitals on Haige Road and Xinzha Road. A clinic was established at the Shanghai Branch Association (No. 865 Xinzha Road) a few days ago, specializing in serving the poor and sick. In order to expand its business and serve humanity, it decided to launch a membership recruitment conference on the 10th of this month and invited Mayor Qian Dajun to serve as the general captain, and Xu Jili and Wang Xiaolai as the deputy general captains. The association is actively carrying out citizen health care work in accordance with its purpose of serving mankind, adding hospitals and clinics, adopting a medical patrol system, providing free vaccinations, and carrying out health guidance and health examinations. In order to meet the urgent needs of society, the association will establish a medical and health training class, specializing in training health talents to serve the society and effectively relieve poor compatriots.</p>

<p>Presenting Three Concrete Measures</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Guiyang by This Newspaper] The professors' associations of National Guizhou University, Guiyang Medical College, and Teachers College issued a declaration to request improved treatment, stating: "Education is the foundation of a nation, and culture is crucial for survival. European and American countries, even during wartime, strived to provide generous treatment to teachers, enabling them to dedicate themselves to scholarship and maintain cultural standards. During our country's war of resistance, the income of our colleagues was insufficient to provide even basic sustenance. Their minds were occupied with saving lives, and their strength was exhausted in enduring poverty. Scholarly achievements have declined, a fact that cannot be concealed. However, they remained steadfast in their positions, never complaining, solely because they prioritized national hardship and patiently awaited better times. Now that the war has been won and the people are starting anew, they hope to live without worries and restore normalcy. Yet, the treatment of our colleagues remains the same as during wartime, while prices have risen even higher than before. In-kind subsidies have been canceled, and preferential measures have not been implemented. Research is nominally funded, but not enough to subscribe to newspapers. Rewards are nominally given, but only enough to buy a hat. Illnesses cannot be treated, and children cannot be educated. At home, family members complain; outside, servants show disrespect. Moral arguments cannot overcome public opinion, and academic interests cannot attract listeners. The academic standards of Europe and America are already high, and with years of encouragement, they continue to advance. The academic foundation of our country is weak, and after suffering many setbacks, it continues to decline. Comparing the two is disheartening! Furthermore, among public employees, those working in production and financial institutions enjoy housing, servants, seniority bonuses, entertainment expenses, fuel subsidies, and flexible arrangements with various nominal titles. Even those in such positions can arrogantly look down upon professors. With such measures, how can we speak of respecting teachers or valuing the Dao? Mencius said: 'If superiors lack propriety, and inferiors lack learning, insurrection will arise, and the loss of the state will not be far off.' If society views scholarship as worthless, and the government treats it as mere food, the trend will inevitably lead to everyone abandoning integrity and virtue. What will it lead to? Thinking of the future, we are deeply worried! Our colleagues are mindful of the difficult responsibilities and the importance of not shaking the foundation of the nation. What they hope from the government is: (1) To adjust salaries according to the price index to ensure stable living conditions. (2) To increase research funding in line with price increases to facilitate academic development. (3) To establish preferential treatment measures for educational personnel in border areas to avoid a bias in talent. These three points should be resolved and implemented quickly. Otherwise, if we only show superficial sympathy while harboring neglect, and merely decorate the facade and procrastinate, the unfortunate result will be a nationwide teacher strike. Who will sow the seeds, and who will bear the blame? What our hearts feel is dangerous, and we cannot bear to say it!"</p>

<p>Route to Traverse Vietnam by Sea</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Kunming by This Newspaper] The Sino-French University is scheduled to hold its semester exams from the 6th to the 10th of this month. Once the exams are completed, preparations will begin for relocating the university. The school buildings in Beiping were partially occupied by the puppet Peking University during the war and partially used as the headquarters of the Japanese military police. Currently, all except for some faculty dormitories have been recovered. However, the losses of books and equipment are significant. The university's College of Science has the most renowned instruments among universities nationwide. Besides those transported to Kunming, some were kept in Vietnam under the care of the French. After the school relocates, they can all be used. The relocation route will likely pass through Vietnam, with the French responsible for transporting the equipment from Haiphong to Tianjin and then to Beiping. Negotiations are currently underway with the French consulate. The Ministry of Education has allocated 150 million yuan to the university for relocation expenses. The university's affiliated high school, formerly the Kunming Sino-French High School, will remain in Kunming. Some of the university's equipment will be left for use by the high school. The university president, Li Linwang, was placed under house arrest in Tianjin by the enemy during the war and was unable to leave. He will now come to Kunming with school trustee Li Shuhua to oversee the relocation.</p>

<p>Proposed Monthly Allowance of 8,000 Yuan Per Student</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou by This Newspaper] The total number of publicly funded students in normal and vocational schools in Zhejiang Province reaches 8,960. Previously, the Ministry of Education stipulated a quota of 6,940 students, with a monthly meal allowance of 5,000 yuan per student. This allowance, when averaged, provides only 4,000 yuan per student. At a time when rice prices have soared to 50,000 yuan, this amount is hardly enough to provide sustenance. School authorities feel helpless, and the students, mostly survivors of the war with impoverished families, cannot afford to pay for meals. As a result, several disturbances have already occurred. The school principals have repeatedly appealed to the provincial education department without finding a solution. In addition to previous requests to the Ministry of Education for assistance, the department cabled the ministry on the 4th of this month with two requests: (1) The meal allowance for students in provincial normal and vocational schools should be increased to 8,000 yuan per month, in line with the standard for normal school students at Zhejiang University. (2) The meal allowance should be calculated based on the actual number of publicly funded normal and vocational school students in the province, so that the schools can continue to operate.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing by China News Agency] The Central University Rehabilitation Committee recently resolved six matters regarding the rehabilitation: (1) The children of Central University public employees must obtain proof from the parent's work unit that they have not yet received repatriation expenses and have certification from two professors before travel expenses can be issued. (2) The travel expense standards previously stipulated for faculty, staff, and their direct relatives returning to Nanjing on their own have been slightly adjusted. Employees and technical assistants are now eligible for 80,000 yuan, and each direct relative and spouse is also eligible for 80,000 yuan. Children are eligible for 70,000 yuan. Those returning to Nanjing with the school will be given third-class tickets for their parents, spouses, and children, and expenses will be subsidized accordingly. (3) Students on medical leave who are still receiving public funding will be strictly reviewed by the Student Affairs Office. (4) Students on medical leave who live on campus or are being treated in hospitals at their own expense will be assisted by the school to the extent possible. (5) Units with hazardous chemicals should stop packing. Those that have already packed flammable or other hazardous chemicals should concentrate them in Classroom 14 and store them carefully to ensure safety. (6) Luggage for those relocating to Nanjing with the school will be transported by school-provided vehicles, but they must be collectively cared for. It is reported that 3,000 people from the school will return to Nanjing by water this month, accounting for nearly one-third of the total repatriation volume of the Yangtze River Shipping. On the 1st of this month, the Minxie Wheel departed eastward, and the school's rehabilitation committee assigned 126 students and 90 faculty and staff members. Over one hundred male faculty and staff members will fly to Nanjing by military plane.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Hangzhou by This Newspaper] National Yingshi University was temporarily relocated to Yongjia due to the war. Recently, the Ministry of Education ordered that the entire school be moved to Jinhua and instructed them to select a permanent site. The school sent personnel to Jinhua to survey the vacant land near the Pagoda Temple in the urban area as the school site. They are now preparing a budget and submitting it to the Ministry of Education for funding to begin construction. Students from the College of Engineering, College of Law, and College of Arts and Sciences are preparing to start classes in Jinhua during the summer vacation.</p>
<h3 id="e94">National Advanced Agricultural School to Move from Chongqing to Chengjiang; Xiagang Selected as Site <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Jiangyin by This Newspaper] In order to train specialized agricultural talent, the Ministry of Education established the National Advanced Agricultural School in the wartime capital of Chongqing this year. It is now planned to move it to Jiangsu and find suitable school buildings and farms. On the 3rd of this month, the school's professor Gu Yiting came to Chengjiang and, together with Xu Jianwen of the Education Section, surveyed the Puji Hall and Yejian Temple, located ten li from the city, as potential sites. However, the number of [buildings] is still insufficient. A decision will be made after consulting with the Ministry of Education. If the site is deemed suitable, the school will move from Chongqing to Chengjiang. (Xi)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Professor at Xikang Vocational Technical School Designs and Builds a Meridian Platform to Indicate Time Using Sunlight <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Xichang by China News Agency] Li Chuanhe, a professor at the National Xikang Vocational Technical School, recently designed and built a meridian platform at the school that can indicate time. According to Mr. Li, the construction method of the platform is as follows: (1) First, measure the North Star to obtain true north (not magnetic north) and determine the angle of inclination of the Xichang local plane to the Earth's axis. (2) Create a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis. (3) Erect a vertical needle on this plane. The direction of this needle is the direction of the Earth's axis. The Earth rotates on its axis, so the plane of the sun's apparent movement around the Earth should be parallel to the plane described in item (2). (4) Draw a semicircle on the plane and divide the semicircle into twelve equal parts, representing twelve hours of daylight. Divide each hour into two, representing half an hour. When the sun shines on the needle, the direction of the needle indicates the true local time (twenty minutes later than Chongqing time because Chongqing is at 105 degrees east longitude, while Xichang is at 102 degrees east longitude). The platform is now built below the mountain at the school. Since its completion, students without watches find it very convenient. However, it cannot indicate the time on cloudy days or at night, which is a regrettable shortcoming.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Overview of Anhui Province's Educational Rehabilitation; Director Wang of the Education Department Returns to the Province from Nanjing and Gives a Speech <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Hefei by This Newspaper] Wang Shaolun, Director of the Anhui Education Department, was summoned to Nanjing by the Ministry of Education on the 8th of last month to attend a discussion meeting on the rehabilitation of national secondary schools. He returned to Hefei on the 26th. This reporter recently visited Director Wang, who delivered the following speech:</p>
<p>Secondary School Rehabilitation</p>
<p>In the early stages of the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education established many national secondary schools to provide relief to unemployed youth who had fled from the war zones to the rear. The Eighth and Ninth Secondary Schools were specifically established for youth from Anhui who had fled to Sichuan and Hunan and lost their schooling. In order for students and staff from Anhui to return home as soon as possible, the department made preparations for their return to Anhui as soon as the war ended. The entire relocation plan and measures were formulated and implemented before I was ordered to go to Nanjing. At the meeting held at the ministry on the 15th of last month, it was generally agreed that the plans and measures proposed by the department were feasible. It was decided that female students from the National [Eighth] Secondary School would be relocated to Wuhu to establish the Wuhu Provincial Girls' High School, male students from northern Anhui would be relocated to Taihe to establish the Taihe Provincial High School, male students from central and southern Anhui would be relocated to Guichi to establish the Guichi Provincial High School, female students from the National Ninth Secondary School would be relocated to Anqing to establish the Anqing Provincial Girls' High School, male students from northern Anhui would be relocated to Su County to establish the Su County Provincial High School, male students from central and southern Anhui would be relocated to Dongliu to establish the Dongliu Provincial High School, and the normal school section of the Eighth Secondary School, together with students from the Cha Wan Normal School and Anhui Normal School, would be relocated to Dangtu to establish the Dangtu Provincial Normal School. [All] students from Anhui [studying at the] National Sixteenth Secondary School [will be transferred to] Tongling [to join the] provincial [Tongling High School]. In addition, the Water Conservancy Engineering School, which was operated by the [National] Water Conservancy Commission in Sichuan, has also been decided to be relocated to Bengbu. Furthermore, according to a telegram sent by the Dongqian Labor Normal School, Anhui welcomes its relocation to Anhui to establish a school in Suhu or [Ling] County to train primary school labor teachers needed by the province. All faculty and staff who come to Anhui with the school will be assigned to serve in the above-mentioned schools as a principle. If there is a surplus, further arrangements will be made to ensure that no one loses their job.</p>
<p>Anhui University</p>
<p>The conversion of Anhui University into a national university has long been approved by the Executive Yuan. The members of the preparatory committee have also been appointed by the Ministry of Education. The first preparatory meeting was held in Nanjing on the 20th of last month. The members present included Yang Lianggong, Cheng Yansheng, Zhang Yousan, Ye Yuanlong, Tao Yin, Liu Yingshi, Liu Zhenru, Wang Peiren, and myself. The absent members were Zhu Guangqian, Gao Yihan, and Zhang Zhongdao. Zhai Yifu, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Education, and Ma Xiaobo, Section Chief, attended as observers. The meeting was chaired by Vice Minister Hang. It was decided that the school would be temporarily located at the old site of Anhui University in Anqing. The permanent site would be decided at the second meeting. The school will temporarily offer programs in the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Law, Science, and Agriculture. The College of Liberal Arts will have five departments: Chinese, Western Languages, Economics, Politics, and Law. The College of Science will have four departments: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The College of Agriculture will have two departments: Agriculture and Forestry, and one specialty program in Tea. The Colleges of Science and Agriculture will start with the first-year classes, while all grades in the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Law will be offered simultaneously. The start-up funding has been approved at 500 million yuan. The school will begin operating after the summer vacation this year.</p>
<p>Elementary School Textbooks</p>
<p>For the textbooks needed for this semester in the province's elementary schools, I personally went to Shanghai before the start of school to purchase one million copies from the United Publishing Company and distributed them to the counties. Subsequently, supervisors were dispatched to the counties to urge them to raise funds and remit them directly to the company so that the books could be delivered in time. During this trip to Shanghai, I inquired about the purchase and delivery situation. The funds have been remitted to the United Publishing Company, and the books have been delivered, or the counties have directly sent people to pick up the books with the funds. The counties included Huaining, Qianshan, Taihu, Xuancheng, Nanling, Dangtu, Fanchang, Ningguo, Chaoxian, Wangjiang, Lingbi, Lai'an, Taihe, Fuyang, Huaiyuan, and Shouxian. The textbooks were already being sold in Shanghai at twenty-four times the original price, but the textbooks ordered by this department on behalf of the counties were still sold at fifteen times the original price. Many counties failed to remit funds and pick up the books on time, resulting in the expiration of the contracts. As a result, some counties had to purchase elementary school textbooks from bookstores at more than forty times the original price and distribute them to students, such as in Huoqiu County, which increased the burden on students. It is a great pity.</p>

<p>[Report by This Newspaper] The Shanghai Art Association held a reception at the Kangye Restaurant yesterday. More than thirty reporters and artists from various newspapers attended. Chu Wen, a specialist from the Central Cultural Movement Committee, presided over the meeting. Artists Ma Gongyu and Zhang Chongren reported the following: (1) The Shanghai art community will hold its first large-scale exhibition in ten years. It will collect the most outstanding works from the city's art community. It is scheduled to be held simultaneously at three locations from May 31 to June 6: the Chinese Painting Academy on Chengdu Road, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road, and Aurora University on Luba Road (still under negotiation). The works will be divided into nine categories: Chinese painting, Western painting, calligraphy, epigraphy, sculpture, cartoon, woodcut, photography, and design. Preference will be given to works related to the War of Resistance. (2) Regarding works from the War of Resistance period, the association has established a special "War of Resistance Art Group" to collect them, with Lang Jingshan, Zhang Chongren, Liu Shi, and Hong Bei as the responsible committee members. (3) A "Fine Arts Hall" will be established to regularly display the art works of artists. In the future, in order to deepen the understanding of foreign people, the association will strengthen the self-introduction of Chinese art to major cities abroad and regularly exhibit Chinese art works to constantly interact with foreigners in order to introduce Chinese art to the world. They appealed to the press for assistance in order to attract public attention. [Seeing] and hearing these lawless and absurd situations, I am filled with resentment and feel compelled to speak out:</p>
<p>Support the President</p>
<p>(1) Northwestern University is the highest institution of higher learning in Northwest China. It has a long and glorious history. It is the successor to the Northwest Associated University (a combination of Peking University, Normal University, and Beiyang University). During the War of Resistance, it persevered through hardship. In recent years, under the careful management of President Liu, it has achieved its present foundation. It is on the verge of making even greater progress. Who would have thought that cunning individuals would have ulterior motives, causing the nine-ren effort to fall short by one basketful? For the sake of the alma mater and the future of education, the alumni are expressing their support for President Liu and appealing to the military and political authorities and people from all walks of life to quickly provide [protection] to these disruptive elements in their speech and actions.</p>
<p>Retain the Teachers</p>
<p>(2) It is heard that after the incident occurred, more than one hundred responsible persons and professors and lecturers of all departments of the alma mater jointly submitted their resignations to the president, expressing their willingness to stay or leave with the president. The alumni are concerned that the foundation of the alma mater will be shaken and, on behalf of thousands of graduates, are expressing their desire to retain all the teachers. (3) After the occurrence of the disruptive events on April 15, the truth of the student unrest orchestrated by these conspiratorial elements was revealed to all, and they were inspired to unite and organize the school protection group. The alumni are expressing their sincere respect and admiration to all the students of the school protection group and hope that they will resist any threats and persevere to the end, so that justice and truth will prevail. Our alma mater bears a great mission for higher education in Northwest China. This incident is only a manifestation of the conspiracy of a few thugs. Under the righteous attitude and actions of all our teachers and pure students, this kind of sabotage conspiracy will soon be crushed, and the glorious tradition of our alma mater can be maintained without difficulty. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will give ardent support and effective assistance to the claims of this association.</p>

<p>To Resolve Students' Enrollment Issues</p>
<p>And Teachers' Unsettled Salaries</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Linhai by This Newspaper] Last summer, the Ministry of Education ordered the relocation of the Medical and Pharmaceutical departments of National Yingshi University to Zhejiang Provincial Medical College in Linhai. Due to the different academic programs, the Medical College found it difficult to merge them. In order to prevent the students from losing their education, a special class was set up to accommodate them. The Ministry of Education was repeatedly contacted, requesting that the students' enrollment and public loan issues be resolved quickly. Almost a year has passed, but there has been no response from the Ministry of Education. Furthermore, the incoming teachers are finding it difficult to live due to the lack of salary and research funding. When the two departments held a general meeting on April 27, they decided to start a strike from the afternoon of that day and send two representatives to Nanjing to petition. They will resume classes after receiving a satisfactory response from the Ministry of Education. (Chi)</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Chenggu by This Newspaper] Due to the long-unresolved student unrest issue, which is affecting the future of the school, the Northwestern University Alumni Association recently organized a school protection group and issued a letter to people from all walks of life, stating: The student unrest at Northwestern University has been going on for more than a month, and there have been twists and turns in the meantime. The alumni were saddened that the peace of the alma mater had not lasted long before unrest broke out again. Recently, the situation has intensified. On April 15, dozens of thugs, falsely using the name of the Northwestern University Student Union, forcibly seized various school departments and coerced President Liu to leave the school.

<p>The Basketball Committee, recognizing that the city gymnasium's facilities are ideal in every aspect, but the cement floor not only makes players prone to injury, but also becomes damp and slippery in inclement weather, causing many exciting matches to be repeatedly postponed, which is a great pity. Now, the city's top Chinese and foreign basketball teams have expressed their willingness to have a wooden floor installed in the gymnasium, holding several matches, with all proceeds, after deducting expenses, going to the aforementioned project. The Basketball Committee passed this proposal at a meeting a few days ago, and decided to invite (1) China United, (2) Lianghua, (3) Western Youth, and (4) the American Military to participate in a round-robin tournament. In case of a tie in points, a tiebreaker will be held. It is expected that two matches will be played each day, and the tournament will conclude within a week. Once the floor is installed, the Roosevelt Cup and Teacher's Charity Tournament will be staged successively. The four participating teams are all top-tier teams in Shanghai.

<h3 id="e111">A Tour of Shanghai University <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Shixiong</p>
<p>On Jungong Road in Yangshupu, stand many magnificent buildings. That is Shanghai University, which was occupied by Japanese invaders for a long time before the victory. In mid-April of this year, Shanghai University moved back to its campus and resumed its operations as an institution of higher learning. Yesterday, the author went to the school. Large-scale repair work is being carried out vigorously. Thousands of male and female students are bustling around, showing their joy at returning home and returning to their alma mater.</p>
<p>Due to the complete occupation by the Japanese invaders in the past, Shanghai University only had the empty shell of the school buildings left. Furthermore, the doors and windows were incomplete, and the desks and chairs were looted. In addition, the buildings were badly damaged due to years of disrepair. This time, when it moved back to its campus, it remade hundreds of desks and more than a thousand chairs and stools. All the walls were repainted, and thousands of broken pieces of glass were installed one by one. The sanitation facilities were also newly arranged. This expenditure cost more than 200 million national currency in the current high prices.</p>
<p>Nearly one thousand students live on campus, half male and half female. Double-layer wooden beds are used in the dormitories. It is said that these wooden beds were bought from the American military authorities at a relatively low price. Some students, who were used to being pampered and spoiled, felt uncomfortable and inconvenient sleeping on the upper bunk. Therefore, Principal Ling Xuan said to the students: "After this war, the United States believes that double-layer beds can double the dormitory capacity, so major middle schools in the United States have also adopted double-layer beds. Moreover, although the scale of this school's relocation is rudimentary, the cost is very large. If the students living on campus share the cost, each person will have to pay more than 200,000 national currency. However, the school pays all the money, and the students living on campus do not have to bear a single penny. Therefore, the students should not express any dissatisfaction."</p>
<p>Principal Ling is a brilliant and outstanding talent. He is 41 years old and is the youngest university president. He was originally the general manager of the Central Printing Factory. This time, he took office as president, partly because his alma mater urged him to do so with difficulty, and partly because he has his own views. He said: "During the Anti-Japanese War, the supply of overseas banknotes was cut off. I was ordered to print banknotes and make raw materials such as paper and ink to meet the needs of wartime finance in the free zone. Now is the beginning of reconstruction and construction. What the country needs is not banknotes but talents. Therefore, I devote myself to education and do my best to cultivate talents." Although Principal Ling has experienced the officialdom, he has no official airs at all. Any student can visit and talk to him at any time. Especially for students from poor families, he will try to solve their difficulties so that they can study and work part-time with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the books in the library were rescued at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. Recently, they have been returned. There are a total of 450 boxes of books, many of which are precious and rare books. Many work-study students are carrying lists and busy sorting out the books. The school pays them 300 yuan per hour to subsidize part of their tuition and board expenses.</p>
<p>The auditorium is a three-story steel-framed brick and stone building with more than a thousand seats. It is magnificent and comparable to the Zhongshang Cinema. The hall was only completed two months before the war and was only used once. The construction cost at that time was 10,000 yuan, which cannot be built for tens of millions now. Among the school's buildings, this is the only place that is unharmed and as good as ever.</p>
<p>Inside Shanghai University, there are also banking and post office settings. The bank is specifically operated by the Xinhua Trust and Savings Bank. The post office is staffed by school employees. There are nearly a thousand mailboxes in the office, covered with glass. After class, students can go to the post office to check their mailboxes for mail at a glance. This facility is modeled after a modern European and American school and is more advanced than before the war. The school has also rushed to install telephones, with a total of four lines, all belonging to the Zhabei Transportation Department Telecommunications Bureau.</p>
<p>In the past, there were many trees and flowers in the school, with lush greenery and fragrant flowers. It was indeed a paradise in eastern Shanghai. However, in the past few years, the Japanese invaders cut down the trees, burned the flowers, and left a desolate scene that was shocking! It is said that some Western professors were saddened and even shed tears when they thought of these lovely trees and flowers. This is a sign of Shanghai University's overwhelming changes.</p>
<p>It takes half an hour to walk from the tram stop at the bottom of Yangshupu to Shanghai University on Jungong Road. At present, there is a deep lack of transportation. The school has a car and two truck that shuttle between the Shaughai University downtown business school campus at 209 Yuanmingyuan Road and the Jungong Road campus to transport faculty, staff and students.</p>
<p>According to Principal Ling, "At the end of August last year, when the Japanese invaders surrendered, I was ordered to fly to Shanghai. In Zhijiang, I received an order from Commander-in-Chief He to take over this school immediately. After several months of efforts, I overcame various difficulties and finally completed the initial stage. However, future development requires the greatest effort, because Shanghai University's losses are more than 100 million national currency. At present, only a part has been done. In addition to asking the American church for subsidies, I hope that the alumni association will donate more." Principal Ling, who is eagerly looking forward to the future with optimism, is now striding forward on the road to Shanghai University's restoration.</p>

<h3 id="e112">The Market is Full of Bullish Sentiment: Government Bonds Advance Steadily, Capital from the Temporary Capital Flows to this Port, and Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Rise Across the Board <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The government bond industry is still mostly assisting buying. It is speculated that a senior figure in the textile industry has absorbed some bonds. There is a rumor that the wartime overdue funds owed to the Central Bank of China must be repaid with government bonds, which has boosted buying interest considerably. Tong Bing initially opened at a low point, and under the encouragement of positive factors such as large investors buying and easing credit, it gradually rose from 6,500 yuan to close at 71,000 yuan, an increase of 10% compared to the previous close. Jia, Yi, and Wu also rose by about 10%. Ding, however, was the weakest, rising by only 300 yuan. Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw a return of floating funds. The pessimistic sentiment of the past few days has eased slightly, and all stocks showed signs of recovery. Popular stocks led the way from the opening, and buyers from the temporary capital seemed fearless. Around noon, all stocks were profitable, and the closing price was slightly flat. Hot stocks rose by a little less than 10% compared to the previous close, while less popular stocks rose by about 5%. Cold stocks were still difficult to catch up. In the afternoon, the bidding continued to flourish. Foreign stocks opened an hour later than Chinese stocks. At this time, the credit was loosened due to the arrival of remittances. Banks from the Sichuan gang were still willing to absorb funds. Initially, Yisha stock jumped up by 10%, but the rebound was too strong, causing some people to sell at high prices, and the price retreated from 14,700 yuan to 14,200 yuan. However, the environment changed quickly, and security firms and Western merchants pursued the stock, and the price returned to above 15,000 yuan at noon. As a result, the popular Yisha and British Alliance stocks rose by 12% compared to the previous close. Asia, buoyed by the residual funds from security firms, also rose by 10%. The remaining stocks rose by only about 5% due to weaker appeal.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was again mediocre, as sales were sluggish and market sentiment turned dull. However, raw material cotton prices did not ease, so manufacturers were temporarily unwilling to sell at low prices. 10-count yarn was only a small 5,000 to 10,000 [yuan], 42-count yarn remained stable because the Han gang and weaving factories were buying, as its price was similar to the price of 32-count double-strand yarn.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton telegraphic quotes fell 7 to 20 points per pound. The near-term price was US$27.39, the forward price was US$27.55, and the spot price of middling cotton was US$28.04. The local cotton market was firm, but trading decreased significantly, with only Shenxin Second Factory and Jiafeng factories making some transactions.</p>

<p>The money market turned stable yesterday. The Central Bank of China's allocated price did not change, and no one registered. At the opening of the morning, it hovered around 1.6 million. After the opening, buying interest subsided, and it fell slightly to 1.58 million after 10 o'clock. Therefore, no one in the industry asked the Central Bank of China to collect allocated goods. The credit situation was dull. At noon, it rose slightly back to around 1.6 million. In the afternoon, it once rose slightly, first hovering at 1.61 million, and finally struggling at the allocated price. As a result, it rose by 20,000 compared to the previous close.

At noon, it rose back to 2,200 yuan with the rise in gold prices. In the afternoon, it remained extremely stable. Hedging on gold was around 720 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly by 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were affected by the fall in the Hong Kong exchange rate, and overseas remittances were more abundant. Although it once rebounded at noon, it was difficult to last, and as a result, it fell by another 5 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate fell from 430 yuan to below 420 yuan. The rupee was around 520 yuan, and the US exchange rate remained flat. The fixed bank's dealing price was also flat.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the opening price of artificial silk 120-count Daqiao was 1.32 million yuan, which was quite weak. Later, there were buyers, and the price gradually increased, and the closing price seemed to be 1.39 million yuan. In the afternoon, the price of the original product from the previous day was quoted. The 120-count miscellaneous brand was short by another 20,000 yuan. The 120-count semi-gloss was rarely asked about, and the price was lower for that reason. The factory's foreign goods still did not start to be made. Customers from Hangzhou purchased ordinary silk slightly better. There were more than ten loads of transactions yesterday. Five loads of dry silk were transacted at a price of 1.36 million yuan, with a ten-day term bill. The price of the American Asian quilt cover fell by another 30,000 to 40,000 yuan yesterday.

<p>The new Longjing tea from Wenzhou has been on the market for more than a month. Although there are still arrivals these days, the quality is old and inferior, so the market price is gradually declining. In addition to the mutual scramble for Jin gang and Suxi, the shops in this street are also busy with handling, so the market is stable. As for Zhulan tea, in the sound of depleted inventory, there are many more people who like it, and there are more monks than porridge.</p>

Retail prices of pork ribs and lean meat have also risen to a high price of 1,800 yuan per kilogram, and leg meat is 1,500 to 1,600 yuan. Only spareribs are cheap, at 1,300 to 1,400 yuan per kilogram. Pork lard is also sold at 1,000 yuan per kilogram, but it has just fallen slightly yesterday.

<p>The sugar market is difficult to revive, and customers and shops on this street are sluggish. In addition, credit is still tight, and the Changju must also collect business tax, and the profits are even thinner, so the industry is mostly adopting a wait-and-see approach. The association opened 1,600 bags of white honey yesterday (63,000 yuan) and sold 660 bags. 1,800 bags of raw sand (52,000 yuan) and sold 180 bags. Medium sand was priced between 57,000 yuan and 58,500 yuan, and transactions were made.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, July 7] Imports of Japanese, Chinese, and Italian silk goods into the United States may not be able to save the hosiery industry from its panic, as competition from other silk consumers is fierce, and many of the imported silks are not suitable for making silk quilts. Before the war, the US hosiery industry used 290,000 bales of natural silk annually, while this year only 50,000 bales of silk are imported from Japan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the timber market remained sluggish. It is reported that over 20,000 feet of camphorwood arrived from Taiwan, priced at approximately 1,500 yuan per foot. Taiwan is abundant in forests, and various types of timber are expected to arrive in Shanghai continuously.</p>
<p>Southern Anhui fir timber markets are mostly concentrated in areas around Tunxi and Xiuning. Due to heavy rains and rising water levels this spring, timber merchants have been purchasing and transporting timber. Rafts of timber on the Xin'an River are incessantly traveling downstream. The price at the mountain source is reported to be 50,000 yuan per "liang," and the price in Hangzhou is over 80,000 yuan per "liang." According to industry insiders, the amount of fir timber transported to Hangzhou by summer is estimated to exceed 5,000 "liang." At that time, the price of fir timber in this city is expected to stabilize. Still at $3.30 USD, Tianjin packing specifications are 43 boxes, 55 boxes, or 66 boxes (each box weighing 110 pounds). The New York market price once rose to $5.50 per pound due to shortages. Recently, with more goods arriving, the price has slightly decreased, currently ranging from $4.50 to $5.00. Based on current domestic values, the sale of Chongqing and Tianjin hog bristles in the US barely covers costs.</p>
<p>Regarding rumors that nylon will compete for the Chinese hog bristle market in the US, according to those familiar with the international hog bristle situation, while nylon production is significant, its quality is very poor, with many lengths not meeting standards, and its hardness is weak. In the US, it is mostly used for household brushes, while industrial brushes still use Chinese bristles. It is also stated that the Chinese hog bristle market in the US will not be overwhelmed by nylon.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Large Quantity of Wool from UNRRA to be Used for Textile Construction Materials, Suffering of Private Wool Textile Industry <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The private wool textile industry in Shanghai had a considerable foundation before the war. After the victory, it faced difficulties due to a lack of raw materials, labor unrest, and the impending large-scale import of foreign goods, making it difficult to sustain itself. It is reported that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) shipped over 1.1 million pounds of wool, which was entirely allocated to the wool spinning department of the state-owned China Textile Construction Corporation. Private factories were unable to share any of it. Yesterday, this newspaper reported that the Japanese wool textile industry currently has 480,000 spindles and has applied to the Allied Supreme Commander for permission to import 350,000 bales of wool, intending to export finished cloth abroad. The industry cannot remain indifferent and intends to request that UNRRA distribute the wool equally to promote widespread access and maintain operations.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Santiago, Brazil, 7th] In the 1945-46 season, Chile's rice production is expected to reach a record high of 110,000 metric tons. The total area planted with rice in 1945-46 is 51,335 hectares (one hectare equals 2.471 acres), compared to 44,316 hectares in the previous harvest. According to informal reports, domestic consumption in 1946 is estimated at 45,000 to 50,000 metric tons of white rice, leaving 60,000 metric tons available for export.

<h3 id="e128">Britain Stabilizes Cotton Market, Continues to Implement Control, Liverpool Market Remains Closed <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>[British Information Services, London, 7th] Mr. Mackinder, Minister of Overseas Trade in the United Kingdom, recently explained the British government's decision to close the Liverpool Cotton Market and continue collective cotton purchasing in a speech to the United Textile Factory Workers' Association. He stated that the British government has given prolonged and careful consideration to the collective bulk purchase of cotton and has no intention of changing this decision, which is in the best interest of the cotton industry. The Liverpool Cotton Market, comprising 200 commercial companies, developed in the 19th century and was indeed a medium for trade and a supplier of market information. However, the situation has now changed. Before 1941, many people in the textile industry no longer relied on brokers and established their own purchasing offices. The Liverpool Cotton Market had already become an anachronism before the government closed it. Mr. Mackinder further emphasized that the trend towards rational disposal of cotton in the post-war world is becoming increasingly evident. Wartime experience has shown that the control of the cotton industry has been a great success, ensuring a large supply of cotton and a large amount of storage. The government's Cotton Control Department has set price limits for 21 different types of cotton. Opponents of the closure of the Liverpool Cotton Market argue that this may prompt a European country to establish such a market. However, according to Mr. Mackinder, this is impossible. Mr. Mackinder acknowledged that the closure of the Liverpool market may result in a slight loss in foreign exchange, but the government believes that the stability of cotton prices and the normalcy of supply provide a good foundation for expanding cotton export trade. From a monetary point of view, this more than compensates for the small foreign exchange loss. The Cotton Control Department currently manages cotton worth 50 million pounds annually with a staff of 80 people. Once this is taken over by the Purchasing Committee, the number of staff will increase. The members of the committee will be composed of relevant parties from all sides. Price stability and the economics of bulk purchasing will be a significant gain for the industry.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Textile Construction's Sale of Cloth Not Widespread, Sparks Strike Among Cloth Merchants, Protest from Three Guilds Regarding Seized Cloth to be Sold <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The China Textile Construction Corporation has recently been expanding its sales efforts. In addition to establishing branch offices in other cities, it has also signed agreements with large cotton cloth stores in this city, such as Shi Da Xiang, Xie Da Xiang, and Xin Da Xiang, to establish sales agencies. Yesterday, when Textile Construction opened its goods for sale, it was criticized by cotton cloth merchants, and they prevented the listing of prices, causing a dispute. The cotton cloth guild's market and its related Leyuan Market went on strike in response. In the afternoon, several thousand cotton cloth merchants criticized the guild's board of directors, demanding that the three large stores be prevented from operating sales agencies and that members be notified to postpone opening their goods for sale. The guild's board of directors accepted this request and advised the three large stores to stop operating the sales agencies and notified members to postpone opening their goods for sale to avoid disputes. It is also reported that the goods that Textile Construction plans to sell are goods that were taken over from the Pseudo-Cotton Control Association. Therefore, the three guilds of dyeing, weaving, and yarn cloth have also issued a declaration, which is excerpted below.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the case of our guild's request for the return of the remaining amount of yarn and cloth forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppets has undergone repeated changes in recent months. The handling authorities have repeatedly changed and contradicted their approvals. Initially, it was determined that the purchase of yarn and cloth was indeed carried out by the enemy and puppets through coercion, which was in line with the handling measures, and it was approved for return. Yongxin, Yongchang, and other companies were approved for return in succession. Subsequently, the review committee overturned the approved cases on the grounds that there was no way to verify them. After our guild argued on the basis of reason, the bureau made the excuse that the merchants had already received bidding money at that time and had not suffered much loss, and refused to return the goods. Such a blind and arbitrary decision could not make the victims feel willing to accept it. The National Political Council recently held a meeting in Chongqing, upholding justice for this case, and decided to hand it over to the government for thorough investigation and return. The National Federation of Commerce, which is currently holding a meeting in Nanjing, will also submit a proposal suggesting that the government handle the matter fairly. Our guild has also filed an appeal with the Executive Yuan, seeking a reasonable solution. The highest authorities are seriously considering and making a decision on this matter. Recently, it was reported that the Enemy Property Administration has decided to treat the remaining yarn and cloth as government materials and hand them over to the Textile Construction Corporation for auction. Such impatience is truly regrettable. However, our fellow traders should have a deep understanding and firm confidence in this matter, wait patiently for a solution, and not be blinded by immediate gains, so as not to harm the interests of the entire industry. This is what we hope for.</p>

<h3 id="e130">An Indelible Impression: The People of Wuhan Welcome Chairman Chiang <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhou Yaying, Hankou, This Newspaper Air Report, 3rd</p>
<p>In the season of gentle rain, when people rejoice in the rain, Wuhan, eight months after its recovery, received long-awaited good news: "Chairman Chiang will fly to Wuhan today on his way to Nanjing!" This is as if "great peace is hoped for," and once abundant rain is received, it heals the sick and gladdens the worried, with everyone expressing joyous emotions.</p>
<p>From October 24, 1938, the eve of our army's retreat from Wuhan, it had been more than seven years since Chairman Chiang had left Wuhan. During these long years, the misfortunes encountered by the people of Wuhan were naturally unbearable to recall, because everything needed to be rebuilt and construction was difficult. The scars inflicted upon us by the enemy were still vividly visible! Even the bumpy and uneven major roads were only filled in by the head of the Wuhan Municipal Works Bureau under nighttime supervision just before Chairman Chiang's arrival in Wuhan.</p>
<p>However, material destruction did not hinder spiritual growth. Today, the national territory has been restored, and the government is triumphantly returning to the capital amidst songs of victory. People look forward to a bright future of peace and construction from Chairman Chiang's wisdom and diligence, and they have not forgotten the injuries they suffered in the past, receiving infinite comfort in their hearts. From this inner comfort, they expressed sincere and enthusiastic encouragement and gratitude.</p>
<p>Before Chairman Chiang's arrival in Wuhan, the local authorities did not announce the exact time of his arrival. Therefore, from 10:00 AM, party, government, and military officials and representatives from all walks of life went to the airport to wait in the rain. In particular, we reporters who were assigned to cover the event, although we did not receive admission passes, spared no effort to follow the officials into the airport.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Bathed in Timely Rain, Feeling Especially Warm and Moist <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Around 4:00 PM, the welcoming party had gathered at the airport, arranged in three rows. Unfortunately, the rain became heavier and heavier. Apart from a few ladies carrying small patterned umbrellas just enough to cover themselves, most of the welcoming party stood upright in good order, even though their clothes were soaked by raindrops. Everyone had a kind expression on their faces, as if they felt especially warm and moist being bathed in this rain. Particularly commendable was General Chennault, who had just flown in from Nanjing, who also braved fatigue to wait with us. In addition to briefly discussing the mission of the Air Transport Corps, he earnestly said to the reporters: "I have known Chairman Chiang for several years, and he is indeed a giant of your nation!"</p>
<h3 id="e132">Rain Stops, Wind Ceases, Special Plane Slowly Descends <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>After waiting at the airport for an hour, the rain soon stopped and the wind ceased. A plane carrying Chairman Chiang's entourage slowly descended from the clouds. Then, the majestic "Meiling" plane also landed. Led by a command car, it drove towards our line. Everyone stood up automatically, with nervous and happy hearts. The air at the airport was particularly quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e133">"You Are Tired": Chairman Expresses Gratitude <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>After the Chairman alighted from the plane, Director Qian first paid his respects to the Chairman on behalf of everyone. Three young ladies from the municipal girls' middle school presented flowers to the Chairman and his wife. The Chairman nodded frequently to express his gratitude. Subsequently, amid the melodious military music, the Chairman, accompanied by his wife, reviewed the honor guard and the welcoming line, smiling and answering questions while saying kindly to everyone:</p>
<p>"Okay, you are tired, thank you!"</p>
<h3 id="e134">Driving to the Residence, Cars Trailing Like a Ribbon <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>After a short pause, the Chairman and his wife boarded a car and drove to the Yihua Village residence. More than 100 cars followed behind, trailing like a ribbon. Along the way, citizens, young and old, came out to welcome them, vying to catch a glimpse of the Chairman's demeanor. As the Chairman's car passed by, the crowd applauded and cheered, the sound shaking the roofs. The Chairman waved his hat in response, longing for the citizens of Wuhan with boundless affection! Everyone respectfully listened to his "voice" and saw that the Chairman was still full of energy and graceful in manner, which could not help but increase the bright hope and confidence in the future of national construction.</p>
<p>"Extra! An extra about Chairman Chiang's arrival in Hankou!" Many citizens who did not have time to see the Chairman's demeanor competed to purchase the newspapers at the call of the newsboys.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Tense Market Slightly Reveals an Atmosphere of Calm <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Most gratifyingly, the tense and chaotic market in recent days also revealed a slightly warmer atmosphere. That afternoon, gold fell again, with the price falling from 175,000 yuan per tael to 165,000 yuan per tael. Other foreign yarns, department stores, oil, salt, firewood, and rice not only dared not rise, but immediately showed a steady posture. Originally, price fluctuations were mostly due to the actions of unscrupulous merchants, probably because they were intimidated by the Chairman's virtue and could not help but slightly restrain their ferocity.</p>

<p>But has the work of Wuhan's recovery made expected progress? How are the lives of the compatriots in the disaster areas and the suffering of the general public? These were the questions of greatest concern to Chairman Chiang. Therefore, after Chairman Chiang entered the official residence, he gathered the party, government, and military leaders here in a tea party to ask detailed questions about the local situation. In order to understand the actual situation of the people, he also inspected the urban area for a week that evening at 8:00 PM.</p>

<p>At the same time that the Chairman was inquiring about the leaders, Mrs. Chiang also received the women's representatives here, Ms. Guo Silin (Mrs. Guo Chan) and Xie Yongying, who had the nickname "Female Soldier." She instructed on the direction of the women's movement in the future, urging women leaders to carry out literacy and production movements, and to establish nurseries and strengthen childcare work. She believed that today's women's movement is not just a question of whether or not to participate in politics, but how to enable the vast majority of women to fulfill the obligations of a modern citizen.</p>

<p>Time was too pressing, because Mr. Hoover was waiting in Nanjing to be received, and the hard-working Chairman Chiang returned to the capital early this morning. Apart from the time for rest, he only stayed in Wuhan for five hours. Therefore, some organizations and groups did not have time to express their respect for the Chairman, some citizens did not have time to appeal for justice, and in particular, the senators who were reviewing provincial affairs had many difficult problems that they did not have the opportunity to ask for instructions immediately, and they all felt that it was an uncompensated gap in their hearts.</p>
<p>However, precisely because everyone had this feeling of remembrance and regret, Chairman Chiang's arrival in Wuhan not only gave the people of the three towns an indelible impression, but also gave the administrative staff at all levels a new inspiration. This inspiration will nurture new buds and bear great fruits.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Director of the Zhujiang District Navigation Administration, Zhou Yanming, Bribery Case: Attempted Bribery of the Liangguang Inspector-General with 500,000 Yuan <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Guangzhou Navigation Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 28th, Special Correspondent Liang Feng Reports</p>
<p>In this dry and sultry weather, there are truly too many things that cause anxiety! For example, the price of rice has risen to over 60,000 yuan per dan, and epidemics are prevalent, causing everyone to frown and display uneasy emotions. However, in this depressing atmosphere, there is one piece of news that brings joy: Zhou Yanming, the former Director of the Zhujiang District Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Communications, who was previously accused of corruption and dereliction of duty, recently attempted to bribe Liangguang Inspector-General Liu Houwu with 500,000 yuan. Inspector-General Liu filed an impeachment and sent a letter to the Guangzhou District Court Prosecutor's Office to detain the Director.</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Speaking of the background of this Director Zhou, it is quite extraordinary. He joined the Tongmenghui, served as the Director of the Transportation Department of the General Headquarters, and when Chen Jiongming governed Guangdong, he served as the Commander of Protecting the Sandbanks, and later held important positions in the Ministry of Communications. During the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the Director of the Zhujiang Navigation Administration in Wuzhou and the Director of the Xijiang Navigation Service Agency. At that time, the malpractices and poor performance during his tenure were already widely criticized. After the restoration, the Navigation Administration was renamed the Guangzhou Navigation Administration, and Zhou continued to serve as Director. Because the navigation industry was at its peak at that time, Zhou relied on his power to extort merchants, taking advantage of the opportunity to issue so-called "Navigation Permits" to demand money, amounting to hundreds of thousands of yuan. After the bureau was restored in Guangzhou and renamed the Zhujiang District Navigation Administration, Zhou used his authority to engage in illegal acts and dereliction of duty, again causing public criticism. People filed more than five complaints with the Liangguang Inspector-General's Office, accusing him of corruption. On February 16th of this year, Zhu Kedong and others, preparatory members of the Guangzhou Navigation Association's Preparatory Committee, jointly reported Zhou's crimes of corruption, extortion, and harboring traitors. The Seamen's Union also complained that the bureau charged 10,000 yuan for each worker to obtain a handbook for seamen's registration, which cost only several hundred yuan, and even more was extorted from the chief mate and second mate, which was undoubtedly extortion. At the same time, the Salt Industry Association also filed numerous complaints about the bureau's arbitrary imposition of taxes and extortion. Therefore, the Liangguang Inspector-General's Office, having received these numerous complaints, could not but begin a secret investigation into these cases.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>While the investigation was underway, Director Zhou, feeling guilty, thought that he had to "smooth things over." On February 23rd, he personally went to Inspector-General Liu's residence to inquire about the investigation and expressed his desire for leniency. At that time, Inspector-General Liu said: "The investigation of this office is divided into two categories: specialized investigation and general investigation. This general investigation is not specifically aimed at the Navigation Bureau. If there are no malpractices, you can rest assured. Otherwise, since personnel from the court and the audit office are also present, they can also report on their own. Even if I wanted to show leniency, I am powerless to help." Seeing that Inspector-General Liu said this, Zhou naturally did not dare to ask for further favors.</p>
<p>Two days after Zhou left, Director Zhou's wife, Chen Juefei, went to Liu's residence, saying that she was looking for Mrs. Liu. As it happened, Mrs. Liu had just gone out to get her hair done, so she sat there and waited until Mrs. Liu returned. It was lunchtime, so Mrs. Liu invited her to dine together. After the meal, Mrs. Zhou said goodbye, and Mrs. Liu saw her to the door. She then took out a large paper package, saying that it was a small gift for the Inspector-General to buy tonics. Mrs. Liu immediately declined and turned upstairs. She then handed the paper package to the orderly at Liu's residence and left by car. The orderly handed the paper package to Inspector-General Liu, who opened it and found that it contained 500,000 yuan in legal tender. Inspector-General Liu asked Mrs. Liu to return the money. Later, Mrs. Liu found out Zhou's address and personally returned the money. However, Mrs. Zhou insisted on accompanying Mrs. Liu back to her residence, but got off the car halfway, wanting to buy gifts. Mrs. Liu again declined. At that time, Mrs. Zhou took out the money again, insisting that Mrs. Liu accept it. Because of the back-and-forth refusal on the road, fearing that it would attract attention, Mrs. Zhou again handed the money to the orderly accompanying Mrs. Liu. Inspector-General Liu, knowing this situation, felt that it was inappropriate to be lenient any further. Therefore, he first handed the money over to the cashier for deposit and then went to the High Court to discuss the matter with President Shi and Chief Prosecutor Zhang. This was originally in February, but why is it only being revealed now? The reason is that Inspector-General Liu believed that the various cases against Director Zhou had not yet been fully investigated. If the bribery was immediately brought to light, the court would definitely detain him according to law, which would affect the progress of the investigations.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>More than a month passed, and perhaps Director Zhou thought that he could get away with it. Unexpectedly, after dusk on April 11th, the court prosecutor's office sent three prosecutors, including Prosecutor Wang Shulong, along with six bailiffs and four military police, to Zhou's residence to arrest Zhou Binming. However, it was found that Zhou had gone dancing and had not returned after a long wait. At seven o'clock the next morning, the entire team went to the Navigation Administration again, but Zhou had not yet returned to the bureau. Prosecutor Wang saw that the situation was urgent and feared that something might happen if he delayed, so he immediately returned to Zhou's residence. It was already 9:30, and the gate was still tightly locked, and the people inside seemed to be still asleep. Prosecutor Wang first led the military police to set an ambush around the area, and Prosecutor Xie Yaoxin knocked on the door and entered. At that time, Mrs. Zhou appeared, realizing that something was wrong, and claimed that Zhou was not at home. Unexpectedly, the telephone rang loudly, and it was Director Chen of the Navigation Administration calling, wanting to complain that the court had sent people to look for him. Prosecutor Xie immediately determined that Zhou must be in the house and immediately ordered a search. Mrs. Zhou refused to be searched, and they argued with each other. It turned out that the Director was indeed sleeping soundly in the room, awakened by the noise. At that time, he was still wearing his pajamas and asked what was going on. When Prosecutor Xie took out the secret orders from Inspector-General Liu and the court prosecutor's office, Zhou could not help but change color on the spot, lowered his head and said nothing, only put on his coat and left with Prosecutor Xie.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>After Zhou was arrested, the court questioned Zhou once about the bribery, and Zhou vehemently denied that it had happened. The court also summoned Zhou's wife, and Zhou's wife cunningly argued that the 500,000 yuan in national currency given to Inspector-General Liu was not a bribe, but simply given to him for medical expenses because Inspector-General Liu was ill at the time. When reporters saw Zhou at the court that day, his short, fat body was wearing a gray flannel suit, with gold-rimmed glasses on his nose. Although his face was flushed, he could not hide his anxiety. His fat feet were already shackled. This dignified Director has now been imprisoned, probably with the feeling of "If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have done it in the first place!"</p>
<p>After this incident, the public paid close attention, because among the corrupt officials punished in Guangdong province, Director Zhou was considered to be in a relatively high position! At the same time, Zhou was a National Assembly representative. The National Assembly representatives of this province held a meeting to discuss Zhou's "public rights" and sent Qiu Zhaowen and three other representatives to visit the Chief Prosecutor of the court, requesting that Zhou's case be concluded before the National Assembly or that he be temporarily released on bail to participate in the election and then be dealt with. However, the court believed that Zhou had violated the expectations of the people and was accused of five counts of corruption, so it was not convenient to reply immediately to the request for postponement of the trial!</p>
<p>Now, the investigation into Zhou's bribery has been completed, and the public trial is scheduled for April 27th. In today's deteriorating world, eradicating corruption and purifying officialdom is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country, so this time Zhou's impeachment can also be considered news that pleases the people.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Beautifying Wuhu City, Creating a Green Pattern: Anhui Provincial Government Establishes a Municipal Preparatory Office, Wuhu Communication on the 2nd, Zhu Minwei <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu City, famous for its rice production, is currently undergoing a transformation. The population has increased from 180,000 before the war to 270,000, but the number of houses seems to be less than before the war, because the damaged houses have not yet been repaired.</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government has established a Municipal Preparatory Office in Wuhu, with Zhang Xiadui, the Administrative Inspector of the Second District, concurrently serving as the Director. Mr. Zhang chatted with reporters about municipal administration for an hour on a gray sofa chair in the dim office of the old municipal preparatory office. From November 1945, when Mr. Zhang arrived in Wuhu, to the end of April, he did the following things:</p>
<p>(1) Repaired a ring road around the pond, providing a wide road around Tao Pond for citizens to take morning walks and enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>(2) Repaired and leveled the larger roads and sidewalks on both sides of Wuhu, and planted 6,000 new white poplars, willows, and plane trees along the edges of the sidewalks. He hopes that these 6,000 saplings will provide shade in ten years, creating a beautiful green pattern in Wuhu.</p>
<p>(3) Repaired and expanded the public sports field and rebuilt a command platform inside the field for parades and public gatherings.</p>
<p>(4) Built a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall near the Yongdian Factory to enhance the cultural atmosphere of Wuhu.</p>
<p>(5) Ordered each of the thirteen township offices to build a public toilet that meets modern urban standards.</p>
<p>(6) The Yihou Relief Branch provided funds to build the "Foreign Bridge" over the Chang River, connecting the northern urban area with the southern rice market. To connect the bridge with the road, the bridge site was moved from the original Ningyang Temple to near the Yingjiang Temple.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang, the Wuhu Police Bureau is now under the jurisdiction and command of the Municipal Preparatory Office, and the Municipal Hospital has also been transferred from the province to him. He is also planning to establish a large library.</p>
<p>In terms of municipal appearance, what Mr. Zhang has done is very appropriate. Wuhu will definitely be beautified like Mr. Zhang's hometown of Guilin. This is what the people of Wuhu are unanimously looking forward to.</p>
<p>However, according to the people of Wuhu, if the focus of municipal administration is not placed on "people's livelihood," it is easy to become a "flower vase" type of decoration. In this era of restoring production, maintaining transportation, and developing commerce, municipal administration needs to be closely linked to the overall national policy. This issue naturally goes beyond the scope and ability of a Municipal Preparatory Office. In the face of food shortages and rising rice prices, Wuhu's municipal administration should also implement effective countermeasures aimed at the increasingly serious "people's livelihood" problems.

<h3 id="e141">The Depression of Civil Servants in Taiwan, Special Correspondent Mu Yun, Newspaper Navigation on the 28th <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>All civil servants in Taiwan are now struggling with starvation. Those who came from the mainland received settlement allowances and travel expenses, forcing them to "settle down once they arrive," but now even "settling down" has become a problem. Because salaries cannot be adjusted, a delegated official's salary is at most 2,000 yuan, which is only enough for the most basic personal food expenses. The settlement allowances transferred by the government office, sent out last November, have still not been received by many people, and those transferred to the Shanghai office of the Bank of Taiwan in March are still held up, supposedly due to procedural issues. Therefore, they cannot support themselves or their families, and what is reflected in their work is only laxity, perfunctoriness, inertia, and indifference. The salaries of the local Taiwanese are generally lower, so they are already dissatisfied, and during the office hours from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day, there is nothing to do, which is extremely boring, and those who live farther away cannot return home in time. They say that the Japanese summer office hours were reasonable, so there is a general lack of responsibility and perfunctoriness.</p>
<p>Two Bureau Chiefs Committed Suicide</p>
<p>Two months ago, a bureau chief in Chiayi committed suicide, and recently, the police chief in Kaohsiung committed suicide. They both suffered from the same problem: anemia and no money. The "China Daily" editorial, "Settle the Hearts of Civil Servants," said, "I believe that most civil servants can be searched and found to have dunning letters from their families." The conclusion is: "To reform politics in this province, we must first find a way to settle their hearts!" A recommended official said to the trustee: "I am not as good as a barber, who can earn 6,000 yuan per month!" The government office has decided to improve the remittance method starting in May, and remittances can be made by draft or transfer, but only to Shanghai and Fujian. Regulations have also been established for bringing family members: for direct relatives up to four people, each person will receive 5,000 yuan in travel expenses. As for salaries, they will also be adjusted starting in May.</p>
<p>Freedom of Speech Will Never Be Crushed</p>
<p>In his speech at the first press conference after the restoration, Chief Chen said: "I will never crush the press, and I will absolutely grant freedom of speech." The concluding sentence was, "China is a whole and does not tolerate deformity!" It is rumored in financial circles here that the authorities will soon issue new currency to replace the Taiwan dollar, which will be used within the jurisdiction of this province, and a new look will soon appear in this economic vacuum!</p>
<p>Democracy of the Taiwanese</p>
<p>The Taiwanese now all talk about "democracy" and use "democracy" as a catchphrase. When the government executes official duties and encounters resistance from them, they answer that this is "democracy," and "democracy" has become a self-serving shield.</p>
<p>After the election of the Provincial Assembly, a certain powerful association openly opposed it: "Democracy that is not democratic."</p>
<p>The atrocities of the vagrants are actions taken under the guise of "democracy," and open opposition is the response of "democracy." The greatest crisis of democracy lies in those who distort "democracy!".</p>

<p>When I arrived in Nanjing, night had just fallen. Looking back at the riverside of Xiaguan, it seemed that the night tide was surging. The ship that brought us also gradually disappeared into the vastness. The car entered the city, passed through Yijiang Gate, and sped along the smooth road. The night wind hit my face, a little chilly. Looking at the scattered lights in the city, they seemed to be welcoming eyes.</p>
<p>Eight years! After being separated from this famous city of the Six Dynasties, the mountains and rivers that were always in my dreams are now spread out before my eyes again. The mountains and rivers are unharmed. This time, I am truly relieved and attached to them. Time is constantly washing away, and many things have changed, but the Stone City still maintains its original appearance, making people remember something, but it is immediately covered by a kind of excitement of returning from a long journey. Late at night, leaning on the pillow, I listened to the peddlers selling late-night snacks in the alley, tapping small bamboo clappers as they passed by. I was moved by this familiar Jiangnan mood and pondered silently.</p>

<p>From any perspective, Nanjing is now moving from desolation to prosperity. After the victory, it was once desolate, with few pedestrians on the streets and many buildings sealed up. Now, the number of people coming from the mountains and the water is increasing day by day. Although the number of personnel returning to the capital every day is very limited due to transportation restrictions, it is gradually increasing. These people seem to be a new blood injected into every main road in Nanjing. Now Nanjing seems to be awakening from its slumber. Walking on the street, you can see a bustling crowd, most of whom are from Chongqing. With the dust of travel not yet settled on their shoulders, they are already walking on the wide streets, observing everything here with curious eyes. Many houses that were closed in the past are now open and have been repainted, giving them a new look.</p>
<p>Nanjing! You have become the political center, replacing Chongqing. The heads of various ministries have arrived one after another, and the staff of various agencies have already been working. General Marshall's arrival on April 30th further shows that Nanjing has become the focus of attention of people across the country in the future.</p>

<p>Since April 25th, many National Assembly delegates have rushed here and started registering on that day. The delegates are treated with thoughtfulness and care, and food, accommodation, and transportation have long been prepared. Apart from other things, when public buses are in short supply and crowded, the special buses for the National Assembly suddenly appear in a new posture, which cannot but attract attention. The carriages are spacious and the seats are comfortable. Looking in through the glass windows on both sides, it is easy to generate various fantasies. I wonder if the public buses in Beijing will ever progress to the level of the special buses for the National Assembly? According to a local newspaper, in order to satisfy the National Assembly delegates, all the waiters and workers responsible for the reception have received special training to avoid mistakes. Now the National Assembly is preparing for a small postponement in full swing. However, delegates from all over the country are still arriving in an endless stream, waiting here. The National Assembly Hall, standing majestically on Guofu Road, is still empty. This hall can indeed be called magnificent and beautiful. Not to mention the internal equipment, just the three large paifangs on Guofu Road that serve as accompanying trees are enough to be described as "spectacular." The postponement of the National Assembly seems to indicate that the political disputes have entered a new stage of negotiation, but in the past few days, the Northeast is still in darkness, and although the weather in Nanjing is clear, there are still layers of dark clouds blowing away from people's hearts.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Crowd Supports the Capital: The Market Trends Towards Prosperity <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The transition of the market from depression to prosperity is mainly stimulated by the continuous arrival of people returning to the capital and returning home. Of course, it is still a big question how much purchasing power the civil servants and wanderers who lived a difficult life during the Anti-Japanese War have, but after returning to Beijing, arranging a simple family requires a little something. At the same time, thinking that life will gradually become stable in the future, everyone wants to prepare some clothes, so when they first come, they will always spend some more or less money in the store. On the other hand, a small number of people who made a fortune during the victory spend lavishly, which also invisibly creates prosperity in some aspects. Every night, on the bustling streets, colorful neon lights shine brightly, the music is melodious, and crowds of people from afar gather in front of the glass windows, examining them carefully. In the Central Commercial Center and the Renaissance Commercial Center, people are shoulder to shoulder and flowing endlessly. Merchants are competing to use the words "Welcome the Return, 10% Discount" to attract customers.</p>

<p>With the increase in population, two problems are also increasing in severity: the housing shortage and the price of food. Finding a house in Nanjing now is no less difficult than it was in Chongqing. Are there no houses? No, that's not true. In fact, there are still many houses empty. The difficulty lies in not having the right connections, and even more difficulty is not having a large amount of legal tender. To rent an ordinary house, at least 500,000 to 600,000 yuan of deposit and 50,000 to 60,000 yuan of agency fees are required. If it is a slightly decent house, the number is naturally several times higher than this. Can people who have come from the mainland afford to rent it? Of course, the majority cannot afford it. The monthly rent almost takes up most of the salary. What about supporting a family and eating? What to do?</p>
<h3 id="e147">Parts Were Stolen: The Mobile House Was Moved <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The residences that the Executive Yuan prepared to build for civil servants do not seem to have left the planning stage yet. It is not known when construction will begin, and even if they can be built in the autumn, distant water cannot quench the immediate thirst. Some time ago, I heard that the mobile houses newly shipped from the United States could be set up near Minggong Palace. A few days later, I heard that two boxes of parts were stolen. So, the mobile house has already been "moved" before it was successful. As for food, it is the core of people's livelihood, and it is now facing a terrible crisis. Today, when there is widespread famine and soaring food prices across the country, it is not surprising that Kyoto has a food problem, but it will never be so severe. To be clear, human error is the main factor. On the one hand, the source of food rice is not smooth. Although the famous Wuhu is close to Beijing, the rice there is not coming in large quantities. On the other hand, due to the increasing number of personnel returning to the capital, the demand for food rice is also increasing. Good merchants have seen this as an opportunity to make money, so they hoard and speculate, manipulating the market. In addition, there is another factor that cannot be ignored: because Shanghai is very close, the fluctuations in food prices in Shanghai may have an impact on Kyoto. As a result, food prices increased from 17,000, 18,000, to 25,000, and then broke through the 30,000 mark, rising in a straight line.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Looking at the Market Conditions: Heavy Lead Pressing on the Heart <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The citizens of Southern City open the newspaper every day and look at the market conditions, and cannot help but shake their heads and sigh. Food prices are an indicator of prices, and daily necessities are also gradually climbing up with food prices. The threat to life is like a lump of crude lead, pressing on the heart and making people feel heavy. People who have just come from Chongqing have the beautiful fantasies of Nanjing shattered by reality. They all sighed and said: "We are late!"</p>
<p>Regarding the housing shortage and food prices, the Kyoto Provisional Senate, which is still meeting these days, has also discussed them, and they have become a highlight of the agenda. However, from discussion to resolution, from resolution to implementation, there are many processes in the middle, and the changes are naturally many, so no one dares to believe that the methods of the Provisional Senate will be 100% implemented by the administrative authorities. The Provisional Senate was held on the eve of the return to the capital, and its significance is quite significant. The senators feel that since Nanjing is the capital, all construction must be done in a model way, and many problems inherited from the takeover still need to be cleared up, so everyone has a desire to require that municipal administration be coordinated with future special needs, and to establish a modern urban scale.</p>

<p>However, during the session, there were two ironic scenes: one was the increase in public bus fares, and the other was the soaring price of grain. The sudden appearance of these two issues simply made it impossible for the councilors to back down. Everyone suddenly became furious. Public buses are a municipal enterprise and should not take the lead in raising prices, and the increase was a whole 100%. Everyone demanded that the municipal government withdraw the order, otherwise, all councilors would resign, and their attitude was quite firm. Under these circumstances, the municipal government, in order to respect public opinion, also decided to restore the fares to the levels before April 21st. Regarding the grain problem, the council repeatedly requested the grain commissioner to sell 7 million *shi* of stored rice at a fair price to stabilize the market and lower grain prices. This request was also granted. It is expected that the recent grain prices will no longer have drastic fluctuations. The provisional参政会 will end in a day or two, and the councilors have indeed spoken a lot on behalf of the citizens, but the citizens hope that it is not only about speaking, but also about reassuring people with facts.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Madam Marshall Says: Nanjing's Weather is More Lovely <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>These days, the spring rain is intermittent, with a slight spring chill. The peak of Zijin Mountain is shrouded in clouds, but when the sun shines, the sky is blue and clear, and the plains are bright and clean. When Mrs. Marshall first arrived, reporters asked her what her first impression of this place was. She said: She finds the weather in Nanjing more lovely than in Chongqing. Everyone who comes from Chongqing recalls everything in the mountain city, and feels genuine oppression from the heavy winter fog and the dust on sunny days. Upon arriving in Nanjing, seeing the clear sky and refreshing air, the warm sun and gentle breeze, one's mind suddenly broadens, and the feeling of confinement in the mountains disappears, replaced by a joy of being in the vast plains. On sunny days, I often stroll around Xinjiekou. This place seems to be the beating heart of Nanjing, with cars like flowing water and horses like dragons. The statue of the Founding Father stands majestically in the center, surrounded by a circle with flowers, plants, and ponds, where passers-by often rest. The city's traffic is still far from what it was before the war. There are very few public buses, and passengers are extremely crowded. Some public buses are replaced by trucks. The conditions inside can be easily imagined. One noteworthy and seemingly progressive fact is that the ticket sellers on the buses are all women. Whether women are physiologically suitable for this occupation is another question, but this proves that "equality between men and women" has evolved from an abstract slogan into a concrete fact.</p>

<p>I often see people sitting on the stone steps under the statue of the Founding Father, looking up at the distant clouds. Judging from their accents, they undoubtedly come from northern Jiangsu. The number of such people is increasing every day. Ten months after the victory, they still cannot live and work in peace in their own hometowns, and have to abandon their cultivated fields and businesses, flee and come to this unfamiliar capital. Do they have a place to live? A few have sought refuge with relatives and friends, eking out a living, but most are struggling on the edge, with no way to appeal for help. They are ordinary people with no party affiliation, fleeing the red terror and chaos, preferring to wander in a foreign land rather than return. How can they survive in the expensive city of Nanjing? According to the *Dagong Bao*, among the 600,000 people in Nanjing, 200,000 are unemployed. The accuracy of this number still needs to be verified, but it at least points to the seriousness of the situation. The chaotic situation continues north of the Yangtze River, and the number of refugees struggling on the edge of survival south of the Yangtze River is continuously increasing. They wander the streets and alleys of Jinling, looking north towards their homeland, recalling their families, and can't help but cover their faces and weep!</p>

<h3 id="e152">On Training "Language Sense" <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>I remember in a book discussing composition, Mr. Xia Mianzun talked about the issue of "infecting students with language sense." That article did not seem to attract much attention. Nowadays, many people regard the "New Literary Style" as a serious language malady, feeling that if general literary works do not remove the "New Literary Style" and focus on enriching the content, there is a general tendency to fall into "unnecessary groaning." Learning the common sentences used in vernacular Chinese to describe things, imitating the common vernacular Chinese phrases used to describe movement and stillness, even if there is no thought at all, can be piled up and decorated into an article that one thinks resembles vernacular Chinese.</p>
<p>In fact, a good article, whether in classical or vernacular Chinese, must have content. There must be words that have to be said, meanings that have to be expressed, just like speaking (writing is also a form of speaking). One must pour out the words hidden in one's heart to others, hoping that both sides resonate. Therefore, the only condition for a good article is sincerity. It must be able to truthfully reflect thoughts and life. An article is a record of thoughts and a reflection of life. Simply superficially piling up some clichés and decorating it with fancy phrases, without words that must be said and meanings that must be expressed, cannot be called an article, let alone a good one.</p>
<p>Last year, Professor Liang Shiqiu lectured on the topic of "The Disguise of Writing" in Chongqing, and he expressed many opinions on the basic attitude that should be adopted when writing. He said that the newly developed literature of the past thirty years is both a success and a failure. He believes that the failure lies in the fact that many so-called "literary youths" treat literary creation as a pretense, and without any cultivation in literary writing, they will pile up many commonly used adjectives in the new literature to create so-called "articles," full of exclamations and sighs (not exclamations or sighs expressed through genuine emotion), but without the slightest words that must be said or thoughts that must be expressed. One can often see this kind of content-free work in newspaper supplements.</p>
<p>Professor Liang naturally has his own insights, and the "New Literary Style" is indeed objectionable. Although the development of new literature in the past thirty years has not reached the point of complete success, it has at least made the content and form of artistic works closer to reality and more connected with life. As for the malady of the "New Literary Style" in writing, we can remedy it. We cannot suddenly deny the value of new literature because of these defects, although at the same time we must admit that the "New Literary Style" is a serious linguistic problem.</p>
<p>The biggest symptom of the "New Literary Style" is the emptiness of the content of the writing. Some people say that whether the content of an article is rich or not is related to the author's age, life, and experience, but the emptiness of content I am talking about here is not like that. It is naturally impossible for a junior high school student to write grand theories concerning national affairs and people's livelihoods, but even though their age, life, and experience are very young and shallow, they always have some words that must be said and thoughts that must be expressed, that is to say, they always have some content, even if the content is not as rich as that of an adult. The views are not as insightful as those of adults.</p>
<p>To remedy the rampant malady of the "New Literary Style," I think we can only adopt Mr. Xia's method, improve the function of "language sense," and remedy the "rotten and worn-out expressions" in vernacular Chinese. I think whether it is a word or a sentence, it always has to express a meaning. Writing is composed of words and sentences, and it must be a symbol that represents some meaning. Readers have different sensitivities to these symbols, which varies according to each person's experience and ability. Just like listening to a person give a speech or appreciating a painting, each person's sensitivity is different. The same word or sentence, some people only feel a little bit of its meaning when they read it, and some can feel a little more meaning. Being able to feel all of it is of course not an easy task. People who are learning to write, especially beginners, should put more effort into the feeling of words and sentences. If they can train themselves to have a sharp "language sense," they can recognize things, objects, situations, and scenes more clearly. Understand them more thoroughly, experience them more deeply, and feel them more fully. The "empathetic effect" in psychology naturally makes the words and sentences that one chooses when writing more appropriate to what one wants to say and more suitable for the thoughts one wants to express. Building a bridge between words and symbols used to express a certain meaning is really a basic method for training writing.</p>
<p>For example, the word "environment" is a common noun, but how many people have a deep understanding of its meaning? Even if they understand it, the degree of understanding of each person is definitely different. People who have studied sociology, psychology, biology, and education have very different degrees of understanding from people who have not studied those sciences. If you ask a student who has just graduated from elementary school, he may answer you: "The surroundings where we live are the environment." Furthermore, the meaning that everyone feels from the words "space" and "time" is also different. The two words "culture" and "life" do not seem particularly strange, as if they are very ordinary, but there are certainly not many ordinary students who can thoroughly understand their meaning. If these two words are put together to become the word "cultural life," then even fewer people can understand its true meaning.</p>
<p>If one cannot fully or mostly understand the true meaning of a word or sentence and grasp the symbol represented by the word, how can one use it appropriately and appropriately in one's own writing? Seeing the word "power" and thinking it is the power produced by rolling up one's sleeves and preparing for a fight, seeing the word "good" and thinking it is not doing bad things, that is either misunderstanding them or partially understanding them. Misunderstandings need not be mentioned, but even correct understanding is sometimes definitely not complete understanding, and the degree to which it is felt is bound to be very shallow. The same misunderstandings and one-sided understanding can also occur when selecting words and sentences when writing, making the words and the symbols used to express a certain meaning not true, suitable, or even incompatible. Using "desolate" where it should not be used, using "exchange" where it should not be used, so the whole page is "desolate" and "exchange," or the adjectives used are directly transferred from those that others have already used, and one does not first go through a feeling or experience in one's mind, but casually inserts some clichés, which of course makes the reader feel a headache.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not easy to thoroughly understand the true meaning of a word or sentence, because the nature of language is very complex, people's experience and ability are different, and the content of a thing or object is limitless, and using a certain word or sentence as a representative symbol is already a last resort. Using dead square characters (excellent writers should naturally make them come alive, as close to alive as possible) to express complex living things and situations is of course very difficult, and it is even more difficult to feel the meaning expressed from the words. Feeling the infinite content of the things represented from limited words is indeed a difficult task. Increasing the ability to feel and understand language through explanations, annotations, explanations, metaphors, looking up dictionaries, and turning to thesauruses has very little effect. Because it is rare to fully feel the meaning of a word or sentence, even the most skilled teacher is powerless, but he should always try to train a keen "language sense" so that students can feel what he understands.</p>
<p>A very common noun may contain multiple poetic flavors, and sentences that describe colors can allow people to experience inexhaustible emotions. This is all due to the reader's usual training. Do not easily let go of a word or sentence, but taste, ponder, think, and weigh it. When you start writing, you also need to put in this effort. However, paying attention to training "language sense" when reading will naturally be of great help to writing. Tolstoy once said: "To accurately express a certain thing, one must first choose appropriate words that can represent the meaning of that thing, nurture them in the mind, and then write them out." His words are very worthy of being remembered by beginners.</p>
<p>From the malady of the "New Literary Style," I thought of training "language sense." If the ability to feel and understand language is increased, coupled with the author's reading, observation, thinking, and enriching life, the works written will be more genuine and will not be "unnecessary groaning" with empty content.</p>

<p>— Ke Feng</p>
<p>A corner of the small window, the shadow of a silver wing flashes past my eyes, the blue sky remains, and all that is left is the tremor of a set of sound waves, a set of ripples in the soul.</p>
<p>Turning around, if you were already standing quietly behind me, how surprised I would be. How would I express my words of welcome?</p>
<p>I will embrace you warmly, I want to squeeze our hands until they are hot, until they hurt. I also have to carefully recognize you, looking at you from head to toe, not letting go of the front, back, left, and right. I need to carefully recognize: after enduring great suffering, struggling out of a life of wandering, how different are you from before?</p>
<p>The flames of war separated us, the flames of war trapped me in a corner of the Southeast and sent you on a wandering life. You traveled all over most of the rivers and mountains of the motherland, spending a full four years, and in this time, you grew up.</p>
<p>It was those times that made fun of us. In my mind, you are still a mischievous child of seventeen years old; and in your image, what kind of person should your older brother be seen as?</p>
<p>That is inevitable. Standing in front of your developed and strong body, I am comparatively withered and不堪. The pale hand in your thick palm is also soft and weak. I did not stand on the front line of this era's disaster, but I was repeatedly defeated by disease and depression. Now I have stood up again from where I fell, and I need you to give me a shot of powerful stimulant.</p>
<p>In this short period of time, you should go back and see your parents, who have been longing for you for a long time, as well as your brothers and sisters, and many other relatives. You should share with them this cup of reunion sweetness.</p>
<p>But what method can I use to salvage the shattering of your dreams? The real presentation is sad, because the carefully constructed thoughts and memories are about to be torn apart in an instant, and the brilliant colors will completely fade away.</p>
<p>What you are about to see are the white hair of your mother, the premature aging of your father, the thin and yellow faces of your brothers and sisters, the dilapidated fields that have been trampled on and will continue to be trampled on, rural tuberculosis... the dog at home will bark at you, the children in the neighborhood will squeeze into the crowd and peek at you, and the playmates of the past will compliment you on getting rich and becoming an official.</p>
<p>And some of the faces that earnestly instructed you before you left, you will never see again this time. They could not withstand the torment of low air pressure and stepped into another world early.</p>
<p>And I, I can't help but think of my cousin in the distant Northwest Plateau. In the northern wind of the mainland, the grass on the grave should not be green!</p>
<p>I wish you did not return with too high expectations. After a little warmth, you will feel unparalleled sadness, because the thoughts and memories you have carefully constructed have been torn apart in an instant.</p>
<p>The long sky is vast, the blue sky is clear, and just now a silver wing flashed past my eyes. Really, since receiving your letter saying "I will be flying to Shanghai as soon as possible," I have always had this feeling: when I turn back from a corner of the small window, I suddenly find that you are quietly standing behind me.</p>
<p>But, what method can I use to salvage the shattering of your brilliant dreams?</p>
<p>Go, this is not the place for you to stay, fortunately, this is only your stopover, you still have to go to the other side of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Without farewell, let us wish each other well!</p>

<p>— Chen Jinjiang</p>
<p>After eight years of desolation, even the Ai Li Garden has become much less attractive. But seeing the duckweed pond, the stacked stone walls, the shadows of the ancient buildings and maple trees, it still retains the demeanor of being admired by tens of thousands of people in those years. If it weren't for the sign "Flying Rapids Realm" erected on the distant pavilion, I really wouldn't know where to find the rapids. Walking up the pavilion, looking down at the duckweed, silently thinking about the deep meaning of being in the "Flying Rapids Realm," I can't help but chuckle at the endless inheritance lawsuit; is it because the pond water is imprisoned within the surrounding walls and stacked stones, that it does not flow, and therefore one cannot be aware of the "Flying Rapids"?</p>
<h3 id="e155">Old Beggar <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>The cold wind is mourning,</p>
<p>The cold rain is weeping;</p>
<p>On the street at midnight:</p>
<p>An old beggar staggers and wanders with a cane;</p>
<p>The dim street light illuminates a wisp of sparse gray beard.</p>
<p>He is very hungry,</p>
<p>So hungry that his stomach is only left with a wrinkled, thin skin;</p>
<p>His whole body is trembling,</p>
<p>How can the tattered robe, like a fishing net, block the knife-like wind and rain?</p>
<p>His heart is still anxiously worried:</p>
<p>I don't know where to live tonight?</p>
<p>He wanders aimlessly through several streets,</p>
<p>He turned into a small alley;</p>
<p>Light and shadows crisscross on the dirty, muddy ground,</p>
<p>The door of a small kitchen stall has not yet opened:</p>
<p>Under the brilliant electric light,</p>
<p>A young lady is scooping white rice one by one to feed the dog;</p>
<p>A glimmer of hope is born out of a myriad of despairs,</p>
<p>He immediately reached out his hand:</p>
<p>"Please do a good deed, young mistress!</p>
<p>Give me half a bowl of porridge to eat,</p>
<p>Have pity on me, I have been hungry for three days..."</p>
<p>But, before he could finish speaking,</p>
<p>With a bang, the door was already closed,</p>
<p>Only to hear a scolding from behind the door:</p>
<p>"You wretch, do you want to steal something again"?...</p>

<h3 id="e156">Doubly Paired and Flying Together (32) <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>After this letter was sent, Mrs. Mo eagerly awaited a reply, because she hoped that Mrs. Weng the Second could now offer her some assistance. She guessed that Mrs. Weng the Second's reply would surely point her to a way out. Because they were close friends who sympathized with each other. Moreover, she had exerted herself for Mrs. Weng the Second in the past, relieving her from difficulties.</p>
<p>Sure enough, before long, Mrs. Weng the Second's reply arrived. This letter further stirred up Mrs. Mo's already unsettled state of mind; it brought about a drastic change in her life, which had been stable for over a decade; and even threatened to overturn the fate of her whole family!</p>
<p>In the letter, Mrs. Weng the Second indeed pointed Mrs. Mo to a way out, a path that relieved Mrs. Mo's current anxiety and distress. Mrs. Mo did not have time to consider what the future held on this path, she resolutely decided to take her children and embark on it—a path that might be fraught with endless thorns. What was this path? It was to return to Beijing!</p>
<p>After Mrs. Mo announced this decision, she followed by busily planning the details of this decision. Lihua and Liyun had no opinion on this decision, nor could they have any; they simply could not understand, or imagine the impact this decision would have on them. They were naive. They could only obey orders.</p>
<p>But Baoling was different; he had already graduated from junior high school at this time; he already had thoughts; he had the ability to distinguish right from wrong. He believed that what Mrs. Mo was doing was absolutely wrong, especially he opposed Mrs. Mo going to find Mrs. Weng the Second, and with long-term plans in mind. Therefore, he worried about his sisters! He dared to assert: in Mrs. Weng the First's environment, Lihua would not receive a good upbringing! He consistently and deeply disliked Mrs. Weng the Second, he felt that Mr. Mo's death, as well as Mrs. Mo's plan to ruin the family this time, were all caused by Mrs. Weng the Second. In his heart, Mrs. Weng the Second was simply an unpardonable sinner!</p>
<p>"Mom, there's no need to go to Beijing! Going to Beijing is not a good idea. If you're worried that we can't make a living here, then I'll go out and find work, I would never make things difficult for you, Mom." Baoling earnestly dissuaded Mrs. Mo. "Besides, Dad has only been dead for a short time, we can't let him die with regrets!" Baoling's words had a double meaning, one was that he was afraid Mrs. Mo would follow the same path as Mrs. Weng the Second, and the other was that he remembered Mr. Mo often resented Beijing when he was alive.</p>
<p>"You don't understand, child!" Mrs. Mo said excitedly and stubbornly. "Since your Godmother has asked us to go, she must have a way. It's not entirely because I'm afraid of being trapped here, I just feel that living here without relatives or friends is too lonely. Going to Beijing, maybe you can go back to school. Your Godmother is doing well now, she will definitely help us."</p>
<p>"I don't plan to go back to school," Baoling replied stubbornly to Mrs. Mo. "If you must go to Beijing, then I will stay in Jingzhou, I will never go!"</p>
<p>Baoling hated Mrs. Weng the Second from the bottom of his heart, so he made the greatest determination to protest to Mrs. Mo and not go to Beijing. Which was also that he did not want to see Mrs. Weng the Second, or even be mixed up with Mrs. Weng the Second.</p>
<p>At this, Mrs. Mo was furious! She thought, "This only son I have doesn't even listen to me. I simply raised him for nothing! Come to think of it, it's all because Mr. Mo spoiled him when he was alive." Thinking of this, she was so angry! Mr. Mo made her lose her husband's affection in her youth, and now she was losing her son's love in her old age! If Mr. Mo was still alive at this moment, she would definitely have another fight with him to vent her anger.</p>
<p>"Fine, you won't go, you stay here alone. But I will sell the land and sell the house, let's see how you survive?"</p>
<p>"Didn't I say? I'll go out and find work, I don't need these fields and houses anyway." Baoling said without hesitation, not even looking at Mrs. Mo.</p>
<p>"Smack!" A heavy slap landed on Baoling's left cheek.</p>
<p>"You, you unfilial beast! You're talking back to me! You, is there still a mother in your eyes?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo was so angry that her voice was trembling, she wanted to go over and hit Baoling again, but Lihua held onto her clothes.</p>
<p>"Fine! Get out of here now! I never want an unfilial beast like you again." Mrs. Mo roared.</p>
<p>Baoling was stunned! This was the first time he had ever been slapped in his life! He didn't feel pain, only heat! He felt sorrow and humiliation! His emotions made him want to hit back at the person who hit him, but reason told him: the person who hit him was his own mother, he couldn't hit her! So he was saddened that after losing his father's love, he would also lose his mother's love! He was humiliated that this slap was brought about by the person he disliked, the culprit who ruined everything for him—Mrs. Weng the Second! He pursed his lips and didn't argue anymore, only stood stiffly to the side, until he heard Mrs. Mo's final order of expulsion, then he resolutely turned and walked out.</p>
<p>"Brother!" Lihua called out, chasing after him a few steps.</p>
<p>Baoling didn't respond, nor did he turn his head.</p>
<p>"Don't call him, let him go!" Mrs. Mo said with a hardened heart.</p>
<p>But, when Mrs. Mo turned her back, tears welled up in her eyes!</p>
