<h3>司使談當前局勢　決與馬帥努力促成和平　昨晤周恩來並訪宋院長</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕周恩來十四日上午十時半應約訪司徒大使，談兩小時始出，事後據共產黨代表團發言人稱：今日所談，仍爲軍事三人會議，必先停戰，然後才能談其他，並於十四日正式向司徒大使表示拒絕參加非正式五人小組會議，認爲該項會議不能解決問題，毫無意義，所謂改組國府委會名額一事，只在共產黨同意之十四個名額一點幾句話即了，無須開會商討。記者曾詢如五人小組會與軍事三人會同時召開，共產黨將採取何種態度，發言人稱：共產黨將不參加，同時亦不可能。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕司徒大使十四日接見周恩來後，即與其私人顧問傅涇波赴北極閣，應宋院長午宴，下午六時應友約外出，傅於同時訪吳鐵城晤談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕聯合社電所稱：「馬帥已拒絕接受中共要求重開軍事三人小組會議事」，記者十四日特以此就詢司徒大使，大使稱：此語正誤各半，因吾人仍在覓致妥適途徑，並仍本初意，政治商談要有成效後，才能再提軍事三人會議。並稱：在政治上果有所收穫，則其餘問題當易解決。記者旋詢以非正式五人小組會議政府方而代表吳鐵城所稱「該會並未流產」一語，大使作何看法，答曰：「然」，余亦認爲並未流產。至是，五人會議之存在，更獲得證實。大使旋笑曰：「目前局勢還是有希望」。記者再詢大使是否繼就此途徑再作努力，大使稱：「我還是努力，我比任何人都着急，我每天都想有一點新的發展，但是一直到現在，還未到公布時期」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕權威人士稱：馬·司兩民均建議先召開非正式五人小組　，然後召集軍事三人會議，以達到停戰和平之途徑，其初非正式五人會議雙方均已派定代表，旋共產黨竟以美方讓與剩餘物資　事爲藉口，而拒絕參加，倘五人會議能開成，自政治問題着手　序漸進，自可達停戰之途徑。有人懷疑如在非正式五人會議進行時，又提及政府五項要求，則又將如何，稱果有此事，則大可同時召開軍事三人會，俾軍事政治雙管齊下。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕據可靠方面消息，馬師，司使爲促成和平，始終努力不月懈，馬帥八上廬山後，司徒大使仍不斷與政府及共產黨代表接觸，希望於枝節整複，阻障重重中打開僵局，大使今午後五時半接見記者時，以樂觀語氣稱：「余對目前局勢之焦急，較諸君尤甚，惟談判尙未決裂，希望亦未滅絕也」。大使復稱「余與馬帥抱有同一意見，即先自政洽問題着手，而後解決軍事問題」。大使最後並曰：「馬帥與余將努力不懈，即或五人小組停開，亦必另爲設法」。</p>

<p>昨晨九時五十分，南京珠江路老虎橋首都監獄裏的東北角草地上，砰然一聲，倒下一個大漢奸梅逆思平，在勝利一年後，南京被蹂躪了的荒蕪土地，第一次澆上了奸醜的血淡。七時廿五分，梅逆被法警從夢裏喊醒，「所長請你談話」，他整齊的穿起了白紡綢衫，藍灰色褲子，細孔黑紗單底便鞋，步出了忠監第四號，他看到頭上是陰沉的天，面前是瞪着眼的記者們得利照像機，脚下是無情的泥土，他臉色變的鐵靑，他明白了，「你們爲甚麽不早些吿訴我，我還沒和我的朋友們握別，請你替我將一布包書扎拿來」。這時在一間廳房裏已布置了簡單法庭，首都高院檢察官陳繩祖坐在正中，監獄長孔祥線在左，書記官蔣福成在右，開始了最後的訊問：「你是梅思平嗎」？「是」。「你多大歲數」？「五十歲」。「你是什麼地方人」？「浙江省永嘉縣」。「你住在那裏」？「原來住在北平路四十二號」。「是不是爲漢奸案關起來的」？「是」。「死刑是首都高等法院判決的嗎」？「是」。「好的現在我們首都高等法院檢察處奉最高法院檢察署轉奉司法行政部的指令，你的抗吿已駁回，應即執行，你曉得嗎」？梅逆默然點點頭。「你現在不必再說什麽，你有沒有遺言給你的親屬和朋友」？「有的」。梅逆拿着法警替他取來的白布包，「我這裏已寫好了三份書札，但還沒有簽名寫日子，可否讓我寫一下？「可以的」。於是法警將公案分開來，梅逆就俯在案上一筆筆寫下了他的名字，第一份是請謝冠生部長轉呈主席的，一共三頁，開頭是一介公主席鈞鑒……」，中間還有「中華民族之前途」等字樣。第二份是上謝部長和洪陸東，謝　洲兩次長的信，梅逆說「我和他們三位是好朋友，這信是謝謝他們的友情，並請將我呈主席的信轉呈的」。第三份是給家屬的，給他弟弟們的一封，寫着「祖芳。祖蔭兩弟，我爲國家而死，爲淪陷區二萬萬人而死，於心無愧…………南北朝宋齊梁後魏諸鑑，可多閱讀……」。拾他妻子的一對，寫着「綬鄉，我平生不曾作過壞事，平生不曾作過對不起良心的事：……希望你好好敎育我們的子女，作有益社會國家的事……」。另外給他兒女的屛條是「努力讀書，忠貞報國」八個字。陳檢察官一一收下後，吿訴他「一定都爲你交到」。這時梅逆說，「我有兩個請求，第一是槍決還是絞決，第二是不要綁，我並請庭諭所屬，在我死後不要侮辱我身體」，檢察官說「第一點我們會盡量减少你的痛苦，第二點可以無虞，你還有甚麽說的嗎」？「我未向各同住友人吿別，深覺遺憾，再有就是請轉告我的家屬，盡可能把我葬在南京」。陳檢察官點了點頭，拿起筆在執行書上重重的寫了一死刑執行」四個字，在「梅思平」三字上下各勾了一筆，兩個法警扶着梅逆出了法庭，走入監後的空草地，向監獄的東北牆角前行，這時執刑的祝崑峯警長從後面一仰手中的二號盒子，「砰」一聲，槍彈從後腦進去，從右鼻出來，一股血噴了出來，染汚了一片凈綠的草地，梅逆思平結束了他荒唐的一生。上午十時三十分，地院檢察官汪紹曾法醫　英才，檢騐員宋士豪，率領法警前來騐屍，四十分梅逆胞弟梅祖芳前來洽商收屍，梅說乃兄家屬除大女梅愛文自脫離家庭後，迄無消息外，都在溫州原籍，梅逆的後事，將由他來料理。十一時，中國殯儀　的屍車拖了這巨奸的屍體出了大石橋監獄的後門，當經過「忠監」的後窗時，幾個大漢奸在林逆柏生的領導下，還鞠躬致敬，這羣冥頑不悟的東西，總有兎死狐悲的感想吧。（十四日自南京發）</p>

<h3>討論高經委會組織　立院會中起激辯　僉認不切需要議決緩議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕立法院第三〇七次例會，十四日上午九時舉行，到立法院委員六十三人，由孫院長主持，報告事項畢，討論（一）重行審查標凖法草案，議決通過。（二）最高經濟委員會組織條例草案，議決緩議。（三）所得稅法修正條文草案，議決，照修正通過。（四）修正國民政府參軍處組織法第九條，第十五條條文草案，議決通過。（五）本院委員陳安仁提議：草訂陪審制度法案，議決交民刑法聯合委員會研究。（六）修正戰時國家總預算編審辦法及科目表，修正預算法案，議決通過。（七）學校教職員撫恤條例及退休條例，修正條文草案，議決不予修正，照審查意見通過。（八）修正交易稅法草案，議決通過。（九）本院財政委會會同經濟委會，商法委會，報告研究財政經濟商法九人委會工作報告，議決，再行審理。臨時動議：（一）劉不名，陳長薔等十六人提由本院建議最高國防會審查。（二）劉不名等九人提：所得稅法免稅額，應依物價平均指數隨時調整案，議決交財政委會審查。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕今日舉行之立法院例會中，爭辯最烈者，厥為最高經濟委會組織條例草案之通過與否，若干委員均主張否決該項議案，其原因為：（一）國家經濟困難，此項委會組織龐大，似僅為若干官僚而設；（二）該會似為生產局之後身，然生產局尚在行政院之下，而該會寬直隸國民政府，現事過境遷，最好取消；（三）設此機構不能增加行政院效率，反而減低，且即有此種機構，亦不足以增加國際威信；（四）該會下設各部門，與行政院所轄有關經濟部門相等，人事亦然，若兩個行政院然；（五）如此種獨裁之經濟委會為全世界所無，其在理論上不應存在，就事實上亦等于不存在；（六）國家中興，應有大氣魄，似此為私人設立機構，實為小家氣；（七）國家已消耗甚大，如此案再予通過，則消耗更大，故立法院應立即提出撤銷，以減輕人民負担。以上諸種說法，均主張否決，為劉不名，李慶　，陳海澄等諸委員所提。旋馬寅初起直立發言，認為在事實上恐不能否決，如中央駁下來，則我們仍可再予否決，如一定要立法院通過他，可以改組立法院，另外換一批人來通過該案。至此，孫院長發言：「中央交辦事，如予否決，則屬違法，因現在尚非民選立法院，若為行政院交來，自可否決，現僅可作建議或重付審查。」結果，僉以該會既不切需要，且未經立法程序行成立「違犯法令，破壞紀律，」殊為不合法定，故議決緩議。</p>
<h3>非法議定長路資產　兩監事喪權辱國　東北清查團電中央請予處分</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十三日電〕記者十三日趨訪東北區接收工作清查團負責人，承發表關於中長路議定資產委員會高監事綸瑾，裘監事維營，非法簽字，喪權辱國之議決案詳情。據云：查中長路議定資產委員會組織法，原訂開會，地點係在重慶，委員為中蘇各三人。乃本年一月廿四日，高裘等二人在洽，竟與蘇方舉行會議，計開會十六次，在第一次會議席上，高監事向蘇方聲明政府授予全權，並承認會議為正式者。第二次會議時高監事於討論中聲明，我方委員二人出席，已夠多數，如意見一致，則第三委員自不能反對云云。第四次會議決議哈滿，哈緩，哈大，幹綫三條，計長二四六四公里，及支綫六條（大石橋至營口。金州至城子曈，大房身，柳樹屯。南嶺關至甘井子。周水子至旅順。周水子至大連）共長六二公里，連同所有大小車站及站內路綫，及應用技術房屋，及建築物，車站設備，同時劃為中長路財產。第五次會議決議煤礦支路及岔道十七條，約四百公里，連同所有車站房屋及建築物及設備品，同時劃歸中長路。第六次會議決議林場支路，及岔道約八百公里，連同所有車站，房屋，建築物，及設備品，同時劃歸中長路。第七次會議決議：石查子石灰支路，及岔道約一百五十公里，連同所有車站房屋建築物及設備品，劃歸中長路。第八次會議決議：沿綫醫療機關五十一處，連同所有倉庫，藥房，洗濯所，消毒所，建築物及設備品，劃歸中長路。其餘八次會議，有簽字者，有已通過尚示簽字者。二月廿七日，該團接哈市公民快郵代電稱，高綸瑾將松浦鎮松花江鐵橋，與三棵樹機車修理廠，石香坊一帶地皮，均作價賣給中長路。其變賣價款，中長路並不付現，作為我國在中長路投資。查松浦鐵橋，為我國拉（海）濱（哈爾濱）（呼）蘭（海）倫各鐵路必經之地，該高某承認每次列車經過該橋時，繳納過道費七萬五千元。煤一噸，繳過道費五十元。每日通過列車卅次，國家損失數目甚鉅。此外尤關重要者：為牡丹江至土城子，雞西至林口路綫，又牡丹江區綫，昂昂溪區綫，長春區綫，四平街區綫，遼陽區綫，共六處，我國國有鐵路與中長路交叉地點。不應將我國有錢路切斷若十公里，劃歸中長路，使我方行車不能到達最終點台。即使與中長路另訂合同，亦須交納多額過道費用，並不能免受其各種限制，至使國有鐵路之收益，一蹶不振，查高綸瑾，裘維瑩，其職務在於調查：何種產業為一九〇五年前中長路所有者，何種產業為一九〇五年後由國所有者，根據議程，資產委員會組織法訂定，由中蘇各派一員，三人會議地點在重慶，出席人數彼此三人，並無過半數條文，乃高綸瑾藉赴哈爾濱調查材料為名，即在哈舉行資產會正式會議，並未通知中長路理事會，如此喪權辱國，賣　非法已極，已電中央，予以處分。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>美國外交有歧路嗎？</h3>
<p>美國商務部長華萊士，前天向美國左派市民政治行動委員會發表演說，力言美外交政策有改結易轍之必要，其演辭要點有四：（一）英國在近東採取帝國主義政策，蘇聯亦採取報復政策，足使美國捲入戰爭；爭國非採取明朗的現實政策，即不能避免戰禍。（二）美國應以自已的眼光觀察世界政局，不能以親英或親蘇之眼光出之；美人雖愛英人，但以英國為美國外交政策之　點，則屬錯誤。（三）美蘇兩國應劃分勢力範圍，互不干涉。須處於兩大勢力圈之外；但對於世界貿易，中國應開放門戶。</p>
<p>華萊士以商業部長的資格，發表這種演說，在言論自由的美國，原不足重視；但華氏以前任副總統的資望，此次發表演說之前，會將演詞內容先請杜魯門總統核准，而車後杜總統又公開表示同意華氏的演說，況華氏在抗戰期間，日會來華訪問，對於遠東局勢，自極關切，這次發表演說，主張美國變更外交政策，不能不說具有重大的意義。但是華萊士所提出的新政策，在實踐上，是否毫無困難呢？美國的外交政策今天應否另闢跤路呢？且一述我們的看法：</p>
<p>第一，華氏所主張的新政策，與國務卿具爾納斯在德國斯都伽特城發表的對德政策，不論在精神上或在實質上，不僅互相抵觸，而且背道而馳。美國外交政策將何去何從？乃成為最嚴重的問題。杜魯門總統雖說，具華二氏的演說，並沒有抵觸的地方，但這句話產在太混糊了，有誰相信呢？所以全世界人士尚期待杜魯門總統的重言聲明。美國內部意見，恐怕分道揚鏣有此不可避免，而且兩條外交路綫的鬥爭，也將愈演愈烈。說不定，華氏的演說在美國外交界引起軒然大波；然而美國的人民與國會一琮會選擇他們的途徑。</p>
<p>第二，英國蘇三國合作，共同締造世界和平，原為戰後世界各國人民共同一致的期望。無如戰後三國，因為利害的衝突，步調異趨，乃造成打開目前的僵局，俾使戰後的世界，早日恢復常態。去年十二月初，具爾納斯也抱了絕大的決心，親自飛到莫斯科去，謀得英美蘇三國的妥協，企圖以三強協調作基礎，以解決戰後一切問題。當時人們看到三國外長所發表的宣言，誰不喜形於色，而認為世界的前途已充滿了詳和光明的景象；但是曇花一現，不久即告幻滅。這一段史實，足以證明欲令三強合作，實非一忠蹴可幾。共患難易，共安樂難！現在世界還沒有安樂，而美英蘇之間已如此，華氏豈遠看不出它的原因所在？</p>
<p>第三，美蘇衝突的地方，固不限於陸一隅，此在亞洲，亦復相同。於是對於中國問題，美國尤感　焦慮。按莫斯科三國外長會議成立協議時，對於中國部份，亦曾有所決定，簡言之，即三國不干涉中國內政是也。戰後中國既在五強之列，而三強竟宣言不干涉中國內政，在中國人看，已是跡近侮辱！今番華萊士演說，更以另不列入任何勢力範圍為言，好似這樣乃是尊重中國的獨立，其實此仍未能認清中國在遠東所應處的地位，中國人民對於這種態度，就不敢傾心領教。尤其可笑者，華氏仍未忘懷「門戶開放」，使我們對於華氏的用意，不能不有所揣成立聯合政府，這彷佛一方面說不干涉朋友飲食，而一方面却強迫他必須吃麵包，不好吃飯！</p>
<p>第四，在英美與蘇聯之間有矛盾，而在英美兩國之間，又何當無矛盾，使各國均能滿意，且能互相諒解，確是一個嚴重的問題。華氏演說中，稱英國在近東採取帝國主義政策。這一句話，已引起英國朝野的憤慨。預料英美間的齟齬，也在着隱若現的開始。世界政局，真要像一束亂麻；大家再不覺悟，理也無從理起了。</p>
<h3>馬帥八上牯嶺</h3>
<p>目前的國共商談，因為中共採取「拖」的手法，始終在那裏輪迴盤旋，得不到一個結論，使我們的調人，一再遭受挫折。但是調人抱着「決不灰心」，百折不撓的精神，仍不辭任何辛苦，繼績努力調處，企圖打開目前的僵局。馬歇爾特使又於前天飛往牯嶺了。這是馬帥第八次上牯嶺！這種知其不可為而為之的精神，實使我們又欽佩又愧慚。</p>
<p>聽說馬帥這次飛牯嶺的目的，乃在轉達中央主張重開軍事三人會議的建議，但又一說則謂馬帥已拒絕這建議。據中共發言人解釋，中共對於五人小組會議，認為未能獲得充分保證，恐難獲致和平，故拒不參加，面圖到老路，又主張重開軍事三人會議。但是中共的主張，有無絲毫的誠意，誰也不敢斷言。因為在我們老百姓的眼中看來，重開軍事三人會議，如能打開目下的僵局，則迅速召開五人小組會議，也必能獲致和平。而且軍事三人小組以前開了沒有辦法，停戰協定簽了也沒有效，中央再三頒過停戰令，共黨屢屢破壞，則重開軍事小組又有什麼用處？中共一味玩弄手法，除了他是故意節外生枝而外，實在找不出其他正當的理由。所以馬歇爾特使對此，原也非常冷淡，不過為盡人事起見，兼為接回其夫人計，自不妨再度飛往牯嶺，作最後一次的努力。我們對於馬帥的冒酷暑，薄雲霄，作上牯嶺，實在無話可說，但是誰要他老人家如此的？中共縱使存心「反美」，但欺人也該有個限度！</p>
<p>現在國共商談擱淺的瘡結，很明顯的完全在共黨方面。他們在口頭上高談和平，口口聲聲說「無條件和平」，但是按之實際，國內的戰亂，都是共黨一手造成，而軍事條件，政治條件又層出不窮。在敵人返投降之初，它和政府「爭降」；至「爭降」告一段落時，它又自恃其武力，到處擴充地盤，但不敢公然以戎首自居，因便躲在商談的烟幕下，從事破壞交通的陰謀。直到今天共黨的猙獰面目，漸已暴露無遺，其最終的目的，無非肢解國家，使統一的和平的中國，成為分裂的戰亂的中國而已！最近中共揚言，召開「解放區」人民代表大會，從而組織它的「中央政府」，雖然是一種威脅之辭，但也是中共野心的另一種說明。最近芝加哥太陽報記者，詳論中國時局稱，「中共阻擾和平，早已失去人民同情。」真是一針見血之談。</p>
<p>中國老百姓太懦弱了，也太可憐了！中國已經這樣與國家為敵，而我們老百姓正真調人馬帥一樣，還在那裏哀求共黨大澈大悟，「放下屠刀，立地成佛。」其實何嘗就有什麼希望？「多行不義必自斃！」中共將來或有這麼的一天。</p>

<p>〔中央社台北十四日電〕我國海洋學家馬廷英博士，近發現地球面上之陸地普遍增大，而海水位則逐漸降低，海水溫度亦逐漸變冷。渠現任台灣海洋研究所長，兼國立台灣大學教授，最近曾赴澎湖火魚燒島及蘇澳一帶，在台省東部海洋中採集珊瑚及食船之軟體魚等標本約十餘噸，渠稱：澎湖一帶海水深處之溫度，已由十三度降至十度左右，澎湖一帶之珊瑚及珍珠多已凍死，魚類因受寒冷，則多患傷寒感冒症，兩鰓流出黏液，成為僵硬狀態，浮游海面，每屆冬季，東沙羣島一帶之魚類，且飄浮海面，形成一厚層，水島因食料過多，則常安祥步覆海上，啄食魚類之眼珠，致使東沙羣島等地海面每年均有數月之「魚砲節」。馬氏稱：西太平洋之海洋研究，今後應由吾人擔負，渠認為：台灣四面環海，處於暖寒交流地帶，黑潮擁來之水產魚類極為豐富，未來一百年內，仍極有希望。渠又稱：台灣東界太平洋，海深達二千餘尺，西為台灣海峽，則係淺海，水深僅及一二百尺，故海洋方面之問題特多，已被一般海洋學界為優良「用武之地」。渠以為，我國對於海洋之研究，仍極落後，而目前則感缺乏人才。馬氏此次所採集之各項標本，一俟整理就緒後，即將分類編印，分贈各大學，漁業界及海軍當局，作為參攷。並聞渠在台灣環海從事研究後，即將出發，由閩海分向南北洋採集海洋標本，繼績從事實地研究，渠稱：倘余之工作完成後，即使我國之西藏及新疆，亦均可陳列一套海洋標本。</p>

<h3>貝爾納斯在巴黎　如聞晴天霹靂　華萊士演說引起軒然大波　范登堡述美政策基本理念</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十四日播：貝爾納斯與康納利·范登堡三人，在巴黎華萊演詞及杜魯門總統批准該項演詞事實後，「劃時代跳如雷」，彼等認為此事發生後，已使七星期來，美代表在巴黎針對蘇聯之努力，全功盡棄。貝氏等三人均將發表聲明，今日會自巴黎與華府通話數次，貝氏事前確未知杜魯門總統已批准此項外交政策演詞，當其聆悉此事後，曾保立甚久。美國代表並不諱言杜魯門總統已鑄成大錯。某代表謂，「蘇方是夜必雀躍歡呼矣」。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十四日廣播：美參義員范登堡發表對華萊士演說之見解，此間認此係對華氏之一種答覆。范氏略稱：美國之外交政策全賴美國之團結以為支持，而巴黎方面今是對此種團結，已表示懷疑。范氏謂：過去十八月來，我人政策分歧之兩種傾向，胥賴戰時共同一致之理念以為支持，共和民主兩黨大部人士遂得以團結一致之美國陣綫而對世界，此乃覓致和平組成集體安全之唯一途徑。凡背棄此一途徑者，均足危害我人所已宣布之目標。余確信大部份共和黨人，必仍樂於尋求與政府當局團結一致之道，站於美國之基礎理念，實現我人外交政策，毋取任何一方之獨裁，對他國不敵視亦不屈服，保障人權及基本自由，但所謂團結一致，我人亦須在政府當局機構本身內探求之。范登堡並稱：我人衹能同時與一個國務卿合作，葉萊士所發表之政見，似與國務卿貝爾納斯在巴黎所遵循者相逕庭云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十四日廣播：代理國務卿克萊頓昨日在記者招待會中聲稱，商務部長葉萊士之演說，其中一部分實遠反國務卿貝爾納斯宣佈之美國外交政策。克氏謂貝爾納斯近聲明，仍足以代表美國政策。克氏答復問話時稱，渠尚未接獲命令，改變美國對外交政刺以配合葉萊士之演說。若干方面說膽葉萊士演說之用意，謂渠贊成將世界劃分為列強勢力圈，並放棄美國對東歐人民復行波茨坦諾言之努力。此種勢力圈，貝爾納斯於今春演說時曾加以反對。國會方面對於華萊士之演說，發生不同之反響，同時非官方觀察家亦認為華氏演說，與貝爾納斯所闡明之美國外交政策，有所抵觸。</p>
<p>兩派主張分道揚鑣</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕以現在內情觀之，兩種趨勢日見明顯，即（一）杜魯門手中現兩種外交政策分道揚鑣，一為商務部長（即現內閣中故總統羅斯福碩果僅存之閣員）所主張者，一為國務卿所推行者。杜氏地位，對此兩種外交政策，均可以堅強支持。（二）高級官員實際上並不希望俠肝義膽照華萊士所提創者變更美國對蘇政策，惟究竟何去何從，須待杜魯門再度公開聲明，局勢始可見完本澄清。</p>
<p>華萊士與貝爾納斯本，對於此種軒然大波均過緘默，惟民主共和兩黨若十領袖已對於華氏演說及其引起之局勢，嚴厲加以批評。據共和黨參議員塔虎脫稱：總統贊成華氏演說，即「出賣其國務卿」。民主黨衆幾　　洛斯則電杜魯門稱，贊成華氏演說，即為「抽去貝爾納斯之　板，並使美國驚恐」。</p>
<p>遵循獨立外交途徑</p>
<p>外交界分析華萊士演說原文：發現三點與美國當前外交政策綱公領不符。（一）貝爾納斯雖間一再鄭重否認有英美反蘇集團之存在，但倫敦與華盛頓處理中東及東地中海方面政治問題，政策既完全並行，雙方最重大之決定，即反對蘇聯在士耳其　靼海峽之軍事擴張。華萊士命意，是否因此並行的外交行動，而主張美國外交政策應與英帝國主義政策分裂，華氏並未說明，但外交觀察家認為當不外此。（二）數月來美國於一切重大對蘇問題之基本態度，即一經案涉美國原則與利益，美國輒絕對不讓步。華萊士所謂對蘇強硬根本無濟於事，殆好指此。（三）美國政策以反對劃分世界勢力範圍為基幹，華萊士則主張，美國不干預東歐政治。蘇聯則不問拉丁美洲與西歐事。</p>
<p>至於杜魯門總統所謂貝爾納斯政策並無改變一節，則已相當的修正其贊同華氏演說之態度，蓋總統固會全力支持貝爾納斯之外交政策也。目前尚無徵象足以證明總統贊助華氏演說，即為美國對英或對蘇關係重大改變之表示。大抵總統欲使人相信，在其本人及貝爾納斯領導之下，美國正遵循完全獨立之外交政策進行，既不親蘇，亦不反蘇，如是而已</p>
<h3>華氏演說　別有用心</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十三日電〕外交界人士謂，華氏此次發表演說，別有用心，其目的在博得選民歡心，俾於一九四八年選舉總統之後，得在政治舞台上重演要角，惟其對蘇聯之友好態度，一再受人攻擊。華氏演說足以稱成全新政策之綱要，承認今日之世界劃分為兩大勢力範圍，中國仍處於此兩大勢力範圍之外，唯有為全世界商業競爭開放門戶。此外，若干政府方面人士，則以為由於英蘇兩國某方面之利害衝突無法避免，故欲將美蘇兩國之勢力範圍劃一明顯之鴻溝，使彼此互不干涉，實極困難云。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎十三日電〕和會兩委發生激烈之爭論，致英代表憤然退席，另一蘇聯主席於羣衆喧聯聲中悄離席，致被提出不信任動識。先是軍事委會中，英代表亞歷山大舉蘇聯代表史拉文對於阿爾巴尼亞有無權力表示其對義和約軍事條款之意見，發生激烈爭論後，憤然退出會議。和會對保政治委員會白俄主席基塞勒夫對於英國提案不予表示決而宣告延會，致會場嗶然，美代表卡弗萊對主席宣告延會提出異議，但主席基賽萊夫即悄然退席，事後委員十三人中八人破例通過對基氏不信任動議，宣佈其延會為不當。爭執之起因為希臘修正案，要求在有利於希臘之條件下，改正希保邊界。蘇聯代表提出反對謂，該案於八月二十日截止期以後始行提出，不應在委會中討論。英代表華納提議將希臘修正案是否應在委會抑和會中討論，提付表決，至是主席基寒萊夫突然宣告延會。</p>

<h3>市參議會　各局報告　全部完畢　不滿教育現狀　引起激烈質詢　市長交議延長夏令時間遭否決　今是舉行全體審查會</h3>

<h3>李熙謀　報告教育　深盼市立各學校　避免機關官僚化</h3>
<p>參議會第九次大會由敎育局副局長李熙謀報吿，略稱：本年度工作中心：一，推進國民敎育，增設市立學校。二，籌建中等敎育區，推進職業敎育。三，擴充社會敎育，加强民衆識字運動。四，實施分區督導，嚴格執行。五，設立科學勞作中心站，集中訓練，以補各校經費之不足。</p>
<p>目前最大困難爲校舍不够，若十區目行捐款，辦設學校，良可倣效。再者，市立學校分配，殊不平衡，各區市校多少，相差極大。本市一般學校缺點，爲圖書儀器欠缺，淸潔衛生健康敎育不够，以及女子學校缺乏家事訓練。敎育局深盼市立各校，避免機關化，官僚化，職工不宜太多。其次希學學校當局能與學生家長合作，成立家長委員會，解決各種困難。</p>
<p>附帶報吿：關於私立學校收費，考慮很久，而敎育部亦有命令，希望對各校收費能够從寬。故敎育局對私校收費，不加限制。但規定應有百分之二十免費額。至於市立學校收費，係供擴充班次之用。</p>
<p>關於敎育基金，錢市長曾答應十億元，但截至本年五月底僅收到五億元。迄今未自中央銀行中提出。</p>
<p>尊師運動，原定總額十億元，現已收到者計八萬八千七百餘萬元。由立信會計事務所審核無誤。尊師獻金，獲得各界熱烈協助，紗廠界帮忙更多。付出項，計付市立學校敎師四萬九千四百十九萬元，私立學校敎師二萬零六百十九萬元，另由市府補助二萬萬元。總共支出八萬一千七百四十一萬四千元。因內有各大學募款四千九百六十五萬元，由彼等自行支配，尙餘六千九百二十萬三千元，擬分配與各私校敎師，或併入敎育基金云。</p>

<h3>私校收費太高　家長不勝負担　更有考試護航隊之舞弊行爲　各參議員　羣起質詢</h3>
<p>敎育局副局長李熙謀報吿施政完畢後，開始質問，各參議員對本市私校收費不加限制，指資頗厲。首由姜懷素開砲，稱係痛苦陳述，並非疲勞轟炸。敎部雖令對各校收費放寬，但並非放任，而敎育局在詳加考慮後却不加限制，以致家長皆不勝負担。戰前小學學費四元至十四元、即使以五千倍計，亦不過二萬至七萬元，目前小學收費六萬至十二萬元，已遠超過戰前標準，豈可謂之公平合理？李副局長答稱：對目前各私校收費情形，敎育局亦不滿意，但敎育局及市長皆會與各私校當局談過，情形殊感困難，缺乏面面俱到之方法，敎育局對私校收費雖不限制，但規定各校必須有百分之二十學生免費，以容納清寒子弟。此時，陸蔭初起立發言稱：學費應加限制，若干參議員鼓掌，更有多位參議員羣起指責敎育局不負責任，並堅決要求限制學校收費。</p>
<p>李副局長一再答稱：現在對學費不加限制已決定，更改恐有不使，且難行通，倘參議會決定學校收費應加限制，以後敎育局當可照辦云。吳市長鑒於各參議員對學費問題，密切注意，乃對此事加以說明謂：目前有二問題：一，學校不能充份容納學齡兒童。二，學校收費過高。此二點粗看似不相關，其實關係密切。各私校曾聯合會議，對收費有所決定，而敎部又有指示。倘敎育局嚴加限制，私校可能辦不了，則學齡兒童，困難更大。市府曾召集校長會議，嚴令小學必須有百分二十之免費額，中學必須有百分十五之免費額。學校經費存於銀行內，利息亦一併計算。開校後將全部開支預算報吿敎育局，由敎育局派督學嚴査，收支是否符合，待遇是否過高，經費是否公開、校款是否被私自挪用。同時希望參議會對敎育經費審査時，特別注意，看能否予以提高。唯據王維　向記者表示　敎育局經費支配，無明確規定，審査預算，頗爲困難云。</p>
<p>關於敎育局其他質間，因時問關係，李副局長略答如下：農村補習學校，正積極籌設，廢除升學考試一點，將來市校畢業生或可不參加升校考試，直接入學，但校內考試必須嚴　辦理。各校有考試護航隊，代靠舞弊，深盼各校自動糾正。組織識字運動委員會，擬請黨團協助。私校改爲市校，經過調査後，可以實現。整頓校風，採用分區督導。整頓師資，進行敎師檢定，實施短期師實訓練。</p>

<p>當議長宣佈請社會局吳局長報吿後，全塲議員即報以熱烈掌聲，吳局長登臺後，　先報告糧政，謂本年五月糧價暴漲，本局緊急措置即登記存糧，嚴禁非法米商之操縱，並由糧部協助運川贛米濟滬，始得發過危機。今年各地豐收，新米業已登場，政府爲穩定糧價，保持每石四萬元之水平。本局糧食科僅主持行政，米糧與款項，皆未經手．調解勞資糾紛爲本局繁重工作之一，去年年底罷工怠工紛至沓來，本局調處勞資糾紛依照社會部四項原則：（一）保障工人合法利益，（二）整頓勞工紀律，（三）一切交涉應照法定程序，（四）不變更底薪及市政府市商會所提出之辦法與意見進行調處工作。全市工潮以本年三月份爲最高潮，全月罷工怠工五十四起，至八月編制統計時，則未有發生。工潮消除原因，不外（一）工會領導者之得力。（二）工人已瞭解目前工商業之危機，不作過份要求。（三）政府有消弭工潮安定產業界之決心。當時之區工會制實爲工潮之禍根，現由於工業界之協助，使本局順利推進改革區工會制爲廠工會制。勞資評斷委員會解決一二三區針織業减低工資照八五折生活指數給薪，實爲一大成就。吳局長又報吿福利慈善事業預算原爲八億元，但到現在爲止，實數領到僅八千萬元，社會局因鑑於市府財政困難，故呈請行政院請撥專款九億元，雖得批准，但由行總撥付，因行總無款，故迄未領到分文。無經費，無房屋，是以慈善福利事業不能再事擴充之一因。最後吳附帶報吿錢莊申請復業衆多，及財部之二項原則。旅館戲院兩業已經取消限價制度，但絕對不准旅館恢復小賬。今後戶口糖之配給，將由民政處主辦。</p>

<h3>大會花絮</h3>
<p>參議會開會已有六天，每日來去逸園　次，不但新聞記者在會塲上大打呵久，連議員們也感到精疲力盡。議員們出入大會，每人皆挾紙袋數包，有如學生上學，議員們自已亦說：「上　去了！」</p>
<p>昨日吳局長慨先資覆口頭詢問後，因　問不及，以後詢問擬採用畫面，但有人仍　口頭再問。瞿鉞表示異議說：「口頭詢問時，詢問詢問就要詢問到旁邊去，好像無軌電車一樣」。</p>
<p>昨日下午參議會二樓旁聽席上造成開會以來最熱鬧之塲面。原來旅館業職工到會請願，因社會局長所報吿的，和議員質詢各點，與他們有切身關係，因此聽得津津有味，很緊張的樣子，直到散會始離席。</p>
<p>今日上午八時工務局將招待參議員往浦東參觀　塘工程，但上午日程已決定召開全體審査預算會，議長恐怕參議員都跑光了，開會人數太少，所以特別提醒大家。</p>

<h3>參加清查團　趙君豪等五人當選代表</h3>
<p>昨日上午，參議會選舉參加清査團之五名代表，結果由王先靑（九一票），趙君豪（八七票），何元明（八六票），水祥雲（五二票），王劍鍔（四五票），當選，但王先靑因曾參加接收市商會，水祥雲曾參加接收郵務工會，自請放棄，改由次多數朱學範（三八票〕，馬君碩（三六票）充任。詹文滸提議，由大會支付若干車馬費與各代表，決議由議長副議長酌定。馮有眞提議由大會公吿市民參議會，已選舉參議員參加清査團，徵詢市民對接收機關之意見，並協助檢舉接收舞弊，密吿函可逕寄參議會。決議通過。最後，潘議長再度說明，淸査團工作係採合議制，處理各種案件時，由淸査團團長，各委員及參議會代表合議云。</p>
<p>據代表之一何元明語記者稱：淸査工作艱難異常，非有相當時間不可。僅接收機關之目錄即有數箱。但代表等均盼能做到「秉公淸査，毋負衆望」二點。俟接獲淸査團答覆後，五議員即將舉行小組會議商討進行計劃，必要時將請求清團再予延長時間，俾澈底清查。</p>
<h3>不良刊物　肅清遊民逐步實施　社會局長吳開先答覆質詢</h3>
<p>吳局長報吿畢，主席宣布休息十分鐘，繼之各參議員紛紛提出口頭質詢，首由趙仰雄議員發言，詢問社會局對馬路上不良兒童讀物如何不澈底加以取締，章祝三參議員繼起質詢：勞工福利基金因何不依法推行，如何辦理勞工子弟敎育，及滬西之勞啊醫院應收歸政府辦理等三題。朱參議員學範根據報載質詢三點：（一）廠方誣吿勞工，及工會人員會遭捕，議當局今後切實保護工會，不再　便拘人，（二）工會正式成立後，所派之指道員，應立即撤消，不應再改稱爲顧問名義，繼續存在。（三）失業工人應如何救濟，尤其乘自後方之失業工人，應迅謀救濟辦法。次爲昨日唯一發言之女參議員湯桂分提出有關婦女三問題：（一）禁娼後應予妓女以出路。（二）濟良所從速成立，（三）女工小產，照生產期工資减半，極不合理，應請另行規定。渴議員詢問畢，潘議長則宣佈暫停質詢，先請吳局長答覆。</p>
<p>吳局長依次作答：書攤不良讀物其審査事宜當經社局主管科負責，惟違審私自出版者亦有，該局對於誨淫誨盜之畫册，曾會同警局嚴加取締至方型黃色刋物取締亦嚴，對各發行人並已分別予以警吿。難民難童收容所，收容量已過飽和點，社局雖有意肅淸全市游民，然因限於若千事實，以致心有餘而力不足，將來俟財力物力充裕後，自當逐步實施。福利　　之未能普遍推行，其原因在工商界太身之不景氣，若景况好轉，決照福利器　條例實施。勞工醫院，已有十餘年歷史，且有董事會，政府未便隨便接收如果辦理不善，由政府督導，使其改善則可。至廠方誣吿工人，如遭遇非法情形，可由法院　司法解決，社會局對工會及工會職員，自應負責，決予保障。救濟失業工人，自屬應辦，惟後方來滬失業工人，實非地方政府之力所能及，應由中央負責指導辦理，現特將修理被炸之公大紗廠供後方失業工人居住，由行總供給伙食。工會成立後，指導員確應撤銷，如有尙未撤銷情節，可報吿本局査究。對湯女士之質詢，吳局長答稱：漕河涇收容所，亦曾收容一部份妓女，唯管理極爲困難，濟良所自應從速設立，聘專家主持，女工小產期內工資意見，可送立法院及社會部，以供修正勞工法時之資料。吳局長答畢，潘議長因另有要案討論，故暫停質詢。唯有范錫昌參議員再問指導員是否定需社局職員充任，吳局長答稱：全市工會共有三百多，社會局職員，無法分配，故亦可由他處聘請，凡曾從事民衆運動有經騐者，皆可充任。至此停止質詢，討論提案。</p>

<h3>跑馬廳畔話掌故　一頁洋人侵占史</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫」賽馬和跑馬廳的問題，雖然到今天還沒有在市參議會大會上正式討論過，可是這幾天議員們和市民們對於這兩個問題注意和議論的程度，確可說是到了白熱化。</p>
<p>注意儘管注意，討論儘管討論，不過，我們在對這件事決定一種意見前，必須得把事情的眞相研究明白。關於上海要不要繼續有賽馬，我們可以取決於民意。這裏所要向續者報道的是跑廳的產權問題，同時也就牽涉到了它的當故。</p>
<p>記者爲了這事，特地請教了上海中醫師公會常務理事陳存仁參議員，陳是故上海問題專家姚公鶴的門生，因此對於上海各種歷史都有很深的研究。關於跑馬廳的掌故資料，現在已經非常缺乏。承陳存仁費了許多實貴的時間，經各種史料中找出了下面的全篇故事：</p>
<p>英人一匹馬·農民兩行淚</p>
<p>現在的跑馬廳原來已是西人所辦的第三個了。遠在一八五〇年（淸道光三十年），有英人董事四人，在南京路拋球塲現在麗華公司原地闢了一個相當大的空塲，用來作爲打彈子和拋球遝動等，故名拋球塲。當時由上海道台和英領事根據洋涇浜章程（即租界草程）規定每畝地可以十五千文出買。那時候拋球塲以西都是一片荒地，人烟絕跡的地方。到了一八五四年（咸豐四年），拋球塲塲的董事就把地皮全部出售，另外往西發展，在現在永安先施公司一帶地方闢了一個「新公園與跑馬塲」，其地佔面積很大，四面臨湖北路，浙江路，芝罘路和北海路。後來這一段地區也漸漸地繁榮起來了。於是到了一八六〇年（成豐十年），他們又把全部地產以高價出售。這時候上海發生了「泥城之戰」，就是小刀會和英國兵在南泥城橋地起了衝突，戰塲就是在南泥城橋之北、即新世界一帶。這時候的整個四藏路是一條浜叫做「周涇浜」一面是一條洋涇浜（即舊愛多亞路）。英國軍隊就在臨周涇浜西面一塊地上駐起了隊伍。那時候中國正値太平天國時代，朝廷上對這件匪亂的案子也未加注意。結果小刀會宣吿失敗，退兵以後，到了相常時，英人宣佈收買周家浜（西藏路）西面的地皮作爲新的跑馬應。英國人用了一匹馬，從西藏路南泥城橋起（新世界口）向西再南經蘆花蕩（即現在的馬翟路）繞了一大圈，直到周涇洋涇浜交叉現在東方飯店的原址，所經各點，都豎起一個一個的木標，再把繩子圈起來。這一圈出了現在的跑馬廳，佔地共計四百三十畝。可是這圈內完全是中國老百姓的農地和墳山。沒有疑問的是一種强佔行爲。這是在一八六二年（同治元年），於是他們就開始强迫農民出買地皮，每畝仍爲十五千文。用了許多買辦和地保在中間「刮地皮」，使他們也中飽了不知多少的大洋鈿。英國人把地强佔之後，就劃塲地爲內外兩圈。可是其中也發生了許多糾葛。大多數的民衆都拒絕出賣，墳山也不肯搬走。最近陳存仁曾訪問上海聞人趙晋卿，據說趙家有一處五代墓地二十畝，由地保主持運墳及遷墳費僅給他五十千文，他也是拒絕出賣的一個。附帶要談起一個故事：跑馬廳內至今還有一塊石牌樓，人們都疑信是趙晋卿家，又說是張　　家建立的。其實這些都不可靠。這塊牌坊是一個叫「許元來的妻子趙氏」所立，建於乾隆五十三年。當趙氏二十三歲時，丈夫亡故，趙氏守節撫養嗣子成立，死時八十三歲。牌坊名「旌節坊」，外國人叫它「寡婦榮譽坊一。因爲許家在常地很有勢力，所以這牌坊就沒有被拆掉。</p>
<p>圈地再賣地·洋人發洋財</p>
<p>跑馬廳圈地以後，圈內的農民都被趕得精光，絕對禁止中國人入內，原地主進去都被打出來，祇有極少數穿西裝的華人，偶然可以由外國人陪同進去。可是當時頑固强暴的帝國主義勢力並不能制服民衆的憤慨。圈內民衆因私地被外人所佔，跑馬兩次遷換圈地，大大的發了二次財，買辦和地保舞弊又甚大，都羣起而提出抗議。上海道台亦無法應付，祇得和英領事雙方換文（即照會），文中規定：「此地收買後專作跑馬與打球之用，永遠不得出售並不准建造其他與跑馬打球無關之房屋，或出租或出售。」就爲了這一個換文，所以跑馬廳從此不能翻進翻出的賣地圈地了。據下芳濟所作上海史中記載一八六二年將第二個跑馬應（先施永安所在）賣掉的時候，得到白銀四萬九千四百二十五兩，可是買進現在馬霍路跑馬廳時候，僅僅以一萬二千五百兩銀子購到了廣大的農地四百三十畝，這是多麽驚人的西洋人發財方法啊！</p>
<p>事實上跑馬廳內業主共有三百二十五戶，其中領款者僅二百〇五戶，其他一百廿戶堅不前往領款，到一八九五年（光緒二十一年），業主忍無可忍，特地請了一位英國律師向領事館提起訴訟，結果判決英董應再賠還每一業主銀子十兩。但此一百二十戶仍不願領款，剩下的一千二百兩以四百兩作律師費，八百兩由英領事送到上海縣衙門，貼了一個佈吿說：「望各業主前來領款，如三月內仍不來領，應即作無效論」。結果那些錢還不是到了衙門老爺口袋裏去了！</p>
<p>但是業主依舊不服。光緒二十五年租界擴充，英國人想出了一個好辦法，就是請一部份舊地主來常馬伕。一方面也准許他們在沿靜安寺路小浜（最近塡平）外搭立木版活動看台，從新世界起一直綿延到馬霍路，那些看台都是用幾塊木板搭在長橙上，板上再放幾張長橙，有人來看就收取幾個銅元。工部局方面也不收他們的捐稅，並且用不着什麼照會，算是優待他們。那佩時候因爲圈內依舊不許華人踏進去，所以圈外看台生意也很不差。</p>
<p>到了宣統元年，英國人忽然改變計劃，開放華人購票入內，於是圈外的看台，一方面因爲生意清淡，一方面因爲交通不便，隔了許多年便無形中取消了。</p>
<p>當時圈內的看臺也非常簡陋，到一九三三年把舊臺拆去。一九三四年（民二十三年）二月二十八日鐘樓新廈落成，以上就是跑馬廳的故事。</p>
<p>跑馬不跑馬·一人說一套</p>
<p>其次，我們要講到跑馬總會的地權問題。跑馬廳現在的業主分關係的，在跑馬總會的立塲上說，凡是總會的會負都有經跑馬，儘管參議會反對跑馬，我相信他們還是要「跑」，這是什麼理由呢？主要的說來有三點是他們可以提出的：（一）會內本身有權跑，（二）跑馬含體育性（非會員不能跑），（三）跑馬廳係公私難分的私產。因此在上次臨時參議會決議改建公園等等都不能有結果。</p>
<p>那末，怎樣才是解決問題的合理辦法呢？據陳參議員的觀察是第一：應按照土地法徵收全部土地，依照這個法令，那末如樊克等法學家都無法拒絕。（可是決沒有這許多錢）第二：徵收土地經費浩大，其理想的辦法必須由市參議會組織專門委負會鄭重硏究擬具。不過在原則上，不妨根據二點：（一）仿照大上海計劃重行募債組織進行之。如果照市長所計劃在二年內抽取二成積蓄基金，這在事實上是萬萬不可能的。若按一月徵收五億元計算，二年祗能徵得一百二十億元，這區區的數目連買馬廐的一小方地方還不够。倘若日夜跑馬，連跑十年亦沒有多大帮助，但是吳市長運用外交手腕也很有意外的可能性，因爲跑馬應的產權，九十六年到今天。公私變來變去。究竟怎樣已弄不淸楚了。不過市參議會組織專門委員會搜索文獻，徵訪舊地主研求辦法是斷斷少不來的（二）根據跑馬總會的規章「跑馬含體育性，非會員不能參加」。那末公開賣票有違原規章，買票賭博有遠國家法令，華人入內賭博，政府當局有權干涉加以禁止。這樣，除非跑馬總會祗想利用四百三十畝的廣地關緊門來鍛鍊外國人的身體不想賺錢，那末除了市長有外交手腕或我們有錢徵收土地外，也無法把他們趕出去的</p>
<p>這是一個相當嚴重的問題，記者在參議會中，不時會聽到議員們談着跑馬問題。但探問結果，似乎多數是不贊成跑馬的，尤其不贊成在市中區跑馬。吳市長主張跑馬收稅，二年後收回地權，這並不能說他是贊成跑馬，他祇是要想法把地皮收回。不管他的辦法是否理想，他的苦心是值得歌頌的。</p>
<p>上海在今天，產生了民意機關。我們期望人民的賢明代表們能籌劃一個最合適的辦法，爲我們全上海的人民。收回我們自已的土地。找出最有效而具體的辦法來，往往比理論上的爭辯和解釋强得多。</p>

<h3>英商電車昨停駛　經各機關調處　今日可望恢復　擊傷巡官之兩售票員　各處罰金千元釋放</h3>
<p>（本報訊）前日本市英商電車公司廿路無軌電車基售票員，與市警察局長寗路分局巡官三人，在中山公園附近，因搭車發生衝突，售票員被帶往該管分局訊辦。昨日該公司司機售票員等，即實行罷工。記者爲明瞭眞相，特走訪市　察局負責人，承告如次：昨（十三日）晚八時許，行駛靜安寺中山公園間之廿路無軌電車第三五〇號車，駛至中山公園終點，乘客異常擁擠，</p>
<p>爭先搭車</p>
<p>是時有本局長甯路分局巡宮張德森，王紀綱，劉啓雲三人（均着便衣），亦隨衆登車，張王兩人先上，劉啓雲正擬跨上車時，售票董立生（號碼九六〇）驟將鐵門關閉，經張巡官吿以尙有一人，請其啓門，不料該車另一售票員王國華（號碼一一八五號）將門略啓即關，致將劉巡官之腳踝軋痛，互相口角，該售票員竟持發以軋票之帖鉗猛戳劉巡官左眉，洞穿二穴，張巡官亦被鐵鉗鉗去臂肉一塊，當時該三巡官等均未還擊，隨將售票董立生王國華兩人一併帶往該管長寗路分局訊究，電車職工會理事長聞訊趕至分局，目睹該售票員等</p>
<p>並爲受傷</p>
<p>詎事後竟有人籍端煽動職工罷工，擴大風潮，致今日英商電車全部停駛，電車爲公用事業，不可一日中斷，此種舉動，殊屬破壞社會秩序，値茲時局動盪之秋，深虞有搗亂份子從巾煽惑，本局負有維持社會安寗秩序之責，除勸令電車職工迅子復工外，對於幕後操縱人物，將予依法査懲云。</p>
<p>又訊：前晚中山花園警官與電車售票員發生科紛後，公司中買辦陸季春，偕英商電車產業工會理事長仇長江，驅車至該管長寗分局，</p>
<p>要求釋放</p>
<p>被捕售票員，直至清晨三時，始按照違警法各處罰金一千元，由陸仇兩人具結，一併外出。並有仇長江口頭担保，翌晨各路車輛照常行駛，至受傷一劉張二警官，當晚自投同仁第二醫院醫治，醫藥費亦自行撥付。據醫師云，劉啓雲上額裂傷兩處，張德森左肘　　皮傷，左　部輕挫傷。至昨日薄幕時，劉啓雲之創口突然發炎，症象變化，定今晨投地　處法醫檢騐所診　。而電車工人於昨晨起竟</p>
<p>實行罷工</p>
<p>吳市長開訊後，當飭警察社會兩局會同淞滬警備司令部稽査處，迅往關處，謀合理解決。聞工會方面已接受各機關調處，允於今晨復工行車。但聞工人方面，因上次罷工時期，有某工友以煽動風潮嫌疑被捕覊押，業釋放，現要求當局釋出該工人，爲附帶復工條件。故是否能復工，尙未可逆料。</p>

<h3>輪船業議決　客票增四倍半　呈部核準後將自廿一起實行</h3>
<p>交通部鑒於國內各地不定期貨船　多，而行駛固定舫綫之客船甚少，至使客運陷於停頓狀態，爲謀補救起見，頃特電令上海航政局會同輪船業公會及招商局討論改進辦法，業經輪船業公會理監事會議決定，恢復「航綫委員會」各公司調整各航綫行駛船期舶，以謀供求之適合，並決定對於維持固定航行之定期班輪，由政府予以特殊之權利，以資補助，其法如免派軍差，及配售價格較廉之燃料等。</p>
<h3>維持航運　新訂四等等票價</h3>
<p>又各航綫客票價目，自本年三月一日調整以來，已歷半年，航商鑒於目前物價已漲起數倍，修理物料工資等開支激增，原有客票價目，不能維持，且因票價過低，黃牛黨常向蝓船公司套購客票，以數倍黑市價格轉售與旅客，從中牟利，而正當旅客反朱得其利，經各公司及輪船業公會要求調整票價，以資維持，由該會理監事聯席會議及同業會議數度討論，客票價格，決按原價增四倍半，新訂四等票價如下：滬津綫六萬五千元，滬靑綫四萬二千元，滬甬綫一萬二千元，滬溫綫一萬八千元，滬閩綫三萬元，滬粵綫八萬元，滬漢綫五萬二千元，該公會並定自本月二十于日起實行，一面另行呈部請求核准云。</p>
<h3>颱風消散　各輪恢復航行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上週海南島洋面，突起兩颱風，影響船舶航行，招商局海粵輪在海口，遇風被襲，各情業誌前報。昨據外商航業界訊南洋兩颱風，現已消散，各輪已恢復航行，惟船期因之梢有延緩，怡和永生輪，太古北海輪，依照預定船期，昨日可到滬，在滬曾避風二天，約明日（星期一）方能抵此。海粵輪遭風襲後、船身略受損壞、日內駛港修理。渣華公司芝楂運加號，首次復航，由吧城來滬原定十六日進口。據該公司宣稱：須延至十九日可到，定二十一日離滬　返爪哇，恐亦將延期。順亨洋行經理之蘇梅凡爾號，亦延期至十八日抵滬。華綸洋行經理之海斯椗號，約下星期二三到埠，來貨大部爲商品。</p>

<h3>摸竊大遊行　有罪不敢抬頭　武裝監視下秩序整齊　地檢處頓有人滿之患</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「摸竊大遊行」，在昨天早晨已在全副武裝嚴密護衛之下，隆重舉行，參加遊行的「鼓上蚤」之流，在衆目昭彰之下，很多俯首進行，大有些「有罪不敢抬頭」的光景。在旁邊監督的警探們看看自己勞苦的功績不壞，這次「起解」之後，連天辛苦已經齊時吿一段落，自然就不免有些洋洋得意的神氣。但是，突然之間生意興隆的地檢處裏的諸位先生，却是焦頭爛額，暗暗叫苦不迭呢！</p>
<p>「起解」分兩次舉行。第一次是上午十點，共有摸竊犯三百二十一人，有吉普卡和機器脚踏車前導，後面緊接保安警察一中隊，再後面就是車巡隊，然後就是「摸竊大隊」，三人一排，秩序極佳，而且步伐整齊非凡，同排三人中從沒有差差落落的現象—爲什麽呢？原來是有手銬相連的！</p>
<p>馬路兩旁的觀衆，眞是人山人海，有人說，「好看倒眞是好看的」就是少了一隊軍樂隊」。這一批不幸「失風」的人們，總算天幸，因爲剛剛趕到地檢處便下起雨來，還算免了一刦。</p>
<p>第二批是十一點鐘開始的，比較上沒有第一批的轟動全市，因爲祗有七十五個摸竊犯參加。他們運道不好，才走到林森路中段，便已經雷電交作，一塲傾盆大雨，「鼓上蚤」成爲「落湯鷄」了。</p>
<p>形形色色　蔚爲大觀</p>
<p>這次摸竊大隊共三百九十六人，分爲三個中隊。其中形形色色，蔚爲大觀，以衣服而論，有的衣冠楚楚，着實像是上流人物，大多却是衣衫襤褸，憔悴不堪。這三百九十六人中，有廿幾個還是小孩子，女的也有二十多個！</p>
<p>地檢處實在容納不下道許多突然光臨的「貴賓」。在無可奈何之中，他們祗得大開鐵門，迎接這浩浩萬蕩的三百九十六位好漢進去，把他們請到大堂歇脚。可是點名看人的時候却相常長，一直到黃昏，看看看守所裘早已有人滿爲患了，于是再來一次護送，把一大部份送到了提籃橋去　因爲提籃橋上海監獄裏的」房荒」問題，目前倒還不十分嚴重。</p>
<p>負責肅淸上海摸竊犯的，是警察局刑事警察處，由第二課課長酈俊厚主持，爲了辦理這次移解，他動員了二百五十位警探。昨天從一淸早八點鐘就開始工作，可是地檢處却因爲人手稍少，就不免忙得手脚無措了—地檢處之後還有地院，是不是還有一塲精彩表演在後面呢？</p>
<p>名目繁多　謹愼第一</p>
<p>警察局對摸竊的二十幾種名目和方法，都已調査得非常淸楚。因爲本報已迭有記載，所以除掉比較有興趣的幾種在下面略加說明外，其他就不預備詳述了。至於預防的方法，警察局寫了「謹愼第一」四個字，換句話說，還是：「衣帽物件，各自當心。」雖說是「沒有千年防賊」，常心一點倒底好得多。</p>
<p>觸天標：用竹桿一根上紥小鐵鈎，乘人不備之際，由陽台晒台或窗口伸入竊取衣着。</p>
<p>拍兩面光：又名塌燒餅，即敲玻璃窗，係用手帕或紙類先行貼在店面玻璃櫥窗上，然後擊破玻璃，使不發出聲響，實施偸　。</p>
<p>悶窰：每於夕陽西下，華燈初上之時，潛入商店住戶，先行躲藏，俟人熟睡後行竊。</p>
<p>落地爬：聚集三五人以上，在商店門外及埠頭車站等處，乘人不備，用假箱或假包裹套在他人物件上，竊之而去。</p>
<p>敲火油箱：三五人利用拉黃包車兜攬生意，當乘客坐上車墊時，以股懃手段接觸乘客衣袋，乘機摸竊，待得手後，借詞車胎走氣，或其他方法使乘客換車。</p>
<p>跑老戲：分平地，滾盤·菜戶·底子數種，即在路上或電車公共汽車菜塲上之摸竊，底子則在輸船上，摸竊方法係用刀片割袋，或用鐵鉗鉗取，或用剪刀剪破。</p>
<p>牽黃牛：利用同黨乘坐人力車至目的地，以付款爲由，使車大隨之他往時，由另一同黨竊其車而去。</p>

<h3>民政處解釋　戶籍法疑義</h3>
<p>本市民政處頃據第四區公所，爲發生戶籍法疑義三點，電請釋示，經分別核示如下：（一）戶籍法施行細則第十一條第二項規定，「戶內如有性質不同之戶附屬者，應依其性質分別立戶，」其解釋可參照本市戶籍登記處理規則第八條第二項，「如一戶在同一處所同一主管人之下，兼爲共同事業及共同生活者，一律視作共同事業戶」之規定。即非在同一處所，或非在同一主管人之下者，視爲附屬性質，應依其性質分別立戶。（二）納費請求閱覽戶籍登記簿或交付謄本，僅限利害關係人，律師代當事人向戶籍主任請求閱覽戶籍簿，或交付謄本，須出當事人之委託文書，仍應照繳閱覽費或抄　費。（三）閱覽費抄籍費數額過小，現正向中央一請求提高中，俟獲覆後，另令飭遵云。</p>
<h3>廿三區舉行　孕婦總登記</h3>
<p>第二十三區區公所，頃准吳淞衛生事務所函：以助產工作爲推行婦嬰衛生之重要部門、惟以鄉間一般之產婦，狃於積習，大都依賴不諳消毒手續之穩婆接生，致每年產婦死於非命，不知凡幾。近擬光行舉辦孕婦總登記，以便分別派員前往訪問檢騐，而利接產。該區現已通知各保，積極調査登記云。又該區（吳淞）第九保，以近來居戶激增，擬增編一甲爲第十一甲，遴派柏如福爲甲長，已呈請市府核備云。</p>
<h3>廿九區區長更調　總幹事周鐘科撤職</h3>
<p>本市第二十九區區長劉鼎，另有兼職，不常駐區辦公，曠廢職務，昨經市府免職，所遺職務並派由副區長朱幼谷暫行兼代。又該區公所總幹事周鍾科，謊報請假，逗留上海，市府昨將該員撤職，遺缺並派復員靑年軍施震霆接充云。</p>
<h3>四區攷核保幹事</h3>
<p>第四區公所，爲明瞭各保工作，加强保甲組織起見，曾於上月製定工作週報表，分發保幹事塡報，並將工作週報列爲攷勤之一。凡每次召開保幹事會議，如缺席一次者，予以申誡，缺席二次者，記過處分云。</p>

<h3>戶籍法規　疑義問答　（續）</h3>
<p>（五）統計類</p>
<p>問：婦女逃亡不知去向，統計時應列入何表？</p>
<p>答：統計遷徙人口時，列入遷出之口，仍保留其戶籍。</p>
<p>問：遷徙戶口統計，可否併入設籍除籍辦理？</p>
<p>答：性質不同，不能歸併。</p>
<p>問：可否將戶口統計報吿表（五）戶籍變更統計之轉籍登記一項，增爲轉入轉出兩項？</p>
<p>答：轉籍登記之轉入轉出，與設籍除籍不同前者係同時舉行，爲轉籍中之應經手續，而後者不能同時舉行，手續亦異，戶籍法中另有規定。旣辦轉籍之登記，仍須各別聲請，爲除籍設籍之登記，而戶口統計報告表（五）中所以列轉籍爲一欄者，係登記轉入轉出之總數，毋庸分爲兩欄。</p>

<h3>針織業困難太多　停工者佔三分之二　目前已入針織品旺銷期　該業亟謀找開本身出路</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃與針織業中人談該業近况，承吿：該業目前確處困難環境中，茲　其特殊困難言：（一）紡建公司配給紗綫，大小廠家一視同仁，致大型廠家，原料不敷時，只得仰州於黑市，生產成本又無形提高。（二）調整匯率後，開工生產各廠，反感困難。緣仰求黑市之紗綫，及其他原料如燒碱，顏料等，無不隨匯率調整，而吿漲價。而針織業之產品，大多維持原價。即有調整，至多不出一成。產品與原料價格之步漲，失部平衡。至一般之困難，如：（一）高利貸，最使該業感到威脅。蓄以該業情形而言，如利潤在一分半左右，已屬佼佼者。然現時暗息已與此項利潤不相上下。故如拆款經營，利潤所得，適抵息之支出。而一切開支，尙須倒貼。（二）工潮問題，在該業雖尙不致如他業之嚴重。但仍望工方體念時艱，充分發揮互助合作之精神。</p>
<p>據吿該業現加入公會之會員，共達六百十八家。此中用電動機者，僅一百另八家。其餘均屬手搖織機廠。故大型廠約佔全數四分之一。茲以上述種種困難之打擊，停工者達四百餘家之多。僅剩之二百餘家，大多亦處於半開工狀態中。眞能日日開工者，不過五十餘家。各廠之開工率，僅及戰前十分之二。開工率達十分之二以上者，已屬難能可貴。以產襪量言，戰前該業每日約可產襪十萬打，現則尙不足二萬打。惟亦因所產有限，故銷路尙佳。據談：目前已進入針織品之旺月，按例當供不應求。惟現以各地交通阻隔，外埠銷路，頗受影饗。南洋方面，經此次匯率調整後，外銷價格，雖略見起色；惟數量極少，且僅限小呂宋一地。其他地區，則因中英商約尙未具體決定，一時無法開展。</p>
<p>該業現正擬針對當前困難，覓求解決之方。將由該業公會通知所屬各會員：（一）協助政府穩定物價之決策，切實維持匯率調整前之原價。（二）聞同業中有以紡建所配得之棉紗棧單，轉手移讓，應切實查禁。在改善配紗辦法方面，將由該業公會就該業近况，擬一最近生產之狀况表。開明各廠機器件數，消費紗綫支數實况，以備爲紡建配貨時之參考，同時，尙望四聯總處，能予該業以合理之貸款。例如：貸款勿堅持以原料爲抵押品，而以各種地產，廠房，機器等替代，以蘇商艱。並望該處貸予款項時，能與各廠商直接洽談最佳，以免轉輾接洽，反滋流弊云。</p>
<h3>金價盤頭窄狹　美鈔交易不多</h3>
<p>烚赤昨初疲繼穩，客銷見殷有以致之，晨開二一四萬五，開後求供平衡，盤頭狹窄，曾自二一三萬五微升至二一五萬五，央行有所管制，逢被遏止，十時後央行以二一四萬二五之價配給一二〇條，此後又盤小至二一三萬五，始入盤途，終以閩汕客銷殷勤，買意不怠，午刻盤漲到二一六萬光景，午後逢週六無甚交易，結果較前收好起一萬四，飾金掛念二萬九，紋銀銀元均乏變化，暗拆息價自一角四至一角七不等。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔並無特變，美鈔自晨開三三九〇元起，中途始終屈居在三三八〇元前後盤旋·交易不多，午刻因余價報升，始微升至晨開價左右，午後仍乏變化，結果較前收升十元，港票略穩，結果較前收微升五元，港匯六九五元至七〇五元，印匯八四〇元至八五〇元，英匯一一二〇〇元至一一四〇〇元，美匯仍站牌價。</p>
<h3>公債交易轉盛</h3>
<p>公債昨稍盤好，交易較　，於是人心不免哄高，統丙晨開二五〇〇元，高價見二五七〇元，復有多頭來售，近午退至二三〇〇元結束，結果較前收升八十元，雜牌較有垂靑之人，均見向榮，計甲乙好一五〇元，丁種升一〇〇元，戊種祗好七十元，成交達票面六百萬元，人心對四聯建議存款加倍發還，觀感不一。</p>
<h3>秋銷發動　紗市堅穩</h3>
<p>昨日紗市堅穩如故，秋銷漸活，各帮均有買胃，以念支爲大宗，然現貨供應亦殺，故價僅好起一二萬元，設無禁運華南之政令，紗價必益見飛黃　達也，十六支及四十二支雙綫價與上日相仿，榮辱互見，人心安定，前途頗爲樂觀。</p>
<h3>人絲實銷不弱</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲上午略呈疲狀，一二〇號天橋做二百七十至七十二萬元，下午因實銷不弱，更因成交須隔日交款，故又喊高七八萬元，雜牌一二〇號金三馬有光，上午二百六十五萬元，下午二百七十萬元左右，半光上午二百卅萬元，下午三十五萬元，七五半光並無做開，廠經交易淸稀，喊價盤旋原價，綢貨頗形平穩，市價毫無變動。</p>
<h3>呢絨客銷激盛</h3>
<p>呢絨市面續趨活躍，川·湘·京杭各帮，均强力添辦，麥爾登大衣呢，草綠藏靑嘰嘰華達呢，西裝花呢，宣維，進胃均健，因秋節已過，中西呢料實銷激盛，各四服軍裝店舖，生意節節遞加，兼爲運輸關係，如再不採購裝運，貨物到銷時令有關，故冬季大衣呢類，今亦接踵採辦，交易因之更形鬧猛。</p>
<h3>交易稅暫不徵收　證交定明日開拍　佣金股票千分三公債千分二</h3>

<p>上海證券交易所昨日下午四時在證券大樓由杜鏞氏主持，召開第一届第二次理監事聯席會議，陳光甫，李馥蓀，錢新之，徐寄頃，徐維明等廿餘人均出席，由理事長等分別報吿，隨即討論，通過交易所組織大綱，並經決定九月十六日爲正式開拍日期，先做上午一市交易，其餘決定部份：（一）每經耙人規定營業員五人，（二）佣金問題，在經紀人公會未成立以前，暫由交易所假定之，包括經手費在內，股票公司價，佣金千分之三，（即萬分之卅）公債則爲千分之二，以上乃係向客戶收取者，（三）保證金代用品，由中央銀行指定銀行公布後，通函各經紀人。暫以書面擔保，一個月內掉換有價證券及地產，（四）交易稅暫不徵收，待當局通過公布後再施行，（五）電呈財經兩部，並分函交易所監理員，報吿開拍日期，至七時散會。另訊財部對於交易稅，前經規定爲萬分之十，現已由立法院修正爲萬分之五，歸賣方負擔。</p>

<p>華股亦轉向榮，冷門股更爲見秀，大都準備日內證交正式復拍時，逢高推出，搜求見殷，各股中途均見扳高，但高價時轉吿掙扎，臨收呈盤，結果較前收，計永紗美亞各漲少許，景福新光勤興各漲半成左右，較冷各股中型平穩，小型亦好起半成光景，元老股仍在原價，已核准上市之小股，以價賤吸引一般散戶跟從，見秀較多。</p>

<h3>秈米市價續跌　雜糧交易呆滯</h3>
<p>昨日米市消化仍呆到貨登記共九千餘石，南北市略有出入，北市埠秈新粳高貨竪挺，中關客秈仍疲而少交，新陰元繼續步跌四五千元，南市新百元新陰元亦小三四千元，秈米各貨均小千餘元，新粳彷彿，惟杜秈　秈南北市一律不振，麵粉店胃轉濃，略升百元，形居盤旋之局，　皮平平，小裘閩化淸淡，甬帮亦懈，北方不動，市面平庸，黃豆東北略有到貨，依然高定次滯，苞米靑島停辦，再低五六百元，芝蔴南洋停辦，本街交易寥寥，價格下挫一二千元，生仁廣方不納，再短一二千元，尙少交易，蠶豆仍趨疲勢，回軟三五百元，紅糧彷彿，油市供應見裕，回小千元，豆餅呆滯，步降二百元。</p>
<h3>存底豐厚　紙價難有起色</h3>
<p>據紙業中人稱：目前本市各種紙類存底頗豐，蘇聯報紙亦有大量流入，以致國產紙類銷路呆滯，紙價亦一蹶不振，短期內難望轉好，如經濟部管轄之江南，天章造紙廠，近來已减少報紙產量，現正改製連史紙及鈔票紙等，皆爲實銷不振之故，但美國最近會鬧紙荒，本市紙業已無再向美定購紙類，同時美方市價亦漲，不若向木市收購現貨較爲合算，據業中人觀察，全世界惟加拿大，瑞典，芬蘭等主要產紙區域，除自給外，尙可大量輸出，其他各國均須仰求外給，本市目前存紙雖豐，然經濟部所屬各廠，已擬定明年度將大量增產報紙之計劃云。</p>

<h3>每月需油三萬六千擔　各廠供給可達四萬擔</h3>
<p>本市食油，自成立審議會改訂供售辦法，市塲業已轉好，一週以來，菜油限價八萬六，豆油限價九萬三，始終維持不變，中國植物油廠所供售者，十三日已低於限價一千元，每祖爲八萬五，仍包送，僅生油略有黑市，限價九萬七千元，黑市十萬零一千元，此種現象，不難消滅，中國食油公司存油萬餘担，下週內即可交由中國植物油料廠代爲分配，每日爲一百桶，如中國植物油料廠，恢復按月供銷兩百桶之計劃，市價決不致再有增漲，本市每月需要量，不過三萬六千担，經審議會決定，中植廠每月供給一萬担，中食一萬担民營廠兩萬担，共計四萬担，供應市塲，尙有餘裕，市堪可穩定，決無間題。</p>

<h3>東北流通劵比值　暗盤較官價爲低　行轅經委會正商辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十四日電〕法幣與東北流通券之比値，官價仍爲十三對一，暗盤近來盤旋於十元零五及九元五換一元流通劵之間，此項暗盤操之於山海關數十錢攤兌換小販之手，現行轅經委會金融組正在詳商整定計劃，有人主張仍維持十三對一之比率，所持理由爲如兌換率官價變爲十二或十對一，則暗盤將變爲九或八對一亦未可知，如此變換，官方將轉爲被動地位矣。最好由中行在楡設處，大量兌換，爭取主動，另一部份人則主張，按照實際情形訂定，因此項問題關係關內外匯兌公務人員匯寄贍家費及物價甚鉅，放極爲一般人士所注目。</p>
<h3>中國之進出口情形　美啊業家表示驚異　工業原料價二三倍於美國　原料出口而向外紛定製品</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十三日電〕據美國權威製造廠家稱，雖然中國之商業情况迄未安定，但輸往中國之工業化學原料可望賡續增進，現由中國前來之訂貨，源源不絕，因到貨太多，高貨價已起反動，如三百公斤桶裝燒碱，其售便相當於美金七八〇元，然而上海之市價，大抵仍較美國高出二倍或三倍，不過有部分中國商人，曾被迫將彼等之存貨出售，其價格竟低於成本，或甚至無利可圖，刻有重碳酸納二·〇〇〇噸業運抵或正在駛往上海途中，其一百磅袋裝之價格，業已由美金六〇元跌至一四元，然需求仍呈現極端活躍。中國雖然有其自設之硫酸廠，但新近此間仍接有四〇噸硫酸訂貨一批，其餘函電馳詢者計有單寗酸，而其原料之五掊于，過去在中國出口貨中，固佔有電要位置也。</p>

<h3>考試制度與建國</h3>
<p>— 成惕軒</p>
<p>自考試院成立迄今，巳有將近十八年的歷史。在這十八年當中，大局經歷過無數的風波，國家遭受了空前的災難，瘡痍滿目，百度維艱，然而者政當局，過去於戎馬倉皇之際，尙能舉行掄才大典，爲國家拔取賢能，現在進人和平建國時期，凡百建設，在在需才，實更有加强考試制度之必要。其理由，則如（一）適應建國工作的需要，（二）達成萬能政府的目的，（三）免除政黨政治的動盪不安等等，實已無待詳述。現在，請略陳我對考政當局的幾點切望：</p>
<p>（一）量的配合人，時，地，事，物互相配合，纔易獲得成功，這是主席指示我們的辦事方法。如將他的範圍擴而大之，則全國大小各機關，分佈何地？需用何人？所司何事？應備何物？都應具有一個精確的統計。因爲有了精確的統計，纔能談到適當的配合；而負全國整個人事的配合之責者，應該就是中樞裏面的考政機關。因此，我覺得考政當局，最好先對全國各機關（包括中央與地方），舉辦一次人車總調査，調査確實之後，隨時注意它的動態登記，雖無具體的職位分類，可資依據，但總可統計其中擔任高級職務者幾何人，擔任低級幹部者又幾何人；屬於普通行政性質者若干人，屬於傳門技術方面者又若干人；平均每年死亡之人數爲幾何？每年退休與轉業之人數又爲幾何？這樣一一的標示出來，　便可明瞭國家整個人事的全貌·一方面即可知道何項人才最感缺乏，何項人才亟待補充，作爲舉行各類考試時的參考；另一方面，亦可利角臨時抽考和定期考績的方法，汰除那些不合標準的人員，予考試及格者以逐漸推廣之路。照這樣的逐漸推廣下去，必可使考試與任用的關係互相連繫起來，慢慢達到雙方數量上的一致。</p>
<p>（二）實的提高時代的進步，實在日新月異之中？「幕友」組織與「官僚」作風，已不適用於民主和科學時代。今日必須多才多能之士，始足以管理衆人，擔當國事。考試的作用，即在如何汰除庸劣，拔眞才，以爲國家服務。如果懸格太低，勢將聞茸並登，失却取士官人之旨。不過提高官吏素質的方法，最好是分頭進行，從根做起。即一方面應田考政機關與主管敎育的機關，經當取得密切的聯擊。蓋考試在得人才，而人才出自學校，沒有良好的敎育，那有優秀的人才？旣乏人才，何從考試！抗戰以還，由於戰時情緒的不安”物質條件的不够，敎育水準不免稍稍降低；今後應如何力圖補救，俾在校的靑年學子，個個都成國家有用之才，實在値得考政與敎育當局的共同注意。其次即在考政機關於舉行各類考試之時。確立客觀標準，取錄務從嚴格，寗缺毋濫，蜜精毋多，寗過毋不及。如果能照這樣做去，我想官吏的素質，必可一天天的提高，同時，考試的功用，亦將一天天的更加顯著了。</p>
<p>（三）任用審査權的强化　居今日而欲各機關的人事進退，悉出考試之一途，幾乎是不可能的事。因爲：（一）中國雖然老早就有了考試制度，但每逢衰亂之世，法度廢弛，用人祇重私情，沒有守法的精神和習慣。所謂「一人得道，雞犬升天」，這種作風，依然有殘餘的存在。（二）一班無行的士人，皆視做官爲護符，發財爲目的。往往爲利祿之心所驟使，奔走種門，恬不知恥，而捨考試之正路不由。（三）國民政府成立，不到二十年的時間。創業之秋，羣流並進，多不屬於攷試的範圍；且有所謂「保薦」之法，「破格」之議，官人多方，初不以攷試爲限。但是現實儘管如此，我們當不以現實爲滿足，而思所以改善之方。所謂改善之方，可分兩方面來講：即一方面對於公務員任用法，雨加修訂，使其縮减資格的條款，注重考試的精神；另一有力和有效的管制，則爲任用審査權之强化。各機關登用新進人員，例須經過送審的階段，銓叙部旣司任用審査之大柄，即當以是爲人才陞黜之機，其有不合標準與規定者，應即屛而不用，以待攷試及格的賢能。這樣一來，不獨可以樹立攷試的權威，而攷試及格人員，當亦不致再感分發的困難和升遷的不易了。</p>
<p>以上三點，爲對攷政局的　　之獻。最後，我想一述對於攷試及格人員之希望。</p>
<p>（甲）要有成績表現　一般攷試及格人員，初任機關工作，其取得長官信任與同僚愛護者，固不乏人；而置之散地，視若閒曹，亦比比皆是。夷攷其故不是藉口攷試及格人員的能力並不較之术受攷試者爲僵，就是稅他的經騐如何缺乏等等。我想一個願意參加攷試而且攷試曾經及格的人，他的能力不會壞到那裏，也許用得不適其所，致令他的能力無處發舒，甚至浪費。但無論如何，我總希望攷試及格的同志，一定要自强不息，貞固不移，克服一切的困難，表現自已的能力，以成績來顯示攷試制度的價値與尊嚴，更以成績來消滅可長的人言，爭取合法的保障。</p>
<p>（乙）要有學習精神攷試次格同志，除了若十年事較長洞明世故的人士之外，誠然有的經騐不够，不免遭受社會的批評。但人才以歴練而成，經騐以積累而得，世界上沒有那一個人是生來就有經騐的，祗要你肯虛心，你肯學習，又能鍥而不舍，持之以恒，則事無巨細，必有計日程功駕就熟之一日。</p>
<p>主席提倡「機關學校化」運動，即在寓敎導於工作之中，使一些年靑的公務人員，得向老成練達的長官和同僚，有所觀摩，有所請益。因此，我願攷試及格的同志，隨時隨地，都要抱着一種謙遜的態度和學習的精神。有了這種學習的精神，然後纔不致於「故步自封」，而能獲得經常不斷的進涉。</p>
<p>（丙）要有國士觀念這裏所指的國士，和過去豫讓所標舉的國士不同。讓謂「中行以衆人待我，我故以衆人報之；智伯以國土待我，我固以國土報之，」那祗是出自一念之私，僅以個人爲對象，而不以國家爲對象。我認爲國土的意義，應該是才堪治國者，方得謂之國土；同時，國士要爲國效忠，一切知有公而不知有私，纔是名符其實。攷試及格的同志，旣係國家選拔的賢能，當不失爲才堪治國之士，所以，必須發揮愛國和救國的熱誠，竭盡所能，以圖報稱，無論對人對事，祗有「公是公非」，絕對不要因爲個人的恩怨，局部的利害，一時的愛憎和毀譽，遂假公以濟私，或厚彼而薄此。這個新的國士觀念，我願一般攷試及格同志，能够率先的培養起來，以爲那些値黨營私者勸。</p>
<p>際此國家建設積極需才之日，又値攷政學會舉行年會之時僅貢狂愚，以當芹曝。（卅五，九，十二，於南京）</p>

<p>流亡女生呼籲助學</p>
<p>編輯先生：我是蘇北流亡出來的靑年學生之一，（第二臨中初中舉業）且正在求學之際，但是因了經濟的關係，而不能如願，前閱報載，得悉蘇北難民救濟會，曾有一萬萬元，分配給蘇北流亡學生，於是重欲入學之希望着復燃，當即投函該會，請予接濟，且附有本人流亡登記之號碼，證明確係流亡學生，不意自該信發出後，竟如石沉大海，杳無音信，而本人已考入私立培明女中高一。該校學膳雜費甚貴，家庭實無力負擔，所企待者，即等待救濟會給予一筆救濟金，現今滬市舉行各種募捐方式所得之救濟金，何止億萬，而對於蘇北流亡的學生，不能有助，深爲感　！蘇北流亡學生與我同病者甚多，本百年樹人之旨，謹向當局呼籲，請將救濟蘇北流亡學生的這一筆巨款，分配一點給無家可歸，考入學校而不得入學的學生則有生之年皆感德之日矣，並祈作普遍的調查，勿使遺漏，則更爲感激了。（紀與）</p>
<p>請設立工程夜學</p>
<p>編輯先生：讀了貴報十八日的社論，一方面覺得很欽佩，在另一方面牠勾起了我的心事</p>
<p>我是一個高中畢業生，畢業後，因爲經濟和其他的原因，不得不放棄升學的願望而進入就業之一途。兩年來，利用餘暇，讀一些科學方面的雜誌，溫溫舊日的數理敎本，也曾自修完一本微積學，可是這種事倍功半的自修，不能滿足我的求知慾，於是我就想起半工半讀的辦法來。可是失望得很，現有的大學裏，祇有滬江有夜班是商學院，也有一個工業夜校，二個月就招生一次，其餘的都是些補習學校之類，可就沒有一個好好的工程夜校。我相信：在這個都市裏，一定有不少有志於工業的靑年過着像我一樣的生活，要滿足求知慾而不得，正期待着一所工程夜大學的出現。（如前雷士德工業專門夜校）（張遴一）</p>
<p>鐵廠學徒無力求醫</p>
<p>編者先生：我是鐵廠裏的一個小學徒，六日下午，忽因不愼而致手指軋破，乃即自投「勞工醫院」求治。不料該院掛號處職員要掛號金二千元，這就是我半個月的月規錢，而葉費尙無着着落？因此即回廠中，聽其自然。團憶上次醫　脚之時，見內中有一匾額，上題「惠我勞工」四字，我想今後趨要做到這個「惠」字才好！（小學徒）</p>
<p>女金大招生未徇情</p>
<p>金陵女子文理學院招生委員會函（上略）查本校招生，一秉至公，幷無徇私及說情事項。此次在滬招考，報名者達三萬餘人，結果僅錄取正取生六十餘名，備取生廿餘名，以名額有限，致一般落第者不無怨言。又此次進德女中報考者共六名，結果僅錄取一名，足見對進德考生幷無優待。即本校附中畢業生進升大學者，亦須參加同樣入學考試，並無特別優待。此種事實俱在，諒爲各界所共知，故投稿者所云非實情也。（下略）</p>
<p>都市醫院能進麼</p>
<p>編者先生：鄙人剛自靑島來滬，因孩子患神經病，經友人介紹王醫師處醫治，乃於昨晚進富民路上某醫院，今午携兒出院，事實上進院僅一天，面算賬却以二天計，共計十一萬元。鄙人昨日進院時，曾付過五萬元，蒙减去四萬，尙欠二萬餘，只得將手上僅有之金戒兌換付淸，方才出院。而回顧孩子，病勢依然如昨，並未减去分毫。嗚呼！大都市的醫院，大都市的醫生，大醫院大醫生的醫德！（王琦）</p>
<p>醫院服務部取費貴</p>
<p>編者先生：鄙人因身弱多病，故於上月三十日，往中美醫院檢査體格，需款三萬元，鄙人聞該院設有社會服務部，專爲貧民服務，而取費如此之貴，未免有背服務之旨。（林鳳安）</p>

<h3>答復讀者　法律質疑</h3>
<p>（一）被迫出盤</p>
<p>趙開甲問　某甲於廿八年在某地開設旋社，自任經理，後因某乙垂涎串同敵憲將甲拘捕，指爲聯絡中央人員，欲陷於罪，嗣經人多方調停，乙聲言非以接盤旅社爲釋甲之條件不可。甲當時忍痛出盤，勝利後乙潛逃無談，該旅社爲縣府査封，最近乙又利用其惡勢力挽人向縣府疏通啓封，聞縣府業已照准，甲雖據理控訴，迄未生效，請問：（一）用何種手續，向乙追回原產？（二）此案可否向乙直接交涉？（三）證據方面現祗有廿八年至卅二年之賬簿，股單等已爲乙攫去，此對將來訴訟上有無關係？</p>
<p>〔秦聯奎律師答〕某甲所開之旅社，如確係某乙串同敵憲將甲拘捕欲加陷害，乙聲言以接盤旅社爲釋甲條件，甲乃忍痛出盤，是其出盤之表示，由於被迫，依民法第九十二條之規定，甲得撤銷其表示。但民法九十三條有前條之撤銷，應於發見詐欺或脅迫終止後一年內爲之之規定。又復負後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第七條規定，民法或其地法律所定行方權利之期間，如因戰事不能遵守者，於本條例施行後二年內仍得行使其權利。但其原定期間短於二年者，僅得於本條例施行後六個月內行使之。此項補充條例，係民國三十四年十二月十八日公布施行，至本年六月十八日已經期滿，但如縣政府之發封係據甲之對乙訴訟，且時在本年六月十八日以前，則可認甲己有撤銷行爲，茲並就列舉問題，分列答覆如下：（一）在法定期間內用訴訟或交涉手續均可。（二）民法第九十二條之撤銷原係直接交涉，但應於法定期間內爲之。（三）證據方面重在證明強迫。</p>
<p>（二）抵押借款</p>
<p>洪棟齡問　民廿五年，舍親某因無本經商向家母商借，適無現款在手，遂以先父遺產房屋一幢，向某甲抵押得款七百元，約定三年爲期，約滿歸某甲自行處置，並自即日起由某甲收租抵息，該約由家母及內人簽字，家岳爲保證人，未經本人簽字及同意，現家母及內人己先後亡故，請問：（一）該約是否繼續有效？（二）敝人爲遵從家母遺囑，擬以二百倍償還，而某甲堅持非五百倍不可，不知是項契的可否向地政局掛失而予以否認？（三）如該約爲合法，則取贖手續如何？</p>
<p>〔奏聯奎律師答〕（一）母以成年之子所繼承之父遺不動產，或與其千共同繼承之父遺不動產，未得子之同意，擅行出抵，其成年之子自得否認其抵押權，但母所借得之款，母死亡後子應負淸償之責。（二）償還債務之增加給付，現行法係由法院公平裁量，無其他標準。爲免訴訟之緊，似以和解爲善，關於收回契據，如和解不成，可於訴請否認抵押權時併案辦理。倘飾稱遺失，則與事實不符，至捐助慈善與否，亦與收回契據無涉。（三—）參閱（一）（二）解答，即可明瞭。</p>

<h3>戲劇敎育</h3>
<p>— 向培良</p>
<p>因爲戲劇表演，本身已經具有若十敎育的意義，所以戲劇敎育便被人誤解。以爲祇要所演的劇本，內容或主題是含有道德意味的，便可以稱爲敎育的戲劇，其實這種看法，並不足以正確說明戲劇敎育的意義。</p>
<p>這種說法，是就戲劇表演對觀眾（卽藝術的鑒賞者）的效果而言。則這種表演必須是成熟的藝術活動，於是學生和兒童的演劇便會遭屛斥。事實上，藝術敎育最活動的園地是中小學校。其次，嚴格說來，任何藝術品都是道德的，戲劇尤甚。所以像奧迭浦斯王，幽麗女士，莎樂美之類，都是道德的，更無論其他。當然，我們可以把那些道德意識顯明的稱之爲敎育的戲劇，不過這不是戲劇敎育主要的部份。</p>
<p>藝術敎育中的音樂美術等都是從藝術活動的本身（創作）去敎育兒童，所以戲劇敎育也必然是從戲劇活動的本身去敎育兒童，一次表演的全部過程，所包含的活動方面至廣，簡直是具體而徵的全部人生社會，所以戲劇敎育的施敎範圍極廣。又因爲人體的動作是最基本的活動，其影響心靈的力量極深；所以戲劇敎育的施敎效力將極大。</p>
<p>現在再以解釋戲劇敎育如下：戲劇敎育是藝術敎育的一種，其活動範圍主要地在中小學校，以靑年及兒童爲對象。戲劇敎育是藉戲劇活動（主要地是表演），也就是創作的行爲來施敎，至於藉演劇以敎育觀象的方式，雖然也是戲劇敎育的一部份。但因爲這是古今中外久已實行着的，所以不成爲今日硏究戲劇敎育的重要對象。</p>
<h3>勇敢地愛吧！　讀「柔密毆與幽麗葉」</h3>
<p>— 陶熊</p>
<p>偉大的莎士比亞給我們留下了「柔密歐與幽麗葉」。讓我們知道了：「靑春容易消逝」和「愛情的神聖，崇高和偉大」。</p>
<p>這一對代表着青春和愛情的人物；柔密歐和幽麗葉。雖然是仇恨和障礙　在他們的前面，也阻止不了他們的結合。</p>
<p>純潔的愛情永遠是追隨着青春的。有祟高的感情和純潔的心靈，才能得到眞正的愛情。</p>
<p>人的一生，靑春只是佔着短短的幾年。當愛神的前發出的時候，你不要躱避！</p>
<p>柔密歐和幽麗葉。他們不管兩家的仇恨，也不管眼前的阻礙，更不管將來的悲哀；緊緊地抓住青春，大膽地愛戀著。他們才是一對真正懂得人生的人！</p>
<p>可惡的是固執的家長，强迫着自已的兒女去和一個不被人愛的人結婚。這些頑固的家長殺死了多少可愛的年輕人的靑春和生命。摧殘了多少愛人們的愛情，蹂躪了多少愛人們的意志！直到現在，這種無理的要求還是存在着。意志不堅定的。性格柔弱的兒女們，還是在做着祭台上的羔羊！年輕的人們、應該從祭台上解放下來！反抗頑固的家長！破除封建的餘孽，逃出牢籠，走向自由天地去！爲前途的幸福着想</p>
<p>要不是老凱布逼迫着可愛的幽麗葉，她何至於用死來掩飾她的不願！要不是老凱布强佔幽麗葉的意志，怎麼會促使他們這一對可愛的靑春入物，在愛情的火焰中焚毀！</p>
<p>人，一生下地來，己經決定了他奴隸的命運！他們只要是人就逃不了這殘酷的決定。他無法像主似地不受任何事物的管東，不受任何事物的牽制，不被任何事物所控制地生活着。他將像個奴隸似地服從着他自已的命運！這些不同命運的奴隸們！當你打沒有愛的時候，你還留戀這世界上的什麼？</p>
<p>上帝創造了人類：賜予生命和愛情；若是上帝將愛情收回，只留下生命給人，人類活着就沒有了溫暖。這，跟活動的泥塑木難有什麼兩樣！</p>
<p>當你沒有了愛的時候，或是你的愛被拒絕之後，你會感到人生沒有興趣，對前途失望！你就會恨，恨你自己爲什麽要生在這世界上！</p>
<p>自從有文化以後，多少偉大的文學家和藝術家在描寫着人間的愛！一直到現在，從沒有中斷過。最偉大的莎士比亞的「柔密歐與幽麗葉」，非但吿訴了我們愛情的神聖和崇高，並且還吿訴了我們：青春是這樣的容易消逝</p>
<p>年靑的柔密歐和幽麗葉們，緊緊地抓住你們的靑春，不要讓它偸偸地溜走！當愛神降臨的時候，你就勇敢地愛吧！不要辜負了上帝賜給你的生命和愛情！</p>
<h3>蘇北話</h3>
<p>— 迂</p>
<p>蘇北同鄕會爲了「忠義之家」中的小漢奸講蘇北話，認爲有意侮辱蘇北同胞。其實他講那個地方的話。你不能不算他是中國人。假使因爲他講了中國話，引起全中國同胞的抗議。……</p>
<p>這使藝術工作者也太難了。</p>
<p>新歌星凱塞葛玲蘆遜與海佛林在民「七情花」中</p>
<h3>七情花</h3>
<p>— 琳</p>
<p>柏士德納克是一手創造了狄安娜竇萍的電影監製人，幾乎沒有一張狄安娜的歌唱片不是他的傑作。現在他加入了米高美。「七情花」便是他在米高美監製的第一片。</p>
<p>「七情花」是張音樂片，寫美國密歐根一個小村鎭上開着一家旅舍的七個姊妹——七位漂亮的Miss。那村上一直保特着荷蘭移民遺留下來的習俗，每年一度舉行Tulip　Festival（鬱金香節）。</p>
<p>凱來琳·格雷遜是旅舍主人的最小女兒，她在遍野錦繡的花的季節中，跟跑來採　花節新聞的一個記署愛上了。故事是平易面溫婉的，沒有驚駭險惡的塲面，沒有裏哀憂傷的氣息。只是淡淡的人情味，混混雜着淡淡的笑，美我的鄕村背景、點綴着格雷遜柔美的歌。</p>
<p>格雷遜有着極婉轉動聽的歌喉，（當然也很美麗）。據親這位小姐與米高美簽訂合同以後，曾受很嚴格的聲樂訓練，同時學着其他化粧，美容，表情等等藝術。所以格雷遜代表着好萊塢的新的一羣，是受過新式的專門訓練的所謂「明日的影星」。</p>
<p>我們因此可以很胆大的說：柏士德納克是在創造第二個狄安娜竇萍了。</p>
<h3>化裝與色彩</h3>
<p>— 文泉</p>
<p>化裝爲完成演員飾演人物外形表現中的一部必需手續與工作。爲演員全部藝術創造過程中最先假設，最先完成的創作之一。無論在任何演出情况之下，它都必須完滿達成其目的。在近代劇院之高度裝置燈光與彩的運用之下，化裝亦必須在完備的材料之下精細實施。相反若在鄕村廣塲露天演劇，化裝之方法自應轉變爲簡明誇張的手法。古希臘羅馬演劇時之便用面具，亦即在適應廣大觀衆的需要而極度誇張。</p>
<p>化裝在演員藝術中，是人物的舞臺形象靜止的一部份，其表現是非瞬間的，不連續的。及其變動，亦必待幕間時須完成、故必須有以不變應萬變的知識去處理，能配合各種色光與情緒之統一與生動。</p>
<p>化裝除上述不同於演技以外，其材料亦取之於演員本身以外，因此當爲一般演員忽視爲不屬於其本身藝術之一部，同時爲了重視自已歪曲的明星身份，常常要求化裝管理者替他化裝（如果只是要求某一部份在技術上的帮助自另作別論），試問自已所最熟習的角色，反要人家替你配以形貌，這種　肉不統一的事實能促使你藝術的完成嗎？</p>
<p>化裝的表現結果，雖然是包含着實施者底技術的因素，但決不能使此技術成爲機械地面譜式的習慣。近代劇化裝的要求，正跟劇本取之於廣泛的人生一樣—各種族，各階層，與不同知識，不同年齡，不同個性。同時，得根據各劇演出類型而增减其寫實成份。如中國抽象式的舊劇，若你廢除了面譜而代替以寫實化裝，亦能破壞其統一，相反應用於一切戲劇，均將淪爲非驢非馬，不成其爲藝術。</p>
<p>一切色均源於光，前曾一再提及，且光色與染色，及色與色對比的顯現問題，亦曾分別述及。故完備化裝室中有各色燈之裝備，亦正要求演員進一步對色彩學有極正確的了解。對各劇所採舞臺色光的運用，有詳細的紀錄。然後以這詳細的紀錄配合有色的油彩去化裝，才能給觀衆以正確的效果。換言之：「有色油彩配以準備的舞臺色光，才是眞正的化裝色彩。」以這種色彩去化裝，才能得到正確的效果。</p>
<h3>關於春寒</h3>
<p>— 劉宇</p>
<p>最近在蘭心大戲院上演的「春寒」。劇本的主題恰恰和易卜生的「國民公敵」沒有兩樣。「春寒」裏的主角老醫生，是一個勇於挺身而出，不顧一切社會惡勢力的障碍，而處處爲正義呼籲，爲公衆謀幸福的人。他爲了大衆的健康，去進行蓄水池的　水工作，他不辭勞苦，不爲個人的利益，即使在孤獨得幾乎可以倒坍下來的時候，他還是挺直胸脯，要貫澈自已的主張，要實現自己的理想。任何人在經過無教次的挫折以後，都可以看風轉舵，把自已改變過來，然而這位老醫生却不爲任何的惡勢力所動搖，他甚謝還在最後咬緊了牙關，宣佈他和惡勢力的戰鬥的秘訣：「要打在它的要害裏！」</p>
<p>易卜生的「國民公敵」，也是描寫到永和細菌的問題；在「國民公敵」裏，也創造了一個和社會惡勢力搏擊底的戰鬥的性格。</p>
<p>所以我們不能不說，「春寒」的作者是受到子易卜生的影饗但易卜生的「國民公敵」，是發表在一千八百八十二年，而「春寒」的誕生，是在相隔半個低紀以上的現在，於此可見，一部偉大巨著的所以具有永久性的價値，是在它的能够發掘和提煉眞理的法則——這種眞理的法則，便是文藝創作的主題，也便是一部作品的實質和骨骼。</p>
<h3>一週電影短評</h3>
<p>— 祝西</p>
<p>本週電影賣座狀况還是同上週一樣：以「出水芙蓉」同國片「忠義之家」最好。每天四塲，塲場客滿。</p>
<p>出水芙蓉</p>
<p>該片開塲甚佳，雷特史基爾頓比伊漱蕙琳絲活潑多多。全片編不及導，導不及演。</p>
<p>直搗東京</p>
<p>主題是嚴肅的，約翰迦斐爾登陸工作一段未有特出，是該劇的失敗處，取去定時炸彈一段甚佳。</p>
<p>瘋在藝人</p>
<p>依照劇情，導演應該很可以討好，但是結果是功虧一簣，以致有好幾處很可討好的地位缺少一口氣、像結束的一段便是一例</p>
<p>殺林達黛妮兒的一塲，很乾凈。</p>
<p>林達黛妮兒戲不多，因這類角色本易討好，故不能說有成功，主角賴特克里格亦僅稱職已上而已喬治山德士的角色寫的也不够，演的也太簡單。</p>
<p>偵探小姐</p>
<p>導演以車內，車站，打電話報警三部曲介紹狄安娜竇萍，不壞。歹人盜回睡鞋的一段，要鏡頭極佳，鏡頭自狄安娜唱歌時的身邊移出，兜過花園而至室外歹人的背後，此一段雖未見狄安娜其人？但却以其人爲中心。</p>
<p>諜網情鴛</p>
<p>故事雖屬於鬧劇，但亦欠嚴密；桃樂賽拉摩一角在後部似乎與前部不曾有好焊接。全片的成績不及先前映過的「止鵝諜影」</p>
<p>鮑勃霍拍仍很圓活，挑樂賽拉摩則呆板，如果單抱一個目的——解悶——那它還是一部不錯的片子。</p>
<p>演員</p>
<p>（一）雷特史基爾頓，在「出水芙蓉」中</p>
<p>（二）愛德華霍頓，在「偵探小姐」中</p>
<p>（三）賴特克里格，在「瘋狂藝人」中</p>
<h3>顧仲彝講　戲劇結構</h3>
<p>— 陳默</p>
<p>結構是戲劇的靈魂。結構就是用經濟的手段，巧妙的方法，來把握觀衆，不讓他們有一點　懈的機會，直到終塲。戲劇的結構，是一種極嚴密的組織方式。結構一部份固然要靠天才，一部份也要靠訓練。要談戲劇的結構，第一要硏究戲劇的中心，戲劇的中心不在人物而在動作。戲劇裏面沒有一個無關的人，一件無關的事，一句無關的話。沒有高潮的戲劇，就是平淡的戲劇。</p>
<p>戲的結構主要分三部：開始，發展，結尾。任何戲的開塲，一定要引起觀眾的注意，好奇心，疑慮，同情或反感，還應有伏筆。發展是根據開塲裏邊所提示出的事實來完成的。把那裏面所提供出來的間題加以發揮，戲的主要效果就在這一塲。要使襯劇中的動作能得到充分的具體的分揮，同時又能保持觀衆的興趣，一定要使那悲劇中的動作，在複雜錯綜裏發展出，在連續的危機中展示出。危機，是一劇發展中的情緒的焦點，就是那些含有一種情緒上的衝突之情勢。戲的收塲首先求其明確。不能使觀衆有一點疑慮。從劇中動作的發展上，從觀衆的心理學者來，都應合理。但收塲也不宜過急。</p>
<p>亞里斯多德說：「結構包括三點：（一）戲的長短。戲不能太長，也不能太短。在一個時問內，把一簇整個的戲很完美一地表演出來，時間是兩點鐘到三點鐘。（二）結構：分三點：A開端，B中間、C結尾。開端必然引起複雜勢情的發生。發展必然依靠因果律的連一續展示。結尾是全劇的總結。而因果關係最忌怕有兩點：（一）巧合，（二）不相關連。</p>
<p>戲的結構從希臘到現在分兩大派：（一）是古典派方法。講究三一律時間，地點，動作三者一致。（二）是浪漫派方法。不顧慮一切的限制。</p>
<p>古典派賴完整，緊凑，氣氛統一。而害處在範圍太小；容易牽强，做作，人物性格的發展大受限制，甚至沒有發展。</p>
<p>浪漫派挑選戲劇性的塲面範圍大，內容較充實，人物個性有盡量發展的機會。而壞處在結構容易鬆馳，不够緊凑，沒有一個完整的氣氛與情緒。</p>
<p>這兩種方法，各有長短，視題材與作者的興趣來決定方法的取捨。</p>
<p>普通古典派寫法拿希臘悲劇作藍本，浪漫派寫法拿莎士比亞劇本作示範。</p>
<p>在戲劇的結構裏邊，運用兩種方法最有成效，也最能抓住觀衆的情緒，直至劇終。</p>
<p>一是「期待」。就是戲中最主要的危機或動作的主潮，像波浪似的一波未平，一波又起，使觀眾的情緒捲進一子劇情的洪潮，一顆期待的心期冀着這危機的如何解脫，如何終結，直到劇終，觀衆所期待的問題始得明暸。</p>
<p>二是「相反」危機到臨，爲觀衆發覺，而劇中人不知道，戲的結果，與觀衆所希望的相反。劇中人不知道自已走錯了路，一步一步接近失敗，死亡，直到他認識淸楚了自已的處境，已不可挽團了，但是他的危機始終被觀衆看得非常淸楚，而深深地替他擔心着，期　着，但是眼看着他與觀衆所希望的走着相反的路，直到滅亡！</p>

<h3>發明和創造</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>科學的發明，和藝術的創造，給人類以物質和精神上的幸福，揮發人生真善美崇高的意義，威廉哈羅William　Harvey　一千三百年來的舊說，創立了十七世紀醫學史上最光榮的紀錄。</p>
<p>天才作家文西Leonard　de　Vinc，根據解剖學的研究，在四百五十年前，證明了人類也能利用科學方法，像飛鳥一樣在空中翱翔，當時受人們的議評和恥笑，幸而靠他卓越的繪書天才，完成了「莫那里沙」，和「最後晚餐」的傑作光芒萬丈，暗淡他在科學和醫學上的成就。</p>
<p>惲壽平和王石谷，齊名當世，惲氏恥為中國第二，放棄山水，專攻花鳥，為東方藝壇放一異彩，石濤論盡，「古人未立法之先，不知古人法向法，古人既交法之後，不許今人出古法，千百年來，遂使今人不能一出頭地也，冤哉。」這種創造的精神，是藝人的瓖實。</p>
<p>孔子說了一名客氣話，「述而本作一信好古，」被懶惰的國人誤解，拿因製模仿一來代規了發明和創造，影響到中國整個學術的進步。</p>
<p>法西斯主義倒了，德國和意大利總崩潰，當年希特勒排猶，愛因斯坦教授，迄今被美國禮聘在最高學府請學。</p>
<p>創造和平幸福的科學和藝術，是不受時間和空間的控制，超越了任何時代和民族，他要灌輸新生的血液，滲透全人類的心靈。</p>
<h3>“石濤書語錄”探窺　（下）</h3>
<p>— 鄭為</p>
<p>從這幾節文字，我們知道石濤的「筆墨」，是由「受任」上來的，這受任的理論，一如老荘相應，無為，的學說。衹要有他處處着重筆墨的濃淡，腕虛，空妙，便出於「穎脫」（即老子虛其心，實其腹，弱其志，強其骨），以中「無為而有為，不化而應化」的至理。如是，才後能盡筆墨之用，一天任之全。做到「受事則無形，洽形則無跡」「運峯如已成，操筆如無為，尺幅管天地，山川，萬物，而心淡者無。」亦荘坐庖丁解牛，郢人運斤的真意。老子所謂「善行者，無轍跡」。其實這些都是規矩，最高明的法則。所以我們要說石濤是有法有規矩的話，那末，就應該屬於這一類，其實，能令衆生所龐受的藝術家，他本身一定是些最懂得「法」同「規矩」的生活者。</p>
<p>「如何得到這一法」同「規矩」？這須要談到「二書」，也就牽涉到石濤藝術意境淵源的問題了。為了想明白一書，所以先談談一書的來源，翻到書語錄第一章：</p>
<p>「太古無法，太樸不散，太樸一散，而法立矣，法於何立，立於一書，一書者；衆有之本，萬象之根」。</p>
<p>石濤藝術意境之誔生，這幾句話可以慨括的，宇宙萬物的淵源，也僅令這幾句話可以概括。這當然應該說是石濤自我的心眼在宇宙攝取。但我還要說他借了一個龐大的背景；東方　糧的代表上道家的思想。來資助孵化的。老子二十八章：</p>
<p>「樸散則為器」。再四十二章：</p>
<p>「道生一，一生二，二生三　三生萬物」。</p>
<p>太樸是渾全的，但不是沒有生用，有生用，也必定有分佈的作用，故散而為器（器指用言，就是老子所謂一生二，一是指這本有的「同」，赤道之所達所歸之主）中庸：「其為特不貳，則生物不測」（感此應彼，而成相得之用，故聖人拖一而為天下式）。這裏，可以知道這個「一」，這個「同」，　在宇宙間的重要，「道一就要藉他來發現所有的「異」。石屬於此有甚深的理解，但為着他立場在書，所以用「一書」的「明」，來通達所有的「異」。成就了英書的「變」。再有，資任章所說：</p>
<p>「任不在廣，任其可制」</p>
<p>「制」，裁也，因同襲明，都是出發在他渾全無割的宇宙觀。雖然　一書的理在渾全的太樸，但一書之法，郤「藏用於人」，這就是上面已經提到石濤所以發現了一個「我」，何等高明的目覺。「我」乃出之於對事物之同情。（印度科學家泰戈爾一九二六年在印度Bengal的笛卡夫學Deccan　講的藝術意義一文，亦是發揮這個意思）。「我」不過是個體，但要發揮這渾全的宇宙奧秘，除了個體郤無法進行。石濤能在萬物的存在中，發現到「我」，從「我」個體的存在，明白一切萬物的存在，而在牠們的真實裏會見了「同」，成就了一書的妙用。（衆妙之門）藉以貫通所有的器用。一書章：</p>
<p>「行遠登高，悉起膚寸，一書收盡鴻蒙之外，即億萬萬筆墨，非有不始於此而母於此」。</p>
<p>只有充沛個體之全，才能與億萬萬筆墨起相思相關的作用（以用成就體），石濤謂之萬法歸於一。所以尊受章：</p>
<p>「夫一書含萬物於中，盡受墨，墨受筆，筆受腕，腕受心，如天之造生，地這告成一，此其所以受也」。兼字章：</p>
<p>「一盡者，字觀先夫之根本也。」山川章：</p>
<p>「自一及萬，自萬及一，化一而成梱緼，天下之能事畢矣。」反過來說，山川章：</p>
<p>「一有不明，則萬物陰。一無不明，則萬物齊」。了法章：</p>
<p>「從心」才能入「無為而化」的境界，無為故無敗，無執故無失（老子語）。無敗無執，與天為一，藝術品就成為「天人的合作」。能夠從受任，明白了績養生活，從蒙養生活明白了一實的法則（乾旋坤轉之義）從一環的法則，明白了這運樸的宇宙（以二治萬的功夫）到天人合德的境界。那末，於石濤可以洞然於心目了，而且對這數千年儒道的哲學，亦可說思過半矣。</p>
<p>到這裏，作者想用兩節他自已的文字，替石濤做個註釋。海濱章：</p>
<p>「海有洪濤，山有潛伏，海有吞吐，山有拱揖。海能矚靈,山能脈運，山有層巒壘嶂，遂谷深崖，巑岏突兀，嵐氣霧露，烟雲畢至，猶如海之洪流，海之吞吐，此非海之矚靈，亦山之自居於海也，縱使棋，布星分，亦可以水源龍脈推而知之。若得之於海，失之於山，得之於山，失之於海，是人要受之也。我之受也，山即海也，海即由也，山海而知我也，皆在人一筆一墨之風流也」。</p>
<p>自然是洪流，石濤是一種潛伏的能量，自然吞吐，石濤有拱揖他的能力（受任）。自然矚靈於石濤，石濤龍脈連（襲養生活）這此自然的神靈，石濤在書面上許多幽情壯采，並非單憑自然的矚靈，而是石濤與自然的神靈相互融會。石濤本身他就相信自已就是自然，所以雖然石濤與萬物可以劃分，而在應靈和脈連上郤息息相通。如果我們能夠探索到萬物的幽靈，也可以我到石濤他血脈的所在。假如探得了萬法而失郤了石濤，或是採得了石濤，失郤萬法，這於尋求這位藝術家的發掘人說來，都是要受。真正的認識，就是在石濤與萬法中見到渾全不二，而作者之所以敢如此說；因為在大師留給我們筆墨底「風流」上，這所以謂之「石濤」。在山川章：</p>
<p>「此余五十年前未脫胎於由山川也，亦非糟粕其山川，而使山川自私也，山川使余代山川而言也，山川脫胎於予，予脫胎於山川也，搜盡奇峯打草稿也。山川與我神遇而跡化也，所以終歸之於大滌子」。</p>
<p>只有在物我兩忘的境界，才表露了這宇宙的渾樸天價。——這才所謂「大滌子」。</p>
<h3>幕間劇</h3>
<p>— 子蓉</p>
<p>——文藝術語誌五——</p>
<p>英語為Interlude　。在英國依麗莎白女皇時代，劇作家約翰。海福特開始創作了一種短時間內可以演出的戲劇，作為宴會等　的餘與，就名為「幕間劇」。</p>
<h3>問題小說·問題劇</h3>
<p>——文藝術語誌六——</p>
<p>這是產生於近代文藝上的一種傾向。在近伐生活裏所引起的社會問題，道德問題，宗教問題，婦女問題等等作為生題而寫作的小說，稱為問題小說。把這種傾向表現在劇本上，便稱為問題劇。易卜生的劇本使是問題劇的好例子。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風33</p>
<p>〔前情節略—八年抗戰，我國前後方以及淪陷區內，千百萬英勇的中華兒女，為了守衛祖國，拿鮮紅的熱血，洒遍了每寸山河。我們收集了這些悲壯的故實，來紀念恢復失士的艱苦。</p>
<p>第一個故實—「七封秘緘」—記載着倭寇勾結了歐陸的幾個戰魔，訂定了七紙秘密文件，要蹂躪世界，毀滅一切文化。</p>
<p>青年鶴兄王，從搖籃起到陸大畢業止，受的是「侵略教育」。也許是血統純正關係，充滿着一片正義感，看不慣倭寇軍閥那種破落戶的作風—奸，擄，燒，殺，放賭，販毒，敲詐，勒索，種種罪犯行為。正在起了反感的當口，偶然發見他本人原是一位中國老同盟同志古繼漢先生的嫡親後裔。同時又風聞「七封秘緘」的內容，設法揭露，來挽回這生靈塗炭的大刦。</p>
<p>他只有一個痛苦—他發現他正愛着一位夭矯不羣的東北女兒紀耀羣。因恐墮入情網，躭誤了大計，所以抱着必死的精神，衝入虎穴去探尋「七封秘緘」，却委託密友岳君—一位自由作家—代官長辛店秘密電台，又叫岳君把耀羣介紹給我東區反間諜組織主任W君，參加鋤奸工作。</p>
<p>耀羣也能體諒鶴見的苦心，便漏夜偕同小老虎—一位十三歲的北地技擊好手—辦完了投効手績，無匆匆跨上征途，上通州工作去了。</p>
<p>岳君　到北平，辦完了耀羣的事，立即進備團長辛店工作。這時正是「七七」之後，宛平大戰即將爆發，橫在他面前的，乃是一條慘酷的「死亡綫」……〕</p>

<h3>黃昏寂寞江岸</h3>
<p>— 宋陵</p>
<p>「夕陽無限好」一，已差強是初秋的黃昏了！滾滾的海浪。綠了又黃，黃了又綠。</p>
<p>島與的邊緣，漸從遠方進了視綫，輸舟過處，浩渺的烟波上，頓給劃開了一條大黃痕。空中，汽笛噴出了幾圈奇幻的圖案；告訴人，又將有一次靠岸了。</p>
<p>千百個生命，千百個希望，以及千百個譯音，一人在開始了些微的騷動。在太洋裏，為這渺小似一粟的萍舟，所寄與的空慮的感觸，又被轉填滿了存在。</p>
<p>對於初經海航的山鄉人，擺岸，是應有份特殊的溫暖的。</p>
<p>當夕陽在天水相接處只留下半個面龐時，船已棠擺埠頭；風雖然還是膽小地拂過海面，給裏巴不再悶熱煩燥了。</p>
<p>一醖釀中的人流，無可抑制地瀑發威洶湧的怒濤。</p>
<p>旅客，貨物，金錢……又一次的交流。</p>
<p>一蜂擁來的小販，撕裂了喉嚨，叫賣着未聽慣的音浪。有老頭子，有小女孩，有壯年人；一個藍，三只籠，一盆担；或捧，或頂，甲板上，岸邊……一樣是微顫的聲音，一樣是菜色面孔，破舊衣袂，以及一對閃着朦彩練冀求的眼光的眸子。</p>
<p>一根扁担，兩圈蔴繩，赤膊的苦力，疾旋人　裏，貨艙裏，哼着有力的原始之歌。</p>
<p>人間充滿著聲音，喧囂，熱鬧………</p>
<p>到處都迴流着力量……</p>
<p>西邊，淡淡地，落霞有意無意地替那螟朦的黃昏，渲染上晦暗的色彩。</p>
<p>軍兵卡，從人羣裏疾馳到碼頭，又是一個瘋狂的騒動；突然一個女孩子的尖銳的啼聲響了！一藍茶葉蛋，被着力地拋向遠遠……而在另一邊，那露天飯攤的前面，似乎有人在兇兇抽打……</p>
<p>聲音，人的聲音呢，從這邊漾開去，又從別處傳了過來。混雜的，整片的，連績的，都市氣味嘈喲只分辨不出那是喜，怒，哀樂，憎，嗟嘆還是歡忭。</p>

<p>人生之謎，原不便認真解釋的，從這據點，至於另一個落脚處，誰又不是都備嚐着希望，冀求，等待，飃流，掙扎……的味兒喲！</p>
<p>船又浮上了另一段更遠的航程，一條大黃龍似的足迹，一直向前作無垠的伸展……</p>
<p>千百個美麗的憬憧，在航行飄搖。</p>
<p>水碼頭，從迷糊以至於消失了！</p>
<p>應該照樣吧！這時光，它已由雜亂粉嘈重跌入寗靜，無言目送下埽後二線混和人海水的陽光。</p>
<p>第四章　死亡綫上</p>
<p>第二天早晨，未到破曉，耀羣和小老虎啣着行動總站的密令，與匆匆地跨上征途，向通州工作去了。承W君的美意，再三堅留我在北平耽擱一天，二方面要屈盡地主之誼，一方面也要趁此討論些以後合作的方式。</p>
<p>這一天從W君的談話中，我得到幾點關於全國局勢的報道；但與我們長辛店所得情報比較，似科稍有出入。我認為比較重要的幾點，現在寫在後面，您不妨參詳一下：</p>
<p>「平（指北平行動總部）：七·十·我外交部因七·七日非法行動，向日駐華大使提書面抗議，要求日方覆行（一）正式向中國道歉，並處罰負責人員：（二）賠價死傷及被燬一切損失；（三）擔保不發生類似事件。</p>
<p>辛（指長辛店秘密站所收日方電訊）：南京外交人員竟藉七七事件，要挾我道歉，處罰，賠價，等三點，似此，罷我帝國地位於何等？置我皇軍威望於何地？我首腦現觀此項無理要求，並無答覆必要，故置之理；因我方現時交涉之對手，乃冀察主席宋哲元將軍也。</p>

<h3>藝術販賣</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>偶然和幾個藝術界的朋友談閒天，知道最近上海流行着一種很不好的現象，在他們認爲是非常危險而急須科正的。</p>
<p>這現象就是收藏家們對於書畫的收藏，幾乎全部捨絹而取紙。</p>
<p>據朋友說：這一風氣的形成，完全由於牟利的市儈收藏家的作業。因爲絹類易於損壞，而紙類價錢可以賣得高。殊不知古代的藝術，特別是唐宋以前或唐宋的畫，大都是絹類，這樣一來，無異將古代藝術生命的延續斬斷，寖假若干年後，我們的文物源流，將不知其自何所出了，這對於一個民族的歷史湮滅，大有可能。</p>
<p>據這位朋友說：以前神州國光社，有正書局，他們的主要業務是翻印（即複製）藝術上的書畫，雖然他們的工作，並未做得完備，（比如那些美術畫片，僅僅很簡單地在畫旁註一行：某朝某人繪，不像日本人，他們會很詳細地說明這張畫的時代，作者，以及這張畫的優點特點，普及藝術知識，並啓導讀者對藝術的欣賞）但在保存與普及上總算還盡了點力，然而現在，又有誰在從事呢？</p>
<p>拜金在猛烈而又迅速的在蔓延，上海人透不過氣來了，打開這扇天窗，讓大家淸醒淸醒，把趣味提拔一下罷！</p>
<p>掌故</p>
<h3>跑馬廳的由來</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>舊時代的「遺產」</p>
<p>「鴉片戰爭」後，公歷一八四二年—道光二十二年，中英簽訂「南京條約」，規定五口通商，上海遂在一八四三年十一月十四日，正式闢爲商埠，由上海道台與英國領事喬治。巴爾福（George　Balfour）商洽劃定外僑寄居界綫，當時的面積祗有一百三十八英畝。之後，中英訂立「虎門附加條約」，其中第七款載明允許英人在五通商口岸租地造屋，但此時還未有「地皮章程」和「租界章程」。直到一八四五年，始由上海道台宮慕九以個人名義和英人訂立「地皮章程」二十四條，成爲英租界創設的根據。一八四八年，美租界成立，一八六三年，兩租界合併爲公共租界。</p>
<p>上海租界的「地皮章程」，曾在一八五四年，一八六九年，一八九八年先後改訂三次，修訂時並未邀請華方派人列席，祗由他們訂好之後，向中國發一紙通知，便作爲旣成事實。一九〇四年，上海道台出示准許工部局直接與華人業主商職土地，外人在租界的產權由此更可以任意擴充。跑馬廳的現址，原屬上海縣二十五保四圖，係一荒凉地，由英人購得後，產權遂爲其所有。</p>
<p>第一個上海跑馬塲，出現於一八五〇年，位在今日的南京路河南路以西。有舊日報章所載可以互相參證：「四月初五至初七，西番爲跑馬會，於城西二里許，圈地數頃爲馬埒，周圈樹以木栅，柵外濬溝，番人番婦，則於圈內建高合觀之，相與置金錢賭勝負。每數騎並發，衣五色服爲識別，追風躡電，亦壯觀也。」後經兩次遷移，始擇定靜安寺路興工建築，成立跑馬總會。每當春秋仕日，照例舉行賽馬，設獎售票，實同賭博，盈利收入，爲數驚人。一九三三年五月更將舊址拆卸，輝煌宏大的新厦，至一九三四年二月十日落成。</p>
<p>敵僞盤據時期，間有賽馬仍在原址舉行，但是國人對此興趣不濃，營業並不興旺。</p>
<p>目前，「賽馬」復活，傳說紛紛，參議會中將有熱烈辯論，下文如何，大家等着看下回分解好了！不過，說句客觀的話：賽馬恢復不恢復，經在政府，而絕對多數的市民，則無不堅決反對開放馬禁！我以爲：政府對於此舉，實在犯不着來與民意相抗拒！</p>
<h3>電車怠工</h3>
<p>— 佚羣</p>
<p>昨晨從家裏出來，走到電車站上，祇着見閑散地站着幾個人，往日的像長蛇陣一般排隊等候的情形，已不復存在，因爲情形異常，乃起懷疑，因此探問旁人，纔知今天電車又怠工了！</p>
<p>後來讀了報紙，纔知電車售票員二人，因行兇被拘，於是全體電取工人，爲表示援助或反抗起見？一致怠工，非達到釋放兇手，不再復工。</p>
<p>電車工人團結的力量，我們實感到相當偉大的，以前因爲要求增加薪水不遂而一度怠工，繼因借薪不遂又再度怠工，有一次有二個工人和某紗廠的工人打架而怠工，電車工人對於一二個人少數人的私事糾紛，往往就不惜使用武器，似乎過分高明了。過去的不談，試以昨天的怠工而論，二個售票員因行兇被拘，事情很簡單，是非曲直，當有事實可以證明，有罪無罪，有法律可以依據，電車工人如果守法明理的話，應該依法辦理，有委屈不妨公諸社會，讓大家來批判，如果說，竟以怠工爲武器，一方威脅法律，方又要博取社會的同情，我以爲這樣子何異緣木而求魚？</p>
<p>電車是公用事業之一，攸關大衆交通，請電車工人，勿以私事糾紛，而輕率怠工，以致妨礙公衆交通，須知你們服務的精神，以及對付乘客的態度，好壞自有公論，何必任意使用武器——怠工呢！</p>
<h3>上海橫斷面之一</h3>
<p>開學了，但失學的大孩子卻領着小孩子勤讀連環書本</p>
<p>— 季淸攝</p>
<h3>賭與稅</h3>
<p>— 羊仁</p>
<p>我曾經和一位朋友說笑話：現在百廢待興，而國庫短絀，一切地方事業，無從着手，假使政府能够利用國民好賭心理，公開在每個鄕鎭設一賭塲，規定「賭稅」，收入一定可觀，那末「民轍財而無厭，國得稅而長豐」，一舉兩得，生財之道，莫善於此了！</p>
<h3>「上海皇帝」萬歲</h3>
<p>— 西廷</p>
<p>如果選舉「上海皇帝」，我一定選英商電車公司的司機和售票員。</p>
<p>除了少數的汽車階級外，無數市民都是這一位皇帝的順民。當皇帝要向「子民」收稅的時候，也會和靄可親地說一聲「對不住！」（這時候你付了二百元，只拿到一百五十元的票子。）他們每一次向我低聲和氣地說一聲「對不住」時，我總有些受寵若驚，覺得神經過分緊張，不知如何是好；因爲我沒有忘記：當我上車時，皇帝那一付威嚴可畏的面孔；我更沒有忘記：每一次很空的車子過站不停，飄然而去的時候，使我氣憤。不過，也唯其因爲他們在不要我上車時是那麼聲色俱厲，所以當他們一旦變了而孔，愛民如子的時候，我會覺得這是格外的恩惠，因此對於所要納的「稅」，也義不容辭地納了。即使是心有未甘，但我總是阿Q地安慰自己：應該做一個泱泱大國民，剛才的事情，旣往不咎，現在人家旣然笑着臉向我要錢，我又何必那麼吝嗇呢？</p>
<p>同時，對於售票員大皇帝的責駡，我總是把它當做聖旨看，不敢稍有反抗，因爲不然的話，偶一發生侮辱皇帝事件，則全體皇帝說不定都要罷工，那麼我不是罪該萬死嗎？</p>
<p>最近，聽說常常發生電車人民和電車皇帝糾紛的事件，我非常欽羨這些「乘客子民」的「胆大包天」；對於這些皇帝，我是連看都不敢看的！</p>
<p>一，二，三：「上海皇帝萬歲！」</p>

<h3>新任海軍副總司令　桂永清的二三事</h3>
<p>— 重征</p>
<p>我國駐英軍事代表團團長桂水淸，已奉召返國，且榮任海軍副總司令，暫代行總司令職權。以他今日之地位，在黃出身中，除了胡宗南。杜聿明，關麟徵以外，幾無人可比。</p>
<p>桂氏江西貴決人，黃埔第一期畢業，卒業後服務軍隊，從排長到團長，這個階段，在第一期同學中，他算爬得最快的一個。在北伐戰爭中，他是一個勇敢善戰的下級幹部，當時，頗得何應欽將軍之器重。</p>
<p>爬城起家</p>
<p>記得有一次攻打某一個縣城，蔣主席親自指揮督戰，激戰數晝夜，始終不能攻入，無法可想，於是，命令何應欽將軍組織敢死隊，然而，什麽人才都有，惟缺少一個善於爬城進去做內綫的人，何將軍正在躊躇之時，桂氏自吿奮勇挺身而出，其實，他並不會爬城，也不過是一種勇氣，給果，一舉攻克，造成大捷。主席異常高興，馬上問何應欽，爬城進去的軍官叫什麼名字，何氏答：「桂永淸」，主席即下令晋升一級。從此主席與何應欽將軍的腦筋中，有着「桂永淸」三個字深刻的印象了。</p>
<p>北伐的功勳使他一躍爲敎導總隊少將總隊長，戰前，導總隊是全國模範的軍隊，官長皆爲軍校出身，士兵都是智識份子，教育是德國式，因此敎導總隊聞名於全國，成爲國人歌頌崇拜的一支典型部隊，桂將軍之揚名，也大半歸功於領導敎導總隊。</p>
<p>抗戰爆發，教導總隊首先自行參戰，其時，蔣委員長不願意他們去犧牲，然而，桂將軍所率領的健兒，一再堅持、他們的口號是：「忠黨愛國」。當國家千鈞一髮之時，正是軍人守土報國之機會。結果，敎導十總隊盡了他們最大的努力，到了剩下一槍一彈，最後一個人，也仍然英勇搏鬥。因此，全部壯烈的犧牲，這一種不知有小我的精神，也是桂將軍平日嚴格軍事訓練與敎育的培養所使然。但，蔣委員長聞悉後，曾揮淚痛泣，認爲這一批朝氣勃勃的靑年戰士的犧牲，是國家莫大的損失！</p>
<p>轉戰南北</p>
<p>上海失守後，桂氏依舊統帥大軍，轉戰南北戰塲，直至蘭封一役後，始奉調軍委會幹訓團敎育長之職，因此，在抗戰中許多人對他很生疏，其實，他一直站在抗戰的最前綫。軍委會幹訓團一批一批畢業的學生，就是桂氏敎育的成績。</p>
<p>卅三年桂氏奉命出任駐英軍事代表團長，德國投降，前往柏林考察歐洲軍事，與盟軍將領研究新軍事戰術及佔領與管制德國的計劃。他已是一個英美軍人所讚美的人物。</p>
<p>最近，桂永淸將軍返國了，而且担任了新海軍的副總司令，我們渴望他能不負老百姓們熱誠的愛戴，必爲重建的新海軍，辦出一些成績來！</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] Confirmed information states that the National Army in eastern Sui completely occupied Jining at 7:00 AM this morning, with the Communist Army collapsing and retreating towards Fengzhen and Xinghe.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] The American representative of the Military Mediation Department's Jining Team telegraphed the Military Mediation Department today, reporting that the National Army completely recovered Jining this morning. All team members are safe and sound and have met with the commanding officer of the National Army who entered the city in an amicable atmosphere. The American representative telegraphed yesterday afternoon that the National Army entered Jining at 8:00 PM on the 12th and had already recovered two-thirds of the city. According to this, the street fighting in Jining continued for one day and night. The Military Mediation Department immediately dispatched a plane to deliver medicine to the American team member who was injured in the leg by stray bullets and is considering returning the team to Beiping.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] According to relevant sources, after the National Army recovered Jining, they continued south along the railway line. There are no Communist troops within several miles around Jining City. However, about fifty regiments of the Communist Army have gathered on the south side of the railway west of Jining, up to the vicinity of Fengzhen. On the one hand, they are cutting off the National Army's retreat from the west of Jining, and at the same time, they are preparing for a desperate battle in Fengzhen. The garrison in Datong reported this morning that the situation is becoming more relaxed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 13th] According to confirmed sources, the Communist Army dispatched over fifty regiments from Zhangyuan and other places in northern Jin to fight in Jining, including He Long's Independent First, Second, Third, New Fourth, 358th, and other five brigades, Yao Zhe's four regiments directly under the Sui Meng Military Region, as well as the Second Cavalry Brigade, the Sixth Independent Brigade, the Jin Ji Cha Military Region's Instructor Brigade, and the 11th, 12th, and 13th Field Brigades under Nie Rongzhen's 19th Military Sub-district, the Jin Sui 5th Military Sub-district, the Jin Ji 5th Military Sub-district, the New 5th Brigade, and the 7th Guerrilla Detachment, totaling sixteen brigades and one detachment, amounting to over fifty regiments, approximately 70,000 to 80,000 people, including coerced militia, are not included.</p>

<p>Recapture of Ningcheng in the Rehe Area</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 14th] Ningcheng, northwest of Yebaishou, west of Jianping, which had been occupied by the Communist Army for a long time, was recaptured by the National Army on the 11th.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 14th] The section between Pingquan and Chengde on the Jin Gu Line was severely damaged by the Communist Army, and it is feared that it will not be fully repaired for two months. The Communist Army planted many landmines in Chengde, and explosions are frequently heard. Although there are rumors that a regiment of the Communist Army is lurking in the city, the local area is extremely peaceful due to strict defense. Prices are gradually increasing, but they are still cheaper than in other places. A dou (30 jin) of rice sells for 600 Northeastern Circulation Notes, local flour costs 35 yuan per jin, pork costs 40 yuan per jin. Daily necessities are extremely scarce, but merchants are quick to act. Jinzhou cigarettes and towels have appeared on the streets. The Eighth Route Army currency has ceased circulation, and the Northeastern Circulation Notes are circulating on the market. The general public is in a very difficult situation. The relief supplies from Madame Chiang Kai-shek for the Northeastern refugees have been distributed to 500 people, with each person receiving 500 Circulation Notes. The refugees are very grateful.</p>

<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 14th] It has just been learned that after the Zhangdian Self-Defense Force withdrew from the town yesterday morning, it immediately cooperated with a unit of the National Army stationed in Fengjiabao and recaptured the town at 4:00 AM.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 14th] Observing the war situation in northern Jiangsu, there is a sense that a storm is brewing again. The Communist Army's attempts to stir up trouble on the eastern front have not diminished at all. Although there is no fighting on the western front, the Communist Army's movements along the canal embankment are frequent, and it seems that a new action is about to be taken. According to an observer, a major battle is almost inevitable, but the timing is not yet ripe.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 14th] According to official sources, after the fierce battle in Yanghejing on the 5th, the National Army formally moved into the area at 7:30 PM on the 13th, and local order is being restored.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting South of Baoding; National Army Recaptures Weicun; Counties in Eastern Hebei Begin "Cleansing the Villages"</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] Baoding Telephone: (1) After three days of seesaw battles southwest of Baoding, the National Army finally recaptured Weicun this morning and is continuing to advance south. There is fierce fighting at Wuqiao in the east of Baoding, but progress is hindered by the flooding of the river on the Gaoyang Road. (2) The Hebei Provincial Government yesterday telegraphed the magistrates of the sixteen counties in southern Hebei to assist refugees in returning to their hometowns and to promote the work of "cleansing the villages." The Provincial Government also telegraphed the Central Government to allocate 1.8 billion yuan to relieve the people in the newly recovered counties.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 14th] The war in eastern Hebei has reached its final stage. Sun Zhenbang, the director of the Hebei Civil Affairs Department, went to Tangshan a few days ago and is still stationed there, supervising the "cleansing the villages" work in the recovered counties.

After a regiment of the National Army reinforced Weicun Town, there were three major battles on the 13th. The National Army has cut off the Communist Army's supply line, and over ten thousand Communist troops are retreating towards the Longquan River.

(This does not include the more than 13,400 prisoners of war.) These defected and captured personnel have now been sent back to their hometowns or assisted in further education and employment. Therefore, it is generally felt that the government's tolerance is deeply appreciated, and the CCP's claim that the government does not allow defection is self-defeating.</p>
<h3>The Military Mediation Department in Beiping Once Reached an Agreement</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] It is reported that the Military Mediation Department reached an agreement on September 5th, with the following three main points: (1) Any accusations of espionage against personnel of the Military Mediation Department may only be submitted to the Three-Man Committee, who will take appropriate measures.

He used a cane to climb mountains such as the Daliu Road and the Rizhao Peak to inspect and find a small base on Lushan for helicopters, which are about to enter a wide application stage. The inspection results showed that there is no suitable, ideal place for reconstruction. The general believes that although future helicopter takeoffs and landings do not require large airports, it is best to choose a flat-topped highland with sparse trees and few houses. He has presented this opinion to Military Attache Xia to forward to the President.</p>
<h3>General Blair to Return to the United States on Schedule</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] General Blair, the former director of the Northeastern branch of the Military Mediation Department, is scheduled to leave Beiping with his family on the 25th of this month to return to the United States.</p>

<h3>American Soldiers Search Residents' Homes in Qinhuangdao; This Act Is Detrimental to Sino-US Relations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 14th] The Dagongbao published an article in its "Readers' Letters" column, stating that its Qinhuangdao residence was searched by three American military police officers on the 8th of this month, and no Chinese police accompanied them at the time. This kind of behavior by the American military police is an infringement of Chinese sovereignty and is detrimental to Sino-US relations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 14th] An American military police officer in Beiping previously shot and injured Cao Huiming, a Chinese student wearing US khaki military pants. According to the US military authorities, this was unintentional. Cao has been hospitalized for treatment after being injured.

The US military has agreed to pay Cao's medical expenses and has stated to the Chinese police that the US military will not take such action again in the future except in self-defense.</p>

<h3>US Ambassador Talks About Current Situation; Resolves to Work with Marshal Ma to Promote Peace; Met with Zhou Enlai Yesterday and Visited President Song</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Zhou Enlai visited US Ambassador Stuart at 10:30 AM on the 14th by appointment, and only left after talking for two hours. Afterwards, according to the spokesperson of the Communist Party delegation, what was discussed today was still the three-man military conference, and a ceasefire must come first before other matters can be discussed. He also formally expressed to Ambassador Stuart on the 14th that he refused to participate in the informal five-person group meeting, believing that the meeting could not solve the problem and was meaningless. The matter of reorganizing the government committee's quota was only a few words on the point of the fourteen places that the Communist Party agreed to, and there was no need to hold a meeting to discuss it. When asked by reporters what attitude the Communist Party would take if the five-person group meeting and the three-man military conference were held at the same time, the spokesperson said: The Communist Party will not participate, and it is also impossible.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] After receiving Zhou Enlai on the 14th, Ambassador Stuart and his personal advisor Fu Jingbo went to Beijige to attend a lunch banquet hosted by President Song. In the afternoon, at 6:00 PM, he went out in response to a friend's invitation, and Fu visited Wu Tiecheng at the same time for talks.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Regarding the United Press report that "Marshal Ma has refused to accept the CCP's request to reopen the three-man military group meeting," the reporter specifically asked Ambassador Stuart about this on the 14th. The ambassador said: This statement is half right and half wrong, because we are still seeking an appropriate way to achieve our original intention, and political consultations must be effective before the three-man military conference can be raised again. He also said: If there is something to be gained politically, then the remaining problems will be easily solved. The reporter then asked what the ambassador thought of the statement made by Wu Tiecheng, the government representative to the informal five-person group meeting, that "the meeting has not failed." The ambassador replied: "That's right," and I also believe that it has not failed. At this point, the existence of the five-person meeting was further confirmed. The ambassador then smiled and said: "The current situation is still hopeful." When asked again by the reporter whether the ambassador would continue to make efforts in this direction, the ambassador said: "I am still working hard. I am more anxious than anyone else. I want to see a new development every day, but until now, it has not been time to announce it."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Authoritative sources say: Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart both suggested convening an informal five-person group first, and then convening a three-man military conference, to achieve a ceasefire and peace. At first, both sides of the informal five-person meeting had appointed representatives, but then the Communist Party refused to participate, using the US's granting of surplus materials as an excuse. If the five-person meeting can be held, starting with political issues and proceeding gradually, it is possible to reach a ceasefire. Some people doubt that if the government's five demands are mentioned again during the informal five-person meeting, what will happen? It is said that if this happens, the three-man military conference can be convened at the same time, so that military and political issues can be addressed simultaneously.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] According to reliable sources, Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart have been working tirelessly to promote peace. After Marshal Ma went to Lushan eight times, Ambassador Stuart continued to contact the government and Communist Party representatives, hoping to break the deadlock amid numerous obstacles. When the ambassador met with reporters at 5:30 PM this afternoon, he said optimistically: "I am more anxious about the current situation than you, but the negotiations have not yet broken down, and hope has not been extinguished." The ambassador also said, "Marshal Ma and I share the same view, that we should start with political issues and then resolve military issues." The ambassador finally said, "Marshal Ma and I will work tirelessly, even if the five-person group is suspended, we will find other ways."</p>
<h3>Chiefs of National Defense Inspect Troops Stationed in the Suburbs of Nanjing; Nanjing Self-Defense Force to Be Established in October</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Tang Enbo accompanied the chiefs of the Ministry of National Defense in inspecting the garrison troops in Pukou on the 14th and conducted live-fire exercises. On the 15th, he inspected the troops near the urban area. Also, the Nanjing Civilian Self-Defense Force can be established in early October. According to the person in charge of the team, the Self-Defense Force is purely a peacetime organization, and it will be divided into groups in the future, according to each person's skills, to perform duties.</p>
<h3>Marshal and Mrs. Marshall Visit Huanglong Temple Together</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 14th] Marshal and Mrs. Marshall visited Huanglong Temple together at 11:00 AM on the 14th to spend the weekend, and had a picnic in the shade of the Bodhi tree planted in front of the temple during the Jin Dynasty. They returned at around 1:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Whereabouts of Contemporary Figures</h3>

<p>Taipei Telegram Xie Nanguang, a specialist of the Chinese delegation to the Committee for the Control of Japan, left Taiwan for Shanghai on the 14th, and will transfer from Shanghai to Tokyo on the 15th.</p>
<h3>President to Go to Nanchang Tomorrow; People of Jiangxi from Various Counties on the Guangdong Border Arrive in the Province to Welcome Him</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 14th] It is rumored that President Chiang plans to come to Nanchang the day after tomorrow. Unless there are important official matters to be dealt with, it will not be delayed. After the President arrives in the province, he will attend the welcome rally from all walks of life and deliver a speech. He will listen to reports from all parties on the work of the Jiangxi Province's restoration, so as to review it, and he will personally convene the Sixth Officers' General Team in Qingyunpu to encourage the nearly 8,000 surplus officers and instruct them on the understanding they should have before and after the transfer. General Chen Pei, the commander of the Sixth General Team, led the officers of the team and has been waiting in formation at the new airport for three days. The people of Jiangxi have come from various counties on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border to the province to welcome him.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 14th] The President's headquarters has now been arranged and is located in the eastern part of Xiong Shihui's mansion in the new residential area of Nanchang. The magnificent Lizhi Society and the President's former residence in Nanchang are only a short distance away. The environment of the headquarters is beautiful, with egrets flying and wisteria climbing. Green bamboo curtains are hung on the doors and windows, making it the only cool and scenic villa in Nanchang.</p>
<h3>Mei Siping, Traitor, Executed by Firing Squad in Beijing; Left Words to Children: "Strive to Study and Serve the Country"</h3>
<p>— Our Beijing Correspondent, Pu Dejie</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:50 AM, in the northeastern corner of the grassy grounds of the Capital Prison at Tiger Bridge, Zhujiang Road, Nanjing, with a "bang," the major traitor Mei Siping fell. One year after the victory, on the ravaged and desolate land of Nanjing, the blood of ugliness and treachery was shed for the first time. At 7:25 AM, Mei was awakened from his dream by a bailiff. "The Warden wants to speak with you," he was told. He neatly put on his white spun silk shirt, bluish-gray trousers, and thin-soled black gauze shoes. He stepped out of Loyal Prison, Number Four. He saw the gloomy sky overhead, the gleam of greedy reporters' cameras in front of him, and the merciless earth beneath his feet. His face turned ashen. He understood. "Why didn't you tell me earlier? I haven't said goodbye to my friends. Please bring me a package of books and letters." At that moment, a simple courtroom had been set up in a hall. Chen Shengzu, Prosecutor of the Capital High Court, sat in the center, Prison Warden Kong Xiangxian on the left, and Clerk Jiang Fucheng on the right. The final questioning began: "Are you Mei Siping?" "Yes." "How old are you?" "Fifty years old." "Where are you from?" "Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province." "Where do you live?" "Originally at Number 42, Beiping Road." "Were you imprisoned for being a traitor?" "Yes." "Was the death sentence handed down by the Capital High Court?" "Yes." "Very well. Now, the Capital High Court Procuratorate, acting on instructions forwarded by the Supreme Court Procuratorate and on the order of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, has rejected your appeal, and the execution is to be carried out immediately. Do you understand?" Mei nodded silently. "You don't need to say anything more now. Do you have any last words for your family and friends?" "I do." Mei took the white cloth bundle that the bailiff brought him. "I have already written three letters, but I haven't signed and dated them yet. May I write them now?" "You may." So the bailiff moved the official case documents aside, and Mei bent over the table and wrote his name on each letter. The first one was to be forwarded to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek through Minister Xie Guansheng. It was three pages long, beginning with "Respectfully, Chairman Chiang..." and containing phrases such as "the future of the Chinese nation." The second letter was to Minister Xie and two Vice Ministers, Hong Ludong and Xie Zhou. Mei said, "I am good friends with those three. This letter is to thank them for their friendship and to ask them to forward my letter to the Chairman." The third letter was for his family, one for his brothers, reading, "Zufang, Zuyin, my two brothers, I die for the country, for the two hundred million people in the occupied areas. My conscience is clear... Read extensively the history of the Southern and Northern Dynasties, the Song, Qi, Liang, and Later Wei dynasties..." A couplet for his wife read, "Shouxiang, I have never done anything bad in my life. I have never done anything against my conscience... I hope you will educate our children well and make them useful to society and the country..." For his children, there was a hanging scroll with the eight characters: "Strive to study, loyally serve the country." Prosecutor Chen accepted them one by one, telling him, "I will certainly deliver them all for you." At this moment, Mei said, "I have two requests. First, whether the execution be by shooting or hanging. Second, not to be bound. I also ask the court to instruct its staff not to desecrate my body after my death." The Prosecutor said, "We will try our best to minimize your suffering on the first point, and you need not worry on the second point. Is there anything else you want to say?" "I deeply regret not having said goodbye to my friends who live with me. Also, please tell my family to bury me in Nanjing if possible." Prosecutor Chen nodded, picked up his pen, and heavily wrote the four characters "Death Sentence Executed" on the execution order, drawing a line above and below the three characters "Mei Siping." Two bailiffs helped Mei out of the courtroom, into the empty grassy area behind the prison, and towards the northeast corner of the prison wall. At this point, Chief Constable Zhu Kunfeng, the executioner, raised the Number Two pistol in his hand, and with a "bang," the bullet entered from the back of the head and exited from the right nostril. A gush of blood spurted out, staining a patch of the clean green grass. Mei Siping ended his absurd life. At 10:30 AM, District Court Prosecutor Wang Shaozeng, forensic doctor Ying Cai, and Inspector Song Shihau led bailiffs to examine the body. At 10:40 AM, Mei's younger brother, Mei Zufang, came to discuss the arrangements for collecting the body. Mei said that his brother's family, except for his eldest daughter, Mei Aiwen, who had left the family, were all in their hometown of Wenzhou. Mei Siping's funeral arrangements would be handled by him. At 11:00 AM, the hearse from the China Funeral Parlor took the body of this major traitor out of the back gate of the Dashiqiao Prison. As it passed the back window of "Loyal Prison," several major traitors, led by Lin Bosheng, bowed to pay their respects. These incorrigibly stubborn elements must have had a sense of "the rabbit mourns the fox's death." (Dispatch from Nanjing, 14th)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Major traitor Mei Siping was executed by firing squad on the morning of the 14th. Since the Capital High Court began trying traitors, Mei is the first to be executed. Mei was one of the major traitors in the puppet regime, serving successively as minister of various puppet organizations, including the Minister of Propaganda, Minister of Industry and Commerce, Minister of Interior, and Governor of Zhejiang Province, among other important positions. Moreover, he was one of the earliest participants in the aforementioned initial conspiracy to collude with the enemy. The Capital High Court sentenced him to death three months ago, during which time the defendant's family applied for retrial twice, but both were rejected by the court.</p>
<p>Military Traitor Li Zhigan Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Military traitor Li Zhigan was sentenced to death for the crimes of gathering crowds for riots and colluding with the enemy to purchase grain. He was stripped of his civil rights for life, and all his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, was confiscated. The sentence was pronounced at 3:00 PM on the 14th, and the convict was immediately taken to the execution ground and executed by firing squad.</p>

<h3>Intense Debate in the Legislative Yuan on the Organization of the Supreme Economic Council; Generally Considered Unnecessary, Resolution Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] The Legislative Yuan held its 307th regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th. Sixty-three members of the Legislative Yuan were present, presided over by Speaker Sun. After the report items, the following were discussed: (1) Re-examination of the draft Standard Law, resolved and passed. (2) Draft Organization Law of the Supreme Economic Council, resolution postponed. (3) Draft revised articles of the Income Tax Law, resolved and passed as amended. (4) Draft revised articles 9 and 15 of the Organization Law of the National Government Military Council, resolved and passed. (5) Proposal by Legislative Yuan member Chen Anren: drafting a jury system bill, resolved to be submitted to the Joint Committee on Civil and Criminal Law for study. (6) Revision of the wartime national budget compilation and review methods and subject table, revised budget bill, resolved and passed. (7) Draft revised articles of the regulations on compensation and retirement for school teachers and staff, resolved not to be revised and passed according to the review opinions. (8) Draft revised Transaction Tax Law, resolved and passed. (9) The Finance Committee, together with the Economic Committee and the Commercial Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, reported on the work of the nine-member committee on finance, economy, and commercial law, resolved to re-examine. Temporary motions: (1) Proposed by Liu Buming, Chen Changqiang, and 14 others, to be reviewed by the Supreme National Defense Council upon the recommendation of the Legislative Yuan. (2) Proposed by Liu Buming and nine others: the tax exemption amount of the Income Tax Law should be adjusted at any time according to the average price index, resolved to be submitted to the Finance Committee for review.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 14th] In today's Legislative Yuan regular meeting, the most intense debate was on whether or not to pass the draft Organization Law of the Supreme Economic Council. Several members advocated rejecting the proposal, for the following reasons: (1) The national economy is in difficulty, and the organization of this council is too large, seemingly established only for certain bureaucrats; (2) This council seems to be a reincarnation of the Production Bureau, but the Production Bureau was still under the Executive Yuan, while this council directly reports to the National Government. Now that the circumstances have changed, it would be best to abolish it; (3) Establishing this institution will not increase the efficiency of the Executive Yuan, but rather reduce it, and even if there is such an institution, it is not enough to increase international prestige; (4) The various departments under this council are equivalent to the relevant economic departments under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, and the personnel are also the same, as if there were two Executive Yuans; (5) Such a dictatorial economic council is unheard of in the world, and it should not exist in theory, and it is equivalent to non-existence in practice; (6) National revitalization should have a grand spirit, and setting up an institution for private individuals is petty; (7) The country has already consumed a great deal, and if this proposal is passed again, the consumption will be even greater, so the Legislative Yuan should immediately propose its abolition to reduce the burden on the people. The above arguments all advocated rejection, and were proposed by members such as Liu Buming, Li Qing, and Chen Haicheng. Subsequently, Ma Yinchu stood up and spoke directly, believing that it may not be possible to reject it in fact. If the central government rejects it, then we can reject it again. If the Legislative Yuan must pass it, the Legislative Yuan can be reorganized and another group of people can be replaced to pass the proposal. At this point, Speaker Sun said: "If the central government's task is rejected, it would be illegal, because it is not an elected Legislative Yuan now. If it is submitted by the Executive Yuan, it can be rejected. Now, it can only be suggested or re-examined." As a result, it was generally agreed that the council was not necessary, and that it was established without legislative procedures, "violating laws and destroying discipline," which was extremely illegal, so it was resolved to postpone the discussion.</p>
<h3>Two Supervisors Illegally Agreed on Changchun Railway Assets, Humiliating the Nation; Northeast Investigation Team Cables Central Government Requesting Punishment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] This reporter visited the person in charge of the Northeast Region Receiving Work Investigation Team on the 13th and received details on the case of Senior Supervisors Gao Lunjin and Qiu Weiying of the Changchun Railway Asset Determination Committee illegally signing a resolution that humiliated the nation. According to the report: The Organization Law of the Changchun Railway Asset Determination Committee originally stipulated that meetings would be held in Chongqing, with three members each from China and the Soviet Union. However, on January 24 of this year, Gao and Qiu held meetings with the Soviet side in Qia, totaling sixteen meetings. At the first meeting, Senior Supervisor Gao declared to the Soviet side that the government had granted him full power and recognized the meeting as formal. At the second meeting, Senior Supervisor Gao stated during the discussion that the presence of two of our members was enough of a majority, and if the opinions were consistent, the third member could not object. The fourth meeting resolved that the three main lines of Haman, Hahuan, and Hada, totaling 2,464 kilometers, and six branch lines (Dashiqiao to Yingkou, Jinzhou to Chengzitong, Dafangshen, Liushutun, Nanlingguan to Ganjingzi, Zhoushuizi to Lushun, and Zhoushuizi to Dalian), totaling 62 kilometers, together with all large and small stations and in-station lines, and applied technical houses and buildings, and station equipment, were all designated as Changchun Railway property. The fifth meeting resolved that 17 branch lines and sidings of coal mines, totaling about 400 kilometers, together with all station houses, buildings, and equipment, were all designated as Changchun Railway property. The sixth meeting resolved that forest branch lines and sidings, totaling about 800 kilometers, together with all stations, houses, buildings, and equipment, were all designated as Changchun Railway property. The seventh meeting resolved that the Shichazi lime branch line and siding, totaling about 150 kilometers, together with all station houses, buildings, and equipment, were all designated as Changchun Railway property. The eighth meeting resolved that 51 medical institutions along the line, together with all warehouses, pharmacies, laundry rooms, disinfection rooms, buildings, and equipment, were all designated as Changchun Railway property. In the remaining eight meetings, some were signed and some were passed but not yet signed. On February 27, the team received a fast mail telegram from citizens of Harbin, stating that Gao Lunjin had sold the Songhua River Railway Bridge in Songpuzhen, the Sanke Tree Locomotive Repair Factory, and land in the Shixiangfang area to the Changchun Railway at a price. The proceeds from the sale were not paid in cash by the Changchun Railway, but were used as our country's investment in the Changchun Railway. The Songpu Railway Bridge is the only way to pass for our country's La (Hai) Bin (Harbin) (Hu) Lan (Hai) Lun railways. It is recognized that Gao charges a toll of 75,000 yuan for each train passing over the bridge. Coal is charged a toll of 50 yuan per ton. With 30 trains passing through daily, the country suffers a huge loss. Moreover, the most important thing is that the Mudanjiang to Tuchengzi and Jixi to Linkou lines, as well as the Mudanjiang District line, Angangxi District line, Changchun District line, Sipingjie District line, and Liaoyang District line, a total of six places, are where our country's state-owned railways intersect with the Changchun Railway. It should not cut off our country's money-making roads by ten kilometers and allocate them to the Changchun Railway, making it impossible for our trains to reach the final destination platform. Even if a contract is signed with the Changchun Railway, a large amount of toll fees must be paid, and it cannot be exempted from various restrictions, resulting in the state-owned railway's revenue plummeting. Gao Lunjin and Qiu Weiying's duties were to investigate: which industries belonged to the Changchun Railway before 1905, and which industries were owned by the country after 1905, according to the agenda, the Organization Law of the Asset Committee stipulated that one member should be sent from China and the Soviet Union, and the meeting place for the three-person meeting was in Chongqing. There was no clause that stipulated the number of attendees over half the number. However, Gao Lunjin took advantage of his visit to Harbin to investigate materials and held a formal meeting of the Asset Committee in Harbin without notifying the Changchun Railway Board of Directors. Such acts of national humiliation, selling the country, and extreme illegality have been reported to the central government, requesting punishment.</p>
<h3>30,000 Taels of Confiscated Opium to Be Publicly Burned on a Set Date</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] The Xiang, E, and Gan District Investigation Team previously suggested that the authorities here burn the received opium in advance. However, the provincial authorities insisted on reporting to the Executive Yuan before it could be handled carefully. Some people also argued that one tael of opium was worth one tael of gold, and requested that it be temporarily preserved, which led to the matter being shelved for a time. It is now learned that the team has received a reply from the Executive Yuan approving the burning of the opium locally, and with the consent of the provincial government, it has been decided to publicly burn the 30,000 taels of opium next week. Moreover, the team's work has not yet been fully completed, and they are considering extending their stay in Hankou.</p>
<h3>Wuchang to Be Established as a City</h3>
<p>Passed by Hubei Provincial Government Regular Meeting</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 14th] The Hubei Provincial Government regular meeting passed the proposal to establish Wuchang as a city today, and plans to establish county banks universally.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Is There a Fork in the Road for American Diplomacy?</h3>
<p>U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace gave a speech to the Political Action Committee of American Left-Wing Citizens the day before yesterday, vigorously arguing that there is a need to change the course of American foreign policy. The main points of his speech were four: (1) Britain's adoption of an imperialist policy in the Near East and the Soviet Union's adoption of a retaliatory policy are sufficient to draw the United States into war; unless the United States adopts a clear and realistic policy, it cannot avoid war. (2) The United States should observe the world political situation with its own eyes, and not with pro-British or pro-Soviet eyes; although Americans love the British, it is a mistake to take Britain as the point of the American foreign policy. (3) The United States and the Soviet Union should divide spheres of influence and not interfere with each other. It must be outside the two major spheres of influence; however, for world trade, China should open its doors.</p>
<p>Wallace's speech in his capacity as Secretary of Commerce is originally not worth emphasizing in the United States, where there is freedom of speech; however, Wallace, who previously served as Vice President, had the content of his speech approved by President Truman before giving it, and Truman later publicly expressed his agreement with Wallace's speech. Moreover, Wallace visited China during the War of Resistance, and he is extremely concerned about the situation in the Far East. This speech, which advocates that the United States change its foreign policy, cannot be said to be of great significance. However, are there no difficulties in practice with the new policy proposed by Wallace? Should American foreign policy pave a new path today? Let us state our views:</p>
<p>First, the new policy advocated by Wallace and Secretary of State James Byrnes' policy toward Germany announced in Stuttgart, Germany, not only contradict each other in spirit and substance, but also run counter to each other. Where will American foreign policy go? It has become the most serious problem. Although President Truman said that there are no contradictions between the speeches of Byrnes and Wallace, this statement is too vague, and who believes it? Therefore, people all over the world are still waiting for President Truman's reiterated statement. Internal opinions in the United States are afraid of the inevitable division of ways, and the struggle between the two foreign policy lines will intensify. Perhaps Wallace's speech has caused a great uproar in the American diplomatic community; however, the American people and Congress will choose their path.</p>
<p>Second, cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to jointly create world peace was originally the common and unanimous hope of the people of all countries after the war. Unfortunately, after the war, the three countries, due to conflicts of interest, tended to diverge, which created the current stalemate, so that the post-war world could return to normal as soon as possible. In early December last year, Byrnes also had great determination and personally flew to Moscow to seek a compromise between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, attempting to solve all post-war problems on the basis of trilateral coordination. At that time, when people saw the declaration issued by the three foreign ministers, who was not delighted and thought that the future of the world was full of detailed and bright prospects; however, like a flash in the pan, it soon disappeared. This piece of history is enough to prove that it is not possible to achieve three-way cooperation in one fell swoop. It is easy to share adversity, but difficult to share prosperity! The world is not yet at peace, and the relationship between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union is already like this. Can Wallace not see the reason?</p>
<p>Third, the conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union are not limited to land alone, and the same is true in Asia. Therefore, the United States feels particularly anxious about the China issue. According to the agreement reached at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, a decision was also made on the China portion. In short, the three countries do not interfere in China's internal affairs. China is among the five powers after the war, and the three powers declared that they would not interfere in China's internal affairs. In the eyes of the Chinese people, this is already close to insult! Wallace's speech this time states that it will not be included in any sphere of influence, as if this is respecting China's independence. In fact, this still fails to recognize China's position in the Far East, and the Chinese people dare not incline to accept this attitude. Especially ridiculous is that Wallace has not forgotten the "Open Door Policy," which makes us unable to help but speculate on Wallace's intentions in establishing a coalition government. This is as if on the one hand, he said he would not interfere with a friend's diet, but on the other hand, he forced him to eat bread but not rice!</p>
<p>Fourth, there are contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but how can there be no contradictions between Britain and the United States? How to make all countries satisfied and be able to understand each other is indeed a serious problem. In his speech, Wallace called Britain's policy in the Near East imperialist. This sentence has aroused the indignation of the British government and the public. It is expected that the discord between Britain and the United States is also beginning to appear. The world political situation is really like a mess; if everyone does not realize it, there is no way to sort it out.</p>
<h3>Marshal Ma Ascends Guling for the Eighth Time</h3>
<p>The current negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have always been revolving around in circles because the CCP has adopted a "dragging" approach, and no conclusion has been reached, causing our mediators to suffer repeated setbacks. However, the mediators, with the spirit of "never give up" and indomitable, continue to work hard to mediate regardless of any hardship, attempting to break the current stalemate. Special Envoy George Marshall flew to Guling again the day before yesterday. This is Marshal Ma's eighth ascent of Guling! This spirit of knowing that it cannot be done and still doing it makes us both admire and ashamed.</p>
<p>It is said that Marshal Ma's purpose of flying to Guling this time is to convey the central government's proposal to reopen the military three-person meeting, but another saying is that Marshal Ma has rejected this proposal. According to the CCP spokesperson, the CCP believes that the five-person group meeting has failed to obtain sufficient guarantees and is afraid that it will be difficult to achieve peace, so it refuses to participate and wants to go back to the old way and advocates reopening the military three-person meeting. However, no one dares to assert whether the CCP's claim has the slightest sincerity. Because in the eyes of our common people, if reopening the military three-person meeting can break the current stalemate, then quickly convening the five-person group meeting will also be able to achieve peace. Moreover, the military three-person group had no way to do anything before, the ceasefire agreement was signed but was ineffective, and the central government repeatedly issued ceasefire orders, which the Communist Party repeatedly violated, so what is the use of reopening the military three-person group? The CCP is simply playing tricks, and besides the fact that he is deliberately creating complications, there is really no other legitimate reason to be found. Therefore, Special Envoy Marshall was also very indifferent to this, but in order to do everything possible and to pick up his wife, it is also okay to fly to Guling again for a final effort. We really have nothing to say about Marshal Ma's ascent to Guling in the scorching heat and thin clouds, but who wants him to do this? Even if the CCP intends to "oppose the United States," there should be a limit to deceiving people!</p>
<p>Now, the crux of the stalled negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is obviously entirely on the Communist Party's side. They talk about peace in words and say "unconditional peace" all the time, but in practice, the domestic wars are all caused by the Communist Party, and military and political conditions emerge one after another. At the beginning of the enemy's return to surrender, it and the government "contended for surrender"; when the "contention for surrender" came to an end, it relied on its military force and expanded its territory everywhere, but it did not dare to openly claim to be the head of the military. Instead, it hid behind the smoke screen of negotiations and engaged in conspiracies to sabotage transportation. Until today, the hideous face of the Communist Party has been gradually exposed, and its ultimate goal is nothing more than to dismember the country and turn a unified and peaceful China into a divided and warring China! Recently, the CCP has claimed that it will convene a people's representative conference in the "liberated areas" and then organize its "central government," which is both a threat and another explanation of the CCP's ambition. Recently, a reporter from the Chicago Sun Times discussed the current situation in China in detail, saying that "the CCP is obstructing peace and has long lost the sympathy of the people." It is a truly insightful statement.</p>
<p>The Chinese people are too weak and too pitiful! China has already been like this, hostile to the country, and our common people, just like mediator Marshal Ma, are still begging the Communist Party to wake up and "lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." In fact, what hope is there? "Those who act unjustly will destroy themselves!" The CCP may have such a day in the future.</p>
<h3>The Smooth Progress of the Investigation is Uncertain; Many Complex Problems Exist; The Amount of Corruption Accepted by Two Bureau Chiefs in Taiwan Province is Staggering</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 14th] Fan Zisui, Wu Cangzhou, and Du Guangxun, the persons in charge of the investigation team in Nanjing, stated that the received lists submitted by various agencies were mostly self-revised. They were unable to read the original lists, leaving them feeling at a loss.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Taipei on the 14th] The investigation team has reported the cases of Ren Weijun, the director of the Taiwan Monopoly Bureau, and Yu Baixi, the director of the Trade Bureau. It is reported that the director of the Monopoly Bureau embezzled 30,000 Taiwan dollars, including 50,000 tons of salt, 84 kilograms of opium, and 2.5 tons of camphor. The Trade Bureau failed to report 22 kinds of received materials, one of which amounted to 3 million. Currently, the deputy directors of the two bureaus are acting on their behalf. Public opinion believes that Chief Chen's insistence on the specialization of special institutions and policies in Taiwan Province has been struck a blow due to unsound personnel arrangements.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Special Dispatch] Yang Gaogong, the supervisory commissioner of Fujian and Taiwan, and also the head of the first organization of the investigation team in the Fujian-Taiwan region, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Xiamen on the 14th. According to Yang's statement to reporters regarding the receiving work of the investigation team in Fujian Province, there are more than ten receiving agencies in Xiamen and Kinmen, and the investigation has been largely completed. A total of forty-one secret reports from the public regarding receiving incidents have been received. Several cases have been verified, such as the Xiamen Municipal Government's receipt of 1,731 bolts of enemy and puppet woolen fabrics. The results of the investigation revealed that 92 bolts were missing. The missing items are worth approximately tens of millions of dollars. In addition, a certain Mr. Yang, the former director of the Xiamen Municipal Finance Bureau, was found to have received enemy and puppet materials without authorization, and an investigation revealed that many pieces of furniture and goods were missing. Both of the above cases will be transferred to the court for handling. There are also several cases of extortion and malfeasance by receiving personnel, which are serious and complex, and are still under investigation and have not been publicly announced yet.</p>

<h3>Formerly a Prosperous Area; Today Overgrown with Weeds</h3>
<p>Most Houses in Nanchang are Destroyed</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanchang on the 13th] Our reporter inspected the disaster area in Nanchang on the 12th. The northern part of the city, such as Xiaogong Temple and Linggong Temple, used to be a prosperous residential area, but now they are completely destroyed and overgrown with weeds. Before the war, Nanchang had more than 40,000 houses, but only more than 10,000 remained after its liberation last autumn. The destruction rate is approximately 73% or more. The population is now increasing. According to an investigation in August, it has reached 200,000, an increase of about nine-tenths compared to the time of liberation, which has caused a serious housing shortage. Poor citizens are living in tents organized by the Rehabilitation and Relief Administration.</p>
<h3>Rampant Banditry in the Suburbs of Jintan; Security Team's Guns Robbed; Frequent Robberies on Land and Water in Changshu</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Jintan] Jiangzhuangpu in Baitazhen, five kilometers from the city, was attacked by more than fifty bandits late at night on the 7th. The guns of a squad of the county security team stationed in the town were all robbed. Squad leader Qi Yunjun is missing. Jiang Guoying, the head of the township, is suspected of colluding with the bandits and has been taken to the city for interrogation.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Changshu] Robberies on land and water have been occurring frequently here in the past few days. At 11:00 AM on the 11th, five boats from towns such as Ximenwai Zhangmu Bridge, Zhitang, and Taihe passed through the area one after another and were robbed by eight bandits with guns, resulting in a loss of more than 3 million dollars. One passenger, who only had a ring on his finger and no money, was injured by the bandits who beat him with the butt of a gun.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Postpones Closing; Requests Acceptance of Chen Bijun's Assets in Longyou; Discusses Countermeasures for Reducing Land Taxes Again</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou on the 14th] The Zhejiang Provincial Assembly has decided to postpone its closing to the 20th. It also passed a resolution to increase the number of resident committee members to twelve. At the meeting, Senator Yu Shaosong questioned Zhong Pusheng, the director of the Hangzhou Office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, asking him to expedite the acceptance of Chen Ni's Shanzun's Shiliting estate in Longyou. The property was purchased at a low price when Wang Ni was the Premier of the Executive Yuan, and it has not been accepted to this day.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou on the 14th] The Zhejiang Provincial Assembly sent three representatives to Beijing to petition the central government to reduce the land tax. A telegram has now been received stating that the Ministry of Food has agreed to reduce it from 5.67% to 5.5%, but the Provincial Assembly is still not satisfied and has decided to urge the representatives to return to Hangzhou to hold a secret meeting on the 16th to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou on the 14th] In today's Provincial Assembly meeting, senators strongly criticized the Zhejiang Local Bank, accusing it of implementing disguised gold loans, fostering bureaucratic capital, and the general manager using public assets for his own benefit. General Manager Yan had no counter-evidence for the above matters, and he had no specific figures for profits and loans. Therefore, most senators expressed dissatisfaction and ridicule. Some senators also believe that the establishment of administrative inspectors and security commanders in each district is no longer necessary because the war has ended and transportation has been restored. They requested the central government to abolish them in order to facilitate government administration and save expenses. The assembly has handed it over to the review committee for review.</p>

The US loan will also be used to purchase equipment locally and transport it to China. In addition, the Dazhi Hydropower Plant is ready and is scheduled to start generating electricity on the 16th of this month, adding another favorable condition to the economic development of Hubei Province.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from this City] Mr. Hou Jiayuan, the head of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by Engineer Wang Xicheng, went to Hankou to inspect the Yuehan Railway and the Wuhan Bridge, and returned to Shanghai after completing the inspection on the 12th.

The rolling stock equipment is also incomplete. In particular, there is a severe shortage of passenger cars and locomotives. As for the Wuhan Bridge, the Hubei Provincial Government had previously established a construction committee, and Mao, the deputy head of this group, went to participate in the discussion of the traffic policy. This time, he accompanied American engineers Dihmer and Bowman to re-survey the site and determined that the bridge needs to be actively constructed. The bridge is planned to be built in two sections: (1) from Wuzhi Yellow Crane Tower to Hanyang Dongshan (connecting the Yangtze River); (2) from Hanyang to Hankou (connecting the Han River). The total length of the bridge is approximately 11,000 meters, and the estimated cost is approximately 150 billion yuan. In the future, when the bridge is completed, the prosperity of Wuhan will definitely increase.</p>

<h3>The Earth's Landmass is Generally Increasing; Seawater Levels are Lowering, and Temperatures are Getting Colder; Conversation with Dr. Ma Tingying, Chinese Oceanographer</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 14th] Dr. Ma Tingying, a Chinese oceanographer, recently discovered that the landmass on the Earth's surface is generally increasing, while seawater levels are gradually lowering, and seawater temperatures are also gradually getting colder. He is currently the director of the Taiwan Ocean Research Institute and a professor at National Taiwan University. Recently, he went to Penghu, Huoyushao Island, and Suao to collect approximately ten tons of coral and ship-eating mollusk specimens from the oceans in eastern Taiwan Province. He said that the temperature in the deep waters around Penghu has dropped from 13 degrees to about 10 degrees. Many of the corals and pearls around Penghu have been frozen to death. Fish are suffering from colds and typhoid fever due to the cold, and mucus flows from their gills, causing them to become stiff and float on the surface of the sea. Every winter, the fish in the Dongsha Islands float on the surface of the sea, forming a thick layer. Because of the abundance of food, water birds often walk peacefully on the sea to peck at the eyeballs of the fish, resulting in a "fish cannon festival" in the waters of the Dongsha Islands for several months each year. Mr. Ma said that the ocean research in the western Pacific Ocean should be undertaken by us in the future. He believes that Taiwan is surrounded by the sea and is located in a warm and cold exchange zone. The aquatic fish brought by the Kuroshio Current are extremely abundant, and there is still great hope in the next hundred years. He also said that the eastern boundary of Taiwan is the Pacific Ocean, which is more than 2,000 feet deep, while the west is the Taiwan Strait, which is a shallow sea with a depth of only 100 to 200 feet. Therefore, there are many ocean-related problems, which have been regarded as an excellent "battlefield" by the general oceanographic community. He believes that China's research on the ocean is still very backward, and there is currently a lack of talent. After the various specimens collected by Mr. Ma this time are sorted out, they will be classified, printed, and distributed to universities, the fishing industry, and naval authorities for reference. It is also heard that after conducting research around Taiwan, he will depart from the Fujian Sea and collect marine specimens from the North and South Seas to continue conducting field research. He said: If my work is completed, even the Tibet and Xinjiang regions of China can display a set of marine specimens.</p>
<h3>Torpedo Boats Converted into Passenger Ships; Will Sail to Taiwan, Shanghai, and Other Places</h3>

<h3>Byrnes in Paris Seemed Struck by Lightning; Wallace's Speech Caused a Great Disturbance; Vandenberg States the Basic Principles of American Policy</h3>
<p>[News Report] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: Byrnes, Connolly, and Vandenberg, after hearing Wallace's speech in Paris and President Truman's approval of the speech, were "thunderstruck." They believed that after this incident, all the efforts made by the American representatives in Paris against the Soviet Union for the past seven weeks had been in vain. All three, Byrnes, Connolly, and Vandenberg will issue statements. Today, they talked several times with Washington from Paris. Byrnes did not know in advance that President Truman had approved this diplomatic policy speech. When he heard about this, he stood silent for a long time. The American representatives did not deny that President Truman had made a big mistake. One representative said, "The Soviets must be rejoicing tonight."</p>
<p>[News Report] Paris, 14th Broadcast: American Senator Vandenberg expressed his views on Wallace's speech. This is considered a response to Wallace. Vandenberg said: American foreign policy relies entirely on the unity of the United States for support, and Paris is now expressing doubts about this unity. Vandenberg said: For the past eighteen months, the two tendencies of policy divergence have been supported by the common ideas of wartime. Most members of the Republican and Democratic parties were able to unite into a unified American front and face the world. This is the only way to find peace and form collective security. Those who abandon this path will harm the goals we have already announced. I am sure that most Republicans will still be happy to seek unity with the government and stand on the basic principles of the United States to implement our foreign policy, without taking the dictatorship of any party, without being hostile or surrendering to other countries, and safeguarding human rights and basic freedoms. However, for so-called unity, we must also seek it within the government agencies themselves. Vandenberg also said: We can only cooperate with one Secretary of State at a time. The political views expressed by Wallace seem to be very different from those followed by Secretary of State Byrnes in Paris.</p>
<p>[News Report] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: Acting Secretary of State Clayton stated at a press conference yesterday that part of Commerce Secretary Wallace's speech was far from the American foreign policy announced by Secretary of State Byrnes. Clayton said that Byrnes's recent statement is still sufficient to represent American policy. When answering questions, Clayton said that he had not received orders to change American foreign policy to match Wallace's speech. Some sources say that the intention of Wallace's speech is that he favors dividing the world into spheres of influence of great powers and abandoning the United States' efforts to restore the Potsdam promise to the people of Eastern Europe. Byrnes opposed this kind of sphere of influence in a speech this spring. Congress has had different reactions to Wallace's speech. At the same time, non-official observers also believe that Wallace's speech conflicts with the American foreign policy elucidated by Byrnes.</p>
<p>Two Factions Advocate Going Their Separate Ways</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] From the current internal situation, two trends are becoming increasingly obvious: (1) Truman now has two foreign policies in his hands that are diverging. One is advocated by the Secretary of Commerce (the only remaining member of the late President Roosevelt's cabinet), and the other is promoted by the Secretary of State. Truman's position can strongly support both foreign policies. (2) Senior officials do not actually want Wallace to change the United States' policy toward the Soviet Union, but it remains to be seen where to go and what to do. Truman needs to make another public statement before the situation can be completely clarified.</p>
<p>Wallace and Byrnes have remained silent about this storm, but several leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties have severely criticized Wallace's speech and the situation it has caused. According to Republican Senator Taft, the president's approval of Wallace's speech is "selling out his Secretary of State." Democratic Congressman Ross wired Truman, saying that approving Wallace's speech is "removing Byrnes's bottom plate and alarming the United States."</p>
<p>Following an Independent Diplomatic Path</p>
<p>Diplomatic circles analyzed the original text of Wallace's speech and found three points that were inconsistent with the current American foreign policy outline: (1) Although Byrnes has repeatedly solemnly denied the existence of a British-American anti-Soviet group, London and Washington have completely parallel policies in dealing with political problems in the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean. The most important decision made by both parties is to oppose the Soviet Union's military expansion in the Turkish Straits. Wallace's intention is to split the American foreign policy from the British imperialist policy because of this parallel diplomatic action. Wallace did not explain, but diplomatic observers believe that this is the only possibility. (2) For several months, the basic attitude of the United States on all major issues concerning the Soviet Union is that the United States will never compromise on any issues involving American principles and interests. Wallace's statement that being tough on the Soviet Union is of no use probably refers to this. (3) American policy is based on opposing the division of the world into spheres of influence, while Wallace advocates that the United States should not interfere in Eastern European politics. The Soviet Union does not ask about Latin America and Western Europe.</p>
<p>As for President Truman's statement that Byrnes's policy has not changed, he has substantially revised his attitude in favor of Wallace's speech, because the president will fully support Byrnes's foreign policy. There is currently no indication that the president's support of Wallace's speech represents a major change in the United States' relationship with Britain or the Soviet Union. Generally, the president wants to make people believe that under his and Byrnes's leadership, the United States is following a completely independent foreign policy, neither pro-Soviet nor anti-Soviet.</p>
<h3>Wallace's Speech Has Ulterior Motives</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 13th] Diplomatic sources say that Wallace's speech had ulterior motives. His purpose was to win the hearts of voters so that he could play an important role on the political stage after the 1948 presidential election, but his friendly attitude towards the Soviet Union has been repeatedly attacked. Wallace's speech is sufficient to be called an outline of a completely new policy, acknowledging that today's world is divided into two major spheres of influence, and China is still outside these two major spheres of influence, but only open to worldwide commercial competition. In addition, some government officials believe that because some conflicts of interest between Britain and the Soviet Union are unavoidable, it is extremely difficult to draw a clear line of demarcation between the spheres of influence of the United States and the Soviet Union so that they do not interfere with each other.</p>

<h3>The Antagonism Between the Two Blocs Becomes More Obvious; Many Disputes at the Paris Peace Conference; The Head of the British Delegation, Alexander, Returns Home</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The head of the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, flew back here from Paris this morning. Lord Alexander denied reports that he had stormed out of the military committee meeting of the peace conference, claiming: "I did not slam the door and leave; I was merely leaving the meeting place to prepare for my departure from Paris."</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 13th] Heated arguments occurred in two committees of the peace conference, leading to the British representative storming out of the meeting, and another Soviet chairman quietly leaving the meeting amid a public uproar, resulting in a motion of no confidence being proposed. Earlier, in the military committee, the British representative, Alexander, vehemently argued with the Soviet representative, Slavine, regarding Albania's right to express its opinion on the military clauses of the Italian peace treaty, and then stormed out of the meeting. In the political committee of the peace conference, the chairman of the Byelorussian SSR, Kiselev, refused to express a decision on a British proposal and declared an adjournment, causing an uproar in the meeting place. The U.S. representative, Caffery, objected to the chairman's declaration of adjournment, but Chairman Kiselev quietly left the meeting. Afterwards, eight out of the thirteen committee members unusually passed a motion of no confidence in Kiselev, declaring his adjournment improper. The dispute arose because of a Greek amendment requesting the correction of the Greek-Albanian border under conditions favorable to Greece. The Soviet representative objected, arguing that the amendment was submitted after the August 20th deadline and should not be discussed in the committee. The British representative, Warner, proposed putting to a vote whether the Greek amendment should be discussed in the committee or the peace conference, at which point Chairman Kiselev suddenly declared an adjournment.</p>

<h3>The "Thirteen" Club</h3>
<p>A New American Anti-Superstition Organization</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 14th] Americans often avoid the number thirteen, considering it unlucky. Some people with a penchant for mischief want to mock this superstitious idea, so they have organized the "Thirteen Club" to promote the number thirteen. The club met on the thirteenth day on 13th Street in New York. Members walked up thirteen steps, thirteen people sat at one table, and used the same match to light cigarettes thirteen times.

<h3>The City Council: Reports from Various Bureaus Completed; Dissatisfaction with the Current State of Education Leads to Intense Questioning; The Mayor's Proposal to Extend Daylight Saving Time Is Rejected; A Full Review Meeting Will Be Held Today</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The administrative reports from the city government's various bureaus were all completed at yesterday's city council meeting. The ninth meeting yesterday morning was a report from the Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, Li Ximou, and the afternoon session was a report from the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian. The councilors questioned the Education Bureau Director, with the issue of excessive tuition increases being the most notable. Councilors questioned the Social Affairs Bureau on labor issues, such as providing relief to unemployed workers and organizing labor welfare programs. The two directors answered these questions. The verbal questioning of the Social Affairs Bureau may continue at the next general meeting.</p>
<p>During yesterday's meeting, the following were discussed and resolved: the election of five representatives to participate in the inspection team, the decision on five members of the drafting committee for the City Council Declaration, and changes to the agenda. In addition, the Mayor's proposal to extend daylight saving time to the end of October to alleviate the electricity crisis was not passed by the meeting.</p>
<p>The City Council's agenda was slightly changed by the general meeting yesterday due to the temporary decision to invite representatives from the Executive Yuan's agencies to attend and report. This morning there will be a full budget review meeting, and the ninth group will independently review the budget in the afternoon. Tomorrow morning at the eleventh meeting, in addition to discussing proposals, the Committee for the Allocation of Housing to Shanghai Agencies under the Executive Yuan will be invited to attend and report on the allocation of housing. The twelfth meeting on the morning of the 16th will be changed to the third review meeting, and the meeting on the morning of the 17th will be changed to the twelfth meeting, with a report from the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA).</p>
<h3>Li Ximou Reports on Education: Expresses Hope that Municipal Schools Can Avoid Becoming Bureaucratic Organizations</h3>
<p>The Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, Li Ximou, gave a report at the ninth meeting of the council, stating: The focus of this year's work is: 1. To promote national education and establish more municipal schools. 2. To prepare for the establishment of secondary education districts and promote vocational education. 3. To expand social education and strengthen the mass literacy movement. 4. To implement district supervision and strict enforcement. 5. To establish science and labor centers to concentrate training in order to supplement the insufficient funding of various schools.</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty at present is the lack of school buildings. If the ten districts raise funds to establish schools, it would be a good example to follow. Furthermore, the allocation of municipal schools is not balanced, and there are significant differences in the number of municipal schools in each district. The general shortcomings of schools in the city are the lack of library books and equipment, insufficient cleanliness, hygiene, and health education, and the lack of domestic science training in girls' schools. The Education Bureau hopes that municipal schools can avoid becoming institutionalized and bureaucratic and that there should not be too many staff members. Secondly, it is hoped that school authorities can cooperate with students' parents to form parent committees to solve various difficulties.</p>
<p>Supplementary Report: Regarding private school fees, we have considered them for a long time, and the Ministry of Education also has orders, hoping to be lenient with the fees of various schools. Therefore, the Education Bureau does not restrict the fees of private schools but stipulates that there should be a 20% quota for free students. As for the fees charged by municipal schools, they are used to expand the number of classes.</p>
<p>Regarding the Education Fund, Mayor Qian promised 1 billion yuan, but as of the end of May this year, only 500 million yuan has been received. It has not yet been withdrawn from the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The total amount originally set for the Respect Teachers Movement was 1 billion yuan, and the current amount received is over 88.7 million yuan. This has been audited and verified by the Lixin Accounting Firm. The donation for respecting teachers has received enthusiastic assistance from all sectors of society, with the textile industry providing even more help. Payment items include: 49.419 million yuan paid to municipal school teachers, 20.619 million yuan paid to private school teachers, and an additional 20 million yuan subsidized by the city government, for a total expenditure of 81.7414 million yuan. Because the universities raised 4.965 million yuan, which they will manage themselves, there is still 6.9203 million yuan remaining, which is planned to be distributed to private school teachers or incorporated into the Education Fund.</p>

The council allowed the union representatives to go upstairs to listen to the meeting. Later, during his report, Director Wu specifically mentioned the hotels' request to abolish price controls and restore small accounts and made it clear that the government had refused to restore the small account system.</p>
<h3>The Selection of Members of the Drafting Committee for the City Council's Closing Declaration Is Decided</h3>
<p>The City Council passed a resolution yesterday to issue a declaration to the citizens of the city before the closing ceremony scheduled for the afternoon of the 21st of this month. Speaker Pan proposed the election of a drafting committee, and the meeting decided to elect five members.

<h3>Private School Fees Are Too High, Parents Cannot Afford Them; Furthermore, There Are Corrupt Practices of "Examination Escort Teams" Helping Students Cheat; Councilors Question Extensively</h3>
<p>After the Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, Li Ximou, completed his administrative report, the questioning began. The councilors criticized the lack of restrictions on private school fees in the city, and the accusations were quite severe. Jiang Huaisu fired the first shot, calling it a painful statement, not a fatigue bombing. Although the Ministry of Education ordered the fees of various schools to be relaxed, it did not mean they should be left unregulated, but the Education Bureau, after detailed consideration, did not impose any restrictions, so that parents cannot afford them. Before the war, elementary school tuition was 4 to 14 yuan, and even if multiplied by 5,000, it would only be 20,000 to 70,000 yuan. Currently, elementary schools charge 60,000 to 120,000 yuan, which far exceeds the pre-war standard. How can this be considered fair and reasonable? Deputy Director Li replied: The Education Bureau is also dissatisfied with the current tuition fees of various private schools, but the Education Bureau and the mayor have spoken with the authorities of various private schools, and the situation is very difficult, and there is a lack of a method that can satisfy everyone. Although the Education Bureau does not restrict the fees of private schools, it stipulates that each school must have a 20% quota for free students to accommodate poor children. At this time, Lu Yinchu stood up and said: Tuition fees should be restricted, and several councilors applauded. More councilors criticized the Education Bureau for being irresponsible and firmly demanded that school fees be restricted.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Li repeatedly replied: The decision has already been made not to restrict tuition fees at present. Changing it would be difficult and hard to implement. If the council decides that school fees should be restricted, the Education Bureau will follow suit in the future. Mayor Wu, seeing that the councilors were paying close attention to the issue of tuition fees, explained the matter, saying: There are currently two problems: 1. Schools cannot fully accommodate school-age children. 2. School fees are too high. These two points seem unrelated, but in fact, they are closely related. Various private schools have held joint meetings and made decisions on fees, and the Ministry of Education has also given instructions. If the Education Bureau strictly restricts fees, private schools may not be able to operate, making it even more difficult for school-age children. The city government has convened a meeting of principals and strictly ordered that elementary schools must have a 20% free quota and secondary schools must have a 15% free quota. School funds are deposited in banks, and interest is calculated together. After the school opens, it will report the entire budget to the Education Bureau, which will send supervisors to strictly check whether the income and expenditure are in compliance, whether the treatment is excessive, whether the expenses are transparent, and whether school funds have been misappropriated privately. At the same time, it is hoped that the council will pay special attention when reviewing education funds and see if they can be increased. However, according to Wang Weizhe, who told reporters that the Education Bureau's allocation of funds is not clearly defined, making it difficult to review the budget.</p>
<p>Regarding other questions to the Education Bureau, Deputy Director Li briefly answered as follows due to time constraints: Rural supplementary schools are being actively prepared. Regarding the abolition of entrance examinations, in the future, graduates of municipal schools may not have to participate in entrance examinations and can directly enter school, but internal school examinations must be strictly conducted. There are "examination escort teams" in various schools who help students cheat. We hope that schools will automatically correct this. We plan to ask party groups to assist in organizing the literacy movement committee. Private schools can be changed to municipal schools after investigation. To rectify the school spirit, district supervision will be adopted. To rectify the teaching staff, teacher assessments will be conducted, and short-term teacher training will be implemented.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau's Administrative Report: Resolving Labor-Management Disputes Proceeds Smoothly</h3>
<p>When the speaker announced that Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau would give his report, the councilors gave him enthusiastic applause. After Director Wu took the stage, he first reported on food administration, saying that food prices soared in May of this year. The bureau took emergency measures to register grain reserves, strictly prohibit the manipulation of illegal rice merchants, and with the assistance of the Ministry of Food, transported rice from Sichuan and Jiangxi to Shanghai, thus averting the crisis. This year's harvest has been plentiful in various places, and new rice has already entered the market. In order to stabilize food prices, the government is maintaining a level of 40,000 yuan per stone. The Food Section of the bureau only manages administration, and it does not handle rice, grain, or funds. Mediation of labor-management disputes is one of the bureau's heavy tasks. At the end of last year, strikes and work slowdowns occurred frequently. The bureau mediated labor-management disputes in accordance with the four principles of the Ministry of Social Affairs: (1) protect the legitimate interests of workers, (2) rectify labor discipline, (3) all negotiations should follow legal procedures, and (4) do not change the base salary or the methods and opinions put forward by the municipal government and the municipal chamber of commerce. The highest peak of labor unrest in the city was in March of this year, with 54 strikes and work slowdowns throughout the month. By the time statistics were compiled in August, none had occurred. The reasons for the elimination of labor unrest are nothing more than (1) the effectiveness of the union leaders, (2) the workers' understanding of the current crisis in industry and commerce, and not making excessive demands, and (3) the government's determination to eliminate labor unrest and stabilize the industrial sector. The district union system at that time was the root of labor unrest. Now, with the assistance of the industrial sector, the bureau is smoothly promoting the reform of the district union system into a factory union system. The Labor-Management Arbitration Committee's resolution of the knitting industry in districts 1, 2, and 3 to reduce wages and pay according to 85% of the cost of living index was a major achievement. Director Wu also reported that the budget for welfare and charitable undertakings was originally 800 million yuan, but so far, the actual amount received is only 80 million yuan. In view of the city government's financial difficulties, the Social Affairs Bureau requested the Executive Yuan to allocate a special fund of 900 million yuan, which was approved, but it was allocated by the Executive Headquarters of UNRRA, and because the Executive Headquarters of UNRRA had no funds, no money has been received to date. The lack of funds and housing is one of the reasons why welfare and charitable undertakings cannot be further expanded. Finally, Wu gave a supplementary report on the large number of private banks applying to resume business and the two principles of the Ministry of Finance. The price controls for the hotel and theater industries have been abolished, but hotels are absolutely not allowed to restore small accounts. In the future, the allocation of household sugar will be managed by the Civil Affairs Department.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Meeting</h3>
<p>The council meeting has been going on for six days, with daily trips to and from Yiyuan [a nearby garden]. Not only are newspaper reporters yawning at the meeting, but even the councilors are feeling exhausted. The councilors enter and leave the meeting, each carrying several bags of paper, like students going to school. The councilors themselves also say: "We're going to class!"</p>
<p>Yesterday, after Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau answered verbal inquiries, because there was not enough time for further inquiries, it was proposed to use written questions in the future, but some people still wanted to ask verbally again. Qu Yue expressed his disagreement, saying: "During verbal inquiries, the questioning will go all over the place, like a tram without rails."</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the gallery on the second floor of the council meeting created the liveliest scene since the meeting began. It turned out that hotel employees had come to the meeting to petition, and because what the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau reported and the points questioned by the councilors were closely related to them, they listened with great interest and looked very nervous until they left the meeting at the end.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works will host a visit to the beach embankment project in Pudong for councilors at 8:00 a.m. today, but the agenda for this morning has already been decided to convene a full budget review meeting. The speaker is afraid that all the councilors will run away, and there will be too few people at the meeting, so he specifically reminded everyone.</p>
<p>When electing the representatives to participate in the inspection team, Chu Shiyung [presumably Water, not Chu] voluntarily withdrew because he had served as the recipient of the postal workers' union. Lu Yinchu was a little uneasy and asked if anyone could prove it, otherwise it must be "laziness"!</p>
<p>Jiang Huaisu spoke up for a college student, asking the Deputy Director of the Education Bureau: A college student joined the air force to save the country, so he didn't have time to complete the school leaving procedures, and now he wants to return to school but is not allowed. "Which is more important, saving the country or completing school leaving procedures?"</p>
<p>When Zhu Xuefan questioned the Social Affairs Bureau, there was applause to accompany him on and off the stage. The level of support he received was rare in recent days.</p>
<p>Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau has another talent in answering questions, often asking the council for help, which is moving to hear.</p>
<p>The only female councilor who took the stage to speak yesterday was Tang Guifen, who questioned the Social Affairs Bureau on three points, all of which were women's issues, and she was particularly concerned about the welfare of female workers, showing that she is a representative of working women.</p>
<h3>Participation in the Investigation Team: Zhao Junhao and Five Others Elected as Representatives</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the council elected five representatives to participate in the investigation team. The results were Wang Xianqing (91 votes), Zhao Junhao (87 votes), He Yuanming (86 votes), Shui Xiangyun (52 votes), and Wang Jian'e (45 votes) being elected. However, Wang Xianqing, having participated in the takeover of the municipal chamber of commerce, and Shui Xiangyun, having participated in the takeover of the postal workers' union, voluntarily requested to withdraw. They were replaced by the next highest vote-getters, Zhu Xuefan (38 votes) and Ma Junshuo (36 votes). Zhan Wenhuan proposed that the assembly pay a certain amount of travel expenses to each representative, and it was resolved that the speaker and deputy speaker should determine the amount. Feng Youzhen proposed that the assembly publicly announce to the citizens' council that it had elected councilors to participate in the investigation team, solicit the opinions of citizens on the receiving agencies, and assist in reporting corrupt practices in the takeover, with confidential letters to be sent directly to the council. The resolution was passed. Finally, Speaker Pan reiterated that the work of the investigation team would be based on a collegial system, and that all cases would be handled by the head of the investigation team, all committee members, and representatives of the council through joint deliberation.</p>
<p>According to He Yuanming, one of the representatives, in an interview with a reporter: The investigation work is extremely difficult and will require a considerable amount of time. The catalog of receiving agencies alone fills several boxes. However, the representatives all hope to achieve two things: "Conduct a fair investigation and live up to public expectations." After receiving a response from the investigation team, the five councilors will hold a small group meeting to discuss a plan of action, and if necessary, will request the investigation team to extend the time allotted for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Unhealthy Publications and Vagrants to be Implemented Gradually: Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, Responds to Inquiries</h3>
<p>After Director Wu finished his report, the chairman announced a ten-minute recess, followed by various councilors raising oral inquiries. First, Councilor Zhao Yangxiong spoke, asking how the Social Affairs Bureau could thoroughly eliminate unhealthy children's reading materials on the streets. Councilor Zhang Zhusan then inquired about three issues: why the labor welfare fund was not being implemented according to law, how to provide education for the children of laborers, and whether the Labor Hospital in West Shanghai should be taken over by the government. Councilor Zhu Xuefan raised three points based on newspaper reports: (1) Factories falsely accuse laborers, and union personnel are arrested; the council should effectively protect unions in the future and no longer arbitrarily detain people. (2) After a union is formally established, the appointed instructors should be immediately withdrawn and should no longer be renamed as advisors to continue their existence. (3) How should unemployed workers be relieved, especially unemployed workers coming from the rear; efforts should be made quickly to find relief methods. Next, the only female councilor who spoke yesterday, Tang Guifen, raised three issues related to women: (1) After the prohibition of prostitution, prostitutes should be given a way out. (2) The Jiliang Institute should be established as soon as possible. (3) Female workers who miscarry receive only half of their wages during the maternity leave period, which is extremely unreasonable and should be revised. After Councilor Ke finished his inquiries, Speaker Pan announced a temporary suspension of inquiries and asked Director Wu to respond first.</p>
<p>Director Wu answered in order: The Social Affairs Bureau's responsible department is in charge of examining unhealthy reading materials in bookstores, but there are also cases of private publications that violate the examination regulations. The bureau has worked with the police局 to strictly ban lewd and obscene picture books, and the ban on square yellow publications is also strict. Warnings have been issued separately to the publishers. The capacity of refugee and children's shelters has already been saturated. Although the Social Affairs Bureau intends to eliminate vagrants throughout the city, it is limited by certain facts, resulting in a situation where the will is there, but the strength is lacking. In the future, after financial and material resources are sufficient, it will be implemented gradually. The reason why welfare has not been universally implemented is that the business community is too depressed. If the situation improves, the welfare ordinance will be implemented. The Labor Hospital has a history of more than ten years and has a board of directors. It is not convenient for the government to take it over arbitrarily. If it is not managed well, the government can supervise it to improve. As for factories falsely accusing workers, if illegal situations are encountered, they can be resolved through judicial channels in the court. The Social Affairs Bureau should be responsible for the union and union officials and will definitely guarantee their protection. Relieving unemployed workers is something that should be done, but the relief of unemployed workers coming to Shanghai from the rear is beyond the ability of the local government and should be the responsibility of the central government. Currently, the repaired Gongda Yarn Factory, which was bombed, is being used to house unemployed workers from the rear, with food provided by the Executive Yuan Relief Administration. After a union is established, instructors should indeed be withdrawn. If there are still unwithdrawn instructors, the bureau can be notified for investigation. In response to Ms. Tang's inquiries, Director Wu said: The Caohejing shelter has also taken in some prostitutes, but management is extremely difficult. The Jiliang Institute should be established as soon as possible and experts should be hired to preside over it. Opinions on wages during the miscarriage period of female workers can be sent to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Social Affairs for use as information when revising the Labor Law. After Director Wu finished his answers, Speaker Pan temporarily suspended inquiries because there were other important cases to discuss. However, Councilor Fan Xichang further asked whether instructors must be filled by Social Affairs Bureau staff. Director Wu replied: There are more than 300 unions in the city, and the staff of the Social Affairs Bureau cannot be allocated, so they can also be hired from other places. Anyone who has experience in popular movements can be appointed. At this point, inquiries were stopped, and proposals were discussed.</p>

<h3>Land Registration Deadline is Today, Open for Business as Usual Despite Sunday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Director of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, Zhu Ping, is striving to simplify procedures and increase work efficiency for land registration. Therefore, businesses are actively applying for registration recently.

<h3>Wu Xin is Actually Enemy Agent Zhang Xiaolong; Li Lihua's Confrontation May Be Cancelled</h3>
<p>It is rumored that the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command is handling the case of Wu Xin, suspected of being an economic traitor, and because it involves Hua Ying actress Li Lihua, a summons was issued on the 13th, ordering Li Lihua to appear in court on the 14th for questioning. It is reported that Wu Xin is the alias of Zhang Xiaolong, a well-known enemy agent in Shanghai. During his time in the puppet regime, Zhang engaged in extortion and committed all kinds of evils. After the victory, he hid in Nanjing in an attempt to escape punishment, but was arrested by the Logistics Headquarters in Nanjing and interrogated by the Military Law Office of the headquarters. According to Zhang, he rescued many patriotic people in Shanghai, including Li Lihua, who was arrested by the enemy's gendarmerie. Therefore, the Logistics Headquarters telegraphed the municipal Garrison Command, requesting that Li Lihua be summoned for confrontation. Because Li has left Shanghai, the Garrison Command stated that the matter is not important and it is hoped that it will be cancelled. It is untrue that Wu Xin is being tried by the Garrison Command.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Women's New Life Movement Promotion Association Holds Fourth General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's New Life Movement Promotion Association held its fourth general meeting yesterday. Those present included Mayor Wu's wife, Huang Zhuoqun, Committee Member Qian Jianqiu, Zhang Wenxiang, Lu Lihua, and about 60 other women from various fields. The association was founded in 1938 by Madame Yu Hongjun and has a history of nine years. Its purpose is to promote the New Life Movement. During the August 13th Incident, it organized rescue teams to serve the wounded soldiers and promoted relief and education work. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Qian Jianqiu and others convened the members to restore the association's affairs. A members' meeting was held in December last year to discuss work, and voluntary schools were set up to assist poor and sick women. After the meeting yesterday, Ms. Zhang Wenxiang first reported on the association's work, followed by speeches by Mayor Wu's wife, Ms. Qian Jianqiu, and Ms. Lu Lihua. They all believed that promoting women's work was not easy, but it should start from small things. The New Life Movement should be generated in every family and then extended to every corner of society so that it would not become empty. They encouraged the members to continue to move forward with the spirit of service. Finally, the entire group unanimously elected Mayor Wu's wife as the chairman of the association, followed by the election of directors and supervisors, the revision of the constitution, and the discussion of proposals. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Hotel Closes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Sino-American Hotel at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chengdu Road has recently announced its closure due to sluggish business and excessive losses, starting yesterday. The hotel was organized in June of this year by Chen Yuqiao, Li Guangyao, Xu Yikang, Yu Guoliang, Han Zhiling, and others, with a capital of 120 million yuan in legal currency. Xu Yikang also served as general manager. The night before last, checks issued by the hotel, totaling more than 10 million yuan, were returned due to insufficient funds. The special bill holders Wang Qinggeng, Xiang Rensheng, Han Yongfu, Zhao Jinzhi, Chen Linjiang, etc., reported to the Xincheng Police Sub局 after failing to cash them at the hotel. After questioning the hotel manager Chuan Songling and deputy manager Han Bingjun, they were released on bail. It is reported that the hotel's general manager, Xu Yikang, is avoiding meetings, and the board of directors has hired a lawyer to announce the liquidation.</p>
<h3>Merchant Chen Shuding and Others Accused of Fraud; Three Paper Warehouse Receipts are Not Genuine</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The court yesterday heard a major fraud case. Cotton merchant Chen Shuding repeatedly borrowed money from Wang Qifu. In June of this year, in the name of Tailai and Runfeng Yarn and Flower Company, he successively issued seven checks from the Daya Bank, totaling 12,558 million yuan, to repay the debt, but all were returned by the bank due to insufficient funds. Wang approached Chen for negotiations, but Chen avoided meeting and repeatedly delayed. Later, in order to show his ability to repay the debt, Chen colluded with the second defendant, Wu Daonan, to give Wang three warehouse receipts for packaged raw cotton owned by the fictitious Hefeng Enterprise Company, totaling 660 bales, valued at more than 50 million yuan, as collateral. When Wang went to pick up the goods, he discovered that they were all waste cotton. Therefore, he filed a complaint in the court, accusing them of fraud. After the court investigated yesterday, it ordered a rescheduling for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Attempt to Sell Black Market Sugar; Fusheng South Goods Store Offers Bribe</h3>
<p>At 6:00 a.m. on the 12th, the Hongkou Police Sub局 received a confidential tip that "Fusheng South Goods Store on Wusong Road is transporting 24 bags of white sugar, worth more than 7 million yuan, in a truck, intending to sell them at black market prices." After receiving the report, the 局 immediately dispatched two police officers, numbers 1240 and 3321, to investigate. The store manager, Zhang Songze, appeared panicked and offered the two police officers 2 million yuan in national currency as a bribe, asking for "help." The two police officers believed that the manager's behavior was an insult to the police and reported the details to their superiors. After receiving the report, Sub局 Director Wang ordered the criminal section to seize all the white sugar and the manager Zhang Songze for thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes by the Racetrack: A Page of Foreigners' History of Encroachment</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by This Newspaper] Although the issue of horse racing and racetracks has not yet been formally discussed in the Municipal Council's general assembly, the extent of attention and debate among councilors and citizens regarding these two issues in recent days can be described as feverish.</p>
<p>Attention is being paid, and discussions are taking place, but before we make a decision on this matter, we must understand the truth of the matter. Regarding whether Shanghai should continue to have horse racing, we can decide based on public opinion. What this report will continue to cover is the issue of racetrack property rights, which also involves its history.</p>
<p>For this matter, the reporter specially consulted Councilor Chen Cunren, a standing director of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association, who is a disciple of Yao Gonghe, an expert on old Shanghai issues. Therefore, he has a deep understanding of various aspects of Shanghai's history. Historical data on the racetrack is now very scarce. Mr. Chen Cunren spent a lot of valuable time searching through various historical materials and found the following complete story:</p>
<p>An Englishman's Horse, Two Lines of Farmers' Tears</p>
<p>The current racetrack is actually the third one operated by foreigners. As early as 1850 (the 30th year of the Qing Dynasty's Daoguang Emperor), four English directors opened a fairly large open space at the original site of the Nanjing Road ball court, now the site of Lihua Company, for playing billiards and throwing balls, hence the name "ball court." At that time, the Shanghai Daotai (local official) and the British Consul, according to the Yangjingbang Regulations (i.e., the lease agreement), stipulated that each mu (unit of land area) could be purchased for fifteen thousand cash. At that time, the area west of the ball court was all wasteland, devoid of human habitation. In 1854 (the fourth year of the Xianfeng Emperor), the directors of the ball court sold all the land and developed further west, opening a "New Park and Racetrack" in the area around the current Wing On and Sincere department stores. The land area was very large, bordered by Hubei Road, Zhejiang Road, Zhifu Road, and Beihai Road. Later, this area gradually became prosperous. Then, in 1860 (the tenth year of the Xianfeng Emperor), they sold all the real estate at a high price. At this time, the "Battle of Mud City" occurred in Shanghai, which was a conflict between the Small Swords Society and British soldiers at the South Mud City Bridge. The battlefield was north of the South Mud City Bridge, in the area of the New World amusement center. At this time, the entire Sichuan Road was a creek called "Zhoujingbang," and on one side was a foreign creek (i.e., the old Avenue Edward VII). The British army stationed troops on a piece of land west of the Zhoujingbang. At that time, China was in the midst of the Taiping Rebellion, and the imperial court did not pay much attention to this banditry case. As a result, the Small Swords Society declared defeat, and after the troops retreated, the British announced the purchase of land west of Zhoujiabang (Xizang Road) as a new racetrack. The British used a horse, starting from the South Mud City Bridge on Xizang Road (the entrance to the New World), and then went west and south through Luhua Tang (i.e., the current Ma Zhai Road), circling a large area until the intersection of Zhoujing Yangjingbang at the original site of the Eastern Hotel. At each point along the way, wooden markers were erected, and ropes were used to enclose the area. This circle became the current racetrack, covering a total area of 430 mu. However, this circle was entirely composed of Chinese farmers' farmland and ancestral graves. There is no doubt that this was an act of forceful occupation. This was in 1862 (the first year of the Tongzhi Emperor). They then began to force the farmers to sell their land, still at fifteen thousand cash per mu. Many compradors and local guarantors "scraped the land" in the middle, enriching themselves with an unknown amount of silver dollars. After the British forcibly occupied the land, they divided the field into inner and outer circles. However, many disputes also arose. Most of the people refused to sell, and the ancestral graves were unwilling to be moved. Recently, Chen Cunren visited Zhao Jinqing, a prominent figure in Shanghai. It is said that the Zhao family had a twenty-mu cemetery dating back five generations. The local guarantor, who was in charge of moving the graves and the relocation fees, only gave him fifty thousand cash, which he refused to accept. In addition, there is a story to tell: there is still a stone archway in the racetrack, and people suspect that it belongs to the Zhao Jinqing family, and some say that it was built by the Zhang family. In fact, these are all unreliable. This archway was erected by "Zhao, the wife of Xu Yuanlai," and was built in the 53rd year of Qianlong. When Zhao was twenty-three years old, her husband died, and Zhao guarded her chastity and raised her adopted son. She died at the age of eighty-three. The archway is called "Jingjie Archway" (Archway of Chaste Fidelity), and foreigners call it "Widow's Honor Archway." Because the Xu family was very powerful in the area, this archway was not demolished.</p>
<p>Enclosing Land and Reselling It: Foreigners Make a Fortune</p>
<p>After the racetrack was enclosed, the farmers inside the circle were all driven out, and Chinese people were absolutely forbidden to enter. The original landowners were beaten out if they entered. Only a very small number of Chinese people wearing Western suits could occasionally enter accompanied by foreigners. However, the stubborn and violent imperialist forces at that time could not subdue the anger of the people. The people inside the circle protested en masse because their private land was occupied by foreigners, the racetrack changed locations twice and made two big fortunes, and the compradors and local guarantors committed great fraud. The Shanghai Daotai was unable to deal with it and had to exchange documents (i.e., notes) with the British Consul. The document stipulated: "This land, after being purchased, shall be used exclusively for horse racing and playing ball, and shall never be sold or allowed to build other houses unrelated to horse racing and playing ball, or rented or sold." Because of this exchange of documents, the racetrack could no longer repeatedly sell and enclose land. According to Fang Jisheng's History of Shanghai, when the second racetrack (where Sincere and Wing On department stores were located) was sold in 1862, it obtained 49,425 taels of silver. However, when purchasing the current Ma Huo Road racetrack, it only cost 12,500 taels of silver to purchase 430 mu of vast farmland. What an amazing way for Westerners to make a fortune!</p>
<p>In fact, there are 325 property owners in the racetrack, of which only 205 have received payment. The other 120 households firmly refuse to go to receive payment. In 1895 (the 21st year of the Guangxu Emperor), the property owners could no longer bear it and specially hired a British lawyer to file a lawsuit with the consulate. As a result, the British directors were ordered to compensate each property owner with ten taels of silver. However, these 120 households were still unwilling to receive the money. The remaining 1,200 taels were used, with 400 taels as lawyer's fees and 800 taels sent by the British Consul to the Shanghai County Yamen (government office), which posted a notice saying: "We hope that each property owner will come to receive the money. If they still do not come to receive it within three months, it shall be deemed invalid." In the end, didn't that money end up in the pockets of the Yamen officials!</p>
<p>But the property owners still refused to accept it. In the 25th year of Guangxu, when the concession was expanded, the British came up with a good idea, which was to invite some of the old landowners to be grooms at the racetrack. On the one hand, they were also allowed to build wooden temporary stands along the Xiaobang (small creek, recently filled in) on Jing'an Temple Road, stretching from the New World all the way to Ma Huo Road. Those stands were made of a few wooden planks placed on long benches, and a few copper coins were charged for people to watch. The Public Works Department did not collect taxes from them and did not require any permits, which was considered preferential treatment for them. Because Chinese people were still not allowed to step into the inner circle at that time, the business of the stands outside the circle was not bad.</p>
<p>By the first year of Xuantong, the British suddenly changed their plan and opened up the inner circle to Chinese people for ticket purchase. As a result, the stands outside the circle gradually disappeared because the business was sluggish and because of inconvenient transportation after many years.</p>
<p>At that time, the stands inside the circle were also very simple. The old stands were demolished in 1933. On February 28, 1934 (the 23rd year of the Republic of China), the new clock tower building was completed. The above is the story of the racetrack.</p>
<p>To Race or Not to Race: Everyone Has a Different Opinion</p>
<p>Next, we want to talk about the land rights issue of the Shanghai Race Club. The current property owners of the racetrack are related. From the perspective of the Race Club, all members of the club have the right to race. Even if the Municipal Council opposes horse racing, I believe they will still "race." What are the reasons for this? There are mainly three points that they can raise: (1) The club itself has the right to race; (2) Horse racing has athletic qualities (non-members cannot race); (3) The racetrack is private property that is difficult to distinguish from public property. Therefore, the resolution of the last temporary council to rebuild the park, etc., could not be achieved.</p>
<p>So, what is a reasonable way to solve the problem? According to Councilor Chen's observation, the first is: All land should be requisitioned in accordance with the Land Law. According to this law, even legal scholars like Fan Ke cannot refuse (but there is not that much money). Second: The cost of requisitioning land is huge. The ideal way must be for the Municipal Council to organize a special committee to seriously study and draft a plan. However, in principle, it may be based on two points: (1) Imitate the Greater Shanghai Plan and re-raise bonds for organization and implementation. If the mayor plans to extract 20% of the savings fund within two years, this is impossible in fact. If calculated at a monthly collection of 500 million yuan, only 12 billion yuan can be collected in two years. This small amount is not even enough to buy a small piece of land for the horse stable. Even if we race day and night, racing for ten years will not help much. However, Mayor Wu's use of diplomatic skills also has unexpected possibilities, because the property rights of the racetrack have changed back and forth between public and private for ninety-six years. It is not clear what is going on. However, it is essential for the Municipal Council to organize a special committee to search documents, interview old landowners, and study methods (2) According to the regulations of the Race Club, "Horse racing has athletic qualities, and non-members cannot participate." Then, selling tickets publicly violates the original regulations, and buying tickets for gambling violates national laws. The government authorities have the right to intervene and prohibit Chinese people from entering for gambling. In this way, unless the Race Club only wants to use the 430 mu of land to exercise the bodies of foreigners behind closed doors and does not want to make money, then unless the mayor has diplomatic skills or we have the money to requisition the land, there is no way to drive them out.</p>
<p>This is a rather serious problem. In the Municipal Council, the reporter often hears councilors talking about the horse racing issue. But after investigation, it seems that most of them do not approve of horse racing, especially not approving of horse racing in the downtown area. Mayor Wu advocates collecting taxes on horse racing and recovering land rights after two years. This does not mean that he approves of horse racing. He just wants to find a way to recover the land. Regardless of whether his method is ideal, his hard work is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Today, Shanghai has produced a public opinion body. We hope that the wise representatives of the people can plan a most suitable method for the people of Shanghai to recover our own land. Finding the most effective and concrete methods is often better than theoretical debates and explanations.</p>

<h3>Strict Precautions Taken at the North Railway Station: Thirty Traitors Escorted to Shanghai and Directly Imprisoned in the Xiaozijian Prison at Tilanqiao; Major Traitors Such as Chen Bijun Not Among Them</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Judicial Administration Department recently instructed that all adjudicated cases of traitors tried in various places near Shanghai must be transferred to Shanghai prisons for execution. The first batch of thirty people from the Third Jiangsu Prison arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the No. 71 local train departing from Changzhou. In advance, it was heard that the group of criminals included major traitors such as Chen Bijun and Chen Zemin, so strict precautions were taken around the platform of the North Railway Station. At 1:05 p.m., the train entered the station. The special train for escorting the traitors was in the last carriage, carriage number TBG 947, responsible for security. The military police loaded live ammunition, and photographers aimed their lenses, making the atmosphere very tense for a while, but there was no sign of Chen Bijun and others. According to Han Yuwen, the chief of the security section of the Third Jiangsu Prison, who was responsible for escorting the criminals to Shanghai, and Li Yurui, the clerk of the Suzhou Higher Court, Chen Bijun has been depressed and bedridden since Chu Minyi was executed. Chen Zemin suffers from a serious illness, and Chen Fumin has a crippled foot. A total of ninety traitors have been sentenced in Suzhou, and the first batch of thirty are being escorted first. There are no major traitors among them. The heaviest sentence is eight years in prison, and the lightest is two years and six months. The other sixty people, including Chen Bijun and others, are awaiting orders and will be prepared to be escorted at any time. These thirty petty traitors were handcuffed in pairs, forming a row, and got off the train in order. Each prisoner carried a small bag or net bag. It was raining heavily at the time. After resting briefly on the platform, they were escorted onto two large buses of the Railway Bureau and driven to the Shanghai Prison in Tilanqiao. After personnel from the prison checked the names one by one and confirmed that there were no errors, they were ordered to be imprisoned in the Xiaozijian Prison. The list of these thirty people is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Zhishan (Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), Chuan Tiancai (Yinxian, Zhejiang), Li Yuxiang (Tengxian, Shandong), Cai Ke (Wujin, Jiangsu), Zhang Xuesheng (Kaifeng, Henan), Ye Jiugao (Songjiang, Jiangsu), Jiang Mingchu (Jiangyin, Jiangsu), Zhang Tianlong (Gaochun, Jiangsu), Zhou Muyuan (Changshu, Jiangsu), Cheng Chongli (Changshu, Jiangsu), Qi Yulin (Jiaxing, Jiangsu), Hu Shaoqing (Hefei, Anhui), Wang Yuliang (Wuxi, Jiangsu), Xu Xihuang (Hengjiang, Jiangsu), Gao Wenqi (Wujin, Jiangsu), Shi Xiaowuzi (Yizheng, Jiangsu), Liu Shulin (Linyu, Hebei), He Meilin (Yangzhong, Jiangsu), Zhang Qin (Dongtai, Jiangsu), Jing Zhong (Wujin, Jiangsu), Zhu Yuandong (Wujin, Jiangsu), Tong Liangjun (Gaochun, Jiangsu), Zhu Liansheng (Taixing, Jiangsu), Wang Chunzhi (Songjiang, Jiangsu), Xu Qingyun (Jiading, Jiangsu), Han Jiahong (Jiangyin, Jiangsu), Jiang Honggen (Dazhi, Hubei), Lu Mengqiao (Jiading, Jiangsu), Zhang Shaonan (Xuancheng, Anhui), Shen Changsheng (Wujiang, Jiangsu).</p>

<h3>British Tram Company Suspends Service Yesterday; Expected to Resume Today After Mediation by Various Agencies; Two Ticket Sellers Who Injured Patrol Officers Each Fined 1,000 Yuan and Released</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) The ticket sellers of the No. 20 trolleybus of the British Shanghai Tramways Company and three patrol officers from the Changning Road Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau had a conflict near Zhongshan Park due to a dispute over taking the bus. The ticket sellers were taken to the branch bureau for investigation. Yesterday, the company's drivers, ticket sellers, etc., went on strike. To understand the truth, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Municipal Police Bureau, who told us the following: At around 8 p.m. last night (the 13th), the No. 350 trolleybus on Route 20, which runs between Jing'an Temple and Zhongshan Park, arrived at the Zhongshan Park terminal. The passengers were extremely crowded and</p>
<p>Struggling to Get on the Bus</p>
<p>At that time, Zhang Desen, Wang Jigang, and Liu Qiyun, three patrol officers from the Changning Road Branch of the Bureau (all in plainclothes), also boarded the bus with the crowd. Zhang and Wang boarded first. When Liu Qiyun was about to step onto the bus, the ticket seller, Dong Lisheng (number 960), suddenly closed the iron gate. Officer Zhang told him that there was still one person and asked him to open the gate, but the other ticket seller on the bus, Wang Guohua (number 1185), slightly opened the gate and then closed it, causing Liu Qiyun's ankle to be crushed. They argued with each other, and the ticket seller actually used the ticket punch to stab Liu Qiyun's left eyebrow, piercing two holes. Officer Zhang also had a piece of flesh pinched from his arm by the ticket punch. At that time, the three officers did not fight back. They then took the two ticket sellers, Dong Lisheng and Wang Guohua, to the Changning Road Branch for investigation. The chairman of the tram employees' union rushed to the branch bureau upon hearing the news and witnessed that the ticket sellers were</p>
<p>Also Injured</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, someone took the opportunity to incite the employees to strike, expanding the disturbance, causing all British trams to stop running today. Trams are public utilities and cannot be interrupted for even one day. This kind of action is disrupting social order. In this turbulent autumn season, there are deep concerns that there are troublemakers inciting from within. The bureau has the responsibility to maintain social security and order. In addition to advising the tram employees to resume work quickly, those behind the scenes will be investigated and punished according to the law.</p>
<p>Furthermore: After the dispute between the police officer and the tram ticket seller at Zhongshan Garden the night before, the company's comprador, Lu Jichun, accompanied by Qiu Changjiang, chairman of the British Tram Industry Union, drove to the Changning Branch,</p>
<p>Requesting Release</p>
<p>Of the arrested ticket sellers. It was not until 3 a.m. that each was fined 1,000 yuan according to the Violation of Police Regulations Act. Lu and Qiu signed a guarantee and left together. Qiu Changjiang also verbally guaranteed that the vehicles on each route would run as usual the next morning. As for the injured officers Liu and Zhang, they went to the Tongren Second Hospital for treatment that night, and the medical expenses were paid by themselves. According to the doctor, Liu Qiyun's forehead had two lacerations, Zhang Desen had a skin injury on his left elbow, and a minor contusion on his left part. Until dusk yesterday, Liu Qiyun's wound suddenly became inflamed, and the symptoms changed. It was decided to send him to the forensic examination office of the local place for diagnosis this morning. The tram workers actually</p>
<p>Went on Strike</p>
<p>Starting yesterday morning. After Mayor Wu opened the inquiry, he ordered the police and social bureaus to work with the inspection office of the Songhu Garrison Command to go to the pass to find a reasonable solution. It is reported that the union has accepted the mediation of various agencies and agreed to resume work and driving this morning. However, it is reported that the workers, because a certain worker was arrested and detained for allegedly inciting the turmoil during the last strike period, has been released, and now they are demanding that the authorities release the worker as an additional condition for resuming work. Therefore, whether work can be resumed is still unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Ge Liangchou, Chairman of the Puppet Nanjing Chamber of Commerce, Sentenced to Three Years in Prison; Zhou Bangjun, Tao Ziwen, and Others Scheduled to Be Sentenced on the 21st; Wang Manyun Case: Witnesses Mr. Wang Xianqing, etc., Subpoenaed for Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>(Report from This Newspaper) Ge Liangchou, chairman of the puppet Nanjing Chamber of Commerce, was sentenced to three years in prison by the High Court yesterday. In addition, Wang Abing, a traitor and secret agent of the enemy, was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. All property, except for the necessary living expenses for the family, will be confiscated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the case of Zhou Bangjun, suspected of being a traitor, concluded with a debate in court yesterday morning, and the sentence is scheduled to be pronounced on the morning of the 21st of this month. According to the defendant's defense: Serving as the deputy director of the puppet Shanghai Baojia Preparatory Committee was intended to lift the policy of terror and blockade imposed by the enemy at that time, so he stepped forward, aiming to save the people. Positions such as member of the Shanghai Branch of the "China-Japan Cultural Association" and member of the "Anti-British and Anti-American Association" were all honorary titles, assigned to him, and he did not bear actual responsibility. As for the accusation in the indictment that the Sino-Western Pharmacy provided the enemy with trucks of medicine, etc., it was the enemy who forcibly robbed them.</p>
<p>The cases of Tao Ziwen, the section chief of the puppet Zhejiang Su County Government, and Zhang Guangdou, the member of the puppet Henan Changsha Municipal Planning Committee and general manager of Yongxing Bank, were also heard yesterday, and both are scheduled to be sentenced on the 21st.</p>
<p>The High Court opened a court in the afternoon to investigate many cases of suspected traitors: In the case of Wang Manyun, the director of the puppet Qingxiang Affairs Bureau, Wang Xianqing, Zhang Shuchun, Li Lin, and Zhao Xing et al. appeared in court to provide favorable evidence for the defendant. In the case of Fan Yongzeng, director of the puppet Shanghai Land Administration Bureau, witnesses were summoned for questioning. In addition, the cases of Li Yanchen, Li Dengshun, Li Dengshuang, Xu Atao, etc., were all postponed for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Langeran et al. Indicted; Insufficient Evidence Against Shen Dexiang</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Li Jianci and Gui Zhen, secret agents of the enemy's gendarmerie in Changshu County, and Xia Hezhang, an intelligence officer, were detained by the Songhu Garrison Command and transferred to the High Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday. In addition, the High Court Prosecutor's Office indicted Langeran, Huang Duigong, and other suspected traitors. Another person, Shen Dexiang, had insufficient evidence and was not prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Scalpers Harm Merchants and Travelers; Ring Leader Arrested in Xin Kaihe</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Huangpu Branch received a secret report the night before last stating that Wu Han, the leader of the scalpers, nicknamed Xiao Heizi, specializes in extorting insurance fees from merchants and travelers on the Bund Pier, taking the opportunity to rob them. The branch sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts. So, yesterday morning, they rushed to No. 1 Taixingli, Xin Kaihe, and arrested the criminal. It is reported that Wu's gang has many members and colludes with warehouse managers, doing everything. The police station is currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Decides to Increase Passenger Ticket Prices by Four and a Half Times; Will Be Implemented from the 21st After Approval by the Ministry</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in view of the large number of irregular freighters in various parts of the country and the very few passenger ships operating on fixed routes, which has led to the stagnation of passenger transport, in order to remedy this situation, recently telegraphed the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau to discuss improvement measures with the Shipping Industry Association and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The board of directors and supervisors of the Shipping Industry Association have decided to restore the "Route Committee" and adjust the sailing schedules of each company on each route to suit supply and demand. It was also decided that the government should grant special rights to regular liners that maintain fixed voyages in order to subsidize them, such as exempting them from dispatching military escorts and allocating fuel at relatively low prices.</p>
<h3>To Maintain Shipping, New Fourth-Class Fares Set</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the passenger ticket prices on each route have been adjusted for half a year since March 1 of this year. The shipping companies, in view of the current price increases of several times, the sharp increase in expenses such as repair materials and wages, and the fact that the original passenger ticket prices cannot be maintained, and because the ticket prices are too low, scalpers often purchase passenger tickets from the shipping companies in sets and resell them to passengers at several times the black market price to make profits, while legitimate passengers are harmed. At the request of various companies and the Shipping Industry Association to adjust ticket prices to maintain operations, the joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the association and the industry meeting discussed it several times, and the passenger ticket prices were decided to be increased by four and a half times the original price. The new fourth-class fares are as follows: Shanghai-Tianjin line 65,000 yuan, Shanghai-Qingdao line 42,000 yuan, Shanghai-Ningbo line 12,000 yuan, Shanghai-Wenzhou line 18,000 yuan, Shanghai-Fujian line 30,000 yuan, Shanghai-Guangdong line 80,000 yuan, Shanghai-Hankou line 52,000 yuan. The association also decided to implement it from the 21st of this month and will submit a request to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Dissipates; Ships Resume Sailing</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Last week, two typhoons suddenly arose in the ocean off Hainan Island, affecting ship navigation. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyue ship was attacked by the wind in Haikou. The details have been reported previously. Yesterday, according to the foreign shipping industry, the two typhoons in Nanyang have now dissipated, and the ships have resumed sailing. However, the schedules have been slightly delayed. Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng ship and Taikoo's Beihai ship, according to the scheduled schedule, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. They had been sheltering from the wind in Shanghai for two days and are expected to arrive here tomorrow (Monday). After the Haiyue ship was attacked by the wind, the hull was slightly damaged and will be sailed to the port for repairs within days. Java Company's Zhazhayunjia ship, on its first return voyage, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Batavia on the 16th. According to the company, it will have to be postponed to the 19th and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 21st and return to Java, which may also be postponed. Shun Heng Foreign Firm's Su Mei Faner ship, managed by Shun Heng Foreign Firm, has also been postponed to arrive in Shanghai on the 18th. The most part of cargo of Haisiting ship, managed by Hualun Foreign Firm, is mainly commodities and is expected to arrive in port next Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
<h3>President Ju of the Judicial Yuan Arrives in Shanghai for Inspection</h3>

<h3>City Land Administration Bureau Section Chief Embezzlement Case: Evidence Obtained Exceeds Ten Million</h3>
<p>The City Land Administration Bureau is handling the case of embezzlement related to the return of land in Pudong by the Bridge Enemy Hengchan Joint-Stock Company. Following a secret investigation by Zhu Ping, the director of the Land Administration Bureau, evidence has been obtained confirming that excessive payments were indeed collected. The amount of embezzlement discovered, for which evidence has been secured, totals over 13 million yuan. All files related to the entire case have been transferred to the Land Increase Department for legal investigation. Zhang Jiliang, the section chief of the bureau suspected of involvement, has been administratively dismissed from his position by Director Zhu, after seeking instructions from Mayor Wu, and ordered to be released on bail pending further investigation. Yesterday, Director Zhu told the Hua Dong News Agency reporter that the authority to return the land was decided on the principle of return before he took office, during the tenure of the previous director, Chen Shiquan. The method of payment was also determined in a plan as early as May 18th. After he took office, the relevant section began the return process. Recently, after learning of reports of excessive collections, he immediately launched a strict investigation. Everything is now awaiting judicial handling, and the truth will soon come to light.</p>
<h3>Grand Parade of Pickpockets: Guilty, Afraid to Raise Their Heads; Orderly Under Armed Surveillance; The District Attorney's Office Suddenly Faces Overcrowding</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The "Grand Parade of Pickpockets" was solemnly held yesterday morning under the strict guard of fully armed personnel. Many of the "Fleas on a Drum" who participated in the parade kept their heads down under the scrutiny of the public, showing a "guilty, afraid to raise their heads" spectacle. The detectives supervising the parade saw that their hard work had not been in vain. After this "escort," the days of hard work had finally come to an end, and they naturally couldn't help but feel a little smug. However, the gentlemen at the District Attorney's Office, who suddenly found themselves with booming business, were overwhelmed and secretly complaining incessantly!</p>
<p>The "escort" was held in two parts. The first was at 10 a.m., involving 321 pickpockets. It was led by jeeps and motorcycles, followed closely by a squadron of security police, then the car patrol, and finally the "Pickpocket Brigade." They were arranged in rows of three, with excellent order and remarkably synchronized steps. There were no stragglers among the three in each row—why? Because they were connected by handcuffs!</p>
<p>The spectators on both sides of the road were a sea of people. Some said, "It's really good to watch, but it's just missing a military band." These unfortunate people were lucky because it started raining just as they arrived at the District Attorney's Office, which was a relief.</p>
<p>The second group started at 11 a.m. It was less sensational than the first, as only 75 pickpockets participated. They were unlucky; they had only reached the middle of Linsen Road when thunder and lightning began, and a torrential downpour turned the "Fleas on a Drum" into "drenched chickens."</p>
<p>Various Types: A Magnificent Spectacle</p>
<p>This pickpocket brigade consisted of 396 people, divided into three squadrons. There was a wide variety of them, making it a magnificent sight. In terms of clothing, some were impeccably dressed, looking like upper-class people, while most were shabbily dressed and looked haggard. Among these 396 people, there were over twenty children and over twenty women!</p>
<p>The District Attorney's Office really couldn't accommodate so many suddenly arriving "guests." With no other choice, they had to open the iron gates wide to welcome these 396 heroes inside, inviting them to rest in the hall. However, roll call and identification took a long time, until dusk. Seeing that the detention center was already overcrowded, another escort was organized, and a large portion was sent to Tilanqiao—because the "housing shortage" in Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison is not currently very serious.</p>
<p>The task of clearing up pickpockets in Shanghai is the responsibility of the Criminal Police Division of the Police Bureau, headed by the Section Chief of the Second Section, Li Junhou. To handle this transfer, he mobilized 250 detectives. They started working from 8 a.m. yesterday, but the District Attorney's Office was inevitably overwhelmed because it had fewer staff—after the District Attorney's Office, there is the District Court; will there be another exciting performance later?</p>
<p>Many Categories: Caution First</p>
<p>The Police Bureau has investigated the twenty-odd categories and methods of pickpocketing very clearly. Because this newspaper has already recorded them many times, except for a few of the more interesting ones briefly explained below, the others will not be described in detail. As for prevention methods, the Police Bureau wrote the four words "Caution First." In other words, it's still: "Take care of your clothes, hats, and belongings." Although "there is no thousand-year defense against thieves," it is always better to be more careful.</p>
<p>Reaching for the Sky: Using a bamboo pole with a small iron hook tied to it, stealing clothes by reaching into balconies, platforms, or windows when people are unprepared.</p>
<p>Both Sides Shining: Also known as Collapsing Pancake, this involves breaking glass windows after first sticking handkerchiefs or paper on the shop's glass display windows to prevent noise, in order to carry out theft.</p>
<p>Muffled Kiln: Sneaking into shops and residences in the evening, hiding first, and then stealing after people are asleep.</p>
<p>Ground Crawl: Gathering three or five or more people outside shops, wharves, stations, etc., and using fake boxes or packages to cover the objects of others, stealing them away when people are unprepared.</p>
<p>Knocking on the Kerosene Tank: Three or five people use rickshaws to solicit business. When passengers sit on the cushions, they use their buttocks to contact the passengers' pockets, taking the opportunity to pickpocket. After succeeding, they make excuses such as a flat tire or other methods to make the passenger change vehicles.</p>
<p>Running Old Plays: Divided into several types such as Flat Ground, Rolling Plate, Vegetable Household, and Bottom. This involves pickpocketing on the road, trams, buses, or vegetable markets. The Bottom type involves pickpocketing on ships. The methods involve using blades to cut bags, pliers to pinch, or scissors to cut open.</p>
<p>Leading the Yellow Ox: An accomplice takes a rickshaw to a destination. Under the pretext of paying the fare, they make the rickshaw pull away with them, while another accomplice steals the rickshaw.</p>

<p>[News from Kangding, Our Newspaper] The Education Department of Xikang Province is promoting border education and has now determined three principles to proceed step by step, as follows: (1) Adopting the "Three-izations" education policy, namely Moralization, Modernization, and Assimilation, as the highest principle for promoting border education in Xikang Province. (2) According to the instructions of the Ministry of Education, "Border education emphasizes quality over quantity." Schools in areas that are too remote and sparsely populated will be abolished and merged to strengthen existing schools. (3) Focusing on improving the lives of border residents. Border areas have underdeveloped cultures and primitive production technologies. The construction of border areas should involve communicating the cultures of various ethnic groups and improving the lives of border residents. Therefore, school facilities should focus on improving cultural standards and imparting production technology. The teaching materials and methods used should all be based on this standard. However, border areas lack grassroots administrative cadres, making it difficult to promote administrative work below the county level. Training in the basics of local autonomy is emphasized, and the implementation method is planned to be completed in four years.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Order Banning Private Printing of State-Approved Textbooks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Ministry of Education, noting that the trend of pirating state-approved textbooks for primary and secondary schools has been rampant recently, with numerous errors in content and particularly poor printing quality, has specifically telegraphed to the provincial and municipal governments to explain that state-approved textbooks for primary and secondary schools are entrusted by the ministry to seven joint supply offices for printing, under contract. The offices are responsible for unified supply. Except for regions where the offices cannot guarantee supply, provincial and municipal government agencies, schools, and publishing houses may not reprint them without the approval of the Ministry of Education, to avoid chaotic versions and poor paper quality, and to affect the unified supply plan. If private printing is found, it should be investigated and banned, and the printed textbooks will be confiscated.</p>

<h3>Jinan University Dismisses Professors: Holds Reception for Reporters Yesterday, Chaired by Professor Yu Jianhua</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since Li Shouyong took over as president of National Jinan University, only about forty of the more than one hundred and fifty reinstated professors have been rehired, causing widespread indignation. Yesterday (the 14th) at 3:00 p.m., the reinstated but not rehired professors of the university held a special meeting at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge in this city to express their views to the press. Over thirty reporters from newspapers and news agencies attended. Professor Yu Jianhua chaired the meeting and first reported on the university's internal situation. During the period of turmoil, the dismissed professors had all moved west with the school, sticking to their posts despite the hardships. However, upon returning, they were treated with such discrimination, which was unexpected. Subsequently, Professor Zou Youhua reported on the negotiations with President Li, saying that although the dismissed professors sent representatives to negotiate with him repeatedly, President Li always prevaricated and did not reach any results, and pushed all the responsibility to the deceased President He Bingsong, claiming that President He had individual criticisms of the original professors. However, this argument is clearly not true. According to Miss He, the daughter of President He, President He first came to Shanghai this spring to prepare for the school's restoration. In April, he sent a letter to the Jianyang campus, saying that the school's restoration was already in order and inviting all professors to come to Shanghai to cooperate. She can testify against President Li's slander. Later, Professor Zhang Li stated that many of the dismissed professors had worked for ten or twenty years. They had long regarded teaching as a lifelong career, so they hoped that the press would give them sincere sympathy and strong support.</p>

<h3>Civil Affairs Department Explains Doubts Regarding Household Registration Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Department recently received an urgent request from the Fourth District Office regarding three points of doubt about the Household Registration Law, and has issued the following clarifications after review: (1) Article 11, paragraph 2 of the Implementing Rules of the Household Registration Law stipulates that "If there are household affiliates with different natures within a household, separate households should be established according to their natures." Its interpretation can refer to Article 8, paragraph 2 of the Shanghai Municipal Household Registration Handling Regulations, "If a household is under the same manager in the same location and serves as a joint enterprise and joint life, it shall be regarded as a joint enterprise household." That is, those not in the same location or not under the same manager are regarded as affiliated in nature and should establish separate households according to their natures. (2) The request to inspect the household registration book or deliver a transcript for a fee is limited to interested parties. If a lawyer requests the household registration director to inspect the household registration book or deliver a transcript on behalf of a party, a letter of authorization from the party must be presented, and the inspection fee or copy fee should still be paid. (3) The amount of the inspection fee and copy fee is too small, and a request to increase it is currently being sent to the central government. After a reply is received, another order will be issued for compliance.</p>
<h3>Total Registration of Pregnant Women Held in the 23rd District</h3>
<p>The 23rd District Office recently approved a letter from the Wusong Health Office stating that midwifery work is an important part of promoting maternal and infant health. However, most rural women rely on midwives who are unfamiliar with disinfection procedures, resulting in many maternal deaths each year. A general registration of pregnant women is planned to be conducted to send staff to visit and examine them and to facilitate delivery. The district has now notified all Bao to actively investigate and register. In addition, the 9th Bao of the district (Wusong) plans to add a Jia as the 11th Jia due to the recent surge in residents, and has nominated Bai Rufu as the Jia leader, which has been submitted to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<h3>Reassignment of the 29th District Chief, Dismissal of the Chief Executive Zhou Zhongke</h3>
<p>Liu Ding, the Chief of the 29th District of Shanghai, has another concurrent position and does not regularly reside in the district office, neglecting his duties. Yesterday, the municipal government dismissed him. The vacant position has been temporarily filled by Zhu Yougu, the Deputy District Chief. In addition, Zhou Zhongke, the Chief Executive of the District Office, falsely reported a leave of absence and stayed in Shanghai. Yesterday, the municipal government dismissed him. The vacancy will be filled by Shi Zhenting, a discharged youth soldier.</p>
<h3>The Fourth District Examines Bao Secretaries</h3>
<p>In order to understand the work of each Bao and strengthen the Baojia organization, the Fourth District Office prepared a weekly work report last month, which was distributed to the Bao secretaries to fill out, and the weekly work report was listed as one of the attendance evaluations. Anyone who is absent from a Bao secretary meeting will receive a reprimand for the first absence and a demerit for the second absence.</p>
<h3>The 26th District Investigates Farmers, Plans to Request the Issuance of Insecticides</h3>
<p>The 26th District of Shanghai (Longhua) is located in the suburbs, and most of the people are engaged in agriculture. However, when crops are affected by pests and diseases, it is often difficult to eliminate them, which often leads to insect plagues and heavy losses. Now, the District Chief Chen Kai has ordered each Bao to investigate and fill out information about farmers in order to transfer it to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to allocate UNRRA-JDC disease and pest control drugs for prevention and treatment.</p>
<h3>Q &amp; A on Household Registration Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>(5) Statistics Category</p>
<p>Q: If a woman has fled and her whereabouts are unknown, which table should she be included in for statistics?</p>
<p>A: When counting migratory populations, she should be included in the outgoing population, but her household registration should be retained.</p>
<p>Q: Can the migration household registration statistics be combined with the establishment and cancellation of registration?</p>
<p>A: The natures are different and cannot be combined.</p>
<p>Q: Can the item "Transfer Registration" in the Household Registration Change Statistics in the Household Registration Statistical Report Form (5) be increased to two items: "Transfer In" and "Transfer Out"?</p>
<p>A: Transfer In and Transfer Out of Transfer Registration are different from Establishment of Registration and Cancellation of Registration. The former is carried out simultaneously and is a procedure to be handled in the transfer registration, while the latter cannot be carried out simultaneously and the procedures are also different. The Household Registration Law has other regulations. After handling the Transfer Registration, separate applications for Registration Establishment and Registration Cancellation are still required. The reason why Transfer Registration is listed in one column in the Household Registration Statistical Report Form (5) is to record the total number of Transfer In and Transfer Out, so there is no need to divide it into two columns.</p>

<h3>Too Many Difficulties in the Knitting Industry: Two-Thirds are Shut Down; Industry Seeks a Way Out as Peak Season Nears.</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] recently spoke with people in the knitting industry about the current situation of the industry, and they told me that the industry is currently in a difficult environment. Their specific difficulties are: (1) The Spinning and Weaving Company allocates yarn and thread equally to large and small factories, resulting in large factories having to rely on the black market when raw materials are insufficient, which increases production costs. (2) After the exchange rate adjustment, factories that started production felt even more difficulties. Because the yarn and thread from the black market, and other raw materials such as caustic soda, pigments, etc., all rose in price following the exchange rate adjustment. However, most of the products of the knitting industry maintained their original prices. Even if there were adjustments, they did not exceed 10% at most. The price increase of products and raw materials was not balanced. The general difficulties include: (1) High-interest loans pose the greatest threat to the industry. Generally speaking, a profit of about 1.5% is considered good for the industry. However, the current hidden interest rate is about the same as this profit. Therefore, if short-term loans are used for operation, the profit earned is just enough to cover the interest expenses, and all other expenses still need to be subsidized. (2) Labor disputes are not as serious in the industry as in other industries, but it is still hoped that the labor unions will understand the difficulties of the times and give full play to the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation.</p>
<p>It is reported that there are currently 618 members in the industry association. Among them, only 108 use electric motors, and the rest are hand-operated loom factories. Therefore, large factories account for about one-fourth of the total. Due to the impact of the above-mentioned difficulties, more than 400 factories have shut down. Most of the remaining 200 or so are also in a semi-operational state. Only about 50 factories are really able to operate every day. The operating rate of each factory is only about 20% of what it was before the war. An operating rate of 20% or more is already considered rare. In terms of sock production, the industry could produce about 100,000 dozen socks per day before the war, but now it is less than 20,000 dozen. However, because the production is limited, sales are still good. It is said that the current peak season for knitted products has arrived, and according to the usual practice, supply should be in short supply. However, due to the obstruction of transportation in various places, sales in other regions are greatly affected. In Southeast Asia, although the export price has slightly improved after this exchange rate adjustment, the quantity is very small and is limited to the small Luzon area. In other areas, it is temporarily impossible to develop because the Sino-British Commercial Treaty has not yet been finalized.</p>
<p>The industry is currently planning to find solutions to the current difficulties. The industry association will notify all its members: (1) To assist the government in its decision to stabilize prices and firmly maintain the original prices before the exchange rate adjustment. (2) It is reported that some members of the industry are transferring the cotton yarn warehouse receipts allocated by the Spinning and Weaving Company. This should be strictly investigated and prohibited. In terms of improving the allocation of yarn, the industry association will prepare a recent production status report on the current situation of the industry, clarifying the number of machines in each factory and the actual situation of yarn consumption, so as to provide a reference for the Spinning and Weaving Company to allocate goods. At the same time, it is hoped that the Four Allied Relief Agencies can provide the industry with reasonable loans. For example, when providing loans, do not insist on using raw materials as collateral, but use various real estate, factory buildings, machines, etc. as alternatives to ease the difficulties of merchants. It is also hoped that when the agency lends funds, it can negotiate directly with the various manufacturers to avoid repeated contacts and create abuses.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices are Narrowly Fluctuating, Few US Dollar Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold initially showed fatigue but then stabilized, possibly due to eager customer sales. It opened at 2.145 million, and after opening, supply and demand were balanced, and trading was narrow. It rose slightly from 2.135 million to 2.155 million. The central bank had some controls, and rallies were curbed. After 10:00 AM, the central bank allocated 120 taels at a price of 2.1425 million. After that, trading was small again, falling to 2.135 million before entering the trading day. In the end, due to the eagerness of customer sales from Fujian and Shantou, buying interest did not wane. At noon, trading rose to around 2.16 million. There was not much trading in the afternoon due to Saturday. As a result, it closed 14,000 higher than the previous close. Decorative gold was quoted at 29,000. Both silver bullion and silver dollars showed little change. The underground discount rate ranged from 14% to 17%.</p>
<p>There were no special changes in foreign currencies. The US dollar opened at 3,390 yuan in the morning and remained around 3,380 yuan throughout the middle of the day. There were few transactions. At noon, it rose slightly to around the morning opening price due to the rise in the overnight price. There was still little change in the afternoon. As a result, it closed 10 yuan higher than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were slightly stable, closing 5 yuan higher than the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 695 yuan to 705 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 840 yuan to 850 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 11,200 yuan to 11,400 yuan. The US exchange rate remained at the official rate.</p>
<h3>Increased Trading in Government Bonds</h3>
<p>Government bonds traded slightly better yesterday, with increased trading. As a result, people inevitably became more bullish. Unified Class C opened at 2,500 yuan, with a high price of 2,570 yuan. There were also more bulls selling, and it retreated to 2,300 yuan at closing. As a result, it closed 80 yuan higher than the previous close. Miscellaneous brands were favored by more people and all saw prosperity. Class A and B bonds were up 150 yuan, Class D bonds were up 100 yuan, and Class E bonds were only up 70 yuan. Transactions reached 6 million yuan in par value. People had mixed views on the Four Allied Relief Agencies' proposal to double the repayment of deposits.</p>
<h3>Autumn Sales Begin, Yarn Market Firm</h3>
<p>The yarn market remained firm yesterday. Autumn sales are gradually picking up, and all the gangs have buying interest, with combed yarn being the most popular. However, the supply of spot goods is also low, so the price only increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. If there were no government order prohibiting shipments to South China, the yarn price would definitely be even more prosperous. The prices of 16-count and 42-count double-stranded yarn were similar to the previous day, with both gains and losses. People's hearts are stable, and the future is quite optimistic.</p>
<h3>Rayon Actual Sales Are Not Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rayon was slightly weak in the morning. 120-count Tianqiao was priced at 2.7 million to 2.72 million yuan. In the afternoon, because actual sales were not weak and because transactions had to be settled the day after tomorrow, the price was raised by another 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brand 120-count Jin San Ma bright rayon was 2.65 million yuan in the morning and about 2.7 million yuan in the afternoon. Semi-dull rayon was 2.3 million yuan in the morning and 2.35 million yuan in the afternoon. There were no transactions in 75 semi-dull rayon. Factory silk transactions were rare, and prices fluctuated around the original price. Silk fabrics were quite stable, and market prices did not change.</p>
<h3>Eager Customer Sales of Wool Fabrics</h3>
<p>The wool fabric market continued to be active. The Sichuan, Hunan, Beijing, and Hangzhou gangs were all strongly adding goods. Melton overcoats, grass green and navy blue gabardine, suit flannels, and Xuanwei were all in high demand. Because the Autumn Festival has passed, actual sales of Chinese and Western wool fabrics are extremely active. The business of various military uniform stores is increasing steadily. Due to transportation issues, if purchases and shipments are not made now, the goods will be late for the sales season. Therefore, winter overcoat fabrics are also being purchased one after another, making transactions even more lively.</p>
<h3>Transaction Tax Temporarily Not Collected, Stock Exchange Set to Open Tomorrow, Commission: 3/1000 for Stocks, 2/1000 for Bonds</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yesterday, the stock exchange held its last rehearsal, and the results were considered satisfactory. At the same time, the stock exchange has accepted the suggestions of various brokers to enlarge the blackboards on the east and west corridors and to list the buying and selling prices separately. There are 18 trading counters in the market, of which 6 were arranged in a row, and have been removed. The remaining 12 are arranged in a large circle. The 20 listed stocks are assigned to the 6 trading counters in the inner circle. A new blackboard has been added to each trading right to write the stock buying and selling prices. When brokers engage in transactions in the 6 trading counters, they can clearly see the stock market prices on the blackboards from all sides, without the difficulties of the rehearsal. The stock exchange authorities also said that they would try their best to adopt and implement suggestions from all parties if they have real improvement value.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Stock Exchange held its first second joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Securities Building yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, presided over by Mr. Du Yong. More than 20 people including Chen Guangfu, Li Fuson, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiching, and Xu Weiming attended. The chairman and others reported separately, and then discussed and passed the exchange's organizational outline and decided that September 16 would be the official opening date, first conducting one morning session. The remaining decisions were: (1) Each broker is required to have 5 business clerks. (2) The commission issue will be temporarily assumed by the exchange before the establishment of the brokers' association, including the handling fee. The commission for stock company prices is 3/1000 (ie 30/10,000), and the commission for government bonds is 2/1000. The above is what is charged to customers. (3) The substitutes for the guarantee deposit will be announced by the bank designated by the central bank and sent to various brokers. Temporarily use a written guarantee to exchange securities and real estate within one month. (4) The transaction tax will not be collected temporarily and will be implemented after being passed and announced by the authorities. (5) Report the opening date to the two ministries of finance and economy and send letters to the exchange supervisors. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. Another report said that the Ministry of Finance had previously stipulated that the transaction tax would be 10/10,000, but it has now been revised by the Legislative Yuan to 5/10,000, to be borne by the seller.</p>
<h3>Autumn Cocoon Loans to Begin Tomorrow, Cocoons Can Be Collected on the 20th</h3>
<p>After several consultations with relevant parties, this year's autumn cocoon loans will be officially launched tomorrow (the 16th) morning. The amount of this loan will be borne solely by the China Farmers Bank. The organization of its institutions is very different from the "spring cocoon loans." Its technical personnel and administrative aspects are uniformly managed by the China Silk Corporation. The loan will begin on the 16th. On the 18th, the Shanghai remittance will be paid to cocoon merchants in various places. On the 20th, various places can officially begin to purchase cocoons. The China Silk Corporation has accepted applications from cocoon merchants since yesterday. As of the afternoon, 17 companies had applied, and the total number of companies is about 50 or more. In addition, the China Silk Corporation will send staff to each cocoon firm that has obtained a loan. The tasks of these resident staff members are (1) to be responsible for filling in the daily amount and quality of cocoons purchased, and (2) to supervise the incoming and outgoing accounting of each firm to prevent fraud.</p>
<h3>Subsidy Fees to be Issued Within Days</h3>
<p>In order to help silk farmers and manufacturers, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in conjunction with the China Silk Corporation and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, decided to reduce the sale of autumn seeds by half this year, with the half price being subsidized by the government. It is learned that various silkworm seeds in this province have already been closed, and the government subsidy is stipulated to be advanced by the Central Trust Bureau, totaling 110,000,000 yuan in Jiangsu Province. The various branches of the China Farmers Bank are responsible for handling the matter, and the funds will be issued within days. Seed farms that have not received loans should submit their subsidy requests according to the actual number of seeds sold.</p>
<h3>Hankou Tung Oil Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Changxing ship of the Sanbei Company arrived at the port in the evening of the day before yesterday and berthed at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong, with more than 1,350 pieces of tung oil and more than 300 pieces of flue-cured tobacco from Hankou.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Show Strength in Unpopular Sectors, Foreign Stocks Have Excellent Potential</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks also turned prosperous, with unpopular stocks showing even more strength. Most are preparing to launch at high prices when the stock exchange officially reopens in the coming days. Searches are eager. All stocks saw gains along the way, but higher prices struggled. The closing results were higher than the previous close. Yongsha and Meiya each rose slightly, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose by about 5%. The mid-sized stocks in the more unpopular sectors were stable, and the small stocks also rose by about half a percent. The veteran stocks remained at their original prices. Small stocks that have been approved for listing attract general retail investors to follow due to their low prices, showing more strength.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks turned from stable to firm yesterday. Buying interest was even higher at the close, with excellent potential. Jardine Silk rose from 9,300 yuan to 9,700 yuan, and British American Tobacco rose from 11,300 yuan to 11,800 yuan. The closing results were Jardine Silk, Papermaking, and Shipping up half a percent, and BAT up 10%. Hongkong Land and Jardine Brewery rose slightly, while Hongkong Electric and Hongkong Steel were flat.</p>
<h3>2,000 Dan of Raw Silk Purchased, Payment Available Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Central Trust Bureau's purchase of raw silk made from this year's spring cocoons began on the 10th. As of the weekend, more than 2,100 dan had been submitted to the Central Trust Bureau. Most of the quality was CD grade, with a small number below D grade. F grade has not yet been found. The results are quite satisfactory. The prices to be paid are 3.8 million yuan per dan for D grade and above, and 3.3 million yuan per dan for E grade. In the future, after the value is determined, it will be calculated according to the actual weight, with overpayments returned and underpayments made up. The silk was purchased by the Central Trust Bureau, and checks have been issued to the manufacturers in full today. The Central Bank will deduct the spring cocoon loans, labor loans, and 10% of the autumn cocoon loans when the checks are presented for payment, and then return the balance to the manufacturers. However, because the China Silk Corporation still needs to review the release of autumn cocoon loans before submitting the forms to the bank, the procedures for withdrawing funds from the Central Bank will be delayed until next Monday (the 16th).

<h3>2,000 Dan of Spring Silkworm Dried Cocoons, China Farmers Bank Purchases at Full Price</h3>
<p>The China Farmers Bank conducted spring silkworm dried cocoon loans in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in May this year, with a limit of three months, which has now expired, and the silkworm farmers have not yet sold them. The bank has now decided to purchase them at full price. The target of this loan is the silkworm farmers' cooperatives. After the silkworm farmers dry the fresh cocoons, they mortgage them to the Farmers Bank at 70% of the price, totaling more than 2,000 dan. The Farmers Bank is purchasing all of them this time and has raised the cocoon price to 655,000 yuan per dan. After signing a contract with the representatives of the various cooperatives on the 13th, it immediately purchased more than 1,700 dan and will complete the purchase within days. It is reported that after the Farmers Bank purchases them, it will entrust the Chongyu Silk Factory to reel the silk for overseas sales, which is expected to produce 500 dan of silk.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Discussion on the Valuation of Assets Prepared by Banks and Firms</h3>
<p>Before accepting the asset declaration of each member bank and firm, the Silver Money Industry Joint Preparatory Committee should first stipulate the various prices of (1) bonds and securities, (2) investment certificates, (3) real estate, and (4) cargo warehouse receipts for unified regulations. On the afternoon of the 13th, the committee convened experts from various industries in the city at the Bankers Association, with Mr. Li Fuson presiding, for a preliminary discussion. Those present included Li Shuxiong, He Sandao (real estate industry), Yu Mingshi (stock industry), etc. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Wang Bietang, representatives from the Central Bank, Wang Liangqin, and Shen Rixin and Wang Yangsu from the Qianye industry were also invited to participate. On the spot, the experts exchanged opinions on the above-mentioned regulations on the property to be paid, based on the current market price. Mr. Li Fuson also proposed on the spot to invite the experts to set up small subcommittees, and integrate them into a valuation committee, and under the guidance of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, re-evaluate the prices of the properties to be paid. According to the information, the committee previously sent letters to various members to limit the time to determine the amount of assets to be prepared. As of yesterday, more than 100 members have responded with their asset declaration.</p>
<h3>Indica Rice Market Price Continues to Fall, Trade in Miscellaneous Grains Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market's digestion remained sluggish, with a total of more than 9,000 Shi of goods registered. There were slight differences between the north and south markets. In the north market, the higher-quality freshly harvested indica and japonica rice from the port were firm, but the customer indica rice from Zhongguan was still weak and little traded. The newly produced Yinyuan continued to fall by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. In the south market, the newly produced Baiyuan and Yinyuan also fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Various kinds of indica rice were down by more than 1,000 yuan. The freshly harvested japonica was similar, but the Duxian and Zhanxian were uniformly depressed in both the north and south markets. Flour shops' demand turned strong, rising slightly by 100 yuan, forming a fluctuating situation. Rice bran was flat, Xiaochou and Minhua were sluggish, the Ningbo gang was also relaxed, the north was still, and the market was mediocre. There was a slight arrival of soybeans from the northeast, and they remained highly fixed and slowly sold. Corn from Qingdao was suspended, and the price fell by another 500 to 600 yuan. Sesame from Southeast Asia was suspended, and there were few transactions on the street, with prices falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Broad beans from Guangzhou were not accepted and were shortened by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, with few transactions. Broad beans were still trending weakly, softening by 300 to 500 yuan. Red sorghum was similar. The supply of the oil market was ample, falling by a small 1,000 yuan. Bean cake was sluggish, falling by 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ample Inventory, Paper Prices Unlikely to Rise</h3>
<p>According to paper industry insiders, the current inventory of various types of paper in this city is quite substantial. There is also a large influx of Soviet newspapers, which has led to sluggish sales of domestically produced paper and a slump in paper prices. It is unlikely that there will be any improvement in the short term. For example, the Jiangnan and Tianzhang paper mills, which are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, have recently reduced the production of newsprint and are now producing high-quality writing paper and banknote paper due to poor sales. However, the United States has recently experienced a paper shortage, and paper merchants in this city have stopped ordering paper from the United States. At the same time, prices in the United States have also risen, making it more cost-effective to purchase spot goods from the timber market. According to industry insiders, Canada, Sweden, and Finland are the only major paper-producing regions in the world that can export large quantities of paper in addition to meeting their own needs. All other countries must rely on foreign supplies. Although there is currently a large stock of paper in this city, it is said that the various factories under the Ministry of Economic Affairs have planned to significantly increase the production of newsprint next year.</p>
<h3>Chengda Opens Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chengda Bank has a long history and strong reputation in the rear area. The General Manager, Zhang Yuliang, has now established a Shanghai branch on Sichuan Middle Road, which is scheduled to open on the 16th. According to the industry news obtained by this newspaper, the bank has been approved to join the Shanghai Banking Association as a member and has been granted direct exchange number 182 by the Central Bank Clearing House. Chengda is the first bank in Shanghai to join the Banking Association and obtain a direct exchange number.</p>
<h3>Monthly Oil Demand: 36,000 Dans; Supply Reaches 40,000 Dans</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Review Committee and the revision of the supply and sale methods, the edible oil market in this city has improved. For the past week, the price of rapeseed oil has been capped at 86,000 yuan, and the price of soybean oil has been capped at 93,000 yuan, and has remained unchanged. The price of vegetable oil supplied and sold by the China Vegetable Oil Factory was already 1,000 yuan lower than the capped price on the 13th, at 85,000 yuan per unit, including delivery. Only raw oil has a slight black market, with the capped price being 97,000 yuan and the black market price being 101,000 yuan. This phenomenon should be easy to eliminate. The China Edible Oil Company has more than 10,000 dans of oil in stock, which will be distributed by the China Vegetable Oil Factory within the next week, at 100 barrels per day. If the China Vegetable Oil Factory resumes its plan to supply and sell 200 barrels per month, the market price will certainly not increase again. The monthly demand in this city is no more than 36,000 dans. The Review Committee has decided that the China Vegetable Oil Factory will supply 10,000 dans per month, the China Edible Oil Company will supply 10,000 dans, and private factories will supply 20,000 dans, for a total of 40,000 dans, which is more than enough to supply the market. The market can be stabilized, and there should be no problems.</p>
<h3>Peach Kernel Powder and Dried Noodles Fall Back</h3>
<p>Peach kernels, which had risen to more than 400,000 yuan due to shortages, have fallen sharply recently due to continuous arrivals from Hankou. The lowest price quoted was 260,000 yuan. Dried vermicelli noodles have also fallen back by about 30 percent, to only 320,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Arrival of Goods Causes a Plunge in Job's Tears</h3>
<p>The inventory of Job's tears was depleted, and the market price had reached a peak. Now, large quantities have been transported from Yuzhou at very low cost. As a result, market sentiment is weak, and prices have plummeted. Even with a price reduction of 240,000 yuan, there are few inquiries.</p>
<h3>Chen Needle Eyebrow Green Tea: Sales in Africa</h3>
<p>Needle Eyebrow green tea, which is sold to Africa, has recently received repeated telegrams requesting the packing of old stock. As a result, the market for this type of tea has been very active in recent days. Other types of tea are also selling well for export, especially Fujian small bud tea. As for the B.O.P. mark Taiwan fine black tea, which is being watched by Indian merchants, the supply is still lacking. Although local tea factories are trying to imitate it, the quality of the product is poor, and buyers are not satisfied, so the price is low, only between 94,000 and 95,000 yuan per dan. However, according to the suppliers, they are reluctant to sell at that price due to high costs, so the situation remains stagnant. Domestic sales of red and green tea, on the other hand, remain brisk.</p>
<h3>Twelfth Bayer Allocation: From the 19th to the 23rd</h3>
<p>The Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory Liquidation Office has decided to hold the twelfth allocation of German drugs, starting on the 19th and ending on the 23rd. Late submissions will be considered as a waiver. This allocation involves 238 companies and a total of about 390 groups, each with more than 40 types of drugs, with a total value of 160 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Shortage: Rumors of Arrivals from Taiwan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, caustic soda was uniquely strong because there were few foreign arrivals and local inventories were dwindling. In addition, the Tianjin-Sichuan merchants were purchasing it. It was found that dyeing, weaving, and mercerizing factories in this city were working day and night, and actual sales were increasing. The price rose by 100,000 yuan per 300 kilograms. According to industry insiders, if there are no more arrivals of this product in the future, the outlook may remain positive. There were arrivals of sulfuric acid, and the price plummeted.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Alkali Manufacturing Company has recently been working hard to promote production in all departments. It is said that it is now able to produce solid caustic soda in large quantities and is preparing to transport it to Shanghai for sale.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate of Northeastern Currency: Black Market Lower Than Official Rate; Executive Yuan Economic Commission Discussing Measures</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang by This Newspaper on the 14th] The official exchange rate between legal tender and Northeastern currency remains at thirteen to one. The black market rate has recently fluctuated between 10.05 yuan and 9.5 yuan for one yuan of Northeastern currency. This black market is controlled by dozens of money changers at Shanhai Pass. The Finance Group of the Executive Yuan Economic Commission is currently discussing plans to regulate it. Some people argue that the rate of thirteen to one should be maintained. Their reason is that if the official exchange rate changes to twelve or ten to one, the black market will change to nine or eight to one, which is beyond prediction, and the government will become passive. It would be best for the Bank of China to set up an office in Yu and exchange large amounts of currency to take the initiative. Others argue that it should be set according to the actual situation, because this issue is of great concern to civil servants remitting family expenses and prices both inside and outside the customs.</p>
<h3>China's Import and Export Situation: American Businessmen Express Surprise; Industrial Raw Material Prices Two to Three Times Higher Than in the United States; Raw Materials Exported, Finished Products Ordered from Abroad</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 13th] According to authoritative American manufacturers, although the commercial situation in China has not yet stabilized, the import of industrial chemical raw materials to China is expected to continue to increase. Orders from China are constantly arriving. Due to the excess arrivals, high prices have started to react. For example, a 300-kilogram drum of caustic soda sells for the equivalent of 780 US dollars. However, the market price in Shanghai is generally still two or three times higher than in the United States. However, some Chinese merchants have been forced to sell their inventories at prices below cost, or even without profit. Currently, 2,000 tons of sodium bicarbonate have been shipped or are on their way to Shanghai. The price of a 100-pound bag has fallen from 60 US dollars to 14 US dollars, but demand remains extremely active. Although China has its own sulfuric acid plants, it has recently received an order for 40 tons of sulfuric acid. Other inquiries include tannic acid, whose raw material, gallnut, used to occupy an important position in China's exports.</p>

<h3>The Examination System and Nation-Building</h3>
<p>— Cheng Tixuan</p>
<p>It has been nearly eighteen years since the establishment of the Examination Yuan. During these eighteen years, the overall situation has experienced countless storms, and the country has suffered unprecedented disasters. The land is scarred, and everything is difficult. However, in the past, even in the midst of war, the government authorities were able to hold grand talent selection ceremonies to select capable individuals for the country. Now that we have entered a period of peace and national construction, and all kinds of construction require talent, it is even more necessary to strengthen the examination system. The reasons for this, such as (1) meeting the needs of nation-building work, (2) achieving the goal of an all-encompassing government, and (3) avoiding the unrest caused by partisan politics, are already self-evident. Now, please allow me to briefly express my hopes for the examination authorities:</p>
<p>(1) Quantitative Coordination: People, time, place, things, and objects must be coordinated to achieve success. This is the working method that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has instructed us to follow. If we expand its scope, then the location of all large and small institutions in the country, the people they need, the tasks they perform, and the materials they should have, should all have accurate statistics. Because only with accurate statistics can we talk about appropriate coordination; and the central examination agency should be responsible for coordinating all personnel throughout the country. Therefore, I think the examination authorities should first conduct a general personnel survey of all institutions in the country (including central and local ones). After the survey is completed, they should pay attention to its dynamic registration at any time. Even without specific job classifications to rely on, they can at least statistically determine how many people hold senior positions, how many people hold junior positions; how many people are involved in ordinary administrative work, and how many people are involved in professional technical work; what is the average annual death rate? How many people retire or change careers each year? By marking these things out one by one, we can understand the overall picture of the nation's personnel. On the one hand, we can know what kind of talent is most lacking and what kind of talent urgently needs to be supplemented, as a reference for holding various types of examinations; on the other hand, we can use temporary examinations and regular performance appraisals to eliminate those who do not meet the standards, and gradually promote those who pass the examinations. By gradually promoting in this way, we can link the relationship between examination and appointment, and slowly achieve consistency in the quantity of both.</p>
<p>(2) Qualitative Improvement: The progress of the times is constantly changing. The "private secretary" organization and the "bureaucratic" style are no longer applicable to the era of democracy and science. Today, only people with many talents and abilities are sufficient to manage the public and shoulder the affairs of the state. The role of the examination is to eliminate mediocrity and select true talent to serve the country. If the threshold is too low, mediocre people will be promoted, losing the original intention of selecting officials. However, the best way to improve the quality of officials is to proceed separately, starting from the root. That is, the examination authorities and the education authorities should maintain close contact. Examinations are about getting talent, and talent comes from schools. Without good education, how can there be excellent talent? Without talent, how can there be examinations! Since the War of Resistance, due to the unease of wartime emotions and the inadequacy of material conditions, the level of education has inevitably declined slightly. How to try to remedy this in the future, so that the young students in school can all become useful talents to the country, is something that the examination and education authorities should pay attention to. Secondly, the examination authorities should establish objective standards when holding various types of examinations, and be strict in the selection process, preferring to have vacancies rather than to admit unqualified people, preferring to be precise rather than to be too lenient, preferring to go too far rather than not far enough. If we can do this, I think the quality of officials will improve day by day, and at the same time, the function of the examination will become more and more prominent.</p>
<p>(3) Strengthening the Power of Appointment Review: Today, it is almost impossible for the personnel promotion and demotion of all institutions to come solely from examinations. Because: (1) Although China has had an examination system for a long time, whenever there is a time of decline and chaos, the laws are abandoned, and personal feelings are valued in the appointment of people, without a spirit and habit of abiding by the law. The so-called "when one person attains enlightenment, even his dogs and chickens ascend to heaven," this style still has remnants. (2) A group of unscrupulous scholars all regard becoming an official as a talisman and making money as a goal. They are often driven by the desire for profit and run through the back door, without any sense of shame, and abandon the right path of examination. (3) The National Government has been established for less than twenty years. In the autumn of its founding, all streams advanced together, most of which did not belong to the scope of examinations; and there were so-called "recommendation" methods and "exception" discussions. There are many ways to become an official, and the examination is not the only limit. But despite the reality, we should not be satisfied with the reality, but think about ways to improve it. The so-called ways to improve can be divided into two aspects: on the one hand, the law on the appointment of civil servants should be revised to reduce the qualification clauses and emphasize the spirit of examination; and another powerful and effective control is to strengthen the power of appointment review. All institutions must go through the stage of review when hiring new personnel. The Ministry of Personnel has the great responsibility of handling the review of appointments, and should use this as an opportunity for the promotion and demotion of talent. Those who do not meet the standards and regulations should be rejected and not used, waiting for the qualified talents who pass the examination. In this way, not only can the authority of the examination be established, but also the personnel who pass the examination will no longer feel the difficulty of distribution and the difficulty of promotion.</p>
<p>The above three points are my humble suggestions to the examination authorities. Finally, I would like to express my hopes for those who pass the examination.</p>
<p>(A) There must be performance: Among those who pass the examination and start working in the organization, there are many who gain the trust of their superiors and the love of their colleagues; but there are also many who are placed in unimportant positions and regarded as idlers. When we examine the reasons for this, we either say that the ability of those who pass the examination is not necessarily better than those who have not taken the examination, or we say that their experience is lacking. I think a person who is willing to participate in the examination and has passed the examination, his ability will not be too bad. Perhaps he is not used in the right place, so that his ability has no place to develop, or even is wasted. But in any case, I always hope that comrades who have passed the examination must be self-reliant, firm, and overcome all difficulties, demonstrate their own abilities, use their performance to show the value and dignity of the examination system, and use their performance to eliminate the criticism of others and strive for legal protection.</p>
<p>(B) There must be a spirit of learning: Comrades who pass the examination, except for those who are older and more experienced, do have insufficient experience and inevitably suffer criticism from society. But talent is developed through experience, and experience is accumulated. There is no one in the world who is born with experience. As long as you are willing to be humble, you are willing to learn, and you can persevere and persist, then no matter how big or small the matter is, there will be a day when you will be proficient in it.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the "institutional school" movement, which is to impart education in work, so that some young civil servants can learn from experienced superiors and colleagues. Therefore, I hope that comrades who pass the examination will always maintain a humble attitude and a spirit of learning. With this spirit of learning, we will not be "complacent" and will be able to make constant progress.</p>
<p>(C) There must be a concept of national scholars: The national scholars referred to here are different from the national scholars advocated by Yu Rang in the past. Yu Rang said, "When Zhongxing treats me like an ordinary person, I will repay him like an ordinary person; when Zhibo treats me like a national scholar, I will repay him like a national scholar." That is only out of a selfish thought, targeting only the individual, not the country. I believe that the meaning of a national scholar should be that those who are capable of governing the country can be called national scholars; at the same time, national scholars must be loyal to the country and know only the public and not the private in everything, in order to be worthy of the name. Comrades who pass the examination are the talents selected by the country, and they should not fail to be those who are capable of governing the country. Therefore, they must develop a patriotic and national salvation enthusiasm, do their best to repay the country, and be "public and just" to everyone and everything. Absolutely do not use public office for private gain or favor one over another because of personal grievances, local interests, temporary likes and dislikes, and praise and criticism. I hope that comrades who pass the examination can take the lead in cultivating this new concept of national scholars, to persuade those who value party and personal interests.</p>
<p>At this time when the country is actively building and needs talent, and also at the time when the Annual Meeting of the Examination and Political Science Association is held, I am only offering my foolishness as a humble gift. (September 12, 1946, in Nanjing)</p>

<p>Female Refugee Student Appeals for Educational Aid</p>
<p>Editor: I am one of the young students who fled from northern Jiangsu (a graduate of the Second Temporary Middle School). I am currently seeking an education, but I cannot fulfill my wishes due to economic reasons. I read in the newspaper that the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association had 100 million yuan to distribute to refugee students from northern Jiangsu. This reignited my hopes of returning to school. I immediately sent a letter to the association, asking for assistance, and attached my refugee registration number to prove that I was indeed a refugee student. Unexpectedly, after the letter was sent, it disappeared without a trace. I have been admitted to the first year of high school at the private Peiming Girls' High School. The school fees are very expensive, and my family really cannot afford it. What I am looking forward to is waiting for the relief association to give me a sum of relief money. The relief money obtained from various fundraising methods in Shanghai is more than 100 million yuan, but it cannot help the refugee students from northern Jiangsu, which I deeply regret! There are many refugee students from northern Jiangsu who are in the same situation as me. In line with the principle of cultivating talents for a hundred years, I respectfully appeal to the authorities to allocate some of this huge sum of money for the relief of refugee students from northern Jiangsu to students who are homeless and have been admitted to school but cannot attend. In that case, I will be grateful for the rest of my life. I also pray that a comprehensive investigation will be conducted to avoid omissions, which would be even more grateful. (Ji Yu)</p>
<p>Please Establish an Engineering Night School</p>
<p>Editor: After reading your newspaper's editorial on the 18th, on the one hand, I feel very admired, and on the other hand, it sparked my thoughts.</p>
<p>I am a high school graduate. After graduation, due to economic and other reasons, I had to give up my wish to continue my studies and enter the workforce. For the past two years, I have used my spare time to read some science magazines and review my old math and science textbooks. I have even completed a calculus textbook on my own. But this self-study, which requires twice the effort for half the results, cannot satisfy my thirst for knowledge. So I thought of a work-study program. But I was very disappointed. Among the existing universities, only Soochow University has a night school for the business school, and there is also an industrial night school, which enrolls students once every two months. The rest are cram schools and the like. There is no proper engineering night school. I believe that in this city, there must be many young people who are interested in industry and who are living the same life as me, wanting to satisfy their thirst for knowledge but unable to, and are waiting for the emergence of an engineering night university. (Like the former Lester Industrial Vocational School night school) (Zhang Linyi)</p>
<p>Iron Factory Apprentices Cannot Afford Medical Treatment</p>
<p>Editor: I am a little apprentice in an iron factory. On the afternoon of the 6th, I accidentally broke my finger. I immediately went to the "Labor Hospital" for treatment. Unexpectedly, the staff at the registration office wanted a registration fee of 2,000 yuan, which is half a month's salary for me, and I don't even know where to get the money for food? So I went back to the factory and let it heal naturally. I remember seeing a plaque inside that said "Benefit Our Laborers" when I treated my foot last time. I think we should do this "benefit" in the future! (Little Apprentice)</p>
<p>Ginling Women's University Enrollment Did Not Show Favoritism</p>
<p>Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences Admissions Committee Letter (excerpt) The school's enrollment is always fair, and there is no favoritism or lobbying. In this enrollment in Shanghai, more than 30,000 people applied, and only more than 60 regular students and more than 20 alternate students were admitted. Due to the limited number of places, those who failed were inevitably resentful. Also, a total of six students from Jinde Girls' High School applied, and only one was admitted, which shows that there was no preferential treatment for Jinde students. Even graduates of the school's affiliated high school must participate in the same entrance examination and receive no special treatment. These facts are known to all, so what the contributor said is not true. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Can I Get Into a Metropolitan Hospital?</p>
<p>Editor: I just came to Shanghai from Qingdao. Because my child suffers from a mental illness, I was introduced to Dr. Wang by a friend. I went to a hospital on Fumin Road last night and took my child out of the hospital this afternoon. In fact, I was only in the hospital for one day, but I was charged for two days, for a total of 110,000 yuan. When I went to the hospital yesterday, I paid 50,000 yuan, which was reduced by 40,000 yuan, and I still owed more than 20,000 yuan. I had to exchange my only gold ring to pay it off before I could leave the hospital. Looking back at my child, his condition is still the same as yesterday, and has not been reduced by a fraction. Alas! The hospitals of the big city, the doctors of the big city, the medical ethics of the big hospitals and big doctors! (Wang Qi)</p>
<p>The Hospital Service Department Charges Too Much</p>
<p>Editor: Because I am weak and often sick, I went to the Sino-American Hospital on the 30th of last month to check my physical condition, which cost 30,000 yuan. I heard that the hospital has a social service department, which specializes in serving the poor, but the fees are so expensive, which is inevitably contrary to the purpose of service.

<h3>Reader Reply: Legal Inquiries</h3>
<p>(1) Forced Property Transfer</p>
<p>Zhao Kaijia asks: In the 28th year (of the Republic), a certain Mr. Jia opened a travel agency in a certain place, acting as manager. Later, a certain Mr. Yi, coveting the agency, colluded with the enemy's constable to arrest Mr. Jia, falsely accusing him of contacting Central Government personnel with the intent to frame him. After much mediation by others, Mr. Yi declared that he would only release Mr. Jia on the condition that he take over the travel agency. Mr. Jia reluctantly agreed to the transfer. After the victory (of the war), Mr. Yi fled without a trace, and the county government sealed up the travel agency. Recently, Mr. Yi has been using his corrupt influence to lobby the county government to lift the seal. It is said that the county government has already approved the request. Although Mr. Jia has filed a lawsuit based on reason, it has been ineffective. I would like to ask: (1) What kind of procedures should be used to recover the original property from Mr. Yi? (2) Can this case be directly negotiated with Mr. Yi? (3) The only evidence currently available is the account books from the 28th year to the 32nd year. The share certificates and other documents have been seized by Mr. Yi. Will this have any impact on future litigation?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers:] If Mr. Jia's travel agency was indeed subject to Mr. Yi's collusion with the enemy's constable to arrest Mr. Jia with the intent to harm him, and Mr. Yi declared that he would only release Mr. Jia on the condition of taking over the travel agency, and Mr. Jia reluctantly agreed to the transfer, then Mr. Jia's expression of transfer was due to coercion. According to Article 92 of the Civil Code, Mr. Jia may revoke his expression. However, Article 93 of the Civil Code stipulates that the revocation mentioned in the previous article must be made within one year after discovering the fraud or the termination of the coercion. Furthermore, Article 7 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation states that if the period for exercising rights stipulated in the Civil Code or local laws cannot be observed due to war, the rights may still be exercised within two years after the implementation of these regulations. However, if the original stipulated period is shorter than two years, it may only be exercised within six months after the implementation of these regulations. This supplementary regulation was promulgated and implemented on December 18, 1945, and expired on June 18 of this year. However, if the county government's sealing was based on Mr. Jia's lawsuit against Mr. Yi, and it occurred before June 18 of this year, then it can be considered that Mr. Jia has already taken action to revoke. Now, I will answer the listed questions separately as follows: (1) Lawsuits or negotiation procedures can be used within the statutory period. (2) The revocation in Article 92 of the Civil Code originally involves direct negotiation, but it should be done within the statutory period. (3) The emphasis of the evidence is on proving coercion.</p>
<p>(2) Mortgage Loan</p>
<p>Hong Dongling asks: In the 25th year (of the Republic), a relative of mine borrowed money from my mother because he had no capital to start a business. Since there was no cash on hand, he mortgaged a house, an inheritance from my late father, to a certain Mr. Jia for 700 yuan. It was agreed that the term would be three years, and Mr. Jia would be free to dispose of the property after the term expired. From that day on, Mr. Jia would collect rent to offset the interest. The agreement was signed by my mother and my wife, and my father-in-law was the guarantor. It was not signed or agreed to by me. Now, my mother and wife have passed away one after another. I would like to ask: (1) Is the agreement still valid? (2) In order to comply with my mother's will, I intend to repay 200 times the amount, but Mr. Jia insists on 500 times. I don't know if this deed can be reported lost to the Land Administration Bureau and denied. (3) If the agreement is legal, what are the redemption procedures?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers:] (1) A mother who mortgages the real estate inherited from her late father by her adult son, or the real estate inherited from her late father jointly inherited with her son, without the son's consent, the adult son can deny the mortgage. However, the son should be responsible for paying off the debt borrowed by the mother after her death. (2) The increased payment for repaying debts is currently subject to fair assessment by the court, and there are no other standards. In order to avoid the tightness of litigation, it seems better to settle amicably. Regarding the recovery of the deed, if a settlement cannot be reached, it can be handled concurrently when suing to deny the mortgage. If it is falsely claimed that it is lost, it will be inconsistent with the facts. As for whether or not to donate to charity, it is also irrelevant to the recovery of the deed. (3) Refer to the answers in (1) and (2) for clarification.</p>

<h3>Drama Education</h3>
<p>— Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>Because dramatic performance itself already possesses a certain educational significance, drama education has been misunderstood. It is believed that as long as the content or theme of the play performed contains moral implications, it can be called educational drama. In fact, this view is not sufficient to correctly explain the meaning of drama education.</p>
<p>This statement refers to the effect of dramatic performance on the audience (i.e., art connoisseurs). Thus, this performance must be a mature artistic activity, and therefore the drama performances of students and children will be rejected. In fact, the most active field of art education is primary and secondary schools. Secondly, strictly speaking, any work of art is moral, especially drama. Therefore, works like Oedipus Rex, Camille, and Salome are all moral, let alone others. Of course, we can call those with clear moral consciousness educational drama, but this is not the main part of drama education.</p>
<p>Music, fine arts, and other arts in art education all educate children from the art activity itself (creation). Therefore, drama education must also educate children from the drama activity itself. The entire process of a performance includes a wide range of activities, simply a concrete representation of the entire life and society. Therefore, the scope of drama education is extremely broad. Also, because the movement of the human body is the most basic activity, its influence on the mind is extremely deep; therefore, the effectiveness of drama education will be extremely great.</p>
<p>Now, I will explain drama education as follows: Drama education is a type of art education. Its scope of activity is mainly in primary and secondary schools, targeting youth and children. Drama education teaches through dramatic activities (mainly performance), which is also a creative behavior. As for the method of educating viewers through acting, although it is also a part of drama education, it is not an important object of research in today's drama education because it has been practiced for a long time both in China and abroad.</p>
<h3>Love Bravely! Reading "Romeo and Juliet"</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiong</p>
<p>The great Shakespeare left us "Romeo and Juliet". Let us know: "Youth is easy to pass away" and "The sacredness, sublimity, and greatness of love".</p>
<p>This pair of characters representing youth and love; Romeo and Juliet. Although hatred and obstacles are in front of them, they cannot stop their union.</p>
<p>Pure love always follows youth. Only with lofty feelings and pure hearts can one obtain true love.</p>
<p>In a person's life, youth only occupies a few short years. When Cupid's forehead is revealed, don't hide!</p>
<p>Romeo and Juliet. They ignore the hatred between the two families, the obstacles in front of them, and the sadness of the future; they tightly grasp youth and love boldly. They are the ones who truly understand life!</p>
<p>What is hateful are the stubborn parents, forcing their children to marry someone who is not loved. These stubborn parents have killed the youth and lives of many lovely young people. They have destroyed the love of many lovers and trampled on the wills of many lovers! Until now, this unreasonable demand still exists. Children with wavering wills and weak personalities are still acting as lambs on the altar! Young people should be liberated from the altar! Resist stubborn parents! Eliminate the remnants of feudalism, escape from the cage, and go to the free world! Think about the happiness of the future.</p>
<p>If it weren't for Old Capulet forcing the lovely Juliet, why would she have to use death to conceal her unwillingness! If it weren't for Old Capulet seizing Juliet's will, how could he have caused this pair of lovely youth figures to burn in the flames of love!</p>
<p>A person, from the moment they are born, has already decided their fate as a slave! As long as they are human, they cannot escape this cruel decision. They cannot live like a master, unaffected by anything, unconstrained by anything, uncontrolled by anything. They will obey their own fate like a slave! These slaves with different fates! When you have no love, what else do you cherish in this world?</p>
<p>God created mankind: giving life and love; if God takes back love and only leaves life to people, there will be no warmth in human life. What difference is there between this and a moving clay sculpture!</p>
<p>When you have no love, or your love is rejected, you will feel that life is uninteresting and disappointed in the future! You will hate, hate yourself for why you were born into this world!</p>
<p>Since there has been culture, many great writers and artists have been depicting love in the world! Until now, it has never been interrupted. Shakespeare's greatest work, "Romeo and Juliet", not only tells us about the sacredness and sublimity of love, but also tells us: Youth is so easy to pass away.</p>
<p>Young Romeos and Juliets, hold on tightly to your youth, don't let it slip away stealthily! When Cupid descends, love bravely! Don't let down the life and love that God has given you!</p>
<h3>Subei Dialect</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The Subei Fellow Association believes that the use of Subei dialect by the petty traitor in "Home of Loyalty and Righteousness" is deliberately insulting to Subei compatriots. In fact, you can't deny that he is Chinese because he speaks the dialect of that place. If it caused protests from Chinese compatriots because he spoke Chinese.</p>
<p>This makes it too difficult for art workers.</p>
<p>New singers Keiser Grelson and Hailin in the film "Seven Affections Flower"</p>
<h3>Seven Affections Flower</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Pastner is the film producer who created Diana Duping. Almost every one of Diana's singing films is his masterpiece. Now he has joined MGM. "Seven Affections Flower" is the first film he produced at MGM.</p>
<p>"Seven Affections Flower" is a musical film about seven sisters running an inn in a small town in Michigan, USA – seven beautiful Misses. The village has always preserved the customs left by Dutch immigrants and holds the annual Tulip Festival.</p>
<p>Katherine Grayson is the youngest daughter of the innkeeper. In the season of flowers all over the fields, she falls in love with a reporter who comes to cover the flower festival news. The story is simple and gentle, without shocking or dangerous scenes, and without sad or melancholic atmosphere. It is just a faint human touch, mixed with a faint smile, and the beautiful rural background dotted with Grayson's soft songs.</p>
<p>Grayson has an extremely melodious and beautiful singing voice (and is of course very beautiful). According to the miss, after signing a contract with MGM, she received very strict vocal training, and also learned other arts such as makeup, beauty, and expression. Therefore, Grayson represents a new group in Hollywood, the so-called "stars of tomorrow" who have received new specialized training.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can boldly say: Pastner is creating a second Diana Duping.</p>
<h3>Makeup and Color</h3>
<p>— Wenquan</p>
<p>Makeup is a necessary procedure and work in completing the external expression of an actor's role. It is one of the earliest assumptions and earliest completed creations in the actor's entire artistic creation process. In any performance situation, it must fully achieve its purpose. Under the highly sophisticated lighting and color usage in modern theaters, makeup must also be meticulously implemented with complete materials. Conversely, if performing in rural squares and open-air theaters, the makeup method should be changed to a simple and exaggerated technique. The use of masks in ancient Greek and Roman dramas was also an extreme exaggeration to meet the needs of a large audience.</p>
<p>In the actor's art, makeup is a static part of the character's stage image. Its expression is non-instantaneous and discontinuous. And its change must be completed during the intermission. Therefore, it must be handled with the knowledge of using invariance to respond to change, and it can coordinate the unity and vividness of various colors of light and emotions.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned differences from acting, the materials of makeup are also taken from outside the actor himself. Therefore, it is often ignored by general actors as not belonging to a part of their own art. At the same time, in order to value their own distorted star identity, they often ask the makeup manager to do the makeup for them (if it is just asking for technical help in a certain part, it is another matter). I ask, for the role you are most familiar with, do you want others to give you the appearance? Can this fact of disharmony of body and mind promote the completion of your art?</p>
<p>Although the expression result of makeup contains the technical factors of the implementer, this technique must never become a mechanical and formulaic habit. The requirements of modern drama makeup are just like the script is taken from a wide range of life—various races, classes, and different knowledge, different ages, and different personalities. At the same time, the realistic components must be increased or decreased according to the performance type of each play. For example, in Chinese abstract old dramas, if you abolish the mask and replace it with realistic makeup, it will also destroy its unity. Conversely, applying it to all dramas will become neither donkey nor horse, and will not become art.</p>
<p>All colors originate from light. As mentioned repeatedly before, the manifestation of light and color and dyeing, as well as the contrast between colors, have also been described separately. Therefore, the equipment of various colored lights in a complete makeup room also requires actors to have a very correct understanding of color science. There is a detailed record of the use of stage colors in each play. Then, using this detailed record in conjunction with colored oil paint for makeup can give the audience the correct effect. In other words: "Colored oil paint matched with prepared stage colors is the true makeup color." Using this color for makeup can achieve the correct effect.</p>
<h3>About Spring Cold</h3>
<p>— Liu Yu</p>
<p>The theme of the play "Spring Cold," recently staged at the Lyceum Theatre, is exactly the same as Ibsen's "An Enemy of the People." The protagonist of "Spring Cold," the old doctor, is a person who bravely stands up, regardless of all the obstacles of social evil forces, and calls for justice and seeks happiness for the public everywhere. For the sake of public health, he carried out the water storage tank water work. He spared no effort, not for personal gain. Even when he was so lonely that he could almost collapse, he still straightened his chest, determined to implement his own proposition and realize his ideals. Anyone can change their course after experiencing countless setbacks and turn with the wind, but this old doctor is not shaken by any evil forces. He even gritted his teeth at the end and announced the secret to his battle with the evil forces: "Hit them in their vital points!"</p>
<p>Ibsen's "An Enemy of the People" also describes the problem of Yonghe bacteria; in "An Enemy of the People," he also created a fighting character who fights against social evil forces.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot help but say that the author of "Spring Cold" was influenced by Ibsen. But Ibsen's "An Enemy of the People" was published in 1882, while the birth of "Spring Cold" was more than half a century later. From this, it can be seen that a great masterpiece has permanent value because it can discover and refine the laws of truth—this law of truth is the theme of literary and artistic creation, and it is also the substance and bones of a work.</p>
<h3>A Week of Film Reviews</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>The box office situation of this week's films is still the same as last week: "Bathing Beauty" and the domestic film "Home of Loyalty and Righteousness" are the best. Four shows a day, every show is full.</p>
<p>Bathing Beauty</p>
<p>The film has a good opening. Red Skelton is much more lively than Esther Williams. The film's editing is not as good as the direction, and the direction is not as good as the acting.</p>
<p>Destination Tokyo</p>
<p>The theme is serious. John Garfield's landing work is not outstanding, which is the failure of the play. The removal of the time bomb is very good.</p>
<p>The Doughgirls</p>
<p>According to the plot, the director should be able to please the audience, but the result is a failure, so there are several places that should be very pleasing but lack a breath. The ending is an example.</p>
<p>The scene of killing Linda Darnell is very clean.</p>
<p>Linda Darnell doesn't have many scenes, and because this type of role is easy to please, it can't be said to be successful. The protagonist, Wright Krieger, is only competent and above. George Sanders' character is not written well enough, and the acting is too simple.</p>
<p>Lady on a Train</p>
<p>The director introduces Deanna Durbin with a three-part sequence of the car, the station, and calling the police, which is not bad. The scene where the villain steals back the sleeping shoes has excellent camera work. The camera moves out from beside Deanna while she is singing, circles the garden, and goes to the villain's back outdoors. Although Deanna is not seen in this scene, she is the center of it.</p>
<p>Can't Help Singing</p>
<p>Although the story belongs to a farce, it lacks rigor; the character Dorothy Lamour in the latter part does not seem to have a good connection with the previous part. The overall performance of the film is not as good as the previously screened "They Got Me Covered."</p>
<p>Bob Hope is still very lively, while Dorothy Lamour is rigid. If you only have one purpose—to relieve boredom—then it is still a good film.</p>
<p>Actors</p>
<p>(1) Red Skelton, in "Bathing Beauty"</p>
<p>(2) Edward Everett Horton, in "Lady on a Train"</p>
<p>(3) Wright Krieger, in "The Doughgirls"</p>
<h3>Gu Zhongyi Lectures on Dramatic Structure</h3>
<p>— Chen Mo</p>
<p>Structure is the soul of drama. Structure is to use economical means and clever methods to grasp the audience, not letting them have a single moment of relaxation until the end. The structure of drama is a very strict organizational method. A part of the structure depends on talent, and a part also depends on training. To talk about the structure of drama, the first thing to study is the center of drama. The center of drama is not in the characters but in the actions. There is no irrelevant person, no irrelevant thing, and no irrelevant word in the drama. A drama without a climax is a flat drama.</p>
<p>The structure of a play is mainly divided into three parts: beginning, development, and ending. The opening of any play must attract the audience's attention, curiosity, suspicion, sympathy, or disgust, and there should also be foreshadowing. Development is based on the facts presented in the opening. The main effect of the play is in this scene. To make the actions in the lining drama fully and concretely expressed, and at the same time maintain the audience's interest, the actions in that tragedy must be developed in a complex and intricate way, and displayed in continuous crises. Crisis is the focus of emotions in the development of a play, that is, those situations that contain an emotional conflict. The ending of the play first seeks clarity. The audience must not have any doubts. The development of the actions in the play, and the psychology of the audience, should be reasonable. But the ending should not be too hasty.</p>
<p>Aristotle said: "Structure includes three points: (1) The length of the play. The play should not be too long or too short. Within a period of time, the whole play should be performed perfectly. The time is two to three hours. (2) Structure: Divided into three points: A beginning, B middle, C ending. The beginning must cause the occurrence of complex situations. Development must rely on the continuous display of the law of cause and effect. The ending is the summary of the whole play. And the most feared in the causal relationship are two points: (1) coincidence, (2) irrelevance.</p>
<p>The structure of drama from Greece to the present is divided into two major schools: (1) The classical school method. Emphasizing the unity of the three unities: time, place, and action. (2) The romantic school method. Ignoring all restrictions.</p>
<p>The classical school relies on integrity, compactness, and unified atmosphere. The disadvantage is that the scope is too small; it is easy to be far-fetched, artificial, and the development of the character's personality is greatly restricted, or even no development.</p>
<p>The romantic school selects dramatic scenes with a large scope, richer content, and the characters have the opportunity to develop as much as possible. The disadvantage is that the structure is easy to loosen, not compact enough, and there is no complete atmosphere and emotion.</p>
<p>These two methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the subject matter and the author's interest to decide the choice of method.</p>
<p>The ordinary classical school uses Greek tragedy as a blueprint, and the romantic school uses Shakespeare's plays as a demonstration.</p>
<p>In the structure of drama, using two methods is the most effective and can best grasp the audience's emotions until the end of the play.</p>
<p>One is "expectation". That is, the most important crisis or the main trend of action in the play, like waves, one wave after another, makes the audience's emotions roll into the flood tide of the plot, and an expectant heart expects how this crisis will be resolved, how it will end, until the end of the play, the problem that the audience expects is finally understood.</p>
<p>The second is "opposite". The crisis is coming, discovered by the audience, but the people in the play do not know it. The result of the play is the opposite of what the audience hopes. The people in the play do not know that they are taking the wrong path, approaching failure and death step by step, until they clearly recognize their situation, but it is irreparable. But his crisis is always seen very clearly by the audience, and they deeply worry about him, expect him, but watch him taking the opposite path from what the audience hopes until he is destroyed!</p>

<h3>Inventions and Creations</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>Scientific inventions and artistic creations bring material and spiritual happiness to humanity, exuding the noble meaning of truth, goodness, and beauty in life. William Harvey's old theory from 1300 years ago established the most glorious record in the 17th-century history of medicine.</p>
<p>The genius writer Leonardo da Vinci, based on anatomical research, proved 450 years ago that humans could also use scientific methods to soar in the sky like birds. At the time, he was subjected to people's criticism and ridicule. Fortunately, relying on his outstanding talent for painting, he completed the masterpieces "Mona Lisa" and "The Last Supper," which overshadowed his achievements in science and medicine.</p>
<p>Yun Shouping and Wang Shigu were equally famous in their time. Yun was ashamed to be second in China, abandoning landscapes and specializing in flowers and birds, bringing a unique brilliance to the Eastern art world. Shi Tao commented, "Before the ancients established laws, we do not know which laws they followed. After the ancients established laws, we do not allow modern people to go beyond the ancient laws. For thousands of years, this has made modern people unable to stand out. How unjust!" This spirit of creation is the essence of an artist.</p>
<p>Confucius said politely, "Transmitting, not creating, believing in and loving antiquity." This was misunderstood by lazy countrymen, who used imitation to replace invention and creation, affecting the progress of Chinese scholarship as a whole.</p>
<p>Fascism has fallen, and Germany and Italy have collapsed. Back then, Hitler discriminated against Jews, and Professor Einstein has since been hired by the United States to teach at the highest institution of learning.</p>
<p>Science and art that create peace and happiness are not controlled by time and space. They transcend any era and nation, and they want to infuse new blood, permeating the hearts of all mankind.</p>
<h3>Exploring "Shi Tao's Sayings on Painting" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wei</p>
<p>From these few paragraphs, we know that Shi Tao's "brush and ink" came from "accepting responsibility." This theory of accepting responsibility is like the corresponding, non-action doctrine of Lao Tzu and Zhuangzi. As long as he emphasizes the depth of brush and ink, the flexibility of the wrist, and the emptiness and wonder, it comes from "intelligence and detachment" (that is, Lao Tzu's emptying the mind, filling the belly, weakening the will, and strengthening the bones), to embody the ultimate principle of "non-action yet action, non-transformation yet responding to transformation." Only in this way can one fully utilize brush and ink and fulfill the entire responsibility of the day. Achieving "accepting things without form, fitting forms without a trace," "moving peaks as if already formed, wielding the brush as if non-acting, a small piece of paper containing heaven and earth, mountains, rivers, and all things, while the heart is indifferent." It is also the true meaning of Zhuangzi's Cook Ding dissecting an ox and the craftsman of Ying wielding an axe. As Lao Tzu said, "One who travels well leaves no tracks." In fact, these are all rules, the most brilliant laws. So if we say that Shi Tao has laws and rules, then it should belong to this category. In fact, an artist who can be admired by all living beings must be someone who best understands the "laws" and "rules" of life.</p>
<p>"How to obtain this law" and "rules"? This requires talking about "the One Stroke," which also involves the question of the origin of Shi Tao's artistic conception. To understand the One Stroke, we must first talk about its source. Turning to the first chapter of "Sayings on Painting":</p>
<p>"In ancient times, there was no law, and the primordial simplicity was not dispersed. Once the primordial simplicity was dispersed, laws were established. Where are the laws established? Established in the One Stroke. The One Stroke is the origin of all beings and the root of all phenomena."</p>
<p>These few words can summarize the birth of Shi Tao's artistic conception, and also the origin of the universe and all things. This, of course, should be said to be Shi Tao's own mind taking in the universe. But I also want to say that he borrowed a huge background: the Taoist thought, representing Eastern nourishment, to assist in its incubation. Lao Tzu, Chapter 28:</p>
<p>"When the uncarved block is split, it is made into implements." And Chapter 42:</p>
<p>"The Tao produces one, one produces two, two produces three, and three produces all things."</p>
<p>The uncarved block is complete, but it is not without use. If there is use, there must also be a distributing function. Therefore, it is dispersed and made into implements (implements refer to use, which is what Lao Tzu called "one produces two," where "one" refers to this inherent "sameness," the master that the equator reaches and returns to). "The Doctrine of the Mean": "Because it is unique and not twofold, it produces things unfathomably" (responding to this and achieving mutual benefit, hence the sage holds to one and becomes the model for the world). From this, we can know the importance of this "one," this "sameness," in the universe. "Understanding the One" is to use it to discover all "differences." Shi has a deep understanding of this, but because his position is in painting, he uses the "clarity" of the "One Stroke" to understand all "differences," achieving the "transformation" of the One Stroke. Furthermore, the chapter on Entrusting Responsibility says:</p>
<p>"Responsibility does not lie in breadth, but in controlling what is possible."</p>
<p>"Controlling" means regulating. Inheriting clarity from sameness all originates in his complete and undivided worldview. Although the principle of the One Stroke lies in the complete uncarved block, the method of the One Stroke is "hidden in use by man." This is what was mentioned above, how Shi Tao discovered a "self," what a brilliant awakening. The "self" comes from sympathy for things. (Indian scientist Tagore's 1926 article on the meaning of art, given at the Deccan School in Bengal, India, also expounds this idea). The "self" is only an individual, but to express the complete mystery of the universe, it cannot be done without the individual. Shi Tao was able to discover the "self" in the existence of all things, understand the existence of all things from the existence of the individual "self," and meet the "sameness" in their reality, achieving the wonderful use of the One Stroke (the gate of all wonders), thereby connecting all uses. The chapter on the One Stroke:</p>
<p>"Traveling far and climbing high all starts from a small patch. The One Stroke encompasses everything beyond the primordial chaos. Even billions of brushstrokes all start from this and originate from this."</p>
<p>Only by enriching the completeness of the individual can there be a mutual and related effect with billions of brushstrokes (using use to achieve essence). Shi Tao calls it all laws returning to one. Therefore, the chapter on Honoring and Accepting Responsibility:</p>
<p>"The One Stroke contains all things within it, fully receiving ink. Ink receives the brush, the brush receives the wrist, and the wrist receives the heart, like the creation of heaven and the completion of earth. This is why it is received." The chapter on Combining:</p>
<p>"Exhausting the One means seeing the roots of the past masters." The chapter on Mountains and Rivers:</p>
<p>"From one to ten thousand, from ten thousand to one, transforming one into a complete whole, all the great accomplishments in the world are completed." Conversely, the chapter on Mountains and Rivers:</p>
<p>"If one is not clear, then all things are obscure. If one is completely clear, then all things are orderly." The chapter on Understanding the Law:</p>
<p>"From the heart" can enter the realm of "non-action and transformation." Because there is no action, there is no failure; because there is no attachment, there is no loss (Lao Tzu's words). Without failure and without attachment, one becomes one with heaven, and the artwork becomes a "collaboration between heaven and man." Being able to accept responsibility, understand the accumulation of nurturing life, understand the laws of reality from nurturing life (the meaning of the rotation of heaven and earth), understand the universe of transporting simplicity from the laws of the One Stroke (the effort of governing ten thousand with two), reaching the realm of harmony between heaven and man. Then, one can understand Shi Tao clearly in mind and vision, and it can be said that one has thought halfway through the philosophy of Confucianism and Taoism for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Here, the author wants to use two passages of his own to annotate Shi Tao. The chapter on the Seashore:</p>
<p>"The sea has great waves, and the mountains have hidden depths. The sea has swallowing and spitting, and the mountains have arching and bowing. The sea can entrust spirit, and the mountains can carry pulse. The mountains have layers of peaks and ranges, deep valleys and steep cliffs, towering and protruding, with mist and dew in the air, and clouds arriving, just like the great torrent of the sea and the swallowing and spitting of the sea. This is not just the sea entrusting spirit, but also the mountains residing in the sea. Even chess and astral distribution can be used to infer the source of water and the dragon's pulse. If one gains from the sea but loses from the mountains, or gains from the mountains but loses from the sea, then one must be subject to it. My reception is that the mountain is the sea, and the sea is the mountain. Knowing me through mountains and seas is all in the elegant demeanor of a person's brush and ink."</p>
<p>Nature is a great torrent, and Shi Tao is a hidden energy. Nature swallows and spits, and Shi Tao has the ability to arch and bow to it (accepting responsibility). Nature entrusts spirit to Shi Tao, and Shi Tao's dragon pulse is connected (inheriting nurturing life). These spirits of nature, Shi Tao's many secluded emotions and magnificent colors on the painting, are not just based on the entrusting of nature's spirit, but are Shi Tao and nature's spirits mutually blending. Shi Tao himself believes that he is nature, so although Shi Tao and all things can be divided, they are intimately connected in responding to spirit and connecting pulse. If we can explore the spirits of all things, we can also find where Shi Tao's bloodline is. If one obtains all the laws but loses Shi Tao, or obtains Shi Tao but loses all the laws, then it is to be subject to it for the person seeking to excavate this artist. True understanding is to see the complete and non-dual in Shi Tao and all laws, and the reason why the author dares to say so is because in the "elegant demeanor" that the master left us in brush and ink, this is what is called "Shi Tao." In the chapter on Mountains and Rivers:</p>
<p>"This is me fifty years ago, not yet separated from the mountains and rivers. It is also not discarding the essence of the mountains and rivers and making the mountains and rivers selfish. The mountains and rivers make me speak on behalf of the mountains and rivers. The mountains and rivers are born from me, and I am born from the mountains and rivers, searching all the strange peaks to make drafts. The mountains and rivers and I meet in spirit and transform in form, so in the end, it all returns to Dadizi."</p>
<p>Only in the realm of forgetting both self and things is the complete and natural value of the universe revealed—this is what is called "Dadizi."</p>
<h3>Interlude</h3>
<p>— Zi Rong</p>
<p>——Artistic Terms Series 5——</p>
<p>The English term is "Interlude." During the reign of Queen Elizabeth in England, the playwright John Heywood began to create a type of short play that could be performed in a short time as entertainment during banquets, etc., and it was named "Interlude."</p>
<h3>Problem Novels · Problem Plays</h3>
<p>——Artistic Terms Series 6——</p>
<p>This is a tendency that arose in modern literature and art. Novels that use social problems, moral problems, religious problems, women's problems, etc., arising in modern life as topics are called problem novels. When this tendency is expressed in scripts, it is called problem plays. Ibsen's plays are good examples of problem plays.</p>
<h3>Every Inch of Mountain and River, Every Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 33</p>
<p>[Previous Summary—During the eight years of the War of Resistance, millions of heroic Chinese sons and daughters in the front lines, the rear, and the occupied areas shed their bright red blood across every inch of the motherland to defend it. We have collected these tragic stories to commemorate the hardships of recovering lost territories.</p>
<p>The first story—“Seven Secret Documents”—records how the Japanese pirates colluded with several war demons in Europe, and made seven secret documents to ravage the world, to destroy all culture.</p>
<p>Young He Xiong Wang, from the cradle to the graduation of the Army University, received "aggression education." Perhaps due to pure blood, he was full of a sense of justice, and could not stand the broken style of Japanese pirates and warlords—rape, plunder, arson, murder, gambling, drug trafficking, extortion, all kinds of criminal behavior. Just as he was starting to feel disgusted, he accidentally discovered that he himself was a direct descendant of Mr. Gu Jihan, an old Tongmenghui comrade. At the same time, he heard about the content of the "Seven Secret Documents" and tried to expose them to save this disaster of widespread suffering.</p>
<p>He only had one pain—he found that he was in love with Ji Yaoqun, a beautiful and outstanding daughter of the Northeast. Fearing that he would fall into the trap of love and delay the great plan, he rushed into the tiger's den to find the "Seven Secret Documents" with a determination to die, but entrusted his close friend Yue Jun—a freelance writer—to act as the secret radio station of Changxindian, and also asked Yue Jun to introduce Yaoqun to Mr. W, the director of the East District counter-espionage organization, to participate in the work of eliminating traitors.</p>
<p>Yaoqun was also able to understand He Jian's painstaking efforts, so she stayed up all night with Little Tiger—a thirteen-year-old martial arts expert from the north—to complete the procedures for joining the ranks, and hurriedly embarked on the journey to work in Tongzhou.</p>
<p>Yue Jun went to Beiping, completed Yaoqun's affairs, and immediately prepared to work at the Changxindian regiment. At this time, it was after "July 7th," and the Wanping battle was about to break out. What lay before him was a cruel "death line"...]</p>
<h3>Galloping Horse</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Yizun</p>
<h3>Lonely Riverside at Dusk</h3>
<p>— Song Ling</p>
<p>"The sunset is infinitely good"—It is nearly dusk in early autumn! The rolling waves, green then yellow, yellow then green.</p>
<p>The edge of the island gradually entered the line of sight from afar. Where the cargo ship passed, a large yellow scar was suddenly cut open on the vast expanse of misty waves. In the air, the whistle spewed out several circles of fantastic patterns, telling people that there would be another docking soon.</p>
<p>Thousands of lives, thousands of hopes, and thousands of translations, began to stir slightly. In the ocean, the empty worries given to this small, millet-like boat were once again filled with existence.</p>
<p>For those from the mountains who have just experienced sea travel, the dock should have a special warmth.</p>
<p>When the sunset left only half of its face at the intersection of the sky and water, the ship had already berthed at the wharf; although the wind was still timidly brushing the sea, it was no longer hot and irritable inside.</p>
<p>A brewing human flow erupted like a surging torrent.</p>
<p>Passengers, goods, money... another exchange.</p>
<p>A swarm of hawkers tore their throats and shouted unfamiliar sound waves. There were old men, little girls, and young men; one basket, three cages, one basin to carry; some holding, some carrying on their heads, on the deck, on the shore... the same trembling voices, the same sallow faces, tattered clothes, and a pair of eyes shining with hazy, longing light.</p>
<p>A carrying pole, two circles of hemp rope, bare-chested coolies, spinning rapidly in the crowd, humming powerful primitive songs in the cargo hold.</p>
<p>The world is full of sounds, noisy, lively...</p>
<p>Strength is flowing everywhere...</p>
<p>In the west, faintly, the sunset intentionally or unintentionally painted the dim dusk with obscure colors.</p>
<p>A military card sped through the crowd to the dock, another frantic commotion; suddenly a sharp cry of a girl rang out! A basket of tea eggs was thrown far away with force... and on the other side, in front of that open-air food stall, someone seemed to be beating fiercely...</p>
<p>The sound, the sound of people, spread out from here and was transmitted from elsewhere. Mixed, whole, continuous, the urban atmosphere was noisy, and it was impossible to distinguish whether it was joy, anger, sadness, happiness, resentment, sighing, or elation.</p>
<p>It should be lively, powerful, or majestic! But isn't it also withered, lonely, and desolate!</p>
<p>The mysteries of life are not easy to explain seriously. From this base to another foothold, who is not experiencing hope, desire, waiting, drifting, struggling...</p>
<p>The ship floated on another, even more distant voyage, a large, yellow dragon-like footprint stretching endlessly forward...</p>
<p>Thousands of beautiful expectations are sailing and swaying.</p>
<p>The water dock faded from blurry to disappearing!</p>
<p>It should be the same! At this time, time has fallen from chaos and noise back into silence, silently watching the sun mixed with people and sea water sweep the aftermath.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 On the Death Line</p>
<p>The next morning, before dawn, Yaoqun and Little Tiger, carrying the secret order from the Action Headquarters, hurriedly embarked on their journey to work in Tongzhou. Thanks to Mr. W's kindness, he repeatedly insisted on me staying in Beiping for a day, on the one hand, to do his best as a host, and on the other hand, to take this opportunity to discuss some ways of future cooperation.</p>
<p>From Mr. W's conversation that day, I got a few reports on the national situation; but compared with the information we got from Changxindian, it seemed to be slightly different. I think the following few points are more important, now written behind, you may wish to refer to:</p>
<p>"Ping (referring to the Beiping Action Headquarters): 7.10. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a written protest to the Japanese Ambassador to China because of the illegal action on July 7th, requesting the Japanese side to fulfill (1) formally apologize to China and punish the responsible personnel; (2) compensate for all losses of deaths, injuries and destruction; (3) guarantee that similar incidents will not occur.</p>
<p>Xin (referring to the Japanese telegram received by the Changxindian secret station): Nanjing diplomats actually want to ask me for an apology, punishment, compensation, etc. in three points on the basis of the July 7th Incident. What status will this put my empire in? Where should I put the prestige of the Imperial Army? My leaders now think that this unreasonable request need not be answered, so they set it aside; because the opponent I am currently negotiating with is General Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Hebei and Chahar."</p>

<h3>Art Trafficking</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>I was chatting idly with a few friends in the art world the other day and learned that a very bad phenomenon has been popular in Shanghai recently, which they consider to be very dangerous and urgently needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is that collectors are almost entirely abandoning silk and taking paper for the collection of calligraphy and painting.</p>
<p>According to my friends, the formation of this trend is entirely due to the operation of profiteering philistine collectors. Because silk is easy to damage, and paper can be sold at a high price. Little do they know that ancient art, especially paintings before the Tang and Song dynasties or of the Tang and Song dynasties, is mostly silk. In this way, it is no different from cutting off the continuation of the life of ancient art. After a few years, the source of our cultural relics will be unknown, which is likely to lead to the annihilation of a nation's history.</p>
<p>According to this friend, Shenzhou Guoguang Society and Youzheng Book Bureau used to focus on reprinting (i.e., reproducing) books and paintings on art. Although their work was not perfect (for example, those art picture postcards only simply wrote a line next to the painting: Painted by a certain person in a certain dynasty, unlike the Japanese, they would explain the era, author, and advantages and characteristics of the painting in detail, popularize art knowledge, and guide readers to appreciate art), they still tried their best in preservation and popularization. But who is engaged in it now?</p>
<p>The worship of money is spreading fiercely and rapidly, and the people of Shanghai can't breathe. Open this skylight and let everyone wake up and improve their tastes!</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Racecourse</h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>The "Legacy" of the Old Era</p>
<p>After the "Opium War," in 1842 (the 22nd year of Daoguang), China and Britain signed the "Treaty of Nanjing," which stipulated that five ports should be opened for trade. Shanghai was officially opened as a commercial port on November 14, 1843. The Shanghai Daotai and the British Consul George Balfour negotiated and delineated the boundary line for foreign residence, which at that time only had an area of 138 acres. Later, China and Britain signed the "Supplementary Treaty of Humen," which stated in Article 7 that British people were allowed to rent land to build houses in the five trading ports, but there were no "Land Regulations" and "Settlement Regulations" at this time. It was not until 1845 that the Shanghai Daotai Gong Mu Jiu signed the "Land Regulations" of 24 articles with the British in his personal name, which became the basis for the creation of the British concession. In 1848, the American concession was established, and in 1863, the two concessions were merged into the Public Concession.</p>
<p>The "Land Regulations" of the Shanghai Concession were revised three times in 1854, 1869, and 1898. The Chinese side was not invited to send anyone to attend the revision, and they only issued a notice to China after they had made the arrangements, which became an accomplished fact. In 1904, the Shanghai Daotai issued a statement allowing the Bureau of Works to directly negotiate land with Chinese owners, and foreigners could arbitrarily expand their property rights in the concession. The current site of the racecourse originally belonged to the fourth Tu of the 25th Bao of Shanghai County. It was a deserted area, and after it was purchased by the British, the property rights became their own.</p>
<p>The first Shanghai racecourse appeared in 1850, located west of Nanjing Road and Henan Road today. It can be mutually verified by old newspapers: "From the fifth to the seventh of April, Westerners held a horse racing meeting. They enclosed several acres of land as a racecourse two miles west of the city. They built a wooden fence around the perimeter, and dug ditches outside the fence. Western men and women built high stands inside the enclosure to watch, and placed money to bet on the outcome. Several riders were dispatched at the same time, dressed in five colors to distinguish them. It was also a grand sight to chase the wind and step on electricity." After two relocations, they finally chose Jing'an Temple Road for construction and established the Racecourse General Association. Every spring and autumn, horse races were held as usual, with prizes and ticket sales, which were the same as gambling, and the profits were amazing. In May 1933, the old site was dismantled, and the magnificent new building was completed on February 10, 1934.</p>
<p>During the period when the enemy and puppet forces occupied the area, horse races were still held on the original site from time to time, but the Chinese people were not very interested in it, and the business was not prosperous.</p>
<p>Currently, the "horse racing" is revived, and there are many rumors. There will be a heated debate in the council. What will happen next? Let's wait and see for the next breakdown! However, to say something objective: whether the horse racing is restored or not depends on the government, and the absolute majority of citizens firmly oppose the opening of the horse ban! I think: the government really doesn't have to resist public opinion for this move!</p>
<h3>Tram Strike</h3>
<p>— Yiqun</p>
<p>When I came out of my house yesterday morning and walked to the tram station, I only saw a few people standing idly. The scene of queuing up like a long snake in the past no longer existed. Because the situation was abnormal, I became suspicious, so I asked the people next to me, only to know that the tram was on strike again today!</p>
<p>Later, after reading the newspaper, I learned that two tram ticket vendors were detained for assaulting someone, so all the tram workers went on strike to express their assistance or resistance? Unless the murderer is released, they will not resume work.</p>
<p>We really feel that the unity of the tram workers is quite great. In the past, they once went on strike because their request for a salary increase was not granted, and then went on strike again because they were not allowed to borrow salaries. Once, two workers fought with workers from a certain yarn factory and went on strike. Tram workers often use weapons for private disputes involving a small number of people, which seems to be too clever. Leaving aside the past, let's take yesterday's strike as an example. Two ticket vendors were detained for assaulting someone. The matter is very simple. The right and wrong must be proved by facts, and the guilt or innocence must be based on the law. If the tram workers abide by the law and understand the truth, they should handle the matter according to the law. If there is any grievance, they may as well make it public to the society and let everyone criticize it. If they say that they use strikes as weapons, threaten the law on the one hand, and try to win the sympathy of the society on the other hand, I think how is this different from climbing a tree to catch fish?</p>
<p>The tram is one of the public utilities, which is related to public transportation. Please tram workers, do not frivolously go on strike due to private disputes, so as not to hinder public transportation. You must know that the spirit of your service and the attitude towards passengers have their own public opinion. Why use weapons arbitrarily—strike!</p>

<h3>Gambling and Taxes</h3>
<p>— Yang Ren</p>
<p>I once joked with a friend: Now everything is waiting to be revived, and the national treasury is short of money. All local undertakings have no way to start. If the government can use the gambling psychology of the people and openly set up a gambling house in every township, and stipulate a "gambling tax," the income must be considerable. Then "the people are never satisfied with money, and the country gets taxes and grows richer," killing two birds with one stone. There is no better way to make money than this!</p>
<h3>"Shanghai Emperor" Long Live</h3>
<p>— Xi Ting</p>
<p>If there were an election for "Shanghai Emperor," I would definitely choose the drivers and ticket conductors of the British-owned tram company.</p>
<p>Apart from the few automobile owners, countless citizens are subjects of this emperor. When the emperor needs to collect taxes from his "people," he will say "Sorry!" in a friendly manner. (At this time, you paid two hundred yuan but only received a ticket worth one hundred and fifty yuan.) Every time they softly and kindly say "Sorry" to me, I always feel flattered and overly nervous, not knowing what to do, because I have not forgotten the emperor's intimidating face when I boarded the tram. I have not forgotten the anger I felt every time a very empty tram passed by the station without stopping, drifting away. However, it is precisely because they are so stern when they don't want me to board that when they change and become as loving as a parent to their children, I feel it is an exceptional favor, and therefore I feel obligated to pay the required "tax." Even if I am unwilling in my heart, I always comfort myself in an Ah Q-like manner: I should be a broad-minded citizen. What happened earlier should be forgiven and forgotten. Now that they are smiling and asking me for money, why should I be so stingy?</p>
<p>At the same time, I always treat the scolding of the ticket conductor emperor as imperial decrees, daring not to resist in the slightest, because otherwise, if an incident of insulting the emperor were to occur, all the emperors might go on strike, wouldn't I be guilty of a crime deserving ten thousand deaths?</p>
<p>Recently, I've heard that disputes often occur between the tram people and the tram emperors. I greatly admire the "audacity" of these "passenger subjects". I don't even dare to look at these emperors!</p>
<p>One, two, three: "Long live the Shanghai Emperor!"</p>

<h3>The Newly Appointed Vice Commander-in-Chief of the Navy - Some Facts About Gui Yongqing</h3>
<p>— Chong Zheng</p>
<p>Gui Yongqing, the head of our country's military delegation to the United Kingdom, has been summoned back to the country and honorably appointed as Vice Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, temporarily acting as Commander-in-Chief. With his current position, among those who graduated from the Whampoa Military Academy, few can compare except for Hu Zongnan, Du Yuming, and Guan Linzheng.</p>
<p>Gui is a native of Guixi, Jiangxi province, and a graduate of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. After graduation, he served in the military, from platoon leader to regimental commander. In this phase, he climbed the fastest among his first-class classmates. In the Northern Expedition, he was a brave and skilled lower-level officer, and at the time, he was highly regarded by General He Yingqin.</p>
<p>Rising Through Climbing City Walls</p>
<p>I remember once when attacking a certain county town, Chairman Chiang personally commanded and supervised the battle. After fierce fighting for several days and nights, they still couldn't break through. Unable to find a solution, he ordered General He Yingqin to organize a suicide squad. However, they had all kinds of talent, but lacked someone skilled in climbing the city walls to become an internal operative. While General He was hesitating, Gui volunteered to step forward. In reality, he didn't know how to climb city walls, it was just his courage. As a result, they captured the city in one fell swoop, creating a major victory. The Chairman was extremely pleased and immediately asked He Yingqin, what was the name of the officer who climbed the city wall? He replied, "Gui Yongqing." The Chairman immediately ordered his promotion by one rank. From then on, the names "Gui Yongqing" were deeply imprinted in the minds of the Chairman and General He Yingqin.</p>
<p>His achievements in the Northern Expedition led to his promotion to major general and commander of the Training Corps. Before the war, the Training Corps was a national model army. The officers were all from military academies, and the soldiers were intellectuals. The education was German-style, so the Training Corps was famous throughout the country and became a model unit praised and admired by the people. General Gui's fame was also largely due to leading the Training Corps.</p>
<p>When the War of Resistance broke out, the Training Corps took the initiative to participate in the war. At the time, Chairman Chiang did not want them to sacrifice themselves. However, the brave soldiers led by General Gui repeatedly insisted. Their slogan was "Loyalty to the Party and Love for the Country". When the country was in a critical moment, it was the opportunity for soldiers to defend their territory and repay the country. As a result, the Training Corps did their best. Even when only one bullet and one person remained, they continued to fight bravely. Therefore, they all made a heroic sacrifice. This spirit of not knowing personal interests was the result of General Gui's strict military training and education. However, Chairman Chiang wept bitterly after hearing the news, believing that the sacrifice of this group of energetic young soldiers was a great loss to the country!</p>
<p>Fighting in All Directions</p>
<p>After the fall of Shanghai, Gui continued to command a large army, fighting on battlefields in all directions, until after the Battle of Lanfeng, he was transferred to serve as the education director of the Military Affairs Committee Training Corps. Therefore, many people were unfamiliar with him during the War of Resistance. In fact, he had always stood on the front lines of the war. The batches of students who graduated from the Military Affairs Committee Training Corps were the result of Gui's education.</p>
<p>In 1944, Gui was ordered to serve as the head of the military delegation to the United Kingdom. After Germany surrendered, he went to Berlin to study European military affairs, and to research new military tactics with Allied generals, as well as plans for the occupation and control of Germany. He was already a figure praised by British and American military personnel.</p>
<p>Recently, General Gui Yongqing has returned to the country and has been appointed as the Vice Commander-in-Chief of the new navy. We hope that he will live up to the enthusiastic love of the people and make some achievements for the rebuilt navy!</p>
