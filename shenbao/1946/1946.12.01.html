<h3>國民大會今日休會　決設九組審查憲草　明開第六次會繼續討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕國大一日上下午　休會·熱·察·綏·寗四省國大代表聯誼會，定上午十時在大會堂休息室招待記者。又全體蒙古代表，亦定下午二時在同一地點招待記者。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京卅日電〕二日上午十時舉仃第六次大會，繼續討論憲法草案·國民大會秘書處已擬定憲法草案分組認定代表一種，表內計分八組，定於十二月二日第六次大會時，分送各代表簽名交議事組彙收。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三十日專電〕國民大會第五次大會於三十日晨九時五十分舉行。首由洪秘書長蘭友宣佈：「國大代表經國府公佈者一七四四人，截至今晨九時止報到者共一六三六人，本日出席者一一一八人、已足法定人數宣佈開會，由于斌主席，行禮如儀，主席宣佈：凡報到未經宣誓之代表，今日補行宣誓。旋由褚轉成至台上領導，各宣誓人仍就原位即舉手朗讀誓詞。（官誓人姓名列後）又民主社會黨曁靑年黨代表，今日上午未參加補誓，現擬擇定日期再行舉行。旋主席團第五組入主席團席，吳鐵城·朱家驊·王雲五·劉　靜等·即相繼登主席台·繼由秘書處報吿：（一）宣讀第四次大會紀錄，（二）宣讀中華民國憲法草案審査辦法案。討論開始，首由雷副秘書長解釋審委會辦法，繼即由代表自由發表意見，發言者極爲踴躍，計有宋樵述·孫繩武·胡覺·劉踪萍·陳顧遠·張施武·李楚狂·樓桐蓀·陳長蘅·衛挺生·張溉·孔庚·鍾天心·劉策成等。並提書面甚多，大會於十一時一刻休息一刻鐘，至十一時半繼續，至十二時，由于斌主席宣佈：「今日各代表所發表意見及書面意見均即交秘書處整理，由主席團會議修正後提交大會討論，如各代表續有意見發表，可一併提交秘書處整理，如無異議，即作通過。」會塲報以無異議，即宣佈通過。</p>
<p>茲誌審查辦法要點如次：中華民國憲法草案審査辦法案：說明：憲法草案經大會廣泛交換意見後，即將進入交付審査之階段，各代表有關憲法之提案，亦已陸續提出，茲經主席團決定，擬分設下列八組審査委員會：（一）第一審査委員會：「審査關於總綱人民之權利義務及選舉」（二）第二審査委員會：「審査關於國民大會及憲法之施行及修正解釋」（三）第三審査委員會：「審査關於總統行政及立法」（四）第四審査委員會：「審査關於司法考試及監察」（五）第五審查委員會：「審査關於中央與地方之權限」（六）第六審査委員會：「審査關於省縣制度」（七）第七審査委員會：「審査關於基　國策」。以上各審査委員會人選，由出席大會代表自由認定一組或二組。（八）綜合審査委員會，由各組審査委員會之召集人中，各推二人，主席團推選十五人，及各代表產生單位各推一人組織之。各組審査委員會爲便利進行，得分設若干小組分別硏究。</p>
<h3>代表意見審定後　由主席團提大會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕國大五次會上午會議各代表意見：（一）第三第四兩審　委員會應予合併，因第三審委會係審査總統行政及立法第四常委會係審查司法考試及監察。頗布　聯不必分開應合併爲一側　委會。（二）第五第六兩審委會亦應合　，因第五審委會審査中央與地方之權限，與第六審委會之省縣制度極有連繫關係。（三）綜合　查委員會應更名爲第八審査委員會　藉與以上七條名稱一律。（四）綜合委員會之組織份子應行增加，每組審査委員會僅召集人二人嫌少，應改爲各委會三人。（五）綜合委會之組成份子，各代表產生單位各推一人太少，應增爲五人。（六）審委會中應增加審査邊疆問題之審委會。（七）第六審委會審査範圍，原定爲省縣制度，現可增加「業藏地方」等。（八）各委會性質則有　聯亦不必合併，可以聯席會議方式出之。（九）　章之前　亦　規劃人審査委員會範　內（十）　委　主席團推選人數　减爲儿人。（十一）第五審委會審理範圍太大，應增設一組。（十二）分組辦法應另行劃分，如國防外交敎育等。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕國大五次會下午修正通過中華民國憲法草案審査辦法共分九組，除主席團決定之八組外，另加第八組審査委員會（審査關於蒙藏地方制度）一組。綜合審査委員會列爲第九組。（綜合審査各組相互有關之事項及全草案章節與文字之整理）。綜合審査委員會由各組審査委員會中互推一人，召集人中各推二人，主席團推選九人及各代表產生單位各推三人組織之。各審査委員會爲便利進行得分設若干小級分別硏究，必要時有關各審査委員會，得聯合審査。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕國大第五次會議，三十日下午三時三十分，繼續舉行，吳鐵城任主席。首報吿午前關於「中華民國憲法草案審査辦法」案之討論結果，正歸納中，俟主席團審定後，即提川大會討論。</p>
<h3>青年民社黨代表　未參加補行宣誓</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕卅日國大上午大會時，靑年民社兩黨代表均不出席。據聞係避免補行宣誓。靑年黨事後發表書面談話如下：「我們對於創造中華民國之孫中山先生，素來尊崇，我們對於國民黨朋友，信仰孫先生的遺敎，亦素具同情。不過目前蔣主席提交憲法草案時。曾經明白表示，從此還政於民，開始憲政。所以我們認定憲法草案所規定的信仰自由與思想自由，應當立刻實現。我們尊重國民黨朋友的信仰自由，同時保持自己的思想自由。我們不參加補行宣誓的理由，就是這樣。」民社黨無表示，但對記者問不出席是否爲宣誓問題；不加否認。問另行宣誓否？答：看政府意見。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕靑年黨國大代表左舜生卅日晚由京搭夜車來滬，今晨八時可抵此。</p>
<h3>北方代表主張　國都於北平</h3>
<p>〔山央社南京卅日電〕憲法草案第七條，關於中華民國國都之規定，爲「中華民國國都定於南京」。國民大會綏遠代表祁志厚，頃向大會提案，列舉十四項理由，主張國都定於北平。此項提案有代表于右任·張繼·莫德惠·孔德成，丁惟汾，白雲梯，薄儒·蘇珽·童冠賢，趙靑譽等三百八十人之連署。其原文如下：「爲保衛東北，鞏固國防，防止國土再被侵略起見，應建都北平，當否請公決案。」理由：（一）北平建都，接近強鄰，感覺敏銳，自易收先事預防因應咸宜之便。（二）北平形勢雄偉，可控制全局。（三）北平交通便利，爲鐵路中心。（四）北平位冀，魯，豫，晋，東北九省，熱，察，綏三省人口中心（五）北平爲將來華北建設重工業之中心。（六）北平接近東北，且海運河述便利，食糧絕可無虞，肉類並可取自蒙古一帶。（七）北平氣候凉爽，適於人類健康條件，宜於政府人員終年工作（八）北平建都，可以吸引人民向北發展，養成堅忍耐寒習慣與精神，以充實邊陲。（九）北平建都，可以均衡南北發展，打破南北隔閡。（十）北平爲歷史名都，有悠久歷史。（十一）北平臨近海洋，可兼顧海上發展。（十二）北平建築，規模宏大，足敷建都需用，無需大與土木，可以節省財力。（十三）北平爲文化巾心。（十四）北平風景幽美。</p>
<h3>各代表對憲草　廣泛發表意見　蒙古表要求明訂盟旗制度</h3>
<p>〔本報南京以卅日電〕國大各代表在卅日下午第五次大會中對憲草廣泛發表意見，茲分誌如後：蒙古代表吳雲鵬·白瑞，先後聲稱：如憲法能維護國內各民族之利益，即應自完美憲草修正案中，將第十一章「地方制度」易爲「省縣制度」，「盟」之地位忽與省並列，忽又作歧視規定，「旂」之地位絕未提起，全文中欲一見此字亦不得，但事實上外蒙獨立後，內蒙七百餘萬蒙族同胞之散布，自東北迄新疆，對北方國防關係極重要，視昔日頒行之蒙古盟旂自治法規，要求憲法上明訂盟旂制度，並非故標新異，更非分化內蒙同胞之重心力，對蒙胞應以高度同情，予以眞正平等，正所以爲鞏固國防。</p>
<p>贛區代表李中襄就憲草之目錄提出意見兩點：（一）第四至九章共六章，應合併爲一章，稱「國民政府」，以確立其治權機關之地位與第三章「國民大會」爲政權機關並列，「國民政府」章下分六節，除「總统」節依舊外，五院之「院」字應明文訂出，吾則政權治權自目錄始即欠分明，若干年後國大將趨消滅，對國父遺敎背棄無餘。（二）第十一章「省縣制度」，應修改爲「地方制度」，否則省縣以外之行政單位將無從安置。</p>
<p>遴選代表賀揚　　先述修正案巾有保障人民自由，承認黨派合法，提高地方地位等三優點，後列舉其缺點如下：（一）中央政府制度矛盾，旣非總統制，亦非內閣制，旣非一院制，亦非兩院制，旣非五權制，亦非三權制，四不象，無一是處。（二）考銓及監察制度，未充分發揮，忽略人治之成分，違反事實及傳統。（三）中央與地方權限雖巳劃分，而地方省縣間之權限欠明確。（四）民族主義精神缺乏，未顧及少數民族地位。（五）國家領土可以法律變更，不若五五憲草之規定「非經國民大會議決不得變更」穩妥。渠主張保留並擴大修正案之優點，而來除去或救補其缺點。</p>
<p>僑民代表郭新主張，（一）第一條民有，民治，民享等字樣删去。（二）第七條國都之地點不必明列於憲法中。（三）第一四五條加入「醫學」兩字。</p>
<p>皖區代表常宗有主張，國民經濟列爲專章，今後以農建國，應多注意農業。</p>
<p>遴選代表鄧家彥稱，憲草修正案中對考試監察二權之規定，實不能發揮其具有之長處。</p>
<p>川區代表陳潛溪謂，如國大制憲遵依國父遺敎，則必行五權憲法，政　治　必予劃分，今法正案由政權　　國大之權小至無有，如係依　　斯鳩則可，依中山先生則不然，　人究要五權或三權，應先決定，如要三權，儘可就議會制制定憲法，斷不能立名棄實。制憲乃百年大業，吾人不能固執衝動，亦不能百依百順。</p>
<p>區代表　　就「基大國策」發表意見兩點，（一）「國民經濟」不能籠統規定，世界各國憲法中，均列專　，且現代人類經濟社會活動日　複雜，應將五五憲草　此章提出討論，補充必要，　國計民生大有裨益。（二）「敎育」　　國　計、亦應列爲草案，五五　草　關於學齡兒童免費就學　國　教育，教育經費等規定　均　理　採。</p>
<p>社會　達　表陳孝威認爲，憲草修正案缺乏時代性及國防性，統帥權與治　權如不統一，等於無用，　其　規定之政時難爲有能實不足在「原子時代」立國，　請大會鄭重考慮。四時四十五分至五時十五分休息後，吳主席宣布，根據議事規則第卅一條，變更議事日程，先討論憲草審査辦法，當由雷副秘長報吿主席團歸納而得之修正意見，經表決後，以九五一票贊成通過「審査辦法修正稿」繼續進行廣泛討論。</p>
<p>蘇省職業代表唐啓宇提出兼採職業選舉制及詳列農業政策一一項主張。</p>
<p>婦女代表皮以書發表意見稱：（一）職業選舉制，有助於經濟雄設發展，（二）婦女占人口半數，如不能參政，不算全民政治，非眞正民主。試觀世界上任何國家，任何有這見之政黨，皆極力扶植女權，要求規定婦女在各單位選舉中應占百分之三十。</p>
<p>鄂區代表王　　主張「敎育」應列專章，並須就國情列明敎育宗旨，應規定三民主義之敎育。又社會敎育，亦應列入。</p>
<p>最後贛區代表劉家樹稱，「憲草修正案巾，立法院　國民大會之規定，全部遠　國　遺敎，須作澈底之修改，吾人爲三民主義犧牲多少先烈，流出多少血汗，萬萬不能貿然放棄革命目標，而投人資本主義之懷抱」。常博得熱烈當聲，散會時已六時正。</p>
<h3>張君勱在滬主持　民社黨中常會議</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中國民主社會黨，卅晨八時在愚園路該黨總部舉行中常會議·伍華子·徐傳霖·孫亞夫諸氏均由京返滬出席。由張君勱氏親自主持，至十二時許始散。</p>
<h3>外蒙古關謠</h3>
<p>〔塔斯社鳥蘭巴托廿九日電〕蒙古人民共和國外交部通告，日前朝鮮漢城電台播送的新聞，說蒙古人民共和國的軍隊在中國國蒙古邊境集巾，這則新聞是完全捏造的　言。</p>
<h3>蘇北收復縣　辦小本貸款</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州卅日電〕央中交農四聯　處，茲允在蘇北各收復縣內辦理小本貸款，核定每縣三億元，第一期暫撥一二〇億元，以復蘇枯竭之蘇北農村經濟</p>
<h3>東北共軍攻農安未逞　國軍進駐哈拉海　軍調部共方參謀長否認接收大連</h3>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕此間交通界息：共軍團攻東北長白綫之晨安未逞後，即一洩千里而退出該綫重鎭哈拉海，國軍旋於非八日進駐該鎭，共軍總向松花江方面退却中。</p>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕外電所傳國軍已進入大連訊，此間官方皆謂無所聞，另據交通界息：該方面共軍確已逐漸向大連集中，共約萬餘人，似準備自大連經水路運往姻台，故蓋平方面國軍亦未經戰鬥而進駐熊岳城，許家屯，萬家嶺，松横王家。復縣，迄廿八日已進至復縣前方之瓦房店，昨今情形尙不悉，瓦房店距大連尙有二百華里左右。</p>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕軍調部共產黨參謀長薛子正稱：大連無共軍，亦從未接收大連，惟大連市外有共軍活動。</p>
<p>〔本報長春卅日電）長春警備司令部新聞發布組消息，據稱：哈爾濱盛傳朱德在張家口退却戰中戰死，長市各報或轉載是項消息。</p>
<p>〔本報長春廿九日電〕共軍興築佳　期至太平屯及克利至依蘭之公路　全長七十英里，已於本月廿日通車。</p>
<h3>瀋陽警備司令　由趙家驤兼任</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽卅日電〕行轅已准趙公武辭去瀋陽警備司令之職，並派趙參謀長家駿兼任。</p>
<p>國大主席團座中（右至左）之孫科，于　任，張羣，胡適。（中國社攝）</p>
<h3>國大五次會風平浪靜</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張明　濮德玠</p>
<p>斌以主敎的神采出現在主席台上，大家都感佩其威嚴仁慈並發之意態，第一次振鈴後，于斌即首先入席端坐正中。</p>
<p>于斌　國父遺囑的聲浪，爲歷次主席所讀得最淸晣的一次。</p>
<p>靑年黨民社黨的代表，上午沒有出席，空了的座位立即引起新聞記者的嗅覺，打聽以後，才知他們希望另行擇定日期能够更加鄭重些。</p>
<p>當主席一提到討論審査委員會辦法時，立刻就有人站起來反對，他說這個案子應該到下星期六再提出來，因爲我們一千餘人，對憲草發表意見的才不過三十餘人，實未能達成廣泛交換意見的自由。隨即由副秘書長雷震表示，先討論審委會辦法，是爲各代表準備參加審査的便利，決不是目前就交審査，這一塲風波方息。</p>
<p>宣讀　委會辦法，是雷震第一次在大會上露臉，這個爲了和平商談費盡了心力的無名英雄，才第一次台上站出來，許多記者都對他有親切之感。</p>
<p>一〇九〇號忽然站起來說話：「我已兩次送了請求發言單，但至現在還是沒有機會」。主席立即說：「你現在就發言」，這種額外的民主作風，頗使發言者受寵若驚。</p>
<p>一〇九〇一開始，就溢出發言範　，雖經台下報以嗤聲及倒彩，然而他還是固執的說：「機會太少，我只說五分鐘就完」。但是羣情難予抑止，再報以嗤聲彩聲，連坐在前排的白部長也大笑起來。主席按鈴不能制止，最後他自己也發覺說了也沒人聰，多次交涉無效後悻悻然下了台，這一塲笑劇才算完結。</p>
<p>蒙古代表正上了台，在爲　疆問題發表意見的時候，某代表忽報以「嗤嗤」之聲，不一會會塲一角立即陷於混亂，原來是某代表的「嗤嗤」激動了公憤，認爲他有意剝奪邊疆代表的發言機會，一致要驅逐他出塲，一時會塲職員和記者都趕到了爭吵區域，採訪事實眞相，隨後經過　解才算風平浪靜。這是今天第二個很好的鏡　。</p>
<p>大部份女代表都特別注意到婦女的權利問題，但是陶玄女代表却對記者表示不必另文規定什麽婦　的權利條文，如照現在就够了，因爲特別規定給婦女的部份是平等的，不規定的，反而不平等了，不特別規定也可以說就是一律平等。</p>

<h3>停戰後北方局勢　平等轅參謀長王鴻韶談　共軍大舉進攻殆不可能</h3>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕北平行轅參謀長王鴻韶，應記者要請，暢談政府宣布停戰令後之北方局勢，氏稱：審度共軍所有力量，今後共軍擾亂則可，大規模之進攻將屬不可能，而在此政府已停戰，國大正在開會時，國軍更無進攻之理，故共產黨宣傳之國軍將攻延安，不過是恐懼病，只要共產黨不擅立政府，國軍絕不會進攻延安，惟共產黨是否將利用國軍停戰時期進攻國軍，則非吾人所知。王氏並稱：國軍現在之要務，爲鞏固旣收復地區治安及確保交通錢，亦即着重綏靖工作。氏繼說明各省現况：（一）山東方面，因經濟及交通條件之優　，共軍將仍有一番活號，但再　載斷　濟路，打　　南走廊，將不可能，其變擊授亂目的，仍在防守，因其無能　寺一據點不退，縱偶有據點被佔，最後仍須退出，大連·烟台間水路聯絡，亦時在我海空軍監視中。（二）河北方面，平漢北段涿·保以西山地，共軍保有相當力量，距交通綫遠則百八十里，近則十餘里，涿縣·石家莊間約有共軍五萬人，現保定南之方順橋，于家莊，我方尙朱完全控制，共軍再圖如上次之大規模破壞，已不可能。（三）山西方面，晋西共軍之連奪數據點，係恐懼陝北之被攻，而岡保持黄河渡口，並增兵陝北，實則該永和·大寗等地無大軍事價値，　軍更不會攻延安。晋北大同，亦不會再有大問題，共軍增兵該方面，亦不出策應陝北。（四）察省方面，大體上無問題，平張鐵路綫可保持，　　在安定地方，察北仍有共軍活動，赤　。龍關匯陷，但無大碍。</p>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕關於共產黨大本營可能由陝北遷移東北之說，記者詢諸東北及北方二權要，渠二人意見相同，認爲在共產黨之陜北被攻恐懼病及東北之經濟地理優越條件下，頗有可能。該東北權　並稱：四平之役前，共產黨即有此準備，但經是役之慘敗，其計劃亦逍中挫。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>華僑經濟的困難</h3>
<p>二十多年來要關而未開的華僑經濟會談，終於前天由僑務委員會與經濟部，在京召開了一個華僑經濟座談會。五個主題，祇在一剎那之間，便把原則通過了，所有的時間，都被華僑放大砲開機關槍消耗了。他們的一字一語，反映出內心的焦急和苦悶，他們的大砲和機關槍說得好聽些，是在「訴苦」，說得難聽些是在「抱怨」。他們個個拍桌大喊，句句是憤慨之言，句句是血淚之語。在情緒緊張之際，言詞間不免心直口快，而動機則甚可貴。</p>
<p>有許多問題國內外是相同的，也有許多問題，單是國外有，而國內無，或國內有，而國外無，僑胞的焦急苦悶，正與國內人民完全相似，他們都像整個泰山重壓着他們的身，懷着黑鉛般沉重的心，焦急得像熱鍋邊上的螞蟻，苦悶得如啞吧吃黄運，華僑經濟是國家經濟的一環，息息相關，我們要求華僑經濟的展開，正是王雲五部長所說的三點，一爲華僑經濟的復員，二爲華僑　國投資，三爲海外推銷市場。</p>
<p>提到華僑經濟復員，問題　生，恰　海外部代表所說僑委會磕頭來的復眾，貨款美金五千萬元，，惹起傲世界注意，但時隔一年，僑胞分文沒有貸到。這種款子又無庸國家貼本，即以當地僑胞在中交兩行存款，僑罷和外國銀行轉款，貸諸於僑胞，還有利息可廉，目前僑胞所得的僅是一個「口惠」。這難　國的僑胞遲遲不能行，緬甸代表　志大講，帶回來的外幣，照政府　率賣給政府，現在要求　單買　一部分外幣，以使返原居留地而不可得，人未動身，安能復員。</p>
<p>僑回國投資，先要保障國內現有僑產，使他們安心，然而事實適相反。荷印代表老同盟革命同志溫菊朋，痛哭流涕地說，他南京四條巷七　房屋被有關係人佔據了，硬是不讓，僑委會派了專員携了公事到處說好話求乞，各方面推來推去，推得一乾二凈，一年來迄未收回，美國代表黄伯耀在廣東調査所得，僑產亦多有被佔情事。擅香山僑領沈靈條講頃自廣東鄕間來，盜賊多如牛毛，白晝横行，貪官滿街走，汚吏多如狗，怎令人不寒而慄，如何鼓得起勇氣來投資祖國。</p>
<p>吃牛奶先要養好牛，而今希望僑胞回祖國投資，僑胞本身已成赤貧，不貧的人亦給居留政府的東縛，資金也周轉不靈，不易流入祖國，前巴城領事林廷澄代表外交部老實說出他所親見的荷印僑胞的痛苦，印尼政府將僑胞手中纍纍的日票，每百元折成印幣二元，調換時必須存銀行，限制每月取百元。荷印政府允許華僑回國，只准帶三百盾，路資瞻養費尙且捉襟見肘，還有什麽錢來投資！越南也是這種情形，華僑回國，每人祗准携越幣二百元抵香港後以市價兌換僅值港幣十餘元，以此搬運行李費猶嫌不足，　論滯留期間食宿各費及歸程旅費。</p>
<p>國內經濟各人均惴惴，担憂大恐慌之將至，營業不振，生產停滯，購買力薄弱，高利貸壓得透不過氣來。若說眞正治本，第一要政治統一，第二爲通貨價値的穩定。但在兵荒馬亂之際，這兩條路都不是一蹴可就的，今日可能範圍內推廣貸物的出路，一爲農村，一爲海外。國內農村，因爲工資高，成本貴，穀價賤，又値戰亂狀態，農村是第一個犧牲者，農民在飢餓綫上掙扎，早失去了購買力，那末唯有海外是當今由國經濟的生命綫。海外國貨最大的市場當然是南洋。華僑在南洋的經濟活動，一爲投資經營，一爲礦廠等勞動，第三稱則爲販賣。他們是南洋土產的「集中販賣」和輸入品「內地的分銷」，前者白種人優爲之且很進步，後者最初則非華僑末由實現，然而戰前數年，輪人品分銷給土人，日人已取僑胞的地位而代之，僑胞已頻危境，今日趕走了日人，正是僑胞的絕好機會，大可把國貨源源販至國外，銷售土人，同時可銷售僑胞自己，其數量自必驚人。</p>
<p>我國出產的茶葉，藥材，海味，雜貨，陶器等，有些居留地一律認爲非必需品，不准外匯，則國貨之在海外，雖不言　，而天然絕跡於市塲。例如口口聲聲對我親善的越南，對於華得外匯的貨物；　國經濟局得以公價港幣折合越幣徴溝，僑咆唯有死路一條。</p>
<p>華僑經濟受了內外的夾攻，真是難關重重。國語有云：「伐木不自其本必復生，塞水不自其源必復流，滅禍不自其　必復亂。」如今救濟之道，只有一句話：請國人澈頭流尾的覺悟，停止內亂！然後外交可以強硬，國內可以安定，華僑經濟也就有了出路。</p>
<h3>攤販問題平議</h3>
<p>昨日本市黃浦警局，突有大批攤販家屬一千餘人列隊包圍，要求　放最近被拘攤販，一時秩序大亂，幸經該分局長接納家屬要求，允將被捕攤販陸續釋放，秩序漸復，詎料結集羣衆續又在老閘警局滋擾，且有搗毀商店情事，形勢頓覺嚴重。目下此事已趨平靜，我們不能不約略有所論列。</p>
<p>首先我們要說的是整飭市容固然是要政，但不能因爲整飭市容，取締攤販，而影響到小民生計，本報對於當前市政設施，曾一再爲文請當局多注意積極性的措施，少來些消極性的取締。攤販之有妨碍交通者固應取締，其未必一定有碍公共交通者，亦不妨從寬，戰後民生凋蔽，應爲人民廣開生路，不應增加失業，以謀社會秩序之安定。其因執行取締攤販命令而遭拘禁者，允應按照法律規定處理，此次攤販願，我們感到人民謀生的不易，多少寄予同情；但如因請願而破壞公共秩序，必將失去一般的同情。在警察當局，取締攤販原係執行命令，職責所在，自不容諉棄，不渦在執行之際，究應愼重，而在羣情激昂的情勢下，允應冷靜應付，方不致釀成巨變。</p>
<p>然而昨日的紛擾，雖因攤販家屬的請願而起，其後却越出了請願的範圍，發生搗毁商店情事，對於這種破壞秩序的行爲是不能得到世人同情的。上海是我國第一都市，如何維持上海的公共秩序，固爲政府職責；但每個市民都有協助維持秩序的責任，不能將這責任完全推到政府身上去。出於昨日的紛擾，我們願每個市民都負起這種責任來；同時，我們要　請政府應該把握時機，多多注意到安定民生。</p>

<h3>聯大政委會激烈舌戰　美闡明對裁軍態度　盼早成立原子能管制協定　各委會加緊工作聯大兩週內可結束</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三十日廣播，美代表康納利昨日在聯大政治與安全委會中發表演說，表示國際管理原子能問題，解決希望已不在遠。康氏聲明僅持管理原子能，不能保證裁軍之實行，世人必須採取有效行動，减少其他軍備。</p>
<p>〔本報紐約特派員三十日專電〕關於裁軍問題，聯介國復遇極大困難，蘇聯已正式通知聯合國，在討論裁軍或管理原子能時，蘇方決不放紫否決權。在另一方面，英美亦已正式向聯合國聲明，堅法反對任何一國持其僅有之一票，破壞對軍縮之國際管理。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿九日電〕蘇聯外次維辛斯基今日在政治委會發言，堅持銷毁原子彈，作爲世界各國普遍裁軍之第一步，同時對於國際管制及監察裁軍之任何決策，堅持保留行使否決權。維辛斯基稱，「原子彈宛如達摩克利茲利刃之繫於一髮，惟有除此威脅，吾人始有安全感。君如無意利用之，何不禁止其製造乎？聯合國機構必須防止普遍裁軍之失敗，必須廢止一切兵器，並須以廢除最危險者始。」美代表即參議員康納利繼起發言，重申美國決不單獨裁軍，並聲明在世界裁軍計劃得以付諸實行，原子彈宣布爲非法以前，蘇聯與其他國間之一切懸題，必須予以解決。康納利聲明美國雖歡迎關於裁軍之任何國際行動，但美國主張在採取此等行動前，必須先成立關於管制及使用原子能之協定。在聯合國機構監督下之集體安全制不獲有效施行以前，裁軍實不能施行。康納利並提出普遍裁軍及保障實施計劃，內載八項辦法，重申美國立塲，但未提及否決權。維辛斯　復率直聲明蘇聯無意放棄否決權，解決裁軍問題時亦然。英首席代表蕭克洛斯以挑　口吻，要求維辛斯基說明對否決權之立塲，據稱，「吾人必須使任何管制不受否決權之妨碍。」維辛斯　答稱，「吾人無意放棄一致的原則（即否決權），現無理由可以改變立塲。軍器與原子彈之管制機關，常列在安理會範圍之內，而須受該會全部表決手續之而制，莫洛托夫外長早已加以說　云。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖三十日電〕聯合國　構決加緊工作，每週常工作七天，並將於夜間照常開會，期使聯大全部工作得於聖誕節前結束。故政治委會及兩託管小組會均定於星期日閉會，而其他委會亦於今日起開始舉行夜間會議。秘書處已決定令各委會於下星期五以前終結討論，使全　大會得於十二月一日起，對各委會之建議案採取最後決議，而於十二月十三日結束此一任務，聞許多歐洲代表業已訂定十二月十四日之艙位，準備返國過聖誕。</p>
<h3>檢討和約賠償條款　四外長會議進展　對德和約將移歐討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三十日廣播：四强外長會議今日獲一重大進展，査義保兩國對南斯拉夫與希臘之賠償，蘇聯以往堅持南國所獲，應倍於希臘，其理由爲南國所受戰爭損失倍於一希臘。但在今日四强外長會議中，莫洛托夫已放業此項堅强主張，對貝爾納斯主張兩國所獲賠償應屬平等一點，表示同意，惟對義保兩國賠償總額尙無協議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦三十日電〕「每日電報」外交訪員稱：列相貝文自美國返此後，英國或將在德國設立駐節公使一職。一俟對德國附　國之和的成立後，對德國本身之和約或將在歐洲討論。</p>
<h3>託管小組會否決　南非合併西南非</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿九日專電〕聯大托管委會之小組會今日否決南華聯邦所提兼餅其委治地西南非之建議，惟同時又決定開放以後　　討論之門戶。後一表決係根據美國與丹麥之共同提案，即本屆大會對西南非併人南非之事，現尙非採取行動之時。美丹建議今日由小組會通渦後，將提交託管委會者慮。</p>
<h3>暹羅自聯合國　撤回對法控訴</h3>

<h3>德境英美區合併　談判下週可完成</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓三十日電〕此間無綫電台宣佈：副國務　艾克遜宣布，關於德境英美佔領區合併之談判，下星期可結束。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕英美關於合併德境兩佔領區之談判完成後，德境英國區之整個行政問題即將施以檢討。英國今已在原則上同意與美國分擔每三年二萬五千萬鎊之兩區經費，惟兩區合併後，將變更美元英鎊貿易之比例，意即以後將向非美元區購買更多之貨物。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎三十日電〕外傳英美政府壓迫法政府，使其贊同德境內三佔領區合併之說，此間負致方面無法加以證實。</p>
<h3>德境佔領區蘇軍　開始大規模撤退　此爲蘇聯政策有重大變更徵象</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿九日電〕此間報紙載柏林來電引述蘇聯參謀人員之談話，謂蘇軍已大規模自德東部撤退。此間英外部發言人稱：此事「十分可能」，並指出史達林於十月廿八日答復合衆社社長之詢問稱，東歐蘇軍六十師將在兩個月以內减至四十師。據傳此次撤退係遵守蘇聯最近頒佈之復員令。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿九日電〕德佔領區蘇軍正在大規模撤退，足見蘇聯政策已有重大改變，俾與美英方針趨於一致。蘇軍撤退消息係由美軍代理總督季亭及德人方面傳出，據季亨稱，蘇軍一部份已開始撤退回國，此與蘇軍當局最近在四國管制會所提供之保證相符合。德官方則稱，蘇聯佔領區即將分爲五邦，每邦各有立法機關與行政機關，此與美英佔領區相同。蘇聯政策原擬將其德境佔領區樹立一中央集權政府，可見其態度已改變。蘇聯此種新政策或可倣照美國務卿主張將德國實行聯邦制，由各邦與四國管制會分掌其統治權。蘇聯撤退之軍隊人數究有若干，尙無確訊。倫敦每日郵報謂，蘇軍此次撤退者約有卅萬人之衆。美軍謀報人員報吿，謂「柏林方面蘇軍並無减少模樣，蘇軍如眞正大規模撤退，則必大吹大擂，以呼聲其在聯大會之裁軍主張」。</p>
<h3>十二月二日定爲　美國「原子節」</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿九日電〕美國決定以十二月二日爲「原子節」，紀念原子炸彈之發明。届時田納西州橡樹　原子彈製造廠，芝加哥製　廠，及新墨西哥州阿拉摩斯原子實騐塲，均將舉行紀念式，按美國原子彈製造計劃，即所謂「麥赫登計劃」，係於十二月四日制定，以後一切原子彈實騐計劃均發源於此。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社貝魯特卅日電〕據「東方日報」載稱：土耳其埃及與伊拉克，定於本年十二月底在報達舉行反共會議，討論抵抗近東及中東共產主義之方法。聞其他阿拉伯族各國代表已被邀參加。</p>
<p>〔路透社報達廿九日電〕伊拉克總理薩伊特今日吿路透社記者稱，有謂本人擬組織大叙利亞者，實屬不確。本人僅知爲自由堅强之阿拉伯世界而努力。本人對於與外的但緊密合作之計劃，亦抱同一態度，薩氏復稱，本人從未代表伊拉克與土簽訂軍事公的，土耳其及伊朗均我鄰國，自應保持善鄰關係。</p>

<p>〔聯合社雅典卅日電〕此間今日報載：希臘北部游擊戰已擴大至土耳其邊境，游擊隊與政府軍發生劇烈衝突甚久，計死九十二人。傳此次衝突係在希土邊境之索非里區，在薩隆尼加東北一百八十哩，離伊斯坦埠僅一百三十哩。</p>
<h3>日本賠償計劃　英國大體贊同　美正與有關各國進行協商</h3>

<p>拘禁攤販釀成軒然大波　全日紛擾交通斷絕十餘人遭槍傷　議員新聞記者在黃浦警局受毆辱　　〔本報訊〕警察局自奉命取締攤販後，黄浦老閘二分局，連日拘捕攤販七百餘人，黄浦分局拘押者約三百餘人，大多均已拘押歡日。昨晨因攤販家屬，紛紛要求送進食物，警局因人數過多，予以拒絕，遂生事故。在羣情情激下，星星之火，乃釀成不可收拾之勢，警察並曾朝天開槍，致流彈受傷者達十餘人。傍晚，羣衆行動漸見越軌，散布傳單，並搗毁沿途各大公司櫥窗，損失極巨。警局至深晚止，已逮捕有煽動嫌疑者百餘人。　　昨晨八時許，黄浦分局內，被拘留三百餘攤販之家屬，紛紛要求送進食物，若干家屬並堅不肯去，必欲將此　攤販釋放。人數旣多，秩序紊亂，該分局則將彼等驅出，並令預備隊出動彈壓，各攤販家屬亦即散去。至午前十一時許，該分局奉命將拘押在內之攤販分批陸續釋放，形熱遂見緩和。不意午後十二時四十五分左右，羣衆忽又　聚，交通阻塞，情形又趨混亂。警局遂再命騎巡隊出動驅散，不意羣衆散而復聚，人數更多，請求釋放尙在拘押之攤販。詎該局警士並不向羣衆作攤販業已全部放出之解釋，而將所有圍觀之羣衆，悉作滋事之徒看待，亂加毆打，新聞記者亦不得免，被毆受傷。於是羣衆愈聚愈多，睹狀益憤通。相持至下午四時，因警察開槍强壓，附近商店，見情形嚴重，相率閉門。時黄浦分局召來救火車三輛，即將龍頭開放，企圖驅散羣衆，法商電車全部停駛，自外灘至八仙橋，首尾銜接不斷。是時情形堅張，成混亂狀態。　　是時市參議會代表王先靑，唐世昌，朱文德三議員，亦已趕到調解，請杜局長發全禁止警察對羣衆採取無禮行動？應盡力勸導，但當時秩序混亂，竟無能爲力，王先靑氏且受警察侮辱。五時許，市長亦至，圳與黄浦分局杜醉分局長會商，並將羣衆中已被該局逮捕者四十餘人，山市長親自訊問後，予以釋放。　　但據黄浦分局方面稱，是時該局對門之長沙商棧樓上，有人開槍，故該局警察，亦即開槍示威，五分鐘後，市長遂偕被困之各報記者離去。其後該局又捕獲行跡可疑者六十餘人。　　沿途搗毀商店　　下午六時，情形益緊，羣衆中似有有組織之行動，一部份羣衆阻止汽車行駛，有二人且倒臥於本報記者車前，阻止行駛者。時羣衆行動更見越軌，竟搗毀沿途公司商店櫥窗廿三處之多。中正東路，北海路，西藏路，浙江路，南京路，福州路等處商店，如紅棉酒家，大新公司，永安公司七重天，新新公司，老閘戲院，金城大戲院，新光大戲院，浙江大戲院，大春樓，履華鞋店，大中央皮鞋店，中央舞廳，廣西路一六四號，二二四號，山西路二一五號，爵祿飯店，國際大戲院，米高美舞廳，國泰越劇塲，新利査西菜社，東方食品公司，大光明眼鏡公司等，皆受破壞，估計損失不下數十億之巨。　　下午七時，警察局副局長兪叔平氏趕到，時槍聲未止，車輛全停。自中正東路至北京路，東西交通全部斷絕。時警察在混亂中亦有被拋洋瓶磚石致傷者。　　老閘分局，所押攤販實較黄浦分局爲多，但因對送入食物之家屬，妥爲維持秩序，各家屬皆得列隊進入，故未生事端。其後因見羣衆搗毁該局轄境內之商店，遂亦出動維持秩序，並曾逮捕行跡可疑者三十餘人，搜出木棍鉛粉筆等物。　　據警局人員稱，紛亂時該局曾派員雜於州人業，密切注意，當時即曾發現有不似攤販者數人，從中指揮，羣衆感情衝動，遂皆隨聲附和，局勢遂益見嚴重。　　鄭家木橋火光　　又五時許槍聲緊密時，若干羣衆，曾奔至鄭家木橋口高生大紙號門口暫避，不意該號樓上忽有沸水下傾，羣衆乃益憤激，即將該號存紙全部拖至馬路，加以焚毁，該號所備之三輪車及自由車各一輛，亦爲彼等焚燒。至晚九時許，沿途雖尙有軍警警戒，秧序已漸恢復，惟高生大紙號前餘燼尙未全熄而已　　彈傷逹十一人　　昨日送往各醫院之因中淸彈而受傷者，有（一）嚴車氏，五十九歲，寗波人，住金陵路一八二號泰安祥錫店，口部足部中彈；（二）李桂林，十七歲，紹興人，住金陵東路二一四號，槍巾下部；（三）鐵蔣氏，二十七歲，住西愛咸斯路二三一弄十一號，足部中彈；（四）葉壽寳，十七歲，住金陵東路三〇二號炳章電料行，傷腰。以上四人，傷勢較重，已施手術，現皆住院。此外巾流彈輕傷者，有（一）王妹妹，三歲；（二）金妹珍，十九歲；（三）嚴達英，十八歲；（四）李阿芳，十一歲；（五）王虞丁，十四歲；（六）姚雲知，二十歲；（七）李富良，二十五歲等七人。潘議長發表談話　認爲當局施政必須愼重　亦望市民共同維持秩序　　市參議會潘議長，對攤販事件發表談話云：本人於昨晚八時曾至黄浦分局調査該事件之眞相，各被捕之攤販，業已全部釋放，並査並無凍死餓死等事件，警局對攤販之設攤問題，亦已有答復，可在公有或私有空地集巾設攤，參議會已將警局之復函，轉予攤販代表，各代表並已表示滿意，正選擇適合之空地，集中經營，如是則各攤販可調已有一出路矣。至對此事件，依余個人看法，認爲現時政府如有新行政設施，而其有關小民生計者，必須愼重考慮，先爲小民生計想一退步辦法，尤其在此冬令，戰後生計艱難，更須愼重處置，免使小民處於飢寒交迫之境地，不但對於攤販如此，譬如人力車夫之取締，亦應逐步施行，蓋今日爲政必須先使人民安居樂業，而後始能使社會秩序趨於安定。氏又稱，地方秘序，全市市民應共同維護，今日之情形，顯有人別有企圖，地方當局有保護人民生命財產之責，相信市府對此事件，必不放棄其責任也云云。警局消防隊以水龍頭驅散羣　（本報　順興攝）程監使進行調查　　程中行監察使於昨日黄浦分局事件發生後，極表關切，當日下午曾赴黄浦分局附近巡視，晚間復赴南京路一帶巡視。聞程氏對此事件，今日將繼續進行調査。黨部明日會議　商討處置辦法　　〔中央社訊〕本市黨部書記長謝仁釗，昨晚爲黄浦分局事件發表談話稱：「關於此次不幸事件，市黨部方面，認爲攤販問題，必須亟謀合理解決。如警局人員對攤販及羣衆，有措置失當之處，亦當査明予以適當處分。至於如有不軌之徒，乘機暴動，擾亂治安，則希望軍警當局，妥爲戒備，以遏亂萌。市黨部定明日召開臨時執委會議，商討處置辦法。」宣局長談話　　〔中央社訊〕警察局宣局長昨晚發表書面談話如下：「本局奉市府命令，自十一月一日起老閘黄浦兩區，所有攤版，除立體不妨碍交通之書報攤販外，其餘一槪取締，本局僅奉命執行，初無與攤販故意爲難之處，惟攤販究爲市民中之少數，如許可任意　設，勢將妨害整個市容，阻滯大多數市民之交通，少數攤阪之利益，固須顧慮，而大多數市民之便利，亦無藐視之理由。此次攤販請願，事前聞有部份歹徒故意製造謠言，竟謂有若十攤販餓斃於黄浦分局，煽惑羣衆包圍黄浦分局集體請願，實際此中潛入歹徒極多，並有少數携帶槍枝，向黄浦分局放槍投石，幸我黄浦分局全體員警，均奉命不准使用槍械，委曲求全，以期不致誤傷無辜市民，擴大事態。而暴徒於請願解散以後，仍任意在黄浦，老閘，新成，泰山，邑廟等分局轄區搗毁商店，戲院，舞廳，且於林森柬路縱火焚燬高生大紙號，此種暴行，實已越出法律範圍以外，妨害全市市民之安寗秩序，本局職司治安，自應依法予以取締，以免擴大，如以後仍有此種不法行爲，必要時將由警備司令部宣佈特別戒嚴，以遏亂萌。此次攤販請願，不意有少數新聞記者，於暴徒投石毆擊警員，情形極度混亂時，稍受處驚，本人至感遺憾」云。攤販派代表請願　參議會調查眞相　　〔本報訊〕本市黄浦及老閘區攤販以違反警局取締設攤，連日被拘於黄浦分局者達三百餘人之多。而攤販以冬令時期，突吿失業，生計難以維持，特於昨日上午派代表包桂枝，周以忠，鄭芝章，顧慰堂等二十餘人，前往市參議會請願，要求顧念攤販生計暫緩取締。市參議會前經攤販請願，曾於本月二十日函請市府考慮。昨日由該會項秘書長昌權接見代表後，當即再電吳市長請予答覆。下午獲警局覆文內稱：「爲顧念攤販生計起見，茲已呈准市府，略予通融，准許各攤販在該兩區內自擇公私空地集中營業，並已分令各該管分局知照矣。」　　昨日下午四時，該代表包桂枝等復偕受傷之攤販季根年赴市參議會聲訴稱，「季根年，住東新橋裕順里十九號，以其父季錫恩被拘黄浦分局內，於昨日下午前往送飯，竟被第九六七九號警士以木棍打傷右額，流血頗多，並打傷左臂，要求主持公道。」市參議會聞報，即推參議員唐世昌，王先靑及朱文德三代表，前往該局調査眞相，並由潘議長電請吳市長同往。平津渝特快電報　今日起繼續開放　　交通部上海電信局，自開放南京·鎭　·無錫·蘇州·杭州·靑島·漢口·廣州·合北·鄞縣等十處特快電報後，以傳遞迅捷正確，民衆稱便，茲自十二月一日起，將繼續開放平·津·渝三處特快電報，收報時間每日自上午八時起至下午六時止，收報處仍在福州路七十號總營業處。宋院長飛抵滬　　行政院院長宋子文氏，已於昨日下午四時由京飛抵滬，秘書參事隨行。宋氏專機降落龍華機塲後，即逕赴寓所休憩。中國中央兩公司　航空客貨運頻繁　　〔本報訊」本市中央，中國兩航空公司，客運貨運均極頻繁。中央航空公司，平均每日載客百餘人離滬，載往重慶之貨物，每日約一噸；昆明之貨物每星期約三噸；西安之貨物每星期約二噸。中國航空公司，平均每日載客三百餘人離滬；載往重慶之貨物，每日的一噸，北平之貨物，每日亦約一噸，昆明之貨物，每星期約二噸。該公司所訂之新機六架，的於下月初抵滬。目前兩公司之營業方針，皆以客運爲主，以貨運爲輔。國營招商局　調整各航輪班次　定期船隻槪不應差　自今日起正式實行　　國營招商局，經一年來之努力，成績頗佳。記者昨據該局胡副經理時淵宣稱：招商局現有船隻，參加客貨航運者計有海字號廿五艘。江字號十五艘，人名號十三艘，連同其他專供差運等船隻之總噸位，已超出六十萬噸之上。爲免除無謂損失，調劑碼頭倉庫之擁擠，以及便利客貨之往來與起卸起見，特將內江與外洋之全部輪航班次，予以決定。凡規定班頭之輪隻，概不應差，自今日起正式實施，一切登記及購票手續，一律照舊辦理。　　北洋綫　　今後行駛北洋綫之船隻，由上海直放天津者，有海甬，海穗，黄興，其美，蔡鍔等五輸，由上海至靑島者，有海滇，海冀，於歸程兼灣連雲港，由青島至天津者，有海漢輪，由靑島至營口者有海津，天津至營口者有海平。　　南洋綫　　行駛南洋綫之船隻，由上海至廣州者有漢民，仲愷，培德三輪。由上海至福州者有海鄂號，由上海經汕頭香港者，有海蘇輪。由上海至汕頭回程兼　厦門者，有海湘輪，（該輪現尙在冲城灣）。由上海經厦門香港至小呂宋者，有海夏輪，（現在港修理，約本月中工竣，即行復航。）國外綫班輪僅此一輪。　　滬台綫　　其他行駛上海至台灣，基隆間者，有海黔，海康二輪，其中雖有不無需要改裝或修理者，招商局亦指定由不定班綫之延　·林森·執信·鄧鏗·自忠·登禹·麟閣等七船隨時補充。或客貨頻繁·致原定輪隻不敷時，亦可由上列七船隨時添航。招商局今後外洋綫之航運已可奠定基礎。　　滬漢綫　　關於內江船隻之支配，亦頗合理想，並於此十三艘江字號內江輪內，擬定七艘專事行駛滬漢綫之正班，滬漢兩埠每逢星期一，三，五對航，又每隔兩星期於星期日加開一班。裝卸貨件　規定標準　　長江綫各埠裝卸貨件，招商局亦有規定，上海以三天計，漢口以二天計，沿途各埠停靠時間，應隨貨物多寡而定，一般應以一小時至四小時爲標準。關於上下水航行時間亦經規定，上水以五日計，下水以四日計。滬漢兩埠總計停留五天，滬漢往返一次，以十四日爲標準？中間各埠計停靠設站者，爲鎭江，南京，蕪湖，安慶，九江等五站，上下水相同。本月三日江寗輪，由滬駛漢，爲實行第一輪，嗣後沿途各埠，無特殊情形，可照預定班期行駛。峨嵋號補給艦　昨晨由青駛滬　　美前贈我之新艦隊，（即太康等八艘）中之補給艦「峨嵋」號，前由美駛華後，即調駛靑島。茲悉：該艦業於昨晨由靑駛抵滬。申盛班輪即開航　　寗紹申盛輪船局，爲便利申盛旅客起見，特開闢申盛班輸船，沿途停靠章練塘’兪家匯，蘆墟，黎里，平望等埠，裝貨搭客均可，即日可開班。台專賣局長過滬赴京　談台省生產建設　糖煤等產量俱已漸復舊觀　　〔本報訊〕台灣省長官公署專賣局局長陳鶴聲博士，昨偕該省酒業公司總經理朱梅及林裕民飛滬。今日晋京接洽要公。陳氏爲留德經濟學家，對台省經濟建設訂有遠大計劃。據其語記者：台灣光復纔一年，一切生產事業，慘淡經營，漸復舊觀，以統計數字而言：（一）糖爲特產，戰前每年最高產量爲一百三十萬噸，現爲四十萬噸，一年後可增加兩倍。（二）煤，戰前最高額月出二十四萬噸，光復時月產一萬五千噸，現出十二萬噸。（三）樟腦，戰前年產四千五百萬噸，

<p>黑白女勝綠隊</p>
<p>黑白佔先繼成平手</p>
<p>六時半，黑白綠隊女子賽開始，黑白以黃如闌，陳玉潤，葉貽情，蕭番冷，及吳玉物出戰，綠隊爲黃明媛，容淑儉，陳環治，王維珍，劉珍寳。蕭番冷先被籃圈，如蘭加上一擲，黑白赫然以四此〇前導，綠隊明媛一罰，玉潤亦獲一分，綠隊呌停，果見顏色一氣連得七分，黑白亟以盧淑惠代出葉貽情，第一節終，綠隊以八比六後來居上。第二節，楊秀枝入巷蕭番冷，十比六後黃如蘭連擲帶罰，連得四分，容淑儉亦建一功，玉潤投入，前半完畢。各十二秋色平分。</p>

<p>電影與戲劇</p>
<h3>看「草莽英雄」</h3>
<p>— 丁芝</p>
<p>我覺得以人力物力，加上編劇與導演，在過去使我看得滿意的是「文天祥」，在目前是「草莽英雄」。</p>
<p>編劇，取材之得體以及闡明之主題，是無瑕可說。</p>
<p>導演，可以說是簡潔，明朗，每一塲的動作，頗像銀幕上的電影鏡頭，看來有一種「美」的感覺，尤其是幾個羣衆塲面，旣不堆在一起，也不亂糟糟，却是很有秩序地排列着，組成美麗而雄壯的畫面，我想導演如果不是洪先生，演員一定不會這麽聽話。</p>
<p>佈景頗能特創一格，燈光也能通力合作，這樣更幫助了演出的效果。</p>
<p>演負以葉高，夏天，王蘋，馮　，藍馬，軍偉，高洋，石景山，沈揚，陳靜等來分飾劇中各要角。演出之緊凑增加了人們不少興趣，——我決不是偶像主義的崇拜者，但是一個好的劇本，必需要有經騐的演員才會把劇本襯托得轟轟烈烈。</p>
<p>更可貫的是所謂裏面幾個跑龍套演員，有的說一兩句話，有的是不說話的，他們都能守着本位，幫着增加演出效果，毫不吊而郞當，也不吃荳腐，一本正經她做着戲，可以說：我自看話劇以來還是第一次，如果每次演出，都能有這樣的合作精神，話劇是不難蓬勃起來。</p>
<p>演員裏面我特別喜歡王蘋，她在戲裏頭是飾大嫂是她丈夫的好幫手，是一位精明能幹的主婦，——從各登塲人物對白裏介紹出大嫂的輪廓是如此，後來給王蘋演來更是活龍活現。坐在我後面的一位觀衆，竟脫口而呼「眞太好了。」當然他也是指着王蘋的演技說的。可惜我與王蘋小姐不熟，不知道王小姐私底下的個性是否也有這樣的，如果不是而能把劇中人的性格刻劃得這麼淸楚，把握得這麼穩，的確是使人欽佩的。戲演得好，自有人來欣賞，眞用不着拿什麽「名旦」來標榜。</p>
<p>其次是夏天，他扮演的是一個反派角色，奸細坯子，本來演道一型的角色，扮演者往往喜歡强調他的劣點，使人看了覺得「過火」，夏天演來恰到好處，這是不容易的。</p>
<p>藍馬，他的戲演來始終是篤篤定定的，的確有許多有身份的劇中人，是需要藍馬來飾演，才能襯托出劇中人的地位是佔多麼重要。有人曾經問我，「石揮好？還是藍馬好」？我說：各有各的戲路，兩個都好」，今晚看了藍馬在台上的風度，使我想起了一個比喩，我覺得石揮像京劇演員麒麟童，藍馬却像蓋呌天。尤其今晚他那副派頭，頗像蓋呌天之唱「大明府」裏的盧俊義。而且他的臉部化裝，在我看來，幾可亂眞。</p>
<p>沈揚口齒淸爽，聲音響亮，是他的好本錢。我看了他幾次戲，扮演着不同的角色，而能給人不同的印象。眞是個可愛的演員。</p>
<p>韋偉，比已往演的幾個戲都好，我想：一定是這次三妹的性格，她喜歡了，或者是附合了。</p>
<p>其他各位都很努力，都很盡責。看了眞使人滿意。</p>
<p>末了的結尾，我好像有個感覺，好似缺了什麼似地，而且大哥的衝出去，好像故意給餵槍彈。同樣地五哥出去就沒事了，似乎大哥的死，勉强了一點。</p>
<p>憑心而論，這次「草莽英雄」是一件眞的藝術作品，也可以說是「話劇的代表」。</p>
<p>其次，換景的時間，如果還能趕着一點兒，我相信一定可以把失去的觀衆，重新找回來。</p>
<p>還有在第二幕第二塲裏面，各路英雄的扮演者，是由市立實騐劇校的學生担任，看了之後，令人感嘆，他們都是一羣戲劇的愛好者，如今學校撤銷，頗像一　無依的孤兒，不知校方可會爲他們想法？否則，各敎授也該給他們介紹一條繼續學習戲劇的門路。</p>
<h3>「孟姜女」　改編的歌劇</h3>
<p>— 宋靑灣</p>
<p>中華音樂劇團（Chinese　Dance　Drama　Co．）的歌劇「孟養女」，此次來南京演出，音樂戲劇界的朋友當然不能錯過這種機會，雖然票賣的那麽高，也不能不忍痛犧牲一下。而獲得的結果是失望。</p>
<p>歌劇在中國沒有一個顯明路綫的時候，誰也不能肯定說山國的歌劇應該怎樣着手。「孟姜女」裏面的中國舊劇演員，配上西洋的Orchestra。用中國　劇的台步，又加上西洋現代化的舞蹈。穿中國的古裝，又襯善印象派的佈景……像這種巾西混亂不倫不類的演出，連最起碼的「統一」也沒有做到。</p>
<p>該劇的領導人兼作曲是一位俄國老人阿弗憂洛穆夫（Avshalomoff）。譜曲上除了畏笛（fite）奏出十二月孟姜女小調還有點東方味道外，其他可以說都是西洋的交響樂。阿氏對中國的歌劇理想倒說的很對，他說：「中國的音樂戲劇比西洋的藝術更爲豐富，尤其民間藝術更充滿奔放的感情把文弄成歌劇是很理想的」而阿氏在表現上確相反，在該劇裏我們並沒有看到能代表中國歌劇的特色。</p>
<p>阿氏對樂劇首創者瓦格納（Wagner）硏究頗具心得。他想用中國的藥材以自己的想像和技巧來搆成中國風的藝術品。中國舊型的戲劇種類頗多，不但是阿氏，就是中國人自己都難以弄得淸楚。此次南京的演出，較內行的朋友們都不太同意。</p>
<p>一個外國朋友爲中國歌劇下這種工夫實可欽佩。我們所希望是能够更澈底研究一下，因爲「孟姜女」一劇是要代表中國的歌劇而出國，也可以說把中國的藝術介紹出國。如果中國歌劇就是這樣，恐有問題。</p>
<h3>「蘆花翻白燕子飛」之一鏡頭</h3>
<h3>關於陳白塵</h3>
<p>— 周思寫於蘇州</p>
<p>以前本刊上，納雅先生舉出了四位我國的劇作家，分別加以介紹與檢討，道對於愛好戲劇的讀者、是一個良好的參考。但其中關於曹禺與陳白塵的，我以爲不妨加一次再檢討。</p>
<p>曹禺初期的作品中，確有着人物被命運所支配的一點，尤以雷雨最多；但說是「宿命論」，却還未必。</p>
<p>陳白塵是喜劇的能手，「陞官圖」更是針對着現實。作者曾說過；他寫「陞官圖」是爲了作一個考騐。我們也決不能否認現社會中沒有這一羣人的影十。納雅先生說：「陞官圖中的官老爺似嫌太過火一點，官說什麼是什麽，他忘記了百姓的權利。」是的，把眞實的人加以漫畫化，而表現成一個喜劇中的人物時，不免帶有一些過火的誇張。然而，也正因爲這誇張，才使我們更淸楚地認識了這些人。還有新官上任中的一羣，凡是在淪陷區生活的人民，是更可以知道他們的眞實性了。</p>
<p>還有一點，就是鳳凰城的編者是吳祖光，並不是袁俊。</p>
<h3>「復活」</h3>
<p>— 唐軻</p>
<p>近來「　　　　」　把　　文　托　斯太的「復活」，搬上越劇舞台，這不能說不是越劇界的光榮。</p>
<p>「復活」改編成舞台劇，　內已由話劇界先輩田漢和夏衍先後改編，田漢改作題旨是着　土地問題，　衍却是表現男主人公南赫留　甫，對女主人公　邱莎犯罪後的　　的心理過　，並　以反映當時　　社會貴族的荒淫無恥。他們改編的意關雖各不同，而崇拜托　的人道主義却沒有互異。</p>
<p>筆者並未知道他們改編的　點在何處？如果僅是看中了它的故事結構之曲折　奇，或是拮取南赫留　甫與略邱莎的柔情和愁慘的羅曼史，才着手改編的話，那不但不能傳逹托翁的精神，並且還忽視了原作的深沉的教育意義。這　的揣測是我看了「鳳　相思」中才子佳人的悲歡離合的故事才有的。因此，當「復活」改編成越劇的時候，十萬不能偏向南赫留道　與　邱莎的「曖昧」關係，該　重地尊重托翁的原作精神。</p>
<p>旣已確定了主題的　正性，也就不能把　國情調的作品，改編成中國作廢。事實上，中國終究是中國，我國也依然是俄國，絕不能在俄國的生活里，滲予了中國的風尙。否則，我們將會在越劇舞台上看到：有中國人的思想和感情的俄國人了。</p>
<p>希望這個被人們　譽的越劇團，能在這次的改編中跳出舊的巢血，站在新的眞正的藝術立塲！</p>
<p>一九四六年十月之良辰，舉行於法織南方地中海岸坎市Connes之國際電影演　，氣吞萬　，名重一時，計前後兩來復間，有十四國語文之一百五十五部電影，次第展演。言其種類，大別爲三，第一種綴合情節而成。如編戲，即習見之影戲，又可名爲戲劇映畫。第二種攝取實景，加以藝術化，稱「文化電影」，又名「影檔」。第三種爲細工描繪之諧　，可稱作「活動滑　　」。照例每　預賽之出品，至少須備影戲影擋各一部。其第三項出品爲隨意科，今仍由首先發明此製之美國人Walt　Disnay獨擅其長，演賽結果，國際大獎祇一門，國家獎二十四門，其出品之榮膺國際大獎者，第一名屬法國，乃戰爭影檔，題爲後方遊擊戰。第二名屬俄國，乃彩色照相之運動Sport科影檔，中有二萬五千男女靑年，大會於莫斯可市中心之紅塲，隱示國力之强，實對外宣傳妙構，題爲我國靑年。次則每國</p>
<h3>法國坎市　電影比賽</h3>
<p>— 宏負</p>
<p>最佳出品均有得獎機會之國家獎，其能代表一國血佔優勝者。美國獎爲「無謂之週末」。法國獎爲「鄕景美之合奏」，義國獎影檔傑作，爲「不設防之羅馬」。荷國獎爲記述一九四四及四五年實事之饑荒。俄國獎曰「急轉疾下」。丹麥獎曰「血地」。英國獎曰「短晷之遭際」。印度獎爲描寫工人區域之「下城」。他如捷克墨西哥瑞典瑞士諸作，佳者均有獎。中惟瑞士已得國家獎之最後機會」。一部影檻因致力倡導和平，同時兼受國際和平獎。綜觀給獎標準，似仍側重愛國行動與戰爭，此則出自評判員之鑒裁，而於一般觀衆之意微有異，觀衆對於戰爭險象以及戰時愛國靑年暗中抵抗等舊文，均示厭倦。識者若更進一層，注意羣衆心理之測騐，則自始至終，可稱成績最佳之預賽出品，莫如美國滑稽藝人，愷懌所表演之「奇人」，因此作引致全塲哄笑，竟逾五十分鐘，惜乎未曾獲獎，徒悲滄海遺珠，天下事不凑巧者甚多，一切可作如是觀也。</p>
<h3>新片漫談</h3>
<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>聖誕節</p>
<p>火樹銀花堆砌的節日，歡樂襄難免藏有悲哀的舊夢，生命裏的一個鴻爪。莫罕把他這種意思寫成「聖誕節」，一個倫敦客玩厭了紙牌，到巴黎找刺激，某一妓女的一番凄慘的申述，這人興緻全消，悄然回到他的紙牌桌上去安份守己了。電影改編與原著頗有出入，少尉一角是爲了國情需要臨時增加，乃成蛇足，失却原著的人生意味。導演羅勃史奧麥克似係法國人，作品中「殺妻報」「兄妹之間」俱見卓特，本片處理在繁文瑣節方面，細膩明說，尤其是緊張局面的安排，奇巧簡潔。吿訴我們他確是一個神秘片的一流導演。但是因爲如此，對於這一個改壞了的脚木，他未曾了解其中意旨，也就無法表達這個悲劇的功力、開頭結尾很覺庸俗，結尾鏡頭，我覺得可以利用狄安娜竇萍的眼睛，把鏡頭一直朝前往女主角的眼睛推進，一個大特寫，讓眼睛變成一片黑色大海，茫茫然，一滴白色搖晃的淚珠，琉下來，放大了，上面現出一個END字，象徵了這個女人吞聲忍淚的一生，對於這張淺顯的片子或許不無小補。</p>
<p>情海血淚</p>
<p>恢復原始式的戀愛，是城市人最大的希望，深海裸浴，山洞鴛居，赤裸裸的快樂的人生，「怒火情燄」裏的男主人公因此重返南海的懷抱裏去，「情海血淚」的李却却離開西班牙吉卜賽的浪漫，重返英倫的文明世界，讓那個熱情的吉卜賽舞姬以身殉情，讓一對靑梅竹馬的情侶歷盡滄桑重拾舊歡，這便是英國人的民族優秀感，倫敦客浪漫的幻想。「情海血淚」是一齣絕頂羅曼蒂克的Melocrama，熱戀，嫉忌，陰謀，陷阱，謀害，命運，重逢，殉情，死門……恰是Melodrama的全部原素，此片又是典型英國風，悠長曲折，味道很足。導演手法擴悍有力，流沙葬身，妖姬濫舞，印象深刻。男主角史都格萊傑文武雙全，女主角琪恩凱德色藝雖在好萊塢亦屬不是凡品。安妮克勞馥氣派果然華貴，但我總是偏愛吉卜賽的熱　美。</p>
<p>郎才女貌</p>
<p>文學家不要夢想，這樣的故事只是銀幕上的題材，弄假成眞，倒底是一塲戲，情節不落俗套的喜劇，即使引用一此舊　頭，一樣可以哄堂。「瘋在世家」「迷魂　過」「蘇珊　史」「職業天人」「紅塵三客」「女皇獵　」以後，「男女之間」「金絲雀」和這張「郞才女貌」是我最滿意的喜　，從字幕開始到敎授們帶上門結束，眞是笑話百出，七個老糊塗加上一個戇頭戇腦的靑年語言學者，學習土語，亂認外父，臨時習拳，還要一本正經，若有其事，書傻子談戀愛難得不呌人捧腹。導演霍華何，調度流暢非常，各個幽默塲合的樞紐也有很好的連繫。賣萊古柏和白蓓蘭史丹妃愈老愈妙，賈萊的魯男子風格早成一派，白蓓蘭從來渾身是戲，她的解衣脫機揮動大腿一節，令人眩目，難怪那個老女僕說她是那種破壞一切文明的女人。可惜這番所穿衣服不能襯出她的身段，所幸她的前劉海捲上去以後，望之仍如荳寇年華，說得上女貌如花。</p>
<p>合家歡</p>
<p>回頭看，是四十年前的好日子，存在於彩色繽紛的賀年卡片裏的Good　old　days，重現眼前，一片陽光，一片雪花，一片落葉，初戀的細語，靑春的舞會，悠揚的爲車鈴，幽靜的星月夜，都是多麼可親。我眞歡喜那密蘇里州聖路易城的家庭，一出嘹亮的琴聲和婉轉的歌唱，滿屋子的男女老幼，親親熱熱，一團和氣，各人有一段永遠閃爍的橙色的歲月，像我自己過去生活中的發光的時間。不歡喜普通歌舞片的庸俗歌舞，我却喜愛「合家歡」，可愛的演員的嘩然笑聲，和簡易誠懇的歌舞：「在聖路易遇見我」，「我愛上隔鄰的男孩」，「我與你永遠生活在一起」，電車裏的花團錦簇就是一個成人的童話世界，會散後的熄了燈的客應，叫我想再看一次「合家歡」，尋找一個朦朧了的昔日，　一個溫馨的生命。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>情緒</h3>
<p>— 璟珊</p>
<p>保加利亞的名作家伊凡伐佐夫（Lvanvazov）曾寫過一篇關于一座小劇塲的短篇小說，情節非常簡單，大意是說在滿城戲院十都天天客滿的常兒，却有一座小劇塲都沒一人去光臨；因爲觀衆實在太少，所以不得不停演而退錢給僅有的幾個觀衆。這巳是第×晚，塲主忙碌地佈置一切，預備開演了，可是到了時候，座上却只有稀疏的四五個看客，於是一分鐘，一刻鐘一點鐘地挨下去，新來的看客是絕無僅有，而座上的人都漸漸地變得沒精打彩。最後，終於幕開了，但出來的是塲主，他憂鬱地宜佈道一晚的表演只得也取消了，請大家到門口去退票。</p>
<p>故事是簡單的，作者亦不曾用什麽出奇的技巧，但是，這篇小說却給予我很深的印象，唯一的理由，我覺得是那篇小說中所含的情緒太感人了。</p>
<p>本來藝術的本質就是人類情緒的聯繫，情緒是一種基力（借用佛洛伊特的名詞），這基力不可抑制地想找發洩的方法，藝術的造成就是其中一種。</p>
<p>譬如說：民間的山歌，有許多是情緒成熟的作品，比起某些忸忸揑揑的新詩或散文來，前者的感人程度是勝過於後者的。又譬如一篇情緒成熟的「平凡小說」，其感人的程度也可以勝過一部情節離奇曲折，寫作技巧新奇的作品。因爲，一篇沒有摻入作者情緒的虛構的作品，猶如一個沒有靈魂的軀殼，如此，怎能引起讀者的共鳴？與藝術的本質也根本背道而馳了。</p>
<p>所以對一部偉大的作品，除了內客和技巧之外，更不可少的是情緒，否則祗能稱爲「故事匠」的故事，或是宜傳者的宣傳文字。</p>
<p>但是我們試着目前的文藝作品，單就小說一項來說，　是相當的多，尤其是刊載文藝作品的期刊，似乎是不登一兩篇小說就像不能成爲完璧一樣。但他們的內容呢？十之八九祗是一個徒軀殼的故事，這眞是何苦來呢？所可惜的是那些「非習作者」所寫的。因爲他們在踏入「非習作者」的階段之前，除了技巧的熟練外，一定還得有過很好的情緒的養育，而現在却只注重在技巧的發展上，這不是很可惜的嗎？</p>
<p>讓我們再重覆一遍：「藝術的本質就是人類，情緒的聯繫」。違反這本質的，祗能供某些人們的消遣或享樂，而決不能稱之爲完整的藝術的。</p>
<h3>求其友聲　關於文藝茶話會</h3>
<p>（一）宗魯</p>
<p>像文藝茶話會這樣的一種集會，在我個人一到上海以後就感到非常需要。這聲色犬馬的大都市却很少有我們這般寒酸的文化人的好去處。而且八年烽火，舊侶星散，即目前同在上海一地的朋友，也很難得有叙譚的機會，經濟上的窘絀，使友誼聯絡更受到影響。所以這樣一種集會，也可以說是適合一般的要求，如與會者都能抱純眞的熱情建立新的友誼日後的擴展當可預卜。</p>
<p>茶話性質固然可以祗止於公餘消閑，聯絡情感這兩個題目。但也不妨稍稍注意到一點文藝上的座談，藉以提倡風氣，互相砥礪。譬如今天我們大都看了齊白石的畫展來的不妨就齊氏的藝術各抒觀感及批評，或就「春秋」「文潮」等刊物上的作品來作一番創作上諸問題的研討。這樣不僅使年靑的參加者有豐饒滿意的收檴，即在茶話會本身，也充滿着無限生氣。評述的立塲和觀點完全自由，不立宗派，大家本忠於藝術之初衷，共同爭取進一步，庶幾文藝茶話，不落「有閑」之譏，而有真實的內容。其次，參加者也可以提出文藝上任何問題請求某一位作家發表意見和答覆</p>
<p>（二）俞劍華</p>
<p>星期日下午第一次到大新公司五層棋酒家參加第四次文藝茶話會，現在有點小小的的意見，提出來供會友參考：</p>
<p>（一）會所那天有四五家在五層樓酒家結婚，賓客雜沓音樂齋鳴，聲音之　鬧，實屬無以復加。我想文藝茶話，應該找一個比較淸靜幽雅的地方，品茗淸談，細訴衷曲，不特名實相符，並且可使終日奔波勞碌的人得半日休閑，暫只把國家大事，社會不安，經濟壓迫，家庭瑣事，置之度外，海闊天空的，發發妙論，使緊張過度的神經，藉此鬆弛一下，豈不甚好？但是現在這個會所太熱閙，只佩尋找　　，紙醉金迷的先生們迫　取樂，實在不佩我們這批酸溜溜的窮措大坐在那兒談天說地，爲此我正式向伸年華林進　諸先生提議，請您們發發慈悲，換一個地方。</p>
<p>（二）簽名我想應該買一本厚一點的十行簿（裱好的册頁允佳）侮决按决序簽下去，第一次到會的，必須汪明通訊處及職業，以便以後通訊，前四次的簽名均可貼在前面，這樣每次人數的多少，也很容易計算，時間久了，說不定對於文藝界的掌故，還會有些川處，不知諸公以爲如何？</p>
<p>（三）丁亦</p>
<p>文藝茶話會，迄本月廿四日止，已舉行了五次，第一，四，五次，我都參加，第二，三兩次，因不在上海，朱能躬逢其盛。</p>
<p>這會的目的，在第一次會裏，華林先生說過，只是談「友誼」，談「朋友之愛」。是的，人生難道不需要「愛」嗎？難道「愛」的領域，只限於兩性間及家庭間就够了嗎？朋友間是否需要「愛」？人類智識發展到今天，我不相信有人能找出理由來吾定作答！</p>
<p>文藝茶話會的作用，只在茶話「文藝」，文藝以愛爲內容，有愛才有美，有愛才有活力。所以這裏也是人間愛苗的培育塲所之一，你若不信，試請坐在這房間的角落裏，放眼室內，但見有年高，有年少，有氣度磅礴，也有丰度翩翩，或是三五聚談，或則二人對語，只看到誠樸謙讓的表情，找不出矜誇傲慢的態度，這是何等諧和的塲面！也是一幅美妙的圖畫！我會後歸來。留得如是印象。</p>
<p>若能在每一次的會裏，請一位與會的老前輩作自由講談，長短不拘，內容隨便，或是寫作經騐，或是日常觀察（專題與漫談均佳，蒼蠅或宇宙也好），任他興到神來，發爲不　之論。使與會的靑年（我也在內），得多了解一點藝術之所以爲藝術處，也是一件極有意義的事，這是我的希望，也是我的提議。</p>
<p>（四）徐仲年</p>
<p>華林進珊兩兄交來三封信，呌我總覆一下。在此以前，我也讀到了靑陽先生的信，並且在另一報上公開答覆了。我對於諸位的關切「文藝茶話會」，以發起人的立塲，非常感激！這個茶話會原是「大家」的，正該「大家」愛護它，「大家」設法改進它。我和華林。春苔。承蔭。進珊。亞塵等，不過多跑一些腿而已</p>
<p>在第五次茶話會上，我和華林·涵秋·劍華諸兄談起：我不懂是我們老了，抑是社會老了？以前的「文藝茶話會」並無多大準備，然而每决舉行，大家「自動」講話，「自動」演奏，「自動」拿作品出來請敎：總之，比現在天眞得多！旣然現今「天眞」減少，——不問是年齡或社會環境使它這樣，——何妨加重不含功利色彩的「人爲」，就是所謂「準備」。然而，提起了準備，有兩點需要大家注意：（一）「大家」努力準備，避免側重少數人；（二）窮忙。窮忙。窮則忙，現今大家比從前忙，因此準備的進行必然比從前遲緩而多困難。</p>
<p>第五次茶話會的地點雖則仍在五層樓酒家，但換了第一號　。劍華先生參加了，很滿意，說：『這兒很靜，可以談天了！』簽名簿本來不用數頁：所以對於劍華先生提出來的兩點，可稱　滿答覆。至於宗魯先生提出的積極性的談話和亦　先生指示的朋友之愛：正所謂「英雄所見略同」，祗須在「和睦」與「單純」　重條件下，我們大家來努力！</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　109</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這一次的舞，當然極其酣暢，因爲兩人面容上，都含着勝利的微笑。究竟誰是勝利者呢？大概兩個人都自認爲自己勝利了。這一次的舞，似乎結束了鶴見道一天的冗忙，也似乎結束了他和萍子的一段奇遇，如果眞是奇遇的話。舞畢下來，已經兩句鐘了，舞廳的各色人等，早已紛紛散塲，鶴見和萍子也預備回家，却又彼此爭論着，要用自己的車子，送對方先到寓所。鶴摻挽着萍子川了舞廳，二人走到衣帽寄存櫃上，鶴見取了帽子，萍子取了披肩，依舊做照西洋禮節，半挽半摻，相將出了三重大門。這時，二人誰也沒有留心，兩旁及身後，忽然擁出四個西洋彪形大漢，用武器罩住了兩人。其中一個，也穿着晚禮服，胸口邊吊着一隻單眼鏡，好　歐洲貴族氣派，用生硬的發音，說着很圓熟的日本語句：</p>
<p>「失禮得很，因爲公事上的關係，請二位移步，到敝上司那裏，談幾句話……只要二位沒有意外的動作，鄙人決不敢動粗」！</p>
<p>「閣下的貴上司是誰」？鶴見的態度，異常沉着。問這話的時候，同時描射了這包圍的幾個人一眼，連身邊的萍子的神悄，也在注意之中。萍子却是低下了頭，回復了日本女子傳統的羞澀態度。</p>
<p>「到了地方，閣下自然明白，說也無益」。單眼鏡的紳士，答應得如此乾脆，「請漂亮些上車罷」！</p>
<p>「敝國是有法度的，請閣下徹底思想一下，這種舉動是不是合法」！鶴見抗拒着。</p>
<p>「鄙人代表的，正是貴國最嚴緊的法度」。</p>
<p>「鶴見先生」萍子顰着黛眉，　了鶴見一眼，復又低下了頭，「只能去一下，他們的上司是你知道的人」。</p>
<p>鶴見四面看了一看，別說自己的車子，連野猪的影子也不見了。〇十二號和他手下的人，也看不見一個。看看情形，把那半邊眼鏡紳士和萍子的話，凑在一齊，想了一想，知道這是一個特殊情形，抵抗無益，只能漂漂亮亮地上了那紳士預備的汽車。萍子也隨着進了車廂，和鶴見坐在一起，那紳士却坐在萍子身邊。</p>
<p>這部車子，剛要開動的當口，只見迎面風馳電掣的來了一部華麗的車子，倒了舞廳門口，猛然煞住，攔住了這部車子的去路，車子一停，上面跳下了兩個軍官打扮的中年，後面跟着一個和服的老年，另外還有兩個，好像是隨員衛隊之類的人。這一羣人下來，都對着舞團大門，昂起頭來，似乎要辨識地點對與不對似的。</p>
<p>「井上老伯」萍子在車廂裏面喊着，「舞應裏沒有音樂了」「音樂」兩字顯見是個隱語。</p>

<h3>寒流</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>西伯利亞寒流向中國本部侵製，長江一帶溫度突降至零度左右，據本報專電稱：南京·鎭江·無錫·蘇州·杭州·漢口等地都大靈紛飛，立成一片銀白世界，上海雖然沒有落雪，但這兩天確實冷得可以。</p>
<p>氣候一冷，禦寒用品都乘機漲起價來了，比如烟煤，開平二號層每噸已達三十四五萬元，煤球黑市每噸亦達二十四五萬元，今年這個冬季，照此情形，大家不免要縮手縮脚地在苦捱了。</p>
<p>住在房子裏，衣服穿得暖，三餐喫得飽，儘管冷，還不致到性命交關的程度，想想那些在街頭流浪，衣食無着的人，那是怎麽樣的一種慘狀呀！在他們，一分一秒都在生死綫上掙扎，而這些人，遠一點地方，蘇北·皖北·河南·山東·東北……成千成萬，我們也許不能親目睹及，然而在我們周圍，上海市區內各處所散佈的這些受難的人，我們能熟視無睹嗎？</p>
<p>過去，中國樂善好施的富人們，往往隨季候之變異而施茶施粥，施衣施藥，甚至施材，不論它的影響大小，也不論其動機如何，至少它是保留了人類的一份同情心，示人爲善，這種出自民間自動的社會救濟工作，消極方面對建立社會道德的貢獻，又何嘗在救濟工作本身之一下呢？</p>
<p>天寒地沍，請大家給那些餐風飲露者一點溫曖罷！</p>

<h3>原子炸彈　險被納粹利用　3</h3>
<p>— 藍寗譯自十一有份「讀者文摘」</p>
<p>會晤以後，事情進行就神速了，現在他們一共有十一個挪威人了，躱在「燕雀」藏匿所在，密密商議。愛諾供給有關警衛地點，換崗時間等等最新的情報。進攻者將循若干哩峻峭崎嶇白雪覆道的山路下去，爬下一個千呎深谷，渡過條奔騰的山澗，然後再上爬一千呎山壁，便到達通往工廠去的鐵路圍牆。祇要有一絲警訊，這整個區域便會向動地照一遍探照燈。</p>
<p>險極</p>
<p>二月廿七日晨八時，九個人出發。身負敏銳爆炸物，跋涉深谷絕壁，正是無比的艱苦。融冰充塞浮沉在湍急的溪流中。幸而最後他們終於找到了一小座冰橋，得以安波。接着又開始爬登　岩。小隊的領袖龍尼不　看着手錶，容許躭擱的時間是不多的。如此，他們一寸一寸地爬上這一千呎高的削壁去。道些挪成人知道，一失足便什麽都完了。</p>
<p>最後到了頂巓，用着最大的努力、循着鐵道圍牆，向前爬行。現在離工廠只五百呎了。他們已能聽到機器的隆隆聲。龍尼跟諸人作了决最後的悄悄商議，藉以確知衆人是否都明白各個的工作。「是時候了，」他最後說。拿　鋒利的鋼剪的一個首先過去。於是傳來低低的鋼鎖斷裂的聲昔。其餘的人立即敏捷地跟着魚貫挨過了鐵鬥。五個執湯姆槍的，沉靜地圍着十二個　軍居住的營房佈好陣地。假若有警報，當德軍一出來的時候，便要被射死。</p>
<p>感謝特朗斯達博士精密的訓練，龍尼所率領的四個破壞隊，幾分鐘內便穿越過曲折迷離的孔道，找到了高壓室。</p>
<p>那裏的衛兵，突然看見黑黜　的天花板壁洞裏，伸出了兩枝槍，駭了他一下。他也就只得乖乖的聽話了。龍尼熟練地將機器與存儲重水的水槽繞在一起，繫上炸　——是他在英國時已訓練有素的事情了，因此知道那些是最容易損害的東西。這時另外幾個隊員也已佈置就緒，到了此處。</p>
<p>報到這時還未哀鳴。龍尼燃上卅秒鐘的導火錢，便回頭呌那衛兵（他是挪威人）逃命。他們這一羣逃出屋子二十碼時，便聽得崩天裂地的轟炸聲。</p>
<p>警報</p>
<p>等警報　　天際，睡眼朦朧的德國兵提槍趕出來，龍尼他們早已循着艱險　峭，而德軍看來是不能飛渡的來路回去了。這時候，水槽炸破了，一千磅無價的重水流入了陰溝。</p>
<p>幾個小時不到，德軍司令法肯霍將軍趕到了佛莫克。巡視了一番。他宣稱：「這是我所曾見最厲害的破壞。」他發出命令，在該區調集了整　德軍，大的有一萬二千人以上。滑雪巡邏隊與緩緩飛翔的偵察機搜尋山嶺。所有道路與山道全被封鎖，納粹和衝鋒隊員則按戶搜査居民。但是這些襲擊者毫無蹤跡。</p>
<p>「射擊手」隊員中的五個業已迅速地滑雪越過瑞典界綫，平安飛返倫敦。那第六個，龐查，跟四個「燕雀」隊員留着處理其他的地下工作。他們踏着雪橇跟法肯霍的巡邏隊玩着捉迷藏的把戲。</p>
<p>愛諾退回他的　的小屋中，發電報吿爆炸的結果，一面繼續注視着諾斯克哈德羅。</p>
<p>功成</p>
<p>一九四三年冬，愛諾電吿，破壞的業已修復，那工廠又恢復生產了。美國第八空軍的轟炸機隊立刻把工廠的發電站炸毁。於是德人決定將諾斯克哈德羅所有製造重水的設備與已製成的重水，移往德國一個地下的廠址去。這些物資預定在某日裝在貨車上，由鐵路渡輪「水力」號載着駛過汀絲裘湖。愛諾要求總部允許他炸沉「水力」號。允諾急速地到來，愛諾即授命龐査到來。其時龐查在五十哩外挪威地下團體中。他藉僞造證件冒充諾斯克哈德羅的職員，混上船佈置了一臀。剛在船開駛前不久，給放進了一顆定時炸彈。</p>
<p>幾天以後德國最後一批重水已沉入汀絲麥湖的底裏。希特勒製造原子炸彈的計劃，就此延滯下來，至於靜止。他們不得不轉向於其他新武器的製造。但是我們——盟國的人民，對這十一個勇敢的挪威人永遠懷着不盡的感激。（完）</p>

<h3>叫化子的組織　3</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>每一桶子之中，由一個「爺叔」輩坐鎭，另外收容小鬼輩自五六人至十餘人不等。人數太多了勢將無以自容，太少時又勢力單薄，不足以抵抗外侮。爺叔已佔有桶子，食宿問題才吿解決。於是便開展發展其勢力，努力於「扒錢」。先在該桶子的周圍地段用足心思，第一步便向商店老闆和攤販打拱作揖，大陪笑臉。意思是說。「奴才是新派來宰理本地段的，一切請大老闆多多照應。」於是每逢年節，喜慶吉日以至喪事日，爺叔便可以向店家討賞錢了。第二步便是着手調査轄境內各個住家的「戶口」，其實目的不在戶口，而在股實或是貧　。作何經紀，有無秘密的勾當，或是與誰家有何仇怨等等。因爲此輩唯恐天下不亂。他們最希望人家發生口角或衝突、他們便可以參加其間而得到利潤。第三步是　査境內多少店家包飯，每日有多少包飯作夥計挑担經過。因爲「冷飯」是屬於他們的。</p>
<p>向商販進攻</p>
<p>中國人的店鋪素來樂善好施，除平日需索有求必應外，每値節期賞給數必更多。尢其是街頭的地攤小販，爲了不願結怨於此輩老弟兄，對此類討賞也往往忍痛撥付。凡此種種，都是該地段爺淑輩的主要收入，集腋成麥，數亦　然可觀。除了拿出一部份作爲小鬼輩的裏澆之資外，大部均人私囊。故凡佔有「桶子」的爺叔，便可以左右逢源，不愁來路斷絕。至於平日的餐食，自有小鬼以搶來冷飯孝敬。所以桶子眞是丐帮的生命錢，一如兵家必爭之地然。</p>
<p>丐帮向商店攤販索錢，積以年月，在商販目認爲一種寃枉錢，但丐帮却態度十分恭　，裝作爲商販自願給付的樣子。如有他帮無賴謀不利於商販時，槪由老弟兄仗義而出代打不平。事實上他　無賴原與本帮互通聲氣，名爲保護，其實祗是一種變相的敲詐行爲。但如果商販拒絕給賞，老弟兄便會鬼計百出，對小販百般搬弄，唆使他帮無賴乘機欺侮。</p>
<p>如係食物攤，便大家聚食後不付一文走開，或在攤物上澆倒火油，非迫得攤販畏難付款不止。據該帮中發言人宣稱，這實因地盤難得佔有。如果對某些攤販一度示弱，勢將使其他商販爭相效允，打斷了丐帮的生命綫。因此不得不「窮形極相，藉收懲一儆百之効」。商販如果鳴　追捕，亦屬無補於事。因爲前此「租界」的巡捕對於此輩「　三」最感頭疼，此輩視警局如客棧，在拘留所中有食有住，並不認爲苦事。捕房裏的洋大人不但不情願讓此輩汚穢的老弟兄沾汚了他們整潔的牢房。</p>
<h3>車廂即社會</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>再沒有比目前上海車廂更能够形容今日的社會了。裏面有：擠（排擠），軋（傾軋），舞弊（揩油），暗偸（扒手），明偸（不買票），詐欺（買票不足），濫用職　（車子過站不停），草菅人命（乘客正在下車或登車即行開車），有我無人（抽煙）</p>
<p>看看車廂再看看社會，覺得今日社會的光怪陸離並不足怪，看看社會再看看車廂，允覺得理所必然。</p>
<h3>老生常談</h3>
<p>— 洪果</p>
<p>在目今都市裏，大家終日忙於生活問題，忙於追逐名利，不知有多少人，缺乏的不是維他命而是運動。</p>
<p>運動，體育，這熱悉而俗氣的口號，當我們在小學時代就被宣導着，但迄至今日，不知有多多少少的人，吃了一個雷同的虧：沒有運動！</p>
<p>如果世上眞有萬靈的補品，那補品是：不斷而適當的運勸！</p>
<h3>中外有詞</h3>
<p>— 國鴻</p>
<p>有一次一個外國朋友對我講了一些下面的話：</p>
<p>「你們中國人有些難以描摹的幽默，而往往將生命作爲幽默的資本。譬如進餐吧！許多人一桌菜，張三一筷，李四一匙，把菜湯弄成洗筷水；把佳餚變成涶沫堆甚至明知同桌中有患T.B.的或其他傳染症的，竟然亦毫不顧忌。我有一次看不過了，勸他們實行分食制—這在我們美國是早已實行了合他們當面敷衍了我一番，背着我卻在說「我們中國人用不着他外國人一樣的衛生」！</p>
<h3>三毛</h3>

<p>星期雜談　怎樣度過星期天？</p>
<h3>小公務員</h3>
<p>— 劉隨</p>
<p>星期日之於我們小公務員，猶如一粒外層塗着糖衣的藥片，也像一味毫不能激起任何作用的甘草茶。</p>
<p>說星期日像藥片，因爲牠本身帶有濃重的苦澀味。公務員的苦澀生活是宿命的，捉襟見肘，寅吃卯糧，歲月的步子是艱滯而又沉鬱，像一段迢遙倦怠的旅程；旅程中當然渴待驛站，星期日就是驛站，這驛站也就是藥片外　的糖衣，糖衣總是能給予你以短暫的誘惑和安慰的。但是，糖衣的消蝕依舊是苦澀的持續，正如你消受了星期日的享受之後，仍不能不用顫抖而又歷縮的心情，再度步向那永無　　的倦怠的人生旅程一樣。</p>
<p>說星期日像甘草茶，因爲　本身並不能使你嘗到益補塡虧，起死回生的欣悅。中國　劑中缺少不了甘草的陪襯，也像我們生活中不能沒有星期日的點綴一樣。甘草因藥性而異其功能，星期日也因人的貧富而有酸甜；星期日的影戲院要加價，星期日的公園裏塞滿了優遊徵逐的人。還是坐在家裏吧！家裏又有什麽値得留連？蕭然四壁，日光都是憂鬱的，寂寞悽遲，空閑更會　痛你的幻想。像輕呷一杯甘草茶，僅僅一縷淸甜，你生活上的沉疴決不會因此而有起色。</p>
<p>小公務員的人生是一泓永恒的止水，星期日不過是止水中偶見的漣漪；漣漪不能掀起止水的波瀾，星期日也不會帶給我們以難有的生之喜悅。</p>
<h3>小丘八們</h3>
<p>— 大兵</p>
<p>「一，二，三，四！」「齊步走！」的日子過得太使人乏味了。</p>
<p>單調而又枯燥的軍營生活，使我們每天盼望着星期日的到來，但是星期日不見得都是屬於我們的，要不輸値，不服役，一個月裏祇有一兩次能够到外面來鬆一口氣。</p>
<p>說來眞怪，我們難得到外而來玩玩，許多人好像對我們這難得出來的一次也感到討厭。戲院裏看見我們就放出一副沒奈何的神氣，它們的招待國軍，並不在星期日。電車巾買票和乘客似乎一背着我們就擠眉眼，做鬼臉，到店裏去買點東西，店員們更是怪聲怪氣的和你說國語，越聽不懂他越要和你　　，心裏委實按捺不下一股火動，剛要舉手，摸摸袋裏祇有一千多塊錢，十元鈔票倒佔了一大疊，算了，也難怪他們！</p>
<p>星期日這一天過得真快，在馬路上蹓了兩國已到黃昏了，想到上操時那一種慢吞吞的勁兒，眞是氣得要哭出來、老天也專喜歡作弄我們的。</p>
<p>星期日在咱身上好像是一個影子，捉不住他，又放不了他。總是那麽不痛不癢地，難過透了。眞想槌它一頓！</p>
<h3>無晚帝王</h3>
<p>— 洪因</p>
<p>我常說：「新聞記者好像天天過星期而實際上三百六十五天無一天星期。」倒是從前在工部局時代，抗日報紙被罰停刊的時候，却是意　的假期。現在，時代更不　我　休息，連今年新舊　年關和新年，恐怕各報也都不見得會停刊。上一次國慶，各報仍然出版。</p>
<p>星期天，這一個「可愛」的日子，對於日夜緊張於採訪或剪刀漿糊的我們，是並不重要的。如果說報人有星期假日的話，那麽，幹外勤的應當睡一整天，讓神經鬆弛一下，幹內勤的，應該在星六之夜睡一整夜，星期這天晒一整天太陽。</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Adjourns Today; Resolves to Establish Nine Groups to Review the Draft Constitution; to Convene the Sixth Meeting Tomorrow to Continue Discussion</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our Nanjing office, 30th] The National Assembly will adjourn in the morning and afternoon today. The Friendship Association of National Assembly Representatives from the four provinces of 热 (Rehe), 察 (Chahar), 绥 (Suiyuan), and 宁 (Ningxia) will host a reception for reporters at 10:00 AM in the lounge of the Assembly Hall. Additionally, all Mongolian representatives will also host a reception for reporters at the same location at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The sixth plenary session will be held at 10:00 AM on the second day of the month to continue the discussion on the draft constitution. The Secretariat of the National Assembly has prepared a form for representatives to register for the draft constitution subcommittees. The form divides the subcommittees into eight groups and will be distributed to each representative for signing and submission to the procedural committee at the sixth session on December 2nd.</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from our Nanjing office, 30th] The fifth session of the National Assembly was held at 9:50 AM on the 30th. Firstly, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou announced: "Of the 1,744 National Assembly representatives announced by the National Government, a total of 1,636 have registered as of 9:00 AM this morning. 1,118 representatives are present today, which is sufficient to meet the legal quorum for the meeting to commence." Presided over by Chairman Yu Bin, the ceremony was conducted as customary. The Chairman announced: "All representatives who have registered but have not yet taken the oath will take the oath today." Subsequently, Chu Zhuan became the leader on the stage, and each person taking the oath raised their hand and read the oath aloud from their original position. (The names of the officials swearing the oath are listed later). Furthermore, representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party did not participate in the supplementary oath this morning, and a date will be selected to hold it again. Subsequently, the fifth group of the presidium entered the presidium seats, including Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Yunwu, Liu Zijing, etc., who successively ascended the rostrum. The Secretariat then reported: (1) Reading of the minutes of the fourth general assembly, (2) Reading of the draft regulations for the review of the Constitution of the Republic of China. Discussion began, first by Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen explaining the regulations for the review committee, followed by representatives freely expressing their opinions. Speakers were extremely enthusiastic, including Song Qiaoshu, Sun Shengwu, Hu Jue, Liu Zongping, Chen Guyuan, Zhang Shiwu, Li Chukuang, Lou Tongsun, Chen Changheng, Wei Tingsheng, Zhang Gai, Kong Geng, Zhong Tianxin, Liu Ceheng, and others. Many written proposals were also submitted. The Assembly took a fifteen-minute break at 11:15 AM and resumed at 11:30 AM. At 12:00 PM, Chairman Yu Bin announced: "The opinions expressed by the representatives today and the written opinions will be collated by the Secretariat and submitted to the Presidium for revision before being submitted to the Assembly for discussion. If the representatives have any further opinions, they may also be submitted to the Secretariat for collation. If there are no objections, it will be considered passed." The meeting hall responded with no objections, and it was declared passed.</p>
<p>The main points of the review regulations are as follows: Draft Regulations for the Review of the Constitution of the Republic of China: Explanation: After the Assembly has broadly exchanged opinions on the draft constitution, it will enter the stage of being submitted for review. The proposals from various representatives regarding the constitution have also been submitted successively. The Presidium has decided to establish the following eight review committees: (1) First Review Committee: "Review of the general principles, the rights and obligations of the people, and elections." (2) Second Review Committee: "Review of the National Assembly and the implementation, amendment, and interpretation of the constitution." (3) Third Review Committee: "Review of the President, administration, and legislation." (4) Fourth Review Committee: "Review of the judiciary, examinations, and oversight." (5) Fifth Review Committee: "Review of the division of powers between the central and local governments." (6) Sixth Review Committee: "Review of the provincial and county systems." (7) Seventh Review Committee: "Review of basic national policies." Representatives attending the Assembly may freely register for one or two of the above review committees. (8) Comprehensive Review Committee: Composed of two people elected from the conveners of each review committee, fifteen people selected by the Presidium, and one person elected from each representative unit. Each review committee may establish several subgroups to facilitate progress and conduct separate research.</p>
<h3>Representative Opinions to be Finalized; to be Submitted to the Assembly by the Presidium</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Nanjing office, 30th] Opinions of representatives at the morning session of the National Assembly: (1) The third and fourth review committees should be merged, because the third review committee reviews the presidential administration and legislation, and the fourth standing committee reviews the judicial examination and supervision. It is not necessary to separate Pu Bu Lian, and should be merged into a side committee. (2) The fifth and sixth review committees should also be merged, because the fifth review committee reviews the powers of the central and local governments, and the sixth review committee has a close relationship with the provincial and county systems. (3) The comprehensive review committee should be renamed the eighth review committee to make it consistent with the names of the above seven articles. (4) The organizational components of the comprehensive review committee should be increased. Only two conveners from each review committee are too few and should be changed to three from each committee. (5) The constituents of the comprehensive committee should each have one representative unit, which is too few and should be increased to five. (6) A review committee for reviewing border issues should be added to the review committee. (7) The scope of review of the sixth review committee was originally the provincial and county system, but now "Ye Tibet" and other places can be added. (8) The nature of each committee is connected, so there is no need to merge, and it can be done in the form of a joint meeting. (9) The chapter before the chapter is also planned within the scope of the planning committee (10) The number of members of the committee selected by the presidium should be reduced to a few. (11) The scope of review of the fifth review committee is too large, and a group should be added. (12) The grouping method should be divided separately, such as national defense, diplomacy, education, etc.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our Nanjing office, 30th] The fifth session of the National Assembly amended and passed the Draft Regulations for the Review of the Constitution of the Republic of China, dividing it into nine groups. In addition to the eight groups decided by the Presidium, an eighth review committee (reviewing the Mongolian and Tibetan local systems) was added. The Comprehensive Review Committee is listed as the ninth group. (Comprehensive review of mutually related matters of each group and organization of chapters and texts of the entire draft). The Comprehensive Review Committee is composed of one person mutually elected from each review committee, two persons elected from each convener, nine persons selected by the Presidium, and three persons elected from each representative unit. Each review committee may establish several small levels separately for research to facilitate progress, and relevant review committees may conduct joint reviews when necessary.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our Nanjing office, 30th] The fifth meeting of the National Assembly continued at 3:30 PM on the 30th, with Wu Tiecheng as chairman. First, he reported on the results of the morning's discussion on the "Draft Regulations for the Review of the Constitution of the Republic of China," which is being summarized and will be submitted to the Chuanda Assembly for discussion after being reviewed and finalized by the Presidium.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Youth Democratic Socialist Party Did Not Participate in the Supplementary Oath</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Nanjing office, 30th] Representatives from both the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party were absent from the National Assembly on the morning of the 30th. It is reported that this was to avoid taking the supplementary oath. The Youth Party subsequently issued a written statement as follows: "We have always respected Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the creator of the Republic of China, and we also sympathize with our Kuomintang friends who believe in Mr. Sun's teachings. However, when Chairman Chiang submitted the draft constitution, he clearly stated that he would return power to the people and begin constitutional government. Therefore, we believe that the freedom of belief and freedom of thought stipulated in the draft constitution should be realized immediately. We respect the freedom of belief of our Kuomintang friends, while maintaining our own freedom of thought. This is why we do not participate in the supplementary oath." The Democratic Socialist Party made no statement, but did not deny when asked by reporters whether the absence was due to the oath issue. When asked whether they would take the oath separately, they replied: "It depends on the government's opinion."</p>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, this city] Zuo Shunsheng, a National Assembly representative of the Youth Party, took the night train from Beijing to Shanghai on the evening of the 30th and will arrive here at 8:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Northern Representatives Advocate for the Capital to be in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Shan Yang News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Article 7 of the draft constitution regarding the capital of the Republic of China stipulates that "The capital of the Republic of China shall be in Nanjing." Qi Zhihou, a representative of Suiyuan at the National Assembly, recently submitted a proposal to the Assembly, listing fourteen reasons for advocating that the capital be located in Beiping. This proposal was co-signed by 380 representatives, including Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Mo Dehui, Kong Decheng, Ding Weifen, Bai Yunti, Bo Ru, Su Ting, Tong Guanxian, and Zhao Qingyu. The original text is as follows: "In order to defend the Northeast, consolidate national defense, and prevent further invasion of our territory, it is appropriate to establish the capital in Beiping. Whether or not this should be decided by public resolution." Reasons: (1) Establishing the capital in Beiping, close to strong neighbors, is more sensitive and easier to take preventive measures and respond appropriately. (2) Beiping has a majestic terrain and can control the overall situation. (3) Beiping has convenient transportation and is a railway center. (4) Beiping is located in the population center of the nine provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Northeast, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan. (5) Beiping will be the center of heavy industry construction in North China in the future. (6) Beiping is close to the Northeast, and sea and river transportation is convenient, so there is no need to worry about food, and meat can be obtained from Mongolia. (7) Beiping has a cool climate, suitable for human health conditions, and suitable for government personnel to work all year round. (8) Establishing the capital in Beiping can attract people to develop northward and cultivate a spirit of perseverance and cold resistance to enrich the border areas. (9) Establishing the capital in Beiping can balance north-south development and break down north-south barriers. (10) Beiping is a famous historical capital with a long history. (11) Beiping is close to the ocean and can take into account maritime development. (12) Beiping's architecture is grand in scale, sufficient to meet the needs of establishing a capital, without the need for large-scale construction, which can save financial resources. (13) Beiping is a cultural center. (14) Beiping has beautiful scenery.</p>
<h3>Representatives Broadly Express Opinions on the Draft Constitution; Mongolian Representatives Request Explicit Stipulation of the League-Banner System</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Nanjing office, 30th] Various representatives at the fifth plenary session of the National Assembly on the afternoon of the 30th broadly expressed their opinions on the draft constitution. The details are as follows: Mongolian representatives Wu Yunpeng and Bai Rui stated successively: If the constitution can safeguard the interests of all ethnic groups in the country, then from the perfect draft constitution amendment, Chapter 11, "Local System," should be changed to "Provincial and County System," and the status of "League" is sometimes equated with provinces and sometimes subject to discriminatory regulations. The status of "Banner" has never been mentioned, and the word cannot be found in the entire text. However, in fact, after the independence of Outer Mongolia, the distribution of more than 7 million Mongolian compatriots in Inner Mongolia, from the Northeast to Xinjiang, is extremely important to national defense in the north. Regarding the regulations of the Mongolian League-Banner autonomous law promulgated in the past, the requirement to explicitly stipulate the League-Banner system in the constitution is not deliberately novel, nor is it a force to divide the hearts of Inner Mongolian compatriots. Treating Mongolian compatriots with high sympathy and giving them true equality is the way to consolidate national defense.</p>
<p>Li Zhongxiang, a representative from the Gan region, put forward two points of opinion on the catalog of the draft constitution: (1) Chapters 4 to 9, a total of six chapters, should be merged into one chapter, called "National Government," to establish the status of its ruling power organ and parallel it with Chapter 3, "National Assembly," as the political power organ. The "National Government" chapter is divided into six sections. Except for the "President" section, the word "Yuan" (院, court/branch) of the five Yuans should be explicitly stated. Otherwise, the distinction between political power and ruling power will be unclear from the beginning of the catalog. After many years, the National Assembly will tend to disappear, abandoning the teachings of the founding father completely. (2) Chapter 11, "Provincial and County System," should be revised to "Local System," otherwise administrative units other than provinces and counties will have nowhere to be placed.</p>
<p>He Yang, a selected representative, first stated that the amendment has three advantages: guaranteeing people's freedom, recognizing the legitimacy of political parties, and improving the status of local governments. Then he listed its shortcomings as follows: (1) The central government system is contradictory, neither a presidential system nor a cabinet system, neither a unicameral system nor a bicameral system, neither a five-power system nor a three-power system, a four-not-like, with no advantages. (2) The examination and oversight systems are not fully utilized, ignoring the elements of rule by people, violating facts and tradition. (3) Although the powers between the central government and local governments have been divided, the powers between local provinces and counties are not clear. (4) The spirit of nationalism is lacking, and the status of ethnic minorities is not taken into account. (5) National territory can be changed by law, which is not as stable as the provision in the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft that "it shall not be changed without a resolution of the National Assembly." He advocated retaining and expanding the advantages of the amendment and removing or remedying its shortcomings.</p>
<p>Guo Xin, a overseas Chinese representative, advocated: (1) The words "of the people, by the people, and for the people" in Article 1 should be deleted. (2) The location of the capital in Article 7 does not need to be explicitly listed in the constitution. (3) Add the words "medicine" in Article 145.</p>
<p>Chang Zongyou, a representative from the Anhui region, advocated that the national economy should be listed as a special chapter. In the future, the country should be built on agriculture, and more attention should be paid to agriculture.</p>
<p>Deng Jiayan, a selected representative, said that the provisions on the powers of examination and supervision in the draft constitutional amendment cannot give full play to their inherent advantages.</p>
<p>Chen Qianxi, a representative from the Sichuan region, said that if the National Assembly's constitution-making follows the teachings of the founding father, it must implement the five-power constitution, and political power and governance power must be divided. Now, the power of the National Assembly is so small that it is almost non-existent. If it is based on Montesquieu, it is acceptable, but it is not based on Mr. Zhongshan. Should people choose five powers or three powers, it should be decided first. If you want three powers, you can draft a constitution based on the parliamentary system, but you must not establish the name and abandon the reality. Constitution-making is a century-long undertaking. We cannot stubbornly be impulsive, nor can we blindly obey.</p>
<p>A representative from the district expressed two opinions on "Basic National Policies": (1) "National economy" cannot be generally stipulated. In the constitutions of various countries in the world, it is listed as a special chapter, and modern human economic and social activities are becoming increasingly complex. The chapter of the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft should be submitted for discussion and supplemented as necessary, which will greatly benefit the national economy and people's livelihood. (2) "Education" is also a national plan and should be listed in the draft. The provisions of the Fifth-Fifth Draft regarding free education for school-age children, national education, and education funding are all reasonable and should be adopted.</p>
<p>Chen Xiaowei, a representative of the Social Development Party, believed that the draft constitutional amendment lacked timeliness and national defense. If the command authority and the governance authority are not unified, it is equal to useless. It is difficult to establish a country in the "atomic age" with its regulations. Please give serious consideration to the conference. After the break from 4:45 PM to 5:15 PM, Chairman Wu announced that, according to Article 31 of the Rules of Procedure, the agenda was changed to discuss the draft constitution review regulations first. Deputy Secretary-General Lei Bao reported on the amendments summarized by the Presidium. After a vote, the "Draft Amendments to the Review Regulations" was passed with 951 votes in favor and continued to be broadly discussed.</p>
<p>Tang Qiyu, a representative of a vocational profession in Jiangsu Province, proposed a combination of vocational election system and detailed agricultural policy.</p>
<p>Pi Yishu, a women representative, expressed her opinion: (1) The occupational election system is conducive to economic development and development. (2) Women account for half of the population. If they cannot participate in politics, it is not a national politics, and it is not true democracy. Try to observe any country in the world, any party with this view, are trying to support women's rights, requiring that women should account for 30% of the elections in various units.</p>
<p>Wang, a representative from the E district, advocated that "education" should be listed as a special chapter, and the purpose of education should be clearly stated in accordance with national conditions, and the education of the Three Principles of the People should be stipulated. Social education should also be included.</p>
<p>Finally, Liu Jiashu, a representative from the Gan district, said, "In the draft constitutional amendment, the regulations of the Legislative Yuan and the National Assembly are completely against the teachings of the founding father and must be thoroughly revised. How many martyrs have we sacrificed for the Three Principles of the People, and how much blood and sweat have we shed? We must not rashly abandon our revolutionary goals and throw ourselves into the arms of capitalism." He often won enthusiastic approval, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Communist Army in Northeast Fails to Attack Nong'an; National Army Enters Halahai; Communist Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department Denies Receiving Dalian</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Beiping office, 30th] Information from transportation circles here: After the Communist army's attack on Chengan on the Changbai Line in the Northeast failed, they retreated rapidly and withdrew from Halahai, an important town on the line. The National Army subsequently entered the town on the 8th, and the Communist army is retreating towards the Songhua River.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our Beiping office, 30th] Regarding the foreign reports that the National Army has entered Dalian, officials here have said that they have not heard of it. According to information from transportation circles: The Communist army in that area has indeed gradually concentrated in Dalian, about 10,000 people, and seems to be preparing to transport them by water from Dalian to Yantai. Therefore, the National Army in the Gaiping area has also entered Xiongyuecheng, Xujiatun, Wanjialing, Songheng Wangjia, and Fuxian without fighting. By the 28th, they had advanced to Wafangdian, in front of Fuxian. The situation yesterday and today is still unknown. Wafangdian is about 200 li away from Dalian.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our Beiping office, 30th] Xue Zizheng, Chief of Staff of the Communist Party of the Military Mediation Department, stated: There are no Communist troops in Dalian, and Dalian has never been received. However, there are Communist troops active outside the city of Dalian.</p>

<h3>The Fifth Meeting of the National Assembly is Peaceful and Calm</h3>
<p>— Our reporters Zhang Ming and Pu Dejie</p>
<p>Yu Bin appeared on the rostrum with the demeanor of a bishop, and everyone admired his dignity, kindness, and benevolence. After the first bell rang, Yu Bin was the first to take his seat and sit in the center.</p>
<p>Yu Bin's voice of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will was the clearest read by the chairmen in the past.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party were absent in the morning, and the empty seats immediately aroused the reporter's sense of smell. After inquiring, I learned that they hoped to choose a more solemn date separately.</p>
<p>When the chairman mentioned discussing the methods of the review committee, someone immediately stood up to object, saying that the case should be submitted next Saturday, because only more than 30 of the 1,000-plus people had expressed their opinions on the draft constitution, and they had not achieved the freedom to exchange opinions widely. Subsequently, Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen stated that the discussion of the methods of the review committee was to prepare for the convenience of the representatives to participate in the review, and it was by no means a handover of the review. This storm subsided.</p>
<p>Reading the regulations of the committee was the first time Lei Zhen showed his face at the meeting. This unsung hero, who had tried his best for peace talks, stood up on the stage for the first time, and many reporters felt close to him.</p>
<p>No. 1090 suddenly stood up and said: "I have sent a request for a speech twice, but I still haven't had a chance." The chairman immediately said: "You can speak now." This extra democratic style made the speaker flattered.</p>
<p>No. 1090 began, and overflowed the scope of the speech, although the audience responded with mocking and boos, but he still stubbornly said: "There are too few opportunities, I will only finish in five minutes." However, the masses were difficult to suppress, and they responded with mocking and boos. Even Minister Bai sitting in the front row laughed loudly. The chairman rang the bell and could not stop it. Finally, he himself realized that no one was listening even if he said it. After many unsuccessful negotiations, he left the stage unhappy. This farce came to an end.</p>
<p>When the Mongolian representative went on stage and was expressing his opinion on the frontier issue, a certain representative suddenly responded with a "Chi Chi" sound. After a while, a corner of the venue immediately fell into chaos. It turned out that a certain representative's "Chi Chi" provoked public outrage, believing that he intentionally deprived the frontier representative of the opportunity to speak. They unanimously wanted to expel him from the venue. At one time, venue staff and reporters rushed to the arguing area to interview the facts. Subsequently, the misunderstanding was resolved before it subsided. This is the second good mirror today.</p>
<p>Most of the female representatives paid special attention to the rights of women, but Tao Xuan, a female representative, told reporters that there was no need to stipulate the rights of women in other articles. If it is enough as it is now, because the part specially stipulated for women is equal, the part not stipulated is unequal. It can also be said that it is equal in general without special regulations.</p>
<p>Old man Kong Geng is highly valued, surrounded by reporters before and after the meeting, and government leaders also shook hands and talked with him in particular.</p>
<p>The entrance and exit of news reporters are extremely restricted. You enter the assembly hall through the side door and enter the venue through the main entrance. There is no slightest arbitrariness.</p>
<p>Before the afternoon meeting, the representatives changed their badges in the lounge. Because many of the original vermilion ones were lost, it was decided to change them to dark red. At the same time, new badges were issued with the number of the commemorative badge. They were circular, white, with the national flag on the upper half and the words "National Assembly (large characters) Representative (small characters)" in red on the lower half. The outer blue circle has a silver border, which is quite beautiful. Ma Shen Huilian said with a smile after wearing the new red badge: "It's like being a bride." Ma Chaojun said: "Okay, madam."</p>
<p>The afternoon meeting was chaired by Wu Tiecheng. Mr. Wu was tall, loud, and extraordinary in his demeanor. He had a stabilizing effect on the order of the meeting. He was comparable to Yu Bin in the morning and evening, but he also felt bad about the voting machine and the method of saying the electric button. "Those who agree, press this" and then gestured, "This, this voting machine." There was a burst of laughter from the audience and the lights next to the stage lit up.</p>
<p>He Yangling, a selected representative, said: "Some people casually call the colleagues who put forward opinions on the draft constitutional amendment the opposition, which is wrong. As far as I am concerned, I advocate that the advantages of the amendment should be retained and expanded, and the shortcomings should be removed or improved. I admit that I am a revisionist."</p>
<p>Chang Zonghui, a representative from the Anhui region, spoke like a "Sichuan storyteller," lengthening his voice, putting on a tone, and slowly performing, causing laughter and applause from the entire audience. Even he himself couldn't help but laugh, and everyone was happy.</p>
<p>Deng Jiayan, a selected representative, wearing black glasses, said as soon as he opened his mouth, "I neither oppose nor support the draft constitutional amendment." He also said: "Regarding the great use of the powers of examination and supervision, I have heard the founding father say in person that this is one of the greatest contributions to the political system in our country for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Puquan slowly walked to Cui Gaihua No. 517 at 5:20, sat in the empty seat of Yu Junxian No. 518, and talked quietly for a few words, seemingly concerned about her physical strength. The young people who saw this old couple in the side were deeply moved by the sweetness of their love, smiling and watching.</p>
<p>The meeting on the 30th was calm and uneventful all day. The representatives sat and rested, the reporters were equal to attending classes, and the staff were relatively relaxed. At the same time, the ventilation equipment in the venue was insufficient, it was warm but also very stuffy, everyone's faces were red, and people who had not slept well the night before felt a headache and yawned from time to time.</p>

<h3>Graduation Ceremony at the Central Police Academy: President Chiang Offers Earnest Admonition, Encouraging Officer Cadets to Shoulder the Important Task of National Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The third class of the Advanced Police Administration Research Program and the third class of the Police Administration Training Program of the Central Police Academy, having completed their training, held their graduation ceremony at the school outside Guanghua Gate at 10:00 AM on the 30th of this month. The graduating researchers of the Advanced Research Program consisted of 57 demobilized officers at the general level and senior police cadres transferred for training, while the Police Administration Training Program consisted of over 400 demobilized military officers at the lieutenant colonel and colonel levels. The weather was clear after a recent snowfall, with auspicious light shining everywhere. Commander-in-Chief of Logistics Huang Zhenqiu, Director of Education of the Central Training Corps Huang Jie, Director of the Police Headquarters Tang Zong, as well as leading party and government officials, guests, faculty, graduating students, and over a hundred other individuals, totaling over 4,000 people, gathered together in harmony. At 9:40 AM, President Chiang, the chairman and school president, arrived at the school amidst his busy political affairs, accompanied by Director of Education Li Shizhen, and entered the ceremony platform to personally preside over the ceremony. The music played, and the ceremony proceeded as prescribed. The chairman and school president, recognizing that the graduating cadets were all middle and senior-level cadres in police construction, offered several points of earnest admonition: (1) The construction of a modern nation relies first on the stability of social order, and the establishment of good social order relies especially on police officers who have undergone the baptism of revolution to undertake police work at all levels, which will then be successful; (2) The transfer of demobilized military officers to police officers is of great significance. Having already sacrificed and struggled in the service of the military, completing the Northern Expedition and the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, everyone must use even stronger spirit and effort to shoulder the great task of national reconstruction afterward; (3) The nation must first build up its police force, and the work of building up the police force is extremely arduous. Since everyone has received strict military education, they are not only the backbone of the national army but also the backbone of police construction. It is hoped that everyone will use the training and experience they have received, using methods of leading troops, to train general police officers and constables, becoming new police cadres, and using this to organize the people, becoming good citizens. In this way, we can obtain good order and create a modern nation. It is hoped that everyone will work together to shoulder this important task… ” The admonition lasted about an hour, and all the officers and cadets in the audience were moved. This was followed by a speech by a representative of the graduating cadets, the ceremony was completed, and photographs were taken. At 11:30 AM, a group meal was held, during which Director of Education Li and Director Tang delivered speeches in succession, their words carrying great weight, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Situation in the North After the Ceasefire: Interview with Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters: A Large-Scale Offensive by the Communist Army Is Unlikely</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th] Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, at the request of reporters, spoke freely about the situation in the North after the government announced the ceasefire order. He said: Judging by the overall strength of the Communist army, they may cause disturbances in the future, but a large-scale offensive will be impossible. Moreover, at a time when the government has declared a ceasefire and the National Assembly is in session, there is no reason for the National Army to launch an offensive. Therefore, the Communist propaganda that the National Army will attack Yan'an is nothing more than fear. As long as the Communist Party does not establish a government independently, the National Army will never attack Yan'an. However, it is unknown whether the Communist Party will take advantage of the National Army's ceasefire period to attack the National Army. Mr. Wang also said: The current priority of the National Army is to consolidate the security of the recovered areas and ensure transportation lines, that is, to focus on pacification work. He continued to explain the current situation in various provinces: (1) In Shandong, due to superior economic and transportation conditions, the Communist army will still be somewhat active, but it will be impossible to cut off the Jinpu Railway and attack the south corridor again. Their purpose of harassment is still defense, as they are unable to hold onto a single stronghold without retreating. Even if a stronghold is occasionally occupied, they must eventually withdraw. The waterway connection between Dalian and Yantai is also constantly under the surveillance of our navy and air force. (2) In Hebei, the Communist army retains considerable strength in the mountains west of Zhuozhou and Baoding on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, ranging from 180 miles to just over ten miles from the transportation lines. There are approximately 50,000 Communist troops between Zhuoxian and Shijiazhuang. Currently, Fangshunqiao and Yujiazhuang, south of Baoding, are not yet fully under our control. It is no longer possible for the Communist army to carry out large-scale destruction as before. (3) In Shanxi, the Communist army's continuous capture of strongholds in western Shanxi is out of fear of an attack on northern Shaanxi, and to maintain crossing points on the Yellow River and reinforce northern Shaanxi. In fact, Yonghe, Daning, and other places have no major military value, and the Communist army will not attack Yan'an. There will also be no major problems in Datong in northern Shanxi, and the Communist army's reinforcement in that direction is also intended to support northern Shaanxi. (4) In the province of Chahar, there are generally no problems. The Pingzhang Railway line can be maintained. Focus is on stabilizing the local area. There is still Communist army activity in northern Chahar, in Chifeng. The loss of Longguan is not a major problem.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th] Regarding the rumor that the Communist Party's headquarters may move from northern Shaanxi to the northeast, reporters inquired of two key figures in the northeast and the north. Their opinions were the same, believing that it was quite possible due to the Communist Party's fear of being attacked in northern Shaanxi and the superior economic and geographical conditions in the northeast. The key figure in the northeast also said: Before the Battle of Siping, the Communist Party had already made this preparation, but after the disastrous defeat in that battle, their plan was also frustrated.</p>

<p>[Report from This City] Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Cheng Zimin, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Land Administration Bureau, passed through Shanghai last night to take the Jiangkang transport ship to Tongru area in northern Jiangsu to guide political affairs and comfort the people. Xu Mojia, Administrative Inspector and concurrently Security Commander of the Fourth District, recently completed his inspection of political affairs in Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, and Jingjiang counties and returned to Nantong on the same ship. Li Yunliang, manager of the Dada and Datong Shipping Companies joint operating office, Zhang Jingli, manager of the Dasheng Yarn Factory, and Zhu Zhenwei, deputy manager of the Shanghai Municipal Bank, held a cocktail reception at the Huitong Hotel on the Bund on Nanjing Road at 4:00 PM yesterday, inviting important figures from various circles in Nantong who were residing in Shanghai to welcome Chairman Wang and Commissioner Xu. During the reception, local leader Zhang Jingli first reported on the industrial, educational, and rehabilitation situation in northern Jiangsu. The Dasheng and other important industrial plants in Nantong have resumed work, and educational undertakings, from the textile, medical, and agricultural departments of Nantong College to the primary and secondary schools in the recovered areas, have resumed classes. He hoped that the government would assist in the salt reclamation business to develop the vast land of 14 million acres.</p>
<p>Next, Li Yunliang, a representative of the shipping industry, reported on the situation of water transportation in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>At this point, Chairman Wang Maogong, amidst applause, reported on the provincial government's measures over the past year and three months. Mr. Wang declared in a humble tone: The wounds inflicted on the people of Jiangsu by the enemy and puppets over the past eight years were originally hoped to be healed after victory, but because the Communist army occupies northern Jiangsu and other places, the people are still in deep water. He himself has been caring for the displaced, without rest, and various constructions for management, education, support, and health have not yet been developed, working diligently day and night. Now that order in northern Jiangsu is becoming more stable, all general and financial affairs should be coordinated with the pacification situation. Northern Jiangsu is the hometown of his youth, and the various sufferings of the people are constantly on his mind. Therefore, he has repeatedly visited the people to understand their hardships. This is the fifth time he has gone to observe the situation. Recently, he asked local gentry for valuable opinions on developing industry, expanding agriculture, maintaining transportation, restoring schools, and caring for the displaced, and he will sincerely accept them and follow the elders of Jiangsu to strengthen the promotion of the recovery of northern Jiangsu and even the entire province.</p>

<h3>The Difficulties of Overseas Chinese Economy</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Economic Conference, which has been on the verge of opening for more than 20 years, finally held an Overseas Chinese Economic Symposium in Beijing the day before yesterday, organized by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The five themes were approved in principle in an instant, and all the time was consumed by the overseas Chinese firing cannons and machine guns. Their every word reflected their inner anxiety and distress. Their cannons and machine guns, to put it kindly, were "complaining," and to put it bluntly, were "grumbling." They all slammed the table and shouted, every sentence was a word of indignation, every sentence was a word of blood and tears. In the tense emotions, they inevitably spoke bluntly and quickly, but the motive was very valuable.</p>
<p>Many problems are the same at home and abroad, and there are also many problems that only exist abroad and not at home, or that exist at home and not abroad. The anxiety and distress of the overseas Chinese are exactly the same as those of the people in China. They all feel like the entire Mount Tai is pressing on them, with a heart as heavy as lead, anxiously like ants on a hot pot, and depressed like a dumb person eating Coptis chinensis. The Overseas Chinese economy is a part of the national economy, closely related. We ask for the development of the Overseas Chinese economy, which is exactly what Minister Wang Yunwu said in three points: one is the recovery of the Overseas Chinese economy, the second is Overseas Chinese investment in China, and the third is the promotion of overseas markets.</p>
<p>When it comes to the recovery of the Overseas Chinese economy, the problem arises. As the overseas representative said, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission kowtowed to recover the masses, and the loan of US$50 million attracted the attention of the world, but a year later, the overseas Chinese did not receive a single cent of the loan. This kind of money does not need the country to subsidize the cost, that is, the overseas Chinese in the local area deposit in the Central and Jiaotong Banks, and the overseas Chinese transfer funds from foreign banks, lending to the overseas Chinese, and there is also interest that can be cheap. At present, what the overseas Chinese have obtained is only "verbal benefits." It is difficult for the overseas Chinese to travel to China, the Burmese representative spoke loudly, and the foreign currency brought back was sold to the government at the government rate. Now they are required to buy part of the foreign currency at a list price in order to return to their original place of residence, but they cannot get it. If people have not left, how can they recover?</p>
<p>For Overseas Chinese to invest in China, it is first necessary to protect the existing Overseas Chinese property in China to make them feel at ease, but the fact is the opposite. Wen Jupeng, an old revolutionary comrade of the Dutch East Indies delegation, said in tears that his seven houses in Four Lanes in Nanjing were occupied by related persons and would not be returned. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission sent a commissioner with official documents to say good things and beg everywhere, and all parties pushed back and forth, and pushed it completely clean, and it has not been recovered for a year. Huang Boyao, a representative of the United States, found in a survey in Guangdong that Overseas Chinese property was also mostly occupied. Shen Lingqiao, a leader of the Overseas Chinese in Xiangshan, said that he had just come from the countryside in Guangdong, where there were as many bandits as cattle, running rampant in broad daylight, corrupt officials were walking the streets, and dirty officials were as many as dogs, which made people shudder. How can he muster up the courage to invest in the motherland?</p>
<p>To drink milk, you must first raise good cows, but now hoping that Overseas Chinese will return to invest in the motherland, the Overseas Chinese themselves have become destitute, and those who are not poor are also bound by the government of residence, and the funds are also not flexible and difficult to flow into the motherland. Lin Tingcheng, the former consul in Batavia, frankly told the suffering of the Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, which he had personally witnessed. The Indonesian government converted the stacks of Japanese tickets in the hands of the Overseas Chinese into 2 Indonesian currency per 100 yuan. When exchanging, they must be deposited in the bank, limiting the withdrawal to 100 yuan per month. The Dutch East Indies government allowed the Overseas Chinese to return to China, only allowing them to bring 300 guilders. The travel expenses and living expenses are already stretched, so how can there be money to invest! The same is true in Vietnam. When Overseas Chinese return to China, each person is only allowed to bring 200 Vietnamese currency, which is worth only a dozen Hong Kong dollars at the market price after conversion in Hong Kong, which is not enough for luggage handling fees, not to mention accommodation and food expenses and return travel expenses during the stay.</p>
<p>Everyone in the country is worried about the imminent great depression, business is sluggish, production is stagnant, purchasing power is weak, and high interest rates are suffocating. If you want to cure the root cause, the first thing is political unification, and the second is the stability of the currency value. However, in times of war, neither of these two paths can be achieved overnight. The way to promote lending within the possible scope today is to promote lending in the countryside and overseas. In the countryside in China, because of high wages, expensive costs, and cheap grain prices, and in the state of war, the countryside is the first victim, and farmers are struggling on the hunger line, and have long lost their purchasing power, so only overseas is the lifeline of the country's economy today. The largest market for Chinese goods overseas is of course Southeast Asia. The economic activities of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia include investment and management, labor in mines and factories, etc., and thirdly, sales. They are the "centralized sales" of local products in Southeast Asia and the "domestic distribution" of imports. The former is better done by whites and is very advanced, and the latter was initially realized by Overseas Chinese. However, in the years before the war, the Japanese had taken the place of the Overseas Chinese and replaced them by distributing goods to the natives. The Overseas Chinese have been in a precarious situation. Today, the Japanese have been driven away, which is a great opportunity for the Overseas Chinese. They can transport Chinese goods to foreign countries and sell them to the natives, and at the same time sell them to the Overseas Chinese themselves. The amount will surely be amazing.</p>
<p>Tea, medicinal materials, seafood, groceries, ceramics, etc. produced in China are generally regarded as non-essential goods in some places of residence, and foreign exchange is not allowed. Therefore, Chinese goods in overseas markets are naturally extinct, even if they are not said to be extinct. For example, in Vietnam, which claims to be friendly to China, for goods that Overseas Chinese have obtained foreign exchange; the Chinese economic bureau can levy taxes by converting the public price of Hong Kong dollars into Vietnamese currency, and the Overseas Chinese have only one way to die.</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese economy has been attacked from both inside and outside, and it is truly difficult. There is a saying in Chinese: "If you cut down a tree without cutting its roots, it will be reborn; if you block water without blocking its source, it will flow again; if you eliminate disaster without eliminating its root, it will be chaotic again." Today, the way to relieve the situation is only one sentence: Please wake up all Chinese people from beginning to end and stop the civil war! Then diplomacy can be tough, the country can be stable, and the Overseas Chinese economy will have a way out.</p>
<h3>An Impartial Discussion of the Vendor Problem</h3>
<p>Yesterday, over a thousand family members of street vendors in this city suddenly surrounded the Huangpu Police Department, demanding the release of recently detained vendors, causing a temporary disruption of order. Fortunately, the branch director accepted the family's demands and agreed to release the arrested vendors in succession, gradually restoring order. Unexpectedly, the gathered crowd continued to cause disturbances at the Lao Zha Police Department, and there were incidents of destroying shops, causing the situation to become serious. The matter has now calmed down, and we cannot help but make some brief comments.</p>
<p>First of all, we must say that while rectifying the city's appearance is indeed important, it should not affect the livelihoods of ordinary people due to the crackdown on vendors. This newspaper has repeatedly written articles urging the authorities to pay more attention to proactive measures and less to passive crackdowns regarding current municipal facilities. Vendors who obstruct traffic should indeed be banned, but those who may not necessarily obstruct public transportation should be treated leniently. In the post-war period, the people's livelihood is declining, so we should open up avenues for the people to make a living and not increase unemployment in order to maintain social order. Those who are detained for executing the order to ban vendors should be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the law. We sympathize with the vendors' petition this time, feeling the difficulty of people making a living. However, if public order is disrupted due to the petition, it will lose general sympathy. For the police authorities, banning vendors is originally the execution of orders, which is their duty and cannot be shirked. However, in the process of execution, they should be cautious, and in the face of激昂群情, they should deal with it calmly, so as not to lead to a major change.</p>
<p>However, yesterday's disturbances, although caused by the petition of the vendors' families, later went beyond the scope of the petition and involved the destruction of shops. Such disruptive behavior cannot gain the sympathy of the world. Shanghai is the foremost city in our country, and how to maintain public order in Shanghai is the duty of the government. However, every citizen has the responsibility to assist in maintaining order and cannot completely push this responsibility onto the government. Because of yesterday's disturbances, we hope that every citizen will take on this responsibility. At the same time, we urge the government to seize the opportunity and pay more attention to stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>

<h3>Rescuing Hostages and Extorting Huge Sums - District Chief Liao Zongfu Ruins Achievements in Suppressing Bandits - Interrogation Reveals Conclusive Evidence, to Be Brought to Justice</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 30th] Liao Zongfu, the district chief of Chenmu District in Su County's 11th District, led his troops to encircle and suppress Li Defu on October 12, rescuing four hostages, including Sun Dechang, the town chief of Yangxiang Town in Kunshan County. He then had a whimsical idea, demanding from Sun et al. a reward of 15 million yuan worth of cotton uniforms and over 5 million yuan in cash. At that time, Sun was unable to afford it, so he submitted a request to the paratrooper unit stationed there, asking the Paratrooper Headquarters for instructions on whether he could raise this amount locally. Commander Ma Shigong of the paratrooper unit here was furious after reading it and immediately ordered Chief of Staff Colonel Liu Nongjun to summon all relevant parties for interrogation, which took place five times. In addition to Liao Zongfu's personal confession of demanding 100 sets of cotton uniforms as rewards for the self-defense teams in Su and Dan counties, Pan Shengqiu, the town chief of Chenmu Town, also provided detailed testimony on the spot. At the same time, the Paratrooper Headquarters also discovered that Liao Zongfu had secretly hidden four confiscated short guns without reporting them. Ma considered that the district chief was greedy for merit and profit, resembling Li Defu the second, and was suspected of embezzlement. The case was serious, and if he was not brought to justice, it would be impossible to refresh social perception. Therefore, on the 30th, he ordered Su County Magistrate Lu Jianhua to strictly guard Liao Zongfu and telegraphed the Wuxi Command Post to request instructions for handling the matter.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 30th] Jiang Renjie, a senior advisor to the Taihu Bandit Suppression Command, recently received our reporter and made the following remarks on the process of the command's bandit suppression work: The command's bandit suppression work can be divided into two stages so far: the first stage was the pacification period, focusing on pacification matters on the surface. Specifically, for example, the bandit groups of Liao Bingnan, Ruan Yingjie, Hu Zhongying, Cai Haogong, Zhu Wenxiao, etc., have all been pacified and returned to allegiance. The second stage is the fundamental governance period, focusing on improving the Baojia system and strengthening local self-defense forces. The work in this stage has now been completed. In order to deeply understand the actual situation of each subordinate county, the command will send Deputy Commander Liu Hongde to lead staff, combat, and intelligence personnel to inspect Suzhou, Wujiang, Wuxi, Wujin, Yixing, Wuxing, and Changxing counties. The significance of this inspection is twofold: (1) to assess whether the Baojia system of each county is sound and whether the self-defense forces are strong; (2) because the establishment of pacification commissioners has been ordered to be withdrawn at the end of November, and there are still scattered bandits wandering in each county, the command will assess the geographical environment of each county, judge the situation, and plan to launch a thorough cleanup operation. The reporter then asked if there was indeed a third phase of the bandit suppression plan to be implemented. He replied: Although there is no clear order yet, it is quite possible, and the command has not received any news of its termination.</p>

First, the commander gave a speech, explaining that the township and Baojia heads should earnestly take responsibility and make every effort to prevent and suppress bandits, so as to eliminate them as soon as possible. He also established a three-chapter covenant: (1) Those who know about bandits but do not report, collude with bandits, harbor bandits, or compromise with bandits will be executed on the spot; (2) Those who are corrupt, leading to the oppression of good people into becoming bandits, will be executed on the spot; (3) Those who are currently serving as township and Baojia heads and who have served as enemy, puppet, or bandit township and Baojia heads in the past will be allowed to repent and reform.

<h3>Newly Appointed Zhejiang Inspector Zhu Zongliang Takes Office</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 30th] The newly appointed acting Zhejiang Inspector Zhu Zongliang, who used to be the editor of the local news section of the Shanghai Business Daily, met with our reporter alone in his capacity as a reporter on the 30th, and they had a very pleasant conversation. Zhu believes that there is still a difficult period ahead after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. During this difficult period, civil servants should have the motto of "worrying about the world before the world worries." Therefore, civil servants should absolutely not engage in business, so as to avoid blurring the lines between officials and merchants and competing with the people for profit. Bureaucratic capitalism should never exist. Zhu is scheduled to take office one day and, after internal arrangements, will spend one-third of his time each year inspecting the counties. Furthermore, Chen Songping, the chief secretary who originally acted as the inspector, will hand over his duties one day and return to Shanghai on the 2nd. He will stay in Shanghai for a while and devote himself to cultural undertakings.</p>

<h3>Local News Briefs</h3>
<p>Ningbo News: Yu Jimin, the commissioner of the 6th Administrative Region of Zhejiang Province, was initially the head of Ningbo police affairs, then the head of Yin County, and then promoted to commissioner, for a total of 16 years. At the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 26th of last month, he was transferred to a member of the Shandong Provincial Government. All sectors of Ningbo telegraphed Chairman Shen, requesting the Central Government to earnestly retain him.</p>
<p>Qingpu News: Usury is prevalent in this county. The Qingpu branch of the Provincial Agricultural Bank, in order to save rural finance, specially launched agricultural storage and loan services, surveying warehouses. All agricultural products such as rice, wheat, and rapeseed can be stored and mortgaged at a monthly interest rate of 0.9%, which is several times lower than usury.</p>
<p>Chongming News: The stone dikes connecting the ferry terminal in this county to the shore have been in disrepair for many years. In addition, last autumn, the ferry terminal workers placed a floating mine that they had dredged up on the dikes, causing a violent explosion and severe damage. The people of the township are now actively trying to repair it to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Liuhe News: The Journalists Association of this county was established on the 26th of last month. Gaoyou News: Since the restoration of this county, all levels of institutions have been restored in order. However, the health institute has repeatedly written to the Suyu Branch for relief due to limited equipment and financial difficulties. Approval has now been granted. Jiang Peiyu has been appointed as the director and is actively repairing the institute's site, which will be established soon.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to Mr. Li Zijun, manager of Ningbo Yongfeng Money Shop, who claims to be the party concerned: I read the news in the foreign news column of the Shen Bao on November 29, "All illegal money shops in Ningbo will be closed by the end of the year, totaling 71 including Yuda, etc." The name Yongfeng was listed in the news as an unapproved money shop, which is inconsistent with the facts. This shop has been approved for resumption of business by the Ministry of Finance, Jingqian No. 1087. I believe that the rumors are inaccurate. I have entrusted your lawyer to write a letter for correction, etc. Accordingly, I am writing to your newspaper to investigate and hope that you will publish it in the Letter to the Editor column to clarify the facts. Lawyer Ding Qiming of the Shen Bao</p>

<h3>Health Bureau Responds to Crackdown on Coffins</h3>
<p>Regarding the city's crackdown on coffins, various parties have repeatedly expressed their opinions in this newspaper. The letter submitted by reader Tao Ansheng, after being forwarded to the Health Bureau by this newspaper, has been answered as follows: (1) The bureau has long planned to requisition land to open up gravesites, but the number of accumulated coffins has reached more than 100,000. According to 100 graves per mu, more than 1,000 mu of land are required, and land compensation will cost at least 200 million yuan. Such a large area and such a huge sum of money make it difficult to requisition at one time. (2) Accumulated coffins can be divided into those with owners and those without owners. For coffins with owners, there is a monthly fee for coffins stored in the funeral home. The purpose of this storage is to transport them back to their place of origin for burial. Now that transportation is gradually recovering, the work of transporting coffins is actively strengthened. Is it not a one-time solution to use the monthly storage fee for transporting coffins? (3) The so-called "burial for peace" means that the body should be properly disposed of and should not be left for a long time. Cremation is originally a good method for disposing of corpses, but unfortunately this custom has not yet become widespread in our country. Those who are children are reluctant to cremate the bodies of their relatives, but how can they be at peace with letting them lie in the funeral home for years, exposed to wind and rain, and gnawed by rats and insects? If a time limit is not set and people are allowed to continue to bury them at will, who will be responsible for the epidemic that will rage in May and June next year?" It is specially published to answer Mr. Tao and to ask all families with stored coffins to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Regarding Three Student Answer Matters</h3>
<p>(1) Reply to Mr. Weng Shunfu:</p>
<p>1. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau does not have the transcript of the East Asia Institute of Technology established by the enemy.</p>
<p>2. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has agreed to hold the third qualification review next month (December). Although you have lost your transcript, you can still participate in the review if two or more of the original presidents or teachers of the East Asia Institute of Technology provide proof.</p>
<p>3. Before you pass the qualification review, you cannot apply for the second semester of the third year of public or private high schools. You can only participate in the entrance examination for the first semester of the first year of high school with equivalent academic qualifications.</p>
<p>(2) Reply to Hong Baoche and others:</p>
<p>1. Although graduates of unregistered middle schools have been admitted to universities and continue to study, their student status is still a problem.</p>
<p>2. Diplomas from unregistered middle schools cannot be regarded as proof of equivalent academic qualifications.</p>
<p>3. Since you are graduates of a certain unregistered middle school in North China, you should apply to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education for qualification review in accordance with regulations. You should also inquire directly to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education whether it will hold another qualification examination.</p>
<p>4. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has agreed to hold the third qualification review next month (December). At that time, you can bring your documents to the bureau for consultation.</p>
<p>5. Those who have been admitted to universities should still undergo qualification review, but those who were admitted before February 1946 can be given "qualification review without examination."</p>
<p>(3) Reply to Mr. Shen Yiqiu:</p>
<p>The qualification review of students from enemy and puppet colleges and universities is handled entirely by the Qualification Review Committee for Students from Enemy and Puppet Colleges and Universities established by the Ministry of Education. The committee's office is now located at National Jinan University at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Albert in Shanghai. You should go there to inquire about everything.</p>

<p>聯總援華物資　一部份不適用　　英議員指摘美商家</p>
<p>Some UN Relief Supplies for China Are Unsuitable; British MP Accuses American Businesses</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿九日電〕英下院本日開會，討論聯總之救濟工作，由工黨議員威廉士發言稱：聯總所擬接濟中國之大批物資，均未能運抵中國，且輸往中國之若干物資並不實用。若干美國商業公司，有極大嫌疑，即若輩曾將美國所不需之聯總救濟物資，以廉價傾銷於中國市塲。例如最近有婦女備用之腰帶一批運往中國，此等腰帶對紐約之太太小姐或能發生救濟效用，但對中國農婦則毫無任何用途。</p>
<p>(Agence France-Presse, London, 29th) The British House of Commons met today to discuss the relief work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). Labor MP Williams stated that a large amount of supplies that UNRRA planned to provide to China had not been shipped to China, and some of the supplies shipped to China were not practical. Several American commercial companies are highly suspected of dumping UNRRA relief supplies that were not needed in the United States into the Chinese market at low prices. For example, a batch of women's spare belts was recently shipped to China. These belts may have a relief effect on ladies in New York, but they are of no use to Chinese farmers.</p>

<p>印政府改組經過（下）  本報駐印記者周祥光</p>
<p>The Reorganization of the Indian Government (Part 2)  Our Newspaper Correspondent in India, Zhou Xiangguang</p>
<p>迄十月廿五日晚上十點鐘，始由總督作最後決定，廿六日晨，遂正式公布。綜計此次新政府改組後，計包括印度敎徒閣員四人，回敎聯盟四人，賤民階級二人，回敎國家主義者一人，錫克敎一人，拜火敎一人，及印度基督敎一人。其人數與所祖任各部姓名如下：（一）外務部卡尼赫魯，（二）內政部長巴台爾，（三）文敎部長拉却基，（四）糧農部長柏魯沙，（以上屬印度敎徒）（五）勞工部長羅糜，（六）立法部長孟德爾，（以上屬賤民階級）（七）財政部長李嘉德，（八）商業部長龔特里，（九）郵航部長尼評塔，（十）衛生部長可汗，（以上屬回敎徒）（十一）國防部長辛格，（錫克族領袖）（十二）供應部長梅德，（基督敎）、（十三）工鑛部長鮑甫（拜火敎）（十四）鐵道部長亞里，（回敎民族主義者）</p>
<p>The final decision was made by the Governor-General at 10 PM on October 25th, and the official announcement was made on the morning of the 26th. In summary, after this reorganization of the new government, it includes four Hindu cabinet members, four Muslim League members, two members of the Scheduled Castes, one Muslim nationalist, one Sikh, one Zoroastrian, and one Indian Christian. The number of people and the names of the departments they lead are as follows: (1) External Affairs Minister, Nehru; (2) Home Affairs Minister, Patel; (3) Education Minister, Rajagopalachari; (4) Food and Agriculture Minister, Prasad (all of the above are Hindus); (5) Labor Minister, Ram; (6) Law Minister, Mandal (both of the above are from the Scheduled Castes); (7) Finance Minister, Liaquat; (8) Commerce Minister, Ghazanfar; (9) Posts and Aviation Minister, Nishtar; (10) Health Minister, Khan (all of the above are Muslims); (11) Defence Minister, Singh (Sikh leader); (12) Supply Minister, Matthai (Christian); (13) Industries and Mines Minister, Bhabha (Parsi); (14) Railways Minister, Ali (Muslim nationalist).</p>
<p>綜觀上列名單，內政外交兩部操於國大黨手中，而財政商業則屬諸回盟方面；而回盟新任閣員於廿六晨赴總督府宣誓就職前，乃往眞納公館聆聽訓詞。査財長李嘉德原爲回盟執會秘書長，當眞納昔日領導十二名回敎議員於中央立法會議時，渠即追隨在旁，迄今數十年矣，故眞納特以渠爲回盟在新政府中之領袖，非無故也。</p>
<p>Looking at the above list, the Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs ministries are controlled by the Congress Party, while Finance and Commerce belong to the Muslim League. Before the new Muslim League cabinet members went to the Governor-General's residence on the morning of the 26th to be sworn in, they went to Jinnah's residence to listen to instructions. Finance Minister Liaquat was originally the Secretary-General of the Muslim League Executive Committee. When Jinnah led twelve Muslim members of the Central Legislative Assembly in the past, he followed him closely. It has been several decades since then, so it is not without reason that Jinnah specifically appointed him as the leader of the Muslim League in the new government.</p>
<p>十月廿六日上午，財長李嘉德在記者招待會中說明同盟政策，其要點如下：（一）回盟此番入閣，願與他人共同合作，和平相處，惟目前印度尙無自己之憲法，即屬於英人所製之一九三五年法律之下，故無集體負責或某人爲政府中領袖可言。（二）回盟自希望印度能獲得完全自由獨立，並爲印回兩民族權益而奮鬥；但回盟並不因此而放棄巴基斯坦之主張。（三）財政計劃並不使富者愈富，窮者愈窮，但使富者不能再富，窮者逐漸富之。因回盟自稱，在內閣中，各黨有其自己領袖，不承認尼赫魯爲政府中之領袖，並以集體負責乃憲法名詞，印度旣無憲法，故無集體負責可言；即內閣中各部自行其事，不過共時和平相處耳。</p>
<p>On the morning of October 26th, Finance Minister Liaquat explained the policies of the League at a press conference. The main points are as follows: (1) The Muslim League is willing to cooperate with others and live in peace this time it joins the cabinet, but India does not yet have its own constitution and belongs to the 1935 law made by the British, so there is no collective responsibility or someone who can be said to be the leader in the government. (2) The Muslim League hopes that India can achieve complete freedom and independence and strives for the rights and interests of both the Indian and Muslim peoples; however, the Muslim League does not give up its claim to Pakistan because of this. (3) The financial plan does not make the rich richer and the poor poorer, but makes the rich unable to get richer and the poor gradually become rich. Because the Muslim League claims that in the cabinet, each party has its own leader and does not recognize Nehru as the leader in the government, and collective responsibility is a constitutional term. Since India has no constitution, there is no collective responsibility; that is, the various departments in the cabinet do their own things, but they coexist peacefully at the same time.</p>
<p>職是之故，此次回盟參政以後，已使印度政治造成新的局勢，對國大黨之爭取自由獨立，頗有影響。過去國大黨出組新政府，總督祇是掛名首長而已，現回盟入閣，旣不贊成集體負責，又不承認誰是新政府中之領袖，則必須依照一九三五年法之規定，照印度政府組織條例，則臨時中央政府，依然是總督行政會議，使內閣地位，無形消减。國大黨一向主張共同集體負責，現旣不可能，則唯有承認此一原則。然我等第三者認爲印回兩族此次能參加政府，終爲好現象。縱使各項問題，未能達到協議，相信能設法在內閣會議席上，討論一切問題。雙方或有異見，權益或有衝突，但終須設法調整，雙方如有善意，必能逹到此項目的。如能做到此點，則可開創協商解決問題之習慣，使各集團漸趨諒解，對於主要問題，自能有愉快解決，則自由獨立之日離此不遠矣。</p>
<p>For this reason, the Muslim League's participation in politics this time has created a new situation in Indian politics and has had a considerable impact on the Congress Party's struggle for freedom and independence. In the past, when the Congress Party formed a new government, the Governor-General was only a nominal leader. Now that the Muslim League has joined the cabinet, since it does not agree with collective responsibility and does not recognize who is the leader in the new government, it must follow the provisions of the 1935 law. According to the regulations on the organization of the Indian government, the temporary central government is still the Governor-General's Executive Council, which invisibly reduces the status of the cabinet. The Congress Party has always advocated joint and collective responsibility, and now that it is impossible, it can only recognize this principle. However, we third parties believe that it is ultimately a good phenomenon that the Indian and Muslim ethnic groups can participate in the government this time. Even if agreements cannot be reached on all issues, it is believed that ways can be found to discuss all issues in the cabinet meeting. The two sides may have differences or conflicts of interest, but they must eventually find ways to adjust. If both sides have good intentions, they will surely achieve this goal. If this can be done, a habit of consultation and problem-solving can be created, so that various groups will gradually move towards understanding. For major issues, there will naturally be pleasant solutions, and the day of freedom and independence is not far away.</p>
<p>最後，尙待說明者，爲印回兩教有其不同的語言，文字，風俗，習慣，文化等，故彼此獲得一致的見解頗屬不易。國大黨方面，以國土爲立塲，希望印度統一，土地不可分割；而回盟則以民族爲立塲，希望自己民族獨立，不受他民族統治。出發點旣不同，所用方法亦異。吾人今日看印度政局演變，必明乎此，方能瞭然其根本原因所在。</p>
<p>Finally, what remains to be explained is that the Indian and Muslim religions have different languages, scripts, customs, habits, cultures, etc., so it is quite difficult for each other to reach a consensus. The Congress Party takes the territory as its standpoint, hoping that India will be unified and that the land will not be divided; while the Muslim League takes the nation as its standpoint, hoping that its own nation will be independent and not ruled by other nations. Since the starting points are different, the methods used are also different. When we look at the evolution of the Indian political situation today, we must understand this in order to understand the root cause.</p>

<p>拘禁攤販釀成軒然大波　全日紛擾交通斷絕十餘人遭槍傷　議員新聞記者在黃浦警局受毆辱</p>
<p>Detention of Street Vendors Causes a Great Disturbance; Chaos All Day, Traffic Disrupted, More Than a Dozen People Shot; Councilors and Journalists Beaten and Humiliated at Huangpu Police Station</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕警察局自奉命取締攤販後，黄浦老閘二分局，連日拘捕攤販七百餘人，黄浦分局拘押者約三百餘人，大多均已拘押歡日。昨晨因攤販家屬，紛紛要求送進食物，警局因人數過多，予以拒絕，遂生事故。在羣情情激下，星星之火，乃釀成不可收拾之勢，警察並曾朝天開槍，致流彈受傷者達十餘人。傍晚，羣衆行動漸見越軌，散布傳單，並搗毁沿途各大公司櫥窗，損失極巨。警局至深晚止，已逮捕有煽動嫌疑者百餘人。</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the police station was ordered to ban street vendors, the second branch of the Huangpu and Old Zhabei Precincts has arrested more than 700 street vendors in recent days, and the Huangpu Precinct has detained more than 300 people, most of whom have been detained for days. Yesterday morning, because the families of the street vendors demanded food be sent in, the police station refused due to the large number of people, which caused an accident. Under the emotional excitement of the crowd, a small spark turned into an uncontrollable situation. The police even fired shots into the sky, causing more than a dozen people to be injured by stray bullets. In the evening, the actions of the crowd gradually became more out of line, distributing leaflets and destroying the display windows of major companies along the way, resulting in huge losses. By late at night, the police station had arrested more than 100 people suspected of incitement.</p>
<p>昨晨八時許，黄浦分局內，被拘留三百餘攤販之家屬，紛紛要求送進食物，若干家屬並堅不肯去，必欲將此　攤販釋放。人數旣多，秩序紊亂，該分局則將彼等驅出，並令預備隊出動彈壓，各攤販家屬亦即散去。至午前十一時許，該分局奉命將拘押在內之攤販分批陸續釋放，形熱遂見緩和。不意午後十二時四十五分左右，羣衆忽又　聚，交通阻塞，情形又趨混亂。警局遂再命騎巡隊出動驅散，不意羣衆散而復聚，人數更多，請求釋放尙在拘押之攤販。詎該局警士並不向羣衆作攤販業已全部放出之解釋，而將所有圍觀之羣衆，悉作滋事之徒看待，亂加毆打，新聞記者亦不得免，被毆受傷。於是羣衆愈聚愈多，睹狀益憤通。相持至下午四時，因警察開槍强壓，附近商店，見情形嚴重，相率閉門。時黄浦分局召來救火車三輛，即將龍頭開放，企圖驅散羣衆，法商電車全部停駛，自外灘至八仙橋，首尾銜接不斷。是時情形堅張，成混亂狀態。</p>
<p>At about 8:00 yesterday morning, the families of more than 300 street vendors detained in the Huangpu Precinct demanded that food be sent in. Some families insisted on staying, determined to release the street vendors. Because there were so many people and the order was chaotic, the precinct drove them out and ordered the reserve team to suppress them, and the families of the street vendors dispersed. At about 11:00 am, the precinct was ordered to release the detained street vendors in batches, and the situation gradually eased. Unexpectedly, at around 12:45 pm, the crowd suddenly gathered again, traffic was blocked, and the situation became chaotic again. The police station then ordered the mounted patrol team to disperse them again. Unexpectedly, the crowd dispersed and gathered again, with more people, requesting the release of the street vendors still in custody. Unexpectedly, the police officers of the station did not explain to the crowd that all the street vendors had been released, but treated all the onlookers as troublemakers, beating them indiscriminately, and even journalists were not spared and were beaten and injured. As a result, more and more people gathered, and they became more and more angry at the sight. The standoff lasted until 4:00 pm. Because the police fired shots to suppress the crowd, nearby shops closed their doors one after another, seeing the seriousness of the situation. At that time, the Huangpu Precinct called three fire trucks and opened the fire hoses to try to disperse the crowd. All French-owned trams were stopped, stretching continuously from the Bund to the Eight Immortals Bridge. The situation was tense at this time, becoming a chaotic state.</p>
<p>是時市參議會代表王先靑，唐世昌，朱文德三議員，亦已趕到調解，請杜局長發全禁止警察對羣衆採取無禮行動？應盡力勸導，但當時秩序混亂，竟無能爲力，王先靑氏且受警察侮辱。五時許，市長亦至，圳與黄浦分局杜醉分局長會商，並將羣衆中已被該局逮捕者四十餘人，山市長親自訊問後，予以釋放。</p>
<p>At that time, representatives of the Municipal Council, councilors Wang Xianqing, Tang Shichang, and Zhu Wende, also rushed to mediate, asking Director Du to issue a full ban on the police taking rude actions against the crowd? They should try their best to persuade, but at that time the order was chaotic and they could do nothing. Mr. Wang Xianqing was even insulted by the police. At about 5:00, the mayor also arrived and consulted with Du Zui, the director of the Huangpu Precinct, and released more than 40 people who had been arrested by the bureau from the crowd after the mountain mayor personally interrogated them.</p>
<p>但據黄浦分局方面稱，是時該局對門之長沙商棧樓上，有人開槍，故該局警察，亦即開槍示威，五分鐘後，市長遂偕被困之各報記者離去。其後該局又捕獲行跡可疑者六十餘人。</p>
<p>However, according to the Huangpu Precinct, at that time someone fired a gun from the building of the Changsha Merchants' Stockade opposite the precinct, so the police of the precinct also fired shots to demonstrate. Five minutes later, the mayor left with the reporters from various newspapers who were trapped. After that, the precinct arrested more than 60 people with suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>沿途搗毀商店</p>
<p>Shops Destroyed Along the Way</p>
<p>下午六時，情形益緊，羣衆中似有有組織之行動，一部份羣衆阻止汽車行駛，有二人且倒臥於本報記者車前，阻止行駛者。時羣衆行動更見越軌，竟搗毀沿途公司商店櫥窗廿三處之多。中正東路，北海路，西藏路，浙江路，南京路，福州路等處商店，如紅棉酒家，大新公司，永安公司七重天，新新公司，老閘戲院，金城大戲院，新光大戲院，浙江大戲院，大春樓，履華鞋店，大中央皮鞋店，中央舞廳，廣西路一六四號，二二四號，山西路二一五號，爵祿飯店，國際大戲院，米高美舞廳，國泰越劇塲，新利査西菜社，東方食品公司，大光明眼鏡公司等，皆受破壞，估計損失不下數十億之巨。</p>
<p>At 6:00 pm, the situation became even more tense. There seemed to be organized actions among the crowd. A portion of the crowd prevented cars from driving, and two people even lay down in front of our reporter's car, preventing it from driving. At that time, the crowd's actions became even more out of line, destroying the display windows of as many as 23 companies and shops along the way. Shops on East Zhongzheng Road, North Hai Road, Tibet Road, Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road, Fuzhou Road, etc., such as Hongmian Restaurant, Great New Company, Wing On Company's Seventh Heaven, New New Company, Old Zhabei Theater, Jincheng Grand Theater, Xinguang Grand Theater, Zhejiang Grand Theater, Dachunlou, Lihua Shoe Store, Great Central Shoe Store, Central Ballroom, No. 164 Guangxi Road, No. 224, No. 215 Shanxi Road, Jue Lu Hotel, International Grand Theater, MGM Ballroom, Cathay Yue Opera House, New Rich Western Restaurant, Oriental Food Company, Daguangming Optical Company, etc., were all damaged, with estimated losses of no less than several billion.</p>
<p>下午七時，警察局副局長兪叔平氏趕到，時槍聲未止，車輛全停。自中正東路至北京路，東西交通全部斷絕。時警察在混亂中亦有被拋洋瓶磚石致傷者。</p>
<p>At 7:00 pm, Deputy Director Yu Shuping of the Police Department rushed to the scene. At that time, the gunfire had not stopped, and all vehicles were stopped. Traffic was completely cut off from east to west from East Zhongzheng Road to Beijing Road. At that time, some policemen were also injured by thrown glass bottles and bricks in the chaos.</p>
<p>老閘分局，所押攤販實較黄浦分局爲多，但因對送入食物之家屬，妥爲維持秩序，各家屬皆得列隊進入，故未生事端。其後因見羣衆搗毁該局轄境內之商店，遂亦出動維持秩序，並曾逮捕行跡可疑者三十餘人，搜出木棍鉛粉筆等物。</p>
<p>The Old Zhabei Precinct actually detained more street vendors than the Huangpu Precinct, but because the families who sent in food were properly maintained in order, all families were able to enter in line, so no incidents occurred. Later, seeing the crowd destroying shops within the jurisdiction of the bureau, they also dispatched to maintain order, and arrested more than 30 people with suspicious behavior, and found wooden sticks, lead powder pencils, etc.</p>
<p>據警局人員稱，紛亂時該局曾派員雜於州人業，密切注意，當時即曾發現有不似攤販者數人，從中指揮，羣衆感情衝動，遂皆隨聲附和，局勢遂益見嚴重。</p>
<p>According to police officers, during the chaos, the bureau sent personnel mixed in with the people to pay close attention. At that time, they discovered several people who did not look like street vendors directing from the middle. The crowd's emotions were impulsive, so they all echoed, and the situation became more and more serious.</p>
<p>鄭家木橋火光</p>
<p>Fire at Zhengjia Wood Bridge</p>
<p>又五時許槍聲緊密時，若干羣衆，曾奔至鄭家木橋口高生大紙號門口暫避，不意該號樓上忽有沸水下傾，羣衆乃益憤激，即將該號存紙全部拖至馬路，加以焚毁，該號所備之三輪車及自由車各一輛，亦爲彼等焚燒。至晚九時許，沿途雖尙有軍警警戒，秧序已漸恢復，惟高生大紙號前餘燼尙未全熄而已</p>
<p>Also, when the gunshots were tight at about 5:00, some of the crowd ran to the entrance of the Gao Sheng Da Paper Store at the mouth of Zhengjia Wood Bridge to take temporary shelter. Unexpectedly, boiling water suddenly poured down from the building of the store, and the crowd became even more angry. They dragged all the stored paper of the store to the road and burned it. The store's three-wheeled cart and bicycle were also burned by them. By about 9:00 pm, although there were still military and police guards along the way, the order had gradually been restored, but the embers in front of the Gao Sheng Da Paper Store had not been completely extinguished.</p>
<p>彈傷逹十一人</p>

<h3>Fierce Verbal Battle in the UN Political Committee; US Clarifies Stance on Disarmament; Hopes for Early Establishment of Atomic Energy Control Agreement; Various Committees Intensify Work, UN General Assembly May Conclude Within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 30th (Broadcast) - US Representative Connally delivered a speech yesterday at the UN Political and Security Committee, stating that the hope for resolving the international management of atomic energy is no longer distant. Connally stated that merely managing atomic energy cannot guarantee the implementation of disarmament, and the world must take effective action to reduce other armaments.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper's New York Correspondent, 30th] Regarding the issue of disarmament, the United Nations has once again encountered great difficulties. The Soviet Union has formally notified the United Nations that the Soviet side will never relinquish its veto power when discussing disarmament or the management of atomic energy. On the other hand, the United Kingdom and the United States have also formally declared to the United Nations their firm opposition to any single nation using its single vote to undermine the international management of disarmament.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 29th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky stated today at the Political Committee meeting, insisting that the destruction of atomic bombs be the first step towards universal disarmament among all nations, while also insisting on retaining the right to exercise veto power over any decisions regarding international control and supervision of disarmament. Vyshinsky stated, "The atomic bomb is like the sword of Damocles hanging by a thread. Only by removing this threat can we feel safe. If you have no intention of using it, why not prohibit its production? The UN mechanism must prevent the failure of universal disarmament, must abolish all weapons, and must begin by abolishing the most dangerous ones." US Representative and Senator Connally then took the floor, reiterating that the United States would not disarm unilaterally, and declared that before a global disarmament plan could be put into practice and atomic bombs declared illegal, all outstanding issues between the Soviet Union and other nations must be resolved. Connally stated that while the United States welcomes any international action regarding disarmament, the United States maintains that an agreement on the control and use of atomic energy must first be established before taking such action. Disarmament cannot be implemented effectively until a collective security system under the supervision of the UN mechanism is effectively implemented. Connally also presented a plan for universal disarmament and guarantees of implementation, containing eight measures, reiterating the US position, but without mentioning veto power. Vyshinsky once again stated frankly that the Soviet Union has no intention of abandoning veto power, even when resolving the disarmament issue. UK Chief Representative Shawcross, in a provocative tone, demanded that Vyshinsky clarify his position on veto power, reportedly stating, "We must ensure that any control is not obstructed by veto power." Vyshinsky replied, "We have no intention of abandoning the principle of unanimity (i.e., veto power), and there is no reason to change our position now. The control agencies for weapons and atomic bombs are often within the scope of the Security Council and must be subject to the full voting procedures of that council," a point Foreign Minister Molotov had already explained.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 30th] The UN structure has decided to intensify its work, working seven days a week and holding meetings as usual at night, in order to conclude all the work of the General Assembly before Christmas. Therefore, the Political Committee and the two Trusteeship Subcommittees are scheduled to close on Sunday, while other committees are also beginning to hold night meetings from today. The Secretariat has decided to instruct all committees to conclude discussions by next Friday, so that the full General Assembly can take final decisions on the proposals of each committee from December 1st, and conclude this task by December 13th. It is reported that many European representatives have already booked berths for December 14th, preparing to return home for Christmas.</p>
<h3>Review of Peace Treaty Reparation Clauses; Progress in Four Foreign Ministers Conference; Peace Treaty with Germany to Be Discussed in Europe</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 30th (Broadcast): The Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference achieved a major breakthrough today. Regarding the reparations of Italy and Bulgaria to Yugoslavia and Greece, the Soviet Union had previously insisted that Yugoslavia should receive twice as much as Greece, on the grounds that Yugoslavia suffered twice the war losses of Greece. However, in today's Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference, Molotov has abandoned this strong claim and agreed with Byrnes's proposal that the reparations received by the two countries should be equal, but there is still no agreement on the total amount of reparations from Italy and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] The "Daily Telegraph" diplomatic correspondent reports: Since Prime Minister Bevin returned from the United States, Britain may establish a resident envoy in Germany. Once the peace treaty with Germany's associated countries is established, the peace treaty with Germany itself may be discussed in Europe.</p>
<h3>Trusteeship Subcommittee Rejects; South Africa's Annexation of Southwest Africa</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 29th] The Trusteeship Committee of the UN's Subcommittee rejected today the proposal by the Union of South Africa to annex its mandated territory of Southwest Africa, but at the same time decided to leave the door open for future discussions. The latter vote was based on a joint proposal by the United States and Denmark, namely that the current General Assembly should not take action on the issue of Southwest Africa's annexation by South Africa. The US-Danish proposal, after being passed by the Subcommittee today, will be submitted to the Trusteeship Committee for consideration.</p>
<h3>Siam Withdraws Lawsuit Against France from the United Nations</h3>
<p>France Endorses Siam's Membership Application</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie announced today two letters, one from the Siamese delegation to the United States, withdrawing the country's lawsuit against France from the Security Council, and the other from the French representative, supporting Siam's application to join the United Nations as a member state.</p>
<h3>Food Relief Plan; Has Received Soviet Support</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 29th] The $400 million food relief plan proposed by UNRRA Director La Guardia has received Soviet support, as stated by its representative Gromyko in a speech at the UN Economic and Financial Committee today. Gromyko said that the Soviet Union, which suffered greatly from the war damage inflicted by the enemy, will contribute a small portion of its burden to the organization. Gromyko also made it clear that the food and economic fund supported by the Soviet Union must be managed in accordance with the same international principles as the UNRRA organization.</p>
<h3>Merger of British and American Zones in Germany; Negotiations May Be Completed Next Week</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] This radio station announced: Deputy Secretary of State Acheson announced that negotiations on the merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany may be concluded next week.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] After the completion of the British-American negotiations on the merger of the two occupation zones in Germany, the entire administrative issue of the British zone in Germany will be reviewed. Britain has now agreed in principle to share with the United States the cost of 250 million pounds every three years for the two zones, but after the merger of the two zones, the proportion of US dollars to British pounds in trade will change, meaning that more goods will be purchased from non-dollar zones in the future.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] Rumors that the British and American governments are pressuring the French government to agree to the merger of the three occupation zones within Germany could not be confirmed here.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops in the German Occupation Zone; Begin Large-Scale Withdrawal; This is a Sign of Major Changes in Soviet Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] This newspaper published a dispatch from Berlin quoting Soviet staff officers as saying that Soviet troops have withdrawn on a large scale from eastern Germany. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: This is "very likely" and pointed out that Stalin answered the inquiry of the President of the United Press on October 28, stating that the Soviet troops of sixty divisions in Eastern Europe will be reduced to forty divisions within two months. It is said that this withdrawal is in compliance with the recent demobilization order issued by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 29th] The large-scale withdrawal of Soviet troops from the German occupation zone shows that there has been a major change in Soviet policy to align with the US and British policies. The news of the Soviet troop withdrawal was released by the US Deputy Governor Keating and the German side. According to Keating, part of the Soviet troops has begun to withdraw to their country, which is in line with the guarantee recently provided by the Soviet authorities at the Four-Power Control Council. German officials said that the Soviet occupation zone will be divided into five states, each with a legislative body and an administrative body, which is the same as the US and British occupation zones. The Soviet policy originally intended to establish a centralized government in its German occupation zone, which shows that its attitude has changed. This new Soviet policy may be modeled on the US Secretary of State's proposal to implement a federal system in Germany, with the states and the Four-Power Control Council sharing its ruling power. There is no definite information on the number of Soviet troops withdrawn. The London Daily Mail said that about 300,000 Soviet troops have been withdrawn this time. US military intelligence personnel reported that "Soviet troops in Berlin have not shown any signs of decreasing. If the Soviet troops are really withdrawing on a large scale, they will definitely trumpet it to promote their disarmament proposals at the UN General Assembly."</p>
<h3>December 2nd Designated as; US "Atomic Energy Day"</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] The United States has decided to designate December 2nd as "Atomic Energy Day" to commemorate the invention of the atomic bomb. At that time, the Oak Ridge atomic bomb factory in Tennessee, the Chicago manufacturing plant, and the Alamos atomic experiment site in New Mexico will all hold commemorative ceremonies. According to the US atomic bomb manufacturing plan, the so-called "Manhattan Project," was formulated on December 4th, and all subsequent atomic bomb experiment plans originated from this.</p>
<h3>Near East Anti-Communist Conference; Will Be Held in Baghdad at the End of This Year; Iraq Declares Good Neighbor Policy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Beirut, 30th] According to the "Oriental Daily," Turkey, Egypt, and Iraq are scheduled to hold an anti-communist conference in Baghdad at the end of this December to discuss ways to resist communism in the Near East and the Middle East. It is said that representatives from other Arab countries have been invited to participate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Baghdad, 29th] Iraqi Prime Minister Said told Reuters reporters today that it is untrue that I intend to organize Greater Syria. I only know to work for a free and strong Arab world. I also hold the same attitude towards plans for close cooperation with foreign countries. Said also stated that I have never signed a military agreement with Turkey on behalf of Iraq. Turkey and Iran are both our neighbors, and we should maintain good neighborly relations.</p>
<h3>Reddening of Europe; Stalin Has Ambitions</h3>
<p>Impressions of a US Newspaper Publisher Traveling in Europe</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 29th] Newspaper publisher Gannett, who has just returned to the United States after traveling in Europe, said in a speech: He believes that Stalin has ambitions to redden Europe, "In the future, if Stalin wants to march into Europe, he will not encounter much resistance."</p>
<h3>Slavic Congress; Will Be Held in the Southern Capital</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 29th] It has been learned that the Soviet delegation to the Slavic National Congress has set off today for Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. Wellington Koo and Zhang Qun paid a visit to the US President on October 29th, and the photo was taken when they left the White House (US Information Service).</p>
<h3>United Nations Decides; to Ban Opium; Our Delegation Expresses Gratitude</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 29th] The UN Narcotics Control Committee recommended today that all member states ban the sale of opium for smoking, and the Chinese representative welcomed the passage of this bill. The Chinese delegation strongly argued that the facts of mutual blame among countries in the past regarding the opium issue must be forgotten. This refers to the story of the large-scale import of opium into China many years ago, but it is only for reference. The resolution recommends taking various steps to prohibit the production, domestic transportation, and use of opium.</p>
<h3>Greek Guerrilla Warfare in Northern Greece; Extends to the Turkish Border</h3>
<p>Greek Prime Minister Decides to Go to New York</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] London, 30th (Broadcast): The Greek cabinet held a meeting today and decided that Prime Minister Tsaldaris will immediately go to New York to report the border conflict incident to the Security Council. It is expected that he will also insist on Greece's border demands on Albania and Bulgaria at the Four Powers Conference, and may also request relief loans from the US government for use when the UN stops providing aid.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 30th] It was reported here today: The guerrilla warfare in northern Greece has expanded to the Turkish border. Guerrillas and government forces have been in fierce conflict for a long time, with a total of ninety-two people killed. It is reported that the conflict took place in the Soufli region on the Greek-Turkish border, 180 miles northeast of Thessaloniki and only 130 miles from Istanbul.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reparations Plan; Largely Approved by Britain; US is Negotiating with Relevant Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 30th] The new plan proposed by US Reparations Commissioner Pauley completely prohibits Japan from having aluminum and magnesium industries. The annual steel production is limited to 2.75 million tons, and all production of copper and nickel is for reparations. Japan's machine tool inventory should be reduced to 175,000 sets, and subsequent annual production is limited to 1,000 sets. Ships are limited to 5,000 tons per ship, and the total tonnage must not exceed 1.5 million tons. Its 114 ships, totaling 869,000 tons, will be used for reparations. The annual production of train locomotives is limited to 22 sets, passenger cars to 800, and freight cars to 4,800. Its 970 train locomotives and 30,000 freight cars will be used for reparations. The chemical industry is limited to meeting its own needs. The fishing, textile, and ceramics industries are not interfered with. It is reported that Britain has largely approved this plan, but the Soviet Union has not yet indicated its approval.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the United States has begun discussing the distribution of Japanese reparations with the other ten countries. This matter is being consulted by the State Department with the countries concerned individually, and it is hoped that a solution can be obtained soon. Acheson also said that the United States hopes that the countries concerned will jointly assist in drafting instructions to be issued to MacArthur for execution, so that the new proposals of Reparations Commissioner Pauley, such as the Japanese arsenals and industrial equipment used for reparations, will be distributed in advance by 15 to 20 percent. The State Department is reviewing Pauley's report in detail. Other government officials also said that the Soviet Union would firmly refuse to participate in the reparations distribution meeting, but the United States still intends to consult with it.</p>

<h3>Qingbai Wins Over Jewish Team by Five Goals</h3>
<p>McNitty's Poor Performance Causes Underdog to Lay an Egg</p>
<p>In the football league's first division, Qingbai and the Jewish team battled at the Yiyuan Stadium yesterday afternoon, with over two thousand spectators. The Jewish team was late, and the match started at 2:40 pm. As a result, Qingbai won by a large margin of five to zero, with a score of three to zero in the first half.</p>
<p>Opening the Record in One Minute</p>
<p>Qingbai kicked off, passing the ball back and forth. Song Lingsheng headed Xue Weitai's hook shot, and Lingzai rushed up to nudge the ball. The ball bounced off the goalpost and was kicked into the net by McNitty, just one minute after the start of the match. Three minutes later, Luo Shoufu headed the ball over, Zhang Renyi hooked and shot, McNitty miscalculated, and the ball fell into the right corner of the net, two to zero. The Jewish team counterattacked, but to no avail. At 23 minutes, Song Lingzai advanced in the middle, Bao Zheng received the ball and went deep. McNitty rushed out and collided with Xiao Gao, both falling to the ground, while the ball flew into the empty goal, three to zero. After that, it was still Qingbai's world, but Xue Weitai and Meng Yiliang's two shots were saved by McNitty lying on the ground. Before long, the first half ended, with Qingbai leading by three goals.</p>
<p>Jewish Team Attacks but Fails</p>
<p>After switching sides, the battle resumed, and the Jewish team's offense was very strong. Qingbai's penalty area was crisscrossed by iron cavalry, but in the end, due to the Jewish team's scattered forwards and bad luck, they often fell short and achieved nothing. After fifteen minutes, Luo Choufu went deep into the hinterland alone and swept the ball in from the left corner, scoring again, four to zero. Ten minutes later, Mo Lingsheng's shot was blocked. McNitty saved the ball away from the goal, but Bao Zheng happened to be there and kicked it into the net, ending the match at five to zero.</p>

<h3>Black and White Team's Farewell Performance; Men's and Women's Teams Both Won Last Night; The Whole Team is Scheduled to Return South in Batches Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Philippine Overseas Chinese Black and White Basketball Team's expedition to Shanghai has been completely completed last night. In the last two charity matches last night, the men's and women's teams were pleased to win both, which can be regarded as a commemorative gift to bid farewell to the team. The women's team first defeated the Green team 25 to 16, using men's rules, to avenge the humiliation of the defeat the day before. The score was twelve to twelve in the first half, and the Green team was still able to fight in the first half, but they were exhausted in the second half and finally lost. The men's team, Black and White, came from behind to defeat the US military Maclins Helena team, fifty to forty-two. The score was twenty-one to twenty-six in the first half, with Black and White behind. It was estimated that there were thousands of spectators last night. Before the game, Wu Shaoshu, the vice president of the Sports Association, presented the Black and White men's and women's teams with a banner each. At halftime of the men's game, Shao Rugan, the director-general of the Sports Association, presented the Black and White team with a large silver cup on behalf of the Basketball Committee as a memorial, which was accepted by Zhuang Yuxi amidst the sound of drums.

In addition, the two million yuan honorary tickets sold by the Shanghai branch of the Overseas Chinese Federation will be announced tomorrow.</p>
<p>Black and White Women Win Against Green Team</p>
<p>Black and White Takes the Lead and Ties the Score</p>
<p>At 6:30, the Black and White Green team women's match began. Black and White played with Huang Rulan, Chen Yurun, Ye Yiqing, Xiao Fanleng, and Wu Yuwu, while the Green team was Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, Chen Huanzhi, Wang Weizhen, and Liu Zhenbao. Xiao Fanleng was first fouled into the basket, and Rulan added a throw, and Black and White took the lead with four to zero. The Green team, Mingyuan, was penalized once, and Yurun also scored one point. The Green team called a timeout and saw an instant improvement, scoring seven consecutive points. Black and White quickly replaced Ye Yiqing with Lu Shuhui. At the end of the first quarter, the Green team came from behind with eight to six. In the second quarter, Yang Xiuzhi replaced Xiao Fanleng, and after ten to six, Huang Rulan scored four consecutive points with throws and penalties. Rong Shujian also made a contribution, and Yurun shot in, ending the first half. Each scored twelve, and the colors were evenly divided.</p>
<p>Green Team's Female Generals Show Fatigue The difficult and indistinguishable battle situation in the first half could not be maintained by the Green team in the second half. In the first quarter, Black and White scored nine consecutive points, and the Green team only scored two points, and the fate was determined. The Green team first brought in Liu Zhenbao, Wang Weizhen, Ren Meiyi, Wu Ailian, Lu Shuhui made a wonderful shot, and Wu Yuwu shot in. The Green team called a timeout, and Liu Zhenbao and Wang Zazhen returned to the field. When Green Team Zhenbao broke the basket, the third quarter ended, with the Green team trailing by fourteen to twenty-one. In the last quarter, the Green team worked hard to strengthen, but the Black and White defense was tight. The Green team's female generals were already tired after the fierce battle. Wu Yuwu and Ru each scored one goal. The Green team was re-scored by Yao Zhenbao, and the result was twenty-five to sixteen, Black and White won.</p>
<p>Men's Team Wins Helun</p>
<p>The Helena Team Thrives First and Then Declines</p>
<p>In the final match, the Black and White men's team competed against the US Marine Corps Helena. Foreigner Pison was the first to score and break the record, and Oscuro added a touch, while Black and White only scored one point with a penalty from Lin Ziyi. In the first quarter, Helena scored fifteen points, while Black and White only scored four points. In the second quarter, Black and White showed some improvement. Zhuang Yuxi made a long shot, and Xu Yinzhen made a close shot, both scoring, and the morale was boosted. The score gradually narrowed, and the first half ended, with Black and White trailing by twenty-one to twenty-six.</p>
<p>Working Harder, Black and White Wins</p>
<p>In the second half, the contact was resumed, and Black and White replaced Xu Yinzhen with Shi Ronglu. At thirty-one to twenty-three, Black and White replaced Xu Yinzhen with Li Jinzao. Shen Renshou made a shot from the baseline, and Li Jinzao added a touch. Black and White finally tied the score. Zhuang Yuxi was like a god, with left and right opportunities, and in an instant, Black and White took the lead with thirty-five to thirty-one. The third quarter ended. In the last ten minutes, the battle situation became more tense. Before long, Zhuang Yuxi was disqualified for five fouls, and Walkerhi replaced him on the field. Renshou was like entering an uninhabited area, with two throws and one penalty, leading with forty-four to thirty-eight. When time was up, Black and White won fifty to forty-two.</p>

<h3>Watching "The Outlaw Heroes"</h3>
<p>— Ding Zhi</p>
<p>I feel that with the manpower and material resources, plus the screenwriter and director, the work that satisfied me in the past was "Wen Tianxiang," and currently it's "The Outlaw Heroes."</p>
<p>The screenwriter's selection of material and the clarity of the theme are flawless.</p>
<p>The directing can be described as concise and clear. Every scene's movement resembles film shots on the silver screen, giving a sense of "beauty." Especially several crowd scenes are neither piled together nor chaotic, but rather arranged in an orderly manner, forming beautiful and majestic images. I think the director must be Mr. Hong, otherwise the actors would not be so obedient.</p>
<p>The set design is quite original, and the lighting also cooperates effectively, which further enhances the performance.</p>
<p>The actors, including Ye Gao, Xia Tian, Wang Ping, Feng ?, Lan Ma, Jun Wei, Gao Yang, Shi Jingshan, Shen Yang, Chen Jing, etc., play various key roles in the play. The compactness of the performance increases people's interest. I am by no means an idol worshiper, but a good script must have experienced actors to make it a resounding success.</p>
<p>What's even more commendable are the so-called extras inside. Some say one or two lines, and some don't speak at all, but they all stick to their roles, helping to enhance the performance without being frivolous or taking advantage. They act in a serious manner. I can say that this is the first time I've seen this since watching stage plays. If every performance could have such a cooperative spirit, stage plays would not be difficult to flourish.</p>
<p>Among the actors, I particularly like Wang Ping. In the play, she plays the elder sister-in-law, a good helper to her husband, and a shrewd and capable housewife. From the dialogue of the characters on stage, the outline of the elder sister-in-law is introduced in this way, and later Wang Ping's performance brings her to life. A spectator sitting behind me exclaimed, "It's really too good!" Of course, he was also referring to Wang Ping's acting skills. It's a pity that I'm not familiar with Miss Wang Ping and don't know if Miss Wang's personality is also like this in private. If not, but she can portray the character of the character so clearly and grasp it so steadily, it is indeed admirable. If the play is well acted, people will naturally appreciate it, and there is really no need to use any "famous actress" to promote it.</p>
<p>Next is Xia Tian. He plays an antagonist, a spy type. Originally, when performing this type of role, the actor often likes to emphasize his shortcomings, making people feel "over the top." Xia Tian's performance is just right, which is not easy.</p>
<p>Lan Ma's acting has always been steady. Indeed, many characters with status in the play need Lan Ma to play them in order to highlight how important the character's position is. Someone once asked me, "Is Shi Hui good? Or is Lan Ma good?" I said, "Each has his own path, both are good." Tonight, seeing Lan Ma's demeanor on stage reminded me of a metaphor. I think Shi Hui is like the Peking opera actor Qilin Tong, while Lan Ma is like Gai Jiaotian. Especially tonight, his posture is quite like Gai Jiaotian singing Lu Junyi in "Da Ming Fu." Moreover, in my opinion, his facial makeup is almost indistinguishable from the real person.</p>
<p>Shen Yang's pronunciation is clear and his voice is loud, which are his good assets. I have seen him in several plays, playing different roles, and he can give people different impressions. He is truly a lovable actor.</p>
<p>Wei Wei is better than the several plays she has performed in the past. I think it must be because she likes the personality of the third sister this time, or it matches her.</p>
<p>All the other actors worked hard and were very responsible. It was truly satisfying to watch.</p>
<p>At the end, I seemed to feel that something was missing, and the eldest brother's rushing out seemed to be deliberately feeding himself to the bullets. Similarly, the fifth brother went out and was fine, it seems that the eldest brother's death was a bit forced.</p>
<p>Honestly, this "Outlaw Heroes" is a real work of art, and can also be said to be a "representative of spoken drama."</p>
<p>Secondly, if the time for changing scenes can be sped up a bit, I believe it will definitely bring back the lost audience.</p>
<p>Also, in the second scene of the second act, the actors of the heroes from all walks of life are students from the Municipal Experimental Drama School. After watching it, it is regrettable that they are all a group of drama enthusiasts. Now that the school has been revoked, it is like a group of orphans without support. I wonder if the school will think of a way for them? Otherwise, the professors should also introduce them to a way to continue learning drama.</p>
<h3>"Meng Jiangnu" Opera Adaptation</h3>
<p>— Song Qingwan</p>
<p>The Chinese Dance Drama Co.'s opera "Meng Jiangnu" is coming to Nanjing this time, and friends in the music and drama circles certainly can't miss this opportunity. Even though the tickets are so expensive, they can't help but sacrifice a bit. And the result obtained was disappointment.</p>
<p>When opera does not have a clear path in China, no one can say for sure how opera in this country should be approached. In "Meng Jiangnu," Chinese old opera actors are paired with a Western orchestra. Chinese opera stage steps are used, plus Western modern dance. Ancient Chinese costumes are worn, and Impressionist scenery is used as a background... This kind of performance, which is chaotic and nondescript, does not even achieve the most basic "unity."</p>
<p>The leader and composer of the opera is an old Russian man, Avshalomoff. Musically, except for the flute playing a bit of an oriental flavor in the "December Meng Jiangnu" tune, everything else can be said to be Western symphonic music. Mr. Avshalomoff's ideals for Chinese opera are quite right. He said: "Chinese musical drama is richer than Western art, especially folk art is full of unrestrained emotions. Turning literature into opera is very ideal." But Mr. Avshalomoff's performance is quite the opposite. In this opera, we did not see any characteristics that could represent Chinese opera.</p>
<p>Mr. Avshalomoff has a good understanding of Wagner, the pioneer of musical drama. He wants to use Chinese medicinal materials and his own imagination and skills to create Chinese-style works of art. There are many types of old Chinese drama, and it is difficult for not only Mr. Avshalomoff, but also the Chinese themselves, to understand them clearly. The more experienced friends in Nanjing did not quite agree with this performance.</p>
<p>It is admirable that a foreign friend puts in such effort for Chinese opera. What we hope is that he can study it more thoroughly, because the opera "Meng Jiangnu" is to represent Chinese opera abroad, and it can also be said to introduce Chinese art abroad. If Chinese opera is like this, I am afraid there will be problems.</p>
<h3>A Shot from "Reeds Turn White, Swallows Fly"</h3>
<h3>About Chen Baichen</h3>
<p>— Zhou Si, written in Suzhou</p>
<p>Previously, in this publication, Mr. Na Ya listed four of our country's playwrights and introduced and reviewed them separately, which is a good reference for readers who love drama. But I think it is worthwhile to re-examine the parts about Cao Yu and Chen Baichen.</p>
<p>In Cao Yu's early works, there is indeed a hint of characters being dominated by fate, especially in "Thunderstorm"; but it is not necessarily "fatalism."</p>
<p>Chen Baichen is a master of comedy, and "Promotion Chart" is even more aimed at reality. The author once said that he wrote "Promotion Chart" in order to conduct an examination. We also cannot deny that there is no shadow of this group of people in the current society. Mr. Na Ya said: "The officials in 'Promotion Chart' seem a bit too exaggerated. The officials say whatever they want. They forgot about the rights of the people." Yes, when a real person is cartoonized and portrayed as a character in a comedy, it is inevitable that there will be some exaggeration. However, it is precisely because of this exaggeration that we can more clearly recognize these people. And for those living in the occupied areas, they can even more know the truth of a group in The New Official Takes Office.</p>
<p>Another point is that the editor of Phoenix City is Wu Zuguang, not Yuan Jun.</p>
<h3>"Resurrection"</h3>
<p>— Tang Ke</p>
<p>Recently, " " has put Tolstoy's "Resurrection" on the Yue opera stage, which cannot be said to be anything but glory for the Yue opera circle.</p>
<p>"Resurrection" has been adapted into a stage play. Domestically, it has been adapted successively by the senior drama figures Tian Han and Xia Yan. Tian Han's adaptation focuses on the land issue, while Xia Yan's adaptation expresses the male protagonist Nekhlyudov's psychological process of repentance after committing a crime against the female protagonist Katyusha, and also reflects the shamelessness of the aristocratic society at that time. Although their adaptation intentions are different, their reverence for Tolstoy's humanism is not.</p>
<p>I don't know where their adaptation points are. If they only see the twists and turns of its story structure, or extract Nekhlyudov and Katyusha's tender feelings and tragic romance, then adapting it will not only fail to convey Tolstoy's spirit, but also ignore the original work's profound educational significance. This speculation is based on my viewing of the story of the talented scholars and beautiful women's joys and sorrows in "Phoenix Lovesickness." Therefore, when "Resurrection" is adapted into Yue opera, it must not be biased towards the "ambiguous" relationship between Nekhlyudov and Katyusha, and should instead focus on respecting Tolstoy's original spirit.</p>
<p>Since the correctness of the theme has been determined, the work cannot be adapted into a Chinese work by changing the national conditions. In fact, China is still China, and Russia is still Russia. Chinese customs must not be infiltrated into Russian life. Otherwise, we will see Russians with Chinese thoughts and feelings on the Yue opera stage.</p>
<p>I hope that this Yue opera troupe, which is praised by people, can break out of the old nest in this adaptation and stand on a new and true artistic position!</p>
<p>The International Film Festival held in Cannes, on the southern Mediterranean coast of France, in October 1946, had a magnificent atmosphere and was a sensation at the time. A total of 155 films in fourteen languages were shown successively. The types can be roughly divided into three categories. The first type is pieced together from plots, such as plays, that is, the shadow plays we are used to, which can also be called drama movies. The second type captures real scenes and adds artistry, called "cultural film", also known as "film archives". The third type is delicate painting of comics, which can be called "animated slides". As a rule, each competition's product must have at least one shadow play and one film archive. The third item is an optional category. The United States is still the best in this, from their first inventor Walt Disnay, When competition results, The awards category has only one big award, the other twenty four award is national, Their products won a international award, first is France, this is war archive, named guerilla in back stage. the second place is Russia, this is color sport film archive, there are 25000 men and women youth in Moscow city Red place. Hidden indicate the national power, A good plan for overseas advertising. The name is My Country Youth. The last Every Country</p>
<h3>French Cannes Film Competition</h3>
<p>— Hong Fu</p>
<p>has the opportunity to win the national award for the best product. The winner of the blood account representing a country. The American award is "Unnecessary Weekend". The French Award is "Ensemble of Rural Beauty". The Italian award for film archive masterpiece is "Unfortified Rome". The Dutch Award is the famine that records the facts of 1944 and 1945. The Russian Award is called "Sharp Turn Down". The Danish Award is called "Blood Land". The British Award is called "A short trip". The Indian Award is "Down Town" describing the workers' area. Others such as Czech, Mexican, Swedish and Swiss works, the best have awards. Only Switzerland has the last chance to win the national award." A film category simultaneously received the International Peace Prize for its efforts to promote peace. Looking at the award-giving standards, it seems that emphasis is still placed on patriotic actions and war. This comes from the judgment of the judges, which is slightly different from the general audience's intentions. The audience has shown boredom with the old articles such as the dangerous aspects of war and the secret resistance of patriotic youths during the war. If the connoisseur goes one step further and pays attention to the psychological test of the masses, then the best performance of the pre-competition product from beginning to end is the American comedian, Kay Yiyi's performance of "Strange Man". As a result, the whole audience laughed for more than fifty minutes. It is a pity that he did not win the award. It is sad that there are so many uncoordinated things in the world, and everything can be viewed in this way.</p>
<h3>Rambling About New Films</h3>
<p>— Ma Boliang</p>
<p>Christmas</p>
<p>A holiday piled up with fire trees and silver flowers, joy inevitably hides the old dreams of sorrow, a wild goose's footprints in life. Mo Han wrote this idea into "Christmas". A Londoner got tired of playing cards and went to Paris to find stimulation. A prostitute's miserable statement made the person lose interest and quietly return to his card table to settle down. The film adaptation is quite different from the original work. The role of the lieutenant is temporarily added for national conditions, which becomes a snake's feet and loses the original work's meaning of life. Director Robert Siodmak seems to be French. His works "The Killers" and "Criss Cross" both show distinctiveness. This film's handling is meticulous and clear in terms of cumbersome details, especially the arrangement of tense situations, which is ingenious and concise. Tells us that he is indeed a first-class director of mystery films. But because of this, he did not understand the meaning of this poorly adapted script, and therefore could not express the power of this tragedy. The beginning and ending feel very vulgar. I think the ending shot can use Diana Durbin's eyes to push the camera all the way forward into the heroine's eyes, a big close-up, let the eyes become a black ocean, vast, a drop of white shaking tear, flowing down, magnified, with the word END appearing on it, symbolizing this woman's life of swallowing her voice and enduring tears. This may be a small supplement to this simple film.</p>
<p>Blood Tears in the Sea of Love</p>
<p>Restoring primitive love is the greatest hope of city dwellers. Naked bathing in the deep sea, living in caves as mandarin ducks, naked and happy life. The male protagonist in "Flame of Fury" therefore returns to the embrace of the South China Sea. Li Quoque in "Blood Tears in the Sea of Love" leaves the romance of Spanish Gypsies and returns to the civilized world of England, letting the passionate Gypsy dancer die for love, letting a pair of childhood sweethearts go through hardships and regain their old love. This is the British national sense of excellence, the Londoner's romantic fantasy. "Blood Tears in the Sea of Love" is an extremely romantic Melocrama, love, jealousy, conspiracy, trap, murder, fate, reunion, suicide, death... It is exactly the complete element of Melodrama. This film is also typically British in style, long and tortuous, with a very full flavor. The director's technique is fierce and powerful, the burial in quicksand, the enchanting demon's dance, the impression is profound. The male protagonist Stewart Granger is both civil and military, and the female protagonist Jean Kent's beauty and art are also not ordinary even in Hollywood. Anne Crawford's bearing is indeed noble, but I always prefer the passionate beauty of the Gypsy.</p>
<p>A Talented Man and a Beautiful Woman</p>
<p>Writers should not dream, this kind of story is just material on the screen, making the fake real, it is still a play, a comedy with a plot that does not fall into the cliché, even if some old jokes are used, it can still cause laughter. After "Bringing Up Baby", "The Ghost Goes West", "The Amazing Mr. Smith", "Here Comes Mr. Jordan", "The Gay Divorcee", and "That Uncertain Feeling", "It Happened One Night", "Canary Row" and this "A Talented Man and a Beautiful Woman" are the comedies that I am most satisfied with. From the beginning of the subtitles to the end when the professors bring it to an end, it is really full of jokes. Seven old fools plus a silly young linguist, learning the local language, recognizing the wrong father-in-law, temporarily learning boxing, and still being serious, as if it were true. It is rare for a bookworm to fall in love without causing people to laugh. Director Howard Hawks' scheduling is very smooth, and the hubs of each humorous occasion are also well connected. Mylee Cooper and Blanche Stanley are getting better and better as they get older. Gary Cooper's style of a rough man has long become a school. Blanche's entire body is always full of drama. Her section of undressing and waving her thighs is dazzling. No wonder the old maid said that she was the kind of woman who destroyed all civilization. It is a pity that the clothes she wears do not show off her figure, but fortunately, after her bangs are rolled up, she still looks like a young woman, and it can be said that her appearance is as beautiful as a flower.</p>
<p>Meet Me in St. Louis</p>
<p>Looking back, it is the good old days of forty years ago, existing in the colorful New Year's cards, reappearing before our eyes, a piece of sunshine, a piece of snowflake, a piece of fallen leaf, the whispers of first love, the prom of youth, the melodious sound of the car bell, the quiet starry night, all are so kind. I really like the family in St. Louis, Missouri. A bright piano sound and a gentle singing voice, a house full of men, women, old and young, close and warm, a harmonious atmosphere, each person has a forever shining orange year, like the shining time in my own past life. I don't like the vulgar singing and dancing of ordinary song and dance films, but I love "Meet Me in St. Louis", the lovable actors' laughter, and the simple and sincere singing and dancing: "Meet Me in St. Louis", "I'm in Love with the Boy Next Door", "I'll Get By". The clusters of flowers in the streetcar are an adult's fairy tale world. The lit living-room after the show makes me want to watch "Meet Me in St. Louis" again, looking for a hazy past, a warm life.</p>

<h3>Emotions</h3>
<p>— Jing Shan</p>
<p>The famous Bulgarian writer Ivan Vazov once wrote a short story about a small theater. The plot is very simple. The general idea is that in the city where all the theaters are full every day, there is a small theater that no one goes to visit; because there are too few spectators, it has to stop performing and refund the money to the only few spectators. This is already the ×th night. The owner of the place is busy arranging everything, preparing to start the performance, but when the time comes, there are only a sparse four or five viewers on the seat. So a minute, a quarter of an hour, and an hour pass, there are absolutely no new viewers, and the people on the seats gradually become listless. Finally, the curtain opens, but it is the owner of the place who comes out, and he mournfully announces that the evening's performance has to be cancelled, and asks everyone to go to the door to get a refund.</p>
<p>The story is simple, and the author has not used any surprising techniques, but this short story gives me a very deep impression. The only reason, I think, is that the emotions contained in that short story are too touching.</p>
<p>Originally, the essence of art is the connection of human emotions. Emotion is a base force (borrowing Freud's term). This base force uncontrollably wants to find a way to vent, and the creation of art is one of them.</p>
<p>For example, many folk mountain songs are works of mature emotion. Compared with certain coy new poems or essays, the former's degree of touching is superior to the latter's. Also, for example, a "ordinary novel" with mature emotions can be more touching than a work with a bizarre and tortuous plot and novel writing techniques. Because a fictional work that has not been mixed with the author's emotions is like a soulless body. How can this arouse the reader's resonance? It also fundamentally goes against the essence of art.</p>
<p>Therefore, for a great work, in addition to content and skills, what is indispensable is emotion; otherwise, it can only be called the story of a "story craftsman" or the propaganda text of a propagandist.</p>
<p>But let's try the current literary and artistic works. Just take novels as an example, there are quite a lot of them, especially literary journals, which seem to be incomplete if they don't publish one or two novels. But what about their content? Eighty or ninety percent of them are just stories with empty shells. What's the point of that? What's a pity is what those "non-practitioners" write. Because before they step into the stage of "non-practitioners", in addition to the mastery of skills, they must have also had a very good nurturing of emotions, but now they only focus on the development of skills. Isn't this very regrettable?</p>
<p>Let us repeat again: "The essence of art is the connection of humans, emotions." What violates this essence can only provide amusement or enjoyment for certain people, but can never be called complete art.</p>
<h3>Seeking Friendly Voices: On Literary Tea Parties</h3>
<p>(1) Zong Lu</p>
<p>A gathering like a literary tea party is something I personally felt a great need for as soon as I arrived in Shanghai. This city of extravagant pleasures rarely has good places for humble cultural people like us. Moreover, after eight years of war, old friends are scattered. Even friends who are currently in Shanghai together rarely have the opportunity to chat. Economic hardship further affects the connection of friendships. Therefore, such a gathering can also be said to meet a general need. If participants can embrace a pure and sincere enthusiasm to establish new friendships, future expansion can be predicted.</p>
<p>The nature of the tea party can certainly be limited to the two topics of leisure after work and connecting emotions. However, it wouldn't hurt to pay a little attention to literary discussions to promote the atmosphere and encourage each other. For example, today most of us came from the Qi Baishi painting exhibition. It wouldn't hurt to express our feelings and criticisms about Qi's art, or to discuss creative issues based on the works in publications such as "Chunqiu" and "Wen Chao." This will not only provide young participants with rich and satisfying gains but also fill the tea party itself with unlimited vitality. The position and viewpoint of the reviews are completely free, without establishing any sects. Everyone should be true to the original intention of art and strive for further progress together. It is hoped that the literary tea party will not fall into the criticism of being "idle" but will have real content. Secondly, participants can also raise any questions on literature and art and ask a writer to express opinions and answers.</p>
<p>(2) Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Last Sunday afternoon, I went to the Chess and Wine House on the fifth floor of the Great New Company for the first time to participate in the fourth literary tea party. Now I have some small opinions to offer to the members for reference:</p>
<p>(1) That day, four or five families were getting married in the wine house on the fifth floor. Guests were crowded, and music was playing noisily, which was extremely noisy. I think literary tea parties should find a quieter and more elegant place, where we can taste tea, talk quietly, and express our heartfelt feelings. This will not only match the name with the reality but also allow people who are busy and tired all day to have half a day of leisure, temporarily putting aside national affairs, social unrest, economic oppression, and family trivial matters. Let's talk about wonderful theories freely, so that the excessively tense nerves can be relaxed. Wouldn't that be great? However, the current venue is too noisy, only suitable for those drunken and extravagant gentlemen to seek pleasure. It's really not suitable for us poor scholars to sit there and talk. Therefore, I formally propose to Mr. Shen Nianhua, Mr. Lin Jinshan, and others. Please have mercy and change the place.</p>
<p>(2) I think we should buy a thicker ten-line notebook (preferably bound pages) for signing our names in order. First-time attendees must provide their mailing address and occupation for future communication. The signatures from the previous four sessions can be pasted in the front. In this way, the number of people each time can also be easily calculated. Over time, it may be helpful for the anecdotes of the literary and art circles. I wonder what you think?</p>
<p>(3) Ding Yi</p>
<p>The literary tea party has been held five times as of the 24th of this month. I participated in the first, fourth, and fifth times. I was not in Shanghai for the second and third times, so I couldn't attend.</p>
<p>The purpose of this gathering, as Mr. Hualin said in the first meeting, is just to talk about "friendship" and "love between friends." Yes, doesn't life need "love"? Is the realm of "love" limited to relationships between the sexes and within the family? Do friends need "love"? As human knowledge has developed to this day, I don't believe anyone can find a reason to answer in the negative!</p>
<p>The role of the literary tea party is only in tea and talking about "literature and art." Literature and art take love as its content. Only with love can there be beauty, and only with love can there be vitality. Therefore, this is also one of the places for cultivating the seeds of love in the world. If you don't believe it, please sit in the corner of this room, look around the room, and you will see people of all ages, with both grandeur and elegance. Some gather in groups of three or five, while others talk in pairs. You can only see sincere and modest expressions, and you can't find any pretentious or arrogant attitudes. What a harmonious scene! It is also a beautiful picture! That's the impression I have after returning from the meeting.</p>
<p>If we could invite a senior member to give a free talk at each meeting, of any length and on any topic, whether it be writing experience or daily observations (both special topics and casual talks are good, whether about flies or the universe), and let him improvise and express his unfettered opinions. It would be a very meaningful thing to allow the young people attending (including myself) to learn more about what makes art art. This is my hope and my proposal.</p>
<p>(4) Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>Brothers Hualin and Jinshan sent three letters, asking me to reply in general. Before this, I also read Mr. Qingyang's letter and publicly replied to it in another newspaper. As the initiator, I am very grateful for everyone's concern for the "Literary Tea Party"! This tea party originally belongs to "everyone," and it should be cherished and improved by "everyone." Hualin, Chuntai, Chengyin, Jinshan, Yachen, and I are just doing a little more legwork.</p>
<p>At the fifth tea party, Hualin, Hanqiu, Jianhua, and I talked about: I don't know if we are old, or if society is old? In the past, the "Literary Tea Party" didn't have much preparation, but every time it was held, everyone would "automatically" speak, "automatically" perform, and "automatically" bring out works to ask for advice. In short, it was much more innocent than now! Since "innocence" has decreased now—whether it's age or the social environment that caused it—why not increase "artificiality" without utilitarian colors, which is what is called "preparation." However, when preparation is mentioned, there are two points that everyone needs to pay attention to: (1) "Everyone" should work hard to prepare and avoid focusing on a few people; (2) Busy. Busy. The poorer one is, the busier one gets. Now everyone is busier than before, so the progress of preparation will inevitably be slower and more difficult than before.</p>
<p>Although the location of the fifth tea party was still in the wine house on the fifth floor, it was changed to room number one. Mr. Jianhua participated and was very satisfied, saying: "It's very quiet here, we can talk!" The signature book originally didn't use several pages, so the two points raised by Mr. Jianhua can be said to be fully answered. As for the proactive talks proposed by Mr. Zong Lu and the love between friends indicated by Mr. Yi, it is exactly what is said, "Great minds think alike." We only need to work hard together under the important conditions of "harmony" and "simplicity"!</p>

<p>康克靈, 茜兒特, is Mrs. Grace Hazard Conkling's daughter. Born in 1910, she is 36 years old this year. She was able to sing her own poems at the age of three. Her mother recorded her childhood feelings and poems. Like the "Poems of a Little Girl" at the age of ten and "The Shoes of the Wind" at the age of twelve, they are enough to prove her natural talent. The First World War broke out in 1914. She was only three or four years old at that time. That is to say, cruel wars were produced, but her beautiful poems were also produced. From the perspective of art and war, no, from the perspective of poetry and life, what a great hint this is! Kang's poems are vivid, innocent, and full of original purity.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 109</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This dance was, of course, extremely enjoyable, because both of them had smiles of victory on their faces. Who is the victor after all? Presumably, both of them thought they had won. This dance seemed to end Hemi Michiichi's busy day, and it also seemed to end his and Pingzi's adventure if it was really an adventure. After the dance, it was already two o'clock. The various people in the dance hall had already dispersed. Hemi and Pingzi were also preparing to go home, but they argued with each other, wanting to use their own cars to send the other person to their residence first. Hemi took Pingzi out of the dance hall. The two of them walked to the coat check, Hemi took his hat, and Pingzi took her shawl. They still followed Western etiquette, half-supporting and half-entwining, and walked out of the Mitsukoshi gate. At this time, neither of them paid attention. Suddenly, four burly Westerners rushed out from both sides and behind, covering the two of them with weapons. One of them was also wearing a tuxedo, with a monocle hanging from his chest, looking like a European aristocrat. He spoke fluent Japanese with a stiff accent:</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry, because of official business, please move to my superior's place for a few words... As long as you don't make any unexpected moves, I would never dare to be rude!"</p>
<p>"Who is your superior?" Hemi's attitude was unusually calm. While asking this question, he glanced at the people surrounding him, and he was also paying attention to Pingzi's expression. Pingzi lowered her head, returning to the traditional shy attitude of Japanese women.</p>
<p>"You will naturally understand when you get there. It's useless to say it." The monocle gentleman replied so simply, "Please get in the car beautifully!"</p>
<p>"Our country has laws. Please think thoroughly about whether this kind of behavior is legal!" Hemi resisted.</p>
<p>"What I represent is the strictest law in your country."</p>
<p>"Mr. Hemi," Pingzi frowned and glanced at Hemi, then lowered her head again, "Just go for a while, their superior is someone you know."</p>
<p>Hemi looked around. Not to mention his own car, even the shadow of Yezhu was nowhere to be seen. Number 012 and his men were also nowhere to be seen. Looking at the situation, putting the monocle gentleman's words and Pingzi's words together, he thought for a while and knew that this was a special situation. It was useless to resist, so he could only get into the gentleman's car beautifully. Pingzi also followed into the car and sat with Hemi, while the gentleman sat next to Pingzi.</p>
<p>Just as this car was about to start, a gorgeous car came speeding towards them, suddenly stopping at the door of the dance hall, blocking the way of this car. As soon as the car stopped, two middle-aged men dressed as military officers jumped out, followed by an elderly man in a kimono, and two others who seemed to be attendants or guards. After this group of people came down, they all raised their heads towards the dance troupe's gate, as if to identify whether the location was correct.</p>
<p>"Uncle Inoue," Pingzi shouted inside the car, "There is no music in the dance hall." The word "music" was clearly a code word.</p>

<h3>Cold Wave</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The Siberian cold wave is invading mainland China. The temperature in the Yangtze River area has suddenly dropped to around zero degrees. According to a special report from this newspaper: Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Hankou and other places are all covered in snow, forming a silver-white world. Although it hasn't snowed in Shanghai, it has indeed been very cold these past two days.</p>
<p>As the climate gets colder, winter supplies are taking the opportunity to raise prices. For example, bituminous coal, the second layer of Kaiping, has reached 345,000 yuan per ton, and the black market price of coal balls has also reached 245,000 yuan per ton. This winter, under this situation, everyone will inevitably have to struggle through it with their hands and feet tied.</p>
<p>Living in a house, wearing warm clothes, and eating three meals a day, no matter how cold it is, it won't be life-threatening. Thinking about those who are wandering on the streets, without food or clothing, what a miserable situation that is! For them, every minute and every second is a struggle on the line of life and death, and these people, in places further away, such as northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and the Northeast... there are tens of thousands of them. We may not be able to witness them with our own eyes, but around us, can we turn a blind eye to these suffering people scattered in various parts of Shanghai?</p>
<p>In the past, wealthy Chinese people who were kind and generous often provided tea, porridge, clothes, and medicine as the seasons changed, and even provided coffins. Regardless of the impact or the motives, at least it preserved a part of human sympathy and showed people to do good. What contribution does this kind of social relief work that comes from the people contribute to the establishment of social morality on the passive side, even less than the relief work itself?</p>
<p>The weather is cold and freezing, please give those who eat the wind and drink the dew a little warmth!</p>
<p>Secret History of World War II</p>
<h3>Atomic Bomb Almost Used by the Nazis 3</h3>
<p>— Lan Ning translated from the November issue of "Reader's Digest"</p>
<p>After the meeting, things progressed rapidly. Now they had a total of eleven Norwegians, hiding in the "Finch" hiding place, secretly discussing. Aino provided the latest information about guard locations, shift change times, etc. The attackers would follow several miles of steep, rugged, snow-covered mountain roads down, climb down a thousand-foot-deep valley, cross a rushing mountain stream, and then climb up a thousand-foot-high mountain wall to reach the railway fence leading to the factory. As long as there was a hint of warning, the entire area would be lit up by searchlights.</p>
<p>Extremely Dangerous</p>
<p>At eight o'clock in the morning on February 27th, nine people set off. Carrying sensitive explosives, wading through deep valleys and cliffs was extremely difficult. Melting ice filled the rushing stream. Fortunately, they finally found a small ice bridge, which allowed them to pass safely. Then they began to climb the rock. Lonnie, the leader of the team, kept looking at his watch, allowing little time for delay. In this way, they climbed up this thousand-foot-high cliff inch by inch. These Norwegians knew that one slip would be the end of everything.</p>
<p>Finally reaching the top, they crawled forward along the railway fence with their greatest effort. Now they were only five hundred feet away from the factory. They could already hear the rumbling of the machines. Lonnie made a final quiet discussion with everyone to make sure that everyone understood their respective tasks. "It's time," he finally said. One of the men, taking a sharp steel shear, went over first. Then came the low sound of the steel lock breaking. The rest of the men immediately and nimbly followed through the steel bucket. Five men with Thompson guns quietly surrounded the barracks where twelve German soldiers lived. If there was an alarm, the German soldiers would be shot to death as soon as they came out.</p>
<p>Thanks to Dr. Tronstad's precise training, Lonnie's four demolition teams crossed the winding passages in a few minutes and found the high-pressure room.</p>
<p>The guard there was suddenly startled by two guns protruding from the dark ceiling wall. He had no choice but to obey. Lonnie skillfully wrapped the machine and the heavy water tank together and tied on the bomb—something he had trained in England, so he knew which things were most easily damaged. At this time, the other team members had also completed their deployment and arrived here.</p>
<p>The alarm had not sounded yet. Lonnie lit a thirty-second fuse and turned around to tell the guard (he was Norwegian) to escape. They had escaped twenty yards from the house when they heard a deafening explosion.</p>
<p>Alarm</p>
<p>As the alarm echoed across the sky, drowsy German soldiers rushed out with their guns. Lonnie and his men had already returned along the difficult and steep route that the German soldiers seemed unable to fly across. At this time, the tank broke and a thousand pounds of priceless heavy water flowed into the gutter.</p>
<p>In less than a few hours, German Commander General Falkenhorst rushed to Vermork. After inspecting, he declared: "This is the most severe destruction I have ever seen." He issued an order to gather an entire German force of more than 12,000 men in the area. Ski patrols and slowly flying reconnaissance planes searched the mountains. All roads and mountain paths were blocked, and Nazi and stormtroopers searched residents door to door. But these attackers were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Five of the "Marksman" team members had quickly skied across the Swedish border and safely returned to London. The sixth, Poncha, stayed with four "Finch" team members to handle other underground work. They played a game of hide-and-seek with Falkenhorst's patrols on sleds.</p>
<p>Aino retreated to his small hut, telegraphed the results of the explosion, and continued to watch Norsk Hydro.</p>
<p>Success</p>
<p>In the winter of 1943, Aino telegraphed that the damage had been repaired and the factory had resumed production. A bomber squadron of the US Eighth Air Force immediately bombed the factory's power station. So the Germans decided to move all the heavy water manufacturing equipment and the manufactured heavy water from Norsk Hydro to an underground factory site in Germany. These materials were scheduled to be loaded onto trucks and carried by the railway ferry "Hydro" across Lake Tinn. Aino requested headquarters to allow him to sink the "Hydro." The promise came quickly, and Aino immediately ordered Poncha to come. At that time, Poncha was in a Norwegian underground organization fifty miles away. He mixed on the ship to arrange a fart by forging documents posing as a Norsk Hydro employee. Just before the boat sailed shortly before, he put in a time bomb.</p>
<p>A few days later, the last batch of German heavy water had sunk to the bottom of Lake Tinnsjø. Hitler's plan to build an atomic bomb was delayed and then stalled. They had to turn to the manufacture of other new weapons. But we—the people of the Allied countries, will always be grateful to these eleven brave Norwegians. (The end)</p>

<h3>Organization of Beggars 3</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Each bucket is presided over by a "Uncle" generation, and also accommodates from five or six to more than ten of the younger generation. Too many people will not be able to accommodate themselves, and too few will be weak and insufficient to resist foreign insults. Only when the uncle has occupied the bucket can the problem of food and lodging be solved. Then they began to develop their power and worked hard to "scrape money." First, they put their minds into the surrounding section of the bucket. The first step was to bow and make a smiling face to the shop owners and vendors. The meaning is, "I am the new servant sent to manage this area. Please take care of me, big boss." So every New Year's holiday, celebration day, and even funeral day, the uncle can ask the store for rewards. The second step is to start investigating the "household registration" of each household in the jurisdiction. In fact, the purpose is not the household registration, but the reality of whether they are rich or poor. What kind of brokerage, whether there are secret deals, or what grudges they have with whom, etc. Because these people are afraid that the world will not be in chaos. They most hope that people will have quarrels or conflicts, and they can participate in them and get profits. The third step is to investigate how many stores in the territory provide packed lunches, and how many packed lunches are carried by shop assistants every day. Because "cold rice" belongs to them.</p>
<p>Attack on Vendors</p>
<p>Chinese shops have always been charitable and generous. In addition to responding to requests on weekdays, they give even more rewards during festivals. Especially the street vendors, in order not to make enemies with these old brothers, often pay the rewards with pain. All of these are the main income of the uncles in this section. Gathering a little can make a lot, and the amount is quite considerable. In addition to taking out a part as a reward for the younger generation, most of it goes into their own pockets. Therefore, whoever occupies the "bucket" can be successful in all directions and not worry about the source of income being cut off. As for daily meals, the younger ghosts will naturally respect them with stolen cold rice. Therefore, the bucket is really the lifeblood of the beggar gang, just like a place that soldiers must compete for.</p>
<p>The beggar gang asks shops and vendors for money, which has accumulated over the years. In the eyes of the merchants, it is a kind of unjustified money, but the beggar gang is very respectful and pretends to be paid voluntarily by the merchants. If other gangsters plot against the merchants, the old brothers will come out righteously and fight for justice on their behalf. In fact, those gangsters are originally in collusion with the gang, nominally protecting them, but in fact it is a disguised form of blackmail. But if the merchants refuse to give rewards, the old brothers will come up with all kinds of tricks and play with the vendors in every way, inciting other gangsters to take the opportunity to bully them.</p>
<p>If it is a food stall, they will gather to eat and leave without paying a penny, or pour kerosene on the stall items, unless the vendors are forced to pay in fear of difficulty. According to the spokesperson of the gang, this is really because the territory is difficult to occupy. If they show weakness to certain vendors once, it will lead other merchants to compete to follow suit and cut off the beggar gang's lifeline. Therefore, they have to "do everything possible to achieve the effect of punishing one as a warning to a hundred." If the merchants call the police and chase after them, it will be of no avail. Because the patrols of the "concession" in the past were most troubled by these "gangs." These people regard the police station as a hotel, and they have food and lodging in the detention center, and they don't think it is a hardship. The foreign adults in the police station are not willing to let these dirty old brothers pollute their clean cells.</p>
<h3>The Carriage Is Society</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>There is nothing better than the current Shanghai carriage to describe today's society. Inside there is: squeezing (exclusion), crushing (infighting), corruption (taking advantage), secret theft (pickpocket), open theft (not buying tickets), fraud (insufficient ticket purchase), abuse of power (the car does not stop at the station), disregard for human life (the car drives away when passengers are getting off or on), and selfishness (smoking).</p>
<p>Looking at the carriage and then looking at society, I don't think the strangeness of today's society is surprising. Looking at society and then looking at the carriage, I think it is inevitable.</p>
<h3>A Trite Saying</h3>
<p>— Hong Guo</p>
<p>In today's cities, everyone is busy with life problems and busy chasing fame and fortune. I don't know how many people lack not vitamins but exercise.</p>
<p>Exercise, sports, this familiar and vulgar slogan, was promoted to us when we were in elementary school, but to this day, I don't know how many people have suffered a similar loss: no exercise!</p>
<p>If there is really an omnipotent tonic in the world, that tonic is: continuous and appropriate exercise!</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Words</h3>
<p>— Guo Hong</p>
<p>Once a foreign friend said the following words to me:</p>
<p>"You Chinese have some difficult-to-describe humor, and often use life as a capital for humor. For example, eating! Many people have a table of dishes, Zhang San uses chopsticks, Li Si uses a spoon, turning the soup into dishwater; turning delicacies into piles of saliva, and even knowing that there are people with T.B. or other infectious diseases at the table, they still don't care. Once I couldn't stand it anymore and advised them to implement a separate eating system—this has long been implemented in our country. They perfunctorily answered me, but behind my back they were saying 'We Chinese don't need the same hygiene as foreigners'!"</p>

<p>Weekly Chat: How to Spend Sunday?</p>
<h3>Small Government Employee</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>Sunday, for us small government employees, is like a pill coated with sugar, or a licorice tea that cannot stimulate any effect.</p>
<p>To say Sunday is like a pill is because it inherently carries a strong bitter taste. The bitter life of a government employee is fated, struggling to make ends meet, living from hand to mouth, the pace of years is arduous and melancholic, like a long and weary journey. Of course, one longs for way stations along the journey, and Sunday is the way station; this way station is the sugar coating outside the pill, the sugar coating can always give you a brief temptation and comfort. However, the erosion of the sugar coating is still the continuation of bitterness, just as after you enjoy the Sunday, you still have to step back into that eternally weary journey of life with trembling and shrinking feelings.</p>
<p>To say Sunday is like licorice tea is because it itself cannot make you taste the joy of replenishment and recovery. Chinese medicine prescriptions cannot lack the accompaniment of licorice, just as our lives cannot lack the embellishment of Sunday. Licorice varies in its function due to the properties of the medicine, and Sunday also varies in sweetness and sourness depending on people's wealth; the movie theaters on Sunday raise their prices, and the parks on Sunday are filled with leisurely people. It's better to just stay at home! But what is there to linger for at home? Desolate walls, even the sunlight is melancholic, lonely and desolate, and leisure will only aggravate your fantasies. Like lightly sipping a cup of licorice tea, just a wisp of sweetness, the chronic illness of your life will definitely not improve because of this.</p>
<p>The life of a small government employee is a pool of eternal still water, and Sunday is just an occasional ripple in the still water; the ripple cannot stir up the waves of the still water, and Sunday will not bring us the rare joy of life.</p>
<h3>The Little Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Da Bing</p>
<p>"One, two, three, four! "Forward march!" The days passed too boringly.</p>
<p>The monotonous and dull military camp life makes us look forward to the arrival of Sunday every day, but Sunday is not necessarily ours, if we are not on duty or in service, we can only go out once or twice a month to take a breather.</p>
<p>It's strange to say, it's rare for us to come out and have fun, and many people seem to dislike our rare outing. When they see us in the theater, they put on a helpless look, their hospitality to the national army is not on Sunday. When buying tickets on the tram, the passengers seem to wink and make faces behind our backs. When we go to the store to buy something, the clerks speak to you in Mandarin in a strange tone, the more you don't understand, the more they want to talk to you, and I really can't hold back a fire in my heart. Just as I was about to raise my hand, I felt only a little over a thousand dollars in my pocket, with a large stack of ten-dollar bills. Forget it, I don't blame them!</p>
<p>Sunday passed so quickly, and after strolling on the road for two hours, it was already dusk. Thinking of the slow pace during drill practice, I was so angry that I wanted to cry. Heaven also likes to make fun of us.</p>
<p>Sunday seems like a shadow on our bodies, we can't catch it, and we can't let it go. It's always so numb, and extremely sad. I really want to beat it up!</p>
<h3>The King Without Evenings</h3>
<p>— Hong Yin</p>
<p>I often say: "Journalists seem to have every day as Sunday, but in reality, 365 days have no Sunday." But in the former era of the Municipal Council, when anti-Japanese newspapers were fined and suspended, it was an unexpected vacation. Now, the times no longer allow me to rest. Even the New Year's Eve and the New Year this year, I am afraid that the newspapers will not necessarily suspend publication. Last National Day, the newspapers were still published.</p>
<p>Sunday, this "lovely" day, is not important to us who are nervous day and night in interviewing or scissors and paste. If it is said that newspapermen have Sundays and holidays, then those who work outside should sleep all day to relax their nerves, and those who work inside should sleep all night on Saturday night and bask in the sun all day on Sunday.</p>
