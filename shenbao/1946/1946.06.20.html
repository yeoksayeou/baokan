<h3 id="c1">中共不履行整軍方案　談判前途又趨黯淡　三方代表正在進行折衝 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕停戰公吿已頒發十三日，停戰限期至廿二日中午止，十九日夜計之，實存不過六十小時，十九日記者整日　遍詢各方之結果，獲悉和平談判已因中共不願忠實履行整軍方案，反對馬使仲裁權，並在恢復交通之方案內要求護路警察權而吿擱淺。據接近中共之人士談，周恩來現期待延安之復電，如今晚或夜間接得指示，擬隨時趨訪馬使商談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕傳政府所提整編統編方案，對關内外共軍駐區均有明確合理之規定，東北方面許可共軍在齊齊哈爾·海闌泡·永吉駐兵三師，但在華北方面須减除二師，共軍並須退出哈爾濱·熱河·察哈爾及山東之烟台·威海衛·且須退出津浦綫之德州·泰安·臨城及臨棗支綫之棗莊及張店·周村·膠縣各地，共軍對駐區之要求，則包括東北吉·黑及熱，察，綏三省及冀，魯，豫，皖，蘇各省之大部，如此訊果確，則雙方因距離甚遠，難望獲致協議。據中共人士自稱，中共已面臨一性命「性命交關」之難關。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十九日電，〕此間過去廿四小時內，對會商前途之樂觀空氣，今因共黨未能接受蔣主席所提整軍及華北與東北共軍駐軍區域之新建義，而又轉趨黯淡。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕今日上午民盟代表沈鈞儒·黃炎培·章伯鈞等曾往訪周恩來，聞會談兩小時許，未獲結果。聞周恩來竟日未活動。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕靑年黨·民主同盟·社會賢達代表曾琦·張君勱·陳啟天·莫德惠·王雲五·沈鈞儒·余家菊·張申府·梁漱溟等十餘人，十九日下午四時假靑年黨代表團辦事處集會，硏討當前時局問題，討論甚久，最後獲得結論：（一）希望政府延長停戰談判期間，使三項問題能獲完全協議，（二）希望中共贊同馬歇爾仲裁辦法，以便眞正實行停戰。據悉，渠等並定廿日分別約請政府及中共代表，說明前項意見。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶十九日電〕交通部長兪大維今日重申停戰期滿後政府對於安東·松江·嫩江·黑龍江·興安及大連等地接收之決意。兪氏並稱：共軍「應在不致有　接收工作之地區内集中。」</p>
<h3 id="c2">盼共方顧念民衆痛苦　速共同促成協議　彭部長執行外記者談話 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕外記者招待會，十九下午四時於行政院會議室舉行，由彭部長學沛，劉次長錯主持，宋院長子文亦出席參加，茲錄彭部長答覆之各主要問題如次：</p>
<p>間，和平談判現在情形如何？</p>
<p>彭答，最近數日，馬帥與政府代表等辛勤工作，夜以繼日，政府所提方案，均力求明確具體，惜共方回答每嫌空泛，政府爲求迅速解決起見，已於退讓之後、繼以退讓，希望共方顧念民衆之痛苦，毅然決心共同促成早日之協議，余盼三人會議日内即可開會。</p>
<p>問，政府是否堅持共方必須接受公斷權建議，以爲解決之先決條件？</p>
<p>彭答，任何協議，必須能於一定期限内切實實施，方有價値，鑒於過去經騐，共方每多延宕，以致協定實施無期，而其效力全被取消，故此次政府堅持授美方代表以公斷權，以期得迅速有效之解決。至有人謂此將損害中國主權，殊關曲解，歷來各大國間之糾紛，往往提請海牙法庭公斷，公斷法官爲第三國人，並無損於任何獨立國之主權，美方代表公斷，祗爲臨時性質，事實上三人會議之軍事調處執行部，於政府與共黨代表之外，已有美方代表，並爲政府及共方所歡迎與欽佩。</p>
<p>問，山東政府各據點受共軍攻擊之嚴重威脅，政府於此對策如何？政府是否正在由海空兩方趕運援兵赴山東？</p>
<p>彭答，此問題之詳細解答，已見今日各報所登載之政府對軍事調處執行部一備忘錄，政府原在山東各處之部隊，數量甚爲微小，故共軍得以攻城略地，不勞費力，但政府並於如濟南·靑島等之重要城市被共軍攻入近郊，重兵包圍，不能熟視無覩，保土衛民，爲任何政府最低限度之責任，此種增援，仍衹爲自衛之防禦性質，政府希望共軍立即停止進攻，並撤退六月七日以後所强佔之城市，以期和平解決。</p>
<p>問，聞政府對於二月廿五日之協定，已以一修正案之備忘錄交馬歇爾將軍是否確實？又政府是否願意討論東北駐軍比額之修改</p>
<p>彭答，政府關於二月廿五日協定之建議，係規定恢復交通案之施行辦法，政府爲表示退讓起見，已接受共方關於交通問題多數之要求。至於東北軍隊之比例，政府亦已作重要之讓步，以促進迅速之解決。</p>
<p>問，聞共黨要求政府中三個部，包括內政部，確否？</p>
<p>彭答，在十五日期間，雙方集中討論蔣主席停戰命令中所提示之三個問題，未及其他。</p>
<h3 id="c3">廣州宣布戒備　嚴防共軍暴動 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社廣州十八日電〕廣州行營發言人今日宣稱，中共企圖在廣州暴動，故此間軍政當局不得不按戶搜索，並宣布戒備。今後或將採取更嚴厲措置，惟居民將感覺不便耳。同時，英國領事霍爾及外交部專員郭德華今日前往香港，磋商國民日報被罰停刋事。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十八日電〕廣東中共武裝人員在東江兩岸人數，約二千人，現已集中大鵬灣，北江王作堯等部约九百人，亦在南移中，約廿五日前可抵大鵬灣。</p>
<h3 id="c4">宋院長談話　說明經濟政策 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕行政院長朱子文，十九日下午五時首次出席中宣部記者招待會，曾以懇切明爽之語氣，答復本報記者下列詢問：（一）問目前和平談判中，不知院長對於關係國內經濟。金融·物價及國民生計曁中共在各地濫發之紙幣曾否提出討論，對於將來收拾此種「抗幣」之善後問題，已否預爲計及？答：一俟政府與中共商談之軍事·政治·交通諸問題談妥後，此一問題亦可迎刃而解，至有關「抗幣」及中共發行類似「抗幣」之他種紙幣，將來之善後問題，事關國民經濟，政院及財部已在審愼硏究準備中（二）間希望院長每週或兩週在政院舉行記者招待會一次由院長親自擇要報吿已辦待辦或正在計劃中之各項要政，並答覆記者詢問，俾國人對國家大政有淸楚之認識，答·本人因職責繁重，不事宣傳，甚少與外界接近，故對余行政處事不多接觸者，難免隔閡，今後願於定期或不定期之各種集會中，盡情答覆各位及外界之詢問，藉領敎益。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十九日電〕宋院長本日發表談話：說明中國之經濟政策，答復言論界之攻擊，並預言目前之談判倘能獲致永久和平，則此項政策「必能於短時期内重建經濟之穩定」。宋氏以中國之經濟上及其他病態歸咎於八年戰爭後繼以内戰之結果，因其破壞交通、阻止糧食及貨運之暢通也。渠對於最近美國「時代」雜誌爲文指陳中國生存於「亂倫式的經濟制度」下，指此種吹毛求疵的文章爲「猥褻思想之暴露」。宋氏逐項答復「時代週刋」之譴責，否認政府有經營商業排擠私人企業之行爲。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕十九日爲東北停戰之第十三天，軍調部，呈現緊張前夕之沉寂，政府與中共已數日無會，靜待廿二日揭曉，與二方代表談話，均避免觸及時局。</p>

<p>盼共軍履行協定否則應負破壞責任　運兵赴青島及濟南係自衛防御性質</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕政府致北平軍調部備忘錄大意如下：「本年一月十“停戰協定後，政府爲切實履行協定，貫澈和平建國之初衷，遂停止進軍及調動軍隊，並同時遵照軍隊整編統編之協定，乃大量裁編軍隊，不料共軍利用此時機，自始即違犯協定，大舉移動軍隊，到處進攻或圍困國軍，先後攻佔綏遠之集寗，熱河之建平，山西之候馬，河北之玉田·東明，山東之明水·龍山，河南之夏邑，數度進攻蘇北，不斷破壞交通，並包圍國軍據守之城鎭，共有十七處之多。始終不肯依照調處之協議解圍，且積極封鎖物資，斷絕軍民生機，禁止人民交通出入，政府爲謀取和平誠意，一再容忍，始終處於消極性自衛，凡在協定範圍以内各地，並未調兵增援。及至本月六日，政府重申停戰令以後，共軍仍利用此停戰時機，突然於本月七日起，在華北·華中與東北各地發動全面攻勢，而以山東爲尤甚，其在山東所攻佔之重要據點，爲張店·周村·德州·泰安·棗莊·高密·膠縣·南泉·藍村·芝蘭莊及其他多處城鎭，同時破壞蘇魯交界之韓莊運河鐵橋（此橋係停戰後修復者）。處此情况，政府仍一再容忍，期再予共黨一機會，謀獲取和平，始終未採取積極性措置，而共軍並不以此爲足，乃復在靑島外圍集結大軍五萬，濟南外圍集結大軍十餘萬，且不斷增加，對該兩城市區之近郊猛烈圍攻，尤以進逼靑島之水源地南泉黃埠情勢最爲險惡，而且該島與倉口機塲亦皆受其威脅。至於濟南之煤糧區，被阻更烈，日來且已逼近濟南城區近郊之党家莊與箇山等處，致使各該等地之情况危急異常，軍民生計且日益危殆，政府一再喚起共軍注意，並要求其停止進攻，迄今皆置之不理。今爲自衛之絕對需要，不得已，已將第五十四軍等運送靑島，第七十三軍等運送濟南，然政府此舉，依然爲自衛之防禦性質，仍盼共軍能迅速覺悟，立即停止進攻，遵守停戰協定，以和平手段解決問題，並立即退出停戰後所攻佔之城市，交還政府，以示履行協定謀取和平之誠意，否則共軍應負破壞和平及因此而發生一切不幸之責任。</p>

<h3 id="c34">中國之經濟問題 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 王德泉</p>
<p>全國上下，現正為物價問題而苦惱！物價頻頻上漲，人民生活，益形艱難，惶惶不可終日；工業界則又正嫌外匯率過低，國產品不敵舶來品之價廉物美，而恐懼本身之行將崩潰。投機之輩，乃利用此種心理，散播謠諑，推波助瀾，掀起黃金與外匯之漲風。不察者聞之，或喜或慮。實則物價問題與外匯率問題，乃一問題之正反面，貨幣之價値，對內則以物價表現之，對外則以外匯率表現之。按之常理，貨幣對內之購買力，與對外之購買力，必須得到平衡，在目前貨幣對內購買力尚未隱定時，而就懸測外匯力之變化，不免有坐井觀天之議。</p>
<p>試以今日為例；若將匯率提高，徒然刺激國內物價上漲，法幣購買力再度降低；反之，如目前政府所實施之外匯政策，將匯率固定不變，以求國內物價下降，使法幣對內購買力與對外購買力相接近，此雖能見效於一時，但亦終非善策。因為中央銀行雖擁有巨量之外匯基金，然以此基金去　無窮之溝壑，憂憂乎其難哉!一旦外匯基金吿擊，匯率勢必飛騰，國內物價又將無法控制，前功勢必盡棄。況國內企業，亦將因不敵舶來品之傾銷，不待外匯基金用　，而已吿崩潰。所以目前解決中國經濟問題的辦法，應將物價問題與外匯問題，同時雙管齊下，以求　功。</p>
<p>安定國內物價，首在求生產品供應量之增加。生產品供給量增加之　有二：即恢復本國之產業，同時鼓勵外貨輸入，以　本國生產量上不足，此為積極的辦法。消極方面，應當鼓勵國民，　　節約運動，減少消　　品，同時政府應　　停止增發　　　　　　到通貨流通速度之遲緩，促成物價之低落。</p>
<p>目前中國生產問題之癓結，大要不外左列各點：</p>
<p>（一）交通阻梗，運輸不便，原料之獲得及生產品之銷售，常因這昂而致企業不能獲利，一旦遭遇外貨競爭，自更莫能頡頒。所以通暢運輸，在今天實已刻不容緩，而政府當局更義不容辭。誰在今天還要破壞交通，梗阻運輸，誰就是中國生產事業之敵。</p>
<p>（二）工資過高，減低企業利潤。中國工人工資，素以低廉稱於世界，是以在不平等條約存在時，外人在吾國設廠，利用吾國低廉的人工，而吾國生產工業，雖技術落後，然以工資低廉，猶能勉強喘息自守。今日若干中國工人之工資，實際已高於美國工人之所得，加以其他種種生產上之困難問題，又焉能與外貨相競爭？是以工資應酌予減低。惟減低工資，應以抑平物價為先決條件，物價隆落，工資自能隨之而低，工人生活亦不致感覺困難。反之，物價高，工資亦高，工資與物價因果相循，勢必扼殺一切企業。觀乎月前工潮與物價漲風，每每相隨，其理自明。</p>
<p>（三）利率過高，企業界對資金之籌措，當苦不勝高利貸之負担，此亦為生產成本增高重要原因之一。政府對本國重要之生產業，應視其需要而予以長期低利之貸款，以減低其生產成本；在必要時，對本國某數種產業，更應給予生產獎助冿貼，以增強其在國際市場之競爭能力。</p>
<p>國際貿易之利益，除調劑國際間生產量之盈　外，即為促成國際間企業之分工。本國對某種物品不能生產或雖生產而處於不經濟之地位者，即當利用處於比較經濟地位之外國生產業　　　　　　。本國人民一方得以較低之代價而得到同樣之享受，同時更得盡其全力，以從事於特適本國生產之他種企業，以優厚之環境，低廉之成本，從事大量生產，除供給本國需要外，更盡量推銷國外。戰前各國，雖因政治之關係，施行關稅壁壘政策，然國際貿易，始終盛而勿疲者，自有其無可抗辯之利益存在於其間。惟鼓勵輸入，並非是盲目的，事先須經過統盤籌劃，而是有選擇性的。</p>
<p>次言安定匯價。安定匯價之澈底辦法，當在求國際收支之平衡，換言之，即對外匯之收入及支出須能得到平衡。如一國長期入超，勢必致支出巨貴之黃金，而致國家貧之，人民凋敝。惟欲求國際收支之平衡，須對整個國際貿易有一定的政策，旣對國際收支有統盤籌劃，且將國際貿易之功用發揮至其頂點。至於國際貿易政策如何運用，只要看關稅政策的如何運用。</p>
<p>中國對於外貨輸入本國，應充分運用關稅政策，自無待言。對本國不能生產或雖生產而處於不經濟地位之貨物，政府當僅征收低微之進口稅，以供財政之收入為目的；對本國生產量不敷的產物，政府應限制其輸入量，超過限額，即課以重稅；對於足與本國生產品處於競爭地位之舶來品，應征收極高度之關稅，甚或禁止其輸入，以保護本國之生產業；對於奢侈品等類，則絕對禁止其輸入，以節約本國之外匯。現在不平等條約旣已廢除，關稅業已自主，不受拘束，極端之關稅壁壘政策，固足以招致外國採取同標之報復手段，惟我國如實行此種保護本國幼稚生產業之關稅政策，世界貿易史上不乏前例，斷不致引起各國的誤會。</p>
<p>我國之農礦物及手工業產物之行銷世界各地者，有茶，絲，桐油，蛋，豬　，腸衣，錫，編，刺繡等，甚受各國歡迎。現在徒以成本過昂，無法輸出。此種現象，政府自不能漠視，現宜予以獎助。除出口稅應免征外，更宜給予輸出津貼，以促其有力外銷。　　工業製造品行銷南洋羣島者，亦不在少，今天自不能坐視此良好市場之喪失。吾人應消除生產問題之種種　結，獎勵生產，獎勵輸出，旣可藉以發展本國之生產業，復可從此獲得外匯，以支付輸入個貨所需之外滙。同時，政府對外滙之統制，應予加強，國內絕對不准行使外國貨幣，進出口商須滙集向中央銀行或其指定之銀行結購或結售外匯。戰前僑胞，每年以巨款匯回祖國，此亦為我國獲取外匯之一重要途徑，故政府對僑胞匯回款項，尤須予以充分便利，藉資鼓勵。</p>
<p>政府除對某數種產物出口，視其需要而定獎助之程度外，對輸出品之性質，自當由商品檢驗局嚴格論定，合格者方准出口，免遭外人滋生不良之印像。而國外市况之調查統計，也須由我國駐外領事館常期按時報吿，俾生產業者對國外市場之供求狀况，有充分之了解。凡此種種輔助國際貿易之設施，政府當局今天不但應該規劃，而且當力求實行。</p>
<p>或謂政府一方旣須停止通貨膨脹政策，則又何來巨款，以時關稅在不平等條約束縛下，未能充分自主，稅率低微，今不平等條約旣已廢棄，關稅業已自主，在實行關稅政策制度下，對本國不能生產或雖能生產而處於不經濟地位之輸入品，征收低率之關稅，同時對足與本國生產品處於競爭地們一家家輸入品，征收極高度之關稅，一方寓禁於征，一方則以此收入移充獎助之費用，此筆數字，必甚可觀。</p>
<p>中國之生產業，已因數月來不敵源源而來之廉價洋貨，動腦筋漸呈崩潰之朕兆。再不急起挽救，慘痛之後果，即將降臨！中國人口有四萬萬五千萬，佔全世界人口總數五分之一，况素以地大物博著稱，中國為世界最好之市場，中國人民為世界商品之良好主顧，一旦中國經濟崩潰，影響所及，足以波及整個世界之經濟。中國之繁榮，與世界之繁榮，息息相關。只要我政府大員，真心赤誠，為國家打算，急謀補救，使中國的經濟復蘇，不但國內　達必能　起贊助，即友邦當局亦必能諒解而予以助力，絕不致阻碍我們的正當措施。</p>

<h3 id="c35">四外長間又生異見　巴黎會議復蒙暗影　義國賠款問題相持難决　昨討論較易解决之問題 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十九日廣播：兩小時以前（上海午後十一時），四强外長在巴黎繼續舉行會議，討論與義大利有關之數項較小問題及法義邊界問題會議在進行中，結果未詳。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十九日電〕四國外長討論義大利和約，對義國賠償問題仍陷僵局，今日議程中批定者，係有關經濟之數項小問題及法義邊界問題，比較不難稱決。四外長定今日午後二時（上海時間午後十一時）會議，較平常會議時間提早一小時，俾法外長皮杜爾得出席制憲議會。四外長昨日會議時對義國賠償事，相持不下，致各方悲觀氣氛，更見深切。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十八日電〕四國外長會議今日討論義大利賠款問題，歷兩小時半之久，仍無結果，貝文建議，各大國應放棄義大利之賠款要求，並　助其民主政府。莫洛夫仍表示異議。貝爾納斯主張將以此項問題全部移交歐洲和平大會討論。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十九日電〕昨日傍晚，四强外長舉行會議時，英國對義大利問題所提建議一項，遭遇蘇聯之反對，因此又形成一新的僵局。英國建議四强放棄義之一切賠款要求，莫洛托夫堅持蘇聯必須自昔日之軸心國家獲得美金乙萬萬元之賠款，並在巴黎會議中提付決議，至於賠款一事，則大部份應取自目前之義大利生產部門。貝爾納斯對蘇聯之態度，採取堅强立塲，答以此舉之意，無非在以美國資助義國之數百萬美金給予蘇聯而已。莫洛托夫至此乃略作讓步，表示願意接受義國之奢華郵船「薩杜爾尼亞」與「波爾太尼亞」二姊妹號，抵作一萬萬元賠償要求內之一部份賠款。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十八日電〕外長會議今日對義賠償問題未成協議，但意見較前具有伸縮性。貝爾納斯與貝文仍主張蘇聯所要求之一萬萬元，可以義大利在前敵性與國內之財產及義大利之商船與軍艦抵付，莫洛托夫則堅持尚不足抵付一萬萬元之數，所缺尚需以義大利現有生產，在六年內予以補足。皮杜爾則以為倘此期限能在兩年內開始，則義大利可以為之。貝文對蘇法之建議皆表反對，認為此項主張不啻將昨日所同意之以「最惠國」待遇聯合國之條款，加以作廢云。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦十八日電〕貝文為打開義南疆界問題之僵局，已擬就新計劃，將於今後二日內，提出外長會議。該計劃建議將特里埃斯特及其附近區域劃為中立地界，由聯合國直接控制。</p>

<p>〔中央社紐約十七日電〕紐約時報社論以空前未有之兩行標題，控訴蘇聯。並稱：巴黎外長會議若不能依照　餓及為戰爭所困　之歐洲若干希望，對於起草和約，能有迅速確實之進步，則西方民主和國再不能對蘇聯投降，及允許其對於和平作無限之阻碍，並阻碍彼等自己之領導權，紐約時報並對蘇聯外交政策，予以最直率之批評。內稱：自德黑蘭會議以來，在國際强權政治中，蘇聯曾向其西方各盟國，要求最大讓步，但對各盟國之意見，則不報以讓步，繼即進而囊括刻所得者，且僅出以片面行為，即未得到盟國之認可，亦非遵照和平解決辦法，蘇聯所採之政策，係片面擴大勢力，實違反大西洋憲章，已勿庸置辯。該報最後對巴黎外長會議，坦白表示悲觀，並贊成貝爾納斯之建議，若巴黎會議再失敗時，將和約問題，提交廿一國和會，或聯合國討論，蓋因有關全世界之工作，必須繼續進行，不能單獨等待某一强國也。上交發表後，莫斯科報紙及無綫電廣播，對美國政策，均加批評。按紐約時報社論代表美國輿論中重要之一部份，且極受人注意，因其可以反映美國當局之意見至某種程度也。</p>

<p>— 本報駐美特派員　毛樹淸</p>
<p>福斯脫文章的開頭就說：蘇聯是注重經濟平　　而極端視個人自由的國家，因此，美　　外交的人，不能拿美國那種個人自由發展　　　的眼光，去歐觀察蘇聯，或批評蘇聯。然　他說拉網聯現在是安全第一，蘇聯深怕英美　　合力量，毁滅他的本土。福斯脫將蘇聯的　　，劃分為三個地帶，俄羅斯的本土是核心　　，然後向外推展到中層防衛地帶，再到外　　帶。據福斯脫的說法，蘇聯現在在歐洲亞　的　種例如『侵略』行動，都是為要增强他　　層防衛地帶而起的。</p>
<p>對蘇聯很不了解</p>
<p>這篇文章能產生多少影　，我無從知道，反正，今天在美國社會，能够吹一點『蘇聯』，那就是最智慧的人，哥侖比亞幾個『俄國通』的敎授，現在一言一行，都為美國社會所注意。有人說，美國人不了解中國。固然，美國人對中國還有很多隔膜。但是，美國人不了解蘇聯，恐怕這不了解的程度，較之不了解中國，更深百倍。從今年秋天起，哥侖比亞大學特設一『蘇俄學院』，由國務院，各部會及參謀本部，保送軍政界公務員研究，不收普通學生，更不歡迎外國學生入學。</p>
<p>在紐約幾百家書舖裏，要買有關蘇聯的書籍，較倫敦更少，不過，倫敦市上關於介紹蘇聯的書籍和小册子，多半是些宣傳品，親共的，或者叵共的，洋洋大著，性質比較專門，像從前韋勃夫婦所寫的那樣，也很少見。今年四五月間，紐約銷數最高的一批書單中間，有一本叫做『我寗擇自由』的，是描寫蘇聯的一本相當有趣味的好書。</p>
<p>那本書是今年年初才出版的，作者克萊佛契枸，原本是俄國烏克蘭人，他父親是一個共產革命者，因之，克萊佛契珂在幼年即受共產意識的熏陶，從列寗時代，過渡到史達林時代，他一直是忠誠的共產黨黨員，而且參加冶金工廠工作，因為他聰明努力，由工人而工頭，由工頭升到冶金工程師。希特勒侵蘇以後，他參加紅軍，任工兵總隊隊長。不久，他彼俄國政府派遣到美國來，任駐美購料委員會的會員。忽然，一九四四年四月四日，克萊佛契珂在華盛頓失蹤，從此與共產黨脫離關係，當時的美國報紙，都曾像偵探小說一樣，刋登過他的疑案，直到最近，他才公開發表了這部數十萬言的「自白」。</p>
<p>對中國兩種眼光</p>
<p>在經濟平等與個人自由不能兩全的環境之下，克萊佛契珂的經驗告訴讀者，他寗擇後者，所以他的書名，就叫做「我寗擇自由」。他是一篇極忠實的報導，他描寫許多蘇俄的長處，但也暴露一切蘇俄共產黨專政的黑幕。他說，這些看不慣的事，他一直是忍耐着不作聲的，一直到達美國以後，才獲得解放。作者很肯定的說：蘇聯在這次大戰中，能够獲得最後勝利，並非由於蘇維埃的制度，而由於俄國民族愛國力量發揮的奇蹟。</p>
<p>和克萊佛契珂同樣的理論，現在似乎在美國，逐漸的普遍起來。上次巴黎四國外長會議完畢，共和黨參議員范登堡，回美國以後的廣播演講，反覆申述到共產主義，和民主主義在理論上的對立，和在事實上的矛盾。有一張左傾的報紙，駡范登堡缺乏常識，那張報紙上說：共產主義的反面是資本主義，民主主義的反面是獨裁主義，說范登堡幼稚瞎湊。我不知道究竟是誰的幼稚？空間是誰的瞎湊？</p>
<p>紐約「下午報」，對巴黎會議的美國代表團攻擊最激烈。下午報的幾位社評健將股格素，賴納，他們先後發表了好幾篇文章，說貝爾納斯在外交上，作睹徒式的冒險。說貝爾納斯險了奉美國進入第三次戰爭以外，根本無能打開對蘇外交的僵局。在另一方面，由名記者鮑威爾，海軍上將顏魯爾領銜的「宣言」，　斥貝氏無能解决遠東問題，阻撓中國的統一建國。</p>
<p>對中國的外交，實在是不能推怨於國務院的，事實上，馬歇爾將軍的報告，根本沒有一件經過國務院，都是直接給杜魯門總統的。華盛頓國務院的人，有這樣一個傳說，說馬歇爾將軍到中國以前，曾經去請敎過前任大使赫爾利將軍。赫爾利將軍的肺腑之言，就是那麼一句：「千萬別讓這些事，給國務院這般傢伙知道」。赫爾利將軍是最瞧不起那般「老柚子」的美國職業外交家。赫爾利將軍說：他們對中國，有兩種眼光，不是傳統式的帝國主義眼光，便是維新了的共產主義眼光。</p>
<p>我沒有方法去探聽國務院內部的情形，事實上，一個外國新聞記者，頃全力去調查駐在　家的外交行政機構的內幕，也有所不該。但是，無論如何，今天美國國務院的工作，是繁重於過去任何一個時期內，因之，外來的責難和批評，也較過去任何一個時期為多。</p>
<p>然而，這些都不足以造成總統和國務卿之間的「鴻溝」，杜魯門先生不會調走一個政見和自己相同的國務卿，而容納另一個人來執行他的外交政策。國為，在今天美國人的心目中，或者在美國的政治圈子之中，杜魯門繼承下來的民主黨政府，相當的代表著「右派」，他的政策的向右轉，在外交上還沒有做到太過火的程度。但是，在內政上，從這一次罷工風潮以來，已經是弄到滿城風雨的了。（完）</p>

<p>該×達「公司」開設沿馬路舊法國式市房内，與其稱「公司」，不若將商店較爲確切。蓋其一切組織並不脗合公司法，其營業也惟有一個方針向頂崖者索取佣金而已。</p>
<p>據其經理人沈君稱：此「公司」已創設數月，依過去數月交易平均數而言，每月約有二十次頂屋成交。則其獲利亦相當可觀矣。</p>
<p>其所擁有之房屋（即出頂房屋）大半由朋友直接或間接紹介前來登記，逐行塡入登記簿中，如地段，大小房間數，電話，衛生設備，煤氣，頂費等項，如間接而來則頂屋成交時，中間人平均與「公司」獲取酬金。</p>
<p>當顧客（頂屋者）前來詢問房屋時，經理人依登記簿逐一介紹說明内容，並欲顧客塡寫委託書：內容聲明由「公司」代覓房屋，成交時「公司」收取十分之一佣金，不得拖欠，及付委託費二千元，此乃其每月正常收入之一項。試想每日约有二十人前往委託，公司即以委託費四萬元，即此委託費一項收入，每月已超百餘萬元矣。「公司」並無固定資本，惟電話機一架，寫字檯一隻及數把坐椅而已。「公司」並不雇用職員，由數人合夥而成，自兼經理跑街等聯。承吿該「公司」本爲一西醫診療室，由於生意冷淡，不堪維持生計，故改營今業，好在組織簡單，營業不振時，可隨時結束。</p>
<p>記者因用顧客身份相詢故允隨意觀其登記簿，其頂費自五條至三十條不等，此亦可見擁有房屋者之心狠，及營頂屋掮客者之厚利剝削矣（兆月）</p>

<p>昨糖市以台灣公司本有繼續拋　之意，故初市甚平，及該公司職員至公會察看，市氣甚堅，反而縮手，市場上對於該公司抑平物價之使命，遂發生疑問，更從事實上檢討，該公司前後間售中砂共衹四次，開售時，先由各行申請購額，視其食胃之多寡，以定市勢之疲俏，而該公司則須延至下午三四時始決定配額及價格，第四次申購之額達七萬包，供給之數僅九千五百包，價“由其目定，購者初無問言，然該公司猶以爲未足，前日乃改用逢高吐售之法，昨市則更進一步，雖高亦不供售，於是造成糖價疲而復漲之局，公會劃盤中砂百上午初爲九萬一千五百元及二千元，及聞公司止售，遂急劇上展至九萬八千五百元，下午初為原盤，旋至九萬九千元，以九萬八千元收　，比上日升六七千元，號貨隨緊，開泉州洋四十包，九萬一千元，興化白十萬零三千元至九萬八千元，二百餘簍，興赤九萬四五千元，刁靑百數十包，七萬四千元至六千元，黃崗靑八十包，七萬七千元。</p>
<p>又據臺糖公司經理宋以信氏談，該公司已由臺省起運食糖五千五百噸，約六萬包，由招商與馬勒船各一艘，於本月底前可扺滬，華北方面亦準備設化分公司，因台糖由基隆出口，卸滬後，再運華北，不啻需出二次運費棧費，無形增加糖價，現經査明台糖，直接運華北，其費用與運上海相等，故本公司决於最短時期，成立華北分銷處，外埠糖量充沛，則上海方面糖價，亦能自動抑平云。</p>

<p>防雨布邇日暢銷超過以往任何之一時，因過去衹爲民衆裁製雨衣之用，今夏則爲空陸二軍各界美式服裝所需要，尤以南京帮行銷特廣，先後統扯運銷已有七八千碼之譜，蓋聞徐州安慶西安等埠，亦均有需銷，向京地搜購，致其出路更加增盛，物稀爲貴，實銷旣大活躍，市貨即形供不敷求，行情乃節節上漲，每碼由四千元升漲至七千二百五十元，大半尙乏現貨，必需先向雨衣布廠商提早旬日訂定，先付定洋七成，一般防雨布廠商因此利市三倍，紛將次貨布坯染色出沽，顏色旣要退；且多跳絲條擋，但經營者衹求有利可圖，咸抱出品多而几快的主旨，不顧質地，偸工减料，近來出路已略受影響，行情亦降至六千餘元一碼矣。</p>

<h3 id="c130">廣西饑餓　柳州跳舞 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 本報柳州三日航訊　特約記者梁小中寄</p>
<p>據廣州報所載柳州消息，廣西全省到外都是飢民，他們情願將親生的子女讓給有力量的人去養活，以免留着活活的餓死。家有十幾歲的女孩子的人家，正在替女兒們找婆家。只有富人能够一天吃兩頓粥，飢民惟有啃樹皮草根。廣西米價最近已漲到七萬元一担，廣西本來是產米之區，這樣的價錢，已經算非常之高了，廣西所以發生災荒，是為了兩個恰恰相反的原因，即起先久旱不雨，隨後又下雨太多。柳州和梧州，路旁可以看到躺着的飢民，其餘路過的人都是精神沮喪，沒有一個人對路旁奄奄待斃的飢民加以注意，因為這樣的情景，早已司空見慣了。</p>
<p>上述的情形，見於聯合社廣州十八日電訊，現在接得本報特約記者的航訊，報道了最近的柳州詳情，足資印證，尤其令人感慨萬千。（編者）</p>
<p>蒼茫的夜色裏，車子相伴着一片斜風細雨、又再度把我帶入這一顆廣西的心臟來。</p>
<p>立魚峯巒下繚繞着紗樣的烟雲，淡黃的燈光照着破碎的馬路，照着路上的泥水，照着路旁櫛比相連的茅茨。一切都顯得那末慘淡，那末陰森，無情的砲火，把這一顆心臟弄到支離破碎了。</p>
<p>新樓房破瓦礫　織成强烈對比</p>
<p>轉過立魚峯，進入市區，彷彿踏入了另外一個世界，巍然聳立的新建築，在瓦礫堆裏驕傲的挺直了驅幹。車運公司，地產公司，銀行……一眼望過去，還有遠處，簇新的樓房，和着敗壁斷牆相間地織成一個强烈的對比。「復原的時候快了，」我的心裏這樣想着。兩年前的柳州的一個樣，一年前的柳州又是一個樣，而今的柳州，又正向着新生的路迅速地變，滄海桑田，變幻無定，想起來眞是慨懷萬端。</p>
<p>屏列蒼翠的石山，把柳州圍得緊緊的像一塊大餅，一條奔湃洶湧的柳河，橫穿過這一片心房，流向無盡的遠方，把這城市劃成了南北兩面，今日河南的車水馬龍，早已十倍於昔日的繁榮，河北却依舊冷寂荒涼，頽敗可傷，昔日長不過五百咪而擁有十七家銀行的金融街——培新路，而今除了剛剛新建有十多家商行酒店外，已經是蕭然落索，入夜則燈火昏沉，行人稀少。偶然酒店裏面的絃歌在瓦礫堆裏送過耳來的時候，眞不知是酸還是甜。</p>
<p>標語高揭酒樓　跳舞而且救災</p>
<p>整個城市的精華，集中在河南一隅，這裏我可以說一句，如果除了旅店，酒店，金店，運輸行這四行以外，柳州簡直就不成其為都市，也簡直說不上繁榮的恢復。換一句話也就是說：旅店，酒家，金店，運輸行，重新把柳州「繁榮」了。第一晚我行在河南馬路上，數一數比較像樣的酒店，還不到一半，已經數到了第四十二家，疲倦使我簡直不能再向下繼續數去，不然這倒是一個相當有趣的統計。而且，所有的酒家也是無店不鬥巧，無家不立異，奇奇怪怪的「優待」辦法，說也說不淸。酒店的頂樓上面，「蓬拆蓬拆」的聲音，廣西飢餓，柳州却在跳舞？可笑的是酒家的樓梯口家家掛有救災樂捐箱，孤零零的縮在角落裏，進進出出的人正眼都不望一望。「一食萬金，錢從何處來？」的標語，貼滿了樓梯口的墻壁上，不知錢從何處來的人們仍舊拚命的疏散着鈔票。標語，在他們看得太平常了。</p>
<p>春茍般的旅店　挿遍大街小巷</p>
<p>旅館像春雨後的嫩筍，插滿了大街小巷，可是找一間房子並非易事。記者初到的夜裏，昌着雨，一連跑了八間旅店，才找到一間剛剛遷出別一個旅客的房子。一夜收費二千五百元。這價錢在以金條為交易的上海自然不足為奇可是在廣西却眞的貴到少有了，寫到這裏，推窗四望，樓下的馬路上正熙攘着不知多少為名利奔走的行客，怱忙地來來去去，徒一家旅店路出，又跑進了別一家里易！」</p>
<p>奇怪的是這裏每一家商號的招牌都是一兩個人寫的字，最初我還以為寫字的大槪是甚麼書法家，後來看見寫的字却並不十分高明。一間之餘，原來不是專員，就是縣長的題字，連一家補車胎的小店子也寫着「蕭勁華題」（柳江縣長），商人的好名若渴，於此可見一斑，而且幼稚得可憐。</p>
<p>柳州熱鬧在廣西可算首屈一指，物價大槪也是不敢後人，一場雨後，米價平得多了，這裏還要四萬元左右一担，吃一餐飯，個人起碼要一千五百塊，算一算一個過客每天最少要花六千元。擺在馬路上的一個舊貨攤子裏，有一套不知道是甚麼呢的西服，問一問價錢，是三十萬，無量壽佛，我三個月的薪水還買不到一套西裝！戰爭把甚麼都變了樣，只有物價却像柳江的河水，一天一天的汜濫，一尺一尺的高漲。等到西風起後，春潦過盡，不知又將成甚麼樣子了？</p>
<p>署長向外出巡　職員怡然談笑</p>
<p>救濟總署的廣西分署高在柳州的立魚峯後，樓榭幽淸，流丹飛閣，的是人間天堂。記者也曾跑到門前去景仰仰止一番。黃署長出巡去了，只是幾個西裝畢挺的職員，正站在門口和女朋友談笑，未便攪擾，於是逡巡而退。轉過身來，向難民收容所行去。</p>
<p>救濟分署設在柳州，照道理說，柳州的難民自然是近水樓台先得月，然而照記者的個人看法，這一個「月」也不見得很亮。不過憑良心說，也的確是聯勝於無就是了。</p>
<p>難民收容所在馬鞍山脚下，去救濟分署不過二百步，比起分署的深院來，差得遠了。四五百人分塞在一些美國造的賬蓬下，偶然也有一兩間泥房，方橫不到二丈的房子塞了四十六個人，再加上一些難民的破破爛爛的傢具，十足是一個猪欄，有的低頭補着不能够再補的衣服，有的在捉跳蝨，男女老幼，雜滿一房，湖南話，廣東話，喞喞喳喳的聲音裏，不知包含着多少眼淚！</p>
<p>孩子討到鈔票　磕了一個響頭</p>
<p>能够得到收容的算是萬幸。每夜流浪在街頭的骨瘦如柴的災民，那裏計算得淸楚？一場大災荒，成千累百的災民帶着一顆希望向城市跑，到頭來却是一條一條的生命消失在喧囂的市纏裏，帶著一個失望，投入死神的懷抱。這就是災民的寫照。淋雨蕭風的夜裏，三三五五個寂靜地睡在敗牆斷壁底下，按着空虛的肚皮，聽着酒樓上面悠揚的管絃，我眞不知道他們的心裏這時候是甚麼的感想？唉！</p>
<p>行過小南路的時候，一個小孩子拿着一個鐵罐，追着上來問我要錢。丟了幾百塊錢給他，這小孩子看了一看鈔票，一聲不響的「撲」地就向我磕了一個頭，倒把我嚇了一大跳，速忙把他拉起來，問他爹媽在那裏？他指一指右邊的牆角，又跑回去了。幾百元比起十二兩的救濟麵粉，雖然大槪是並無愧色，但是我却在替自己慚愧，替許多沒有良心的人慚愧。</p>
<p>近水樓台眞正享受月光的不會是難民，相反地，酒家撈到了大批的美國救濟麵粉，做到了名符其實的「精美茶點」。大亨們穿起了救濟而來的西服，卡嘰。有一天我在一家茶樓喝茶，看到雪白的飽點，的確八年未見，不禁問一聲女招待：「這些飽點是不是救濟麵粉做的？」女招待想了一想之後，結果是向我嫣然一笑，腰肢一扭，施施然而去。</p>
<p>還有，最近救濟分署招請大批商車，載運救濟品到各地去。為了署裏的人辦事太大方，把救濟品塞滿汽車後，點也不點，便讓汽車開走。結果，商車的司機老關大揩其油，到了目的地，救濟品少了一半的有，連車子都不見的也有，古怪糊塗，兼而有之，請問這些事情是笑好呢？還是哭好？</p>
<p>文化事業式微　無復蓬勃氣象</p>
<p>文化事業在這裏談不上，疇昔的蓬勃氣象，今天都已是「白頭宮女脫玄宗」的光景了。說報紙，有日報三家：廣西日報的柳州版，官辦，不知道怎樣批評才好。寫到這裏，突然想起了在那一家報紙上曾看過幾句「拿國民黨的錢辦報紙，蓄共產黨說話，笑話笑話」的話，我不願意說廣西日報是這樣的一家報紙，但是應該是怎樣說，却要讓聰明的讀者去想了。此外，有大時代報，言報，前者親共，後者不見得親共。三家報紙就在鬥爭，虧本的氛圍裏一劉站在讀者的面前。另外有晚報一家，三日刋一家，銷路都少得可憐。書店很少，商務印書館在這裏設有支館，其餘的書店大抵有上氣沒下氣的做着半開門的生意。海派的刋物從上海空運而來，銷路極佳，定價三百元的可以賣六百元。上海的報紙，這裏有時候可以看到隔一天的。學校有省立柳州中學，柳莊師範，柳江縣中，和私立的中正，龍城兩中學，廣西大學，以前設在離此不遠的鷓鴣江，現在已經遷往桂林去。</p>
<p>從柳州在廣州　增開航空路綫</p>
<p>說交通，這片心臟自從兩條血管—湘桂黔桂路—被切斷後，比以前要麻痺得多了。昔日宏偉瑰麗的南北車站，今日都已變為陳跡一片。斜陽衰草，相缺無光，雖然湘黔路，一次又一次的說要限甚麼時候恢復，然而機頭，枕木，路軌，處處成問題，談何容易？</p>
<p>最近，聽說柳州到來賓段月底可以通車，但是至今看將起來，恐怕又的點像五日京兆，謙人歡喜的樣子。但願政府早早想法，早早出錢。當柳州的人們又再度看着火龍噴吐着濃重的黑烟，奔馳在這一片盆地上的時候，也使是國家的神氣了。</p>
<p>這兒的公路，上達桂林長沙，下至鬰林湛江，右通宜由貴陽，另路通至邕寗，出越南，相當便利公路局經常有班車行走邕柳桂柳間，舒適便宜，就是路路面壞一點。還要時常担心綠林好漢而已。中航公司每星期四有班機自此飛渝，最近並增闢從柳州到廣州的航綫，票價兩萬六千塊。</p>
<p>氣候的激烈變化，是柳州的一特徵，早上太陽出來，穿一件單衣，一場雨後，多少人却趕緊把大衣披在身上，太陽一出，又趕着脫衣裳，光是穿衣裳，脫衣裳，就把人忙够了。（寄自柳州桂豐酒店）</p>
<h3 id="c131">滇西樂土　風花雪月 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 大理三日航訊　蓁君</p>
<p>一位住在雲南八年的下江老鄕，體重有兩百磅，如果問他何時回去，他的回答是：鬆鬆肩膀地說：「雲南氣侯太好了。上海勢得吃不消，不想回去」，眞的，雲南省是中國，也許是全世界氣侯最好的地方，前年盟友們從印度越過吉馬拉亞山駝峯昆明來，下了飛機就說：「中國比印度，要好到百分之一百。」昆明凉爽的氣侯，給他一個特好的印象，我們的國際地位，無形中提高了不少。</p>
<p>「不到昆明，不知道中國有如此好的地方，不到大理，不知道雲南省有如此好的地方。」這是黨國元老，張溥泉先生最近游滇的名言。</p>
<p>「大理」是指南至下關，北至上關，東依蒼山，西濱洱海，這一塊不規則的長方形而說的，他的面積約一百八十方里，氣侯溫暖，物產豐富。此地有滄山的紅雲白雪的碧水靑天，以及城廓樓台田舍漁村，名花異石，古寺塔影，眞是滇西的一片樂土。</p>
<p>讓我們來談談大理的風，花·雪·月吧。</p>
<p>風</p>
<p>「下關的風」，下關是滇西最著名的市鎭，滇西四十多縣及五六個設治局的貨物，都在下關集散，雲南人說：「堆不滿的下關，」下關分關迤，關外·在玉龍關之北是大理縣屬，關南是鳳儀縣屬，兩個縣分這一個市鎭，大街鳳儀屬，非常熱鬧，中中交農四大銀行，以及滇省各銀行都設分行在此·旅館·戲園·建築得相當好，估宗人（西藏人）到此也當看作上海了。</p>
<p>下關的風自從那裏來的？從兩方面來說：其一；洱海的水被蒸發向上昇，遇到很高的蒼山寒流，就變成大風，散不出去，（因為洱海四面皆山）。所以一到秋冬，說不定一天吹幾次巨風，其二：在下關的西南，有一條狹長的山谷，滇西公路循此山谷而經漾濞到保山，這一條山谷有八十華里長，兩旁是高山，寬度不到一華里。空氣受了高山的壓制，迫着向下關吹來，下江人說：「吹來的弄堂風一」。以上是風的來源，據下關人說：有風洞發風出來，不過是神話罷了。</p>
<p>風對於下關人，並不可怕，風吹散了污濁的空氣，風吹散了塵灰和虛土，風吹得天氣分外淸朗，人們覺得適宜，風雖然時常吹，天氣並不寒冷，下關人驕傲地說：「風吹去了下關人的病，也洗凈了下關鎭」。</p>
<p>花</p>
<p>「大理的花」，大理縣城，有杭州似的美麗，蘇州似的甜靜，常州似的樸實，南京似的雄偉，坐在家裏，可以看到蒼山洱海，最使人羨慕的是，每家門口有一條蒼山下來的活水，淸潔而便利，這是我們下江人享不到的福。</p>
<p>講起大理的花，先賢江陰人徐霞客先生曾記載過：「趨三塔寺山麗……泉上大樹，當四月初節，發花如蝴蝶，鬚翅栩然，與生蝶蝶無異，又有眞蝶千萬連鬚鈎足。自樹嶺倒懸而下及於泉面繽紛繹五色煥然」。</p>
<p>可惜我們不能見到如此好看的花，據土人說：大理人討厭各地人來看此花，把他砍掉了，如今樹根還在，我們現在所看到的花是：山茶。牡丹·等等每當春的，尤其在「三月街」，家家拏出所養的花來，相互鬥妍，山茶紅似落日，牡丹大如銀盆，記者並無半點虛構，雲南的氣候，適於蒔花，這是最大的原因。</p>
<p>雪</p>
<p>「蒼山的雪」，「蒼山十九峯，峯峯見雪」，的確無論在春夏秋冬四季，蒼山最高峯總是有雪的，如果夜晚稍微下一點小雨，天明就峯峯有雪了，蒼山拔海有三千公尺以上的高度，最高峯已頂到天空中的「永雪帶」，所以終年積雪的，我們在鳳儀縣境看山，好像一個高人，戴了白色雨笠，巍巍峨峨的坐着，如果在他背後漾濞縣境望過來，那幽鬰的松林，披上一張白氈，所以漾濞東城門，稱曰「雪映門」，十分風趣，雪映在人的心裏，能發出，純潔，嚴肅，冷靜，飄逸，雖然蒼山頂上積雪，底下人家只穿着薄薄的衣服，還向到暖和的太陽，這不是奇事嗎？</p>
<p>土人傳說唐朝大將李宓南征，雖以捷聞朝庭，後因接濟困難，廿萬人，都死於此役，每到天陰，卽聞人馬嘶喊聲，後來明南征大將鄧子龍嘗克敵過此，造了一個萬人塜，以紀念李將軍的功績，並且做首詩：「唐將南征以捷聞，誰憐枯骨風黃昏，唯有蒼山公道雪；年年披白弔忠魂」，以後就不再聽到人馬嘶喊聲了，「白雪弔忠魂」，給我們漢人做永久的紀念。</p>
<p>月</p>
<p>「洱海的月」，洱海是狹長的一個湖藻，雲南人沒有見過海，所以把湖當作海了，這也難怪他們少見多快，因為西南高原，少見湖藻地區，如果要描寫河海的風景，我記得一張宗敎畫，「耶穌在加利利海邊講道」，海水碧綠，山色土紅，帶着沉毅和幽靜的色彩，想起猶大的加利利海，差不多和洱海一般的面積吧？</p>
<p>洱海的月，好在什麼呢？因為下關的風大，把天空的雲吹得一絲不留，所以月色分外明亮，加上水色的淸明，反映於月亮底下，照如白晝，這還不算好，如在陰曆每月十六·十七·十八·三天傍晚月兔東昇的時光，月亮大如車輪，在東山慢慢底升上來，由紅而黃，到發白，洱海的水色由黑而灰，到發銀白色，短短的十五分鐘，給你意外的奇境，這是世界最美麗的月亮。</p>
<p>記者在月下待徊於聖麓峯下的聖麓公園前面，對着洱海，白牆上寫的：「不能保衛大西南是遠征軍的恥辱」，這幾個字還留着，抗戰勝利，政府還都了，我們仍在滇西，又想到，西湖的月，黃浦江上的月，蘇州黃天蕩的月，無錫太湖的月，同時這一個月吧！</p>
<p>一枝禿筆，寫不盡這風花雪月，不知道現在久居上海鬧市的人們，也有此雅興來領略這塊樂土的風光否？</p>

<p>編輯先生：請貴報賜我一角地，將這封信披露，讓老百姓說幾句公道話，將這憂鬰已久的氣吐出來，使那掛羊頭賣狗肉以民主為幌子而實行為黨派少數人自私自利陞官發財為目的之輩，猶知民言可畏，而檢點其害國家害民族的行為罷。在抗戰期間，我們老百姓家破人亡，妻離子散，含辛如苦，始終協助政府堅持抗戰，以期勝利後使國家得到自由平等獨立，我們老百姓得到安居樂業。有志者事竟成，八年緊苦抗戰，勝利終由軍民血汗換來。我們老百姓是如何的歡欣，如何的鼓舞，從此我們可以安居，可以樂業，夫妻可以團圓，父子可以歡聚，以及我們為國家抗戰而犧牲的親戚朋友，亦可含笑於九泉。殊不知才大謬不然，强盜雖已打走，而家裏又內鬨起來。此地烽火剛熄，那裏刁斗又起。於是政府召集黨派諸公地方賢達，協談會商，共謀國事，以期建設一個現代民主富强康樂的國家，並請美國馬歇爾將軍前來調解紛爭。政協會條件談妥了，停戰執行小組發出了，馬將軍回去了，我們老百姓的失望悲觀又變為興奮愉快起來了。但是不久東北戰事暴發，魯察熱綏各省繼之而起，以致無數同胞流離失所，轉死溝壑，為槍砲犧牲者，尤不在少數。交通不復，物價高漲，工廠停閉，生產落寞，這裏在罷工，那裏在請假，經濟破產，民不聊生。官吏不足以養廉，貪污之風日熾；將士不能回家，盜賊之行時有。復員旣無辦法，建國又成問題。國勢無危，一髪千鉤！凡有良心，莫不痛哭。馬歇爾將軍又來了，各黨派賢達當道諸公又飛來飛去，以謀恢復其談判工作。殊不知七日停戰令方始發出，而十一日東北衝突又起，一方面在談，一方面在打。考其原因，皆由於各有各的立塲，各有各的背景，你在焉甲講話，我在為乙奔走，同床異夢，不以國家民族利益為前提，以致愈講愈遠，愈商愈糟。故鄕間最近發現一種歌謠云：「公說公有理，婆說婆有理，公有理，婆有理，惟有老百姓莫有理。姓莫有理。你民主，我民主，國家愈民主，老百姓愈痛苦。」諸公應知道，爾俸爾祿，民脂民膏。你們所坐的洋房，所吃的大菜，所坐的飛機，還是取之於民。國以民為本，民以食為天，雖古專制時代，猶顯念人民，値茲民主，其對人民又將如何？諸公！你們在快樂，我們老百姓在痛哭。你們在大吃大喝，我們老百姓在絕衣絕食。在這談判進行當中，個人以代表無黨無派眞正純潔的老百姓，主張幾點，以作諸公參攷：（一）國家土地必須完整，主權必須獨立。（二）惟有國家合法政府，才能代表國家，行使當前國家一切應有職權。（三）應以人民至上，民生第一，不要以黨派至上，黨利第一。（四）眞正民主政治，應由國民會議制定憲法，產生合法政府，不要憑藉槍桿，而要憑藉民意。（五）應先組織民主政治考察團，到蘇聯考察其是否民主，英美各國民主如何，方不致失之皮毛，將此善良政治制度敗壞無遺。惟有實中踐上述主張，才能開誠佈公，團結一致。惟有實踐上述主張，才能實現眞正民主政治，建設未來的新中國，倘仍踏前轍，不以國家民族利益為前提，國家危亡，諸公危亡，諸公有何好處？縱能免人民制裁，亦不能免歷史唾駡！諸公以為何如？讀者張達權上。</p>
<p>痛苦的反應</p>
<p>編輯先生：在勝利後的十個月當中，蘇北的難胞，寄呈收復區各大報章，以及有關當局的請求呼籲的，這一類文字，也不能算不吧，但是果眞能够收有成效的究有多少？現在的我認為是「哀求」「呼救」已經非其時了。流亡的同胞們！請　：社會是那樣的混濁，現實是多麼的矛盾，「談談打打談談」，官塲是在演戲，「聯　政府　　　，」黨派是在爭奪，有誰來同情我們？有誰來憐憫我們？世間所給與我們的是白眼，沉寂。我們簡直是國家的流民，社會的棄者。我們要什麼救濟，我們求什麼撫輯？遲早都是死日。我們不得不向政府請領槍枝，自動打向老家。我們要做鎭江晋京請願的二千代表的後援者，我們要迎頭趕上徐海（千餘人）武裝還鄕的前進者。我們再也不能遲疑了，我們立刻號召團結。我們沒有絲毫政見，我們為了生存，要和惡魔作殊死點。我們絕不是血氣之勇，完全是事實所驅使而不得不如此。編輯先生，我的話也說得太過火了。不過要講——曲予原諒，這純粹是痛苦反應的表現。讀者沈紹生謹上，六，十一。</p>
<p>社會同情那裏去了？</p>
<p>編者先生：我昨天看到貴報讀者意見欄內一篇流亡羣的呼聲，當下極為感動，竟至眼臉沾濕。我是和作者具有同樣情形的人。所差別的，是作者還能在復大讀書，而我是一個失學的高中畢業生罷了。我流亡到江南來已經幾個月了，在其間，輾轉在鎭江，蘇州，上海，杭州飄流。致全力想獲得一份工作，維持暫時免於饑餓的最低生活，可是在這人多於事的現在，若干有學問有經騐的人尚且找不到工作，何况初出茅廬的小子？讀書是根本不敢妄想的。起先，用的是帶出來的錢，以後是向熟人小數借借，最後則是飄流了。捱飢受餓是常事，水門汀和廟堂是晚上的老朋友。我曾向各方呼籲，人家答以白眼。更曾向救濟機關登記申請救濟登記表格不知塡多少次了，結果是等候書面通知，石沉大海了！，國家是擯棄了我們！踢出了我們這批大槪是廢物的於社會之外！請社會上的大人先生們，你們不要忽視，莫不關心，以為是與已無關。知識靑年的失業，是要增加社會的不安寧的，投身入共黨，是要增加局勢的嚴重的。社會混亂，局勢惡化，要影響到你們的地位與財產的安全保障的！同時，希望政府健全救濟織織，加强救濟力量，不要再是有名無實及惠入經手人之手的東西，而是能力切當的人盡其才的使流亡靑年得復學就業的機關才是。否則，「逼反」的責任應由逼者去担任而與被逼的是無涉的。先生，富有正義感的人是不會以我的話為逼激的吧！郭修謹上。六月十日。</p>
<h3 id="c134">沉寂了的華西壩 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 成都五日航訊　郭鴻</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，華西壩是一直被人艷羨為「世外桃源」的；而在目前，久處內地的人們，雖然有不少的正欄往於收復區中的繁華的上海，冠蓋雲集的首都，古典風的北平，雅凈整潔的靑島及廣州武漢等地，但當內戰的火燄正到處延燒，物價普遍猛漲的惡劣情况下，在某種意味上說來，華西壩仍然是「世外桃源」的似。</p>
<p>「桃源」現狀</p>
<p>華西壩是一個「壩子」，—在「壩」這一字的習慣應用上，川省人與江浙人之間是大有差別的：在後者，「壩」往往指的是「河堤」，而在前者則指的是「塲地」了。—它位落於成都市區的南面，一出新南門，不上五百步便可到達，所以它和市區可說是毘連着的。</p>
<p>人們一進壩上，那就立刻會感到置身在另一個環境之中了，除去砌着石子或煤屑的人行道而外，那就很少有所謂「中國風味」。首先躍進你的限簾的，便是那些一蹲蹲的大樓，它的屋瓦蓋作宮殿式，樓的四周開着一排排的玻璃窗，在下邊的進門處，砌着寬大的石階，石階下面便是一塊草坪；四圍還有繞欄的走廊：顯出一付雄偉的氣象。在人行道和隙地上，則遍種着樹木，春夏之際，綠蔭一片，且雜以粉紅淺紫的花朶，越覺幽美動人了。</p>
<p>整個的壩約有二分之一的平方華里，全部都是華西大學的校址。學校的各項設備極為完善，博物樓，理化樓，圖書館等等，無不應有盡有。還有一所高聳的塔尖形的建築，那是「鐘樓」，按時報告標準時間；當它噹噹地響起之時，可聲聞一里。里面還有二所草坪—也就是運動塲，小的一所足可容納數千人，大的一所則較前者更要大出一倍有餘。此外還有一所規模宏大的醫院，一家銀行的辦事處，以及應運而生的各種小吃店等等。</p>
<p>但令人慚愧的是，這是塊樂園不是由於已力所創造，而是藉了基督敎會之所賜吧了。</p>
<p>學子大镕爐</p>
<p>戰前，壩上原有的大學生不過數百人，而且十之九以上是川籍人士；但在戰後，燕京，齊魯，金陵各大學，金陵女子文理學院等四校相繼遷來，於是學生的籍貫則是包羅全國任何省市了，名之曰「各省學子的大镕爐」，那是決非過甚其詞的。不但此也，除外尚有數位英美法籍的少男少女點綴其間，更値得一提的便是這位印度小姐，她的膚色，服裝，是最惹內地人士所注意的了。</p>
<p>傷心話學風</p>
<p>筆者曾在壩上躭過一個學期，對於這裏學生的風氣，生活情况還不太陌生。有一位在民國廿年左右畢業於華大的朋友曾感慨地向我說過：「我們在讀書時，課餘的時間大都是在運動塲上，或是閱讀一般書籍，可是現在的學生，哼！」我知道朋友的這一「哼」是代表什麼的。一般說來，壩上的讀書風氣是不大好的，據筆者觀察的結果，那遠比少磁器的學生差，而奢糜的生活則遠過之。其原因何生，那該是說來話說，似不必在這裏擅下結論，但學生們的家庭經濟富裕是佔着一個副要的因素的。談戀愛是他們的家常便飯；跳舞更是日常的消遣，在此間一些私人公館中所舉行的跳舞上，主要的客人便是這些公子小姐。再不然，便是成羣結隊的看好萊塢的軟性影片，而大都又只能作直覺的感受，缺乏鑒賞與批判的能力；上茶館的風氣尤為盛行，常常四五個人圍在一起，翹起脚，抽着烟，大玩「橋」戲，那種神氣實在令人側目，當有一個時期，盟軍雲集成都的時候，一些女學生的放蕩行為喧傳衆口；雖頗受市民的歧視和輿論界的指摘，但並未稍形歛跡；其中有的固然是自甘墜落，有的則因經濟來源不易而被迫出此，但這總是同樣可痛心的，</p>
<p>各校復員了</p>
<p>隨着勝利的來臨，內遷內校紛紛復員。燕大，齊大，金大，金女大的本期課程都在四月中旬即告結束；作為地主的華大，因為其所聘之敎授暨課程與各校有着交互關係，所以也在五月初放假了。</p>
<p>復員最早的是金女大和金男大，第一批師生均於四月底前首途赴京。前者目下已全部完成後者亦可於五月底前各竣。其次是燕大，五月上旬開出了首批復員事，以後又陸續駛出兩批，在六月中可望結束。最為遲遲其行也最感困難的便是齊大了，目下的山東是中國混亂局面最嚴重的一省，赴濟南的交通問題能否解決實在是渺茫得很。該校在五月中旬雖開出了一輛復員車，但不是去濟南的，而是運送一部份平津籍的師生回鄕。大部份的師生仍留下在成都，彼等何日啓行，尚未決定，但校當局已頒佈了一個規定，那就是在九月二十日之前必須往濟南校方報到。但願這些從敵人的火綫中脫逃出來的靑年學子，不要又蹈入自己人的火綫之中了。</p>
<p>壩上的沈寂</p>
<p>一個黃昏，筆者特地去到壩上作了一次巡禮。一切的景色依然如舊，但是年靑人的蹝跡稀少了，通明的燈火減滅了，各個壁報欄東倒西歪的，上面僅剩着一點殘蹟。有幾家小吃店是歇業了。在「對牛彈」（華大的音樂實習室）那裏，平日是不斷的響着叮咚的鋼琴聲，和要着花腔的女高音的玉潤珠的歌喉，現在都闐然無聞了。</p>
<p>在暮靄蒼茫中，我徘徊在一條闊廣而寥寂的人行道上；晚風吹着高大的綠楊，在我頭上蕭蕭作響；一陣瑟縮之感襲上了我，不禁打了一個寒顫。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>京戲裏常常有「小人有罪，不敢抬頭」的說白，為什麼不敢抬頭，一言以蔽之，「不見得人」也。</p>
<p>昨天糧貨案中任星崖和邵季高兩人被收押時，攝影記者追踪着紛紛攝影，而任邵二人却各以報紙一張遮着面孔，目的何在，怕「丟臉」！</p>
<p>這一類事，原很尋常，我們做新聞記者的人，不時會遭遇到轉灣抹角的請托，諸如「新聞不妨照登，照片務請留情，」所謂體面大，大概在此等處特別可顯示出它的價値來。不然，監獄總不見得沒有屋頂天花板罷，為什麼那批漢奸們還需要美國太陽眼鏡呢？（見十八日本版「新聞小天地」）</p>
<p>我們大家都知道，人死了後，未收殮之前，習俗都在他的臉上蒙上一張紙，有的說，這是為了怕其牠動物走過，死人感應到氣息，會屍變而成走屍；還有一種說法，那就是死人面孔難看，會令他的家族—生人起醜惡恐怖的念頭，而減少悲痛的情緒。在我想，後一種說法比較入情近理，科學一點，而俗語的「死要臉，」其根據大槪在此。</p>
<p>記得在日本，被判處死刑的犯人，整個頭部是套在一隻竹簍裏的，用意呀亦如此；這比起我們要遊街示衆來，似乎寬厚一點。其實，法原有以示衆之意，綁赴法塲之前，大碗酒大塊肉，講個實惠，顧全那一霎那的面孔，眞是想不開。馬太福音廿三章廿五節上說：</p>

<h3 id="c139">飲咖啡 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 方君</p>
<p>是日下午，還不到三點鐘，我和比我年靑的後叔走進一家大建築的地窖裏，揀上「聰明人」靠左的一個沙發座，各人要了一杯咖啡，—我三年多來第一次嘗到它了。</p>
<p>以前雖然在饑餓上徘徊，在戰爭當中能吃飽的時候可以說沒曾有過，但對於咖啡還是常常有得到嘴的。第一固然是自己喜歡，其次是朋友常常請吃。朋友請吃自己不用花錢，自己喜歡便要從口糧上面省下三個銅子來了。（馬路旁以前三個銅子一杯的咖啡）。雖則比不上朋友請吃的來得可口，却也慰情聊勝於無，也總好過「過屠門而大嚼」吧。</p>
<p>不想咖啡也會絕了「種」，給拿炒黑豆粉冒充，飲起來又苦又澀，簡直和飲「王老吉」苦茶沒有異樣。而且「聰明人」又換了招牌，到那兒去說不定還要擔上些驚恐。我因此對那地方疏遠了好幾年，其實呢，在不知死所的地方去把殘喘茍延，想飲咖啡的念頭也不由得你去轉一下了。</p>
<p>咖啡的本質當然是苦的，在以前，好多年的以前，我流浪在上海的神秘之街的時期，就常常去喝苦咖啡，要從它的苦澀之中領略到人生的滋味，但炒黑豆粉沒有這種苦澀的雋永的，猶之「王老吉」的苦茶，你却不能嘗到如咖啡中的苦澀。所以，我當時就像徵此味是咖啡，也惟有喝咖啡的人才能領略到人生的眞趣。因此，我就以為人生的眞趣咖啡可以象徵，而咖啡便成了都市文化的產物了。</p>
<p>不幸我對於咖啡有好幾年的絕緣，而人也就被投擲到一個深淵，冰窖去，幾乎不得超生。</p>
<p>今日它又和我結緣，總算是世界人道與公理得到伸張，敎我困在黑暗裏的人見到了國旗，見到了天日！於是我對於那位穿白衣黑褲而紥着褲管的　甌送來的那杯咖啡特別的珍視了。</p>
<p>對咖啡—擺在我的面前的那杯咖啡，我出神了，眼望着，凝眼的望着，喜愛着，心裏孜孜地喜愛着，面上展出我多年未曾展過的笑容，蒼老枯瘦的臉皮，嘴角祗這麼掛着的一圈，便可以現出我衷懷是如何地快慰了。我忘了行，我的心，口和眼睛實然祇有在面前那杯咖啡的上面。</p>
<p>咖啡提起了我病裏的精神，也充沛了我病裏的體力，在我飲了那杯咖啡的時候。</p>
<p>我似乎已不是在病中了，當我飲完了那杯咖啡。</p>
<p>我奇怪起來，對咖啡的空杯閃出懷疑的眼光，但顯然我是因它而有了奕奕的神氣。</p>
<p>但我的病是不會好的，一杯咖啡怎能醫得我的病來，祇是故友重逢，鬰結了好久的心情給打開些罷了。</p>
<p>我打算再來一杯，然而我的從叔却偏要我用些「西餅」。</p>
<p>我不能推却，啃了一口蛋糕，蛋糕的軟嫩香甜，可說另是一種人生的况味。</p>
<p>不過，蛋糕這種人生的况味我是不必去理解的，同時也不想去理解。因為，蛋糕般的人生我是過去了，而且，很早就過去了，現在的，原祇有「王老吉」般的人生，却想從「王老吉」裏再嘗一嘗咖啡底苦澀的雋永的滋味</p>
<p>我終於又要了一杯咖啡，人立刻是悠悠然，甚麼也忘記了</p>
<p>註：此文作者在香港，「聰明人」係香港德輔道中一咖啡店名。「王老吉」為廣東一種涼茶，有去積食作用。</p>

<p>為了報復女子的不貞，或堅拒自己的愛意，年老的男人，往往謀殺這個女子，以洩胸中之忿。而年輕的情殺犯，所謀殺的却多數是他的情敵，大半起因於爭辯時言語上的侮辱。</p>
<p>這是美國伊利諾大學的柏路博士及福克斯博士，在五年中，研究了二百個情殺犯所獲得的結論。</p>
<p>在南密歇根州監獄中，情殺犯的平均年齡，比一般囚犯的平均年齡為高，前者為三十四歲，後者不過二十九歲多些，情殺犯的敎育程度及智力都很低。</p>
<p>老年人因情妬而行兇，比因其他動機行兇，來得更粗暴；靑年的情殺犯正相反。</p>
<h3 id="c142">犧牲品 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>商店大傾銷，在舉行廉價，减價時期，照例要先幾種貨物，標上價籤，寫出「犧牲品」的字樣。</p>
<p>犧牲品，這名詞是多麼刺激人。所謂犧牲，意思是這一類貨品，售價不到本錢，是特地選出來優待顧客的。因此，每一個人看見了櫥窗裏有犧牲品，總得逗住步子，看個究竟，如果這東西果眞便宜而好派用塲，會不自主地進去購買。</p>
<p>我買東西，自認是個精功朋友。有時需要一種貨物，會跑他幾家，對櫥窗中不住看望，究竟那一家便宜。所謂「貨比三家不吃虧」，我認為是購貨的原則。因此，對於犧牲品，也曾嘗試過幾次。可是結果，使我對之漸漸不够刺激，不予信任。到現在更確認凡是犧牲品都不是便宜貨了。</p>
<p>我之所以對犧牲品冷淡到不屑看一眼，當然並非無因。以往去買犧牲品，每多不勝擠軋之苦，有些店家，去　　　一步，會回報你時間已過，明日　　。有些店　，對面前　的一簇顧客，作勢嚴監，慢慢地授出來，還揀熟人授。時間一過，或東西完了，來個明天會，白軋了半天，啞子吃黃蓮，無訴苦處。</p>
<p>就算有時可以購到。牙膏結了塊，襪子脫了色，衣料有壞洞，食品有氣味……一切的一切，是有些腐壞，不能作好貨賣，而作為犧牲品的，這種東西，買來何用？價雖便宜，實際是上當。但上當至多一二次，過後對犧牲品，自然會冷淡而不去上當了。</p>
<p>想買便宜貨的人，本來壓根兒是蠢虫。開店的人誰不要賺錢。而肯蝕本。你想法買連本錢都不到的東西，出發點就錯誤。否則那些大老闆何來洋房汽車？</p>
<p>由犧牲品而推想到大减價，大拍賣，眞正减價的貨品，能有多少？其中也多半是次貨。衣料的加三或買一尺送一尺者，和不加不送的，是否價目相同？曾經看見幾家商店，終年半開着，貼滿紅綠紙條，舉行關店大拍賣，可是關了七八年，還沒有關掉。好吧，這一切，都是商人的噱頭，否則豈能號召許多顧客上門？犧牲是有代價的，犧牲商品也是這樣。</p>

<p>— 鮑鍾祺</p>
<p>朱少屏先生在菲律賓領事任內慘遭日寇殺害了，他的死亡是在民國三十一年四月十七日，直到最近方才證實，他是被敵寇威迫，自掘墳墓後實行活埋的。同時，本市各界也在浦東同鄕會舉行了朱少屏先生追悼會，於是，這一代敎育學家遂長逝下了。</p>
<p>我的得識朱少屏先生，是在寰球小學的時候，那時他正蟄居在上海，負責寰球學生會的進行，並兼任寰球小學的校長。他一生力於敎育事業及新聞事業，歷任啓秀女中的董事長；革命的時候，他是「南社」的發起人創導者，柳亞子以下恐怕就要論到他了。對於宣傳革命的工作曾經盡了最大的努力，在「五四」學生運動時，他更親自率領了同學奔走呼籲，甚至於寢食不顧，痛哭流涕，他的精神影響我們很多，對於國家的貢獻可說極大，不幸菲島為日軍攻陷，這偉大的老人也終於為國殉難了。</p>
<p>他生前對於辦敎育認眞而不茍且，雖然極些徵的事情，他都認眞料理，不肯忽略。譬如說，他每天早晨必定親自到廁所中去視察，同學們往往笑他，但是，他仍舊非常認眞地作為每天早晨的例行公事。凡是沒有把馬桶蓋放好的，或者牆壁上塗滿了無聊的字盡，那麼他在紀念週上就要大發議論了。</p>
<p>說起紀念週，使我聯想起一件趣事。他的本鄕口昔很重，所以「諸位」二字往往可以錯聽成為「粢飯」。有一次他在紀念週上感慨說：「中國人往往貧窮得連早粥也吃不起」，接着他就想在同學中獲得證明。果然一個同學以極眞誠的口氣回答說：「粢飯的確是這樣：」台下哄堂大笑，而他却很正經地說：「這眞是不幸的事，你們怎樣還可笑呢？」可見他的忠實之處。那時候，朱先生的年齡已相當高，童山濯濯，燈光之下，非常煇煌，同學們戲稱之為「電燈泡」，他也絕不生氣。</p>

<p>本市四月份進口貨，超過輸出的土貨達二十倍，在戰後國內物資萬分缺乏的今日，倒是一種好現象，因為一面拚命拖進來，一面留着不出去，物資才有充裕希望，正合乎「開源節流」原則，何必作杞人之憂。</p>

<p>— 靖華</p>
<p>上海人每歡喜稱年靑的人為小開，同時他們也頗樂意接受。不論眞小開抑假小開，充滿着虛榮心的他們，覺得惟有這稱呼，繼能表示他們高貴的身份，於是虛榮瀰漫的上海，東小也開，西也小開。</p>
<p>乞丐們的呌幾聲小開，引起了這班小開們高興，也許會賞你一張百元票。酒館·茶室的侍者呌幾聲小開，換得的是更多的小賬。</p>
<p>可是所謂小開者；一班眞小開們，他們依仗着家長的產業，不務正業，呼朋引類的買醉歡塲，終宵裏花天酒地，揮霍成性，他們不知道賺錢的困難，他們只有消費，不會生產，這班國家的敗類，社會的蠢蟲，家庭的寄生蟲，就是所謂小開。</p>
<p>尤其可憐的是一班假小開們，他們大都是公司或商店的小職員，結識了這班眞小開們。在歡塲中，有人稱他小開，尤其是心愛的女人，他高興得忘了自己的身份，他需要保持小開的尊貴，來博得美人的歡心。華貴的服飾，闊綽的排塲，是小開們必備的條件，可是區區勉以糊口的薪水，怎能再供他的揮霍？未到月底薪水已預支一空，「死要面子活受罪」，先是東借西挪，接着是典當抵賣，最後或許在可能中來上一齣捲逃的活劇。</p>
<p>小開，小開這是一個多麼卑鄙，多麼可羞恥的名詞呀！</p>

<p>— 危會</p>
<p>記得在幾個月前教育部長朱家驊初到上海的時候有一部份學生遊行請願，大聲的喊着口號：「我們要讀書！」我們覺得在這個時代還有人喊着要讀書，這實在是難能可貴。老實說，這年頭想讀書的人實在太少了。「讀書人」在中國成了一種特殊階級，這涵意似乎是說中國人可以分成兩類：讀書人與不讀書人。說起來也可憐，現在連「讀書人」也不讀書了。學生該是讀書的，可是以現在的大學生而論，我們要請問有幾個是在讀書的？以前的大學生讀敎科書之外還看點參考書，後來祗讀敎科書，現在連敎科書也不看了。大學敎授該是讀書的吧！可是據我所知現在大學敎書，還繼續看書的恐怕也是鳳毛麟角了，剛出來敎書的還翻些參考書預備講義，老敎育家們捧着二十年前自已留學時的筆記成功了權威，再讀書似乎是無用了。其他，至於商人是沒有讀書的工夫，工人是沒有讀書的力量，而一般政客要人們有着比讀書更要緊的事體，所以也就無暇及此了。</p>
<p>所幸的，在上海還有兩種人在讀書。一種是有閒階級的太太小姐和公司機關的職員們。太太們不願意管孩子們，因爲要看書；職員們也因爲在讀書而暫時不能不放棄他們的職務。原來他們都在發憤忘食的閱讀黃色新聞的週報啊！還有一種讀書人就是一般天眞的小朋友們，他們放學之後還不願意回家，把吃糖的錢省下來，坐在馬路旁的書攤上，看速環圖畫。這是他們唯一的精神糧食。</p>
<p>我們常聽到一般前進的敎育家們高喊着：「打倒書本敎育！」他們已經成功了。新敎育家萬歲！</p>
<h3 id="c151">家庭與民法 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 潘光旦</p>
<p>…趙鳳喈民法親屬編評介…</p>
<p>十多年來，對於民法親屬一編做過專書的作家很不少；余棨昌，徐朝陽，郁嶷，黃右昌，陶彙曾，曹傑，胡長淸，鍾洪聲諸氏的作品，都是抗戰以前或抗戰初期問世的。抗戰期間寫成而最近才問世的又有趙鳳喈氏的民法親屬編一種，由國立編譯館出版，正中書局印行。</p>
<p>本書的結構大體上和其它的同類的作品相似，即，大都根據民法親屬一編的章節條欵的順序，分別討論或評議。全書分緒論與本論兩部分，本論部分又分爲通則，家，婚姻，父母子女，監護，扶養親屬會議等七章，章各若干節；末附錄兩種，一是國民黨中央政治會議通過的親屬法先决各點審查意見書，二是民法親屬編解釋例。</p>
<p>比較以前各家的著論來，本書有許多値得提出的特點。從評介者的立塲說，至少也有幾點應當鄭重的介紹給讀者。</p>
<p>一·家庭是社會生活的重心</p>
<p>作者對於家庭的制度能作充分的注意，而無畸重畸輕之　，是很可以稱道的。家庭是社會生活的出發點，亦是社會生活的重心所寄，甚至於是社會生活的眞正的單位，無論從上下數萬年的人類經騐言之或從百餘年來孔德以降的比較科學的社會學說言之，都不妨說是已成一種定論。乃民法親屬編的制定人不察一面鑒於中國過去家制的畸形發展，一面惑於當代一部分的思潮，因噎廢食，將『家』的一章列在第六，位置且在『監護』與『扶養』之後，對於家制的規定，亦不過寥寥的幾條。作者認爲這是一種根本的錯誤，非矯正不可，所以在討論的次序裏，把『家』從第六位提到第二位，緊隨通則一章之後，並且在篇首例言的第一項裏即加以說明說，『我民法上之『家』旣以親屬共同生活之團體爲原則，自應從歷次民草之例，將其置於「婚姻』與『父母子女』之上；况依社會學家之推論，亦認婚姻起源於家族，不能謂家族起源於婚姻。故本書將「家一列爲第二章」。</p>
<p>這種維護健全家制的精神，作者在全書中是一貫的維持的。例如他對於離婚的看法，主張不過於限制，也不過於自由；他說『若離婚過於自由，則社會與家庭亦無安密之日；故爲鞏固家庭，以求下代民族之健康計，應力謀其事件之減少」（頁一〇七）。又如，獨身男子收養女子，民法親屬篇無明文規定，前此法學家如胡長淸氏主張可以收養，而作者則認爲原上則應加禁止，遇有特殊情形，可由法院加以可决。此層表面上不關宏詣，實際上則影響甚大。獨身者的增多大半爲當代家制無由健全之因，小半亦爲家制不健全之果。「內無怨女，外無曠夫』的原則雖若陳舊，而婚姻生活實爲人格健全與社會安定的一大條件，則未始非近代社會學的一種結論，且有統計數字可資證明。所以要維特家庭的健全，獨身的風氣不能不同時有所糾正，此其一。能力與興趣上足以收養別人的女兒爲女兒的人事實上決不是根本不宜於結婚的人，收養的原則上的禁止多少可以收一些減少獨身傾向的效果，因爲如果垂老的男子不能作收養的企圖，則當其壯年的時候，不能不作一些結婚與成家的打算；此其二。獨身男子垂老而作收養他人子女之計，貌似成一有父有女的家庭，而實則不是眞正的家庭，眞僞之間，有不容不　者在；此其三。老男少女獨處一室，名爲父女，實同夫婦，就社會道德與秩序言之，法律也不能不負一些防微杜漸的責任。胡長淸氏對此作肯定之說，認爲民法旣已明定收養者的年齡應長於被收養者二十歲以上，則通常即無發生性的關係或婚姻關係的可能。這未免是一種但知法理而不識生理的迂闊的議論。作者於此曾作駁論，所見極是（頁一六七）。評介者還可以進一步的說，老男少女的發生性關係，不但可能，並且容易，男子當五十上下是性生理的一大關口，娶小妻，通婢僕，捧女角，收乾女兒，以至於强姦幼女一類的行爲大都在這關口裏發生。然則，此種年齡以內的男子名爲收養，安知其不別有企圖？或雖眞心收養於先，又安保其不改變關係於後？多一個改變的例子，即整個的家庭制度多受一分剝蝕與動搖；此其四。</p>
<p>又如作者討論到未成年人的監護問題的時候，主張除父母爲當然監護人而外，法定監護人的地位應該在遺囑監護人之先，因法定監護人終究是一家的人，而遺囑監護人是家以外的人；他說，我國與其它國家的情形不同，『大家庭徧存於農村社會，即都市中亦不盡爲小家庭，家政常統於一家中長輩之身；父母一旦亡故，親權則由爲家長之祖父母或伯叔父母代爲行使，已成慣例。設使後死之父或母指定外人爲其子女之監護人，則親權與家長　不無衝突，且一室之中親疎相間，骨肉情乖，甚非家庭之之福』</p>
<p>二·家庭的重心何在</p>
<p>家庭制度旣爲社會生活的重心所寄，則欲求家制的健全，家庭非自有其適當的重心不了。這又是本書所特別關注到的一點，並且是始終很一貫的。上文所已論到的法定監護人的地位應在遺囑監護人之先的一點，也未始不是這方面的一個例子。一家的重心在父母，父母亡故，重心失墜，因此不能不有法定監護人把這重心再度建立起來，遺囑監護人旣是外人，名爲監護，實則與重心的恢復全不相干，所以他的地位應當在法定監護人之後了。作者對於禁治產人的監護，也取同樣的態度；同一是法定監護人，民法使配偶位居父母之先，作者則以爲『依中國大多數家庭情况論，同居之父母應列首位，配偶次之，不同居之父母又次之；且就外國法例論之，亦不盡使配偶居絕對之首位』</p>
<p>民法規定「夫妻於日常家務互爲代理人」，作者對於這一層頗致非難，而推其所以非難的原因，最重要的也無非是想根據了古所稱『物莫能兩大」的原則，來維持家制的重心。這是很對的。妻可爲夫的代理人，夫亦可爲妻的代理人，但要看塲合，看需要，看一方是不是發生故障，而非由人代理不可，但若說平時，隨時，在日常生活裏，夫妻互爲代理人，那確乎是不妥的。作者舉着例說，夫或妻一日出外購物三十元，根據了代理的原則，勢必彼此各負責十五元，「夫妻間如此錙銖必較，有甚於合夥之股東，配偶間情誼何存？故堅持此說，則此項法律之瑣屑，極梏人性，開古今中外未有之惡例』（頁九六）。夫婦分財之制，最近一二十年來，即在主張男女平權與女子經濟獨立最有力的人，例如英國的靈理士，也已經開始懷疑，認爲於情於理均有未妥。今立法者在原則上旣主男女「絕對」平等，則經濟事實上便非分財不可，而法律上便非有互爲代理的規定不可，經濟生活如此，它方面的生活也勢不能不如此—見解的不健全終必引起理論上的治絲尤紊，不可究詰，事實的窒礙難行，猶是後來之事，這也是很好的一例了。</p>
<p>絕對平等的理論旣在民法上產生了所謂夫婦互爲代理人的規定，而絕對民權的理論又造作了家長推定的條文—眞是無獨有偶。作者對家制應有其重心的原則，旣苦心維持，對此亦自不能　默。他說，「推定辦法，大悖中國家族之精神……。殊不知家庭之組織，基於恩義關係，不似國家之組織係以强權相脅。恩義盡絕者，可以分離；成年不滿意家長者，亦可請求分離。法律上旣無强迫其合成一家之規定，何須藉推定方法以緩和各方之情感？若家長實屬頑劣，其家屬將遠避之不暇，更不願用推定方法，另易家長而與之共處。故推定家長之原則，使社會上原有之家長（依習慣爲尊輩者）感覺不安，以動搖家庭之基礎，轉違法律維持家制之本意……」（頁四二〇）此段議論甚好。民權誰屬重要，選舉推定之法雖屬甚好，但稍有常識的人也知道無論如何用不到家庭的場合之上。家族建築在恩義上，不建築在權勢上；建築在權勢上的國家，二十多年來，大夢未醒，至今對於官史的進退，民意的從違，尙且不能採用眞正的選舉或投票方式，乃欲建築在恩義上的家族實行選舉之制，此話眞不知從何說起！</p>
<p>現民法對於家長，特重義務，而不規定權力，連最低限度的維持家室和平秩序之權都沒有提到。又對於家族財產，一面制定夫妻財產制與容許未成年人的特有財產，而一面於固有的家族共財制反隻字不提。作者對於這兩層都認爲是一些缺陷（頁四八—四九），對於家族或家庭應有的重心都很有妨礙。家長的產生旣首重推定，產生之後，又不許公有任何權力，對於家族財產的分配管理，又作不得分毫主張，道探的一個家，如果住在一起，可以說連一個客棧或公寓都不如，要它做甚？應有重心的『家』，照現行民法做去，行見重心日趨消失，至於不能維持而後已，而不應同樣的講求重心的「國」，一二十年來，却不斷的在建立一種重心，不斷的在實行一種强「本一弱『末』的政策，根本忘記民主國家的本根與重心在民，而不在政府，在地方，而不在中央；我們如今把民法上的家與實際上的國兩相對照，眞不能不有幾分啼笑皆非之感。</p>
<p>三·民法學家的窘態</p>
<p>家制的問題鬧了很久了，社會學家與關心社會問題的人不斷的討論過，民法學家，特別在制定民法的幾年裏，也討論得很熱鬧。不過民法學家以外的人討論起來比較容易，比較可以不負責任，傾向於　人主義的人可以澈頭澈尾的主張小家庭，夫婦間絕對自由平等，經濟生活如此，其它生活方面亦莫不如此，至於家庭中種種關係的細節目，儘可以擱過不問；說現成理論容易，解決實際問題困難，這班朋友走的顯然是一條避重就輕的路。至於傾向於社會主義的議論家說話似乎更要容易；老人進養老院，兒童進公育院，離婚絕對自由，家制不是根本沒有多大存在的理由麼？記得當年有人寫了一本家庭問題的專書，結論是要把家庭取消，家庭旣一筆勾銷，還成甚麽問題麽？其爲乾脆，得未曾有。（近年以來，這一班朋友鑒於蘇俄家庭的依然存在，離婚的自由大受限制，托兒辦法的祗限日間；同時自己也成了家，當了父親，嘗過了一些眞正的甘苦，已不再作此種乾脆的議論）</p>
<p>不過民法學家的地位與此大不相同，他們說話不便一相情願，不能信口開河，他們要規定條文，要用黑筆在白紙上句斟字酌的寫下來，要制成一種敎人信守而多少可以垂諸久遠的定法；他們一面旣須顧到事實與經騐，否則有法等於無法，不是窒碍難行，便是形同虛設，一面却又不能不攙和些理論與理想，否則豈不否認了法律的領導的機能，而自貽保守，落伍，以至於反動的譏誚？於是我們負立法責任的法學家就苦了。而更不幸的是中國關於家制的事實與經驗，好比江心的一塊大石，是最頑强不過的，時下涉及家制的理論與理想，好比江中的一股急流，又是最湍激不過的，而夾在中間的不是別人，就是我們的民法學家。當年立法時，他們那種左右爲難，進退失據的光景，評介者曾經不客氣的加以分析過。</p>
<p>其實這種窘態是可以避免的。立法者在立法之前爲甚麼不和比較謹嚴而脚踏實地的社會學者與人類學者商量一番？第一步，對於已往家制的利弊先有一個比較精確的分析。第二步，對於西洋的家制，也應當下一番同樣的工夫。第三步，根據了興利除弊的原則，提出一個修正的方案來；這方案的基本原則應該是化固有的畸形發展爲正常發展，而所謂正常，指的是家庭生活要成爲個人生命與社會生命的一大助力，而不再是一大阻力。對於這樣一個修正家制的方案，衆謀僉同之後，才走第四步，那就是親族法的制定了。</p>

<p>在現實生活中，有時必要地需要有一點有益而又有趣的讀物，這無論是職業靑年或就學靑年，都有這麽一點感覺吧？好，那麽現在我來介紹給諸位一本書——性敎育新論。</p>
<p>這書是德國布式克，雅各生兩醫博士原作，經伊登，保羅兩夫婦譯成英文，董秋斯由英文再轉譯成中文的。原作者是著名的德國醫學博上，而英譯者曾從事工作於「資本論」新譯本，足見這書是很有價値的了。</p>
<p>當然，目前市上有不少性學譯作或著作，但一翻之後，就可知道是一些濫調，不是以色情的誘惑圖利的作品，便是其出汲點很不正確，含有幻想與誇張性，讀後不免有各種流弊，縱慾以至戕生；所以現在特別提出這本「性敎育新論」，來與諸君討論下。</p>
<p>這書是含有教育氣味的，前幾章中把男女的生殖器官解剖說明，中間又說明了春情發動時期與性衝動，最後它叙出花柳病的流源，個人預防法，與優生衛生學，結尾是結婚指導。</p>
<p>把這書讀完之後，你就覺得能得到一些知識的，因爲它把性學的各部門都有簡明的叙述，而附有插圖；它吿訴我們許多利害問題，並贊成一夫一妻制，它說：</p>
<p>「我們以爲，唯一正當的途經是一貫地趨向純正的一夫一妻制，……一種純正的結婚是一個利己的男性與一個利己的女性建立在相互吸力上的共同關係，男女雙方的利己心的密切結合之後，雙方皆不把利己心看作特有的，因爲雙方把它看作一種共同的利己心了……額外求歡的，不是破壞結婚，而是破壞愛情的結子……」</p>
<p>的　的，一夫一妻是良好的辦法，非但有益個人且有益於社會，國家，它的指示是應該實行的。</p>
<p>總之，它是一本有益的讀物，作者所說：</p>
<p>「歷史敎訓我們，在大的戰爭和經濟動亂以後，在那過渡時期，墮落的現象格外容易表現在性生活的領域。」</p>
<p>現在，正是這過渡時間，希望諸君耐心的讀一遍吧！</p>

<p>— 湯菊宇</p>
<p>羅洪著，短篇小說集正言出版社刋</p>
<p>這時代包括八個短篇小說，寫作的年份，最早是二十七年，最近是三十三年，相隔有五六年。但這五六年皆在抗戰期間，故此八個短篇均以抗戰做背景。抗戰使整個社會發生不平凡的變動，本來豐衣足食的，現在破產了；本來過着憩靜的生活的，現在流浪了；反之，本來一貧如洗的，借着機會已爬上來；本來作市井無賴的，早發展成爲敵人的走狗帮凶。四事滄桑，莫此爲甚，而人心的向上或墮落，也沒有比這一時間變化得更快，表現得更淸楚，更深刻的了。小說所要寫要刻劃的是人，即使所謂抗戰小說，除却意味着描寫抗戰期中的人外，我委實想不出別的寫法。旣然在抗戰中無一人能超脫抗戰，則寫各種人亦即反映抗戰中的各角浴，這時代的背景是抗戰，寫的是人，但都不是了不得的人，而是在社會上最常碰到的普通人，因而也就是反映抗戰中最現實的社會。</p>
<p>這時代非常寫實，沒有曲折的故事，也沒有離奇的情節，作者旣然着重刻劃人，便只須在最不出人意外的平凡事情上讓其人物表露心跡，讓其人物動作，唯其愈不出人意外，使我們感覺到愈親切，愈接近。眞的，這社會有不少像王八，李四爺（王伯炎與李四爺）李三爺（隣居們），徐兆璋（友誼）等這一類人物，也許表面上他們不是，心底里都是的。</p>
<p>作者自己說，她「常常喜歡寫」王八「李四爺」以及「隣居們」中那位老主人公這類人物」（後記）。這類人物都是社會上多餘人物，從一方面看他們是可憐的，從另一方面介他們是可笑的，例如：王八是破落戶，「孤獨無援，連駡人也要吃虧」，他駡人「王八」，結果一張嘴敵不過衆人的嘴，他自己反被敕爲「王八」，這麼大一個世界，叫他的名字的就只有一個李四爺。隣居們里的李三爺也是一個類似的人物，他的家產給戰爭打完了，祗好拿房子出租給無賴流氓一類人物，想起自己的破落，便深恨隣居的無恥發財，更反對他們的借捐款飽私囊，可是爲了爭面子，他却又會情願被敲竹槓，違心拿出捐款來，這種糊塗動作是極人情味的。</p>
<p>作者在另外一篇小說雪夜中，寫出另一種典型的老年人，一個醉心於古的書獃子，但戰爭鬧窮了他，使他不得不面對現實人生，使他產生劇烈的愛與恨，於是他帮助當遊擊隊的姪子搶救抗戰被難同志，大義滅親地反對做漢奸的弟弟，發揮眞正儒家的精神。雪地這小說雖然作者自謂着重在寫靑年，但她寫得特出的，例是這位會愛會恨的老人家。</p>
<p>在另一方面，作者寫都市裏的知識份子。在這時代中她寫曾經在五四運動非常前進，而現在保守得想把女兒一生抱在自己　邊的母親；在魔中，她寫天天拿玩來麻醉自己的闊太太，可是實際上她却有「一種沒來由的煩惱，一種常常襲上心來的沒根兒的空虛，無端地會爬上心頭的」（第一六〇頁），無窮的空虛，沒有愛，沒有生活的樂趣。</p>
<p>旣然作者採取平凡的故事來刻劃人的心理，那麼這心理就要刻劃得深刻，這是必須的。</p>
<p>這時代很能抓住一些現實的題材來刻劃人，但從深刻講，却是不够的。王八李四爺李三爺之間，沒有明顯不同的個性。雪夜的靑年是抽象的。友誼要說出人發財了以後的勢利，可是所寫的人太平面化了，結果也只令人看了一個故事而已。倒是這時代裏的母親，魔里感覺空虛的太太，令人同情了解。</p>
<p>什麼　做　刻呢？我想無非就是人情味，沒有單純的壞人，也沒有單純的好人，我們應該由矛盾上去提取一個人的心理，仔細解剖他，仔細歸納他，同時用一個最適合的故事中把這些心理恰當地表現出來。故事是平常的，意識是深刻的。平凡而深刻，正需天才的努力。這時代對我啓示了這一點。</p>

<h3 id="c154">某夜紀事 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 何甫</p>
<p>是初夏季節，因為利用日光節約，下午九句鐘，天才昏黑；夜色開始遮蓋這條灰暗污穢的小弄。這時，左隣右居大大小小的電燈，先先後後開始發出强弱不一的光芒。我們那五支光電泡，也不約而同地旋亮了。我和妻，孩子，晚飯後沒有事，於是讓整天辛勞的身體，交給破牀。</p>
<p>在這牀上，把這一整天的事；小如合家生計，瑣屑家常。大至國社會，都可以說是談話的好資料。我們窮人，說起來總是吃飯第一，米價的漲落與我們的生存是息息相關的。不久以前，米價　然跳上七關，寒舍里離由一粥一飯減為薄粥二　，仍是惶惶然終日難安。幸而近數日逐步降下，眞是叨天大幸，緊張的人心，稍見平靖。妻說：</p>
<p>「今天米價又跌落些，陸續回降，總是好事。」</p>
<p>「當然啰！我們的希望是：回降以後，不再暴漲才是。因為經騐告訴人們：過去的米價是經過了數度暴漲與小回才到現在的市價的。」我的回答。</p>
<p>「但願這次回降以後，當局能更進一步消弭此種不合理的漲風，眞是好生之德的事。」</p>
<p>「是啊！目下當局正雷厲風行，决心消滅囤積，抑平米價。我認為祗要有决心，肯眞正對於人民大衆的生死問題感到切膚之痛！一切總是有辦法解决的。」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>隔壁是皮鞋作，工塲里正忙得熱鬧！打楦頭聲，縫紉機聲，談笑聲，雜然並作。老司務嘴里哼着各種小調，京腔。他們是從：「正月…里來…是新春…」唱到：「三生……有……幸」音調雖似粗魯些，看他們倒也自由自在，興趣盎然。</p>
<p>我們的話鋒轉向這邊，妻說：</p>
<p>「這個勢口，還是像他們那些手藝人做人比較一般人有樂趣。」</p>
<p>「不過在他們，自然也有他們做人的苦處，你我是局外人，究竟隔膜些！」我異議地說。</p>
<p>「祗要有錢到手，即使再苦些，倒也無所謂。只有千苦萬苦還是苦不飽肚子的人，才是最苦的人！」她肯定地向我申述。</p>
<p>「然而我覺得他們一淸早起身，做到深更半夜，所得也相當微薄吧！」我於是輕輕地問她。</p>
<p>她笑笑，接着搖搖頭說：</p>
<p>「你的估計是錯了！事實是絕對的相反，人家每天只是向香烟，喝酒，吃雜食，化上那麼四五千，還嫌不够！不要說是養家活口，讓大大小小吃得舒舒服服。你得想：像他們之中，那個阿根；鄕下有妻子兒女，上海還有姘頭，二面開伙倉。自己還歡喜吃些，穿些，享受些！他自己手下帶二個學徒，學三年生意，一年內學成，二年多　師父做，吃口苦飯，拏些少數的月規錢，除此以外，做下的生活，工資，都是師父的。做不好，或者偷懶，還得挨皮鞭！阿根司務一個人，有六隻手幫他賺錢。他一天賺四五萬，是常事。」他略等後繼續說：「就是普通不收學徒，靠自己動　工作的老司務，每天賺他二萬元，也並不希罕！」</p>
<p>我帶着驚奇的目光，不斷搖首表示不相信！然而她有事實向交傞說：</p>
<p>「阿根司務每塲麻將的上落總要近念萬，此是一。阿根嫂，和他姘婦的粗臂上的金鐲子，手指上的金戒子，是眼看他們陸續打來的，此其二。阿根鄕間新近賈良田拾餘畝，這是他親口對人家說的，此其三。就憑這三點，你就可以知道阿根每日的時益如何！」</p>
<p>這些，我平時在隣居嘴里，也會聽到。阿根司務年來因物價的高漲，工資的不斷遞增，他一天到晚，滿面春風，眞所謂心廣體胖，的確，他近來更顯得比以前格外胖些，身上的衣着亦比以前更好了！是的，我是應該承認的！</p>
<p>我默然，我開始慚愧，慚愧自己太沒用！我開始懊悔，懊悔自己為什麼要讀那麼些勞什子的書？先祖父的遺訓在我腦海里浮起：</p>
<p>「孩子們！你們年紀還小，多讀書不一定能換飯吃。小孩子應該當學徒，學一種手藝，荒年餓不死手藝人！不認字好吃飯，沒有手藝，不好做人！……」</p>
<p>事實擺在眼前，老年人的話是不錯的。</p>
<p>不然的話：我如果幼時馴從先祖父的話做；不論跟了木匠，銅匠，泥水匠皮鞋匠！即使再苦些，不過那麼三年的學徒生活，總不致於會受累到今天？然而，這個社會里，吃飽無福，餓死有份的人，又何止千萬！像我，祗不過是千萬份中之一而已。</p>
<p>孩子偎在娘懷裏，呼呼睡去</p>
<p>「雯兒已是二足歲了！那麼活潑，那麼天眞！她不知道天高地厚；世故人情，爺娘酸苦。見人家吃肉，小嘴裏常是哼着：「肉肉」，「肉肉」！實在天曉得；做爺娘的眞是對不起她！天天哄着孩子：「明天買」，「姆媽明天買」！她「哦」，「哦」地應着，怪是可憐！至於說，幾時能化幾千元買斤肉大家吃吃，我眞是毫無把握，不敢往下想。」妻似乎帶着無限辛酸楚楚地說。</p>
<p>我躊躇了一回，緩緩地道：「總希望命運，我們的命運，有一天會否極泰來，苦盡甘至，一切不能解決的問題，自然能够得解決了」……可是實在，我時常想到我們的命運，這個悲慘到使人窒息底命運，整整地已是九個年頭。這些悠長的歲月裏，那一天有安定的好日子過？說是國家的最後勝利早已來臨，我們小百姓，絕不想生活上任何奢侈的享受。但求國家眞正的太平；一切的事，從從容容走上復員的軌道。粗菜白飯，安居樂業，能過一輩子，也够滿足了。可是，可是人世間的事；終是難從人願的！張開眼睛；是這麼一個渾渾噩噩的亂世！眞是太恐怖，太恐怖了！……以後怎樣？誰敢想像？……我的腦中有許多話要講，然而說不出口，我還是默然無語。</p>
<p>夜已深，推開窗，天空一片漆黑，人聲漸漸靜寂下來。晚風吹來，還帶着暮春的凉意，心緒不寗，難以安眠。……</p>
<p>突然，隔壁傳來一連串喧嚷聲，我於是側耳靜聽：</p>
<p>「姆媽，姆媽呀！」是女的，招弟的聲音。</p>
<p>「阿姨，阿姨啊！」前樓毛英在狂喊！</p>
<p>「嫂嫂，嫂嫂！你怎麼了啊！」悽厲的哭音。</p>
<p>「啊喲，姆媽，姆媽，姆……媽……」</p>
<p>「阿姨啊！你……你……你醒醒呀！醒醒啊！」</p>
<p>緊接着一片騷擾聲以後，是一片慘痛的哭聲：</p>
<p>「招弟娘啊！你怎捨……得……拋下了兒…女獨自去了……呀！」不斷抽噎着。</p>
<p>「姆媽啊！……你……幾時能……够活轉來……呀？」音調是那麼傷心。</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>有人吩咐：「人也沒有辦法了！大家也不必哭了！我們還是趕緊預備後事吧。」</p>
<p>接着，紛雜的皮鞋足聲，搬桌子聲，移牀聲，亂了一陣子。</p>
<p>我的神經緊張，頭發昏，我的手足冰冷。開始　顫抖起來。我像是剛從噩夢中醒來，「唉！可憐！招弟娘—那個和靄可親，害了半年多肺病的中年女人，她死了，是給貧與病的魔鬼活活地抓去的。」我含着悲痛，忍着眼淚，自言自語。</p>
<p>妻累極了！已悠悠睡着。並沒有給紛擾的哭聲驚醒，讓她安睡吧！明天還有事情的。前樓嫂嫂緊睜着哭得紅腫的眼睛，推進房門來，坐在我的牀沿口。我勸她不要多傷心！人死了，不會復活，再傷心也沒有用！這裏坐坐，休息休息吧！</p>
<p>我又向她問長問短，她是招弟的姊妹淘，她很熱心，招弟弟娘的事，瞞不了她。承她之情，叨叨地告訴我關於招弟娘的一部份事。以下是她的談話：</p>
<p>「阿雯爺！不瞞你說：招弟娘是可憐啊！寃枉死的。……</p>
<p>「去年六六月：時局還沒有和平，那時上海轟炸得厲害，一個炸彈落在虹口，她那時在紗廠里做工，額角頭高，沒有把炸死，她從灰堆里爬出來，性命算是拾得了！後來……自從八月里那天，上海城爆竹震天，中國勝利了，世界和平了！招弟娘歡喜得落下了許多眼淚，再後來，想不到一個月內，她的工廠停了工，招弟娘回到了家里坐吃。同一個時期里，她的男人亦被公司里解散出來！夫婦倆都打碎了飯碗。她憂憂急急，把素來單薄的身體，這樣種上了病根。招弟爺做小生意，時運又不亨通，蝕了血本不算，觸霉頭末了還給警察抓到「行」里，他氣氣悶悶出「行」後，傷透了心，丟了妻子兒女，不知道出走到那里去了！到現在六個多月沒有信息。招弟看見爺娘苦，無法想，到人家店裏收衣裳汰，可憐汰來的錢也不够吃，那裏來錢醫娘的病，她娘也不願意把女兒的汗血錢化在自己身上。她想挨挨會得得好的，想不到今天……唉！可憐，作孽呀！吸！吸！」她說到這里，又禁不住嗚嗚哭起來！</p>
<p>「不要哭吧！自己身體也是要緊的，那麼，現在怎樣呢？招弟娘的喪事如何料理？」我長長地喘了一口氣，安慰着問她。</p>
<p>前樓嫂嫂用手絹擦着眼淚，又擦擦鼻泥抑住了痛楚的哭泣：</p>
<p>「還有什麼親人來替她料理，我自己又是窮鬼，天天年三十。日愁夜愁！愁不得天亮。明天只有叫招弟到她自己份上的親眷那里求借些錢。我們大家靠天吃飯，行些方便，多多少少凑些。讓招弟娘　口薄皮棺材算了！」</p>
<p>我點點頭，沒有更善的話，回答前樓嫂嫂。眼睛前一陣閃鑠，一陣撩亂，禁不住悲從中來。</p>
<p>「怎麼！阿雯爺，你也哭起來了！」</p>
<p>「不，我沒有哭！我不會哭的。」我强制抑住了情感苦笑着</p>
<p>時鐘鏜……鏜……她高鳴！是十二點鐘。前樓嫂嫂向我告別，她要到隔壁陪爺去。我目送她出了房門。</p>
<p>「人死了，一切就完了！實在，像我們這些比草芥還不如的人命，活在此時此地；活着似乎亦嫌多餘！……本來末，人活在世界上，生生死死是最平凡不過的事。尤其我們庸庸碌碌，赤貧如洗的窮措大們，活着活受罪，活作孽！還是死了淸靜，死了乾脆？……口眼一閉，一了百了！……」我昏昏沉沉跌入沉思的漩渦。</p>
<p>「招弟娘永遠安息了！千百個「招弟娘」正步着招弟娘的後路。……」</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>我疲倦極了！我合上眼，亟想安靜些睡去。但是，吸血蟲（臭虫）似乎立刻已下了突擊的「命令」！那些令人憎惡的小動物，它們從剝蝕得　敗不堪的牆角裏；磚縫裏，舖板裏，陸陸續續「出動」。起初我的手臂上首先被「攻擊」！不及身體各部份普遍地遭到痛噬。我忍不住，起身搜捕。孩子的小手拚命在小腿上「沙」！「沙」地搔，創痕上痞塊班班不可數計，怪是可憐！可恨這些小動物吮飽了人的血液，溜的溜，跑的跑！貪得無厭吃得太飽因而逃不出「虎口」的，也就束手被擒；立予斃命！死後，一股惡臭味，直冲鼻腔，一經吸血虫吮進口，立時即變臭血，惡臭之味使人作嘔。我們對於吸血虫，眞是談「虫」色變，捉不完，殺不盡，來了去，去了來！川流不息。窮人是最不幸的，無好吃好穿，正是患着「貧血」症，但吸血虫徧徧專向「貧血」患者「襲擊」。想遷屋別處，可是手里沒有金條。想買DDT，價目又是那麼昂貴！拏「貧血」來豢養吸血虫，像是窮人上天注定了的名份。無法避免的。</p>
<p>門外有開門聲音，「是啥人？」我聽得二房東太太高聲問。</p>
<p>「是我！」回答是一個淸脆的女音。</p>
<p>「美珍是哦？」</p>
<p>「是的！」</p>
<p>「你回家了！」接着說：「今朝好　？」</p>
<p>「好是還算好！兩個爛水手那裏，就賺了六塊瓜爾Gold！」</p>
<p>「蠻好，蠻好！早些睡吧！辰光勿早哉！」繼續是，「明朝會！」</p>
<p>「明朝會！」我聽得美珍告別二房東太太後，摸索着一步一步上樓梯；皮鞋在樓梯級板上磨擦，四周板壁和百葉窗被震得格格地響。</p>
<p>房門聲過後，美珍的母親就和女兒談起來。</p>
<p>「珍珍！你今朝回家遲了，吃力了！」母親殷勤體貼的口吻，「不要坐着胡思亂想吧！就裏牀安逸些睡覺吧！」</p>
<p>「姆媽，我……我苦……苦憐……」美珍似乎忽然帶着辛酸顫抖的哭音。</p>
<p>「為啥？啥事體心裏難過？珍兒！你……你不要哭，告訴我娘，告訴我今朝出了啥事情？！」娘斷續地問着女兒。</p>
<p>「告訴！告訴你……你又有什麼用？什麼用！」女兒嗚咽着</p>
<p>「那麼，那麼你不能不告訴我娘呀！珍兒！好好地不要哭吧！告訴姆媽，告訴姆媽！」母親在追問。</p>
<p>我屏氣凝神，細聽美珍哀婉地在娘身邊訴苦境：</p>
<p>「姆媽啊！今天女兒晦氣上身，兩個殺胚，色鬼！不要面孔的爛水手，在公司裏吃醉了酒，硬手硬脚發神經病一樣的虐弄我」話音漸低，「上身摸到下身，下身摸……到……我……我為了幾塊「瓜爾」，我又不敢向他們光火，要想强，總是强他們不過。我沒法，我只好百樣忍住，眼……淚往……肚裏嚥！後來，我仍殷勤地侍候他們，不想……不想事後他們將我挾上了三輪車，說是開……房……間去！我害怕，我不願意！他們說十元瓜爾可以打倒我，我急得要命，等到一拏到六元瓜爾「招待」費以後，想從後門溜走。可是我們那大班……嗚……嗚……嗚！」她又泣起來。</p>
<p>「大班怎麼說？」母親又在問。</p>
<p>「大班……他說我不會應付客人！他說：每個吧女都是這樣，他公司準早關門大吉！你又不是美貌西施，月裏嫦娥，碰不得的。你要做千金，到自己家裏去！這裏用不着你……我氣得發昏，哭了個死去活來。金妹姊看得不好意思送我出了××酒吧間的後門……嗚……嗚……」她哭着繼續說下去：「路上，碰着三個不二不三的洋裝癟三，在我背後吱吱喳喳講些不要臉的下流話，他們跟在我後面，越走越釘近我，我慌了！回轉頭去說了他們幾句。他們破口就駡我：宿貨！××里的宿貨！賣×貨，你鏡了裏去照照看！專門吃外國×的東西！誰要釘你梢，眼烏珠肏瞎了的！……我，我看他們走了就跌跌衝衝一口氣走到家裏……」她咿咿唔唔哭得格外傷心。</p>
<p>「珍兒，你且停住哭吧！人家要睡覺的，你不要把隔壁鄰居吵醒了！難為情的。」接着是「唉！唉！都苦在你爺手裏，我們前世不修後世苦！有啥話頭。」她娘唏噓地興起了無限的慨嘆！</p>
<p>她母女倆輕微地談了些私話，說些什麼？我聽不淸楚！不多時，他房裏滅了燈，就靜寂了！</p>
<p>美珍的家，我是知道得很淸楚的。她家與我家，僅僅隔着一層又髒又黑蛛絲塵埃滿佈的牆壁。她父親戰前亦是一個自奉淸高磊落的硬漢。戰爭那年死去了！拋下了妻女幾個不幸人，她大哥後來激於愛國赤忱，遠走內地。到現在仍是消息沉沉，許是為國家丟了性命，許是仍流浪在好運天之涯，海之角，有家歸不來！她合家數年來典質俱窮！多多少少裝人家肚子裏。她娘為了生活，無法可想；忍痛讓她大姊在舞塲裏靠姿色換取合家的麵包。不幸她大姊後來亦死了！算日子，已近二年。她大姊是十足地給梅毒病菌害死的。大姊死後；她娘曾對天發過誓，立過願！她再不願見二女兒再蹈火女兒覆轍。她是希望二女兒慢慢地找個對象，好好得到一個終身的歸宿。</p>
<p>然而現在啊，現在的她：已是大門口高懸着中美兩强的國旗，五光十色的霓虹燈光，照燈下底女招待——酒吧女郎！</p>
<p>是在勝利以後……</p>
<p>是在全市慶祝勝利後第一次國慶紀念日以後……</p>
<p>她的年紀，僅是十九歲！……</p>
<p>夜是更深了！我還是不能安穩地睡着。我怕，我實在害怕再讓這些事情苦苦纏住下去。但我　合上眼。心緒還不曾寗靜，　地吱吱喳喳一陣尖銳的鼠吷聲攢入耳朶。又張開疲乏的眼睛；惡鼠三五成羣在棟樑上穿梭般追逐跳躍，油垢重重的牆上，給打了洞，老鼠們從洞里進出自如。前樓到後樓；後樓到亭子間，咬壞用具，啃蝕食物。白天里，牠們隱藏得毫無踪跡，每至夜深人靜，便不約而同地猖獗起來！我捉牠，牠的行動比我迅速，感覺比我靈敏。牠還有銳利的牙齒，足以使我心寒，不敢下手！我追得凶，牠一時避起來，電燈一滅，牠又活躍了！</p>
<p>我為了這些惡鼠的到處橫行，我曾與合屋鄰居商議對策，決讓是：</p>
<p>「八戶合養貓一頭，專捕夜鼠！」</p>
<p>但結果貓竟懾於鼠威，我們的辦法宣告失敗了！因此，無法可想，於是祗好在烏烟瘴氣，惡鼠跋扈下，忍受着百般痛楚，因循茍且下去。</p>
<p>隱約聞得江海關的巨鐘嗚了，是四句鐘。門口「跌跌」「塔塔」一陣陣脚步聲。</p>
<p>「大餅油條，要　！大餅油條！……」</p>
<p>「快些走罷！辰光已晚，市場上要嘸啥好「行」了……！」</p>
<p>「天要亮了！攤還不曾擺出，怎麼來得及……」</p>
<p>小販們開始趕着「早市」。</p>
<p>看窗外；天邊已露出曙光，雖是天將亮，但猶未亮！</p>
<p>這一個整夜，就是這樣的挨過的，如果說：這是不平凡的一夜，但或許倒是十分平凡的。說它是平凡的話，那或許倒並不平凡。</p>
<p>失眠是苦事，然而又記了這麼些苦事，心裏是格外地痛苦，難受！……</p>

<h3 id="c155">西北小頌（三則） <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 張徹</p>
<p>（一）白楊</p>
<p>在北方的遲遲而來的春天中，白楊是最早透露出春的消息的。在北方色彩單調的黃土原中，白楊是惟一挺拔於黃灰色的凡庸之上的。</p>
<p>牠直，水不俯伏乞憐向風雨；牠高，氷遠高於沉悶的所有景物。牠有用，是西北最為大衆所普遍使用的木材；牠是綠色，當黃河仍封鎖於冰雪之下的時候，已在樹梢上掙扎透出了新的嫩芽。</p>
<p>閒步在黃土的原野上，遠遠的白楊底行列，像一片棕綠的朝煙，這是大地上最有生氣的顏色呵！我讚美白楊，因為牠挺立不拔的氣槪，因為牠首先傳來春底足音。</p>
<p>（二）麻雀</p>
<p>在淸晨起床時，不知要用什麼衣服來應付西北善變的氣候；但當聽見麻雀歡快而充滿陽氣的鳴聲時，就知道今天可以有好的天氣了。</p>
<p>麻雀是使者，太陽　快樂的使者，聽了牠的鳴聲，在床上披起衣服時；就使人想像到高而　的大；　髪樣輕　的白雲，濕煦的微風，明亮的陽光，而當迎着牠底呼喚，走出戶外時，就可以嗅到春天的香味，接受到太陽的金箭。</p>
<p>我喜愛麻雀，像對一切美好的事物的預言者。</p>
<p>（三）鴿與風箏</p>
<p>厭倦於生活的道路的人們，不願抬頭看天，奔忙於生活的道路的人們，無暇抬頭看天；但春天畢竟是春天，我們有鴿子與風箏。</p>

<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>銀鑲玉琢般的荒郊，靜得人獸絕迹，連飛鳥都沒有一隻，雪掩蓋了一切，地面上看不見一根枝桿，一片落葉，小紅走過去的脚印，立刻便塡平了。小紅摸索到了每天照例檢柴的小小樹林裏用扁槓抖搜着在地上挑開積雪，尋覓目標物。可是慘得很！撿了半天，還沒有檢够一捆的量。小紅急了，她怎樣回去交差呢？這點濕柴，連上水份，也不到十斤重，而老闆娘每天限她至少要檢足三十斤，現在還差得遠哩！而且看着看着天就要黑了，小紅的手脚已凍得不靈活了，身上一陣陣冷得打顫！不得已只好背起那捆濕柴走向歸途。這時風聲更緊，雪花更密。路上行人稀少，小紅寸步難行地跟跆着。頭上的黑布變成了一頂白盔，身上襟反穿件珍珠毛的羊皮襖。想着自己這般難堪的苦命，小紅傷心！眼淚和鼻涕混着呼吸的空氣，結了冰！</p>
<p>「老天爺！睜睜眼吧，快點睛暖起來，這樣下去，我活不成了！」</p>
<p>小紅唏噓地祈禱着！她再没有今天这般觉得绝望了！她想到回自己的家一样吃不饱，她想到廖棟还小，还要好幾年才能成人；而且她想到廖棟的不理她，也許是由於不喜歡她；那麼即使盼到他長大了，成了親；也還是不快活的；因此，她開始感到活得不耐煩了！她怪　爹媽養不了她，為什麼不早把她治死？旣要把她交給　人養，為什麼不找個好人家？她只要一聽見老闆娘說話的聲音，她就嚇得哆嗦；看見老闆娘的樣子，她就嚇得像看見了閻王，混身起着雞皮疙瘩。當她快到了回春堂，她眺望了一下對門自己的家，她恨不跑回去向爹媽哭訴一番，但是她怕他們難過，她不能再讓爹媽為着她的痛苦，痛苦！於是她一咬牙，便仍舊走時了回春堂。</p>
<p>寳鈴正在櫃臺閒着沒事，冷得直搓手，瞥見小紅回來，連忙跑過去替她卸下背上的濕柴，替她拿到後面廚房去。這使小紅非常感激！她常常想：假如廖棟是這樣體恤她，帮助她！她就是再苦些，也樂意！可是不，廖棟對她一點思情沒有，如今沒有，將來也不會有！但為什麼呢？為什麼他會這樣？她有什麼地方得罪了他嗎？　　他還以為她在這個家裏作的不够病嗎？她不明白，她一定要找個機會問問他，她不能死了還是個糊塗鬼！她這樣拿定了主意。</p>
<p>「天已經不早了，我來帮你燒晚飯。」寳鈴說着，一面替小紅把灶裏升起火來，一面把鍋裏盛了水。</p>
<p>『謝謝你，寳鈴哥，請把鍋裏多盛些水，燒熟了我要一盆洗洗脚，然後你再下米煮飯。』小紅說。</p>
<p>「小紅希望一盆熱水煖煖脚，她凍得實在受不了啦！她解下包頭的黑布，坐在灶前烤着火。冰見了熱氣便化成了水，她的衣服全濕透了。」</p>
<p>『今天的柴撿少了，等會見兒又免不了要挨駡。』小紅胆怯地說。</p>
<p>『這樣大雪天本來就不該去的，她說少，呌她自己去撿撿試試。』寳鈴憤憤地說。『一個人不能太不講理了。』</p>

<h3 id="e1">The CCP Fails to Fulfill Troop Reorganization Plan, Prospects for Negotiations Dim Again, Representatives of the Three Parties Are Engaging in Compromise <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Thirteen days have passed since the announcement of the ceasefire, and the ceasefire deadline is noon on the 22nd. Counting the night of the 19th, there are only sixty hours left. On the 19th, this reporter inquired everywhere all day and learned that the peace negotiations have been stalled because the CCP is unwilling to faithfully fulfill the troop reorganization plan, opposes the arbitrator authority of Ambassador Marshall, and demands police power over railway protection in the plan to restore transportation. According to sources close to the CCP, Zhou Enlai is now awaiting a reply from Yan'an. If he receives instructions tonight or at night, he intends to visit Ambassador Marshall to discuss matters at any time.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] It is reported that the government's proposed reorganization and unified編制 plan has clear and reasonable regulations on the areas where the Communist troops are stationed inside and outside the Guan. In the Northeast, the Communist troops are allowed to station three divisions in Qiqihar, Hailanpao, and Yongji. However, in North China, two divisions must be reduced, and the Communist troops must withdraw from Harbin, Rehe, Chahar, and Yantai and Weihaiwei in Shandong. They must also withdraw from Dezhou, Tai'an, Lincheng on the Jinpu Line, and Zaozhuang, Zhangdian, Zhoucun, and Jiaoxian on the Linzao branch line. The CCP's demands for stationed areas include Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan in the Northeast, as well as most of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces. If this news is accurate, it will be difficult for both parties to reach an agreement due to the great distance between them. According to CCP sources, the CCP is facing a life-or-death crisis.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 19th] The optimism regarding the future of consultations here in the past 24 hours has turned dim again because the Communist Party failed to accept President Chiang's new righteousness regarding troop reorganization and the areas where the Communist troops are stationed in North China and the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] This morning, representatives of the Democratic League, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, and Zhang Bojun, visited Zhou Enlai. It is reported that the meeting lasted about two hours, but no results were achieved. It is said that Zhou Enlai did not engage in any activities all day.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Representatives Zeng Qi, Zhang Junmai, Chen Qitian, Mo Dehui, Wang Yunwu, Shen Junru, Yu Jiaju, Zhang Shenfu, Liang Shuming, and others from the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and respected figures from society, gathered at the office of the Youth Party delegation at 4:00 PM on the 19th to discuss the current situation. After a long discussion, they reached the following conclusions: (1) It is hoped that the government will extend the ceasefire negotiation period so that the three issues can be fully agreed upon. (2) It is hoped that the CCP will agree to Marshall's arbitration method in order to truly implement the ceasefire. It is reported that they have also decided to separately invite representatives of the government and the CCP on the 20th to explain the aforementioned opinions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 19th] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei reiterated today the government's determination to take over Andong, Songjiang, Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, Xing'an, and Dalian after the ceasefire expires. Yu also said: The Communist troops "should be concentrated in areas where there will be no takeover work."</p>
<h3 id="e2">Hoping the Communist Side Considers the Suffering of the People, Promptly Jointly Promoting an Agreement, Minister Peng Speaks with Foreign Reporters <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 4:00 PM on the 19th in the Executive Yuan's conference room, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Cuo. Premier Song Ziwen also attended. The following is a record of Minister Peng's replies to the main questions:</p>
<p>Question: What is the current situation of the peace negotiations?</p>
<p>Peng replied: In recent days, Ambassador Marshall and representatives of the government have worked diligently, day and night. The plans proposed by the government have strived to be clear and concrete. Unfortunately, the CCP's replies have often been vague. In order to seek a quick solution, the government has continued to make concessions. It is hoped that the CCP will consider the suffering of the people and resolutely decide to jointly promote an early agreement. I hope the Committee of Three can meet in the next few days.</p>
<p>Question: Does the government insist that the Communist side must accept the proposal of arbitration as a prerequisite for a solution?</p>
<p>Peng replied: Any agreement must be effectively implemented within a certain period of time to be of value. In view of past experiences, the Communist side has often delayed, resulting in the indefinite implementation of agreements and the complete cancellation of their effectiveness. Therefore, this time, the government insists on authorizing the American representative with arbitration power in order to achieve a rapid and effective solution. As for the argument that this will damage China's sovereignty, it is a distortion. Historically, disputes between major countries have often been submitted to the Hague Tribunal for arbitration, and the arbitral judges are from third countries, which does not harm the sovereignty of any independent country. The American representative's arbitration is only temporary in nature. In fact, the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation of the Committee of Three already has an American representative in addition to the government and Communist Party representatives, and they are welcomed and admired by both the government and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Question: The government's strongholds in Shandong are under serious threat from Communist troops. What is the government's countermeasure in this regard? Is the government currently rushing reinforcements to Shandong by sea and air?</p>
<p>Peng replied: A detailed answer to this question can be found in the government's memorandum to the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation, which was published in today's newspapers. The number of troops originally stationed by the government in various parts of Shandong was very small, so the Communist troops were able to attack and seize territory without much effort. However, the government cannot stand idly by while important cities such as Jinan and Qingdao are attacked by Communist troops on the outskirts and heavily besieged. Protecting the territory and defending the people is the minimum responsibility of any government. This reinforcement is still defensive in nature for self-defense. The government hopes that the Communist troops will immediately stop the attack and withdraw from the cities that were forcibly occupied after June 7 in order to achieve a peaceful solution.</p>
<p>Question: Is it true that the government has submitted a memorandum of amendment to General Marshall regarding the February 25 agreement? Is the government willing to discuss the amendment of the proportion of troops stationed in the Northeast?</p>
<p>Peng replied: The government's proposal regarding the February 25 agreement stipulates the implementation method of the transportation restoration plan. In order to express its concession, the government has accepted most of the Communist side's demands regarding transportation issues. As for the proportion of troops in the Northeast, the government has also made important concessions to promote a rapid solution.</p>
<p>Question: Is it true that the Communist Party is demanding three ministries in the government, including the Ministry of Interior?</p>
<p>Peng replied: During the 15-day period, both parties focused on discussing the three issues raised in President Chiang's ceasefire order, and did not discuss other issues.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Guangzhou Announces Alert, Strictly Preventing Communist Troops' Riots <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 18th] A spokesman for the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters announced today that the CCP is attempting to riot in Guangzhou, so the military and political authorities here have to conduct house-to-house searches and announce an alert. More stringent measures may be taken in the future, but residents will feel inconvenienced. At the same time, British Consul Hall and Foreign Ministry Commissioner Guo Dehua went to Hong Kong today to discuss the matter of the National Daily being fined and suspended.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] The number of CCP armed personnel in Guangdong is about 2,000 on both sides of the Dongjiang River, and they are now concentrated in Dapeng Bay. Wang Zuoyao and other troops of the Beijiang River, about 900 people, are also moving south and are expected to arrive at Dapeng Bay around the 25th.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Premier Song's Talk Explains Economic Policy <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Premier of the Executive Yuan Zhu Ziwen attended the Central Propaganda Department's press conference for the first time at 5:00 PM on the 19th and answered the following questions from our reporter in a sincere and clear tone: (1) Question: During the current peace negotiations, I wonder if the Premier has discussed the relationship between the domestic economy, finance, prices, and the people's livelihood, as well as the CCP's indiscriminate issuance of banknotes in various places. Has the government made plans in advance for the future handling of this kind of "resistance currency"? Answer: Once the military, political, and transportation issues negotiated between the government and the CCP are settled, this issue can also be easily resolved. As for the future handling of "resistance currency" and other types of banknotes issued by the CCP that are similar to "resistance currency," it concerns the national economy, and the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance are carefully studying and preparing for it. (2) Question: It is hoped that the Premier will hold a press conference at the Executive Yuan once a week or every two weeks, where the Premier will personally report on the main tasks that have been completed, are pending, or are being planned, and answer reporters' questions so that the people can have a clear understanding of the major national policies. Answer: Because I am busy with my duties and do not engage in publicity, I rarely interact with the outside world. Therefore, those who do not have much contact with my administrative affairs will inevitably feel isolated. In the future, I am willing to fully answer questions from everyone and the outside world at various regular or irregular gatherings in order to gain insight.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] Premier Song issued a statement today explaining China's economic policy, responding to attacks from the media, and predicting that if the current negotiations can achieve lasting peace, then this policy "will be able to rebuild economic stability in a short period of time." Song attributed China's economic and other ills to the result of the eight-year war followed by the civil war, which disrupted transportation and prevented the smooth flow of food and goods. He described the recent article in the American "Time" magazine that accused China of living under an "incestuous economic system" as an "exposure of obscene thoughts." Song answered the accusations in "Time Weekly" one by one, denying that the government was engaged in commercial activities that squeezed out private enterprises.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Content of Government's Memorandum to the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Hoping the Communist Troops Fulfill the Agreement, Otherwise They Should Be Responsible for the Destruction. Transporting Troops to Qingdao and Jinan is Defensive in Nature for Self-Defense</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The main points of the government's memorandum to the Peiping Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation are as follows: "After the January 10th ceasefire agreement this year, in order to earnestly fulfill the agreement and carry out the original intention of peaceful nation-building, the government stopped advancing and mobilizing troops, and at the same time, in accordance with the troop reorganization and unified reorganization agreement, greatly reduced the number of troops. Unexpectedly, the Communist troops took advantage of this opportunity to violate the agreement from the beginning, mobilized troops on a large scale, and attacked or besieged the National Army everywhere. They successively captured Jining in Suiyuan, Jianping in Rehe, Houma in Shanxi, Yutian and Dongming in Hebei, Mingshui and Longshan in Shandong, Xiayi in Henan, attacked northern Jiangsu several times, constantly destroyed transportation, and besieged more than 17 towns and cities guarded by the National Army. They have always refused to lift the siege in accordance with the mediation agreement, and actively blockaded materials, cut off the livelihood of the military and civilians, and prohibited people from traveling in and out. In order to seek peace sincerely, the government has repeatedly tolerated and has always been in a passive self-defense state. In all areas within the scope of the agreement, no troops have been transferred to reinforce. Until the 6th of this month, after the government reiterated the ceasefire order, the Communist troops still took advantage of this ceasefire opportunity and suddenly launched a full-scale offensive in North China, Central China, and the Northeast from the 7th of this month, with Shandong being the worst. The important strongholds they captured in Shandong were Zhangdian, Zhoucun, Dezhou, Tai'an, Zaozhuang, Gaomi, Jiaoxian, Nanquan, Lancun, Zhilanzhuang, and many other cities and towns. At the same time, they destroyed the Hanzhuang Canal Railway Bridge (this bridge was repaired after the ceasefire) at the junction of Jiangsu and Shandong. In this situation, the government has repeatedly tolerated, hoping to give the Communist Party another opportunity to seek peace, and has never taken active measures. However, the Communist troops did not think this was enough, and instead gathered 50,000 troops on the outskirts of Qingdao and more than 100,000 troops on the outskirts of Jinan, and continued to increase them, fiercely besieging the near suburbs of the two cities. In particular, the situation in Nanquan and Huangbu, the water source of Qingdao, was extremely dangerous, and the island and the Cangshan Airport were also threatened. As for the coal and grain areas of Jinan, the blockade was even more severe, and they have recently approached the suburbs of Jinan City, such as Dangjiazhuang and Geshang, causing the situation in these places to be extremely critical, and the livelihood of the military and civilians is becoming increasingly precarious. The government has repeatedly reminded the Communist troops to pay attention and demanded that they stop the attack, but they have ignored it. Now, for the absolute need of self-defense, it has been forced to transport the 54th Army to Qingdao and the 73rd Army to Jinan. However, this move by the government is still defensive in nature for self-defense. It is still hoped that the Communist troops can quickly realize their mistakes, immediately stop the attack, abide by the ceasefire agreement, and resolve the issue by peaceful means. They should immediately withdraw from the cities occupied after the ceasefire and return them to the government to show their sincerity in fulfilling the agreement and seeking peace, otherwise, the Communist troops should be responsible for destroying peace and all the misfortunes that occur as a result.</p>
<p>[US News Agency, Peiping, 19th] The government and Communist Party members and American representatives of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation issued the following statement today: "Recent reports in newspapers have stated that the government representative of the Executive Headquarters has announced the abolition of the 15-day ceasefire agreement. This is a rumor and is absolutely inaccurate. The heads of the conflict control teams of the Executive Headquarters, the Nationalists, the Communists, and the United States held a meeting and commented on the telegram from General Du Weiming. The above rumor may have arisen from this, but none of the three committee members attended this meeting. The newspaper has exaggerated the above comments and misinterpreted them. In order to avoid hindering the current mediation work, the three committee members sincerely hope to correct all parties' persuasion through this joint statement."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] After the abolition of the Ministry of Military Service, the new agency responsible for peacetime military service has not yet been established. It is reported that General Lin Wei, Vice Minister of the Ministry of National Defense, convened a conference similar to the peacetime military service design conference yesterday to begin studying the organization and personnel issues related to the new military service agency.

Several important cases were resolved at the conference. It is rumored that the new military service agencies at all levels will establish 42 military districts, more than 100 division districts, and more than 200 regiment districts. It is also rumored that the candidates for the commanders of the above-mentioned military, division, and regiment districts will be selected from among the surplus military and division district chiefs who are well-versed in academics and have combat merits. It is currently determined that more than 700 senior military officers are planned to be appointed, exceeding two-thirds of the personnel required. Their qualifications are being strictly reviewed. Once the review is passed, they will be sent to the Senior Military Service Class of the Central Training Corps for training. The director of the class is Lieutenant General Li Yaliang, the former attaché of the Military Training Department.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Ambassador Wei Will Go to Beijing Today; States That the U.S. Aims to Help Our Revival; Overseas Chinese Hope That Domestic Problems Will Be Resolved Soon <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency This City News] Wei Daoming, our ambassador to the United States, is scheduled to go to Beijing today to report on his work. Yesterday, Wei met with reporters and spoke freely about Sino-U.S. relations. He said that China has undergone eight years of war, and the duration of the war is longer than that of any other country, so the losses suffered are also the greatest, and the difficulties are even greater. This is something that all countries should recognize. Wei believes that the U.S. policy towards China has been consistent and unchanged. Although there is criticism of us, it is all well-intentioned, and its purpose is to help China revive as soon as possible. American personnel have expressed their support for the mediation work of Special Envoy Marshall and believe that Marshall's mission must be completed. Secondly, the work of the U.S. military in China to help us repatriate Japanese residents and prisoners of war, and to help us transport troops, is actually carrying out missions in accordance with the original plan. This is one of the U.S. policies in China after Japan surrendered, and its purpose is to help strengthen our transportation work. Wei reiterated that the US$500 million loan will be realized in the near future. The reason for the delay is that there are still minor details that have not been resolved. As for what the minor details are, Wei did not answer. The negotiation of the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty has been progressing smoothly in Chongqing and Nanjing, and the issues are very broad. Ambassador Wei also expressed his views after returning to China this time. He emphasized that China's economic problems today are very serious, and the degree of difficulty is more than that of other countries. The main problem is the dual difficulty of material distribution and sources. This is a difficult situation formed by the eight-year long-term war of resistance, but he firmly believes that the solution to domestic economic problems is very optimistic. Wei said that the current stage is the most difficult stage. Adjusting prices and circulating materials will require considerable effort and time, but with the end of the war, military demobilization has been gradually completed. Previously, military demobilization affected transportation, but now this phenomenon has gradually decreased, and the number of transportation ships has increased, transportation tools have improved, industrial recovery has been completed, and economic difficulties have been fundamentally resolved, so the future is bright. As for the point that too many foreign materials have severely hit domestic industries, Wei said that the government should urgently seek remedial measures. When reporters inquired about the general situation of overseas Chinese in the United States, the ambassador said that there are about 50,000 overseas Chinese in the United States, all of whom hope that domestic problems will be resolved soon. Finally, when reporters inquired whether he would become the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wei said that he could not answer this question before going to Beijing.</p>
<p>[Huadong News Agency] Since Wei Daoming, our ambassador to the United States, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 17th, many people have visited him, mostly from the judicial community, including Zhu Nianci, the presiding judge of the Shanghai District Court, Xie Zhiying, a judge, and Zhou Zhenhua, a judge of the Taipei District Court. Wei said that Zhu Nianci and others were all classmates of law and political science, and that the alma mater had purchased 300 mu of land in Yangchan, so it was necessary to actively work to build a new school building. In the future, he hoped to add a journalism department to help promote the rule of law and cultivate talents, and encouraged Zhu and others to maintain the glory of law and political science in history and to inform the general students to unite and serve the country, society, and the people.</p>

<p>The local "Dazhong Bao" newspaper was forced to cease publication and its editorial office was destroyed for publishing a news item about middle school students in the county being suspended from meals and school for failing to pay the full amount of rice rations. The president of the newspaper, Wu Baozhong, was detained. The local authorities have failed to properly mediate the situation. The newspaper has not only filed lawsuits with the judicial authorities for obstructing physical freedom, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press, but has also requested the colleagues in the press to uphold justice and provide assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e34">The Economic Problems of China <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Dequan</p>
<p>The whole country is currently troubled by the issue of prices! Prices are rising frequently, the people's lives are becoming more difficult, and they are in a state of constant anxiety. The industrial sector, on the other hand, is complaining that the exchange rate is too low, that domestic products cannot compete with the cheap and high-quality foreign goods, and that they fear their own imminent collapse. Speculators are taking advantage of this psychology, spreading rumors, adding fuel to the fire, and stirring up a surge in gold and foreign exchange. Those who do not understand this hear it and are either happy or worried. In fact, the price problem and the exchange rate problem are two sides of the same coin. The value of money is expressed internally by prices and externally by exchange rates. According to common sense, the purchasing power of money domestically must be balanced with its purchasing power abroad. At a time when the domestic purchasing power of money is not yet stable, to speculate on changes in the exchange rate is like sitting in a well and looking at the sky.</p>
<p>Take today as an example. If the exchange rate is raised, it will only stimulate domestic price increases and further reduce the purchasing power of legal tender. Conversely, if the government implements the current foreign exchange policy of keeping the exchange rate fixed in order to lower domestic prices and bring the domestic purchasing power of legal tender closer to its external purchasing power, this may be effective for a time, but it is ultimately not a good policy. Although the central bank has a huge amount of foreign exchange reserves, using these funds to fill a bottomless pit will be difficult. Once the foreign exchange reserves are exhausted, the exchange rate will inevitably skyrocket, domestic prices will again be out of control, and the previous efforts will be completely wasted. Moreover, domestic enterprises will collapse even before the foreign exchange reserves are used up because they cannot compete with the dumping of foreign goods. Therefore, the current solution to China's economic problems should be to address both the price problem and the exchange rate problem simultaneously in order to achieve success.</p>
<p>To stabilize domestic prices, the first step is to increase the supply of production goods. There are two ways to increase the supply of production goods: restore domestic industries and encourage the import of foreign goods to compensate for the insufficient domestic production. This is the active approach. On the passive side, we should encourage the public to start a frugal and conservation movement to reduce consumer goods. At the same time, the government should stop issuing additional currency to slow down the velocity of currency circulation and promote lower prices.</p>
<p>The key to China's current production problems mainly lies in the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Traffic is blocked and transportation is inconvenient. The procurement of raw materials and the sale of production goods often make it difficult for enterprises to profit due to high prices. Once they encounter foreign competition, they are even less likely to be able to compete. Therefore, unimpeded transportation is urgently needed today, and the government authorities have an unshirkable responsibility. Whoever wants to disrupt traffic and obstruct transportation today is an enemy of China's production industry.</p>
<p>(2) Wages are too high, reducing corporate profits. Chinese workers' wages were traditionally known to be low in the world. Therefore, when unequal treaties existed, foreigners set up factories in our country, taking advantage of our country's low labor costs, and our country's production industry, although technologically backward, could still barely survive because of low wages. Today, the wages of some Chinese workers are actually higher than those of American workers, coupled with various other difficult problems in production, how can they compete with foreign goods? Therefore, wages should be reduced appropriately. However, the reduction of wages should be conditional on suppressing prices first. When prices fall, wages will naturally fall accordingly, and workers' lives will not feel difficult. Conversely, when prices are high, wages are also high. Wages and prices follow each other in a causal cycle, which will inevitably stifle all enterprises. Looking at the labor unrest and price surges of the previous month, they often went hand in hand, and the reason is obvious.</p>
<p>(3) Interest rates are too high. When raising funds, the business community is suffering from the burden of high interest rates, which is also an important reason for the increase in production costs. The government should provide long-term, low-interest loans to important domestic production industries according to their needs to reduce their production costs. When necessary, the government should also provide production subsidies to certain domestic industries to enhance their competitiveness in the international market.</p>
<p>The benefits of international trade, in addition to adjusting the surplus of international production, are to promote the international division of labor. For goods that a country cannot produce or is uneconomical to produce, it should take advantage of foreign industries that are in a relatively economic position. The people of the country can obtain the same enjoyment at a lower price, and at the same time, they can devote their full efforts to engage in other industries that are particularly suitable for domestic production, and engage in mass production with a favorable environment and low costs. In addition to supplying domestic needs, they should also try to sell abroad as much as possible. Before the war, although countries implemented tariff barrier policies due to political relations, international trade has always been prosperous and not tired, because there are undeniable benefits in it. However, encouraging imports is not blind, and must be carefully planned in advance, and it is selective.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about stabilizing exchange rates. The thorough way to stabilize exchange rates is to seek a balance of international payments, in other words, the inflow and outflow of foreign exchange must be balanced. If a country has a long-term trade deficit, it will inevitably lead to the expenditure of huge amounts of gold, which will lead to the poverty of the country and the decline of the people. If we want to achieve a balance of international payments, we must have a certain policy on the entire international trade, not only have a comprehensive plan for international payments, but also bring the function of international trade to its peak. As for how to use international trade policy, just look at how to use tariff policy.</p>
<p>China should make full use of tariff policy for the import of foreign goods into the country, which is self-evident. For goods that the country cannot produce or is uneconomical to produce, the government should only levy low import duties for the purpose of financial revenue. For products whose domestic production is insufficient, the government should limit their import volume, and levy heavy taxes on amounts exceeding the limit. For foreign goods that are in competition with domestic products, very high tariffs should be levied, or even their import should be prohibited, in order to protect domestic industries. The import of luxury goods and the like should be absolutely prohibited in order to save the country's foreign exchange. Now that unequal treaties have been abolished, tariffs are already autonomous and unrestrained. Extreme tariff barrier policies can certainly lead to foreign countries taking the same retaliatory measures, but if our country implements this kind of tariff policy to protect its immature industries, there are many precedents in the history of world trade, and it will not cause misunderstandings among countries.</p>
<p>Our country's agricultural, mineral, and handicraft products that are sold all over the world include tea, silk, tung oil, eggs, pork bristles, sausage casings, tin, textiles, and embroidery, which are very popular in various countries. Now, it is simply too expensive to export them. The government cannot ignore this phenomenon, and it should be given assistance now. In addition to exempting export taxes, export subsidies should also be given to promote their vigorous export sales. Manufactured industrial products are sold in the South Pacific Islands, and we cannot sit idly by and watch the loss of this good market today. We should eliminate the various bottlenecks of production problems, encourage production, and encourage exports, which can be used to develop domestic industries and obtain foreign exchange from this to pay for the foreign exchange needed to import goods. At the same time, the government should strengthen the control of foreign exchange. Foreign currencies are absolutely not allowed to be used domestically, and importers and exporters must collect and settle foreign exchange to and from the central bank or its designated banks. Before the war, overseas Chinese remitted huge sums of money back to the motherland every year, which was also an important way for our country to obtain foreign exchange, so the government must provide sufficient convenience for the remittance of funds from overseas Chinese in order to encourage them.</p>
<p>In addition to determining the degree of assistance for certain products for export as needed, the nature of exports should be strictly determined by the Commodity Inspection Bureau. Only qualified products are allowed to be exported to avoid foreign countries from generating bad impressions. The investigation and statistics of the foreign market situation must also be reported regularly by our country's consulates abroad so that producers have a full understanding of the supply and demand situation in foreign markets. The government authorities should not only plan these various facilities to assist international trade today, but also strive to implement them.</p>
<p>Some people say that since the government must stop the policy of currency inflation, where does the huge amount of money come from? Since customs duties were not fully autonomous under the shackles of unequal treaties and the tax rate was low, now that unequal treaties have been abolished and customs duties are already autonomous, under the implementation of the tariff policy system, low tariffs are levied on imports that the country cannot produce or is uneconomical to produce. At the same time, extremely high tariffs are levied on imported goods that are in competition with domestic products. On the one hand, prohibition is implied in the levy, and on the other hand, the revenue is used to pay for subsidies. This amount must be considerable.</p>
<p>China's production industry has been gradually collapsing in the past few months due to its inability to compete with the continuous flow of cheap foreign goods. If we do not rise up and rescue it urgently, the tragic consequences will befall us! China has a population of 450 million, accounting for one-fifth of the world's total population, and is known for its vast land and abundant resources. China is the best market in the world, and the Chinese people are good customers for the world's commodities. Once the Chinese economy collapses, the impact will be enough to affect the entire world economy. China's prosperity is closely related to the world's prosperity. As long as our government officials are sincere and honest, plan for the country, and urgently seek remedies to revive China's economy, not only will domestic elites be able to stand up and help, but allied authorities will also be able to understand and give assistance, and will never hinder our legitimate measures.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Disagreements Arise Again Among the Four Foreign Ministers; Shadows Loom Over the Paris Conference Again; The Italian Reparations Issue Remains Deadlocked; Easier Issues Discussed Yesterday <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 19th (Radio): Two hours ago (11:00 p.m. Shanghai time), the four major powers' foreign ministers continued their meeting in Paris, discussing several smaller issues related to Italy and the French-Italian border issue. The meeting is in progress, and the results are unknown.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 19th] The four foreign ministers discussing the Italian peace treaty are still deadlocked on the issue of Italian reparations. The agenda item approved for today is several small economic issues and the French-Italian border issue, which are relatively easy to resolve. The four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet at 2:00 p.m. today (11:00 p.m. Shanghai time), one hour earlier than usual, to allow French Foreign Minister Bidault to attend the Constitutional Assembly. At yesterday's meeting, the four foreign ministers could not reach an agreement on the issue of Italian reparations, causing the pessimistic atmosphere among all parties to deepen.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 18th] The four foreign ministers discussed the issue of Italian reparations today for two and a half hours, but still did not reach a result. Bevin suggested that the major powers should give up their claims for Italian reparations and help its democratic government. Molotov still expressed his dissent. Byrnes suggested that the entire issue be transferred to the European Peace Conference for discussion.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Paris, 19th] Yesterday evening, when the four major powers' foreign ministers held a meeting, the British proposal on the Italian issue was opposed by the Soviet Union, thus forming a new deadlock. Britain suggested that the four major powers give up all claims for Italian reparations. Molotov insisted that the Soviet Union must obtain US$200 million in reparations from the former Axis countries and submitted a resolution to the Paris Conference. As for the reparations, most of them should be taken from the current Italian production sector. Byrnes adopted a strong stance on the Soviet Union's attitude, replying that the meaning of this move was nothing more than to give the millions of dollars in American aid to Italy to the Soviet Union. Molotov then made a slight concession, saying that he was willing to accept Italy's luxury cruise ships "Saturnia" and "Vulcania" as part of the US$100 million reparations claim.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 18th] The Foreign Ministers' Conference did not reach an agreement on the Italian reparations issue today, but the opinions are more flexible than before. Byrnes and Bevin still advocated that the US$100 million demanded by the Soviet Union could be paid by Italy's property in hostile territories and domestically, as well as Italian merchant ships and warships. Molotov insisted that it was not enough to pay the US$100 million, and the shortfall still needed to be made up by Italy's existing production within six years. Bidault believed that Italy could do it if this period could start within two years. Bevin opposed both the Soviet and French proposals, believing that this claim was tantamount to invalidating the clause on granting the United Nations "most-favored-nation" treatment agreed upon yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 18th] Bevin has drafted a new plan to break the deadlock on the Italian southern border issue and will submit it to the Foreign Ministers' Conference within the next two days. The plan suggests that Trieste and its surrounding areas be designated as a neutral territory under the direct control of the United Nations.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Western Democratic Countries Can No Longer Make Concessions to the Soviet Union; The New York Times Publishes a Harsh Criticism of the Soviet Union; and Expresses Frank Pessimism About the Foreign Ministers' Conference <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 17th] The New York Times editorial accused the Soviet Union with an unprecedented two-line headline. It stated that if the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference cannot make rapid and definite progress in drafting peace treaties in accordance with the hopes of Europe, which is "hungry and war-torn," then the Western democratic countries can no longer surrender to the Soviet Union and allow it to infinitely obstruct peace and hinder their own leadership. The New York Times also gave the most straightforward criticism of Soviet foreign policy. It said that since the Tehran Conference, in international power politics, the Soviet Union has demanded the greatest concessions from its Western allies, but has not reciprocated with concessions to the opinions of its allies. It has then proceeded to include what it has gained, and has only issued unilateral actions, even without the approval of its allies or in accordance with peaceful solutions. The Soviet Union's policy of unilaterally expanding its power is undoubtedly a violation of the Atlantic Charter. The newspaper finally expressed frank pessimism about the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference and endorsed Byrnes' suggestion that if the Paris Conference fails again, the peace treaty issue should be submitted to the 21-nation peace conference or the United Nations for discussion, because work related to the whole world must continue and cannot wait alone for a certain power. After the above was published, Moscow newspapers and radio broadcasts criticized American policy. It should be noted that the New York Times editorial represents an important part of American public opinion and is highly regarded because it can reflect the opinions of the American authorities to a certain extent.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>Foster's article begins by saying that the Soviet Union values economic equality and extremely disregards individual freedom. Therefore, American diplomats cannot use the American perspective of individual freedom and development to observe or criticize the Soviet Union. However, he says that the Soviet Union now prioritizes security, fearing the combined power of Britain and the United States to destroy its homeland. Foster divides the Soviet Union into three zones: the Russian homeland as the core, then extending outward to the middle defense zone, and then to the outer zone. According to Foster, the Soviet Union's various actions in Europe and Asia, such as "aggression," are all aimed at strengthening its middle defense zone.</p>
<p>Lacking Understanding of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>I have no idea how much influence this article can have. Anyway, in American society today, being able to say a little something about the "Soviet Union" is considered the most intelligent thing. The words and actions of several "Russian experts" at Columbia University are now attracting attention in American society. Some say that Americans do not understand China. Indeed, Americans still have many misunderstandings about China. However, Americans' lack of understanding of the Soviet Union is probably a hundred times deeper than their lack of understanding of China. Starting this autumn, Columbia University will establish a special "Soviet Russian Academy," to which government officials from the State Department, various ministries, and the General Staff will be sent for study. It will not accept ordinary students, and foreign students are even less welcome.</p>
<p>In the hundreds of bookstores in New York, it is more difficult to buy books about the Soviet Union than in London. However, most of the books and pamphlets about the Soviet Union on the London market are propaganda, either pro-communist or anti-communist. Comprehensive works of a more specialized nature, like those written by the Webbs in the past, are also rarely seen. In April and May of this year, one of the books with the highest sales in New York was called "I Chose Freedom," which is a rather interesting and good book depicting the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>That book was only published at the beginning of this year. The author, Kravenko, was originally a Ukrainian from Russia. His father was a communist revolutionary, so Kravenko was instilled with communist ideology from a young age. From the Lenin era to the Stalin era, he had always been a loyal member of the Communist Party and worked in a metallurgical factory. Because of his intelligence and hard work, he rose from worker to foreman, and from foreman to metallurgical engineer. After Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, he joined the Red Army and served as the captain of an engineer corps. Soon, he was sent to the United States by the Russian government to serve as a member of the Purchasing Committee in the United States. Suddenly, on April 4, 1944, Kravenko disappeared in Washington, D.C., and broke away from the Communist Party. At that time, American newspapers published his mysterious disappearance like a detective novel. It was not until recently that he publicly published this "confession" of hundreds of thousands of words.</p>
<p>Two Perspectives on China</p>
<p>In an environment where economic equality and individual freedom cannot coexist, Kravenko's experience tells readers that he chooses the latter. Therefore, his book is called "I Chose Freedom." It is an extremely honest report. He describes many strengths of the Soviet Union, but also exposes all the dark secrets of the Soviet Communist Party's dictatorship. He said that he had always tolerated and kept silent about these unacceptable things, and only gained liberation after arriving in the United States. The author confidently states that the Soviet Union was able to achieve final victory in this war not because of the Soviet system, but because of the miracle of the Russian nation's patriotism.</p>
<p>The same theory as Kravenko's now seems to be gradually becoming widespread in the United States. After the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference ended, Republican Senator Vandenberg, in a broadcast speech after returning to the United States, repeatedly emphasized the theoretical opposition and the practical contradiction between communism and democracy. One left-leaning newspaper scolded Vandenberg for lacking common sense. That newspaper said that the opposite of communism is capitalism, and the opposite of democracy is dictatorship, saying that Vandenberg was being naive and nonsensical. I don't know who is being naive? And who is being nonsensical?</p>
<p>The New York "Afternoon Post" attacked the American delegation to the Paris Conference most fiercely. Several of the "Afternoon Post's" star editorial writers, such as Guggs and Lyner, published several articles one after another, saying that Byrnes was taking gambler-like risks in diplomacy. They said that Byrnes was essentially incapable of breaking the deadlock in relations with the Soviet Union, except by risking leading the United States into a third war. On the other hand, a "declaration" led by famous reporter Powell and Admiral Yarnell斥斥斥 Byrnes for being incapable of solving the Far East problem and obstructing China's unified nation-building.</p>
<p>In fact, the diplomacy towards China cannot be blamed on the State Department. In fact, none of General Marshall's reports went through the State Department; they were all directly given to President Truman. There is a rumor circulating in the Washington State Department that before General Marshall went to China, he consulted with former Ambassador Hurley. General Hurley's heartfelt words were just this one sentence: "Don't let these things be known to those guys in the State Department." General Hurley looked down on those "old farts," the American professional diplomats. General Hurley said that they have two perspectives on China: either the traditional imperialist perspective, or the revitalized communist perspective.</p>
<p>I have no way to investigate the internal situation of the State Department. In fact, it is also inappropriate for a foreign journalist to try his best to investigate the inside story of the diplomatic administrative organization of the country in which he is stationed. However, in any case, the work of the US State Department today is more burdensome than at any time in the past. Therefore, there are also more external accusations and criticisms than at any time in the past.</p>
<p>However, none of these are enough to create a "gulf" between the President and the Secretary of State. Mr. Truman would not transfer away a Secretary of State whose political views are the same as his own, and accommodate another person to implement his foreign policy. Because, in the minds of Americans today, or in the American political circles, the Democratic government inherited by Truman fairly represents the "right wing." His shift to the right in policy has not gone too far in diplomacy. However, in domestic affairs, since this strike wave, it has already caused a great commotion. (The End)</p>

<p>[United States Information Service, Williamstown, Massachusetts, 18th] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal delivered a speech at William College here on the 16th, discussing the American way of life, stating that the essence of American life, whether in one place, one state, or the whole country, is that the government serves the individual, and is not the master of the individual. He also said: Today, we cannot isolate ourselves from the world. The flames of war that arise in the Middle East, India, or the Balkans will inevitably have a profound impact on our lives. A hundred years ago, we could close our doors and not ask about foreign affairs, but today, with the development of science and the acceleration of transportation, as the Secretary of State recently said: "Unless we understand that peace is indivisible, we will be forced to participate in a global war." Today, there are two major forces in the world challenging human thought: one is the force of democracy, and the other is the issue of centralized government power. The story of democracy can only be believed by people who have sufficient physical and mental faith to govern themselves willingly. People can only care about abstract things such as free government and individual freedom after they are well-fed and clothed. Hunger, a state without dare government, and economic chaos are fertile ground for the growth of dictatorships. We know that the United States has no intention of conquering territory or other selfish intentions. We must declare our motives to the world as a light of hope in the darkness. We hope that the light of freedom, tolerance, and peace will once again shine on the whole world.</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] The United Nations Security Council today discussed the issue of referring the Spanish question to the United Nations General Assembly. The Soviet Union strongly opposed the majority and used its veto power. This is the first time that the United Nations organization has used its veto power since it started working in the United States. In the Security Council, the compromise proposal put forward by the subcommittee, which advocated that the General Assembly propose severing relations with the Franco government in September this year, or taking other appropriate actions, was approved by nine votes to one. The Netherlands abstained during the voting. The Chairman, Mexican representative Najera, announced that the proposal had been vetoed. Polish representative Lange then requested that his proposal made in April, which called for the United Nations to immediately and completely sever relations with Franco, be put to a vote, but the Chairman said that the Council did not intend to discuss the Polish proposal and announced an adjournment until Monday afternoon of next week. Earlier, Soviet representative Gromyko declared that the Council had broad powers to order the severance of relations with Spain, and it was its duty to not shirk it to the United Nations General Assembly. U.S. Representative Johnson expressed his support for the compromise proposal put forward by Evatt, saying that the Council's adoption of this action was most appropriate, and that this seat also played a strong role in the drafting of this proposal.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 18th] The United Nations Security Council met today, and the United States opposed the British amendment to submit the Spanish question to the September General Assembly meeting, but did not make any suggestions.</p>
<p>Economic and Social Council Passes Soviet Proposal</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] The Soviet Union advocated that the economic and social plans of the United Nations organization should be drafted by government representatives, and should not be chaired by non-governmental experts. The Economic and Social Council passed the proposal yesterday by a vote of eleven to five. Britain and the United States opposed the Soviet proposal, while China supported it. India and Norway abstained.</p>
<p>International Organization for Relief Work Group</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council today advocated that international relief work should be extended to German and Austrian Jews, as well as other foreigners and stateless people living outside the two countries. The Council rejected the proposal by the British representative by a vote of six to four, which would not include foreigners and stateless people residing in Germany and Austria within the scope of relief. At the same time, it passed a compromise proposal put forward by France by a vote of six to five, proposing that the international relief organization to be organized will have a certain interpretation of those it regards as "refugees." It is said that the so-called "refugees" refer to "Jews, or foreigners or stateless people residing in Germany and Austria, who have been detained in the two countries due to hostile acts or environmental conditions, or who have fled from the two countries and eventually returned to the country, and who have not yet definitively settled in the two countries."</p>

<p>[United Press, Rome, 18th] The Italian Supreme Court today ruled in simple terms that the Republic won over the Monarchy in the June 2 referendum.

<h3 id="e49">Japan's Military Training for Young People Is Indeed Aggressive: Testimony of Professor Ouchi of Tokyo Imperial University; Six U.S. Defense Attorneys Resignations Approved <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] The International Court continued to try Japanese war criminals today. Witness Ouchi, a professor of economics at Tokyo Imperial University, appeared in court. According to the new procedure, Ouchi prepared a statement in advance, which was read out in court by the prosecutor. It stated that Japanese military training instilled the spirit of military force and the glory of war in young people across the country, and even induced young people to believe that this was necessary for Japan's future happiness. In 1890, Emperor Meiji issued an edict, which began to spread the idea of military force and extreme nationalism in Japanese schools. One of the dogmas stated that "dying for the Great Emperor is the greatest glory." As a result, during the Pacific War, thousands and thousands of Japanese soldiers were drunk and crazy, and did not hesitate to bleed to practice this belief. The authorities asked teachers from all schools to fully cooperate in establishing aggressive ideas, otherwise they would be dismissed or imprisoned. Former Minister of the Interior, Kido, forced a university professor who wrote articles advocating peace to resign. In 1938, when Araki served as Minister of Education, he implemented compulsory military training in universities. Seven years ago, when Araki served as Minister of the Army, he asked Tokyo Imperial University to open a military affairs training class, but it was unsuccessful. In 1937, seven university professors, many teaching assistants, and Ouchi himself were dismissed because they were suspected of sympathizing with peaceful ideas. They were also detained by the police. After Japan surrendered, the university invited them to resume teaching. However, he said that Araki had nothing to do with his dismissal.</p>

<p>Police Department Yesterday Summoned Five More Grain Merchants: Jurisdiction Issue Divided into Two Parts</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] It is learned that the Garrison Command Investigation Department, together with the Municipal Government Investigation Office and police officers, were dispatched yesterday to seal off several rice shops related to the grain loan case and the rice stored in various warehouses. Those sealed off include: (1) San Tai Rice Shop at 353 Jiangxi Road, Room 105, and 6,722 bags of rice stored in the Bank of China warehouse. It is reported that 3,350 bags are stored in the name of Xie Daheng Rice Shop. (2) Changjiang Company at 97 Zhongzheng East Road and 150 bags of rice stored in the Bank of China warehouse and 40 bags of rice stored in the China Trust Company warehouse. (3) Housheng Company at 97 Zhongzheng East Road and 1,103 bags of rice stored in the China Industrial Bank warehouse, 296 bags of rice in Dinghe Warehouse, and 567 bags of rice stored in the Dakang Bank warehouse. It is reported that the Housheng Company's office is located within the Changjiang Company and is actually a branch company of Changjiang Company.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command continued to summon five grain merchants yesterday afternoon: Wan of Wanchang Rice Shop, Xing Songwen of Jiangbei Company, Yang Runyu of Wanchang Xin Rice Shop, Xu Taiyuan of Zhifeng Rice Shop, and Wang Yuzhen of Huifeng Company. At this point, all rice merchants related to the grain loan case have been questioned. A comprehensive overall review of the case will begin today.</p>
<p>Wang Daren Detained in Temporary Detention Center: Listed as Inmate Number 1382</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Prosecutor Wu of the District Prosecutor's Office, considering that Wang Daren (Shanghai native, 41 years old), the main suspect in the case, had not yet been summoned for interrogation, specifically sent a letter to the Garrison Command to transfer him. After Xuan Tiewu approved it, Wang was escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office on Xuehuali Road at around 4:00 PM yesterday. Prosecutor Wu Qihua and Clerk Wang immediately conducted an interrogation. He was then ordered by the judicial police to be detained in the temporary detention center of the Shanghai District Court near the District Prosecutor's Office, listed as inmate number 1382.</p>
<p>Xu Kan May Appear as a Witness</p>
<p>Reporters from the East China News Agency went to various related parties yesterday to inquire about the details of the grain loan case, as follows: (1) The investigation of this case was personally ordered by Chairman Chiang, and it was conducted jointly by the Military Intelligence Bureau, the Central Bureau of Statistics, and the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command, with Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu responsible for presiding over the investigation. In accordance with Chairman Chiang's instructions, the investigation was completed within ten days, and it was completed as of yesterday. (2) The Grain Administration once declared that it would sell 11,000 dan, entrusting San Tai Rice Shop and others to sell it, but the result was delayed for more than ten days, causing rice prices to soar. (3) The grain loan rice was traded back and forth among the grain loan merchants without being sold on the market. (4) During the investigation, Wang Daren attributed everything to being done under the orders of Minister Xu, and it is feared that the Garrison Command will ask Xu Kan to testify.</p>
<p>Jurisdictional Issues</p>
<p>[Another Report] The trial procedure for the grain loan case has encountered divergences because the District Prosecutor's Office and the Military Law Office are conducting trials simultaneously. There is great attention to whether the case should be tried by military law or handled by the judiciary. The reporter specifically visited Prosecutor Wu Qihua of the District Prosecutor's Office, who is handling the case, yesterday. According to the interview: The handling of the grain loan case can be divided into two parts, that is, Chairman's order: all cases of hoarding grain and speculating to raise prices will be tried by military law, and the part of corruption by public officials, because they are not military personnel, should be resolved by the judicial organs. This is based on the impeachment by the Jiangsu District Cheng Supervisory Envoy, and they are currently contacting the relevant agencies to clarify the judicial procedure. Regarding the defendant Yang Xizhi, who is detained in the United States and has not returned, the office has sent a letter to the Ministry of Food, and a subpoena has been sent with the letter, requesting it to be delivered on his behalf, so that he arrives in court on time. Wang Daren, the defendant detained by the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command, has also been requested by letter from the office to be transferred to the office for investigation. In the end, it was said: The date of the retrial of this case is set for 9:00 AM on the 24th of this month. Subpoenas have been issued to ten grain loan merchants, including Xie Changtai Zhu Shilu, Xinchang Zhu Yongming, Tongcheng Chuan Changyu, Xie Daheng Feng Yongsheng, Qianchang Yu Yuliangji, Hengtai Zhang Chao, Tongyi Company Lu Linxun, San Tai Company, Huifeng Company, and Changjiang Company, to appear in court for interrogation on that day. After that, several more rigorous investigations are required, and after the investigation is completed, a public prosecution will be filed in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Also, Li Chongnian, director of the Field Grain Office, the protagonist of the grain loan case, who was released on bail by the District Prosecutor's Office and the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command, went to Beijing yesterday morning, but if there is a summons from the District Prosecutor's Office and the Military Law Office, it is said that Li will arrive in court with the summons.</p>
<p>Zhang Daomin Speaks:</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The reporter recently visited Zhang Daomin, a counselor of the Ministry of Food, to inquire about the details of his coming to Shanghai to preside over the Shanghai Grain Storage and Transportation Office. According to the interview: He came to Shanghai this time under the order of Xu Kan, Minister of Food, in the capacity of counselor, to help preside over the affairs of the municipal Grain Storage and Transportation Office. On the one hand, he also came to take care of his family members in Shanghai. He said: The Grain Administration is still in the process of closing down, and it is expected to be completed by the end of the month. However, since the organizational regulations and staffing of the Storage and Transportation Office have not yet been issued, the details are not yet known. However, it is hoped that it will be established on July 1st. Before the office is formally established, he does not know the details and cannot make any statements. It is understood that after the establishment of the Storage and Transportation Office, it will specialize in the storage, transportation, and allocation of military grain. Therefore, the business is simpler than that of the Grain Administration. The number of staff will also be reduced compared to the Grain Administration.</p>
<p>Grain Management Under the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Mayor Wu, having heard that grain prices in the city are soaring and the grain problem is serious, the Municipal Government decided to transfer grain management to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. It was originally intended to set up a separate office, but due to limited funding, it has now been decided to be under the First Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, forming a Grain Section. Its organization will be larger than other sections, and it is currently requesting instructions from the Municipal Government. After Mayor Wu approves it, it can be established. The main tasks in the future will be to crack down on manipulation and suppress rice prices.</p>
<p>According to Deputy Director Li Jianhua of the Social Affairs Bureau, in the future, when rice merchants purchase rice, they must first register with the Grain Section and buy rice with a purchase order. They must also register the quantity purchased and the stored rice in detail with the Grain Section and sell it at the price stipulated by the authorities. It is expected that after the implementation of these rules, rice prices will tend to stabilize.</p>

<p>Shao Shuhua, deputy manager and deputy director of the Business Bureau of the Shanghai Branch of the "Central Reserve Bank," was prosecuted by the prosecutor for disturbing financial order by colluding with the enemy.

During the Anti-Japanese War, he endured four years in Shanghai, and later, due to livelihood reasons, he took up a puppet position in the thirtieth year of the Republic.

<h3 id="e67">Huang Bodu Fraud Case: Witnesses Still Awaiting Summoning <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xie of the Eighth Tribunal of the District Court interrogated fraud suspects Huang Bodu, Zhao Atu, Jiang Yiping, and Dong Guibao. Witnesses Li Jiaqing, Liu Shaojun, and Wang Wangshi, the mother of Wang Beiying, arrived. According to Huang Jidu, he claimed to be the nephew of Mayor Qian and the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs, but this was just acting on the spur of the moment, just "bragging." As for defrauding Wang Beiying of 800,000 legal currency, he flatly denied it. When asked about Zhao Atu and Jiang Yiping, they also denied it, but said that they had falsely claimed to be Huang's bodyguards. Huang Baobao, looked like a country woman. According to Huang Bodu, they were married, , Huang Bodu's behavior has always been unrestrained. He said he made a living by doing odd jobs. As for when Qian Huang Bodu gave it to her, she said it was bought. Subsequently, the witness Wang Wangshi was inquired, and it was claimed that Huang had falsely portrayed himself as a wealthy young man, defrauded her of 800,000 national currency, and defrauded her daughter's watch. As for the other two witnesses, Li Jiaqing and Liu Shaojun, they said that all the suits and 200,000 legal currency that had not been recovered were borrowed from them by Huang Bodu, and were not fraudulent. Judge Xie ruled that the case still required summoning witnesses Wu Yinzhou, Wang Beiying (i.e., Chen Lili), and Wang Xianming, and ordered a retrial at a later date. Huang Bodu was remanded in custody, and the others were released on their original bail.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] On March 27th of this year, Xu Peihuang, the son of Xu Shihui, was sentenced to four months in prison and two years probation by the District Court for causing the death of an elderly man named Shen in a bicycle accident. The Xu family was dissatisfied, claiming that two soldiers at the scene witnessed the person hitting the car, not the car hitting the person, and posted advertisements to invite the two soldiers to be witnesses for the appeal. Chen Xi saw this and, not knowing that Xu Peihuang was out on bail, thought he was detained in prison, so he forged Peihuang's letter, saying that he needed 40,000 for medicine in prison, and then asked for 20,000 for the carrier's fee, and impersonated guard number 107 of the District Court Detention Center, to "run the message" to Xu's home on the afternoon of the 23rd of last month. He was exposed by Xu's father and arrested by the police and sent to the court for processing. The case has been publicly prosecuted by prosecutor Quan Tao, so Chen Xi not only did not "run" to get the "message," but instead ran into prison.</p>

<p>Reporting Changshan's Anti-Malarial Effects Surpass Quinine</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Central Committee member Chen Guofu, in view of the scarcity of Western medicine sources during the Anti-Japanese War and the urgent need for self-sufficiency in national medicine, strongly advocated refining and manufacturing drugs from national medicines that truly possess special efficacy. After several years of meticulous research by domestic medical experts, significant results have been achieved, including the special anti-malarial drug Changshan. Mr. Chen initiated the organization of the "Chinese Special Drug Research Institute" last year, concurrently serving as its director. During his recent visit to Shanghai, he invited over thirty medical experts and prominent individuals from the city, including Jiang Yiping, Yu Songyun, Yu Yunxiu, Wang Qizhang, Li Shengbo, Xu Xiaochu, Wang Genzhong, and Bao Guochang, to discuss related matters. Mr. Chen reported on the institute's founding principles and the process of researching and manufacturing the special anti-malarial drug Changshan, stating briefly: In the spring of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), feeling that the rear areas were blockaded by the enemy, the source of Western medicines was cut off, and malaria was prevalent in the southwest, creating an urgent need for treatment drugs, it happened that Cheng Jingfang, an employee of the Third Division of the Attendant Office, distributed copies of a published malaria treatment prescription to colleagues. Some malaria patients recovered after taking one dose. He then requested the Central Political School Medical Research Institute to conduct chemical verification, and it was discovered that Changshan was the main ingredient. After clinical trials on over a thousand people, and with three allocations of research funding from Chairman Chiang, three years of successful experiments completely proved Changshan's effectiveness as a malaria treatment drug, surpassing quinine in its efficacy. After the news spread, this Changshan drug, which had been used for over a thousand years, attracted the attention of the domestic and international medical communities. Countries such as England and the United States came to request it. Therefore, colleagues initiated the organization of the research institute to expand operations. In addition to malaria, research will also be conducted on the most prevalent and difficult-to-treat diseases in our country, such as typhoid fever, tuberculosis, rabies, leprosy, cancer, and mental illness. Furthermore, research will be conducted on the cheapest and most effective drugs to replace expensive Western medicines. Subsequently, Deputy Director Cheng Xueming reported on the institute's organization. Wang Genzhong, Yu Yunxiu, Wang Qizhang, and others spoke in succession, unanimously supporting Mr. Chen's advocacy and hoping that enthusiastic individuals in the city would provide as much financial assistance as possible to facilitate rapid development.</p>

<p>Activating Silk Merchant Funds for Selling at a Favorable Price</p>
<p>In order to facilitate raw silk export trade and promote the business operations of silk cocoon manufacturers, the China Silk Company has contacted raw silk importers and manufacturers abroad. For export raw silk that has passed inspection by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, a consignment method is adopted for shipment to New York. The company will use its name to obtain a mortgage from the National Bank, advancing 70% of the loan based on New York market prices. Manufacturers only need to bear an annual interest rate of 3%, with a term of three months. Once the silk is sold in New York, the loan will be settled. This method not only activates the circulation of manufacturers' funds but also allows raw silk to be sold at a favorable price. In May, the company facilitated the export of 900 bundles of alkaline silk in the first batch, all of which were 78, 81, and 83 "degree" silk. Recently, another 400 bundles of raw silk were loaded onto a ship bound for New York on August 20th. As for local domestic and foreign merchants in this port who order raw silk from the company for export to Europe and America, the company also handles these orders and has completed several transactions involving hundreds of bundles. Recently, there have been contacts with British and French parties, and in the future, the target export countries will be the United States, Britain, and France. If foreign merchants have existing connections with their domestic silk factories and can offer reasonable prices for transactions with the company, the company is also happy to cooperate, ensuring that the quantity of raw silk exported is absolutely free.</p>

<p>(Our Newspaper's Report) Since convening its inaugural meeting and establishing four sub-committee meetings, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee has been holding frequent and lengthy meetings. However, due to the strict confidentiality maintained by the committee members, the details of the various meetings have remained unknown. Among these, the regulations concerning future brokers are of particular interest to various sectors. According to inquiries made by our newspaper reporter: the rule that "broker licenses cannot be transferred" represents a groundbreaking change compared to previous regulations. In addition, conditions such as the broker's age, education, conduct, creditworthiness, experience, and assets are all being carefully considered. Commercial ethics will be particularly emphasized for future brokers, and therefore, conduct and creditworthiness will be given special attention among the various conditions. It is also reported that the Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee is drafting all regulations with a focus on safeguarding the welfare of the public, adhering to the principles of democracy and socialization, and not adhering to traditional forms, but rather following the trends of the times as a guideline.</p>

<p>In order to understand the nature of the "company" organizations that trade in top-houses (houses with transferable leases) in the city, the reporter made a roadside visit. According to investigations, these types of "companies" are mostly concentrated on Avenue Joffre (霞飛路), Rue Cardinal Mercier (環龍路) and Chongqing Road. The ×Da Company at number ×××, Rue Cardinal Mercier is one of the best, its facilities being more complete than those of other companies.</p>
<p>The ×Da "company" is established in an old French-style municipal building along the road, more like a shop than a company. The entire organization does not comply with the company law. It's business is centered only on the taking of brokerage from those trading in these leases.</p>
<p>According to manager Mr. Shen, this "company" has been established for several months. Based on average transactions of past months, about twenty top-houses are traded each month. Its profit is therefore quite considerable.</p>
<p>Most of the houses it owns (that is, those available for transfer) are registered with it through the direct or indirect introduction of friends, with the information entered into a register, such as the location, number of rooms, telephone, sanitation facilities, gas, lease prices etc. If the information is indirect, when the top-house is traded, the middleman on average receives a commission from the "company."</p>
<p>When a customer (top-house buyer) comes to inquire about a house, the manager refers to the register, explaining the details and asking the customer to fill out a letter of commission: the letter states that the "company" will find a house on his or her behalf, and upon completion of the deal, the "company" will take 1/10 as a brokerage, which cannot be delayed, and will pay a commission fee of 2,000 legal currency, this is a regular monthly income item. Imagine if about twenty people go to commission it daily, the company will make 40,000 legal currency in commission fees, that is, this one item of commission fees, each month it will be over millions of legal currency. The "company" has no fixed capital, only one phone, one desk, and several chairs. The "company" does not hire staff, but is made up of several partners who also act as managers, brokers, etc. It is claimed that this "company" was originally a Western doctor's clinic, but the business was so dull that it could not maintain itself, so it switched to this business. Fortunately, the organization is simple, and when business is poor, it can be closed down at any time.</p>
<p>Since the reporter made an inquiry as a customer, he was allowed to look at its registration book at random. The top fees range from five to thirty "bars", which shows the ruthlessness of those who own houses and the heavy exploitation of the lease-trading brokers. (Zhaoyue)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Extremely Worthy of Attention: Fish That Slipped Through the Net: The Deportation of Japanese Overseas Chinese and Prisoners of War: Inadequate Investigation: Many Key War Criminals Not Arrested <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The deportation of Japanese overseas Chinese from the city is nearing completion. According to Mr. Liu Shifang, the president of the military tribunal of the First Pacification Area Command, who previously told reporters, the number of Japanese war criminals who have been transferred is not very large, and many lack supporting evidence. Therefore, most Japanese people will safely return to their country and spend their remaining years in peace. However, according to a senior official of a certain Chinese military agency who is extremely familiar with the situation in Japan, who told reporters: the preliminary investigation for this deportation of Japanese overseas Chinese and prisoners of war was not thorough, and many of the main perpetrators of the invasion of China are likely to become fish that slipped through the net. For example, Iwai Eiichi and Fukuma, senior officials of the Japanese Embassy who were previously responsible for cultural work in the Jiangnan area, have not been arrested. In addition, in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, everyone knows about the "Tobe Unit", which specializes in collecting materials and issuing passports for the enemy. The person in charge of this "Tobe Unit" is Kaneko, the head of the "Kaneko Agency" who was responsible for special operations in Suzhou. It is now heard that he is also at large. In addition, there is also the well-known member of the Black Dragon Society, Colonel Iwata, Yamaie (山家), who was responsible for intelligence in North China, and Er Wang, who was responsible for special operations in Shanghai in the later stages of the Anti-Japanese War, and there has been no news of their arrest. As for the puppet police bureau, the French traitor Shariku has been executed, but Goshima Shigeru, who was in charge of "Special Higher Police" at the time, has not been punished. If he is not subjected to legal sanctions, it is truly disappointing.</p>

<h3 id="e86">National Universities to Conditionally Allow the Establishment of Preparatory Classes Starting in 1946: Avoiding the Retaking of High School Courses in the Lower Years of University <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Special Telegram from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] University preparatory classes were originally one of the wartime facilities. In 1938, after Wuhan fell to the enemy, many secondary school graduates fled to Sichuan. In that year, the Ministry of Education piloted a unified enrollment system. Those who were not admitted had nowhere to go. To help these young people, a special university preparatory class was established in Baisha to accommodate them. Later, there were young people of this type in various places, so each university was allowed to establish preparatory classes. After one year of study, the top 50% in terms of grades were allowed to be promoted without examination, which was very convenient for high school graduates. Later, two independent preparatory classes were added in Xiuning, Anhui, and Ganxian, Jiangxi, to accommodate out-of-school youths in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hunan, Jiangxi areas. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the Ministry of Education expects that there will still be people who want to go to university whose education are not at the level of acceptance, and at the same time, in order to improve the level of universities and avoid the need to retake high school courses in the lower years of university, it has been decided that starting this year, national universities and independent colleges will be allowed to establish preparatory classes. The independent preparatory classes that were originally specially established will all be closed at the end of this summer vacation. In accordance with the method of establishing preparatory classes affiliated to national universities and independent colleges, preparatory class students will be self-funded in principle, and the subjects studied will be limited to remedial high school courses. After one year of study, after strict examinations, those who pass all subjects will be allowed to enter the first grade of the relevant colleges and universities without examination to study.</p>
<h3 id="e87">National Universities and Independent Colleges Affiliated Preparatory Class Methods Total Eleven <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The "National University and Independent College Affiliated Preparatory Class Method" recently announced by the Ministry of Education is recorded below: (1) In order to improve the level of universities and avoid the need to retake high school courses in the lower grades of universities, the Ministry of Education has decided to allow national universities and independent colleges to establish preparatory classes starting from 1946. Those who originally had preparatory classes should be closed at the end of the 1945 academic year. (2) The preparatory class will have one director, who will comprehensively manage the class affairs, and will be concurrently appointed by the president of the university or the president of the college from among the professors of the university or college. If necessary, one or two employees may be appointed. (3) The preparatory class's academic, general affairs, and guidance matters will be handled uniformly by the university or college, and the teachers of each class will also be concurrently appointed by the teachers of the university or college in principle. (4) The number of classes to be established in the preparatory class will be reported to the Ministry for approval by the university or college. (5) Each class in the preparatory class will have 50 students. (6) The universities and colleges that establish preparatory classes will uniformly raise the admission examination standards starting from 1947 (for example, if the admission standard in 1946 was 50 points, it should be increased to 60 points in the 1947 academic year, and so on). Students who could be admitted according to last year's standards but cannot be admitted according to this year's standards may be admitted depending on the approved class capacity. (7) The subjects studied in the preparatory class will be limited to remedial high school courses, and the syllabus will be determined separately. (8) Students in the preparatory class will be self-funded in principle. (9) The study period for the preparatory class is limited to one year. After the period expires, a transcript may be given. (10) After the preparatory class study period expires, those who pass all subjects after a strict examination may enter the first grade of the university or college without examination to study. (11) This method will be implemented from the date of its promulgation. (Fool)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu] The case of Zhang Guogong (also known as Zhu Yuquan), a student at Chengdu Lida Middle School, who wounded the Director of Discipline, Zhu Peisheng, was sentenced by the Criminal Court of the District Court on the 29th of last month, with President Xu personally serving as the judge. When the criminal was brought to the court, he was disheveled and looked utterly distraught. After the judge inquired about his name, age, place of origin, and residence, he immediately read out the verdict. The gist was that Zhang Guogong, a student at Lida School, used a knife to attempt to kill someone, which was confirmed by the school and students present at the scene. He was found guilty of "attempted murder" and sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. The compensation portion will be handled by the Immigration Court. As soon as the verdict was announced, the criminal Zhang glared and said loudly to the judge, "You are right, you might as well sentence me to death. I will definitely not appeal..." The judge then told him that if he believed the verdict was inappropriate, he could appeal to the High Court within ten days after the verdict, and there was no need to argue here. He immediately announced the adjournment. Zhang Guogong was then returned to prison. (Quan)</p>

<h3 id="e100">Elementary School Curriculum Research (10): Strengthening the Nation with Science: Natural Science Teaching Time Should be Increased, Strengthening the Race Requires Hygiene: Hygiene Teaching Subject Should be Restored <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>In the age of science, in the world of science, after the end of World War II, atomic bombs, radar, rockets... people and farmers are still constantly researching and inventing, preparing for the Third World War. China, which was sick but fortunately rose to become one of the four great powers, how should we promote science and develop science with the belief that nation-building will surely succeed, given our historically backward scientific development? In the elementary school curriculum, which is related to the foundation of national construction, the content of natural science should of course be enriched! The teaching time for natural science should also be increased!</p>
<p>The hygiene subject, in the present era of promoting health education, was once independent. The revisers of the standards were afraid that there were too many subjects, so they separated the hygiene teaching materials and incorporated them into social studies and group training, deliberately dividing systematic and complete knowledge into fragmented pieces, as if this was in line with psychology, and it was a crime to adopt scientific compilation and conduct systematic research. In fact, if it is believed that children's mental abilities are limited, and the elementary school curriculum should not be too heavy, then hygiene knowledge is not necessary; hygiene habits should not be cultivated; then it is not necessary to separate many hygiene materials and incorporate them into other subjects, which would only increase the burden on other subjects. If it is said that the "Sick Man of East Asia" has not yet recovered, and national health must continue to receive special attention. For the sake of reasonable research and strengthening learning effectiveness, there is a great need to restore the elementary school hygiene subject! (Qian Dasan, 35, 6, 13, in Zhenjiang)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the panic over government bonds subsided. Surface gangs became active again, and buying interest gradually increased. The Unified C Bonds opened flat in the morning, but after the opening, there was another wave of excitement, which boosted buying interest. Midway, the price rebounded to around 150 yuan, but before closing, it fell back to below 2950 yuan. As a result, it closed 300 yuan higher than the previous close. A and B Bonds also rose 300 yuan, D Bonds rose 200 yuan, and E Bonds rose 400 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Yu Huancheng, Chairman of the Securities Dealers Association, the occurrence of this incident was purely due to speculation. He had repeatedly warned all colleagues to be cautious in their transactions to avoid future troubles. However, Shanghai is a mixed place, and during the enemy-puppet period, speculative habits were formed. After the victory, this trend was difficult to overcome for a while. The price of the Unified C Bonds, for some unknown reason, was raised to such a high level. Recently, the news of redemption and interest payment came, and the market price plummeted, leading to the tragic fate of more than a dozen securities firms going bankrupt. This was truly a case of reaping what one sows. According to financial authorities, the recent sharp drop in bond prices is a normal phenomenon. Because the face value of the bonds is based on legal tender, and today the universal currency system is still legal tender, the standard has not changed. In the future, the government's redemption and interest payment for these bonds will still be calculated in legal tender. For example, the Unified C Bonds once rose to a peak of 8,200 yuan for every 100 yuan face value, compared to a pre-war market price of only about 60 yuan. The reason for such a strong rising trend now is due to the flow of speculative funds to this area.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Gold Market Calm <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was even more stable. It opened flat in the morning, and after the opening, it fell from 1.895 million to 1.88 million. Excessive floating had been cleared up, and after that, it gradually became peaceful, hovering around the opening price. The central government allocated 225 bars at a price of 1.895 million. After 10 o'clock, it briefly rose slightly to over 1.9 million. At noon, it struggled at 1.895 million. In the afternoon, it rebounded slightly. As a result, it closed 10,000 higher than the previous close. US dollars and Hong Kong dollars were both popular, leading to this situation. Gold ornaments and silver ingots were both flat. Secret lending rates were flat. Those with funds still dared not release them easily. Many people bought gold notes, and interest rates ranged from 12% to 15%.</p>
<h3 id="e114">US Dollars and Hong Kong Notes are Both Popular <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Foreign exchange US dollars opened at around 2,600 yuan in the morning. Although it fell slightly to 2,590 yuan after the opening, foreign firms soon bought in, and it gradually recovered to around 2,630 yuan. In the afternoon, it struggled around 2,620 yuan. As a result, it closed 20 yuan higher than the previous close. Hong Kong notes rose 20 yuan due to news that the US Senate Banking Committee had urged the House of Representatives to pass the British and American loans in advance, and that bill brokers were buying in. The Hong Kong exchange rate was over 480 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 590 yuan, and the US exchange rate was stagnant.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Guangzhou Opens Foreign Exchange; Measures are the Same as in Shanghai <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Guangzhou, 18th] The Bank of China announced today that nine banks in Guangzhou have formed an association to jointly manage foreign exchange, with measures similar to those in Shanghai. The participating banks include the Bank of China, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Farmers Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Central Trust Bureau, Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau, Guangdong Bank, Banque de l'Indochine, and China National Products Bank. However, there is no large-scale foreign trade here yet, because the business of British and American firms, except for oil and steamship companies, is currently very quiet. It is said that foreign trade in South China has not developed normally due to restrictions from the Chinese Company Law and Customs Regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Tea Market Lacks Activity; Gongxi Factory Produces Tea for Domestic Sales <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The depressed tea market for foreign merchants has seen industry colleagues try hard to develop, but ultimately failed due to high costs, resulting in continued dullness. Recently, the Wuchang and Xinhua tea companies in this city, as well as the British firm Jardine Matheson, are planning to ship more than 3,000 boxes of black and green tea for export. As for domestic sales of fancy teas, although the shops and dealers in this street and the Suzhou area are demanding them, the holders are solely focused on hoarding and raising prices. With an uneven supply and demand, the market lacks activity. Gongxi green tea, which specializes in sales to Mumbai, India, has seen its appeal revive because the street recognized that low-quality goods were not welcomed there, but the market prices were very suitable, leading to a gradual resumption of demand. Currently, deals have been made, and there are plans to modify production for domestic sales.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Liquidation of Banks and Firms; Formal Conclusion to be Ordered <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Banks and money firms opened during the enemy-puppet period have been ordered by the Ministry to be liquidated within a time limit. Now that the time limit has expired, quite a few have already completed liquidation, but most have not yet closed down or formally announced their closure. It is said that some are still waiting and hoping to resume business, while others are still secretly engaging in discounting and lending activities. The authorities have already taken note of this and are said to be issuing strict orders to expedite the closure and formally announce it, reporting to the Ministry for record.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Yarn Market Calm; Spot Cotton Transactions Become Smoother <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was increasingly stable. Large-scale 20-count yarn from the South China group was frequently absorbed, and the price continued to rise by 120,000 yuan. Shuangma yarn took the lead and once broke through the 1.4 million mark. Medium and small-sized 20-count yarn and double-strand yarn prices were not affected. 32-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose slightly by 10,000. Sentiment was calm because the street's door sales and weaving factories both lacked demand. At noon, the spinning and weaving factory opened for yarn sales as usual. Sunlight offered 20-count yarn at a price that was 10,000 lower than the previous period. The prices of other counts of yarn also fell by 10,000 to 40,000. Today, the silver and money industry will hold its semi-annual closing holiday, and the yarn industry will also close for one day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton telegraphic news fell 16 to 24 points. Near-term American gold was 29.200, long-term 29.30, and Mittling spot was 29.99. The local spot cotton market was stable, but transactions became smoother. Xin Yuren, Desu, Lun, and Qingfeng factories all made purchases. Flower numbers were also traded, and the market was not deserted.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Taiwan Company Unwilling to Supply; Sugar Prices Decline and Then Rebound <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Rumored that 60,000 bags will arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was initially very flat because the Taiwan Sugar Company intended to continue selling. However, when company employees went to the association to observe, the market atmosphere was very strong, and they backed off. The market began to question the company's mission to suppress prices and examined the facts. The company had only sold middle-grade sugar four times in total. When sales opened, each firm applied for a purchase quota based on the amount they could consume, which determined the market trend. The company would delay until 3 or 4 pm to decide on the quota and price. The fourth application reached 70,000 bags, but only 9,500 bags were supplied. The price was "determined by them," and buyers initially had no objections. However, the company still felt it was insufficient. The day before yesterday, they changed to a method of selling high. Yesterday, the market went even further, and they would not supply even at high prices. This created a situation where sugar prices declined and then rebounded. The association's marked price for middle-grade sugar in the morning was initially 91,500 yuan and 2,000 yuan. When news of the company stopping sales came, it quickly rose to 98,500 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was the original price, but it soon reached 99,000 yuan, and it closed at 98,000 yuan, up 6,000 to 7,000 yuan from the previous day. Numbered goods followed closely. Kai Quanzhou Yang was 40 bags, 91,000 yuan, Xinghua white 103,000 yuan to 98,000 yuan, more than 200 baskets, Xing Chi 94,500 yuan, Diao Qing hundreds of bags, 74,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan, Huanggang Qing 80 bags, 77,000 yuan.</p>
<p>According to Song Yixin, manager of the Taiwan Sugar Company, the company has shipped 5,500 tons of sugar, about 60,000 bags, from Taiwan. Two ships, one from China Merchants and one from Moller, are expected to arrive in Shanghai before the end of the month. A branch company is also being prepared in North China because shipping Taiwan sugar from Keelung, unloading it in Shanghai, and then transporting it to North China would require two freight and storage fees, which would invisibly increase the price of sugar. It has now been confirmed that the cost of shipping Taiwan sugar directly to North China is the same as shipping it to Shanghai. Therefore, the company has decided to establish a North China distribution office in the shortest possible time. With an ample supply of sugar in other ports, the price of sugar in Shanghai will also be automatically suppressed.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Rainproof Cloth Sells Well; Inland Searches are Quite Intense <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Rainproof cloth sales have recently exceeded any previous period because in the past it was only used by the public to make raincoats, but this summer it is needed for American-style clothing by various sectors of the air and land forces. In particular, Nanjing gangs are widely selling it. They have successively shipped seven or eight thousand yards. It is said that Xuzhou, Anqing, Xi'an, and other ports also need it, and they are searching for it in Beijing, which has further increased its sales. Scarcity makes it expensive. With large actual sales and activity, the market supply cannot meet the demand, and prices are rising steadily. Each yard has risen from 4,000 yuan to 7,250 yuan. Most are still lacking spot goods. It is necessary to place an order with raincoat cloth manufacturers ten days in advance and pay 70% deposit in advance. Generally, rainproof cloth manufacturers are earning three times their profit and are rushing to dye and sell inferior cloth. The colors fade, and there are many jump wires and blocks, but operators only seek to profit, adhering to the principle of producing more and faster, regardless of quality, cutting corners, and reducing materials. Recently, sales have been slightly affected, and prices have fallen to about 6,000 yuan per yard.</p>

<p>The Central Bank authorities, noting that deposits in various silver and money firms in the city are decreasing month by month, intend to readjust deposit interest rates and have instructed the Financial Institutions Inspection Office to be responsible for researching standard interest rates, which will be implemented in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>The city's rice market has decided to divide into two areas, north and south, and will begin implementing this next month. The Jiangnan Electric Power Bureau, established by the Resources Committee, is now striving to carry out a large-scale power generation plan. It is reported that if the plan is completed, not only will the entire electricity supply of Shanghai be sufficient, but also the electricity supply of all cities and counties in the Jiangnan region will be abundant.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 18th: Star Island has a severe shortage of cloth. In the past month, more than 1,000 pieces have been shipped from the city to meet the market demand, including printed cloth, black cloth, and poplin, with printed cloth being the most common. Therefore, the price of printed cloth in the city has risen.</p>

<p>Some large Chinese stock traders continue cross-trading. Retail investors' psychology is slightly stable. Industry insiders are also adding maintenance. Stocks that had fallen too much rebounded more strongly yesterday. At its peak, Yongsha had a high price of 615 yuan, Mei Ya 4080 yuan, Jingfu 265 yuan, Xinguang 255 yuan, and Qinxing 200 yuan. The afternoon closed slightly lower. As a result, Yongsha and Mei Ya fell slightly, while the three small stocks rose by more than half a percent. Medium and small unpopular stocks were stable. Old stocks remained weak. The foreign stock situation was stable. Except for Jardine Matheson, the remaining stocks had a few buyers and showed some activity. Ewo Silk once rose to around 10,600 yuan and then turned flat. As a result, Jardine Matheson fell slightly. Ewo Brewery, Paper, and Yeguang were flat. Ewo Silk, British Alliance Steel, and Asia continued to advance slightly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to people who have studied finance, some factory stocks are now increasing their par value due to increased capital, but many factories have machines and production equipment that have exceeded their applicable years and are old and unusable. Industrial production will soon become a major problem. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to whether the increase in value is appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Market Trading is Thin; Rice Prices Remain Stable <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the rice number front store rice distribution method, people's minds have been settled. Market trading among colleagues is thin. Yesterday, the prices of various grades of goods remained unchanged. The market trend showed no change. Only 2,597 piculs of passenger goods were registered, a decrease of 1,411 piculs from the previous market. Flour prices are weak, continuing to fall by 500 to 600 yuan. Wheat bran fell slightly by 400 to 500 yuan again. Broad beans arriving in large quantities are being digested normally, falling slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, with few transactions. Soybeans are stable, but raw peanuts are outstanding. Shantou prices were firm early and weak in the afternoon. New wheat is coming onto the market, and the source is gradually increasing, but the trend remains flat. Soybean cake digestion is weak, rural sales are sluggish, and prices are falling by 500 to 600 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Rayon Supply and Demand Imbalanced; Factory Prices Stable, Silk Goods Weak <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, 120-count bright rayon from Tianqiao opened at 1.6 million yuan in the morning. With imbalanced supply and demand, it was again rising and popular. The highest price was 65 yuan, and it then fell back to 620,000 yuan at the close. The afternoon price was 640,000 yuan, up 70,000 yuan from the previous day. The price once reached 680,000 yuan in the afternoon, but there were no buyers, and it became a pipe dream. Miscellaneous brands were all 30,000 to 40,000 yuan higher. 75-count Jingji semi-gloss had a declining sales style, but was still expensive due to scarcity. The price was similar to 120-count bright rayon from Tianqiao. Yesterday, holders sought to sell, so the asking price failed to keep up. Amid a consistent rise, it brought a high of 10,000 yuan. Factory prices were stable. The market was quiet. Few transactions took place. Selling prices generally did not change much. The scenery of silk goods has faded. Mei Ya quilts had no transactions all day yesterday. Taicheng checks and crepe were 5,250 yuan in the morning and 320 yuan in the afternoon. Sheng Hang goods were also slightly weak.</p>

<p>The cloth market was plain and unremarkable. Due to sluggish passenger sales, everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude. The market transaction is very leisurely, so the prices have fallen by 250 yuan to 500 yuan. However, the stock is not thick, so the market is still stable. The China Textile Company has not yet resolved the matter of exchanging American and Mexican cloth.</p>

Hongji Jiaozuo lump coal and small lump coal, although the stock is thinner and has special uses, the owners are still trying to hold it up, but ultimately they cannot take care of the overall situation and have also seen a small cut. Bituminous coal trends slightly, and the foundation is also weak. Although the market for coal balls and firewood is stable, sales of all goods are sluggish.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Famine in Guangxi, Dancing in Liuzhou <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Airmail from Liuzhou, Reporting for This Newspaper on the 3rd</p>
<p>According to reports from Guangzhou newspapers regarding Liuzhou, the entire province of Guangxi is filled with famine victims. They are willing to give their own children to those who have the means to raise them, to prevent them from starving to death. Families with teenage daughters are searching for potential husbands for them. Only the wealthy can afford two meals of porridge a day, while famine victims can only gnaw on tree bark and grass roots. The price of rice in Guangxi has recently risen to 70,000 yuan per *dan* (a unit of dry measure, approximately 100 liters). Guangxi is originally a rice-producing area, so this price is considered extremely high. The cause of the famine in Guangxi is due to two directly opposite reasons: first, a prolonged drought without rain, and then, too much rain. In Liuzhou and Wuzhou, famine victims can be seen lying on the roadside. Other passersby are dispirited, and no one pays attention to the dying famine victims, because such scenes have become commonplace.</p>
<p>The above situation appeared in a Guangzhou dispatch from the United Press on the 18th. Now, we have received an airmail report from our special correspondent, reporting the latest details of Liuzhou, which serves as confirmation and is especially moving. (Editor)</p>
<p>In the vast night, the car, accompanied by a gust of wind and drizzle, once again brings me into this heart of Guangxi.</p>
<p>Beneath the peaks of Mount Liyu (Carp Fish Peak), gauze-like mist and clouds swirl. Pale yellow lights illuminate the broken roads, the mud and water on the roads, and the densely packed thatched huts along the roadside. Everything seems so bleak and gloomy. The ruthless artillery fire has shattered this heart into pieces.</p>
<p>New Buildings and Broken Tiles – Forming a Stark Contrast</p>
<p>Turning past Mount Liyu and entering the city center, it feels like stepping into another world. Stately, newly constructed buildings stand proudly erect in the rubble. Transportation companies, real estate companies, banks... Looking across, and even further, brand-new buildings interspersed with dilapidated walls form a stark contrast. "The recovery is coming soon," I think to myself. Liuzhou was one way two years ago, another way a year ago, and now Liuzhou is rapidly changing towards a new life. The vicissitudes of life, the ever-changing world, thinking about it truly fills one with countless emotions.</p>
<p>A screen of verdant stone mountains surrounds Liuzhou tightly, like a large cake. A rushing, turbulent Liu River crosses this heart, flowing to the endless distance, dividing the city into north and south sides. Today, the bustling and lively scene in Henan (south of the river) is ten times more prosperous than it used to be, while Hebei (north of the river) remains desolate, desolate, and pitiful. In the past, Peixin Road, a financial street no more than 500 meters long with seventeen banks, now, except for a dozen or so newly built businesses and hotels, is desolate and deserted. At night, the lights are dim and pedestrians are few. When the music from the hotels occasionally drifts through the rubble, one truly doesn't know whether it is sour or sweet.</p>
<p>Slogans High Above Restaurants – Dancing and Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The essence of the entire city is concentrated in a corner of Henan. Here, I can say that if it weren't for the four industries of hotels, restaurants, gold shops, and transportation companies, Liuzhou would simply not be a city and could hardly be said to have recovered its prosperity. In other words: hotels, restaurants, gold shops, and transportation companies have revived Liuzhou's "prosperity." On my first night walking on the streets of Henan, I counted the relatively decent hotels, and before I even reached half, I had already counted to forty-two. Exhaustion made it impossible for me to continue counting. Otherwise, this would have been a rather interesting statistic. Moreover, all the restaurants are competing with each other in ingenuity, each striving to be different, with strange and wonderful "preferential" methods that are too numerous to describe. On the top floor of the hotels, there is the sound of "booming and thumping." Guangxi is starving, but Liuzhou is dancing? What is laughable is that at the entrance of every restaurant's staircase, there is a disaster relief donation box, forlornly shrinking in the corner, and the people going in and out don't even glance at it. Slogans like "A single meal costs thousands of gold, where does the money come from?" are plastered on the walls of the staircase. The people who don't know where the money comes from are still desperately dispersing banknotes. Slogans are too commonplace for them.</p>
<p>Hotels Like Bamboo Shoots After Spring Rain – Scattered Throughout the Streets and Alleys</p>
<p>Hotels are like tender bamboo shoots after a spring rain, scattered throughout the streets and alleys, but finding a room is not easy. On the night of the reporter's arrival, despite the rain, I ran through eight hotels in a row before finally finding a room that a traveler had just moved out of. The overnight fee was 2,500 yuan. This price would naturally not be surprising in Shanghai, where gold bars are used for transactions, but in Guangxi, it is truly rare and expensive. As I write this, I look out the window, and the streets below are bustling with countless travelers rushing for fame and fortune, hurrying back and forth. One after another, they leave a hotel and run into another!</p>
<p>What is strange is that the signboards of every business here are written by one or two people. At first, I thought that the calligraphers were probably some kind of masters, but later I saw that the writing was not very skillful. After some time, I realized that they were either written by commissioners or county magistrates. Even a small tire repair shop had a sign that read "Inscribed by Xiao Jinghua" (Magistrate of Liujiang County). The merchants' thirst for fame is evident here, and pitifully naive.</p>
<p>Liuzhou's liveliness is considered second to none in Guangxi, and prices are probably not willing to fall behind. After a rain, the price of rice has stabilized a lot, but here it is still about 40,000 yuan per *dan*. A meal costs at least 1,500 yuan per person. Calculating it, a traveler has to spend at least 6,000 yuan a day. In a second-hand stall on the street, there is a suit of unknown material. Asking the price, it is 300,000 yuan. Amitabha! My salary for three months is not enough to buy a suit! The war has changed everything, but only prices are like the river water of the Liu River, overflowing day by day, rising foot by foot. When the autumn wind rises and the spring floods are over, I don't know what it will become like.</p>
<p>Director Out on Inspection – Staff Chatting and Laughing Pleasantly</p>
<p>The Guangxi branch of the Relief Administration is located behind Mount Liyu in Liuzhou. The buildings are secluded and elegant, with painted beams and flying eaves, truly a paradise on earth. The reporter also ran to the front of the door to admire it. Director Huang had gone out on inspection, and only a few staff members in sharp suits were standing at the door chatting and laughing with their girlfriends. Not wanting to disturb them, I retreated circumspectly. Turning around, I headed towards the refugee camp.</p>
<p>The relief branch is located in Liuzhou, so logically speaking, the refugees in Liuzhou should naturally be the first to benefit, but in the reporter's personal opinion, this "benefit" is not very bright. However, in good conscience, it is indeed better than nothing.</p>
<p>The refugee camp is at the foot of Ma'anshan (Saddle Mountain), no more than 200 steps from the relief branch. Compared to the deep courtyard of the branch, it is far inferior. Four or five hundred people are crammed under some American-made tents. Occasionally, there are one or two mud houses, with a room less than two *zhang* (approximately 6.6 meters) square crammed with forty-six people, plus some broken and ragged furniture of the refugees, truly a pigsty. Some are lowering their heads mending clothes that can no longer be mended, some are catching fleas. Men, women, old and young are packed into one room. The sounds of Hunanese, Cantonese, and chattering are mixed, containing an unknown amount of tears!</p>
<p>Children Beg for Money – Kneeling Down with a Thud</p>
<p>Being able to be accommodated is considered very fortunate. How can one count the emaciated disaster victims wandering the streets every night? In a great famine, thousands upon thousands of disaster victims run to the city with a hope, but in the end, one life after another disappears in the noisy market, carrying disappointment and throwing themselves into the embrace of death. This is a portrayal of the disaster victims. On rainy and windy nights, three or five silently sleep under dilapidated walls, pressing their empty stomachs, listening to the melodious music above the restaurants. I truly don't know what their feelings are at this time? Alas!</p>
<p>Walking past Xiaonan Road, a child holding an iron can chased after me asking for money. I dropped a few hundred yuan into it. The child looked at the banknotes, and without a sound, "thumped" to the ground and kowtowed to me, startling me greatly. I quickly pulled him up and asked where his parents were. He pointed to the corner of the wall on the right and ran back. Although a few hundred yuan is probably no less shameful than twelve *liang* (approximately 750 grams) of relief flour, I am ashamed for myself and for many heartless people.</p>
<p>The "moon" that truly enjoys the moonlight near the water will not be the refugees. On the contrary, the restaurants have scooped up a large batch of American relief flour, making truly worthy "exquisite refreshments." The tycoons are wearing suits and khaki pants made from relief supplies. One day, I was drinking tea in a tea house and saw snow-white buns, which I had not seen for eight years. I couldn't help but ask the waitress, "Are these buns made with relief flour?" The waitress thought for a moment, and then gave me a sweet smile, swayed her waist, and gracefully left.</p>
<p>Also, recently the relief branch hired a large number of commercial vehicles to transport relief supplies to various places. Because the people in the branch are too generous in handling things, they fill the cars with relief supplies without checking them, and then let the cars drive away. As a result, the drivers of the commercial vehicles take great advantage of this. When they arrive at their destination, some of the relief supplies are missing by half, and some of the cars are even gone. Bizarre and confused, both are possible. Please tell me, should these things be laughed at or cried at?</p>
<p>Cultural Undertakings in Decline – No Resurgence of Vigorous Atmosphere</p>
<p>Cultural undertakings are out of the question here. The vigorous atmosphere of the past is now the scene of "old palace maids talking about Emperor Xuanzong." Speaking of newspapers, there are three daily newspapers: the Liuzhou edition of the Guangxi Daily, which is government-run. I don't know how to criticize it. Writing this, I suddenly remembered reading a few sentences in that newspaper, "Taking the Kuomintang's money to run a newspaper, harboring Communist Party words, what a joke, what a joke." I don't want to say that the Guangxi Daily is such a newspaper, but how should it be said? That is for the intelligent readers to think about. In addition, there are the Great Era News and the Yan News. The former is pro-Communist, and the latter is not necessarily pro-Communist. The three newspapers stand in front of the readers in an environment of struggle and losses. In addition, there is one evening newspaper and one three-day publication, both with pitifully small sales. There are very few bookstores. The Commercial Press has a branch here. Most of the other bookstores are doing a half-open business with little breath left. Shanghai-style publications are airlifted from Shanghai and sell extremely well. A publication priced at 300 yuan can sell for 600 yuan. Shanghai newspapers can sometimes be seen here a day late. Schools include the provincial Liuzhou Middle School, Liuzhuang Normal School, Liujiang County Middle School, and the private Zhongzheng and Longcheng Middle Schools. Guangxi University used to be located in Zhugejiang (Partridge River) not far from here, but it has now moved to Guilin.</p>
<p>Adding an Air Route from Liuzhou to Guangzhou</p>
<p>Speaking of transportation, this heart, since its two blood vessels—the Xiang-Gui and Qian-Gui Railways—were severed, is much more paralyzed than before. The magnificent north-south train stations of the past have now become a scene of ruins. The setting sun and withered grass are dilapidated and without light. Although the Xiang-Qian Railway has been repeatedly said to be restored by a certain date, the locomotives, sleepers, and tracks are all problems. How easy is it to talk about?</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that the Liuzhou to Laibin section may be open to traffic by the end of the month, but looking at it now, I'm afraid it will be another "five-day capital official," pleasing to the people. I hope the government will find a way and spend money soon. When the people of Liuzhou once again see the fire dragon spitting thick black smoke and galloping across this basin, it will also restore the spirit of the country.</p>
<p>The highways here reach Guilin and Changsha to the north, Yulin and Zhanjiang to the south, Yiyi and Guiyang to the right, and another road to Yongning, exiting to Vietnam, which is quite convenient. The Highway Bureau regularly has buses running between Yongliu and Guilieu, which is comfortable and cheap, but the road surface is a bit bad. You also have to constantly worry about the green forest heroes (bandits). China National Aviation Corporation has a flight to Chongqing every Thursday, and recently has added an air route from Liuzhou to Guangzhou, with a ticket price of 26,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The drastic changes in climate are a characteristic of Liuzhou. In the morning, when the sun comes out, you wear a single layer of clothing, but after a rain, many people quickly put on their coats. When the sun comes out, they hurry to take off their clothes again. Just putting on and taking off clothes is enough to keep people busy. (Sent from Guifeng Hotel, Liuzhou)</p>
<h3 id="e131">Pleasant Land in Western Yunnan: Wind, Flowers, Snow, and Moon <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Airmail from Dali on the 3rd, Zhen Jun</p>
<p>A fellow countryman from Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) who has lived in Yunnan for eight years weighs 200 pounds. If you ask him when he will go back, his answer is: Shrugging his shoulders, he says, "The climate in Yunnan is too good. I can't stand Shanghai, so I don't want to go back." Indeed, Yunnan Province is the best place in China, maybe even the world, for climate. The year before last, allies came to Kunming from India over the Himalayas, and after getting off the plane, they said, "China is 100 percent better than India." Kunming's cool climate gave them a particularly good impression, and our international standing has been raised considerably.</p>
<p>"If you don't go to Kunming, you don't know that China has such a good place. If you don't go to Dali, you don't know that Yunnan Province has such a good place." This is the famous saying of the party and state elder, Mr. Zhang Puquan, on his recent tour of Yunnan.</p>
<p>"Dali" refers to an irregular rectangle from Xiaguan in the south to Shangguan in the north, backed by the Cangshan Mountains in the east and bordering Erhai Lake in the west. It is about 180 square *li* in area, with a warm climate and abundant products. This place has the red clouds, white snow, and turquoise waters of the Cangshan Mountains, the blue sky, as well as city walls, pavilions, farmhouses, fishing villages, famous flowers, exotic rocks, and ancient temple pagoda shadows. It is truly a pleasant land in western Yunnan.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Dali's wind, flowers, snow, and moon.</p>
<p>Wind</p>
<p>"The wind of Xiaguan." Xiaguan is the most famous town in western Yunnan. The goods of more than 40 counties and five or six administrative bureaus in western Yunnan are gathered and distributed in Xiaguan. Yunnan people say, "Xiaguan can never be filled." Xiaguan is divided into Guan Yi and Guan Wai. North of Yulong Pass belongs to Dali County, and south of the pass belongs to Fengyi County. The two counties share this town. The main street belongs to Fengyi and is very lively. The four major banks, Zhongzhong, Jiaonong, and the banks of Yunnan Province, all have branches here. Hotels and theaters are built quite well. Even the Guzu people (Tibetans) would consider this to be like Shanghai.</p>
<p>Where does the wind of Xiaguan come from? There are two explanations: First, the water of Erhai Lake evaporates and rises upward, encountering the cold currents of the high Cangshan Mountains, turning into a strong wind that cannot dissipate (because Erhai Lake is surrounded by mountains on all sides). Therefore, in autumn and winter, a strong wind may blow several times a day. Second, in the southwest of Xiaguan, there is a narrow valley. The western Yunnan highway follows this valley through Yangbi to Baoshan. This valley is 80 *li* long, with high mountains on both sides and a width of less than 1 *li*. The air is suppressed by the high mountains, forcing it to blow towards Xiaguan. People from Jiangnan say, "It's like wind blowing down a narrow alley." The above are the sources of the wind. According to the people of Xiaguan, the wind comes out of a wind cave, but that is just a myth.</p>
<p>The wind is not terrible for the people of Xiaguan. The wind scatters the dirty air, scatters the dust and loose soil, and blows the weather particularly clear. People feel comfortable. Although the wind blows frequently, the weather is not cold. The people of Xiaguan proudly say, "The wind blows away the diseases of the people of Xiaguan and washes the town of Xiaguan clean."</p>
<p>Flowers</p>
<p>"The flowers of Dali." The county seat of Dali has the beauty of Hangzhou, the sweetness and tranquility of Suzhou, the simplicity of Changzhou, and the magnificence of Nanjing. Sitting at home, you can see the Cangshan Mountains and Erhai Lake. What is most enviable is that every house has a living spring coming down from the Cangshan Mountains, clean and convenient. This is a blessing that we people from Jiangnan cannot enjoy.</p>
<p>Speaking of the flowers of Dali, the late Xian Jiangyin, Mr. Xu Xiake, once recorded: "Going to the Three Pagoda Temple Mountain is beautiful... Above the spring is a large tree, which in early April, blooms flowers like butterflies, with wings and antennae lifelike, no different from real butterflies. There are also tens of thousands of real butterflies hanging upside down from the tree branches to the surface of the spring, colorful and dazzling."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot see such beautiful flowers. According to the locals, the people of Dali hate people from other places coming to see this flower, so they cut it down. Now the tree roots are still there. The flowers we see now are camellias, peonies, etc. Especially in the "March Street," every family brings out the flowers they have grown to compete with each other in beauty. Camellias are as red as the setting sun, and peonies are as large as silver basins. The reporter has not fabricated anything. The climate of Yunnan is suitable for growing flowers, which is the biggest reason.</p>
<p>Snow</p>
<p>"The snow of Cangshan." "Cangshan has nineteen peaks, and snow can be seen on every peak." Indeed, no matter the season, spring, summer, autumn, or winter, the highest peak of Cangshan always has snow. If it rains a little at night, there will be snow on every peak in the morning. Cangshan rises more than 3,000 meters above sea level, and the highest peak has reached the "perpetual snow zone," so it is covered with snow all year round. When we look at the mountain from Fengyi County, it is like a tall man wearing a white raincoat, sitting majestically. If you look at it from Yangbi County behind it, the dark pine forest is draped with a white felt blanket. Therefore, the east gate of Yangbi is called "Snow Reflection Gate," which is very interesting. The snow reflected in people's hearts can emit purity, solemnity, calmness, and elegance. Although the top of Cangshan is covered with snow, the people at the bottom are only wearing thin clothes and still face the warm sun. Isn't this a miracle?</p>
<p>Local legend has it that General Li Mi of the Tang Dynasty conquered the south, and although he reported victory to the court, he later died in this battle due to difficulties in supply. Every time the sky is cloudy, the sound of people and horses neighing can be heard. Later, General Deng Zilong of the Ming Dynasty, who conquered the south, tasted the victory here and built a tomb for ten thousand people to commemorate General Li's achievements, and wrote a poem: "The Tang general conquered the south and reported victory, who pities the dry bones in the dim twilight? Only the impartial snow of Cangshan; drapes white every year to mourn the loyal souls." After that, the sound of people and horses neighing was no longer heard. "White snow mourning loyal souls" is a permanent memorial for us Han people.</p>
<p>Moon</p>
<p>"The moon of Erhai." Erhai is a long and narrow lake. The people of Yunnan have never seen the sea, so they treat the lake as the sea. This is not surprising, as they have seen little and hurried. Because the southwestern plateau is a region with few lakes and marshes, if I want to describe the scenery of rivers and seas, I remember a religious painting, "Jesus Preaching by the Sea of Galilee," with turquoise sea water, red mountains, and a sense of gravity and tranquility. Thinking of the Sea of Galilee in Judea, it is almost the same size as Erhai Lake, right?</p>
<p>What is good about the moon of Erhai? Because the wind in Xiaguan is strong, it blows away every trace of clouds in the sky, so the moonlight is particularly bright. In addition, the clarity of the water reflects under the moon, illuminating as if it were daytime. This is not even the best part. If it is around the 16th, 17th, and 18th days of the lunar calendar, when the moon rabbit rises in the east in the evening, the moon is as big as a wheel, slowly rising from the east mountain, turning from red to yellow, to white. The color of the water in Erhai turns from black to gray to silvery white. In just fifteen minutes, you are given an unexpected wonder. This is the most beautiful moon in the world.</p>
<p>The reporter lingered under the moon in front of Shenglu Park at the foot of Shenglu Peak, facing Erhai Lake. On the white wall are written the words: "Failure to defend the southwest is the shame of the Expeditionary Force." These words are still there. The war has been won, and the government has returned to its capital. We are still in western Yunnan. I also think of the moon over West Lake, the moon over the Huangpu River, the moon over Huangtiandang in Suzhou, and the moon over Taihu Lake in Wuxi. It is the same moon!</p>
<p>A bald pen cannot exhaust the wind, flowers, snow, and moon. I wonder if people who have lived in the bustling cities of Shanghai for a long time also have the elegance to appreciate the scenery of this pleasant land.</p>

<h3 id="e133">The Hope for Genuine Peace <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: Please grant me a corner in your newspaper to publish this letter, allowing ordinary people to speak a few fair words, vent this long-suppressed resentment, and make those who hang up a sheep's head and sell dog meat—those who use democracy as a smokescreen while pursuing selfish gains, promotions, and wealth for a small faction—realize that the people's voice is to be feared, and to examine their actions that harm the country and the nation. During the War of Resistance, we ordinary people suffered the destruction of our homes and the separation of families, enduring hardships and assisting the government in persevering in the war, hoping that after victory, the country would gain freedom, equality, and independence, and we ordinary people would be able to live and work in peace. Where there's a will, there's a way. After eight years of arduous resistance, victory was finally achieved through the blood and sweat of the military and the people. How joyful and encouraged we ordinary people were, thinking that from then on we could live in peace and work happily, couples could reunite, fathers and sons could gather together, and even our relatives and friends who sacrificed for the country's resistance could smile in the afterlife. Little did we know that things would turn out so differently. Although the invaders were driven away, internal strife arose within the family. The flames of war had just subsided here, and there the signal fires were lit again. Therefore, the government convened representatives from various parties and local notables to negotiate and deliberate together, to jointly plan the country's affairs, with the aim of building a modern, democratic, prosperous, and happy nation, and invited General Marshall from the United States to mediate the disputes. The conditions of the Political Consultative Conference were agreed upon, the truce execution teams were dispatched, and General Marshall returned, turning our ordinary people's disappointment and pessimism into excitement and joy. However, not long after, the war in the Northeast broke out, followed by the provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, resulting in countless compatriots being displaced, dying in ditches, and a considerable number sacrificing their lives to guns and cannons. Transportation was disrupted, prices soared, factories closed down, production declined, there were strikes here and requests for leave there, the economy collapsed, and the people could not make a living. Officials lacked sufficient income to remain honest, and corruption became rampant; soldiers could not return home, and acts of banditry occurred frequently. Reconstruction lacked a plan, and nation-building became a problem. The country's situation was precarious, hanging by a thread! All those with a conscience could not help but weep. General Marshall came again, and the worthies and officials of various parties flew back and forth to resume their negotiations. Little did they know that the seven-day truce order had just been issued when conflicts broke out again in the Northeast on the eleventh day. They were negotiating on one hand and fighting on the other. The reason for this was that each had its own position, each had its own background. You were speaking for party A, and I was lobbying for party B, dreaming different dreams in the same bed, not prioritizing the interests of the country and the nation, which led to the discussions becoming more and more distant and the negotiations becoming worse and worse. Therefore, a folk song has recently been discovered in the countryside: "The lord says he is right, the lady says she is right. The lord is right, the lady is right, only the ordinary people are not right. Only the ordinary people are not right. You have democracy, I have democracy, the more democratic the country becomes, the more painful the ordinary people become." Gentlemen, you should know that your salaries and emoluments come from the people's hard-earned money. The foreign houses you live in, the expensive dishes you eat, and the planes you ride in are all taken from the people. The country is based on the people, and the people depend on food for survival. Even in ancient autocratic times, there was still concern for the people. Now that we have democracy, how will you treat the people? Gentlemen! You are happy, but we ordinary people are weeping. You are feasting, but we ordinary people are suffering from hunger and cold. During these ongoing negotiations, I, representing the truly pure ordinary people without party affiliation, propose a few points for your reference: (1) The country's territory must be complete, and its sovereignty must be independent. (2) Only the country's legitimate government can represent the country and exercise all the country's due powers. (3) The people should be supreme, and the people's livelihood should come first, not party interests. (4) Genuine democratic politics should be based on a constitution drafted by a national assembly and a legitimate government produced, not relying on guns, but on the will of the people. (5) A democratic political inspection team should be organized to investigate whether the Soviet Union is democratic and how democracy works in the UK and the US, so as not to be superficial and ruin this good political system. Only by truly practicing the above proposals can we be open and united. Only by practicing the above proposals can we realize genuine democratic politics and build a new China in the future. If we continue to repeat the mistakes of the past and do not prioritize the interests of the country and the nation, the country will be in danger, and you will be in danger. What good will it do you? Even if you can escape the people's punishment, you cannot escape the scorn of history! What do you gentlemen think? By reader Zhang Daquan.</p>
<p>Painful Reactions</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: In the ten months since victory, the appeals and requests presented by the refugees of northern Jiangsu to major newspapers in the recovered areas and to relevant authorities cannot be considered few, but how much actual success has been achieved? I now believe that "begging" and "crying for help" are no longer timely. Fellow refugees! Please understand: society is so turbid, reality is so contradictory, "negotiating and fighting, negotiating and fighting," the officialdom is acting in a play, "united government..." (聯　政府　　　,), the parties are fighting for power, who will sympathize with us? Who will pity us? The world gives us only cold shoulders and silence. We are simply the country's vagrants, the society's castaways. What relief do we want, what comfort do we seek? Sooner or later, it will be the day of death. We have no choice but to petition the government for guns to automatically attack our hometowns. We want to be the support for the two thousand representatives who are petitioning in Nanjing from Zhenjiang. We want to catch up with the vanguard of Xu Hai (over a thousand people) who are returning home armed. We can no longer hesitate; we immediately call for unity. We have no political views whatsoever; we are fighting to the death with the devils for survival. We are by no means driven by impetuous courage, but completely by the facts that compel us to do so. Esteemed editor, my words may be too harsh. However, I must say—please forgive me—this is purely an expression of painful reaction. Respectfully submitted by reader Shen Shaosheng, June 11th.</p>
<p>Where Has Social Compassion Gone?</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: Yesterday, I saw an appeal from a group of refugees in your newspaper's readers' opinions section, and I was deeply moved, to the point that my eyes were filled with tears. I am someone in the same situation as the author. The only difference is that the author is still able to study at Fudan University, while I am an unemployed high school graduate. I have been a refugee in southern Jiangsu for several months, drifting between Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. I have tried my best to find a job to maintain the minimum living standard to avoid starvation, but in this time when there are more people than jobs, even some people with knowledge and experience cannot find work, let alone a greenhorn like me? Studying is something I dare not even dream of. At first, I used the money I brought with me, then I borrowed small amounts from acquaintances, and finally, I drifted along. Enduring hunger and starvation is common, and cement floors and temples are my old friends at night. I have appealed to all sides, but people have responded with cold shoulders. I have registered and applied for relief from relief agencies countless times, but the result is waiting for a written notice, which has disappeared without a trace! The country has abandoned us! It has kicked us, a group of probably useless people, out of society! Please, adults and gentlemen of society, do not neglect us, do not be indifferent, thinking that it has nothing to do with you. The unemployment of educated youth will increase social unrest, and joining the Communist Party will increase the seriousness of the situation. Social chaos and the deterioration of the situation will affect the safety of your positions and property! At the same time, I hope that the government will improve the relief organizations and strengthen the relief efforts, so that they are not just things that are nominal and benefit the intermediaries, but are agencies that enable capable people to make the best use of their talents and allow refugee youth to return to school and find employment. Otherwise, the responsibility for "forcing rebellion" should be borne by those who force it, and should not be the responsibility of those who are forced. Sir, a person with a sense of justice would not consider my words to be provocative, right? Respectfully submitted by Guo Xiu, June 10th.</p>
<h3 id="e134">The Quiet West China Dam <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Chengdu, 5th (Air Dispatch) Guo Hong</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the West China Dam was always envied as a "Shangri-La"; and at present, although many people who have lived in the interior for a long time are going to the prosperous Shanghai in the recovered areas, the capital city with its officials gathering together, the classic-style Beijing, the clean and tidy Qingdao and Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other places, in a sense, given the terrible situation of the flames of civil war spreading everywhere and the general surge in prices, the West China Dam is still like a "Shangri-La".</p>
<p>The Current State of "Shangri-La"</p>
<p>The West China Dam is a "dam" – in the customary application of the word "dam", there is a great difference between the people of Sichuan Province and the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces: in the latter, "dam" often refers to "river embankment", while in the former, it refers to "open space". —It is located to the south of Chengdu city, less than five hundred steps out of the New South Gate, so it is adjacent to the city area.</p>
<p>As soon as people enter the dam, they will immediately feel that they are in another environment, except for the sidewalks paved with pebbles or coal slag, there is very little so-called "Chinese flavor." What jumps into your field of vision first are those large buildings, its roof tiles are made in the palace style, the sides of the building are opened with rows of glass windows, and at the entrance below, there are wide stone steps, and below the stone steps is a lawn; the surrounding area also has a winding corridor: showing a majestic appearance. Trees are planted everywhere on the sidewalks and in the open spaces, and in spring and summer, there is a green shade, mixed with pink and light purple flowers, making it even more beautiful and moving.</p>
<p>The entire dam is about half a square li, all of which is the site of West China University. The school's facilities are extremely complete, with museums, physics and chemistry buildings, libraries, etc., all of which are available. There is also a towering spire-shaped building, which is the "clock tower", which reports the standard time on time; when it rings loudly, it can be heard a li away. Inside, there are also two lawns – which are also sports fields, the smaller one can accommodate thousands of people, and the larger one is more than twice as large as the former. In addition, there is also a large-scale hospital, an office of a bank, and various snack shops that have emerged in response.</p>
<p>But what is regrettable is that this paradise was not created by its own efforts, but was given by the Christian Church.</p>
<p>Melting Pot of Students</p>
<p>Before the war, there were only a few hundred college students on the dam, and more than 90% of them were from Sichuan; but after the war, Yenching, Qilu, Jinling Universities, and Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences moved here one after another, so the students' hometowns covered any province or city in the country. It is by no means an exaggeration to call it a "melting pot of students from all provinces." Not only that, in addition, there are several young boys and girls of British, American, and French nationality decorating it, and what is even more worth mentioning is this Indian lady, whose skin color and clothing are most noticeable to the people in the interior.</p>
<p>Sad Talk about the Academic Atmosphere</p>
<p>The author stayed on the dam for a semester and is not unfamiliar with the atmosphere and living conditions of the students here. A friend who graduated from West China University around the 20th year of the Republic of China once said to me with emotion: "When we were studying, most of our time after class was spent on the sports field or reading general books, but now the students, hum!" I know what my friend's "hum" represents. Generally speaking, the academic atmosphere on the dam is not very good. According to the author's observation, it is far worse than that of the students with less porcelain, and the extravagant life far exceeds it. What is the reason for this? That should be a long story, so there is no need to draw conclusions here, but the students' wealthy family economy is a subsidiary factor. Dating is their daily routine; dancing is even more of a daily pastime. At the dances held in some private houses here, the main guests are these young masters and ladies. Otherwise, they go in groups to watch soft Hollywood movies, and most of them can only feel it intuitively, lacking the ability to appreciate and criticize; the fashion of going to teahouses is particularly prevalent, often four or five people surround a table, put their feet up, smoke cigarettes, and play "bridge" games, which is really eye-catching. When the Allied forces gathered in Chengdu for a period of time, the licentious behavior of some female students was widely rumored; although it was quite discriminated against by the citizens and criticized by the media, it did not diminish slightly; some of them were naturally willing to fall, and some were forced to do so because of the difficulty of economic sources, but this is always equally painful.</p>
<p>The Schools Have Resumed</p>
<p>With the arrival of victory, the schools that moved inland have resumed their original locations one after another. Yenching University, Qilu University, Jinling University, and Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences all ended their courses in mid-April; as the host, West China University also took a vacation in early May because its professors and courses had reciprocal relations with various schools.</p>
<p>The first to resume were Ginling Women's College and Ginling Men's College, and the first batch of teachers and students set off for Beijing before the end of April. The former has now been fully completed, and the latter can also be completed before the end of May. The second is Yenching University, which opened the first batch of resumption matters in early May, and then shipped two more batches in succession, and is expected to end in mid-June. The most delayed and the most difficult is Qilu University. The current Shandong is the most severely chaotic province in China, and whether the transportation problem to Jinan can be solved is really very slim. Although the school opened a resumption train in mid-May, it was not going to Jinan, but to transport some of the teachers and students from Pingjin back to their hometowns. Most of the teachers and students are still left in Chengdu, and it has not been decided when they will leave, but the school authorities have issued a regulation, that is, they must report to the Jinan school before September 20. May these young students who escaped from the enemy's fire line not step into their own people's fire line again.</p>
<p>The Silence on the Dam</p>
<p>One evening, the author made a special trip to the dam for a tour. All the scenery is still the same, but the footprints of young people are scarce, the bright lights have been reduced, and the various bulletin boards are leaning to the east and west, with only a little residue left on them. Several snack shops were closed. At "To Play the Lute to a Cow" (the music practice room of West China University), the sound of a piano and the jade-like singing voice of a high-pitched soprano used to be constantly ringing, but now they are all silent.</p>
<p>In the twilight, I wandered on a wide and deserted sidewalk; the evening breeze blew through the tall green willows, rustling over my head; a feeling of shivering hit me, and I couldn't help but shiver.</p>

<p>(1) Gao Yuhua: Esteemed Editor: In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the reader and Mr. Shi jointly operated a certain business in a certain place, agreeing to end it in five years, and electing Mr. Shi as general manager, while I served as chairman of the board, not working in the business. Stock certificates were printed, stipulating the end of the term in the end of 1937. Unexpectedly, the July 7th Incident occurred that year, and the place was also a transportation hub, and it was not ended in time. Soon after, it fell into enemy hands. Because the reader lived in another county, I was unable to go there in person. The situation of Mr. Shi after the fall into enemy hands was unknown. After more than a year of inquiries from various parties, I learned that Mr. Shi had not suffered any losses, and had returned to the original site in a certain place to do business. I immediately asked him to end the business, but was refused. I was only given a certain amount of money for travel expenses, and I silently accepted it and returned because the place was under enemy occupation and there was no way to reason. After several letters of urging, he was ultimately ignored. After victory in the autumn of the 34th year (1945), Mr. Shi became even more unscrupulous, making a big show and actually resuming business at the original site under the original name. The reader immediately sent someone to go there and wrote a sincere letter, still hoping to maintain harmony, hoping to get a fair and effective answer, but they were ignored and returned. What steps should be taken in law to negotiate? Please provide an answer.</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui answers: According to the provisions of Article 675 of the Civil Code, partners may inspect the partnership's affairs and property status at any time and may inspect the books. You can first check the accounts and then, in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Recovery, if it is obviously unfair, you can sue the court for a fair ruling on the payment.</p>
<p>(2) Chen Mingkang asks: Five years ago, my father used 300 yuan in legal tender in his hometown to mortgage a building from a certain gentleman. The contract was for five years, and both parties held a signed contract as proof. Now that the term has expired, the homeowner intends to declare that he will still use the original price of 300 yuan in legal tender to redeem the mortgaged house. However, the current cost of living is high, and the value of the currency cannot be compared with that of five years ago. How should this be resolved? Please advise.</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui answers: In accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Recovery, if it is obviously unfair, a request can be made to the court for a fair ruling to increase or decrease the payment.</p>
<p>(3) Wang Dejun asks: My husband and I have been married for more than 20 years, and we have a large number of children, and the eldest son is already married. Unexpectedly, in recent years, my husband has ignored the family's expenses. Upon careful investigation, I learned that he has an affair. Now I have the following questions, please answer. (1) Now that my parents-in-law are still alive, can I ask my parents-in-law to transfer the family property that my husband is entitled to under his name to me, for safekeeping and as marriage expenses for my children? What method should be used to request the transfer in order to be effective? (2) If we divorce and request alimony, but my husband has no cash, can I request that the aforementioned property that my husband is entitled to under his name be transferred to my custody? (3) Although my husband has an affair, he has not made it public. If I unilaterally request a divorce, what method must be used in order to be effective?</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Ya Kui answers: (1) Inheritance has not yet begun and cannot be transferred. (2) Not possible. (3) In accordance with Article 1052, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, there must be evidence in order to request a divorce.</p>

<p>Lu Shoushan Asks About Ship Schedules: Esteemed Sirs: My relative currently lives in the countryside in Wuxi and intends to go to Shantou to visit relatives this month. Because the departure dates of the various shipping companies are only published in the newspaper three or four days in advance, those who live deep in the countryside, by the time they learn of the ship schedule and set off for Shanghai, may miss the opportunity to purchase tickets or not be able to arrive before departure. If they come to Shanghai to wait for the ship, the burden would be too heavy. We have always admired your organization's sincere service. Please answer: (1) Is there a fixed cycle for ships sailing to Shantou? (2) How many ships will sail to Shantou this month?</p>
<p>(Our newspaper's shipping reporter, Qu Nian, answers):</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has one ship per week, and Jardine Matheson and Swire, two British shipping companies, also have ships sailing to Shantou, but the dates have not been determined.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>In Beijing opera, there's often the line, "This humble one is guilty and dare not raise my head." Why dare they not raise their heads? In a word, it's because they "can't face people."</p>
<p>Yesterday, when Ren Xingya and Shao Jigao were taken into custody in the grain and goods case, reporters followed and took photos one after another. However, Ren and Shao each used a newspaper to cover their faces. What was the purpose? They feared "losing face"!</p>
<p>This kind of thing is very common. We news reporters often encounter roundabout requests, such as, "The news can be published, but please be lenient with the photos." The so-called importance of face is probably especially evident in such situations. Otherwise, prisons must have roofs and ceilings, right? Why would those traitors need American sunglasses? (See the "News Small World" section of the 18th's edition).</p>
<p>We all know that after a person dies, before the body is dressed for burial, customs dictate that a piece of paper is placed over their face. Some say this is to prevent other animals from passing by; the deceased senses their breath and becomes a walking corpse. Another explanation is that the dead person's face is unsightly, which would cause their family—the living—to have ugly and terrifying thoughts, thus reducing their feelings of grief. In my opinion, the latter explanation is more rational, more scientific, and the basis for the saying, "dying to save face" probably lies here.</p>
<p>I remember in Japan, the entire head of a condemned prisoner is put in a bamboo basket. The intention is the same. This seems more lenient than our practice of parading criminals through the streets. In fact, the law originally intended to show them to the public. Before being taken to the execution ground, they're given a large bowl of wine and a large piece of meat, focusing on the practical and preserving face for that brief moment. It's truly incomprehensible. Matthew 23:25 says:</p>
<p>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Drinking Coffee <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>That afternoon, before three o'clock, my younger uncle and I went into the basement of a large building, chose a sofa seat to the left of the "Clever Man," and each ordered a cup of coffee—the first time I'd tasted it in over three years.</p>
<p>Although I'd lingered on the brink of starvation, and could say I'd never really eaten my fill during the war, I'd often been able to get my hands on coffee. First, of course, was that I liked it, and second, friends often treated me. When friends treated me, I didn't have to spend money, but if I liked it myself, I had to save three coppers from my food allowance. (Coffee was three coppers a cup by the roadside before). Although it wasn't as delicious as when friends treated me, it was still a consolation and better than nothing, better than "passing a butcher's shop and just smelling the meat."</p>
<p>I never imagined coffee would become extinct and replaced with roasted black bean powder, which was so bitter and astringent, it was no different from drinking "Wang Lao Ji" bitter tea. Moreover, the "Clever Man" had changed its sign, and going there might even lead to some panic. Therefore, I became estranged from that place for several years. Actually, lingering on my last breath in a place where I didn't know where I would die, I couldn't help but turn my thoughts to drinking coffee.</p>
<p>The essence of coffee is, of course, bitter. A long time ago, when I was wandering the mysterious streets of Shanghai, I often went to drink bitter coffee, wanting to understand the taste of life from its bitterness and astringency. But roasted black bean powder doesn't have this profound bitterness, just like "Wang Lao Ji" bitter tea, you can't taste the bitterness and astringency that you find in coffee. Therefore, I symbolized this taste as coffee, and only those who drink coffee can understand the true essence of life. Thus, I thought that the true essence of life could be symbolized by coffee, and coffee became a product of urban culture.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was cut off from coffee for several years, and I was thrown into a deep abyss, an ice cellar, almost unable to be reborn.</p>
<p>Today, it is related to me again. It can be considered that world humanity and justice have been extended, allowing me, who was trapped in the darkness, to see the national flag and the light of day! So I especially cherish the cup of coffee brought by the waiter from Wenzhou, wearing a white shirt and black pants with the trousers tied up.</p>
<p>Facing the coffee—the cup of coffee placed in front of me—I was in a trance, staring at it, intently staring at it, loving it, lovingly and eagerly in my heart, a smile that I haven't shown for many years spread across my face, the corners of the old and withered skin of my mouth simply hanging like that, could reveal how happy I was in my heart. I forgot everything, my heart, mouth, and eyes were really only on the cup of coffee in front of me.</p>
<p>Coffee lifted my spirits in illness, and it also filled my strength in illness, while I drank that cup of coffee.</p>
<p>It seemed that I was no longer sick when I finished drinking that cup of coffee.</p>
<p>I became strange, and flashed suspicious eyes at the empty cup of coffee, but obviously I was in high spirits because of it.</p>
<p>But my illness will not be cured. How can a cup of coffee cure my illness? It's just that old friends have reunited, and the depression that has been built up for a long time has been opened up a little.</p>
<p>I planned to have another cup, but my uncle insisted that I have some "Western pastries."</p>
<p>I couldn't refuse, and took a bite of the cake. The softness, tenderness and sweetness of the cake can be said to be another kind of life.</p>
<p>However, I don't need to understand the taste of a cake-like life, and I don't want to understand it either. Because I have passed the cake-like life, and it has passed long ago. Now, there is only a "Wang Lao Ji" life, but I want to taste the bitterness and astringency of coffee again from "Wang Lao Ji."</p>
<p>I finally ordered another cup of coffee, and I immediately felt leisurely and forgot everything.</p>
<p>Note: The author of this article is in Hong Kong. "Clever Man" is the name of a coffee shop on Des Voeux Road Central in Hong Kong. "Wang Lao Ji" is a kind of herbal tea in Guangdong, which has the effect of removing food accumulation.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Analysis of Crimes of Passion <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>To avenge a woman's infidelity or her firm rejection of his love, older men often murder the woman to vent the anger in their hearts. But young perpetrators of crimes of passion mostly murder their rivals in love, usually stemming from verbal insults during arguments.</p>
<p>This is the conclusion reached by Dr. Bo Road and Dr. Fox of the University of Illinois in the United States, after studying two hundred perpetrators of crimes of passion over five years.</p>
<p>In southern Michigan prisons, the average age of perpetrators of crimes of passion is higher than the average age of general prisoners. The former is thirty-four years old, while the latter is just over twenty-nine years old. The education level and intelligence of perpetrators of crimes of passion are very low.</p>
<p>Older people commit more violent acts due to jealousy than they do when committing crimes due to other motivations, while young perpetrators of crimes of passion are the opposite.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Sacrificial Items <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>During grand sales with discounts and price reductions, shops typically designate a few items with price tags labeled "sacrificial items."</p>
<p>"Sacrificial item," what a stimulating term! The so-called sacrifice means that this type of product is sold at a price lower than the cost. It is specially selected to treat customers favorably. Therefore, everyone who sees sacrificial items in the display window has to stop and take a look. If the item is truly cheap and useful, they will unconsciously go in to buy it.</p>
<p>I consider myself a careful friend when buying things. Sometimes when I need a certain item, I will run to several stores, constantly looking at the display windows to see which one is cheaper. The saying "compare three stores and you won't suffer a loss" is, in my opinion, the principle of purchasing goods. Therefore, I have tried a few times with sacrificial items. But as a result, I have gradually become less stimulated by them and do not trust them. Now I am even more convinced that all sacrificial items are not cheap goods.</p>
<p>The reason why I am indifferent to sacrificial items to the point of not even bothering to look at them is, of course, not without reason. In the past, when I went to buy sacrificial items, I often suffered the pain of being squeezed out. Some stores, if you go a step late, will tell you that the time has passed and come tomorrow. Some stores, facing a group of customers in front of them, pretend to supervise strictly, slowly handing out the items, and even choosing acquaintances to give them to. When the time is up, or the goods are gone, they say "see you tomorrow," and you have squeezed for half a day in vain. Like a dumb person eating Coptis chinensis, there is no place to complain.</p>
<p>Even if you can sometimes buy them, the toothpaste is lumpy, the socks are discolored, the clothing material has holes, the food has a smell... everything is somewhat spoiled and cannot be sold as good goods, so it is used as a sacrificial item. What is the use of buying this kind of thing? Although the price is cheap, you are actually being fooled. But if you are fooled once or twice at most, you will naturally become indifferent to sacrificial items and will not be fooled again.</p>
<p>People who want to buy cheap goods are originally foolish worms. Who doesn't want to make money when opening a store? And who is willing to lose money? If you want to buy something that is even less than the cost price, your starting point is wrong. Otherwise, where would those big bosses get their foreign houses and cars?</p>
<p>From sacrificial items, I extrapolate to big discounts and big sales. How many truly discounted goods are there? Most of them are also second-rate goods. Are the prices of clothing materials that offer three yards or buy one yard get one free the same as those that do not offer a discount or a free gift? I have seen several stores that have been half-open all year round, covered with red and green paper strips, holding closing down sales, but they have not closed down after seven or eight years. Well, all of this is the gimmick of merchants, otherwise how could they attract so many customers to the door? Sacrifice has a price, and so does sacrificing goods.</p>

<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Star East Football Team came to Shanghai to compete, and by last Saturday, they had played four games, with a total ticket revenue of over 70 million yuan. Star East received 48%, Yiyuan Stadium's venue fee was 30%, and the Football Association received 22%. It is expected that when the entire schedule is completed, each member of Star East will receive around 5 million yuan, excluding expenses. The number cannot be said to be small. But compared to the amount of 900,000 US dollars that American black boxing king Joe Louis can get in a boxing match, one cannot help but feel that this is a small matter compared to a big one. However, compared to the current treatment of public officials, 5 million yuan is equivalent to two years' salary, so it is more than enough compared to those below.</p>
<p>According to side reports, this autumn, ball king Li Huitang also intends to lead the Hong Kong South China team to Shanghai for competition. From this point of view, Shanghai is still a "golden world."</p>
<p>Nanjing newspaper reported: Liu Kai, a famous gambler nicknamed Liu Three Swords, was recently searched by the police, and two mahjong tables were seized on the spot. Among the eight gamblers, there were five nuns. Some say that the nuns gambling is because their mortal heart has not receded and their six senses have not been purified. I say: "Mortal heart" and "six senses" are too abstract. After all, nuns are also people. The empty door is lonely, and it is inevitable to move the pole of thought. However, the other three gamblers who approached the empty door have a bit of Bodhisattva heart.</p>
<p>Han Lingen's participation in "Home of Loyalty" has been gradually calmed after Wu Yonggang published a defense. It is heard that the view of the filmmakers who went against the Party on this matter is: "I am afraid that the Shanghai movie stars will take back the territory." Right or wrong, let's not discuss it for the time being, but in my opinion, it is best to have fewer nobodies in the Home of Loyalty!</p>
<p>Chief Chen has recently issued an order: Jeeps are not allowed to carry girls in the future. If Shanghai can also implement this, at least the incidents of hitting people can be reduced somewhat.</p>
<p>Since President Ma of the Central Daily News in Nanjing attacked extravagance and decadence, and Mayor Ma ordered the banning of dancing, the dance halls have closed down one after another, seeking a way out, changing to performing Qingchang, and competing to hire singers as a gimmick. The "Metropolitan" dance hall has been leased to the First Engineering Office of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications, serving as staff dormitories, with an annual rent of over 10 million yuan. Someone said it wonderfully: this is the result of "two Mas fighting, affecting the dance floor."</p>

<p>— Deng Xi</p>
<p>There are really many American goods that have come to China with victory: Jeep cards, khaki cloth, American flour, American silk, American butter, American milk powder, American beer, American coffee, American suits, American combs, American glasses, American belts, ... and recently advertisements for American rice have appeared in the newspapers.</p>
<p>The Chinese people's clothing, food, housing, transportation, and things to use, play with, and ride in... everything is supplied by American goods here, which are cheap, high-quality, and fashionable.</p>
<p>The fashionable men and women walking on the street are chewing American bubble gum "click, click." This is Americanizing life, which is both fashionable and glorious, and now the rice they eat is also American goods. It seems that this American rice has grains as big as dates, as white as snow, as fragrant as ginseng fruit, and as soft as... and the top-notch white japonica rice, which has always been valued by Chinese people in Shanghai, will also be defeated.</p>
<p>When entertaining guests, when serving the rice, the host solemnly introduces "This rice is cooked with American rice." How loud, how fashionable, how glorious?</p>
<p>The emperors of history enjoyed all the delicacies of the mountains and seas, but they never ate foreign rice. Now, we ordinary people who can enjoy American rice are better off than the emperors in terms of taste, which is really enough to be proud of!</p>
<p>When eating American rice again, I don't know if there is a description—a leaflet—recording its method of eating. We would really like to learn and try it.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Remembering Mr. Zhu Shaoping <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Shaoping was brutally murdered by Japanese pirates while serving as a consul in the Philippines. His death was on April 17, 1942. It was not confirmed until recently that he was forced by the enemy to dig his own grave and then buried alive. At the same time, all walks of life in this city also held a memorial service for Mr. Zhu Shaoping at the Pudong Native Place Association. Thus, this generation of educators passed away forever.</p>
<p>I got to know Mr. Zhu Shaoping at the Global Elementary School. At that time, he was living in seclusion in Shanghai, in charge of the progress of the Global Student Union, and concurrently serving as the principal of the Global Elementary School. He devoted his life to education and journalism, and served as the chairman of Qixiu Women's Middle School; during the revolution, he was the initiator and leader of the "Southern Society," and Liu Yazi would probably have to be mentioned after him. He made the greatest efforts in the work of promoting the revolution. During the "May Fourth" student movement, he personally led the students to run around and appeal, even neglecting food and sleep, and weeping bitterly. His spirit influenced us a lot, and his contribution to the country can be said to be very great. Unfortunately, the Philippine Islands were captured by the Japanese army, and this great old man finally died for the country.</p>
<p>He was serious and meticulous in running education during his lifetime. Even the most trivial things, he handled seriously and would not neglect them. For example, he would personally go to the toilet every morning to inspect it. The students often laughed at him, but he still seriously regarded it as a routine daily task. If the toilet lid was not put down properly, or the walls were covered with boring words, then he would make a big discussion at the memorial week.</p>
<p>Speaking of memorial week reminds me of an interesting incident. His native accent was very heavy, so the word "Zhu Wei" (各位) was often misheard as "Cifan" (粢飯, a type of rice roll). Once he said with emotion during the memorial week: "The Chinese are often so poor that they can't even afford porridge for breakfast." Then he wanted to get proof from the students. Sure enough, a student replied in a very sincere tone: "Cifan is indeed like this." The audience burst into laughter, but he said very seriously: "This is really an unfortunate thing, how can you still laugh?" It can be seen that he was loyal. At that time, Mr. Zhu's age was quite high, and his bald head was very bright under the light. The students jokingly called him "light bulb," and he never got angry.</p>

<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>Hearing that Yijiangmen in Nanjing will be changed to Arc de Triomphe, I remembered the many stone steps of the Arc de Triomphe outside the Military Commission on Linsen Road in Chongqing. After walking all the stone steps, I was already sweating profusely and my legs were limp. Indeed, if we are only afraid of leg limpness and are unwilling to sweat, we will not even think about passing through this glorious and great Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p>After the victory, Hua Nan cultural traitor Li Pingfu will issue an obituary to feign death and hide in Hong Kong. It is recently learned that he has been included in the first batch of traitor lists by the Guangzhou Military Camp. Li then issued an obituary recently and instructed his family to observe filial piety and implement the second feigned death. I don’t think it will work. The so-called think three times before you act (sound of 思死 is harmonious), of course there will be one more death. As for whether the third time is a feigned death? Still dying of illness, or being arrested and executed? That depends on his "forehead."</p>
<p>This city's imports in April exceeded exports of local goods by twenty times. In today's post-war domestic material shortage, it is a good phenomenon, because while desperately dragging in, while staying without going out, there is hope for abundant materials, which is in line with the "increasing revenue and reducing expenditure" principle, why bother to worry about things that have not happened.</p>
<p>It is said that the Taiwan Provincial Assembly pointed out the points for the government to improve, and the most fierce question was the fact that the concubine of Director Ye of the Inspection Bureau was filled with a technician, which made a lot of noise. It must be denied that it is a matter of admiration that the concubine can support herself, if she can really be competent.</p>

<p>Shanghai people always like to call young people young masters, and at the same time they are quite willing to accept them. Whether they are real young masters or fake young masters, they are full of vanity. They feel that only this title can continue to show their noble status. Therefore, vanity permeates Shanghai, east and west are young masters.</p>
<p>The beggars' cries of young masters aroused the joy of these young masters, and perhaps they will reward you with a hundred yuan ticket. The waiters in taverns and teahouses shouted a few times as young masters, in exchange for more small accounts.</p>
<p>But the so-called young masters; a group of real young masters, they rely on their parents' property, do not do their jobs properly, call friends and invite them to buy wine and have fun, spend all night indulging in pleasure, and squander their wealth. They don't know the difficulty of making money. They only have consumption and will not produce. This group of national dregs, social worms, and family parasites is the so-called young masters.</p>
<p>What is especially pitiful is a group of fake young masters. They are mostly junior staff members of companies or shops and have met this group of real young masters. In the carnival, someone called him a young master, especially the beloved woman, he was so happy that he forgot his identity. He needs to maintain the nobility of a young master to win the favor of a beauty. Luxurious clothing and lavish parades are necessary conditions for young masters, but how can a meager salary for barely making a living provide for his squandering? Before the end of the month, the salary has been overdrawn, "dying for face and suffering," first borrowing from the east and moving from the west, then pawning and selling, and finally perhaps staging a living drama of escape in the possible.</p>
<p>Young master, young master, what a despicable and shameful term this is!</p>

<h3 id="e150">"We Want to Study!" <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Hui</p>
<p>I remember a few months ago when Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua first arrived in Shanghai, a group of students marched and petitioned, shouting slogans loudly: "We want to study!" We feel that it is really commendable that there are still people shouting that they want to study in this era. To be honest, there are too few people who want to study these days. "Scholars" have become a special class in China, and this meaning seems to say that Chinese people can be divided into two categories: scholars and non-scholars. It's also pitiful to say that even "scholars" don't read books anymore. Students should be reading, but as far as current college students are concerned, we want to ask how many are studying? In the past, college students read reference books in addition to textbooks. Later, they only read textbooks, and now they don't even read textbooks. University professors should be reading books, right? But as far as I know, there are probably only a handful of people who still read books when teaching at universities. Those who have just come out to teach still flip through some reference books to prepare lectures. Old educators have used their notes from their studies abroad twenty years ago to become authorities, and it seems useless to read books anymore. As for others, businessmen don't have the time to read books, workers don't have the strength to read books, and ordinary politicians and dignitaries have more important things to do than reading books, so they don't have time for this.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are still two kinds of people in Shanghai who are reading books. One is the ladies and gentlemen of the leisure class and the staff of company agencies. The wives are unwilling to take care of the children because they want to read books; the staff also have to temporarily give up their jobs because they are reading books. It turns out that they are all reading the weekly newspapers of yellow news with anger and forgetting food! There is also another kind of scholars who are ordinary innocent children. They are unwilling to go home after school, save the money for eating candy, sit on the book stalls by the roadside, and watch speed loop pictures. This is their only spiritual food.</p>
<p>We often hear advanced educators shouting: "Down with book education!" They have succeeded. Long live the new educators!</p>
<h3 id="e151">Family and the Civil Code <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Guangdan</p>
<p>…Review of Zhao Fengjie’s Annotations on the Kinship Section of the Civil Code…</p>
<p>In the past decade or so, there have been quite a few authors who have written specialized books on the kinship section of the Civil Code. The works of Yu Qichang, Xu Zhaoyang, Yu Yi, Huang Youchang, Tao Huizeng, Cao Jie, Hu Changqing, and Zhong Hongsheng all appeared before or during the early stages of the War of Resistance. Zhao Fengjie's *Annotations on the Kinship Section of the Civil Code*, written during the War of Resistance but only recently published by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau and printed by Zhengzhong Book Company, is another addition.</p>
<p>The structure of this book is generally similar to other works of the same kind; that is, it mostly discusses or comments on the chapters, sections, and articles of the kinship section of the Civil Code in order. The entire book is divided into two parts: an introduction and a main body. The main body is further divided into seven chapters: general principles, family, marriage, parents and children, guardianship, support, and kinship council, each chapter containing several sections. Two appendices are included at the end: one is the review opinion on the preliminary points of the kinship law passed by the Central Political Conference of the Kuomintang, and the other is the interpretation examples of the kinship section of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>Compared with previous works, this book has many noteworthy features. From the reviewer's perspective, there are at least a few points that should be earnestly introduced to the reader.</p>
<p>1. The Family is the Center of Social Life</p>
<p>It is commendable that the author can pay full attention to the family system without undue emphasis or negligence. The family is the starting point of social life, as well as the center of gravity for social life, and even the true unit of social life. Whether from thousands of years of human experience or from the comparative scientific sociological theories since Comte over a century ago, it can be said that this has become a consensus. However, the drafters of the kinship section of the Civil Code, failing to observe the distorted development of the Chinese family system in the past, and misled by some contemporary trends of thought, threw the baby out with the bathwater, placing the chapter on "Family" in the sixth position, even after "Guardianship" and "Support," and the regulations on the family system are only a few. The author believes that this is a fundamental mistake that must be corrected. Therefore, in the order of discussion, he moved "Family" from the sixth position to the second position, immediately after the chapter on general principles, and explained this in the first item of the introductory remarks, saying, "Since the 'family' in our Civil Code is based on the principle of a community of relatives living together, it should follow the precedents of previous drafts and place it above 'Marriage' and 'Parents and Children'; moreover, according to the inferences of sociologists, it is also believed that marriage originates from the family, and it cannot be said that the family originates from marriage. Therefore, this book lists 'Family' as the second chapter."</p>
<p>This spirit of upholding a sound family system is consistently maintained by the author throughout the book. For example, regarding his view on divorce, he advocates neither excessive restriction nor excessive freedom. He says, "If divorce is too free, there will be no peaceful days for society and the family; therefore, in order to consolidate the family and seek the health of future generations, efforts should be made to reduce its occurrence" (p. 107). Also, regarding the adoption of a female child by a single man, the kinship section of the Civil Code does not explicitly stipulate anything. Previous legal scholars such as Hu Changqing advocated that adoption should be allowed, but the author believes that adoption should be prohibited in principle, and in special circumstances, the court can make a decision. This may not seem like a significant point on the surface, but it actually has a great impact. The increase in the number of single people is largely due to the lack of a sound family system in the contemporary era, and partly due to the consequences of an unsound family system. Although the principle of "no resentful women within, no unmarried men without" may seem old-fashioned, marriage is indeed a major condition for a sound personality and social stability, which is not necessarily a conclusion of modern sociology, and there are statistical figures to prove it. Therefore, to maintain the soundness of the family, the trend of singleness must be corrected at the same time. This is the first point. People who have the ability and interest to adopt other people's daughters as their own are in fact not fundamentally unsuitable for marriage. The prohibition of adoption in principle can to some extent reduce the tendency toward singleness, because if elderly men cannot attempt adoption, then when they are young, they cannot but make some plans for marriage and family. This is the second point. An elderly single man making plans to adopt other people's children may appear to form a family with a father and daughter, but in reality, it is not a true family. There is a difference between true and false that cannot be ignored. This is the third point. An old man and a young girl living alone in a room, nominally father and daughter, are actually like husband and wife. In terms of social morality and order, the law cannot but assume some responsibility for preventing problems before they arise. Hu Changqing affirmed this, believing that since the Civil Code has clearly stipulated that the age of the adopter should be more than twenty years older than the adoptee, there is usually no possibility of sexual or marital relations occurring. This is an impractical argument that only knows legal principles but does not understand physiology. The author has refuted this, and his views are very correct (p. 167). The reviewer can further say that sexual relations between an old man and a young girl are not only possible but also easy. When a man is around fifty years old, it is a major turning point in his sexual physiology. Actions such as marrying a young wife, having relations with maidservants, supporting actresses, adopting goddaughters, and even raping young girls mostly occur at this turning point. However, if a man within this age range adopts in name, how can one be sure that he has no other intentions? Or even if he sincerely adopts in the beginning, how can one guarantee that he will not change the relationship later? Every added example of change further erodes and shakes the entire family system. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>For example, when the author discusses the issue of guardianship of minors, he advocates that, in addition to parents being the natural guardians, the position of the legal guardian should be prior to that of the testamentary guardian because the legal guardian is ultimately a member of the family, while the testamentary guardian is an outsider. He says that China's situation is different from other countries, "Large families still exist in rural societies, and even in cities, they are not all small families. Family affairs are often controlled by the elders in the family. Once the parents die, parental authority is exercised by the grandparents or uncles and aunts who are the heads of the family, which has become a customary practice. If the deceased father or mother designates an outsider as the guardian of their children, there will inevitably be conflicts between parental authority and the authority of the head of the family, and the closeness of relatives in the same room will be damaged, which is not good for the family."</p>
<p>2. Where Does the Center of Gravity of the Family Lie?</p>
<p>Since the family system is the center of gravity for social life, then to seek the soundness of the family system, the family must have its own appropriate center of gravity. This is another point that the book pays special attention to, and it is consistently maintained throughout. The point already discussed above that the position of the legal guardian should be prior to that of the testamentary guardian is also an example of this. The center of gravity of a family is in the parents. When the parents die, the center of gravity is lost, so there must be a legal guardian to re-establish this center of gravity. The testamentary guardian is an outsider, and in name only a guardian, and in reality, has nothing to do with the restoration of the center of gravity, so his position should be after the legal guardian. The author takes the same attitude toward the guardianship of interdicted persons; even if they are both legal guardians, the Civil Code places the spouse before the parents, but the author believes that "according to the circumstances of most Chinese families, cohabiting parents should be ranked first, followed by the spouse, and then non-cohabiting parents; and according to foreign legal precedents, the spouse is not always placed in the absolute first position."</p>
<p>The Civil Code stipulates that "husband and wife are each other's agents in daily household affairs." The author strongly criticizes this point, and the most important reason for his criticism is that he wants to maintain the center of gravity of the family system based on the ancient principle of "two things cannot be too great." This is very correct. The wife can be the husband's agent, and the husband can be the wife's agent, but it depends on the occasion, the need, and whether one party has a problem and must be represented by someone else, but to say that in ordinary times, at any time, in daily life, husband and wife are each other's agents, that is indeed inappropriate. The author gives an example, saying that if a husband or wife goes out to buy something for thirty yuan a day, according to the principle of agency, they must each be responsible for fifteen yuan. "If husband and wife haggle over every penny like this, it is worse than shareholders in a partnership, and what affection is there between spouses? Therefore, adhering to this view, this legal triviality is extremely restrictive of human nature and creates an unprecedentedly bad example" (p. 96). The system of separate property for husband and wife, in the last one or two decades, even those who advocate gender equality and women's economic independence most strongly, such as England's Linglishi, have begun to doubt it, believing that it is inappropriate in terms of emotion and reason. Now, if the legislator, in principle, advocates "absolute" equality between men and women, then economic facts must be separate property, and the law must have provisions for mutual agency. If economic life is like this, then other aspects of life must also be like this—an unsound view will inevitably lead to theoretical confusion and unsolvable problems, and practical difficulties are still a matter for later. This is also a very good example.</p>
<p>The theory of absolute equality has produced the so-called provisions for husband and wife to be each other's agents in the Civil Code, and the theory of absolute civil rights has created the article on the presumption of the head of the family—it is truly unprecedented. The author painstakingly maintains the principle that the family system should have its center of gravity and cannot remain silent on this. He says, "The presumption method greatly violates the spirit of the Chinese family... It is not known that the organization of the family is based on the relationship of grace and righteousness, unlike the organization of the state, which is threatened by power. Those whose grace and righteousness are exhausted can be separated; adults who are dissatisfied with the head of the family can also request separation. Since there is no legal provision to force them to form a family, why use the presumption method to ease the emotions of all parties? If the head of the family is actually stubborn and mischievous, their family members will avoid them, let alone use the presumption method to change the head of the family and live with them. Therefore, the principle of presuming the head of the family makes the original heads of families in society (those who are respected according to custom) feel uneasy, so as to shake the foundation of the family and violate the original intention of the law to maintain the family system..." (p. 420). This passage is very good. The question of who should have civil rights is important, and the method of election and presumption is very good, but anyone with a little common sense knows that it cannot be used in the family. The family is built on grace and righteousness, not on power. The state, which is built on power, has not awakened from its dream for more than twenty years. To this day, it still cannot adopt genuine elections or voting methods for the advancement and retreat of officials and the compliance of public opinion. How can one talk about implementing an election system in a family built on grace and righteousness! This is truly incomprehensible!</p>
<p>The current Civil Code places special emphasis on the obligations of the head of the family and does not stipulate any powers, not even the minimum power to maintain the peace and order of the family. Also, regarding family property, on the one hand, it formulates a system of property for husband and wife and allows the special property of minors, and on the other hand, it does not mention a word about the inherent system of family common property. The author believes that both of these are defects (p. 48-49) and are very detrimental to the center of gravity that the family should have. The generation of the head of the family places the primary emphasis on presumption. After the generation, he is not allowed to publicly have any power. He can’t even make a decision on the distribution and management of family property. A family like this, if they live together, can be said to be not even as good as an inn or an apartment. What is the use of it? The "family" that should have a center of gravity, according to the current Civil Code, will see the center of gravity gradually disappear until it cannot be maintained anymore. However, the "nation" that should be seeking a center of gravity in the same way has been constantly establishing a center of gravity for the past one or two decades, constantly implementing a policy of strengthening the "root" and weakening the "branches," completely forgetting that the roots and center of gravity of a democratic country are in the people, not in the government, in the local areas, not in the central government. Now, when we compare the family in the Civil Code with the actual country, we cannot help but feel a bit ridiculous.</p>
<p>3. The Dilemma of Civil Law Scholars</p>
<p>The problem of the family system has been going on for a long time. Sociologists and people concerned about social issues have been constantly discussing it. Civil law scholars, especially in the years when the Civil Code was being drafted, have also been discussing it very lively. However, it is easier for people outside of civil law to discuss it, and they can be less responsible. People who tend to be individualistic can thoroughly advocate small families, absolute freedom and equality between husband and wife, economic life, and other aspects of life. As for the details of the various relationships in the family, they can be put aside and not asked. It is easy to say ready-made theories, and it is difficult to solve practical problems. These friends are obviously taking a path of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial. As for the debaters who tend towards socialism, speaking seems even easier; the elderly go to nursing homes, children go to public nurseries, divorce is absolutely free, isn't there much reason for the family system to exist at all? I remember that someone wrote a specialized book on the family problem in those years, and the conclusion was to abolish the family. Once the family is completely wiped out, what problem is there? It was unprecedentedly decisive. (In recent years, these friends have seen that the Soviet Russian family still exists, the freedom of divorce is greatly restricted, and the childcare methods are limited to daytime only. At the same time, they have also formed families and become fathers, tasted some real joys and sorrows, and no longer make such decisive arguments.)</p>
<p>However, the position of civil law scholars is very different. It is not convenient for them to speak wishfully, and they cannot speak without thinking. They have to stipulate articles, write them down on white paper with black ink, word by word, and make them into a fixed law that people believe in and that can be passed down for a long time. On the one hand, they must take into account facts and experience, otherwise, having a law is equal to not having a law. It is either difficult to implement or a mere formality. On the other hand, they cannot but add some theories and ideals, otherwise, wouldn't they deny the leading function of the law, and ridicule themselves for being conservative, backward, and even reactionary? So our legal scholars who are responsible for legislation are in trouble. And even more unfortunately, the facts and experience of China's family system are like a large rock in the heart of the river, which is the most stubborn. The theories and ideals involving the family system at the moment are like a torrent in the river, which is the most turbulent. And those who are caught in the middle are none other than our civil law scholars. The reviewer has analyzed the awkward situation of their being in a dilemma and unable to move forward or backward when the law was drafted.</p>
<p>In fact, this dilemma can be avoided. Why didn't legislators consult with more cautious and down-to-earth sociologists and anthropologists before legislating? The first step is to have a more accurate analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the past family system. The second step is to put in the same effort for the Western family system. The third step is to propose a revised plan based on the principle of promoting advantages and eliminating disadvantages. The basic principle of this plan should be to transform the inherent deformed development into normal development, and the so-called normal refers to making family life a great help to personal life and social life, and no longer a great obstacle. After everyone agrees on such a plan to revise the family system, then take the fourth step, which is the formulation of the kinship law.</p>
<h3 id="e152">New Theories on Sex Education <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Zhi</p>
<p>Author: Buschke, Jacob</p>
<p>Translator: Dong Qiushi</p>
<p>Publisher: Shenghuo Bookstore</p>
<p>In real life, there is sometimes a necessary need for some beneficial and interesting reading material. Whether you are a working youth or a student, you will have this feeling, right? Well, now I would like to introduce a book to you all - *New Theories on Sex Education*.</p>
<p>This book was originally written by Dr. Buschke and Dr. Jacob, two German medical doctors. It was translated into English by Mr. and Mrs. Eden, and then translated into Chinese by Dong Qiushi from the English version. The original authors are famous German medical doctors, and the English translators have worked on the new translation of "Das Kapital", which shows that this book is very valuable.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many sexology translations or works on the market at present, but after reading them, you can know that they are some hackneyed tunes, not works that seek to profit from erotic temptation, or their starting point is very incorrect, containing fantasy and exaggeration. After reading them, there will inevitably be various abuses, indulgence, and even self-destruction; so now I specially present this "New Theories on Sex Education" to discuss with you.</p>
<p>This book has an educational flavor. The first few chapters explain the anatomy of the male and female reproductive organs, the middle section explains the onset of spring love and sexual impulses, and finally it describes the origin of venereal diseases, personal prevention methods, and eugenics and hygiene. The ending is marriage guidance.</p>
<p>After reading this book, you will feel that you can gain some knowledge because it has a concise description of all departments of sexology and is accompanied by illustrations. It tells us many issues of benefit and harm, and supports monogamy. It says:</p>
<p>"We believe that the only correct path is to consistently move towards pure monogamy... A pure marriage is a common relationship established by a selfish male and a selfish female based on mutual attraction. After the close combination of the selfishness of both men and women, both parties do not regard selfishness as unique, because both parties regard it as a common selfishness... Seeking pleasure outside of marriage is not to destroy marriage, but to destroy the bonds of love..."</p>
<p>Indeed, monogamy is a good method, which is not only beneficial to the individual but also beneficial to society and the country. Its instructions should be implemented.</p>
<p>In short, it is a beneficial reading material. As the author said:</p>
<p>"History teaches us that after major wars and economic turmoil, during that transition period, decadent phenomena are particularly likely to be manifested in the field of sexual life."</p>
<p>Now, it is this transition time. I hope you will read it patiently!</p>
<h3 id="e153">This Era <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Juyu</p>
<p>By Luo Hong, a collection of short stories published by Zhengyan Publishing House</p>
<p>"This Era" includes eight short stories. The earliest was written in the 27th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1938], and the latest in the 33rd year [i.e., 1944], spanning five or six years. But these five or six years were all during the War of Resistance, so all eight short stories use the War of Resistance as their background. The War of Resistance caused extraordinary changes in the entire society. Those who were originally well-fed and clothed are now bankrupt; those who originally lived a peaceful life are now wandering; conversely, those who were originally destitute have seized the opportunity to climb up; those who were originally hoodlums and rascals have long developed into enemy running dogs and accomplices. The vicissitudes of the world are no greater than this, and the upward or downward trend of people's hearts has not changed faster, been expressed more clearly, or been more profound than at this time. What the novel wants to write and portray is people. Even so-called War of Resistance novels, apart from meaning the depiction of people during the War of Resistance, I really can't think of any other way to write them. Since no one can transcend the War of Resistance during the War of Resistance, writing about various people also reflects the various roles in the War of Resistance. The background of "This Era" is the War of Resistance, and what is written is people, but they are not extraordinary people, but ordinary people who are most often encountered in society, and therefore it also reflects the most realistic society in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>"This Era" is very realistic. There are no tortuous stories or bizarre plots. Since the author focuses on portraying people, she only needs to let her characters reveal their inner thoughts and actions in the most unsurprising and ordinary things. The more unsurprising it is, the more intimate and closer we feel. Really, there are many people in this society like Wang Ba, Master Li Si (Wang Boyan and Master Li Si), Master Li San (Neighbors), Xu Zhaozhang (Friendship), and so on. Perhaps they are not like that on the surface, but they are all like that in their hearts.</p>
<p>The author herself said that she "often likes to write about" Wang Ba, "Master Li Si," and "that old protagonist in 'Neighbors'" (Postscript). These kinds of people are redundant people in society. On the one hand, they are pitiful; on the other hand, they are laughable. For example, Wang Ba is a ruined household, "lonely and helpless, even scolding people is disadvantageous." He scolds people "Wang Ba," but as a result, one mouth cannot defeat the mouths of the crowd, and he himself is instead branded as "Wang Ba." Such a big world, and only one Master Li Si calls his name. Master Li San in "Neighbors" is also a similar figure. His family property was destroyed by the war, so he had to rent out his house to scoundrels and rogues. Thinking of his own decline, he deeply hates the shameless fortune of his neighbors, and even opposes them using donations to enrich their own pockets. But in order to save face, he is willing to be blackmailed and reluctantly take out donations. This kind of muddled action is extremely human.</p>
<p>In another novel, "Snowy Night," the author writes about another typical old person, a bookworm who is obsessed with antiquity. But the war made him poor, forcing him to face the reality of life, causing him to produce intense love and hate. So he helps his nephew, who is a guerrilla, rescue comrades who were in distress during the War of Resistance, and righteously condemns his younger brother, who is a traitor to the country, displaying the true spirit of Confucianism. Although the author claims that the novel "Snowy Night" focuses on writing about young people, what she writes particularly well is this old man who can love and hate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the author writes about intellectuals in the city. In "This Era," she writes about a mother who was very progressive in the May Fourth Movement but is now so conservative that she wants to keep her daughter by her side for the rest of her life. In "Demon," she writes about a wealthy woman who uses play to numb herself every day, but in reality, she has "a kind of inexplicable annoyance, a kind of rootless emptiness that often strikes her heart, and will climb to her heart for no reason" (page 160), endless emptiness, no love, no joy in life.</p>
<p>Since the author adopts ordinary stories to portray people's psychology, then this psychology must be portrayed deeply, which is necessary.</p>
<p>"This Era" is very good at grasping some realistic subjects to portray people, but in terms of depth, it is not enough. There is no obvious difference in personality between Wang Ba, Master Li Si, and Master Li San. The young man in "Snowy Night" is abstract. "Friendship" wants to talk about the snobbery after people get rich, but the people written about are too flat, and the result is only that people read a story. On the other hand, the mother in "This Era" and the wife in "Demon" who feels empty are sympathetic and understandable.</p>
<p>What is called deep portrayal? I think it is nothing more than human touch. There are no purely bad people, and no purely good people. We should extract a person's psychology from contradictions, carefully dissect him, carefully summarize him, and at the same time use the most suitable story to appropriately express these psychologies. The story is ordinary, but the consciousness is profound. Ordinary but profound requires the effort of genius. "This Era" has enlightened me on this point.</p>

<p>— He Fu</p>
<p>It was the early summer season, and due to daylight saving time, it was only nine o'clock in the evening, and the sky was already dim. Night began to envelop this gray and filthy alley. At this time, the electric lights of all sizes in the left and right neighborhoods began to emit light of varying intensity, one after another. Our five electric light bulbs also turned on almost simultaneously. My wife, child, and I had nothing to do after dinner, so we handed our tired bodies over to the worn-out bed.</p>
<p>On this bed, we used the events of the whole day, both small, like the family's livelihood, and trivial household matters, and large, like the country and society, as good material for conversation. We poor people always talk about food first. The rise and fall of rice prices are closely related to our survival. Not long ago, the price of rice suddenly jumped to seven thousand, and our humble dwelling reduced its meals from one porridge and one meal to thin porridge twice a day, and we were still uneasy all day long. Fortunately, in recent days, the price has gradually decreased, which is truly a great blessing from heaven. The tense hearts of the people have been slightly calmed. My wife said:</p>
<p>"The price of rice has fallen a bit today, and it continues to decline, which is always a good thing."</p>
<p>"Of course! Our hope is that after the price goes down, it won't skyrocket again. Because experience tells people that the past rice prices have gone through several periods of soaring and small rebounds before reaching the current market price." I replied.</p>
<p>"I hope that after this decline, the authorities can take further steps to eliminate this unreasonable price increase. It would be a truly virtuous act."</p>
<p>"Yes! The authorities are now acting swiftly and resolutely to eliminate hoarding and suppress rice prices. I believe that as long as they are determined and truly feel the life-and-death problems of the people, everything can be solved."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>Next door was a leather shoe workshop, and the factory was buzzing with activity! The sound of hammering lasts, sewing machines, and chatting blended together. The old foreman hummed various tunes, including Beijing opera. They sang from: "The first month... is coming... it's the new spring..." to "Three lifetimes... of... fortune." Although the tune seemed a bit rough, they seemed free and happy, full of interest.</p>
<p>Our conversation turned to this side, and my wife said:</p>
<p>"It seems that those craftsmen live a more enjoyable life than ordinary people."</p>
<p>"However, they naturally have their own hardships. You and I are outsiders, so we are somewhat estranged!" I objected.</p>
<p>"As long as they have money in their hands, it doesn't matter if it's a bit harder. Only those who suffer endlessly but still can't fill their stomachs are the most miserable!" She stated emphatically to me.</p>
<p>"However, I think they get up early in the morning and work until late at night, and their income is quite meager!" I asked her gently.</p>
<p>She smiled and then shook her head, saying:</p>
<p>"Your estimate is wrong! The reality is absolutely the opposite. People just spend four or five thousand on cigarettes, alcohol, and snacks every day and still don't think it's enough! Not to mention supporting their families and letting everyone eat comfortably. You have to think about people like that A Gen; he has a wife and children in his hometown, and a mistress in Shanghai, running two households. He also likes to eat, dress, and enjoy himself! He has two apprentices under him, who learn the trade for three years. They learn in the first year and assist the master for more than two years. They eat bitter food and get a small monthly allowance. Other than that, the livelihood and wages they earn are all the master's. If they don't do well or are lazy, they will be whipped! A Gen foreman has six hands helping him make money. It is common for him to earn forty or fifty thousand a day." She paused slightly and continued, "Even ordinary foremen who don't take apprentices and rely on their own work to earn two thousand a day is not uncommon!"</p>
<p>I, with a surprised look, constantly shook my head to express disbelief! However, she had facts to persuade me:</p>
<p>"A Gen foreman's ups and downs in each mahjong game are always close to ten thousand, this is the first. A Gen's wife and his mistress have gold bracelets on their thick arms and gold rings on their fingers, which have been accumulating, this is the second. A Gen recently bought more than ten acres of good farmland in his hometown, which he personally told people, this is the third. Based on these three points, you can know how much A Gen earns every day!"</p>
<p>I have also heard these things from neighbors. Over the years, due to the high rise in prices and the constant increase in wages, A Gen foreman has been full of smiles all day long. He is truly said to be happy and content. Indeed, he has recently become even fatter than before, and his clothes are also better than before! Yes, I should admit it!</p>
<p>I was silent. I began to feel ashamed, ashamed of myself for being so useless! I began to regret why I had read so many useless books? My grandfather's teachings floated in my mind:</p>
<p>"Children! You are still young. Reading a lot of books will not necessarily earn you food. Children should be apprentices and learn a craft. A craftsman will not starve to death in a famine! It's good to eat well without knowing how to read, but it's not good to be without a craft!..."</p>
<p>The facts are before my eyes, and the old people's words are correct.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if I had followed my grandfather's words when I was young, whether I had followed a carpenter, coppersmith, bricklayer, or shoemaker! Even if it was a bit harder, just three years of apprenticeship would not have burdened me to this day? However, in this society, there are countless people who are full without fortune and have a share in starvation! Like me, I am just one in ten million.</p>
<p>The child snuggled in her mother's arms, sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>"Wen'er is already two years old! So lively, so innocent! She doesn't know the immensity of the sky and the earth; the ways of the world and human feelings, her parents' bitterness. When she sees people eating meat, her little mouth often hums: "Meat, meat"! In fact, God knows; her parents really feel sorry for her! We coax her every day: "Buy it tomorrow," "Mommy will buy it tomorrow"! She responds with "Oh, oh," which is so pitiful! As for when we can spend thousands of dollars to buy a pound of meat for everyone to eat, I really have no confidence and dare not think about it." My wife said sadly, seemingly with endless bitterness.</p>
<p>I hesitated for a while and slowly said, "I always hope that fate, our fate, will one day turn for the better, and all the problems that cannot be solved will naturally be solved..." But in reality, I often think of our fate, this tragic fate that is suffocating, which has been going on for nine whole years. In these long years, what day has been a good day of peace? It is said that the country's final victory has long come. We ordinary people never want any luxurious enjoyment in life. We only ask that the country be truly peaceful; everything can proceed on the path of reconstruction calmly. Coarse vegetables and white rice, a peaceful life, being able to live a lifetime is enough to be satisfied. But, but the affairs of the world are always difficult to fulfill people's wishes! Opening my eyes; it's such a chaotic world! It's so terrifying, so terrifying!... What will happen in the future? Who dares to imagine?... I have many things to say in my mind, but I can't say them, and I remain silent.</p>
<p>The night was deep. I pushed open the window, the sky was pitch black, and the sound of people gradually quieted down. The evening breeze blew in, still carrying the coolness of late spring. My mood was uneasy and I found it difficult to sleep peacefully...</p>
<p>Suddenly, a series of clamorous noises came from next door. I pricked up my ears and listened carefully:</p>
<p>"Mommy, Mommy!" It was a female voice, Zhao Di's voice.</p>
<p>"Auntie, Auntie!" Mao Ying from the front building was shouting madly!</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law, sister-in-law! What's wrong with you!" A mournful cry.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mommy, Mommy, Mom...my..."</p>
<p>"Auntie! You...you...you wake up! Wake up!"</p>
<p>Immediately after a commotion, there was a painful cry:</p>
<p>"Zhao Di's mother! How could you...bear...to leave your children...and go alone...ah!" Continuing to sob.</p>
<p>"Mommy! When...will you be able...to come back to life...ah?" The tone was so sad.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Someone instructed, "There's nothing anyone can do! Everyone doesn't need to cry anymore! We should hurry and prepare for the funeral."</p>
<p>Then, the sound of chaotic leather shoes, moving tables, and moving beds lasted for a while.</p>
<p>My nerves were tense, my head was dizzy, and my hands and feet were ice-cold. I started to tremble. It was like I had just woken up from a nightmare. "Alas! Poor Zhao Di's mother—that kind and amiable middle-aged woman who had been suffering from lung disease for more than half a year. She died, dragged away alive by the demons of poverty and disease." I said to myself, containing my grief and holding back my tears.</p>
<p>My wife was extremely tired! She had fallen asleep peacefully. She was not awakened by the noisy crying. Let her sleep peacefully! There are still things to do tomorrow. My sister-in-law from the front building, with her eyes wide open and swollen from crying, pushed open the door and sat on the edge of my bed. I advised her not to be too sad! People who die cannot be resurrected. It's no use being sad again! Sit here and rest!</p>
<p>I asked her all sorts of questions. She was Zhao Di's best friend. She was very enthusiastic, and Zhao Di's mother's affairs could not be hidden from her. I appreciated her feelings, and she told me a part of Zhao Di's mother's story in detail. The following is her conversation:</p>
<p>"Uncle Wen! To tell you the truth, Zhao Di's mother is pitiful! She died unjustly...</p>
<p>"Last year, in June or July: the situation was not yet peaceful. At that time, Shanghai was heavily bombed. A bomb fell in Hongkou. She was working in a yarn factory at that time. Fortunately, she wasn't killed. She crawled out of the pile of ashes. Her life was saved! Later... Since that day in August, when Shanghai was celebrating with firecrackers, China had won, and the world was at peace! Zhao Di's mother was so happy that she shed many tears. Then, unexpectedly, within a month, her factory stopped work, and Zhao Di's mother returned home to sit and eat. At the same time, her husband was also dismissed by the company! The couple broke their rice bowls. She was worried and anxious, and her already weak body developed the root of the disease. Zhao Di's father did small business, but his luck was not good. He lost all his capital, and to add insult to injury, he was arrested by the police. He was heartbroken after being released and left his wife and children, not knowing where he went! It's been more than six months with no news. Zhao Di saw her parents suffering and could not think of a way. She went to people's stores to collect clothes to wash, but the money she earned was not enough to eat, let alone pay for her mother's illness. Her mother didn't want to spend her daughter's hard-earned money on herself. She thought that she would get better if she endured it, but unexpectedly today... Alas! Pitiful, sinful! Sob! Sob!" She said to this point and couldn't help but start crying again!</p>
<p>"Don't cry! Your own health is also important. So, what now? How will Zhao Di's mother's funeral be taken care of?" I took a long breath and asked her, comforting her.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law from the front building wiped away her tears and then wiped her nose to suppress her painful crying:</p>
<p>"What relatives are there to take care of it for her? I'm a poor ghost myself, and every day is like New Year's Eve. I worry day and night! I can't worry until dawn. Tomorrow, I can only ask Zhao Di to borrow some money from her relatives. We all rely on the heavens for food. We should do some good deeds and contribute a little bit. Let Zhao Di's mother have a thin coffin."</p>
<p>I nodded, without any better words to reply to the sister-in-law from the front building. A burst of flashes and disorder came before my eyes, and I couldn't help but feel sorrow from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>"What! Uncle Wen, you're crying too!"</p>
<p>"No, I'm not crying! I won't cry." I forcibly suppressed my emotions and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>The clock chimed... chimed... loudly! It was twelve o'clock. The sister-in-law from the front building said goodbye to me. She was going next door to accompany Uncle. I watched her leave the room.</p>
<p>"When a person dies, everything is over! In reality, for people like us whose lives are worse than grass, living in this place at this time; living seems to be superfluous!... Originally, people living in the world, life and death are the most ordinary things. Especially for us mediocre, dirt-poor people, living is suffering, living is a sin! It's better to die peacefully, die cleanly?... Closing your eyes and mouth, everything is over!... I fell into a vortex of contemplation, dazed and confused.</p>
<p>"Zhao Di's mother is resting in peace forever! Thousands of 'Zhao Di's mothers' are following Zhao Di's mother's path...."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I was extremely tired! I closed my eyes and wanted to sleep quietly. However, the bloodsuckers (bed bugs) seemed to have immediately issued a "command" for an attack! Those hateful little animals emerged one after another from the decayed corners of the walls, cracks in the bricks, and the floorboards. At first, my arms were attacked first! Before I knew it, all parts of my body were being painfully bitten. I couldn't help but get up to search for them. The child's little hands frantically scratched at his calves, creating countless welts. It was so pitiful! It was hateful that these little animals sucked people's blood and slipped away, ran away! Those who were greedy and ate too much and couldn't escape the "tiger's mouth" were easily captured and killed on the spot! After death, a foul smell rushed straight into the nasal cavity. Once a bed bug was sucked into the mouth, it immediately turned into stinky blood, and the foul smell made people nauseous. We really turned pale at the mention of bed bugs. We couldn't catch them all, kill them all. They came and went, went and came! In an endless stream. Poor people are the most unfortunate. They don't have good food or clothes, and they suffer from "anemia." But bed bugs always "attack" patients with "anemia." I wanted to move to another house, but I didn't have any gold bars in my hand. I wanted to buy DDT, but the price was so expensive! Using "anemia" to feed bed bugs seemed like a destiny ordained for poor people. There was no way to avoid it.</p>
<p>There was the sound of a door opening outside. "Who is it?" I heard the landlady ask loudly.</p>
<p>"It's me!" A clear female voice replied.</p>
<p>"Mei Zhen is it?"</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>"You're home!" Then she said, "How was it today?"</p>
<p>"It was alright! I earned six blocks of "Gold" from those two rotten sailors!"</p>
<p>"Good, good! Go to sleep early! It's not early anymore!" Continuing, "See you tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"See you tomorrow!" I heard Mei Zhen say goodbye to the landlady, then fumbled and walked up the stairs step by step; her leather shoes rubbed on the steps, and the surrounding walls and louvers rattled.</p>
<p>After the door closed, Mei Zhen's mother talked to her daughter.</p>
<p>"Zhen Zhen! You came home late today, you must be tired!" Her mother's tone was diligent and considerate. "Don't sit there and think wildly! Go to bed and sleep comfortably!"</p>
<p>"Mommy, I...I'm suffering... suffering!" Mei Zhen seemed to suddenly speak with a trembling, bitter tone.</p>
<p>"Why? What's the matter that makes you feel sad? Zhen'er! Don't cry, tell your mother, tell me what happened today?!" Her mother asked haltingly.</p>
<p>"Tell! Tell you...what use is it? What use!" Her daughter sobbed.</p>
<p>"Then, then you can't not tell your mother! Zhen'er! Don't cry! Tell Mommy, tell Mommy!" Her mother pressed.</p>
<p>I held my breath and listened carefully to Mei Zhen's sad story to her mother:</p>
<p>"Mommy! Today, I was unlucky. Two murderous, lecherous ghosts! Two shameless sailors, drunk in the company, abused me like crazy!" Her voice gradually lowered, "They touched me from top to bottom, bottom to top...I...I didn't dare to get angry with them for a few blocks of "Gold." I wanted to be strong, but I was never stronger than them. I had no choice but to endure in every way, swallowing my tears! Later, I still served them diligently. Unexpectedly...unexpectedly they took me to a rickshaw, saying they were going to a room! I was scared, I didn't want to! They said ten "Gold" could knock me down. I was so anxious. After I got six "Gold" as "hospitality" fee, I wanted to sneak out the back door. But our manager...boo...hoo...hoo!" She cried again.</p>
<p>"What did the manager say?" Her mother asked again.</p>
<p>"The manager...he said I didn't know how to deal with customers! He said: If every bar girl was like this, his company would close down early! You're not a beautiful Xi Shi, a Chang'e in the moon, untouchable. If you want to be a lady, go home! We don't need you here...I was so angry that I cried my heart out. Sister Jin Mei felt sorry for me and sent me out of the back door of the ×× bar...boo...hoo..." She continued crying, "On the way, I ran into three shady guys in Western clothes, chattering behind my back, saying some shameless vulgar things. They followed me, getting closer and closer. I panicked! I turned my head and said a few words to them. They cursed at me: Old goods! Old goods from the ××! Selling ×× goods, go look in the mirror! Specially eating foreign ××! Who wants to stalk you, their eyes are blind!... I, I saw them leave, then staggered all the way home..." She cried even more sadly.</p>
<p>"Zhen'er, stop crying! People want to sleep, don't wake up the neighbors! It's embarrassing." Then, "Alas! It's all thanks to your father, we didn't cultivate in our past life so we suffer in this one! What else is there to say." Her mother sighed with infinite emotion!</p>
<p>The mother and daughter talked softly about some private matters. What were they saying? I couldn't hear clearly! Before long, the lights in her room went out, and it was quiet!</p>
<p>I knew Mei Zhen's family very well. Her house and mine were only separated by a wall that was dirty, black, and full of cobwebs. Her father was also an upright and honest man before the war. He died in the year of the war! Leaving behind his wife and several unfortunate daughters. Her eldest brother was later motivated by patriotism and went to the interior. There is still no news to this day. Perhaps he lost his life for the country, or perhaps he is still wandering at the ends of the world, unable to return home! Her family has pawned everything they had over the years! Filling other people's stomachs. Her mother had no choice but to let her eldest sister earn bread for the family with her beauty in the dance hall. Unfortunately, her eldest sister also died later! According to the calendar, it has been almost two years. Her eldest sister died of syphilis. After her eldest sister died; her mother had sworn an oath to the heavens! She didn't want to see her second daughter follow in her footsteps. She hoped that her second daughter would slowly find a partner and have a good, lifelong home.</p>
<p>But now ah, now she is: The entrance is flying both Chinese and American national flags, and the neon lights of various colors illuminate the women underneath them—bar girls!</p>
<p>This was after the victory...</p>
<p>This was after the first National Day celebration after the whole city celebrated victory...</p>
<p>Her age was only nineteen!....</p>
<p>The night was getting deeper! I still couldn't sleep peacefully. I was afraid, I was really afraid of being tormented by these things again. But I closed my eyes. My mind was still not quiet, and a sharp squeaking sound of rats scurrying around pierced my ears. I opened my tired eyes again; three or five rats were chasing and jumping around on the beams in groups. Holes had been made in the walls, which were heavily stained with grease, and the rats came and went freely. From the front building to the back building; from the back building to the attic, they gnawed on the utensils and food. During the day, they hid without a trace, but every night, they became rampant at the same time! I tried to catch them, but their movements were faster than mine, and their senses were more sensitive than mine. They also had sharp teeth, which made me feel cold and dare not attack! When I chased them fiercely, they hid for a while, but as soon as the lights went out, they became active again!</p>
<p>Because of these rats running rampant everywhere, I had discussed countermeasures with my neighbors and decided to:</p>
<p>"Eight households will raise a cat together, specializing in catching rats at night!"</p>
<p>But the result was that the cat was afraid of the rats, and our plan was declared a failure! Therefore, without any other way to think of, we had to endure all kinds of pain and continue in a perfunctory manner under the smoky atmosphere and the rats' arrogance.</p>
<p>I vaguely heard the giant clock of the Jianghai Customs ringing. It was four o'clock. There were footsteps "stumbling" and "clattering" at the door.</p>
<p>"Pancakes and fried dough sticks, do you want them! Pancakes and fried dough sticks!..."</p>
<p>"Hurry up and go! It's late, there won't be anything good left at the market..."</p>
<p>"The sky is about to dawn! The stalls haven't been set up yet, how can we make it in time..."</p>
<p>The vendors started rushing to the "early market."</p>
<p>Looking out the window; the sky was beginning to show a glimmer of dawn, although it was about to dawn, it was not yet light!</p>
<p>This whole night was spent like this. If I said this was an unusual night, perhaps it was quite ordinary. If I said it was ordinary, then perhaps it was not ordinary at all.</p>
<p>Insomnia is a painful thing, but writing down so many painful things makes my heart especially painful and uncomfortable!....</p>

<p>— Zhang Che</p>
<p>(1) Poplar</p>
<p>In the slow-coming spring of the north, the poplar is the first to reveal the news of spring. In the monotonous yellow earth plains of the north, the poplar is the only one that stands tall above the ordinary yellow-gray.</p>
<p>It is straight, never stooping to beg for pity from the wind and rain; it is tall, towering far above all the dull scenery. It is useful, being the most commonly used wood by the masses in the Northwest; it is green, and when the Yellow River is still locked under ice and snow, new buds have already struggled to break through at the treetops.</p>
<p>Strolling on the yellow earth fields, the rows of poplars in the distance resemble a patch of brownish-green morning mist. This is the most vibrant color on the earth! I praise the poplar because of its upright and unyielding spirit, because it is the first to bring the sound of spring's footsteps.</p>
<p>(2) Sparrow</p>
<p>When getting up in the morning, one doesn't know what clothes to wear to cope with the changeable climate of the Northwest; but when one hears the joyful and energetic chirping of sparrows, one knows that there will be good weather today.</p>
<p>The sparrow is a messenger, a happy messenger of the sun. Hearing its chirping, as one puts on clothes in bed, it makes one imagine the tall and vast skies; the hair-like light white clouds, the moist and warm breeze, the bright sunshine. And when, in response to its call, one goes outdoors, one can smell the fragrance of spring and receive the golden arrows of the sun.</p>
<p>I love the sparrow, like a prophet of all beautiful things.</p>
<p>(3) Doves and Kites</p>
<p>People who are tired of the road of life are unwilling to look up at the sky; people who are busy on the road of life have no time to look up at the sky; but spring is spring after all, and we have doves and kites.</p>
<p>Doves can have whistles on their feet, and kites can have bows. They will resonate with a distant and clear sound above people's heads, prompting you to look up at the beautiful sky.</p>
<p>I thank the doves and kites because they give people a little dream and lofty interest.</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>The wilderness, inlaid with silver and carved with jade, is so quiet that people and animals have disappeared, not even a single bird can be seen. The snow covers everything, and not a single branch or fallen leaf can be seen on the ground. The footprints of Little Hong quickly fill up as she walks. Little Hong gropes her way to the small forest where she regularly gathers firewood, using a flat stick to shake and sift through the snow on the ground, searching for her target. But alas! After searching for a long time, she still hasn't gathered enough for a bundle. Little Hong is anxious! How will she go back and report? This bit of wet firewood, including the water content, doesn't even weigh ten pounds, but the landlady requires her to gather at least thirty pounds every day, and she is still far short! Moreover, looking at the sky, it's about to get dark, Little Hong's hands and feet are already numb with cold, and she's shivering all over! Helplessly, she has to carry the bundle of wet firewood on her back and head home. At this time, the wind is stronger and the snowflakes are denser. There are few pedestrians on the road, and Little Hong struggles to move forward. The black cloth on her head has turned into a white helmet, and she is wearing a pearl-furred sheepskin coat inside out. Thinking of her miserable life, Little Hong is heartbroken! Tears and snot mixed with the air she breathes, freeze into ice!</p>
<p>"Oh God! Open your eyes, please warm up the weather, if this goes on, I won't be able to live!"</p>
<p>Little Hong prays, sobbing! She has never felt so desperate as today! She thinks about how she won't get enough to eat even if she goes back to her own home, she thinks about how Liao Dong is still young and will need several more years to become an adult; and she thinks about how Liao Dong ignores her, perhaps because he doesn't like her; so even if she waits for him to grow up and get married, she will still be unhappy; therefore, she is beginning to feel impatient with life! She blames her parents for not being able to support her, why didn't they cure her to death earlier? Since they had to give her to someone else to raise, why didn't they find a good family? She shivers in fear whenever she hears the landlady's voice; and she is as scared as if she had seen King Yama when she sees the landlady, and her whole body breaks out in goosebumps. As she nears the Hall of Returning Spring, she gazes at her own home across the street. She wishes she could run back and cry to her parents, but she is afraid of making them sad, she can't let her parents suffer for her pain anymore! So she grits her teeth and still walks back to the Hall of Returning Spring.</p>
<p>Bao Ling is idle at the counter, rubbing his hands because he's cold. He catches sight of Little Hong returning and hurriedly runs over to help her unload the wet firewood from her back, and takes it to the kitchen in the back. This makes Little Hong very grateful! She often thinks: If Liao Dong were so considerate of her and helped her! She would be willing to endure even more hardship! But no, Liao Dong has no affection for her at all, he doesn't have it now, and he won't have it in the future! But why? Why is he like this? Has she offended him in any way? Does he think she isn't working hard enough in this family? She doesn't understand, she must find a chance to ask him, she can't die still confused! She makes up her mind.</p>
<p>"It's getting late, I'll help you cook dinner," Bao Ling says, starting a fire in the stove for Little Hong and filling the pot with water.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Brother Bao Ling, please fill the pot with more water. Once it's boiled, I want a basin to wash my feet, and then you can put the rice in to cook," Little Hong says.</p>
<p>"Little Hong wants a basin of hot water to warm her feet, she's really freezing! She takes off the black cloth on her head and sits in front of the stove, warming herself by the fire. The ice turns into water when it meets the heat, and her clothes are all soaked."</p>
<p>"I gathered so little firewood today, I'm afraid I'll be scolded again later," Little Hong says timidly.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have gone out on such a snowy day in the first place. If she says it's too little, let her go and gather some herself," Bao Ling says angrily. "One can't be too unreasonable."</p>
