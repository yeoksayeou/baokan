<h3 id="c3">邵力子發表意見　憲草必須符合五權憲法　各黨各派均希捐棄成見 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕國大第九决大會上午舉行大會，茲誌各代表發言如决：</p>
<p>姚勤如：此一憲草根據各方意見修訂而成，可謂煞費苦心，惟其中對人民福利有關者仍嫌簡略，尤對經濟，敎育兩點未能充分列舉，計全部憲草有關經濟者僅五條，有關敎育者僅三條，實不免有掛一漏萬之弊。本人認爲經濟制度發展，敎育目標制度發展，以及救濟失學靑年與兒童等，均應於憲法中包括之。國父曾云：建設之首要在國計民生，如敎育不修，罔談民生，故基本國策對於經濟，敎育應另行專章詳細規定，才能使國家長治久安以達富强康樂之境。</p>
<p>林立：諸代表對軍隊國家化，政治民主化兩點，甚少表示意見，本人頃即就基本國策方面略抒」二：所謂國防，亦即必須軍除國家化，本人主猥可略如下述：（一）軍民分治，業在一三四條內規定，（二）軍黨分立，（三）徴兵制度，（四）軍官任免應有保障，（五）目前係原子時代，應注意科學國防。</p>
<p>黄正淸：根據第一章第五條中華民國各民族一律平等之規定，所謂平等，自應包括權利與義務，使其機會均等，但憲草中對邊疆同胞之地位與權利仍未能廣泛包括，殊爲遺憾。其中所載西藏通常係指後藏，其實川，靑，康各省亦有藏族人口總數在四百萬以上彼等在文化經濟信仰習慣上，自成類型，但憲草中對此散居西藏外之邊民，並未明確規定，而所謂西藏地方之內，又不能與各該屬省內之其他民族相競爭，故如憲草中不能明確規定其應選之國大代表，則彼等之權利自將被剝奪無疑。孫中山先生在建國大綱中說：「對於國內各小民族當扶植之，使之能自決自治。」基於以上理由，吾人實不能使佔有國內如此廣大地區之藏族人民應事之權利，竟被忽視，並盼憲法中無此缺點。</p>
<p>伍純武：一部完美的憲法，必須規定人民有關的福利規章，吾人試觀當前社會有兩種現象：（一）貪汚的普遍，（二）物價不斷的飛漲，本人認爲其原因在於私有財產沒有限制，國家財產日趨萎頓，私人則普遍貧汚，故本人認爲必須限制私人財產，國家始可切切實實施行節制資本平均地權。</p>
<p>李宗黄：在本憲草內對省縣制度一章，本人認爲省的權力太高，縣的權力降低了，應予補救，其方法可規定，縣市自治單位，以縣爲自治主體，反之，即省不是自治單位，亦非自治主體，此一規定，可以使國家政治穩定，憲法亦不致於落空。</p>
<p>邵力子：本人感想甚多，惟以時間限制是否可說完，尙不能定：</p>
<p>（一）本人主張擁護五權憲法之制度與精神，因此乃一基本原則，不可違背的。總理所說之五權憲法之精神在於權能劃分，人民所希望者爲萬能政府，但並非陡然可以達到，必須具備若干條件。美國是總統制，英國是內閣制，法國亦總統制，但與美國又有所不同，故同爲三權制度，互有差異，我們的憲法與三權自然不同。本人參加政協及憲草審議會，覺得總理主義之成功，即三民主義和五權憲法是不能分開的，在討論憲草過程中，諸位如有好的意見，亦可修改，但必須使其符合五權憲法。</p>
<p>（二）有許多代表強調人民的利益應在黨派之上，要知黨派並不在人民之外，本人代表國民黨說話，國民黨不但沒有離開人民，也沒有脫離人民範圍的。總理說：「爲民先鋒」，國民黨是做人民先鋒，當然不能脫離人民，其他黨派亦在人民範圍之內，亦應做人民的先鋒。我們尊重自己的黨，同時尊重其他黨派，希望大家捐棄成見，憲草內限制黨派部份愈多，愈不妥當，在政協開會時，即所有黨派放棄自己成見，爲人民的利益，希望這次討論憲草，無論各代表產生自何單位，亦能爲人民之意旨着想。</p>
<p>（三）基本國策章，對於外交一部份，本人絕對贊同，吾人所需要者爲獨立自主的外交，關於聯合國憲章一點，有人認爲必須删去，本人認爲不必要，因此乃美國已逝之羅斯福大總統崇高的理想，簽字者亦有我國領袖，吾人不必將其認爲係暫時的，吾人應擁護，且使世界其他各國亦擁護之。</p>
<p>（四）對於選舉，如果進行普選，未參加公職候選檢覈考試者，即不能參加。如根據我國之社會風尙，定將使甚多有德望者，因不願參加考試而放棄選舉及被選舉權，似此乃一種損失，且根據憲法，老試委員應由民選，各縣公職候選人，均未產生，則考試院又從何而來，故對此舉，惟有等待將來，並盼各代表鄭重考慮。</p>
<h3 id="c4">鼓部長在招待會宣布　國府政院即改組　各黨各派人士可望參加 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕中宣部彭部長，五日午後於中外記者招待會席上宣布，國府委會及政院均將於最近將來改組，可望有黨派領袖及無黨派人士參加。彭氏此項談話，係答復某記者所詢：「最近紛傳國民政府委員會及行政院均即將改組，請問已達何階段。各黨派參加吾」一問題者。此外，尙有其他重要答問如下：</p>
<p>問，大連，旅順軍事。政治情形如何？中國海軍是否擬開進旅順？國軍是否已入大連？部長可詳以見吿否？</p>
<p>答，最近各報報道國軍向大連前進及海軍開赴旅順等，均非事實。</p>
<p>問，岡村寗决現在何處？今日俘遣送已畢，彼是否仍爲政府服務？</p>
<p>答，岡村仍以聯絡員資格，繼續協助遣送朱遣完之日僑日俘，蓋目前中國境內尙有一部分日僑及留用日技術人員未曾遺完，而若千日本戰犯如有宣判無罪者，亦當遣還，中共區域尙有若干日俘。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日常〕國府改組問題，因現正忙於制憲，故一時尙未表面化，惟政府已在準備進行中。至民社黨參加政府問題，據其一貫表示，均以制憲爲首，參加政府爲决，目前並未變更。聞該黨領袖之一李大明，業於日前抵滬，不日可來京出席國大，政府自將邀其共商政府改組各事。蔣勻田於五日夜車赴滬，日內返京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕頃自可靠方面獲悉，新疆代表並無書面建議向政府提出，最近將來亦不致提出，外傳稱種，並不可信。</p>
<h3 id="c5">李宗仁在京休養　辭職說完全不確 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕國大女代表劉純一遺體，五日下午二時在中國殯儀館大殮，到代表數百人，蔣夫人親臨主祭，于右任等陪祭，夫人面現戚容，各女代表多哀泣者。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕國大代表資格審査委會，今下午八時半在大會堂第二休息室分十九組審査，由召集人張代表厲生報吿審査辦法三點：（一）凡未繳當選證書之代表，請秘書處通知補繳，（二）如當選證書遺失者，則應請其太單位代表二人爲之證明，（三）遴選代表及各黨派代表，則請選舉總事務所證明其資格。各組旋即開始審査歷兩小時始畢，結果發現尙有多數代表未續當選證書，分別通知促其補繳</p>
<h3 id="c8">「和平老人」大受歡迎　國大第九次會拾零 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 本報記者　張明</p>
<p>和平老人邵力子的座次是四五六號，一個很吉祥的號數，開會以來一直沉默，五日下午却輪到了機會，一走上合，下面就是掌聲不絕。</p>
<p>和平老人一開始先來一段引言說：「我的感想很多，恐怕受時間的限制，不知道能不能說得完，不敢保險」。但是終於是太長了，主席張繼老一再按鈴，不過手上按鈴是法令，臉上却一團笑，未嘗不是人情，於是和平老人再要求繼續說下去，並問：「好不好」，張老沒答覆，合下却聯珠砲似的鼓起掌來，而且呌好不絕。</p>
<p>孔庚老在某代表發言渦程中，跑上台去，側頭伏案作褂，過一會方知原來是昨晚因聽靑年黨，民社黨發言即時而作的詩，茲錄如决：「民社靑年口若河，靑年特別堂聲多，偉觀惟有權能論，國父遺言　國歌」，下署枕上偶感。</p>
<p>記者席太少，若干記者被擠無奈，只能坐到代表席决去，有人戲謂：「記者顯然比代表高一等，因爲記者被擠落了席决，方做代表。</p>
<p>某代表團一時離席，應該取到的文件沒有取到，大發脾氣，呌會塲幹事，殊不知幹事太少，不敷支配，某代表即時拍案責難，某幹事極有禮貌的說：「對不起，對不起」，幸而「案」不是公案，故拍而並不響。</p>
<p>爲了「停止廣泛討論」的問題，張　老用了迅雷不及掩耳的手法，立即付之表決，雖然有人大呼沒有聽到，但表決器上已經點點明星了。</p>
<p>某一代表沒有呌到他，就自行走上發言台，但是沒有發言，主席已在進行其他問題的處理，最後，他又沒得到命令，獨自走了下來，記者謂，此乃自主自治自覺也，自生的走上去，自治的不發言，自覺的走下台。</p>
<p>女代表劉純一死了，身爲女代表的蔣宋美齡也送了一個花圈。</p>
<p>「國大之后」的行動，有人爲之紀事，比如昨日頭髮梳油捲，今日梳油條，大衣開始穿白的，現在是黑的，而且頻頻研討她的言行舉動。代表特別費每人國幣五十萬，淸晨就發給，代表們趕先領取，全是嶄新的聯號票，有人問，逍個月的通貨又惡性了什麽程度。于鬍子到會尙早，請求　寳的極多，他也就書來極爲迅速，要求者有代表，有記者，有會塲幹事，得者皆大歡喜。</p>

<p>胡適五日午後於中宣部記者招待會席上，鄭重否認渠將出而組黨，並宣稱短期內亦不擬出版雜誌。胡氏對上述兩問題，木避不作答，後經提出該問題之記者再度催問，始稱：「我胡適之決不辦黨，諸位可以信得我的興趣現大部在非政治方面，換句話說，是在學術方面，我無意於辦黨，亦無工夫組黨」。至於「獨立評論」是否復刋，或是否將出版其他雜誌，胡之答復爲：九一八後曾糾集志同道合者十二人，籌集資金的五千元，辦一獨立評論，前後出版達五年，發表文稿千四百篇，從未付過分文稿費，誠可謂做到眞正「獨立」，惟在今日獨立已不容易，蓋此時撰稿之敎授已極淸苦，斗米升米皆所計較，小稿不給酬，勢不可能，加之目前紙費，印刋費咸極昂貴，經對各方作畏期考慮後，余殊無意創辦雜誌。</p>
<p>國大主席團胡適博士，五日午後應中宣部彭部長之請，公開招待中外記者，招待會係於公誼聯歡社陳樹人畫展展覽室舉行，若干參觀畫展男女，因仰慕胡氏名聲，竚足圍觀，均以一瞻胡氏豐采爲快。</p>
<p>胡氏於招待會上，首述其太人旅居華盛頓四年，惜無緣參加白宮每週舉行二次之記者招待會，因而未曾學得應付之「技巧」，今日乃以「硏究憲草學生之一」資格，與各記者見面。　（十二月五日）</p>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕國大主席團之一胡適，五日午後出席中宣部記者招待會，答復有關憲草及國大之各項問題，出語亦莊亦諧贏得二百餘中外記者不少笑聲，胡氏於彭部長作簡短介紹後，起立作謙虛之自我介紹，謂今日參加記者招待會，願就所知作答，惟以未參加政協及其後之憲草審議會，因之僅以研究憲法學生之資格答問，有人特別提及國府主席蔣先生於國大以憲草遞余一事，其實此僅爲歷史上之偶然事件，蓋是日適由余担任主席，實無何深重意議。胡答復問題時，謂國大最後對憲草將作何種決定，目下尙難定言，依渠個人看法，憲草大體可望通過，不致有何重大或根本的修改，觀於大會近日情緒，可知與會者咸反對任何統制或約束，蓋大會有權亦將更臻完善，惟若加以冷靜分析，即可知此一憲草大體尙爲合理與現代化，以其爲各黨各派與無黨派人士經長時期研討之結晶，故不致有何根本的變更。有詢大會廣泛討論時，若干代表認此一憲草係黨派憲草，而非人民的憲草，此說然否？胡謂，此問題可以邵力子先生今晨於國大之言諭作答，邵氏謂因爲此一憲草爲各黨各派所擬成，故不能說爲一黨一派之憲草，而爲眞正代表人民利益者，此點甚對。關於立監委爲國大代表一點，胡亦認二者最好不兼國大代表，並信此種規定將來可能删去。對於國都問題，胡認在此空中堡壘與原子彈時期，任何地點皆可作爲國都，亦皆不宜作爲國都，歷史看法已不復適用於今日。某記者詢以將來國大表決首都設於何處時，胡將贊成何處，胡氏手持憲草，以幽默語調答稱，根據一百廿八條之規定，投票以無記名方法行之，因之，余有權不吿知君等，語畢，衆皆笑不可仰。某記者提及有一部份代表認憲草中資太主義色彩過濃，胡不以爲然，指出基太國策間第一三八條至一四二條五條中，僅「一四一」條上半句「國家對於私人之財富及私人事業應保護之」可指此說，但其他四條半皆可謂爲社會主義思想，其實即共黨亦不否認保護私人財富之需要，故不能謂爲資本主義色彩過濃。關於大會日程，胡以爲延期至十二月十九日後如仍不能結束，可能再度延長，大會何時重開，須視審査情形而定，若有一二小組審査完畢，即可召開大會，渠信人民權利義務一章問題較少，經審査後或可即提出大會公決。至審査會將秘密舉行，記者不能參加一點，一方面固由於房屋過少，難以盡容，他方面亦由於如是。後與會者可專就條文詳細討論愼重攷慮，不致於爲博得旁聽者注意而互不相讓，並舉美國費城憲草會不公開之事爲例。</p>

<p>英國商業訪間代表團來華考察各地實際情形，忽已兩月，對於促進中英兩國的貿易，必大有貢獻；據本報昨日南京電，獲悉中英商的草案，業經英國駐華大使館提出，預料不久即可開始談判；全國人士對此，期望甚殷：咸以爲中英兩國關係，素稱密切，且在大戰期間，中英兩國駢肩作戰，爲反對侵略而共同奮鬥，雙方的友誼。經過這一番血的洗煉。益形鞏固。故在大戰結束之後，中國人民即盼望英國對待中國，一變其過去英帝國主義的作風，毅然以香港九龍歸還中國，以　補中英兩國人民間的裂痕，並將中英兩國外交史上的汚點洗刷乾淨。但是英國當局對此，至今未有明朗的表示，而其戀戀不舍的神情。顯而易見，使中國人民早已深致不滿。最近聞及中英開始商務談判的消息，莫不希望政府能在談判的過程中，提出收回香港九龍的要求，上海市議參會對於要求政府收回香港九龍，早港九龍的要求，上海市議參會對於要求政府收回香港九龍，早有決議，這幾天來一般民衆團體，亦紛紛致電外交當局，貢獻意見，甚至有主張應以收回香港九龍爲中英締結商約的先決條件者。</p>
<p>在此全國人民期望中英邦交展開新頁之際·忽又聞及英軍突自九龍侵人我國深圳，槍殺我國同胞，當塲　斃村民一人，政府雖已向香港當局提出强硬抗議，且已獲得香港警備司令的口頭道歉；但是英軍這種侵犯我國領土主權以及傷害我國人民生命之行爲，實在足以激起中國人民的憤怒，其影響所及，匪特影響今後的中英邦交，抑几對於即將開始進行的中英商約談判，亦將直接蒙受其不利的影響。英國外交家素以目光遠大見稱於世，對於有妨中英邦交的香港九龍，偏偏要抓住了，不肯放手，實在令人百思不解。</p>
<p>中國與各國從前所簽訂的不平等條約，以雅片戰爭之後的南京條約爲嗝矢，而香港的割讓與英國，即爲南京條約的產物，故我國廢除不平等條約，收回割讓地及租界地、應以收回香港爲始。民國三十二年一，中英間所有不平等條約，一律取消；但英國政府仍不肯將香港九能交還中國，中國人民早已深表不滿。就是各國的偉大政治外交家，也以英國採取這種態度爲不智。按在大戰期間，中英美三國巨頭在開羅會晤共商遠東的百年大計時，在原則上也曾一致同意，將香港九龍歸還中國。美國故總統羅斯福對此、允力持正義；可是到了戰爭結束之後，英國仍不肯放手，美國議員也曾爲了英國不肯放棄香港九龍而加以抨擊，英國當局迫不獲已，乃採取延宕政策，發表一個模稜兩可的聲明：「一俟時機成熟成當即與中國進行談判，討論香港歸還的問題。」因此香港九龍問題，也就成爲中英間的懸案。</p>
<p>英國朝野對於最近成立的中美商約。頗有煩言，並爲英國在華地位的日趨式極而深感焦慮，因此迫切希望中英商約能早日成立。他們的苦悶和焦慮、我們完全能够了解，而且表示同情；因爲戰後中國需要和平及繁榮，對待列强，不論是英，美，法，蘇任何一國，都不願加以歧視，或分　輊；而願在平等互惠的原則之下，分別與各國締結商約。但是我們也要使英國朝野明瞭我國對於香港九龍的民族願望，本報社論對於香港九龍問題，一再指出收回香港九龍，實爲我國人民共同一致的願望；英國如果不能　足我們的民族願望，則中英邦交上的汚點就不能洗刷乾淨，兩國外交關係的新頁，，更沒有翻開的希望。</p>
<p>舍政治上的理由而言經濟上的因素，英國也應該把香港九龍歸還中國。商訂中英商約的唯一目標，乃在促進中英兩國間的貿易，但是如何增加兩國貿易的數量？首在中國經濟的復興與繁榮。而香港地位特殊化，素爲我國經濟建設上的一大障礙，時至今日，猶爲走私漏稅以及逃避外匯的淵　，尤其是把香港列入國外航行的範圍之內，足使我國幼稚的航業永無抬頭的一天。所以英國如果木把香港九龍歸還中國，則中英商務談判，實在無法進行。全國的人民固作如是的看法，　明的外交當局也必能洞悉其利害。退一步。我們爲英國政府着想，香港九龍也應該早日蹄還中國。因爲這兩地方一天不歸還中國，中英兩國人民間的裂痕，也就一天不能彌捕，而且兩國間的誤會與隔閡，更要愈演愈深。以過去一年來的情形而論，今年九月間我國在九龍城設治，香港方面强詞奪理，橫加阻撓，曾引起我國的抗議；上月間香港發生了警察蹴斃我國同胞慘案，在中國人民的心上，就投射下一層陰影，認爲今日的英國工黨政府，仍保持了保守黨帝國主義的作風。最近英軍竟又越界槍殺我國同胞，更引起我國全國人民的憤怒。所以香港九龍如不歸還中國，則這種不幸事件勢必層出不窮，影響所及，不僅中英邦交不能日趨密切，那且兩國人民的感情，恐將得况愈下。我們不能不引爲隱愛。</p>
<p>最後，我們不得不再向英國朝野進一言：英國在華地位的降落，並非由於列强間的競爭所致。他國的競爭原不足懼，最可怕的，還在英國本身，木知如何消除中英兩國人民間的裂痕。英國抓住了香港九龍，不肯放手，自以爲得計，在表面上看來，對於英國似乎有利，但是在實際上，英國所償付的代價，實在不可想像。請腎明的工黨政府權衡輕重，在香港九龍與中英商約二者之間抉擇其一吧！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦五日廣播：艾德禮首相，印總督，尼赫魯及眞納今日分別舉行會談，仍一無結果，定今夜再談。據消息靈通方面稱，無論成功與否，尼赫魯決於星期六飛返印度，印回關係未可樂觀。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕今日乃印度領袖與英政府要員會談之最重要之一日。倫敦權威方面雖不願有所透露，但據「紐約時報」倫敦特派員稱，會談實已陷僵局，決無成功之望。印度制憲議會已定星期一在新德里揭幕，而眞納仍拒絕考慮回盟之參加，尼赫魯亦未肯作絲毫讓步。英方對印度局勢已感覺十分灰心，圓桌會議召開之日期至今猶未能宣布。倫敦各報今晨載有尼赫魯公開發表之演說，仍稱印度命運應由印人自行決定，否則不能有解決一切問題之希望，他人之干涉即使出諸善意，亦徒然使局勢更趨複雜。蓋若有外界之千涉，吾人之注意力即不免被分散。今有許多印度人，不願大胆面對吾人必須面對之事實，而一味企求外人之援助，故爲今之計，首先應使印人了解眞正之解決，應由印人自己負責，若不幸而失敗，其後果亦當由印人担負。尼赫魯復謂，余於兩三日內即將返印，此行有何結果，尙不可知，但此來將見許多老友即將啓程返國，今晚尼赫魯將晤工黨前輩賴斯基敎授。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕聯邦法庭法官高爾斯勃魯今日判決，確聯會主席魯易斯蔑視法院所發罷工禁令，罰鍰一萬美元；但免其下獄監禁，礦聯會罰鍰三百五十萬美元。辯護律師聲明不服，提起上訴。法官斥靑煤礦工潮爲「駭人聽聞之事」。此種威脅若獲如願以償，將使美人遭受飢寒與窮困，傾覆其政府，而代以獨裁。若須在摧毁工會與維護國家之間有所抉擇，則當以國家爲重。法官旋向工會及魯易斯頒佈初步禁令。工潮倘不迅速結束，有加重懲罰之可能。</p>
<p>魯氏聞判，怒目而視，面上肌肉抽動。魯氏明日必須交保具結，三百五十萬元罰款分十四日繳付，平均每日廿五萬元。法官宣判時，勸魯易斯勿再度蔑視法令，辯護律師即大呼此乃「兇惡而反常之懲罰」。魯易斯當庭怒氣冲冲答辯，指責政府律師撒謊，法官乃加以警吿。煤礦工潮影響所及，至少有六個歐洲國家，美煤來源斷絕。法，比，義，丹，瑞士受影響最重。瑞典挪威與德國方面報吿：工業尙無停頓之象，但煤礦工潮倘不迅速結束，預料困難亦將增加。英國官方密切注視局勢，惟恐罷工延長，危及英國早已稀少之供給。美國方面，失業工人已增至五十七萬人，包括四十萬罷工礦工在內。鐵路禁止貨運後，一星期或十日之內，失業總數將跳至二百萬名。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕煤礦工潮，影響慘攻，今日已入第三週。聯邦法庭雖已判處礦聯會罰鍰三百五十萬元，並以重新控訴魯易斯與　聯會蔑視禁令及實施史密斯，康納萊法案相威脅，然工潮迄難遏制。魯氏顯抱決心，寗受縲絏之苦，或其他任何懲罰，但不願服從法庭禁令，或撤銷聯合會對政府合同之終止。鐵道勞工代表呼籲政府礦工勿再僵峙，而由絀統派委員會設法排解。是項呼籲尙未得政府或礦工之響應。</p>

<h3 id="c69">莫洛托夫採妥協態度　裁軍建議原則通過　交二十國小組會草擬提案 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>〔本報紐約特派員五日專電〕蘇聯外長莫洛托夫頃在聯大政治委員會中聲稱：蘇聯對於國際裁軍實施之否決權不致堅持，但列强應依據安理會之決議，同時實行裁减軍備。莫氏反對簽訂國際一條約，因其遷延時日，不能及早實行。美英代表對於蘇聯此舉一致表示歡迎。據觀察家猜測，蘇聯代表對此問題經延攔兩天後，已接獲莫斯科之新訓令，足證蘇聯業已改變其政策。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖四日電〕世界裁軍問題之討論，今日獲有些許進展。聯大政治委員會於聆取英美代表反對在裁軍事件中使用否決權之陳辭後，已任命小組委員會草具共同之裁軍草案。小組委員會係由中·英·美·法·蘇·荷蘭·加拿大·印度·捷克·巴拿馬·挪威·墨西哥·埃及·巴西·澳大利亞·哥倫比亞·比利時·叙利亞·烏克蘭·及阿根廷等二十國組成。在通過該項決定之先，蘇代表莫洛托夫曾有新建議提出，而美代表康諾利當即對蘇聯此一行動表示歡迎。惟同時則表示美國於目前尙不擬接受莫洛托夫之修正案，但願意給予最嚴重之考慮。美國仍堅主原子能委會之管轄職權及威信，不能有所損減，當繼續執行其原有之任務。英代表蕭克魯斯則稱，任何裁軍建議應以下列四項原則爲基礎：（一）在原子能委會擬具其計劃以前，裁軍決議案關於原子能之部份，仍應由原子能委會處理，聯合國全體大會不得干涉其工作。（二）裁軍不得僅以部份爲限，例如原子彈之製造雖已禁止，而其他具有集體破壞力之武器如火箭等則並未禁止，實萬萬不可。原子能委會應完成其目前之工作，提出管制原子能之計劃，該一計劃被普遍接受以後，應與其他具有大規模　壞力武器之管制辦法，同時施行。吾人認爲對原子能之管制，應以消滅其供戰爭用之可能爲已足，吾人同時應鼓勵原子能之供和平之用。（三）任何裁軍制度必須有即時並有效之控制及檢査制度，故全部軍備情報應與檢査機構設立時同時披露。（四）該一控制及檢査機構之工作，無論對於現有或將來發明之新武器，均不得受否決權之管制。吾人認爲對於將來所發明之新武器，亦應有管制之機構，蓋吾人相信原子彈被廢止以後，科學家必將努力研究更可怖之武器，故應有不受否泱權的束之國際機構，得以隨時應付此項局勢。莫洛托夫繼即表示渠對蕭克魯斯列舉之原子並不反對，並準備接受美國之建議以爲討論基礎，同時則希望接受蘇聯之修正案。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中美航空協定簽訂後，龍華機塲即將改造，俾巨型機得能降陸，而成爲近代化之國際航空基地。此項工程，需時約四五個月，需款國幣八百五十億元。</p>
<p>據可靠方面消息：交通部已專組機關，改建龍華機塲，十一月十五日，並已指派拔術人員負責，事實上工程已在進行中。路道亦將改築，使其能負担重量在十五萬磅以上之飛機。按C五十四式巨型運輸機需要能載重八萬五千磅之路道，而此次改築之月標，係在使超空級巨型機亦能使用。</p>
<p>除此大路道外，並將興建附屬跑道及停機綫。機棚則因需費過鉅，目前暫不建築，但將來可能興建若干目的性。全部工程，原定於三個月內完成，惟因設備不足，尤因運輸器材之缺乏，故須於明年四五月間，始可竣工。</p>
<p>龍華機塲工程完竣前，美國航空公司或將依據空運協定之規定。與江灣機塲合作，暫借該機塲使用。江灣機塲，原係日軍所建，後經美空軍改善，現專供聯總及美國空運大隊所屬飛機使用，將來則擬專供中國軍用機之需。</p>
<p>依照空運協定，將來美機亦得在天津及香港兩地降落，經過，及經營業務，但爲經濟所限，目前該二地之機塲尙未改造。惟將來改建之後，天津當較香港更爲重要。廣州現有白　及天　二機塲可供使用。其他國家對相似中美空輸協定之　商，目前尙未開始。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕軍醫署爲改進軍醫業務，配合建設國防新軍，最近在滬召集全國各地聯合後勤總司令部總醫院院長舉行業務會議，計劃在本市市中心區利用前敵軍所建醫院及其他建築，組成國防醫藥中心，從事訓練新軍醫技術人員以應國防各種衛生單位之需要。昨日下午該署並招待本市新聞界前往參觀。</p>
<p>國防醫藥中心範圍廣達二百餘畝，包括軍醫學校，總醫院，衛生材料總庫，衛生營，衛生實騐所，圖書館，博覽館等單位。其中軍醫學校分設醫科，牙科，護理科，衛生勤務科，醫事技術科，基本衛生訓練科等，可收賞四千八百餘人。總醫院規模之大及設備之佳，冠於全國任何醫院。病牀總數九百餘張，各種器械設備均係自前日本陸軍醫院接收而來，如日光燈，赤外綫，電氣按摩器，短波照視器，X光，特殊手術設備，牙科設備，莫不應有盡有，即煮飯洗衣亦有蒸氣煤氣設備，規模可見一般。院中現在傷病官兵二百餘人，其中以肺病患者爲數最多。衛生實騐所中有鹽水注射液製造所，每日大量製造供應全國。所中並蓄白兔數十頭，供試騐製成鹽水有無反應之用。衛生材料總庫中現有美方所贈新式救護車數十輛，此項救護車每車有担架牀十四張，另有一種則有担架牀四張，另可坐輕傷者十六人。一輛可抵普通救護車數輛之多</p>
<p>軍醫署以我國軍醫業務中最大缺點爲人才缺乏，故將積極推進此醫藥中心，抽調各部隊機關軍醫人員來此受訓，並招考學生分科專門學習。此外並選送成績優良之醫務人員分類分組赴美國軍醫中心實地研究，本年八月間已有一百二十一人專輸赴美。至於榮軍安置計劃，除嚴重殘廢無力營生者擬予以設院終身贍養外，其餘輔助就學就業或遣送回籍，此等工作尙賴社會團體共同協助以謀解決。</p>
<h3 id="c104">「豐年玉·荒年榖」　骨董商人的悲哀　古色古香的環境裏暗暗叫苦　憧憬着太平盛世的早日來臨 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「豐年玉，荒年榖。」在這戰亂不輟，百物昂貴，民生凋敝的今日，莫怪一般骨董商人都要呌苦連天了！</p>
<p>骨董兩字英語稱之爲Curious，作珍品解釋，或稱Antiquities即古代遺物之意。但除了「古」與「珍」兩項條件外，有人說，還必需對歷史和藝術有價値研究者，方能稱爲骨董。所涉範圍，亦廣泛得很，包括磁片·金石·珠寶·書畫·碑帖·雜器等等。</p>
<p>據他們業中人稱：在前清時代，由於民富物帛，一般王公大臣，都喜歡收藏。風氣所尙，各出高價爭購。因此當時的骨董業眞是黃金時期。到後來因爲國人愛好者漸少，加以爲經濟所限，亦無力收藏。民元以後，完全依賴外商維持。後來因爲各地掘填盜陵的風氣盛行，政府就下令禁止古玩出口。其間假貨贗品，亦層出不窮。</p>
<p>仿鑄一件商周時代式樣的銅器，利用　鹽等刷洗以後，埋置在士中，經過幾月以至幾年，亦能古銹斑斑，便將他混爲三代遺物了。有許多東西，眞假很難看出，連我們骨董商亦說不定它究竟是眞是假。</p>
<p>曾爲建都之地的北平·南京等地，大多是古玩業的中心。在本市亦有着很多古玩鋪，廣東路還有一家規模很大的古玩市塲。但爲了市面不景氣，難得有一筆交易。前幾天中國古物研究社舉辦了一個展覽會，陳列品中，一隻嘉靖高足杯標價一百五十萬，一只明代五彩廊西款雙鳳大碗標價六百萬，一顆鷄血石章要四百五十萬，一堂雕漆地大圍屏要三千萬。去參觀的人不少，但都祗「看看」而已。試想在這衣食爲先的年頭，誰還有那麼許多閒錢去買回這種飢不能食，寒不能衣的東西。有錢的文人雅士和附庸風稚的暴發戶，究竟是少數啊！</p>
<p>一堆廢銅爛鐵　却是稀世珍寶</p>
<p>收藏骨董成癖了的人，在「外行者」看來僅是一張舊畫，一塊化石，或一堆廢銅爛鐵，在他們或許正視爲稀世珍寶，價値連城，不惜想盡種種方法，欲把它佔爲己有。就爲了這種佔有慾，結果弄得喪失財產損害道德的，歷史上的例子亦多得很。像戰國趙惠文王的和氏璧，秦昭王以廣大城邑來換取。宋太宗遣一辯才，詐取一個和尙所愛藏的王義之墨蹟，到死後，還要把它帶入棺材。清代鄭楚在所作「骨董說」中有言：「骨肉起訟獄，朋友生猜疑，方其富貴日，價値千萬奇，及其貧賤來，不足換餅　。」這幾句話把骨董的弊害說盡了。</p>
<p>一位開明的骨董商人對我說得好：「我們對於骨董，應該基於攷古，歷史及藝術的觀點上，作探究研討，以貫通古今文化藝術爲前題。否則玩物喪志，又豈僅耗費金錢而已。今日開掘工作固然重要，但已經出土的古物，我們應當設法保存才對。」</p>
<p>勝利五個月間　美軍稍有問津</p>
<p>據國際貿易局的統計，單在民國廿一廿二兩年間，古玩出口已共値國幣二·三〇二·九九七元，想一想這當中有多少關於研究中國古代史及攷古學上的材料，就知道這是中國文化重大的損失。到如今國人研究本國的歷史時，有時必需遠涉重洋到倫敦或巴黎的圖書館去借抄資料，眞是無限感慨！</p>
<p>「三年不開張，開張吃三年，」本來是擋　古玩業利潤優厚的寫照。然而在今日，就拿古玩市塲內的　主來說吧，因爲一直沒有生意，已積欠塲方近百萬元租費。一位經營此業已數十年的老者，不勝感慨地對我說：「古玩業要等百業好後纔會好。百業不好，古玩業首當其衝，第一先不好。去年八月勝利後，因爲美國海軍到上海，曾經有五個月的時期，稍有些生意。但他們亦僅祗買些零星物件，帶回國去做做紀念品而已。有的甚至因爲袋裏沒有錢，跑進廁所，將內衣脫下換錢，買些價値美金十元八元的東西。但是等他們紛紛調往青島等地去後，這種生意亦就少了。</p>
<p>營業大非昔比　骨董商在改行</p>
<p>勝利後古玩沒有正式出口過，外國商人亦還都沒有來採辦。其原因當然是國共不能合作，物價高漲。到如今不怕羞恥的告訴你，有許多骨董商都已紛紛改行去賣報，擦皮鞋，變戲法，擺攤做小販去了。……」他搖頭苦笑憧憬似地說：「要等到國泰民安，風調雨順的時候，古玩業纔會有起色！」</p>
<p>便是今日骨董商人的悲哀！他們生活在珠玉琳瑯，字畫碑帖，古色古香的環境裏，然而這些東西飢不能食，寒不能衣。如今祗有苦苦挨守把滿腔希望寄之於太平盛世的早臨！</p>
<p>這兵荒馬亂的世界，到那一天纔會國泰民安風調雨順？又豈僅骨董商在這樣憧憬着。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市於敵僞時期，中外人士糾紛賣買房地產，致勝利後房地產糾紛案件特多。本市美商美安公司曾以坐落楊樹浦一三六三號空地及廠房十四幢，向法商東方匯理銀行洽做抵押。前曾償付百分之七十押　。太平洋戰後，其木淸償餘款，由保證人西班牙籍望德堂代償淸贖。因此關係，故至一九四二年三月二十一日，東方匯理銀行即託英商業廣公司轉立權柄　爲望德堂名義，由望德堂價賣與日商上海倉庫信託株式會社，並已向業廣公司換正業戶。勝利後，經敵僞產業處理局接收爲國有，該公司竟委託羅傑律師，具呈敵產處理局申請發運，並向行政院訴願。該案過程殊爲複雜，牽涉中·美·英·法·西班牙及日本六國，現行政院依訴願法第八條第一項前段駁回原訴，不予發還。</p>
<p>行政院所具理由如次：一查產業原爲日僑所有，或已　日偽出資收購者。其產權均歸中央政府所有。收復區敵偽產業處理辦法第四條第三項前段，有明文規定。本案房地產，曾經日商上海倉庫信託株式會社正式向望德堂價買，旣爲不爭之事實，則原處分官署依據前聞辦法所爲收歸國有之處分，即無不合。至訴願人所稱一該項房地產係由無所有權人（望德堂）私擅出賣，並不得有處分權人（訴願人）之同意，依法應屬無效一節，無論是否屬實，要係私權爭議責任問題，如訴願人因此有所損害，自應依法向該管司法機關訴請核辦，要不得以所有權之存續爲撤銷行政處分之請求，因行政長官署依行政法令所爲之處分，並非受司法判例之絕對拘束也。」</p>

<p>— 十一月廿六日航訊　本報特約濟南記者何冰如</p>
<p>最近一個傳奇式的案子，轟動了濟南市各個角落，此事內容，眞可說是香艷悱惻，充分地給予了靑年小姐們對於選擇終身伴侶的一個當頭棒喝！</p>
<p>絕代佳人　下堂棄婦</p>
<p>這個故事，從它開始到現在，中間有二十多年的歷史，發因於濟南，結束於重慶，其間種因收果，悲歡離合，極富於傳奇式小說的結構，同時是近代社會的一個反映。這個故事的主角，是歷下曾經名盛一時的絕代佳人——盛祖棻小姐，在民國十七年革命潮流中，她曾經遺棄了她的恩意如山的愛侶，事經十餘年，於抗戰期中，她竟不幸，又被她忠心事率的丈夫所遺棄，以致於淪洛在重慶的街頭，而成爲下堂的棄婦。近日有一位重慶歸客，在濟南佈露出一段往事，平地引起了一般人的感慨嘆惜，同時憶想到盛小姐當日的「天生麗姿」爲湖光山色的點綴！而盛小姐是皖南的士裔，歷下的佳人，在一般人腦海中，遺留着一個不可磨滅的印象！</p>
<p>往事如煙　徒勞回憶</p>
<p>當民國十四五年間，濟南女子中學，有一位高材生，姓盛名祖棻者，她是安徽的世家，寄籍濟南，這位盛小姐，確是一位絕代佳人，若引用舊小說上的話來形容她，「沉魚落雁閉月羞花」，盛小姐實可當之無慚，至於盛小姐體態的濃　，眞可稱「比之飛燕，吾嫌其瘦，堪之楊妃，吾憎其肥」，那樣的適中，再說到她的材學，雖不能比踪　道蘊，但她寫作俱佳，在一班姊妹行中，確是鶴立鷄羣，爲巾幗中不可多得的時代標準女性，她的當年住址，是在濟南，山東省議會的西邊，路北的一個大門內，門旁書有「皖南盛寓」四個大字，現在是幾經滄桑，不禁興「人面桃花」之感，她的父親盛一白民，是位學富五車的飽學先生一，也是不修邊幅的風流名士，這一位小姐承襲了父親的遺傳，家庭一的黨陶，而成爲名盛一時的時代一小姐。</p>
<p>孫郎艷福　睥睨士林</p>
<p>在那個時代，當然有不少羨慕小姐材貌進行求婚的人，眞是多如過江之鯽，車載斗量，難以數計的了，但是，一槪爲小姐所不取，惟獨有一位同鄕公子——孫劍虹得到了小姐的骨睞，成爲她的唯一愛侶，當時孫劍虹，也是安徽世家，任山東省財政應秘書，綺年玉貌，不僅與小姐年貌相富，並且新舊文學兼長，且不斷有作品在各種刋物發表，爲一般人所傳誦，是時明湖佛山之間，時見此一對愛侶徜徉於湖光山色之中，形影相隨，作景物上艷麗的點綴，歷下一般人士，咸羨孫郞艷福不淺，而孫郞亦以獨佔佳麗脾睨士林，這時盛小姐的家中，景况不佳，孫劍虹乃力予接濟，這也是他——孫劍虹應盡的責任，但是更有一事驅使他們愛情增進，就是盛小姐的父親盛白民，經孫劍虹介紹到靑島作了一名稅務官，不知怎樣虧空了公款，盛白民被押在法院裏，孫劍虹爲了愛情，爲了半子之分，不惜毁家紓難，賣凈了一切財產，親到靑島，從法院中救出了他的丈人峯：在事實上孫劍虹，旣是盛小姐的情人，而兼是盛小姐的恩人，因此一般人士，僉預料這對美滿情侶，必能永結同心，相偕白首。</p>
<p>別尋鴛侶　路人相看</p>
<p>詎料好事多魔，造化弄一人，民國十七年革命軍北伐，濟南發生慘案——五三慘案，使這一對情侶結婚期，不得不爲之延緩，未幾山東省政府在泰安成立，孫乃隨財政　到了泰安，盛祖棻也到了泰安，參加山東省黨務訓練班，她的親盛白民則在晨光報作了主筆，按情理來講，他們的婚禮，是很可能在泰安舉行，料想不到盛　　到了泰安後，受了潮流的洗禮，變成婦女界的進步份子，人人譽爲黨務訓練班之花，天天與小姐往來的人物，全是當時一班黨政界的權貴，心理上起了很大的變態，使效忘記了孫劍虹對她千萬鍾的恩愛，她自覺得她是一個革命的驕子，時代的寵兒，憑孫劍虹一個財政廳職員，地位旣小，袁頭又少，那能作小姐的終身伴侶，她一心一意的要別尋她理想上的鴛盟，或嫁一個省黨部的委員，或是一個留學的博士，方下合乎她的邏輯，遂把以往對孫劍虹的熱愛就漫漫消逝了，「孫郞從此是路人」，不能再作盛小姐的粧閣侍者了。</p>
<p>揮動慧劍　斬煩惱絲</p>
<p>盛祖棻對於孫劍虹，並作更進一步的逼迫，向孫提出解除婚的的要求，且吿訴他說：「除非你立刻能當縣長，或有若干萬元以上的資產，還可有商談的餘地，否則你死了心吧，不要再妄想當盛小姐的丈夫」孫劍虹遭遇了這個重大打擊，眞如同晴天霹露，懸崖失足，終日瘋瘋癲癲，不飲不食，咄咄書空，屢想自殺，幸終同事好友解勸，未出意外，經過相當時期之後，孫劍虹下了「大丈夫何患無妻」的決心，幷州一剪，剪斷了情絲，擺脫一切煩惱，立刻改名爲孫更生，表明過去的孫劍虹是死了，現在的孫更生是一個新人，立志上進，不久眞的當了縣長，爲窮職員爭出了一口氣，並且娶妻生子，成家立業，家庭中十分美滿，把心上的創痕重新溫暖補養起來了。</p>
<p>新人在笑　舊人在哭</p>
<p>但見新人笑，那聞舊人哭，當孫劍虹尋死覓活苦惱萬狀的當口，正是盛祖棻展開小姐交際手腕，大出風頭，趾高氣揚的時候，眞是風頭十足不可一世，時有省黨部某某委員雖曾被盛小姐認爲朋友，但是他向她求婚全沒有達到他的目的，後來有一位留美博士張鴻基君，獨獲雀屛之還，作了盛小姐的丈夫，　　　　，十分恩愛，以後雙雙到了靑島，感情仍是十分要得，，在山東社會傳誦一時的愛情悲劇，漸漸吿一段落，不再爲任何人所提起。</p>
<p>美人遲暮　情不可恃</p>
<p>民國二十六年七月七日，蘆溝橋的砲聲，引燃了遍地烽火，中國人爲保衛祖國，對日本抗戰，不久戰雲瀰漫到山東，張鴻基，也帶了他的愛妻，逃難到了後方重慶，在北碚編輯館作事，但是夫妻　的感情，忽然惡化起來，究竟是色　愛弛呢？還是另有原因呢？外間不曉得內幕眞象，但是在抗戰尙未勝利之前，張鴻基忽悠把盛祖棻遺棄了，說是盛祖棻有神經病，離了婚自己離開北碚，上了成都某大學當敎授，至此盛祖棻遂成了下堂的棄婦。</p>
<p>泥絮之身　難逐楊花</p>
<p>盛祖棻被人遺棄後，果然半瘋半　起來，起初還住在北碚，終日到處呼喚她的丈夫，並說他的丈夫馬上就要來接她，有人問他是離了婚了嗎？她茫然了，後來她在北碚旅館裏被人逐出，她便携帶了她所僅有的一個網籃，一床被褥，離開了北碚，搭上船一直到了重慶，在朝天門碼頭，坐了一乘轎子，東撞西撞了半天，始終沒一個地方找出她的丈夫，轎夫也看出了她的神經不正常，把她推下轎來，她自己又走進了朝天門中正路一個新興旅館，闖進了一個已有男人住的房間，說是她的丈夫，非住在裏邊不可，人家又把她驅逐出來她便轉到了對面的一座高坡上，那個地方呌做「朝天驊」，兩旁的房子因爲折火巷的緣故，有家門旁，地上堆積一些磚，上邊的屋也有一條瓦，無論狂風大雨，她全是侷促在這個地方，竟作了盛小姐的臨時香巢，也不知盛小姐在春之日，冬之夜，池運夏開，宮槐秋落的景况內曾否憬憧到她個人的往事，有沒有感覺到自身巳成沾泥的褲絮，不能再獻身於交際塲所，與一班飛舞的楊花，上下競逐了吧！</p>
<p>孫郎多情　小姐薄命</p>
<p>盛小妣並在她所住的地方，牆上地下寫出很秀麗的字，尋找她已經失去了的丈夫，因此轟動了附近的街鄰看到這個受過高等敎育的女子，淪落到這個樣子，共起了憐惜的同情心，每天總有幾位慈善的婦女給她送飯吃，不久有位山東太太路遇這個地方，就把這件事，轉吿於山東同鄕，便有不少的人給她送錢送衣，還報吿山東婦女界領袖們，設法救濟她，不久又有她的老師把她接在「兩路口」一家旅館裏，一面由山東同鄕捐給她一部份款子，一面寫信成都給她的丈夫，但是得的回信上說，「業已離婚不能過問」，同時她在泰安時候交下的幾位闊人朋友也在重慶，但，全不承認與她相識了，祇有一個被她遺棄了的愛人，改名孫更生的孫劍虹，一往情深，不念舊怨，佔在悲天憫人的立塲，給她送了好多的錢，但是這位小姐的命太薄了，不久這位瘋癲小姐，又被旅館主人逐出，流落重慶街頭，起初尙見她沿街乞討，後來漸漸的不知下落，當每個人在街頭看見她時，誰又能想到她是廿年前萬人追求的美人兒呢？</p>
<h3 id="c167">靜寂的寶山城 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 寶山二日訊仲英</p>
<p>寳山，並沒有山，而是一個古老的，荒蕪的，凄凉的小縣城。它每日靜寂的蹲伏在水天一色的揚子江的盡頭。它的形狀，方方地好像一塊豆腐乾，那種卑陋的窘况，寒酸得十分可憐，你看，城門旣舊且破，城牆又薄復低，雉堞倒坍殆盡，全身充滿彈痕。的確，它是一個久經風霜，遍體鱗傷的病人了。它曾經受過砲火的淫威，它曾經受過屠殺的虐待，它是從虎口裏爬出來的，它是從魔掌中跳出來的。</p>
<p>勝利公園　忠烈祠碑</p>
<p>你要是走進城去，必定會使你嚇得一跳，因爲城內都是一片瓦礫，斷牆殘垣，觸目皆是。我們很可以用「荒烟與蔓草齊飛，庭鼠和野兔奔馳」的話來描寫他，這不是我的過份形容，也不是我的善於宣傳，你只要看一看寳山城內勝利公園內袁希洛老先生所作的寳山縣忠烈桐碑記，就可以確信無疑了。那碑記中最使人警惕的，就是下面的一段事實：</p>
<p>「……二十一年一月二十八日，倭出兵侵我寳山，上海，我駐淞滬十九路軍將士，激於義憤，起而抗敵，與倭血戰達一月又五日，三萬健兒，死傷達二萬以上，械缺無援，乃退守瀏河，全縣淪陷達三月，縣城及吳淞，江灣，閘北，市裏民房之被砲火所毀者，十之五六，人民之死傷者以萬計，……」。這是寳山第一次的浩刧，但不久二十六年的「八一三」抗戰又爆發了，這一次的戰爭，更要比上一次厲害，現在我們再把碑記，繼續看下去。</p>
<p>「……至八月十三日（按係民國廿六年），倭以陸，海，空軍，攻我吳淞，上海，我軍與敵血戰達三月，械彈不足，三十萬人死傷殆盡，全縣又淪陷，淞滬失守，……」。這是寳山第二次的浩劫，道一次的戰爭，眞可以說驚天地而泣鬼神，損失之大，難以計算，於是寳山這一個渺小的縣城，不僅揚名於全國，就是達到世界上也知道他的大名了。寶們很可以想像至，也可以意料到，他的荒蕪，他的凄凉，實在是難免的。</p>
<p>交通困難　食米不裕</p>
<p>寳山濱江面　，半　　　，被江水緊緊地包圍着，所以他出東門是江，出北門也是江，只有南門可以通吳淞，西門可以通月浦，羅店等鎭，交通不十分便利，尤其是經過了歷次的浩刧，公路破壞無遺，因爲經費的困難，所以到現在還沒有修復，公路上沒有商辦或官營的汽車行駛，憧憧所見者，只有那飛逝如箭，川流不息的脚踏車而已。原來寳山的脚踏車，十分盛行，不論是老頭子。小姑娘。都會踏得，他們不僅乘了脚踏車在吳淞·月浦·羅店等地往還，就是距離很遠的上海，也是早赴夕返，習以爲常的，所以在交通困難的情形下，脚踏車就成爲他們唯一的工具了。</p>
<p>寳山的土地，完全是砂土性質，不適於植稻，只可以種棉，所以是一個產棉區域，食米十分缺乏，大部依賴外埠供給，因此米價的高，比任何地方要來得厲害，際此米珠薪桂，百物在漲的日子下，一般窮苦的老百姓，呌他怎麽樣想法可以使他活下去呢？據調査所得，此地的老百姓，吃白米飯的人家，很少很少，他們大多數是吃的用小麥和糙米混合而煮的麥粞飯，黄黄的，粗粗的使我們見了要作嘔，但他們不管一切的把來灌下肚去。</p>

<h3 id="c168">癌症之今日觀 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 孫曾一</p>
<p>「癌症」這個並不新奇然却極端可怕的名詞，想已普遍的爲人注意了。的確，牠是個殺人不眨眼的充滿恐怖性的絕症。根據美國國立癌症研究院的報告，平均每三分鐘就有一人死於這可怕的疾病。在我國雖無可靠紀錄，想亦不會少於此數。由此可知，牠對於國民生產和民族經濟上都是個絕大的損失。</p>
<p>雖然這種病在「史前期」巳有存在，但是牠的普遍被醫界人士認識，才是近頃數世紀的事。我們在日常問診等經歷中，每天碰到癌症的機會，似乎日甚一日。但是這並不能說，以前癌症患者絕對少數：這却是多少病理家臨床研究家等立下的汗馬功勞，使這病的症狀能早期正確認識，不致忽略。現在不要說醫生，就是衛生醫藥知識程度比較高一些的普遍人也多能疑心到癌症的可能性。然而對於牠的成因特性和究無治愈希望等能知其便概者，究屬不多。爰於此數點有所申述焉。</p>
<p>廣義的說，癌症是瘤的一種，即俗稱惡性瘤者也。爲某種身體細胞生長畸形，失却管制，以致侵蝕及損害正常細胞或鄰近組織的生長或功能，卒至人體營養耗損粘　甚至死亡。其生長之快慢，遷徙之遠近，蔓延之大小都非人體所能控制。即將此瘤完全割除，亦不能永遠阻止其速度遷徙於萬一。如直腸癌雖經手術割除，仍可能遷徙至肝臟等並不相連的器官。準是觀之，這純是細胞失常有以致之。欲研究其治療方針，必先窮究其成因與根源，細胞之何以失常，及正常細胞與癌細胞的分別。則癌症之對症治療，庶幾有　焉。</p>
<p>並非傳染病</p>
<p>很多人還以爲癌是有傳染性的，然而至今還沒有看到醫生護士或病人家屬因接觸等而感染同病的先例。有人甚至將患者經切片診斷確爲癌之組織接種於皮下，而經數十年毫無癌症現象。近百年來荷蘭豚鼠兔等均曾用作試騐動物，而無可資傳染之證明。在目前說，癌的成因是非傳染性的，因人體細胞先天的或後天的對癌感受性的增強，或受致癌素（Car　inogan）在其適宜環境下的侵蝕所致，遺傳之影響亦爲重大誘因之一，每有一家數代均患癌症者（其部位性質因可不同）。其原因可由細胞特異或特別靈敏之感受性解釋之。胚胎學上完全相同之孿生子女有很多機會同時生性質酷似的相稱之癌。由是可知，如遺傳影響相似，則細胞對生癌之感受性亦同，如在不同家族中，遺傳影響互異，則細胞感受性亦互異，即同一人在其一生中，對各種癌症之感受性亦復時時變化，無準則可資遵循。</p>
<p>死亡率可驚</p>
<p>更有不可己於言者，常人每以癌症爲中年後易罹之疾，殊不知據美國研究癌症機構統計，在一九四二年度中，五歲以下小孩之死於癌症者多於死於急性腎炎或幼兒性麻痺者。同年中在五至九歲及十至十四歲之孩童，癌之死亡率較痢疾百日咳白喉或麻疹爲高，故癌症雖以接觸致癌素之機會多，較多見於中年以後患者，然其於嬰孩，縱不多觀，爲害之烈，眞不可等聞視之也。</p>
<p>邇來醫藥科學之進步，不可謂少，即以人類四大病害來說，炎症則亦既有磺胺製劑，又有配尼西林，雖不可云百發百中，至少當有七成以上把握，至於禍害不輸於癌症之結核，也有Streptothnicin等類的抗生物（Antibiotic）之產生，雖臨床上尙未成功，至少總已有曙光可見，且最近台灣發明之結核治療亦醫蓬蓬勃勃前途無量。獨於這爲害最巨且劇的癌症之特效治療尙付缺如。大家都很關心牠的成功，各國醫藥家科學家亦都不惜工本的大加研究，到底有無成功希望，茲亦略加闡明之。</p>
<p>沒有特效藥</p>
<p>欲研究癌之治療，有人以爲必先找出一種絕對無生癌傾向或極少生癌之動物，而後加以分析，得研究出此類動物與特別易受癌侵蝕的動物之異點，或查出其對致癌素質抗力和感受性的不同，然後得有以改進或指正之，不幸在各種家畜動物和蛙魚雞鼠中，都普遍的流行着癌病，即是在植物中亦有一種肖似癌症的疾病，所以在這一方面的勞力，到現在爲止是失敗了。</p>
<p>其次便有人開始注意到自受致癌素侵蝕後至開始有癌之　家所需的時間因素，照有人統計，一人經長短不同時期的　　工作（特別是阿尼林Aniline染料）而改就他業，水不與此　致癌素接觸，然而他或她可能於一年至十七年後產生膀胱癌，X光科醫生護士或技術員可於最後一次接觸後於一年至十一年間發生皮膚癌，經一次火燙後癌症可於一月至二年中於患處出現，故癌症之發生，有長途與捷徑之分，有時一初發性癌可於別處產生大羣的繼發性癌，而有時則否，有的生長奇速而有的生長慢甚，中間更可有一段生長遲緩之隱性期，而隨之以快速遷徙或漫延，有的則永遠進入隱性期，而極少數則能進入靜止期而完全消失，所以吾人身體內必有所加速緩遲或抗拒癌症發生之神秘素質存在，或必有環境上之順逆，而影響其成長，茍能將此神秘打破，則癌之治療又將步入一新紀元矣。</p>
<p>研究致癌素</p>
<p>再次則屬於致癌素（Carcinogen）之研究，吾人已知即最平凡之日光紫外光　錠X光及別種放射性物質，以及數種煤膠（Coaltar）染業，特別是阿尼林（Aniline）類，都爲有名的外來致癌素，遺傳因素或對致癌感受性特强等都爲內在的致癌素，縱如內在的無法去除，外來者却能盡量避免，如此則產生癌症之可能性自少矣。</p>
<p>要之，癌症決非不治之症，如能以研究原子彈之精神物力人力加以適當運用，則在此醫藥科學日新月異之際，癌症之早日得有對症特效治療，希望實大，然在目前，吾人最好能盡力避免罹這可怕的疾病，假如一旦有了這病，就得早日請科學醫早期診斷合理治療，如此則至少生命可以延長，痛苦可以减少，切勿延誤治療機會，自貽伊戚，每有病者忽略，將早期可行割治之胃癌遷延時日，待至遷徙到肝臟腹膜等處產生黃　腹水等始來就醫，則及時割治之期已過，治療成績自不可與早期診斷合理醫治者同日而語，若斯則癌之治療，在目下端賴病者與醫生的互相合作，始克爲功，茍一方忽略，則功虧一簣矣。</p>

<h3 id="c169">獻給各位肺癆病胞之　一封公開信 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 吳紹青</p>
<p>數月來，　承各地患者　　訊問，關於最近市上出現之各種治癆新藥意見，因恐不能一一　答，特藉本欄作較詳情之解答，掬誠忠告，尙希　察！查近百年來，舉世各國，對於治癆新藥，　不　精竭慮，分頭探討，幾乎每年皆有新藥問世，迄目下爲止，無慮數百種，遠之如化學藥品，金屬製劑，繼之以菌苗漿抗毒菌液等類，近之則更有大艾松（Diason）Promin　　Promizole使他肺安定（Stepharanthin）及Streptomycin等，種類之多，品質之雜，實舉不勝舉，每當一種新藥問世，各國廠商，莫不競相宣傳，而一般患者，亦莫不寄以深切之期望，以爲特效藥既已發明，從此可以藥到病除，脫離苦海矣！但曾幾何時，流幣出，後悔莫及者，比比然也。按之任何一種治癆藥品，在應用人體以前，値得研究者，厥有三端，分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）藥物之毒性：每種藥物，在未經應用以前，當先經動物試騐，測定該項藥品之毒性如何，藥理作用如何，藥量如何。——包括有效量，極量，中毒量，致死量等。——經證明確實有效無毒後，再行試用。</p>
<p>（二）藥物對於肺癆菌之殺菌力，亦須先經細菌學家之研究探討，方爲可靠，往往一種藥物，對培養在試騐管內之肺癆菌，確有控制或殺減之力，但一經動物試騐時，反又無效者有之，更有某種藥物，雖對培養在試騐管內之肺癆菌，既有殺菌之力，同時再行動物試騐時，又曾證明其確有改善病狀，抑制病勞，减低死亡率等之功效者，然若更進一步，用之於人體時，則又反告失敗者，臨床上實復不少。例如最近美國新出之Streptomysin以及Diason等，曾經美國專科醫家研究，其結果，對於培養在試騐管內之肺癆菌，確有控制其繁殖能力，繼又用於動物試騐時，亦復證明其有相當良好之成績，便最後應用於患者時，迄至最近，尙無公認有特效功能。相反的，此種希望正在逐漸消失中，但目下仍在繼續研究改良。蓋人體之細胞組織，其內在之抵抗機能，以及天然之免疫因素，與試騐之動物迥異，往往在動物體中能奏效者，未必在人體中亦能同樣奏效也。以是一種藥物之是否有效，須老察其在試騐管內之成績，經動物試騐後之成績，以及在臨床上實地應用於病人之成績，斷不可斷章取義，一概論之。</p>
<p>（三）藥物對於癆病之功效，患者攝取某種治癆新藥後，對其體內之結核病灶，是否有逐漸改善頃向，屢經多次X光檢騐後，有無進步現象，患者一般之健康狀况，服藥後，有無明顯進步，以及痰內癆菌，是否消減等，亦宜注意研究，凡此皆爲治療肺病有無功效之標準測騐。</p>
<p>總之：凡一種治癆新藥問世，在未經以上三者精密考查，仔細研究以前，實不敢輕易介紹，若病者自行購報，無法察知中毒情形，倘存姑試僥倖心理，其危險性更大。要之此等所謂特效藥者，皆在試騐時期尙未脫離動物實騐與臨床實騐之階段。在今日之科學昌明時代，吾人所公認治療肺癆之方法，仍不外謀增進人體之抵抗力，再加上安定肺部患處，以及施行以壓縮肺部爲目的之各種手術，其法不一，要在善能選擇耳。若病至晚期，患處範圍既廣，而患者之一般抵抗力，亦每况愈下，縱有良法，愛莫能助矣！尙望患者善自注意幸勿輕信廠家之宣傳，爲其眩惑。損失金錢，尙係小事，損害了健康，則後悔莫及矣。</p>

<p>麻瘋是一種慢性傳染病，由麻瘋桿菌所造成，組織受害最深者，莫如皮膚神經兩紊，病狀頗不一律，有局部麻木·斑疹·結節·潰瘍，和殘廢等。麻瘋廣佈世界各處，熱溫帶和潮濕的地方，最易繁殖；我國廣東·廣西，和蘇北較多，北方除山東外較少。傳染的方法理論不一，大多由於和病者接觸而來，加以其他副因：如營養不好，貧苦飢寒，住地潮濕，人口衆多等，普通十歲到四十歲的人，易生此病，而男人又多於女人。麻瘋的潛伏期頗長，少至數月，多則數十年，平均大概二年至四年不等，西　一九三一年，吳德　金先生將麻瘋分爲下列三類：</p>
<p>甲，神經性　凡是神經有了麻瘋的損害都屬此類，例如感覺失常色素和循環的改變，營養阻礙·麻痺·萎縮·攀縮·潰瘍等。</p>
<p>乙，皮膚性　凡是皮膚有了麻瘋的損害統屬本類，依照損傷程度的輕重，可分三種。</p>
<p>丙，混合性　兩種兼而有之。</p>
<p>麻瘋的症象</p>
<p>甲，初起現象　麻瘋初起時，不易認識，有時先發熱，感覺頭痛·背酸，消化不好，精神不振，有時皮膚同時呈現斑疹或感某一部分特別疼痛出汗减少，經過一月半者，麻瘋病象全現方才大悟。</p>
<p>乙，皮膚性麻瘋　初發的時候，小塊皮膚，呈現疹狀斑點，不易察覺，等到面部四肢多處出現始行就醫，此種斑疹屬於充血性，先呈紫紅後現咖啡色，表面略縐如鱗狀邊厚而稍突起，當相融援像迴形輪瓣，此後皮膚逐漸變粗而且有時結節，其中所需時間大概數月乃至數年不等，等到面部充滿了結節面容難認好像獅面，如果檢騐鼻黏膜或皮膚，麻瘋細菌十之八九可以看到。</p>
<p>丙，神經性麻瘋　初亦發斑疹，不過較皮膚性爲大而已，色素變化很早，疹之中央逐漸脫色呈淺性麻木瘢痕，邊緣反而擴大，此時神經有麻刺痛癢，出汗减少，久之營養妨礙，病區肌肉萎縮感覺失常，頸部神經發覺變粗，日久潰瘍，甚至手足脫落，病人或日夜疼痛，各種併發症如角膜炎·喉炎·肺炎等油然而生。</p>
<p>麻瘋的預防</p>
<p>預防的方法是針對病菌的侵入，阻止其發展，其間除非人力所能及者如氣候災異預防的步驟，不外個人和公共兩種：</p>
<p>甲，個人預防：</p>
<p>第一注重清潔　麻瘋桿菌之侵入大半假道皮膚，保持皮膚清潔實爲至要。</p>
<p>第二當心營養　營養不好很易引起疾病，麻瘋不能例外。</p>
<p>第三不要過量　無論工作遊嬉或飲食不宜過量，以免减低身體的抵抗力。</p>
<p>第四避免接觸　麻瘋初期皮膚發疹結節傳染性最大達百分之九十以上。</p>
<p>乙，公共預防：</p>
<p>端賴大家合作，改進人民生活，灌輸人民衛生常識，設立專門機關敎育人才來研究本病的發展治療及預防，調查麻瘋的區域，檢騐可疑的病人並選診斷屬實者分別加以治療和隔離。</p>
<p>至於麻瘋的治療普通多以大楓子油的製劑行肌肉注射須數月或數年之久，病好不好全視病症的輕重和病家能否耐心治療爲斷。</p>

<h3 id="c171">又一抗瘧新藥 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>美國在戰時以政府力量從事抗瘧藥之研究。在聯邦科學研究推廣局（OSRD）主持之下，組織了　疾研究聯絡會，聯合全國公私研究機關，從事於此項研究。數年來共用經費七百餘萬美元，研究之藥物數萬種。本刊上期已報告之格魯若奎（或氣蕊喹啉），按研究次序稱SN7618。十月十二日聯絡會主席R.F.Loed博士又報告一種抗瘧藥，按次序稱SN13,276，定名五烷喹啉（Pentaguine），代表抗瘧藥研究之又一大進步。聞日瘧不易根治，經奎寗或阿的平治療後，復發者佔百分之六十以上，有達百分之九十以上者。拍拉母困與此二藥合用後，確能减少其復發率，但復發者仍屬不少，且其毒性甚大，應用不當極易中瘧。五烷喹啉之抗瘧療效，於鷄瘧實騐，爲奎寗之八十倍，拍拉母困之八倍但其對於小鼠毒性則　爲拍拉母困之三分之一。故其療效與安全性，均達較拍拉母困爲佳。據臨床實騐，如用五烷喹啉每日六十公絲，（相當於其燐酸鹽信息八十公絲）奎寗每日二公分，每四小時一次，連服十四日，可根治重痧間日瘧，而停止其復發。但此藥之每日劑量不得超過六十公絲，且應於醫師監護下用藥，蓋其臨床應用目前尙未脫離實騐時期也。</p>

<p>— 紹</p>
<p>結核性腦膜炎乃一種嚴重之疾病，其死亡率幾爲百分之百。文獻中雖載恢復例約計六十例之報告，但其中診斷上尙有疑問者不在少數。Cooke等首先於本年初報告一週歲嬰孩之結核性腦膜炎，經鏈徽素（斯瑞妥美星）治愈，九月間Keefer等又報告鏈徽素治愈之此病四例，但各例於治愈後的遺留種種神經病變，故其最終預後仍不能視作良好。</p>
<p>最近紐久西之Krefchik氏於十月十九日美國醫學會雜誌報告之一例，經鏈徽素治療後，完全恢復，毫無遺留症狀，尤爲特色。病人係一十五月之男孩，經診斷爲結核性腦膜炎，於得病二星期後開始鏈徽素治療，治療共計五十七日，鏈徽素總量：肌肉注射二千四百萬單位，椎管內注射二百八十萬單位（脊椎穿刺六十五次）。</p>

<p>— 紹</p>
<p>溶菌酵素（Lysozyme）係英國細菌學家Fleming氏於發明配尼西林前所發明，時在一九二一年。此素溶菌作用極爲强大，作用迅速，但對普通病原菌之作用較弱，故該氏旋即放棄，不再繼續研究。嗣後學者注意者不多。但正當牛津方面學者重新研究該氏發明之配尼西林時，蘇俄學者却對溶菌酵素發生興趣，且其用途不僅限於醫療，亦用於工業上。</p>
<p>蘇俄所用溶菌酵素，主用鷄蛋白製成，有時亦用紅　葡或白　葡製之。據稱能殺滅鏈球菌及葡萄狀球菌，對於痢疾桿菌，傷寒桿菌及霍　弧菌，則能制止其繁育。</p>
<p>臨床上主用於傳染性創傷，特別用於角膜創傷傳染之防治，亦用於植皮前之準備。據Voronova氏之報告，此素對於兒童腹瀉，亦具卓效。</p>
<p>於工業上，其粗製品用於魚子醬之製造。魚子之用其溶液洗淨者，可保持其新鮮不變達一年之久，其溶液亦用以浸麻，使織維易於分開。</p>

<h3 id="c174">書中仙陳樹老 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>民國三十五年十二月五日至十一日，僑務委員會委員長陳樹人先生在南京香舖營文化會堂開個展，陳列抗戰前後的作品，有人物，山水，鳥獸，魚蟲，以及珠江，長江兩流械，四川名勝等實地寫生：眞是洋洋乎大觀！可惜我還覊留在上海，恐未必能躬與其盛；也許在此六日內中央大學正式上課，我來得及晋京，重晤陳樹老和他的作品。</p>
<p>我說「重晤」，是有根據的。遠在民國廿四，廿五年之交，爲了籌備列入「中法文化業書」的「陳樹人近作」（商務印書館），我幾乎天天與樹老會晤，商討該集的內容：選畫，製版，解釋，序文。樹老是很洒脫的人，我自己不懂得客套：我放肆點說，我們竟成了忘年交！那時天氣很冷，樹老往往領了全家以及我，上小館子去吃火鍋或涮羊肉。抗戰以來，樹老風采依然；而筆者已是白髮叢生，失去了當年的閑適情緒！這部「陳樹人近作」原是預備給中外人士看的，所以有相當長的中文序和法文序，以及每幅畫前加法文解釋；印刷之　，　甲於商務印書館所有的彩色　　；二這一點，王雲五先生當然知道得最淸楚。這個集子獲得國內外批評界一致的美譽，這也反　樹老畫品的高超。我接着準備一張書旅近作」，接洽「徐悲鴻近作」。書旂的畫潠齊後，已同王雲五先生過目，畫也存在商務印書館：「八·一三」爆發，一切都成泡影！然而，可喜的是近年來，書旂的畫猛列進步；而　　慶嘉陵江對面磐溪的中國　術學院裏，悲鴻親口答應我參加達套叢書。此外，還打算籌備　齊白石近作」，「張大千近作一、「汪亞塵近作」……。我熱　布望繼王雲五先生而長商務印書館的朱經農先生，一俟經濟情形好轉，玉成筆者這個書生報國的宏願！</p>
<p>我生平最怕見達官要人，因爲他們在生理上和心理上有些反常：他們的眼睛比老百姓生得高，他們的骨架子也比我們生得大（可是，患着嚴重的軟骨症），開出口來一片官腔，他們所用的字彙也和咱們的不同，他們有些像筆記小說裏所形容的笑面無常！陳樹老曾經是達官，是要人；到了今日，他依然是不掌生殺之權的達官。他時時笑容滿面，却非無常！他像一隻鶴，他像一枝梅，他像出於汚泥而不染的荷花。淸高自然，和藹可親，絕無半點烟火氣，更沒有藝術暴發戶的行徑：凡是接近過樹老的人，必能贊成我的說法。</p>
<p>言爲心聲，畫爲心影二樹老的畫像樹老的爲人。不論樹老所取的畫材爲何，他的畫面所表示的是一片寗靜。即使他畫了一隻猛獸，畫面也決不緊張。這句話，粗聽來，似乎是微辭；仔細硏究，却又不然。暫且撥開繪畫不談，祇論自然界的現實：如果你面對獅子頭（這是非洲的獅十頭，但是標本）端詳片刻，，便能發現它的表情是非常寗靜的：獅爲百獸之王，牠足以抵禦一切暴力的襲擊，何必緊張呢？所以大智若愚，大勇若怯，不是眞的愚，眞的怯。樹老畫面的寗靜並非死氣沉沉。樹老用色大都偏於明色；——「明」色不一定是「暖」色。愛用明色的往往是胸襟曠達，心無墨礙的人：樹老就是如此　。有時，樹老用的色調極端鮮，却能免俗，予人精神上的向陽之感。</p>
<p>樹老欲築室西子湖畔，終老畫事。何日能實現這個佳夢呢？會當追隨左右，漫步於蘇白兩堤，一吐鬱積胸中的俗氣。</p>

<h3 id="c177">漫談女作家 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 談宜</p>
<p>「奇女」趙清閣</p>
<p>在現階段的文壇上，若以省區而論，河南籍的女作家實在太少了。除却唐河的馮沅君外，可以在文壇上獨樹一幟的，應推信陽的趙淸閣。而在著作的數量上講，馮的年齡雖比趙大，但趙著的劇本，小說，散文　　目前爲止，除在申報上連載的「雙宿雙飛」尙未出版外，其已出的單行本已不下廿餘種。</p>
<p>談到趙淸閣的著作，當然是以劇本爲最者。劇本之中，尤以得過敎育部獎金，被選爲四大優良劇本，與老舍合作的「桃李春風」，最爲人重視。但據我個人看來，「桃李春風」還不如「生死戀」富於文學意味。「生死戀」是描寫一個女伶，爲了正義，運用她的聰敏與美貌，一方面玩弄着僞組織的重要份子，一方面掩護着愛國的地下工作者，卒至以身殉國，以身殉愛。她把那女主角寫得恰如其份。旣不落抗戰八股的巢日，也朱將她寫成神出鬼沒的偵探小說中的俠客。而其情節經過，緊張而活潑，曲折而有趣。最後結局，允使人感動下淚。</p>
<p>據她在「生死戀」的自序上說，那本劇本曾經三易其稿，四次修改。發表之後，後方各地爭着上演。此後她又繼續寫了好幾部以抗戰爲題材的，敎育的，戀愛的劇本。在她的劇本中，都是充滿了美麗的，溫柔的，細膩的女孩子的溫情。當然，以她的身世與個性，寫出來的文章，決不會有那些氣燄萬丈，火氣逼人的一東西。而在不認識她的人，祗讀了她的作品，總以爲她在情塲中翻騰過一番了，深嚐了戀愛的蜜果或苦水，才能體會到其中之味。其實，她是一個典型的北方小姐。不僅沒有一個戀人，便是在社交中亦極有分寸。雖然她有很多文壇上的朋友，無論年輕的，年老的，有色彩的，無色彩的，她都來往。但，她能保持她的淸，保持她自已的立塲，決不爲任何人，任何客觀環境所左右。也正因爲道個原故，她能受到各方面的愛護。</p>
<p>她雖然是河南人，但離開河南很早，十幾歲時，便帶着一枝筆，從開封到上海，一面讀書，一面寫文章，用自己的勞力養活自己，一直到現在。因爲她不依賴任何政治勢力，也不須要別人經濟上的援助，所以在抗戰中生活雖苦，精神却非常愉快。得到了稿費和版稅，便沽一瓶美酒，邀幾個文友，不論是男是女，便暢飲一番。她從來沒有意識到自已是個女孩子，尤其和老年人在一起，多飲了幾杯時，更加逸興横飛豪放不覊。</p>
<p>嗜酒之外，她還愛吃好茶和好香烟。這或許和她的寫作生活有關係吧，沒有烟茶酒，她簡直像失去了生命。所以她的稿費收入，幾乎是百分之六十消耗在這三件東西上面。</p>
<p>田漢在四川北碚時曾有一苜時送給效。至今還掛在她上海寫所內。詩云：</p>
<p>「從來黨趙多奇士，淸閣翩翩似健男。側帽更無脂粉氣，傾杯能作甲兵談。豈因泉水知寒暖，不得山茶辨苦甘。敢向嘉陵尋畫料，彈花如雨大河南。」</p>
<p>可爲淸閣寫照。蓋其時她正在主編「彈花文藝」，而雅好男裝也。</p>
<p>最近她將紅樓夢改編成四部劇本。三部已出版，第四部在文潮月刋上連載。據她表示，此後將改變作風，從事長篇小說創作了。</p>
<p>就她已出版的幾篇如「鳳」，「月上柳梢頭」等長篇創作看來，我相信她的成就常比劇本更大。</p>
<p>最近，她拜了齊白石做老師，某報說她將放棄寫作從事學畫了，其實道「學」字頗爲不妥，因爲她本來能畫，而且風格很高，不過輕易不肯動筆，除一二知交外，很少人看見過她的作品。</p>
<p>此外，她還能唱京戲，寫過平劇劇本，當過中央靑年平劇社的編導。替天一影片公司作過曲。道些知道的人更少了。</p>
<p>最後，還有一則笑話，有一讀者，因爲崇拜她的作品，特地寫信去向她致敬，開頭一句便是「我敬愛的淸翁老夫子」原來此人看了她的名字，誤認她是一位年高德劭的「老」先生也，其實她還正在妙齡，而且論才貌，當代女作家中恐怕很少能比得上她呢。</p>

<p>— 天行</p>
<p>我在上海犬學讀書時，使我最不能忘懷的是一位胡樸安先生，他是安徽涇縣人，今年己有七十多歲了，滿面虬寗，性好豪飲，不僅是國學專家，而且擅長太極拳。</p>
<p>雖然他也曾做過幾年大官，如考試院的專門委員，江蘇民政廳長，而現在却仍是兩袖清風，依然過着筆耕舌耕的生活。</p>
<p>這位胡老師，是個全國聞名的學者，可是他的出身，並不如一般人的想像；什麼書香門第，家學淵源，而他實實在在的是一個學徒。在他那裏，講給我聽有這樣的話：</p>
<p>『我幼年時期是一個商店裏的學徒，這因爲我家中是很貧苦的緣故。那時，我還只有十幾歲，自己除了在商店中做應做的職務外，偸空讀點書，雖然沒有先生和朋友指導我，但我總覺得讀書有益，不管懂和不懂，我只是勤奮的讀，終於我稍稍能够看一點書了。這時候，我自己很明白要想發展將來，第一着就是在求知識，所以我讀書很勤，曾經因爲在夜裏讀書，受老　的訓斥，並且還生過幾决大病。有一個機會來了，是親戚介紹我到書店裏做校對，那時我是多麽的歡喜，當然，校對是一件很苦的事，可是我總是忍着苦繼續工作，我做這校對職務受到了不少的智識，看了不少的書，這時，我對於學問，方纔算有些正式的門徑了。在職務空閒的時候，我也做些詩詞和論文去投稿，有歲篇登了出來，因此，我更努力的寫作，幾十年來，一直沒有間斷。後來我常過書局裏的編輯，做過小學敎員和中學教員，也做過大學敎員和一省的行政長官，此後，我決意不要做官，因爲做官是要昧良心的，所以我遝是寫寫文章，敎敎書，比較還不失我的本性。」</p>
<p>把上面的話，我們仔細去想一想，可以看出這位湖老師，是從貧窮裏奮鬥出來，那種刻苦的精神，値得使人來欽佩的！</p>
<p>總說胡老師最近任着「民國日報」的主筆，他每天從早晨八時起，一直工作到晚八時，這種老當益壯的精神，青年人對之作何感想？</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>轉過屛風，這兩個濃妝少女，把一張精緻竹帘打了起來。鶴見跨上兩層階級，乍一進門，看見裏面又是一對艷服少女，左右一邊一個，早已伏在地上，簡直不想起來的探子。所謂艷服者，鶴見這時才看淸楚，原來竟三分之二的宮裝禮服；因爲近衛沾着幾分貴族血統，所以喜歡鬧點「皇家」風味。要不是夜已過午，地點又靠近海邊，氣候十分凉爽·像這樣三伏天氣，呌這些女人，裝上一大身長袍短套，背上還馱着偌大一個包袱，豈不罪過？</p>
<p>這是十分寬闊的一間廣室，只嫌太低一些，全室除掉電燈電扇之外，大槪全是日本風味的點綴；正而靠　當中，是一個巨型圓門？上下四角，裝有極精美的雕花格子，顏色十分淡雅，門楣正中、縣有三四尺寬的一塊横幅，有些像中國郞中的掛區，又像店舖後進的招牌；横幅上面，一手非行非草的擘窠大字，「武運修長」，　是寫　龍飛鳳舞，僅僅可惜有些濁氣。圓花門兩旁，掛着一幅對聯·却是侵略大陸首兇，伊籐博文最得意的兩句五言：「醉枕美人膝」，「醒握天下權」！圓門裏面一丈多深處，又是一架六扇的大屛風，上面是日出圖的山水人物。</p>
<p>這回門之內，屛風之前，有一張倣古的横榻矮足床，床前有幾件茶几之類的東西。靠近榻床的一隻茶儿上，放着像外國洋囝囝玩具似的一套酒器，酒壺並不是壺，乃是一隻倣古花瓶式的東西，那酒杯小得只够半口不足。榻的左右，跪着又是一對靑年女人，當然塗抹得紅是紅，白是白，黑是黑——紅的是胭脂，白的是鉛粉，黑的是那雙濃眉，和一個高高在上的髮髻。細兩個女人，一個，　　　　一個弄着五　　，</p>
<p>床上面，　　半　　　　　　　上，躺着一個五十多歲的男子，穿着家　和服，十分寬博，十分古化；一手把着一本　裝古書，那書足有一尺五寸那尺五寸那們長，另一隻手，却是擎着那種玩具式的小酒杯，這就是那發動侵略大陸戰爭的禍首近衛，這時躺在那裏，倒是十二分在摹倣着古畫上「雅人深致」，「名士風流」，的樣子。據說他的國家大計，都是在這種狀態下揣摩出來的。</p>
<p>鶴見進了這重門，那陪伴着，或是說，押解着他進來的人，只輕輕對門外兩個女人嘰咕了一兩句，輕手輕脚的溜走了。那室內地上爬着不起來的兩個女子，直到鶴見到了她們身邊，才抬起半個頭來，偸偷覷了鶴見一眼，速連叩了三四個頭，方站了起來，一邊一個，側着身子，傴僂着，跟在鶴見後而走着。</p>
<p>從門口這裏走到回門，也有這麼二三丈，鶴見一路走着，却是毫無脚步聲音，因他現在皮鞋已被脫去，只賸下一雙襪子，那兩個女人，穿的都是軟木底的「基答」，而且他這裏並不像普通人民舖的榻榻米，却是在榻榻米之上，還舖着台灣龍草織成的蓆毯，按照全室的大小，織成　大張，有各色圖案花紋，這樣熟天，走在上面，兩隻脚底倒是軟軟凉凉地，覺得異常舒服，當然沒有步聲發出。</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>抗戰沒有勝利之前，民國卅三年在重慶，關於國都所在地這個問題，曾經大爲熱鬧過，專家，學者，論客，敎授，偉言讜論，連篇累牘地充滿於各日報各雜誌上，且有出版社彙集了各家的巨著，輯爲國都問題專集印行。</p>
<p>各人主張不一，濟南，西安，長春，南京，北平漢口，長沙，甚至洛陽；各種主張都言之成理，自有千秋，結果誰也不承認別人的主張對。</p>
<p>不到兩年後的今天，在南京的國民大會會塲上又提出這個問題來熱烈討論了。</p>
<p>對於這一問題該有個前提；假使我是某地人，爲　某地的利益，而力爭應定都於某地，動機就不十分糾正，無論如何是不能作爲我們老慮的資料的。因爲，地方利益，地方觀念，不應該滲雜在討論這一問題中。</p>
<p>政治的（對內對外）和經濟的意義，將是決定這一問題的主要因素，同時恐怕還要顧及交通·人口，氣候，文化，等等條件。至於在憲章巾加以明文規定，那也恐怕不是必要的罷！</p>
<h3 id="c182">剩餘物資，許許運來。個中道理簡單　何必焦慮 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 革之</p>
<p>經濟學上的供求定律也這樣講：供多求少，則價格低，反之供少求多，則價格高。凡是稍懂得買賣的人，都曉得這個道理。</p>
<p>報載琉球有大量軍需剩餘物資，任其在倉庫中朽腐。這些物資，如果屬於人家所有，人家國富物豐，而且早已準備消耗於對敵作戰，這區區之數量，倒不在乎！吾人除對之表示羨慕與惋惜外，尙有何爲？可是這段新聞繼續讀下去時，『該項物資已售與中國國民政府』，一字字呈現眼前，始恍然明白這些東西的所有權己經買賣手續移轉咱們政府了。代價是美金五萬萬元。自成交以後，迄今仍未淸運完竣。</p>
<p>從價格和運輸上看，可想見這些物資的數量並不『罕』了。設能全部搬回，加強市塲供應，當然可以做一個美妙而富有意義的買賣。</p>
<p>這些人家剩餘的東西，旣然證明確係咱們所有，現在白白讓其在太平洋一個島上逐漸朽腐，反觀國內民窮物匱，工商凋零，於是乎，有人憤憤然大發牢騷，指貢當局庸弱無能。對於持有這種態度的人，我敢斷定他們一定也不懂做買賣的秘訣。一個月以前，本市克寗奶粉每磅漲價至一萬元，現在則五千四百元即可買到，音貴今賤，其中道理，不外乎供求律在作崇！咱們當局經過熟思精慮，慨然拿出這筆九個數字的美鈔款子購進這批貨物，主要目的在轉手配售，藉以抵制通貨膨脹。明白一點說，當局希望在轉手之間賺些錢，以資帮補帮補國庫，俾得少印發一些鈔票。當然錢愈賺得多愈妙，至若如何以貨易幣，如何以少換多，第一要懂得買賣的道理；第二要善察市塲的變化。這些散佈太平洋島嶼上爲咱們國家所有的東西，當局何嘗不想立刻派遣數十以至數百的船隻，乘風破浪，一口氣統統搬回來？何嘗不想一口氣全部脫手，以資週轉週轉？若萬一銷路欠佳，何嘗不想囤之倉庫，以待善價血沽？可是這僅僅是一個希望而已而已！吾人大發牢騷，指責當局，其原因即在此乎？誠然，物資隨其腐爛，的是一種損失。但我們就因這次買賣有虧蝕之虞而感失望嗎？曰：毋必！毋必！損失者，物資的數量而己。對於成本則毫無影響也。何以言之？本年二月間，中等襯衣一件，價値不過五六千元，現在則非萬元以上不可得同樣貨色。就是說今日之一件可抵往日之兩件矣。這次我國所購進的物資，設其數量共有一千萬件，同時這次因非人力所能防止而損失者，設其爲五百萬件。那麽實際到手只有其一半的五百萬件。依照對買賣外行的人的想法，東西一千萬件，成木五萬萬，今損其半，似乎眞要吃虧二萬五千萬了！然依照前述襯衣的實例，過上半年幾個月，市上缺貨，看準機會，一收一縱，一件當兩件，豈不是輕而且易撈回了血本嗎？說不定還要賺上若干利錢！主持這趙買賣的常局，一定比我們更了解供求定律，縱使這些物資朽腐了一些，少遝回了一些，又有何要緊！我們祇要對當局默示信仰，實際用不着作不必要的担心，抱莫須有的悲觀！如有不信，試拭目以待他日，便知吾言之不出所料也。報導這項消息的記者還說：至目前爲止，祇有一船貨運至中國。道位記者先生恐也不是一個買賣內行人！</p>
<p>人總是往壞的方面去猜想。或有人以爲我國已定購的東西，當不祇琉球島一地。其他各處的情形，是否已和琉島一樣，則不可而知。這種顧慮，我也認爲大可不必。加重語氣說，萬一全部爛光了，祇望能剩下一件，即能濟事有餘。這一件餘殘賤品，從一千萬件裏經自然淘汰而保留下來，自然變爲物之罕者了！不妨由當局珍藏起來，經過一段適當時間，然後配售與吾人，此時也，此絕無僅有的稀世寄珍，必爲全國四萬萬五千萬同咆，爭相競購，轟動一時，誰敢保證其中沒有熱心人士，慷而慨之，出價五萬萬美元搶購而歸？彼時之美金五萬萬亦今日之美鈔五億耳，數目無减，又何傷焉？更之當局只須派一飛機一大員前往押運，事至簡也，費用至省也，運費省，亦買賣獲利之至高原則也。我們又何必爲着剩餘物資的運輸問題而焦急憂慮呢？</p>

<p>— 叔孫如瑩</p>
<p>從馬克斯起，一直到今日解放區的幹部們，都有這麽一個觀念：窮人由於被剝削而窮，富人由於剝削人而富。這種觀念自然不無其理論與邏輯，但至少在中國，貧與富的原因決不如此簡單。</p>
<p>且引三句俗諺</p>
<p>一代富，手忙脚不住；</p>
<p>二代富，挺腰大凸肚；</p>
<p>三代富，拆屋賣樑柱。這是人民的語言，大槪絕對不是布爾喬亞的文學家所能產生的創作。這俗諺提示了貧富循環一的現象，和貧富變化的原因，深能促人猛省。</p>
<p>創業者莫不是勞動階級，惟其貧困，才能惕勵奮發，努力生產，躋入富有之境。靠遺產享福的，能安然守成的雖然不是沒有，而大多數闊人子弟寞不奢靡浪費，終至傾家蕩產，淪入乞丐之羣。</p>
<p>哈同與羅迦陵在當初原爲無產階級，但他們終於置了無數產業，成爲鉅富。他們的致富，上海灘的繁榮固然是一大原因，而他們的克勤克儉，也決不能加以抹煞的。再瞧他們的繼承人吧，除了打官司搶家產而外還能做些什麽呢？而且，這班享先人福的人又能享福到幾時呢？</p>
<p>富者不常富，貧者不常貧。受一份辛苦，得一份享受。在任何世界里——不論是資本主義的或社會主義的世界里——這在原則上的相差都很有限。</p>
<p>極端的資本主義世界裏，當然會貧者愈貧，富者愈富，但在中國眞正是大貧小貧；目今更是大家都活不下了。我們的問題只是：和平，統一，把一切上軌道。像廿六年前一二年的樣子，很有希望。鬥爭云云，是投機者的「技巧」！</p>

<p>— &lt;梁玉樞Z]　　平日被譽爲「布衣將軍」之×××氏，今在舊金山也已買起洋房汽車來矣。天下事，就是這麼一套。遠近有別  井天　　某記者言：「大槪距離「解放區」愈遠的人，也愈同情共產黨，愈近則反是，昆明和天津就相差多了。」這話祇要稍微一想，就覺得確含幾分至理。上海橫斷面叫花子的組織  黃嘉謨　　　　喜事，乃是總稱計分爲娶親，嫁女，做壽，瀰月宴等。丐頭已偵知喜事類別，定某日在何處舉行宴會。爺叔輩使事先沐浴更衣，準備喜嶂紅燭，前往見喜家賬房，連聲恭喜，賬房見是該轄境的丐頭，便也不留難地給賞打發。賞錢的數目酌量情形給發，在戰前，的在大洋一元至五元之間。戰後却需五千元至數萬元不等。至於丐流所送來的禮物，向例退還不收。大有「鼎惠懇辭」之慨。反正彼此心照不宜，丐帮的禮物賞將留爲後用的。但是做　和瀰月宴的資往往較婚　還要優厚。因爲婚事是家家非辦不可的。做壽瀰月却是富貴人家的多餘的舖張。前者是必需品·後者却無異奢侈品了。又因爲孝子孝孫們爲長輩稱壽，都不願乞丐們登門呌囂，口出不吉之辭，以破壞周遭的喜氣丐流們對此種種硏究有素，自可以擇肥而噬了。　　丐頭得賞稱謝謝後，便黏貼紅紙條在大門上，上面寫着：　　「貴府喜事，衆弟兄不得騷擾！」　　這一張「百無禁忌」的字條，果然像姜太公的靈符一樣，衆丐見了無不退避三舍。如果不給賞，那麽丐流便紛紛先後登門，便感到不勝其煩了。　　喪事　　喪事又分爲三種：一爲開弔，二爲出喪，三爲做忌辰。中國住戶多半沿用佛敎禮式，免不了做佛事誦經。當戶尤其喜歡舖張。丐頭逢此時會，不免穿着素服，準備香燭前來拜見賬房。做出弔喪的模樣，祝福死者早登天界。喪家帳房仍須給錢打發，但其數量目比喜事爲少。近來上海殯儀館盛興，丐流登門頗感不便。因爲殯儀館向來有門衛，其間頗多阻難；丐流不得其門而入，往往轉向喪家的住宅去苦苦哀求。但若喪家是因不幸的横死，如自殺或被殺等，丐流也祇好斟酌情勢，不再登門索錢了，例如最近某大漢奸遭槍決開弔，該地段的丐頭也居然不屑一顧。這是老弟兄丐帮的聰明處。　　在從前，丐流還準備着三牲祭禮與富戶弔喪，藉以索取更可觀的賞錢。喪家對祭禮當然不收，因爲丐流是向猪肉店租來一用的，這已變成一種公開秘密了。三毛  張樂平</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The ninth general assembly of the National Assembly was held at 9:40 AM on the morning of the 5th. 1,165 representatives were in attendance, and chaired by Zhang Ji, representatives continued to express their opinions extensively.

<h3 id="e3">Shao Lizi Expresses His Opinion: The Constitution Draft Must Conform to the Five-Power Constitution; All Parties Hope to Abandon Preconceived Notions <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The ninth general assembly of the National Assembly was held in the morning. The speeches of the representatives are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yao Qinru: This constitution draft has been revised based on the opinions of all parties and can be said to have been carefully considered. However, the provisions related to the welfare of the people are still too brief, especially regarding the two points of economy and education, which have not been fully enumerated. There are only five articles related to the economy and only three related to education in the entire constitution draft, which is inevitably a case of missing the forest for the trees. I believe that the development of the economic system, the development of educational goals and systems, and the relief of out-of-school youth and children should all be included in the constitution. The founding father once said: "The first priority of construction is the national economy and the people's livelihood. If education is not cultivated, there is no point in talking about people's livelihood." Therefore, basic national policies for economy and education should be stipulated in detail in separate chapters to ensure long-term stability and prosperity of the country.</p>
<p>Lin Li: The representatives have rarely expressed their opinions on the two points of nationalization of the military and democratization of politics. I would like to briefly express my views on the basic national policy: the so-called national defense must also include the nationalization of the military. I would like to briefly outline it as follows: (1) Civilian and military separation, which is stipulated in Articles 134, (2) Separation of the military from political parties, (3) Conscription system, (4) Security for the appointment and removal of military officers, (5) In the current atomic age, attention should be paid to scientific national defense.</p>
<p>Huang Zhengqing: According to Article 5 of Chapter 1, which stipulates that all ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal, the so-called equality should naturally include rights and obligations, so that they have equal opportunities. However, the constitution draft still fails to broadly include the status and rights of ethnic minorities in the border areas, which is a pity. The Tibet mentioned therein usually refers to Rear Tibet. In fact, the provinces of Sichuan, Qinghai, and Kang also have Tibetan populations totaling more than four million. They have their own types of culture, economy, belief, and habits. However, the constitution draft does not clearly stipulate provisions for the border residents scattered outside Tibet. Moreover, within the so-called Tibetan region, they cannot compete with other ethnic groups in the provinces concerned. Therefore, if the constitution draft does not clearly stipulate the national assembly representatives they should elect, their rights will undoubtedly be deprived. Sun Yat-sen said in the Outline of National Construction: "We should support all small ethnic groups in the country so that they can self-determine and self-govern." Based on the above reasons, we cannot allow the rights of the Tibetan people, who occupy such a vast area of the country, to be ignored, and hope that the constitution will not have this shortcoming.</p>
<p>Wu Chunwu: A perfect constitution must stipulate the welfare regulations related to the people. We should observe two phenomena in the current society: (1) widespread corruption, and (2) continuous soaring prices. I believe that the reason lies in the lack of restrictions on private property, the national property is declining, and private individuals are generally poor and corrupt. Therefore, I believe that private property must be restricted so that the state can effectively implement capital control and equalization of land ownership.</p>
<p>Li Zonghuang: In this constitution draft, regarding the chapter on the provincial and county systems, I believe that the power of the province is too high and the power of the county is lowered, which should be remedied. The method can stipulate that the county and city are autonomous units, with the county as the main body of autonomy. Conversely, the province is not an autonomous unit, nor is it the main body of autonomy. This provision can stabilize the national politics, and the constitution will not fail.</p>
<p>Shao Lizi: I have many thoughts, but I am not sure whether I can finish speaking due to time constraints:</p>
<p>(1) I advocate supporting the system and spirit of the Five-Power Constitution. This is a basic principle that cannot be violated. The spirit of the Five-Power Constitution that the Premier said lies in the division of powers and functions. What the people hope for is an omnipotent government, but it cannot be achieved suddenly and must have certain conditions. The United States has a presidential system, the United Kingdom has a cabinet system, and France also has a presidential system, but it is different from the United States. Therefore, although they are all three-power systems, they have mutual differences. Our constitution is naturally different from the three powers. I participated in the CPPCC and the Constitution Draft Review Committee and felt that the success of the Premier's doctrine, that is, the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, cannot be separated. During the discussion of the constitution draft, if you have good opinions, you can also modify it, but it must be made to conform to the Five-Power Constitution.</p>
<p>(2) Many representatives emphasized that the interests of the people should be above those of the parties. You should know that the parties are not outside the people. I represent the Kuomintang and say that the Kuomintang has not left the people, nor has it deviated from the scope of the people. The Premier said, "Pioneers for the people." The Kuomintang is the pioneer for the people and, of course, cannot deviate from the people. Other parties are also within the scope of the people and should also be the pioneers for the people. We respect our own party and also respect other parties. I hope that everyone will abandon preconceived notions. The more restrictions on parties in the constitution draft, the more inappropriate it is. During the CPPCC meeting, all parties abandoned their own prejudices for the interests of the people. I hope that this discussion of the constitution draft, regardless of which unit each representative comes from, can also consider the wishes of the people.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the section on basic national policies, I absolutely agree with the foreign affairs part. What we need is independent and autonomous diplomacy. Regarding the United Nations Charter, some people think that it must be deleted. I think it is unnecessary because it is the lofty ideal of the late President Roosevelt of the United States, and our country's leaders also signed it. We don't have to think of it as temporary. We should support it and make other countries in the world support it as well.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding elections, if a general election is conducted, those who have not participated in the public office candidate examination cannot participate. According to our country's social customs, it will make many virtuous people give up their right to vote and be elected because they are unwilling to participate in the exam. This seems to be a loss. According to the constitution, the test committee should be elected by the people. Candidates for public office in various counties have not yet been produced, so where does the Examination Yuan come from? Therefore, we can only wait for the future on this matter and hope that the representatives will seriously consider it.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Minister Peng Announces at Reception: National Government Executive Yuan to be Reorganized; Figures from All Parties Expected to Participate <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department announced at a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters on the afternoon of the 5th that the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan will be reorganized in the near future, and party leaders and non-party figures are expected to participate. Peng made this statement in response to a reporter's question: "There have been rumors recently that the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan will be reorganized. What stage has this reached? Will all parties participate?" In addition, there are other important questions and answers as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What is the military and political situation in Dalian and Lushun? Does the Chinese Navy intend to enter Lushun? Has the National Army entered Dalian? Can the minister give us details?</p>
<p>Answer: Recent reports in various newspapers that the National Army is advancing to Dalian and the Navy is heading to Lushun are not true.</p>
<p>Question: Where is Okamura Yasuji now? Today's repatriation is over. Is he still serving the government?</p>
<p>Answer: Okamura is still assisting in the repatriation of Japanese nationals and prisoners of war who have not yet been sent back as a liaison officer because there are still some Japanese nationals and technical personnel retained in China, and some Japanese war criminals who have been acquitted should also be repatriated. There are still some Japanese prisoners of war in the Communist area.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The issue of the reorganization of the National Government has not yet surfaced because it is currently busy with constitution-making, but the government is preparing to proceed. As for the Social Democratic Party's participation in the government, according to its consistent statement, it prioritizes constitution-making and then participation in the government. There has been no change at present. It is reported that Li Daming, one of the leaders of the party, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and will come to Nanjing soon to attend the National Assembly. The government will invite him to discuss the reorganization of the government. Jiang Yuntian went to Shanghai by night train on the 5th and will return to Nanjing in a few days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] It was recently learned from reliable sources that the Xinjiang representatives did not submit any written proposals to the government, and will not do so in the near future. The rumors are not credible.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Li Zongren Recuperating in Nanjing; Rumors of Resignation Completely Untrue <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the rumors from Beiping, Xiao Yishan, Secretary-General of the Parallel Executive Headquarters, told a Central News Agency reporter that the rumors were completely untrue. Director Li has been recuperating for the past two days due to a recurrence of stomach problems, which prevented him from attending the National Assembly. He will fly to Beiping as soon as his health recovers.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Liu Chunyi's Funeral; Madame Chiang Presides <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The remains of Liu Chunyi, a female representative to the National Assembly, were buried at the China Funeral Home at 2:00 PM on the 5th. Hundreds of representatives attended. Madame Chiang personally presided over the ceremony, with Yu Youren and others accompanying her. Madame Chiang looked sorrowful, and many female representatives wept.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Review of Representative Qualifications; Three Methods Decided; Review Began in Nineteen Groups Yesterday <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The National Assembly Representative Qualification Review Committee reviewed the qualifications in nineteen groups in the Second Rest Room of the National Assembly Hall at 8:30 PM this afternoon. Representative Zhang Lisheng, the convener, reported three review methods: (1) Representatives who have not submitted their election certificates should be notified by the Secretariat to submit them. (2) If the election certificate is lost, two representatives from the same unit should be asked to prove it. (3) Selected representatives and representatives from various parties should ask the Election General Office to prove their qualifications. The groups then began the review, which lasted two hours. As a result, it was found that a majority of representatives had not renewed their election certificates, and they were notified to submit them separately.</p>
<h3 id="e8">"Peace Elder" Well Received; Gleanings from the Ninth National Assembly <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Ming</p>
<p>Peace Elder Shao Lizi's seat number is 456, a very auspicious number. He had been silent since the meeting began, but on the afternoon of the 5th, he finally got the opportunity. As soon as he walked onto the platform, applause burst out below.</p>
<p>The Peace Elder began with an introduction, saying: "I have many thoughts, but I am afraid that I will not be able to finish speaking due to time constraints. I am not sure." But it was too long after all. Chairman Zhang Ji repeatedly rang the bell, but the ringing of the bell was the law, and his face was smiling, which was not without human touch. So the Peace Elder asked to continue speaking and asked, "Is it okay?" Old Zhang did not answer, but applause burst out from below like a string of firecrackers, and people shouted "Good!"</p>
<p>Old Kong Geng ran onto the stage during the speech of a certain representative, tilted his head and wrote on the table. After a while, he realized that it was a poem he had written last night after listening to the speeches of the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party. It is now recorded as follows: "The Youth and Social Democrats speak like rivers, the Youth Party's voices are particularly loud, the only great view is the theory of power and ability, the Founding Father's last words (omitted), the national anthem." Below is signed "Occasional feeling on the pillow."</p>
<p>There are too few reporter seats, and some reporters were squeezed out. They had no choice but to sit in the representative seats. Someone joked: "Reporters are obviously one level higher than representatives because reporters were squeezed out of their seats and became representatives."</p>
<p>A certain delegation left its seat for a while and did not receive the documents that should have been received. They were very angry and called the staff in the venue. However, there were too few staff members to be assigned. A certain representative immediately slapped the table and accused them. A certain staff member said very politely, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry." Fortunately, the "case" was not a public case, so the slap was not loud.</p>
<p>For the issue of "stopping extensive discussions," Zhang used lightning-fast methods and immediately put it to a vote. Although some people shouted that they did not hear it, the voting machines already had points of light.</p>
<p>A certain representative did not call him, so he walked onto the podium by himself, but did not speak. The chairman was already processing other issues. In the end, he did not get an order and walked down alone. The reporter said that this is autonomy, self-government, and self-awareness. He went up by himself, did not speak on his own, and consciously walked down the stage.</p>
<p>The female representative Liu Chunyi died, and Chiang Soong Mei-ling, as a female representative, also sent a wreath.</p>
<p>Some people are keeping records of the actions of the "National Assembly Flower," such as yesterday's hair was combed into oil curls, today's hair is combed into oily strips, the coat started wearing white, now it is black, and they are frequently studying her words and deeds. Each representative's special fee is 500,000 national currency, which is issued early in the morning. The representatives rush to receive it. They are all brand new linked bills. Someone asked what level the month's currency had depreciated to. Yu Huizi arrived early and requested Bao's calligraphy. He wrote very quickly. Those who requested included representatives, reporters, and staff in the venue. Everyone was happy.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Hu Shih Says "Will Never Form a Party" and Has Not Learned "White House Techniques" <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Hu Shih solemnly denied at a press conference at the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 5th that he would form a party and declared that he did not intend to publish magazines in the short term. Hu did not avoid answering the above two questions. After the reporter who raised the question asked again, he said: "I, Hu Shih, will never run a party. You can believe that my interests are now mostly in non-political aspects, in other words, in academic aspects. I have no intention of running a party, nor do I have the time to form a party." As for whether "Independent Review" will be republished or whether other magazines will be published, Hu replied: After the September 18th Incident, I gathered twelve like-minded people and raised 5,000 yuan to run an Independent Review, which was published for five years and published 1,400 manuscripts without paying a penny of manuscript fees. It can be said that it has achieved true "independence." However, in today's world, independence is not easy because the professors who write the articles are now very poor, and they care about every grain of rice. It is impossible to give a small manuscript without paying. In addition, the current paper costs and printing costs are very expensive. After considering various aspects, I have no intention of starting a magazine.</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Shih, a member of the National Assembly Presidium, publicly received Chinese and foreign reporters at the invitation of Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 5th. The reception was held in the exhibition room of Chen Shuren's painting exhibition at the Public Friendship Association. Some men and women who visited the painting exhibition admired Hu's reputation and stood around to watch, all wanting to see Hu's demeanor.</p>
<p>At the reception, Hu first said that his wife had lived in Washington for four years, but unfortunately, she did not have the opportunity to participate in the bi-weekly press conferences held at the White House, so she had never learned the "techniques" to deal with it. Today, he met with reporters as "a student studying the constitution draft." (December 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Era of Flying Fortresses and Atomic Bombs; Location of National Capital Has No North or South; Hu Shih Says Constitution Draft Can Be Passed Smoothly <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Hu Shih, one of the members of the National Assembly Presidium, attended a press conference at the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 5th and answered various questions about the constitution draft and the National Assembly. His remarks, both solemn and humorous, won a lot of laughter from more than 200 Chinese and foreign reporters. After Minister Peng gave a brief introduction, Hu stood up and made a humble self-introduction, saying that he was willing to answer questions based on what he knew at today's press conference, but because he had not participated in the CPPCC and the subsequent Constitution Draft Review Committee, he only answered questions as a student studying the constitution. Someone specifically mentioned that National Government Chairman Chiang gave him a constitution draft at the National Assembly. In fact, this was only a historical coincidence because he was the chairman that day and there was no deep meaning. When answering questions, Hu said that it was difficult to say what kind of decision the National Assembly would make on the constitution draft in the end. In his personal opinion, the constitution draft was generally expected to be passed and there would not be any major or fundamental revisions. Judging from the mood of the assembly in recent days, it can be seen that the participants oppose any control or restraint. The assembly has the power and will be more perfect. However, if analyzed calmly, it can be seen that this constitution draft is generally reasonable and modern. It is the result of a long period of discussion by parties and non-party figures, so there will not be any fundamental changes. Someone asked during the assembly's extensive discussions that some representatives believed that this constitution draft was a party's constitution and not a people's constitution. Hu said, this question can be answered by Mr. Shao Lizi's speech at the National Assembly this morning. Shao said that because this constitution draft was drafted by all parties, it cannot be said to be the constitution of one party, but is a true representative of the people's interests. This point is very correct. Regarding the position of the Legislative and Supervisory Committee as representatives of the National Assembly, Hu also believes that the two should not be national assembly representatives at the same time, and believes that this provision may be deleted in the future. Regarding the issue of the national capital, Hu believes that in this era of flying fortresses and atomic bombs, any location can be the national capital and is not suitable as the national capital. Historical views no longer apply today. When a reporter asked where Hu would support when the National Assembly voted on where the capital should be located, Hu, holding the constitution draft, replied in a humorous tone that according to Article 128, voting should be conducted by secret ballot. Therefore, I have the right not to tell you. After speaking, everyone laughed. A reporter mentioned that some representatives believed that there was too much capitalism in the constitution draft. Hu did not think so. He pointed out that in the five articles from Article 138 to 142 of the Basic National Policy, only the first half of "141" "The state should protect private wealth and private enterprises" can refer to this statement, but the other four and a half articles can be said to be socialist thought. In fact, even the Communist Party does not deny the need to protect private wealth, so it cannot be said that there is too much capitalism. Regarding the assembly's schedule, Hu believes that if it cannot be concluded after being extended to December 19, it may be extended again. When the assembly will reopen depends on the review situation. If one or two groups have completed the review, the assembly can be convened. He believes that the chapter on people's rights and obligations has fewer problems. After review, it may be submitted to the assembly for a public decision immediately. As for the fact that the review meeting will be held in secret and reporters cannot participate, on the one hand, it is because there are too few houses and it is difficult to accommodate everyone, and on the other hand, it is because of this. Later participants can specifically discuss and carefully consider the articles so as not to compete with each other in order to gain the attention of the audience. He cited the non-publicity of the Philadelphia Constitution Conference in the United States as an example.</p>

Observers believe that, according to President Truman's recent statement, Special Envoy Marshall may not return to his country for the time being.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 5th] Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng told our reporter today that peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will not resume immediately because the resumption of talks depends on the disputing parties. It is reported that the Communist Party recently demanded the dissolution of the National Assembly, which is absolutely unacceptable to the government.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Kirk Arrives in Shanghai and Announces to Reporters: 4,000 American Troops to Withdraw Soon; Five U.S. Senators Arrive in Shanghai This Afternoon <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Admiral Kirk, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Qingdao. At 4 p.m., he hosted a reception for reporters at the Cathay Hotel, stating that approximately 4,000 U.S. Marines from the Seventh Regiment and Navy personnel stationed along the railway line and coal mining areas from Qinhuangdao to Tianjin and Tanggu to Beidaihe would withdraw back to the United States in the near future. The number of Marines remaining in China and the question of their stay will be discussed in its entirety at the United Nations Security Council and will be announced by the council in the future.</p>
<p>The U.S. established a consulate in Dalian several months ago, protected by the U.S. Navy, but communication there was poor. On November 20, Admiral Kirk led several consulate staff members on a small landing craft, carrying supplies and communication equipment for the consulate staff. He stayed there for less than two days and paid a return visit to Soviet Brigadier General Zogov. A reporter asked whether Zogov's presence in Dalian proved that Soviet troops were stationed there. Admiral Kirk replied, "There are some troops there." Kirk also said, "I don't believe Dalian is currently under the control of the Chinese Communists, but depending on the situation, it may be under Soviet control." There are currently about 5,000 Japanese troops in Dalian awaiting repatriation, and ships will be dispatched from General MacArthur's headquarters in Japan to transport them.</p>
<p>Admiral Kirk also reported that the U.S. Marines and local Americans in Qingdao jointly run a small school that admits not only the children of U.S. military families, but also children from other countries. There are a total of 160 students, about half of whom are American, and 11 are Chinese. There are also children from more than ten other countries, including England, the Soviet Union, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Korea. The school has an excellent organization, with a self-elected student council chairman, and publishes a school newspaper. Each person pays US$20 per month. The school has now been expanded into a middle school. Marshal Marshall and others recently visited the school and praised it highly.</p>
<p>Kirk also said that five U.S. Senators, including Isak, Brewster, Brewster, Hurley, and Mansfield, will arrive in Shanghai at 11:30 a.m. today for a two-day stay and will host a reception for reporters this afternoon.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Foreign Ministry spokesman Ye Gongchao announced at a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters this afternoon that after the Shenzhen incident, we sent a letter and telegram to our embassy in the UK, and negotiated with the British embassy here at 8:30 last night. At the same time, the British government in the area has also instructed the garrison to apologize to us, and the two sides are currently negotiating compensation issues. The facts are not yet very clear, and an investigation of the relevant facts is underway to determine countermeasures.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] At today's afternoon press conference, a reporter asked about the undemarcated Yunnan-Burma border and the South African federal government's land policy discriminating against overseas Chinese. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ye Gongchao answered that there are two sections of the undemarcated Yunnan-Burma border. In the southern section, China and the UK exchanged notes on June 18, 1941, to determine the longitude and latitude, but boundary markers have not yet been erected. In the northern section, the two countries have not discussed the border line in detail. Regarding the undemarcated border, the two countries had initial discussions before the outbreak of the Pacific War, but these were stopped after the Pearl Harbor incident. Regarding the South African land policy, our country attaches great importance to it. In principle, our government opposes any racial discrimination, and this policy has caused our overseas Chinese residing there to suffer economic oppression. Therefore, we have repeatedly instructed our Consul General in Cape Town, South Africa, to make representations on this matter. However, we are only concerned with the aspects of the policy that affect our overseas Chinese, and we have no opinion on the aspects of the policy that involve South Africa's internal affairs.</p>

<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 5th] Bowers, head of the British trade delegation to China, told our reporter today that Britain hopes to purchase large quantities of soybeans from the nine eastern provinces of China to manufacture margarine, which is in great demand in Britain. Once the port of Dalian is opened to international shipping, purchases can begin. The inflow of American goods into China does not affect British trade, for two reasons: (1) Britain does not have the capacity to supply a large batch of goods at this time, and (2) the Chinese market is vast and can accommodate trade from both the U.S. and Britain.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Negotiations between China and France on the implementation of the agreement on the Vietnam issue have actually been suspended for half a month. The main reason is not that the points of contention are difficult to discuss, but due to the political changes in France.

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] The Central Extraordinary Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a lead-printed "Letter to All Party Comrades on the Current Urgent Situation," advocating: (1) Immediately dismiss the external delegation led by Zhou Enlai and dominated by Mao Zedong's followers. (2) Each liberated area should elect cadres of all colors from anti-Mao Zedongist party, government, military, civilian, and academic circles as representatives to the National Assembly. (3) Reorganize party organizations at all levels to launch the struggle against Mao Zedongism, anti-warlordism, and anti-military opportunism and the revolution. (4) From bottom to top, strictly reorganize all existing troops and the people's armed forces in the liberated areas. The letter bitterly criticized Mao Zedong's bureaucratic leadership, which still makes the party's policies wander in the mire of opportunism, saying that Mao's fundamental mistake lies in misjudging the current revolutionary situation in China, so that narrow theories replace the revolutionary views of Marxism-Leninism. On the other hand, he overestimated his own armed forces. It also said: the excessive left-leaning tendency in land policy, the massacre of rich peasants, and the shaking of the middle peasants caused the masses in the liberated areas to disperse, objectively helping the Kuomintang's offensive against the liberated areas. In propaganda, the over-radical anti-American slogans were put forward, and they did not know how to win assistance but instead set up enemies everywhere. Therefore, the guiding ideology of Zedongism is a new Li San line that is more than enough to make.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th] A military strategist from outside Shanhaiguan said: Although the Communist troops have recently launched offensives in various places, their strength is very weak. After the Communist troops outside Shanhaiguan were driven to Northern Manchuria, they faced extreme difficulties in supplies, suffered from hunger and cold, competed with the people for food, and were unable to fight, let alone counterattack. As for the Communist troops inside Shanhaiguan, because ammunition cannot be replenished from outside Shanhaiguan, materials cannot be exchanged, and the original rich areas they occupied, as well as areas in Zhangjiakou, Huailai, and Eastern Shandong with mineral deposits and ordnance factory equipment, have all been recovered by the National troops and cannot be used. They now mostly use homemade weapons to fight, which is difficult to resist the National troops. The Communist troops fled to the barren mountains, separated from production, with no hope of resupply, and do not know how many years they will be displaced, so their military morale is wavering, and their resentment towards the war is increasing. The number of people who bring weapons back to the National troops to surrender is increasing day by day. The Communist Party's long-term rebellion plan is probably impossible in modern tactics.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hankou, 5th] Huang Zaixing, a senior cadre of the former Communist troop Luo Houfu, recently announced his surrender and has been sent back to his hometown by the government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 5th] Military news: the CCP Central Committee recently decided on three new policies in view of the deteriorating military situation: (1) In terms of personnel, improve quality, strengthen red education, and encourage a fighting mentality. (2) In terms of military strategy, launch a nationwide military movement, implement guerrilla warfare, do not defend strongholds to the death, do not sacrifice in dead battles, and make full use of militia to preserve strength. (3) In terms of administration, expand the scope of settling accounts and turning over, firmly grasp the countryside, and lay the foundation for rural administration in each district.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Sheng Youwei, the "Opium King," was tried for the fourth time at the Capital High Court at 11 a.m. on the 5th, presided over by Judge Jin Shiding, still as an investigative court. Sheng Youwei, the renegade, had a smoking face and broken heels, a typical old gun. At the beginning of the trial, Sheng said that he was weak and sick and asked to sit for the trial, which was allowed by the court. When asked about the process of selling opium, Sheng completely denied it. When asked about his property, Sheng alone missed the gold tripods presented to him by various silver and money industries in Shanghai, which were his beloved things. He said with some emotion that they were taken away after the victory. He also put forward facts that were beneficial to him, saying that when the enemy invaded the Shanghai concession, he tried to ban the circulation of legal currency. He negotiated with the Japanese chiefs so that the concession could still be used. It is said that the legal currency of 176 million yuan in various banks in Shanghai was searched by the enemy and handed over to the Zhengjin Bank, and the banks pushed him to negotiate with the Japanese to get it back. The court asked in detail about the processes of his betrayal, affiliation, and drug trafficking. The interrogation was completed at 1 p.m. and he was returned to custody for another trial at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Sino-British Commercial Treaty and Hong Kong Kowloon <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The British commercial delegation has been in China for two months to investigate the actual situation in various places, which will greatly contribute to the promotion of trade between China and Britain. According to our newspaper's Nanjing telegram yesterday, we learned that the draft of the Sino-British commercial treaty has been submitted by the British Embassy in China, and negotiations are expected to begin soon. The people of the whole country have high hopes for this. It is generally believed that the relationship between China and Britain has always been close, and during the war, the two countries fought side by side and struggled together against aggression, and their friendship has been tempered by blood and become more solid. Therefore, after the end of the war, the Chinese people hoped that Britain would change its past imperialist approach to China and resolutely return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China in order to heal the rift between the people of the two countries and wipe out the stain on the diplomatic history of China and Britain. However, the British authorities have not yet made a clear statement on this matter, and their reluctance to let go is obvious, which has long caused deep dissatisfaction among the Chinese people. Recently, upon hearing the news that China and Britain are about to start commercial negotiations, everyone hopes that the government can raise the demand for the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon during the negotiation process. The Shanghai Municipal Council had already made a resolution on demanding the government to recover Hong Kong and Kowloon. In recent days, general public organizations have also sent telegrams to the diplomatic authorities to contribute their opinions, and some even advocate that the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon should be a prerequisite for the conclusion of a Sino-British commercial treaty.</p>
<p>At this time when the people of the whole country are expecting a new page in Sino-British relations, it is suddenly heard that British troops suddenly invaded Shenzhen from Kowloon, shooting and killing our compatriots, killing a villager on the spot. Although the government has lodged a strong protest with the Hong Kong authorities and has obtained a verbal apology from the Hong Kong Garrison Commander, the British army's act of infringing upon our country's territorial sovereignty and harming the lives of our people is indeed enough to arouse the anger of the Chinese people. Its impact will not only affect the future Sino-British relations, but also directly suffer its adverse impact on the upcoming Sino-British commercial treaty negotiations. British diplomats are known to the world for their long-term vision, but it is puzzling that they insist on clinging to Hong Kong and Kowloon, which are detrimental to Sino-British relations, and refuse to let go.</p>
<p>The unequal treaties previously signed between China and various countries began with the Treaty of Nanjing after the Opium War, and the cession of Hong Kong to Britain was the product of the Treaty of Nanjing. Therefore, our country's abolition of unequal treaties and the recovery of ceded lands and concessions should begin with the recovery of Hong Kong. In 1943, all unequal treaties between China and Britain were abolished, but the British government still refused to return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China, which has long caused deep dissatisfaction among the Chinese people. Even the great politicians and diplomats of various countries consider it unwise for Britain to adopt this attitude. According to the fact that during the war, the heads of state of China, Britain, and the United States met in Cairo to discuss the century-old plan for the Far East, they also unanimously agreed in principle to return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China. The late US President Roosevelt promised to uphold justice on this matter; however, after the end of the war, Britain still refused to let go, and American congressmen also criticized Britain for refusing to give up Hong Kong and Kowloon. The British authorities were forced to adopt a delaying policy and issued an ambiguous statement: "Once the time is ripe, negotiations will be held with China to discuss the return of Hong Kong." Therefore, the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue has become an outstanding issue between China and Britain.</p>
<p>The British government and the public have many complaints about the recently concluded Sino-American commercial treaty and are deeply anxious about the increasingly declining position of Britain in China. Therefore, they urgently hope that the Sino-British commercial treaty can be concluded as soon as possible. We can fully understand and sympathize with their distress and anxiety. Because post-war China needs peace and prosperity, it does not want to discriminate against or differentiate between any of the great powers, whether it is Britain, the United States, France, or the Soviet Union; and it is willing to conclude commercial treaties with various countries separately on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. However, we must also make the British government and the public understand our country's national aspirations for Hong Kong and Kowloon. Our newspaper editorials have repeatedly pointed out that the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon is the unanimous desire of our people. If Britain cannot satisfy our national aspirations, the stain on Sino-British relations cannot be wiped out, and there is no hope of turning a new page in the diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Leaving aside political reasons and considering economic factors, Britain should also return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China. The only goal of negotiating the Sino-British commercial treaty is to promote trade between China and Britain, but how to increase the volume of trade between the two countries? The first step is the economic recovery and prosperity of China. However, the special status of Hong Kong has always been a major obstacle to China's economic construction. To this day, it is still the source of smuggling, tax evasion, and foreign exchange evasion. In particular, including Hong Kong in the scope of foreign navigation will make it impossible for China's nascent shipping industry to ever rise. Therefore, if Britain does not return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China, Sino-British commercial negotiations will be impossible. The people of the whole country have such a view, and the wise diplomatic authorities will surely be able to see the advantages and disadvantages. Taking a step back, we are thinking about the British government, and Hong Kong and Kowloon should also be returned to China as soon as possible. Because as long as these two places are not returned to China, the rift between the people of China and Britain will not be healed, and misunderstandings and estrangement between the two countries will become deeper and deeper. Taking the situation in the past year as an example, in September this year, when our country established a government in Kowloon City, Hong Kong argued unreasonably and obstructed it, which aroused our country's protest. Last month, a tragic incident occurred in Hong Kong in which a policeman kicked and killed our compatriots, casting a shadow on the hearts of the Chinese people, who believe that today's British Labour government still maintains the imperialist style of the Conservative Party. Recently, British troops even crossed the border and shot and killed our compatriots, which has aroused the anger of the people of the whole country. Therefore, if Hong Kong and Kowloon are not returned to China, such unfortunate incidents will inevitably occur one after another, and the impact will not only prevent Sino-British relations from becoming closer, but also the feelings of the people of the two countries may deteriorate. We cannot help but worry about this.</p>
<p>Finally, we must once again say a word to the British government and the public: the decline of Britain's position in China is not due to competition among the great powers. Competition from other countries is not to be feared, but the most terrible thing is that Britain itself does not know how to eliminate the rift between the people of China and Britain. Britain clings to Hong Kong and Kowloon and refuses to let go, thinking that it is gaining an advantage. On the surface, it seems to be beneficial to Britain, but in reality, the price that Britain pays is unimaginable. Please, the wise Labour government, weigh the pros and cons and choose between Hong Kong and Kowloon and the Sino-British commercial treaty!</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] London, 5th Broadcast: Prime Minister Attlee, the Governor-General of India, Nehru, and Jinnah held separate talks today, but no results were achieved. Another round of talks are scheduled for tonight. According to well-informed sources, regardless of success or failure, Nehru is determined to fly back to India on Saturday. Relations between India and the Muslim League are not optimistic.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Today is one of the most important days for the talks between Indian leaders and British government officials. Although authorities in London are reluctant to disclose anything, according to the London correspondent of the New York Times, the talks have reached an impasse and there is no hope of success. The Indian Constituent Assembly is scheduled to open in New Delhi on Monday, but Jinnah still refuses to consider returning to the alliance, and Nehru is unwilling to make any concessions. The British side feels very discouraged about the situation in India. The date of the round table conference has not been announced to this day. London newspapers this morning carried a public speech by Nehru, stating that India's destiny should be decided by the Indians themselves; otherwise, there is no hope of solving all problems. Even well-intentioned interference from others will only make the situation more complicated. If there is outside interference, our attention will inevitably be diverted. Today, many Indians are unwilling to boldly face the facts that we must face, and they only seek help from outsiders. Therefore, the most important thing now is to make Indians understand that the real solution should be the responsibility of the Indians themselves, and if it fails, the consequences should also be borne by the Indians. Nehru also said that he will return to India in two or three days. What the results of this trip will be is still unknown. However, on this trip, he will see many old friends who are about to set off to return home. Tonight, Nehru will meet Professor Laski, a senior member of the Labor Party.</p>

All parties believe that the results of this talk will affect the success or failure of the Indian Constituent Assembly. The main point of discussion is whether the long-awaited round table conference can be convened. In other words, is there a willingness to cooperate among the Indian Muslim League, and Sikh leaders? However, as of noon, no formal announcement has been made as to when the round table conference will be held. The Indian Constituent Assembly is scheduled to be held next Monday. Deputy Prime Minister Nehru of the Indian Interim Government must rush back to New Delhi by then, but President Jinnah of the Muslim League may stay in London for a longer period.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Lewis Fined 10,000 Yuan, Protests Sentence, Determined to Appeal, Coal Supplies to France, Belgium, Italy, and Denmark Cut Off <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] Federal Court Judge Goldsborough ruled today that UMW President Lewis was in contempt of the court's strike injunction and fined him $10,000, but exempted him from imprisonment. The UMW was fined $3.5 million. Defense lawyers declared their dissatisfaction and filed an appeal. The judge denounced the anthracite coal strike as a "horrendous event." If this threat is realized, it will cause Americans to suffer hunger, cold, and poverty, overthrow their government, and replace it with dictatorship. If a choice must be made between destroying the union and maintaining the country, the country should be given priority. The judge then issued a preliminary injunction to the union and Lewis. If the strike does not end quickly, there is a possibility of heavier punishment.</p>
<p>Lewis glared angrily at the judge, his facial muscles twitching. Lewis must post bond tomorrow, and the $3.5 million fine will be paid in fourteen days, averaging $250,000 per day. When the judge announced the sentence, he advised Lewis not to defy the law again. The defense lawyer shouted that this was a "heinous and abnormal punishment." Lewis retorted angrily in court, accusing government lawyers of lying, and the judge warned him. As a result of the coal strike, at least six European countries have had their American coal supplies cut off. France, Belgium, Italy, Denmark, and Switzerland are the most affected. Sweden, Norway, and Germany reported that there were no signs of industrial stagnation, but it is expected that difficulties will also increase if the coal strike does not end quickly. British officials are closely monitoring the situation, fearing that the prolonged strike will jeopardize Britain's already scarce supply. In the United States, the number of unemployed workers has increased to 570,000, including 400,000 striking miners. After the railways ban freight transport, the total number of unemployed will jump to 2 million within a week or ten days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] The coal strike, with its disastrous consequences, has now entered its third week. Although the Federal Court has fined the UMW $3.5 million and threatened to re-prosecute Lewis and the UMW for contempt of the injunction and implement the Smith-Connally Act, the strike has been difficult to curb. Lewis is determined to suffer imprisonment or any other punishment rather than obey the court injunction or withdraw the union's termination of the government contract. Railway labor representatives called on the government and miners to stop the standoff and to have the President appoint a committee to find a solution. This call has not been responded to by the government or miners.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 5th] UMW national local leaders have denounced the Federal Court's fine as an attempt to destroy the coal miners' union. According to a presidential aide, President Truman's broadcast is under discussion, but no decision has been made yet.</p>
<p>Lewis Enters Court for Trial (Special Photograph from New York Times)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Molotov Adopts Compromising Attitude, Disarmament Proposal Passes in Principle, Handed Over to Twenty-Nation Committee to Draft Proposal <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, New York Correspondent, 5th Dispatch] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov recently stated in the UN Political Committee that the Soviet Union will not insist on veto power over the implementation of international disarmament, but the major powers should simultaneously reduce armaments in accordance with the Security Council's resolution. Molotov opposed signing an international treaty because it would be delayed and could not be implemented as soon as possible. Representatives of the United States and Britain unanimously welcomed this move by the Soviet Union. Observers speculate that the Soviet representative has received new instructions from Moscow after delaying this issue for two days, proving that the Soviet Union has changed its policy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 4th] Discussions on the issue of world disarmament made some progress today. After listening to the arguments of British and American representatives against the use of veto power in disarmament matters, the UN Political Committee appointed a subcommittee to draft a joint disarmament draft. The subcommittee consists of twenty countries: China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Canada, India, Czechoslovakia, Panama, Norway, Mexico, Egypt, Brazil, Australia, Colombia, Belgium, Syria, Ukraine, and Argentina. Before passing this decision, Soviet representative Molotov made a new proposal, and American representative Connolly immediately welcomed this action by the Soviet Union. However, at the same time, he stated that the United States does not intend to accept Molotov's amendment at this time, but is willing to give it the most serious consideration. The United States still insists that the jurisdiction and credibility of the Atomic Energy Commission cannot be impaired and will continue to carry out its original tasks. British representative Shawcross stated that any disarmament proposal should be based on the following four principles: (1) Before the Atomic Energy Commission prepares its plan, the parts of the disarmament resolution concerning atomic energy should still be handled by the Atomic Energy Commission, and the UN General Assembly should not interfere with its work. (2) Disarmament should not be limited to only part of it. For example, although the manufacture of atomic bombs has been prohibited, other weapons with collective destructive power, such as rockets, have not been prohibited, which is absolutely unacceptable. The Atomic Energy Commission should complete its current work and propose a plan to control atomic energy. After this plan is universally accepted, it should be implemented simultaneously with the control methods of other large-scale destructive weapons. We believe that the control of atomic energy should be limited to eliminating the possibility of its use for war. We should also encourage the peaceful use of atomic energy. (3) Any disarmament system must have an immediate and effective control and inspection system. Therefore, all military information should be disclosed at the same time as the establishment of the inspection agency. (4) The work of this control and inspection agency should not be subject to the control of veto power, whether for existing or future inventions of new weapons. We believe that there should also be an agency for controlling future inventions of new weapons, because we believe that after the abolition of atomic bombs, scientists will inevitably strive to develop even more terrifying weapons. Therefore, there should be an international agency that is not restricted by veto power to deal with this situation at any time. Molotov then stated that he did not object to the atoms listed by Shawcross and was prepared to accept the US proposal as the basis for discussion, and at the same time hoped to accept the Soviet Union's amendment.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, New York Correspondent, 5th Dispatch] The four powers' treaties with satellite countries are now stalled again. Molotov is waiting for new instructions from the Soviet government, while Bevin is preparing to return to England by ship on the 14th. The current difficulties delaying the signing of the treaty are two: (1) After everyone believed that the reparations issue had come to an end, Molotov raised new demands. Molotov argued that Italy should pay Albania $10 million in compensation, but the Paris Conference had already rejected this approach. Bevin and Byrnes still insist on their original positions. (2) Problems also arose with the amount of compensation for the losses of Allied assets in satellite countries. Italy and the Soviet Union agreed that the compensation amount accounted for 25% of the losses, while Britain and France insisted on 75%. After negotiations, Bevin agreed to reduce the British demand to 66%. (3) Byrnes expressed acceptance, but Molotov only allowed 40%, and France has not made concessions in this regard.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 4th] The UN Political and Security Committee met today to discuss the Spanish issue. First, Gu Weijun, head of the Chinese delegation, stated that the Chinese delegation fully supported the US proposal that Franco should hand over the Spanish government. Franco was the first to recognize the Chinese puppet government. As for the proposals put forward by Poland and Belarus, I dare not agree with them. The United Nations does not need to sever diplomatic and economic relations with Spain at this time, because the Franco regime does not pose an imminent danger to world peace. As for the proposal put forward by the United States, it is consistent with the doctrine of non-interference and can also respect the sovereignty of the Spanish people, so it is the most desirable.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 4th] The UN Political and Security Committee today appointed a subcommittee to review the various proposals on the Spanish issue. The committee represents fourteen countries: China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Belgium, Belarus, Chile, Cuba, the Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Poland, and Yugoslavia. Most of them have proposed severing ties with Franco's Spain or have expressed sympathy for this move.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Minister of State McNeil said in the Lower House today in response to a question from a Member of Parliament that the British Parliamentary Goodwill Mission to China will first seek the opinion of the Chinese government before deciding to travel to China in order to know whether it agrees with this move. Labor MP Williams believes that this proposal will be welcomed by the Chinese government, and he suggests that it can be launched in the summer of next year. When McNeil mentioned trade issues with China, he said that the British government's proposal on establishing trade with China was submitted to the Chinese government at the beginning of this month. The British government hopes to start these negotiations in the near future. Labor MP Barton also asked: Although British consuls in China have made unremitting efforts, British influence in China has disappeared. Is the government paying attention to this? Britain needs to continue to maintain friendly relations with the Chinese people. Has the authorities taken formal steps to promote this relationship? McNeil replied that he was willing to consider any specific steps. Former Foreign Secretary Eden then said: I think the government will be willing to obtain the closest and most complete trade relations with China based on the opinions put forward by MP Barton. McNeil replied yes, which is why the British government has made a commercial proposal.</p>

Members of the People's Republican Party held a meeting after the National Assembly adjourned today, but no decision was made on the candidate for prime minister. It is now scheduled to meet again tomorrow. It is widely rumored in the National Assembly that the Socialist Party intends to nominate a prime ministerial candidate from its own party, while the Communist Party intends to re-nominate Thorez as a prime ministerial candidate to counter the People's Republican Party.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 5th] MacArthur Headquarters issued a notice today, reprimanding the Japanese government for failing to comply with the ban and privately making direct contact with representatives of foreign governments stationed in Japan. Foreign representatives seek to obtain information, inspect equipment, or discuss other issues. As this has not been authorized by the US authorities, nor has it been notified to the US authorities, the Japanese government is to blame. Informed sources pointed out that this order applies to foreign representatives stationed at MacArthur Headquarters, because these representatives have recently not been allowed by the US authorities to contact Japanese government agencies in order to explore the possibility of restoring commercial relations in the future. MacArthur's announcement implies that the US authorities intend to strictly control all trade negotiations between Japan and foreign countries, with the exception of Japan-US negotiations.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The two hundred plus so-called "unruly officers and soldiers" sent to Shanghai from Burma by the British side a few days ago, after days of interrogation by the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command, it has been found that only a few of them are genuinely of military status. The rest are all innocent civilians, mostly from Guangdong, followed by Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. There are also quite a few from Shandong and Hebei. Some of them were workers who built the Burma Road. After the road was completed, they stayed in the border area between Shanghai and Burma, changing their profession to transporters, etc. Some are local residents of the border area, frequently traveling back and forth between the Shanghai-Burma border for small-scale commercial activities. There are also some who are farmers near Myitkyina. The reasons for their arrest are no more than the following: (1) During the Anti-Japanese War in the Burma border area, there were American troops stationed there. After the victory, the American troops left, but left behind a lot of military uniforms, which were worn by many local civilians, and thus they were identified as soldiers by the British. (2) Occasionally, they quarreled and fought with others over trivial matters, and were arrested and sent away on this pretext. (3) There are even more who, according to their confessions, were arrested inexplicably. They themselves did not know what crime they had committed. Many of them have families, wives, and children in Burma. This arrest and deportation has separated families and cut off livelihoods, making the situation very miserable. The Garrison Command has now reported the interrogation situation to the Ministry of National Defense for instructions and intends to contact the Executive Yuan to provide funds for them to return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>The reporter was surprised that since these two hundred plus people are mostly innocent civilians, why did the British side detain and deport them? Why did our diplomatic authorities have no objection to this? Deeply puzzled, yesterday I made a special visit to Chen Guolian, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to him, the office received only a few telegrams, vaguely referring to them as "unruly officers and soldiers," but there was no explanation of the individual "unruly" behavior of each person. It is not known whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing has received detailed case files from the British side. It is now planned to determine measures after the Garrison Command officially notifies the results of the interrogation.</p>

It is estimated that the surveying costs for both airports will be approximately 3.4 million yuan. This amount is not too large, but the problem lies in the compensation for land prices. Currently, the Air Force has not yet approved this budget, so the surveying work has not yet begun.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The vendor crisis has calmed down, but yesterday, the police in the jurisdictions of the Huangpu and Old Gate sub-bureaus still strictly cracked down, either driving away vendors or releasing them with a fine of 1,000 yuan. Therefore, people are once again feeling uneasy. Around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a large glass pane of a show window at No. 84 White Rock Road, Sincere Laundry Shop, which had just opened on the first day, was scratched with a metal object by an unknown person, causing it to fall and shatter. Some busybodies added fuel to the fire, spreading rumors that another incident had occurred with the vendors. Nearby shops closed their doors one after another, affecting the International Hotel area. At the same time, a fight broke out between vendors at Dongxin Bridge, which was also mistakenly reported as a vendor riot, causing passersby to flee and shops to close. Later, the police bureau dispatched a large number of personnel to investigate the truth, and the false alarm was dispelled. It was later heard that a similar situation occurred in the Taishan District.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Police Officer Appeals to the Council Regarding the Vendor Incident, Hoping That People From All Walks of Life Will Make a Fair Judgment <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xiaoqing and over one hundred twenty police officers from the Jing'an Temple sub-bureau in the city, in view of the fact that people from all walks of life do not understand the truth about the recent vendor incident and have been critical, have jointly appealed to the council. The original text is recorded below: "Respectfully addressed to the Speaker and Councilors: As an international metropolis, this city is the focus of attention both domestically and internationally. Since the victory, under your leadership, we have eliminated the old habits of the enemy and established a new democratic style. Municipal construction and national rejuvenation depend on this. This time, the problem of cracking down on vendors has caused a great wave, which is certainly due to the mischief of a few villains and bandits, but unruly vendors blindly following riots are also to blame. After reading various newspapers, you all value the poor vendors and criticize the police officers. You may not know that there are police officers who are even poorer than the vendors, and have already been forgotten by you all. The police are the enforcers of national laws and regulations. Although we cannot be the guardians of the people or the guides of society, we are duty-bound to protect the lives and property of the people and will make every effort to do so. If we ourselves have any dereliction of duty, we should be brought to justice. Otherwise, we do not want others to slander and insult us. Our monthly income is about 100,000 yuan, with an average of only three to four thousand yuan per day, far less than the price of a few fruits from the vendors. We still rely on this small amount to support our families, and our families are freezing and starving, which is commonplace. Once the uniform is removed, we are no better than prisoners and beggars. Every day, regardless of morning, dusk, day, night, rain, snow, wind, or frost, we endure hunger and cold, and work hard. What are we doing? We only hope to do our best to protect the people for the cause of national reconstruction and gain spiritual comfort. You all lead the entire city and not only have you not paid attention to it, but you have also severely blamed and criticized us. We have lost both material and spiritual things, so why should we continue in this position and be ridiculed? Even if we cannot abruptly stop working, we will jointly resign. This is a special letter to you, hoping that you will announce it to the world and make a fair judgment on all matters. We will be extremely grateful."</p>

At that time, the newly hired specialized committee member, salvage expert Oia, and maritime law expert Wei Wenhan will both attend and report. According to Li Gufan, director of the Shipping Administration Bureau, the mission of the committee is to actively promote the early establishment of a salvage company. The tools used by the salvage company will be requested from UNRRA. In the past, due to the lack of good tools, proper exploration could not be carried out. After the company is established, it plans to conduct exploration first and report the results to the shipowners to ask if they are willing to salvage. All costs required for salvage will be borne by the shipowners. One-third of the salvaged ships will go to the salvage company, and two-thirds will go to the shipowners. If they are enemy or puppet ships, the salvage costs will be paid by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. One-third of the salvaged ships will be awarded to the salvage company, and two-thirds will go to the Handling Bureau. After the ships are salvaged, they will be repaired immediately. If the salvaged ships exceed the salvage costs, the salvage company will be responsible for it. Salvage work will begin in the waters off Taiwan and Xiamen. Salvage of ships inside and outside the port of Shanghai will have to wait until April next year. The salvage of ships in the waters north of the port of Shanghai will be delayed even further.</p>
<p>To apply for a loan to salvage and repair ships, the following conditions must be met: (1) The gross tonnage of the ship is over twenty tons. (2) The ship's age is less than twenty years.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the signing of the Sino-US Aviation Agreement, Longhua Airport will be renovated so that giant aircraft can land and become a modern international aviation base. This project will take approximately four to five months and cost 85 billion yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the Ministry of Communications has established a special agency to rebuild Longhua Airport and has appointed technical personnel in charge on November 15. In fact, the project is already underway. The runway will also be rebuilt to be able to bear the weight of aircraft weighing over 150,000 pounds. According to the requirement that C-54 giant transport aircraft require a runway that can carry 85,000 pounds, the monthly target of this reconstruction is to make super-sized aircraft usable.</p>
<p>In addition to this main runway, auxiliary runways and parking lines will also be built. Hangars will not be built for the time being due to the excessive cost, but it may be possible to build some of them for specific purposes in the future. The entire project was originally scheduled to be completed within three months, but due to insufficient equipment, especially the lack of transportation equipment, it will not be completed until April or May of next year.</p>
<p>Before the completion of the Longhua Airport project, American airlines may cooperate with Jiangwan Airport and temporarily borrow the airport for use in accordance with the provisions of the air transport agreement. Jiangwan Airport was originally built by the Japanese army and later improved by the US Air Force. It is now exclusively used by aircraft belonging to UNRRA and the US Air Transport Group. In the future, it is planned to be exclusively used for the needs of Chinese military aircraft.</p>
<p>According to the air transport agreement, American aircraft will also be able to land, pass through, and operate in Tianjin and Hong Kong in the future, but due to economic limitations, the airports in the two cities have not yet been renovated. However, after the renovation in the future, Tianjin will be more important than Hong Kong. Guangzhou currently has Baiyun and Tianhe Airports for use. Negotiations with other countries on similar Sino-US air transport agreements have not yet begun.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, during the third day of the 12th National Christian Conference, representatives paid great attention to Chairman Chiang's call for spiritual construction. The conference will mobilize millions of believers nationwide to work toward spiritual revival. The plan is somewhat similar to the "Advancement Movement" advocated by the conference in the early days of the war of resistance. It is now planned to be divided into three annual phases, proceeding step by step. Churches across the country will be urged to actively participate in order to complete the project on schedule.</p>
<p>The conference also received a telegram from Dr. John R. Mott, General Secretary of the International Missionary Council, from New York, congratulating the conference on its success and expressing willingness to support China's Christian endeavors with international strength, while also endorsing the spiritual revival plan. Ms. Puddicombe and two other members of the British delegation also arrived yesterday from Burma and were warmly welcomed by the representatives.</p>

<p>Dr. Zhao Zichen delivered a speech at yesterday's conference, explaining that in today's turbulent world, only Christianity can save this crisis. Because human wisdom is exhausted, mankind needs a great power, and the source of this power will come from faith in Jesus Christ. He concluded by saying that we do not know how God controls the world, but truth will ultimately endure and cannot be destroyed. Today's conference will continue to discuss church affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e103">National Defense Medical Center: The Best-Equipped in the Country, Hospital with 900 Beds, Medical School Can Accommodate 4,000 Students <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to improve military medical services and cooperate with the construction of a new national defense army, the Military Medical Department recently convened a business meeting in Shanghai with the presidents of the general hospitals of the Joint Logistics Headquarters from all over the country. They plan to use the hospital and other buildings built by the forward enemy in the city center to form a National Defense Medical Center, engaging in training new military medical technicians to meet the needs of various health units of national defense. Yesterday afternoon, the department also hosted the city's press corps for a visit.</p>
<p>The National Defense Medical Center covers an area of more than 200 acres, including the Military Medical School, General Hospital, General Health Materials Depot, Health Camp, Health Experiment Institute, Library, and Museum. Among them, the Military Medical School is divided into departments of medicine, dentistry, nursing, health service, medical technology, and basic health training, accommodating over four thousand eight hundred people. The scale and equipment of the General Hospital are the best of any hospital in the country. There are more than 900 beds, and various equipment is received from the former Japanese Army Hospital, such as fluorescent lights, infrared rays, electrical massagers, shortwave viewers, X-rays, special surgical equipment, and dental equipment, all of which are fully equipped. Even cooking and laundry have steam and gas equipment, showing the scale of the facility. There are currently more than 200 wounded and sick officers and soldiers in the hospital, with lung disease patients being the most numerous. The Health Experiment Institute has a saline injection manufacturing facility, which produces large quantities for nationwide supply every day. The institute also keeps dozens of white rabbits to test whether the manufactured saline has any reaction. The Health Materials Depot currently has dozens of new-style ambulances donated by the United States, each with 14 stretcher beds, and another type with four stretcher beds, which can also seat 16 lightly wounded people. One vehicle is equivalent to several ordinary ambulances.</p>
<p>The Military Medical Department believes that the biggest shortcoming in China's military medical services is the lack of talent, so it will actively promote this medical center, transferring military medical personnel from various troops and agencies to receive training here, and recruiting students to specialize in various subjects. In addition, medical personnel with excellent performance are selected and sent to the United States Military Medical Center for practical research in separate groups. In August of this year, 121 people were specially transported to the United States. As for the resettlement plan for veterans, in addition to setting up hospitals for those who are severely disabled and unable to make a living to provide lifelong care, the rest will be assisted in education, employment, or sent back to their hometowns. These tasks still rely on the joint assistance of social organizations to seek solutions.</p>
<h3 id="e104">"Jade in a Prosperous Year, Grain in a Famine Year": The Sorrow of Antique Dealers, Groaning Secretly in a Quaint Environment, Longing for the Early Arrival of a Peaceful and Prosperous Era <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] "Jade in a prosperous year, grain in a famine year." In today's world of constant wars, high prices, and economic decline, it is no wonder that ordinary antique dealers are crying out in distress!</p>
<p>The word "antique" in English is called "Curious," which is interpreted as a treasure, or "Antiquities," meaning ancient relics. However, in addition to the two conditions of "ancient" and "precious," some say that it must also be valuable for historical and artistic research to be called an antique. The scope is also very broad, including porcelain, gold and stone, jewelry, calligraphy and painting, rubbings from stone inscriptions, miscellaneous objects, and so on.</p>
<p>According to people in the industry, in the Qing Dynasty, due to the wealth of the people and the abundance of goods, ordinary princes and ministers liked to collect antiques. With this trend, they all offered high prices to compete for them. Therefore, the antique industry at that time was truly a golden age. Later, because fewer and fewer Chinese people liked antiques, and they were also limited by economic conditions and unable to collect them, after the Republic of China, they relied entirely on foreign businessmen to maintain the industry. Later, because the trend of digging and robbing tombs prevailed everywhere, the government issued an order prohibiting the export of antiques. During this period, fake goods and forgeries also emerged in an endless stream.</p>
<p>To imitate a bronze ware in the style of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, using salt and other substances to scrub it and then bury it in the soil, after a few months or even years, it can also have ancient rust spots, and it will be mixed with the relics of the three dynasties. There are many things that are difficult to tell whether they are genuine or fake, and even we antique dealers may not be sure whether they are genuine or fake.</p>
<p>Beijing and Nanjing, which were once capitals, are mostly the centers of the antique industry. There are also many antique shops in this city, and there is also a large-scale antique market on Guangdong Road. However, due to the economic downturn, it is difficult to have a transaction. A few days ago, the China Antiquities Research Society held an exhibition. Among the exhibits, a Jiajing high-footed cup was priced at 1.5 million, a Ming Dynasty Wucai Langxi-style double phoenix large bowl was priced at 6 million, a chicken-blood stone seal was priced at 4.5 million, and a set of carved lacquer large screen was priced at 30 million. Many people went to visit, but they all just "looked" at them. Just think, in this year when food and clothing come first, who has so much spare money to buy back this kind of thing that cannot be eaten when hungry or worn when cold. After all, there are only a few wealthy literati and those nouveau riche who imitate the elegance.</p>
<p>A Pile of Scrap Copper and Rotten Iron, But Rare Treasures</p>
<p>To those who are obsessed with collecting antiques, what "outsiders" see as just an old painting, a fossil, or a pile of scrap copper and rotten iron, may be regarded by them as rare treasures worth a fortune, and they will spare no effort to occupy it for themselves. It is because of this desire to possess that many historical examples have resulted in the loss of property and damage to morality. For example, the He Shi Bi of King Zhao Huiwen of the Warring States period, King Zhao of Qin used a vast city to exchange for it. Emperor Taizong of Song sent a debater to fraudulently obtain Wang Xizhi's calligraphy treasured by a monk, and even wanted to take it into the coffin after his death. Zheng Chu of the Qing Dynasty said in his "On Antiques": "Bones and flesh cause lawsuits, and friends breed suspicion. When they are rich and noble, they are worth thousands of wonders, but when they are poor and lowly, they are not enough to exchange for cakes." These words have exhausted the disadvantages of antiques.</p>
<p>An enlightened antique dealer said to me well: "We should be based on the perspectives of archaeology, history, and art for antiques, to explore and discuss, with the premise of connecting ancient and modern culture and art. Otherwise, indulging in things will lose one's ambition, and it is not just a waste of money. Today, excavation work is certainly important, but we should try to preserve the cultural relics that have been unearthed."</p>
<p>In the Five Months After Victory, American Soldiers Inquired About It Slightly</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the International Trade Bureau, in the two years of the Republic of China, 21 and 22 alone, the export of antiques has been worth a total of 2,302,997 yuan in national currency. Think about how much material there is for studying ancient Chinese history and archaeology, and you will know that this is a major loss to Chinese culture. Now, when Chinese people study their own history, they sometimes have to travel across the ocean to libraries in London or Paris to borrow and copy materials, which is truly an endless feeling!</p>
<p>"Three years without opening, opening to eat for three years," was originally a portrayal of the high profits of antique dealers. However, today, let's take the shopkeepers in the antique market as an example. Because there has been no business, they have accumulated nearly one million yuan in rent arrears to the market. An old man who has been in this business for decades said to me with great emotion: "The antique industry will be good only after all industries are good. If all industries are not good, the antique industry will bear the brunt and be the first to be bad. After the victory in August last year, because the US Navy came to Shanghai, there was a period of five months when there was a little business. But they only bought some scattered items to take back to the country as souvenirs. Some even ran into the toilet because they had no money in their pockets, took off their underwear to exchange for money, and bought some things worth ten or eight US dollars. But when they were transferred to Qingdao and other places, this kind of business also decreased.</p>
<p>Business Is Very Different From the Past, and Antique Dealers Are Changing Careers</p>
<p>After the victory, antiques have not been formally exported, and foreign businessmen have not yet come to purchase them. The reason is of course that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot cooperate, and prices are rising. To tell you shamelessly today, many antique dealers have changed careers to sell newspapers, shine shoes, perform magic tricks, and set up stalls to be peddlers. ... He shook his head and smiled bitterly, looking forward and saying: "The antique industry will only improve when the country is peaceful and the weather is good!"</p>
<p>This is the sorrow of today's antique dealers! They live in an environment of pearls, jade, calligraphy, paintings, and inscriptions, which is quaint, but these things cannot be eaten when hungry or worn when cold. Now, they only have to endure hardships and put their full hope on the early arrival of a peaceful and prosperous era!</p>
<p>When will this world of war and chaos be peaceful and prosperous? And it is not just antique dealers who are looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Da Cheng Shipping Company Transports Refugees Back to Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>Huangpu Road Da Cheng Shipping Company was originally formed by merchants and celebrities from Shanghai and Northern Jiangsu, and has been engaged in passenger and cargo transportation in this city and other places. Recently, Northern Jiangsu has been recovered, and there is an urgent need to rescue refugees and transport supplies. The company has specially dispatched two small steamers to Zhen to provide services. Bao Dingbang, the manager of the company's shipping department, is stationed in Zhen to oversee all passenger and cargo transportation matters. It is now cooperating with the Su-Ning Relief Branch to transport refugees from Northern Jiangsu back to their hometowns and transport relief supplies, heading north along the Grand Canal to Huaiyin, Huaian, Gaoyou, Shiying and other places. Recently, the manager returned from Huaiyin to Zhen, reporting to Shanghai in detail the disaster situation and transportation conditions in various parts of Northern Jiangsu. (The picture shows the company's small steamer towing 20 civilian ships)</p>

<h3 id="e105">Involving Six Countries, Complex Real Estate Disputes, Resold as Enemy Property, Former Owners Trying to Recover, Executive Yuan Rejected the Original Lawsuit <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] During the period of the enemy puppet regime in this city, there were many disputes between Chinese and foreign people over the sale and purchase of real estate, resulting in a large number of real estate dispute cases after the victory. An American company, American &amp; Foreign Distributors Corp., had mortgaged vacant land and 14 factory buildings located at 1363 Yangshupu Road to Banque de l'Indochine. It had previously repaid 70% of the mortgage. After the Pacific War, the remaining amount was not repaid, and the guarantor, Wang Detang of Spanish nationality, repaid the full amount. Due to this relationship, on March 21, 1942, Banque de l'Indochine entrusted British business Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. to transfer the title to Wang Detang's name. Wang Detang sold the property to the Japanese company Shanghai Warehouse Trust Co., Ltd. at a price, and had already transferred the ownership to Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. After the victory, the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau took over the property and nationalized it. The company actually entrusted lawyer Luo Jie to submit a presentation to the Enemy Property Administration Bureau applying for its return and appealing to the Executive Yuan. The process of the case is very complicated, involving six countries including China, the United States, Britain, France, Spain and Japan. Now the Executive Yuan rejected the original lawsuit based on the first paragraph of Article 8 of the Law of Appeal.</p>
<p>The reasons given by the Executive Yuan are as follows: "First, the property was originally owned by Japanese nationals, or was purchased with funds from Japanese puppets. The property rights are all owned by the central government. The third paragraph of Article 4 of the Measures for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property in the Recovered Areas has clear provisions. The real estate in this case was formally purchased by the Japanese company Shanghai Warehouse Trust Co., Ltd. from Wang Detang, which is an indisputable fact. Therefore, the original disposition agency's disposition of nationalizing the property in accordance with the aforementioned measures is not inappropriate. As for the appellant's claim that the real estate was sold privately by a person without ownership (Wang Detang) and without the consent of the person who has the right to dispose of it (the appellant), it should be invalid according to law. Regardless of whether it is true or not, it is a matter of private rights dispute. If the appellant suffers any damage as a result, he should file a lawsuit with the competent judicial authority for verification. He must not request the revocation of the administrative disposition based on the existence of ownership, because the disposition made by the administrative chief agency in accordance with administrative laws and regulations is not absolutely bound by judicial precedents."</p>
<h3 id="e106">To Protect People's Health, the City Council Suggests to the National Assembly to Add Articles to the Constitution <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The fourth meeting of the Health Committee and the fifth meeting of the Regulations Committee of the City Council passed the "Proposal to the National Assembly to Add Articles to the Constitution to Protect People's Health"! It was also decided by the joint meeting of the conveners of various committees that the council would send a telegram to the presidium of the National Assembly to adopt and implement it. The council has sent the proposal to the chairman of the National Assembly yesterday. The original telegram reads as follows:</p>
<p>To the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Republic of China in Nanjing: We respectfully state that the strength or weakness of the people's health is related to the rise and fall of the nation, and the cultivation of the people's physique, the pursuit of hygiene, and the ability of the government to advocate social assistance, so that the people, regardless of rich or poor, can enjoy equal opportunities for nutrition, hygiene, medical treatment, and prolonging life. For the past hundred years, our country has been plagued by internal strife and foreign aggression, politics has not been on the right track, and the system has many loopholes. Measures to improve the health of the people have not been significantly developed, resulting in the people's physique becoming increasingly weak, their spirits depressed, and their ambitions depressed. This has led the countries of the world to regard our people as the "sick man of East Asia," which is extremely shameful. Although there have been many people with insight who have advocated in many ways, the people do not value hygiene, and social customs are simple. If this continues, it will have a profound and significant impact on the survival of the nation and the rejuvenation of the country. However, the crux of the problem is that although it is due to the people's own mistakes, the state has failed to formulate a comprehensive and concrete policy, which is also difficult to shirk responsibility. According to the major cities in Europe and the United States, they all regard people's health care as an important social issue, and all have organizations such as medical services for the people, health care for the people, or disease insurance. The central government does not hesitate to do its best to coordinate the overall situation and make it a national policy to protect the health of the people. As for France's formulation of the Fourth Republic Constitution, Article 22 of the Declaration of Human Rights clearly stipulates that "the state guarantees that all citizens can enjoy national health and the protection of pregnant women, the development of sports, public health, and various measures from science," which is sufficient to be a model for modern democratic countries to seek welfare for the people. Now that our government is convening the National Assembly to formulate the Constitution, all the rights that the people should enjoy must be within the consideration of all of you. The council has passed the "Proposal to the National Assembly to Add Articles to the Constitution to Protect People's Health" at the fourth meeting of the Health Committee and the fifth meeting of the Regulations Committee. It was also "resolved by the joint meeting of the conveners of various committees: This council will elaborate on the reasons and send a telegram to the presidium of the National Assembly to adopt and implement it." The record is on file, so we specially state the ins and outs and send a telegram to your group to issue a photo, give it adoption, hand it over for discussion and implementation, so as to extend human rights and strengthen the nation. We are extremely apprehensive and await orders. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai City Council, Xu Jiqing, Deputy Speaker (Hai Wei) bows.</p>

<p>The court investigated the Yu Yiming case in the afternoon. Yu was accused of serving as a consultant for the Taixian branch of the Overseas Chinese Zhonghua Tobacco Distribution Association, and the preparatory director of the Puppet Taixian Rice and Grain Joint Society. Two witnesses, Wang Dasan and Zhao Jiyan, were summoned, and their statements were all favorable to the defendant. In addition, two people who were in custody, Ding Guanping and Shen Weirao, were brought as witnesses. Ding was the director of the Puppet Shanghai Masnan Road District Court Detention Center, and the director of the Puppet Northern Jiangsu Food Management Committee. He testified that the Puppet Taixian Rice and Grain Joint Society was never established at all. Shen Weiting was the chairman of the Puppet Zhonghua Tobacco Distribution Association, and testified that the Puppet Zhonghua Tobacco Distribution Association was divided into two parts, Chinese and Japanese, and the foreign ports were all managed by the Japanese, so Yu Yiming's affairs cannot be discussed. The court ordered that the case be adjourned for further hearing, and Yu Ding and Shen were detained.</p>

<p>The German Nazi war criminal Ochtor and his 20 accomplices are still on trial in the US military court. Yesterday, Shen Ke, who had been acquitted, testified in court for the defendants. According to Shen Ke, not long ago, he had sued Randall, the director of the Far East Branch of the United Press International. After a month of trial, the US military court declared Shen Ke and five others innocent, but they were still detained in the Tilanqiao Prison and not released. Shen Ke had been a reporter for the German news agency for many years and had been in contact with Ochtor and others, but claimed that he was not a member of Ochtor's spy network, and claimed that after Germany surrendered, the spy organization was preparing to disband. After Germany surrendered, it notified the organization to find a way to contact the German side. The German spy agency and the German Consulate were located at No. 2 Beijing Road in the same year (now the US Navy Headquarters), and the scope was later expanded. Shen Ke admitted that he was a German reporter at that time and had a very high salary, receiving a salary of more than 1,000 marks per month. The house where he lived was on Haig Road, and later became the official residence of General Stone, the commander of the US 14th Air Force. The judge then asked what kind of house he lived in, and he claimed: "Very good! Very good!"

Shen Ke was questioned by lawyers from both sides for two hours. The court will today be... The prosecutor told reporters that the group of German war criminals, whether they are convicted or acquitted in the future, must all be repatriated to Germany for punishment in their home country.</p>

<p>(Persistent Dysentery for Seven Years)</p>
<p>Zhou Zhicheng asks: My relative has suffered from dysentery for seven years, recently with bloody stools, abdominal and navel pain, and although the appetite is still good, food is passed unchanged after eating, leading to exhaustion. I would like to ask: (1) A stool test reveals the presence of amoeba. What disease is this? If it is bacillary dysentery or intestinal tuberculosis, how should it be treated? (2) How should chronic constipation be treated?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Gu Yuqi, Medical Doctor] (1) Your relative's dysentery needs a detailed stool test to determine if it is amoebic dysentery, bacillary dysentery, intestinal tuberculosis, or colitis. According to your letter, the fact that food is passed unchanged after eating suggests another cause. Perhaps there is a decrease in gastric and intestinal secretions, leading to indigestion. A confirmed diagnosis is the priority. If it is chronic amoebic dysentery, Enterovioform and Emetin injections can be effective. If it is intestinal tuberculosis, treatment is difficult and rarely effective. (2) For chronic constipation, Nujol can be used, taken one or two tablespoons morning and evening, until the bowel movements are smooth, then discontinue.</p>
<p>(2) Lymph Node Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Chen Qian-guang asks: I have a weak constitution. Twenty years ago, two nodules appeared on both sides of my neck, without pain or itching, but a slight discomfort when turning my head, and a slight fever. Recently, they have been gradually enlarging. The doctor said it is tuberculous lymphadenitis. I have had six or seven injections of glucose calcium and vitamin B, but they have not subsided, and small nodules have appeared below them. I would like to ask: (1) Is this lymph node tuberculosis? (2) Will injections of glucose calcium and vitamin B be effective? (3) Are there more effective treatments? Please recommend a specialist doctor. (4) After glucose and vitamin injections, red patches appear on my ankles and calves, slightly sore to the touch. What is the reason? Is it related to the injections?</p>
<p>[Answer from Dr. Gu Yuqi, Medical Doctor] (1) The nodules on the side of the neck are lymphadenitis, possibly due to pulmonary tuberculosis. An X-ray examination or photograph can be used for diagnosis, or it may be due to other reasons. It is best to have a blood test to determine the cause. (2) Injections of glucose calcium and vitamin B are beneficial for pulmonary tuberculosis, but if it is due to another pathogen, they will not be effective. (3) After a confirmed diagnosis, appropriate medication can be used. (4) For tuberculous lymphadenitis, in addition to the above-mentioned injections, oral cod liver oil capsules, and nutritious diet, you can also consult a specialist to study whether X-ray irradiation is possible.</p>

It is reported that after receiving the order, the garrison headquarters will notify the 23rd Regiment of the military police within days that military personnel will not be prohibited from entering dance halls. It is expected that the city's major dance halls will soon be frequented by military personnel, which will undoubtedly affect the business of several establishments that cater exclusively to military personnel.</p>

<p>The supply of coal briquettes in the city is manufactured by the machine-made coal briquette industry and the hand-cranked coal briquette industry. Their raw materials depend on the allocation of the Shanghai District Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The allocation to the hand-cranked coal briquette industry has been suspended since November, and the machine-made coal briquette industry also only received 10,000 tons of allocated coal in November. However, the previous city-wide monthly demand was more than 40,000 tons, which was only enough to meet one-quarter of the actual sales. Factories such as Yitai Xing Nanyang have successively suspended production this month due to lack of raw materials, causing great panic among the people for household cooking fuel. The black market price has reached the high price of 400,000 yuan per ton. The door-to-door price of coal briquettes is 16,000 yuan to 18,000 yuan per dan.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Reasons for High Gold Prices - Loose Money Supply, High Prices in Other Cities - Central Bank's Selling Is Relatively Passive <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The market price of gold continued to reach new highs. The reporter interviewed a certain expert yesterday to ask about the reasons. It is said that the rise in gold prices has three internal factors: (1) Recently, the money supply in Shanghai has been loose. Because the silver and money industry is approaching the end of the year, the remaining funds are no longer released, and most of the recovered funds are used to purchase gold, resulting in an increase in real demand and soaring prices. (2) Gold prices are high in other cities, such as Tianjin, which is already more than 3 million higher, causing the gold price in this city to rise accordingly. (3) The central bank's recent sale of gold bars is not as active as in the past, which is also related to the rise in gold prices without falling.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Transportation Management Committee held a full executive committee meeting at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon, starting at 4:00 PM. The attendees included Chairman Zu Yi, Executive Committee members Zhang Fuyun, Li Gan, Chen Changtong, Lin Weiying, etc. The meeting adjourned at around 8:00 PM. It is reported that the main topic of discussion was the opening up of foreign cotton imports.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Inverted Prices Between This and Other Cities - Both Yarn and Cloth Markets Are Weak <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was still lifeless. Because the reserve price was already high, the purchasing power of the countryside was weak, and the guest merchants handled spot transactions sluggishly. Furthermore, major factories in Shanghai shipped in large quantities to Tianjin, Wuhan, and other places to sell at reduced prices. Because the reduced sales prices in other cities were still higher than the official prices in Shanghai, yarn prices in other cities were lowered. Trading within the market was limited to price limits as usual. The asking price outside the market was slightly lower by 20,000 to 30,000. For example, 42-count Blue Phoenix was 5 million, 32-count Blue Phoenix was 3.15 million, Silver Moon was 3.11 million, 20-count Double Horse was 2.35 million, Golden City was 2.33 million yuan, Red Kui was 2.34 million, Cai Kui was 2.3 million, Golden Pagoda was 2.29 million, and Golden Star was 2.28 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Tianjin and Wuhan merchants' appetite for cotton cloth was still heard to be dispersed. It was heard that there was an inverted price phenomenon in other cities. The market in this city continued to decline. New buyers were active on the market, and there were frequent sell-offs. The old Four Gentlemen Serge fell to within 110,000 yuan. Various fine cloths also fell by a small amount of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. There was little change in colored cloths, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Cotton Stock Registration - Not Yet Fully Reported <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Textile Control Commission handled the registration of cotton flower numbers and foreign firm cotton stocks throughout the city. Yesterday was the deadline. It was heard that yarn factories have reported the numbers, but the Textile Control Commission said that it has not received them yet. The flower number side will not be able to report the numbers until next Monday. Seven foreign firms have already reported the numbers, but most of them are orders.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Handkerchief Industry Lacks Raw Materials <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The handkerchief industry in this city is facing serious difficulties due to raw material problems. According to industry insiders, the industry received an allocation of cotton yarn last month. Because the Textile Control Commission based its allocation on the China Textile Report, it discounted it by 60%, resulting in a total allocation of only 91 pieces for the four allocations. However, there are more than 80 factories in the industry, with 1,550 looms, and the current number of operating looms is 1,298. In terms of day work alone, the monthly demand for 40-count and 60-count single yarn is more than 386 pieces. If night work is added, the number must be doubled. However, the industry received an allocation of 91 pieces of cotton yarn last month, which is only enough to supply the industry for seven days of day work. The allocation this month is even far less than this. Black market cotton yarn cannot be obtained, which not only increases costs but also violates the law. There were still cotton stocks to make up for it last month, but the current cotton stocks are running out, and there is a possibility of work stoppage at any time.</p>

<p>The fourth-period delivery of Chinese stocks debuted yesterday. Bearish forces implemented suppression, but there were many struggles along the way. Low prices appeared in the afternoon. Bearish forces made up for it. At the close, the market was still firm. Spot stocks opened expensive in the morning, but with the debut of the delivery, bearish forces implemented suppression, pushing the delivery of Yong Yarn down to the same price as the spot price. The financial community sighed and could not profit. Nos. 199, 91, and 218 were sold and turned from stable to weak. No. 229 was also sold and started downstream. Nos. 176 and 198 were bought on dips. After 10:00 AM, long and short sides swapped positions, and the market hesitated. Nos. 185, 190, and 73, etc., covered shorts. Although No. 215 was sold, Nos. 185 and 99 were repeatedly bought. Before 11:00 AM, the market had risen to a high price. Soon after, Nos. 199, 12, 152, 89, and 99 were sold again. It was also rumored that the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory had losses of 2.6 billion yuan, and people were panicked. Near noon, it retreated to a low price. Compared with the previous close, Yong Yarn fell slightly, and Xinhuo, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by more than 50%. Meiya fell by a staggering 10% weak. Cold stock Xinya fell by 20%, Lian fell by 10%, underwear Yonggong Rong Factory rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly. The rise and fall of delivery before the noon closing price on the previous day varied. Panic was even worse in the afternoon. A selling frenzy broke out, and there were many declines. However, after the low price, the bearish forces profited and covered. Nos. 215 and 102, etc., were bought. In addition, the evening newspaper reported that the National Assembly had been postponed for ten days and that political disputes would resume negotiations, and people's hearts gradually settled. In the end, there was a slight pull-up. Compared with the previous close, Yong Yarn and Huajian fell by a small amount. Xinhuo and Xinguang fell by a little more than 50%. Meiya, Jingfu, and Qinxing each fell by about 10%. Cold stock Xinya fell by 20%, Lian fell by 10%, Shanhua Datong was flat, Rong Yuan rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly. The delivery of Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huachen fell slightly, and Meiya fell by a little less than 10%. The prices of various stocks outside the market fell slightly.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were still difficult to boost yesterday. As a result, British Federation, Deutsche, Yeguang remained flat. Yisha, Yibei, Shipping, Steel, and Paper fell slightly. Xiangtai Lumber was bought at 11,300 yuan.</p>

<p>In the coal market, after the Fuel Management Committee sent a letter to the association to investigate the coal stocks of its members, the general willingness to import slackened. Because the market price was too high, actual sales were not as smooth as before, and the market has slightly recovered by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the past. Anthracite is selling well in a timely manner, and the market is still standing out. Because bituminous coal prices have risen, the local coking cost of coke is insufficient, and the prices in the producing areas have also risen. All goods have generally risen by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>

<p>In the foreign merchant tea market, it was learned that the batch of black and green tea samples sent abroad by the British firm Tongfu Yangxing in this city a month ago have now been received one after another in the destination countries. Chen Te Qimen is the most popular, and they have been instructed to ship them in bulk. Yesterday, the company expanded its purchasing appetite in the market and purchased 800 boxes from Longtaichang Teashop, at a price of 180,000 yuan per dan. The market remained firm. As for high-grade Chen Qimen from 1945, which has been stored for a long time, buyers continued to demand it, but there were few transactions, and the situation was ultimately popular. As for green teas such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, most cargo owners were still very willing to sell, but it was extremely difficult to sell low-grade goods. Buyers were doing their best to suppress the prices of higher-quality teas, so the number of transactions decreased again, and the process was unremarkable. The domestic sales of black and green tea were becoming increasingly weak for both local and guest merchants, and it was difficult to reassure people.</p>

<p>The Farmers Bank of China is offering silkworm cocoon loans to alleviate the current difficulties of silk manufacturers, as autumn silk is currently being processed. According to the bank's estimate, the processing cost of autumn silk is at most 900,000 yuan per picul, so it is stipulated that the loan amount is 900,000 yuan per picul. However, the actual processing cost of silk manufacturers is at least 1.4 million yuan per picul or more, and they have requested an increase. Yesterday, representatives were sent to the Farmers Bank to negotiate. It is learned that the autumn silk is still purchased by the government, and the price is also determined by the government. The Farmers Bank is not in a position to increase the processing loan. It is reported that the silk industry representatives will visit Governor Bei of the Central Bank for instructions and decision.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Hong Kong Smuggling of Gold to South China - Exceeds 3,000 Taels Per Day - Mostly Carried Privately by Travelers Between Hong Kong and Guangdong <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Central Bank, Hong Kong can be said to be the hub for capital smuggling. Because the official price of Mexican gold is more than 50% different from the market price in Hong Kong, and the official price of Indian gold is also more than 30% different from Hong Kong, the source of Hong Kong's large-scale smuggling of gold is supplied by Mexico and India. Hong Kong and Guangzhou are only separated by a small area, and the large amount of smuggling into South China is a natural trend. It is estimated that more than 3,000 taels of gold are smuggled into South China every day. Although the Kowloon Customs has strengthened its anti-smuggling efforts, the total number of passengers traveling between Hong Kong and Guangdong every day is about 50,000 or more. It is indeed difficult to check them one by one. Regarding the issue of capital fleeing to Hong Kong, it is said that this is caused by the unstable domestic situation and the continuous depreciation of legal tender. At the same time, people with capital generally regard Hong Kong as a paradise, so eradicating capital fleeing to Hong Kong has a very close relationship with the recovery of Hong Kong. In addition to taking passive preventive measures from the aspect of restricting exchange, the government is currently drafting plans by relevant parties to enable floating capital to flow into the production sector domestically and prevent it from fleeing again.</p>

<h3 id="e157">108th Anniversary of Wu Xun's Birth Celebrated Yesterday; Confucius Hsiang-hsi and Others Gave Speeches of Praise <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday (the 4th) was the 108th anniversary of the birth of Wu Xun, the beggar-educator. The Shandong Fellow Association and Wu Xun School of this city specially held a memorial meeting at 2:30 pm yesterday at the Shandong Fellow Association headquarters on Ximen Road. Chairman Li Qiaozhao, after reporting on Wu Xun's life and deeds, Chairman Kong Xiangxi of the Wu Xun School delivered a speech, saying that Wu Xun, as a beggar, deeply felt the suffering of being uneducated, so he founded schools to help others. His spirit of extending his own feelings to others is praised by everyone, and its impact is enough to move the world, and he is indeed a good model for us.</p>
<p>Then, Ms. Wang Liming, wife of Liu Zhanen, expressed two thoughts: (1) All people in the world, whether they are flaunting their power, rich and powerful, or freezing and starving, without money and power, cannot escape one word - "death." (2) The true difference between people lies in the fact that some people still exist after death, while others are dead even though they are alive. The former includes Wu Xun, Sun Yat-sen, etc. The latter is common in today's society, and even in today's meeting place, there are those who have "no sense of right and wrong, no sense of good and evil, no sense of compassion." Corrupt officials should be spurned. Only Wu Xun's spirit of service will last forever.</p>
<p>Dr. Shao Shuangqiu, a professor at Great China University, said that the most admirable thing about Wu Xun's spirit is that after receiving praise from the emperor, he still worked hard, which is very different from modern people who start to corrupt after achieving success in their careers, which is worthy of our vigilance and emulation.</p>
<p>Finally, poet Zang Kejia spoke. Zang summarized "people" into three categories: (1) altruism, (2) egoism, (3) selfishness. Those who are "selfish" specialize in exploiting the common people and enriching themselves by eating the blood of others. Only the first type of people, such as Wu Xun who are "altruistic," are praised by people for generations. Yesterday's memorial meeting was quite enthusiastic, and finally, famous Peking Opera performers added to the fun, and it ended at dusk.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] At 2:00 pm yesterday, the Xiang Army team, volleyball champion of Fudan Chongqing campus, was challenged by the Xiang Army team, a strong volleyball team from Shanghai Law School, to compete at the Fudan court. The blue velvet clothes and trousers of the Law Xiang team contrasted interestingly with the scattered and disorganized clothing of the Fudan Xiang team. The Fudan Xiang team, which had won the championship of the Fudan University and Beijing University leagues in Chongqing, naturally worked harder for its first battle after arriving in Shanghai. In the first two games, both sides played calmly, without much brilliant performance, and the Fudan Xiang team took the lead, resulting in a score of 2-0. From the third game, the Law Xiang team started a desperate fight, cheering on the whole team. However, their offense was limited to not very fierce spikes on the left of the second row, and occasional connected pressure balls in the middle and left of the front row. The Fudan Xiang team responded easily, and the difficult situation was easily overcome. The Fudan Xiang team defeated the Law Xiang team 3-0. According to reports, the Fudan Xiang Army volleyball team has lacked practice recently, resulting in a lack of brilliant performances. If they can intensify their training, it will not be difficult for them to become a strong volleyball team in Shanghai, and Fudan can also revive its former glory.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Record of the Fallen Sheng Zufeng, a Southern Anhui Scholar's Descendant and Jinan Beauty <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— November 26th Airmail Report, Special Jinan Correspondent He Bingru</p>
<p>Recently, a legendary case has caused a sensation in all corners of Jinan City. The content of this matter can truly be described as romantic and poignant, providing a timely warning to young ladies regarding the choice of a lifelong companion!</p>
<p>Peerless Beauty, Cast-Off Wife</p>
<p>This story, from its beginning to the present, spans more than twenty years. It originated in Jinan and ended in Chongqing. The planting of causes and reaping of results, joys and sorrows, and partings and reunions are rich in the structure of a legendary novel, and at the same time, it is a reflection of modern society. The protagonist of this story is Miss Sheng Zufeng, a peerless beauty who was once famous in Jinan. During the revolutionary tide of 1928, she abandoned her lover who had shown her kindness as high as a mountain. More than ten years later, during the Anti-Japanese War, she was unfortunately abandoned by her husband, whom she had faithfully served, resulting in her wandering the streets of Chongqing and becoming a cast-off wife. Recently, a returnee from Chongqing revealed a past event in Jinan, arousing general feelings of regret and sorrow, and at the same time, recalling Miss Sheng's "innate beauty" as an embellishment to the scenery of the lakes and mountains! Miss Sheng, being a descendant of a scholar from southern Anhui and a beauty of Jinan, leaves an indelible impression in people's minds!</p>
<p>Past Events Like Smoke, Futile Recollections</p>
<p>Around 1925 or 1926, there was a top student named Sheng Zufeng at Jinan Girls' Middle School. She was from a prominent Anhui family, residing in Jinan. This Miss Sheng was indeed a peerless beauty. To use the words from old novels to describe her, she possessed the beauty to "sink fish and fell birds, put the moon to shame and the flowers to blush." Miss Sheng truly deserved such praise. As for Miss Sheng's figure, her fullness was "more slender than Flying Swallow, yet not too thin; more plump than Yang Guifei, yet not too fat." She possessed just the right balance. Furthermore, regarding her talent and learning, although she could not compare to Xie Daoyun, her writing was excellent. Among her peers, she truly stood out like a crane among chickens, an invaluable standard woman of the era. Her former residence was located west of the Shandong Provincial Assembly in Jinan, inside a large gate on the north side of the road. Next to the gate were inscribed the four large characters "Southern Anhui Sheng Residence." Now, after so many changes, one cannot help but feel the sense of "human face and peach blossoms." Her father, Sheng Yibaimin, was a learned scholar with a wealth of knowledge, and also a romantic celebrity who did not care about his appearance. This Miss Sheng inherited her father's legacy, and through the influence of her family, became a famous "modern" Miss of the time.</p>
<p>Sun Lang's Good Fortune, Scorn for the Literary Circle</p>
<p>In that era, there were naturally many people who admired Miss Sheng's talent and beauty and sought to marry her. They were truly as numerous as carps crossing the river, carried by the cart and measured by the bushel, too many to count. However, Miss Sheng did not accept any of them. Only one young man from her hometown, Sun Jianhong, gained Miss Sheng's favor and became her only lover. At that time, Sun Jianhong was also from a prominent Anhui family and served as the secretary of the Shandong Provincial Finance Department. With his youthful and handsome appearance, he not only matched Miss Sheng in age and looks but also excelled in both modern and classical literature. His works were constantly published in various publications and widely recited. At that time, between Daming Lake and Thousand-Buddha Mountain, this pair of lovers was often seen strolling amidst the beautiful scenery of the lake and mountains, their shadows following each other, adding a beautiful embellishment to the landscape. The people of Jinan all envied Sun Lang's immense good fortune, and Sun Lang also looked down on the literary circle for exclusively possessing such a beauty. At this time, Miss Sheng's family was in poor condition, and Sun Jianhong did his best to provide assistance. This was also a responsibility that Sun Jianhong should fulfill. But there was also another matter that drove their love even further, that was, Miss Sheng's father Sheng Baimin, through Sun Jianhong's introduction, went to Qingdao to work as a tax official, and somehow embezzled public funds. Sheng Baimin was detained in court. For the sake of love, for the sake of being a son-in-law, Sun Jianhong did not hesitate to ruin his family to alleviate the disaster. He sold all his property, went to Qingdao in person, and rescued his father-in-law from the court. In fact, Sun Jianhong was both Miss Sheng's lover and Miss Sheng's benefactor. Therefore, everyone predicted that this happy couple would surely be able to stay together forever.</p>
<p>Seeking a New Partner, Strangers Pass By</p>
<p>Who would have thought that good things are often fraught with setbacks, and fate makes fools of people. In 1928, the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army and the Jinan Massacre - the May 3rd Massacre, forced the postponement of this couple's wedding. Before long, the Shandong Provincial Government was established in Tai'an, and Sun followed the Finance Department to Tai'an. Sheng Zufeng also went to Tai'an to participate in the Shandong Provincial Party Affairs Training Class. Her father Sheng Baimin served as the editor of the Chenguang Daily. Logically speaking, their wedding was very likely to be held in Tai'an. Unexpectedly, after Sheng arrived in Tai'an, she was baptized by the tide of revolution and became a progressive member of the women's circle. Everyone praised her as the flower of the Party Affairs Training Class. The people who came and went with Miss Sheng every day were all dignitaries in the Party and government at that time. A great change took place in her mind, causing her to forget the thousands of favors that Sun Jianhong had shown her. She felt that she was a proud child of the revolution, a darling of the times. With Sun Jianhong as just a Finance Department clerk, his position was small and his head was young. How could he be Miss Sheng's lifelong companion? She wholeheartedly wanted to seek a new ideal partner, or marry a member of the Provincial Party Department, or a Ph.D. who had studied abroad, which would be in line with her logic. Thus, the previous love for Sun Jianhong gradually faded away. "Sun Lang is now a stranger," no longer able to be Miss Sheng's attendant.</p>
<p>Wielding the Sword of Wisdom, Severing the Threads of烦恼</p>
<p>Sheng Zufeng further forced Sun Jianhong, demanding that he dissolve their engagement, and told him: "Unless you can immediately become a county magistrate, or have assets of more than several tens of thousands of yuan, there is still room for discussion. Otherwise, give up your heart and don't even think about being Miss Sheng's husband." Sun Jianhong suffered this major blow, truly like a bolt from the blue, falling off a cliff. All day long he was crazy and didn't drink or eat. He repeatedly thought of suicide. Fortunately, his colleagues and friends persuaded him and no accident occurred. After a considerable period of time, Sun Jianhong made the determination that "a true man need not worry about having no wife." He cut off his hair, severed the threads of love, and got rid of all烦恼. He immediately changed his name to Sun Gengsheng, indicating that the past Sun Jianhong was dead, and the current Sun Gengsheng was a new man, determined to improve. Before long, he truly became a county magistrate, fighting for a breath of air for poor clerks, and married and had children, establishing a family. His family life was very happy, and he warmed and repaired the scars in his heart.</p>
<p>New People Laughing, Old People Crying</p>
<p>But seeing new people laughing, who hears old people crying? When Sun Jianhong was seeking death and extremely distressed, it was precisely the time when Sheng Zufeng was displaying her social skills and making a big splash. She was in the limelight and invincible. Although a certain member of the Provincial Party Department was once considered a friend by Miss Sheng, his proposal was never successful. Later, a Ph.D. who studied in the United States, Mr. Zhang Hongji, uniquely obtained the favor of the peacock screen and became Miss Sheng's husband. They were very affectionate. Later, they went to Qingdao together, and their feelings were still very good. The love tragedy that was once circulated in Shandong society gradually came to an end and was no longer mentioned by anyone.</p>
<p>Beauty Aging, Love Unreliable</p>
<p>On July 7, 1937, the sound of gunfire at Lugou Bridge ignited the flames of war everywhere. Chinese people were defending their motherland and resisting Japan. Before long, the war clouds spread to Shandong. Zhang Hongji also took his beloved wife and fled to the rear, Chongqing, working at the Beibei Compilation Museum. However, the couple's feelings suddenly deteriorated. Was it the waning of color and love? Or were there other reasons? Outsiders did not know the inside story. But before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Zhang Hongji suddenly abandoned Sheng Zufeng, saying that Sheng Zufeng had a mental illness. After divorcing, he left Beibei and went to Chengdu to become a professor at a certain university. At this point, Sheng Zufeng became a cast-off wife.</p>
<p>The Body of Catkins, Difficult to Chase Yanghua</p>
<p>After Sheng Zufeng was abandoned, she truly became half-crazy. At first, she still lived in Beibei, calling out for her husband everywhere, and saying that her husband was coming to pick her up soon. Someone asked if she was divorced? She was at a loss. Later, she was evicted from the Beibei hotel. She carried her only wicker basket and a quilt, left Beibei, and took a boat all the way to Chongqing. At Chaotianmen Wharf, she took a sedan chair, bumping around for a long time, but never found her husband. The sedan chair bearer also saw that her nerves were abnormal and pushed her off the sedan chair. She herself walked into a new hotel on Zhongzheng Road in Chaotianmen, broke into a room that already had a man living in it, saying it was her husband and she must live inside. People drove her out again. She turned to a high slope across the street, a place called "Chaotian Hua." Because of the fire lanes, there were some bricks piled up next to the doors of the houses on both sides, and there was also a tile on the roof. Regardless of the wind and rain, she was all cramped in this place, actually making it Miss Sheng's temporary boudoir. I don't know whether Miss Sheng, in the scenery of spring days, winter nights, summer openings, and autumn palace locusts, had ever recalled her past, and whether she felt that she had become沾泥The pants were not long enough to devote herself to the social occasions, and compete with a group of flying杨花Up and down!</p>
<p>Sun Lang Affectionate, Miss Thin Fate</p>
<p>Miss Sheng also wrote very beautiful characters on the walls and the ground in her place of residence, looking for her lost husband, thus causing a sensation in the nearby neighborhood. Seeing this highly educated woman fallen to this state, everyone felt pity and sympathy. Every day, several charitable women would bring her food to eat. Before long, a Shandong lady passed by this place and turned the matter over to the Shandong folks. There were many people who gave her money and clothes, and also reported to the leaders of the Shandong women's circle to find ways to help her. Soon, her teacher picked her up at a hotel in "Lianglukou," while the Shandong folks donated a part of the money to her, and wrote a letter to her husband in Chengdu, but the reply said, "They have already divorced and cannot intervene." At the same time, several wealthy friends she made in Tai'an were also in Chongqing, but all refused to admit that they knew her. Only one lover who was abandoned by her, Sun Jianhong, who changed his name to Sun Gengsheng, was deeply affectionate and did not remember the old grudges. Standing in a compassionate position, he sent her a lot of money. But this miss's fate was too thin. Before long, this crazy miss was evicted from the hotel by the owner and wandered the streets of Chongqing. At first, she was still seen begging along the street, but later she gradually disappeared. When everyone saw her on the street, who could have thought that she was the beauty that thousands of people were pursuing twenty years ago?</p>
<h3 id="e167">Quiet Baoshan City <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Baoshan, 2nd Dispatch Zhong Ying</p>
<p>Baoshan has no mountains, but is an ancient, desolate, and desolate small county town. It squats quietly every day at the end of the Yangtze River, where the water and the sky are the same color. Its shape is square, like a piece of dried tofu. That kind of humble and embarrassing situation is very pathetic. You see, the city gates are old and broken, the city walls are thin and low, the battlements have collapsed, and the whole body is full of bullet marks. Indeed, it is a patient who has been through thick and thin and is covered with scars. It has been subjected to the tyranny of artillery fire, it has been subjected to the abuse of massacre, it has climbed out of the tiger's mouth, and it has jumped out of the devil's clutches.</p>
<p>Victory Park, Martyrs' Shrine Stele</p>
<p>If you walk into the city, you will definitely be startled, because the city is full of rubble, broken walls and ruins, which are all eye-catching. We can very well use the words "wild smoke and weeds fly together, courtyard mice and wild rabbits gallop" to describe him. This is not my excessive description, nor is it my good at publicity. You only need to look at the Baoshan County Martyrs' Tongbei Record written by Mr. Yuan Xiluo in Victory Park in Baoshan City, and you can be convinced of it. The most alarming part of the inscription is the following passage of fact:</p>
<p>"...On January 28, 1932, the Japanese sent troops to invade my Baoshan, Shanghai. The officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army stationed in Shanghai, motivated by righteous indignation, rose up to resist the enemy, and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese for a month and five days. 30,000 brave men were killed and wounded more than 20,000, with lack of equipment and no assistance, they retreated to Liuhuo, and the entire county fell for three months. The houses in the county seat and Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhabei, and the city that were destroyed by artillery fire were five or six out of ten. Tens of thousands of people were killed and injured..." This was the first great catastrophe of Baoshan, but soon the "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War broke out again in 1937. This war was even more fierce than the last one. Now let us continue to read the inscription.</p>
<p>"...On August 13 (according to 1937), the Japanese attacked my Wusong and Shanghai with land, sea, and air forces. Our army fought a bloody battle with the enemy for three months. There were not enough weapons and ammunition, and 300,000 people were killed and wounded. The entire county fell again, and Shanghai fell..." This was the second great catastrophe of Baoshan. It can be said that the war was shocking to the world and weeping to the gods. The loss was huge and difficult to calculate. Therefore, Baoshan, a small county town, not only became famous throughout the country, but also reached the world and knew its great name. Baomen can very well imagine and foresee that its desolation and desolation are indeed inevitable.</p>
<p>Difficult Transportation, Insufficient Rice Supply</p>
<p>Baoshan borders the river, half surrounded by the river, and is tightly surrounded by the river, so the east gate is the river, and the north gate is also the river. Only the south gate can lead to Wusong, and the west gate can lead to towns such as Yuepu and Luodian. The transportation is not very convenient, especially after the previous great catastrophes, the roads were completely destroyed. Because of the financial difficulties, they have not been repaired yet. There are no business or government-run cars running on the road. What you see is only the bicycles that are flying like arrows and flowing endlessly. Originally, bicycles were very popular in Baoshan. Whether it is an old man or a little girl, they can ride. They not only ride bicycles back and forth between Wusong, Yuepu, Luodian and other places, but also go to Shanghai, which is very far away, in the morning and return in the evening, which is common. Therefore, in the case of difficult transportation, bicycles have become their only tool.</p>
<p>The soil of Baoshan is completely sandy and is not suitable for planting rice, but can only grow cotton, so it is a cotton-producing area. There is a great shortage of rice, and most of it relies on supply from other ports. Therefore, the price of rice is more expensive than in any other place. At this time when the price of rice is as expensive as pearls and the price of firewood is as expensive as cinnamon, and everything is rising, how can the poor people think of a way to survive? According to the survey, very few people in this place eat white rice. Most of them eat wheat rice cooked with wheat and brown rice. The yellow and coarse rice makes us want to vomit, but they swallow it regardless of everything.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Today's View of Cancer <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Zengyi</p>
<p>The term "cancer," which is not new but extremely terrible, is probably widely noticed. Indeed, it is a killer that does not blink an eye and is full of terrifying terminal illnesses. According to a report from the National Cancer Institute in the United States, on average, one person dies from this terrible disease every three minutes. Although there are no reliable records in our country, I think it will not be less than this number. From this, we can know that it is a huge loss to national production and national economy.</p>
<p>Although this disease existed in the "prehistoric period," it was only in recent centuries that its universality has been recognized by medical professionals. In our daily consultation and other experiences, the chance of encountering cancer every day seems to be increasing. However, this does not mean that there were absolutely few cancer patients in the past: this is the credit of many pathologists and clinical researchers, so that the symptoms of this disease can be recognized early and correctly, so as not to be ignored. Now, not to mention doctors, even ordinary people with a relatively high level of health and medical knowledge can suspect the possibility of cancer. However, there are not many people who know the general idea of its causes, characteristics, and no hope of cure. I will elaborate on these points here.</p>
<p>In a broad sense, cancer is a type of tumor, that is, what is commonly known as a malignant tumor. It is the abnormal growth of certain body cells, the loss of control, so that it erodes and damages the growth or function of normal cells or neighboring tissues, eventually leading to the consumption of human nutrition and even death. The speed of its growth, the distance of its migration, and the size of its spread are all beyond human control. Even if this tumor is completely removed, it cannot permanently prevent its speed from migrating in any case. For example, although rectal cancer has been surgically removed, it may still migrate to unrelated organs such as the liver. According to this view, this is purely caused by abnormal cells. If we want to study its treatment plan, we must first thoroughly investigate its causes and roots, why cells become abnormal, and the difference between normal cells and cancer cells. Then, the symptomatic treatment of cancer may be possible.</p>
<p>Not a Contagious Disease</p>
<p>Many people still think that cancer is contagious, but so far there is no precedent for doctors, nurses or family members of patients being infected with the same disease due to contact. Some people even inoculated the tissue of patients diagnosed as cancer by biopsy under the skin, but there was no cancer phenomenon after decades. In the past 100 years, Dutch guinea pigs and rabbits have been used as experimental animals, and there is no evidence of contagion. At present, the cause of cancer is non-contagious. It is caused by the congenital or acquired increase in the sensitivity of human cells to cancer, or by the erosion of carcinogens (Car inogan) in its suitable environment. The influence of heredity is also a major inducement. There are often families in which several generations suffer from cancer (the location and nature may be different). The reason can be explained by the specific or particularly sensitive receptivity of cells. Twins who are completely identical in embryology have many opportunities to develop similar cancers at the same time. From this, it can be known that if the genetic influence is similar, the sensitivity of cells to cancer is also the same. If the genetic influence is different in different families, the cell sensitivity is also different. Even the sensitivity of the same person to various cancers changes from time to time in his life, with no rules to follow.</p>
<p>Alarming Mortality Rate</p>
<p>What is even more unspeakable is that ordinary people often think that cancer is a disease that is easy to suffer from after middle age. However, according to statistics from the American Cancer Research Institute, in 1942, more children under the age of five died from cancer than from acute nephritis or infantile paralysis. In the same year, among children aged 5 to 9 and 10 to 14, the cancer mortality rate was higher than that of dysentery, pertussis, diphtheria, or measles. Therefore, although cancer is more common in middle-aged and elderly patients because of more opportunities to contact carcinogens, its harm to infants, even if not much, is truly unheard of.</p>
<p>The progress of medical science in recent years is not insignificant. Taking the four major diseases of human beings as an example, inflammation has both sulfonamide preparations and penicillin. Although it cannot be said to be effective in all cases, at least it should be more than 70% sure. As for tuberculosis, which is no less harmful than cancer, there are also antibiotics such as Streptothnicin. Although it has not been successful in clinical practice, at least there is already a glimmer of hope. And the tuberculosis treatment invented in Taiwan recently is also booming with unlimited prospects. Only the effective treatment of cancer, which is the most harmful and serious, is still lacking. Everyone is very concerned about its success, and medical scientists and scientists in various countries are sparing no effort to research it. Is there any hope of success? I will also briefly explain it here.</p>
<p>No Effective Drug</p>
<p>To study the treatment of cancer, some people think that we must first find an animal that has absolutely no cancer tendency or very little cancer, and then analyze it to study the differences between this kind of animal and animals that are particularly susceptible to cancer, or to find out the difference in their resistance and sensitivity to carcinogenic substances, and then have a way to improve or correct it. Unfortunately, cancer is prevalent in various domestic animals, animals, frogs, fish, chickens and mice. Even in plants, there is a disease similar to cancer. So the effort in this area has failed so far.</p>
<p>Secondly, some people began to pay attention to the time factor required from the time when they were eroded by carcinogens to the time when cancer first appeared. According to someone's statistics, one person changed to another industry after working for different periods of time (especially aniline dyes), and the water did not contact this carcinogen, but he or she may develop bladder cancer after one to seventeen years. X-ray doctors, nurses, or technicians may develop skin cancer one to eleven years after the last contact. Cancer can appear at the affected area one month to two years after a single burn. Therefore, the occurrence of cancer can be divided into long-distance and shortcuts. Sometimes, a primary cancer can produce a large group of secondary cancers in other places, while sometimes it does not. Some grow rapidly, while others grow very slowly. There may be a recessive period of slow growth in the middle, followed by rapid migration or spread. Some will enter the recessive period forever, and a very small number can enter the stationary period and disappear completely. Therefore, there must be some mysterious substances in our body that accelerate, slow down or resist the occurrence of cancer, or there must be favorable or unfavorable environments that affect its growth. If this mystery can be broken, the treatment of cancer will enter a new era.</p>
<p>Research on Carcinogens</p>
<p>The third is the research on carcinogens. We already know that even the most ordinary sunlight, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and other radioactive substances, as well as several coal tar dyes, especially aniline, are well-known exogenous carcinogens. Genetic factors or special sensitivity to carcinogens are all endogenous carcinogens. Even if the endogenous ones cannot be removed, the exogenous ones can be avoided as much as possible, so that the possibility of cancer will be reduced.</p>
<p>In short, cancer is by no means an incurable disease. If the spirit, material resources, and manpower of the atomic bomb research can be used properly, then with the rapid development of medical science, the early effective treatment of cancer is hoped for. However, at present, we should do our best to avoid suffering from this terrible disease. If you have this disease, you should ask a scientific doctor for early diagnosis and reasonable treatment as soon as possible, so that at least life can be extended and pain can be reduced. Do not delay the opportunity for treatment and cause yourself trouble. There are often patients who neglect to delay the early operable gastric cancer for a long time, until it migrates to the liver, peritoneum, etc., and produces jaundice ascites before seeking medical treatment, then the time for timely surgical treatment has passed, and the treatment results are naturally not the same as those who had early diagnosis and reasonable treatment. If this is the case, the treatment of cancer depends on the mutual cooperation between the patient and the doctor, and it will be successful. If one party neglects, the efforts will be in vain.</p>

<h3 id="e169">An Open Letter to All Fellow Tuberculosis Patients <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Shaoqing</p>
<p>For the past few months, I have received inquiries from patients in various regions regarding their opinions on the various new tuberculosis drugs that have appeared on the market recently. Fearing that I cannot answer each one individually, I am taking this opportunity to provide a more detailed explanation in this column, offering sincere advice and hoping for your careful consideration!</p>
<p>Over the past century, countries around the world have spared no effort in exploring new drugs for treating tuberculosis. Almost every year, new drugs have been introduced. To date, there are countless varieties, ranging from chemical drugs and metallic preparations to bacterial vaccines and antitoxic bacterial solutions. More recently, we have seen Diason, Promin, Promizole, Stepharanthin, and Streptomycin, among others. The sheer number and variety are overwhelming. Each time a new drug is launched, manufacturers worldwide compete to promote it, and patients generally place great hope in it, believing that an effective medicine has finally been invented, allowing them to be cured and escape their suffering! However, before long, they find themselves wasting money and regretting their decision, as such cases are all too common.</p>
<p>Regarding any tuberculosis drug, there are three aspects worth researching before it is used on humans, which I will elaborate on below:</p>
<p>(1) Toxicity of the Drug: Before any drug is used, it should first be tested on animals to determine its toxicity, pharmacological effects, and dosage, including the effective dose, maximum dose, toxic dose, and lethal dose. Only after it has been proven effective and non-toxic should it be tested on humans.</p>
<p>(2) The Bactericidal Power of the Drug Against Tuberculosis Bacteria: This must be studied and explored by bacteriologists to be reliable. Often, a drug may effectively control or kill tuberculosis bacteria cultured in a test tube. However, it may prove ineffective when tested on animals. Furthermore, some drugs may kill tuberculosis bacteria cultured in a test tube and show promising results in animal experiments, such as improving symptoms, inhibiting the disease, and reducing mortality rates. However, when used on humans, they may ultimately fail in clinical practice. For example, the newly developed Streptomycin and Diason in the United States were studied by American specialists, and the results showed that they could control the reproduction of tuberculosis bacteria cultured in test tubes. Subsequent animal experiments also proved that they had relatively good results. However, even after their use on patients, there is no universally recognized effective function to this day. On the contrary, this hope is gradually fading, but research and improvement are ongoing. This is because the human body's cellular tissues, its internal resistance mechanisms, and its natural immune factors are very different from those of experimental animals. What works in animals may not necessarily work in humans. Therefore, to determine whether a drug is effective, one must carefully observe its performance in test tubes, after animal experiments, and in clinical applications on patients. One cannot take things out of context and generalize.</p>
<p>(3) The Efficacy of the Drug on Tuberculosis: After a patient takes a new tuberculosis drug, it is essential to study whether the tuberculous lesions in their body are gradually improving, whether there is any progress after repeated X-ray examinations, whether the patient's general health condition has improved significantly after taking the drug, and whether the tuberculosis bacteria in the sputum have decreased. All of these are standards for measuring the efficacy of tuberculosis treatment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, before a new tuberculosis drug is launched, it should be carefully examined and thoroughly researched in the three aspects mentioned above. I dare not introduce it lightly. If patients purchase and take drugs on their own without being able to detect signs of poisoning, and rely on luck, the risk is even greater. In short, these so-called miracle drugs are still in the experimental stage and have not yet moved beyond animal and clinical trials. In today's age of scientific advancement, the methods we generally recognize for treating tuberculosis are still aimed at increasing the human body's resistance, stabilizing the affected area of the lungs, and performing various surgeries aimed at compressing the lungs. The methods vary, but the key is to choose wisely. If the disease has progressed to a late stage, the affected area is extensive, and the patient's general resistance is declining, even the best methods may be ineffective! I hope that patients will pay attention, avoid easily believing manufacturers' advertising, and being misled by them. Losing money is a small matter, but damaging one's health is something to regret.</p>
<h3 id="e170">A Brief Discussion on Leprosy <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Qixian</p>
<p>Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The most severely affected tissues are the skin and nerves. The symptoms vary widely, including local numbness, rashes, nodules, ulcers, and disabilities. Leprosy is widespread throughout the world, and is most easily propagated in tropical, temperate, and humid regions. In China, it is more common in Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Jiangsu, and less common in the north, except for Shandong. The methods of transmission are theoretically inconsistent, but most are due to contact with patients, coupled with other contributing factors such as poor nutrition, poverty, hunger and cold, humid living conditions, and large populations. People between the ages of ten and forty are more susceptible to the disease, and men are more likely to contract it than women. The incubation period of leprosy is quite long, ranging from a few months to several decades, with an average of about two to four years. In 1931, Mr. Wu Deyi of the West divided leprosy into the following three categories:</p>
<p>A. Neural Leprosy: This category includes all cases where the nerves have suffered damage from leprosy, such as sensory abnormalities, changes in pigmentation and circulation, nutritional disturbances, paralysis, atrophy, and ulcers.</p>
<p>B. Cutaneous Leprosy: This category includes all cases where the skin has suffered damage from leprosy. It can be divided into three types according to the severity of the damage.</p>
<p>C. Mixed Leprosy: A combination of both types.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Leprosy</p>
<p>A. Initial Symptoms: Leprosy is not easily recognized in its early stages. Sometimes, it begins with fever, headache, back pain, poor digestion, and lethargy. Occasionally, rashes appear on the skin at the same time, or a particular part of the body may be especially painful and sweat less. After a month and a half, the symptoms of leprosy become fully apparent, and one finally realizes what it is.</p>
<p>B. Cutaneous Leprosy: In the early stages, small patches of skin exhibit rash-like spots that are not easily noticed. One does not seek medical attention until many areas of the face and limbs appear. These rashes are congestive, initially appearing purplish-red and then coffee-colored, with a slightly wrinkled, scaly surface that is thick and slightly raised at the edges. They gradually merge, resembling ring-shaped or lobed patterns. Subsequently, the skin gradually becomes rough, and nodules may form, taking several months to several years. Eventually, the face becomes covered with nodules, making it difficult to recognize, resembling a lion's face. If the nasal mucosa or skin is examined, Mycobacterium leprae can be seen in 80-90% of cases.</p>
<p>C. Neural Leprosy: It also begins with rashes, but they are larger than those of cutaneous leprosy. Pigmentation changes occur early. The center of the rash gradually loses color, becoming pale and numb, while the edges expand. At this time, the nerves experience tingling, pain, itching, and reduced sweating. Over time, nutrition is impaired, the muscles in the affected area atrophy, and sensory abnormalities occur. The cervical nerves become noticeably thickened. Eventually, ulcers form, and even the hands and feet may fall off. Patients may experience pain day and night, and various complications such as keratitis, laryngitis, and pneumonia may arise spontaneously.</p>
<p>Prevention of Leprosy</p>
<p>The method of prevention is aimed at preventing the invasion of bacteria and inhibiting their development. Apart from what humans can do, such as preventing natural disasters, the steps for prevention are divided into individual and public:</p>
<p>A. Individual Prevention:</p>
<p>First, emphasize cleanliness: Mycobacterium leprae mainly invades through the skin, so keeping the skin clean is essential.</p>
<p>Second, be mindful of nutrition: Poor nutrition easily causes disease, and leprosy is no exception.</p>
<p>Third, do not overdo it: Whether it is work, play, or diet, do not overdo it to avoid reducing the body's resistance.</p>
<p>Fourth, avoid contact: Skin rashes and nodules in the early stages of leprosy are highly contagious, accounting for more than 90% of cases.</p>
<p>B. Public Prevention:</p>
<p>It depends on everyone's cooperation to improve people's lives, instill health knowledge, establish specialized institutions to educate talent to study the development, treatment, and prevention of the disease, investigate leprosy areas, examine suspected patients, and treat and isolate those diagnosed with the disease.</p>
<p>As for the treatment of leprosy, preparations of chaulmoogra oil are commonly administered by intramuscular injection for several months or years. Whether the disease improves depends entirely on the severity of the symptoms and the patient's ability to patiently receive treatment.</p>
<p>New Medical Insights</p>
<h3 id="e171">Another New Antimalarial Drug <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>During the war, the United States engaged in antimalarial drug research with government support. Under the direction of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), the Board for Coordination of Malarial Studies was organized, uniting national public and private research institutions to engage in this research. Over the years, a total of more than seven million U.S. dollars has been spent on the research of tens of thousands of drugs. The last issue of this publication already reported on Chloroquine (or Chloroquinol), referred to as SN7618 in the order of research. On October 12, Dr. R.F. Loed, chairman of the Board, also reported a new antimalarial drug, referred to as SN13,276 in order, named Pentaguine, representing another major advance in antimalarial drug research. It is said that tertian malaria is not easily cured. After treatment with quinine or Atabrine, more than 60% of patients relapse, and some as high as 90%. When combined with these two drugs, Paludrine can indeed reduce the relapse rate, but many patients still relapse, and its toxicity is very high. Improper use can easily lead to malaria. The antimalarial efficacy of Pentaguine in chicken malaria experiments is 80 times that of quinine and 8 times that of Paludrine, but its toxicity to mice is only one-third that of Paludrine. Therefore, its efficacy and safety are better than Paludrine. According to clinical experiments, if Pentaguine is used at 60 mg per day (equivalent to 80 mg of its phosphate) and quinine at 2 grams per day, once every four hours, for 14 consecutive days, it can cure severe tertian malaria and prevent its recurrence. However, the daily dose of this drug should not exceed 60 mg and should be used under the supervision of a doctor, as its clinical application has not yet moved beyond the experimental stage.</p>
<h3 id="e172">New Case of Cured Tuberculous Meningitis <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Shao</p>
<p>Tuberculous meningitis is a serious disease, with a mortality rate of almost 100%. Although the literature contains reports of approximately 60 recovery cases, the diagnosis in many of these cases is questionable. Cooke et al. first reported earlier this year that tuberculous meningitis in a one-year-old infant was cured with streptomycin. In September, Keefer et al. reported four cases of this disease cured with streptomycin. However, the various neurological sequelae left after the cure of each case mean that the ultimate prognosis cannot be considered good.</p>
<p>Recently, Krefchik of New Jersey reported in the October 19 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association a case that was completely cured after streptomycin treatment, with no residual symptoms, which is particularly noteworthy. The patient was a 15-month-old boy, diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis, who began streptomycin treatment two weeks after contracting the disease. The treatment lasted a total of 57 days, with a total streptomycin dose of 24 million units by intramuscular injection and 2.8 million units by intrathecal injection (65 spinal taps).</p>
<h3 id="e173">Soviet Russia Values Lysozyme <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Shao</p>
<p>Lysozyme was discovered by British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming in 1921, before he discovered penicillin. This element has a very strong and rapid bacteriolytic effect, but its effect on common pathogenic bacteria is weak. Therefore, Fleming quickly abandoned it and did not continue to study it. Few scholars have paid attention to it since. However, just as scholars at Oxford were re-examining Fleming's discovery of penicillin, Soviet scholars became interested in lysozyme, and its use was not limited to medicine but also used in industry.</p>
<p>The lysozyme used in the Soviet Union is mainly made from chicken egg white, and sometimes from red or white grapes. It is said to be able to kill streptococci and staphylococci, and to inhibit the reproduction of dysentery bacilli, typhoid bacilli, and cholera vibrios.</p>
<p>Clinically, it is mainly used for infectious wounds, especially for the prevention and treatment of corneal wound infections, and also for preparation before skin grafting. According to Voronova's report, this element is also very effective for childhood diarrhea.</p>
<p>In industry, its crude products are used in the manufacture of caviar. Fish eggs washed with its solution can be kept fresh for up to a year, and the solution is also used to soak hemp, making the fibers easier to separate.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Chen Shuren, the Immortal in Painting <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>From December 5th to 11th, 1946, Mr. Chen Shuren, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, held an exhibition at the Cultural Hall in Xiangpu Camp, Nanjing, displaying his works from before and after the War of Resistance, including portraits, landscapes, birds, animals, fish, insects, and sketches of the Pearl River, the Yangtze River, and famous scenic spots in Sichuan. It was truly a grand spectacle! Unfortunately, I am still detained in Shanghai, and I may not be able to participate in this grand event. Perhaps the Central University will officially start classes within these six days, and I will be able to go to Nanjing to see Chen Shuren and his works again.</p>
<p>I say "see again" for a reason. Back in 1935 and 1936, in order to prepare "Chen Shuren's Recent Works" (The Commercial Press), which was included in the "Sino-French Cultural Undertakings," I met with Chen Shuren almost every day to discuss the contents of the collection: selecting paintings, making plates, explaining, and writing the preface. Chen Shuren is a very free and easy person, and I myself don't understand social niceties. To put it bluntly, we became kindred spirits despite the age difference! At that time, the weather was very cold, and Chen Shuren often took his whole family and me to small restaurants to eat hot pot or Mongolian hot pot. Since the War of Resistance, Chen Shuren's demeanor has remained the same, but the author's hair has turned white, and he has lost the leisurely mood of those years! This "Chen Shuren's Recent Works" was originally prepared for Chinese and foreign audiences, so it has a rather long Chinese preface and a French preface, as well as a French explanation added before each painting. The printing was the best of all the color prints of The Commercial Press. Mr. Wang Yunwu certainly knows this very well. This collection received unanimous praise from critics at home and abroad, which also reflects the high quality of Chen Shuren's paintings. Next, I prepared "Zhang Shuyi's Recent Works" and contacted "Xu Beihong's Recent Works." After Zhang Shuyi's paintings were selected, they were reviewed by Mr. Wang Yunwu, and the paintings were stored in The Commercial Press. The "August 13 Incident" broke out, and everything became a bubble! However, what is gratifying is that in recent years, Zhang Shuyi's paintings have made rapid progress. At the Chinese Academy of Art in Panxi, opposite the Jialing River in Chongqing, Xu Beihong personally agreed to me participating in the set of books. In addition, I also planned to prepare "Qi Baishi's Recent Works," "Zhang Daqian's Recent Works," "Wang Yachen's Recent Works," etc. I sincerely hope that Mr. Zhu Jingnong, who succeeded Mr. Wang Yunwu as the head of The Commercial Press, will fulfill this scholar's grand wish to serve the country as soon as the economic situation improves!</p>
<p>I am most afraid of seeing high officials, because they are somewhat abnormal physically and psychologically: their eyes are higher than those of ordinary people, and their skeletons are also larger than ours (but they suffer from severe rickets). They speak in a bureaucratic tone, and the vocabulary they use is different from ours. They are somewhat like the smiling ghosts described in anecdotal novels! Chen Shuren was once a high official, an important person; but today, he is still a high official who does not hold the power of life and death. He is always smiling, but he is not a ghost! He is like a crane, he is like a plum blossom, he is like a lotus flower that grows out of mud without being stained. He is noble, natural, kind, and approachable, without any hint of worldliness, and even less the behavior of an artistic nouveau riche. Anyone who has been close to Chen Shuren will agree with my statement.</p>
<p>Words are the voice of the heart, and paintings are the shadow of the heart. Chen Shuren's paintings resemble Chen Shuren's personality. No matter what painting material Chen Shuren takes, what his paintings show is a piece of serenity. Even if he paints a ferocious beast, the picture will never be tense. This sentence, at first hearing, seems to be a subtle criticism; but after careful study, it is not. Let us put aside painting for the time being and talk about the reality of nature: if you face the head of a lion (this is the head of an African lion, but a specimen) and look at it for a moment, you will find that its expression is very serene: the lion is the king of beasts, and it is enough to resist all violent attacks, so why be nervous? Therefore, great wisdom seems foolish, and great courage seems cowardly, but it is not true foolishness or true cowardice. The serenity of Chen Shuren's paintings is not lifeless. Chen Shuren mostly uses bright colors; "bright" color is not necessarily a "warm" color. Those who love to use bright colors are often people with broad minds and no ink hindrance: Chen Shuren is like this. Sometimes, the colors Chen Shuren uses are extremely bright, but he can avoid vulgarity and give people a sense of spiritual sunshine.</p>
<p>Chen Shuren wants to build a house on the banks of West Lake and spend the rest of his life painting. When will this beautiful dream be realized? I will follow him around, strolling on the Su and Bai embankments, and exhale the worldliness accumulated in my chest.</p>

<h3 id="e177">A Casual Talk on Female Writers <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Yi</p>
<p>Zhao Qingge, a "Remarkable Woman"</p>
<p>In the current literary scene, in terms of provinces and regions, there are too few female writers from Henan. Apart from Feng Yuanjun from Tanghe, Zhao Qingge from Xinyang should be considered unique in the literary world. In terms of the number of works, although Feng is older than Zhao, Zhao's plays, novels, and essays to date, except for "Shuang Su Shuang Fei" serialized in Shen Bao which has not yet been published, have no less than twenty single editions.</p>
<p>Speaking of Zhao Qingge's works, of course, plays are the best. Among the plays, "Tao Li Chunfeng," which won the Ministry of Education's award and was selected as one of the four excellent plays, co-authored with Lao She, is the most valued. But in my personal opinion, "Tao Li Chunfeng" is not as rich in literary meaning as "Sheng Si Lian." "Sheng Si Lian" depicts a female actor who, for the sake of justice, uses her intelligence and beauty to play with important members of the puppet organization while protecting patriotic underground workers, eventually sacrificing her life for her country and love. She writes the heroine just right. It neither falls into the nest of anti-Japanese stereotypes, nor does Zhu write her as a knight in a detective novel who appears and disappears mysteriously. And the plot is tense and lively, tortuous and interesting. In the end, it is allowed to move people to tears.</p>
<p>According to her self-introduction in "Sheng Si Lian," the script has been revised three times and revised four times. After its publication, various places in the rear scrambled to stage it. Since then, she has continued to write several plays with anti-Japanese, educational, and love themes. In her plays, they are full of the beautiful, gentle, and delicate warmth of girls. Of course, with her background and personality, the articles she writes will never have those arrogant, fiery things. And people who do not know her, only read her works, always think that she has been tumbling in the love field, and has tasted the honey or bitter water of love in order to appreciate the taste of it. In fact, she is a typical northern lady. Not only does she not have a lover, but she is also very measured in social situations. Although she has many friends in the literary world, whether young, old, colorful, or colorless, she interacts with them. But, she can maintain her purity, maintain her own position, and will never be influenced by anyone or any objective environment. It is precisely because of this reason that she can be loved in all aspects.</p>
<p>Although she is from Henan, she left Henan very early. When she was in her teens, she took a pen from Kaifeng to Shanghai, reading and writing articles, and supporting herself with her own labor until now. Because she does not rely on any political forces, nor does she need anyone's economic assistance, her life was very bitter during the War of Resistance, but her spirit was very happy. After receiving royalties and royalties, she bought a bottle of fine wine and invited a few literary friends, no matter whether they were men or women, and drank to their heart's content. She has never realized that she is a girl, especially when she is with old people, when she drinks a few more cups, she becomes more excited and unrestrained.</p>
<p>In addition to drinking, she also loves to eat good tea and good cigarettes. This may be related to her writing life, without cigarettes, tea and wine, she is simply like losing her life. Therefore, almost 60% of her royalty income is consumed on these three things.</p>
<p>Tian Han once gave a poem to her when he was in Beibei, Sichuan. It is still hanging in her Shanghai writing office. The poem says:</p>
<p>"Since ancient times, there have been many strange men in the Zhao family, and Qingge is as graceful as a strong man. She wears a hat without makeup, and can talk about armaments while drinking. How can she know the warmth and coldness of the spring water, and not know the bitterness and sweetness of camellia. Dare to seek painting materials in Jialing, and play cotton like rain in the big Henan."</p>
<p>Can be used as a portrait of Qingge. At that time, she was editing "Dan Hua Wenyi" and had a great liking for men's clothing.</p>
<p>Recently, she adapted "Dream of the Red Chamber" into four plays. Three of them have been published, and the fourth is serialized in Wen Chao Monthly. According to her, she will change her style and engage in long novels from now on.</p>
<p>Judging from the few long creations she has published, such as "Feng" and "Yue Shang Liu Shao Tou," I believe her achievements are always greater than plays.</p>
<p>Recently, she became a teacher of Qi Baishi. A newspaper said that she would give up writing and engage in painting. In fact, the word "learning" is quite inappropriate, because she can paint, and the style is very high, but she is not willing to write easily. Few people have seen her works except for one or two close friends.</p>
<p>In addition, she can sing Peking Opera, has written Pingju scripts, and has served as the director of the Central Youth Pingju Troupe. She has composed songs for Tianyi Film Company. Fewer people know about these things.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a joke. A reader, because he admired her works, specially wrote a letter to her to pay tribute, the opening sentence was "My beloved Qing Weng Lao Fuzi" It turned out that this person looked at her name and mistakenly thought that she was an "old" gentleman with high morals and respect, but in fact she is still in her prime, and in terms of talent and appearance, I am afraid that few contemporary female writers can compare with her.</p>

<p>— Tianxing</p>
<p>When I was studying at China Public Institute in Shanghai, the most unforgettable person for me was Mr. Hu Puan. He was from Jing County, Anhui Province, and is now over seventy years old. He has a full face of beard and whiskers, loves to drink heartily, and is not only a national studies expert but also proficient in Tai Chi.</p>
<p>Although he had held high-ranking positions for several years, such as a specialized member of the Examination Yuan and the Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, he is now still penniless and continues to live by writing and teaching.</p>
<p>This teacher Hu is a nationally renowned scholar, but his background is not what people usually imagine: not from a family of scholars with a long tradition of learning, but in reality, he was an apprentice. He told me this:</p>
<p>"In my childhood, I was an apprentice in a shop because my family was very poor. At that time, I was only a teenager. Besides doing my duties in the shop, I stole time to read. Although I had no teachers or friends to guide me, I always felt that reading was beneficial. Regardless of whether I understood it or not, I just read diligently. Eventually, I was able to read a little. At this time, I clearly understood that if I wanted to develop in the future, the first step was to seek knowledge, so I read very diligently. I was even scolded by my boss for reading at night and became seriously ill several times. An opportunity came when a relative introduced me to work as a proofreader in a bookstore. I was so happy then. Of course, proofreading was a very hard job, but I always endured the hardship and continued to work. I gained a lot of knowledge from this proofreading job and read a lot of books. At this time, I felt that I had some formal access to learning. In my spare time, I also wrote poems and essays and submitted them for publication. Some were published, so I worked even harder at writing, and I have been doing so continuously for decades. Later, I often worked as an editor in a bookstore, as a primary school teacher, a middle school teacher, and a university teacher. I also served as the administrative head of a province. After that, I decided not to be an official anymore because being an official requires betraying one's conscience, so I continued to write articles and teach, which was more in line with my nature."</p>
<p>If we carefully think about the above words, we can see that this teacher Hu struggled out of poverty, and that kind of hard-working spirit is worthy of admiration!</p>
<p>In summary, Teacher Hu is currently serving as the lead writer for the "Min Guo Daily." He works from eight in the morning until eight in the evening every day. What do young people think of this spirit of being vigorous in old age?</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Turning past the screen, two heavily made-up young women raised an exquisite bamboo curtain. Tsurumi stepped up two steps. As soon as he entered the door, he saw another pair of gorgeously dressed young women inside, one on each side, already prostrate on the ground, seemingly unwilling to get up. Tsurumi now saw clearly what was meant by gorgeously dressed: it was actually two-thirds of a palace dress. Because Konoe had a bit of aristocratic blood, he liked to create a "royal" atmosphere. If it weren't already past noon and the location was close to the sea, with a very cool climate, asking these women to wear such long robes and short jackets, with such large bundles on their backs in such hot weather would be a sin.</p>
<p>This was a very spacious hall, only a little too low. The entire room, except for the electric lights and fans, was decorated in Japanese style. Right in the center, facing the front, was a huge round door. The upper and lower four corners were fitted with extremely beautiful carved lattices, with very elegant colors. In the center of the door lintel hung a plaque about three or four feet wide, somewhat like the hanging area of a Chinese doctor or the sign in the back of a shop. On the plaque, in large, powerful characters that were neither regular nor cursive, were the words "Eternal Military Fortune," written in a lively and vigorous style, only a little crude. On either side of the round flower door hung a couplet, the two most satisfying five-character lines of Ito Hirobumi, the chief culprit of the invasion of the mainland: "Drunk, pillow on a beauty's lap," "Awake, hold the power of the world!" Inside the round door, more than ten feet deep, was another six-panel screen depicting a sunrise landscape with figures.</p>
<p>Inside this door, in front of the screen, was an antique horizontal couch bed with short legs, and in front of the bed were some tea tables. On one of the tea tables near the couch was a set of wine utensils that looked like foreign children's toys. The wine pot was not a pot, but an antique vase-style thing, and the wine cup was so small that it was only enough for less than half a mouthful. To the left and right of the couch knelt another pair of young women, of course, painted red, white, and black - red was rouge, white was lead powder, and black was their thick eyebrows and high-up hairstyles. Two women, one strumming one playing a Wuqin,</p>
<p>On the bed, wearing a house robe and a very broad, very antiquated kimono, lay a man in his fifties. One hand held an ancient thread-bound book, a foot and a half long, and the other hand held the toy-like small wine cup. This was Konoe, the culprit who launched the invasion of the mainland. At this moment, he lay there, perfectly imitating the "refined and profound" and "romantic" appearance of a famous person in ancient paintings. It is said that his national plans were conceived in this state.</p>
<p>When Tsurumi entered this door, the person accompanying or escorting him lightly whispered a word or two to the two women outside the door and slipped away quietly. The two women crawling on the ground inside the room did not raise their heads until Tsurumi reached their sides. They stole a glance at Tsurumi, quickly kowtowed three or four times, then stood up, one on each side, sideways, crouching, and followed behind Tsurumi.</p>
<p>It was about twenty or thirty feet from the doorway to the round door. Tsurumi walked all the way without making any sound because his leather shoes had been taken off, leaving only his socks. The two women were wearing wooden-soled "Geta". Moreover, it was not like the tatami in ordinary people's shops. On top of the tatami was a mat woven from Taiwanese dragon grass, woven into one large sheet according to the size of the entire room, with various patterns and designs. In such hot weather, walking on it made his feet feel soft and cool, and it felt exceptionally comfortable. Of course, no footsteps were heard.</p>

<p>A good poem not only shows us the reality before our eyes but also shows us the distant views that our sight cannot reach.</p>
<p>Reading a poem is like eating an olive, the more you think about it, the more it has an aftertaste; or like listening to a piece of music, the melodious aftersound lingering in your ears.</p>
<p>If we compare prose to a heavily made-up young woman, then poetry should be a budding maiden.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Choosing a Capital <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Before the victory of the War of Resistance, in Chongqing in the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the issue of the location of the national capital was once hotly debated. Experts, scholars, commentators, professors, and great speakers filled the newspapers and magazines with lengthy articles, and even publishing houses compiled the great works of various authors into a special collection on the national capital issue for publication.</p>
<p>Everyone's views differed. Jinan, Xi'an, Changchun, Nanjing, Beiping, Hankou, Changsha, and even Luoyang; each argument was reasonable and had its own merits, and in the end, no one recognized the correctness of others' arguments.</p>
<p>Today, less than two years later, this issue has been raised again at the National Assembly in Nanjing for heated discussion.</p>
<p>There should be a premise for this issue: if I am a native of a certain place and strive to have the capital located in that place for the benefit of that place, the motive is not very correct, and in any case, it cannot be used as information for our consideration. Because local interests and local concepts should not be mixed into the discussion of this issue.</p>
<p>Political (domestic and foreign) and economic significance will be the main factors in determining this issue. At the same time, factors such as transportation, population, climate, and culture must also be considered. As for explicitly stipulating it in the constitution, that is probably not necessary!</p>
<h3 id="e182">Surplus Materials, Slowly Transported. The Reason Is Simple - Why Worry? <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Gezhi</p>
<p>The law of supply and demand in economics states: when supply is greater than demand, prices are low; conversely, when supply is less than demand, prices are high. Anyone who knows a little about business understands this principle.</p>
<p>Reports say that there are a large number of surplus military supplies in Okinawa, left to rot in warehouses. If these materials belonged to someone else, whose country was rich in goods and had already prepared to consume them in the war against the enemy, this small amount would not matter! Besides expressing admiration and regret, what else could we do? However, when I continued to read the news, I suddenly realized that 'these materials have been sold to the Chinese National Government,' and I suddenly realized that the ownership of these things had been transferred to our government through purchase and sale. The price was 500 million US dollars. Since the transaction, it has not yet been completely shipped.</p>
<p>Judging from the price and transportation, it is conceivable that the quantity of these materials is not 'rare.' If all of it could be moved back to strengthen market supply, it would certainly be a wonderful and meaningful deal.</p>
<p>Since these surplus items have been proven to belong to us, why are we allowing them to gradually rot on an island in the Pacific while the country is suffering from poverty and the economy is declining? As a result, some people are indignant and complain about the incompetence of the authorities. I dare say that those who hold this attitude certainly do not understand the secrets of doing business. A month ago, a pound of Klennings milk powder in this city rose to 10,000 yuan, but now it can be bought for 5,400 yuan. The reason for the high price in the past and the low price now is nothing more than the law of supply and demand at work! After careful consideration, our authorities generously took out this nine-figure US dollar sum to purchase this batch of goods. The main purpose was to resell them to curb inflation. To put it bluntly, the authorities hoped to make some money in the resale to help supplement the national treasury so that fewer banknotes could be printed. Of course, the more money earned, the better. As for how to exchange goods for money, how to exchange less for more, first, you must understand the principles of buying and selling; second, you must be good at observing market changes. Why wouldn't the authorities want to immediately send dozens or even hundreds of ships to break the waves and bring back all these things belonging to our country scattered on Pacific islands? Why wouldn't they want to sell it all in one go to circulate the capital? What if the sales are poor? Why wouldn't they want to hoard them in warehouses to wait for a good price? But this is just a hope! Is this the reason why we are complaining and criticizing the authorities? Indeed, it is a loss for the materials to rot. But are we disappointed because there is a risk of loss in this transaction? I say: not necessarily! Not necessarily! What is lost is the quantity of materials. There is no impact on the cost. Why do I say that? In February of this year, a medium-sized shirt was worth only five or six thousand yuan, but now the same item cannot be obtained for less than 10,000 yuan. That is to say, one item today is worth two items in the past. Suppose the quantity of materials purchased by our country this time is a total of 10 million pieces, and at the same time, the number of losses that cannot be prevented by human efforts is 5 million pieces. Then the actual amount received is only half of the 5 million pieces. According to the thinking of people who are not familiar with buying and selling, there are 10 million items, and the cost is 500 million. If half of them are lost, it seems that there will be a real loss of 250 million! However, according to the shirt example mentioned above, after half a year or several months, there will be a shortage of goods on the market. Find the right opportunity, and one item can be sold for two items. Wouldn't it be easy to get back the capital? Maybe you can even make some profit! The authorities in charge of this transaction must understand the law of supply and demand better than we do. Even if some of these materials rot and some are brought back less, what does it matter! We only need to show faith in the authorities. In fact, there is no need to worry unnecessarily and have unwarranted pessimism! If you don't believe it, wait and see in the future, and you will know that my words are not unexpected. The reporter who reported this news also said: So far, only one ship of goods has been transported to China. The reporter may not be an expert in buying and selling!</p>
<p>People always tend to think in the worst way. Some people think that what our country has ordered is not just from Okinawa Island. Whether the situation in other places is the same as in Okinawa is not known. I also think this concern is unnecessary. To put it more emphatically, even if everything rots away, as long as one piece remains, it will be more than enough. This one remaining item, after being naturally eliminated from 10 million items, will naturally become a rare item! The authorities may as well treasure it and, after an appropriate period of time, then distribute it to us. At this time, this absolutely unique and rare treasure will be scrambled for by all 450 million compatriots, causing a sensation. Who can guarantee that there will be no enthusiastic people who will generously offer 500 million US dollars to snatch it back? The 500 million US dollars at that time is also today's 500 million US dollars. The number has not decreased, so what's the harm? Moreover, the authorities only need to send a plane and a senior official to escort it. The matter is simple, and the cost is minimal. Saving on shipping costs is also the highest principle of making a profit in buying and selling. Why should we be anxious and worried about the transportation of surplus materials?</p>

<p>A public school principal's wife buys vegetables, dipping into her husband's funds. Over time, she accumulates enough to buy a pair of cotton shoes. When the principal learns of this, he considers it embezzlement of military rations and severely rebukes her. The wife says, "This is frugality. Frugality cultivates integrity."</p>

<p>Underground work is the most fashionable term after the victory. When Tan Fuying performed "The Eight Great Hammers" at the Tianchan Theater, in the storytelling scene, when Lu Wenlong learned that Jin Wuzhu was his enemy, Fuying said in a humorous tone, "My underground work can be considered a success!"</p>
<p>The calligrapher Zhu Kongchang has recently been busy planning the Qiantang Cemetery. Someone asked him why he was so busy? He laughed, "I'm doing underground work!"</p>
<h3 id="e185">Poverty and Wealth <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Shusun Ruying</p>
<p>From Marx onwards, all the cadres in the liberated areas today have this concept: the poor are poor because they are exploited, and the rich are rich because they exploit others. This concept naturally has its theory and logic, but at least in China, the causes of poverty and wealth are not so simple.</p>
<p>Let me quote three common proverbs:</p>
<p>One generation rich, hands and feet never stop;</p>
<p>Two generations rich, chest puffed out, big belly;</p>
<p>Three generations rich, tear down the house and sell the beams and pillars. This is the language of the people, and it is definitely not a creation that bourgeois writers can produce. This proverb suggests the phenomenon of the cycle of poverty and wealth and the causes of changes in poverty and wealth, which can deeply prompt people to reflect.</p>
<p>Founders are all from the working class. Only because they are poor can they be inspired to work hard and produce diligently to reach a state of wealth. Those who enjoy the blessings of inheritance, although there are some who can safely maintain their wealth, most of the sons and daughters of the wealthy are extravagant and wasteful, and eventually become bankrupt and fall into the ranks of beggars.</p>
<p>Hartung and Luo Jialing were originally proletarians, but they eventually acquired countless properties and became very wealthy. Their wealth was due to the prosperity of Shanghai, but their diligence and frugality cannot be denied. Look at their successors, what else can they do besides suing each other for the family property? Moreover, how long can these people who enjoy the blessings of their predecessors enjoy their blessings?</p>
<p>The rich are not always rich, and the poor are not always poor. Endure a bit of hardship, and you will get a bit of enjoyment. In any world - whether it is a capitalist or socialist world - the difference in principle is very limited.</p>
<p>In an extreme capitalist world, of course, the poor will become poorer and the rich will become richer, but in China, it is really just big poverty and small poverty; and now everyone can't survive. Our problem is only: peace, unity, and getting everything back on track. Like the way it was twenty-six years ago, in the first two years, there is great hope. Struggle, etc., is the "skill" of speculators!</p>

<p>— Shigu</p>
<p>Everyone knows that blood is precious. No wonder the beauties are fighting for plasma. However, only the blood of us Chinese people does not seem very precious. Look: blood flows east, blood flows west, the more it flows, the cheaper it seems. Pig blood and sheep blood can be sold for money, but our blood is worthless.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Just This Set <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— [Liang Yushu Z] Mr. ×××, who is usually known as the "general in cloth clothes," has now bought a foreign house and a car in San Francisco. Everything in the world is just this set. Distance Makes A Difference and a Frog in a Well A reporter said, "Generally, the farther away people are from the 'liberated area,' the more they sympathize with the Communist Party, and the closer they are, the opposite is true. There is a big difference between Kunming and Tianjin." Just thinking about this a little, you will feel that it contains some truth. The Organizational Setup of Shanghai's Cross-Section Beggars Huang Jiamo Joyful events are a general term that includes weddings, marrying off daughters, birthdays, and full-moon banquets. The beggar leader has already found out the type of joyful event and determined where the banquet will be held on a certain day. The uncles and elders must bathe and change their clothes in advance, prepare the joyous banners and red candles, and go to see the treasurer of the joyous family, congratulating them repeatedly. Seeing that it is the beggar leader in his jurisdiction, the treasurer will give a reward and send him away without making things difficult. The amount of the reward money is given according to the situation. Before the war, it was usually between one and five silver dollars. After the war, it ranged from 5,000 to tens of thousands of yuan. As for the gifts sent by the beggars, they are usually returned and not accepted, which is the equivalent of a "sincere refusal of generous gifts." Anyway, both sides know what's up. The beggar gang's gifts are kept as rewards for later use. However, the gifts given for birthdays and full-moon banquets are often more generous than those given for weddings, because weddings are something that every family has to do. Birthdays and full-moon banquets are extravagant displays of wealthy families. The former are necessities, while the latter are luxuries. Moreover, because filial sons and grandsons celebrate the birthdays of their elders, they do not want beggars to come to the door and shout out inauspicious words to ruin the surrounding festive atmosphere. The beggars have studied all these things thoroughly, so they can choose the fattest prey to devour. After receiving the reward and saying thank you, the beggar leader will stick a red paper strip on the door, with the words: "Noble family's joyful event, no disturbance from the brothers!" This "no taboo" strip of paper is just like Jiang Taigong's talisman. All the beggars will avoid it. If the reward is not given, then the beggars will come to the door one after another, which will be very annoying. Funerals Funerals are divided into three types: first, setting up the mourning hall; second, the funeral procession; and third, holding the anniversary of death. Most Chinese households use Buddhist rituals and cannot avoid doing Buddhist rituals and chanting scriptures. The family especially likes to be extravagant. The beggar leader will wear plain clothes and prepare incense and candles to come to see the treasurer, putting on a mourning appearance and blessing the deceased to ascend to heaven early. The treasurer of the mourning family must still give money to send them away, but the amount is less than for joyful events. Recently, funeral parlors in Shanghai are booming, and it is quite inconvenient for beggars to come to the door because funeral parlors have always had guards, and there are many obstacles in between. The beggars cannot enter the door and often turn to the family's residence to beg bitterly. However, if the death of the family is due to an unfortunate accidental death, such as suicide or being killed, the beggars will also have to consider the situation and no longer come to the door to ask for money. For example, recently, when a major traitor was executed and a mourning hall was set up, the beggar leader in that area actually disdained to take a look. This is the clever part of the old beggar gang. In the past, the beggars would also prepare three animals as sacrificial offerings to mourn the rich, in order to ask for more considerable rewards. The family of the deceased would certainly not accept the sacrificial offerings because the beggars rented them from the butcher shop for use. This has become an open secret. Sanmao Zhang Leping</p>
