<h3>各黨派代表日內到京　政協小組凖備復會　馬歇爾周恩來等再晤談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕據邵力于所談，最近可能召開之三項會議中之政協綜合小組會議，俟留渝之中共代表必武等及民主同盟代表青年黨代表到京後，即擬舉行，原定今日來京京之中共代表董必武，何思敬，因氣候不佳，已改於十四日飛京，民主同盟代表羅隆基已由昆到渝，定廿日前米京。此外，傳將出席綜合小組會議之各黨派留滬代表，亦有於週內來京說，就各黨派代表最近之行動觀察，綜合小組會議縱有舉行可能，為期當在下週。前政治協商會議第二次大會即將召開一說，目前似已無此需要。周恩來十三日下午三時牛訪晤馬歇爾，談的一小時，聞會談內容除東北問題外，並談鄂中·華北·蘇北各地國共兩軍之情勢，周氏辭出後，據接近馬使者談，馬使至京後，已聽取政府及中共雙方之意見，至必要時，或擬藉一機會聽取中國人民之意見，因兼聽多聽不僅裨益參考，而對中國團結統一之談判亦至爲有利，聞周恩來定十四日下午三時再度訪晤馬歇爾，</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十三日電〕馬歇爾將軍與蔣主席舉行會談，並日與兪大維　商討，兪氏精通英文，致成蔣主席之媒介。「和平會談」內政　代表之一張羣將軍今日抵京，會晤中國陸軍總司令何應欽將軍。</p>
<p>〔又電〕新民報引述可靠方面稱：國共談判不久即將恢復，但政治協商會議無召集第二次會議之必要，因懸而未決之政府改組，，草及軍事問題將出由政協綜合小組，憲草審查小組及軍事三人小組討論之。馬歇爾，周恩來及白魯德三人，曾於今晨會晤，　〔路透社南京十三日電日報載二：政治協商會議之十人綜合小組委員會，將於五月二十日由邵力子召集，在南京國民大會堂開會。政府。共產黨。靑年黨。民主同盟及獨立派各派代表二名參加，又憲草審議會不久亦將重開，繼續討論，該會委員共三十五名，內五黨代表各五名，另加專家十名。</p>
<h3>美政府經濟援華　馬帥對借款傳有否決權</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京十三日電〕中國當前迫切之政治軍事問題，雖則困難重重，但解次希望仍濃厚。外間種種傳說，以爲東北局勢僵持，大規模內戰一觸即發，此蓋眛於各種事實，更不知中國人喜歡討價還價之習慣，所謂事實，的有下述兩項：</p>
<p>（一）國共兩軍十八年來原屬死敵，自一月十三日停戰令實施之後，雙方軍隊在各地對峙，相隔僅一箭之遙，除發生無可避免之小衝突外，迄未越出原防至不可收拾之境。</p>
<p>（二）國共雙方均願繼續作政治性之磋商，則可知談判之門並未關閉，折衷方案隨時可成。馬歇爾把握中國局勢，非常淸楚，非常公平。除此而外，國共雙方亦均認識，世界輿論期望中國和平民主，已有不耐之色。當記者離延安時，中共主席毛澤東曾向予稱，目前局勢雖不若一月間停戰協定，整軍方案及政治協商會談協定成立當初之佳，但渠及共黨仍樂觀。毛氏並謂，挫折固所不免，但民主與統一，勢在必行，世界大勢世界與論，以美蘇英三國爲俟順，頁有以使然</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕　今日此間消息：杜魯門總統駐草特使馬歇爾，對於五萬萬美元中國借款，具有絕對否次權。此爲美總統總來賦予特使最强大之權力，俾在外國得以推行尖國政策。據外交當局稱：杜魯門總統與國務卿貝　納斯，正擬以擬國金元擇取美國目的，中國　　實其明顯之一例。馬歇爾特使於去年十二月奉命赴華之時，杜魯門總統曾宣布美國對華經濟援助，恃乎中國內部安定之稈度。本年三月馬氏回國述職，曾與杜魯門作數次會談。中國嘗一度申請現金借款及信用放款合計二十億元，當時由國民政府與美談判，原可望獲得五億元但聞馬歇爾擬藉此拉攏國民政府與中共聯合，以增强中國實力。此項借款本已由進出口銀行備款以待，準備付出，後忽又停留不放，而以全部處理借款及中美關係其他一切權力賦與馬歇爾便宜行事。蓋當馬使回國期間，其所擬國共停止衝突及國共兩軍逐漸合併之整軍方案，竟因東北問題而致破裂。馬氏此次再度赴華，問題即在經過挫折以後，應如何恢復其調解任務。惟一有效利器厥爲操縱美國借款，至於駐華美軍現已减少至三萬人左右，僅負守衛之責而已。</p>

<h3>公務人員調整薪津辦法　原提案人發表理由　為使安心服務政府應安籌解決途徑</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕日前立法院例會通過之「公敎人員調整新津辦法」一案發表後，公敎人員頗爲關切，並粉探詢提案經過及內容，該案係立委簡比三等草擬，樓桐蓀，陳顧遠，鄒善羣，陳海澄，胡宣明等卅三人述署提出，經大會將原則通過，並由院長指定簡　三，諶小岑，李慶　等，根據各委員所發表之意見補充後，即呈請國防最高委員會從速核定，以期早日實施，茲將該案理由及辦法摘要錄後：理由：抗戰以來，公敎人員生活，因物價　漲，漫無止境，日益感受窘迫，幾至無法維持，在抗戰時期，大敵當前，勝利第一，公敎人員，仰體時艱，雖含辛茹苦，仍無怖無尤，苦幹到底，現勝利已臨，河由光優，而公敎人員生活，反比戰時更〔　　，恰念前　，殊令人惶惶不安，公敎人員買其學識精力，爲國效勞，政府自應維持其相當之生活標準，以使安心服務。還都以後，建國大業，允需公敎人員，加緊努力。政府若於此時，對于其生活問題，妥籌解決途徑，則于行政效率及敎育前途，均有莫大裨益。全人等有鑒於此，未敢緘默，謹擬具公敎人員薪津調整辦法如後，請轉陳國防最高委員會從速核定飭令施行。</p>
<p>辦法：（一）羅水增）加倍數應至少按戰前一干倍計算。</p>
<p>「說明」：現在男女工人每月工資，均在戰前三千倍至一萬倍以上，公敎人員薪水，至少按工人最低工資三千倍三分之一（即一千倍）計算，稍示公允。</p>
<p>（二）每月生活補助費，至少按二十萬元發給。</p>
<p>「說明」：查生活補助費，原係補助衣食住行之用，現在米糧燃料布疋房租，較戰前價格，漲至五千倍至一萬倍以上，三五口之家，按目前物價情形，每月僅就最普通之喫飯住房而言，至少亦需廿萬元。</p>
<p>（三）發給實物，應妥籌辦法，務使公敎人員，確得實惠。</p>
<p>「說明」戰時發給實物，確有支持長期抗戰效力，只以徵收運轉分配種種手續，需時需人需錢之處過多，不惟公私俱不經濟，且易於發生流弊，似與政府發給食物之原意不甚相符，政府如再發給實物，應根據過去得失，妥籌適當辦法，務使公敎人員，確得實惠，在適當辦法未確定以前，應每月至少發給廿萬元作為自行購備米糧燃料之用。</p>
<p>（四）以上第一第二兩項辦法，應自卅五年三月份起實行。　「說明」：本年三月份公教人員調整待遇辦法，反比二月份低降，中央社曾根據事實，精確分析，刋登全國各報，公敎人員深表同情，况自三月份以後，物價逐日大漲，公敎人員入不敷出，日甚一日，是以本建議案，應請自三月份起實施，以副輿望。</p>

<h3>國防部內設兩重要機構　戰略委會直隸元首　何應欽願為老將領樹楷模</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕還都後中樞第二次紀念週，十三日晨九時在國府大禮堂舉行，由蔣主席主持，何總司令應欽報吿：（一）陸軍總部辦理受降遣俘等十二項任務實施情形，（二）軍事機構調整經過，（三）南京房屋分配實情。何氏首述陸總部主持各戰區受降·遣俘·編遣僞軍·救濟難民·恢復交通·處理收復區黨政事項之經過。繼稱；國防部成立後，依照新建制，即將設置參謀本部及戰略顧問委員會，此種制度乃在促使軍事機構簡化·效率化，將來之國防軍，應選拔優秀靑年，充實各級幹部，俾朝氣充沛，效率宏偉。凡年屆六十二歲之一級上將，年屆六十歲之二級上將及年屆五十六歲之中將，均應依法退伍者，未屆退伍年齡，學術兼備之老成碩果，均可任戰略顧問委員會委員，該會爲國防部機構之一，直隸統帥三軍之元首，平時硏究國防大計，戰時出任指揮官，何氏自願率先奉行，爲老將領樹一楷模，爲國防軍放一異彩先路。最後何氏報吿南京房屋分配情形，略謂：南京淪陷後，房屋被毀者計四千八百幢，增加者祇一百七十幢，房荒之主因在此，勝利後陸軍總部曾接收房屋八幢，現均已分配各中央機關，何氏報吿畢，旋宣吿禮成。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕何總司令應欽在中樞紀念週報吿國防部新制度時，曾微露倦勤之意，何謂。「：渠於本年二月四月，曾兩度向蔣主席懇切表示，一俟國防部成立，本人甚願退處戰略顧問委員會委員之一之身份，爲未來之超然國防軍效勞」。聞國防部參謀總長一職，人選尙未定，因何氏已公開表示不就此職，而軍界有資格充任此職者，均在謙讓中，但軍界人士咸信，週內當可決定。至報載國防部長將由文人充任一說，則絕對不確，現有關之軍事機構整編事宜之準備工作，已大致就緒，整委會決於十六日起在陸總部開始辦公，陸總部之幹部工作人員，除一部已奉令調渝外，餘均留整委會工作，祗少數人員須編遣轉業。自何應欽上將表示願退爲戰略顧問委員會委員，爲國防軍樹立楷模一訊透露後，各地未届退伍年齡之將官，志願解脫軍職，以便應召加入戰略顧委會效力者，預計已有十餘人。聞現任武漢行營主任之程潛上將亦在內。衆信，一旦團結成功，統一完成，中國國防軍之陣容，將彌見堅强。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十三日電〕何總司令應欽今夜招待外籍新聞記者稱，彼將於六月一日或六月一日以前辭職，今後彼將從事「較輕鬆之工作」，出任戰略諮詢委員會委員，其餘各委員爲戰區司令長官及其他尙未達退休年齡之高級將領，如彼之階級，退休年齡爲六十二歲，委員會係一小規模之團體，或將包羅北平行營主任李宗仁，第二戰區司令閻錫山及漢口行營主任程潛，閻氏如果出任委員，亦不必放棄晋省主席之職。</p>
<h3>何總司令報告　執行任務情形</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕何兼總司令應欽，十三日在國府紀念週席上報吿，大要如下：</p>
<p>第一，日本投降後中國陸軍總司令執行任務之情形三十四年八月十八日，奉到最高統帥命令，規定中國陸軍總司令之任務共十二條，茲將各項任務之執行情形分別報吿如下：</p>
<p>（一）「承委員長之命，處理中國戰區內之全部敵軍投降事宜」查中國戰區（柬北在外）包括台灣，澎湖及越南北部，敵軍共三十三個步兵師團，一個戰車師國，兩個飛行師團，四十個獨立旅團，一個獨立騎兵旅團，十九個獨立守備隊（等於獨立旅），六個海軍特別根據地隊，總數的一百三十萬人，早已全部繳械完畢。</p>
<p>（二）指導各戰區，各方面軍分之實施事宜」因中國戰區敵人分布區域甚廣，交通困難，爲使敵軍迅速解除武裝，並容易集中管理這送起見，共分爲十六個受降區，指派十六個受降主官，規定一切受降程序。關於繳械遺俘以及一切軍事接收，尙能步調整齊，順利完成其任務。</p>
<p>（三）「秉承本委員長之意旨，對中國戰區內之敵軍最高指揮官發布一切命令」本人於受命後，即遵照實施，在卅四年九月八日以前，即敵軍總司令岡村寗次大將尙未簽降以前，本人以備忘錄方式通知岡村，規定一切手續，使其對於投降事宜先作各種準備，及九月九日，岡村簽降後，本部即以軍字第一號命令下達於岡村，規定自是日上午九時起，本人對岡村完全改用命令，訓令，所有九日上午九時以前之備忘錄，一律視同命令。所有中國本部</p>
<p>（東三省在外）台灣，澎湖及越南北部之日本陸海空軍，完全接受本人之節制指揮，不受日本政府之任何牽制，即日本岡村之「支那派遣軍總司令官」名義取消，使其仍留南京，專任傳達一及執行本人之命令。</p>
<p>（四）一秉承本委員長之指示與中國戰區美軍人密切合作，辦理美軍佔領區，盟軍聯合個別領區敵軍投降後之處置」關於與美軍合作，其第一工作為空運部隊至京，滬，平，津，船運部隊至台灣。其次為美軍水陸兩棲部隊在青島，天津，秦皇島登陸，協助國軍受降遣俘。再其次為遣僑，在中國戰區內（東三省在外）之日俘及日僑，共二〇三萬九九七四人，分十二個港口遣回日本。截至本年五月五日止，已遣回日本者，爲一六三萬一四三六人，尙餘四十萬另八五三八人，正在加緊遣送中，預計六月三十日以前，必可完全遣回日本。　。收復區內難民救濟，交通通信運輸之恢復事宜」，關於難民救濟，係由救濟總署辦理，本人無權指揮。關於交通通信運蝓少恢復，在隴海綫以南，凡須加以軍事助力。始能恢復者，均經辦理完畢，並均已暢通，惟隴海東一段（即徐州海州段）於恢復後，又被共軍截斷，刻尙未通。至於華北及東北方面，凡國軍到達之地，均已恢復，雖被共軍擾亂破壞，時通時阻，但國軍範圍內之交通，終能維持。</p>
<p>（六）指導各戰區，各方面軍分區，分期辦理接收僞軍投誠，編遣及剿辦不聽命令之僞軍事宜，在受降之際，僞軍總數爲六十八萬三千餘人，均向政府投誠，截至現在止，業已解散四十三萬二千餘人，除僞淮海省長郝逆鵬舉投誠後，因不肯解散其僞軍叛變投共外，其餘均無不聽命令者。（七）負責迅速處置南京僞組織政府，恢復南京及其附近之秩序，敬待國民政府還都，本人於去年九月九日在南京受降時，南京僅運到新六軍之五個連，當時城區敵軍的七萬，城內僞軍一萬餘，城外十公里即爲匪徒出沒之區，本人當時一面趕運軍隊，一面處置敵僞軍，一面肅淸偽組織殘餘勢力，一面驅逐土匪，令派大批日俘參加市區淸潔及築路等工作。在五月五日政府還都時，此項任務業已完全達成，現在首都治安十分鞏固，本人可負責說，今後自都附近絕無不安之顧慮。</p>
<p>（八）「在辦理接受敵軍投降期問，秉承本委員長之指示，調動部隊，佔領中國戰區內各軍事·政治。經濟。交通要點及要港，構成收繳敵軍武器之有利態勢」，目受降以來，廣州·長沙·武漢。南昌·九江·安慶·南京·上海·杭州·徐州·鄭州·洛陽·靑島·濟南·北平·保定。石家莊·天津·山海關·歸綏·包頭·大同·太原·均經迅速佔領，惟古北口·張家口·飛德·赤峯。多倫，因遭遇特殊障碍，未能到達。</p>
<p>（九）「對於非經政府指定之受降部隊，如有擅自接受敵軍投降，企圖擾亂我受降計劃者，得呈請本委員長懲罰之」，自受降迄今，共軍在華北各處雖曾屢次不奉命令，企圖接受敵軍數部份之投降，但均未辦到，故本人亦未呈請委員長採取處置。</p>
<p>（十）「敵軍應府委員長所指定之部隊投降，如不邀我軍命令實施者，得由陸軍總司令下令，以武力制裁之，並對不遵命令之敵部隊長或敵軍最高指揮官，予以直接處置」，爺賴委員長德威，全部日軍在投降期間均確遵本人命令，迄未發生遵犯命令之事實</p>
<p>（十一）「指導盬督並得處理收復區內一切黨政事務」根據此項任務，陸軍總部在芷江時，曾設立收復區黨政接收計劃委會，由總部與政院派員合休閒鞋組成，其辦事方法即向敵僞方面搜集各種冊籍，加以整　理分析，再依性質，命令岡村寗次及各地日軍司令，指定某項事業應保持原狀，於某日交與我政府革院部所派接收人員，惟此種辦法後有命令變更，未能實行，故陸總部到京後，僅係依各接收人員所持各該主管據關令其接收何種事業之命令，下令岡村寗次，遵照移交。</p>
<p>（十二）「指揮各戰區所有向收復區挺進及原在收復區各部隊，但各戰區在後方留防部隊，仍歸各戰區秉承本會（軍委會）之指示指揮之」。本人恪遵辦理，但除因事實需要，復奉委員長命令，將全國陸軍除川康騐所駐者外，均歸本人指揮，後勤總司令部及海軍艦隊，亦暫歸本人指揮，以迄於今。陸軍總部原爲戰時野戰軍最高指揮機關，現在國府業已還都，陸軍總司令部已無存在必要，故本人業已呈請撤消陸軍總部。第二，「中央軍事機構之改組」，本人過去任軍政部長十四年半，參謀總長八年，兼陸軍總司令一年半，深感我中央軍事機構過於龐大複雜，現在抗戰結束，我最高統帥決心建立最進步之軍事制度，取消軍委會，改組國防部，於國防部之下，設參謀本部，一方面使今後之中央軍事機構簡單化，效率化，另一面將國防部歸入行政院，使國防部長成爲內閣之一員。同時，於元首之統帥權則直接透過參謀總長，而對全國陸海空軍發號司令，此種制度十分合理，凡我軍人均竭誠擁護，而參謀本部之要職，並應多用靑年軍官。對於若干老將官之安置，一級上將六十二歲應退役，二級上將六十歲應退役，中將五十六歲應退役，其未滿現役年齡，而曾任重要軍職，學識優良，勛望卓著者，無論陸海空軍將領，均可選任爲戰略顧問委會委員，此委員會直隸元首，平時研究國防及戰略有關之各種問題，戰時則出任高級指揮官。</p>
<p>第三，「關於南京房屋問題」（略）。</p>

<p>嘉興四鄕蠶事，已近大眠，因天時關係，蠶身發育不佳，致蠶汎减色，預料蠶收，定稱中稔，各繭商正在準備收繭，並有數兩廠，經敵僞破壞，一時修復不易，又有各廠因地處僻壞，近又匪警頻聞，故躊躇者亦有多處，刻正向當局請求派隊屆時防衛，以維繭市。至鮮繭價格，業經浙省蠶絲業協會決定，每祖鮮繭不得低於十萬元，本邑繭業公會，亦將於日內召集會議，討論　一切。春繭收價核定公布浙省各縣木年因春蠶飼育踴躍，浙東新嵊等縣，日內新繭即可登塲，收繭貸款業由中蠶公司決定配給一百億元，皖南以產量有限，劃歸浙區辦理，爲急於貸放計，經商准浙中國銀行撥付二十億，十日首先貸出諸曁，一新昌，嵊縣等地五億元，餘數正一在續貸中，至春繭標準價格，業一由省府核定公布，以繅折計算，每百市斤自九萬五千元起，至十二萬元正，其中心價格爲十萬元市府禁止舞廳營業杭市府茲擬定自五月底止，禁止各跳舞廳營業，聞敎育當局，亦將禁止學生，參加跳舞，以免荒廢學業。英國各自治領總理於上月下旬在倫敦舉行帝國會議，討論太平洋的防禦問題，在原則上早已決定召開太平洋各國會議，在太平洋南部及西南部建立一個防禦機構，以抵禦可能的侵略。惟因加拿大總理金氏姍姍來遲，帝國會議只得暫時休會，等待金氏抵英之後重行開會，澈底解決這個問題，並將派遣澳洲總埋齊夫萊氏赴華府，會商美國在太平洋設置防禦基地問題。此在美國方面，　於戰後太平洋形勢的外弛內强，對於在太平洋設置防禦基地問題，尤爲注意。陸軍參謀總長艾森豪威爾元帥且不辭僕僕風塵，遠渡重洋，親自到太平洋方面視察，並乘機訪問我國最高領袖蔣主席。及在遠東視察的英國太平洋艦隊司令福拉塞上將，共商太平洋設防的大計。即此更足見這個問題的重要性，而我國尤其有切身關係，自不能等閑視之。廣東省參議會最近開會，曾通過一項決議，要求中央政府向英國交涉收回香港，內稱「僉以香港九龍爲粵省瀕海要地，對於政治經濟國防，關係重大，實應重隸中國版圖，常經決定，電請中央迅向英國政府交涉收回，以維領土主權，而鞏固國防。』因此，香港問題在太平洋設防聲中，又復爲國人所注意的問題了。</p>
<p>香港是我國領土，於一八四二年雅片戰爭之後，割讓與英，迄今已百餘年，但是我國同胞仍佔香港居民百分之八十。故羅邱蔣三巨瑚在開羅會晤時，共商遠東百年大計，在原則上一致同意將香港歸還中國，羅斯福總統返美後報吿開羅會議的經過也說：『關於開羅會議，曾討論及遠東的百年大計，遠東不久即重行建立，其原則有三：（一）將財產返還原主；（二）承認遠東各國人民有設立自治政府之權，不加干涉；（三）永久消滅日木帝國是維持太平洋以及世界和平之先決條件。』由此可知，在美國偉大的政治外交家的心目中，香港理應歸還中國，絕無問題的。及大戰結束，我國政府本應向英交涉收回，無如東北風雲變色，共產黨企圖覇佔東北，蘇聯軍隊撤退一再延期，使東北九省又成爲錯綜複雜的外交　渦，因此對蘇外交，不能不認爲當務之急，無暇兼顧其他，便把香港問題懸擱起來。不過我們民衆對於這個問題依舊非常關切，尤其注意英國方面對於此一問題的動態。英國太平洋艦隊司令福拉塞上將的來華訪問，及其赴日與盟軍最高統帥麥克阿瑟元帥會晤，更是我們視綫集中的焦點。福拉塞上將在上海時曾向報界表示香港仍將爲英國海軍基地，已引起我國輿論界的不滿；，迨行抵東京，又向法國新聞社記者自稱，「中國寗顧英軍留駐谷港」，本報特派員深恐此言或係訛傳，特別前往訪問，詎知福拉塞竟說：「中國局勢極爲混沌，無論如何，彼等仍係野蠻人」（見五月十二日本報第一版）。身爲海軍司令長官，出言如此失檢，殊堪扼腕，吾人不能不引爲遺憾。吾人爲維護兩國邦交計，對於福拉塞語無倫次，不能不加駁斥。戰後的英國政治，雖已由工黨繼起執政，以社會主義相號召，但是在外交上，仍不脫保守黨時代的作風，到處暴露出帝國主義者的猙獰而目。甚至不顧戰時所提供的諾言及其所標榜的作戰目標，而遂行其一己之私。羅邱宣言之八點。早就拋到九霄雲外去了。例如英國對於香港九龍問題，不僅沒有歸還中國之意向，而且懷有極大的野心，曾企圖在九龍屛山建築大規模的飛機塲，以鞏固香港在北太平洋的地位，後經我國民衆一再抗議，始放棄此項計劃。這種倒行逆施的措置，徒見其心勞日拙。英國須知收回香港，是中國人民一致的「民族願望」，誰也不能拂逆的。</p>
<p>五人論及香港問題，一九四一年十二月廿五日香港陷落的一幕，依稀還在我們眼前，歷歷如繪。香港戰事未及兩足期而英軍無法抵抗，束手投降，官兵被俘者一萬一千人，在英國近代史上是最不光榮的一頁。據軍事專家硏究英軍不能久守香港的原因，最主要的，是由於英軍未能堅守九龍，待至中國軍隊開到，共同拱衛香港。這一段歷史的回憶，大有助於英國了解香港的地位。英國對於遠在千萬里以外的香港，鞭長莫及，一旦有事，無論如何，是無法保全的。戰前是如此，今後亦復如此。何况戰後的太平洋形勢，早已發生絕大的變化，不論從任何一隻角度去觀察，英國實無保持香港作爲某一國的海軍基地的必要。</p>
<p>英國將香港歸還中國，在理論上是應有之舉。縱在感情上，英人對於放棄香港，固不得不認爲大英帝國日趨式微的象徵，或不免要引起死硬派的感慨唏噓，不勝迷戀，但是執政者應該放大眼光，正視現實，洞察國內外情勢。最近英相艾德禮一面允許印度獨立，另一面又宣佈英軍自埃及撤退，英國工黨政府確有新的趨向，博得全世界的好評，吾人深望英國當局對於香港問題，也能採取開明的措置。</p>

<h3>東京審日戰犯　清妄圖限制法庭權力　檢察長嚴詞駁斥　孫立人將軍京出庭旁聽</h3>
<p>〔本報東京十三日電〕消息靈通方面人士稱：日本戰犯辯護律師團要求麥克阿瑟在麥帥總部之下，設立辯護組，有如麥帥總部下之檢察組。麥帥於聽取此項要求後，已予以拒絕。</p>
<p>〔本報東京十三日電〕國際軍事法庭今日繼續審判工作。反對國際聯盟並簽訂日蘇中立條約之松岡洋右，亦在受審之列，但因病未能出席。新一軍長孫立人將軍道經東京，今晨亦出庭旁聽。大多數新聞記者對於此一緬甸戰役之英雄，均甚熟悉。孫將軍坐於榮譽席上，雙目不斷注視二十六個日本被吿。日本首席辯護律師淸瀨，向法官九人爭辯達兩小時。淸瀨指出在「滿洲事件「之後，蘇聯政府即承認「滿洲國」，因蘇方將中東鐵路出售與「滿洲國政府」，是故滿洲方面若十問題必須不在審判施圍之內。蘇聯助理檢察官即將一字條交與首席檢察官季楠。李楠富即起立，阻止淸瀨之辯論，並向首席法官魏勃云：「法庭不容淸瀨以此種方式進行辯論」。魏勃即云：「繼續講下去」。季楠稱：「日本辯謹律師必須列舉事實」。魏勃繼即命令日本辯護律師根據事實辯護。淸瀨云：「余已明白」，但繼續提出有關蘇聯之若千問題。渠稱：日蘇同有中立關係，故無作戰之必要。季楠復起立，要求魏勃停止此種辯論，因其已越出事實範圍。其後淸瀨即停止無謂之辯論，法庭休息十五分鐘。法庭再開時，季楠即起立致辭，反對被吿限制法庭權力之任何企圖，不得曲解波茨坦宣言之眞義。渠堅主一切戰犯必須予以正義之裁判，包括虐待盟國戰俘之日人在內。彼不承認日本之投降係有任何條件者。至四時五十分，暫吿停止辯論，由審判長宣示明晨九時半繼續辯論。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京十三日專電〕今日東條之辯護律師淸瀨一郞，代表日全體辯護律師呈送申請書，對國際軍事法庭之本晨所規定之戰罪範圍事項及其權限問題，發出詰難。清　一郎堅謂：日侵佔東北，不屬太平洋戰爭範圍內，或「大柬亞戰爭」範圍內。彼指出「滿洲事件」，造成「滿洲國」，乃蘇聯所默認者，東條之律師直接向蘇法官稱：蘇俄出賣中東鐵路與「滿洲國」，即蘇承認滿洲僞國之存在，淸瀨一郞指稱：一九三八年張鼓峯事件，一九三九年諾蒙亨事件，均已由蘇日政府簽訂之協定，予以解決，季楠中止其辯論，反對「此種辯論方式」。庭長魏勃　吿淸瀨，勿作違反事實之論調，淸瀨續指稱：由於違協定，已解決張鼓峯及諾蒙亨兩事件，故應自訴狀中，撤銷以兩事件爲根據之第五十一及第五十二條控訴。季楠扳即起立並宣稱：蘇檢察官「否認被告律師關於張或峯事件之陳述爲事實」，淸瀨繼擴續要求來日提出證據，以證明其言論。</p>
<h3>清瀨狺狡辯　竟曲解波茨坦宣言</h3>
<p>〔聯台社東京十三日電〕遠東國際軍事法庭今日開庭，白　蒼蒼之東條辯護人清瀨一郎，代表日本被吿二十八名，高聲指責聯合國控訴日本前任各領袖違反和平違反人道等罪，實係「超越國際公法範圍</p>
<h3>一派狂言冀圖粉飾</h3>
<p>清瀨對法庭之糧限開始質難時宣鞶：「波茨坦宣言不僅約東日本，同時亦約束各聯合國」，依照波茨坦協定，聯合國方面曾允許僅檢舉違反旣成法律及戰爭慣例之戰爭犯，並未包括控訴狀中所列舉之新項目，如追究被吿對於煽動戰爭及虐待聯合國人民之責任之類。「日本之投降與德國之投降大不相同，德國抵抗到底，終於崩潰，此乃無條件投降」。波茨坦宣言規定日本停戰各條件，「此乃一種提議」，惟其如此，故被接受，亦惟其如此，聯合各國務必遵守。聯合國在紐倫堡法庭，儘可懲處各戰爭犯，而不加審判，因德國乃無條件投降也。聯合國對日本各被吿之控訴狀實已超出現行國際法，全世界任何國際法典之中，並無提及策劃戰爭爲戰爭罪者，淸瀨並引證英國戰爭法典之數節，證明戰爭罪特別規定爲四種，即非戰鬥人員違反軍事權利，擄掠，間諜活動及陰謀破壞。並稱：截至一九四五年七月爲止，各種現行行法律，無論戰爭性質如何，策劃，發動及遂行戰爭均不能認爲違一反羽平非淸瀨稱：波茨坦宣言雖有　以嚴法之規定，惟「吾等日本人從未料及該項宣言將推廣及於違反和平罪並對重要政治家外交家及日本其他要人提出控訴」。日本接受波茨坦宣言時，僅知戰爭犯之懲處應以常時存在之國際公法爲根據云。</p>
<p>因語言之隔閡，審判進行甚爲遲緩。淸瀨本通英語，而以日語發言，但不時時糾正譯員之誤，俾使意義正確。</p>
<p>淸瀨旋述及日蘇兩國曾於一九三八年爲解決張鼓峯之不宣而戰，簽訂協定解決邊境糾紛。蘇聯法官柴利耶諾諾夫表示反對，審判長魏勃乃令將淸瀨之言論自紀錄中刪去。淸瀨亦要求將被控對泰國所犯各項罪狀刪去，因「泰國並非聯合國，過去如此，現在亦然」，故法庭並無權限，越爼代庖。並稱：關於泰國之各項控訴，被檢舉之人，在案發當時，身在東京而不在泰國，此事誠足驚奇云。</p>
<h3>法庭之週圍鐵絲綱重重</h3>
<p>日戰犯廿八個被吿，今日僅到廿六人，缺席之二人，一爲大川周明，曾在二次法庭中行動失常，正在實施精神檢騐，另一人爲前外相松岡洋右，亦在實施醫學檢騐。審判廳所在之陸軍省大厦周圍今日已裝有一圈高高鐵絲網，此乃一種新的安全措置，憲兵繼續在各出入口守衛，並搜檢聯合國及日本一切旁聽人員。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京十三日〕遠東國際軍事法庭今日開庭時，法官九人中七人均戴黑色眼鏡，以避免便利攝影所裝之强烈燈光，其不戴眼鏡者僅美國麻州高等法院審判長希岑斯及蘇聯法官柴里諾夫。被吿方面亦受燈光刺激影響，左藤戴黑色眼鏡，阪垣則闢目如睡，被吿席中僅南次郎戴有譯意風。</p>
<h3>審判工對被告律師　兩次提出警告　勸其勿用煽動言論</h3>
<p>今日國際法庭聽取日本辯護律師對於管轄權限之爭，判長魏勃曾對被吿律師兩次予以忠吿，先批評其用粉飾之辭藻，繼復警吿其勿用煽動之言論，以免法庭懷有成見，李楠曾請庭上准其節讀一九四二年羅斯福總總統之廣播演說，內中證明聯合國早欲令軸心國領袖及其羽黨以煽動戰爭罪受法律制裁。季楠於商准法官後，曾徵引羅斯福，史達林，邱吉爾及蔣主席之言，並向庭上聲明可信任其不越出合禮範圍？英國副檢察官卡爾亦封　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　絕倫。</p>
<h3>伊朗亞省代表　與政府重開談判　和平解決希望雖漸增政府軍仍源源開邊境</h3>
<p>〔合衆社德黑爾十二日電〕據接近伊首相方面人士今夕稱：亞塞爾拜然民主代表團與伊首相沙丹納間之談判，經若干日之僵持後，今日已吿恢復。據謂；此次重開談判，係應亞省代表團團長畢希伐里之請求，談判時，畢氏已將原使談判決裂之對案撤回，政界人士今晚認爲和平解決現已較有希望，然星期一倫敦各晨報載引大不列士電台廣播，謂亞省已「向伊朗中央政府宣戰」廣播內並稱：「我方軍隊刻正開向德黑蘭」，每日簡報强調謂；某方面初曾傳出宣戰消息，但旋又加以否認。上星期日晚上，合衆社自德黑蘭發出電訊，曾報吿談判重開之事，並未提及開戰消息。〔聯合社德黑蘭十二日電〕可靠伊朗政府官員今日表示：大不列士電台雖宣布，亞塞爾拜然人民雖「準備一戰」，但伊朗內戰一時不致發生，或竟得挽救，亦未可知。亞省總理畢希伐利昨日原已至德黑蘭飛機塲準備回大不列士，嗣因天氣不佳，未能成行，旋往晤中央政府總理沙丹納，表示願意依據政府提案重開談判。政府提案規定亞省重歸中央政府管轄，惟保留若干自治權。畢希　利聞已準備將所提對案中某某數點撤消，以利進行，而將早日成立協定。</p>
<p>德黑蘭電台廣播否認某通訊社所傳沙丹納不惜用武力解決亞省問題之說，惟日來伊朗形勢緊張，援軍源源開往寇特斯坦邊境，係屬實情。陸軍參某軍官昨亦承認有大批軍火及若干士兵器，運往接濟忠於中央政府之柴爾法加利及阿夫沙部落云。</p>

<h3>對英美實施　經濟抵制</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社耶路撒冷十二日電〕阿拉伯高級委會秘書長赫西尼頃致電叙利亞與黎巴嫩兩國總理，要求對英美實行經濟抵制，並謂「在阿拉伯會議（十八日在大馬色附近舉行）解決問題之前，請勿以經濟利益畀予英美。</p>
<h3>猶太秘密黨　警告英國</h3>
<p>〔路邊社耶路撤冷〕十三日電〕猶太抵抗運動之地下電台「伊斯萊爾呼聲」，前夜發表廣播稱，即使英美巴勒斯坦調查報吿書中之建議，並不付諸實行，巴勒斯坦亦將被迫抵抗「英國在巴勒斯坦設置軍事根據地」。猶太抵抗運動決將阻撓英國欲使巴勒斯坦成爲其軍營之努力。</p>
<h3>日人民衝入皇宮事　影響波及全國　警察當局發出警告　示威者將接踵而至</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十三日電〕日本至尊之皇宮禁地，昨被一羣要求糧食及政治領導權之人民衝入，在日本尙爲史無前例。（消息見昨日本報）在日本全部糧食危機及政治不寗之歷史中，迄無任何羣衆膽敢闖入皇宮禁地，至多不過經由官廳上書請願而已。皇宮禁地被闖入最魯莽之一次，發生於一九四五年八月十五日夜，當時有頑固軍閥多人，突破大門，衝至宮內省，搜尋日皇投降詔書之灌音片，欲將其取去。昨日之事影響已波及全國，但日人並不認爲此舉對皇室有何失敬之處，倘在數月以前，則其反響定必强烈。此種因素似爲日皇與人民新關係之象徵。據聞內務省警察當局已發出警吿，謂日本本全國人民對於當前政治危機遲不解決，益增不安，預料多數示成者將接踵而來云。</p>

<h3>外長會議續開　力謀獲協議　貝文昨自倫敦返巴黎　魯爾區問可能妥協</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十三日電〕四國外長會議停止一天後，今日續開，力圖解決尙未獲協議各點，而法方所提將魯爾兵工廠區劃離德國之要求，似有妥洽可能。法方消息靈通人士稱：英方近曾建議，在魯爾區採取聯合制度，甚至包括萊茵區一部份在內，此種辦法，可能商獲　妥洽。此外，對義和的等重要問題，似亦可妥洽解決，僅特里埃斯特問題除外。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十三日電」英外相貝文上週杪回英向首相艾德禮有所報吿後，已於今日下午七時卅分（上海時間）飛抵此間，以便進行四國外長會議。貝文離倫敦時，並未發表談話。衆信貝文之突然回英，常係蘇聯外長莫洛托夫在星期五夜與星期六會議中已允改變對義和的之態度，故需與英相面商英國對此問題可能改變立塲一事。倫敦觀察家現相信巴黎會議成敗或能於本週初即爲決定。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯夫婦　賞游巴黎街景</h3>

<h3>莫一遜抵美協商　加緊反饉鬬爭　胡佛同日抵華府將謁總統告報　美或將恢復糧食記梧制</h3>
<p>〔聯合十社華盛頓十三日電〕英樞密大臣莫理遜，昨自倫敦飛抵此間，下機後向記者發表談話稱，唯有採取各項有力措置，始足以挽救饑荒。並謂，本人此來，係與杜魯門總統協商，如何可使五口人奮戰以赴之目標，得免於被世界普遍性饑饉所拖累而受影響。吾人在擊潰納粹德國及日本之後，對於足以左右世界命運之反饑饉鬥爭，余不信其不能獲勝。但此際此種戰鬥於吾人不利，實屬無可諱言。饑饉可以殺害無數平民，傳佈法西斯毒菌，較希特勒與墨索里尼所能爲者尤爲迅速。莫氏復謂，印度問題當然在渠討論之範圍以內。此外，世界報倫敦訪員則自某高級當局探悉，莫理遜將要求杜魯門總統在美國實施肉類與脂肪限制消費辦法。</p>

<h3>宋院長正式宣布　吳國楨任滬市長　副市長何德奎有繼任市府秘書長說　財政警察敎育衛生四局長提辭呈</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十三日電一行政院長宋子文，今晚正式宣布，前宣傳部長吳國楨，已被任命爲上海新市長。宋氏將於明日舉行招待記者會，宣佈各項新任命。</p>
<p>吳氏略歷</p>
<p>吳國楨氏在民國紀元前九年十月生於湖北建始小鎮三里　，民國十年畢業於北京淸華學校，十二年畢業於美國格林內爾大學，得學士學位，十三年得美國潑林斯頓大學碩士學位，十五年又得該大學政治系哲學博士學位。</p>
<p>民國十六年任國民政府外交部秘書，江蘇交涉公署交際科科長，外交部第一司副司長，條約委員會委員等職。十七年曾任湖北菸酒事務局局長。十八年曾任武漢特別市政府簡任參事，漢口特別市政府土地局長及財政局長。不久吳氏升任漢口市市長，此時吳氏祇三十餘歲，是中國歷史上最年輕的一位市長。吳氏除具有精明幹練的辦事能力外，並操着一口流利的英語。蔣夫人曾經這樣讚美過吳氏：「在中國我沒有看到過一個留學生能說得這樣好的英語的」！</p>
<p>吳氏自武漢撤退到重慶以後，不久又榮任陪都的市長。廿八年春間吳氏呈奉蔣主席的批准，組織特別警衛團及民衆自衛隊。其後吳氏調任外交部次長，卅四年升任宣傳部長，一直担任到現在。吳夫人爲前漢陽兵工廠廠長黃公偉女公子黃瑪麗女士。</p>
<h3>各局長提辭呈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據確息：本市市長錢大　呈請辭職照准，將另任他職，由中宣部部長吳國楨繼任後，市府副市畏制度將予廢止。沈士華將辭秘書長職，由副市長何德奎繼任。</p>
<p>各局局長已呈請辭職者，計財政局局長浦拯東，警察局局長宣鐵吾，衛生局局長兪松筠，敎育局局長顧毓琇及地政局局長陳石泉。又市府總務處處長。人事處處長。交際科科長以及有關各室主任等，亦將提辭呈。</p>
<p>本市各界最爲關懷之警察局長人選，據傳迄目前止，以國民政府文官處總務局局長陳希曾呼聲爲最高。又傳中央警官學校敎務長李士珍或現警局副局長兪叔平亦有繼任可能。兪氏係維也納警官大學畢業，又入維也納大學專攻法律，得博士學位，返國後歷一任大學敎授曁中央黨部考試院等一要職，爲中國有數警察專家。</p>
<h3>浦局長談稅收問題　房捐率不慶增加　可由房東房客自行規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市財政局局長浦拯東，辭意堅決，已向錢市長提出呈辭，並請轉行政院核准，據浦局長昨日吿記者謂，財局接收之初，稅收僅六千萬餘元，後逐月增加，上月份已達三十億元，尙有中央取之地方之其他稅收約十三億元，本月份總數當可超出四十五億元。局方本「杜（杜絕貪汚，剔除中飽」以人民付稅，一分一毫歸入國庫之宗旨，嚴密管理全局人事，相信本局仝人，均廉潔自持。至外界查稅等人員，是否有漏弊情事，則不得而知。但財局收支有精密繁複之手續，全部現款收人，不經局中人員經手，均有專門機構辦理，直接繳納市銀行。支出手續尤爲精確，領款單必須經市長。會計長·審計處。財局等各當局藍印後，方可交款。對於本市房捐徵收辦法，浦局長認爲有改良之必要。蓋戰前工部局收入，房捐佔全部百分之六十，而止前大部收稅取之娛樂，筵席等捐，以不甚合理，對市府稅收，每一市民均應共同負責；故主張以後房捐不必規定加倍數目，儘可由房東房客，自行規定。市府房捐率亦不應增加，仍按百分之十四徵收，如此則不但可使市府收入增高，且可避免二房東從中勒索金條，大房東亦可不因房屋主權喪失而不願興建新屋。市府財政若能依此辦法實行，則收入必將有多無缺。</p>
<h3>衛生局自製之藥品　效力比DDT強　本市防疫工作積極</h3>

<p>資方同業公會昨日於報端刋佈啓事，詳述歷來增加工資之記錄。並稱此次職工越規行動，各號損失重大，不得已被迫停業，籲請各界主持公道。</p>
<p>職工方面則稱：勞資談判迄今，數月於茲，資方一味拖延，工人迫於生計忍無可忍，遂有一部份工友因激於義憤，有此越規行動，以後當設法制止。然總望問題早日解決，工人實不能長此延待云。</p>
<p>又資方負責人談；該業工資平均比較其他各業爲優，而勞工猶時以武力要挾，行兇毀物，資方被迫求全，已非一次。四月生活低，而資方求以四千七百元發給。勞方宣傳，故意將各月生活指數報低，無非朦混社會，委過資方。又勞方揚言資方來料工資，竟有取費二十萬元，而成本加襯連工資僅六萬元，此種指摘，絕無僅有。普通來料工資大約十萬</p>

<p>陶逆爲浙江紹興人，今年三十九歲，住膠州路一二五弄五號。靑年時未曾受過中等敎育，自行苦學；抗戰以前，在文化界已有相常地位，當鄒韜奮主編「生活」週刋時，彼主撰「　遠鏡與顯徽鏡」，頗為時人所稱。其後創辦「宇宙風」，「天下事」，「大風」等雜誌，更風行一時，頗爲文化界所推重。抗戰軍興後，即赴香港，經熊式一之帮助，主持復刋事宜。民國三十一年春、竟爾在滬附逆，出任偽中華日報社附設之宣傳刋物「中華周刋」編輯，宣揚「和運」。翌年該刊停刋，因而解職，卒因是而爲日寇所垂靑，被邀參加在東京舉行之「大東亞文學會議」。直至勝利後，由淞滬警備司令部逮捕，經高檢處偵查後，正式提起公訴。</p>

<p>對妻啜咬死還說值得你哭什麽</p>
<p>至於參加「大東亞文學會議」，陶逆供稱：該會共開三次，（民國三十一·三十二·三十三年各開一次），第一次拒絕參加，第二次碍於職務，經與朱委商酌後，始行。共開會三天，討論中日古典文學之譒譯，日方有武者小路實篤。佐藤春夫。谷崎潤一郞等文學家參加。歸國後曾做一報吿交朱雯轉吳紹澍，頗爲吳氏嘉許。曹推事問出席該會之中國代表團有幾人」？答：「四五十八」。問：團長是誰？那些是中心人物」？陶逆　　曰：「如無必要，請允我兔講。因我已被」害，不想去連累別人」。曹推事乃尤其書面遞呈。嗣由馬叔庸律師呈閱證明文件數紙，謂東南區宣傳員高季琳（柯靈），二次爲敵僞拘捕，均經被吿怒救，且被吿曾大險，爲吾地下工作人員印刷抗戰宣傳品云。傳訊畢，被吿接見家屬，其妻哭不成聲，陶逆竟大聲曰：「我値得你哭什麼，我們的國家才値得你哭：」。庭諭改期再訊，被吿還押。　昨晨又審閔行保長朱長生案，控其在敵僞期內，借勢凌人，由朱上林·張福田二證人到庭供證。經曹推事逐一問訊後，亦諭改期再訊。</p>
<p>二起漢奸案件辯論終結候判</p>
<p>昨日下午一一時半，並由蕭庭長變榮暨洪錫恒，馮志棟二推事，審結漢奸罪案二件：（一）常東明，吳馬人，廿七歲，住蘇州太平坊二號，於民卅一年一月，投考僞吳縣區長訓練班，畢業後，歷任僞江陰第一區公所助理，僞吳縣縣政府保甲指導員，僞吳縣光福區，木凟區，滸墅關區等區長，並在僞田賦分征所主任任內，代敵購買軍米六千擔。被吿供稱爲生活所迫，出於不得已，至購買軍米，絕無其事。（二）楊志偉，浦東人，廿歲，住白克路水永業里四十三號，業運輸，曾藉敵勢欺詐良民。被吿猶圖狡賴。二案經辯護律師辯論，庭諭木月十七日下午二時半宣判。</p>

<h3>銀樓幫進胃大健　金價再漲十萬　高峯曾出一八五萬　配價提高為一七六</h3>
<p>赤昨繼續趨俏，人心受種種流言所激動，買氣逾恒，中行配給同業五六一條，被迫將價格提升至一七六萬元，查晨開前塲外預做即吿飛黃騰達，銀樓帮除大同行週日休假外，各小同行及四郊銀樓，爭先抵補隅前缺額，毛盤喊價已激漲至一八〇萬以上，正式開市時在一八〇萬左右，開後曾喊高至一八五萬以上，始見壓力，多頭亦有出售，證券帮獲利了結，逐漸步落，十時左右在一七七萬前後徘徊殊久，形成拉鋸，中行即以一七六萬之價配給業中五六）條，迨配給竣事後，投機復起，曾扳高至一八〇萬以上，無如美鈔並不跟進，引起套賣，一度回跌至一七三萬，午刻仍有買戶活動，利用銀行午餐時間，市價抬高至一八三萬，中行再施壓力，乃退人一八〇萬內，惟最後仍屹立一八〇萬外，結果較前收再漲十萬，飾金掛十九萬二，紋銀一千七，銀元一〇九〇元有賣，暗拆銀根稍鬆，息價自一角六分至二角不等。</p>
<h3>銀行供源旺盛　美鈔欲漲無力　港幣貶值空氣濃</h3>
<p>美鈔有美商銀行逢高脫售，不若黃金之鋒俏，對黃金套頭拔開至七六〇元以上，晨開時在二四五〇元至二五〇〇元，不久即節節步降，進口商雖有結進備用，無奈美銀行供源不斷，終吿不支，退至二三〇〇元以內，午刻金市重振，套頭拔開過甚，引起套買，再回升至二三五〇元光景，午後形勢平穩，在二三〇〇元外徘徊，結果較上週六微升十元，港票晨初受金鈔影響，曾見四四〇元高價，終以港幣貶値消息濃厚，港匯鬆動，復吿挫落，結果回小五元，港匯四二〇元，羅比五二〇元，均有售出，美匯明平　滯。</p>
<h3>大戶一出手　公債便轉風</h3>
<p>公債昨漲後轉呈恍惚，中途環境不利，統丙自七一〇〇元步降至六三五〇元左右，迨多頭斬殺殆盡，業中大戶始來補進，四升至七一五〇元光景，北帶獲利出金換債，局勢改觀，午收結果較前收回升二百五，甲乙丁均平，戊種微升一百元。</p>
<h3>紗市籌碼乾涸　熱門貨紡建未開售</h3>
<p>昨日現紗市况，初開情勢尙平靜，旋聞津帮有競辦細紗消息，更因黃金賡續騰踊，雲時買氣重振，並聞紡建公司適逢開紗之期，計開售各級紗廿六種之多，內以十支及六十八十及一百文爲多，四十二支及卅二支熱門貨隻包未有，以致市上供給籌碼愈形乾涸，是以情况日趨緊俏，結果以四十二支水月及廿支白朮艇兩牌各漲五六萬，其餘各紗扯漲一二萬，布市客帮與門莊對於灰光斜進胃仍濃，價再漲一千餘，其餘各牌榮辱不一，花市紐的美棉報漲二至十七磅音，計近期美金二七，四〇，遠期二七，九五，米特林現貨二八，二〇，本埠現棉交易平常，僅中新第一廠及同業略有進胃，其餘各廠仍存觀望。</p>
<h3>麻類市面平平</h3>
<p>麻煩戰前本以歐洲銷塲爲最巨，自八一三後，外銷受阻，而國內運輸亦不圓滑，故本埠來源因此中斷，勝利以後到貨迄未暢通，至今春稍有來貨，然僅少數，與從前之到銷相比僅十之一二而已，最近雖到源略多，然外銷未見交易。專供內銷，業此者均不感興趣，市面一時難期發展，致價格漲跌不大，近日各麻號售價，白麻每市担六萬五千元，沅江麻六萬五千元，靑麻六萬元云。</p>
<h3>糖市貨缺價升</h3>
<p>昨糖市因現貨軋缺而需要較多，價乃突升，公會劃盤中砂白上午初爲六萬二千元，旋至六萬五千元至五千五百元，下午更升至六萬七千元，前後升六七千元，其他雜路貨因亦隨升，刁靑上午開價甚亂，有數千元進出，正式市價在四萬八千元之譜，下午升至五萬元。比前日升四五千元。</p>
<h3>國產自行車　售十五萬三千</h3>
<p>上海機器廠，經資源委員會接收後，最近造就鐵錨牌二十六吋自行車多輛，試行成績頗爲圓滿，擬即開始總市，定價爲國幣十八萬元，自本月十日起按八五折計算，每輛減售十五萬三千元，接治處爲九江路五〇號上海市銀行大樓三一〇室。</p>
<h3>證券幫出金換股　市況漸由疲轉穩</h3>
<p>華股人心繼續不定，乍進乍退，大勢疲後稍定，小型股則每况愈下，大勢悲慘，中途漲而復跌，永紗自五〇三〇元降至四七五〇元，美亞自四一五〇元退至三八八〇元，景福自三四〇元退至三二五，新光自二九〇元退至二六八元，勤興自二四〇元退至二二五元，午刻均稍扳高，證劵帮補空，出金換股，以至大熱情形漸穩，小股仍感落後，結果較前收永紗美亞微升，其他各股除中紡火柴外均吿下挫，午後隔夜交易僅做永紗美亞，喊價續吿扳高，外股亦初疲後穩，中途多盤，怡紗在一三大關內外，呈拉鋸模樣，結果各股與上週六相彷彿，惟怡紗在午後微漲，美聯等均稍跌。</p>
<h3>絲綢均俏</h3>
<p>昨市一二〇天橋有光人造絲，開盤一百三十九萬元，最小一百三十六萬元，三十八萬元收盤，下午做價一百四十萬元，結果較上週末大起六七萬元，七五金雞半光，貨稀較俏，價亦獨好，廠絲受金價上升影響，各檔均帶起五萬元左右，綢貨市價亦跟進，萬亞被面每百條高七萬元，大誠格子壁縐每碼四千一百三十元，校上週末高三百元强，盛貨價亦喊高千元之譜，</p>
<h3>呢布暢滯不一</h3>
<p>呢羢走銷，近週來連日均滯，客帮雖有小數點綴，皆係零星，本街各帮憾於如此高價，出手困難，兼以西服裁縫帮在罷工中，出路又减少一半，惟黃綠色之卡其布等，刻銷塲頗暢，京杭兩地，均有大量搜羅，每碼由一千五六百元起至三千元止，鑒於貨物流通甚缺，大多數皆在購白坯染色中，如南京帮竟皆以淡黃色防雨布代替之，先後已裝去一萬碼以上矣，</p>
<h3>抽貢綠茶七百箱　上週初次運往印度</h3>
<p>查印度孟買，在戰前對於華茶歷年向有相當出口，而勝利後，因交通關係，迄未裝往，茲悉彼地消息，目前需求抽貢綠茶，本市瑞昌洋行爲供應急需起見，已有七百箱於上週作首批試運，如能無礦，嗣後當有絡繹去化，又聞拈孖治等洋行，亦有活動準備，至於本市茶葉市况，溫州新旗槍，以到數激增，品質低劣，行情底盤已軟化，杭州新龍井，市上傳聞津帮及南京帮，已在產區活躍，故人心帶挺，持者喊價向榮，結果比上週軋升，陳紅綠茶，供求相若，市氣穩定。</p>
<p>囤溪毛茶慘跌　祁門紅茶，早經上市，據聞各銀行以杭徽路時有刧車情事，運送成具戒心，而各茶商又以滬市茶銷疲滯，亦意存觀望，毛茶收購權由每斤八百元跌至二百元，低於農民生產成本，刻採摘時期已過，各茶商正在烘製中。</p>
<p>英國方面觀察　英國新聞處倫敦十三日電，此間「經濟家」載稱：茶季將臨，中國茶商正力謀恢復茶葉出口，該業且已向四行請求鉅額貸款，茶葉出口雖不致恢復戰前每年八千萬至一萬萬磅之數，然有組織之中國出口貿易之重整頗値得注意。荷屬東印度之茶園戰時受損過重，一時尙不能大量供應；日本。台灣，越南。與馬來亞尙無茶市；印度錫蘭英屬東非，於以往五茶季中幾擔負全世界茶噸位，今亦患昔日採摘過甚之影響，並感施肥不足。因而目前亟宜增加受戰爭摧殘之茶源之產量。用</p>
<p>中國政府以爲如能找到市塲，中國仍能出口茶葉約二萬萬磅。最近十年來世界對華茶之需要所以銳减者，因中國茶業在生產方法上較印度。錫蘭·荷屬東印度爲落後，因而中國政府正準備一重要改良計劃，計劃堪稱得時，然恐數年後方能完全生效。</p>
<p>同時，荷屬東印度與其他東方茶葉輸出國或可漸漸恢復證前出口量，由於此種背景，華茶出口運動難免遭遇困難與磨擦。朱來世界茶葉消耗之趨向，目前尙不能估計，若干年中世界茶葉或有供過於求之現象，亦未可知，如一是，國際合作勢必恢復，中國亦將包括在內。一</p>
<h3>英美顏料商　暫停定貨</h3>
<p>戰前在華推銷顏料之美商南星·恒信·吉時，及英商之卜內門洋行等，現均在華復業，銷售現貨，幷接受預訂貨品，據悉各行近半年來接受之訂貨甚多，但現以英美國內各該顏料廠，製造設備，均在復員之始，（各大顏料廠戰時均改製軍用化學品）兼以美國罷工風潮，目前生產有限，現各該行在滬，均接本國行廠電示，　暫停接訂貨，已接受之訂貨，須在本年冬季，始可陸續交完云。</p>
<h3>美總商會舉行　國外貿易週　積極發展國外貿易</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十二日電〕美總商會八日宣佈稱，會方頃已致函全美各地社會團體，邀請被等參加五月十九日至廿五日之國外貿易週，國外貿易週包括廿二日之航海日在內，航海日係爲紀念一九一八年美國第一艘輪船橫波大西洋而設，總商會籲請各方於本年內積極發展國外貿易，杜魯門總統曾謂本年爲「決定性之一年」，總會指陳本年重要計劃之一爲召開一國際性之貿易職業會議，商討組設國際貿易組織問題，此一倡議籌設中之組織將爲促進國際貿易之世界性組織，發展國際貿易之首要工作爲重建平時商船隊並設立國際航空綫，總商會繼稱；國會現正硏究美國與十四個以上國家訂立貿易協定之立法案件，此事即爲美國重視國際貿易之明證。</p>
<h3>台灣歸還中國後　遠東食糖供應轉變　中國消費量將大增</h3>
<p>（路透社倫敦十三日電），柴尼柯夫有限公司著文檢討世界之食糖情形稱，台灣之歸還中國，使遠東之食糖供應狀况全變，由於甘蔗及肥料之缺乏，台灣恢復輸出食糖固尙須若干時日，但在一九三八—三九年一季中，該島即曾生產食糖一百三十五萬六千噸，此項食糖當時幾全部輸往日本，因日本本國之食糖生產每年僅四萬五千噸，而需要竟達一百十四萬九千噸之多，今後日本恐不能恢復戰前每人每年消耗食糖二十四磅之水準，中國對於食糖之使用勢將大增，戰前由於中國人民購買力之低下，每人每年消耗食糖僅四磅，今後即將台灣食糖全部加以吸收之後，其水準依然較歐洲人爲低。</p>
<h3>各方密切注意下　米價昨略停前進　糧商前往產區採購　公會證明即可通行</h3>
<p>昨日米市到銷兩淡，粳秈均小千元，惟南路早薄稻及白元仍無上落，麵粉外埠銷胃轉懈，本街隨之觀望，價形早堅午疲，無所榮辱，豆餅麩皮均少軒輊，黃豆高貨見跌千元，中下平平，菉豆南洋揀高進取，價提高殺次，芝蔴亦然，高俏次平，生仁彷彿，苞米靑島動而不旺，市形堅穩之局，紅糧上升千元，汕市到銷兩平，暫無呼吸，聞巴西洋米亦在接洽中，劃申每石的計三萬元零。昨日本市到米，據米市塲息，共六千餘石，其種類及石數如下白粳三、一二五石，薄稻九一七石，早稻九五〇石，羊秈四〇石，杜秈七一四石，蕪秈三六五石，白元三五石，陰元三〇石。</p>
<p>〔本報訉〕蕪一湖米將有大量到埠，由招商局機帆裝運，聞有一船計裝一千餘包，今日可抵滬。</p>
<h3>公會填發　糧商採辦運輸證</h3>
<p>又訊，糧食部次長龐松舟，上週來滬處理糧政緊急措施，經興有關當局協議糧食調節問題，並以今後糧商赴產米區採購，准自由行動，不受限制，故已督促糧商集團採購，即日開始實行，所有糧商前往產區採購米糧，祗須該業公會證明，即可儘量運輸來滬，本市荳米業公會奉令辦理之糧商採辦運輸證，業於昨日上午九時起，正式開始塡發，原文如下：「茲據本會會員某某報稱，為向下開地區採辦食米，運滬接濟民食，請求發給證書等情前來，核尙相符，合行給予證明，至希沿途軍警”查騐放行，此證，計開採辦地區，品名，數量，到達地區，右給會員某某行號收執」，又此證爲防止流弊起見，經規定限半個月激銷，逾期無效。</p>
<h3>米糧貸款　試辦一月告結束</h3>
<p>關於貸款米之處理問題糧政處昨日發表謂，糧商貸款決定爲十億元，實際貸出九億四千萬元，貸款糧商均在蘇皖境內採購食米，絡續到埠，時適值各地糧價上揚，使貸款糧商於轉手間，即獲厚利，致引起本市米市塲上月十九日之騷擾，所有到埠之米，爰經該處佈吿停止出售，靜候貸款審核小組委員會商討解次，該委員會業於十日舉行第三次會議，決定將已在倉庫之糧貸米分批交由豆米行業公會在米市場拋售，其價格則較市價略低，至貸款商盈餘交由糧政處向糧商取具報表單據審核後，分別報會決定處置辦法，並經決定糧商貸款試辦一個月即行結束，通知各貸款糧商，即將本息一併繳還銀行云。</p>
<h3>建板到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局新輸鄧鏗號，首次開航福州，昨日返滬，所裝全係木板，計二萬五千餘件，尺碼不詳，</p>
<h3>美豬鬃業公會　電請改定尺碼</h3>
<p>〔天津訊〕勝利後，津市輸往美國之豬鬃，成色低劣，多不合標準，美國紐約豬鬃業同業公會及紐約美國　刷製造業公會，特聯名致電津市商會，規定豬鬃作法，及尺碼標準，茲將該電節譯如次：茲特代表敝國進口商及用戶電請貴商會注意出口豬鬃尺碼改革事項，以符標準。計二·二吋者四〇分，二·五吋者七〇分，二·七五吋以上者八十分，尺碼最低爲二·二五吋，成把吋全長須另加八分之一吋，（即如二又四分之一吋，豬鬃把須有二又八分之三吋長）。</p>
<h3>無織機　已在英國應用</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫救十三日電〕英國團比郡工廠正應用無梭織機製造織物。此種新機，能製造普通織機所不能製造之織物。在石絨原料上且可不斷編織，旣無雜聲，亦不震動。據稱一精巧之工人及一助理，能看守二十四架無梭織機，毫無困難。此機曾自動編織帆布八小時，並無工人在旁照顧。倘應用一適當之經綫，則可毫不停留繼續編織二十四小時。</p>

<h3>台東行腳　在太平洋的邊緣</h3>
<p>— 本報八日航訊　台灣特派員暮雲</p>
<p>在台灣，人們歡喜上台北，中，南去蹓躂，而台東則視爲畏途的。主要的原因還是地理環境決定了的，在中央山脈的西南北有着廣闊的平原，地勢平坦，生植着大量的農產品和台灣特產的茶，席，香蕉，西瓜，而台東除了沿太平洋的海灘邊，倘爾有着一條像帶似的平野，種植着稻以外，儘是峯巒，儘是山崗，居住着這裏的本省人和被閒居於山　中的番族一樣，和外界的接觸，保有着一定的限度，交通困難，運輸不能暢達，都是事實。</p>
<p>記者此行，自台北至台東，最要的不只是要廣泛地深入本省的各階層，而是要踏查着接收以後，當局的政治設施，在這地疥民荒的東太平洋邊緣的鄕村角落，進　的怎樣的深度，自然，美麗的風物，也是記者所追求的。</p>
<p>礦區行進</p>
<p>從省都到蘇澳，每天只有一班車是銜接着的，不在基隆而在離基隆不到一站的交叉點八堵。記者一行三人，搭乘十一時十七分的火車，十二時二五分便折入合東線，在剝了皮似的座椅上坐下米了。台省的交通經各方責難和長官的決心改革後，紛亂的現象已被調整了，行駛準時，軍人購票，排隊軋票，但要求從速修理和整頓車廂設置，目前還是苛求　因爲八十度以上的熱浪，使悶在車廂里的施客揮着扇都喘不過氣來，劣質的烟層，像雨打似的飄上面頰衣襟，　子在山之麓和山腰穿過，有四十多個隧通，讓車子通過，最長的需時四分鐘，我們不及細數，只感到在綿延數百里的礦山中，我們不是個旅客，而是辛克萊筆下的礦夫。</p>
<p>這一條絲，名符其實的礦區，暖暖的石炭，四脚亭，瑞芳的炭礦，是最好的產量最豊的，而瑞芳的金瓜石礦，文是有名的地方，礦區面積有五五一萬坪，十三年前金產額每年已達一，四八一瓩，銀塊四三九四瓩，銅三，〇二五，〇〇〇瓩，猴狪和武丹坑站，也是出產炭的，且是無烟炭，到大里簡站，可以看到無邊岸的洋面，在美麗奇冗的岩石羣中，過大溪，便可望見岸在洋面上離開陸地四　九的龜山了。</p>
<p>宣闌羅東是多雨的，在雨中，這一帶要不是有洋面，很可以令人回憶起，這裏原是江南的火地，近火車站的地，接連着的鄕村，瓦房和草屋，瓜棚和菜園，僅籬，榴花，戴着笠的牧人牽着水牛仔煤層公路上走，一行列的稻田，靜寂的橫躺在山麓，你很可以深刻的想到「江南風光處處同」吧？</p>
<p>三時三十分，到了宜闌線的終點——蘇澳，全程約自上海到杭州，爲時四時，二等聯票台幣四十八元。</p>
<p>蘇澳夜話</p>
<p>蘇澳不僅是台東一小鎭，且是全省最小的區。日本人過去設有郡，現在則改爲區署，隸屬於台北縣，這是東陲的一個荒山區，街梢的東西，就是洋面，西南北三方被山影包圍着。全區祇有五百多戶人家，總人口是三萬，區署以下只有一個鎭公所，它控制着十二個里，行政機構的簡單，怕在國內也是少有的。</p>
<p>碰到中央訓練團台訓班畢業的謝區長，（記者要特別提起中央訓練團台訓班的，因爲他們大部是作爲地方行政的主要幹部，和中央警校學生控制全省的警務，是兩支有力的系統）他很年靑，有幹才，像蹲在一座枯廟似的渡着晨鐘暮鼓的生活。他一月問來此，以上月間發生了不幸的暴動事件，使他灰心的不願再幹下去！他吿訴記者，在三廿月日上午二時三十分，該署發生大火，起因是工役們以習本省風俗，害怕地震，舉火祭祀後星火燎原，結果以沒有完美的消防設備，向鄰區的羅東消防隊借助，等趕到時，二八坪四合的區署辦公室已付之一炬，而四〇坪的房屋被拆毀了，確切的估價，損失在三百五十九萬台幣以上。這不能說只是區署的不幸，實是蘇澳區一二一萬人的大不幸，所有的日僑退的文件和五十年來的公事，統燬了。而在被災的同時，義勇警察隊却又肇生事端，致將該區長拳足交加，事後報吿了層峯，將肇禍人捉將縣警局去，義勇警察隊在解散之餘，八個禍首被囚人警備司令部，這塲風波，全省人莫不注目，尤其是這「有計劃」的「民衆暴動」，更給新台灣建設史上揭開了新頁。</p>
<p>區長繼續着說：「現在已由國軍一連，還有砲兵担任了維持治安的責任，很安靜」，接着他嘆了口氣：「失火的禍首聽說被保釋了……我是無論如何，不願再幹下去！』</p>
<p>在荒村山野的洋邊，我們度過了一脊，翌晨，是一個晴天，我們以八元車費搭上花蓮港的汽車，作東澳行。</p>
<p>蘇澳可以說沒有市面，沿洋出產着各種奇異的魚：烏賊，飛魚，鲔，旗魚，鳍，鯖和以魚翅間名內地的沙魚。港南鑿掘着丁字型水深二三米的南方澳，更是一個優良的漁港，有一個時期，滬台物價尙未平衡時，這里是最好的走私港口，現在則少了，爲的是沒有貨運出可以賺錢。不過這裏旅客雲集，到花運港的旅客，必需住夜始可搭車的，全程計一二〇公里，四月初因地　關係，距花蓮四五公里處震坍一段需要行走四十五分鐘，原定每日對開四車，現在則改爲二車了。</p>
<p>臨海之路</p>
<p>我們因爲愛看沿着太平洋邊緣的美景，順便去參觀一個小糖廠，費了一小時到了祇有一千人口的東澳，公路是在山之壁，鑿成一條蜿艇屈折的差堪單行的路，車是在緊靠着山崖行進，的有二三秒鐘就有一個S形的灣，從車窗外望，一面是可握手的翠綠的山，山連山，山環山，山繞山，山頂上有白雲，白雲戀愛着山，山之巔是靑天，另一面却是幽谷萬丈的斷崖絕壁，奇岩重疊，而蔚藍色的太平洋，緊吻着她。在車廂裏，設想若是在怎樣的奇境裏，不是親歷的實不能理解。你一定愛着高山大洋的雄偉壯麗的秀色，但你也一定能深感到這　是冒險的優美的旅味，日本人是把這頌爲台灣八景之一，我覺得國內像那樣險峻的斯蒂威爾公路，也不够那樣的美，爲了沒有洋，沒有汹湧的浪濤。</p>
<p>日本人怎樣竭盡心機，記者是更瞭解的了，從大正五年起到昭和六年四月，費時十五年，耗幣五百萬，犧牲了五十八名築成這條奮勝的路，把東台灣的交通聯繫了。從路面的工程，和山與山之間橋樑的構設，眞不會夢想到五十一年後的今天，它仍返回了中國，我謳歌臨海道路的偉大，控制自然的偉大，可是又不能不爲日本人政治上的短視和軍閥的跋扈而仰天嘆息！生命的活力，在這裹顯得更飛躍了，相信這是東方最偉大的美！</p>
<p>歸來，我們躺在草席上，將這條旅程回憶一下，有餘悸，有回</p>
<h3>在昆奮鬥八年·北返在即　西南聯大豎立紀念碑</h3>
<p>— 本報昆明七日航訊　特派員張生力</p>
<p>與抗戰相終始的西南聯大，已於「五四」在昆結束。北大，淸華，南開三校，即將遷返平津，光復舊業。從其南遷到北返，爲時將達九秋，該校之往事可按，吾人之記憶猶新，　述其槪略，藉供參考。</p>
<p>談到西南聯大，不乏毀譽參半之詞，見仁見智，記者姑不置議。而其艱苦與成就，則在戰時高等敎育中，留下了一個「五色交輝一的紀念碑。</p>
<p>舊創新痛　交相煎迫</p>
<p>聯大學生，泰半來自戰區，經濟困絀，生活艱苦。而昆明物價之高昂，常爲全國各地冠。彼等生活在「駝峯」式的生活指數下，多藉貸金，工讀，兼差等資助，以求學業之竟成。衣履不全，談不到日常營養。身心交困，更難期研究風氣加强。聯大來昆之初，學生多在各校兼任敎職，繼而擴展至各機關團體，繼而擴展至工廠與家庭，但以僧多粥少，向隅者仍眾。乃至有兼放昆市午炮者，事雖傳爲佳話，用心則已良苦，這種無孔不入兼差方式，益使彼等體認到都市生活的黑暗面。舊創新痛，交織於靑年身心，益以最高學府之中，言論業會硏究自由，彼等對未來富有理想，對現在具有敏感，對過去不易忘懷，故常有不平之鳴，與正義的呼聲。或表現於壁報，或表現於集會，或表現於宣傳遊行。毀譽參半之詞，殆即因此而遭致。所謂「聯大學生好事，」殆可由此而獲一解釋。至於別有用心的政治活動姑，不在此論列。</p>
<p>西裝革履　狀似要員</p>
<p>聯大文法學院，初設於滇南蒙自，彼等到達後，當地士兵見其西裝革履，疑爲中央要員，常向彼等立正敬禮。該縣產藤杖，價廉物美，聯大學生，人各一枝，益足以表現其「要員」風度。該校女生，係取道廣州，香港，海防，入滇，從香港帶去的奇裝艶服，允使當地民衆感到驚異。甚至有頑童包圍女生，俯視旗袍之內，是否尙有衣褲。其風氣可想而知。女生宿舍係租用當地首富周姓住宅。而其自修室則在城外，女生每晚結隊回宿舍時，必由校警武裝護送，以免受輕浮者的嘲　。其地物價極低，風景頗佳，人民生活均甚安閒。聯大師生，從炮火的威脅下，進入到這個靜而且美的境域，有些人頗感靜的苦惱。武漢大會戰前，「象牙之塔」裏的女生，在蒙自留下一門親戚。或曰：「這是聯大開張誌喜。</p>
<p>談到聯大學生在昆八年的生活自然不乏風雅逸事。但其中多爲悲劇，喜劇和鬧劇。彼等來昆之初，不明昆市習尙，男女同學，挽手並肩，行經市區，警察視爲有傷風化，當街罰打手心是「喜劇也。男女同學因戀愛問題，而至雙雙服毒自盡者亦有之。是一悲劇也。聯大初成立時，校舍窄，電燈少，學生無地自修，羣上茶館，抄筆記，做練習，或作橋戲，或擺龍門陣，高談鬧論者，旁若無人。切切細語者，如坐密室。一室之內，各有天地，一桌之隔，動靜逈殊。鳳翥街，文林街的茶館，雖因需要而大增，但以往來無鴻儒，顧客皆學生，淡水交易，獲利頗微。至於談情說愛者，多係廉價的應酬，一碗米綫或兩個燒二塊，食之津津有味，男女皆大歡喜。其中自然不乏鬧劇。</p>
<p>點的滋生綫的蔓延</p>
<p>滇緬路重開後，昆明風氣急劇變。其後美軍來崑，中印空運頻繁，昆市生活日益昂貴奢侈。這在精神物質上，均加深了對於聯大學生的威脅和苦惱。　客與「國際路綫」從點的滋生，漸成綫的蔓延。聯大學生既非信男善女一爲數雖極微，外界含沙射影之詞，亦使該踴聯大精神者，難辨其為「莫須有」。聯大學生，認為一此係該校醜劇，乃向校內「國際路綫」，作鳴鼓之攻勢。冷嘲熱罵，傳單四出，其風漸煞。</p>
<p>滇緬路重開後，昆明風氣急劇變。其後美軍來昆，中印空運頻緊，昆市生活日益昂貴奢侈。這在精神物質上，均加深了對於聯大學生的威脅和苦惱。掮客與「</p>
<p>滇西反攻戰開始後，昆市舞風漸起，至目前而太盛。在私人舞會中，固可常見聯大學生，而其出入營業舞塲者則極少。該校女生宿舍附近，有時可見迎送舞伴的吉普車，只足以引起一般人的注意而已，少見由此而多怪者。至於男生中的掮客，雖然未被一般人所注意，但與彼等談及茲事時，’內心亦甚苦惱，掮客的對象，多爲美軍及其有關人士。交易的物品，多爲買賣美金，美軍用品，中國特產或土產。這樣的人物，即在聯大的最後兩年中，亦不過百分之一二而已。</p>
<p>空襲時期一日數驚</p>
<p>一九四一年以前的聯大，學生活動範圍，多側重於校內，其時一的特點爲球賽，壁報，講演會，座談會。老牌的北大學生，雖對體育不感興趣，但亦常相吿語曰：「只有體育不能馬虎」。是乃愛淸華之賜也。其時來自華北，及港，滬及南洋的學生，運動興趣甚濃，技術亦較優。在馬的翰敎授的領導下，常獲市運會冠軍。滇緬戰局緊張時，昆市受空襲威脅，不特校內的課外活動因而沉寂，迎上校時間也一度改在早晚。一日數驚，師生情緒頗不安，美軍來華後，聯大學生出任譯員者數百人，其後更嚮應蔣委員長的號召，踴躍投効靑年軍，聯大精神至此又爲之一振。抗戰勝利後，國家仍多難。聯大亦多事，最顯著者爲「昆明學潮」。近半年中，市區內仍常見聯大學生充當報童，散發或出售自已的宣傳品，該校訓導長查良釗，至此也感到「欲哭無淚」！</p>
<p>三位常委　情同兄妹</p>
<p>聯大於二十七年「五四」在昆始業，至三十五年「五四」在昆結業。北大，清華，南開三校，旣有不同的歷史與各異的學風，而能在此八年中，苦辛支持，合作無間，這不能不歸功我聯大敎職員，尤其是三位領導人——蔣夢麟，梅貽琦，張伯苓。有人把聯大臀作一個大家庭，把三位常委比同三兄妹。蔣常委辦外交，梅常委主中饋張常委專駐陪都，担任聯絡，協助聯大的外交內政，辦外者放得開，主中饋者收得攏，交相爲謀，相得益彰。北大雖爲「五四」精神的搖籃，而新生的聯大，仍如「五四」前後的大家庭，其中不久新舊思想的矛盾。蔣當委對師生談話時，一則曰賽先生，再則　德先生，這仍是「五四」運動所努力的途徑。故在這大家庭中，縱有「違千夫之諾諾，作」士之諤諤」者，卒能兼容並包，「同無妨異，異不害同」。所指聯大精神，殆即在此。聯大之所以能和合八年而未分　者，恐亦因此而致。</p>
<p>風雨暉明　攀登峻嶺</p>
<p>談到聯大敎職員的生活，在過去入年中，並不是在栢油馬路上，與國難的人同看風雲，而是與戰士們肩負着同樣的任務，在風雨晦明中爬登峻嶺。所謂物質生沽，除吃粉筆灰外，多係賣文，　字，刋刻圖章，特約講演，或出賣舊衣物，或向親友借貸，至有特殊辦法者爲數頗少。所謂精神食糧，除一部份刧後餘書外，有時只能以美國軍中文化的遺物，當作水菓來欣賞。敎授們在這種情况中，縱然感到加於身心上的氣壓太高，仍少見其放下權充手杖的敎鞭。與其說是爲了今天而生活，倒不如說是爲了明日而行進。這一點，也足以表示聯大精神。</p>
<p>結業之期　豎碑紀念</p>
<p>關於聯大精神與聯大生活，記者所知，略而不詳，故只能作粗淺的報吿。該校結業之日，曾立紀念碑於校內，碑文出自馮友蘭敎授之手筆，堪稱歷史文獻之一，茲特引述該碑銘一詞，以作本文結語，銘曰：</p>
<p>「痛南渡，辭宮闈。駐衡州，又離別。更長征，繞嶢嵲。望中原，遍灑血。抵絕徼，繼講說。詩書喪，就有舌。儘茄吹，情彌切。千秋恥，終已雪。見仇寇，如烟滅。起朔北，迄南越。視金甌，已無缺。大一統，無傾折。中興業，繼往烈。維三校，兄弟列。爲一體，如膠結。同艱難，共歡悅。聯合竟，使命徹。神京復，還燕碣。以此石，象堅節。紀嘉慶，吿來哲！（五月七日寄自昆明）</p>
<h3>鎮江倉庫　任其物資封存　霉爛　多少流亡者痛感衣食兩缺</h3>
<p>— 八日鎮江通訊　陶</p>
<p>最近的鎭江，從各方面看起來，好像是外表沉靜，而是內容緊張，說得時間遠一點，就是自從後勤部的火藥庫大火後，便逐漸的在發動了。先是開始提早戒嚴的時間，接着便是加緊的抽查戶口，到現在則凡是重要據點，都做好了防禦的工事，一到深晚，便路廣人稀，江面的戒餒，下午黃昏以前，即行開始。任何船隻，均不得靠岸，揚州算是鎭江門戶，現在亦復加緊的戒備，在從前雖領有流亡證的難民，而今也失去了效用，不能進入城門一步，由北而來的船隻，祇許行到灣頭，即行靠岸，檢查而後步行，不但是國軍如此，據說共軍方面，也不同從前了。從前好像是任人通行，即携帶幾件行李，也是無大問題，現在則不然，不但行李辦不到，就是一些換身的掛褲，也須要費些唇舌’有時甚至連一封書信，也都在被禁之列。</p>
<p>人心浮動　謠言時起時滅</p>
<p>由於上面的這些事實和動態，腦筋稍為比較簡單一些的人兒，便不免慌張了起來，情勢所趨，大有「山雨欲來風滿樓」之概。其實，關於鎭揚一帶防務，是非常的鞏固，神經過敏的人，其結果總是庸人自擾，但是我們亦不能一槪而論，一味的在任意責備，那就是最近半月以來，外間的謠言。是特別的增多，是不是有人在作有作用的散佈，那是另一問題，比如火藥倉庫的火燒，明明是由於一根火柴的餘燼，而燃燒着了汽油，以致發生倉庫的大爆炸，但是傳說起來，總認爲是必有原因，甚至認爲是有計劃的舉動，在難民身上查獲了一支手槍，而傳說起來，又是甚麽輕機關槍，明明祗有一支，而傳說起來，總說是大批。像這樣謠言，鎮江人固然是莫衷一是，而竟然的一直傳佈到上海，有幾家報社，還特地來電，囑駐鎮的記者認真調查，其實根本就是那麼一回事一，那里還有其他？但是一旦到了一相當的時間而後，便也風消雲散，不攻自破了。</p>
<p>南通揚州　情況依然安靖</p>
<p>在不久的前幾天，南通方面，曾一度吃緊，可是經過幾日而後，便也轉危爲安。這因爲共軍對於這些地方，是時常放在嘴中宣傳的，而且一向都是如此，平靜了很長久的時間，一旦驟然的聽到通州吃緊，何能不令人引起注意？尤其是揚州，因爲在今日的運河線上，碩果僅存者，亦祗有這揚州一縣了，加上離揚不到十里路，便是共軍的最前線。鎭江人關心着揚州的問題，是比着關心鎭江的安危，還要厲害些。據一般來人的傳說：南通現已安靜如恒，揚州的防禦，亦是十分的堅强，但却苦惱了一般逃難者，現在是處處都得不到便利，弄成良莠不分，非有店保，莫想進城。蘇北高郵等縣，所有的船隻父多以揚州爲終點，現在交通發生了阻碍，須還在十幾里以外，即須靠岸下客，至於運貨）層，現在是格外談不到了。</p>
<p>可是難民雖然這樣地衣食艱難，而公家所封存的物資倉庫，却任性的聽其自然地腐敗，言來真是痛心。鎮江接收敵偽物資倉庫，大小共有百餘所。其中主要的十八處，由去年封存到現在，以時日來計算，是將近半年以上。後勤部現在才檢收竣事，是大麥一項爲三萬三千餘公斤，麩皮一萬多公斤，黃豆二萬餘公斤，精米三千餘公斤，糯米二萬餘公斤，餅干四千餘公斤，穀子一萬九千餘公斤，食鹽三萬四千餘公斤。可惜這些龐大的數字，却被霉爛兩字，要送去了一小半，霉爛而後，便等於成了一種廢物，用處毫無，還有被服雜件等，亦因封存時間較久，多年由潮濕而腐　爛，從外表看來，似乎還是不差，但是一按其實際的是打了一個七折以上的損失，這些物資，倘若早些時日，拿來賑濟或救濟難民，是多麽的實惠而切要！然而，截至現在爲止，寗可讓？封存蔚的物資聽其腐敗，而決不會來事先通融辦理一下，爲之奈何？</p>
<p>救濟協會　請求撥予救濟</p>
<p>旅鎭蘇北各縣的善後救濟協會，爲了這項問題，特地具了一篇可歌可立的呈文，請求將封存的物資，撥作救濟流亡難民之用，從這一篇呈文里，我們是一方面可以看見蘇北的現在的全貌，從另一方面里，我們也可以看出流亡者的慘狀。原文爲：</p>
<p>『竊本處由蘇北各縣善後救濟協曾合組而成，協助蘇省各服務機關，辦理蘇北流亡難民之救濟工作，近續據蘇北各縣流亡難民聲稱，共軍荼　蘇北，勝於洪水猛獸，自協商會議圓滿閉幕後，益形變本加厲，刑　士紳，裏脅壯丁，捐殺智識青年，沒收地畜產，其搜索糧草也，則有吃光隊之料合，拆毀房屋也，則有掃光隊之組織，其排除異已也，則有鋤奸隊之橫行，娛樂士兵也，則有婦女隊之征集一，其限制飲食與禁止搜行往來也，則有聞香隊與糾察隊之巡行，並將適齡壯丁，一律編爲民兵或後勤隊，以供其驅使，年幼之兒童，則成立兒童隊，嚴加訓練，人人裏腹，升合之糧無存，個個無家，片席之地難得，共軍佔領區各村鎭，每日但聞鑼聲嚮徹雲霄，實行其鬥爭毒策，强迫佃戶與地主鬥爭，倔工與老板鬥爭，店員與店主鬥爭，工人與廠主鬥爭，地痞流氓與智識份子鬥爭，甚至促使子與父鬥，妻與夫鬥，弟與兄鬥，妹與姊鬥，結果重則傷命，輕則破家入獄。其用心所在，無法澈底打破社會組織與家庭制度，必使田產收歸公有，少壯征爲軍隊，老弱聽其死亡。</p>
<p>今之所謂「解放區」，仰視其上，勢若殺心朗照，俯視其下，形同瘟神密佈，伏念各縣正人志士，處此空前浩刦之下，不惜捨死忘生，逃出險境，由此鄕關隔閡，資源斷絕，飄流異地，食宿無所，原期旌旗北指，還鄉有日，不圓消息沉沉，歸期莫下，事關軍國大計，何敢妄作希冀。但以各縣流亡難民，紛至沓來，而救濟機關物資之發散，又屬杯水車薪，若干流亡難民，仍有向隅之嘆。按本省接收敵偽物資，封存備用。為數甚鉅，堪以充作救濟流亡之用，而聯合國善後救濟總署運來救濟物資，堆積待放者，亦不在少數。如能提撥數成，普施救濟，則蘇北萬千難民，必同感再造之恩，從此民氣昭蘇，永銘不世之德。」</p>

<h3>義民的申訴</h3>
<p>主筆先生：我們有一千多個無家可歸而被政府認為有功抗戰的「義」民，有幾句話，請求貴報分出一點地位，登載出來。</p>
<p>抗戰軍興，朝野上下，一般愛國份子，曁販夫走卒，出錢出力，支持抗戰，追隨政府，跋涉萬里，拋家棄業，不惜犧牲，終能獲得勝利之基礎。這些事實，不能說小民完全有功，而較之貪生怕死，倒行逆施，認賊作父之順民，總算「差强人意」一點罷。</p>
<p>勝利業已十閱月，所有敵僞資產，已接收完了，政府亦於日前還都了。我們一般無知小民，也被免費遣回了。但是，還有許多因「貧」「亂」不能回家，蟻集各埠，「聽命由天。」一班當年抗戰死裏求生的可憐蟲，雖蒙政府，仁至義盡的設所收容，招待食宿，可是我輩無知小民，頗覺飽食終日，深感有浪費公物，虛擲光陰之慮。不料近句以來，救濟當局傳來就地疏散之言，揣其用意，以此類小民，旣不足爲今後『建國」之棟樑，復不具「民主』謀國之學識，大可聰共自生自滅，以不了了之。</p>
<p>雖然，我輩刦後餘生，飽經患難，回憶敵人過去之飛機大砲，終日轟擊，尙有爲生存必爭之勇氣，豈今日勝利歸來，眞個被政府拋棄而不求生嗎？設一旦疏散令下，或驅逐命出，充其量亦不過派來幾個糾糾武裝軍警，强制執行而已。</p>
<p>總之，我們是支持抗戰的沙泥，我們拚着生命換來一個「義」字，我們雖無資格坐汽車，吃大菜，享受一般强國人民享受的本能，但是我們爲着人類生存自然的慾望，我們有權要求政府把我們這班受盡戰禍無家可歸無力謀業的小民，迅施治標兼能治本的辦法。我們爲着上述原因，曾於四月三十日，報請上海分署僑胞第二招待所，轉請救濟當局，把我們作如下的措置：（一）請發生活補助費每名一萬元，因爲所中除給予食宿及遣送外，其他生活之必需，如理髮沐浴鞋襪等，概不供給，以致多數人髮長體垢，赤脚裂膚，狀至艱苦，所以請它發給補助費，解決上述問題。（二）請求增設學齡兒童識字班，圖書室，運動塲，（有地基）俱樂部，理髮室，沐浴室，產科病房，急病與傳染病房等。（三）請求分別調查各人知識能力，予以個別介紹職業，或集體生產。　先生。我們這些要求是對的嗎？可是呈報迄今句“，機關近在咫尺，竟延不批覆。日前推派代表，面述請求，而該署大老爺們，又不降尊接見，僅由一位「專家」，含糊作覆。我們回去集商之下，欲以行動未達到我們的要求，但是又顧慮到國法的尊嚴，未便過激。想來想去，只有寫下這篇東西，請求貴報迅予刋登，喚醒當局曁社會的注意與援助，期能使我們這班被棄的廢物，能得到各安生業，於公私兩有裨益的境地，而免流人歧途，貽害社會。</p>
<p>先生：我們萬分的歡迎你們抽空來視察一下，看看我們是否言過其實，幷請代我們問政府一聲，他們究竟預備把我們怎樣處置？善後救濟總署上海分署僑胞第二三所義民代表張漢潮陳蔚茹李尙詢李梁夏日煦周榮成崔耀東曹實全劉子舟盧之珍王鳳鳴張福堂吳金海杜耀彰同啓。</p>
<p>火車加價外之加價</p>
<p>主筆先生：最近京滬綫公佈開駛對號人座特快車，每票增收定座費五千元，而客運運價亦較最近訂定快車價爲高。例如由蘇至申，頭等票連定座費綜合計每票一萬三千餘元，二等爲九千四百餘元，且無三等票。按照未增價前之比較，竟達十三倍有奇。而「定座費」三字，更非一般人所能瞭解。豈火車行駛，乘客根本無得座位之權利乎？若謂因乘客擁擠，或寓禁單帮，則每一車廂旣有規定乘客人數，何不將各站售票額嚴格規定，或加開班次？且整車貨運旣仍未暢通，單帮者如有利可圖，即再增數百倍，亦難禁絕其圖利也。如謂路局支出不敷，則客票增漲，影響各物上漲，員司薪給即能增加，而物價與車價相互上漲，恐路局收支亦將永無平衡之一日，任事於斯者，亦必仍感生活困難。政府還都，一再以平抑物價為急要施政，乃路局何以竟有此治標不治本之設施耶？馮毅謹上。</p>
<p>配給病人的淡奶</p>
<p>編者先生：我是一個貧病交困的公務員。忽然聽說行總有魚肝油和淡奶配給病人，自然不勝欣喜，於是照章到祁齊路第四肺病診療所去申請。原以爲是完全免費的，但掛號的時候，才知道仍須繳納五百元的掛號費，和三千元的透視費，而領取魚肝汕的時候，還得繳付一千元的瓶子費。先生，你想這種辦法豈不大失救濟的原意嗎？六聽淡奶和兩磅魚肝汕照市價也不過一萬元，如今須付四千五百元的代價，豈不成了平價出售了嗎？我自然不反對申請的時候要掛號要檢查，但該所的收費標準實嫌太高一點了！因爲照規定，受配給的人每月須檢查一次，爲了自已和同病者的福利，希望先生把這件事在貴報揭示，請負責當局檢討一下，最好取消以後每月檢查一次的手續，以减輕病人的負祖；若不能取消，也希望盡量减低收費的標準。李同仁拜啓。</p>
<p>青年軍退伍以後</p>
<p>貴報載靑年軍將於本（五）月底退伍。依讀者愚見，最好請當局將靑年軍一部份同志訓練成中國優秀之警察。目前一般警察；智識較低，（且有若干曾在僞方服役過的）。關於警員學識方面，我想應以一個衛生警察，其本身對於一切衛生常識完全通曉，一個戶籍警察，能全都懂得戶籍保甲意義爲準則。同時希望建國有志有力的青年軍，大家來擔任這個偉大高尙的任務！徐元墇上</p>

<p>第一次大戰時，德國爲節約物力計，乃於一九一六年，首先採用此制，結果成績卓著，是年即省費用至兩億馬克之鉅，其後奧地利，荷蘭，丹麥，挪威，法國，意大利，葡萄牙，瑞典等國，百翠起採用，蘇聯亦於一九三〇年採用，至於英國，也因利益所在，潮流所趨，一改從前固執老態，而隨即採用了此種制度，但不知威雷特氏於九泉之下，作何感想？</p>
<p>英國實行此制的辦法，是於四月第三星期日（的四月十六日）午前或半夜子時後二時起，提早一小時，蓋此時人們多已休息，比時撥快鐘表，甚爲適宜，夏季過後，秋分時，晝夜已趨平分，乃又於十月第一星期日（的十月八日）午前或半夜子時後二時起，致晚一小時以還原。</p>
<p>然而，夏時制雖好，却無裨益於赤道附近之地方，蓋四季晝夜長短，隨緯度之高低而變，緯度愈高，則夏季白天愈長，居地球中部之赤道地方，緯度爲零，白天的太陽與晚上的月亮星星，每天均十二小時在地平綫上，十二小時在地平綫下，上下昇降，一年四李，晝夜等長，用不着實行夏時制，如是要採用，則人們須於沉沉黑夜中起來，非徒不能利用日光，反而浪費燈光，實屬庸人自擾，其於夏時制之初意，相去遠矣。地極處——在南北極　緯度爲九十度之地方——半年爲晝，半年爲夜，白天半年之太陽，與夜晚牛年之月亮星子，皆在地平綫上以相等高度週行，爲曰晝之半年，則太陽每天二十四小時皆在地平綫上作圓形運動，無我們所居之中低緯地方之太陽落山現象，而半年間之每日在地平綫上之高度亦不同，蓋白晝半年與夜晚半年，交換着到地平終上來，一來即盤據寳座半年之久，與我們這中低緯度地方之白晝半日與夜晚半日輪換）着到地平綫上來一樣，此種圓形運動，皆以北天上一點——即天球北極——爲中心，謂之星體之日週運動。在地極處，其軌跡半年中每天皆在地平線上，在中低緯地方，半天在地平線上，半天在地平線下，產生星體東出西沒之現象，太陽之出沒，即太陽日週運動之結果，故地極處，亦不宜採用提早一小時之夏時詞。北緯六十六度地方，夏至半夜，鯽見太陽在地平線上，上海約居北緯三一·二度地方，夏季晝長平均的十四小時許，早晨五時前，即已東方現曙，此時即行起床，非特能利用日光，及晚上提早就　，節約燈光，且浸浴於清晨新鮮空氣中，得享大自然美景，身心俱快，其增加工作效率，及促建找人健康，實非淺鮮。</p>
<p>英國地居北緯五十度至六十度之間，全國實行夏時制，實甚得宜。我國幅員廣闊，南至北緯的十度之團沙羣島，北至北緯線五十三度半之黑能江省漠河縣，因此，中北部實行夏時制，最爲得宜。唯沿南海岸及其以南地方，距赤道頗近，緯度甚低，實行夏時制，則與充分利用日光，節的燈光之初衷未符，比爲天文方面者。然行政上一個國家用兩種不同之時制，諸多不便，故以全國皆採用爲宜。去年五月一日起，至九月三十日止提早一小時，全國實行夏時制，結果成績優良，現在夏季又降臨了，希望此制別爲人所遺忘，即使當局來通令全國實仃，各機關學校，個別採用，亦同樣能享其益處的。去年全國實行夏時制以前，中央大學即早已實行，爲個別採用之例子。本文之作，即在介紹些優良之制度，甚望國人勿失之交臂，即行採用焉。</p>

<p>人生</p>
<h3>漫談希望</h3>
<p>— 沈雲崗</p>
<p>我曾經聽見）個人說過；一人生好比一輛永遠不停的車子，只許一直向前進，不許朝後退。」</p>
<p>倘若這語句是確實的話，那末我對於「希望」這個抽象的名詞，好有一比，比做什麽？比做批動車子前進的原動力。</p>
<p>所謂推動車子前進的原動力云者。即：是馬車，便是驢馬；是電車，便是電力；是火車汽車，便是汽。</p>
<p>車子沒有原動力即不能前進，換句話說，人生也是一樣，缺乏了希望，即缺乏了使人「活下去」的勇氣！</p>
<p>記得從前有一個故事，在一個村莊裏，有一個終年辛動工作的石匠，他永遠不停地敲鑿石器，可噹可噹，除去了睡眠吃飯之外，整個的時間都化費在工作上面。</p>
<p>一天，有一個天眞的小孩子走近了他，好奇的問：「你爲什麼永遠這樣辛勞的工作呢？」</p>
<p>他懊惱地說：「咄！辛勞的工作可以賺錢。」</p>
<p>小孩子又問：「賺些錢何用？」</p>
<p>「賺錢可以維持生活。」</p>
<p>「維持生活後怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「小鬼！」石匠憤恨地說：「維持了生活，可以依舊鑿石器。」</p>
<p>「鑿了石器怎樣。」討厭的小孩又問地。</p>
<p>「？！！」石匠不禁呆住了　。</p>
<p>是的，石匠此時覺察自己的可憐了，工作，吃飯，工作，吃飯……以至於死。</p>
<p>第二天這村莊裏便沒有了石匠的擊石聲。</p>
<p>這是一個很簡單的故事，它吿訴了我們，希望對於人生的重要，失去了希望的人，是不能發出工作的力量了，正如一輛車子，缺少了原動力就不得不拋錨一樣。</p>
<p>西班牙有一個詩人說：「希望好比一個娼妓，喜歡對人擠眉弄眼，勾搭人，對人生加以引誘和蠱惑。」</p>
<p>不錯‘希望是一個不安本分的女人，她喜歡做媚跟，勾搭人，引誘人走上正路，也蠱惑人踏上歧途。</p>
<p>許多人爲它捨身流血，許多人爲它流芳百世，許多人爲它遺臭萬年，這裏要注意的便是一切的希望都須把人類大衆的幸福作標準，流芳百世，遺臭萬年的分野便是在此。</p>
<p>當心茄，朋友們：身畔蠱惑的奸邪的希望是否已融洽了你，調和了你。</p>
<p>「希望」，這個傢伙，也使很多的人發了瘋，很多的人爲牠　哭，很多的人為牠悲不予生，間或亦有很多人抱住了一個永不能完成的希望，冤枉的殺害了自己，如李太白一樣，吃醉了酒，想撈水中的月亮，盲目的喪了生。生。</p>
<p>所謂不能完成的希望者，即是過度的「奢望」。希望而成了「奢」，是如何的無聊，如何的浪費，久而久之，終於成了失望一</p>
<p>俗語說：「哀莫大於心死，」要知道「心死」就是失掉了希望。</p>

<h3>浦東的喜訊</h3>
<p>— 漢生</p>
<p>最近據報載，對於浦江建橋已有計劃實施。這無異是浦東人士的喜訊，也是上海人的福音！因為抗戰八年，上海地勢特殊，而形成畸特繁盛。連住屋也發生恐慌，真是「粥少僧多」。雖然說外國將要運活動房屋來，但這過份的人口，終有一天會使活動房屋無地可安置的嚴重階段。</p>
<p>上海是全國工商麕集之地，而國家之經濟中心亦在於是。所以上海人無屋可住，弄成嚴重的社會問題，實有影響工商經濟發展，而國家亦將蒙害。所以當局</p>
<p>橋，以便郊區和上海市區打成一片，實現「大上海」的</p>
<p>有計劃終有動工的一天，能動工當然必有成功的一天，如果實現了：我們能經過這有趣的大橋，俯瞰浦江的浪花，看橋下的艦艇穿梭似的在大橋的高肚子下來往，我們或許要狂呼了！</p>
<p>大橋一造，浦東的良田將要做設廠的基地了，烟囱裏的黑烟裊裊地在浦東空中跳舞，好像應祝着爲建國的途程上打了一個有力的基石，浦東有的是空地，在上海的市民，也可勻些來，有了大橋，還怕不便嗎？「浦東萬歲！」我將這樣地域．</p>

<h3>Representatives of Various Parties to Arrive in Beijing Within Days; Preparations for the Resumption of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Subgroup Meetings; Marshall and Zhou Enlai to Meet Again</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] According to Shao Lizi, among the three meetings that may be convened soon, the PCC Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting is scheduled to be held after the arrival in Beijing of the CCP representatives left in Chongqing, such as Bi Wu, as well as representatives of the Democratic League and the Youth Party. The CCP representatives Dong Biwu and He Sijing, originally scheduled to arrive in Beijing today, have changed their flight to the 14th due to inclement weather. The Democratic League representative Luo Longji has arrived in Chongqing from Kunming and is scheduled to arrive in Beijing before the 20th. In addition, it is rumored that representatives of various parties remaining in Shanghai who will attend the Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting will also arrive in Beijing within the week. Judging from the recent actions of representatives of various parties, even if the Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting is held, it will likely be next week. The previous suggestion that the Second Plenary Session of the Political Consultative Conference would be convened seems to be no longer necessary at present. Zhou Enlai met with Marshall at 3:00 PM on the 13th and spoke for an hour. It is said that the content of the talks included not only the Northeast issue but also the situation of the KMT and CCP armies in central Hubei, northern China, and northern Jiangsu. After Zhou departed, according to sources close to Marshall, Marshall has listened to the opinions of both the government and the CCP since arriving in Beijing. When necessary, he may consider taking the opportunity to listen to the opinions of the Chinese people, as listening to multiple perspectives is not only beneficial for reference but also extremely helpful for negotiations on Chinese unity and unification. It is said that Zhou Enlai is scheduled to meet with Marshall again at 3:00 PM on the 14th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] General Marshall held talks with Chairman Chiang and discussed matters with Yu Dawei daily. Yu, proficient in English, acts as an intermediary for Chairman Chiang. General Zhang Qun, one of the representatives of the "Peace Talks" on internal affairs, arrived in Beijing today to meet with General He Yingqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Xinmin Daily quoted reliable sources as saying: KMT-CCP negotiations will resume soon, but there is no need to convene a second session of the Political Consultative Conference, as the unresolved government reorganization, draft constitution, and military issues will be discussed by the PCC Comprehensive Subgroup, the Constitution Review Subgroup, and the Military Three-Man Group. Marshall, Zhou Enlai, and Bedell Smith met this morning. [Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] A newspaper reported: The ten-member Comprehensive Subgroup Committee of the Political Consultative Conference will be convened by Shao Lizi on May 20th at the Nanjing National Assembly Hall. Two representatives from each of the government, the Communist Party, the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and independent factions will participate. In addition, the Constitution Review Committee will also reopen soon to continue discussions. The committee has a total of thirty-five members, including five representatives from each of the five parties and ten experts.</p>
<h3>US Government Economic Aid to China; Marshall Has Veto Power Over Loan Rumors</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Although the current pressing political and military problems in China are fraught with difficulties, there is still strong hope for a solution. Various rumors outside suggest that the situation in the Northeast is deadlocked and a large-scale civil war is imminent. This ignores the facts and is unaware of the Chinese habit of bargaining. The so-called facts include the following two points:</p>
<p>(1) The KMT and CCP armies have been sworn enemies for eighteen years. Since the ceasefire order was implemented on January 13, the two sides have been confronting each other in various places, separated by only an arrow's distance. Apart from unavoidable minor conflicts, they have not yet crossed the original defense line to an irrecoverable situation.</p>
<p>(2) Both the KMT and CCP are willing to continue political consultations, which shows that the door to negotiations has not been closed, and a compromise solution can be reached at any time. Marshall has a very clear and fair grasp of the Chinese situation. In addition, both the KMT and CCP recognize that world opinion expects peace and democracy in China and is becoming impatient. When this reporter left Yan'an, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong told me that although the current situation is not as good as it was when the ceasefire agreement, the military reorganization plan, and the PCC agreement were concluded in January, he and the CCP remain optimistic. Mao also said that setbacks are inevitable, but democracy and unification are imperative. World trends and world opinion, with the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom as examples, must make this happen.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] News here today: President Truman's special envoy, Marshall, has absolute veto power over the $500 million loan to China. This is the most powerful authority that the US President has given to a special envoy, so that he can implement the US policy abroad. According to diplomatic authorities, President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes are planning to use American gold to achieve American goals, and China is a clear example. When Special Envoy Marshall was ordered to go to China in December last year, President Truman announced that US economic assistance to China depended on the degree of internal stability in China. In March of this year, Marshall returned home to report on his work and held several meetings with Truman. China once applied for a total of 2 billion yuan in cash loans and credit loans. At that time, negotiations between the National Government and the United States were expected to obtain 500 million yuan, but it was heard that Marshall intended to use this to win over the National Government and the CCP to strengthen China's strength. This loan had already been prepared by the Export-Import Bank, ready to be paid, but was suddenly suspended and all powers to handle the loan and all other Sino-US relations were given to Marshall to act expediently. During Marshall's return to the country, the military reorganization plan he proposed to stop the conflict between the KMT and the CCP and gradually merge the two armies was broken due to the Northeast issue. Marshall's return to China this time is to address how to restore his mediation mission after the setback. The only effective weapon is to control the US loan. As for the US troops stationed in China, they have now been reduced to about 30,000, only responsible for guarding.</p>
<h3>Wan Yaohuang Sworn in as Chairman</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 13th] The new chairman of Hubei, Wan Yaohuang, was sworn in today. Cheng Qian, director of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, specially appointed by the Central Government, supervised the oath. He conveyed Chairman Chiang's instructions on the spot, encouraging him to protect the good and kind, guard against violence and eliminate evil, refresh politics, and be realistic.</p>
<h3>Wang Lingji's Plan to Govern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Jiujiang to Become a Model County; Lushan to Become a World-Class Park</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jiujiang, 12th] Jiangxi Chairman Wang Lingji, received a grand welcome from all circles in Xun at Tongwen College here on the afternoon of the 12th. Wang said in his speech: Jiujiang and Lushan, one is the gateway to western Jiangxi, and the other is a world-famous scenic spot. It is hoped that the former will be built into a model county in Jiangxi, and the latter into a world park. This is the second check I have issued since coming to Jiangxi. Whether it can be cashed depends on everyone's joint efforts.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Sichuan Rice to Aid Hubei; US Landing Craft Transported to Hankou</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 13th] The first 24 tons of Sichuan grain transported by US landing craft from Chongqing have arrived in Hankou and will be sold at fair prices immediately. This is part of Sichuan's grain aid to Hubei. In the future, the landing craft will continue to transport grain. In addition, a total of more than 6,480 tons of materials were transported from Shanghai to Hankou in April, mostly flour.</p>
<h3>Pauley to Go to North Korea; Soviet Union Has Not Yet Permitted</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] After the US Reparations Commissioner Pauley and his advisors arrived here, they have not yet received permission from the Soviet Union to enter North Korea. They plan to first go to the US-occupied area in South Korea and the nine eastern provinces of China to study Japan's economic facilities in those areas, and what equipment and industries remain that can be used for reparations. According to Pauley, he plans to set up two offices, one in Seoul and the other in Shenyang, with 26 staff members. The staff will depart from the offices to work separately. Pauley himself plans to reside in Seoul and will depart within this week.</p>
<h3>Fire Accidentally Breaks Out in Admiral Fraser's Residence Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 13th, United Press] The office and residence of Admiral Fraser, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet, accidentally caught fire this afternoon. It is believed that the internal damage was heavy, and the roof also collapsed, but it was gradually extinguished by a large number of firefighters and naval personnel. Fraser himself is currently in Tokyo and is scheduled to return to Hong Kong in a few days. China Merchants Bureau Participates in Four New Ships</p>
<h3>Maritime Transport Between Tianjin and Shanghai</h3>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Participates in Four New Ships</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] Maritime transport between Tianjin and Shanghai is intermittent. The China Merchants Bureau has recently named four new ships purchased from the United States "Huang Xing," "Qi Mei," "Yan Jian," and "Zhi Xin" to participate in maritime transport between Tianjin and Shanghai. The four ships are all over 1,000 tons, with a draft of 13 feet, and can directly reach the Tianjin wharf. "Zhi Xin" and "Huang Xing" have arrived in Tianjin one after another and will sail to Shanghai in the near future.</p>
<h3>Tanggu Salt Fields Repaired; Monthly Production of 20 Tons</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dagu, 13th] The salt fields and salt farms in Hangu, Dagu, and Tanggu have been repaired. The Tanggu salt fields can produce about 20 tons per month. The salt washing fields in Hangu and Dagu are too damaged and need to be repaired.</p>
<h3>Military Personnel Compensation and Benefits; New Adjustments Coming Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 13th] According to semi-official sources, the compensation and benefits of military personnel will be newly adjusted, increasing the currently stipulated salary and allowances by three times. The truth remains to be verified.</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department Holds Meetings All Day; Negotiating Military Reorganization Agencies and Their Use; Individual Cases of Fengjiakou and Botou Occupied by the Communist Army Also Discussed</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] The Military Mediation Department held a military reorganization meeting on the morning of the 13th to discuss military reorganization agencies and their use, but it awaits a decision by the Chiefs of Staff meeting. According to those involved, before the overall situation is determined, concrete progress in military reorganization cannot be expected. In the afternoon, there was a Chiefs of Staff meeting to discuss the Communist army's occupation of Fengjiakou and Botou. The Communist side said that this was a pursuit by the Communist army to avenge the annihilation of 100 of their friendly troops. As a result, the Botou team was first ordered to investigate the process, and then it was decided whether the Communist army would withdraw. [Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Regarding the CCP's expression to revise the military reorganization plan, the CCP personnel in the Executive Headquarters here also expressed their views today, saying that the situation has changed, and the original plan should be revised. They also said that the CCP has informed the government and the US that the ratio of three to one for military reorganization in the Northeast is no longer applicable.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Preparatory Meeting Adjourns; Organization of the Executive Committee Established; Expressing Consistent Initial Intention to Study the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Adjournment speech of the National Assembly Preparatory Meeting: Representatives of the National Assembly are elected by the people and bear the important responsibility of drafting the constitution. However, due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance, ten years have passed without a meeting. We are awed by our responsibilities, so we organized the National Representatives Friendship Association in the provisional capital, Chongqing. When the government accepted the public's opinion and all parties negotiated and unanimously decided to convene the meeting on May 5 this year, we went to the capital in response to the call, but the government's order to postpone it suddenly came. Our Association, adhering to its consistent initial intention of promoting constitutional government, held a preparatory meeting on May 1, holding a total of thirteen meetings. Although the time was short, much has been gained, and it was decided to organize a Constitution Draft Research Association. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government had a discussion with all the representatives of our Association on the 7th of this month. We expressed our consistent initial intention, stating that the National Assembly should be convened as soon as possible, the constitution should be drafted as soon as possible, and the government should have its limits on the tolerance of those who obstruct constitutional government. Chairman Chiang delivered a speech on the spot, expressing his concern for the overall situation and his sincere intentions. The representatives all expressed their admiration. What we, all of us, want to tell our compatriots across the country is that the government is determined to implement constitutional government and sincerely hopes to reconvene the National Assembly and enact the constitution as soon as possible. The postponement this time is indeed for the country and the people, and there are unavoidable reasons. However, we representatives feel even more that if a just and constitutional government cannot be promoted, it will be easy for a few party members to hold sway. In the future, if we want to urge the reopening of the Assembly and the enactment of the law, we must gather public opinion and promote civil rights. The Preparatory Meeting should still be based on the regulations and will not be closed until the Assembly convenes. The Preparatory Meeting has been held twelve times. In the future, the main task is not in the meeting, but in the work. Therefore, during the adjournment period, the Executive Committee of this meeting will be responsible. The National Representatives Friendship Association has organizations in various places. During the adjournment period, we will still study the draft constitution in the capital with the greatest determination. The Friendship Association will still promote this matter from the beginning, as it has done for the past two years. We dare to express our sincerity to the people of the country.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The National Assembly Preparatory Meeting held its twelfth meeting on the morning of the 13th, chaired by Xiang Ju Tan, to discuss the draft articles of association for the organization of the Executive Committee after the adjournment of the meeting. After careful study and revision, it was passed. The members of the committee are at least one person per unit, two persons for more than ten persons, three persons for more than twenty persons, and so on. The Executive Committee will regularly attend the meeting during the adjournment period of the Preparatory Meeting to handle all meeting affairs, and is divided into seven groups: General Affairs, Documents, Finance, Investigation, Public Relations, Research, and Propaganda. Meetings will be held once a week. Then, the chairman announced that the meeting would be adjourned on the morning of the 14th, and each unit would elect the executive officers of each unit on the 13th and submit them to the Assembly on the 14th for legal establishment.</p>
<h3>Personnel Left in Beiping for Northeast Reception; Ordered to Depart for Shenyang Again; The Situation in the Northeast May Have New Developments</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] The personnel left in Beiping for the Northeast reception have now been ordered to go to Shenyang again to prepare for military reception. Generally, it is judged that there may be new developments in the Northeast situation recently. Here, the personnel of the Jilin Provincial Government have been scheduled to go to Pan on tomorrow (the 14th). Chairman Zheng Daoru, who has been ill in Beiping for a long time, is also scheduled to go on the 16th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 13th] According to Communist Northeast news, the Communist army in Sipingjie and Benxi is still resisting. The battle in Sipingjie has been going on for 23 days and is still defended by the Communist army. The National Army attacking Sipingjie has seven divisions, with a firepower of 1,800 rounds per hour. It is said that the National Army can see the city, but cannot break in.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 13th] TASS News Agency reported from Dalian that on the 1st and 2nd of this month, 2,000 US Marines landed on Huludao, aiming to accelerate the National Army's entry into the Northeast by US ships. The plan is obviously to take the National Army from Qingdao to Huludao by sea, and then go to Shenyang by land. The troops are trained and equipped by the US, and carry artillery, mortars, and tanks.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shijiazhuang, 13th] Liu Bocheng's troops in the Taihang Military Region of the Communist Army, numbering more than 50,000, have recently concentrated in the Gaoyi area, preparing to go to the Northeast.</p>
<h3>First Batch of UNRRA Freight Cars; Allocated to Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 13th] The first batch of seventeen freight cars allocated by UNRRA to the Jiaoji Railway has been assembled and handed over to the Railway Bureau for use. Each car has a load capacity of 20 to 50 tons. However, the Jiaoji Railway is currently severely damaged, and it is impossible to predict when it will be opened.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Adjusting Salaries and Allowances for Civil Servants; Proposer Explains Reasons; To Ensure Peaceful Service to the Government, a Way to Solve the Problem Should Be Found</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] After the "Regulations on Adjusting Salaries and Allowances for Civil Servants and Teachers" passed at the previous meeting of the Legislative Yuan were published, civil servants and teachers were very concerned and inquired about the process and content of the proposal. The proposal was drafted by legislator Jian Bi San and others, and submitted by Lou Tong Sun, Chen Gu Yuan, Zou Shan Qun, Chen Hai Cheng, Hu Xuan Ming, and 33 others. After the General Assembly passed the principles, the President of the Yuan appointed Jian Bi San, Chen Xiao Cen, and Li Qing to supplement the proposal based on the opinions expressed by the members, and then submitted it to the National Defense Supreme Committee for speedy approval and implementation. The reasons and methods of the proposal are summarized below: Reasons: Since the War of Resistance, the lives of civil servants and teachers have been increasingly strained due to the endless rise in prices, to the point where they can hardly maintain themselves. During the War of Resistance, with the enemy in front, victory came first, and civil servants and teachers, while enduring hardships, still worked hard to the end without fear or complaint. Now that victory has arrived, and the rivers and mountains are restored, the lives of civil servants and teachers are even worse than during the war. The past is reminiscent of the present, which is disturbing. Civil servants and teachers buy their knowledge and energy to serve the country, and the government should maintain their appropriate standard of living so that they can serve with peace of mind. After the return to the capital, the great cause of national construction requires civil servants and teachers to work harder. If the government properly finds a way to solve the problem of their livelihood at this time, it will be of great benefit to administrative efficiency and the future of education. We are aware of this and dare not remain silent. We hereby propose the following methods for adjusting the salaries and allowances of civil servants and teachers, and request that they be forwarded to the National Defense Supreme Committee for speedy approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Methods: (1) The multiple of the increase in salaries should be calculated at least according to 1,000 times before the war.</p>
<p>"Explanation": Now the monthly wages of male and female workers are more than 3,000 to 10,000 times before the war. The salaries of civil servants and teachers should be calculated at least 3,000 times one-third of the minimum wage of workers (that is, 1,000 times) to show fairness.</p>
<p>(2) The monthly living allowance should be at least 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>"Explanation": The living allowance was originally intended to subsidize clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Now the prices of rice, grain, fuel, cloth, and rent have risen to more than 5,000 to 10,000 times before the war. For a family of three or five, according to the current price situation, it will cost at least 200,000 yuan per month just for the most basic eating and housing.</p>
<p>(3) A proper way should be found to distribute goods in kind so that civil servants and teachers can truly benefit.</p>
<p>"Explanation": The distribution of goods in kind during the war did have the effect of supporting the long-term war of resistance, but the various procedures for collection, transportation, and distribution required too much time, people, and money, which was not economical for both the public and private sectors, and was prone to abuse, which seemed to be inconsistent with the government's original intention of distributing food. If the government distributes goods in kind again, it should find a proper way based on past gains and losses so that civil servants and teachers can truly benefit. Before a proper way is determined, at least 200,000 yuan should be issued per month for them to purchase rice and fuel on their own.</p>
<p>(4) The above two methods should be implemented from March 35. "Explanation": The methods for adjusting the salaries and allowances of civil servants and teachers in March of this year were lower than in February. The Central News Agency accurately analyzed this based on facts and published it in newspapers across the country, and civil servants and teachers expressed their sympathy. Moreover, since March, prices have risen sharply every day, and civil servants and teachers have been unable to make ends meet. Therefore, this proposal should be implemented from March to live up to expectations.</p>
<h3>The President of the Yuan Returned to Beijing from Shanghai Yesterday; To Preside Over the Executive Yuan Meeting; Personnel Changes May Be Announced Today or Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The changes in the heads of the three municipalities and two provinces, and the personnel changes of partial reorganization, will be decided separately at the Executive Yuan meeting and the joint meeting of the National Defense Supreme Committee and the Central Standing Committee on the 13th and 14th. It is heard that Shanghai Mayor Qian Dajun may be transferred to be the chairman of a certain province, but whether it will be announced at the same time on the day after tomorrow is still undecided. Also, Chairman Wang Maogong of the Jiangsu Provincial Government came to Su yesterday to report on his work, and Chairman Li Pinxian of Anhui is also planning to come to Beijing in the near future.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan flew back to Beijing from Shanghai at 9:00 AM today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by his wife Zhang Leyi and his adopted son Zi An, flew to Beijing from Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, and will attend the Executive Yuan meeting today. Among those who accompanied him were Zhu Guangmu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Jiang Jiping, and Yin Zhongrong. At the end of the meeting, a draft of the adjournment declaration of the General Assembly was read, and all members unanimously passed it. In addition, because the Chongqing Shishi Xinbao published an editorial condemning the National Assembly representatives, the content was subjective in terms of wording, which caused fierce debate among all the representatives.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang held a meeting in his department at 3:00 PM on the 13th to generally receive the trade union representatives attending the National Assembly, with 24 people attending. The representatives all expressed their opinions on the organization of trade unions and the future of industry. The problems were all in line with the needs of the country and were very pertinent. At the end, Minister Gu gave a comprehensive answer and expressed his willingness to work with everyone to implement various regulations quickly.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] I just met Mr. Chen Texiang, a representative of the people of the country, who arrived in Beijing from Shantou. According to him, there is a grain shortage in Shantou. Before the war, 10,000 bags of rice were imported every day. Currently, this source is completely cut off because Shanghai rice is prohibited from being exported. The current price of rice has reached 130,000 yuan per stone. According to Chen, the most imported material in the Shantou market is remittances from overseas Chinese, about 50 million to 100 million per month, all of which are remitted by overseas Chinese. The population of Shantou is seventeen or eight, especially</p>
<h3>Zhang Daofan and Gu Weijun Both Deny Taking New Positions</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] This newspaper's reporter immediately asked Chairman Zhang Daofan, who was in Shanghai, whether he would take the position of Nanjing Mayor. Zhang said: Please make a "100% denial" on my behalf. He claimed to be a cultured person, accustomed to a free and unfettered life, and expressed his lack of interest in restrictive positions such as mayor. However, when a reporter asked what he would do if the government insisted on making it difficult for him, Zhang said: "I will have to consider it before making a decision."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] According to Gu Weijun, our ambassador to the United Kingdom, he still intends to be an envoy abroad, and the rumor in Beijing and Shanghai that he will take the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs is not true. Regarding the issue of recovering Hong Kong, Gu said that it is only a matter of time. It is heard that Gu still intends to go to Shanghai in the near future, and also intends to go to Beiping within the month.</p>
<h3>Confiscation of Traitor Chen Gongbo's Property; Jiangsu High Court Requests Execution; Traitor Lin Baisheng Indicted by Beijing High Court</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Office, 13th] Chen Gongbo, the traitor, was previously sentenced to death by the Jiangsu High Court, and it was also decreed that all his property be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family. Although his wife, Li Lizhuang, is currently applying for a retrial regarding the death sentence, the judgment to confiscate the remaining property must be enforced. The Jiangsu High Procuratorate sent a memorandum on the 13th to the Capital and Guangdong High Procuratorates, requesting that it be sealed off. [Our Nanjing Office, 13th] Indictment by the Prosecutor of the Capital High Court: Defendant Lin Baisheng, male, 45 years old, from Xinyi County, Guangdong Province, resident of No. 73 Shanghai Road, Nanjing, bogus Governor of Anhui Province, currently in custody. (1) Facts of the crime: In December of the 27th year, the traitor Wang's notorious telegram from Hanoi was released by Baisheng in the South China Daily. On January 17th of the 28th year, he was attacked, and later secretly went to Shanghai to participate in the bogus Sixth National Congress, and served as a bogus Central Executive Committee member, negotiating a "Peace Foundation Plan" with the enemy and serving as a bogus Minister of Propaganda. In the 31st year, he also concurrently served as the bogus Secretary-General of the New National Movement Promotion Committee, the bogus Director-General of the Youth Corps, and the Secretary-General of the Model Corps. On January 9th of the 32nd year, as a member of the entourage, he concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with the Japanese invaders. In the spring of the 34th year, he was transferred to serve as the bogus Governor of Anhui Province and the bogus Pacification Director of Bengbu. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, he fled to Japan out of fear of punishment and was later detained and sent back to China. (2) Evidence and legal articles violated: He confessed to all of the above positions without hesitation. His confessions are completely consistent with the confessions of his accomplices, Mei Siping and Li Shengwu, in other cases. During his tenure as the bogus Minister of Propaganda, he repeatedly published articles and broadcasts arguing that resistance would inevitably fail (all found in the pasted newspaper clippings). In his book "From September 1st Remembering September 9th," he did his utmost to slander and smear the supreme leader's national policy of leading the war of resistance. His actions constitute a crime under Article 2, Section 1, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. In accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed. Prosecutor: Chen Shengzu. Clerk: Li Zhishen.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Office, 13th] After the traitor Chu Minyi was sentenced to death, his legal wife, Chu Chen Shunzhen, applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial. At 11:00 AM on the 13th, Ms. Chen ordered her daughter, Chu Mengyuan, to come to Suzhou from Beijing and submit a supplementary statement of reasons to the Jiangsu High Court. The content criticized the original judgment as purely a subjective political argument, and finally weighed the sentence with an objective legal argument. It defended the defendant in two points: political argument and legal argument. It briefly stated that the defendant held important positions in the bogus government for several years and had not committed any acts harmful to the people. Even if the crime of collusion with the enemy is established, it should not be rashly concluded that he intended to resist the country. It requested that the original judgment be abolished and a more fair judgment be made. The full text is over four thousand words, entirely in vernacular Chinese, and the arguments are based on no concrete favorable evidence, purely empty sophistry.</p>

<h3>Two Important Agencies Established Within the Ministry of National Defense; Strategic Committee Directly Under the Head of State; He Yingqin Willing to Set an Example for Veteran Generals</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The second memorial week after the return to the capital was held at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 13th, presided over by Chairman Chiang. Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin reported on: (1) the implementation of the twelve tasks undertaken by the Army Headquarters, such as accepting surrender and repatriating prisoners of war; (2) the adjustment process of military agencies; and (3) the real situation of housing allocation in Nanjing. He first described the process of the Army Headquarters presiding over the acceptance of surrender, repatriation of prisoners of war, disbandment of puppet troops, relief of refugees, and restoration of transportation in various war zones, as well as handling party and government matters in the recovered areas. He then stated: After the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, according to the new system, the General Staff Headquarters and the Strategic Advisory Committee will be established. This system aims to simplify and streamline military agencies. The future national defense army should select outstanding young people to enrich cadres at all levels so that they are energetic and efficient. All first-level generals aged 62, second-level generals aged 60, and lieutenant generals aged 56 should retire according to law. Those who have not reached the retirement age and are academically capable and experienced can serve as members of the Strategic Advisory Committee. The committee is one of the agencies of the Ministry of National Defense and is directly under the head of state who commands the three armies. In peacetime, it studies major national defense plans, and in wartime, it serves as a commander. He Yingqin is willing to take the lead in implementing this policy, setting an example for veteran generals and blazing a trail for the national defense army. Finally, He reported on the housing allocation situation in Nanjing, stating briefly: After Nanjing fell, 4,800 houses were destroyed, and only 170 were added. This is the main reason for the housing shortage. After the victory, the Army Headquarters received eight houses, which have now been allocated to various central agencies. After He Yingqin finished his report, he announced the completion of the ceremony.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] During the central memorial week report on the new system of the Ministry of National Defense, Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin slightly revealed his intention to retire. He said, "In February and April of this year, I twice earnestly expressed to Chairman Chiang that once the Ministry of National Defense is established, I would very much like to retire as a member of the Strategic Advisory Committee to serve the future transcendent national defense army." It is heard that the position of Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense has not yet been determined. Because He Yingqin has publicly stated that he will not take this position, and those in the military who are qualified to fill this position are all deferring. However, military sources believe that a decision will be made within the week. As for the report that the Minister of National Defense will be filled by a civilian, it is absolutely not true. The preparations for the relevant military agency reorganization matters are largely complete. The Reorganization Committee will begin working at the Army Headquarters on the 16th. The cadres and staff of the Army Headquarters, except for a portion who have been ordered to transfer to Chongqing, will remain at the Reorganization Committee to work. Only a small number of personnel need to be disbanded and transferred. Since General He Yingqin expressed his willingness to retire as a member of the Strategic Advisory Committee to set an example for the national defense army, it is estimated that more than ten generals from various places who have not reached the retirement age have volunteered to resign from their military positions in order to be called upon to join the Strategic Advisory Committee. It is heard that General Cheng Qian, the current Director of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, is also among them. It is believed that once the unity is successful and the unification is completed, the lineup of China's national defense army will be even stronger.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin told foreign journalists tonight that he will resign on or before June 1st, and in the future, he will engage in "lighter work" and serve as a member of the Strategic Advisory Committee. The other members are war zone commanders and other senior generals who have not reached retirement age. His retirement age is 62. The committee is a small group and may include Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters, Yan Xishan, Commander of the Second War Zone, and Cheng Qian, Director of the Hankou Provisional Headquarters. If Yan Xishan serves as a member, he does not need to give up his position as Chairman of Shanxi Province.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief He Reports on the Implementation of Tasks</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin reported on the following major points at the National Government Memorial Week:</p>
<p>First, the situation of the Chinese Army Headquarters carrying out its missions after the Japanese surrender. On August 18, 34th year, it received the order of the Supreme Commander, which stipulates twelve articles of the Chinese Army Headquarters' missions. The implementation of each mission is reported separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Under the command of the Chairman, handle all matters related to the surrender of all enemy troops in the China Theater." The China Theater (excluding Cambodia) includes Taiwan, Penghu, and northern Vietnam. The enemy troops totaled thirty-three infantry divisions, one tank division, two air divisions, forty independent brigades, one independent cavalry brigade, nineteen independent garrison units (equivalent to independent brigades), and six naval special base units, totaling 1.3 million people. All had already been disarmed.</p>
<p>(2) "Instruct the implementation of matters by various war zones and armies." Because the enemy's distribution area in the China Theater was very wide and traffic was difficult, in order to quickly disarm the enemy and easily concentrate and manage them, it was divided into sixteen surrender zones, and sixteen surrender officers were assigned to prescribe all surrender procedures. Regarding the surrender of weapons, the remaining prisoners of war, and all military receipts, it was able to complete the task in an orderly and smooth manner.</p>
<p>(3) "According to the will of the Chairman, issue all orders to the supreme commander of the enemy forces in the China Theater." After receiving the order, I followed it, and before September 8, 34th year, before the enemy's Commander-in-Chief Yasuji Okamura signed the surrender, I notified Okamura with a memorandum to prescribe all procedures so that he could make various preparations for the surrender. On September 9th, after Okamura signed the surrender, the headquarters issued Military Order No. 1 to Okamura, stipulating that from 9:00 AM that day, I would completely change my use of orders and instructions to Okamura. All memos before 9:00 AM on the 9th would be treated as orders. All China Headquarters</p>
<p>(excluding the three northeastern provinces) Taiwan, Penghu, and the Japanese army, navy, and air force in northern Vietnam, completely accepted my control and command, and were not subject to any constraints from the Japanese government, and the title of "Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army" of Yasuji Okamura of Japan was cancelled, allowing him to remain in Nanjing, specializing in transmitting and implementing my orders.</p>
<p>(4) "According to the instructions of the Chairman, closely cooperate with the American military personnel in the China Theater to handle the disposition of enemy troops in the areas occupied by the American military and the areas jointly controlled by the Allied forces after they surrendered." Regarding cooperation with the American military, the first task was to airlift troops to Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and ship troops to Taiwan. The second was for the American amphibious forces to land in Qingdao, Tianjin, and Qinhuangdao to assist the national army in accepting surrender and repatriating prisoners of war. The third was to repatriate prisoners of war and Japanese nationals in the China Theater (excluding the three northeastern provinces), totaling 2,039,974 people, who were repatriated to Japan from twelve ports. As of May 5th of this year, 1,631,436 people have been repatriated to Japan, and the remaining 408,538 people are being repatriated. It is expected that they can be completely repatriated to Japan before June 30th. . "The matter of refugee relief and the restoration of transportation, communication, and transportation in the recovered area." Refugee relief is handled by the Relief Administration, and I have no right to command it. Regarding the restoration of traffic, communication, and transportation, south of the Longhai Line, all those that required military assistance to be restored have been completed and are now open. However, the eastern section of the Longhai Line (i.e., the Xuzhou-Haizhou section) was cut off again by the Communist army after it was restored and is still not open. As for North China and the Northeast, all places reached by the national army have been restored. Although they have been disturbed and destroyed by the Communist army, and they are sometimes open and sometimes blocked, the traffic within the scope of the national army can still be maintained.</p>
<p>(6) Guiding various war zones and sub-regions to handle the acceptance of the surrender of puppet troops, their disbandment, and the suppression of puppet troops who disobey orders in stages and regions. At the time of surrender, the total number of puppet troops was more than 683,000, all of whom surrendered to the government. As of now, more than 432,000 people have been disbanded. Except for Hao Pengju, the bogus Governor of Huaihai Province, who rebelled and surrendered to the Communist Party after surrendering because he refused to disband his bogus troops, the rest did not disobey orders. (7) Being responsible for quickly disposing of the Nanjing puppet organization government, restoring order in Nanjing and its vicinity, and waiting for the National Government to return to the capital. When I accepted the surrender in Nanjing on September 9th last year, only five companies of the New Sixth Army were transported to Nanjing. At that time, there were 70,000 enemy troops in the urban area, more than 10,000 puppet troops in the city, and the area ten kilometers outside the city was a bandit-infested area. At that time, I rushed to transport troops, disposed of enemy and puppet troops, cleared the remnants of the puppet organization, and drove away bandits. I ordered a large number of Japanese prisoners of war to participate in cleaning the city and building roads. By the time the government returned to the capital on May 5th, this task had been fully accomplished. The security of the capital is now very solid. I can responsibly say that there is absolutely no concern about insecurity near the capital in the future.</p>
<p>(8) "During the period of accepting the surrender of the enemy forces, according to the instructions of the Chairman, mobilize troops to occupy various military, political, economic, and transportation strongholds and key ports in the China Theater to form a favorable posture for collecting enemy weapons." Since receiving the surrender, Guangzhou, Changsha, Wuhan, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Anqing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Qingdao, Jinan, Beiping, Baoding. Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Shanhaiguan, GuiSui, Baotou, Datong, Taiyuan have been quickly occupied, only Gubeikou, Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Chifeng. Duolun, due to encountering special obstacles, failed to reach.</p>
<p>(9) "For any surrender forces not designated by the government who accept the surrender of enemy forces without authorization and attempt to disrupt our surrender plan, they may be submitted to the Chairman for punishment." Since the surrender, although the Communist army in various places in North China has repeatedly disobeyed orders and attempted to accept the surrender of a few parts of the enemy army, they have not been able to do so, so I have not submitted to the Chairman to take action.</p>
<p>(10) "Enemy forces that surrender to the troops designated by the Chairman, if they do not implement our military orders, may be ordered by the Army Headquarters to use force to punish them, and the enemy commander or enemy commander who does not obey the orders may be directly dealt with." With the virtue of Chairman Chiang, all Japanese troops strictly followed my orders during the surrender period, and no facts of disobeying orders have occurred.</p>
<p>(11) "Supervise and may handle all party and government affairs in the recovered area." According to this task, the Army Headquarters established a Committee for Receiving Party and Government in Recovered Areas in Zhijiang, which was composed of members from the Headquarters and the Executive Yuan. The method of handling affairs was to collect various books from the enemy and puppet parties, reorganize and analyze them, and then, according to their nature, order Yasuji Okamura and the Japanese military commanders in various places to designate a certain cause to maintain the status quo and hand it over to the receiving personnel sent by our government ministries and departments on a certain day. However, this method was later changed by order and could not be implemented. Therefore, after the Army Headquarters arrived in Nanjing, it only ordered Yasuji Okamura to follow the transfer according to the orders held by the receiving personnel of each receiving personnel to receive which cause.</p>
<p>(12) "Command all troops in each war zone advancing into the recovered area and the original troops in the recovered area, but the troops left behind in each war zone are still under the command of each war zone under the instructions of this committee (Military Affairs Committee)." I respectfully complied, but due to factual needs, I also received an order from the Chairman to place all the land forces in the country except those stationed in Sichuan and Kang under my command. The General Logistics Headquarters and the naval fleet were also temporarily placed under my command until now. The Army Headquarters was originally the highest command organ of the field army during the war. Now that the National Government has returned to the capital, there is no need for the existence of the Army Headquarters, so I have already submitted a request to abolish the Army Headquarters. Second, "The Reorganization of the Central Military Agency." I have served as the Minister of Military Administration for 14 and a half years, the Chief of the General Staff for 8 years, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army for one and a half years. I deeply feel that my central military agency is too large and complicated. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, my supreme commander is determined to establish the most advanced military system, abolish the Military Affairs Committee, and reorganize the Ministry of National Defense. Under the Ministry of National Defense, a General Staff Headquarters is established, on the one hand, to simplify and streamline the central military agency in the future, and on the other hand, to include the Ministry of National Defense in the Executive Yuan, making the Minister of National Defense a member of the cabinet. At the same time, the supreme commander's command power is directly transmitted through the Chief of the General Staff, and the national army, navy, and air force are ordered. This system is very reasonable, and all my military personnel wholeheartedly support it. The important positions of the General Staff Headquarters should also be filled with young military officers. For the placement of some veteran generals, first-level generals should retire at the age of sixty-two, second-level generals should retire at the age of sixty, and lieutenant generals should retire at the age of fifty-six. Those who have not reached the active service age, but have served in important military positions, have excellent academic knowledge, and have outstanding honors, whether they are army, navy, or air force generals, can be selected as members of the Strategic Advisory Committee. This committee is directly under the head of state and studies various issues related to national defense and strategy in peacetime, and serves as senior commanders in wartime.</p>
<p>Third, "Regarding the Nanjing Housing Issue" (omitted).</p>
<h3>UNRRA Far East Committee Meeting to Be Held in Nanjing at the Beginning of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] UNRRA Director-General Jiang Tingfu gave a press conference at 3:00 PM on the 13th. Answering reporters' questions, 1. Asked what the results of Hoover's visit to China were? Answer: Hoover is very sympathetic to China and admits that China's transportation capacity is sufficient to transport 200,000 tons of grain to the whole country every month. 2. Asked if there is a shortage of food in the Northeast? Answer: The Northeast lacks the most medicines and clothing, and the food situation is relatively good, but UNRRA is still transporting a considerable amount of food there. 3. Asked what are the transportation tools of UNRRA? Answer: UNRRA has 1,000 ships, including 700 tugs and barges, and 300 small naval boats, all of which are suitable for inland waterway transportation. However, these ships are too small to cross the Pacific Ocean from the United States to China. UNRRA has now signed a contract with an American shipping company to transport these ships to China. The most difficult thing is that China lacks sailors and has no experience in driving these small gasoline-powered ships. 4. Asked about the progress of the levee repair and breach closing project for the Yellow River's return to its old course? Answer: There are now 158,000 people engaged in this work, and UNRRA provides food. According to the CCP report, the old riverbed has been reclaimed. If it returns to its old course, hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs. UNRRA has considered providing relief for this. 5. Asked if the location of the next UNRRA Far East Regional Committee meeting has been decided? Answer: It has been decided to be held at the Public Rest Society in our capital on June 7th. UNRRA will send a special plane before the meeting to invite representatives from various countries to inspect the disaster situation in various parts of China.</p>

<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Resisting Military Grain Levy Submitted to Province for Instructions</p>
<p>Lu Dingyuan, a big landlord in Dangkou District, Jin'e Township of this county, resisted the military grain levy because he was rich and unkind.

<p>Military Grain Storage Loses Weight</p>

Now, the purchased military grain, when moved into the warehouse, weighs only 90%, causing public uproar and affecting the purchase. County Magistrate Fang sent a special telegram to the province requesting instructions on the handling policy.

<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Regulating the Purchase Price of Spring Cocoons</p>
<p>The silkworm affairs in the four townships of Jiaxing are nearing the major sleep stage. Due to weather conditions, the silkworms are not developing well, causing the silkworm varieties to fade. It is expected that the silkworm harvest will be of medium quality. The cocoon merchants are preparing to collect cocoons, and several factories have been destroyed by the enemy and puppets, making it difficult to repair them in a short time. In addition, several factories are hesitant due to their remote location and the recent frequent bandit alarms. They are currently requesting the authorities to send a team to defend the cocoon market when the time comes. As for the price of fresh cocoons, the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Association has decided that the price of fresh cocoons must not be lower than 100,000 yuan per zu. The cocoon industry association of this county will also convene a meeting in the coming days to discuss everything. Zhejiang Province Approves and Announces the Purchase Price of Spring Cocoons; Because the feeding of spring silkworms in various counties of Zhejiang Province is enthusiastic this year, new cocoons will be available in Xin'an, Shengxian, and other counties in eastern Zhejiang in the coming days. The China Silk Company has decided to allocate a cocoon purchase loan of 10 billion yuan. Southern Anhui, due to limited production, is assigned to the Zhejiang region for handling. In order to expedite the loan disbursement, it has been approved that the Zhejiang China Bank will allocate 2 billion yuan, of which 500 million yuan will first be loaned to Zhuji, Xinchang, Shengxian, and other places on the 10th, and the remaining amount is still being loaned. As for the standard price of spring cocoons, the provincial government has approved and announced it, calculated based on reeling, ranging from 95,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan per 100 market pounds, with the central price being 100,000 yuan. The Municipal Government Forbids the Operation of Dance Halls; The Hangzhou Municipal Government intends to ban the operation of dance halls from the end of May. It is said that the education authorities will also prohibit students from participating in dancing to avoid neglecting their studies. The British Dominions prime ministers held an Imperial Conference in London at the end of last month to discuss Pacific defense issues. In principle, it had been decided to convene a Pacific Nations Conference to establish a defense structure in the South and Southwest Pacific to resist possible aggression. However, because Canadian Prime Minister King arrived late, the Imperial Conference had to adjourn temporarily, waiting for King to arrive in England before reconvening to thoroughly resolve the issue and send Australian Prime Minister Chifley to Washington to discuss the issue of the United States setting up defense bases in the Pacific. In the United States, after the war, the situation in the Pacific appeared outwardly relaxed but internally strong, and attention was particularly paid to the issue of setting up defense bases in the Pacific. Army Chief of Staff General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower even traveled across the ocean, visiting the Pacific region in person and taking the opportunity to visit our country's highest leader, President Chiang Kai-shek, and Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, commander of the British Pacific Fleet inspecting the Far East, to discuss the major plan for Pacific defense. This further shows the importance of this issue, and our country has a direct interest and cannot be taken lightly. The Guangdong Provincial Assembly recently held a meeting and passed a resolution requesting the Central Government to negotiate with Britain to recover Hong Kong, stating that "Hong Kong and Kowloon are important coastal areas of Guangdong Province, and are of great importance to politics, economics, and national defense. They should be re-incorporated into China's territory. It has been decided to telegraph the Central Government to promptly negotiate with the British government to recover them to maintain territorial sovereignty and consolidate national defense." Therefore, the Hong Kong issue has once again become a problem of concern to the people in the midst of Pacific defense talk.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is our country's territory, ceded to Britain after the Opium War in 1842, and has been so for over a hundred years, but our compatriots still account for 80% of the residents of Hong Kong. Therefore, when Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang met in Cairo, they discussed the long-term plan for the Far East and agreed in principle to return Hong Kong to China. President Roosevelt, in his report on the Cairo Conference after returning to the United States, also said: "Regarding the Cairo Conference, the long-term plan for the Far East was discussed. The Far East will soon be rebuilt, and there are three principles: (1) to return property to its original owners; (2) to recognize the right of the people of the Far East to establish autonomous governments, without interference; and (3) the permanent elimination of the Japanese Empire is a prerequisite for maintaining peace in the Pacific and the world." From this, it can be seen that in the eyes of the great political diplomats of the United States, Hong Kong should be returned to China, without any question. When the war ended, our government should have negotiated with Britain for its return, but unfortunately, the situation in the Northeast changed, and the Communist Party attempted to occupy the Northeast. The withdrawal of Soviet troops was repeatedly delayed, making the nine provinces of the Northeast another complex diplomatic vortex. Therefore, diplomacy with the Soviet Union had to be considered the most urgent task, without time to attend to other matters, and the Hong Kong issue was put on hold. However, our people are still very concerned about this issue, especially paying attention to the British side's dynamics on this issue. The visit of Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser, commander of the British Pacific Fleet, to China, and his meeting with General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, in Japan, are even more the focus of our attention. Admiral Fraser once told the press in Shanghai that Hong Kong would remain a British naval base, which has caused dissatisfaction in our country's public opinion; when he arrived in Tokyo, he told a French news agency reporter that "China is willing for British troops to be stationed in Hong Kong." Our newspaper's special correspondent, fearing that this statement might be a false rumor, made a special trip to visit him, but Fraser said: "The situation in China is extremely chaotic, and in any case, they are still barbarians" (see the first page of our newspaper on May 12). As the commander-in-chief of the navy, such an inappropriate statement is regrettable, and we cannot but take it as a pity. In order to maintain friendly relations between the two countries, we cannot but refute Fraser's incoherent words. Although the British political scene after the war has been succeeded by the Labour Party, advocating socialism, in diplomacy, it still does not shed the style of the Conservative Party era, exposing the ferocious faces of imperialists everywhere. It even disregards the promises made during the war and the combat goals it proclaimed, and pursues its own self-interest. The Eight Points of the Atlantic Charter have long been thrown into the clouds. For example, on the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue, Britain not only has no intention of returning them to China, but also harbors great ambitions, having attempted to build a large-scale airfield in Ping Shan, Kowloon, to consolidate Hong Kong's position in the North Pacific. However, after repeated protests from our people, this plan was abandoned. This retrograde measure only shows that its efforts are becoming increasingly futile. Britain must know that the recovery of Hong Kong is the "national aspiration" of the Chinese people, and no one can go against it.</p>
<p>When discussing the Hong Kong issue, the scene of the fall of Hong Kong on December 25, 1941, is still vividly in our minds. The Hong Kong battle lasted less than two weeks, and the British army could not resist, surrendering with their hands tied. 11,000 officers and soldiers were captured, which is the most dishonorable page in modern British history. According to military experts, the main reason why the British army could not defend Hong Kong for long was that the British army failed to hold Kowloon until the Chinese army arrived to jointly defend Hong Kong. This historical recollection greatly helps Britain understand the position of Hong Kong. Britain is far away from Hong Kong by thousands of miles, and once something happens, it will be impossible to protect it in any way. It was so before the war, and it will be so in the future. Moreover, the situation in the Pacific after the war has undergone tremendous changes. No matter which perspective you look from, Britain has no need to maintain Hong Kong as a naval base for any country.</p>
<p>Britain's return of Hong Kong to China is, in theory, the proper thing to do. Even emotionally, the British people cannot but regard the abandonment of Hong Kong as a symbol of the decline of the British Empire, or may inevitably cause the die-hards to sigh with emotion, unable to let go, but the rulers should broaden their horizons, face reality, and understand the domestic and international situation. Recently, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee allowed India to become independent on the one hand, and announced the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt on the other. The British Labour Party government does have a new trend, earning praise from all over the world. We deeply hope that the British authorities can also take enlightened measures on the Hong Kong issue.</p>

<h3>Tokyo Trials of Japanese War Criminals; Kiyose Attempts to Limit Court Authority; Prosecutor Sternly Refutes; General Sun Liren Attends Hearing in Tokyo</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 13th] Well-informed sources say that the Japanese war criminal defense lawyers requested General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to establish a defense group under the MacArthur Headquarters, like the prosecution group under the MacArthur Headquarters. MacArthur, after hearing this request, rejected it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tokyo, 13th] The International Military Tribunal continued its trial work today. Yosuke Matsuoka, who opposed the League of Nations and signed the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact, was also among those on trial, but was unable to attend due to illness. General Sun Liren, commander of the New First Army, passed through Tokyo and also attended the hearing this morning. Most journalists were very familiar with this hero of the Burma campaign. General Sun sat in the honorary seat, his eyes constantly fixed on the twenty-six Japanese defendants. Kiyose, the chief Japanese defense lawyer, argued with the nine judges for two hours. Kiyose pointed out that after the "Manchurian Incident," the Soviet government recognized "Manchukuo," because the Soviet side sold the Chinese Eastern Railway to the "Manchukuo government," so the Manchurian aspect must not be within the scope of the trial. The Soviet assistant prosecutor handed a note to Chief Prosecutor Keenan. Keenan immediately stood up to stop Kiyose's argument and said to Chief Justice Webb: "The court does not allow Kiyose to argue in this way." Webb said: "Continue speaking." Keenan said: "Japanese defense lawyers must list the facts." Webb then ordered the Japanese defense lawyers to argue based on the facts. Kiyose said: "I understand," but continued to raise several questions related to the Soviet Union. He said: Japan and the Soviet Union have a neutral relationship, so there is no need to fight. Keenan stood up again, requesting Webb to stop this kind of debate, because it has exceeded the scope of the facts. After that, Kiyose stopped the unnecessary debate, and the court rested for fifteen minutes. When the court reopened, Keenan immediately stood up and delivered a speech, opposing any attempt by the defendants to limit the authority of the court and not to distort the true meaning of the Potsdam Declaration. He firmly insisted that all war criminals must be given a fair trial, including the Japanese who abused Allied prisoners of war. He did not admit that Japan's surrender was subject to any conditions. At 4:50, the debate was temporarily adjourned, and the presiding judge announced that the debate would continue at 9:30 tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th Special Dispatch] Today, Ichiro Kiyose, Tojo's defense lawyer, submitted an application on behalf of all the Japanese defense lawyers, questioning the scope of war crimes and the issue of its jurisdiction prescribed by the International Military Tribunal this morning. Kiyose Ichiro firmly stated that Japan's occupation of the Northeast does not fall within the scope of the Pacific War or the "Greater East Asia War." He pointed out that the "Manchurian Incident," which created "Manchukuo," was tacitly approved by the Soviet Union. Tojo's lawyer directly told the Soviet judge that Soviet Russia sold the Chinese Eastern Railway to "Manchukuo," which meant that the Soviet Union recognized the existence of the Manchurian puppet state. Kiyose Ichiro pointed out that the Changkufeng Incident in 1938 and the Nomonhan Incident in 1939 had been resolved by agreements signed by the Soviet and Japanese governments. Keenan stopped his debate, opposing "this method of debate." Judge Webb told Kiyose not to make arguments that violate the facts. Kiyose continued to point out that due to violations of the agreement, the Changkufeng and Nomonhan incidents have been resolved, so the accusations in Articles 51 and 52 based on the two incidents should be withdrawn from the complaint. Keenan immediately stood up and declared: The Soviet prosecutor "denies that the defendant's lawyer's statement regarding the Changkufeng incident is true." Kiyose continued to demand that he be allowed to present evidence to prove his statement.</p>
<h3>Kiyose's Crafty Defense: A Distorted Interpretation of the Potsdam Declaration</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] In today's session of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Kiyose Ichiro, the white-haired defense counsel for Tojo, representing the twenty-eight Japanese defendants, loudly accused the United Nations of indicting former Japanese leaders for crimes against peace and humanity, claiming it was "beyond the scope of international law."</p>
<h3>A Delusional Attempt to Exonerate</h3>
<p>When Kiyose began to question the court's jurisdiction, he declared: "The Potsdam Declaration not only binds Japan but also the United Nations." According to the Potsdam Agreement, the United Nations was only permitted to prosecute war criminals who violated established laws and war customs, and it did not include new items listed in the indictment, such as holding the defendants responsible for inciting war and abusing the people of the United Nations. "Japan's surrender is very different from Germany's surrender. Germany resisted to the end and finally collapsed. This was unconditional surrender." The Potsdam Declaration stipulated the conditions for Japan's armistice, "This is a kind of proposal," but as such, it was accepted, and as such, the United Nations must abide by it. The United Nations could punish war criminals in the Nuremberg Tribunal without trial, because Germany surrendered unconditionally. The United Nations' indictment against the Japanese defendants exceeds existing international law. No international code in the world mentions planning war as a war crime. Kiyose also cited several sections of the British War Code, proving that war crimes are specifically defined as four types: violations of military rights by non-combatants, looting, espionage, and sabotage. He also stated that until July 1945, various existing laws, regardless of the nature of the war, could not consider planning, initiating, and executing war as a violation of peace. Kiyose said: Although the Potsdam Declaration has provisions for strict laws, "We Japanese never expected that the declaration would extend to crimes against peace and bring charges against important politicians, diplomats, and other important figures in Japan." When Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, it only knew that the punishment of war criminals should be based on the existing international law.</p>
<p>The trial is progressing very slowly due to language barriers. Kiyose speaks English fluently but speaks in Japanese, but he often corrects the translator's mistakes to ensure the meaning is correct.</p>
<p>Kiyose then mentioned that Japan and the Soviet Union had signed an agreement in 1938 to resolve the undeclared war over Changkufeng and settle border disputes. Soviet Judge Zaryanov objected, and Presiding Judge Webb ordered Kiyose's remarks to be removed from the record. Kiyose also requested that the charges against Thailand be dropped because "Thailand is not a member of the United Nations, neither in the past nor now," so the court has no jurisdiction to act on its behalf. He also said: It is surprising that the person accused of the various charges related to Thailand was in Tokyo and not in Thailand at the time of the incident.</p>
<h3>The Court Surrounded by Heavy Barbed Wire</h3>
<p>Of the twenty-eight Japanese war criminal defendants, only twenty-six were present today. The two absent were Okawa Shumei, who acted abnormally in the second trial and is undergoing psychiatric examination, and former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke, who is also undergoing medical examination. The Army Ministry building where the courtroom is located is now surrounded by a circle of high barbed wire, a new security measure. Military police continue to guard all entrances and exits and search all United Nations and Japanese spectators.</p>
<h3>Hunchback Without Hump in the Imperial Secret Zoo</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] The serious food situation in Japan has caused the Mongolian camels in the Imperial Zoo to almost lose their humps. The humps of these tall animals are now shrinking and drooping. The park manager believes this is due to replacing their original food of oatmeal with sweet potato peels obtained from the US Army kitchen.</p>
<h3>Judges Mostly Wearing Black Glasses</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] When the International Military Tribunal for the Far East opened today, seven of the nine judges were wearing black glasses to avoid the strong lights installed for photography. The only ones not wearing glasses were Massachusetts High Court Judge Higgins and Soviet Judge Zaryanov. The defendants were also affected by the glare. Sato wore black glasses, while Itagaki appeared to be dozing off. Only Nami Jiro wore sunglasses in the defendant's seat.</p>
<h3>The Trial Court Twice Warned the Defendant's Lawyer, Advising Him Not to Use Incendiary Language</h3>
<p>Today, the International Court heard arguments from Japanese defense lawyers regarding jurisdictional limits. Presiding Judge Webb twice cautioned the defendant's lawyer, first criticizing his use of embellished language and then warning him not to use inflammatory language to avoid prejudicing the court. Lee Nan asked the court to allow him to read excerpts from President Roosevelt's 1942 radio address, which proved that the United Nations had long wanted to legally punish Axis leaders and their accomplices for inciting war. After consulting with the judge, Ji Nan cited the words of Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill, and Chairman Chiang, and declared to the court that he could be trusted not to exceed the bounds of propriety? British Deputy Prosecutor Kerr was also unparalleled.</p>
<h3>Iranian Azerbaijan Representative Reopens Negotiations with the Government, Hope for Peaceful Resolution Gradually Increases, Government Troops Still Pouring into the Border</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 12th] According to sources close to the Iranian Prime Minister this evening, negotiations between the Azerbaijan Democratic Delegation and Iranian Prime Minister Sa'ed, which had been deadlocked for several days, have resumed today. It is said that the resumption of negotiations was at the request of the head of the Azerbaijan delegation, Bishi Vari. During the negotiations, Bishi withdrew the counter-proposal that had led to the breakdown of negotiations. Political figures believe tonight that a peaceful resolution is now more hopeful, but Monday's London morning papers cited a broadcast from the British Broadcasting Corporation, stating that Azerbaijan has "declared war on the central Iranian government." The broadcast also stated: "Our army is now marching towards Tehran." The daily briefing emphasized that the news of the declaration of war was initially reported by some quarters, but was later denied. Last Sunday evening, United Press reported from Tehran that negotiations had resumed, but did not mention news of war. [United Press, Tehran, 12th] Reliable Iranian government officials said today that although the British Broadcasting Corporation announced that the people of Azerbaijan are "prepared for war," a civil war in Iran is unlikely to occur for the time being, or may even be averted. Azerbaijan Prime Minister Bishi Vari had originally arrived at the Tehran airport yesterday to prepare to return to Great Britain, but was unable to do so due to bad weather. He then met with Central Government Prime Minister Sa'ed, expressing his willingness to reopen negotiations based on the government's proposal. The government's proposal stipulates that Azerbaijan return to the jurisdiction of the central government, but retain certain autonomous rights. Bishi Vari is reportedly prepared to withdraw certain points of the counter-proposal he made to facilitate progress and reach an agreement soon.</p>
<p>Tehran Radio broadcast a denial of a report by a news agency that Sa'ed was willing to use force to resolve the Azerbaijan issue. However, the tense situation in Iran in recent days and the continuous flow of reinforcements to the Kurdistan border are true. An army officer also admitted yesterday that a large number of munitions and some soldiers were transported to support the Chalfagari and Afshar tribes loyal to the central government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 13th] One person estimated that if the Iranian government took military action against Azerbaijan, the number of troops it could mobilize would not exceed 10,000, which is less than the strength of the Azerbaijan Democratic Army.</p>
<h3>Arab Groups Seek Assistance from the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Requesting that the Palestine Issue</p>
<p>Be Submitted to the Security Council for Discussion</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 13th] According to reliable sources: The Arab Higher Committee has urged the Soviet Union to submit the Palestine issue to the United Nations Security Council, and declared that the "oppression" imposed by democratic countries is worse than the "aggressive warmongering" of the Nazis and Fascists.</p>
<h3>Implementing Economic Boycott Against Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 12th] Secretary-General of the Arab Higher Committee, Husseini, recently sent a telegram to the Prime Ministers of Syria and Lebanon, requesting an economic boycott of Britain and the United States, and said, "Before the Arab Conference (to be held near Damascus on the 18th) resolves the issue, please do not grant economic benefits to Britain and the United States."</p>
<h3>Jewish Secret Party Warns Britain</h3>

The Jewish Resistance Movement is determined to obstruct Britain's efforts to make Palestine its military camp.</p>
<h3>The Impact of the Japanese People's Intrusion into the Imperial Palace Spreads Throughout the Country, Police Authorities Issue a Warning, Demonstrators Will Arrive One After Another</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 13th] The intrusion of a group of people demanding food and political leadership into the sacred grounds of the Emperor's Palace, the supreme authority in Japan, yesterday is unprecedented in Japanese history. (See yesterday's Japanese newspaper for details) In the history of Japan's entire food crisis and political instability, no crowd has ever dared to break into the Imperial Palace grounds, at most submitting petitions through government offices. The most reckless intrusion into the Imperial Palace grounds occurred on the night of August 15, 1945, when several stubborn military officers broke through the gate and rushed into the Imperial Household Ministry to search for the recording of the Emperor's surrender edict, intending to take it away. The impact of yesterday's incident has spread throughout the country, but the Japanese do not consider this act disrespectful to the Imperial Family. If it had happened a few months ago, the reaction would have been strong. This factor seems to be a symbol of the new relationship between the Emperor and the people. It is reported that the Police Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued a warning, saying that the people of Japan are increasingly uneasy about the current political crisis that has not been resolved for a long time, and it is expected that a large number of demonstrators will arrive one after another.</p>
<h3>British Labour Party Chairman Advocates Cooperation with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] British Labour Party Chairman Laski, in a speech in Cardiff, said: The British Labour Party knows the necessity of maintaining a strong friendship with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union should also tell us the scope of its demands. If it is said that we must choose between the United States and the Soviet Union, I will answer that we do not need to choose. The Labour Party supports the Soviet Union one hundred percent.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Continues, Striving for Agreement, Bevin Returns to Paris from London Yesterday, Possible Compromise on the Ruhr Question</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 13th] After a one-day break, the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference continued today, striving to resolve the points on which no agreement has yet been reached, and the French proposal to separate the Ruhr armaments zone from Germany seems to have a possibility of compromise. French sources said that the British recently suggested adopting a joint system in the Ruhr region, even including part of the Rhineland. This approach may lead to a compromise. In addition, important issues such as the Italian treaty seem to be resolvable through compromise, except for the Trieste issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned to England at the end of last week to report to Prime Minister Attlee, and flew here at 7:30 pm (Shanghai time) today in order to proceed with the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. Bevin did not make a statement when he left London. It is widely believed that Bevin's sudden return to England was because Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov agreed to change his attitude towards the Italian treaty in the Friday night and Saturday meetings, so he needed to consult with the British Prime Minister on the possible change in Britain's position on this issue. The London Observer now believes that the success or failure of the Paris Conference may be decided early this week.</p>

General de Gaulle did not participate in this ceremony, but went to the statue of "Tiger Prime Minister" Clemenceau, who was prime minister before the last war, to lay a wreath and deliver a speech, saying: France must obtain a hero of the moment to relieve it when it encounters a crisis.

<p>[United Press, Alexandria, 12th] Italian King Victor Emmanuel III, accompanied by Queen Helen, who had been exiled here, disembarked here today from an Italian cruiser and went to the palace of Egyptian King Farouk for temporary residence. The short-statured Victor Emmanuel was welcomed by Farouk, who stepped forward to greet him, but did not accompany him to the Antoniades Palace. There were police guards along the route from the pier to the palace, but the streets were almost deserted. Recalling the grand welcome with tens of thousands of people lining the streets when the King and Queen visited Egypt in 1933, I am overwhelmed by the feelings of the past and present. This time, the King and his party took a sedan escorted by police on motorized bicycles to the palace. When the King left the ship, he said to all the crew members: "I bid farewell to you, you are the people I have loved all my life!"</p>

<h3>Morrison Arrives in the US to Negotiate, Intensifying the Anti-Famine Struggle, Hoover Arrives in Washington on the Same Day to Report to the President, the US May Restore Food Rationing</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 13th] British Privy Council member Morrison flew here from London yesterday. After getting off the plane, he told reporters that only by taking various powerful measures can the famine be saved. He also said that his visit was to negotiate with President Truman on how to prevent the goal of the Five Powers struggling to the end from being affected by the global famine. We defeated Nazi Germany and Japan. I don't believe we can't win the anti-famine struggle that can control the fate of the world. But at this moment, it is undeniable that this battle is unfavorable to us. Famine can kill countless civilians and spread the germs of fascism more quickly than Hitler and Mussolini could. Morrison added that the Indian issue was certainly within the scope of his discussion. In addition, a London correspondent for the World Post learned from a senior authority that Morrison will ask President Truman to implement meat and fat consumption restrictions in the United States.</p>
<p>At the same time, Hoover, chairman of the Relief Committee, has returned here after a 35,000-mile world food inspection. He will meet with Agriculture Secretary Anderson and report the results of his trip to President Truman today.</p>

Paul guides government economic agencies such as the Management Bureau, the Wage Adjustment Board, and other similar agencies, and is one of Truman's key advisors. According to Paul's friends, he has made arrangements for the restoration of the food rationing system, which can be implemented once needed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Governor-General Wavell's direct appeal to President Truman for more food for India and the urgent flight of British Privy Council member Morrison to Washington to hold talks with the US President have now focused world attention on the severe food situation encountered in India and Eurasia. Britain has now reduced food rations by 10%, and former UNRRA Director Lehman has also appealed to Washington to restore food rationing in the United States and double the amount of food shipped to famine areas.</p>
<h3>British and American Food Committees are Declared Established</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] The State Department issued a communique today stating that the British-American Rice Committee has been established on the date of the publication of the British-American Siam Agreement. The purpose of the committee is to increase the amount of Siamese rice exports. The British previously signed an agreement with Siam, stipulating that Siam would provide surplus rice to countries designated by Britain at no cost. The United States believes that this is most likely to hinder China and India from obtaining the urgently needed Siamese rice as soon as possible. This provision has been declared canceled in the agreement.</p>

<h3>British Delegation Returns to New Delhi Today, Visit to India Not Concluded, Viceroy Considers Establishing Provisional Government, Announcement to be Made on Breakdown of Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Simla, 12th Dispatch] The Indian Independence Round Table Conference was formally declared broken after meeting for one hour today. Given this situation, there will inevitably be a major reaction nationwide, which may not only cause hatred between Hindu and Muslim Indians, but may also cause hatred between British and Indian people. According to the British Cabinet Delegation, a statement will be issued within days, indicating the steps to be taken thereafter. Many Indians originally hoped that British rule would be quickly transferred to Indian self-rule. The breakdown of this conference is a major blow. According to a joint communique, after considering the proposals put forward by the Muslim League and the Congress Party, it was deemed that further discussions would be fruitless and that the conference should be declared closed. The British Cabinet Delegation solemnly stated that both sides had made every effort to find a solution, and therefore neither side was to blame for the breakdown of the conference. The letters exchanged between the two sides during the conference will be published within days. The second joint communique issued by the British Cabinet Delegation and the Viceroy emphasized that although the conference has broken down, the mission has not ended, and announced that the delegation is scheduled to leave for New Delhi this Tuesday.</p>

<h3>Resolving the India-Egypt Events Concerns British Credibility</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cardiff, 13th Dispatch] Chairman of the British Labour Party, Laski, stated yesterday that India and Egypt are two major events related to the credibility of the Labour government. The issue of India is now about to be resolved, and from now on, we will no longer allow India to become a prison of the British Empire. As for the Egyptian event, the answer is very simple.

<p>[Wood Newspaper Report] London, 13th Broadcast: Canadian Prime Minister King arrived in New York today. He will board the British mail ship "Queen Mary" to London to attend the final stage of the Dominion Prime Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 13th Dispatch] Canada, Britain, and Newfoundland secretly signed an agreement on the defense of Newfoundland on April 8th. It was only announced a few days ago, and has subjected the cooperation between the United States and Canada in formulating North American defense work to the first severe shake-up since the outbreak of war seven years ago. The United States has defense bases in several locations on the island of Newfoundland, with a 99-year lease right, and has spent 200 million US dollars to construct defense projects. Therefore, the United States has long recognized that the main responsibility for defending Newfoundland lies with the US side, because the island's location controls air and sea routes in the North Atlantic and is essential for protecting North America from European attacks. The US had no knowledge of this treaty, which has caused considerable surprise among US officials. However, Washington officials say the new agreement does not change the US relationship with Canada or Newfoundland.</p>

<h3>President Soong Officially Announces Wu Kuo-cheng as Shanghai Mayor, Deputy Mayor Ho Teh-kwei Rumored to Succeed as Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Directors of Finance, Police, Education, and Health Bureaus Tender Resignations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] President of the Executive Yuan Soong Tzu-wen officially announced tonight that former Minister of Propaganda Wu Kuo-cheng has been appointed as the new Mayor of Shanghai. Soong will hold a press conference tomorrow to announce various new appointments.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Wu Kuo-cheng</p>
<p>Wu Kuo-cheng was born in October of the ninth year before the founding of the Republic of China in Sanli, a small town in Jianshi, Hubei. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, he graduated from Tsinghua School in Beijing. In the twelfth year, he graduated from Grinnell College in the United States with a bachelor's degree. In the thirteenth year, he obtained a master's degree from Princeton University in the United States. In the fifteenth year, he obtained a Ph.D. in political science from the same university.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, he served as Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, Chief of the Liaison Section of the Jiangsu Diplomatic Affairs Office, Deputy Director of the First Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Member of the Treaty Committee. In the seventeenth year, he served as the Director of the Hubei Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau. In the eighteenth year, he served as a Senior Advisor to the Wuhan Special Municipal Government, Director of the Land Bureau and Director of the Finance Bureau of the Hankou Special Municipal Government. Soon, Wu was promoted to Mayor of Hankou. At this time, Wu was only in his thirties, making him one of the youngest mayors in Chinese history. In addition to his astute and capable administrative skills, Wu also speaks fluent English. Madame Chiang Kai-shek once praised Wu in this way: "In China, I have never seen a returned student who can speak such good English!"</p>
<p>After Wu retreated from Wuhan to Chongqing, he soon became the Mayor of the capital. In the spring of the 28th year, Wu presented a request to President Chiang, who approved the organization of a special guard regiment and a mass self-defense force. Later, Wu was transferred to Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and in the 34th year, he was promoted to Minister of Propaganda, a position he has held until now. Wu's wife is Ms. Huang Mary, the daughter of Huang Kung-wei, the former Director of the Hanyang Arsenal.</p>
<h3>Bureau Directors Tender Resignations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to reliable sources: Mayor of this city, Chien Ta-chun, has submitted a request for resignation, which has been approved, and he will be appointed to another position. After Wu Kuo-cheng, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, succeeds him, the system of Deputy Mayor of the Municipal Government will be abolished. Shen Shih-hua will resign from the position of Secretary-General, to be succeeded by Deputy Mayor Ho Teh-kwei.</p>
<p>The bureau directors who have submitted resignations include: Director of the Finance Bureau Pu Cheng-tung, Director of the Police Bureau Hsuan Tieh-wu, Director of the Health Bureau Yu Sung-chun, Director of the Education Bureau Ku Yu-hsiu, and Director of the Land Bureau Chen Shih-chuan. In addition, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, the Director of the Personnel Department, the Chief of the Liaison Section, and the directors of the relevant offices will also tender their resignations.</p>
<p>The candidate for the Police Bureau Director, which is of greatest concern to all sectors of the city, is rumored to be Chen Hsi-tseng, Director of the General Affairs Bureau of the Civil Service Department of the National Government. It is also rumored that Li Shih-chen, Director of Academic Affairs of the Central Police Academy, or Yu Shu-ping, the current Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, may also succeed. Yu graduated from the Vienna Police Academy and also studied law at the University of Vienna, earning a Ph.D. After returning to China, he successively held important positions as a university professor and in the Central Party Headquarters' Examination Yuan, and is one of China's leading police experts.</p>
<h3>Director Pu Discusses Tax Revenue Issues, Housing Donation Rate Not Increased, Can Be Agreed Upon by Landlord and Tenant</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Pu Cheng-tung, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, is determined to resign and has submitted his resignation to Mayor Chien, requesting its approval by the Executive Yuan. Director Pu told reporters yesterday that at the beginning of the Finance Bureau's takeover, tax revenue was only over 60 million yuan. Since then, it has increased month by month, reaching over 3 billion yuan last month. There are also other taxes taken by the central government from the local government, totaling about 1.3 billion yuan. The total amount for this month should exceed 4.5 billion yuan. The bureau adheres to the principle of "preventing corruption and eliminating embezzlement" so that every penny paid by the people goes into the national treasury. It strictly manages the personnel of the entire bureau, and believes that all members of the bureau are honest and self-disciplined. As for whether there are any loopholes among tax investigators, this is unknown. However, the Finance Bureau's revenue and expenditure have precise and complex procedures. All cash revenue does not go through the hands of the bureau's personnel, but is handled by specialized institutions and directly paid to the municipal bank. Expenditure procedures are even more precise. The payment order must be stamped with the blue seals of the Mayor, Chief Accountant, Audit Office, and Finance Bureau before it can be paid. Regarding the method of collecting housing donations in this city, Director Pu believes that there is a need for improvement. Before the war, housing donations accounted for 60% of the income of the Public Works Bureau, while now most taxes are taken from entertainment, banquets, and other donations, which is not very reasonable. Every citizen should be jointly responsible for the municipal government's tax revenue. Therefore, he advocates that in the future, the number of housing donations should not be specified, and can be agreed upon by the landlord and tenant themselves. The municipal government's housing donation rate should also not be increased, and should still be collected at 14%. This will not only increase the municipal government's revenue, but also prevent second landlords from extorting gold bars, and large landlords will not be unwilling to build new houses because they lose ownership of the houses. If the municipal government's finances can be implemented in this way, then revenue will be abundant.</p>
<h3>Pharmaceuticals Made by the Health Bureau More Effective Than DDT, City's Epidemic Prevention Work Active</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yu Sung-chun, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, has handled the city's health facilities since taking office, paying attention to all aspects of work in an environment of lack of financial resources, materials, and manpower, and has achieved considerable success. In particular, the establishment of free hospital beds in various municipal hospitals and some private hospitals, as well as epidemic prevention work, have done his best. It is heard that Director Yu also intends to resign from his position in the Health Bureau. The reporter made a special visit yesterday, and Yu said that he had the intention to resign three months ago, and the handover procedures had been prepared long ago. He has now formally submitted his resignation to the Mayor. Director Yu said that he has always been cautious and self-disciplined in the past six months or so, which is his most gratifying point. Regarding the most urgent epidemic prevention work, he has actively planned to promote it, and will convene medical experts tomorrow to discuss the most effective implementation methods. The biggest source of epidemic transmission is unclean drinking water, especially in the Xuhui, Zhabei, and Xujiahui districts. Therefore, the inspection of water sources and disinfection work has been strengthened. Starting next week, the city will train the staff of various restaurants by district, alternately teaching them how to manage food in their spare time, and then hold competitions in stages. The trophy will be set up in the best restaurant to reward each winner. Because the Health Bureau's DDT inventory from the Executive Yuan is not enough to distribute, all of the bureau's DDT has been used up. Therefore, the bureau has made its own pharmaceuticals similar to DDT, which are specially used for long-term injections in dead rivers where mosquitoes and flies breed the most. The effect is stronger than DDT. In addition, the vaccines produced by the bureau are now sufficient for 2 million people, and not only can they be used for free injections for the citizens of this city, but also other cities have successively requested supplies.</p>

<h3>Gold Bars Can't Defeat It!</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Executive Yuan's Housing Allocation Committee for Various Shanghai Agencies held a group meeting at 3 PM yesterday to discuss and report on the progress of each group. The second batch of agencies whose application qualifications have been revoked was submitted, and preparations were made for review and reconsideration at the committee's weekly meeting tomorrow (the 15th). In addition, the committee decided to commend Shen Chih-chang, an investigator of the committee, for refusing a bribe of 100,000 yuan to encourage him. As for foreign real estate companies, a batch of companies such as Cheung Mao and Tilly have already submitted lists for review by the committee, and the committee will give them preferential treatment and allocate them for self-management as much as possible within the possible scope. However, several companies such as Sassoon and Kwong Yip have not yet submitted the lists. It is heard that the committee has limited them to submitting them within three days, otherwise the houses rented out by these real estate companies will be forcibly allocated. Also, the work of the various investigation groups of the Housing Allocation Committee has not been completed, and investigation reports have not yet been received.</p>

Yesterday morning, hundreds of worker representatives went to the General Labor Union, the Social Affairs Bureau, and other agencies to petition, demanding the release of 14 arrested workers. The General Labor Union agreed to take responsibility for the negotiations, but representatives from both labor and management did not meet throughout the day, and negotiations could not begin. As a result, all tailoring shops in the city were forced to close down yesterday. Regarding the fact that the Garrison Headquarters convened representatives from both sides for a final negotiation at 6 PM this afternoon, the labor side said that it was verbally informed by a responsible person from the headquarters, but the management side said that it had not yet received a notice from the relevant parties. Once the notice arrives, they will gladly accept mediation and participate in the negotiations. The reporter visited the responsible persons of both labor and management separately yesterday, referring to the current preconditions as compensation for the damage and the release of the arrested workers. The new clothes that were splashed with ink at Peiromon Tailors on Nanjing Road included a summer suit from Lee &amp; Lan. The total loss of tailoring shops in the city is more than 100 million yuan. The fourteen workers involved in the incident have been transferred to the Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<p>The employers' association published a notice in the newspapers yesterday, detailing the history of wage increases. It also stated that the workers' irregular actions have caused significant losses to various shops, and they have been forced to close down. They appealed to all sectors to uphold justice.</p>
<p>The labor side said that labor-management negotiations have been delayed for months, and the management side has been delaying. The workers were forced to endure it for their livelihoods and could no longer bear it. Therefore, some workers were motivated by righteous indignation and took irregular actions, which will be stopped in the future. However, they hope that the problem will be resolved as soon as possible, and the workers cannot wait any longer.</p>
<p>Also, a person in charge of the management side said that the average wage in this industry is better than in other industries, but the workers still use force to threaten and commit acts of violence and destruction. The management side has been forced to make concessions more than once. The cost of living in April was low, but the management side sought to pay 4,700 yuan. The labor side advertised and deliberately reported the cost of living index lower each month, with nothing more than to deceive society and blame the management side. Also, the labor side claimed that the management side's cost of imported materials was as high as 200,000 yuan, while the cost of materials plus labor was only 60,000 yuan. This kind of accusation is unprecedented. The average cost of imported materials is about 100,000 yuan.</p>

Although it has been mediated by the General Labor Union and the Flour Mill Trade Association of the Fourth District, there has been no result. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene representatives from both sides at 2 PM today to discuss and mediate.</p>
<p>More than 200 unemployed workers from the Yitai Hing Coal Ball Factory on Macon Road marched to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning to petition for reinstatement.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Announces Results of Engineer Examination</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Most of the newly purchased ocean-going ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company use oil as fuel. The mechanism of this engine is slightly different from that of coal-fired engines, so there are very few engineers who manage oil engines. The company specifically held an examination, and it is heard that there were many applicants. The examination has been completed. Yesterday, the names of the 24 people who were accepted and the 5 alternates were announced. The names of the accepted and alternate engineers are listed below: Accepted: Sun Ken-hai, Chu Ah-fang, Li Chung-lin, Tung Hsiang-ming, Sun Hui-li, Chung Pao-fa, Chu Kai-ming, Ni An-jen, Chien Hao-ken, Chang Sun-hung, Hsu Hung-chiang, Chen Chang-shun, Chen Ah-feng, Chu Hsien-kwei, Chen Yuan-sheng, Wang Jui-chang, Su Hung-fa, Chiu Shun-kwei, Yu Shan-pen, Ku Ming-hai, Yang Tsai-fu, Yu An-ching, Ma Kuo-ching, Pao Wen-sheng. Alternates: Lu Fu-tao, Wu Li-li, Chang An-kang, Chu Ah-wan, Chu Hung-hsuan. The twenty-four engineers who have been accepted will be assigned to various American oil tankers for internship starting yesterday. They are required to board the ship at 8 AM and leave at 5 PM, under the guidance of engineer Kung Ying-tseng and Chief Mate Wang Yao.</p>
<h3>Problem of Streetcar Workers Reinstatement Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The labor dispute of the British Shanghai Electric Construction Company, in addition to the issues of sick leave and retirement, which were resolved last Saturday, the issue of adjusting basic wages and the reinstatement of unemployed workers was continued to be discussed at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. The meeting continued until late at night. The issue of reinstating unemployed workers was strongly debated. The workers demanded that 12 workers be reinstated for every additional streetcar, but the company only offered six. As a result, the Social Affairs Bureau proposed a compromise, and the number of workers to be reinstated for each additional streetcar would be decided by the Social Affairs Bureau, but must be between six and twelve. This long-standing problem was thus resolved. As for the workers' request to increase the basic wage to 45 yuan (the current minimum is one yuan per day, calculated according to the cost of living index, one day's deduction for one day's suspension), the meeting continued until late at night, and no solution was heard. Workers gathered to wait for news of the representatives' negotiations, and became very uneasy after waiting for a long time. If the negotiations were to reach a stalemate, it could cause another dispute.</p>

<h3>Stealing Skulls to Welcome the Gods: Defendant Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, Judge Cao of the Local Court opened the trial of a case of stealing skulls. Hu Xiantao, a 21-year-old Shanghai native living in a wooden house at the Nandamatou ferry, was a boatman. In the first month of this year, due to local customs, corpse heads had to be stolen before welcoming the gods at the festival, in order to prepare for worshipping the gods. Therefore, Hu Xiantao and the fugitive Xi Longsheng went to the grave of Hua Jinsheng in Guojiasha and its vicinity on the nights of the 16th and 17th, stealing two skulls, which they brought back to participate. Unexpectedly, the festival was banned by the authorities, so they abandoned the skulls. Later, Hua Jinsheng's wife, Mrs. Li, discovered this and reported it to the police, who investigated and brought them to justice. They were prosecuted for the crime of stealing remains under Article 247, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The defendant pleaded guilty in court. After defense by lawyer Dai Chuanyang, the sentence was immediately announced: imprisonment for two months.</p>

<h3>Monk Acts Righteously: Rescues American Pilot, Japanese Military Police Use Poisonous Torture, Non-Judicial Beatings Fracture Skull</h3>
<p>Following the Jiangyin Massacre, the Shanghai Military Tribunal also investigated the case of Xue the Monk, who was brutally murdered by the former Pudong Japanese military police for rescuing an American pilot. Yesterday, Gu Yongquan, the military prosecutor of the tribunal, completed the investigation and filed a public prosecution. The details of the case are as follows.</p>
<p>Intelligence in an Emergency: In January of last year, an American aircraft flew over Shanghai and attacked Longhua Airport, dropping many bombs and causing great damage to the enemy. The Japanese army's anti-aircraft fire was intense. The American aircraft was unfortunately damaged. Two American pilots parachuted out, one of whose name is unknown, landing in Xuejiazhaidi, Binpu Township, Sanlin Town, Pudong. The villagers all acted righteously, discussing rescue together. Later, the American friend was rescued by Xue the Monk, the head of the township. Because it was daytime, the former Pudong Japanese military police learned of this. Infuriated, they dispatched investigators everywhere, searching in every way, but found nothing. Xue the Monk, feeling the urgency of the situation, quickly changed the American friend's clothes and hid him in a watchman's shed in the fields, saving him from danger, and buried the rubber coat he was wearing to eliminate traces. At that time, the captain of the Pudong Japanese military police, Ono Shigeru (at large), Kuboe Yasuharu (male, 33 years old, from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, former head of the special intelligence section of the Japanese Pudong Military Police, in custody), Kataoka Akira (male, 29 years old, from Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, sergeant of the Yangsiqiao branch of the same unit, in custody), Omori Mitsuo (male, 27 years old, from Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, corporal of the Yangsiqiao branch of the same unit, in custody), Noma Teiji (male, 28 years old, from Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan, sergeant of the Dongchang Road branch of the same unit, in custody), Morishita Muneo (male, 24 years old, from Aichi Prefecture, Japan, private first class of the Dongchang Road branch of the same unit, in custody), and Hirata Seiichi (sergeant of the Dongchang Road branch of the same unit, at large), were eager to gain credit and searched repeatedly, but still found nothing.</p>
<p>Wanton Beatings: They relied on their power to be brutal, arresting Xue Quanyun, Xue Yatou, Xue Zhangdong (i.e., Guan Nv), Xue the Monk, and Xue Jinxing, and wantonly beating them. In addition to clubbing and kicking, they also tied Xue Quanyun's hands behind his back, hung him from the beams, and beat him with clubs, causing him to be covered in injuries. Two days later, they dragged Xue the Monk and Xue Jinxing to the Dongchang Road branch, confining them separately, and beating them with non-judicial methods, causing Xue the Monk's skull to crack, his arm bone to fracture, with only skin and flesh connecting it, and his legs and abdomen were also covered in scars. Before two days had passed, he died. They forced Xue Jinxing to wash the blood off the deceased's face and moved the body to Sanguantang. Xue Jinxing was also covered in injuries, and his legs were swollen as thick as buckets, but he still did not confess. The defendants had no choice but to release him. Kuboe Yasuharu then telephoned Kataoka, instructing him to order the Xue family to accompany Xue the Monk home. Kataoka then gave Xue Quangen a business card, ordering him to take the card. When he arrived, he saw that Xue the Monk was already lying dead in Sanguantang. Xue Quangen, terrified by their power, suppressed his grief and dared not say anything.</p>
<p>Scheduled Trial: After the Japanese army surrendered, Xue Quangen submitted three photos of the deceased and reported to the Third Area Army Prisoner of War Management Office, accusing them. On February 9 of this year, the Third Detachment of the Military Police arrested Kuboe Yasuharu and handed him over to the Prisoner of War Management Office, along with a rubber coat and a bottle of medicine, and transferred them to the tribunal for investigation. During the investigation, witnesses Xue Quangen, Xue Bingxiang, Xue Linggen, and the victim Xue Jinxing testified about the circumstances of the torture, and identified Kataoka, Omori, and Noma at the Japanese military police concentration camp in western Shanghai as the perpetrators of the torture. Morishita had also participated in the investigation and arrest of villagers. Therefore, the tribunal detained them for investigation. The case has been thoroughly investigated. Except for Ono Shigeru and Hirata Seiichi, who are at large and wanted, the five people in custody, Kuboe Yasuharu, Kataoka Akira, Omori Mitsuo, Noma Teiji, and Morishita Muneo, are suspected of violating Article 28, Article 278, Paragraph 1, and Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 1 and Article 2 of the War Crimes Trial Measures and Article 10 of the Implementing Regulations, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The tribunal will schedule a trial.</p>

The case has not yet been solved. It is now known that Chen Zhiqing, the chief of the Xujiahui Police Station in charge of the case, recently received a secret report that the ringleader of the case, Wang Jingzhai, is now working as a clerk in the Yunying Township Office in Haimen. Therefore, a few days ago, he sent plainclothes criminal investigation officer Ma Yiqiu of the Judicial Section, along with officers Chen Changhong and Chen Qigeng, carrying official documents, to the Qinglonggang Police Station in Haimen County. With the assistance of the 105th Division garrisoned there, they went to the address and arrested the ringleader Wang Jingzhai. Together with his newlywed wife Huang Songying, they were transported to the Xujiahui Branch of the Shanghai Police Bureau on the Jiangchang Wheel. After interrogation by Chen Kaizhou, the chief of the Judicial Section, he confessed that he had conspired with his accomplices, Luo Shihou, a current lieutenant special service officer in a certain unit, and Shang Yao and Chen Xixiang of the Tang District, to commit the robbery. Luo Shijun was subsequently arrested, but the Chen suspect escaped. Chief Chen immediately prepared a document to hand over the two criminals to the Garrison Headquarters for strict legal action.</p>

<h3>Chen Deliang Independently Develops Steel Wire Recorder</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Scientist Chen Deliang has been deeply engaged in scientific research, inventing many instruments over the years, earning the praise of all sectors and making him a rare talent in China's scientific community. Half a year ago, Chen began to independently research and experiment based on the magnetic recording principle of Danish scientist Valdemar Poulsen. He invented a method to create a steel wire recorder, which was successfully completed in April. It is said that Chen did not have any foreign materials to test when he was researching, and he designed and manufactured everything himself. However, its function is no less than that of a recorder manufactured in the United States.

<h3>First Interrogation: Cultural Traitor Tao Kangde Swaggered into Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, Judge Cao of the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court interrogated cultural traitor Tao Kangde for the first time. The traitor Tao submitted a lengthy defense statement of several thousand words, explaining his role as editor of the puppet "China Weekly" and his attendance at the "Greater East Asia Literary Conference." After Judge Cao's interrogation, he adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<p>The traitor Tao is a native of Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and is thirty-nine years old this year. He resides at No. 5, Lane 125, Jiaozhou Road. He did not receive a secondary education in his youth, but studied diligently on his own. Before the War of Resistance, he already held a considerable position in cultural circles. When Zou Taofen was the editor-in-chief of "Life" Weekly, Tao wrote "Telescope and Microscope," which was praised by many at the time. Later, he founded magazines such as "Cosmic Wind," "World Affairs," and "Great Wind," which were very popular for a time and highly respected in cultural circles. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he went to Hong Kong and, with the help of Xiong Shiyi, presided over the resumption of publication. In the spring of 1942, he defected to the enemy in Shanghai and served as the editor of the "China Weekly," a propaganda publication affiliated with the puppet "China Daily," promoting "peace movement." The following year, the publication ceased publication and he was dismissed. As a result, he was favored by the Japanese invaders and invited to participate in the "Greater East Asia Literary Conference" held in Tokyo. He was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters after the victory. After investigation by the High Procuratorate, he was formally prosecuted.</p>
<p>Still Seeking to Defeat the Enemy's Propaganda Passively</p>
<p>Still Claiming to Disrupt Enemy Propaganda in a Passive Way</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, when the defendant arrived in court, he was wearing a light brown silk robe, cloth shoes, and tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, with a very quiet demeanor. He stood in the defendant's box with his hands behind his back, swaggering as if giving a lecture, and often looked back as if searching for family members and acquaintances. After Judge Cao interrogated him one by one based on the indictment, the defendant immediately defended himself, claiming that the process of falling into the water was as follows: "After the National Army retreated west, the situation in Shanghai deteriorated, so I went to Hong Kong to plan the resumption of publications such as "Cosmic Wind," traveling between Guangzhou and Hong Kong to continue the cultural resistance. In October 1941, I returned to Shanghai once due to family matters. I originally planned to return to Hong Kong immediately and then go to the mainland, but the situation in the Pacific deteriorated and transportation was cut off, so I could not make the trip. Staying in Shanghai, making a living became a major problem. I wrote to old friends such as Lao She and Xu Xu in the mainland to find work, but received no good news. A friend introduced me to "China Weekly" to serve as an editor. I thought that the only things I could do were newspaper vendor, printing worker, and editor, and the first two jobs might promote enemy propaganda, while only the latter could disrupt their propaganda work. To be cautious, I also consulted with Zhu Wen, the acting director of the Propaganda Department of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and obtained his approval. I then proposed three conditions to the puppet side: (1) no speeches by important figures of the puppet Nanjing government should be published, (2) no current affairs reports should be published, and (3) I would not write any political opinions myself. The puppet side agreed to all of these, and I resolutely took the job, immediately changing the nature of the puppet "China Weekly," focusing especially on education and social issues. Therefore, my serving in this position was to use the puppet side's psychology of treating me as an ornament to disrupt their propaganda work in a passive way, and to actively collect information about the enemy."</p>
<p>When His Wife Sobbed He Said, "What Are You Crying About?"</p>
<p>As for participating in the "Greater East Asia Literary Conference," traitor Tao confessed that the conference was held three times (once each in 1942, 1943, and 1944). He refused to participate the first time. The second time, due to his position, he went after consulting with Committee Member Zhu. The conference lasted three days, discussing the translation of classical Chinese and Japanese literature. Japanese writers such as Mushanokoji Saneatsu, Sato Haruo, and Tanizaki Junichiro participated. After returning to China, he made a report and submitted it to Zhu Wen, who forwarded it to Wu Shaoshu, who praised it highly. Judge Cao asked, "How many people were in the Chinese delegation attending the conference?" He replied, "Forty-eight." Asked, "Who was the head of the delegation? Who were the central figures?" Traitor Tao faltered and said, "If it is not necessary, please allow me to remain silent. Because I have already been harmed, I don't want to implicate others." Judge Cao then asked him to submit it in writing. Subsequently, lawyer Ma Shuyong presented several documents, stating that Gao Jilin (Ke Ling), a propaganda officer in the Southeast District, was arrested by the enemy twice, and was rescued by the defendant, and that the defendant had taken great risks to print anti-Japanese propaganda materials for our underground workers. After the interrogation was completed, the defendant met with his family. His wife cried uncontrollably, and traitor Tao said loudly, "What am I worth crying about? Our country is what you should be crying for!" The court adjourned the hearing to a later date, and the defendant was taken back into custody. Yesterday morning, the case of Zhu Changsheng, the head of Minhang Bao, was also heard, accusing him of taking advantage of his power to bully good people during the enemy occupation. Two witnesses, Zhu Shanglin and Zhang Futian, testified in court. After Judge Cao interrogated them one by one, he also adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<h3>Wuhan University Preparatory Class: Impoverished Students Worry About Dropping Out</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou News] The university preparatory class established by the Ministry of Education in Wuhan began classes on the 1st of this month. Wuchang Wenhua Public Academy is the headquarters, accommodating 200 boarding female students and 200 day male students. The Boxue Academy in Qiaokou, Hankou, is a branch school, accommodating 800 male students. The Hubei Branch of the Executive Yuan allocated a batch of flour to provide relief to the teachers and students of the class, but the quota was limited to only 300 people, with each person receiving 45 pounds per month. The class has recently decided to distribute it to 270 students and 30 faculty members, and each person must find three guarantors, and the guarantors cannot receive the allowance, so this matter is extremely difficult to handle. Regarding the loan for impoverished students, the Ministry of Education has limited the number of applicants to 400, with each person receiving 5,000 yuan per month, and each person must find two guarantors, which means that only one out of three people can apply, but everyone wants to receive the loan, which is also not easy to handle. The boarding students' food expenses are 18,000 yuan per month, plus the cost of books and stationery. If there is no public funding to receive, impoverished students will have no place to study.</p>

<h3>Silversmiths Rush in, Gold Price Rises Again by 100,000 - Peak Reached 1.85 Million - Allotment Price Increased to 1.76 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold continued to be sought after, with people being stimulated by various rumors. Buying was more than constant. The Central Bank allotted 561 bars to the industry and was forced to raise the price to 1.76 million yuan. Before the morning opening, the external futures market was already reported to be soaring. In addition to the Da Tong firm taking a holiday on Sunday, all the small firms and silversmiths in the four suburbs rushed to make up for the previous deficits. Bids on the grey market had already soared to over 1.8 million. At the official opening, it was around 1.8 million. After the opening, it was bid up to over 1.85 million before pressure appeared, and bulls also sold off. Securities firms took profits, gradually falling. Around 10 o'clock, it hovered around 1.77 million for a long time, forming a tug-of-war. The Central Bank then allotted 56 bars to the industry at a price of 1.76 million. After the allotment was completed, speculation revived, and it once rose to over 1.8 million. However, the US dollar did not follow suit, causing arbitrage selling, and it once fell back to 1.73 million. At noon, there were still buyers active, taking advantage of the banks' lunch break to push the market price up to 1.83 million. The Central Bank applied pressure again, and it retreated to within 1.8 million. However, it still stood outside 1.8 million in the end. As a result, it rose again by 100,000 compared to the previous closing. Gold jewelry was listed at 192,000, silver ingots at 1,700, and silver dollars were sold at 1,090 yuan. Shadow interest rates were slightly looser, with interest rates ranging from 1.6 to 2 cents.</p>
<h3>Banks Have Abundant Supply, US Dollar Unable to Rise - Heavy Atmosphere of Hong Kong Dollar Devaluation</h3>
<p>The US dollar was being sold high by US merchant banks, not as sharp as gold. The arbitrage spread against gold opened to over 760 yuan. At the morning opening, it was at 2,450 yuan to 2,500 yuan, but soon fell steadily. Although importers had settlements to prepare for use, they were helpless against the continuous supply from US banks and finally could not hold on, retreating to within 2,300 yuan. At noon, the gold market revived, the arbitrage spread opened too much, causing arbitrage buying, and it rose again to around 2,350 yuan. The afternoon situation was stable, hovering outside 2,300 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. The Hong Kong dollar was initially affected by gold and silver, once seeing a high price of 440 yuan. Finally, due to heavy news of Hong Kong dollar devaluation and loose Hong Kong exchange rates, it fell again. As a result, it retreated by 5 yuan, with Hong Kong exchange rates at 420 yuan and rupees at 520 yuan, all being sold. The US exchange rate was flat and stagnant.</p>
<h3>Large Investors Intervene, Government Bonds Turn Around</h3>
<p>Government bonds turned volatile after rising yesterday. The environment was unfavorable midway. Unified Class C fell from 7,100 yuan to around 6,350 yuan. After the bulls were almost completely slaughtered, large firms in the industry began to buy in, rising to around 7,150 yuan. Northern buyers took profits and exchanged gold for bonds, and the situation changed. The midday closing resulted in a rise of 250 compared to the previous closing. Classes A, B, and D were all flat, and Class E rose slightly by 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Running Dry - Hot Items Fangjian Not Yet on Sale</h3>
<p>The yarn market situation yesterday was calm at the beginning. News then spread that Tianjin buyers were competing to handle fine yarn, and because gold continued to soar, buying revived at the time of the clouds. It was also heard that Fangjian Company happened to be at the time of opening yarn, planning to sell 26 types of yarn of all grades, mostly 10-count and 60/80 and 100 fine yarns. 42-count and 32-count hot items were not yet included, so the supply of chips on the market became increasingly dry. Therefore, the situation became increasingly tight. As a result, 42-count Shuiyue and 20-count Baizhu Boat brands each rose by 560,000, and the remaining yarns rose by 120,000. Cloth merchants and door shops were still enthusiastic about grey light twill, and the price rose again by more than 1,000. The fortunes of other brands varied. The price of New American cotton in the flower market rose by 2 to 17 pounds. The near-term US dollar was 27.40, the far-term was 27.95, and the current spot price of Metrelin was 28.20. The current spot cotton transaction in this port was normal, with only Zhongxin First Factory and its peers slightly improving. The remaining factories remained on the sidelines.</p>
<h3>Hemp Market Flat</h3>
<p>Before the war, hemp was mainly sold to Europe. Since August 13th, exports have been hindered, and domestic transportation has not been smooth, so the source in this port has been interrupted. After the victory, arrivals have not been smooth. There have been only a few arrivals this spring, only one-tenth or two-tenths compared to the previous arrivals and sales. Recently, although there have been slightly more arrivals, no foreign sales have been seen. It is only for domestic sales, and those engaged in this are not interested. The market is temporarily difficult to develop, so prices do not rise or fall much. Recently, the selling prices of each hemp shop are 65,000 yuan per shi dan for white hemp, 65,000 yuan for Yuanjiang hemp, and 60,000 yuan for Qing hemp.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Shortage and Price Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market suddenly rose due to the shortage of spot goods and more demand. The association's settlement price for medium white sugar was initially 62,000 yuan in the morning, then to 65,000 yuan to 5,500 yuan, and in the afternoon it rose further to 67,000 yuan, rising 67,000 yuan before and after. Other miscellaneous goods also followed suit. The opening price of Diao Qing was very chaotic in the morning, with thousands of yuan coming in and out. The official market price was in the range of 48,000 yuan, and it rose to 50,000 yuan in the afternoon. It rose 45,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Domestically Produced Bicycles Sold for 153,000</h3>
<p>After being taken over by the Resources Committee, the Shanghai Machine Factory recently manufactured many 26-inch Anchor brand bicycles, and the test results were quite satisfactory. It plans to start total sales immediately, with a list price of 180,000 yuan in national currency. From the 10th of this month, it will be calculated at 85% off, selling for 153,000 yuan less per vehicle. The receiving office is Room 310, Shanghai City Bank Building, 50 Jiujiang Road.</p>
<h3>Securities Firms Withdraw Gold to Exchange for Stocks - Market Gradually Turns from Fatigue to Stability</h3>
<p>The stock market continued to be unstable, advancing and retreating suddenly. The overall trend was slightly stable after fatigue, but small stocks were getting worse, and the overall trend was tragic. It rose and fell midway. Yongsha fell from 5,030 yuan to 4,750 yuan, Meiya fell from 4,150 yuan to 3,880 yuan, Jingfu fell from 340 yuan to 325 yuan, Xinguang fell from 290 yuan to 268 yuan, and Qinxing fell from 240 yuan to 225 yuan. They all rose slightly at noon. Securities firms filled shorts, withdrew gold to exchange for stocks, so the hot situation gradually stabilized, and small stocks still felt lagging. The results were slightly higher for Yongsha Meiya compared to the previous closing. Other stocks all fell except for Zhongfang Match. Only Yongsha Meiya traded overnight in the afternoon, and the bids continued to rise. Foreign stocks were also tired and stable at first. There were many trades midway, with Yisha in and out of the 1,300 mark, showing a tug-of-war. The results of each stock were similar to last Saturday, but Yisha rose slightly in the afternoon, while Meilian and others fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Silk is All Sought After</h3>
<p>Yesterday's City 120 Tianqiao had Guang Renzao silk, opening at 1.39 million yuan, with the minimum at 1.36 million yuan, and closing at 380,000 yuan. The afternoon price was 1.4 million yuan, resulting in a large increase of 670,000 yuan compared to last weekend. 75 Golden Rooster semi-gloss, goods were scarce and sought after, and the price was also very good. Affected by the rise in gold prices, the price of factory silk has increased by about 50,000 yuan in each grade. The market price of silk fabrics has also followed, with Wan Ya quilt cover at 70,000 yuan per 100 pieces, and Da Cheng plaid crepe at 4,130 yuan per yard, 300 yuan higher than last weekend. The price of Sheng goods was also shouting up by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Niliu Cloth Sales Uneven</h3>
<p>Nirong sales have been sluggish for the past few weeks. Although there are a few small customer groups, they are all scattered. The various groups in this street regret that it is difficult to take action at such a high price, and since the Western clothing tailoring groups are on strike, the way out has been reduced by half. However, khaki fabrics of yellow and green colors are quite popular in the current sales market, and both Beijing and Hangzhou have a large number of searches. Each yard ranges from 1,5600 yuan to 3,000 yuan. In view of the lack of goods circulation, most of them are purchasing white blanks for dyeing. For example, the Nanjing gang all used light yellow rainproof cloth instead, and more than 10,000 yards have been shipped one after another.</p>
<h3>Extracting Green Tea of 700 Crates: First Shipment to India Last Week</h3>
<p>It has been observed that before the war, Bombay, India, had a considerable annual export of Chinese tea. However, after the victory, due to transportation issues, no shipments had been made. It is now learned from sources there that there is a current demand for Choungong green tea. To meet this urgent need, Ruichang Foreign Firm in this city shipped 700 crates as the first trial shipment last week. If there are no unforeseen problems, subsequent shipments are expected to continue steadily. It is also heard that foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson are also preparing for action. As for the tea market situation in this city, the price of Wenzhou new Qiqiang tea has softened due to a surge in arrivals and poor quality. News from Hangzhou indicates that merchants from Tianjin and Nanjing are already active in the production areas, which has boosted confidence and pushed prices higher than last week. The supply and demand for aged red and green tea are balanced, and the market sentiment is stable.</p>
<p>The price of Mao tea in Tunxi has plummeted. Qimen black tea has already been released to the market. It is reported that banks are wary of transporting due to frequent robberies on the Hangzhou-Anhui Road, and tea merchants are also taking a wait-and-see attitude due to sluggish tea sales in Shanghai. The purchasing price of Mao tea has fallen from 800 yuan to 200 yuan per catty, which is lower than the production cost for farmers. The picking season has passed, and tea merchants are currently processing the tea.</p>
<p>Observations from the UK: A dispatch from the British Information Service in London on the 13th states that "The Economist" reports: As the tea season approaches, Chinese tea merchants are striving to restore tea exports. The industry has requested substantial loans from the "Four Banks." Although tea exports are unlikely to return to the pre-war level of 80 to 100 million pounds annually, the reorganization of organized Chinese export trade is noteworthy. Tea plantations in the Dutch East Indies suffered severe damage during the war and cannot be supplied in large quantities for the time being. Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaya have no tea markets. India, Ceylon, and British East Africa have borne most of the world's tea tonnage in the past five tea seasons and are now suffering from the impact of excessive picking in the past and insufficient fertilization. Therefore, it is currently imperative to increase the production of war-torn tea sources.</p>
<p>The Chinese government believes that if a market can be found, China can still export approximately 200 million pounds of tea. The reason for the sharp decline in the world's demand for Chinese tea in the past decade is that the Chinese tea industry is lagging behind India, Ceylon, and the Dutch East Indies in production methods. Therefore, the Chinese government is preparing a major improvement plan, which is timely but may take several years to fully take effect.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Dutch East Indies and other Eastern tea exporting countries may gradually restore their pre-war export volumes. Against this background, the Chinese tea export movement will inevitably encounter difficulties and friction. The future trend of world tea consumption cannot be estimated at present. It is also possible that the world tea supply may exceed demand in a few years. If this is the case, international cooperation will inevitably resume, and China will also be included.</p>
<h3>American and British Paint Merchants: Temporary Suspension of Orders</h3>
<p>American merchants such as Nanxing, Hengxin, and Jishi, and British merchants such as Brunner Mond &amp; Co., who promoted paints in China before the war, have now resumed business in China, selling spot goods and accepting pre-orders. It is understood that each company has received many orders in the past six months. However, due to the fact that the manufacturing equipment of the paint factories in the UK and the US is in the initial stages of restoration (major paint factories were converted to produce military chemicals during the war), coupled with the strike wave in the US, current production is limited. Each company in Shanghai has now received telegrams from their domestic factories and headquarters to temporarily suspend accepting orders. The orders that have already been accepted will be gradually completed by the winter of this year.</p>
<h3>US Chamber of Commerce Holds: Foreign Trade Week, Actively Developing Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the US Information Service, Washington, December 12] The US Chamber of Commerce announced on the 8th that it has sent letters to community organizations across the US, inviting them to participate in the Foreign Trade Week from May 19 to 25. Foreign Trade Week includes Maritime Day on the 22nd, which commemorates the first US ship traversing the Atlantic Ocean in 1918. The Chamber of Commerce calls on all parties to actively develop foreign trade this year. President Truman has said that this year is "a decisive year." The Chamber points out that one of the important plans this year is to convene an international trade conference to discuss the establishment of an international trade organization. This proposed organization will be a worldwide organization to promote international trade. The primary task of developing international trade is to rebuild the peacetime merchant fleet and establish international airlines. The Chamber of Commerce continued: Congress is currently studying legislation on trade agreements between the United States and more than fourteen countries, which is a clear demonstration of the United States' emphasis on international trade.</p>
<h3>After Taiwan's Return to China: Changes in Far East Sugar Supply, China's Consumption Will Increase Greatly</h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, December 13) Czarnikow Ltd. published an article reviewing the world sugar situation, stating that Taiwan's return to China has completely changed the Far East's sugar supply situation. Due to the lack of sugarcane and fertilizers, it will take some time for Taiwan to resume sugar exports. However, in the 1938-39 season, the island produced 1,356,000 tons of sugar, almost all of which was exported to Japan. Japan's domestic sugar production is only 45,000 tons per year, while its demand reaches 1,149,000 tons. In the future, Japan may not be able to restore its pre-war sugar consumption level of 24 pounds per person per year. China's sugar consumption will increase significantly. Before the war, due to the low purchasing power of the Chinese people, each person consumed only 4 pounds of sugar per year. Even after absorbing all of Taiwan's sugar, its consumption level will still be lower than that of Europeans.</p>
<h3>Under Close Attention from All Parties: Rice Prices Stopped Advancing Yesterday, Grain Merchants Going to Production Areas to Purchase, Association Certificate Allows Passage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both arrivals and sales in the rice market were weak. Both Japonica and Indica rice fell by slightly less than 1,000 yuan. However, the price of early thin rice and Baiyuan rice from the South Road remained unchanged. Sales of flour in other provinces weakened, and the local market followed suit with a wait-and-see attitude. Prices were firm in the morning but weakened in the afternoon, with no gains or losses. Soybean cake and bran showed little fluctuation. High-quality soybeans fell by 1,000 yuan, while medium and low quality soybeans remained unchanged. Mung beans from Southeast Asia were selectively bought at high prices, and the price was higher for better quality beans. The same was true for sesame, with high-quality sesame being popular and lower-quality sesame remaining stable. Raw peanuts were similar. The corn market in Qingdao moved but was not strong, and the market situation was stable. Red sorghum rose by 1,000 yuan. Sales in Shantou were balanced, with no immediate changes. It is heard that Brazilian foreign rice is also under negotiation, with a price of 30,000 yuan per stone. According to rice market information, yesterday's rice arrivals in this city totaled over 6,000 stones. The types and quantities of rice are as follows: 3,125 stones of white Japonica rice, 917 stones of thin rice, 950 stones of early rice, 40 stones of Yang Indica rice, 714 stones of Du Indica rice, 365 stones of Wu Indica rice, 35 stones of Baiyuan rice, and 30 stones of Yinyuan rice.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A large amount of Wuhu rice will arrive in port soon, transported by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company motorized sailing vessels. It is heard that one ship is carrying more than 1,000 bags and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<h3>Association Issues: Grain Merchant Purchase and Transport Permits</h3>
<p>Another report: Pang Songzhou, Deputy Minister of Food, came to Shanghai last week to handle emergency measures for food administration. After discussing the issue of food regulation with relevant authorities, it was agreed that grain merchants would be allowed to travel to rice producing areas for purchasing without restrictions. Therefore, the merchants were urged to begin group purchasing immediately. All grain merchants traveling to rice producing areas for purchasing only need a certificate from the industry association to transport rice to Shanghai as much as possible. The Grain and Rice Association of this city, under orders to process transport permits for grain merchants, officially began issuing them yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. The original text is as follows: "It is hereby reported by our member, Mr./Ms. ____, that they intend to purchase rice in the following areas to transport to Shanghai to support the food supply for the people. A request for a certificate has been received, and it is found to be consistent with the facts. Therefore, this certificate is issued with the hope that military police along the way will inspect and release. This certificate includes the following information: purchasing area, product name, quantity, destination. This is for receipt by member ____ company." Furthermore, to prevent abuse, it has been stipulated that this certificate is valid for only half a month and will expire afterwards.</p>
<h3>Rice Loan: Trial Run Ends After One Month</h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of rice loans, the Food Administration Department announced yesterday that the loan amount decided for grain merchants was 1 billion yuan, and the actual amount loaned out was 940 million yuan. The grain merchants who received the loans purchased rice in Jiangsu and Anhui, which arrived in port continuously. This coincided with rising grain prices in various places, allowing the grain merchants to earn substantial profits in a short period of time, which led to the disturbances in the rice market in this city on the 19th of last month. Therefore, the department announced the suspension of sales of all rice that had arrived in port and was purchased with loans, pending discussion and resolution by the Loan Review Subcommittee. The subcommittee held its third meeting on the 10th and decided to hand over the rice purchased with loans that was already in warehouses to the Grain and Rice Industry Association for sale on the rice market in batches. The price would be slightly lower than the market price. As for the profits earned by the loan merchants, the Food Administration Department will require the loan merchants to submit report forms and receipts for review and then report to the meeting to decide on the handling methods. It was also decided that the grain merchant loan trial run would end after one month, and all loan merchants would be notified to return both the principal and interest to the bank.</p>
<h3>Lumber Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new ship, Deng Keng, made its first voyage to Fuzhou and returned to Shanghai yesterday, carrying a full load of lumber, totaling more than 25,000 pieces. The size of the pieces is unknown.</p>
<h3>American Pig Bristle Association: Telegram Requests Revision of Sizes</h3>
<p>[Tianjin News] After the victory, the quality of pig bristles exported from Tianjin to the United States was low and did not meet the standards. The New York Pig Bristle Association and the New York American Brush Manufacturing Association jointly telegraphed the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, stipulating the pig bristle manufacturing methods and size standards. The following is a translated excerpt from the telegram: We hereby represent our country's importers and users in telegrahically requesting your Chamber of Commerce to pay attention to the reform of the size of exported pig bristles to meet the standards. The measurement of 2.2 inches is 40%, 2.5 inches is 70%, and 2.75 inches or more is 80%. The minimum size is 2.25 inches. The total length of the bristles in the bundle must be an additional eighth of an inch (i.e., if the bristle bundle is two and a quarter inches, the bundle must be two and three-eighths inches long).</p>
<h3>Shuttleless Loom: Already Applied in the UK</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the British Information Service, London, December 13] A shuttleless loom is being used to manufacture fabrics at a factory in the county of Dumbie in the UK. This new machine can manufacture fabrics that ordinary looms cannot. It can also continuously weave stone wool raw materials. It is noiseless and vibration-free. It is said that one skilled worker and one assistant can easily oversee twenty-four shuttleless looms. This machine automatically wove canvas for eight hours without any workers attending to it. If a suitable warp thread is used, it can continue weaving for twenty-four hours without stopping.</p>

<h3>A Journey to Taitung: On the Edge of the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<p>— A Maritime Dispatch from This Newspaper on the 8th: By Mu Yun, Special Correspondent in Taiwan</p>
<p>In Taiwan, people enjoy going to Taipei or taking a stroll in the central and southern regions, while Taitung is regarded as a daunting destination. The main reason is determined by the geographical environment. To the west, north, and south of the Central Mountain Range, there are vast plains, flat terrain, and abundant agricultural products, as well as Taiwan's specialties of tea, matting, bananas, and watermelons. However, in Taitung, apart from the beach along the Pacific Ocean, there is a strip-like plain where rice is grown. The rest is filled with peaks and hills, inhabited by the local Taiwanese and the indigenous people who live in the mountains. Contact with the outside world is limited, and transportation is difficult, all of which are facts.</p>
<p>The most important purpose of this trip for the reporter, from Taipei to Taitung, is not only to widely delve into the various classes of this province, but also to investigate the political facilities of the authorities after the takeover. I also want to see what depth it has advanced in the remote corners of the villages on the edge of this barren East Pacific Ocean. Of course, the beautiful scenery is also what the reporter is pursuing.</p>
<p>Moving Through the Mining Area</p>
<p>From the provincial capital to Su'ao, there is only one connecting train each day, not in Keelung, but at Badu, an intersection less than one stop away from Keelung. The reporter and two others boarded the 11:17 am train, and at 12:25 pm, we turned into the Eastern Line and sat down on the peeling-skinned seats. After criticism from all parties and the determination of the officials to reform, the chaotic transportation situation in Taiwan has been adjusted. Trains run on time, soldiers buy tickets, and queue up to stamp their tickets. However, demanding the prompt repair and renovation of the train carriages is still a tall order because the heat wave of over 80 degrees makes it difficult for passengers trapped in the carriages to breathe even with fans. Poor quality smoke billowed onto our faces and collars like rain. The train passed through the foothills and mountainsides, with more than forty tunnels allowing the train to pass. We did not have time to count them in detail, but we only felt that we were not tourists but miners, like those described by Sinclair, in the hundreds of miles of continuous mining area.</p>
<p>This line is truly a mining area. Nuan Nuan's coal, Sijiaoting, and Ruifang's coal mines are the best and most productive. Ruifang's Jinguashi Mine is a famous place. The mining area covers 5,510,000 ping. Thirteen years ago, the annual production of gold reached 1,481 kilograms, silver 4,394 kilograms, and copper 3,025,000 kilograms. Houtong and Wudankeng stations also produce coal, and it is smokeless coal. At Dali Jian Station, you can see the boundless ocean. Among the beautiful and unique rock formations, passing Daxi, you can see Turtle Mountain, which is 4.9 kilometers away from the land on the ocean surface.</p>
<p>Yilan and Luodong are rainy. In the rain, if it weren't for the ocean, this area could easily remind one that this was originally a fiery land of Jiangnan. Near the train station, there is a continuous stretch of villages, tile houses and thatched huts, melon sheds and vegetable gardens, simple fences, pomegranate flowers, and herdsmen wearing bamboo hats leading water buffaloes on the coal-filled highway. Rows of rice fields lie quietly on the foothills. You can deeply feel that "the scenery of Jiangnan is the same everywhere."</p>
<p>At 3:30 pm, we arrived at the end of the Yilan Line - Su'ao. The whole journey is about the distance from Shanghai to Hangzhou, taking four hours. The second-class connecting ticket costs 48 Taiwan dollars.</p>
<p>Su'ao Night Talk</p>
<p>Su'ao is not only a small town in Taitung, but also the smallest district in the province. The Japanese used to set up counties, but now they have been changed to district offices, under the jurisdiction of Taipei County. This is a remote mountainous area on the eastern border. The things at the edge of the town are the ocean, surrounded by mountains on the west, north, and south sides. The whole district has only more than 500 households, with a total population of 30,000. Below the district office, there is only one town office, which controls twelve villages. The simple administrative structure is probably rare in the country.</p>
<p>I met District Chief Xie, a graduate of the Taiwan Training Class of the Central Training Corps (I want to especially mention the Taiwan Training Class of the Central Training Corps, because most of them serve as the main local administrative cadres, and the students of the Central Police Academy control the police affairs of the whole province, which are two powerful systems). He is young and talented, spending a life like squatting in a dilapidated temple, passing the days with the sound of morning bells and evening drums. He came here a month ago, and the unfortunate riot incident that occurred last month made him feel discouraged and unwilling to continue! He told the reporter that at 2:30 am on March 20, a fire broke out in the district office. The cause was that the workers, to practice the customs of the province and afraid of earthquakes, started a fire for sacrifice, and the sparks ignited. As a result, due to the lack of perfect fire-fighting equipment, they borrowed help from the Luodong Fire Brigade in the neighboring district. By the time they arrived, the quadrangle district office of 28 ping had been reduced to ashes, and the 40-ping house had been demolished. The accurate estimate is that the loss is more than 3.59 million Taiwan dollars. This cannot be said to be just the misfortune of the district office, but the great misfortune of the 121,000 people in Su'ao District. All the documents withdrawn by Japanese expatriates and the public affairs of the past fifty years were destroyed. At the same time as the disaster, the volunteer police team caused trouble again, resulting in the district chief being beaten and kicked. Afterwards, the incident was reported to the higher-ups, and the perpetrator was taken to the county police station. After the volunteer police team was disbanded, eight of the ringleaders were imprisoned in the Garrison Command. This storm attracted the attention of people all over the province, especially this "planned" "mass riot," which opened a new page in the history of Taiwan's reconstruction.</p>
<p>The district chief continued, "Now a company of the National Army, as well as artillery, is responsible for maintaining law and order, which is very quiet." Then he sighed, "The ringleaders of the fire are said to have been released on bail... I am no matter what, unwilling to continue doing this!"</p>
<p>On the edge of the ocean in the desolate mountain village, we spent a night. The next morning, it was a sunny day, and we took a car to Hualien Port for eight yuan, heading to Dong'ao.</p>
<p>Su'ao can be said to have no market. Various strange fish are produced along the ocean: squid, flying fish, tuna, marlin, fins, mackerel, and sharks with fins famous in the mainland. South of the port, digging a T-shaped Southern Australia with a water depth of 23 meters is an excellent fishing port. At one time, when commodity prices in Shanghai and Taiwan were not yet balanced, this was the best smuggling port, but now there is less smuggling, because there are no goods to export that can make money. However, there are many travelers here, and those going to Hualien Port must stay overnight before taking a car. The total distance is 120 kilometers. In early April, due to the terrain, a section 45 kilometers away from Hualien collapsed, requiring a 45-minute walk. Originally, there were four cars running in each direction every day, but now it has been changed to two.</p>
<p>The Road Along the Sea</p>
<p>Because we wanted to see the beautiful scenery along the edge of the Pacific Ocean and visit a small sugar factory, we spent an hour arriving at Dong'ao, which has a population of only 1,000 people. The highway is carved into a single-lane road on the side of the mountain. The car is traveling close to the cliff, with an S-shaped bend every two or three seconds. Looking out the window, on one side is a verdant mountain within reach, mountains connecting mountains, mountains surrounding mountains, and mountains encircling mountains. There are white clouds on the top of the mountain, white clouds in love with the mountain, and the clear sky is above the mountain. On the other side is a deep valley with towering cliffs, overlapping strange rocks, and the azure Pacific Ocean kissing it tightly. Sitting in the carriage, imagining what kind of magical place it would be, one cannot understand it without personally experiencing it. You must love the majestic and magnificent beauty of the high mountains and the vast ocean, but you must also deeply feel that this is an adventurous and beautiful journey. The Japanese praised this as one of the eight scenic spots in Taiwan. I feel that the steep Stevenson Highway in China is not as beautiful because it has no ocean or turbulent waves.</p>
<p>I understand more about how the Japanese exhausted their efforts. From the fifth year of Taisho to April of the sixth year of Showa, it took fifteen years, costing 5 million yen, and sacrificing fifty-eight people to build this road of struggle, connecting the traffic of eastern Taiwan. From the road surface engineering and the construction of bridges between mountains, I would never have dreamed that fifty-one years later, it would still return to China. I praise the greatness of the coastal road, the greatness of controlling nature, but I cannot help but sigh to the sky for the political shortsightedness and the arrogance of the Japanese warlords! The vitality of life is more vibrant here. I believe this is the greatest beauty in the East!</p>
<p>Returning, we lay on the straw mat, recalling this journey, feeling lingering fear and aftertaste.</p>
<h3>Eight Years of Struggle in Kunming · Imminent Return North: Southwest Associated University Erects a Monument</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Kunming, 7th (via airmail) by Correspondent Zhang Shengli</p>
<p>The Southwest Associated University, which began and ended with the War of Resistance, concluded operations in Kunming on "May Fourth". Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University will soon relocate back to Beijing and Tianjin, to resume their former endeavors. From their southward migration to their northward return, nearly nine autumns will have passed. The past events of this university are recountable, and our memories are still fresh. We recount its general outline, to serve as a reference.</p>
<p>Speaking of Southwest Associated University, there is no shortage of both praise and criticism. Opinions vary, and this reporter will refrain from taking a position. However, its hardships and achievements have left a "monument of five-colored splendor" in wartime higher education.</p>
<p>Old Wounds and New Pains Compete and Torment</p>
<p>Most of the students at the Associated University came from war zones, faced financial difficulties, and lived hard lives. The high cost of living in Kunming was often the highest in the country. They lived under a "hump"-like cost of living index and relied on loans, work-study programs, and part-time jobs to complete their studies. With inadequate clothing and footwear, proper daily nutrition was out of the question. With both physical and mental distress, it was even more difficult to strengthen the atmosphere of research. In the early days after the Associated University arrived in Kunming, many students held teaching positions in various schools. This later expanded to various organizations and groups, and then to factories and homes. However, because there were more monks than porridge, many were left empty-handed. Some even worked part-time firing the midday gun in Kunming. Although this was passed on as a fine anecdote, the intention was indeed earnest. This kind of all-pervasive part-time work made them more aware of the dark side of urban life. Old wounds and new pains intertwined in the minds and bodies of young people. Moreover, in the highest institutions of learning, with freedom of speech, association, and research, they were idealistic about the future, sensitive to the present, and not easily forgetting the past. Therefore, there were often cries of injustice and voices of righteousness, expressed in wall posters, gatherings, or propaganda marches. It is likely that the mixed reputation stems from this. The so-called "Associated University students are fond of meddling" can probably be explained in this way. As for politically motivated activities with ulterior motives, we will not discuss them here.</p>
<p>Wearing Western Suits, Looking Like Important Officials</p>
<p>The Faculty of Arts and Law of the Associated University was initially established in Mengzi, southern Yunnan. When they arrived, local soldiers, seeing them in Western suits, suspected that they were important officials from the central government and often stood at attention and saluted them. The county produced rattan canes, which were inexpensive and of good quality. Each student of the Associated University had one, which further enhanced their "important official" demeanor. The female students of the university took the route through Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Haiphong to enter Yunnan. The exotic and glamorous clothes they brought from Hong Kong astonished the local people. Some mischievous children even surrounded the female students and peered inside their cheongsams to see if they were wearing trousers underneath. The atmosphere can be imagined. The female dormitory was rented from the residence of the wealthiest Zhou family in the area. Their study room was outside the city. Every night, when the female students walked back to the dormitory in groups, they were escorted by armed school police to avoid being mocked by frivolous individuals. The prices there were very low, the scenery was quite good, and the people lived very leisurely lives. The teachers and students of the Associated University, having escaped the threat of gunfire, entered this quiet and beautiful realm. Some felt quite troubled by the quiet. Before the Battle of Wuhan, the female students in the "ivory tower" left behind a relative in Mengzi. Some said, "This is to celebrate the opening of the Associated University."</p>
<p>Speaking of the eight years of life for the students of the Associated University in Kunming, there is naturally no shortage of elegant and anecdotal stories, but many of them are tragedies, comedies, and farces. When they first arrived in Kunming, they were unfamiliar with the local customs. When male and female students walked hand-in-hand and shoulder-to-shoulder through the city, the police regarded it as damaging to public morals and punished them by slapping their palms in the street. This was a "comedy." There were also cases of male and female students committing suicide by poisoning themselves due to love problems. This was a tragedy. When the Associated University was first established, the school buildings were narrow and there were few electric lights. Students had no place to study, so they went to teahouses in groups to copy notes, do exercises, play bridge, or chat in circles, talking and arguing loudly, as if there was no one else around. Those who whispered quietly seemed to be sitting in a secret room. Within one room, each had their own world. Across one table, the activity and silence were completely different. Although the number of teahouses on Fengzhu Street and Wenlin Street increased greatly due to demand, in the past, there were no learned scholars coming and going, and the customers were all students. The business was light and the profits were very meager. As for those who were in love, most of them were cheap social gatherings, eating a bowl of rice noodles or two baked cakes with relish, and both the man and woman were delighted. Naturally, there was no shortage of farces among them.</p>
<p>The Germination of Points, The Spread of Lines</p>
<p>After the reopening of the Burma Road, the atmosphere in Kunming changed dramatically. Later, with the arrival of American troops in Kunming and frequent airlifts between China and India, the cost of living in Kunming became increasingly expensive and extravagant. This deepened the threats and troubles for the students of the Associated University in both spirit and material terms. Brokers and the "international route" gradually spread from the germination of points into the spread of lines. The students of the Associated University were not all saintly and virtuous – although the number was very small – and the words of insinuation from the outside world also made it difficult for those who cherished the spirit of the Associated University to distinguish whether it was a "groundless accusation." The students of the Associated University believed that this was a scandal for the school and launched a drum-beating attack against the "international route" within the school. Cold ridicule and heated scolding, leaflets everywhere, and the trend gradually subsided.</p>

<p>After the start of the counter-offensive in western Yunnan, the dance craze gradually rose in Kunming, and is now too prevalent. In private dance parties, one can often see students of the Associated University, but very few enter commercial dance halls. Near the female dormitories of the school, one can sometimes see Jeeps picking up and dropping off dance partners, which is only enough to attract the attention of ordinary people, and rarely leads to excessive speculation. As for the brokers among the male students, although they are not generally noticed, they are also very troubled when discussing this matter. The targets of the brokers are mostly American soldiers and related personnel. The items traded are mostly buying and selling US dollars, American military supplies, and Chinese specialties or native products. Such individuals, even in the last two years of the Associated University, accounted for only one or two percent.</p>
<p>Several Alarms a Day During Air Raids</p>
<p>Before 1941, the scope of student activities at the Associated University mostly focused on the campus. The characteristics of that time were ball games, wall posters, lectures, and seminars. Old Peking University students, although not interested in sports, often told each other, "Only physical education cannot be careless." This was thanks to their love for Tsinghua. At that time, students from North China, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Southeast Asia had a strong interest in sports and were also more skilled. Under the leadership of Professor Ma Dehan, they often won championships in the city sports meets. When the situation in the Burma battlefield became tense, Kunming was threatened by air raids. Not only did extracurricular activities on campus become silent as a result, but the time for going to school was also changed to mornings and evenings. With several alarms a day, the emotions of teachers and students were quite uneasy. After the arrival of American troops in China, hundreds of students from the Associated University served as translators. Later, they responded to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's call and enthusiastically joined the Youth Army. The spirit of the Associated University was once again invigorated. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the country still faced many difficulties. The Associated University also had many troubles. The most prominent was the "Kunming Student Movement." In the past half year, students of the Associated University were still often seen in the city acting as newspaper boys, distributing or selling their own propaganda. The Dean of Students of the school, Cha Liangzhao, felt "wanting to cry but having no tears" at this point!</p>
<p>Three Standing Committee Members, Close as Siblings</p>
<p>The Associated University began its operations in Kunming on "May Fourth" in 1938 and concluded its operations in Kunming on "May Fourth" in 1946. Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University had different histories and different academic styles, but they were able to support each other through hardships for eight years, cooperating seamlessly. This must be attributed to the faculty and staff of the Associated University, especially the three leaders – Jiang Menglin, Mei Yi-qi, and Zhang Boling. Some people regard the Associated University as a large family, and the three standing committee members as three siblings. Standing Committee Member Jiang handled diplomacy, Standing Committee Member Mei managed domestic affairs, and Standing Committee Member Zhang was stationed in the accompanying capital, Chongqing, to handle liaison. Those who handled foreign affairs were open-minded, and those who managed domestic affairs were able to consolidate. They advised each other and complemented each other. Although Peking University was the cradle of the "May Fourth" spirit, the newly born Associated University was still like the large family before and after the "May Fourth" Movement, with inevitable contradictions between new and old ideas. When Standing Committee Member Jiang spoke to teachers and students, he mentioned Mr. Science first, and then Mr. Democracy. This was still the path that the "May Fourth" Movement strived for. Therefore, in this large family, even if there were those who "defied the consensus of the crowd and spoke frankly like a scholar," they were ultimately able to be inclusive, "agreeing without harming difference, and differing without harming agreement." The so-called spirit of the Associated University probably lies in this. The reason why the Associated University was able to harmonize for eight years without splitting up is probably due to this as well.</p>
<p>Through Wind and Rain, Ascending Steep Peaks</p>
<p>Speaking of the lives of the faculty and staff of the Associated University, in the past eight years, they were not walking on asphalt roads, watching the clouds with those who shared the nation's troubles, but were shouldering the same tasks as the soldiers, climbing steep peaks in wind and rain. Their so-called material livelihood, besides eating chalk dust, was mostly selling articles, writing, engraving seals, special lectures, or selling old clothes, or borrowing from relatives and friends. There were very few who had special solutions. Their so-called spiritual food, besides a portion of books surviving the disaster, sometimes could only be used as fruit to appreciate the relics of American military culture. Even if the professors felt that the pressure on their bodies and minds was too high in this situation, they rarely put down the teaching whip that served as a walking stick. Rather than living for today, they were moving forward for tomorrow. This also sufficiently demonstrates the spirit of the Associated University.</p>
<p>Monument Erected at the Time of Graduation</p>
<p>Regarding the spirit and life of the Associated University, what this reporter knows is brief and not detailed, so he can only provide a superficial report. On the day of the school's graduation, a monument was erected on the campus. The inscription was written by Professor Feng Youlan and can be considered a historical document. Here, we quote a passage from the monument inscription as a conclusion to this article, which reads:</p>
<p>"Grieving the southward crossing, we bid farewell to the palace walls. Stationed in Hengzhou, we parted again. Continuing the long march, we circled around steep mountains. Looking towards the Central Plains, blood was shed everywhere. Arriving at the distant border, we continued to lecture. With books lost, we used our tongues. Despite all the hardships, our feelings grew stronger. The shame of a thousand autumns has finally been avenged. Seeing the enemy, they vanished like smoke. Rising from the north, reaching to the south. Seeing the golden goblet, there is no more defect. Great unity, without collapse or break. The revival of the nation, continuing the great achievements of the past. The three schools, are brothers in order. As one body, like glued together. Sharing hardships, sharing joys. The joint mission is completed. The divine capital is restored, returning to Yan and Jie. With this stone, symbolizing unwavering integrity. Commemorating the auspicious celebration, telling future generations! (Sent from Kunming on May 7th)</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Warehouse: Allowing Materials to be Sealed Up and Rot, Many Refugees Grieve Over Lack of Food and Clothing</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 8th, by Tao</p>
<p>Recently, Zhenjiang, from all aspects, seems to be outwardly calm, but inwardly tense. Speaking of a time further back, it has been gradually mobilizing since the fire at the gunpowder depot of the Logistics Department. First, the time for curfews began to be brought forward, followed by intensified household checks, and now all important strongholds have been fortified. By late at night, the streets are deserted, and the river surface is under curfew, starting before dusk in the afternoon. No ships are allowed to dock. Yangzhou can be considered the gateway to Zhenjiang, and it is now also under intensified guard. Even refugees who previously had refugee certificates have now lost their validity and cannot enter the city gates. Ships coming from the north are only allowed to go to Wantou, where they must dock, be inspected, and then proceed on foot. This is not only the case for the National Army, but it is said that the Communist Army is also different from before. In the past, it seemed that people were allowed to pass freely, and carrying a few pieces of luggage was not a big problem. Now, however, it is not only impossible to bring luggage, but even some spare clothes require some persuasion. Sometimes, even a letter is on the list of prohibited items.</p>
<p>People Are Restless, Rumors Rise and Fall</p>
<p>Due to the above facts and movements, people with slightly simpler minds cannot help but panic. The situation has a feeling of "a storm is brewing." In fact, the defenses around Zhenjiang and Yangzhou are very solid. People who are oversensitive always end up troubling themselves. However, we cannot generalize and arbitrarily blame everything. That is because the rumors from the outside world have been particularly increasing in the past half month. Whether someone is deliberately spreading them is another matter. For example, the fire at the gunpowder depot was clearly due to the embers of a match igniting gasoline, resulting in a large explosion in the warehouse. However, rumors always believe that there must be a reason, and even believe that it was a planned action. A pistol was found on a refugee, and rumors say it was a light machine gun. Clearly there was only one, but rumors always say it was a large batch. Such rumors, people in Zhenjiang are certainly unsure, and they have even been spread to Shanghai. Several newspapers have even telegraphed, instructing reporters stationed in Zhenjiang to investigate seriously. In fact, it is basically just that one thing, where else could there be anything? However, once it reaches a certain point in time, it will dissipate like the wind, collapsing without being attacked.</p>
<p>Nantong and Yangzhou, The Situation Remains Peaceful</p>
<p>A few days ago, the situation in Nantong was once tense, but after a few days, it turned from danger to safety. This is because the Communist Army often talks about these places in their propaganda, and it has always been the case. After a long period of peace, the sudden news of tension in Tongzhou cannot but attract attention. Especially Yangzhou, because in today's Grand Canal line, the only remaining one is this one county of Yangzhou. Plus, less than ten miles from Yangzhou is the front line of the Communist Army. The people of Zhenjiang care about the problem of Yangzhou even more than they care about the safety of Zhenjiang. According to rumors from people who have come, Nantong is now as quiet as usual, and the defenses of Yangzhou are also very strong. However, it has troubled the general refugees. Now, it is difficult to get convenience everywhere, and it has become a situation where the good and bad are not distinguished. Without a shop guarantee, it is impossible to enter the city. All the ships from Gaoyou and other counties in northern Jiangsu mostly take Yangzhou as their destination. Now that traffic is obstructed, they must dock and disembark passengers more than ten miles away. As for transporting goods, it is even more out of the question now.</p>
<p>However, although the refugees are so struggling with food and clothing, the warehouses of materials sealed by the government are allowed to rot naturally. It is truly heartbreaking to speak of. There are more than a hundred warehouses of enemy and puppet materials received in Zhenjiang, both large and small. Among them, the main eighteen have been sealed since last year until now, which is nearly half a year or more. The Logistics Department has only recently completed the inspection, with the items being more than 33,000 kilograms of barley, more than 10,000 kilograms of wheat bran, more than 20,000 kilograms of soybeans, more than 3,000 kilograms of refined rice, more than 20,000 kilograms of glutinous rice, more than 4,000 kilograms of biscuits, more than 19,000 kilograms of millet, and more than 34,000 kilograms of salt. Unfortunately, these huge numbers have been largely ruined by the words "mold and rot". After mold and rot, they are equivalent to becoming a waste product, with no use whatsoever. There are also clothing and miscellaneous items, which have also rotted due to dampness from being sealed for a long time. From the outside, they still seem to be not bad, but in reality, there is a loss of more than 70%. If these materials had been taken out earlier to provide relief to refugees, how practical and essential it would have been! However, until now, would it be better to let the sealed materials rot, and never come to a prior agreement to handle things, what can be done about it?</p>
<p>Relief Association Requests Allocation for Relief</p>
<p>The Post-War Relief Association of the counties of northern Jiangsu in Zhenjiang has specifically submitted a praiseworthy memorial requesting that the sealed materials be allocated for the relief of refugees. From this memorial, we can see the current situation of northern Jiangsu on the one hand, and the tragic state of the refugees on the other. The original text is:</p>
<p>"We, the Post-War Relief Association of the counties of northern Jiangsu, have jointly formed an organization to assist the service agencies of Jiangsu Province in handling the relief work for refugees from northern Jiangsu. Recently, we have continued to hear from refugees from northern Jiangsu that the Communist Army is more destructive to northern Jiangsu than floods and fierce beasts. Since the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference, the situation has become even more severe, with persecution of gentry, coercion of able-bodied men, killing of intellectuals, and confiscation of land and livestock. In their search for food, there is the "eating-up team." In their destruction of houses, there is the "sweeping-clean team." In their elimination of dissidents, there is the "assassination team." In their entertainment of soldiers, there is the "women's team." In their restriction of food and prohibition of movement, there are the "smell-searching team" and the "patrol team." All able-bodied men of appropriate age are enlisted as militiamen or logistics teams to be used by them, and young children are formed into children's teams for strict training. Every household has no grain left, and everyone is homeless, with no place to find shelter. In the villages and towns occupied by the Communist Army, every day one hears the sound of gongs resounding through the clouds, implementing their poisonous tactics of struggle, forcing tenants to struggle against landlords, workers to struggle against bosses, shop assistants to struggle against shop owners, workers to struggle against factory owners, and hooligans to struggle against intellectuals, even to the point of inciting sons to struggle against fathers, wives to struggle against husbands, younger brothers to struggle against elder brothers, and younger sisters to struggle against elder sisters, resulting in death in serious cases and imprisonment in light cases. Their intention is to thoroughly break down social organization and the family system, making sure that land is confiscated for public ownership, the young and strong are drafted into the army, and the old and weak are left to die.</p>
<p>Today's so-called "Liberated Zone" is, when looking up, as if a killing intent shines brightly, and when looking down, it is like a plague god densely spreading. Considering that the righteous people of each county, under this unprecedented disaster, do not hesitate to give up their lives and escape from danger, thus separated from their homeland, resources are cut off, drifting in foreign lands, with no food or shelter, originally hoping that the banners would point north and they would return home one day, but the news is constantly dismal, and the date of return is uncertain, involving major military and national plans, how dare we make wild hopes. However, as refugees from all counties flock in, and the distribution of materials by relief agencies is like a drop in the bucket, some refugees still have sighs of regret. According to the province's receipt of enemy and puppet materials, sealed for use, the number is very large, enough to be used for relief of refugees, and the relief materials brought by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, piled up waiting to be released, are also not in the minority. If a few percent can be allocated to provide relief, then the thousands of refugees in northern Jiangsu will feel the grace of re-creation, and from then on, the people's morale will be restored and the kindness will be remembered for generations."</p>

<h3>The Complaint of the Righteous People</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: We are over a thousand displaced "righteous" people who have been recognized by the government for our contributions to the war effort. We have a few words and request that your esteemed newspaper allocate some space to publish them.</p>
<p>When the war of resistance began, both the government and the public, all patriots, including vendors and laborers, contributed money and effort to support the war. We followed the government, traveled thousands of miles, abandoned our families and businesses, and were willing to sacrifice everything, ultimately laying the foundation for victory. It cannot be said that we common people made a complete contribution, but compared to those who clung to life, feared death, acted perversely, and recognized the enemy as their father – the collaborators – we can be considered "slightly more satisfactory."</p>
<p>It has been ten months since the victory. All enemy and puppet assets have been seized, and the government has returned to the capital a few days ago. We ignorant common people have also been sent back home for free. However, there are still many people who cannot return home due to "poverty" and "chaos" and are gathering in various ports, "leaving everything to fate." A group of pitiful creatures who survived the war with great difficulty, though fortunate enough to be taken in and provided with food and lodging by the government, feel that spending our days in idleness, we are wasting public resources and squandering our time. Unexpectedly, recently, the relief authorities have announced a plan for on-site dispersal. The implication is that such common people are neither fit to be pillars of "nation-building" nor possess the knowledge of "democracy" to contribute to national affairs. It would be best to let us live and die on our own, and let the matter drop.</p>
<p>Although we have survived the calamity and endured hardship, recalling the enemy's aircraft and artillery bombardment day and night, we still have the courage to fight for survival. Is it true that after returning victorious, we will be abandoned by the government without seeking a way to live? If a dispersal order is issued or an expulsion order is given, at most, a few armed military police will be sent to enforce it.</p>
<p>In short, we are the sand and mud that supported the war of resistance. We risked our lives to earn the title of "righteous." Although we are not qualified to ride in cars, eat fancy food, or enjoy the inherent rights of citizens in a powerful nation, we have the right to demand that the government take both temporary and permanent measures to help us, a group of common people who have suffered from the war, are homeless, and have no ability to find work, for the sake of human survival and natural desire. For the reasons mentioned above, on April 30th, we reported to the Shanghai Branch of the Overseas Chinese Second Reception Center, requesting that the relief authorities take the following measures for us: (1) Please issue a living allowance of 10,000 yuan per person, because the center only provides food, lodging, and transportation. Other necessities, such as haircuts, bathing, shoes, and socks, are not provided. As a result, most people have long hair, dirty bodies, bare feet, and cracked skin, living in extreme hardship. Therefore, we request that a subsidy be issued to solve the above problems. (2) Request the establishment of literacy classes for school-age children, a library, a sports ground (the land is available), a club, a barbershop, a bathhouse, an obstetrics ward, and wards for acute and infectious diseases. (3) Request a separate investigation of each person's knowledge and abilities, to provide individual job introductions, or collective production. Mr. Editor, are these requests reasonable? However, since submitting the report, even though the organization is nearby, it has been delayed without approval. A few days ago, we sent representatives to make a request in person, but the bigwigs of the department refused to condescend to meet with us, and only a "specialist" gave a vague reply. After gathering to discuss, we wanted to take action to achieve our demands, but we also considered the dignity of national law and dared not be too extreme. After thinking it over, we can only write this article, requesting your esteemed newspaper to publish it quickly, to awaken the attention and assistance of the authorities and society, in the hope that we, a group of abandoned waste materials, can find a way to make a living and benefit both the public and ourselves, and avoid falling into crime and harming society.</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: We wholeheartedly welcome you to take the time to inspect and see if we have exaggerated. Please also ask the government on our behalf, what do they intend to do with us? Sincerely, Representatives of the Righteous People of the Second and Third Reception Centers for Overseas Chinese in the Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration: Zhang Hanchao, Chen Weiru, Li Shangxun, Li Liang, Xia Rixu, Zhou Rongcheng, Cui Yaodong, Cao Shiquan, Liu Zizhou, Lu Zhizhen, Wang Fengming, Zhang Futang, Wu Jinhai, Du Yaozhang.</p>
<p>Additional Charges on Train Fares</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: Recently, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway announced the launch of a reserved-seat express train, with an additional 5,000 yuan fee per ticket for seat reservations. The passenger fare is also higher than the recently set express train price. For example, from Suzhou to Shanghai, the total cost of a first-class ticket, including the reservation fee, is over 13,000 yuan, and a second-class ticket is over 9,400 yuan. There are no third-class tickets. Compared to the prices before the increase, this is more than thirteen times higher. The term "reservation fee" is incomprehensible to the general public. Does this mean that passengers have no right to a seat at all when riding the train? If the reason is passenger congestion or the prohibition of small-scale smuggling, then each carriage has a specified number of passengers. Why not strictly regulate the number of tickets sold at each station, or add more trains? Moreover, since the overall freight transport is still not smooth, smugglers, if there is profit to be made, will continue to pursue their interests, even if the penalty is increased hundreds of times. If the Railway Bureau's expenditures are insufficient, then the increase in passenger fares will affect the price of all goods. Even if the salaries of staff members are increased, with the prices of goods and train fares rising in tandem, I fear that the Railway Bureau's income and expenses will never be balanced. Those who are responsible for this will still feel the difficulty of life. The government has repeatedly emphasized stabilizing prices as an urgent policy after returning to the capital. Why does the Railway Bureau have this superficial solution that does not address the root cause? Sincerely, Feng Yi.</p>
<p>Condensed Milk Rationed to Patients</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: I am a poor and sick civil servant. Suddenly, I heard that the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) had fish liver oil and condensed milk rationed to patients. I was naturally overjoyed, so I went to the Fourth Tuberculosis Clinic on Qiqi Road to apply according to the regulations. I originally thought it was completely free, but when registering, I learned that I still had to pay a registration fee of 500 yuan and a fluoroscopy fee of 3,000 yuan. When receiving the fish liver oil, I also had to pay a bottle fee of 1,000 yuan. Mr. Editor, don't you think this method greatly deviates from the original intention of relief? Six cans of condensed milk and two pounds of fish liver oil are worth no more than 10,000 yuan at market prices. Now I have to pay a price of 4,500 yuan. Isn't this just selling at a discount? I naturally do not object to registering and examining when applying, but the clinic's charging standards are too high! Because according to the regulations, those receiving rations must be examined once a month. For the benefit of myself and other patients, I hope that Mr. Editor will reveal this matter in your newspaper and ask the responsible authorities to review it. It would be best to cancel the procedure of monthly checkups in the future to reduce the burden on patients. If it cannot be canceled, I hope to reduce the charging standards as much as possible. Sincerely, Li Tongren.</p>
<p>After the Youth Army is Demobilized</p>
<p>Your newspaper reported that the Youth Army will be demobilized at the end of this (May). In the humble opinion of this reader, it would be best if the authorities trained some of the Youth Army comrades to become outstanding Chinese police officers. Currently, the general police force has a lower level of knowledge (and some have even served in the puppet regime). Regarding the academic qualifications of police officers, I think a health police officer should fully understand all aspects of hygiene knowledge, and a household registration police officer should fully understand the meaning of household registration and Baojia system. At the same time, I hope that the Youth Army, who are ambitious and capable in nation-building, will all take on this great and noble task! Sincerely, Xu Yuanzhang.</p>

<h3>Talking About "Daylight Saving Time"</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Daylight Saving Time is a request to advance the standard time by one hour. The so-called standard time is based on the time of each 7.5-degree longitude zone east and west of Greenwich, England. Each 15 degrees east longitude is one hour earlier, and each 15 degrees west longitude is one hour later. That is, each 15 degrees of longitude from Greenwich is a time zone. For example, the area of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Shaanxi, and east of Jiuquan in Gansu, located at 105 degrees east longitude, belongs to the Longshu Time Zone, which is seven hours earlier than Greenwich. Jiang, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi, located at 120 degrees east longitude, belong to the Central Plains Time Zone, which is eight hours earlier than Greenwich. That is, the clocks in Shanghai and Nanjing are one hour earlier than those in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Xi'an. In addition, China has the Changbai Time, which is one hour earlier than the Central Plains Time, and the Huizang Time and Kunlun Time, which are one hour and two hours later than the Central Plains Time, respectively. Because summer days are long and nights are short, advancing the time by one hour can take advantage of daylight and save on lighting. This idea was first proposed in Parliament in 1908 by Englishman William Willett, called the Daylight Saving Bill. He proposed that every Sunday in April, the clocks should be advanced by 20 minutes, for a total of 80 minutes at the end of the month. Every Sunday in September, the clocks should be set back by 20 minutes, for a total of 80 minutes at the end of the month to return to the original time. Unfortunately, it was rejected by Parliament. Willett then proposed it again in 1909, and again in 1911, but all were rejected. Willett was depressed by the failure of his idea and died of grief.</p>
<p>During the First World War, Germany, in order to save resources, first adopted this system in 1916. The results were remarkable. That year, it saved as much as 200 million marks. Later, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, and other countries followed suit. The Soviet Union also adopted it in 1930. As for the United Kingdom, also due to the benefits and the trend of the times, it changed its previous stubborn attitude and immediately adopted this system. But I wonder what Mr. Willett thought under the nine springs?</p>
<p>The way the United Kingdom implements this system is to advance the time by one hour from 2:00 AM on the third Sunday of April (April 16th), because at this time people are mostly resting, and it is very appropriate to move the clocks forward. After the summer, at the autumnal equinox, the day and night are almost equal, so at 2:00 AM on the first Sunday of October (October 8th), the time is set back by one hour to return to the original time.</p>
<p>However, although Daylight Saving Time is good, it is not beneficial to places near the equator. Because the length of day and night in the four seasons varies with the latitude. The higher the latitude, the longer the daytime in summer. The equator, located in the middle of the earth, has a latitude of zero. The sun during the day and the moon and stars at night are all above the horizon for 12 hours every day, and below the horizon for 12 hours. They rise and fall, and the length of day and night is equal throughout the year. There is no need to implement Daylight Saving Time. If it were to be adopted, people would have to get up in the dark of night. Not only would they not be able to take advantage of daylight, but they would also waste lighting. It would be a purely self-inflicted disturbance, which is far from the original intention of Daylight Saving Time. At the poles – places with a latitude of 90 degrees north or south – half the year is day and half the year is night. The sun, which is above the horizon for half a year during the day, and the moon and stars, which are above the horizon for half a year at night, circle at the same height. For the half-year that is day, the sun is above the horizon in a circular motion for 24 hours every day. There is no phenomenon of the sun setting as in the middle and low latitudes where we live. The height of the sun above the horizon is also different every day during the half-year that is day. The half-year of daylight and the half-year of night exchange to come to the horizon. Once they come, they occupy the throne for half a year, just like the half-day and half-night in our middle and low latitudes rotate to come to the horizon. This kind of circular motion is centered on a point in the northern sky – the north celestial pole – called the daily motion of celestial bodies. At the poles, its trajectory is on the horizon every day for half a year. In the middle and low latitudes, half a day is above the horizon and half a day is below the horizon, resulting in the phenomenon of celestial bodies rising in the east and setting in the west. The rising and setting of the sun is the result of the sun's daily motion. Therefore, it is not advisable to adopt Daylight Saving Time at the poles. At 66 degrees north latitude, at midnight of the summer solstice, the sun can be seen on the horizon. Shanghai is located at about 31.2 degrees north latitude. In summer, the average length of daytime is about 14 hours. Before 5:00 AM, the east is already dawning. At this time, getting up not only allows people to take advantage of daylight and go to bed early to save lighting, but also to immerse themselves in the fresh air of the morning and enjoy the beauty of nature. Both body and mind are happy, which greatly increases work efficiency and promotes good health.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom is located between 50 and 60 degrees north latitude, and it is very appropriate to implement Daylight Saving Time throughout the country. China has a vast territory, from the Tuansha Islands at 10 degrees north latitude to Mohe County in Heilongjiang Province at 53.5 degrees north latitude. Therefore, it is most appropriate to implement Daylight Saving Time in the central and northern regions. However, along the south coast and the areas south of it, which are quite close to the equator and have very low latitudes, implementing Daylight Saving Time does not conform to the original intention of fully utilizing daylight and saving lighting. This is from an astronomical perspective. However, it is inconvenient to use two different time systems in one country administratively, so it is better to adopt it nationwide. From May 1st to September 30th of last year, the time was advanced by one hour, and Daylight Saving Time was implemented nationwide. The results were excellent. Now summer is coming again. I hope that this system will not be forgotten. Even if the authorities issue a notice to implement it nationwide, individual agencies and schools can also enjoy its benefits by adopting it individually. Before the nationwide implementation of Daylight Saving Time last year, Central University had already implemented it, as an example of individual adoption. The purpose of this article is to introduce some excellent systems, and I hope that the people of the country will not miss the opportunity and adopt them immediately.</p>
<p>Inventions</p>
<h3>Constantly Changing</h3>
<p>— Steel Man</p>
<p>The United States, with its highly developed material civilization, constantly sees the emergence of new and ingenious inventions to enhance the happiness of the people. After the end of the war, scientists and inventors are even more dedicated to researching how to benefit the people. There are indeed improvements from time to time, and inventions daily.</p>
<p>Spiral Museum - A spiral building completed in New York last year was designed by the famous new-style architect Frank Wright, for the collection of world-famous paintings by Sharon Guggenheim. Although the building is twelve stories high, there is not a single horizontal floor slab, only spiral extending galleries, the diameter gradually increasing from the ground floor to the top floor, the roof is built into a spherical shape, completely made of glass, the walls and exterior are decorated with paint, complete air conditioning allows various famous paintings not to use glass or other simple covers; special roof walls are impermeable to heat and sound. When tourists enter, they clear dust from their clothes and hats in a room with dust removal equipment, and then visit the spiral gallery. The annex on the right is equipped with an elevator, so that visitors do not have to reach any floor through the gallery? In the ground floor house is the manager's office.</p>
<p>Projector serves patients reading books - Special miniature films previously used exclusively for delivering home letters to overseas soldiers have now been used in hospitals for patients to read books; useful magazines, interesting novels, jokes, are all filmed and placed in automatic projectors, a patient lying in bed or in an "iron lung" who cannot move, can use his hands or head to turn on three switches; when the first one is turned on, the projector emits light, shining on the ceiling screen; the second switch makes a page of the book appear on the screen, and when the stone is finished, he moves it again, and the second page is projected; the third switch makes the photo retreat, so that the patient can reread any page.</p>
<p>Automatic clothes dryer - Weston recently specially made an automatic clothes dryer, which can replace the method of drying clothes manually with an iron, the clothes only need to be put into the box, close the box door, turn on the switch, and the electric mechanical in the box will dry the moisture of the clothes, and it can automatically stop when the work is finished.</p>
<p>Heating tube - Usually in household fireplaces, part of the heat scene is taken away by the exhaust smoke, if a tortuous tube is placed in the fireplace, so that the smoke must pass through the tube wall before being discharged; the lower end of the tube is fanned into cold air with a fan, and the heat comes out from the upper end of the tube, and the upper end can be connected to the tube again, so that it can be connected to any place where heat is needed.</p>
<p>Automatic vending counter - New York's "Marga" company applies automatic vending machines for widespread sale, originally a special "refined food" for the US military, a package of food flashes when it is removed from the rack, and a number is added.</p>
<p>Light yacht - Grumman, a factory specializing in the manufacture of naval aircraft during the war, recently made a aluminum yacht, about ten feet long and weighing thirty-eight pounds, so convenient that anyone can lift it, this is as convenient as using war-damaged aircraft to make fast cars.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Talking About Hope</h3>
<p>— Shen Yungang</p>
<p>I once heard someone say: "A person's life is like a car that never stops, it is only allowed to move forward, not backward."</p>
<p>If this statement is true, then I have a good analogy for the abstract noun "hope": what should I compare it to? Compare it to the power that drives the car forward.</p>
<p>The so-called power that drives the car forward means: if it is a carriage, it is the donkey and horse; if it is a tram, it is electricity; if it is a train or car, it is steam.</p>
<p>The car cannot move forward without power. In other words, life is the same. Lacking hope means lacking the courage to "live on"!</p>
<p>I remember there was a story in the past about a stonemason in a village who worked hard all year round. He kept chiseling stones, "dang, dang, dang". Except for sleeping and eating, all the time was spent on work.</p>
<p>One day, an innocent child approached him and asked curiously, "Why do you work so hard all the time?"</p>
<p>He said annoyedly, "Huh! Hard work can make money."</p>
<p>The child asked again, "What's the use of making money?"</p>
<p>"Making money can maintain life."</p>
<p>"What happens after maintaining life?"</p>
<p>"Kid!" the stonemason said resentfully, "After maintaining life, I can still chisel stones."</p>
<p>"What happens after chiseling stones?" the annoying child asked again.</p>
<p>"??!!" The stonemason couldn't help but be stunned.</p>
<p>Yes, the stonemason realized his own pity at this moment: work, eat, work, eat... until death.</p>
<p>The next day, there was no sound of stonemasonry in this village.</p>
<p>This is a very simple story. It tells us the importance of hope to life. People who have lost hope cannot generate the power to work, just like a car that has to break down due to lack of power.</p>
<p>A Spanish poet said: "Hope is like a prostitute, who likes to wink and seduce people, to seduce and bewitch life."</p>
<p>That's right, hope is a restless woman, she likes to be flattering, to seduce people, to lead people on the right path, and also to bewitch people to embark on the wrong path.</p>
<p>Many people shed blood for it, many people leave a good name for it, and many people leave a bad name for it. The point to pay attention to here is that all hopes must take the happiness of the masses of mankind as the standard. The distinction between leaving a good name for eternity and leaving a bad name for ten thousand years lies here.</p>
<p>Be careful, friends: has the bewitching and evil hope around you merged with you and reconciled you?</p>
<p>"Hope", this guy, also made many people crazy, many people cried for it, many people were too sad to live, and occasionally many people held on to a hope that could never be fulfilled, and wrongly killed themselves, like Li Bai, who got drunk, wanted to fish for the moon in the water, and blindly lost his life.</p>
<p>The so-called hope that cannot be fulfilled is excessive "extravagant hope". How boring and wasteful it is for hope to become "extravagant", and over time, it finally becomes disappointment.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart." You must know that "death of the heart" means losing hope.</p>

<h3>Good News from Pudong</h3>
<p>— Hansheng</p>
<p>According to recent reports, there are plans to implement a bridge over the Huangpu River. This is nothing less than good news for the people of Pudong and good news for the people of Shanghai! Because Shanghai's geographical situation is special during the eight years of the war of resistance, forming a distorted prosperity. Even housing has become a panic, which is really "too few monks and too little porridge." Although it is said that foreign countries will transport mobile houses, one day this excessive population will make it impossible to place mobile houses in a serious stage.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the place where national industry and commerce gather, and the country's economic center is also here. Therefore, it is a serious social problem for the people of Shanghai to have no houses to live in, which affects the development of industrial and commercial economy, and the country will also suffer. Therefore, the authorities</p>
<p>Bridge, so that the suburbs and Shanghai urban area can be integrated, to realize the "Greater Shanghai"</p>
<p>A plan will eventually have a day to start construction, and if construction starts, there will definitely be a day to succeed. If it is realized: we can pass this interesting bridge, overlooking the waves of the Huangpu River, watching the ships shuttle under the high belly of the bridge, we may have to shout!</p>
<p>Once the bridge is built, Pudong's fertile fields will become the base for factories, and the black smoke from the chimneys will dance in the air in Pudong, as if congratulating the laying of a strong cornerstone on the road to national construction. Pudong has a lot of open space, and some of the citizens of Shanghai can also be spared to come here. With the bridge, are you still afraid of inconvenience? "Long live Pudong!" I will say this to the region.</p>
<h3>Human Honor Ninety-Eight</h3>
<p>The reason why humans are praised as the spirit of all things is,</p>
<p>Because· they can know· how they have lived,</p>
<p>how they are living,</p>
<p>how they will live, but· some people, cannot know· how they have lived, how they are living, how they will live...</p>
<p>living. A non-human life.</p>
<p>May I ask: The honor of humans being the "spirit of all things"</p>
<p>Will it be cancelled?</p>
<h3>Social Services</h3>
<p>Mr. Yao Zhang asks: I have just arrived in Shanghai from Beiping and intend to study at Fudan University. However, as this is my first time in Shanghai, I am unfamiliar with the place and people. I would be grateful if your column could provide guidance on the following questions: (1) How many colleges and departments does Fudan University have? (2) Where is it located during the war? (3) Is there any connection between the Shanghai and Chongqing campuses, and what is the current situation?</p>
<p>[Answer from Zhang Yi, President of National Fudan University] Our university moved to Beibei Xia Ba, Chongqing during the war, occupying 400 acres with school buildings. It is divided into five colleges: Arts, Sciences, Law, Commerce, and Agriculture, under which there are eighteen departments. The College of Arts has five departments: Chinese, Foreign Languages, Journalism, Education, and History; the College of Science has four departments: Mathematics and Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Civil Engineering; the College of Law has four departments: Law (including Judicial Group), Political Science, Economics, and Sociology; the College of Commerce has three departments: Accounting, Banking, and Statistics; the College of Agriculture has two departments: Agronomy and Horticulture; there are also affiliated specialized courses in Statistics and Tea Industry. Recently, it has been restored and will be merged with the Shanghai Supplementary Department and moved back to the original site in Jiangwan for classes.</p>
<p>Li Zeduan, Cai Fubang, et al. ask: Taiwan lacks teachers, and we are willing to serve in Taiwan. What are the procedures for teaching in Taiwan?</p>
<p>[Answer from Zhang Yiqu]: This matter concerns the education administration of Taiwan Province. Please write directly to the Education Department of the Executive Office of the Taiwan Provincial Government in Taipei for inquiries.</p>
<p>Zuo Ming asks: Does graduation from the Chinese-French University's Specialized Pharmacy Course qualify for the first requirement of the self-funded student examination?</p>
<p>[Answer from Zhang Yiqu]: After reviewing the first requirement for self-funded student examination qualifications, which is "graduates of universities or independent colleges," all graduates of universities not controlled by the enemy or puppets are eligible to take the self-funded student examination.</p>

<p>Our letter published: We were surprised to see the letter from the elderly residents of the Bao'an Nursing Home to people from all walks of life published in your column on May 3. We have checked and confirmed that the case of the merger of the institution with the Old People's Home and their continued support was previously reported to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for approval. Subsequently, a small number of restless elderly residents, incited by others, came out in opposition. The Bureau has also sent personnel to investigate and clarify the matter. Fearing that readers may not understand the truth and misunderstand, we have specially requested that this letter be published to dispel public doubts. Shanghai Charity Group.</p>
<h3>Traitors Sing the "Song of Hope"</h3>
<p>— Yang Zhimin</p>
<p>It is said that a group of cultural traitors in the Tilanqiao Prison today deeply regret their past deeds and are filled with sorrow. Sometimes, they reveal their emotions and sing the "Song of Hope" composed by Montov. It is said that the melody is very mournful. (The lyrics of the song are transcribed below.)</p>
<p>Open – the doors of the prison!</p>
<p>Return my sunlight!</p>
<p>Return my black-eyed maiden!</p>
<p>Return my chestnut horse.</p>
<p>Maiden of youth!</p>
<p>I want to kiss you freely!</p>
<p>I want to ride my horse like the wind, galloping into the wilderness!</p>
<p>But – the prison is tall, the heavy prison doors are locked.</p>
<p>The black-eyed maiden is far away, in her own home.</p>
<p>The warm horse, walking in the green fields, without reins, is leisurely, swaying its tail in the wind.</p>
<p>Only – I alone have no joy, surrounded by thick, high walls.</p>
<p>The shadow of the wall lamp, the dying spark, flickers sadly and weakly.</p>
<p>All that can be heard is, outside the prison doors, stepping on the solitude of the night, the unanswered night camp, the steady, solemn sound of footsteps.</p>
