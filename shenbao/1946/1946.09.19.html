<h3>王部長談對外政策　闡明我國政府立場　本平等互惠原則訂商約</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕中宣部外記者招待會，十八日下午四時半於國貨大樓六棋國際宣傳處會客室循例舉行，出席彭部長學沛，王部長世杰，劉决長錯，曾處長虛白，中宜部顧問貝爾及中外記者共四十餘人。首由彭部長發言，介紹甫自巴黎歸來之王外長與記者見面後，王氏起立略稱：今日與各記者晤談，倍感愉快，希望渠所問答諸點對各記者能有助益，旋即就記者所提各項問題逐一答覆，茲誌主要問答如後：</p>
<p>問，（一）中國將來在對外關係上，是否仍以「門戶開放」爲原則，治外法權業已廢止，尊意是否以爲「門戶開放」亦將因之而有變更？（二）中國在與美·英·法·蘇曁其他國家舉行商務談判時，「最惠國」觀念是否普通適用？是否某某特定國家將獲得特殊權利？</p>
<p>答，本人對於此兩問題，擬合併答復，中國政府之旣定政策，爲盡力運用外國資本及技術，以發展中國資源及提高中國民衆之生活水準，此即我國最近對於商業公司問題及有關事項立法之指導原則·中國政府對於將與吾人締結商的之國家，均擬予以最惠國待遇，享受此項待遇之條件，厥爲互惠。中國在其領土上任何部份，不擬對任何外國採取任何差別待遇，倘若此種態度可認爲門戶開放政策，則所謂門戶開放者，實爲中國本身之政策，然吾人必須鄭重聲明，關於此類經濟商業事項，中國所受國際之拘束，必須以中國所曾參加之公約條約或其他協定爲限，正與其他事項同。</p>
<p>問，已黎廿一國和會，是否將成爲將來對德，日和會之藍本？</p>
<p>答，予意在程序及和會組織方面，巴黎和會大體上將爲對德，對日和會之模型。在實質問題方面，對德，對日之和的，勢必有若干差異，但聯合國對一切和的之基本態度，應爲以協調之決心，求得公平而持久之和平。</p>
<p>日指作賠償資產　我應得優越比例</p>
<p>問，將來對德，日和的，中國所主張者是否係强硬抑或係寬大之條款？</p>
<p>答，中國之態度，可簡述如下：在軍事方面，例如防止黷武主義之復活，和約中必須設立十分有效之保障，在經濟及政治方面，和的之條款如果過於嚴酷，必爲戰敗國反動勢力所利用，而使戰敗國內之民主和平勢力不易抬頭，吾人必須避免此種情勢，在任何情形之下，和的不可採取報復主義。</p>
<p>問，日本賠償的題有何進展，中國向日要求賠償之目標爲何？</p>
<p>答，　重委員會對日本賠償問題之初步討論尙未完竣，各會員國現正磋商設立一處置此事之專門機構，至於中國之要求，本人此時僅願聲明，吾人抗戰最久，損失亦最重，對於日本在國內國外可以指作賠償之資產，自應取得優越之此例。彼茨俎宣言，對於日本貽償問題之一般原則，曾有所規定，中國已予接受，日本賠償總額，將依照此原則而決定，中國並無意使日本經濟永遠處於破產及奴役地位。本人相信，聯合國中任何其他國家，亦無此舟意願。</p>
<p>使用旅順軍港　依照條例辦理</p>
<p>問，大連之現狀如何？中國政府接收大迎市政有何進展？蘇軍是否仍佔領大連？中蘇雙方己否商定蘇軍撤退之確期</p>
<p>答。中國政府尙未接收大迎·關於此事，尙無詳細情報。</p>
<p>問，美國請求在哈爾濱設領本館，政府與中共方面是否已有商討。</p>
<p>答。中國政府對美國　在哈爾濱設立總領事館，已表示同意。</p>
<p>問，對於旅順爲中蘇共同使用之軍港一點，中國是否將堅決主張其條約上之權利？</p>
<p>答，中國自將依照中蘇同盟條的之規定辦理。</p>
<p>問，據中央社訊，中國政府已派遣正式代表往漢城，充駐韓國美軍佔領區代表，此人用何名義？韓國蘇軍佔領區內中國人民之地位若何？目前中國政府是否與蘇聯代表商討派遣中國代表前往韓國蘇軍佔領區？</p>
<p>答，中國政府在朝鮮美國佔領區內之漢城，將設立總領事館，至於蘇聯所統治區域，吾人擬於最近之將來，向蘇聯常局商洽此事。</p>
<p>我對越南政策　願見自主獨立</p>
<p>問，本年二月廿八日所訂立之中·法新的，是否將成爲今後中法邦交之良好基礎？</p>
<p>答，然。</p>
<p>問，中國對越南之基本政策如何？自去年蔣主席發表聲明，主張越南自治與獨立後，中國政府之態度是否已有變更？</p>
<p>答，吾人對於越南之態度，並無變更，中國人民與政府，願見各殖民地之人民在相當時期內實現其自主獨立之願望。法國政府及越盟代表間之談判，已有進步，吾人聞之，殊引爲慰。</p>
<p>問，中法間是否有早日訂立商的之希望？</p>
<p>答，中國不久將與法國政府開始談判。</p>
<p>問，王外長對皮杜爾外長在和會中之態度，有何意見？</p>
<p>答，在和會中，皮杜爾先生領導法國代表團，盡力减少和會所遭遇之困難皮杜爾先生之能力，値得欽佩。</p>
<p>我將贊援暹羅　使加入聯合國</p>
<p>問，退羅請求加人聯合國，中國是否贊成？</p>
<p>答，中國對於暹羅請求加人聯合國一事，願予以贊援。</p>
<p>問，中國是否贊成瓜分德國，抑或主張保存一聯邦制或統一之德國？</p>
<p>答，大西洋憲章中曾規定，應使各國人民自由選擇其本身所願支持之政體，吾人深信，此一原則即對過去敵國亦應適用，違反此項原則之一切解決方案，將不利於永久和平之建立。</p>

<p>〔本報甫京十八日電〕據權威人士稱：一般人觀察政局，均從形式方面推測，尤對三人會及五人會等之看法，認爲目前時局嚴重，戰事激烈，似應從立即停戰開始，實則吾人如放大眼光，中國問題決非軍事，而在政治，故如無條件立即停戰，令下後政治問題不獲解決，國內紛爭，仍不能遏止，以此應就治本之方法着意，從政治方面着手。某氏並稱：如正式硏討國是及開政協，則戰事又從何打起，某氏並認爲，共產黨方面拒絕參加非正式五人小組會，如同因噎廢食，倘能參加，必有成就，且必能達成停戰之目的·</p>

<p>大會開幕後，首待解決者爲主席問題，各小國以旣未參加和約起草，故對此點頗持異議對五國輪任主席辦法不贊同，有主張法爲地主，即由法任主席，蘇聯則認爲與舊金山聯合國會議不同，主張仍由五國輪任，法方對地主任主席一層，亦聲明須全體一致始肯祖任，最後仍決定由五國依法文字母先後輪任。次述及會議秩序，略謂：關於大會之表決，外長會議曾決定以三分之二之通過爲準，蘇方亦認討論聯合會憲章時，即係如此，但各小國則感覺恐慌，且認和會通過者將來尙須經過外長會議，故多主張用多敬表決制，如此爭執頗烈，最後因各方希望我提折衷案，本人（王自稱）乃提三分之二旣不易解決，採用多數制，則大會表決時　權者往往甚多，主張用十一票爲表決數，英方同時亦建議，用兩種方式表決，一方面用三分之二表決，一方面用十一票至十四票爲表決數，兩種結果均移送外長會議參攻，此與我所提者精神相同，會議時間，爲此竟耗去兩星期之多。至和會中所用語言，係英·法·蘇三種，我曾聲明保留將來對日和會須加川中文，因三種文字並用之故，會議中因此所耗時間，亦復不少。</p>
<p>和會爭執雖多　結果尚可樂觀</p>
<p>次述及此次和會精神，　　：會中爭執雖多，但以鑒於上次戰後所受敎訓及爲防止新戰爭之故，故結果尙可樂觀，如對義賠償，除英殖民地初提出要求十五萬萬鎊賠償，旋亦撤消，蘇方要求一萬萬美金外，英·美均聲明不索賠償，不要土地，南·希等受害甚大，但亦無大苛求，我國方面在拳亂時，義國向我所索賠償積三十五年，所付之數一美金三千萬元，此次對義雖未直接作戰，但間接所受義方之損害及影響甚大，惟爲扶持義大利能走上民主之路，故亦不計前嫌，無所需索。次述及義大利殖民地問題，外長會議對此尙未解決，但原則上亟需有所決定，如仿照以前國聯委任統治地辦法，因其未定期限，巳吿失敗，今後如照聯合國託治辦法，同時即應尊重民族自決原則，使將來能收良果，此事將來或須由外長會議或聯合國會議予以解決。最後述及和會結果之預測，略謂：形勢雖變化無端，但預測本年之內，當可簽訂未來對德，對日之和約，困難雖多，倘能認定民族自決之原則與保持德如被分裂和平將不可能之信念，則一切自易解決。此次和約簽訂後，國際空氣或有轉變，將來或可期於以獲得新的結論。</p>
<h3>英國一年以來　形勢已大改觀</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕長於茶會中報吿出席和會經過後，談及英國情形謂：英一年以來，形勢已大爲改觀，去年此日，英朝野各方對政治，經濟各方面均缺乏信心，經一年之節衣縮食，努力苦幹，自信心大爲增加·氣象已爲之一新。上月間英政府幷曾宣布，出口貿易數已恢復一九三九年之水準，工黨當政，自信必能達到民主政治之路。對印態度亦大異昔日，故印人對英感想亦大改變。次復答復記者詢問，（一）英，美對蘇關係，是否根本矛盾？王答：主義上固如此，但相信終可克服。（二）我海關近又添用外籍稅務司，是否受外力壓迫？王答，據所知幷無外力壓迫，且此項措施亦毫無拘束。（四）對華萊士演說作何感想？答，對此現尙無話可說。</p>

<h3>聯總遠東區大會　檢討行總運輸物資情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯總遠東區大會，昨假中國銀行四樓舉行，出席者有中，美，英，蘇，印，荷等十國之代表，我國代表蔣廷黻任主席。昨日下午，在原址召開不公開之小組會議，行總關於該小組中曾提出有關儲運之各種詳細數字。大會將於今午十一時一刻續開，預料此次大會今日常可結束</p>
<p>昨日大會中主要議題，爲（一）行總運輪救濟物資情形之檢討，（二）因戰事而琉亡在外之各團僑民之遣送問題。</p>
<p>關於行總運輸救濟物資情形，美國代表吉配屈律克指稱，聯總運華物資中，尙有百分之二十五擁塞於上海港口。吉氏謂，過去數月之中，內運物資僅十萬噸。聯總救濟計劃中擬撥付中國之物資，將續有一百五十萬噸之多，如以後運輸情形不予改善，則運輪此項物資，勢非十五個月不可。前次遠東區大會中所決定，提交聯總大會，將遠東區救濟延長期限之請求，已遭拒絕，聯總一切工作，至明年六月底即須全部終止，在此極短時期之中，如何設法補救，吉氏要求聯總駐華辦事處處長艾格頓加以說明。</p>
<p>艾氏當即答稱：在目前困難處境之下，淸除上海港口之工作，確已較前進步，彼深信在不久之將來，輸運必更可加速。聯總如因此而减少對華之接濟，實爲大可不必之舉。</p>
<p>艾氏旋請參加行總港口淸理委員會之聯總代表漢德氏報吿港口淸理情形，漢氏稱：出淸倉庫所以遲緩之主因，在於若干破舊不堪應用之笨重機器，堆積其中，搬運爲難，此等機器多係戰時剩餘物資，零件不全，無法裝配。按：行總執行長劉鴻生氏曾表示，擬將此項笨重機器廉價出售，俾倉庫能騰出地位，但迄無買主</p>
<p>關於遣送各國難民回國問題，首提遣送流亡在外之華僑返國辦法，聯總難民遣送局局長薩柏稱：遣送華僑難民返國，本月終必可開始辦理，日內即可抵滬之若干菲律賓政府官員，已允全力協助。英代表邢德女士稱：馬來及緬甸政府，亦願作遣送華僑之「試航」。薩柏繼稱：留華奧籍難民，已有二〇九九名歸國，此間並已接獲歐洲駐軍當局來電，准許彼等重返家園，但德國駐軍當局，則尙無此項表示，美代表當允將其意見轉達有關當局。蘇聯代表塞米那斯對遣送韓僑事，曾提議請駐韓美·蘇軍方派遣代表會同聯總辦理，當獲通過。並定於下次大會中，檢討韓境善後救濟情形。美代表曾提及菲律賓之善後救濟，因昨日菲代表未能出席，大會決定「敦請」菲代表務於下次大會時蒞會。</p>
<h3>行總允撥器材　修湘桂黔桂路</h3>
<p>〔中央社桂林十八日電〕湘桂鐵路街桂段及黔桂路柳（州）南（丹）段，自經敵人破壞後，迄未修復，桂省善救審議會，曾與桂善救分署洽商，轉請行總撥助器材，頃獲行總允准，該會特電呈政院交部，請迅飭兩路，立即動工修復。</p>

<h3>香港與九龍問題　應分作三個部份　外交界名宿對記者談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近數日來，收回香港之呼聲，又因我國政府於九龍城設治而甚囂塵上，市參議會中亦有人提出收回香港之要求。記者昨特走訪本市外交界某名宿，承將其私人之觀察見吿云：香港與九龍問題·實應分作三個部份：（一）九龍城向爲我國沿海防倭要地，城　堅固，隱成華南之重鎭，昔年與英人訂約之時，並未有放棄九龍城主櫂之明文規定，故此次我國設治，並無不合。（二）九龍租借地，係一八九八年北京條約中規定，由英國租借九十九年，抗戰期中，英政府爲對我國之英勇抗日表示欽敬起見，曾自動交還在華租界，秉此精神，似宜將過去中英間一切不平等之條約，皆予廢棄；惟當時簽訂新的，對九龍租借地之是否交　一點，並米確切規定，就英方解釋，似爲對九龍租借地之英國租借權，予以默認，甚至視爲事實上之重行確定。惟英方如確具增進山英友誼之誠意，則又何妨將此地區提前若十年交還原主乎？（三）香港之地位與九龍租借地又不相同，香港係英國之Crown　Colony，直屬英政府管轄，在香港出生之人民，皆有英國國籍，英政府之外交政策固一向重在現實性之運用，目光遠大，有時亦頗願在爭執巾作相當讓步，惟放棄香港之意義，等於放棄遠東，就目前之跡象視之，英國似未必願意出此，最近路透社記者稱，要求收回香港之舉爲「茶杯裏的風波」，或即相當反應一般英國人對此之態度也。</p>
<h3>港組民選政府　英商會提意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港十八日電〕港英商會昨向政府提供對民選政府組織之意見，其所建議民選政府職權及選民委員資格，比港督月前廣播之範圍限制更嚴。按建議外交，防務，港口，鐵路，郵政，海關，貿易，統制，船舶，課稅，財政審計，司法官及警察等，仍由皇家政府負責，民選政府僅管轄工務，敎育，衛生，稅收，監獄等事務，民選政府設委員十六名，其中華人六名，非華人十名，委員須具備選民資格，法庭陪審員資格，並須由兩名紳士推薦。選民資格規定須爲年齡滿二十五歲之英國籍民，並須有每月負祖房屋稅一百元之能力。上月底所廣播民選市政府組織草案，曾謂：仍須繼續商集意見，始作最後意見，港英商會爲英商人總集團，其意見可能影響港政。</p>

<h3>江陰要塞所需各砲　正由台灣設法運來</h3>

<h3>社論　龐德敎授的臨別贈言</h3>
<p>世界法學權威，我國司法行政部顧問龐德敎授，業於昨日返美，將於明年六月再行來華長期工作。龐氏來華三月，對我國憲草及一般法制，曾作初步綜合硏究，所見實在値得國人重視。龐氏是一個美國人，對於美國憲法及一般法制，親歷其境，自然知之最稔；但他是一個法學權威，能够從他的主觀中解放出來，作客觀的研究，三個月來就觀察硏究的結果，提供給我們很多寳貴的意見。對於五五憲草，他認爲是一部可以滿意的法典。常然，憲法是一種活的東西，貴在滋畏發育，不能斤斤於文字上的條款。他說：「任何法律制度，皆有歷史及社會背景，西洋法制之背景與中國不同，移殖於中國未必皆宜，應斟酌國情，予以取捨。」這幾句話，的是至理名言。本於這種觀點，他認爲五五憲草中所規定的制度，實在極會合國國情。國內一部份人士所主張的中國應採取內閣兩院制，龐氏期期以爲不可，這尤値得國人的深思。</p>
<p>關於憲草，自「政協」以來，幾經審議，而若干人仍主採取　閣兩院制度。這實在是一種幼稚的舉動，徒然表示他們的無知。兩院內閣制度，產生於英倫，演化結果，祇有一權，此我國父早已言之，而所謂兩院，實巳名存實亡。到了法國，兩院內閣制度的採行，使法國長在政治紛擾中，永沒有政治上的安定。這種制度的本身，本不健全，實無須移殖到中國來。况中國自有其國情，即使是別國的善良制度，也朱必能合於中國的國情。所以關於中國的政制，五五憲草所擬定的，實在是參酌國外成規我國國情的一種最理想的制度。我們不要輕視了自己，不加珍重。龐德敎授在臨行之際，又特別指出：「中國人才濟濟，中國人應有自信心，勿專事摹仿他國。」我們尤應三復斯言！</p>
<p>此外，又有若干人士主張中國應採行英美法系，廢止撿察制度，而代以英美之國家律師制度，及陪審制度。殊不知此種議論，亦有未合，龐氏就說：「中國採行大陸法制，歷三十餘年，不宜多所更張·」此非頑固保守之論，實因國家制度行之旣久，不宣輕舉　留亂　　　革。在跑騙的勢力上，我們應將中國的法系建立起來。</p>
<h3>兩種民主的鬥爭</h3>
<p>現在世界上流行的，在外國人看來，似乎已有了兩種民主主義。因爲它們的性質和制度根本不同，到處引起許多的誤會和糾紛，於是許多外交官和政客，却可以利用名詞意義的混淆，來作政治鬥爭的工具。</p>
<p>前幾天蘇聯外長莫洛托夫公開攻聲英國的民主是十九世組的民主，蘇聯的民主纔是二十世紀的民主。本報已經指出他這次演說是驚人的。我們很高興聽見，蘇聯最有力量的代表能够第一次把兩種「民主」淸楚的劃分出來！我們最近讀了許多英美報紙，大部份都攻擊蘇聯「不民主」，而蘇聯的報紙廣播，也攻擊英美爲「反民主」。我們弄不懂他們在爭論什麽？</p>
<p>英國的民主，遠因是由於文藝復興以後個人的意識提高，近因是由十七世紀以來哲學思想的轉變和十八世紀工業的革命。由於思想和工業的轉變革命，歐洲的人類急需要政治自由。政治自由，包括言論·出版·選舉·納稅幾件最重要的事項。這是現在英美和世界其他許多國家民主主義的精華。假如一個國家政府剝奪了人民這些自由·在英美人眼光看來，這個國家的政府就不能算民主。民主的反面就是專制。在壓迫人民自由的意義之下，君主專制，貴族專制，和無產階級專制，根本沒有分別。就算他們專制的動機是爲民，但是其爲專制則一，他們頂多不過是古代的「開明專制的君主」（Benevolent　Despotic）</p>
<p>蘇聯的民主，起源於十九世紀後半葉，歐洲社會經濟的不安，和馬克斯學說的宣傳。這種民主，實際上就是共產主義。它的性質根本不同，它要爭取的不是政治自由而是經濟自由，它想建設的制度，不是各黨各派代表全民自由的議院，而是無產階級一黨專政的蘇維埃。旣云專政，何言民主？這不過是英美人的看法。蘇聯共產然的看法，却認爲他們是最民主的，因爲他們眞正在經濟方面爲人　謀　　。</p>
<p>假如我們明白這兩個名詞相同而意義逈異的民主主義，許多國外國內的政治現象就淸楚得多。如像最近美國名記者約翰費歇爾在「克林姆宮內恐懼的人」一文中，述及蘇聯許多極端不民主的現象。蘇聯全國一切的大權，都在十四個領袖人物的手中，政治警察密切監視，人民不得同外國人談話交際，甚至於在一千二百個人民最高代表開會的時候，每六步就有一個政治警察持槍監視。這些代表們唯一的工作，就是聽完預定演說之後，一致表示贊成！；新聞方面，全部是政府的機關報。有一位政治當局對約翰費歇爾說。假如美國眞是民主，就應當把許多報紙根本肅淸。</p>
<p>把反對報紙根本肅淸，用恐怖政策強迫人民絕對服從，代表只有舉手，政治警察晝夜監視，稍一不愼就有生命的危險。這就是蘇聯式的民主，也就是延安所正在學習的民主，也就是全世界共產黨員個個所憧憬的民主。而且在蘇聯政府現在的立塲看來，除非全世界的國家都變成這樣的民主，（例如莫洛托夫外長所舉的保加利亞），蘇聯本身就不會感覺安全。</p>
<p>我們所最奇怪的，在另外一方面，蘇聯和世界各國的共產黨爲　政治鬥爭起見，又喜歡用英國式民生的意義，來攻擊對方的不民主。這抓鬥爭的技術，固然有時也可以號召刺戟一些不明眞相的人，然而也常常使共黨本身陷於不可逃避的矛盾。因爲共黨自己所行的是一套，攻擊別人的是另一套，故共黨所攻擊別人的過失往往就是他們自己本身比別人厲害十倍以上的過失！</p>
<p>但是平心而論，蘇聯不管怎樣專制，有一點還能到處博得大多數人類的同情嚮往，就是蘇聯對民生問題的全神注意。人類是愛好自由的，似是在衣食不足的時候，很可以迫　走向另外的極端，寧肯受專制的壓迫，不願眼睜睜看見別人享受而首己餓死。這種反常的現象，並不是蘇聯的一黨專政制度眞正爲人類所愛好，乃是在經濟艱困之下，他們不能不兩害相形擇其輕。假使學蘇聯的信徒們，恰巧學了蘇聯的專政，而遺忘了蘇聯的顧到民生，反而迫使人民無法生存，到處流亡，那更不知道離民主幾千萬里了。</p>
<p>假如說美國抵抗共產主義最好的方法，是政府努力於改善大衆的生活，使十五年內沒有經濟恐慌，那麼中國中央政府抵抗共產黨割據內亂最好的方法，　　要的也莫過於立刻加速的實行民生主義。老實說，國民政府縱非已經實行憲政，究較自延安以至蘇北的共黨「解放區」，民主得多，得須更注意於民生。民生主義不實行，人民生活沒有辦法，則專制主義，蘇聯式的民主就有乘隙而入的機會。</p>
<h3>中共的宣傳戰術</h3>
<p>中共發言人王炳南氏，前天向報界談稱：「馬帥自牯嶺返京，如不能帶回政府接受中共要求召開三人小組會議的答覆，則將不復有談判的理由。」弦外之音，國共商談似已到了最後出談判。此雖係中共宣傳戰神經戰之一貫作風，但國共商談將冽山窮水盡的地步，是否能再有柳暗花明的境界，確成疑問。不過馬朋入上牯嶺，返京而後，聞巾共有在某種條件之下可能參加五人小組會議之說，而馬帥又擬於太星期末，九上牯嶺，俾爲中國國內和平，作最後一次努力，則我們今天對和談大局，也還不必絕對悲觀。</p>
<p>我們且平心靜氣，觀察一下時局由僵持而進入睡眠狀態的癥結，究竟在那裏？中國經過八年艱苦的抗戰，痛定思痛，還有誰願見戰禍的再起？所以渴望和平，旣是全國人民普遍的心理，即在政府常局，更要在和平的空氣中，致力於復與建國的偉業。但在中共方面，表而上口口聲聲說要和平而實際則天天遺兵調將，攻城奪地，無論近來所得結果如何，是否於彼有利，而它原來想擴充地盤，不惜肢解中國的一念，固已昭然若揭。中共旣抱了這種壞的念頭，和政府進行談判，怎樣能够談判得有結果呢？今日局而的造成，不僅爲我們意料所及，就是美國與論界　如紐約泰晤士報所說，也說「中共對於談判所抱的隊謀，乃僅　稍獲喘息，以重振政治鬥爭而已。」但是中共始終不肯反躬　省，而對於好意協助我統一復興的友邦，反欲煽動人民起來反對，企岡嚇退他們。這個詭計雖未能奏效，但中共至今還沒有放棄逼個企圖。王炳南的談話，還在要求：（一）撤退美國駐在中國之全部軍隊，（二）停止援助國民政府，（三）凍結一切剩餘物資，合衆社昨日南京電所稱，首都盛傳美國正在考慮暫時凍結剩餘物資，這種說法，我們疑心又是共黨旁敲側擊的宣傳戰衛之一。總之，共黨的處心積慮，就是想用種稱方法，孤立國民政府，使國民政府外無友邦，內無友黨，然後可以一！共　　　所欲爲·</p>

<h3>美海長支援貝爾納斯　杜魯門接見華萊士　任何有關外交政策演辭　今後須先交國務院審核</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十八日廣播華盛頓訊：白宮今晨宣布：杜魯門總統將於今日下午八時接見商務部長華萊士，權威方面人士認爲杜魯門此舉，乃抵制國務院及陸海軍方面要求華萊十辭職所施壓力之證明云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十八日廣播：華萊士準備於今日下午三時半（上海時間十九日上午二時半）與杜魯門總統會晤。據合衆社特派員威爾遜預測，華萊士今後僅有兩途可循，一爲自今以後緘口不言，一爲退出內閣，因目下內閣之危機，已至攤牌之時間。不然，貝爾納斯勢必辭職。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十八日廣播華盛頓訊：此間某方人士認爲杜魯門總統本人不致堅持華萊十辭職，恐仍將請其留於原職。杜魯門在目前唯有二途可循：（一）要求華萊士去職，但此舉將使杜魯門在一九四八年選舉中趨於失敗，（二）無保留地接受華萊士之政策，並使國務院走向此一政治路綫，然此一辦法事實上爲不可能，因各方正施以壓力故也。據今晨華萊士向法國新聞社代表所言，杜魯門不致要求華氏辭職。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕據白宮宣布，華萊士定於星期三會見杜魯門總統，此爲華氏在紐約發表驚人演說後初次與杜魯門晤談，一般人對其發展咸頗重視。若干外交家以爲華氏演說旣引起如此重大反響，杜魯門或將私自勸吿華萊士不談外交政策，以免本黨內閧及顧全國際關係</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十八日廣播倫敦訊：據「標準晚報」外交評論家巴里曼宣稱：杜魯門總統或正召請貝爾納斯於本週末返華盛頓一行，俾有所商討。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十八日廣播：貝爾納斯今日與英和會代表亞歷山大會談達一小時。美代表團發言並謂：自華萊士演說事件發生以來，貝氏迄木與杜魯門通訊。衆悉貝氏對華氏演說，並禾發表任何批評。外交界人士正以關切之心靜待今日杜魯門接見華萊士之結果。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十八日廣播紐約訊：美海長福福萊斯特，今在千餘美工業家及海部高級職員前嚴厲指摘華萊士之演說，並對貝爾納斯備加稱贊，譽渠爲「爲國盡職之偉大美國人」。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十入日電〕海長福萊斯特原定在海軍協會之年會聚餐會中發表演說，演說稿事先已發交報界，今突取消原來計劃。福氏謂，「余意已有改變，決定尙以保守靜默爲佳」。事後海軍部發言人並謂，「此乃完全福氏本人之意，國務院或白宮並未施用壓力」。福氏之解釋復謂，「自華盛頓歸來時，余在萬呎高空。沉思過去數日由在此城發生之若干原子十風波，全覺若提及世界任何部份，決不能未有反嚮。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十七日電〕」美代理國務卿古萊頓頃接見各報記者，有人以「從何而得表明美國外交政策」爲問。代理國務卿當即答稱：「杜魯門總統所發表之聲明曁國務卿貝爾納斯在德國所發表之演設，均足以表明美國外交政策。余認爲嗣後各部部長發表演說，凡涉及外交政策者，在事前均須交由國務院核准，此項辦法並非伅各部長不能享受言論自由，亦非使其不得發表任何意見，但欲使政府對於此項演說能以表示贊成其意見至何程度而已」。</p>
<h3>華萊士致總統函發表　主張對蘇採綏靖政策　應訂立條約共同管制原子能</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕商務部長華萊士曾於上月廿三日致函杜魯門總統，計長十二頁，主張放棄聯合國原子能委會美代表巴魯克及副國務卿艾克遜之原子能管制計劃，完全改變美國軍事及外交政策，並同意蘇聯採取合理之防衛措施，以免引起第三次世界大戰。華氏此函已於今日公開發表。內中首次正式宣稱，杜魯門總統曾邀請斯達林來美，由此以觀，則華氏近在紐約所發表之美國外交政策演說，其內容殆早已吿知杜魯門總統。華氏於函中對國務院所採政策，曾作廣汎之批評，而對下列兩項，允特別提出指責，即（一）國務院主張蘇聯如欲向美國獲得借款，應以先與他國進行貿易談判爲先決條件。（二）國際共管多瑙河並反對在韃靻尼爾海峽等防禦工程。據稱，倘蘇聯提出建議，主張國際共管蘇彝士或巴拿馬運河，且不使設防，則吾人亦必感覺慌恐與忿怒，而蘇聯處境似恰與此相同。華氏之意，殆已認爲美國因擁有原子彈重量炸彈及無散佈各處之軍事基地，故其與人講斤頭之力量現較任何國爲大。據稱，蘇聯此刻所作努力，以與美國相較「小有進步」而已。</p>
<p>袪除蘇聯疑懼　安全能獲保障</p>
<p>華氏警吿稱，美國之決策者須知其現在所抱態度，只可發生兩種可能，即（一）與蘇聯不免一戰，（二）整個人類毀於此戰。由此觀之，則吾人固必須貫取和平之路，改善美蘇關係之基本要着，應爲减少引起蘇聯發生恐懼，疑慮，及不信任之種種暗礁。吾人應自新的立塲，認識何者爲蘇聯所認爲維持其本身安全及世界和平而必需之各項措施，並與之合作，共同建立世界秩序。吾人應準備對蘇聯合理的保障安全之措施，表示同意，甚至被人目爲「討好蘇聯」，亦所不惜。吾人不應對管制原子能之否決權問題，多事追究，因此一問題並無關係，且根本不應提出。吾人應準備進行訂立條約，使各國共同管制及發展原子能。本人相信此乃一重大問題，且就目前趨勢覜之，此一間題殆有陷於破裂而無成立協議之希望。</p>
<p>放棄強力政治　謀取經濟合作</p>
<p>美國不應在國際性之會議席上發表其一如已受外國侵略之言論，蓋戰時未受破壞，戰後在軍事方面反較戰前爲强者，僅有美國一國而已。美國應與蘇聯在經濟及商業上更密切合作，蘇聯向美國借款問題應自「經濟及商業之立塲」視之，而不應雜以强力政治。此外並應立即與蘇聯進行貿易談判，但以美蘇文化之不同，且蘇聯在任何協議中顯均堅持「交換」原則，故與之成立協議亦非易事，但亦非絕不可能，本人之建議，係欲改變吾人對於國際問題之一部份觀念，吾人必須立刻改變政策。</p>
<h3>函件公布經過曲折</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕杜魯門總統曾在最後一分鐘，　止商務部長華萊士八月廿三日致總統函之公布。據聞此函係因總統飭各閣員發表外交政策之意見而作者。據商務部稱，該函係自檔案中被「竊去」，入於某特寫作家之手。華萊士當即與白宮新聞秘書羅斯商議此事，決定此函旣已洩流於外，不如予以公布爲佳，羅斯吿華萊士表示同意，並印就分發各報，羅斯旋與總統談及，得悉總統不贊成發表此函，以免外國方面誤認總統贊同此函內容，但分發谷報已經開始，不及收回，由羅斯自認其咎，與華氏無關，至於報紙特寫作家究係何人，商務部並未舉出其名，但據特寫作家庇亞遜稱，「除非華萊士之聲明指出余自商務部竊取之函件，係致杜魯門總統之一俄文信，則余不得不控吿其誹謗之罪」。庇氏並稱，渠獲得此項文件，「另有來源，與商務部無關，且能度光明正大」云。</p>
<h3>美蘇異見應調整　美陸軍官員之表示</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十七日合衆電〕陸軍部官員今稱，美蘇間長期和平希望，雖或未能如願實現，但一般對美蘇即將衝突之恐懼，亦未能於世界局勢中獲得根據，陸軍部負責任之官員認爲最近五年內，即有戰爭之猜測，實未能有其證據。參謀總部則以爲遍佈全世界之戰爭恐懼大部分由於因美蘇間締造和平時發生之外交摩擦中，引起一種不合理之憂慮所放。該官員强調稱，蘇聯於二次大戰中，創鉅痛深，而歷史事實證明儿於兩次戰爭之間，必有一建設及養息之期。渠並指稱，美蘇應於付諸裁制以前逕而調整彼此之異見。</p>
<h3>希遊擊戰事蔓延　政府決在全國進行掃蕩　共黨領袖以煽動罪被捕待審</h3>

<p>〔聯合社雅典十七日電〕希臘軍隊與憲兵對游擊隊之戰事遍及全國，今日益見緊張。主要戰塲最近已自馬其頓省轉移，兩月前，該省省長曾謂，一游擊戰」在塞薩萊平原進行，雅典至薩隆尼加之交通幹錢通過該處。暴徒在公路埋置地雷，破壞交通，切斷電話綫，並襲擊軍隊與警察。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典十七日電〕希臘共黨領袖柴却里亞第斯，明日將在薩隆尼加，以煽動人民罪，並互相憎恨之罪開庭審詢。雅一典共產黨部昨遭搜査，有六人被一捕，該黨頃爲此事提出抗議。又一特里波里斯及伯羅奔尼撤兩地之一共黨領袖七人，亦被放逐。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南斯拉夫十七日電〕阿爾巴尼亞京城息：本月十三日，有希臘士兵五名喬扮婦女，深入阿爾巴尼亞境內，旋即退出，似仍繼續開槍。此舉證明希臘法西斯份子在阿國邊境擾事，無所不用其極。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕小兒麻痺症基金保管委員會今日宣布：擬大量輸入菲律賓與荷印所產之特種猴子，以供試騐之用。此種猴子爲解決脊髓麻痺症神秘性之唯一研究工具。第一步計劃，將以六個月時間，在菲島與荷印叢林中，獵取猴子，試騐之猴子年需五千頭，目前美國僅可得二百頭。戰時硏究結果，證明人頭之疾病與此種猴子最爲接近。</p>
<h3>聯合國派遣胡世澤　赴巴黎列席和會　美代表仍維持堅決立場</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十八日廣播：聯合國副秘書長胡世澤今日下午三時三十五分抵達奧爾利。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十七日合衆電〕聯合國副秘書長胡世澤，本日飛往巴黎，代表賴依列席和會旁聽。渠稱，聯合國有方法壓制任何國家之侵略行爲，渠以聯合國與摩托車相喩謂吾人如不知如何駕駛，則不幸事件自當發生。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十七日電〕就各種徵象觀，出席和會之美代表團，當一本旣定方針，遇有與蘇聯代表團意見衝突時，當維持堅決之立塲。各代表包括貝爾納斯並不因華萊士之主張對蘇採取較緩和之政策的變其初衷。</p>

<h3>對我國民政府　美應加強援助　美國生活雜誌之主張</h3>
<p>九月二號美國出版之「生活雜誌」，發表社論，題曰「中國國難」推論中國之現狀，其論點則以中國將爲第三次世界大戰之導錢，戰塲與決戰塲所，其言甚爲警闢。作者亨利范杜生，今夏在中國，曾與中美人士交換意見，深知中國現狀，生活雜誌，以此文爲其社論，可作該刋言論之代表；茲摘要介紹其論點。</p>
<p>范氏之言曰：「中國今日，遭遇自民國革命以來所未有之嚴重國難，分析言之，約有三端：一，經濟失調，二，內戰，三，政治腐化；以上三者，互爲因果，經濟失調，足以引起政治腐化，與共黨活動；政治腐化，足以引起經濟失調，與共黨活動；亦正因共黨活動，而益使全國經濟失調，政府威望漸减；政府威望漸减，又使經濟失調，與共黨活動，更覺無法收拾。</p>
<p>「國民黨與共產黨之問，有難於調和之處；國民黨以現政府爲正統；而共產黨則以統治全中國爲其最終目的；日本投降以後，蘇聯以東北與日軍所有之武器，留與中國共產黨，遂使中國問題，益爲複雜與嚴重。</p>
<p>「馬歇爾特使奔走調處於國共之回，已將半年，而終少成就。今日之美國外交政策，將如何確定？以下根據現狀，試作分析</p>
<p>（一）美國外交政策，當以未來三次世界大戰爲着眼點，預作布置；</p>
<p>（二）未來之三次世界大戰，將爲蘇聯及其衛星國，與美英及西歐各國之衝突；</p>
<p>（三）未來三次世界大戰，可能不在歐洲或近東爆發，而在東亞爆發；屆時美蘇兩國，必在此間發生衝突；三次大戰，即使不在東亞爆發，美蘇兩國，亦必在東亞發生職事；東亞且爲三次大戰決定勝負之塲所；</p>
<p>（四）中國未來大局之發展，因此當爲美國所注意，吾人如不憚現實，華北實爲美蘇之前綫；</p>
<p>（五）因此美國今日必須予中國政府以切實之援助。「所幸者，今日之莫斯科，尙以歐洲爲其主要對象，在最近之將來，未必即在東亞冒險與中國或美國，發生衝突。</p>
<p>「然則美國可否撤去其對中國之援助，曰，不可；美國如撤去其援助，則中國國民政府，必被迫傾向於蘇聯，此爲美國外交上之極大威脅。</p>
<p>「今日之中國，國外援助，與國內改革，當同時並重，二者缺一不可，無國外援助，國內不能改革；國內如不改革，國外援助，亦屬無用；因此美國之政策，一方當予中國以援助，一方當使中國各領袖，負責整理太國內務。」</p>
<p>范氏係宗敎領袖，彼之言論，與政府並無關係；亦不能代表美國全部與論，惟其觀察。分析中國在世界大局中之地位一點，則殊堪注意。如不幸而竟言中，不幸而三次世界大戰，必須發生；更不幸而三次世界大量，竟發生於中國，再不幸，而中國竟爲三次世界大戰之主要戰塲；又不幸而中國今日之內戰，或竟爲三次世界大戰之序幕；吾人試思中國未來之慘狀，將爲何如！同屬華夏胃裔，如能顧念中國之前途，捐除成見，共圖改新，今日時機，尙可懸崖勒馬；如其不然，則四萬萬人之受難，將千百倍於過去之西班牙，望國人，其速醒！（胡煥庸譯）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會昨日上午第十三次會議，由敵僞產業處理局報吿工作，各參議員質詢甚激烈。下午爲分組討論提案，內中除第一·第二·第四·三組業經審査完畢，其餘七組亦經分別審査，全部結束。昨討論最熱烈者當爲第三組與第九組，前者審査市長交議之增加捐稅及跑馬問題，後者則詳細審核市府半年新預算·</p>
<p>今日議事日程上午舉行第十五次會議，繼續討論民政第十五號關於檢舉漢奸案，並討論金融提案。下午第十六次會議討論工商經濟提案。</p>
<p>昨日上午參議會由蘇浙皖區敵僞產業處理局派該局秘書長沈冠亞出席報吿。沈氏稱：到參議會報吿是一件苦事，因爲要受質詢，而質詢就是挨駡。本人並不怕挨罵，今天奉命前來出席報吿。最後沈氏並稱：處理敵偽產業雖不敢說後無來者，但確係前無古人·因爲淸朝以來我們一直打敗仗，只有人家拿我們的財產。勝利之初，處理局匆匆成立，因陋就簡，到今天不敢說有成績，應該辦的已經辦了，有些地方自己也不滿意。</p>
<p>關於十月來，處理局之工作，沈氏分類報吿。據稱：審議會每週開會三次，迄今會議一百三十餘次，釐訂章則辦法近一百種，通過議案的一千五百餘起。</p>
<p>關於接收產業物資及其處理：碼頭倉庫，經由江海關接點一千一百五十六所。工廠經濟部接收滬市工廠，計四八〇廠。關於各廠復工問題，社會人士極爲注意，但復工需有機械設備及錢，而經濟部經濟困難，對於各廠復工，實已盡最大努力。房地產傢俱，均依照規定，委託中央信託局接收。所有敵僞房地產，奉令一律出售。德僑產業，包括德孚洋行，拜耳藥廠，西門子等。査緝工作，亦係最挨罵之工作。共受理案件約二千五百件，査獲物資達三百餘億。査緝組巳於六月底結束，已發吿密獎金三億餘元·</p>
<p>關於變賣售現，依照院令規定，敵僞產業物資，除一部份轉讓有關機關外，其餘槪須標賣售現。變賣方法有三：一平售與配售，二託售及價讓，三標賣及拍賣。以上各項處理敵僞產業收款，截至八月三十一日止，共計國幣三三一，八五一，二八二，五六〇，九一元，希望年底能達五千億。此筆款項，對於平衡上海區發行額，不無幫助云。</p>
<p>一片責難聲　兩耳聽不盡</p>
<p>沈冠亞報吿完畢後，開始口頭質問。首先登台者爲諸文綺氏，所詢係關於敵僞時期被强迫收買之紗布，如何處理問題。被徵買之各紗布商曾請求處理局發還，一度獲允准，且已有六家獲得該項紗布，突又中止發還。請問處理局究取何種態度？到底發還不發還？</p>
<p>處理局一方面將若干工廠撥配後方廠商，另一方面又答應各該工廠原主有優先承購之權，一女許兩姓，如何可以？</p>
<p>美商直接接收之廠家，處理局即不再聞問，國人工廠必須經種種處理工作，中外待遇不同，何故？處理局一切工作太慢，可以三字形容之，曰「牛步化」。（二）黃炳權詢敵人收買之紗布達四十餘萬件，一千六百萬疋，究竟如何解決，解決到何種程度？（三）陳保泰詢稱：不知這位先生尊姓大名，請自我介紹一番。處理局係戰後臨時機構，亦係戰後剝削人民之機構，參議會係人民產生的，必須爲人民講話，我們要求中央撤銷處理局，由市政府辦理。</p>
<p>（四）金潤庠詢：關於强佔民房案子。多數發還原主之房屋，僅爲文字上之發還，而事實上並未拿到。蓋「官官相護」，不肯切實保護老百姓。並舉例稱：寗紹商輸公司堆棧，被八個武裝機關佔據，尙有爲敎育部及警察局佔據之房屋。請問處理局發還被佔房屋，是否有此種情形？處理局有權令强佔者遷出否？（五）費樹聲詢：處理局係勞民傷財機構，上海人民所受痛苦極深。處理局旣係臨時機構，理應淸淸楚楚接收，淸淸楚楚處理，快快結束。請問何時可以結束？處理局人員偵査密吿敵僞財產，是否有凟職行爲？憑一紙密告，即將物資扣押。請求發還，竟索視原始發票？請問劉局長家中東西，是否皆有原始發票？（六）賈德超詢：處理局査封物資極夥，但其中一部份並非敵僞產業，提供充足證據，請求發還，仍遲遲不理，最後發還，內中已空空如也，何故？拍賣物資，要走路道，可以極低廉價格拍到手，所謂走路道，包括請客，送嵦，鈔票及黃金。確否？目前郊區未被査封之敵僞）產業甚多，何故？（七）陸惠民詢：處理人員何故任意車裝査封之敵僞物資？（八）吳正矱報吿一件事實，有某重要工廠，創於民十三四年，曾有過重要發明，敵方壓迫該廠某大股東出讓，但該股東深明大義，不爲所誘。最後敵方施以威迫，　乃佯　一紙收據，所取之款，不足全廠價値百分之四。勝利後該廠股東曾分向各有關機關申請、處理局派員調査結果，竟被判由該廠股東優先承購，現値數十億元，如何買得起？祇能望廠興嘆而已。請問處理局對被壓迫情形是否經過詳細審核？該廠股東原擬向上級申述，處理局方面答稱：「很好，我們要沒收了。」何故？（九）顧錦藻稱：本人並非質詢，乃係提供一點事實，應特別注童。目前變相逃避物資，數目大得駭人。國防部現留用若十日本人，用種種變相方式隱藏大部物資。利用台灣人，政府官吏及中將以上將領合組公司，將逃避物資作資本，希望處理局注意。（十）朱文德詢：人民繳處理局之原始證件一再遺失，何故？問處理局人員「遺失了怎樣辦」，答稱「另想辦法」。至於甚麼辦法，則盡在不言之中。（十一）侯寄遠稱：本人並非有所「質」，僅僅是問。虹口方面孔祥熙產業被當敵產拍賣，目前孔氏要求收還，買主不肯，致起糾紛。已達拍賣階段，處理局尙未將產權弄淸楚，是何道理？</p>
<p>請求撥款九億　舉辦救濟事業</p>
<p>第七組審査會舉行第四項會議，對於社會救濟及勞工之全部提案均經初步議決。關於社會局救濟及婦女救濟議決合併辦理。緣今春蔣主席蒞滬時，社局曾請求主席撥款九億元以作救濟事業之用，蒙主席面允准向行政院接洽，後政院令轉向「行總」請撥，「行總」則囑向上海分署領款，但上海分署無此經費，致救濟費至今未獲。近經婦女界呈請市參議會擬請市府撥款舉辦救濟婦女事業，總數亦爲九億元，要求列入市府澦算項內，經昨日審査結果，議決請求經費九億元合辦救濟事業，交大會討論。</p>
<p>戲院請願</p>
<p>該組並接獲戲劇院同業公會　願六點：（一）請減娛樂稅率，（二）請禁軍人無票觀劇滋事，（三）調整勞資關係，（四）請簡化繳稅手續，（五）請延長營業時間，（六）希望當局可能設法貸款救濟·又永安公司天　樓爲公司當局需收回院址向該會請願，均將由審査會審核後轉交大會討論。</p>
<p>關於工務公用</p>
<p>第五組審査工務公用提案，昨日下午已將歸併後集成之二十案全部審査完畢。對於市輪渡案，由鍾參議員玉良說明昔日來往浦東浦西之二小火輪，乃由地方所辦，國民政府成立後由政府接收。浦東市民對於輪渡所費川資甚鉅，而目前浦東設施簡陋，政府應多予注意建設。後經審査議決，擬請市府以後將市輪渡收入抽取百分之一專歸舉辦浦東地方事業之用。</p>
<p>又該組討論取締三輪車人力車案亦甚激烈，經議決請公局多設公共汽車，則可使三輪車，人力車自然淘汰，否則廢除交通工具將更形困難。</p>
<p>衹能意會不可言傳　沈冠亞答覆質詢</p>
<p>質詢吿一段落，休息十分鐘後，由沈冠亞扼要答覆。（一）紗布案子將來行政院一定有所裁定。至於所發還之紗布，就記憶所及，似爲五家。因爲最初處理局第三組及法律顧問委員會認爲應發還，而審議委員會決定推翻前議，故取消。至於該美商廠家，因未舉出廠名，無從答覆。倘能舉出廠名，常由書面答覆。關於辦理手續遲緩，因上海淪陷八年，一件件案子都得詳査，不查又要挨駡，不免慢些。（二）答覆見前。（三）說處理局是剝削人民機構似不妥。好在淸査團在此，檢舉也無所謂。處理局由市政府接辦很好，權限可統一，但須由行政院決定。（四）關於強佔，在今日情形下，沒有辦法，也不便多說。多說即有攻擊某方面之嫌。處理局所接收之房屋，有百分八九十被佔據。處理局僅能處理，無强制軍事機關能力。此點大家只可意會，不便言傳·請諸位參議員想個辦法，處理局一定照辦。</p>
<p>此時陸蔭初參議員起立稱：旣係只可意會，不可言傳，處理局乾脆用不着答覆了·沈冠亞徵詢主席意見，潘　長稱，可改書面答覆·</p>
<p>限期檢舉漢奸　引起激烈爭辯　大會昨繼續討論提案</p>
<p>答覆詢問吿一段落後，繼續討論民字第十一號至第十五號各提案，以討論第十五號提案「擬請中央限期澈底檢舉淸除漢奸，依法徵一處，並對已被檢舉或已在押之漢奸，速爲公開迅辦審判，以張國法，而平民憤案，」情緒最爲緊張，發言最爲踴躍·潘議長並回至議員席，請徐副議長任主席，對本案有所說明。潘議長稱：「此案意義重大，本席事前曾徵詢過律師，司法行政部長，法院檢察官等方面之意見，我們知道，上海政治性漢奸，可以一目瞭然，但上海之工商界人士，要做生意，又豈能與日本人不發生關係？農民種榖種棉花，日本人要，又豈能不賣給他們？我們上海市參議會係代表上海市民者，不能因這個問題而騷擾市民·所以，對於檢舉政治性漢奸，不能規定期限。對於檢舉非政治性漢奸，應有期限·我們必須特別注意者，檢舉漢奸規定期限，並非放鬆，只有督促加緊檢舉漢奸工作，聽大家趕快檢舉，過了期限就不能檢舉了。總之，本案應該愼重討論。</p>
<p>潘議長發言之前，吳正矱，王先靑，姜懷素，瞿鉞各參議員皆有所說明。主旨皆爲檢舉漢奸，倘無期限，不肖之徒，往往以之要挾，使人民日夜不安。瞿鉞並認爲懲治漢奸條例，有修正之必要。</p>
<p>馮有眞贊同潘議長之意見，並强調聲明，所以需要規定檢舉漢奸期限，一可加緊懲治漢奸，二可防止要挾，以免影響人民生活。馮氏對審査意見中之辦法第一項，「擬請中央明定法令限期檢舉漢奸，欠妥，蓋明定法令或難辦到，建議改爲「擬請中央明令規定檢舉漢奸期限」。</p>
<p>賈德超突起立表示反對，稱應使漢奸終生不能抬頭，故檢舉不應規定期限。亦有人認爲檢舉漢奸倘訂期限，若干逍遙國外漢奸，期滿即可大搖大擺返國。但據答稱：不論漢奸現在何地，皆可檢舉，由政府通緝，決不能逃出法綱。</p>
<p>因已到散會時間，本案關係重大，故由多數參議員通過，移至今日上午繼續討論</p>
<p>關於此案，據詹文滸吿記者稱：似應於通過本案同時提議並通過另一提案，即由本届參議會正式代表市民對上海各界漢奸作一次總檢舉，倘能如此，則贊成限期者可以行動表示檢奸決心，而反對限期者亦可以大刀闊斧手段，把全市各種大小漢奸一網打盡，以快人心。且各種材料亦極現成似可請敵僞產業處理局協助因每一產業均有一產權人，產業局於處理敵僞產業時，必先査明其產權人爲誰，此項產權人非敵即僞，以之爲檢舉基礎最爲得當·</p>
<p>市府各機關首長應隨時體察民隱</p>
<p>民字第十一號提案係提議「市長及市府，所屬各機關首長，應隨時至各郊區巡視，俾體察民隱而督促地方行政案，」決議通過。</p>
<p>民字第十二號提案，係「請市府通飭居民，凡年在十四歲以下之孩童，必須佩帶簡明身份牌，以防萬一，」蓋慮孩童　途。多數參議員認爲殊不必要，「還是少一事吧！」故決議撤銷。</p>
<p>民字第十三號「爲提議咨請市政府發表編造生活指數標準，並如何計算編造案」大會決議將此案改爲書面詢問，請市府書面　覆·</p>
<p>房屋租賃管理　修正規則草案</p>
<p>第十小組單行規章的審核昨日整個下午審核「修正上海市房屋租賃管理規則草案」。審査委晨大都均係法律界人士，將草案引經據典逐條删改修正。</p>
<p>草案規定凡屬房屋糾紛先由區公所「調解」，「調解」不成由房屋租賃管理委員會「調處」，「誠處」不成則予以「裁斷」，當事人不遵守「裁斷」時，最後由治安機關「執行」·</p>
<p>出租人除收取租金保證金外，不得以任何名義收取頂費及小租，保證金之收取不得超過兩個月租金總額，租金應以國幣計算。標準另行訂定。</p>
<p>出租人不得隨意終止租賃，如無正當理由拒絕收受租金時承租人得呈准委員會將每月租金提存上海市銀行。</p>
<p>警務審查完畢</p>
<p>第二審査委員會關於警務方面之施政報吿及提案等已於上一次小組會議中全部審査完畢，審査意見亦已送交大會秘書處。昨日下午本擬再將此項審査結果複閱修正一遍以求愼重週密，但因原稿已由秘書處交付印刷，致未能實現。該組審査委員在會塲閒談片刻後即行離去·</p>
<p>市區不得賽馬　參議會審查初步決議</p>
<p>「賽馬」的議案，在第三審査委員會中一再討論而無結果。昨天下午第三組召集人路式導特地把這案子移到最後討論，使大家有充分的時間，但路參議員附帶地加了一句：「希望今天我們無論如何把這件案子的審査意見作一個決議。」結果又是熱烈了一番，反對者依舊堅持「不應該造成賭博之風」，但又有人覺得不必對道事看到如此嚴重。最後還是由趙參議員棣華根據市長交議案三點作三個審査結論，也作爲有關跑馬廳八個提案的合併審査意見，經審査會通過後再交大會討論：（一）市中心區（西藏路舊跑馬廳原址）不得賽馬。（二）慈善事業補助費應由市府另籌。（三）跑馬廳場地基金應由市府收用，但跑馬廳場地內容複雜，應由市府詳加調査，擬具辦法後再交大會議決。這樣總算把這件解決不了的問題，暫時先吿一段落。</p>
<p>財政　地政</p>
<p>第三組昨日審査財政地政案件共十一件，連同前數次會議，該組審査提案已吿完畢。關於審査報吿分成財政，地政和行政院分配上海各機關房屋委員會三組，每組由三議員負責審査，另有市商會化學原料同業公會等請願書十件，亦由三人分組審査後於今日中午再會同討論。</p>
<p>關於議長交議案二件：（一）爲准臨參會移送中國國民黨第一區七分部電請免增房租案，（二）爲准臨參會移送三十五年度本市田賦繳實案。與該組審査之提案中有相同者合併辦理。</p>
<p>行政費擬予酌減　事業費不予變動</p>
<p>第九組審査預算委員會，昨在福煦路福明邨市參議會舉行。經該組審査討論結果，認爲在裁負簡政之原則下，行政預算擬按原預算酌减百分之二十。但事業費則不予變動。又該組議員對於市參議會撥發議員交通費每人一萬元，不再領受，以减少市府支出。同時對於警察局騎巡隊認爲不必要，應予廢止。聞審査會對下半年度市府預算收入擬予增加三十至四十億，以擴展事業之用。</p>
<p>關於預算審查將由該組召集人徐永祚，李文杰，何元明等再行複査，如有必要時，仍再將舉行小組會議討論。</p>
<p>龐京周的衛生論　敲敲鑼就可做到</p>
<p>第八組審査衛生提案委員會召集人龐京周，昨日下午在審査會席上，把個人對於改進公共衛生的意見貢獻給衛生局局長張維。龐參議員認爲在現在這個急待解決衛生的時候，如果要使每個無知識的人來聽人灌輸衛生常識，是旣不可能又沒用的，因爲衛生並不是由什麽一個機關可以來做的工作，而是一種遝動，需要每個人來參加，推進實施。所以他希望衛生局能發動幾種衛生運動，其範圍旣大而方法簡單。</p>
<p>譬如說：第一，「洗手」運動，我們平時所接觸的人都知道洗手，對於這個運動聽來一定覺得好笑，實際上，如呆我們能督促着小孩子們在每次吃飯前洗洗手，工人做究工後，農人們種完田後洗一下手，那末他們生病的機會就可以減少許多，傳染病的百分率又可降低不少。「一個國家肥皂的消耗量可以代表一國文明的水準」范參議員守淵也同意地說。</p>
<p>第二，「洗澡」運動，和洗手運動是一種的意思。在好多鄉下偏僻地方的人，他們對於洗澡這件事，簡直莫明其妙。這也是一件非推動不可的事。第三，嬰兒死亡率增高，我們不能拿外國孩子吃牛奶，奶粉，魚肝油來比·其實母乳足够的孩子，也不會比專吃魚肝油的孩子體弱，母乳足；可以使嬰兒長　　又高又大·錦圖，瀆田施肥料，不應該用新的肥料，因爲新的肥料中若帶有傳染菌，澆在菜上，危險性極大，如果能多備一傢具，把糞便保存二星期，這樣細菌就會死掉。傳染病無形中又可以減少許多了，老年的農人們都知道用陳宿的肥料可以使菜肥一點，但不知其中還有減少傳染病的好處。第五，農田旁都應該養魚，許多農人都把池塘裏的小魚拿來吃掉，這是不應該的，他們都知道靑蛙有益稻田，却不知小魚也有同樣的長處，有幾種小魚，它們最愛吃蚊子，把瘧蚊吃掉後，瘧疾又可減少了。南美洲有一種叫「加巴齊亞」的小魚，繁殖非常的快，而吃蚊的本事極大，如果我們能要一點魚種來散在池塘喪，其功用莫大。</p>
<p>最後，　參議負說：「這幾件事叫一個保用拿起　　敲嬝下就能做翅了，爲　　不　完」！</p>
<p>討論敎育文化提案　一致建議增加經費　私立學校收費應加監督</p>
<p>第六審査委員會關於敎育文化之提案討論相當熱烈，但因昨日已爲最後一次小組審査，時間甚爲侷促，致量後幾個提案僅能作原則上的決定，另由召集人詳擬審査意見提交大會。</p>
<p>關於請市府增加敎育經費一案有人主張應提高爲市府總經費之百分之二十五，有人主張百分之三十。表決結果以九對六票通過百分之二十五的建議。</p>
<p>私立學校收費有過高的現象，提案之一爲請市府减低私校收費並嚴加監督。討論時有人主張將「减低」兩字改爲「規定」，有人主張改爲「審核」，最後將原案修正爲「請市府對於私立學校收費嚴加監督」。</p>
<p>形同變相學費的「尊師金」審査委員差不多一致主張取消，大家紛紛發言，痛述敎師尊嚴受到傷害學生家長對於校方印象惡劣以及國民學校絕對不應收費，至於敎師待遇不够應該另行設法增加。最後通過提案請市府規定下學期起公立中等學校不得收取「尊師金」，國民學校不得收取學費及任何其他名目之費用，對於敎師底薪應依照公敎人員待遇調整提高。</p>
<p>其餘審査通過的提案有：（一）區保機構應與敎育當局取得聯繫，負責協助推進國民敎育。（二）提倡電臺敎育，灌輸民衆智識。（三）女子學校應增設產科常識及婦嬰常識科。（四）切實改善各級市立學校，根據校長任免法令嚴禁校長兼職掛名。（五）特別注重科學敎育。（六）提倡家庭敎育。（七）請國家銀行舉辦文化事業貸款。（八）增設公立圖書館等。</p>
<h3>西報讚參議會　嫓美美各州議院</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據英文大美晚報稱：上海市參戰會的檢討與質詢是發洩民痛的一種「保安」機構。記者今日特前往觀察參議會工作之進展，一般的市參議員如何執行其策劃市政方針的職務。依市參議會中討論及發言之水準及一般參議員的儀態，實與美國各州議院大同小異。茍一美國州議員來滬出席市參議會，必感安然自適。今晨參議員對敵僞　　處理局提出最激烈之攻擊，此點亦使記者相信；若中國人民欲學習及實踐民主政治，市參議會實是一極理想之操總機會。市參議會在一週間工作之表現，遠在一般人預料之上。在過去一星期中，基至在今晨之　　中，各參議員均能在自由之環境下暢言其所欲言，縱使有指摘政府之處，亦在所不咸。今晨吳市長亦出席，休息時間中吿記者云：市府雖不免時受參議員之　　，然渠深慶有比自由討論之空氣，渠　爲上海市民倘能一面學　，一面實踐，民主政治，則眞正的民主必能在上海實現。</p>
<h3>接收請查團例會　五議員出席參加</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕參加淸査團之市參議會代表趙君豪·朱學範·馬君碩·王劍鍔·何元明五參議員，昨日上午十時出席該團例會，五參議員於會中表示：代表等本地方民意機關之立塲，工作方面希望着重於地方機構之案件。又代表中之馬君碩。王劍鍔兩議員爲本市名律師，故由該團公推有關法律方面之案件多加注意。會後記者訪張團長，叩詢該國辦理密吿案件之經過，據稱：本團辦理淸查工作之目標，在「對事不對人」，雖亦有因「事」涉「人」，但主要對象，仍爲判斷「事」的是非，關於本團五十餘天來之工作情形，不久即將招待各界，作公開報吿。記者又詢以對本市接收工作觀感如何？團長答：「不滿意」，並認爲行政院應多負責任。</p>
<p>記者旋向最近到團辦公之何參議員元明叩詢對淸査工作之意見。渠稱：淸査團係民意機構，對於營私舞弊貪贓枉法之接收大員，必須一一加以淸査。「査而不淸，」我們也要負責任。至於政府辦不辦，那不是我們的事情。</p>
<p>又凡市民如對淸査工作有所建議或對接收及處理舞弊情事有所檢舉，均可投函參議會轉達該團。</p>
<h3>空運販毒巨案　主犯落綱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警察局曾於上星期中破獲一規模宏大組織嚴密之空運販毒機關，因案犯一部份散居於平津等地，爲求全案人犯一　打盡計，除急電各該地警局予以協助緝捕外，連日經警察總局刑事處第二課及虹口分局各員警偵査之結果，主犯張義仁，已於日前在　落綱·　警局最早接獲報吿，在本月十一日先在崑山花園四號十二號房間，拘獲台灣人李紅英，係負責運輸毒品者，旋復在寳山路頤順里五十四號拘獲台灣人李定國，張根田及其妻張馮培英三名，抄出十六兩重嗎啡二包，約値二千四百萬元，復供出該機關駐滬負資人孫志成，住武昌路積善里九號。當由警局第二課馮股長率領負警馳往日夜守候，至十四日始捕獲，並在該處發現有秘密贓毒機關。據其在警局供稱，係受張義仁委託，担任上海推銷，所有毒品由李紅英由津乘飛機運來，每次運毒，係用一特製之夾底皮箱，計前後已達六七次，每次可獲利數百萬至千萬元不等。張義仁本人則行踪不定或在北平或往天津云。經警局去電平津兩地，請求調査後，旋接獲覆電，謂悉此人已來滬，警局遂出動全體幹員，着手佈置警綱，直至前日深晚，始在皇家飯店三百十一號將其本人及其弟張義生，妻張李秉崑，妾張謝奎弟拘獲，抄出夾底皮箱二隻帶局後，復派員至其滬寓所廣東路慶興里三十四號守候，繼續拘獲同黨江桂芳，謝禧年，何倪福保，何小妹四名，此外獲另一綫索，在南京飯店復捕獲嫌疑犯黃淸泉，陳永發，邱石堓，王金仁，賴淸瀛等五名，連同以前陸續所獲之朱岐山，鄒　葉，嚴東甫，張明遠，程午嵐，朱兆祥，宋自新，沈定山等，已達廿六名。現因案情尙須偵査，故虹口分局已將逮捕人犯定今日全部移解總局，併案偵訊云。</p>

<h3>市敎育局擬定　改進中等敎育計劃　提請市參議會公決</h3>
<p>上海市敎育局，擬定改進中等敎育，建設中等敎育區五年計劃，提請市參議會公決，其提案如决：本市敎育，自暴敵侵凌，備受摧毀，勝利以後，積極恢復，以學校之數量言、尙不爲尠，論其素質，除少數自建校舍，較爲完整，敎學設備，粗具規模外，類皆租賃民房，因陋就簡，亟待改進，茲就中等敎育而言，市立學校十九所，私立學校二百零七所，就學其中者，近十萬人，皆爲十二歲至十八歲之靑年，血氣一未定，知識空虛，可塑性極大，一若不於此時與以優良之敎育，陶一治其性靈，培養其品德，充實其知識，健全其體魄，則不特貽誤終身，益且危及國家民族。而大半學校，校舍狹隘，光綫不足，空氣污濁，聲音嘈雜，物質條件，缺憾實多。敎師以敎學爲塞責，學生視學校如傳舍，管敎疏懈，虛應故事，精神缺陷，至可憂懼。市區人烟稠密，他價高昂，籌建校舍，充實設備，尤屬匪易。何况社會習尙，萎靡貪鄙，耳濡目染，入人最深，學校之所薰育，不敵社會之同化，求其不爲物誘，卓爾自立，戞戞乎難矣。是以不欲培育靑年則已，欲培育能負建國重任之靑年，則非改進當前上海市中等敎育不可。欲改進當前上海市中等敎育，則非另爲靑年建設優良之敎育環境不爲功。本局有見及此，爰有就本市四郊幽靜之處，建設四大中等敎育區之擬議。茲特訂定計劃，積極推行，（甲）建設中等敎育區之原則，（乙）建設中等敎育區之辦法，（丙）建設中等敎育區之步驟，（丁）建設中等敎育區之要點。以上各項，逐一說明實施意見，至爲綦詳云·</p>

<h3>棉紗照原價配出　二批仍爲三萬件　紡建配貸紗號昨又向隅　魁星天女大跳東北暢銷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗廠聯合配銷委員會於昨日下午三時，召開例會。結果開售二十支棉紗，標準數額計民營五九八件，照申請額全配。紡建配出一三七三·五件，惟申請數額達六千二百餘件。售價以四百磅二十支雙馬爲標準，每件仍爲一百三十萬元。</p>
<p>又聯合配銷機構成立以來，第一批配紗集團，共三萬件。迄至昨日止，已售配二六，四五三·五件。現剩餘數額，民營各廠尙有一，二九八件，紡建建尙有二，二四八·五件。第一批集團配紗完畢後，即將籌劃第二批集團配紗，總額可能仍爲三萬件。民營各廠約佔三分之二，紡建約佔三分之一。現聞雙方在原則上已表同意，一俠具體決定，即可付諸實施。</p>
<p>杜絕皮球買賣紡建重訂條件</p>
<p>據中國紡建公司副總經理吳味經氏語本報記者稱：紡建昨日配紗，以生產廠家爲主，紗號並未配售。紡建因鑒於過去配紗，平均每家一件之制度，殊有未妥。結果大型之生產廠家，仍需向外搜買。流弊所及，紡建之准購單。銅牌。棧單及現紗等，竟均成市面流通買賣之籌碼。甚至廠家紗號在紡建之登記卡，亦被轉輾讓受。茲爲杜絕此項流弊計，紡建對各申請配紗之廠商，決嚴加甄審。大致根據：（一）各廠之生產設備。（二）各廠成立之年月。（三）報繳　業稅之多寡。今後將根據此項條件，而甄別各廠得紗之優先次序及數額。</p>
<p>紡建紗價略高具有三種原因</p>
<p>最近紗市趨勢，紡建所產各紗市價，似較雙馬略高。據吳氏解釋原因：（一）雙馬紗以南帮銷路居多，近因禁絕紗布南運，遂使滬地雙馬紗價趨跌。（二）本市各自動機織布廠，大多習用紡建所出之紗，（三）紡建已開之紗，十日後必可出貨。民營各廠出貨時間，則並不一律。</p>
<p>津幫大量搜購市價一哄而上</p>
<p>昨日紗市，奇峯突出，津帮大量拖吸，因東九省去化轉暢，對魁星及天女兩牌，獨加垂靑，開盤即一哄而上，兩牌俱做到一百四十三五萬，然同樣重量之配銷貨，輕磅金鷄大發雙馬飛虎等價，僅一百卅六七萬，尙乏買主相形之下，魁星天女可謂幸運之極，特雙馬因華南不動，價乃盤旋於一百五十一二萬間，其餘廿支各牌，亦跟漲二萬至四萬元，細紗及四十二支雙綫尙無大變化。</p>
<p>廠家收購甚力上檔白坯激漲</p>
<p>布市上檔白坯，因某廠收購，紡建昨開之藍V12磅細布准購單，加八千元，連續扒進，査龍頭細布未開出，而高檔做絲光士林需要甚殷，故有此高價，他如無牌彩球及無牌細布，仍少升降。</p>
<h3>股票交易漸旺　經紀人可能增加　中交派員辦理交割事官　永紗單位提高至五千股</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證券交易所股票交割事宜，自由中國交通兩銀行上海分行負責辦理以來，中國業已指定阮葭仙，交通業已指定陳慕唐，分別駐所辦公。同時，並由兩行借調職員一批，駐所處理交割事宜。</p>
<p>據悉：第二批尙待補具證件之經紀人，共達卅四名。一俟證件補充完備，即將呈部複核云。</p>
<p>又昨日各票開盤後，最初行市，無大起伏，惟新光交易櫃前，叫價踴躍，交易頻繁，成交亦多，十一時後，永紗美亞交易櫃前又呈活躍，永紗曾因賣戶拋出，行市一度下挫，旋因買方轉旺，行市方見轉機，收盤時較昨日略增，新光因有某銀行猛進八十餘萬股，並有認三送二之說，買氣大盛，行市迄未軟弱，麗安及華豐亦露向榮之勢，各大熱股於低後又有一度盤好局而，廣帮初進繼出，是以再有回好，無奈塲外斬多奇殷，前進遭阻，塲內又有北帮及錢莊帮斬多，近午境况仍疲，除新光等小股外，各股一致見低，臨收有補空獲利來進，略吿回穩，新光且以頂高盤結束，結果較前收計永紗微升，美亞稍挫，新光獨俏，漲起一成，景福勤興亦被帶好少許，較冷各股計絲業熒豐大通跌去半成，餘者升降俱微，塲外各股亦稍低落。</p>
<p>粽觀昨日市况，較前爲佳。成交總額共計五百四十六萬九千股，又昨日美亞成交單位，已自一百股增爲五百股，聞永紗單位，亦將自一千股提高爲五千股云。</p>
<h3>人造絲漲風更厲　比上日又高卅餘萬元</h3>
<p>人造絲漲風再接再厲。大有益發不可遏止之勢，昨上午一二〇號天橋有光開盤三百十五萬元，升十萬元收盤，下午更形混亂，最大喊到五十萬元，後首結果四十五萬元收盤，竟此上日大起三十餘萬元，雜脾有光，俱亦跟進，半光較呆滯，帶起二十萬元，廠經市况平穩，開口貨做好四五萬元，綢貨廠盤略高，銷路漸見起色，華錦縐去胃呆定，價較上日只大一百元弱，一般小型織綢廠，受人造絲高昂之打擊，勢將迫於停止之途。</p>
<h3>公債統丙略升</h3>
<p>公債雖有大戶二三家頗有納納胃，但以賣方積少成多，尙感壓迫，統丙晨開二一五〇元，曾扳高至二二五〇元光景，終以散多仍有了結，臨收復退落至二一〇〇元有零，結果較前收微升三十元，甲乙微挫二十元，丁種稍好三十元，而統戊則平，成交不下票面四百餘萬元。</p>
<h3>金鈔起仆甚徵</h3>
<p>烚赤昨買戶興緻見减，被迫微降晨開二一四萬光景，開後曾吿小穩，壓力小施，買戶知難而退，自二一四萬五起，賣意稍股，而吿下游，十時後央行以二一三萬之價，配給九六條，此後始終在二二三萬至二一三萬五之間盤旋，午刻曾吿微穩，一霎那間復挫落至二一三萬光景，午後即交曾退至二一二萬五左右，迨隔日交割開做又升至二一三萬以上，結果較前收微挫六千，飾金念二萬六，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆銀根仍鬆，息價在一角三左右。外幣尙形平和，美鈔晨開三三七〇元左右，後因金價小回，自三三八〇起漸漸下降，午刻退至三三五五元，午後微有進展，但少變化，結果較前收，挫落五元，港票情形不定，在七〇〇元內外頗多掙扎，結果較前收徵降五元，港匯六九三元至六九八元，印匯八三五元至八四〇元，英匯一一〇〇〇元至一一二〇〇元，成交不暢，美匯仍在掛牌價左右，對做亦少。</p>
<h3>糖價審議會決定　糖價減低一萬</h3>
<p>糖價　　會昨日議決中砂及生砂各减一萬元，其餘仍維持原盤</p>
<p>昨糖市平軟如前，中砂白再小一二千元，爲十四萬七千元至五千元，生砂十一萬四千五百元，普通靑糖四十一萬五千元，刁靑太吳輪有到。</p>
<h3>麵粉廠紛紛停車　成本每包二萬元　市價現僅售一萬四千元　弛禁無望公會明日集議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕麵粉業近因麥價高昂，每担市價達二萬三千元左右。而工資又貴，致麵粉製造成本，每包達二萬元。而市價每包則僅一萬四千元。生產結果，均吿虧蝕。然一方面，麵粉又遭禁運出口。故廣東·福建·靑島等地，雖需粉殷切，市價每包自二萬五千元至三萬元不等，仍無法自本市獲得麵粉。各地客帮原辦麵粉出口者，皆捨粉取麥。影響所及，京滬綫一帶中小型麵粉工廠，均吿紛紛停車閉歇。據記者調査所得，停歇各廠，本市有新康。江南兩家。無錫有順豐一家。崑山有五豐一家。蘇州有五豐·裕　·禾豐·大陸·公興等五家。此外大型麵粉廠，目前雖尙開車，惟多係代聯總磨製麵粉。工銀所入，可抵經常開支三分之二，故尙勉可維持。惟如麵粉業目前之不利情况，長此延續，則大型麵粉廠亦惟有出於停車閉歇之一途。現聞第四區麵粉工業同業公會，（包括蘇浙皖三省及京滬兩市之麵粉工業。）將於明日下午二時，召開理監事聯席會議，以便商討挽救辦法云。</p>
<h3>大戶收購英聯　外股市況轉好</h3>
<p>外股形勢雖仍疲軟，但因英聯突有某大戶力購甚鉅，得此助力，立吿回升，大股亦被帶上，但小股仍少新買活動，尙形不支，結果較前收計英聯漲起半成，怡紗會德豐業廣微升，鋼業航業平平，怡啤紙業微挫，祥泰仍多搜羅者，極爲穩定。</p>
<h3>烟煤塊堅挺</h3>
<p>煤市烟煤篩塊因煤商業聯合營業處接經濟部燃委會統配處口頭通知暫停配給浦東各棧烟煤塊，而浦西麥根路開潔煤棧之開平火車篩塊品質較次，故市價漸呈堅挺，惟烟煤屑市價仍平，白煤篩塊，漲價以來，銷路頗爲遜色，鴻基白煤屑，市况略見緊俏。</p>
<h3>上海市銀行　舉辦手工業貸款　每戶兩百萬利息五分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市市銀行，向本服務市民之宗旨，先後舉辦市公典貸款，及敎育貸金，近以小本家庭手工業，爲數衆多，此種手工業，大都資本短少，範圍狹小，特舉辦家庭工業貸款，以資扶助，其申請手續力求簡便，其章程及附屬文件，業經呈奉市政府核准，凡有固定地址，而有手工業設備之正當小本家庭工業，已加入同業公會者，均可向該行申請貸款，其數額，每戶最高爲二百萬元，利率暫定月息五分，照章並許分期償還，該行對於此項貸款，現正積極籌備，一俟就緒，即行開辦。</p>
<h3>洽定短期英滙價　免除出口商風險</h3>
<p>中央銀行除購辦打包放款外，近爲扶持出口商，又辦理開定短期英鎊外匯有效價格事宜，凡英鎊集團之外匯交易，該行決作後盾，以免受外匯價格暴漲暴跌之影響。其辦法爲：（一）出口商凡有出口物資欲運往英鎊集團國家交易者，可先就外匯酌定一合理價格，經中央銀行認可後，即爲有效，一俟國外交易後，外匯價格下跌時，中央銀行即按差額補給。（二）時間以一星期有效。（三）限定眞實出口商。據該行負責人語記者：本行對於出口事業，無不竭力扶持，凡有利於出口業者，均當設法求其實現，除美蒙外，其他外匯之漲跌情形，數日之間，變化極大，且以電訊遲緩，出口商常遭受意外損失，本行有鑒及此，特謀補救之道，凡出口商在規定有效期內，事前洽定之外匯合環價格，待交易成功，如外匯上漲，其所獲之利較多，可自由處理，事前之治無效。如外匯下跌，則由本行彌補其差額，出口商當可免受外匯價格暴跌之損失，預計國外電訊往來，交易至多一週可解決，故有效期爲一星期。其對象爲桐油，猪鬃，絲，茶等出口商，非眞實者，決于拒絕。</p>
<h3>米市平定小麥田順漲　油價已到審議價格以下</h3>
<p>昨米市早市人心堅挺，惟來貨蟬聯，登記總達七千餘石，收盤見疲，結果較昨粳米尙稱平定，秈米亦然，白元新元高貨略有零星交易，依然步跌二三千元，中下則無人問津，麵粉零消活玲，續升百餘元，小麥南洋消路轉暢，回漲六七百元，白麥北方去化不振，但存到兩少，價形挺秀，麩皮續降二三百元，汕價轉活，各油均到審議價格之下，零躉均不見旺，趨勢暫穩，黃豆本街各埠去路淡泊，中次仍少交易，苞米再跌千元，黃蓐漢口來貨甚多，步降一二千元，生仁疲而復振，回漲千元。</p>
<h3>新桂圓續有開出</h3>
<p>昨日泉州同安等新桂圓續有開出，較高者爲二十八萬元至二十七萬五千元，次之二十七萬至二十六萬元，廿五萬五千元，中橋十九萬五千元，陳貨十六萬元。</p>
<h3>駁船太少　交通阻滯　天津貿易未復舊觀</h3>
<p>糧價雖貴工資反較滬爲廉</p>
<p>頃據自津返滬本市金融界某君談及天津出口物資情形如下：猪　現居首位，爲我國出口大宗。他如皮張，草帽辮，地毯，腸衣等，亦有出口。核桃，杏仁，藥材，略有少數運到。至向佔華北出口貨中重要地位之羊毛及蛋類，現因天津與內地交通阻滯，到貨甚缺，加以羊毛之洗毛打包，蛋類之烘蒸，各種設備及廠房，尙未恢復，致離戰前標準尙遠。但各業人士，均在準備。一俟交通恢復，貨物湧到，即可漸復舊觀。</p>
<p>華北一般經濟情形，實較滬地爲佳。糧食市價，雖較滬爲昂。然工資反較滬低廉。此對出口貿易，殊爲有利。金融方面，亦感資金短絀。故銀根殊緊，暗息亦達一角至二角間，然投機心理，無滬市之濃厚。故金融市况，較爲平穩。</p>
<p>目前天津貿易最大之窒礙，不出兩點：（一）港口駁船太缺，外洋一來船，均無法如期卸貨。（二）內地一交通不暢，影響各地出口物資運津。所幸新港工程，正在努力進行，不久初期設備完成，二三千噸船隻，即可暢通，直靠天津碼頭。屆時至少轉口輪運，可以恢復已往狀况。此外內地交通治安，倘能逐漸改進，則整個華北之出口貿易，將佔全國對外貿易上重要之地位云。</p>
<h3>溫州陳紅猛漲</h3>
<p>紅綠茶內銷，本街店莊及蘇錫一帶依然活躍，且對於溫州陳毛紅，搜求尤烈，貨主再度高扳，行市迭破紀錄，每担竟叩七萬元大關，比前猛升萬餘元之鉅，大德昌茶葉公司吸進五十担，由益隆茶棧售出，其他花色一致屹立</p>
<h3>臺灣米　初次到滬　大批食糖同來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕臺灣糖。米，昨有到滬，均係招商局海寗輪自基隆裝來，昨日到滬，計食一糖六萬一千六百六十六包，白米一萬八千三百三十三包，本市食糖存底又有增加，臺米運滬尙爲初次，泊三十九·四十號浮筒起卸。又執信輪天津運來豆餅三千塊，烟葉六百十五桶，昨亦已抵埠。</p>
<h3>德貸出口了</h3>
<p>〔路透社史多茄脫十七日電〕在不久將來，德國將能輸出玩具，高級金銀飾品，玻璃器皿及精美之瓷器，此等物品均係德國南部所產，戰前在國外市塲上享有盛名。</p>

<h3>戰前存款增加給付合理歟（下）</h3>
<p>— 謝廷信</p>
<p>二，與非常時期過份利得稅條例所得稅法脫節判例內謂「銀行在其他方面投資莫不大增其貨幣之數額。」即使銀行因公債與放款以外之投資盈餘突增，但銀行之開支亦因物價昂漲而增加，銀行之開支亦由處理存款戶之事務而產生，亦爲正當成本之一種。如除開支外銀行尙有鉅額盈餘，則此項盈餘必須由國家征收相當數額之所得稅與過份利得稅。銀行「其他方面投資所增貨幣數額」之一部份，己經歸諸國家。且所得稅法與過份利得稅條例中，並無戰前債務必須預留準備，盈餘必須保留及剔除一部份之規定，換言之，立法方面無形中已確認銀行投資於其他方面所增貨幣數値爲銀行本身之盈餘，並無負債部份在內，而課以規定稅率，歸入國庫。如存戶必須計算幣値之損失，勢必由銀行重行註銷過去八年來之決算，國家再發還對銀行所徵之所得稅過份利得稅，從頭算起，始得事理之平。但所得稅法等亦是立法院通過，國府頒佈施行者，豈容輕易變更，此爲判決書內所忽視者二。</p>
<p>就事理言</p>
<p>三，銀行經營虧損存戶是否負擔判決書內判令銀行償付千倍之主要理由，因銀行「大增其貨幣數値。」反之，如銀行大减其貨幣數値，銀行對存戶是否得以减少給付。果能因銀行之盈餘影響銀行存戶之存款數額，則存戶不啻成爲銀行之股東，銀行且將每日決算盈虧，以便逐日對存戶淸算·同一數額之存款·存於甲乙兩銀行，其數額將因兩銀行經營成績不同而增减異趣。且可能全軍覆沒而無法向銀行追訴。存戶對銀行之權利與義務必須相平衡，不能僅着眼於權利，而忽於相反情境中之義務也。此爲判決書內所忽視者三。</p>
<p>四，按幣値給付之不可能幣値之變動，不僅戰時爲然，即在戰前從未有二年相同，二月相同，二日相同。承平時代與戰時僅爲程度上之差別而已。銀行每日有定期存款到期，勢必逐日按不同數額償付。銀行變成一幣値保險公司，與最近中央信託局創設之「物價指數團體保險」相類似。但存戶所接受存款契約，旣未載明幣値指數之償付，銀行經營所遵循之法規國家法令亦無對銀行有保全幣値措置之規定，欲於幣値大傾跌之後，責令銀行獨負其責，豈得謂平乎！再者，目前政府已自七月份停發鈔票，竭力抑平物價金價，果因局勢開展，措置得宜而幣値漸增，數年後銀行亦可能對存戶提出數年前存款减少給付之訴訟，亦以「旣非原吿所應負責，亦非原吿當時所能預料」爲詞，依據前述條例及司法院解釋，存戶亦將遭敗訴無疑。如此循環不息，經濟社會將永無安寗之日，銀行將僅以訴訟爲務矣。此爲判決書內所忽視者四。</p>
<p>總之吾國經此鉅變，受損者不知凡幾，發國難財者亦大有人在。銀行存款幣値之追償，僅一極小部份淸算，而以銀行爲淸算之對象，實屬謬誤，且將導經濟社會於紊亂之境。對過去無從淸算之淸算，實無補於今後經濟社會之建設者也。近聞政府對於戰前存款給付問題，已在擬訂折衷辦法，深望能考慮周詳，面面顧到，尤對於本文提出數點，加以注意爲幸。（完）</p>

<h3>清查不是宣撫　台省清查團驚人傑作</h3>
<p>— 特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>本報十三日台灣航訊</p>
<p>閩台區敵僞產業接收淸査團劉文島團長等一行，來台已四十餘日，先後在省都，台中，台南，高雄各地，實地調査各生產單位，並聽取民衆意見。最近以該團密査結果，毫無動靜，台北某報謂不是淸査而是宣撫，滬上某報則根據在公署演講評爲「歌功頌德」，可是在他行前十二日下午三時招待記者席上，却投下了個暴力彈：正式發表　靖公衆處分質易專賣兩局長于百溪和任維鈞，並移解法院，這說明了劉氏以謹愼和哀　的態度，發表了一鳴驚人的傑作、　證明了該團並不是宣撫。</p>
<p>檢舉兩個局長</p>
<p>專賣和貿易，是本省特殊化的特殊稱　，因爲事業的特殊，而也代表了台省的特殊，兩個機關因爲人事和技術上的不够，使外界議論紛紜，此次兩局長的被淸査團檢舉，據劉團長表示，是否是主管應得之罪，應受法律裁判·而他更透露了案件的底蘊是專賣局漏報了五萬萬噸的食鹽，貿易局則短報了三十種以上的大量接收物資。他特別鄭重地說明，淸査不僅以兩局爲對象，不過兩局已獲有具體的佐證·他們差不多用着和上海一樣的辦法，先公開徵求密吿，繼之取得有關機關的接收書面報吿，而在對照發現矛盾之下，而以報吿書作爲最有力的證據·</p>
<p>要求輿論支持</p>
<p>劉團長嚴正並激昂地闡明該團的立塲，力加說明對本地的當局沒有取得諒解甚至阿諛的必要，要是特有這樣意見的，根本就否認了劉氏的爲人，四十天內收文共三八四件，一部份涉及民本糾紛以及較輕微的交長官公署　理，全部案卷都得帶到首都聯合秘　處去，繼續接受並繼續辦理，必要時賡續派員來台實地調査·他說：當地政府的辦不辦，做得怎樣、都需要輿論支持，輿論具有超過軍事政治，經濟的力量！</p>
<p>接收情形特殊</p>
<p>鄭委員揆一和各委員都指出了台灣接收不同於國內的一點，是地屬孤島，統一接收在開始混亂的瞬間，易於貪汚，而過了此一時期，則爲省人側目，所以隱蔽大量物資，顯然是不可能的事·他竭力頌揚陳長官的廉明，　備司令部扣押了少將處長以下十餘人，法院也拘捕了若干人，都是在淸査團來台前後辦理的。記者詢以淸査團扣押了多少人，劉團長保持緘默，他說，截至目前爲止，數人而已。</p>
<p>他對於有意曲解他的演講的人，深表遺憾，但他說，因爲語言隔閡，發生誤會，致被挨罵，理該。本月十四日決定返滬轉京，行前他對記者保守秘密，該團在台工作上沒有受到阻力，但在臨行不希望多找麻煩，免滋意外。劉團長一行，辛苦的工作獲有成果，而他對貪污者則抱有一片哀矜的心情。</p>

<h3>設工藝廠收容乞丐</h3>
<p>逕啓者，近査市區徐家匯至林森中路一帶，沿途求乞滋多，尤其在小菜市塲間爲甚，有時順手牽羊，隨便到菜蔬　裏搶着就走。多數的被搶者，回到家裏，發覺東西被竊，咒駡　句，也就完事。倘若他是被主人差出來採辦的，那就有被受惡駡及惡打之虞。在這種不良現象之下，亟應請有關當局，將這批游氓，盡量予以收容，或驅逐出境。最好的辦法，是設立游民工藝廠，指敎他們以最簡單的小工藝，一面可改正市容，使外籍人士，在觀瞻方面，也比較稍爲好看些，並可促進小工業上進，多麽妥善啊。不過倡辦的話，經費相當浩大，須請本市巨商及大慈善家與政府合作辦理，才有成功的希望。我是一個工人，無力可施，只有將衷心愚見訴之大衆，希望當局予以採納，是亦社會之福也。（空允達）</p>
<h3>取締攤販應求澈底</h3>
<p>編輯先生：山西南路（自天津路迄寗波路）一段，攤販林立，自經警局下令取締後·不到三天·又死灰復燃，仍如舊觀，正不知有關當局作何感想，明令尊嚴，何處去矣、况此路爲商業集中點，銀錢薈萃地，車輛頻繁，交通時遭擠塞，行人殊感不便，臨路商店營業頗受影響，加以菜屑渣滓，堆塌滿地，尤衛生·　壤市容，務希當局堅決到底。（壽鼎）</p>
<h3>請禁衣莊晚間叫賣</h3>
<p>編輯先生：本市石路衣莊，大小的五十家，向來有叫賣之惡習慣，數月以前，奉當局命令禁止，近來有幾家小店，藐視法令，死灰復燃。又在高聲叫賣，甚至晚上八九點鐘，還可聽到此聲，不僅違反當局禁令，抑且擾亂公衆睡眠。（葉德心）</p>
<h3>取締影院黃牛黨</h3>
<p>編輯先生：上海很少有正當娛樂的地方，所以都以看影戲作消遣，但是黃牛黨就包辦了一切戲票，我忠誠地指出幾個大影戲院，眞可以說是黃牛黨的黨窠，他們很公開地在院中售票，很泰然地討價，甚至在我不買他的票時，他還來一個可惡的反議，他們有時還和戲院中的職員談談說說，看影戲的觀衆，不知有多少爲這批黃牛黨而奔波吃足苦頭呢？黑市是日本人統制時代的遺風，我們必須消滅它，我現在提議三點，謹請治安當局，考慮施行（一）當局飭便衣人員一赴戲院，很容易査察這批黃牛黨，有當局的監視，黃牛黨袋中大批戲票，便無法可銷。</p>
<p>（二）飭各戲院貼張不准觀客買黑市票的吿示，（這本來有的，可是現在已經撕去了）。</p>
<p>（三）院中職員假定有黃牛黨勾結的話，影戲院主管，應負責査辦。</p>
<p>上面所說的一切，全上海影院的觀衆，都可證明，其非妄言，或許市政當局者自己看影戲吃着黃牛黨的苦也說不定，但爲什麽熟視無覩呢？（聖的翰一學生）</p>

<h3>自由社會中的普通敎育</h3>
<p>— 沈有乾</p>
<p>哈佛大學委員會報吿書　（General　Education　in　a　Free　Society）　一九四五年哈佛大學出版　二六七頁　美幣二元</p>
<p>美國在一八七〇年全國中等學校學生不過八萬人，大學生不過六萬人。在一九四〇年，中學生多至七百萬人，大舉生多至一百五十萬人。（此外還有非全日制的職業學校與補習學校學生一百萬人。）在這七十年中，美國人口不過增加了三倍，而大學生增加了近三十倍，中學生增加了近九十倍。這數量上的增加是伴着品質上的變化的。學校爲適應各種學生的不同需要，不得不改變學校的課程，大大的增加學科的種類與數目。因爲地方的情形不同，（例如密西西比州敎師年俸平均五五九元，紐約州平均二六〇四元，相差近五倍。）學生的能力不同，（例如十三歲兒童之聰明者可比普通十六歲兒童，而其落後者不過相當於普通十歲兒童，相差達六年之多。）家境不同，展望不同，興趣不同，這種分科選課的發展是勢所必然，此後也必需繼續存在，但不免產生兩種危險：其一是學生之間難免隔閡，其二是學生所學不易貫通。因此首創選科制度的哈佛大學特組委員會，聘十二位敎授，費了三年工夫，六萬美幣，希望在變化無窮的課程中尋求共同的，一致的，一貫的普通中心。本書便是這委員會的報吿，</p>
<p>本書建議中學四年（按中國中學分初高中各三年，原係鈔自美國，惟美國學制不尙統一，三三制在中國通行已久，而在發源的美國迄未全國通行，所以本書所指仍是四年的舊制中學。）的課程中普通敎育應佔一半以上。一半的八分之三應屬人文學科，八分之三應屬自然學科，八分之二應屬社會學科。其餘的一半課程仍有一部份應屬普通敎育。凡不擬升學的學生，人文，自然，與社會三種學科每種應各再佔八分之一，而升學者則至少在這三種學科之一應有更進一步的研究</p>
<p>對於大學，本書的建議限於哈佛學院（可以說哈佛大學的文理學院），並未計畫其普通適用。四年十六門學程中，委員會認爲應有六門屬於普通敎育，其中三門是比較初步的，應在前二年修習，三門是比較高深的，應在後二年修習。高深的三門是可以自由選的，但限於特設的委員會所公認爲有普通敎育價値的學程，且必需不屬於學生所選的專修學系。初步的三門是特設的：一是「文學大著作」，一是「西洋思想與社會」，一是「物質科學要義」或「生物科學要義」。</p>
<p>但本書的主要貢獻並不在於課程的數量支配，因爲普通敎育與專門敎育的差別不在其內容，而在其方法與目的。普通敎育的目標是培養自由的人與公民，使能作有效的思考，能表達自已的思想，能下適當的判斷，能辨別一價値，能尊重眞理與尊重大衆的一幸福。</p>
<p>本書到處有精　的觀察，例如：「語文的訓練是所有敎師的共同任務」·「敎師　知其對於學生的影響並不限於其所敎的學科』。『外國文的學習，除了普通所公認的工具作用外，還有一種解放作用。…發現外國字的意義有爲本國字所不能直接表現者，…可能與哥白尼的發現有固等價値。」『通論式的學程自有其地位，且也相當重要，但其結果往往　塞學生的興　，不能刺激其好奇心而使其繼續研究。』『敎育如限於記憶些一知半解的零星條目，或以不費力的解釋替代細心的研究，是不會成功的。」「太多兒童名目聰得太多，學得太少。」</p>
<p>全　文筆也很優美，不像多數報吿書的官樣文章。有一處引了一長段孟子，（牛山之木嘗美矣）各委員之博學，於此亦可見一斑。</p>
<p>中國敎育在數量方面已開始激增，怎樣改進課程，以適應各種學生的不同需要，是當前一大問題。但現在大學的課程似乎已經過度專門化，尤其在文理學院，其目的旣與醫工等院以訓練專業人才爲務者不同，似乎對於普通敎育未够注意。本書可供硏究者參考。</p>
<h3>文學的基礎知識</h3>
<p>— 鄭家璦</p>
<p>一般愛好文藝的靑年，不管他是主修文科或是主修理科的，他們除了學校裏指定的敎科書和參考書以外，空閒的時候，大都喜愛閱讀些較輕鬆的作品，像小說，詩歌，劇本之類。對於那些沉悶的文學理論，多數是不去問津的；有些人一見什麽「主觀客觀」，「形式」，「本質」……等等抽象繁多的名稱，就有點頭痛；還有些人總算下了決心讀完一本厚厚的理論書；若是去問他一個所以然來，却又不知從何說起了；這種麻煩，並非靑年人不想讀牠，也不是書坊上沒有書，而是事實上缺少精良的，簡明的，容易爲靑年所接受的文學理論書藉。</p>
<p>不久以前，以羣著的「文學底基礎知識」，在這方面，他給了我們不少帮助；全書共分十二章，約有四萬字左右；閱讀起來相當輕便，現在略把牠的中心思想分別介紹如下：</p>
<p>（一）文學的本質—文學是生活現實的反映；高爾基說：「文學的任務，是反映事物及描寫勞動的生活，將眞理現於形象一一人物性格和典型之中。」這僩界說不僅說明了文學底本質和特性，同時也標示了牠和哲學科學的區別。</p>
<p>（二）文學底藝術性和社會性一近百年來的文學爭論中，「純粹一文學」和「社會文學」的調和與一矛盾，是一個爭持不決的問題，直到現在，還沒有看見眞正的終結底微象，可是依新藝術諭者的意見，他們並不將文學的「藝術性」和「傾向性」，看做對立的，而是將牠看做從文學本身出發的一種性質，文學的社會傾向並不會歪曲現實，或是損害藝術，而是和藝術的眞實性相一致的。</p>
<p>（三）文學和現實—文學必須以現實爲根據，以現實爲出發點，同時還要征服現實，戰勝現實，站在現實之上，看出牠的前途，並給予槪括的表現。</p>
<p>（四）題材和主題—題材是客觀現實底獨立存在，不和作家底主觀有所關涉，而主題則是經過作家主觀認識的事物；題材一經被作家選爲主題，他的意　就被發掘出來了。一個創作者，能應擴大自己的視野，從多變的現實各方面，攝取創作的題材，豐富自己文學的思想了，同時充分發揚題材的廣泛性和主題的多樣性。</p>
<p>（五）文學的創作方法—同樣的題材，經過兩個世界觀不同的作家的處理，便會產生出完全不同的意義，這種決定事物的觀察法和感應法，在文學上就叫做「創作的方法」。從題材到主題，必須經過「方法」的橋樑，一個創作者的世界觀並非由於他所出身的家庭背景來決定的，而是被他投生的社會所决定。</p>
<p>（六）浪沒主義—高爾基說過：「文學上兩種基本的潮流或傾向，便是現實主義和浪漫主義。」浪漫主義於十八世紀末葉至十九世紀初葉，盛行於歐洲，以德國最爲發達，歌德與席勤，就是這種主義的開路人，他們提倡人性的崇拜和人類理想的主義，偏重幻想與個人的放縱享樂；英國的浪漫主義却不是這樣單純；牠可以分爲二種傾向：一是消極派——他們的特點在表現純粹的個人放縱，過往的追懷與自然憧憬；對現實的態度是隱遁，退避；這一派的代表人物有華慈華斯（Wordworth）和斯高德（Scott）。另外一派是積極派——他們的特點在反專制，王政和暴壓；他們有改造世界的熱情，要追求自由和解放；並對現實宣戰；這一派的代表人物是雪萊和拜倫。二派之間的區別，簡單說來，前者是拉住現實，而後者是推進現實</p>
<p>（七）現實主義—現實主義的文字，創始於十九世紀初葉，盛行於十九世紀末葉；以有產階層的勃興爲發端。他創於法國的斯丹速（Shanghai）和巴爾扎克；巴爾扎克雖專注重現實生活的塲面，但仍免不了虛想和主觀的誇張；其實現實主義眞正的創始者，却是福祿貝爾，他純然以客觀的態度，冷靜地模仿事物，完全拒絕藝術家的狂熱；左拉就是以他爲師範的。這一派的作品，雖在暴露資本主義的社會黑暗，可惜作家的社會地位，限制了他們的發展；因此祇止於暴露和批判，而不能看出牠的前途和出路。</p>
<p>（八）新現實主義—這一派主義的創作方法，是克服現實的純主觀的浪漫主義，和純客觀的現實主義；牠是以新進階層的立塲爲基點，貫澈作家的主觀和社會的客觀；而把握現實的眞實；他們的目的是在鼓起讀者的熱情和勇氣，向着尙未實現的裏想作鬥爭</p>
<p>（九）文學的概括性—作家必須從現象中，除去特殊的偶然部分，着重牠的普遍性和必然性，從個別的現象中，提出他的本質—這就是由實際的「事實」，到藝術的「眞實」的過程，文學的眞實性祇有從這裏才能發現。</p>
<p>（十）文字的语言（文字）—文學是藉語言來表現的，離開了語言，就沒有文學。文學的語言不就是日常的口頭語，而是經過作家選擇，改造和洗練後的正確語言；但在某種塲合下，爲了要使人物顯得格外生動逼眞，民衆口頭语是須要應用的，甚致地方的土语也不能缺少。</p>
<p>（十一）文學的形式——內容和形式是文學不可輕視的要素；一件優秀的文學作品，在這二方面必須配合得適切，並且是這然統一的；如果單注意形式的美，那就是在用來「掩蔽精神的簡單和貧乏」罷了。因此一個作者，他應在形式上力求單純和明瞭，而不是富麗或巧　。今日文學的體裁大致可分爲四糧：1小說（長篇，短篇與中篇）2詩歌（叙事詩，抒情詩和史詩）3戲曲（多幕劇與獨幕劇）4報吿文學·</p>
<p>（十二）學底遺產丁新現實主義的文字，必須廣泛地吸收各種文學遺產，所謂接受，並非是模仿和無條件地學習特點；而是以自己主觀的批判態度，從世界文學的遺產中，篩除渣滓，提取精華，再經過消化作用，使它成爲營養自己的血液，開拓自己前徐的發展。</p>
<p>「文學底基礎知識」雖祗是薄薄的一本小書，全長不到二百頁；可是作者却爲牠花了不少心血；他要參考許多世界文藝名著，和文學理論書；去分析牠們，比較他們，再經過詳密的思考後才能有系統地寫下的；他在解釋一件現象時，常常舉出實例來，這不但使我們容易了解，並且還可以調和一下沉悶的氣氛；譬如他在比較「現實主義」作品的風格時，他就把福祿培爾的「波華利夫人」和巴爾扎克的「從妹貝德」各舉出一段來，讓我們閱讀。這樣我們便深切地領悟了，並且還可以欣賞一下文藝名著。</p>
<p>本書各章後面，附有簡短的問題，這是很適合個別自習，或是小組討論研究用的。此外，各章附註的參考書目，使我們熟習了不少偉大的文藝書藉，這可算爲收穫外的「收穫」了。</p>
<h3>批評與賞鑑</h3>
<p>— 朱力</p>
<p>有人曾經這樣提過一個意見：批評家必須也是一個作家或曾經有過創作的經騐。這個意見是對的，但不能把它變成公式。</p>
<p>一個作家在他的著作里面有他的風格和判斷，自然難免主觀的成分；在一篇作品里面有他的涵養和見解。批評家執着他自己的標準對任何作品給予同樣的批判，不僅給作者以一種誣蔑，同時也給了讀者一個公式化的觀念，損害了作品的價値也左右了讀者的賞鑑。</p>
<p>主張一個批評家同時也是一個作家的理由，就是希望在批評某一作品的時候會體味到作品產生的過程，從賞識到批判，融合在一個情境里面。這樣；以欣賞作爲批判的基礎，對作品感覺喜愛，批判也就審愼了。創作是自由的，一個敎育家也可能是一個文學家，他的作品或許在兩方面的表現完全不同。一個批評家，以他某一方面的特長或創見來批評作品，這是一個專家的賞鑑，對於高深的理論或硏究的指摘和修訂，這是需要的；但對於初學習作則應寬放尺度加以愛護。</p>
<p>一個批評家不必是一個作家，但必須是一個賞鑑家，他熱讀對於某一方面的作品，能够了解作品的內容也懂得作者的苦心，他愛別人的作品勝於愛他自己的。這棵的批評家，不會以他自己的主觀和公式來衡量一部作品，也不會強使讀者走上他的觀念之路。</p>
<p>批評與鑑賞不同，批評家可以作爲賞鑑家，賞鑑家不一定是批評家。多數的讀者都是賞鑑家，他們從一部著作或一篇作品中去認識作者，欣賞作品，從那里得到敎育和指示；他們毋須對某一作品批判，但他們也有他們的賞鑑標準。賞鑑家對於作品的欣賞，一方面是作品的價値對他的感應，另一方面是他自己的了解程度：一篇諷刺作品有人當它笑話是根據了解程度而來的。</p>
<p>批評家必須是一個賞鑑家，不必是一個作家，因爲他熟愛別人的著作，同情作者的創造，在賞鑑中提出他的意見，這就是他的批評；對作品提出消極的指摘或積極的贊美，這是批評家的任務。</p>
<h3>文化論</h3>
<p>— 沈立人</p>
<p>吳文藻主編　社會學業刊甲集第一種</p>
<p>Bronislaw　Malinowski著　費孝通等譯　商務印書館印行　三十五年五月滬版</p>
<p>所謂文化，在靜的觀點看來，是人類的生活態樣；在動的觀點而言，是指示人類征服自然所表現出的成績程度。從其內涵的意義去追究，那麼廣義的，便是所有的常識和智識的形成及堆累；而狹義的文化觀，便是說明學術研究之進境了。</p>
<p>學術的硏究，有從總的分化成各類的專門部分，如理化之蛻變爲諸種不同的支歧科學等；亦有從零碎的理論體系，抽擇歸納而併合成另一共同的學科，如政濟學經濟學之漸形發達便蛻導出社會學來叙述其通性然。到現在，社會科學一方面，從社會學的創出後，已將整個的社會科學的共同綱領提絜起·但是在自然科學上，尙沒有一綜錯的高層學識結構，不過說明整個人類的智識發展過程的所謂「文化學」，却在萌芽茁長，雖然還僅不過停滯在範疇的確限和名詞的酢酌階段，可是亦足以看出各位前進學者的努力一般，以前，連貫於自然科學與社會科學之問的，只有一極不完備的「人類學」，是略微講到人類的進化的，而今有了較高超的「文化學」，才可認爲是自然和社會二大科學合流的先聲和雛型。</p>
<p>只是當「文化學」尙不足敎育成一獨特的科學時。他不得不附隷於社會學之下，而作爲一門硏究人類的智識發展的導論，這就是本書之所以屬於「社會學叢刋」之一的原因。社會學叢刋是吳文藻博士的偉大嘗試，在他的計劃中，一共有三大集，其目的在研究社會學之中國化問題，及供給基本的社會學參考書，而「甲集」，便是專純硏究社會學的理論與方法的。</p>
<p>本書的作者馬林諾斯基是當代社會學功能派的權威，他對人類的看法，不單從自然的進化論着手，亦不單從歷史的分析而論斷，却是認爲文化一端，是人類生活手段的重合，其目的，只在滿足日常生活所需要，他在好幾個社區作過全盤精密的實地觀察，出版過好多部經典似的劃時代著作，太書只不過一極簡單的一篇基礎論文。</p>
<p>在這書中，很經濟地討論到所有文化組織的重要緣圍，並且是用啓蒙的筆觸來抒叙着。起先，他講述文化的差異性，因了傳統的嗣系，或地城的參錯，而後才建立各支雜亂的文化路綫，接着，就說明文化的一般原則，並用新的類分法，將文化的每方面納入一獨立的單位。再後經過對於文化科學下一樸素的定語後，便提出功能主義的旗幟，申白作者的文化觀之立塲，再略一關連到文化的作用。以下的六章，是硏究文化的社會部分，關於社會制度的形式，功能，和組合，其基本的演生性質，文化迫力及儀式活動等等。再下面是硏究奇異字詞，那是從事討論文化中的精神部分的具體方法。最後零碎地逐一地考騐精神文化的起源和進步。在這似乎不可分割的三部門間，連貫着一致的物質條件，在文化中居留一重要的地位·末了是「槪要和結論」，斷定經騐的文化論之價値，因爲人們不僅是需要了解文化的起因，並且應知道文化是什麽，怎樣發生，如何變遷；那麽，才能深入文化的實質，而改造文化，使能符凑人類所期待着的文明。當然，全是功能派的立論。</p>
<p>這長長的本文中，最講得　善的是關於巫術問題，連帶地從巫術的生理基礎，過渡到宗敎信仰和其功能，是在其他討論同一問題的著作中所不易得到的詳細解　和臆念。</p>
<p>剩下本書三分之一，吳文藻博士的「論文化表格」，是相應於文化論一段的補充著作。他所說明的盡是些最原始的文化論綱領，差不多全在解釋文化三因子分法的價値和實踐，且涉到文化八原素的叙述。所謂文化因子的三分法，即是熔合了馬克思的物質一元論，黑格爾的精神一元論，杜爾幹的一社會一元論，而得到的進一步的立說，將物質，社會，精神三者併合成一元，指明其中的關繫性和不可分徧性。太書若缺少這一部分，便會使得讀者祇獲到片斷的智識而無法貫通。</p>
<p>要創立一完備善美的「文化學」，自然更須有志於學者的苦功，但在這書，也多少可看到一些大槪的影形，若進一步地去補充和整理，怕也不致於是一件永遠只能待望的事罷！</p>

<h3>論文藝與現實</h3>
<p>— 陳默</p>
<p>在未談文藝與現實的相互關係之前，我們不妨先對它倆的個別含義作一個　略的說明：</p>
<p>什麽是文藝？這個問題很難作具體而確切的答覆，不過根據一般的意見是這樣的；文藝是假借抽象的文字符號（或語言）爲表現工具與手段的藝術。它的特殊功能是以形象化的方法，反映社會的現實，發抒作者的思想和情感，而又表現作川於現實的改進。</p>
<p>什麽是現實？就是現代眞實的實在。不是過去的陳舊的歷史，也不是未來的美麗的夢幻，而是當前的血肉淋漓的眞實的事像。再深一　講，現實就是歷史發展的　實的縱面，和社會生活發展的　實的橫面所組成。</p>
<p>文藝是現實的反映，是作者思想情感的發抒。而現實却是文藝的廣大的採汲泉源，是作者思想感情的孕育聖地</p>
<p>假如沒有又藝，現實便失掉了時代的色，光，力而顯得貧弱，庸俗，冷愴！</p>
<p>假如沒有現實，乾脆的就沒有又藝。最少是沒有時代價値與生命活力的文藝花朶！</p>
<p>文藝取之現實，而又改進現實。現實供給文藝，又因受了文藝的改進而更充實了文藝。這樣相互的循環與相互的演進下去，於是現實的時代不斷地向前發展，現實的文藝亦不斷地光華燦爛！</p>
<p>但是現實並不等於文藝，而文藝並不就是現實。</p>
<p>因爲現實所包含的各種現象是非常雜亂的，粗俗的，而文藝所表現的是純粹的，洗煉的，如像焹鐵鍜鍊成的純鋼，亂絲紡織成的錦　。</p>
<p>現實的現象是時時刻刻在變幻的，而文藝所表現的却是固定不變的，永垂不朽的。</p>
<p>現實的本質是潛藏的，晦暗不明的，而文藝所表現的是鮮明的，顯露的。</p>
<p>現實給予人們的映象是亂雜的，分歧的，而文藝所表現的却是統一的，一致的。</p>
<p>因爲一切文藝的目的，都是在反映真實的現實的本質與時代的重心，更指引人類遷向真，善，美的生活的夢境；但是這個文藝的最高的目的如何才能去完成它？也即是說，怎樣才能够把現實的本質與時代的重心恰到好處的反映出來？這，作者就必需要先去作一個眞實不假的人，去進求眞實不假的生活，在眞實的生活裏邊去追求生活的真實，去追求人生生命的眞實，更從廣大人民的心裏去找找尋生活中的偽理，社會時代的眞理！</p>
<p>又因爲一個完形的文藝作品是作者把客觀的現實題材溶灌主觀的思想情感而後通過藝術形式所產生。道，又牽連到作者主觀思想的正確與表現技巧的勁鍊了。</p>
<p>更深一層講，文藝的現實與否，單憑它的題材是不能判斷的，最主要的還在題材所包含的主題是否有建設性，積極作品；內在性，現實性所寄予的靈魂是否生動而美麗，偉大而茁壯！</p>
<p>所以說文藝與現實的關係除了其題材重要有現實性而外，最主要的決定因素還在文藝作品內在的靈魂與主題的現實與否。</p>
<h3>「酒場」及其作者</h3>
<p>— 李慧</p>
<p>左拉在小說「酒塲」裏寫一個悲劇女角瑟爾緋絲和當時巴黎男工的二種類型，終日泥醉的古波藍恬與慨然憂世的古熱。</p>
<p>瑟爾緋絲在十四歲上就與製一帽工人藍恬生了兒子的緣故，被家庭所遺棄。等到藍恬的一點點有限的家產完了的時候，又被不務正業而必須酒醉飯飽烟過癮的丈夫一脚踢離。她就受勞耐苦洗衣裳來扶養孩子並建立了一個新的愉快的家庭。但是新家庭裏的組成份子洋鐵匠古波也是一個酒醉飯飽烟過癮的角色，做工的收入不够他的開支，加上藍恬的厚臉，重人了家庭，馬上又把瑟爾緋絲辛勤建立的家業吃光用光。藍恬自然又漂流到另外的女人那裏去了，古波中了酒瘋而死，瑟爾緋絲除了給兒子去學生意了之外，自己勞瘁了一生，終於被貧窮與寂寞漸漸地拖死。</p>
<p>在瑟爾　絲與藍恬離開而與古波結合的時候，同時結識了　年工人古熱。古熱是熱情的共和黨人。我們在歷史書上可以知道當時正逢法蘭西第一共和的滅亡第二帝政的開始，巴黎工人們冒着砲火得來的一綫光明已經被淹沒，有志的工人正在焦灼與苦悶中度着受難的日子，古　除了時局的苦悶之外·又加上了愛人的　種複雜的問題，他的窘境自概可想見。瑟爾緋絲非常同情他，希望能够擺脫丈夫孩子而與古熱私奔，但是心有餘而力不足，最後而大家被生活拖着，拖過了靑春，拖過了壯年，一直到藍恬他適古波死去的時候　爾緋絲已經潦倒在酒塲與夜街上了·一切的理想虛幻不可即，就這樣造成了大家都失戀的悲劇。</p>
<p>在酒塲裏，只有藍恬是達　的。吃光了瑟爾緋絲的，就漂到亞德兒那裏，瑟爾緋絲振作了起來，又來吃瑟爾緋絲的，又光了，就又漂到了維幾妮那兒去了，他沒有什麽可以躭心的，只要他還有玩弄女人的本領。</p>
<p>但是，當然，無論藍恬，古波，古熱和瑟爾緋絲的最後命運是一樣的，恰像所有巴黎的工人區的大多數工人們的生活，從童年的無知活到了那塊低矮的天地中來之後，就必須勞瘁一生不可能改善他們的生活而只有隨着精力的被剝光便頽然倒下，無論你在活着的時候是如何想好的壞的都一樣。</p>
<p>我們知道左拉是一個寫實主義的作家，他對於他的藝術作品要求的是注重事實的硏究，注重實騐。他爲了要寫一個僧侶，他就到僧院裏去居住，他爲了要寫病人，他就先到病院裏去觀察病室的狀况，價目，窗外的風景甚至外來的一切聲響等等。他是希望他的作品能够精確地寫出他所處的社會的眞實。</p>
<p>酒塲的悲慘的塲景與薄命的人物，顯然從中就有着左拉的思想與希望。左拉與瑟爾緋絲，與古波古熱藍恬，一樣生活在第二帝政時代的巴黎，他的身歷其境的感受顯然激動了他的正直的靈魂，他對於上了當的工人們有了極大的同情，但是爲了他對於受一難者的深汎的悲憫，他更認眞地一批判了他們的可悲的行爲。他借古熱的口氣指着巴黎說：</p>
<p>「人們總不外是在那裏作些不中用的事情，民衆們有一天或者是要後悔自己的袖手傍觀的·」古波與藍恬就是置身於苦痛的社會中受難的自覺的傍觀者，瑟爾緋絲是想吃苦耐勞，一手抬起社會的大閘而終被閘下來慘死的不自覺的傍觀者。古波的死亡，瑟爾緋絲的死亡，都明顯地說明了傍觀者的悲劇正是由於他們的傍觀而將不斷地遺傳給他們的後代。這，十五歲的娜娜就開始去做娼婦便是一個明白的暗示·</p>
<p>當然，左拉沒有在酒塲裏就刺目地提出要古波他們馬上行動起來及如何行動的主張，他是一個僅僅是注重實騐的作家，他只要吿訴世人，巴黎的貧民窟是怎樣的，他們在怎樣像　爾緋絲似地賣力，藍恬似地滑頭，古渡似地放蕩，古熱似地熱情，他們的遭遇都那麽悲慘，而他們却怎樣不知道去撲滅那不幸而正在遺傳那不幸。他只不過說：他們將要後悔的。</p>
<p>左拉是虛心的，他只想把自已的材料供人硏究。因此，瑟爾緋絲　給讀者的同情而格外强大了。雖然他們已經死了，好像他們尙在後悔中。</p>

<h3>赤脚人　（速寫）</h3>
<p>— 葉紅</p>
<p>大熱天，柏油路面蒸得軟綿綿的，差點沒冒出烟來。</p>
<p>路旁一排排濃陰，遮不住熱浪的侵襲，空間一切顯得異常寗靜，只有躱在樹葉中的知了還自顯自的拉長了嗓子，拚命地嘶鳴。</p>
<p>突然遙遠的傳過來：</p>
<p>隆隆隆隆………………</p>
<p>漸漸的，兩個赤膊漢子拖了一輛塌車走近來，車上堆着幾十隻大西瓜，綠油油的西瓜皮，和那漢子給陽光炙得黑里泛紅的上身，形成極鮮明的對照</p>
<p>漢子當中一個花白頭髪的老頭兒，嘴里乾的快要　火，他咬緊牙關，狠狠地再拖了幾步就停下來，一而喘着氣，一手在腰帶上拉下那條發黃的白毛巾，衝着頭臉一陣亂擦，接着就向另一個年靑的漢子瞟一下眼睛：</p>
<p>「水壺，快！」嗓子有點發啞，鼻孔內給體溫薰得怪疼。</p>
<p>年靑的漢子慢吞吞的爬上塌車，在西瓜下面翻呀翻的，翻出一個扁水瓶來，靠在耳朶邊用勁的搖兩搖，遞給那老頭兒。</p>
<p>老頭兒猛的把木塞子一拔，瓶口對着嘴巴就一陳子直灌，好容易，好容易才透了一口氣：</p>
<p>「喂——」停一停，把　車的皮帶朝看勃子上一套：「走吧！」</p>
<p>「爺叔怎麼不再歇歇？」年靑的漢子翻着眼睛。</p>
<p>「再歇歇？」老頭兒的臉上浮出一絲苦笑：「你看什麼時候，太陽偏西了，趕生意要緊，吃這行苦飯，就顯不得辛苦……；唉！」</p>
<p>老頭兒像一匹疲乏的老馬，使出全身氣力，拖着塌車，一步一步地向前捱，年靑漢子在車後推着，車輪重壓着又軟又燙的路面，隨着車輪滾出兩條粗痕。</p>
<p>路邊有幾個赤條精光的孩子，圍在一個破的自來水龍頭旁沖凉，水嘩喇嘩喇的湧出來，孩子們本的直跳，他們看見一塌車的西瓜拖過來，幾條視綫不約而同的朝塌車一掃：</p>
<p>「西瓜，看大西瓜！」</p>
<p>這輛塌車隆隆隆的又過去了·</p>
<p>塌車拖過幾條馬路，老頭兒又要停下來喝水了，忽然從路旁閃出兩個穿黃制服的傢伙。</p>
<p>一個穿黃制服的高個子大吼一聲：</p>
<p>「那裏去？」</p>
<p>「到……到徐家匯。」老頭兒連忙展開笑容，怪可憐的抖着嗓子。</p>
<p>「規矩，懂不懂？」另一個傢伙兩手叉着腰，眼睛要彈出來。</p>
<p>「這個……這個……」老頭兒摸着自己的屁股，老半天「這個」不出來。那個高個子睜圓兩隻眼睛盯着一個大西瓜，以閃電的手法捧了就要走…………</p>
<p>老頭兒不斷的打拱作揖：</p>
<p>「先生，可憐可憐我們吧！少一只要吃賠帳的！謝謝你！」高個子頭一昂：</p>
<p>「少廢話！」拔開大步就走。</p>
<p>老頭兒一手拉着那件黃制服，差不多要跪下來。</p>
<p>「先生，可憐我們這種人，實在賠不起………」</p>
<p>「媽的，你們這些赤脚人眞不識相，撒手，不要拉衣服！」</p>
<p>「求求你……………</p>
<p>猛然拍的一聲，一張巨靈之掌朝着老頭兒的臉上搧來，老頭兒覺得眼睛一陣黑，金星直在眼前飛舞，再也支不住，一交摔下地去。</p>
<p>年靑的漢子連忙把他扶起來，他換着火辣辣的左頰，定睛一看，黃制服早已無影無踪。</p>
<p>老頭兒憤　地喃喃着：</p>
<p>「赤脚人！赤脚人！…突然破口大喊：「赤脚人不是人！」</p>
<p>他怔怔的站了很久，長歎一聲：</p>
<p>「走吧！快到了，算我們今天倒楣！」</p>
<p>天空的火球不覺已滾下地平綫，這兩個赤脚人的影子漸漸的在暮靄中消失………………。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　37</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>就在這樣的時運之中，他早娶了一位子孫太太，于來年裏而，給他添了五口家丁；開頭是一枝花，緊接是一顆果，又是一枝花，又是一顆果。最後又是一朶小丁香。這名叫隔花生，一女一男等等。第六位少君未竹來到之前，他忽然改變方針，做了山額夫人的信徒，實行節育運動。所以小丁香到了七八歲，那第六位少君仍未出世。</p>
<p>無論從那一方面看，這位工程師是一位不折不扣的「家庭第一」主義者。換句話說，對於妻室，他是一位模範丈夫；對於子女，他是一位模範家長。自己寗可少吃省穿，可總讓孩子吃得飽飽的，穿得暖暖的。敎育？那常然要讓每個孩子都進學校，按年齡受相當的敎育。他常說「哪怕窮的餓飯呢，孩子不能讓他們失學。」</p>
<p>大約也就是爲了牽東補西，張羅孩子們的衣食敎育，所以不到四十歲，頭髮已經花白了，腰幹也有些堅不直了。可是大致還不見衰老。瞧他仍舊穿着雪白府紬長袖襯衫，袖口捲我小臂上，白帆布短褲，挺厚的白羊毛長統襪，綠絲襪帶，加上半寸來長的縱子，拖在捲口外邊。皮鞋雖說已經上了年紀，縐紋重疊，好幾處大有裂口的趨勢，然而却是擦得光滴滴地。這一身打扮，畫出了一個英國紳士的勁頭。</p>
<p>他雖是滿而愁容，要我給他拿一個主意；可是他的文章主題，還藏在文章的後半段裏，叫我根據什麼給他拿主意呢？我知道他早染上了一半「渭嘴子」，一半「京油子」的調調，說起話來，先得繞上好幾個大圈，旁敲側懸，除非您眞能放過話頭，抓住話尾，替他把題目點醒，他還得再繞上幾個大圈。</p>
<p>「老吳，您饒饒我，給我一個題目罷」我求着，「你不給題目，叫我拿什麽主意？」</p>
<p>「嗐，」他大大的嘆了口氣，意思說「你這糊塗蛋」。他楞起了眼睛，「麼怎說？……您可是『泥菩薩點金！裝糊塗』。瞧您，昨日一宿，那們大砲喧天，比過年還熱鬧，您就不躭一點心事？」</p>
<p>明白了。可還只算明白了一小半，那就是說，大槪他的主題，與戰事有關。再回想他剛才說的，「您這光桿兒，……我一家老小」等等，也許是想討論一個戰時中的安全問題？</p>
<p>「吳大哥，您可是說這畏辛店不大安全嗎？」</p>
<p>「對呀！」他拿手黨在大腿上重重的拍了一下，「可是您只說了一半哪，……像我這一家，兩口老的，五口小的，不早點想個辦法，……難說就這麽混下去？……也要混的過去呀，不是嗎？」聲音都有點岔了。再讓他說下去，也許要傷心落淚了。</p>
<p>這却不能怪他。別的不管，先說他的幾個孩子：大小姐梅君—他這替孩子題名，就包含一種工程設計；女的，梅君蘭君竹君，大概預備不久還有第四位千金「菊君」，凑成一套。兒子是士仁，士義；這是已經兌現了的；預約的交易中，大約還有士禮，士智；也許還有士信。這種名字排法，倒是有些伸縮性，是個聰明辦法。萬一只有兩個兒子，當然只是仁，義，就可站住。要是四個，「仁義禮智」，也是成套的。假使再饒上一個零碎，「仁義禮智信」不也是一套嗎？萬一只有三個？不然，我想他很有把握，太太方面不成問題，他本人方面，那只要環境好，也可不成問題。</p>
<p>梅君現在是十七歲，不用說長的如何美，只說她在校就是一朶校花，回到長辛店，簡直是一朶奇葩，不，簡値是深山幽谷中的一枝靈芝。畏辛店一帶，不是也有好幾千人口嗎？就說女性吧、村的俏的，醜的俊的，也不在少數哪，可就沒右像梅君這樣一位頂兒尖兒的。</p>

<p>窗前的梧桐樹葉，在一陣風中便跌落三兩片，季節轉換了。凉秋九月，塞外草衰，江南雖仍樹綠花紅，但寒意襲來，蕭索之象漸露。</p>

<p>氣候變成了生活的點綴、甚至變成了生活的炫耀。自然，也不乏感到壓迫和威脅的人，而這些人爲數却也不在小。</p>
<p>要哪一種人看長白山松花江呢？連蘇北也不敢正視罷！就在這幾天的參議會中，不是提供了我們身邊的許許多多問題嗎？</p>
<p>與其善後，不如善前，天氣冷了，爲今年冬季着想，大家該趁早考慮一下即將來到的幾種嚴重情形；與其政府，不如人民，（政府還是靠人民，政府的力量，實在也有難以週到之處，）一切我們自己勇敢地承担下來，計劃出妥善解決的辦法。</p>

<h3>新聞資料　將成東北共軍總部的　合江省會佳木</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>提起佳木斯，一定有許多人對這個地名感到有些陌生。誠然，這個僻處在松花江畔的城市，十五年來，沒有得到它底消息，淪陷期間，在上太國地理課的時候，也讀不到它的名字，難怪大家一向對它不大熟悉。</p>
<p>但這城市就將成爲大家注意的目標了。因爲：東北國共的戰事，共方形勢逆轉直下，駐守哈爾濱的共軍，已將大量軍備運往佳木斯。照最近的趨勢，佳木斯即將成爲共軍在東北的新總部。</p>
<p>現在，讓我把佳木斯作一個簡略的介紹：</p>
<p>佳木斯是合江省的省會，在省境中央松花江南岸，離哈埠東北二百哩。淸宣統時在這裏置過樺川縣，後來因爲水患，移到悅來鎭。（即今　川縣治。）</p>
<p>佳城交通極便。航運在松花江上可行千噸左右的船舶，上駛哈埠，下航黑龍江合流點。陸路交通，有圖佳·綏佳·兩條鐵路，從五八〇公里外的圖們和二八二公里外的綏化迤邐銜接於此，同時又是哈埠到撫遠公路的中心站。此地在僞滿時代的航空交通，有到富錦。哈爾濱。依蘭三綫。</p>
<p>敵人的刻意經營，使佳城工廠勃興，市廛大增，也成爲東北大都市之一。而造成佳城繁榮的因素，除了上面所說交通上的優越條件外，是附近農產的豐富。　城附近一帶松花江流域，沃野千里，一望無際，盛產豆類和麥類。以前日人覬覦東北時，曾用武裝來屯墾這帶地區，也可見這裏物產的豐富了。</p>
<p>佳城原有一所僞滿「國立佳木斯醫科大學」，共二學級，學生有一百五十七人。勝利後去接收，不料那座學校名爲「滿洲國」的「國立大學，學生却都是日本人沒有理由再讓它繼續開辦，便把它停閉了。在僞滿時代佳城的中等學校也有佳木斯師道學校，省立佳木斯國民高等學校，佳木斯高等女學校等七所，所施行的敎育當然完全是「友邦作風」</p>
<p>那裏天氣甚冷，全屬大陸性氣候，夏季極短，最熱的時候也不過華氏八十度，但是在冬天最冷時，溫度常達零下二三十度。每年七月，已是凉雨颼颼，八月中草木凋零，九月就要飛降大雪，杯花江中也要結冰，其上人馬可以暢行。現在東北天氣已冷，遙想松花江畔，有人爲了爭地盤，迄仍烽烟紛起，到處廝殺，眞令人洶起無窮的感慨！</p>
<h3>好話</h3>
<p>— 索</p>
<p>不應自滿，但應知足；自滿是在智識與能力方面，以爲自己已了不起，知足是在物質生活方面，應知有所限制，儿事能退一步想。能如是，則你的智能日漸增强，而物質慾望，知所節制；那麽，智識與快樂跑進了你的血液·</p>
<h3>時間就是錢</h3>
<p>— 凌雲</p>
<p>我們中國人的門檻雖不及猶太人那末精明，但討價還價的木領一定超人一等。無論在小菜塲，舊貨攤，水果攤或舊書攤上，我們都很容易見到這一類的活劇——爲了一個極微的數目爭了不少時間。他們的目光都斤斤較量地注視着那個數字，但忽視了珍貴的光陰。我也看到有些空手起家的老先生，他們都非常勤儉，他們寗可省下幾百元車費，而在炎陽之下晒上半小時。這種精神誠可令人欽佩，但實際上眞有些得不償失。如果他們能把那些走路的精力用在事業上，常然不僅只有幾百元的收穫的。</p>
<p>這使我憶起了從前聽到的一個關於時間的故事：</p>
<p>佛蘭克令在菲列台泉非亞設立了一爿小書店，一天，有一位吝嗇的顧客光臨到他的書店中。他想買一本書，但嫌職員開價太貴，所以要求見老闆。</p>
<p>職員回絕說：「佛蘭克令先生很忙碌，沒有功夫見你」。</p>
<p>但那位無聊的顧客盲目地在書架上翻了一個多鐘點，並堅持要見老闆，職員拗執不過他，只得去報吿佛蘭克令。</p>
<p>佛蘭克令先生怱怱地拋下了寫作和編排的工作，趕出見這個顧客。</p>
<p>「佛蘭克令先生，這本書最低得多少錢？」</p>
<p>佛蘭克令很簡捷地回答：「一又四分之一元」</p>
<p>「一又四分之一元，怎麽？你的職員只要我一元便够了。」</p>
<p>「是呀，」佛蘭克令回答說：「那麼你爲什麽叫我不能安心工作？」</p>
<p>那位有閒的顧客，不知佛　克令是在開玩笑還是算正經，所以又問：「請你吿訴我這本書究竟需多少錢？」</p>
<p>「現在　一元半。」</p>
<p>「怎麽？一元半—剛才不是說一又四之一元？」</p>
<p>「是呀，我想你還是趁現在討了一元半較好一些！」</p>
<p>那位吝嗇的顧客立即付了書價溜之大吉</p>
<p>這雖是一個故事，但牠給我們一個極有力的暗示：有許多人都忽視了時間的珍貴，同時更浪費了別人可貴的時間！</p>
<p>在寫字間中，我們可聽到不少無聊的話語，在學校中我們可見到很多誤人的消遣，在社會上更有無數消時的應酬。</p>
<p>他們都是時光老人的盜賊。</p>

<h3>市區禽獸太少　我們需要動物圍</h3>
<p>— 保羅</p>
<p>上海第一所市立動物園成立於廿二年八月一日，園址在南市文廟路，園地面積七畝三分。廿三年秋，値該園全盛時代·計有動物舍大小廿八所，獸類有虎·豹·獅·象·黑熊·駱駝·袋鼠·糜鹿等卅二種。禽類有孔雀·白鶴·鵜鶘·鴛鴦·鷺·雁·雉·鷹等四十四種。爬蟲類有　·蟒·龜·龞等四種。廿四年二月間，該園更向崇明漁戶購得四十除呎長的鯨魚一尾，頭寬丈許，齒銳似鋸，肉已挖空，祗餘皮骨，淨重也有五千餘斤。該園廿二年度（廿二年八月一日起至廿三年六月卅日止）門票收入達二萬零四百六十八元四角四分，參觀人數爲一百十五萬九千三百零六人。廿三年，而積擴充至十畝九分，該年度門票牧入爲一萬七千八百十八元一角六分，參觀人數計一百零五萬九千七百八十一人。以後每年參觀人數，常在百萬以上。該園歸上海市敎育局管轄，二十年十月開始籌備，費時兩年，方吿完成。「八一三」事變，該園除將一部份虎豹運往顧家宅公園寄放外，其餘盡被燬失。直到眼前，仍無恢復的消息。</p>
<p>老虎患TB</p>
<p>市民對於動物園，興趣非常濃厚，在廿四年十月，園內猛虎患肺病死，以及廿五年四月廿二日，園中巨象觸電暴斃，消息傳出，報章登載，整個社會，竟爲鬨動，成爲街頭巷尾，紛紛議論的資料。</p>
<p>除了上述的市立動物園以外，在當時的公共租界工部局管轄下的兆豐公園，也附設有動物園一所。工部局在民國三年，開始建築兆　公園，當時園地　督　克利在他的計劃書中，指明擬在園內闢設動物部，實際　至民國七年，園內始有鴛鴦，鴿，貓頭鷹、兎，山羊、鴟、猴等禽獸陳列。十年，工部局出　購得毗連園址北部空地二畝九分三厘九奄，闢作動物園，十一年，工竣開放，直到今日，依舊存在。</p>
<p>有敎育意義</p>
<p>動物園　於兒童數育很有裨益，世界各國的市政當局，多半舉辦動物園·以供市民觀覽。英，美，日，法等國國內所有的動物園，皆在三四十所以上。以東京上野公園的動物園和倫敦動物園而言·平均每年有三百數十萬人參觀。情况熱烈·可以想見。</p>
<p>上海是中國第一都市，人口三百四十餘萬，目前僅有動物園一所，是接收洋人的遺產得來的，而且滿目荒凉·破敗不堪·園址狹小，「動物」有限，每逢節慶例假，擁擠喧嘩，變成了人看人，遊覽觀賞根本談不上。在市政漸入軌道的今日，我們要向主政諸公呼喊：</p>
<p>我們需要一個標準的動物園</p>

<h3>一篇演說驚動了全球　美商務部長華萊士</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>中國人對於華萊士這個名字不該感覺陌生，因爲他過去曾以已故羅斯福總統私人代表的資格，到過重慶，昆明等地，並且和我國的黨政要人晤面詢談。</p>
<p>毫無諱言餘地，華萊士於本月十二日，在紐約市以商務部長的資格，發表美國外交政策演說，主張美蘇和睦相處，不受英外交政策牽制，這一篇演詞，震驚了世界。關於華氏的見解和演詞所引起的後果，不屬本文範圍，這裏祇將華萊士過去的出身，經歷，簡略介紹：</p>
<p>亨利·華萊士，一八八八年十月七日生於美國盧華州，埃地亞康台（Adair　County）城，當廿一歲時，他已在盧華州立大學畢業。</p>
<p>熱心農事</p>
<p>盧華州有一個農業刋物——「華萊士的農夫」（Wallace'sFarmel），是華萊士的祖父一手創立，因此他離開學校以後，便在一九一〇年加入該刋，充任職員。當時該刋的主編，就是他的父親。</p>
<p>一九二一年，華萊士的父親應哈定總統之召，赴華盛頓就任農業部長，刋物的輯務，交由華萊士主持。這時，他已經三十三歲，正値年輕有爲，他親任指導作成多種農業實騐，結果很圓滿，尤以某種玉蜀黍經過改良種植，收穫量有顯著的進步。</p>
<p>華萊士的祖父和父親都屬共和黨員，華萊士起先也加入爲共和黨員，後來，他因爲同情故羅斯福總統的施政，便在一九三二年聲明擁護羅氏而轉入民主黨爲黨員。</p>
<p>長農業部</p>
<p>一九三三年，故總統羅斯福倚慕其才，特任華萊士爲農業部長，他在任內主要的政績建樹，便是手訂「農業修正法案」，但是這法案在一九三五年被美國最高法院指爲違反憲法，華氏重加改訂，卒獲通過。</p>
<p>一九四〇年六月，他被推薦爲民主黨副總統候選人，同年十一月與羅斯福氏同時當選爲正副總統，</p>
<p>一九四四年再度參加　選，又落選·同年春季，奉命出任商務部長，直到今日。他是個很有趣的人物</p>

<h3>Minister Wang Discusses Foreign Policy, Clarifies the Position of Our Government, Establishes Commercial Treaties Based on the Principles of Equality and Mutual Benefit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Foreign Correspondents' Press Conference of the Central Propaganda Department was held as usual at 4:30 PM on the 18th in the reception room of the International Propaganda Office of the National Goods Building. Those present included Minister Peng Xuepei, Minister Wang Shijie, Director Liu Quechang, Chief Zeng Xubai, Central Propaganda Department Advisor Bell, and over forty Chinese and foreign journalists. First, Minister Peng gave a speech, introducing Foreign Minister Wang, who had just returned from Paris, to the reporters. Wang then stood up and briefly stated: "I feel very pleased to meet with all the reporters today, and I hope that my answers to your questions will be helpful to all of you." He then answered each of the questions raised by the reporters one by one. The main questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Question: (1) In future foreign relations, will China still adhere to the "open door" policy? Now that extraterritoriality has been abolished, does Your Excellency believe that the "open door" policy will also change accordingly? (2) In China's commercial negotiations with the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries, will the concept of "most favored nation" be generally applied? Will certain specific countries receive special rights?</p>
<p>Answer: I would like to answer these two questions together. The established policy of the Chinese government is to make every effort to utilize foreign capital and technology to develop China's resources and improve the living standards of the Chinese people. This is the guiding principle of our country's recent legislation on commercial company issues and related matters. The Chinese government intends to grant most-favored-nation treatment to all countries that conclude commercial treaties with us. The condition for enjoying this treatment is reciprocity. China does not intend to adopt any discriminatory treatment towards any foreign country in any part of its territory. If this attitude can be considered an "open door" policy, then the so-called "open door" is actually China's own policy. However, we must solemnly declare that, regarding such economic and commercial matters, China's international obligations must be limited to the conventions, treaties, or other agreements that China has participated in, just like other matters.</p>
<p>Question: Will the 21-nation peace conference in Paris become a blueprint for future peace conferences with Germany and Japan?</p>
<p>Answer: In terms of procedures and conference organization, I believe that the Paris Peace Conference will generally serve as a model for peace conferences with Germany and Japan. In terms of substantive issues, there will inevitably be some differences in the peace treaties with Germany and Japan. However, the basic attitude of the United Nations towards all peace treaties should be to seek a fair and lasting peace with a spirit of coordination.</p>
<p>We Should Obtain a Superior Proportion of Assets Designated as Reparations from Japan</p>
<p>Question: In the future peace treaties with Germany and Japan, will China advocate harsh or lenient terms?</p>
<p>Answer: China's attitude can be briefly described as follows: In military terms, such as preventing the resurgence of militarism, the peace treaty must establish very effective safeguards. In economic and political terms, if the terms of the peace treaty are too harsh, they will be exploited by reactionary forces in the defeated countries, making it difficult for democratic and peaceful forces to rise. We must avoid this situation. Under no circumstances should the peace treaty adopt a policy of revenge.</p>
<p>Question: What is the progress on the issue of Japanese reparations? What is China's goal in demanding reparations from Japan?</p>
<p>Answer: The preliminary discussions on the issue of Japanese reparations by the Reparations Committee have not yet been completed. Member states are currently consulting on the establishment of a specialized agency to handle this matter. As for China's demands, I would only like to state at this time that we have resisted the longest and suffered the greatest losses. We should obtain a superior proportion of assets within and outside Japan that can be designated as reparations. The Potsdam Declaration stipulated the general principles for the issue of Japanese reparations. China has accepted it. The total amount of Japanese reparations will be determined in accordance with this principle. China has no intention of keeping the Japanese economy in a state of perpetual bankruptcy and servitude. I believe that no other country in the United Nations has this intention either.</p>
<p>Use of the Lushun Naval Port Should Be Handled in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>Question: What is the current status of Dalian? What progress has the Chinese government made in taking over the Dalian municipal administration? Are Soviet troops still occupying Dalian? Have China and the Soviet Union agreed on a specific date for the withdrawal of Soviet troops?</p>
<p>Answer: The Chinese government has not yet taken over Dalian. There is no detailed information regarding this matter.</p>
<p>Question: The United States has requested to establish a consulate general in Harbin. Has the government discussed this with the Chinese Communist Party?</p>
<p>Answer: The Chinese government has expressed its agreement to the United States establishing a consulate general in Harbin.</p>
<p>Question: Regarding the joint use of Lushun as a naval port by China and the Soviet Union, will China firmly uphold its treaty rights?</p>
<p>Answer: China will naturally handle it in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance.</p>
<p>Question: According to the Central News Agency, the Chinese government has sent an official representative to Seoul to serve as a representative in the US military occupation zone in Korea. Under what title is this person serving? What is the status of Chinese people in the Soviet military occupation zone in Korea? Is the Chinese government currently discussing with Soviet representatives the dispatch of Chinese representatives to the Soviet military occupation zone in Korea?</p>
<p>Answer: The Chinese government will establish a consulate general in Seoul, within the American occupation zone of Korea. As for the area ruled by the Soviet Union, we plan to discuss this matter with the Soviet authorities in the near future.</p>
<p>Our Policy Toward Vietnam: We Wish to See Autonomy and Independence</p>
<p>Question: Will the new Sino-French Agreement concluded on February 28 of this year become a good foundation for Sino-French relations in the future?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Question: What is China's basic policy toward Vietnam? Since Chairman Chiang issued a statement last year advocating autonomy and independence for Vietnam, has the Chinese government's attitude changed?</p>
<p>Answer: Our attitude towards Vietnam has not changed. The Chinese people and government wish to see the people of all colonies realize their aspirations for autonomy and independence within a reasonable period of time. We are very pleased to hear that negotiations between the French government and the Viet Minh representatives have made progress.</p>
<p>Question: Is there hope for China and France to conclude a commercial treaty soon?</p>
<p>Answer: China will begin negotiations with the French government soon.</p>
<p>Question: What are Foreign Minister Wang's opinions on Foreign Minister Bidault's attitude at the peace conference?</p>
<p>Answer: At the conference, Mr. Bidault led the French delegation and made every effort to reduce the difficulties encountered by the conference. Mr. Bidault's abilities are admirable.</p>
<p>We Will Support Siam to Join the United Nations</p>
<p>Question: Does China support Siam's request to join the United Nations?</p>
<p>Answer: China is willing to support Siam's request to join the United Nations.</p>
<p>Question: Does China support the partition of Germany, or does it advocate preserving a federal or unified Germany?</p>
<p>Answer: The Atlantic Charter stipulates that all peoples should be free to choose the form of government they wish to support. We firmly believe that this principle should also apply to former enemy countries. Any solution that violates this principle will be detrimental to the establishment of lasting peace.</p>
<h3>Envoy Visits Foreign Minister Wang, Also Meets Canadian Ambassador</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Ambassador Stuart and Fu Jingbo visited Foreign Minister Wang and Canadian Ambassador Oudren at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:15 AM on the 18th for diplomatic courtesy calls, returning at 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Leaves Nanjing for Shanghai, Ambassador Stuart Hopes Communists Will Participate in the Five-Person Meeting, Resolving Disputes by Starting with Politics</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] A senior government official told reporters on the 18th that peace talks should come to a conclusion before the end of this month, because there is a "chance" within this period. Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart are making efforts to explore the intentions of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), but the CCP's attitude changes almost daily, and the difficulty lies perhaps in this.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Wu Tiecheng took the night train to Shanghai on the 18th, and it is said that he will have contact with representatives of various parties in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Special Envoy Marshall returned to Nanjing a day ago, and the deep expectations of all parties have been revealed. Ambassador Marshall stated that he still actively hopes that the Communist Party can attend the informal five-person group meeting, because when he went to Lushan eight times, the Communist Party suggested convening a military three-person meeting to first resolve the issue of a ceasefire. Ambassador Marshall discussed this idea with the Chairman, who believed that the informal group meeting was a way to seek a comprehensive ceasefire from a political perspective, and that other matters could be discussed after achieving success in the allocation of seats for members of the National Government Committee. Therefore, Ambassador Marshall informed Ambassador Stuart of this idea during their long talk last night. At 10:30 AM on the 18th, Ambassador Stuart met with Wang Bingnan, and in addition to conveying this intention, he also advised the Communist Party to participate in the five-person group meeting. Wang firmly stated that the Communist Party refused to participate in the talks and insisted on convening a military three-person meeting to discuss a ceasefire. At 5:30 PM, Fu Jingbo visited government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng to solicit their opinions, returning at 7:00 PM. Furthermore, according to the spokesperson of the Communist Party representatives tonight: "The current situation has reached its most serious stage." Ambassador Stuart stated that the talks are still hopeful and have not reached a final turning point.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] According to authoritative sources: "Generally, people observe the political situation and make inferences from a formal perspective, especially regarding the views on the three-person and five-person meetings. They believe that the current situation is serious, and the war is fierce, so it should start with an immediate ceasefire. In fact, if we broaden our perspective, the Chinese problem is definitely not military but political. Therefore, if we have an unconditional immediate ceasefire, and the political problems are not resolved after the order is issued, domestic disputes will still not be curbed. Therefore, we should focus on addressing the root cause and start from the political aspect." Someone also said: "If we formally discuss national affairs and convene a political consultation conference, then why would the war start again?" Someone also believed: "The Communist Party's refusal to participate in the informal five-person group meeting is like 'refusing to eat because of fear of choking.' If they can participate, there will definitely be achievements, and the goal of a ceasefire will definitely be achieved."</p>

In recent days, they have carried out extensive destruction, burning, killing, and looting in the suburbs. On the evening of the 15th, they bombed the Pingwang Power Plant, the auto repair shop outside the East Gate, the engine section water tower of the Yuhe Railway Bridge, and other major buildings.

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Hosts a Tea Party for the Press, Discusses the Experience of Attending the Peace Conference, Peace Treaties with Germany and Japan Can Be Signed Within the Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] After attending the Foreign Correspondents' Press Conference of the Central Propaganda Department at 5:00 PM on the 18th, Foreign Minister Wang hosted a tea party at the Foreign Minister's residence, inviting the persons in charge of various newspapers in Nanjing and representatives of various newspapers stationed in Nanjing, to report on the experience of attending the Paris Peace Conference. First, he said: "Although this conference was specifically for negotiating peace treaties with the five Axis satellite countries of Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland, in terms of procedures and organization, it was a model for the peace conferences with Germany and Japan, so we cannot but pay attention to it. The organization participating in this conference consisted of 21 countries. Although more countries than this number declared war on the five countries, according to the consultation of the five foreign ministers in December of last year, the number was limited to those who directly participated in the war, hence this limitation. Although we did not participate in the European theater of war, we were able to participate because it was decided by the foreign ministers' meeting and because we are a permanent member of the Security Council. In addition, countries such as Egypt, Iran, and Albania were also allowed to send representatives to attend the conference or make statements at the review committee because the relationships involved were more extensive."</p>
<p>Voting System and Language Consumed the Most Time</p>
<p>After the opening of the conference, the first issue to be resolved was the issue of the chairmanship. The small countries held objections to this point because they did not participate in the drafting of the peace treaty and did not agree with the method of the five countries taking turns as chairman. Some advocated that France, as the host country, should serve as chairman, while the Soviet Union believed that it was different from the United Nations Conference in San Francisco and advocated that the five countries should still take turns. The French side also stated that it would only be willing to allow France to be the host country if everyone unanimously agreed. In the end, it was decided that the five countries would take turns according to the alphabetical order of the names of the countries. Next, he described the order of the meeting, stating: "Regarding the voting at the conference, the foreign ministers' meeting had decided that a two-thirds majority was required for passage. The Soviet side also believed that this was the case when discussing the United Nations Charter, but the small countries felt panic and believed that the passage of the peace treaty would still have to go through the foreign ministers' meeting in the future, so they mostly advocated using a majority voting system. The dispute was quite intense. In the end, because all parties hoped that I would propose a compromise plan, I (Wang referring to himself) proposed that since it was not easy to resolve with a two-thirds majority, and adopting a majority system would often allow too many to abstain when the conference voted, it was advocated that eleven votes should be used as the voting number. The British side also suggested voting in two ways, one using a two-thirds vote and the other using eleven to fourteen votes. Both results were transferred to the foreign ministers' meeting for reference, which was the same in spirit as what I proposed. The meeting time was spent on this for two weeks. As for the languages used at the conference, they were English, French, and Russian. I stated that I reserved the right to add 川中文 (Sichuanese?) to the future peace conference with Japan, because the use of three languages also took up a lot of time during the conference."</p>
<p>Although There Were Many Disputes at the Peace Conference, the Results Were Optimistic</p>
<p>Next, he described the spirit of this peace conference, stating: "Although there were many disputes at the meeting, in view of the lessons learned after the last war and in order to prevent new wars, the results are still optimistic. For example, regarding compensation to Italy, in addition to the British colonies initially demanding compensation of 1.5 billion pounds, they later withdrew the demand. The Soviet side demanded 100 million US dollars, but Britain and the United States both stated that they would not seek compensation and did not want land. Countries such as South Africa and Greece suffered great losses, but they did not make excessive demands. During the Boxer Rebellion, Italy demanded compensation from China for 35 years, and the amount paid was 30 million US dollars. Although we did not directly fight against Italy this time, the indirect damage and impact caused by Italy were great. However, in order to support Italy to embark on the path of democracy, we also did not dwell on past grievances and did not make any demands." Next, he described the issue of Italian colonies, which the foreign ministers' meeting has not yet resolved, but in principle, a decision needs to be made urgently. For example, if we follow the previous League of Nations mandate system, it has failed because it did not set a time limit. In the future, if we follow the United Nations trusteeship system, we should also respect the principle of national self-determination at the same time, so that good results can be achieved in the future. This matter may have to be resolved by the foreign ministers' meeting or the United Nations conference in the future. Finally, he described the prediction of the results of the conference, stating: "Although the situation is constantly changing, it is predicted that the future peace treaties with Germany and Japan can be signed within this year. Although there are many difficulties, if we can recognize the principle of national self-determination and maintain the belief that peace will not be possible if Germany is divided, then everything will be easily resolved. After the signing of this peace treaty, the international atmosphere may change, and we may be able to expect to obtain new conclusions in the future."</p>
<h3>The Situation in Britain Has Changed Greatly in the Past Year</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] After reporting on the experience of attending the peace conference at the tea party, he talked about the situation in Britain, saying: "The situation in Britain has changed greatly in the past year. At this time last year, all parties in Britain, both in and out of the government, lacked confidence in politics and economics. After a year of austerity and hard work, confidence has greatly increased, and the atmosphere has been renewed. Last month, the British government announced that the number of exports had returned to the level of 1939. The Labor Party is in power and is confident that it can reach the path of democratic politics. The attitude towards India is also very different from the past, so the Indian people's feelings towards Britain have also changed greatly." Next, he answered reporters' questions: (1) Is the relationship between Britain and the United States fundamentally contradictory to that of the Soviet Union? Wang replied: "Ideologically, it is so, but I believe it can be overcome in the end." (2) Are we adding foreign tax officials to our customs again due to foreign pressure? Wang replied: "As far as I know, there is no foreign pressure, and this measure is not binding at all." (4) What do you think of Wallace's speech? He replied, "I have nothing to say about this at the moment."</p>

The drug trafficking organization has personnel in both Peiping and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Transport Plane Crashes and is Destroyed in the Sky Over Wangting, Suzhou</h3>
<p>American Correspondent Dies, Co-pilot Injured</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi Correspondence] The Aviation Corps of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China, in order to transport various current affairs newsreels produced by China to Taiwan, dispatched Lieutenant Chen Jianshuo of the Chinese Air Force on the afternoon of the 14th, accompanied by U.S. Air Force pilot Krakif and correspondent Weissmeier, in a C54 transport plane (number 2518) from Nanjing to Taiwan. The weather was poor when they took off from Nanjing, but because the aircraft was in good condition and Chen was experienced, they took off despite the bad weather. Unexpectedly, when flying over Zhenjiang, they discovered a mechanical malfunction, so they telegraphed the Nanjing Aviation Corps to report the situation. They planned to land at Changzhou Airport, but Weissmeier believed that the situation was not serious, so they decided to land in Shanghai. At that time, the fog was heavy and visibility was poor. Weissmeier suddenly opened the engine throttle, and air suddenly rushed in, causing a violent explosion in the fuel line. Weissmeier was injured on the spot, and the engine immediately stopped running. Chen notified them to prepare for an emergency landing, and slowly spiraled and glided down, intending to land on the Suzhou-Wuxi Highway. Unexpectedly, two cars were passing by. In order to ensure the safety of the dozens of passengers in the cars, he slightly tilted the fuselage. The tail first hit the foot of a small hill, and then the fuselage landed seven kilometers south of Wangting, Suzhou. The impact was extremely violent, and the aircraft was severely damaged. Chen, having taken appropriate measures, was not injured. Krakif injured his right arm. Weissmeier tragically died on the spot when his forehead violently struck the radio equipment, causing brain matter to spill out. His body was transported to Nanjing by Chen on the 15th. Krakif took a car to Shanghai for treatment and is temporarily staying at the International Hotel. The Nanjing Corps has dispatched a plane to Suzhou to dismantle the damaged plane and transport it to Nanjing. Fortunately, the films were not damaged. The day before yesterday afternoon, Chen took a Paratrooper jeep from Suzhou. On the way, the vehicle fell into a river due to a damaged bridge. Fortunately, the water was shallow, and nearby farmers helped to retrieve the vehicle. He arrived in the city in the evening, visited County Magistrate Xu at the county government, and then took a train to Shanghai, planning to fly to Nanjing to report, it is said.</p>

<h3>Autumn Rain and Bone-Chilling Wind; Shenyang Commemorates the September 18th Incident; Opening of the Joint Sports Meet, Ten Thousands Rejoice</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 18th] For the past fourteen years, the enemy and puppets have held grand celebrations for the September 18th Incident in the Northeast. Although last year marked the recovery, it was a time of war and chaos, and the people were both happy and apprehensive during the Soviet military occupation. Although this year is generally peaceful, there are many reflections on the future of the country. On the eve of the September 18th Incident, a heavy autumn rain suddenly changed the weather, and the wind was bone-chilling, so that it was almost impossible to resist the cold without wearing fur-lined cotton clothing. The first Liaoning Provincial Joint Sports Meet of All Circles was held today at the Jinshan Sports Field in Shenyang (formerly the International Sports Field), which is of great significance. Athletes showed their skills in the cloudy weather. The national flag was fluttering, and ten thousands cheered. People in the Northeast have not seen this scene for fourteen years. There was only a slight level of alert on the streets of Shenyang, and banquets and entertainment were prohibited. At noon, cannons were fired, and the entire city stopped activities to express condolences, with countless emotions.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 18th] Tianjin spent the "September 18th" day in silence. Yesterday, an autumn rain caused the temperature to drop sharply, and the mercury column fell to sixty degrees in the cold wind.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Far East Conference to Review the Transportation of Materials by the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The UNRRA Far East Conference was held yesterday at the Bank of China building on the fourth floor. Representatives from ten countries, including China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, India, and the Netherlands, attended. The Chinese representative, Jiang Tingfu, served as chairman. Yesterday afternoon, an closed-door group meeting was held at the original site. The Executive Yuan presented various detailed figures related to storage and transportation in the group. The conference will resume at 11:15 this afternoon, and it is expected that this conference can usually conclude today.</p>
<p>The main topics of the conference yesterday were: (1) A review of the transportation of relief materials by the Executive Yuan, (2) The repatriation of various groups of overseas Chinese who were displaced due to the war.</p>
<p>Regarding the transportation of relief materials by the Executive Yuan, US representative Kirkpatrick stated that 25% of UNRRA materials shipped to China were congested in the port of Shanghai. Kirkpatrick said that only 100,000 tons of materials have been transported inland in the past few months. UNRRA plans to allocate 1.5 million tons of materials to China, and if the transportation situation does not improve, it will take 15 months to transport these materials. The request to extend the period for relief in the Far East, as decided by the previous Far East Conference and submitted to the UNRRA General Assembly, has been rejected. All UNRRA work must be completely terminated by the end of June next year. Kirkpatrick asked Egerton, the head of the UNRRA office in China, to explain how to remedy the situation in such a short period.</p>
<p>Egerton immediately replied that under the current difficult circumstances, the work of clearing the port of Shanghai has indeed improved compared to before, and he firmly believes that transportation will be accelerated in the near future. It is unnecessary for UNRRA to reduce its assistance to China because of this.</p>
<p>Egerton then asked Handler, the UNRRA representative participating in the Port Clearing Committee of the Executive Yuan, to report on the port clearing situation. Handler said that the main reason for the slow clearance of warehouses is that some dilapidated and unusable heavy machinery is piled up in them, making transportation difficult. Most of these machines are war surplus materials, and the parts are incomplete and cannot be assembled. Note: Liu Hongsheng, the Executive Director of the Executive Yuan, once stated that he intended to sell these heavy machines at a low price so that the warehouses could be vacated, but there have been no buyers so far.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of repatriating refugees from various countries, the first proposal was to repatriate overseas Chinese refugees. Sabber, the director of the UNRRA Refugee Repatriation Bureau, said that the repatriation of overseas Chinese refugees will definitely begin by the end of this month, and some Philippine government officials who will arrive in Shanghai soon have promised to fully assist. Ms. Hingde, the British representative, said that the governments of Malaysia and Burma are also willing to conduct "trial voyages" for repatriating overseas Chinese. Sabber continued that 2,099 Austrian refugees residing in China have returned home, and the office has also received a telegram from the European military authorities allowing them to return home, but the German military authorities have not yet made such a statement. The US representative promised to convey their views to the relevant authorities. The Soviet representative Seminas proposed that the US and Soviet military authorities stationed in Korea send representatives to cooperate with UNRRA in handling the repatriation of Korean refugees, which was approved. It was also decided to review the situation of post-war relief in Korea at the next conference. The US representative mentioned the post-war relief in the Philippines, and because the Philippine representative was unable to attend yesterday, the conference decided to "urge" the Philippine representative to attend the next conference.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Agrees to Allocate Equipment to Repair the Hunan-Guangxi and Guizhou-Guangxi Roads</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 18th] The Guilin section of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway and the Liu (zhou)-Nan (dan) section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Road have not been repaired since they were destroyed by the enemy. The Guizhou Provincial Relief and Rescue Committee consulted with the Guizhou Relief and Rescue Sub-Bureau and requested the Executive Yuan to allocate equipment. The Executive Yuan has now approved the request. The committee has telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications, requesting them to immediately instruct the two roads to start repairs.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Hong Kong and Kowloon Should be Divided into Three Parts, a Veteran of the Diplomatic Community Tells Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In recent days, the calls for the recovery of Hong Kong have risen sharply again due to the establishment of administration in Kowloon City by our government, and some people in the Municipal Council have also proposed the demand to recover Hong Kong. This reporter specially visited a veteran of the diplomatic community in this city yesterday, and he shared his personal observations: The issue of Hong Kong and Kowloon should actually be divided into three parts: (1) Kowloon City has always been an important coastal defense area against Japanese pirates in our country. The city is strongly fortified and serves as an implicit strategic point for southern China. There was no explicit provision in the agreements with the British in the past to abandon the sovereignty of Kowloon City, so the establishment of administration by our country this time is not inappropriate. (2) The Kowloon leased territory was stipulated in the Treaty of Beijing in 1898, leased by the British for ninety-nine years. During the Anti-Japanese War, the British government, to show its respect for our country's heroic resistance against Japan, voluntarily returned the concessions in China. In this spirit, all unequal treaties between China and Britain in the past should be abolished; however, there was no precise provision for the handover of the Kowloon leased territory when the new treaty was signed at the time. According to the British interpretation, it seemed to be a tacit recognition of the British lease right over the Kowloon leased territory, and even regarded it as a de facto re-confirmation. However, if the British side truly has the sincerity to enhance British-Chinese friendship, then why not return this area to its original owner ten years earlier? (3) The status of Hong Kong is different from that of the Kowloon leased territory. Hong Kong is a British Crown Colony, directly under the jurisdiction of the British government. The people born in Hong Kong all have British nationality. The British government's foreign policy has always emphasized practical application, with a long-term vision. Sometimes, it is quite willing to make considerable concessions in disputes; however, giving up Hong Kong is equivalent to giving up the Far East. Judging from the current signs, Britain does not seem willing to do this. Recently, a Reuters reporter called the demand to recover Hong Kong a "storm in a teacup", which may be a considerable reflection of the attitude of the general British people towards this.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Forms Elected Government, British Chamber of Commerce Offers Opinions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th] The Hong Kong British Chamber of Commerce yesterday provided the government with opinions on the organization of the elected government. The powers of the elected government and the qualifications of voters recommended by the Chamber are more restrictive than those broadcast by the Governor of Hong Kong last month. According to the recommendations, foreign affairs, defense, ports, railways, post offices, customs, trade, control, shipping, taxation, financial audit, judicial officers, and police would still be the responsibility of the Royal Government. The elected government would only govern public works, education, health, taxation, and prisons. The elected government would have sixteen members, including six Chinese and ten non-Chinese. Members must have voter qualifications, jury qualifications, and must be recommended by two gentlemen. The voter qualifications stipulate that they must be British nationals who are at least twenty-five years old and must have the ability to pay one hundred yuan in property tax per month. The draft organization of the elected municipal government, broadcast at the end of last month, said that opinions must continue to be collected before a final decision is made. The Hong Kong British Chamber of Commerce is the general group of British businessmen, and its opinions may affect Hong Kong politics.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The original takeover inventory submitted by the Japanese side was handed over to the investigation team in the Jing City area by the Executive Yuan at noon on the 18th. According to the person in charge, any irregularities can be easily found based on this inventory.</p>
<h3>Hu Mai Sentenced to Ten Years in Prison for Unauthorized Withdrawal of Public Grain</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 18th] Hu Mai, the former director of the Hunan Provincial Field Grain Office, was accused of unauthorized withdrawal of public funds and speculation in grain. After the debate concluded, the Changsha District Court sentenced him today to ten years in prison and deprived him of his civil rights for ten years. Hu's case was originally punishable by death or life imprisonment. According to the presiding judge of the District Court, Hu (1) speculated in grain for the benefit of internal employees, (2) effectively regulated military and public grain in western Hunan during the war, and (3) ensured the supply of military grain during the Western Hunan Battle, so he was sentenced leniently.</p>

<h3>Changchun City Police Bureau Cracks Japanese Secret Organization; Large Scale Planned to Disrupt Our Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 18th] The Changchun City Police Bureau cracked the Japanese secret organization "Kokusuikai" in Changchun in June. This organization is quite large in scale and attempts to disrupt China's internal affairs in order to rebuild the Japanese Empire. The group's regulations state that "Oto-ko no Taiko (nephew of Marshal Yamamoto), who once served as the leader of the Jehol Expeditionary Force in Great East Asia, was a devil who killed anti-Japanese elements, and his wife, Kobayashi Haru, is quite capable and is one of his accomplices. The case was interrogated when the War Criminals Supervision Group came to Changchun and has been reported to the Military Command."</p>
<h3>Severe Drought and Extreme Heat in Fujian Province; Most of the Late Rice is Withered</h3>
<p>Rice Prices in Fuzhou and Xiamen Rise Continuously</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 17th] While the whole country is reporting a bumper harvest, Fujian is experiencing a severe drought due to extreme heat for more than two months from late summer to autumn. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, the indoor temperature here reached 97 degrees Fahrenheit. The extreme heat is even worse today, exceeding 110 degrees. Such extreme heat during the White Dew and Autumn Equinox seasons is unprecedented in decades. At present, the northeastern and western regions of Fujian are in the period of heading and grain filling for late rice, resulting in most of it withering. It is feared that this year's harvest will be less than half. As a result, rice prices in various places are rising daily. Today, white rice in Fuzhou sells for 83,000 yuan per stone, and 110,000 yuan in Xiamen.</p>
<h3>The Various Cannons Required for the Jiangyin Fortress are Being Shipped from Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Correspondence] In order to speed up the completion of the Huangshan and Xiaoshan forts, the Ministry of National Defense had Director Fu and Staff Officer Hua dispatched to Taiwan last month by Fortress Commander and Chengxi Joint Defense District Commander Kong Qinggui to receive new types of large and small cannons. The procedures have now been completed. Staff Officer Hua returned to Cheng on the 15th and reported to Commander Kong that the large and small cannons had been transferred from Tainan to Keelung. However, due to the lack of truck drivers for transporting the cannons and the fact that the freight exceeds the budget, it is necessary to consult with the Ministry of National Defense. Once the funds and more than forty drivers are settled, the cannons can be transported to Cheng for installation. At that time, if passing through the Xicheng Highway, because the bridges are only limited to a load of five tons, and the cannons weigh eight or nine tons, the bridges must be rebuilt before they can be transported. In addition, the Ministry of National Defense believes that there is a great need for talent in the fortress and recently sent important personnel to Cheng to discuss with Commander Kong the establishment of an artillery school and a fortress artillery training class in Jiangyin, which must be established within a short period of time. The training period will be six months.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Professor Pound's Farewell Advice</h3>
<p>Professor Pound, a world authority on law and advisor to our country's Ministry of Judicial Administration, returned to the United States yesterday. He will come to China again next June for a long-term engagement. During his three-month stay in China, Professor Pound conducted a preliminary and comprehensive study of our draft constitution and general legal system. His insights are truly worthy of national attention. Professor Pound is an American and is naturally very familiar with the American constitution and general legal system, having experienced them firsthand. However, as an authority on law, he can liberate himself from his subjective perspective and conduct objective research. Based on his observations and research over the past three months, he has provided us with many valuable opinions. Regarding the "May 5th Draft Constitution," he believes it is a satisfactory legal code. Of course, a constitution is a living thing; its value lies in its growth and development, not in quibbling over the wording of the articles. He said, "Every legal system has its historical and social background. The background of Western legal systems is different from that of China. Transplanting them to China may not be suitable in all cases, and the national conditions should be considered when making choices." These words are truly insightful and brilliant. Based on this viewpoint, he believes that the systems stipulated in the May 5th Draft Constitution are extremely compatible with our national conditions. Professor Pound strongly disagrees with the advocacy by some people in the country that China should adopt a cabinet bicameral system, and this is especially worthy of national consideration.</p>
<p>Regarding the draft constitution, it has been deliberated several times since the "Political Consultative Conference," yet some people still insist on adopting a cabinet bicameral system. This is truly a naive move, merely demonstrating their ignorance. The bicameral cabinet system originated in England, and the result of its evolution is only one power, as our Father of the Nation has long stated. The so-called bicameral system is, in fact, a mere formality. In France, the adoption of the bicameral cabinet system has kept France in political turmoil, never achieving political stability. This system itself is inherently flawed and should not be transplanted to China. Moreover, China has its own national conditions. Even good systems from other countries may not necessarily suit China's national conditions. Therefore, regarding China's political system, the system proposed in the May 5th Draft Constitution is truly the most ideal system, taking into account both foreign precedents and our national conditions. We should not underestimate ourselves and fail to cherish it. As he was about to depart, Professor Pound also specifically pointed out, "China has a wealth of talent. The Chinese people should have self-confidence and not simply imitate other countries." We should especially reflect on these words!</p>
<p>In addition, some people advocate that China should adopt the Anglo-American legal system, abolish the procuratorial system, and replace it with the Anglo-American national attorney system and jury system. Little do they know that this kind of argument is also unsuitable. Professor Pound said, "China has adopted the continental legal system for more than thirty years and should not make too many changes." This is not stubborn conservatism, but rather because a national system that has been in place for a long time should not be changed lightly and recklessly. On the basis of pursuing stability, we should establish China's legal system.</p>
<h3>The Struggle of Two Kinds of Democracy</h3>
<p>Nowadays, in the eyes of foreigners, it seems that there are two types of democracy prevailing in the world. Because their nature and systems are fundamentally different, they cause many misunderstandings and disputes everywhere. As a result, many diplomats and politicians can use the confusion of the meaning of the term as a tool for political struggle.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov publicly attacked British democracy as being democracy of the nineteenth century and Soviet democracy as being democracy of the twentieth century. This newspaper has already pointed out that his speech was astonishing. We are very happy to hear that the most powerful representative of the Soviet Union can clearly distinguish between the two types of "democracy" for the first time! We have recently read many British and American newspapers, most of which attack the Soviet Union as "undemocratic," while Soviet newspapers and broadcasts also attack Britain and the United States as "anti-democratic." We don't understand what they are arguing about.</p>
<p>The distant cause of British democracy is the rise of individual consciousness after the Renaissance, and the near cause is the transformation of philosophical thought since the seventeenth century and the industrial revolution of the eighteenth century. Due to the transformation and revolution of thought and industry, people in Europe urgently needed political freedom. Political freedom includes the most important matters of speech, publication, elections, and taxation. This is the essence of democracy in Britain, the United States, and many other countries in the world today. If a national government deprives the people of these freedoms, in the eyes of the British and Americans, the government of that country cannot be considered democratic. The opposite of democracy is autocracy. In the sense of oppressing the people's freedom, there is no fundamental difference between monarchical autocracy, aristocratic autocracy, and proletarian autocracy. Even if their autocratic motive is for the people, they are still autocratic. At most, they are just ancient "benevolent despotic monarchs."</p>
<p>Soviet democracy originated in the unrest of European socio-economics in the second half of the nineteenth century and the propaganda of Marxist theory. This kind of democracy is actually communism. Its nature is fundamentally different. What it wants to strive for is not political freedom but economic freedom. The system it wants to build is not a parliament in which all parties and factions represent the freedom of the entire people, but a soviet of the proletarian one-party dictatorship. Since it is called a dictatorship, how can it be called democracy? This is just the view of the British and Americans. The Soviet communists, however, believe that they are the most democratic because they are truly serving the people in economic terms.</p>
<p>If we understand these two types of democracy, which have the same name but very different meanings, many domestic and foreign political phenomena will be much clearer. For example, in a recent article by the famous American journalist John Fischer, "People Afraid in the Kremlin," he described many extremely undemocratic phenomena in the Soviet Union. All the power in the Soviet Union is in the hands of fourteen leaders, the political police closely monitor, the people are not allowed to talk to or associate with foreigners, and even when the 1,200 members of the Supreme Soviet meet, there is a political policeman with a gun watching every six steps. The only job of these representatives is to listen to the scheduled speeches and then unanimously express their approval! In terms of news, it is all government propaganda. A political authority told John Fischer that if the United States was truly democratic, it should completely eliminate many newspapers.</p>
<p>Completely eliminating opposing newspapers, forcing people to absolutely obey through terror policies, representatives only raising their hands, political police watching day and night, with the danger of life if they are slightly careless. This is Soviet-style democracy, which is also the democracy that Yan'an is learning, and the democracy that every communist in the world dreams of. Moreover, from the current standpoint of the Soviet government, unless all countries in the world become such democracies (such as Bulgaria, as mentioned by Foreign Minister Molotov), the Soviet Union itself will not feel safe.</p>
<p>What we find most strange is that, on the other hand, the Soviet Union and communists in various countries like to use the meaning of British-style democracy to attack the other side's lack of democracy for the sake of political struggle. This technique of struggle can indeed sometimes mobilize and stimulate some people who do not understand the truth, but it also often makes the Communist Party itself fall into unavoidable contradictions. Because what the Communist Party does itself is one thing, and what it attacks others with is another, so the faults that the Communist Party attacks others for are often the faults that they themselves are ten times worse than others!</p>
<p>But in all fairness, no matter how autocratic the Soviet Union is, there is one point that can still win the sympathy and yearning of most of humanity everywhere, that is, the Soviet Union's full attention to the people's livelihood. Human beings love freedom, but when they lack food and clothing, they can be forced to move to the other extreme, preferring to be oppressed by autocracy rather than watching others enjoy themselves while they starve to death. This abnormal phenomenon is not that the Soviet Union's one-party dictatorship is truly loved by mankind, but that under economic hardship, they cannot but choose the lesser of two evils. If the disciples who learn from the Soviet Union happen to learn the Soviet Union's dictatorship and forget the Soviet Union's attention to people's livelihood, instead forcing the people to be unable to survive and wandering everywhere, then they will be tens of millions of miles away from democracy.</p>
<p>If the best way for the United States to resist communism is for the government to work hard to improve the lives of the masses and prevent economic panic within fifteen years, then the best way for the Chinese central government to resist the Communist Party's secession and internal strife is also none other than to immediately accelerate the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Honestly speaking, even if the national government has not yet implemented constitutional government, it is more democratic than the communist "liberated areas" from Yan'an to northern Jiangsu, and it needs to pay more attention to the people's livelihood. If the Principle of People's Livelihood is not implemented and the people's lives have no way out, then autocracy and Soviet-style democracy will have the opportunity to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<h3>The CCP's Propaganda Tactics</h3>
<p>CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan stated to the press the day before yesterday that "if Marshal Ma cannot bring back the government's reply accepting the CCP's request to convene a three-person group meeting after returning to Nanjing from Guling, then there will be no reason to continue negotiations." The implication is that the CCP-KMT negotiations seem to have reached the final stage. Although this is a consistent tactic of the CCP's propaganda and psychological warfare, it is questionable whether the CCP-KMT negotiations, which are about to reach a dead end, can have a breakthrough. However, after Marshal Ma went to Guling and returned to Nanjing, it was reported that the CCP might participate in the five-person group meeting under certain conditions, and Marshal Ma is planning to go to Guling for the ninth time at the end of this week to make a final effort for domestic peace in China, so we do not need to be absolutely pessimistic about the overall situation of peace talks today.</p>
<p>Let us calmly observe where exactly the crux of the situation lies in the transition from stalemate to dormancy. After eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, China has learned its lesson from the pain. Who else wants to see the resurgence of war? Therefore, the desire for peace is the universal psychology of the people across the country, and even within the government, we must devote ourselves to the great cause of revitalizing and building the country in an atmosphere of peace. However, on the part of the CCP, while outwardly claiming to want peace, in reality, it is constantly deploying troops and generals to attack cities and seize land. Regardless of the recent results, whether or not they are beneficial to them, their original intention of expanding their territory at the expense of dismembering China has already been revealed. Since the CCP harbors such bad intentions, how can negotiations with the government yield results? The formation of today's situation is not only within our expectations, but also as the American media, such as The New York Times, said, "The CCP's plot for negotiations is only to gain a respite to revitalize its political struggle." However, the CCP has consistently refused to reflect on itself and instead wants to incite the people to oppose friendly nations that are well-intentioned in assisting our unification and revival, attempting to scare them away. Although this trick has failed, the CCP has not given up on this attempt. Wang Bingnan's remarks are still demanding: (1) the withdrawal of all American troops stationed in China, (2) the cessation of aid to the national government, and (3) the freezing of all surplus materials. According to yesterday's Nanjing telegram from the Associated Press, the capital is rumored to be considering temporarily freezing surplus materials. We suspect that this statement is another flanking propaganda war tactic by the Communist Party. In short, the Communist Party's premeditated intention is to use various methods to isolate the national government, so that the national government has no friendly nations abroad and no friendly parties at home, and then the Communist Party can do whatever it wants.</p>

<h3>US Secretary of the Navy Supports Byrnes; Truman Meets Wallace; Any Speeches on Foreign Policy Must Be Submitted to the State Department for Review</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 18th - Broadcasting from Washington: The White House announced this morning that President Truman will meet with Secretary of Commerce Wallace at 8:00 PM today. Authorities believe that Truman's action is proof of resistance to pressure from the State Department and the Army and Navy to demand Wallace's resignation.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 18th - Broadcasting: Wallace is scheduled to meet with President Truman at 3:30 PM today (2:30 AM on the 19th Shanghai time). According to Associated Press correspondent Wilson's prediction, Wallace has only two paths to follow in the future: one is to remain silent from now on, and the other is to withdraw from the cabinet, because the current cabinet crisis has reached the point of a showdown. Otherwise, Byrnes will inevitably resign.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 18th - Broadcasting from Washington: Some sources here believe that President Truman himself will not insist on Wallace's resignation and will probably ask him to stay in his original position. Truman currently has only two paths to follow: (1) ask Wallace to step down, but this move will lead to Truman's failure in the 1948 election; (2) unconditionally accept Wallace's policy and lead the State Department in this political direction, but this is practically impossible because all parties are exerting pressure. According to what Wallace told a representative of Agence France-Presse this morning, Truman will not ask Wallace to resign.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 17th] According to the White House announcement, Wallace is scheduled to meet with President Truman on Wednesday. This is the first time Wallace and Truman will meet after Wallace made a surprising speech in New York. People generally attach great importance to its development. Some diplomats believe that since Wallace's speech has caused such a major backlash, Truman may privately advise Wallace not to talk about foreign policy in order to avoid infighting within the party and to take into account international relations.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 18th - Broadcasting from London: According to "The Standard" foreign affairs commentator Barryman, President Truman may be summoning Byrnes to return to Washington this weekend for discussions.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 18th - Broadcasting: Byrnes met with British representative Alexander for an hour today. The US delegation issued a statement saying that Byrnes has not communicated with Truman since the Wallace speech incident. It is known that Byrnes did not express any criticism of Wallace's speech. Diplomatic circles are waiting with concern for the results of Truman's meeting with Wallace today.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Paris, 18th - Broadcasting from New York: US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal severely criticized Wallace's speech in front of more than a thousand American industrialists and senior naval officials, and praised Byrnes, praising him as a "great American who is dedicated to his country."</p>
<p>[Reuters New York 18th] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal was originally scheduled to deliver a speech at the annual dinner of the Navy Association. The speech稿 had been distributed to the press in advance, but the original plan was suddenly canceled. Forrestal said, "My intentions have changed, and I have decided that it is better to remain silent." Afterwards, a Navy Department spokesman said, "This is entirely Forrestal's own intention, and neither the State Department nor the White House has exerted pressure." Forrestal's explanation further stated, "When returning from Washington, I was at an altitude of 10,000 feet. Thinking deeply about the several atomic storms that have occurred in this city in the past few days, I feel that mentioning any part of the world will definitely have repercussions."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington 17th] Acting US Secretary of State Clayton recently met with newspaper reporters, and someone asked, "From where can one learn about American foreign policy?" The acting Secretary of State immediately replied, "President Truman's statements and Secretary of State Byrnes' speeches in Germany are sufficient to indicate American foreign policy. I believe that in the future, all speeches by ministers of various departments that involve foreign policy must be approved by the State Department in advance. This measure does not mean that ministers cannot enjoy freedom of speech, nor does it mean that they may not express any opinions, but it is intended to allow the government to indicate the extent to which it agrees with their opinions."</p>
<h3>Wallace's Letter to the President Published: Advocates a Policy of Appeasement Towards the Soviet Union; A Treaty Should Be Established for Joint Control of Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 17th] Secretary of Commerce Wallace sent a letter to President Truman on August 23rd, totaling twelve pages, advocating abandoning the atomic energy control plan of US representative Baruch and Deputy Secretary of State Acheson in the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, completely changing American military and foreign policy, and agreeing to the Soviet Union taking reasonable defensive measures to avoid causing a third world war. This letter was publicly released today. It formally declared for the first time that President Truman had invited Stalin to the United States. From this perspective, the content of Wallace's recent speech on American foreign policy in New York had probably already been told to President Truman. In the letter, Wallace made a broad critique of the policies adopted by the State Department, and specifically criticized the following two items: (1) The State Department insisted that if the Soviet Union wanted to obtain loans from the United States, it should first conduct trade negotiations with other countries. (2) International co-management of the Danube River and opposition to defensive engineering projects in the Dardanelles Strait. It is said that if the Soviet Union made a suggestion to internationally co-manage the Suez or Panama Canals and not allow fortifications, we would also feel panic and anger, and the Soviet Union's situation seems to be exactly the same. Wallace probably believes that the United States, because it has atomic bombs, heavy bombers, and unscattered military bases, currently has more power to bargain with others than any other country. It is said that the efforts made by the Soviet Union at this moment are only "slightly improved" compared to the United States.</p>
<p>Eliminating Soviet Fears: Security Can Be Guaranteed</p>
<p>Wallace warned that American decision-makers must know that their current attitude can only lead to two possibilities: (1) a war with the Soviet Union is inevitable; (2) all of humanity will be destroyed in this war. From this perspective, we must take the path of peace. The basic key to improving US-Soviet relations should be to reduce the various reefs that cause the Soviet Union to have fear, doubt, and distrust. We should recognize from a new standpoint what measures the Soviet Union considers necessary to maintain its own security and world peace, and cooperate with it to jointly establish a world order. We should be prepared to express agreement to the Soviet Union's reasonable security guarantees, even if we are seen as "appeasing the Soviet Union." We should not pursue the veto issue of atomic energy control, because this issue is irrelevant and should not be raised at all. We should be prepared to enter into a treaty to allow all countries to jointly control and develop atomic energy. I believe this is a major issue, and judging from the current trend, this issue may be broken and there is no hope of establishing an agreement.</p>
<p>Abandoning Power Politics: Seeking Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>The United States should not make statements at international conferences as if it has been invaded by foreign countries, because the only country that was not destroyed during the war and whose military strength is stronger after the war than before the war is the United States. The United States should cooperate more closely with the Soviet Union in economics and commerce. The issue of the Soviet Union borrowing money from the United States should be viewed from the "economic and commercial standpoint" and should not be mixed with power politics. In addition, trade negotiations should be conducted with the Soviet Union immediately. However, due to the difference between US and Soviet cultures, and the Soviet Union clearly insists on the "exchange" principle in any agreement, it is not easy to reach an agreement with it, but it is not impossible. My suggestion is to change a part of our concept of international issues. We must change our policies immediately.</p>
<h3>The Letter's Publication Went Through Twists and Turns</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 17th] President Truman stopped the publication of Secretary of Commerce Wallace's letter to the president on August 23rd at the last minute. It is said that this letter was written because the president ordered cabinet members to express their opinions on foreign policy. According to the Department of Commerce, the letter was "stolen" from the archives and fell into the hands of a feature writer. Wallace immediately discussed the matter with White House Press Secretary Ross and decided that since the letter had been leaked, it would be better to publish it. Ross told Wallace that he agreed and printed copies for distribution to various newspapers. Ross then spoke to the president and learned that the president did not approve of the publication of this letter, so as not to mislead foreign parties into believing that the president agreed with the contents of this letter. However, the distribution to various newspapers had already begun and could not be recovered. Ross admitted his fault and had nothing to do with Wallace. As for who the feature writer was, the Department of Commerce did not mention his name. However, according to feature writer Pearson, "Unless Wallace's statement points out that the letter that I stole from the Department of Commerce was a Russian letter to President Truman, I will have to sue him for defamation." Pearson also said that he obtained this document "from another source, which has nothing to do with the Department of Commerce, and can be done openly and honestly."</p>
<h3>Differences Between the US and the Soviet Union Should Be Adjusted: Remarks by a US Army Officer</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 17th, Associated Press] Army Department officials said today that although the hope for long-term peace between the United States and the Soviet Union may not be realized as desired, the general fear of an imminent conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union has not been substantiated in the world situation. Responsible officials of the Army Department believe that the speculation that there will be a war in the next five years lacks evidence. The General Staff believes that the widespread fear of war throughout the world is largely due to an unreasonable worry caused by the diplomatic friction that occurred during the creation of peace between the United States and the Soviet Union. The official emphasized that the Soviet Union suffered heavy losses in the Second World War, and historical facts prove that there must be a period of construction and recuperation between the two wars. He also pointed out that the United States and the Soviet Union should adjust their differences before resorting to sanctions.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Warfare Spreads in Greece; The Government Decides to Conduct a National Sweep; Communist Leaders Arrested and Awaiting Trial on Charges of Incitement</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Athens 17th] It is announced here that the Greek cabinet has decided to begin a nationwide sweeping war in the near future. The commanders of the Second and Third Army Corps will order their troops to mobilize, and martial law will be implemented throughout the sweeping area. However, if the cabinet decides to ban the Communist Party, it is not yet the time to do so, so no measures have been taken on this.</p>
<p>[United Press Athens 17th] The war between the Greek army and gendarmes and the guerrillas is becoming increasingly tense throughout the country today. The main battlefield has recently shifted from Macedonia. Two months ago, the governor of the province said that a guerrilla war was taking place on the Thessaly Plain, through which the main traffic artery from Athens to Thessaloniki passes. Rioters planted landmines on highways, destroyed traffic, cut telephone lines, and attacked troops and police.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Athens 17th] Greek Communist leader Zachariadis will be tried in Thessaloniki tomorrow on charges of inciting the people and mutual hatred. The Communist Party headquarters in Athens was searched yesterday, and six people were arrested. The party recently protested against this. Seven Communist leaders in Tripoli and the Peloponnese have also been exiled.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Yugoslavia 17th] Tirana, Albania: On the 13th of this month, five Greek soldiers disguised as women penetrated Albanian territory and then withdrew, apparently continuing to shoot. This proves that Greek fascists are doing everything possible to cause trouble on the Albanian border.</p>
<h3>Egypt Revises Criminal Law: Bans Communist Propaganda</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Cairo 18th] The King of Egypt has recently issued an order approving the addition of revised clauses to the criminal law to prevent the spread of communist propaganda in Egypt.</p>
<h3>Security Council Meeting: Soviet Representative Serves as Chairman</h3>
<p>[US New Opening Office Success Lake 17th] The United Nations Security Council met today, and Soviet representative Gromyko served as chairman. Continuing to discuss the Ukrainian case against Greece, Gromyko proposed a proposal to stop border incidents between Greece and Albania.</p>
<h3>Discussions in the Senate on the Issue of Reporting Traitors; Tenth Group Completes Review Work; Shen Guanya Attends to Report on the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries; Expresses Readiness to Endure Another Scolding</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The City Senate held its thirteenth meeting yesterday morning, where the Bureau for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries reported on its work, and senators raised intense questions. In the afternoon, proposals were discussed in groups. Except for the first, second, fourth, and third groups, which had already completed their review, the remaining seven groups also completed their respective reviews, bringing everything to a conclusion. The most heated discussions yesterday were in the third and ninth groups. The former reviewed the mayor's motion to increase taxes and the horse racing issue, while the latter thoroughly reviewed the city government's new half-year budget.</p>
<p>Today's agenda includes the fifteenth meeting in the morning to continue discussing Civil Affairs Proposal No. 15 regarding the reporting of traitors, as well as discussing financial proposals. The sixteenth meeting in the afternoon will discuss industrial, commercial, and economic proposals.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Enemy and Puppet Industries Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region sent its Secretary-General, Shen Guanya, to attend and report. Mr. Shen said: "Reporting to the Senate is a bitter task because one is subjected to questioning, and questioning is just another form of scolding. I am not afraid of being scolded, so I have come today to attend and report as ordered." Finally, Mr. Shen added: "Although I dare not say that the handling of enemy and puppet industries is unprecedented, it is indeed unparalleled. Since the Qing Dynasty, we have always been defeated, and only others have taken our property. At the beginning of the victory, the Bureau was established hastily, making do with whatever we had. Today, I dare not say that we have achieved success. What should have been done has been done, but there are some areas where I am not satisfied."</p>
<p>Regarding the Bureau's work since October, Mr. Shen reported in categories. It was stated that the Review Committee holds meetings three times a week, and has held over 130 meetings to date, formulating nearly 100 types of regulations and passing over 1,500 motions.</p>
<p>Regarding the receiving and handling of industrial materials: 1,156 wharves and warehouses were handed over by the Jianghai Customs. The Ministry of Economic Affairs received 480 factories in Shanghai. The issue of factory resumption has garnered significant attention from the public, but resumption requires machinery, equipment, and money. Given the Ministry of Economic Affairs' financial difficulties, it has made its best effort to resume factory production. Real estate and furniture are entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau for receipt in accordance with regulations. All enemy and puppet real estate is ordered to be sold. German properties, including the German Fufa Foreign Firm, Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Siemens, etc., are also being dealt with. The work of investigation and seizure is also the most criticized. Approximately 2,500 cases have been handled, and over 30 billion in materials have been seized. The Investigation and Seizure Group ended its work at the end of June and has already issued over 300 million yuan in whistleblower rewards.</p>
<p>Regarding the sale of assets, in accordance with the decree of the Executive Yuan, enemy and puppet industrial materials, except for a portion transferred to relevant agencies, must generally be auctioned and sold for cash. There are three methods of sale: 1) sale at fixed prices or allocation, 2) consignment and price concession, and 3) bidding and auction. The receipts from the handling of enemy and puppet industries up to August 31st total 331,851,282,560.91 national currency, and it is hoped that the total will reach 500 billion by the end of the year. This sum will help balance the amount issued in the Shanghai region, it is said.</p>
<p>A Chorus of Accusations; Endless to the Ears</p>
<p>After Shen Guanya finished his report, oral questions began. The first to take the stage was Zhu Wenqi, who inquired about the handling of yarn and cloth that had been forcibly purchased during the enemy and puppet period. Yarn and cloth merchants who had been requisitioned had requested the Bureau to return them, and this was initially approved, with six merchants even receiving their yarn and cloth. However, the return was suddenly halted. Mr. Zhu asked what attitude the Bureau was taking, and whether it would return the goods or not.</p>
<p>The Bureau has, on the one hand, allocated some factories to manufacturers from the rear, while, on the other hand, promised the original owners of those factories priority purchasing rights. How can you give one daughter to two families?</p>
<p>The Bureau no longer inquires about factories directly taken over by American businesses, but factories belonging to Chinese citizens must go through various handling processes. Why is there a difference in treatment between Chinese and foreigners? All of the Bureau's work is too slow. It can be described with three characters: "cow-like pace." (2) Huang Bingquan inquired about the enemy's purchase of over 400,000 pieces of yarn and cloth, 16 million bolts. How has this been resolved, and to what extent? (3) Chen Baotai inquired: "I do not know this gentleman's honorable name. Please introduce yourself. The Bureau is a temporary postwar agency, and also an agency that exploits the people. The Senate is created by the people and must speak for the people. We demand that the central government abolish the Bureau and have it handled by the municipal government."</p>
<p>(4) Jin Runxiang inquired about cases of forcibly occupied civilian houses. In most cases, the houses have been returned to their original owners in writing only, but they have not actually received them. This is because of "officials protecting each other," and they are unwilling to effectively protect the common people. He cited the example of the Ning Shao Merchant Shipping Company's warehouse, which was occupied by eight armed units, as well as houses occupied by the Ministry of Education and the Police Bureau. He asked if the Bureau's return of occupied houses involves such situations, and whether the Bureau has the authority to order the forcible occupiers to move out. (5) Fei Shusheng inquired: "The Bureau is a labor-intensive and wasteful agency, and the people of Shanghai have suffered greatly. Since the Bureau is a temporary agency, it should clearly receive, clearly handle, and quickly end its work. When will it end? Do the Bureau's staff engage in dereliction of duty when investigating and secretly reporting enemy and puppet property? On the basis of a secret report alone, materials are seized. When requesting a return, the original invoice is demanded? Does Director Liu have original invoices for everything in his home?" (6) Jia Dechao inquired: "The Bureau has sealed off a large number of materials, but some of them are not enemy and puppet property. We have provided ample evidence and requested their return, but you have delayed and ignored us. When they are finally returned, they are empty. Why? To auction off materials, one must go through channels, and they can be obtained at extremely low prices. These so-called channels include dinners, gifts, cash, and gold. Is this true? There is still a large amount of enemy and puppet property in the suburbs that has not been sealed off. Why?" (7) Lu Huimin inquired: "Why do Bureau personnel arbitrarily load and transport sealed enemy and puppet materials?" (8) Wu Zhengjue reported a fact: a certain important factory, founded in 1924 or 1925, had an important invention. The enemy pressured a major shareholder of the factory to sell out, but the shareholder understood the greater good and was not tempted. Eventually, the enemy used coercion and faked a receipt, and the amount taken was less than 4% of the factory's value. After the victory, the factory's shareholders applied to various relevant agencies. After the Bureau sent personnel to investigate, it was decided that the factory's shareholders should have priority in purchasing it. Now it is worth billions of yuan. How can they afford it? They can only sigh at the factory. Did the Bureau thoroughly review the circumstances of the coercion? The factory's shareholders originally intended to appeal to higher authorities, but the Bureau responded: 'Very well, we will confiscate it.' Why?" (9) Gu Jinzao said: "I am not questioning, but providing some facts, which should be given special attention. Currently, the number of people evading asset seizures through various guises is staggering. The Ministry of National Defense is currently retaining some Japanese people, who are concealing large amounts of materials through various forms. They are using Taiwanese, government officials, and generals above the rank of lieutenant general to form companies, using the evaded materials as capital. I hope the Bureau pays attention." (10) Zhu Wende inquired: "Why are people's original documents submitted to the Bureau repeatedly lost? When we ask Bureau personnel, 'What happens if they are lost?', they reply, 'Think of another way.' As for what that way is, it is unspoken." (11) Hou Jiyuan said: "I am not questioning, just asking. Kong Xiangxi's property in Hongkou was auctioned off as enemy property. Currently, Mr. Kong is demanding its return, but the buyer is unwilling, leading to disputes. It has reached the auction stage, but the Bureau has not yet clarified the property rights. What is the reason for this?"</p>
<p>Request for an Appropriation of 900 Million to Conduct Relief Work</p>
<p>The Seventh Review Committee held its fourth meeting and preliminarily resolved all proposals related to social relief and labor. It was decided to merge the social relief and women's relief proposals. This was because, when Chairman Chiang visited Shanghai this spring, the Social Affairs Bureau requested that he allocate 900 million yuan for relief work. The Chairman verbally agreed to contact the Executive Yuan. Later, the Executive Yuan instructed them to apply to the "Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA)." The RRA then instructed them to collect funds from the Shanghai branch, but the Shanghai branch did not have these funds, so the relief funds have not been received to this day. Recently, women's groups petitioned the City Senate to request that the city government allocate funds to conduct women's relief work, also totaling 900 million yuan, and asked for it to be included in the city government's budget. After yesterday's review, it was decided to request 900 million yuan to jointly conduct relief work and submit it to the general assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>Theater Petition</p>
<p>The group also received a six-point petition from the Theater Industry Association: (1) Please reduce the entertainment tax rate; (2) Please prohibit military personnel from causing trouble by watching plays without tickets; (3) Adjust labor-management relations; (4) Please simplify tax payment procedures; (5) Please extend business hours; (6) It is hoped that the authorities can find a way to provide loans for relief. In addition, Wing On Company needs to take back the site of the Tianyunlou Theater for their own use, and the company petitioned the association. These will be reviewed by the Review Committee and then submitted to the general assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding Public Works and Utilities</p>
<p>The Fifth Group reviewed proposals related to public works and utilities, and yesterday afternoon completed the review of all twenty merged proposals. Regarding the city ferry proposal, Senator Zhong Yuliang explained that the two small steamboats that used to travel between Pudong and Puxi were run by the local government. After the establishment of the National Government, they were taken over by the government. Pudong residents spend a lot of money on the ferry, but the facilities in Pudong are currently simple, and the government should pay more attention to construction. After review, it was decided to request that the city government allocate 1% of the city ferry revenue for the purpose of local projects in Pudong.</p>
<p>The group's discussion on banning rickshaws and pedicabs was also very heated. It was decided to request that the Public Works Bureau set up more public buses, which would naturally eliminate rickshaws and pedicabs. Otherwise, abolishing transportation tools would be even more difficult.</p>
<p>Only Understood Intuitively, Not Expressed in Words; Shen Guanya Responds to Questions</p>
<p>After the questioning came to a close, there was a ten-minute break, after which Shen Guanya gave a concise response. (1) The Executive Yuan will definitely make a decision on the yarn and cloth case in the future. As for the yarn and cloth that has been returned, as far as I can recall, it was to five merchants. This is because the Bureau's Third Group and Legal Advisory Committee initially believed that it should be returned, but the Review Committee decided to overturn the previous decision, so it was canceled. As for the American factory, because the name of the factory was not mentioned, I cannot answer. If the name of the factory can be mentioned, I can respond in writing. Regarding the slow handling of procedures, it is because Shanghai was occupied for eight years, and each case must be thoroughly investigated. If we do not investigate, we will be scolded, so we cannot help but be slow. (2) See previous answer. (3) It is inappropriate to say that the Bureau is an agency that exploits the people. Fortunately, the Investigation Team is here, so it does not matter if you report us. It would be good for the Bureau to be taken over by the municipal government, so that authority can be unified, but this must be decided by the Executive Yuan. (4) Regarding forcible occupation, in the current situation, there is no way to deal with it, and it is inconvenient to say more. Saying more would imply an attack on a certain party. Eighty to ninety percent of the houses received by the Bureau have been occupied. The Bureau can only handle the matter, but has no ability to compel military organs. This point can only be understood intuitively and not expressed in words. Please, Senators, think of a way, and the Bureau will definitely comply.</p>
<p>At this time, Senator Lu Yinchu stood up and said: "Since it can only be understood intuitively and not expressed in words, the Bureau does not need to answer at all." Shen Guanya consulted the chairman, Pan Xinchang, who said that he could change to a written reply.</p>
<p>Deadline for Reporting Traitors Arouses Fierce Debate; General Assembly Continues Discussing Proposals Yesterday</p>
<p>After the question and answer session ended, the discussion continued on Proposals No. 11 to No. 15 of the Civil Affairs category. The discussion of Proposal No. 15, "It is proposed to request the Central Government to set a deadline for thoroughly reporting and eliminating traitors, impose penalties according to law, and publicly and expeditiously try and sentence those traitors who have already been reported or are already in custody, in order to uphold national law and appease popular anger," was the most intense, with the most enthusiastic speeches. Chairman Pan even returned to the senators' seats and asked Vice-Chairman Xu to serve as chairman to explain the case. Chairman Pan said: "This case is of great significance. I have previously consulted lawyers, the Minister of Judicial Administration, prosecutors of the court, and other parties for their opinions. We know that political traitors in Shanghai can be seen at a glance, but how can businessmen in Shanghai not have any relationship with the Japanese in order to do business? Farmers grow grain and cotton, and if the Japanese want it, how can they not sell it to them? Our Shanghai City Senate represents the citizens of Shanghai and cannot disturb the citizens because of this issue. Therefore, there cannot be a time limit for reporting political traitors. There should be a time limit for reporting non-political traitors. We must pay special attention to the fact that setting a time limit for reporting traitors is not a relaxation, but only to urge and intensify the work of reporting traitors, so that everyone can quickly report, and after the deadline, they can no longer report. In short, this case should be discussed carefully."</p>
<p>Before Chairman Pan spoke, Senators Wu Zhengjue, Wang Xianqing, Jiang Huaishu, and Qu Yue all made statements. The main point was that if there is no time limit for reporting traitors, unscrupulous people will often use it to blackmail, causing the people to be uneasy day and night. Qu Yue also believed that the regulations on punishing traitors needed to be revised.</p>
<p>Feng Youzhen agreed with Chairman Pan's opinion and emphasized that the reason for setting a deadline for reporting traitors is that, first, it can intensify the punishment of traitors, and second, it can prevent blackmail and avoid affecting people's lives. Feng disagreed with the first item in the review opinion, "It is proposed to request the Central Government to explicitly stipulate laws and set a deadline for reporting traitors is inappropriate, because it may be difficult to do. It is recommended to change it to 'It is proposed to request the Central Government to explicitly order a deadline for reporting traitors.'"</p>
<p>Jia Dechao suddenly stood up to express his opposition, saying that traitors should never be allowed to raise their heads, so there should be no time limit for reporting. Some also believed that if a time limit is set for reporting traitors, some traitors who are at large abroad will be able to return to the country swaggeringly after the deadline. However, it was replied that no matter where the traitors are now, they can be reported, and the government will issue arrest warrants. They will definitely not be able to escape the law.</p>
<p>Because it was time to adjourn the meeting, and because the case was of great importance, a majority of senators passed a motion to move it to this morning for continued discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding this case, Zhan Wenhu told reporters: "It seems that a proposal should be proposed and passed at the same time as passing this case, that is, the current Senate should officially represent the citizens in making a general report on traitors from all walks of life in Shanghai. If this can be done, then those who support a time limit can take action to express their determination to report traitors, and those who oppose a time limit can use drastic measures to catch all kinds of large and small traitors in the city in one fell swoop to satisfy the people. Moreover, various materials are readily available and it seems that the Bureau for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries can be asked to assist, because each industry has a property owner, and the Bureau must first ascertain who the property owner is when handling enemy and puppet industries. This property owner is either an enemy or a puppet, making them the best foundation for reporting."</p>
<p>Heads of City Government Agencies Should Always Understand the People's Conditions</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Proposal No. 11 proposes that "the mayor and the heads of various agencies under the city government should inspect various suburbs at any time, so as to understand the people's conditions and urge local administration." It was resolved to pass it.</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Proposal No. 12, "Please instruct residents to ensure that children under the age of 14 must wear simple identification tags in case of emergency," was out of concern for children getting lost. Most senators believed that it was not necessary, "It's better to have one less thing!" So it was resolved to withdraw it.</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Proposal No. 13, "In order to propose consulting the municipal government to publish standards for compiling the cost of living index, and how to calculate and compile it," the general assembly resolved to change this case to a written inquiry, asking the municipal government for a written reply.</p>
<p>Housing Lease Management Revised Rules Draft</p>
<p>The Tenth Subcommittee's review of single-line regulations reviewed the "Revised Shanghai Housing Lease Management Rules Draft" throughout the entire afternoon yesterday. The review committee members were mostly legal professionals who deleted, revised, and amended the draft article by article, citing classic texts and historical precedents.</p>
<p>The draft stipulates that all housing disputes should first be "mediated" by the district office. If "mediation" fails, the Housing Lease Management Committee will "mediate." If "mediation" fails, a "ruling" will be made. If the parties do not comply with the "ruling," the public security organs will "enforce" it.</p>
<p>In addition to collecting rent and security deposits, landlords must not collect premium fees and small rents under any name. The security deposit must not exceed the total amount of two months' rent, and the rent must be calculated in national currency. The standard will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Landlords must not arbitrarily terminate the lease. If they refuse to accept the rent without justification, the tenant may submit it to the committee for approval and deposit the monthly rent with the Shanghai City Bank.</p>
<p>Police Affairs Review Completed</p>
<p>The Second Review Committee completed the review of the policy reports and proposals on police affairs at the last subcommittee meeting, and the review opinions have been sent to the General Assembly Secretariat. It was originally planned to re-read and revise this review result once again yesterday afternoon in order to be careful and thorough, but because the original manuscript had been delivered to the Secretariat for printing, it could not be realized. The review committee members chatted for a while at the meeting place and then left.</p>
<p>No Horse Racing in the Urban Area; Preliminary Resolution of the Senate Review</p>
<p>The "horse racing" proposal has been repeatedly discussed in the Third Review Committee without any results. Yesterday afternoon, Lu Shidao, the convener of the Third Group, specially moved this case to the end of the discussion so that everyone would have ample time, but Senator Lu added a sentence, "I hope that today we will, in any case, make a decision on the review opinion of this case." As a result, it was heated again. Opponents still insisted that "it should not create a gambling atmosphere," but some felt that there was no need to see the matter so seriously. In the end, Zhao Dihua, a senator, made three review conclusions based on the three points of the mayor's motion, and also served as a merged review opinion on the eight proposals related to the racecourse. After the review committee passed it, it was submitted to the general assembly for discussion: (1) No horse racing is allowed in the downtown area (the original site of the old racecourse on Tibet Road). (2) Subsidies for charitable causes should be raised by the city government separately. (3) The racecourse site fund should be used by the city government, but the content of the racecourse site is complex, so the city government should conduct a detailed investigation and formulate measures before submitting it to the general assembly for decision. This finally brought a temporary end to this unsolvable problem.</p>
<p>Finance and Land Administration</p>
<p>The Third Group reviewed a total of eleven cases of finance and land administration yesterday. Together with the previous meetings, the group's review of the proposals has been completed. The review report is divided into three groups: finance, land administration, and the Executive Yuan's Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Agencies. Each group is responsible for the review by three senators. In addition, ten petitions from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chemical Raw Materials Industry Association, etc., will also be reviewed by three people in groups before discussing them together at noon today.</p>
<p>Regarding the two motions submitted by the speaker: (1) For the approval of the Provisional Senate's transfer of the Chinese Kuomintang First District Seventh Branch's telegram requesting exemption from rent increases, (2) For the approval of the Provisional Senate's transfer of the 35th year's in-kind payment of field tax in this city. Those that are the same as the proposals reviewed by the group will be handled in combination.</p>
<p>Administrative Expenses to Be Appropriately Reduced; Business Expenses Not to Be Changed</p>
<p>The Ninth Budget Review Committee met yesterday at the City Senate in Fuming Village, Fuxu Road. After the group's review and discussion, it was believed that, based on the principle of downsizing and simplifying administration, the administrative budget should be reduced by 20% according to the original budget. However, the business expenses will not be changed. In addition, the group's senators will no longer receive the 10,000 yuan in transportation expenses issued to each senator by the City Senate in order to reduce the city government's expenditure. At the same time, the police bureau's mounted patrol team is deemed unnecessary and should be abolished. It is heard that the Review Committee plans to increase the city government's budget revenue for the second half of the year by 3 to 4 billion yuan to expand its business.</p>
<p>The budget review will be re-examined by the group's conveners Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, He Yuanming, etc. If necessary, the subcommittee meeting will be held again for discussion.</p>
<p>Pang Jingzhou's Theory of Hygiene; Can Be Done by Just Beating a Gong</p>
<p>Pang Jingzhou, convener of the Eighth Committee for Reviewing Hygiene Proposals, contributed his personal opinions on improving public hygiene to Zhang Wei, Director of the Bureau of Hygiene, at the Review Committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Senator Pang believed that in this time when hygiene needs to be urgently solved, if we want every ignorant person to listen to the instillation of hygienic knowledge, it is both impossible and useless, because hygiene is not a task that can be done by any one agency, but a campaign that requires everyone to participate in and promote its implementation. Therefore, he hoped that the Bureau of Hygiene could launch several hygiene campaigns that are large in scope and simple in method.</p>
<p>For example: First, the "handwashing" campaign. We all know about handwashing in our daily lives, and this campaign will certainly sound laughable, but in fact, if we can urge the children to wash their hands before each meal, the workers after their jobs, and the farmers after planting their fields, then their chances of getting sick can be reduced a lot, and the percentage of infectious diseases can be reduced a lot. "The amount of soap consumption in a country can represent the level of civilization of a country," Senator Fan Shouyuan also agreed.</p>
<p>Second, the "bathing" campaign is the same as the handwashing campaign. People in many remote rural areas are simply baffled by the idea of bathing. This is also something that must be promoted. Third, the infant mortality rate is increasing. We cannot compare with foreign children eating milk, milk powder, and cod liver oil. In fact, children who have enough breast milk are not weaker than those who only eat cod liver oil. Enough breast milk can make babies grow tall and strong. In the fields of Brocade, the fertilization should not use new fertilizer, because if the new fertilizer contains infectious bacteria, it is very dangerous to water it on the vegetables. If we can prepare more furniture and store the manure for two weeks, the bacteria will die. Infectious diseases can be reduced a lot in an invisible way. Elderly farmers know that using old fertilizer can make the vegetables fat, but they do not know that there is also the benefit of reducing infectious diseases. Fifth, fish should be raised next to farmland. Many farmers take the small fish in the pond to eat, which is not right. They all know that frogs are beneficial to rice fields, but they do not know that small fish also have the same advantages. There are several kinds of small fish that love to eat mosquitoes. After eating malaria mosquitoes, malaria can be reduced. There is a small fish in South America called "Gabbaqia" that reproduces very quickly and is very good at eating mosquitoes. If we can get a little bit of fish to spread in the pond, its function is very great.</p>
<p>Finally, Senator Pang said: "These things can be done by having a guarantor take a gong and beat it down, why don't we finish it"!</p>
<p>Discussing Education and Culture Proposals; Unanimously Recommended Increasing Funding; Supervision Should Be Increased on Private School Fees</p>
<p>The Sixth Review Committee's discussions on education and culture proposals were quite heated, but because yesterday was the last subcommittee review, time was very limited, so only the principles of the last few proposals could be decided, and the conveners would prepare detailed review opinions for submission to the general assembly.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to request the city government to increase education funding, some argued that it should be increased to 25% of the city government's total funding, while others argued for 30%. The result of the vote was nine to six votes in favor of the 25% recommendation.</p>
<p>There is an excessively high phenomenon in the fees charged by private schools. One of the proposals is to request the municipal government to reduce private school fees and strictly supervise them. During the discussion, some people argued that the words "reduce" should be changed to "stipulate," and some argued that they should be changed to "review." Finally, the original proposal was revised to "Please ask the municipal government to strictly supervise the fees charged by private schools."</p>
<p>The review committee members almost unanimously advocated abolishing "respect for teachers' fees" which is a de facto disguised tuition fee. Everyone spoke out one after another, painfully recounting that the dignity of teachers has been hurt, the parents of students have a bad impression of the school, and that national schools should never charge fees. As for insufficient teacher compensation, another way should be found to increase it. Finally, the proposal was passed that the city government should stipulate that public secondary schools should not charge "respect for teachers' fees" from the next semester onwards, and national schools should not charge tuition fees or any other fees, and that the base salary of teachers should be adjusted and increased in accordance with the treatment of public education personnel.</p>
<p>The other proposals that passed the review were: (1) District guarantee organizations should liaise with the education authorities and be responsible for assisting in promoting national education. (2) Promote radio education to instill knowledge in the people. (3) Women's schools should add courses on obstetrics and gynecology. (4) Practically improve municipal schools at all levels and strictly prohibit principals from holding concurrent positions in accordance with the principal appointment and removal laws. (5) Pay special attention to science education. (6) Promote family education. (7) Request national banks to provide loans for cultural undertakings. (8) Add public libraries, etc.</p>

<p>Resolution Passed Contains Three Points</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 17th] The Paris Peace Conference tonight reached its first resolution regarding the status of Trieste.

<h3>United States Should Strengthen Aid to Our National Government: The Argument of "Life Magazine"</h3>
<p>The September 2nd issue of the American magazine "Life" published an editorial entitled "China's National Crisis," inferring China's current situation. Its argument is that China will be the prelude to World War III, and the battlefield and decisive battleground. Its words are very insightful. The author, Henry Van Dusen, was in China this summer and exchanged views with Chinese and American people, and deeply knows the current situation of China. Life magazine, with this article as its editorial, can be used as a representative of the magazine's views. The following is a summary of the main points:</p>
<p>Van Dusen said: "China today is encountering a serious national crisis unprecedented since the founding of the Republic of China. Analytically, there are about three points: 1. Economic Dislocation; 2. Civil War; 3. Political Corruption. The above three are mutually cause and effect, economic dislocation is enough to cause political corruption, and Communist activities; political corruption, is enough to cause economic dislocation, and Communist activities; also because Communist activities, the national economic dislocation is more and more unmanageable, the government's prestige is gradually reduced; the government's prestige is gradually reduced, and economic dislocation, and Communist activities, are even more impossible to clean up.</p>
<p>"There is a difficulty in reconciling the question between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; the Kuomintang regards the current government as orthodox; and the ultimate goal of the Communist Party is to rule the whole of China; after Japan surrendered, the Soviet Union left the Northeast and all the weapons of the Japanese army to the Chinese Communist Party, which made the Chinese problem even more complicated and serious.</p>
<p>"Marshal's special envoy has been running around to mediate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for half a year, but with little success. How will today's American foreign policy be determined? The following is based on the current situation, try to analyze.</p>
<p>(1) American foreign policy should focus on the future Third World War, and prepare in advance;</p>
<p>(2) The future Third World War will be a conflict between the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, and the United States, Britain, and Western European countries;</p>
<p>(3) The future Third World War may not break out in Europe or the Near East, but in East Asia; at that time, the United States and the Soviet Union will inevitably have a conflict here; even if the Third World War does not break out in East Asia, the United States and the Soviet Union will inevitably have a career in East Asia; East Asia will also be the place where the Third World War decides victory or defeat;</p>
<p>(4) The future development of the overall situation in China, therefore, should be noted by the United States. If we do not fear reality, North China is actually the front line between the United States and the Soviet Union;</p>
<p>(5) Therefore, the United States must give the Chinese government real assistance today. Fortunately, today's Moscow still regards Europe as its main target, and in the near future, it may not immediately risk a conflict with China or the United States in East Asia.</p>
<p>"Then can the United States withdraw its aid to China? The answer is no; if the United States withdraws its aid, then the Chinese National Government will be forced to lean towards the Soviet Union, which is a great diplomatic threat to the United States.</p>
<p>"Today's China, foreign aid and domestic reform, should be equally emphasized, and one is indispensable. Without foreign aid, domestic reform cannot be achieved; if domestic reform is not achieved, foreign aid is also useless; therefore, the policy of the United States, on the one hand, should give aid to China, on the other hand, it should make the leaders of China responsible for reorganizing domestic affairs."</p>
<p>Van Dusen is a religious leader, and his remarks have nothing to do with the government; nor can they represent all the views of the United States, but his observation. The point of analyzing China's position in the world situation is worthy of attention. If unfortunately, it is said that in the middle, unfortunately, the Third World War must happen; even more unfortunately, the Third World War actually happened in China, and even more unfortunately, China became the main battlefield of the Third World War; and even more unfortunately, China's internal war today, or even the prelude to the Third World War; we try to think about the tragic situation of China's future, what will it be like! Fellow Chinese descendants, if they can take into account the future of China, discard prejudices, and jointly plan for innovation, today's opportunity can still be turned back; if not, then the suffering of 400 million people will be hundreds of times greater than that of Spain in the past. I hope that the people of the country will wake up soon! (Translated by Hu Huanyong)</p>

<h3>Western Newspaper Praises the Municipal Council: Compares it to US State Legislatures</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] According to the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post", the Shanghai Municipal Council's reviews and inquiries are a "security" mechanism for venting popular pain. A reporter went to observe the progress of the Municipal Council's work today, and how the general municipal councilors perform their duties of planning municipal policies. According to the level of discussion and speeches in the Municipal Council and the demeanor of the general councilors, it is very similar to the state legislatures in the United States. If a US state legislator came to Shanghai to attend the Municipal Council, they would feel comfortable. This morning, the councilors launched the most fierce attack on the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, which also made the reporter believe that if the Chinese people want to learn and practice democracy, the Municipal Council is a very ideal opportunity to manipulate the General Assembly. The performance of the Municipal Council in a week's work is far beyond what people expected. In the past week, even in today's attacks, the councilors have been able to speak freely in a free environment, even if there are criticisms of the government, they are not at all salty. This morning, Mayor Wu also attended, and told reporters during the break: Although the municipal government is inevitably subjected to councilors' criticism from time to time, he is deeply grateful for the atmosphere of free discussion. He believes that if the citizens of Shanghai can learn and practice democracy at the same time, then true democracy will surely be realized in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Reception and Investigation Team Holds Regular Meeting: Five Councilors Attend and Participate</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Municipal Council representatives participating in the Investigation Team, Zhao Junhao, Zhu Xuefan, Ma Junshuo, Wang Jian'e, and He Yuanming, attended the team's regular meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. The five councilors expressed at the meeting that the representatives are in the position of local public opinion organs, and in terms of work, they hope to focus on cases of local institutions. Moreover, the two councilors among the representatives, Ma Junshuo and Wang Jian'e, are famous lawyers in the city, so the team publicly elected them to pay more attention to cases related to legal matters. After the meeting, the reporter visited Team Leader Zhang and asked about the process of handling confidential cases. According to reports, the goal of the team's investigation work is to "deal with things, not people", although there are also cases where "things" involve "people", but the main object is still to judge whether the "things" are right or wrong. Regarding the work of the team in the past 50 days, it will soon invite people from all walks of life to make a public report. The reporter also asked how he felt about the city's reception work. The team leader replied: "Not satisfied", and believes that the Executive Yuan should bear more responsibility.</p>
<p>The reporter then asked Councilor He Yuanming, who recently went to the team to work, about his opinions on the investigation work. He said: The investigation team is a public opinion institution, and all reception officials who engage in private gain, corruption, and bribery must be investigated one by one. "If the investigation is not clear," we must also be responsible. As for whether the government handles it or not, that is not our business.</p>
<p>Also, any citizen who has suggestions for the investigation work or has reports on corrupt reception and handling matters can send a letter to the Municipal Council to forward it to the team.</p>
<h3>Major Drug Trafficking Case via Air Transport: Main Culprit Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Police Bureau cracked down on a large-scale, well-organized drug trafficking organization by air transport in the middle of last week.

The Police Bureau received the report the earliest and first arrested Li Hongying, a Taiwanese, who was responsible for transporting drugs, in Room 12, No. 4 Kunshan Garden on the 11th of this month. Then, on the 14th, Li Dingguo, Zhang Gengtian, and his wife Zhang Fengpeiying, three Taiwanese, were arrested in No. 54 Yishunli, Baoshan Road, and two packages of morphine weighing sixteen taels were found, worth about 24 million yuan. They also confessed that the person in charge of the organization stationed in Shanghai, Sun Zhicheng, lived at No. 9 Jishenli, Wuchang Road. The police chief Feng of the second section of the Police Bureau led the police to rush there and waited day and night until he was arrested on the 14th, and a secret organ for storing stolen drugs was found there. According to his confession at the police bureau, he was entrusted by Zhang Yiren to be responsible for sales in Shanghai. All the drugs were transported by plane from Tianjin by Li Hongying. Each drug transport used a specially made suitcase with a hidden bottom. It has been carried out six or seven times, and each time the profit can be millions to tens of millions of yuan. Zhang Yiren himself has an uncertain whereabouts, either in Beiping or going to Tianjin. After the Police Bureau telegraphed Pingjin to request an investigation, it received a reply saying that the person had come to Shanghai. The Police Bureau dispatched all officers and began to arrange police networks, and until the late evening of the day before, it was finally arrested in Room 311 of the Royal Hotel, along with his brother Zhang Yisheng, his wife Zhang Li Bingkun, and his concubine Zhang Xie Kuidi.

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Wu Bingchang, Chairman of the Joint Supply Council of Seven Nationally Designated Primary and Secondary School Textbook Publishers (including Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, Shijie, Dadong, Kaiming, and Wentong), reported to the Zhabei Police Bureau on the 12th that the Council, under the order of the Ministry of Education, is responsible for printing nationally designated textbooks, and other publishers are not allowed to reproduce them. There is a printing factory at No. 10, Lane 247, Xizang North Road, inside the bamboo fence of the Jimin Hospital, which is privately reproducing the aforementioned nationally designated textbooks. The Branch Bureau Chief Ying Zhichun ordered the Second Section Chief Wang Shou, Police Chief Wang Yingzhou, Wu Qiming, and Tao Rongsheng to rush to the above-mentioned location. On the spot, they confiscated over 200 zinc plates and 31 reams of printed and bound books, including textbooks on Chinese language, general knowledge, arithmetic, civics, national language, history, geography, and nature, covering primary, elementary, and middle school levels. The foreman, Wu Chusheng, was taken to the Bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, the books were reproduced and sold by the Bei Xin Bookstore. The Bookstore's manager, Li Xiaofeng (from Jiangyin), was summoned for questioning. Li directly admitted the fact and stated that the Bookstore's reproduction of the Seven Publishers' Joint Supply Council's books did not begin this year. It started in Lichuang County, Anhui, in 1942, at the request of the local people. The plaintiff accused the Bookstore of infringing on copyright and publication rights. After mediation, the Bei Xin Bookstore appointed its representative, Li Xiaofeng, to contact the Seven Publishers' Joint Supply Council for a settlement, willing to compensate the Council for a loss of 10 million legal tender. All the reproduced textbooks and zinc plates were to be confiscated and destroyed. The plaintiff, considering their relationship as fellow publishers, is requesting the police to withdraw the lawsuit. Therefore, there may be hope for a settlement in this case.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At approximately 12:00 AM the night before last, the Guoguang Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 659 Meizhou Road, Yangshupu, Pudong, was operating a night shift.

The Zhangjiabang area is located in a winding and extremely dark area. When the four men were approaching, they were suddenly ambushed by three or four thugs holding newly sharpened butcher knives. Without explanation, the thugs blocked their way and stabbed Yu Zhonggui in the back with the sharp butcher knife, piercing his chest.

<h3>Mrs. Liu Hangchen's Body: Encoffined Yesterday</h3>
<p>Liu Hangchen, publisher of Yishi Daily, and his wife, Chen Yuying, came to Shanghai this spring and stayed at Room 701 of the Jinmen Hotel. Mr. and Mrs. Liu had insomnia and took sleeping pills every night to fall asleep. Initially, all the medications they took were purchased domestically. Recently, a relative of Mrs. Chen returned from the United States and, hearing that the Liu couple suffered from this condition, gifted them American-made sleeping pills. Unexpectedly, Mrs. Chen was unaware of the maximum dosage of the medication. When she went to bed on the evening of the 16th, she took the pills as usual. Soon after, she felt unwell and realized she had made a mistake. She initially tried various methods to induce vomiting, but to no avail. She got up to call Dr. Pang to come for treatment, but her strength was already failing, and she fainted beside the chair. Mr. Liu heard the news and rushed over. He continued to call, but Mrs. Chen could no longer speak. He personally took her to Dahua Hospital.

<h3>Central Bank Begins Work to Standardize Banknote Designs</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] This reporter recently interviewed Liang Ping, Director of the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, and Tian Fu, Deputy Director, to inquire about the standardization of banknote designs. They stated that the Bank is constantly considering the standardization of banknote designs and the simplification of types. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Bank was limited by manpower and material resources and could only utilize existing paper, ink, and printing equipment. Therefore, the banknotes printed may not have been fully standardized in terms of patterns, paper quality, or types. After the victory, there are now sources for paper quality, printing equipment, ink, and other raw materials, and efforts will be made to improve. Among the more than 20 types of banknotes issued in the past, the inapplicable types have long been discontinued. The banknotes that are already in circulation are withdrawn and discontinued when they are returned. However, this matter cannot be accomplished overnight and will require time to achieve a standardized effect.</p>

Chen reported the letter to the Police Headquarters, which sent Section Chief Feng Qishan, officer Chen Xianrong, and Officer Ding Wenjiang in disguise to wait. It was not until 2:00 AM on the 13th that three suspicious men arrived together. After entering the lane, they repeatedly looked down and examined the second trash can.

<h3>Failure to Tear Ticket Corner: Treated as Tax Evasion</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Finance Bureau has recently noted that a small number of theaters do not tear the corners of tickets when viewers enter the theater, but instead send staff to collect the complete tickets near the end of the show. This measure may involve using one ticket twice, creating suspicion of tax evasion. To eliminate tax evasion, the Finance Bureau has stipulated that all entertainment venues must tear the corners of tickets when viewers enter the venue in the future. If it is found that ticket corners are not being torn or that theaters are collecting complete tickets that have been sold, it will be strictly treated as municipal tax evasion. The Finance Bureau hopes for public cooperation in assisting the bureau's supervision and implementation, and viewers are welcome to report any violations. Once verified, the informer will be awarded the corresponding bonus according to the method of reporting tax evasion to provide encouragement.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>

After investigation, the residence of the president of our court is not related to the office space required by the district office. The above information is by no means factual.

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Plans to Improve Secondary Education, Submitting Proposal to the Municipal Council for Approval</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has drafted a five-year plan to improve secondary education and construct secondary education zones, submitting it to the Municipal Council for approval. The proposal states: Since the invasion of the enemy, Shanghai's education has suffered severe destruction. After the victory, active restoration efforts have been underway. In terms of the number of schools, it is not insignificant. However, regarding their quality, apart from a few schools with self-built and relatively complete campuses and teaching equipment of a basic scale, most schools are renting civilian houses and making do with inadequate facilities, urgently requiring improvement. Regarding secondary education, there are 19 municipal schools and 207 private schools, with nearly 100,000 students enrolled, all youths aged 12 to 18. Their character is not yet fully formed, and their knowledge is limited, making them highly malleable. If they are not provided with excellent education at this time to cultivate their minds, nurture their character, enrich their knowledge, and strengthen their physiques, it would not only be a lifelong disservice but also endanger the nation and its people. The majority of schools have cramped classrooms, insufficient light, polluted air, and excessive noise, with many deficiencies in material conditions. Teachers are merely fulfilling their duties in teaching, and students view schools as temporary lodgings. Supervision and discipline are lax, and the situation is handled perfunctorily, leading to worrying spiritual deficiencies. The urban area is densely populated, and land prices are high, making it especially difficult to raise funds for building school buildings and improving equipment. Moreover, the social customs are decadent and avaricious, and the pervasive influence of the environment deeply affects people. The education provided by schools cannot counteract the assimilation by society, making it exceedingly difficult for students to resist temptations and stand independently. Therefore, if we do not want to cultivate youth, then so be it. However, if we want to cultivate youth who can bear the heavy responsibility of national construction, then it is imperative to improve the current secondary education in Shanghai. To improve the current secondary education in Shanghai, it is essential to create an excellent educational environment for young people. Recognizing this, the Bureau has proposed the construction of four major secondary education zones in the quiet suburbs of the city. A plan has been specifically formulated and is being actively implemented, including: (A) Principles for constructing secondary education zones; (B) Methods for constructing secondary education zones; (C) Steps for constructing secondary education zones; (D) Key points for constructing secondary education zones. The implementation details of each item are explained in great detail.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Distributed at Original Price, Second Batch Still 30,000 Pieces, Textile Construction Matching Yarn Number Missed Again Yesterday, Kuixing and Tiannv Northeast Hot Selling</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Yarn Factory Joint Distribution Committee held a regular meeting at 3 PM yesterday afternoon. As a result, 20-count cotton yarn was offered for sale, with the standard amount of 598 pieces for private enterprises, fully allocated according to the application amount. Textile Construction allocated 1373.5 pieces, but the application amount reached more than 6200 pieces. The selling price was based on 400 pounds of 20-count Double Horse, still 1.3 million yuan per piece.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the joint distribution agency, the first batch of yarn allocation groups totaled 30,000 pieces. As of yesterday, 26,453.5 pieces have been sold and allocated. Currently, the remaining amount is 1,298 pieces for various private factories and 2,248.5 pieces for Textile Construction. After the first batch of group yarn allocation is completed, the second batch of group yarn allocation will be planned, and the total amount may still be 30,000 pieces. Private factories account for about two-thirds, and Textile Construction accounts for about one-third. It is now reported that both parties have expressed agreement in principle, and once the specific decisions are made, they can be implemented.</p>
<p>To Eliminate Scalping Textile Construction Revisions Conditions</p>
<p>According to Wu Weijing, deputy general manager of China Textile Construction Company, speaking to this newspaper's reporter: Textile Construction allocated yarn yesterday, mainly to production factories, and the yarn numbers were not allocated. Textile Construction considered that the previous system of allocating an average of one piece per company was inappropriate. As a result, large production factories still need to buy from outside. As a result of the malpractices, Textile Construction's purchase permits, copper plates, warehouse receipts, and actual yarn have all become chips for market circulation and trading. Even the registration card of the factory's yarn number in Textile Construction has been transferred and accepted. In order to eliminate this malpractice, Textile Construction has decided to strictly screen the manufacturers applying for yarn allocation. Generally based on: (1) the production equipment of each factory; (2) the year of establishment of each factory; (3) the amount of industrial and commercial tax paid. In the future, the priority order and amount of yarn obtained by each factory will be determined based on these conditions.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Yarn Price Slightly Higher Has Three Reasons</p>
<p>Recently, the market trend is that the market price of each yarn produced by Textile Construction seems to be slightly higher than Double Horse. According to Wu's explanation, the reasons are: (1) Double Horse yarn is mostly sold in the Southern Gang, but recently, the ban on the transportation of yarn and cloth to the south has caused the price of Double Horse yarn in Shanghai to fall. (2) Most automatic weaving factories in this city are accustomed to using yarn produced by Textile Construction. (3) The yarn that Textile Construction has opened can be shipped in ten days. The shipping time for each factory in the private sector is not uniform.</p>
<p>Tianjin Gang Massively Scours the Market, Market Price Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market had a surprising surge. Tianjin Gang absorbed a large amount, because the sales in the East Nine Provinces turned smooth, and they favored the Kuixing and Tiannv brands alone. The opening price rose sharply, and both brands reached 1.435 million. However, the selling price of the same weight of distribution goods, such as light-weight Golden Rooster, Dafa, and Double Horse Flying Tiger, was only 1.367 million, and buyers were lacking. By contrast, Kuixing and Tiannv can be said to be extremely lucky, especially since Double Horse did not move in South China, and the price hovered between 1.512 million. The other 20-count brands also rose by 20,000 to 40,000 yuan. Fine yarn and 42-count double yarn have not changed much.</p>
<p>Factories Aggressively Purchase, High-End Grey Cloth Surges</p>
<p>The market price of high-end grey cloth, due to the purchase by a certain factory, Textile Construction's V12-pound fine cloth purchase permit opened yesterday, plus 8,000 yuan, and was continuously snatched up. The Chak Lung fine cloth has not been opened, but the demand for high-end silk-finishing is very strong, so there is this high price. Other non-branded colored balls and non-branded fine cloths still have little rise or fall.</p>
<h3>Stock Trading Gradually Prospering, Brokers May Increase, Bank of Communications Sends Personnel to Handle Settlement Affairs, Wing On Spinning Unit Increased to 5,000 Shares</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Since the free China Communications banks in Shanghai are responsible for handling stock settlement matters for the stock exchange, the Chinese side has designated Ruan Jiaxian and the Communications side has designated Chen Mutang to work at the institute respectively. At the same time, a batch of staff members were borrowed from the two banks to handle settlement matters at the institute.</p>
<p>It is reported that there are a total of 34 brokers in the second batch waiting to supplement their documents. Once the documents are fully supplemented, they will be submitted to the ministry for review.</p>
<p>After each stock opened yesterday, the initial market price did not fluctuate much, but the asking price in front of the Xingguang trading counter was enthusiastic, the trading was frequent, and many transactions were made. After 11:00, the trading counter of Wing On Spinning and Meyer became active again. Wing On Spinning once fell due to sellers dumping, and the market price once fell, but it turned due to buyers turning strong, and the market price rebounded. Xingguang was booming because a certain bank aggressively entered more than 800,000 shares, and there was a saying of recognizing three and giving two, and the buying sentiment was strong, and the market price has not been weak. Lilian and Huafeng also showed a prosperous trend. After the high-heat stocks were low, there was a good game for a while, and the Guangdong gang initially entered and then exited, so there was a return, but the field cut a lot of greed, and the advance was blocked. There was also the North gang and Qianzhuang gang cutting a lot in the field, and the situation was still tired near noon. Except for small stocks such as Xingguang, all stocks unanimously saw low.

<p>The rise in rayon prices has continued. It has become more and more unstoppable. At 1:00 a.m. yesterday, the opening price of No. 120 Tianqiao Youguang was 3.15 million yuan, up 100,000 yuan at the close. The afternoon was even more chaotic, with the highest shout being 500,000 yuan, and the final result was 450,000 yuan at the close, a sharp increase of more than 300,000 yuan from the previous day.

The silk goods factory plate was slightly higher, and sales gradually picked up. Huajin crepe was still sluggish, and the price was only 100 yuan weaker than the previous day. Generally, small silk weaving factories were hit by the high price of rayon and will be forced to stop.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>Although there were two or three large households who were quite willing to take it, due to the accumulation of sellers, there was still a sense of pressure. Tongbing opened at 2,150 yuan in the morning, and once pulled up to 2,250 yuan. However, due to the conclusion of more scattered, it fell back to 2,100 yuan near the close. As a result, it rose slightly by 30 yuan compared with the previous receipt. A and B fell slightly by 20 yuan, D was slightly better by 30 yuan, and Tung W was flat. The turnover was no less than 4 million yuan in face value.</p>
<h3>Gold and Banknotes Rise and Fall Significantly</h3>
<p>The enthusiasm of buyers was reduced yesterday, and they were forced to slightly reduce the morning opening price to about 2.14 million. After opening, it was stable for a while, and pressure was applied. Buyers retreated in the face of difficulty, and since 2.145 million, the selling intention was slightly shared, and the downstream was informed. After 10:00, the central bank allocated 96 strips at a price of 2.13 million, and after that, it hovered between 2.23 million and 2.135 million. It was slightly stable at noon, and in a flash, it fell back to about 2.13 million.

It fell to 3,355 yuan at noon, and there was a slight improvement in the afternoon, but there was little change. As a result, it fell by 5 yuan compared with the previous receipt. The price of Hong Kong notes was uncertain, and there was a lot of struggle around 700 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly by 5 yuan compared with the previous receipt.

<h3>Sugar Price Review Committee Decides to Reduce Sugar Price by 10,000</h3>
<p>The sugar price yesterday decided to reduce the price of medium sand and raw sand by 10,000 yuan each, and the rest remained at the original plate.</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was as soft as before, with medium sand white falling slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, to 147,000 to 5,000 yuan. Raw sand was 114,500 yuan, ordinary green sugar was 415,000 yuan, and the Ding Qing Tai Wu round arrived.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills Shutting Down One After Another, Cost 20,000 Yuan per Bag, Market Price Currently Only Selling for 14,000 Yuan, No Hope for Relaxation, Association to Hold Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Due to high wheat prices recently, the market price per dan reached about 23,000 yuan. And wages are expensive, resulting in a flour manufacturing cost of 20,000 yuan per bag. However, the market price per bag is only 14,000 yuan. As a result of production, all reported losses. However, on the one hand, the export of flour is banned. Therefore, although Guangdong, Fujian, Qingdao and other places need flour urgently, the market price per bag ranges from 25,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan, it is still impossible to obtain flour from this city. The original flour exporters in various places abandoned flour and took wheat. As a result, small and medium-sized flour factories along the Jinghu line have been closed one after another. According to the reporter's investigation, the closed factories are Xin Kang and Jiangnan in this city, Shunfeng in Wuxi, and Wufeng in Kunshan. There are five factories in Suzhou, including Wufeng, Yu Yu, Hefeng, Mainland, and Gongxing. In addition, although large flour mills are still open at present, most of them are milling flour on behalf of the joint head office. The income from the industrial bank can offset two-thirds of the regular expenses, so it can still be maintained reluctantly. However, if the current unfavorable situation of the flour industry continues, large flour mills will have to close down. It is now reported that the Fourth District Flour Industry Association (including the flour industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces and Beijing and Shanghai) will hold a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow to discuss rescue measures.</p>
<h3>Big Players Acquire Yinglian, Foreign Stock Market Improves</h3>
<p>Although the foreign stock market is still weak, Yinglian suddenly has a big player buying a lot, and with this help, it immediately rebounded. The big stocks were also brought up, but the small stocks still have little new buying activity and are still unsustainable. As a result, Yinglian rose by half a percent compared with the previous receipt, and Yisha Huidefeng Yeguang rose slightly. The steel and shipping industries were flat, Yibei and Paper fell slightly, and Xiangtai was still searching for more, which was extremely stable.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Blocks Are Firm</h3>
<p>The market price of bituminous coal screened blocks is gradually firm because the Coal Business Joint Business Office received a verbal notice from the Distribution Department of the Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to temporarily suspend the allocation of bituminous coal blocks to the wharves in Pudong, and the quality of the Kaiping train screened blocks of the Kaiping Huoche Coal Wharf on Maigen Road in Puxi is inferior. The market price of bituminous coal chips is still flat. Since the price of white coal screened blocks has risen, the sales are quite inferior. The market situation of Hongji white coal chips is slightly tight.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bank Launches Handicraft Loans, 2 Million per Household, 5% Interest Rate</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Bank has been serving the citizens, and has successively launched municipal public pawnshop loans and education loans. Recently, there are a large number of small-scale family handicrafts. Most of these handicrafts have short capital and a narrow scope. The special launch of family industrial loans is to provide assistance. The application procedures are as simple as possible, and its regulations and attached documents have been submitted to the municipal government for approval. All legitimate small-scale family industries with fixed addresses and handicraft equipment that have joined the trade association can apply to the bank for a loan. The amount is up to 2 million yuan per household, the interest rate is tentatively set at 5% per month, and repayment in installments is allowed according to the regulations. The bank is actively preparing for this loan, and it will be opened as soon as it is ready.</p>
<h3>Negotiating Short-Term Sterling Exchange Rates to Eliminate Risks for Exporters</h3>
<p>In addition to purchasing and processing packing loans, the Central Bank has recently been handling matters related to establishing effective short-term British pound exchange rates to support exporters. For foreign exchange transactions outside the British pound bloc, the bank will act as a backstop to avoid the impact of drastic increases and decreases in foreign exchange rates. The methods are as follows: (1) Exporters who intend to transport export goods to countries in the British pound bloc for trading may first determine a reasonable foreign exchange rate, which will become effective after being approved by the Central Bank. Once the foreign transaction is completed, if the foreign exchange rate falls, the Central Bank will provide compensation according to the difference. (2) The time limit is one week. (3) Only genuine exporters are eligible. According to the person in charge of the bank speaking to reporters: This bank will spare no effort to support the export business, and will try to realize anything that is beneficial to exporters. Except for the US dollar, the fluctuation of other foreign exchange rates changes greatly within a few days. Moreover, due to the slow communication of telegrams, exporters often suffer unexpected losses. In view of this, the bank has specially sought remedial measures. All exporters who negotiate a foreign exchange contract price in advance within the prescribed validity period can freely handle the profits if the foreign exchange rises after the transaction is successful, and the prior agreement is invalid. If the foreign exchange falls, the bank will compensate for the difference, so exporters can avoid losses from sharp falls in foreign exchange rates. It is expected that foreign telegram exchanges and transactions can be resolved within a week at most, so the validity period is one week. The targets are exporters of tung oil, bristles, silk, tea, etc., and those who are not genuine will be rejected.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Stabilizes, Wheat Prices Rise Accordingly; Oil Prices Fall Below Review Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the rice market was firm, but continuous arrivals totaled more than 7,000 stones. The market weakened at the close, and the result was relatively stable compared to yesterday's japonica rice, as was indica rice. High-quality Baiyuan and Xinyuan rice had some scattered transactions, still falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Medium and low-quality rice was ignored. Flour sales were brisk, continuing to rise by more than 100 yuan. Nanyang wheat sales were smooth, rebounding by 600 to 700 yuan. Northern white wheat sales were sluggish, but stocks were low, and prices remained strong. Wheat bran continued to fall by 200 to 300 yuan. Vegetable oil prices rebounded, with all oils falling below the review price. Retail and wholesale sales were not strong, and the trend was temporarily stable. Soybean sales in this city and other ports were weak, and medium and low-quality beans still had few transactions. Corn fell by another 1,000 yuan. Yellow velvet beans from Hankou arrived in large quantities, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts recovered after weakening, rebounding by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Longans Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new longans from Quanzhou, Tong'an, and other places continued to arrive. The higher prices were 275,000 to 280,000 yuan, followed by 260,000 to 270,000 yuan, 255,000 yuan, 195,000 yuan for Zhongqiao longans, and 160,000 yuan for old stock.</p>
<h3>Too Few Barges, Traffic Obstruction; Tianjin Trade Has Not Returned to Its Former State</h3>
<p>Although Grain Prices Are High, Wages Are Cheaper Than in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to a gentleman from the financial community in this city who recently returned to Shanghai from Tianjin, the situation of export materials in Tianjin is as follows: Pig bristles are now in the first place, and are a major export from our country. Other exports include hides, straw braid, carpets, casings, etc. Walnuts, almonds, and medicinal materials are transported in small quantities. As for wool and eggs, which used to occupy an important position in North China's exports, they are now in short supply due to traffic obstruction between Tianjin and the mainland. In addition, the washing and packing of wool and the steaming of eggs, as well as various equipment and factory buildings, have not yet recovered, so they are far from the pre-war standard. However, people in all industries are preparing. Once traffic resumes and goods arrive, the former situation will gradually recover.</p>
<p>The general economic situation in North China is actually better than in Shanghai. Although food prices are higher than in Shanghai, wages are cheaper than in Shanghai. This is very beneficial to export trade. In the financial sector, there is also a feeling of capital shortage. Therefore, the money market is very tight, and the underground interest rate has reached between 10% and 20%. However, speculative psychology is not as strong as in Shanghai. Therefore, the financial market is relatively stable.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacles to Tianjin's trade at present are nothing more than two points: (1) There is a shortage of barges in the port, and ships arriving from overseas cannot be unloaded on schedule. (2) Poor traffic in the mainland affects the transportation of export materials from various places to Tianjin. Fortunately, the construction of the new port is underway, and the initial equipment will be completed soon. Ships of 2,000 to 3,000 tons can pass smoothly and dock directly at Tianjin Wharf. At that time, at least the transshipment of goods can restore the past situation. In addition, if traffic and public security in the mainland can gradually improve, the entire export trade of North China will occupy an important position in the country's foreign trade.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Old Red Tea Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>The domestic sales of black and green tea are still active in the shops and tea houses on this street and in the Suzhou-Wuxi area, and the demand for Wenzhou old Mao red tea is particularly strong. The owners have raised prices again, and the market has repeatedly broken records, reaching 70,000 yuan per dan, a sharp increase of more than 10,000 yuan compared to the previous price. Dadechang Tea Company absorbed 50 dan, which was sold by Yilong Tea Warehouse. Other varieties are consistently firm.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Rice Arrives in Shanghai for the First Time, Along with a Large Batch of Sugar</h3>

The bottom of the bottle is made of copper screws, covered with a rubber top and bottom support. It is said that the bottom of the bottle can be guaranteed to be free from rust for a long time.</p>
<h3>Is It Reasonable to Increase Payments for Pre-War Deposits? (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xie Tingxin</p>
<p>2.  Disconnect from the Very Period Excessive Profit Tax Ordinance and Income Tax Law. The judgment stated that "banks have greatly increased the amount of their currency in other aspects of investment." Even if the bank's surplus from investments other than government bonds and loans suddenly increases, the bank's expenses also increase due to rising prices. The bank's expenses are also generated by handling the affairs of depositors, which is also a legitimate cost. If the bank still has a huge surplus after deducting expenses, the state must collect a considerable amount of income tax and excessive profit tax on this surplus. A portion of the "increased amount of currency invested by banks in other aspects" has already been attributed to the state. Moreover, the Income Tax Law and the Excessive Profit Tax Ordinance do not stipulate that reserves must be set aside for pre-war debts, surpluses must be retained, and a portion must be eliminated. In other words, the legislative aspect has tacitly recognized that the currency value increased by the bank's investment in other aspects is the bank's own surplus, without any debt portion, and imposed the prescribed tax rate to be included in the national treasury. If depositors must calculate the loss of currency value, the bank will inevitably re-cancel the final accounts of the past eight years, and the state will refund the income tax and excessive profit tax levied on the bank, starting from scratch, so that the matter can be fair. However, the Income Tax Law, etc., were also passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated and implemented by the National Government, which cannot be easily changed. This is the second point neglected in the judgment.</p>
<p>In terms of the matter</p>
<p>3.  Whether depositors bear the loss of bank operations. The main reason for the bank to compensate thousands of times is that the bank "greatly increased its currency value." Conversely, if the bank greatly reduces its currency value, can the bank reduce the payment to depositors? If the bank's surplus can affect the amount of depositors' deposits, the depositors are no different from shareholders of the bank, and the bank will settle the profit and loss every day so as to settle accounts with depositors every day. The same amount of deposits, deposited in banks A and B, will increase and decrease differently due to the different operating results of the two banks. And it may be completely destroyed and unable to sue the bank. The rights and obligations of depositors to the bank must be balanced, and we cannot only focus on rights and ignore obligations in the opposite situation. This is the third point neglected in the judgment.</p>
<p>4.  The impossibility of payment according to currency value. The change in currency value is not only true during the war, but it has never been the same for two years, two months, or two days before the war. The difference between peacetime and wartime is only a difference in degree. Banks have fixed deposits due every day, and they will inevitably pay different amounts every day. Banks have become a currency value insurance company, similar to the "price index group insurance" recently established by the Central Trust Bureau. However, the deposit contract accepted by depositors does not specify the payment of the currency value index, and the laws and regulations followed by the bank's operation and the national laws do not have provisions for the bank to protect the currency value. After the currency value has fallen sharply, to order the bank to bear its sole responsibility, how can it be said to be fair! Furthermore, the government has now stopped issuing banknotes since July and is trying to suppress prices and gold prices. If the situation develops and the measures are appropriate and the currency value gradually increases, the bank may also file a lawsuit against depositors in a few years to reduce the payment of deposits a few years ago, also on the grounds that "it is neither the responsibility of the plaintiff nor could the plaintiff foresee it at that time." According to the aforementioned regulations and the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan, depositors will also undoubtedly lose the lawsuit. If this cycle continues, the economic society will never have peace, and the bank will only be engaged in litigation. This is the fourth point neglected in the judgment.</p>
<p>In short, our country has suffered so much from this great change, and there are countless victims, and there are also many who have made a fortune in the national crisis. The recovery of the currency value of bank deposits is only a very small part of the liquidation, and it is a fallacy to target the bank as the object of liquidation, and it will lead the economic society to a state of chaos. The liquidation of the past that cannot be liquidated is of no help to the construction of the economic society in the future. Recently, I heard that the government is drafting a compromise plan for the payment of pre-war deposits. I sincerely hope that it can consider it carefully and take care of all aspects, especially the points raised in this article, and pay attention to them. (End)</p>

<h3>The Investigation Is Not Appeasement: The Amazing Masterpiece of the Taiwan Provincial Investigation Team</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>A line of people including Head of the Fujian-Taiwan Region Enemy and Pseudo Industry Reception and Investigation Team, Liu Wendao, has been in Taiwan for over 40 days. They have successively conducted on-site investigations of various production units in the provincial capital, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, and listened to the opinions of the people. Recently, the results of the team's secret investigation have been silent. A Taipei newspaper said that it was not investigation but appeasement, while a Shanghai newspaper, based on a speech in a public office, commented as "eulogizing and praising merits." However, at a reception for reporters at 3 pm on the 12th before his departure, a violent bomb was dropped: Officially announcing the public punishment of Yu Baixi and Ren Weijun, the two bureau chiefs of the Monopoly Bureau and the Trade Bureau, and transferring them to the court. This shows that Mr. Liu, with a cautious and compassionate attitude, delivered a sensational masterpiece, proving that the team was not appeasing.</p>
<p>Reporting Two Bureau Chiefs</p>
<p>Monopoly and trade are special names for specialization in this province. Because of the particularity of the business, they also represent the particularity of Taiwan Province. The two agencies have been controversial due to insufficient personnel and technology. This time, the two bureau chiefs were reported by the investigation team. According to Head Liu, whether or not the persons in charge should be guilty should be judged by law. And he further revealed that the inside story of the case is that the Monopoly Bureau underreported 500 million tons of salt, and the Trade Bureau underreported more than 30 kinds of large quantities of received materials. He particularly solemnly stated that the investigation is not only aimed at the two bureaus, but the two bureaus have obtained concrete evidence. They used almost the same method as in Shanghai, first openly soliciting confidential reports, then obtaining written reports on the reception from relevant agencies, and finding contradictions in the comparison, and using the reports as the most powerful evidence.</p>
<p>Requesting Public Opinion Support</p>
<p>Head Liu sternly and passionately clarified the team's position, vigorously explaining that there is no need to obtain understanding or even flattery from the local authorities. If there are any special opinions on this, it fundamentally denies Mr. Liu's character. Within 40 days, a total of 384 documents were received. Some of them involve civil disputes and minor disputes handed over to the chief's office for processing. All case files must be taken to the joint secretariat in the capital to continue receiving and continue processing, and personnel will be sent to Taiwan for on-site investigation when necessary. He said: Whether the local government handles it or not, and how well it does it, needs public opinion support. Public opinion has more power than military, political, and economic power!</p>
<p>Special Circumstances of Reception</p>
<p>Committee Member Zheng Kuiyi and other members pointed out that the difference between Taiwan's reception and the domestic one is that the land belongs to an isolated island. Unified reception is prone to corruption in the initial chaotic moment. After this period, it is watched by the people of the province, so it is obviously impossible to hide a large amount of materials. He praised Chief Chen's integrity, and the command headquarters detained more than a dozen people, including the major general chief, and the court also arrested several people. They were all handled before and after the investigation team came to Taiwan. When reporters asked how many people the investigation team had detained, Head Liu remained silent. He said that as of now, only a few people.</p>
<p>He deeply regretted those who deliberately misinterpreted his speech, but he said that misunderstandings occurred due to language barriers, and it was reasonable to be scolded. It was decided on the 14th of this month to return to Shanghai and then to Beijing. Before leaving, he kept secrets from reporters. The team did not encounter resistance in its work in Taiwan, but he did not want to cause more trouble before leaving to avoid accidents. Head Liu and his party have achieved results in their hard work, and he has a compassionate heart for corrupt people.</p>

<h3>Establishing Craft Factories to Take in Beggars</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, recently, I have investigated the area from Xujiahui to Middle Lin Sen Road in the city, and there are many beggars along the way, especially in the small vegetable market. Sometimes they steal things and randomly grab vegetables and leave. Most of the people who are robbed, when they return home, find that their things have been stolen, and they curse a few words, and that's it. If they are sent out by the owner to purchase, there is a risk of being scolded and beaten. Under this bad phenomenon, the relevant authorities should be asked to take in these vagrants as much as possible or expel them from the country. The best way is to establish a vagrant craft factory to teach them the simplest small crafts. On the one hand, it can improve the city's appearance and make it look better for foreigners. On the other hand, it can promote the progress of small industries. How appropriate! However, the funding for establishing it is quite large, and the cooperation of the city's large merchants and philanthropists with the government is required to have a successful hope. I am a worker and have no power to do so. I can only express my sincere opinion to the public, hoping that the authorities will adopt it, which is also a blessing for society. (Kong Yunda)</p>
<h3>Taking Radical Measures Against Hawkers</h3>
<p>Editor: The section of South Shanxi Road (from Tianjin Road to Ningbo Road) is full of hawkers. After the police station ordered a crackdown, they rebounded in less than three days and remained as before. I really don't know what the relevant authorities think. Where is the dignity of the clear order? Moreover, this road is a concentrated point of commerce, a gathering place for money, and vehicles are frequent, often causing traffic jams, which is very inconvenient for pedestrians. The business of roadside stores is greatly affected. In addition, vegetable scraps and residues are piled up all over the ground, which is especially unhygienic and damages the city's appearance. I hope the authorities will resolutely take radical measures. (Shou Ding)</p>
<h3>Please Prohibit Clothing Stores from Selling Loudly at Night</h3>
<p>Editor: There are fifty clothing stores, large and small, on Shilu in this city. They have always had the bad habit of selling loudly. Several months ago, they were ordered by the authorities to be prohibited. Recently, several small stores have defied the law and rebounded. They are still selling loudly, and even at eight or nine o'clock in the evening, this sound can still be heard, which not only violates the authorities' ban, but also disturbs public sleep. (Ye Dexin)</p>
<h3>Taking Action Against Scalpers at Movie Theaters</h3>
<p>Editor: There are very few places for legitimate entertainment in Shanghai, so everyone uses watching movies as a pastime. However, scalpers have monopolized all movie tickets. I sincerely point out that several large movie theaters can really be said to be scalpers' nests. They sell tickets openly in the theater, bargaining calmly. Even when I don't buy his ticket, he still makes an abominable counter-proposal. Sometimes they also talk and talk with the staff in the theater. I don't know how many moviegoers are running around and suffering because of this group of scalpers! The black market is a legacy of the Japanese rule, and we must eliminate it. I now propose three points, and I respectfully ask the security authorities to consider implementing them: (1) The authorities should order plainclothes officers to go to the theater, and it is easy to investigate this group of scalpers. With the supervision of the authorities, scalpers cannot sell a large number of tickets in their pockets. (2) Order each theater to post a notice prohibiting viewers from buying black market tickets (this was originally there, but it has now been torn off). (3) If the staff in the theater collude with the scalpers, the movie theater supervisor should be responsible for investigating and handling the matter. All the viewers in Shanghai's movie theaters can prove everything mentioned above is not a lie. Perhaps the municipal authorities themselves have suffered from scalpers when watching movies, but why do they turn a blind eye? (A Student of St. John's)</p>

<h3>Ordinary Education in a Free Society</h3>
<p>— Shen Youqian</p>
<p>Report of the Harvard University Committee (General Education in a Free Society) Published by Harvard University in 1945, 267 pages, US$2.00</p>
<p>In the United States in 1870, there were only 80,000 secondary school students and 60,000 university students nationwide. By 1940, there were as many as seven million secondary school students and 1.5 million university students. (In addition, there were one million students in non-full-time vocational schools and supplementary schools.) In these seventy years, the population of the United States has only increased threefold, while the number of university students has increased nearly thirtyfold, and the number of secondary school students has increased nearly ninetyfold. This quantitative increase is accompanied by qualitative changes. To meet the different needs of various students, schools have had to change their curricula and greatly increase the types and numbers of subjects. Because local conditions are different (for example, the average annual salary of teachers in Mississippi is 559 yuan, while in New York State it is 2,604 yuan, a difference of nearly five times), students have different abilities (for example, a smart 13-year-old child can be compared to an average 16-year-old child, while a backward one is only equivalent to an average 10-year-old child, a difference of up to six years), different family backgrounds, different outlooks, and different interests, this development of departmentalized elective courses is inevitable and must continue to exist in the future, but it inevitably produces two dangers: one is that students inevitably become isolated from each other, and the other is that it is not easy for students to integrate what they have learned. Therefore, Harvard University, which pioneered the elective course system, specially formed a committee, hired twelve professors, and spent three years and 60,000 US dollars, hoping to find a common, consistent, and coherent general center in the ever-changing curriculum. This book is the report of this committee.</p>
<p>The book suggests that in the four years of secondary school (according to the Chinese secondary school system, which is divided into three years for junior high school and three years for senior high school, originally copied from the United States, but the American school system does not emphasize uniformity, and the 3-3 system has been popular in China for a long time, but it has not yet been nationally adopted in the United States, so the book refers to the old four-year secondary school system), general education should account for more than half. Three-eighths of the half should be in the humanities, three-eighths should be in the natural sciences, and two-eighths should be in the social sciences. A portion of the remaining half of the curriculum should also be in general education. For students who do not plan to go to university, each of the three subjects of humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences should account for another one-eighth, while students who plan to go to university should have further research in at least one of these three subjects.</p>
<p>For universities, the book's recommendations are limited to Harvard College (which can be said to be the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Harvard University) and are not intended for general application. In the four-year, sixteen-course program, the committee believes that six courses should belong to general education, of which three are relatively preliminary and should be taken in the first two years, and three are more advanced and should be taken in the last two years. The three advanced courses can be freely selected, but are limited to courses specifically recognized by the committee as having general educational value, and must not belong to the student's chosen major. The three preliminary courses are specifically designed: one is "Great Works of Literature," one is "Western Thought and Society," and one is "Essentials of Physical Science" or "Essentials of Biological Science."</p>
<p>But the main contribution of this book does not lie in the quantitative allocation of courses, because the difference between general education and specialized education does not lie in its content, but in its methods and purposes. The goal of general education is to cultivate free people and citizens who can think effectively, express their own thoughts, make appropriate judgments, distinguish values, and respect truth and the happiness of the public.</p>
<p>The book is full of insightful observations, such as: "Language training is the common task of all teachers." "Teachers know that their influence on students is not limited to the subjects they teach." "The study of foreign languages, in addition to the commonly recognized instrumental function, also has a liberating effect... Discovering that the meaning of foreign words has something that cannot be directly expressed by native words... may have a value equal to Copernicus's discovery." "General survey courses have their place and are quite important, but the result often stifles students' interest and fails to stimulate their curiosity to continue their research." "Education that is limited to memorizing some half-understood, scattered items, or replaces careful research with effortless explanations, will not succeed." "Too many children are nominally clever and learn too little."</p>
<p>The writing throughout is also very beautiful, unlike the official jargon of most reports. In one place, a long passage from Mencius is quoted (The trees of Ox Mountain were once beautiful), and the erudition of the committee members can also be seen here.</p>
<p>Chinese education has begun to increase dramatically in quantity. How to improve the curriculum to meet the different needs of various students is a major issue at present. But the current university curriculum seems to have become overly specialized, especially in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, whose purpose is different from that of medical and engineering colleges, which are dedicated to training professional talents, and it seems that not enough attention has been paid to general education. This book is available for researchers to consult.</p>
<h3>Basic Knowledge of Literature</h3>
<p>— Zheng Jia'ai</p>
<p>Most young people who love literature and art, whether they are majoring in liberal arts or science, like to read some lighter works in their spare time, such as novels, poems, and plays, in addition to the textbooks and reference books assigned in school. Most people do not bother to study those dull literary theories; some people get a headache when they see abstract and numerous terms such as "subjective objectivity," "form," and "essence"... and so on; some people finally make up their minds to finish reading a thick theoretical book; but if you ask them the reason why, they don't know where to start; this kind of trouble is not that young people don't want to read them, nor that there are no books in bookstores, but that there is a lack of excellent, concise, and easy-to-accept literary theory books.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the group's "Basic Knowledge of Literature" gave us a lot of help in this regard; the whole book is divided into twelve chapters, with about 40,000 words; it is quite easy to read, and now I will briefly introduce its central ideas separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The essence of literature—literature is a reflection of the reality of life; Gorky said: "The task of literature is to reflect things and describe the life of labor, and to present the truth in images—characters and types." This definition not only explains the essence and characteristics of literature, but also marks its distinction from philosophy and science.</p>
<p>(2) The artistic and social nature of literature—in the literary debates of the past century, the reconciliation and contradiction between "pure literature" and "social literature" has been an unresolved issue, and until now, we have not seen a real sign of the end. However, according to the opinions of the new art theorists, they do not regard the "artistic nature" and "tendency" of literature as opposed, but regard it as a kind of quality that starts from literature itself. The social tendency of literature will not distort reality or harm art, but is consistent with the truth of art.</p>
<p>(3) Literature and reality—literature must be based on reality, start from reality, and at the same time conquer reality, defeat reality, stand above reality, see its future, and give it a general expression.</p>
<p>(4) Material and theme—material is an independent existence of objective reality, which is not related to the writer's subjectivity, while the theme is something that has been subjectively recognized by the writer; once the material is selected by the writer as the theme, his intention is revealed. A creator should expand his horizons, take creative material from all aspects of the changing reality, and enrich his literary thoughts, while fully developing the breadth of the material and the diversity of the theme.</p>
<p>(5) Literary creation method—the same material, after being processed by two writers with different worldviews, will produce completely different meanings. This method of determining the observation and induction of things is called "creation method" in literature. From material to theme, it must pass through the "method" bridge. A creator's worldview is not determined by his family background, but by the society in which he is born.</p>
<p>(6) Romanticism—Gorky said: "The two basic trends or tendencies in literature are realism and romanticism." Romanticism prevailed in Europe from the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 19th century, with Germany being the most developed. Goethe and Schiller were the pioneers of this doctrine. They advocated the worship of human nature and the ideal of mankind, and emphasized fantasy and personal indulgence; British romanticism was not so simple; it can be divided into two tendencies: one is the negative school—their characteristics are to express pure personal indulgence, the past recollection, and natural yearning; their attitude towards reality is concealment and retreat; the representatives of this school are Wordsworth and Scott. The other school is the active school—their characteristics are to oppose autocracy, monarchy, and tyranny; they have a passion for transforming the world, to pursue freedom and liberation; and to declare war on reality; the representatives of this school are Shelley and Byron. The difference between the two schools, simply put, is that the former pulls back reality, while the latter promotes reality.</p>
<p>(7) Realism—realistic writing originated in the early 19th century and prevailed in the late 19th century; it originated with the rise of the propertied class. It was created in France by Stendhal and Balzac; although Balzac focused on the scenes of real life, he still could not avoid imagination and subjective exaggeration; in fact, the real founder of realism was Flaubert, who imitated things purely with an objective attitude and calmly, completely rejecting the artist's fanaticism; Zola took him as his model. Although the works of this school exposed the darkness of capitalist society, the social status of the writers limited their development; therefore, they only stopped at exposure and criticism, and could not see its future and way out.</p>
<p>(8) New Realism—the creative method of this school of thought is to overcome the pure subjective romanticism and pure objective realism of reality; it is based on the standpoint of the new advanced class, and penetrates the writer's subjectivity and social objectivity; and grasps the truth of reality; their purpose is to arouse the readers' enthusiasm and courage to fight for the ideals that have not yet been realized.</p>
<p>(9) The generality of literature—writers must remove the special and accidental parts from the phenomena, and focus on its universality and necessity, and extract its essence from individual phenomena—this is the process from the actual "facts" to the artistic "truth," and the truth of literature can only be discovered from here.</p>
<p>(10) Language of text (writing)—literature is expressed through language; without language, there is no literature. The language of literature is not the daily spoken language, but the correct language that has been selected, transformed, and refined by the writer; but in some cases, in order to make the characters appear particularly vivid and realistic, the spoken language of the people must be applied, and even local dialects cannot be lacking.</p>
<p>(11) The form of literature—content and form are essential elements of literature that cannot be ignored; in an excellent literary work, these two aspects must be appropriately matched and naturally unified; if you only pay attention to the beauty of the form, that is to "cover up the simplicity and poverty of the spirit." Therefore, an author should strive for simplicity and clarity in form, rather than gorgeousness or skill. Today, the genres of literature can be roughly divided into four categories: 1. Novels (long, short, and medium) 2. Poetry (narrative poems, lyric poems, and epics) 3. Drama (multi-act plays and one-act plays) 4. Reportage literature.</p>
<p>(12) Literary legacy Ding Xin's realistic writings must widely absorb various literary heritages. The so-called acceptance is not imitation and unconditional learning of characteristics; but to use their own subjective critical attitude to screen out the dross from the heritage of world literature, extract the essence, and then, through digestion, make it become the blood that nourishes oneself and opens up one's own development.</p>
<p>"Basic Knowledge of Literature" is only a thin little book, with a total length of less than two hundred pages; but the author has spent a lot of effort on it; he had to refer to many world literary masterpieces and literary theory books; to analyze them, compare them, and then write them down systematically after careful thinking; when he explains a phenomenon, he often cites examples, which not only makes it easy for us to understand, but also can adjust the dull atmosphere; for example, when he compares the styles of "realism" works, he cites a paragraph from Flaubert's "Madame Bovary" and Balzac's "Cousin Bette" each, so that we can read them. In this way, we can deeply understand it and appreciate literary masterpieces.</p>
<p>Each chapter of this book has a brief question at the end, which is very suitable for individual self-study or small group discussion and research. In addition, the bibliography attached to each chapter makes us familiar with many great literary books, which can be regarded as a "harvest" outside of the harvest.</p>
<h3>Criticism and Appreciation</h3>
<p>— Zhu Li</p>
<p>Someone once made a suggestion: a critic must also be a writer or have had creative experience. This opinion is correct, but it cannot be turned into a formula.</p>
<p>A writer has his own style and judgment in his writings, and it is naturally unavoidable that there are subjective components; in a work, there is his cultivation and insights. Critics who adhere to their own standards and give the same criticism to any work not only give the author a slander, but also give the reader a formulaic concept, damage the value of the work, and also control the reader's appreciation.</p>
<p>The reason for advocating that a critic is also a writer is to hope that when criticizing a work, he will appreciate the process of the work's creation, from appreciation to criticism, integrated in a situation. In this way, with appreciation as the basis of criticism, feeling love for the work, the criticism will be cautious. Creation is free, an educator may also be a writer, and his works may be completely different in the two aspects. A critic uses his expertise or insights in a certain area to criticize the work. This is the appreciation of an expert. Criticism and revision of advanced theories or research are needed; but for beginners, the scale should be relaxed and care should be given.</p>
<p>A critic does not have to be a writer, but must be an appreciator. He is enthusiastic about reading works in a certain area, can understand the content of the work and also understands the author's hard work. He loves other people's works more than he loves his own. This kind of critic will not use his own subjectivity and formula to measure a work, nor will he force readers to go on his path of ideas.</p>
<p>Criticism and appreciation are different. A critic can be an appreciator, but an appreciator is not necessarily a critic. Most readers are appreciators. They learn about the author from a book or a work, appreciate the work, and get education and instruction from it; they do not need to criticize a work, but they also have their own appreciation standards. The appreciation of a work by an appreciator is, on the one hand, the value of the work's response to him, and on the other hand, his own level of understanding: a satirical work that someone takes as a joke comes from the level of understanding.</p>
<p>A critic must be an appreciator, but does not have to be a writer, because he is familiar with and loves other people's works, sympathizes with the author's creation, and puts forward his opinions in appreciation. This is his criticism; putting forward negative criticisms or positive praises of the work is the critic's task.</p>
<h3>On Culture</h3>
<p>— Shen Liren</p>
<p>Edited by Wu Wenzao, Journal of Sociology, Series A, No. 1</p>
<p>Written by Bronislaw Malinowski, translated by Fei Xiaotong et al., published by Commercial Press, Shanghai edition, May 1946</p>
<p>The so-called culture, from a static point of view, is the way of life of human beings; from a dynamic point of view, it refers to the degree of achievement shown by human beings in conquering nature. From the meaning of its connotation, then, in a broad sense, it is the formation and accumulation of all common sense and knowledge; while the narrow cultural view is to explain the progress of academic research.</p>
<p>Academic research can be differentiated from the general into various specialized parts, such as the transformation of physics and chemistry into various different branches of science; it can also be abstracted and synthesized from fragmented theoretical systems to form another common discipline, such as the gradual development of political economy and economics, leading to the description of its commonality by sociology. Now, on the one hand of social science, since the creation of sociology, the common outline of the entire social science has been proposed; but in natural science, there is no comprehensive high-level knowledge structure, but the so-called "cultural science," which explains the entire process of human intellectual development, is budding and growing. Although it is only stagnating in the stage of defining the category and pondering the terminology, it is also enough to see the efforts of the forward-looking scholars in general. Previously, connecting natural science and social science, there was only an extremely incomplete "anthropology," which slightly talked about the evolution of human beings, and now with the higher "cultural science," it can be regarded as the harbinger and prototype of the confluence of the two major sciences of nature and society.</p>
<p>It's just that when "cultural science" is not yet enough to be cultivated into a unique science, it has to be subordinated to sociology, and serve as an introduction to the study of human intellectual development, which is why this book belongs to one of the "Sociological Series." The Sociological Series is a great attempt by Dr. Wu Wenzao. In his plan, there are a total of three major series, the purpose of which is to study the Sinicization of sociology and to provide basic sociological reference books, and "Series A" is dedicated to the pure study of sociological theory and methods.</p>
<p>The author of this book, Malinowski, is an authority of the functionalist school of sociology in contemporary times. His view of mankind does not start from the theory of natural evolution alone, nor does it judge from historical analysis alone, but believes that culture is the overlap of human means of life, and its purpose is only to meet the needs of daily life. He has done comprehensive and precise field observations in several communities, and has published many classic epoch-making works. This book is just a very simple basic paper.</p>
<p>In this book, he economically discusses the important scope of all cultural organizations, and narrates it with enlightening strokes. First, he talks about the differences in culture, due to the inheritance of tradition or the differences in regions, and then establishes various chaotic cultural routes. Then, he explains the general principles of culture, and uses a new classification method to incorporate each aspect of culture into an independent unit. After making a simple definition of cultural science, he puts forward the banner of functionalism, explaining the author's standpoint on the cultural view, and then briefly relating it to the role of culture. The following six chapters are devoted to the study of the social part of culture, regarding the forms, functions, and combinations of social institutions, their basic generative nature, cultural coercion, and ritual activities. The next thing to study is strange words, which is a specific method of discussing the spiritual part of culture. Finally, the origin and progress of spiritual culture are examined fragmentarily and one by one. Between these seemingly inseparable three departments, consistent material conditions are linked, occupying an important position in culture. Finally, "Summary and Conclusion" determine the value of experiential cultural theory, because people not only need to understand the causes of culture, but also should know what culture is, how it happens, and how it changes; then, they can deeply understand the essence of culture, and transform culture to meet the civilization that human beings expect. Of course, all are based on the functionalist theory.</p>
<p>In this long article, what is best explained is the issue of witchcraft, which, along with the physiological basis of witchcraft, transitions to religious beliefs and their functions, which is not easy to obtain detailed explanations and conjectures in other works discussing the same issue.</p>
<p>For the remaining one-third of the book, Dr. Wu Wenzao's "On Cultural Forms" is a supplementary work corresponding to the "On Culture" section. What he explains is all the most primitive outline of cultural theory, almost entirely explaining the value and practice of the three-factor division of culture, and involving the description of the eight original elements of culture. The so-called three-factor division of culture is the further theory obtained by melting together Marx's material monism, Hegel's spiritual monism, and Durkheim's social monism, combining the three of material, society, and spirit into one, and pointing out the relationship and inseparability between them. If this book lacks this part, it will make readers only obtain fragmentary knowledge and cannot understand it thoroughly.</p>
<p>To create a complete and beautiful "cultural science," it is naturally necessary for scholars to work hard, but in this book, you can also see some rough outlines. If you further supplement and organize it, I am afraid it will not be a matter that can only be hoped for forever!</p>

<h3>On Literature and Reality</h3>
<p>— Chen Mo</p>
<p>Before discussing the interrelationship between literature and reality, we might as well first provide a brief explanation of their individual meanings:</p>
<p>What is literature? It is difficult to give a specific and precise answer to this question. However, according to general opinion, literature is an art that uses abstract written symbols (or language) as a tool and means of expression. Its special function is to reflect the reality of society and express the author's thoughts and emotions in a figurative way, while also manifesting the author's desire for improving reality.</p>
<p>What is reality? It is the modern, truthful existence. It is not the old history of the past, nor the beautiful dreams of the future, but the current, bloody, and vivid truth. To put it more profoundly, reality is composed of the real vertical aspect of historical development and the real horizontal aspect of social life development.</p>
<p>Literature is a reflection of reality and an expression of the author's thoughts and emotions. Reality, however, is literature's vast source of inspiration and the sacred ground for nurturing the author's thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>If there is no literature, reality will lose its colors, light, and power of the era and appear weak, mediocre, and desolate!</p>
<p>If there is no reality, there simply will be no literature. At the very least, there will be no literary flowers with any era value or vitality!</p>
<p>Literature draws from reality and improves it. Reality provides for literature, and, due to the improvement of literature, it becomes more enriched. This cycle of mutual exchange and evolution continues, thus allowing the reality of the era to continuously develop forward and literature to continuously radiate brilliance!</p>
<p>However, reality is not equal to literature, and literature is not simply reality.</p>
<p>Because the various phenomena contained in reality are very chaotic and vulgar, while what literature expresses is pure and refined, like pure steel forged from refined iron, or brocade woven from tangled silk.</p>
<p>The phenomena of reality are constantly changing, while what literature expresses is fixed, unchanging, and eternally immortal.</p>
<p>The essence of reality is hidden and obscure, while what literature expresses is clear and exposed.</p>
<p>The impression that reality gives people is chaotic and divergent, while what literature expresses is unified and consistent.</p>
<p>Because the purpose of all literature is to reflect the essence of true reality and the focus of the era, and to guide humanity toward a dreamland of truth, goodness, and beauty; but how can this highest purpose of literature be accomplished? That is, how can the essence of reality and the focus of the era be accurately reflected? For this, the author must first be a true and authentic person, pursue a true and authentic life, seek the truth of life within a true life, seek the truth of human life, and search for the fallacies of life and the truths of the social era in the hearts of the broad masses!</p>
<p>Furthermore, because a complete literary work is produced when the author melts objective reality into subjective thoughts and emotions and then expresses it through artistic form. This, in turn, involves the correctness of the author's subjective thoughts and the skillfulness of expression.</p>
<p>To go even deeper, whether literature is realistic or not cannot be judged solely by its subject matter. The most important thing is whether the theme contained in the subject matter is constructive and positive; whether the soul embodied in the work's inherent quality and realism is vivid and beautiful, great and vigorous!</p>
<p>Therefore, the relationship between literature and reality depends not only on the importance of having realistic subject matter, but the most crucial determining factor lies in whether the inherent soul and theme of the literary work are realistic.</p>
<h3>### "L'Assommoir" and Its Author</h3>
<p>— Li Hui</p>
<p>In his novel "L'Assommoir," Zola writes about the tragic female character Gervaise and two types of Parisian male workers of the time: the perpetually drunken Coupeau and the deeply concerned Goujet.</p>
<p>Gervaise was abandoned by her family at the age of fourteen because she had a child with the hat maker Lantier. When Lantier's meager assets were exhausted, she was kicked out by her husband, who was idle and needed to be drunk and have his fill of food and cigarettes. She then endured hardship and worked as a laundress to support her children and establish a new, happy family. However, the new family member, the tinsmith Coupeau, was also someone who needed to be drunk and have his fill of food and cigarettes. His earnings were insufficient to cover his expenses, and Lantier's shamelessness led him to rejoin the family, immediately consuming everything Gervaise had diligently built. Naturally, Lantier drifted to another woman, Coupeau died in a drunken frenzy, and Gervaise, after sending her son to learn a trade, toiled her entire life, eventually being gradually killed by poverty and loneliness.</p>
<p>When Gervaise left Lantier and got together with Coupeau, she also met the young worker Goujet. Goujet was a passionate Republican. We can learn from history books that this was the time when the First French Republic was being destroyed and the Second Empire was beginning. The ray of light that the Parisian workers had gained at the risk of artillery fire had been submerged, and ambitious workers were spending days of suffering in anxiety and frustration. In addition to the frustration with the current situation, Goujet also had complex issues with the woman he loved. His predicament can be imagined. Gervaise sympathized with him very much and hoped to break away from her husband and children and elope with Goujet, but her heart was willing and her strength was not enough. In the end, everyone was dragged down by life, past their youth, past their prime, until, when Lantier left and Coupeau died, Gervaise was already destitute in the tavern and on the streets at night. All ideals were illusory and unattainable, thus creating a tragedy in which everyone was heartbroken.</p>
<p>In "L'Assommoir," only Lantier succeeded. After consuming Gervaise's wealth, he drifted to Adèle, and when Gervaise recovered, he came to consume Gervaise again. Once he had used everything up again, he drifted to Virginie. He had nothing to worry about as long as he had the ability to toy with women.</p>
<p>But, of course, the final fate of Lantier, Coupeau, Goujet, and Gervaise was the same, just like the lives of most workers in the Parisian working-class districts. After living in ignorance from childhood to that low and cramped world, they had to toil their entire lives, unable to improve their lives, and could only collapse as their energy was depleted, regardless of whether they had good or bad intentions while alive.</p>
<p>We know that Zola was a naturalist writer. His artistic works emphasized factual research and experimentation. To write about a monk, he would live in a monastery; to write about patients, he would first observe the conditions of the ward in a hospital, the prices, the scenery outside the window, and even all external sounds, etc. He hoped that his works could accurately depict the truth of the society in which he lived.</p>
<p>The tragic scenes and unfortunate characters in "L'Assommoir" clearly contain Zola's thoughts and hopes. Zola, like Gervaise, Coupeau, Goujet, and Lantier, lived in Paris during the Second Empire. His personal experiences clearly moved his upright soul. He had great sympathy for the tricked workers, but because of his deep and broad compassion for the sufferers, he more earnestly criticized their lamentable behavior. He borrowed Goujet's voice to point at Paris and say:</p>
<p>"People are always doing useless things there, and the people will one day regret their inaction." Coupeau and Lantier are conscious bystanders suffering in a painful society. Gervaise is an unconscious bystander who wants to endure hardship and raise the gate of society with one hand but is ultimately crushed to death by it. The deaths of Coupeau and Gervaise clearly illustrate that the tragedy of bystanders will continue to be inherited by their descendants due to their bystanderism. This is clearly hinted at by the fact that fifteen-year-old Nana starts to work as a prostitute.</p>
<p>Of course, Zola did not conspicuously propose in "L'Assommoir" that Coupeau and others should immediately take action and how to act. He was a writer who only focused on experimentation. He only wanted to tell the world what the slums of Paris were like, how they worked hard like Gervaise, were slippery like Lantier, were dissolute like Coupeau, and were passionate like Goujet, how tragic their encounters were, and how they did not know how to extinguish the misfortune that was being inherited. He only said: They will regret it.</p>
<p>Zola was humble. He only wanted to provide his materials for people to study. Therefore, the sympathy Gervaise evokes in the readers is particularly strong. Although they are already dead, it seems as if they are still in regret.</p>

<h3>Barefoot Man (Sketch)</h3>
<p>— Ye Hong</p>
<p>On a hot day, the asphalt pavement was steaming and soft, almost emitting smoke.</p>
<p>The rows of lush shade trees along the road could not block the invasion of the heat wave, and everything in the space seemed unusually quiet. Only the cicadas hiding in the leaves were stretching their throats and desperately chirping.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a distant sound came:</p>
<p>Rumble, rumble...</p>
<p>Gradually, two shirtless men pulled a rickety cart closer. Dozens of large watermelons were piled on the cart. The green watermelon rinds and the men's upper bodies, scorched red by the sun, formed a very clear contrast.</p>
<p>One of the men, an old man with gray hair, felt his mouth so dry it was about to catch fire. He gritted his teeth, took a few more steps, and stopped, panting. He pulled down the yellowed white towel from his belt and wiped his head and face in a flurry. Then he glanced at the younger man:</p>
<p>"Water bottle, quick!" His voice was a little hoarse, and his nostrils felt strangely painful from the heat.</p>
<p>The young man slowly climbed onto the rickety cart and rummaged under the watermelons, pulled out a flat water bottle, shook it hard next to his ear, and handed it to the old man.</p>
<p>The old man suddenly pulled out the wooden stopper, put the bottle to his mouth, and drank straight down. It was so hard, so hard to catch a breath:</p>
<p>"Hey—" He paused and put the cart's belt around his neck: "Let's go!"</p>
<p>"Uncle, why don't you rest a little longer?" The young man rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>"Rest a little longer?" A bitter smile appeared on the old man's face: "Look at the time, the sun is setting. It's important to catch up with business. If you eat this kind of hard work, you can't complain about being tired... Alas!"</p>
<p>The old man was like a tired old horse, using all his strength to pull the rickety cart, taking one step at a time. The young man pushed behind the cart, the wheels heavily pressing on the soft, hot pavement, leaving two thick marks as the wheels rolled.</p>
<p>Several naked children were gathered around a broken water faucet by the roadside, taking a cool bath. The water gurgled out, and the children jumped up and down happily. When they saw the cart of watermelons being pulled over, several pairs of eyes swept towards the cart at the same time:</p>
<p>"Watermelon, look at the big watermelon!"</p>
<p>The rickety cart rumbled past again.</p>
<p>The rickety cart dragged across several roads, and the old man had to stop to drink water again. Suddenly, two guys in yellow uniforms flashed out from the roadside.</p>
<p>A tall guy in a yellow uniform shouted:</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"To... to Xujiahui." The old man quickly put on a smile, his voice shaking pitifully.</p>
<p>"Rules, do you understand?" Another guy put his hands on his hips, his eyes about to pop out.</p>
<p>"This... this..." The old man touched his buttocks, "this" for a long time but couldn't say anything. The tall guy stared at a big watermelon with wide eyes, and with lightning speed, he picked it up and was about to leave...</p>
<p>The old man kept bowing and making gestures:</p>
<p>"Sir, have pity on us! Losing one will make us lose money! Thank you!" The tall guy raised his head:</p>
<p>"Stop talking nonsense!" He took a big step and left.</p>
<p>The old man grabbed the yellow uniform with one hand, almost kneeling down.</p>
<p>"Sir, have pity on people like us, we really can't afford to lose it..."</p>
<p>"Damn it, you barefoot people really don't know what's good for you, let go, don't pull my clothes!"</p>
<p>"Please..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a loud smack, a giant palm slapped the old man's face. The old man felt a darkness in his eyes, and stars danced before him. He couldn't hold on any longer and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The young man quickly helped him up. He rubbed his burning left cheek and looked intently, but the yellow uniform was long gone.</p>
<p>The old man muttered angrily:</p>
<p>"Barefoot people! Barefoot people!... Suddenly he shouted: "Barefoot people are not people!"</p>
<p>He stood there blankly for a long time, sighed deeply:</p>
<p>"Let's go! It's almost there, consider ourselves unlucky today!"</p>
<p>The fireball in the sky had unconsciously rolled down the horizon, and the shadows of the two barefoot men gradually disappeared in the twilight...</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 37</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>In such times of fortune, he married a Miss Zisun and in the following years, gave him five family members; first a flower, then a fruit, then another flower, then another fruit. Finally, there was another little lilac. This was called alternating peanuts, a girl and a boy, etc. Before the sixth young gentleman Weizhu arrived, he suddenly changed his policy and became a follower of Mrs. Shan'e, implementing a birth control movement. So, Little Lilac was seven or eight years old, but the sixth young gentleman had not yet been born.</p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, this engineer is an out-and-out "family first" advocate. In other words, he is a model husband to his wife and a model parent to his children. He would rather eat and wear less himself, but always let his children eat their fill and dress warmly. Education? Of course, he would send every child to school and give them a proper education according to their age. He often said, "Even if we are so poor that we go hungry, we cannot let our children drop out of school."</p>
<p>Perhaps it was to make ends meet and provide for the children's food, clothing, and education, so before the age of forty, his hair had already turned gray, and his waist was a little crooked. But he generally did not appear old. Look at him still wearing a snow-white fine silk long-sleeved shirt, the cuffs rolled up on my forearms, white canvas shorts, thick white wool long socks, green silk sock garters, plus half an inch of longitudinals, dragging outside the rolled cuffs. Although his leather shoes were old, with overlapping wrinkles and several places with a tendency to crack, they were still polished brightly. This outfit portrayed the energy of an English gentleman.</p>
<p>Although he was full of sorrow, he wanted me to give him an idea; but the theme of his article was hidden in the second half of the article. What should I base it on to give him an idea? I knew he had already picked up half of the "Wei mouth" and half of the "Jing oil" tune. When he spoke, he had to go around several big circles, hinting from the side. Unless you can really let go of the topic, grab the end of the sentence, and wake up the topic for him, he would have to go around a few more circles.</p>
<p>"Old Wu, spare me, give me a topic," I pleaded, "If you don't give me a topic, what idea should I give?"</p>
<p>"Hey," he sighed greatly, meaning "you confused egg." He stared, "How should I say it? ... You are 'mud bodhisattva points gold! Pretending to be confused.' Look at you, last night, the big cannons were noisy, more lively than the New Year, don't you care a little bit?"</p>
<p>Understood. But it only counts as understanding half of it, that is to say, probably his theme is related to the war. Recalling what he just said, "You are a bachelor, ... my whole family" etc., maybe he wanted to discuss a safety issue in wartime?</p>
<p>"Brother Wu, are you saying that this Weixin shop is not very safe?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" He patted heavily on his thigh with his hand, "But you only said half of it, ... like my family, two old ones, five small ones, if we don't think of a way early, ... it's hard to say that we can just muddle through like this? ... We also have to muddle through, don't we?" His voice was a little off. If he continued to speak, he might be sad and shed tears.</p>
<p>This cannot be blamed on him. Leaving aside other things, let's talk about his children: Miss Meijun - his naming of the children includes an engineering design; for girls, Meijun, Lanjun, Zhujun, probably prepared that soon there will be a fourth Qianjin "Jujun", making a set. The sons are Shiren, Shiyi; this has already been cashed; in the reservation transaction, there are probably also Shili, Zhizhi; maybe there is also Shixin. This kind of name arrangement has some flexibility and is a smart way. In case there are only two sons, of course, only Ren and Yi can stand. If there are four, "Renyi Lizhi" is also a set. Suppose there is a spare one, isn't "Renyi Lizhixin" also a set? In any case, I think he is very confident, there is no problem with the wife, and there is no problem with himself as long as the environment is good.</p>
<p>Meijun is now seventeen years old, not to mention how beautiful she is, just say that she is a school flower in school, and when she returns to Changxindian, she is simply a rare flower, no, she is simply a Ganoderma in a deep mountain and valley. Isn't there also several thousand people in the Weixin shop area? Let's talk about women, pretty or ugly, also not a small number, but there is no one like Meijun.</p>

<h3>Fallen Leaves</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The leaves of the parasol tree in front of the window fell three or two pieces in a gust of wind, and the season changed. Cool autumn in September, the grass withered outside the Great Wall, although the trees are still green and the flowers are red in Jiangnan, the cold is coming, and the desolate image is gradually revealed.</p>
<p>In the small circle of Shanghai, life is the same, cars are galloping, women are passing, wine and dancing are joyful, and US dollars are flying around. The only difference is the color of the clothes, from light to dark, and the material from thin to thick. Chewing ice cream in the air conditioner is the same as in the heater.</p>
<p>Climate has become an embellishment of life, even a boast of life. Of course, there are also people who feel oppressed and threatened, and these people are not few in number.</p>
<p>Who wants to see Changbai Mountain and Songhua River? Even northern Jiangsu dares not face it! In these few days of the Senate, haven't we been provided with many problems around us?</p>
<p>It is better to prevent than to remedy. As the weather gets cold, for the sake of this winter, everyone should consider several serious situations that are about to come as soon as possible; it is better to rely on the people than on the government (the government still relies on the people, and the strength of the government is really difficult to be thorough). Everything we bravely undertake ourselves and plan out a proper solution.</p>
<p>If we sit by the stove drinking coffee and let some friends in single shirts wander in the cold wind, although it is an artistic contrast or foil, it is too cruel.</p>
<h3>News Data: Jiamusi, the Capital of Hegang Province, Will Become the Headquarters of the Northeast Communist Army</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>Speaking of Jiamusi, many people must feel a little unfamiliar with this place name. Indeed, this city located in the Songhua River has not received its news for fifteen years. During the period of occupation, it could not be found in the geography class in the upper Taiguo, so it is no wonder that everyone has not been very familiar with it.</p>
<p>But this city will become the target of everyone's attention. Because: In the war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the Northeast, the situation of the Communist Party has reversed sharply, and the Communist army stationed in Harbin has transported a large amount of military equipment to Jiamusi. According to the recent trend, Jiamusi will become the new headquarters of the Communist army in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Now, let me give a brief introduction to Jiamusi:</p>
<p>Jiamusi is the capital of Hegang Province, located on the south bank of the Songhua River in the center of the province, 200 miles northeast of Harbin. Huachuan County was established here during the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty. Later, due to floods, it was moved to Yuelai Town. (That is, the current Huachuan county seat.)</p>
<p>Jiacheng has extremely convenient transportation. Shipping on the Songhua River can carry ships of about 1,000 tons, sailing upstream to Harbin and downstream to the confluence of the Heilongjiang River. Land transportation includes the Tujia and Suijia railways, which are connected here from Tumen, 580 kilometers away, and Suihua, 282 kilometers away. At the same time, it is the central station of the highway from Harbin to Fuyuan. During the puppet Manchukuo era, air traffic in this area had three lines to Fujin, Harbin, and Yilan.</p>
<p>The enemy's deliberate operation has made the factories in Jiacheng flourish and the markets have increased greatly, and it has also become one of the major cities in the Northeast. The factors that have created the prosperity of Jiacheng, in addition to the superior transportation conditions mentioned above, are the abundance of agricultural products in the vicinity. The Songhua River basin near the city has fertile land for thousands of miles, producing beans and wheat. In the past, when the Japanese coveted the Northeast, they used armed forces to cultivate this area, which can also show the abundance of products here.</p>
<p>Jiacheng originally had a puppet Manchukuo "National Jiamusi Medical University" with two grades and 157 students. After the victory, when we went to take over, we did not expect that the school, called the "National University" of "Manchukuo", was full of Japanese students. There was no reason to let it continue to operate, so we closed it down. During the puppet Manchukuo era, Jiacheng's secondary schools also included Jiamusi Shidao School, Provincial Jiamusi National High School, Jiamusi Higher Girls' School, etc., a total of seven schools. The education implemented was of course completely "friendly country style".</p>
<p>The weather there is very cold, all belonging to the continental climate, with extremely short summers. The hottest time is no more than 80 degrees Fahrenheit, but in the coldest winter, the temperature often reaches minus 20 to 30 degrees. Every July, there is already a cool rain, the grass and trees wither in mid-August, and heavy snow will fall in September, and the cup flowers in the river will also freeze, and people and horses can travel freely on it. The weather in the Northeast is already cold now, and I can imagine that on the banks of the Songhua River, some people are still fighting for territory, with smoke and fire everywhere, which really arouses endless feelings!</p>
<h3>Good Words</h3>
<p>— Suo</p>
<p>One should not be complacent, but one should be content; complacency is in terms of knowledge and ability, thinking that one is already remarkable; contentment is in terms of material life, one should know to have restrictions and think one step back in everything. If so, your intelligence will gradually increase, and your material desires will be controlled; then, knowledge and happiness will run into your blood.</p>
<h3>Time is Money</h3>
<p>— Ling Yun</p>
<p>Although the shrewdness of us Chinese people may not match that of the Jews, our bargaining skills are definitely second to none. Whether in the vegetable market, the secondhand stall, the fruit stall, or the used bookstore, we can easily witness such dramas – haggling over a very small amount for a considerable amount of time. Their eyes are fixed on that number, calculating every cent, but ignoring precious time. I have also seen some self-made old gentlemen who are very frugal, preferring to save a few hundred yuan in transportation costs and endure half an hour in the scorching sun. This spirit is indeed admirable, but in reality, it is somewhat of a losing proposition. If they could use the energy spent walking on their business, they would naturally reap more than just a few hundred yuan.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a story I once heard about time:</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin set up a small bookstore in Philadelphia. One day, a stingy customer came to his bookstore. He wanted to buy a book but thought the clerk's price was too high, so he asked to see the owner.</p>
<p>The clerk refused, saying, "Mr. Franklin is very busy and doesn't have time to see you."</p>
<p>But the bored customer aimlessly rummaged through the bookshelves for more than an hour and insisted on seeing the owner. The clerk, unable to dissuade him, had to report to Franklin.</p>
<p>Mr. Franklin hurriedly put aside his writing and editing work and came out to see the customer.</p>
<p>"Mr. Franklin, what is the lowest price for this book?"</p>
<p>Franklin replied simply, "One and a quarter dollars."</p>
<p>"One and a quarter dollars? Your clerk only asked me for one dollar."</p>
<p>"Yes," Franklin replied, "then why are you preventing me from working peacefully?"</p>
<p>The idle customer, unsure whether Franklin was joking or serious, asked again, "Please tell me, how much does this book really cost?"</p>
<p>"Now, one and a half dollars."</p>
<p>"What? One and a half dollars – didn't you just say one and a quarter dollars?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I think you'd better take it for one and a half dollars now!"</p>
<p>The stingy customer immediately paid the price and fled.</p>
<p>Although this is just a story, it gives us a very powerful suggestion: many people ignore the preciousness of time and waste other people's valuable time!</p>
<p>In the office, we can hear a lot of trivial talk; in school, we can see a lot of misleading entertainment; and in society, there are countless time-wasting social engagements.</p>
<p>They are all thieves of Father Time.</p>

<h3>Too Few Animals in the City - We Need a Zoo</h3>
<p>— Paul</p>
<p>Shanghai's first municipal zoo was established on August 1, 1933, on Wenmiao Road in the Nanshi district, with a land area of 7.3 mu. In the autumn of 1934, at the peak of the zoo’s operations, there were 28 animal enclosures of various sizes. The zoo housed 32 species of mammals, including tigers, leopards, lions, elephants, black bears, camels, kangaroos, and sika deer. There were also 44 species of birds, including peacocks, white cranes, pelicans, mandarin ducks, herons, geese, pheasants, and eagles. The zoo also had 4 species of reptiles, including lizards, pythons, turtles, and soft-shelled turtles. In February 1935, the zoo even purchased a whale measuring over forty feet in length from fishermen in Chongming. Its head was about ten feet wide, its teeth as sharp as saws, and its flesh had been removed, leaving only its skin and bones, weighing over five thousand catties. In 1933 (from August 1, 1933 to June 30, 1934), the zoo's ticket revenue reached 20,468.44 yuan, and the number of visitors was 1,159,306. In 1934, the zoo expanded its area to 10.9 mu, and the annual ticket revenue was 17,818.16 yuan, with 1,059,781 visitors. After that, the annual number of visitors often exceeded one million. The zoo was under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. Preparations began in October 1931 and took two years to complete. During the "August 13th" Incident, the zoo moved some of the tigers and leopards to Gujiazhai Park for safekeeping, but the rest were destroyed. To this day, there is still no news of its restoration.</p>
<p>Tiger Suffers from TB</p>
<p>The public has a strong interest in zoos. In October 1935, when a tiger in the zoo died of tuberculosis, and on April 22, 1936, when a giant elephant in the zoo was electrocuted and died, the news spread, newspapers reported it, and the whole society was in an uproar, becoming a topic of discussion on every street and alley.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned municipal zoo, there was also a zoo attached to the Zhaofeng Park under the jurisdiction of the Public Concession's Bureau of Works at that time. The Bureau of Works began constructing Zhaofeng Park in 1914. At that time, the park superintendent, Mr. Creagh, specified in his plan to set up an animal section in the park. In reality, it was not until 1918 that the park began exhibiting birds and animals such as mandarin ducks, pigeons, owls, rabbits, goats, kites, and monkeys. In 1921, the Bureau of Works spent money to purchase an additional 2.939 mu of vacant land adjacent to the north of the park site to develop a zoo. The work was completed and opened in 1922, and it still exists today.</p>
<p>Educational Significance</p>
<p>Zoos are very beneficial to children's education. Most municipal authorities in countries around the world run zoos for the public to visit. Countries such as England, the United States, Japan, and France all have more than thirty or forty zoos. Taking the Ueno Park Zoo in Tokyo and the London Zoo as examples, an average of more than three million people visit them each year. The enthusiastic situation can be imagined.</p>
<p>Shanghai is China's premier city with a population of over 3.4 million. Currently, there is only one zoo, inherited from foreigners, and it is desolate, dilapidated, with a small area and limited "animals." Every holiday and festival, it is crowded and noisy, becoming a situation where people are watching people, and sightseeing is out of the question. Today, as municipal administration is gradually getting on track, we want to shout to the officials in charge:</p>

<h3>A Speech That Shocked the World - US Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace</h3>
<p>— Ganlai</p>
<p>The Chinese should not feel unfamiliar with the name Henry Wallace, because he once visited Chongqing, Kunming, and other places as a personal representative of the late President Roosevelt, and met and consulted with important figures from our country's party and government.</p>
<p>There is no room for hesitation; Wallace, in his capacity as Secretary of Commerce, delivered a speech on US foreign policy in New York City on the 12th of this month, advocating for friendly relations between the US and the Soviet Union, free from the constraints of British foreign policy. This speech shocked the world. The consequences of Wallace's views and speech are beyond the scope of this article. Here, we will briefly introduce Wallace's background and experience:</p>
<p>Henry Wallace was born on October 7, 1888, in Adair County, Iowa, USA. By the age of 21, he had already graduated from Iowa State University.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic about Agriculture</p>
<p>Iowa had an agricultural publication - "Wallace's Farmer" - founded single-handedly by Wallace's grandfather. After leaving school in 1910, he joined the publication as a staff member. At that time, the editor of the publication was his father.</p>
<p>In 1921, Wallace's father was summoned by President Harding to Washington to serve as Secretary of Agriculture. The editing duties of the publication were handed over to Wallace. At this time, he was thirty-three years old, at the peak of his youth and promise. He personally guided and completed many agricultural experiments, with satisfactory results, especially in the improved cultivation of a certain type of corn, which resulted in significant increases in yields.</p>
<p>Wallace's grandfather and father were both Republicans. Wallace initially joined as a Republican as well. Later, because of his sympathy for the policies of the late President Roosevelt, he declared his support for Roosevelt and switched to the Democratic Party in 1932.</p>
<p>Secretary of Agriculture</p>
<p>In 1933, the late President Roosevelt admired his talent and specially appointed Wallace as Secretary of Agriculture. His main political achievement during his tenure was the drafting of the "Agricultural Adjustment Act," but this act was ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court in 1935. Wallace revised it and eventually passed it.</p>
<p>In June 1940, he was nominated as the Democratic candidate for Vice President. In November of the same year, he and Roosevelt were elected as President and Vice President.</p>
<p>In 1944, he participated in the election again but lost. In the spring of the same year, he was ordered to serve as Secretary of Commerce, until today. He is a very interesting character.</p>
