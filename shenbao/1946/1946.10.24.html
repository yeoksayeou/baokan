<p>〔本報南京二十三日電〕和談進行中，第三方面因有感於刺激性宣傅有礙商談進展，故於昨晚會談中決定建議宣傅休戰，經雙方同意，並於記者會中公佈，盼記者協助鄭重記載和談消息，以有助於商談之進行。二十三日上午九時，民盟在保泰街張君勱寓邸集會，討論對調處之意見，十一時始畢。下午一時政府代表孫科，邵力子，吳鼎昌，陳布雷，陳立夫，吳鐵城，王世杰，張厲生，彭學沛等在勵志社聚餐，研討一切；並推定孫科，王世杰，於下午六時半再與第三方面交換意見。下午三時，第三方面全體在交行舉行會議，對和談各項間題，均詳加研討，至下午六時半始畢。晚餐後，於下午七時赴孫科寓邸，與孫科，王世杰，彭學沛，雷震等，就宣傳休戰實施問題予以研究，並推定邵力子，彭學沛爲政府方面代表，梁漱凕，李璜爲第三方面代表，定二十四日上午十時，由第三方面人士再訪共黨，請其推派代表，進行商討。似此宣傳休戰辦法，可能即予擬定實施。又在宣傳休戰之呼聲中，中共代表國今已掛出免戰牌，發言人梅益於傅達室留條僅書：「今日無新聞。梅益」七字。政府方面亦對新聞記者嚴密保留不發表談話，實已爲宣傳休戰之先聲矣。又聞各黨派代表蒞京已三日，就三日情形觀之，實已較過去好轉，若干問題之細節問題，已在硏究中，對於就現地停戰一事，第三方面早已聲明同意，只要共黨不再堅持成見，停戰令之頒發極有希望。又李璜上午十時自滬返抵京，據李稱，一切問題在進展中，較在滬時樂觀得多。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕偽上海市政府秘書長羅逆君强，廿三日午後在首都高等法院受審。羅逆以其鎮靜之神態，伶俐之口齒，於四小時內嘵嘵狡辯，且時作輕鬆愉快之奸笑，並以近視鏡後之金魚眼睛左顧右盼，十足一小丑式之巨奸。下午一時半，羅逆自老虎橋看守所提抵法院，二時三十五分，審判官駱允協，葛召棟，李懷安，檢察官王文俊，書記官陳希平，辯護律師王善祥，薛誦齊，（另王恒頣未到）等相偕升堂。首提尤逆乙照，宣判處徒刑七年，財產沒收。還押後，二時三刻，羅逆提到法庭，衣新藍布長袍，黃皮鞋，御黃邊眼鏡，立於被告席上，由駱庭長主審，羅逆代詞略謂：「羅君强，四十五歲，湖南湘鄉人，曾在上海大夏。大同樓校讀書，均未畢業，家中僅有一妻一子，財產在滬部分僅傢俱等物，已冊交軍統局，京市曾有一住宅，廿六年燬於戰火，該房屋及地皮曾向銀行抵押借款，至今尚未清償，（同時呈上銀行收條一紙）民國十五年，初入社會，在總司令部下一單位作一小事情，民國廿五年至廿七年任行政院秘書，廿七年十二月因人事關係去職，擬在海外從事文化工作（如報館等）。後因病先後滯居昆·港·遇周佛海，即以私人關係，應邀幫忙，廿八年八月抵滬，開始參加偽府，擔任偽官，直至三十四年一月十五日抵滬，除格就任偽上海市府秘書長，乃得當局許可，幫同周佛海作策反工作。」</p>
<p>參加偽組織　謂係周逆拖落水</p>
<p>羅逆對參加「和運」，堅稱：係坻港遇周後開始，對梅（思平）高（宗武）汪（兆銘）周（佛海）之預謀一概不知，當偽官後，衡諸個人的教養歷史，自始那認已鑄大錯，今在代表國家之法庭前，坦白講良心，自譴實深，但知錯後，又想急流引退，或縱身早死，則無意義，既入虎穴，必得虎子，乃決心作點事，以報國家領袖。</p>
<p>羅閘述其與周佛海之關係稱：「周作教授時，我是學生，我有一堂叔是周的至友，我作事一直在周嚴下，由科員而秘書長，而秘書，因爲我是比他差一輩低一等的，別人不明白，以爲我和周關係深，他的事我一定知道，並且參與，其實他要我做，我才做，不要我管，我也不能搶着管，我太重感情了，爲了幫他作事，攪稅警團，把頭髮她攪白了，半條命也攪掉了。」</p>
<p>辦了稅警團　竟然大表其「功」</p>
<p>羅逆對辦稅警團之「功」，一表再表，謂該支武力，係五年間費盡曲折，自敵偽各方摩擦之夾縫中建立，以圖「報國」者。「自二十九年起開始辦稅警學校，培養一種特殊的精神教育，一種特殊的任務，辦稅警時沒有一個兵，一桿槍，作到兩萬多人一萬多槍，還有相當數目種類的重武器，在敵人猜忌下保存至勝利，全部交與中央，不敢稱功」。</p>
<p>羅逆叙其「犯罪立功」之經過時，更爲興奮，謂：自二十八年任職偽府起，即覷隙效忠中央，並非後來看風色而轉移，三十一年與程克祥發生聯繋，三十三年與張叔平發生聯繋，三十四在滬如何聯絡日人反應分子，向岡村寗次主張撤退派遣軍，如何營救李明揚將軍，及其十餘部下，及如何組織「建國社」聯絡「同志」，進行策反工作等，不一而足。</p>
<p>毒殺李士羣　述經過眉飛色舞</p>
<p>旋王祖祥律師並請庭上訊問奉中央命令，剷除偽特工首領「七十六號」魔王李逆士羣之事實。羅逆更用力描述，眉飛色舞，如說書然。羅逆稱：「此事係卅三年初夏，自程克祥處得中央命令後，即與周佛海會商進行，余即與熊劍東合作，設想各種可能剷除李士羣之方法，甚至曾微行勘查行動必需之地形，然均覺不安，終於決定自離間其與日人之關係着手，以期借刀殺人，余即在某次稅警學校紀念週上，先放一砲，對李大加攻擊，同時由熊劍東在日人方面做工作，歷三四月之醞釀，至八月底時機成熟，九月三日晚，熊語余謂：『成了！』乃於次日，由日本高級特工岡村中佐出面，在其寓中請客，藉杯酒　嫌之方式，設宴請李熊，爲避免其黃色汽車之引人注意，乃乘余之黑色汽車前往，李最後到，岡村介紹其佯稱種新自日本來滬之非正式夫人後，並稱，由伊司廚，但李刁甚，仍滴酒不飲，但終以該女工作員及熊妻之機警，妥爲設計。置毒藥於冰淇淋及冰咖啡中，使李服下該種毒藥，係以鉅金自日陸戰隊購得，色味俱無，惟必須用於冷飲中，入腹後，雖洗腸亦不能治，數日後必將畢命。聞李於宴後，對席間各人過分友好態度大爲懷疑，以指挖喉，盡嘔合物，然以毒性極烈，終於八日畢命。事後，汪對余由疑而恨，若非其去東京醫病，稅警團必不能保。」羅逆叙述此項內幕新聞時，眉飛色舞，指手劃脚，一室旁聽者莫不爲其繪影繪聲之患者及陰狼毒辣之作風而動容良久。</p>
<p>後傳訊證人張叔平（前三戰區京滬聯絡專員，此次係奉陸總命令出庭作證）。及滿逆其蓆（偽滬市警務處長，現押京寗海路看守所）。分別對周羅與三戰區之特工聯絡，及「建國社」之內情，加以說明。末由辯護律師王善祥聲請注意調查證據，並提出李明揚，蔣伯誠，吳紹澍，李品仙，顧祝同，戴笠諸氏證明文件，呈交庭上。至五時半，書記官宣讀庭上筆錄，六時正審判長宣告初審完畢，定期更審，被告還押。羅逆乃踽踽解歸囚籠。</p>
<p>陳逆君慧再審</p>
<p>律師提出有利證據　下次開放開始辯論</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕陳逆君慧廿三日上午九時半在首都高院再度受鞠。陳逆衣襟皺折，頭髮蓬亂，形容極爲狼狽。由推事是雨蒼，書記官許昌升登堂，略加訊問，辯護律師吳傳頣提出有利證據五件，繼即傳訊證人汪鳴玉，會濤聲，林溪聲，劉君瑞等分別陳述陳逆在偽實業部長任內，向日人交涉保障小型紗廠及發還絲廠機器，與在偽僑委會委長任內發給僑用貸金等事後，庭上宣佈既無其他證據，下次將開庭辯論，不得再藉口拖延。至十一時半閉庭，被告還押。按陳案遷延已久，高院本擬廿三日審結此案，以陳逆刁鑽，乃又改長偵查庭。</p>

<p>〔中央社記者王萬鈞廿三日吉林電〕經敵偽八年苦心經營，尚未全部完工，其規模堪稱亞洲最大之松花江發電廠（即小豐滿），原具有七萬「千伏安」發電量之同期轉磁渦輪及電機八座，其豐水期之最高出電力，爲每日五十六萬「瓩時」年可發電廿四億「瓩時」，經濟部於本年六月十一日接收該廠時，蘇早已拆去發電機六座，餘存兩座，經整理後發電，由容量七萬「千伏安」單位之變壓器三座，以十五萬四千伏特之電壓，輸送電力，供長吉瀋及撫順等各大城鎮工廠之用，接收四閱月中，最高發電力曾達每日十萬「瓩時」現以往北至哈爾濱綫路不通，每日僅發電四萬「瓩時」。長春市記者訪問團，本日前往參觀時，睹此松花江上鉅大之水電工程，深覺有將該廠設備詳細介紹於國人之必要，蓋此乃吾人今後開發東北一切富源之原動力也。該廠位於吉林市北松花江上游廿四公里之豐滿鎮，具有面積五百五十平方公里，深七四米之蓄水池，及長一千一百米，高九一米，較計劃中之揚域安（Y.V.A）水閘爲長之大水堤，除有八萬五千瓩之渦輪機二座，及三千瓩者二座外，尚有七萬「千伏安」發電量之同期轉磁渦輪發電機八座，及七萬「千伏安」單位之變壓器五座，現餘三座，共分松長（豐滿至長春，四平西安），松撫（豐滿至撫順），松哈（豐滿至哈爾濱），松化（豐滿至吉林）等四幹綫輸電東北重要城鎮，工業地區所用電力，悉取給於此。據經濟部派往接收該廠專員申俊稱，蘇車除拆除發電機六座外，並運走該廠營造工具約百分之四十及電器材料百分之八十强，損失至爲鉅大，即以被拆去之發電機六座而論，即值東北流通劵四百五十六億元（每座價七十六億），至於欄河壩工程，全部混凝土量爲一百九十二萬立方米，現已完成一百七十二萬立方米，蓋蓄水池水位最高爲二百六十二米，現發遇部分壩身之高爲二百五十九米，尚有廿萬立方米混凝土量必須於今年搶先完成，否則來春冰凍融解，洪水越壩，吉省沿江十餘縣即有被淹沒危險。該廠自十月一日起，改由資委會接辦，前資委會派全國水力發電工程總處總工程德卡順（美籍）來此視察時，渠意豐滿發電廠今後應再恢復發電機一座，因勝利前每日發電約十九萬千瓦三座，可發電廿一萬千瓦也。該廠更有員工一千七百人，現有一千三百人，內有留用日籍技術人員三百五十人已遣走日籍員工眷屬共八百八十一人。</p>

<p>〔本報南昌廿二日電〕戰後江西工礦事業，日趨衰落，省府與四聯合資之興業公司所轄各工廠，如南昌·吉安·贛縣等縣電廠，因各廠機器多屬舊品，不堪負荷，故電力不足，吉安電光不若油燈，羣以汽燈代替，而贛縣電力雖較佳，然電費高出南昌三分之一强，其餘如酒精·漂染·紡織等廠，均已停工，一蹶不振。據熟悉內情者稱：贛省戰時輕工業能略形發展，乃利用中央收購錫礦之款週轉旋因戰時搬遷與日寇由贛撤退時之流竄，均被破壞，現以資金貧乏，工資昂貴，迄無復工可能。民營工廠亦皆紛紛倒閉，贛南大廈之鎢礦，現亦在冬眠狀態，資委會特種礦產管處，在該地開採之工人，僅百餘人，每日產量一市担左右，但土人向該處登記自由開採，每日約產百市担，收價每噸一百八十萬元，此種開採工程，全係土法，礦工生活已非昔比，美籍專家三人，刻正在該地考察設計新法開採。此外，尚有礦質平凡之子河煤礦，現亦有手工開採，每日產量約三噸，現存煤斤三萬餘噸，因水淺灘多，運輸困難。豐城煤礦係屬民營，由十餘公司所辦，礦質甚佳，日產約三百噸，但礦山交通不便，成本過高，影響各礦生產與南昌目前之煤荒。</p>

<p>中央研究院二屆三次評議會，於二十一日召開於首都，一時負有國際聲譽之學人畢集。我主席關懷學術研究之推進，特頒訓示，有所勗勉。同時，教育部長朱家驊，亦於其開幕詞中，宣布了國防最高委員會最近的決議，即科學研究費，在國家總預算內，應占的百分比，使此後我國學術研究，能够有較穩固的基礎。在今日這種動盪的情勢下，而有這種最高學術會議的召開，的確令人感到欣慰。</p>
<p>我國向以文化古國崇尚學術自居，然而近三五十年來，我國在學術研究方面，雖不乏傑出的人才，然近年學術研究的空氣，却一般地低落，此中原因，自非單純。在科學方面，地質學家的故丁文江，及翁文灝，李世光諸氏，古生物學家的楊鍾健，數學家的華羅庚諸氏的成就，雖蜚聲國際，但就在地質學，古生物學，數學方面，近年一般研究空氣的低落，當爲不可否認的事實。至於人文科學方面，情形亦復相同；而其危機却更深刻。法儒伯希和對於漢學研究的成就，超邁前古，固不必說，即荷蘭英美方面的漢學研究，亦着實可觀。例如美國國會圖書館所輯印之清代名人傳略，其規模之宏博，與其取材之謹嚴，能不令人讚佩。反觀我國，對質於自身的文化歷史之研究却轉趨銷沈，實在令人隱憂。我們願由於此次最高學術評議會的召開，能够提高我國學術研究的空氣和情緒。</p>
<p>中央研究院是我國最高的學術研究機關，論其組織，直隸於國府，其所處地位，固極崇高。它的西文名稱爲AcademiaSinica驟視之，似與法蘭西學士院相似；然中央研究院所負的使命，却與法蘭西學士院不盡相同。在主席對中央研究院所致的訓示裏，曾有這樣的昭示：『中正常以「無科學即無國防」之義，曉示國人，鑒於此次世界大戰勝負之原因，益可證明科學研究之重要，該院既爲首都唯一之學術研究機關，評議會更共負促進國內外學術研究合作互助之使命，今後如何加强我國學術研究工作，尤其對於國際科學上最近之發明，應如何努力探討，以期迎頭趕上，與先進各國並駕齊驅，均有循於都君之一貫努力，急起直追…。』可知中央研究院之使命在促進學術研究之外，還庽有固我國防之意。美國在戰時曾動員全國科學家致力於科學之研究，並在聯邦政府之下，成立專門從事於科學研究之機構。今戰爭雖告終止，而此項科學研究組織依舊存在。中央研究院，在自然科學部分，似乎至少應担負起相同的任務。</p>
<p>在目前研究空氣低落的情勢下，有兩種似是而非的論調，似乎應該亟需加以糾正。第一若干人士過注重於應用科學，而忽視了純粹科學的重要，在他們的眼裏，以爲只要研究應用科學好了，不必看重純粹科學。殊不知倘使沒有純粹科學的研究，那裏能够有科學的應用？二十年前，倘使沒有劍橋大學那些純粹物理學的研究，原子時代的出現，怕不會這麼早，至少要遲上許多年。所以我們應該將側重應用科學這種錯誤觀念糾正過來。第二，若干人士以爲科學研究，應不問目的，而只爲了科學而研究，若使科學研究而具有科學以外的目的，如爲了國防之類，不免引起一種反感彷彿自己失去身價似的。這也是一種錯誤的觀念。蘇聯的科學家不必說，就是英美等國的科學家，他們的科學研究，不也與國防的需要發生密切的聯系。今日的科學家已經不能在獨自關在實驗室裏，在象牙之塔裏做他的好夢了。</p>
<p>我們此地更應該特別提出，就是與國防需要無直接關係的科學研究，包括人文科學的研究，斷不能因與國防需要無直接關係，而予以偏廢。致力於「北京人」及中國古人類研究的新生代研究所，聞竟因經費的不裕而遭到停頓，望重世界的我國古生物家裴文中氏，亦竟賦置閑散。我們爲中國的人才可惜。至於其它在學術上盡了極大的努力，自甘寂寞，而掙扎於饑餓綫上，終致貧病以死的，如故馮承鈞先生那樣，實在值得我們的讚佩與同情。如今中央研究院評議會召開於南京，我們要籲請他們注意到如何珍惜人才，來推進我國的學術研究，以奠定建國之學術的基礎。</p>

<p>國際間根據正義之和平，將使全世界提早脫離戰爭所造成之痛苦，改善生活之條件，舉世人士均迫切希望公正持久之和平，故必須儘早使之實現。杜魯門總統認爲一切重大問題，可由善意與努力加以解決，職是之故，當前各國最重大之兩種種責任，乃在成立對原子能之管，以及取消其他足以引起集體屠殺之武器。總統復稱：盟國間持久性之協定，不能由一國强使其他國家接受，此種協定必須根據各有關國家之合法權益而獲致之。渠承認盟國之間確有異議存在，但吾人不必將此種異議誇張。並謂：「依余觀之，並無異議不能根據聯合國盡章之原則解決者」。論及德日兩國時，總統宣稱：此兩國家必須永久解除武裝，軍閥必須永久予以消滅。總統在其演說中僅提及三國小即美國，德國與日本，但以其內容觀之，顯然對於蘇聯與西方國家之關係極爲重視。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿二日電〕下院今日展開外交政策全面辯論，會塲人滿爲患。首由貝文外相發表演說，檢討世界一般局勢，呼召各大國採取新互讓主義，並謂各種和平問題之諒解，並非無望。貝文警吿英國將堅持波茨坦協定對德條款，若不完全遵守，即當完全重訂。外國干涉希臘務須終止，對於韃靼海峽之國際談判，有停止神經戰之必要。貝文並稱，吾人如欲在紐約各種會議中完成永久和平與經濟復興，務須準備承認他國之合法利益，而以公益爲重，自國利益爲輕。英國決心促成各國之諒解，此事若不能成就，常非英政府之過。</p>

<p>〔本報東京特派員廿三日電〕當此勞動界十月攻勢漸吿尾聲之際，左派份子之活動目標逐漸自都市轉向農村。於長野及北陸地方已有一部份農民拒絕向政府繳納食米。在共黨及社會黨各地支部領導下之東北各地農民組合，農會及農業會，亦有響應此種運動之趨勢。據稱：拒絕向政府交納食米之理由，係因（一）政府曾屢次聲明配給農具及肥料，以交換所繳納之食米，惟成績仍甚不佳，（二）受各產業勞動組合會議之罷工攻勢刺激，農民間表示聲援之聲逐漸抬頭，（三）共黨對目前政府之繳納食米辦法，早已表示反對，社會黨對政府發動强權迫令農民繳納食米之舉，亦不表趣意。因之，在該兩黨領導下之各農民組合支部，活動日益加强。換言之，農村中對即將發生之農業恐慌，已漸感不安·交換食米之配給物資，政府迄無力履行。更加以目前勞動者罷工攻勢之澎湃，農民在此種不安情緒之下，極易在政治上爲左派份子所利用，自不待言。全國各地擁有百萬會負之日本晨民組合，對此種情勢頗爲重視；於議會閉幕後，即派員分赴各地視察，俟各項報吿到齊後，即將表示態度。按日本農民組合原創立於大正十一年（一九二二年）由基督敎徒賀川豐彥及底山元治郞等所發起。昭和十二年中日戰爭勃發時，該會幹部如加藤勘十及鈴木茂三郞等，因參加人民戰綫被捕，致領導乏人，該會乃自動宣吿解散，其後由平野力三·野溝勝（現均屬社會黨）另組農民改革同盟，但不久爲東條迫令解散。迄本年二月九日，日本農民組合乃正式宣吿成立。對該會活動，共黨與社會黨意見十分紛歧。共黨前曾視日本農民組合爲反動團體，復經共黨代表野坂參一一一及伊藤律與該會幹部交涉結果，雙方意見乃漸見接近。現在靑森·梔木·石川愛知·岡山·廣島·佐賀各縣，兩黨係採取共同戰綫之立塲；其他各縣內兩黨依然對峙。該會現有會員百萬人，其中百分之七十擁護社會黨，百分之三十屬於共產黨，自由黨及進步黨之勢力範圍·該會會長須永好於義會演說時　卒，現由總幹事野溝勝代理，常務委員除黑田壽田外，多爲社會黨右派份十，如大西俊夫·岡田宗司·平野少三·中村高一·松守義雄等。日本農民組合有如社會黨所領導之勞動總同盟，幹部多屬社會黨份子。對此次反對繳納食米運動，恐仍專採取否定之態度，蓋勞動總同盟前曾對此次政治性之同盟罷工表示反對也。</p>

<p>— （本報譯自密勒氏評論報）</p>
<p>密勒氏評論報主筆小鮑威爾氏，近在該刋撰文報導日本之戰後經濟狀况稱：當中國目前正遭遇工業上及對外貿易上種種困難問題之時，觀察日本在該方面之長足發展，實爲頗饒興趣之事。　中國已恢復其大部份完整之工業區域，然仍輾轉於經濟停滯之泥途中，且迅將達到耗盡所有外國借款之一日。另一方面，日本之工業區域在戰時受損慘重，然現正迅速重建其國民經濟，數年之內，滅可恢復在亞洲之經濟領導地位。</p>
<p>在麥帥總部專家指示之下，日本已預定各項生產數額，且望可以完成。若干工業部門之復活，主要係賴麥帥之促進，因麥帥欲便日本獲得一堅固之經濟　礎俾可儘速應付賠款及佔領費用。此種政策雖爲若干熟憶日本以往目鄕村封建主義，迅速發展成現代化工業主義過程之人士深感不安，但總部方面則認爲監視甚嚴，且所恢復者係非軍事性之工業。總部之官員更指出直接與戰爭有關之工業已予摧毁，其他各種可以改裝爲戰爭工業者，亦已分別拆卸，運往各戰勝國抵作賠款。</p>
<p>此項論調似乎頗爲確切，但事實上所剩留之工業，已足够使日本在過去一年中，在對外貿易上「獲利」。按自戰事結束起，至本年八月底止，日本於貿易上贏餘五一·七〇二·〇〇〇日元，約合三·四五二·八〇〇美元。一年內輸出者爲生絲·錫·鉛·茶·硬橡皮·鎢砂等，總値一·五二五·九一六·（〇〇〇日元，輸入爲原棉及食物等，總値一·四七四·一二四·〇〇〇日元。</p>
<p>所有麥帥總部經濟計劃中最完備，而對中國最有關者爲棉紡計劃。此項計劃如於今後數年中果能完成，則全亞洲人民重御「日本製造」衣料之一日，爲期不遠矣。</p>
<p>日本原有紡錠一千二百萬錠，戰後雖僅剩餘二百萬餘錠，然棉紗及衣料之產量每月均在增加。現時原棉係向有餘之美國及印度輸入，在美國已訂購八十九萬包（每包五百磅），印棉則有三十萬包可於明年初運到。戰事結束之時，日本尙存有原棉及半製棉頗多，己製成衣抖十萬萬方碼。</p>
<p>依照麥師總部之計劃，明年初起日本即可有逐漸增加之生產剩餘，最後生產額中，將可有百分之五十之輸出、運銷菲律賓·緬甸·馬來亞·印度，甚至中國·此項棉紗之輸出，可換取外滙，用以購買食物及償付佔領費用。</p>
<p>總部對於恢復日本之絲織工業更具野心。蓋棉紡計劃目標僅在恢復戰前亞洲市塲，而絲織計劃則目標在乎獨佔世界。戰後世界對絲織之需要，由於人造絲及「尼龍」之日益改進而大爲减少，估計每年約三千萬磅左右，而日本之初步目標計劃於一九五一年完成者，即達三千五百萬磅之多。</p>
<p>最近宋院長與麥帥總部絲業顧問麥加納問之齟齬，已極明顯指出麥師總部對中國之態度。麥加納指控宋院長領導之組織意在接收日本之絲業經濟；但東京非官方觀察家則認爲此事實爲「天下烏鴉一般黑」，易言之，有不少人物均熱中於接收日本之絲業。</p>
<p>不論宋氏與馬加納間引起如何之糾紛，麥帥總部仍願扶助日本絲業之復興，以達到能滿足全世界需要之程度，而使日本熊作爲外滙收入之主要來滬。總部認爲如將影響日本絲業，則將不予中國絲業以任何帮助。所謂影響·不論爲使日本缺少原料設備，或使中國在世界生絲市塲上足與日本競爭。</p>
<p>本埠若干報紙雖於週前發佈兩次「面子」新聞，謂雖有麥加納之指責，日本仍將運一千萬磅絲繭來華，但事實上除非麥帥下令爲「面子」關係而以少量運華，否則希望甚少。蓋數月前中國駐日代表團朱世明將軍請求運華絲繭一千萬磅已遭拒絕，後减至四百萬磅；仍未邀准，其原因在於至十一月中，日本本身亦將遭到絲繭之短缺。</p>
<p>麥帥總部官員中，私人力面更有認爲中國政府之目的僅在阻止日本使用絲繭，因中國本身不能善於利用。彼等更謂，據接得之報吿稱，中國方面對麥帥贈與中國人民之案籽使用不當。此類種子係桑叢之籽，品質較桑樹之籽爲佳，原意分配與受戰事破壞區域之種植者，但事實上中國政府竟在黑市出售，且定價高昂，致有不少在脫手以前即已萎枯腐爛矣。</p>
<p>歷史上之中日經濟敵對狀態，似乎又在蘊釀中，而日本則有重佔上風之勢，因日本在嚴密組織上之效率及能力，並未因戰爭失敗而有顯著减退。此外，日本並獲佔領當局在原料及技術顧問上之大量援助，而中國則在過去半世紀中、在工業化上雖已有長足之進步，但目前則其大部精力又在消耗於內爭之中。</p>
<p>總之，麥帥總部已在從事使日本成爲亞洲政治上及經濟上之强國，而以過去一年之成績視之，似已有一極好之開端矣</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿二日電〕聯合國大會廿三日將在此間開幕，那時候紙約將一躍而爲世界的國都。紐約市內本來已經擁擠不堪，驟然增加五千多位來賓，住宿大成問題。大會招待員們奔走全城，在各大旅館與較小的公寓中，爲各國代表找尋下榻處，忙得滿頭大汗，好容易佈置完畢。各旅館休息室中，因爲言語不通，引起小小騷動。旅館外面停着許多招待來賓的車輛，代表們在開始艱巨的工作以前，要領略一番紐約夜生活的滋味。街頭到處可見橫旗寫着「擁護我們的聯合國」口號，許多商店用全體聯合國國旗作爲裝飾，洋囡囡穿了各國的服裝，並有聯合國郵票陳列。多數出口洋行陳列巨幅地圖，表明他們全世界主顧客的所在。國旗招展的洛克斐勒廣塲，舉行露天音樂會與舞蹈表演，各街道滿見插着聯合國趺子兜風的出差汽車。警察局已出動後備隊，協助維持交通，並在會塲服務。</p>

<p>自第二次世界大戰結束後，被譽爲東方名城之上海，又重爲遠東交通之樞紐。外國航空公司，爭相在滬開設立航錢。現在上海之航空公司，除中國航空公司與中央航空公司外，尙有菲律濱航空公司（由美商與菲政府合辦，中國旅行社與衛利韓公司代理），泛美世界航空公司，（由中國航空公司代表，中國旅行社協助），及遠東航空公司，（正大公司代理）。以前尙有太平洋航空公司，今已取消。美軍駐滬時，美軍機往來至爲頻繁，今因美軍離滬他調，軍機往來稍見减少。現泛美世界航空公司已準備增闢遠東航綫，將於十一月廿一日派機飛越遠東十大城市，作二萬四千里長征，視察開闢遠東航空錢之可能性。其路途以檀香山爲起點，依次至中途島，威克島，關島，東京，上海，廣州，加爾各答，仰光，盤谷，西貢，新加坡，巴達維亞，馬尼刺，回舊金山。若此遠東航綫開辦，則以上各城市之交通，當較前更見便利。即以日本一地而言，現在到日本之飛機，除軍機外，尙無民航機。而飛往暹羅一帶，則必須經由香港，頗多週折。但此遠東航綫之成立，必須取得我交通部之準航權，或由我方代理。蓋我國自不平等條約取消後，領海航空各權已收回，外人如欲在中國經營航空公司，必須依照以上之條件。故泛美公司之遠東航綫若成立，將由中國航空公司代理。現在上海可供應用之機塲，龍華機塲由中央與中航合管，跑道長度不足，巨型之運輸機仍須在江灣機塲降落。據悉：龍華機塲之跑道，可能重修。將來若機塲不敷應用時，可能將虹橋機塲亦重修應用。泛美公司之航綫係由滬經馬尼剌·關島·中途島·威克島·檀香山至舊金山。自滬至馬尼刺之旅費，爲美金二百廿五元。至檀香山爲七百卅元。至舊金山爲九百廿二元。每人准帶行李五十五磅。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕最近在常熟當地開庭調査敵憲米村春喜罪行之軍事法庭陸起法官等一行四人已於前日公畢晚車返滬。</p>
<p>陸法官昨在其辦公室中接見記者稱：此行收獲甚多，當地及附近鄕民之曾遭敵憲荼毒者聞悉開庭之消息後，均紛紛提狀檢舉，被害人之家屬更多遠道前來出庭，其中有白髮衰翁，有披孝少婦，均在庭上痛哭陳訴，要求伸寃。</p>
<p>此次最重要之新發現係前在憲兵隊內担任翻譯之陸某，此人於勝利後即遭當局逮捕，最初判處死刑，後改爲無期徒刑，現囚禁於蘇州高院監獄內。根據此人之口供，獲得兩點重要綫索：（一）當初米村所以大興寃獄，目的在於邀功晉級，因米村雖爲憲兵隊長，其職位僅爲少尉，屢望升遷，當時適値淸鄕淸城時期，遂由某一翻譯獻計，何不迎合上峯心理，逮捕地下工作人員，（此翻譯於戰事結束時自知罪大惡極，向米村哭訴求助，經米村資助金錢並以二百萬元僞鈔買汽車一輛助其逃逸無蹤）米村遂先未雨綢繆，將隊部隔壁楊姓房屋拆卸後改建爲監獄四座，然後密囑該翻譯與野口軍曹設法與地方人士接近刺探，濫施捕捉而誣以預定之罪名。（二）被害人中除一部份係被送往上海十三軍軍律會議處死外，尙餘五人據米村供稱係送往當時縣立醫院，但據陸翻譯稱：彼曾目睹其中之聞星五刑斃於憲兵隊監獄中，彼並曾往隊部對門雜貨店中購取長錠香燭等物燒化，且因付款問題與雜貨店發生爭吵。聞星五死後由米村囑當時縣立醫院院長金紹周出具證書，證明病死後呈報了事。憲兵隊中類此之情形不可計數云。</p>
<p>活埋屍體·百具以上</p>
<p>陸法官等此次並赴現爲傘兵部隊駐紮地之前敵憲兵隊隊址中搜索證據，在該處枯井中發現草蓆破鞋等物，至於北門外荒地中被活埋之屍體則掘不勝掘，估計在百具以上。</p>
<p>該處主任書記官前次所訪問與先立醫院有關之醫師事務員等，此次亦經傳訊，供述仍與前相同，所能證明之一點僅爲當時縣立醫院中所收憲兵隊送來之病人，不論治愈或死亡，均仍交由憲兵隊領回或埋葬。</p>
<p>米村案經軍事法庭兩次派員實地調査之後，證據已相當充份，不日即將開庭再審，惡魔定獻之期爲日不遠矣。</p>

<p>物資供應局接收吉普車百輛</p>
<p>五十輛售與國府餘將供給民用武器載運車五百輛不日可到滬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院物資供應局，昨日收到美國外剩餘物資淸理委員會，移交吉普車一百輛。供應局接得此批吉普車後，尙須加以修理，修竣後擬以五十輛送往南京供國民代表大會代表使用，用後則售與國民政府。其餘五十輛，則將售予民用，但如何分配，目前尙未能確定。現向該局申請購買吉普車者，已達三千數百輛之多。</p>
<p>物資供應局冲繩島儲整處接收之吉普車，爲數極少，且均係破爛不堪，蓋前冲繩島戰區，乃屬馬尼刺地區管轄，應屬麥克阿瑟元帥經管，勝利後麥帥部下軍官眷屬陸續赴日，故原存冲繩島完整吉普均經售空。</p>
<p>但該局不日將接獲冲繩島運來武器載運車五百輛，每輛售價美金二千二百元，申請者可向該局接洽並交付定洋一半。</p>
<p>借用船隻二艘載運沖繩物資</p>
<p>又據該局副局長兼沖繩島儲整處處長周自新談：該處接收物資中以起重機爲最多，的有一千架，同時尙有大宗碼頭器材。按當時美海軍在冲繩島登陸者六萬人，陸軍二萬人陸海美軍共達八萬人，其設備之週密可想而知是故其剩餘之物資亦極多。此項碼頭器材運滬後，對於卸運行總及供應局之物資，將有莫大之帮助。該局近與招商局洽妥，借用船隻二艘，暫作經常駛行，此批前往冲繩島技工二百餘人，定今日首途，尙有二百餘人，定月底前往，原船返滬時，將運來大批軍毯及築路器材等。以後預期每月可載運二萬噸，各種器材，一俟修竣，即可隨時運到。此外將有美軍船隻協助運輸。周副局長定下週一再度赴島。</p>

<p>郎靜山出國前舉行夫婦影書展</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕四十年來，始終爲攝影藝術而努力的中國第一流攝影專家郞靜山氏，不但在國內且在歐美各國，都有極高的聲譽，郞氏的作品展覽，早已博得不少愛好藝術人士的贊賞和仰慕，當然用不到記者的辭費。可是最近數年來，郎氏已很久沒有舉行影展。這次因爲應美國之請前往講學，同時被邀出席紐約航空攝影比賽爲評判委員，所以在出國之前作一次影畫展。</p>
<p>這次郞氏影畫展在大新公司二樓舉行，自二十日至二十六日，除了郞氏歷年攝影傑作一百三十六幀外。尙有郞夫人雷佩芝女士的人物畫，郞氏夫紂合昨的國畫多幀，都是非常精彩美妙。</p>
<p>郞氏的集錦照相，尤爲他的精心獨持之表現，這種照片，可以補單張照片之缺點而集各影之精華以成一最美麗完善之作品，但集錦的成功與否，全靠經騐和精細的技巧，稍有欠缺，那成爲弄巧成拙，而郞氏的每幅作品。却都如天然妙造的圖畫一般，天衣無縫，找不出一綫弊病，這的確不是一旦一夕所能硏究成功的影展中如「巫山落日」，如詩如畫，曾在英國展覽，得英皇家攝影獎，又如「層巒疊嶂」，莊嚴雄偉，也曾在英國攝影年鑑刋登，此外如「虎嘯」，「莫干亭竹」等許多作品，都是中國攝影壇上不可多得的名作。</p>
<p>郞氏不僅是我國攝影界的前輩，而且還是報館有攝影記者之名的第一人。當郞氏十四歲時，即開始拿了一隻方盒鏡箱照相，用自製的藍晒紙晒照片。民國元年入申報館服務，常和畫家沈泊塵，丁悚二位在一起。有一次郞氏在哈同花園橋畔照得楊柳照片一幀，丁悚看了，很爲欣賞，即將這照片送交時報畫刋登載。其後時報爲舉辦遠東運動會特刋，須特派專人柏照，於是郞氏在主持人黃伯惠商請之下，即担任了攝影記者，盛名亦即留傳至今。</p>
<p>郞氏此番出國，並將往羅馬聖城，攝取宗敎建築及歷史古蹟。歸國後必有更多名貴佳作問世。</p>

<h3 id="c97">上海扒窃黨的黑幕（四） <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>利器小試衣袋割破</p>
<p>「扒手」不是新興的勾當·在世界的每個大都市都有這一門。在上海—這一門進歡極厚的生意，是老早給「老弟兄帮」中的「扒竊黨」所包辦了。這是「扒竊黨」的第三種活動帮派，帮中人統稱爲「跑生意」，帮派又分爲二大門類，一門叫做「跑細老」，便是我們所知道的「三隻手」，另一門叫做「跑底子」，是專門在船埠活動的，這裏先叙述「跑細老」這一門。</p>
<p>「跑細老」是一種最有出息，同時又是最危險的勾當·一不小心，便當塲失風，下手人免不了先受失主和路人一頓毒打，然後又須入警局送牢獄，故非扒竊黨中的頭等角兒不能充任·所謂「玲瓏子舞耀」（切口詳前）最是需要，習此者又分爲三種選修專科，每種須費多年的攻苦，方能成「業」·計爲：甲種「剪綹」帮，乙種「跑行風」帮，丙種「落地扒」帮。</p>
<p>「剪綹」帮—這帮扒竊的目的物是錢袋及錶飾，下手時隨身攜帶一柄小刀或古錢，磨得十分銳利，專門割破人家的衣袋而施扒竊的。每次出動至少須有助手一人相伴，但表面上並不互相招呼，不過彼此眉目傳播信號而已。先叫助手向對象人身上一種，俟其人圓頭看時，立即乘機下手。有時認爲對象人士顧士　，不曾撞時已下手成功了。扒摥之後，下手人便秘密傅興助手，其儘先　開。如在電車中則先下手，即使失主　住扒　　威，却以事無佐證，但這時他所隨帶的小利器，早已丟開去了。</p>
<p>妙手空空慣施絕技</p>
<p>「跑行風」帮—乃是不帶任何利器，祗憑着妙手空空，摸竊人家錢袋金飾的。這一門乃是最難的功課，故非老手莫辦。</p>
<p>「落地扒」帮—此帮的目的物並不在錢袋，而在旅客的行李箱籠，所以他們的活動地段，乃是在車站和碼頭上。上海交通網水陸四佈，但秩序向來是雜亂無章，每個旅客總是在奔走紛亂中過生活，「老弟兄」袖手旁觀，以逸待勞，而且可以從容地擇肥而噬。一面利用同夥假問訊爲由，或與對手方找麻煩，使他的注意力分開了，便用最敏捷的手法搬走箱範包裹一二件。或是看準乘客坐黃包車來到，停車時又須給付車資，又須搬取雜物放在地上，扒竊黨便可以開始下手。總之，本帮的活動對象，是那些剛剛「落地」的東西，故名「落地扒」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕邇來外傳中央印鑄廠日夜開工，趕印鈔票，記者今日特走詢該廠高級職員，據云：此說與事實不符。該廠目前之工作，其一爲派員赴美，研究印鈔技術之改良。今日美國最精之印刷術，能於一方吋之面積上，印橫綫二百五十條，我國對此應倍加努一力。鈔票印刷精良後，旣可防止僞造，又可增加美觀。另一項工作爲承印財部直接稅局及其他機關之公文表格。此外則台幣相當缺乏，該廠奉令即製一部，，以供流通。中央印鑄廠共有兩廠，一在北平，一在上海，另有一規模甚小之印刷所。此三單位之生產力總和，與報紙所傳之龐大數量，相去甚遠。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紡織事業管理委員會吳主委，自於日前晋京請示返滬後，即於昨日下午三時，假市政府會議室，召開第二次紡管委員會。到副主委李升伯，委員束銀章，林鳳苞，楊鉍仁，王啓宇，唐星海，郭棣活，及該會業務處長劉文騰等。列席者有奚玉書·劉靖基·劉丕基·吳昆生·榮一星諸氏。會議至五時卅分始散。會議經過如次：（一）原棉問題：自吳主委請示宋院長後，宋院長已允恢復美棉結滙，並定就近實施。惟各廠購買美棉前，應先經紡管會核準。故各廠須迅向紡塡報目前之存棉數量，生產設備，及用棉數量。存棉數量不敷三月之用量者，即可申請購買。（二）配銷價格：經多時之熱辯；決定廿支標準紗配價爲一百七十五萬元。其他各支紗依此例增減。（三）首期配紗之總額，及其分攤辦法：首半月配紗總額定一萬二千〇〇四件半。此中紡建公司佔三分之一，計四千〇〇一件半。民營各廠佔三分之二，計八千〇〇三件。（四）配售對象及辦法：以機器染織毛巾被毯，針織，手帕，內衣，手工棉織等六種工業同業公會，爲優先本銷對象。配售辦法，將先由紡管會根據各同業公會所呈報之需要量，核定准配數量後，交由配銷委員會配售予各同業公會，再由各公會轉配與各會員工廠。（五）首期配紗一萬二千〇〇四件半，攤銷之各廠，應於明日將貨全部備齊，以便配銷。又據統計：一月配紗，不過二萬餘件，僅佔全市每月總產量百分之卅八。其剩餘之棉紗，准許各廠運銷外埠。（六）中央銀行亟望能扶助並發展我國之紡織工業。過去該行對遠期之美棉結滙，曾給予五厘之低利貸款。今番如恢復美棉結滙，各廠購棉時如確需資金，該行仍將仿照舊例，予以低利貸款。（七）今後紡管會對棉紗之處理對策，將以合理之評價爲重心。蓋合理之評價，足以消滅棉紗黑市。黑市消滅後，棉紗之需要量，常不致如目前之龐大。（八）今後紡管會決定每週召開委員會一次。如値紗價波動時，將花會議巾從詳商討，以便決定適當之對策。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市先堅後回，晨初客帮略有問津，開盤特雙馬一度喊高至二百四十三四萬，藍鳳二百十九萬，然成交寥寥，收盤時，回降至二百四十萬，其餘廿支各牌，俱在始昂終疲之過程中，結果與前日大致無甚漲落，細紗及綫搜求有人，卅二支以上均漲起四五萬之譜，脚地仍極堅硬。　昨布市亦堅穩，雖走銷不旺，但價格仍站定，撲厥原由，實爲生產無多，存底又薄，尤以各廠因成本關係，不肯大量吐售，且聯合配紗定價，紗廠業頗感不敷成本，如欲求普遍配售定價合理，勢須重行調整不可，晨市藍鷄七萬七千五百元成交，喇叭實現貨喊七萬七千元，四君子嗶嘰九萬三千元，老貨喊九萬五千元。</p>
<p>陰丹士林顏料價，已接近三千萬元，一九〇號上光士林每疋成本，竟高達四萬九千元，近日陰丹士林布走銷不多，價格亦尙穩定，如一旦客銷見旺，士林布價勢須上漲，可無疑義。</p>

<p>外幣較爲鬆濫，美鈔晨初暗市的四〇五〇元至四一〇〇元，午刻爲四〇七〇元至四一二〇元，門市官價仍不開展，以暗盤相較，較前收微絀，港票有供少求，但報價仍與前收相彷彿，港滙入八五元有售，印滙一〇七〇元有供，英滙一四一〇〇元至一四二〇〇元，美滙牌價未更，對做仍寂。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕江蘇省敎育廳應長陳石珍氏，於昨（廿三）日下午三時，假八仙橋靑年會招待本市新聞界，計到盧冠六·張一渠·徐蔚南·孫東城等十餘人，首由上中校長沈亦珍博士致介紹詞，略謂蘇教廳陳廳長日前特地趕來參加上中立校十九週年校慶紀念會，多所指示，非常榮幸，今日陳廳長乘來滬之便，招待新聞界，對蘇省敎育近况，有所報吿。在一片掌聲中。陳廳長即起立致詞，大意如下：此番來滬，能有機會與上海新聞界談江蘇省的敎育近况，是感到非常高興的。江蘇省的敎育，在過去向處全國領導地位，新教育，實自江蘇省開始。後抗戰期間，江蘇省幾乎全省淪陷，省政府到處流浪，形成無政府狀態。而敎育設施，從此摧毁殆盡，回憶過去輝煌之歷史，殊足痛心。本人（陳廳長自稱）自接任後，急欲恢復各敎育機關，然苦於經費無着，且破壞太烈，敎育廳竟片瓦無存，此外各地敎育機關及各附屬小學等，亦受嚴重摧殘，足證敵人對於敎育方面之破壞，爲其主要目的。本人就任之初，租鎭江之破旅館辦公，後幸得京滬衛戍總司令湯恩伯將軍之助，撥給一部分虜俘營，敎育得以繼續維持。當時只求有地方上課，不問是否有敎學之設備。只要有能避風雨之房屋，即席地上課，情形十分慘痛。</p>
<p>教育至上校舍第一</p>
<p>講到省敎育方面：省教育經費，現佔全省支出總數百分之三十。緊急復員經費，去年爲一億七千萬元，本年爲四億元。高等敎育機關，現有專科學校，及獨立學院各二所。中等敎育部門，有省立中學十四所，師範十三所，職校七所，省立實小及附小十五所，省立社敎機關八所，總計現有省立各校館六十一所。戰前爲七十九校館，已恢復百分之八十。惟因受戰事影響，校舍全部毀壞或大部分破壞者，在百分之五十以上，本人曾謂「敎育至上，校舍第一。」故校舍問題，目前仍極感困難，因陋就簡　勢所難免。今後敎育方針，業經決定，先從擴充省縣師範學校着手，因師資最關重要，，僅就蘇省第一年推行國民敎育計劃所需合格敎師，即在三萬人以上，故增設師範學校，刻不容緩，現已詳加計劃，付諸實施。繼師範敎育之後，再謀職業學校之擴充。至普通中學則注重內容之充實，除視需要酌增數校外，暫時不擬添設。。私立中學，數量過多，擬嚴加限制。現向廳呈請立案者有一百五十校，未呈請者尙有一百餘校，但已核准者僅四十八校。</p>
<p>江蘇教育從頭做起</p>
<p>云南於地方教育，自廿九年起，大後方已把小學校改爲國民學校，意思是說，凡屬國民，就必須受敎育。在戰事之前，小學生入學往往要受强迫，而戰事之後，是要讀書而不得其門而入。這種矛盾的現象，是表示國人已經覺悟到敎育的重要，而政府更應急謀校荒之解決。本來地方敎育，宜側重推行國民敎育，在戰後之江蘇，尤感迫切需要。本人覺得江蘇敎育，須從頭做起。現正按照預定五年計劃，逐步實施。本年度先完成每兩鄉鎭設一中心國民學校，每三保設一國民學校。第二年完成每鄕鎭設一中心國民學校，每三保設二國民學校。第三年完成每保設一國民學校之目標。第四年注重中心國民學校內容之充實。第五年注重敎學研究。希望依此步驟，能達到敎學及設備應有之最低限度標準。至於社敎部分，各縣社敎機關，已恢復六十餘所，今後擬積極推行失學成人識字敎育，掃除文盲，惟所需經費甚巨，現向中央請求撥助大量款項，以利進行，此外對於地方敎育行政機構，決逐漸恢復敎育局，擬在一二等縣份先行恢復。一面積極淸理各縣敎育款產，以裕收入。</p>
<p>蘇北校舍應用草屋</p>
<p>至蘇北各縣敎育，日前尚有二十餘縣因環境關係，未能完全復員，但在重要地區，如徐州等處，已設省立敎育機關十七所。現更進一步迅　蘇北敎育之推進，本年先恢復國民學校，因原有校舍破壞過多，祇得暫爲建築草屋應用，明年度開始後，陸續恢復原有省立中等學校。師資及敎科書均在準備中，並向行政院請撥復員經費，以應急需，此外，敎育上尙有二個値得注意的問題，即爲師資的缺乏，與學風的敗壞。八年戰期中，由於師資訓練的不注意，和敎師待遇的不合理，富有能力的教師，多先後改業。據本人調査結果，無錫一城中，合格之小學敎師僅佔十位！若這種現象任其繼續下去，中國敎育必將完全破產。</p>
<p>學風日壞最足焦慮</p>
<p>最足焦慮者，抗戰之後，學風日壞，甚至川省有學生打先生生的事情發生。學生之不尊敬敎師，即等於病人之不信仰醫生，其惡果可以預料。故在敎育復員聲中，整頓學風，實最關重要。希望敎育負責者及社會人士，羣策羣力，以求精神上之復員云云。最後陳廳長述及此次參加上中十九週校慶，盛讚該校設施，在萬分困難中，却有長足進展，引爲滿意。陳廳長演詞，於掌聲中結束後，即由孫東城及盧冠六等相繼發表意見。招待會至六時許始散。聞陳廳長定今日（二十四日）　省，並擬順道赴蘇，視察蘇州中學。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕天津華勝及洛陽征輪兩籃球隊昨晚之慈善賽，在極接近與緊張之情勢中，握手言和，四十七比四十七未分勝負，雙方同意，不再延長時間，上半時征輪以廿三比廿一佔先二分。昨晚觀衆約計千餘人，籃委會昨日初次試用電動售票機，效力非常敏捷準確，如無其他缺點，籃委會準備永久採用。</p>
<p>拍賣義球</p>
<p>半塲休息時間，舉行義球拍賣，首由華聯藥廠以一百萬元購得，該廠捐出再拍，由程伯庵君亦以一百萬元承購，程君亦慨捐再拍，終由百樂門飯店顧利康君亦以一百萬元購進，昨晚門票收入，當塲公布，計二百三十七萬四千元，全部收入撥充國際救濟醫院，南市平民醫院，保黎醫院，及同德醫學院施診給藥經費。</p>
<p>始終緊張</p>
<p>昨晚比賽，雙方相當和洽，形勢自始至終，無一分鐘不緊張，自華勝以八比三，十七比十四領前之後，征輪即躍居前茅，一路佔先，以一二分三四分領導，一再造成平手者，不知其次數，直至最後華勝幸賴王有才遠射中的，打成平手，鐘聲隨之大鳴，皆大歡喜，不再續賽。征輪表演確已大爲進步，頗具羣聲作風，惟昨日似乎過分小心，反見拘束，華勝總覺稍欠靈活，體力及速度皆不够應付也。</p>
<p>一球佔先</p>
<p>征輪蔡忠强首開紀錄，于瑞章罰球得點，華勝有才二中，金聲金銘學上加霜，赫然以八比三領前，征輪呼停密商，果然扳成七與八，金銘鴻斌有才，迭有所獲，一路領前，但十七對十四後，征輪文龍與瑞章二中，以十八對十七首度超出，華勝以尹煥文調出劉學錡，是後雙方均有所獲，前半結束，廿三比廿一征輪佔先。</p>
<p>不分勝負</p>
<p>兩陣再圓，征輪陳容略有調動，張根生入替王秉煥，接觸後，傳金聲籃下托入，忠强還以顏色，一來一往，各有命中，廿七比廿五征輪佔先兩分，迨鴻斌遠擲中的後，戰成拉鋸，學錡入補鴻斌，華勝仍未見好轉，兩方分數，此起彼落，戰情已白熱化，四十五比四十四時，韓文田入替劉學錡，時距終塲尙有一分半鐘，祭忠强遠擲中的，成四十七比四十五，然鐘聲響處，華勝王有才，球出破籃，四十七對四十七造成和局。</p>

<h3 id="c160">豫北五百里 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 十三日開封航訊　本報特派員邵愼之</p>
<p>十月十日，我自開封啟程到豫北去，記者感覺得這一帶的消息渾沌已久，有實地視察的必要。</p>
<p>豫北也是歷史上進行大厮殺的戰塲；歷史的北載十分嚇人，周武王會八百諸候於孟津，弔民伐罪，戰商紂於牧野，殺人無數，說是血流「漂杵」—連本棒都浮得起來。</p>
<p>牧野是在朝歌的郊外，朝歌的位置據考在今淇縣西北，淇水以北。這地方不是正是瀰漫着戰火嗎？這也正是中華民族有過燦爛的文化的地方。當全世界正龍罩於蒙昧的黑暗中，這裏的靑銅器文化却已閃閃發亮。</p>
<p>我現在啓程朝着我們的「聖地」去，不知所能看到的是些什麼景象，不免惶恐。聽說最近又有什麽古器在安陽出土，因此增强了我此行的慾望。</p>
<p>北渡沙河</p>
<p>北方的深秋，天朗氣爽，多少有些可愛之處。不過這是比較的說法。因爲開封的春天，空氣中充滿灰沙的細粒，結成濃厚的黃霧，五步不見人，太陽也失了光輝。比四川盆地的霧季惡劣萬倍。</p>
<p>直到目前爲止，「沙漠南移」　還不失爲一個値得硏究的專題。可是我們只要看一看現在的漳河兩岸，冀中平原以及所謂中原的黃　自磧，土地一大片一大片的荒蕪着，露出了本來面目，這些泥土離開了農作和水份的覊絆，便隨風飛舞起來·這些地方，不待沙漠南移，本身就要變成沙漠。黃霧飛騰，即該是天下大亂的時候。</p>
<p>開封城北，早被這些灰沙堆滿，甚至逼近城垜，進開封城不必經過城門，在沙坡上跑就是了。目前開封一度吃緊，於是動手來挖掘，眞是工程浩大，勞民喪財啊！</p>
<p>開封北二十五華里就是黃河，自廿七年黃河毁堤，奪道賈魯河之後，這裏竟滴水也不瀉過來，河底向天，已有八年，二十里寬的河，中間是一道沙河，但不是流沙，却是瀚海。一陣風過，捲起層層沙浪，彷彿置身塞外。無怪開封所受灰沙的威脅如此嚴重。然而我們的地圖上還是畫着一條藍色的綫。</p>
<p>不過花園口堵口工程完工之後，黃河還要走回一別八載的舊道。而現在則是自開封到新鄕的火車駛過黃河底的沙漠。這條路僅僅一百八十華里，民國卅年敵人拆了道淸鐵路束綫，用來接通平漢和隴海，不消架橋，祗把兩岸的堤挖開缺口，把鐵軌在河底舖過去。不久的將來，這條支路就會變成歷史的陳跡，現在我經過這河底，一點不錯，它竟和地面一樣高低。</p>
<p>禹治洪水（主要的是治黃河），共歷十三年，或說八年，但他能維持一千六百年（或說四百年）沒有水患，所以現在的中國人心目中禹王還是特別偉大，如果永遠特別偉大下去，中國的命運眞不可想像了。</p>
<p>新鄉透視</p>
<p>日本人曾經企圖創造一個奇蹟，把潛力頑强的中國社會納入它自己的系統，一舉而改變它素來不易改變的面目，在若干地方，就表面上看起來，它幾乎已經成功。新鄕也是一個例子。</p>
<p>一邊是舊城，讓中國人依然在裏面過着保守的生活，啣接着的另一邊是按照現代都市建設計劃，建立一個新的城市，居住着日本人。相形之下，舊城在灰沙中日見沈沒和殘破，而崛起的新城則在灰沙中燦然發亮。</p>
<p>不過短短的六七年時間，一個新城市的規模已經樹立起來，現在日本人跑開了，而這些東西仍然和舊城裏的人民沒有關係·它爲勝利的潮水所衝刷，軍隊過了一陣又一陣，房屋越弄越破，越破越弄，不久的將來，新鄕可以復原到抗戰以前的形態是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>就是現在，軍隊已經不得不泛濫到舊城去，那裏曾經爲人民小心翼翼地愛護着，一代一代做他們溫暖的窠塲。一個沒有電燈的城市，在黑暗中只有軍隊的呼喊和他們的行列蠕蠕而動，白天的灰沙烈日，使得秩序更形緊張：賣觸　的獨輪車，鐵截子架上插滿　繼做商標；掛着淸眞小牌子，下華紅布流蘇，這些賣生熟牛肉的獨輪車，也順着街道排成一溜，像出窠蜂似的蒼蠅，嘶破嗓子的叫賣聲。這種形態已經保持了幾千年了，而旁邊的店舖中，可憐的小樹窗裏，充滿着的是洋貨，它只是目光灼灼地窺視着那些在生活綫上掙扎的人羣。　我遇到一個油豐店的老闆，他在舊城的街上有一個小門面維持營業，幾乎全部較好的房子爲某集團軍的人力隊所佔，經過書面請求，他們的上級批准讓出門面，可是繼續而來的是另一批軍人，掛起「鴻翔公司」的招牌，陸續接替了人力隊所佔的全部房屋，製售和平的軋麵機，軋棉機和織布機，他們就是某集團軍的修械所。勝利以後，連自己的房子也沒份了。</p>
<p>這個故事眞像一顆多面的寳石，每一個側面都能吿訴我們一點東西。這樣的修械所，你知道在中國有多少？可是勝利一年以來，這位老闆却正懷着極大的苦悶，至於他照舊向政府付出房捐和地畝捐，却還是小事。</p>
<p>我所住的一個小旅館，新鄕算首屈一指，原曾由日本人經營過，一年後的今日，多少留下一點日本式佈置的遺跡，但是瓷磚砌的厠所已無法插足，房間裏牆壁霉剝，塗滿發洩性慾的色情的歪詩漫畫，堆滿灰塵，棉被彷彿如冷硬的油麵餅，跳蝨多到極點，在鼻子上亂碰亂撞，甫一坐定，立刻周身不遂。這分明已復原到「留人小店」的地步。因此想到接收所以要化爲「刦收」或別的什麽的原因，倒是可由定命來解釋，這眞是註定的命運了嗎。在新鄉一宿十分難過，通宵不安，加之一路所見的印象，如波濤一樣湧起，因爲我是中國人，精神痛苦，比百萬跳蝨的襲擊還厲害。但同樣是一種不知如何是好的感覺。</p>
<p>東望太行</p>
<p>道淸鐵路算是拆光了。東段是敵人所拆；勝利後西段先由共軍領頭拆，路局跟着來搶拆材料。這種典型性的出色競賽精神繼續發揚下去，不說一條鐵路，整個世界都拆得完的。</p>
<p>由開封到鄭州，如避免在黃河擺波的麻煩，可到新鄕來轉車，到安陽去也要在這裏換車，新鄕遂成爲轉運站。旅客必須要在這裏過夜。都是高邊敞車，難得有蓬車，軍遝又忙，紛擾熱鬧，秩序糟極，本來，像這樣荒凉破碎的地方，駛着這種等於逃難的列車還顯得調和些，藍鋼絲絨車反顯出社會的不平。</p>
<p>車出新鄉，路西太行山脈的影子就看見了。這個老年的山脈像老人一樣佝僂萎縮，排在路的西面，幾乎是完全和路並行着。一望無際，氣勢還十分雄壯。它是中國歷史的證人，看過多少變亂：是華民族如何受外族的蹂躪，如何英勇反抗以及如何自相殘殺，它都看盡。中華民族開始脫離山林，走到山麓來從事游收，不停地爭戰，商代農業生活發軔，盤庚定居於洹水之上，就是因爲他們東望太行，想起他們光榮的祖先。</p>
<p>鐵路治綫都是碉堡，有些是日本人遺留下來的，有些則是勝利後的建設成就。從汲縣以至湯陰，都被共軍佔領過，道些建設，運車站水塔在內，都破壞完結，而最先復員的是碉堡，築得又快又好。車子過處，只見値哨的士兵們，立正站在頂上，背向鐵道，特槍遠望太行山，一動也不動。不知是不是火車過時才這樣做。他們還穿着單衣，在風裏　着·</p>
<p>記得抗戰開始時，朱德將軍作過一首詩：「佇馬太行側，十月雪飛白；將士怯衣單，夜夜呼殺賊。」記者今日過太行山東麓，憶及此詩，回想當年全民抗戰的盛况，誠願有全民建國的大舉出現於今日。</p>
<p>商人談話</p>
<p>車中全是軍人，到湯陰時走上一個穿便衣的商人，攀談起來，知是安陽電廠的。據善後救濟分署的調査報吿，安陽電廠在抗戰中損壞程度是百分之七十；但據他說是沒有損失，比八年前他們離開安陽時還稍多了一些設備。他說今春開三個月車，那時煤價還便宜，可是虧了八百萬。現在安陽的煤價是每噸十六萬，電機是五百基羅，鍋爐每天燒三個小時，要六噸煤，可是每月的電費只能收四百萬。他凑到我耳朶上來輕輕地說：</p>
<p>「官家是不出錢的，還有軍隊。他們除開不搗蛋之外，啥忙也帮不到。』</p>
<p>「總而言之一句話，這種賣買以有讓官自己來辦。老百姓反正幹不了。」</p>
<p>我們正徘徊於殘破的站台上，站台上有僞組織時所立的「岳飛故里」碑，立碑的人名一大羣，若千個已被　去，大約是漢奸，運奸也謳頌岳飛，不倫不類，然而歷史是終究不能抹殺的。</p>
<p>「西面七八里地就有共軍。」他指向太行山。太行山區在共車控制之下，沒有煤，煤從鄭州運來。到安陽時遇到另一個商人，聽他口音，是中原子弟，他自鄭州運來一百袋煤，每袋二百幾十斤。在鄭州每市斤五十三元，安陽市價一千元十一斤。他還是初次做這種買賣，他對這種賺錢生意不禁大感頭痛。</p>
<p>除開從鄭州煤棧運到車站月台的運費不算，平漢路收運費票簽費，每袋四五千元，莫名其妙的脚力三百元，裝轉力五百元，託人辦裝運手續的手續　六百元，車站上另要看夜費一百元，過磅費一百元，登記費一百元，每袋煤化六千多元，上車之後，到新鄕車站，騐車匠又要錢，吾則就說車皮壞了不能開，只能　在新鄉。到安陽後又是脚力，裝卸，寄棧，運費等等，運進安陽城門，檢査嚴厲，警察照例每件要收二百元的「稅」，進城後又要「落地稅」，是一個什麽稅局來收的，每件五百元。</p>
<p>他化了一百幾十萬本錢，半個月時間，冒險運煤到安陽來，賺不滿十萬塊錢，這是一個眞正的商人。</p>
<p>從交通機關，工人組織，地方機構，以至稅務機關，無處不將你擠軋住，要錢。隨心所欲，全無法度，這是政治混亂的深刻反映。法在那裏？這決不是局部現象，近之，請看京滬。</p>
<p>安陽砲聲</p>
<p>自湯陰以南至安陽以北的渾河邊（國共軍對峙一年的地方），國　在這里保持一個相當狹長而突出的地帶。這決不是什麽軍事秘密，老百姓都知道的。但消息的混沌無過於豫北。當遠達千里外的保定中央社發出了國軍北渡漳河，收復磁縣邯鄲的消息之後，這裘的軍民不免大爲吃驚。我雖然懷疑，但並不在安陽，現在一跑到這裏，趕快發一個電報說明這裏的眞實形勢，這是我的責任。</p>
<p>「一年以來，我們老在這裏擺起架子挨打。」軍方的衛級負　人對我這樣說。我研究了國軍兵力和部署的形勢之後，發覺新華社所傳國軍限期打通若干條鐵路的消息，也是不正確的。最低限度，平漢路方面根本連影子也沒有一點。這都是明明叫讀者爲難。</p>
<p>有命令限制記者到前方去，在中國的土地上，某個區域裏彈如雨下，人民基本自山都失掉了，連生命也如草芥，對新聞自由本質上已是一種諷刺。我不想扛這塊在中國已經用爛了的招牌，但我有請當局發佈正確新聞的自由，免得我們的同業受罪，讀者蒙蔽。</p>
<p>幾天以前，共軍增有六個旅的番號開到安陽以西地區，揚言攻城，安陽的城防緊張，檢査嚴厲，廿里以外正在開火。今大晚上八點鐘，我執筆寫稿時就有隆隆的砲聲從城西傳來。</p>
<p>居民一年來已經習慣了這種危城生活，仍安然處之。但軍方則堅勸我不要到小屯去，雖然離城只有五里。說是共軍的便衣到處是。「千金之十，坐不垂堂」云。</p>
<p>居民的鎭靜如常是可驚的。滿街是兵，湧來湧去，實在城圈太小，無處可玩。商店是只有小舖子，因爲攤派重，大一點的買賣不能也不敢做。難民佔住房子，到處找房子的機關又把難民趕出來，安陽遂成爲一個人口擁擠而市况冷落的軍事繁榮城市。</p>
<p>北方來去</p>
<p>北關外的市集熱鬧透了，人簡直就像潮水一樣，夾着大車小軍，牲口，揚起嗆人的灰塵，到處陳列着　子，土豆，梨子，棉花，土布，種種農產，從北方來豬，瓜子。充滿了叫嚷和呼噪，食物攤士上的烟和油味到處飛揚。經紀人托着算盤，攢來攢去·整個區域有一里多長。</p>
<p>這裏有從大名，臨漳，南樂來的，帶過來貨物和各種故事。帶回去的也是貨物和故事，還有法幣。共軍把抗幣一元當法幣四元收兌，現在跌價，黑市是一比三。</p>
<p>北方來去的車子都是小車，豬，鹽”瓜子和梨。四種貨物共軍都允許運過漳河，但要徵百分之十到廿的稅。</p>
<p>「他們對經紀人的收人抽百分之六十的稅。」我同一個大名來的賣梨者對坐在蓆上，蓆上堆滿了梨，他有說不完的故事，他說：「你要上報嗎？你寫兩天兩晚也寫不完。」</p>
<p>他說的是許多非刑的故事。都日公開的。用民衆大會方式舉性。我因爲一路聽得多了，現在只想求進一步的證實。你能不信有這種事實，但我却相信這個漢子的談話。他說一個村人被用繩子扣住兩個大姆脚指，倒吊在樹上，召全村民衆去看，一個婦女受驚而死。這是全部故事之一。鎭壓異已或懲治違反共黨政府的法律，共軍宣佈這人死刑，或在「情理」之中，可是這種公開作爲社會敎育性的非刑，就頗難想像。道是殘酷的鬥爭！</p>
<p>這市集幾乎就是共軍區消息的總匯，難民都來找同鄉帶信以及打聽家鄕情况。北方來去，是一條險道。那些大車夫，舉着鞭子，大步的踏着北方風沙，噓噓噠噠，那笨重的車輛搖搖幌幌，慢慢地在不平的道路上走着，正像北方的命運一樣，它的險　的歷程，走了五千年還是沒有走完。</p>

<p>— 余無言</p>
<p>魚落貓兒口不肯吐出來</p>
<p>「地據長江東盡頭，魚鹽棉豆是新州，萬家烟火膏腴地，鬥盡三資尙未休·」這一首是筆者胡亂記詠家鄕情形的小詩，溯自與數萬難民，同樣狼狽地逃出家鄕「啓東」以來，業已半載有餘，體味到這六七個月的流亡生活所受的痛苦，回想到半世安居樂業的家園，直有些黯然傷心，然而我還是欣幸，目前雖在度難民生活，可是身體總算依然是頑健如昔。</p>
<p>啓東本稱崇明外沙，位居長江北口，泥土因潮流的衝積卑聚，面積日大，人口日多，與崇明隔六七十里的江面，因治理上不便，早發動分縣運動。十七年國府建都南京，蘇主席鈕永建，民廳茅祖權，俯允外沙人民的請求，准予設治，定名「啓東」，第一任縣長袁希洛氏，是本省耆紳。這位老人家現尙健在，不久以前，曾電請毛澤東先生退出蘇北共軍所部，以救萬民，並請政府撥派專機，擬直飛延安，親去跪求，可惜毛先生未動慈悲一念，置之不理，合了一句俗諺，「魚落貓兒口」。請毛先生退出蘇北，似乎比請貓兒從口裏吐出魚來，更困難。</p>
<p>「啓東」，這小小的一角土地，在蘇被整個地形上，固然僻處東南海隅，未必佔着軍略上的重要地位，得失無關重輕，自從兩淮收復，運河綫打通以後，共軍的主力，積聚中部東合興化鹽早一帶，政府也把注意力集巾在那邊，但是共軍在蘇北劫聚的大量物資，都須搬運消化，北搬齊魯，走隴海綫經過，旣有相當困難，南運比較便利，他們利用政府忽略這一點，就把啓東成爲東南部消化物資的總匯，水上交通便利，所以滿載花衣苞米麥豆的船隻，大量地由啓東各港流出，南運淞滬常熟各埠，北走山東靑島一路，交換他們所需要的物資和法幣。</p>
<p>啓東設治後，即有共黨發現，十九年便發動了有名「八八劫獄案」的大暴動。此一事變雖經政府敉平，但是公敎機關中，常有不少共黨潛伏。抗戰中經數度游雜部隊的火併，和敵偽的進駐，百姓直吃盡了苦頭。黃橋事件，新四軍奠定了揚泰以東的基礎，游雜部隊不參於（僞，即入於共。啓東潛伏的共黨，明目張膽地出現，百姓因受盡了游擊隊和敵僞的痛苦，對於共軍的僞善，曾寄予甚天的好感。勝利後，共車收繳敵僞槍枝，高唱「解放」，但人民並未得到撫綏休養的機會。在他們積極組織各種男女青年農工商學的抗關會聲中，旣推動了肅奸肅反倒租淸算等運動，又復實行分田分物的鬥爭，人民遂大感蹙首。迨至窮翻隊的亂攪，行動的管制，三資的屠殺，於是，認識了共軍的眞面目，由好感而惡感，惡感而痛心，痛心而至于逃亡。</p>
<p>逃掉了和尚卻逃不了廟</p>
<p>啓東的共黨將鄉以下分若干村，每村百瞳，設村長一人，在百戶中須組織五十人的基本幹部隊，簡稱基幹隊，分五班，每班十人，輪値服務，配有少數步槍，其餘一律備有柄纏紅布的尖刀，負巡視鄉村盤查逃亡的責任。每鄉設有窮人翻身隊，集聚所有窮人無賴，四出叫囂，找尋淸算鬥爭的對象「資產者」·不需任何藉口，彼鬥爭者，除拿出全部財產外，還須以隱匿財富名義，拘禁若干時日，觀其動作，察其有無，如果先期逃亡，所遺房屋貨物，則予以拆下或搬走。他們提出這樣的口號，「逃了和尙，逃不了廟」。</p>
<p>共軍管制逃亡，相當嚴密。出門上市，皆須備通行證，赴外埠，更須領出口證，證上載明出口緣由，往近時日，（最多一月），並須取具店保，逾期不返，傳間保人。如果經商出門，定時返家，找保尙易，如果怕鬥爭而逃亡，保人因恐事累己身，就極困難。到鄉公所領證，査詢亦够麻煩。證領到了，路上還須經基本隊的盤請，與駐港員的證件檢騐，關於搜査，對所帶貨物，自不必說，完稅的完稅，扣留的扣留，假使在秋季而帶冬令衣服的話，立有發出被扣留的危險，因帶長期居住的衣服，有逃亡嫌疑的原故。</p>
<p>哀禽處處啼欲歸未有期</p>
<p>省府委任之啓東縣長胡曉邨，去年因無法入境，組織流亡縣府于青龍港，收編部隊，預備復員。本年二月中，曾率領全部行政人員，及自衛部隊，配合國軍一團，進駐距縣境十里的靈甸鎭，擬採步步爲營的入境方法，居靈數日，平靜無寧，國軍退回青龍。距共軍于二日內，調集五倍以上之丘力，將駐守靈甸之啓東縣府，予以包圍，繳戰一晝夜，終因械彈不繼，援救不及，全部被繳，損失步槍四五百枝，機槍十餘挺，尙幸胡縣長赴南通出席會議，未被俘獲，經此事變，縣府始流亡崇明。</p>
<p>啓東離淞滬，祗一江之陷，四週崇明，海門，南通，久歸國家懷抱。共軍主力已遠退四五百里，但我啓東二百方里，依舊在其掌握中。卅萬善良民衆，仍陷水深火熱，五萬流亡難民，日常風餐露宿，遙望家鄕，一片烏烟瘴氣，政府發表蘇北戰事，已成尾聲，而這一小角土地，竟還無人存問！我們難民，絕不願有戰事，亦非發洩意氣，但武力乃制暴定亂的唯一方法，己屬定論，國大不久開會，殘年轉瞬向盡，我們的還鄕願望，究將於何時實現呢？</p>

<p>— 危言</p>
<p>近兩期我們刊載過兩篇介紹兒童讀物的文章，很得到許多讀者的擁護。從來信中我們可以看得出，這些擁護我們的讀者一部份是兒童的家長們，一部分是辦兒童刊物的同志們。家長們焦慮着他們的孩子們給那些神怪下流的連環圖書迷惑着，怕他們荒廢了學校的功裏，輸入一些有毒素的思想。辦兒童刊物的先生們焦慮着資本的不够，沒有人肯在這種事業投資，有時也會抱怨着家長們不肯幫助他們推銷。</p>
<p>這裏，我覺得我們應該自己反省一下：何以那些神怪無聊的連環圖書會那樣的受兒童的歡迎？何以有人肯化資本去印行這一類的小書？更何有人肯花資本印這一類連環圖書而不來印行一般所謂高尚的兒童讀物？你說連環圖書的資本小嗎？那末既然他們的資本小而仍可以辦下去，而且有蒸蒸日上之勢，何以我們就不能如此呢？你說因爲那些書的銷路好，而我們的銷路不好，所以沒有人肯投資。那末請問我們對於兒童心理的研究以及我們的普通常識或書圖的技術都不如那些出版神怪下流的連環圖書的作者們嗎？家長們在替那些攤頭的小書宣傳推銷嗎？我們要問問自己：爲甚麼我們所出的兒童讀物不能和連環圖書競爭？爲甚麼我們出版的兒童書報，不受兒童的歡迎？爲甚麼我們不能由於得到普遍的讀者而吸引資本家來投資？</p>
<p>我的答案是說：「非不能，是不爲也！」我不相信我們的智力，知識，技術不如一般出版那些神怪圖書的人們。不過坦白的說，我們之中根本就沒有人肯花那樣的工夫精力去辦一種力求迎合兒童心理的刊物。兒童教育專家們都高高在上圖謀自己更大的發展，那有工夫管這些。肯在兒童刊物上出一個名字已經够好的了。在還沒有出版許多優美的兒童刊物以代替攤頭連環圖書而使兒童捨彼就此之前中國若有人自以爲是兒童教育專家，這是中國兒童教育界的恥辱了！</p>
<h3 id="c163">二千年間 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 童方</p>
<p>著者：蒲韌</p>
<p>出版者：開明書店</p>
<p>出版期：三十五年六月</p>
<p>一般人都把歷史書看做歷代皇帝的家譜。寫法幾乎千篇一律，一年接一年的記載着每年發生的大事，或者一個朝代接一個朝代的記叙下去。比較新的寫法是將整個歷史分成若干階段，一個階段接一個階段地寫。實際上，這些寫法都不是最理想的，因爲歷史是整個的，繼續的，我們即使要把它劃分爲若干時代和階段，也不過是爲研究的便利，我們決不能支離破碎地去看歷史。</p>
<p>最近，蒲韌著的一本「二千年間」可說打破傳統寫歷史的方法，他給我們劃出了一個二千一百多年中國封建專制時代歷史的輪廓。著者從全部五千年的中國歷史中選出較近的二千年來叙說，是因爲這段歷史對於我們現在的人的生活影響特別大。至於寫法則絕不同於他書。它把這二千年當爲一個整體，就其中提供一些值得研究的問題。</p>
<p>從東周開始直到清的滅亡二千餘年的歷史，雖然每個朝代都有很大的變動，我國可能把它分成若干階段，研究每一階段政治，經濟，文化，思想的特質，可是基於社會經濟性質的政治形態的觀點來看，却都是屬於封建專制制主義時代。著者便把握着各個階段的基本的共通性，捨了橫剖面的看法，從縱剖面來檢討這段歷史發展的過程。爲了矯正一般人對於歷史上的糢糊的時間觀念，這本書根據公歷紀元，給中國歷史上的時間觀念整理了一番，並在第一章「二千年的烏瞰」中列了一個表，就書中所談到的一些大事填入「大事記」一項，這樣可以幫助我們對於時間過程獲得一個比較清晰的印象。</p>
<p>書中叙述的二千年的封建專制主義時代，中國並非一直保持着統一大帝國的規模，相反的，由一個統一的政權統治全部國土時期並清江多。有時一部分國土爲外族所侵佔，或是形成幾個政權對立國土分裂的情勢，不過這時期社會政治經濟的本質却是一直停滯在封建專制主義的階段的。溯其成因自然有它的社會經濟政治的背景。長期的封建專制主義時代，廣大的人民所遭受的是外族侵略，戰爭，分裂所遭致的痛苦，真能維持和平統一，真能促進文化發展經濟繁榮的時期實在少得很。假如要問爲什麼會如此，那在本書中到處强調着：由於社會經濟政治的不健全，不合理。</p>
<p>看了這本書，我們會從著者所暴露出來血淋淋的史實，體察到中國處於封建專制主義時代的人民，是怎樣的呻吟於統治者侵略者的壓迫下怎樣的爲爭取自身的自由與解放而奮鬥，怎樣的期待未來的歷史展開一條新的生路。同時，因爲封建專制主義內在的矛盾，怎樣的顯示出它崩潰滅亡的必然性，也在著者的筆下深刻地刻劃出來了。他給我們分析出封建專制主義的統治權力及其機構，再討論到農業社會組成的單位——農村，如何成爲統治者的權力所憑藉的經濟基礎。由於農民的自覺種種叛亂和騷動便接連地發生，而異族入犯和侵略也便成了無法遏阻的一種勢力了。</p>
<p>本書包括着下面幾件重要的叙述：（一）專制皇帝怎樣產生，怎樣世襲，怎樣換朝易代，怎樣惹致皇族內部的糾紛。（二）官僚制度怎樣腐敗，怎樣違害民族國家的利益。（三）皇帝爲了鞏固自己的寶座，怎樣担心着兵權被人民所奪，怎樣利用兵權以維持統治者的特殊地位。（四）歷史上中國的農民怎樣依土地生活，地主，官僚，貴族，怎樣以農民的勞動，土地上的收獲來供養自己，而土地的耕耘者農民怎樣過着被奴役的生活。（五）農民怎樣自覺地站起來發動戰爭，並指出他們失敗的原因及其在歷史上的意義。（六）從塞外各族的怎樣興替，說出我們邊塞的不平靖的原因，侵略和被侵略的分別，以及歷代　　政權的怎樣仍舊免不了失敗。（七）胡騎踏進中國以後，「兒皇帝「二臣」」和救國的英雄怎樣應運產生，南渡君臣怎樣輕視「社稷。」（八）變法運動怎樣不能真正解決當時的政治經濟問題，以及封建專制怎樣逃不開失敗的命運。</p>
<p>從這裏我們得到不少有力的啓示：歷史的發展應該有它的必然性的古代的史事和我們今日的現實生活，實在是有着緊密的關聯的。就像這本書所寫的二千餘年的社會的變動，和目前的社會的情形不謀而合。今日廣大的中國人民所需要的也正像歷史上中國的人民所需要的一樣，迫切地期待着一個合理的健全的社會的產生。同時我們也有着這樣的堅强的信念：慈善人民離開人民的人，必難逃避崩潰的命運。過去是如此，目前還是如此。人民的力量像一支熱流，它將成爲推進歷史創造歷史的主力。</p>
<h3 id="c164">讀「性心理」 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 日本　靄理斯原著　馮明章譯</p>
<p>文摘出版社　卅四年六月四版</p>
<p>在這繁華複雜的都市里，如果到那些書報攤小書店裏去瀏覽，那一定能看到許多性指導性健康一類的書偽裝了教育意味的名目，來欺騙青年；如果受了它這騙，那一定有那種不純潔的思想，在你那腦髓中，輸進了一味毒素。</p>
<p>因爲這樣，一般人士對於凡關於「性」一類的書，就特別看輕，好像這書是骯髒得不值一瞧的；那當然也有的是那些人們天生的高貴，與中國祖傳的「道德」觀的束縛；或有的就因爲如前述偽裝面目的書太多，因而推論出凡是有這樣一個「性」字就是不潔的，嚴重地忽視了這門智識。</p>
<p>際此新時代巨輪在推動的時候，如上的那些觀念我們再要不得了；凡一個新青年，這一知識的要求，也是諸科學中不可缺失的一門。</p>
<p>眼前，我們可以看到蜜秋斯譯的「性教育新論」，與這本「性心理」，二書都是很純正的一種知識讀物；前者記得出版界曾經介紹過。現在，我謹將這本書介紹給諸位青年朋友。</p>
<p>這本書在英美的醫學界和社會一般人士，受到熱烈地歡迎。這類性知識的書籍，在歐美前進諸國，是很受到歡迎的，唯有這道德的中國，才有那種不必要的貌視。</p>
<p>藹理斯在重版序文中說：「我的書，最敵重的批評都沒有否定它的價值，我覺得我還可以有信心地讓它出下去，是一本研究人生最重要的一面的入門書。」</p>
<p>正如作者所言，這是「研究人生最重要的一面」的知識；作者曾作過七大本「性心理研究」，和這本簡明扼要的「性生理」，他底著作，重點均在於性的正常現象，不偏重於任何一面，這是尤值得注意的。一般人士（無論正常的，失常的）都有同來一讀的價值。</p>
<p>我們知道，性心理與社會關係是密切地聯繋着；這一點雖不爲普通所注意，而我們大概可以很相信吧。一個青年由於性的種種現象，而使他底一切人生觀都會革變，這與社會之間，不是已產生了一層嚴重的關係。尤其是在大戰以後，經濟動亂着的狀態中，性的墮落現象格外容易發生，從而社會上的影響更不良。</p>
<p>本書中，它述明「性的生物基礎」，關於自然基礎，性衝動本性，性感，挑的生物學分析，配偶的因素等均予以詳確之闡述。青春期的性衝動；結婚；各部份都引了許多章節來分析，及給予讀者一種智識性底啓示。</p>
<p>這之間，對於性變態，「納喜」愁，性教育，適宜的結婚，完滿的結婚，一夫一妻制，生育控制，貞潔，戀愛藝術，昇華等等，均以適當之舉例闡述。</p>
<p>本書中所列問題，是性知識中較詳細的，最至要的：這本書並非偽裝面目的書，而是切實指導及說明「性心理」的書。</p>
<p>普通地大學裏都沒有性心理的科目，似乎這與動物生活底領域裏毫不相關似的；因之，一旦發生由此而引起的嚴重病症時，就有人無謂地犧牲在「無知」裏了！</p>
<p>這現象大概看見得不是少數的！</p>
<p>總之，應有的知識，在我們青年所必求的自然是社會科學，史地，哲學，而在這些範圍之外，也應注意到這人生問題的一門常識！</p>

<p>— 鄭家瑗　巧尼雪夫斯基著　世彌譯</p>
<p>薇娜十六歲的那年，就停止上學，開始教書去了；這是她母親安排好的；並且還要她穿戴得很漂亮，以引起公子哥兒們的注意；這時候女房主的兒子米雪爾，正看中了她，追求甚力，薇娜的母親也滿以爲這是件好姻緣，竭力拉攏他們；她對女兒說：「豐衣足食地過一輩子吧！現今的世上，凡是不誠實和惡毒的人都很幸福的，這是真理，……我們生存在舊式的制度裏面，是沒法依照新的方式過活的……因此，我們祇好依着古老的秩序，利用旁人，欺騙旁人，你也得一樣，你一定要抓住機會，而且還要欺騙……。」可是薇娜不這樣想，她自從受了一個法國浪漫女子的影響後，開始了解愛情的真諦，再加上女房主爲了門第關係，反對這件婚事；薇娜倒可以從容不迫地應對着他們了。不久以後，在她一次生日的晚上，她第一次遇到了樂卜何夫，她弟弟的教書先生；他的開始戀愛，後來又偷偷地結了婚，樂卜何夫答應她給她婚後的絕對自由，直到她母親發覺的時候，大發一陣雷霆也就算了。他們住在小小的屋子裏，兩人全以教書來維持生活，雖然不很豐裕；然而他們是融和愉快的；之後，薇娜組織了一個縫衣女工生產合作社，事業進行很順利，她把所有的盈餘利益，公平地分給女工們；她對她們說：「有的人想建築一幢美麗的房子，有的人載種美麗的樹木，或者建築一幢溫室，　使眼睛舒適，至於在我，我要組織一所美麗的縫衣工場，使我的靈魂得到快樂！」——在女工們的以上中，薇娜永遠是她們最善良的領袖。</p>
<p>一次，樂卜何夫生了病，他的朋友奇爾沙諾夫是個年輕的醫師，爲他診治好疾病後，就變成他們家往來最勤的客人了。他溫柔的言語，他的動作，他的態度都成了薇娜心中永遠　　的回憶，尤其他豐富的藝術知識，更爲她傾倒；他們常在一處，享受着優美的內心生活；她戀愛着這位風度文雅的醫師，然而她的心中却是凄苦的這件事；樂卜何夫知道得很清楚，但並不會嫉妒的表示，爲着遵守他的信仰，他依舊好心地慰藉她，因此薇娜決心要捨棄這份多餘的感情，不再和奇爾沙諾夫頻頻晤面了。</p>
<p>最後，樂卜何夫成全了他的妻子，他在聖彼堡的旅館裏住宿的那晚，據說已跳河自殺；薇娜知道這噩訊後，感傷萬分，她說：「這是我傷害了他的。」於是堅決要遠離開年輕的醫師，到別處去找生活；其實樂卜何夫並沒有死；他在給薇娜最後的一封信中，這樣寫着：「我並沒有自殺，我不過要逃避　　的眼光，和給你一條再紙之路；努力愛奇爾沙諾夫，他是值得你愛的，你們應該快樂；至於我，一個重大的工作需要着我，我要替自由　　斯的建造奠上一塊基石。」故事就這樣結束了，薇娜含着眼淚，懷着一顆感激的心，爲她曾經熱愛過的丈夫，永遠祝福着。</p>
<p>「何爲」是巧爾尼雪夫斯基N.　Tohcrnislievsky在一八六三年寫就的，那期間他監禁在獄內，本書出版後不久，又被流放到西伯利亞，以後的二十年，他都以驕傲的態度，度着這困苦的放逐生活，他崇高的人格曾感動過無數人羣，正如巴金所說：「他希望在這部小說裏，給當時的青年男女指示一條道路，告訴他們應該做的事情。」這本書的主角，不是英雄，也不是超人；他們不過祇憑着自己觀察的結論，應用到道德方面去，他們否定一切過去的傳統的習俗，他們的態度是那樣的自然，樸質；他們所信仰的就在行爲上顯示出來，他們主張個人的自由，權利和創意性，也傾向着共同的善良和萬人的幸福！這就是他們生活的特徴。</p>
<p>巧氏還想從這裏解決一下婦女問題：他要昭示我們，追求應享的自由，和獲得知識的權利；新女型是不能容忍傳統的桎梏的！從自己的著作內他創造出一個爲女性所渴望的典型來，指示她們應有的觀念和該走的道路。</p>
<p>巧氏的作品除了思想上發出驚人的光彩外，並沒有什麼特殊文藝方面的貢獻，他從不用文字的美妙，强調故事的氣氛，他是那樣樸質無華，他在情節進展和寫作技巧方面又表現得那樣平凡無奇；他就是這樣！瓦利柴夫斯基曾經說他缺乏藝術和詩的色彩；這是很真實的；他也許根本沒有這方面的企圖，他所要求的，就是作品本身的力量——在闡明自己的理論罷了。</p>
<p>「何爲」雖是一本舊作，可是如今當我們翻閱的時候，作者思想的精華仍然發出了無比的光彩；在這八十年間，我們人類的社會究竟有鑠和新的進展？我們對於生活和幸福的真諦又認清了幾許？尤其對於婦女問題，我們倒底獲得了什麼啓示？我們不過是在抄襲着前一代的生活方式，委曲求全，歪曲或埋沒了一已的個性，在愛情方面，我們更喪失掉神聖和尊嚴，做了變相賣買的奴隸。八十年前的巧爾尼雪夫斯基，爲着要想求得新的答案，被幽閉在冷酷的地獄裏；而今天，一世紀將過去了，我們却囚禁在自己凄楚的「心獄」內受難！</p>

<h3 id="c167">恢復「文藝茶話會」 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>民國二十一年六月，孫春苔（福熙）主編「小貢獻」；在第五號（六月五日）上，春苔提出了「星期日做什麼事？」在第六號（六月六日）裏，張立民，沈辛提起同樣的問題。接着，王庚在第七號（六月七日）裘，問：「我們如何利用暑假？」筆者就在該刋第十二號（六月十二日）裘，「提倡星期茶話會」，乃指法國沙龍式的茶話會。這個「回答」激起了盛大的共鳴。二十一年六月十九日下午四時，在上海環龍路花園別墅三號，春苔府上，由春苔夫人劉雪崖女士主持，開了首次「文藝茶話會」。參加的有：華林，孫春苔，劉雪崖，汪亞塵夫婦，李唯建夫婦，章衣萍夫婦，徐仲年夫婦，等等。這次的會是沙龍式的，由春苔夫婦作東。第二次的「文藝茶話會」於六月二十六日下午三時舉行，地點在新雅酒樓西厢。這次的會奠定了「文藝茶話會」的本質，也就是揮發了它的個性。</p>
<p>在當時，甚至直到十四年後的今日，「文藝茶話會」是一個澈底民主，澈底自由的集團：它的被人歡迎在乎此。筆者在拙文「提倡星期茶話會」裘，說得很淸楚：「我不願集會有什麼形式。何况我們想快樂地過這星期日，如果要搭臭架子，舉什麽主席，書記，豈不糟了？倘使要用什麽硏究會名義，那纔叫做隔年端陽肉——今日恰是端陽——其臭不可聞也。至於友誼會這個名字，未嘗不可以用；只是我在已成立的諸友誼會中，常常逢到不友不誼的事情：此名不祥，去之爲宜。……我們大家是兩袖淸風的敎授或學生，我們不必要誰請客，我們自己請自己：大家搭分子出錢來買茶點，豈不痛快！」歸納起來，「文藝茶話會」的特點是：（一）掃除一切形式主義，願來則來，願去即去，自由自在，無拘無束；（二）打破一切功利主義，不妄企「御用」他人，也不甘「被御用」於人；（三）提倡純潔友誼主義，以文藝會友，圖半日之歡，一吐心中積鬱；（四）鼓吹高尙利他主義，編輯者可以和作家接洽稿件，畫苑主持人可以和藝術家商量展覽等等，以及組織小規模的音樂會，演一講會，招待過滬文藝家，以至最簡單的擺龍門陣。</p>
<p>如果大家愛吸純潔自由的空氣，如果有人承認不含功利色彩的友誼是崇高可貴的，如果我們還重視人類尊嚴不甘退化爲算盤，那麽，一個像「文藝茶話會」那樣的會就得存在！就得發展！而「文藝茶話會」確乎存在，確乎發展過。最初，每星期日開會更換一個地方，繼而固定在福祿壽。每次人數或數十人，或數百人。有的時候，有人招待我們：例如前新華藝專校長徐朗西先生，冠生園主人洗冠生先生，以及其他諸位。我手頭恰有冼冠生先生招待我們時所攝的小照；參加那次茶話會的有。（隨筆而書）張蓓英，郁風，陳艾蘊，徐鑑如，徐蕙芳諾女士，汪亞　夫婦，吳作人火婦，孫春苔夫婦，張仲賢夫婦，江文新夫婦，一對法國夫婦，汪亞塵，許士騏，徐蔚南，郞魯遜，陸丹林，孫弼伍，李燄生，工臨乙，范存忠，陳靈犀，高方，胡文藻等先生，東道主洗冠生先生，以及筆者自己，共四十五人。我想不起那一次爲何華林，黃天鵬，陳承蔭等沒有參加？我們玩渦蘇州；「文藝茶話」第一卷第十期內，有曾今可的「天堂歸來」，孫福熙的「文藝茶話在蘇州舉行」，記載此遊。有好幾次，我們招待過外籍文學家或藝術家，例如那位意大利畫家査農先生：孫福熙在「藝風」第二卷第四期（二十三年四月）裏，寫有：「中國的好朋友查農先生」，記載他和他的展覽會。我們擴大我們的交誼範圍，甚而在檳榔路玉佛寺開第一百六十九次茶話會，恭請圓瑛法師爲我們演講：「佛敎，文學，和藝術」，出席者一百五十人；因爲有法國來賓多人，就由筆者口譯圓瑛法師的演講：那是廿四年七月七日的事，北平法文週刋「北京政聞報」（一九三五年八月三十一日）刋有那次茶話會的照相多幀。不單在上海，我們在南京，杭州，香港，以及「八·一三」以後在重慶，也舉行類似「文藝茶話會」：在南京，稱作「文藝供樂部」，每星期四晚舉行，由華林，張蓓英，筆者，陳曉南主持；在杭州的也叫做「文藝茶話會」，以杭州藝專爲中心，由孫福熙主持；香港的「文藝茶話會」在香港半山堅尼地「四人畫室」舉行，由陳福善，王少陵主持；——在那時候，每週孫春苔滬杭往返一次，我則京滬往返一次。至於重慶的茶話會，稱作「星六茶座」，由筆者，魯覺吾（即魯莽），華林發起和主持；——最近，華林在上海把這個「茶座」恢復了。那個時代，茶話會的友好刋物有。我們輪流主編的「文藝茶話」；華林，孫福熙，黃天鵬，徐仲年主編的「彌羅週刋」和「彌羅叢書」；徐仲年主編的「美術生活」（該刋文藝欄就叫「文藝茶話」和「星期文藝」；孫福熙主編的「藝風」和「小　獻」；李燄生主編的「新壘」；陳靈犀主編的「社會」；陸錫楨主編的「華安」；華林主編的「中央日報副刋」；黃天鵬主編的「靑光」。筆者留重慶九年有餘，今年八月十二日纔肯定回上海；人事六索，尙未整理書籍：所知「文藝茶話會」的史實僅止於此，將來當能有更詳盡的叙述。</p>
<p>復員歸來，我們這批公敎人員有幾項普遍的感觸：（一）窮忙，窮忙，窮則忙，我們比戰前窮，比戰前忙；（二）交通比戰前困難，看朋友大非易事；（三）一天到晚無從休息，也沒法休息，精神太緊張！於是我想起了十四年來，表面上似斷似續，骨子裏祗有蛻變，而未壽終的「文藝茶話會」。我們幾位老「茶友」華林，汪亞塵，孫福熙，陳承蔭會商之後，決計使它復興。上星期一，——迄今整整一星期，——承蔭邀我到大新公司五樓「五層樓酒家」去吃中飯。他和該樓經理陳國琳先生談起此事。陳先生熱烈贊成，情願帮忙：</p>
<p>（一）每星期日下午四至六時爲茶話會時間；</p>
<p>（二）劃出一所特別廳，爲茶話會地點；</p>
<p>（三）每客「茶」和「點」兩千元（實吃四千元的茶點），參加者自惠。</p>
<p>該樓董事長包誠德先生也是一位風雅之士，又與承蔭友好，決計會贊助我們的；而且我們一定邀包陳兩光生參加，像當年福祿壽的經理張丹子先生那樣。</p>
<p>當年的「時事新報」帮了我們不少忙。這次「申報」文藝副刋「春秋」的主編王進珊兄願意參加，並義務效勞：每星生期日在「春秋」上刋載「文藝茶話會邀東，」俾衆週知。我們除了歡迎進珊參加並表示謝意外，還希望「新聞報」「新園林」的主編嚴獨鶴先生同樣帮忙：我們猜想嚴先生不致拒絕，因爲「文藝茶話會」不屬於任何人或任何集團，而是文人藝友們所共同有的，包括獨鶴先生自己在內。</p>
<p>三十五年十月二十七日（星期日）應該是「文藝茶話會」復蘇的日子：諸位舊雨新友曷興乎來！</p>
<p>上海；三五年十月廿一日，星期一。</p>

<p>— 宋祝平</p>
<p>生長在南國的孩子們，是永遠不會想到。在這個近沙漠高原上的秋天，該是怎麽樣的一個季節。</p>
<p>秋天，在江南，正是好天氣呢。鬱鬱的林叢，潺潺的溪水，綠林裏夾雜着艷紅的楓葉，一切，都是那麼幽靜，優美，給人一種輕巧的說不出的美感。當晚風輕輕的送來暮色，星星在天上熌爍，農家在歸途上自在的唱起怡情的山歌，四野遠處，明滅的浮動着家家戶戶點亮了的燈火，烟囱裏飄起縷縷炊烟，大地是朦朧了，淡淡的抹上一層迷人的色彩，是糢糊不淸的，而又那麼深沉。江南秋天的向晚，總是道麼輕輕悄悄的，像一個溫柔，多情的少女，這是多麽令人依戀的呵！</p>
<p>在塞上，你能想到麽？秋天，一個凄凉多愁的日子呵！暮秋的落寞之感，總會默默的纏住異鄉人空虛了的心。秋天的風，帶來了着殺，落葉開始隨着風飄舞了，田野是那麽黯淡，正像黑夜快來了一樣，這裏是沒有楓葉的，祇有蘋果的葉子是變的淡紅了，這也會惹人神往呢。</p>
<p>有月亮的夜晚，夜是靜極了，靜的會使你什麼也覺不出來，月光像水，風悄悄的掠過你的身邊，多冷淸呵！天更高了，藍的湛湛的，像一片平靜的海。生長在海邊的孩子，看慣了浩瀚無邊際，波濤澎湃的海，常冷冷的月光，滲透了浪遊人的心，能不惹起鄕思麽？</p>
<p>以後，在這個多風沙的高原上，日子該是更陰鬱了。天氣是寒酷的，冰封住了那自遠方流下來的河水，它是流向大海裏去的呢。風像一支雄壯的歌曲，從大漠上帶來了渙天的黃沙，雪花也會不時的飄起來。你愛風麽？或者是雪呢？它們會帶你想的很遠很遠的。如果你會幻想，那麽，你靜靜的想吧！在無邊際的大漠草原上，草低下了頭，一片灰白色，成羣的野馬，多高駿呵！也有塞上健美多情的姑娘，騎着沒有繮和鞍的馬，在草原上，像飛一樣，儘情的奔馳，你的心會跟着飛去了麽？</p>
<p>這裏，是一塊古老而貧瘠的土地，正和別的地方一樣殘破，苦難。在很古的時候，到處是遊牧人的足跡，以後，在一個大動亂裏，人爲的災難便多了。你一定會想到，這裏的人民，該是更貧窮了吧！這一羣淳樸的人羣，用自己的力量，古老的方法，翻新着古老的土地，一直到了收穫。他們承受着這命運注定了的不幸，沉默着，像如今高原上愁人的季節。不過，現在它是稍稍安靜了，但是，安靜是更會惹起人的愁思的。</p>
<p>我不會忘了，這裏也是多山，但是，並不像江南的山，是秀應而峻偉，它是氳氤着濃郁黃土的氣息，山該是更古老了。江南的孩子，是不會喜歡這裏的，這裏沒有江南那種優美，輕柔的情調呢在但是，你總不應該忘記，這種雄壯，而且是有着雪花，大風沙的塞上呵！</p>
<h3 id="c171">再論日記 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 習喜</p>
<p>翁文恭日記於當時制度人物都很有些論述爲旁人所不及知。但可惜不甚詳細。然細細翻檢，可以發見不少重要材料。他的父親文端也有日記，尙朱影印，曾見傳鈔本，也有些珍聞。</p>
<p>他有一段咸豐三年預備鑄金幣的記載，據說是桂良（恭王的岳父）奏請的，打算將庫存的金鐘鎔化，査得一黃鐘八百十斤，一林鐘七百十五斤，一太簇六百二十斤，皆乾隆五十五年鑄，後來鎔成了些金條呈上去沒有下文了。似如當時竟鑄成金幣發行，倒是幣制史上一大事，這件事沒有正式的紀載，所以甚可貴。</p>
<p>他曾做過管庫大臣，所述銀庫情形頗有趣味，庫中有所謂祖寳，就是最大最老的元寳。分量最重的有一千六百兩一錠，上面刻着『嘉靖歲丁不陽月潘南山主人造』這一定是民間富戶所造後來沒入官的。在以前銀櫃中滿堆着元寳一直堆到房頂，要點査或取銀，必須上梯子，有一個梁上尙放着兩個茶杯一條褥子，就可證明這種情形。這茶杯褥子是當時辦事的人隨手留下的，後來元寳少了，這樣高的地方也就不容易再拿下來了，新的存銀地方是木桶而不是櫃，一個桶可藏四十萬兩，然而大半空了。據鄭親王說，從前庫中有一缸水銀，問管庫的人，都不知道，（以上都是翁氏所記）官物慢慢化爲私有，連皇室最親信的人也只好裝聾作啞。</p>
<p>還有緞疋庫（現在北平南池子還有這地名）也藏着一疋四尺八寸寬八丈長的大綾，也是祖寳之意，大的必要他來鎭庫的。這個庫墻厚八尺，窗皆鐵櫺，再加鐵扇，可謂堅固愼重。而這次査庫還不査完已經着火了。（咸豐五年事）不明明是監守自盜放火滅迹麽？這裏面不知道民間多少蠶女織婦的血汗葬送在灰堆裏。</p>
<p>最奇怪的是査到西十庫的時候，發見蜈蚣骨一條，長四尺餘，左右足各三十二。蟒皮一卷，寬尺餘，長不知幾丈。蝦蟆皮一條，寬長的三尺餘。蝎虎全條草楦，長的三尺許。龜殼一方，寬尺餘而長倍之。這一定是明朝留下來的各處訪求所得怪物。明朝享國長久，家法特別，在野史上可以看到許多奇異的制度文物，不是我們所能想像的。</p>
<p>西十庫是明朝藏銀幣絲布五金顏料紙張硝磺各庫，一共十處，佔皇城西北角，這一帶向來空曠少人，明朝太監練兵就在近處，淸代漸漸廢棄，光緒中拿一部分地方黨給天主敎建立現在所謂北堂，其中還有些舊日庫房建築，非常陰森黯淡，令人想起歷史的陳迹，庫子年被團民圍攻流了不少血的。惟有硝磺一庫到民國還存在，聽說敵偽時期改建了一個偽北大附屬醫院。上面所說的怪物，不知什麼時候燒掉或毁減了。</p>
<h3 id="c172">一寸山河一寸血　　71 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>大家吃了點心之後，果然活動了些。看看也快四點了。發動的時候迫近了，情報，電話，電訊，也特別加多了。直到四點半左右，忽地一切漸漸靜止起來。最後的一個聲音，是隊長對我們辦公室內幾個人所發的命令，「時間快到了，各位請把要辦的事，思索一下，準時發動。」辦公室內，也於是完全靜止了。</p>
<p>我退到室角，同虎弟坐在一起，輕輕問他一切都準備好了沒有。我把自己的小佩劍，手槍，子彈匣，和「百寳囊」裏的捲帶，止血藥，一小包餅干，牛肉乾，剪刀，自來火，孔明丹，綫香，茶葉，等等，一一檢視了一下。這本來是我們在東北打游擊用的一小袋東西，爲了防備萬一，也整備下了。虎弟的配備，同我的不差什麼，只少了一匣帶子彈，和一把佩劍，他認爲這在他，是多餘的東西。</p>
<p>同時我把一張小紙拿出來，從新溫習一下。這是用我自己的密碼，記錄我同虎弟的任務——1巡視攻擊及佔領僞府；2虎弟助圍殷逆住宅，擒賊，（我本人）監視繳械的完成工作，3會合虎弟出城，巡視作戰進行4回辦事處彙集情報——。這是我們在中午十二點以前必須完成的任務。我們各人隨身帶着三名快報助手，以便隨時隨地傳遞消息，不斷的同本部聯絡，因恐電話不便，或遭割斷。並且希望每小時左右回部報吿一次，否則即須着人說明不能回部原因——。</p>
<p>我把這四條任務，默記一遍，又輕聲對虎弟述說一遍，並囑咐他個別工作的時候，千萬不能斷絕連絡，省得我替他躭心。他一一都點頭答應。</p>
<p>這時五點鐘只差二十分了。在一切寂靜之後”眞覺得每小時眞有六十分鐘，每分鐘也眞有六十秒；而每秒也居然也有那麽一段時間，這一小段一小段的時間，也眞覺得有些難得過去。我想很多人都有這麽一點經騐——在神經極度緊張之下，等候一種尅期的動作——譬如有人知道一個定時炸彈，在二十分鐘內必定爆發，在每一分一秒鐘過去的過程上，他的情緒該是如何的興奮。</p>

<p>令出必行，現在，我們似乎還未能澈底做到，威信畢竟次焉者也，在行政效率上，至堪憂慮！</p>
<p>其所以然者，大部分責任得由主事當局負。倘使一件事，事前審愼週詳老慮，有具體而完密的計劃；臨事處置公正，有決斷，有氣魄，不含糊，不牽就。相信不僅令出必行，而且行得一定澈底。</p>

<p>都市的夜，就在燈光，我們爲什麼不從積極地充裕電力作起呢？且又明知消極取締不能完全辦到，又何必多此一舉呢？</p>

<h3 id="c174">中國究有多少人　從增設人口調查局說起 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>報載我政府當局，現計劃在內政部以下，增設人口調查局，最近可吿成立。這是我們期待已久的一個好消息。</p>
<p>中國的人口究竟有多少？所謂四萬五千萬，不過是一個估數字，有失精確。至於性別，十齡，職業的分別，除一地一時，片斷零碎的記載以外，全國人民的情形，竟不得而知，人口普査，從來不曾舉行過，試翻開一册國際的統計書籍，大半項目中，我國是沒有統計數字列入的。這是國家的一個恥辱。</p>
<p>民國二十五年六月，「中國統計學社」舉行年會，討論提案時，曾通過建議政府從速組織全國戶口編查統計的執行機構。可是遲遲未見實現。</p>
<p>各國政府，遠在十數年前，已有「人口統計局」的設立，專門負責執行調査統計本國的戶口事宜。大約每隔十年，重行調査一次。</p>
<h3 id="c175">看看人家 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>

<p>土耳其政府常一九二七年，曾舉行全國戶口調査，到了一九四〇年十月，再度舉行，從事這項工作的，計有公務員二十萬人，實行按戶調査。執行時，全國人民和旅居的外僑，一律居家十小時，不得外出，居民如違令出外，處罰款或監禁，遇急症，生產等事，須經警署轉達，一切交通車輛，都暫時停止行駛，商店，飯肆，旅館全部停止營業，調査完畢，鳴砲爲號，民衆方才可以離開住宅。</p>
<p>蘇聯在一九三九年，舉行全聯邦人口總調査，從一月十七日開始，調査所需時間，城市七日，鄕村十日，爲了國境廣闊動用工作人員五十萬名，其中僅列寗格勒一地，即須用調査員一萬名，監察員一千五百名，這些工作人員，事前都經過特殊訓練。進行調査時，所有火車上，輪船及車站等處流動人口，一律同時加以統計。其中派往帕米爾高原，戈爾諾巴達山自治省的一個調査團，先三個月已經啓程前往該自治省，他們必須攀登高山絕嶺，冒了生命的危險，方才能够到達山上的某些村落。派到巴侖茨海岸和柯拉半島的調査員，更要乘了馴鹿，行一萬五千公里的長途。到卡拉更沙漠區域調査的工作人員，成立了十六個駱駝隊，方才可以完成任務。獨居偏僻地點的燈塔看守人以及人跡不到的地方探險家，都要一一加以調査統計。</p>
<p>其他各國如英，美，德，法，日本，過去舉行戶口調査，情形與蘇土兩國相仿，動員數十萬人，舉國行動一致，人民更處處以工作人員便利，所以得够獲得圓滿無疵的成果。</p>

<p>…烟民調驗所巡禮…</p>
<p>國土重光後，當局對於禁政，雷厲風行。現値調騐時期，各處普遍檢舉，如有嫌疑或經人吿發，一律送警察醫院調騐所調騐，無　交保開釋，有毒有癥，解地檢署法辦。凡自新登記烟民，依次抽騐。不才有十六年歷史的黑籍「情侶」，此次調騐結果，已經法律證明已脫離黑籍。從此新生活開始，爰撮經騐，留紀雪泥鴻爪。</p>
<p>不才自被傳進警局至保出前後計五日四夜。首夕，在警局內坐待天明，翌晨，又有被傳一人及嫌疑者蘇北難民三人，因來滬投親，不幸爲烟案被累。同日同時車送提籃橋上海市警察醫院調騐所，一進門須走五層樓梯，有癥老槍已覺氣喘吁吁矣，旣抵調騐所，依次訊問年籍曁吸烟原因數量，詳細報明後，再至第二間，須將衣袋中一切物件，盡數交出保管，並出立收據封存。再至第三間，有一警員抄査身上，衣服一一脫下，仔細檢騐，以防夾帶代癥品，襪子皮鞋帶褲帶不准權進。調騐所男女分東西兩間，所門前各有値班警員駐守，不才捧衣踏進所門，矚目所見，上中下三流人物，無不應有盡有，同居一室。在法律前，人人平等，方知自由的可愛。當時吾進所後，有一山東佬前來招呼：「老鄕，你也來啦嗎，歡迎歡迎，你把空的床舖躺下，在這兒靜養幾天，咱們談談交個患難朋友好麽」，吾對他點頭苦笑一下，就坐下穿衣，同時來者，也陸續走進，各找空舖，吾正向四面呆視，發現大名鼎鼎唱滑稽的裴揚華也在此處。他是同日老閘區送來的，不多時外面開夜飯進來，每人床前小桌上有一碗一筷，先送小菜，規定每人一碟，但有力者搶得兩碟。菜是蘿蔔湯，飯是洋　米，向吾攀談的山東佬，一連吃了六工碗，再留一工碗以備點心。他邊吃邊說：「他媽的，老子又不犯法，給抓了進來，有飯吃儘管吃，大家齊心預備吃得他開不出伙食，咱們也好早天出去啦！」山東佬津津有味的吃講，但我勉强吃罷一碗，再沒有勇氣添第二碗了。飯罷分開水，不到二小時，一位護士小姐手拿簿子進來，點名對號上床，於是大夥兒同病相憐的難友，上床無聊，開始談天投地。有的問長問短，有的鼾聲大作，將近十時，大家安眠。天色微明，大家起床、頭檔節目，摺疊絨　，每人坐床靜待配給坑票後，大家出恭的出恭，小便的小便，待漱口洗而畢，已六時，即早餐吃稀飯與大頭菜。第二檔節目，點名騐小便，每人二小瓶便罷，打手印封口。接着醫生前來對號査問，十一時開中飯，飯後第三檔節目，點名量量寒暑表，耙錄脈搏。先來者如點不着名，便有出去的可能性。下午烟民烟犯，進來的也有，出去的也有，直到晚上整天的節目又過丟了。在所中生活，並不覺得寂寞，因爲對過法院每日審問案件，可望而不可聽，又可看隔壁監獄內廣塲上的犯人，那兒有日俘與白俄猶太人等戰犯，在星頂空地上排球遊戲。大家無聊時，又可聽裴揚華講故事，以資消遣。好容易挨到第五天，吾與×××同有出院的希望，不料下午傳×出去問話回來時，大喊「倒霉」不止。問其何故？搖頭嘆息道：「今天不能出去了，因有人在小報上說我什麽什麽，不曉得是捧捧我還是害害我呢」。四時左右傳吾等出去交與原來警員，先將褲帶襪子發還穿好，然後領取封存之物，回轉原警局交保歸來，還各自由。這是否生命史中最偉大而且最有價値的一頁。不可無紀，乃撰調騐所經歷紀，以實自由談，永作紀念云爾。</p>

<p>我們現在用的曆法（陽曆）是多麽麻煩啊！什麽，二月是二十八天哩！七月和八月連着是三十一天哩，攪七廿三使人頭痛，你別急，科學家們替我們發明一種「科學曆法」。它是這樣計算的。把一年分爲十三個月，每個月二十八天。你又要問：三八二十四，二三得六……，祗有三百六十四天　！還有一天怎麼辦呢？啊！科學家們早已替我們想好了，多餘的一天旣不屬於一九四六，也不屬於一九四七，它是獨立的我們姑且叫他「快樂的日子」。那一天全世界放假在歡慶祝新年的將來臨，這是計算的方法。還有他的好處慢慢的聽我道來。</p>

<p>— 疾風</p>
<p>不自殞滅</p>
<p>吳稚老的筆調，是向以潑辣善屬出名的。汪逆附敵時，吳氏第一個著文痛罵，爽辣無以復加，屬得汪逆體無完膚。他又曾和章行嚴氏大開筆戰，竟來了一道替章氏報喪的訃聞，原文是這樣的：『不友吳敬恒等，罪孽深重，不自殞滅，禍延敝友學士府君，府君生於前甲寅，痛於後甲寅，無疾而終。不友等親視含殮，遵古心喪，氈（非苦）塊昏迷，不便多說，哀此訃聞。」並附數語云：『所謂罪孽深重者，乃紀實，因一般朋友不長進，於國事不能積極前進，弄得章先生悲憤無聊，走頭無路，從而反去走進牛角裏灣到十八層團谷也。』可謂極盡挖苦的能事。</p>
<p>十分坦白</p>
<p>他的演說，也是滑稽突梯，口沒遮攔。有一次，南京召開大會，請吳氏演說。吳氏姗姗來遲，登台就說：『我昨天晚上與老妻敦倫一次，所以今天精神很疲乏，來得晚了，請諸位原諒！』台下爲之哄堂。吳聽從蔣主席赴漢口時，武漢各界舉行大會歡迎，吳氏代表蔣主席演說，時天氣酷熱，吳稚老開口便說：『我昨天晚上，一覺醒來，發現我的褲子都濕透了，起初我疑爲××了，但是沒有做混帳夢，後來才知道是大汗。』</p>
<p>吳氏的生性詼諧，已從上面可見到一斑，但因此常開罪於人。某次敎育部開讀音統一會時，與王樸忽起爭執，王氏口吃性燥，理由又不充分，破口大罵吳氏：『老王八旦，只知嘻皮笑臉，何嘗懂得語音學？敢來和老子一爭短長？』語極難堪，全堂愕然失色。而吳氏從容起立笑着說：『王先生錯了！也許是氣昏了吧？稚輝姓吳，非貴本家也！』全堂人士不禁爲之哄然大笑。</p>
<p>著作甚多</p>
<p>吳氏通英法德日四國文字，著述甚富。著名的有「上下古今談」，「天演學圖解」，「荒占原人史」，「　　客座談話」，「吳稚輝全集」等書。辛亥革命後，在法國與蔡元培，李石曾，張靜江等組織留法儉學會，發行世界畫報，翻譯反抗帝國主義的名劇。民國十三年，主編的科學週報，每期都有吳氏的文章，主張以科學救國，反對讀綫裝書</p>

<h3 id="e1">Representatives Proceed Carefully with Gradual Peace Talks; Three Days Yield Optimism; Cessation of Propaganda Warfare Under Discussion <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 23rd] As peace talks progress, the third party, feeling that provocative propaganda hinders the progress of discussions, decided in last night's meeting to suggest a truce in propaganda. This was agreed upon by both sides and announced at a press conference, hoping that journalists would assist in solemnly recording peace talk news to help the progress of the negotiations. At 9:00 AM on the 23rd, the Democratic League held a meeting at Zhang Junmai's residence in Baotai Street to discuss opinions on mediation, which ended at 11:00 AM. In the afternoon at 1:00 PM, government representatives Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Wu Dingchang, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Zhang Lisheng, Peng Xuepei, etc., gathered at the Lixing Society for a meal to discuss everything; and elected Sun Ke and Wang Shijie to exchange views with the third party again at 6:30 PM in the afternoon. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the entire third party held a meeting at the Jiaotong Bank to discuss in detail all issues related to the peace talks, which ended at 6:30 PM in the afternoon. After dinner, they went to Sun Ke's residence at 7:00 PM in the afternoon to study the implementation of the propaganda truce with Sun Ke, Wang Shijie, Peng Xuepei, Lei Zhen, etc., and appointed Shao Lizi and Peng Xuepei as representatives of the government side, and Liang Shuming and Li Huang as representatives of the third party. It was decided that on the morning of the 24th at 10:00 AM, the third party would visit the Communist Party again to invite them to send representatives to discuss. It seems that the propaganda truce method may be drafted and implemented immediately. In the midst of the call for a propaganda truce, the CCP representative has already hung up a "no battle" sign. Spokesperson Mei Yi left a note in Fu Dashil's office, which only read: "No news today. Mei Yi" seven words. The government side also strictly restricted news reporters from making any statements, which is already a prelude to the propaganda truce. It is also heard that representatives of various parties have been in Nanjing for three days. Judging from the situation of the three days, it has indeed improved compared to the past. The details of some issues are already under study. Regarding the issue of a ceasefire in place, the third party has already stated its agreement. As long as the Communist Party no longer insists on its preconceived notions, there is great hope for the issuance of a ceasefire order. Li Huang returned to Nanjing from Shanghai at 10:00 AM in the morning. According to Li, everything is progressing and is much more optimistic than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Situ Meitang, chairman of the Minzhi Party, visited Zhou Enlai, Li Weihan, Zhang Junmai, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Luo Longji, Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Chen Lifu, and Hu Lin on the 23rd to advise all parties to work together to achieve peaceful unification.</p>
<p>Also, social figures Hu Lin, Qian Yongming, and Yang Yongjun of the Youth Party took a car to Shanghai on the evening of the 23rd. It is heard that the three will return to Nanjing within two or three days.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Minister Peng Receives Reporters; Chennault's Air Transport Team is Only a Part of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration; National Assembly Will Not Be Postponed; List to be Released Soon <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 23rd] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at the Central Daily News Auditorium at 4:00 PM on the 23rd. The following is a record of his answers to reporters' questions: Question: What is the actual situation of the air transport team formed by Chennault? Answer: The air transport team led by Chennault is part of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, with twelve aircraft allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and funds paid by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, totaling one million yuan. Chennault and Wei Laoer serve as captain and deputy captain respectively. The main task of the team is to transport relief supplies and to end the team's work on the day the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration ends. At the same time, it does not compete with the China National Aviation Corporation in business and does not engage in commercial goods, but only uses spare tonnage to transport government supplies and returning personnel. It is not an airline. Question: Recently, the third party suggested a cessation of propaganda warfare. What is the government's opinion? Answer: Since Chairman Chiang clarified the eight points, the government has had no propaganda. On the 19th of this month, the second page of the Central Daily News published a CCP document on one side and an editorial on China's food problem on the other side, without publishing any debate on their document. Currently, they often broadcast from Yan'an, verbally abusing the government, which is completely disrespectful. Question: It was previously heard that the list of National Assembly representatives would be released on the 22nd, but it has been delayed. What is the reason? Answer: The list of National Assembly representatives will be released soon. Question: If there is progress in the peace talks, will the National Assembly be postponed? Answer: It will not be postponed.</p>
<p>Question: What are the details of the Sino-Soviet Aviation Corporation? Answer: The Sino-Soviet Aviation Corporation was officially established in December 1939, with a contract signed by the Ministry of Communications and the Central Administration of Civil Aviation of the Soviet government to jointly organize it. The head office was established in Dihua, specializing in the air transport business from Xinjiang, Hami, via Dihua, Yili, to Almaty in the Soviet Union, a total length of 1,415 kilometers. The flight time takes about six hours. The chairman of the company is the Chinese Liu Zherong, the general manager is the Russian Vorobiov Yotian, and the assistant manager is the Chinese Li Rutong. There are currently three "DC3" transport aircraft. It is heard that west of Almaty, it is connected to the route to Moscow, and it is connected to the route of the China National Aviation Corporation in Hami. From January to July of this year, the company flew a total of 102,003 kilometers, carrying 53,664 passengers, 11,392 kilograms of mail, and 49,486 kilograms of cargo. Question: What is your impression of the military situation? Answer: The military situation in various places is generally tending towards peace, but the Communist army in Shaanxi is still attacking Yulin.</p>

<p>[This City Dispatch] After returning to Shanghai, Chen Jiakang, the CCP spokesman in Shanghai, made his first statement as follows: (1) The informal talks continued in Nanjing on the 21st and 22nd, still following the "talk-stop talk" procedure. (2) As of the evening of the 22nd, representatives from the government and the CCP had no direct talks other than meeting at banquets. Therefore, the third party representatives maintained contact with the government and CCP representatives separately, with the aim of discovering problems and finding the location of the continuation. (3) The negotiation procedure proposed by the government's statement on October 16th requires the CCP to agree to the eight points first, then talk, then stop. The CCP has repeatedly stated that it cannot accept this.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 23rd] Xinhe Station on the Beining Line was attacked by the Communist army yesterday. The Pinggu Line between Huairou and Miyun was once destroyed by the Communist army on the morning of the 23rd. There are 3,000 Communist troops 15 li east of Yundong, preparing to attack.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Beiping Military Authorities Ordered to Issue a Halt-Advance Order; National Army on the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway Will Soon Join Forces <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 23rd] The military authorities here were ordered to issue a halt-advance order to the current combat troops last night, maintaining the strongholds currently held. According to a certain important person, the government, in order to express its greatest determination for peace, first restrained itself from military actions that would hinder peaceful negotiations. The more important battlefield now is the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. The launch of this battlefield was entirely due to the Communist army. Even so, the National Army on that side has been ordered to suspend its frontal attack.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 23rd] After recovering Laishui, west of Gaobeidian on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, Yixian was recovered again yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 23rd] National trains between Ping and Bao on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway will soon join forces. The Communist army at the stations along the line, due to their weakness, retreated before the National Army arrived, so although the National trains have made rapid progress in recent days, they have not encountered frontal resistance from the Communist army. The National Army advancing southward searched and advanced along both sides of the railway, and has crossed Beihe Shop and arrived at Gucheng. The Communist army in Beihe Shop had already withdrawn. The National Army advancing northward from Baoding has also crossed the Fu River and is pressing on Xushui, only about 50 li apart from the National Army advancing southward. It seems that the Pingbao section can be restored without fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 23rd] The National trains advancing southward along the Pinghan Railway have overcome the strong resistance of the Communist army and recovered Laishui on the 20th. The Communist army surrounding Xincheng heard the news and fled. The area between Gaobeidian and Xincheng has now been cleared. Sun Tingbi, the newly appointed magistrate of Xushui County on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, and Xie Xinlin, the magistrate of Dingxing County, will lead administrative personnel to advance with the army to carry out county administration work.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The vanguard of the National Army advancing southward on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has crossed Gucheng Town. Also, several thousand Communist troops who were routed from Zhangjiakou, on the 18th, appeared in San Yan Village, northwest of Zhuozhou County. Some of them have surrendered to the National Army, and some have fled in two directions to Laiyuan and Yuxian.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 23rd] The issue of whether there is a time limit for reporting traitors has attracted much attention from all parties. The general opinion is that if a reporting period is clearly defined, traitors can easily escape punishment. Some people also believe that if the public is allowed to freely report traitors for a long time, there will be more abuses and disputes. It is learned that the central government has discussed this and has decided to set a deadline for public reporting, but the court reporting period will not be restricted. This method will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for drafting.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch of the 23rd] The National Army on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is advancing southward at full speed, and the Baoding garrison has also sent troops northward. According to reliable sources, traffic between Ping and Bao can be opened within three days. The railway has been severely damaged by the Communist army, and it will take a considerable amount of time to repair it and restore traffic.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 23rd] The main force of the Communist army in the Chahar region has moved south from Zhuolu. Nie Rongzhen's headquarters has now moved to Fuping, and its main task is to destroy the Pinghan Railway. According to official sources, Nie Rongzhen recently convened a meeting of senior cadres from the military region and military sub-regions to decide that the fourth, thirteenth, and ninth sub-regions would be responsible for destroying the Pingbao section, and the second, fifth, and seventh military sub-regions would be responsible for destroying the Baoshi section.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 23rd] According to official intelligence, the movements of the Communist army in the Baoding area are as follows: The Communist army in Yujiazhuang South via Yangyi area has been transferred to Ding County. More than 3,000 Communist troops from Jicheng moved west on the 20th. The town now has an independent regiment of more than 1,000 people.

<h3 id="e28">Traitor Luo Junqiang Was Tried Yesterday: His Account of the Inside Story of Eliminating Traitor Li Shiqun's Gang Was Vivid and Detailed, His Face Full of Treacherous Smiles, a Complete Clown <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Bureau on the 23rd] Luo Junqiang, the Secretary-General of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, was tried at the Capital Higher Court on the 23rd. Luo, with his calm demeanor and eloquent speech, chattered and quibbled for four hours, often showing lighthearted and treacherous smiles, and glancing around with his goldfish eyes behind his spectacles, a complete clownish traitor. At 1:30 PM, Luo was brought to the court from the Tiger Bridge Detention Center. At 2:35 PM, Judge Luo Yunxie, Ge Zhaodong, and Li Huaian, Prosecutor Wang Wenjun, Court Clerk Chen Xiping, and defense lawyers Wang Shanxiang and Xue Songqi (Wang Hengyi was absent) took their seats. First, traitor You Yizhao was brought up and sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and confiscation of property. After being returned to custody, at 2:45 PM, Luo was brought to the court, wearing a new blue cloth gown and yellow leather shoes, and wearing eyeglasses with yellow rims. He stood in the defendant's dock, and Presiding Judge Luo asked him questions. Luo's statement went as follows: "Luo Junqiang, 45 years old, from Xiangxiang, Hunan. I studied at Great China University and Datong College in Shanghai, but did not graduate. I have only one wife and one son at home. My assets in Shanghai are only furniture and other items, which have been registered and handed over to the Military Statistics Bureau. I had a residence in Nanjing, but it was destroyed in the war in 1937. The house and land were mortgaged to the bank, and the loan has not yet been repaid (at the same time, he presented a bank receipt). In 1926, I entered society and worked in a small unit under the Commander-in-Chief. From 1936 to 1938, I served as a secretary of the Executive Yuan. In December 1938, I left my position due to personnel issues and planned to engage in cultural work overseas (such as newspapers). Later, due to illness, I stayed in Kunming and Hong Kong, where I met Zhou Fohai. Based on our personal relationship, I was invited to help. In August 1939, I arrived in Shanghai and began participating in the puppet government, serving as a puppet official. Until January 15, 1945, I arrived in Shanghai and took office as the Secretary-General of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government. I was then granted permission by the authorities to assist Zhou Fohai in carrying out defection work."</p>
<p>Participating in the Puppet Organization: Claiming Traitor Zhou Dragged Him Down</p>
<p>Luo insisted that his participation in the "Peace Movement" began after meeting Zhou in Hong Kong, and that he knew nothing about the conspiracy of Mei (Siping), Gao (Zongwu), Wang (Jingwei), and Zhou (Fohai). After becoming a puppet official, considering his personal education and history, he immediately realized that he had made a big mistake. Now, before the court representing the country, he frankly spoke his conscience and deeply condemned himself. However, after realizing his mistake, he thought that it would be meaningless to retreat or commit suicide. Since he had entered the tiger's den, he had to get the tiger's cubs, so he decided to do something to repay the national leader.</p>
<p>Luo described his relationship with Zhou Fohai, saying: "When Zhou was a professor, I was a student. A paternal uncle of mine was Zhou's close friend. I have always worked under Zhou's supervision, from clerk to secretary-general to secretary. Because I am a generation lower than him, others do not understand and think that I have a deep relationship with Zhou, that I must know about his affairs and participate in them. In fact, I only do what he wants me to do. If he doesn't want me to take care of something, I can't rush to take care of it. I am too emotional. To help him, I worked on the tax police corps and turned my hair white. I lost half my life."</p>
<p>Running the Tax Police Corps: He Actually Greatly Praised His "Merits"</p>
<p>Luo repeatedly praised his "merits" in running the tax police corps, saying that this armed force was established through five years of painstaking efforts, from the cracks of friction between the enemy and the puppet government, in order to "serve the country." "Since 1940, we started running the tax police school, cultivating a special spirit and education, and a special mission. When we started the tax police, we didn't have a single soldier or a single gun. We built it up to more than 20,000 people and more than 10,000 guns, and a considerable number of heavy weapons, preserving them under the enemy's suspicion until victory, and handing them all over to the central government without daring to claim credit."</p>
<p>Luo became even more excited when describing his "committing crimes and rendering meritorious service," saying: Since taking office in the puppet government in 1939, he had been looking for opportunities to be loyal to the central government, not changing his allegiance after seeing the wind. In 1942, he established contact with Cheng Kexiang, in 1944 he established contact with Zhang Shuping, and in 1945, in Shanghai, he contacted Japanese anti-war elements, advocated to General Okamura Yasuji the withdrawal of the dispatch army, rescued General Li Mingyang and more than a dozen of his subordinates, and organized the "National Construction Society" to contact "comrades" to carry out defection work, and so on.</p>
<p>Poisoning Li Shiqun: Describing the Process with Great Zeal</p>
<p>Then, lawyer Wang Zuxiang requested the court to inquire about the fact that he had followed the central government's order to eliminate traitor Li Shiqun, the "76th" devil, the head of the puppet intelligence agency. Luo described it with even more effort, with great zeal, like a storyteller. Luo said: "This matter began in the early summer of 1944. After receiving the order from the central government through Cheng Kexiang, I consulted with Zhou Fohai to proceed. I then cooperated with Xiong Jiandong to devise various possible methods to eliminate Li Shiqun, even secretly surveying the terrain necessary for the operation. However, we all felt uneasy and finally decided to start by alienating his relationship with the Japanese, in order to kill him with a borrowed knife. I first fired a shot at a certain tax police school anniversary week, attacking Li heavily. At the same time, Xiong Jiandong worked on the Japanese side. After three or four months of brewing, the opportunity matured in late August. On the evening of September 3, Xiong told me: 'It's done!' The next day, Japanese senior intelligence officer Lieutenant Colonel Okamura came forward and hosted a dinner at his residence, ostensibly to resolve a dispute over a glass of wine, inviting Li and Xiong. In order to avoid attracting attention with his yellow car, he took my black car to the dinner. Li arrived last. Okamura introduced her as a so-called new unofficial wife from Japan, and said that she would cook, but Li was very cunning and didn't drink a drop of wine. But in the end, the female agent and Xiong's wife cleverly devised a plan, placing poison in the ice cream and iced coffee, so that Li took the poison. The poison was purchased from the Japanese Marines at a high price. It had no color or taste, but had to be used in cold drinks. After entering the stomach, even washing the stomach would not cure it, and he would die within a few days. It was heard that after the banquet, Li was very suspicious of the over-friendly attitude of everyone at the table, and he dug his throat with his fingers and vomited everything, but because the poison was extremely potent, he finally died on the 8th. Afterwards, Wang went from suspecting me to hating me. If he hadn't gone to Tokyo for medical treatment, the tax police corps would not have been preserved." When Luo described this inside story, he was animated, gesticulating, and everyone in the audience was moved by his vivid description and his sinister and vicious style for a long time.</p>
<p>Later, witnesses Zhang Shuping (former liaison officer of the Third War Area in Nanjing and Shanghai, who was ordered by the Army Headquarters to testify) and Man Yiqi (puppet Shanghai Police Chief, currently detained in the Nanhai Road Detention Center in Nanjing) were questioned, separately explaining the intelligence liaison between Zhou and Luo and the Third War Area, and the inside story of the "National Construction Society." Finally, defense lawyer Wang Shanxiang requested that attention be paid to the investigation of evidence, and submitted documentary evidence from Li Mingyang, Jiang Bocheng, Wu Shaoshu, Li Pinxian, Gu Zhutong, and Dai Li to the court. At 5:30 PM, the court clerk read the court transcript. At 6:00 PM, the presiding judge announced that the preliminary trial was completed and scheduled a new trial. Luo was led back to his prison cell.</p>
<p>Chen Junhui's Retrial</p>
<p>Lawyers Presented Favorable Evidence: The Next Hearing Will Open for Debate</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Bureau on the 23rd] Chen Junhui was retried at the Capital Higher Court at 9:30 AM on the 23rd. Chen was wearing wrinkled clothes and disheveled hair, looking extremely disheveled. Judge Cui Yucang and Court Clerk Xu Changsheng took the stand, asking him a few questions. Defense lawyer Wu Chuanyi presented five pieces of favorable evidence. Then, witnesses Wang Mingyu, Hui Taosheng, Lin Xisheng, and Liu Junrui were questioned, separately stating that Chen, while serving as the puppet Minister of Industry, negotiated with the Japanese to protect small yarn factories and return silk factory machinery, and that he issued overseas Chinese loans while serving as the chairman of the puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The court then announced that there was no other evidence and that the next hearing would open for debate and could not be delayed under any pretext. The court adjourned at 11:30 AM, and the defendant was returned to custody. Chen's case has been delayed for a long time. The Higher Court originally intended to conclude the case on the 23rd, but because Chen was cunning, it changed it back to an extended investigation hearing.</p>

Since the start of work, the Garrison Headquarters has been responsible for the area south of the Yangtze River, east to Shanghai, south to Dangtu, and along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Nanjing-Hangzhou national highways. In Shanghai, it is also under the command of Commander Tang, and although the situation is complex, the situation has improved in recent months thanks to the efforts of Commander Xuan Tiewu. Along the Nanjing-Shanghai line, the headquarters has established a command post in Wuxi for ease of command. Taihu Lake and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area are all under its jurisdiction. It is currently conducting suppression work in nine zones. Before November, there were still more than 8,000 bandits in the area. After suppression and recruitment in November, there are less than 1,000 remaining. The command post also cooperates with the Jiangsu Provincial Government to reorganize the Baojia system, organize road protection teams, strengthen the communications network, and reward informants to strengthen self-defense forces. In terms of security in the capital, at the beginning of the return to the capital, the nationwide production and transportation had not yet fully recovered. At the same time, the number of returning institutions increased daily, and the population increased daily. All of these affected security. However, since the establishment of the headquarters, everything has improved. The work carried out by the headquarters in the capital includes the following: (1) Public order, including maintaining order at stations and docks; (2) Traffic control, the number of car accidents in Nanjing has decreased; (3) Accommodation of stray soldiers, so far, about 140 to 150 people have been accommodated; (4) Accommodation of vagrants and beggars, so far, more than 120 people have been accommodated; (5) Railway traffic order, the general order along the Nanjing-Shanghai line has improved in the past two months thanks to the efforts of the military and police, and the number of soldiers riding without tickets has also decreased; (6) Handling of theft cases, 27 cases have been solved in the past few months, and the number of banditry cases has decreased; (7) Maintaining waterway traffic between Nanjing and Wuhu, four robbery cases have been solved successively; (8) Strengthening street patrols; (9) Preliminary preparation work for the organization of the Nanjing people has been completed, and the personnel of the cadre training class can also be assigned to various groups next month. It is expected that the organization can begin at the end of this month; (10) Temporary security.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Revision of the Academia Sinica Organizational Law: Councilors Must Be Elected by Academicians in the Future: Regulations on Doctoral Degree Examinations Submitted for Review <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Third Annual Meeting of the Second Council of Academia Sinica held a "Academician" Review Committee at 9:30 AM on the 23rd in the auditorium of Academia Sinica. The attendees were Fu Sinian, Hu Shi, and ten others, with Hu Shi as the chairman. Because the "Academician" issue involves the organizational law greatly, the specific details of this issue are to amend the organizational law. After discussion, the review opinions were listed and submitted to the fifth plenary session in the afternoon for discussion. The plenary session was held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and Chairman Zhu Jiahua announced the discussion of the "Academician" and the review opinions of the Research Institute Organizational Law Review Committee. The amendments were passed, and six articles were added after Article 4 of the original Academia Sinica Organizational Law. The general meaning of these six articles is: (1) Academia Sinica shall establish academicians; (2) In the future, councilors must be elected by academicians and then appointed by the National Government; (3) The powers of academicians: Academia Sinica academicians shall be produced from the following three groups of sciences: 1. Mathematical Sciences Group (including mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, meteorology, geology, paleontology, mineralogy and petrology, geography, oceanography, engineering) 2. Biological Sciences Group (including zoology, botany, anthropology, physiology, psychology, microbiology, medicine, pharmacology, agronomy). 3. Humanities and Social Sciences Group (including philosophy, history, linguistics, archeology, law, economics, political science, ethnology). The second central issue was the examination rules and awarding methods for doctoral degrees. Each council member spoke enthusiastically. As a result, due to the importance of the issue, Hu Shi, Zhou Gengsheng (representing the mainland faction), Bing Zhi, Luo Zongluo, He Lian, Qian Yunong, Wang Zhongji, Wu Huayu, Chen Yuan, and Weng Wenhao were recommended as members of the small review committee to review it. Then, the division of academic matters between the council and the Ministry of Education's Academic Review Committee, and four other cases related to bonuses, were discussed, and Zhou Ren, Ling Hongxun, Lin Kesheng, Zhang Yun, Tang Cheng, Xie Jiarong, Lu Jiong, and Wu Dingliang were recommended as members of the small review committee. Reports on the work of each institute and other regulations were submitted to the small work review committee that was established yesterday for review. The review committees will meet at 9:30 AM tomorrow morning, and the sixth plenary session will be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. It is expected that the most heatedly debated topic at tomorrow afternoon's plenary session will be the issue of doctoral degree examination rules. The awarding of doctoral degrees is still considered an innovation in our country, so experts are seeking to make it reasonable in the spirit of scientific research.</p>

<h3 id="e36">The Largest in Asia: A Tour of the Xiaofengman Power Plant: Six Generators Transported Away by Soviet Troops: Total Loss Valued at More Than 45.6 Billion Circulation Notes <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Wang Wanjun, Jilin, 23rd] The Songhua River Power Plant (i.e., Xiaofengman), which was painstakingly operated by the enemy and puppet government for eight years but has not yet been fully completed, is the largest in Asia. It originally had eight synchronous magnetic turbine and generator units with a power generation capacity of 70,000 kVA. Its maximum power output during the flood season was 560,000 kWh per day, and it could generate 2.4 billion kWh per year. When the Ministry of Economic Affairs took over the plant on June 11 this year, the Soviets had already dismantled six generators, leaving two. After reorganization, power is generated and transmitted by three transformer units with a capacity of 70,000 kVA at a voltage of 154,000 volts, supplying power to major cities and factory towns such as Changchun, Jilin, Shenyang, and Fushun. During the four months of the takeover, the maximum power generation reached 100,000 kWh per day. Now that the line north to Harbin is not open, only 40,000 kWh are generated per day. When the Changchun Municipal Reporter Group visited today, they saw this huge hydroelectric project on the Songhua River and deeply felt the need to introduce the plant's equipment to the people of the country in detail, as it is the driving force for our future development of all resources in Northeast China. The plant is located in Fengman Town, 24 kilometers upstream of the Songhua River north of Jilin City. It has a reservoir with an area of 550 square kilometers and a depth of 74 meters, and a large dam 1,100 meters long and 91 meters high, longer than the planned Yangyu'an (Y.V.A) floodgate. In addition to two turbine units of 85,000 kW and two units of 3,000 kW, there are also eight synchronous magnetic turbine generators with a power generation capacity of 70,000 kVA, and five transformer units of 70,000 kVA, now only three remain. The power used by the important cities and industrial areas in Northeast China is supplied by the four main transmission lines: Songchang (Fengman to Changchun, Siping, and Xi'an), Songfu (Fengman to Fushun), Songha (Fengman to Harbin), and Songhua (Fengman to Jilin). According to Shen Jun, the specialist dispatched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to take over the plant, the Soviets not only dismantled six generators, but also transported away about 40% of the plant's construction tools and more than 80% of the electrical materials, resulting in huge losses. Taking the six generators that were dismantled as an example, they are worth 45.6 billion Northeast circulation notes (7.6 billion per unit). As for the dam project, the total amount of concrete is 1.92 million cubic meters, and 1.72 million cubic meters have been completed. The highest water level of the reservoir is 262 meters, and the height of the existing dam is 259 meters. 200,000 cubic meters of concrete must be completed this year, otherwise, the thawing of ice in the spring will cause floods to cross the dam, and more than a dozen counties along the river in Jilin Province will be in danger of being submerged. The plant was taken over by the Resources Commission on October 1. When Dekasun (American), the chief engineer of the National Hydropower Engineering Administration of the Resources Commission, came here to inspect, he suggested that the Fengman Power Plant should restore one more generator in the future, because the daily power generation before the victory was about 190,000 kilowatts and the three units could generate 210,000 kilowatts. The plant has 1,700 employees, currently 1,300, including 350 Japanese technicians who are retained. A total of 881 Japanese employees and their families have been repatriated.</p>
<h3 id="e37">The Declining State of Industry and Mining in Jiangxi: Light Industry Suffers Wartime Damage and Struggles to Recover; Crude Extraction Methods Limit Tungsten and Coal Production <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang dispatch of the 22nd] The state of industry and mining in Jiangxi province has steadily declined since the war. Factories under the jurisdiction of the provincial government and the Xingye Company, a four-party joint venture, such as power plants in Nanchang, Ji'an, Ganxian, and other counties, are struggling due to outdated equipment. Power supply is inadequate, with Ji'an experiencing electricity so poor it is inferior to oil lamps, leading to the widespread use of gas lamps. While Ganxian enjoys a relatively better power supply, electricity bills are over one-third higher than those in Nanchang. Other factories, such as those producing alcohol, dyeing materials, and textiles, have ceased operations and are facing irreversible decline. According to insiders, the slight development of light industry in Jiangxi during the war was made possible by using funds from the central government's purchase of tin ore. However, relocation during the war and the scorched-earth policy employed by the retreating Japanese troops resulted in widespread destruction. Now, with limited capital and high labor costs, resuming operations is impossible. Privately-owned factories are also collapsing. The tungsten mines of Southern Jiangxi Grand Building are currently dormant. The Special Mineral Products Management Office of the National Resources Commission employs only slightly over one hundred workers in the area, producing approximately one "shi dan" (approx. 50 kg) per day. However, local people registered with the office for independent mining produce roughly one hundred "shi dan" per day, sold at 1.8 million yuan per ton. This mining is done using primitive methods, and the miners' living standards have declined compared to the past. Three American experts are currently in the area to investigate and design new extraction methods. Furthermore, the Zihe coal mine, which has low-quality coal, is currently being mined by hand, producing approximately three tons daily. There are over 30,000 tons of coal currently stockpiled, but transportation is difficult due to shallow waters and many shoals. The Fengcheng coal mine is privately-owned and operated by over ten companies. The coal quality is excellent, with a daily output of approximately three hundred tons. However, inconvenient access to the mine and high costs are impacting production at various mines and contributing to the current coal shortage in Nanchang.</p>

<h3 id="e43">The Convening of the Academia Sinica Council <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The third session of the second Academia Sinica Council convened in the capital on the 21st, bringing together scholars of international renown. Our Chairman, concerned with the advancement of academic research, issued special instructions to encourage them. At the same time, Education Minister Zhu Jia骅, in his opening remarks, announced the recent decision of the National Defense Supreme Council, stating that the percentage of the national budget allocated to scientific research should be increased, thereby providing a more solid foundation for academic research in our country. Under the current turbulent circumstances, the convening of such a high-level academic conference is indeed gratifying.</p>
<p>Our country has always regarded itself as an ancient civilization that values scholarship. However, in the past three to five decades, although our country has not lacked outstanding talents in academic research, the atmosphere for academic research has generally declined in recent years. The reasons for this are complex. In the field of science, the achievements of geologists such as the late Ding Wenjiang, Weng Wenhao, and Li Siguang, and paleontologists such as Yang Zhongjian and mathematicians such as Hua Luogeng, have gained international recognition. However, even in the fields of geology, paleontology, and mathematics, the decline in general research activity in recent years is undeniable. The situation is similar in the humanities, but the crisis is even more profound. It goes without saying that the achievements of the French sinologist Paul Pelliot in the field of Chinese studies surpass those of previous generations. However, the study of Chinese culture in the Netherlands, England and the United States is also quite impressive. For example, the collection of biographical sketches of famous figures from the Qing Dynasty compiled and printed by the Library of Congress is impressive in its scope and rigorous in its use of sources. In contrast, our country's research on its own culture and history has declined, which is a cause for concern. We hope that the convening of this high-level academic council will raise the atmosphere and enthusiasm for academic research in our country.</p>
<p>The Academia Sinica is the highest academic research institution in our country. In terms of its organization, it is directly under the National Government, and its position is extremely high. Its Western name, Academia Sinica, appears to be similar to the Académie Française; however, the mission of the Academia Sinica is not entirely the same as that of the Académie Française. In the Chairman's instructions to the Academia Sinica, he stated: "We should regularly inform the people that 'without science, there is no national defense.' In light of the reasons for the victory or defeat in this World War, the importance of scientific research is even more evident. As the only academic research institution in the capital, the Council is also responsible for promoting cooperation and mutual assistance in academic research at home and abroad. In the future, how to strengthen academic research in our country, especially how to explore the latest inventions in international science, and strive to catch up and keep pace with advanced countries, all depend on the consistent efforts of the Council to catch up...". It can be seen that the mission of the Academia Sinica is not only to promote academic research but also to strengthen our national defense. During the war, the United States mobilized scientists across the country to devote themselves to scientific research and established an organization under the federal government to specialize in scientific research. Although the war has ended, this scientific research organization still exists. It seems that the Academia Sinica, at least in the natural sciences, should assume the same task.</p>
<p>In the current situation of declining research activity, there seem to be two misleading views that need to be corrected as soon as possible. First, some people overemphasize applied science and ignore the importance of pure science. In their eyes, they believe that it is sufficient to study applied science and that pure science need not be valued. However, how can there be applications of science without research in pure science? Twenty years ago, if it were not for the research in pure physics at Cambridge University, the advent of the atomic age would probably not have occurred so early, or at least it would have been delayed for many years. Therefore, we should correct the erroneous view of emphasizing applied science. Second, some people believe that scientific research should be carried out without any purpose, but only for the sake of science. If scientific research has purposes other than science, such as for national defense, it may arouse a kind of aversion, as if one's own worth has been diminished. This is also an erroneous view. Not to mention the scientists of the Soviet Union, even the scientists of countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, their scientific research is also closely related to the needs of national defense. Scientists today can no longer lock themselves in laboratories and dream their dreams in ivory towers.</p>
<p>What we should particularly emphasize here is that scientific research that has no direct relationship with national defense, including research in the humanities, must not be neglected simply because it has no direct relationship with national defense. It is heard that the Cenozoic Research Institute, which is dedicated to the study of "Peking Man" and ancient humans in China, has been suspended due to insufficient funding, and that Pei Wenzhong, our country's paleontologist who is highly regarded worldwide, has been assigned to an idle position. We regret this loss of talent in China. As for others who have made great efforts in academic research, content to be obscure, and struggle on the poverty line, eventually dying of poverty and illness, such as the late Mr. Feng Chengjun, they are truly worthy of our admiration and sympathy. Now that the Academia Sinica Council is convening in Nanjing, we would like to appeal to them to pay attention to how to cherish talent, promote academic research in our country, and lay the academic foundation for national construction.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Deadline for Conscript Exemption Applications in Hangzhou; Lottery to Be Overseen by Mayor; Wuxi Requires One Soldier from Every Two Baos by Deadline <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou dispatch] Conscription has begun in the city, and all parties are paying close attention. As of yesterday, the deadline for applications for exemption from conscription and call-up had passed. The various baos will carefully investigate all applications today. The most pressing concern for citizens is the method of drawing lots for conscripts after review. The provincial authorities have drafted the plan, which is outlined as follows: The drawing of lots will be overseen by the county (city) magistrate in the county (city) government seat. Before the drawing of lots, the conscripts will be numbered, and the county (city) magistrate will place all the lots into the container. After shaking, the drawing will begin. After the drawing, the heads of the various agencies present will compile a roster in order of the drawn lot numbers.</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi dispatch of the 23rd] Since taking office, Cai Runqi, commander of the Wuxi Military Service District, has been actively promoting conscription in the three counties under his jurisdiction: Wuxi, Jiangyin, and Yixing. The Chengqu Office of this county convened a conscription meeting on the 22nd with the heads of 21 townships and baos in the Chengqu area. Commander Cai explained the military service laws and regulations, stating that Wuxi's first phase of conscription requires 900 soldiers, with one soldier for every two baos. Yixing requires 490 soldiers, and Jiangyin requires 580 soldiers, all to be completed by the end of this month. Those aged 18 to 20 will be national soldiers, trained locally by the county government. Those aged 21 to 45 will be regular soldiers, with conscription currently starting from ages 20 to 35. Soldiers entering service will receive 25 taels of white rice, one tael of pork, seven qian of bean oil, and seven qian of salt per day, along with soybeans and salted vegetables as side dishes. They will also receive a cotton quilt, a set of cotton clothing, two shirts, and a pair of shoes and socks. Special attention will be paid to education, training, and hygiene. Wuxi initially planned for volunteers, but due to difficulties in implementation, it has been decided to use a lottery system.</p>
<p>[Our Jintan dispatch] The county's first conscription quota is 250 soldiers, which has been allocated to various districts by the county government for collection by the deadline. Districts Four and Five have already collected and sent their quotas to the city, and the remaining districts are actively proceeding. The Chengqu area is divided into four towns, each town sending four conscripts. District Chief Lei personally supervises the drawing of lots at the town offices and stipulates that if a drawn conscript is an employee, the employer must continue to pay the original salary.</p>
<h3 id="e45">"Danbang" Traders Resurface; Both Railways Overcrowded; Seating Capacity Half of Actual Need <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Local report] Passenger congestion on both the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways has persisted for over a year and has worsened recently. According to our reporter's investigation, the reason is not a shortage of trains but a large number of passengers. Currently, the trains operating on both lines, such as the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, have over 160 northbound trains from Hangzhou to Shanghai North Station and over 230 southbound trains from Shanghai North Station to Hangzhou daily. The number of train trips has also increased compared to the past. The total seating capacity of all trains on both lines is only over 40,000, while the actual demand from passengers far exceeds that number. The new trains ordered from the United States should supplement capacity by next spring. However, current train usage is at its maximum, and the number of train trips cannot be further increased. The main reason for the large number of passengers is the increase in "danbang" traders. Merchants from various locations near Shanghai find that shipping by boat is slow, and transporting goods by train is both faster and cheaper due to low train fares, so they come to Shanghai to purchase goods themselves.</p>

<p>[Our Fuliang dispatch] The Jingdezhen-Nanchang highway, with a total length of 253 kilometers, is a vital transportation route from the northern interior of Jiangxi to the provincial capital. Although it was opened to traffic in August, there was no scheduled bus service due to a lack of vehicles. With the allocation of vehicles by the provincial highway administration, scheduled bus service has officially opened this month. Buses depart Jingdezhen for Nanchang on the 2nd and 7th of each month, with Wannian Huangjinbu as the halfway station. The total fare is 13,915 yuan (equivalent to 55 yuan per kilometer). The Jiangxi-Anhui highway connecting Jingdezhen to Qimen and Tunxi in southern Anhui is currently being constructed in sections by the highway administrations of both provinces and the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications. It is expected to be fully open to traffic this year.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Wuxi and Suzhou Shut Down Pawnshops <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi dispatch] During the occupation, a large number of small pawnshops, commonly known as "yatou dian", sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, with one every five steps and one every ten steps. These small pawnshops are no different from bloodsuckers on the common people. The loan periods are short, and the interest rates are high. People are forced to trade with them due to economic hardship, which is no different from drinking poison to quench their thirst. After the victory, the establishment of these small pawnshops continued unabated, and their high-interest exploitation caused considerable harm. In addition to ordering Wujin County to shut down and establish public pawnshops, the Second Administrative Inspectorate of Jiangsu Province has now ordered the Wuxi and Wu County governments to thoroughly investigate and ban them. [Our Suzhou dispatch of the 23rd] Major General Wu Cangzhou, a member of the investigative committee, met with our Suzhou correspondent at the Suzhou office of the Central Trust Bureau at 8:00 PM on the 23rd to answer questions regarding the alleged embezzlement in the takeover of the Second Battalion of the 24th Automobile Group stationed in Suzhou. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) After inquiring from various sources, we learned that the inside story of the embezzlement in the takeover of the automobile battalion can be summarized in four points: (1) One truck was handed over to the Su Company and started operating in June. (2) One three-wheeled truck and one Ford truck were parked at a repair shop and were not reported. (3) One pumper truck was sold cheaply to the fire department of Wenmen. (4) One black van was sold cheaply to the Jinshan Company. Can the commissioner confirm these four points?</p>
<p>(Answer) The matters you mentioned have been investigated and confirmed by me to be true.</p>
<p>(Question) Can the commissioner add any additional details about the case? (Answer) The number of embezzled items in the battalion, including approximately 20 vehicles, as well as a large number of tires and gasoline, were sold cheaply. There are approximately 60 vehicles remaining in the battalion, but they are only empty shells, and the engines and cylinders are all missing. The main culprit in the embezzlement is believed to be the battalion commander, Jiang Xiaoyi, and the first lieutenant adjutant, Ni Pinshan, is also suspected of being heavily involved, having been found to have used a pseudonym to work as the manager of the Jinshan Automobile Company. Unfortunately, both of them fled before I came to Suzhou. I have made comprehensive arrangements and hope that they will turn themselves in. Otherwise, they will have to face the consequences.</p>
<p>(Question) Your group came to Suzhou ten days ago and received many accusations. Can the commissioner tell us about the details and the handling of one or two cases?</p>
<p>(Answer) The accusations received in Suzhou can be divided into three categories: (1) Embezzlement of takeover property, (2) Encroachment on private property, and (3) Poor handling of property. All of these have been reported to the headquarters for review. Our group is ordered to investigate thoroughly and will never tolerate or condone such behavior. This is something that can be reported to the public.</p>
<p>(Question) Does the commissioner have any other tasks in Suzhou besides thoroughly investigating this case?</p>
<p>(Answer) I have no other tasks in Suzhou. I am scheduled to return to Wujin around 8:00 PM on the 24th to investigate the county council's accusations of embezzlement and corruption against the Wujin branch office, which involve a total of eight counts. The contents cannot be disclosed yet. I plan to stay in Wujin for one day and then return to Nanjing to attend the preparatory meeting of the Political Council.</p>

<p>[Our Tiejiang dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau, recognizing the heavy traffic in Zhenjiang, is planning to add a car ferry service. However, the Jiang'an bank of Liuhe is gradually collapsing due to the erosion of the river tides, and the sandbars near Zhenjiang obstruct the river channel, making navigation inconvenient. Engineers were dispatched to conduct an on-site survey and plan to move the Liuhe Wharf to Guazhou and build a connecting line to connect it to the Zhenlu Road. The south bank terminal will be located on the north bank of Huirun Island, and roads and bridges will be built on the island to connect it with the city streets. Plans and funding requests are currently being prepared.</p>

<p>[Our Zhenjiang dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Public Property Administration has actively begun clearing public properties. However, the number of sand fields, lake fields, islands, and government properties in the province is quite large. During the war, they were either released by the enemy puppets or seized by local strongmen, making improvement difficult. It is reported that Chairman Wang, in order to urge thorough clearing and restore government rights, has, in addition to enacting regulations on the management of public properties and clearing methods, instructed the bureau to implement them diligently. Yesterday, he issued a special order to all county magistrates that all sandbars and islands that have not been legally released be returned to public ownership. The rent and profits from this year onward will be investigated and taken over by the local public property branch office. The county magistrates should provide full assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Winter Reclamation and Re-Cultivation Movement in Jiangxi: 61 Counties and Cities Reclaim 400,000 Mu <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang dispatch] Jiangxi suffered eight years of occupation, with 1.5 million mu of farmland abandoned during the war. The fertile farmland lay fallow, causing a sharp decline in grain production in Jiangxi, known as the "Granary," resulting in a severe food shortage. In order to utilize the winter fallow period to reclaim the abandoned farmland during the war, increase agricultural production, and revitalize the countryside, the Jiangxi branch of the Executive Yuan plans to launch a comprehensive winter reclamation movement in the form of agricultural relief, allocating 200 million yuan, 20,000 bags of flour, and 10,000 pieces of farm equipment for the winter reclamation and re-cultivation movement. They have also reached an agreement with the Provincial Reclamation Office on implementation measures, which must be completed by the end of February next year.</p>
<p>The goal of this movement is to reclaim 400,000 mu of fallow land in various counties. The areas to be included are temporarily limited to the 61 counties and cities that were occupied and suffered more severe disasters. Each county and city should select areas with more severe disasters and more abandoned land to implement the program and appropriately allocate the reclamation area for each township based on actual conditions. For counties with less abandoned land, if the total area is less than the specified amount, ponds can be dug to supplement it. Each mu of pond dug will be equivalent to four mu of abandoned land, but the depth and area of the ponds must meet the regulations.</p>
<p>All counties will adopt a work competition method to increase work efficiency in implementing this movement. All relief funds and materials will be subsidized by the branch office, with 500 yuan in relief funds issued for each mu of abandoned land reclaimed and cultivated, and pond digging calculated at four times the rate. For reclaimers with better work performance, materials will be increased as a reward. For example, farmers who reclaim and cultivate 10 mu or more of abandoned land will receive, in addition to the relief funds, an additional 20 jin of flour and one piece of farm equipment; those who reclaim 20 mu or more will receive an additional 40 jin of flour and three pieces of farm equipment. Furthermore, if the overall performance of an administrative district reaches the specified standard, the branch office will issue tractors and large farm equipment to the district commissioner for the establishment of demonstration farms.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nantong News] Since autumn, the local cloth industry in this county has gradually shown prosperity. However, the price of goods has been increasing daily, and the output has also increased compared to before. The original capital has often felt insufficient for turnover, forming a hesitant situation. The person in charge of the guild, Xian Quan, is actively seeking remedies for the welfare of all members. The jointly operated cooperative organized by the guild has consulted with the Bank of China. In addition to the originally set remittance limit of 100 million yuan, it is approved to temporarily release revolving remittances, limited to 100 million yuan for the time being. After negotiation, the principle is that the members of the joint cooperative should still follow the original capital levels of A, B, and C. Any excess will be based on the level and a temporary fund will be added. This is purely temporary. After each redemption of goods, the above-mentioned temporary fund will also be returned. Currently, the members of the cooperative have handled it according to the agreement, and the enthusiasm has been exceptionally high in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Deceased Daughter Married to Wutong: Rich Merchant's Ignorance, Town Leader's Recklessness <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou News] In this county, Lengjia Temple on Shangfang Mountain in Xu Jiao enshrines the evil god Wusheng (commonly known as Wutong). It is said to be quite effective, and the local villagers in the vicinity have deep faith. Even people from distant Shanghai, Changshu, Qingpu, Songjiang, Kunshan, and Wuxi also believe in it. Over the years, the incense has never declined. In particular, a generation of prostitutes and upstarts are more convinced of the act of borrowing yin debts. Recently, a wealthy merchant from Shanghai, Wu Ruixing, had a beloved daughter, Xin Fen, who was beautiful and cherished like a pearl in his hand. Suddenly, she died of illness. Her father deeply mourned her and went to Shangfang Mountain in Suzhou to offer incense and pray to the gods, hoping to transcend her soul. At that time, he also prayed to the female witch, Teng Shen. The female witch spoke nonsense and muttered, claiming that Wu's daughter had been hired as a wife by Lord Shangfang. Wu, deeply attached to his daughter, believed it to be true. He immediately returned to Shanghai, bought a large number of wedding supplies and wedding dresses at a high price, and personally transported them to Suzhou a few days ago. He hired a boat to transport them to Shangfang Mountain as a dowry for his beloved daughter. This matter caused a sensation far and wide, and was learned by Lu Hanwei, the town leader of the jurisdiction, Xin Guo, and Xue Yonggen, the captain of the Self-Defense Force. Seeing that Wu Ruixing was ignorant and could be deceived, they led all the team members to the mountain to intercept him, deliberately obstructing him. After repeated negotiations, Lu Hanwei extorted one million yuan at a high price. Wu had no choice but to pay the price, totaling 800,000 yuan, and was released. This funny event of marrying a daughter was completed. Later, the matter was discovered by the provincial government, which believed that the town leader dared to lead his subordinates to extort money, which was reckless. Yesterday, the county government was ordered to investigate and severely punish him, as a warning to others.</p>

<p>Machinery Stolen, Houses Demolished</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taixing News] The generating capacity of Taixing and Dongyang Electric Light Company is over one thousand kilowatts. During the occupation, Yang, a director of the company, sold all the machinery and houses to the enemy-controlled China Central Company, Zhenyang Electric Company. Until the victory and restoration, the Nantong branch of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Processing Bureau stationed in Suzhou sealed it up. Unexpectedly, after the Communist army broke through the county seat, Zhu Dianying, the custodian of the company during the occupation, secretly removed the seal and stole all the machinery and furniture. By the time the Communist army retreated, the factory buildings were almost completely demolished and have now become a rubble field with only a few remaining machines! It is really regrettable.</p>
<p>The Taixing power plant, now a pile of rubble, has only a few heavy machines abandoned among them.</p>

<p>Improve the Situation of Night Soil Transport</p>
<p>Fujian North Road is a stone road that has been in disrepair for many years and is uneven. Every morning, when night soil carts pass by, the road surface is uneven, and the carts are old, resulting in night soil being scattered all over the road, with an unbearable stench. We dare to ask the Municipal Health Bureau to quickly improve the road for the sake of the health of the residents of this road. (Because the night soil pier is at Lao Zha Bridge, this road is the only way for night soil carts.) If the Health Bureau does not believe it, please come to this road every morning to see that it is indeed the case. (Residents of Fujian North Road, same as above)</p>
<p>Please Collect House Tax from Landlords</p>
<p>In the summer, house tax is usually shared equally by landlords and tenants. However, we have repeatedly asked the landlord to deduct it, but the landlord replied: The rent here is only more than 4,000 yuan a month, and deducting more than 5,000 yuan a quarter is equivalent to receiving one month's rent less. Therefore, they refuse to deduct it, and the autumn tax is about to be collected, but the landlord is still unwilling to deduct it, which increases the burden on tenants. Therefore, it is best to ask the Finance Bureau to directly collect the tax from the landlords to avoid various disputes. (Residents of Fujian North Road, same as above)</p>
<p>Quickly Repair the Damaged Roads in Nanshi</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>The main Zhonghua Road in Nanshi has already been repaired by the Public Works Bureau. The area from Lao Ximen to Penglai Road has been repaired. However, the most severely damaged Yidong Road has not been repaired. As a result, vehicles pass by, houses shake, and dust obscures the sky. The residents in the vicinity are hoping for the Public Works Bureau to come and repair the road, just like a drought hoping for rain clouds. Dare to ask you to publish this letter to urge the authorities to pay attention. (Xu Wenyu)</p>
<p>The Pseudo-Hometown Association Should Be Reorganized Quickly</p>
<p>We are also refugees from Luxi who escaped death and came to Shanghai. Everyone thought that we would be reborn from now on, but unexpectedly, after leaving the line of fire, we embarked on a path of hunger and cold. Seeing our fellow Zhang Liancai, who came to Shanghai, committed suicide because he could not maintain his food and housing - fortunately, the villagers of Husi donated money for burial, so that he would not be exposed. Now it is late autumn, and the cold winter is coming soon. We refugees who do not have the courage to commit suicide will inevitably become starving corpses in Shanghai. I heard that there used to be a Shandong Guild Hall, which owned tens of millions of yuan worth of real estate. It should have everything for handling hometown welfare and charity. Later, the pseudo-hometown association colluded with the traitor Su Chengde and plundered all the property of the Shandong Guild Hall for its own use. Moreover, the chairman of the Hometown Association, Wu Zuojun, is not from Shandong, but from Jilin Province in Northeast China. Therefore, it does not accept Shandong refugees, but accepts more than one hundred people from Northeast China, who eat and live in Qilu Villa, and all problems are resolved by the pseudo-hometown association. I think that illegal organizations established under the eggs of traitors during the enemy's occupation should be thoroughly investigated by the competent authorities and reorganized so that truly poor fellow villagers can rely on them.

<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 23rd, 5:20 PM (Shanghai time, 24th, 6:20 AM) Broadcast: The second annual plenary session of the United Nations, attended by the best diplomats from fifty-one United Nations countries, opened today at 4:00 PM (New York time, i.e., 5:00 AM Shanghai time). First, the President of the General Assembly, the Belgian Foreign Minister, Spaak, delivered a speech. Half an hour later, President Truman stood up and delivered a welcome speech for 25 minutes. The main points of the speech are as follows:</p>
<p>A peace based on justice among nations will allow the world to get out of the pain caused by war sooner and improve the conditions of life. People all over the world are eagerly hoping for a just and lasting peace, so it must be realized as soon as possible. President Truman believes that all major problems can be solved by goodwill and effort. Therefore, the two most important responsibilities of all countries at present are to establish control over atomic energy and to eliminate other weapons that could cause mass slaughter. The President also said that lasting agreements between allies cannot be imposed on other countries by one country. Such agreements must be based on the legitimate rights and interests of the countries concerned. He acknowledged that there are indeed differences among the allies, but we do not need to exaggerate these differences. He said, "In my opinion, there are no differences that cannot be resolved according to the principles of the United Nations Charter." When discussing Germany and Japan, the President declared that these two countries must be permanently disarmed and the warlords must be permanently eliminated. The President only mentioned three countries in his speech, namely the United States, Germany and Japan, but judging from its content, it is clear that he attached great importance to the relationship between the Soviet Union and Western countries.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 23rd, 4:20 PM (Shanghai time, 24th, 5:20 AM) Broadcast: President Truman originally planned to travel by train from Washington to New York, but temporarily changed to a plane and arrived at LaGuardia Airport at 3:00 PM (i.e., 4:00 AM Shanghai time), only one hour away from the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. President Truman could not ride in the same plane as Byrnes, because he was afraid that if President Truman had an accident, Byrnes would have to take over as president. (The United States currently has no vice president. If the president unfortunately has an accident, the secretary of state will take over as usual.)</p>
<p>[United Press New York 23rd] When President Truman attended the United Nations General Assembly today, he was escorted by 2,652 police officers. It is rare for the city to dispatch so many police officers to escort.</p>
<p>[United Press New York 23rd] On the second day of the conference, discussions will begin on the reports submitted by UN Secretary-General Lie and the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council, followed by speeches by representatives of various countries. These speeches will continue until next week. As for the major issues to be decided, there are vetoes, refugee relief, permanent headquarters of the United Nations, and territorial trusteeship.</p>
<p>[United Press New York 22nd] The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly decided on the agenda today. The session will last for about six and a half weeks. Among them, the entertainment programs include the New York City Government hosting representatives from 51 countries and a luncheon at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. President Truman will host a dinner for representatives from various countries in Manhattan in the evening.</p>

<p>[United Press Washington 22nd] Secretary of State Byrnes met with reporters today and said that the Four Foreign Ministers will discuss the German issue at the meeting on November 4, and the draft peace treaty with Germany will also be discussed after the Foreign Ministers' meeting. I hope that the Four Foreign Ministers can thoroughly study the German issue so that a peace conference with Germany can be held. If necessary, I can go to Europe again at any time to continue discussing this issue. Byrnes then explained in a sarcastic tone that the United States stopped lending to the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia to avoid these loans from making them slaves of gold-dollar imperialism. Byrnes denied that the United States had decided to refuse to lend to the Soviet Union and its neighbors, but said that future loans must have two prerequisites, namely (1) whether there is a need for it, and (2) whether there is a friendly relationship. Byrnes also said that it is human nature to hear accusations of economic enslavement of other countries. Therefore, the United States must be sure that the borrowing country does not think that the United States intends to reduce it to slavery. The loans that the United States can lend are not inexhaustible, and they all come from American taxpayers.</p>

<p>[French News Agency London 22nd] Regarding the Bulgarian general election scheduled for the 27th of this month, the Soviet Union believes that the Bulgarian general election is its internal affair, so it refused to send personnel to observe it under the control of the Allied countries. The British government has protested to the Bulgarian Soviet Bureau, and the British government has also instructed its representative, General Huxleigh, to protest to the Bulgarian government and the Soviet representative. According to responsible sources here, the Soviet Union's claim that the Bulgarian general election is an internal affair is not accepted by the United Kingdom. According to the Yalta Conference, the three powers agreed to adopt a common policy to ensure that all countries in the Balkans can hold free elections, and the people of Bulgaria cannot vote freely at present.</p>

Bevin warned that Britain will adhere to the Potsdam Agreement's terms on Germany, and if it is not fully complied with, it should be completely revised. Foreign interference in Greece must end, and the international negotiations on the Tartar Strait need to stop the war of nerves. Bevin also said that if we want to complete lasting peace and economic recovery in various meetings in New York, we must be prepared to recognize the legitimate interests of other countries, and prioritize the public interest over our own interests. Britain is determined to promote understanding among all countries. If this cannot be achieved, it is often not the fault of the British government.</p>
<p>Bevin also touched on the Chinese issue, briefly saying that the US government's sending of Special Envoy Marshall to China was an extremely wise move. The failure of the mediation was not Marshall's fault. Marshall always used his wisdom and patience to do his best to promote reconciliation between the two sides.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the policy towards Germany, he said that the United Kingdom supports the adoption of the following two principles, namely (1) establishing a kind of politics to ensure that the world prevents the re-emergence of German dictatorship or the revival of aggressive policies. (2) Rebuilding an economy so that Germany and foreign countries can share the benefits of German industry and resources in a peaceful environment. Bevin said that his views are almost completely the same as those expressed by the US Secretary of State in Stuttgart. The British government also welcomes Marshal Stalin's statement of "no new war."</p>

<p>[United Press Seoul 22nd] Two riots occurred here today, and the residence of the Seoul Police Chief was shot at. Cities in the US-occupied area of ​​southern Korea have recently experienced repeated riots, mainly attacking the police.

<h3 id="e71">Under the Leadership of the Socialist and Communist Parties, Japanese Farmers Refuse to Hand Over Rice to the Government: A Glimpse of the Current Situation of the Japanese Farmers' Union <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Tokyo Special Correspondent 23rd] As the labor movement in October gradually comes to an end, the target of left-wing activities is gradually shifting from urban to rural areas. In Nagano and the Hokuriku region, some farmers have refused to hand over rice to the government. Farmers' unions, agricultural associations, and agricultural associations in the Tohoku region, under the leadership of local branches of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, are also tending to respond to this movement. It is said that the reasons for refusing to hand over rice to the government are (1) the government has repeatedly stated that it will allocate agricultural tools and fertilizers in exchange for the rice handed over, but the results are not very good, (2) stimulated by the strike offensive of various industrial labor union conferences, the voices of farmers expressing support have gradually risen, (3) the Communist Party has long expressed opposition to the current government's method of handing over rice, and the Socialist Party is also not interested in the government's launching of compulsory measures to force farmers to hand over rice. Therefore, the activities of the branches of the Farmers' Union under the leadership of the two parties are becoming increasingly strengthened. In other words, there is a growing sense of unease in rural areas about the impending agricultural panic. The government has not been able to fulfill its promises of allocating materials for the exchange of rice. In addition, with the current surging wave of labor strikes, farmers are easily exploited politically by left-wing elements under this uneasy mood. The Japanese Farmers' Union, which has millions of members across the country, attaches great importance to this situation. After the parliament closed, it sent personnel to various places to inspect. After all the reports arrive, it will express its attitude. It is said that the Japanese Farmers' Union was originally founded in Taisho 11 (1922) by Christians Toyohiko Kagawa and Genjiro Diishan. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in Showa 12, cadres of the association, such as Kanju Kato and Mozaburo Suzuki, were arrested for participating in the People's Front, resulting in a lack of leadership. The association then voluntarily announced its dissolution. Later, Rikiizo Hirano and Masaru Nomizo (both currently members of the Socialist Party) formed the Farmers' Reform Alliance, but it was soon forced to dissolve by Tojo. On February 9 of this year, the Japanese Farmers' Union formally announced its establishment. The Communist Party and the Socialist Party have very different opinions on the association's activities. The Communist Party had previously regarded the Japanese Farmers' Union as a reactionary group. After the Communist Party representatives Sanichi Nosaka and Ritsu Ito negotiated with the association's cadres, the opinions of both sides gradually became closer. Now, in Aomori, Tochigi, Ishikawa Aichi, Okayama, Hiroshima, and Saga prefectures, the two parties have adopted a common front stance. In other prefectures, the two parties are still opposed to each other. The association currently has one million members, of which 70% support the Socialist Party and 30% belong to the sphere of influence of the Communist Party, the Liberal Party, and the Progressive Party. The association's president, Yoshito Sunaga, died suddenly during a meeting speech. He is now represented by Secretary-General Masaru Nomizo. The standing committee members, except for Hisada Kuroda, are mostly right-wing members of the Socialist Party, such as Toshio Onishi, Soji Okada, Shozo Hirano, Koichi Nakamura, and Yoshio Matsumori. The Japanese Farmers' Union is like the Labor General Alliance led by the Socialist Party, and most of the cadres are members of the Socialist Party. It is feared that it will still take a negative attitude towards this anti-rice handover movement, because the Labor General Alliance had previously expressed opposition to this political strike.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Under the Supervision of MacArthur's Headquarters, Japanese Industrial Economy Recovers; Strict Organization Prevents Decline Despite Defeat in War <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— (Translated by this newspaper from the "Millard's Review")</p>
<p>Mr. J.B. Powell, editor of the "Millard's Review," recently wrote an article in his publication reporting on Japan's post-war economic situation, stating: At a time when China is currently facing various difficult problems in industry and foreign trade, it is quite interesting to observe Japan's significant development in this area. China has restored most of its complete industrial regions, but it is still struggling in the mire of economic stagnation and will soon reach the day when it exhausts all foreign loans. On the other hand, Japan's industrial areas were severely damaged during the war, but it is now rapidly rebuilding its national economy, and within a few years, it may regain its economic leadership in Asia.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of experts at MacArthur's headquarters, Japan has set production quotas for various items and hopes to complete them. The revival of some industrial sectors is mainly due to MacArthur's promotion, as MacArthur wants to enable Japan to obtain a solid economic foundation so that it can quickly cope with reparations and occupation costs. Although this policy makes some people, who are familiar with Japan's past rapid development from rural feudalism to modern industrialism, feel uneasy, the headquarters believes that supervision is very strict, and the recovered industries are non-military. Officials at the headquarters further pointed out that industries directly related to the war have been destroyed, and other types that can be converted into war industries have also been dismantled and shipped to the victorious countries as reparations.</p>
<p>This argument seems quite accurate, but in fact, the remaining industries are enough to enable Japan to "profit" in foreign trade in the past year. According to statistics, from the end of the war to the end of August this year, Japan had a trade surplus of 51,702,000 yen, equivalent to about 3,452,800 US dollars. Exports in one year included raw silk, tin, lead, tea, hard rubber, tungsten sand, etc., with a total value of 1,525,916,000 yen, while imports included raw cotton and food, etc., with a total value of 1,474,124,000 yen.</p>
<p>The most complete of all economic plans of MacArthur's headquarters, and the most relevant to China, is the cotton spinning plan. If this plan can be completed in the next few years, the day when the people of all Asia will once again wear "Made in Japan" clothing is not far away.</p>
<p>Japan originally had 12 million spindles, and although only more than 2 million spindles remained after the war, the output of cotton yarn and clothing is increasing every month. Currently, raw cotton is imported from the United States and India, which have surpluses. 890,000 bales (500 pounds per bale) have been ordered in the United States, and 300,000 bales of Indian cotton will arrive in early next year. At the end of the war, Japan still had a lot of raw cotton and semi-finished cotton, which had been made into 100 million square yards of clothing.</p>
<p>According to MacArthur's headquarters' plan, starting from early next year, Japan will have a gradually increasing production surplus. Finally, 50% of the production will be exported to the Philippines, Burma, Malaya, India, and even China. The export of this cotton yarn can be exchanged for foreign exchange to purchase food and pay for occupation costs.</p>
<p>The headquarters is even more ambitious about restoring Japan's silk weaving industry. The goal of the cotton spinning plan is only to restore the pre-war Asian market, while the goal of the silk weaving plan is to monopolize the world. The world's need for silk weaving after the war has been greatly reduced due to the increasing improvement of rayon and "nylon." It is estimated to be about 30 million pounds per year, while Japan's initial target planned to be completed in 1951 is as high as 35 million pounds.</p>
<p>The recent dispute between President Song and Mr. MacGana, the silk industry consultant of MacArthur's headquarters, has clearly pointed out the attitude of MacArthur's headquarters towards China. MacGana accused the organization led by President Song of intending to take over Japan's silk industry economy; however, non-official observers in Tokyo believe that this fact is "birds of a feather flock together." In other words, there are many people who are enthusiastic about taking over Japan's silk industry.</p>
<p>Regardless of the dispute between Song and MacGana, MacArthur's headquarters is still willing to help the revival of Japan's silk industry to the extent that it can meet the needs of the whole world and make Japan the main source of foreign exchange income. The headquarters believes that if Japan's silk industry is affected, China's silk industry will not be helped in any way. The so-called influence includes making Japan lack raw materials and equipment or making China compete with Japan in the world raw silk market.</p>
<p>Although some newspapers in this city issued two "face-saving" news items a week ago, saying that despite MacGana's accusations, Japan will still transport 10 million pounds of silkworm cocoons to China, in fact, unless MacArthur orders a small amount to be transported to China for "face-saving" reasons, there is little hope. Several months ago, General Zhu Shiming of the Chinese delegation stationed in Japan requested the transportation of 10 million pounds of silkworm cocoons to China, but was rejected, and later reduced to 4 million pounds; it was still not approved. The reason is that by mid-November, Japan itself will also face a shortage of silkworm cocoons.</p>
<p>Among the officials of MacArthur's headquarters, some privately believe that the purpose of the Chinese government is only to prevent Japan from using silkworm cocoons because China itself cannot make good use of them. They also said that according to reports received, the Chinese side misused the seeds that MacArthur gave to the Chinese people. These seeds are seeds of mulberry bushes, which are of better quality than seeds of mulberry trees, and were originally intended to be distributed to planters in war-torn areas, but in fact, the Chinese government sold them on the black market and priced them high, so that many of them withered and rotted before they could be sold.</p>
<p>The historical economic antagonism between China and Japan seems to be brewing again, and Japan has the momentum to regain the upper hand because Japan's efficiency and ability in strict organization have not been significantly reduced due to the failure of the war. In addition, Japan has received a large amount of assistance from the occupying authorities in raw materials and technical consultants, while China, although it has made significant progress in industrialization in the past half-century, is currently consuming most of its energy in internal conflicts.</p>
<p>In short, MacArthur's headquarters has been working to make Japan a strong country in Asia in terms of politics and economy, and judging from the achievements of the past year, it seems to have had a very good start.</p>

<p>(Agence France-Presse, New York, 22nd) The United Nations General Assembly will open here on the 23rd, at which time New York will become the capital of the world. New York City was already crowded, and the sudden increase of more than 5,000 guests has made accommodation a major problem. The reception staff of the General Assembly rushed around the city, searching for accommodation for representatives from various countries in major hotels and smaller apartments, and were covered in sweat before they could arrange everything. In the lounges of the hotels, small disturbances were caused by language barriers. Many vehicles for receiving guests were parked outside the hotels, and the representatives wanted to experience the taste of New York nightlife before starting their arduous work. Banners with the slogan "Support Our United Nations" can be seen everywhere on the streets, and many shops use the flags of all United Nations member states as decoration. Young foreign girls wear costumes from various countries, and there are displays of United Nations stamps. Most export companies display huge maps showing the locations of their main customers around the world. Open-air concerts and dance performances are held in Rockefeller Plaza, where flags are flying, and the streets are full of rental cars with United Nations stickers. The police department has mobilized reserves to assist in maintaining traffic and serving at the venue.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Two Methods Determined to Conserve Electricity: Fines and Power Outages for Exceeding Limits; Public Utilities Bureau Electricity Conference Decides on 20 Degrees as Standard, Hoping Residents Will Reduce Light Bulbs <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Due to the severe electricity shortage in this city, the Public Utilities Bureau held an electricity conference yesterday afternoon to discuss specific measures for conserving electricity with various electricity companies. These measures are divided into two categories: restriction and fines, and will be submitted to the city government and the Public Utilities Committee of the Senate for approval and implementation. The details of each measure are as follows: A. Restriction Method: (1) The standard electricity consumption for all users is 20 degrees. If the electricity consumption exceeds this amount, it will be calculated at 70% of the highest electricity consumption in the 12 months from October of last year to September of this year. If the discounted amount is less than 20 degrees, it will still be calculated as the minimum amount of 20 degrees. (2) For users who have been using electricity for less than one year, it will be calculated at 70% of the highest amount of electricity used in the past months. (3) The principle for new users is not to exceed 20 degrees. Special large buildings can be submitted to the meeting for discussion. B. Fine Method: (1) Each company will first notify the users of the limits. (2) If the user exceeds the limit, they will be fined five times the amount. (3) If the user exceeds the limit again, they will be penalized with a one-week power outage. After the meeting ended, Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, also told reporters: With winter approaching, we have no choice but to adopt this method before the city's electricity production can be greatly increased. We hope that the citizens will assist in saving electricity, especially that users can automatically reduce light bulbs. We especially hope to save electricity from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM, because at this time, both users and yarn factories need electricity.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Subcommittee Decides Restriction of Electricity Use is Not Based on Law and is a Disturbance to the People; Senators Wang Jian'e and Others Propose Correction by the General Assembly <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, Senators Wang Jian'e, Jiang Pingfan, Cheng Juncan, Yu Chuanding, and others believe that the decision of the Public Utilities Subcommittee of the City Council to restrict citizens' electricity use has no legal basis and involves disturbing the people. They have jointly sent a letter to the City Council requesting a correction. The original letter is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>To whom it may concern, the City Council has various subcommittee organizations during the recess period, which are freely participated in by various senators and are not elected by the General Assembly. Their task is only to review proposals that have not yet been discussed by the General Assembly and events submitted by relevant government bureaus for discussion, formulate opinions, and then submit them to the General Assembly for discussion, and of course, they have no decisive power. According to a report on the 22nd of this month, the Public Utilities Subcommittee decided to restrict citizens' electricity use, which is obviously not based on law. Moreover, it involves disturbing the people and cannot be decided by a small number of senators. We request that the convener of the subcommittee be notified to make a correction, and we hope that all subcommittees will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Pan American Airlines Opens Far East Air Route; Will Send Aircraft West Next Month to Inspect Route <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Since the end of World War II, Shanghai, known as the famous city of the East, has once again become the transportation hub of the Far East. Foreign airlines are vying to open routes in Shanghai. Currently, the airlines in Shanghai, in addition to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC), also include Philippine Airlines (jointly operated by US businesses and the Philippine government, represented by China Travel Service and Whelly Hahm &amp; Co.), Pan American World Airways (represented by CNAC, assisted by China Travel Service), and Far Eastern Air Transport (represented by Chengta Corporation). There used to be Pacific Airlines, but it has now been canceled. When the US military was stationed in Shanghai, US military aircraft traveled frequently. Now, because the US military has been transferred from Shanghai, the traffic of military aircraft has decreased slightly. Now, Pan American World Airways is preparing to open a new Far East route and will send an aircraft on November 21 to fly across the ten major cities of the Far East, making a 24,000-mile trek to inspect the possibility of opening a Far East air route. The route starts from Honolulu and goes to Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, Tokyo, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Calcutta, Rangoon, Bangkok, Saigon, Singapore, Batavia, Manila, and back to San Francisco. If this Far East route is opened, the transportation of the above cities will be more convenient than before. Taking Japan as an example, currently, in addition to military aircraft, there are no civilian aircraft to Japan. And to fly to the Siam area, it is necessary to go through Hong Kong, which is quite circuitous. However, the establishment of this Far East route must obtain the air rights from our Ministry of Transportation or be represented by us. Since our country has recovered the rights of territorial waters and aviation after the abolition of unequal treaties, foreigners who want to operate airlines in China must comply with the above conditions. Therefore, if Pan American's Far East route is established, it will be represented by CNAC. Currently, the airports available for use in Shanghai are Longhua Airport, which is jointly managed by CATC and CNAC, but the length of the runway is insufficient, and large transport aircraft still have to land at Jiangwan Airport. It is reported that the runway of Longhua Airport may be rebuilt. If the airport is not enough for use in the future, Hongqiao Airport may also be rebuilt and used. Pan American's route goes from Shanghai to Manila, Guam, Midway Island, Wake Island, Honolulu, to San Francisco. The fare from Shanghai to Manila is US$225. To Honolulu, it is $730. To San Francisco, it is $922. Each person is allowed to carry 55 pounds of luggage.</p>

<p>The third batch of supplies for the Public School Teachers and Staff Supply Office has been determined to be 30,000 bolts of the finest spun An An blue cloth, priced at 85% of the average price reviewed in August and September. Each person is limited to 10 yards, about 20,000 yuan. The detailed measures and exact price will be finalized today. In addition, the office plans to concurrently register public school teachers and staff for uniforms during the distribution of cotton cloth. The materials are dark blue Melton and dark blue uniform cloth, limited to 3 yards per person, priced within 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>After this, it is planned to distribute canned evaporated milk, which was purchased by the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), totaling 3,000 cases, 48 cans per case, totaling 144,400 cans, each can weighing one pound, priced at 650 yuan, which is half the price on the market. In addition, there are also large cans of canned food, cheese, cocoa, butter, coffee, and other varieties, all waiting to be distributed.</p>

<p>Regarding the recent surge in doctor's consultation fees in Shanghai, and even maternity fees reaching one million yuan, citizens are really suffering from unbearable burdens. The reporter recently met with Zhu Qiluo, Standing Director of the National Medical Association, and inquired about this issue. According to his opinion, doctor's consultation fees are often a matter of controversy, but the most ideal solution is for the local Medical Association to negotiate with social and health authorities to set a standard based on the actual living conditions in the area, so that it is fair. In addition, the Medical Association should also formulate free clinic regulations and notify all members to implement them, in order to demonstrate medical ethics. Public hospitals are established by the municipal government to benefit the citizens, and all doctors' salaries and facilities are paid by public funds, so they are taken from the people and used for the people.</p>

<p>(Reported by this newspaper) At 8:15 AM yesterday morning, a military truck carrying many soldiers collided with another truck on Pingliang Road, Da Xiantang Road, East Shanghai. The heads of both vehicles were damaged.

<p>Criminals Zou Chunmao, male, 30 years old, from Xinghua; Zhang Changgen, male, 23 years old, from Yancheng; and Zhou Yongtai, male, 25 years old, from Xinghua, were jointly convicted of robbery and intentional homicide. After being captured and interrogated by the Garrison Headquarters, it was found that the criminal Zhou Yongtai had waited in ambush at Hongqiangtou, Ouyang Road in this city. Zou Chunmao and Zhang Changgen disguised themselves as passengers and hired a rickshaw on North Sichuan Road. When they reached Hongqiangtou, Ouyangli, they strangled the rickshaw driver Zhang Zineg. The rickshaw was then sold to a civilian, Li Guangli, and the money was spent. After interrogation by the Military Tribunal, they confessed without denial. Since the criminals committed robbery and murder, which are heinous crimes, they were taken to the Jiangwan execution ground yesterday afternoon and executed by firing squad as a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e84">"The Wolf of Changshu" Committed Heinous Crimes; Family Members of Victims Cried Out; A Former Enemy Military Police Translator Provided Two Key Pieces of Evidence, Attempting to Earn Merit and Promotion, Resulting in a Major Injustice <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) Judge Lu and his four colleagues from the military tribunal, who recently conducted an on-site investigation in Changshu of the crimes committed by the enemy military policeman, Haruki Miyamura, returned to Shanghai by evening train the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Judge Lu told reporters in his office yesterday that the trip was very fruitful. After learning of the opening of the court, local residents and people from nearby villages who had been harmed by the enemy military police filed complaints. Family members of the victims traveled from afar to testify in court. Among them were elderly men with white hair and young widows wearing mourning clothes, all crying and pleading for justice in court.</p>
<p>The most important new discovery this time was a man surnamed Lu, who used to work as a translator in the military police team. This person was arrested by the authorities after the victory and was initially sentenced to death, but later the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and is currently imprisoned in the Suzhou Higher People's Court Prison. According to his confession, two important clues were obtained: (1) The reason why Miyamura started major injustices was to earn merit and promotion. Although Miyamura was the captain of the military police team, his rank was only lieutenant. He repeatedly hoped for promotion. At that time, it was the period of the Qingxiang Qingcheng Campaign, so a certain translator suggested, why not cater to the psychology of his superiors and arrest underground workers? (This translator knew that he had committed heinous crimes at the end of the war and cried to Miyamura for help. Miyamura gave him money and bought a car for 2 million yuan in counterfeit banknotes to help him escape without a trace.) Miyamura then made preparations in advance, demolishing the Yang family's house next to the team headquarters and rebuilding it into four prisons. Then he secretly instructed the translator and Sergeant Noguchi to find ways to approach and spy on local people, and indiscriminately arrest and falsely accuse them of predetermined crimes. (2) Among the victims, in addition to some who were sent to the 13th Army Military Law Conference in Shanghai to be executed, there were five others who, according to Miyamura, were sent to the then County Hospital. However, according to the translator, he had witnessed Wen Xingwu being tortured to death in the military police team prison. He had also gone to the grocery store opposite the team headquarters to buy long sticks of incense and candles to burn, and had an argument with the grocery store over payment. Similar situations were countless in the military police team. After Wen Xingwu's death, Miyamura instructed Jin Shaozhou, the then director of the County Hospital, to issue a certificate proving that he died of illness and reported it.</p>
<p>More Than 100 Buried Alive</p>
<p>Judge Lu and others also went to the former enemy military police team headquarters, which is now the site of a parachute unit, to search for evidence. Grass mats, broken shoes, and other items were found in the dry well there. As for the bodies buried alive in the wasteland outside the North Gate, there were too many to dig up, estimated to be more than 100.</p>
<p>The chief clerk previously interviewed the doctors and clerks related to the first hospital, etc., and they were also summoned this time. Their statements were still the same as before. The only thing that can be proven is that the County Hospital at that time received patients sent by the military police team. Whether they were cured or died, they were returned to the military police team for collection or burial.</p>
<p>After the military tribunal sent people to conduct on-site investigations twice in the Miyamura case, the evidence is quite sufficient. A retrial will be held soon, and the day when the demon will be punished is not far away.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Weights and Measures Inspection Institute has sent personnel to investigate the sheng and dou used by rice shops and the weighing instruments used by food vendors in the vegetable market. If they do not meet the standards, they will be ordered to correct them. The institute will also investigate whether the rulers used by shops are all standard market feet and prohibit the use of "yards" or English feet as measurement standards. It is reported that the China Textile Company in this city sells cloth mostly in "yards," which violates the unification of the weights and measures system. The institute will submit a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to order the company to use the market foot for calculation.</p>

<p>The Trade Union of the British Merchant Tram Company of this city presented four demands to the company's management on the 25th of last month: (1) A ten-thousand-yuan education loan for each person; (2) Bonuses for drivers and ticket sellers calculated according to the cost of living index; (3) Provision of uniforms for staff and metalworkers in the mechanical department; (4) Calculation of wages for accounting staff according to special grade standards. The Social Affairs Bureau considered points one and four to be unreasonable, while points two and three were deemed reasonable and should be complied with. Almost a month has passed, and the company authorities have yet to express acceptance of points two and three. The trade union, unable to wait any longer, held a meeting of group representatives at 3:00 PM yesterday and decided that if the company authorities do not provide a satisfactory response by 2:00 PM this afternoon, they will implement a "treat" starting at 2:00 PM this afternoon, meaning that vehicles will continue to operate, but tickets will not be sold.</p>
<p>The Materials Supply Bureau Receives One Hundred Jeeps</p>
<p>Fifty Will Be Sold to the National Government, the Remainder Will Be Supplied for Civilian Use; Five Hundred Weapon Transport Vehicles to Arrive in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau received one hundred Jeeps yesterday, transferred from the U.S. Foreign Surplus Materials Clearing Committee. After receiving this batch of Jeeps, the Supply Bureau must repair them. After repairs, fifty vehicles will be sent to Nanjing for use by representatives of the National Assembly, after which they will be sold to the National Government. The remaining fifty vehicles will be sold for civilian use, but how they will be allocated is currently undecided. There are currently over three thousand applications to the Bureau for the purchase of Jeeps.</p>
<p>The number of Jeeps received by the Materials Supply Bureau's Okinawa Storage and Consolidation Office is extremely small and mostly dilapidated. This is because the former Okinawa war zone was under the jurisdiction of the Manila area and should have been managed by General MacArthur. After the victory, officers' families under MacArthur successively went to Japan, so the complete Jeeps originally stored on Okinawa were all sold off.</p>
<p>However, the Bureau will soon receive five hundred weapon transport vehicles shipped from Okinawa, each with a selling price of US$2,200. Applicants can contact the Bureau and pay half of the deposit.</p>
<p>Two Ships Chartered to Transport Supplies from Okinawa</p>
<p>According to Zhou Zixin, Deputy Director of the Bureau and Director of the Okinawa Storage and Consolidation Office, the most numerous item received by the office is cranes, numbering one thousand, and there is also a large amount of wharf equipment. It is said that at that time, the U.S. Navy landed 60,000 people on Okinawa, and the Army had 20,000, for a total of 80,000 U.S. Army and Navy personnel. The thoroughness of their equipment can be imagined, so there is an extremely large amount of surplus material. After this wharf equipment is transported to Shanghai, it will greatly assist in the unloading, transportation, and supply of materials for the General Relief Administration and the Supply Bureau. The Bureau recently reached an agreement with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to charter two ships for regular service. The first batch of over two hundred technicians heading to Okinawa will depart today, and another two hundred will depart at the end of the month. When the ships return to Shanghai, they will transport a large number of military blankets and road building materials. In the future, it is expected that 20,000 tons of various equipment can be transported each month, and they will be shipped as soon as they are repaired. In addition, U.S. military ships will assist in transportation. Deputy Director Zhou is scheduled to visit the island again next Monday.</p>
<p>The Supply Bureau will also establish a storage and consolidation office in the Mariana Islands to organize and receive surplus materials from the island. The Bureau has appointed its senior advisor, Ding Tianling, as the head of the office, and Ding will depart for his post within days.</p>
<p>Lang Jingshan Holds a Joint Photography and Calligraphy Exhibition with His Wife Before Going Abroad</p>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] For forty years, Mr. Lang Jingshan, China's top photography expert who has consistently strived for the art of photography, has enjoyed extremely high reputation not only domestically but also in Europe and the United States. Mr. Lang's exhibitions have long won the praise and admiration of many art lovers, so there is no need for the reporter to elaborate. However, in recent years, Mr. Lang has not held a photography exhibition for a long time. This time, at the invitation of the United States to lecture and to attend the New York Aviation Photography Competition as a judge, he is holding a joint exhibition of photography and calligraphy before going abroad.</p>
<p>This exhibition of Mr. Lang's photography and calligraphy is being held on the second floor of the Great China Department Store from the 20th to the 26th. In addition to 136 of Mr. Lang's photographic masterpieces over the years, there are also portraits by Mrs. Lang, Lei Peizhi, and several national paintings jointly created by Mr. and Mrs. Lang, all of which are very exquisite and wonderful.</p>
<p>Mr. Lang's montage photography is especially his unique and meticulous expression. This type of photograph can compensate for the shortcomings of single photographs and combine the essence of various images to create the most beautiful and perfect work. However, the success of a montage depends entirely on experience and meticulous technique. If there is any deficiency, it will become clumsy, but each of Mr. Lang's works is like a naturally created painting, seamless, and without any flaws. This is indeed not something that can be studied and achieved overnight. In the exhibition, works such as "Sunset at Wushan," picturesque and poetic, were exhibited in England and won the Royal Photographic Society Award, and works such as "Layered Mountains," solemn and majestic, were also published in the British Photography Yearbook. In addition, many works such as "Tiger Roaring" and "Bamboo in Mogan Pavilion" are rare masterpieces in the Chinese photography scene.</p>
<p>Mr. Lang is not only a pioneer in China's photography industry but also the first person in a newspaper to have the title of photography reporter. When Mr. Lang was fourteen years old, he began taking pictures with a homemade box camera and developing photos with self-made blueprint paper. In the first year of the Republic of China, he joined the Shen Bao newspaper and often worked with painters Shen Bochen and Ding Song. Once, Mr. Lang took a picture of willow trees by the bridge in Hardoon Garden. Ding Song admired it very much and sent the photo to the Times Pictorial for publication. Later, when the Times Pictorial needed to send someone to take photos for a special edition on the Far Eastern Games, Mr. Lang, at the request of the host Huang Bohui, took on the role of photography reporter, and his fame has remained to this day.</p>
<p>During his trip abroad, Mr. Lang will also go to Rome to photograph religious architecture and historical sites. After returning to China, he will surely produce more valuable and exquisite works.</p>

<p>The Central Trust Bureau was previously ordered to assist citizens in building new houses and to offer low-interest construction loans, which will be realized within days. According to the person in charge of the Bureau's Real Estate Department, the principles of construction loans have been determined: (1) The loan amount is limited to 400 million yuan. (2) The loan will be secured by the building site. (3) The term is tentatively set at six months. (4) The interest rate is not fixed and will depend on the loan amount, creditworthiness, and the level of interbank interest rates. The detailed measures have been submitted to the board of directors of the Four Banks Joint Treasury for review and will be implemented soon. According to the person in charge, the four banks and two bureaus of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China were ordered to build new houses to solve the housing shortage and the housing problems of civil servants. The original fund of 40 billion yuan has been reduced to 20 billion yuan due to the excessive amount and will be entrusted to the China Trust Bureau for management. The Bureau will seek suitable sites for construction. The types of buildings will include apartment-style and city houses. In the future, a portion will be rented out, with civil servants having priority rights. Another part will be sold by building. The architectural drawings have been completed and are awaiting final decision. It is said that this construction will be superior to the public housing village built by the Municipal Engineering Bureau and will be carried out in areas with convenient transportation.</p>
<p>Severe Disaster in Zhejiang Province: Director of the General Relief Administration's Branch Office in Zhejiang, Sun Xiaolou, Comes to Shanghai to Appeal for Increased Allocation of Relief Supplies</p>
<p>After eight years of war, Zhejiang Province has suffered unprecedented wind, insect, and flood disasters again this autumn. The affected areas reach 39 counties, accounting for more than half of the province. Sun Xiaolou, Director of the Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the General Relief Administration, came to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday specifically to appeal to the General Relief Administration for increased allocation of relief supplies for the disaster victims in Zhejiang Province to provide emergency relief. According to Sun, the counties in Zhejiang Province affected by disasters this autumn are most seriously affected by floods. The counties in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River, such as Chun'an, Suichang, Tonglu, Jiande, Fuyang, Pukou, Zhuji, Xiaoshan, and the counties in western Zhejiang, such as Wuxing, Changxing, and Deqing, have suffered severe disasters, which have not been seen in 30 years. In Xiaoshan County, due to its location on the banks of the Qiantang River, 45 villages and towns have been affected, with over 100,000 mu of farmland damaged, making it the most severely affected. According to reports, 23 counties, including Xindeng, Lin'an, Wukang, Shaoxing, Shangyu, Huangyan, and Kaihua, have been surveyed, and statistics show that a total of 831,264 mu of farmland have been affected, and 252,465 disaster victims urgently need relief. Sixteen counties, including Fenshui, Hangzhou, Yuqian, Anji, and Xinchang, are still in the process of surveying and reporting, and the loss figures are still being counted. With the north wind gradually strengthening and the cold currents approaching, the plight of these disaster victims is particularly pitiful. I have made a special trip to Shanghai to appeal to the General Relief Administration to quickly increase the allocation of relief supplies to save these hundreds of thousands of disaster victims who are crying out for food. Sun also said that since August, in addition to continuing to assist in the construction of seawall projects, the work of the branch has focused on agricultural land, water conservancy, and King Zhen's projects. As of the end of September, 145 completed and uncompleted agricultural land and water conservancy projects have been approved one after another. The counties throughout the province are generally promoting these projects, which will make a great contribution to the post-war construction of the province. As for the housing losses suffered by Zhejiang Province due to the war, there are a total of 553,000 rooms. In counties such as Anji, Wukang, Fuyang, Xiaoshan, Tonglu, Haiyan, Haining, and Changxing, the housing losses in the entire county are almost 80% or more. Without allocating huge amounts of subsidies, it is impossible to restore the original state. The branch has already prepared a plan and requested the General Relief Administration to quickly find a way to provide relief. Regarding the business of the Fujian Provincial Office, the branch has recently obtained the approval of the General Relief Administration to directly command and supervise it.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 8:00 PM on the 20th, the patrol team of the Zhabei Branch heard cries for help while passing Song Park Road on Guonan Mountain Road. The team leader Wang Shou, plainclothes police chief Zhang Hualing, plainclothes officers Shi Xueliang, Chen Fulin, Rui Wenzhen, and Wang Yunlong went forward to investigate. They were told that Zhang Yongxing, a rickshaw puller residing at No. 3, Tianfu Lane, Jiangxi Road, was soliciting business on Haining Road when two people in uniform hired his rickshaw to the north end of the railway. When they arrived at their destination, the two pulled out pistols, threatened him, and robbed him of ten gold rings, a felt hat, an old wool sweater, and 25,000 yuan in legal tender. After hearing the statement, team leader Wang went to the Gonghexin Road police station, and Patrol Officer Jin Delin led the police to pursue the suspects. At the intersection of Zhongxing Road and Yuyingtang Road, they heard cries for help again. It was already 9:40 PM, and they followed the sound. In the darkness, they saw figures swaying. The police officers ordered them to stop. However, the other party, preemptively, drew their guns and fired two or three shots. The police also returned fire. As a result, one thug fleeing north was shot in the right leg and fell to the ground. The other thug escaped and could not be captured. The victim and the wounded thug were taken to the station for questioning. The victim, Zhai Ruwen (from Yancheng, 33 years old, residing at No. 95, Jurong Road), also a rickshaw puller, was soliciting customers in front of the Great Shanghai Theater on Xizang Road when two people in uniform boarded his rickshaw without discussing the fare. When they arrived at the aforementioned location, they threatened him with guns. As he was about to be robbed of the gold ring on his hand, he shouted loudly, and the thugs released him and fled. The arrested thug, Zhang Longfei, 26 years old, from Jiangxi, admitted to serving in the police force and did not deny the robbery. The branch will complete the investigation and submit the case to the Garrison Command for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e97">The Inside Story of Shanghai's Pickpocket Gangs (4) <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Testing the Sharp Edge: Clothes Pockets Slashed</p>
<p>"Pickpockets" are not a new trade; every major city in the world has this profession. In Shanghai, this thriving business is exclusively managed by the "Pickpocket Gang" within the "Old Brothers' Society." This is the third type of activity group within the "Pickpocket Gang." Members of the gang are collectively referred to as "running business." The gang is divided into two major categories: one is called "running small game," which refers to the "three-handed thieves" we know, and the other is called "running deep game," which specializes in activities at the docks. Here, we will first describe the "running small game" category.</p>
<p>"Running small game" is a most promising and dangerous trade. If you are not careful, you will be caught on the spot, and the perpetrator will inevitably suffer a severe beating from the victim and passersby before being sent to the police station and prison. Therefore, only top-notch members of the Pickpocket Gang can take on this role. The so-called "flexible fingers and nimble waist" (jargon detailed earlier) is most needed. Those who study this trade are divided into three specialized electives, each requiring years of hard work to become "professional." They are: Category A, the "scissor gang"; Category B, the "running trade winds gang"; Category C, the "ground pickpocket gang."</p>
<p>The "scissor gang" aims to steal money bags and watch accessories. They carry a small knife or an old coin, ground to a very sharp edge, to slash open people's pockets and steal. Each operation requires at least one assistant, but they do not greet each other on the surface, only exchanging signals through eye contact. They first have the assistant bump into the target person. When the person turns his head to look, they immediately seize the opportunity to strike. Sometimes, if they think the target is a difficult customer, they strike before bumping into them. After stealing, the perpetrator secretly passes the stolen goods to the assistant, who immediately opens the way. If they are on a tram, they strike first, and even if the victim grabs the perpetrator, they can deny it because there is no evidence. By this time, the small sharp tool they carried has already been discarded.</p>
<p>Master of Sleight of Hand: Expertly Performing Unique Skills</p>
<p>The "running trade winds gang" does not carry any sharp tools and relies solely on sleight of hand to steal people's money bags and gold jewelry. This is the most difficult skill, so only veterans can handle it.</p>
<p>The "ground pickpocket gang" does not target money bags but rather the luggage of travelers. Therefore, their area of activity is at train stations and docks. Shanghai's transportation network is distributed over land and water, but the order has always been chaotic. Every traveler is always living in a rush and confusion. The "Old Brothers" stand by and wait, conserving energy and waiting for a fat target to devour. On one hand, they use accomplices to ask false questions or create trouble for the opponent, diverting their attention. Then, they use the most agile means to move one or two pieces of suitcases or packages. Or, they spot a passenger arriving by rickshaw. When the rickshaw stops, the passenger must pay the fare and pick up belongings placed on the ground, so the pickpocket gang can begin to strike. In short, this gang's target is those things that have just "landed," hence the name "ground pickpocket."</p>

<h3 id="e98">Second Lawsuit for Additional Payment of Deposits: 1,000 Yuan Deposited Ten Years Ago, Claiming 4 Million Yuan in Payment; Bank of China Sued by Depositor, Song Hanzhang Appears in Court <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The 10th Civil Division of the District Court heard a lawsuit this morning regarding the additional payment of a fixed-term deposit. The plaintiff, Huang Huitang, deposited 1,000 yuan of national currency under the name Renji with the Savings Department of the Bank of China's head office on July 29, 1936, for a fixed term of ten years, which expired on July 29 of this year. Huang argued that the social economy and currency value have undergone drastic changes over the past ten years, and the value of 1,000 yuan of legal tender ten years ago is far different from the current currency value. Therefore, he requested the bank to pay 4,493,000 yuan in legal tender according to the cost of living index of 4,493 times in July, but the Bank of China did not agree. Huang Huitang filed a lawsuit with the local court, requesting relief and permission to pay the deposit and statutory interest according to the cost of living index. This morning, Song Hanzhang, the legal representative of the Bank of China, appeared in court in response to the summons. After questioning in court, the court ordered a change of date for further hearing, considering it inconvenient to make a rash decision at this time. It is reported that in August of this year, the local court of this city ruled that the defendant, the Four Banks Savings Association, should pay the plaintiff, Chen Jilin, an additional amount of 1,000 times the 2,000 yuan of legal tender and its interest that he had deposited in a long-term savings account before the war, which aroused national attention. This is the second case of litigation for additional payment of pre-war deposits.</p>

<p>The Education and Social Committees of the Municipal Council held their second meetings simultaneously at the Council's headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The Education Committee discussed three temporary motions: (1) Urging the Municipal Government to allocate the abandoned site of Hongqiao Airport to build a secondary education district in accordance with the Council's General Assembly Resolution Education No. 12. It was resolved to request the Municipal Government to contact the central government as soon as possible to allocate the site and name it the Zhongzheng Cultural District to commemorate the Chairman's sixtieth birthday, and to include the construction costs in next year's budget. (2) Urging the Municipal Government to quickly supervise the agencies and troops occupying school buildings to vacate the premises within a limited time in accordance with the Council's General Assembly Education Resolution No. 8. It was resolved to request the Education Bureau to first thoroughly investigate and clarify the names and locations of the occupied schools and the names and numbers of the occupants, and then the Council will assist in handling the matter. (3) Requesting the Municipal Government to submit a report on the implementation of the Council's General Assembly Education Resolution and temporary motions to the Council before the third meeting of the Education Committee. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>The Social Committee discussed three motions: (1) The General Assembly referred the motion to strengthen the review of theatrical singing work to rectify social morality. The motion was amended to actively promote normal entertainment and improve theatrical singing and entertainment to rectify social morality. (2) The General Assembly referred the motion to request the relevant ministries and departments of the central government to formulate separate regulations for the organization of employees in various industries. It was resolved to amend the motion to request the central government to restore the organization of shop clerks and trade union and to promulgate separate regulations, which was passed. (3) The Committee on Separate Regulations transferred the telegram from the Health Bureau to the Health Committee for review, asking whether foreign pharmaceutical merchants could be registered and join the trade association as a matter of discretion. After discussion, it was resolved to first request the Social Affairs Bureau to explain the situation before submitting it to the next meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Central Printing and Mint Factory Denies Rushing to Print Banknotes <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It has recently been rumored that the Central Printing and Mint Factory is working day and night to rush to print banknotes. The reporter specifically inquired with senior officials of the factory today, who said that this statement is not consistent with the facts. The factory's current work includes sending personnel to the United States to study improvements in banknote printing technology. Today, the most sophisticated printing technology in the United States can print 250 horizontal lines in an area of one square inch. Our country should redouble its efforts in this regard. After the banknote printing is improved, it can not only prevent counterfeiting but also increase the beauty. Another task is to undertake the printing of official documents and forms for the Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and other agencies. In addition, the Taiwan currency is quite lacking, and the factory has been ordered to produce a portion to supply circulation. The Central Printing and Mint Factory has two factories, one in Beiping and one in Shanghai, and another printing house with a very small scale. The sum of the production capacity of these three units is far from the huge quantities reported in the newspapers.</p>

<h3 id="e102">"Tiger of Jiangyin" Death Status Uncertain, Further Investigation Pending; Batch of Japanese War Criminals Escorted to Qingdao <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the enemy secret agent "Tiger of Jiangyin," Jiro Shimoda, was sentenced to death by a military tribunal, the execution has not yet been approved. It is understood that the reason is that the Japanese liaison team is still trying to save the demon's life. They recently appealed to the Ministry of National Defense, accusing Zhang Yuren, the principal of Jiangyin Middle School and a key witness in the trial, of being a traitor who collaborated with the Japanese during the occupation. After the victory, he was once wanted by the Jiangyin County Government. In order to clear his name as a traitor, Zhang testified that Shimoda Jiro committed murder, and his testimony is not credible, and so on. After receiving this submission, the Ministry of National Defense has now ordered the military tribunal to reinvestigate, so the death of the "Tiger of Jiangyin" is still far away, and may even be overturned. According to Zhang Yuren's testimony, the Jiangyin Japanese Lovers' Soldier Team killed 12 of our underground workers on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival last year. The eleventh and twelfth victims were killed by Shimoda. Zhang was the thirteenth victim, but because he appeared to be an enemy agent on the surface but was actually working underground, he was on good terms with Shimoda, so he was rescued by Shimoda.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense yesterday received 39 Japanese war criminals, including Lieutenant General Hosokawa, who were escorted from Qingdao and will be sent to the First Pacification Zone Military Tribunal for trial.</p>

<p>Wang Shuxian, the son of Wang Yi, is 54 years old. He was accused of serving as the executive director and ship director of the pseudo-China Shipping Company, and of opening the New China Shipyard with Yu Jianmin to repair ships. The High Prosecutor's Office filed eight lawsuits against the two on suspicion of treason. However, Wang never appeared in court during the High Court trial. The case has now been concluded, and it was announced yesterday: "The trial of Wang Shuxian is suspended, and Yu Jianmin is not guilty." The presiding judge stated the reason for the verdict: because the ships repaired by the defendant were of a commercial nature and not military ships, they did not constitute the crime of treason.</p>

<p>Tao Yongqin, a local woman, 19 years old, lost her parents early and was raised by her uncle, Tao Keyu, who lived at No. 2 Huaqingfang, Shipi Lane. This spring, she was introduced to the Great Enterprise Transportation Company at No. 2 Huangpu Bund Road as a staff member. Xu Yongliang, a shipowner from Ningbo of the Shanghai Industrial Company (50 years old, residing at No. 1 Ningdeli, Huacheng Road), married to Wang and with children, had assets. Because of his dealings with the Great Enterprise Company, he met Yongqin. On the afternoon of May 11 this year, he lured Yongqin to the Tongxing Hotel near the Grand Theater for dinner. Taking advantage of Yongqin's drunkenness, he took her to the Jielu Hotel and raped her. From then on, their relationship became even hotter. Recently, Xu opened a permanent room No. 21 at the Jiaotong Hostel on Middle Zhengzheng Road, living and going out with Yongqin as if they were husband and wife. When Tao's uncle found out, he reported it to the Taishan Branch Bureau. Zhang Rou, the chief of the Criminal Justice Section, took plainclothes police to arrest Xu Yongliang and Tao Yongqin together the night before and brought them to the police station. Xu confessed that he was introduced to Yongqin by Li Zaichen and his wife, the manager of the Great Enterprise Company. Tao Yongqin said, "Xu initially lied to me that he had no wife and was determined to marry me, so I was deceived. Now the woman is pregnant," and so on. Tao Keyu said that Xu Yongliang lured his niece, a businesswoman, and should be dealt with according to the law. Chief Zhang believed that the defendant Xu Yongliang had violated the crime of obscenity and ordered him to be detained and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial this morning.</p>

The main regulations of the Ministry of Communications are: (1) The ship's age must be less than 30 years, (2) The draft must be less than 18 feet, (3) The speed must be more than 10 miles per hour. Recently, the Central Bank has been strictly reviewing the shipping industry's request for foreign exchange to purchase ships. The shipping industry has repeatedly decided to negotiate with the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Communications' decision is the result of the request. In addition, Japan has decided to compensate our country with a floating dock that can manufacture 10,000-ton ocean-going ships. The Assets Committee's Central Shipyard is actively preparing at Wusongkou to enable this dock to be transported to China as soon as possible.</p>

They believe that the current departure procedures are too cumbersome and the restrictions are too strict, causing great inconvenience to entering and exiting other cities within China, while Chinese people in the United States and other places do not have the same restrictions.

<p>(1) Underdevelopment</p>
<p>Zhang Chonghua asks: I developed at the age of fourteen. Because of my youth and ignorance, I mistakenly committed the bad habit of masturbation, which hindered my development. I am now 25 years old, short in stature, and suffer from neurasthenia.

After the four children were poisoned, their families sent them to Gongji Hospital on North Suzhou Road for emergency treatment.

<h3 id="e117">Yarn Allocation Largely Determined; Allocation Price is 1.75 Million Yuan, Foreign Cotton Approved for Foreign Exchange Settlement, Low-Interest Loans Approved, Factories Approved to Transport and Sell Outside Shanghai <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Chairman Wu of the Textile Business Management Committee convened the second Textile Management Committee meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room yesterday afternoon after returning to Shanghai from seeking instructions in Beijing a few days ago. Vice Chairman Li Shengbo, members Shu Yinzhang, Lin Fengbao, Yang Biren, Wang Qiyu, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, and Liu Wenteng, director of the committee's business office, attended. Xi Yushu, Liu Jingji, Liu Piji, Wu Kunsheng, Rong Yixing, and others were present. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m. The meeting proceeded as follows: (1) Raw cotton issue: After Chairman Wu sought instructions from President Song, President Song has agreed to restore the foreign exchange settlement of US cotton and decided to implement it nearby. However, factories should apply to the Textile Management Committee for approval before purchasing US cotton. Therefore, factories must quickly fill in the current amount of cotton in stock, production equipment, and cotton consumption. Factories with cotton stocks insufficient for three months of consumption can apply for purchase. (2) Allocation and sales price: After much heated debate, it was decided that the allocation price of 20-count standard yarn is 1.75 million yuan. Other counts of yarn will increase or decrease accordingly. (3) The total amount of the first batch of allocated yarn and its allocation method: The total amount of yarn allocated in the first half month is set at 12,004 and a half pieces. Zhongfangjian Company accounts for one-third of this, totaling 4,001 and a half pieces. Private factories account for two-thirds, totaling 8,003 pieces. (4) Allocation and sales targets and methods: Six industrial associations, such as machine dyeing and weaving towels, blankets, knitting, handkerchiefs, underwear, and handmade cotton weaving, will be given priority as sales targets. The allocation and sales method will be that the Textile Management Committee will first determine the quantity to be allocated based on the needs reported by each industrial association, and then hand it over to the Allocation and Sales Committee for allocation and sales to each industrial association, and then each association will transfer the allocation to its member factories. (5) Factories allocated the first batch of 12,004 and a half pieces of yarn should have all the goods ready by tomorrow to facilitate allocation and sales. According to statistics: the yarn allocated in January was only more than 20,000 pieces, accounting for only 38% of the city's total monthly output. The remaining cotton yarn is allowed for factories to transport and sell outside Shanghai. (6) The Central Bank is eager to support and develop China's textile industry. In the past, the bank provided low-interest loans of 5% for the foreign exchange settlement of long-term US cotton. If the foreign exchange settlement of US cotton is restored this time, the bank will still follow the old example and provide low-interest loans to factories that need funds when purchasing cotton. (7) In the future, the Textile Management Committee's strategy for dealing with cotton yarn will focus on reasonable evaluation. A reasonable evaluation is enough to eliminate the black market for cotton yarn. After the black market is eliminated, the demand for cotton yarn will not be as large as it is currently. (8) In the future, the Textile Management Committee decided to hold a committee meeting once a week. If the yarn price fluctuates, it will discuss it in detail at the meeting to decide on appropriate countermeasures.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Yarn and Cloth Have a Very Solid Foundation; Indanthrene Costs 30 Million Too High, Yarn Market Hovers, Fine Yarn Rises Another 40,000 to 50,000 <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the yarn market was firm first and then fell back. In the early morning, customers slightly inquired. At the opening, the Special Double Horse once rose to 2.43 to 2.44 million, and Lanfeng rose to 2.19 million, but the transaction was sparse. At the close, it fell back to 2.4 million. The other 20-count brands were all in the process of rising and then weakening. As a result, there was not much rise or fall compared with the previous day. There was a search for fine yarn and thread, and all counts above 32 rose by 40,000 to 50,000. The foundation is still very solid. Yesterday, the cloth market was also firm and stable. Although sales were not strong, the price remained stable. The original reason was that there was not much production and the bottom was thin. Especially because of cost factors, factories were unwilling to sell a large amount. Moreover, the joint allocation and pricing of yarn made the yarn factories feel that the cost was insufficient. If a reasonable allocation and pricing are to be generally achieved, a re-adjustment is necessary. In the morning market, Blue Chicken was traded at 77,500 yuan, the trumpet spot goods were quoted at 77,000 yuan, and the Four Gentlemen Biji was 93,000 yuan. Old goods were quoted at 95,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of Indanthrene dye has approached 30 million yuan. The cost of each piece of 190-count glossy Indanthrene is as high as 49,000 yuan. Recently, Indanthrene cloth sales have not been large and the price is still stable. If customer sales are strong, the price of Indanthrene cloth must rise without any doubt.</p>

<p>Yesterday's gold market was even more mediocre. It opened at 2.225 million in the morning. After opening, there was selling at 2.23 million. This price was difficult to cross. There were not many transactions. Although it fell slightly, there was no special change. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 130 bars at a price of 2.2225 million. At this time, the low price was only 2.222 million. However, the supply was extremely sluggish. The money market was still loose. Near noon, it rose again to 2.236 million. At noon, it was at 2.23 million. In the afternoon, it continued to rise slightly. The next-day delivery was quite stable. As a result, it rose 8,000 compared with the previous close. Ornaments and silver were unchanged. Silver dollars fell back to within 1,800 yuan. The implicit short-term interest rate was still loose and the interest rate was around 15%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were relatively loose. The US dollar's implicit market was 4,050 yuan to 4,100 yuan in the morning, and 4,070 yuan to 4,120 yuan at noon. The official market price was still not active. Compared with the implicit market, it was slightly less than the previous close. There was less supply than demand for Hong Kong dollar notes, but the quoted price was still similar to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was sold at 85 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was supplied at 1,070 yuan. The British exchange rate was 14,100 yuan to 14,200 yuan. The US exchange rate was unchanged, and the pair trading was still quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Bond Market Dull <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Public bond trading was thin and the situation was extremely flat. The A type only rose and fell by 80 yuan. It opened at 2,050 yuan to 2,080 yuan in the morning, fell slightly to 2,000 yuan midway, and finally struggled around 2,050 yuan. As a result, there was not much rise or fall compared with the previous close. Types A, B, and E were flat, and Type D rose slightly by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Silk Trading Weak <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The artificial silk market was even quieter yesterday because today is also the Central Trust Bureau's allocation period. No. 120 Tianqiao was quoted at 50,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. No. 150 Guangguang was traded at 3.45 million yuan yesterday, 100,000 yuan more than the previous day. The scarcity of goods is valued, and speculation is inevitable. Because the factory experienced sluggish trading, the quoted price could not stand and showed a slight weakness. CE grade was quoted at 50,000 yuan yesterday, ordinary goods were quoted at 100,000 yuan, and Qianjing also shortened by about 100,000 yuan. Silk sales were still weak, and the quoted price was stable. There was generally not much increase or decrease yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Silk Price No Longer Changes, Experts Study Grades Today <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The raw silk purchased by the China Trust Bureau has been priced by the Export Sales Committee. Based on the foreign market price, D grade is the standard. It is understood that this county price will not be changed because the government has done its utmost to help silk merchants and cannot increase the expenditure of the national treasury. Moreover, when this batch of purchased raw silk will be shipped abroad and sold is still unknown. Therefore, the committee has no intention of changing the price again. According to the person in charge of the China Trust Bureau, the current problem is to re-identify the quality of the silk because there are slight differences in each grade of raw silk. For example, D grade still has C grade, which should be raised to C grade. If there is E grade, it should also be changed to E grade. It is now scheduled to invite experts to conduct thorough research today and suggest that the Export Sales Committee make a final decision. It is heard that the Export Sales Committee is scheduled to hold its fourth meeting at the Central Bank tomorrow.</p>

<p>American woolen cloth has been selling well in recent months, and shipments have been arriving steadily. At a time when wood factory goods are expensive and in short supply and British products have not been delivered, a situation of booming sales has been created, monopolizing the market for a while. However, the goods that arrive at the port are all wide-width, such as rubber cloth-like long rolls of decoration, which makes both buyers and sellers spend a lot of effort. If domestically produced woolen cloth still cannot strive to move forward, reduce costs, and increase production in the future, the woolen cloth market will inevitably be full of imported goods.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau began collecting goods tax on tin foil and superstitious paper, it will strengthen control over the paper foil industry to prevent tax evasion. All foil factories and merchants producing and selling tin foil should apply to the local government and tax authorities for registration, regardless of whether they are opening or closing. The warehouses and storage places for storing tin foil superstitious paper should indicate the types of goods and fill in the forms daily for the amount of goods transported in, transported out, and the balance, and investigate them on a ten-day basis. As for the distribution of goods after tax payment, the date should be clearly stated according to the distance of the route.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] It was recently reported that the second shipment of Chinese tea to the UK after the war would arrive mid-month. This has now been proven incorrect, with the tea expected to arrive around the end of October. This shipment is larger than the first, estimated to be between 4,000 and 8,000 pounds. Some quantity has already been sold based on samples, at prices ranging from three shillings and fourpence to five shillings per pound. The Ministry of Food recently approved the import of 2.5 million pounds of Chinese tea before the end of the year. However, the high prices, the instability of the situation in China, and the inconsistent quality are deterring importers.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the spokesperson of the Central Bank gave a statement on the situation of the Bank's Board of Directors Meeting. He said, “The third Board of Directors Meeting was held in Nanjing from the 11th to the 20th of this month, lasting ten days. More than 500 proposals were received from the head office and branches. All of these proposals have been carefully examined and studied by groups. The more important issues that have been resolved include the following: (1) Regarding the rediscount, mortgage transfer, and foreign exchange mortgage loan businesses, the Bank will prioritize providing loans to businesses involved in the production and sale of essential daily necessities or major export goods. Each branch will select loan targets and scopes based on local industries and export goods, and will organize syndicates similar to the Shanghai model to promote low-interest loans to small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises, as well as export businesses. The Bank will also actively promote the circulation of bills and develop and encourage commercial firms to organize syndicates to promote rediscount and foreign exchange mortgage businesses. (2) Regarding the reserve ratio for deposits, given China’s vast territory and the different economic conditions in various regions, the Bank plans to request authorization from the Ministry of Finance to independently determine the ratio within the highest and lowest ranges. The Bank will also authorize each branch to handle matters by region. (3) Regarding the issuance of legal tender, the Bank plans to gradually standardize the format. All past banknotes with inferior printing quality will be withdrawn. (4) Regarding the national treasury business, the Bank will actively implement the recently promulgated measures for the deposit and remittance of public funds, expand the network of public treasuries, and improve the system of entrusted agent banks. The procedures for payments from the public treasury will be simplified. (5) Regarding the Bank's organization, a regional supervision and assessment system will be established, dividing the country into appropriate regions based on financial and economic conditions. Management at the head office will be strengthened. At the same time, a strict examination system will be adopted for personnel, and efforts will be made to ensure the stability of the lives of bank employees in order to fulfill the mission to society and the nation.”</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Direct Tax Bureau, due to the many doubts merchants have about the method of affixing stamps, has specially requested the Ministry of Finance to provide detailed regulations as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When a customer pays a company for goods and holds a return receipt book, the book should have a 100-yuan stamp affixed by the book creator each year. If the money return receipt book, after being stamped, is not accompanied by an invoice, then the recipient should affix stamps according to the rate of the receipt of money and goods in the second item of the stamp tax law rate table. (2) When a company sends goods to a buyer and issues an invoice along with the goods and a return receipt book, the book should have a 100-yuan stamp affixed by the book creator each year. If the book is not accompanied by an invoice and only the return receipt book is used, a stamp should be affixed according to the rate of the invoice in the first item of the stamp tax law rate table each time the goods are delivered.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that overdraft agreements in the banking and financial industries have the nature of surety bonds, and the affixing of stamps should be handled in accordance with Article 8 of the tax law. It has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that it be corrected according to regulations, stating that since the overdraft agreement has already been stamped as a loan, there is no need to affix a surety bond stamp again. Currently, people in the industry claim that when the tax bureau inspects stamp taxes, it believes that in addition to the borrower affixing stamps, the guarantor must affix stamps according to item 29, which is a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Most of the textile machinery manufactured in Northern Ireland for export is stored in warehouses, as there is no way to ship it due to a lack of space. Orders from China, Canada, France, Turkey, Norway, Sweden, and Portugal, as well as Britain, have been processed. Manufacturers say that the current rate of production is about 20 percent lower than before the war, partly because workers know that the machines currently being manufactured cannot reach their destination for the time being.

<h3 id="e141">The Coal Production of Fushun Increases Greatly, 2,000 Tons Can Be Shipped To Shanghai Monthly <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang, 22nd – Chen Zongyang, the Director of the Fushun Coal Mine Bureau, hosted reporters yesterday and gave a speech saying that the Fushun Coal Mine suffered repeated damage after the victory. In particular, the equipment of the power plant was completely dismantled. The power generated by the mine each month is only one-tenth or two-tenths of what it used to be. It is still not enough to maintain ventilation and drainage, which restricts all increase production plans. However, the mine is still working hard to save unnecessary electricity for coal production. Therefore, when he was ordered to take over the mine on April 10, the daily coal production was only 1,000 tons. Now the daily output of the coal mine is 4,000 tons, three times more than before. In addition to self-generation of electricity and local coal consumption, 2,0780 tons can be shipped to Shenyang each month. The current increase production plan is expected to produce 110,000 tons in October. In addition to 50,000 tons for self-generation of electricity, 60,000 tons can be shipped out. 120,000 tons can be produced in November and 130,000 tons in December. However, the coal stored is limited by transportation capacity and it is difficult to supply it to various places.</p>
<p>Also, since the beginning of winter, the coal shortage in Shanghai has become increasingly serious. President Song ordered the Materials Adjustment Committee to ship 2,000 tons of coal from the Fushun Coal Mine to Shanghai every month, starting this month.</p>

<p>Chinese stocks were initially strong but then weakened. The bulls did not perform well, and the bulls on the surface lacked stamina. There was a struggle in the middle, but the situation gradually turned weak. Near noon, the weakness became more obvious. At the beginning of the morning, the opening was high because of the transactions of Jingfu, with one unit being bid up a lot. Although Meiya was difficult to trade, it was also driven up. As a result, the rest all reported higher prices. After the opening, except for Yongsha trying to cheer up, the rest were overwhelmed by sellers who were eager to go downstream. After ten o'clock, the water yarn pulled up after falling low. The yarn flower gang made up for some of the empty positions, and the table gang tried their best to buy in. In the middle, Yongsha repeatedly decided to rise to 745 yuan. The rest also followed, but the gains were far less than Yongsha. However, buying interest stopped at a high level. The Yongsha outside 740 yuan failed to stand firm, and the process gradually showed a lack of strength. At 11:20, Yongsha started to sit down from the last high price of 743 yuan, and the floating bulls gradually ended. Near noon, the table gang cut off their positions, and the situation was extremely tragic. Almost all hot stocks ended at low prices. Compared with the previous close, except for a slight increase in Xin Guang, Meiya fell more, and the rest all reported a slight setback. Cold stocks, except for a drop of more than half a percent in Wu He, had very slight gains and losses. In the afternoon, the shorts did not move. After the break, the table gang once again hyped up the situation, and the market closed in a stable manner. As a result, compared with the previous close, the hot stocks Yongsha, Xinhe, Jingfu, and Xinguang rose slightly, Meiya fell slightly, and Qinxing was flat. Among the cold stocks, Wu He and Zhongsi each fell by about half a percent. Jin Fang, underwear, and Huafeng rose slightly, Tongyi and Jinglun were flat, and the rest all reported a decline. The various stocks outside the market reported another decline.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks failed to maintain high prices for a long time, and many stocks wanted to rise. Yisha, Yinglian, and Hedefeng all saw high prices, but in the end they all returned to lower prices slightly. Compared with the previous close, the steel and shipping industries each rose by half a percent, Hedefeng and Yecheng fell slightly, and the rest were flat.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Director Chen Shizhen of the Education Department Hosts the Press, Reports on the Current Situation of Education in Jiangsu Province. Provincial Education Plans to Start with Expanding Normal Schools, Local Education Plans to Develop a Five-Year Plan Focusing on Elementary Schools. Today, Director Chen Will Return to His Province and Visit Central Jiangsu Along the Way. <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Shizhen, Director of the Education Department of Jiangsu Province, hosted the press in this city yesterday (the 23rd) at 3:00 p.m. at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge. About ten people, including Lu Guanliu, Zhang Yiqu, Xu Weinan, and Sun Dongcheng, attended. First, Dr. Shen Yizhen, the principal of Shangzhong High School, gave an introductory speech, stating that Director Chen of the Jiangsu Education Department had made a special trip to attend the 19th anniversary celebration of the founding of Shangzhong High School a few days ago, and had given many instructions, which was a great honor. Today, Director Chen took the opportunity of coming to Shanghai to host the press and report on the current situation of education in Jiangsu Province. Amidst applause, Director Chen stood up to give a speech, the general meaning of which was as follows: I am very happy to have the opportunity to talk to the Shanghai press about the current situation of education in Jiangsu Province during this visit to Shanghai. In the past, education in Jiangsu Province was a leader in the country, and new education really started in Jiangsu Province. Later, during the Anti-Japanese War, almost the entire province of Jiangsu was occupied, and the provincial government was wandering around, forming a state of anarchy. As a result, educational facilities were completely destroyed. Recalling the glorious history of the past is very painful. Since taking office, I (Director Chen referring to himself) have been eager to restore various educational institutions, but I am troubled by the lack of funds, and the destruction is too severe. The Education Department does not even have a tile left. In addition, educational institutions and affiliated elementary schools in various places have also been severely damaged, which proves that the enemy's destruction of education was its main purpose. When I first took office, I rented a dilapidated hotel in Zhenjiang to work in. Later, thanks to the help of General Tang Enbo, Commander of the Jinghu Garrison Headquarters, part of the prisoner-of-war camp was allocated, and education was able to continue. At that time, we only wanted to have a place to have classes, regardless of whether there were teaching facilities. As long as there was a house that could avoid wind and rain, classes were held on the floor, which was very tragic.</p>
<p>Education is Supreme, School Buildings Come First</p>
<p>Speaking of education in the province: The province's education expenditure currently accounts for 30% of the province's total expenditure. The emergency recovery funds were 170 million yuan last year and 400 million yuan this year. There are currently two specialized schools and two independent colleges in higher education institutions. In the secondary education sector, there are 14 provincial middle schools, 13 normal schools, 7 vocational schools, 15 provincial elementary schools and affiliated elementary schools, and 8 provincial social education institutions. In total, there are currently 61 provincial schools and museums. Before the war, there were 79 schools and museums, and 80% have been restored. However, due to the impact of the war, more than 50% of the school buildings have been completely destroyed or largely damaged. I once said, "Education is supreme, school buildings come first." Therefore, the school building problem is still extremely difficult, and making do with what we have is inevitable. The future education policy has been decided. We will start with expanding provincial and county normal schools, because teachers are the most important. Just for the implementation of the national education plan in Jiangsu Province in the first year, more than 30,000 qualified teachers are needed. Therefore, increasing the number of normal schools cannot be delayed. We have now prepared a detailed plan and put it into practice. After normal education, we will then seek to expand vocational schools. As for ordinary middle schools, we will focus on enriching the content. Except for a few schools that will be added as needed, we do not plan to add any more for the time being. There are too many private middle schools, and we plan to strictly limit them. There are currently 150 schools applying to the department for registration, and more than 100 schools have not applied, but only 48 schools have been approved.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Education Starts From Scratch</p>
<p>In Yunnan, since the 29th year, the rear areas have changed elementary schools into national schools, meaning that all citizens must receive education. Before the war, elementary school students often had to be forced to enroll, but after the war, they wanted to study but could not enter. This contradictory phenomenon shows that the Chinese people have realized the importance of education, and the government should urgently seek a solution to the school shortage. Originally, local education should focus on promoting national education, which is especially urgently needed in Jiangsu after the war. I feel that Jiangsu education must start from scratch. We are now implementing it step by step according to the planned five-year plan. This year, we will first complete the establishment of a central national school in every two townships and a national school in every three wards. In the second year, we will complete the establishment of a central national school in every township and two national schools in every three wards. In the third year, we will complete the goal of establishing a national school in every ward. In the fourth year, we will focus on enriching the content of the central national schools. In the fifth year, we will focus on teaching research. We hope that by following these steps, we can reach the minimum standards for teaching and equipment that should be available. As for the social education sector, more than 60 social education institutions in various counties have been restored. In the future, we plan to actively promote literacy education for out-of-school adults to eliminate illiteracy. However, the required funds are very large, and we are now requesting the central government to allocate a large amount of funds to facilitate the process. In addition, for local educational administrative agencies, we will gradually restore the education bureau and plan to restore it first in first- and second-class counties. On the one hand, we will actively clean up the educational assets in various counties to increase income.</p>
<p>Huts Can Be Used as School Buildings in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>As for education in the counties of northern Jiangsu, more than 20 counties have not been fully restored due to environmental reasons, but in important areas such as Xuzhou, 17 provincial educational institutions have been established. We are now taking further steps to rapidly advance education in northern Jiangsu. This year, we will first restore national schools. Because too many original school buildings have been damaged, we can only temporarily build huts for use. Starting next year, we will gradually restore the original provincial secondary schools. Teachers and textbooks are being prepared, and we are requesting the Executive Yuan to allocate recovery funds to meet emergency needs. In addition, there are two noteworthy problems in education: the lack of teachers and the decline of academic integrity. During the eight years of the war, due to the lack of attention to teacher training and the unreasonable treatment of teachers, many capable teachers have changed careers. According to my investigation, only ten qualified elementary school teachers are in Wuxi City! If this phenomenon is allowed to continue, Chinese education will be completely bankrupt.</p>
<p>The Deterioration of Academic Integrity is the Most Worrying</p>
<p>The most worrying thing is that after the Anti-Japanese War, academic integrity has deteriorated. There have even been cases of students beating teachers in Sichuan Province. Students' lack of respect for teachers is equal to patients' lack of faith in doctors, and the bad consequences can be foreseen. Therefore, in the restoration of education, rectifying academic integrity is the most important thing. I hope that education leaders and people from all walks of life will work together to seek spiritual recovery. Finally, Director Chen mentioned that he attended the 19th anniversary celebration of Shangzhong High School and praised the school's facilities. Despite the great difficulties, it has made great progress, which he is very satisfied with. Director Chen's speech ended amidst applause, and then Sun Dongcheng and Lu Guanliu successively expressed their opinions. The reception ended at about 6 p.m. It is said that Director Chen is scheduled to return to his province today (the 24th) and plans to visit Suzhou High School in Suzhou along the way.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Basketball Charity Game Ends in a Tie: Wah Sheng and Zheng Lun Draw, Demonstrating Equal Strength with 47 Points Each, Game Tense from Start to Finish <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday evening's charity basketball game between Tianjin's Wah Sheng and Luoyang's Zheng Lun teams ended in a handshake draw amidst extremely close and tense conditions, with a score of 47 to 47. Both sides agreed not to extend the game. In the first half, Zheng Lun led with 23 to 21, a two-point advantage. Last night's audience numbered around a thousand. The Basketball Committee used electronic ticket machines for the first time, proving very efficient and accurate. If no other shortcomings are found, the Basketball Committee plans to adopt them permanently.</p>
<p>Auction of Charity Basketball</p>
<p>During the halftime break, a charity basketball auction was held. Initially, Hua Lian Pharmaceutical Factory purchased it for one million yuan. The factory donated it for re-auction, and Mr. Cheng Bo'an also purchased it for one million yuan. Mr. Cheng also generously donated it for re-auction, and finally, Mr. Gu Likang of Paramount Hotel also purchased it for one million yuan. Last night's ticket revenue was announced on the spot, totaling 2,374,000 yuan. All revenue will be allocated to the International Relief Hospital, Nanshi People's Hospital, Bao Li Hospital, and Tongde Medical College for medical treatment and medicine distribution expenses.</p>
<p>Tension Throughout</p>
<p>Last night's game saw both sides playing in good harmony. The situation was tense from beginning to end, without a single minute of letup. After Wah Sheng took the lead with 8 to 3 and 17 to 14, Zheng Lun immediately took the lead, maintaining it with leads of one, two, three, and four points. The number of times the score was tied is countless. Until the very end, Wah Sheng fortunately relied on Wang Youcai's long-range shot to tie the score. The buzzer sounded immediately, and everyone rejoiced, agreeing not to continue the game. Zheng Lun's performance has indeed greatly improved, displaying a strong team style. However, they seemed overly cautious yesterday, appearing constrained. Wah Sheng generally seemed to lack agility, with insufficient stamina and speed to cope.</p>
<p>One Point Lead</p>
<p>Zheng Lun's Cai Zhongqiang opened the scoring, and Yu Ruizhang scored on a free throw. Wah Sheng's Youcai scored two, and Jin Sheng and Jin Ming added to the pressure, taking a commanding lead of 8 to 3. Zheng Lun called a timeout for secret discussion, and indeed, they tied the score at 7 and 8. Jin Ming, Hong Bin, and Youcai scored repeatedly, leading the way. But after 17 to 14, Zheng Lun's Wenlong and Ruizhang each scored two, taking the lead at 18 to 17 for the first time. Wah Sheng replaced Liu Xueqi with Yin Huanwen. After that, both sides scored, ending the first half with Zheng Lun leading 23 to 21.</p>
<p>No Winner</p>
<p>When the two teams returned to the court, Zheng Lun made a slight adjustment, replacing Wang Binghuan with Zhang Gengsheng. After contact, Jin Sheng passed the ball into the basket. Zhongqiang responded in kind. Back and forth, each scored. Zheng Lun led by two points at 27 to 25. When Hongbin scored a long-range shot, the game became a seesaw battle. Xueqi replaced Hongbin, but Wah Sheng still did not improve. The scores of both sides rose and fell, and the battle became heated. At 45 to 44, Han Wentian replaced Liu Xueqi. There was still one and a half minutes left until the end of the game. Ji Zhongqiang scored a long-range shot, making it 47 to 45. However, as the buzzer sounded, Wah Sheng's Wang Youcai scored a basket, making it 47 to 47, resulting in a draw.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of eliminating the illegal occupation of civilian housing, the municipal government previously ordered district councils to conduct investigations with the military police, and military and political organs to strictly enforce the relocation of those illegally occupying civilian housing. It is now heard that the Civil Affairs Department has again sent a letter to the district public offices, ordering them to faithfully complete the implementation within one week and to report the progress in a list, so that it can be compiled and forwarded.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Five Hundred Li in Northern Henan <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Kaifeng, 13th, by Our Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>On October 10th, I departed from Kaifeng to go to northern Henan. As a reporter, I felt that the news from this area has been obscure for a long time, and it was necessary to conduct an on-the-ground inspection.</p>
<p>Northern Henan is also a historical battlefield for great massacres. The historical records are frightening. King Wu of Zhou met with eight hundred feudal lords at Mengjin to comfort the people and punish the guilty. He fought against King Zhou of Shang at Muye, killing countless people. It is said that the blood flowed so much that it could "float pestles" — even wooden clubs could float on it.</p>
<p>Muye is in the outskirts of Chaoge. According to research, Chaoge is located northwest of present-day Qi County, north of the Qi River. Isn't this place now filled with the flames of war? It is also a place where the Chinese nation had a brilliant culture. When the whole world was shrouded in the darkness of ignorance, the bronze culture here was already shining brightly.</p>
<p>I am now setting off towards our "holy land," not knowing what kind of scenery I will see, I cannot help but feel apprehensive. I heard that some ancient artifacts have recently been unearthed in Anyang, which has strengthened my desire for this trip.</p>
<p>Crossing the Sha River North</p>
<p>The late autumn in the north is clear and refreshing, with some lovely aspects. However, this is a relative statement. Because in the spring in Kaifeng, the air is filled with fine particles of dust and sand, forming a thick yellow fog, where you cannot see people five steps away, and the sun also loses its light. It is ten thousand times worse than the foggy season in the Sichuan Basin.</p>
<p>Until now, "desertification moving south" is still a topic worthy of research. But we only need to look at the banks of the Zhang River, the Central Hebei Plain, and the so-called Central Plains' barren sandy lands. Large areas of land are desolate, revealing their original appearance. These soils, free from the restraint of agriculture and water, fly away with the wind. In these places, without the desert moving south, they will turn into deserts themselves. When the yellow fog flies, it will be a time of great chaos in the world.</p>
<p>North of Kaifeng City, it is already filled with these dust and sand, even approaching the city walls. To enter Kaifeng City, there is no need to go through the city gates; you can just run up the sand slopes. Currently, Kaifeng is facing a tight situation, so they have started to dig, which is truly a massive project, wasting labor and money!</p>
<p>Twenty-five Chinese miles north of Kaifeng is the Yellow River. Since the Yellow River breached its dikes in the twenty-seventh year [of the Republic, 1938] and seized the Jia Lu River's course, not a drop of water has flowed here for eight years. The riverbed faces the sky and there is a sand river in the middle of the twenty-mile-wide riverbed, but it is not quicksand, but a vast sea of sand. When a gust of wind passes, it raises layers of sand waves, as if you are in the frontier. No wonder Kaifeng suffers such a severe threat from dust and sand. However, our maps still draw a blue line there.</p>
<p>However, after the completion of the Huayuankou damming project, the Yellow River will return to its old course after being separated for eight years. And now, the train from Kaifeng to Xinxiang passes through the desert at the bottom of the Yellow River. This route is only 180 Chinese miles. In the thirtieth year of the Republic [1941], the enemy dismantled the Daokou-Qinghua Railway east line to connect the Pinghan and Longhai Railways. There was no need to build a bridge; they just dug openings in the dikes on both sides and laid the tracks on the riverbed. In the near future, this branch line will become a historical relic. Now, I am passing through this riverbed, and indeed, it is as level as the ground.</p>
<p>Yu the Great controlled the floods (mainly the Yellow River) for thirteen years, or some say eight years, but he was able to maintain a thousand and six hundred years (or some say four hundred years) without floods. Therefore, in the minds of the Chinese people today, Yu the Great is still particularly great. If he remains perpetually great, the fate of China is truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>Xinxiang in Perspective</p>
<p>The Japanese once attempted to create a miracle, to incorporate the resilient Chinese society into its own system, and to change its inherently unchangeable face in one fell swoop. In some places, it almost succeeded, on the surface. Xinxiang is also an example.</p>
<p>One side is the old city, where the Chinese people still live a conservative life, and the other side is a new city built according to modern urban planning, inhabited by the Japanese. In contrast, the old city is sinking into decay in the dust and sand, while the rising new city shines brightly in the dust and sand.</p>
<p>In just six or seven years, the scale of a new city has been established. Now that the Japanese have run away, these things still have nothing to do with the people in the old city. It is eroded by the tide of victory, and troops pass through wave after wave. The houses become more and more dilapidated, and the more dilapidated they become, the more they are repaired. In the near future, it can be asserted that Xinxiang can be restored to its pre-war state.</p>
<p>Even now, the troops have had to overflow into the old city, which was once carefully cared for by the people, generation after generation, as their warm nest. A city without electric lights, in the darkness, only the shouts of the troops and their lines crawling around. The dust and sand and scorching sun during the day make the order even more tense: the wheelbarrows selling deep-fried dough sticks, with iron bars inserted full of grass signs as trademarks; those wheelbarrows selling raw and cooked beef, hanging small "Qingzhen" signs with red tassels underneath, are lined up along the streets, like flies swarming out of a nest, with throat-splitting cries. This form has been maintained for thousands of years, while in the shops next door, the pitiful small windows are filled with foreign goods, which are just watching those people struggling on the lifeline with burning eyes. I met the owner of an oil shop, who maintained a small storefront on the street in the old city. Almost all the better houses were occupied by the manpower team of a certain group army. After a written request, their superiors approved the release of the storefront, but another group of soldiers came and hung up the sign "Hongxiang Company," successively taking over all the houses occupied by the manpower team, manufacturing and selling peaceful noodle-rolling machines, cotton-ginning machines, and weaving machines. They are the ordnance repair shop of a certain group army. After victory, they didn't even have a share of their own house.</p>
<p>This story is like a multi-faceted gem, each facet can tell us something. How many such ordnance repair shops do you know there are in China? But for a year after the victory, this owner has been harboring great depression. As for him still paying the government house tax and land tax as usual, that is a small matter.</p>
<p>The small hotel where I stayed, considered one of the best in Xinxiang, was originally run by the Japanese. Today, a year later, it still retains some remnants of Japanese-style decoration, but the tiled toilet is impossible to step into. The walls in the room are moldy and peeling, covered with obscene poems and cartoons expressing sexual desire, and piled with dust. The quilt feels like a cold and hard oily pancake, and fleas are so numerous that they bump and crash into my nose. As soon as I sit down, I feel completely uncomfortable. This is clearly already restored to the state of a "small inn for travelers." Therefore, I thought about the reason why the takeover became "robbery" or something else, which can be explained by destiny. Is this really a predetermined fate? It was very uncomfortable to spend a night in Xinxiang, restless all night, coupled with the impressions I saw along the way, surging like waves, because I am Chinese, and the mental pain is even worse than the attack of a million fleas. But it is also a feeling of not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>Looking East to the Taihang Mountains</p>
<p>The Daoqing Railway has been completely dismantled. The eastern section was dismantled by the enemy; after the victory, the western section was first dismantled by the Communist army, and the railway bureau followed to snatch materials. If this typical and outstanding competitive spirit continues to be carried forward, not to mention a railway, the entire world can be dismantled.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid the trouble of swaying in the Yellow River from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou, you can transfer trains in Xinxiang. You also have to transfer trains here to go to Anyang, so Xinxiang has become a transfer station. Passengers must spend the night here. They are all open freight cars, rarely any covered cars. The military is busy and crowded, noisy and lively, and the order is extremely bad. Originally, in such a desolate and broken place, driving this kind of train that is equivalent to fleeing looks more harmonious, and blue velvet cars would show social inequality.</p>
<p>After the train leaves Xinxiang, you can see the shadows of the Taihang Mountains to the west. This old mountain range, like an old man, is hunched over and withered, arranged on the west side of the road, almost completely parallel to the road. Boundless, the momentum is still very majestic. It is a witness to Chinese history, having seen countless changes: how the Chinese nation was ravaged by foreign tribes, how it heroically resisted, and how it slaughtered each other. The Chinese nation began to leave the mountains and forests and went to the foothills to engage in nomadic and hunting activities, constantly fighting. The agricultural life of the Shang Dynasty began. Pan Geng settled on the Huan River because they looked east to the Taihang Mountains and thought of their glorious ancestors.</p>
<p>There are blockhouses along the railway line. Some were left by the Japanese, and some were construction achievements after the victory. From Jixian to Tangyin, they were all occupied by the Communist army. These constructions, including the railway station water tower, were completely destroyed, and the first to be restored were the blockhouses, built quickly and well. As the train passed, I saw the sentry soldiers standing upright on the top, facing away from the railway, holding their rifles and looking far into the Taihang Mountains, motionless. I don't know if they only do this when the train passes. They are still wearing single clothes, shivering in the wind.</p>
<p>I remember that at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, General Zhu De wrote a poem: "Halting my horse on the side of Taihang, in October, snow flies white; the soldiers are cold in their single clothes, shouting 'Kill the bandits' every night." Today, as a reporter, passing through the eastern foothills of the Taihang Mountains, recalling this poem, and thinking back to the grand occasion of the national resistance against Japan, I sincerely hope that a great undertaking of national construction will appear today.</p>
<p>A Merchant's Conversation</p>
<p>The train was full of soldiers. When we arrived in Tangyin, a merchant in plain clothes came up and we started chatting. I learned that he was from the Anyang Power Plant. According to the survey report of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the damage to the Anyang Power Plant during the War of Resistance Against Japan was 70%; but according to him, there was no loss, and there was even slightly more equipment than when they left Anyang eight years ago. He said that he ran the plant for three months this spring, when the price of coal was still cheap, but he lost eight million. Now the price of coal in Anyang is 160,000 per ton. A 500-kilowatt generator burns six tons of coal every day for three hours, but the monthly electricity bill can only collect four million. He leaned into my ear and said softly:</p>
<p>"The government doesn't pay, and neither does the army. Apart from not causing trouble, they can't help with anything."</p>
<p>"In short, this kind of business should be left for officials to handle themselves. The common people can't do it anyway."</p>
<p>We were wandering on the dilapidated platform, where there was a monument erected by the puppet organization during the occupation, saying "Hometown of Yue Fei." The names of a large group of people who erected the monument were on it. Several have been scratched off, presumably traitors. Even traitors eulogize Yue Fei, which is absurd. However, history cannot be erased in the end.</p>
<p>"The Communist army is seven or eight li to the west." He pointed to the Taihang Mountains. The Taihang Mountain area is under the control of the Communist army. There is no coal there, so coal is transported from Zhengzhou. When I arrived in Anyang, I met another merchant. Judging from his accent, he was a native of the Central Plains. He transported one hundred bags of coal from Zhengzhou, each bag weighing two hundred and several dozen jin. In Zhengzhou, each jin was 53 yuan, and in Anyang, the market price was 1,000 yuan for eleven jin. This was his first time doing this kind of business, and he couldn't help but feel a headache about this money-making business.</p>
<p>Not counting the transportation fee from the Zhengzhou coal store to the station platform, the Pinghan Railway charges 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per bag for transportation fee ticket signing fee, 300 yuan for inexplicable porterage fee, 500 yuan for loading and transfer fee, 600 yuan for handling loading and transportation procedures, and the station also requires 100 yuan per bag for watching at night fee, 100 yuan for weighing fee, and 100 yuan for registration fee, adding up to more than 6,000 yuan per bag of coal. After getting on the train, when arriving at Xinxiang Station, the train inspector also wants money, otherwise they will say that the car is broken and cannot be opened, and can only stay in Xinxiang. After arriving in Anyang, there are also porterage, loading and unloading, storage, transportation fees, etc. When transporting into Anyang city gate, the inspection is strict. As usual, the police will collect a "tax" of 200 yuan per item. After entering the city, there is also a "landing tax," which is collected by some tax bureau, 500 yuan per item.</p>
<p>He spent a capital of one million and several hundred thousand yuan, risked transporting coal to Anyang for half a month, and earned less than 100,000 yuan. This is a real merchant.</p>
<p>From transportation agencies, labor organizations, local institutions, to tax authorities, everyone squeezes you and asks for money. Whatever they want, with no laws at all. This is a profound reflection of political chaos. Where is the law? This is by no means a local phenomenon. Closer to home, please look at Jinghu [Nanjing and Shanghai].</p>
<p>Gunfire in Anyang</p>
<p>From south of Tangyin to north of Anyang, on the banks of the Hun River (where the Nationalist and Communist armies have been facing off for a year), the Nationalists maintain a rather narrow and protruding zone. This is by no means a military secret; the common people all know it. But the obscurity of news is unmatched in northern Henan. When the Central News Agency in Baoding, thousands of miles away, issued news that the Nationalist army had crossed the Zhang River and recovered Cixian and Handan, the military and civilians here could not help but be greatly surprised. Although I suspected it, I was not in Anyang. Now that I have arrived here, it is my responsibility to quickly send a telegram to explain the real situation here.</p>
<p>"For a year, we have been putting on a show and getting beaten here." A ranking military officer told me this. After studying the situation of the Nationalist army's strength and deployment, I discovered that the Xinhua News Agency's news that the Nationalist army had set a deadline to open up several railways was also incorrect. At the very least, there is not even a shadow of the Pinghan Railway at all. These are clearly making things difficult for the reader.</p>
<p>There are orders restricting reporters from going to the front lines. On Chinese soil, in a certain area, bullets rain down, people basically lose everything, and even lives are as cheap as grass. This is essentially an irony to freedom of the press. I don't want to carry this sign that has been worn out in China, but I have the freedom to ask the authorities to release accurate news, so that our colleagues are not harmed and readers are not deceived.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Communist army increased the number of troops by six brigades to the area west of Anyang, claiming to attack the city. The city defense of Anyang is tense, the inspection is strict, and firing is taking place more than twenty li away. Tonight, at eight o'clock, as I write this manuscript, there is a rumbling sound of gunfire coming from the west of the city.</p>
<p>The residents have become accustomed to this kind of life in a besieged city for a year and are still at ease. But the military strongly advises me not to go to Xiaotun, although it is only five li from the city. It is said that Communist army agents are everywhere. "A gentleman does not sit under a leaning wall, even if his wealth is ten thousand pieces of gold."</p>
<p>The residents' composure is astonishing. The streets are full of soldiers, surging back and forth. The city is really too small, there is nowhere to play. The shops are only small ones because the apportionment is heavy. Larger businesses cannot and dare not do it. Refugees occupy houses, and the agencies looking for houses everywhere drive the refugees out. Anyang has become a militarily prosperous city with a crowded population and a sluggish market.</p>
<p>Coming and Going from the North</p>
<p>The market outside the North Gate is extremely lively. The people are simply like a tide, mixed with large carts, small soldiers, and livestock, raising choking dust. All kinds of agricultural products, such as persimmons, potatoes, pears, cotton, and homespun cloth, are displayed everywhere, as well as pigs and melon seeds from the north. It is full of shouting and clamoring, and the smell of smoke and oil from the food stalls flies everywhere. Brokers hold abacuses, calculating back and forth. The entire area is more than one li long.</p>
<p>There are people from Daming, Linzhang, and Nanle here, bringing goods and various stories. They take back goods and stories, as well as legal currency. The Communist army accepts Communist currency at a rate of four yuan for one yuan of legal currency, but the price has fallen, and the black market rate is one to three.</p>
<p>The cars coming and going from the north are all small cars, carrying pigs, salt, melon seeds, and pears. The Communist army allows all four kinds of goods to be transported across the Zhang River, but they will levy a tax of 10% to 20%.</p>
<p>"They levy a 60% tax on the income of brokers." I was sitting on a mat with a pear seller from Daming. The mat was full of pears. He had endless stories to tell. He said, "Do you want to report it? You can't finish writing it in two days and two nights."</p>
<p>He was talking about many stories of torture. They are all public. Held in the form of mass meetings. Because I have heard so much along the way, I now just want to seek further confirmation. You may not believe that this kind of thing exists, but I believe this man's conversation. He said that a villager was tied up with ropes on his two big toes and hung upside down on a tree, summoning all the villagers to watch. A woman died of fright. This is one of the entire stories. Suppressing dissidents or punishing violations of the Communist Party government's laws, the Communist army declared that the person should be sentenced to death, or it is "reasonable," but this kind of public torture as social education is quite unimaginable. This is a cruel struggle!</p>
<p>This market is almost the general assembly of news from the Communist army area. Refugees come to find fellow villagers to send letters and inquire about the situation in their hometowns. Coming and going from the north is a dangerous road. Those carters, holding whips, stepping on the northern dust and sand, huffing and puffing, the clumsy vehicles shaking and swaying, slowly walking on the uneven road, just like the fate of the north, its arduous journey, has been going on for five thousand years and has not yet been completed.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Lament of Qidong: Asking You Why Do You Linger in a Foreign Land, Tears Fall, Heart Aches <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Wuyan</p>
<p>Like a Fish Falling into a Cat's Mouth, Unwilling to Spit It Out</p>
<p>"Land situated at the eastern end of the Yangtze River, fish, salt, cotton, and beans are the specialties of the new county, tens of thousands of homes in fertile land, yet the struggle over the 'three assets' has not ceased." This is a little poem hastily composed by the author, recording the situation of my hometown. Since fleeing my hometown, "Qidong," together with tens of thousands of refugees, it has been more than half a year. Experiencing the pain of these six or seven months of refugee life, and recalling the homeland where I lived and worked in peace for half my life, I feel somewhat disheartened and saddened. However, I am still fortunate that, although I am living as a refugee, my body is still as strong as ever.</p>
<p>Qidong was originally called Chongming Outer Shoal, located at the northern mouth of the Yangtze River. The soil accumulated and agglomerated due to the scouring of the tides, the area increased day by day, and the population grew day by day. Separated from Chongming by sixty or seventy li of river surface, due to inconvenience in governance, a movement to establish a separate county was launched early on. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, when the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, Chairman of Jiangsu Province Niu Yongjian and Director of the Civil Affairs Department Mao Zuquan approved the request of the people of Outer Shoal and allowed the establishment of a county, named "Qidong." The first county magistrate, Mr. Yuan Xiluo, was a respected elder of the province. This old gentleman is still alive and well. Not long ago, he telegraphed Mr. Mao Zedong, requesting him to withdraw the communist troops in northern Jiangsu to save the people, and requesting the government to allocate a special plane, intending to fly directly to Yan'an to plead on his knees. Unfortunately, Mr. Mao did not have a compassionate thought and ignored him, fitting the saying, "Like a fish falling into a cat's mouth." Asking Mr. Mao to withdraw from northern Jiangsu seems more difficult than asking a cat to spit out a fish from its mouth.</p>
<p>"Qidong," this small piece of land, in the overall topography of Jiangsu, is indeed remotely located in the southeast corner, not necessarily occupying an important strategic position, and its gain or loss is not of great importance. Since the recovery of Huai'an and Huaibei and the opening of the Grand Canal line, the main force of the communist army has gathered in the central eastern area of Xinghua and Yancheng. The government has also focused its attention there. However, the large amount of materials plundered by the communist army in northern Jiangsu must be transported and digested. It is quite difficult to transport them north to Shandong and along the Longhai Railway line, but it is more convenient to transport them south. Taking advantage of the government's neglect of this point, they have turned Qidong into a general hub for digesting materials in the southeast. The water transportation is convenient, so ships loaded with printed cloth, corn, wheat, and beans flow out in large quantities from the ports of Qidong, transporting them south to Songhu and Changshu, and north to Shandong and Qingdao, exchanging them for the materials and legal tender they need.</p>
<p>Soon after the establishment of Qidong, the Communist Party discovered it, and in the nineteenth year, they launched the famous "August 8th Prison Break Incident," a major riot. Although this incident was quelled by the government, there were often many communist party members lurking in public and educational institutions. During the War of Resistance, after several infightings between guerrilla troops and the intrusion of the enemy and puppet forces, the people suffered greatly. After the Huangqiao Incident, the New Fourth Army laid the foundation east of Yangtai. Guerrilla troops did not participate (i.e., joined the communists). The communist party members lurking in Qidong openly appeared. Because the people had suffered greatly from the guerrillas and the enemy and puppet forces, they had a very good impression of the communists' hypocrisy. After the victory, the communist army confiscated weapons from the enemy and puppet forces, and loudly proclaimed "liberation," but the people did not get a chance to be comforted and recuperated. In their active organization of various anti-corruption associations of young men and women, farmers, workers, merchants, and students, they promoted movements such as suppressing traitors, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, overthrowing landlords, and liquidating assets, and they also implemented struggles to divide land and property, causing the people to feel greatly distressed. When the Poor People's Overturning Team caused chaos, the control of actions, and the massacre of the "three assets," the people recognized the true face of the communist army, changing from a good impression to a bad impression, from a bad impression to heartache, and from heartache to escape.</p>
<p>Escaping the Monk But Not the Temple</p>
<p>The communist party in Qidong divided the area below the township level into several villages, each village with one hundred households, and set up a village head. Among the hundred households, a basic cadre team of fifty people must be organized, referred to as the Basic Team, divided into five squads, each squad of ten people, serving in shifts, equipped with a small number of rifles, and the rest with sharp knives wrapped in red cloth, responsible for patrolling the villages and checking for escapees. Each township has a Poor People's Overturning Team, gathering all the poor and ruffians, shouting and looking for targets for liquidation and struggle, the "asset holders." Without any excuse, those who are struggled against, in addition to handing over all their property, must also be detained for a certain number of days in the name of concealing wealth, observing their actions and checking their possessions. If they escape in advance, the remaining houses and goods will be dismantled or moved away. They put forward the slogan, "Escaping the monk, but not the temple."</p>
<p>The communist army's control of escapees is quite strict. To go out to the market, you must have a pass. To go to other cities, you must obtain an exit permit, stating the reason for the exit, the date of return (at most one month), and you must also obtain a shop guarantee. If you do not return after the deadline, the guarantor will be notified. If you go out for business and return home on time, it is easy to find a guarantor. If you are afraid of struggle and escape, the guarantor is very reluctant because they fear being implicated. It is also troublesome to go to the township office to obtain a permit. Even if the permit is obtained, you must still be checked by the Basic Team on the road and the documents must be inspected by the port staff. Regarding the search, it goes without saying for the goods you carry, paying taxes if necessary, and detaining what needs to be detained. If you bring winter clothes in the fall, you run the risk of being detained, because bringing clothes for long-term residence creates suspicion of escape.</p>
<p>Mournful Birds Cry Everywhere, Wanting to Return But With No Date Set</p>
<p>Hu Xiaochun, the magistrate of Qidong County appointed by the provincial government, was unable to enter the county last year, so he organized a refugee county government in Qinglong Port, reorganized the troops, and prepared for repatriation. In February of this year, he led all the administrative staff and self-defense forces, in coordination with a regiment of the National Army, to be stationed in Lingdian Town, ten li away from the county border, intending to adopt a step-by-step approach to entering the county. They stayed in Lingdian for several days, in peace and tranquility. The National Army retreated to Qinglong. Within two days, the communist army mobilized forces five times greater to surround the Qidong County Government stationed in Lingdian. After fighting for a day and a night, they were finally captured due to lack of ammunition and lack of reinforcements. All were captured, losing four or five hundred rifles and more than ten machine guns. Fortunately, County Magistrate Hu went to Nantong to attend a meeting and was not captured. After this incident, the county government began to flee to Chongming.</p>
<p>Qidong is separated from Songhu by only a river, and is surrounded by Chongming, Haimen, and Nantong, which have long been under the control of the national government. The main force of the communist army has retreated four or five hundred li, but my Qidong, two hundred square li, is still in their control. Three hundred thousand good people are still in dire straits, and fifty thousand refugees are living in the open air, looking at their hometown from afar, a scene of miasma and gloom. The government has announced that the war in northern Jiangsu is coming to an end, but this small piece of land is still unattended! We refugees never want war, nor are we venting our anger, but the use of force is the only way to suppress violence and restore order, which is a settled conclusion. The National Congress will convene soon, and the remaining year is coming to an end in an instant. When will our wish to return home be realized?</p>

<h3 id="e162">On Children's Literature <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Weiyan</p>
<p>In the past two issues, we published two articles introducing children's literature, which were well received by many readers. From the letters we can see that some of these readers who support us are parents of children, and some are comrades who run children's publications. Parents are anxious that their children are being confused by those supernatural and vulgar comic books, fearing that they will neglect their schoolwork and absorb some poisonous ideas. Those who run children's publications are anxious about the lack of capital, that no one is willing to invest in this kind of business, and sometimes they complain that parents are unwilling to help them promote sales.</p>
<p>Here, I think we should reflect on ourselves: Why are those supernatural and boring comic books so popular with children? Why is someone willing to spend capital to publish this kind of small book? And why are some people willing to spend capital to publish this kind of comic book instead of publishing generally so-called noble children's literature? Do you say that comic books require less capital? Then since their capital is small and they can still continue to operate and have a growing trend, why can't we do the same? You say that because those books sell well, and ours don't, so no one is willing to invest. Then may I ask if our research on children's psychology and our general knowledge or book and picture technology are not as good as those authors who publish supernatural and vulgar comic books? Are parents promoting and selling those small books on the stalls? We have to ask ourselves: Why can't our children's literature compete with comic books? Why are the children's books and newspapers we publish not popular with children? Why can't we attract capitalists to invest by gaining widespread readership?</p>
<p>My answer is: "Not that we can't, but that we don't do it!" I don't believe that our intelligence, knowledge, and technology are not as good as those who generally publish supernatural books. But frankly speaking, none of us are willing to spend that much effort and energy to run a publication that strives to cater to children's psychology. Children's education experts are all high above, seeking their own greater development, how can they have time to manage these things. It's already good enough to have a name on a children's publication. Before many excellent children's publications have been published to replace the comic books on the stalls and make children abandon those for these, it is a disgrace to the Chinese children's education community if anyone considers themselves to be a children's education expert!</p>
<h3 id="e163">Two Thousand Years <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Tong Fang</p>
<p>Author: Pu Ren</p>
<p>Publisher: Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>Publication Date: June 1946</p>
<p>Most people regard history books as genealogies of emperors of past dynasties. The writing style is almost the same, recording the major events that happened each year, or narrating one dynasty after another. A relatively new writing style is to divide the entire history into several stages, writing one stage after another. In fact, these writing styles are not the most ideal, because history is a whole, continuous. Even if we want to divide it into several eras and stages, it is only for the convenience of research. We must never look at history piecemeal.</p>
<p>Recently, a book written by Pu Ren, "Two Thousand Years," can be said to break the traditional method of writing history. It outlines the history of China's feudal autocratic era for over two thousand one hundred years. The author selected the more recent two thousand years from the entire five thousand years of Chinese history to narrate, because this period of history has a particularly great impact on the lives of people today. As for the writing style, it is completely different from other books. It treats these two thousand years as a whole, and provides some questions worth studying.</p>
<p>Although there have been great changes in each dynasty during the more than two thousand years of history from the Eastern Zhou Dynasty to the fall of the Qing Dynasty, our country can divide it into several stages and study the political, economic, cultural, and ideological characteristics of each stage. However, from the perspective of the political form based on the nature of the social economy, they all belong to the era of feudal autocracy. The author grasps the basic commonality of each stage, abandons the horizontal cross-sectional view, and examines the development process of this period of history from a longitudinal cross-section. In order to correct the general public's vague concept of time in history, this book reorganizes the concept of time in Chinese history based on the Gregorian calendar, and lists a table in the first chapter, "Aerial View of Two Thousand Years," filling in some of the major events mentioned in the book into the "Chronicle of Major Events" section, which can help us gain a clearer impression of the time course.</p>
<p>In the two thousand years of feudal autocracy described in the book, China did not always maintain the scale of a unified empire. On the contrary, the period when a unified regime ruled the entire territory was not as numerous as the Qingjiang period. Sometimes, part of the territory was occupied by foreign tribes, or several regimes were formed to confront each other, leading to the division of the territory. However, the essence of the social, political, and economic aspects during this period has been stagnating in the stage of feudal autocracy. Tracing its causes naturally has its social, economic, and political background. During the long period of feudal autocracy, what the vast majority of people suffered was the pain caused by foreign invasions, wars, and divisions. There were very few periods that could truly maintain peace and unity and truly promote cultural development and economic prosperity. If you want to ask why this is so, then the book emphasizes everywhere: due to the unsound and unreasonable social, economic, and political aspects.</p>
<p>After reading this book, we will perceive from the bloody historical facts exposed by the author how the Chinese people living in the era of feudal autocracy groaned under the oppression of the rulers and invaders, how they struggled to fight for their own freedom and liberation, and how they looked forward to the future history unfolding a new path of survival. At the same time, because of the internal contradictions of feudal autocracy, how it showed the inevitability of its collapse and demise is also deeply portrayed in the author's writing. He analyzes the ruling power and its institutions of feudal autocracy, and then discusses how the unit of the agricultural society, the countryside, became the economic foundation on which the rulers' power relied. Because of the peasants' awareness, all kinds of rebellions and disturbances occurred one after another, and the invasion and aggression of foreign tribes became an unstoppable force.</p>
<p>This book includes the following important narratives: (1) How autocratic emperors were produced, how they were inherited, how dynasties changed, and how they caused internal disputes among the royal family. (2) How the bureaucratic system became corrupt and harmed the interests of the nation and the country. (3) How the emperor, in order to consolidate his throne, was worried about the people seizing military power, and how he used military power to maintain the special status of the rulers. (4) How the peasants in Chinese history depended on the land for their livelihood, how the landlords, bureaucrats, and nobles supported themselves by the labor of the peasants and the harvests on the land, and how the tillers of the land, the peasants, lived a life of enslavement. (5) How the peasants consciously stood up and launched wars, and pointed out the reasons for their failure and their historical significance. (6) From the rise and fall of the various tribes outside the Great Wall, it tells the reasons for the unrest on our border, the difference between invasion and being invaded, and how the dynasties still could not avoid failure. (7) After the barbarian cavalry stepped into China, how "puppet emperors" and "two ministers" and heroes who saved the country emerged, and how the monarchs and ministers who fled south despised "the state." (8) How the reform movement could not truly solve the political and economic problems at that time, and how feudal autocracy could not escape the fate of failure.</p>
<p>From this, we get a lot of powerful inspiration: the development of history should have its inevitability. The ancient historical events and our current real life are indeed closely related. Just like the social changes of more than two thousand years written in this book, they coincide with the current social situation. What the vast Chinese people need today is exactly the same as what the people of China needed in history, urgently looking forward to the emergence of a rational and sound society. At the same time, we also have such a firm belief: those who are benevolent to the people but leave the people will inevitably escape the fate of collapse. This was the case in the past, and it is still the case today. The power of the people is like a hot current, and it will become the main force in promoting history and creating history.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Reading "Sexual Psychology" <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Originally by Japanese: Ellis, Translated by Feng Mingzhang</p>
<p>Wen Zhai Publishing House, 4th Edition, June 1945</p>
<p>In this bustling and complex city, if you browse those newspaper stands and small bookstores, you will definitely see many books on sex guidance and sexual health, disguised under the name of education, to deceive young people. If you are deceived by it, there will definitely be that kind of impure thought, and a dose of poison will be infused into your brain.</p>
<p>Because of this, the general public looks down on all books about "sex," as if this book is dirty and not worth a look. Of course, there are also those who are born noble and bound by China's ancestral "moral" views; or some because there are too many books with disguised faces as mentioned above, so they infer that anything with the word "sex" is unclean, and seriously ignore this knowledge.</p>
<p>As the wheel of the new era is moving forward, we can no longer tolerate the above concepts. For every new youth, the demand for this knowledge is also an indispensable subject among all sciences.</p>
<p>At present, we can see Ms. Qiu Si's translation of "New Theory on Sex Education" and this "Sexual Psychology," both of which are very pure knowledge readings. I remember that the publishing industry has introduced the former. Now, I would like to introduce this book to all my young friends.</p>
<p>This book has been warmly welcomed by the medical community and the general public in the United Kingdom and the United States. Books on this kind of sexual knowledge are very popular in the progressive countries of Europe and America, only in this moral China, there is that kind of unnecessary contempt.</p>
<p>Ellis said in the preface to the reprint: "The most critical criticisms of my book have not denied its value. I feel that I can still confidently let it go out. It is an introductory book for studying the most important aspect of life."</p>
<p>As the author said, this is knowledge of "studying the most important aspect of life." The author has written seven major books on "Research on Sexual Psychology" and this concise "Sexual Physiology." The focus of his works is on the normal phenomena of sex, without emphasizing any one aspect, which is especially noteworthy. People in general (whether normal or abnormal) all have the value of reading it together.</p>
<p>We know that sexual psychology is closely linked to social relations; although this point is not commonly noticed, we can probably believe it very much. A young person's entire outlook on life will be transformed due to various sexual phenomena, which has already produced a serious relationship with society. Especially after the war, in the state of economic turmoil, the phenomenon of sexual depravity is especially prone to occur, and the impact on society is even more unfavorable.</p>
<p>In this book, it states the "biological basis of sex," and gives detailed explanations of the natural basis, the nature of sexual impulse, sensuality, the biological analysis of temptation, and the factors of the spouse. The sexual impulse of adolescence; marriage; each part uses many chapters to analyze and give readers a kind of intellectual enlightenment.</p>
<p>In the meantime, for sexual perversions, "Naxi" sorrow, sex education, suitable marriage, complete marriage, monogamy, birth control, chastity, the art of love, sublimation, etc., they are all explained with appropriate examples.</p>
<p>The problems listed in this book are more detailed and most important in sexual knowledge. This book is not a book with a disguised face, but a book that actually guides and explains "Sexual Psychology."</p>
<p>Universities generally do not have subjects in sexual psychology, as if it is not related to the field of animal life at all. Therefore, once a serious disease caused by this occurs, some people are sacrificed in vain in "ignorance"!</p>
<p>This phenomenon is probably not a small number of times we see it!</p>
<p>In short, the knowledge that should be possessed, what our youth must seek naturally is social science, history, geography, and philosophy, and outside these scopes, we should also pay attention to this common sense of a field of life problems!</p>

<p>— By Nikolai Chernyshevsky, translated by Shi Mi</p>
<p>When Vera was sixteen, she stopped attending school and began teaching. This was arranged by her mother, who also wanted her to dress beautifully to attract the attention of young gentlemen. At this time, the landlady's son, Mikhail, had taken a fancy to her and was ardently pursuing her. Vera's mother also thought this was a good match and tried her best to bring them together. She told her daughter, "Live a life of plenty! In today's world, the dishonest and wicked are happy. This is the truth... We live in the old system and cannot live according to the new ways... Therefore, we have to follow the old order, use others, and deceive others. You have to do the same. You must seize opportunities and deceive..." But Vera did not think so. Since being influenced by a French romantic woman, she began to understand the true meaning of love. Coupled with the landlady's opposition to the marriage due to social status, Vera was able to deal with them calmly. Soon after, on her birthday night, she first met Lopukhov, her brother's tutor. He began to fall in love, and later they secretly married. Lopukhov promised her absolute freedom after marriage. When her mother found out, she flew into a rage, but that was all. They lived in a small house, supporting themselves entirely by teaching, though not very wealthy, they were harmonious and happy. Later, Vera organized a sewing cooperative for women workers. The business went smoothly, and she fairly distributed all the profits to the women workers. She told them, "Some people want to build a beautiful house, others want to plant beautiful trees, or build a greenhouse to please the eyes. As for me, I want to organize a beautiful sewing factory to bring joy to my soul!" — Among the women workers, Vera was always their kindest leader.</p>
<p>Once, Lopukhov fell ill, and his friend Kirsanov, a young doctor, cured him. After that, he became their most frequent visitor. His gentle words, his actions, and his attitude became a permanent memory in Vera's heart. She was especially captivated by his rich artistic knowledge. They often spent time together, enjoying a beautiful inner life. She was in love with this elegant doctor, but she was miserable about it. Lopukhov knew it very well, but he did not express jealousy. In order to abide by his beliefs, he continued to comfort her kindly. Therefore, Vera decided to abandon this superfluous feeling and no longer meet with Kirsanov frequently.</p>
<p>Finally, Lopukhov fulfilled his wife's wishes. On the night he stayed in a hotel in St. Petersburg, he was said to have jumped into the river and committed suicide. Vera was very saddened when she heard the news, and she said, "I hurt him." So she resolutely decided to leave the young doctor and find a life elsewhere. In fact, Lopukhov did not die. In his last letter to Vera, he wrote, "I did not commit suicide. I just want to escape prying eyes and give you a new path. Strive to love Kirsanov. He is worthy of your love. You should be happy. As for me, a major task needs me. I want to lay a cornerstone for building a free Russia." The story ended like this. Vera, with tears in her eyes and a grateful heart, forever blessed the husband she had once loved.</p>
<p>"What Is to Be Done?" was written by Nikolai Chernyshevsky in 1863, while he was imprisoned. Shortly after the book was published, he was exiled to Siberia. For the next twenty years, he lived this difficult life of exile with pride. His noble personality had touched countless people. As Ba Jin said, "He hoped to give young men and women of the time a direction in this novel, telling them what they should do." The protagonists of this book are not heroes or supermen. They only apply the conclusions of their own observations to morality. They deny all past traditional customs. Their attitude is so natural and simple. What they believe in is shown in their behavior. They advocate personal freedom, rights, and creativity, and also tend to common good and the happiness of all people! This is the characteristic of their lives.</p>
<p>Chernyshevsky also wanted to solve the women's problem here. He wanted to show us the pursuit of deserved freedom and the right to acquire knowledge. The new female type cannot tolerate the shackles of tradition! From his own works, he created a model desired by women, indicating the concepts they should have and the path they should take.</p>
<p>In addition to the amazing brilliance of thought, Chernyshevsky's works have no special literary contribution. He never uses the beauty of words to emphasize the atmosphere of the story. He is so simple and unadorned. He is so ordinary and unremarkable in terms of plot development and writing skills. That's how he is! Valichevsky once said that he lacked artistic and poetic color. This is very true. He may not have had this intention at all. What he requires is the power of the work itself — to explain his own theory.</p>
<p>Although "What Is to Be Done?" is an old work, when we read it now, the essence of the author's thought still emits unparalleled brilliance. In these eighty years, what new progress have we made in human society? How much have we understood the true meaning of life and happiness? Especially for the women's issue, what enlightenment have we gained? We are just copying the lifestyle of the previous generation, compromising, distorting or burying our own personality. In love, we have lost the sacredness and dignity, and become slaves to disguised transactions. Eighty years ago, Chernyshevsky was imprisoned in a cold hell in order to seek new answers. And today, a century will pass, but we are imprisoned in our own miserable "heart prison" suffering!</p>

<h3 id="e167">Resuming the "Literary Tea Party" <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>In June of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), Sun Chuntai (Fu Xi) edited "Small Contribution." In the fifth issue (June 5), Chuntai raised the question, "What to do on Sunday?" In the sixth issue (June 6), Zhang Limin and Shen Xin raised the same question. Then, Wang Geng in the seventh issue (June 7) asked, "How do we use summer vacation?" The author advocated "promoting the Sunday Tea Party" in the twelfth issue of the journal (June 12), referring to the French salon-style tea party. This "answer" aroused great resonance. At 4 p.m. on June 19, 1932, at No. 3 Huailong Road Garden Villa in Shanghai, the first "Literary Tea Party" was held at Chuntai's residence, hosted by Mrs. Chuntai, Liu Xueya. Participants included: Hua Lin, Sun Chuntai, Liu Xueya, Wang Yachen and his wife, Li Weijian and his wife, Zhang Yiping and his wife, Xu Zhongnian and his wife, etc. This meeting was salon-style, hosted by Chuntai and his wife. The second "Literary Tea Party" was held at 3 p.m. on June 26 at the west wing of the Xinya Restaurant. This meeting laid the foundation for the essence of the "Literary Tea Party," that is, it released its personality.</p>
<p>At that time, even until today, fourteen years later, the "Literary Tea Party" was a thoroughly democratic and thoroughly free group: its popularity lies in this. The author said very clearly in his article "Promoting the Sunday Tea Party": "I don't want the gathering to have any form. What's more, we want to spend this Sunday happily. If we want to put up a pretentious framework and elect a chairman and secretary, wouldn't that be terrible? If we want to use the name of a research society, that would be like leftover Zongzi meat from the Dragon Boat Festival next year – today happens to be the Dragon Boat Festival – its stench is unbearable. As for the name Friendship Association, it can be used; but in the Friendship Associations that have already been established, I often encounter things that are not friendly or righteous: this name is ominous, it is better to remove it... We are all professors or students with nothing to our names. We don't need anyone to treat us. We treat ourselves: everyone contributes money to buy tea and snacks, wouldn't that be great!" In summary, the characteristics of the "Literary Tea Party" are: (1) eliminate all formalism, come if you want, leave if you want, free and unrestrained; (2) break all utilitarianism, do not attempt to "use" others, and do not want to be "used" by others; (3) promote pure friendship, make friends with literature and art, seek half a day of joy, and pour out the accumulated depression in the heart; (4) advocate noble altruism, editors can contact writers for manuscripts, gallery hosts can discuss exhibitions with artists, etc., as well as organizing small-scale concerts, giving lectures, hosting literary and art workers who have come to Shanghai, and even the simplest of chatting.</p>
<p>If everyone loves to breathe pure and free air, if someone admits that friendship without utilitarian colors is noble and valuable, if we still value human dignity and do not want to degenerate into abacuses, then a meeting like the "Literary Tea Party" must exist! It must develop! And the "Literary Tea Party" did exist and did develop. At first, the meetings were held every Sunday in a different place, and then they were fixed at Fulu Shou. Each time, the number of people was dozens or hundreds. Sometimes, someone would treat us: for example, Mr. Xu Langxi, the former president of Xinhua Art College, Mr. Xi Guansheng, the owner of Guanshengyuan, and other gentlemen. I happen to have a small photo taken when Mr. Xi Guansheng treated us. The participants in that tea party were (written at random): Zhang Beiying, Yu Feng, Chen Aiwen, Xu Jianru, Ms. Xu Huifang, Wang Yachen and his wife, Wu Zuoren and his wife, Sun Chuntai and his wife, Zhang Zhongxian and his wife, Jiang Wenxin and his wife, a French couple, Wang Yachen, Xu Shiqi, Xu Weinan, Lang Luxun, Lu Danlin, Sun Biwu, Li Yansheng, Gong Linyi, Fan Cunzhong, Chen Lingxi, Gao Fang, Hu Wenzao, etc. Mr. Xi Guansheng, the host, and the author himself, a total of forty-five people. I can't remember why Hua Lin, Huang Tianpeng, Chen Chengyin, etc. did not participate that time? We traveled to Suzhou; in the tenth issue of the first volume of "Literary Tea Party", there is Zeng Jinke's "Return from Paradise" and Sun Fuxi's "Literary Tea Party Held in Suzhou," recording this trip. Several times, we hosted foreign writers or artists, such as the Italian painter Mr. Janon: Sun Fuxi wrote "Mr. Janon, a Good Friend of China" in the fourth issue of the second volume of "Yifeng" (April 1934), recording him and his exhibition. We expanded the scope of our friendship and even held the 169th tea party at the Jade Buddha Temple on Binlang Road, respectfully inviting Master Yuan Ying to give us a lecture: "Buddhism, Literature, and Art," with 150 attendees; because there were many French guests, the author interpreted Master Yuan Ying's lecture: That was on July 7, 1935. The "Beijing Political News", a French weekly in Peiping (August 31, 1935), published several photos of that tea party. Not only in Shanghai, but also in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Chongqing after "August 13," we held similar "Literary Tea Parties": in Nanjing, it was called "Literary Club," held every Thursday evening, hosted by Hua Lin, Zhang Beiying, the author, and Chen Xiaonan; in Hangzhou, it was also called "Literary Tea Party," centered on Hangzhou Art College, hosted by Sun Fuxi; the "Literary Tea Party" in Hong Kong was held in Chen Fushen and Wang Shaoling's "Four-Person Studio" in Kennedy Road, Mid-Levels, Hong Kong - at that time, Sun Chuntai traveled between Shanghai and Hangzhou once a week, and I traveled between Beijing and Shanghai once a week. As for the tea party in Chongqing, it was called "Star Six Tea House," initiated and hosted by the author, Lu Juewu (i.e., Lu Mang), and Hua Lin; - recently, Hua Lin has revived this "Tea House" in Shanghai. The friendly publications of the tea party in that era included: "Literary Tea Party," which we took turns editing; "Miro Weekly" and "Miro Series," edited by Hua Lin, Sun Fuxi, Huang Tianpeng, and Xu Zhongnian; "Art Life," edited by Xu Zhongnian (the literary column of the publication was called "Literary Tea Party" and "Sunday Literature and Art"); "Yifeng" and "Small Contribution," edited by Sun Fuxi; "New Fort," edited by Li Yansheng; "Society," edited by Chen Lingxi; "Huaan," edited by Lu Xizhen; "Central Daily News Supplement," edited by Hua Lin; and "Qingguang," edited by Huang Tianpeng. I stayed in Chongqing for more than nine years and only returned to Shanghai for sure on August 12 this year; people and things have changed so much that I have not yet sorted out the books: the historical facts of the "Literary Tea Party" known to me are limited to this, and more detailed narratives will be available in the future.</p>
<p>Since returning from the war, we public educators have had several common feelings: (1) busy, busy, busy because we are poor, we are poorer and busier than before the war; (2) transportation is more difficult than before the war, it is not easy to see friends; (3) we have no rest all day long, and there is no way to rest, we are too nervous! So I thought of the "Literary Tea Party," which has been seemingly intermittent on the surface, but only transformed in essence, and did not come to an end in the past fourteen years. After consulting with several old "tea friends" Hua Lin, Wang Yachen, Sun Fuxi, and Chen Chengyin, we decided to revive it. Last Monday - exactly one week ago - Chengyin invited me to lunch at the "Fifth Floor Restaurant" on the fifth floor of the Daxin Company. He talked to Mr. Chen Guolin, the manager of the building, about this matter. Mr. Chen enthusiastically agreed and was willing to help:</p>
<p>(1) Every Sunday afternoon from 4 to 6 p.m. is the time for the tea party;</p>
<p>(2) A special hall will be set aside for the tea party venue;</p>
<p>(3) Each guest will pay two thousand yuan for "tea" and "snacks" (actually eating four thousand yuan worth of tea and snacks), and the participants will pay themselves.</p>
<p>Mr. Bao Chengde, the chairman of the building, is also a man of elegance and is friendly with Chengyin, so he will definitely sponsor us; and we must invite Bao and Chen to participate, just like Mr. Zhang Danzi, the manager of Fulu Shou back then.</p>
<p>The "Shishi Xinbao" helped us a lot back then. This time, Mr. Wang Jinshan, the editor of the "Spring and Autumn" literary supplement of the "Shen Bao", is willing to participate and volunteer: every Sunday, he will publish "Literary Tea Party Invitation" in "Spring and Autumn" so that everyone knows. In addition to welcoming Jinshan to participate and expressing our gratitude, we also hope that Mr. Yan Duhe, the editor of "Xinwen Bao" and "New Garden", will help us in the same way: we guess that Mr. Yan will not refuse, because the "Literary Tea Party" does not belong to anyone or any group, but is shared by writers and artists, including Mr. Duhe himself.</p>
<p>October 27, 1946 (Sunday) should be the day of the revival of the "Literary Tea Party": old and new friends, why not come!</p>

<p>— Song Zhuping</p>
<p>Children who grow up in the south will never think of what kind of season autumn should be on this near-desert plateau.</p>
<p>Autumn in Jiangnan is just good weather. Lush forests, gurgling streams, and bright red maple leaves mixed in the green forest, everything is so quiet, beautiful, giving people a light, unspeakable beauty. When the evening breeze gently sends the twilight, the stars sparkle in the sky, the farmers freely sing pleasant mountain songs on their way home, and in the distance, the lights lit by every household flicker, and wisps of smoke rise from the chimneys, the earth is hazy, faintly coated with a layer of charming color, which is vague and profound. The evening of autumn in Jiangnan is always so light and quiet, like a gentle and affectionate girl, how endearing this is!</p>
<p>On the frontier, can you imagine? Autumn, a desolate and melancholy day! The loneliness of late autumn will always silently entangle the empty hearts of strangers. The autumn wind brings killing, and the leaves begin to dance with the wind. The fields are so dim, just like the night is coming. There are no maple leaves here, only the leaves of apples turn light red, and this will also be fascinating.</p>
<p>On moonlit nights, the night is extremely quiet, so quiet that you can't feel anything. The moonlight is like water, and the wind quietly sweeps past you, how cold and clear! The sky is higher, blue and clear, like a calm sea. Children who grow up by the sea are used to the vast and boundless, surging sea, and the constant cold moonlight penetrates the hearts of wanderers, can it not arouse homesickness?</p>
<p>After that, the days on this windy and sandy plateau will be more gloomy. The weather is cold and harsh, and the ice seals the river flowing down from afar, which flows into the sea. The wind is like a majestic song, bringing the overwhelming yellow sand from the desert, and snowflakes will also flutter from time to time. Do you love the wind? Or is it snow? They will take you to think very far, very far. If you can fantasize, then think quietly! On the boundless desert grassland, the grass bows its head, a piece of gray and white, a group of wild horses, how tall and handsome! There are also healthy and affectionate frontier girls riding horses without reins and saddles, galloping freely on the grassland like flying, will your heart fly with them?</p>
<p>This is an ancient and barren land, as dilapidated and suffering as other places. In ancient times, there were footprints of nomads everywhere. Later, in a great turmoil, man-made disasters increased. You will definitely think that the people here must be poorer! This group of simple people are renovating the ancient land with their own strength and ancient methods until harvest. They endure this destined misfortune, silently, like the worrying season on the plateau today. However, now it is a little quieter, but quietness will arouse people's sorrows.</p>
<p>I will not forget that there are also many mountains here, but they are not like the mountains in Jiangnan, which are beautiful and majestic. They are exuding the breath of rich loess, and the mountains should be more ancient. Children in Jiangnan will not like it here. There is no such beautiful and gentle sentiment as in Jiangnan. But you should never forget this magnificent frontier with snowflakes and big sandstorms!</p>
<h3 id="e171">On Diaries Again <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Xi</p>
<p>Weng Wengong's diary has some discussions on the people of the current system that are unknown to others. But unfortunately, it is not very detailed. However, by carefully examining it, one can discover many important materials. His father, Weng Wenduan, also had a diary, which was still being printed, and I had seen a transcribed copy, which also contained some rare news.</p>
<p>He had a passage recording the preparation for minting gold coins in the third year of Xianfeng, which was said to be requested by Guiliang (the father-in-law of Prince Gong). He planned to melt the gold bells in the treasury. He found one yellow bell weighing eight hundred and ten catties, one lin bell weighing seven hundred and fifteen catties, and one taicu weighing six hundred and twenty catties, all cast in the fifty-fifth year of Qianlong. Later, they were melted into some gold bars and presented, but there was no follow-up. It seems that if gold coins had been minted and issued at that time, it would have been a major event in the history of the currency system. This event has no formal record, so it is very valuable.</p>
<p>He had served as a Minister in charge of the treasury, and his description of the silver treasury is quite interesting. There was something called Zobao in the treasury, which was the largest and oldest Yuanbao. The heaviest one weighed 1,600 taels, with the inscription "Jiajing Year Ding Buyang Month Pan Nanshan Owner Made." This must have been made by a wealthy household and later confiscated by the government. In the past, the silver cabinets were full of Yuanbao piled up to the roof. To check or withdraw silver, one had to climb a ladder. There were two teacups and a mattress placed on a beam, which could prove this situation. These teacups and mattress were left by the people who were working at the time. Later, there was less Yuanbao, and it was not easy to take them down from such a high place. The new place for storing silver was wooden barrels instead of cabinets. One barrel could hold 400,000 taels, but most of them were empty. According to Prince Zheng, there used to be a tank of mercury in the treasury, but the people in charge of the treasury did not know about it (the above are all recorded by Weng). Government property slowly became private property, and even the emperor's most trusted people had to pretend to be deaf and mute.</p>
<p>There was also the satin library (there is still this place name in Nan Chi Zi, Beijing), which also contained a large silk of four feet eight inches wide and eight feet long, also in the meaning of Zobao, and the large one must come to protect the library. The wall of this library was eight feet thick, and the windows were all iron bars, plus iron fans, which can be said to be strong and cautious. And this time, the library was not finished being checked before it caught fire (event in the fifth year of Xianfeng). Isn't it obvious that the guard was stealing and setting fire to cover up the traces? I don't know how much of the sweat of the silk girls and weavers was buried in the ashes.</p>
<p>The most strange thing is that when checking the West Tenth Library, a centipede bone was found, more than four feet long, with thirty-two feet on each side. A python skin, more than a foot wide and an unknown number of feet long. A toad skin, more than three feet wide and long. A gecko, stuffed with grass, more than three feet long. A tortoise shell, more than a foot wide and twice as long. These must be monsters that were sought out from various places during the Ming Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty enjoyed the country for a long time, and the family law was special. In the wild history, you can see many strange systems, cultural relics, which we cannot imagine.</p>
<p>The West Tenth Library was a total of ten libraries in the Ming Dynasty, which stored silver coins, silk cloth, hardware, pigments, paper, saltpeter, and various libraries, occupying the northwest corner of the imperial city. This area has always been empty and sparsely populated. The Ming Dynasty eunuchs practiced their troops nearby. The Qing Dynasty gradually abandoned it. In the Guangxu period, a part of the local party was taken to establish the Catholic Church, which is now the so-called North Church. There are still some old library buildings, which are very gloomy and dim, reminiscent of the traces of history. The library was besieged by the Tuanmin and shed a lot of blood. Only one saltpeter library still existed until the Republic of China. It is said that it was rebuilt into an affiliated hospital of the puppet Peking University during the enemy and puppet period. The monsters mentioned above, I don't know when they were burned or destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e172">An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 71 <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>After everyone ate some snacks, they indeed felt a little more energetic. Looking at the time, it was almost four o'clock. As the time for the launch approached, the flow of information, telephone calls, and telegrams increased significantly. Around four thirty, everything suddenly began to quiet down. The last sound was the team leader's order to those of us in the office, "The time is almost here. Please review the things you need to do and launch on time." The office also fell completely silent.</p>
<p>I retreated to the corner of the room and sat with my brother Hu, gently asking him if everything was ready. I inspected my own small sword, pistol, ammunition clips, and the contents of my "treasure bag," including bandages, hemostatic medicine, a small package of biscuits, beef jerky, scissors, lighter, Kongming pills, incense sticks, tea leaves, and so on. This was originally a small bag of items we used for guerrilla warfare in the Northeast, prepared as a precaution. Hu's equipment was similar to mine, except he had one less clip of ammunition and a sword, which he considered unnecessary for himself.</p>
<p>At the same time, I took out a small piece of paper and reviewed it again. This paper recorded my and Hu's mission in my own code—1. Patrol, attack, and occupy the puppet government; 2. Hu assists in surrounding Yin's residence, capturing the traitor, (I myself) monitor the completion of the disarmament work; 3. Join Hu outside the city and patrol the combat operations; 4. Return to the office to gather intelligence—. This was the mission we had to complete before twelve noon. Each of us carried three rapid-report assistants to transmit messages at any time and place, constantly maintaining contact with headquarters, fearing telephone inconvenience or disconnection. We also hoped to report back to headquarters approximately every hour; otherwise, we had to explain the reason for not being able to return—.</p>
<p>I silently memorized these four missions and then softly recounted them to Hu, instructing him not to break contact during individual tasks to avoid making me worry about him. He nodded in agreement to each one.</p>
<p>At this moment, it was only twenty minutes before five o'clock. After all the silence, it truly felt like every hour had sixty minutes, every minute had sixty seconds, and even every second had a significant duration. Each small segment of time felt difficult to pass. I think many people have this experience—waiting for a scheduled action under extreme nervous tension—for example, someone who knows a time bomb will explode within twenty minutes, and how excited their emotions must be with each passing minute and second.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Commands must be followed. Currently, we don't seem to be able to achieve this thoroughly. Prestige is ultimately secondary; in terms of administrative efficiency, it's extremely worrying!</p>
<p>The majority of the responsibility for this lies with the authorities in charge. If a matter is carefully and thoroughly considered beforehand, with a concrete and complete plan; if its handling is fair, decisive, and with魄force, without ambiguity or compromise. I believe that not only will commands be followed, but they will also be executed thoroughly.</p>
<p>When the commander and the executor are disconnected, and the will hesitates slightly, "compromise" takes the opportunity to enter. The result is a distortion that festers over time, completely unlike the original intention.</p>
<p>Look at the current outcome of the ban on dance hall managers! Look again at the result of banning rickshaws! The ban on neon lights is just one of many examples.</p>
<p>The outdoor ones are being demolished, but the indoor ones can be accommodated. But have the outdoor ones been completely demolished? If you don't believe me, please inspect Nanjing Road and Linsen Road tonight at the beginning of the evening lights. Some clever people have already interpreted this situation: "This is called Chinese affairs." Now, we are going a step further to complete a basis for this ambiguous situation, saying: Open again when the city's electricity supply is sufficient. This is quite flexible.</p>
<p>The night of the city lies in the lights. Why don't we start by actively increasing the electricity supply? And since we know that passive bans cannot be completely implemented, why bother with this extra effort?</p>
<p>Doing fewer things that are difficult to achieve is also increasing the power of things that can be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e174">How Many People Are There in China? Starting with the Establishment of a Population Census Bureau <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>News reports that our government authorities are planning to establish a Population Census Bureau under the Ministry of the Interior, which may be established soon. This is good news that we have been waiting for for a long time.</p>
<p>How many people are there in China? The so-called 450 million is just an estimated number, which is inaccurate. As for the distribution of gender, age, and occupation, apart from fragmented and piecemeal records in one place at one time, the situation of the national people is unknown. A population census has never been conducted. If you open a volume of international statistical books, China is not included in most of the items. This is a national shame.</p>
<p>In June of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the "Chinese Statistical Society" held its annual meeting. When discussing the proposals, it passed a recommendation to the government to quickly organize an executive body for national household registration and statistics. However, it has not been realized after a long delay.</p>
<p>Governments of various countries established "Population Statistics Bureaus" as early as ten years ago, responsible for investigating and collecting statistics on the household registrations of their countries. They conduct a re-investigation approximately every ten years.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Look at Others <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Xia</p>
<p>The Turkish government conducted a national census in 1927, and again in October 1940. There were 200,000 civil servants engaged in this work, conducting door-to-door surveys. During implementation, all people in the country and foreign residents were required to stay home for ten hours and were not allowed to go out. Residents who violated the order and went out were fined or imprisoned. In case of emergencies such as acute illness and childbirth, it was necessary to report through the police station. All transportation vehicles were temporarily suspended, and stores, restaurants, and hotels were all closed. After the survey was completed, a cannon was fired as a signal, and the public could leave their homes.</p>
<p>In 1939, the Soviet Union conducted a general population census of the entire federation, starting on January 17. The time required for the survey was seven days in cities and ten days in rural areas. Due to the vastness of the country, 500,000 workers were mobilized, of which only Leningrad required 10,000 surveyors and 1,500 supervisors. These workers had all undergone special training beforehand. When conducting the survey, all mobile populations on trains, ships, and stations were simultaneously counted. Among them, a survey team sent to the Pamir Plateau and the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region had already set off three months in advance. They had to climb high mountains and dangerous ridges, risking their lives, to reach certain villages in the mountains. The surveyors sent to the Barents Coast and the Kola Peninsula had to travel 15,000 kilometers by reindeer. The staff working in the Kara Kum Desert established sixteen camel teams to complete the task. Lighthouse keepers living in remote locations and explorers in inaccessible areas were also surveyed and counted one by one.</p>
<p>Other countries such as England, the United States, Germany, France, and Japan have conducted population censuses in the past, and the situation was similar to that of the Soviet Union and Turkey, mobilizing hundreds of thousands of people, acting uniformly across the country, and the people facilitated the work of the staff in every way, so they were able to obtain satisfactory and flawless results.</p>
<p>I hope that China's population census can also be as smooth and perfect as others!</p>

<p>On a certain train, two ladies were arguing fiercely about whether the train window should be opened or closed. They also asked the manager on duty to judge.</p>
<p>One lady said, "If this window is opened, I will definitely catch a cold because of it, and may even die!"</p>
<p>The other lady said, "If this window is closed, I will definitely be suffocated."</p>
<p>The two ladies glared at each other angrily; the manager could not think of anything to answer them. A passenger sitting nearby said, "Hey! Open the window, which will kill that lady, and then close it, which will kill the other lady, and we can be quiet."</p>

<p>— Chun Yi</p>
<p>Recently, many American-made glass cookware have been found on the market, which can withstand burning. This kind of glass has a very high silicon content. One type is yellowish and contains trace amounts of  in the glass composition, but a new type of glass that has recently been released does not contain  and has a slightly greenish color. This glass is called Pyrex glass and is produced by Corning Glass Works. Its softening point is at 820 degrees Celsius, and its linear coefficient of expansion is only 32X10-7, which means that if this kind of glass is heated and the temperature increases by one degree, a 1 cm long piece of glass will only expand by 0.00000032 cm due to thermal expansion and contraction.</p>

<h3 id="e179">The Rebirth of an Opium Addict <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>...Tour of the Opium Examination Institute...</p>
<p>After the restoration of the national territory, the authorities vigorously implemented the opium ban policy. Currently, during the examination period, reports are universally made everywhere. If there is suspicion or denunciation, all are sent to the police hospital for examination. Those who are innocent are released on bail. Those who are found to have drugs are handed over to the local prosecutor's office. All newly registered opium addicts are randomly selected for examination. This humble person, with a sixteen-year history of being on the blacklist, has been legally proven to have left the blacklist as a result of this examination. From now on, a new life begins, and I will write down my experiences to leave a trace in the snow.</p>
<p>From the time I was summoned to the police station to the time I was released on bail, it took a total of five days and four nights. On the first night, I sat and waited for dawn in the police station. The next morning, there was another person who had been summoned and three suspected refugees from northern Jiangsu, who were implicated in an opium case because they came to Shanghai to visit relatives. On the same day, at the same time, we were transported to the Shanghai Police Hospital Opium Examination Institute in Tilanqiao. Upon entering, we had to walk up five flights of stairs. The old guns who were addicted already felt breathless. After arriving at the examination institute, we were asked about our age and the reason and quantity of opium smoking. After reporting in detail, we went to the second room. We had to hand over all the items in our pockets for safekeeping and issue a receipt for sealing. Then we went to the third room. A police officer searched our bodies. Our clothes were taken off one by one for careful examination to prevent smuggling of substitutes. Socks, shoe laces, and trouser belts were not allowed to be brought in. The opium examination institute was divided into east and west rooms for men and women, respectively. There were police officers on duty in front of each room. I entered the room with my clothes in my hands. What I saw was that people from all walks of life were there, coexisting in one room. Before the law, everyone is equal, and I realized the loveliness of freedom. At that time, after I entered the room, a Shandong man came to greet me: "Fellow villager, are you here too? Welcome, welcome. Lie down on the empty bunk. Rest here for a few days. Let's talk and make friends in adversity." I nodded and smiled bitterly at him and sat down to put on my clothes. At the same time, the newcomers also came in one after another, each finding an empty bunk. As I was staring blankly in all directions, I discovered that the famous comedian Pei Yanghua was also here. He was sent from the Old Gate District on the same day. Before long, the night meal came in. Each person had a bowl and a chopstick on the small table in front of the bed. First, small dishes were sent, with one dish per person, but those who were strong grabbed two dishes. The dish was radish soup, and the rice was foreign rice. The Shandong man who was chatting with me ate six bowls in a row, and then left one bowl for snacks. He said while eating: "Damn it, I didn't break the law, but I was caught. Eat as much as you can when there is food. Let's all work together to eat so much that they can't afford the food, and we can get out early!" The Shandong man was eating and talking with relish, but I barely finished one bowl and didn't have the courage to add a second bowl. After dinner, water was distributed. In less than two hours, a nurse came in with a notebook to call names and assign bunks. So everyone, as fellow sufferers, went to bed bored and started chatting. Some asked about each other's backgrounds, and some snored loudly. Around ten o'clock, everyone went to sleep peacefully. As the sky dawned, everyone got up. The first program of the day was to fold the blankets. Everyone sat on the bed and waited quietly for the distribution of the pit tickets. Then everyone who needed to went to the toilet. After brushing teeth and washing up, it was six o'clock, and breakfast was congee and pickled cabbage. The second program of the day was to call names and test urine. Each person had two small bottles. Then they would make fingerprints and seal the bottles. Then the doctor came to check the numbers and ask questions. At eleven o'clock, it was time for lunch. After lunch, the third program of the day was to call names and measure body temperature and record pulse. Those who came first had the possibility of leaving if their names were not called. In the afternoon, opium addicts and opium offenders came in and out. By evening, the whole day's program had passed. Life in the institute did not feel lonely, because we could hope but not hear the daily trials of cases by the court, and we could see the prisoners in the square in the adjacent prison. There were Japanese prisoners and White Russian Jewish war criminals playing volleyball in the starry sky. When everyone was bored, they could listen to Pei Yanghua telling stories for entertainment. It was not easy to wait until the fifth day. I and ××× both had the hope of being discharged, but unexpectedly, when × went out to answer questions in the afternoon and came back, he kept shouting "Bad luck." When asked why, he shook his head and sighed: "I can't go out today, because someone said something about me in the tabloid. I don't know if they are praising me or harming me." Around four o'clock, we were called out and handed over to the original police officers. First, we were given back our belts and socks to put on, and then we collected the sealed items and returned to the original police station to be released on bail, each with our own freedom. Is this the greatest and most valuable page in the history of life? It cannot be unrecorded, so I wrote a record of my experience at the examination institute to fulfill free talk and to commemorate it forever.</p>
<h3 id="e180">About One Year with Thirteen Months, Each Month with Twenty-Eight Days <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Du Zui</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: This so-called scientific calendar has been mentioned before, but it has not attracted attention. We believe that this issue may be worth considering by everyone. If you have any "insights," please write them down and send them to us. We will discuss this issue in next week's Sunday Miscellany.)</p>
<p>How troublesome is the calendar (Gregorian calendar) we use now! What, February has twenty-eight days! July and August have thirty-one days in a row! It's confusing, don't worry, scientists have invented a "scientific calendar" for us. It is calculated like this: Divide the year into thirteen months, each month with twenty-eight days. You will ask again: Three eights are twenty-four, two threes are six..., there are only three hundred and sixty-four days! What about the remaining day? Ah! Scientists have already thought about it for us, the extra day does not belong to 1946, nor to 1947, it is independent, we might as well call it "Happy Day". On that day, the whole world is on holiday celebrating the coming of the new year, this is the calculation method. There are also its benefits, listen to me slowly.</p>
<p>If you are a student, you must be looking forward to the National Father's birthday on November 12, because it is a holiday, you have to flip through the calendar to see what day of the week it is, don't be unlucky and run into Sunday, flip, flip! You are always nervous, you flip to see that it is Tuesday, and you breathe a sigh of relief. Don't say I'm long-winded, you wouldn't know its magic if I didn't say that. If you use a scientific calendar. Haha! It has already calculated it for you, hasn't it? One month is four weeks, then, the 1st, 8th, 15th, are Monday, and so on. Isn't it obvious at a glance?</p>
<p>Another benefit is that salaried people can get one more month's salary, which is a boon for salaried people now.</p>
<p>But "there must be disadvantages if there are benefits". That is always inevitable, what is the disadvantage? Guess. - The best-selling book in the world - the calendar - will have no sales. Unless it is a first-class idiot who wants to buy it. Because, we don't need a calendar at all if we use a scientific calendar!</p>

<h3 id="e181">The Humorous Wu Zhi Lao (Below) <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Feng</p>
<p>Not Self-Destructive</p>
<p>Wu Zhi Lao's writing style has always been known for its sharp and adept delivery. When Wang Ni betrayed the enemy, Wu was the first to write an article denouncing him, so refreshingly that it left Wang Ni completely covered in wounds. He also had a great pen war with Zhang Xingyan, and even issued an obituary for Zhang, which read as follows: "Wu Jingheng and others, unworthy friends, are deeply sinful, not self-destructive, and have brought disaster to our friend, the honorable Academician. The Academician was born in the former Jia Yin year and suffered in the latter Jia Yin year, dying without illness. The unworthy friends and others personally witnessed the burial and followed the ancient mourning rites, felt (not bitter) and collapsed, unable to say more, alas this obituary." It also included several words: "The so-called deeply sinful is a factual record, because ordinary friends are not progressive and cannot actively move forward in national affairs, causing Mr. Zhang to be sad and bored, with no way out, and then went to the horns and into the eighteen-story valley." It can be said that it has exhausted the ability to satirize.</p>
<p>Very Frank</p>
<p>His speeches are also farcical and unrestrained. Once, a conference was held in Nanjing and Wu was invited to speak. Wu came late and said on stage: "I had sexual intercourse with my wife once last night, so I am very tired today and came late, please forgive me!" The audience roared with laughter. When Wu followed Chairman Chiang to Hankou, all walks of life in Wuhan held a conference to welcome him. Wu Zhi Lao gave a speech on behalf of Chairman Chiang. At that time, the weather was very hot. Wu Zhi Lao opened his mouth and said: "When I woke up last night, I found that my pants were soaked. At first, I suspected it was ××, but I didn't have a silly dream, and then I knew it was a lot of sweat."</p>
<p>Wu's humorous nature can be seen from the above, but it often offends people. Once, when the Ministry of Education held a pronunciation unification meeting, he suddenly had a dispute with Wang Pu. Wang was stuttering and irritable, and his reasons were insufficient, so he scolded Wu: "Old bastard, you only know how to laugh and joke, how can you understand phonetics? How dare you argue with me?" The words were extremely embarrassing, and the whole hall was stunned. Wu calmly stood up and said with a smile: "Mr. Wang is wrong! Maybe he is dizzy with anger? Zhihui's surname is Wu, not your family!" The people in the whole hall could not help but laugh.</p>
<p>Many Writings</p>
<p>Wu is fluent in four languages: English, French, German, and Japanese, and has many writings. Famous ones include "Talks on Ancient and Modern Times", "Illustrated Explanation of Natural Evolution", "History of Desolate Occupied Aborigines", "Guest Talks", "Complete Works of Wu Zhihui" and other books. After the Xinhai Revolution, he and Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang and others organized the Association for Frugal Study in France, published the World Pictorial, and translated famous plays against imperialism. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the Scientific Weekly, which he edited, had Wu's articles in each issue, advocating saving the country through science and opposing reading thread-bound books.</p>
<p>This veteran of the party and the state, who is over eighty years old, is still strong. Not long ago, his "Letter to Mr. Zhou Enlai" and the recent speech at the inauguration ceremony of the new chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters were sharp and humorous, no less than in those years. He is truly an "old white-haired youth" who is getting stronger and stronger.</p>
