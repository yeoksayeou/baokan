<h3>平保國軍即可會師　徐水附近激戰中　冀省府將重修平保公路</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕平漢路北段南北國軍昨日已在徐水會師說不確，據長官部消息，北端國軍布置尚在北河店至固城附近，南端保定北上國軍，則已越過漕河，迫近徐水，共軍在徐水集有主力兩軍，正激戰中，保定以南共軍，現仍徴集民夫，積極破壞鐵路。石家莊以南共軍，現已作撤退準備，邯鄲之冀晋豫邊區政府，已遷豫北，邯鄲市府已移邯鄲下戶村。</p>
<p>〔本報保定廿四日電〕保國軍北上極順利，軍事首開親往前綫指揮，平保軍即可會師，本報記者隨軍視察。又國軍在高碑店沿途實施掃雷工作。又關係方面息，最近冀省國軍將增加兩軍，從事保衛及護路工作。</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿四日電〕保定守軍分向南北伸展，北趨者廿三日克漕河，正搶修徐水鐵橋，即可與南下國軍會師。南向者向方順橋反攻，已與共軍展開激戰。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕冀省府以此次平漢北段被　破壞甚鉅，一切器材設備俱感缺乏，縱鐵路打通，短期亦難修復通車，故分爲建應預作計劃，一俟平保間打通後，即動員民工，將被毀已久之平保公路重新修建，利用汽車維持平保交通。又保定·石家莊秩序已臻安定，惟以軍隊供應及興修工事需要籌碼甚切，昨冀省府已派專機一架，運送鈔票赴保·石兩地，爲被圍孤城輸血。</p>
<h3>平綏路完全打通　十二戰區部將移設張垣　由熱入察國軍進駐赤城</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕平綏全綫迄昨晨完全打通，察西國軍收復晋北之天　後，廿三日晨繼將陽高收復，與廿二日收復聚樂堡之馬占山騎兵東進部隊會師，至此，平綏全綫遂告打通。又據平津鐵路局息，歸綏至大同段，即開始積極搶修，張垣至宣化段，已修復通車，惟車少距離亦近，故十二戰區長官部特自廿日起暫以汽車作張垣至康莊間之交通聯絡，每日對開二輛，次日可到，票價爲一萬八千元，康莊至北平已通車，全綫尚有約三分之一待修復，十二區區長官部，即將因傅長官主察而移駐張垣。</p>
<p>〔中央社承德廿三日電〕由熱入察國軍，收復多倫，沽源後，廿三日進駐赤城。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕據悉，張垣物價因法幣尚未大量流入，而遠較北平爲低，此間投機家正百計鑽營赴張，乘機施展身手，單幫商人已絡繹於平綏道上，惟黃金在張似尚未見活潑，久受統制之察省商人，多尚未把穩如何獵此發財或賠帳之轉捩期。爲應市場需要，張垣及宣化市上已流通由商會發行之一百五十兩種流通劵，該劵石印紅字，印刷粗劣，正面有「即日兌換法幣」，及背面註明「俟法足用時即予收回」字樣，但此物並不爲收藏多家或市民所歡迎。</p>

<p>省府向中央提建議</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕冀省府即對處理收復區邊鈔，偽鈔問題，向中央有所建議，內容爲（一）新收復區人民應將邊幣繳存當地政府，同時予以登記，候中央適當規定處理辦法。（二）新收復區殘留之偽聯鈔，自收復起二月內，仍能照中央前規定之五比一比率兌法幣。</p>

<h3>中研院評議會年會　昨下午圓滿閉幕</h3>

<h3>殷逆汝耕昨審結　檢察官列舉罪行請判以極刑　老牌漢奸之死活卅一日定讞</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕老牌漢奸殷汝耕，廿四日在首都高院五次受審。上午十時半，趙琛院長偕庭長葛之覃·金世鼎·檢察官王文俊，書記官胡漢斌，升堂開審。殷逆着灰縐長袍黑呢便鞋，面膄，髮白，惟神態慌張，尤以趙院長以莊嚴這語調緊密逼之，賣其貪生怕死時，殷逆竟期艾錯誤，手足無措，令人可笑，亦復可憐。詢年籍履歷後，庭上先論知其所提有利證據，均已調查齊案，即宣讀棄德純次長親筆復函稱：殷逆組織偽冀東政府，事先絕未得冀察政委會宋哲元胡委員長之默契，事後亦無聯絡；財政部鹽務總局之復函，復證明殷逆在廿三年侵據冀東廿二縣鹽稅，並脅迫長蘆鹽管局陸續取得四百萬元鉅款之事實。旋即依序對其組織偽政權，發行偽鈔，推行奴化教育，助庇走私，以空軍基地，私人武力，及軍衙鑛藏資短短，計劃修治運河，圖謀響應「大東亞聖戰」等罪行加以嚴訊，殷瘦長或推諉，或賴帳，或加狡辯。十二時半開始辯論，檢察官列舉其罪行後稱：「舉國之內，縱三尺孩童，亦莫不知殷瘦長爲老牌漢奸，應請庭上處以極刑。」殷逆乍聞，神情陡變，面色如紙，混身發抖，且頻以衣袖拭目，旋即顫聲自辯，無非「犧牲個人，跳火坑爲國家保存原氣，爭取時間」，「被日人押後，本不擬再做官，但被迫不得不做！」等漢奸論調，且狡稱：「設彼時無人肯犧牲，遽與日本決裂，恐無今日之局勢。渠認檢察官之言均係就目前情形論當年事實，且多屬推測。」繼由章士釗律師起立辯護，章氏並以前冀察政委之資格，現身說法，謂政府當年行二面政治，宋哲元氏忍辱負重，痛苦不堪，殷逆所爲，亦局勢使然，希望庭上能將殷逆行爲，就七七抗戰劃分爲二部審判。後張文伯律師再加補充，至二時許，庭諭辯論終結，定三十一日宣判，被告還押。</p>
<h3>胡適縱談世界事　對國內外大局表示樂觀</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕來京出席中研院評議會之胡適，二十三接見記者時，對世界及國內局勢，成作樂觀看法，連稱「我一點不悲觀！」</p>
<p>國際局勢不應悲觀</p>
<p>胡氏認世界情勢「不錯」，蓋此次戰爭爲人類歷史空前未有之大戰，敵人投降迄今，爲時僅一年餘，欲於此短時期內，一切成復舊觀，事有所觀能，即在國外，情形亦應如此，如美國至今仍感肉食缺乏，罷工　起，余（胡自稱）去歲赴英參加世界文教會時，我代表團住倫敦考究之旅館中，曾三星期未見一雞蛋；惟英美等國，對此感曾作相當程度之向制，因之人民尚不頂苦，例如美國四年之中，房租分文未增，我在美大使館新址，因屋荒關係，深恐爲人挖去，乃自動增加房租，然美政府決不准屋主接受。各國戰後情形有好有壞，然余對世界局勢，並不悲觀，且認不應悲觀。一般而論，目前局勢較上次大戰結束後爲佳，時至今日，幾無一國再願作戰，同時第二次大戰結束後，已有新國際組織產生，大國間誠齟齬不已，然此爲好現象，貝爾納斯，貝文及莫洛托夫間，說話雖不客氣，但誰都不願決裂，誰都不願拆抬。上次國際機構，美蘇皆未參加，目前則大國皆參加，而真正向以侵略爲主義之國家，諸如德，義，日等，則皆無置喙餘地，故余對國際局勢毫不悲觀。</p>
<p>國內情形已有進步</p>
<p>談及國內情勢時，胡氏首謂：適來因忙於北大復員工作，最近又因忙於開會，無暇仔細讀報，故並不頂熱，並重引其在北平時所述之笑話稱：「余對原籍安徽省政府主席爲誰，以前亦不知道。」旋詢記者：江蘇主席爲誰？獲知爲王懋功後，胡氏稱：「陌生得很」，詢以對國是之看法時，胡氏稱：我國情勢亦較過去有進步，余在北平時，該地共黨代表可自由行動，不受干涉，在京遇董必武，其行動亦不受干涉，此爲新氣象，好現象；即就言論而言，亦較過去自由，如新華日報在重慶出版，即其例證。胡氏並鄭重指稱：自由爲一種習慣，須漸漸養成，容忍亦是一種習慣，亦須逐漸養成，現在大家說願說的話，都是好事。</p>
<p>學術前途亦抱樂觀</p>
<p>對我國學術前途，胡氏亦抱樂觀態度，並重申其在中研院評議會開幕日之演詞稱：政府若能給予十年安定，學術必可大有進展，大學教育情形亦屬如此，北大本年在九處舉行考試，（三处係与清華，南開等校聯合招生。）參加者達三萬二千五百人，此次考試成績，足以代表全國各中學之程度，一般而論，成績不惟不能與抗戰前相比，即與抗戰時期或淪陷期間相較，亦見遜色，主要原因，爲此一年來學生咸在選播中，生活不安定，功課當退步，可見安定對學術之重要性；然八年之抗戰，予學生豐富之人生經騐，使彼等深知生活維艱，求學不易，此點對彼等求知，當亦有助，因之目前成績雖較差，就余本人論，不甚悲觀。</p>
<p>今後仍將從事著述</p>
<p>胡氏對渠本人今後著述，計劃，亦曾約略談及，略謂：一俟開學，一切上軌道後，可少攬些行政事務，從事著述。記者詢以「中國哲學史」下冊何時可殺青？胡氏先謖材料已蒐齊，何時續寫，尚難定；其後又謂，該書將整個不要，擬重新寫過，並將改名「中國思想史」且表示最近對專題研究較感興趣；至「白話文學史」也亦擬重寫，並將改名爲「中國活文學史」。</p>
<p>最後記者又詢渠對於蔣廷黻去職一事之感想，胡氏一再謂：「此爲一最可惋惜之事。」胡氏對蔣氏推崇備至，惟謂，蔣曾表示擬略事休養，下學期回校執教事恐難實現。</p>
<h3>首都居，大不易！　房東不顧政府法令任意榨取　外國使館考慮遷滬或擬裁員</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿四日電〕首都多數房屋租借期滿，居戶接到房東或經租帳房通告，增加租金達數倍之多。拉丁美洲某外交官，其大使館住宅，於一年前租借，每月租金三百美元，現房東要求漲至一千美元。另有甘大使館職員住宅，租金亦要求自二百五十美元漲至三千美元。其他外交團人員，亦遭遇同樣危機。當局雖頒佈房租管理條例，限制新屋租金不得超過造價及地價百分之二十，舊屋租金不得超過民國廿六年十月之五百倍，但南京房東置之不顧，任意榨取。外交團若干人員已考慮裁員，或將移駐上海。某大使告聯合社社者稱：渠已向本國政府建議減少大使館人員至最低限度，而令其餘人員返國。南京市政府對於實施房租管理條例，一籌莫展，甚至國民政府亦無法使租金合理或合法化。例如中宣部欲照規定房租租賃賓館一處，以備招待外國記者，找尋數月無着，終於出每年租金法幣五千萬元租得一屋。市當局擬建築大小公寓，爲公務員解決房荒。國民大會則擬徴用各大學宿舍，解決二千零五十名代表之住宿問題。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕偽海次李逆慧濟，廿四日下午六時經國防部軍法司判處徒刑十年，被褫奪公權六年。</p>
<h3>東北球唯一特產　台灣花蓮港　蘊藏石綿礦</h3>
<p>〔中央社花蓮港二十四日電〕花蓮港（位於台灣中部東海岸）石綿礦，爲東半球唯一特產，其蘊藏量之富，可與世界著名產地之加拿大相伯仲，產區有豐田及瑞穠兩處，日人於戰事期中，因軍事及工業上需要，曾在豐田進行開採，每年採取五百噸，目下存量尚可供繼續開採二十年，惜已停頓。瑞穠蘊藏更富，惟尚未開採，遽勘測在二十萬噸以上，品質且較豐田爲佳。</p>
<h3>克夫人昨離蘭　飛赴山丹視察</h3>
<p>〔中央社蘭州廿四日電〕克利浦斯夫人等廿四日晨八時自蘭飛抵張掖後，即乘車轉往山丹視察工合培黎學校，定廿五日返蘭。夫人行前對谷主席之熱忱接待表示感謝，據稱：渠所親見之蘭州，逈非其意想中落後之西北城市，蘭州之建設與進步，殊值欽佩。廿四日晨夫人離蘭，此間各界首長均曾到機場送行。</p>

<h3>社論　從演詞中看世界的遠景</h3>
<p>聯合國大會前天在「世界的首都」紐約開幕了。世人對於這次聯合國大會的前途，雖不敢過分樂觀，但是聽了杜魯門總統所發表的歡迎辭，頓時發生無限的希望，對亽聯合國大會必能成功的信念，也益形增强了。綜合杜魯門總統的演辭，要點有六：第一聯合國機構不在解決當前的問題，而在設法維持將來國際和平；第二美國對於維持和平，具有不可動搖的信念，願出全部資源爲聯合國機構的後盾，決不恢復以前孤立派的態度；第三聯合國各會員國不得以武力干涉他國之領土完整及主權獨立；第四任何一國發動侵略，均須受國際法庭制裁，此項崇高的原則雖已確立，但尚未能完全消滅世人對於未來戰爭的恐懼，故聯合國尚須成立協定，以採取更積極更具體之行動，使大小各國均能共享合理的和平；第五美國各項目標志在防制戰爭，覓致真正的和平，促成四大自由（即故總統羅斯福所倡導的言論自由，宗教自由，免除匱乏之自由，暨免除恐懼之自由）的實現；第六盟國應立即商訂協定，解除德日兩國的武裝，務使法西斯主義不能抬頭，再從事侵略，故盟國應即起草對德對日和約，亦已刻不容緩了。</p>
<p>世人在巴黎和會開會期間，看到盧森堡宮內波瀾迭起以及各國代表悲觀的神情，對於戰後世界的前途，都不免要發生些感慨，內心雖企求和平的迫切，而希望聯合國機構能成爲維持世界和平有效的工具；但是對於它的估價，終不敢看得太高，而且國際聯盟的陰影，又常常在世人的眼前出現，提高了世人對於聯合國機構的警覺。但是聽了杜魯門總統的一席話，就種疑慮頓時冰釋，好像獲得了一重可靠的保障，足以保證聯保國機構決不會際聯盟的覆轍。國際聯盟雖然也是大戰後的產物，其目的也在促進國際合作，以維持世界和平；但其性質，和現在的聯合國機構，截然不同。第一國際聯盟雖爲美國故總統威爾遜所發起，但在國際聯盟開幕的會場上，並沒有美國的代表出席，誰也不能否認，這是國際聯盟的致命傷。美國既然採取了孤立主義，國際聯盟自難成爲維持世界和平的有效工具。所以國際聯盟的失敗，決非偶然的。第二是蘇聯在國際聯盟成立後的最初十年間，一直置身於國際盟的門外，至日本破壞盟約之後，蘇聯也揚起和平外交的旗幟，外交人民委員長李維諾夫，始在萬國代表的鼓掌聲中，踏進這一座有名無實的「和平之宮」。但是在今日的聯合國機構，不僅美蘇兩國都參加在內，而且均已成爲聯合國機構的兩大台柱。美國國務副　艾契遜歡迎各國代表說：「美國已將權論聯合國機構爭其一貫的外交政策」，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫抵紐約後也說：「蘇聯代表團對於此次聯合國大會，必能有所貢獻。俾使其完成工作，以增進和平利益以及全世界　各國人民的福利。」所以聯合國機構得有美蘇兩國的全力支持，必能完成其維持世界和平的任務，決無疑問的。</p>
<p>在杜魯門總統的演辭中，雖未涉及美蘇關係，但其呼籲聯合國各國通力合作覓致和平，蘇聯自亦在內。本報廿三日社論曾指出今日世界政局的重心，完全在美蘇關係上，聯合國大會成敗的關鍵，也完全在美蘇關係上。英國首相艾德禮前天在下議院發表演說，亦必　英蘇兩國爲避免第三次大戰的浩刧起見，有一怕得合作之必要：美國國務卿貝爾納斯日前也表示，美國人民已向蘇聯伸出友誼之手。使我們益加相信防止第三次大戰唯的途徑，乃在美蘇兩國的密切合作，杜魯門總統既謂美國所有目標，志在防止第三次大戰，則美國對於蘇聯友誼有取得，必將加倍努力。同時我們更認爲，美蘇兩國在思想上制度上，雖爲截然不同的兩種國家，一爲資本主義的民主國家，一爲社會主義的蘇維埃國家；但是在目前，不論爲美蘇本身的利益計，或爲整個世界的前途計，都應該通力合作，共同維持世界和平。戰爭不僅是世界的毀滅，而且也是美蘇兩國的浩劫，均屬有害無益。所以聯合國大會在紐約充滿了祥和光明的氣氛中舉行，美蘇兩國政治家，咸能在大智大仁，捐棄成見，釋嫌修好有絕在的可能。記得莫洛托夫行抵紐約時談稱：「余相信真誠與好意，必能達到相互諒解，任何困難，均可迎刃而解。」我們正期待着美蘇兩國均能以真信與好意，謀得雙方的互相諒解，而將目下國際上的陰霾一掃而空。</p>
<p>美國的政局，最近亦因商務部長華萊士與國務卿貝爾納斯在外交政策中發生裂痕，而引起軒然大波，商務部長雖由故總統羅斯福的忠實信徒哈里曼繼任，但是外界對於杜魯門總統是否仍恪守羅斯福的遺志，依舊懷疑在胸；無法消除，可是前天聽了杜魯門總統的一番話，「美國的各項目標，志在防止戰爭，維持世界真正的和平，而促成四大自由的實現。」便可以完全放心了，並可相信，美國現行外交政策，正遵循着故總統羅斯福所指示的途徑，向着這四大自由的目標前進。外國所有的指摘，不是說美國懷有帝國主義的野心，就是說美國運用金元外交，企圖達到某種目標，凡此各種論調均可不攻自破，實在用不着再予以駁斥了。</p>
<p>戰後世界走向和平的步伐，雖然非常遲緩，一年半來，開了不知多少次的國際會議，其結果僅僅制定了五部和約草案；但是僅有這一點成就，也已足够鼓勵世人了，和平的前途仍舊是光明燦爛，而且第二步驟，就是對德日兩國締造和平，杜魯門總統也很率直地指出，兩國應即成立協議了。因此我們希望四國外長定於十一月四日在紐約舉行會議。討論對德國問題時，大家都能以真誠與好意謀得各方的諒解，把意見上的紛歧縮小到最小限度，即能成立對德和約；然後再締造對日和平，俾使戰後的世界早日恢復正常狀態。</p>
<p>要而言之，杜魯門總統所發表的歡迎詞，足以激勵各國人民對於和平的信心，同時美蘇間的緊張局勢，也可以因此而起漸趨於緩和；使目下的國際局勢展開一幕美妙的遠景；但是這幕遠景能否實現，而不致幻滅，則將望美蘇兩國的政治家能否言行一致而定了。但願美蘇關係從此好轉！</p>

<p>拒用公庫支票質詢</p>
<p>我是本市鄉區的一個公務員，同時兼辦事務工作，因爲職務上的關係，常常要和一般商人接觸，以致引起許多麻煩，最嚕囌的，要算公庫支票了，非要哀求苦惱再三說項，才肯接受或在票背上蓋個戳子。如最近到中正東路富豐紙號，要求補蓋八九兩月份交易過的支票，他們非但不肯，而且卑鄙的說：「我們號裏不收公庫支票，根本不要做這種生意，爲啥當時不來蓋。」等語。先生！公庫制不是我們自己創造的，也頂使我們頭痛的，譬如本月份的經費，需要在月底甚至下月初始可發放，除薪給零用金外，一律要蓋店家圖記，方能領出。我們機關離滬三十餘里，來次上海要化不少錢，到市銀行代理公庫裏去，還要送駐庫審計人員審核，弄得不巧，要等上二小時才拿到錢。所以彙集二三個月的發票請商號補蓋，這也是我們不得已的苦衷啊！現因這種情形，迫使我提出下列二個問題，請有關各當局指示：</p>
<p>（一）商號拒收）公庫支票是否合理，有何法可以補求，可否請崗警執行（因爲公庫　度是國家法令頒佈的）？</p>
<p>（二）本月份購買物品一定要本月份支票，那祗有請求財政　會計當局，將經常費請在每月「號發放。否則使我們墊也不敢墊，因爲墊出的錢商號過了時間不肯蓋章的啊！（浩若）</p>
<p>請決發勝利紀念章</p>
<p>我國有史以來最光榮的一頁抗戰勝利史蹟，可說是名留千古，永垂萬世。這史蹟所換來的代價，也就是我們軍人用頭　，洒熱血，苦鬥沙塲，轉戰南北東西，吃盡千辛萬苦！在這八年的過程中，只有我們軍人曾飽嘗這種滋味，誰都能公認的。</p>
<p>政府製發「抗戰勝利紀念章」及「勳章」，目的在獎勵有功人員，我們雖然是沒有特殊功績表現，抗戰八年來從未有離開過部隊，萬里長征，登山踄水，露宿風餐，槍林彈雨，流血流汗，這些情形，我們也可以稱得上「抗戰將士」的美名，並不是自誇自詡的。</p>
<p>前月本隊報領是項紀念章，須要銓敍部任官任戰的，才可以發，否則沒有，我們對於任官任職，曾經都任過，甚至連任數次的也有，名冊呈送上去請領，差不多一個多月了，迄今否無音信。我們現在是退投退職，不久就要回歸故土，但是在外參加了八年抗戰，這次如果回到家鄕，對一般親朋戚友，沒有一點抗戰身份的表現，自覺慚愧！敬請當局趕快把「抗戰勝利紀念章」發卞，毋任翹企之至！（中訓團第十七總隊七大隊四九中隊退役退職官佐啓）</p>

<h3>聯大開始一般辯論　縮短發言時間四日可結束　蘇聯反對修儘管五强否決權</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約弗魯辛廿四日電〕聯合國全體大會，於昨日正式揭幕後，今日已開始進行一般會務，大會主席史巴克呼籲各代表縮短演說，故料一般辯論，四日即可結束，然後當由六個主要委員會着手處置世界重大之問題。今日之辯論中，任何代表均可就任何渠所選擇之題目發言。安理會內墨西哥·埃及·荷蘭三席理事之任期，到本年底屈滿，常由本屆大會選舉繼任之理事，當選呼聲最高者爲比利時·哥倫比亞·及叙利亞·莫洛托夫對杜魯門總統之呼籲，表示熱烈之呼應，使許多代表產生東西裂痕可以消滅希望。外交界人士復覺國際決議，可由調和之意見而成立，不必經由表決否決之途徑。然若干代表則覺蘇聯或當使南斯拉夫或某一其他小國加入安理會，以便會同波蘭增强斯拉夫集團在安理會中之勢力。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿四日合衆電〕杜魯門於聯合國大會發表其睿智之詞後，已於午夜返華府，大會開幕式之後，蘇聯即開始與欲求改變五强否決權者搏鬥。本日草洛托夫已對其他大國提出警吿謂，蘇聯準備要求大會或指委會，拒絕對否決權問題進行全部辯論。五强以外之古·菲·澳及其他國家，均努力求否決權之完全廢止，或於憲章中明文規定限制其蓮用。如蘇聯在十四國之指委會中，企圖阻止否決權之辯論果能成功，則古巴等國之努力將全屬徒然矣。昨夜委員會之非正式會議中，蘇代表維辛斯基曾稱，蘇聯反對大會臨時議案中之五項規定，此五項均係有關否決權者。維辛斯基之反對，未能獲得英美之支持。杜魚門昨在其演說中，已明白表示美國贊成就否決權作充分討論，甚至修改否決權，英首相艾德禮在下院中亦表示贊成檢討否決權，使其符合起草憲章者之原意。今蘇京廣播會攻擊艾氏爲「和平之敵」，因其乃尋取否決權之限制也。古巴建議召集五十二國代表會議，自憲章上删去否決權之規定，此舉維辛斯基表示反對，設法禁止其列於議程中。</p>
<h3>主席斯巴克述大會主旨</h3>
<p>培養相互瞭解美德　共同推進重大任務</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿三日專電〕聯合國大會主席斯巴克，於大會申述大會之主旨，並與其他代表共同熱烈呼籲，設法增進及產生「普通之國際精神」及培養「相互了解之美德」，而以二者爲此世界機構之出發點，因而推進其重大之職責。此短小精悍之比外長斯巴克並坦白宣稱，國際合作前途，障礙尙多，惟此等障礙供可克服。渠復解釋稱，吾人之目的均屬相同，但吾人之反應及思攷討論之方法，則常難永久一致。吾人彼此間有種族性情之不同，故對直接之利益，亦有時發生抵觸，國際前途有種種阻礙，若忽視此事，一貫爲荒謬且亦危險。但此等障礙，殆非慷慨智慧及絕對必要所不可克服者。</p>
<p>期氏並吿知全球人士稱，舉世之第一流外交家均已敍集於此，從事「覓取吾人個別利益之均衡」。渠建議下列之工作方式，即以任吾人嘗試工作，工作非徒託空言，乃採取健全方法，以獲致具體之結果。蓋結果乃明確而眞實之事，而彼期待與且在焦慮中之人民所望於吾人者，亦即此也。余等應避免作冗長之一般討論，而應以坦白勇敢敏捷之態度，討論一切問題。斯氏並對懷疑聯合國機構者，提出有力答案稱，渠等是否能建議任何較聯合國更佳善之組織，縣等是否尙不明悉此一進退維谷之事，乃實甚簡單，若非吾人成功，即世界又將陷於混亂紛擾，且終將發生戰爭。先是斯巴克曾歡慶美蘇二國於聯合國中均採積極之行動，而不若第一次世界大戰後之採取孤立政策。繼對杜魯門總統于蒞臨大會之首次會議，深致謝意，並對美故總統羅斯福之功績深表追念。</p>

<p>〔本報特派員紐約廿三日電〕聯合國大會今日在紐約正式開幕。中國首席代表顧維鈞方自華盛頓抵此，渠身穿灰色服裝，出席大會。代表郭泰祺係於星期一自巴黎抵此，穿黑衣服裝，坐於顧氏之旁。在開會前，兩位中國外交能手曾不斷懇談。其他中國代表爲外次劉錯，張彭春博士與謝晋麟亦均出席。中國代表之座位排於第三排之中間一行。中國新聞記者的有十人出席，包括華僑發行之中文報紙之記者在內。</p>

<h3>會塲花絮　杜魯門與莫洛托夫熱烈握手互致祝賀</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約二十三日電〕杜魯門總統本日在聯合國大會演講完畢後，步經莫洛托夫面前時，莫氏以俄話向杜總統招呼，渠稱，「莫洛托夫願衷心爲總統之演講致賀，渠認爲此項演講甚偉大。」杜氏答以「余極表感謝。」此爲去年莫洛托夫出席聯合國組織大會路過華府，與杜魯門會晤後之第一次重晤。開幕禮較預定時間遲十五分鐘，因等待主席斯巴克向大會所致開幕詞之英譯本也，綠斯氏演詞之譯本，係置於聯合國在成功湖之臨時會址，信差取來時，在門口與安全衛隊爭持半嚮，始被允進入會塲。出席今日會議之各國代表之姓名，一若國際人名辭典，其中有總理，首相，部長及大使等，外長人數逾二十名，唯一之皇族爲沙她阿拉伯國王之子及外長斐什爾親王。杜魯門總統雖爲出席今日會議之最顯赫人物，但實際受人注意者，則爲貝爾納斯及莫洛托夫二人之動態。蓋此二人乃目前所謂東西集團爭執之象徵也。大會開幕後，莫洛托夫即離塲由外次維辛斯　領導蘇代表團。貝爾納斯則以參議員奥斯汀領導美代表團，會塲前排爲三强代表英國第一，其次爲蘇聯，美國第三。五百名代表與副代表中，有十二婦女代表，最具聲名者爲羅斯福夫人，薩爾瓦多遣派兩女代表，其餘九國均派遣婦女代表一人，即中，印，巴拉圭多明尼加，厄瓜多，紐西蘭、古巴，慮森堡及巴拿馬。</p>

<h3>難民託管否決權三項　四强政策之檢討　聯大會中必有一悉劇烈爭執</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿四日專電〕此次聯合國大會之成功或失敗，端視各大國調和渠等國際政策之能力如何而定。各大國之政與，其主要者，均將於難民，託管及否決權三大問題之辯論中表現之。下列諸項係就目前所獲之徵象，對美蘇英法於世界議會中所欲完成之各項目的，作一簡括之說明。（一）美國在否決權方面，美代表團對蘇聯之濫用否決權，將有所譴責，美國無疑將支持否決權之應用，必須有所節制。託管方面，美國將阻止大會於日本和約簽署前，判定現由美國佔有之前日本委治諸島之命運，又如美國將是項島嶼於聯合國託管理事會統治之下，僉信美國將堅持聯合國有監察託管領士之權，此點或將與蘇聯政策引起衝突，因蘇聯或將考慮獲得託管領土對表面之監察權，不致表示歡迎也。難民方面，英美及蘇聯就建議中世界難民組織之經費，及流亡人民歸本國之權利問題，無疑均將再起辯論。（二）蘇聯在否決權方面，蘇聯將强烈抵制任何取銷或改變否決權之企圖。關於難民問題，除非世界難民組織拒絕援助聯合國難民營中蘇聯之政敵，則蘇聯將不予難民以經濟協助。尙有二項問題，蘇聯將盡力堅持者，一爲美軍隊退出「非敵」國，另一即擯絕弗朗哥西班牙於一切聯合國特別機構之外。（三）英國在難民間題方面，將向美國堅强聯合要求，立即成立國際難民組織託管聯合國難民營中之流亡人民，關於託管，英國將堅持及早成立託管理事會。對否決權英國將支持五强一致之規則，並將建議將憲章中規定否決權之條文，作進步之解釋，以避免其濫用，（四）法國在否決權方面，僉信法國將堅持其否決權。關於託管問題，法國將以首先向聯合國提出託管協定者之地位，於討論託管問題時，盡緩衝調解之事，對弗朗哥西班牙，法國將支持蘇聯之立塲，因法國竭力反對弗朗哥西班牙之加入任何聯合國機構也。</p>
<h3>破壞雅爾達所作保證　蘇在東歐大量駐軍　邱吉爾向政府提出驚人質問</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿三日合衆電〕邱吉爾今在下院演說，譴責蘇聯破壞其在雅爾達所作之保證，並對蘇聯在東歐佔領區維持二百餘師以上「置於戰時地位」之軍隊事，加以抨擊。邱氏稱，在希特勒時代較之今日尙易感覺及預測，若干事件之一般動向，吾人今日不必謀如何對付希特勒及其殘酷之反猶太主義之納粹黨徒而反猶太主義乃其主旨之所在，吾人今日之所遭遇者，較之「我的奮鬥」一書中所明白佈署者，並更難於捉摸。吾人今日之所遭遇，乃一集合之思想，其行動之來由，吾人無從斷定。在克里姆林公中，有精明能幹之士十三人或十四人，彼等握有整個蘇聯及歐洲三分之一以上之控制權。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿四日電〕英國反對黨領袖即前首相邱吉爾本日在下院發表演說，以蘇聯軍隊兩百師駐紥歐洲是否確實爲問，政界觀察家認爲此乃邱翁之狡計，欲使政府窮於應答。外次麥克奈爾險中其計，蓋麥氏倘答稱政府對於此種大軍之駐紥，並無所知，則邱翁定將追問此項情報之透露是否將改變政府之政策。反之，麥氏倘承認此項數字確實，邱翁又將追問政府對於此種兵力之集中，是否將採取對抗政策，以防止歐洲發生武力衝突。麥氏殆欲答以鑒於蘇聯民主政治之進步，此一數字並不特別令人警恐，但麥氏僅稱蘇聯在歐洲雖駐有大批軍隊，但渠並不與邱吉爾同樣悲觀。並稱，渠對於邱氏所述數字表示懷疑。</p>

<h3>英首相發表演說　猛烈抨擊共產黨　謂使各國間發生隔膜與猜忌　學爲世界大局前途悲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：英首相艾德禮今日在白雷頓城英總工會大會中發表演說，竭力抨擊共產黨。渠稱，「凡拒絕接受共黨之命令者，均被斥爲法西斯份子。凡共黨佔有優勢之地，即爲民主，反之，共黨失勢之處，即目爲法西斯。例如希臘選舉在國際監視下舉行，結果反共派佔優勢，共黨即肆意攻訐之。反之，在共黨得勢地方舉行之公民投票，則譽爲神聖之民意，蘇聯政府似蓄意欲使蘇聯人民與其他人民隔離，實爲世界大局前途可悲，蘇聯報紙對於國外情形，故作不符事實之宣傳，使各國間發生隔膜與猜忌。世人或以爲蘇聯制度最與工人有利，宜必歡迎各國工人密切聯繫，而事實上背道而馳。此一種政策殊可遺憾，吾人不禁希望蘇聯有以改變之也。</p>

<h3>英商電車工潮又起　市長限令今日復工　勞方所提要求應進行合法調解　煽動工潮者已下令逮捕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕爲英商電車昨日總罷工事，吳市長特於昨午四時半在市府會議室接見各報社記者，報告經過之事實，並限令於今晨一律復工。綠英商電車此次罷工，起因於與資方談判之決裂，本年九月廿四日，勞方提出四項要求：（一）要求發給子女教育費，每職工貸學金十萬元。（二）公司收賬員英商底薪爲四十元，法商爲四十四元，要求與法商電車公司同樣待遇。（三）要求調整開車賣票員之太平賞，以生活指數計算。（四）內勤機務部工人，要求發給制服。上項要求提出後，雖屢經談判，但未有結果。職工會乃於前午召開代表大會，決議於廿四日下午二時起，公開「請客」。不料昨晨當電車開出時，有工人四名，攔阻各路電車，不准出廠，在彼等之號召下，即實行總罷工。</p>
<p>本人認爲公用專業之職工，應有服務之精神，而英商電車公司爲枝節問題，一月中竟罷工三次，實無理已極。而工人四名，於昨晨竟敢公然阻攔電車是項行爲實屬妨礙社會秩序，觸犯刑法第一五三條之罪（以文字圖畫演說或他法公然爲左列行爲之一者，處二年以下有期徒刑，拘役或一千元以下之罰金，（一）煽動他人犯罪者，（二）煽惑他人違背法令或抗拒合法之命令者）余已命令警局逮捕此四人，送法院依法辦理。同時並已警告該工會，自二十五日起必須一律復工。勞方所提要求，即使談判決裂，亦應歸社會局勞資評斷委員會調解，罷工「請客」，皆非合法之舉動云。</p>
<p>最後市長又鄭重聲明：而今罷工之風氣，已喪失社會之同情。本人今日特提出「罷工容易復工難」之口號，若英商電車明日）即今日）再不復工，即作自動解雇論，將來再要求復工，決無如此之容易。且公司當局，得審核工人名單，對於品行惡劣之搗亂份子，可不予核准。上項意見，全憑中立地位而言，絕無偏袒云云。</p>
<p>會後，有記者詢問以軍人無票乘車之風氣，將如何取締。吳市長謂：將與警備司令部聯銜佈告，嚴禁軍人無票乘坐。</p>
<p>又吳市長謂：本市蘇州河之米碼頭工頭制度，實施不合理，據傳每袋米之搬運費爲三百元，而工頭則須抽二百十元，工人實際到手者僅九十元，此種吃人制度，必將予以改善。</p>

<h3>上海扒窃党的黑幕（五）</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>探囊取物　不翼而飛</p>
<p>扒手黨「做生意」時，都是三五人成一小組，多半衣履整潔，彷彿似商人或學生模樣，凡是人頭機動，乘客擁擠的地方，最是他們的理想去處。老資格的扒手，能夠使失主神不知鬼不覺，直等到回家後，方才發覺。他們用小刀片割破了失主的外衣，接着還割壞了滿貯錢　的腰帶。（初式商人每藏鈔於關邊的皮帶中。）把鈔票都偷光了。扒手黨有一種迷信，說是要扒便得扒光，若餘下多少不扒，將要生不利的事。</p>
<p>他們還能利用烟幕彈來遮掩客人的視綫，例如用報紙一遮，第三隻手便在報紙下面伸到客人的衣裳上去，有時叫同夥將客人的呢帽推落地上，只等着客人彎腰抬轉時，扒手便乘機施行　手了。</p>
<p>近十年來，一般人都喜用手袋而褲棄掛曩，這是扒手黨們最痛恨的事，因爲手袋牢牢地紥在左手上，簡直無法移動。若在早前金掛　盛行時，體面人物，莫不人人樂用，尤其是西裝朋友，把金錶鏈露在背心口袋外，氣派十足，到處傲視，照料轉瞬之間，便已落入扒手手中。用薪興的代替品也就跟踪而來，那便是懸掛在西裝外衣小袋上的派克等牌自來水筆，這種名貴的美國貨，十幾年前已風靡了全上海，價格不論新舊，都是高得可以的，脫手易而扒取便，此種扒竊名爲「吃鋼筆」，又稱「喫大劃」。</p>
<p>偷竊銅筆如果當場失風，或是來不及匿起便可能被人覺察，扒手們此時，便得機警萬分，將鋼筆拋棄在地上或電車板上，立即踢在一旁，那裏早有同夥等着撿起，將原筆奉還原主，反而可以得到失主的稱讚呢。</p>
<p>碼頭活動軟硬兼施</p>
<p>「跑底子」乃是分發在碼頭輪埠活動的「扒竊黨」，「底子」那是「船」的切口。上海原顯繁盛口岸，在黃浦江冀州河兩岸，碼頭星羅棋怖。在戰前，每日在輪埠停靠出入的船隻，其數量之多，簡直不勝枚舉。在此種地段活動，自然利益優厚，但如此肥缺，早有神通廣大的三十六個黨霸佔地盤，區區「老弟兄幫」屬下的「扒竊黨」，到底實力薄弱，牌頭不硬，自然不能爭一日之短長，可是利之所在。扒竊黨決不放鬆，但老弟兄幫中，也祗是「有面子」的爺叔輩，方才有插足於「跑底子」的活動。同時還須有特殊勢力以保衛其所佔的碼頭，避免同行的侵略。這一來便需要運用手腕，軟硬兼施，並利用「放交情」的交際術，在同類中選拔幹才，引爲「共扒弟兄」，儘量安插後進，使爲己助。手下黨夥愈多，面子自亦愈有光彩。於是進可以攻，退可以守，在地盤內伺隙找錢，故此輩無論是「爺叔」以至「小鬼」（夥伴也），莫不身手靈活，衣冠整潔，否則不能在船埠上活動。</p>
<p>水陸並進拿手傑作</p>
<p>「跑底子」幫的活動分爲三大門類：</p>
<p>「堆窰」——「堆窰」乃是貨棧的切口，所有由船上起卸及由貨棧裝船的貨物，偷竊事件，都是本幫弟兄們的拿手傑作。原來凡是貨物起卸，當經過碼頭時，「堆窰」小組三五成羣，便趁那起卸忙碌之際，在大包袋外沿，施行「零拆碗菜」的割取手腕。雖然所取無幾，可是集腋成裘，其利潤實亦可觀。貨主即使得知，亦以損失有限，不致斤斤計較，如果整件扒竊，貨歲及負責人便須受累賠償，難免要發生衝突。</p>
<p>至於搬運伕役眼見包件被割，爲什麽不加攔阻？有經驗的搬運伕，以血汗易取工資，又何必去得罪壯冀　　。反正他們對貨主並不相識即使維護得力，貨主也絕不會「傳令嘉獎」，反使老弟兄們懷恨在胸，馬上會聚眾行兇，給你「顏色」看。若是貨物已經由貨棧運上駁船，駁船還靠岸未開的時候，這是千載一時的良機，老弟兄便老實不客氣偷起整件貨色來了。因爲此時貨棧已不負責，而損失乃屬於貨主或是船戶。其偷竊的路綫，不外水陸兩途，多數是用小划子運走。自然此舉總有些帶着危險性，時常需要全武行演出。有經驗的船戶，爲了免生麻煩，事先常與「爺叔班子」打通，允許經費若干，以保安全。「爺叔」自然樂於享受此種「太平俸祿」，而且還自命爲「放交情」呢。</p>
<p>恐嚇詐騙　哭笑俱全</p>
<p>「滿口扒」——乃是向走私者施行敲詐的統稱。上海碼頭走私之風，向來甚盛，此種多數可以口頭論價成交，故進益優厚，又無須大動干戈，幾乎完全是外交技術。但從事於此道者，必需積多年經驗，有銳利眼光，見有運載私貨及違禁品者，便挺身上前問訊，船戶作賊心虛，只好化錢塞口。私貨違禁品的種類及幫中切口如下：</p>
<p>品名　切口</p>
<p>烟土　黑老</p>
<p>私塵　白老</p>
<p>走私米穀　酒珠</p>
<p>走私劣質輔幣　古槍螺絲</p>
<p>走私劣質銅元　黃梁子</p>
<p>槍械軍火　板頭</p>
<p>槍彈　連心</p>

<h3>兩路舞弊案宣判　卅六被告中僅五名無罪　張鴻圖郁香巖　各判刑十五年　張伯康十二年經偉鈞等十年　各犯贓款一律追還</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬區鐵路管理局材料處舞弊案，經地院審結，昨日上午十時。在第八刑庭宣判。在押被告張鴻圖，郁香巖等十三名，於九時半由看守所提到，交保在外之被告二十三名，僅到八名，代理律師二十二人則均出庭聆判，旁聽席擁擠如昔，審判長梅爾和推事偕書記官鐵昌饌，準時出庭，經梅推事對各被告逐一訊過姓名，年齡，籍貫，住址後，即起立宣讀判決主文：「張鴻圖，張伯偉康經鈞，陳景曜，莊人懋朱必聞，張開源，張澤隆，朱培宗，顧振民，俞培恩，夏定武，孫學三，李潔，徐傳貴，蔡志道，何祖恩，郁香巖，於仲潞，金雲亭，曹祖新，李汾賓，吳蓮慶，夏兆楨，余康候，楊文禮，沈運生，周錦華，徐炳洪，俞毅夫，李行信，共同連續對於主管之事務，直接圖利，張鴻圖郁香巖各處有期徒刑十五年，褫奪公權十年。張伯康處有期徒刑十二年，褫奪公權十年，經偉鈞，王人懋，朱必聞，張開源各處有期徒刑十年，褫奪公權十年。陳景曜，張澤隆，朱培宗，俞培恩，顧振民，夏定武，徐傳貴，蔡志道，何祖恩，各處有期徒刑七年，褫奪公權七年。孫學三，李潔，於仲潞，金雲亭，曹祖新，李汾賓，吳蓮慶，夏兆楨，余康候，楊文禮，沈運生，周錦華，徐炳洪，翁毅夫，李行信各處有期徒刑三年六月，褫奪公權三年。石庭耀，王雲仙，沈會卿，施慶祥，析鼎甫均無罪。</p>

<p>梅推事讀畢主文，又以和緩之語調，解釋稱：「路局材料處採購科職員，連絡商人，利用職務上之便利，非法收取佣金，或以借貸方式取得財物，連續數月，構成懲治貪污條例第三條，第六款之罪，故一併處罪。如對所判不服，或引用之條文不當，可於接到判決書後十天以內，聲請覆判」。語畢聞即宣告退庭，處刑最重之前材料處長張鴻圖，郁香巖夫婦，昨日毫無表情，態度極爲鎮靜，唯張伯康開判後，精神頹喪，幾搖搖欲倒。據各被告律師表示：皆嫌處刑太重，將提上訴，尤於商人付佣金亦以貪污共犯論罪，認爲上訴後當可減刑云。</p>
<h3>陳納德空運隊　今晨簽訂合約　飛虎隊担任飛行工作</h3>
<p>由陳納德將軍負責主持之行總空運大隊，經過幾番磋商後，已得行政院之批准，陳納德於週一晋京，與有關方面商討。經過三日之議談，雙方對合約內所訂各點，已大致解決。陳亦已於明晚返滬，定今日上午十時半，在行總簽訂合約。合約內容將於今日簽字後公開發表。據陳昨日對記者稱：渠在滬將與行總及有關方面再詳細討論該空運隊今後之工作，及經費問題等。該空運隊之性質，與普通航空公司不同。其主要工作專爲協助行總運輸救濟物資。行總結束後，此空運隊亦同時結束。至於聯總所供飛機十二架，以及行總所供經費二百萬美元，均尚有待。渠本人亦將設法向各合作者籌募經費，目的爲一百萬美元。俟一切問題解決後，即將在沁簽訂合同，開始工作。該空運隊隸屬行總之下，爲行總服務，故與商營航空公司，逈不相同。參加該項工作之飛虎隊員，已有一部分自美來華，担任飛行方面之工作。</p>
<h3>爭運魚鮮糾紛未已　菜場昨日無魚應市</h3>
<p>本市三輪車與卡車，爭運魚貨之糾紛，因調解尚未協議，暫由魚市場自雇卡車運送，迄已數日，一面正由有關各方洽商妥適解決方案，詎昨晨四時許，魚市場多數魚貨，均已完成交易，正在分別運送之際，突發生停市風潮，當時人多口雜，所有成交待運之貨，亦未克出運，紛紛要求退貨，致各菜市場昨日無魚應市。而滯積市場之魚鮮，則因不克及時售出。反致無謂損失，可謂橫生枝節，市場當局，以數日來奔走接洽，已煞費苦心，今此變端，實出於意外云。</p>
<p>魚販聯益會謁市長請願</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨午四時，魚販業同人聯益會之會員百餘人，組織請願團，聚集於市府門口，請求當局制止三輪車夫糾衆搗亂。並推吳啓定，趙志祥，胡榮富，俞鏡青等四人爲代表，晋謁市長，申訴經過情形。吳市長親予接見，聆悉原委後，即表示此案當交社會局警察局會同辦理。</p>
<h3>財政預決算委會　今日開小組會議</h3>

<h3>兩路職工　要求調整待遇　列隊請願　局方已允考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬滬杭兩路職工，昨日向局方提出調整待遇要求，下午職工代表數十人，在辦公廳大廈前廣場中，列隊請願，局對於職工要求已允考慮。據陳伯莊局長語記者稱：兩路職工待遇，較之其他鐵路已屬較佳，機工低級每月約十六七萬元，非機工打八折，低級每月約十三四萬元。現職工方面請求參照郵電工人待遇，局方向抱「大公無私，忠勤爲國」之態度，惟工人肚子當然先要吃飽，故如目前待遇確屬不能維持生活者，自當呈准交通部酌予提高。</p>
<p>陳伯莊晋京</p>
<p>〔又訊〕兩路管理局局長陳伯莊，昨偕秘書孫亞夫晚車赴京，晋謁交通部當局。聞係對兩路路政有所請示。</p>
<h3>澳皇后號輪抵滬　載來乘客三百餘人　勾留一夜今晨離滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昌興輪船公司澳洲皇后號郵船，昨午抵埠，停靠虹口公和祥碼頭，載來乘客三百七十七名，無貨裝來。該皇后號來滬，非但戰後初次，即戰前亦未來過，因向行駛於大西洋英國加拿大之間，遠東太平洋迄未行駛，此次係服役而來，定今晨駛日載調防之英軍返國，故進出口手續，均由大英公司代辦，昌興公司並不過聞。該輪總噸三萬八千餘噸，煙囱三支，外表異常偉大，現尚爲服役運輸艦，故全身完全灰色，均爲戰時設備。</p>
<p>美輪來滬尚須有待</p>
<p>〔又訊〕美國海員二次罷工，蔓延全國，異常嚴重，所有船舶幾全停航，迄逾一月，尚未解決。二十二日本市航商，曾得舊金山廣播，有罷工解決之消息，經向美商航業機關探詢，據稱迄未獲得電訊，又謂即使解決，船隻因須裝卸貨件，一時恐亦不能即開，胡來滬之船舶，尚須有待。本市美輪最近有去無來，逐漸減少。美國總統公司至昨日止，停泊滬上者僅六艘，福來公司祇一艘，連其他之美公司船，總數不滿十艘。</p>
<p>據悉總統公司明日將有一輪到滬，名紅手套（Red　Gountleh）號，係罷工之前離美，聞運來大量汽油棉花等商貨。</p>
<h3>熊貓遺骸　施行解剖　兩博士親自動手　今午將繼續進行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕熊貓遺骸，原定二十二日解剖，後因準備不及，改期昨日在舉蘭路二號公務局國場管理處，由中央畜牧實騐所病理研究專家鄭慶端·秦禮讓兩博士動手，美軍克寗漢上尉及東吳大學生物系主任標本專家徐蔭祺博士均到場。但因熊貓遺骸水藏過久，肉身硬化，故僅在腹部劃開約八英寸長之毛皮後，即因工具不全，無法繼續，改期今日下午在虹橋路二百號中央畜牧實騐所再行解剖。</p>
<h3>兩路路政　亟需改良　負責人員談計劃　欲想鬆動等來年</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕中國有句老話：「在家千日好，出門一步難」。這一種不長進的消磨人志氣的思想在「天下一家」的今日當然不容我人再有；可是，看到眼前國內的交通情形，實在不能不令人視爲畏途！</p>
<p>遠的不談，以京滬滬杭兩路的情形來說，凡是有過買票乘車經騐的人，差不多人人都有極大的不滿，兩路過去是辦理最上軌道的交通機構，爲什麼現在竟是如此糟糕？難道中國經過八年抗戰，一切都抗得退化低能了嗎？</p>
<p>原因從深處着眼，還是牽涉到整個國家的根本問題。管理當局固然不免有人謀不減的地方，但是他們也在訴苦。他們會提出一連串的數字來證明實際困難在於車輛少乘客多。譬如說：戰前貨車有四千多輛，現在僅有二千多輛，其中並且被津浦路借了八百多輛去。戰前客車有三百七十輛，現在祇剩了二百四十二輛。戰前有機車一百六十一輛，現在祇剩了九十三輛，而乘客呢，統計戰前每天約在一萬二千人左右，現在則達三萬人至四萬人之多。</p>
<p>路政當局的理由自也有其不可抹殺的事實性。乘客擁擠的現象中還包含一個嚴重的生活問題——「單幫客」的活躍。以京滬路的情形來說，南京的若干物價遠較上海便宜，豬肉在那裏祇一千多元一斤，在上海則賣三千多，一轉手可以賺到一倍有餘，而所費的火車票混合車四等僅僅一千多元，特快車三等也不過四千四百元，因此不少單幫客大筐小籮的帶了鮮豬肉到上海來出售，帶鷄蛋鮮魚的也有。我們常常在夜裏看到北站大廈中有席地臥突的短衣人物，他們大多數就是想等着一清早買票的爲生活而奔走的單幫客人。從維持秩序保持清潔的立場看，他們似乎有被取締之必要，但是從另一個角度看，我們無論如何也不忍使這麼多人斷絕他們的生路！</p>
<p>售票處開窗時間的規定和購票時長長的行列同樣是受旅客非難的中心，不過路局方面的解釋說是爲了免除黑票的猖獗，雖然買賣黑票的情形至今並未絕跡，一張四千多元的三等票黑市有時賣到一萬多元。除去所有這些似乎難於澈底改善的現象以外，售票處職員的辦事效率路政當局至少應該也必需隨時加以嚴密的督察。</p>
<p>據負責人談：兩路枕木從一九〇二年英國舖設一直到現在已有四十多年的歷史，由於長期使用及戰爭期內之破壞，其中不少已腐爛損毀，因此影響到現在的行車速率。最近該局已開始一個修復計劃，將更換枕木四十萬根，預定在明年二月間可以完成，那時京滬間飛快車四小時半可以抵達，每日行車班次亦可大爲增加，對於疏運旅客當可大爲改善了。</p>
<h3>市政府交響樂團　舉行特別演奏會</h3>

<p>〔傅況鱗律師答〕（一）查抗戰期間，淪陷區與自由區，郵務交通，從未斷絕，原妻是否生死不明，不難一查可知，以此爲再娶理由，殊欠充分。（二）須得原妻同意，否則不可。（三）應負重婚責任。（四）最近並無關於解決此類婚姻糾葛之新法令頒行。（五）離婚後子女之扶養，依法由夫任之，但另有約定者，從其約定。（六）本件女方無過失，依法應給與相當瞻養費，至女方死亡或另與他人結婚時爲止。</p>

<h3>棉布標準已審定　根據紗價計算成本再審核　批發利潤爲廠價加十二％</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午三時，社會局召開棉布價格審定委員會第二次會議，出席者社會局顧處長，市參議會趙公馨，紡建公司陳家振，六區紡織公會廠光第吳漱英，市商會諸尚一，染織業步伯勳陸潤金，棉布業　久峯貝在榮等，由顧處長主席，報告吳市長對於平抑紗布價格之決心，以及本會所負使命之重大，至本會所負之使命，爲（一）審核合理之價格，（二）消滅黑市，同時對於上屆通過之章程，應仍用規程字樣，一面對各單位委員，應既確定，以便隨時召集會議。</p>
<p>審議價格，當由棉布業　久峯諧，對於棉布價格之審定，似應以大路繁銷貨爲標準，照目前銷貨論，似應以（一）十二磅細斜紋，（二）十二磅白平細布，（三）一九〇號絲光士林，（四）元嗶嘰爲標準，樂無異議，至價格一項，據黃久峯報告外匯調整前後之市價，（一）十二磅細斜在匯價未調整前爲五萬四千元，最高九萬元，現市八萬至八萬二千元，（二）十二磅細布，匯價未調整前，爲五萬六千，最高十萬七千，近日七萬八千至八萬元，一九〇絲光士林，未調整前爲九萬二千，最高十五萬，最近爲十三萬五千，綫嗶嘰未調整前爲七萬，最高十二萬，現市十萬零二千。</p>
<p>次由染織代表步伯勳云，照目前以上四種布疋成本，加以說明，十二磅細布確實成本，至少需八萬八千三百八十元，十二磅細斜八萬元，一九〇絲光士林十五萬一千，嗶嘰十一萬六千，布業　代表所報告之市價，尚不敷成本。</p>
<p>顧處長以棉布及染織業代表所述市價及成本，當極正確，惟爲合理抑平布價計，自應慎重商定，當經委托染織業根據紡管會所核定之紗價詳細規定成本廠繳以及合法利潤，造具詳細報告，送社會局，再由市商會市參議會會同調查確實後，於下次會議時，再行討論。棉布業染織業出席代表，共同提議，規定棉布市價，應有彈性，照原料之高低分別核定，於由市商會諸尚一謂，棉布價格之規定，不僅原料，其他工繳捐稅利潤均須一一核計在內，方爲合理。</p>
<p>旋討論棉布批發商利潤，一致決定以出廠價格，加百分之十二爲批發定價，最後顧處長表示，現在對於棉布價格，既已有出廠價格及批發價格之大體規定，以後如有廠商及批發商操縱或抬價等情事，自應嚴密規定處罰辦法。</p>
<p>第六區棉紡織公會代表吳漱英以爲在此棉布市價低於成本，各廠號售貨，有虧無盈之時，對處置一項，仍應從異議，但各代表以吳市長既堅決具有抑平紗布價格之決心，對於平價政策，自當一致擁護云。</p>
<h3>配紗技術問題　紡管會開座談會　分類配數繳款等待續商　紗號業亦應造報侯分配</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡織事業管理委員會，於昨天下午三時在漢口路一三〇號紡建會議室，召集染織、針織·內衣、毛巾被毯·手帕·手工棉織等六棉製品工業，及紗布兩業公會，舉行座談會。商討棉紗配售實施上之技術問題，由李副主任升伯，及劉處長文騰主持，當由李氏宣佈，吳兼主任委員已向紗廠業撥定一二·〇〇四件半，照二十支每件一百七十五萬元之標準，自本星期六起，分十五天配售於各棉製品複製工業，由各公會根據前所造册呈報之需要量，以六折計算，先配半數，計開</p>
<p>染織業　七·八一六件半</p>
<p>針織業　一·九〇二件</p>
<p>內衣業　一·〇一五件</p>
<p>毛巾被毯　七二〇件半</p>
<p>手工棉織　四六〇件半</p>
<p>手帕業　九〇件</p>
<p>至於未及造報之復製品工業，如帆布業，以及各公會中未及參加申請之會員，則限於此十五日內，據實造報，由下次參加配給，劉處長並表示，（一）各公會會員生產設備，用紗數量，存紗數量，務須核實報齊，（二）此次配紗，務重實用，責任各公會於配給後，造册報告其分配生產及銷售情形，（三）已經造册申請配給之各廠實情，容有未符之處，責任各公會繼續嚴查，如過申請過分，應切實核減，嗣經各業代表，分別發言表示擁護主管當局之政策，並咸感責任之重大，事務之艱鉅，希望能在紡管會領導之下，通力合作，最後推定潘士浩徐昭侯李道發任兼道等四人，於今晨會同紡建業務處負責人員，興六區棉紡業公會主持人，商談貨品分類，及審核各戶配數標準，興繳款出貨等詳細手續，李氏對於紗號業表示，本市除上開六複製品工業之用紗外，亦須造具調查報告，聽候審核分配，交由紗號業經辦，並謂華南去紗之限制，即將開放云，聞上開六複製品工業，定今日上午在染織業公會　議云。</p>
<h3>公債欲漲無力</h3>
<p>又盛傳「指數還本」説公價昨七八樓各有大戶了結，但指數還本之説復活，新買亦有，臨低補空者稍多，尚呈平庸，統丙晨開二二〇〇元，即被賣戶包圍，逐漸盤低至二〇一〇元，而後稍定，結果較前收微挫二十元，甲乙亦然，統丁小五十元，統戊跌七十元。</p>
<h3>人造絲配售數量不多　市場喊價仍維原盤　下月起可照實需量配售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局代售政府物資委員會昨日循例開售人造絲，計配售絲織業各廠共一百十九箱半。配價一百廿號天橋有光，每箱二百八十萬元。同號什牌每箱二百七十五萬元。惟數量極少，故各綢廠大半未曾派着，即派着者亦只五包至多十餘包，據云自下月起，實行按實需量每月分四次配售。</p>
<p>又紡建公司昨亦開售人造絲，共一百七十二箱。此中織帶廠佔五十一箱，人造絲商號佔一百廿一箱。配價一百廿號什牌有光半光，每箱二百七十五萬元·七十五號金雞半光，每箱二百卅八萬元·一百五十號什牌有光，每箱爲二百五十九萬元。故昨日人造絲市場中喊價雖維持原盤，但無一箱成交，廠經穩中略有疲意，昨D級成交價較上日短五萬至十萬元，E級少有做開，普通貨及干經仍喊上日原盤，交易亦稀，綢貨被面昨又小五萬元，尚乏受主，其餘各貨，均無變化。</p>
<h3>銀根鬆買氣盛　金鈔均告回好</h3>
<p>烚赤昨仍告微挺，晨開二二三萬五左右，人心頗好，實力派有納，自二二三萬二起逐漸上升，十時後央行即以二二四萬二五之價，配給一三〇條，此後銀根仍形鬆濫，近午依然，求過於供，升至二二五萬而後稍平，午刻在二二四萬五左右盤旋，午後　續小穩，隔日交割站定於二二五萬左右，結果較前收好一萬五，飾金升爲念三萬八，紋銀平銀元續低，暗拆銀根更鬆，息價自一角二至一角半不等。</p>
<p>外幣平穩少變，美鈔門市仍爲三五〇〇元有求，暗市中約四一〇〇元至四一五〇元之間，較前收稍昂，港票因連日港市申電期鈔均告徘徊，以致形勢仍定，在八八〇元左右徘徊，較前收無甚榮辱，港滙亦站八八〇元左右，印滙一〇七〇元有供，英滙一四一〇〇元左右，成交甚少，美滙掛牌仍平</p>
<h3>商號禁收存款</h3>
<p>不持存款爲貸放者　可以不在取締之列</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕財部頃行文各地，對「管理銀行辦法」中「收受存款而不稱銀行者視同銀行」之規定，有所說明。即普通商號收受存款，應絕對禁止。惟因調撥款項，辦理匯兌；或因運用資金辦理票據貼現，及以現款貸興有關方面，而非恃吸收存款爲貸放者，均不在取締之列；但仍需有本身業務某一行爲之合法證件，以資證明。</p>
<h3>同行吐售　紗市轉疲</h3>
<p>昨日紗市忽轉下游，報載聊合配銷每月只有二萬四千餘件，各廠多餘之紗，仍傳自由售賣，查配額內民營廠佔三分之二，僅一萬六千件，然民營各廠總產額奚止五倍於此，易習之，民營廠大部份紗綫，仍將流入市場，實貨來源必見大增，因是人心轉淡，同行競相吐售，廿支各牌紗跌三四萬元，細紗始漲終　，結果與昨無大軒輕。</p>
<h3>收購漢口棉花</h3>
<p>公會不便統籌辦理　將由會員個別治商</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局前曾提出收購漢口棉花之計劃，微求六區紡織業公會同意採用。現經該會理事會商定，決請各會員個別與中信局洽商，而不由公會統籌辦理。該會某會員表示：此項決定，理由有二：（一）各廠所需之棉花品質不一致，不便統籌辦理；（二）理論上有問題。均以國棉之品質，答稱：陜棉之中，美種棉可紡卅二支紗，本種棉可紡廿支以上之紗；華中之美種棉，可紡卅支左右之紗，本種棉可紡廿支以下之紗。本市現所需要者，爲卅支以上之細紗；祖紗僅能織成粗布，銷於鄉間。</p>
<h3>大批洋紙到埠</h3>
<p>天祥洋行經理之海歲特號，前日由挪威來滬，裝來木造紙二千五百件，捲筒報紙以及各種洋紙一萬二千二百七十件，現泊公和祥碼頭起卸。又招商局執信輪昨日由津到滬，運來精鹽三千五百包，係久大精鹽公司報運。</p>
<h3>華股疲莫能興　成交數量銳減　便交盛傳下週可望實行　人心激動臨收買氣稍盛</h3>
<p>華股昨日上場微穩，業外游資似有參加，但以納胃有限，是以開後由平小漲，不久復告稱疲，十時後交易減少，市況寥落可憂，於是　面幫有畫形勢不利，一七六號出永紗進信和，市況更感怯疲，二三三號了結永紗，爲數較鉅，被迫下跌至七三〇元內，十一時半形同拉鋸，究以買胃有限，臨收均以低價結束，較前收熱股永紗信和景福勤興微挫，美亞新光跌落百分之三四，冷股大通微升，統益新亞內衣平平，餘者微挫，午後平穩少變，起仆有限，仍業徘徊，臨收時場外盛傳下週一可望實行便交，買氣稍盛，但以時間不及，收市價與最後成交價稍有參差，結果較前收計熱股永紗信和美亞景福新光勤興均稍下跌，冷股中紡華豐火柴公司微降，大通中絲榮豐微升，新亞統益水泥麗安平平，景綸五和各跌半成光景，總成交額爲六八二萬股，場外各股升降俱微。</p>
<p>外股形勢穩定，徘徊而已，形勢仍感不能持久，結果較前收計業廣微升，怡紗英聯會德豐紙業鋼業亞洲稍降，怡啤平平。</p>
<h3>四聊議決　工礦貸款辦法　機器原料准予抵押　房地產等不動產皆除外</h3>
<p>〔南京廿四日下午四時電〕四聊滬處辦理工礦貸款，原以協助流通資金爲原則，規定以原料成品爲抵押，惟近來迭接工商團體請求，將押品範圍放寬，增加房地產機器等作押，經該處詳加研究以後，如原料成品不敷抵押品，以機器作爲不足部分之押品，惟房地產與其他不動產，不得作押，工礦貸款辦法茲錄如後：</p>
<p>一·工礦貸款，以原料·物料·成品·半成品爲押品，其折扣視市場情形及其押品性質，由總分處隨時核定之。</p>
<p>二·如前條所有押品不敷抵供時，得以已開工，或有開工計劃，適合製造標準，由本總處核定認可之機器，作爲部份之押品，其成份至多以五成爲限，至其折扣規定如下：</p>
<p>A新購之機器，其年齡在三年以內者，照目前新價五成作押。</p>
<p>B原有之機器其工作年齡在十年以內者，照估價四折作押。</p>
<p>C原有之機器，其工作年齡在廿年以上者，照估價三折作押。</p>
<p>三·房地產及其他不動產，一律不得作押。</p>
<h3>貨價高利息重　煤市交易稀</h3>
<p>煤市白煤交易清稀，同業進胃，因貨價過昂，並利息亦大，故均以實銷量爲限，而賣主方面，仍以貨稀居奇，是以行市呈盤旋局面，無多大變動，烟煤塊前因缺貨市價較燃委會配價高出甚互，近來現貨已轉寬鬆，故廠方均直接向燃委會配購，煤商銷路漸見冷落，行市極爲疲軟。</p>
<h3>小麥禁運出口　市價昨已猛跌　米價亦節次回小</h3>
<p>米市到源絡　，客貨登記一萬餘石，消化仍呆，市況節節下游，南北粳中次續小千元餘，羊秈埠秈萬貨尚可，中下亦小千元，杜秈客秈再跌千元，白元步削二三千元，尚少交易，陰元再跌四五千元，油市消化尚可，生油依然俏俐，豆油菜油平平，蔴油無上落，黃豆汕頭停辦，積勞平疲，黃豆略加千元，芝麻挺秀，紅糧彷彿，茶豆沉悶，紅豆下跌千元，生仁高貨略有交易，外埠去胃揀高拾取，回升一二千元，花生銷路清淡，下挫二三千元，赤豆來貨多係零星，去胃亦懈，續跌三四千元，豆餅亦疲一二百元，麩皮堅硬，小麥禁運出口，消化不動，猛跌三四千元，尚乏正式交易。</p>
<h3>食油限價提高　菜油漲百分之八</h3>
<p>社會局邀集油糧業，油畊業等公會，民營油廠，中國植物油料廠，及中國食油公司各代表。召開審議會議，對食油價格，重新調整如次：青島　生油，九萬八千元，豆油九萬八千元，菜油九萬三千元，生蔴油九萬二千元，除生蔴油前次未列入限價內，此次首次添進以上三種限價，依照比例推算，以菜油漲價最多，佔百分之八，豆油佔百分之五，生油最少，僅百分之一二左右，昨日市場各貨，價格均未超出新限價，中植中食，仍繼續維持每日聯合配銷食油二百桶，計七百擔，民營廠如大德新，大有欲亦向市上拋售食油一千四百餘擔，據悉，如不受電力供應影響，民營各廠可月產兩萬擔，中植一萬擔，中食由青經常輸入一萬擔，配合本市需要，甚爲充沛，設受電力限制，產量可能降低一半，此次調整限價，各廠商對維持成本一項，不無禆益。</p>
<h3>武漢金融恐慌　行轅設法搶救</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口二十四日電〕此間金融市場不時發生變動，商號錢莊倒閉者，據報已達一百十七家，武漢行轅爲搶救日前危機，特於昨召集金融界及有關機關舉行座談，決定（甲）查核倒閉店號實況，如有詐騙情事，決予嚴辦，（乙）成立經濟研究小組，詳定維持金融辦法，（丙）切實支持合法登記之五十八家錢莊，同時取締地下錢莊，（丁）諮請財部考慮設立聯合匯備庫。</p>
<h3>生絲收購價格　雙方尚未妥洽　今日再開會決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕今日下午二時中信局中絲公司商品檢驗局中央銀行代表將舉行會議，續商收購生絲價格問題。昨日中絲公司與中信局曾約集絲廠代表及絲商多人舉行談話會，非正式交換意見，涉及絲商之痛苦及一般進出口問題。大致中信局之立場，爲站在財政觀點，認爲依照前次議決之價格，政府補貼已多，商人要求，實爲過份。中絲公司站在生產者之立場，認爲生絲之收購價格，應參照其他各國之情形及我國之生產成本而決定，使國庫不致負担過重，而絲商亦能欣欣向榮。</p>

<h3>蘇北局勢好轉　民間驚魂未定　啼痕處處</h3>
<p>— 十四日鎭江訊　本報特派員房滄浪</p>
<p>共軍雖山運河平原敗退蘇北沼澤地區的興化東台，希圖作最後掙扎，但在堅强的國軍包圍圈內，已不啻　中之　，今後的命運，不問可知。現在最値得我們注意的，是共軍留下來的一大串問題，其中罪重要的，是改革土地政策問題，再建基層行政機構問題，復興農村抓濟問題。蘇北人民目前正以一種若喜若驚如泣如悲的心情，睜大眼睛，看着政府去做，並且熱望政府趕快拿出一個賢明的辦法來，用血淋淋的事實證實中共的殘酷荒謬，反映國民政府所施的政策的確溫和，恰當，適合全中國人民需要。</p>
<p>五十歲小時脚婦人　遭殘匪殺害</p>
<p>邵伯，高郵，寳應，相繼爲國軍收復後，運河沿綫人民，已重見天日。惟以國軍進展迅速，各縣城區與鄉間之電訊交通，一時不易恢復，故運河東西兩岸點綫以外之廣火農村，仍有少數不及逃竄之殘匪，潛匿鄕間，伺機搗亂。在高郵，江都兩縣交界地區之淥洋湖一帶殘匪，曾於八九兩日，殺戮不甘投匪之良民洩憤，其殘殺良民之方法，較之日寇尤爲毒辣，時以鋤刀腰斬無辜人民。該地鄕民於本月九日，始獲悉國軍收復邵伯之喜訊，鄕民奔相走吿，時爲殘匪偵知，當夜被害者，達百餘人，雖年在五十以上之小脚婦人，亦不能倖免。聞當東竄能軍廻光返照時，樊川小紀鄉區人民，爲殘匪殺害者，爲數亦衆。</p>
<p>萬事莫如淸鄕急　善後工作忙</p>
<p>現在駐揚之國軍×××師，已乘勝推進。高寳整編第××××旅梁勃將軍，已親率所部進駐揚州擔負綏靖地方之重責，運河西岸之秩序，業已日見好轉。東岸殘匪，經我×××師黃部得力部隊搜索淸剿後，鄕區治安，亦可保無虞。</p>
<p>自本月九日起，至十五日止，應爲我運河沿綫逃亡在外之難民還城日。由本月十六日起，至本月底止，殆爲各縣難民之還鎭日。從下月起，各縣旅外難民，當可安然還鄕，復業歸耕。目前運河沿綫各縣之善後工作，萬事莫如淸鄉之緊急。</p>
<p>速硏計土地政策　求合理解決</p>
<p>當記者於本月十二日到達揚州，訪問蘇北各縣旅揚士紳及地方耆老，探詢對於蘇北收復區各縣之善後問題時，所獲之結論，第一爲迅速淸鄉，以安閭閻，其次爲重建基層行政機構，須愼重人選，刷新鄉政，與民更始，以杜悠悠者之口。再次爲愼重處理土地問題，速派資深望重學博織廣之大員，親至蘇北收復區研討中共在蘇北所行土地分配政策失敗之　因，並實地調齊蘇北土地之而積與種類，農田水利之現况，地主及其土地收益租佃之習慣，自耕農與佃農之生活，以爲將來秩序大定，國家統一，憲法實施時改芏土地政策之張本。</p>
<p>中共所行的政策　違國父遺敎</p>
<p>大部份蘇北人士，（包括地主及無土地者，）　於京滬報紙所載主張在蘇北收復區試行溫和土地政策，表示疑慮，一部份有經騐之人士，且斥爲此係某些四肢不動，五榖不辨，閉門造車的策士侈談土地問題之謬見。渠等且謂主張保留或竄易中共在蘇北所遺留之土地政策，實有背國父遺敎，因爲國父主張平均地權，節制資本的辦法，在「三民主義」中說得明明白白，絕不是中共生吞活剝的冷酷土地政業，和某些人主張似是實非的溫和土地政策所能代替。但此外，有一部份地方行政當局，亦僉認此爲一値得硏究之大事，應該愼重考慮，而在大亂乍平，飽經兵賽，過去地主與佃農均在共黨高壓政策下逃死不遑的蘇北，是否可以率先施行溫和的土地分配政策，則希望有經騐的專家們，先到淮北及運河各縣農村，去切實考察，仔細研究，拿出一個合理的解決辦法來。</p>
<h3>大成殿上公審周佛海　「兩面人」舊賬首次淸算</h3>
<p>— 廿一日兩京快訊　楊雁冰</p>
<p>經不起砲火考驗　自己扯破假面具</p>
<p>周逆佛海，是「汪記」叛國原始五人團之一，曾歷任僞中政會秘書長，僞國府委員，僞行政院副院長，僞財政部長，僞上海市市長，僞中央儲備銀行總裁，他的地位，在偽府雖僅次於陳逆公博，但他自成一系，儼若一個小霸，所作所爲，禍亂國家，罪惡昭彰，因此今天大成殿上公審周逆，可謂首都審奸最高潮的一幕。周佛海是湖南人，早年在日本東京帝大讀過書，和陰險狡滑的日本政客交過朋友。回國以後，在嶺南大學做過敎授，北伐時代，也會經一度出任過總司令行營的秘書。後來，又當過中央軍校武漢分校的秘書長，和政治部主任，不久便和汪精衛這傢伙勾結上，幹着贊國求榮的勾當。</p>
<p>當他做江蘇省敎育廳長的時候，抗戰的烈火正瀰漫於北方和江南的原野。那時候，周佛海也曾經嘶啞着嗓子，假正經喊「抗戰」，可是，經不起砲火的考騐，他的失敗主義的細菌便像瘧疾菌一樣在他的身上發作起來，他開始不安於國，跟汪逆私奔到河內，而且竟作了在逆投降的應聲虫。後來，他們索性扯破了假面具，做起通敵賣國的勾當，這種無恥的行爲，也就決定了他的終身。</p>
<p>淸晨七時不到，高院的門首即爲旁聽之市民擠得水洩不通。首都警察廳之交通車，於六時許，赴老虎橋，這時周逆佛海正在起床，見提票到，即忙穿上前晚其妻送去之新做灰布夾袍，並將單鞋式皮鞋擦亮，對法警曰：「對不起，請稍等片刻，待我進點早餐。」言畢，即取出奶油麵包兩只，食之，旋復將兩本十行字裝訂的自白晝放在黃色皮包內，戴上了灰色呢帽，經過的十分鐘之久。周逆佛海隨法警走出時，同監之丁逆默邨，羅逆君强，先後謂：「咱們先看老周的」，所方法警將周逆交由院方法警後，即登車押送高院，攝影記者乃大拍鏡頭。在車上，周逆問祝警長曰：「我的衣服恐怕穿得太多，在那邊可以脫麽？」警長答：「可以的。」旋又間周逆曰：「你伙食怎樣辦的？」周笑曰：「都是我家裏送來的。」言下頗表滿足之感。當車經過莫愁路時，祝警長謂已到莫愁路，周逆竟問：「現在還呌莫愁路麽？」再經過新街口交通銀行時，交通銀行即昔日偽中央儲備銀行行址，周逆對此屋長視達一分鐘，似有無限感慨。</p>
<p>國立河南大學：（上）校門（下）　（特派員邵愼之攝寄）</p>
<p>搬出共軍所藏糧　救濟了難民</p>
<p>蘇北局勢好轉以後，在經濟上對於京滬及鎭江，均有極大的裨益。運河打通不久，高郵寳應各地的食糧已經可以輸運一部至江南來，調劑民食。大軍北上之後，國軍的軍精亦可能在江北就地補給，因此高郵的米價，已由每石一萬元增至二萬，蘇北運河及裏下河，今年秋收尙好，雖然因爲農民不堪共軍壓榨，相率逃亡，人力不裕，但鄕間民食，據聞尙不十分缺乏，共軍在各地潛藏之公糧淸出後，以之救濟難民，實一舉兩便。不過，人民在共黨高壓欺騙搜刮之政策下，苟延殘喘，物質精神，均感無限痛苦，由揚州溯運河北上，沿岸居民，無間城鄕，不分老幼，大多面有菜色，憔悴不堪。據一高郵鄕間之老人吿記者云：幸而國軍於本月八日收復高郵，如再遲三日，全縣有鬚老人，均將不保，因共黨在高寳兩縣鬥爭之對象，已剩一「鬍子」。本月初後，高郵共黨政工人員，即喊出肅淸　子口號，向鬍子鬥爭。老人語此時，聲腔顫慄不已。</p>
<p>女在獨木舟上之影　（特派員江暮雲寄自日月潭）</p>
<h3>周逆看上不看下　大石級上摔了一交</h3>
<p>八時三十分，抵達高院時，高院已人山人海，周逆最後第二個下車，市民爭相觀看，周逆在衆目昭彰之下，似有愧色。十時敲過，審判長趙琛率領陪審檢察官升堂，周逆由四名法警押着，步出候審室，周逆高視闊步，似有持而無恐。可是在這時，也許是他看上不看下，竟在石級摔了一交。。周逆走進法庭，一步跨上那隻受審人的本架上，大概水銀燈和千萬旁聽者，多少奪了他的魂罷，他肥硬的兩頰和　子不住的抽動，身子也微微顫抖。</p>
<p>攝影記者們開始忙碌，鎂光照亮，機聲軋軋，在行動爲難的人海里，他們困難地跑動着。「爭取最好的鏡頭」，這是他們的責任。在鎂光耀眼地照射下，周逆低下了高傲的頭，險上開始泛上陣陣血色。台上，檢察官莊嚴地陳述着起訴要旨，嘈雜的人聲掩沒了這美麗而威嚴的字句。周逆伸長着頭，不住地搔着自己新剃的頭。</p>
<p>「七七事變以後，政府屢次宣示全面抗戰決心，不至最後勝利，決不中止。你是常年的宣傳部長，一定是知道的。」審判長威嚴地訊問着。周逆奸笑了，念頭一轉，他製造了一套新奇辯詞，說什麽法律上雖然應負漢奸責任，但政治上，因爲當時政治和國際情勢的惡劣，他却「自成一家」地另外有個新的看法。</p>
<h3>周逆供認　法律縱不制裁　良心亦感不安</h3>
<p>周逆畢竟聰明，說到這裏，看看庭上顏色不對，他知道剛才的宣傳沒有收到預期的效果，於是眉頭一皺，急忙轉頭，帶上一　裝作的懊悔語調，他連忙說：「一切是由於當時的判斷不淸，一到南京，我便知道完全是作錯了。」他說：「偸偸地離開重慶，法律上縱不制裁，良心上却至感不安。相反地，在南京的五年裏，即使法律加以制裁，良心上却絲毫不感愧怍，顯然地，周逆是一個事實（如他口中所說的政勢情勢）和法律的二元論者，在他看來，時運一來，法律大可以拋之九霄雲外。</p>
<h3>一個怪集團　低調俱樂部</h3>
<p>接着，周逆爲記者們解釋了一個多年冥思不解的專有名詞——低調俱樂部。他說：這在抗戰前僅僅是一個無正式組織的私人友誼集團。當時，凡是在他家裏進出的人，如像梅思平·高宗武……之流，對於對日戰爭，都感覺到非敗不可，因此，他們對於當時力主抗戰的人，都斥爲談高調者。有一天胡適博士到他家裏，談笑間，偶然提出這個怪雅的名稱之後，這個名字便傳誦海內，其實僅是一句笑話而已。</p>
<p>周逆永遠是一個兩面人。他說：他抗戰初期擔任宣傳部長時，內心裏主張和平，一直沒敢表示。但當庭上問他是不是表面上主張抗戰，骨子衰主張和平時，却露出一副尷尬面孔。他沒有任何的答覆。談到我們神聖的靑天白日旗幟，也委屈地給他們拖上了一個可恥的尾巴時，周逆笑了一笑，連稱「慚愧，不要提罷！」這時法庭的秩序，壞到不可收拾。蜂湧的人擠上法庭，爬上桌面，法庭裏只聽見各式各樣喊叫聲，凳子條桌一個個地踏成粉碎，站立在上面的人羣，一批批跌到地上。周逆掉頭回顧，笑了一笑，記者們被擠得沒有辦法，用背頂着擠來的人羣，繼續在紀錄着法庭的一切。</p>
<p>想不到周逆也會駡起汪逆的獨裁來，據他說：僞組織裏大事的決定權，差不多完全操在汪逆一人手裏。他們只能在小節目上，稍加修飾。例如說「和運」的決定，差不多全由汪逆一人包辦，提到「和運」當時的決定，周逆笑着加者一句：「陳　君要比汪逆更堅決些。」</p>
<p>記者愛看趙院長那一副持正不阿的莊嚴面孔。他聲色俱厲地朗誦着蔣主席當時駁斥近衛宣言的文吿：「抗戰信心絲毫不能動搖，否則即爲民族國家永遠罪人。」在詞嚴義正的宣示下，周逆又支吾了。</p>
<p>庭上更取出了周逆罪行的紀錄，什麼「日本有誠意哪」，「抗戰會抗到亡國哪，」「過去在中央任職時，是如何的痛苦哪」：一切一切，都載在周逆著的「和平反共建國」和「回憶與前瞻」兩本小册子裏。在這册子中，周逆還附帶批評孫科院長當日國際觀點的錯誤，但今天事實的發廣；　　　　，周逆祗得苦笑着說：「現在我才直正地錯了。』此外，在這本小册裏，他更認爲「和運」是由他開風氣之先的。</p>
<p>談到周逆的大量發行僞鈔與收購法幣資敵時，審判長感嘆地叙述後方的民衆如何在敵人疲乏的轟炸下，死亡，掙扎，工作，奮鬥的動人故事。末了，他責備周逆不該還用種種方法擾亂後方金融，這下子，可惹動了周逆的脾氣。他大聲地說：庭上不該「隨便」或「想當然」地推測當時情景，但常他一念及「隨便」兩字會引致法庭不愉快的情緒時，他趕忙笑着改口說：「啊，不是隨便」。</p>
<p>接着，周逆以「激昂」的聲調，發表謬諭，說他穩定了淪陷區的金融，又說他不是「通謀敵國，反抗太國，」而是「通謀敵國，救濟本國。」</p>
<p>他又說：「儲備銀行之準備金，共有黃金五萬二百卅一條，美鈔五百卅萬美元，白銀七百六十萬九千餘兩，銀元卅三萬元，儲票九二三萬元，日本公債二十萬元，上海原據貼現五千二百餘萬元，尙有其他股票動產與不動產等，此項準備金，已全數交給中中銀行，儲備行之發行額共四萬一千億元。」</p>
<h3>證人提證件　歷述策反及營救工作</h3>
<p>最後，律師王嘉祥提出關於與周逆有利證件十六件，隨即傳訊證人。周述帶着一絲微笑，感謝地替他們搬弄好證人台前播音器　第一個證人是在軍統局任職的周鎬，他與周逆發生關係是在卅三年一月，奉中央命來東南區擔任策反工作，到達南京後，即因另一工作人員陳克祥之介紹，與周接觸，因當時身入陷區，生命不可測，自與周相識之下，一見如故，因周之力，得打入僞府任職。又因周之介紹，與僞開對綏靖主任孫良誠聯絡，於卅三年策動孫軍由開封移駐蘇北，其次是吳化文，（僞第三方面軍總司令）策反，吳軍移駐蚌埠一帶，再次張嵐峯，（僞第四方面軍總司令）任援道，（僞第一方面軍總司令）經過策反工作後，均聽命中央，以上措施，均本人奉命辦理策反工作，事先與周商洽妥善，由周以軍委會副委畏地位，避免敵人疑心，下指揮移動，謀響應中央反攻，準備掩護盟軍登陸，防止土匪擾亂之佈置，周協助甚力。庭上問周鎬以上俱是事實嗎？你負責嗎？「願負絕對責任。」他堅決地回答。</p>
<p>第二個證人張叔平，他供由唐蟒之介紹，認識周佛海，深談之下，知周已悔司前非，後地下工作同志劉　夏被捕，亦經周設法營救川險。劉是第三戰區顧祝同之親信，當時由周委劉爲稅警團參謀長，因此周與顧長官，亦有聯絡策反關係，可請顧長官證明。第三傳梅思一，對周亦提有利證件數件，幷說於卅四年三月間，奉蘇浙皖邊區司令命令，曾赴滬與周逆治商策反工作應如何進行，週逆態度頗爲誠懇，在庭諭還押改期再審時，週逆爭謂「被吿起訴書中之共同通謀敵國圖謀反抗本國一點，不甘服罪。被吿於卅三年後，應爲通謀本國冀圖反抗敵國」。這話値得注意，也是使高院長硏究的地方，我們等待着續審的結果吧。</p>

<h3>磺胺類藥物　外用的優點和缺點</h3>
<p>— 張明</p>
<p>磺胺類（Sulfonamibes）藥物外用於細菌傳染性創傷和種種化膿性皮膚病，確有種種優點，比較普通的防腐藥要好得多。第一，磺胺類的刺性激很輕，不很妨碍收口的速度。第二，普通防腐劑的防腐作用很短，而磺胺類的防腐作用很長，一次用藥後，其作用可維持一二日之久。第三，磺胺類外用時，因濃度較高，對於各種化膿性細菌都有抑制的效力，不像數種防腐劑的作用僅偏於幾種細菌。</p>
<p>由於上述的種種優點，磺胺類的藥劑便迅速的代替了普通的防腐藥、普遍的局部應用於種種化膿性皮膚病和眼耳喉鼻等部的傳染。有的是藥水，用來滴在眼內或鼻內；有的是粉劑，用來撒在創內或潰瘍面；有的是錠劑，用來含在嘴內；更有種種藥膏；在市面上有數不淸的脾子。在上海，還有廠家將磺胺噻唑（即消治龍）製成牙膏香皂等化妝品，大量推銷，用以預防牙齦和皮膚的傳染，更將磺胺類藥品推廣爲日常用品。</p>
<p>但是磺胺類藥品的外用，並不是沒有危險的，作爲牙膏香皂大規模的濫用，其危險允大。據各國學者的報吿，磺胺外用，容易引起過敏性（Senstization），病人一且得了過敏性，便有種種的危險。（一）皮膚上也許發生種種皮疹，厲害的也能致人於死。例如許華茲（Schwartz）於一九四四年報吿：病人某常用含有磺胺類的滴鼻藥水，不知不覺中便得了過敏性。後來得了肺炎，醫生不知道已得過敏性，便給他磺胺類。這就闖大禍了：病人渾身就發一種極厲害的皮炎，身上皮膚一大張一大張的脫下來，再加以小便不通，很快的就送了命。（二）外用磺胺類時也有少量吸收到身體裏面，這種微量吸收最易　生過敏性。當時或並無任何表現，但一且因發生嚴重的傳染如肺炎腦膜炎之類，而採用磺胺類治療時，潛伏的過敏性便大大作　。而發生種種厲害的反應，有的直接致人於死（如上述一例），有的使病人不能繼續用藥，而死於不治的肺炎或腦膜炎等厲害的傳染病（例子更多舉不勝舉）。（三）最後却也是最厲害的危險，便是產生抵抗磺胺性的病菌。多數病菌經不足抗菌的微量的磺胺類長時間作用後，便產生一種抗藥性（Drug-fastness）而能抵抗磺胺類的抗菌作用，以後就是大劑量的亦奈何他不得，這種細菌在體內一得機會，便猖獗得無法用磺胺來制伏他，不僅對於病人在身有害，若傳染給別人，更是社會的大害。</p>
<p>據Abramowitz氏（一九四四年）的估計，這種過敏性常常發生。同年Tate與Klorfain在英國陸軍醫院中的統計，外用磺胺類藥品（主要是氨苯磺胺）而結果發生過敏性反應的的有百分之三。在磺胺類藥品中。磺胺噻唑（即消治龍）尤其容易引起過敏性反應。據Darke氏的報吿，應用磺胺噻唑膏的病人中，發生過敏性反應者有百分之六之多。</p>
<p>局部應用磺胺　唑藥膏，就是極小的分量也能引起過敏性反應。Beche氏於本年一月報吿一個病人，因爲鼻上生了一個小癤，他就給抹了一些磺胺　唑藥膏，四天後癤就好了。過了十天，手臂上又發現一個小　，他又照樣抹了一些藥膏，那知二十四小時後塗藥的地方發出許多痕疹，並且蔓延到沒有抹藥的地方，經過好幾個星期才把他治好。</p>
<p>外用磺胺類的種種危險，不僅大多數病人不知道，就是醫生們自己也多不知道。Blaisdell氏知道一位醫生，常爲病人上磺胺噻唑藥骨，每次手上不免沾到一些，他就雙手一搓，將沾到的藥膏搓去。結果發了一身的皮疹。</p>
<p>因此美國醫學會的藥物化學委員會子去年入月發表了一篇報吿，詳細說明磺胺類外用的危險，引起醫界的注意。他們大聲疾呼，反對磺胺類藥物的濫用於皮膚或粘膜，並且主張藥房出售磺胺類藥品必須要根據醫生處方，不能聽憑病人購藥自療。同時也勸吿醫生勿得隨意採用磺胺類外用藥劑，如有嚴重之傳染血不得不冒險一用時，亦不得運用至五日以上。至於磺胺牙膏磺胺香皂之日常應用者，當然應該在禁用之列。在美國方面，現在已有數州用法律禁止磺胺類外用藥劑之不經醫生處方面公開發售，希望吾國衛生當局亦採取適當處置，以增進公衆的安全。</p>
<h3>消化性海嘯音</h3>
<p>— 夏鎭夷</p>
<p>治療時的心理因素</p>
<p>吾人深信情緒作用對於消化性潰痬，患者病狀的持久與復原的阻害有莫大的關係，尤其在這生活高度緊張的現社會，我們對於他們的心理因素，更切實的注意！</p>
<p>一向覺得心理輔助治療最大的困難，就是精神健康不能在短期內所能奏效，而且以爲各患者有不同的心理問題，需就個別設想，分析與訓練，因此有些學者曾對許多富裕的患者用個別接近法作過很精密的心理硏究，假使各患者各有不同的心理問題，那末用儸別接近法定會收很大的效果，可是結果那些患者沒有得到些微心理上的改善。雖然，我們沒有實騐上的證據，我們可相信各患者的主要心理因素，其共同性比個別的特殊性要多。我們可看到各患者都有相同的症狀：如消化不良，極度饑餓感覺易恐懼忿怒，便秘與痛覺易感性的增强。至於心理方面，亦有許多共同點：（一）患者常感精神煩懣。慵困。善怒並凝思無限的困難。（二）他們常以不健康作爲與親朋談話的中心，（三）他們常想用意志來克服他們的境况。</p>
<p>當情緖緊張的時候，胃腸運動增速，痙攣，弛緩及血運减退，這些對於胃腸的健康有相當關係，因消化性潰瘍的治愈，是由於患部起纖維組織化，這變化完全是新陳代謝作用，在適當的環境中，患部會自愈，這適當的條件，就是患部的休息與血運的充分。我們知道身體的休息與情緒的緊張是相忌的，腦子極度的刺激與興奮時，身體絕對不能休息，因腦子常在不愉快情緒的狀態中，會刺激傳出神經，故假使他們能避免或减少情緒過度的話，，疾患就不難自愈了。</p>
<p>我們不能忘記精神與身體關係的密切，醫治一個內科疾病，我們不能忽略了心理的因素，尤其是對於治療消化性潰瘍一症，除了藥物及食餌療法以外，我們更須注意心理治療，下面便是施行心理治療所根據的幾點共同原則：</p>
<p>（一）憂慮的抑制：消除憂慮與煩悶的方法很多，最簡單直接的方法便是，使患者學習些愉快的活動或消遣來代替煩悶的思想，以後合宜的指導患者回憶過去生活中最愉快的事蹟，每當他們煩悶不快的時候，就盡量的去追憶那些過去甜蜜快樂的情境，大部分的患者，兒時的回憶是有很大的帮助，這樣使煩悶的心境消逝，內心常充滿喜悅愉快的源泉。患者起初要變換他的思想是很覺不便，不過經數天的練習就能應付裕如了。</p>
<p>（二）討論的抑制：要抑制患者常以困難作爲與親朋談論的中心，並非難事，因他若知道這是對他病狀復原有影響的話，他很能自制，不過最緊要的是，要得他們家屬與朋友的合作，親朋最好能避免談及困難的事，每當患者發怒的時候，爲母親或妻子的當提醒暗示或規勸他，這樣便可减少情緖的緊張。</p>
<p>（三）奮力的抑制：患者常想用奮力或意志來克服特殊的情况，可是常因得不到解決而煩躁，這是一件很大的缺點，因爲奮力與內臟的休息是背馳的，故盡量的减少或避免奮力，常指導他們不要自思苦惱，過用情緒，患者有許多特殊的境遇須加注意的，下面便是一個很普通的例子：</p>
<p>譬如患者養成了一個習慣——當他臨睡時，桌上總要放蓿一杯牛乳，以作夜間被痛覺擾醒時的解痛劑，他雖然覺得這是一不良的習慣，應當改除牠，不過他心裏仍有些要這杯牛乳的傾向，這兩個觀念在他腦中爭鬥，他覺得自己太無用了，太軟弱了，連這一點小事都沒有決斷的毅力，於是他慫恿自已，抑制自己，這自斷的傾向就是用意志或奮力來解決疑難的表現，故每當他稍有牛乳的傾向，就須照着做，不管他實際上是否需要，其實這習慣沒有多大意義與重要性，所須注意者乃當臨睡時，不要將恐懼晚間胃痛與沒有牛乳的事存在心裏，那樣食物，他不敢吃最好能避免或不吃當他心想吃某樣食物時，他可稍微吃一點，這樣恐懼心因之减少，對於自己胃力的自信也就增强了。</p>
<p>（四）解釋談話：每日對病者作四十五分鐘的心理談話，闡述思想的性質，對於身體活動與日常生活的影響，觀念的來源與情緒反應的關係，並常稱贊藥物與食餌治療法的價値與功效，從這些談話與解釋中，能使病者明瞭自已，改善自己與保持健康。</p>
<p>（五）自我暗示：我們知道病者的心理影響於健康至大，可是他們都常感消極，悲觀，這種灰色的人生觀應該打破，並須建立一樂觀的積極的人生觀，故病者須時時自信他的病狀已漸復原了，每當晚上臨睡或淸晨未起的時候，回復的默念似Coue氏所建議的詞句：「一日復一日，我的健康跟着進展。」（Day　by　day，every　day，I　am　getting　better　&amp;　better），我們深信病者的自信力與思想改變的訓練是促進復原的二大要素。</p>
<p>（六）誘導暗示：用誘導的方法使病者產生一種自信力，Bernbelu氏稱爲誘導暗示，這種自信力包括消化·吸收·睡眠·活動，消除情緒的緊張與疼痛，便秘的改正等。</p>
<p>照M．N．Chappell：J．J．Stefons諸氏，試騐的結果，稱共同心理訓練不但可使症狀改善，並且至少可助病者在三年內享受健康生活。因此我在這裏特爲提出介紹，我希望內科醫生們在治療這些病者時，不要忽略他們心理的因素。</p>

<h3>人與病菌之戰（七）</h3>
<p>— 喬樹民</p>
<p>摘自「傳染病管理」</p>
<p>過去吾人對放傳染病的管理，大多爲一篇失敗史。蓋往昔關於傳染病的眞實性質，未盡明瞭，有所措施，不免落於空洞而不切實。今本刋已於第十三期說明傳染病三個要素，自宜運用吾人所已知之科學方法，針對此三個要素，而謀撲滅抑制之。大抵截斷傳染的三個要素中之一個，便足收防制之效。就人力之經濟立塲言，則應因地制宜，因時制宜，從最易而最有效之處著手。固知吾人現有知識，仍甚欠缺，後之視今，亦猶今之視昔。然在現階段中，亦僅能做到這樣地步，使我國能切實施行，由於傳染病之寃死寃病，可望减免過半也。</p>
<p>一　病源之遏止</p>
<p>抑制病源，爲傳染病管理之「釜底抽薪」的要圖。病源之抑制方法，大別有六：</p>
<p>（一）報吿——所謂「報吿」，乃指遇有某種傳染病例發現，立即報吿當地衛生機關之意。</p>
<p>A何時報吿——報吿貴乎及早；亦貴乎完備。</p>
<p>B何人報吿——歐美等國，關於傳染病的報吿，槪由醫院及開業醫師負責。我國醫院及醫師數目過少，亟需其他機關及人員參加協助。</p>
<p>C報吿何病——目前僅規定十種傳染病爲法定傳染病；必須報告，（1）天花（2）猩紅熱（3）白喉（4）流行性腦膜炎（5）鼠疫（6）霍亂（7）傷寒及副傷寒（8）桿菌赤痢（9）斑疹傷賽10圍歸熱</p>
<p>D報吿何物——報吿之內容，應力求簡要，始不致使塡報者厭煩而放棄，尤以我國之塡報者未必全爲技術人員爲然。</p>
<p>（二）調査——調査工作應於收悉報吿後立即開始。</p>
<p>A調査目的——在調査開始之前，最好先使調査者洞悉調査目的，成績可較美滿。</p>
<p>B調査人員——尋常均以</p>
<p>（1）公共衛生護士——爲主要調査者，但</p>
<p>（2）醫師</p>
<p>（3）衛生稽査，工程師</p>
<p>（4）其他人員——有時亦屬需要。</p>
<p>C調査內容——調査內容，自隨傳染病之種類而異。以第一次調査爲最需詳盡，不論疾病之性質如何，大抵調査目的，均側重於傳染來源之發掘，故下列七項，多不可少：</p>
<p>1患者全家（或同住者）之姓名</p>
<p>2患者全家（或同住者）之性別</p>
<p>3患者全家（或同住者）之年齡</p>
<p>4患者全家（或同住者）之職業</p>
<p>5患者全家（或同住者）之過去病史</p>
<p>6患者之日常飲食來源</p>
<p>7患者之可能的感染機會</p>
<p>（三）隔離——所謂「隔離」，係將傳染病患者分居於指定塲所，使其所帶病原體，不復有侵擾他人的機會，此實爲傳染病管理之要着。如能將第一例患者予以嚴密的隔離處置，疾病可望不致蔓延。隔離對於天花，霍亂，鼠疫，斑疹傷寒等迅劇之傳染病的防制。尤其價値。但對於難以早期診斷而有早期傳染性之傳染病，如麻疹，百日咳之類，則隔離不易收效矣。施行隔離，有家庭隔離與病院隔離之別，試分述之：</p>
<p>A家庭隔離——應注意下列各點</p>
<p>（1）家庭隔離，宜有兩間房屋，專供隔離患者之用，最好住於樓上。</p>
<p>（2）凡患者所不需用之衣物傢俱器皿等類，均應於事先移出。</p>
<p>（3）房門應關閉，或懸以紗簾。</p>
<p>（4）窗應洞開，以求空氣流通，並應裝紗，以防蠅蚊之出入。如室內己有蚊蠅虱等，應即撲滅之。</p>
<p>（5）除醫治護侍人員外，他人一槪不可人內。醫治護侍者，均須嚴密注意消毒洗手更衣（隔離衣）等事項。</p>
<p>（6）患者所用之衣物器皿，在消毒前，一槪不可携出室外。</p>
<p>（7）患者之排泄涕吐等穢物應予消毒，或焚化掩埋，</p>
<p>（8）家屬賓客人等，均不得謁晤患者，必要時，僅得隔簾小語。</p>
<p>（9）患者痊愈，並不再帶菌時，應沐浴更衣，然後外出。</p>
<p>除少數富有家庭，可望做到此種家庭隔離外，多數家庭，實難辦到，惟此種隔離，縱不完密，亦聊勝於無。如事實許可，自以送入病院隔離爲是，不僅隔離完密，且可獲得正當之療洽焉。</p>
<p>B病院隔離</p>
<p>（1）傳染病院或隔離醫院——是專爲隔離幷療治傳染病患者的醫院，每一城市均應成立之</p>
<p>1院址之選擇——以地址高爽，便於排水，不住於擁鬧之區（周圍半哩內居民不宜超過六百人），而交通仍無不便者爲尙。</p>
<p>2床位之配備——大抵每一千人口，應設有病床一張，但每院最少不宜少於十二張病床。床位較多，較爲經濟合算。每張床位，宜佔有一四四平方呎之地面，及每小時六〇〇〇立方呎之新鮮空氣。</p>
<p>3床邊之隔離——</p>
<p>（1）護侍治療人員，均需著隔離衣，凡與患者有任何直接或間接接觸，應隨即消毒洗手。</p>
<p>（2）每一患者所用過之衣物器皿，均需嚴密消毒，並限於該患者一人使用。</p>
<p>（3）患者之各項排泄涕吐等物，均需嚴密消毒，或焚化掩埋。</p>
<p>（4）床與床間之距離，宜在一〇呎以上，以防泡沫傳染。</p>
<p>4人數之配備——人數視規模之大小而定。</p>
<p>B隔離病院之代替者——在某種環境下，固定性的隔離病院或不能成立，或某種傳染病不必送院隔離時，宜設法有所代替之，通常有下列數者，可資應用：</p>
<p>1廟宇祠堂之借用</p>
<p>2民房之暫時租用</p>
<p>3病家屋宇之利用</p>

<h3>儀態萬方</h3>
<p>— 孫福熙</p>
<p>表情學硏究自序</p>
<p>人面不同，各如其心，因神爲心苜，有其心，始有其神。故面貌情態，雖一言一動之微，亦均從心出。而矯正言動，亦可矯正心之邪僻。</p>
<p>常見時裝美女，一望使人敬慕者，倘有一笑一語，即流露其深淺。</p>
<p>吾國素重禮儀，或莊嚴或伶俐，各有其長，近來風氣不良，敎育欠佳，以致社會所見，大抵言動鄙俗，神態倉皇，旣不能保持中國固有的莊嚴，亦不及歐美的活潑。試留意年來的公衆會集，或則沉悶疲倦，或則浮滑淺薄，均感民族衰弱的悲哀，今特提出這問題，作初步的硏究。</p>
<p>表情學是綜合生理心理文學與美學的精拌，對於文學描寫，圖畫表現，戲劇演出，都有絕大貢獻，而於日常生活，亦須臾不可離也。歐洲靑年‘常有專家指導，對鏡作表情之練習，使待人接物處處中節，不致有失態之嫌。吾國少人注意，故無良師善本可求，欲加硏究，須時刻留意，戲院，飯館，電車中，馬路上，觀察周圍言動，幷追究自己言動的原因與結果。例如在一個集會，觀察來客，有的沉默冷靜，有的跳躍言笑，再分析自己拘束無聊時的緣故，與自己談笑風生時對當時的環境的影響。我們可以發見許多似哭非哭，似笑非笑，與哭笑不當的表情。</p>
<p>所以，欲求進步，第一是智識的問題，我們必須學習，方知是非標準。第二，更爲重要的是思想的問題，存心正直，對於人類有深厚的敬愛，方不致有輕蔑與鄙夷表情的流露。第三，在中國民族有一個更重大的問題，就是體力的問題，中國人許多不遵道德不守法律的原因，是體質太弱，『非不進也，體不勝焉。』在公衆會塲上打呵欠，伸懶腰，立了想坐，坐了想睡，結果是不到終塲而先退。從以上三點，再綜合美育的準繩，庶幾言笑有節，儀態萬方了。</p>
<p>這不但於國家民族增加許多體面，而且，在個人，亦自高身分，减少誤會，於事業上有極大的帮助。</p>
<h3>美在哪裏</h3>
<p>— 叔孫如瑩</p>
<p>談到藝術，便會談起美。美是藝術的本質，審美的行爲便是藝術行爲。健康的人生是美的楷模，藝術品是美的結晶。然而，美，這飄渺而玄幻的事物，它究竟存在哪裏？</p>
<p>當我們在欣賞風景的時候，我們讚頌道；「這眞美！」當我們在欣賞一幅畫的時候，我們讚頌道：「這眞美！」當我們視到一個凱旋歸來的戰士與他的倚閭期待的老母相見而抱頭痛哭的時侯，我們心裏也暗暗地讚頌着：「這眞美！」我們隨處會發現美的踪跡，但我們却始終無法捉牢美的本質。-</p>
<p>美，竟在哪裏？存於物呢，還是存於心？</p>
<p>如果你說，美存於于物，存在於自然風景中，存在於藝術品中，存在於人類慷慨悲壯的行爲中，可是，我得問你，在一個忙碌終年的農夫心目中，爲什麽始終沒有發現到他村前的山川之美？在一個以買賣舊字畫爲生的古董商心目中，藝術品爲什麼只是與財貨毫無兩樣？在一羣正冒着槍林彈雨向敵人衝殺的健兒心目中，爲什麼興奮與緊張的情緒淹沒了一切的感覺，根本談不到美與不美？</p>
<p>就以一幅名畫而論。這畫在收藏家的手裏視爲珍物，而在一個衣不蔽體，飢不得食的貧困者看來，這幅誠不若一塊麵包之有價値。即使這畫落入一個組織之無的團團富家翁手中，他也許會因這畫中的淡墨叢竹不若福祿壽三星圖之吉利而表示遺憾，不特此也，當波馬舍的喜劇「斐加諾的結婚」出版時，法國批評家咸斥爲下流庸俗，但終於在若干次演出後獲得了一致的好評。一個好的藝術品甚至連批評家們都看不出美來。那麽，說美存於物，或者毋寗說，美是存於欣賞者的心中更爲確當了。</p>
<p>要說美存於心吧，却也有所大謬不解之處。一幅壞的畫決不會因爲欣賞它的是一個詩人而變得更美些，一張白的紙在畫家的眼裏也僅僅是一張白的紙，決不能使他有美的感覺。對於一個懂得欣賞的人，他對於美的標準提得更高，一般藝術品殊不願入目，一般人認爲美的事物，在他往往更覺奇醜無匹。美之所以爲美，決不是欣賞單方面的幻覺，因此，我們也不能相信這美存於心的說法。</p>
<p>美旣不存於物，復不存於心，那麽，美究竟在那裏？</p>
<p>當我們的心與外物相接觸的時候，我們便有所知覺。觀察的是心，被觀察的是物，評價的是心，被評價的是物，常這種觀察或評價的行爲發生時，美，或者不美，便出現了。</p>
<p>由此可知，美不是心的尺度，也不是物的屬性，而只是心與物的一種調和的統一。當心物交接時，美才有出現的可能，也就是，美，只存在於心物交接的時候。正如「世有伯樂，而後有千里馬」一樣，縱然有千里馬，如無伯樂，千里馬亦不能以千里稱，縱然是藝術品，如無欣賞者，藝術品之美亦徒然埋沒，亦無法謂爲存在。</p>
<p>尤有進者：心與物交接時，即使已進入審美的境界，但美的價値判斷，亦往往因人而異。以讀詩爲例，有人喜歡陶淵明，有人酷嗜李義山，並以爲其所愛者爲美，其所不愛者爲不美。這裏所謂美，乃是主觀的美。主觀的美，只要心與物交接，審美行爲發生時便可能出現，因此，香烟廣吿畫在小學生心中也是美，八仙過海岡在三家村的塾師心中也是美，但這美不一定合於客觀的標準，並不是研究美學者的主要對象。</p>
<p>客觀的美的標準的尋求，才是治美學者的主要任務之一，但這標準殊難有所斷論，而且，這裏所謂客觀美，也不過只是相對的客觀美而已。客觀美的存在，亦必須在心物交接之時，但更需附加若干條件，且需爲主客觀統一狀態，客觀美才能被人認識。</p>

<p>『低眉信手續續彈，說盡心中無限事。』這是潯陽江頭商婦的哀音。可是在這哀音中，祗充滿着敵愁別恨，若論她那遲暮之感，沉淪之苦，比之瘦西湖上的彈琴老嫗，似乎又有霄壤之別了。</p>
<p>這瘦西湖上的彈琴老嫗，經常彈唱的地點是綠楊村。許多老年的茶客都說，她在妙齡之時原來也是一位名妓。爲什麼沒趁着時光還不奪去她的姿色時，尋個歸宿，便是『老大嫁作商人婦』也不可能，老者們就又慨嘆着說：『那時的她，眞個太紅了，總以爲花可長好，月可長圓哩！』</p>
<p>她在一綠楊村賣唱的時期是很長的。最初的她，像還是老去徐娘。古典的服飾，配合着殘存的風韵，很可令人懷想到過去絲楊城郭的繁華。因此，每天總還有不少的茶客花錢要她彈唱。她彈着月琴，唱着過時的歌曲，猶之十夜的鵑啼，深秋的蟬響，眞够得聽衆們迴腸盪氣。可是時光又逼着效，將殘存的風韵消逝了以後，要她彈唱的茶客，便也隨着减少了。於是她祗有在許多茶客面前自動的彈唱起來。彈唱了一會以後，便又自動的向茶客們討索幾文。討索不是易事，她不知受到人家幾多白眼，也不知向人陪了幾多笑臉。再後來茶客們對她的態度，似乎隨着她的老醜更是變得惡劣，於是她在彈唱時，縮到一旁，幾乎速臉也不敢向着茶客了，祗想利用自己摧抑的歌聲，引起別人一些悲憫的心情。</p>
<p>不過她雖是被許多茶客們所遺棄，可是其中一些年老的人對於她，像還留存着未經毀盡的舊情。這就是常有的事。到了夕陽越過了西邊的山頭，暮色蒼茫，漸次籠眾了大地，她收拾了月琴，帶着疲倦和失望的情態，將要離開綠楊村的時候，會遇到一些老年的茶客，問問她賣唱的情形，更搖頭代她惋嘆，幷且還會招呼茶房備一些點心送給她去吃。『這眞謝謝×老爺了！』她說着，同時更向老者飄來媚眼。老者也撚鬚微笑。這時彈琴老嫗和那老者，都像回復到少年時代，又溫理着靑春之夢了。可惜這綺夢終是要醒的！，今日的瘦西湖上，彈琴老嫗和那些年老茶客，再也不見其蹤影，該已拋撇湖山，長眠地下了！</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　72</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我們辦公室中，這時差不多每人都在幹着一點消磨時間的事。有的抽着烟捲，吐出一個一個的圓圈；有時寫着日記之類的東西；有時在報紙上顚去倒來，找點什麽看看；有的把眼睛釘在天花板上，好像上面正映着電影；有的匆匆離座，跑川屋子，也許是上厠所，又匆匆趕了回來。等等，等等。然而每隔一兩分鐘，必有人要看看牆上的掛鐘，對對自己的手表或掛表；還有十五分，十四分，十三分，十二分，……</p>
<p>但是牆上的掛鐘，走到五點明明還差七八分鐘的當口，猛不防地，忽然聽得驚天動地的一聲巨響，就在我們屋子的近邊爆發，連玻璃窗格，都震得「砰」的一下；大家不的而同的「咦」了一聲。這是我們約定舉事的信號。爲什麽早了七八分鐘？到現在也許還未找到原因；據主管這事的人，事後說他確是準時發令，他在一小時之前離開本部，臨走還對準了時刻哩。　來人家追問他的時候，彼此一對各人的時計，却又一分不差。這件事眞有些莫明其妙。</p>
<p>信砲一響，隊長看了掛鐘，又瞧了自己的手表，縐了縐眉頭，立即把手一揮，我和虎弟立刻從樓中躍起，出了辦公室，帶了外面候着的六個快報員，分乘兩部汽車出發。僞公府離開我們這裏，最多五六分鐘的遠近。我們還　一間路的時候，已經聽見槍聲四起，僞公府已經起火。這時天色並未大亮，雖然朦朧，一切事物，尙可依稀看出，不過有的地方和東西却反被火光逼得有些昏朦。距離僞公府還有三四百碼的地方，路上已經混亂起來，大街小巷，塞滿了各種人，東西奔闖，有的軍裝，有的平民，有的是保安隊。</p>
<p>亂雖是亂，可是戒嚴的情勢已經成立，各要路口，都有保安隊小組，担任佈防，儿無本部所頒發特別臂章的，一律不許通過，這些擁塞在街頭巷尾的人，本來對於這次舉動，有些莫明其妙，但幾分鐘之間，我們潛伏在各區的宣傳小組，已用最迅速的散佈方式，把我們印就的「吿市民書」撒了出來，大家這才知道是這麼一回事，於是邀照宣吿書上的指導辦理，各人首先就整理出一面靑天白日的國旗，趕緊縣在自己門口。</p>
<p>我同虎弟看見車子一時難得走過去，便囑咐司機勤務，把車子停在路側守候，我們各人拿出器械，下車步行。到了僞公府，找到了指揮的負責人，知道事情極其順手，現在正在配置投順的警衛隊，淸點文件，等等；同時又分撥了人救火，佈防。當下我趕緊寫了報吿，同虎弟兩人簽了名，撥了兩名快報員同部報吿。</p>
<p>「報吿！」虎弟這時，突地對我一立正，行了一個軍禮；這是他任職以來，第一次弄這玩意，倒是弄得滿像那麽一回事；火概背地裏很經過一番排練哩。可是我一時沒防到，倒吃了一嚇。「報吿隊長，——我要趕到那邊去捉賊了。」「那邊」指着股逆等住宅。</p>
<p>我想提拿殷逆，也是風急火灼的事，確得上緊去帮忙，便答應他快去，又囑附他不能貪功胃上，因爲抄査逆宅，逮捕　逆，木有專責的人，我們不過是從旁補一點力量而已。又關照他，最要緊是在六點鐘正，回到總部，我們會齊了，好到城外去。又再三囑咐他不可斷了聯絡。</p>

<h3>蟻與蚜虫</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>事受權利，就必得盡義務。</p>
<p>且看生物中的蟻。</p>
<p>蟻能和其牠小生物共棲的，如甲蟲及其牠昆蟲，蜘蛛，陸樓甲殼類等，而最普通的是和蚜蟲共樓。牠們的共棲生活情態如何呢？據生物學家考察的結果：</p>
<p>蟻用牠頭上的兩條觸角，磨擦蚜虫的背，使蚜虫分泌糖分，便乘機舐食之。但蟻能驅除蚜虫的害敵，保護蚜虫，有時且取蚜虫的卵，搬入自己棄裏，過了冬天，等到春暖的時候，再將已孵化的幼蚜虫，搬到植物的嫩芽上，如遇險惡的氣候，則又將幼蚜虫搬入巢內，使其暫避。</p>
<p>蟻爲了舐食蚱虫背上的一點糖分，（還是用自己的觸角磨擦出來的）你看牠何等忙碌，負責任，盡義務。</p>
<p>殺雞喫蛋，更談不到飼養了，今日，社會上就多的是這種殘忍而又愚蠢的人。</p>
<p>社會問題資料</p>
<h3>離婚的調解</h3>
<p>— 柴扉</p>
<p>婚姻糾紛的調解機構，在我國尙不多見。這種糾紛的調解其實不應該完全訴諸法庭。它是屬於社會服務的範疇的，社會部所設各地社會服務處應該當仁不讓，担負起婚姻調解的任務來。像陳季政控吿薩木駒史璧人通奸，妨害家庭案，（所謂「抗戰夫人」案）終於免不了訴諸法律。其實，在健全的社會，本案的初步應由社會服務機構來調解。</p>
<p>在美國，婚姻調解是有專門機構的，甚至有人以爲側人終身職志者。婚姻調解工作做得最好的，據一般公認，以密瓦基地方的家庭糾紛調解部爲最著。牛　德夫人係該部主持人，她調解離婚使不睦夫婦言歸於好，其成績超過任何一個從事此道的美國人。</p>
<p>她說：「有許多離婚的原因係基於疾病，因此使他們不能正常從事職業活動，而每個案件都需要個別處理的。」可見她並不重視婚姻糾紛的表面原因。她的工作可以說並不只造福於密瓦基一個地方。據社會學家警吿我們：戰時離婚案件風起雲湧，幾達到每五對美國夫婦中必有一對鬧離婚的程度，而密瓦基力挽狂瀾，成效甚著。於是美國，加拿大，南非，菲列賓，澳洲各都市的法官及社會服務所，便要求牛卜德夫人供給他們參考資料，帮助他們組織同樣的婚姻調解機構。</p>
<p>夫妻何事反目　破鏡可以重圓</p>
<p>在牛卜德夫人接任以前，密瓦基地方調解婚姻糾紛每十五案中只有一案是成功的。如今幾乎一半以上將近破裂的家庭，一經調解即破鏡重圓。據密瓦基民政科官員說：「我們給牛卜德夫人領導的調解部每年三萬七千美元的經費，實在是市政府的最佳投資。」</p>
<p>夫人怎樣着手她的凋解工作呢？例如有一對史高伯夫婦到調解部，夫人便問：</p>
<p>「爲什麼要離婚呢？」</p>
<p>「他是酒鬼，常常對準我的鼻子威嚇我，打我。」太太這樣的控訴道。</p>
<p>「她常常對我唾馬，要離開我！」先生藝辯着：「敎堂的牧師敎我們來看你。」</p>
<p>夫人點點頭，毫不驚奇。因爲一萬個離婚案中，交夫人及其十二個助手來處置的，總有三分之一由牧師，親友，甚至是法官提交來部的。另有三分之一由密瓦基家庭法庭提交來部的。其餘則由離婚夫婦自動來部請求調解的。</p>
<p>夫人以同情的語調詢問，探知史高伯夫婦離婚的根本原因，係由於丈夫在工廠服務，不很得志，於是以飲酒忘憂，常與太太吵嘴。太太忍了一個月，終於忍不住氣要離婚。</p>
<p>應用心理測驗硏究離婚原因</p>
<p>「我想，」夫人沉靜地說：「史先生的職務是便你倆要離婚的主要原因。」史氏天婦均疑惑望望她。她便請一位義務性質的心理學家來測騐史先生的工作能力。</p>
<p>心理學家測騐結果認爲史某生未宜於做機匠工作；而他平時暇時他　以　　　汽車消悶。如今他成爲　　間的頭目，酒也幾乎戒了和太太相處甚睦。</p>
<p>夫人有時也從離婚夫婦子女的供詞發覺其癥結所在。一個高中學生　　陳　令人痛心的家庭狀况：一爸爸像舊鞋子一樣老實，但是媽媽常過他上俱樂部，上時髦的交際塲所，和那些在她認爲正當的人士廝混。爸爸却情願躲在地下室裏玩他所嗜愛的木馬。他們想他們還是離婚好，因爲有人追求媽媽。但爸爸媽媽實在是相愛的。」</p>
<p>於是夫人對離婚夫婦提出這樣的意見：「光生應該陪太太每個星期上交際塲所一次；太太反過來應該鼓勵先生玩木馬，但不應該老是釘着先生常和所謂正當人士厮混。」結果也很有成效。</p>
<p>後來，兩個女孩子吿訴夫人說，她們的爸爸處理家事聽信祖母的話，因此常和媽媽口角。夫人便勸這個男子去見一位精神病專家。他知道家庭生活不悅原因以後，開始想到自己年已四十，什麽事應該自作主張。於是從此不提離婚兩個字。</p>
<p>太太不生兒子　影響夫妻感情</p>
<p>夫人認爲追究離婚的原因，最先應該考察的是夫或妻的健康情形。曾有一個患偏頭痛的少婦向夫人哭訴，她不能再和她的丈夫同居。夫人請精神病專家勸她，生活要處之舒泰，睡眠充足，少參加舞會和俱樂部活動。六星期以後，她的病况減輕，自知夫婦衝突，她也要負責任。</p>
<p>一對夫婦因太太不生育，而時常吵嘴，隣人去求救於夫人，結果亦由精神病專家指明他倆應　　　　　，從此吵嘴便停止了。</p>
<p>濟困難　　　　　　人　勸他們　　　　　　假如目前家庭經濟周轉不靈，離婚以後組纔第二個家庭時未能够改善，而且離婚的損失，每次至少在五百美元以上。</p>
<p>夫人從事調解的最大困難，要算拜金的法官及律師對她的無情攻擊，誣她及其助手爲「密瓦基家庭私生活卑鄙的闖入者。」但實際上確如她自己所說，她是一個社會工作者。自從她丈夫在第一次世界大戰殉職，她即從事婚姻調解，迄今總有一萬對夫婦，經她斡旋而懸崖勒馬。她遭遇的困難不管如何頑强，但是她還是努力不懈。她說現在她要紛忙終日，開始她第二個一萬對的調解工作。</p>
<p>從天人的經騐，使我們感覺當今世界處理任何事都離不開科學，從事中國社會服務工作者，對此似應多加警惕。</p>

<p>賣票員：「喊了這半天，你爲什麽不買票子？」</p>
<p>乘客：「哼！你可以揩油，難道我就不能嗎？」</p>
<h3>所謂「抗戰夫人」</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>頗爲滬人重視的所謂「抗戰夫人」案，已由第一審判決薩本駒史璧人通奸（及相奸）各處徒刑四月，吿一段落。</p>
<p>原吿仍要上訴，究竟尙不可知，不過此項判決只是對於通奸行爲的本身，至於這一男二女如何處理其今後關係，是事實問題，或許將成爲實際上的一夫兩妻了。果爾，則他（她）們之中，恐怕煩惱多於幸福。我不敢侈談是非，只覺得像這類問題，究竟怎麽弄才好呢？</p>
<p>首先，我覺得所謂「抗戰夫人」云云，未免有些巧立名目。在法律上明明說他（她）們相姦，而實際上又譽之爲「抗戰夫人」，這不知道是那一位「抗戰丈夫」杜撰出來的。察其用意，大槪在减輕其法律上應負的責任。所以薩案的辯護律師索性在庭上作「風馬牛」的辯護。說是被吿奉×××之命，如何如何，有功抗戰，似可作爲審判之參考云云，眞是牽强之尤！</p>
<p>再者，被吿留在陷區的髮妻，一般都呼之爲「淪陷夫人」，不知怎麼想起來的？其實，淪陷兩字冠於夫人上面實在太不妥當，到底淪陷於誰手呢？勝利後該是「收復的」囉！如果說太太留在陷區並未陷於人手而苦等天明，然而一旦天明丈夫却帶回了一個戴着「抗戰」帽子的「夫人」，同時又把髮妻視爲淪陷過的「夫人」，眞是有傷忠厚，設不過去！</p>
<p>由於戰爭流動，而發生類似此等案件，原不必看作十分嚴重，但如果巧立名目視「有配偶人與人通奸」爲心照不宣的正當合法事情，則未免要影響到社會組成的應有秩序！在第一審里，薩史案是以「十二萬元罰金」即可了事的；這是否近乎情理，我們（法律的門外漢）不必妄加論斷，所必須提出的是：巧立名目之風不可開！我以爲：在許多所謂「抗戰夫人」案十中，有許多主角，（放縱的男子）即使不抗戰也要與人通奸的。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹風雲人物　土總統伊諾努</h3>
<p>— 彌山</p>
<p>舉世矚目的蘇土關係，因韃靼尼爾海峽的糾紛，更形惡化。土耳其對蘇聯的覆牃，業已公佈，堅拒共管韃峽。此後局勢的發展，關係整個歐洲的安危，各方面都予以極大重視。土耳其在戰時，陷於四面楚歌境地，仍然不甘屈服，堅守中立，終使希特勒歛戢了野心；戰後依舊在緊張的空氣中，周旋於列強之間，而始終應付自如，沒有吃過什麼虧。因此此人都欽佩土國的秉國鈞者，是一位多麽幹練又圓滑的人物。</p>
<p>土國領袖，伊諾努，是土前總統凱末爾的繼承者，土耳其開國兩大元勳之一。他的原名叫做伊斯美·巴夏（Ismet　Pasha），現在的名字乃是代表一次輝煌的戰績。在一九二一年到一九二二年的土希戰爭中，他曾領導土軍在伊諾努地方獲得了空前的勝利，爲了紀念他的戰功，遂把這地名爲其姓氏。</p>
<p>伊諾努生於一八八四年，一九〇六年畢業於軍校，不到二十歲，已是推翻土耳其的秘密黨首領了·一九一六年的俄土戰爭，在軍中與凱末爾相識，從此結下了永久的友誼，他當時作了凱末爾的參謀長，土希戰爭中在伊諾努地方的戰功，奠定了他未來事業的基礎·土希戰爭勝利後，被派往瑞土任和議代表，於是他由軍人一變而爲政治家和外交家。</p>
<p>一九二三年起，連任內閣總理六年。一九三八年凱末爾逝世，國會通過推舉他繼任總統，一九四三年再度　選，本年八月中土國普選，伊諾努以「渡溪不宜換馬」的競選口號，獲得佔全數八分之七的票數，當選連任。</p>
<p>伊諾努的性格和凱末爾完全相反，大家知道凱氏是熱情勇敢而好出風頭的人，他的完成革命，推進革新運動，猶如一陣風暴。而伊氏喜歡冷靜，他有「不求人知，聽而不言」的能力，忍耐和客氣是他成功的秘訣，他對付敵人，會一味紙老虎到底，雖與强國鬥爭時，他在表面上仍然和藹有禮，但是他始終堅持着自己的主張，、不肯有所變更。</p>
<p>伊諾努的私生活很少人知道。在公共的集會塲所，不易找到他的蹤跡，偶而出現時，他總是穿着整齊的英國式禮服。他有一個很快樂的家庭，有子女三人。平時喜歡騎騎馬，酒在平時是涓滴不飲的，即使在交際塲中，也難得喝一盃葡萄酒。</p>
<p>土耳其沒有强大的武力爲後盾，而在地理上橫跨歐亞，尤其那扼黑海通地中海的孔道的韃峽，更是列强必爭之地。執政者稍一不愼，便有受到戰禍的危險。伊諾努的外交政策，向來是利用歐洲列強間的衝突，使土耳其「漁翁得利」。他竭力聯絡美英，力謀繼續維持韃靼尼爾海峽由土耳其單獨設防。由於他應付的周到，手腕的圓滑，使弱小的土耳其漸漸爭得了國際上的重視。凱末爾在生前也常常稱贊着：「伊諾努是土耳其最圓滑的人物！」</p>

<h3>National Army in Pingbao to Join Forces Soon Fierce Fighting Near Xushui Hebei Provincial Government to Rebuild Pingbao Highway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th Dispatch] The statement that the National Army in the northern and southern sections of the Pinghan Railway had joined forces in Xushui yesterday is not accurate. According to news from the Commander's Office, the National Army deployment in the north is still near Beihe Shop to Gucheng. The National Army advancing north from Baoding in the south has crossed the Cao River and is approaching Xushui. The Communist army has gathered two main armies in Xushui and is engaged in fierce fighting. The Communist army south of Baoding is still conscripting laborers and actively destroying the railway. The Communist army south of Shijiazhuang is currently preparing to withdraw, and the Hebei-Shanxi-Henan Border Region Government of Handan has moved to northern Henan. The Handan Municipal Government has moved to Xiahucun, Handan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 24th Dispatch] The Baoding National Army is advancing north extremely smoothly. The military commander personally commanded the front line, and the Pingbao army will join forces soon. Our newspaper reporter inspected with the army. In addition, the National Army is carrying out mine-sweeping operations along the way in Gaobeidian. According to sources, the Hebei National Army will increase by two armies to engage in defense and road protection work.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 24th Dispatch] The Baoding garrison is extending to the north and south. The northerly troops captured Caohe on the 23rd and are rushing to repair the Xushui railway bridge, which will soon join forces with the southerly National Army. The southerly troops counterattacked Fangshun Bridge and have engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th Dispatch] The Hebei Provincial Government believes that the destruction of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway this time is extremely serious, and there is a lack of all equipment and materials. Even if the railway is opened, it will be difficult to repair and open to traffic in the short term, so it is divided into construction and should make plans in advance. Once the passage between Pingbao is opened, it will mobilize civilian workers to rebuild the Pingbao Highway, which has been destroyed for a long time, and use cars to maintain Pingbao traffic. In addition, the order in Baoding and Shijiazhuang has become stable, but there is a great need for chips for military supplies and construction projects. Yesterday, the Hebei Provincial Government dispatched a special plane to transport banknotes to Baoding and Shijiazhuang to transfuse blood to the besieged isolated cities.</p>
<h3>Pingsui Railway Completely Opened Twelve War Zone Headquarters to Move to Zhangjiakou National Army Enters Chicheng from Rehe into Chahar</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th Dispatch] The entire line of the Pingsui Railway was completely opened by yesterday morning. After recovering Tianzhen in northern Shanxi, the Chahar Western National Army recovered Yanggao on the morning of the 23rd and joined forces with the Ma Zhanshan cavalry advancing east, which recovered Julebao on the 22nd. At this point, the entire line of the Pingsui Railway was declared open. According to the Pingjin Railway Bureau, the Gui Sui to Datong section will begin active repairs immediately. The Zhangjiakou to Xuanhua section has been repaired and opened to traffic, but there are few cars and the distance is short, so the headquarters of the Twelfth War Zone has temporarily used cars to make transportation connections between Zhangjiakou and Kangzhuang from the 20th, departing two cars daily. It will take one day to reach, and the fare is 18,000 yuan. Kangzhuang to Beiping has been opened to traffic, and about one-third of the entire line is still waiting to be repaired. The Commander of the Twelfth War Zone will move to Zhangjiakou because Commander Fu is in charge of Chahar.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 23rd Dispatch] The National Army entering Chahar from Rehe entered Chicheng on the 23rd after recovering Duolun and Guyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th Dispatch] It is reported that prices in Zhangjiakou are much lower than in Beiping because the legal tender has not yet flowed in in large quantities. Speculators here are trying to find ways to go to Zhangjiakou to take advantage of the opportunity. Small traders are already coming and going on the Pingsui Road. However, gold does not seem to be active in Zhangjiakou. Merchants in Chahar Province, who have been subject to control for a long time, have not yet figured out how to seize this turning point to make a fortune or lose money. To meet market needs, 150 kinds of circulation notes issued by the Chamber of Commerce have been circulated in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua. The notes are printed in red letters in lithography and are of poor quality. The front of the notes says "Exchange for legal tender on the same day," and the back states "Will be recalled when legal tender is sufficient." However, this item is not welcomed by many collectors or citizens.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 24th Dispatch] Xiangshui was captured by the Communist army on the 22nd. At this point, all the outposts of Yulin were lost, and the situation suddenly became urgent.

<h3>The Four Joint Offices Have Redefined New Methods for Industrial and Mining Loans Machines Can Be Used as Partial Collateral However, Real Estate and Other Immovable Property Cannot Be Used as Collateral</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] When the Shanghai Municipal Council Petition Delegation came to Nanjing, it requested the authorities to relax the scope of collateral for industrial and commercial loans and to allow real estate, machinery, etc. to be added as collateral. After detailed research by the Four Joint Offices, it has now been decided that if the raw materials and finished products for industrial and mining loans are insufficient to provide as collateral, machinery recognized by the office can be used as partial collateral, but real estate and other immovable property cannot be used as collateral. The new methods for providing collateral for industrial and mining loans as approved by the office are copied below: (1) Industrial and mining loans shall use raw materials, material finished products, and semi-finished products as collateral. The discount rate shall be determined by the Four Joint Offices from time to time based on market conditions and the nature of the collateral. (2) If the collateral listed in the preceding paragraph is insufficient to provide as collateral, machinery that has been put into operation or has a definite plan for operation, meets manufacturing standards, and has been approved and recognized by the Four Joint Offices can be used as part of the collateral, with a maximum component of 50%. The discount rate is as follows: 1. Newly purchased machinery with a working age of no more than three years shall be pledged at 50% of the purchase price; 2. Existing machinery with a working age of no more than ten years shall be pledged at 40% of the estimated value; 3. Existing machinery with a working age of more than twenty years shall be pledged at 30% of the assessed value. (3) Real estate and other immovable property shall not be used as collateral.</p>

<h3>Measures Agreed Upon by the Provisional Headquarters to Save the Hankou Commerce and Industry</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 24th] The economic market in Hankou has always been outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Recently, with the rise of speculative capital, legitimate merchants have been subject to exploitation by usurious loans, resulting in a series of debt disputes. Large households possessing speculative capital are mostly reluctant to lend, resulting in extraordinarily tight credit in the last half month. Various businesses that rely on borrowing for operations are closing down due to losses. According to reliable investigation, as of today, a total of 117 businesses in the city have closed down. The ratio between the total value of inventory and the total amount of loss is approximately one to ten. Among them, there are also not a few business owners who have fled to escape punishment. In order to save this crisis, the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters specially convened relevant agencies and organizations yesterday to hold a symposium on maintaining the financial market, at which the following was agreed: (1) The Provisional Headquarters will telegraph the central government to promptly establish a reserve treasury for the silver and money industries; (2) Public pawnshops will be opened promptly; (3) The Four Banks and Two Bureaus will be requested to increase the amount of industrial and commercial loans in the city.</p>
<p>Tonight at 7:30 p.m., Director Huo Sai-shu of the Executive Headquarters for Disaster Relief will broadcast on the Shanghai Radio Station regarding the issue of disaster relief (photograph by Gan Le-li of the Executive Headquarters).</p>
<h3>Annual Meeting of the Academia Sinica Council Concluded Successfully Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Doctoral Degrees to be Examined Independently by Respective Colleges and Universities</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Third Annual Meeting of the Second Session of the Academia Sinica Council continued its group discussions at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th, reviewing the work reports of various institutes, reviewing the principles of doctoral degree examinations and the granting of various issues, discussing the division of authority between the Academia Sinica and the Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education, and other issues.</p>
<p>At 3:00 p.m., a plenary session was held. The first item discussed was the review report of the first group. Regarding the review of the work reports of various units, the discussion resulted in the deletion of Articles 7, 8, 9, and 3 of the review report, with Article 6 slightly revised. Article 5 was revised to state that the work of the Astronomical Institute in concurrently serving as the government observatory and providing time signals is attracting the attention of people across the country and the world. The Academy should petition the government to allocate significant funds to solve the current difficulties of the Astronomical Institute and strengthen its research equipment and talent training. The remaining articles were passed in accordance with the original review opinions. The revised proposal to change the Astronomical Institute to a meteorological station was then discussed, requesting the government to allocate significant funds to solve the difficulties and strengthen equipment and talent training.</p>
<p>The review report of the second group was discussed. Regarding the issue of doctoral degrees, it was resolved that "the Council believes that the doctoral candidate's usual research work and doctoral dissertation should be reviewed and examined independently by universities and independent colleges that have been approved by the government to establish a research institute for more than five years and have been specially permitted to accept doctoral degree candidates. Those who pass the review and examination shall be granted a doctoral degree by the college or university after being approved by the Ministry of Education."</p>
<p>Then, it was discussed to request the government to instruct the Academy to be responsible for preparing the 2,500th anniversary of Confucius' birth, i.e., 1950, and to request the government to instruct the representatives of our country attending the General Assembly of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in November of this year to formally propose inviting the General Assembly to hold a meeting in China in 1950. Fu Sinian opposed this proposal. Fu stated: "The year and month of Confucius' birth are actually unresolved historical questions. It is problematic for us to suddenly determine that 1950 is the 2,500th anniversary of his birth. I truly admire Confucius' greatness, but there are also aspects of his doctrines that I do not fully agree with." Hu Shi expressed his opinions from the opposite standpoint. It was resolved that: (1) The case of commemorating the 2,500th anniversary of Confucius' birth shall be handed over to the next council for discussion; (2) The Ministry of Education will be requested to instruct the representatives of the Chinese delegation attending the General Assembly of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to formally invite the General Assembly to be held in China in 1950 at the first General Assembly in November of this year.</p>
<p>The review report of the third group, regarding the determination of the powers of the Council and the Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education, was resolved to be passed in accordance with the review opinions. Regarding the International Council of Scientific Unions, increasing the number of members of its Committee on Science and its Relation to Social Relations by twelve, a proposal to submit candidates was decided to nominate Zhu Kezhen, Weng Wenhao, and Lan Bendong as candidates. The case of inviting our country to send representatives to participate in the 75th anniversary commemorative meeting of the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers was resolved to send Councilor Wang Chongyou to participate. All cases were discussed by 6:50 p.m. After Zhu Yitiao delivered a speech, the conference concluded successfully at 7:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Important Resolutions</p>
<p>The important resolutions are attached as follows: (1) Regarding the proposal to cooperate with various universities, it was resolved to allow full-time researchers to teach a course related to their research field at the university, with no more than four hours of teaching per week. When necessary, the university may request full-time researchers from the Academy to teach a course in their specialty for one semester or one academic year. (2) Regarding the Ministry of Education's letter requesting the establishment of a Legal Research Institute in advance, it was resolved to postpone the establishment due to financial difficulties. (3) Regarding the case of granting doctoral degrees, after seeking the opinions of several institutes, it was resolved that the Council believes that the doctoral candidate's usual research work and doctoral dissertation should be approved by the government, established a research institute for more than five years, and universities or independent colleges that have been specially permitted to accept doctoral candidates shall conduct their own review and examination. Those who pass the review and examination shall be granted a doctoral degree by the college or university after being approved by the Ministry of Education. (4) Regarding the case of the 2,500th anniversary of Confucius in 1950, it was resolved that the Council intends to request the government to instruct the Academy to be responsible for preparing the 2,500th anniversary of Confucius. This case will be reserved for discussion at the next meeting, and the Ministry of Education will be requested to instruct the Chinese delegation attending the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Conference to formally invite the General Assembly to be held in China in 1950 at the first General Assembly in November of this year.

(6) Nominating candidates for the Committee on Science and its Relation to Social Relations of the International Council of Scientific Unions, it was decided to nominate Mr. Weng Wenhao, Mr. Sa Mudong, and Mr. Zhu Kezhen as candidates.</p>
<h3>After Thirteen Years of Accumulated Hatred, the Enemy is Captured Today: The Main Culprit of the Tragic Massacre in Pingdingshan Village, Fushun, Kubo, is Arrested; Over Three Thousand Villagers Were Killed at the Time</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] The elders of Northeast China have accumulated hatred in their hearts, and the tragic massacre in Pingdingshan Village, Fushun, which occurred in 1933 (Republic of China Year 22), is still infuriating. The main culprit, Kubo, etc., have been arrested by the Japanese Nationals Prisoner of War Administration here and will soon be transferred to the Northeast Provisional Headquarters War Crimes Tribunal for trial. The course of events in this case is as follows: A Japanese shop near Fushun was attacked by volunteer soldiers. Afterwards, part of the shop's goods was discovered in Pingdingshan Village.

<h3>Traitor Yin Rugeng's Trial Concluded Yesterday; The Prosecutor Enumerated Crimes and Requested the Death Penalty; The Life or Death of the Veteran Traitor to be Decided on the 31st</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] Veteran traitor Yin Rugeng underwent his fifth trial at the Capital High Court on the 24th. At 10:30 a.m., President Zhao Chen, along with Presiding Judge Ge Zhiqin, Jin Shiding, Prosecutor Wang Wenjun, and Clerk Hu Hanbin, entered the court. Yin Rugeng was wearing a gray silk robe and black cloth shoes. His face was fleshy and his hair was white, but he looked flustered. Especially when President Zhao pressed him closely with a solemn tone, revealing his fear of death, Yin Rugeng was stammering, making mistakes, and was at a loss, which was laughable and pitiable. After questioning his age and background, the court first stated that the favorable evidence he had submitted had been fully investigated, and then read out the handwritten reply from Vice Minister Qi Dechun stating that Yin Rugeng's organization of the pseudo-Jidong government had never obtained the tacit agreement of Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and that there was no contact afterwards; the reply from the Salt Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Finance also proved that Yin Rugeng seized the salt tax of 22 counties in Jidong in 1934 and coerced the Changlu Salt Administration Bureau to obtain a huge sum of four million yuan. Then, in turn, he was strictly interrogated for his crimes of organizing a pseudo-regime, issuing counterfeit currency, promoting enslavement education, assisting smuggling, using air force bases, private armed forces, and military yamen mineral deposits to plan to repair the Grand Canal and plot to respond to the "Greater East Asia Holy War". Yin Rugeng either evaded, denied, or quibbled. The debate began at 12:30 p.m. After enumerating his crimes, the prosecutor said: "Throughout the country, even a three-foot-tall child knows that Yin Rugeng is a veteran traitor and should be sentenced to death by the court." Upon hearing this, Yin Rugeng's expression changed drastically, his face turned pale, his whole body trembled, and he frequently wiped his eyes with his sleeves. He then defended himself in a trembling voice, claiming that he "sacrificed himself and jumped into the fire pit to preserve the vitality of the country and buy time", and that "after being arrested by the Japanese, he did not intend to take office again, but was forced to do so!" He also cunningly claimed that "if no one had been willing to sacrifice at that time and had broken with Japan abruptly, there would not be today's situation. He believed that the prosecutor's words were based on the current situation and discussing the facts of that year, and were mostly speculation." Then, lawyer Zhang Shizhao stood up to defend him. Mr. Zhang, with his qualifications as the former Hebei-Chahar Political Council, spoke from personal experience, saying that the government was pursuing a two-faced policy at the time, and Mr. Song Zheyuan endured humiliation and suffered terribly. Yin Rugeng's actions were also a result of the situation, and he hoped that the court could divide Yin Rugeng's behavior into two parts for trial based on the July 7th Resistance War. Lawyer Zhang Wenbo added further remarks. Around 2:00 p.m., the court ordered the debate to end, and the sentence was set for the 31st, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi Talks Freely About World Affairs; Expresses Optimism About the Overall Situation at Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] Hu Shi, who came to Nanjing to attend the Academia Sinica Council, received reporters on the 23rd and expressed optimism about the world and domestic situation, repeatedly saying, "I am not pessimistic at all!"</p>
<p>The International Situation Should Not Be Pessimistic</p>
<p>Mr. Hu believes that the world situation is "not bad," as this war was an unprecedented war in human history. It has only been a little over a year since the enemy surrendered, and it is impossible to restore everything to its original state in this short period of time. The situation should be the same abroad. For example, the United States still feels a lack of meat, and strikes are on the rise. When I (Hu speaking of himself) went to England last year to participate in the World Literary Conference, our delegation stayed in a hotel in London that had not seen an egg for three weeks; however, countries such as Britain and the United States have taken measures to a considerable extent, so the people are not suffering too much. For example, in the United States, rent has not increased by a single cent in four years. I was afraid that the new location of the US Embassy in the United States would be taken by someone due to the housing shortage, so I voluntarily increased the rent, but the US government would not allow the landlord to accept it. The postwar situation in various countries is good and bad, but I am not pessimistic about the world situation, and I think I shouldn't be pessimistic. Generally speaking, the current situation is better than after the end of the last great war. To this day, almost no country wants to go to war again. At the same time, a new international organization has emerged after the end of World War II. There is indeed constant discord between major countries, but this is a good phenomenon. Bernes, Bevin, and Molotov may not speak politely to each other, but no one wants to break up, and no one wants to demolish the stage. In the last international organization, neither the United States nor the Soviet Union participated, but now all major countries are participating, and countries that truly take aggression as their doctrine, such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, have no say, so I am not pessimistic about the international situation at all.</p>
<p>The Domestic Situation Has Improved</p>
<p>Speaking of the domestic situation, Mr. Hu first said: I came here because I was busy with the resumption of work at Peking University, and recently I have been busy with meetings, so I have no time to read the newspapers carefully, so I am not very clear, and he quoted the joke he told in Beiping: "I didn't even know who the chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government was." Then he asked the reporter: Who is the chairman of Jiangsu? After learning that it was Wang Maogong, Mr. Hu said: "Very unfamiliar." When asked about his views on national affairs, Mr. Hu said: The situation in our country has also improved compared to the past. When I was in Beiping, the Communist Party representatives there could move freely without interference. When I met Dong Biwu in Beijing, his movements were also not interfered with. This is a new atmosphere and a good phenomenon; in terms of speech, it is also more free than in the past, such as the publication of the Xinhua Daily in Chongqing, which is an example. Mr. Hu also solemnly pointed out: Freedom is a habit and must be gradually cultivated. Tolerance is also a habit and must be gradually cultivated. Now everyone says what they want to say, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>Optimistic About the Future of Academics</p>
<p>Mr. Hu is also optimistic about the future of academics in our country and reiterated his speech at the opening day of the Academia Sinica Council: If the government can provide ten years of stability, academics will definitely make great progress. The situation of university education is also the same. Peking University held examinations in nine places this year (three of which were joint admissions with Tsinghua, Nankai, and other universities). 32,500 people participated, and the results of this examination are sufficient to represent the level of secondary schools across the country. Generally speaking, the results are not only incomparable to those before the Anti-Japanese War, but also inferior compared to the period of the Anti-Japanese War or the period of occupation. The main reason is that students have been selected for broadcasting in the past year, and their lives are unstable, and their studies are bound to decline, which shows the importance of stability to academics; however, the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War have given students rich life experience, making them deeply aware of the difficulty of life and the difficulty of learning. This will also help them in their pursuit of knowledge, so although the current results are relatively poor, as far as I am concerned, I am not very pessimistic.</p>
<p>Will Continue to Engage in Writing in the Future</p>
<p>Mr. Hu also briefly discussed his plans for future writing, saying: Once the school starts and everything is on track, I can handle fewer administrative matters and engage in writing. When asked when the second volume of "History of Chinese Philosophy" could be completed, Mr. Hu first said that the materials had been collected, but it was difficult to determine when to continue writing; later he said that he would abandon the entire book and planned to rewrite it and rename it "History of Chinese Thought" and expressed that he was more interested in specialized research recently; as for the "History of Vernacular Literature", he also planned to rewrite it and rename it "History of Chinese Living Literature".</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked him about his thoughts on the departure of Jiang Tingfu, and Mr. Hu repeatedly said: "This is a most regrettable thing." Mr. Hu praised Mr. Jiang highly, but said that Mr. Jiang had said that he planned to take a short rest, and it would be difficult to return to school to teach in the next semester.</p>
<h3>It is Not Easy to Live in the Capital! Landlords Arbitrarily Exploit Regardless of Government Laws; Foreign Embassies Consider Moving to Shanghai or Plan to Reduce Staff</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] The lease terms of most houses in the capital have expired, and residents have received notices from landlords or agents increasing rents by several times. A Latin American diplomat rented an embassy residence a year ago for $300 per month, but now the landlord is asking to raise it to $1,000 per month. In addition, the rent for the residence of an employee of the Embassy of Afghanistan is also being asked to be raised from $250 to $3,000. Other members of the diplomatic corps are also encountering the same crisis. Although the authorities have promulgated rent control regulations, restricting the rent of new houses to no more than 20% of the cost and land price, and the rent of old houses to no more than 500 times that of October 1937 (Republic of China Year 26), Nanjing landlords ignore it and arbitrarily exploit it. Some members of the diplomatic corps have considered reducing staff or moving to Shanghai. An ambassador told a United Press reporter that he had recommended to his government to reduce the number of embassy personnel to a minimum and order the remaining personnel to return home. The Nanjing Municipal Government is at a loss as to how to implement the rent control regulations, and even the National Government cannot rationalize or legalize rents. For example, the Central Propaganda Department wanted to rent a hotel in accordance with the prescribed rent to entertain foreign reporters, but could not find one for months, and finally rented a house for 50 million yuan in legal tender per year. The municipal authorities plan to build small and large apartments to solve the housing shortage for civil servants. The National Assembly plans to requisition the dormitories of various universities to solve the accommodation problem for 2,050 representatives.</p>

<h3>Only Specialty in the Eastern Hemisphere: Asbestos Mines Discovered in Hualien Port, Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hualien Port, 24th] The asbestos mines in Hualien Port (located on the east coast of central Taiwan) are the only specialty in the Eastern Hemisphere. The richness of its reserves is comparable to that of Canada, a world-renowned producing area. There are two producing areas, Fengtian and Ruisui. During the war, the Japanese carried out mining in Fengtian due to military and industrial needs, extracting 500 tons per year. The current reserves can still be mined for 20 years, but it has been suspended. Ruisui has even richer reserves, but has not yet been mined. Preliminary surveys estimate that there are more than 200,000 tons, and the quality is better than Fengtian.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Looking at the World's Future from the Opening Speech</h3>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly opened the day before yesterday in New York, the "Capital of the World." Although the world dares not be overly optimistic about the prospects of this UN General Assembly, after hearing President Truman's welcoming speech, infinite hope arose, and the belief that the UN General Assembly would succeed was further strengthened. Summarizing President Truman's speech, there are six main points: First, the UN organization does not focus on solving current problems but on trying to maintain future international peace; second, the United States has an unshakable belief in maintaining peace and is willing to provide all its resources to support the UN organization, and will never return to its previous isolationist attitude; third, UN member states must not use force to interfere with the territorial integrity and sovereign independence of other countries; fourth, any country that launches aggression must be sanctioned by the International Court of Justice. Although this noble principle has been established, it has not completely eliminated the world's fear of future wars, so the United Nations must establish an agreement to take more active and concrete actions so that all countries, large and small, can share reasonable peace; fifth, all of America's goals are aimed at preventing war, seeking genuine peace, and promoting the realization of the Four Freedoms (i.e., the freedoms of speech, religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear advocated by the late President Roosevelt); sixth, the Allied countries should immediately negotiate an agreement to disarm Germany and Japan to ensure that fascism cannot raise its head and engage in aggression again. Therefore, the Allied countries should draft peace treaties with Germany and Japan as soon as possible, which is also urgently needed.</p>
<p>During the Paris Peace Conference, seeing the ups and downs in the Luxembourg Palace and the pessimistic expressions of representatives from various countries, people inevitably felt some emotion about the future of the post-war world. While they urgently sought peace in their hearts and hoped that the UN organization could become an effective tool for maintaining world peace, they did not dare to overestimate its value, and the shadow of the League of Nations often appeared before people's eyes, raising people's vigilance toward the UN organization. However, after hearing President Truman's words, this kind of doubt immediately dissipated, as if gaining a reliable guarantee that the UN organization would never repeat the mistakes of the League of Nations. Although the League of Nations was also a product of the Great War, its purpose was also to promote international cooperation to maintain world peace; however, its nature was completely different from that of the current UN organization. First, although the League of Nations was initiated by the late U.S. President Wilson, no U.S. representative attended the opening ceremony of the League of Nations. No one can deny that this was the League of Nations' fatal wound. Since the United States adopted isolationism, the League of Nations could not become an effective tool for maintaining world peace. Therefore, the failure of the League of Nations was by no means accidental. Second, the Soviet Union remained outside the League of Nations for the first ten years after its establishment. It was not until Japan violated the covenant that the Soviet Union raised the banner of peaceful diplomacy, and Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Litvinov stepped into this nominally "Palace of Peace" amidst the applause of representatives from various countries. However, in today's UN organization, not only are the United States and the Soviet Union both participating, but they have both become the two major pillars of the UN organization. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson welcomed representatives from various countries, saying, "The United States has integrated its consistent foreign policy into the UN organization." Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also said after arriving in New York: "The Soviet delegation is sure to make a contribution to this UN General Assembly, so that it can complete its work to promote the interests of peace and the welfare of the people of all countries in the world." Therefore, with the full support of the United States and the Soviet Union, the UN organization will surely complete its task of maintaining world peace, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Although President Truman's speech did not involve U.S.-Soviet relations, his call for all countries of the United Nations to work together to seek peace certainly included the Soviet Union. This newspaper's editorial on the 23rd pointed out that the focus of today's world political situation lies entirely on U.S.-Soviet relations, and the key to the success or failure of the UN General Assembly also lies entirely on U.S.-Soviet relations. British Prime Minister Attlee also gave a speech in the House of Commons the day before yesterday, emphasizing the necessity for the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to cooperate in order to avoid the catastrophe of a third world war. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes also recently stated that the American people have extended a hand of friendship to the Soviet Union. This makes us even more convinced that the only way to prevent a third world war is through close cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. Since President Truman said that all of America's goals are aimed at preventing a third world war, the United States will redouble its efforts to obtain the friendship of the Soviet Union. At the same time, we believe that although the United States and the Soviet Union are two completely different countries in terms of ideology and system, one being a capitalist democracy and the other being a socialist Soviet state, at present, whether for the sake of the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union themselves, or for the future of the entire world, they should work together to maintain world peace. War is not only the destruction of the world, but also a catastrophe for both the United States and the Soviet Union, which is harmful and useless to both sides. Therefore, the UN General Assembly is being held in New York in an atmosphere full of peace and light, and it is entirely possible for politicians from both the United States and the Soviet Union to act with great wisdom and benevolence, abandon prejudices, dispel suspicions, and reconcile. I remember that when Molotov arrived in New York, he said: "I believe that sincerity and goodwill will surely lead to mutual understanding, and any difficulties can be solved easily." We are looking forward to the United States and the Soviet Union being able to seek mutual understanding with sincerity and goodwill and sweep away the current international haze.</p>
<p>Recently, the political situation in the United States has also caused a great uproar due to the rift between Secretary of Commerce Wallace and Secretary of State Byrnes in foreign policy. Although the Secretary of Commerce has been succeeded by Harriman, a loyal follower of the late President Roosevelt, the outside world is still skeptical about whether President Truman will continue to adhere to Roosevelt's legacy. It could not be eliminated, but after listening to President Truman's words the day before yesterday, "America's goals are aimed at preventing war, maintaining true world peace, and promoting the realization of the Four Freedoms," we can rest assured completely, and can believe that the current U.S. foreign policy is following the path indicated by the late President Roosevelt and moving toward the goal of these Four Freedoms. All foreign accusations, either that the United States harbors imperialist ambitions or that the United States uses financial diplomacy to achieve certain goals, can be refuted without being attacked and really do not need to be refuted again.</p>
<p>Although the pace of the post-war world towards peace is very slow, and countless international conferences have been held in the past year and a half, the result is only the formulation of five draft peace treaties; however, this little achievement is enough to encourage the world. The future of peace is still bright and splendid, and the second step is to create peace with Germany and Japan. President Truman also bluntly pointed out that the two countries should establish an agreement immediately. Therefore, we hope that when the four foreign ministers hold a meeting in New York on November 4 to discuss the German issue, everyone can seek mutual understanding with sincerity and goodwill, reduce differences of opinion to the minimum, and then establish a peace treaty with Germany; then create peace with Japan, so that the post-war world can return to normal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In short, President Truman's welcoming speech is enough to inspire people of all countries with confidence in peace, and at the same time, the tense situation between the United States and the Soviet Union can gradually ease as a result, ushering in a beautiful prospect for the current international situation; however, whether this prospect can be realized and not shattered will depend on whether politicians from the United States and the Soviet Union can match their words with deeds. May the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union improve from now on!</p>

<h3>Suzhou and Wuxi Strengthen Public Security: Principal Culprits in Two Robbery Cases in Suzhou to Be Executed First; Those in Wuxi Who Fail to Register Households to Be Dealt with According to the Law</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper] In recent days, lawless thugs have been active inside and outside Suzhou City, and robbery cases have occurred repeatedly, even in broad daylight, without the slightest fear. The Suzhou City Defense Headquarters specially convened the heads of relevant units such as the local administrative police, military police, and self-defense forces on the 23rd to hold a symposium. Detailed discussions were held on improving the Baojia organization, adding street lights in the alleys, and opening door lights in the shops. It was also decided to extend the curfew hours, increase the police and military strength, and the personnel on duty at the city gates. The Winter Prevention and Security Conference will be held again on the 28th of this month to discuss winter prevention measures. As for the 11 bandits including Li Shiyong, Zhang Rong, and Chen Yiping who robbed Ge Yunbin's house at No. 45 Qiaosikong Alley in the city a few days ago, and the three habitual bandits Zhang Genhai, Zhang Fulin, and Zhang Aban who were previously arrested by the military police for robbing Chen Weigang, the chief of Tingxiang Township in Xijinqiao Town, the reporter inquired the person in charge of the City Defense Headquarters about the disposal measures. It was heard that the headquarters decided to execute the principal culprits in the two cases first within days in order to deter others, and then report the cases to the higher authorities.</p>
<p>[Report from Wuxi by this newspaper] The Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, in view of the fact that the bandits in the Jiangnan area have now been largely suppressed and that only a few remnant bandits are lurking in various places, which can be annihilated in one fell swoop in a short period of time, convened the heads of various agencies on the 22nd to hold the first public security meeting, which was presided over by Chief of Staff Mao Sen.

At noon on the former day, a Suzhou-Changzhou bus of the Xihu Company was driving from Changshu to Suzhou when three bandits (two in military uniforms and one in Zhongshan suits) who had boarded the bus beforehand suddenly showed box guns, ordered the driver to stop, and began to loot. After half an hour, a small car driving from Suzhou to Changzhou passed by and was also robbed. After a while, they took the small car to the vicinity of Likou in Suzhou, got out of the car and escaped.

<h3>Big Knife Society Discovered in Qimen Countryside</h3>
<p>[Report from Fuliang by this newspaper] In the western countryside of Qimen County, southern Anhui, adjacent to the border, a Big Knife Society has recently been discovered. It is active in the Zhuyuan Pancun area. The society uses "Tianyun" as its year title and attracts ignorant people, claiming that those who join the society cannot be invaded by knives, guns, water, or fire, and can eat without producing. Not a few suffering people have been misled into joining, which is a hidden danger to the local area in the future.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province's Construction Plan Proceeding Miserably: Work-Relief Obligatory Labor Being the Main Force; Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference Actually a "Flour and Noodle Conference"</h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou on the 24th by this newspaper] The Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference has ended. The discussion on various construction plans was quite detailed, but because it was affected by the deficit finance, the great plans could not succeed as desired. A commissioner smiled and told the reporter that this water conservancy and transportation conference was actually a "Flour and Noodle Conference". All the plans are based on national compulsory labor and Xingzong flour. Without the work-relief flour, everything will be stagnant! This is a very abnormal phenomenon. Director Pi of the Zhejiang Construction Department went to Beijing to consult with the central government on ways to improve the situation in order to relieve the province's financial situation. During this trip, Pi will also ask the China Farmers Bank to approve the appropriation of 1 billion yuan of Zhejiang Province's fishing loans. Last winter, Zhejiang Province requested the United General Office to allocate 500 million yuan of fishing loans, and it was not until this year that it was approved to allocate 35 million yuan. There are a total of 26,000 fishing boats in the province, and each boat only gets more than 1,300 yuan. During the fishing season this year, Zhejiang Province requested the allocation of 4 billion yuan of fishing loans, which is still awaiting Pi's direct negotiation with the United General Office.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou City Council Reviews Municipal Budget</h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou on the 24th by this newspaper] The Hangzhou City Council has convened a temporary meeting for several days in a row to preliminarily review the city government's financial budget for the second half of this year. The budget shows that due to the exhaustion of financial resources and the difficulty of construction, the City Council has carefully reviewed and plans to convene a second temporary meeting starting tomorrow. In addition to the report by the secretariat of the conference, Mayor Zhou, and the directors, the budget plan will be reviewed in detail, and it will also be discussed how to celebrate the Supreme Leader's 60th birthday and the city government's proposal to increase 100 yuan on entertainment donation tickets to subsidize demobilized soldiers.</p>
<h3>Lakeside Desolate, Paradise Bleak</h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou on the 24th by this newspaper] Prices in Hangzhou have soared recently, and civil servants and teachers are lamenting their suffering. The new standards have been set but not issued, and silver loans are nominally relaxed but secretly tightened, resulting in rampant usury. The market is becoming more and more bleak. Department stores are the first to bear the brunt. More than 20 stores have closed down because they cannot maintain their operations. Mayor Zhou Xiangxian originally placed the greatest hope on the prosperity of West Lake. The autumn wind is rustling, and there are few tourists. Boatmen and boat women gather to bask in the sun, and the lake is desolate.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Rice Market Plunges, Flour Far Exceeds the Price Limit</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou on the 24th by this newspaper] After Provincial Chairman Wang personally came to Suzhou to suppress and stabilize the situation of food grains, the situation of rice has become more and more normalized. The situation of hoarding and manipulating has disappeared, and the goods arriving from the countryside are surging, and the market is full of samples. Yesterday, white rice in the market had fallen by five levels, and the opening price was 48,000 yuan. The prices of other early rice and japonica rice have fallen across the board. However, the flour market is chaotic and the black market is rampant. The future evolution is extremely serious. Yesterday, Qidai Double Peach rushed to 21,000 yuan, exceeding the price limit by as much as 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Traitor Shen Jinghua Publicly Tried in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Liu Tingsheng Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>

After collecting evidence, there are about several charges, including: (1) Defection, (2) Betrayal of comrades, (3) Framing good people, (4) Collecting materials to supply the enemy and profiting from it, etc. He was immediately prosecuted, and the High Court scheduled the first public trial for 2 p.m. on the 25th. Wang Shubao, a co-conspirator and secret agent of the Kunshan Military Police Team of the enemy, will also be tried at the same time.</p>
<p>[Report from Suzhou on the 24th by this newspaper] Liu Tingsheng, a secret agent of the Jiangyin Military Police Team and an employee of the Puppet Seventh District, was tried and concluded by the Suzhou High Court. Because he killed patriots and extorted people, it was verified that he was sentenced to life imprisonment on the 24th and all his property was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Land Tax to Be Collected Immediately; Jiaxing Stipulates the Amount of Rent to Be Paid</h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxi] The land tax in this county will be collected immediately.

<p>[Report from Jiaxing] The collection of land tax in kind in this county is about to begin. All owners hope that the standard for tenants to pay rent will be decided as soon as possible so that they can be compensated. It has now been resolved that (1) the standard for the normal harvest yield per mu of early rice fields is one stone and four dou and five sheng. After deducting the 25% rent reduction, the rent amount to be paid per mu is five dou and four sheng and four he; (2) if one-fourth of the 25% rent reduction last year has not been reduced, it should be based on last year's standard. The rent that has been received and exceeds the standard should be deducted and returned; (3) each dou is calculated at 15 city catties.</p>

<h3>98-Catty Giant Turtle Captured Again After Being Released</h3>
<p>[Report from Haining] Qian Baotang, a resident of Dangtang Township in this county, caught a giant turtle weighing 98 catties in the river in front of his door on the 14th of last month.

Recently, the Hangzhou West Lake Museum suddenly sent a letter to this county, expressing its willingness to purchase the turtle for cash. The county government specially ordered the township to reward the recapture. The villager who captured the turtle can issue a price and sell it to the museum. If he is willing to donate it, the museum is willing to engrave his name in return.</p>

<h3>Reforming the Weak Literary Atmosphere: Suzhou Promotes Exercise</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 24th] Major General Ma Shigong, the paratrooper commander stationed in Suzhou and commander of city defense, has been stationed in Suzhou for two months. Observing that the people of Suzhou are physically weak and lack understanding of fitness and hygiene, which will be detrimental to the future of the nation, he has formulated a concrete plan to initiate the organization of a Committee for Promoting Exercise from All Circles in the county. He is calling on enlightened members of society to jointly support this effort.

All coastal ports are under strict guard.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Prepares for Waterworks: Shanghai-Based Gentry Invite Experts to Conduct Surveys</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Ningbo Dispatch] Liu Hongsheng and Li Shuxiong, gentry from Ningbo residing in Shanghai, in order to prepare for the construction of the Ningbo waterworks project, invited Mr. Bowen and Mr. Pullen, hydraulic engineers from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and Mr. Yang Kuanlin, dean of the St. John's University Engineering School, to Ningbo on the 20th of this month. They were accompanied by Mr. Chen Ru and Mr. Zhou Xinbai to conduct an on-site survey. After arriving in Ningbo, they frequently met with Commissioner Yu of the Sixth District and County Magistrate Chen, who both expressed strong support. They then appointed Ni Weixiong of the telephone company and Wang Dianzhang, head of the construction section, to discuss the matter with the American engineers. Whether the water source should be taken from the Yuyao River or from Dongqian Lake requires serious study. So, the next morning, they went to Dongqian Lake to inspect the water source and conduct some preliminary surveys. In the afternoon, they returned to Ningbo and inspected the Yuyao River again, also proposing to build a dam to store fresh water. The complete detailed plan will be studied in detail after returning to Shanghai. Reporter's note: The plan to establish waterworks in Ningbo dates back ten years, during the tenure of County Magistrate Chen Baolin. However, it was abandoned due to insufficient funds and manpower. This time, the old plan is being revived. If it is realized, it will truly be a blessing for the people of Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Zaozhuang Coal Mine Fortunately Preserved: Communist Troops Caused Extensive Damage During Their Retreat; Workers, Recognizing the Importance of the Greater Good, Risked Their Lives to Rescue It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou Dispatch] The former "New Fourth Army" 7th Division, 20th Brigade, and 21st Brigade, totaling approximately 20,000 men stationed in Zaozhuang, held a meeting on October 7th and decided to completely blow up the two generators and electric boilers at the Zaozhuang coal mine that could not be transported away, and to burn down all the buildings as much as possible. The workers pleaded for the preservation of the facilities, but to no avail. At 8:00 AM on the 8th, the mine's No. 3 4,000-kilowatt generator was blown up. At 9:30 AM, the No. 2 2,000-kilowatt generator was blown up, and all the buildings in the mine were also destroyed. The head of the Communist workers' detachment also placed a large landmine under the power plant and lit the No. 2 boiler. At this time, the rapid transport troops of the National Army had surrounded the Zhangzhuang area five miles north of Zaozhuang. The Communist troops fled in panic, and workers Chen Zhaowen, Zhao Wenlin, and more than 30 others seized the opportunity to remove the landmine. When the Communist cadres returned to the power plant to search for it, a certain regiment of the National Army suddenly entered the area and captured more than 50 people, including Zhang Fulin. When the workers saw the National Army entering Zaozhuang to provide comfort, the citizens were a hundred times more excited. They automatically pieced together and installed the remaining damaged parts and worked hard to repair the No. 1 generator to prevent flooding. By 4:00 PM on the 10th, the power plant was able to generate electricity and pump water. By 5:00 PM, all the lights in the mine were on. By 3:00 PM on the 11th, the Chen-appointed receiving committee for the mine sent more than ten people, including Chief Coal Engineer Lu, to Zaozhuang to supervise the repairs. The current pumping rate has reached 16 tons per minute, and the water level can be lowered by five or six inches per minute. It is estimated that the water can be completely pumped out in three months. There are currently more than 100,000 tons of coal stored in the mine, which is sufficient for the complete restoration of the mine. The technicians Chen Zhaowen, Zhao Wenlin, Zhang Xigui, and more than 30 others, who cared for the mining area and bravely carried out repairs, have reportedly been recommended by the General Labor Union for commendation by the Ministry of Social Affairs.</p>

<p>Questioning the Rejection of Public Treasury Checks</p>
<p>I am a civil servant in the rural area of this city and also handle administrative work. Due to my duties, I often have to deal with ordinary merchants, which causes a lot of trouble. The most troublesome thing is the public treasury checks. I have to beg and plead repeatedly before they are willing to accept them or put a stamp on the back of the check. For example, recently I went to Fufeng Paper Company on Zhongzheng East Road and asked them to stamp the checks for transactions in August and September. Not only were they unwilling, but they said contemptuously, "Our company doesn't accept public treasury checks. We don't want to do this kind of business at all. Why didn't you come to get it stamped back then?" Sir! The public treasury system was not created by us, and it also gives us a headache. For example, this month's expenses need to be issued at the end of the month or even at the beginning of the next month. Except for salaries and petty cash, all checks must be stamped with the store's seal before they can be withdrawn. Our agency is more than 30 li from Shanghai, and it costs a lot of money to come to Shanghai. Going to the city bank that acts as the public treasury also requires submitting to the resident auditing personnel for review. If you're unlucky, you have to wait for two hours to get the money. Therefore, we collect invoices for two or three months and ask the merchants to stamp them, which is also our helpless plight! Now, this situation has forced me to raise the following two questions and ask the relevant authorities for instructions:</p>
<p>(1) Is it reasonable for merchants to refuse to accept public treasury checks? What legal remedies are available? Can the police be asked to enforce the system (since the public treasury system is promulgated by national law)?</p>
<p>(2) If purchases this month must be paid with this month's checks, then we can only ask the financial and accounting authorities to issue regular expenses at the beginning of each month. Otherwise, we dare not even advance the money, because the merchants will not stamp the check after the time has passed! (Hao Ruo)</p>
<p>Please Expedite the Issuance of Victory Commemorative Medals</p>
<p>The most glorious page in the history of our country, the victory against Japan, can be said to be famous for all time and immortal! The price paid for this historical achievement was that our soldiers used our heads and shed hot blood, fought hard on the battlefields, fought north, south, east, and west, and suffered all kinds of hardships! In the past eight years, only our soldiers have tasted this kind of suffering, which everyone can agree on.</p>
<p>The government made and issued "Victory Against Japan Commemorative Medals" and "Orders of Merit" to reward meritorious personnel. Although we have no special meritorious performance, we have never left the army in the past eight years of the war. We have marched tens of thousands of miles, climbed mountains and waded through water, slept in the open and ate in the wind, and faced gunfire and rain of bullets. We can also call ourselves the honorable name of "Anti-Japanese Soldiers", and we are not boasting.</p>
<p>Last month, our team reported to receive this commemorative medal, but it can only be issued to those who have been appointed and served in battle by the Ministry of Personnel. Otherwise, it is not possible. We have all been appointed and served in positions, even repeatedly. The roster has been submitted to apply for the medal for almost a month, but there has been no news so far. We are now retired and about to return to our hometown. However, after participating in the eight-year war of resistance abroad, if we return to our hometown this time without any performance of anti-Japanese identity, we will feel ashamed! We respectfully ask the authorities to quickly issue the "Victory Against Japan Commemorative Medal" as soon as possible! (Retired Officers of the 49th Company of the 7th Battalion of the 17th Regiment of the Central Training Corps)</p>

<h3>UN General Assembly Begins General Debate: Shortening Speaking Time, Can Conclude in Four Days; Soviet Union Opposes Amendments Despite Five Powers' Veto Power</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Flushing, New York, 24th] The United Nations General Assembly, which officially opened yesterday, began general affairs today. Assembly President Spaak called on all representatives to shorten their speeches, so it is expected that the general debate can be concluded in four days. Then the six main committees will begin to deal with the world's major problems. In today's debate, any representative can speak on any topic they choose. The terms of the three Council seats of Mexico, Egypt, and the Netherlands on the Security Council will expire at the end of this year. The Assembly will elect their successors. The highest-rated candidates are Belgium, Colombia, and Syria. Molotov's warm response to President Truman's appeal has given many representatives hope that the East-West rift can be eliminated. Diplomats also feel that international resolutions can be established through harmonious opinions, without having to go through the path of voting and vetoing. However, some representatives feel that the Soviet Union may allow Yugoslavia or another small country to join the Security Council in order to strengthen the Slavic group's power in the Security Council together with Poland.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 24th, United Press] After Truman delivered his wise words at the United Nations General Assembly, he returned to Washington at midnight. After the opening ceremony of the General Assembly, the Soviet Union began to fight those who wanted to change the five powers' veto power. Today, Caolotov warned other major countries that the Soviet Union was prepared to demand that the Assembly or the committee reject a full debate on the veto issue. Ancient, Phi, Australia, and other countries outside the five powers are striving for the complete abolition of the veto power or explicitly stipulating restrictions on its use in the Charter. If the Soviet Union succeeds in preventing the debate on the veto power in the 14-nation committee, the efforts of countries such as Cuba will be in vain. At an informal meeting of the committee last night, Soviet representative Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union opposed five provisions in the General Assembly's provisional motion, all of which were related to the veto power. Vyshinsky's opposition failed to gain the support of the United Kingdom and the United States. In his speech yesterday, Dumen clearly stated that the United States supports full discussion of the veto power, and even amending the veto power. British Prime Minister Attlee also expressed his support in the House of Commons for reviewing the veto power to make it consistent with the original intention of those who drafted the Charter. Today, the Soviet capital's radio station attacked Attlee as an "enemy of peace" because he was seeking restrictions on the veto power. Cuba proposed convening a meeting of representatives from 52 countries to remove the provisions on the veto power from the Charter. Vyshinsky opposed this move and tried to prevent it from being included on the agenda.</p>
<h3>Chairman Spaak Describes the Main Purpose of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>Cultivating Mutual Understanding and Virtues, Jointly Promoting Major Tasks</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd, Special Dispatch] Spaak, Chairman of the United Nations General Assembly, stated the main purpose of the General Assembly at the General Assembly and jointly and enthusiastically called on other representatives to find ways to enhance and generate a "common international spirit" and cultivate the "virtue of mutual understanding," and to take both as the starting point of this world organization, thereby promoting its important responsibilities. The short and concise Foreign Minister Spaak also frankly stated that there are still many obstacles to the future of international cooperation, but these obstacles can be overcome. He further explained that our goals are the same, but our reactions and methods of thinking and discussion are often difficult to be permanently consistent. There are differences in race and temperament between us, so conflicts sometimes occur over direct interests. There are various obstacles to the international future, and it is absurd and dangerous to ignore this. However, these obstacles can hardly be overcome without generosity, wisdom, and absolute necessity.</p>
<p>Mr. Qi also told people around the world that the world's top diplomats have gathered here to "seek a balance of our individual interests." He suggested the following work methods, that is, let us try to work, work not just for empty talk, but to adopt sound methods to achieve concrete results. The result is a clear and true thing, and it is also what the people who are expecting and are anxious about are looking forward to us. We should avoid lengthy general discussions and discuss all issues with an honest, courageous, and agile attitude. Mr. Si also gave a powerful answer to those who doubted the United Nations organization, saying, "Can they suggest any better organization than the United Nations? Are they still not clear about this dilemma, which is actually very simple? If we do not succeed, the world will fall into chaos and eventually lead to war." Previously, Spaak celebrated the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union had both taken active actions in the United Nations, rather than adopting isolationist policies after the First World War. He then expressed his deep gratitude to President Truman for attending the first meeting of the General Assembly and deeply commemorated the achievements of the late US President Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>Our Delegation Attends the General Assembly</h3>
<p>Ten Newspaper Reporters Listen In</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Special Correspondent, New York, 23rd] The United Nations General Assembly officially opened in New York today. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, arrived here from Washington. He was wearing a gray suit and attended the General Assembly. Representative Guo Taiqi arrived here from Paris on Monday, wearing a black suit, and sat next to Gu. Before the meeting, the two skilled Chinese diplomats had been constantly talking earnestly. Other Chinese representatives, including Vice Minister Liu Zuo, Dr. Zhang Pengchun, and Xie Jinlin, also attended. The seats of the Chinese representatives were arranged in the middle row of the third row. There were ten Chinese newspaper reporters in attendance, including reporters from Chinese-language newspapers published by overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Jin Yangrong Sends Letter to Lay: Condemning the Division of Korea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd, United Press] Jin Yangrong, president of the US-Korean Association, recently wrote to UN Secretary-General Lay condemning the division of Korea into north and south along the 38th parallel, saying that this is a "direct violation of the principles and purposes of the United Nations." He also firmly stated that the United Nations should respect the will of the Korean people.</p>
<h3>The United States Decides to Provide Aid to Italy to Solve Post-War Problems</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] US Secretary of State Bernardes telegraphed the new Italian Foreign Minister Nanni today, saying that the American people are determined to fully assist Italy in solving post-war problems, and he is very happy to work to strengthen the close ties between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Scenes from the Meeting: Truman and Molotov Warmly Shake Hands and Congratulate Each Other</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] After President Truman finished his speech at the United Nations General Assembly today, when he walked past Molotov, Mr. Mo greeted President Du in Russian, saying, "Molotov sincerely congratulates the President on his speech. He thinks this speech is very great." Mr. Du replied, "I am very grateful." This was the first time that Molotov and Truman had met again since Molotov attended the United Nations Organization General Assembly last year and passed through Washington to meet with Truman. The opening ceremony was 15 minutes later than scheduled because Chairman Spaak was waiting for the English translation of his opening speech to the General Assembly. The translation of Mr. Lu's speech was placed at the United Nations' temporary headquarters at Success Lake. When a messenger came to pick it up, he argued with the security guards at the door for a while before being allowed to enter the meeting place. The names of the representatives of various countries who attended today's meeting were like an international biographical dictionary, including prime ministers, foreign ministers, and ambassadors, etc. The number of foreign ministers exceeded 20. The only member of the royal family was Prince Faisal, son and foreign minister of the King of Saudi Arabia. Although President Truman was the most prominent figure attending today's meeting, the movements of Bernardes and Molotov were actually attracting more attention. These two are currently the symbols of the so-called East-West group dispute. After the opening of the General Assembly, Molotov left the venue and the Soviet delegation was led by Vice Minister Vyshinsky. Bernerd led the US delegation with Senator Austin. The front row of the meeting place was for the representatives of the three powers, with the United Kingdom first, followed by the Soviet Union, and the United States third. Among the 500 representatives and deputy representatives, there were twelve women representatives. The most famous one was Mrs. Roosevelt. El Salvador sent two women representatives, and the remaining nine countries each sent one woman representative, namely China, India, Paraguay, Dominica, Ecuador, New Zealand, Cuba, Luxembourg, and Panama.</p>

Thereafter, the station's relay will begin at 3:45 PM every day at the original scheduled time of KRHO, with a frequency of 660 kHz. Listeners everywhere should be able to tune in more easily.</p>
<h3>US Congressman Proposes International Court: Marshal Tito, President of South, Be Brought to Trial; Yesterday He Made a Request to Bernardes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] US Congressman McDono today asked Secretary of State Bernardes to bring Marshal Tito, President of Yugoslavia, to trial before the International Court of Justice because a South Korean aircraft shot down an unarmed US aircraft, killing five American pilots. He said: If the Nuremberg trials were a lesson that anyone who disrupts peace must be tried before the International Court of Justice, then this method should now be applied to Tito.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of German Technicians Are Being Evacuated to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Factory Machinery Is Also Being Moved Away</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 24th] A senior US official told United Press reporters today that the Soviet Union is evacuating a large number of German technicians to the Soviet Union and dismantling machinery from factories. The evacuation of technicians and machinery is limited to the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the Soviet-controlled area of Berlin. There is no news of the evacuation of German technical personnel from other occupied zones. He also said that dismantling work is underway at the Askania rangefinder factory in Berlin, the Zeiss academic instrument factory in Jena, the Junckers aircraft factory in Dansa, and the Seibel aircraft parts factory in Halle.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Sets Up a Special Committee to Supervise Collective Farms</h3>
<p>The Fourth Demobilization Order Is Issued</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 23rd] The Soviet government today entrusted great power to the newly established Collective Farm Committee, ordering it to eliminate corruption and parasitic elements who evade production work. According to the decree, this committee will prevent public farms from being plundered, infringed upon, and used by corrupt elements for speculation and personal gain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 23rd] The Soviet authorities today issued the fourth demobilization order since the end of the war, stating only that soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the next grade will be discharged from November to January. Age limits and the number of retirees were not announced. The Soviet Union announced a new budget last week, in which military spending was only half of what it was during the war.</p>
<h3>The Veto Power of Refugee Trusteeship: A Review of the Four Powers' Policies; There Will Be a Fierce Dispute at the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 24th, Special Dispatch] The success or failure of this United Nations General Assembly depends on the ability of the major powers to coordinate their international policies. The policies of the major powers, mainly, will be expressed in the debates on the three major issues of refugees, trusteeship, and veto power. The following are brief descriptions of the various objectives that the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France want to achieve in the world parliament, based on the current indications. (1) United States: On the veto power, the US delegation will condemn the Soviet Union's abuse of the veto power. The United States will undoubtedly support the application of the veto power, which must be restrained. In terms of trusteeship, the United States will prevent the General Assembly from determining the fate of the former Japanese trust territories currently occupied by the United States before the signing of the Japanese peace treaty. If the United States puts these islands under the rule of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, it is believed that the United States will insist that the United Nations has the power to supervise the trust territories, which may conflict with the Soviet Union's policy, because the Soviet Union may consider obtaining superficial supervisory power over the trust territories and will not welcome it. On the issue of refugees, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly start another debate on the proposed funding of the World Refugee Organization and the right of displaced people to return to their home countries. (2) Soviet Union: On the veto power, the Soviet Union will strongly resist any attempt to abolish or change the veto power. On the issue of refugees, unless the World Refugee Organization refuses to assist Soviet political enemies in United Nations refugee camps, the Soviet Union will not provide economic assistance to refugees. There are two other issues that the Soviet Union will try its best to insist on: one is the withdrawal of US troops from "non-enemy" countries, and the other is the exclusion of Franco's Spain from all United Nations special agencies. (3) United Kingdom: On the refugee issue, it will strongly demand joint action with the United States to immediately establish an international refugee organization to entrust the displaced people in United Nations refugee camps. Regarding trusteeship, the United Kingdom will insist on the early establishment of the Trusteeship Council. Regarding the veto power, the United Kingdom will support the rule of unanimity among the five powers and will suggest that the provisions in the Charter stipulating the veto power be interpreted progressively to avoid its abuse. (4) France: On the veto power, it is believed that France will insist on its veto power. Regarding the issue of trusteeship, France will act as a buffer and mediator when discussing the issue of trusteeship, with the status of being the first to submit a trusteeship agreement to the United Nations. On Franco's Spain, France will support the Soviet Union's position because France is strongly opposed to Franco's Spain joining any United Nations agency.</p>
<h3>Undermining the Yalta Guarantees: Soviet Union Massively Stationing Troops in Eastern Europe; Churchill Raises Startling Questions to the Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 23rd, United Press] Churchill, in a speech to the House of Commons today, condemned the Soviet Union for undermining its guarantees made at Yalta and criticized the Soviet Union for maintaining over two hundred divisions of troops in a "wartime footing" in its Eastern European occupation zone. Churchill stated that during Hitler's era, it was easier to sense and predict the general direction of certain events. Today, we do not need to consider how to deal with Hitler and his cruel, anti-Semitic Nazi party, of which anti-Semitism was the core tenet. What we face today is more difficult to grasp than what was openly laid out in "Mein Kampf." What we face today is a collective of ideas whose actions we cannot determine the origin of. In the Kremlin, there are thirteen or fourteen shrewd and capable individuals who hold control over the entire Soviet Union and more than one-third of Europe.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] British opposition leader and former Prime Minister Churchill gave a speech in the House of Commons today, questioning whether it was true that two hundred divisions of Soviet troops were stationed in Europe. Political observers believe this is Churchill's cunning plan to force the government into a corner. Undersecretary McNeil narrowly avoided the trap, as if McNeil had replied that the government was unaware of the stationing of such a large army, Churchill would have questioned whether the revelation of this information would change the government's policy. Conversely, if McNeil had admitted that this figure was accurate, Churchill would have questioned whether the government would take countermeasures against such a concentration of forces to prevent armed conflict in Europe. McNeil almost replied that, given the progress of democracy in the Soviet Union, this number was not particularly alarming, but McNeil only stated that although the Soviet Union had a large number of troops stationed in Europe, he was not as pessimistic as Churchill. He also expressed skepticism about the figures mentioned by Churchill.</p>
<h3>If Jews Can Establish a Nation, They Are Willing to Grant the UK a Base</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] Gotteinman, US-based Executive Committee Member of the Jewish Agency, who just returned here from London after meeting with British Foreign Secretary Bevin and others, stated: If Britain could see the establishment of a fully independent Jewish state on 65 percent of the land in all of Palestine, then the Jews are willing to grant Britain the full right to establish land and air bases in Palestine. However, if Britain continues to implement its current repressive policies, then the Jewish people are determined to resist with all their might.</p>
<h3>Fortresses Built on Franco-Spanish Border</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] Agence France-Presse reports: General Franco's troops began constructing large-scale fortress works along the Spanish-French border yesterday. The scale is no less than the former German West Wall, including underground structures and reinforced concrete bunkers.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Recovers Health; To Fly to Canada for Visit at Month's End</h3>

<h3>US Has a Million-Strong Navy, Ready to Mobilize and Respond; Nimitz Gave a Speech Yesterday; Truman Denies Navy Secretary and Others Have Resigned</h3>
<p>[United Press, United States, Detroit, 24th] Admiral Nimitz told reporters today: The United States Navy can mobilize one million trained officers and sailors to cope with "any changes that may occur in the next two or three years."

<h3>British Prime Minister Delivers Speech, Fiercely Criticizing the Communist Party, Saying It Creates Division and Suspicion Between Countries; Worries About the Future of the World Situation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] London, 24th Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech today at the British Trades Union Congress in Brighton, strongly criticizing the Communist Party. He stated, "Anyone who refuses to accept the orders of the Communist Party is branded as a fascist. Wherever the Communist Party has an advantage, it is considered democracy, and conversely, wherever the Communist Party loses power, it is labeled as fascism. For example, the Greek elections were held under international supervision, and as a result, the anti-communist faction prevailed, and the Communist Party immediately attacked it. On the other hand, the plebiscites held in places where the Communist Party is in power are praised as the sacred will of the people. The Soviet government seems to deliberately want to isolate the Soviet people from other people, which is a pity for the future of the world situation. Soviet newspapers deliberately make untrue propaganda about foreign situations, causing division and suspicion between countries. Some people may think that the Soviet system is most beneficial to workers and should welcome close contact between workers in various countries, but in fact, it goes against it. This policy is regrettable, and we cannot help but hope that the Soviet Union will change it."</p>

<h3>New Labor Strife Erupts Among British Tram Workers; Mayor Sets Deadline of Today to Resume Work; Labor Demands Should Undergo Legal Mediation; Inciters of Labor Strife Ordered Arrested</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Regarding yesterday's general strike by British tram workers, Mayor Wu met with reporters from various newspapers in the City Hall conference room at 4:30 PM yesterday to report on the facts of the matter and set a deadline for all to resume work this morning. The cause of the British tram workers' strike was the breakdown of negotiations with management. On September 24th of this year, the labor side put forward four demands: (1) Requesting the issuance of children's education expenses, with each employee receiving a loan of 100,000 yuan for tuition. (2) The base salary of the British collection clerks in the company is 40 yuan, while that of the French is 44 yuan, requesting the same treatment as the French tram company. (3) Requesting the adjustment of the Peace Award for drivers and ticket sellers, calculated according to the cost of living index. (4) Internal affairs and machine maintenance department workers requesting the issuance of uniforms. After the above demands were put forward, although negotiations were held repeatedly, no results were achieved. The union held a representative assembly the day before yesterday and decided to openly "invite guests" from 2 PM on the 24th. Unexpectedly, when the trams were dispatched yesterday morning, four workers blocked the trams on all routes, preventing them from leaving the depot, and under their call, a general strike was implemented.</p>
<p>I believe that employees in public service professions should have a spirit of service, and that the British tram company has gone on strike three times in one month over trivial issues, which is extremely unreasonable. The four workers dared to openly block the trams yesterday morning, which is an act that disrupts social order and violates Article 153 of the Criminal Law (anyone who publicly commits one of the following acts through words, pictures, speeches, or other methods shall be sentenced to imprisonment for no more than two years, detention, or a fine of no more than 1,000 yuan: (1) inciting others to commit crimes; (2) inciting others to violate laws or resist lawful orders). I have ordered the police to arrest these four people and send them to court for legal processing. At the same time, the union has been warned that all must resume work from the 25th. Even if negotiations break down, the demands put forward by the labor side should be mediated by the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau. Strikes and "inviting guests" are both illegal actions, he said.</p>
<p>Finally, the mayor solemnly declared: Today's strike atmosphere has lost the sympathy of society. I would like to propose the slogan "Striking is easy, resuming work is difficult." If the British tram company does not resume work tomorrow (i.e., today), it will be considered automatic dismissal. It will not be so easy to ask to resume work in the future. Moreover, the company authorities can review the list of workers, and disruptive elements with bad conduct may not be approved. The above opinions are based entirely on a neutral position and are absolutely not biased, he said.</p>
<p>After the meeting, a reporter asked how to curb the trend of soldiers riding the bus without tickets. Mayor Wu said: A joint announcement will be issued with the Garrison Headquarters to strictly prohibit soldiers from riding without tickets.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also said: The foreman system at the rice wharves on the Suzhou River in this city is unreasonable. It is said that the handling fee for each bag of rice is 300 yuan, while the foreman must extract 210 yuan, and the workers actually receive only 90 yuan. This kind of cannibalistic system must be improved.</p>

After the victory, only a small number of lone soldiers remained, with no home to return to, and many were old, weak, and disabled, still staying in Shanghai, living a hard life.

<h3>Chairman Fang Receives Industrial and Commercial Circles, Hoping for Sincere Unity</h3>
<p>All the members of the Municipal Party Headquarters held a tea party yesterday afternoon at the Sado Ballroom to receive the industrial and commercial circles of this city. More than 150 people attended, including Xu Jiyun, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, all directors and supervisors of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and chairmen of various trade associations. First, Chairman Fang gave a speech, stating his hopes for people in the industrial and commercial circles, saying: The development of commerce can improve the general level of culture and is also used to prosper the rural economy and promote international prosperity, so the responsibilities borne by people in the commercial circles are extremely important. However, in the current domestic situation, most factories have stopped production, and production and consumption are fundamentally disconnected. If the country is still like this, it is useless to discuss the development of international trade. The central government definitely has good plans for industry and commerce, but these good resolutions have not been effectively implemented. On the other hand, capitalists with idle funds are unwilling to invest in industry. All of this makes it difficult for industry and commerce to develop. In the future, I hope that the government will sincerely support industry and commerce and effectively implement the established plans. Industry and commerce themselves must also be truly united and take on the responsibility of prospering commerce. Then, Xu Jiyun, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stood up and gave a speech, briefly describing the history of cooperation between the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Party Headquarters in the past. At the same time, he hoped that people in the industrial and commercial circles would recognize the domestic political line and work together to seek the development of industry and commerce. Subsequently, Wang Yansong of the silk and satin industry, Wang Jingdong of the rubber industry, and Tang Zuxiang, a representative of the military uniform industry association, expressed their opinions one after another, all hoping that the government would effectively support industry and commerce, and at the same time expressed their willingness to cooperate sincerely with party headquarters at all levels. Finally, Chairman Fang summarized the opinions of all parties and stood up to give a speech, saying: The Municipal Party Headquarters is determined to maintain close contact with the people, seek happiness for the people, strengthen the Party Headquarters' organization and training of the people, and hopes that people in the industrial and commercial circles will be sincerely united. The tea party ended at around 5 PM.</p>
<h3>Land Registration Deadline at Month's End; Director of Land Administration Bureau Inspects City Suburbs</h3>

<h3>A Pair of Stone Figures Beside the Racecourse is About to Say Goodbye; Moller Writes to the Authorities Asking for Them to Be Moved</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Ever since the American company MGM decided to build the best movie theater in the Far East on the vacant lot at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Bubbling Well Road, the fate of the two stone figures (see picture) living there is about to end. The land was originally the site of Moller &amp; Co., and the two stone figures were originally from the tomb of a certain family in the racecourse. When Moller built a new house in West Bridge, they were moved here as decorations. Unexpectedly, many Chinese people are superstitious and worship them as gods, with the words "Requests are Always Granted" written on them. Incense in front of the stone statues never stops, and many pious pilgrims come from afar; and many grooms who participated in horse racing also go to pray. Therefore, Moller recently wrote to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, requesting that the two figures be moved to the side gate of the racecourse on Mandelane Road, so that the grooms can continue to worship. However, the Bureau of Public Works believes that this facility is obviously promoting superstition, and the gathering of people for worship will hinder traffic and affect the appearance, so it is difficult to approve. In short, this pair of figures will inevitably be moved soon, but where they will be moved is still unknown.</p>

<h3>Robbery and Extortion - Thirteen Young Robbers Arrested in One Day for Numerous Crimes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Criminal Investigation Division of the Police Bureau apprehended thirteen robbers on the 12th of this month. What is most distressing is that they are all knowledgeable young men in their twenties. Moreover, they are seasoned in this path and have committed numerous crimes. In their last act, they were well aware that the life of an outlaw was not a long-term plan. They changed their appearance, under the guise of an official organization, hoping to defraud a large sum of money and establish a business, changing professions. Unexpectedly, the net of justice is wide, and their treacherous schemes were thwarted, and they were apprehended by the police. On the 11th, the police received a tip that a large group of bandits were hiding at No. 66 Limar Road in the South City. At 00:30 on the 12th, Detective Feng Qishan, Zhang Changgui, and Chen Xianrong, along with officers Zhang Jingyu and Ding Wenjiang, rushed to the scene. They arrested Wang Fuyi, a 23-year-old from Beiping, on the third floor. A pistol and nineteen bullets were found next to the escalator on the third floor. Wang confessed that his accomplices were hiding at No. 1 and No. 4, Lane 891, Huangpi Road. The police proceeded to those addresses. They first arrested Huang Jin at No. 1 and confiscated a pistol.</p>
<p>Flipping Over Roofs in Attempt to Escape, Ultimately Captured</p>
<p>When the police arrived at No. 4, the bandit Wu Debao (age 23, from Ningbo), knowing that their cover was blown, climbed onto the roof from the balcony and fled to the back building of No. 903 South Huangpi Road, hiding under a bed. However, he was eventually discovered by Detective Feng, who bravely captured him. After interrogation at the police station, Huang confessed that the pistol belonged to Xu Xinglou (residing at No. 12, Tianhe Lane, West Gate Road). As dawn was approaching, the police, seeking to round up all the suspects, dispatched some officers to guard the bandits' dens, and rushed to Tianhe Lane. That day, Xu and another accomplice, Zhang Shoubai, were waiting at the home of the victim, Pan Yijun, due to suspicions of extortion related to treason. Only another accomplice, Tang Junhua, was apprehended there. Subsequently, Xu and Zhang were arrested at the home of the victim, Pan Yijun, at No. 18, Yong'an Lane, Yong'an Street. Meanwhile, the officers guarding the bandits' dens successively arrested accomplices Chen Zonghao, confiscating a six-round pistol, as well as Geng Ruizhang, Wei Chaohua, Xia Yuren, Huang Ronggen, Ge Shuqi, and Li Ming, totaling thirteen people. According to Wei, another pistol was hidden with Zhang Wenkui, a soldier in the guard of the Fuxing Island Naval Training Camp. The police, along with military police, went there, but Zhang Wenkui had already fled. Only a pistol and five bullets were found in his luggage.</p>
<p>Confessed to Robberies and Extortions - Six Times in Total</p>
<p>After days of investigation by the police, the robbers have confessed to the following robberies: (1) No. 8, Dongping Lane, Caojia Street, Old West Gate, on June 20th; (2) No. 268, Yiding Lane, Jiangsu Road, on September 5th; (3) No. 5, Qingsheng Lane, Zhonghua Road, on September 30th; (4) No. 8, Lane 273, Duolun Road, on September 24th; (5) The home of Zheng Miaoyun, Room 24, Peien Apartments, South Chongqing Road, on October 3rd; (6) No. 5, Hongyefang, Lujiabang Road, on October 6th. There was also a case of intimidation and deprivation of freedom. Because they feared that they would eventually be caught, Xu Xinglou, Zhang Shoubai, Tang Junhua, and others suggested finding another way out. On the 9th of this month, they impersonated an organization, wore firearms, and went to Pan Yijun's place at No. 20, Tongkang Lane, Huasheng Road, accusing Pan of being a traitor and claiming to be under orders to arrest him. Pan's friend, Feng Baoyong, intervened and arranged a negotiation at Guanshengyuan on Jinling Road. There, Xu and the others proposed that if Pan could invest 20 million yuan in their Xinghua Trading Company, they would drop the case. Feng agreed to relay the message and rescheduled the meeting for 8 PM on Double Ten Day at the Paradise Hall on the eighth floor of the Jinmen Hotel. At that time, Pan was unable to raise the large sum and asked Feng to refuse on his behalf. Xu and his accomplices turned their anger towards Feng, and Tang Junhua took Feng back to the bandits' den to be held in custody. Meanwhile, they went to Pan's place, but Pan had already fled. However, they had learned that Pan's wife lived at No. 18, Yong'an Lane, Yong'an Street, so Xu and Zhang went there to monitor her movements, intending to wait for her husband. They were arrested by the police who had been tracking them. Among the stolen items from the above robberies, there was a diamond ring weighing 5.20 carats belonging to Zheng Miaoyun, as well as countless gold ornaments, clothing, and cash. Some of the stolen goods have been recovered by the police, and the victims have identified the suspects without error. The entire case will be transferred to the Garrison Command today for legal proceedings.</p>

<h3>Ten Employers in the Fashion Industry Fail to Comply with Settlement Records; No One Summoned to Court Hearing</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Employees in the Department Store Group (specializing in shirts and underwear) of the fashion industry in this city requested improved treatment in March of this year, leading to a labor dispute. On March 25th, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs mediated and established a settlement record with the number (three five) Labor Two, number three one seven nine was issued notifying both labor and management to faithfully comply. However, ten employers, including Wang Xingji, Weihua, Qichang, Maoji, Huaxing, Tangsheng, Maosheng, Jiang Fusheng, Huaxiang, and Meiyi, have delayed in fulfilling the various items stipulated in the settlement record. After both parties appealed to the Bureau of Social Affairs again, the bureau continued on June 19th, ordering the fulfillment of the record, but the ten, Weihua and the others, ignored it. The Bureau of Social Affairs believes that the ten merchants are disregarding the law, so the entire case was sent to the District Court for enforcement. Yesterday, the Twelfth Civil Division of the District Court heard the case. Because the addresses of the ten merchants were unknown, they were not summoned. The labor representative, Zhang Bochen, appeared in court to respond. After a brief questioning in court, Zhang Bochen was ordered to submit a supplementary complaint, detailing the addresses and names of the employers, as well as the names of the persons in charge of each business. The non-complying businesses will be summoned to court again on the 31st of this month for enforcement.</p>

<p>— Huang Jiamou</p>
<p>Taking Items from Pockets as if Plucking Them; Disappearing Without a Trace</p>
<p>When pickpocketing gangs "do business," they usually form small groups of three to five people, often dressed neatly, resembling merchants or students. Places with high foot traffic and crowded passengers are their ideal locations. Seasoned pickpockets can make items disappear from the victim's pockets without their knowledge. They use small blades to cut open the victim's outer clothing, and then they cut open the money-filled belt. (Early merchants often hid their money in a belt near the buckle.) They steal all the money. Pickpocketing gangs have a superstition that they must steal everything; if they leave some behind, something unlucky will happen.</p>
<p>They can also use smoke bombs to obscure the customers' vision. For example, they use a newspaper to cover the customer's view, and the third hand reaches under the newspaper to the customer's clothes. Sometimes they have an accomplice knock the customer's hat off, and when the customer bends over to pick it up, the pickpocket seizes the opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, people have generally preferred to use handbags instead of pockets in their trousers, which is the thing that pickpocket gangs hate the most, because the bag is held tightly in the left hand, making it impossible to move. In the early years, when gold chains were popular, all respectable people liked to use them, especially those wearing Western suits, who would display their gold watch chains outside their vest pockets, showing off everywhere. But in the blink of an eye, they would fall into the hands of pickpockets. The substitutes that were developed followed, which were Parker pens, etc., hung on the small pockets of Western suits. These valuable American goods were all the rage in Shanghai a decade ago. The price was high, no matter if the pens were new or used. The thieves could get rid of them easily, so stealing them became common. This type of theft was called "eating steel pens," or "eating big draws."</p>
<p>If a pickpocket was caught stealing a metal pen, or if they did not have time to hide it and someone noticed, they would have to be extremely alert. The pickpocket would throw the pen on the ground or on the floor of the tram, and immediately kick it aside. An accomplice would be waiting to pick it up and return the pen to the owner, who might even thank them.</p>
<p>Wharf Activities: Combining Soft and Hard Tactics</p>
<p>"Running the base" refers to the "pickpocketing gangs" that are dispatched to operate at the wharves. "Base" is a slang term for "ship." Shanghai was a prosperous port, and the wharves were scattered along the banks of the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek. Before the war, countless ships docked at and departed from the wharves every day. Operating in this area naturally offered significant benefits, but the all-powerful 36 Gangs had already occupied the territory. The "Old Brothers Gang's" "pickpocketing gang" was ultimately weak and lacked influence, so they could not compete. But where there were benefits, the pickpocketing gangs never gave up. However, only the "respectable" older members of the Old Brothers Gang could participate in "running the base." At the same time, they needed special powers to protect their occupied wharves and prevent aggression from other gangs. This required using tactics, combining soft and hard approaches, and using the art of "building relationships." They would select talented individuals from among their peers, bring them in as "fellow pickpocketing brothers," and try to bring in new members to help them. The more gang members they had, the more glamorous their status became. Thus, they could attack or defend, and look for opportunities to make money in their territory. Therefore, whether they were "uncles" or "devils" (partners), they had to be agile and dress neatly, otherwise they could not operate on the wharves.</p>
<p>Amphibious Operations: Masterful Accomplishments</p>
<p>The activities of the "running the base" gang were divided into three major categories:</p>
<p>"Warehouse" - "Warehouse" is a slang term for cargo warehouses. All theft of goods being unloaded from ships or loaded onto ships from warehouses was the gang's specialty. When goods were unloaded and passed through the wharf, small groups of three to five "warehouse" members would take advantage of the busy unloading process to "cut off some vegetables" from the outside of the packages. Although the amount taken was small, it accumulated into substantial profits. Even if the cargo owner found out, the loss was limited, so they would not quibble. If an entire item was stolen, the cargo owner and the person in charge would have to pay compensation, inevitably leading to conflict.</p>
<p>As for why the porters would not stop them when they saw packages being cut, experienced porters earn their wages with sweat and blood. Why should they offend the strong? They are not familiar with the cargo owner anyway, and even if they defended the goods, the cargo owner would never "issue a commendation." Instead, they would make the old brothers resent them, and they would immediately gather a crowd to cause trouble and "give you color" (punish you). If the goods had already been transported from the warehouse to a barge, when the barge was still docked and had not yet set sail, it was a golden opportunity. The old brothers would unceremoniously steal the entire item. Because at this point, the warehouse was no longer responsible, and the loss belonged to the cargo owner or the barge owner. The theft route was either by water or by land, mostly using small rowboats. This action was always somewhat dangerous, often requiring a full-scale performance. Experienced barge owners, in order to avoid trouble, often made deals with the "uncle gangs" in advance, allowing them a certain amount of money to ensure safety. The "uncles" were naturally happy to enjoy this kind of "peaceful income" and even considered themselves to be "building relationships."</p>
<p>Extortion and Fraud: A Mix of Laughter and Tears</p>
<p>"Full Mouth Pick" - This is a collective term for extorting smugglers. Smuggling has always been rampant in Shanghai's wharves. Most of these could be agreed upon verbally, so the profits were high, and there was no need for much fighting. It was almost entirely a matter of diplomatic skills. However, those engaged in this profession needed to have many years of experience and a keen eye. When they saw someone transporting smuggled goods or contraband, they would step forward and question them. The barge owners, with a guilty conscience, would have to spend money to silence them. The types of smuggled goods and contraband, and the gang's slang, are as follows:</p>
<p>Item Name: Slang</p>
<p>Opium: Black Old</p>
<p>Private Dust: White Old</p>
<p>Smuggled Grains: Wine Pearls</p>
<p>Smuggled Inferior Auxiliary Coins: Ancient Gun Screws</p>
<p>Smuggled Inferior Copper Coins: Yellow Millet</p>
<p>Firearms and Ammunition: Board Head</p>
<p>Bullets: Connected Hearts</p>
<p>Obscene Pictures: (Slang Unknown)</p>

<p>[Our Report] The District Court has completed the trial of the embezzlement case involving the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration. The verdict was announced at 10:00 AM yesterday in the Eighth Criminal Court. Thirteen defendants, including Zhang Hongtu and Yu Xiangyan, who were in custody, were brought in from the detention center at 9:30 AM. Of the twenty-three defendants who were released on bail, only eight appeared. Twenty-two proxy lawyers all appeared in court to hear the verdict. The audience section was as crowded as before. Presiding Judge Mei Erhe and Judge Tie Changzhuan, accompanied by the court clerk, appeared on time. After Judge Mei asked each defendant their name, age, hometown, and address, he stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Zhang Hongtu, Zhang Bowei Kangjing Jun, Chen Jingyao, Zhuang Renmao Zhu Biwen, Zhang Kaiyuan, Zhang Zelong, Zhu Peizong, Gu Zhenmin, Yu Peien, Xia Dingwu, Sun Xuesan, Li Jie, Xu Chuangui, Cai Zhidao, He Zuen, Yu Xiangyan, Yu Zhonglu, Jin Yunting, Cao Zuxin, Li Fenbin, Wu Lianqing, Xia Zhaozhen, Yu Kanghou, Yang Wenli, Shen Yunsheng, Zhou Jinhua, Xu Binghong, Yu Yifu, and Li Hangxin, jointly and continuously sought direct profit from the affairs they were in charge of. Zhang Hongtu and Yu Xiangyan are each sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Zhang Bokang is sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights.

<p>The assets obtained by Yu Xiangyan, amounting to 24 million yuan, the assets obtained by Zhang Bokang, amounting to 15.993 million yuan, and deposits of 12.873 million yuan, the assets obtained by Jing Weijun, amounting to 940,000 yuan, and two checks amounting to 28.97737 million yuan, the assets obtained by Zhang Zelong, amounting to 1.22 million yuan, the assets obtained by Gu Zhenmin, amounting to 890,000 yuan, the assets obtained by Li Jie, amounting to 770,000 yuan, the assets obtained by Chen Jingyao, amounting to 890,000 yuan, the assets obtained by Zhu Biwen, amounting to 890,000 yuan, the assets obtained by Zhu Peizong, amounting to 890,000 yuan, the assets obtained by Zhang Kaiyuan, amounting to 290,000 yuan, the assets obtained by Wang Renmao, amounting to 290,000 yuan, the assets obtained by Sun Xuesan, amounting to 200,000 yuan, the assets obtained by Xu Chuangui, amounting to 600,000 yuan, the assets obtained by Cai Zhidao, amounting to 700,000 yuan, the assets obtained by He Zuen, amounting to 600,000 yuan, the assets obtained by Xia Dingwu, amounting to 750,000 yuan, and the assets obtained by Yu Peien, amounting to 750,000 yuan, shall all be recovered."</p>
<p>After Judge Mei finished reading the main text, he explained in a gentle tone, "The purchasing department staff of the Road Bureau colluded with merchants, used their position to illegally receive commissions, or obtained property through loans, continuously for several months, constituting the crime under Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. Therefore, they are all punished. If they disagree with the judgment or believe that the cited articles are inappropriate, they can apply for retrial within ten days after receiving the judgment." After speaking, he announced the adjournment. Zhang Hongtu and his wife Yu Xiangyan, the former director of the Materials Department, showed no expression and were extremely calm. However, Zhang Bokang was dispirited after the verdict and almost collapsed. According to the lawyers of the defendants, they all felt that the sentence was too heavy and would appeal, especially regarding the punishment of the merchants who paid commissions as accomplices to corruption, believing that the sentence could be reduced after appeal.</p>
<h3>Chennault's Air Transport Team to Sign Contract This Morning; Flying Tigers to Undertake Flight Operations</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan has approved the General Administration of Relief and Rehabilitation (GARR) Air Transport Team, which will be managed by General Chennault. Chennault went to Nanjing on Monday to discuss the matter with relevant parties. After three days of discussions, both parties have largely resolved the points in the contract. Chen will return to Shanghai tomorrow evening and will sign the contract at the GARR at 10:30 AM this morning. The content of the contract will be publicly released after signing today. According to Chen, he will have further detailed discussions with the GARR and relevant parties in Shanghai regarding the future work of the air transport team, as well as financial issues. The nature of the air transport team is different from that of ordinary airlines. Its main task is to assist the GARR in transporting relief materials. The air transport team will also be terminated at the same time as the GARR. As for the twelve aircraft provided by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the US$2 million in funding provided by the GARR, they are still pending. Chen himself will also try to raise funds from various collaborators, aiming for US$1 million. Once all the issues are resolved, a contract will be signed in Qin and work will begin. The air transport team is under the GARR and serves the GARR, so it is very different from commercial airlines. Some of the Flying Tigers members who are participating in this work have come to China from the United States to undertake flight operations.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Fish Transportation Still Unresolved; No Fish Available in Markets Yesterday</h3>
<p>The dispute between pedicabs and trucks over the transportation of fish in this city has not yet been resolved through mediation. The fish market has been temporarily using its own trucks for transportation for several days. At the same time, relevant parties are negotiating to find a suitable solution. However, at approximately 4:00 AM yesterday, after most of the fish had been traded, a market closure occurred while the fish was being transported. Many people were talking at once, and all the traded goods waiting to be transported could not be shipped. Many asked for refunds, resulting in no fish being available in the markets yesterday. The fish that was stuck in the market was lost due to not being sold in time, which can be described as adding insult to injury. The market authorities have been working hard to negotiate for several days, and this change is truly unexpected.</p>
<p>Fishmongers Association Petitions the Mayor</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, more than one hundred members of the Fishmongers Association gathered at the entrance of the Municipal Government to request that the authorities stop the pedicab drivers from causing trouble. Wu Qiding, Zhao Zhixiang, Hu Rongfu, Yu Jingqing, and four others were selected as representatives to meet with the mayor and report the situation. Mayor Wu met with them, listened to the details, and said that the case would be jointly handled by the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Police Bureau.</p>
<h3>Finance and Budget Committee to Hold Subcommittee Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Finance Committee of the Municipal Council has scheduled a subcommittee meeting for 4:00 PM today at the committee's secretariat in Fuming Village. It is reported that the meeting will discuss issues related to the film industry and donations and taxes. The Budget Committee has also scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM today at the committee's office.</p>
<h3>Railway Workers Demand Adjusted Treatment; Stage Petition; Bureau Agrees to Consider</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, workers from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways submitted a request to the bureau to adjust their treatment. In the afternoon, dozens of worker representatives staged a petition in the square in front of the office building. The bureau has agreed to consider the workers' demands. According to Director Chen Bozhuang, the treatment of workers on the two railways is already better than that of other railways. Low-level mechanics earn about 160,000 to 170,000 yuan per month, and non-mechanics earn 80% of that, about 130,000 to 140,000 yuan per month. Currently, the workers are requesting that their treatment be aligned with that of postal and telecommunications workers. The bureau is taking a "selfless and patriotic" attitude. However, the workers' stomachs must be filled first, so if the current treatment is indeed insufficient to maintain their livelihoods, the bureau will report to the Ministry of Communications to increase it appropriately.</p>
<p>Chen Bozhuang Goes to Nanjing</p>
<p>[Another Report] Chen Bozhuang, director of the two railways, and his secretary Sun Yafu took the evening train to Nanjing yesterday to visit the Ministry of Communications. It is reported that they will seek instructions on railway administration matters.</p>
<h3>Arrival of the Australian Steamer "Empress of Australia" in Shanghai: Carrying Over 300 Passengers, Staying Overnight and Departing This Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Changxing Shipping Company's Australian steamer "Empress of Australia" arrived in port yesterday afternoon and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou, carrying 377 passengers without any cargo. This is not only the first time the "Empress of Australia" has come to Shanghai since the war, but also it had never been here before the war. It used to sail between the United Kingdom and Canada across the Atlantic Ocean, never having sailed in the Far East Pacific. This time, it came for military service and is scheduled to sail to Japan this morning, carrying returning British troops for reassignment. Therefore, the import and export procedures were handled by the British Company, and the Changxing Company did not participate. The ship has a gross tonnage of over 38,000 tons and three funnels, with an unusually magnificent appearance. Currently, it is still a military transport ship, so it is entirely grey, with wartime equipment throughout.</p>
<p>Arrival of American Ships Still Pending</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The second strike of American sailors has spread across the country and is very serious. Almost all ships have stopped sailing, and it has been over a month without a resolution. On the 22nd, local merchants received a broadcast from San Francisco with news of a strike resolution. Inquiries with American shipping agencies revealed that they had not yet received any telegrams. Furthermore, even if the strike is resolved, ships will need time to load and unload cargo, so it is feared that they will not be able to sail immediately. The arrival of ships to Shanghai is still pending. Recently, American ships have been leaving Shanghai more than arriving, gradually decreasing in number. As of yesterday, the American President Lines had only six ships docked in Shanghai, and the Fulai Company had only one ship. Including other American company ships, the total number is less than ten.</p>
<p>It is reported that the President Lines will have a ship arriving in Shanghai tomorrow, named "Red Gauntlet," which departed from the United States before the strike. It is said to be carrying large quantities of commercial goods such as gasoline and cotton.</p>
<h3>Giant Panda Remains: Dissection Performed: Two Doctors Personally Take Action: To Continue This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The dissection of the giant panda remains, originally scheduled for the 22nd, was postponed due to insufficient preparation. It was rescheduled for yesterday at the National Market Management Office of the Public Works Bureau at No. 2 Julan Road. Two doctors, Zheng Qingduan and Qin Lirang, pathology research experts from the Central Animal Husbandry Experimental Institute, personally took action. U.S. Army Captain Kenningham and Dr. Xu Yinqi, head of the Biology Department and specimen expert at Soochow University, were also present. However, because the giant panda remains had been preserved in water for too long, the flesh had hardened. After only cutting open about eight inches of fur on the abdomen, they were unable to continue due to incomplete tools. It was rescheduled for this afternoon at the Central Animal Husbandry Experimental Institute at No. 200 Hongqiao Road.</p>
<h3>Road Administration on Two Railways: Urgent Need for Improvement: Responsible Personnel Discuss Plans: Hoping for Improvement Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our Special Feature] There is an old Chinese saying: "It's good to be at home for a thousand days, but it's difficult to take even one step outside the door." This kind of unambitious and demoralizing thought is certainly unacceptable in today's "One World" era. However, seeing the current state of domestic transportation, it is impossible not to feel discouraged!</p>
<p>Without going into distant matters, considering the situation on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, almost everyone who has experienced buying tickets and traveling on these lines has major complaints. These two railways used to be the most well-managed transportation organizations. Why are they now in such a terrible state? Did China degenerate and become incompetent after eight years of resistance against Japan?</p>
<p>Looking at the deeper reasons, it still involves the fundamental issues of the entire country. While it is true that the management authorities are not without fault, they are also complaining. They will present a series of figures to prove that the actual difficulty lies in the shortage of vehicles and the large number of passengers. For example, before the war, there were more than 4,000 freight cars, but now there are only over 2,000, and more than 800 of them have been borrowed by the Jinpu Railway. Before the war, there were 370 passenger cars, but now there are only 242. Before the war, there were 161 locomotives, but now there are only 93. As for passengers, statistics show that there were about 12,000 people per day before the war, but now there are 30,000 to 40,000.</p>
<p>The road administration authorities' reasons also have undeniable factual basis. The phenomenon of crowded passengers also includes a serious livelihood issue – the activity of "small-scale traders." Taking the Beijing-Shanghai Railway as an example, some commodity prices in Nanjing are much cheaper than in Shanghai. Pork there costs only over 1,000 yuan per catty, while in Shanghai it sells for over 3,000 yuan. With a single transaction, one can earn more than double the profit, and the cost of a train ticket for a mixed train fourth class is only over 1,000 yuan, and for a special express train third class is no more than 4,400 yuan. Therefore, many small-scale traders bring fresh pork to Shanghai for sale in large baskets and small bundles, and some also bring eggs and fresh fish. We often see short-clothed people lying on the floor in the North Station building at night, most of whom are waiting to buy tickets early in the morning to make a living. From the perspective of maintaining order and cleanliness, it seems necessary to ban them, but from another perspective, we cannot bear to cut off the livelihoods of so many people!</p>
<p>The regulations on the opening hours of ticket windows and the long queues when purchasing tickets are also a central point of criticism from passengers. However, the railway bureau explains that this is to prevent the rampant scalping of tickets, although the buying and selling of scalped tickets has not disappeared to this day. A third-class ticket costing over 4,000 yuan sometimes sells for over 10,000 yuan on the black market. In addition to all these phenomena that seem difficult to completely improve, the road administration authorities should at least and necessarily conduct strict supervision of the efficiency of the ticket office staff at all times.</p>
<p>According to responsible personnel, the sleepers on the two railways were laid by the British in 1902 and have been in use for more than 40 years. Due to long-term use and damage during the war, many of them have rotted and been damaged, which has affected the current train speed. Recently, the bureau has started a restoration plan to replace 400,000 sleepers, which is expected to be completed in February next year. At that time, the express train between Beijing and Shanghai will be able to arrive in four and a half hours, and the number of daily train services can also be greatly increased, which can greatly improve the transportation of passengers.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra: Holding a Special Concert</h3>

The court hearing was adjourned for further hearing. It is noted that the original principal of Shanghai Women's Middle School was Wu Zhiqian, who was murdered by traitors at the school on September 4th of the 28th year, and was succeeded by his younger brother, Wu Yizhi, until now.</p>

<h3>Social Services: Responding to Readers</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Wartime Wife</p>
<p>Chen Yi asks: A friend of mine fled to the rear during the early stages of the war and lost contact for five years. He remarried in the rear and had children. Now he has returned to his hometown and discovered that his original wife (married before the war) is still alive, and his new wife has also come to his hometown. Now my friend intends to divorce his original wife. What path should he take? (1) Is it legal for the man to file for divorce with the court on the grounds that he had been separated for many years and her whereabouts were unknown? (2) Is it feasible to disregard her and only give her a considerable living allowance to make her leave? (3) If the original wife files a lawsuit, does it constitute bigamy? (4) There seem to be many cases like this. Has the legislative authority recently enacted any appropriate new laws to deal with such marital problems? (5) Can the original wife's children request a judgment that they be taken away by the woman? (6) If the woman makes harsh financial demands that the man (a civil servant) cannot afford, can the court be requested to reduce them?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] (1) During the War of Resistance, postal services and transportation between the occupied areas and the free areas were never interrupted. It is not difficult to find out whether the original wife's whereabouts were unknown. Therefore, using this as a reason for remarriage is not sufficient. (2) It must be with the consent of the original wife, otherwise it is not permissible. (3) He should be held responsible for bigamy. (4) Recently, no new laws have been promulgated regarding the resolution of such marital disputes. (5) After a divorce, the support of children is legally the responsibility of the husband, but if there is another agreement, it shall be followed. (6) In this case, the woman is not at fault and should be given a considerable maintenance allowance according to law, until the woman dies or marries someone else.</p>
<p>(2) Elopement with Another Man</p>
<p>Zhang Chengye asks: A woman, A, could not bear her husband, B's, abuse, so she fell in love with her neighbor, C (unmarried). Subsequently, A (age 22 at the time) eloped with C to Shanghai and lived together. It has been twelve years, and they have had three sons and two daughters. Nine years ago, B's mother came to Shanghai. Through mediation, C gave B a subsidy of one hundred yuan, and B's mother signed the divorce certificate on behalf of B. Now the certificate has been lost. Please advise: (1) Is the certificate valid if signed by B's mother on his behalf? (2) Is C guilty of seduction by cohabitating with A? (3) If this crime is constituted, how should it be punished? (4) Can a newspaper announcement declaring the certificate lost be used as evidence? (5) Can A request a divorce in court?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] (1) Invalid. (2) Crime of disrupting a family. (3) Imprisonment for up to three years. (4) The certificate is fundamentally invalid, and whether it is lost or not is irrelevant, but it can also be announced in the newspaper for future reference. (5) Requesting is permissible, but whether it can achieve the goal is a matter of judicial discretion.</p>
<h3>Changfeng Shorthand School Alumni Serve the Community</h3>
<p>Willing to Voluntarily Undertake Conference Recording</p>
<p>Editor: We have noticed that the recording methods used in lectures, symposiums, and shareholder meetings held by various sectors are still based on abbreviated Chinese characters. This inevitably leads to many omissions, often losing the true value, which is regrettable! We have been studying "Changfeng Shorthand Technique" for many years, using the latest leaf-shaped system, which is extremely fast and can accurately record the speaker's original words in detail, obtaining a perfect record manuscript. In the past, we have provided shorthand services for the Secondary Vocational Education Society, Dasheng Yarn Factory, and the Shanghai Machine Factory Federation, among others, and have received unanimous praise.</p>
<p>Now, on the one hand, to serve the community, and on the other hand, to promote shorthand, we are launching "Volunteer Recording." Whenever various agencies, social groups, companies, and schools hold symposiums, lectures, and shareholder meetings and need shorthand services, we are willing to solve the difficulties in recording and contribute a perfect record manuscript. "Volunteer Recording" contact: "Changfeng Shorthand School, No. 212 Ninghai West Road, this city." This matter concerns the promotion of culture, and we respectfully request your newspaper to publish it! Wishing you peace, Changfeng Shorthand School Alumni Association.</p>

<h3>Cotton Cloth Standards Approved: Cost Re-examined Based on Yarn Prices: Wholesale Profit Set at 12% Above Factory Price</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the Social Bureau convened the second meeting of the Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee. Attendees included Director Gu of the Social Bureau, Zhao Gongxin of the Municipal Council, Chen Jiazhen of the Textile Construction Company, Chang Guangdi and Wu Shuying of the Sixth District Textile Guild, Zhu Shangyi of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Bu Boxun and Lu Runjin of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry, and Huang Jiufeng and Bei Zairong of the Cotton Cloth Industry. Director Gu presided over the meeting and reported Mayor Wu's determination to stabilize yarn and cloth prices, as well as the significant mission undertaken by the committee. The mission of the committee is (1) to review reasonable prices and (2) to eliminate the black market. At the same time, the regulations passed in the previous session should still be referred to as regulations, and the members of each unit should be determined to facilitate the convening of meetings at any time.</p>
<p>When reviewing prices, Huang Jiufeng of the cotton cloth industry suggested that the standards for reviewing cotton cloth prices should be based on popular, widely sold goods. According to the current sales situation, the standards should be (1) 12-pound fine twill, (2) 12-pound white plain fine cloth, (3) No. 190 mercerized Shilin, and (4) Yuan Piji. There were no objections. Regarding prices, Huang Jiufeng reported the market prices before and after the foreign exchange adjustment. (1) 12-pound fine twill was 54,000 yuan before the exchange rate adjustment, with a maximum of 90,000 yuan, and the current market price is 80,000 to 82,000 yuan. (2) 12-pound fine cloth was 56,000 yuan before the exchange rate adjustment, with a maximum of 107,000 yuan, and the recent price is 78,000 to 80,000 yuan. No. 190 mercerized Shilin was 92,000 yuan before the adjustment, with a maximum of 150,000 yuan, and the recent price is 135,000 yuan. Thread Piji was 70,000 yuan before the adjustment, with a maximum of 120,000 yuan, and the current market price is 102,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Next, Bu Boxun, a representative of the dyeing and weaving industry, said that according to the current cost of the above four types of cloth, the actual cost of 12-pound fine cloth is at least 88,380 yuan, 12-pound fine twill is 80,000 yuan, No. 190 mercerized Shilin is 151,000 yuan, and Piji is 116,000 yuan. The market prices reported by the representatives of the cloth industry are not enough to cover the cost.</p>
<p>Director Gu said that the market prices and costs stated by the representatives of the cotton cloth and dyeing and weaving industries are very accurate. However, for the sake of reasonably suppressing cloth prices, it is necessary to carefully discuss and decide. He then entrusted the dyeing and weaving industry to formulate a detailed report based on the yarn prices determined by the Textile Control Committee, detailing the cost, factory payment, and legal profits, and submit it to the Social Bureau. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Council will then jointly investigate and verify the report before discussing it again at the next meeting. The attending representatives of the cotton cloth and dyeing and weaving industries jointly proposed that the cotton cloth market price should be flexible and determined separately according to the level of raw materials. Zhu Shangyi of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce said that the regulation of cotton cloth prices should include not only raw materials, but also other labor, taxes, and profits in the calculation to be reasonable.</p>
<p>Then, the profit of cotton cloth wholesalers was discussed, and it was unanimously decided that the wholesale price should be 12% above the factory price. Finally, Director Gu stated that now that there are general regulations on the factory price and wholesale price of cotton cloth, strict regulations on punishment should be imposed if manufacturers and wholesalers manipulate or raise prices in the future.</p>
<p>Wu Shuying, the representative of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Guild, believed that the cotton cloth market price is lower than the cost, and factories are selling at a loss. She still disagreed with the disposal item. However, the representatives said that Mayor Wu is determined to stabilize yarn and cloth prices, and they should unanimously support the price stabilization policy.</p>
<h3>Technical Issues in Yarn Allocation: Textile Control Committee Holds Symposium: Classification, Allocation Numbers, and Payment Awaiting Further Discussion: Yarn Dealers Also Need to Submit Reports for Allocation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Textile Industry Management Committee convened a symposium at the Textile Construction Conference Room, No. 130 Hankou Road, at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, bringing together the dyeing and weaving, knitting, underwear, towel, blanket, handkerchief, handmade cotton weaving, and yarn and cloth industries. The technical issues in the implementation of cotton yarn allocation were discussed. Deputy Director Li Shengbo and Director Liu Wenteng presided over the meeting. Mr. Li announced that Director Wu, who is also the chairman of the committee, had allocated 12,004 and a half pieces of yarn to the yarn factories, based on the standard of 1.75 million yuan per piece for 20-count yarn. Starting this Saturday, the yarn will be allocated to the various cotton product manufacturing industries over 15 days. Each guild will calculate the amount needed based on the previously reported needs, discounted by 60%, and allocate half of the amount first, as follows:</p>
<p>Dyeing and weaving industry: 7,816 and a half pieces</p>
<p>Knitting industry: 1,902 pieces</p>
<p>Underwear industry: 1,015 pieces</p>
<p>Towel and blanket industry: 720 and a half pieces</p>
<p>Handmade cotton weaving: 460 and a half pieces</p>
<p>Handkerchief industry: 90 pieces</p>
<p>As for the manufacturing industries that have not submitted reports, such as the canvas industry, and the members of each guild who have not participated in the application, they are limited to truthfully submitting reports within these 15 days and will participate in the allocation next time. Director Liu also stated that (1) the members of each guild must accurately report their production equipment, yarn usage, and yarn inventory. (2) This yarn allocation must focus on practical use. Each guild is responsible for reporting its allocation, production, and sales situation after the allocation. (3) The actual situation of each factory that has submitted a report for allocation may not match. Each guild is responsible for continuing to strictly investigate. If the application is excessive, it should be substantially reduced. Subsequently, representatives from various industries expressed their support for the policy of the主管authorities and felt the significance and difficulty of their responsibilities. They hoped to work together under the leadership of the Textile Control Committee. Finally, Pan Shihao, Xu Zhaohou, Li Daofa, Ren Jiandao, and others were nominated to meet with the responsible personnel of the Textile Construction Business Office and the organizers of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Guild this morning to discuss the classification of goods and the detailed procedures for reviewing the allocation standards, payment, and delivery. Mr. Li stated to the yarn dealers that in addition to the yarn used by the above six manufacturing industries in this city, a survey report must also be submitted for review and allocation, and the yarn dealers will handle it. He also said that the restrictions on yarn going to South China will soon be lifted. It is heard that the above six manufacturing industries are scheduled to meet at the Dyeing and Weaving Guild this morning to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Unable to Rise</h3>
<p>It is also rumored that "Index-Linked Redemption" is said to have large accounts settling at the 78th floor. However, with the revival of the "Index-Linked Redemption" theory, there are also new buyers, and slightly more people are short covering at lower prices. The market is still mediocre. The Unified C opened at 2,200 yuan in the morning and was immediately surrounded by sellers, gradually falling to 2,010 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, it closed slightly lower by 20 yuan compared to the previous day. The same was true for Unified A and B. Unified D was slightly lower by 50 yuan, and Unified E fell by 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Limited Allocation of Rayon: Market Prices Remain at Original Levels: Allocation Based on Actual Needs to Begin Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the Government Material Supply Committee, sold rayon as usual yesterday, allocating a total of 119 and a half cases to various silk weaving factories. The allocation price for No. 120 Tianqiao Youguang was 2.8 million yuan per case. The price for the same number of miscellaneous brands was 2.75 million yuan per case. However, the quantity was extremely small, so most of the silk factories did not receive any, and those who did only received five to ten or so bales at most. It is said that starting next month, allocation will be implemented based on actual needs, four times a month.</p>
<p>In addition, the Textile Construction Company also sold rayon yesterday, totaling 172 cases. Among them, weaving tape factories accounted for 51 cases, and rayon merchants accounted for 121 cases. The allocation price for No. 120 miscellaneous brands Youguang and Banguang was 2.75 million yuan per case. No. 75 JINJI Banguang was 2.38 million yuan per case. No. 150 miscellaneous brands Youguang was 2.59 million yuan per case. Therefore, although the shouted prices in the rayon market yesterday remained at the original levels, not a single case was traded. Factory management was stable with a slight sense of fatigue. The transaction price for Grade D yesterday was 50,000 to 100,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Grade E had few transactions, and ordinary goods and Gan Jing were still shouting at the original prices of the previous day, with rare transactions. Silk goods and quilt covers were down another 50,000 yuan yesterday, and there were still no buyers. There were no changes in other goods.</p>
<h3>Money Supply Eases, Buying Sentiment Strong: Both Gold and Paper Money Recover Well</h3>
<p>Raw gold still rose slightly yesterday, opening around 2.235 million in the morning. Sentiment was quite good, and powerful players were taking in. From 2.232 million, it gradually rose. After 10:00 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 130 bars at a price of 2.2425 million. After that, the money supply was still loose and abundant. Near noon, demand still exceeded supply, rising to 2.25 million before stabilizing slightly. At noon, it hovered around 2.245 million. In the afternoon, it continued to be slightly stable, and the next-day settlement was stationed at around 2.25 million. As a result, it closed 15,000 higher than the previous close. Ornament gold rose to 2.38 million. Pattern silver and plain silver dollars continued to be low. Underground short-term financing was even looser, with interest rates ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were stable with few changes. The retail price of the U.S. dollar was still 3,500 yuan, with demand. In the underground market, it was between 4,100 yuan and 4,150 yuan, slightly higher than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars remained stable due to the fact that both the spot and term rates in the Hong Kong market had been hovering for several days, hovering around 880 yuan, with little change compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was also stationed around 880 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,070 yuan with supply. The British exchange rate was around 14,100 yuan, with very few transactions. The listed price of the U.S. exchange rate was still flat.</p>
<h3>Business Firms Prohibited from Accepting Deposits</h3>
<p>Those Who Do Not Rely on Deposits for Lending Are Not Subject to Prohibition</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Ministry of Finance recently issued a document to various regions, clarifying the regulation in the "Measures for Managing Banks" that "those who accept deposits without calling themselves banks are regarded as banks." That is, ordinary business firms should be absolutely prohibited from accepting deposits. However, those who handle fund transfers, remittances, or handle bill discounting and lend money to relevant parties for the purpose of using funds, and do not rely on absorbing deposits for lending, are not subject to prohibition. However, they still need to have a legitimate document for a certain business activity to prove it.</p>
<h3>Fellow Traders Eager to Sell Off: Yarn Market Turns Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly turned downward. Reports indicated that the combined distribution of the Liaoning Cooperative was only slightly over 24,000 units per month. Many factories still reportedly sold excess yarn freely. Investigations revealed that private factories accounted for two-thirds of the quota, only 16,000 units. However, the total production of private factories was more than five times this amount. It was easily deduced that a large portion of yarn from private factories would still flood the market, inevitably leading to a significant increase in the supply of actual goods. Consequently, market sentiment turned pessimistic, and fellow traders eagerly competed to sell off their holdings. 20-count yarns of various brands fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Fine yarns initially rose but ultimately stabilized, resulting in no significant changes from yesterday.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Hankou Cotton</h3>
<p>The Association Finds It Inconvenient to Handle Uniformly; Members Will Negotiate Individually</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau previously proposed a plan to purchase Hankou cotton, seeking the consent of the Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District. The Association's board of directors has now decided that each member will negotiate with the Central Trust Bureau individually, rather than having the Association handle it uniformly. A member of the Association stated that there were two reasons for this decision: (1) The required cotton quality varied among factories, making it inconvenient to handle uniformly; (2) There were theoretical issues. Regarding the quality of domestic cotton, it was stated that among the Shaanxi cotton, American Upland cotton could be spun into 32-count yarn, while local cotton could be spun into 20-count or higher yarn; the American Upland cotton from Central China could be spun into approximately 30-count yarn, while local cotton could be spun into less than 20-count yarn. Currently, the city's need is for fine yarn of 30 counts or higher; coarse yarn can only be woven into coarse cloth, which is sold in rural areas.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Foreign Paper Arrives</h3>
<p>The "Hai Sui Te" (海歲特) of the Tianxiang Foreign Firm, arriving from Norway the day before yesterday, brought 2,500 wooden crates of paper, 12,270 rolls of newspaper, and various types of foreign paper. It is currently docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf for unloading. Furthermore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Zhixin" (執信) ship arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday, carrying 3,500 bags of refined salt, reported by the Jiuda Refined Salt Company.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Weak and Unable to Rise; Trading Volume Sharp Decline; Speculation Rife that Spot Transactions Will Be Implemented Next Week; Sentiment Agitated, with a Slight Increase in Buying Interest Near Closing</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were slightly stable when trading opened yesterday. Off-market speculative capital seemed to be participating, but with limited capacity, the market turned weak again shortly after a small initial rise. Trading volume decreased after 10:00 AM, and market conditions were worryingly bleak. As a result, brokers were facing an unfavorable situation. Number 176 closed out Yongxin Yarn and bought Xinhao, causing the market to feel even more cautious and weak. Number 233 closed out a large volume of Yongxin Yarn, forced down to within 730 yuan. By 11:30 AM, the market was in a tug-of-war. Due to limited buying interest, most transactions closed at low prices. Compared to the previous closing prices, popular stocks such as Yongxin Yarn, Xinhao, Jingfu, and Qinxin declined slightly, while Meiya and Xinguang fell by 3-4%. Cold stocks such as Datong rose slightly, while Tongyi and Xinya Underwear remained flat. The remaining stocks declined slightly. The afternoon was stable with little change, with limited ups and downs, and the market continued to hover. Near the closing, there was widespread speculation that spot transactions would be implemented on Monday of next week, leading to a slight increase in buying interest. However, due to limited time, the closing prices differed slightly from the final transaction prices. Overall, compared to the previous closing prices, popular stocks such as Yongxin Yarn, Xinhao, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxin all declined slightly. Cold stocks such as Zhongfang, Huafeng, and Match Company declined slightly, while Datong, Zhongsih, and Rongfeng rose slightly. Xinya, Tongyi, Cement, and Liann remained flat. Jinglun and Wuhe each fell by about half a percent. The total trading volume was 6.82 million shares. Price fluctuations for various stocks off-market were minimal.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were stable, hovering without much movement. However, the situation still felt unsustainable. Compared to the previous closing prices, Yeguang rose slightly, while Yisha, British American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson, Paper Industry, Steel Industry, and Asia declined slightly. Jardine Brewery remained flat.</p>
<h3>Four Associations Discuss Industrial and Mining Loan Measures; Machinery and Raw Materials Allowed as Collateral; Real Estate and Other Immovable Properties Excluded</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 4:00 PM, 24th] The Shanghai Office of the Four Associations is handling industrial and mining loans, originally intending to assist with working capital. The regulations stipulated that raw materials and finished products would be used as collateral. However, the office has recently received repeated requests from industrial and commercial groups to broaden the scope of collateral to include real estate and machinery. After detailed study, the office decided that if raw materials and finished products were insufficient as collateral, machinery that had been put into operation, or had plans to begin operation, and met manufacturing standards approved by the head office, could be used as collateral for the insufficient portion. However, real estate and other immovable properties were not allowed as collateral. The industrial and mining loan measures are listed below:</p>
<p>1.  Industrial and mining loans will use raw materials, materials, finished products, and semi-finished products as collateral. The discount rate will be determined by the head office and branch offices at any time, based on market conditions and the nature of the collateral.</p>
<p>2.  If the collateral in the previous article is insufficient, machinery that has been put into operation, or has plans to begin operation, and meets manufacturing standards approved by the head office, may be used as partial collateral. The proportion shall be limited to a maximum of 50%. The discount rates are as follows:</p>
<p>A. New machinery, with an age of three years or less, will be collateralized at 50% of the current new price.</p>
<p>B. Existing machinery, with a working age of ten years or less, will be collateralized at 40% of the assessed value.</p>
<p>C. Existing machinery, with a working age of twenty years or more, will be collateralized at 30% of the assessed value.</p>
<p>3.  Real estate and other immovable properties shall not be used as collateral under any circumstances.</p>
<h3>High Commodity Prices and Heavy Interest Rates: Coal Market Trading is Sparse</h3>
<p>The coal market is experiencing sparse trading in white coal. Traders are hesitant to buy due to high commodity prices and heavy interest rates, thus they are limited to actual sales volume. Sellers, on the other hand, are maintaining high prices due to the scarcity of goods. As a result, the market is in a hovering situation with little change. Previously, the market price of bituminous coal lumps was much higher than the price allocated by the Fuel Commission due to shortages. Recently, the supply of spot goods has become looser, so factories are directly purchasing from the Fuel Commission. Sales for coal merchants are gradually cooling, and the market is extremely weak.</p>
<h3>Ban on Wheat Exports: Market Prices Plunge Yesterday; Rice Prices Also Decline Slightly</h3>
<p>Rice arrivals are continuous, with over 10,000 stones registered for both customers and goods, but digestion remains sluggish. The market is steadily declining. Southern and Northern japonica rice are successively down by over 1,000 yuan. "Yangxian" (羊秈) and "Buxian" (埠秈) rice are still acceptable, but medium and lower grades are also down by 1,000 yuan. "Duxian" (杜秈) and "Kexian" (客秈) rice are down by another 1,000 yuan. "Baiyuan" (白元) rice is gradually declining by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan with limited transactions. "Yinyuan" (陰元) rice is down by another 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. The oil market is digesting well, with raw oil remaining popular. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil are flat, while sesame oil remains unchanged. The Shantou yellow soybean market is closed, causing fatigue from accumulated work. Yellow soybeans are up slightly by 1,000 yuan. Sesame seeds are doing well. Red sorghum is similar. Tea beans are sluggish, and red beans are down by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are trading slightly in high-quality goods, with buyers in other locations picking up high-priced goods, causing a rebound of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Peanut sales are sluggish, down by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Arrivals of red beans are mostly scattered, and buyers are also sluggish, continuing to fall by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean cakes are also weak, down by 100 to 200 yuan. Wheat bran is firm. Due to the ban on wheat exports, digestion is stagnant, and prices have plunged by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, with a lack of formal transactions.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Price Limits Increased: Rapeseed Oil Up by 8%</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs invited representatives from oil and grain industries, oil tillage industry associations, private oil mills, China Vegetable Oil Factory, and China Edible Oil Company to convene a review meeting to readjust edible oil prices as follows: Qingdao raw oil, 98,000 yuan; soybean oil, 98,000 yuan; rapeseed oil, 93,000 yuan; raw sesame oil, 92,000 yuan. Except for raw sesame oil, which was not previously included in the price limits, the above three types are added for the first time. Based on proportional calculations, rapeseed oil has the highest price increase, accounting for 8%, soybean oil accounts for 5%, and raw oil has the least, only about 1-2%. Yesterday, the prices of all goods in the market did not exceed the new price limits. Zhongzhi and Zhongshi continue to maintain a daily joint distribution of 200 barrels of edible oil, totaling 700 dan. Private factories such as Dade Xin and Dayou Yu also put over 1,400 dan of edible oil on the market. It is understood that if not affected by power supply, private factories can produce 20,000 dan per month, Zhongzhi 10,000 dan, and Zhongshi regularly imports 10,000 dan from Qingdao, which is more than sufficient to meet the city's needs. If restricted by electricity, production may be reduced by half. This price adjustment will undoubtedly benefit various manufacturers in maintaining costs.</p>
<h3>Financial Panic in Wuhan: Executive Headquarters Seeks Rescue Measures</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hankou, 24th] The financial market here is undergoing constant changes. According to reports, the number of businesses and money houses that have collapsed has reached 117. To rescue the recent crisis, the Wuhan Executive Headquarters convened a symposium with the financial sector and relevant agencies yesterday, deciding on the following: (A) Investigate the actual situation of the collapsed businesses and strictly deal with any cases of fraud; (B) Establish an economic research group to determine measures for maintaining financial stability in detail; (C) Resolutely support the 58 legally registered money houses and crack down on underground money houses; (D) Consult the Ministry of Finance to consider establishing a joint reserve bank.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Purchase Price: Both Sides Have Not Reached an Agreement; Another Meeting Will Be Held Today to Decide</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Representatives from the Central Trust Bureau, China Silk Corporation, Commodity Inspection Bureau, and Central Bank will hold a meeting at 2:00 PM today to continue discussing the raw silk purchase price issue. Yesterday, the China Silk Corporation and Central Trust Bureau convened a discussion meeting with representatives from silk factories and silk merchants, informally exchanging opinions, involving the difficulties of silk merchants and general import/export issues. In general, the Central Trust Bureau's position is based on a financial perspective, believing that the government subsidies are already high based on the previously agreed price, and the merchants' demands are excessive. The China Silk Corporation, standing from the perspective of producers, believes that the purchase price of raw silk should be determined by referring to the situations in other countries and the production costs in China, so that the national treasury is not burdened too heavily, and silk merchants can also prosper.</p>
<h3>Import Statistics for September: Imports Four Times Exports, Cotton Leads; Oils, Waxes, Bristles, and Hides Are Major Exports</h3>

<h3>Mei Yibao Returns to China</h3>
<p>After Lecturing in the United States for a Year and a Half</p>
<p>Mei Yibao, a professor of philosophy at Yenching University in Beiping, recently returned to China from the United States. Professor Mei went to the United States to lecture at the invitation of the US State Department, lasting nearly a year and a half.

<h3>Wude Agricultural and Industrial Vocational School Plans to Relocate from Lishui to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>When the current Shanghai Garrison Commander, Xuan Tiewu, was the director of the Zhejiang Security Department during the war of resistance, he established the Wude Agricultural and Industrial Vocational School in Lishui, southern Zhejiang, in view of the fact that the children of the martyrs who died fighting against the enemy and bandits were displaced and deprived of education. At that time, the school accommodated 200 children of the martyrs, providing them with education and technical skills. After operating for two years, the school achieved excellent results and was approved for registration by the Zhejiang Education Department. Currently, due to inconvenient transportation in that location, it is planned to relocate to the outskirts of Hangzhou, with Chongfu Temple in Liangzhu along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway as the new site. The estimated cost of construction, equipment, and relocation is approximately 200 million yuan, which the school is finding difficult to raise independently. It is reported that the school负责人 has submitted a request to the central government for a subsidy of 100 million yuan in order to complete the relocation plan.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Recently Formulated Two Principles for National Schools and Academic Institutions to Hire Foreign Personnel</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The Ministry of Education has recently formulated two principles for national schools and academic research institutions to hire foreign personnel: (1) The school will hire the personnel independently, and the school will bear the cost of the treatment. The hiring procedure can be completed by the school hiring the personnel and reporting to the Ministry for record purposes. (2) If the personnel to be hired require the Ministry to bear the cost of the treatment, the hiring personnel should report to the Ministry for approval after being hired by the school. As for the treatment of foreign personnel hired, in addition to those handled by the school itself, the Ministry also considers their situation in China, their living needs, and all the needs of their families living in their home country or their families who come to China with them, carefully considering the amount to be approved, so that their lives in China are not lower than their lives in their home country, and they can have a slight surplus. As for the detailed measures, the Department of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education is discussing them with the Counsellor's Office.</p>
<h3>Guozhen Cup Volleyball Semifinals: You Team and Huayan Team Victorious Yesterday; You Team Wins Against Dongqing, Huayan Wins Against Renyu; Finals Will Be Held Tomorrow Night Against Youlian and Soviet Teams</h3>

They will respectively compete against Youlian and the Soviet team tomorrow night for the championship.</p>
<p>In the women's group, You Team and Dongqing first competed. Dongqing ultimately demonstrated less experience, making it difficult to achieve anything. You Team thus consistently led, winning the first set 21 to 12. In the second set, You Team found even greater success, with Dongqing losing again 7 to 21. In the final set, You Team easily won, 21 to 6. Concluding the match, You Team easily defeated Dongqing in three straight sets.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the men's group took the stage, with league champion Huayan facing Renyu in the semifinals. The Huayan players greatly demonstrated their abilities, while Renyu's efforts to resist were ineffective, losing the first set 8 to 21. In the second set, Huayan led from start to finish, and Renyu still showed no improvement. As a result, Huayan won another set 21 to 9. In the final set, Renyu performed better, with the score being close, but ultimately they could not surpass Huayan, with the score being 21 to 18. Huayan won again, and the overall result was that Huayan defeated Renyu three sets to zero.</p>
<h3>Zheng Lun Team Arrives in Beijing</h3>

<h3>Mayor's Cup Small Ball Redecision; Championship Still Undecided</h3>
<p>Longjie and Jianxing Recreate a Draw</p>
<p>The Mayor's Cup small ball final was played for the second time yesterday at Jinyuan Park. Jianxing and Longjie were still unable to gain an advantage. Although the game was extended for 20 minutes to determine the winner, the result remained a scoreless draw, ending 0-0. The Mayor's Cup championship thus remains undecided, and a third rematch will be scheduled.</p>
<p>Yesterday's game drew a large crowd. Mayor Wu specially sent Wang Guanqing as a representative to present awards. In the first half, Longjie's offense was very strong, with Jianxing's Luo Jiefu saving multiple dangerous shots. In the second half, Jianxing suddenly became active, with Chen Mingzhe charging straight towards the goal, which could have easily resulted in a score. However, he acted too hastily and hit the ball too high, to the disappointment of the spectators. At the end of regulation time, neither team had scored, so the game was extended for 20 minutes, and the situation became even more intense. The result was still a pair of goose eggs, resulting in another draw.</p>
<p>Jianxing: Tao Ziming, Shen Jinda, Xu Guofu, Tao Jianfu, Chen Mingzhe, Gu Yiche, Luo Shoufu.</p>
<p>Longjie: Sheng Peter, Zhou Yongfang, Yu Zhenyue, Gao Xiuqing, Zhao Yongfang, Gu Dirong, Lin Shaojun (replaced by Yu Musen).</p>

<p>Civil Affairs Briefs</p>
<h3>People Applying for ID Cards Should Be Forwarded Immediately; No Delay Allowed; Civil Affairs Bureau Reissues Letter to Each District for Diligent Handling</h3>
<p>Seventeen citizens in the First District applied for national identification cards. After one month, the Bao office has not yet forwarded them. Staff from the Bao office claimed that they had to wait until all applications were collected before submitting them to the district. How this situation is to be handled has been submitted to the Civil Affairs Bureau for instructions. It is reported that after receiving the report, the Civil Affairs Bureau stated that (1) applications for national identification cards should be forwarded as soon as they are received, and there should be absolutely no delays; (2) during the period when each Bao cadre is handling household registration, if people have situations involving registration, removal, birth, death, marriage, divorce, recognition, adoption, migration, etc., the Jia chiefs should always urge each household to apply for various registrations, and nothing should be omitted. These stipulations have been repeatedly communicated and detailed in the 13th point of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Letter No. 229, issued on September 10. Now, each district Bao has not paid attention to the speed and accuracy of this work, which is very inappropriate. Yesterday, a circular was issued to each district office, urging them to diligently supervise their subordinates to handle this matter conscientiously.</p>
<h3>Three Additional Jia Added to the Sixteenth District</h3>
<p>The 18th Bao of the 16th District (Hongkou) has reported that due to long-term cultivation of land, the construction of shelters has increased the population sharply. It is proposed to add three Jia: the 26th, 27th, and 28th. Ji Zhengfeng, Huang Xiaogen, and Li Guosheng have been elected as the Jia chiefs of each Jia.

On the afternoon of the 22nd of this month, the district invited relevant agencies, including the police branch bureau cleaning squadron, the health branch office, and the district people's representatives, to discuss the implementation. The sanitation implementation measures were amended and passed, and five key items were decided.</p>
<h3>Tenth District Bao Cadre Symposium</h3>
<p>The 10th District (Jing'an) District Office held its tenth Bao cadre symposium on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. More than 40 people attended, chaired by Chief Executive Wu Jingshu. In addition to reviewing the results of the household registration verification work, instructions were also given on civil affairs and cultural work. The meeting adjourned at 5 o'clock. In addition, because the verification work has been in progress for many days, in order to make the household registration more perfect, the District Office has dispatched six assistants to various Bao to conduct random household checks, starting on the 22nd of this month, with a deadline of one week.</p>
<p>Adjustments to Bao and Jia Chiefs The 10th District Office recently adjusted the personnel of the Bao and Jia chiefs. Sun Yuan, the Bao chief of the 11th Bao, resigned because his own profession was busy and he could not take care of the position. His resignation was approved. Fang Yinbo and Lin Datao were appointed to act as Bao chief and deputy Bao chief respectively. Ni Yuzhong was appointed as the deputy Bao chief of the 35th Bao, Cai Xingzhang was appointed as the Jia chief of the 1st Jia of the 25th Bao, and Yang Tugen was appointed as the Jia chief of the 20th Jia of the 25th Bao.

<h3>Northern Jiangsu Situation Improves; People Still Fearful; Tears Everywhere</h3>
<p>— Zhenjiang, 14th. Special Correspondent Fang Canglang</p>
<p>Although the Communist army was defeated in the plains along the canal and retreated to the marsh areas of Xinghua and Dongtai in northern Jiangsu, hoping to make a final struggle, it is already like a trapped beast within the strong encirclement of the National Army. Their future fate is self-evident. What deserves our attention now is the series of problems left behind by the Communist army, the most important of which are the land reform policy, the reconstruction of basic-level administrative institutions, and the restoration of the rural economy. The people of northern Jiangsu are now watching the government's actions with a mixture of joy, fear, grief, and hope, and eagerly hope that the government will quickly come up with a wise solution to prove the cruelty and absurdity of the Chinese Communist Party with bloody facts, and reflect that the policies implemented by the National Government are indeed gentle, appropriate, and suitable for the needs of all Chinese people.</p>
<p>Fifty-Year-Old Woman with Bound Feet Killed by Remnant Bandits</p>
<p>After Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Baoying were successively recovered by the National Army, the people along the canal have seen the light of day again. However, because the National Army's advance was rapid, it was difficult to restore the communication between the city and the countryside in each county for a time. Therefore, in the vast rural areas beyond the points and lines on both sides of the canal, there are still a few remnant bandits who failed to escape, hiding in the countryside, waiting for an opportunity to make trouble. In the Luyang Lake area at the junction of Gaoyou and Jiangdu counties, remnant bandits killed innocent people who were unwilling to join the bandits on the 8th and 9th of this month to vent their anger. Their methods of killing innocent people were even more vicious than those of the Japanese invaders, often using hoes to behead innocent people. On the 9th of this month, the villagers in the area learned of the good news that the National Army had recovered Shaobo. The villagers ran to tell each other, but the remnant bandits discovered this. That night, more than 100 people were killed, even a woman with bound feet over the age of 50 was not spared. It is reported that when the eastward-窜 能 army returned to the small Jixiang area in Fanchuan, the number of people killed by the remnant bandits was also large.</p>
<p>Nothing is More Urgent Than Clearing the Countryside; Post-War Work is Busy</p>
<p>Now the National Army ××× Division stationed in Yangzhou has taken advantage of the victory to advance. General Liang Bo of the ×××× Brigade of the Gaobao Reorganization has personally led his troops to garrison in Yangzhou to assume the heavy responsibility of pacifying the local area. The order on the west bank of the canal has been improving day by day. After the east bank's remnant bandits were searched and suppressed by the capable troops of our ××× Division Huang department, the security of the countryside can also be guaranteed.</p>
<p>From the 9th of this month to the 15th of this month, it should be the day for the refugees who fled outside the canal to return to the city. From the 16th of this month to the end of this month, it is almost the day for the refugees in each county to return to the town. From next month, refugees from outside each county can safely return to their hometowns, resume their businesses, and return to farming. At present, in the post-war reconstruction work of each county along the canal, nothing is more urgent than clearing the countryside.</p>
<p>Quickly Research Land Policy to Seek a Reasonable Solution</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived in Yangzhou on the 12th of this month and interviewed gentlemen and local elders from various counties in northern Jiangsu to inquire about the post-war reconstruction issues in the counties in the recovered area of northern Jiangsu, the conclusions obtained were: First, quickly clear the countryside to pacify the people; second, reconstruct basic-level administrative institutions and carefully select personnel, refresh rural administration, and start anew with the people to prevent criticism; third, carefully handle the land issue, and quickly send senior, reputable, knowledgeable, and well-connected officials to the recovered area of northern Jiangsu to study the reasons for the failure of the land distribution policy implemented by the Communist Party in northern Jiangsu, and conduct on-the-spot surveys of the area and types of land in northern Jiangsu, the current situation of farmland water conservancy, the habits of landlords and their land income rent, and the lives of owner-farmers and tenant farmers, in order to prepare for the revision of the land policy when order is established, the country is unified, and the constitution is implemented.</p>
<p>The Policies Implemented by the Communist Party Violate the Father of the Nation's Teachings</p>
<p>Most people in northern Jiangsu (including landlords and those without land) expressed doubts about the proposals published in the Shanghai and Nanjing newspapers to implement a moderate land policy in the recovered area of northern Jiangsu. Some experienced people even criticized this as a fallacy by some planners who do not move their limbs, do not distinguish between the five grains, and speculate about land issues behind closed doors. They also said that advocating to retain or tamper with the land policy left behind by the Chinese Communist Party in northern Jiangsu is actually contrary to the teachings of the Father of the Nation, because the Father of the Nation's methods of equalizing land rights and controlling capital are clearly stated in the "Three Principles of the People" and can never be replaced by the Chinese Communist Party's cold and cruel land policy or the seemingly right but actually wrong moderate land policy advocated by some people. However, in addition, some local administrative authorities also agree that this is a major event worth studying and should be carefully considered. Whether a moderate land distribution policy can be implemented first in northern Jiangsu, where great chaos has just subsided, has been ravaged by war, and both landlords and tenant farmers have fled for their lives under the high-pressure policies of the Communist Party, they hope that experienced experts will first go to the rural areas of northern Jiangsu to conduct on-the-spot investigations, carefully study the matter, and come up with a reasonable solution.</p>
<h3>Zhou Fohai Publicly Tried in the Dacheng Hall; Old Accounts of the "Two-Faced Man" Settled for the First Time</h3>
<p>— Express Report from Nanjing and Beijing, 21st. Yang Yanbing</p>
<p>Unable to Withstand the Test of Artillery Fire; He Tore Off His Mask Himself</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai, a traitor, was one of the original five-member gang of the "Wang Regime." He successively served as the Secretary-General of the Pseudo Central Political Committee, the Pseudo National Government Commissioner, the Pseudo Vice President of the Executive Yuan, the Pseudo Minister of Finance, the Pseudo Mayor of Shanghai, and the Pseudo President of the Central Reserve Bank. Although his position in the pseudo-government was second only to the traitor Chen Gongbo, he formed his own faction, like a small overlord. His actions have harmed the country and his crimes are obvious. Therefore, the public trial of the traitor Zhou in the Dacheng Hall today can be called the climax of the capital's trial of traitors. Zhou Fohai is from Hunan. He studied at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan in his early years and made friends with insidious and cunning Japanese politicians. After returning to China, he worked as a professor at Lingnan University. During the Northern Expedition, he once served as the secretary of the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters. Later, he also served as the secretary-general and director of the political department of the Wuhan branch of the Central Military Academy. Soon after, he colluded with Wang Jingwei and engaged in treacherous activities.</p>
<p>When he was the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, the flames of the War of Resistance were spreading across the plains of the north and south of the Yangtze River. At that time, Zhou Fohai also hoarsely shouted "Resist Japan" in a hypocritical manner. However, unable to withstand the test of artillery fire, his germs of defeatism erupted in his body like malaria germs. He began to feel uneasy about the country, eloped with the traitor Wang to Hanoi, and even became an echo of the traitor's surrender. Later, they simply tore off their masks and began to engage in treasonous activities. This shameless behavior determined his fate.</p>
<p>Before 7:00 AM, the entrance of the High Court was crowded with citizens who wanted to attend the hearing. The traffic vehicle of the Capital Police Department went to Laohuqiao at around 6:00 AM. At this time, Zhou Fohai was getting up. Seeing the summons, he quickly put on the newly made gray cloth robe that his wife had sent the night before, and polished his single-shoe-style leather shoes. He said to the bailiff: "Sorry, please wait a moment while I have some breakfast." After speaking, he took out two butter breads, ate them, and then put the two books of ten lines of characters in a yellow leather bag, and put on a gray woolen hat, taking ten minutes. When Zhou Fohai walked out with the bailiff, the other traitors in the same prison, Ding Mocun and Luo Junqiang, said one after another: "Let's watch Lao Zhou first." After the bailiff handed Zhou Fohai over to the High Court's bailiff, the photo reporters took pictures. On the car, Zhou Fohai asked the Chief Zhu: "I'm afraid I'm wearing too many clothes. Can I take them off there?" The Chief replied: "Yes." Then he asked Zhou Fohai: "How is your food handled?" Zhou smiled and said: "It's all sent by my family." His words showed a sense of satisfaction. When the car passed Moshou Road, Chief Zhu said that he had arrived at Moshou Road, and Zhou Fohai actually asked: "Is it still called Moshou Road now?" When he passed the Bank of Communications at Xinjiekou, the Bank of Communications was the former site of the Pseudo Central Reserve Bank. Zhou Fohai stared at the building for a minute, as if with endless emotion.</p>

<p>Moved Out Grain Hidden by the Communist Army to Relieve Refugees</p>
<p>After the situation in northern Jiangsu improved, it greatly benefited Nanjing, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang economically. Shortly after the canal was opened, the food from Gaoyou and Baoying could be transported to Jiangnan to regulate food supply. After the army marched north, the National Army's military essence could also be supplied locally in northern Jiangsu. Therefore, the price of rice in Gaoyou has increased from 10,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan per stone. The autumn harvest this year in the canal and Lixiahe in northern Jiangsu is still good. Although the farmers fled due to the Communist army's oppression and there was insufficient manpower, the local food in the countryside is reportedly not very lacking. The public grain hidden by the Communist army in various places was cleared out and used to relieve refugees, which is a good thing. However, under the Communist Party's high-pressure deception and plunder policy, people were struggling to survive, and both materially and spiritually, they felt endless pain. Going north along the canal from Yangzhou, the residents along the coast, whether in urban or rural areas, and regardless of age, mostly had a pale complexion and were haggard. An old man from a rural area in Gaoyou told the reporter: "Fortunately, the National Army recovered Gaoyou on the 8th of this month. If it had been three days later, all the old men with beards in the county would have been lost because the Communist Party's target of struggle in Gaobao counties had only one 'beard' left." After the beginning of this month, the Communist Party's political workers in Gaoyou shouted the slogan of cleaning up the 鬍子 and struggled against the beards. When the old man said this, his voice trembled.</p>

<h3>Zhou Traitor Looked Up and Not Down; Tripped on the Big Stone Steps</h3>
<p>When arriving at the High Court at 8:30, the High Court was already crowded. Zhou Traitor was the second to last to get out of the car, and the citizens scrambled to watch. Zhou Traitor seemed ashamed under the glaring eyes of the crowd. After 10 o'clock, Judge Zhao Chen led the jurors and prosecutors to the court. Zhou Traitor was escorted by four bailiffs and walked out of the waiting room. Zhou Traitor strode high and seemed fearless. But at this time, perhaps because he looked up and not down, he actually tripped on the stone steps. Zhou Traitor walked into the courtroom, stepping onto the dock of the accused. Perhaps the mercury lamps and the tens of thousands of onlookers had taken away his soul. His fat and stiff cheeks and whiskers kept twitching, and his body was also trembling slightly.</p>
<p>Photo reporters began to work busily, magnesium lights illuminated, and the sound of cameras clicked. In the sea of people where movement was difficult, they ran with difficulty. "Fight for the best shot" was their responsibility. Under the dazzling light of the magnesium lamp, Zhou Traitor lowered his proud head, and his face began to flush. On the stage, the prosecutor solemnly stated the main points of the indictment, and the noisy voices of the people drowned out these beautiful and majestic words. Zhou Traitor stretched his head and kept scratching his newly shaved head.</p>
<p>"After the July 7 Incident, the government repeatedly declared its determination to fully resist Japan, and would never stop until the final victory. You are the perennial Minister of Propaganda, you must know this." The judge asked sternly. Zhou Traitor smiled slyly. After a thought, he created a set of novel defenses, saying that although he should bear the responsibility of a traitor in law, but politically, because of the bad political and international situation at that time, he "formed his own" and had a new view.</p>
<h3>Zhou Traitor Confessed; Even if the Law Does Not Sanction, He Feels Uneasy in His Conscience</h3>
<p>Zhou Traitor was after all clever. Speaking of this, seeing the color on the court was not right, he knew that the previous propaganda had not achieved the desired effect. So he frowned, quickly turned his head, and put on an artificial tone of regret, he hurriedly said: "Everything was due to the unclear judgment at the time. As soon as I arrived in Nanjing, I knew that I had completely made a mistake." He said: "Secretly leaving Chongqing, even if the law does not sanction it, I feel very uneasy in my conscience. On the contrary, in the five years in Nanjing, even if the law sanctions it, I don't feel any guilt in my conscience." Obviously, Zhou Traitor is a dualist of facts (such as the political situation he said) and law. In his opinion, when the time comes, the law can be thrown to the winds.</p>
<h3>A Strange Clique: The Low-Key Club</h3>
<p>Next, Zhou, the traitor, explained to the reporters a specialized term he had pondered for many years – the Low-Key Club. He said: Before the War of Resistance, this was merely a private friendship group without any formal organization. At that time, anyone who frequented his home, such as Mei Siping, Gao Zongwu, and others, felt that defeat in the war against Japan was inevitable. Therefore, they derided those who strongly advocated resistance as "talking high." One day, Dr. Hu Shih, during a conversation at his home, casually proposed this peculiar and elegant name, which then spread throughout the country. In reality, it was just a joke.</p>
<p>Zhou, the traitor, was always two-faced. He said that when he served as the Minister of Propaganda in the early stages of the War of Resistance, he secretly advocated peace but never dared to express it. However, when asked in court whether he outwardly advocated resistance while inwardly advocating peace, he revealed an embarrassed expression. He had no response whatsoever. When talking about our sacred Blue Sky with a White Sun flag, he also reluctantly attached a shameful tail to it. Zhou, the traitor, smiled and repeatedly said, "Ashamed, don't mention it!" At this point, order in the courtroom deteriorated beyond repair. A swarm of people crowded into the courtroom, climbing onto the desks. The courtroom was filled with various shouts, and benches and tables were smashed to pieces. Groups of people standing on top of them fell to the ground. Zhou, the traitor, turned his head and looked back, smiling. The reporters, squeezed beyond help, used their backs to resist the crowding mob, continuing to record everything in the courtroom.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Zhou, the traitor, even criticized Wang, the traitor, for being dictatorial. According to him, the power to decide on major issues within the puppet organization was almost entirely in the hands of Wang, the traitor. They could only make slight modifications on minor details. For example, the decision on the "Peace Movement" was almost entirely handled by Wang, the traitor, alone. Mentioning the decision on the "Peace Movement" at that time, Zhou, the traitor, added with a smile, "Mr. Chen was even more resolute than Wang, the traitor."</p>
<p>The reporter loved to see that solemn face of President Zhao, upholding justice and fearing nothing. He sternly and solemnly recited Chairman Chiang's announcement at that time, refuting the Konoe Declaration: "The confidence in the War of Resistance cannot be shaken in the slightest, otherwise, they will be eternally guilty of the nation and the country." Under the solemn and righteous declaration, Zhou, the traitor, stammered again.</p>
<p>The court further produced records of Zhou, the traitor's crimes, such as "Japan is sincere," "Resistance will lead to national destruction," and "How painful it was to serve in the central government in the past." Everything was recorded in Zhou, the traitor's booklets, "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Construction" and "Memories and Prospects." In this booklet, Zhou, the traitor, also incidentally criticized President Sun Ke's erroneous international views at the time, but today, with the unfolding of facts; Zhou, the traitor, could only smile bitterly and say, "Now I truly know I was wrong." Furthermore, in this booklet, he even believed that he was the pioneer of the "Peace Movement."</p>
<p>When discussing Zhou, the traitor's large-scale issuance of counterfeit currency and acquisition of legal tender to support the enemy, the presiding judge lamented and narrated the moving stories of the people in the rear, how they died, struggled, worked, and fought under the enemy's relentless bombing. Finally, he rebuked Zhou, the traitor, for disrupting the financial stability of the rear through various methods. This time, it provoked Zhou, the traitor's temper. He loudly said that the court should not "casually" or "presumptuously" speculate about the situation at that time. However, when he realized that the word "casually" might cause displeasure in the court, he hurriedly smiled and corrected himself, saying, "Ah, not casually."</p>
<p>Next, Zhou, the traitor, in an "激昂" tone, delivered a fallacious statement, saying that he stabilized the finance in the occupied area, and that he was not "colluding with the enemy to resist the country," but "colluding with the enemy to save the country."</p>
<p>He also said: "The reserve of the Reserve Bank consists of 50,231 gold bars, 5.3 million US dollars, 7.690 million taels of silver, 330,000 silver dollars, 9.23 million reserve notes, 200,000 Japanese government bonds, and more than 52 million Shanghai original discount notes, as well as other stocks, movable and immovable properties. This reserve has been entirely handed over to the Central Bank of China. The total issue amount of the Reserve Bank is 41 trillion yuan."</p>
<h3>Witness Presents Evidence, Recounts Subversion and Rescue Work</h3>
<p>Finally, lawyer Wang Jiaxiang presented sixteen pieces of evidence favorable to Zhou, the traitor, and immediately summoned witnesses. Zhou showed a hint of a smile, gratefully helping them adjust the microphone in front of the witness stand. The first witness was Zhou Hao, who worked for the Military Intelligence Bureau. His relationship with Zhou, the traitor, began in January of the thirty-third year (1944), when he was ordered by the central government to come to the Southeast region to undertake subversion work. After arriving in Nanjing, he contacted Zhou through the introduction of another staff member, Chen Kexiang. Because he was in the enemy-occupied area at that time, his life was unpredictable. Since meeting Zhou, they immediately got along well. With Zhou's help, he was able to infiltrate the puppet government and take office. Also, through Zhou's introduction, he contacted Sun Liangcheng, the Director of Pacification for the puppet regime, and in the thirty-third year, he instigated Sun's army to move from Kaifeng to northern Jiangsu. The second was Wu Huawen (Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army of the puppet regime), subversion. Wu's army moved to the Bengbu area. Again, Zhang Lanfeng (Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army of the puppet regime), Ren Yuandao (Commander-in-Chief of the First Route Army of the puppet regime) all obeyed the central government after subversion work. The above measures were all carried out under my orders for subversion work. He negotiated with Zhou in advance. Zhou used his position as Deputy Director of the Military Committee to avoid enemy suspicion and issue command moves, planning to respond to the central government's counter-offensive, preparing to cover the Allied landing, and preventing the deployment of bandits. Zhou assisted greatly. The court asked Zhou Hao, is everything above true? Are you responsible? "I am willing to take absolute responsibility," he firmly replied.</p>
<p>The second witness, Zhang Shuping, testified that he met Zhou Fohai through the introduction of Tang Mang. After in-depth discussions, he knew that Zhou had regretted his past mistakes. Later, underground work comrade Liu was arrested and was also rescued by Zhou. Liu was a confidant of Gu Zhutong in the Third War Zone. At that time, Zhou appointed Liu as Chief of Staff of the Tax Police Corps. Therefore, Zhou also had liaison and subversion relations with Commander Gu, and Commander Gu can be asked to prove this. The third witness, Mei Siyi, also presented several pieces of evidence favorable to Zhou, and said that in March of the thirty-fourth year (1945), he was ordered by the Commander of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Border Region to go to Shanghai to discuss with Zhou, the traitor, how to proceed with the subversion work. Zhou, the traitor's attitude was quite sincere. When the court ordered a remand for further hearing, Zhou, the traitor, argued that "The defendant does not accept the charge in the indictment that he jointly colluded with the enemy to conspire to resist the country. After the thirty-third year, the defendant should be described as colluding with this country in the hope of resisting the enemy." This is noteworthy and is also something for the High Court President to study. We await the results of the continued hearing.</p>

<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Sulfonamides for External Use</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ming</p>
<p>Sulfonamide drugs, when used externally for bacterial infections of wounds and various suppurative skin diseases, indeed have various advantages and are much better than ordinary antiseptics. First, sulfonamides have very mild irritation and do not greatly hinder the speed of healing. Second, the antiseptic effect of ordinary antiseptics is very short, while the antiseptic effect of sulfonamides is very long, and their effect can last for one or two days after a single application. Third, sulfonamides, when used externally, have a higher concentration and have an inhibitory effect on various pyogenic bacteria, unlike some antiseptics whose effects are limited to only a few bacteria.</p>
<p>Due to the above advantages, sulfonamide drugs quickly replaced ordinary antiseptics and were widely used locally for various suppurative skin diseases and infections of the eyes, ears, nose, throat, etc. Some are liquids, used to drip into the eyes or nose; some are powders, used to sprinkle on wounds or ulcer surfaces; some are tablets, used to hold in the mouth; and there are even various ointments. There are countless brands on the market. In Shanghai, there are also manufacturers who make sulfathiazole (i.e., Xiaozhilong) into toothpaste, soaps, and other cosmetics, which are heavily marketed to prevent infections of the gums and skin, further extending sulfonamide drugs to everyday products.</p>
<p>However, the external use of sulfonamide drugs is not without danger, and the large-scale overuse as toothpaste and soaps is particularly dangerous. According to reports from scholars in various countries, external use of sulfonamides can easily cause sensitization. Once a patient becomes sensitized, there are various dangers: (1) Various rashes may appear on the skin, and severe cases can even be fatal. For example, Schwartz reported in 1944 that a patient who often used nasal drops containing sulfonamides unknowingly became sensitized. Later, he developed pneumonia, and the doctor, unaware of the sensitization, gave him sulfonamides. This caused a major disaster: the patient developed an extremely severe dermatitis all over his body, with large patches of skin peeling off, and coupled with urinary retention, he quickly died. (2) A small amount of externally applied sulfonamides is also absorbed into the body, and this trace absorption is most likely to cause sensitization. There may be no manifestation at the time, but once a serious infection such as pneumonia or meningitis occurs and sulfonamides are used for treatment, the latent sensitization will greatly manifest, causing various severe reactions. Some directly lead to death (as in the above example), and some prevent the patient from continuing to use the medication and die from incurable pneumonia or meningitis and other severe infectious diseases (there are many more examples that cannot be listed). (3) The last, but also the most dangerous, is the production of sulfonamide-resistant bacteria. After prolonged exposure to sub-inhibitory amounts of sulfonamides, most bacteria develop drug-fastness and can resist the antibacterial effects of sulfonamides. Even large doses are ineffective, and once such bacteria gain an opportunity in the body, they will proliferate uncontrollably, making it impossible to subdue them with sulfonamides. This is not only harmful to the patient but also a great harm to society if transmitted to others.</p>
<p>According to Abramowitz's estimation (1944), this sensitization often occurs. In the same year, Tate and Klorfain's statistics in British military hospitals showed that 3% of those who used sulfonamide drugs externally (mainly sulfanilamide) developed allergic reactions. Among sulfonamide drugs, sulfathiazole (i.e., Xiaozhilong) is particularly likely to cause allergic reactions. According to Darke's report, up to 6% of patients using sulfathiazole ointment developed allergic reactions.</p>
<p>Even very small amounts of locally applied sulfathiazole ointment can cause allergic reactions. Beche reported in January of this year that a patient who had a small boil on his nose applied some sulfathiazole ointment, and the boil healed after four days. Ten days later, a small pimple appeared on his arm, and he applied some ointment in the same way. However, twenty-four hours later, many wheals appeared on the area where the medication was applied and spread to areas where the medication was not applied, and it took several weeks to cure him.</p>
<p>Most patients, and even doctors themselves, are unaware of the various dangers of externally applied sulfonamides. Blaisdell knew of a doctor who often applied sulfathiazole ointment to patients, and some inevitably got on his hands each time. He rubbed his hands together to remove the ointment. As a result, he developed a rash all over his body.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Committee on Drugs and Chemistry of the American Medical Association published a report last year detailing the dangers of external use of sulfonamides, which aroused the attention of the medical community. They loudly called for opposing the indiscriminate use of sulfonamide drugs on the skin or mucous membranes and advocated that pharmacies should only sell sulfonamide drugs based on a doctor's prescription, and should not allow patients to purchase drugs for self-treatment. At the same time, they also advised doctors not to use sulfonamide topical medications casually, and if they have to risk using them due to a severe infection, they should not use them for more than five days. As for the daily use of sulfonamide toothpaste and sulfonamide soaps, they should of course be banned. In the United States, several states have now used laws to prohibit the public sale of sulfonamide topical medications without a doctor's prescription. It is hoped that our country's health authorities will also take appropriate measures to increase public safety.</p>
<h3>Digestive Ulcer Sound</h3>
<p>— Xia Zhenyi</p>
<p>Psychological Factors in Treatment</p>
<p>We firmly believe that emotional factors have a great impact on the persistence of symptoms and the hindrance of recovery in patients with peptic ulcers, especially in today's highly stressful society. We pay more attention to their psychological factors!</p>
<p>I have always felt that the greatest difficulty in psychological adjuvant therapy is that mental health cannot be achieved in a short period, and it is believed that each patient has different psychological problems and needs individual thinking, analysis and training. Therefore, some scholars have conducted very precise psychological research on many wealthy patients using individual approaches. If each patient has different psychological problems, then using individual approaches will have great effects. However, the result is that those patients did not get slight psychological improvement. Although we don’t have experimental evidence, we can believe that the main psychological factors of each patient have more commonality than individual particularity. We can see that all patients have the same symptoms: such as indigestion, extreme hunger, easy fear and anger, constipation and increased sensitivity to pain. As for the psychological aspect, there are also many commonalities: (1) Patients often feel mentally depressed, lazy, irritable, and have infinite difficulty in thinking. (2) They often use ill health as the focus of their conversations with relatives and friends. (3) They often want to use willpower to overcome their situation.</p>
<p>When emotions are tense, gastrointestinal movement speeds up, spasms, relaxation, and reduced blood circulation. These have a considerable relationship to the health of the gastrointestinal tract, because the healing of peptic ulcers is due to the formation of fibrous tissue in the affected area. This change is entirely a metabolic process. In a suitable environment, the affected area will heal itself. The suitable conditions are rest and sufficient blood circulation in the affected area. We know that physical rest and emotional tension are mutually exclusive. The body absolutely cannot rest when the brain is extremely stimulated and excited. Because the brain is often in a state of unpleasant emotions, it will stimulate the efferent nerves. Therefore, if they can avoid or reduce excessive emotions, the disease will not be difficult to heal on its own.</p>
<p>We cannot forget the close relationship between mind and body. When treating an internal medicine disease, we cannot ignore the psychological factors, especially for the treatment of peptic ulcers. In addition to medication and diet therapy, we must also pay attention to psychological therapy. The following are a few common principles on which psychological therapy is based:</p>
<p>(1) Suppression of worries: There are many ways to eliminate worries and boredom. The simplest and most direct method is to have patients learn some enjoyable activities or pastimes to replace boring thoughts. Later, appropriately guide patients to recall the most pleasant events in their past lives. Whenever they are bored and unhappy, they should try their best to recall those sweet and happy situations in the past. For most patients, childhood memories are of great help. This makes the bored mood disappear, and the heart is always filled with a source of joy and pleasure. Patients initially find it inconvenient to change their thinking, but after a few days of practice, they can cope with ease.</p>
<p>(2) Suppression of discussion: It is not difficult to suppress patients from often using difficulties as the focus of their discussions with relatives and friends, because if they know that this has an impact on the recovery of their condition, they can control themselves very well. However, the most important thing is to get the cooperation of their family members and friends. Relatives and friends should avoid talking about difficult things as much as possible. Whenever the patient is angry, the mother or wife should remind, hint, or advise him, so as to reduce emotional tension.</p>
<p>(3) Suppression of striving: Patients often want to use striving or willpower to overcome special situations, but they often become irritable because they cannot find a solution. This is a big disadvantage, because striving is contrary to the rest of the internal organs. Therefore, reduce or avoid striving as much as possible, and often guide them not to think about their troubles or use their emotions excessively. There are many special circumstances that patients have to pay attention to. The following is a very common example:</p>
<p>For example, the patient has developed a habit – when he goes to bed, there must always be a glass of milk on the table as a pain reliever when he is awakened by pain at night. Although he feels that this is a bad habit and should be removed, he still has some inclination towards this glass of milk in his heart. These two concepts are fighting in his brain, and he feels that he is too useless and too weak, and he does not have the determination to make a decision on this little thing. So he encourages himself and suppresses himself. This tendency to self-determination is the expression of using willpower or striving to solve difficulties. Therefore, whenever he has a slight inclination towards milk, he must do what he should do, regardless of whether he actually needs it. In fact, this habit is not very meaningful and important. What should be noted is that when he goes to bed, he should not have the fear of nighttime stomach pain and the absence of milk in his heart. In that way, if there is food that he dare not eat, it is best to avoid it or not eat it. When he wants to eat a certain food, he can eat a little bit, so that the fear is reduced, and the confidence in his own stomach strength is enhanced.</p>
<p>(4) Explanation talk: Give the patient a 45-minute psychological talk every day, expounding the nature of thoughts, the impact on physical activities and daily life, the source of ideas and the relationship of emotional reactions, and often praising the value and effectiveness of drug and diet therapy. From these talks and explanations, the patient can understand himself, improve himself and maintain health.</p>
<p>(5) Self-suggestion: We know that the patient's psychology has a great impact on health, but they often feel negative and pessimistic. This gray outlook on life should be broken, and an optimistic and positive outlook on life must be established. Therefore, the patient must always be confident that his condition has gradually recovered. Whenever he goes to bed at night or has not gotten up in the early morning, repeat the phrases suggested by Mr. Coue: "Day by day, every day, my health is improving." (Day by day, every day, I am getting better &amp; better). We firmly believe that the patient's self-confidence and thought change training are the two major elements to promote recovery.</p>
<p>(6) Inductive suggestion: Use inductive methods to make patients produce a kind of self-confidence. Mr. Bernbelu calls it inductive suggestion. This self-confidence includes digestion, absorption, sleep, activities, elimination of emotional tension and pain, and correction of constipation.</p>
<p>According to the results of the experiments of M.N. Chappell: J.J. Stefons and others, they claim that common psychological training can not only improve symptoms, but also help patients enjoy a healthy life for at least three years. Therefore, I am specially introducing it here. I hope that internists will not ignore the psychological factors of these patients when treating them.</p>

<h3>The Battle Between Humans and Germs (7)</h3>
<p>— Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>Excerpted from "Infectious Disease Management"</p>
<p>In the past, our management of infectious diseases has largely been a history of failures. This is because the true nature of infectious diseases was not fully understood in the past, and the measures taken were inevitably empty and impractical. Now that this publication has explained the three elements of infectious diseases in the thirteenth issue, it is appropriate to use the scientific methods we know to target these three elements and seek to eliminate and control them. Generally, cutting off one of the three elements of infection is sufficient to achieve prevention and control. From the perspective of human resources and economics, we should adapt to local conditions and to the times, starting from the easiest and most effective points. We know that our current knowledge is still very lacking, and future generations will look at us as we look at the past. However, at the current stage, we can only do this much, so that our country can effectively implement measures, and it is hoped that the unjust deaths and illnesses caused by infectious diseases can be reduced by more than half.</p>
<p>I. Curbing the Source of Infection</p>
<p>Suppressing the source of infection is the key strategy for infectious disease management, akin to "drawing firewood from under the cauldron." There are six main methods for suppressing the source of infection:</p>
<p>(1) Reporting - "Reporting" refers to the immediate reporting of any discovered cases of infectious diseases to the local health authorities.</p>
<p>A. When to Report - Reporting should be done as early as possible, and it should also be complete.</p>
<p>B. Who Should Report - In European and American countries, hospitals and private practitioners are generally responsible for reporting infectious diseases. In our country, the number of hospitals and doctors is too small, and other institutions and personnel are urgently needed to participate and assist.</p>
<p>C. Which Diseases to Report - Currently, only ten types of infectious diseases are designated as legally notifiable infectious diseases and must be reported: (1) Smallpox (2) Scarlet fever (3) Diphtheria (4) Epidemic Meningitis (5) Plague (6) Cholera (7) Typhoid and Paratyphoid fever (8) Bacillus dysentery (9) Typhus fever (10) Relapsing fever.</p>
<p>D. What to Report - The content of the report should be as concise as possible so as not to bore and discourage the reporter, especially since not all reporters in our country are technical personnel.</p>
<p>(2) Investigation - Investigation work should begin immediately after receiving the report.</p>
<p>A. Purpose of Investigation - Before starting the investigation, it is best to make the investigator understand the purpose of the investigation, so that the results can be more satisfactory.</p>
<p>B. Investigators - Usually,</p>
<p>(1) Public health nurses - are the main investigators, but</p>
<p>(2) Physicians</p>
<p>(3) Health inspectors, engineers</p>
<p>(4) Other personnel - are also sometimes needed.</p>
<p>C. Content of Investigation - The content of the investigation naturally varies with the type of infectious disease. The first investigation should be the most detailed. Regardless of the nature of the disease, the purpose of the investigation is generally focused on discovering the source of infection. Therefore, the following seven items are mostly indispensable:</p>
<p>1. Name of the patient's entire family (or co-residents)</p>
<p>2. Gender of the patient's entire family (or co-residents)</p>
<p>3. Age of the patient's entire family (or co-residents)</p>
<p>4. Occupation of the patient's entire family (or co-residents)</p>
<p>5. Past medical history of the patient's entire family (or co-residents)</p>
<p>6. Source of the patient's daily diet</p>
<p>7. Possible opportunities for infection for the patient</p>
<p>(3) Isolation - "Isolation" refers to the separation of patients with infectious diseases in designated places, so that the pathogens they carry no longer have the opportunity to infect others. This is indeed an important measure for the management of infectious diseases. If the first case can be strictly isolated, the disease can be prevented from spreading. Isolation is especially valuable for the prevention and control of rapid infectious diseases such as smallpox, cholera, plague, and typhus. However, for infectious diseases that are difficult to diagnose early and have early infectiousness, such as measles and pertussis, isolation is not easy to be effective. There are two types of isolation: home isolation and hospital isolation.</p>
<p>A. Home Isolation - The following points should be noted:</p>
<p>(1) For home isolation, there should be two rooms dedicated to isolating the patient, preferably upstairs.</p>
<p>(2) All items such as clothing, furniture, and utensils that the patient does not need should be removed in advance.</p>
<p>(3) The door should be closed or hung with a gauze curtain.</p>
<p>(4) The window should be opened to allow air circulation, and it should be screened to prevent the entry and exit of flies and mosquitoes. If there are already mosquitoes, flies, lice, etc. in the room, they should be killed immediately.</p>
<p>(5) Except for medical and nursing staff, no one else is allowed to enter. Medical and nursing staff must strictly pay attention to disinfection, hand washing, and changing clothes (isolation gowns).</p>
<p>(6) The patient's clothing and utensils must not be taken out of the room before disinfection.</p>
<p>(7) The patient's excrement, nasal mucus, sputum, and other filth should be disinfected, incinerated, or buried.</p>
<p>(8) Family members and guests are not allowed to visit the patient. If necessary, they can only speak softly through the curtain.</p>
<p>(9) When the patient recovers and no longer carries germs, he should take a bath and change clothes before going out.</p>
<p>Except for a few wealthy families who can hope to achieve this kind of home isolation, most families find it difficult to do so. However, even if this kind of isolation is not perfect, it is better than nothing. If the situation permits, it is best to send the patient to a hospital for isolation, which is not only complete but also provides proper treatment.</p>
<p>B. Hospital Isolation</p>
<p>(1) Infectious Disease Hospital or Isolation Hospital - This is a hospital dedicated to isolating and treating patients with infectious diseases. Every city should establish one.</p>
<p>1. Site Selection - The site should be high and dry, easy to drain, not located in a crowded area (residents within half a mile should not exceed six hundred), and the traffic should still be convenient.</p>
<p>2. Bed Allocation - Generally, one bed should be set up for every thousand people, but each hospital should not have less than twelve beds. More beds are more economical. Each bed should occupy 144 square feet of floor space and 6,000 cubic feet of fresh air per hour.</p>
<p>3. Bedside Isolation -</p>
<p>(1) Nursing and medical staff must wear isolation gowns and disinfect and wash their hands immediately after any direct or indirect contact with the patient.</p>
<p>(2) All clothing and utensils used by each patient must be strictly disinfected and limited to the use of that one patient.</p>
<p>(3) All excrement, nasal mucus, sputum, and other items from the patient must be strictly disinfected, incinerated, or buried.</p>

<h3>Possessing Every Grace</h3>
<p>— Sun Fuxi</p>
<p>Preface to the Study of Expression</p>
<p>Human faces are different, each like its heart. Because spirit is the face of the heart, having a heart is the origin of spirit. Therefore, facial appearance and demeanor, even the slightest word or movement, all come from the heart. Correcting words and actions can also correct the wickedness of the heart.</p>
<p>Often, fashionable beauties, at first glance, inspire respect and admiration. However, a single smile or word can reveal their depth or superficiality.</p>
<p>Our country has always valued etiquette. Whether solemn or lively, each has its strengths. Recently, the atmosphere has been poor, and education has been lacking, resulting in the majority of people seen in society being vulgar in speech and action, and flustered in demeanor. They can neither maintain the inherent solemnity of China, nor match the vitality of Europe and America. I am especially raising this issue and doing preliminary research.</p>
<p>The study of expression is a comprehensive blend of physiology, psychology, literature, and aesthetics. It makes a great contribution to literary description, pictorial representation, and theatrical performance, and is indispensable in daily life. European youths often have experts to guide them in practicing expressions in front of a mirror, so that they can be moderate in their dealings with people and things, so as not to lose their composure. Few people in our country pay attention to this, so there are no good teachers or good books to seek. To study this, one must always pay attention, in theaters, restaurants, streetcars, and on the road, observing the words and actions around, and investigating the causes and consequences of one's own words and actions. For example, at a gathering, observe the guests, some are silent and calm, some are jumping and laughing, and then analyze the reasons for one's own restraint and boredom, and the impact of one's own cheerful conversation on the environment at that time. We can discover many expressions that are like crying but not crying, like laughing but not laughing, and inappropriate expressions of crying and laughing.</p>
<p>Therefore, to seek progress, the first is the problem of knowledge. We must learn to know the standards of right and wrong. Second, and more importantly, is the problem of thought. If we have a righteous heart and deep love for humanity, we will not have expressions of contempt and disdain. Third, there is a more significant problem in the Chinese nation, which is the problem of physical strength. The reason why many Chinese people do not abide by morality and laws is that their physical constitution is too weak. "It is not that they do not want to advance, but their bodies cannot bear it." At public gatherings, they yawn, stretch, want to sit down after standing, and want to sleep after sitting. As a result, they leave before the end of the event. Based on the above three points, and then combining the standards of aesthetic education, we can hope to have moderate speech and laughter, and possess every grace.</p>
<p>This will not only add a lot of face to the country and the nation, but also, for the individual, enhance their status, reduce misunderstandings, and be of great help in their career.</p>
<h3>Where is Beauty?</h3>
<p>— Shusun Ruying</p>
<p>When we talk about art, we talk about beauty. Beauty is the essence of art, and aesthetic behavior is artistic behavior. A healthy life is a model of beauty, and a work of art is a crystallization of beauty. However, where does beauty, this elusive and mysterious thing, actually exist?</p>
<p>When we are admiring scenery, we praise, "This is truly beautiful!" When we are admiring a painting, we praise, "This is truly beautiful!" When we see a triumphant warrior returning home and his old mother who has been waiting for him leaning against the door, embracing each other and crying bitterly, we also secretly praise in our hearts, "This is truly beautiful!" We find traces of beauty everywhere, but we are never able to grasp the essence of beauty.</p>
<p>Where is beauty? Does it exist in the object, or does it exist in the heart?</p>
<p>If you say that beauty exists in the object, in natural scenery, in works of art, in the generous and tragic behavior of human beings, then I must ask you, why does a farmer who is busy all year round never find the beauty of the mountains and rivers in front of his village? Why are works of art just like goods in the eyes of an antique dealer who makes a living by buying and selling old calligraphy and paintings? In the minds of a group of brave men who are charging towards the enemy under a hail of bullets, why does the excitement and tension overwhelm all feelings, and there is no talk of beauty or ugliness at all?</p>
<p>Take a famous painting as an example. This painting is regarded as a treasure in the hands of a collector, but in the eyes of a poor person who is not clothed and fed, this painting is not as valuable as a piece of bread. Even if this painting falls into the hands of a vulgar nouveau riche, he may regret that the light ink bamboo in the painting is not as auspicious as the figures of Fu, Lu, and Shou. Moreover, when Beaumarchais' comedy "The Marriage of Figaro" was published, French critics unanimously condemned it as vulgar and mediocre, but after several performances, it finally received unanimous praise. Even critics cannot see the beauty of a good work of art. Then, to say that beauty exists in the object, or rather, to say that beauty exists in the heart of the appreciator is more accurate.</p>
<p>But to say that beauty exists in the heart also has some major misunderstandings. A bad painting will never become more beautiful because the person appreciating it is a poet. A blank piece of paper is just a blank piece of paper in the eyes of a painter, and cannot make him have a feeling of beauty. For a person who knows how to appreciate, he has a higher standard for beauty, and he is unwilling to look at general works of art. Things that ordinary people think are beautiful, he often finds extremely ugly. The reason why beauty is beautiful is definitely not a one-sided illusion of appreciation. Therefore, we cannot believe the saying that beauty exists in the heart.</p>
<p>Beauty does not exist in the object, nor does it exist in the heart. So, where does beauty actually exist?</p>
<p>When our heart comes into contact with external objects, we become aware. The heart observes, the object is observed, the heart evaluates, and the object is evaluated. When this act of observation or evaluation occurs, beauty, or ugliness, appears.</p>
<p>From this, we can know that beauty is neither the measure of the heart nor the attribute of the object, but simply a harmonious unity of the heart and the object. Beauty only has the possibility of appearing when the heart and the object intersect. Just like "There are steeds, and then there are masters of equitation (Bo Le)." Even if there are steeds, without a master of equitation, the steeds cannot be called steeds. Even if it is a work of art, if there is no appreciator, the beauty of the work of art is buried in vain, and cannot be said to exist.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if the heart and the object enter the aesthetic realm when they intersect, the value judgment of beauty often varies from person to person. Taking reading poetry as an example, some people like Tao Yuanming, and some people are fond of Li Yishan, and believe that what they love is beautiful, and what they do not love is not beautiful. The so-called beauty here is subjective beauty. Subjective beauty may appear as long as the heart and the object intersect and an aesthetic act occurs. Therefore, cigarette advertisement paintings are also beautiful in the hearts of elementary school students, and the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea are also beautiful in the hearts of the tutors in rural schools. However, this beauty does not necessarily conform to objective standards, and is not the main object of study for researchers of aesthetics.</p>
<p>The search for objective standards of beauty is one of the main tasks of those who study aesthetics, but this standard is very difficult to determine. Moreover, the so-called objective beauty here is only relative objective beauty. The existence of objective beauty must also be at the time of the intersection of the heart and the object, but it needs to be accompanied by additional conditions, and it needs to be in a state of unity between the subject and the object, so that objective beauty can be recognized.</p>
<h3>Awakening Thoughts (Sculpture)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chongren</p>
<h3>An Old Woman Playing the Qin — Yangzhou Continued Dream, Four —</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>"Lowering her eyebrows, she plucks the strings continuously, telling all the infinite things in her heart." This is the mournful voice of a merchant's wife on the Xunyang River. However, in this mournful voice, there is only resentment and hatred of separation. As for her sense of twilight and the suffering of sinking, it seems that there is a world of difference compared to the old woman playing the qin on the Slender West Lake.</p>
<p>The old woman playing the qin on the Slender West Lake often plays and sings in Luyang Village. Many old tea drinkers say that she was originally a famous courtesan in her youth. Why didn't she find a home while time hadn't taken away her beauty? Even "marrying an old man to a merchant" was impossible. The old men lamented and said, "She was really too popular at that time. She always thought that flowers could bloom forever and the moon could be full forever!"</p>
<p>She has been singing for a long time in Luyang Village. At first, she seemed to be still a fading beauty. Classical costumes, combined with the remaining charm, can make people reminiscent of the prosperity of the Silk Willow City in the past. Therefore, there were still many tea drinkers who spent money to have her play and sing every day. She plays the moon qin and sings outdated songs, like the cuckoo crying at night and the cicada singing in late autumn, which is enough to make the audience's hearts churn. However, time is forcing her to imitate, and after the remaining charm has disappeared, the tea drinkers who want her to play and sing have also decreased. So she has to automatically play and sing in front of many tea drinkers. After playing and singing for a while, she automatically asks the tea drinkers for a few cents. Begging is not easy. She doesn't know how many cold stares she has received, and she doesn't know how many smiles she has given to people. Later, the tea drinkers' attitude towards her seems to have become worse as she became older and uglier. So when she plays and sings, she shrinks to the side, and almost doesn't dare to face the tea drinkers, just wanting to use her suppressed singing to arouse some compassionate feelings in others.</p>
<p>However, although she was abandoned by many tea drinkers, some older people still seemed to have some old feelings for her that had not been completely destroyed. This is a common occurrence. When the setting sun passes over the western mountains, the twilight is vast, and gradually encompasses the earth, she tidies up the moon qin, and with a tired and disappointed expression, when she is about to leave Luyang Village, she will encounter some old tea drinkers, ask about her singing situation, shake her head and sigh for her, and even greet the waiter to prepare some refreshments for her to eat. "Thank you very much, Old Master!" she says, and at the same time casts a flirtatious look at the old man. The old man also stroked his beard and smiled. At this time, the old woman playing the qin and the old man both seemed to have returned to their youth, and were warming up their youthful dreams. Unfortunately, this beautiful dream will eventually wake up! Today, the old woman playing the qin and those old tea drinkers are no longer seen on the Slender West Lake. They should have abandoned the lakes and mountains and are sleeping underground!</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 72</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>In our office, almost everyone was doing something to kill time. Some were smoking cigarettes, blowing out one circle after another; some were writing diaries or something; some were turning the newspaper upside down, looking for something to read; some were fixing their eyes on the ceiling, as if a movie was being projected on it; some were leaving their seats in a hurry, running through the rooms, maybe to go to the toilet, and then hurrying back. And so on, and so on. However, every minute or two, someone would look at the clock on the wall, checking it against their own watch or pocket watch; there were fifteen minutes, fourteen minutes, thirteen minutes, twelve minutes left...</p>
<p>But when the clock on the wall was clearly seven or eight minutes away from five o'clock, suddenly, we heard a deafening explosion, right near our office, and even the glass window panes shook with a "bang"; everyone exclaimed "Huh" in unison. This was the signal we had agreed upon to take action. Why was it seven or eight minutes early? We may still not find the reason now; according to the person in charge of this matter, he said afterwards that he had indeed given the order on time, and he had left the headquarters an hour before, and had checked the time before leaving. When the people who came to question him compared their watches, they were all exactly the same. This matter was really inexplicable.</p>
<p>As soon as the signal cannon sounded, the captain looked at the clock on the wall, and then looked at his own watch, frowned, and immediately waved his hand. Hu Di and I immediately jumped up from the building, left the office, and took the six messengers who were waiting outside, and set off in two cars. The puppet public mansion was at most five or six minutes away from us. When we were still some distance away, we had already heard gunfire erupting, and the puppet public mansion was on fire. At this time, the sky was not yet bright, and although it was dim, everything could still be seen vaguely, but some places and things were instead made somewhat dim by the fire. About three or four hundred yards away from the puppet public mansion, the road was already chaotic, and the streets and alleys were filled with all kinds of people, running around, some in military uniforms, some civilians, and some security guards.</p>
<p>Although it was chaotic, the martial law situation had already been established, and security team squads were stationed at each important intersection to carry out defenses. Anyone without the special armband issued by our headquarters was not allowed to pass. These people crowded in the streets and alleys were originally somewhat inexplicable about this action, but in a few minutes, our propaganda squads lurking in various districts had used the fastest distribution method to spread our printed "Proclamation to the Citizens," and everyone knew what was going on, so they followed the instructions on the proclamation, and everyone first sorted out a blue sky and white sun national flag and quickly hung it at their door.</p>
<p>Hu Di and I saw that the car was difficult to pass for a while, so we instructed the driver to park the car on the side of the road to wait. We each took out our weapons and got out of the car on foot. When we arrived at the puppet public mansion, we found the person in charge of the command and learned that things were going extremely smoothly. They were now deploying the surrendering guards, counting documents, and so on; at the same time, they were also assigning people to put out the fire and deploy defenses. Immediately, I quickly wrote a report, and Hu Di and I signed it, and assigned two messengers to report to the headquarters.</p>
<p>"Report!" At this time, Hu Di suddenly stood at attention to me and gave a military salute; this was the first time he had done this since he took office, and he did it quite well; he must have practiced a lot in secret. But I didn't expect it for a moment and was startled. "Reporting to the captain, - I want to go over there to catch thieves." "Over there" was pointing to the residences of the rebellious figures.</p>
<p>I thought that arresting the treacherous Yin was also an urgent matter, and it was indeed necessary to go help, so I agreed to let him go quickly, and instructed him not to be greedy for credit, because there were people specifically responsible for searching the rebellious residences and arresting the treacherous figures. We were just providing some assistance. I also instructed him to return to headquarters at exactly six o'clock, where we would meet and go outside the city. I also repeatedly instructed him not to lose contact.</p>

<h3>Ants and Aphids</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>If you enjoy rights, you must fulfill obligations.</p>
<p>Let's look at the ants in the biological world.</p>
<p>Ants can cohabit with other small creatures, such as beetles and other insects, spiders, land crustaceans, etc., and the most common is cohabitation with aphids. What is the state of their cohabitation? According to the results of biologists' investigations:</p>
<p>Ants use the two antennae on their heads to rub the back of the aphid, causing the aphid to secrete sugar, and then take the opportunity to lick it. But ants can drive away the enemies of aphids, protect aphids, and sometimes even take the eggs of aphids and move them into their nest. After winter, when the spring warms up, they move the hatched young aphids to the tender buds of plants. If they encounter harsh weather, they move the young aphids back into the nest to take temporary shelter.</p>
<p>Ants are so busy, responsible, and fulfilling their obligations in order to lick a little sugar on the back of the grasshopper (which they rub out with their own antennae).</p>
<p>Killing chickens to eat eggs is even more out of the question. Today, there are many such cruel and foolish people in society.</p>

<h3>Mediation for Divorce</h3>
<p>— Chai Fei</p>
<p>Mediation institutions for marital disputes are not yet common in our country. Such disputes should not be entirely brought to court. It falls within the scope of social services, and the social service agencies established by the Ministry of Social Affairs in various regions should take on the task of marital mediation. The case of Chen Jizheng suing Sa Benju and Shi Biren for adultery and disrupting the family (the so-called "Anti-Japanese War Wife" case) ultimately ended up in court. In a healthy society, the preliminary handling of this case should have been done by a social service organization.</p>
<p>In the United States, there are specialized agencies for marital mediation, and some even consider it a lifelong vocation. The best marital mediation work is generally recognized to be done by the Family Dispute Mediation Department in Milwaukee. Mrs. Nippert, the head of the department, has reconciled estranged couples and achieved better results than any other American in this field.</p>
<p>She says, "Many divorces are caused by illness, which prevents them from engaging in normal occupational activities, and each case needs to be handled individually." It is clear that she does not emphasize the superficial reasons for marital disputes. Her work can be said to benefit more than just Milwaukee. Sociologists warn us that wartime divorce cases are surging, reaching the point where nearly one in five American couples are divorcing, but Milwaukee has been trying to turn the tide with significant results. Judges and social service agencies in cities across the United States, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and Australia have requested Mrs. Nippert to provide them with reference materials to help them organize similar marital mediation agencies.</p>
<p>What Causes Couples to Fall Out? A Broken Mirror Can Be Mended.</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Nippert took over, only one in fifteen marital dispute mediations in Milwaukee was successful. Now, almost half of the families on the verge of breaking up are reconciled through mediation. According to officials in Milwaukee's Civil Affairs Department, "The $37,000 annual budget we give to the mediation department led by Mrs. Nippert is truly the best investment the city government has made."</p>
<p>How does Mrs. Nippert approach her mediation work? For example, when a couple like the Schoberts comes to the mediation department, Mrs. Nippert asks:</p>
<p>"Why do you want a divorce?"</p>
<p>"He's a drunk, often threatening me and hitting me right on the nose," the wife complained.</p>
<p>"She's always spitting on me and wants to leave me!" the husband defended himself. "The pastor at the church told us to come see you."</p>
<p>Mrs. Nippert nods, not surprised. Of the ten thousand divorce cases handled by Mrs. Nippert and her twelve assistants, about one-third are referred by pastors, relatives, or even judges. Another third are referred by the Milwaukee Family Court. The rest are couples who come to the department voluntarily seeking mediation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nippert asks in a sympathetic tone, discovering that the root cause of the Schoberts' divorce is that the husband is not very successful in his job at the factory, so he drinks to forget his troubles and often argues with his wife. The wife endured it for a month before finally losing her temper and wanting a divorce.</p>
<p>Using Psychological Tests to Study the Causes of Divorce</p>
<p>"I think," Mrs. Nippert says calmly, "Mr. Schobert's job is the main reason for your wanting a divorce." Both of the Schoberts look at her in confusion. She then asks a volunteer psychologist to test Mr. Schobert's work ability.</p>
<p>The psychologist's test results show that Mr. Schobert is not suitable for working as a machinist; during his free time, he relieves his depression by fixing cars. Now he has become the head of the repair shop, has almost quit drinking, and gets along very well with his wife.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nippert sometimes discovers the crux of the problem from the testimonies of the children of divorcing couples. A high school student described the heartbreaking family situation: "Dad is as honest as an old shoe, but Mom often leaves him to go to clubs and fashionable social gatherings, mingling with those she considers respectable people. Dad, however, prefers to hide in the basement playing with his beloved rocking horse. They think they should get a divorce because someone is pursuing Mom. But Mom and Dad really love each other."</p>
<p>So Mrs. Nippert offers the divorcing couple this advice: "The husband should accompany his wife to social gatherings once a week; the wife, in turn, should encourage her husband to play with his rocking horse, but shouldn't always nag him about constantly mingling with so-called respectable people." The result is also very effective.</p>
<p>Later, two girls told Mrs. Nippert that their father always listened to his grandmother when handling family matters, which often led to quarrels with their mother. Mrs. Nippert then advised the man to see a psychiatrist. After learning the reasons for his unhappy family life, he began to realize that he was forty years old and should make his own decisions about everything. From then on, he never mentioned the word divorce again.</p>
<p>Wife Not Bearing Sons Affects Marital Relationship</p>
<p>Mrs. Nippert believes that the first thing to investigate when looking into the causes of divorce is the health of the husband or wife. A young woman suffering from migraines once complained to Mrs. Nippert that she could no longer live with her husband. Mrs. Nippert asked a psychiatrist to advise her to live comfortably, get enough sleep, and participate less in dances and club activities. Six weeks later, her condition improved, and she realized that she also had to take responsibility for the marital conflicts.</p>
<p>A couple often quarreled because the wife could not have children, and a neighbor went to Mrs. Nippert for help. As a result, a psychiatrist pointed out that they should adopt a child, and the quarrels stopped.</p>
<p>Economic difficulties often lead to divorce. Mrs. Nippert always advises people not to get divorced impulsively. If the family's finances are currently tight, forming a second family after divorce will not necessarily improve the situation, and the cost of divorce is at least $500 each time.</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty Mrs. Nippert faces in her mediation work is the relentless attacks from greedy judges and lawyers, who accuse her and her assistants of being "despicable intruders into the private lives of Milwaukee families." But in reality, she is, as she herself says, a social worker. Since her husband died in World War I, she has been engaged in marital mediation, and to date, a total of ten thousand couples have been saved from the brink of disaster through her mediation. No matter how strong the difficulties she encounters, she still works tirelessly. She says that now she is busy all day, starting her second ten thousand mediation cases.</p>
<p>The experience of foreigners makes us feel that dealing with anything in today's world cannot be separated from science, and those engaged in social service work in China should pay more attention to this.</p>

<h3>The So-Called "Anti-Japanese War Wife"</h3>
<p>— Sheng Jie</p>
<p>The so-called "Anti-Japanese War Wife" case, which was highly valued by the people of Shanghai, has come to an end with the first instance verdict that Sa Benju and Shi Biren were each sentenced to four months of imprisonment for adultery (and mutual adultery).</p>
<p>The plaintiff still wants to appeal, and the outcome is still unknown. However, this verdict only addresses the act of adultery itself. How these one man and two women will handle their future relationship is a matter of fact, and it may become a de facto one husband and two wives situation. If so, they are probably more troubled than happy. I dare not talk about right and wrong, I just feel like how should this kind of problem be handled well?</p>
<p>First of all, I think the so-called "Anti-Japanese War Wife" is a bit of a fabricated term. The law clearly states that they committed adultery, but in reality, they are praised as "Anti-Japanese War Wife". I don't know which "Anti-Japanese War Husband" concocted this. I guess the intention is to reduce their legal responsibility. Therefore, the defense lawyer in the Sa case simply made a "tangential" defense in court, saying that the defendant was ordered by ××× to do this and that, and had contributed to the Anti-Japanese War, which could be used as a reference for the trial, which is extremely far-fetched!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the original wife who stayed in the occupied area is generally referred to as the "Occupied Wife". I don't know how this came about. In fact, it is inappropriate to put the word "occupied" before "wife". Who did she fall into the hands of? After the victory, it should be "recovered"! If we say that the wife stayed in the occupied area and did not fall into anyone's hands and waited bitterly for dawn, but once dawn broke, the husband brought back a "wife" wearing an "Anti-Japanese War" hat, and at the same time regarded his original wife as an "occupied" "wife", it is really a violation of loyalty and integrity and is unacceptable!</p>
<p>Similar cases occur due to wartime displacement and need not be seen as very serious. However, if we create terms and regard "adultery between people with spouses" as a tacitly approved and legitimate matter, it will inevitably affect the proper order of social organization! In the first instance, the Sa Shi case could be settled with a "fine of 120,000 yuan". Whether this is reasonable or not, we (outsiders to the law) do not need to make arbitrary judgments. What must be pointed out is that the trend of creating terms must not be allowed to spread! I believe that in many so-called "Anti-Japanese War Wife" cases, many of the protagonists (indulgent men) would commit adultery even if they did not fight in the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<h3>A Notable Figure in the Balkans: Turkish President İnönü</h3>
<p>— Mi Shan</p>
<p>The Soviet-Turkish relationship, which has attracted worldwide attention, has deteriorated further due to the dispute over the Dardanelles Strait. Turkey's response to the Soviet Union has been published, firmly rejecting joint control of the Straits. The subsequent development of the situation concerns the safety of the entire Europe, and all parties are paying great attention to it. During the war, Turkey was in a state of siege on all sides, but it still refused to yield and adhered to neutrality, which ultimately restrained Hitler's ambitions. After the war, it still navigated between the great powers in a tense atmosphere, and always handled the situation with ease without suffering any losses. Therefore, everyone admires the person who holds the reins of the country, a very capable and sophisticated figure.</p>
<p>Turkish leader İsmet İnönü is the successor of former Turkish President Atatürk and one of the two great founding fathers of Turkey. His original name was İsmet Pasha, but his current name represents a glorious victory. During the Turkish-Greek War of 1921-1922, he led the Turkish army to an unprecedented victory in the İnönü region. To commemorate his military achievements, the place name was made his surname.</p>
<p>İnönü was born in 1884 and graduated from military school in 1906. Before he was twenty years old, he was already the leader of a secret party that overthrew Turkey. During the Russo-Turkish War in 1916, he met Atatürk in the army, and from then on, they formed a lasting friendship. He served as Atatürk's chief of staff at the time. His military achievements in the İnönü region during the Turkish-Greek War laid the foundation for his future career. After the victory of the Turkish-Greek War, he was sent to Switzerland as a representative for peace negotiations. He transformed from a soldier into a politician and diplomat.</p>
<p>From 1923, he served as Prime Minister for six consecutive years. In 1938, after Atatürk passed away, the National Assembly elected him to succeed as President. He was re-elected in 1943. In the general election in Turkey in August of this year, İnönü won seven-eighths of the votes with the campaign slogan "Don't change horses midstream," and was elected for another term.</p>
<p>İnönü's personality is completely opposite to that of Atatürk. Everyone knows that Atatürk was a passionate, courageous, and flamboyant person. His completion of the revolution and promotion of the reform movement was like a storm. İnönü, on the other hand, likes to be calm. He has the ability to "not seek recognition and listen without speaking." Patience and politeness are the secrets to his success. When dealing with enemies, he will pretend to be a paper tiger until the end. Even when fighting with powerful countries, he is still amiable and polite on the surface, but he always insists on his own views and refuses to change them.</p>
<p>Little is known about İnönü's private life. It is not easy to find his trace in public gatherings. When he does appear, he is always wearing a neat English-style suit. He has a very happy family with three children. He usually likes to ride horses. He does not drink alcohol at all, and even at social gatherings, it is rare for him to drink a glass of wine.</p>
<p>Turkey does not have a strong military backing, and its geographical location straddles Europe and Asia. In particular, the Dardanelles Strait, which controls the passage from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, is a strategic location that the great powers must compete for. If the rulers are not careful, they are in danger of being caught in a war. İnönü's foreign policy has always been to take advantage of the conflicts between European powers to allow Turkey to "reap the benefits." He strives to liaise with the United States and Britain, and strives to continue to maintain Turkey's exclusive defense of the Dardanelles Strait. Due to his thorough handling and smooth skills, the small and weak Turkey has gradually gained international attention. Atatürk often praised him during his lifetime: "İnönü is the most sophisticated person in Turkey!"</p>
