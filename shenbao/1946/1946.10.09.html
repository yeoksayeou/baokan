<h3 id="c1">馬司發表公開聲明　中共拒絕張垣停戰　和平商談局勢又遭頓挫 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕行政院宋院長八日下午八時發表談話如下，政府與中共談判陷於數月停頓之後，曾有兩個建議，陸續，陸續提出，企圖打開僵局：（一）司徒大使建議組設非正式五人小組，討論國民政府之改組，俾中共參加，中共予以拒絕；（二）政府又提議於召開五人小組之外，同時召開三人會議，討論整軍問題，以期迅速停止軍事衝突，中共未予置答，十月八日馬帥吿中共代表，蔣主席允停止向張家口前進，以十日爲期，於此期中磋商政治軍事改組之二關鍵問題，中共現又拒絕此新建議，實屬遺憾之至，但政府仍望繼續談判，以求中共問題之和平解決。</p>
<p>〔本報甫京八日電〕馬特使曁司徒大使八日下午發表公開聲明後，本報記者下午七時特訪司徒大使，請以調人地位發表談話，當蒙接見，略稱，此次發表公開聲明，在使全中國人士明瞭和談內容，馬歇爾將軍與余未加入任何意見，乃欲留一餘地，使讀者能加以判斷，對和談經過，大使曾將月初以來調處情形詳加分析，認爲政府方面竭誠謀求和平，企望停戰，並稱，其初大家都承認合作，吾人認爲如國府委員會能改組成立，一切問題均可一步步求得解決，比如政府所提停戰十日內，軍調部執行小組人員之進入地區問題，中共曾懼政府人員將到處行動，我們都願負責，政府是切盼停戰，但現在又生變化，至中共所要求之停戰保證，馬將軍和我即聲明盡力保證，我們的希望很高，因爲我們知道政府想停戰，同時也想要民主政府，中共亦如此，但此種談判，決不能懷疑太甚，以致造成很悽慘的悲劇，最後大使鄭重吿記者，如果局勢有挽回可能，我們還是要盡力的，且正期待共產黨答覆，大使今日語音低沉，記者雖置身華麗之客廳中，亦不免有如臨深淵之感，大使最後不否認目前時局嚴重，但認爲如有餘地，仍將盡力，記者與其握別後，彼等即逕赴馬帥行館祝馬夫人壽誕。</p>
<p>馬司聲明原文</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日〕馬歇爾將軍與司徒雷登大使於八日發表公開聲明，原文如次：「十月一日上午馬歇爾將軍經由共黨代表王炳南之手，接到九月三十日周恩來將車由上海所發之備忘錄一件，叙述國民黨之種種活動。末後並稱：「本人現奉下項事實通知</p>
<p>閣下，並請求台端代爲轉呈政府方面：若國民黨政府不中止對張家口及其附近一帶之軍事行動，則中共將被迫假定政府已公開宣佈全面破裂，終於放棄其所宣佈之和平解決政策。事態演變至於此種階段，一切嚴重後果之責任，自應完全由政府方面負祖之。」</p>
<p>徇周恩來將軍之請，上述備忘錄已轉呈蔣主席。十月二日主席以備忘錄答覆馬帥，引述共黨軍隊之若干敵對行爲。主席在此一備忘錄中建議：爲節省時間及表示政府之誠意起見，政府將作如下最高限度之讓步，藉以解決當前之間題：</p>
<p>（一）中共不斷催促國民政府改組，而改組之關鍵爲名額之分配，政府原同意國民政府委員名額內中共八名，民盟四名，共十二名，中共則要求中共十名，民盟四名共十四名。茲政府折衷讓步中共八名，民盟四名，無黨派名額中一名，由中共推薦，政府同意共十三名，中共應即行提出國府委員中共方面之名單，及其國民大會代表名單；但此項協議由非正式五人小組會議協定後，仍交由綜合小組，取得協議。</p>
<p>（二）爲切實實施整軍方案，先行迅速規定中共十八個師之駐地，並遵照規定期限，進入駐地，此項決議，應由三人會議正式協定後，交由軍事調處執行部監督施行。</p>
<p>如中共眞有和平合作之誠意，並願迅速解決此二問題，則雙方當於獲得協議時，立即宣吿停止軍事行動。</p>
<p>此項通知立即轉達共黨代表，而共黨代表復在同一星期內訪問美方調解人，請求說明委員長十月二日之備忘錄是否爲答覆周恩來九月卅日之備忘錄，因其中並未提及張家口一節。</p>
<p>以後，委員長與馬帥及司徒大使連續舉行數次討論，結果委員長同意由渠下令中止向張家口推進，爲期十天，在此十天內五人小組與三人小組將舉行會議，以便考慮十月二日委員長所提出之二次建議，委員長並同意，在此休戰時期內，執行總部將在各要點會同執行小組調查是否遵守休戰之約定，但在共軍陣綫內，則政府代表並不與執行小組同往，國共兩軍之間，亦有執行小組駐在其間，由雙方互派代表參加。此外，美方代表將有權決定執行小組前往何處及何時進行，而代表本人則將報吿渠所認爲事實上破壞休戰約定之任何行動，委員長並同意休戰公報，將由美方調停人發表之，國共雙方均須避免發表任何公報。</p>
<p>此項消息於十月六日下午一時半送達中共代表王炳南君，轉致在滬之周恩來將軍。</p>
<p>今日（十月八日星期二），王炳南君以口頭表明經由周恩來將軍之延安方面的答復，內容如次：</p>
<p>（一）休戰應無期限，蓋按照以往經騐，除此以外，必不能滿意也。除我政府表現其誠意，將軍隊撤至原來陣地，上項建議似係一種戰略而已。</p>
<p>（二）共黨甚盼三人及五人小組能召集會議，但討論範圍不應僅限於委員長十月二日備忘錄中之兩段。在休戰狀態下所涉及之主題，可視爲係在軍事威迫之下。</p>
<p>（三）對於十月二日之備忘錄中，未予答復，因共黨甚盼馬帥與司徒大使闡明獲取和平之局勢也。</p>
<p>最近之建議，顯示局勢未有甚大之變化，職是之故，周將軍準備提出書面答復，並認爲暫無返京之必要。</p>
<h3 id="c2">政府希望周恩來即返京參加商談　梁漱溟對共黨答覆表示驚詫 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕日來各方期待之共產黨答復，由延安交周恩來於昨夜送京，八日上午十一時王炳南訪司徒大使，口頭通知其意見，王辭走後，大使即訪馬特使商洽，並吿知一切，其私人顧問傅涇波，亦即於十二時許訪宋院長，下午四時大使再邀董必武·王炳南往晤，就午前所談加以檢討，京中人士自下午五時閱讀晚報後，悉共產黨對政府所採態度後，即紛以破裂即將來臨之恐懼心理相傳吿，旋美大使館再發出馬特使曁司徒大使之公開聲明，政治空氣進至昨日之期望不料又瀰漫消極之情緒矣。記者旋往訪政府方面邵力子，張厲生諸氏，彼等俱稱，吾人截至目前止，仍希望周恩來返京重開談判，並一致以爲馬司兩調人之公正誠摯至爲可感。民盟梁漱溟則稱，事前毫無所知，且對共產黨答覆表示驚詫，當稱，今晚將訪董老晤談，以詢究竟。共產黨代表團發言人則向記者作如下之解釋，一·美方文吿發表前，吾人毫無所知，董必武午後赴大使館時，亦尙未獲悉，直至發表後始知，二·文吿內有一與原建議不相符合者，即在十天休戰期內，政府實指明要共產黨對政府十月二日之備忘錄內所提兩點予以「實行」，而文告內則爲「可以考慮」。又關於軍隊退回原防問題，乃是指進攻張家口之車隊撤回原防，而非全部軍隊撤回原防。記者曾詢其對此項公開文告意見，發言人稱，周恩來將有一正式聲明宣佈，現正起草中，待草就自可表明共產黨之態度矣。</p>
<h3 id="c3">中共迭次失信　馬司提出質詢 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京八日電〕馬歇爾特使與司徒雷登大使今日午後四時召請中共代表董必武至美大使館會議，俾確定中共對妥協新建議之觀點兩使此舉，似爲最後一分鐘之努力，以期挽回迅趨惡化之和談大勢。董氏向兩使再度申明中共態度，謂中共以無條件全面休戰爲恢復和談之前提，馬使問，中共一度曾謂政府如果伴攻張垣，中共即將參加五人會議，現中共爲何拒絕參加。董氏答，中共從未有此宣佈，因政府與美方調人均未保證會議如果進行，政府將停止軍事行動。兩便又謂，今政府巳允停攻張垣，不解中共爲何又向政府提出新要求，董氏答，如果政府軍仍在距張垣十五哩內，中共未能認爲該城之危險已除，董氏復提反建議，主張國軍退至九月一日以前原來陣地。同時，此間中共代表團現正縝密研究馬司聲明，中共發言人謂，聲明引述周恩來之答覆，頗多謬誤，如末句謂周氏「……認爲不必返京」，殊可驚詫，蓋王炳南轉達答覆時，已將此句剔除也</p>
<h3 id="c4">周恩來離京來滬　確負有重大使命 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>逃避談判指揮中共</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕際此和平不絕如縷之時，各方對中共代表周恩來之行止頗爲注意，若干無黨無派人士，咸盼周氏廿日即自滬返京，打開僵局，據此間某觀察家指稱，周恩來此次去滬，</p>
<p>似係出諸預定計劃之行動，旨在逃避商談，蓋周氏深知　蔣主席自贛返京後，政府必將邀請周氏恢復商談也。另自消息靈通方面獲悉，周氏赴滬任務，中共方面雖宣稱係爲交涉群眾週刊被查禁事實則僅爲烟幕，其任務乃在力促民盟諸首要間恢復團結，在中共策動和利用之下，以應付即將到來之召開國大之局面，蓋二月來張瀾抱病成都與羅隆基有中立與不中立之爭，黃炎培除專心致力敎育事業外，無有表示，沈鈞儒亦頗沉默，而乏活動，梁漱溟則有辭去民盟秘書長之意，此種局面，自爲周恩來所極端關切，民盟諸首要之集會上海，適在周恩來抵滬之後，其間關係不能謂爲偶合。又周氏抵滬後，曾對聯合社記者談稱，渠已退出商談，除非蔣主席同意召開軍事三人小組會議，　不返南京，但迄三人小組及五人小組將同時舉行時，中共又提條件，以資阻撓，是益證明其去滬除促民盟團結外，猶另具用心，故周氏去滬與下列數端有關，實爲確證：</p>
<p>（一）與中軍區聯絡部長等要員商談新派到滬特工之佈置。</p>
<p>（二）督促京滬二地之公開工作人員結束對外界活動，集中上海準備撤退，並　專人擬訂疏散計劃：</p>
<p>（三）策動同情中共份子，組成所謂實力援助中共委員會，向國內外募集巨款，俾中共可以獲得互量實物援助；</p>
<p>（四）與某方面交涉交通運輸聯絡，以便在滬所獲所援助物資，可以順利運往共區；</p>
<p>（五）策動反美運動，在中美兩國掀起反美風潮，聞已飭由專人蒐集各方材料，編發所謂「美軍暴行錄」，此外使中共組織滲入新聞界，加強文化宣傳攻勢，增强工人組織，吸收技術人員赴「解放區」等，由此可知周氏赴滬，負有秘密重大使命也。</p>
<h3 id="c5">孫院長談話 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕立法院院長孫科日前由京抵滬，記者昨趨私邸晋謁，談及上海最近曾有少數人發動所謂「響應美軍退出中國週運動」，叩詢有何意見，孫氏稱：美軍撤退決非嚴重問題，第一美軍並無長期駐華之意，第二美軍駐華係經過政府允許，且負有特定任務一俟任務完成自然應當撤退，第三美軍駐華並未干涉中國內政，謂其影響中國主權獨立實無根據。記者再詢以最近曾有若干報紙提出蘇軍留駐旅大問題，是否與美軍駐華同一性質，渠稱按照中蘇友好盟約規定，大連不能駐兵，旅順爲兩國公用之海港，以此而論，蘇軍留駐旅大與美軍駐華，自不能混爲一談。最後，記者叩詢孫氏對常前內政之觀感，渠稱目前財政經濟之所以造成如此現象，係由於行政主管當局政策上之錯誤。</p>
<h3 id="c6">平西香山溫泉並無共軍蹤跡 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>

<p>〔本報南京八日電〕林逆柏生，這東方戈培爾，今天執行槍決了。他直到死還在口血噴人。八日下午一時廿分，老虎橋首都監獄大門口右首，排着一行等待探監的人，但是大家的眼光卻一致注視着在左首一株小松樹下藏賳霖躲閃避着記者羣底照像鏡頭的一個中年婦人，和兩個孩子，婦人梳着髮髻，身穿灰呢旗袍，外罩淺色藏靑毛　外套，足登黃灰色皮鞋，打扮得甚爲乾凈；女孩子有十四五歲，穿着深藍布單旗袍，淺灰色襪，黑力士鞋，漲紅着臉；男孩子有七入歲，穿着淡靑襯衫，藍布工裝褲，黃皮鞋，蹲在地下，玩弄着一個裝雜物的小籐包，不時揉着眼睛，婦人和女孩則不時撫弄着他。</p>
<p>一個法警拿了一張公文，送給那婦人，她看了收下，紅着眼圈，寫了個收條：「收到栽定書一件，林徐瑩，十月八日」。她是林逆柏生底老婆，兩個孩子是她的女兒和外甥。到兩點一刻時，又有兩個婦人坐了黃包車來，怱忙地將哭泣着的她們喊走了，大場在企圖最後努力。但是再過一刻鐘，首都高院的陳羅　　　官到了，從而是一大群記者，原來八日下午是林道柏生底刑期。</p>
<p>二時四十分，在審訊過梅逆思平的簡單公案前，站的是林逆柏生，在法營底挾扶下，他願預地出了監獄，在記者底鏡頭與目光睽睽下，走入臨時公堂，穿一身淺灰派力斯粵式短襠衣褲，灰襪，黑鞋、新理的髮，戴一副克羅米架子的眼鏡，神色自若，矮矮的肥壯身體，鎮靜的立在陳監刑官的面前，微發靑白的臉上，還露着笑容。</p>
<p>一味倔強</p>
<p>「你呌什麽名字？」監刑官問。</p>
<p>「林柏生！」林逆答。</p>
<p>「多大年紀？」</p>
<p>「四十五歲。」</p>
<p>「那裏人？」</p>
<p>「廣東番禺。」</p>
<p>「住在那裏？」</p>
<p>「南京上海路十三號。」</p>
<p>「你是不是爲漢奸案被逮捕的？」(林逆點點頭）。</p>
<p>「你的案子是不是首都高等法院審判的？」(點頭）。</p>
<p>現在我們奉最高法院檢察署轉奉司法行政部訓令，你底死刑要即刻執行，你有沒有遺函？</p>
<p>「有的。」林逆搖搖他手中拿着的一本黑皮書，一本小册頁，一個牛皮紙包。</p>
<p>「好的，你這時心裏要鎭靜一下！」</p>
<p>林逆嘿嘿地奸笑起來，「沒有什麼，沒有什麽，這是國家底事，放心好了，沒有關係，沒有關係，我還有幾個字要寫一寫！」</p>
<p>歪詩可笑</p>
<p>在分開了的另一張公案上，他以行書在那本書底最後一面，寫了一首詩「余要徐瑩及諸兒留念：春去春來有定時，花開花落無　期，人生代謝也如此，殺身成仁何所辭？柏生，十月八日，二時五十五分。」在封底裘面，還寫了兩句口號：「革命救國，科學建國！」那是一本英文的初級微積分。這時，監刑官說：「二點五十五分了！」他寫好之後，述同那一包遺書，一本替別人寫的小册頁，呈繳了上去，然後退下一步，等監刑官問以還有甚麼話沒右時，他又拉拉衣襟，挺挺胸脯，開始了他最後的一段演說：</p>
<p>兩點要求</p>
<p>「我覺得造憾，剛才請我出來時，只說是接見家屬、沒說是執行，使我一點準備也沒有，這是不合法律手續的，雖然不吿訴當事人，也許是怕他們膽小，但是這沒有關係，沒有關係，國家底事，應該公開，我沒有什麽遺產，不過我很放心，因爲家屬討飯也可以活下去。我有兩個請求：第一，是不要像專制時代一樣綑綑綁綁；第二，不要像對梅思平一樣檢騐時把衣服都剪破！」</p>
<p>兩彈畢命</p>
<p>陳監刑官都答應了他，然後拿起了筆，重重地寫下去：「死刑執行！」在名字上下一勾，法警就將他押了出去，他虎虎的踏着梅思平底道路，往前走去，到下午三時零二分，砰然一槍，子彈從後腦打追，天靈蓋上面出來。他仆倒後，還翻了一個身，仰臥在那裏，血從彈孔射出來，但是他並沒死透，還在鄹裏呻吟。呼吸，動彈，嘴裏也不時噴着血。這樣過了一分半鐘，又補一槍，直到三時零八分才氣絕，一幅猙獰模糊的面孔，張開不攏的紅嘴，這東方戈培爾，直到死還在口血噴人。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕旅居新疆三載，此次由迪化經哈密轉渝來滬，擬於十一日出席中央銀行在京舉行第三次業務會議之迪化分行經理馬彥章氏，頃晤記者稱：新疆目前無論在政治，經濟，財政上均有顯著進步，預料不出數載，將由蛻變而趨入現代化階段，以與其他各省媲美。金融方面，法幣流通，幣制穩定，迪化哈密設有中央分行，幷有郵匯儲金匯業局輔之，在勝利前三年，政府抱統一新省幣制決心，按照當時當地物價指數，規定以十元法幣折合一元新幣。且央行積極推動工商匯款，以資貨物交流，金融暢達，綜計今年上半年度，匯出者達一六〇餘億元，匯進者三一四億元。貿易方面，以蘇聯爲對象，過去幷不統制，一時以貨易貨制度甚爲風行，出口以羊毛皮，羊腸，蠶絲，葡萄乾爲大宗，換取者爲製成品及奢侈品，以環境蘊使，人民受蘇聯影響甚深，俄語流行，現値　蘇商業未納入正軌前，走私現象在所難免，本省貿易以夏秋爲旺季，深秋將屈，即陷入冰天雪地，無法營生商民於販賣時，將　　庫粗布運至北疆迪化，換取黃金以蹄。黃金在新本有出產，當地人視之，目爲珍品，其價格追滿米價計之，現値每兩法幣廿八萬元，實際度量衡仍保守一二五折推算，在地方發生不靖時，人民每　携帶黃金出走，故每次時局波動，金價　受影響。馬氏認爲新省前途光明者，確爲物產豐富，蘊藏驚人，在伊犁迪化間島蘇油礦，其質地之佳，世無其匹，若經精鍊，可成飛機油，雖經某方一度破壞，尙不難設法整頓，我政府已注意及此。除迪化爲政治軍事重心外，伊犁更糧產豐饒，米麵成備，爲全省糧庫，煤鐵應有盡有，尤以阿山塔城金礦著者名，其餘各地均有特產，水菓更爲普遍，除天山爲南北疆分嶺外，全省少大山巨川，整理交通幷不艱鉅。</p>

<p>國家大局嚴重極了！和平希望有了一綫光明，又被中共的答覆罩上了陰霾！</p>
<p>我們讀了馬司兩使昨日再度發表的公開聲明，和宋院長昨日抵京後發表的談話，一則以喜，一則以懼。喜的是宋院長所說政府還不放棄和平商談的道路；懼的是周恩來氏的答覆，却又把已可實現的停止張家口戰爭的和平曙光，由他的手來覆上烏云。</p>
<p>政府以前屢次呼籲停戰整軍，中共偏要先談政治，於是而有馬司兩使「五人小組」專商政治問題的建議。等到政府接受了，「五人小組」應該可以立開，而中共却反過來要先談軍事停戰。此一變也。其後五人小組(政治）與三人會議(軍事）爭持不下，政府爲顧全大局，允許「三」「五」同開，政治與軍事雙管齊下，俾爲中國和平求得一痛快解決，應該沒有問題了，詎知中共却又於九月三十日突然發出一個備忘錄，要求政府立刻停攻張家口，否則認爲和談破裂，於是和平之門幾乎堵塞。此二變也。那時，大家都躭憂着，以爲政府勢難允許，中共是故出難題，存心破裂的。本報則於四日社論中，力主「國家大局不容再誤」，呼籲雙方相忍爲國。尤其期望政府「與人爲善」，無論如何，不可閉和談之門，故以爲縱令張家口戰事暫停若千時日，以待一切問題之商談解決，亦無不可。現在馬司兩使聲明，經兩使之建議，蔣主席已同意下令停止向張家口進軍，以十六爲期，在此期間即召開五人小組及三人會議，商討政府十月二日聲明中所提出之兩項讓步限度問題。以常理論，中共前旣要求先停止張家口戰事再談其他，則目前政府已同意張家口停戰十天，中共便該立派代表出席兩種會議，而周恩來氏尤應尅日進京，負責商談。但中共竟又變卦，硬說此項休戰不過是政府的戰略，而且在休戰時期來討論，是在軍事壓迫之下，故周氏無返南京之必要。老實說，政府雖已同意張家口停戰十天，恢復和談，而中共又是拒絕了。些三變也；而此第三變更是出乎意外！</p>
<p>從這一連串的事實來看，政府步步退讓，時時望和，而中共則着着進逼，時時變卦，其欲使和談破裂之企圖已完全暴露了。中共這樣做法，在它自以爲得計，自以爲一旦宣吿破裂，即可自立政府，自找靠山，殊不知違反民意，失了人心，一切事便無從談起。</p>
<p>爲國家計，爲民族計，甚至爲中共自身前途計，我們要誠懇奉勸中共，莫太辜負了國人的期望！</p>

<p>天之驕子揮金如土　物資缺乏求過于供　（俞晶譯）</p>
<p>奢靡風向　普遍全國</p>
<p>因爲精神態度的變更，是這時期的潮流，所以各方面都是現出窮奢極侈的現象。最明顯的例子就是敎會，許多敎堂都已償淸債務，這是敎會史上空前的事實。每逢敎徒集合時，捐款盤內滿滿的都是支票，自願燒燬敎會抵押票據的人非常多。靡費的趨向，首先是運動，足球，籃球，棒球，田徑賽，參加者逐漸增加至打破任何時代之紀錄，美金一百元看一次路易士與康恩的拳擊賽，看客滿不在乎。一個游歷美國的英國胖子布魯斯說：「此地美國的人民整天價在遊玩，他們在甚麼時候作工呢？」</p>
<p>某農村的農夫購買小型飛機在田野間兜風，香檳酒的噴池在歡迎新明星的會塲裏濺射，汽車肇禍也達到新的頂點，連犯罪也超過去年百分之十六。總之，無論甚麼都創着空前紀錄。整個美國各地城市和農村的情形，都受了影響。在雷諾地方人口祗有二萬八千人，一個汽油站在幾年前賣價二萬二千美元，現已漲到三十萬美元。某地農田前五年售價每畝九十美元，現在每畝一百四十美元。有七千多萬人曾保壽險，保障生命的安全。當每一艘遊艇製造出廠時，就有十個顧客訂購。約計美國三千四百萬家庭，有一千四百五十萬萬存款，有一千六百萬萬薪金，需要購八百萬種不同的貨物。</p>
<p>黑市猖獗　漲價變相</p>
<p>黑市的禁令是廿年前就制定，現在却異常猖獗。今年的美國，只要有錢想要什麼就有什麼。譬如買一輛汽車，早已公認必須購買別的零件，這種零件是沒有發票。假使租房子住，每月五十美金的公寓是容易找的，但是房間裘的傢具却售價一千五百美金，只有一張床和一具二十年前的舊燈。</p>
<p>美國人相信這次繁榮，約在十五年後吿一段落，因爲十五年後需要又將改變。究竟十五年後接踵而來的是什麼呢？很少人敢說是穩定的繁榮狀態，很多人認爲必定是「不景氣」狀態。這種普遍的觀念是未必可靠的。他們忽略了種種方面的問題。譬如美國重要的機動工業，足以維持過這個期限，對外的貿易可能增加，人爲的力量可能來避免這種不景氣。最重要的是國家的資源，和需要的規劃，都足以避免這種不景氣的來臨。</p>
<p>因爲美國的公路還需要修理，學校，醫院，橋梁都需要增加，河流的灌溉，洪水的防治，河流港灣的改進，溝渠的裝置，種種設備是無窮的，全國萬人以上的城市一千零七十七座，都需要有完整的市政計劃。還有全世界都需要美國的產物，譬如美國製的火車機關車，訂購的已有一萬萬輛，這種生產只要管制得法，可能使美國平穩地走過十五年的大關。</p>

<p>— 本報質料室</p>
<p>英國商業訪華團，已于昨日從香港飛抵上海，將在滬勾留數日，再轉赴南京·漢口·重慶·濟南·北平·昆明等地一行，預定十一月二十日左右再返上海，然后取道廣州臺灣返國。，他祖任英國商業訪華團的團長。</p>
<p>訪華團的目的</p>
<p>訪華團的目的，是在想獲悉中國一般工商業之眞正情况，以便決定中英二國間未來貿易所應循的途徑，並希望能藉與中國工商界各方面的接觸，而形成若千關於復興計劃的意見，協助中國達到其經濟的平衡。値此中英貿易條約正在進行商談之際，這個商業訪華團的任務，對於將來中英兩國貿易關係的建立上，自然是十分重要的。</p>
<p>團長是運輸問題專家</p>
<p>訪華團一行十二人包括着英國工商界各方面的代表人物，以鮑埃斯爵士爲團長。鮑氏是一位運輸問題的專家，也是英國鐵路機車製浩業的重要人物。他於一八九五年生於南威爾斯，曾參與第一次世界大戰，一九二四年獲牛津大學碩士學位。自一九二九年起，他便担任着國會議員，直至去年。他現在是格那鐵道機車製造廠的董事長兼總經理，格郡車輛修理廠董事畏，格郡煤氣公司副董事長，和許多別的工廠的負責人。以他豐富的學識和經騐，他很早就担任過國際聯盟英國代表團的顧問，並參加過議會的經済訪澳團。這次</p>
<p>七位團員的來歷</p>
<p>和他同來的還有七位團員：貝利士度，是英國糧食部的高級官員，他將特別注重研究中國食物的出口問題；團員蒲司德，是一位電氣工程專家，現任英國電氣製造業協會的出口部主任，去年，我國資源委員會代表團赴英考察時，就是由他担任聯絡接洽之職的；團員毛根，爲威廉漢爾公司的董事，代表英國一般的工業界；團員卡彌高，爲銅業協曾理事，團員史可達，爲普名之圖門鋼鐵公司董事，他們兩人代表英國的金屬工業；團員韓華士，代表一般的英國出口業，團員溫博登，則爲紡織工業專家，此外，尙有代表英國貿易協會的專家湯頓及代表團秘書裴理嘉，裴理嘉曾任商務部長克裏浦斯爵士的私人秘書多年。除時十人外，代表團還有兩位女助理秘書，即路恩絲女士和莫麗星小姐。</p>
<p>看了這張名單，我們就可以知道，訪華團所包括的人物，是代表著交通運輸，電氣工業，金屬工業，舫織工業及進出口貿易等一切部門，那末，這個代表國使命的重要，也就可想耐知了。</p>
<h3 id="c92">汪曼雲審結　辯稱投偽「有功國家」　偽使陳済成　定今日宣判 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕歷任僞駐滿大使，僞僑務委員會委員長，僞邊張委員會委員長等職之陳濟成案，高院已於日前審結，現定今日下午二時半宣判。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕汪曼雲漢奸嫌疑案，昨日下午由高院審結，定本月十五日下午二時半宣判。</p>
<p>按汪前係上海浦東市學校長，於廿八年八月開始投僞，歷任僞社會部副部長，僞司法行政部常務次長，僞農礦部常務次長，僞淸鄕委員會副秘書長，及僞行政院淸鄉事務局長等職。直至勝利爲止。檢察官之起訴書指控汪於僞社會部副部長任內，組織民衆，反抗中央。僞農　部次長任內，增加生產，以物資敵。偽淸鄕委員會副秘書長及僞淸鄉事務局長任內，負肅淸我地下工作人員之責。綜其所爲，應予依法懲治云。</p>
<p>汪昨衣藍綢夾袍，黑緞鞋，在庭上滔滔辯稱：「民國廿八年杜月笙先生致信予我，囑余派人打入偽組織工作，但因當時無人可派，乃自告奮勇，加入偽府，故其動機非常純正，完全出於愛國立塲。旣入偽府任偽社會部副部長時一無民衆可組識，僞司法行政部次長任內，所辦皆例行公事，且不常到部辦公任僞農礦部次長時，正滿目瘡痍，僅有農塲一所供實驗，糧食另有糧食委員會主其事，故根本談不到增加生產資敵。偽淸鄕委員會副秘書長，雖是長，但爲副的長。日常所辦皆秘書部份工作，至</p>
<p>清鄉工作</p>
<p>如何發動等事則不得而知，當時軍事由敵方負責，行政由僞方負責，但僞國府當時係以反共爲對象，淸鄕之行政工作遂亦根據於此，僑淸鄕事務局，係僞行政院內部機構，並非隸屬機關，故無關防，亦無印信，顧名思義，即可知局長係担任事務之責，如依檢察官所指負肅淸地下工作責任，則不應呌淸鄕事務局而應稱作淸鄕局，至各省之淸鄕工作係由各省淸鄕專員單獨負責，故本人之參加僞府，一方面本於奉命，一方面亦係自己</p>
<p>好大喜功</p>
<p>想對國家做一點事根本無通敵之意，出任僞職後其於積極方面所作之工作可分九項之多，如供給情報，已由吳開先氏上次到院作證稱：「他吿訴我，由我轉達中央，除非不送來，送來都是準確的」，故幾年來中央地下工作人員之所以不受威脅，可說全係被吿情報之力量。他如分化李士羣丁默邨兩人，使互相猜疑妒忌，地下工作活動因之得便不少，又如營救萬墨林，吳開先，蔣伯誠等重要地下工作人員，皆有證明。此外如護送杜月笙夫人等赴內地，阻止他人投僞，運送物資入內，參與策反工作，勝利後更協助維持治安工作等，根據種種事實，祇有通謀本國岡謀反抗敵國之行爲，被吿前會別署「兩可兩不可者」，即言身可辱，志不可移，家可毀，國不可亡，故自覺一切無愧於國家」云繼由陳　銳江容兩律師辯護稱：被告在淞滬抗戰後，參與機要工作，之後到過重慶，亦到過香港，但爲何又回上海？此一段故事，已由杜月笙氏前次到院說明。今研究一般漢奸嫌疑案之內情，別之可分兩類，一係有所爲而爲之，即負中央使命之囑托，投入偽府。一係無所爲而爲之，即並無使命而係甘心附逆者。今本案被吿係有所爲而爲之，故應請庭上明察云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕關於逐漸淘汰本市人力車間題，記者昨日往訪公用局長趙曾珏氏，據稱：就時代趨勢而言，就行動效率而論，人力車之應歸淘汰，係勢所必然。趙氏舉例稱：普通之人力車，長約三公尺，闊約一公尺，所佔面積爲三方公尺。倘從拋球塲赴外灘，需時約十五分鐘，其行動效率爲四十五方公尺分，倘乘電車，一人所佔之地位不過一方公尺，從拋球塲至外灘，不過五分鐘，其行動效率僅五方公尺分，相差達九倍之多。就市政建設言：自應提倡公共交通工具，增加行動效率，唯處於目前之社會情况下，淘汰人力車，自有其困難，因公共交通工具尙不如理想之多，各工廠情形亦欠佳，未能容納大量工人，故市政會議曾決定，取締人力軍延至明年一月實施，唯</p>

<p>十月十九日</p>
<p>十月二十日使用車夫之數目登記，十一月中抽籲決定，先淘汰十分之一。失業辜夫，由社會局予以救濟，貸以小本貸款，從事小本經營。據趙局長意見：欲求吸收失業工人及容納復員士兵，可以舉辦公共工程，蓋戰後破壞慘重，一切工程皆待興辦。且開設工廠，原料機器殊多困難，不若公共工程之易於舉辦也。</p>

<p>〔又訊〕社會局已決定分批採用抽籤方式取締人力車，第一批抽出之籤，在尾有「五」字號碼者，概在淘汰之列，預料可取締二千六百餘輛，人力車公會，以人力車取締後，苦力失業勢必增多，而人力車夫，大部份全係蘇北籍，有家歸不得，倘一旦取締，蘇北人民，將更加生活上痛苦，故該公會連日緊急向各政府機關及蘇北難民救濟協會上海市籌募委員會等，請求轉呈當局，暫緩取締，請按照市參議會決定延至民國三十九年起至四十二年止逐漸取締云。</p>

<p>總工會理事長水祥雲對淘汰人力車，表示意見謂：取締人力車有兩個先決條件：（一）人力車夫轉業辦法之妥善解決，（二）疏散本市人力車至其他尙需要人力車之城市。水氏實成組設人力車夫轉業訓練班，訓練其駕駛汽車及修理機件之技能，此項訓練在短期內可奏效，若當局尚未籌有妥當之善後辦法，則望暫緩實行，以免增加失業人數而影響社會安寗。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕財政部爲增募同盟勝利公債，特電上海市政府繼續籌募，略開：「查該市爲全國商業總滙經濟中心，各商在抗戰時期、對於政府業行之各種盟債，多以未能認購爲憾。值茲復員建國，需款孔殷之際，在該市有次發動籌募三十年盟債，自不乏踴躍承購之人。已募之八千萬元，爲數非鉅，似不足以表現其愛國熱忱。茲將債額增爲五億元，除尙未派募之房地產管業人，自由職業紳富等，應予補派外，其已派募之各商業公會，亦應酌予增派。再該市工業界過去對於捐募事項，工人無不首先響應，尤應洽商有關機關協助進行勸募，俾籌募業務得以廣泛展開，用收宏效」。聞常局擬照財政部指示各點，並參酌現實情形，分爲「補派」，「增派，「勸募」三種辦法，邀請市商會及查力雄厚之各同業公會負責人暨各界領袖熱心仕紳，一致踴躍認購。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕行總全體同人，昨晚假逸園飯店，舉行雞尾酒會，歡送新近卸任之蔣廷　氏，並以高二尺餘徑達尺餘之大銀杯一隻，上鐫「棠蔭寰宇」四字，又手卷一卷，贈與蔣氏，以誌去思。出席人數近千，情况極爲熱烈。</p>
<p>首由執行長劉鴻生代表同人致詞，極表惜別之意。繼由聯總駐華辦事處處長艾格頓將軍致詞，苜謙稱到任不久，對善救工作所知尙淺，惟對蔣署長之工作精神，極表欽佩。繼由美援華會潑萊斯女士致詞，亦對蔣氏工作，備加揄揚。</p>
<p>繼之，蔣氏於全塲熱烈掌聲中致答辭，略謂今日承諸君舉行感大歡送，並贈禮物，實不敢當。行總工作艱困，諸君皆係抱服務之精神而來，不惜種種犧牲，本人願在此深致謝意。行總無官塲習氣，凡欲作官者，亦必不至行總也。</p>
<p>蔣氏旋再三諄屬同人，不必存悲覷之心。「若謂中國民族性爲世界最優秀者，固不能稱爲有何根據，惟吾人正不必妄自菲薄證之諸君從事於行總工作之努力，本人惟覺感奮無已。」</p>
<p>蔣氏强調行總工作之重要，謂「吾人之工作成功，則無數同胞之性命可賴以保全，反之，若因吾人之意忽而工作鬆懈，則千千萬萬同胞將因之而淪於溝壑！</p>
<p>蔣氏詞畢後，諸人紛紛趨前與蔣氏握手，表示惜別。記者即以蔣氏行止爲問，蔣氏稱決擬先作二個月之休息，然後再行決定：並以堅決肯定之語氣稱：「我決定回到學校。」</p>
<p>至行總人事，，副署長浦薛鳳辭職照准，由鄭道儒繼任；副署長李車敏辭意仍堅，僅允「維持幾個星期」，聞後任已內定爲吳半農。霍署長昨日並發表陸翰芹爲秘書主任，武冠雄爲秘書，預料日內將續有發表。又霍氏定今日下午三時在都城飯店舉行就任後首次記者招待會。</p>
<p>〔南京八日電〕新近隨蔣廷黻辭職之行總副署長浦薛鳳談：淸華等校近曾來電邀往執敎，惟以偶患微恙，擬略事休息，短期內亦不致離京，至今後著述計劃，將來返校任敎時，或可再度執筆。</p>

<p>廠商陳述困難情形</p>
<p>首由生產商陳述目前困難，（一）爲原料來源不暢，羊毛全需仰給於外國，其價格漫無標準。（二）爲成本之高漲，生活指數直綫上昇，工資開支浩大，利息太高，流動資金缺乏。（三）爲電力之限制，毛絨生產現屆當令耗電總數不過七六一瓩，故要求取消限制。（四）淪陷時期機件損失尙未復元，各廠生產萎縮，不足戰前十分之一。</p>

<p>經售商方面表示淪陷時期，受敵僞限價政策之損失慘重，勝利後受幣制影響，及去年九月二十八日何總司令抑平物似，犧牲尤甚，故要求不作硬性限價。目前該業之威脅，首爲存貨不足，來源不暢，其次爲臨時門售商店投機一時，影　營業。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕菲島華僑羣聲籃球隊，已光榮完成征滬任務，十戰十勝，造成全勝紀錄歸來。昨晚最後一戰，臨別紀念，以卅七比廿八分三敗巨人隊，上半時羣聲以十六比十四佔先。昨晚原定戰巨人恩卡斯之西青聯隊，臨時因恩卡斯　將勃脫染病未能出場，改由清一色之巨人應戰。體育館仍然客滿，熱烈非常，觀衆約五千餘人，軍警童軍維持秩序，上海電台到塲席播，難童敎養所樂隊，昨晚自動到塲吹奏助興。羣聲已定今晨七時由林珠光率領搭車赴京，十三日返此，十四日離滬返菲。</p>
<p>書面顯示沉悶</p>
<p>賽前由羣聲領隊林珠光行贈球儀式，以籃球一只贈與籃委會，由錢旭滄於鼓掌中鴒受。昨賽因羣聲已連戰十塲，不無疲勞，益以傷者纍纍，故戰來不如往日之緊凑得手，精彩乃較往日爲少，局面顯示沉悶，上半時分數甚爲接近，第一節巨人曾以六比一領先，惟大局始終在羣聲控制之下。巨人守衛甚嚴，惜因投籃甚差，屢擲不中，否則形勢或將改變。</p>
<p>羣聲一球佔先</p>
<p>裁判瞿鴻律劉荷生，鳴笛開賽，羣聲蔡文華受傷小休，由陳金德，陳金置，蔡文章，楊人輝，張毓義出塲，巨人以浮尼克，史蒂文遜，凱捷密洛夫，陶勃林基，耶龍臨陣。開賽後，凱捷密洛夫遠射先開紀錄，金置罰中拔回一分，凱捷密洛夫梅開二度，巨人赫然以六對一前領，金德文章雙雙建功增加四分，惟巨人耶龍史蒂文遜三分，成九比五，羣聲呌停，果見張毓義罰人，金德冷飯偸進，追成八比九，未幾第一節即吿終了。再戰聲裏史蒂文遜犯規，楊人輝一罰而入，造成平局，文章妙射，羣聲以十一對九後來居上，繼成各十二兩度平等，楊人輝百步穿楊，羣聲又吿抬頭，陶勃林基中路突破，三造平手，金置籃下竄入，建功而返，迨蔡文華調出陳金德，上半時適吿完畢，十六比十四羣聲佔先一球。</p>
<p>巨人從此落後</p>
<p>休息一過，羣聲以蔡連科巷出陳金置，巨人以强杜萊，沙司金入調耶龍及史蒂文遜，巨人自浮尼克罰球後，即從此不能抬頭，羣聲文章連科文華，迭有建樹，轉瞬即以廿一對十五及廿四對十六遙領，廿六對廿時，羣聲陳金置替出蔡文章，張毓義遙射破網，蔡連科連罰帶擲，邀增三分，巨人一籌莫展，第三節完，卅一對廿，客軍佔優十一分。最後一節，巨人以史蒂文遜耶龍入替沙司金及凱捷密洛央，陳金置首先命中，史蒂文遜罰入，楊人輝籃下托入，比數成卅五對廿一，巨人沙司金調出陶勃林基，此時張毓義五次犯規被黜，陳金德進塲，巨人稍見轉機，比數略爲接近，迨沙司金擲中鐘聲已鳴，羣聲以卅八對廿九克巨人。</p>

<p>— 二日淮陰訊　本報特派員杭舟</p>
<p>「蘇北延安」淮陰的收復，是一件重大的事。在軍事上，蘇北局勢因此澄淸有期，在政治上則赤裸裸地暴露了共黨「解放區」的眞相。</p>
<p>九月廿八日，記者自徐州去淮陰，徐淮公路或許可以說是最壞的一條路。共軍一節節敗退時，把路一節節破壞了。它不愧是破路專家，路被破壞得那樣澈底。國軍發動大批民伕搶修，到現在，路仍像海裏的浪一樣。載重五噸，連本身重量達九噸的六輪大卡軍，似一個醉漢，搖搖擺擺地躡蠕前進，車裏的人無不被顚得頭昏腦脹。</p>
<p>像從煤礦裏出來</p>
<p>北方是風砂的天下。十幾輛大卡車，接連着駛行，後面的彷彿駛行在雲霧裏。常晚抵達宿遷，下了車，人像從煤礦裏出來一樣誹。</p>
<p>宿遷沒有一個可住的地方，房屋大半被破壞了，倖僥剩下的，全住了兵。我只好住到縣政府去，董建華縣長帶着半病的身軀接待我。他吿訴我還鄕以來，縣黨部書記長，縣靑年幽書記都病倒了，希望自已能支持下去。</p>
<p>第二天一早，我再搭車赴泗陽。愈近前方，路愈難走。出產有名的「洋河大麵」的洋河鎭，有一道橋，不能載重，物資卸下來，空車過去再裝上，一上一下，得化兩個鐘頭。時間不經濟，而且隨時有遭受共軍襲擊的可能。前方部隊對於交通錢的不靈活，是最感頭痛的一件事。</p>
<p>放火要犯薛爲賢</p>
<p>到泗陽再歇一晚。大卡車只能到此爲止，再前去，老黃河大橋與運河橋阻攔着，這兩座橋，共軍臨走時縱火燒燬了，放火的名薛爲賢，是一個平民會會長。我在泗陽縣政府的監獄裏看到他他承認是他幹的，但照例地推說是受强迫。兩座橋的損失，簡直無法統計。現在正集中了工兵與民夫在趕修，十月三日可以正式通車。如果不是因爲橋的燒燬，後方補給不上，國軍不會到了兩淮之後暫停前進，而讓共軍方喘息的餘暇。</p>
<p>泗陽遭受損壞的程度，在國軍新近的收復區中，是最嚴重的一縣　　城乎沒有了，新城在河對岸的衆興鎭，亦是殘破不堪。居民寥寥無幾。據統計，城區僅有八千二百人。商業全部停頓，有的只是幾個賣香烟，大餅的攤販。我從江南繁華區來，像回頭走了一個世紀，眞是感不勝感。</p>
<p>騎馬直赴馬頭鎮</p>
<p>大路不通，去淮陰只能走小路。那是走的一條牛車路，因爲軍運的關係，路面已經加寬了，泗陽至南新集可通吉普車。聯合勤務部第十二兵站分監何振明恰好要去視察，我就飛他的吉普車前往。</p>
<p>只有三十五里路，一個半小時便到了。整編二十八師師部駐紥在這兒。副官處派馬送我去淮陰。此去，還有六十里。</p>
<p>吃過午飯，下午二時動身。馬是日本馬，够高大，走路却極慢。馬夫要我用力打它，我又有點放心不下，深怕它發起性來跑得我勒韁不住。於是以一小時十里路的速度前進。到馬頭鎭附近，需要過兩道河，渡船小，河水深，過不去。我要馬回去。踱步到馬頭鎭。一看錶已是六點鐘，距淮陰尙有二十里，兩條腿用多了勁發酸，怎麼也走不快。但我一心要趕到淮陰，在馬鎭一打聽，知道二十八師的一九二旅駐在這兒，訪問了曾振旅長，他除派馬送我外，並派了四個槍兵同去。</p>
<p>風塵僕僕三整天</p>
<p>走不多久，天便黑下來，黑夜是共軍活動的時候，淮陰的城郊並不十分平靖，但我來訪問它。馬蹄聲敲着靑石板，我來到了淮陰的北門。我的興奮掃除了恐懼</p>
<p>淮陰城在戒嚴中，晚上八時以後，禁止通行，爲時已是八點半，經過了幾番交涉，我才進了城。戒嚴眞是嚴密極了。我初到陰陰，便看到了收復淮陰的整編七十四師的將士們執行命令的澈底，我從北門到師部副官處，經過十幾道盤査，化了兩個鐘頭。</p>
<p>從徐州到淮陰，我走了三天，據說是最快的了。黃家駒縣長是步行上任的，他用了更多的時間，淮陰曾經是充滿了神秘性的一個地方，在現在，我將爲你發掘這個秘密。</p>

<h3 id="c169">論華僑商業之勢力與改進（下） <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 丘斌存</p>
<p>（4）緬甸華僑商業之勢力</p>
<p>緬甸華僑，在地理上劃分爲兩部；一爲上緬甸，一爲下緬甸。前者由於鄰近雲南之關係，有陸路可通。經營土木業與寳石業。故移民多屬滇籍，後者由於海路而來，故移民多屬閩粤籍，聚居於伊江與沿海一帶，以仰光爲中心。滇籍約佔百分之三十二，閩籍佔百分之二十八，粤籍佔百分之二十一，其他不特定華僑佔百分之十九。華僑在緬甸有國籍可放的卅五萬餘人，無國籍的華緬混血種又約百萬，合計有一百三十餘萬人，佔全緬總人口十分之一以上。試就緬甸之國際貿易與華僑之商業情形，析述如左：</p>
<p>一緬甸與國際及中國之貿易</p>
<p>現在且將緬甸與國際間及中國之貿易狀况，加以探索。其與國際之情形，我人得以下列數目字表現之；</p>
<p>（一）緬甸與國際之貿易</p>
<p>一九三九至四〇年緬甸對外貿易與所占比率表（單位：千盧比）</p>
<p>觀於前表，可知緬甸與國際之貿易，印度居第一位，英國與其屬領第二位，日本第三位，美與非洲第四位，歐洲與其他各國第五位。</p>
<p>（二）緬甸與中國之貿</p>
<p>至緬甸與中國之對外貿易。自一八六八年起始登入我國海關册，是年爲數爲二千三百四十萬關兩。直至一九〇〇年仍未打破此紀錄。一九〇一年至三〇年漸有進步，高達一億九千九百一十二萬元。一九三三至三四年値世界經濟不景氣，貿易降落。中緬貿易在一九三四年均併入印度統計，後此方獨立一格</p>
<p>茲將一九三六至四〇年緬甸與中國貿易統計列表如下：</p>
<p>緬甸與中國輸出人統計及占中國對外貿總値百分比（單位：國幣千元）</p>
<p>根據右表，應知緬甸與中國之貿易，一向出口超過進口，至一九四〇年後雖有入超傾向，但不少由華進口經緬轉運他國貨物，且七十八年來緬對華貿易地位，均在中國進出口總額百分之一以下。惟此乃指海道貿易而言，其陸路貿易則尙未入關册，難以確計。戰時我國海港被封鎖，滇緬公路繼爲滇越鐵路之國際姊妹路後，據査一九三九至四〇年由緬甸過境循陸輸華貨値有一千九百五十萬盧比</p>
<p>總括前述，我人又可得一正確之觀念：即英美中荷等國所需要之原料頗多須得自總甸供給；反此所出產之製造品亦不少須於緬甸獲得相當之出路。矧日本在緬甸貿易向居第二位。自侵佔後，更築通緬泰鐵路，並在緬强迫施種綿花計劃，一九四二至四三年每年生產一萬七千九百噸，伸合綿布一萬六千方碼。故太平洋戰爭，最先收復緬甸：（一）就我中英美荷盟國方面言，收復緬甸，使彼此經濟互相截長補短。（二）更就爲對日本施行經濟戰爭予以一重大之打擊言，收復緬甸，免除其對緬久施資源之剝奪而苟延殘喘，因以早日潰敗投降。緬甸平時戰時與國際經濟之關係，有如是重要者。</p>
<p>二　華僑之商業</p>
<p>至於緬甸人與華僑就業情形，前者農人口佔總人口三分之一弱。從事原始產業的爲數更多，共計總就業人數是一二，四二二，〇七四人；後者以商工業爲主，商業又倍於工業。至經營之業別以洋雜貨最多。其次是米榖土產各業，茲分別加以說明：</p>
<p>（一）米業：大權握在歐人手中，但內地之販運，則多由華僑經營，其中又以福建人居多，在緬華僑米廠約一百餘所，販榖商號數百餘家。華僑經營米業者，多以利貸與中間商人之地位獲取盈利。</p>
<p>（二）土產業：俗稱爲粗貨商，華僑除以豆類出口爲中心外，包括販賣印度進口之檳榔·烟業·香蕉·牛皮·紅茶等，經營此業者福建人居多，滇省居次，粤人又次之。大城小市都有此類商人之足跡，其中檳榔是本地人日常用品，銷路極廣。但華商或因資本不足，或因不明商情，不能直接辦貨，所以市塲常被印商攘奪。牛皮轉運歐美，獲利頗厚。</p>
<p>（三）雜貨商：經營販賣日常用品，此類商人印商最佔勢力，華僑次之。但華商之普遍性，遠超過印商，經營之物品，爲油·鹽·糖·蒜·辣椒·豆類·海產等日常用品，與國貨如茶·炮竹·荔枝·蠟燭·牙粉等。</p>
<p>（四）洋貨店；販賣疋頭·裝飾品·應用品·中西文具等。</p>
<p>（五）木材商：此類商人多從本地人購買大批森林，或承包斫伐，然後再轉賣給工廠。</p>
<p>（六）藥材店專售中西藥品，醫藥用具等；此類商品，全緬大部份爲華僑與印人所經營，土人經營此業者，幾等於鳳毛麟角。惟華僑與印人相比較，華僑尤佔多數。</p>
<p>（七）鐵器商：共有一百戶左右，因爲歐貨價昂，所以頗受歡迎。</p>
<p>（八）滙兌業：印南一般所謂「批業」。專經營華僑滙款，近來雖然郵局和銀行極力承攬，不過此類商人能代滙款人取得回信，所以僑民頗爲信任。</p>
<p>（九）其他尙有非純粹商業性質者：如（一）便食店—有甜味·餐點，如咖啡·可可·甜茶·糕餅等類，有鹹味·餐點·如麵食·飯食·酒菜等類。（二）工作店—有照相·鑲牙·縫衣·理髮·製鞋·修整機件等類。（三）專賣店—經理當地政府專賣烟·酒·雅片·煤油·及承包典當。屠宰稅務之類。此三種業務，除（一）及（二）之一部份華印緬人均有經營者外；其餘部份幾爲華僑所獨佔。</p>
<p>以上九項中，就華僑本身經營之比例而言，前類（一）項佔百分之一十一，（二）項佔百分之二十，（三）項佔百分之一十七，（四）項佔百分之一十六，（五）項約佔百分之六，（六）佔百分之五，（七）項佔百分之四，（八）項佔百分之三，（九）項佔百分之一十五。</p>
<p>（5）馬來亞華僑商業之勢力</p>
<p>馬來亞華僑二百四十萬人，以閩籍居首位，約佔百分之五十三，粤僑次之，約佔百分之四十一，其他各省華僑共約佔百分之六。馬來亞之新加坡，在地理上以居歐亞交通之衝要關係，形成南洋之第一大埠，各國以之僞貨物吞吐地。新加坡不但爲華僑經濟之中心，在南洋各國華僑對於文化敎育等之推進，乃至對祖國救國賑災等之發動，均恒以新加坡華僑領袖華倫。新加坡在亞洲七大商埠中，亦居於第三位之前列。而馬來亞華僑商業之重要，自不待智者而後知也。按照馬來亞一九三一年普査人口報吿，華僑有職業人口計九十四萬零九百七十二人，佔總人口百分之五五其中經營商業金融人數一十四萬六千八百八十二人，占馬來來華僑總人口百分之八五，亦即占有職業人口百分之一五·六。而據一九三八年新加坡華僑　振總會關査，新加坡一區華僑致力商業種類計有一百一士項，店鋪計有六千七百五十間。且將新加坡華僑經營各類商店與在樹膠商中之地位兩點，分析於下，蘇以映及馬來亞華僑商業之一斑</p>
<p>一　新加坡華僑商店之類別</p>
<p>新加坡華僑商店六千七百六十五間，一百一十業務內，類別之以左列五種爲最多：</p>
<p>五種之中，以什貨商居首位，咖啡商次之，代理牙行又次之。此足以證明華僑商店固多，但屬中間性質。從業籍別之，樹膠，九八行，米業，汽車，磁器，索絡等，多屬閩人。什貨多爲廣府，嘉應人，布疋多爲潮人，咖啡多爲　人，典當多爲大埔客人，皮鞋多爲嘉應人，西藥閩籍參半，中藥多爲廣府客人。</p>
<p>二　新加坡華僑與外僑樹膠商之地位</p>
<p>新加坡樹膠商計有二百二十八家，而華僑所有者一百七十七家，其地位比之英·日·美·荷等國任何家數爲多。茲將其比較列左：</p>
<p>華僑樹膠商店雖較英·日·美·荷等合計家數爲多。惟與其他商店同樣，華僑樹膠商亦多屬中介性質，資本規模，貝難望及外商之肩背。</p>
<p>六東印度華僑商業之勢力</p>
<p>東印度華僑一百四十萬人，以經商居多數，在商業上居中間地位，向東西洋大輪入商「土庫」購進商品轉售與本地人，同時向本地人收購土產轉售與歐·美·日輸出商「土庫，」取百一之利。至直接經營輸入出「土庫」者，究屬少數，多者爲中小商人，尤以零售爲最多。不特通都大邑有華僑零售商人，甚至窮鄉僻壤，只須有人居處，無不有其蹤跡。力量之普遍，殆無倫比。爰將東印華一僑之投資所得分爲兩點述之如下：</p>
<p>一　華僑之投資</p>
<p>一　華僑與外人投資之比較</p>
<p>華僑在東印之投資，據一九二一年赫爾費米（Helffeinih）調查，各國在東印投資，荷蘭佔七三％居第一位，華僑佔一〇％居第二位，英國佔九％居第三位，日本佔一％。以現在眼光觀察，雖不免陳舊，亦可見當時之狀况，與華僑投資之基礎。</p>
<p>二　華僑之商業投資</p>
<p>前項赫氏調査華僑投資，或因當日調査之未巡，或以華僑投資隨時代之演進而有增加，故其統計只可作爲東印度華僑投資之初步基礎，而不能作爲定論。近年調査東印華僑在各種商業部門投資狀况：以所投資本言，華僑土產商資本在十萬盾以上者有一千五百家，布疋商資本在五萬盾以上者有六百家，什貨商資本在五萬盾以上者有一千二百五十家，其他普通商資本在一萬盾以上者有五十家，一千盾以上者八家，統計東印華僑商業財富在七萬九千二百五十萬盾左右。至於東印華僑在各商業上活動之籍別，概括而言，閩籍多營土產，粵籍多營什貨。再分析之，漳泉人多營土產·魚·米·布疋，樹膠廠，油廠，客人多營什貨，酒酪，鞋店，首飾，縫衣。長汀人多營藥材。廣東人多營酒店，飲食，攝影，土木，機器工塲。潮州人多經營農業與菜園。</p>
<p>三　華僑之資產與所得</p>
<p>據荷印中央統計局報吿：一九三七年華僑擁有二萬五千盾至一百萬盾之資產者共有三千零七十九人，計共資產爲二億四千二百萬盾。一九三八年减爲二千六百八十四人，資產總額亦减爲二億二千萬盾。至普通華僑每月收入以四十盾至一百五十盾間。更根據一九三八年荷印中央統計局報吿，華僑年中所得入息與人數有如下數字：　單位：　（盾）</p>
<p>年中所得入息數目　人數</p>
<p>九〇〇——一，〇〇〇　三，六三一</p>
<p>一，〇〇〇——一，二〇〇　五，八一一</p>
<p>一，二〇〇——一，五〇〇　八，二六二</p>
<p>一，五〇〇——二，〇〇〇　八，六二七</p>
<p>二，〇〇〇——二，五〇〇〇　五，〇九五</p>
<p>二，五〇〇——三，〇〇〇　三，〇〇八</p>
<p>三，〇〇〇——四，〇〇〇　三，七三八</p>
<p>四，〇〇〇——五，〇〇〇　一，九〇〇</p>
<p>五，〇〇〇——六，〇〇〇　一，〇九七</p>
<p>六，〇〇〇——八，〇〇〇　一，二〇九</p>
<p>八，〇〇〇——一〇，〇〇〇　五四四</p>
<p>一〇，〇〇〇　一二，〇〇〇　三一八</p>
<p>一二，〇〇〇——一五，〇〇〇　二七〇</p>
<p>一五，〇〇〇——二〇，〇〇〇　一九六</p>
<p>二〇，〇〇〇——二五，〇〇〇　八五</p>
<p>二五，〇〇〇——三〇，〇〇〇　八五</p>
<p>三〇，〇〇〇——四〇，〇〇〇　五五</p>
<p>四〇，〇〇〇——五〇，〇〇〇　一八</p>
<p>五〇，〇〇〇——六〇，〇〇〇　一二</p>
<p>六〇，〇〇〇——八〇，〇〇〇　一五</p>
<p>八〇，〇〇〇—一〇〇，〇〇〇　三</p>
<p>一〇〇，〇〇〇—一二〇，〇〇〇　二</p>
<p>一二〇，〇〇〇以上　一</p>
<p>總計　三，九五五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>前表祇限中產以上華僑年內所得入息，中產以下　　入息，未有列人。據估計全印華僑胞所得入息至少有五十億產。</p>
<p>東印度華僑半數以上經商，荷印首任總督柯恩（Jan　Picterson　Coan）謂：「華僑最爲勤勞，爲吾人城市中不可或少之民族。」伽噸（W．J．Katon）論華僑經濟地位稱：「由於華僑勤勞節儉及善於經商，不但對於將來荷印社會有利，且爲不可缺少之份子。」平時羅僑對於東印城市之建設，山野之開發，旣不無其勞績；而二次世界大戰，華僑更協助荷蘭盟軍與當地人士，共同抵抗日軍，盟國凱旋，日本敗降後，中荷平等新約經於去年五月廿九日在倫敦簽訂，於同年十二月五日在重慶正式互換批准約本。所望東印政府與當地人士，當了解華僑之勤勞節儉，爲易與及可與相處之人，而刮目相看，勿動輒壓迫華僑，彼此互相「給予締約他方人民以進出其領土之權利，曁在該領土全境內旅行，居住，及經商之權利，」使華僑安居樂業，而兩國之經濟關係，尤爲密切與進步。</p>
<p>三　華僑商業之改進準則</p>
<p>由上所述，應可窺知華僑在長處方面，固具勤勞節儉之條件，致其商業勢力鞏固立於不敗之境地，在短處方面，華僑商業顯而易見只居中間性之地位，缺乏現代大企業之嚴密組織與科學管理，只恃個人各自爲謀，堅苦卓絕奮鬥，而少有集思廣益，羣策羣力，同心合作之精神，諸如國家之維護，資金之通融等，均嫌未有。故華僑人數固多，經商天才亦超越，卒祇能作中介之商人，而未克爲具有獨特性握得商塲牛耳之大商家。經營商業，應該經營大規模之大商業大企業，不宜從事於小商業；做商人應做居商塲重鎭之大商家，不宜做較量錙銖之小商人。今後發揮華僑之長處，針貶華僑之短處，改進華僑之商業，應從左述三個準則做去：</p>
<p>一　國家方面</p>
<p>一，應有專責機構與幹練人員，指導華僑投資。</p>
<p>二，保護民族資本，採取保育政策。</p>
<p>三，改善華僑在居留地法律地位之平等，及促成華僑參加所在地地方政治之活動。</p>
<p>四，提高中國國際地位，改善中國對外經濟關係，爭取華僑在南洋經濟發展之均等機會。</p>
<p>五，國家貸款協助重往海外，特別是再赴南洋華僑，向外發展經濟事業。</p>
<p>二　華僑方面</p>
<p>一，促進華僑經濟合資合作全作：（一）性質方面—减少零售商，改營生產事業。（二）集中原則中集中零星資本成爲生產事業資本。（三）利用辦法—利用游資，集中生產。（四）合作之道—促進人才及技術合作。</p>
<p>二，改善經營方式：（一）改獨資或少數合夥方式爲現代企業組織。（二）建立華僑金融流通機構。（三）直接辦理國際貿易，改進華僑中間商地位。（四）認識外人經濟審業之弱點，力謀發展我人之優點；並以國民外交之良好態度，善與當地人士相處，增進彼此之感情。</p>
<p>三　配合與聯繫方面</p>
<p>一，華僑投資航業，協助政府發展國外交通事業。</p>
<p>二，利用華洋豐饒物資，彌補國內資源之缺乏。</p>
<p>三，推銷中國生產製成品及物資向外發展</p>
<p>四，將中國工業化後之過乘人口，向南洋移殖，發展華僑經濟事業。</p>
<p>五，國外經濟事業，在無害於其發展之條件下，以其餘資向國內投資，發展組國生產建設事業。</p>
<p>六，求取國內外人材技術之合作調劑。</p>
<p>七，資本上之互助合作，發展官商合作經營事業。</p>
<p>八，國家與華僑相互協助，發展國際貿易。</p>
<p>總而言之，今後爲謀推進華僑之經濟商業，不可不從下列各點着想：</p>
<p>一，戰後南洋經濟事業之發展，應放棄過去自由放任之主義，而與國內經濟建設密切配合。</p>
<p>二，華僑經濟事業上個人主義之自由競爭方式，應大加改進，以達成保護僑民事業之目的。</p>
<p>三，政府應從外交途徑，爭取華僑之平等待遇。</p>
<p>四，政府應供給技術人才，並予華僑以適當之指導。</p>
<p>五，華僑經濟事業，經戰時之破壞與敵人掠奪，戰後應視事實需要，由政府用切實敏捷之方法貸款協助其復員，復興與發展。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c170">德境英美佔區經濟合倂　對抗蘇聯的擴展　英美每年所費逾四萬萬元 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯自世界報告週刊　　溪</p>
<p>德國英美兩佔領區現正準備着實行經濟上的合併。英美兩國目前所化費於德國的代價每年約二十億元。兩佔領區實行合併以後，英美兩國納稅人的負擔當可弒輕百分之三十。但是實行合併以後的德國，非經過數年以後，不能達到自給自足的地步。</p>
<p>合併的眞正目的其實是政治的，無非欲　蘇聯知道：廢除一切界限而把德國在經濟上打成一片，是對於蘇聯有利無弊的。蘇聯可以和德國西部佔領區隔離，而靜待機會，它希望德國所加於英美人的負擔將使他們不耐久待，或竟至退出德國，果爾則德國全部將人於共產黨和蘇聯的掌握了。</p>
<p>蘇聯靜候機會，並無什麽困難。在四個佔領區中，只有蘇聯區纔有剩餘食糧，一九三九年的剩餘食糧超過二·六五四·〇〇〇噸以上。蘇聯所恐懼的便是英美不管費用怎樣浩大，仍照預定計劃進行，把德國造成一個非產主　的國家·其經濟力量遠較蘇聯佔領區爲大</p>
<p>美國佔領區　官長克萊對於英美佔領區的合併表示意見稱：「合併的主要理由是需要。美國佔領區在經濟上並不自給自足，但是對於其他佔領區有很多的貢獻。英美兩區合併後，可使德人自戰爭結束以來初次獲得謀生的機會」。</p>
<p>德國被割裂成四部份以後，完全失却了經濟活動的機能，這種經濟上的癱　狀態增加了英美納稅人的重大的負擔，合併的目的就在減輕這一種病態。</p>
<p>英美兩國給養和管理各該佔領區每年的費用計美國二萬萬元，英國二萬二千萬元，此外尙須加上佔領費用。在各强國間的猜疑沒有消除以前，在德國能在列强監督下實行經濟上的自給自足以前，英美軍隊不能照預定計劃　减至最低數額</p>
<p>據英方估計：駐德英軍三十五萬人，全年的薪津總額計四萬三千萬元，食糧和其他維持費不計在內。英國軍人的俸給遠不及美國軍人的豐厚，英國士兵的年俸平均約二千七百元，美國士兵約六千元。美國佔領區內三十一萬五千人的每年維持費，尙無確實估計，但是即使把每人的全部費用减爲三千元，總數當在十億元左右。</p>
<p>在此可驚的數字（英美合計已超過二十億元以上）以外，尙有因德國問題延不解決造成歐洲其他部分的經濟紊亂，使英美所蒙受的不可計數的損失。要是沒有分裂的德國加重歐洲的負累，那麽耗用於救濟工作和借款的數十億美元·常可大爲節省。</p>
<p>預料英美兩區實行合併以後六個月內，對於外界物資來源的依賴可以逐漸减少。目前已有幾種利益可以得到，英國能够供給充分的烟煤及熟煤。砂礫·燐酸肥料·生鐵。半鐵·成鋼·建築用鋼及鐵路材料</p>
<p>美國佔領區在政治上較英國佔領區進步，美人監督下的德人握有實權，而英國區內的德人只處於顧問的地位。爲了配合此情勢，英國將給予德國官吏以更大的權力。</p>
<p>兩佔領區共同開發經濟資源，可以增强力量，以抵抗通貨膨脹，倘蘇聯堅決反對恢復德國的生產力時，便須利用這新生的力量。</p>
<p>美國專家三人所草擬的財政計劃現正由克萊推進中，該計劃主張將不可避免的戰費及戰敗的代價平均分攤於德國人民，計劃中的新貨幣和資本稅及財產稅將適用於德國全部。倘蘇聯拒絕此項計劃，英美將單獨在合併區域內建立財政制度。</p>
<p>兩區合併後將實行標準配給制，初時擬將美佔領區十內　人的配給量酌予减少，使與英國區內德人的配給量相等。但目前豐收有望，或可將英國區的記給量增加使與美國區的配給量相等。</p>
<p>本年度英國區內甘薯的收穫可達九百萬噸，較去年的五百餘萬噸幾增一倍。美國區內的收成亦有增加。倘魯爾區內礦工的糧食配給可能增加，則假定有三十六萬礦工作，每日可達三十萬噸的生產量。</p>
<p>英美兩佔領區的合併，指示蘇聯和法國在「競爭」和「合夥」的兩種辦法中選擇一種。事實上經濟合併與農事改進可使英美納稅人的全年負担减輕百分之三十。這是相當可觀的節省。但專家們承認英美佔領區的合併不過是一種權宜之計，其目的蓋欲使法蘇合作，致力於全德國的經濟統一，使列强均蒙其利。</p>
<h3 id="c171">外弛內張的世局 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>口頭說和平，但戒備未懈</p>
<p>自史達林呼籲和平之後，到處充滿了戰爭論調的世界，頓時有獲得澄淸的轉機。美國與論界對於史氏的談話，雖然非常冷淡，但是甫抵柏林的艾帥，却首先表示相信　蘇必能與英美合作，年高德劭的前國務卿赫爾，在他垂危的病榻，也向列强呼籲和平。同時美國國務卿貝爾納斯在巴黎發表談話，響應史達林的談話，也表示不相信「新的戰爭」即將爆發，對於解除德國武裝，又將廿五年條約改爲四十年條約。杜魯門總統並在華府表示贊成貝爾納斯的政策。以爲奧援，諭理國際局勢可望因此而趨緩和了；但是巴黎和會的結果，不僅沒有消除英美與蘇聯間的矛盾，反而使其裂痕比較以前更加深刻。因此世人的視綫，又集中在三巨頭會晤的傳說上了。</p>
<p>所以這一星期的世界局勢，外弛內張，悅耳動聽的和平呼聲，對於世界和平的締造，有沒有實效，還要　各國的實際行動而定呢！</p>
<p>英美戒備有增無減</p>
<p>美國海軍留駐地中海，已引起了各國的不安；大家均迫切地期待着美國當局的決定。海軍部長福萊斯特使發表聲明，謂美國海軍留駐地中海有兩大目的：（一）接濟歐洲各佔領區內盟國佔領軍之軍需，並協助盟國軍政府履行其佔領任務；（二）保護美國利益，以及支持美國政策。同時杜魯門總統又向記者說明美國對太平洋現有基地之政策：（一）保持關島與塞班島，作爲西太平洋美國防務之中心；（二）在琉球·特魯克·及其他島嶼，設立次要基地；（三）在菲律賓亦將設立基地；（四）在阿拉斯加附近之柯台克島，現正設立鞏固基地，以供美國海軍使用。接着美國陸長柏德遜更率直地說，美國應保持强大的軍隊，常備軍應有陸軍七十師空軍廿七大隊，其任務有二：（一）佔領歐洲及太平洋之敵國領土，以確保盟國之勝利；（二）遇有襲擊美國任何企圖時，常備軍應立即予以痛擊。</p>
<p>此外，美國飛行家伊爾文上校，駕了超級空中堡壘「夢舟」號，自檀香山直飛開羅，當試成功，對於美國朱來防務，將有異乎尋常的重大貢獻。</p>
<p>英閣改組　統一軍事</p>
<p>英國內閣改組的傳說由來已久，終於在四日宣佈了。這次改組的特色，最惹人注意的有二。第一，英國內閣添設國防部，統一英國的軍事機構，由海相亞力山大出任大臣，對於英國的國防，實爲一重大的革新。英國此舉，傳說已久，陸軍參謀長蒙哥馬利元帥上月初前往華府，考察美國軍事組織時，就表示英國亦將依照美國的體系，改組英國的軍事機構，俾能便利英美將來在軍事上合作，所以英國內閣添設國防部，實在是應付「未來的戰爭，」的準備工作。第二，英國這次內閣改組，起用了好幾個年靑有爲的少壯派，外次麥克尼爾的升任國務大臣，尤爲各方所歡迎。今日的工黨內閣，實爲世界上最富於朝氣的內閣。不過工黨的元老派，大半仍留在內閣中，故一般性的施政方針，不致有何變動，其重點仍在國營政策上，俾能改善國民的經濟生活。但是保守黨大會，正在英國的黑池城開會，邱吉爾便認爲機會難得，乃發表演說，猛烈抨擊工黨政府。謂工黨爲其一黨的政治利益，不惜破壞國家的統一，而未能保持英國在國際上所應處的地位。這種論調常能引起一部份英人的共鳴，但是工黨處在曰夾縫裏，道路愈走愈狹，確需要在苦悶中求得一條出路。</p>

<p>— 世界週報阿根廷特派員報告　　南</p>
<p>阿根廷和美國在政治上的不睦，差不多已經有五年了，但是最近兩國的關係，顯然在蛻變中。阿根廷總統貝隆和美國駐阿大使梅塞史密斯屢次舉行會議的結果，差不多把許多主要的異議都解決了，並且已經到了發表公開聲明的階段。</p>
<p>一且兩國間的協定宣吿成立，就可以進而討論美洲聯防和美國訓練以及部份配備阿根廷國防軍的計劃了。</p>
<p>「世界週報」阿京特派員雷特蒙報吿說：阿根廷首都外交各界人士均信對共產主義的憂慮，乃促使兩國和諧的一個重要因素</p>
<p>大家都祀得在今年六月間，貝隆對於蘇聯的商務代表團特別優渥款待，當時蘇聯報紙對蘇阿關係的好轉曾大事煊染，可是現在他却特別重視　塞史密斯了，外交界節爲這種　變、　　頗爲深長。</p>
<p>三種困難　接近解決</p>
<p>美阿間的困難問題事實上已有好幾點接近解決：（一）對於先前德國人所有的工商企業，正在加緊統制。（二）停閉德國學校即將宣吿結束；（三）驅逐許多德國人出國的工作，業已完成，包括德國袖珍戰艦「斯比上將」號的船員在內。</p>
<p>但是還有兩點使美國感到不滿：（一）阿根廷對於察浦忒拍克和墨西哥城的泛美協定遲遲未予批准，貝隆在當選總統之後雖說阿根廷國會必須加以通過，但是截至目前尙未有所行動，這使美國官方不解何故；（二）德國潛勢力的存在，也是美國所担心的。最使美國納悶的一點，就是美方認爲是納粹份子而貝隆認爲密友的德國富商弗勒特，自稱已經獲得阿根廷國籍。美國主張弗勒特這輩人的國籍應予以取消，並將其驟逐出國。但截至目前，尙未定奪</p>
<p>可是美阿兩國不致因此而不能獲得協議，因爲美洲其他國家都希望恢復已往友好的關係。</p>
<p>協定成立之後　召開軍事會議</p>
<p>協定的第一部份，大致將爲軍事性質的，衆料阿根廷將要求美國派遣軍事代表團，猶如美國派往其他拉丁美洲從事軍訓工作的軍事代表團一樣。因此美國的軍規和訓練方式，可以代替該國目前使用的德國軍規和訓練方式。現在已有美國海軍顧問和空軍代表團在阿根廷了。</p>
<p>此外，美國可以供給有限數量的武器和配備，藉以代替自歐洲得來的陳舊器械。阿根廷陸海空軍的軍官，可以到美國軍官學校中去攻讀，猶如其他拉丁美洲國家的軍官一樣。</p>
<p>協定成立之後並可使泛美會議提早在巴西京城召開共同商討西半球的防務，以防侵略。巴西政府希望這個因美阿不睦而屢次延期的會議，能在十一月間召開</p>
<p>阿根廷已往曾經是泛美會議的叛徒。外交界預料這一次在巴西京城舉行的會議，可以試騐出阿根廷究竟能和美洲其他國家合作至若何程度。</p>

<p>〔本報巴黎九月廿六日通訊〕到過巴黎的中國人，大槪也都到過里昂站附近小巷中的一家浙江小麵館去吃過餛飩或炒麵。這麵館很小，佈置也不　　，門前又不掛牌子，生客很難找到，生意淸淡原屬意中之爭。祇因它所做的餛飩和炒麵，是十足地道地中國手法，所以在巴黎的僑胞，總願意招待你去領略一趟這故鄕口味。像這樣的小館子，在這小巷附近，共有五六家，營業一樣不振，一樣步着末落的命運，除了住在附近的少數僑胞爲經常顧客外，很少有法國人光顧的。但要知道法國大部華僑生活實况的，可以到這裏去調査。嚴格講來，這算不得是一項正式營業，祇是幾個失業流落在海外浙江靑田縣人，大家來帮一手忙，做點零落的生意，糊口飯吃的。　提起在法國的靑田人，很多人自然會想起徒步經過西伯利亞，越過烏拉爾山，沿途依賴賣石爲生的一羣充滿浪漫氣氛的冒險者。記者也是受了這個浪漫故事的吸引，利用停留在巴黎的短促期間，特地去訪問了這羣青田人好幾次，希望獲得一點他們親口叙述的故事材料，報道國人。但是經過幾次調査後，方知靠賣靑田石步行到歐洲的人，已經是老一代的舊事，親身經歷的人，至今已死的死，病的病，能够找尋出來的遺老，在巴黎祇有四個人了。即是這四位碩果僅存的冒險家，今日皆已病廢衰老，行動很不自如，記者作了好幾次訪問的約會，都未如願，實在是個很大的遺憾。現在住在這小巷附近的四百餘靑田人，雖同樣爲了生活的逼迫逃到這異域來尋條活路，但經歷遠不如前一代人的轟烈。所以在他們中間，沒有値得歌頌的浪漫的冒險故事，祇有一點受生活煎熬，異族虐待的悲慘經歷，也許能够引起好心腸人的矜憐，而博不到崇拜英雄的人的欽慕。</p>
<p>在法國的華僑，（指在法國謀生的中國人，而非今天飛來，明天飛去的達官貴人），據說共約二千人，以廣東人和浙江靑田人居多數。其中住在巴黎的約八百人，廣東人和浙江人數目相埓，彼此因住處不同，謀生方法不同，平常很少往來。廣東人似較善於經營，所以廣東人中，間有小康之家的，現在巴黎的幾家像樣的中國菜館，除申江樂園外、都是廣東人開的。浙江人幾乎全是靑田人，全住在里昂站附近一帶的小巷中，差不多一律赤貧。雖然也勉强支撑着五六家麵館，但生意都很零落，很難維持一家人的開支。他們到法國的時間，參次不一，在記者所曾談話過的二十餘人中，其中最早的一人，到法國已滿十八年，最遲的一人，也已十一年。所以來時正是年少氣盛，冒險心甚强的壯年，至今則漸露衰老，不免要想到故國了。來時動機不一，大槪都是從上海坐船、到法國來做勞工的。法國承第一次大戰以後，勞工缺乏，需要在海外招致，而靑田人則因受前一代賣石人的宣傳，紛紛到法國來冒險了。十餘年來，從手上到口裏，勉强維持生活，其中比較幸運而又稍能節省的，都已娶了法國老婆，據他們吿訴記者，現在巴黎成家的，約有半數，大多已生有孩子，最大的已滿十八歲，現在法國學校中讀書，算是法國人了。自大戰結束後，最近契眷回家者共三十餘人，顯然是他們這　中最幸運的，受着同儕的欣慕羨妬。現在仍留法國的，旣然沒有回國的川資，同時回國後也沒有謀生的把握，所以祇好仍殘留在法國，過一日算一日。</p>
<p>法方限制嚴</p>
<p>在德軍佔領期間，德人對於僑胞，到並不過分歧視虐迫，做小買賣，開小飯館的仍聽其繼續營業，在工廠中做工因工廠停閉而失業的人，也改做小買賣，生活也還能勉强過去。據說在德軍佔領期間，僑胞中死於德軍之手者，並無一人。惟有一次法國匪徒，曾來搶刧一家小麵館，因起爭執，致有僑胞一人，爲匪徒槍死，兇手至今沒有緝獲，案件至今沒有了結。不渦德軍曾徵用華工，到巴黎附近去築防禦工事，有二次遭盟機襲擊，共死僑胞三十餘人，一九四○年德國令維希政府，派送壯丁至德國服役，維希當局，曾微僑胞去充數，已經送至柏林，但因德國當局，堅持祇要法國人，因此，已送去的僑胞，又送回法境，得以安全無事。</p>
<p>現在法國復興後，工廠紛紛復業，一部份僑胞，又回工廠去了。每日工資，約爲三百法郞（合美金六七毛），僅够個人餬口。因爲多數僑胞，看不懂法文，無法學習或担任比較精巧專門的工作，工資是高不了的。其餘的人，靠做點皮帶皮夾之類，在街上兜賣，每天也可以賺四五百法郞。他們最感覺痛苦的，是在法國無諭經商或做工，都要向法國政府去領到許可證，否則偸偷地幹着，如被查到，必受車罰。而這些僑胞，到法國時，護照就未辦得淸淸楚楚，而於法國的現行制度法令，又茫無頭緒；因此，動輙得咎受罰。當地留學生，出一張油印中文報，華僑對於國情的認識，全靠這份報紙。他們也知道中國現在是五大國之一了，因此曾派人到大使館去請求過，要求使館和法當局交涉，發給僑胞做工，或經商的許可證，但我們目前在巴黎的使館，對於這批窮苦僑胞的請求，根本不注意，所以今平三月間，他們曾開過一個會，決定送呈文四件到國內，一呈蔣主席，一呈宋院長，一呈王部長，另一則以同鄕關係，送呈陳辭修部長，請求救濟，並請令飭大使館予以協助，辦理求業的許可證。宋部長與王部長的覆信，很早就來，都說已另函大使館相機辦理。僑胞方面，另從使館方面打聽到，宋王的信，果已於四月間送到大使館，但大使館並無絲亳舉動，此次王部長因歐洲和會，親到巴黎，僑胞曾派代表去面陳實况，九月三日，巴黎華僑，開會慶祝我國勝利節，那天晚上，僑胞又乘機請王部長蒞會致訓，使王部長實際一見華僑社會的機會，督促使館努力交涉，以後情形，或則可望好轉些。</p>
<p>現在巴黎的華僑，對於是吾想回祖國一事，意見不同，大概在國內尙有弟兄姊妹的人、都想回去省視一下，所以都在盼望有回國的機會。反之，則以爲如能在法國找到工作，每日賺三四百法郞，則生活雖苦，至少尙不至挨餓。他們在離國之前，都已飽嘗渦失業之苦，不信此次回去，必有較好的運氣。即縱在國內找到工作報酬待遇，皆趕不上在法國，所以寗願在法國繼續工作，這二種希望，都是根據事實而來的，當局如能對這批僑胞，有所幫助，二條路似乎可以同時並進。</p>

<p>— 華林</p>
<p>人生要滿足自己的幸福，是不可能的，只能『美』化人生，以超越精神，打破一切現實的枷鎖，以前進勇氣，逃脫一切生活的苦悶！悲劇的人生，不應當再痛苦了！我們應當快樂，應當歡笑，應當歌唱跳舞，我們在寂寞的山頂呼嘯，我們在狂海的潮頭游泳，我們玩索痛苦的滋味，做我們歌唱的資料，我們跳入黑暗的深淵，做我們人間的游戲，尼采說：「有大慾望的人們，有大的輕蔑，有大的厭惡，」要療治悲觀主義，應以超越與前進的快樂精神克服之！所以他提倡「超人」，人到最大的失望時，會產生最大的新希望！</p>
<p>「彌蓋浪」的斜陽雕塑，是個男像，他轉身要閉緊眼睛，不願看當時內亂的恐怖情形，希望是死了，僅存留點紀念：居友在哲學詩中也說過，我隨我的路途，走去遙遠的前程，那黎明的光輝，美麗的將來，是我寶貴的生侖！爲什麼是這樣溫情，因爲他還遙遠，足見只有希望是甜蜜的！他又說：「最高的快樂，幾乎流下淚來！」這種超越的感情，都是含了許多痛苦，尼采也說過「要認識最大的快樂，必先認識最大的痛苦，」居友也有同樣的感慨，他說認眞造成痛苦。也許淪於死亡，任憑他如何，我眼睛總是正視着！</p>
<p>悲劇的樂觀主義：就是以超越精神，使人生不陷於墮落與囚獄，以前進勇氣，逃脫了現實的縛束與苦悶！歡呼罷！歌唱罷！生出兩翼來跳舞罷！在水上跳，在火上跌，在人間一切寃獄上跳！踏着宇宙的節奏，領略人間的游戲，我的陰影招呼我，籠罩着我，他把我陷入黑暗的深淵，但是我能離開他，逃脫他，救出了自己，因爲我有極大的輕蔑，極大的厭惡，我昂起頭來，舉起手來，兩腿也隨着跳起來，好像生出兩翼，飛到高山巔，飛到遙遠的晨星，我俯首向着深淵微笑，智慧的哲人，總是在那裏笑！「笑！」如同一個天真的兒童！</p>
<h3 id="c175">在快鏡頭下 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 捷克·却貝克著　江思譯</p>
<p>趕飛蛾</p>
<p>一個人手裏拿着一本書或是一張報紙坐着；突然，他抬起頭來，游目追望着空中的什麼东西，好像望着一幅看不見的照相似的。接着他跳了起來，用手抓了一把，此後就跪了下來，用手掌拍了一下地。他又跳了起來，用手抓着空虛；奔到一個角隅去，一邊拍着他的手；拍了一下牆，然後小心地看着自己的手。接着無可奈何地搖着頭，而走過去又坐了下來，懷疑地望着他剛纔拍過一下的那一個角隅。三秒鐘之後，他又一躍而起，跳到空中，擊着手掌，倒在地上，打着牆壁和傢具，發狂地挥動着他的臂膊，跳來跳去，頭转来轉去，然後又坐了下來。五秒鐘之梭，他又跳了起來，把這儀式一般的跳舞又重頭至尾表演了一次。</p>
<p>迫電車</p>
<p>這一件事，你須得要有一輛剛要開出去的電車。在這個時候，一個是到停車站去的人掉過頭去，開始把他的腿更快地活動着，動作像一把剪刀似的；此後他像　戏一般地輕跳着，接着就跑慢步，一邊還微笑着，好像這樣做不過是玩玩而已。接着，他一手按住帽子，開始竭力奔跑了。那輛當時的確等過一會兒的電車，現在開足速率開出去了。那追電车的人絕望地奔跑了幾步，而那電車却隆隆地毫不關心地馳過去了。這時候，那追電車的人下了這樣的一個結論：他趕不上那輛電車了，他的熱情崩潰而消失了；他帶着沒力的奔跳向前跑了幾步，然後停了下來，在那已去的電車從面揮着手，好像是說：『沒有關係，你到地獄去也儘便，走吧！我可以等第二輛電車——比你更好一點！』</p>
<p>牽狗散步。</p>
<p>一個牽狗散步的人，往往自以爲他索着狗，而不是狗拉着他。如果那隻狗要嗅一下什麼東西，牠的主人也停了步子，望着週圍的建築物或是自然景象；而當那隻狗爬下來大小便的時侯（這樣做便是降低他的主人的身份了），牠的主人便慢慢地燃起一根紙烟，或是表示出他正需要在此地逗留一會兒，表示他正在凝想什麼事情，竟一點不知道他的狗这时在做什麽。</p>
<p>顛躓</p>
<p>一個人踏着了什麽東西滑了一下，或是爲了什麼完全外來的理由突然變更了他的步伐的韻律。他往往驚愕地揮動他的臂膊，好像要抓住什麼人似地，忽然用那最失體面的忽忙，去重獲他的失去的平衡。但是他一這樣做了之後，他就帶着一種顯著而有精力的敏捷繼續走着，好像對一切過路的人說：『喂，你們在呆看什麽？你們以爲我要跌一交嗎？嘿，我沒有跌，可是這又和你們有什麼關係呢？難道你們不看見，我現在這樣大踏步走着嗎？」</p>
<p>避泥濘</p>
<p>一个踏过泥水潭的人實在是這樣幹的。他先站在潭邊想一個方法不弄濕脚越過那水潭；接着他輕輕地跨着步子，像一隻貓似地，祇用他的脚尖兒踏地；此後他聚精會神．在水潭中跳着，改變方向，非常小心地前進；然而，出乎他意料之外的，他恰巧踏在泥潔的最深最骯髒之處。那時這個想避開泥濘的人，便表現出一種喊「啊喲」的面目；他頹然地停止了一會兒，然後從泥水潭的最深之處掙扎出來。在長長的旅程中，像人生的旅程一樣，這叫做安命。</p>

<p>— 戚廓</p>
<p>寫字間裏最容易無聊，忙的時候大家喊人手不夠，再不添人要請假回家看娘舅去了；閑的時候，大家都是冗員，彷彿一個寫字間裏祇需要三五個人便可以應付裕如。</p>
<p>於是大家便不嚷了，眼看着那三五個人低着頭忙公事，餘外的自己想法排遣自己的時光</p>
<p>最考究书法的老梁第一個由鉛絲簏裏抽出一張公事用箋把小字笔濃濃的蘸飽墨，用心的默寫起他最得意的「金剛經」來：</p>
<p>「如是我聞，佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園……」</p>
<p>這是他最偉大的發明，寫小字一來陶冶性情，二來可以瞞瞞上司的眼睛，別人都在那裏扯閑天，祇有老梁，老梁總是俯着身子一筆一劃的寫，像煞有公事做，說不定比那三五位正在忙着公事的先生們還忙。</p>
<p>別人自然免不了由抽屜中抽出一本半本的方型周報之類，給目己一點輕鬆，可也都悶聲不响的不擾別人，祇有小王和小李，兩個最年輕，也最浮囂，把脚往寫字檯上一翹，天南海北，專門談寫字間裏的新聞，也不知道那裏來的那麼多。談的愛談，聽的愛聽，誰也不追究來源，反正排遺過時光再說。</p>
<p>小王說：</p>
<p>「小李，薛科長艷福來了，新近弄上一個妞兒，是一個歌女……」</p>
<p>「唔！」</p>
<p>小李爲着要聽清楚一點，把身子一歪，翹在寫字檯上的脚和椅子失去了重心，一下子歪到坐在背後的老梁的身上，老梁正在寫：</p>
<p>「乞，食訖……」</p>
<p>那訖字的尾巴就被曳得老長老長，像一隻狐狸曳着尾巴在雪地裏跑。老梁就怪不高興，拿起那張公事用箋，翻過身去，指給小李看：</p>
<p>「你看看，好好的一張金剛經……年輕輕的不留點口德，專門談別人的隱私……」</p>
<p>小李就拍手打脚的笑起來：</p>
<p>「我曉得，老梁，咱們倆人心照，我不談你的就是！」</p>
<p>老梁扳着臉：</p>
<p>「我？大丈夫坐得正，立得正，不怕你談！」</p>
<p>小李忙不迭的點着頭：</p>
<p>「得得得，算我多說，昨天在福利公司門口，……噯……我不說，我不說……」</p>
<p>「呸！」</p>
<p>老梁在痰盂中吐一口吐沫，就又坐端身體，由鉛絲麓中重新抽出一張公事用箋來：</p>
<p>「人祇要坐得正，立得正，·…嗯。…」</p>
<p>把小字筆在墨盒上蘸飽，就又重新默起他的金剛經來！</p>
<p>「如是我聞，佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園……」</p>
<p>老梁饒得了小李，小王可饒不了小李，努力的探過頭來，扯着小李的袖子，低聲的問：</p>
<p>「什麼？小李，什麼？老梁的蘿曼斯？……」</p>
<p>小李假裝的把衣袖扯開，擺得怪正經的：</p>
<p>「沒有什麼，答應別人的，不講，君子協定！」</p>
<p>爲難的是小王和小李也有君子協定，所以小李就祇好低低的說：</p>
<p>「其實也沒有什麼，昨天我看見老梁陪着一位年輕小姐在大光明門口……」</p>
<p>還沒有說完小王就跳了起來</p>
<p>「大新聞，老梁君子人也。……囉！……」</p>
<p>有這麽一個大新聞裝在肚子裏，小王簡直就蹩不住，他撇開了小李，在寫字間裏儘兜圈子，兜呀兜的，湊到張方的耳邊：</p>
<p>「老梁有了蘿蔓史，昨天勾上一個漂亮Girl在大光明看電影。」</p>
<p>張方笑起來，抬起頭望望那正在寫金剛經的老梁背影，有點不相信，那樣的老成人？</p>
<p>「眞的？」</p>
<p>小王把胸脯一拍：</p>
<p>「哄你？小李親見的！」</p>
<p>坐在張方對面岳道明好奇的湊過來：</p>
<p>「什麼事，什麼事？」</p>
<p>小王把大姆指一挑：</p>
<p>「你去問他！」自己又兜呀兜的兜到別處去了。</p>
<p>張方使勁的把頭湊到岳道明那邊，輕聲的說：</p>
<p>「老梁那君子人也玩起女人來了。昨天有人看見他陪着一個怪漂亮的小娘們，怪親熱的在大光明看電影。」</p>
<p>「看完電影呢？」</p>
<p>「國際飯店吃夜飯也說不定，誰知道……」</p>
<p>岳道明含着一肚子的笑轉過頭去，拍拍嚴體智的肩膀：</p>
<p>「老梁這人可真得刮目相看了，昨天有人看見他熱哄哄的摟着一個漂亮小娘們在大光明看電影，看完電影還到國際飯云店吃飯，喔！」</p>
<p>嚴體智吐吐舌頭。</p>
<p>「不保險，不保險，「國際飯店你跟他進去的？」</p>
<p>岳道明搖搖頭；嚴體智就怪得意：</p>
<p>「不就是，你保他不是開房</p>
<p>他再也坐不住，扔下正捧在手中的小報，把椅子拖到旁邊的寫字台去：</p>
<p>「阿黃，阿黃，我報告你一個消息，你知這老染這人？」</p>
<p>「那是君子人，整天就知這寫金剛經。」</p>
<p>那個吐吐舌頭！</p>
<p>「現在可有了羅曼史了，昨天他和一個小娘們在大光明看電影，兩個人摟着，唔，說不定還開司來着，看完電影又到國際飯店開房間。……」</p>
<p>阿黃把頭轉向老梁那邊看看，又撥向另一角：老徐正坐在那邊打算盤，不知道是算官帳還是算私帳。阿黃就一本正經的扳着脸走过去！</p>
<p>「老徐，我有件事和你談談</p>
<p>老徐忙把算盘推到一邊：</p>
<p>「请教，请教……」</p>
<p>「你那个姐丈有外遇了，昨天有人看見……嗯……在國際飯店……咱們是疎不問親，不過呢，你得勸勸他，他這幾年君子人的名聲不容易……」</p>
<p>老徐沒有等到下寫字間的時候就走了。等到老梁回家的時侯，梁太太正伏在床上哭，老徐坐在那裏唉聲嘆氣，看見老梁就無精打彩的嘆一口氣：</p>
<p>「姐夫你也太不對，你和我姐姐結婚十幾年……」</p>
<p>梁太太突的由床上跳起來：</p>
<p>「你不用和他說，他做得出來我也做得出來，我和他拚了」</p>
<p>一頭撞在老梁身上，兩個人跌在地板上，震得地板山響。</p>
<p>老梁的姪女由隔壁的小房間奔過來說：</p>
<p>「叔叔嬸嬸都不要生氣，剛才的話我都聽見了，沒有的事，昨天下午寂叔陪我去買東西，一下午我都和叔叔在一起，回來也是叔叔陪我回來的，回來以後叔叔就沒有再出家門，嬸嬸也知道的」。</p>
<p>灶披間裏的飯已經燒焦了，一股焦香冒上樓來。</p>

<p>第五章　突入魔窟</p>
<p>當晚（七·二十八日）臨從長辛店動身時，我又把〇四號呌來，重再吩咐了他應當處理的事，呌他設法儘量辦得妥當。事完，可到北平來找我，又把地點告訴了他，省得多費功夫探索。</p>
<p>這時北平四郊，一共三四十里的圈子內，可說十分紊亂，槍聲砲聲，狂嘶亂吼，好幾處正冒着烟火。入城的一條路上，有的一段冷靜得如同古道，有的一段，哨探住來如同穿梭，喊着口令的　喝，夾着槍聲，同時迸發；昏朦朦的夜色裏，沿路不時可以看到威羣的男女老幼，在路旁邊，像鬼影憧憧般，提着沉重的脚步，向他們認爲安全的方向走去，嘆息之聲，雜着小兒的哭啼。</p>
<p>十點多點，我又回到w君的總部。這時，大概事忙，他的辦公室中，多了兩位收訊人員，一個應接電話，一個在收發秘密電訊。我把長辛店的經過，簡單說了兩句；請他儘速指點一個方法，可以安置鼎元的問題。這並非因我不熟悉北平的情形，實際上，我是把鼎元的整個負担，放在他的身上；因爲我立時就得動身上通縣去了。w君略不躊躇，當即命人把鼎元送到協和醫院去，他說在短時期內，看情形再想辦法。</p>
<p>他把北平的情勢，也簡要的告訴了我—宋哲元已到涿州，二十九軍未遭犧牲的將領，也跟着他撤退，張自忠現在城內，總理軍政的重担，天津由李文田負貴—他說「司惜這種措置，辦理得太嫌晚了一點，白白犧牲了許多將士和平民。」</p>
<p>我把上通縣的問題提出，請他派一部車和兩位助手同行。他都照辦，並提到了幾點應當注意的事。他說通縣全境就是一個地獄，假如「地獄」的含義有這麼混亂·可怖·然暗·悽慘·從北平到通縣這麼四十多里路，沿路都有日偽的魔手，隨地攫奪。屠殺。通縣城內，節直是一個鬼怪世界，眼睛不亮，步步都是荊棘。陷阱。</p>
<p>「無論從政治或人道的立塲看，我們得盡所有的力量，把牠翻過身來。」w君沉着的說，「可惜了一點……我們本來預計今大早晨，趁日人「拂曉攻擊」之前，實行預期擬定的動作，搗亂小鬼的後綫，打滅他們的興頭。這在軍事土也不無相當的效果；可惜耀羣和小老虎去得晚了一天，佈置上差了一點時間。」</p>
<p>我這時一邊躺在軟椅上休息，吃點飲食，恢復體力，一邊聽他說話。聽他提到耀羣和小老虎的事，我立刻坐了起來，想問他幾句話。</p>
<p>w君立即伸　作勢虛按一按說，「　還是躺着休息罷，我知道您要說什麼—您以爲耀羣和小老虎，这麼年肯的兩個孩子，他們的行動，怎麼有這大關係，怎麼去遲了一天，連全部的行動，都要延遲一來？這樣，我們的秘密工作，簡直有些兒戲意味，不是嗎？」他說到這裏，馬上在文件樹衷，檢出了兩封信來：</p>
<h3 id="c180">麥幹呂脫　渥𡛥 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 大椿</p>
<p>麥幹呂脫·渥𡛥（Marguerite　Audoux）小時候就失了父母，在一個孤兒院裏由女教士教養起來。出孤兒院後，在沙駱岸（Sologne）的一家農莊裏當牧羊女。後來到巴黎去做裁縫。一九一〇年左右，將她幼年的經歷，做工的生活，以淡泊而感人的寫實文體著成兩部自傳體的小說，就是瑪麗·克萊（Marie　Claire）和瑪麗。克萊的工作室（L'atelier　de　Marie　Ctaire）。處女作瑪麗·克萊出版後，立刻驚動了文壇，米爾博（Mirbeau）認爲一本傑作。因而於一九一〇年得到法國「番密娜文學獎金」（Prix　Femina），該書迄今銷售去十餘萬本。瑪麗。克萊威功之後，她就獨自住在蒙派奶斯區的洛槃路（Leopold　Robert）上一所小屋的頂樓裏，一直到死前的最後幾個月。</p>
<p>渥　深知道爲了生活，必須艱辛地工作，所以，從此她日以繼夜地著作起來，一方面還可以解除自己的寂寞。她一共過了三十年的文字生活。她的出現於文壇，實似閃電那樣的突如其來。她的使命是在我們中間散布那件希有的東西：純潔。米爾博曾經朝她說：</p>
<p>「你，你是一位天使！」</p>
<p>這句話並不過分，她在那所貧苦的小屋裏，常常以一片慈心接待一切來訪的人：她的朋友，大作家，大藝術家，或無名小卒。那些人初到她那裏時，總覺得重壓着倦怠，懊喪。但聽了她的談話，看了她的面貌，他們漸漸地感到輕鬆起來，覺得一切都洗拭掉了。她往往先將小餐室內窗前的青帘揭開，指着點綴窗櫺的那些花盆，用可口的沙駱岸音調向來客說：「先请看看我的花園！然後我們再閒談。」</p>
<p>在冬天，一隻心形的小火燼「在她底寫字檯旁發着鼾聲。她一邊在「小心」中拌火，一邊將一隻柳木大靠椅——這是她唯一的好靠椅——讓朋友坐，自己坐在旁邊，微笑着說：</p>
<p>『请讲你所有的小苦楚罷。』而清晰，一口和諧的佳句。當斐立普（Charles-Louis　Philippe），雨騰（Francis　Jourdain），米爾博和其他許多作家看到了她底一再塗改的練習簿，欣賞了她的作品，都驚奇不止。不禁會那樣的問：這種文章，這樣的筆調，是誰敎給這位女裁縫的？</p>
<p>渥　對於這種奇怪的問題，如此回答：「我一點不知道！我一點沒有學習！但我在一生中曾經很利害地夢想！</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>這里舉出一個小故事，來慰勉我們的外勤同業。</p>
<p>那是一九四四年夏季在美國佛士尼亞洲溫泉所舉行的一次聯合國糧食會議。會議在五月十八日舉行，事前決定各國代表均不得接見新聞記者，並且限制新開記者不得入代表們所下榻的家園飯店。這一決定當然引起了各國記者的抗議，紐約時報便很眞率地指責「這將造成惡劣的先例」，……經過了記者的要求，美國國會的辯論，以及大多數報紙社評的抗議，最後，美國官方終於讓步了，取消了那些禁例。</p>
<p>自由不會從天下掉下來的，須爭取，如果我們的新聞自由並未妨害到他人的自由，我們決計可以爭取到自由的。聯合國糧食會議不過是千萬例子中其一而已。</p>

<h3 id="c182">說謊偵查機 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 旅人</p>
<p>據十月五日申報載：警察局近在榮德生氏致送獎金中，擬劃出一部份作爲添置刑事警察設備，其中有一新設備，即爲說謊偵察機。該機在偵查案犯之時可立刻辨別所供是否屬實云。所謂說謊偵察機，自一九二一年在美國加州白克萊警局第一次試用以來，到現在已具有十幾年以上的歷史，因它的協助，而使警界人員縮小了偵察的範圍，節省了不少的時間金錢和精力，故己成爲歐美警局普遍的刑事設備，不過在這世界都市的上海，還是初次擬在添置中而已。這裏將它的原理構造和用途，作一個簡要的介紹：</p>
<p>假話說不得</p>
<p>說謊偵察機並非是個神奇的東西，它不過是一個紀錄人類身體變化的機器而已，正像醫生診病時用的溫度計聽胸器一樣，在偵査罪犯時，可以根據它的紀錄，而斷定犯罪者所說的話是否屬實，因爲人類的身體變化，是隨着撒謊者的情緒變化而起的。古時中國人訊問嫌疑犯時，往往給他一些米粉，要他咀嚼之後吐出來，要是吐出來的米粉是乾的便認爲有罪。一百年前，美國的獄吏康倫，對於中國人訊問犯人的這種方法，加以學理上的證明：康倫以狗來試騐，發現恐懼，忿怒的痛苦均能使唾液在內臟中的蠕行完全停止，不能流入口腔，雖然將米粉含住口中很久，仍舊不會潮濕。現在的說謊偵察機，就是根據這個原理而發明的。</p>
<p>現在的說謊偵察機的構造，計分三個部份：一部份量出並且紀錄被檢查者的呼吸，一部份紀錄脈膊速率和血壓的變化，另一部份量出在皮膚的皮相抵抗中，微妙的電變化。這些身體的變化可以同時紀錄在一張移動的紙上，這張紙是用一種電動機（其正常速度與電流頻率恰成正比）推動的，每一部份都是一個獨立單位，可以單獨行動。這三部份聯合行動起來，便造成所謂說謊偵察幾。</p>
<p>說謊偵察機所紀錄出來的結果，經過工作人員一番明確的解釋，便可以斷定被偵査人所說的話是否確實。所以一個使用說謊偵察機的工作人員，必須有精密的頭腦，冷靜的觀察，再經過極嚴格的訓練，方能如意地運用這種靈巧的機器，正像一個良好的醫生所應具有的條件一樣。</p>
<p>不打竟自招</p>
<p>說謊偵察機的用途，眞是非常廣大：它可以尋找被竊財物，它可以檢騐別處正拿在捕的漏網逃犯，它可以釋放無辜而被牽連的人，它可以帮忙檢査證人，看他的證據是否確實，它可以帮助警士，找出正犯，它可以調查殺妻而反向警局報稱妻子被殺的奸滑的犯人，它可以調査那些盜賣倉庫而以一把火了之的貪污者。</p>
<p>白克萊警局第一次用說謊偵察機來破案的，是一件謀殺案：白克萊城的一個年輕的姑娘被殺了，從吿種跡象看來，可以斷定是件情殺案子，警局把所有認爲嫌疑的人犯，一併拘進局內，個別訊間，始終不能找出兇犯是誰，只好乞靈於當時新發明的說謊偵察機，先受檢騐的幾個人身體上都沒有犯罪的反應，輪到第九個人受檢驗後，說謊偵察機上所繪出的圖證明他有罪。他們把記錄給他看，他直認不諱的招供了。要是用普通偵察法來解決這件案子，恐怕要費時費力得多。並且，在這種情形之下，如果沒有說謊偵察機，實際上這件案子恐怕也不能如此容易解決。</p>
<h3 id="c183">關於鋼絲灌音 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 非然</p>
<p>在今日報上（六日申報）見到中國出口貨展覽會特請陳德良先生講「鋼絲錄音」一節，我就想起了些關於這鋼絲灌音的一些事！</p>
<p>我國這鋼絲灌音是剛由陳德良先生發明成功的，眞是我國科學界的異彩！</p>
<p>但是這鋼絲灌音，在美國早已有了，可是他們祗是軍用，而且保守了極大的秘密，不肯吐露半點消息出來，所以爲了這一點，陳先生自己親自把它創造起來。</p>
<p>其實鋼絲灌音的原理，在五十年前已有丹　人　爾生Poulsgo發明，但是當時防人注意它，直至第二次世界大戰才有蘇聯靑年甘拉士Camras在美國正式發明，創造成功，眞是在灌音科學上起了一大革命。</p>
<p>現在，灌音方法有三種：一種是機動的，就是目前最普遍的一種唱片，它把音灌在臘片上的，但是牠用過幾遍後就損壞了，而且牠的一切機件很是笨重，在有種塲所上不方便，而且祇能灌三分鐘之時間。第二種是光學的，這一類大都是川在有聲影片上的，它是在軟片旁邊一條細細的影子，可是經過了光射和電　的作用而放出音來，當然價格也是很貴。第三種就是鋼絲灌音了，也呌磁性灌音。它祗靠了一條極細的鋼，但是它並不是普通的鋼絲，是經過了一種强弱不同的磁性而成的，待它放音時祗須把這鋼重新裝入電磁鐵的兩極中間，用大槪每秒二尺的速度，這樣再經過放大器就可發出音來，而且音是很淸晰。同時，灌了一次音可以重復用廿萬次仍是不變，還是很淸晰；甚至於不要時乃可以經過磁化的方法來把它自動退去，再作第二次灌音。</p>
<p>總之這種方法可以等於黑板上寫的白字，而且用起來便當而迅速。例如某要人在某地演說，當時便可把它收下來，立刻可以拿至廣播台上把它播出，用不到再重複做什麽板子，而且至少可發音達一小時以上。</p>
<p>所以在這次舊金山和平會議上一切都利用這鋼絲濯音成爲記錄。</p>

<p>讀十月六日本報自由談欄加另君的「一睡卅九年」一文後，我不禁憶起了求學時曾聽到的一段趣話「一睡一世紀」我的同學說：「公元一九九九年十二月三十一日晚上十二時以前睡覺，睡到第二天起來，已是公元二〇〇〇年一月一日，那麽他不是從廿世紀睡到二十一世紀嗎？」</p>

<p>據說：香港政府也在閙經濟恐慌？</p>
<p>九月二十三日，香港華商總會例會中，曾討論「港府增加稅收」一個問題，飲食業同業的代表袁見成，即席提了一個「政府收入可以增加，商人負担不致加重，市塲繁榮也不受影饗」的一個辦法——開徵「納妾稅」。</p>
<p>袁某還有補充意見：「我提議凡是納妾的，每人應繳稅兩萬元，多納多徵，如是，則港府旣可廣稅源，一般人又不致增加負祖，豈不是兩全其美？</p>
<p>聽袁君的說話，似乎頗有把握，香港到底是「高等華人」薈萃的塲所，納妾不過像購汽車，置洋房一樣，算不上一回事，儘管祖國災區賣妻鬻兒，自己何妨三妻兩妾。所以，袁先生有先見之明，恐防走漏稅款，特地加以補充：「多納多徵」。</p>
<p>可是香港畢竟是半變色的香港，不然的話，我們的「護馬」諸公，大可以做一下文章：「人家利用納妾而抽稅，我們爲何不可靠賽馬而征捐！」</p>

<p>— 戴爾·加耐基著　莊文冶譯</p>
<p>約翰·洛克費勒（John　　Rockefeller）一生曾經作了三件令人驚異的事蹟：</p>
<p>第一件，洛氏初出茅廬時，是一個每小時工資僅四分錢的佃農，但他終於成功了一個「王」，一切史跡中積資最多的人。當時全美百萬的富翁，尙不及六人；而洛氏一人所積的資財就有十萬萬至二十萬萬美金之多。</p>
<p>第二件，洛氏所捐出的款數，較歷史上任何人爲多；從降生到他逝世時止，共捐了七萬五千萬美金，平均一晝一夜的每一分鐘，都有七角五分錢捐款的支出。</p>
<p>第三件，洛氏壽命之長，竟達到九十有七的高齡，就世上有百萬資財的白種人中能活到九十七歲的，僅三十人。而到這高齡，口裏不須假牙的，這三十人中恐怕再也找不出第二個人來；洛氏却在他九十七歲時，口裏一粒假牙，仍都沒有。</p>
<p>長壽有術</p>
<p>他延年益壽的秘訣是什麽呢？大槪是天賦給予他長壽的一種傾向吧！或許這種傾向是由於他恬靜的頭腦，以及溫和的性情所造成的。他一生從未激怒過，也從未急燥過。常他總理美孚公司時，至他百老滙二十六號的辦公室裏，安放着一張臥榻，每當中午，他總在這榻上假寐半小時；每天假寐五六次，這樣繼續不輟的實行，死而後已。</p>
<p>洛氏五十五歲時，體力漸衰，豈知這正是醫藥界有史以來的唯一福音呢；因　　身體的不適，而激動了他捐款給醫藥界，以爲探討醫藥學術的經費，每日在全部洛氏基金裏，差不多要提出應百萬美金，藉以改善人顚的健康。</p>
<p>一九三二年夏季，霍亂蔓延於中國境內，時作者適在中國，那知在這貧病交迫的國度裏，居然也能踏進以洛氏基金所創辦的北平協和醫院裏去注射防疫針。這才知道，即使在亞洲或地球上極遠的一個角落裏，都有着洛氏善舉的痕跡。</p>
<p>保鏢護衛</p>
<p>洛氏雖然如此行善，但他却是全美最被人痛恨的一個，接到恐嚇危害他生命的信件，前後不下數千起，是以不得不有保鏢的日夜防範和保衛。雖處在這令人毛髮悚然及身遭危境的情緒中，他仍能從容不迫的料理和擘劃遠大的企業。</p>
<p>洛氏朱曾受過大學敎育，在他十六歲受業了中等敎育，再人商業學校讀了幾個月以後，永沒有求學的機會了；然而他却慷慨解囊，以五千萬美金的捐款，贈給芝加哥大學作經費。</p>
<p>他確是一個令人敬佩的人物，少年時代，就矢志不賭博，不吸烟，不飲酒，不跳舞，不看戲，以致成功了大實業家的地位。</p>
<p>回憶青春</p>
<p>洛氏以他產業的發達，是以資財亦繼之不輟的增加，每分鐘裏，差不多要有一百元美金左右的進益。而洛氏唯一的大志願，不是資財的增加，却是竭盼他能够有循環一世紀的長壽命。他說他若能舉行百歲生辰大慶於一九三九年七月八日，他必在他的田產裏鮑卡替訶山（Pocantico　Hills）上，領導一支樂隊，指揮他們吹奏一只「回憶靑春」（When　you　and　I　Were　Young）的樂曲。可惜他在一九三六年即去世了，不然的話，倒又是一番大熱鬧呢！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Ma Marshall Issues Public Statement: The Chinese Communists Reject the Cessation of Hostilities at Zhangjiakou, and Peaceful Negotiations Face Another Setback <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Song, issued the following statement at 8:00 PM on the 8th: After months of stalemate in negotiations between the government and the Chinese Communists, two suggestions were successively put forward in an attempt to break the deadlock: (1) Ambassador Stuart suggested forming an informal five-person group to discuss the reorganization of the National Government to allow the participation of the Chinese Communists, but the Chinese Communists rejected it; (2) The government then proposed, in addition to convening the five-person group, also convening a three-person conference to discuss the issue of army reorganization, with the aim of quickly stopping military conflicts. The Chinese Communists did not respond to this proposal. On October 8th, General Ma informed the representatives of the Chinese Communists that Chairman Chiang was willing to halt the advance toward Zhangjiakou for a period of ten days, during which the two key issues of political and military reorganization would be discussed. The Chinese Communists have now rejected this new suggestion, which is deeply regrettable. However, the government still hopes to continue negotiations to seek a peaceful resolution to the Chinese Communist issue.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 8th] Following the public statement issued by Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart on the afternoon of the 8th, our newspaper's reporter paid a special visit to Ambassador Stuart at 7:00 PM to request a statement from him in his role as a mediator. He graciously received the reporter and stated briefly that the purpose of issuing the public statement was to make the entire Chinese people aware of the content of the peace talks. General Marshall and he had not added any personal opinions but wanted to leave room for readers to make their own judgments. Regarding the progress of the peace talks, the Ambassador provided a detailed analysis of the mediation efforts since the beginning of the month, believing that the government side was sincerely seeking peace and hoping for a ceasefire. He stated that initially everyone acknowledged cooperation, and they believed that if the reorganization of the National Government Committee could be established, all problems could be resolved step by step. For example, regarding the issue of the military mediation department’s executive team entering the area within the ten-day ceasefire period proposed by the government, the Chinese Communists feared that government personnel would be active everywhere. They were willing to take responsibility for it. The government was earnestly hoping for a ceasefire, but now there has been another change. As for the ceasefire guarantee demanded by the Chinese Communists, General Marshall and he declared that they would do their best to guarantee it. Their hopes were high because they knew that the government wanted a ceasefire and also wanted a democratic government, as did the Chinese Communists. However, such negotiations must not be approached with excessive suspicion, lest they lead to a tragic outcome. Finally, the Ambassador solemnly told the reporter that if there was any possibility of saving the situation, they would still do their best and were still awaiting a response from the Communist Party. The Ambassador's tone was somber today. Although the reporter was in a luxurious living room, he could not help but feel as if he were facing an abyss. The Ambassador ultimately did not deny the seriousness of the current situation but believed that if there was any room for maneuver, he would still do his best. After the reporter shook hands with him to say goodbye, they went directly to General Marshall's residence to celebrate Mrs. Marshall's birthday.</p>
<p>Text of Marshall-Stuart Statement</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart issued a public statement on the 8th, the text of which is as follows: "On the morning of October 1st, General Marshall received a memorandum dated September 30th from Zhou Enlai in Shanghai via Communist representative Wang Bingnan, outlining various activities of the Kuomintang. It concluded by saying: 'I am now instructed to inform you of the following facts and request that you convey them to the government side: If the Kuomintang government does not cease its military operations against Zhangjiakou and its vicinity, the Chinese Communists will be forced to assume that the government has publicly declared a complete rupture and finally abandoned its declared policy of peaceful resolution. The responsibility for all serious consequences arising from this state of affairs shall naturally be borne entirely by the government side.'"</p>
<p>"At General Zhou Enlai's request, the aforementioned memorandum was forwarded to Chairman Chiang. On October 2nd, the Chairman replied to General Marshall with a memorandum citing certain hostile actions by Communist troops. In this memorandum, the Chairman suggested that, in order to save time and demonstrate the government's sincerity, the government would make the following maximum concessions to resolve the current issues:"</p>
<p>"(1) The Chinese Communists have repeatedly urged the reorganization of the National Government, and the key to the reorganization is the allocation of seats. The government originally agreed to 8 seats for the Chinese Communists and 4 seats for the Democratic League, totaling 12 seats, within the National Government Committee. The Chinese Communists demanded 10 seats for the Chinese Communists and 4 seats for the Democratic League, totaling 14 seats. The government now makes a compromise concession of 8 seats for the Chinese Communists, 4 seats for the Democratic League, and 1 seat from the non-party seats, recommended by the Chinese Communists, totaling 13 seats with government agreement. The Chinese Communists should immediately submit the list of Chinese Communist members of the National Government Committee and the list of their representatives to the National Assembly. However, this agreement should be negotiated by the informal five-person group and then submitted to the Comprehensive Group for agreement."</p>
<p>"(2) In order to effectively implement the army reorganization plan, the garrison locations of the Chinese Communist's 18 divisions should be quickly determined, and they should enter the garrison locations in accordance with the prescribed time limit. This decision should be formally agreed upon by the three-person conference and then submitted to the Military Mediation Executive Department for supervision and implementation."</p>
<p>"If the Chinese Communists are truly sincere in peaceful cooperation and willing to quickly resolve these two issues, then both sides should immediately announce the cessation of military operations upon reaching an agreement."</p>
<p>"This notification was immediately conveyed to the Communist representatives, and the Communist representatives visited the American mediators within the same week, requesting clarification as to whether the Committee Chairman's memorandum of October 2nd was a response to Zhou Enlai's memorandum of September 30th, as it did not mention Zhangjiakou."</p>
<p>"Subsequently, the Committee Chairman, General Marshall, and Ambassador Stuart held several discussions. As a result, the Committee Chairman agreed to order a halt to the advance towards Zhangjiakou for ten days. During these ten days, the five-person group and the three-person group would hold meetings to consider the two suggestions made by the Committee Chairman on October 2nd. The Committee Chairman also agreed that, during this truce period, the Executive Headquarters would convene an executive team at various key points to investigate whether the truce agreement was being observed. However, within the Communist army's front lines, government representatives would not accompany the executive team. Executive teams would also be stationed between the Kuomintang and Communist armies, with representatives from both sides participating. In addition, the American representatives would have the right to decide where and when the executive team would proceed, and the representative himself would report any actions that he believed violated the truce agreement. The Committee Chairman also agreed that the truce communiqué would be issued by the American mediators, and both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would avoid issuing any communiqués."</p>
<p>"This news was delivered to Communist representative Wang Bingnan on October 6th at 1:30 PM, to be forwarded to General Zhou Enlai in Shanghai."</p>
<p>"Today (Tuesday, October 8th), Mr. Wang Bingnan verbally conveyed the response from Zhou Enlai in Yan'an, the content of which is as follows:"</p>
<p>"(1) The truce should be indefinite, as experience has shown that nothing else will be satisfactory. Unless our government demonstrates its sincerity and withdraws its troops to their original positions, the above suggestion seems to be merely a strategic ploy."</p>
<p>"(2) The Communist Party is very eager for the three-person and five-person groups to convene meetings, but the scope of discussion should not be limited to the two paragraphs in the Committee Chairman's memorandum of October 2nd. The topics involved in the ceasefire state can be considered as being under military duress."</p>
<p>"(3) There was no response to the memorandum of October 2nd because the Communist Party was very eager for General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart to clarify the situation for achieving peace."</p>
<p>"The recent suggestion shows that the situation has not changed significantly. Therefore, General Zhou is prepared to submit a written reply and believes that there is no need to return to Nanjing for the time being."</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Government Hopes Zhou Enlai Will Return to Nanjing to Participate in Negotiations; Liang Shuming Expresses Astonishment at the Communist Party's Response <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 8th] The Communist Party's response, which had been awaited by all parties in recent days, was delivered from Yan'an to Zhou Enlai in Shanghai last night, and Wang Bingnan visited Ambassador Stuart at 11:00 AM on the 8th to verbally inform him of their opinions. After Wang left, the Ambassador immediately visited Special Envoy Marshall to discuss the matter and inform him of everything. His personal advisor, Fu Jingbo, also visited Premier Song around 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, the Ambassador again invited Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan to meet and review the morning's discussions. After reading the evening newspapers from 5:00 PM, people in Nanjing, having learned of the Communist Party's attitude towards the government, spread the fear that a rupture was imminent. Subsequently, the American Embassy issued another public statement from Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, and the political atmosphere shifted from yesterday's hopes to a pervasive mood of pessimism. The reporter then visited government officials Shao Lizi and Zhang Lisheng, who both stated that they still hoped Zhou Enlai would return to Nanjing to reopen negotiations and unanimously believed that the fairness and sincerity of the two mediators, Marshall and Stuart, were deeply commendable. Liang Shuming of the Democratic League stated that he had no prior knowledge and expressed astonishment at the Communist Party's response. He said that he would visit Dong Biwu this evening to inquire about the matter. A spokesperson for the Communist Party delegation offered the following explanation to the reporter: 1. They had no prior knowledge of the American statement before it was published. Dong Biwu had not learned of it when he went to the Embassy in the afternoon, and only found out after it was published. 2. One aspect of the statement did not conform to the original suggestion, namely that the government specifically stated that the Communist Party should "implement" the two points mentioned in the government's memorandum of October 2nd within the ten-day ceasefire period, while the statement said "consider." Also, regarding the issue of troops returning to their original defenses, it referred to the withdrawal of the troops attacking Zhangjiakou, not the withdrawal of all troops. The reporter inquired about his opinion on this public statement, and the spokesperson said that Zhou Enlai would issue a formal statement, which was currently being drafted, and once drafted, it would express the Communist Party's attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Chinese Communists Repeatedly Break Faith; Marshall and Stuart Raise Questions <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart summoned the Communist Party representative Dong Biwu to a meeting at the American Embassy at 4:00 PM this afternoon to determine the Communist Party's views on the new compromise proposal. This move by the two envoys seemed to be a last-minute effort to salvage the deteriorating peace talks. Mr. Dong reiterated the Communist Party's attitude to the two envoys, stating that the Communist Party regarded an unconditional and comprehensive ceasefire as a prerequisite for resuming peace talks. Marshall asked why the Communist Party was refusing to participate, given that it had once said that if the government stopped attacking Zhangjiakou, the Communist Party would participate in the five-person conference. Mr. Dong replied that the Communist Party had never made such an announcement because the government and the American mediators had not guaranteed that the government would cease military operations if the conference proceeded. The two envoys then said that since the government had agreed to stop attacking Zhangjiakou, they did not understand why the Communist Party was making new demands on the government. Mr. Dong replied that if the government troops were still within fifteen miles of Zhangjiakou, the Communist Party could not consider the city's danger to have been removed. Mr. Dong also made a counter-proposal, advocating that the National Army withdraw to its original positions before September 1st. At the same time, the Communist Party delegation here is carefully studying the Marshall-Stuart statement. A Communist Party spokesperson said that the statement quoted Zhou Enlai's reply with many inaccuracies, such as the last sentence, which said that Zhou "...believes that it is unnecessary to return to Nanjing," which was surprising because Wang Bingnan had removed this sentence when conveying the reply.</p>

<p>Evading Negotiations and Commanding the Chinese Communists</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] At this time when peace hangs by a thread, all parties are paying close attention to the actions of the Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai. Some non-partisan figures hope that Mr. Zhou will return to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 20th to break the deadlock. According to an observer here, Mr. Zhou Enlai's trip to Shanghai seems to be an action based on a pre-determined plan, aimed at evading negotiations, because Mr. Zhou is well aware that after Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing from Jiangxi, the government will invite Mr. Zhou to resume negotiations. It was also learned from well-informed sources that the Communist Party claimed that Mr. Zhou's mission to Shanghai was to negotiate the investigation into the ban on the "Masses Weekly," but this was merely a smokescreen. His real mission was to urge the key leaders of the Democratic League to restore unity, under the instigation and exploitation of the Chinese Communists, in order to cope with the upcoming National Assembly. Since February, Zhang Lan, ill in Chengdu, and Luo Longji have had a dispute over neutrality and non-neutrality. Huang Yanpei has shown no expression other than focusing on his educational career. Shen Junru is also quite silent and lacks activity. Liang Shuming intends to resign as Secretary-General of the Democratic League. Mr. Zhou Enlai is extremely concerned about this situation. The meeting of the key leaders of the Democratic League in Shanghai happened to coincide with Mr. Zhou Enlai's arrival in Shanghai, and the relationship between them cannot be said to be accidental. Moreover, after arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Zhou told a reporter from the United Press that he had withdrawn from the negotiations and would not return to Nanjing unless Chairman Chiang agreed to convene a military three-person group meeting. However, when the three-person group and five-person group were about to be held at the same time, the Chinese Communists raised conditions to obstruct them. This further proves that his trip to Shanghai was not only to promote the unity of the Democratic League but also had other intentions. Therefore, it is certain that Mr. Zhou's trip to Shanghai is related to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Discussing the deployment of new special agents sent to Shanghai with key personnel such as the liaison minister of the Central Military Region.</p>
<p>(2) Urging the overt personnel in Nanjing and Shanghai to end their external activities, concentrate in Shanghai to prepare for evacuation, and have specialized personnel draft an evacuation plan.</p>
<p>(3) Inciting pro-Communist elements to form a so-called "Committee to Substantially Aid the Chinese Communists" to raise huge sums of money at home and abroad so that the Chinese Communists can obtain substantial material assistance.</p>
<p>(4) Negotiating transportation and communication links with certain parties so that the materials obtained and aided in Shanghai can be smoothly transported to the Communist areas.</p>
<p>(5) Inciting an anti-American movement to stir up an anti-American trend in China and the United States. It is reported that he has ordered specialized personnel to collect materials from all sides to compile and issue a so-called "Record of American Military Atrocities." In addition, he wants to infiltrate the Chinese Communist organization into the press, strengthen cultural propaganda offensives, strengthen worker organizations, and absorb technical personnel to go to the "Liberated Areas." From this, it can be seen that Mr. Zhou's trip to Shanghai is entrusted with a secret and major mission.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Premier Sun's Remarks <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago. A reporter called on his private residence yesterday and asked for his opinion on the recent launch of the so-called "Week of Responding to the Withdrawal of American Troops from China" by a small number of people in Shanghai. Mr. Sun said: "The withdrawal of American troops is by no means a serious issue. First, the American military has no intention of permanently stationing troops in China. Second, the American military's stationing in China was approved by the government and has a specific mission. Once the mission is completed, they should naturally withdraw. Third, the American military's stationing in China has not interfered in China's internal affairs, and it is groundless to say that it affects China's sovereignty and independence." The reporter then asked whether the recent proposals in some newspapers to keep Soviet troops stationed in Lushun and Dalian was of the same nature as the stationing of American troops in China. He said that according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, Dalian cannot station troops, and Lushun is a seaport shared by the two countries. Therefore, the stationing of Soviet troops in Lushun and Dalian cannot be confused with the stationing of American troops in China. Finally, the reporter inquired about Mr. Sun's views on the current domestic situation. He said that the current financial and economic situation is caused by errors in the policies of the administrative authorities.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] Xinhua News Agency broadcasted from Zhangjiakou on the 6th, falsely claiming that Communist troops had invaded Fragrant Hills and Hot Springs in the western suburbs. According to the spokesperson of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters: Although Communist troops attempted to invade the western suburbs around Shahe, Changping on September 29th, only minor clashes occurred because the National Army was prepared. The Communist troops did not succeed. The Communist propaganda about occupying Fragrant Hills and Hot Springs is a ridiculous lie. The area near these two places is safe and sound, with no trace of Communist troops.</p>

As of yesterday, the two armies were engaged in fierce battles in villages about ten li east of Huailai. The Communist troops seemed to be very stubborn, equipped with tanks and heavy artillery. The seesaw battle was extremely fierce, and the Communist troops continued to reinforce Huailai. The train service between Beiping and Nankou, which was once suspended due to Communist sabotage, has been restored, and military transport is busy. Qiao Tingshan, chairman of the Chahar Provincial Party Headquarters, went to Nankou by car on the afternoon of the 8th to supervise and improve party affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Arch-Traitor Who Ruined the Country Did Not Repent Until Death: Lin Baosheng Executed Yesterday by Firing Squad, Claiming "Sacrificing Life for Righteousness" Before Execution <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Lin Baosheng, this Oriental Goebbels, was executed by firing squad today. He continued to spew venomous words until his death. At 1:20 PM on the 8th, a line of people waiting to visit prisoners was lined up at the right side of the gate of the Tiger Bridge Capital Prison, but everyone's eyes were unanimously focused on a middle-aged woman hiding under a small pine tree on the left side, trying to avoid the cameras of reporters, and two children. The woman wore a bun, a gray woolen cheongsam, a light cyan Mao coat, and yellowish-gray leather shoes, dressed very neatly; the girl was fourteen or fifteen years old, wearing a dark blue cloth cheongsam, light gray socks, black "Hercules" shoes, her face flushed; the boy was seven or eight years old, wearing a light cyan shirt, blue cloth overalls, yellow leather shoes, squatting on the ground, playing with a small rattan bag filled with sundries, rubbing his eyes from time to time, while the woman and the girl stroked him from time to time.</p>
<p>A bailiff took an official document and gave it to the woman. She read it, accepted it, her eyes red, and wrote a receipt: "Received a sentencing document, Lin Xu-ying, October 8th." She was Lin Baosheng's wife, and the two children were her daughter and nephew. At 2:15 PM, two more women arrived in rickshaws, hurriedly calling them away as they wept, attempting a last-ditch effort. But a quarter of an hour later, Chen Luo, an official from the Capital High Court, arrived, followed by a large group of reporters. It turned out that the afternoon of the 8th was the execution date for Lin Baosheng.</p>
<p>At 2:40 PM, before the simple case of interrogating the traitor Mei Si-ping, Lin Baosheng stood there. Supported by the bailiffs, he reluctantly left the prison. Under the scrutiny of reporters' cameras and gazes, he walked into the temporary courtroom, wearing a light gray Parisian Cantonese-style short-crotch suit, gray socks, black shoes, newly groomed hair, and wearing a pair of chrome-rimmed glasses, looking calm. His short, stout body stood calmly in front of the execution supervisor Chen, a faint smile on his pale face.</p>
<p>Stubborn to the End</p>
<p>"What's your name?" the execution supervisor asked.</p>
<p>"Lin Baosheng!" the traitor Lin replied.</p>
<p>"How old are you?"</p>
<p>"Forty-five years old."</p>
<p>"Where are you from?"</p>
<p>"Panyu, Guangdong."</p>
<p>"Where do you live?"</p>
<p>"13 Shanghai Road, Nanjing."</p>
<p>"Were you arrested for being a traitor?" (The traitor Lin nodded).</p>
<p>"Was your case tried by the Capital High Court?" (Nodded).</p>
<p>Now we are acting on the instructions of the Procuratorate of the Supreme Court, transferred by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, your death sentence is to be executed immediately, do you have any last words?</p>
<p>"Yes." The traitor Lin shook a black leather book, a booklet, and a kraft paper package he was holding in his hand.</p>
<p>"Good, you need to calm down at this moment!"</p>
<p>The traitor Lin chuckled wickedly, "It's nothing, it's nothing, this is a matter for the country, don't worry, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, I still have a few words to write!"</p>
<p>Laughable Distorted Poem</p>
<p>On a separate desk, he wrote a poem in running script on the last page of the book "For Xu Ying and my children to remember: Spring goes and spring comes at a fixed time, flowers bloom and fall without certainty, life's metabolism is also like this, what is there to refuse in sacrificing life for righteousness? Baosheng, October 8th, 2:55 PM." On the back cover, he also wrote two slogans: "Revolution to save the country, science to build the country!" It was an elementary English calculus textbook. At this time, the execution supervisor said: "It's 2:55!" After he finished writing, he submitted it along with the package of last words, a booklet written for someone else, and then took a step back, waiting for the execution supervisor to ask if there was anything else to say. He then straightened his clothes, puffed out his chest, and began his final speech:</p>
<p>Two Requests</p>
<p>"I feel regret that when I was asked to come out just now, they only said it was to meet with family members, and did not say it was for execution, which means that I was not prepared at all, this is not in accordance with legal procedures, although not telling the person involved may be because they are afraid of being timid, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, the country's affairs should be made public, I don't have any inheritance, but I am very relieved, because my family can survive by begging. I have two requests: First, do not tie me up like in the era of autocracy; second, do not cut my clothes like when inspecting Mei Si-ping!"</p>
<p>Two Bullets End His Life</p>
<p>The execution supervisor agreed to all of his requests, then picked up the pen and wrote heavily: "Death sentence executed!" A checkmark was made above and below the name, and the bailiffs escorted him out. He strode forward on Mei Si-ping's path. At 3:02 PM, with a loud bang, a bullet entered the back of his head and came out from the top of his skull. After he fell down, he turned over and lay on his back, blood shooting out from the bullet hole, but he was not completely dead, still groaning and breathing. Moving, blood also spurted from his mouth from time to time. After a minute and a half, another shot was fired, and he finally died at 3:08 PM, with a hideous and blurred face, and a red mouth that could not be closed. This oriental Goebbels continued to spew venomous words until his death.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] After the traitor Lin Baosheng was executed, his family was notified, and his two children and a nephew went to the Capital Prison to collect the body. It is said that the body was moved to a certain temple for encoffining.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Wang Yintai, the chairman of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, was sentenced to death by the Capital High Court at 11:10 this morning.

After hearing the judgment, the traitor Wang remained silent and lowered his head, his face devoid of expression. The court then declared: "Your position is too high, and your official rank is too great, so we must impose the maximum penalty. If you do not agree, you can apply for a retrial within ten days." The traitor Wang nodded woodenly.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Talking About the Limitless Bright Future of Xinjiang: Significant Progress in Politics and Economy, Universal Suffrage in the Whole Province Actively Underway <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Ma Yanzhang, manager of the Dihua branch of the Central Bank, who has lived in Xinjiang for three years and came to Shanghai via Hami and Chongqing this time, and plans to attend the third business meeting of the Central Bank held in Nanjing on the 11th, recently told reporters that Xinjiang has made significant progress in politics, economy, and finance. It is expected that within a few years, it will be transformed and enter the stage of modernization, comparable to other provinces. In terms of finance, the legal currency is in circulation, the currency system is stable, and the Central Bank has branches in Dihua and Hami, supplemented by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. Three years before the victory, the government resolved to unify the currency system of Xinjiang Province. According to the local price index at that time, it was stipulated that ten yuan of legal currency would be converted into one yuan of new currency. Moreover, the Central Bank actively promoted industrial and commercial remittances to facilitate the exchange of goods and smooth financial operations. In the first half of this year, remittances out reached more than 16 billion yuan, and remittances in reached 31.4 billion yuan. In terms of trade, the target is the Soviet Union. In the past, there was no control, and the barter system was very popular for a while. Exports mainly include wool, sheepskin, sheep intestines, silk, and raisins, exchanged for manufactured goods and luxury goods. Due to the environment, the people are deeply influenced by the Soviet Union, and Russian is popular. Before Soviet commerce is brought into order, smuggling is inevitable. The peak season for trade in the province is summer and autumn. In late autumn, it falls into snow and ice, and merchants cannot make a living. When merchants sell goods, they transport coarse cloth from inland areas to Dihua in northern Xinjiang in exchange for gold to make ends meet. Gold is produced in Xinjiang, and locals regard it as a treasure. Its price is calculated by the price of rice, and it is currently valued at 280,000 yuan per tael of legal currency. The actual weights and measures are still conservatively calculated at 125%. When unrest occurs locally, people often carry gold to flee, so gold prices are affected every time the situation fluctuates. Mr. Ma believes that the future of Xinjiang Province is bright because it is rich in products and has amazing reserves. The island of Su oil mine between Yili and Dihua is of unparalleled quality. If refined, it can become aviation fuel. Although it has been damaged by a certain party, it is not difficult to find ways to rectify it, and our government has paid attention to this. In addition to Dihua being the political and military center, Yili is also rich in grain, with sufficient rice and flour, and is the granary of the entire province. Coal and iron are readily available, especially the Ashan Tacheng gold mine, which is famous. Other places have their own specialties, and fruits are even more common. Except for the Tianshan Mountains as the dividing line between the north and south of Xinjiang, the province has few large mountains and rivers, and it is not difficult to reorganize transportation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 5th] (Delayed arrival) The universal suffrage of county magistrates, county councilors, and provincial councilors in Xinjiang is actively underway. The ten election supervision teams organized by the provincial government have all departed one after another yesterday and today. The provincial government believes that the election is a major event, and specially published a statement to the people, signed by Governor Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Governor Raheb Mati, and Bao Erhan, repeatedly emphasizing the meaning of "election according to law" and strictly prohibiting "fraudulent manipulation." The personnel of the election supervision team and all the previously announced changes have been made, and all district commissioners will not participate in the election supervision work. This was decided by the provincial government at its recent provincial affairs meeting. This time, the election of county magistrates in Xinjiang adopts the "nomination election" method, not a vote-based election, so the responsibility of the election supervision team is extremely important.</p>

<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 8th] The fighting in the Jiaoxian area, north of Ji-bi, in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway has been fierce for several days. The battles on the line of Dujiamiaozi, Xiaozhaojia, Wulihouzi, Weng-qiu north of Jiaoxian and the line of Mashan and Lianhua Mountain north of Jimo were fierce on the 7th. The areas south of Yinmazhuang on the east bank of the Wei River in the middle section and the Zuoshan area are also in fierce fighting. After the National troops recovered Zuoshan yesterday on the 5th, they were recaptured by the Communist troops on the 6th. The National troops fought bravely and recaptured Zuoshan again. The Communist troops are actively increasing their troops in various battlefields. Most of the artillery fire used is transported from the Northeast. The battle is expected to enter a more intense stage. The Communist troops north and south of the railway line in the western section are still busy mobilizing and replenishing, and there are also attempts to launch another battle. The Communist troops near Zichuan and Boshan are actively increasing, and the war is imminent. After the Communist troops near Jining breached the dikes, the disaster area is vast. Wuliying east of the city of Jining and the area east of the railway and the canal are all flooded, with a water depth of more than one meter. South of the city, west of the canal, and south of Lijiaji to Wang-guitun, the autumn fields east and south of Daliudian were all submerged. Hundreds of hectares of farmland around Matihu Lake west of the city were submerged. The water around Songjialukou, Lijiamiao, and Fenghuangtai was one meter deep. Fortunately, the water level has dropped. Jiangjialou and Daizhuang north of the city have become swamps.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Don't Let Down the Expectations of the People <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The overall situation of the country is extremely serious! The hope for peace had a glimmer of light, but it was covered by the shadow of the CCP's reply!</p>
<p>We read the public statement issued again yesterday by Ambassadors Marshall and Stuart, and the speech given by President Song after arriving in Nanjing yesterday, and we feel both joy and fear. The joy is that President Song said that the government has not given up the path of peaceful negotiation; the fear is that Mr. Zhou Enlai's reply has covered the dawn of peace, which could have been achieved by stopping the war in Zhangjiakou, with clouds.</p>
<p>The government has repeatedly called for a ceasefire and military reorganization, but the CCP insisted on discussing politics first, so there was the suggestion of the "Five-Person Group" by Ambassadors Marshall and Stuart to discuss political issues. After the government accepted it, the "Five-Person Group" should have been able to start immediately, but the CCP turned around and insisted on discussing a military ceasefire first. This is the first change. Later, the Five-Person Group (political) and the Three-Person Conference (military) could not agree, so the government, in order to take the overall situation into consideration, allowed the "Three" and "Five" to be held at the same time, pursuing both political and military solutions, so that a quick solution could be found for peace in China, which should not have been a problem. However, the CCP suddenly issued a memorandum on September 30, demanding that the government immediately stop attacking Zhangjiakou, otherwise it would consider the peace talks to have broken down, so the door to peace was almost blocked. This is the second change. At that time, everyone was worried, thinking that the government would hardly agree, and that the CCP was deliberately raising a difficult question, intending to break down the talks. This newspaper, in its editorial on the 4th, strongly advocated that "the overall situation of the country cannot be further delayed" and called on both sides to endure for the sake of the country. In particular, we expected the government to "be kind to others" and not to close the door to peace under any circumstances. Therefore, we believed that even if the war in Zhangjiakou was temporarily suspended for a few days, to wait for the discussion and resolution of all issues, it would not be impossible. Now, Ambassadors Marshall and Stuart stated that, upon the suggestion of the two ambassadors, President Chiang has agreed to order a halt to the advance on Zhangjiakou for sixteen days, during which time the Five-Person Group and the Three-Person Conference will be convened to discuss the two concessions proposed by the government in its October 2 statement. Logically speaking, since the CCP previously requested that the war in Zhangjiakou be stopped first before discussing other matters, now that the government has agreed to a ten-day ceasefire in Zhangjiakou, the CCP should immediately send representatives to attend the two meetings, and Mr. Zhou Enlai should especially come to Nanjing as soon as possible to be responsible for the negotiations. However, the CCP has changed its mind again, insisting that this ceasefire is only the government's strategy, and that discussing it during the ceasefire is under military pressure, so Mr. Zhou has no need to return to Nanjing. To be honest, although the government has agreed to a ten-day ceasefire in Zhangjiakou to resume peace talks, the CCP has rejected it again. This is the third change; and this third change is even more unexpected!</p>
<p>From this series of facts, the government is retreating step by step, hoping for peace all the time, while the CCP is pressing forward step by step, changing its mind all the time, and its attempt to break down the peace talks has been completely exposed. The CCP's approach is, in its own view, well-calculated, and it believes that once it announces a breakdown, it can establish its own government and find its own backers. But it does not know that it is violating public opinion and losing people's hearts, and everything will be impossible to discuss.</p>
<p>For the sake of the country, for the sake of the nation, and even for the sake of the CCP's own future, we sincerely advise the CCP not to let down the expectations of the people!</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Regarding the rationing of cheap cloth to public school teachers and civil servants, the investigation work has been completed.

<h3 id="e33">Portuguese Spy Luo Mingzhi Indicted by the Sichuan Procuratorate for Sneaking into the Interior to Gather Military Intelligence During Wartime <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing, 7th] The case of Luo Mingzhi (original name Laurence Oswal Dcenna), a Portuguese spy suspect who was previously transferred from Kunming to Chongqing by the Military Intelligence Bureau, has been concluded by the Sichuan High Court First Branch Procuratorate. He is deemed to have violated Article 1, Paragraph 1, Items 1, 4, and 5 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China. A public prosecution is initiated according to Article 230 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Luo Mingzhi is currently forty-four years old, his father is Portuguese, and his mother is Chinese. He grew up in Shanghai. In October 1937, he went to Macau and served as a police officer in the Portuguese government, eventually being promoted to detective. He had close ties with Chen Rengui, a special agent stationed in Macau by the Japanese. At that time, he assisted in disrupting the organization and facilities of Chinese government personnel stationed in Macau in order to obtain rewards. In November 1943, he was ordered by Chen Rengui to sneak into the interior, tasked with gathering military intelligence on our side. He initially served at the Hongmei Restaurant in Guilin (frequented by many Allied military personnel stationed in China), specializing in receiving foreign guests. The following year, in October, when Guilin was evacuated, he transferred to Kunming and took a managerial position at the American Red Cross Victory Club as a cover to achieve his mission. Last winter, he was detected by the Anti-Espionage Intelligence Office of the Aviation Commission Investigation Team in Kunming and the American Counterintelligence Reporting Office stationed in Kunming. He was arrested and sent to the Military Intelligence Bureau, which transferred him to the Sichuan High Court First Branch Procuratorate. After extensive interrogation, Luo Mingzhi absolutely denied the facts of his crime, but ultimately failed to justify his actions. Furthermore, the Procuratorate has obtained a substantial amount of relevant evidence, all of which proves that he was indeed a spy sent by the Japanese to the Chinese interior. Therefore, a public prosecution has been initiated according to the law.</p>

<p>[Our Huaiyin Dispatch, 5th] Most of the supplies in the newly recovered areas of northern Jiangsu have been carried away by the Communist troops, leaving little for the civilian population. It is reported that in order to alleviate the hardships of the people, the government has not only already exempted the land tax for the 34th year of the Republic, but will also exempt the land tax for this year. The order is expected to be announced soon.</p>
<p>[Our Huaiyin Dispatch, 5th] Today, I traveled along the Lianghuai Highway to inspect Huai'an. I am the first reporter to arrive here after the area was recovered. The highway is intact, but only military jeeps can pass. There are no commercial vehicles. Huai'an has three cities: the old and new outer cities. It was formerly the headquarters of the Central China Military Region of the Communist troops. The market is now depressed, and the number of returning people is limited. The scene is desolate. I searched the entire city and found no restaurants or hotels, only a few bathhouses open for business. The price of local products is very low. The residents who remained in the city do not know the value of the legal currency; everything is calculated in copper coins. Copper coins are worth 1,500 yuan in legal currency. Imported foreign goods, such as Marlboro cigarettes, cost 2,500 yuan per pack. I visited the "Crotch Crossing Bridge" of Han Xin. Only a stele remains; the bridge is no longer there. The current residents are looking forward to the dredging of the canal, hoping to revitalize the region.</p>

<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The Wuxi Headquarters of the Capital Garrison Command previously requisitioned twelve civilian ships, large and small, from the three counties of Su, Xi, and Yi, to concentrate in Wuqiao, for the purpose of clearing out scattered bandits in Taihu Lake. Now, the main force of Liao Bingnan's bandits in Taihu Lake has been pacified, and the sporadic small bandits are also being cleared out in order. However, the traitor Xue Yonghui's troops are still roaming in the area, disturbing the locality. The headquarters has decided to further exterminate them completely. Director Chen Jian has also contacted relevant authorities in Shanghai to use landing craft to clear the lake. Furthermore, Liao Bingnan's troops have been stationed in Xukou, Suzhou, responsible for defense. Liao Bingnan himself came to Xi on the 5th and visited Chief of Staff Mao that evening, expressing his loyalty to the Party and the country and his maintenance of the locality. He also reported on the situation of his troops after being incorporated. Chief of Staff Mao encouraged and praised him for his conversion. Liao Bingnan and others went to Chang that night to report to Commander Li of the First Pacification Zone.</p>
<p>[Our Qingpu Dispatch] The bandit Li Defu's troops, impersonating names, run rampant in the countryside, wandering between the second and third districts of this county, committing rape, arson, and robbery, doing whatever they please. Recently, they robbed a small steamboat traveling between Qingpu and Luxu, shooting and wounding two people; they looted Xiaozheng Town in the third district, abducting many men and women, and daring to extort money by name, showing no regard for the law. The county magistrates of Qing and Kunshan have urgently telegraphed the Pacification Zone to allocate troops to the county to join forces with the local troops to encircle and suppress them. County Magistrate Liu Jin has been touring various places, giving instructions to ensure a complete annihilation.</p>

<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The Wuxian District Court Procuratorate, acting on orders from superiors, is investigating the enemy and puppet toxic crimes during the occupation of Suzhou. The preliminary work has been completed. The case is being handled by Prosecutor Luo Shibin. According to the investigation files, summonses were issued on the 5th to summon opium tycoons Wang Guishan, Zhu Zhenhua of Hongji Shantang, and Zhang Yiyun, Hou Songling, Ma Zhaocheng, Li Shoubai, Xiao Yang, Zheng Shibin, Huang Zhuyan and other heads of opium shops. However, none of the defendants appeared, indicating that they were evading punishment. Therefore, interrogation could not be carried out. According to Prosecutor Luo, if they fail to appear again after being summoned, arrest warrants will be issued or requests for wanted notices will be filed in order to bring them to justice. It is reported that there are still some major opium dealers who have not been reported, and it is planned to conduct a new investigation and report them one by one, and summon them for interrogation together. Furthermore, Ding Guangshi, who served as a standing director of the Suzhou Special Industry Association during the enemy and puppet period, fled in fear of punishment after the victory.

<h3 id="e47">Unexpected Harvest Amidst Conclusion; Investigation Team Receives Threatening Letter; Signed "Colleagues Receiving in Wuhan"; Letter Contains Drawings of Two Hand Grenades <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 8th] In the midst of concluding its work, the Hunan-Jiangxi District Investigation Team suddenly received a threatening letter signed "Colleagues Receiving in Wuhan". The letter contained drawings of two hand grenades, with the words "Emergency Warning" written above. The body of the letter read: "The investigation work should stop at an appropriate point. Patting flies and touching tigers, it is easy to get rich through receiving. Seeking fame and fishing for reputation through supervision and reporting, getting by is enough, why bother? What does it matter to you what others have obtained through fortune? You can stop if you have profited from gold digging. If you don't get out, beware of bombs." The letter was signed "Mr. Qiu Ao, for your consideration." After receiving the letter, Qiu told reporters with a smile: "This letter can be used as a report from our team to the central government." He added that the sender would gain nothing else from it. Qiu was originally scheduled to fly to Nanjing today, but since the concluding meeting of the joint office of the team in Nanjing is still pending, he has decided to return to Hunan first.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 7th] The spokesperson for the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi District Investigation Team recently made the following observations to reporters regarding the investigation: (A) The local situation is not simple, and the receiving authorities are unable to control it, leading to chaos, and some people are inevitably robbing from it. (B) The lists are disorganized, and many agencies have changed heads several times, making it impossible to conduct a complete and systematic investigation, which is a great pity. (C) In Hubei Province, the investigation mainly covered Wuhan, and the other forty-one counties and cities, such as Yichang and Huanggang, were not thoroughly investigated, which is another shortcoming. (D) It is hoped that the court will appreciate the great significance of this central investigation and bring the cases transferred to the court for trial to a swift conclusion, without injustice. (E) This team is coming to an end, but this work can still be reported to the Supervisory Commissioner's Office or the judicial authorities. It is hoped that everyone will continue to work hard with justice and determination in order to completely eradicate corruption and establish a clean and honest atmosphere.</p>

<p>[Hankou Dispatch] Japanese war criminal Ishigami Tetsushi, alias Shi Zhengtang, has been involved in Japanese aggression since 1934. In Liaoning, Nanjing, and other places, he engaged in secret activities under the guise of doing business. In 1940, he served as a translator for the Independent 18th Brigade of the Japanese 106th Division, and later as a liaison officer for the 97th Brigade of the 34th Division, carrying out espionage work in various counties in Hubei. He also organized the Xingya Association in Yichang, held the Dandao Association in Dangyang, and served as a part-time director of the Xiling Palace and a leader of the Zhian Palace, colluding with local officials, gangsters, and traitors to betray China and serve the Japanese army. He also continuously sold opium through his organized Xingya Association, implementing a toxic policy. After the Japanese army surrendered, he was captured by the intelligence team of the 66th Army Headquarters of the National Army and handed over to the military prosecutor of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters Military Court for investigation and prosecution. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. Another Taiwanese war criminal, Ke Dashu, was dispatched to Hankou in June 1940 by the Japanese Consul Hana Wheel to serve as a secretary in the puppet Hankou Municipal Police Bureau. He later served concurrently as the chief of the Economic Police Department of the Jia Hankou Police Bureau, and successively served as the leader of the Investigation Team of the Puppet Hubei Provincial Material and Price Investigation Committee, and the head of the Joint Office of the Economic Police Bureaus of the Puppet Wuyang and Hankou Police Bureaus. Relying on the power of the Japanese, he arbitrarily imposed fines on merchants and profited from them. Any violation of his will resulted in detention or other harm. After the Japanese army surrendered, he was sent to the Hubei Provincial High Court by the joint supervision office of the military, police, and gendarmerie, and then transferred to the military prosecutor of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters Military Court for investigation and prosecution. He was sentenced to imprisonment for seven and a half years and deprivation of public rights for seven years.</p>

He carried three net bags containing daily necessities and some old clothes. He was assigned room 112. He often went out and appeared calm, so the room attendant did not suspect anything. The next morning (the morning of the 5th), the room attendant, on change of shift, asked him to pay the room fee, but Xu Zhixiang politely asked if he could pay it together tomorrow and changed to room 118 to continue his stay. On the 5th, he still went out for a long time. He returned to his room late in the evening, closed the door, and went to sleep peacefully. He was not seen moving on the 6th. Until 4:00 PM, the on-duty room attendant Zhou Chunfa opened the door and peeped in, discovering that Xu Zhixiang's face was pale. He quickly informed Li Jinsheng, the manager of the hotel. He entered the room and found an empty bottle of Lysol disinfectant under the bed, confirming that he had taken poison. He was rushed to the Jingde Road Health Hospital for gastric lavage and emergency treatment. He slowly woke up two hours later and was sent back to the nearby Third Police Station. The police station had already sent Police Chief Wang Yixin to investigate. Three suicide notes, an empty Lysol bottle, six pawn tickets, and some other old clothes were seized. He had no money on him. The three suicide notes are as follows: (1) To escape the feudal family, I embarked on the path of suicide to obtain freedom in the afterlife and fulfill the wishes in my heart. Signed, Zhixiang. (2) Brother Li Ping, please give one of the net bags in my room to Gu Bin, and please convey my regards to Gu Bin on my behalf. (The bag contains Gu Bin's belongings, so give it to him.) Yours, Zhixiang. (3) This net bag belongs to Gu Bin, a soldier of the Second Platoon, First Squad, Second Company, First Battalion of the Security First Brigade. Please present it to him. Zhixiang. The brigade is currently residing in the Tianxing Garden Auditorium in front of the Zhenfu Temple. Zhixiang leaves a note.

He repeatedly asked Xu Zhixiang the reason for his suicide, but he kept his mouth shut and could not be speculated. The police station prepared a document and transferred the case to the Third Police Station. His family from Shanghai came to Suzhou to claim him.</p>

<p>Stopping Extortion by Boatmen is Urgently Needed</p>
<p>At the back gate of the Lv family in Ningbo, there are many boatmen rowing boats, navigating the main lines of various locations of Shannan, directly reaching Hetou City. Due to the numerous boats, a group of drifters formed a gang with significant latent power. Although nominally helping customers carry luggage and belongings, they are actually forcibly extorting money. Because passengers pass through this place, regardless of whether you are willing or not, they uniformly demand fees of two to three thousand yuan or more, calling it "upper river money" and "lower river money." These people are essentially highway robbers. It was like this during the enemy and puppet era, and since the victory, they are still menacing. If you don't give them money, they not only won't let you pass but will also beat you up. Passengers suffer their abuse but still have to pay them. I have witnessed this and experienced it myself. I earnestly request the Ningbo police authorities to implement strict crackdowns to ensure the safety of travelers. (Shaofei)</p>
<p>Sock Factories Request Universal Allocation of Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>According to regulations, knitting factories can purchase cotton yarn from the China Textile Corporation (Zhongfang). We recently followed the procedures to register with the guild first, so that it could be forwarded to Zhongfang for processing. Now, according to the guild, Zhongfang has stopped processing registration matters, and new applicants cannot be approved. It is also said that those who have already been approved must re-register and go through the procedures again, but the date for re-registration is far off. Therefore, some sock factories can receive allocated yarn, while those who have not yet registered cannot enjoy this right. We hope that the yarn allocation authorities can establish regulations as soon as possible so that we sock factories that have been left out can complete the procedures and everyone can receive allocated yarn. This is the common request of our sock factories. (Hu Yi)</p>

<h3 id="e62">The Peace Conference Continues to Discuss the Treaty with Italy: Representatives from Various Countries Debate Fiercely, The Trieste Question is the Most Difficult, Bevin Warns Southern Countries Not to Make More Mistakes <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 8th Radio: The Paris Peace Conference continued its plenary session today. British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech, stating that he absolutely opposed the draft treaty with Italy because the obligations stipulated in the draft were beyond the ability of the new Italy to bear. Bevin also warned Yugoslavia not to repeat the same mistakes as with the Trieste issue.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris threw a "bomb" at the Peace Conference's plenary session today, urging the representatives to reject Articles 21 and 22 of the treaty with Italy, which stipulate that Italy recognize and respect Albania's sovereignty and cede the island of Saseno to Albania. The Greek Prime Minister pointed out that the island should belong to Greece.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 8th] The plenary session of the Peace Conference began at 9:30 AM today with Molotov as chairman. A total of nine speakers, including the four major powers, are scheduled to speak today and express their opinions on the most thorny issue of Trieste. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak spoke first, saying that the general pessimism about the Peace Conference seemed excessive. Spaak pointed out that rebuilding the world was not easy when the concept of retaliation was still in people's hearts. Because the victorious countries suffered heavy losses, even the slightest problem seemed difficult. Spaak then criticized the procedural rules of this conference, saying that their results were enough to prevent the motions and cooperation of small countries. He hoped that a more reasonable procedural law could be adopted when negotiating the peace treaty with Germany. Polish representative Zimosky then spoke, saying that the treaty with Italy should first give Yugoslavia fair treatment. Yugoslavia suffered the most damage during the war, and the Gorizia region of Italy should be ceded to Yugoslavia. The free zone of the port of Trieste should be limited to the urban area. Greek representative Tsaldaris believed that Italy's compensation of 100 million US dollars to Greece was too small. Italy's current economic situation is very good, while Greece is still devastated and should receive more compensation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Paris, 8th Radio, New York News: US Treasury Secretary Humes departed for Paris today.</p>
<p>The Key to the Success or Failure of the Peace Conference</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 7th] After South African Prime Minister Smuts claimed in the plenary session of the Peace Conference that the Paris Peace Conference had not failed, some representatives felt that his words were indeed those of an old politician, but others believed that it was too early to tell. However, in any case, the basis for optimism depends on the following two things: (1) Whether the Soviet delegation will again express opposition when the Peace Conference's plenary session votes on the Italian Political Committee's recommendations on Trieste the day after tomorrow. Whether the Soviet Union promises to be bound by the Peace Conference's recommendations on Trieste when the foreign ministers of the four powers draft the final text of the Italian peace treaty after the Peace Conference. Before these two questions are answered, it is impossible to immediately determine the success or failure of the Peace Conference.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Guo Taiqi Reiterates Our Opinion: It Is Not Appropriate to Overburden Italy's Economy, Advocates that Libya Should Achieve Independence <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 7th] The Paris Peace Conference continued its plenary session at the Luxembourg Palace at 9:35 PM tonight. Ukrainian representative Manuisky first spoke, criticizing the resolution made by the Peace Conference on the four districts of Trieste. Dr. Guo Taiqi, Acting Head of the Chinese Delegation, then delivered a speech, saying that the efforts made by the Peace Conference have enabled people from all countries in the world to have a further understanding of maintaining lasting world peace, so it cannot be said to be futile. The committees have spent a very long time, working hard, and discussing various issues, which is worthy of praise. Speaking of China's attitude, I believe that the military terms of the treaty with Italy should be sufficient to prevent the recurrence of aggressive wars. In terms of economic terms, the compensation to be paid should not impose an excessive burden on the Italian economy. As for politics and territory, I am very pleased that several special clauses in the treaty related to China can be passed smoothly. I still remember that during the Boxer Rebellion, Italy demanded 27 million US dollars from China in compensation for the deaths of seven overseas Chinese, but at this time, China did not demand any compensation from Italy. Not only that, China was also the first among all countries to return all the property of Italian overseas Chinese in the country to the original owners. He also said that he fully agreed with the plan put forward by France on the Trieste issue. Regarding the disposal of Italy's old colonies, we firmly advocate that it should be discussed and that Libya should be independent immediately, otherwise it should at least be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations for several years.</p>

Van also explained the reason why Indonesia's public opinion representative institutions have not yet been established, saying that the situation in the East Indies is complicated, and the government has to take into account the relationship with the mother country, military affairs, the British government, Indonesian people with republican ideas, and the lack of sympathy from the outside world. However, he said that recently, steps have been taken to establish this public opinion representative institution. Regarding the British army, Van said: There are those in the British army who have been actively serving for more than six years, and the British will never fight against the Indonesian people.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Britain Builds New Strategic Base to Protect the Lifeline of the Middle East <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Status of Suez is Important and Will Never Be Abandoned</p>
<p>[United Press London, 7th] A senior Army Department official announced today that the British General Staff has proposed that the British administrative and supply bases in various parts of Palestine in the Middle East and in Kenya and Tanganyika in South Africa be abolished, and only forward military bases be maintained in Sudan, Palestine, Transjordan, and Iraq. The period is limited to what is practically feasible. This change is due to the gradual withdrawal of British troops from India, Egypt, and the unstable situation in Palestine. Although the precariousness and instability of the situation in Palestine has prompted the General Staff to make this proposal, the British army will never withdraw completely from the area. Military generals strongly support the possibility of developing the Negev Desert area in southern Palestine, and at least a combat base will be established there, equipped with limited supply stations. As times change, Britain is changing its century-old policy of protecting the lifeline of the intercontinental empire, which is inevitable. However, Defense Minister Alexander will never give up the Suez Canal politically or militarily, and will not give up Palestine and retreat to the Negev. The reason is here. At present, there are three divisions of British troops stationed in Palestine, which is almost the largest force of the British in the Middle East. Once the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty is revised, Egypt will inevitably lose its long-term military plans. Iraq has also become an unknown in the Chulai Plan. The Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 is valid for another nine years, but the Iraqi government formally proposed to revise the treaty at the beginning of this year, which will eventually lead to the complete withdrawal of British troops. In addition to Palestine, Malta, and Cyprus, Britain can only station a small number of troops indefinitely in Transjordan. Palestine and Transjordan are not suitable for accommodating large-scale naval, land, and air force bases.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Stuttgart, 7th] Former German Minister of Economy Schacht arrived here tonight from Nuremberg for only one hour before being arrested by German police under orders. He is now being held in the Stuttgart police prison and will be charged with his former relationship with the Nazis and tried by the anti-Nazi tribunal here. Schacht immediately protested and took out a letter from the US military government, proving that he was free to act in the US-occupied area, but the police ignored it. Schacht then requested permission to meet with his wife and his lawyer, and to appeal directly to the German official who issued the arrest warrant. The US military government also issued a statement on this matter, saying that if the German side prosecutes Schacht, it is within the scope of German law and has nothing to do with the US military government. The US military government is only concerned that the case must be conducted according to law.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] Paris, 8th Radio Nuremberg News: Nazi war criminal Frank, who was sentenced to death, said he did not want to see his wife again. The wives of Uter, Ribbentrop, etc. all eagerly hope to meet their husbands for the last time. The lawyers of the defendants have been unable to see their clients for three days, but they can only communicate with each other in writing, and each communication is carefully checked by experts. Jittel, Frank, Ribbentrop, and Streicher are all busy writing memoirs, but they are still immersed in writing long letters. Goering also sends out many family letters. Suker and Streicher never liked to write letters, but at this time they have to write a lot. The library in the Nuremberg prison is full of books of all kinds, ancient and modern. Suker, Rosenberg, and Spier are all immersed in classical literature and history, while Kaltenbrunner occasionally asks for modern works. The elderly Neurath prefers romance novels. Every day, the chaplains and priests of the occupying forces pray for them. The three meals are still good, with an average daily ration of 2,500 calories. Breakfast includes bread and coffee, lunch includes canned beef and potatoes, and occasionally you can eat a few more slices of white bread and sugar. Most of the war criminals have good appetites. Hess, during the long trial, used the excuse that the food was poisonous and refused to eat it lightly. Now he has reversed his usual state and also has a surprisingly good appetite. Everyone sleeps peacefully. The prison authorities strictly enforce the "silence" rule, so there is no midnight disturbance. Postal workers who deliver letters wear soft canvas hats instead of the white helmets of the military police, because the sound of the helmets touching the door may wake up the prisoners. The prisoners sentenced to death all have the freedom to write wills. The remaining seven prisoners who were sentenced to imprisonment will remain temporarily imprisoned in Nuremberg. Soldiers are still allowed to wear uniforms, but of course they are not allowed to wear medals and rank insignia. The prisoners in the prison receive an average of 50 letters a day, coming from all over Germany.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, Radio, 8th: The German war criminals who were sentenced to death are still in the lower level of the Nuremberg prison, while those who were sentenced to imprisonment are in the upper level.</p>

<p>[Remodeling Society Tokyo, 8th] The Far East International Tribunal entered the stage of examining Japanese-Soviet relations today. Many Soviet people were suddenly seen in the VIP seats and the United Nations reporters' seats. After the court opened, Soviet prosecutor Kolensky first read a long statement in Russian, detailing Japan's aggression against the Soviet Union over the decades, saying that Japan's aggression against the Soviet Union was related to the entire world war and could not be discussed separately. Therefore, it is necessary to briefly involve Japan's occupation of the Northeast, the relationship between the Axis powers, and the aggression against China. At the same time, it is stated that Japan's aggression against the Soviet Union must be traced back to the historical background before 1928. In 1904, Japan attacked the Russian fleet in Lushun in bad faith and was criticized by world public opinion. The truth of this historical event can be understood today after the Pearl Harbor incident.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 8th] Today, the Soviet Union began its accusations against the main Japanese war criminals, submitting a 65-page statement to the International Tribunal, which accused Japan of violating the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty and said that Emperor Hirohito should be tried as a war criminal. A United Press reporter learned that the Soviet Union will present evidence to prove that the "Tanaka Memorial," which was intended to dominate the world, actually existed.</p>

<h3 id="e81">American Extravagant Lifestyle (Part 2) <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Darlings of Fortune Lavish Money Like Dirt; Scarcity of Goods Exceeds Supply (Translated by Yu Jing)</p>
<p>Trend of Extravagance Sweeps the Nation</p>
<p>Because a change in mental attitude is the trend of the times, all aspects show signs of extreme extravagance. The most obvious example is the church. Many churches have paid off their debts, which is an unprecedented fact in church history. Whenever church members gather, the collection plates are full of checks, and many people voluntarily burn church mortgage notes. The trend of extravagance starts with sports. The number of participants in football, basketball, baseball, track and field events has gradually increased to break any record of the era. People don't mind spending 100 U.S. dollars to watch a boxing match between Louis and Conn. A fat British man named Bruce, who traveled in the United States, said: "The people of America are playing all day long. When do they work?"</p>
<p>Farmers in a certain rural area buy small airplanes to fly around in the fields. Champagne fountains splash at welcome parties for new stars. Car accidents have also reached a new peak, and even crime has exceeded last year's by 16%. In short, everything is setting unprecedented records. The situation in cities and villages throughout the United States has been affected. In Reno, which has a population of only 28,000, a gas station that sold for $22,000 a few years ago has now risen to $300,000. Farmland in a certain area sold for $90 per acre five years ago, but now it is $140 per acre. More than 70 million people have purchased life insurance to protect their lives. For every yacht that is manufactured, there are ten customers who place orders. It is estimated that among the 34 million families in the United States, 14.5 million have savings, and 16 million receive salaries, requiring the purchase of 8 million different kinds of goods.</p>
<p>Black Market Rampant; Price Increases in Disguise</p>
<p>The ban on the black market was enacted 20 years ago, but now it is rampant. In the United States this year, you can get anything you want as long as you have money. For example, to buy a car, it has long been recognized that you must buy other parts, and these parts do not have invoices. If you rent an apartment, it is easy to find an apartment for $50 a month, but the furniture in the room costs $1,500, with only a bed and an old lamp from 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Americans believe that this prosperity will come to an end in about 15 years, because demand will change again in 15 years. What will follow 15 years later? Few people dare to say that it is a stable state of prosperity, and many people think that it must be a "depression." This popular view is not necessarily reliable. They have overlooked various aspects of the problem. For example, the important mechanical industry in the United States is sufficient to maintain over this period, foreign trade may increase, and artificial forces may come to avoid this depression. Most importantly, the country's resources and the planning of needs are sufficient to avoid the advent of this depression.</p>
<p>Because American highways still need to be repaired, schools, hospitals, and bridges need to be increased, river irrigation, flood control, river and harbor improvements, and ditch installations are endless. The 1,077 cities across the country with a population of more than 10,000 all need complete municipal plans. And the whole world needs American products. For example, there are already 100 million orders for American-made locomotives. As long as this production is properly controlled, it may allow the United States to smoothly pass the 15-year mark.</p>
<p>According to general speculation, if prices do not rise by 5% or 10% this year, the terrible depression of the previous 15 years may not occur. If it rises by more than 20%, an economic panic is very likely to occur.</p>

<p>[United Press Munich, 7th] The former German State Secretary, Mrs. Messner, said today: Hitler had an affair with Goebbels' wife and had a son. Before the fall of Berlin, when the Goebbels family committed suicide, this son also died. Goebbels knew that Hitler was the father of this child, so he used this to blackmail him. Currently, only one person knows this secret. The child's name was Helmut, born in 1935. Later, the relationship between the two gradually became estranged, but Hitler was still deeply in love. This child looked very much like his biological father, so Hitler was very concerned.</p>

Airmail (letters and postcards) to the United Kingdom and other European countries (excluding the Soviet Union), the Near East, Africa, and Australia can now be forwarded via Hong Kong. However, airmail letters delivered via this route should be marked "By air via Hongkong" on the envelope by the sender.

<p>In addition, the post office will be closed for one day on National Day according to regulations. The office hours of the Administration and its branches on that day will be in accordance with the Sunday schedule.</p>
<p>According to Wang Guangyu, the assistant manager of the Shanghai Post Office, who spoke to reporters, the post office is actively seeking to expand and improve after the war, but the funding is very tight and the income does not cover the expenses. It relies entirely on central government subsidies, so it has signed a request to the Ministry of Communications to increase postal rates in order to increase revenue. The request has not yet been approved. It was rumored that it would be announced after the National Assembly was convened, but this is not the case. The postal rate increase is currently being discussed and approved by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Power Shortage Diminishes the City's Glamour; Neon Lights Go Out; Industry Representatives Petition the Municipal Government to Lift the Ban <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The neon lights that adorn Shanghai's night market have now dimmed. Last night, reporters drove around the city and found that the neon lights, which used to compete in redness and greenness, and winked their eyes, were no longer visible. The restoration of neon lights in the city was originally decided by the Municipal Advisory Council, with the initial intention of adding to the atmosphere of prosperity after the victory. However, in this time of power shortage, the electricity consumption of factories in the city has been reduced by 25,000 kilowatts each month, and the supply of electric heating to users has also been suspended. It is inevitable that maintaining purely extravagant advertising neon lights will cause psychological resentment among all sectors of society. Zhao Zengyu, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, said: Neon light factories in the city may temporarily switch to fluorescent lamps. The period of limited use is very short, and once the power supply is sufficient, they can be restored at any time.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] More than forty neon electrician units in the city have decided to prepare a written petition to the municipal government, requesting sympathy for the people's difficulties and lifting the restriction on the supply of electricity to neon lights, as they will all be forced to close down due to the authorities' ban on the use of neon lights.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Introduction to the British Trade Delegation to China <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— From the Materials Office of this Newspaper</p>
<p>The British Trade Delegation to China arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday and will stay in Shanghai for several days before proceeding to Nanjing, Hankou, Chongqing, Jinan, Beiping, Kunming, and other places. It is scheduled to return to Shanghai around November 20, and then return home via Guangzhou and Taiwan. He is the head of the British Trade Delegation to China.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Delegation</p>
<p>The purpose of the delegation is to learn about the true situation of general industry and commerce in China, so as to determine the path that future trade between China and the United Kingdom should follow. It is hoped that through contact with various aspects of the Chinese business community, some opinions on the recovery plan will be formed to help China achieve its economic balance. At a time when the Sino-British trade treaty is being negotiated, the mission of this trade delegation is naturally very important for the establishment of future trade relations between China and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The Head of the Delegation is an Expert on Transportation Issues</p>
<p>The British Trade Delegation consists of twelve people, including representatives from all aspects of the British business community, with Sir Bowes as the head. Sir Bowes is an expert on transportation issues and an important figure in the British railway locomotive manufacturing industry. He was born in South Wales in 1895 and participated in the First World War. In 1924, he obtained a master's degree from Oxford University. He has been a Member of Parliament since 1929 until last year. He is currently the Chairman and General Manager of GWR Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Co., Chairman of Gloucester Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Co., Vice Chairman of Gloucester Gas Company, and the person in charge of many other factories. With his rich knowledge and experience, he served as a consultant to the British delegation to the League of Nations early on, and participated in the parliamentary economic visit to Australia. This time</p>
<p>The Origins of the Seven Delegates</p>
<p>Accompanying him are seven other delegates: Mr. Bayliss, a senior official from the British Ministry of Food, who will pay special attention to studying the export of Chinese food; Delegate Busteed, an electrical engineering expert, is currently the Export Manager of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers Association. Last year, when the delegation of the Resources Committee of our country went to the United Kingdom for investigation, he was responsible for liaison; Delegate Morgan, director of William HALE &amp; Sons, represents the general industrial sector of the United Kingdom; Delegate Camigao, a member of the Copper Development Association Council, and Delegate Scothern, director of famous company Torman &amp; Co., represent the British metal industry; Delegate Hanworth represents general British exports, and Delegate Wimbledon is a textile industry expert. In addition, there are experts from the British Trade Association, Mr. Tanton, and delegation secretary Mr. Pellicer, who served as the private secretary of Minister of Commerce Cripps for many years. In addition to the ten people, the delegation also has two female assistant secretaries, namely Miss Lawrance and Miss Morison.</p>
<p>Looking at this list, we can know that the figures included in the delegation represent all sectors such as transportation, electrical industry, metal industry, textile industry, and import and export trade. Then, the importance of this mission representing the country can be imagined.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Wang Manyun's Trial Concluded; Claimed that Serving the Puppet Regime was "Beneficial to the Country"; Puppet Ambassador Chen Jicheng to Be Sentenced Today <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The case of Chen Jicheng, who served as puppet ambassador to Manchuria, chairman of the puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and chairman of the puppet Border Affairs Committee, has been concluded by the High Court and is scheduled to be sentenced at 2:30 PM today.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The case of Wang Manyun, suspected of being a traitor, was concluded by the High Court yesterday and is scheduled to be sentenced at 2:30 PM on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Wang was formerly the principal of Shanghai Pudong Municipal School. He started serving the puppet regime in August of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939] and served as Deputy Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Social Affairs, Permanent Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration, Permanent Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, Deputy Secretary-General of the Puppet Rural Clearance Committee, and Director of the Puppet Executive Yuan Rural Clearance Affairs Bureau until the end of the war. The prosecutor's indictment charged Wang with organizing the masses to resist the central government while serving as Deputy Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Social Affairs; increasing production to provide supplies to the enemy while serving as Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture; and being responsible for eliminating our underground workers while serving as Deputy Secretary-General of the Puppet Rural Clearance Committee and Director of the Puppet Rural Clearance Affairs Bureau. In summary, his actions should be punished according to law.</p>
<p>Wang, wearing a blue silk padded robe and black satin shoes, argued eloquently in court yesterday: "In the 28th year of the Republic [1939], Mr. Du Yuesheng wrote to me, instructing me to send someone to infiltrate the puppet organization. However, because there was no one to send at the time, I volunteered to join the puppet government, so my motivation was very pure and completely based on a patriotic standpoint. When I joined the puppet government as Deputy Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Social Affairs, there were no masses to organize. During my tenure as Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Judicial Administration, all I did were routine official duties and I did not often go to the ministry to work. When I was Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, the country was devastated, and there was only one farm for experimentation. The food supply was handled by a separate Food Committee, so there was no question of increasing production to provide supplies to the enemy. The Deputy Secretary-General of the Puppet Rural Clearance Committee was just that, a deputy secretary-general. All I did on a daily basis was secretarial work, and I did not know about how the rural clearance work was initiated. At that time, the military was in charge of the enemy, and the administration was in charge of the puppet regime, but the puppet government at the time was anti-communist, so the administrative work of rural clearance was also based on this. The Rural Clearance Affairs Bureau was an internal agency of the puppet Executive Yuan, not a subordinate agency, so it had no seal or official stamp. As the name suggests, the director was responsible for administrative matters. If I was responsible for eliminating underground workers as the prosecutor stated, then it should be called the Rural Clearance Bureau, not the Rural Clearance Affairs Bureau. The rural clearance work in each province was the sole responsibility of the Rural Clearance Commissioners in each province. Therefore, my participation in the puppet government was partly based on orders and partly on my own</p>
<p>Desire for Recognition</p>
<p>I wanted to do something for the country. There was no intention of colluding with the enemy at all. The work I did in a positive way after taking up a puppet position can be divided into as many as nine items, such as providing intelligence. Mr. Wu Kaixian testified to the court last time that 'He told me to pass it on to the central government. Unless it wasn't sent, everything that was sent was accurate.' Therefore, it can be said that the reason why the central government's underground workers have not been threatened in recent years is entirely due to the power of the defendant's intelligence. Other examples include dividing Li Shiqun and Ding Mocun, causing them to suspect and be jealous of each other, which made underground work much easier. Other examples include rescuing Wan Molin, Wu Kaixian, Jiang Bocheng and other important underground workers, all of which have proof. In addition, I escorted Mrs. Du Yuesheng and others to the mainland, prevented others from joining the puppet regime, transported supplies to the interior, participated in defection work, and assisted in maintaining public order after the victory. Based on all these facts, there was only collusion with my own country to conspire against the enemy country. The defendant once used the alias 'Those who can and cannot,' which means that the body can be humiliated, but the will cannot be moved; the family can be destroyed, but the country cannot be lost. Therefore, I feel that I have done nothing to be ashamed of the country." The two lawyers, Chen Junrui and Jiang Rong, defended him, saying: "After the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, the defendant participated in confidential work and then went to Chongqing and Hong Kong. But why did he return to Shanghai? This part of the story has been explained by Mr. Du Yuesheng in court last time. Now, studying the inside story of the general cases of suspected traitors, it can be divided into two categories. One is to do it for a reason, that is, to be entrusted with a mission by the central government and to join the puppet government. The other is to do it for no reason, that is, to willingly surrender without any mission. The defendant in this case did it for a reason, so the court should investigate clearly."</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The second distribution of raw cane sugar by the Public School Personnel Goods Distribution Office in the city ended on the 5th of this month. Yesterday, according to the director of the office, Yin Tiyang, the procedures for the office to pay the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for the goods have been completed. The office will start issuing the goods on the basis of the delivery order at 9:00 AM on the 12th of this month. Because there are a large number of people who are eligible to purchase the sugar, in order to avoid overcrowding, the dates of pick-up are arranged according to the time of payment. Each organization is requested to send personnel to the temporary warehouse of the office at 184 Maho Road to pick up the goods. Those who purchase less than 100 kilograms must provide their own cloth bags. The pick-up date schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Payment Date</p>
<p>September 30th</p>

<h3 id="e95">Seeking to Resolve Unemployment Panic: Public Works Projects Recommended - Zhao Zengjue's Views on Eliminating Rickshaws <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the gradual elimination of rickshaws in the city, a reporter visited Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, yesterday. According to Zhao, from the perspective of the trend of the times and in terms of efficiency, the elimination of rickshaws is inevitable. Zhao cited an example, stating that an ordinary rickshaw is about three meters long and one meter wide, occupying an area of three square meters. Traveling from the "Throwing Ball Field" to the Bund takes about fifteen minutes, with an efficiency of forty-five square meter-minutes. In contrast, a person on a tram occupies only one square meter, and traveling from the "Throwing Ball Field" to the Bund takes only five minutes, with an efficiency of only five square meter-minutes, a difference of nine times. In terms of municipal construction, public transportation should be promoted to increase efficiency. However, given the current social situation, eliminating rickshaws presents its own difficulties. Public transportation is not yet as ideal as it should be, and the situation in factories is also poor, unable to accommodate a large number of workers. Therefore, the Municipal Affairs Conference has decided to postpone the ban on rickshaws until January of next year. However,</p>
<p>Delivery Dates:</p>
<p>October 12</p>
<p>October 12</p>
<p>October 13</p>
<p>October 14</p>
<p>October 16</p>
<p>October 17</p>
<p>October 18</p>
<p>October 19</p>
<p>October 20</p>
<p>The number of rickshaw pullers using the vehicles will be registered, and in mid-November, a lottery will determine which tenth will be eliminated first. Unemployed rickshaw pullers will be assisted by the Social Affairs Bureau, which will provide small loans to enable them to engage in small businesses. According to Director Zhao, public works projects can be undertaken to absorb unemployed workers and accommodate demobilized soldiers, as the post-war destruction has been severe and all construction projects are awaiting commencement. Moreover, opening factories faces many difficulties with raw materials and machinery, making public works projects easier to implement.</p>

<p>[Another Report] The Social Affairs Bureau has decided to adopt a lottery system to ban rickshaws in batches. The first batch of tickets drawn, those with the number "5" at the end, will be eliminated, expected to amount to over two thousand six hundred vehicles. The Rickshaw Guild believes that banning rickshaws will inevitably increase the number of unemployed laborers, and that most rickshaw pullers are from northern Jiangsu province, unable to return home. If a ban is implemented, the people of northern Jiangsu will suffer even greater hardship in their lives. Therefore, the guild has been urgently requesting various government agencies and the Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association to forward their request to the authorities, asking them to postpone the ban and implement a gradual ban from 1950 to 1953, as decided by the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Shui Xiangyun's Opinion: Establish Training Classes <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions, expressed his opinion on the elimination of rickshaws, stating that there are two prerequisites: (1) a proper solution to the re-employment of rickshaw pullers, and (2) dispersing rickshaws from the city to other cities that still need them. Shui suggested establishing re-employment training classes for rickshaw pullers to train them in driving cars and repairing machinery, which could be effective in the short term. If the authorities have not yet prepared proper follow-up measures, he hopes that implementation will be postponed to avoid increasing unemployment and affecting social stability.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] To increase the fundraising for the Allied Victory Public Debt, the Ministry of Finance has sent a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Government to continue fundraising, stating: "Shanghai is the economic center and commercial hub of the country. During the war, many merchants regretted not being able to subscribe to the various Allied debts issued by the government. Now that we are rebuilding the country after recovery and funds are urgently needed, launching another fundraising campaign for the 30-year Allied Debt in Shanghai will surely attract enthusiastic subscribers. The 80 million yuan already raised is not a large sum and does not seem sufficient to demonstrate their patriotic fervor. The debt amount is now increased to 500 million yuan. In addition to assigning quotas to real estate managers, professionals, and wealthy gentlemen who have not yet been assigned, the various commercial associations that have already been assigned quotas should also have their quotas appropriately increased. Furthermore, in the past, the industrial sector in Shanghai, and especially the workers, always responded first to donation campaigns. Relevant agencies should be consulted to assist in promoting fundraising so that the fundraising campaign can be broadly expanded and achieve significant results." It is reported that the Standing Committee intends to follow the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, consider the actual situation, and adopt three methods: "supplementary assignment," "increased assignment," and "fundraising promotion," inviting heads of municipal commercial associations, responsible persons from various trade associations with strong financial resources, enthusiastic local gentlemen, and leaders from all sectors to enthusiastically subscribe.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Bozhuang, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, returned to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. Chen remained silent about the Railway Bureau case and made no comment. This is because Chen took the initiative to investigate the Railway Bureau case, rather than initiating the investigation after outside informants reported it. Since the case has been handed over to the court and a judgment is expected soon, he does not wish to make any defense.</p>
<p>The restoration plan for the Railway Bureau will be completed by the end of February next year. The main goal is to ensure traffic safety, striving to avoid malfunctions and ensure on-time arrivals. The improvement plan will take about a year, mainly focusing on modernization, adding new equipment, and replacing new sleepers. Currently, the two lines need to replace approximately two to three hundred thousand sleepers.</p>
<p>The mobile clinics of the two lines are currently planning to expand their services to provide medical care to the people of various towns and villages.</p>

<p>The Land Bureau has decided that the general land registration for the six districts of Huangpu, Hunan, Zhabei, Fahua, Yinxiang, and Caojing will close at the end of this month. Those who fail to register by the deadline or fail to provide a reason to the bureau will be considered to have abandoned the land and will not be allowed to transfer ownership, freezing their buying responsibilities. The government will gradually take over these lands and make them public property. According to Zhu Pingyu, Director of the Land Bureau, the general land registration for the six districts of Huangpu, etc., has been underway for over ten months. According to central regulations, it must be completed within two months. Shanghai, due to its complex environment and to accommodate the difficulties of the people, has repeatedly postponed the deadline. As the delay has been too long from the period stipulated by the central government, it must be concluded. Generally, land in the suburbs has been fully registered with the bureau. Most of the urban areas have also been registered. Only a small portion has not been registered. After the general registration for these six districts is completed, the Land Bureau will begin the general land registration for the Pudong District at the beginning of next year.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to police statistics, since the implementation of the traffic improvement measures in the central district of Shanghai, fines for vehicle violations have reached over 40 million yuan in the past twenty days. At the beginning of the implementation of the improvement measures, daily fines often reached 3 to 4 million. Recently, fines have gradually decreased, and the number of accidents has also decreased. The traffic situation in the central district has further improved. In addition, the police bureau has frequently dispatched jeeps to patrol the streets to assist in promoting the traffic improvement measures. However, the bureau lacks such vehicles. To increase work efficiency, the police bureau has decided to use the more than 40 million yuan in vehicle violation fines to purchase new vehicles, preparing to purchase two jeeps for regular patrol use.</p>

Then, General Egerton, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) office in China, delivered a speech, humbly stating that he had only recently arrived and had limited knowledge of relief work, but he greatly admired Director Jiang's work ethic. Next, Ms. Price of the American Relief Mission to China delivered a speech, also praising Jiang's work.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Jiang delivered a reply amidst warm applause from the entire venue, stating that he was truly unworthy of the grand farewell and gifts given by everyone. The work of the Executive Yuan is difficult, and all of you have come with a spirit of service, not hesitating to make various sacrifices. He would like to express his deep gratitude here. The Executive Yuan has no bureaucratic habits, and those who want to become officials will definitely not come to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Jiang repeatedly urged his colleagues not to have a sense of sadness. "While it cannot be said to be based on any evidence that the Chinese nation is the most outstanding in the world, we should not belittle ourselves. Seeing the efforts of all of you working in the Executive Yuan, I can only feel inspired."</p>
<p>Jiang emphasized the importance of the Executive Yuan's work, saying, "If our work succeeds, countless compatriots' lives can be saved. Conversely, if our work is neglected or relaxed, tens of millions of compatriots will perish in ravines!"</p>
<p>After Jiang's speech, many people rushed forward to shake hands with Jiang and express their farewells. When asked about his plans, Jiang said that he planned to take a two-month break first, and then make a decision, stating in a firm and definite tone: "I have decided to return to school."</p>
<p>As for the personnel of the Executive Yuan, Deputy Director Pu Xuefeng's resignation has been approved and Zheng Daoru will succeed him; Deputy Director Li Chemin's intention to resign remains firm, only agreeing to "stay for a few weeks." It is said that Wu Bannong has been internally designated as his successor. Director Huo also announced yesterday that Lu Hanqin will be the director of the Secretariat and Wu Guanxiong will be the secretary. More announcements are expected in the coming days. Furthermore, Director Huo is scheduled to hold his first press conference after taking office at the Duchen Hotel at 3 p.m. today.</p>
<p>[Nanjing, 8th] Pu Xuefeng, the Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan who recently resigned along with Jiang Tingfu, said: Tsinghua and other schools have recently sent telegrams inviting him to teach, but as he is suffering from a minor illness, he plans to rest briefly. He is not expected to leave Beijing in the short term. As for future writing plans, he may start writing again when he returns to school to teach in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Evaluation of Woolen Yarn Prices: Review Meeting Held Yesterday <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>To equalize woolen yarn prices, the Social Affairs Bureau organized a Woolen Yarn Price Review Committee and held its first inaugural meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday. The committee included representatives from the competent authorities, commercial and industrial groups, and public opinion organizations. Its task is to review and determine reasonable woolen yarn prices based on the cost of goods and with reference to the Shanghai market. This price is limited to wholesale within the industry. If wholesale prices within the industry exceed the negotiated price, the committee will recommend that the municipal government take necessary action. Those who attended yesterday included Pan Shihao, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Chen Qien, representative of the Woolen Textile Dyeing Industry Association, Shen Laizhou, Sun Guizhou, Zhang Yiping, representatives of the Woolen Yarn Commercial Association, Tang Hexiang, representative of the Binfeng Woolen Mill, Deng Zhonghe, representative of the Anle Textile Mill, Li Runsheng, representative of the Yumin Woolen Yarn Mill, and Zhu Jixiang, representative of the Ewo Textile Co., Ltd., and other personnel totaling more than ten people. Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Manufacturers State Their Difficulties</p>
<p>First, the manufacturers stated their current difficulties: (1) the source of raw materials is not smooth, and wool must be supplied from foreign countries, with no standard price. (2) The cost is rising, the cost of living is rising in a straight line, wage expenses are huge, interest rates are too high, and there is a lack of working capital. (3) Electricity is limited. The total electricity consumption for woolen yarn production is only 761 kW, so they requested that the restrictions be lifted. (4) The loss of machinery during the wartime occupation has not yet been restored, and the production of various factories has shrunk, less than one-tenth of what it was before the war.</p>
<p>Conduct Preliminary Investigation Before Setting Prices</p>
<p>Distributors said that they suffered heavy losses from the enemy's price control policy during the occupation period. After the victory, they were affected by the currency system, and they sacrificed even more due to Commander-in-Chief He's efforts to stabilize commodity prices on September 28 of last year. Therefore, they requested that no rigid price limits be imposed. Currently, the threat to the industry is the lack of inventory and the lack of smooth sources, followed by the temporary stores that speculate temporarily, affecting the industry's operations.</p>
<p>Later, Director Gu explained the price negotiation system, stating that it was not a rigid price limit, and studied the investigation matters. It was determined that the meeting would be held once every two weeks, and prices would be negotiated at the next meeting.</p>
<p>In addition, the Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee organized by the bureau is scheduled to be established this afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Garrison Headquarters Improves Reception of Reporters: Three Measures Agreed Upon <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Twenty-three reporters from various newspapers in Shanghai, citing the inconvenience for reporters to conduct interviews for military news at the Garrison Headquarters, jointly sent an open letter to Commander Xuan a few days ago, requesting facilitation of interviews to achieve the purpose of freedom of the press. Commander Xuan immediately replied publicly, publishing it in various newspapers in Shanghai yesterday. The reporters felt that Commander Xuan's reply contained many misunderstandings of the reporters' intentions, and the requests made were not accepted, expressing dissatisfaction. They held another meeting yesterday and immediately drafted a reply to Commander Xuan, sending it to various newspapers for publication today. Feng Youzhen, the representative of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Shanghai, heard about this and attached great importance to it. Feng believed that the Garrison Headquarters originally had no intention of deliberately creating difficulties for reporters interviewing the department's news. However, the various inconveniences encountered by reporters when interviewing the department's news were indeed true. The main reason was that the communication between the department's staff and reporters was not close enough, and the methods of releasing news were lacking in technical aspects. These shortcomings can be easily improved through consultation. Therefore, he stepped in to mediate. With the consent of the Garrison Headquarters, the department will provide as much convenience as possible for reporters from various newspapers to interview the department's news in the future, and three measures were agreed upon: (1) The department will distribute passes to reporters from various newspapers who cover military news. (2) Reporters from various newspapers can enter the reception rooms of various departments of the department. (3) The guards at the gate will be strictly ordered to improve their attitude towards reporters. The reporters expressed satisfaction with the Garrison Headquarters' measures and unanimously decided not to publish the reply to Commander Xuan, which was originally scheduled to be published today.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Renji Hospital Raises Funds: Yan Huiquing Hosted a Gathering Yesterday with a Goal of 200 Million Yuan, Already Obtaining 80 Million <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Renji Hospital of this city, founded to this day, has a history of over a hundred years, and for many years, British individuals have held primary responsibility. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the board of directors was reorganized, with Chinese individuals holding sixteen seats and British individuals holding nine seats, with Dr. Yan Huiqing serving as chairman of the board. Yesterday (the 8th) at 5 PM, Dr. Yan invited representatives from all sectors of the city at the International Hotel's second floor to discuss matters related to raising funds for the hospital. Attendees included Mayor Wu Guozhen, City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Jiangsu Inspector Cheng Cangbo, Deputy General of the Customs Service Ding Guitang, Director of the Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan, Director of the Health Bureau Zhang Wei, as well as prominent figures Dong Yinzhang, Cui Pingxi, Lu Meiseng, Xu Zhendong, Wang Qiyu, Sun Duanhuang, Zhan Peilin, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Weijing, Tang Xinghai, Xu Xiekang, Wu Yiran, and foreign guests, totaling approximately fifty people. First, Chairman Yan of the hospital reported on the process of reorganization and the current situation, praising the hospital as the earliest founded hospital in China. He noted that most good hospitals cannot be self-sufficient because their purpose is to help the poor, so he hoped that all sectors would actively contribute to the funding.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then expressed his views, praising the reorganization of the hospital's board of directors, stating that this was in accordance with the new regulations set by the central government, requiring that both the chairman of the board and the hospital director be Chinese. However, he emphasized that rights and obligations must go hand in hand, and that in the past, Renji Hospital was managed by foreigners who were responsible for raising funds. Now that the hospital has been taken over by us, we should naturally fulfill our obligations. He added that all those present were known for their generosity, and he hoped that they would all provide assistance so that Dr. Yan's wishes could be realized as scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Elliston Reports on History <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Following Mayor Wu's speech, which ended with applause, Dr. E.S. Elliston, the British representative on the hospital board, reported on the history of the hospital, stating that Renji Hospital was founded in 1844, and its first fundraising effort took place in 1846, exactly one hundred years ago. At that time, the donation amount that the major benefactors were responsible for was five silver dollars per year. In 1850, the total annual expenses of the hospital were 533 yuan, which jumped to 750 yuan two years later. The founder of Renji Hospital was Dr. Lockhart, a British man who purchased a small plot of land between Fujian Road and Shandong Road and built a thatched house, single-handedly treating Chinese and foreign patients. Later, due to the small size of the house, it needed to be expanded (near Fujian Road, i.e., the current site), and a new building was constructed at a cost of 3,500 yuan. At that time, the total amount of donations from all sectors was only over 2,000 yuan, and the missing 1,000 yuan was borrowed from a bank at an interest rate of six percent. The total cost of moving from the old site to the new site was 13 yuan in legal tender. Since then, the hospital has been in deficit every year. However, Dr. Elliston said that every reasonable hospital will inevitably be in deficit. Hospitals that truly serve the people will never deposit money in the bank. And the best hospital directors are never those who sit idly in their offices all day! Dr. Elliston concluded by saying that the reason he listed all the past events was to arouse everyone's interest in the hospital and provide assistance. The British have created a hundred years of history for Renji Hospital. After the Chinese take over, he hoped that the future of Renji Hospital would be even more brilliant.</p>
<p>It is reported that the fundraising goal of Renji Hospital this time is 200 million yuan, of which about 80 million yuan has been raised. Rong Hongyuan, the nephew of Rong Desheng, has contributed the largest amount, 50 million yuan. Dr. Yan distributed many donation books at yesterday's meeting and is confident that the full amount will be raised soon.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Forging Documents to Steal Coal: A Flaw Was Revealed During Transportation <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] At approximately 4 PM on the 6th, the Xinshijie Precinct of the Municipal Police Bureau intercepted two trucks transporting stolen coal. The trucks were loaded with ten tons of coal. A man claiming to be a soldier, carrying forged identification, escorted the trucks. As they were passing Sanmin Road at the intersection of the Athletic Association Road, they were intercepted by the local substation for inspection. The man jumped out of the truck, claiming to be Zhu Jiakui (27 years old, from Shaoxing), a lieutenant serving in the General Office of the Logistics Headquarters. Zhu claimed that the coal was for the military and should not be interfered with. Officer Guo politely replied that he was under orders to inspect. Zhu Jiakui unhesitatingly reached into his pocket and produced a piece of identification. Officer Guo examined it for a long time and noticed that the title of Zhu on the card and the identification did not match. Realizing that it was forged, he questioned him severely. Zhu stammered, showing signs of guilt, and turned to flee. He hastily jumped onto the front truck and sped away. The truck behind also accelerated and followed. At this time, the police officers were convinced that they were transporting stolen coal and quickly pursued them on bicycles to near Hongkou Park, where they managed to intercept the rear coal truck (number 35622) and apprehended two plainclothes men. Zhu escaped in the front truck. The truck and the two men were taken to the precinct for interrogation, where the precinct chief, Ni Huanan, personally questioned them. According to the two suspects, the two trucks they hired were rented from the Yiyuan Transportation Company. They claimed to be only responsible for transportation, loading the goods from Jiangwan First Warehouse and transporting them to Zhu's residence at Lane 632, No. 792 Kangding Road in Huxi. They claimed to know nothing else. Based on this clue, the head of the criminal division, Wang Haozai, along with officers Cui Yifan, Zheng Jingcheng, Wang Zhigang, and Lü Wenxuan, were immediately dispatched to the above location to stake out. Zhu returned to his residence at around 6 AM the next morning and was arrested and taken to the precinct for questioning. At first, he tried to pass the blame onto the two men, claiming that he was just helping them transport the goods and that they were the ones who claimed to be soldiers. However, when questioned about the forged documents, Zhu was at a loss for words and confessed to the theft. The precinct is currently compiling the record of the interrogation and plans to hand over the entire case and the suspects to the preparatory department for handling this morning.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Answering Readers: Legal Questions <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>(1) Refusing to Accept Rent</p>
<p>Yang Chuheng asks: I previously rented a house from a certain property management office. The lease was due to expire at the end of June this year, and I had discussed renewal procedures with the property management office at that time. However, the property management office stated that continuing the lease would require an increase in rent and the payment of a large handling fee, to which I did not agree. The office has now refused to accept rent for two months. I have several questions and would be grateful for your guidance: (1) Does my inability to pay the large handling fee constitute a waiver of my leasehold rights? Can the property management office terminate the lease on this basis? (2) Can I deposit the refused rent in a bank on their behalf? (3) In the absence of a lease agreement stating otherwise, does the original lessee have the right to continue the lease? (4) If the rent continues to be refused, what should I do according to the law? (5) If the property management office disregards everything and forces me to move out, are there any legal remedies or protections available?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui's Answer] (1) If a fixed-term lease agreement expires and the lessor has negotiated terms with the lessee, it is clear that the lessor is willing to continue the lease. The municipal government has set standards for rent, so the term of the lease is the only key point of negotiation between the two parties. The so-called handling fee should not be a large sum, and should not be used as a condition for lease if it is a disguised form of key money? However, before a new lease is signed, the lessor may deny the lessee's right to lease on the grounds that the old lease relationship has been terminated and the new lease relationship has not been established. (2) The method of depositing in a bank is now very common, and its effect is to prove that you are not neglecting your obligation to pay. (3) If the lease agreement does not contain any records of being able to continue the lease after the expiration date, you cannot simply rely on the lease agreement to claim the right to continue the lease. (4) If forced eviction occurs, and the act violates criminal law, you can file a private prosecution according to the private prosecution procedure.</p>

<h3 id="e121">City Chamber of Commerce Cables the Executive Yuan to Exempt Native Cloth from Business Tax: No Loss to Tax Revenue, Beneficial to Sales <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The City Chamber of Commerce cabled the Executive Yuan requesting the exemption of native cloth from business tax, stating: "According to a letter from the Local Cloth Business Association of this city: Native cloth is originally the only sideline of farmers and is also a unique domestic product of our people. It is woven by women and mostly worn by poor people. Both supply and demand sides belong to the poor class, so the business tax on artificial hand-woven native cloth has always been reduced or exempted. As far back as the warlord era, although donations and taxes were heavy, native cloth was once exempted from likin. In recent times, such as the enemy puppet era, although extortion was rampant, native cloth was also spared harsh harassment. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, when the national government established its capital in Nanjing, it issued an order to the whole country to permanently exempt native cloth from likin tax. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, after deliberation by the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan issued an order to all provinces and cities to exempt native cloth from business tax. The clear orders have become a fixed case. The government's intention to promote domestic goods and protect people's livelihood can be seen. The pain that cloth merchants are suffering is waiting to be resolved, but the unexpected burden of cloth merchants has suddenly revived. Despite repeated orders, permanent exemptions, and uniform exemptions from business tax on native cloth, the tax is being levied again. Although the Taihui has repeatedly petitioned, it has not yet been approved. The industry is in a panic, and they tell each other in distress. It is feared that cloth merchants will eventually affect the weavers. Both production and sales will inevitably perish together. After the catastrophe, people's livelihood is urgent. We beg your council to forward to the Executive Yuan for approval to investigate the established case and permanently exempt, etc. to the meeting. Native cloth is coarse yarn hand-woven, the scale is narrower, and is durable, is a rural side industry. The native cloth industry before the war was exempted by your court in previous orders. Article 41 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Business Tax Law promulgated by your court at its 579th meeting on January 19, 32nd year of the Republic of China, stipulates: "After the implementation of the Business Tax Law and these Detailed Rules, all provincial business tax separate regulations and the Ministry of Finance and various provinces previously approved for reduction, exemption, and deferral of business tax shall be abolished." From then on, the established case of native cloth exemption from business tax was also abolished. Paying taxes according to the rate is due to the fact that military needs were urgent during the war, and fundraising was in full swing, so we had to broaden the tax collection path. Now that the War of Resistance has ended for more than a year, the business tax, which was classified as centrally managed at that time, has been transferred to the local government for management in accordance with the revised financial revenue and expenditure system. Regarding the established case of native cloth exemption from tax before the war: we propose that your court still approve the recovery by explicit order. This matter will not harm the central government's tax revenue, but will benefit the sale of native cloth. The rural areas after the war are devastated, and the vitality has not recovered. Reducing the burden of native cloth will indirectly protect the livelihood of rural areas. We only hope that you will adopt our humble suggestions and implement them resolutely."</p>

<p>Foreign currency, the US dollar, is stable and the British pound is strong, not deviating from the old path of the previous day. The exchange rate for US dollars is still shouted at 3,500 yuan to 3,530 yuan, but transactions can only be completed after the sellers receive income, so it is still a situation of having a price but no market. The off-market black market price is still between 4,000 yuan and 4,100 yuan, which is also relatively sluggish. The result is similar to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars are also extremely stable, struggling at the previous price without any gains or losses. The Hong Kong exchange rate has risen slightly due to the return of telegrams from Shanghai, and was sold at 925 yuan yesterday. The Indian exchange rate is 1,100 to 1,130 yuan, and the British exchange rate is 14,500 yuan to 15,000 yuan. Transactions are still difficult to develop. The official exchange rate for the US dollar has not changed, but direct trading is still unheard of.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of gold first weakened and then stabilized. There were signs of easing in the money market, coupled with the payment of taxes by the Guangbang, which led to this. The initial price was around 2.16 million, with a large number of offers, and it was once seen at 2.155 million, but it soon stabilized and rose slightly. After 10 o'clock, the central bank sold 100 bars at a price of 2.165 million. There were no major changes after this. Later, due to the easing of the money market and the large difference between the Hong Kong and Shanghai gold prices, there were slightly more buyers. Around noon, the price rebounded to 2.195 million before being pressured and weakened slightly. At noon, it stood at around 2.185 million. In the afternoon, the buying interest was strong again, and the overnight transaction price rose to 2.22 million, resulting in a rebound of 53,000. Ornamental gold was 234,000, silver was 3,400, silver dollars were unchanged, and the underground short-term money market was slightly relaxed, but the underground interest rate still needed 1.6 to 2 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of public bonds stabilized again. General financial buyers continued to pay, but there were not many chips, and it was easy to pull up the price. Unified Class C opened at 1,900 yuan. After continuous absorption by scattered buyers, the price rose well to 2,330 yuan before slightly turning. Finally, it hovered around 2,250 yuan. The result was a rise of 320 yuan compared to the previous closing. Class A and B continued to rise by 150 yuan, and Class D and E rose well by 100 yuan. The transaction volume was about 6 million yuan in face value.</p>

<p>The situation of foreign stocks changed, and the rise and fall of each stock were uneven and different. Ewo Yarns was the most stable, rising from 9,800 yuan to the 10,000 yuan mark. As a result, Ewo Yarns rose by half a percentage point compared to the previous close. British United Paper and Shipping rose. Jardine Matheson and Guangmao were average. Cold stocks were quite popular and relatively lively.</p>

<p>Although the factory's purchase price has requested an increase, the foreign firms and real sales accounts were very sluggish, so those who urgently wanted to sell had to depreciate the price. Yesterday, the city's various stalls were short of 50,000 to more than 100,000 yuan. The market price of silk goods was frustrated due to the weakness of raw materials. The real silk goods were even weaker. Yesterday, the artificial silk goods still maintained the original price of the previous day.</p>

<p>The knitted industry in this city is stepping up production recently due to the approaching winter. In addition to adding new machinery, each factory is also planning to develop sales in Southeast Asia. Some manufacturers have gone to Hong Kong to set up offices in preparation for export. Before the war, the average monthly production of the knitted industry in this city was 300,000 dozen, of which 170,000 dozen were sold in Southeast Asia, exceeding the number in the country, so the industry is preparing to promote trade in Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>The China Farmers Bank has approved the request of tea merchants in southern Anhui to borrow tea refining loans in accordance with the Pingshui District method. However, Qimen tea has already been packed into boxes, and the funds of manufacturers are concentrated on the tea itself. The transportation costs cannot be raised at present. The China Farmers Bank has also agreed to consider lending freight costs of 10,000 yuan per load. As of recently, the number of tea houses applying for loans is 16 in the Pingshui District, totaling 1.2 billion yuan, and 20 in the Tunxi District, totaling 500 million yuan. The funds for Pingshui will be issued this week, and the funds for Tunxi may be remitted before the 20th of this month.</p>

<p>[Our Report] In August, 5,000 tons of Vietnamese rice arrived in Shanghai. There were no imports in September. According to the confirmed news from the French Postal Shipping Company, a large amount will arrive in Shanghai this month. The first ship, the Panchini Yutipi Haini, loaded 3,700 tons of rice from Saigon at the end of last month and set sail for Shanghai. It is expected to arrive at the port today or tomorrow. The rice was also purchased by the Central Trust Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e130">New Textile Fiber Invented by British Scientists <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 8th] Britain has recently invented a new type of textile fiber, which is different from other natural and artificial fibers. It is named "Terylene." Its ingredients are obtained from chemicals. The material is strong and has special heat resistance and is easy to spin into knitting. Terylene is the result of the research of scientists at the Manchester Calico Printing Association Research Institute. The association has handed over the invention to the British Imperial Chemical Industries Co., Ltd. to improve it and sell it to the market. It is said that preliminary work is currently being carried out in the laboratory. A large amount of production will take a considerable amount of time.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Money is Still Tight: Yarn and Cloth Have Not Escaped the Slump: Fangjian's Opening Cloth is Also Cheaper Than the Previous Period <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market turned stable. In the early morning, it continued the downward trend of the previous day and continued to fall by 50,000 yuan. Then, the Hakka helped take advantage of the cheap absorption, so it was able to stop falling and rebound. The gains and losses of 20-count and 16-count yarn were mixed, roughly the same as the previous day. 42-count thread was about 60,000 to 70,000 yuan lower. 42-count Blue Phoenix spot goods were 3.08 million yuan, futures were 3 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse was 2.04 million yuan, and heavyweight was 2.12 million yuan. Because the money is still tight, although the supply of joint sales is not large, the price is still weak and unable to rise. In this situation, I am afraid that there is no hope of recovery before the National Day commemoration. The cloth market is becoming increasingly unreal, and the price is also falling more and more. Today is also the opening sales period of Fangjian, and the listed prices are cheaper than the previous period. Applicants for purchase are not enthusiastic, which is due to the fact that this street and the Hakka sales are still sluggish, and the money is extremely tight, so they cannot move forward, and the price is also falling frequently. Yesterday, the market price of Longxian fine cloth was 84,000 yuan, Yanghe and 3A Caqiu fine cloth was 78,000 to 79,000 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Yuan Bijia was 88,000 yuan. The price of fine cloth in various stalls has generally fallen by about 120,000 yuan compared to the peak.</p>
<p>Shu Yinzhang, general manager of Fangjian Company, convened a work review meeting of the persons in charge of Fangjian factories under his control at 3 pm yesterday to strengthen production work. There was a detailed discussion on the issues of strengthening management and increasing productivity. It was not until around 6 pm that the meeting dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Hong Kong Export Restrictions: Part Has Been Canceled <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 7th] The Hong Kong government has announced the cancellation of restrictions on a variety of export goods, which is the prelude to the restoration of normal trade relations between Hong Kong and South China. Although the quantity and importance of freely exported goods are not very large, businessmen generally welcome the government's announcement and the true recognition that Hong Kong's trade must develop. Hong Kong's prosperity has always been closely related to South China's trade, but since the liberation of Hong Kong, it has been difficult to develop due to various restrictions imposed by governments. The following goods are still prohibited from export: grain, cotton yarn, piece goods, alkali, glass plates, auto parts, refrigerators, rubber, wood, newsprint, and printing materials. However, the following items are excluded: (1) Newsprint, glass (weighing no more than 18 ounces), and coconut oil, which are designated as a portion of all imported goods for export, (2) Piece goods that have been withdrawn from the warehouse by the Chief of Supplies.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Woolen Cloth is Stable <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hakka sales of woolen cloth were more relaxed, but the needs of various weaving factories on this street were still not weak. The trend of each cargo, except for Melton herringbone artificial cotton and silk grass green gabardine, etc., has slightly turned flat and weak. The rest have always been stable. The news of buying full wool suit flannel and overcoat flannel is even stronger. The industry is very optimistic because the arrival of goods is scarce, and the circulation of goods in the market is thin. Those who do not use high-interest loans are easily unwilling to sell.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Rice Prices Are Flat, Grain and Oil are Sluggish: Hetao Rice Boats Resumed Receiving Rice Yesterday <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The digestion of the rice market has turned sluggish. The registration of Hakka goods was more than 6,700 stones. Indica rice continued to fall by more than 1,000 yuan. Although the source of japonica rice is small, the people's hearts are also softening. Baiyuan's arrival and digestion are both flat, and the market situation is established. Yinyuan increased the killing. Yesterday, Hetao rice boats began to resume receiving rice and the authorities sent police to assist in preventing labor conflicts. The flour mills are limited to shipping goods per day, and the black market is no longer easy to operate. Wheat is in a slump and has not been opened. Bran's rise and fall are mutual. Small packages have returned to a slight fatigue of 100 to 200 yuan. Scattered warehouses are slightly firm by more than 100 yuan. Bean cakes have few transactions in both foreign ports and on this street, returning to a slight 200 to 300 yuan. The supply of soybean oil and rapeseed oil from the factory in the oil market is gradually increasing, and the source of raw oil on the market is seeing prosperity, and it continues to fall by more than 1,000 yuan. The sales of soybeans are also weak, falling by 1,000 yuan. Broad beans have also returned slightly by 1,000 yuan. Broad beans are temporarily lacking in gains and losses. Red grain wineries have reduced their intake, returning to a slight 500 to 600 yuan. Raw kernels have fallen and stabilized, but as soon as the goods arrive, they still have to be small.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Wheat Trading: Grain Merchants Request Preservation <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to prevent wheat transactions from entering the right track recently, and the mutual buying and selling between firms to promote speculation and raise prices, ordered the Grain Industry Association to strictly prohibit it in order to stabilize the market. However, the grain industry believes that the buying and selling between wheat firms has become a convention. If you want to suppress the rise in wheat, you must prohibit exports. A special emergency meeting was called yesterday to solicit opinions. All said that the source of wheat in the market is purchased and transported to Shanghai by various member firms operating in transportation and sales, and the sales are sold to various flour mills and merchants through various member firms operating in distribution. Over the years, mutual buying and selling between firms has always been a misunderstanding in business. As for cracking down on hoarding, it is a normal measure, but there is no correlation between transactions between firms. If it is necessary to stabilize wheat prices, exports should be prohibited first, not the transactions between firms. They unanimously requested that the actual situation be truthfully reported to the Social Bureau for review and cancellation of the prohibition order. The Association has reported the actual situation to the Social Bureau for review.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Spot Market Somewhat Eased, Chinese Stocks Improved <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, rumors spread that the money market for Chinese stocks had eased, causing the market to open higher. After the opening, the situation fluctuated, rising and falling unpredictably. The process was cyclical, and only at 11:05 AM did it begin to improve again. Within that hour, Northern traders were actively buying, but their bids were not high, easily suppressed by sellers outside the market. After 11:00 AM, the tide turned, with Sichuan traders re-entering Xinyi and Meiya, and traders from other regions rushing to bid up prices. By 11:20 AM, all stocks were at their most profitable, with Yong Yarn surpassing the 800 yuan mark, rising to 806 yuan. Meiya reached a high of 4520 yuan before retracting. Unexpectedly, the bulls took the opportunity to close out their positions, and after 11:35 AM, the market weakened again. The supply from outside the market continued unabated, causing panic among the longs. Traders eventually engaged in large-scale selling, and the market closed at its lowest price. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Jingfu all showed small gains, Xin Guang and Qin Xing remained unchanged, Xinhe alone rose by half a percent, and Tongyi, Zhongfang, Rong, Jinglun, Zhongsheng, and Wuhe saw slight gains. Neiyi Co. and Lian saw slight declines, while Xinya, Huayi, and Cement remained unchanged. Price fluctuations for stocks outside the market were minor.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the rayon market was firm, while factory prices were weak. At 120 Tianqiao, Guangming rayon was quoted at 3.7 million yuan in the morning, and slightly better at 50,000 yuan higher in the afternoon. Other semi-gloss varieties lacked standard prices due to recent off-market transactions. The same brand of goods varied greatly in price, often differing by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Transactions have been scarce recently, as manufacturers have enough allocated goods to support them. For the time being, they do not need to search for goods in the black market. Two batches of rayon ordered from Japan by the China Trust Bureau have arrived in Shanghai, the first batch of 4,800 cases and the second batch of 6,000 cases, which the China Textile Corporation plans to sell to members of the city's silk weaving industry in batches. According to a recent survey by the industry association, there are a total of 255 member companies in the city, with a monthly demand of 2,500 cases of rayon. A detailed list has been prepared and submitted to the China Textile Corporation for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Cigarette Industry Suggests Increasing Paper Wrapper Tax Rate <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The severity of the crisis in the city's cigarette industry is evidenced by the bankruptcy of the Xin Yuan Tobacco Factory, which has over ten years of history and is the largest in scale. The industry is one of China's major industries, accounting for 49% of the city's total commodity tax revenue. Among the 82 cigarette factories in the city, there are more than 30,000 workers, with approximately 100,000 people indirectly dependent on it for their livelihoods. In addition to government loans and tax reductions, preventing the import of foreign cigarettes is also extremely important. At the same time, rampant smuggling of cigarettes on the mainland prevents the sale of local products in the interior. This is because mainland cigarette factories do not pay taxes at a 100% tax rate, and most of their raw materials are smuggled goods, resulting in lower prices. Members of the city's cigarette industry believe that if the government wants to eliminate mainland cigarette smuggling, it only needs to increase the commodity tax on paper wrappers to 100,000 yuan per ream. After purchasing the wrappers, if the factories complete the commodity tax when producing cigarettes, the tax evasion problem in the mainland can be resolved, and legitimate merchants can be protected.</p>

<p>This Tuesday, the Ramon wheel cargo ship carried 11,000 bags of white sugar from Peru in South America, planning to unload them at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. This batch of foreign sugar was shipped by the American merchant Mellon &amp;amp; Co., which holds an import license for foreign sugar from the Customs Import Management Office and is the first to import.

Raw sugar (red) was 126,000 to 128,000 yuan. Numbered goods were offered by Shantou dealers with 114,500 yuan for Tiqing, 112,500 yuan for Huanggangqing, 110,000 yuan for Bannanjing, and 113,000 to 114,000 yuan for ordinary cotton red.

<p>[Reuters Washington, 7th dispatch] The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that the 1946 world wheat harvest is approximately 5.9 billion bushels. In quantity, this is the largest since 1940. Europe had the best harvest, estimated at 1.36 billion bushels, an increase of 330 million bushels. The only exception was the British Isles, where the harvest was poor due to bad weather. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a warning: "Although Europe has a larger wheat harvest, it still needs to rely on imports."</p>

<p>According to the person in charge of China Sericulture Corporation: Regarding the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China, MacArthur expressed great enthusiasm for the restoration of China's sericulture industry and shipped a large number of Japanese silkworm seeds and mulberry seedlings to China. Later, because the domestic authorities saw a sharp decline in cocoon production after the war, and due to the reeling by various silk factories, they requested the shipment of Japanese cocoons to China in exchange for goods. MacArthur also agreed, but was later unfortunately blocked by Mr. Magana, an advisor to MacArthur's headquarters. Now MacArthur has agreed to our request to ship Japanese cocoons to China, and it is still handled by means of barter. Therefore, our silk factories will not have to worry about the interruption of raw materials in the future. As for the rumor that 500,000 bags of Japanese cocoons will be shipped to China as compensation for wartime losses, it is not true, and Mr. Shu Yunzhang, general manager of China Textile Corporation, was not commissioned to go to Japan to purchase cocoons.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Municipal Pharmaceutical Business Association stating that the announcement of the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance on September 19 has difficulties in implementation and requesting changes, has sent a letter to the bureau for consultation. The original letter stated: "We have learned that the bureau's announcement requires that any modifications to Chinese-made wine must first be submitted for approval and registration, and then verified under supervision to avoid tax evasion. In fact, the Chinese-made wines modified in this city are all transported from other ports and have tax-paid certificates, transfer certificates, and seals affixed to the containers, which are sufficient for inspection along the way, so there is no possibility of leakage. There are thousands of Chinese medicine stores in Shanghai that modify medicinal wines. Their wines are purchased in small quantities from wine merchants at any time. If each modification requires the bureau to send personnel for supervision, it is unlikely that there are enough personnel to dispatch. If it is necessary to arrange dates for each batch, the pharmacies will have to suspend production and wait, which will seriously affect business. Although the bureau has the duty to implement taxation rules, if there are indeed difficulties in implementation, for the convenience of business, it can also report the facts truthfully and request revisions. Correspondingly, we have prepared a letter to the bureau, hoping that the bureau will investigate and handle this matter."</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau has issued a circular to all schools to stop collecting the respect-for-teachers fund attached to this semester's tuition in municipal primary and secondary schools, in accordance with the resolution of the Municipal Council. According to Mr. Li Ximou, deputy director of the bureau, who met with a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, the funds that have already been collected will be managed by the Respect-for-Teachers Fund Management Committee, and those that have not yet been paid will no longer be collected in accordance with the resolution of the Municipal Council. Mr. Li also stated that the Municipal Council has approved 20% of the city's financial budget for education expenses, and the Education Bureau will do its best to work for the city's education within this budget. However, this amount is still far from the actual needs, as there are no dedicated funds for building school buildings, etc. Regarding the resolution of the Municipal Council to order all girls' schools to add courses such as obstetrics, common sense, and infant and maternity hygiene, the Education Bureau has decided to ask the Health Bureau for assistance in adding health education courses to the schools starting next semester, including teaching the above-mentioned hygiene knowledge.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper in Nanjing, 8th] During the Anti-Japanese War, middle school students from provinces and cities in the occupied areas fled. To rescue these youths who had lost their schooling, the Ministry of Education specially established many national middle schools to accommodate and educate them. After the victory, as education in the provinces and cities was restored, the Ministry of Education handed over the national middle schools to the provinces and cities to manage. Recently, the eight national middle school students remaining in the rear were separately placed in six schools in Sichuan, still under the jurisdiction of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education. The national middle schools have come to an end. However, the Ministry of Education had a Wartime Youth Recruitment Committee during the war. After the victory, the Recruitment Committee was renamed the Youth Enrollment and Employment Counseling Committee, and Minister Zhu Jiahua of the Ministry of Education continued to serve as its chairman. The committee's administrative documents were submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Education, and its expenses were independent. After the victory, the education of youths in the recovered areas still needed to be handled. The Counseling Committee specially formulated a plan to establish 21 middle schools in the recovered areas, provinces, and cities to accommodate them. The required funds were huge, and it was proposed to request the Executive Yuan to directly allocate them and have the provinces and cities manage the schools. The specific plan and budget have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and it is reported that they are still under review. If approved, middle schools will be established by the provinces and cities, and the Ministry of Education will not directly run national middle schools alone.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Qunsheng basketball team must leave Shanghai to return to the Philippines on the 14th due to shipping schedules. Therefore, they will go to Beijing today, planning to stay for two days and perform at the Lizhi Society before visiting Wuxi on the way. The trip to Suzhou was canceled due to lack of time. They will rush back to Shanghai on the 13th and return to the Philippines in two groups on the 14th, with some taking the plane and some taking the boat. The plan to have a game with the Zhenglun team can only be abandoned. The Basketball Committee urged the Tianjin Huasheng team from North China to come to Shanghai to compete with Qunsheng for the national championship. Huasheng's reply arrived yesterday, stating that they would catch a flight to Shanghai on the 15th due to the Double Ten National Day Games in North China. Unfortunately, Qunsheng could not wait any longer, and the good opportunity was missed, which is deeply regrettable. They can only wait to meet again at the National Games next year. The Basketball Committee has sent a special telegram to Tianjin Huasheng about this situation.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Ten Wins in Ten Games Are Commendable; Qunsheng Completes Glorious Record; 37 to 28 Points Defeat the Giants for the Third Time Last Night; Going to Beijing This Morning and Returning to Shanghai on the 13th and Returning to the Philippines on the 14th <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Qunsheng basketball team from the Philippines has gloriously completed its mission in Shanghai, winning all ten games and creating a perfect record. In their final game last night, in a farewell memorial, they defeated the Giants for the third time with 37 to 28 points. In the first half, Qunsheng took the lead with 16 to 14. Last night, the plan was to play against the Qinglian team of the Giant Encas, but due to the illness of Encas's general Blot, the game was changed to be played by the pure Giant team. The gymnasium was still full, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic, with about 5,000 spectators. Soldiers, police, and scouts maintained order, and the Shanghai Radio Station broadcasted live from the scene. The band from the Orphanage automatically came to the scene to play and cheer. Qunsheng is scheduled to go to Beijing by car led by Lin Zhuguang at 7:00 AM this morning, return here on the 13th, and leave Shanghai to return to the Philippines on the 14th.</p>
<p>Written Displayed Dullness</p>
<p>Before the game, Qunsheng team leader Lin Zhuguang presented a ball to the Basketball Committee as a gift, which Qian Xuchang received amid applause. Because Qunsheng had played ten consecutive games, they were inevitably tired, and with many injured players, the game was not as tight and effective as in the past, and the excitement was less than in the past. The situation displayed dullness, and the score in the first half was very close. In the first quarter, the Giants once led by six to one, but the overall situation was always under the control of Qunsheng. The Giants defended very strictly, but they were very poor at shooting, repeatedly missing shots, otherwise the situation might have changed.</p>
<p>Qunsheng Led by One Point</p>
<p>Referees Qu Honglv and Liu Hesheng blew the whistle to start the game. Cai Wenhua of Qunsheng took a short rest due to injury, and Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, Cai Wenzhang, Yang Renhui, and Zhang Yuyi took the field. The Giants started with Founick, Stevenson, Ketjemilov, Tauberlinji, and Yelong. After the start of the game, Ketjemilov opened the scoring with a long shot. Jinzhi scored a point from a free throw to pull back one point. Ketjemilov scored a second goal, and the Giants led with six to one. Jindezhang scored four points together, but Yelong and Stevenson of the Giants scored three points, making it nine to five. Qunsheng called a timeout, and Zhang Yuyi made a free throw, and Jinde stole the ball, chasing to eight to nine. Before long, the first quarter ended. In the next round, Stevenson of Qunsheng fouled, and Yang Renhui scored one point, creating a tie. Wenzhang made a wonderful shot, and Qunsheng took the lead again with eleven to nine. They then tied at twelve points twice. Yang Renhui hit a long-range shot, and Qunsheng raised their heads again. Tauberlinji broke through the middle, creating a third tie. Jinzhi broke into the basket and scored a goal. When Cai Wenhua adjusted Chen Jinde out, the first half ended appropriately, with Qunsheng leading by one point at sixteen to fourteen.</p>
<p>Giants Fell Behind from Then On</p>
<p>After the break, Qunsheng replaced Chen Jinzhi with Cai Lianke, and the Giants brought in Qiang Dulai and Sashijin to replace Yelong and Stevenson. After the Giants made a free throw by Founick, they could not raise their heads from then on. Wenzhang, Lianke, and Wenhua of Qunsheng made repeated contributions, and in the blink of an eye, they led remotely with 21 to 15 and 24 to 16. At 26 to 20, Qunsheng Chen Jinzhi replaced Cai Wenzhang, and Zhang Yuyi made a long-range shot, breaking the net. Cai Lianke scored three points with consecutive free throws and shots. The Giants were at a loss. At the end of the third quarter, the visitors led by eleven points at 31 to 20. In the last quarter, the Giants replaced Sashijin and Ketjemilov with Stevenson and Yelong. Chen Jinzhi scored first, Stevenson scored a free throw, and Yang Renhui put the ball into the basket, making the score 35 to 21. The Giants replaced Tauberlinji with Sashijin. At this time, Zhang Yuyi was disqualified for five fouls, and Chen Jinde entered the field. The Giants saw a slight turnaround, and the score was slightly closer. By the time Sashijin scored, the bell had already rung, and Qunsheng defeated the Giants with 38 to 29.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Interior has approved a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the question of "whether former non-German/Japanese nationals who subsequently acquired German/Japanese nationality due to marriage or other reasons, but after the Allied victory, have reverted to their original nationality and possess a certificate from their original country's embassy or consulate in China, are exempt from the various measures for dealing with enemy aliens." The matter has been reviewed and resolved as follows:</p>
<p>1.  If a former non-German/Japanese national in China acquired German/Japanese nationality due to marriage or other reasons, and subsequently, after the promulgation of various laws and regulations by our government regarding the handling of German/Japanese nationals, reverts to their original nationality because the marital relationship has indeed ended or for other reasons, then the aforementioned laws and regulations shall still apply to those nationals.</p>
<p>2.  If a former non-German/Japanese national in China acquired German/Japanese nationality due to marriage or other reasons, but retains their original nationality according to the nationality laws of their home country, our government will still recognize that such nationals possess their original nationality. If these nationals engaged in acts endangering China in occupied areas or other regions, they shall still be dealt with in accordance with our laws.</p>
<p>The above two points have been approved by the Ministry of Interior with the consent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Municipal Government has been instructed to take note.</p>

<h3 id="e168">The Light Trotting of Hooves on Bluestone Slabs: The Weary Journey on the Xuzhou-Huaiyin Road <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Report from Huaiyin, 2nd, Our Special Correspondent, Hang Zhou</p>
<p>The recovery of Huaiyin, the "Yan'an of Northern Jiangsu," is a significant event. Militarily, the situation in Northern Jiangsu is expected to clear up soon. Politically, it nakedly exposes the true nature of the Communist Party's "liberated areas."</p>
<p>On September 28th, the reporter traveled from Xuzhou to Huaiyin. The Xuzhou-Huaiyin highway can arguably be described as the worst road. As the Communist army retreated section by section, they destroyed the road section by section. They are indeed experts in destroying roads, and the road was destroyed so thoroughly. The National Army mobilized a large number of laborers to repair it, but even now, the road is still like waves in the sea. A six-wheeled army truck, weighing five tons itself and reaching a total weight of nine tons, moved forward like a drunkard, swaying and staggering. Everyone inside the truck was dizzy from the bumping.</p>
<p>Like Emerging from a Coal Mine</p>
<p>The north is the world of wind and sand. More than a dozen large trucks drove in succession, and those behind seemed to be driving in a cloud of dust. We arrived in Suqian late in the evening, and after getting out of the car, everyone looked as if they had emerged from a coal mine.</p>
<p>There was no place to stay in Suqian. Most of the houses had been destroyed, and the few that remained were occupied by soldiers. I had no choice but to stay at the county government. County Magistrate Dong Jianhua received me with a half-sick body. He told me that since returning to his hometown, both the secretary-general of the county party committee and the secretary of the county youth league had fallen ill, and he hoped that he could keep going.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, I took a car to Siyang again. The closer we got to the front, the harder the road became. In Yanghe Town, famous for its "Yanghe Da Mian" (wheat noodles), there was a bridge that could not bear heavy loads. The supplies had to be unloaded, the empty truck driven across, and then reloaded. This up-and-down process took two hours. This was not economical, and there was always the possibility of being attacked by the Communist army. The troops at the front found the inflexibility of transportation the most troublesome thing.</p>
<p>Arsonist Xue Weixian</p>
<p>We stopped in Siyang for another night. The large trucks could only go this far. Further ahead, the old Yellow River Bridge and the Grand Canal Bridge were obstacles. The Communist army set fire to these two bridges when they left. The arsonist was Xue Weixian, the chairman of a civilian association. I saw him in the Siyang County government prison. He admitted that he did it, but as usual, he claimed that he was forced to. The damage to the two bridges is simply impossible to quantify. Currently, engineers and laborers are concentrated on repairing them, and they should be officially open to traffic on October 3rd. If it were not for the destruction of the bridges, which prevented supplies from reaching the front, the National Army would not have temporarily halted its advance after reaching Huaiyin and Huai'an, giving the Communist army a chance to catch their breath.</p>
<p>The extent of the damage in Siyang is the most severe of the counties recently recovered by the National Army. The city is almost gone. The new city, Zhongxing Town, is on the opposite bank of the river and is also in ruins. There are very few residents. According to statistics, there are only 8,200 people in the urban area. All commerce has ceased. There are only a few vendors selling cigarettes and pancakes. I came from the prosperous areas of Jiangnan, and it was like going back a century. I was truly overwhelmed with emotion.</p>
<p>Riding Straight to Matou Town</p>
<p>With the main road impassable, the only way to go to Huaiyin was by a small road. It was originally a oxcart path, but the surface had been widened due to military transportation. Jeeps could pass from Siyang to Nanxinjie. He Zhenming, the branch supervisor of the 12th Logistic Station of the Joint Service Headquarters, happened to be going to inspect the area, so I hopped in his jeep and went.</p>
<p>It was only 35 li, and we arrived in an hour and a half. The headquarters of the 28th Reorganized Division was stationed here. The adjutant's office sent a horse to take me to Huaiyin. It was another 60 li from here.</p>
<p>After lunch, I set off at 2:00 PM. The horse was a Japanese horse, quite tall, but it walked very slowly. The groom wanted me to whip it hard, but I was a little worried, fearing that it would get excited and run so fast that I couldn't hold the reins. So, we proceeded at a speed of 10 li per hour. Near Matou Town, we needed to cross two rivers. The ferry was small, and the water was deep, so we couldn't cross. I asked the horse to return. I walked to Matou Town. Looking at my watch, it was already 6:00 PM. It was still 20 li to Huaiyin, and my legs were sore from using too much energy, so I couldn't walk fast. But I was determined to get to Huaiyin. I inquired in Matou Town and learned that the 192nd Brigade of the 28th Division was stationed here. I visited Brigade Commander Zeng Zhen. In addition to sending a horse to take me, he also sent four soldiers with guns.</p>
<p>Weary Journey of Three Full Days</p>
<p>Before long, it got dark. The night was when the Communist army was active, and the suburbs of Huaiyin were not very peaceful. But I came to visit it. The sound of hooves echoed on the bluestone slabs. I arrived at the north gate of Huaiyin. My excitement banished my fear.</p>
<p>Huaiyin City was under martial law. After 8:00 PM, traffic was prohibited. It was already 8:30 PM. After some negotiation, I was finally allowed into the city. The martial law was indeed extremely strict. When I first arrived in Huaiyin, I saw how thoroughly the officers and soldiers of the 74th Reorganized Division, which had recovered Huaiyin, carried out their orders. From the north gate to the adjutant's office of the division headquarters, I went through more than a dozen checkpoints, which took two hours.</p>
<p>It took me three days to get from Xuzhou to Huaiyin, which I was told was the fastest possible. County Magistrate Huang Jiaju walked to his post, which took him even longer. Huaiyin was once a place shrouded in mystery, and now, I will uncover this secret for you.</p>

<h3 id="e169">On the Strength and Improvement of Overseas Chinese Commerce (Part 2) <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Bincun</p>
<p>(4) The Strength of Overseas Chinese Commerce in Burma</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Burma are geographically divided into two parts: Upper Burma and Lower Burma. The former, due to its proximity to Yunnan, has land routes. They engage in civil engineering and the gemstone industry. Therefore, most immigrants are from Yunnan. The latter comes via sea routes, so most immigrants are from Fujian and Guangdong, residing along the Irrawaddy River and the coast, with Rangoon as the center. People from Yunnan account for about 32%, Fujian 28%, Guangdong 21%, and other unspecified overseas Chinese 19%. There are more than 350,000 overseas Chinese in Burma with citizenship that can be relinquished, and about one million mixed-race Burmese without citizenship, totaling more than 1.3 million, accounting for more than one-tenth of the total population of Burma. The international trade of Burma and the commercial situation of overseas Chinese are analyzed as follows:</p>

<p>Now, let’s explore the trade situation between Burma and the international community, and China. Regarding its relations with the international community, we can express it with the following numbers:</p>
<p>(1) Burma's Trade with the International Community</p>
<p>Table of Burma's Foreign Trade and Percentage Distribution from 1939 to 1940 (Unit: Thousand Rupees)</p>
<p>Looking at the previous table, it can be seen that in Burma's trade with the international community, India ranks first, the United Kingdom and its colonies rank second, Japan ranks third, the United States and Africa rank fourth, and Europe and other countries rank fifth.</p>
<p>(2) Burma's Trade with China</p>
<p>As for Burma's foreign trade with China, it was first recorded in our customs registers in 1868, with a value of 23.4 million customs taels that year. This record was not broken until 1900. From 1901 to 1930, there was gradual progress, reaching 199.912 million yuan. From 1933 to 1934, due to the global economic depression, trade declined. Sino-Burmese trade was incorporated into Indian statistics in 1934, and only later became independent.</p>
<p>The following is a table of Burma's trade statistics with China from 1936 to 1940:</p>
<p>Statistics of Burma's Exports to China and Percentage of China's Total Foreign Trade Value (Unit: Thousand National Currency)</p>
<p>According to the table on the right, it should be known that Burma's trade with China has always had exports exceeding imports. Although there has been a tendency for import surplus since 1940, much of it is due to goods imported from China and transshipped to other countries via Burma. Moreover, in the 78 years, Burma's trade position with China has always been less than 1% of China's total import and export volume. However, this refers to maritime trade. Land trade has not been included in the customs register, making it difficult to accurately estimate. During the war, China's seaports were blockaded. Following the international sister road of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Burma Road became important. According to investigations, from 1939 to 1940, the value of goods transported from Burma to China via land was 19.5 million rupees.</p>
<p>In summary, we can get a correct understanding: that many raw materials needed by countries such as Britain, the United States, China, and the Netherlands must be supplied by Burma; conversely, many of the manufactured goods produced also need to find considerable outlets in Burma. Moreover, Japan ranked second in Burma's trade. After the invasion and occupation, it built the Burma-Thailand Railway and forcibly implemented cotton planting plans in Burma, producing 17,900 tons annually from 1942 to 1943, and 16,000 square yards of cotton cloth. Therefore, the earliest recovery of Burma in the Pacific War: (1) From the perspective of our Allied countries, China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, the recovery of Burma enables each other's economies to complement each other's strengths. (2) Furthermore, from the perspective of inflicting a major blow on Japan through economic warfare, the recovery of Burma eliminates its long-term exploitation of Burma's resources for its own survival, thereby leading to its early collapse and surrender. Burma's relationship with international economy, whether in peacetime or wartime, is of such importance.</p>
<p>2.  Commerce of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>As for the employment situation of Burmese and overseas Chinese, the former's agricultural population accounts for less than one-third of the total population. More are engaged in primary industries, with a total of 12,422,074 people employed. The latter mainly engages in commerce and industry, with commerce being twice as prevalent as industry. The most common businesses operated are general merchandise stores. The next most common are rice and grain and local produce businesses. These are explained separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Rice Industry: The power is in the hands of Europeans, but inland transportation is mostly operated by overseas Chinese, especially those from Fujian. There are about 100 rice mills owned by overseas Chinese in Burma, and hundreds of grain trading firms. Overseas Chinese engaged in the rice business mostly obtain profits through lending and acting as intermediaries.</p>
<p>(2) Local Produce Industry: Commonly known as coarse goods merchants, overseas Chinese, in addition to focusing on soybean exports, also include selling betel nuts, tobacco, bananas, cowhide, black tea, etc. imported from India. Most of those engaged in this business are from Fujian, followed by Yunnan, and then Guangdong. The footprints of these merchants can be found in large and small cities. Among them, betel nut is a daily necessity for local people and has a very wide market. However, due to insufficient capital or lack of understanding of market conditions, overseas Chinese merchants cannot directly handle the goods, so the market is often seized by Indian merchants. Cowhide is transshipped to Europe and America, with substantial profits.</p>
<p>(3) General Merchandise Merchants: They deal in selling daily necessities. Indian merchants are the most powerful in this category, followed by overseas Chinese. However, the universality of Chinese merchants far exceeds that of Indian merchants. The items sold include daily necessities such as oil, salt, sugar, garlic, chili, beans, and seafood, as well as domestic goods such as tea, firecrackers, lychees, candles, and tooth powder.</p>
<p>(4) Foreign Goods Stores: They sell piece goods, decorations, appliances, and Chinese and Western stationery.</p>
<p>(5) Timber Merchants: These merchants mostly purchase large quantities of forests from local people or contract for logging, and then resell them to factories.</p>
<p>(6) Pharmacies: They specialize in selling Chinese and Western medicines, medical supplies, etc. Most of these commodities in Burma are operated by overseas Chinese and Indians. Locals who operate this business are as rare as phoenix feathers. However, compared with Indians, overseas Chinese account for a larger proportion.</p>
<p>(7) Ironware Merchants: There are about 100 households in total. Because European goods are expensive, they are quite popular.</p>
<p>(8) Remittance Business: Generally known as "Piye" in South India. They specialize in handling remittances for overseas Chinese. Although post offices and banks have been actively involved recently, these merchants can obtain replies for remitters, so overseas Chinese trust them quite a bit.</p>
<p>(9) There are also other non-purely commercial businesses: such as (1) Convenience Stores - with sweet flavors and snacks, such as coffee, cocoa, sweet tea, pastries, etc., and salty flavors and snacks, such as noodles, rice, and dishes; (2) Workshops - with photography, dentistry, sewing, barbering, shoemaking, and repair of machinery; (3) Specialty Stores - managing local government monopolies on tobacco, alcohol, opium, kerosene, and contracting pawnshops. Slaughter tax and other taxes. Among these three types of businesses, except for (1) and a part of (2), which are operated by Chinese, Indian, and Burmese people, the rest are almost exclusively occupied by overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Among the above nine categories, in terms of the proportion operated by overseas Chinese themselves, the former category (1) accounts for 11%, (2) accounts for 20%, (3) accounts for 17%, (4) accounts for 16%, (5) accounts for about 6%, (6) accounts for 5%, (7) accounts for 4%, (8) accounts for 3%, and (9) accounts for 15%.</p>
<p>(5) The Strength of Overseas Chinese Commerce in Malaya</p>
<p>There are 2.4 million overseas Chinese in Malaya, with those from Fujian ranking first, accounting for about 53%, followed by Guangdong, accounting for about 41%, and other overseas Chinese from various provinces accounting for about 6%. Singapore in Malaya, geographically located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, has become the largest port in Southeast Asia and is used by various countries as a distribution center for goods. Singapore is not only the economic center of overseas Chinese but also the place where overseas Chinese in Southeast Asian countries promote culture and education, and even launch activities such as saving the country and disaster relief. The leaders of overseas Chinese in Singapore always lead. Singapore also ranks third among the seven major commercial ports in Asia. The importance of overseas Chinese commerce in Malaya is self-evident. According to the 1931 population census report of Malaya, there were 940,972 employed overseas Chinese, accounting for 55% of the total population, of which 146,882 were engaged in commerce and finance, accounting for 85% of the total overseas Chinese population in Malaya, or 15.6% of the employed population. According to a survey by the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in 1938, there were 110 types of commercial activities engaged by overseas Chinese in the Singapore area, with 6,750 shops. The following analysis focuses on the two aspects of the types of stores operated by overseas Chinese in Singapore and their position among rubber merchants, reflecting a glimpse of the commercial activities of overseas Chinese in Singapore and Malaya.</p>
<p>1.  Categories of Overseas Chinese Shops in Singapore</p>
<p>Among the 6,765 shops owned by overseas Chinese in Singapore, the following five categories are the most numerous among the 110 types of businesses:</p>
<p>Among the five categories, general merchandise merchants rank first, followed by coffee merchants, and then agents. This is sufficient to prove that there are many shops owned by overseas Chinese, but they are mostly intermediaries. In terms of businesses, rubber, number nine-eight guild, rice, automobiles, porcelain, and cordage are mostly operated by people from Fujian. General merchandise is mostly handled by people from Guangzhou and Jiaying, fabrics are mostly handled by people from Chaozhou, coffee is mostly handled by \[unclear], pawnshops are mostly handled by Hakka from Dabu, leather shoes are mostly handled by people from Jiaying, Western medicine is half from Fujian, and Chinese medicine is mostly handled by Hakka from Guangzhou.</p>
<p>2.  The Position of Overseas Chinese and Foreign Rubber Merchants in Singapore</p>
<p>There are 228 rubber merchants in Singapore, and 177 of them are owned by overseas Chinese, which is more than any single country such as Britain, Japan, the United States, or the Netherlands. The comparison is listed below:</p>
<p>Although the number of rubber shops owned by overseas Chinese is more than the total number of shops owned by Britain, Japan, the United States, and the Netherlands combined, like other shops, overseas Chinese rubber merchants are also mostly intermediaries, and their capital scale is difficult to match that of foreign merchants.</p>
<p>6.  The Strength of Overseas Chinese Commerce in the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>There are 1.4 million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, most of whom are engaged in commerce. They occupy an intermediate position in commerce, purchasing goods from "Tokos" (warehouses) of large Western and Eastern ocean liners and reselling them to local people. At the same time, they purchase local products from local people and resell them to European, American, and Japanese exporting "Tokos," making a profit of one percent. Few directly operate importing and exporting "Tokos." Most are small and medium-sized merchants, especially retailers. Not only are there overseas Chinese retail merchants in large cities, but even in remote areas, as long as there are people living, there are their traces. The pervasiveness of their strength is unparalleled. Therefore, the investments and income of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are divided into two points as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Investments of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>(1) Comparison of Investments by Overseas Chinese and Foreigners</p>
<p>According to a survey by Helfferich in 1921, among the investments in the Dutch East Indies, the Netherlands accounted for 73%, ranking first, overseas Chinese accounted for 10%, ranking second, Britain accounted for 9%, ranking third, and Japan accounted for 1%. Although this may seem outdated from today's perspective, it can still reflect the situation at that time and the foundation of overseas Chinese investment.</p>
<p>(2) Commercial Investments of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The previous survey by Helfferich on overseas Chinese investment may have been incomplete due to the lack of inspections on that day, or because overseas Chinese investment has increased with the evolution of the times. Therefore, his statistics can only serve as a preliminary basis for overseas Chinese investment in the Dutch East Indies and cannot be regarded as a definitive conclusion. Recent surveys of overseas Chinese investments in various commercial sectors show that, in terms of invested capital, there are 1,500 overseas Chinese local product merchants with capital of more than 100,000 guilders, 600 fabric merchants with capital of more than 50,000 guilders, 1,250 general merchandise merchants with capital of more than 50,000 guilders, 50 other ordinary merchants with capital of more than 10,000 guilders, and 8 merchants with capital of more than 1,000 guilders. Statistics show that the commercial wealth of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies is around 792.5 million guilders. As for the regional origins of overseas Chinese active in various commercial sectors in the Dutch East Indies, generally speaking, those from Fujian mostly deal in local products, and those from Guangdong mostly deal in general merchandise. Further analysis shows that people from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou mostly deal in local products, fish, rice, and fabrics, rubber factories, and oil mills. Hakka mostly deal in general merchandise, wine and cheese, shoe stores, jewelry, and sewing. People from Changting mostly deal in medicinal materials. People from Guangdong mostly deal in hotels, restaurants, photography, civil engineering, and machinery factories. People from Chaozhou mostly engage in agriculture and vegetable gardens.</p>
<p>2.  Assets and Income of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>According to the report of the Dutch East Indies Central Bureau of Statistics: In 1937, there were a total of 3,079 overseas Chinese with assets ranging from 25,000 guilders to 1 million guilders, with a total asset value of 242 million guilders. In 1938, it decreased to 2,684 people, and the total assets also decreased to 220 million guilders. The average monthly income of ordinary overseas Chinese ranges from 40 guilders to 150 guilders. Furthermore, according to the 1938 report of the Dutch East Indies Central Bureau of Statistics, the annual income and number of overseas Chinese are as follows: Unit: (Guilders)</p>
<p>Annual Income Number of People</p>
<p>900——1,000 3,631</p>
<p>1,000——1,200 5,811</p>
<p>1,200——1,500 8,262</p>
<p>1,500——2,000 8,627</p>
<p>2,000——2,500 5,095</p>
<p>2,500——3,000 3,008</p>
<p>3,000——4,000 3,738</p>
<p>4,000——5,000 1,900</p>
<p>5,000——6,000 1,097</p>
<p>6,000——8,000 1,209</p>
<p>8,000——10,000 544</p>
<p>10,000——12,000 318</p>
<p>12,000——15,000 270</p>
<p>15,000——20,000 196</p>
<p>20,000——25,000 85</p>
<p>25,000——30,000 85</p>
<p>30,000——40,000 55</p>
<p>40,000——50,000 18</p>
<p>50,000——60,000 12</p>
<p>60,000——80,000 15</p>
<p>80,000——100,000 3</p>
<p>100,000——120,000 2</p>
<p>120,000 and Above 1</p>
<p>Total 3,955,000,000</p>
<p>The previous table only lists the annual income of overseas Chinese above the middle class; the income of those below the middle class is not included. It is estimated that the total income of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies is at least 5 billion guilders.</p>
<p>More than half of the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are engaged in commerce. Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the first Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, said: "The overseas Chinese are the most hardworking and an indispensable ethnic group in our cities." W.J. Katon, commenting on the economic status of overseas Chinese, said: "Due to the diligence, frugality, and business acumen of overseas Chinese, they are not only beneficial to the future Dutch East Indies society but also an indispensable element." In peacetime, the overseas Chinese have made contributions to the construction of cities and the development of mountains and fields in the Dutch East Indies. During World War II, the overseas Chinese assisted the Dutch Allied forces and local people in jointly resisting the Japanese army. After the Allied victory and the defeat of Japan, the Sino-Dutch Equal Treaty was signed in London on May 29 last year, and the ratified copies were formally exchanged in Chongqing on December 5 of the same year. It is hoped that the Dutch East Indies government and local people will understand that the overseas Chinese are hardworking, frugal, easy to get along with, and worthy of being treated differently. Do not oppress the overseas Chinese at every turn, and give each other "the right for the people of the other contracting party to enter and exit its territory, as well as to travel, reside, and engage in commerce throughout the territory," so that overseas Chinese can live and work in peace, and the economic relations between the two countries will be even closer and more advanced.</p>
<p>3.  Principles for Improving Overseas Chinese Commerce</p>
<p>From the above, it should be possible to get a glimpse of the strengths of overseas Chinese, which are their diligence and frugality, making their commercial power solid and invincible. On the downside, it is obvious that overseas Chinese commerce only occupies an intermediate position, lacking the tight organization and scientific management of modern large enterprises. They rely on individual self-reliance, hard work, and perseverance, but lack the spirit of pooling ideas, collective efforts, and cooperation. Matters such as national protection and financial accommodation are considered inadequate. Therefore, although there are many overseas Chinese and their business talents are outstanding, they can only be intermediate merchants and cannot become large merchants with uniqueness and control over the commercial arena. When engaging in commerce, one should engage in large-scale businesses and enterprises, not small businesses. Merchants should be large merchants who occupy important positions in the commercial arena, not small merchants who haggle over every penny. In the future, to promote the strengths of overseas Chinese, address the shortcomings of overseas Chinese, and improve overseas Chinese commerce, the following three principles should be followed:</p>
<p>1.  National Aspect</p>
<p>(1) There should be dedicated institutions and capable personnel to guide overseas Chinese investment.</p>
<p>(2) Protect national capital and adopt conservation policies.</p>
<p>(3) Improve the equal legal status of overseas Chinese in their places of residence and promote the participation of overseas Chinese in local political activities.</p>
<p>(4) Enhance China's international status, improve China's foreign economic relations, and strive for equal opportunities for overseas Chinese in the economic development of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>(5) The state should provide loans to assist those returning overseas, especially those returning to Southeast Asia, to develop economic enterprises abroad.</p>
<p>2.  Overseas Chinese Aspect</p>
<p>(1) Promote joint ventures and cooperation among overseas Chinese businesses: (1) In terms of nature - reduce retailers and switch to production enterprises. (2) Concentration principle - concentrate scattered capital into capital for production enterprises. (3) Utilization method - use idle capital to concentrate on production. (4) Cooperation method - promote talent and technical cooperation.</p>
<p>(2) Improve business methods: (1) Change from sole proprietorship or small partnership to modern enterprise organization. (2) Establish overseas Chinese financial circulation institutions. (3) Directly handle international trade and improve the status of overseas Chinese intermediaries. (4) Recognize the weaknesses of foreign economic enterprises, strive to develop our strengths, and get along well with local people with a good attitude of national diplomacy to enhance mutual feelings.</p>
<p>3.  Coordination and Connection</p>
<p>(1) Overseas Chinese invest in shipping to assist the government in developing foreign transportation enterprises.</p>
<p>(2) Utilize the rich resources of China and foreign countries to make up for the lack of domestic resources.</p>
<p>(3) Promote the sale of Chinese-made finished products and materials abroad.</p>
<p>(4) After China's industrialization, transfer the surplus population to Southeast Asia to develop overseas Chinese economic enterprises.</p>
<p>(5) Under the condition that foreign economic enterprises do not harm their development, invest their surplus capital domestically to develop production and construction enterprises in the motherland.</p>
<p>(6) Seek cooperation and coordination of domestic and foreign talents and technologies.</p>
<p>(7) Develop cooperative business operations between the government and merchants through mutual assistance and cooperation in capital.</p>
<p>(8) The state and overseas Chinese should assist each other in developing international trade.</p>
<p>In short, in order to promote the economy and commerce of overseas Chinese in the future, one must consider the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The development of Southeast Asian economic enterprises after the war should abandon the laissez-faire doctrine of the past and closely cooperate with domestic economic construction.</p>
<p>(2) The individualistic free competition method in overseas Chinese economic enterprises should be greatly improved in order to achieve the purpose of protecting overseas Chinese businesses.</p>
<p>(3) The government should strive for equal treatment for overseas Chinese through diplomatic channels.</p>
<p>(4) The government should provide technical talents and give overseas Chinese appropriate guidance.</p>
<p>(5) Overseas Chinese economic enterprises, which have been destroyed and plundered by the enemy during the war, should be assisted by the government with practical and swift methods through loans to help them recover, revive, and develop after the war, depending on the actual needs. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e170">Economic Merger of the British and American Zones in Germany to Counter Soviet Expansion; British and American Expenditures Exceed 400 Million Yuan Annually <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by our editorial department from U.S. News &amp; World Report — Xi</p>
<p>The British and American occupation zones in Germany are now preparing for an economic merger. The current cost to the British and American governments for Germany is approximately two billion yuan annually. After the two zones merge, the burden on British and American taxpayers can be reduced by thirty percent. However, even after the merger, Germany will not be self-sufficient for several years.</p>
<p>The real purpose of the merger is actually political, nothing more than to let the Soviet Union know that abolishing all boundaries and economically integrating Germany is beneficial to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union can isolate itself from the Western occupation zones and await an opportunity, hoping that the burden Germany places on the British and Americans will cause them to become impatient or even withdraw from Germany, in which case all of Germany will fall into the hands of the Communists and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has no difficulty waiting for an opportunity. Among the four occupation zones, only the Soviet zone has a surplus of food, exceeding 2,654,000 tons in 1939. What the Soviet Union fears is that, regardless of the cost, the British and Americans will proceed with their planned development of Germany into a non-communist country with an economic power greater than the Soviet occupation zone.</p>
<p>American occupation zone official Clay expressed his opinion on the merger of the British and American occupation zones, saying, "The main reason for the merger is necessity. The American occupation zone is not economically self-sufficient, but it contributes greatly to other occupation zones. After the merger of the British and American zones, Germans can have the opportunity to earn a living for the first time since the end of the war."</p>
<p>Since Germany was divided into four parts, it has completely lost its economic function. This economic paralysis has increased the heavy burden on British and American taxpayers. The purpose of the merger is to alleviate this unhealthy state.</p>
<p>The annual cost to Britain and the United States for providing supplies and managing their respective occupation zones is 200 million yuan for the United States and 220 million yuan for Britain, in addition to occupation expenses. Until suspicion among the great powers is eliminated, and until Germany can achieve economic self-sufficiency under the supervision of the powers, British and American troops cannot be reduced to the minimum number as planned.</p>
<p>According to British estimates, the total annual salary of the 350,000 British troops stationed in Germany is 430 million yuan, excluding food and other maintenance costs. British soldiers' salaries are far less generous than those of American soldiers. The average annual salary of a British soldier is about 2,700 yuan, while that of an American soldier is about 6,000 yuan. The annual cost of maintaining 315,000 people in the American occupation zone has not been accurately estimated, but even if the total cost per person is reduced to 3,000 yuan, the total would be around one billion yuan.</p>
<p>In addition to these staggering figures (more than two billion yuan combined for Britain and the United States), there are countless losses suffered by Britain and the United States due to the economic disorder in other parts of Europe caused by the unresolved German problem. If a divided Germany did not burden Europe, then the billions of dollars spent on relief work and loans could be greatly saved.</p>
<p>It is expected that within six months after the implementation of the merger of the British and American zones, the dependence on external sources of materials can be gradually reduced. Several benefits are already available. Britain can supply ample bituminous coal and coke, gravel, phosphate fertilizers, pig iron, semi-finished iron, finished steel, construction steel, and railway materials.</p>
<p>The American occupation zone is politically more advanced than the British occupation zone. Germans under American supervision hold real power, while Germans in the British zone are only advisors. To align with this situation, Britain will grant German officials greater power.</p>
<p>The joint development of economic resources in the two occupation zones can enhance strength to resist inflation. If the Soviet Union firmly opposes restoring Germany's productivity, then this new strength must be used.</p>
<p>The financial plan drafted by three American experts is being promoted by Clay. The plan advocates that the unavoidable war expenses and the price of defeat be shared equally by the German people. The new currency, capital tax, and property tax in the plan will apply to all of Germany. If the Soviet Union rejects this plan, Britain and the United States will establish a financial system independently in the merged area.</p>
<p>After the merger of the two zones, a standard rationing system will be implemented. Initially, it is planned to reduce the ration of the ten million Germans in the American occupation zone to be equal to the ration of the Germans in the British zone. However, with a good harvest expected, the ration in the British zone may be increased to be equal to the ration in the American zone.</p>
<p>The harvest of sweet potatoes in the British zone this year may reach nine million tons, almost double the more than five million tons last year. The harvest in the American zone has also increased. If the food ration for miners in the Ruhr area can be increased, then assuming there are 360,000 miners, daily production can reach 300,000 tons.</p>
<p>The merger of the British and American occupation zones indicates that the Soviet Union and France must choose between "competition" and "partnership." In fact, economic merger and agricultural improvement can reduce the annual burden on British and American taxpayers by thirty percent. This is a considerable saving. However, experts admit that the merger of the British and American occupation zones is only an expedient measure. Its purpose is to encourage France and the Soviet Union to cooperate and work towards the economic unification of all of Germany, so that all the powers can benefit.</p>
<h3 id="e171">The World Situation: Relaxed Externally, Tense Internally <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>Verbal Peace, But Vigilance Unrelaxed</p>
<p>Since Stalin's call for peace, the world, filled with talk of war, has suddenly had a chance to clear up. Although the American press was very indifferent to Stalin's speech, Eisenhower, who had just arrived in Berlin, was the first to express his belief that the Soviet Union could cooperate with Britain and the United States. Former Secretary of State Hull, old and respected, also called for peace among the powers from his deathbed. At the same time, US Secretary of State Byrnes spoke in Paris in response to Stalin's speech, also expressing disbelief that "a new war" was about to break out, and changing the 25-year treaty to a 40-year treaty for the disarmament of Germany. President Truman also expressed his support for Byrnes' policy in Washington, believing that the international situation could be eased as a result; however, the result of the Paris Peace Conference not only did not eliminate the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but instead made the rift deeper than before. Therefore, the world's attention has once again focused on the rumors of a meeting of the Big Three.</p>
<p>Therefore, the world situation this week is relaxed externally and tense internally. Whether the pleasing peace calls will have a real effect on the creation of world peace depends on the actual actions of all countries.</p>
<p>British and American Vigilance Increasing</p>
<p>The continued presence of the US Navy in the Mediterranean has caused unease among various countries; everyone is eagerly awaiting the decision of the US authorities. Navy Secretary Forrestal issued a statement stating that the US Navy's continued presence in the Mediterranean has two main purposes: (1) to supply the military needs of the Allied occupation forces in the European occupation zones and to assist the Allied military governments in fulfilling their occupation tasks; (2) to protect American interests and support American policies. At the same time, President Truman also explained to reporters the US policy on existing bases in the Pacific: (1) to maintain Guam and Saipan as the center of American defense in the Western Pacific; (2) to establish secondary bases in Okinawa, Truk, and other islands; (3) to also establish bases in the Philippines; (4) a solid base is currently being established on Kodiak Island near Alaska for the use of the US Navy. Subsequently, US Secretary of the Army Patterson stated more directly that the United States should maintain a strong military, with a standing army of 70 army divisions and 27 air force groups, whose tasks are two: (1) to occupy the territories of enemy countries in Europe and the Pacific to ensure the victory of the Allies; (2) in the event of any attempt to attack the United States, the standing army should immediately retaliate.</p>
<p>In addition, US aviator Colonel Irvine flew the Superfortress "Dream Boat" directly from Honolulu to Cairo, and the test was successful, which will have an extraordinary and significant contribution to American defense.</p>
<p>British Cabinet Reshuffle: Unified Military</p>
<p>Rumors of a British cabinet reshuffle have been circulating for a long time, and it was finally announced on the 4th. The most noteworthy feature of this reshuffle is twofold. First, the British cabinet added a Ministry of Defense to unify the British military structure, with Secretary of the Navy Alexander appointed as minister, which is a major innovation for British national defense. This move by Britain has been rumored for a long time. Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery visited Washington earlier this month to inspect the US military organization, and stated that Britain would also reorganize its military organization according to the US system to facilitate future military cooperation between Britain and the United States. Therefore, the British cabinet's addition of a Ministry of Defense is actually a preparatory work to deal with "future wars." Second, the British cabinet reshuffle this time employed several young and promising rising stars, and the promotion of Undersecretary McNeil to Secretary of State was particularly welcomed by all parties. Today's Labor cabinet is the most vibrant cabinet in the world. However, most of the veteran members of the Labor Party remain in the cabinet, so there will not be any changes in the general policy direction, and the focus remains on state-owned policies to improve the national economic life. However, the Conservative Party Congress is being held in Blackpool, England, and Churchill believes that the opportunity is rare, so he gave a speech, fiercely criticizing the Labor government, saying that the Labor Party is willing to undermine national unity for the political interests of its party and has failed to maintain the position that Britain should occupy in the international arena. This kind of argument can often resonate with a part of the British people, but the Labor Party is in a tight spot, and the road is getting narrower and narrower. It really needs to find a way out of the depression.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Strengthening Western Hemisphere Defense to Cope with New Aggression in the Future; US-Argentine Relations Have Improved <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Report from "World Weekly" Argentina Correspondent — Nan</p>
<p>The political discord between Argentina and the United States has lasted for almost five years, but recently the relationship between the two countries has clearly been undergoing a transformation. As a result of repeated meetings between Argentine President Perón and US Ambassador to Argentina Messersmith, almost all major differences have been resolved, and the stage of issuing public statements has been reached.</p>
<p>Once the agreement between the two countries is announced, they can proceed to discuss the plans for the Inter-American Defense and US training and partial equipment of the Argentine Armed Forces.</p>
<p>"World Weekly" Buenos Aires correspondent Raymond reported that diplomatic circles in the Argentine capital all believe that concerns about communism are an important factor in promoting harmony between the two countries.</p>
<p>Everyone remembers that in June of this year, Perón gave special preferential treatment to the Soviet Union's commercial delegation. At that time, Soviet newspapers publicized the improvement of Soviet-Argentine relations, but now he is paying special attention to Messersmith. The diplomatic community finds this change to be quite meaningful.</p>
<p>Three Difficulties Approaching Resolution</p>
<p>In fact, several difficult issues between the United States and Argentina are approaching resolution: (1) The control of industrial and commercial enterprises previously owned by Germans is being intensified. (2) The closure of German schools will soon be announced. (3) The work of deporting many Germans has been completed, including the crew of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee."</p>
<p>However, there are still two points that make the United States feel dissatisfied: (1) Argentina has been slow to ratify the Inter-American agreements of Chapultepec and Mexico City. Although Perón said after being elected president that the Argentine Congress must pass them, no action has been taken to date, which baffles US officials. (2) The existence of German potential power is also a concern for the United States. One of the most puzzling points for the United States is that German tycoon Fluhr, whom the US considers to be a Nazi but Perón considers to be a close friend, claims to have obtained Argentine citizenship. The United States advocates that the nationality of people like Fluhr should be revoked and they should be expelled from the country. But no decision has been made to date.</p>
<p>However, the United States and Argentina will not fail to reach an agreement because of this, because other countries in the Americas hope to restore past friendly relations.</p>
<p>Convening a Military Conference After the Agreement is Concluded</p>
<p>The first part of the agreement will be largely military in nature. It is expected that Argentina will ask the United States to send a military delegation, just like the US military delegations sent to other Latin American countries to engage in military training. Therefore, US military regulations and training methods can replace the German military regulations and training methods currently used in the country. There are already US naval advisors and air force delegations in Argentina.</p>
<p>In addition, the United States can supply a limited number of weapons and equipment to replace the outdated equipment obtained from Europe. Officers of the Argentine army, navy, and air force can go to US military academies to study, just like officers from other Latin American countries.</p>
<p>After the agreement is concluded, it can also enable the Inter-American Conference to be convened earlier in the capital of Brazil to jointly discuss the defense of the Western Hemisphere to prevent aggression. The Brazilian government hopes that this meeting, which has been repeatedly postponed due to the discord between the United States and Argentina, can be convened in November.</p>
<p>Argentina used to be a traitor to the Inter-American Conference. The diplomatic community expects that this meeting in the capital of Brazil can test how far Argentina can cooperate with other countries in the Americas.</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Art of Making a Living in France: My Fellow Chinese Suffer through the Years <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Song Yu</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's Paris, September 26th dispatch] Chinese people who have been to Paris have probably also been to a small Zhejiang noodle shop near the Lyon station to eat wontons or fried noodles. This noodle shop is very small, the decoration is not outstanding, and there is no sign in front of the door, so it is difficult for strangers to find. It is expected that business will be slow. It is only because the wontons and fried noodles it makes are completely authentic Chinese style, so the compatriots in Paris are always willing to invite you to experience this taste of home. There are five or six such small restaurants in this small alley. The business is equally sluggish, and they are all heading towards a declining fate. Except for a few compatriots living nearby as regular customers, few French people patronize them. But if you want to know the true situation of the lives of most overseas Chinese in France, you can investigate here. Strictly speaking, this is not a formal business. It is just a few unemployed people from Qingtian County, Zhejiang, who are stranded overseas, helping each other and doing some scattered business to make a living. Speaking of the people of Qingtian in France, many people will naturally think of a group of adventurers full of romance who walked through Siberia, crossed the Ural Mountains, and relied on selling stones for a living along the way. The reporter was also attracted by this romantic story, and took advantage of the short stay in Paris to specifically visit this group of Qingtian people several times, hoping to obtain some story materials narrated by them personally to report to the people of the country. However, after several investigations, it was discovered that the people who relied on selling Qingtian stones to walk to Europe are already an old generation's past events. The people who personally experienced it have either died or are sick, and the surviving elders who can be found are only four in Paris. Even these four surviving adventurers are now sick, disabled, and old, and their actions are very inconvenient. The reporter made several appointment requests, but they were not fulfilled, which is a great regret. Although the more than 400 Qingtian people who now live near this small alley have also fled to this foreign land in order to escape the pressure of life and find a way out, their experiences are far less heroic than those of the previous generation. Therefore, there are no romantic adventure stories worth praising among them, only some tragic experiences of being tortured by life and mistreated by foreigners, which may arouse the pity of kind-hearted people, but will not win the admiration of those who worship heroes.</p>
<p>It is said that there are about 2,000 overseas Chinese in France (referring to Chinese people who make a living in France, not the dignitaries who fly in today and fly away tomorrow), most of whom are from Guangdong and Qingtian, Zhejiang. Among them, about 800 live in Paris, with the number of people from Guangdong and Zhejiang being comparable. Because of different residences and different ways of making a living, they rarely interact with each other. The people of Guangdong seem to be better at business management, so among the people of Guangdong, there are occasionally families with small wealth. The several decent Chinese restaurants in Paris now, except for Shenjiang Paradise, are all opened by people from Guangdong. The people of Zhejiang are almost all from Qingtian, and they all live in the small alleys near the Lyon station, and they are almost all extremely poor. Although they also barely support five or six noodle restaurants, the business is very sluggish, and it is difficult to maintain the expenses of a family. The time they arrived in France varies. Among the more than 20 people the reporter spoke with, the earliest arrived in France 18 years ago, and the latest 11 years ago. So when they came, they were young, energetic, and adventurous adults, but now they are gradually aging, and they cannot help but think of their homeland. The motives for coming were different. Most of them took a boat from Shanghai to France to work as laborers. After World War I, France lacked labor and needed to recruit it overseas, and the people of Qingtian flocked to France to take risks because of the promotion of the previous generation of stone sellers. For more than ten years, they have barely maintained their lives from hand to mouth. Those who are relatively lucky and can save a little have married French wives. According to what they told the reporter, about half of them have started families in Paris, and most of them have children. The oldest is 18 years old and is studying in a French school, and is considered a French person. Since the end of the war, a total of more than 30 people have recently returned home with their families, which is obviously the luckiest of them and is envied by their peers. Those who remain in France now do not have the money to return home, and at the same time, they are not sure of making a living after returning home, so they can only continue to remain in France, living one day at a time.</p>
<p>Strict Restrictions by the French</p>
<p>During the German occupation, the Germans did not discriminate or persecute the compatriots excessively. They were allowed to continue operating small businesses and small restaurants. Those who lost their jobs in factories because the factories were closed also switched to doing small businesses, and their lives could still be barely maintained. It is said that during the German occupation, not a single compatriot died at the hands of the Germans. However, once French bandits came to rob a small noodle shop, and a dispute arose, resulting in one compatriot being shot dead by the bandits. The murderer has not been apprehended to this day, and the case has not been closed. However, the Germans conscripted Chinese laborers to build defensive fortifications near Paris. On two occasions, they were attacked by Allied aircraft, and a total of more than 30 compatriots died. In 1940, Germany ordered the Vichy government to send young men to Germany for military service. The Vichy authorities sent compatriots to make up the numbers. They had already been sent to Berlin, but because the German authorities insisted on only wanting French people, the compatriots who had already been sent were sent back to French territory, and they were safe and sound.</p>
<p>Now that France has been restored, factories have resumed operations one after another, and some compatriots have returned to the factories. The daily wage is about 300 francs (equivalent to 60 or 70 cents in US dollars), which is only enough for personal subsistence. Because most compatriots cannot read French, they cannot learn or take on more sophisticated and specialized work, and the wages cannot be high. The rest of the people make belts, wallets, and the like and sell them on the street, and they can also earn 400 or 500 francs a day. What they feel most painful about is that whether doing business or working in France, they must obtain a permit from the French government, otherwise they will be punished if they are caught doing it secretly. And when these compatriots arrived in France, their passports were not properly handled, and they had no idea about the current system of laws and regulations in France; therefore, they were often punished for minor offenses. Local students publish a mimeographed Chinese newspaper, and the overseas Chinese rely entirely on this newspaper to understand the national situation. They also know that China is now one of the five major powers, so they sent people to the embassy to request that the embassy negotiate with the French authorities to issue permits for compatriots to work or do business, but our current embassy in Paris does not pay attention to the requests of these poor compatriots at all. Therefore, in March of this year, they held a meeting and decided to submit four petitions to the country, one to Chairman Chiang, one to President Song, one to Minister Wang, and the other to Minister Chen Cixiu based on hometown relationships, requesting relief and asking them to order the embassy to assist in handling the work permits. The replies from Minister Song and Minister Wang came very early, saying that they had separately sent letters to the embassy to handle the matter at the appropriate time. The compatriots also found out from the embassy that the letters from Song and Wang had indeed been sent to the embassy in April, but the embassy did not take any action. This time, Minister Wang came to Paris in person for the European Peace Conference, and the compatriots sent representatives to present the actual situation in person. On September 3, the Paris overseas Chinese held a meeting to celebrate our country's Victory Day. That evening, the compatriots took the opportunity to invite Minister Wang to attend the meeting and give instructions, giving Minister Wang the opportunity to see the overseas Chinese community in person and urging the embassy to work hard to negotiate. The situation may improve somewhat in the future.</p>
<p>Now the overseas Chinese in Paris have different opinions on the matter of wanting to return to their motherland. People who still have brothers and sisters in the country mostly want to go back to visit, so they are all looking forward to the opportunity to return home. On the other hand, they believe that if they can find a job in France and earn 300 or 400 francs a day, then although life is hard, at least they will not starve. Before leaving the country, they had already tasted the bitterness of unemployment, and they do not believe that they will have better luck this time when they go back. Even if they find a job in the country, the remuneration and treatment cannot keep up with that in France, so they would rather continue to work in France. Both of these hopes are based on facts. If the authorities can help these compatriots, it seems that both paths can be pursued at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="e174">A Tragedy of Optimism <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Hualin</p>
<p>It is impossible in life to satisfy one's own happiness; one can only "beautify" life with a transcendent spirit, breaking free from all realistic shackles, using courage to escape all the depression of life! A tragic life should not be painful any longer! We should be happy, we should laugh, we should sing and dance. We roar on lonely mountaintops, we swim in the tide of the raging sea. We savor the taste of pain, making it the material of our songs. We jump into the abyss of darkness, making it our human game. Nietzsche said: "Those with great desires have great contempt and great disgust." To heal pessimism, one should overcome it with a transcendent and progressive spirit of happiness! Therefore, he advocated the "Übermensch," because when people reach their greatest despair, they will generate the greatest new hope!</p>
<p>"Megalos's" sunset sculpture is a male figure. He turns to close his eyes, unwilling to see the terrifying situation of internal turmoil at the time, hoping that it will die, leaving only a little memorial. Juyou also said in his philosophical poem, I follow my path, walking towards a distant future. The brilliance of dawn, the beautiful future, is my precious life! Why is it so warm? Because it is still distant, which shows that only hope is sweet! He also said, "The highest joy almost brings tears!" These transcendent feelings all contain much pain. Nietzsche also said, "To know the greatest joy, one must first know the greatest pain." Juyou also had the same sentiment, saying that earnestness creates pain. Perhaps reduced to death, no matter what happens, my eyes will always look straight ahead!</p>
<p>A tragedy of optimism: that is, using a transcendent spirit to prevent life from falling into depravity and prison, using courage to escape the shackles and depression of reality! Cheer! Sing! Grow wings and dance! Dance on water, fall on fire, dance on all the injustices of the world! Treading on the rhythm of the universe, experiencing the game of humanity. My shadow calls to me, shrouding me, it plunges me into the abyss of darkness, but I can leave it, escape it, and save myself, because I have great contempt and great disgust. I raise my head, raise my hands, and my legs also jump up, as if growing wings, flying to the mountaintop, flying to the distant morning star. I bow my head and smile at the abyss. Wise philosophers are always laughing there! "Laugh!" Like an innocent child!</p>

<p>— By Czech Čapek, translated by Jiang Si</p>
<p>Catching a Moth</p>
<p>A person sits with a book or newspaper in his hand; suddenly, he raises his head, his eyes following something in the air, as if looking at an invisible picture. Then he jumps up, grabs with his hand, and then kneels down, slapping the ground with his palm. He jumps up again, grabbing at emptiness; runs to a corner, clapping his hands; slaps the wall, and then carefully looks at his hand. Then, helplessly shaking his head, he walks back and sits down, suspiciously looking at the corner he just slapped. Three seconds later, he leaps up again, jumps into the air, clapping his hands, falls to the ground, hitting the walls and furniture, frantically waving his arms, jumping around, his head turning back and forth, and then sits down again. Five seconds later, he jumps up again, performing this ritualistic dance all over again.</p>
<p>Chasing a Tram</p>
<p>For this, you need a tram that is about to depart. At this time, a person going to the tram stop turns around and starts moving his legs faster, the motion like a pair of scissors; then he skips lightly like a ballet dancer, and then runs at a slow pace, smiling as if he is just playing around. Then, he holds down his hat with one hand and starts running as hard as he can. The tram, which did indeed wait for a while, now departs at full speed. The person chasing the tram runs a few steps in despair, but the tram rumbles past indifferently. At this time, the person chasing the tram comes to the conclusion that he cannot catch the tram, his enthusiasm collapses and disappears; he runs a few steps forward with weak leaps, and then stops, waving his hand at the departed tram, as if saying: "It doesn't matter, go to hell if you want, go! I can wait for the second tram—a better one than you!"</p>
<p>Walking the Dog</p>
<p>A person walking a dog often thinks he is leading the dog, rather than the dog pulling him. If the dog wants to smell something, its owner also stops, looking at the surrounding buildings or scenery; and when the dog squats down to relieve itself (which lowers the status of its owner), its owner slowly lights a cigarette, or pretends that he needs to stay here for a while, indicating that he is pondering something, completely unaware of what his dog is doing at this time.</p>
<p>Stumbling</p>
<p>A person slips on something, or suddenly changes the rhythm of his steps for some completely external reason. He often waves his arms in surprise, as if trying to grab someone, and suddenly uses the most undignified haste to regain his lost balance. But after doing so, he continues walking with a noticeable and energetic agility, as if saying to everyone passing by: "Hey, what are you staring at? Did you think I was going to fall? Hey, I didn't fall, but what does that have to do with you? Can't you see that I'm striding forward now?"</p>
<p>Avoiding Mud</p>
<p>A person crossing a puddle of mud really does this. He first stands by the puddle thinking of a way to cross it without getting his feet wet; then he takes light steps, like a cat, stepping only on his toes; then he concentrates, jumping in the puddle, changing direction, and proceeding very carefully; however, unexpectedly, he happens to step in the deepest and dirtiest part of the mud. At that time, the person trying to avoid the mud shows a "ouch" face; he stops dejectedly for a while, and then struggles out of the deepest part of the puddle. In the long journey, like the journey of life, this is called accepting fate.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Office Gossip <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Kuo</p>
<p>The office is the easiest place to be bored. When busy, everyone shouts that there are not enough people, and if more people are not added, they will have to ask for leave to go home and see their uncles; when idle, everyone is redundant, as if an office only needs three or five people to cope with ease.</p>
<p>So everyone stops complaining, watching those three or five people lowering their heads and working on official business, while the rest find their own ways to pass the time.</p>
<p>Old Liang, who is most particular about calligraphy, is the first to pull out a sheet of official stationery from the wire basket, dip his small writing brush in thick ink, and meticulously copy his most proud "Diamond Sutra":</p>
<p>"Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was in the Jetavana Grove of Anathapindika's Park in Sravasti..."</p>
<p>This is his greatest invention: writing small characters both cultivates temperament and deceives the boss's eyes. While others are chatting idly, only Old Liang, Old Liang is always bent over, writing stroke by stroke, as if he has official business to do, perhaps even busier than those three or five gentlemen who are busy with official business.</p>
<p>Others naturally pull out a copy or two of square weekly magazines from their drawers to give themselves a little relaxation, but they all remain silent and do not disturb others. Only Little Wang and Little Li, the youngest and most frivolous, put their feet on the desk, chatting about everything under the sun, specializing in office news, and no one knows where they get so much. Those who like to talk love to talk, and those who like to listen love to listen, no one investigates the source, anyway, just pass the time.</p>
<p>Little Wang said:</p>
<p>"Little Li, Section Chief Xue's luck has come, he recently got a new girl, a singer..."</p>
<p>"Hmm!"</p>
<p>Little Li, in order to hear more clearly, tilted his body, and the foot and chair propped up on the desk lost their balance, suddenly leaning onto Old Liang sitting behind him. Old Liang was writing:</p>
<p>"...begging completed..."</p>
<p>The tail of the word "completed" was stretched very long, like a fox running in the snow with its tail dragging. Old Liang was very unhappy, picked up the sheet of official stationery, turned around, and pointed it to Little Li:</p>
<p>"Look, a good Diamond Sutra... Young people don't leave any oral virtue, specializing in talking about other people's privacy..."</p>
<p>Little Li clapped his hands and laughed:</p>
<p>"I know, Old Liang, we both understand each other, I won't talk about you!"</p>
<p>Old Liang frowned:</p>
<p>"Me? A real man sits upright and stands upright, not afraid of you talking!"</p>
<p>Little Li nodded hurriedly:</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, I said too much. Yesterday at the entrance of the welfare company,... Aiya... I won't say it, I won't say it..."</p>
<p>"Pah!"</p>
<p>Old Liang spat into the spittoon, then sat up straight again, pulled out a new sheet of official stationery from the wire basket:</p>
<p>"People just need to sit upright and stand upright,... um..."</p>
<p>He dipped his small writing brush in the inkpad and began to copy his Diamond Sutra again!</p>
<p>"Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was in the Jetavana Grove of Anathapindika's Park in Sravasti..."</p>
<p>Old Liang could spare Little Li, but Little Wang couldn't spare Little Li. He leaned over hard, tugged at Little Li's sleeve, and asked in a low voice:</p>
<p>"What? Little Li, what? Old Liang's romance?..."</p>
<p>Little Li pretended to pull his sleeve away, acting very serious:</p>
<p>"Nothing, promised others, not to say, a gentleman's agreement!"</p>
<p>The difficulty was that Little Wang and Little Li also had a gentleman's agreement, so Little Li had to say softly:</p>
<p>"Actually, there's nothing much, yesterday I saw Old Liang accompanying a young lady at the entrance of the Great Brightness Theater..."</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, Little Wang jumped up:</p>
<p>"Big news, Old Liang is a gentleman... Wow!..."</p>
<p>With such big news in his stomach, Little Wang simply couldn't hold it in. He left Little Li and circled around the office, whispering in Zhang Fang's ear:</p>
<p>"Old Liang has a romance, he hooked up with a pretty girl yesterday and went to see a movie at the Great Brightness."</p>
<p>Zhang Fang laughed, raised his head and looked at Old Liang's back, who was writing the Diamond Sutra, a little disbelieving, such an old man?</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>Little Wang patted his chest:</p>
<p>"Lie to you? Little Li saw it with his own eyes!"</p>
<p>Yue Daoming, sitting opposite Zhang Fang, curiously leaned over:</p>
<p>"What's the matter, what's the matter?"</p>
<p>Little Wang raised his thumb:</p>
<p>"Go ask him!" He circled around to another place.</p>
<p>Zhang Fang leaned his head hard towards Yue Daoming, and said softly:</p>
<p>"Old Liang, that gentleman, is also playing with women. Yesterday someone saw him accompanying a very pretty girl, very intimately, watching a movie at the Great Brightness.</p>
<p>"And after the movie?"</p>
<p>"Maybe they had dinner at the International Hotel, who knows..."</p>
<p>Yue Daoming turned his head with a belly full of laughter, patted Yan Tizhi's shoulder:</p>
<p>"Old Liang, this person really deserves a second look, yesterday someone saw him hugging a pretty girl, watching a movie at the Great Brightness, and after the movie they went to the International Hotel to eat, wow!"</p>
<p>Yan Tizhi stuck out his tongue.</p>
<p>"Not sure, not sure, did you go into the International Hotel with him?"</p>
<p>Yue Daoming shook his head; Yan Tizhi was very proud:</p>
<p>"That's right, how can you guarantee that he didn't rent a room?"</p>
<p>He couldn't sit still any longer, threw down the tabloid he was holding, and dragged his chair to the desk next to him:</p>
<p>"Ah Huang, Ah Huang, I'll report a piece of news to you, do you know this Old Liang?"</p>
<p>"That's a gentleman, all he knows is writing the Diamond Sutra all day long."</p>
<p>The one who stuck out his tongue!</p>
<p>"Now he has a romance, yesterday he and a girl watched a movie at the Great Brightness, the two of them hugging, um, maybe they even rented a car, and after the movie they went to the International Hotel to rent a room..."</p>
<p>Ah Huang turned his head to look at Old Liang, and then turned to another corner: Old Xu was sitting there calculating with an abacus, not knowing whether he was calculating official accounts or private accounts. Ah Huang walked over with a straight face!</p>
<p>"Old Xu, I have something to talk to you about."</p>
<p>Old Xu hurriedly pushed the abacus aside:</p>
<p>"Please, please..."</p>
<p>"Your brother-in-law is having an affair, yesterday someone saw... um... at the International Hotel... We don't ask about relatives, but you have to persuade him, his reputation as a gentleman these past few years has not been easy..."</p>
<p>Old Xu left before it was time to leave the office. When Old Liang returned home, Mrs. Liang was lying on the bed crying, Old Xu was sitting there sighing, and when he saw Old Liang, he sighed listlessly:</p>
<p>"Brother-in-law, you're too wrong, you've been married to my sister for more than ten years..."</p>
<p>Mrs. Liang suddenly jumped up from the bed:</p>
<p>"You don't have to talk to him, if he can do it, I can do it too, I'll fight him!"</p>
<p>She crashed into Old Liang, and the two fell on the floor, shaking the floor loudly.</p>
<p>Old Liang's niece ran over from the small room next door and said:</p>
<p>"Uncle and aunt, don't be angry, I heard what you just said, it's not true, yesterday afternoon my uncle accompanied me to buy things, I was with my uncle all afternoon, and my uncle accompanied me back, and my uncle hasn't left the house since he came back, my aunt also knows that."</p>
<p>The rice in the kitchen was already burnt, and a burnt fragrance rose upstairs.</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Plunging into the Devil's Den</p>
<p>That evening (July 28th), when I was about to leave Changxindian, I called No. 04 again to reiterate the things he should handle, telling him to try his best to handle them properly. After finishing the matter, he could come to Beiping to find me, and I told him the location, saving him the trouble of exploring.</p>
<p>At this time, within a circle of thirty to forty miles around Beiping, it could be said to be very chaotic. Gunshots and artillery fire, crazy hissing and roaring, several places were emitting smoke and fire. On the road into the city, some sections were as calm as ancient roads, and some sections had scouts coming and going like shuttles, shouting orders, mixed with gunshots, erupting at the same time; in the dim night, along the road, one could often see groups of men, women, old and young, on the side of the road, like ghostly shadows, carrying heavy steps, heading in the direction they thought was safe, sighs mixed with the cries of children.</p>
<p>A little after ten o'clock, I returned to Mr. W's headquarters. At this time, probably because he was busy, his office had two more message receivers, one answering the phone, and one receiving and sending secret telegrams. I briefly told him about the Changxindian incident; and asked him to quickly point out a method that could settle Dingyuan's problem. This was not because I was unfamiliar with the situation in Beiping, in fact, I was putting the entire burden of Dingyuan on his shoulders; because I had to leave for Tongxian immediately. Mr. W did not hesitate slightly, and immediately ordered someone to send Dingyuan to the Xiehe Hospital, saying that he would think of a solution after seeing the situation in a short period of time.</p>
<p>He also briefly told me about the situation in Beiping—Song Zheyuan had arrived in Zhuozhou, and the surviving generals of the 29th Army also retreated with him, Zhang Zizhong was now in the city, shouldering the heavy burden of governing the military and politics, and Tianjin was the responsibility of Li Wentian—he said, "It's a pity that this kind of measure was handled a little too late, and many generals, soldiers and civilians were sacrificed in vain."</p>
<p>I raised the issue of going to Tongxian and asked him to send a car and two assistants to go with me. He did everything, and mentioned a few points that should be paid attention to. He said that the entire territory of Tongxian was a hell, if the meaning of "hell" was so chaotic, terrifying, dark, and miserable. From Beiping to Tongxian, a distance of more than forty miles, the devil's hands of the Japanese and puppets were everywhere, seizing and slaughtering at will. The city of Tongxian was simply a world of ghosts and monsters, and if one's eyes were not bright, every step was thorns and traps.</p>
<p>"Whether from a political or humanitarian standpoint, we must use all our strength to turn it over." Mr. W said calmly, "It's a pity that... we originally planned to implement the planned actions early this morning, before the Japanese's 'dawn attack', to disrupt the little devils' rear lines and extinguish their enthusiasm. This would also have a considerable effect in military affairs; it's a pity that Yaoqun and Little Tiger went a day late, and the arrangement was a little bit off."</p>
<p>At this time, I was lying on a soft chair to rest, eating something to restore my strength, while listening to him speak. When I heard him mention Yaoqun and Little Tiger, I immediately sat up, wanting to ask him a few questions.</p>
<p>Mr. W immediately stretched out his hand to make a gesture of pressing down and said, "You should still lie down and rest, I know what you want to say—you think that Yaoqun and Little Tiger, those two young children, how could their actions have such a big relationship, how could going a day late delay the entire action? In this way, our secret work is simply a bit of a child's play, isn't it?" As he said this, he immediately took out two letters from the document stack:</p>
<h3 id="e180">Marguerite Audoux <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Da Chun</p>
<p>Marguerite Audoux lost her parents when she was young and was raised by nuns in an orphanage. After leaving the orphanage, she worked as a shepherdess on a farm in Sologne. Later, she went to Paris to work as a seamstress. Around 1910, she wrote two autobiographical novels about her childhood experiences and working life in a simple and touching realistic style, namely Marie Claire and Marie Claire's Studio (L'atelier de Marie Claire). After the publication of her debut work, Marie Claire, it immediately shocked the literary world, and Mirbeau considered it a masterpiece. As a result, she received the French "Femina Literary Prize" (Prix Femina) in 1910, and the book has sold more than 100,000 copies to date. After Marie Claire's success, she lived alone on the top floor of a small house on Leopold Robert Street in the Montparnasse district, until the last few months before her death.</p>
<p>Audoux knew deeply that in order to live, she had to work hard, so from then on, she wrote day and night, and could also relieve her loneliness. She spent a total of thirty years of writing life. Her appearance in the literary world was as sudden as lightning. Her mission was to spread that rare thing among us: purity. Mirbeau once said to her:</p>
<p>"You, you are an angel!"</p>
<p>This sentence was not an exaggeration. In that poor little house, she often received all visitors with a compassionate heart: her friends, great writers, great artists, or unknown people. When those people first arrived at her place, they always felt burdened with fatigue and frustration. But after listening to her conversation and looking at her face, they gradually felt relieved and felt that everything had been washed away. She would often first open the green curtain in front of the window in the small dining room, point to the flower pots that decorated the window sill, and say to the visitor in an appetizing Sologne accent: "Please take a look at my garden first! Then we'll chat."</p>
<p>In winter, a heart-shaped small fire embers "snored beside her desk. While mixing the fire in "carefully", she handed a large willow armchair—this was her only good armchair—to her friend to sit on, and sat beside her, smiling and said:</p>
<p>"Please tell me all your little troubles." and clear, a harmonious and beautiful sentence. When Charles-Louis Philippe, Francis Jourdain, Mirbeau and many other writers saw her repeatedly revised exercise books and appreciated her works, they were all surprised. I can't help but ask: Who taught this seamstress such writing and such a style?</p>
<p>Audoux replied to this strange question: "I don't know at all! I didn't learn at all! But I dreamed very hard in my life!"</p>
<p>This is her mystery. She dreamed very hard, and suffered very hard? She leaned over the desk with a sick body, her sick eyes staring at the paper, and went to the world she had lost to find those voices, those fragrances, and those lights.</p>
<p>This honorable woman did not think of a little bright sunshine until the end of October 1936, when she went to Saint-Raphael to recuperate. She lived there for three months, and finally died there on February 1, 1937. Audoux's departure from the world was not only the loss of a great writer in the French literary world, but also the loss of a pure light in the world.</p>
<p>She worked hard all her life, and the masterpieces she left us, in addition to the above two books, also include Fiancée, From City to Mill, and the belatedly completed Dovcelumiere, etc., Dovcelumiere is another Marie Claire-type work.</p>

<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Here is a small story to encourage our colleagues in the field.</p>
<p>That was the United Nations Food Conference held in Hot Springs, Virginia, USA in the summer of 1944. The meeting was held on May 18, and it was decided in advance that representatives from all countries should not meet with newspaper reporters, and new reporters were restricted from entering the Garden Hotel where the representatives were staying. This decision naturally aroused protests from reporters from various countries, and the New York Times frankly criticized "this will create a bad precedent"...... After the reporters' requests, the US Congress's debate, and the protests of most newspaper editorials, finally, the US government finally gave in and cancelled those bans.</p>
<p>Freedom will not fall from the sky, it must be fought for. If our freedom of the press does not harm the freedom of others, we are determined to fight for freedom. The United Nations Food Conference is just one of thousands of examples.</p>

<h3 id="e182">The Lie Detector <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Traveler</p>
<p>According to the Shen Bao of October 5th, the police bureau recently planned to allocate a portion of the prize money donated by Mr. Rong Desheng to purchase equipment for criminal police. Among the new equipment is a lie detector. It is said that this machine can immediately determine the truthfulness of a suspect's statement during interrogation. The so-called lie detector has been used since 1921 at the Berkeley Police Department in California, USA. It has more than a decade of history, and with its assistance, police have narrowed the scope of investigations, saving a lot of time, money, and energy. Therefore, it has become a common criminal investigation tool for police departments in Europe and the United States. However, in the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai, it is only now being considered for purchase. Here is a brief introduction to its principles, structure, and uses:</p>
<p>You Can't Lie</p>
<p>The lie detector is not a magical device. It is simply a machine that records changes in the human body, just like a thermometer or stethoscope used by doctors during diagnosis. During the interrogation of criminals, it can be used to determine whether the criminal's statement is true based on its recordings, because changes in the human body are caused by the liar's emotional changes. In ancient China, when interrogating suspects, people often gave them rice flour to chew and spit out. If the spit-out rice flour was dry, they were considered guilty. A hundred years ago, an American prison guard named Coman provided a scientific explanation for this Chinese method of interrogating criminals: Coman experimented with dogs and found that fear, anger, and pain could completely stop the peristaltic movement of saliva in the internal organs, preventing it from flowing into the mouth. Even if the rice flour was held in the mouth for a long time, it would not become moist. The current lie detector is based on this principle.</p>
<p>The current lie detector is divided into three parts: one part measures and records the subject's breathing, one part records changes in pulse rate and blood pressure, and another part measures subtle electrical changes in the skin's electrical resistance. These bodily changes can be recorded simultaneously on a moving piece of paper, which is driven by an electric motor (whose normal speed is directly proportional to the current frequency). Each part is an independent unit and can act alone. When these three parts work together, they create the so-called lie detector.</p>
<p>The results recorded by the lie detector, after a clear explanation by the staff, can determine whether the person being investigated is telling the truth. Therefore, a staff member using a lie detector must have a precise mind, calm observation, and rigorous training to be able to use this delicate machine effectively, just like the qualities a good doctor should possess.</p>
<p>Confessing Without Being Beaten</p>
<p>The uses of the lie detector are truly vast: it can find stolen property, it can check fugitives who are being pursued elsewhere, it can release innocent people who have been implicated, it can help examine witnesses to see if their evidence is accurate, it can help police officers find the culprit, it can investigate cunning criminals who kill their wives and falsely report to the police that their wives were killed, and it can investigate corrupt officials who embezzle warehouse goods and destroy them with fire.</p>
<p>The first case solved by the Berkeley Police Department using a lie detector was a murder case: a young girl in Berkeley was killed, and all indications pointed to a crime of passion. The police brought all the suspects into the station and interrogated them individually, but they could not find out who the murderer was. They had to resort to the newly invented lie detector. The first few people tested did not show any criminal reactions in their bodies. When the ninth person was tested, the diagrams drawn on the lie detector proved that he was guilty. They showed him the records, and he confessed without hesitation. If ordinary investigation methods had been used to solve this case, it would have taken much more time and effort. Furthermore, in this situation, if there had been no lie detector, the case probably could not have been solved so easily.</p>
<h3 id="e183">About Steel Wire Recording <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Ran</p>
<p>Upon seeing a section in today's newspaper (October 6th Shen Bao) about Mr. Chen Deliang being specially invited to speak at the Chinese Export Commodities Exhibition on "Steel Wire Recording," I was reminded of some things about this steel wire recording!</p>
<p>Our country's steel wire recording has just been successfully invented by Mr. Chen Deliang, truly a highlight of our country's scientific community!</p>
<p>However, steel wire recording already existed in the United States, but they only used it for military purposes and kept it a great secret, refusing to reveal any information about it. Therefore, Mr. Chen personally created it himself.</p>
<p>In fact, the principle of steel wire recording was invented fifty years ago by the Dane Poulsgo, but no one paid attention to it at the time. It was not until the Second World War that the Soviet youth Camras officially invented and successfully created it in the United States, truly marking a great revolution in the science of recording.</p>
<p>Currently, there are three types of recording methods: one is mechanical, which is the most common type of record currently used. It records sound on a wax disc, but it is damaged after being used several times, and all of its components are very bulky, making it inconvenient in certain venues, and it can only record for three minutes. The second type is optical, which is mostly used in sound films. It is a thin line of shadow next to the film, but sound is emitted through the action of light and electricity. Of course, the price is also very expensive. The third type is steel wire recording, also called magnetic recording. It relies only on an extremely thin steel wire, but it is not an ordinary steel wire. It is formed through a strong or weak magnetism. When it is played back, the steel only needs to be reinserted between the poles of an electromagnet at a speed of about two feet per second, and then the sound can be emitted through an amplifier, and the sound is very clear. At the same time, one recording can be repeated 200,000 times without changing, and it is still very clear. When it is no longer needed, it can be automatically erased by a magnetization method, and then a second recording can be made.</p>
<p>In short, this method is equivalent to writing white words on a blackboard, and it is convenient and quick to use. For example, if a dignitary gives a speech somewhere, it can be recorded at the time and immediately taken to the broadcasting station to be broadcast, without having to repeat making any plates, and it can be broadcast for at least an hour or more.</p>
<p>Therefore, everything at the recent San Francisco Peace Conference used this steel wire recording as a record.</p>

<p>— Ben Xun</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Jia Ling's "Sleeping for Thirty-Nine Years" in the "Free Talk" column of this newspaper on October 6th, I couldn't help but recall an interesting story I heard when I was in school, "Sleeping Through a Century." My classmate said: "If you go to bed before 12:00 PM on December 31, 1999, and wake up the next day, it will be January 1, 2000. Wouldn't that mean he slept from the 20th century to the 21st century?"</p>
<h3 id="e185">"Many Monks and Taoists in the Gates of Hell" <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Mang</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Director of Civil Affairs, Mr. Zhang Xiaosong, proposed borrowing or allocating abandoned temples and monasteries as offices because there was no land for offices in various districts, implying the benefit of public service. Before he could finish speaking, it aroused the true fire of samadhi of bald-headed monks, who held meetings, formed teams, paraded, and petitioned, making a big splash and causing a city-wide uproar, violating the Buddhist principle of "benefiting oneself and benefiting others." Examining the Sangha, there are many who cultivate "precepts, concentration, and wisdom," but there are also many who violate the five precepts of "killing, stealing, adultery, lying, and drinking," especially the monks in Shanghai. As the saying goes, "Many monks and Taoists in the gates of hell." Indeed, here is an order from Emperor Taizu of Ming regarding Chinese monks after the war:</p>
<p>"Today, most of the monks in the world are mixed with the common people, and many are even worse than the common people. They enter the religion but ruin their conduct. It is reasonable to purify their ranks and complete their sect. After the order is issued, Chan practitioners should practice Chan, lecturers should lecture, and Yogis should practice Yoga, each according to their sect. Those with wives and children who wish to return to secular life may do so, and those who wish to practice [religious practice] may do so. After this order, anyone who dares not enter the monastery, still privately has family members, secretly lives among the people, and is reported to the government or caught by officials, must have their "heads cut off" to show the public. Those who harbor them will be exiled three thousand li."</p>
<p>Historically, there was this Sangha law, which also illustrates the dark side of monks and Taoists, and the contempt that monks and nuns have suffered is not without reason. We should re-evaluate the hypocrisy and compassion of those who constantly chant Amitabha Buddha!</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3 id="e186">Horse Racing · Concubinage <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Fu</p>
<p>The municipal government's expenditures exceed its income, so someone proposed restoring horse racing to increase government revenue. This publication conducted a public opinion poll, and the majority opposed the restoration. The city council also discussed this issue, and two opposing opinions emerged, which could not be resolved.</p>
<p>However, regardless of whether horse racing can be restored, the municipal government's deficit is an obvious fact, and ways to make up for it must be sought. The means and methods are nothing more than taxation and increased donations. For example, the current entertainment tax has directly affected the operation of theaters due to its increase.</p>
<p>It is said that the Hong Kong government is also experiencing an economic panic?</p>
<p>On September 23, the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce discussed the issue of "increasing tax revenue in Hong Kong" at a routine meeting. Yuan Jiancheng, a representative of the catering industry, immediately proposed a method that would "increase government revenue without increasing the burden on merchants and without affecting the prosperity of the market"—levying a "concubine tax."</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan also added: "I propose that anyone who takes a concubine should pay a tax of 20,000 yuan per person, with more taxes levied for more concubines. In this way, the Hong Kong government can broaden its tax base, and the general public will not increase their burden. Isn't that a win-win situation?"</p>
<p>Listening to Mr. Yuan's words, he seems quite confident. Hong Kong is, after all, a place where "high-class Chinese" gather. Taking a concubine is like buying a car or a foreign house, and it's not a big deal. Despite the fact that families in the disaster areas of the motherland are selling their wives and children, they can still have three wives and two concubines. Therefore, Mr. Yuan has foresight and is afraid of tax evasion, so he specifically added: "More taxes levied for more concubines."</p>
<p>But Hong Kong is, after all, a semi-changed Hong Kong. Otherwise, our "horse-protecting" gentlemen could write an article: "People use concubinage to collect taxes, why can't we rely on horse racing to collect donations!"</p>
<h3 id="e187">Odds and Ends <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— NW</p>
<p>Important figures can fill the position of × Director, and can also concurrently hold the position of × Director, with three heads and six arms, and the able are overworked, which means that when one has achieved success, they can retire honorably, and holding a few titles can also create a real business, running a company, and the family that accumulates virtue has plenty of blessings, the more the better. People have the same mind, and there are ways to get in, and there is no way to stop them; no wonder a hole was left when the money was cast. To this day, "Brother Kong Fang" is still well-known to women and children, and famous at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Autumn wind blows, minds are confused, especially the ladies. First of all, the style of the coat has become a problem. Secondly, are the sleeves of the cheongsam inside long, short, or neither long nor short? From empty words of discussion to practical observation, referring to the progressive Western culture and researching the classical art of the national essence, they still dare not decide. They are even more humble and eager to learn, and they are not ashamed to ask the willows by the road and flowers on the wall. Finally, they must consult the master tailor and listen to the great cut. Last year was short, this year is long, next year is short, and the year after next year is long. In the eyes of men, the old bottle is filled with old wine, and there is no epoch-making special change. The men's coats on the back are sometimes separated and sometimes closed, called "1946", but in reality, "it is already old".</p>
<p>After a long period of division, there must be unity, and after a long period of unity, there must be division. This is generally the way of the world.</p>
<p>Teachers diligently guide, from knowledge to habits to health, everything is painstaking, and still in a state of [hard work and difficulty], with little food and a heavy burden, the mission is too great; therefore, teachers evade, and "floating capital" is filled, so education is in danger.</p>
<p>In the past, teachers from private schools ran to public schools, but now, it is exactly the opposite; it is not that the teachers are rebelling, but that life is rebelling. Life, i.e., treatment, has replaced the imported phrase "life is education." Alas!</p>

<p>— Written by Dale Carnegie, translated by Zhuang Wenye</p>
<p>John Rockefeller performed three amazing feats in his life:</p>
<p>First, when Mr. Rockefeller first started out, he was a tenant farmer who earned only four cents an hour, but he eventually became a "king," the person who accumulated the most wealth in all of history. At that time, there were fewer than six millionaires in the United States; while Mr. Rockefeller alone accumulated between 100 million and 200 million US dollars in assets.</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Rockefeller donated more money than anyone else in history; from birth to death, he donated a total of 750 million US dollars, an average of 75 cents donated every minute, day and night.</p>
<p>Third, Mr. Rockefeller's lifespan reached the high age of ninety-seven. Among white people with millions of assets in the world, only thirty can live to the age of ninety-seven. And at this advanced age, without needing dentures, I am afraid that there is no second person among these thirty people. Mr. Rockefeller, at the age of ninety-seven, still did not have a single denture in his mouth.</p>
<p>The Secret to Longevity</p>
<p>What is his secret to longevity? Perhaps it is a tendency towards longevity given to him by nature! Perhaps this tendency is due to his calm mind and gentle temperament. He has never been angered in his life, nor has he ever been impatient. When he was managing the Mobil Corporation, there was a couch in his office at 26 Broadway. Every noon, he would take a nap on this couch for half an hour. He continued to practice this daily nap until his death.</p>
<p>Mr. Rockefeller's physical strength gradually declined at the age of fifty-five, but this was the only gospel in the history of medicine. Because of his physical discomfort, he was motivated to donate money to the medical field as funds for exploring medical scholarship. Nearly one million US dollars were withdrawn from the entire Rockefeller Foundation every day to improve human health.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1932, cholera spread in China. At that time, the author happened to be in China. Who knew that in this country plagued by poverty and disease, I could actually step into the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, founded by the Rockefeller Foundation, to receive a vaccination. Only then did I realize that even in the farthest corner of Asia or the earth, there were traces of Mr. Rockefeller's good deeds.</p>
<p>Bodyguard Escort</p>
<p>Although Mr. Rockefeller was so charitable, he was one of the most hated people in the United States. He received no fewer than thousands of letters threatening his life, so he had to have bodyguards on guard and protection day and night. Even in this emotion of horror and danger, he was still able to calmly manage and plan great enterprises.</p>
<p>Mr. Rockefeller never received a university education. He studied at a secondary school at the age of sixteen, and then attended a commercial school for a few months, never having the opportunity to study again; however, he generously donated 50 million US dollars to the University of Chicago as expenses.</p>
<p>He is indeed an admirable figure. In his youth, he vowed not to gamble, smoke, drink, dance, or watch plays, which led to his success as a great entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Recalling Youth</p>
<p>Mr. Rockefeller's industrial development led to a continuous increase in his wealth. Almost one hundred US dollars or so in the improvement of his wealth. And Mr. Rockefeller's only great wish was not to increase his wealth, but to earnestly hope that he could have a long life of a century of cycles. He said that if he could hold a grand celebration for his hundredth birthday on July 8, 1939, he would lead a band on his property at Pocantico Hills, conducting them to play the song "When you and I were Young." Unfortunately, he passed away in 1936, otherwise, it would have been another great spectacle!</p>
