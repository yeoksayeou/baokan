<h3>再莫錯過機會！</h3>
<p>中外人士所久盼的東北停戰令，昨天頒發了，今天正午起，限十五天內要談判解決懸案。這是　蔣主席明的決策，愛國愛民的決策，尤其是愛護中國共產黨而再給它一個履行協定的機會的決策。</p>
<p>爲中國人民計，自然切望共產黨切莫再錯過這一機會。即爲共產黨計，要表示他們黨員真正還有愛護祖國的觀念起見，最好也再莫錯過這一機會。</p>
<p>（一）完全停止東北衝突，（二）完全恢復國內交通，（三）迅即實施軍隊復員及整編統編的協定等三項，都是全國一致所期望急切解決的大事。今天旣有了十五天談判的機會，我們希望大家以國家爲重，以人民爲重，要十二萬分珍惜這十五天，珍惜這十五天裏的一點鐘，一分鐘，一秒鐘，絕不使它蹉跎過去，絕不使它敷衍過去，而到頭來還是一塲空話，等於不談。</p>
<p>周恩來氏說，「此十五在是休戰而非停戰。」休戰也罷，停戰也罷，我們老百姓只要求大家拿出天地良心的誠意來，說一句算一句，說一句做一句，這樣纔可真正不再錯過機會。「人言爲信」，有了「信」，然後人與人之間方可談判，黨與黨之間方可談判。我們渴望任何政黨尤其是中國共產黨，拿「信用」來保證這次和平談判的機會不再錯過。中國大局，已決不容許任何政黨用什麼口實來拖下去了；再拖將是絕路，將是死路！倘再存心錯過此一機會，使中國不能獲得和平安琮的局面，那決非中國的政治家而是中國的罪人！</p>
<p>聯總遠東區大會開幕</p>
<p>聯合國善後救濟署遠東區大會，今天在我國首都舉行。英，美，法，蘇，澳洲，印度，荷蘭，紐西蘭，菲列賓九國代表，經我國政府當局派員陪往我國各災區視察糧荒情形之後，業已到遠南京出席會議。此次會議的主要任務，固在檢討工作，加強遠東區救濟機構，但照我們看法，最急要的還應該是如何重行分配糧食，以救濟中國的三千萬饑民，使不致盡成餓莩。</p>
<p>中國抗戰爲時最久，戰禍延及全國，損失亦當然最大。淪陷區的農村，受敵僞剝削摧殘八九年，在大後方的農村，則因爲支持國家抗戰，供給廣大的人力與軍糧，田園荒蕪的淒涼景況，亦已觸目皆是。今日有三千萬的戰爭難民，淪爲嗷嗷待哺的饑民，完全是抗戰的結果。聯合國善後救濟總署竭力來救濟，原是它的職責所在。前任聯總署長李門曾電我國　蔣主席稱：「貴國人民對聯合國的共同敵人英勇抗戰，經歷艱苦歲月如許之久，永將爲全世界愛好和平人士所欽佩，其應享受聯總之援助，亦無逾於貴國人民者。」惟其如此，我國此時向聯總聲請緊急救濟，理直氣壯，受之無愧。</p>
<p>今年一月間，聯合國大會在倫敦討論救濟世界糧荒，我國代表顧維鈞大使曾要求聯總於一九四六年內供給食米一百萬噸，在原則上固曾獲得各國同意，而實際則本年第一委中國僅獲得食米一萬八千噸，第二季聯總擬配與中國食米十二萬噸，後來又減爲十萬噸，和我們實際所需要的，距離太遠了，杯水車薪，何濟於事？而且聯總分配糧食，頗不公平。我國代表蔣廷黻署長曾在聯總會議席上，據理力爭，並指責聯總糧食局分配不公，中國在本年第一季僅獲分配一萬八千噸，而馬來竟獲五萬八千噸，荷印亦得五萬五千噸，三倍於中國。分配這樣不公，我們不知聯總主持人對中國抗戰究作如何估價。後來美國救濟季員會主席胡佛氏來華調查糧荒，我國朝野又正式向其提出要求，自本年五月至八月，每月供給糧食二十萬噸，經胡佛氏親往各災區實地視察以後，認爲災情確實嚴重，就表示接受我國供給二十萬噸食米的要求。故今後的問題，乃在如何使胡佛氏的諾言由聯總之手而兌現。胡佛氏曾在上海對我們說：「從五月到九月這一個嚴重的時期內，我們必須充分發揮各種運輸的效能，每月把二十萬噸糧食分配到各地去救濟饑民。」此次聯總遠東區大會開會，我們也並無過分的奢望，只要能使胡佛的計劃先得實現，否則其他更無從談起。因爲在五月至九月的一個期間，是我國青黃不接的時期，糧食最感困難。到了全國秋收之後，糧荒情況自可稍趨緩和。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統曾爲全世界饑民呼籲，他說：「當此荒災疾病與貧困使人無法生存之際，我人絕不能獲得和平與繁榮。」我們希望出席遠東區大會的各國代表，切勿忘懷杜魯門總統的名言，尤其須知今日的遠東局勢，不論在印度或在朝鮮，特別在我國，糧荒的嚴重性，與歐洲相較，實有過之而無不及。湘省災荒情形，真可說慘絕人寰！可是在中國這樣災荒之際，暹羅華僑寗願以節食省下來的米糧運濟祖國同胞，却依然受英國的阻擋，受聯總不發運糧出口執照的牽制，使中國災民對暹羅米可望而不可即，這究竟是憑着什麼公理！中國當局在聯總遠東區大會開會時，如果默不作聲，應該受到我們人民的譴責的。</p>
<p>最後，我們對於聯總分配糧食的現行辦法，也不能不引爲憾事。糧食分配應以「實際需要」爲最高標凖，否則即失之不公，且將喪失其救濟糧荒的本意。最近外國報章雜誌盛傳「聯總之小麥，在南國恒以黑市出售；又在蘇聯，以聯總之糧食貯存，以備將來蘇軍之需用。」這皯是否謠諑，聯總有派員查明的必要。舉一反三，我們對於聯總遠東區的糧食分配問題，也堅決主張謀得一個合理妥善的辦法。</p>

<h3>英下院中一唱一和　邱吉爾與艾德禮　財聲指責蘇聯　邱：請史達林老友勿激怒美國　艾：蘇人民似生於黑暗林林中</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦五日電〕下議院外交政策辯論第二日，首相艾德禮及前首相邱吉爾捨棄國內問題之爭執，一致對蘇聯作有節制之指責（關於邱吉爾之演說，本報昨日收聽偷敦廣播已將要點刊出）邱吉爾以沉着語調曰：「自波羅的海至亞德里亞海，不僅落下一重辯幕，同時幕後有廣大土地，其人口除蘇聯之外，幾佔歐洲全人口三分之一。第三次世界大戰之種子即散佈於該得」。艾德禮對於貝文外相昨日指摘蘇聯妨碍和平途徑一層，表示完全擁護，並謂：困難所在，由於蘇聯堅持對波茨坦協辦定按照字面作嚴格的解釋，而無伸縮之餘地。余以爲蘇聯此舉實漠視吾人參加波茨坦協定之精神。蘇聯似無法了解西方各國政體及政治上之反對，此乃真正之鐵幕，即心理間之鐵幕。但余不信吾人完全應以悲觀態度判斷世界現局，余信克服當前種種困難，責任之大，無過於具文外相。</p>
<p>對蘇希望　邱吉爾對於蘇聯視英美間任何協定即爲反蘇集團，表示慨嘆。艾德禮並稱：「余完全同決與鄰國結交絕非組織集團行動，但吾人亦不欲與西方各國單獨結交，吾人所欲者實爲與世界各國廣結友邦焉」。邱吉爾旋稱：蘇聯主持中樞之少數幹練人物，對於西方民主，如此隔膜，殊不可信。刺激美國亦非蘇聯之利，英國人任何民族對外國敵對感情發展之遲鈍，無過於美國。吾人所望於蘇聯者，善意而已。蘇聯如果遭遇　　，英國自當實踐其義務，出而爲蘇聯之助。惟英國不贊成和平條約無期延擱，使數百萬人長處於天堂與地獄之半人類狀態，徒足助長道　的疫　，或者爆發積極的戰爭，亦未可知。</p>
<p>團結世界　邱氏　請擁護聯合國機構稱，此世界機構　乃吾人最後希望所寄，團結一致的世界，實勝於分崩離析的世界，但分崩離析的世界亦較破壞的世界略勝一籌也。但艾德禮則稱：吾人不欲以失望爲念，此舉足使歐洲分爲兩大陣營，吾人當與西方全體國家如比利時，荷爾，斯干的那維亞各國，尤其是法國，實行最密切之合作。德國在經濟上應視爲　整個不可分離。政治上寗以樹立聯邦爲佳，該國必須本國自力更生，吾人則當繼續工作，以謀促成其經濟統一，實現真正民主，此則更須與偉大盟邦密切合作以完成之。</p>
<p>德國問題　邱吉爾對於德國被蘇聯佔領區及西方各國佔領區分裂，表示不滿，謂蘇聯正全力使整個佔領區共產化與蘇聯化。波蘭已喪失其表示民族意志之一切自由，奧地利與匈牙利則陷飢斃窒息，不勝大批蘇軍之重壓，吾人應與德國　和，或僅與仍在吾人控制下之德國任何部份　利。吾人且應與義大利　和，該國在嚴爭最後兩年，曾爲吾人之盟邦。此種和約若不能由聯合國間之談判獲致之，則余贊同貝文外相之主張，以此事提出聯合國機構，由實際　戰之二十一國作最的之解決，並促其早日實現。</p>
<p>邱氏妙語　艾德禮　稱：吾人　望蘇聯人民，彷每日彼　　於黑暗森林之中，不知自由民主之陽光和風與空氣。邱吉爾則稱：美國鷹息於棲木，此一驚鳥內有可長之爪與啄，虎視眈眈，寂然不動，而葛羅不柯君（聯合國安全理事會蘇聯代表）日以鋒利之鐮刀向之挑撥，時而觸及其啄，時而觸及其翅，時而觸及其尾羽。美國　始終不動聲色，但若以爲觸及鷹胸時，亦將毫無動靜，則屬錯誤。余敢以此友誼的忠告，獻於戰時老同志更確定林元帥。邱氏發言至此，全塲大笑。</p>
<p>西國問題　邱吉爾與艾德禮均言及西班牙問題，邱吉爾贊成弗朗哥採取袖手旁觀政策。邱氏稱：弗朗哥政府爲「世界上侵略性最少之一　，事實上，弗朗哥統制下之西班牙，較此時之波蘭，自由更甚，共普通人民，亦享有更大之安全與舒適」。艾德禮稱：吾人必須採取最周密之行動，以推翻西班現政府，並使適當之政府取而代之。</p>

<h3>航業界表示震驚　英商藉名救濟企圖重享航權　籲請政府慎重考慮　開放內河航行權</h3>
<p>昨報載國防最高委員會通過行政院提案「開放內河航行權」，影響我國航業發展至鉅，記者特走訪本市輪船業公會秘書長李雲良、據稱航業界對於政府此種措施，極爲震驚、因英商藉運輸救濟物資作掩護，企圖重享我內河航行權，現行總租用英輪，即將於下月十五日到期，航業界迭向政府行總呼籲，現政府又將開放長江京蕪潯漢等重要港口，仍准外輪停靠，在不明航業傾象者，或謂有裨復員運輸、實則我現有商輪，已達戰前五十萬噸之數字，其中長江即佔二十餘萬噸，如國營招商局之江順，江安，江華，江新，江平，江靜等廿餘艘，民生之民權，民聯，民彝等百期艘，三北之長興，永嘉等十艘大達大通之大達，鴻大等四艘，總計在一百五十艘以上，勝利後多數無差運兵，遺俘，復員。現差運遺俘即可完畢，全部船隻可擔任復員及一般貨客運輸，載量估計，每月平均航行二次半計，來回可運百萬噸以上，而京蕪潯漢四埠，出口貨最多不過二十萬噸。目前長江下水船隻攬貨已極困難，回空噸位極多，已呈供過於求。根本原因由於各地經濟，尙未恢復常態，除重慶復員運輸外，各路貨客均稀，而行總即將有大批船隻行駛，勢成過剩現象，務請政府對開放內河航行權一舉，慎重考慮，以免收回不久之航權，輕易斷送，而使我甫現一綫曙光之航業，重行崩潰。</p>

<p>開庭後，首由檢察官宣讀起訴書，庭長逐一審問各被告，均矢口否認曾有拷打薛家人及虐殺薛和尙事。繼傳證人薛關媛，聲述即爲行凶者之一。薛泉雲亦指認野間。薛丫頭指出野間，片岡晃，早原勳三人，薛金興則謂打他之人，不在此七人內。再問野間等三人，均仍否認，並謂彼等三人因在隊中較爲出名，故被誣指。至於偵查美空軍事，係在逃之隊長大野茂指令平田及邊山（亦在逃）所爲。至此檢察官起立，謂野間及片岡自日俘管理處引渡時，有同名者各二人，但證人僅指認現在庭之被告，可見決非誣證。至於其他各被告，隸屬特高班，均與此慘案有關，請庭上依法判刑。庭長逐再問各被告有何意見，野間等仍高聲否認，尤以野間·片岡·早原勳三人態度倨傲，言帶譏刺。野間並要求將在逃之大野茂及平田設法逮捕，以明真相。審訊至六時，猶無結果，庭諭改期再訊。</p>

<h3>傅斯年對記者談　恢復當年的北大　似乎充滿了信心　當年的五四運動是反對賣國的北洋政府　現在學生運動難道反對抗戰八年的政府</h3>
<p>〔本報北平特訊〕記者今晨往訪北大校長傅斯年。傅氏髪已蒼白，但精神還不减當年，談到恢復「當年的北大」，也似乎充滿了信心，對於現在各地風起雲湧的學潮，是有些不以爲然。他說：「我對於北平臨大喜歡鬧風潮的學生，將考慮允許其轉入北大。」又說：「現在的政府，周然不盡如人意，可是這空間是抗戰八年的政府，學生有所要求是可以的，但不要逾矩，合理者我將考慮，不合理我不聽那一套！」所以他要遵照教部的一切規定，嚴明紀律，「不好的學生絕對不要！」</p>
<p>談工學院</p>
<p>北平臨大工學院的學生，曾再三向傅氏以至各有關當局請願，要求工學院獨立，不歸北大清華共管。傅氏對於這一問題說：「我真生氣，我管的是北大，正沒有那種精神去共管工學院，他們學生指說共管是帝國主義，這簡直是侮辱北大和清華的名譽！」</p>
<p>傅氏在重慶時普說過參加僞組織的教授，概不續用，所以北平臨大的教授，正在忐忑不安，聽說還在醞釀對策。記者提到此問題時，傅氏說：「那時的話可以不提了，總之我有我的教授，西南聯大的教授，拋棄其僅有的東西每人帶上十五公斤遷回北平來，爲的什麼？北大的教授，除去醫學院外，其他學院我都已請好了，在臨大醫學院執教的前協和醫院的人是可以留用的，因爲他們學業好。」</p>
<p>評周作人</p>
<p>對於周作人有這樣的評語：「他一生也沒作過一句痛快文章，甚至沒有做過一件痛快事，參加僞組織也是此種作風。」而傅氏認爲周作人「是大漢奸中罪過比較輕的。」對於錢稻蓀的評語就不然：「比起來錢稻蓀便可惡多了，聽說日本天皇發下降伏詔書以後，他還不信日本降伏是真的呢！」最後又談到「五四」時的學生運動與現在的學生運動的不同，傅氏的看法是這樣：「五四運動，是反對賣國的北洋政府，我是親身參加的，我知道得很清楚，但現在反對誰，反對抗戰八年的政府嗎？如果是那樣也就是反對學校，那我沒有辦法同情！」</p>
<p>看文相祠</p>
<p>傅氏說蔣主席在前天又邀他「擺龍門陣」二小時，一邊看文丞相祠，談了很多問題。看文丞相祠是傅氏提起的，蔣主席事前還不知道北平有個文丞相祠，共同認爲提倡民族氣節是十分必要，所以已經囑咐北平市當局，修整該祠，並要現在利用該祠作校址的府學胡同小學加意保護，因爲文大祥作正氣歌，是在此地，三年幽禁而被殺也是在此地。傅氏說那祠裏的二棵大樹，其巨枝確是南伸，指向宋朝的國都。</p>
<p>北大正在鳩工修繕校舍，爲了復員，傅氏確花費了很多的精神，他要恢復「當年的北大」。胡校長適之先生，已經由美動身，經巴拿馬運河歸國，七月可到南京，八月可到北平。由昆明復員的教職員，至北平的已經有三十多人。傅氏說無論如何，暑假後一定開學。航委會也答應幫忙復員，至六月底，全部教職員學生可至百分之八十。整個北大，可容學生四千五百人，由昆明而來的共約一千，北平臨大轉入二千，今夏再招新生一千五百人。</p>

<p>比賽盡操於華聯之手，上半時華聯以震中學崇成章松圓廣益最佳之陣綫出戰，一路領先，昆渝則爲達雲實堃相成南珍演雄，昨晚華聯合作聯絡甚佳，擲籃欠把握，否則當可大勝。下半時震中松圓休息，代以勃脫張良雄形勢大變，昆渝乘機連得九分，迨成二十六比二十八，二十九比卅一後，華聯仍無發展，昆渝竟以三十三比三十一超出，松圓再入，昆渝又見落後，成四十二比三十三，昆渝大勢已去，最後比數爲五十比四十五，唐實堃任相成甚佳，周達雲則昨晚無大建樹。</p>

<h3>殘春　（小說）　（一）</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>太陽早已從地平線下昇起來，但天空還是灰暗的，濛濛細雨瀰漫在凄冷的空氣裏，大風吹打着樹梢，整個天地，似乎被一層濃重的煙霧佈滿了，沒有光，沒有熱，沒有鳥語花香，沒有年青人天真愉悅的歡笑。</p>
<p>然而這是春天，畢竟是春天，雖在幽黑凄冷中，也有一朵很小的花在默默的開放了。</p>
<p>花沒有香味，牠太小了；而且生長在一根細長脆軟的梗枝上，似乎隨時有掉落下來的可能。可是劍光扭開了床頭的插燈，他發現花的顏色是紅的，尤其襯在一只白瓷花盆和幾瓣翠綠的嫩葉中，那一點紅，簡直紅得觸目，紅得驚人。</p>
<p>好像成了習慣，無論清晨或半夜，劍光一覺醒來，總要伸手至枕邊去摸出他的夜明錶來看看，如果快近午夜，他便等一會兒再睡着，因爲午夜十二點鐘護士要來給他量一次熱度，如果快近清晨，他當然不必再睡，因爲六點鐘就要吃藥的。現在他看了看錶，原來已經五點三刻，快到吃藥的時間了，雖然窗外還是一片漆黑，和半夜裏沒有兩樣。</p>
<p>劍光將錶放回枕邊，側着頭，奮興地望着那一朵小小的紅花。花正放在他床邊一張茶几上，是他昨天才託一個朋友去買來的。他叮囑朋友要買一株淡色的含苞的花，他要看一片片淡淡的嫩瓣從苞蕾里吐出來。想不到一夜之間，花已經默默地開放了。開放了：是這麼一個觸目驚心的紅色！</p>
<p>他撫了撫瘦癟的胸脯，覺得自己的心跳得很快，是的：他曾經愛過紅，三年前，他像瘋狂一樣追逐過紅，——紅的胭脂，紅的嘴脣，紅的指甲，紅的舞裙。……但現在，他病了，他吐出過大堆鮮血，血是紅的，比玫瑰更鮮的紅，比胭脂更豓的紅，然而是血？——何等可怕啊！</p>
<p>他不承認自己的精神有些反常，但他現在確實很怕看見紅色的東西，他定一定神，再對茶几上的小紅花用力盯了一眼，終於「啪」的一聲，將插燈扭滅了。</p>
<p>「又是紅！多殘忍的撩撥啊！」他把頭側向裏，沉痛地，低低地，在心底裏呼喊着。</p>
<p>當然他決不會再睡着，可是他的眼睛閉起來了。就在閉起來的一剎，一個潔白的身影從房門口閃了進來。</p>
<p>天色亮，烏雲，大風，細雨，沒有用，房間裏到底有幾絲淡淡的亮光了。</p>
<p>李鶯小姐的影子漸漸清晰起來了。她穿着白色的衣服，戴着白色的帽子。她的橢圓形的臉孔是白的，她的圓潤的手臂是白的，渾身都是白。然而，在一片耀眼的白裏面，顯着一點極鮮明觸目的紅，就是他的二瓣嬌嫩的紅脣。</p>
<p>劍光聽見她走進來，那輕微的脚聲是他最熟悉的：緩慢，遲疑，又似乎帶一些胆怯，那淡淡的髪香也是他最熟悉的：悠靜，清馥，又夾着一股玫瑰花的甜味，他更立刻聯想到那一點突出在純白中間的紅，——震攝他靈魂的紅啊……</p>
<p>細雨飄洒在玻窗上，的瀝答拉，李鶯小姐的橡皮鞋　落在地板上，也的瀝答拉</p>
<p>劍光知道她站在床則了。然而他不敢睜開眼，也不敢回過頭來，硬按住一顧劇烈跳蕩的心，將頭埋在枕頭裏，他眼前又飛閃過那可愛又可怕的一幕：——</p>
<p>半個月以前，春天的陽光，溫暖，明朗，充滿着醉人的色和香。</p>
<p>劍光靜坐在園裏，他的家屬，小小的，但很美麗。有垂柳，草地，魚池，假山，還有成　的香花，這時候正是午後，陽光略有些西斜，他坐在柳陰下，在急切地等待一個人。</p>
<p>似乎有些疲乏，因爲他才上一天從醫院中養病回家。他的病沒有好，醫生叮囑他回家後依舊要休養，因此他的頭漸漸向椅背上靠去，眼皮漸漸下垂，可是正在這時，一陣輕緩的脚聲使他驚跳起來。</p>
<p>正是她？她果真如約而來了啊！</p>
<p>她是李鶯，是他在醫院中認識的一位護士，她第一次捧着藥盤來餵她吃藥，他就爲她的美麗顛倒了·他覺得她像一朵紅心的白玫瑰，——一身都是白，獨有二層小巧的嘴脣，竟是出奇的紅，他爲這一點奇怪的紅迷住了！</p>
<p>他是年青的，多情的，又經歷過無限綺麗的美夢，照理不會有多大困難，然而他太軟弱了。每次她走來，他僅能用熱烈的眼睛望住她鮮紅的嘴脣，他簡直沒有力氣說話，直到昨天離開醫院的時候，他才鼓着勇氣授給她一個紙條，紙條上寫着這麼二句：</p>
<p>「我愛你！我不能離開你！明天下午三點鐘，請你到我家裏來。」</p>
<p>原是向茫茫的虛空裏伸出一條手去，更是茫然地等待着，他心裏沒有半點把握。想不到她竟如約而來了！這該使他何等的奮興！</p>
<p>像獲到一件渴想好久的珍寶，他從椅子裏跳起來，搖搖擺擺迎上去，抓住她的手。……</p>
<p>並坐在柳陰下，他們談起話來，她告訴他早已看出他意思，並告訴他只要能使他快樂，她願意常常來看看他，希望他的康健早日恢復。</p>
<p>陽光照在粉牆上，粉牆像喝了酒似的紅，劍光的臉孔也像喝了酒似的紅。</p>
<p>終於他把病忘記了，他又回進了以前做過的綺夢中：春天，到處是光，到處是香，紅花，紅脣，……芬芳的，熱烈的，……年青人的春天，他的春天！……</p>
<p>太奮興了！他心裏燃燒起强烈的火，他不顧一切的摟住了她，他要吻她！</p>
<p>然而正當她在作一點微小的掙扎時，他的手鬆下了，他的臉孔痛苦的一皺，鮮血便像潮湧一般從他的嘴裏直　出來！——</p>
<p>半個月前的事，完全像昨天的事，他記得很清楚：鮮紅的血泊泊地湧着湧着，她嚇得大呌起來，他的父母和家人趕到園裏園，於是又手忙脚亂將他送進了醫院，他記得更清楚：當他重進醫院的第一夜，她坐在他床邊二小時，僅說了一句話：「是我害了你，我不應該來看你！」他又記得：從那一天起，她便不再來服侍他，也不大來看他，只有每天清晨來一會兒，很客氣的問一聲：「今天好嗎？」便走了。</p>
<p>現在，她站在他床前，又客氣地問他道：「沈先生，今天好嗎？」</p>
<p>劍光張開眼睛，一滴淚珠滾到枕頭上，沒有回答，只微微點了點頭。</p>
<p>她有些感動，溫柔地道：「何醫生說你的病一定會好，不過你必需清心寡慾！」</p>
<p>清心寡慾！劍光的心往下一沉，又滾出了一滴淚珠。</p>
<p>李鶯悄悄地向外走了，輕緩的脚步，甜悠的髪香，春天是她的，她很快樂，在走廊裏遇見了年輕的何醫生，她不好意思地低下了頭。</p>
<p>「Darling！」何醫生看看四面沒有人，上前捏住她的手，親　地埋怨着：「怎麼你還要去看那傢伙？」（未完）</p>
<p>還鄉　路寒作</p>
<h3>上海美術工作的起步</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>今年美術節—三月廿五日—成立的上海美術協會，經二個月的努力，籌備了這一個勝利拳術展覽會，它的內容，是否適合我們當前的要求？是否能夠表現八年抗戰給予美術的改變？是否能够代表整個上海美術界的主要傾向？這些，我們在此不敢負責保證，也無須如此，因爲，每一個人，可以自己去體察，觀賞一番來下一個結論。可是，至少應該承認這個展覽，是上海美術工作的起步，從此以後，一定會有更多的，更切實的，更需要的美術工作展開起來。如果，協會今日只想完滿地舉辦這個展覽，而作家也只想有更好的作品的來參加這個展覽，社會人士也只在這個展覽上頭體察上海美術工作的好壞，這實在都是徒然的。</p>
<p>在這次修正小學課程標準會議之中，大家都提出當前美術師資的缺乏，因之，我們要求於上海美術協會者，爲了美術教育的推進計，計劃實施美術師資訓練是第一件重要的工作。</p>
<p>美術作品的產生，有待於理論的指示，美術作品的認識，有待於批評的建立。外來美術的介紹以及固有美術的保存和發揚，則有待研究與整理工作的展開，在此，我們實在至少應該需要一本美術雜誌，這是第二件重要的工作。</p>
<p>勝利拳術展覽會的成功與失敗，在當前上海美術工作最低要求方面，並不佔着絕對重要地地位，因爲，它是起步的工作。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　（四七）　趙清閣</h3>
<p>這麼一來張弦得意了，既在麗華身上出了氣，又打出好處來了。於是連忙改變了口吻，向墨太太說：</p>
<p>「加錢不加錢沒要緊，只是您這位小姐的脾氣非得改改不可。我這樣賣力地教她，要是她能用功好好學下去，我包險至遲明年就可以登台。但是她偏偏的忒不聽話了。」</p>
<p>「謝謝您，師父！您放心得了，我一定再教訓教訓她，叫她以後聽您的話就是。」墨太太滿臉陪笑地說。心裏着實高興！爲了那個將在實現的夢幻而高興。</p>
<p>這一切，麗華都聽見了，她暗暗替自己不幸的命運叫苦！她知道她將長此沒有好日子過了，她固然恨張弦，同時也恨墨太太！她不瞭解的是：墨太太是她的生身之母，爲什麼竟忍心把她硬送給一個壞人去糟踐，去凌辱？如果說是爲着她好，但明明她是在受着最殘酷的刑罰！如果說她有罪，但她還只是一個九歲的孩子哩，噢，她是無辜的！她沒有理由要這般被毒打，這般被蹂躪在冰天凍地的嚴冬裏！可是她有什麼辦法？她沒有力量反抗！墨太太教她服從，服從便是孝順！她只有永遠把眼淚往肚子裏流，也就是她的命運！</p>
<p>麗華終於病了，好幾天不能够起床，墨太太急得請了很多有名大夫替她診治。不爲別的，爲了希望她早點痊癒，再繼續學戲。自然，也爲了她是她的女兒。就在這兩個原因之下，麗華是生又不易，死又不能！悲哀，與日俱增地在她的心靈裏成長！她茫然地覺得，自己已經不是一個人了，是一個物件，是一只貓狗！她的生，固然操縱在別人的手裏；她的死也同樣操縱在別人的手裏！別人可以任意把她怎麼處置，別人也可以任意宰殺她！</p>
<p>「這些，這些，您都知道嗎？爸爸！」</p>
<p>在最痛苦的時候，麗華便低聲這樣問着夜的太空，她向太空伸出求援的手。</p>
<p>但，夜是黑暗的！黑暗裏沒有正義，沒有公理！</p>

<h3>洋米已到·糧價步跌　米市漸入正軌　白粳昨已五萬進關</h3>
<p>昨日米市銷路仍懈，人心更見軟化，市塲成交極稀，粳秈米均跌三四千元不一國，羊秈白元無正式做開，麵粉繼續下挫八九百元，麩皮再小一二百元，黃豆汴省來貨蟬聯，去化平平，步跌千元，豆餅依然供多於求，再降四五百元，油市貨湧銷細，步削一二千元，新蠶豆到源仍旺，中下貨纘小一二千元，小麥苞米平平，新元麥乏交未開，紅糧續小千元，生仁貨少尙挺，平價麵粉每斤亦减五十元，昨日本市到米，據米市塲息，計白粳等七種，共四千餘石，其種類及石數如下：白粳一八四一石，早稻五三四石，杜秈五七石，白元二三五石，薄稻一三三二石，羊秈七〇石，蕪秈九〇四石。</p>
<p>據代理糧政特派員汪達人談稱，糧食部中國糧食公司等所訂購之洋米，迄今爲止，已近三十萬噸，均係向南美洲巴西一帶所訂購，又「聯總」大會所決議運華食米，廿九萬噸，亦可　短期內運華，在洋米即將大量運到情形之下，民食前途，極可樂觀。</p>
<h3>商人採購洋米·　·中行供給外匯</h3>
<p>洋米進口貿易，不久即將大形活躍，現已有英商遠孚洋行，法商合義洋行，猶太商福順洋行，及華商人人企業公司等，辦理洋米進口貿易，向南美洲巴西以及其他各地接洽訂購洋米，據悉：由巴西運滬，每包（一石二斗米）成本連運費在內，合美金二十元左右，現中行當局對於購買洋米所需之外匯，擬予盡量供給，至訂購手續，亦極便利云。</p>
<h3>美鈔助買空氣濃厚　金價由疲轉漲</h3>
<p>炲赤昨以報載和戰問題又露光明，買氣被遇而疲，惟美鈔助買，尙易拉上，查晨開即稍微挫，開後多方陸續出籠，再告下游，十時後中行配給一八一萬，計一二七條，此後由平靜再趨怯疲，午前曾破一八〇萬大關，惟逢低維持者再來活動，午刻在一八一萬光景，午後初時尙平，後以美鈔飛俏，激動買氣，盤漲至一八五萬五，而後始平，結果較前收無甚出入，飾金十九萬六，紋銀二千二，銀元平穩，暗拆平平，息價自一角七分至一角四分。</p>
<p>外帶美鈔空氣濃厚，助買消息繼續盛傳，是以晨開後自二三三〇元，被金市帶小殊微，二三二〇元之價屹立殊久，午刻仍在原價掙扎，午後終被激動，申請美匯更爲不易，進口商爭結美鈔，一轉瞬間突起漲風，一躍百餘元，升至二四五〇元高價，而後略起回風，在二四〇〇元內徘徊，結果較前收漲起五十五元，港票平穩，買價提升少許，美匯明平暗緊，印港兩匯賣價稍高，交易則少。</p>
<h3>公債又被拉上</h3>
<p>公債昨小心翼翼，多空均在待機中，起仆範圍狹小，統丙晨開即穿越六千元大關，在六二五〇元左右活動，開後曾哄高至六三七〇元，而後始有脫手者，低價僅降至六一三〇元，仍被拉上，結果較前收上漲五百元，甲乙漲三五〇元，丁戊亦好三百元，收後喊價續高。</p>
<h3>茶市趨勢挺秀</h3>
<p>茶價不低……外銷難轉明朗邇來本街店莊，蘇州·無錫·天津等地，對於紅綠茶花色，紛來吸取，改交易尙形熱鬧，價格亦鋒芒異常，前途漲風或有擴展之勢，至於洋莊茶市，專銷菲洲摩洛哥之珍眉及針眉兩檔綠茶，彼地尙見青睞，但新貨俱未製就，因此洋行方面擇品質優良之陳茶，聊以應需，惟持者扳售下鬆，是以趨勢續秀，此外祁門紅茶，據產區消息，新貨業已上市，惜在一切繳用高漲下，乃成本亦屬不龐，每担至少須二十餘萬元，若照國外意思，在十二三萬元間，尙有胃口，而日前抵滬之白琳新紅茶，怡和洋行雖有談判，然每担衹步出八萬元，奈客方成本亦達十萬元外，成交與否，尙難卜定。</p>
<h3>證交開業聲中　股票買氣大盛</h3>
<p>華股昨買氣仍被冷門股所激動，大中華火柴信和內衣新亞中法最受擁戴，惟因中途暴漲過甚，高價後都告回落，永紗高價六一〇〇元，低價五八三〇元，美亞高價四五五〇元，低價四三三〇元，景福高價三三七元，低價三〇三元，近午都呈盤局，結果永紗美亞續被帶好少許，景福新光勤興漲半成至一成不等，冷門中小型除榮豐未見振作外，大致再漲半成至二成不等，元老股亦被大宗買戶垂青，亦升上成至二成不等，午後喊價續有扳高，外股續被推動，怡紗上塲曾哄高至一三二〇〇元左右，而後始有浮多了結，回小至一二五〇〇元，怡啤自二九〇〇元，業廣自四三〇〇元，亞洲自二一〇〇元起，亦均告挫落，結果校前收計怡紗亞洲英聯會德豐均稍上升，怡啤鋼業紙業業廣各漲一成左右。</p>
<h3>化粧品等進口　非經中行核准　不得供給外匯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃以外傳中央銀行，對若干種進口貨品，將停止結匯之訊，特趨訪中央銀行外匯審核處長林維英氏，據告：中央銀行因鑒於近來化粧品水菓等類之進口數量，已相當可觀，故已通知各經營外匯之指定銀行，自五月廿八日起，如進出口商申請結購是項進口物品之外匯者，應事先經由中央銀行核准許可，始准照結，否則不予供給。聞該項進口物品，包括：（一）化粧品，剃鬚肥皂，面膏，牙膏，爽身粉，頭水，以及包括口，齒，頭，各部門之用品。（二）新鮮水菓。（三）膠質成品。（四）罐頭食品。（五）自來水筆。（六）廁所用具等項。</p>
<h3>天津實行限價　指定電料等十項</h3>
<p>天津市社會局以近來一般物價，日趨高漲，對於限價議價，亟應嚴格執行，期收實效，所有電料，茶葉，洗染，百貨，理髮，箔類等十業，業經公議之價格，有無陽奉陰違情事，已函知警局，隨時派員撿查，倘有故違，或任意高抬物價，即行拘案法辦。</p>
<h3>精鹽初次到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局海浙輪，昨日自津返滬，除運來瓜子棗子胡桃等北貨外，另有精鹽五千包，係久大精鹽公司報裝，精鹽進口，戰後尙爲第一次，又前日到滬蔡鍔輪由連雲港運來食鹽一千六百噸，該鹽聞須轉船運漢。</p>
<p>又太古公司北海輪今日南駛，有枕木一萬八千根運往香港，該枕木係廣九鐵路應用。</p>
<h3>呢羢行情紊亂</h3>
<p>呢羢市面，近來絕乏標準行情，因貨底異常軋缺，賣買悉多零碎，尤以高峯中之夏貨類，交易以先發動與否爲轉移，即買方如有搜求，賣方即高抬售價，反之，賣方需款，如欲售出，買方即謂實銷不振，價雖削低若干，亦難脫手，總之目今售價之榮辱，完全依靠機會也，尙有證，即甲號開價，每疋如爲五萬五千元，乙號即喊六萬元，六萬元沽出十餘碼，丙號即開六萬二三千元，倘有二三套售出，則丁號又欲開價六萬五六千元矣，同業中受高利貸影響而倒閉者，有國泰惠昌等數家。</p>
<h3>紗價一致下瀉　·花布市况均帶平庸</h3>
<p>昨日紗市疲莫能興，業馬等大型紗一瀉四萬，成效事寡，其餘廿支什牌亦跟小三四萬元，四十二支跌勢尤慘，狂跌十三萬之巨，卅二支細紗亦落七八萬，趨勢似仍脆弱，人心亦殊不振，</p>
<p>布市因實際交易稍滯，人心轉疲，浮多出籠，是以情况較爲軟化，各檔棉布跌二百五十元至千元，惟十二磅彩球細布，津幫仍有需要，獨升五百元，但午後聞蜀晋皖北一帶對於嗶嘰等布吸胃良好，市價較上午回昂五百元，昨日紐約美棉電　報跌二至十六磅當，計近期美金二八·二六，遠期一八·六三，米特林現貨二八·八八，本埠現棉市况平庸，惟交易較爲進展，如民營紗廠實豐麗生嘉豐振新等廠均有採辦</p>
<h3>燃料交易清稀</h3>
<p>據煤業公會消息，該會所屬市塲，邇日同業交易至爲滯呆，其中尤以煤球一項爲最，各檔貨非但供應量充斥，且乏去化，一般零星買戶，大都嫌價高，胃保不納，烟煤市况提前好，白煤因時令關係，乏人問津，燃料前途，一致看疲，又據柴炭業消息，晚近由蘇浙各地運滬柴炭，數量可觀，每日到貨平均約在四五千担左右，來價至爲低廉云。</p>
<h3>存款準備金　平津議繳代用品</h3>
<p>〔天津訊〕財政部制定之管理銀行法業已頒發到津，據津市銀行公會理事長陳立侯談：依銀行界通常情形，存款須留半數應付提取，其餘半數週轉流通，如再提出百分之廿作爲準備金，則流通籌碼僅有百分之卅，殊有週轉不靈之危險，平津各銀行公會擬將實際困難情形，向當局陳述，並建議準備金不繳法幣，改以有價證券或其他有價物品代替，庶使流通資金不致減少。</p>
<h3>陳貨腸衣出口　不合標準被退回</h3>
<p>我國出口腸衣，因受國外限價影響，致出口不多，更有一批小四桶，因不夠標準而退回。茲據腸衣業中息：該批退回腸衣，係某洋行所輸出者，因係陳貨，故不合標準，且退回之時，該洋行業經停業云。</p>
<h3>松香走銷不旺　牛油產地報漲</h3>
<p>內地松香年來因禁止出口，故存底頗厚，近以產地源源出運，走銷不旺，滬市生松香現價爲每市担二萬左右，大批出售尙難運到，蓋生松香用途頗少，必須製成熟松香後，方可作爲工業原料，現產地價格每担只須一萬餘元，加以轉　運輸每担到滬至少亦須一萬餘元，故內地販運松香來滬者莫不大購其本。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕滬地各皂廠現向產地搜購大量牛油，故產地牛油價格，干霄直上，因之滬地亦望風跟進，滬市價格最好者，每担已達八萬餘元，但實際上椰油源源到達，價與牛油相等，故牛油漲風或係一時現象。</p>
<h3>燒碱高價猛漲　一時不易下跌</h3>
<p>昨日燒碱因受本埠各染織廠大最搜購，兼各方謠言紛紛，各行號把持現貨，不肯脫手，以致週內價由三十萬猛竄至五十萬，最近人心看好，恐一時不易下跌，據某洋行訊，純碱有派貨，硫化碱到埠甚多，價稍挫。</p>
<h3>中美合辦　大規模電工廠</h3>
<p>資源委員會中央電工器材廠，以內部原有設備不敷應用，戰後在滬所接收之日人電工廠，亦設備簡陋，該廠總經理輝蔭堂特於本年四月底由滬赴美向美國洽購電工機器及各項電工原料，並聘請技術人員來華協助建設，現該廠正與美國規模甚大之電工廠合作，已訂立合同，來華建立大規模之電工器材廠，今後我國各項電工器材，當可大量製造，無需仰求於人。</p>
<h3>世界紡織情形轉變　各國需要棉織物品甚亟　給予美國向外發展機會</h3>
<p>〔路透社新奧利安六日電〕美國紡織業出口協會主席潑朗茲在「南方紡織新聞」中撰文稱：世界市塲需要棉織品至少四十五萬萬碼，而一九四五年流入世界市塲者僅二十五萬萬碼，世界紡織情形在最近數年來，曾起顯著變化，已往日本爲重要棉織品輸出國，在珍珠港事件前，共有紡錘一千二百萬錠，而現僅剩三百萬錠，一九三七年世界棉織品之總輸出額約六十五萬萬碼，其中日本佔三分之一以上，聯合王國佔十八萬萬碼，歐陸各國佔十二萬萬碼，一九三七年美國出口之棉織品約二萬萬碼，在最近將來，聯合王國，印度或日本尙無恢復輸出希望，是故美國在國外發展棉織品市塲，實爲空前良好之機會</p>
<h3>綢貨繼續上漲　廠經交易尙佳</h3>
<p>昨日一二〇號大橋有光現貨，上午最大喊一百三十二萬元，最小一百廿九·三十萬元，下午無變化，雜牌俱短，美女小二萬元，旭暉小一萬元，一五〇號有光小二三萬元，中紡公司開貨價，與上週四價相仿，廠絲高勻度洋行需求甚股，但乏貨供應，用戶絲及干經價，近數日來頗穩持，交易尙稱不惡，綢貨昨市又好，美亞被面每百條上午做價一百念九萬元，下午喊價三十萬元，並無成交，大誠格子璧縐每碼上午做價四千四百七十元，下午隔日期做四千六百五十元。</p>

<h3>彗星閃亮了陰鬱的一角　主席夫婦在東北</h3>
<p>瀋陽，現正當初夏的季節，嫩綠的枝葉，顯得特別靑翠可愛，它遮掩了大部份的破壞和殘缺，同時也給人們一些安慰和生機。</p>
<p>一塲雨，息滅了風沙，冲消了市街上的塵土，在風沙裏過了一個春天，甚至延長到初夏的長長日子的人們，是有特別淸新美滿之感的；這在過慣「風和日麗」「春光明媚」的江南人看來，那眞是平常的事，但在這裏是難能可貴的。</p>
<p>天氣佈置了這樣的好環境，東北的人們，意曾到這是預兆着將有非常人物的來臨，果然一架「美齡號」飛機，載來了主席，蔣夫人和新任國防部長白崇禧諸氏，這是五月廿三日下午四時的事。</p>
<p>滿淸以前，我國元首幸臨東北，幾乎是沒有，所以這次　主席和夫人的降臨，是中國歷史東北篇上値得大書特書的，何况今大柬北民衆，翹盼主席惠臨，實有「大旱之望雲霓」的情形呢！</p>
<h3>國寶名勝同光</h3>
<p>這是東北國土重光後的一件大事，一般人知道主席來了，都注意街上的動靜，他們除了在某些一地方覺察到有些戒備外，幷沒有「凈街」的塲面，同時多數的人，都看到　主席同着陪伴人員的幾輛小汽車，駛進了馬車隊伍裏，有時擦過了人叢，這種坦然磊落的風度和心胸，給東北人民留下了很好的印象！</p>
<p>城裏大東和大西城門之間，是淸朝宮殿所在地，建築于淸太宗「崇德」年間，距今已經三百一十多年了，褪了色的樓閣亭台，還在支撑着當年氣勢，大淸門裏，分成了中東西三個部份，東面是「大政殿」，一般人稱爲「十王亭」，是淸太宗和諸王議政的地方，中間是「崇政殿」，是聽政處所，後面有寢宮，西面是有名的「文溯閣」了。</p>
<p>「文溯閣」，是淸朝爲藏四庫全書「內廷四閣」之一，從乾隆四十八年貯四庫全書一份起，六十多年來，歷經遷移，變亂，抄補，九·一八事變後，日人曾擬兩次掠往東京，終因地方人士力爭作罷，民國廿四年，得僞滿文敎部的撥發鉅款，重建二層樓房新書庫，頗合現代藏書庫規定。會籌委會律陳榮禮並瀋陽婦女界等有關人士，商討推進東北婦女及兒童福利工作，對於計劃中利用舊日本領事館職員宿舍，創辦幼稚園和托兒所，頗願贊助，該處庭園廣大，環境優良，極合兒童遊息，惜房屋多遭破壞，需大加修葺，將來開辦後，或能略慰瀋陽人士過去對於日本兒童享　良好敎養，欽佩羨慕的心情，但　一般當地人士，居住地點，均遠離和平區域，將來子女能否有受敎養機會，是値得硏究的一個間題。</p>
<h3>茶會情趣橫溢</h3>
<p>瀋陽市政府大禮堂裏，廿七日下午四時的一個茶會，規模是相當大的，這是主席和夫人會併舉行招待瀋陽各界人士以及外賓的茶會，到有外國領事，敎士，名流，盟國軍人，常地士紳，文武官員，新聞記者，約計二百餘人，濟濟一堂，情感交流，極靜肅協調。</p>
<p>主席夫婦四時一刻到塲，全體起立，鼓掌歡迎，蔣夫人前行就坐，主席笑容可掬，頻頻點首答體，並連聲：「大家請坐」，繼就近旁側的于斌主敎和外賓等略行寒喧，旋同進茶點，主席有時和座旁熊主任略談數語，蔣夫人則與鄰座白副總長輕話。</p>
<p>經過了一個短暫的時間，主席于掌聲中起立，以沉痛語氣，作五分鐘簡短的演說，主席說：「東北同胞受了十四年悠久的壓迫和痛苦，政府沒能早來拯救，感到莫大遺憾，在這十四年中，本人心中很難過，同時也不安」。</p>
<p>「今天，唯有大家勉勵，不忘過去苦痛，負起責任來，共同努力來建設東北，建設勝利後三民主義新中國，自勉，勉人！」　在同盟國裏的美，蘇，英等國，都來帮助我們，我們一方感激，一方深感遺憾，那就是我們沒負起責任和任務，今後當各努力來完成我們應負的任務」！</p>
<p>士紳張子文等，致歡迎詞，要求早日恢復可用工廠，改善敎育，救濟靑年，並改瀋陽爲一特別市，主席均首肯採納急辦，張等講過去所受痛苦時，聲淚俱下，最後謂東北人民今後必以血汗來報效祖國，使東北成祖國一個堅强門戶，主席及夫人等，均大受感動。</p>
<p>會後，靑年軍二零七師四維兒童劇團，獻化，唱歌，幷演劇助興，六時許會畢，主席出市府時，門外有恭候已久的，多數民衆，爭欲一睹主席夫婦豐采，主席夫婦乃登市府二樓平台，接受歡呼，幷頻向市民揮手，市民又報之以掌聲，雙方都含着無限辛酸和興奮！</p>
<h3>雨過天晴話長沙　本報廿五日通訊　特派員高元禮</h3>
<p>風雨侵襲着長沙，好在還不是狂風暴雨，因此，人們心情比較開朗些，第一是農利正需要的是雨水，這一來普遍霑足，預測秋收的前途是比較有希望的。幾月來，天犬爲人們所憂慮的糧荒，可能因此而减輕些，其次是河水大漲，航運暢通，米源不斷，長沙的米價不斷的下跌，平民又得苟延殘喘，但不幸的是救濟分署運麥粉的船，在河下被風打沉一隻，好在損失還不大。</p>
<h3>省參議會費用超過十萬萬元</h3>
<p>雨過天晴，一切都覺得有生氣政治也不例外。就拿長沙市政府來說罷：成立半年，沒做一事，新市長汪浩接事後，　精圖治，自先以全力來淸除市內二十萬立方尺的垃圾，自然首先　到　的問題，要政府出，當然不可能，於是發動全市市民勞動服務，不服務的以二千五百元一天的，代價　工代做，預計三個月內全部出淸，這到是一椿德政。　季來臨，疫疾也許會好一些。</p>
<p>省參議會也在這期間舉行第一届會議，這是第一次民意的議會，在白熱化競爭下選舉出來的省參議員，計有七十八位，除了祁陽的劉興未來，共到七十七位，洋洋大觀，濟濟一堂。開會後選舉議長副議長亦達到白熱化的程度。歷來担任臨時參議會議長的趙炎午先生，和現任省黨部主任委員張星舫競爭，結果還是趙炎老獲得錦標。副議長則落到唐伯球先生身上，唐是湖南紡織業鉅子，現任湘南第一紡織廠長，是這次參議員裏面最使人矚目的一位。參議會會期兩週，討論的提案計有二百多件，包羅萬象，甚至還討論到各縣市路名的問題，是縣參議員張本清說，所有路名只須以先賢時賢的名字來命名，如國父爲先賢，主席是時賢，所以如伯陵路伯陵橋之類，應該取消。其他的提案內容，大約不外針對目前省政，但缺乏統一性和創造性，而爲本縣爭取救濟的提案，倒是每位參議員都提得有，救濟分署署長余籍傳昨天對記者說：「每縣都要救濟，到底給那一縣好，我請他們提出其體辦法來，可是也提不出」。參議員口口聲聲的說，是代表人民說話，但在這届參議會多少是拿救災問題，當做政治資本，好像不提請政府救濟的提案，就對不起那些選民。有人統計這次省參議員在各縣選舉的費用，和這次開會的費用，總計超過十萬萬元，（其中僅旅費一項，就有四千五百萬元。）若全數用來救濟災民，不無少補，因爲中央發給湖南的緊急農貸也不過十億元。</p>
<h3>認清「救死第一」傾全力辦急賑</h3>
<p>提到湘災，許多人過去提到就頭痛，自從社魯門總統代表哈里遜親自到湖南視察後，救濟物資源源　到，救濟分署工作一天天的加緊，儲運站更是日夜不休的工作。湘南各地如零陵，祁陽，較爲好轉，可是衡陽的情形，則日加嚴重，城區內有三萬人非賑不生，鄉村裏沒飯吃的竟有三十萬人。問題幷不是米價貴，或者買不到，而是無錢買。救濟分署和有政府都傾全力在辦急賑，余爲傳署長對記者說：「救死第一」。分署所有運來的糧食，全部向衡陽赶運，每人每日發半斤麥粉，另外發點罐頭之類。原來預計每人發足一月，可是運輪的關係，糧食來源還不暢達，只好每人先發半月，使受領的人數增加，以減輕死亡的數字。</p>
<p>「衡陽的災情假如能好轉，分署就準備在善後工作方面多做點事，王主席東原和余署長籍傳前天爲了善後工作問題交換了一次意見因爲余氏曾任湘省建廳長多年，對湘省建設工作知道得淸楚，所以由分署配合政府來做善後復典的工作更切實，他說：整個計劃還在計劃階段，余籍傳氏不願發表，要把急賑辦究再說，但原則是決定了的。第一，是交通和水利，余氏說，湘西佔湖南的火部份，物資也最豐富，可是交通太落後，和各方面都聯絡不起來。屬於湘西的資水沅水兩岸，都是富庶之區，而水利未興，也是阻碍發展的原因，善後工作將趨重於這方面，而不再做錦上添花的事，等到急賑工作辦完，就將着手。</p>
<h3>不僅災荒糧缺最近又鬧鹽潮</h3>
<p>但是善後工作是否能開始，還得看今年秋收情形如何而定。省府的看法認爲秋收是一同事，廣泛運糧來湘，又是一回事。等待今年豐收，不但不楚辦法，而且也渺茫，又請准中央增撥採購軍糧款卅億元，這筆錢將在省外購糧運來，一方面作預儲的軍糧，又可作平抑民食之用。再加上川贛餘糧四十萬石，那湖南糧食缺乏的現象，可爲好轉。</p>
<p>湖南除了災荒糧缺以外，最近又鬧了一次鹽潮。好在問題不大，不久就平息。事情是這樣的：鹽務當局因爲戰爭期中，川鹽供後方軍民食用，產量增大，銷塲增加，湖南原是淮岸，可是戰時淮鹽來源斷絕，於是改由川岸接濟。戰事結束後，准鹽源源而來，人民久已不食淮鹽，皆爭相購食，無形中川鹽滯銷，但川鹽是由政府貸款給鹽商買來的，假如無人食用，不但政府要賠本，而且影響到四川鹽區的生產，於是規定湘區每日應配銷川鑒若干担，但老百姓不願意，說川鹽鹽質沒有淮鹽好，拒絕食用。鹽務當局相當爲難，而且受到興論的批評。後來經過各方的解說，證明，川鹽淮鹽都是一樣，而且都經政府檢騐過，鹽質毫無問題，並附帶給予鹽商一個便利，規定凡向官倉購川鹽五十祖以上，所有全部稅價，准予徼具銀行承兌匯票，或銀行保付期票，到期兌款，由於鹽務當局的讓步，總算解決。</p>

<h3>關於中美醫院</h3>
<p>主筆先生：木市白克路寳隆醫院，係前　人所創辦。勝利以後，因德僑停止活動，故即停辦。嗣後盟邦美軍當局，鑒於本市貧病者多，而現有醫院殊感不能容納，故建議我國當局籌設中美醫院。原與中美合作社同辦，現歸軍事委員會管理。該院之全部最新設備，俱由美方供給，即一床一毯之徵亦然，而人事方面則由國人擔任。爲防止流弊計，院內醫師，本擬全部專任。後因人才難求，故各科主任即改爲兼任性質。由前中國紅十字會第一醫院院長（僞府時期）樂文韶爲醫務主任，故所聘各科主任，幾全部爲前紅會醫院　人。原定於六月一日開幕，現以佈置不及，或將稍暹。惟該院內情，據華者所知，有下列數點，有供該院主管當局及社會人士硏討之必要：</p>
<p>（一）按上海各大公立醫院，如紅會，同仁，仁濟等院，其各級病床之分配比例，三等至少佔全部床位百分之六十以上。良以社會人士，貧苦者多，即此冬數三等床位，尚每日客滿，欲求共一，猶十分困難。而中美醫院內定三等床位，僅佔全部床位百分之二十，是則大有背乎盟邦當局熱誠救濟吾貧病同胞之初旨矣！</p>
<p>（二）該院雖尙未開診，而各科主任醫師因利用其兼任之地位關係，已在醫院附近之××藥廠內組織一聯合診所，Polb　Cnic。由內科樂文韶，外科任廷桂，邵幼善，眼科周誠滸肺癆科方侃耳鼻科穆瑞芬等合組；其意無非効以前寳隆醫院醫師故智，就近延攬醫院之有錢病家（此所以白克路成都路一帶之醫生觸目皆是）至其私人診所而已。故該院預定三等床位之少，其用意亦由此可知！</p>
<p>（三）該院現在積極佈置中，由盟方助來之內部設備精旣多且，現雖尙未實際應用，而不翼而飛之走漏，已頗多發生矣！　由是而觀，吾盟邦援我之意及吾當局主辦之原意固善，惜以主持醫務人員之私利觀念，（院長聞係外行）實際上海貧病市民將來所得實惠究屬幾何，殊成疑問。王　蓀，五月卅日。</p>
<h3>發刊詞</h3>
<p>— 上醫社同人</p>
<p>過去十年間，科學醫較前更廣泛地被社會接受了。早先僅爲少數知識分子所認識所享受的科學醫，現在已漸漸深入大衆。這種進步，一方面展開了民族健康的曙光，一方面也給予我們這羣醫衛工作者以很大的鼓勵。</p>
<p>在工作經騐中，我們感到，在我們醫衛工作者與我們所服務的社會中間，還需要更多的了解與合作，才能達到我們共同的目的——撲滅疾病，增進人類健康的幸福。在此，我們可以把自己的立塲，稍加說明。</p>
<p>（一）一般人要到主病才找醫師，甚且病重時才找醫師。但是現代醫學的目標，卻不限於狹義的「治療」，而着重防病於未發之先，以享受健康的幸福。這就是所謂「預防醫學」。我們醫衛工作者最高的理想，即在如何使各種疾病消滅。預防醫學之實行，是公共衛生工作，僅靠醫師固不够，僅靠公共衛生人員也不够，最重要卻在全民的合作，如何獲得這種最重要的合作，是我們所要努力追求的。</p>
<p>（二）科學醫在國內雖已有數十年的歷史，但由於文化的落後，舊醫以及乞靈於神仙鬼怪的巫醫，仍塲所在皆是。雖然在相當時間之後，這些現象自會消滅，但目前寃枉死的太多，損失太大，所以在搶劫科學醫學之外，我們也要帮著大衆來破除迷信與玄說</p>
<p>由於上述的立場，我們來開闢這欄特刊。在這裏我們並不介紹某某醫師治某種病，或是介紹某種病應購服某種出品的某種藥。這都不是我們的事。我們要逐次介紹科學醫的概念，及著有成效的預防疾病和保持健康的方法。</p>
<p>在我們神聖的使命下，我們要盡力為人類健康奮鬥。這一欄特刊，是我們和社會大眾的一道橋樑。篇幅雖小，願望則宏。深盼同道加入，各界指導，則同人幸甚，社會幸甚。</p>
<h3>霍亂之病原</h3>
<p>— 楊叔雅</p>
<p>眞性霍亂是一種急性腸胃傳染病，其發源地本爲印度之恒河三角洲，自一八一七年起，藉海陸交通而傳佈全球。當時之醫學界，均不知其病原菌為何。迨至一八八三年，德國政府組織之研究會會長郭霍氏（Robert　Kock），赴埃及印度實地調査，親自檢査多數霍亂病人之糞便，並解剖患此病死亡者之腸管，在顯微鏡下，均發現一種特異之弧形細菌，經嚴密之科學實騐，證明其爲霍亂之病原菌，遂命名爲霍亂弧菌。其後，歷經各國細菌學家研究，亦證實郭霍氏之發現爲不謬，</p>
<p>査霍亂弧菌之爲物，其體甚小（僅1.5×3　），非顯微鏡不能窺。但在人體內，繁殖極速，且產生毒素，輒引致嚴重之病症——霍亂。霍亂病人，由於上吐下瀉，遂將此菌播散於外界。糞便及嘔吐物，固含有此菌，其所汚染之水，食物，蒼蠅等，亦皆可有其蹤跡。徒以形體微小，人莫之見，不知防備。其為害人類，更勝於毒蛇猛獸也。</p>
<p>霍亂弧菌固甚凶惡，但不能耐熱。一切飲食中所含之病菌，如予以煮沸，即吿殺減矣。又化學藥品，如石灰乳漂白粉等，亦能殺滅此菌，故可用以消毒糞便及嘔吐物焉。</p>
<h3>霍亂之症狀</h3>
<p>— 戴自英</p>
<p>自染有霍亂病菌之飲食人口，以至症狀發生，為期甚暫，凡數小時至五六日不等，是爲潛伏期。其症狀在流行期內，因個人之抵抗力及病菌之多寡各異與胃液之酸性及作川有別，而輕重不一；輕如輕度泄瀉，偶有嘔吐及輕微之虛脫狀態，不一二日而痊瘉，重則如乾性霍亂，於發病後數小時內，泄瀉嘔吐尙未發生以前，已因嚴重毒性現象而死亡，至普通一般症狀，大致可分三期言之。</p>
<p>（一）初　期，或有或無，儿病症較輕者每有一二是日之輕徽泄瀉，問以嘔吐，腹疼，頭痛及精神萎靡等症狀，大便爲黃色之糞液</p>
<p>（二）脫期，爲一時約二三小時至二十四小時，該期火症狀一言以蔽之，乃體內脫水有以致之。在此期內，泄瀉次數驟增，繼以頻繁之嘔吐，一小時內，可多至數十次，病人眼球深陷，頰肉下削，鼻樑高聳，嗓音暗啞，呼吸短促，口唇乾枯，脈速亦弱，皮靑且冷，腿肌牽痙，指端縐縮，些一者俗稱吊脚痧及癟瘰痧，非有別於普通霍亂，實乃脫水現象之較深者，尿量極度减少或竟全無，皮膚失固有之彈性，若以兩指捏手背之皮膚，使之上舉，常人之皮膚於鬆後即復原狀，患者則不然，久舉而緩復，病人於此期內，或因病狀轉惡入昏迷狀態而死亡或轉佳而入反願期，如無適當之治療死亡率約爲百分之四十强，在虛脫期內，大便呈特有之米干水狀或爲灰白色之沉澱。蓋其中已無糞便純由蛋白質，黏液，霍亂細菌，及上皮細菌而組成。</p>
<p>（三）反應期，約半數以上病人進人此期，在此期內大便及嘔吐頻數銳減，甚或有便秘者。皮膚自靑紫轉紅潤，嗓音亦由暗啞而宏亮。體溫上升，呼吸心臟，漸趨常態，無復有肌肉牽痙，指端縐縮姊之現象。然最重要者厥爲腎臟功用之恢復俾尿之排洩，重納正軌，如是則健康指日可待，不然，則病人重蹈危境，入類似傷寒之狀態，因尿毒症昏迷而死亡焉（尿毒症之死亡率的佔百分之十五）。</p>
<h3>霍亂發生後病家應有之處置</h3>
<p>— 王霖生</p>
<p>（一）立刻護送患者至就近之霍亂醫院或防疫醫院診治，蓋治療此病必須速行鹽水靜脈注射，以補足體內之水份而冲淡病菌之毒素。患者之性命，於此千鈞一髮之際，不可試用丹方成藥以自誤。</p>
<p>（二）患者之排泄物（包括糞便及嘔吐物等）及其衣物，咸有霍亂菌之附着，爲傳染霍亂之大害，應迅予嚴密之消毒，以防惹起新病案。患者所住之屋及床，亦應用石灰水洗灑之，以遏制其傳搖。洗　者自己須謹愼將事，以防權染此病，切勿納手指於；中。</p>
<p>（三）蒼蠅爲傳播霍亂之媒介之一，應予撲滅，最好用可靠之DDT溶液噴殺之，尤應消滅其繁殖處。食物應加以保護，勿使　可。</p>
<p>（四）設家人不幸因霍亂而死亡，其屍體當繼以二十倍石炭酸溶液所浸之麻布，而納人密閉之棺，葬　從簡，禁衆送殯。能用火葬最佳。</p>
<p>（五）霍亂旣爲病從口人，生水，不潔之水菓，生菜，皆不可隨便食用，飯前必須洗手，牛飲曇食，亦是誘致本病之傳染，不可不愼。</p>
<p>（六）遇有可疑之病人，應立即送醫院診治隔離，以免胎誤自己或傳染他人，利人利已，何樂不爲。</p>
<p>（七）家人有尙未打預防針者，應從速赴醫藥衛生權關，施行預防注射。</p>
<h3>鹽水針以及霍亂的其他治療</h3>
<p>— 張昌紹</p>
<p>對於霍亂，最要緊的治療是打鹽水針。當然，有的醫生還喜歡打種種名貴的針藥，如什麽强心針之類，價格自然很貴，倒不一定必要。最新的方法，也採用磺胺類藥物，但若不打鹽水針而專用磺胺類藥物，不僅無益，且反有害。所以，在霍亂的一切治療方法中，鹽水針是最要緊而最不可少的</p>
<p>大家知道血是身體裏最寳貴的東西，身體裏每一個細胞所需的養料，都得直接的或間接的靠血來供應；細胞所不要的廢料，也得靠血來收集與排除。但是血必須是流動的液體，才能循環全身而發揮他的功能。霍亂病人上吐下瀉，身體裏損失很多水分，因此血變粘厚，循環失靈，霍亂病人最危險的病象即田此發生。少數霍亂病人雖不吐瀉，血內水分流入組織內，亦能發生同樣結果。此種「脫水」現象是霍亂最重要病理現象，亦是霍亂致死的主要原因，在治療上必須立刻加以糾正。打鑒水針是目前所知的唯一有效方法。</p>
<p>將鹽水注入靜脈後，而內所失水分得以補充，恢復其正常之流動性，而循環隨以復元。於是霍亂病的許多症象，如癟瘰，抽筋，失音，虛脫等垂死現象，均迅速消失；但是吐瀉有時仍不停止。若吐瀉不停，則水分仍繼續損失，所以每隔數小時仍須繼續注射鹽水，至不再大量損失水分爲度。</p>
<p>但是打鹽水針並不是一件容易的手術。鹽水的配製必須根據最近學理，採用嚴格技術，吾則打針後會發生種種反應，此種反應有時足以危及生命。鹽冰加注射亦需具有良好訓練的人員施行，俾注射速率與份量無過與不及之弊。</p>
<p>最近發現普通水中含有一種致熱質，英文稱Progen,甚至蒸溜水，化學品及普通玻璃器皿亦多含此質。鹽水與其他針藥中如含有此質，則靜脈注射後往往發生發冷發熱頭痛嘔吐等種種反應，有時足以危及生命。普通的消毒方法並不能消滅此種致熱質。過去市上的蒸溜水與鹽水中均含有大量致熱質，所以打鹽水針後均發生反應，現在已發明特殊的方法，可以除去水中的致熱質，所以希望今後的藥房供給無致熱質的蒸溜水，醫院應用無致熱質的鹽水，以减少病人的痛苦及危險。</p>
<p>其次，多數霍亂病人不僅有「脫水」現象，亦有「酸中毒」所以不僅需要鹽水，亦需要鹼性成分。過去大多忽略此點，因此病人白脫水現象中得救後，往往仍死於酸中毒。鹽水中加鹼性成分，亦不簡單。重炭酸鈉自然是很好的鹼性成分，但加入後不能用普通方法消毒。如採用乳酸鈉則配製方法較爲容易。</p>
<p>前　在美國與吾國均有試用磺胺類藥物治療霍亂的報吿。採用磺胺前，必須先打鹽水針待血內水分補足而腎臟機能恢復，吾則易致嚴重反應。磺胺類之應用，似可减少霍亂之死亡率。目前所知之最佳磺胺類係磺胺　啶（Sulfaoiazine）</p>
<h3>病從口入謹防霍亂！！！</h3>
<p>— 喬樹民</p>
<p>可怕的霍亂，又名虎烈拉，今年又發現了！</p>
<p>「談虎色變」，也大可不必，我們要追究：這霍亂是怎樣來的？有什麽法子戰勝他？</p>
<p>「知己知彼，百戰白勝。」這霍亂是怎麽一回事呢？原來是由於霍亂病人（或帶菌者）的義便和嘔吐物，含有無數的霍亂弧菌；經過某種傳染途徑—水，食物，蒼蠅，手指，食具等；跑進別人的口裏，在肚子裏發作起來。於是這些人變成病人，又可傳染別人，如畏輾轉流佈，便死亡枕藉了。</p>
<p>我們旣已探明了霍亂的來踪去跡，便不患沒有對付牠的策略。策略有三：第一，「敵人從那裏來，就在那裏消滅牠。」霍亂弧菌從病人的糞便或嘔吐物而來，我們便將糞便和嘔吐物澈底消毒，勿使霍亂弧菌漏網，這是正本淸源的上策，最澈底，最有效？最緊要。用什麽法子消毒呢？最便利可靠的法子，是立刻用等量的石灰（塊灰），加進糞便或嘔吐物，攪勻後傾入深坑或埋入土中。如有漂白粉可用，較石灰尤佳。尊府或貴鄰居，有霍亂病人麽？沒有的話，請提高警覺性，密切注視。一旦有了霍亂病人，那麽，請你趕快用上法消毒糞便，消毒嘔吐物。這個基本步驟，不算太麻煩，事關自己的生命安全，幸勿馬虎。</p>
<p>但是，未見得個個病家都如是消毒，也未見得個個做得十分完密。也許霍亂弧菌，已經侵入你們的飲水了，侵入你們的食物了，附著在蒼蠅脚上了，附著在食具上了，附著在手指上了，怎麼辦呢？所以我們還要採用第二條戰略—斷牠們的傳染途徑。</p>
<p>切斷什麽途徑呢？首先是水，最爲重要，如有消毒的自來水可用，固佳，如用河水井水，則當嚴密保一護水源，愼防汚染，無論如何，絕不可喝生水，亦不可用生水洗瓜菓吃，也不可拿生水冲洗碗　或漱口。總之，喝的吃的用的，凡是進口的，都必需用煮沸的水，以策安全。</p>
<p>其次是食物，含有生水的東西，如酸梅湯，荷蘭水，凉粉之類，固不可食，就是其他的東西，也必箭熟食。蒼蠅可過的瓜片或食物，可能帶有附着的霍亂弧菌，手指頭東摸西換，也有帶菌的可能，歸根結底，要當心尊口，不讓一切可能帶有霍亂弧菌的飲食進口。常言說得好：「病從口入」。防守着這座要海，霍亂弧菌是不能從皮膚或眼耳鼻孔攻進來的。</p>
<p>倘使眞能嚴密地履行上述條款，可以高枕無憂矣。但是人類社會接觸頻繁，一般環境衛尘，又十分欠缺，在此霍亂流行期間，稍一不愼，即可罹染。所以還當採用最後一道防綫，也就是對付霍亂的第三個策略。</p>
<p>第三個策略預防注射，打防疫針，以增强我們身體抵抗霍亂弧菌的力量，所謂「免疫力」是也。意思是萬一有少許霍亂弧菌，侵入人體，打過防疫針的人體可以抵抗，有戰勝病菌免於疫病之望。不鍋世界上一切免疫力，都是比較性的，絕不能依仗着打過防疫針，就自以爲保了險。胡吃亂喝，還是）樣有危險的。</p>
<p>老實說，霍亂這種傳染病，是絕對能够防免的，在歐美文明國家，霍亂早經滅絕了。而我們中國，三年兩年流行一次，寃死之城，越發擁擠，不可謂非國家民族之奇恥大辱。</p>

<h3>榮案</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>榮德生案是用美金卅餘萬臏出來的，從昨天警察局的突下緊急命令，注意警察局所印發的美鈔號碼單，可以證實了。</p>
<p>這件事發生，我們有兩個感想：</p>
<p>第一，是榮家的不與治安當局的合作；第二，是治安當局未能秉公處理。</p>
<p>榮德生被綁以致釋放歸來，這一段期間與匪徒的來往接洽等等，都是守口如瓶，秘密行事，治安機關不但絕未從榮家獲得任何參考情報和線索，反被許多玄虛所矇混，甚至受騙而宣佈榮之脫離匪窟，係匪徒被警探所迫而自動釋放，並未出任何代價；</p>
<p>治安機關自然不願徇私，和榮家一鼻孔出氣，爲了投鼠忌器之故而不再追究，但在聞人出面講話之後，只好放松一步，並沒有對庇護匪徒的榮家依法予以處分，這是我們引以爲十分遺憾的。</p>
<p>因此，匪徒至今仍得逍遙法外。</p>
<p>倘使事情的經過，恰與上述相反哩，恐怕不僅榮案兇犯能得早日緝獲，而以後作奸犯科者也不敢輕易嘗試罷。</p>
<h3>陳逆公博姘婦　莫國康受審記</h3>
<p>— 張明</p>
<p>「漢奸而是女的，一定是妖冶過人，香艷肉感的肥肉，」每個人都這麼想。於是這首都高等法院審理的第一號女漢奸，就成了眾人嚮往的目標了。</p>
<p>她並沒有丈夫，而且沒有和人正式結過婚，但是他是漢奸陳公博的姘婦，自然，想情想理，這裏面不免就有點艷史了。</p>
<p>你想，這是一個多麼足以吸引人的題目呢？於是首都高等法院在三號那一天，像做喜事似的，門庭若市，從庭院裏到法庭裏，只看到人潮人浪。這裏面還有着一部分留在陷區的同胞，是曾經在地的淫威下忍氣吞聲過來的。今天，乘興而來，想已見她「也有這麼一天」！</p>
<p>當審判官升座後，莫逆隨着也就押了進來，自然，第一個印象，給人未免有點突兀，因爲她不但不是三頭六臂，而且也不艷麗，穿着是一件熨燙得畢挺的淡藍印丹布大褂，一雙黑色平底皮鞋，頭髮不燙，短短的，臉型很明顯的是南方調子，兩雙眸子烱烱有神，皮商稍黑，入庭時，態度鎮定極了，而且也怪自然的。</p>
<p>在開始訊問她的經歷時，首先觸到的問題，就是她和陳逆的關係，法官用各種方式訊問，却沒有一句直截了當的說：「你什麼時候起和陳逆軋姘頭？」於是她也就一直躲躲閃閃的說什麼「我們是師生關係」，「我照應他」，等等。開始問他什麼時候和陳逆相識，她很快的說：「民國十三年十五年之間，」怎麼認識的呢？「他曾爲我的老師，同時，他追隨於廖仲愷先生之後參加國民革命，隨時出入於廖氏公館，我也常至廖公館，所以認識。」於是，後來「我照應他」，「替他做點私人的事情」。總之，是很輕便的，很微妙的，莫逆就成了陳逆的姘婦了。</p>
<p>問她怎樣去附　，她說：「二十八年四月底，因爲廣州失守，家人失散，我欲歸去找家人，所以韶關到香港，住了十一個月，那個時期，我讀書宣寫文藝，是介紹前方的抗戰」。</p>
<p>爲什麼又到南京呢？她說：「是陳先生叫我來的。本來陳先生也不肯的，但是因爲汪先生一定要他去，不得已，只得去一趟，因爲我照應陳先生慣了，所以陳先生要我去，我也不得不去」。</p>
<p>「到上海是四月初，住數日即晋京，那時陳已是立法院院長了，我就進去做編修。」從二十九年十月以後，就當立法委員，一直到南京政府解散爲止」。</p>
<p>「關於政治保衛部的事實是這樣；卅四年四月到該部工作，最初是參事，後來又奉命兼在機要室服務」。問她是否代理陳逆總監的工作，她却說：「絕無其事，我大多幫忙他的私事，我不批閱公事，而且我是多病的弱女子，怎麼會做這些事呢？後來我也是爲了身體不好而離開政治保衛部」。</p>
<p>關於僞立法院通過的危害中國的中日基本條約，和中日滿共同宣言等條文，她說：「我沒有參加議會，同時，這是中政會交下來的，還指定是一個字都不能更改，所以立法院是沒有責任的。至於中日滿共同宣言，我是見了有個「滿」字就不高興了。」說得真好，似乎大家都應當相信她的謊話的。</p>
<p>審判長問她：「你知道這些條約都足使中國滅亡嗎？」她說：「我沒有研究，我也沒有表示贊同」。</p>
<p>接着又一再表示，她到東京去並不是「畏罪潛逃，」而是因爲陳逆去日本。「我是照應他慣了的，而且當時南京的情形很混亂，陳先生怕我發生危險，呌我一同去，我就去了」。</p>
<p>自然，站在被告台上發言時的莫逆，是還沒有曉得陳逆已於這一天的早上已在蘇州正法了的，所以當審判長問她：「陳公博已判了死刑，你的感想如何？」她笑起來，而且强裝得那麼毫不在乎的樣子，她說：「我的感想就是他爲朋友犧牲了。」她還是在爲陳逆辯護。</p>
<p>她是僞立法委員，而且是僞政治保衛部機要室主任，她爲政治保衛部的總監陳逆代行職權，而保衛部乃是一個特工的機構。她否認：「我沒有替陳先生辦過公事，只代他做私事。」又說：「我是看公事，不是批公事。」爲什麼要她說看呢？她說：「因爲特工和陳先生都沒有什麼關係的，所以要我進去替他看看。」始而否認不明白稽部是一特工機關的，現在又自己吐實。至末了，還呈上一件公事，是僞時代經她簽呈給陳逆的東西，說是這可以證明我並沒有「代拆代行」。</p>
<p>還有一點自白的矛盾處，即是最先說到在立法院工作，乃是爲了取得一點薪水可以維持生活，但待問到她以什麼階級支薪時，又否認：「我從沒有拿過薪水，真的，我從沒有拿過薪水。」那麼這就是說，正式支薪我是沒有親自辦，但是身爲總監的外室，取款當然是隨時方便了。</p>
<p>問她有沒有結婚，她說：「沒有結婚」。四座的人都笑了，可是她到挺認真的呢！</p>
<p>最後，她還是丑表功一番，首先，她說：「我始終守着兩個原則：一是不批評抗戰，因爲我是贊同抗戰的；一是不批評最高領袖，同時對後方派來京滬的工作同志，予以協助」。這以後，就舉出了多少例子，什麼軍統的陳琳，三戰區的吳化羣哪，反正是無從稽考的事，一筆沒來由的賬。說說總好聽些。又說什麼解除人民痛苦。</p>
<p>這一套漢奸理論，足足說了好十幾分鐘，而且連笑帶說，態度煞是「那個」。</p>
<p>對起訴書，她辯駁着幾點：（一）各種法規條約，均由中政會送來，只能通過，無權更改，尤以中日滿共同宣言，是指定不能更改一個字的。（二）所稱代行政治保衛部總監權事，陳先生從未請過假，無代理之必要，且我以一多病之身，又是一個女子，那能代行總監職務。（三）赴日本的事是因我照應陳先生多年，陳先生叫我去，我不能不去，並非畏罪潛逃。（四）與抗戰同志聯絡及解除人民痛苦諸事，都是事實。</p>
<p>「我沒有做過不利於國家，不利於人民，不利於抗戰的行爲。」</p>
<p>「爲朋友到底，」</p>
<p>而且很勉强的笑了。</p>
<p>就這樣，庭上宣告十日上午十時宣判。</p>
<h3>蛇</h3>
<p>— 鮑織英譯</p>
<p>地雷清除器</p>
<p>美國陸軍作戰部最近公佈了一種叫做「蛇」的新式武器，該種利器在歐洲戰塲上，曾被聯合國軍隊大量使用，清除了許多軸心軍所埋的地雷，使戰車部隊能毫無危險的進入敵人的陣地。</p>
<p>「蛇」是一個金屬製的狹長綫形的容器，有兩平綫狀的易爆炸的火綫閘繞在彎曲的鋁板間，用螺絲釘釘住後，可以由輕型或中型坦克車推動前進，引起地雷爆炸。該武器長四〇〇呎，闊十四吋，高五吋，重約九〇〇〇磅，但一半的載重却是烈性炸藥的重量。</p>
<p>「蛇」有一個似栔狀的鼻，裝置在前面，引導它狹長的身體通過崎嶇的道路或山地。橢圓形的特別彈藥簡是安置在狹長器內，每個相隔的距離共約二呎半，正在推進中的坦克車的機關槍火，可以使導火綫起火爆炸。</p>
<p>爲了避免競價的破壞，所以這種武器大都在夜間使用，大批在田地中活動的「蛇」，都由草木沙袋加以僞裝保護，用每小時二哩的速率向前推進。</p>

<h3>蠟燭米商　不點不亮</h3>
<p>— 馮憶</p>
<p>閙得滿城風雨的糧食貸款，牽聯之廣，範圍之在與案情之曲折歸奇，頗多不足爲外人道。</p>
<p>三泰米行經理吳蓉生現被扣押於西區某軍事機關，始終不准與家屬見面，即其家屬所送食物，亦皆須事前送醫院化驗後，始准進食。據聞原因有二，一恐與家屬見面後，防其「走路道」，「尋門徑」，「劃手脚」，以致中途發生變化。二恐食物中置毒自肖像盡，而造成「無頭公案」。</p>
<p>又聞吳蓉生曾託某聞人與米業某巨頭請求保釋，但遭拒絕。</p>
<p>此項糧貸因涉嫌而被查賬者，除米行之外，尙有多家「後台硬」「實力厚」之公司多家。某公子之公司，因多係買空賣空，故無實據可查。但長江公司證據確鑿，故有經理王巽之等三人被扣押之事。</p>
<p>常政府當局一再申述平抑糧食之決心時，米商多抱觀望態度，以爲尙可敷衍了事，迨長江公司事發後，始知此番當局之做事，已非口頭講講可比，更鑒於軍事機關亦協助進行，乃知事臨性命交關之階段，因而米商亦由懼而生畏，米價隨之自動趨跌。上海人所謂「蠟燭小開，不點不亮」，以此形容，可稱恰到好處。</p>

<p>蒙難同志會會員有被檢舉爲漢奸且經偵查確有罪嫌而提起公訴開庭鞠訊者，尹定一是也。當開審時，尹妻出蒙難同志會證書作證會員入會，資格例須審查，而檢察官之起訴，事前亦必先予偵查；這是同志會審查資格者之糊塗，還是檢察官之起訴不當且看將來。</p>

<h3>民主奶罩</h3>
<p>— 紫蘇</p>
<p>某先生盡了一張漫畫，是個半裸的小姐，胸前罩着奶罩；在奶罩上，寫了民主兩字，題是「民主小姐你在走桃花運啊！」</p>
<p>有人批評他擬於不倫，因爲民主不是「交桃花運」的小姐，也不是出賣肉體的蕩婦。</p>
<p>但在我看來，倒也頗覺耐人尋味，民以食爲天，何况在這米珠薪桂，嗷嗷待哺的當兒，嬰孩所　於爲娘的，第一當然是奶汁。雖然現在美國貨的「克寗奶粉」，遍地皆是，但奶粉總不及母奶來得好，又兼奶粉的價錢，也不甚便宜，到底要有錢人的才配享受，在窮小子們看來，卻是奢侈品，那麼對於母奶，自更翹首以待了！我們希望民主的來臨，正和嬰兒待哺一樣的迫切！</p>
<p>可憾的，民主上面却還罩着一雙奶罩，可望不可即，不知要待何日，才得有民主奶可吮，不致讓「克寗奶粉」在做市面。借用一句舊詩，這正叫做「總覺銷魂隔一層」，我們離開真民主，正還有若干距離，怎不教人對茲「倩影」，要感到「黯然」了？</p>
<p>我們不希望民主小姐交桃花運，成了私人的禁臠玩物；我們要護持她，幫她驅除狂蜂浪蝶，希望她做成一位大家的母親，讓我們大家有奶吃！（編者按：該畫係刊於「薪聞天地」月刊十一期）</p>

<p>（一）甲未與乙結婚而與丙結婚，有無犯法，是否重婚？犯何法第幾條？原文請錄示。（二）甲與乙并無解除婚約，與丙正式結婚，丙在法律上有無地位，丙是否合法？（三）如甲未與丙脫離關係，惟對乙否認有丙之事，復與乙結婚，甲是否犯重婚罪？丙可有控訴權？（四）甲不與丙脫離關係，唯對乙僅否認有丙，復與乙結婚，將來丙出現乙丙之地位關係如何？居長乎？抑丙居長乎？因乙先訂婚，應視爲原配，丙先結婚，亦可視爲優先乎？（五）男女同居若干年以上，法律上可認爲夫妻？（六）假使甲丙同居年限已到法律上所規定，已可認爲夫妻，然則乙處於何種地位？（七）現甲否認有丙，假使與乙結婚後，而丙出現，丙在法律上有何地位及權利？（八）對方有重婚行爲，被害方應於若干時限內提起控訴？在交通斷絕通訊困難期中，事實確否尙未證實之前，此種時限，是否有效？（九）乙現年事已長，且不能自立，假使甲受丙之阻，不與乙結婚，乙大受損害，訂婚久不結婚，甲有無犯法？犯何法？乙是否稱爲被遺棄？乙在法律上有何權利？可否請求賠償及贍養費等？（十）現費如何計算？是否照生活指數？（十一）甲隱瞞有與丙結婚事，願與乙結婚，乙應以何種法律手續需要辦理後，方可與甲結婚？并以何種法律手續可使丙對甲之關係無效？或使其成爲自然脫離關係，不生法律上效力？</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Issued an Order Yesterday: National Army in the Northeast to Cease Advance, Effective from Noon Today for a Period of Fifteen Days</h3>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th) The temporary agreement for a fifteen-day ceasefire, after being jointly signed by government and CCP representatives and Special Envoy Marshall, was immediately announced to various newspapers and Shanghai newspaper bureaus in Nanjing by the Central Propaganda Department at 11:00 AM on the 6th, in a lightning-like action. A press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters was held at the Central Propaganda Department, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei, who announced on the spot the ceasefire order issued by Chairman Chiang on the 6th.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency Urgent Dispatch, Nanjing, 6th) The National Government will formally announce on the 6th: "I have now ordered all our troops in the Northeast to cease all attacks, advances, and offensives, effective from noon on June 7th, for a period of fifteen days. This is to give the CCP another opportunity to truly fulfill the agreements they have previously signed. The government's adoption of this measure will not affect its right to restore sovereignty over the Northeast according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty."</p>
<p>The following points must be fully resolved within these fifteen days:</p>
<p>(1) Detailed measures for the complete cessation of conflicts in the Northeast.</p>
<p>(2) Detailed measures and a timetable for the complete restoration of domestic transportation.</p>
<p>(3) Obtaining a firm foundation for the swift implementation of the agreement of February 25th of this year regarding the demobilization, reorganization, and unified command of the national armed forces.</p>
<p>(Another Dispatch) CCP representative Zhou Enlai issued a statement in Nanjing at 4:00 PM on the 6th, expressing acceptance of Chairman Chiang's order announced on the 6th to cease military conflicts in the Northeast. However, Zhou's statement included words such as "negotiations will inevitably involve national-level political issues related to the Northeast, which will require more time," which has attracted the attention of observers here.</p>
<p>(United Press, Nanjing, 5th) Marshall, Zhou Enlai, and Xu Yongchang will soon begin fifteen days of consultations to decide the issue of peace or war in China. According to a senior general close to Chairman Chiang: The Communist side has agreed to the government's suggestion that Marshal Marshall be the supreme arbitrator for the final drafting and interpretation of the agreement.</p>
<h3>Order for Fifteen-Day Northeast Ceasefire; Ministry of National Defense Telegraphs Compliance; Lu Dingyi States Yan'an Will Also Issue Orders</h3>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th) Following the National Government Chairman's declaration of a fifteen-day ceasefire beginning at noon on the 7th, the Ministry of National Defense telegraphed the Northeast Headquarters on the morning of the 6th. Before 3:00 PM that afternoon, it further telegraphed the directors of various headquarters and Pacification Commissioner's Offices, relaying the order to all units under the various army groups for unified compliance. According to a senior official of the Ministry of National Defense: After the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, its work aspirations are to take over the entire sovereignty of the Northeast, implement the ceasefire order, and, in accordance with the military reorganization plan, streamline and reorganize the national army. The aforementioned three matters (1) are being carried out gradually, (2) have begun to be implemented from today, and (3) the reorganization of the national army is also being implemented gradually. Regarding the unified command of the Communist army, a fair military reorganization plan has already been established and can be followed. Whether true peace can be achieved in the future, and whether the country can have lasting peace and stability, depends on whether the Communist army can abide by the military reorganization plan. The ceasefire order promulgated today is a touchstone for peace. He firmly believes that the National Army's military orders are as firm as a mountain, and they will be able to comply with the ceasefire order without violation, as they have done in the past. In the future, they also plan to invite news reporters and National Assembly representatives to personally inspect various stationed areas to distinguish between sincerity and falsehood.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th) CCP representative Lu Dingyi, when answering inquiries during a press conference held at 4:00 PM on the 6th, stated: "Regarding the fifteen-day ceasefire order, we notified Yan'an on the 5th and expect the ceasefire order to be issued to the CCP troops in the Northeast on the 6th."</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Personally Drafted a Public Notice; Three Important Points Highlighted with Red Circles</h3>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th) Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei announced the National Government Chairman's public notice on the fifteen-day ceasefire in the Northeast this afternoon, first reading the English text in fluent English, and then reading the Chinese text. Peng also held a copy of the original Chinese text, which was reportedly personally drafted by the Chairman. The three important points listed in the original public notice—completely stopping the conflicts in the Northeast, fully restoring domestic transportation, and implementing the unification and reorganization of the armed forces—were circled in red pen. The entire public notice is concise, only a little over a hundred characters, but it represents the long-awaited desire of the entire nation and has become an important document in the history of the Chinese nation's national revolution and nation-building. The dozens of reporters present at the scene were greatly moved after hearing this announcement. After reading this important news in extra editions and evening newspapers, the citizens were filled with mixed feelings of sadness and joy and told each other about it, expressing their utmost respect to the Head of State, who has repeatedly used national love and sincerity to educate the CCP. They generally believe that this is the last opportunity for the government to give the CCP a chance to renew itself. They hope that the CCP will understand the Head of State's good intentions, the sincerity of the Allied nations, and faithfully fulfill its various promises to save itself, save the country, and rescue our remnants.</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department Enlivened from Its Stagnant Atmosphere; General Gillem Flies to Changchun; Negotiations on Road Repair, Reorganization, Etc. to Resume</h3>
<p>(Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th) Chairman Chiang's order for the National Army in the Northeast to cease pursuit, advance, and attack, effective at noon on the 7th, has been received here at the Military Mediation Department. The stagnant atmosphere, which had lasted for a long time, was revitalized. The CCP side held a separate meeting on the morning of the 6th for this purpose. A relevant government official stated: The order to cease offensive operations for fifteen days will not affect the National Army's work to consolidate security in the areas it has already recovered.</p>
<p>(Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th) General Gillem, the American Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department, flew to Changchun on the morning of the 6th, accompanied by staff and communications technicians. Neither the government nor the CCP sent personnel along. However, the government side has notified the military authorities in Changchun to provide proper assistance, and the CCP has ordered Rao Shushi, the CCP group leader of the Central Group currently stationed in Shenyang, to contact them nearby or go to Changchun for liaison. Gillem's mission is to arrange for the establishment of the Northeast Branch of the Military Mediation Department (the name has not yet been determined) and prepare for mediation work after the formal agreement is established. Major General Timberman, who will take over his duties, will arrive in Beiping soon.</p>
<p>(United Press, Northeast National Army Headquarters, 6th) Brigadier General Gillem flew to Changchun at noon on the 6th. According to authoritative sources: The special undeclared civil war in the Northeast is now facing the eve of a peaceful settlement. According to well-informed sources here, the Communist army has, in principle, already expressed its agreement to withdraw from Harbin without fighting. It is generally understood that Gillem's flight to Changchun to implement this extremely important agreement in principle may end the current civil war on any day or at any time. This news can also be regarded as a great diplomatic victory for General Marshall.</p>
<p>(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th) CCP Propaganda Minister Lu Dingyi, representing Zhou Enlai, told Chinese and foreign reporters at 4:30 PM on the 6th that the CCP agreed to a fifteen-day ceasefire and intends to negotiate on the following matters: (1) detailed measures to end the conflict in the Northeast, (2) an agreed-upon plan, with time limits, for the complete restoration of transportation in China, and (3) a basis for the prompt implementation of the February 25th agreement on the demobilization, reorganization, and unified command of the Chinese armed forces.</p>
<p>(United Press, Nanjing, 6th) The U.S. Embassy held a cocktail party last night to introduce the new Counselor, Butterworth, to the Chinese officialdom. During the party, Zhou Enlai drank and chatted with various government officials, and the atmosphere was very pleasant. Once the ceasefire agreement is signed, it is expected that Special Envoy Marshall will immediately begin negotiations on issues such as a permanent ceasefire, restoration of transportation, and reorganization of the Northeast army.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th) Representatives of the Democratic League to the Political Consultative Conference, Luo Longji, Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, and Zhang Bojun, as well as standing committee members of the Youth Party Li Huang and Liu Dongyan, and representative of the Social Democratic Party Mo Dehui, visited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 9:00 AM on the 6th.

<h3>Hankou Refugees Seek Relief; Dispute Arises with the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA)</h3>
<p>(Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th) Over five hundred refugees from Anhui Province stranded in Hankou were previously provided with dispersal rations and transportation by the Hubei branch of the CRRRA. However, these refugees, claiming that their hometowns are mostly in Communist-controlled areas, were unwilling to leave Hankou and return home, resulting in them wandering the streets without a livelihood. They gathered at the branch office on the past two days to demand long-term relief. The office, stating that this was beyond the scope of its relief efforts, did not approve their request, leading to a dispute between the two sides, causing disorder. The doors were locked, and office work was suspended. The refugees even snatched and ate the office's dinner. After the headquarters convened a meeting of various sectors to discuss countermeasures, it was decided to issue re-sending rations, which temporarily quelled the situation.</p>
<h3>Beiping Engineering Society Celebrates Engineers' Day</h3>

<h3>New Zoning Standards for Civil Servant Treatment Adjustments Implemented Starting This Month</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th) Various parties have attached great importance to the issue of adjusting the treatment of civil servants and teachers, and all hope that the Executive Yuan will make a reasonable adjustment this time to ensure the minimum living standards of ordinary civil servants and teachers. However, because the Executive Yuan has repeatedly insisted that the national treasury is insufficient, it cannot accept the recommendations of the Legislative Yuan and the expectations of various parties.

<h3>Guangzhou City Government Lives on Borrowed Money; Mayor Chen Ce Hosts Reporters to Report on Work</h3>
<p>(Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 6th) Mayor Chen Ce hosted reporters on the 5th to report on the city government's recent work, briefly stating: (1) Military grain procurement: The city government must bear 5,000 large bags per month recently.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in the Suburbs of Batavia Massacred Villages within a Hundred Li Reduced to Scorched Earth Our Consul Protests to the East Indies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 4th] This reporter has reliably learned from Chinese refugees who have fled here that overseas Chinese residing around the town of Tangerang, fifteen miles west of Batavia, have been brutally massacred by Indonesian terrorists. At least 700 overseas Chinese have been killed, and all Chinese-owned properties in the area have been burned to the ground.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 5th] The Chinese Consul in Batavia today protested to the Indonesian government about the massacre of six hundred Chinese in a certain area on the banks of the Tangerang River. During the conflict, large areas of villages were set on fire and burned. The Chinese Consul protested to Prime Minister Sjahrir and sought help from the Allied forces. The British High Commissioner met with Sjahrir tonight regarding this matter. Dutch troops recently occupied the area fifteen miles from Batavia. It is generally believed that the Indonesian army suspected the Chinese of collaborating with them. A spokesman for the Allied headquarters reported that another thousand Chinese were besieged in a village, resisting with knives and other weapons. It is reported that the Chinese massacred by the Indonesians included women and children. Three thousand overseas Chinese fled to the Dutch front line in Tangerang, west of Batavia. According to British eyewitnesses, the Kezhuang within a radius of one hundred square li has become a scene of rubble or is still burning. There are no British guards stationed here, but it is believed that if the situation remains out of control, an armed force can be dispatched.</p>
<p>The Allied Headquarters Sits by and Does Not Help [Special Dispatch from Central News Agency, Batavia, 5th] Jiang Jiadong, the Chinese Consul General in Batavia, who is of uneven caliber, criticized the Allied Headquarters for not adopting the suggestion to send emergency troops to Tangerang, saying, "Do the Allied authorities just sit by and watch my civilians be massacred?" At the very least, they should provide the overseas Chinese with weapons so that they can defend themselves. I have made the above suggestion to the Allied Commander-in-Chief, Montserff, who is considering it.</p>
<h3>Memorial Week Report by Chief of General Staff Chen</h3>
<p>(5) Military Demobilization This time, the cadres to be demobilized from various levels of troops number approximately two hundred thousand. They are all veterans of the Anti-Japanese War, and the government should make proper arrangements for them. However, some people who do not know the truth believe that the government's implementation of military demobilization has not yet seen a single person return to the fields. It must be understood that China's situation is different from that of Europe and the United States, and it cannot be simply completed with a demobilization order. If officers and soldiers cannot live in peace after retirement, they will not understand the country's intention to reward merit, and it will also affect social order. The Military Affairs Commission originally stipulated: (1) Individual Transition: Demobilized officers are first incorporated into the Officers' Corps. In addition to retirement and dismissal, it is planned to provide specialized training to 150,000 people and then assign them to police, transportation, management, industry and mining, agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, land administration, local administration, local health, finance, compulsory education, social labor, and other departments. Various training programs will begin separately from June. (2) Group Transition: Mainly for demobilized soldiers. In addition to retirement and dismissal, it is estimated that approximately one million people will be organized into construction corps for railways, highways, water conservancy projects, agriculture and forestry, reclamation, and mining, according to their wishes. After the completion of the project, they will be transferred to road workers, mine police, or allocated land according to the number of people. (3) Advanced Studies: Select outstanding demobilized officers and soldiers and provide them with military technical training for use in troop cadre exchanges and replacements during force reductions. (4) Among the retired and demobilized officers and soldiers, those who volunteer or whose age and physique meet the retirement and dismissal requirements, it is estimated that there are approximately 40,000 officers and 400,000 soldiers, who will be given various retirement (5) dismissal allowances and travel expenses, etc. (The above four measures have been implemented in stages). (5) Dismissal of Military and Civilian Personnel: Those who retire can be dismissed by analogy to the rank of officer, and a one-time retirement payment and travel expenses to return to their hometown will be issued according to the regulations for one-time retirement. It is planned to dismiss 30,000 military personnel this year, including 120 generals, 3,845 colonels, and 26,053 lieutenants. Regarding the demobilization of the Youth Army, the student soldiers who served in the Youth Army and other troops (Military Police, Motorized Regiments, Assault Brigades, Automotive Technology Training Classes), except for the troops stationed in the occupied areas and other important tasks, will be demobilized by the end of May this year. Those who pass the graduation examination of the Reserve Officer Education will be awarded the rank of Second Lieutenant in the Army Corps or Specialty. Those who fail will be awarded the rank of Reserve Sergeant and then demobilized (they are also allowed to stay in the camp according to their wishes). (6) Establish various military systems and strive for scientific research and development. The various military systems in the plan, and the key ones, are approximately the following: First, adopt the military region system, planning to divide the country into several military regions, each responsible for the implementation of military affairs. Second, reform and establish the military education system, so that the training of army, navy, and air force cadres and commanders is achieved under a hard-won and reasonable procedure and sound cultivation, so as to achieve the goal of assigning positions according to ability and awarding ranks according to performance. Third, the regulations for supply areas, adopting a warehouse system to facilitate in-kind supply, dividing the country into several supply areas. Fourth, the determination of organization. China's production is backward, which leads to organizational aspects often accommodating reality, and taking small steps. In the future, we should take the strengths of others, and not stop reforming. A plan has been drawn up and will be further studied in order to improve it. Fifth, implement a universal military training system, and strive to improve and promote it. As for scientific research and development, since modern national defense is the integration of all sciences, the most important thing to talk about national defense and military building is the research and development of national defense science. However, the congenital foundation of national defense science construction depends on the universal development of pure science and applied science in society before it can be expected to be successful. It is hoped that the whole country will work together to catch up with the world's most advanced standards. Finally, it should be specifically mentioned that this time, China's reform of the military system is very arduous. In addition to relying on the chairman to preside over it, and receiving guidance from the former Chief of Staff and Minister Bai, General Wedemeyer also made several earnest suggestions to the chairman before his visit to China. At the same time, the valuable opinions of Brigadier General Brink and his staff were also received, so that China's current Ministry of National Defense can be established as it is. This kind of priceless friendship is deeply appreciated here. (End of yesterday's first edition)</p>

<h3>Don't Miss the Opportunity Again!</h3>
<p>The ceasefire order in the Northeast, which Chinese and foreign people have long awaited, was issued yesterday. Starting from noon today, negotiations to resolve pending issues must be concluded within fifteen days. This is Chairman Chiang's wise decision, a patriotic and people-loving decision, especially a decision to protect the Chinese Communist Party and give it another opportunity to fulfill the agreement.</p>
<p>For the sake of the Chinese people, naturally, we earnestly hope that the Communist Party will not miss this opportunity again. Even for the sake of the Communist Party itself, to show that their party members still have a genuine concept of loving the motherland, it is best not to miss this opportunity again.</p>
<p>(1) Complete cessation of conflicts in the Northeast, (2) Complete restoration of domestic transportation, (3) Prompt implementation of the agreement on army demobilization, reorganization, and unified compilation – these three items are major events that the entire nation unanimously hopes to resolve urgently. Now that there is a fifteen-day negotiation opportunity, we hope that everyone will prioritize the country and the people, and cherish these fifteen days twelve thousand times, cherish every hour, every minute, every second within these fifteen days, never let it pass by fruitlessly, never let it be perfunctory, and in the end, it's still empty talk, equivalent to not talking.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Enlai said, "These fifteen days are a suspension of fighting, not a ceasefire." Whether it's a suspension of fighting or a ceasefire, our common people only ask that everyone bring sincere good intentions, say one thing and mean it, say one thing and do it. Only in this way can we truly not miss the opportunity again. "A man's word is his bond." With "trust," then people can negotiate with each other, and parties can negotiate with each other. We earnestly hope that any political party, especially the Chinese Communist Party, will use "trust" to guarantee that this opportunity for peaceful negotiations will not be missed again. The overall situation in China will absolutely not allow any political party to drag it on with any excuses. Dragging it on further will be a dead end, a road to ruin! If they still intend to miss this opportunity, so that China cannot obtain a peaceful and tranquil situation, then they are definitely not Chinese statesmen but Chinese criminals!</p>
<p>Opening of the UNRRA Far East Conference</p>
<p>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Far East Conference opens today in our nation's capital. Representatives from nine countries – England, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, Australia, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the Philippines – after being accompanied by representatives from our government to inspect the famine situation in various disaster areas of our country, have already arrived in Nanjing to attend the conference. The main task of this conference is certainly to review work and strengthen the relief organization in the Far East, but in our opinion, the most urgent task is how to redistribute food to relieve the 30 million hungry people in China, so that they do not all become starving corpses.</p>
<p>China's war of resistance lasted the longest, the war extended throughout the country, and the losses were naturally the greatest. The rural areas in the occupied territories were exploited and devastated by the enemy and puppets for eight or nine years. In the rural areas of the Great Rear Area, due to supporting the nation's war of resistance and providing vast manpower and military rations, the desolate scene of abandoned fields is also readily apparent. Today's 30 million war refugees, reduced to hungry people crying for food, are entirely the result of the war of resistance. It is the duty of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to make every effort to provide relief. Former UNRRA Director Lehman once cabled Chairman Chiang of our country, saying: "The heroic resistance of your country's people against the common enemy of the United Nations, enduring such long years of hardship, will forever be admired by peace-loving people all over the world, and no people are more deserving of UNRRA assistance than the people of your country." Because of this, our country's current request to UNRRA for emergency relief is justified and deserved.</p>
<p>In January of this year, at the United Nations General Assembly in London, discussing the world food shortage, our country's representative, Ambassador Gu Weijun, requested that UNRRA provide one million tons of rice in 1946. In principle, this was agreed to by various countries, but in reality, in the first quarter of this year, China only received 18,000 tons of rice. In the second quarter, UNRRA planned to allocate 120,000 tons of rice to China, which was later reduced to 100,000 tons, which is too far from what we actually need. A drop in the bucket, what good does it do? Moreover, UNRRA's allocation of food is quite unfair. Our country's representative, Director Chiang Tingfu, argued on the basis of reason at the UNRRA conference, and pointed out that the UNRRA Food Bureau's allocation was unfair. China was only allocated 18,000 tons in the first quarter of this year, while Malaya received 58,000 tons, and the Dutch East Indies also received 55,000 tons, three times as much as China. With such unfair allocation, we don't know how the UNRRA organizers assess China's war of resistance. Later, Mr. Hoover, Chairman of the U.S. Relief Committee, came to China to investigate the famine, and our government and the public formally requested him to provide 200,000 tons of food per month from May to August of this year. After Mr. Hoover personally inspected the disaster areas and determined that the disaster situation was indeed serious, he expressed acceptance of our country's request to supply 200,000 tons of rice. Therefore, the problem now is how to make Hoover's promise a reality through UNRRA. Mr. Hoover said to us in Shanghai: "During this critical period from May to September, we must fully utilize the effectiveness of various transportation methods to distribute 200,000 tons of food to various places every month to relieve the famine." We also have no excessive expectations for the opening of this UNRRA Far East Conference, as long as Hoover's plan can be realized first, otherwise, nothing else can be discussed. Because the period from May to September is the time when our country has a gap between the old and new harvests, and food is most difficult to obtain. After the national autumn harvest, the famine situation will naturally ease slightly.</p>
<p>President Truman once appealed for the hungry people of the world, saying: "We cannot achieve peace and prosperity when famine, disease, and poverty make it impossible for people to survive." We hope that the representatives of various countries attending the Far East Conference will not forget President Truman's famous saying, and especially must know that the current situation in the Far East, whether in India or Korea, especially in our country, the severity of the food shortage is even greater than in Europe. The famine situation in Hunan Province can truly be described as horrific! However, at a time of such disaster in China, overseas Chinese in Siam are willing to save rice by economizing on food to transport it to their compatriots in the motherland, but they are still being blocked by the British, restricted by UNRRA's failure to issue export licenses for transporting grain, making Siamese rice seem so close yet unattainable to Chinese disaster victims. What justice is this based on! If the Chinese authorities remain silent at the UNRRA Far East Conference, they should be condemned by our people.</p>
<p>Finally, we cannot help but regret the current methods of UNRRA's food allocation. Food allocation should take "actual need" as the highest standard, otherwise it will be unfair and will lose the original intention of relieving famine. Recently, foreign newspapers and magazines have widely reported that "UNRRA's wheat is often sold on the black market in the South; and in the Soviet Union, UNRRA's food is stored for future use by the Soviet army." Whether these are rumors, UNRRA needs to send personnel to investigate. Drawing inferences from one instance, we also firmly advocate finding a reasonable and appropriate solution to the problem of UNRRA's food allocation in the Far East.</p>

<h3>After Referendum Rejects Monarchy, Italian Royal Family Prepares to Flee, Umberto Flies to Naples with Queen</h3>
<p>"Agence France-Presse, Naples, Italy, 5th" After the Italian referendum rejected the monarchy, King Umberto II is preparing to abdicate. Queen Marie-José and her four children arrived here by plane from Rome today and drove to Mariabye for a temporary stay. Two cruisers are currently docked in this port, but there is no sign of hasty preparations to escort the royal family out of the country. It is unknown where the royal family will flee, but it is generally believed that the Queen and her children intend to go to Egypt, while Umberto intends to go to Switzerland.</p>
<p>Prime Minister De Gasperi made a broadcast to the nation this evening, asking the people to respect the results of the referendum and saying that Italy should remain united and oppose any actions that hinder the country from participating in the construction of a new world.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] A Foreign Office spokesman said that the Allied authorities will not interfere in the outcome of the Italian referendum on the form of government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Rome Radio officially announced tonight the results of the election to determine the form of government in Italy: 12,182,855 votes in favor of a republican form of government, and 10,362,709 votes in favor of a monarchical form of government.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Italian Ministry of the Interior announced the election results this afternoon: in 34,046 districts calculated out of 35,236 districts, the Christian Democratic Party received 7,866,864 votes, the Socialist Party received 4,606,509 votes, and the Communist Party received 4,004,741 votes.</p>
<p>The History of the Savoy Royal Family's Rule of Italy [Reuters, London, 5th] After the Italian people voted against the monarchy, the Savoy Royal Family, which ruled Italy, became a relic of history. Umberto II, the last to be called Emperor, ascended the throne after the abdication of Emmanuel III and lost his title of "Lord of All People" after only a few weeks in power. The Savoy Royal Family's rule of Italy began in 1861, when Emmanuel II was declared King of Turin by the first Italian Parliament, but the history of the royal family dates back to the 11th century, when their ancestor, Berthold, had already settled on the western slopes of the Alps. Emmanuel II was the fifth of Italy, and several of them were unfortunate. Umberto I was assassinated in 1900, and Emmanuel III succeeded him. In 1922, Mussolini marched on Rome but did not issue a martial law order, thereby incurring the disgrace of "opening the door to welcome Fascism." He abdicated on May 9th and, after fleeing to Egypt, has become a forgotten figure. Although Umberto II succeeded to the throne and harbored ambitions, he was out of touch with the times and was not welcomed by the public. During his reign, he stayed in the palace and routinely met with the Prime Minister once a week to sign orders, but he was ultimately rejected by the people's vote.</p>

<h3>One Voice in the British House of Commons, Churchill and Attlee Echoing Each Other, Denouncing the Soviet Union. Churchill: Please Do Not Provoke America, Dear Old Friend Stalin. Attlee: The Soviet People Seem to Live in a Dark Forest.</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 5th] On the second day of the foreign policy debate in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Attlee and former Prime Minister Churchill put aside domestic disputes and unanimously made measured accusations against the Soviet Union (the main points of Churchill's speech, which this newspaper listened to on the London broadcast yesterday, have already been published). Churchill said in a calm tone, "From the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea, not only has a heavy curtain fallen, but behind the curtain is a vast land whose population, excluding the Soviet Union, accounts for almost one-third of the entire population of Europe. The seeds of the Third World War are sown there." Attlee expressed his full support for Foreign Secretary Bevin's accusation yesterday that the Soviet Union was obstructing the path to peace, and said: The difficulty lies in the fact that the Soviet Union insists on strictly interpreting the Potsdam Agreement according to its literal meaning, without any flexibility. I believe that the Soviet Union's actions disregard the spirit in which we participated in the Potsdam Agreement. The Soviet Union seems unable to understand the political systems and political opposition of Western countries. This is the real iron curtain, that is, the iron curtain in the mind. But I do not believe that we should judge the current world situation with a completely pessimistic attitude. I believe that no one is more responsible for overcoming the current difficulties than Foreign Secretary Bevin.</p>
<p>Hope for the Soviet Union. Churchill expressed regret that the Soviet Union regarded any agreement between Britain and the United States as an anti-Soviet bloc. Attlee also said: "I completely agree that making friends with neighboring countries is not an act of organizing a bloc, but we also do not want to make friends with Western countries alone. What we want is to make friends with all countries in the world." Churchill then said: It is unbelievable that the small number of capable people who control the central hub of the Soviet Union are so isolated from Western democracy. It is not in the Soviet Union's interest to provoke the United States. No nation is slower to develop hostile feelings towards foreign countries than the American people. What we hope from the Soviet Union is goodwill. If the Soviet Union encounters trouble, Britain will naturally fulfill its obligations and come to the aid of the Soviet Union. However, Britain does not approve of the indefinite postponement of peace treaties, which leaves millions of people in a semi-human state between heaven and hell, which will only encourage moral corruption or even trigger an active war.</p>
<p>Unite the World. Churchill called on people to support the United Nations organization, saying that this world organization is our last hope. A united world is better than a fragmented world, but a fragmented world is slightly better than a destroyed world. But Attlee said: We do not want to be pessimistic, which would divide Europe into two major camps. We should cooperate most closely with all Western countries, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries, and especially France. Germany should be regarded economically as a whole and indivisible. It is better to establish a federation politically. The country must be self-reliant, and we should continue to work to promote its economic unification and realize true democracy, which requires close cooperation with our great allies to complete.</p>
<p>The German Question. Churchill expressed dissatisfaction with the division of Germany into the Soviet-occupied zone and the Western-occupied zones, saying that the Soviet Union is doing its best to communize and Sovietize the entire occupied zone. Poland has lost all freedom to express its national will, and Austria and Hungary are suffocating under the heavy pressure of large numbers of Soviet troops. We should make peace with Germany, or only with any part of Germany that is still under our control. We should also make peace with Italy, which was our ally in the last two years of the war. If this kind of peace treaty cannot be achieved through negotiations between the United Nations, then I agree with Foreign Secretary Bevin's proposal to submit this matter to the United Nations organization, so that the twenty-one countries that actually fought the war can make the most effective resolution and promote its early realization.</p>
<p>Churchill's Witty Remarks. Attlee said: We hope that the Soviet people, as if they were living in a dark forest every day, do not know the sunshine, breeze, and air of freedom and democracy. Churchill said: The American eagle rests on its perch, this startled bird has long claws and a beak, glaring vigilantly, motionless, while Mr. Gromyko (the Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council) uses a sharp sickle to provoke it day by day, sometimes touching its beak, sometimes touching its wings, sometimes touching its tail feathers. The United States has remained silent, but it would be a mistake to think that it will remain silent when its chest is touched. I dare to offer this friendly advice to my old comrade in arms, Marshal Stalin, more definitively. At this point in Churchill's speech, the entire audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>The Spanish Question. Churchill and Attlee both spoke about the Spanish question. Churchill approved of Franco's policy of standing aside. Churchill said: The Franco government is "one of the least aggressive in the world. In fact, Spain under Franco's rule is more free than Poland at this time, and ordinary people also enjoy greater security and comfort." Attlee said: We must take the most careful action to overthrow the current government of Spain and replace it with a suitable government.</p>

<h3>The Shipping Industry Expresses Shock: British Merchants Attempt to Regain Navigation Rights Under the Guise of Relief, Urging the Government to Consider Carefully Opening Inland River Navigation Rights.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's report stated that the Supreme National Defense Council passed the Executive Yuan's proposal to "open inland river navigation rights." This has a significant impact on the development of China's shipping industry. The reporter specifically visited Mr. Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association. According to him, the shipping industry is extremely shocked by this measure by the government. Because British merchants, under the guise of transporting relief supplies, are attempting to regain their inland river navigation rights. The current lease of British ships will expire on the 15th of next month. The shipping industry has repeatedly appealed to the government. Now the government is going to open important ports such as Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Wuhan on the Yangtze River, and still allow foreign ships to dock. Those who do not understand the plight of the shipping industry may say that this will help with repatriation transportation. In fact, our existing commercial ships have reached 500,000 tons, which is the number before the war. Among them, the Yangtze River accounts for more than 200,000 tons, such as the Jiangshun, Jiang'an, Jianghua, Jiangxin, Jiangping, Jiangjing, etc. of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the Minquan, Minlian, Minyi, etc. of Minsheng Company, and the Changxing, Yongjia, etc. of Sanbei Company, and the Dada, Hongda, etc. of Dada Datong Company, totaling more than 150 ships. After the victory, most of them were engaged in transporting troops, prisoners of war, and repatriates without pay. Now the transportation of prisoners of war is about to be completed, and all ships can be responsible for repatriation and general cargo and passenger transportation. It is estimated that the carrying capacity can transport more than one million tons back and forth per month, based on an average of two and a half trips per month. And the export cargo from Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Wuhan is no more than 200,000 tons at most. Currently, it is extremely difficult for ships sailing down the Yangtze River to find cargo, and there are many return voyages with empty tons. The fundamental reason is that the economies of various regions have not yet returned to normal. Except for repatriation transportation in Chongqing, cargo and passengers on all routes are scarce, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is about to have a large number of ships sailing, which will create a surplus. The government is urged to carefully consider opening inland river navigation rights, so as not to easily lose the navigation rights that were recently recovered, and to cause the shipping industry, which has just seen a glimmer of dawn, to collapse again.</p>
<h3>Eighty-Four Public and Religious Organizations Welcome Cardinal Tian Gengxin, A Lively Gathering, Heading to Nanjing this Morning to Pay Respects to Chairman Jiang.</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Archbishop Tian Gengxin, the first cardinal of our country, was publicly elected by the Chinese Catholic Church as one of the seventy cardinal bishops of the Roman Curia on Christmas last year. He went abroad in early February of this year to attend the inauguration ceremony. Recently, he flew to Shanghai via Manila from Rome. This morning, he will take a car to Nanjing. Next Wednesday, he will leave Nanjing for Qingdao. After staying for a few days, he will go to Beiping to take office as the Archbishop of Beiping Catholic Archdiocese.</p>
<p>Eighty-four groups welcome Cardinal Tian and Mayor Wu (Photo by Gu Tingpeng)</p>
<p>Mr. Song Hanzhang Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>The Shanghai Catholic Action Association, the Catholic Charitable Enterprise Association, Aurora University, and 84 other Catholic units held a reception at the Aurora University Auditorium from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon to welcome him. A large oil painting of the Cardinal was hung high in front of the auditorium, and colored arches were erected. At 6:00 p.m., Cardinal Tian arrived at the meeting with Bishop Zhang Weisudu. Military music was played in unison, and the atmosphere was very lively. Among the guests were Archbishop Zanin, the Papal Representative to China, Bishop Lu Yiliang, the secretary of the Papal Representative to China, Bishop Huijiang Jiliang of Shanghai, Mayor Wu Guozhen, President Yu Youren, Committee Member Kong Xiangxi, Committee Member Pan Gongzhan, and Catholic representatives Zhu Zhiyao, Song Hanzhang, Zhu Kongjia, Xue Zuheng, Xu Tongyuan, Lu Yinggeng, and others, totaling more than 300 people. Song Hanzhang represented the various public organizations in delivering a welcoming speech, saying that Catholicism has a history of more than 300 years in China. The appointment of Bishop Tian as the first cardinal bishop of our country is not only a glory for Catholicism, but also a glory for China.</p>
<p>Respect on behalf of the Pope</p>

<h3>The Trial of the Xue Monk Murder Case: Seven Criminals Have an Atrocious Attitude, Claiming to Be Falsely Accused with Sarcastic Words, Interrogation for Four Hours, The Court Ordered a Postponement</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the Military Court of the First Pacification Zone brought to trial the Xue Monk case, in which a monk was tortured to death by the enemy's military police for rescuing a downed American pilot. The defendants, Kuboe Yasuharu, Kataoka Akira, Omori Mitsuo, Noma Sadaji, Morishita Munetaka, Hayahara Isao, and Setani Tsutao, were all former members of the Special High Police Unit of the enemy's Pudong Military Police.</p>
<p>After the court opened, the prosecutor first read the indictment, and the presiding judge questioned each defendant one by one. All of them categorically denied that they had ever tortured Xue's family or abused and killed the Xue monk. Then, the witness Xue Guanyuan stated that she was one of the perpetrators. Xue Quanyun also identified Noma. Xue Yatou pointed out Noma, Kataoka Akira, and Hayahara Isao, and Xue Jinxing said that the person who beat him was not among these seven people. When asked again, Noma and the other three still denied it, saying that the three of them were more famous in the team, so they were falsely accused. As for the investigation of the U.S. Air Force, it was carried out by the escaped captain Ono Shigeru, Hirata, and Benyama (also on the run). At this point, the prosecutor stood up and said that when Noma and Kataoka were extradited from the Japanese prisoner-of-war administration office, there were two people with each name, but the witness only identified the defendants in court now, which shows that it is definitely not a false accusation. As for the other defendants, who belonged to the Special High Police Unit, they were all related to this tragic case, and the court is requested to impose a sentence in accordance with the law. The presiding judge then asked each defendant what their opinions were, and Noma and others still denied it loudly. Especially Noma, Kataoka, and Hayahara Isao had an arrogant attitude and spoke sarcastically. Noma also demanded that Ono Shigeru and Hirata, who were on the run, be arrested and brought to justice to clarify the truth. The interrogation continued until 6:00 p.m., but there was still no result. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Evacuated German Nationals, More Than 1,000 People, Will Return to Their Country Within a Month</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the list of the first batch of German nationals to be evacuated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, about 1,000 people, is expected to be transported back to their country by U.S. ships before the end of this month. It is reported that this batch of names includes not only German Nazis, but also non-Nazi German businessmen and technicians. Among these non-Nazis, there are many who have provided direct or indirect assistance to us during the War of Resistance. Moreover, in the regulations on the management of German nationals promulgated by the Executive Yuan, there were original provisions for applying for non-evacuation for German nationals with good conduct who have not acted against us. Therefore, the German nationals in this batch who believed that they met these provisions applied for non-evacuation several weeks ago. Now that the news of the evacuation has suddenly come out, the German nationals who applied for non-evacuation are all feeling extremely confused. The reason is that some of these German nationals have resided in our country for generations, and some have even applied to be naturalized as citizens of our country, and their original hometowns in their home country no longer have any houses or residences.</p>
<h3>British Tramcars Will Extend Their Operating Hours</h3>

<h3>Strengthening Transportation Between Pudong and Puxi, Adding New Ferries, Planning Three-Story Cabins</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The municipal transportation of this city has expanded greatly, and the houses are lined up in rows. Even Pudong, which is closest to the bustling area, is separated by a river, and the construction situation is vastly different. The authorities are now gathering Chinese and foreign experts to design the city and jointly plan the implementation. It is heard that in addition to the original eight ferries that are still in operation, the city ferry company has recently expanded its business and added new ferries. The style has been drawn by experts. It is planned to be 120 feet long and 30 feet wide, divided into three floors. The top floor is the driver's room, the middle floor has ten car washes, and the lower floor can carry more than 400 passengers. There are automatic forward machines in the front and rear, which can move forward and backward freely, which is extremely convenient. Orders have been placed with the United Kingdom and the United States, and delivery can be made in six months. At the same time, ten UNRRA landing craft have arrived in Shanghai and may be used. Experts are currently inspecting them. According to the person in charge, developing Pudong is the most ideal, but convenient transportation should be planned first, so that people do not feel the hardship of crossing the river, and safety is guaranteed. Then the Public Works Bureau can find ways to open the Pudong trunk road, build civilian villages, etc. In less than three years, the results will be considerable. The most problematic thing now is the construction of docks on both sides of the river. It may be possible to use the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou and the wharf south of Roosevelt first, which are being inspected separately. As for the ferry company being changed to a joint government-business operation, it has been approved by the Municipal Council. According to rumors, two-thirds are business shares and one-third are government shares.</p>

<h3>Fu Sinian Talks to Reporters: Restoring Peking University to its Former Glory, Seemingly Filled with Confidence; The May Fourth Movement of That Year Opposed the Traitorous Beiyang Government; Does the Current Student Movement Oppose the Government That Endured Eight Years of Resistance Against Japan?</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Correspondent] This morning, our reporter visited Fu Sinian, the president of Peking University. Mr. Fu's hair has already turned white, but his spirit is still as vigorous as ever. When talking about restoring "Peking University to its former glory," he seemed full of confidence. He holds somewhat disapproving views on the student movements that are surging across various regions. He said, "I will consider allowing students from Beiping Provisional University who enjoy causing trouble to transfer to Peking University." He also said, "The current government, though not entirely satisfactory, is, after all, the government that endured eight years of resistance against Japan. It is acceptable for students to make demands, but they should not overstep the boundaries. I will consider reasonable demands, but I will not listen to unreasonable ones!" Therefore, he will abide by all the regulations of the Ministry of Education and enforce strict discipline. "Absolutely no bad students!"</p>
<p>Talking About the College of Engineering</p>
<p>The students of the College of Engineering of Beiping Provisional University have repeatedly petitioned Mr. Fu and other relevant authorities, requesting that the College of Engineering be independent and not jointly managed by Peking University and Tsinghua University. Regarding this issue, Mr. Fu said, "I am truly angry. I am in charge of Peking University, and I simply do not have the energy to co-manage the College of Engineering. Their students claim that co-management is imperialism, which is simply an insult to the reputations of Peking University and Tsinghua University!"</p>
<p>When in Chongqing, Mr. Fu had generally stated that professors who participated in puppet organizations would not be rehired. Therefore, the professors of Beiping Provisional University are feeling uneasy and, I hear, are brewing countermeasures. When the reporter mentioned this issue, Mr. Fu said, "What was said back then can be ignored. In short, I have my own professors. The professors of the Southwest Associated University abandoned their meager belongings, each bringing only fifteen kilograms, to move back to Beiping. Why? The professors of Peking University, except for the medical school, have all been invited. The former staff of Peking Union Medical College Hospital who are teaching at the Provisional University's medical school can be retained because they are academically strong."</p>
<p>Evaluating Zhou Zuoren</p>
<p>Regarding Zhou Zuoren, he had this to say: "He has never written a single satisfying article in his life, nor has he ever done a single satisfying thing. His participation in the puppet organization is also in this vein." However, Mr. Fu believes that Zhou Zuoren "is among the lesser offenders among the major traitors." His evaluation of Qian Daosun is quite different: "Compared to him, Qian Daosun is much more detestable. I heard that even after the Japanese Emperor issued the Imperial Rescript on Surrender, he still didn't believe that Japan's surrender was real!" Finally, he also talked about the difference between the student movement during the "May Fourth" period and the current student movement. Mr. Fu's view is as follows: "The May Fourth Movement opposed the traitorous Beiyang government. I personally participated in it, so I know very clearly. But who are they opposing now? Are they opposing the government that endured eight years of resistance against Japan? If that is the case, then they are also opposing the school, and I have no way to sympathize with them!"</p>
<p>Visiting the Wen Tianxiang Shrine</p>
<p>Mr. Fu said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek invited him again the day before yesterday for a "casual chat" for two hours while visiting the Wen Tianxiang Shrine and discussing many issues. Visiting the Wen Tianxiang Shrine was suggested by Mr. Fu. Chairman Chiang did not even know that there was a Wen Tianxiang Shrine in Beiping. They both agreed that promoting national integrity was very necessary. Therefore, he has already instructed the Beiping municipal authorities to renovate the shrine and to have the Fuxue Hutong Elementary School, which is currently using the shrine as its school site, take extra care to protect it because Wen Tianxiang wrote his Righteous Spirit Song and was imprisoned for three years and killed at this place. Mr. Fu said that the two large trees in the shrine indeed have their large branches extending southward, pointing towards the capital of the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>Peking University is currently engaging in construction to repair its school buildings in preparation for its restoration. Mr. Fu has indeed spent a lot of energy on this. He wants to restore "Peking University to its former glory." President Hu Shih has already departed from the United States and is returning to China via the Panama Canal. He will arrive in Nanjing in July and Beiping in August. More than thirty faculty and staff members who evacuated from Kunming have already arrived in Beiping. Mr. Fu said that, in any case, school will definitely start after the summer vacation. The Aviation Commission has also promised to help with the restoration, and by the end of June, 80% of the faculty, staff, and students can arrive. The entire Peking University can accommodate 4,500 students. About 1,000 are coming from Kunming, 2,000 are transferring from Beiping Provisional University, and another 1,500 new students will be admitted this summer.</p>

<h3>Kunyu Team's Farewell Match; Loses Again to Hualian; Fifty to Forty-Five</h3>
<p>The Kunyu basketball team played its last game in Shanghai last night, suffering another defeat to the local champion Hualian team. The final score was 50 to 45, with Hualian leading 28 to 17 at halftime. All proceeds from last night will be used for the basketball court flooring fund, totaling 4,103,000 yuan. The audience was about 2,000 people, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The game was entirely controlled by Hualian. In the first half, Hualian played with its best lineup, including Zhen Zhong, Xue Chongcheng, Zhang Songyuan, and Guangyi, leading all the way. Kunyu's lineup included Da Yun, Shi Kun, Xiang Cheng, Nan Zhen, and Yan Xiong. Last night, Hualian had excellent cooperation and coordination, but their shooting accuracy was lacking. Otherwise, they could have won by a large margin. In the second half, Zhen Zhong and Song Yuan were rested, replaced by Bote and Zhang Liangxiong, and the situation changed drastically. Kunyu took the opportunity to score nine consecutive points, reaching 26 to 28, and then 29 to 31. Hualian still showed no improvement, and Kunyu even took the lead at 33 to 31. Song Yuan re-entered the game, and Kunyu fell behind again, making it 42 to 33. Kunyu's fate was sealed, and the final score was 50 to 45. Tang Shikun and Ren Xiangcheng played very well, but Zhou Dayun did not make much of a contribution last night.</p>
<p>Chunqiu (Spring and Autumn)</p>
<h3>Remnant of Spring (Novel) (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>The sun had already risen below the horizon, but the sky was still gray. A drizzling rain permeated the bleak air. The wind blew through the treetops. The entire world seemed enveloped in a heavy fog, with no light, no warmth, no birdsong, no innocent and joyous laughter of young people.</p>
<p>Yet this was spring. After all, it was spring. Though in the darkness and cold, a very small flower was silently blooming.</p>
<p>The flower had no fragrance, for it was too small. And it grew on a thin, fragile stem, seeming as if it might fall off at any moment. But Jian Guang switched on the bedside lamp, and he discovered that the flower was red. Especially set against a white porcelain flowerpot and a few emerald green tender leaves, that little bit of red was simply strikingly red, startlingly red.</p>
<p>As if it had become a habit, whether in the morning or in the middle of the night, whenever Jian Guang woke up, he would always reach for his luminous watch on the pillow to take a look. If it was close to midnight, he would wait a while before falling asleep because the nurse would come to take his temperature at midnight. If it was close to dawn, he would naturally not sleep anymore because he had to take medicine at six o'clock. Now he looked at his watch and saw that it was already 5:45, almost time to take his medicine, although it was still pitch black outside, no different from midnight.</p>
<p>Jian Guang put the watch back on the pillow, turned his head, and gazed excitedly at that little red flower. The flower was placed on a tea table by his bedside. He had asked a friend to buy it for him just yesterday. He had instructed his friend to buy a light-colored, budding flower so that he could watch the pale, tender petals emerge from the bud one by one. Unexpectedly, overnight, the flower had bloomed silently. Bloomed: such a startlingly red color!</p>
<p>He stroked his thin chest and felt his heart beating very fast. Yes, he had once loved red. Three years ago, he had chased after red as if he were crazy—red rouge, red lips, red fingernails, red dancing skirts... But now, he was sick. He had coughed up piles of fresh blood. Blood was red, a red fresher than roses, a red more flamboyant than rouge, but it was blood... How terrible!</p>
<p>He did not admit that his mind was somewhat abnormal, but he was now truly afraid of seeing red things. He steadied himself and stared hard at the little red flower on the tea table. Finally, with a "snap," he switched off the lamp.</p>
<p>"It's red again! What cruel teasing!" He turned his head inward, calling out in his heart, painfully and softly.</p>
<p>Of course, he would not fall asleep again, but his eyes closed. In the moment they closed, a pure white figure flashed in from the doorway.</p>
<p>Daylight, dark clouds, wind, and rain were of no use; there were still a few faint rays of light in the room.</p>
<p>Miss Li Ying's shadow gradually became clearer. She was wearing white clothes and a white hat. Her oval face was white, her round arms were white, her whole body was white. However, in all that dazzling white, there was a point of extremely distinct and striking red: her delicate red lips.</p>
<p>Jian Guang heard her walk in. The slight sound of her footsteps was what he knew best: slow, hesitant, and seemingly with some timidity. The faint fragrance of her hair was also what he knew best: serene, fragrant, and with a hint of the sweetness of roses. He immediately associated it with that point of red standing out in the pure white, a red that shook his soul...</p>
<p>The drizzling rain splattered on the glass window, drip-drop, and Miss Li Ying's rubber shoes fell on the floor, also drip-drop.</p>
<p>Jian Guang knew that she was standing by the bed. However, he dared not open his eyes or turn his head. He stubbornly held down his fiercely beating heart and buried his head in the pillow. That lovely and terrible scene flashed before his eyes again:</p>
<p>Half a month ago, the spring sunlight was warm, bright, filled with intoxicating color and fragrance.</p>
<p>Jian Guang sat quietly in the garden. His home was small but very beautiful, with weeping willows, grass, a fishpond, a rockery, and flowerbeds filled with fragrant flowers. It was afternoon at this time, and the sunlight was slightly slanted to the west. He sat under the shade of the willow, eagerly waiting for someone.</p>
<p>He seemed somewhat tired because he had just returned home from the hospital to recuperate. His illness had not healed, and the doctor had instructed him to continue resting at home. Therefore, his head gradually leaned back against the chair, and his eyelids gradually drooped. But just then, the sound of light footsteps startled him.</p>
<p>Was it her? Had she really come as promised!</p>
<p>She was Li Ying, a nurse he had met in the hospital. The first time she came to feed him medicine with a medicine tray, he had been captivated by her beauty. He thought she was like a white rose with a red heart—her whole body was white, but her delicate lips were surprisingly red. He was fascinated by this strange red!</p>
<p>He was young, passionate, and had experienced countless beautiful dreams. Logically, it shouldn't have been too difficult, but he was too weak. Every time she came, he could only stare with ardent eyes at her bright red lips. He simply didn't have the strength to speak. Until yesterday, when he left the hospital, he finally mustered the courage to give her a slip of paper with these two sentences written on it:</p>
<p>"I love you! I cannot leave you! Please come to my house at 3:00 PM tomorrow."</p>
<p>It was originally like reaching out a hand into the vast void, and even more vaguely waiting. He had no confidence in his heart. Unexpectedly, she had come as promised! How excited this should make him!</p>
<p>Like obtaining a long-desired treasure, he jumped up from the chair and staggered forward to greet her, grabbing her hand...</p>
<p>Sitting together under the shade of the willow, they began to talk. She told him that she had noticed his feelings long ago and told him that as long as it could make him happy, she would be willing to come and see him often, hoping that his health would recover soon.</p>
<p>The sunlight shone on the whitewashed wall, making the wall red as if it had drunk wine. Jian Guang's face was also red as if he had drunk wine.</p>
<p>Finally, he forgot his illness. He returned to the beautiful dreams he had had before: spring, everywhere was light, everywhere was fragrance, red flowers, red lips... fragrant, passionate... the spring of young people, his spring!...</p>
<p>Too excited! A strong fire burned in his heart. He embraced her, disregarding everything. He wanted to kiss her!</p>
<p>But just as she was making a slight struggle, his hand loosened, his face contorted in pain, and fresh blood gushed out of his mouth like a tide!</p>
<p>The events of half a month ago seemed like yesterday. He remembered it clearly: the bright red blood flowed and flowed. She screamed in fright. His parents and family rushed to the garden, and they hurriedly sent him back to the hospital. He remembered even more clearly: On the first night he re-entered the hospital, she sat by his bed for two hours, saying only one sentence: "I harmed you. I shouldn't have come to see you!" He also remembered: From that day on, she no longer served him, nor did she come to see him much. She only came for a while every morning, very politely asking, "Are you well today?" and then left.</p>
<p>Now, she stood before his bed, politely asking him again, "Mr. Shen, are you well today?"</p>
<p>Jian Guang opened his eyes, and a teardrop rolled onto the pillow. He did not answer, only nodded slightly.</p>
<p>She was somewhat moved and said gently, "Doctor He said that your illness will definitely get better, but you must be pure in heart and have few desires!"</p>
<p>Pure in heart and have few desires! Jian Guang's heart sank, and another teardrop rolled out.</p>
<p>Li Ying quietly walked out, her steps light, her hair fragrant, springtime was hers, she was very happy. In the corridor, she met the young Doctor He, she lowered her head shyly.</p>
<p>"Darling!" Doctor He looked around to make sure no one was there, stepped forward to grab her hand, and affectionately complained, "Why do you still go to see that guy?" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Start of Shanghai Art Work</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>The Shanghai Art Association, established during this year's Art Festival—March 25th—has, through two months of effort, prepared this Victory Boxing Exhibition. Is its content suitable for our current needs? Can it express the changes that the eight-year war of resistance has brought to art? Can it represent the main trends of the entire Shanghai art scene? We dare not be responsible for guaranteeing these things here, nor is it necessary, because everyone can examine and observe it for themselves and come to a conclusion. However, at least it should be acknowledged that this exhibition is the starting point for Shanghai art work. From now on, there will certainly be more, more practical, and more needed art work unfolding. If the association only wants to successfully hold this exhibition today, and writers only want to have better works to participate in this exhibition, and the public only observes the quality of Shanghai art work at this exhibition, then all of this would be in vain.</p>
<p>During this revision of the elementary school curriculum standards meeting, everyone raised the issue of the current lack of art teachers. Therefore, what we ask of the Shanghai Art Association, for the sake of promoting art education, is that planning and implementing art teacher training is the first important task.</p>
<p>The creation of art works depends on theoretical guidance, and the recognition of art works depends on the establishment of criticism. The introduction of foreign art and the preservation and development of inherent art depend on the development of research and organization work. Here, we really should at least need an art magazine, which is the second important task.</p>
<p>The success or failure of the Victory Boxing Exhibition, in terms of the minimum requirements for current Shanghai art work, does not occupy an absolutely important position, because it is the beginning.</p>

<h3>Flying Together (47) Zhao Qingge</h3>
<p>As a result, Zhang Xian became complacent, venting his anger on Lihua and gaining benefits at the same time. So he quickly changed his tone and said to Mrs. Mo:</p>
<p>"Whether to increase the money or not is not important, it's just that your young lady's temper must be changed. I'm teaching her so hard, and if she can study hard and diligently, I guarantee that she can be on stage by next year at the latest. But she is just too disobedient."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Master! Don't worry, I will definitely teach her a lesson and tell her to listen to you in the future," Mrs. Mo said with a smile. She was really happy! Happy for that dream that was about to come true.</p>
<p>Lihua heard all of this. She secretly complained about her unfortunate fate! She knew that she would not have good days for a long time. She hated Zhang Xian, and at the same time she hated Mrs. Mo! What she did not understand was: Mrs. Mo was her biological mother, so why did she have the heart to force her to be sent to a bad person to be ruined and abused? If it was for her good, then she was clearly being subjected to the most cruel punishment! If she was guilty, she was only a nine-year-old child, oh, she was innocent! She had no reason to be beaten so badly, to be trampled upon in the freezing cold of winter! But what could she do? She had no power to resist! Mrs. Mo taught her to obey, and obedience was filial piety! She could only swallow her tears forever, which was her fate!</p>
<p>Lihua finally fell ill and could not get out of bed for several days. Mrs. Mo was so anxious that she hired many famous doctors to treat her. Not for anything else, but to hope that she would recover soon and continue to learn opera. Naturally, also because she was her daughter. For these two reasons, Lihua found it hard to live and hard to die! Sorrow grew in her heart day by day! She vaguely felt that she was no longer a person, but an object, a cat or a dog! Her life was controlled by others, and her death was also controlled by others! Others could arbitrarily dispose of her, and others could arbitrarily slaughter her!</p>
<p>"These, these, do you know them, Daddy!"</p>
<p>In her most painful moments, Lihua would whisper this to the night sky, reaching out a hand for help to the sky.</p>
<p>But the night was dark! In the darkness, there was no justice, no fairness!</p>

<h3>Foreign Rice Has Arrived, Grain Prices Gradually Decline, Rice Market is Returning to Normal, White Rice Entered the Border Yesterday at 50,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market sales were still slow, and people's sentiment was further softening. Market transactions were extremely rare, with both Japonica and Indica rice prices falling by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. White Indica rice had no formal trading open. Flour continued to fall by 800 to 900 yuan, and bran fell again by a small amount of 100 to 200 yuan. Yellow soybeans from Henan province continued to arrive, but sales were average, with prices falling by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes remained oversupplied, falling again by 400 to 500 yuan. The oil market was flooded with goods and sales were slow, with prices falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. New broad beans continued to arrive in large quantities, but lower-grade goods fell by a small amount of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Wheat and corn prices were average. New wheat had limited trading and has not opened. Red sorghum continued to fall by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were in short supply and remained strong. Plain flour also decreased by 50 yuan per catty. Yesterday, rice arrived in the city. According to information from the rice market, a total of more than 4,000 shi (a unit of dry measure, approximately 120 liters) of seven types, including white rice, arrived. The types and quantities are as follows: White rice 1,841 shi, early rice 534 shi, Du Indica 57 shi, white rice 235 shi, thin rice 1,332 shi, Yang Indica 70 shi, and Wu Indica 904 shi.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Special Commissioner for Grain Administration, Wang Daren, nearly 300,000 tons of foreign rice ordered by the Ministry of Food and the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation have arrived to date, all of which were ordered from the Brazil in South America. In addition, the 290,000 tons of rice for China decided by the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration can also be shipped to China in the short term. With the large-scale arrival of foreign rice, the future of the people's food supply is very promising.</p>
<h3>Merchants Purchasing Foreign Rice · Bank of China Supplies Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>The import trade of foreign rice will soon become greatly active. Currently, British firm Jardine Matheson, French firm Compagnie Asiatique de Commerce, Jewish firm Fu Shuen &amp; Co., and Chinese firm Renren Enterprise Co., are handling the import trade of foreign rice, contacting Brazil and other regions in South America to order foreign rice. It is reported that the cost of shipping each bag (one shi and two dou of rice) from Brazil to Shanghai, including freight, is about 20 US dollars. Currently, the Bank of China authorities plan to provide as much foreign exchange as possible for the purchase of foreign rice, and the ordering procedures are also very convenient.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere for Using US Dollars to Assist Purchases is Strong, Gold Prices Turn Upward from Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market initially weakened due to reports that the issue of war and peace was again showing signs of hope, but the sentiment for using US dollars to assist purchases was still easy to pull up the price. The market opened slightly lower in the morning, and various parties continuously released gold, further lowering the price. After 10 a.m., the Bank of China allocated 1.81 million, totaling 127 bars. After that, the market turned from calm to weak again. Before noon, it had fallen below the 1.8 million mark, but buyers who were maintaining the price at low levels began to become active again. At noon, the price was around 1.81 million. The market was still flat in the early afternoon, but the soaring US dollar stimulated buying, pushing the price up to 1.855 million before leveling off. The final result was not much different from the previous close. Gold ornaments were at 196,000, silver bullion at 2,200, silver dollars were stable, private exchange rates were average, and interest rates ranged from 17 cents to 14 cents.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of strong US dollars assisting purchases was strong, and news continued to spread. Therefore, after the market opened in the morning, the price of 2,330 yuan was only slightly affected by the gold market, and the price of 2,320 yuan remained firm for a long time. At noon, it was still struggling at the original price. In the afternoon, it was finally stimulated, and it became even more difficult to apply for US exchange. Importers rushed to settle US dollars, and a sudden surge in prices rose by more than 100 yuan in an instant, reaching a high price of 2,450 yuan. Then, it slightly retraced and hovered around 2,400 yuan. The final result was an increase of 55 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong banknotes were stable, and the buying price increased slightly. US exchange rates were nominally flat but privately tight, and the selling prices of Indian and Hong Kong exchange rates were slightly higher, but trading was less.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Pulled Up Again</h3>
<p>Public bonds were cautious yesterday, with both buyers and sellers waiting for an opportunity. The range of price fluctuations was narrow. Unified type C opened crossing the 6,000 yuan mark, trading around 6,250 yuan. After the opening, it was briefly pushed up to 6,370 yuan before sellers began to release. The low price only dropped to 6,130 yuan before being pulled up again. The final result was an increase of 500 yuan from the previous close. Types A and B rose by 350 yuan, and Types D and E also rose by 300 yuan. Bidding prices continued to rise after the close.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Trends are Promising</h3>
<p>Tea prices are not low... Exports are difficult to become clear. Recently, shops in this street, Suzhou, Wuxi, Tianjin and other places have been actively acquiring red and green tea varieties, and trading is still lively. Prices are also unusually sharp. The upward trend may expand. As for the foreign firms' tea market, Zhen Mei and Zhen Mei green teas, which specialize in sales to Africa and Morocco, are still favored in those regions, but new goods have not yet been produced. Therefore, foreign firms are choosing Chen tea with excellent quality to meet the needs. However, the sellers are loosening their grip, so the trend continues to be promising. In addition, according to news from the production area of Qimen black tea, new goods have already been launched on the market, but due to the high cost of all kinds of taxes and fees, the cost is also high, at least 200,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kilograms). If viewed from the perspective of foreign countries, there is an appetite for prices between 120,000 and 130,000 yuan. As for the new Bailin black tea that arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, although Jardine Matheson is in negotiations, the price offered is only 80,000 yuan per dan, but the cost for the seller has reached over 100,000 yuan, so whether the deal will be concluded is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>In the Midst of Securities Exchange Opening, Stock Buying is Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the buying of Chinese stocks was still stimulated by unpopular stocks. Great China Match, Sin Ho Underwear, New Asia, and Sino-French were the most popular. However, due to excessive surges in the middle of the day, high prices were followed by declines. Wing On Yarn's high price was 6,100 yuan, and the low price was 5,830 yuan. Mayer's high price was 4,550 yuan, and the low price was 4,330 yuan. King Fook's high price was 337 yuan, and the low price was 303 yuan. Around noon, the market generally stabilized. In the end, Wing On Yarn and Mayer continued to be slightly favored, and King Fook, New Kwong, and Keen Hing rose by 5% to 10%. Among the unpopular small and medium-sized stocks, except for Wing Foong, which did not show any signs of recovery, most of them rose by another 5% to 20%. Veteran stocks were also favored by large buyers, rising by 10% to 20%. Bidding prices continued to rise in the afternoon. Foreign stocks continued to be pushed up. Ewo Silk Mill briefly rose to around 13,200 yuan before some profit-taking led to a small decline to 12,500 yuan. Ewo Brewery declined from 2,900 yuan, Asia General from 4,300 yuan, and Asia from 2,100 yuan. In the end, compared to the previous close, Ewo Silk Mill, Asia, British American Tobacco, and Wheelock Marden slightly increased, while Ewo Brewery, Steel, Paper, and Asia General each rose by about 10%.</p>
<h3>Import of Cosmetics and Other Items: Foreign Exchange Will Not Be Provided Unless Approved by the Bank of China</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A reporter recently heard rumors that the Central Bank would stop the settlement of foreign exchange for certain imported goods. They visited Mr. Lin Weiying, Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank, for confirmation. According to Mr. Lin, the Central Bank has noticed that the import volume of cosmetics and fruits has been quite considerable recently. Therefore, it has notified all designated banks handling foreign exchange that, starting from May 28, if importers and exporters apply to settle foreign exchange for these imported goods, they must first obtain approval from the Central Bank before they are allowed to settle. Otherwise, no foreign exchange will be provided. It is reported that these imported goods include: (1) Cosmetics, shaving soap, face cream, toothpaste, talcum powder, hair water, and products for the mouth, teeth, and hair. (2) Fresh fruits. (3) Gelatin products. (4) Canned foods. (5) Fountain pens. (6) Toiletries.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Implements Price Limits, Designating Ten Items Including Electrical Materials</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that general prices have been rising recently, and the implementation of price limits and price negotiations should be strictly enforced to achieve practical results. The prices of electrical materials, tea, laundry, department stores, barber shops, foil products, and other ten industries that have been publicly negotiated have been notified to the police bureau to send personnel to inspect them at any time to see if there are any violations. If there are any deliberate violations or arbitrary price increases, they will be detained and prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Refined Salt Arrives in Shanghai for the First Time</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Zhe ship returned to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday. In addition to transporting northern goods such as melon seeds, jujubes, and walnuts, there were also 5,000 packages of refined salt, which were declared by the Jiuda Refined Salt Company. The import of refined salt is the first time since the war. In addition, the Cai E ship, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, transported 1,600 tons of edible salt from Lianyungang. It is reported that the salt needs to be transferred to ships for transportation to Wuhan.</p>
<p>Also, Taikoo's Beihai ship sailed south today, carrying 18,000 railway sleepers to Hong Kong, which will be used by the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway.</p>
<h3>Worsted Wool Prices are Chaotic</h3>
<p>The worsted wool market has lacked standard prices recently because the supply of goods is extremely tight and most transactions are piecemeal. Especially for summer goods in high demand, transactions depend on whether they are released first. If the buyer is looking for goods, the seller will raise the selling price. Conversely, if the seller needs cash and wants to sell, the buyer will say that actual sales are poor, and even if the price is lowered somewhat, it will be difficult to sell. In short, the success or failure of the current selling price completely depends on opportunity. There is also evidence that if Company A quotes 55,000 yuan per bolt, Company B will shout 60,000 yuan. If more than ten yards are sold at 60,000 yuan, Company C will quote 62,000 or 63,000 yuan. If two or three sets are sold, then Company D will want to quote 65,000 or 66,000 yuan. Several companies in the industry, such as Kwok Tai and Wai Cheong, have gone bankrupt due to the influence of high-interest loans.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Fall Unanimously · Calico Market Conditions are Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was weak and unable to recover. Large yarn mills such as Yema saw their prices fall by 40,000, with few results. The remaining 20-count mixed brands also fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The 42-count yarns saw the worst decline, plummeting by a huge 130,000 yuan. The 32-count fine yarns also fell by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. The trend still seems weak, and morale is also very low.</p>
<p>The cloth market has slowed down due to stagnant actual transactions, and morale has turned weak. There are many sellers looking to exit, so the situation has softened. All grades of cotton cloth have fallen by 250 to 1,000 yuan. However, 12-pound calico is still needed by Tianjin merchants, so it has risen by 500 yuan alone. In the afternoon, it was heard that Sichuan, Shanxi, and northern Anhui areas had a good demand for broadcloth and other cloths, so the market price rebounded by 500 yuan compared to the morning. Yesterday, the New York American cotton cable reported a drop of 2 to 16 points per pound. The recent price was 28.26 US dollars, the forward price was 18.63, and the Metling spot price was 28.88. The cotton market in this city was mediocre, but trading was more active. Private yarn factories such as Shih Foong, Lai Sang, Ka Foong, and Chun Hing all had purchases.</p>
<h3>Fuel Trading is Sparse</h3>
<p>According to news from the Coal Industry Association, the association's market has been extremely sluggish recently. Among them, coal briquettes are the most sluggish item. Not only is the supply of various grades of goods abundant, but there is also a lack of sales. Most retail buyers dislike the high prices and cannot afford them. The bituminous coal market is doing slightly better. Anthracite coal is neglected due to seasonal factors. The future of fuel is unanimously seen as weak. According to news from the firewood and charcoal industry, recently, the quantity of firewood and charcoal transported from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Shanghai is considerable, with an average of about 4,000 to 5,000 dan arriving every day, and the prices are very low.</p>
<h3>Deposit Reserve: Tianjin and Beijing Negotiate Payment in Substitutes</h3>
<p>[Tianjin News] The Banking Law formulated by the Ministry of Finance has been issued to Tianjin. According to Chen Lihou, Chairman of the Tianjin Bankers Association, according to the usual practice in the banking industry, half of the deposits must be retained to meet withdrawals, and the other half must be circulated. If another 20% is set aside as a reserve, then only 30% of the circulating funds will be available, which poses a risk of illiquidity. The Tianjin and Beijing Bankers Associations plan to present the actual difficulties to the authorities and suggest that the reserve be paid not in legal tender, but in the form of marketable securities or other valuable items, so that the circulating funds will not be reduced.</p>
<h3>Old Casing Export Fails to Meet Standards and is Returned</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of foreign price limits, not much casing is exported from China. Furthermore, a batch of small four-barrel casings were returned because they did not meet the standards. According to news from the casing industry, the returned casing was exported by a certain foreign firm. Because it was old casing, it did not meet the standards. Also, the foreign firm had already ceased operations when the casings were returned.</p>
<h3>Rosin Sales are Weak · Tallow Prices are Reported to be Rising in Production Areas</h3>
<p>Due to the ban on exports in recent years, there is a large amount of raw rosin in stock in the interior. Recently, shipments from production areas have been continuously transported, but sales are weak. The current price of raw rosin in the Shanghai market is around 20,000 yuan per dan, and it is difficult to transport large quantities. Because raw rosin has few uses, it must be processed into refined rosin before it can be used as an industrial raw material. Currently, the price in the production area is only over 10,000 yuan per dan, plus transportation costs, which amount to at least 10,000 yuan per dan when it arrives in Shanghai. Therefore, most merchants who transport rosin from the interior to Shanghai are buying their own stock.</p>
<p>[Another report] Soap factories in Shanghai are currently purchasing large quantities of tallow from production areas, so the price of tallow in production areas is soaring. As a result, Shanghai is also following suit. The best price in the Shanghai market has reached over 80,000 yuan per dan, but in reality, coconut oil is arriving in a steady stream, and its price is equal to that of tallow, so the rising tallow price may be a temporary phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Prices Rise Sharply · It is Not Easy to Fall for a While</h3>
<p>Yesterday, caustic soda prices rose sharply because the dyeing and weaving factories in this city purchased a large quantity of it, coupled with various rumors. Firms were hoarding goods and were unwilling to sell them, so the price rose from 300,000 to 500,000 yuan in a week. Recently, people are optimistic, and it is feared that the price will not fall easily for a while. According to a certain foreign firm, soda ash is being distributed, and a large amount of sodium sulfide has arrived at the port, so the price has fallen slightly.</p>
<h3>Sino-US Joint Venture · Large-Scale Electrical Factory</h3>
<p>The National Resources Commission's Central Electrical Equipment Factory's existing equipment is insufficient for its needs. The Japanese electrical factories taken over in Shanghai after the war are also poorly equipped. The factory's general manager, Hui Yintang, traveled from Shanghai to the United States at the end of April to purchase electrical machinery and various electrical raw materials, and to hire technical personnel to come to China to assist in construction. Currently, the factory is cooperating with a large-scale electrical factory in the United States and has signed a contract to establish a large-scale electrical equipment factory in China. In the future, China's various electrical equipment can be manufactured in large quantities and will no longer need to rely on others.</p>
<h3>World Textile Situation Changes · All Countries Need Cotton Textiles Urgently · Giving the United States an Opportunity to Expand Abroad</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Orleans, 6th] Paul Rens, President of the American Textile Exporters Association, wrote in "Southern Textile News" that the world market needs at least 4.5 billion yards of cotton textiles, while only 2.5 billion yards flowed into the world market in 1945. The world textile situation has undergone significant changes in recent years. Japan used to be an important cotton textile exporting country. Before the Pearl Harbor incident, it had a total of 12 million spindles, but now it only has 3 million spindles left. In 1937, the total export value of world cotton textiles was about 6.5 billion yards, of which Japan accounted for more than one-third, the United Kingdom accounted for 1.8 billion yards, and European countries accounted for 1.2 billion yards. In 1937, the United States exported about 200 million yards of cotton textiles. In the near future, the United Kingdom, India, or Japan have no hope of resuming exports. Therefore, it is an unprecedentedly good opportunity for the United States to develop the cotton textile market abroad.</p>
<h3>Silk Goods Continue to Rise · Factory Trading is Still Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the highest spot price for No. 120 Daqiao silk in the morning was 1.32 million yuan, and the lowest was 1.293 million to 1.3 million yuan. There was no change in the afternoon. Mixed brands were all short. Beauty silk was down by 20,000 yuan, and Xuhui silk was down by 10,000 yuan. No. 150 Daqiao silk was down by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The opening price of China Textile Company's goods was similar to the price on Thursday of last week. The Shanghai Uniformity Textile Company had a strong demand for yarn, but there was a shortage of supply. The prices of user yarn and dry yarn have been quite stable in recent days, and trading is still good. The silk goods market was good again yesterday. The morning price for Mayer silk blankets was 1.99 million yuan per hundred, and the bidding price in the afternoon was 3 million yuan, but there were no transactions. The morning price for Dachung checkered crepe was 4,470 yuan per yard, and the afternoon price for deferred delivery was 4,650 yuan.</p>

<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>According to reliable information, 10,000 tons of Taiwan sugar currently stored in Keelung have been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be shipped to Shanghai by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation Management Committee is currently processing the export procedures, and it can be shipped to Shanghai in mid-month.</p>
<p>According to news from relevant parties, Sino-Soviet trade is still sluggish, and there has been no major development recently. Our barter trade with the Soviet Union is still being delivered on a monthly basis. The Soviet Union previously proposed to order 240,000 dan of new and old tea leaves from us, but the offer price was too low, and no agreement has been reached yet.</p>
<p>The Sugar Market Association set the price of medium-grade granulated white sugar at 71,000 yuan to 70,500 yuan. The bid for numbered medium-grade granulated white sugar was 70,500 yuan, but no transaction was made.</p>

<h3>A Comet Shines on a Gloomy Corner: The Chairman and His Wife in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Shenyang is currently in early summer, and the tender green branches and leaves appear particularly lush and lovely. They cover up most of the destruction and incompleteness, and at the same time give people some comfort and vitality.</p>
<p>A rain extinguished the sandstorm and washed away the dust on the streets. People who have spent a spring and even extending into the early summer in sandstorms have a particularly fresh and fulfilling feeling. This seems ordinary to people in the Jiangnan region who are used to "gentle breezes and bright sunshine" and "bright spring sunshine", but it is rare and precious here.</p>
<p>The weather has arranged such a good environment, and the people of Northeast China have thought that this is a sign of the arrival of extraordinary people. Sure enough, a "Meiling" plane carried the Chairman, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, and the newly appointed Minister of National Defense, Bai Chongxi. This happened at 4 p.m. on May 23.</p>
<p>Before the Manchu Dynasty, it was almost unheard of for the head of state of our country to visit the Northeast. Therefore, the arrival of the Chairman and his wife this time is worthy of special mention in the Northeast chapter of Chinese history. What's more, the people of the Great Northeast are eagerly awaiting the Chairman's visit, which is like "hoping for rain in a great drought"!</p>
<h3>National Treasures and Famous Places Light Up Together</h3>
<p>This is a major event after the restoration of the Northeast territory. When the general public learned that the Chairman had arrived, they paid attention to the movements on the streets. Apart from noticing some precautions in certain places, there was no "street cleaning" scene. At the same time, most people saw the Chairman and his accompanying staff in several cars driving into the carriage team, sometimes brushing past crowds. This open and magnanimous demeanor and mind left a very good impression on the people of the Northeast!</p>
<p>The Qing Dynasty palace is located between the Dadong and Daxi city gates. It was built during the "Chongde" reign of Emperor Taizong of the Qing Dynasty, more than 310 years ago. The faded pavilions and terraces are still supporting the momentum of that year. Inside the Great Qing Gate, it is divided into eastern, central, and western parts. The eastern part is the "Dazheng Hall," commonly known as the "Ten Princes Pavilion," where Emperor Taizong and the princes discussed politics. The central part is the "Chongzheng Hall," where the Emperor listened to government affairs. Behind it is the imperial palace. The western part is the famous "Wen Su Ge."</p>
<p>"Wen Su Ge" is one of the "Inner Court Four Pavilions" of the Qing Dynasty for storing the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries. Since the storage of a copy of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries in the forty-eighth year of Qianlong, it has undergone relocation, chaos, copying, and patching for more than sixty years. After the September 18 Incident, the Japanese planned to plunder it to Tokyo twice, but it was finally abandoned due to the efforts of local people. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, the puppet Manchukuo Ministry of Education allocated huge funds to rebuild a two-story new library, which is in line with modern library regulations. The Preparatory Committee lawyer Chen Rongli and relevant people from the Shenyang women's community discussed promoting women's and children's welfare work in the Northeast. They are very willing to support the planned use of the former Japanese consulate staff dormitory to establish kindergartens and nurseries. The garden is large and the environment is excellent, which is very suitable for children to play and rest. Unfortunately, many houses have been damaged and need to be greatly repaired. In the future, after the opening, it may be able to slightly comfort the people of Shenyang for their past admiration and envy of the good education enjoyed by Japanese children. However, the general local people live far away from peaceful areas, and whether their children will have the opportunity to receive education in the future is a question worth studying.</p>
<h3>Abundant Charm of the Tea Party</h3>
<p>In the Shenyang Municipal Government Auditorium, a tea party held on the afternoon of the 27th at 4 o'clock was quite grand in scale. It was a tea party held jointly by the chairman and his wife to entertain people from all walks of life in Shenyang and foreign guests. More than two hundred people attended, including foreign consuls, missionaries, celebrities, Allied soldiers, local gentry, civil and military officials, and journalists. They gathered together, exchanged sentiments, and maintained a very quiet and harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<p>The Chairman and his wife arrived at the venue at 4:15 PM, and everyone stood up and applauded to welcome them. Madam Chiang went to take her seat, and the Chairman, with a warm smile, frequently nodded in response, repeatedly saying, "Please be seated, everyone." Then, he briefly exchanged pleasantries with Bishop Yu Bin and foreign guests nearby, and then tea and refreshments were served. The Chairman occasionally chatted briefly with Director Xiong beside him, while Madam Chiang spoke softly with Vice Chief Bai next to her.</p>
<p>After a short period of time, the Chairman rose to his feet amidst applause and delivered a brief five-minute speech in a somber tone. The Chairman said: "Our compatriots in the Northeast have suffered fourteen years of long-term oppression and suffering. The government has failed to come to their rescue earlier, and we feel extremely regretful. During these fourteen years, I have felt very sad and uneasy in my heart."</p>
<p>"Today, we can only encourage each other, not forget the past suffering, take responsibility, and work together to build the Northeast, to build a new China of the Three Principles of the People after victory, to encourage ourselves and others!" "The United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and other countries among the Allied nations have all come to help us. On the one hand, we are grateful, and on the other hand, we feel deeply regretful, which is that we have not taken up our responsibilities and tasks. From now on, we should all work hard to complete the tasks that we should bear!"</p>
<p>Gentry members such as Zhang Ziwen delivered welcoming speeches, requesting the early restoration of usable factories, improvement of education, relief for the youth, and the designation of Shenyang as a special municipality. The Chairman nodded in agreement to adopt and expedite these matters. When Zhang and others spoke of the suffering they had endured in the past, they were moved to tears. Finally, they stated that the people of the Northeast would surely repay the motherland with their blood and sweat, making the Northeast a strong gateway to the motherland. The Chairman, Madam Chiang, and others were deeply moved.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the Four Dimensions Children's Troupe of the Youth Army's 207th Division presented drama, singing, and performed plays to add to the festive atmosphere. The meeting concluded at around 6 PM. When the Chairman left the municipal government, many people had been waiting outside for a long time, eager to catch a glimpse of the Chairman and his wife's elegance. The Chairman and his wife then ascended to the platform on the second floor of the municipal government to accept cheers and frequently waved to the citizens, who responded with applause. Both sides were filled with boundless bitterness and excitement!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, Talking About Changsha - This Newspaper's Dispatch on the 25th - Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli</h3>
<p>Changsha is being battered by wind and rain, but fortunately, it's not a violent storm, so people are in a relatively cheerful mood. First of all, agriculture needs rain, and this time it's been widespread, so the prospects for the autumn harvest are relatively promising. The grain shortage that has been worrying people for months may be alleviated somewhat as a result. Secondly, the river has risen sharply, making navigation smooth, and the supply of rice is constant. Rice prices in Changsha are continuously falling, and the common people can barely eke out a living. Unfortunately, however, one of the ships carrying flour from the Relief Administration sank downstream due to the wind, but fortunately, the loss was not too great.</p>
<h3>Provincial Assembly Expenses Exceed 100 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>After the rain, everything feels invigorated, and politics is no exception. Take the Changsha Municipal Government, for example: it was established for half a year without doing anything. After the new mayor, Wang Hao, took office, he devoted himself to governing, starting by clearing 200,000 cubic feet of garbage in the city. Naturally, the issue of funds came up first. It was of course impossible to ask the government for money, so he mobilized all the city's citizens to provide labor service. Those who did not provide service were charged 2,500 yuan per day as the cost of hiring laborers. It is expected that all the garbage will be cleared within three months, which is indeed a meritorious act. As the season approaches, the epidemic may improve somewhat.</p>
<p>The Provincial Assembly also held its first session during this period. This was the first popularly elected assembly. The provincial assembly members, elected under fierce competition, numbered seventy-eight. Except for Liu Xingwei from Qiyang who did not arrive, seventy-seven members attended, creating a magnificent and lively scene. After the meeting, the election of the speaker and deputy speaker also reached a fever pitch. Mr. Zhao Yanwu, who had previously served as the speaker of the Provisional Assembly, competed with Zhang Xingfang, the current director of the Provincial Party Headquarters. In the end, Zhao Yanwu won the title again. The position of deputy speaker fell to Mr. Tang Boqiu. Tang is a textile magnate in Hunan and the current director of the Xiangnan No. 1 Textile Factory. He is one of the most eye-catching members of the Assembly. The Assembly session lasted two weeks, during which more than two hundred proposals were discussed, covering a wide range of topics, even including the names of roads in various counties and cities. Zhang Benqing, a county assembly member, said that all road names should only be named after former and contemporary sages, such as Sun Yat-sen as a former sage and the Chairman as a contemporary sage, so names like Boling Road and Boling Bridge should be abolished. The content of other proposals generally focused on the current provincial administration, but lacked unity and creativity. Proposals to seek relief for their respective counties were submitted by every assembly member. Yu Jichuan, the director of the Relief Administration, told reporters yesterday: "Every county wants relief, but which county should be given it? I asked them to propose specific solutions, but none of them could." The assembly members kept saying that they were speaking on behalf of the people, but this session of the Assembly was largely using disaster relief as political capital, as if they would be failing their constituents if they didn't submit proposals to request government relief. Someone estimated that the expenses for the provincial assembly members' elections in various counties and the expenses for this session of the Assembly totaled more than 100 million yuan (of which travel expenses alone amounted to 45 million yuan). If all of it were used to relieve disaster victims, it would be a small but significant supplement, because the emergency agricultural loans allocated by the central government to Hunan were only 1 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Recognize "Saving Lives First" and Devote All Efforts to Urgent Relief</h3>
<p>Speaking of the Hunan disaster, many people used to get a headache just mentioning it. Since President Truman sent Harrison to Hunan to inspect the situation in person, relief supplies have been arriving in a steady stream. The Relief Administration's work is intensifying day by day, and the storage and transportation stations are working around the clock. The situation in southern Hunan, such as Lingling and Qiyang, has improved relatively well, but the situation in Hengyang is becoming increasingly serious. In the urban area, 30,000 people cannot survive without relief, and in the countryside, as many as 300,000 people have no food to eat. The problem is not that rice is expensive or unavailable, but that people have no money to buy it. The Relief Administration and the government are devoting all their efforts to providing urgent relief. Director Yu Weichuan told reporters: "Saving lives is the top priority." All the grain transported by the Administration is being rushed to Hengyang. Each person receives half a catty of wheat flour per day, and some canned goods are also distributed. Originally, it was planned to provide enough for each person for a month, but due to transportation issues, the grain supply is not yet smooth, so each person can only receive half a month's worth first, so that the number of recipients can be increased to reduce the number of deaths.</p>
<p>"If the disaster situation in Hengyang can improve, the Administration plans to do more in terms of post-disaster work. Chairman Wang Dongyuan and Director Yu Jichuan exchanged views on the issue of post-disaster work the day before yesterday. Because Yu had served as the director of the Hunan Provincial Construction Department for many years, he knew the construction work in Hunan very well, so it would be more practical for the Administration to cooperate with the government to carry out post-disaster restoration work. He said: The entire plan is still in the planning stage, and Yu Jichuan does not want to disclose it yet, but to focus on completing the urgent relief work first, but the principles have been determined. First, is transportation and water conservancy. Yu said that western Hunan accounts for the majority of Hunan's land, and its resources are the most abundant, but transportation is too backward and cannot connect with other areas. The Zi River and Yuan River basins in western Hunan are both rich areas, but the lack of water conservancy is also an obstacle to development. Post-disaster work will focus on these aspects and no longer do things that are just icing on the cake. It will start after the urgent relief work is completed."</p>
<h3>Not Only Disaster and Grain Shortages, but Also a Salt Crisis Recently</h3>
<p>However, whether the post-disaster work can begin depends on the autumn harvest situation this year. The provincial government believes that the autumn harvest is one thing, and widely transporting grain to Hunan is another. Waiting for this year's bumper harvest is not only not a solution, but also a long shot. It has also requested and been approved by the central government to allocate an additional 3 billion yuan for the purchase of military grain. This money will be used to purchase grain from outside the province and transport it to Hunan, on the one hand as a reserve of military grain, and on the other hand to stabilize civilian food prices. Coupled with the 400,000 shi of surplus grain from Sichuan and Jiangxi, the phenomenon of grain shortage in Hunan can be improved.</p>
<p>In addition to disaster and grain shortages, Hunan has also recently experienced a salt crisis. Fortunately, the problem was not too big and was resolved soon. The situation was like this: The salt authorities believed that during the war, Sichuan salt was used by the military and civilians in the rear, so production increased and sales expanded. Hunan was originally supplied with Huai salt, but the source of Huai salt was cut off during the war, so it was replaced by Sichuan salt. After the war ended, Huai salt came in a steady stream, and people had not eaten Huai salt for a long time, so they all rushed to buy it, which invisibly caused Sichuan salt to be overstocked. However, the Sichuan salt was purchased by salt merchants with government loans. If no one consumed it, not only would the government lose money, but it would also affect the production in the Sichuan salt region. Therefore, it was stipulated that a certain amount of Sichuan salt should be allocated for sale in the Hunan region every day, but the people were unwilling, saying that the quality of Sichuan salt was not as good as Huai salt and refused to consume it. The salt authorities were quite embarrassed and were criticized by public opinion. Later, after explanations from all parties, it was proven that Sichuan salt and Huai salt were the same, and both had been inspected by the government, so there was no problem with the salt quality. A convenience was also given to the salt merchants, stipulating that for those who purchased more than 50 dan of Sichuan salt from official warehouses, all tax prices were allowed to be paid with bank acceptance drafts or bank-guaranteed term bills, which would be cashed upon maturity. Due to the salt authorities' concessions, the problem was finally resolved.</p>

<h3>About the Sino-American Hospital</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: The Baolong Hospital on Baike Road, Mushishi, was founded by the former Germans. After the victory, it was closed because the German expatriates ceased operations. Later, the Allied American military authorities, recognizing that there were many poor and sick people in the city and that the existing hospitals were not able to accommodate them, suggested that our country's authorities establish a Sino-American Hospital. It was originally run jointly with the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, but is now managed by the Military Commission. All the latest equipment of the hospital is provided by the American side, even down to the blankets on the beds, while the personnel are Chinese. To prevent malfeasance, it was originally planned that all the doctors in the hospital would be full-time. Later, because talent was difficult to find, the heads of each department were changed to part-time positions. Le Wenshao, the former president of the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross (during the puppet regime), was appointed as the medical director, so almost all the heads of the departments who were hired were former employees of the Red Cross Hospital. It was originally scheduled to open on June 1st, but due to insufficient preparation, it may be slightly delayed. However, according to what this writer knows about the inside situation of the hospital, there are a few points that need to be discussed by the hospital's supervisors and the public:</p>
<p>(1) According to the allocation ratio of beds in various public hospitals in Shanghai, such as the Red Cross, Tongren, and Renji hospitals, third-class beds account for at least 60% of all beds. Because there are many poor people in society, even with so many third-class beds, they are still full every day, and it is very difficult to find one. However, the Sino-American Hospital has determined that third-class beds will only account for 20% of all beds, which is greatly contrary to the original intention of the Allied authorities to sincerely help our poor and sick compatriots!</p>
<p>(2) Although the hospital has not yet opened, the department heads, taking advantage of their part-time positions, have already organized a joint clinic in the ×× pharmaceutical factory near the hospital, the Polb Cnic. It is composed of Le Wenshao (internal medicine), Ren Tinggui and Shao Youshan (surgery), Zhou Chenghu (ophthalmology), Fang Kan (tuberculosis), and Mu Ruifen (otolaryngology). Their intention is nothing more than to follow the old practice of the doctors of the former Baolong Hospital, to solicit wealthy patients from the hospital nearby (which is why there are so many doctors on Baike Road and Chengdu Road) to their private clinics. Therefore, the reason why the hospital plans to have so few third-class beds can also be understood from this!</p>
<p>(3) The hospital is currently being actively prepared. The internal equipment assisted by the Allied forces is sophisticated and plentiful. Although it has not yet been put into practical use, a lot of leakage and disappearance has already occurred! From this, we can see that the intention of our Allied friends to help us and the original intention of our authorities to run the hospital are good, but due to the self-interest of the medical personnel in charge (the director is said to be an amateur), the actual benefits that the poor and sick people of Shanghai will receive in the future are questionable. Wang Yunxun, May 30th.</p>
<h3>Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>— The Colleagues of the Superior Physician Society</p>
<p>In the past ten years, scientific medicine has been more widely accepted by society than before. Scientific medicine, which was previously only recognized and enjoyed by a small number of intellectuals, has now gradually penetrated the masses. This progress, on the one hand, has unfolded the dawn of national health, and on the other hand, has given great encouragement to us, a group of medical and health workers.</p>
<p>In our work experience, we feel that there is still a need for more understanding and cooperation between us medical and health workers and the society we serve in order to achieve our common goal - to eradicate disease and enhance human health and happiness. Here, we can explain our position a little more.</p>
<p>(1) Most people only go to the doctor when they are sick, and even then, only when the illness is serious. However, the goal of modern medicine is not limited to the narrow definition of "treatment," but emphasizes preventing disease before it occurs, in order to enjoy the happiness of health. This is what is called "preventive medicine." The highest ideal of us medical and health workers is to eliminate all kinds of diseases. The implementation of preventive medicine is a public health work, and it is not enough to rely solely on doctors, nor is it enough to rely solely on public health personnel. The most important thing is the cooperation of the whole people. How to obtain this most important cooperation is what we must strive to pursue.</p>
<p>(2) Although scientific medicine has a history of several decades in China, due to the backwardness of culture, traditional medicine and witch doctors who beg for help from gods and ghosts are still ubiquitous. Although these phenomena will disappear after a considerable period of time, too many people are dying unjustly and the losses are too great. Therefore, in addition to promoting scientific medicine, we must also help the public to break superstitions and metaphysical claims.</p>
<p>Based on the above positions, we have opened this special column. Here we do not introduce which doctor treats which disease, or which disease should be treated with which product of which company. These are not our concerns. We will gradually introduce the concept of scientific medicine and effective methods for preventing disease and maintaining health.</p>
<p>Under our sacred mission, we will do our best to fight for human health. This special column is a bridge between us and the public. Although the space is small, the aspirations are grand. We deeply hope that our colleagues will join us and that all sectors of society will provide guidance. Then the colleagues will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>The Pathogen of Cholera</h3>
<p>— Yang Shuya</p>
<p>True cholera is an acute infectious disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Its origin is the Ganges Delta in India. Since 1817, it has spread around the world through sea and land transportation. At that time, the medical community did not know what its pathogen was. It was not until 1883 that Robert Koch, the president of the research association organized by the German government, went to Egypt and India to conduct on-the-spot investigations. He personally examined the feces of many cholera patients and dissected the intestines of those who died from the disease. Under the microscope, he discovered a unique curved bacterium, and rigorous scientific experiments proved that it was the pathogen of cholera. He then named it Vibrio cholerae. Later, after research by bacteriologists from various countries, it was also confirmed that Koch's discovery was correct.</p>
<p>The Vibrio cholerae is very small (only 1.5×3 μm) and cannot be seen without a microscope. However, it multiplies extremely rapidly in the human body and produces toxins, which often lead to serious diseases - cholera. Cholera patients spread the bacteria to the outside world through vomiting and diarrhea. Feces and vomit contain the bacteria, and water, food, flies, etc. contaminated by them can also have their traces. Because of its small size, people cannot see it and do not know how to prevent it. Its harm to humans is even greater than that of poisonous snakes and beasts.</p>
<p>Vibrio cholerae is very ferocious, but it cannot withstand heat. All bacteria contained in food and drinks can be killed by boiling them. Chemical substances such as lime milk and bleaching powder can also kill the bacteria, so they can be used to disinfect feces and vomit.</p>
<h3>Symptoms of Cholera</h3>
<p>— Dai Ziying</p>
<p>The period from when food or drink contaminated with cholera bacteria enters the body to the onset of symptoms is very short, ranging from a few hours to five or six days. This is the incubation period. During an epidemic, the severity of the symptoms varies depending on the individual's resistance, the number of bacteria, the acidity of the gastric juice, and the season. Mild symptoms may include mild diarrhea, occasional vomiting, and mild collapse, which will heal in one or two days. Severe symptoms may include dry cholera, which can cause death within a few hours of onset, before diarrhea and vomiting have even occurred, due to severe toxicity. Common general symptoms can be roughly divided into three stages.</p>
<p>(1) Initial Stage: May or may not occur. Those with milder symptoms often have one or two days of mild diarrhea, accompanied by symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, and mental fatigue. The stool is a yellow liquid.</p>
<p>(2) Dehydration Stage: Lasts from about two or three hours to twenty-four hours. The symptoms in this stage can be summarized as being caused by dehydration in the body. During this stage, the number of diarrheal episodes increases sharply, followed by frequent vomiting, which can occur dozens of times in an hour. The patient's eyeballs are sunken, the cheeks are emaciated, the bridge of the nose is high, the voice is hoarse, the breathing is short, the lips are dry, the pulse is fast and weak, the skin is cyanotic and cold, the leg muscles are cramped, and the fingertips are wrinkled. Some of these are commonly referred to as "hanging foot sha" and "deflated snail sha," which are not different from ordinary cholera, but are a deeper manifestation of dehydration. The amount of urine is extremely reduced or even completely absent. The skin loses its inherent elasticity. If the skin on the back of the hand is pinched with two fingers and lifted up, the skin of a normal person will return to its original state after being released, but this is not the case for patients. It will remain raised for a long time before slowly returning. During this stage, the patient may die due to the worsening of the symptoms and entering a coma, or the condition may improve and enter the recovery stage. Without proper treatment, the mortality rate is about 40%. During the collapse stage, the stool has a unique rice-water appearance or is a grayish-white precipitate. This is because it no longer contains feces and is composed purely of protein, mucus, cholera bacteria, and epithelial bacteria.</p>
<p>(3) Reaction Stage: About half or more of the patients enter this stage. During this stage, the frequency of bowel movements and vomiting decreases sharply, or even constipation occurs. The skin changes from cyanotic to ruddy, and the voice changes from hoarse to loud. Body temperature rises, and breathing and heart function gradually return to normal. There are no more muscle cramps or wrinkled fingertips. The most important thing is the restoration of kidney function, so that urine excretion returns to normal. If this is the case, good health can be expected soon. Otherwise, the patient will return to a dangerous state, entering a state similar to typhoid fever, and dying of uremic coma (the mortality rate of uremia is 15%).</p>
<h3>Actions That Should Be Taken by Families After Cholera Occurs</h3>
<p>— Wang Linsheng</p>
<p>(1) Immediately escort the patient to the nearest cholera hospital or epidemic prevention hospital for diagnosis and treatment. This is because the treatment of this disease requires rapid intravenous injection of saline to replenish the body's water and dilute the toxins of the bacteria. At this critical moment in the patient's life, do not try using secret recipes or over-the-counter medicines to harm yourself.</p>
<p>(2) The patient's excrement (including feces and vomit, etc.) and clothing are all attached with cholera bacteria, which is a major hazard in the transmission of cholera. They should be disinfected strictly and promptly to prevent new cases from arising. The house and bed where the patient lives should also be washed and sprinkled with lime water to curb its spread. The person who does the washing must be careful to prevent contracting the disease. Do not put your fingers in the water.</p>
<p>(3) Flies are one of the vectors for spreading cholera and should be killed. It is best to spray them with a reliable DDT solution, and especially eliminate their breeding grounds. Food should be protected and not exposed to flies.</p>
<p>(4) If a family member unfortunately dies of cholera, the corpse should be covered with a cloth soaked in a 20-fold solution of carbolic acid and placed in a tightly sealed coffin. The burial should be simple and public mourning should be prohibited. Cremation is best if possible.</p>
<p>(5) Since cholera is a disease that enters through the mouth, raw water, unclean fruits, and raw vegetables should not be eaten casually. Hands must be washed before meals. Careless drinking and eating are also factors that induce the transmission of this disease and should be avoided.</p>
<p>(6) If there are suspected patients, they should be immediately sent to the hospital for diagnosis, treatment, and isolation, so as not to delay treatment for oneself or spread the disease to others. It benefits both oneself and others, so why not do it?</p>
<p>(7) Family members who have not yet been vaccinated should go to medical and health authorities as soon as possible to receive preventive injections.</p>
<h3>Saltwater Injections and Other Treatments for Cholera</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changshao</p>
<p>The most important treatment for cholera is administering saltwater injections. Of course, some doctors also prefer to administer various expensive injectable medications, such as heart stimulants, which are naturally very expensive, but not necessarily essential. The latest methods also employ sulfonamide drugs, but if saltwater injections are not administered and only sulfonamide drugs are used, it is not only ineffective but also harmful. Therefore, among all cholera treatments, saltwater injections are the most important and indispensable.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, blood is the most precious substance in the body. The nutrients required by every cell in the body must be supplied directly or indirectly by the blood. The waste products that cells do not need must also be collected and eliminated by the blood. However, blood must be a flowing liquid to circulate throughout the body and perform its functions. Cholera patients experience vomiting and diarrhea, losing a large amount of water from their bodies. As a result, the blood becomes thick and circulation fails. This is the most dangerous symptom of cholera patients. A small number of cholera patients, even if they do not vomit or have diarrhea, can experience the same result if the water in their blood flows into their tissues. This "dehydration" phenomenon is the most important pathological phenomenon of cholera and the main cause of death from cholera. It must be corrected immediately in treatment. Administering saltwater injections is currently the only known effective method.</p>
<p>By injecting saltwater into the veins, the water lost within the body can be replenished, restoring its normal fluidity, and circulation can be restored accordingly. As a result, many symptoms of cholera, such as sunken eyes, cramps, loss of voice, and collapse, which are signs of impending death, quickly disappear. However, vomiting and diarrhea sometimes do not stop. If vomiting and diarrhea persist, water continues to be lost, so saltwater injections must be continued every few hours until there is no longer a significant loss of water.</p>
<p>However, administering saltwater injections is not an easy procedure. The preparation of saltwater must be based on the latest scientific principles and employ strict techniques; otherwise, various reactions may occur after the injection, and these reactions can sometimes be life-threatening. Saltwater injections also need to be administered by well-trained personnel to ensure that the injection rate and dosage are neither excessive nor insufficient.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been discovered that ordinary water contains a pyrogen, called Progen in English. Even distilled water, chemicals, and ordinary glassware often contain this substance. If saltwater and other injectable medications contain this substance, intravenous injection often causes various reactions such as chills, fever, headache, and vomiting, sometimes endangering life. Ordinary sterilization methods cannot eliminate this pyrogen. In the past, distilled water and saltwater on the market contained a large amount of pyrogen, so reactions occurred after saltwater injections. Now, a special method has been invented to remove pyrogens from the water. Therefore, it is hoped that pharmacies will provide pyrogen-free distilled water and hospitals will use pyrogen-free saltwater to reduce the suffering and danger to patients.</p>
<p>Secondly, most cholera patients not only have "dehydration," but also "acidosis." Therefore, they not only need saltwater but also alkaline components. In the past, this point was often overlooked, so patients often died of acidosis after being saved from dehydration. Adding alkaline components to saltwater is not simple. Sodium bicarbonate is naturally a good alkaline component, but it cannot be sterilized by ordinary methods after being added. If sodium lactate is used, the preparation method is relatively easier.</p>
<p>Previously, there were reports in the United States and our country of using sulfonamide drugs to treat cholera. Before using sulfonamides, saltwater injections must first be administered to replenish the water in the blood and restore kidney function; otherwise, serious reactions are likely to occur. The use of sulfonamides may reduce the mortality rate of cholera. The best sulfonamide currently known is sulfathiazole.</p>
<h3>Beware of Cholera: Disease Enters Through the Mouth!!!</h3>
<p>— Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>The terrifying cholera, also known as "tiger cholera," has reappeared this year!</p>
<p>"Turning pale at the mention of a tiger" is not necessary. We need to investigate: how does this cholera come about? What methods are there to defeat it?</p>
<p>"Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." What is cholera all about? It turns out that the feces and vomit of cholera patients (or carriers) contain countless cholera vibrios. These vibrios, through some route of transmission—water, food, flies, fingers, tableware, etc.—enter the mouths of other people and cause illness in their stomachs. These people then become patients and can infect others. If this spreads rapidly, the death toll will be staggering.</p>
<p>Now that we have investigated the origins and paths of cholera, we do not need to worry about not having strategies to deal with it. There are three strategies: First, "eliminate the enemy where it comes from." Cholera vibrios come from the feces or vomit of patients, so we must thoroughly disinfect the feces and vomit to prevent cholera vibrios from escaping. This is the best policy, most thorough, most effective, and most important. What method can be used to disinfect? The most convenient and reliable method is to immediately add an equal amount of lime (lump lime) to the feces or vomit, mix it thoroughly, and then pour it into a deep pit or bury it in the soil. If bleaching powder is available, it is even better than lime. Are there cholera patients in your house or your neighbor's house? If not, please raise your awareness and pay close attention. Once there is a cholera patient, then please quickly use the above method to disinfect the feces and disinfect the vomit. This basic step is not too troublesome and concerns your own life and safety, so please do not be careless.</p>
<p>However, it is not certain that every patient's family will disinfect in this way, and it is not certain that everyone will do it perfectly. Perhaps cholera vibrios have already invaded your drinking water, invaded your food, attached to the feet of flies, or attached to your tableware or fingers. What should be done? Therefore, we must also adopt the second strategy—cut off their transmission routes.</p>
<p>What routes should be cut off? First, water is the most important. If disinfected tap water is available, that is good. If river water or well water is used, then the water source should be strictly protected to prevent pollution. In any case, it is absolutely forbidden to drink raw water, and it is also forbidden to wash fruits with raw water or use raw water to rinse bowls or gargle. In short, everything that is drunk, eaten, or used that enters the mouth must be boiled water to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Secondly, food that contains raw water, such as sour plum soup, Dutch water, and jelly, should not be eaten. Even other things must be eaten cooked. Melon slices or food that flies have passed over may carry attached cholera vibrios. Fingertips touching this and that may also carry bacteria. In the final analysis, you must be careful about what you put in your mouth and not allow any food or drink that may carry cholera vibrios to enter your mouth. As the saying goes, "Disease enters through the mouth." If you guard this important port, cholera vibrios cannot attack from the skin or the orifices of the eyes, ears, nose, or mouth.</p>
<p>If the above articles can be strictly implemented, you can rest easy. However, human society has frequent contact, and general environmental hygiene is very lacking. During this cholera epidemic, a slight carelessness can lead to infection. Therefore, the last line of defense should also be adopted, which is the third strategy for dealing with cholera.</p>
<p>The third strategy is preventative inoculation—getting vaccinated—to enhance our body's ability to resist cholera vibrios. This is called "immunity." It means that if a small amount of cholera vibrios invades the human body, the body of a person who has been vaccinated can resist it, with the hope of defeating the bacteria and avoiding the epidemic. However, all immunity in the world is relative. You must not rely on having been vaccinated and think that you are insured. Reckless eating and drinking are still dangerous.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, cholera, as an infectious disease, is absolutely preventable. In civilized countries in Europe and America, cholera has long been eradicated. In China, it occurs once every two or three years, and the cities with deaths are becoming more and more crowded. This must be considered a great shame for the nation.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Rong Case</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The Rong Desheng case was resolved with more than 300,000 US dollars, which can be confirmed by the emergency order issued by the police yesterday to pay attention to the serial numbers of the US dollar bills printed by the police.</p>
<p>We have two thoughts about this incident:</p>
<p>First, the Rong family did not cooperate with the public security authorities; second, the public security authorities failed to handle the matter impartially.</p>
<p>During the period from Rong Desheng's kidnapping to his release and return, his contacts and negotiations with the bandits were kept secret. The public security authorities not only failed to obtain any reference information or clues from the Rong family, but were misled by many mysteries, and even deceived into announcing that Rong's escape from the bandits' den was due to the bandits being forced by police detectives to release him automatically, without paying any price;</p>
<p>The public security authorities naturally did not want to be partial and sing the same tune as the Rong family. They stopped pursuing the matter because they were afraid of hurting the rats while throwing stones at the china. However, after a prominent person spoke out, they had to relax a step and did not punish the Rong family for sheltering the bandits in accordance with the law, which we regret very much.</p>
<p>As a result, the bandits are still at large.</p>
<p>If the course of events was exactly the opposite of the above, I am afraid that not only would the Rong case criminals be apprehended sooner, but those who commit crimes in the future would not dare to try it so easily.</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of Mo Guokang, Concubine of the Traitor Chen Gongbo</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ming</p>
<p>"If a traitor is a woman, she must be overwhelmingly charming, with sensual and fleshy curves," everyone thinks. Therefore, the first female traitor tried by the Capital High Court became the target of everyone's aspirations.</p>
<p>She did not have a husband and had never been formally married, but she was the concubine of the traitor Chen Gongbo. Naturally, in terms of sentiment and reason, there would inevitably be some scandalous history involved.</p>
<p>Imagine how attractive this topic was! Therefore, the Capital High Court on the 3rd was like a wedding, with throngs of people from the courtyard to the courtroom. Among them were also some compatriots who stayed in the occupied area, who had endured the humiliation under the power of the invaders. Today, they came out of excitement, wanting to see her "have such a day too"!</p>
<p>When the judges took their seats, Mo Guokang was also escorted in. Naturally, the first impression was a bit abrupt, because she was not only not monstrous, but also not charming. She was wearing a neatly ironed light blue printed Dan cloth gown, a pair of black flat leather shoes, her hair was not permed, it was short, her face was clearly southern, her eyes were bright and piercing, her skin was slightly dark, and she was extremely calm and natural when she entered the court.</p>
<p>When her experience was questioned, the first question that was touched on was her relationship with Chen, the traitor. The judge questioned her in various ways, but did not say directly, "When did you become Chen's concubine?" So she kept evading, saying things like "We have a teacher-student relationship," "I took care of him," and so on. When asked when she met Chen, she quickly said, "Between 1924 and 1926." How did they meet? "He was once my teacher. At the same time, he followed Mr. Liao Zhongkai and participated in the National Revolution, and often went in and out of Mr. Liao's residence. I also often went to Mr. Liao's residence, so I met him." Therefore, later "I took care of him," "did some private things for him." In short, very casually, very subtly, Mo Guokang became Chen's concubine.</p>
<p>When asked how she went to Nanjing, she said: "At the end of April 1939, because Guangzhou was lost and my family was scattered, I wanted to go back to find my family, so I went to Shaoguan to Hong Kong and lived there for eleven months. During that period, I read and wrote literary works, which introduced the anti-Japanese war in the front."</p>
<p>Why did she go to Nanjing again? She said: "Mr. Chen asked me to come. Originally, Mr. Chen was not willing to, but because Mr. Wang insisted that he go, he had no choice but to go. Because I was used to taking care of Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen wanted me to go, and I had no choice but to go."</p>
<p>"I went to Shanghai in early April and stayed for a few days before going to Nanjing. At that time, Chen was already the President of the Legislative Yuan, and I went in to be an editor." "From October 1940, I became a member of the Legislative Yuan until the Nanjing government was dissolved."</p>
<p>"The facts about the Political Security Department are like this: I started working at the department in April 1945, first as a counselor, and later I was ordered to work in the confidential office." When asked if she was acting for Chen, the Director-General, she said, "Absolutely not. I mostly helped him with his private affairs. I do not review official documents, and I am a weak woman who is often sick, how can I do these things? Later, I left the Political Security Department because of my poor health."</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, which were passed by the puppet Legislative Yuan and harmed China, she said: "I did not participate in the parliament. At the same time, it was submitted by the Central Political Committee, and it was specified that not a single word could be changed, so the Legislative Yuan was not responsible. As for the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, I was unhappy when I saw the word 'Manchukuo'." She said it so well that everyone should believe her lies.</p>
<p>The Presiding Judge asked her, "Do you know that these treaties would lead to the destruction of China?" She said, "I have not studied them, and I have not expressed my approval."</p>
<p>Then, she repeatedly stated that she did not go to Tokyo to "escape punishment," but because Chen went to Japan. "I was used to taking care of him, and the situation in Nanjing was very chaotic at that time. Mr. Chen was afraid that I would be in danger, so he asked me to go with him, and I went."</p>
<p>Naturally, Mo Guokang, who was standing on the defendant's stand, did not know that Chen had already been executed in Suzhou that morning. So when the Presiding Judge asked her, "Chen Gongbo has been sentenced to death, what are your thoughts?" She laughed and pretended to be so nonchalant, and said, "My thought is that he sacrificed himself for his friends." She was still defending Chen.</p>
<p>She was a member of the puppet Legislative Yuan and the Director of the Confidential Office of the puppet Political Security Department. She exercised the powers of the Director-General of the Political Security Department, Chen, a traitor. The Political Security Department was a special agent organization. She denied: "I have not handled official business for Mr. Chen, I only did private things for him." She also said: "I look at official documents, but do not approve them." Why did she have to look at them? She said, "Because the special agents and Mr. Chen have nothing to do with each other, so I have to go in and take a look for him." At first, she denied not understanding that the department was a special agent organization, and now she confessed it herself. In the end, she also submitted an official document, which was submitted to Chen by her, saying that this could prove that I did not "decide on behalf of him."</p>
<p>There is also a contradictory point in the confession, that is, at first, she said that she worked in the Legislative Yuan in order to earn a salary to maintain her life, but when asked what rank she was paid at, she denied: "I have never received a salary, really, I have never received a salary." Then this means that I did not personally handle the official payment, but as the concubine of the Director-General, it was certainly convenient to withdraw money at any time.</p>
<p>When asked if she was married, she said, "I am not married." Everyone laughed, but she was very serious!</p>
<p>Finally, she still boasted about her achievements. First, she said, "I have always adhered to two principles: one is not to criticize the anti-Japanese war, because I agree with the anti-Japanese war; one is not to criticize the supreme leader, and at the same time to assist the comrades who are sent from the rear to work in Nanjing and Shanghai." After this, she gave many examples, such as Chen Lin of the Military Intelligence Bureau, Wu Huaqun of the Third War Zone, anyway, it was all unverifiable, a debt out of nowhere. It's always good to talk about it. She also talked about relieving the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>This set of traitor theory lasted for more than ten minutes, and she spoke with laughter, her attitude was quite "that."</p>
<p>Regarding the indictment, she argued with several points: (1) Various regulations and treaties were sent by the Central Political Committee and could only be passed without the right to change them, especially the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, which was designated not to change a single word. (2) Regarding the alleged acting for the Director-General of the Political Security Department, Mr. Chen never asked for leave, there was no need to act for him, and I am a woman who is often sick, how can I act as the Director-General? (3) Going to Japan was because I had been taking care of Mr. Chen for many years, and Mr. Chen asked me to go, I could not refuse, it was not to escape punishment. (4) Contacting anti-Japanese war comrades and relieving the suffering of the people were all facts.</p>
<p>"I have not done anything that is detrimental to the country, detrimental to the people, or detrimental to the anti-Japanese war."</p>
<p>"To be a friend to the end,"</p>
<p>And she smiled very reluctantly.</p>
<p>Thus, the court announced that the verdict would be pronounced at 10 a.m. on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Snake</h3>
<p>— Translated by Bao Zhiying</p>
<p>Mine Clearance Device</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Operations Department recently announced a new type of weapon called the "Snake." This weapon was used extensively by the Allied forces on the European battlefield to clear many mines buried by the Axis forces, allowing tank units to enter enemy positions without danger.</p>
<p>The "Snake" is a metal, narrow, linear container with two flat, linear, explosive fuse gates wrapped between curved aluminum plates. After being screwed together, it can be pushed forward by light or medium tanks to detonate landmines. The weapon is 400 feet long, 14 inches wide, and 5 inches high, weighing approximately 9,000 pounds, but half of the load is the weight of high explosives.</p>
<p>The "Snake" has a chisel-like nose at the front, guiding its narrow body through rugged roads or mountains. Oval-shaped special ammunition is placed inside the narrow device, each spaced approximately two and a half feet apart. The machine gun fire from the advancing tank can ignite the fuse and cause an explosion.</p>
<p>To avoid competitive destruction, this weapon is mostly used at night. The "Snakes," operating in large numbers in the fields, are disguised and protected by grass and sandbags, and advance at a rate of two miles per hour.</p>

<h3>Comic Strip: Sanmao Joins the Army (Twenty-Five)</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Leping</p>
<p>News Small World</p>
<h3>Candle Rice Merchant, No Light, No Bright</h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>The food loan that has been causing a stir in the city, its wide-ranging involvement, its scope, and the tortuous and strange nature of the case, have many things that cannot be told to outsiders.</p>
<p>Wu Rongsheng, the manager of San Tai Rice Shop, is currently being detained in a military organization in the western district, and is not allowed to meet with his family. Even the food sent by his family must be sent to the hospital for testing before being allowed to be eaten. It is said that there are two reasons for this: first, it is feared that after meeting with his family, he will "leak secrets," "seek avenues," "make gestures," and cause changes in the middle. Second, it is feared that poison will be placed in the food to commit suicide and create a "headless case."</p>
<p>It is also heard that Wu Rongsheng once asked a prominent person and a rice industry tycoon to request bail, but was rejected.</p>
<p>In addition to rice shops, many "companies with strong backing" that are suspected of being involved in this food loan are being investigated. The company of a certain young master is mostly involved in buying and selling short, so there is no concrete evidence to investigate. However, the evidence against Changjiang Company is conclusive, so there are three people, including the manager Wang Xunzhi, who have been detained.</p>
<p>When the government repeatedly stated its determination to stabilize food prices, rice merchants mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, thinking that they could still get away with it. After the Changjiang Company incident, they realized that the government's actions this time were not just talk, and seeing that the military organization was also assisting in the investigation, they knew that they were facing a life-and-death situation. As a result, the rice merchants became fearful, and the price of rice automatically trended downwards. The Shanghai people say "candle opener, no light, no bright," which is a fitting description.</p>
<p>Shi Licheng, the chairman of the Securities Industry Association, recently commented on the fact that American goods are suddenly cheaper than domestic goods, believing that this unbalanced situation is like "a broken game of Go, becoming one-sided," and his words were full of sadness.</p>
<p>Song Hanzhang's deafness and Bei Songsun's lameness can be called the two wonders of the Chinese financial world. Bei's way of doing things has the style of an entrepreneur, not perfunctory, no official airs, handling finances, reviewing official documents, the brain and hand are in sync, and the decisions are quick, so the subordinates are all convinced.</p>
<p>A Collection of Brief Remarks</p>
<h3>Special Commissioner vs. Tea Boy</h3>
<p>— Wuling Person</p>
<p>All the staff of the Shanghai Office of the Executive Yuan submitted a letter to Director Jiang, generally saying that all the staff would rather be tea boys than special commissioners or section chiefs. The reason is that the monthly income of the staff is only more than 100,000 yuan, while the salary of the tea boys is calculated according to the cost of living index, reaching more than 200,000 yuan per month. In this case, the Dragon Boat Festival bonus, which cannot be avoided this time, seems to have to be reversed, fortunately, there is no longer any talk of superiority and inferiority in front of us.</p>
<p>Among the members of the Association of Comrades in Distress, there is Yin Dingyi, who was reported as a traitor and prosecuted after investigation confirmed the suspicion of crime and the court opened for interrogation. During the trial, Yin's wife presented the certificate of the Association of Comrades in Distress as evidence that membership requires qualification review, and the prosecutor's prosecution must also be investigated in advance; Is this the confusion of the qualification reviewers of the Association of Comrades in Distress, or is the prosecutor's prosecution improper? Let's see in the future.</p>
<p>The traitors in the "Loyalty" prison received gifts from their families as usual during the Dragon Boat Festival, and enjoyed seasonal delicacies. At the same time, more than 200 righteous people are asking the authorities for relief.</p>
<p>A large number of Japanese aircraft, which have been piled up in the Jiang Airport for a long time and eroded by wind, rain and scorching sun, are no longer in shape, will be dismantled and sold by the kilogram. The United States also has a large number of bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, etc. that will be sold as scrap iron. Is this a symbol of world peace, turning hostility into friendship?</p>
<p>Living in Chongqing is full of resentment, returning to Shanghai is full of suffering, being an official can make a fortune, doing business can also make a fortune, you always have to think of a way, can't you just starve to death here?</p>
<h3>Democratic Bra</h3>
<p>— Zisu</p>
<p>A certain gentleman completed a cartoon, which is a half-naked lady with a bra on her chest; On the bra, the words "democracy" were written, and the title was "Miss Democracy, you are having romantic luck!"</p>
<p>Some people criticized him for being immoral, because democracy is not a "romantic luck" lady, nor is it a prostitute who sells her body.</p>
<p>But in my opinion, it is quite thought-provoking. People take food as their heaven, let alone in this era of rice as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, when babies are waiting to be fed, the first thing they ask for from their mothers is of course breast milk. Although the American-made "Kerning milk powder" is everywhere now, milk powder is always not as good as breast milk, and the price of milk powder is not very cheap. After all, only rich people are worthy of enjoying it. In the eyes of poor boys, it is a luxury, so they are looking forward to breast milk even more! We hope that the arrival of democracy is as urgent as an infant waiting to be fed!</p>
<p>It is a pity that there is still a pair of bras covering democracy, which is hoped for but unattainable. I don't know when we will have democratic milk to suck, so that "Kerning milk powder" will not be available on the market. Borrowing an old poem, this is exactly called "I always feel a layer of soul". We are still some distance away from true democracy. How can we not feel "disappointed" by this "beautiful figure"?</p>
<p>We don't want Miss Democracy to have romantic luck and become a private plaything; We want to protect her, help her drive away mad bees and wild butterflies, and hope that she will become everyone's mother, so that we can all have milk to eat! (Editor's note: The painting was published in the eleventh issue of the "Xinwen Tiandi" monthly magazine)</p>

<h3>Reply to Readers: Legal Questions</h3>
<p>Loyal Reader asks Editor: There is A (male) who was engaged to B (female) before the War of Resistance Against Japan. When the war broke out, A was trapped due to his job and moved west to Chengdu with the agency. B lived in the seaside area. Due to environmental and economic reasons, A could not go to B's place to get married, and B was the same. After a few years, B stayed in her boudoir for a long time and is now thirty-three years old. However, it was found that A actually married C (female) in Chengdu in the last few years and had children. Recently, A has come to Shanghai and denied that he married C, and intends to marry B. Now there are several questions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A married C without marrying B. Is there any violation of the law? Is it bigamy? Which article of which law is violated? Please record the original text. (2) A has not terminated the engagement with B, and officially married C. Does C have any legal status? Is C legal? (3) If A does not break off the relationship with C, but denies to B that there is C, and then marries B, is A guilty of bigamy? Does C have the right to sue? (4) If A does not break off the relationship with C, but only denies to B that there is C, and then marries B, what will be the relationship between B and C in the future? Who is the eldest? Or who is the eldest? Because B was engaged first, she should be regarded as the original wife, and C married first, and can also be regarded as priority? (5) How many years of cohabitation between men and women can be legally recognized as husband and wife? (6) Assuming that the length of cohabitation between A and C has reached the legal requirements and can be considered as husband and wife, then what is B's status? (7) Now A denies that there is C. If he marries B, and then C appears, what is C's legal status and rights? (8) If the other party has bigamy, within how many years should the victim file a lawsuit? During the period of traffic interruption and communication difficulties, before the facts have been confirmed, is this time limit valid? (9) B is now old and cannot be self-sufficient. If A is obstructed by C and does not marry B, B will be greatly harmed. If the engagement has not been married for a long time, has A violated the law? Which law is violated? Is B called abandoned? What legal rights does B have? Can she request compensation and alimony, etc.? (10) How is the current fee calculated? Is it based on the cost of living index? (11) A conceals that he is married to C and is willing to marry B. What legal procedures should B go through before she can marry A? And what legal procedures can make the relationship between C and A invalid? Or make it a natural severance of the relationship, without legal effect?</p>
<p>Please answer the above points in detail.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin's reply] (1) A does not constitute the crime of bigamy, but B can legally terminate the engagement with A and request compensation. (2) If A and C's marriage has a public ceremony and two or more witnesses, C is A's legal spouse. (3) If A marries B again, he will be guilty of bigamy, and C has the right to sue. (4) C should be recognized as the legal spouse, and interested parties may request the revocation of B and A's marriage. (5) There is no such provision in the law. (6) If A and C only have cohabitation facts and have not held a public ceremony, then the marital relationship between A and C cannot be recognized as established according to law. A can still marry B without committing bigamy. (7) It should be judged based on whether A and C are formally married or only in a cohabitation relationship. (8) The crime of bigamy in Article 237 of the Criminal Law is a crime that can only be prosecuted upon complaint. It can be prosecuted before the statute of limitations for prosecution has expired (the statute of limitations for prosecution of this crime is ten years). (9) A does not constitute the crime of abandonment. A and B are not married yet, and B cannot request alimony, but B can legally claim to terminate the engagement with A and request compensation for damages. (10) There is no fixed standard for the calculation of the amount of compensation for damages. It is determined by the court based on the parties' request. (11) If A and C are only in a cohabitation relationship, they are ultimately not husband and wife. If A and C are formally married, there is no way to break away except for divorce.</p>
