<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕今日還都專機續到十架，內載立法監察兩院，軍委會，中央黨部，農林部，海外部等職員三百餘人。</p>
<p>〔中央社成都廿六日電〕蔣主席廿六日上午十時牛，在軍校大操塲召集成都各陸空軍學校官生訓話，到陸軍軍官學校。空軍參謀學校。空軍軍官學校。空軍通訊學校。空軍機械學校。官生及空軍三路司令部官佐七千餘人，蔣主席勉彼等力求精神之革新，生活之整飭，學問技術之進步，以期不愧爲現代軍人，完成建軍。建國使命。訓話畢，川省府主席張羣，亦作簡單講話，勉彼等效法蔣主席大智大仁大勇精神，以寗靜忍耐堅定三種修養，祖當革命重任，完成革命使命。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕重慶訊，政府還都後軍事委員會即將改組爲國防部，設參謀總長一人，陸空海軍及後勤部各分設司令一人，聞此項改組計劃，正由何總長白副總長陳誠部長等籌劃中。陳誠部長廿六日晨自滬乘車抵京。</p>
<h3>和平會商獲進展　東北停戰新協定傳將成立　馬歇爾氏改定下週初來京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕重慶訊，蔣主席馬歇爾特使行期決定後，擾攘七月有餘兎起騰落之政局，業隨還都高潮急轉直下，聞中共及民主同盟昨已決定派人來京覓屋，中共重慶紅岩村之辦事處已準備結束，美方已表示將以最優惠之運輸工具，協助搬塲。聞靑年黨在京已覓定辦公住所，並聞政府對各在野黨均將予以居住之便利，時局可能因搬塲而好轉。今晚曾有一國大職業代表某君笑語記者曰，在南京或廬山談政治，可以開拓視界，舒展心胸，增强聽覺，因遭勝利苦難的小百姓，呻吟哀號之聲，惟有走米東南，聽來倍覺切。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿六日電〕消息靈通之觀察家今日以爲，停止東北內戰之新協定，有於週末成立之可能性。馬歇爾特使自美返此後，即與政府官史以及重要國共人員進行會商，頃已展緩其赴京日期至下週初，此點使各方猜測重要之發展可能已迫在眉睫，雖截止目前對於談判進展情形，尙無正式公吿，吉倫則定於廿七日乘機飛京。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿六日電〕馬歇爾特使夫婦，廿五日午間應邀赴林園於蔣主席離渝赴蓉前共進午餐，廿六日晨九時半馬氏夫婦自山洞返渝，今日馬氏之接待來賓日程上未排定任何的會，馬氏夫婦可能於廿九日離渝飛京。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿六日電〕益世報今日載稱：馬歇爾特使吿民主同盟領袖稱：「如果中共能明白說明其要求，並提出政治解決方案，則東北戰事可於二十四小時停止」。此訊未能獲得馬氏總部之證實。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿六日電〕中共周恩來今夜重申前言，該黨以「無條件停戰」爲討論東北問題之代價。政府發言人吳國楨駁斥周氏之停戰方式稱：「東北無條件停戰，適將承認中共破壞一月十日之停戰命令爲合法行爲。」國共雙方意見，雖然大相逕庭，馬歇爾特使已決定在陪都至少再盤桓兩日，希望雙方妥洽解決。惟馬氏夫婦將留陪都，最短至下週一爲止。蔣主席現已赴成都作臨別前之巡行，定下週一返陪都。如照周恩來辦法解決，中共將控制東北大部份地區，長春與哈爾濱亦在其內，此點周氏亦以爲然。周氏又稱：「一俟東北戰事停止，吾人即願討論東北局勢之經濟與政治問題，非待戰事停止，吾人不欲商談東北局勢。余與馬歇爾將軍交換意見時，已以此種觀點，向馬氏解釋，余準備今日即簽訂以無條件停戰爲根據之停戰新協定。余希望一俟戰事停止即會同軍事三人小組委員或他人親赴東北調査，屆時將巡視共軍東北司令部及東北其他城市。如果政府供給輸送工具及屋宇，而談判亦恢復進行，則吾人可於下月初將辦事處遷往南京。吾人現願繼續談判政府改組等一般問題，但政府並無代表留渝與吾人會談」。整軍協定規定應由國軍五軍及共軍一軍進駐東北，報載周氏已要求修改此項協定，然周氏否認此說，僅稱：「自該協定簽訂以後，東北局勢已大爲改觀」。同時，國共雙方今日均稱，關於四平街區戰事，及哈爾濱情况，並無新消息。</p>
<h3>繆逆斌再提證件</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿六日電〕僞監察院副院長繆逆斌，對判死刑不服，申請覆判後，廿六日又提出顧祝同將軍親筆函件及中央人員金志濤，顧敦吉，鍾振才被害營救經過事實，呈由高院轉最高法院，俾為覆判時之有利證據。</p>
<h3>我精銳憲兵一營到滬　五月中開拔赴日　將擔任四國島佔領任務</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國奉令佔領日本之第一支軍懲兵獨立第三營全體官兵，業於昨日全部抵滬，集中於楊樹浦公大紗廠第一廠。本報記者昨特趨訪該營營長高瘦影氏，據吿該營在抗戰時期，奉令在印度成立，迄本年九月底適爲二週年。全體官兵的計六百餘人，均係吾國最優秀之人才編制而成，集中後再加以整訓，可望於五月中旬開拔。</p>

<h3>國軍開入四平街車站　沿鐵道迂廻前進　八面城大窪街以東無共軍</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕東北局勢在最近一二週內，將有嶄新發展，關係方面稱二華南國軍之源源北運與杜韋明之回瀋指揮，將使東北國軍之地位大爲改善，並加强其接收力量。軍息，國軍已正式開入四平街車站，惟交通界訊，由瀋北開火車仍以距四平街廿公里之雙廟子車站爲其終點，鄭副長官洞國，刻亦在該處指揮，日前瀋平盛傳國軍已抵達公主嶺附近，尙屬言之過早。就目前戰局觀之，國軍似以鐵道綫由兩旁迂迴前進，公主嶺附近爲山地，將來該處當有一番血戰。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿六日電〕據瀋陽軍息，共產軍仍在據守公主嶺，新一軍之某數部隊曾採迂迥戰術獲得若干進展，但主要戰事仍在該區之南方進行。此間國軍方面透露：北平及瀋陽與哈爾濱及齊齊哈爾間之電訊交通已全部中斷，此點亦顯示蘇軍已自該兩城撒退，而共產黨已予以佔領。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿六日電〕報載瀋陽來訊稱：國軍抄越四平街，經激戰後已抵達公主嶺東方之二石家寨（譯音）以及其他據點。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿六日電〕軍息，接防部隊於前進至四平街南方之鴨湖砲附近時，遭受共軍襲擊，經激烈戰鬥，共軍不支潰去，當俘獲共軍三十餘名，內有日籍司令風間行雄及三浦雄二名，風間行雄供稱：彼充共軍第十四旅一團機三連三班機槍班長，三浦雄供稱：彼充共軍十九旅第六十六團七連機槍班長，並云，在四平街之共軍，每師旅均雜有日籍軍人百名。</p>
<p>〔又電〕軍息：我接防國軍，於本月廿二日晨十時半進駐八面城，現八面城至大窪街以東之附近地區，已無共軍。　〔合衆社香港廿六日電〕今晨此間透露：美海軍之坦克登陸艇四艘，載中國第九十三軍之官兵四千人，昨日離九龍前往東北。美海軍先前已將新一軍及第八軍自華南運往北方，此次所運者爲三個軍，此外，尙有第五十四軍亦在美國方面負靑載運範圍之內。</p>
<h3>鈕先銘飛海瀋</h3>
<p>各地小組迭起波折</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕軍調部政府副參謀長鈕先銘，廿六日偕東北中心小組政府組長蔡宗濂飛瀋，一週可返，近來各地小組迭生波折，高密交通小組，因修路不成，政府代表欲返平，而中共代表不願，濟南小組曾往參加調處，亦無結果。徐州交通小組政府代表以隴海路東段久已修復，而不能通車，亦於今日返平請示，後日返徐。石家莊小組中共代表亦因參加該小組之中共人員在石被扣，而於廿四日突返平，政府方面對此問題解釋稱，被扣之二人，乃超出原定十二人以外之人員，且係出於誤會，究明已予釋放，惟撤返北平之中共代表何時返石，尙不悉。</p>
<h3>調處執行部　籌設整軍處</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕軍調部已籌備增設整軍處，美方人員大部已到，政府方面鄭介民亦擬方案送軍政部，由部派員來平，參加執行部工作。此次整軍將設專科，分編制，裝備，補給，訓練，每科五人，處長下設二參謀，共廿三人。中共方面尙未聞動靜，如三人小組協商順利，可望迅速成立。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕鄭介民今吿記者，江南整軍工作，可於五月中吿一段落。另悉，河北整軍亦部分開始，十一戰區所屬現駐新鄕附近之第三十軍與第四十軍，均已整編爲師，番號不變，已於四月十日編竣。</p>
<h3>蘇州縣府裁員</h3>
<p>科長棘手一致辭職</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿六日電〕吳縣政府奉令裁員，遵照省頒規定，全部人事僅爲四十七人，每月辦公經費亦經確定爲五萬元左右，各科除科長一人外，僅設科員一人，縣府全體科長，秘書以本縣爲一等縣，幅員遼闊，政務繁冗，甲於本省各縣，設遵照省令辦理，殊難週密，應付頗感棘手，爰於廿五日晚召開緊急府務會議，全體科長，秘書等一致面向逯縣長辭職，當時由逯縣長表示慰留，一面特派主任秘書陳椿於昨日晉省，向王主席及民廳長請示。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕瀋陽電話：（一）哈爾濱已完全爲共軍攻據，本日瀋陽電台未接獲哈市電台電報，董彥平領導之軍事團或已離哈，隨蘇軍撤退。（二）長春機塲美機一架，共軍進入後一度被扣，現已獲得共軍允許從事修理，一二日即可由美國武官波克駕駛回瀋。（三）潘陽南下車，可通營口，廿四日已售票。（四）長春趙市長，吉林王代主席在長被俘後，共軍對之尙客氣。</p>

<p>〔合衆社窐蒂柯廿六日電〕杜魯門總統宣稱：廿七日將在總統遊艇「威廉斯堡」號上，接見艾森豪威爾將軍，檢討渠所擬在太平洋美軍各基地上作一月視察旅行之計劃，總統並未透露會談主題，但此間之政治觀察家相信，該次會談之性質，對於太平洋上美軍各前哨地之未來防禦計劃，頗見重大。又艾氏此行，除視察太平洋美軍基地外，並將順便前往中國與日本一行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕陸軍參謀總長艾森豪威爾與海軍軍令部長尼米茲，今日向陸海軍方面隨軍牧師發表演說，艾帥稱：我人必須盡力實行漸進的縮減軍備，並應熱心祈禱國際合作努力之成功，除重振道德外，聯合國機構殆無希望，我人將有一日在原子彈爆炸下化爲灰燼，軍民兩界牧師之積極領導，今日較戰時需要允亟。我人於大變動之後，正在經歷一懷疑，惶惑，恐懼，猜疑時代，惟有藉永遠不變之眞理，爲之指導，方能安然渡過。尼米茲隨同艾帥讚揚各收師之戰時功績，謂日軍攻擊珍珠港，菲律賓及在爪哇附近作戰時，收師死傷之多，爲海軍任何部份所不及。</p>
<h3>搬運艾北工業設備事　美已接獲聨覆文　國務院宣布現正在研究中</h3>
<p>〔美新聞處華盛頓廿五日電〕國務院本日宣布：二月九日美國致蘇聯第二次牒文，請求報吿關於中國指責蘇軍曾由東北搬走一戰利品」之事，蘇方之覆文已收到，現正在國務院硏究中，蘇聨之覆文，係交莫斯土美大使館轉遞者。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電電〕據非正式可靠消息：蘇聯爲搬運中國東九省工業設備事，向美國提出之復文，美國官方認爲並不滿意。蘇聯復牒係答復三月間美國之詢問，由華盛頓一部份權威人士視之，無異拒絕美國抗議。東北問題爲亞洲和平前途所繫，美國對於蘇聯在佔領東九省期間搬走全部工業設備一事，實際上曾加以指責，緣美國於二月間致蘇聯照會中曾反對蘇聯行爲，認爲與聯合國共同處置領土與資產之原則不符，此項領土與資產應屬中國，並應由聯合各國共同決定，不能由一國擅自處置。蘇聯於三月初提出覆文，加以駁斥，謂蘇軍以東九省日本工業曾接濟日軍，視爲「戰利品」而加以搬走，並無不合。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕關於蘇聯佔有東九省日方財產事，蘇方已提出新照會，答覆美國，然美方官員感覺不滿，現擬重新研究是項問題．據外交當局意見，美國務卿貝爾納斯刻在巴黎，可能與蘇聯外長莫洛托夫非正式談論此事。此間官方人士說明美國對東九省之政策，分爲兩點：（一）設法使聯合國商妥處置日方財產之方法，（二）以中國管理東九省爲根據，奠定遠大經濟政策，以免兩國間自訂協定，不予美國以投資及經商之機會。</p>
<p>美已派鮑萊赴東北　調查蘇方搬運數量</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕關於蘇聯搬運中國東九省工業設備事，蘇聯對美國之質問，已於今日提出復文，據獲悉內容者稱：其措辭仍係重申蘇聯過去政策，即視該項工業設備爲戰利品，並主張應由中蘇共管。美國官員甚恐蘇聯對其堅持兩點，終能如願以償，若然，則美國商業及政治勢力將不能及於東北之廣大區域。杜魯門總統爲局部應付此一問題起見，已派賠償專員鮑萊赴東北，調査究有若干工業設備已被蘇方搬去美政府認爲，如欲確定日本賠償政策，調查工作，實屬必要。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕國務院宣稱：日本國內外資產，將作爲賠款，用以償付參加太平洋戰爭各國，國務院即將爲此設立聯合國賠償機關主持其事，日本工業設備作爲對各國政府之賠償，其一切移動事宜，須由該機關核准辦理，各國政府要求賠償，當以戰時損失爲根據。先是，有人要求遠東委員會美國代表麥考埃將美國提議在該委員會範圍內設立賠償機關之內容予以公布，國務卿貝爾納斯曾於二月九日向中蘇兩國提出照會聲明反對由聯合國任何一國軍獨將亞洲方面日本資產擅作最後處置，並聲明美國準備就賠償政策提出建議，供太平洋方面聯合各國考慮。並稱：美國收到日本賠償之工業設備與其他炎產將予以出售，惟非俟聯合各國贊同此項政策，美國不能採取任何行動，接收並分配日本資產，作爲賠償之一部份。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>四強外長會議的召開</h3>
<p>四强外長會議，業於二十五日召開於巴黎。此一會議之召開，原係上承「月間倫敦四强外長會議之餘緒。上次倫敦四强外長會議不歡而散，對於義，芬，匈，保，羅諸國和約各點，未能獲致協識，於是交由次官會議獲取協議起草和的。可是在過去三月間，次官會議雖辛勤努力，工作迄未進展，而原定五月一日在巴黎召開和平會議之期轉瞬將屆。美國務卿貝爾納斯因於本月四日知照英法蘇三國，對於次官會議工作之遲滯，表示遺憾，同時主張四强外長應於四月廿五日集議於巴黎，俾能決定五月一日和平會議之召開。英法首先表示贊同，蘇聯旋亦同意，四强外長會議因得於本月廿五日如期召開於巴黎。英法美蘇四强外長，今又欣然相聚一堂。此一四强外長會議之召開，旣係計議和的之草擬及和平會議之籌開，若能獲致協議，對於歐洲前途，關係自極重要。原定五月一日在巴黎召開之和平會議，是否能如期召開，就要看這次四强外長會議的成就如何。如果這次四强外長會議能够對義，芬，匈，羅，保諸國的和的獲得協議，則五月一日和平之會，當不難如期召開；問題就在能吾獲得協議。</p>
<p>四强外長會議的主要課題，爲衆所周知，便在如何覓取對義，芬，羅，匈，保諸國和約的協議。本來，對芬蘭的和的，原由英美蘇三國起草；對羅，保，匈三國和的由英，美，蘇三國起草；對義和約則由英法美蘇四國起草。可是對芬和的，到現在爲止，僅有蘇聯與芬蘭的單獨磋商，英國始終沒有參加。對匈牙利，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞各國和的，亦未成立協議，而其中最棘手的莫如對義大利和的的草訂，各方距離極遠。因爲其間距離極遠，所以這次四強外長會議對義和約能否成立協議，不無疑問。倫敦方面對此次外長會議之召開，不抱有太多的樂觀成份，即在華盛頓，見解多少亦復相同。倘此次四強外長會議對義和的不能獲致協議，則五月一日和平會議之召開，勢必延期。目前外長會議之召開不過企圖打開難關，而這樣難關的打開，也的確還困難重重。</p>
<p>對義和約之所以有重重的困難，主要還在於土地的分割。戰前的義大利「帝國」，轄領有在地中海東部的杜德客尼斯羣島，北非的利比亞，東非的索馬利蘭及埃利屈亞。現在義大利戰敗投降，這些地方應該怎樣處分？杜德喀尼斯羣島位居地中海東部，基地很有戰略上的價値，足以控制地中海東部近東一帶，蘇聯主張交由希臘保管，原欲述用希臘，企圖擴張蘇聯的聲勢於近東。此顯與英國的利益相衝突，即美國亦不願見蘇聯勢力的擴張，足以控制地中海東部。這是對義和的之所以難成協議者一。對於北非及義屬東非，蘇聯更欲取得單獨托管，若對此予以認許，則蘇聯的勢力將伸至地中海中部和印度洋，作爲大英帝國命脈的蘇　士運河將遭到嚴重的威脅，此又難爲英美所認可。這是對義和的之所以難成協議者二。</p>
<p>在對於舊義大利殖民地分割的問題以外，在義大利本國也還沒土地再分割的問題。埠姆屈里埃斯脫一帶原是情形極爲複雜的地區。第一次世界大戰前，其地屬於奧匈帝國，但這裏的居民卻有義大和人及南斯拉夫人。第一次世界大戰後，文豪鄧南遮舉義旗於阜姆，其地遂歸義大利。至於屈里埃斯脫原屬奧，有南斯拉夫人。如今南斯拉夫要求劃歸該國；而南斯拉夫在鐵托元帥的統治下，與莫斯科固極接近。南斯拉夫若得屈里埃斯脫，無異蘇聯的勢力伸展至亞德里海，與英國控制地中海的傳統政策又起了正面衝突。對義和的之所以難成協議，這也是一個大因素。此外，又有奧義邊境的鐵羅爾問題，其地原屬於奧，爲奧義人雜居之區，第一次世界大戰後割歸義大利，以迄於今。當然，在土地分割問題以外，還有對義陪償問題，各國意見亦未能一致。</p>
<p>總觀四强外長會議對和約之所以難成協議，主要還是由於「權力政治」在作崇。若干國家企圖稱霸天下，到處想擴張勢力。這種企圖當然要與原來的勢力發生衝突；因此協議就難於獲致了。依據目前這種形勢來看，無疑地，和的之所以難成協議，是蘇聯的政策與英美的政策距離過遠。英美的利益不完全相同。其所恃政策自亦不無差異，但對於上述種種，英美的態度可以說是多少相近的。中國對歐和約不參與草訂，依照戰爭不可分，和平不可分之原則，顯有未合。但對歐和的的草訂旣有我們的盟邦在主持其事，雖我們自身不直接參加，相信國際正義仍富昭申。我們願這次外長會議的成功！</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿六日電〕四强外長會議今日在盧森堡故宮舉行，蘇聯對美法兩國參與五軸心附席國締約談判之權利問題，表示讓步，故會塲空氣融洽。蘇拒絕法國加入對保，匈，芬，羅等國之締的談判，爲去冬九月間倫敦外長會議失敗之主因。美國並未與芬蘭作戰，茲亦決予美國以對芬締的談判之出席權利。但據悉：美國在事實上或不致於對芬締的時加入表決。法國可參加五軸心附庸之和的談判，但祗能在對義締結和的之一案中參與表決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎二十六日電〕四國外長會議，商討歐洲新和的，蘇聯聲明於討論巴爾幹各國和的時，准許法國參加，此舉已在會議中造成樂觀新氣氛。莫洛托夫聲明准許法國參加商討巴爾幹和的實已改變其去歲在倫敦外長會議時宜佈之決定，頗出人意料。莫氏稱：彼並不反對法方旁觀者列席討論巴爾幹各國及芬蘭之和的，而討論芬蘭和的時，美代表亦將列席，但無投票權。消息傳出，各國代表均頗樂觀，謂莫氏此舉，或可表示莫斯科對其他問題，亦將緩和態度。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯赴法出席外長會議，挑有重要提案，以望打開歐洲和的問題之僵局。其內容主張歐洲各國免除關稅，實行自由貿易，定期五年，俾加速歐洲大陸之經濟復興，惟貝爾納斯顧問對此，意見紛歧。</p>
<h3>首次會議並無結果</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿五日電〕據今夜官方消息：四强外長今晚在盧森堡古宮舉行首次會議，討論巴爾幹及德意志問題，一經接觸，即起衝突。美國務卿貝爾納斯與法外長畢杜爾提議，此次會議應將魯爾問題討論解決辦法。蘇外長莫洛托夫即表示堅決反對。七時散會，一無結果。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿六日電〕四國外長昨在此間於嚴密戒備下舉行第一次會議，歷時三小時之久。據法國外交部昨夜發表之公報稱：首次會議業已決定本屆外長會議中應行採取之程序，繼復討論本屆會議之議程。會塲所在地之盧森堡宮戒備異常嚴密，僅高級代表二三十人得以進入會塲，其餘未具特別入塲證者悉被擋駕。會議室在法國大文豪囂俄紀念堂內，各代表圍圓桌而坐，貝文。貝爾納斯·莫洛托夫·畢杜爾等四位外長所坐者爲具有扶手之靠椅，其餘隨員所坐者則爲不具扶手之靠背椅，每一外長之後，均有通譯一名，各外長在舉行首次會議之先，均已由共外次提出關於會議程序之建議，主張由每一外長輪流擔任主席，法國爲邀請國，故昨日由畢杜爾任主席。議程之第一項，即爲義大利和約之內容。一般預料，此次外長會議當賡續至十日至三星期之久，畢杜爾曾表示「若能有助於協定之成立，余不惜開會兩月以完成之。」</p>

<h3>日本組閣命令　今明日即可頒下　進步黨被擯諸門外　四黨不斷進行折衝</h3>
<p>〔本報東京特派員廿六日專電〕幣原內閣，辭職以來，今已第五日，幣原迄未將新首相推薦給日皇。今日下午四時，幣原進宮晋謁日皇，外傳已向日皇推薦新首相，但據記者從可靠方面獲悉：此種傳說不確。幣原辭職後，曾以進步黨領袖資格，與自由，社會及協同黨舉行談判，以便組織新閣，結果社會黨要求在新閣中獲得首相一席，但自由黨與進步黨並不贊同，因此談判破裂。昨夜起，因黨派之離合，形勢又吿轉變。</p>

<h3>在紐約街頭看美國復員（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特約記者　毛樹清</p>
<p>擁有七百萬人口的紐的，現在不僅是美國的都市，而且是世界性的大都市了。在紐的街頭，如果你步行在百老滙路上，或者橫穿過第四十二條街，你可以看見各種不同膚色，不同頭髮，不同眼睛的人，他們彼此一模一樣，在爲事情奔忙。艱苦的戰爭過去了，在紐的街頭，看不見半點戰爭的痕跡，通脊達旦的紅綠霓虹燈，照耀著紐的的每一條街，每一個紐的的角落。戰爭冲毀了古老的歐洲近代文明，破壞了亞洲萌芽的工業，但是，對於新大陸，比從前更堅俏，更繁華起來了。</p>
<p>紐的不僅是一個工商業生產交易的都市，而且是大量消耗的都市。有一位美國的經濟學家統計，全美國工業生產量的百分之七十五，是被婦女們消費的。在紐的，正可以充份的得到證明，不信嗎？你踏進『旁特』，「曼賽』幾家大公司，你注意樓上樓下的雇客，一大半都是美國的太太小姐們。在紐的，現在最難買到的東西，是絲襪，特別是透明經久耐用的『耐隆』貨。這並不是說美國缺乏絲襪生產，事實上，美國是當今製造絲襪生產最多的國家（其次是瑞士），就因爲美國的婦女們消耗得太厲害了，常常某一家運到一批絲襪，報上廣吿一登出，第二天，立刻就排著隊來買，不到半天，貨物完了。</p>
<p>在紐約，不僅是絲襪而已，買箭牌或者『漫海墩』牌子的西裝襯衣，都非常困難，而且每次祇限購一件。在我未到美國以前，歐洲的朋友都這麼想：『暫時將就一下吧，一到美國，什麽都任憑你有了』：然而事實都不如此。據說，紐的的人口，在逐日增多。戰爭在潮過去以後的平均購買力，高漲得驚人。一部份因戰爭停滯的工業，還不能完全恢復。因之，無形之中，生產與消費之間，常常脫節。舉個頂顯明的例子，美國有好幾家打字機公司。戰前都是在國際市塲上角逐的能手，現在他不能有足够的生產，供應美國國內市塲的需要。在紐的，如果你想買一架『雷明登』打字機，非得兩個月以前預定不可，許多人急於要用，等不得那麽久，都買了現成的瑞士貨，據說：戰後幾個月以來，瑞士貨的輕型打字機，在美國有意外的暢銷。縱然美國的海關，對歐洲來的工業品，都苛以高稅，許多人仍然願意化高價購買。同時，在另一方面，我聽見一位朋友說起，『雷明登』公司，正支出大量的款項，在委託人才設計『華文打字機』，俾將來爭取中國的廣大市塲。某一位中國的名作家，已經設計了相當完美的方案，由雷明登公司試造之中。</p>
<p>資本主義的經濟制度，是市塲第一，目前，許多美國出口商人，都知道中國市塲的重要。然而，到現階段爲止，他們還是取的觀望的態度，他們認爲中國的匯率還不够堅穩，怕在將來匯率波動中吃虧。日本的生絲，已經運到紐約二萬多包，紐的郵報上用相當引人注目的標題說：「絲襪原料無虞』。它並且還有數字估計，二萬包生絲，可以製造若干萬雙絲襪。咱們中國，不是以蠶絲著稱的國家嗎？我們不是也在注意着出口貿易嗎？</p>
<p>比絲襪，打字機更缺貨的，我以爲是紐的的房子，英國的保守黨政府，因爲沒有足够的房子，給倫敦的市民，因之，在去年大選中居然垮台。法國巴黎並沒有遭逢到戰爭的破壞，但是，找房子比登天還難。在紐約，沒有異樣。前天遇到從前東吳大學的楊永淸校長，他剛剛收到國內的來信，他說：上海南京都爲找房子發生困難。『房荒問題，現在已經成爲一個世界性的大問題。』大凡每逢經過一次戰爭，人口必定大量集中到都市，集中都市，都市的居住，就成了問題。據說，在戰前，紐的的人口雖然早就很多，但是在漫海墩市區找房子，還是容易，漫海墩上半城一帶，洗衣店玻璃窗上，常常貼有某處房屋召租的廣吿。這次我到紐約，按圖索驥的走了三天，沒看見一張廣吿。洗衣店的老顯，祗是搖頭。有好幾家大院子，在紐的時報上，登了一條極窄極窄的分類小廣吿，紐的時報半夜一點鐘出版。一點半鐘，就有人開了軍子去定租下了。二點鐘以後，一直到第二天，電話機響得不停，全部都是想租房子的。房東老太太實在不耐煩了，把聽筒拿了下來：「這才眞的煩人哪，全紐的又不是祗有我們一家房子！』房東太太皺着眉兒吿訴我這段故事。（未完）</p>

<h3>傳式雨太會說話　把罪責推得精光　昨晨公審時頗多狡辯　自稱與一般漢奸作風不同</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕歷任僞鐵道部長。僞建設部長。偽浙江省長等職之俾式雨，勝利後即爲軍事機關拘捕，經移送高檢處偵査終結，提起公訴。昨日下午二時半，由高院公開審理。因該院預發旁總券限制旁聽人數，故法庭秩序甚佳。被吿家屬戴黑眼鏡亦到庭旁聽。而傅女於其父押回監中途經身旁時，低聲呌喚「爸爸」，傳對之黯然無語。二時半過，劉毓桂庭長偕蔡晋。邱煥瀛兩推事及戴榮　檢察官。楊大器書記官升座。被吿神色黯然，精神不佳，由兩法必警攙扶押上。傳衣灰呢夾袍，足穿黑緞白底鞋，鬢髮已呈灰白，兩眼紅睡，手持在</p>
<p>獄中撰就之自白書，立於被吿　　　　劉庭長首問年歲籍　住址及職業。答稱，五十六歲，溫州人，住亞爾培路四十一號，以前服務敎育界。繼由戴檢察官陳述起訴要旨，分通謀敵國勾結日方·辦理淸鄕·擴充僞保安隊·發行公債。繳納獻機金等數點。（起訴書詳見昨報）劉庭長即問被告對此有何申雨，傳即出限鏡帶上，則　手中之白白　，稱可。</p>
<p>分數點答辯</p>
<p>（一）關於起訴書稱，以考察鐵路爲名，勾結敵方之點，被吿於廿九年十一月奉僞行政院令，率領二司書二秘書赴日考察，躭留十多天，此外並無其他作用。並未與日朝野有何來往。彼告所學爲開礦工程，事變前無所事事，戰時又在種種不得已下出任僞職。但所負皆爲消極之職務，根本未有與敵勾結企圖。（二）起訴書所載辦理淸鄉，摘充僞保安隊，繳納獻機金三點，被吿富時已任僞職，上級命令，當然不能完全不顧。當時僞軍素質不良，爲解除人民痛苦計，故加以整編，自敵人手中接管。武器旣劣人數較前更少，何來擴充之事。至改編目的，爲使不致狐假虎威，患害老百姓，且灌以愛國思想，故僞保安隊多能與游擊隊聯絡，使敵人疲於奔命。被吿時常吿誠被等，一時</p>
<p>受氣不要緊，至總反攻時，要一致爲國效命。至於辦理淸鄉，乃奉富時僞淸鄕委員會之命。該會由汪精衛任正會長，周佛海陳公傳任副會長，李士羣任秘書長。淸鄕名義亦全出日人要求。軍事由日人負責，南京政府祇負行政責任。其對象爲以新四軍作目標。被吿本不願辦理此事但有上級命令，其實淸鄕祇是騙人之語。不可能亦毫無意義。關於繳納獻機金事，係由三十二年僞府通令各省市照勃者。當時上海共繳五六千萬，浙江拖延再三，始繳四百萬僞幣，故檢察官所稱浙江繳一千四百萬，不確。（三）關於發行建設公債，係前任建設部長陳君慧任內之事。被吿出任僞建設部長之任期甚短，當時</p>
<p>値軍事緊張一切水陸交通，皆在敵人管轄之一上，故除對於丹陽縣及東太湖等地之水利工程外，別無其他工作。彼吿雖任僞職，自始至終，以愛國救民為宗言。至二十九年三月赴京出任僞較，全由梅思平及上海敵憲兵隊之催逼云。被吿至此列舉許多反證稱：赴京出任僞職，曾得軍統局毛肇之同意，且以後時常供給情報。後毛爲敵所捕，經被吿疏通保釋。毛率其子毛敬泉來京道謝後，即赴內地。後太平洋戰起，再度自港來滬，並介紹郭震任僞吳興警察局長，以作軍事聯絡員。後又介紹伍立興往寗波負聯絡之責。並策動蘇浙皖三省之僞軍，以謀反攻時作內應。後毛於該年四月二十三日在滬病歿，其子則入僞建設部，掛專員名義，今亦在軍統局內任事。此外曾先後保釋中美合作所員鄭慶肯·三靑團龔蔚珍·忠義救國軍孔慶石·陳仲等。而第四戰區湯恩伯曾派張玉麟·許復，浙江忠養救國軍阮淸源派楊崇明等與被吿聯絡；而當時兩路黨部主任委員吳培雲，曾來滬同赴南京與陳公博商量如何配合反攻之事。故被吿雖任偽職，態度一向爲國家，並不與一般漢奸作風相同，請廳上明鑒。被吿又列舉種種反對日本收軍米拆麗之事。至此戴檢察官</p>
<p>又起立補充稱，被吿又曾任僞中央政治委員會委員，物資統制委員會委員等職。被吿對此皆供認不諱。但稱，僅具虛名，大事全由汪周陳等決定。庭上又以當時僞報所載傳之談話稿等質問，被吿不曰「弄錯」即曰「無此事」。至日政府贈被吿二等勛章事，答稱，係與南京政府互相交換者。但被吿僅見報載，未曾領到。問聯絡反攻之程序怎樣？答稱，浙江有僞保安隊，江蘇有任援道，徐伯誠，蘇北有孫良誠，南京則有僞警備師。最後問及被吿之財產時，則苦笑答稱，被吿爲一敎書者，沒有什麽財產。審訊至此，吿一段落，被吿要求下次傳訊阮淸源·張玉　·毛敬泉；許復·楊崇明·何培榮·李錡·　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　訊。</p>

<h3>三方面軍法庭　受理案件　三十餘起</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第三方面軍司令部軍事法庭庭長劉世芳，昨告記者：該法庭目前受理案件約三十餘起，戰犯的八十餘人，但其中有三分之二均無人證物證，此等無法偵審之戰犯，將仍交還戰俘管理處。記者因市民向地院檢察處報吿敵人罪行者極多，深以劉氏之言爲異，特以叩問，劉氏當即答稱，此項報告之目的恐多係希　　　　　　營時大多不能確定此項戰犯　姓名，因之事實上不能認爲有力證據。劉氏目前之官階爲少將，穿草綠色軍服，然談吐幽默，不脫學者木色，曾吿其友人云：「平常人家總是叫我劉博士，劉敎授，那一天和幾位外國友人吃飯，他們口口聲聲叫「。將軍」，我竟不知道他們在招呼誰，後來看他們對我瞧，我才知道原來說的是我！」其風趣可見一斑。</p>

<h3>藝軒中一席話　梅劇團　此番上演　具三難　終於一一順利解決　—惜餘—</h3>
<p>從今天起，梅劇團正式在南京大戲院上演了，演期預定十二天。如果可能的時候，也許在十二天期滿之後還可以延長幾天。上海人士和梅博士闊別已久，上次雖然也演過幾大崑曲，可是崑曲畢竟曲高和寡，喜歡聽京戲的人士終不免略感失望，這次公演，周郞們可以痛痛快快的過戲　了。</p>
<p>記者昨天特地和本市名琴票倪秋萍君一同到藍田路去拜訪梅先生，平時梅先生在寓吊嗓，就是倪君操琴的。不巧得很，梅先生和王琴生先生出門拜客去了，却看見了闊別十載的徐蘭沅先生，就在幽靜的斅藝軒裏暢談起來，原來這次上演眞也可以說是困難極了。第一，梅劇團的塲面是有名的，每逢一個新腔，總是風靡全國。可是徐蘭沅在北平事務極忙，他在族德樓有股子，竹闌軒（北平著名的竹器店）又得要他主持，戰爭八年，從未操絃，這回是梅博士的交情，才飛到上海來。王少卿以前為李世芳操琴也是拉胡琴不拉二胡，這回也是八年來第一次舊調重彈。外加王琴生的胡琴是楊實忠，所以這次演出，倒是集京胡二胡三聖手於一堂，托腔不必說，就是聽聽過門也够味的了。</p>
<p>第二，配角也難找。王琴生的名字雖然在上海似乎還生疏，但他實在是一位前途無限的後起之秀，他是譚小培的高足，早就紅遍舊都　部了。凈角仍是去美時的老搭擋連榮，小生是姜香妙。兪振飛，看上去販馬記還是有上演可能的。</p>
<p>第三，最難的是塲子——想不到「梅大王」上台都費盡了力氣代找到了南京大戲院這個塲子！如果不是多方面的帮忙，簡直就是英雄無用武之「地」。南京大戲院從來沒有演過京戲，租費也相當可觀，據他們估訂，這次演出在營業上竟是很少賺錢的把握。梅畹華一生仗義疎財，這次演出的主要目的實在還是爲了報答千千萬萬的梅迷罷了。</p>
<p>爲了調劑擁擠起見，第一個！目「宇宙鋒」要連演三天，第二個劇目是「寳蓮燈」，大槪也要連演兩天。</p>
<p>梅大王的大公子葆琛也從重慶回來了，這幾天就在忙着械點戲票，看上去連來十二個滿堂是穩的了。</p>
<h3>東京聨合國軍事法庭　十日內可開審　向拆濬檢察官來滬公幹</h3>

<p>〔聯合社東京廿五日電〕據遠東國際法庭檢察處稱：東條英機等日本主要戰犯，起訴書已印就裝釘，至遲在下星期二即可向國際法庭提出。</p>

<h3>會見馬占山將軍　願以松花江水為墨瀋，以黑龍江畔　蓊鬰森林為筆花，替馬將軍作畫像</h3>
<p>— 本報廿日重慶航訊　特約記者趙浩生</p>
<p>馬占山將軍的威名，和功勳，像長白山頭長年不化的積雪一樣的光耀。「馬占山」，是與「柬北」永遠聯繫着的一個光榮的名子！當爲東北問題而起的世界性的戰爭已經勝利結束，而今天，東北問題又成爲舉世矚目的問題，關心東北問題的人，都在注視着馬占山將軍的動態。</p>
<p>馬占山將軍在一個月前，由大同經北平到重慶來了，記者看到馬將軍，像看到了在記憶中自小學時候就開始了的抗日歷史。這位六十二歲的老將軍，依然是英武豪邁，和他在十餘年間，所寫就的雄武歷史一樣的光輝活躍。</p>
<p>爲本報所作之簽名式　長途飛行　病後略現憔以</p>
<p>他穿着一身草綠色土呢料子的新式陸軍軍裝，那淸瘦並不高大的身材，看上去確實已微現龍鍾了，然而，他的精神，他的豪氣，不減當年，他修着短短的平頭，銀白的髮根，閃閃發亮，面孔是表現在那生命力跳躍的面孔上，雖然淸瘦，但絕沒有一般老年人的鬆懈。這次從北平來，長途飛行勞頓，下飛機後，就在臥病，記者見到馬將軍的那天，他的面色，依然現着病後的憔悻。</p>
<p>見過馬將軍的人，都會很記得他那充滿感人力量的眼睛，那一雙並不很大的睛眼，却有着炯炯照人的光彩，嵌在那瘦削的面孔上，顯得深邃威嚴，從那一雙眼睛裏，你可以知道馬將軍十餘年英勇戰鬥的歷史是怎樣寫成，你更可以確信這位六十二歲的將軍，並未衰老。</p>
<p>純粹口音　充滿親切韻味</p>
<p>馬將軍操着一口純粹的東北口音，那口昔是低沉的，厚重的，完滿樸實親切的情調和動人感情的，馬將軍有一個常用的口語，就是—「我腦子裏總這麽想」。「這麽」兩字的發音，尤其是充分表現着東北話的特殊韻味。</p>
<p>馬將軍談到他十餘年的抗日戰爭，他的解釋很簡單：「九一八」以後，是爲了擾亂敵人不能安穩的佔領東北。馬將軍所率領的義勇軍，成了東北不會淪亡的象徵。馬將軍的威名，是使敵人永遠感到不安的根源，當時日本軍民，沒有一個不知道馬占山將軍的，沒有不敬畏馬占山將軍的，他們曾各處畫像縣賞捉拿馬將軍，最後，更自己欺騙自己，在日木陳列館裏，陳列起馬將軍的衣帽皮靴等，宣傳着馬將軍已經被打死。由此可見馬將軍給予敵人的威脅之大！</p>
<p>年事高邁　退休尚非其時</p>
<p>東北的抗日戰爭吿一段落後，馬將軍本來已經打算休息了，但接着是「七七」事變，全面的抗日戰爭發動，馬將軍義不容辭的接受了最高領袖的命令，祖任東北挺進軍總司令，東北招撫俠，及黑龍江省主席。八年來，馬將軍在緩西各地與敵人相持，直到抗戰勝利。　勝利後，馬將軍認爲任務已了，自己年事已高，應該休息了，曾向蔣主席懇請辭職。這次奉召來渝，又曾當面請辭。然而，正如在某次歡迎會上，有一位老年人的講演中所說：「不但蔣主席不允許馬將軍辭職，全國人民都不允許馬將軍辭職的。」</p>
<p>東北同胞　愛國家愛領袖</p>
<p>對於東北目前的情形，馬將軍有着斬釘截鐵的論斷，就是「絕不允許非法勢力的存在。』這位六十二歲的老人，他有着最熾烈的對國家和鄕土的熱愛，因此他切齒的痛恨那些破壞和平統一的。他更確鑿的說：『東北人民，愛國家，愛領袖，這種熱情，是任何力量所不可侮的。」同時，他以更大的熱情，渴望着東北的和平建設。在一次旅渝華僑的歡迎會上，他說他願作介紹人。請國外華僑踴躍到東北去投資開發，他現在被聘爲中國生產促進會。東北九省輔導委員會委員長。他希望着對故鄕建設事業上有所貢獻。</p>
<p>歷史保證　寫下更大功蹟</p>
<p>在重慶逗留的二十九天中，他曾被　蔣主席數次召見，於十日前飛返北平，這位十數年來與東北密切相連的老將軍，在東北是具有着極隆重的號召力量。當今天東北在極度混亂的情况中，馬將軍的動態，確實是爲全國人所最重視的。歷史將會保證馬將軍一定要用他發光的大筆，再爲國家和故鄕寫下更光榮的功蹟！</p>
<p>記者在這樣的心願之中，蘸着松花江水，一探淸澈的墨瀋，用明麗如黑能江畔蓊鬱森林的色彩，爲過去，現在和未來的馬將軍作了如上的一幅畫像。</p>
<p>將軍心事　追懷十年戰史</p>
<p>在前段文字裏，我已將離開重慶以前看到的馬占山將軍，作一個槪括的畫像，這位年老的將軍，人們從他的眉宇之間，和那被戰爭和歲月刻劃的皺紋中，可以看到埋藏在他心底的許多嚴肅沉重的感情。</p>
<p>在重慶我曾融到一位在東北義勇軍時期追隨馬占山將軍抗戰的帥長，談起這位老將軍一件最沉重的心事。這是一段十餘年前的往事，這是一段在十餘年筆才得證實的花樣，這是一個異黨遷遠的懷念。</p>
<p>「九一八」以後，馬占山將軍率領着他的部屬，租許多東北靑年，展開了對統治者的戰爭。他們在極其艱苦的條件下作戰，第一憫時期，是利用敵人的武器作大規模戰爭，第二個時期，是作游擊戰，敵人繪圖懸賞捉拿馬將軍就是這一個時期，敵人在陳列館中，陳列起馬將軍的衣帽，宣傳着馬將軍已經被擊斃，也是這一個時期。</p>
<p>馬將軍所率領的軍隊，與敵人不斷週旋，最後終由於敵人的壓力越來越大，他們的物資彈藥缺乏，關內雖然曾經發動大規模的募捐後援運動，但因路遠迢迢，無法到達戰士們的手裏，在這逼不得已的情形中，馬將軍率領着他的基本部隊二萬人退至蘇聯境內。當時蘇聯政府，曾他們以很好的招待，這是他們非常感激的事。不久，他們又從蘇聯境內移往新疆，但到達新疆以後，原來的二萬人，僅剩下一萬四千人，除了沿途疾病死亡和逃亡的有一千人外，尙有五千人，被留在蘇聯境內。這五于人，全是當時因激於愛國熱情而參加義勇軍的靑年學生。</p>
<p>現階段中　一個重要的結</p>
<p>這些被留在異國的戰士們，據說在這十餘年中，蘇聯曾加以嚴格訓練，但因爲與國內的音訊斷絕，馬將軍對他們的生活，異常懷念。</p>
<p>流轉到新疆的一萬四千人，在這十餘年中，有不少被盛世才所殺，這萬餘人的流亡生活，也常在馬將軍的親切繫念中。</p>
<p>而今抗戰勝利了，十餘年苦難的日子，應該從此結束，馬將軍最近不斷接到在新疆的舊部給他的信，請求馬將軍設法馬上送他們回家。馬將軍曾將此事面陳　蔣主席，正計劃把他們妥爲安置，使他們各得其所，與全國各抗戰部隊一起復員，被留在蘇聨的五千人，據雨現在已經都在東北出現了。</p>
<p>東北在混亂中，這五千人混亂中的動能，成了關心東北問題所重視的事情，成了錯綜複雜的東北問題中，一個重要的「結」。</p>
<h3>蘇北「解放區」實錄　關於懲「奸」及施政眞面目</h3>
<p>— 鍾明</p>
<p>記者是蘇北的窮敎員，最近，在我們蘇北「解放區」的「民主政府」展開了懲「奸」運動，記者雖然不曾參加僞組織，因爲曾受了相當的敎育，指導員和保長先生們就常到我的居處來「請安」。常來「請安」，我怎能當得起呢？因此，就只好於半月前跑到上海來了，現在把記者在蘇北親眼見到的所謂「解放區」的種種，寫出來投稿，供讀者硏討。</p>
<p>「自新」登記</p>
<p>共軍「解放」了每個城市後，下令將一班僞化人員，實行「自新」登記，並舉辦「時事研究會」將僞化人員分批調往受訓，在會上提出三項「保證」，四項「要求」。所謂三項「保證」是受訓後（一）身份保證，（有公民權），（二）財產保證，（貪汚之財產亦不論），（三）職業保證。所謂四項「要求」：是一要絕對信仰「民主政府』，二要澈底坦白，（過去政治路錢經歷都要坦白），三要控訴（曾在中央機構下工作者對過去的首長要加以控訴），四要檢舉，（漢奸未自首者或坦白不够者，均要加以檢舉。）畢業時，選了一部份參加「民主政府」工作：其餘解散回家。僞化人員當時咸感戴「民主政府」之大德。</p>
<p>「公判」工作</p>
<p>可是近來「民主政府」露出眞面目了。他不僅嚴厲地展開懲「奸」運動，並且還剷除「三資」（資識份于，資產階級，資望人士。）其辦法每鎭辦有民衆學校和伸寃委員會，强迫無產階級者每家去一人參加，民衆學校不是敎的識字踝，而是做的檢舉和審判工作。校中設有校委，（每保一人，）負調査責任，將一班僞化人員，「三資」份子等調查淸楚，報告指導員，或由學員檢舉，然後抓到公安局，敎他到民校去向民衆表白，表白後由人民「公判」，眞是人民的意思公判嗎？那只有天曉得！</p>
<p>關於「公判」，又有下面幾種：（一）有財產者罰米，（絕不罰錢）（二）有智識者，有資望者或所謂「國特」判徒刑，釘鐐受禁。情節重大者，開民衆大會，槍決。（三）對於小漢奸，即智識水準不够又無鈔票者，則拘入「人民監獄」，（在一定期限內不准離開住所。）（四）對於特種情節者刺面，游街示衆。（五）對於罰米不能如期交到或彼等認爲必要者，則加以封產（將室內什物雜件一齊搬走，）處分。</p>
<p>自從展開所謂「懲奸運動」和「剷除三資」以來，人心惶惶，大家都恐坐牢罰米，有錢者早避居通。揚。滬。等地，而無錢之智識資望份子，亦只得不顧一切，出奔異鄉，大家都抱定「寗可餓死外面，決不任人宰割。」如果政府現在把蘇北流亡的人加以統計，數目一定可觀，其中甚多有志之士，現均躑躅街頭，尙望政府注意，並設法予以救濟。</p>
<p>查滅運動</p>
<p>「澈底减租减息」，「保證交租交息」，爲共黨標榜之政策，但區鄕政委和農抗會委員之作風，却又令人莫名其妙。最近認爲過去査减不澈底，又復重行實行，其辦法根據地主田畝數减租，結算起來，如賢方仍有可得，則算倒租，即减租追及旣往，須從新四軍到蘇北之廿九年起减租計算。這樣一來，地主不但受不到利益，並且還要向佃方打借租條，另外又要繳公糧，完錢糧，結果只有把田交給佃戶了事。</p>
<p>自衛運動</p>
<p>共軍近在蘇北，又復擴大民兵組織，美其名曰「自衛運動」。實施情形，以分區爲單位，將鄕幹人員集中受訓，現已卒業，仍赴各鄕工作，將原充民兵之壯丁，編爲區游擊速，原區游擊連編爲縣警衛團，原縣警衛團現已編爲新四軍某某縱隊番號，調往魯南，轉赴東北。至現在之民兵組織，則爲年在十八歲以上四十歲以下之壯丁，不分獨子與否和財產多寡，均須加入，所以，就現狀看來，鄕村之適齡壯丁，均爲民兵了。</p>
<p>濟荒運動</p>
<p>蘇北爲唯一大量產米區，近因共軍將米糧由海北運，形成空前奇荒。現「民主政府」規定人民日食兩餐，並不准吃食魚肉，組成下列三隊，分別活動。</p>
<p>A.「吃光隊」：有日食三餐者，或家有餘糧者，由鄕委領導，聚而坐食，如過云之麻雀會，吃光爲止。</p>
<p>B.「聞香隊」：聞有魚肉香味，羣至其家共食，彼等組有「聞香隊」專司其事。</p>
<p>C.「拆卸隊」：共軍近在各據點構築碉堡，組織拆卸隊，專門拆卸逆產，（僞員與「三資」，）房屋，並拆卸一部份至所謂根據地，供「人民」共住。</p>
<p>特工組織</p>
<p>共軍之情報牒報工作，異常周密，筆者無法知其底蘊，茲將近來對民間半公開之特工組織略記如次</p>
<p>A.「偵察隊」：共軍所行種種，人民恨之切骨，「民主政府」當局爲偵察人民「反動」，組織偵察隊專司偵察，路有二人同行，偵察隊即尾隨其後，探其所譚何事，菜館酒肆，亦經常有其人員專司情報工作。</p>
<p>B.「聽壁隊」：「聽壁隊」的工作，是專門探聽人在家里的言動，彼等認有嫌疑時，就捉將官里去。</p>
<p>經濟活動</p>
<p>蘇北現在唯一貨幣是抗幣，抗幣的種類很多，有「流通券」。「抗條」「老抗」。「新抗」。「江淮」票。「華中」票等，各式各項，有數十種之多。老抗和新抗的價値不同，弄得個個民衆頭痛。在過去有「。僞幣」時期，凡帶有僞票者沒收，其實他們自己仍然向民衆使用。如臯數月前有某稅所人員使用僞幣，爲民衆査出，閙到縣府，縣長顧維漢仍然庇護，激成全城罷市。現在法幣在蘇北亦不准流通市面，私用者沒收，但可到華中銀行去以四十比一之比率掉換「抗幣」。每日華中銀行收進之法幣，爲數甚巨，人民僉以法幣旣不准流通市面，而「華中」收去，又作何用？</p>
<p>蘇北人民負担在鄕村為完「錢糧」，繳「公糧」，（現預徵下半年，）在城鎭商民爲繳「營業稅」，「貨物過境稅」，另外共同負担的，則有「服裝捐」，「慰勞捐，「鞋子捐」，「棉被捐」，區待「抗屬捐」，「烈屬捐」，「榮譽軍人捐」等數十種。</p>
<p>『民主政府」在經濟政策方面，如妝復區之貨價提高，則提高「抗幣」價値，形成「解放區」之貨物，以抗幣計算，始終不變，如收復區之貨價低，形成物資內流時，則加重徵收進口稅，使商人毫無利益可圖，如蘇北過去產米過剩，多運江南，近因共軍收買共運，米價提高，達「抗幣」每石乙千乙百元，合法幣四萬元，而江南常熱。江陰之米，則每石僅蘇北銷售者，則加進口向江南運到蘇北銷售者，則加進口稅，每石二百元「抗幣」，變成毫無利益可圖，商人從此裹足，老百姓生活更苦。</p>
<p>商人除不用店友自營或小本販賣以維持生活外，凡屬大商店，如果再延三月，不但全部貨物吃光不够，店主還要破產淸償，因爲「民主政府」設有江海公司和裕民公司，旣以無基金之「抗幣」，套進大量法幣，向外埠購入大宗物資，自操勝算，反之，商人旣需血本，又有重重「抗稅」，成本旣大，人民處於水深火熱之中，購買力薄弱，生意淸淡，加之，店負加薪，四面楚歌，那有不倒閉之理？</p>
<p>敎育內幕</p>
<p>「解放區」的中小學敎育，注重開會式，提倡「民主」，唱歌多於敎課。中學生即可選課，不高興的課可以不聽。如果敎師干涉，即不「民主」。唯一專修科，是新民主主義，馬列主義，新的人生觀等。在東台大中集，辦有蘇中公學，並在沙溝丁所，設有分校，不論什麼程度，都可去上學，三個月畢業，分發到各基幹去工作。這個學校里除供膳宿外，連另用都發給，所以被吸收去的靑年很多。經常的校里有二十幾個隊，每隊一連，的百餘人。另外，並派優秀基幹到收復區各大中學求學，並獎勵人民子弟出外求學，給予津貼，至其目的，殊堪玩味。</p>
<p>「解放區」的交通是間斷的，沿根據地築有公路，可通汽車。靠收復區，則將公路破壞，在近接界處，設有盤査哨，遇有可疑，立加扣留，在四鄕又佈滿民兵，隨時隨地檢查行人，查到法幣，是意外財，高興時還可賞你一頓生活。</p>
<p>在民主政府之下，除看到華中版的「新華日報」和「江海導報」外，根本就沒有看過勝利後的上海報是什麽樣子。來往書信，在「解放區」也是要檢查的。郵政局的人員現在已經更換，歸「邊區政府」管轄了。（廿三日）</p>
<p>糧荒在日本</p>
<p>最近「紐的時報」上說過：從去年聖誕節以來，日方官員已採取兩種和糧荒搏鬥的步驟，東京警察取締非法糧食買賣，因而被捕的人達四百二十三名。</p>
<p>最近盟軍總部拒絕除去糧食配給單中的某些項目，意在繼續管制這些糧食，然而他又明白表示，這並不是說目前的物價應該維持原有水準。這間接地說明了政府正擬提高物價，政府或許將運用補助方法，以防止消費者的不安。</p>
<p>同時，盟軍總部國家資源組農林課課長里昂亞德少校亦宣佈：去年朝鮮美軍佔領區（產米量佔全部朝鮮百分之七一）的產米量，爲八千一百八十萬美斗，據估計：該年度朝鮮的需求，的爲七千〇二十萬美斗。這並不包括北部朝鮮的可能需求。蘇軍方面不准北部產米數字透露。</p>
<p>爲了蘇方對南北兩區貿易，迄今仍無表示，和美方採取管制日本國外貿易政策。南部朝鮮農民們對未來都抱着游移不定的心情。是以一千萬美斗食米流入輸出市塲的可能性就極少。</p>
<p>奇怪地，日本警察並不禁止黑市糧食買賣，却杜絕非配給糧食的買賣，例如蔬菜及魚類等。二百五十個蔬菜小販，和一百七十三個魚販，已因超出批發價格二倍以上的價格出售其生產品而被捕。日政府規定零售的價格，不應超出批發價格百分之二十。　金明譯</p>

<h3>敎育部開會修訂　中學課程標準　減輕中學生身心負擔　確認初中目標一元化　調整敎學圖目及時數</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶專訊〕敎部爲修訂中學課程標準，頃在渝開中學課程討州論會，討論意見之集中，歸納有若干要點，雖尙待再加審議，爲最後之決定，然大體可得而聞者，特擦　其岸略，爲關心中，敎育者預供參考：</p>
<p>旨趣</p>
<p>修訂中學課程之動機與旨趣：在減輕中學生身心負担，增加其學習效率。</p>
<p>廢止</p>
<p>廢止分組制度：中學課程，注重統。初中本學期已將英語改爲必修，已打破從前初中分甲乙組，一則準備就學，一則準備升學之規定。爲確認初中目標一元化，應明令廢止分組制度。高中不予分組，惟自第二學年起，各生就其志趣，分別選習數學，（解析幾何），英文，國語等三科，爲加修科目。</p>
<p>調整</p>
<p>高初中數學科目及時數均分別予以調整，「初中方面」，童軍課內時閒減少，課外時間時加多。博物課程標準中之地質礦物，改併於自然地理內敎學。勞作，注重實用技藝。史地，以分別集中排列敎學爲原則。「高中方面」，女生之家事看護，代替女生之勞作科目。礦物課程，爲培養地質礦物人才之準備。音樂，自二年級列爲碟外活動。史地，分別集中排列。英語一律爲必修科，高中應特重閱讀訓練，初中應從說聽兩項訓練入手，漸次進入續寫訓練。高初中每週敎學總時數，汰去或減少重複之程課鐘點，因此比戰前時數較少云。（安）</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>當局嚴密監視之下　米價直綫上升　麵粉雜糧無一不漲　市塲情形頗為混亂</h3>
<p>昨日米市以產區報價，步少上砌，人心甚堅，店銷轉暢，雖云當局嚴密監視，粳秈米及元米仍一致上漲二三千元，麵粉潮州帮仍在塲外納取，價格續漲二千元左右，黃豆亦然，再加千餘元，豆餅消路亦然，接連猛漲千元，麩皮另化頗殷，亦狂漲千元，生仁跟漲一二千元，油價店消蟬聯，暴漲三四千至四五千元不一，市面已呈混亂之狀，一致青雲直上，後情實難預料，據米市塲息，昨日本市計到白粳等六種，共五千餘石，其種類及石數如下，白粳一七九一石，杜秈六二七石，羊秋四三七石，早稻一一八〇石，薄稻一〇七九石，白元一四六石。</p>
<h3>金價續挫</h3>
<p>烚赤昨晨開平平，開後仍難支持，降至一五六萬以下，美鈔平後復俏，金市被激帶好，中途曾回升少許，迨升至一五八萬五後，買方仍格於中行管制價，不久買氣復平，午刻在一五七萬元光景盤旋，午後仍形平穩，結果較前收微挫一萬，銀樓飾金十六萬八，紋銀未更，銀元亦然，暗拆自一角二分至一角六分不等。</p>
<h3>結款絡繹不斷　美鈔形勢堅俏</h3>
<p>昨日美鈔求供稍形恍惚，實貨雖有出龍，但實銷迄未終止，有等洋行鑒於下月份物資進口更湧，逢低梢有未雨綢繆者，中途由疲轉俏，晨開二三一〇元，不久回落至二二七〇元以內，結款陸續不斷，存底又現涸竭，中途曾又升至二三三〇元以上，午刻在二三一〇元左右徘徊，後市不脫盤旋，結果較前收略微挫，港票隨羅比上落，盤旋之餘，老貨回升五元，新貨好八元，羅比五二〇允，港電四二〇元，均稍向榮，美匯掛牌未更。</p>
<h3>同行逢高吐售　紗市漲風稍定</h3>
<p>昨日紗市漲風已戢，緣連日中小型紗所漲已巨，引起同行吐售，加以雙馬欲漲無力，是以廿支各牌回降一二萬之譜，人心尙定，聞下午塲外交易復高，又午時紡建公司照例掛牌，十支至四十二支約較上期標高二萬至五萬，餘價相仿，另有十種紗綫，每種自二件至五十一件不等，仍川招標方式出售，聞內有七穏由駿成鴻大昌同泰昌等紗號標得，其價與市塲上做價不相上下</p>
<h3>現棉交易進展</h3>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊，市况近堅遠疲，計近期美金二七·八五，遠期二八·〇〇，米特林現貨未開出，本埠現棉交易進展，以民營如申新一六等廠採辦爲股，同業互做亦不惡，米特林送廠價已高至八萬八千元，數日來已漲起七八干之　，紡建公司未聞採辦</p>
<h3>茶市愈趨愈下</h3>
<p>春末夏初，正各通新業相　市之際，銷路本當旺盛，不料邇來交易竟呈江河日下之局面，價格一路挫跌，未見回頭，至其原因本街店莊胃納不佳，同時客帮等地又不暢辦，洋行方面亦沉靜如故，是以一部份貨主漸感頭寸週轉不靈，乃一致羣起傾塞，市面賣多於買，人心欲振不易，前途恐有續趨悲境之勢。</p>
<h3>焦炭到貨湧旺　白煤直綫下瀉</h3>
<p>焦炭原爲煉鋼鐵要品，亦可爲民生炊事用燃料，當前月正値滬地燃料恐慌時期，國內產無烟煤各　尙未恢復生產，滬地各殷實商行即計劃搜　天津蚌埠徐州等地所存大量焦炭，運滬備用，善價待沽，然其時各地因交通阻梗，均未能如期運裝來滬，俟至最近，始絡續裝運來滬，然最近滬地煤斤各路到貨均豐，故該貨銷路即大受影響，綜計積存滬地堆棧者當在萬噸以上，其中以井陘焦最多，開平焦次之，最少中興焦，故最近白煤市價直綫下瀉，焦炭到貨充斥亦一主因也。</p>
<p>經濟部燃料委員會，連日由秦皇島運滬開灤煤，的有數千噸之鉅，茲有自由輪「海加」號截煤六千噸，亦已抵埠，又「披弗」號，由台灣載運基隆煤，一萬噸，停泊黃浦碼頭三三——三四號浮筒，正在卸運中，越南方而不日亦有大量煤斤運滬，故本市煤斤需用無虞匱乏云。</p>

<p>出版界</p>
<h3>莎士比亞全集的出版計劃</h3>
<p>— 曹未風</p>
<p>曹未風先生的莎士比亞全集的出版計劃，可說是勝利後我國出版界的一個大胆的嘗試。看到今日出版界的畸形與不景氣，我們很願意看見這個有意議的工作的成功。——編者</p>
<p>經過了許久的考慮，我終於決定了使莎士比亞全集裏的十本，先與上海的讀者見面。</p>
<p>我所以這樣決定，是有幾個理由的：</p>
<p>（一）是我從這工作已十五年之久，開始在九一八那年的春天，在這漫長而多難的—眞是多麽的多難啊—時間裏，我始終是一個人悶着聲在幹着這件工作的，同情雖然有，鼓勵却不多，而嘲笑與冷淡却是受够了的。依我自己的意思，我是要弄得十全十美才肯印出來，可是這件事却做不到；因爲生活難得安定，參攷書—做這件事，學文學的都知道，沒有參攷書是不行的—已有的都已經丟掉了，沒有的却沒有法子買得來。似使能在見得到的未來就能够把生活改善了，專心於這件工作，那麼我也就不急於先出版這一部份，但是這個却無望。於是，我本來希望每本寫一篇較詳盡的序，多加些註解，多加幾張插圖，同改善與改正一些我自知有問題的地方，而這些都做不到。我便祗能這樣令它們赤裸裸的去同讀者見面了。因爲這時倘若不出版，也許竟再要等個十年八年，而情形還是不能改善的。</p>
<p>（二）是我在內地時由貴陽的文通書局出版過十本，這是一家好書局，主人的用意是極好的，我對它也特別有懷念的理由—我住在貴陽城外華家山上時，那年許的時光，特別値得記憶—但是限於工人及校對員的能力，那十本都錯落得不成樣子。我對於自己的稿子肯改上五遍十遍—漢姆萊特這一本就改過五次以上—而對於印出來的却一眼也不敢看。最近爲了要在上海付印，我才拿出來看，有些地方眞錯得令我面紅耳赤。這樣我就更決定趕快排印了，而且還決定自己做最後一校的校對員。</p>
<p>（三）是好像我們國內已經好久沒有這一類的出版物了。從前所謂海派的作風，現在是更「海」了；從前所謂京派的，現在沒有一位出版家敢於嘗試。大半的出版書籍，都是薄薄的一本，間或有本好書，也不容易銷到三千五千；出版社的壽命有時比銷行的壽命還要短。於是每出版一本新書，大半都是抱着蝕本決心的，雖然因爲興趣問題，有許多人是寗願蝕本也不顧的—這種人最値得我們敬佩的。中國的文化界與出版界總不該永遠如此微弱纖細，鬼魅橫行的。</p>
<p>莎士比亞的全集共當有四十本，現在先印十本；第二個十本當不久可出，至於第三個第四個十本，則恐怕尙需稍待。</p>
<p>這一個嘗試大概是勝利以後，中國出版界的第一個這類的嘗試。這件事在商業上是要失敗的，不過倘有廣大的同情能予以協助，它也可能成功。那樣，我們的出版界也許會走上一條新的途徑。</p>
<h3>介紹憲政業書</h3>
<p>— 林谷</p>
<p>潘公展主編　正中書局出版</p>
<p>三民主報與五權憲法的基本精神，不在因襲代議政治的遺規舊制，而尤在對於代議政治遺規舊制的改造與革新。中國國民黨五十年來努力的最後目的，就在建立國父理想的民主憲政而還政權於國民。至其實施的步驟和綱領，則具見於國父手訂的建國大綱，建國大綱以掃除障礙爲開始，以究成建設爲依歸，所謂軍政。訓政。憲政三時期，這是中國實行民主政制的程序。誠以積數千年來帝制的餘毒，大多數人民對於政治意識與經騐，兩皆缺乏，驟欲畀之以政權，其勢必復爲强暴所刦取。國父在日，追懷往昔，每以軍閥刦持的肆惡流毒，實皆民國初年黨員不遵訓政程序之過，所以生平對於他所定的革命方略，持之最堅。國民黨的歷史使命，雖在於建立民國，而其中心任務實在負責訓政以訓練人民有切實應用普通行政民權的充分能力和實際經騐，以免再蹈以往憲政失敗的覆轍。</p>
<p>中國國民黨在完成軍政時期確立訓政體制以後，即一面作實施憲政的準備。所謂五五憲草，歷時三年，七易其稿，方始完成。五五憲草，是一個非正式的確定草案，要使其眞正眞爲憲法，必經由國民大會來討論決定。國民大會，在戰前及抗戰時期中，曾一再擬議召集，但事實上召開大會的困難，非願望所可克服。最近原定於五月五日召開，但因事　上的困難，政府又　　暫行延期舉行了。</p>
<p>國民大會爲結束訓政開始憲政的樞紐，國民黨依國民會議所制定的訓政時期的法而行使的政權，必依國民大會所制頒的憲法而遞嬗於國民大會，政府有召開國民大會還政於民的最大誠意，人民有召開國民大會實施憲政的熱切期望。所謂還政於民，必須經過國民大會流個機構，始可有所付託。</p>
<p>現在，國民大會即將召開，其任務即為制定憲政時期的根本大法。近幾年來討論此問題的書籍已經很多，但眞能闡揚三民主義的民主政治之原理和制度的，當推潘公展民主編的正中書局出版之憲政叢書了。憲政叢書，全套十二冊，執筆者或為曾經從事五五憲草的起草者，工為對於憲法學有專門硏究者，每册均經潘氏親自校閱。這十二册書，對於憲政問題的各方面都已論列到，書名如下：陳長蘅：五權憲法草案精義，胡經明：五權憲法與各國憲法，章淵若：人民之權利義務，崔書琴：全民政治與議會政治，楊幼烱：權能劃分及均權政制，李宗黃：憲政與地方自治，楊動文：憲政與國防，伍啓元：憲政與經濟，程天放：憲法與敎育，陳念中：縣各級民意機關，王冠靑：中國憲政運動史略，潘公展：憲政庸言。前十册業已在重慶出版，止有一部分已在上海印行。</p>
<p>此外，關於憲政方面的書籍，該局尙有立法院編的中華民國憲法草案說明書，劉靜文的中國憲政原理等書，內容亦均極有價値。</p>
<h3>偏廢的書荒</h3>
<p>— 厲生</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，上海的出版界雖然已覺有了生氣，但是還未曾恢復到讀者的需要程度。忠實的讀者，仍覺苦悶！</p>
<p>譬如關於人類生命的醫學類書籍和雜誌，實在少得可憐。在每一個報擬土很難發現出一二本，即使從前出版過一二期的，也多虎顯蛇尾地闐然無聲了。還有像綜合性有意義的月刋，也已經一天少似一天了！</p>
<p>但是另一方面所謂「小型週報』，却名目繁多，日盛一日，窺其內容多半無價値可言，而敗壞風化，其害較之小學生所看的連環圖書，有過之而無不及！徒以適合一般知識幼稚者而已。</p>
<p>關於學術界的醫藥醫籍雜誌，旣日彩减少，並且學校　的學生，沒有敎科書上課的很多，這由整個的出版界，社會，國家方面來說，總不是光榮的事。</p>
<p>考其癥結的所在，不外紙張貴，和工料貴。學術方面的書籍雜誌不易賺錢，而小型週刋容易應付，不致於勝本。但是這是近視眼的看法！有意義的書報，雜誌，雖一時不能風行，人手一編，但它却如根深的大樹，不致猝倒。只要好好的栽培，何愁讀者不一天一天的增多？而小型週報　投機刋物，即使　局不取締。而其中千篇一律的無非「色悄』，讀者也會厭棄的。</p>
<p>我希望出版界自動糾正道偏廢的書荒，以謀己謀人的幸福，不要和國策背道而馳。因爲出版事業和別種商業有不同的，它是先知先覺和後知後覺的媒介者。</p>
<h3>作家的話</h3>
<p>— 良弓</p>
<p>偉大的作家，是要寫出時伏的苦悶。和創造出時代的光明。—魯迅</p>
<p>一個作家與詩人落後的原因，就是在於他脫離了鬥爭。—科薩列夫</p>
<p>作家應該同敎士一樣的不爲俗務所累。—愛默生</p>
<p>作家的笨是心靈的喉舌。—西萬提斯</p>
<p>我的文章不在表面，是在心靈里，有高超的心靈才有偉大的思想。……偉大可敬的作家，並不是以文字爲干祿的，只求賺錢的人，思想當然卑下。—盧騷</p>
<h3>「小型週刋與社會風氣」</h3>
<p>— 蕭寀</p>
<p>四月六日申報出版界欄載有厲生先生一篇「小型週刋與社會風氣」的文章，論及本市最近一般小型週刋的有傷風化，應予取締一點，眞是一針見血，令人稱快之論。</p>
<p>在八年浴血抗戰，剛勝利，建國工作百舉待興的現在，我們不敢說一般出版界所負的責任如何重大，應該負什麽樣的責任。但是與文化敎育有密切關係的出版物，直接可以影響靑年心身，間接足以轉移社會風氣，其對于國家民族前途，關係重大並不亞千學校敎育，則一般出版界之在建國伊始的大時代中所應該採取的態度之嚴肅與正當，當可不言而喻了。我們現在姑不論這些小型刋物的編輯和出版商的動機如何，但其影響結果之惡劣和嚴重，如對靑年思想的毒害，導入不正當的途徑，以及因此引起的社會風氣秩序之惡化等等後果，則是不容否認的事實。而喜歡閱讀這類低級趣味的刋物又多半是中學靑年和一般職業靑年如店夥工匠伕役之類，前者是未來社會的中堅份子，國家民族前途都利賴之，後者則爲佔都市中相當數量的基層工作者，其對于社會秩序的影響非常大。</p>
<p>厲生先生的文章中說由于「特老勃曼』一案，使巴黎小報銷售至五十萬份之多，其影響所及，使比利時和意大利兩國的罪案就因之增加。這種例子雖然並不能完全確定說是由于新聞報導所引起的後果，但是把某種不正當的新聞故作無謂的宣揚和渲染，如誨淫誨盜之類，不但對靑年無益，對社會無益，反而無形中給予靑年一種極壞的暗示，導入不正當的途徑。</p>
<p>記得從前曾有人提出舊式的連環圖畫的民衆讀物爲不當，正因其內容，或有消極頹廢墮落的人生態度的，或有違反愛國思想的，也有誨淫誨盜的，中仍其但有不少優良正當的故事，如愛國忠君尊師孝親一類，但是有一部份較之目前上海流行的小型刋物，不見得更壞些。那些舊式的民間讀物旣在取締之列，則在目前物資艱困，百廢待舉的建國時候，這類有害無益的小型列物更應該取締了。</p>
<p>由于八年抗戰的結果，收復區社會秩序散亂，人心不安，上海在敵僞盤踞的高壓之下，人們精神之苦惱與生活之抑壓，是多麼需要一種正當健全的人生思想和態度之啓示和領導，一種引向積極建國的途徑邁進的精神之鼓舞與開導，使這個全中國咽喉的大都市在政府的領導之下發揮出它應有的力量來。則這種領導上海民衆思想和精神，啓迪上海民衆智慧和力量的精神食糧，所負責任之重大可想而知了。爲上海的前途，更爲上海民衆的前途着想，希望當局澈底取締那些誨淫誨盜的刋物，推廣正當積極的民衆精神敎育。</p>

<p>作品是建立在作者醉厚的誠實上的。如果拿作品哄人，那麽第一個受哄的就是作者自己。—高爾基</p>
<p>爲了使用一點簡單的手法，費去了我多年的努力，辛苦，和硏究。現在我可以吿訴我的朋友—那班正在握着筆桿的人們：最高的藝術就是「汗」！要寫一句淸潔美麗的句子，總得把力量集中得濃濃地，再從筆尖上放射出去。—鄧肯</p>
<p>我所創造的每一樣東西，在我，全像一個詩人已有了道東西茁芽在他心的深處，因此，有火燄的閃耀，有生命的焚燒。—易卜生</p>

<p>任何人只要探窺到自己的心淵，再忠實地把所看見的寫出來，他就會獲得極多的讀者。—荷維</p>
<p>寫出來的東西，只要是發源於淸潔的心田的，縱然醜陋，還是一粒生命的子粒！—臺維斯</p>

<h3>The National Government Decides to Hold the Capital Relocation Ceremony on May 5th at the Mausoleum, and the Chairman Addresses Military Officers in Chengdu</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, dated 26th] The Executive Yuan's discussion meeting yesterday decided to hold the National Government's capital relocation ceremony at the Mausoleum on May 5th, concurrently holding a grand meeting to welcome Chairman Chiang. It is also reported that Chairman Chiang may return to the capital as early as the 28th after returning from Chengdu to Chongqing, and the Secretary-General of the National Government is preparing to accompany him to Nanjing. This morning, the National Government has begun arranging the Chairman's office.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, dated 26th] It was decided by the central government on the 25th that the joint memorial week of the Central Government and the National Government would be held in Nanjing starting next week, and the capital relocation ceremony will be held in Nanjing on May 5th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, dated 26th] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, Chen Qingyun, Minister of Overseas Affairs, and Kan Tongzi, Director of the Central News Agency, arrived in Nanjing at 2:50 PM today from Chongqing on China National Aviation Corporation's special flight No. 47. It is reported that Secretary-General Wu has been excessively burdened by national affairs and planning the capital relocation work in recent months, and his health is not well. He intends to transfer to Shanghai for medical treatment. Minister Chen will personally go to Nanyang to comfort overseas Chinese compatriots after the National Assembly. After disembarking, Director Xiao took a car to the Central News Agency's headquarters on Zhongshan Road to inspect the various departments of the agency for a week. He summoned the heads of various departments, inquired about the work situation, and then went to his residence on Luojia Road to rest.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, dated 26th] Ten more special planes for the capital relocation arrived today, carrying over 300 staff members from the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry of Overseas Affairs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, dated 26th] At 10:00 AM on the 26th, Chairman Chiang convened a meeting at the military academy's parade ground to address officers and students from various army and air force schools in Chengdu. Present were the Army Military Academy, the Air Force Staff School, the Air Force Military Academy, the Air Force Communications School, and the Air Force Mechanical School, with over 7,000 officers and students, as well as officers from the three Air Force Command Headquarters. Chairman Chiang encouraged them to strive for innovation in spirit, orderliness in life, and progress in knowledge and technology, so as to be worthy of being modern soldiers and completing the mission of building the army and the nation. After the speech, Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, also gave a brief speech, encouraging them to emulate Chairman Chiang's great wisdom, great benevolence, and great courage, and to cultivate the three qualities of tranquility, patience, and steadfastness, to shoulder the important revolutionary task and complete the revolutionary mission.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, dated 26th] Chongqing News: After the government relocates its capital, the Military Affairs Commission will be reorganized into the Ministry of National Defense, with one Chief of General Staff. Separate commanders will be established for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Logistics Department. It is reported that this reorganization plan is being planned by Chief of General Staff He, Deputy Chief of General Staff Bai, and Minister Chen Cheng. Minister Chen Cheng arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the morning of the 26th.</p>
<h3>Progress in Peace Negotiations; New Ceasefire Agreement in Northeast Expected; Marshall Changes Schedule to Arrive in Nanjing Early Next Week</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, dated 26th] Chongqing News: After the date of Special Envoy Marshall's trip was decided, the political situation, which had been turbulent for more than seven months, took a sharp turn for the better with the capital relocation climax. It is reported that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Democratic League have decided to send people to Nanjing to find housing. The CCP's office in Hongyan Village, Chongqing, is preparing to close. The US side has indicated that it will provide the most favorable transportation to assist in the relocation. It is reported that the Youth Party has found office space in Nanjing, and the government will provide convenience for all opposition parties to reside here. The situation may improve due to the relocation. Tonight, a certain National Assembly occupational representative jokingly told reporters that discussing politics in Nanjing or Lushan can broaden horizons, relax the mind, and enhance hearing, because the groans and wails of the small people suffering from the hardship of victory are especially poignant when heard coming from the southeast of the US.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, dated 26th] Well-informed observers believe today that a new agreement to halt the civil war in Northeast China is possible to be established by the weekend. Since returning from the United States, Special Envoy Marshall has been consulting with government officials and key KMT-CCP personnel, and has now postponed his trip to Nanjing until early next week. This has led to speculation that important developments may be imminent. Although no formal announcement has been made regarding the progress of the negotiations to date, Gillon is scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, dated 26th] Special Envoy Marshall and his wife were invited to Lin Yuan for lunch with Chairman Chiang before his departure from Chongqing to Chengdu on the 25th at noon. On the morning of the 26th, the Marshalls returned to Chongqing from the Shantung. No meetings were scheduled on Mr. Marshall's guest reception schedule today. The Marshalls may leave Chongqing and fly to Nanjing on the 29th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, dated 26th] Yishi Bao reported today that Special Envoy Marshall told the leaders of the Democratic League: "If the CCP can clearly state its demands and propose a political solution, the war in the Northeast can be stopped within 24 hours." This news has not been confirmed by Marshall's headquarters.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, dated 26th] CCP's Zhou Enlai reiterated tonight that the party regards "unconditional ceasefire" as the price for discussing the Northeast issue. Government spokesperson Wu Guozhen refuted Zhou's ceasefire method, saying: "An unconditional ceasefire in the Northeast would be tantamount to admitting that the CCP's violation of the January 10th ceasefire order was a legitimate act." Although the opinions of the KMT and the CCP are vastly different, Special Envoy Marshall has decided to stay in the temporary capital for at least two more days, hoping that both sides can reach a compromise solution. However, the Marshalls will remain in the temporary capital until at least next Monday. Chairman Chiang has now gone to Chengdu for a pre-departure tour and is scheduled to return to the temporary capital next Monday. If resolved according to Zhou Enlai's method, the CCP will control most of the Northeast, including Changchun and Harbin, which Zhou also believes to be true. Zhou also said: "Once the war in the Northeast ceases, we are willing to discuss the economic and political issues of the Northeast. We do not want to discuss the situation in the Northeast until the war ceases. When I exchanged opinions with General Marshall, I explained this point of view to Mr. Marshall. I am ready to sign a new ceasefire agreement based on an unconditional ceasefire today. I hope that once the war ceases, I will personally go to the Northeast with members of the military three-person group or others to investigate, and at that time I will inspect the CCP's Northeast Command and other cities in the Northeast. If the government provides transportation and housing, and negotiations are resumed, we can move our office to Nanjing at the beginning of next month. We are now willing to continue negotiating general issues such as government reorganization, but the government has no representatives staying in Chongqing to meet with us." The military reorganization agreement stipulates that five Nationalist armies and one Communist army should be stationed in the Northeast. It is reported that Zhou has requested to amend this agreement, but Zhou denied this, only saying: "Since the agreement was signed, the situation in the Northeast has changed greatly." At the same time, both the KMT and the CCP stated today that there is no new information regarding the war in the Siping Street area and the situation in Harbin.</p>

Sources concerned said that the continuous movement of Nationalist troops from South China to the north and Du Yuming's return to Shenyang to command will greatly improve the position of Nationalist troops in the Northeast and strengthen their takeover power. Military sources say that the Nationalist army has officially entered Siping Street Station, but transportation sources say that trains departing from Shenyang still terminate at Shuangmiaoxi Station, 20 kilometers from Siping Street.

Only by using unchanging truth to guide us can we safely get through it." Nimitz accompanied Eisenhower in praising the wartime achievements of the chaplains, saying that the number of casualties among chaplains when the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, and fought near Java was more than any part of the Navy.</p>
<h3>Relocation of Industrial Equipment from Northeast China: US Receives Soviet Reply, State Department Announces Ongoing Review</h3>
<p>[Washington, D.C., US News Agency, 25th] The State Department announced today: The Soviet reply to the second US note of February 9th, requesting a report regarding China's accusation that Soviet troops removed wartime spoils from Northeast China, has been received and is currently under review by the State Department. The Soviet reply was transmitted through the US Embassy in Moscow.</p>
<p>[Washington, D.C., United Press, 25th] According to unofficial but reliable sources: The US government considers the Soviet reply to the US regarding the relocation of industrial equipment from the Nine Eastern Provinces of China to be unsatisfactory. The Soviet reply was in response to the US inquiry in March and, in the view of some authorities in Washington, is tantamount to rejecting the US protest. The Northeast issue is crucial to the future of peace in Asia. The US has, in effect, accused the Soviet Union of removing all industrial equipment during its occupation of the Nine Eastern Provinces. The US, in its note to the Soviet Union in February, objected to the Soviet action, believing it to be inconsistent with the principle of the United Nations jointly handling territories and assets that belong to China and should be decided upon jointly by the United Nations, not unilaterally by one country. The Soviet Union issued a reply in early March, refuting the claim, stating that the Soviet army regarded Japanese industries in the Nine Eastern Provinces that had supplied the Japanese military as "war spoils" and that their removal was not inappropriate.</p>
<p>[Washington, D.C., United Press, 26th] Regarding the Soviet Union's possession of Japanese assets in the Nine Eastern Provinces, the Soviet Union has submitted a new note in response to the US. However, US officials feel dissatisfied and plan to re-examine the issue. According to diplomatic sources, US Secretary of State Byrnes is currently in Paris and may discuss the matter informally with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Officials here have clarified the US policy towards the Nine Eastern Provinces, which is twofold: (1) To find a way for the United Nations to agree on how to dispose of Japanese assets, and (2) To establish long-term economic policies based on Chinese administration of the Nine Eastern Provinces, to avoid bilateral agreements between China and the Soviet Union that would not give the US opportunities for investment and trade.</p>
<p>US Sends Pauley to Northeast China to Investigate Soviet Removal Quantities</p>
<p>[Washington, D.C., United Press, 25th] Regarding the Soviet Union's relocation of industrial equipment from the Nine Eastern Provinces of China, the Soviet Union today submitted a reply to the US inquiry. Sources familiar with the content say that its wording reaffirms the Soviet Union's past policy of regarding the industrial equipment as war spoils, and it advocates for joint Sino-Soviet management. US officials greatly fear that the Soviet Union will ultimately succeed in its insistence on these two points. If so, American commercial and political influence will not be able to reach the vast area of ​​Northeast China. To partially address this issue, President Truman has sent reparations commissioner Pauley to Northeast China to investigate how much industrial equipment has been removed by the Soviets. The US government believes that such an investigation is necessary to determine the Japanese reparations policy.</p>
<p>[Washington, D.C., United Press, 25th] The State Department has announced that Japanese assets inside and outside Japan will be used as reparations to compensate countries participating in the Pacific War. The State Department will establish a United Nations reparations agency to manage this. All movements of Japanese industrial equipment as reparations to various governments must be approved by the agency. Government requests for reparations should be based on wartime losses. Previously, there were requests for US representative to the Far Eastern Commission, McCoy, to make public the content of the US proposal to establish a reparations agency within the framework of the Commission. Secretary of State Byrnes issued notes to China and the Soviet Union on February 9, declaring opposition to any country of the United Nations unilaterally making final disposition of Japanese assets in Asia, and declaring that the US was prepared to make recommendations on reparations policy for consideration by the United Nations in the Pacific. He also stated that the US would sell industrial equipment and other assets received from Japanese reparations, but the US would not take any action to receive and distribute Japanese assets as part of reparations until all United Nations agreed to this policy.</p>

<h3>Guiding Idle Capital into the Right Track: The Government Resolves to Suppress Speculation, Yu Hongjun Talks About Finance and Economy to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun received reporters from various newspapers at his office in the Jianghai Customs yesterday afternoon, and kindly answered the questions raised. The main points are recorded as follows: Mr. Yu said that the most important task for finance and economy at present is how to guide idle capital and channel it into production. Since the government opened the foreign exchange market and sold gold, the gold and exchange markets have stabilized. The government now holds abundant foreign exchange and gold, and is determined to strike at speculators so that they cannot use their manipulative tricks. Strengthening the organization of exchanges is also a major way to guide idle capital into the right track. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai this time, he is listening to opinions from all relevant parties and is carefully discussing the resumption of exchanges. It is believed that the resumption of various exchanges is imminent. Regarding the government's various tax revenues, Mr. Yu believes that the principle is to avoid hindering production and the development of the national economy. In recent months, the income from customs, salt, and unified taxes has increased significantly. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee passed the introduction of new taxes such as property tax, exchange tax, transaction tax, and comprehensive income tax; preparations are now actively underway, and the tax rates for each item are not very high. As for the registration of puppet currency, the deadline has been set for the end of April. After the deadline, the handling methods will be determined based on the amount and nature of registration in various places, ultimately aiming to benefit the general public and prevent speculation by unscrupulous people. Finally, regarding the request of customs employees yesterday to adjust their salaries, Mr. Yu said: The Commissioner of Customs, Li Du, Deputy Commissioner of Customs, Ding Guitang, and Director of Customs Administration, Zhang Fuyun, have requested instructions for this matter. He firmly stated that the government had already decided that the treatment of customs employees should be the same as that of civil servants. Therefore, he personally instructed and urged all colleagues to temporarily endure the difficulties and work with peace of mind. Mr. Yu earnestly stated to the reporters that the current period is a time for working hard, and he does not want to make many speeches. However, since the reporters have shown such enthusiasm in asking questions, he must answer to the best of his knowledge to satisfy the enthusiasm of the news media. It is heard that Mr. Yu will not stay in Shanghai for a long time and will return to the capital within a day or two for official business.</p>
<p>[Shanghai, Central News Agency] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and will return to the capital within two days to preside over the relocation of the Ministry of Finance. The main task of Mr. Yu's trip to Shanghai is to inspect the various institutions under the Ministry of Finance, and to conduct on-site investigations into the situation of various exchanges in the city, consult with the financial community on resumption methods, and discuss effective measures with local authorities to crack down on speculation, attract foreign capital, and guide it into production, in order to stabilize the city's finances, increase production, and naturally lower prices. In the morning, Mr. Yu visited President Song of the Central Bank, and at 9 o'clock, he went to the Jianghai Customs for inspection. He then returned to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance and met with Li Du, Commissioner of Customs, Ding Guitang, Deputy Commissioner of Customs, and Zhang Fuyun, Director of Customs Administration, to listen to their reports. According to Mr. Yu's statement to reporters, customs revenue is increasing daily. As of the 20th of this month, more than one trillion yuan in customs duties have been collected, exceeding the total revenue for the entire previous month by more than one-tenth. At 10:30 am, Mr. Blandford, an American consultant to the Ministry of Finance, visited Mr. Yu to provide a detailed analysis of the content of the national budget and discussed the general financial situation of China. The discussion lasted for an hour and a half. Afterwards, Mr. Yu also met with Wei Xianzhang, Director of the Central Mint, and gave instructions.</p>

According to legal regulations, the registration procedure for National Assembly representatives should begin ten days before the opening of the session.

However, some representatives from various places have not received the notice in time and are already en route to Nanjing. In the next day or two, they will arrive successively. For the convenience of reception, the Preparatory Committee has decided to continue handling the registration procedure, and will suspend the registration in a day or two, and will issue another notice for handling after the opening of the Assembly has a definite date.</p>
<p>[Nanjing, Reuters, 26th] The Heping Daily (Peace Daily) stated today: The National Assembly may be held on May 15. Under the mediation of Special Envoy Marshall, the Communist Party has agreed to submit the list of National Assembly representatives before May 15.</p>
<h3>Representatives in Nanjing Discuss, Hoping to Open the Assembly as Scheduled</h3>

Over two hundred people attended, and Ma Yuanfang was elected as chairman. Representatives Qi Zhihou, Wu Xianglin, and Zhu Huiqing spoke successively, all focusing on the issue of the National Assembly being postponed. It was decided to hold the first National Assembly Preparatory Meeting on May 1 and issue a declaration, hoping that the government would not be hindered by a few political parties and would convene the National Assembly as scheduled. He Bingru, a representative from Shandong, was appointed to urge the National Assembly Preparatory Committee so that its work would not be relaxed due to the postponement. According to Wu Peng, a representative from Silingol League in Mongolia, there are still over twenty Mongolian representatives who will travel to Nanjing from Xi'an and Chongqing in separate airplanes.</p>
<h3>Representatives from Guangxi and Jiangsu Talk About the Situation in Guangxi and Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, This Newspaper, 26th] Lin Hu, a representative from Guangxi, told this newspaper's reporter that seventy-three of Guangxi Province's ninety-nine counties had been occupied by the enemy. The people, after surviving the war, are now suffering from disasters. More than ten million disaster victims throughout the province are starving. The situation is so tragic that it is beyond description. The most severely affected areas at present are He County and Lipu County, which are in urgent need of relief. Xia Dingwen, a representative from Jiangsu, who recently arrived in Nanjing via Qingdao from Donghai, said that some of the communist troops in Northern Jiangsu have moved north. The people flee wherever the troops go, and the villages become ruins. There are no signs of human life for dozens of miles. The Xuzhou-Lianyungang section of the Longhai Railway, although repaired after being destroyed by the communist troops on January 14, has not yet been opened to traffic. Currently, the area twenty miles west of Donghai and thirty miles east of Tongshan are controlled by the communist troops. The communist troops are carrying out the so-called "cruel struggle" in their occupied areas, causing more than 30,000 refugees to flee to Donghai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Assembly Representatives Met Yesterday, Deciding to Go to Nanjing Before May 2nd, and Telegraphing Representatives Elsewhere to Report on Time</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai Branch of the National Assembly Fraternity Association held its eleventh meeting at the association's headquarters in the Pudong Building. They expressed concerns about the postponement of the National Assembly. The representatives who attended were Xi Yushu, Zhou Xuexiang, Chen Guanying, Cheng Zhonghang, Zhu Xuefan, Pang Shusen, He Yuanming, Ye Yunhui, Ding Zhongying, Niu Jingting, Ye Xianggao, Chen Chuxiang, Hu Shuqian, Wang Qizhang, Chen Chaoxiu, Tang Qi, Li Shengbo, and over twenty others. The meeting was chaired by Xi Yushu, who reported that after the government formally announced the convening of the National Assembly, it suddenly announced a postponement. Although the government has its own difficulties, the representatives have a heavy responsibility entrusted to them by the voters, and they cannot remain silent. Moreover, many representatives from various places are already on their way to Nanjing, and it is better to continue to move forward and gather in the capital to concentrate their efforts to seek advocacy. The discussion then began, and the above opinions were used to draft a telegram, which read: "To all newspaper offices across the country and to the National Assembly Fraternity Associations of all provinces and cities: The central government has expressly postponed the National Assembly. We firmly believe that it will be held soon. We hereby telegram to all National Assembly representatives en route across the country, please continue to move forward and gather in the capital before May 4. During the period of postponement, we can exchange views with each other on the draft constitution and important issues in Nanjing and make suggestions. We hope you will take this into consideration. Shanghai Branch of the National Assembly Fraternity Association." It was also decided that the representatives in Shanghai should gather and report in Nanjing before May 2. After the meeting, Xi Yushu told reporters that when he was inland, he had tried his best to advocate the speedy convening of the National Assembly. Unexpectedly, due to various reasons, the opening date has been postponed again and again, which is deeply regrettable. The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau originally planned to add special carriages for the convenience of the National Assembly representatives to Nanjing, but after learning of the postponement of the meeting yesterday, this measure was also shelved. Now that the representatives still intend to go early, transportation is quite inconvenient. Most of the Shanghai representatives are busy with the municipal councilor election, so they will have to wait until after the 29th before they can go to Nanjing. Xi Yushu received an urgent telegram from Nanjing yesterday, but he has postponed his departure due to the election.</p>

<h3>Wu Tiecheng Arrives in Nanjing, Talks About Feelings on Returning to the Capital</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, Central News Agency, 26th] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, after flying from Chongqing to Nanjing on the 26th, expressed his feelings about leaving Chongqing and returning to the capital. Mr. Wu first stated that the victory of the War of Resistance and the government's return to the capital were the most meaningful "major events" in the history of our country. The people of the whole country should also be happy and encouraged, and deeply grateful that our rivers and mountains are safe. However, during the period of national construction in the future, we should still uphold the spirit of hard work and endurance of soldiers shedding blood and people sweating during the war, reorganize the old rivers and mountains, and build a new China. The government of our party is seeking peaceful unification, unity, and returning power to the people, and the determination to implement constitutional government is completely the same as the urgent desire of the people. Mr. Wu then talked about the National Assembly issue, saying that the various parties have been slow to submit the list of representatives, which has led to the postponement of the assembly and affected the government's credibility. However, the government, in order to accept the opinions of the public, has expressly ordered a postponement of the convening, and this measure is enough to show that the government tolerates and compromises on all issues that are conducive to peaceful unification and unity. At present, government representatives are preparing to continue consultations with all parties. Wu also quoted a Western proverb, "Good Things Come Last," hoping that future consultations will be conducted smoothly. Wu continued to describe his feelings about leaving Chongqing. He had lived in Chongqing for eight years during the war. When he left this morning, he witnessed the beautiful scenery of the Jialing River and the mountains and forests, and remembered the friendship of the people of Chongqing, and could not help but miss it. Finally, when reporters asked about the postponement of the National Assembly and other issues, Wu replied that the National Assembly would be convened after satisfactory results had been obtained from consultations with all parties. He stated that the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee would be held in the capital starting next week. Wu also said that the delegations of various parties will soon return to Nanjing from Chongqing, and the government has prepared housing and transportation for them.</p>

<p>Four Pig Merchants Murdered by Bandits</p>
<p>According to a report from Wuxing, a boat from Yixing was moored at Niudian Bridge outside the West Gate of the county. The boat owners, Zhong Abing, Shen Songyuan, Lü Genli, and Zong Longzhi, were selling piglets there. Local residents exchanged rice for the piglets, totaling more than sixty dan (a unit of dry volume equal to one hectoliter). Unfortunately, bandits noticed this and gathered six or seven others, murdering the four boat owners by drowning. Recently, corpses began floating to the surface. The county authorities, upon receiving the report, ordered the detective team to conduct a secret investigation and intensify efforts to solve the case. It was learned that the bandits had hidden in Linghu. Detectives rushed to Linghu and found that Cui Xiaoting from Hengtang was the main culprit in the case, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. His father, Cui Agan, was detained for questioning, and miscellaneous rice bags, tools used on the pig boat, and pig food buckets were found in his home, along with three piglets. The father of the victims identified them as belonging to the boat. It was also discovered that the stolen rice, more than sixty dan, had been loaded onto a boat and transported to Hangzhou for sale. There are reportedly more accomplices in the case who are still at large. A strict search is underway to bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Convening of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference</h3>
<p>The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference was convened in Paris on the 25th. The convening of this conference is a continuation of the "unfinished business" of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in London last month. The previous Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in London ended without agreement on the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, and was handed over to the Deputy Ministers Conference to reach an agreement and draft treaties. However, in the past three months, the Deputy Ministers Conference has worked hard but has not made progress, and the deadline of May 1 for the convening of the peace conference in Paris is fast approaching. On the 4th of this month, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes informed the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union of his regret over the slow progress of the Deputy Ministers Conference and proposed that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers should meet in Paris on April 25 to decide on the convening of the peace conference on May 1. The United Kingdom and France first expressed their agreement, and the Soviet Union subsequently agreed. Therefore, the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference was able to be convened in Paris on April 25 as scheduled. The Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union are now happily gathered together. The convening of this Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is to discuss the drafting of the peace treaties and the preparation for the peace conference. If an agreement can be reached, it will be extremely important for the future of Europe. Whether the peace conference scheduled to be held in Paris on May 1 can be convened as scheduled depends on the outcome of this Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. If this Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference can reach an agreement on the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, then the peace conference on May 1 should not be difficult to convene as scheduled; the problem lies in whether an agreement can be reached.</p>
<p>The main issue of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, as is well known, is to find an agreement on the peace treaties with Italy, Finland, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. Originally, the peace treaty with Finland was drafted by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union; the peace treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary were drafted by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union; and the peace treaty with Italy was drafted by the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, so far, the peace treaty with Finland has only been discussed separately by the Soviet Union and Finland, and the United Kingdom has never participated. No agreement has been reached on the peace treaties with Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria either. The most difficult issue is the drafting of the peace treaty with Italy, where the positions of the various parties are very far apart. Because the distance between them is so great, there is doubt as to whether this Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference can reach an agreement on the peace treaty with Italy. London does not have too much optimism about the convening of this Foreign Ministers Conference, and the views in Washington are somewhat the same. If this Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference cannot reach an agreement on the peace treaty with Italy, then the convening of the peace conference on May 1 will inevitably be postponed. The convening of the Foreign Ministers Conference at present is only an attempt to break the deadlock, and breaking this deadlock is indeed very difficult.</p>
<p>The main reason why the peace treaty with Italy has so many difficulties is still the division of territory. Before the war, the Italian "Empire" controlled the Dodecanese Islands in the eastern Mediterranean, Libya in North Africa, and Somaliland and Eritrea in East Africa. Now that Italy has been defeated and surrendered, how should these places be disposed of? The Dodecanese Islands are located in the eastern Mediterranean, and their bases are of great strategic value, enough to control the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East. The Soviet Union advocated handing them over to Greece for safekeeping, originally wanting to use Greece to expand the Soviet Union's influence in the Near East. This obviously conflicts with the interests of the United Kingdom, and the United States also does not want to see the expansion of Soviet influence, which would be enough to control the eastern Mediterranean. This is one reason why the peace treaty with Italy is difficult to agree on. Regarding North Africa and Italian East Africa, the Soviet Union wants to obtain sole trusteeship. If this is approved, the Soviet Union's influence will extend to the central Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, and the Suez Canal, which is the lifeline of the British Empire, will be seriously threatened. This is another thing that is difficult for the United Kingdom and the United States to accept. This is the second reason why the peace treaty with Italy is difficult to agree on.</p>
<p>In addition to the problem of dividing the former Italian colonies, there is also the problem of further dividing the territory within Italy itself. The area of ​​Fiume-Trieste was originally a very complicated area. Before the First World War, it belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but the residents here were Italians and Yugoslavs. After the First World War, the writer D'Annunzio raised the banner of righteousness in Fiume, and the area was returned to Italy. Trieste originally belonged to Austria and had Yugoslavs. Now Yugoslavia is demanding that it be划归划归to that country; and Yugoslavia, under the rule of Marshal Tito, is very close to Moscow. If Yugoslavia obtains Trieste, it is equivalent to the Soviet Union's influence extending to the Adriatic Sea, which is in direct conflict with Britain's traditional policy of controlling the Mediterranean. This is also a major factor that makes the peace treaty with Italy difficult to agree on. In addition, there is the Tyrol problem on the Austrian-Italian border, which originally belonged to Austria and was inhabited by Austrians and Italians. It was ceded to Italy after the First World War and remains so to this day. Of course, in addition to the issue of territorial division, there is also the issue of Italian reparations, and the opinions of various countries have not been一致.</p>
<p>In general, the main reason why it is difficult for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to agree on a peace treaty is that "power politics" is at play. Some countries are trying to dominate the world and want to expand their influence everywhere. This attempt will inevitably conflict with the original forces; therefore, agreement is difficult to obtain. According to the current situation, there is no doubt that the reason why it is difficult to agree on a peace treaty is that the policies of the Soviet Union are too far apart from the policies of the United Kingdom and the United States. The interests of the United Kingdom and the United States are not exactly the same. Their policies also have differences, but the attitudes of the United Kingdom and the United States towards the above-mentioned issues can be said to be somewhat similar. China does not participate in the drafting of the European peace treaty, which is obviously inconsistent with the principle that war cannot be divided and peace cannot be divided. However, since our allies are in charge of drafting the European peace treaty, even if we do not directly participate, we believe that international justice will still be upheld. We wish the Foreign Ministers Conference success!</p>

<h3>Optimism Permeates Foreign Ministers Conference; Soviet Union Shows No Sign of Concession on Balkan Treaty Issue; Agrees to Participation of United States and France; U.S. Representative Brings Proposals to Eliminate Tariffs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 26th Telegram: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers held their second meeting in the Luxembourg Palace today. They first discussed the procedures decided yesterday, and then began to discuss the first item on the agenda, the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Italy. Discussions were still ongoing at the time of the broadcast. French Provisional President Gouin hosted a banquet tonight to entertain the foreign ministers of the four countries.</p>
<p>Of those in attendance today, the British Foreign Minister arrived first, and the Soviet representative arrived last. The Soviet delegation was very large, consisting of six cars. No communique will be issued as a result of today's meeting. It is expected that no official communique will be issued until the conference has reached a definitive result.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 26th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference was held in the Luxembourg Palace today. The Soviet Union showed flexibility on the issue of the right of the United States and France to participate in the treaty negotiations of the five Axis satellite countries, so the atmosphere at the meeting was harmonious. The Soviet Union's rejection of France's participation in the treaty negotiations with Bulgaria, Hungary, Finland, and Romania was the main reason for the failure of the London Foreign Ministers Conference last winter in September. The United States did not fight with Finland, and the United States will also be granted the right to attend the treaty negotiations with Finland. However, it is understood that the United States may not actually join the vote during the treaty with Finland. France can participate in the peace treaty negotiations of the five Axis satellites, but can only participate in the vote on the treaty with Italy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 26th] At the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the new European peace treaty, the Soviet Union declared that it would allow France to participate in the discussion of the peace treaties with the Balkan countries. This move has created a new atmosphere of optimism at the meeting. Molotov's statement that he would allow France to participate in the discussion of the Balkan peace treaties changed his decision announced at the London Foreign Ministers Conference last year, which was quite unexpected. Mr. Molotov said that he did not object to French observers attending the discussions on the Balkan countries and Finland, and the U.S. representative would also attend the discussions on the Finnish peace treaty, but without voting rights. The news spread, and representatives from various countries were quite optimistic, saying that Mr. Molotov's move may indicate that Moscow will also ease its attitude on other issues.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 25th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes is traveling to France to attend the Foreign Ministers Conference, bringing important proposals in the hope of breaking the deadlock in the European peace issue. Its content advocates that European countries abolish tariffs, implement free trade, and set a five-year period to accelerate the economic recovery of the European continent. However, Byrnes' advisors have conflicting opinions on this.</p>
<h3>First Meeting Ends Without Results</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 25th] According to official news tonight: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers held their first meeting in the Luxembourg Palace tonight, discussing the Balkan and German issues. As soon as they made contact, conflict arose. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and French Foreign Minister Bidault proposed that this conference should discuss and resolve the Ruhr issue. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov immediately expressed strong opposition. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 p.m. without any results.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers held their first meeting here yesterday under strict security. According to a communique issued by the French Foreign Ministry last night: The first meeting decided on the procedures to be adopted at this Foreign Ministers Conference, and then discussed the agenda of this conference. The Luxembourg Palace, where the meeting was held, was under extremely strict security. Only twenty or thirty senior representatives were allowed to enter the meeting place, and all others without special entry permits were turned away. The meeting room was in the Victor Hugo Memorial Hall in France, and the representatives sat around a round table. Bevin, Byrnes, Molotov, Bidault and the other four foreign ministers sat in armchairs, while the other attendants sat in chairs without armrests. Each foreign minister had an interpreter. Before the first meeting, each foreign minister had submitted a proposal on the procedures of the meeting, advocating that each foreign minister take turns serving as chairman. France was the inviting country, so Bidault served as chairman yesterday. The first item on the agenda was the content of the Italian peace treaty. It is generally expected that this Foreign Ministers Conference will continue for ten days to three weeks. Bidault said, "If it can help the agreement, I am willing to meet for two months to complete it."</p>
<h3>Molotov</h3>
<p>Brought Bodyguards to the Meeting Place</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] Molotov arrived at the Luxembourg Palace yesterday afternoon to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, accompanied by eight burly Soviet soldiers as bodyguards.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Opposes Sending an Investigation Team; Security Council's Discussion of the Spanish Issue Reaches a Tense Stage; Representatives of Australia, France, and Poland Reach an Agreement; Agree to Review Each Representative's Previous Remarks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: The Security Council's discussion of the Spanish issue has entered its most tense stage today. After the regular meeting began, the Australian representative immediately announced that the representatives of Australia, France, and Poland had reached a resolution after a night of consultation, agreeing to appoint a subcommittee to review the remarks made by each representative in the Security Council on the Spanish issue and to report to the Security Council as soon as possible. The meeting was then adjourned and rescheduled for discussion next Monday, where each representative will vote on whether to pass the resolution.</p>
<p>Today's meeting lasted only five minutes, the shortest of all meetings.</p>
<p>The content of the agreement reached by the French, Polish, and Australian representatives is as follows: "The Security Council is now paying attention to the situation in Spain and has been requested to declare that the Spanish situation does indeed endanger international security and peace. The Security Council, in view of the moral condemnation of the Franco regime by all parties, and the resolutions passed by the San Francisco Conference and the United Nations General Assembly on this issue, has decided to further review whether the current situation in Spain has endangered world security. If so, it will recommend practical measures to the United Nations. To achieve this task, the Security Council has appointed a five-member subcommittee to review the statements made by representatives in the Security Council and to conduct various necessary consultations in order to submit a report to the Security Council as soon as possible."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 25th] In the Security Council today, Soviet representative Gromyko strongly opposed sending a committee to investigate the Spanish case. The representatives debated each other for three and a half hours. Motions and amendments were proposed one after another, sometimes confusing some representatives. As a result of the debate, no resolution was reached.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: Bulgaria has announced the severance of diplomatic relations with the Franco regime, and the Bulgarian Embassy in Spain has been ordered to close.</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Body Still Missing; Strange Letter Found on Coffin</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 25th] Interior Minister Romita announced today that a small number of people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of Mussolini's body. According to the Milan Police Chief, two cemetery night watchmen have been arrested, but it is not yet known whether they are among those arrested by Romita. It is rumored that Mussolini's body has been secretly reburied in Predappio. Romita denied this, saying that there are no clues as to where his body is now.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Milan, 26th] After Mussolini's body was stolen, a letter addressed to Mussolini was found on his coffin, signed by the "Central Committee of the Fascist Democratic Party." Milan newspapers only excerpted a few paragraphs of the letter and published them, with the general meaning: "Your Excellency Prime Minister, you are finally with us. We have asked the authorities to hold an honorable burial for your remains, but have been refused," and so on. The National Political Police of Italy have all been mobilized to search for Mussolini's body.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 25th] A Rome newspaper warned today that Italian fascists may use the myth of resurrection to make people believe that Mussolini has been resurrected.</p>
<h3>International Financial Institutions to Commence Operations Early Next Month; Presidents to be Elected Separately by Boards of Directors</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 24th] The International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, now informally referred to as the "World Fund" and the "World Bank," are scheduled to formally commence operations on May 6th and 7th. At that time, the two boards of directors, composed of representatives from twelve countries, will hold separate meetings. Their first order of business will be to elect the presidents of the two institutions. It is expected that it will take two months before financial and balancing operations can commence. The Monetary Fund is temporarily housed in a Washington hotel, and both institutions are seeking permanent addresses. It has been suggested that former U.S. Budget Bureau Director Douglas be appointed as President of the International Bank, and that Treasury Secretary Gode be appointed as President of the Fund. The annual salary for both positions is $30,000, tax-free. Denmark has formally joined as a member state. The United States, Britain, China, France, India, Canada, and Belgium, and the Netherlands all have representatives on the boards of directors of both institutions.

<h3>Cabinet Formation Order for Japan to be Issued Imminently; Progressive Party Excluded; Four Parties Continue Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Our Tokyo Correspondent, 26th Dispatch] It has been five days since the Shidehara Cabinet resigned, and Shidehara has yet to recommend a new prime minister to the Emperor. Today at 4 PM, Shidehara visited the Imperial Palace to meet with the Emperor. It is rumored that he recommended a new prime minister to the Emperor, but according to reliable sources for our reporter, this rumor is inaccurate. After Shidehara's resignation, he engaged in negotiations with the Liberal, Socialist, and Cooperative parties in his capacity as leader of the Progressive Party, in order to form a new cabinet. As a result, the Socialist Party demanded a premiership position in the new cabinet, but the Liberal and Progressive parties did not agree, and the negotiations broke down. Since last night, the situation has changed again due to the alliances and separations of the parties.</p>
<p>The most notable aspect is the exclusion of the Progressive Party. After Shidehara became the president of the party, he hoped to form a "coalition government" of the Liberal, Socialist, and Progressive parties. The Liberal Party agreed to this proposal, but the Socialist Party consistently refused to allow the Progressive Party to participate. As the meetings between the Liberal and Socialist parties evolved into four-party meetings, Shidehara's ambition was clearly thwarted.</p>
<p>[Reconstruction Daily Tokyo, 26th] The committee of the Liberal, Socialist, Cooperative, and Communist parties of Japan reconvened its meeting at 5 PM today to discuss the prime minister issue. It had not adjourned by 7 PM. Socialist Party Secretary-General Katayama has obtained the agreement of the meeting to visit Liberal Party President Hatoyama tomorrow for important talks. It is widely believed that the structure of a joint cabinet of the Liberal and Socialist parties will be achieved, and the order to form a cabinet is expected to be issued in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Results of The Hague Negotiations Fail to Satisfy East Indies; Negotiations Soon to Continue in Java</h3>
<p>[United Press Amsterdam, 25th] East Indies Interior Minister Soedharsono, having completed the negotiations in The Hague, stated on the eve of his departure back to Java that the negotiations between the Indonesian and Dutch governments did not meet his expectations. Details of the negotiations cannot be disclosed before reporting to Prime Minister Sjahrir, but it can be said that the negotiations were fruitless in both form and content. It is reported that the Dutch side had urged the East Indies delegation to postpone their departure until Saturday so that Dutch East Indies Governor-General Van Mook could participate in the final negotiations. The East Indies delegation refused this request and decided to depart by plane this morning. Van Mook and his advisors will also depart for Java on the 30th of this month. The negotiations between the Indonesian and Dutch governments began on the 9th of this month, during which sporadic fighting continued in Java. The Netherlands proposed granting the East Indies dominion status, while the East Indies demanded that Java and Sumatra be formed into a free state. The Netherlands would temporarily retain sovereignty over the other islands in the East Indies as a compromise.</p>
<p>Dutch Government Statement</p>
<p>[Reuters The Hague, 26th] The Dutch government issued a statement declaring that although the difficulties between Indonesia and the Netherlands have not been completely resolved, progress has been made on several points. The Dutch government has now been able to submit this issue to the Parliament, which will provide opinions as a basis for Dutch East Indies Lieutenant Governor Van Mook to continue negotiations in Java.</p>

<h3>Secret of German Recording Machine Discovered by U.S. Army; By Connecting This Machine to a Telephone, the Other Party's Words Can Be Recorded</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 26th] The secret of the magnetic recording machine used by German submarines has been discovered by the U.S. Army. When the Nazi Party was in power, the telephones of foreign diplomats, journalists, and other suspicious individuals were secretly connected to these machines. Every word spoken during the call was recorded on the machine. Inside submarines, these recorders could be used to detect the sound of ship propellers and locate enemy ships. In peacetime, if this machine is installed on a telephone, it can also record the other party's words when the owner is not present. A journalist can report the day's findings to the machine without having to return to the newspaper, and simply send the audio recording to the newspaper.</p>

<h3>Seeing the American Recovery on the Streets of New York (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>New York, with a population of seven million, is now not only an American city, but also a global metropolis. On the streets of New York, if you walk along Broadway or cross Forty-Second Street, you can see people of various skin colors, hair types, and eye colors, all equally busy with their affairs. The difficult war is over, and there is no trace of war on the streets of New York. The bright red and green neon lights illuminate every street and corner of New York. The war destroyed the ancient European modern civilization and damaged the budding industries of Asia, but for the New World, it has become more robust and prosperous than ever before.</p>
<p>New York is not only a city of industrial and commercial production and trade, but also a city of massive consumption. An American economist estimated that 75 percent of the total industrial production in the United States is consumed by women. This is perfectly demonstrated in New York. Don't believe it? Step into large companies such as "Bonwit Teller" and "Macy's," and you will notice that most of the customers upstairs and downstairs are American ladies. In New York, the most difficult item to buy now is stockings, especially the transparent and durable "nylon" type. This does not mean that the United States lacks stocking production. In fact, the United States is currently the country that manufactures the most stockings (followed by Switzerland), simply because American women consume them too much. Often, when a batch of stockings arrives at a store, an advertisement is published in the newspaper, and the next day, people immediately line up to buy them, and the goods are sold out in less than half a day.</p>
<p>In New York, it is not only stockings that are difficult to buy, but also Arrow or "Manhattan" brand dress shirts, which are very difficult to find, and each purchase is limited to one item. Before I came to the United States, my friends in Europe all thought: "Just put up with it for now, once you get to the United States, you can have whatever you want": However, the reality is not like that. It is said that the population of New York is increasing daily. The average purchasing power after the war boom is astonishing. Some of the industries that were stalled by the war have not yet fully recovered. Therefore, production and consumption are often disconnected invisibly. To give a very obvious example, there are several typewriter companies in the United States. Before the war, they were all capable competitors in the international market, but now they do not have sufficient production to meet the needs of the domestic market in the United States. In New York, if you want to buy a "Remington" typewriter, you must pre-order it two months in advance. Many people are eager to use one and cannot wait that long, so they buy readily available Swiss products. It is said that light-weight typewriters made in Switzerland have experienced unexpected sales in the United States in the months since the end of the war. Even though the U.S. Customs imposes high taxes on industrial products from Europe, many people are still willing to pay a high price to purchase them. At the same time, on the other hand, I heard a friend say that the "Remington" company is spending a large amount of money commissioning talent to design a "Chinese typewriter," in order to compete for the vast market in China in the future. A famous Chinese writer has already designed a fairly perfect plan, which is being tested by the Remington company.</p>
<p>The capitalist economic system puts the market first. Currently, many American exporters know the importance of the Chinese market. However, up to this stage, they are still taking a wait-and-see attitude. They believe that the exchange rate in China is not stable enough, and they are afraid of suffering losses in future exchange rate fluctuations. More than 20,000 bales of Japanese raw silk have already been shipped to New York. The New York Post used a rather eye-catching headline saying: "No worries about stocking materials." It also provided numerical estimates that 20,000 bales of raw silk can produce tens of millions of pairs of stockings. Isn't our China a country known for its silk? Aren't we also paying attention to export trade?</p>
<p>I believe that what is even more scarce than stockings and typewriters in New York is housing. The British Conservative Party government collapsed in last year's election because it did not have enough houses for the citizens of London. Paris, France, did not suffer from war damage, but finding a house is even more difficult than reaching the sky. It's no different in New York. The other day, I met Yang Yongqing, the former president of Soochow University. He had just received a letter from home, saying that Shanghai and Nanjing are having difficulties finding houses. "The housing shortage has now become a global problem." Whenever a war passes, the population is bound to be heavily concentrated in cities. Concentrating in cities, the city's housing becomes a problem. It is said that before the war, although the population of New York was already very large, it was still easy to find houses in the Manhattan area. In the upper part of Manhattan, the windows of laundromats often had advertisements posted for houses for rent. This time when I came to New York, I searched for three days according to the map, but I didn't see a single advertisement. The old laundromat owner just shook his head. Several large courtyards ran a very narrow classified advertisement in the New York Times. The New York Times is published at one o'clock in the morning. At one thirty, someone drove a car to reserve the rental. From two o'clock onwards, until the next day, the phone rang non-stop, all wanting to rent the house. The landlady really couldn't stand it anymore and took the receiver off the hook: "This is really annoying, it's not like we're the only house in all of New York!" The landlady frowned and told me this story. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>It is Said That Shi Yu is Very Eloquent, Shifting All Blame; Many Sophistries During This Morning's Public Trial; Claimed His Conduct Was Different From Ordinary Traitors</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Shi Yu, who successively held the positions of puppet Minister of Railways, puppet Minister of Construction, and puppet Governor of Zhejiang Province, was arrested by military authorities after the victory. He was transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation, which concluded with a public prosecution. Yesterday at 2:30 PM, the High Court held a public trial. Because the court had pre-issued admission tickets to limit the number of spectators, order in the courtroom was well-maintained. Family members of the defendant, wearing dark glasses, also attended the hearing. When Shi's daughter passed by him as he was being escorted back to prison, she softly called out "Papa," to which Shi responded with a somber silence. At just after 2:30, Court President Liu Yugui, along with Judges Cai Jin and Qiu Huan-ying, Prosecutor Dai Rong, and Clerk Yang Daqi, took their seats. The defendant looked dejected and unwell, and was escorted onto the stand by two court police officers. Shi was wearing a gray gabardine jacket and black satin shoes with white soles. His temples were already streaked with gray, and his eyes were bloodshot and sleepy. He held in his hand a written confession he had prepared in prison. He stood at the defendant's stand.</p>
<p>Court President Liu first asked his age, native place, address, and occupation. He replied that he was 56 years old, from Wenzhou, residing at 41 Avenue Albert, and previously worked in education. Next, Prosecutor Dai stated the main points of the indictment, divided into several points: conspiring with an enemy nation to collude with the Japanese, carrying out the "cleansing the countryside" campaign, expanding the puppet security forces, issuing public bonds, and paying tribute for warplanes. (See yesterday's newspaper for details of the indictment.) Court President Liu then asked the defendant if he had any defense. Shi then took out and put on his glasses, took out the white paper from his hand, and said he could</p>
<p>Respond to Each Point Separately</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the indictment's claim that he colluded with the enemy under the guise of inspecting railways, the defendant said that in November of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940], he was ordered by the puppet Executive Yuan to lead two section chiefs and two secretaries to Japan for inspection, staying for more than ten days, but that there were no other consequences. He had no interactions with any elements of the Japanese government or public. He said that he had studied mining engineering and had been unemployed before the incident. During the war, he took up puppet positions under various unavoidable circumstances. However, the duties he undertook were all passive in nature, and he never had any intention of colluding with the enemy. (2) Regarding the three points mentioned in the indictment about carrying out the "cleansing the countryside" campaign, expanding the puppet security forces, and paying tribute for warplanes, the defendant said that he was already serving in a puppet position at the time, and of course could not completely disregard orders from superiors. At that time, the puppet army was of poor quality, so he reorganized it to alleviate the suffering of the people, taking over from the enemy. The weapons were inferior, and the number of personnel was even smaller than before, so there was no question of expansion. The purpose of the reorganization was to prevent them from acting as bullies and harming ordinary people, and to instill patriotic ideas in them. Therefore, many puppet security forces were able to liaise with guerrilla units, exhausting the enemy. The defendant often warned them that enduring temporary grievances was not important, and that they must work together to serve the country during the general counter-offensive. As for carrying out the "cleansing the countryside" campaign, it was done on the orders of the puppet "Cleansing the Countryside" Committee. Wang Jingwei served as the chairman of the committee, Zhou Fo-hai and Chen Gong-bo served as vice-chairmen, and Li Shi-qun served as the secretary-general. The name "cleansing the countryside" also originated entirely from Japanese demands. The military aspects were the responsibility of the Japanese, while the Nanjing government was only responsible for administrative matters. The target was the New Fourth Army. The defendant was originally unwilling to carry out this matter, but there were orders from superiors. In reality, "cleansing the countryside" was just empty talk, impossible and meaningless. Regarding the payment of tribute for warplanes, it was a general order issued by the puppet government to all provinces and cities in the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943]. At that time, Shanghai paid a total of 50 to 60 million, while Zhejiang delayed repeatedly before paying 4 million puppet currency. Therefore, the prosecutor's claim that Zhejiang paid 14 million is inaccurate. (3) Regarding the issuance of construction bonds, it was the responsibility of his predecessor as Minister of Construction, Chen Jun-hui. The defendant served as puppet Minister of Construction for a very short period. At that time, the military situation was tense, and all land and water transportation was under enemy control. Therefore, apart from water conservancy projects in Danyang County and East Taihu Lake, there was no other work. Although he served in a puppet position, he always aimed to love the country and save the people. As for going to Nanjing in March of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940] to take up a puppet position, it was entirely due to the urging of Mei Si-ping and the Shanghai enemy military police. The defendant went on to list many pieces of evidence to the contrary, saying that his going to Nanjing to take up a puppet position was with the consent of Mao Zhao-zhi of the Military Intelligence Bureau, and that he often provided information afterward. Later, Mao was captured by the enemy, and the defendant arranged for his release. Mao led his son, Mao Jing-quan, to Nanjing to thank him before going to the interior. After the Pacific War broke out, he came to Shanghai from Hong Kong again and introduced Guo Zhen to serve as the puppet police chief of Wuxing, to act as a military liaison. He also introduced Wu Li-xing to go to Ningbo to be responsible for liaison. He also instigated the puppet troops of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to plan for internal support during the counter-offensive. Later, Mao died of illness in Shanghai on April 23rd of that year, and his son entered the puppet Ministry of Construction, holding the nominal title of specialist, and is now also working in the Military Intelligence Bureau. In addition, he successively bailed out Zheng Qing-ken, a member of the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, Gong Wei-zhen of the Three Youth League, Kong Qing-shi of the Loyal National Salvation Army, Chen Zhong, and others. The Fourth War Zone's Tang En-bo sent Zhang Yu-lin and Xu Fu, and the Zhejiang Loyal National Salvation Army's Ruan Qing-yuan sent Yang Chong-ming, to contact the defendant. At that time, Wu Pei-yun, the director of both KMT party branches, came to Shanghai and went to Nanjing with Chen Gong-bo to discuss how to coordinate the counter-offensive. Therefore, although the defendant served in a puppet position, his attitude was always for the country and was not the same as that of ordinary traitors. He asked the court to make a clear judgment. The defendant also listed various pieces of evidence against the Japanese collection of military rice. At this point, Prosecutor Dai</p>
<p>stood up again to supplement, saying that the defendant had also served as a member of the puppet Central Political Committee and a member of the Materials Control Committee. The defendant admitted to all of this without hesitation, but said that they were only nominal titles and that major decisions were made by Wang, Zhou, Chen, and others. The court then questioned Shi using transcripts of speeches made by Shi published in puppet newspapers at the time. Shi replied either "mistaken" or "no such thing." As for the Japanese government awarding Shi a second-class medal, he replied that it was an exchange between the Japanese and Nanjing governments. However, the defendant only saw it in the newspaper and never received it. When asked about the procedures for liaising with the counter-offensive, he replied that there were puppet security forces in Zhejiang, Ren Yuan-dao and Xu Bo-cheng in Jiangsu, Sun Liang-cheng in northern Jiangsu, and a puppet garrison division in Nanjing. Finally, when asked about the defendant's assets, he answered with a bitter smile, saying that the defendant was a teacher and had no assets. The trial came to an end here. The defendant requested that Ruan Qing-yuan, Zhang Yu-lin, Mao Jing-quan, Xu Fu, Yang Chong-ming, He Pei-rong, and Li Qi be summoned for questioning next time.</p>
<h3>Ai Ji-cheng, Sun Zu-ji Indicted, Summoned for Trial This Morning, Xu Ji-dun and Others</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Chen Ji-cheng (puppet ambassador to Manchukuo and concurrently chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee) and Sun Zu-ji (successively puppet director of finance of Zhejiang, director of the Insurance Supervisory Bureau, and mayor of Hangzhou) have been investigated by the High Procuratorate, which has concluded the investigation. Public prosecutions have been filed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the office also summoned and interrogated Zhang Lian-fang, Zhu Shun-lin, Cheng Zhi-liang, Liu Quan, Lu Bing-yuan, Qian Jie-yi, Wang Wei-cai, Feng Wen-qi, and others.</p>
<p>This morning at 9:00 AM, the treason case of Xu Ji-dun, Xie Zhong-fu, and others will be tried.</p>
<h3>Three Traitors Sentenced, Sarri Displays a Stubborn Attitude</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The High Court yesterday announced the sentences in several treason cases: (1) Jiao Bai-quan, secretary and concurrently chief of the enterprise section of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government's Propaganda Department, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights. (2) Kang Lu-qiao, the puppet chief of Sanlin Town in Shanghai County, and Kang Fu, the puppet chief of Nanxing Township, were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights. Wang Fu-qi, the director of the Joint Office of the Seven Townships of Sanlin Town, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and three years of deprivation of civil rights. The property of all the above defendants will be confiscated, except for a portion to be reserved for the necessary living expenses of their families. (3) The case of Feng Yao-fu, a translator for the enemy military police, was transferred to the local court due to a jurisdictional error.</p>
<p>Sarri, the former deputy director of the French Concession Police, and his assistant, Aminov (the chief inspector of the police force), were arrested and transferred to the High Procuratorate for investigation and public prosecution because they had assisted the Japanese, harmed Chinese merchants and residents, disrupted our war efforts, and supplied the Japanese with military supplies during the war. Yesterday morning, the High Court opened a trial. Sarri was unusually stubborn, claiming that the Chinese court had no jurisdiction but said he did not plan to protest. He pleaded innocent. The other defendant, Aminov, denied wrongdoing. Subsequently, Baodaxiang Silk Store and Ding Fangyuan described the defendants' acts of extortion. The court ordered a postponement for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Third Route Army Military Tribunal Accepts More Than Thirty Cases</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Liu Shi-fang, the president of the Third Route Army Headquarters Military Tribunal, told reporters yesterday: The tribunal is currently handling more than 30 cases, involving more than 80 war criminals. However, two-thirds of them lack witness testimony and physical evidence. These war criminals, who cannot be investigated, will be returned to the prisoner of war management office. The reporter was surprised by Liu's remarks, as many citizens had reported enemy crimes to the local court's procuratorate. When asked about this, Liu immediately replied that the purpose of these reports may often be to take revenge. Because most people cannot confirm the names of these war criminals when reporting, they cannot be considered strong evidence in practice. Liu's current rank is major general, and he wears a grass-green military uniform, but his conversation is humorous and still reveals the character of a scholar. He once told his friend: "Ordinary people always call me Dr. Liu or Professor Liu. One day, when I was having dinner with some foreign friends, they kept calling me 'General.' I didn't know who they were talking to. Later, I saw them looking at me, and I realized they were talking about me!" His sense of humor is evident.</p>
<h3>President Truman's Personal Representative, Hoover, to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover, a personal representative of President Truman, is currently visiting various parts of the world at the behest of the U.S. Relief Committee to assess the food situation. According to reports, Hoover is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon, and the U.S. military authorities are preparing to welcome him. After arriving in Shanghai, Hoover will stay at General Wedemeyer's former residence. It is reported that Hoover will stay in Shanghai for three or four days, but there are no definite plans to go to Nanjing or Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Two "Female Stars" on the Blacklist, Xia Peizhen Cries Upon Hearing the Verdict, Yuan Meiyun Not Allowed Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] In the case of Xia Peizhen's drug addiction, the local court sentenced her to one year in prison yesterday afternoon and ordered her to be sent to a hospital for detoxification. Xia cried loudly after hearing the verdict.</p>
<p>The drug addiction case of movie star Yuan Meiyun was reopened by the Third Criminal Court of the local court at 3:00 PM yesterday. Before 2:00 PM, the audience seats were already full, and there was almost no room for latecomers. Some even climbed onto the windowsills to watch the trial. Yuan was still wearing the red plaid coat and black cheongsam from the initial trial, with black satin flower shoes on her feet. Her attitude was calmer than before, but her voice was very low. It is said that she had smoked opium because of stomach problems, but was afraid of becoming addicted, so she stopped and started from time to time. Recently, because the police bureau banned drugs, she has been detoxifying and switched to drinking medicinal liquids. She also hired Dr. Cao Zishou to treat her. Because the witness, Dr. Cao Zishou, had not arrived, the situation of Yuan's detoxification could not be proven, so the court adjourned the trial to another date. Yuan also hired lawyers Yue Junwei and Huang Menggang to appear in court yesterday to defend her and requested bail, which the court refused. (The picture shows the situation when she was sadly on trial)</p>
<h3>Measures for the Use of U.S. Cotton Loans Determined</h3>
<p>According to the Central Bank, the procedures for the use of the 33 million U.S. cotton loan have been determined. Detailed procedures have been notified to designated banks, foreign exchange brokers, cotton importers and factories, and cotton trading companies. This loan can be used to pay for U.S. cotton that arrives on or after March 4th of this year, but the purchase contract must be notified to the Central Bank before September 14th of this year, and the U.S. cotton must be shipped before March 14th of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947]. All of the above conditions (including U.S. cotton that has been sold but not yet settled) are eligible for this loan. The new measures stipulate that the sale of this U.S. cotton and the application for foreign exchange will still be handled according to customary practices, but all U.S. cotton, unless specifically authorized by the Central Bank or because the collateral is not in compliance, will be paid for in accordance with the new measures. This U.S. cotton loan will be handled by the Bank of China as designated by the government and the Central Bank, but U.S. cotton buyers can still handle foreign exchange settlement procedures at any designated bank.</p>
<h3>Tricycle Pullers Petition for Licenses, Return Satisfied</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] A delegation petitioning for licenses for newly manufactured tricycles in the city, along with more than 1,000 people from eight tricycle companies, took hundreds of vehicles to the city government yesterday morning to petition for the issuance of licenses to maintain their business. Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau met with them on behalf of the mayor. Zhu Wenguang and other representatives of the tricycle companies stated three points: (1) Each vehicle is borrowed at high interest rates by two or three pullers, and the livelihood of several families depends on this vehicle. (2) Before the Public Works Bureau issues licenses, please notify the police bureau not to detain them. (3) 1,400 tricycles have been registered by the eight companies, and it is requested that licenses be issued as soon as possible. Director Zhao then replied to the representatives with two principles decided by the municipal government meeting: (1) Privately owned vehicles must be registered at designated locations within five days. (2) Vehicles owned by the companies that are damaged will not be registered. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<h3>Case of Abuse of Five Filipinos, War Criminals Sentenced in Three Days</h3>

<h3>All Movie Theaters to Resume Business, Method of Assigning Seats Temporarily Allowed to be Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Because of the assigned seating issue, eight of the city's 39 movie theaters were ordered to close by the police bureau. The theaters appealed, but there was no result, leading to the suspension of all performances at 2:00 PM yesterday. In the morning, Li Diyun, the managing director of the Movie Theater Association and manager of the Dahua Theater, went to the city government to meet with the mayor for discussions. After the mayor brought it up at the municipal meeting, there was still no satisfactory result. Subsequently, Xu Jiqing, the chairman of the Municipal Temporary Council, and Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, jointly submitted a petition to the mayor. The mayor then approved the resumption of business of all theaters (including the eight closed theaters). The method of assigning seats is temporarily allowed to be postponed. Therefore, all theaters resumed business starting with the evening performances.</p>

<h3>A Word in Yixuan, the Mei Troupe's Performance Has Three Difficulties, Finally Solved Smoothly - A Pity -</h3>
<p>Starting today, the Mei Troupe officially performs at the Nanjing Grand Theater, with a scheduled performance period of twelve days. If possible, it may be extended for a few days after the twelve-day period expires. Shanghai people have been separated from Dr. Mei for a long time. Although he performed several Kunqu operas last time, Kunqu is ultimately highbrow and unpopular. People who like to listen to Peking opera cannot help but feel slightly disappointed. With this public performance, people can enjoy a great Peking opera performance.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter and Mr. Ni Qiuping, a famous piano ticket in the city, specially went to Lantian Road to visit Mr. Mei. Usually, Mr. Mei hums in his residence, and Mr. Ni plays the piano. Unfortunately, Mr. Mei and Mr. Wang Qinsheng went out to visit guests, but we saw Mr. Xu Lanyuan, who had been separated for ten years, and chatted happily in the quiet Xueyixuan. It turned out that this performance can really be said to be extremely difficult. First, the Mei Troupe is famous, and every new tune always sweeps the country. However, Xu Lanyuan is extremely busy in Beijing. He has shares in Zudelou, and Zhulanzhuan (a famous bamboo shop in Beijing) also needs him to preside over it. He has never played the strings for eight years of war. This time, it was Dr. Mei's friendship that made him fly to Shanghai. Wang Shaoqing used to play the huqin for Li Shifang, but did not play the erhu. This time, it was also the first time in eight years that he played the old tune. In addition, Wang Qinsheng's huqin is Yang Shizhong, so this performance is a collection of three masters of Jinghu and Erhu, not to mention the vocalization, it is enough to listen to the interlude.</p>
<p>Second, it is difficult to find supporting roles. Although Wang Qinsheng's name seems unfamiliar in Shanghai, he is indeed a rising star with unlimited prospects. He is the top student of Tan Xiaopei and has long been popular in the old capital. The pure role is still Lian Rong, the old partner when he went to the United States, and the young student is Jiang Xiangmiao. Yu Zhenfei, it seems that selling horses still has the possibility of being staged.</p>
<p>Third, the most difficult thing is the place - I didn't expect that even "King Mei" had to exhaust his efforts to find the Nanjing Grand Theater! If it weren't for help from many parties, it would simply be a hero with no place to use his "talent". The Nanjing Grand Theater has never performed Peking opera, and the rental fee is quite considerable. According to their estimates, there is very little certainty of making money in this performance. Mei Wanhua has always been righteous and generous in his life. The main purpose of this performance is really to repay the millions of Mei fans.</p>
<p>In order to adjust the crowding, the first program "Cosmic Front" will be performed for three consecutive days, and the second program is "Bao Lian Deng", which will probably be performed for two consecutive days.</p>
<p>Mei Dawang's eldest son, Bao Chen, has also returned from Chongqing, and he has been busy setting up the ticket stalls these days. It looks like a full house for twelve consecutive performances is stable.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Allied Military Tribunal to Open Within Ten Days; Prosecutor Xiang Zhejiong Arrives in Shanghai on Official Business</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Tokyo, from General MacArthur's Headquarters: Mr. Xiang Zhejiong, the Chinese prosecutor for the United Nations Military Tribunal, flew to Shanghai on an American military plane on the 24th for official business. When interviewed yesterday by a reporter, he said that the number of countries participating in the tribunal has reached eleven. In addition to the nine countries that accepted Japan's surrender, India and the Philippines have recently joined. The trial will officially open within ten days. However, it may be postponed for some time after it opens to allow the defendants sufficient time to prepare their defense. The estimated duration of this trial is five to six months, but if it is not completed by then, it will have to be extended. China has collected a great deal of evidence, which is currently being translated into English with great haste. Mr. Xiang's stay in Shanghai will be short, and he will fly back to his post in two or three days.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 25th] According to the Far East International Tribunal Prosecutor's Office: The indictment against Hideki Tojo and other major Japanese war criminals has been printed and bound, and will be submitted to the International Tribunal no later than next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>City Councilors Election Tomorrow; a Whistle Will Signal the Start of Citywide Voting; Mayor to Broadcast Election Significance Tonight; Planes to Drop Colorful Leaflets</h3>
<p>The election of city councilors for this city will be held tomorrow. At six o'clock in the morning, a whistle will be blown to signal the start of voting for citizens, which will continue until six o'clock in the afternoon. If necessary, it will be extended until ten o'clock in the evening. The more than one thousand public office candidates participating in the election will then be determined, and the city's one hundred and eighty-one councilors will be officially elected. The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Bureau has made all the necessary arrangements for the election procedures. The one hundred polling places throughout the city will be selected by each district. If needed, each district can add one or two more to facilitate voting. To encourage citizens to pay attention to voting, the Municipal Government, with the approval of the Aviation Committee, has dispatched planes to drop leaflets at nine o'clock this morning and nine o'clock tomorrow morning. Mayor Qian will give a broadcast speech on the significance of the election at nine o'clock tonight on the Shanghai Radio Station. The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Bureau has appointed fifty-eight election supervisors and assistants to monitor the public voting in each district. For the sake of caution, the Municipal Government has specifically sent a letter requesting the city's first Provisional Councilors to mobilize and observe in all election districts and professional groups. The Secretariat of the council approved the letter and has sent notices to each Provisional Councilor to participate.</p>
<h3>Whether Executives of Puppet Organizations Can Participate in the Election</h3>
<p>There has been some doubt as to whether those who served as directors and supervisors of professional organizations under the puppet regime can participate in the election. The Shanghai City Councilor Election Office has submitted a request to the Ministry of Interior, which was then forwarded to the Executive Yuan for interpretation, stating in brief: Those who served as directors and supervisors of professional organizations under the puppet municipal government are, in accordance with Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, prohibited from being candidates for public office for a certain number of years. As for how long this "certain number of years" should be, it should be determined by the Executive Yuan in consultation with the Examination Yuan, and further orders will be issued. This interpretation has been sent by the City Election Office to the Social Affairs Bureau, which will in turn notify all relevant organizations.</p>

<h3>Meeting with General Ma Zhanshan; Willing to Use the Waters of the Songhua River as Ink and the Lush Forests of the Heilongjiang River as a Brush to Paint a Portrait of General Ma</h3>
<p>— Special Reporter Zhao Haosheng, Chongqing Air Dispatch, 20th of This Newspaper</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan's fame and achievements are as radiant as the perennial snow on the peaks of Changbai Mountain. "Ma Zhanshan" is a glorious name forever associated with "the Northeast"! As the global war that arose over the Northeast issue has ended victoriously, today, the Northeast issue has once again become a matter of global concern, and those who care about the Northeast issue are all watching General Ma Zhanshan's movements.</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan arrived in Chongqing a month ago, coming from Datong via Beiping. Seeing General Ma, the reporter felt as if he was seeing the anti-Japanese history that began in elementary school in his memory. This sixty-two-year-old general is still heroic and magnanimous, as brilliant and active as the heroic history he has written over the past ten years.</p>
<p>Signature for this newspaper, Long flight, slightly haggard after illness.</p>
<p>He was wearing a new-style army uniform made of grass-green homespun. His lean and not-so-tall figure looked truly slightly aged. However, his spirit, his heroism, was as strong as ever. He had a short, flat haircut, and his silver-white hair roots were shining brightly. His face was full of vitality, and although lean, it was by no means as slack as that of the average elderly person. This time, he came from Beiping, and the long flight was tiring. After getting off the plane, he fell ill. The day the reporter saw General Ma, his complexion was still showing signs of post-illness fatigue.</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen General Ma will remember his eyes full of moving power. Those eyes, which are not very big, have a bright and piercing brilliance, embedded in his gaunt face, appearing deep and majestic. From those eyes, you can know how General Ma's history of more than ten years of heroic fighting was written, and you can be even more certain that this sixty-two-year-old general has not aged.</p>
<p>Pure accent, full of cordial charm</p>
<p>General Ma speaks with a pure Northeastern accent. That accent is deep, sonorous, full of simple, sincere, cordial, and moving emotions. General Ma has a commonly used phrase, which is—"That's what I always think in my head." The pronunciation of the word "that," in particular, fully expresses the special charm of the Northeastern dialect.</p>
<p>When General Ma talked about his anti-Japanese war of more than ten years, his explanation was very simple: after the "September 18th Incident," it was to disrupt the enemy so that they could not occupy the Northeast peacefully. The volunteer army led by General Ma became a symbol that the Northeast would not fall. General Ma's fame was the source of the enemy's perpetual unease. At that time, no Japanese soldiers or civilians did not know General Ma Zhanshan, and none did not respect and fear General Ma Zhanshan. They had pictures drawn everywhere and offered rewards for capturing General Ma. In the end, they even deceived themselves and displayed General Ma's clothes, hats, and leather boots in Japanese exhibition halls, propagating that General Ma had been killed. This shows how great a threat General Ma posed to the enemy!</p>
<p>Advanced age, not yet time to retire</p>
<p>After the anti-Japanese war in the Northeast came to an end, General Ma originally intended to rest, but then came the "July 7th Incident," and a full-scale anti-Japanese war broke out. General Ma accepted the orders of the supreme leader without hesitation and took on the responsibility of Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Advance Army, Northeast Pacification Envoy, and Chairman of Heilongjiang Province. For the past eight years, General Ma has been facing off against the enemy in various parts of Shaanxi until the victory of the War of Resistance. After the victory, General Ma felt that his mission was complete, and that he was old and should rest, so he earnestly requested his resignation from Chairman Chiang. This time, when he was summoned to Chongqing, he again requested to resign in person. However, as one elderly speaker said at a welcoming meeting: "Not only will Chairman Chiang not allow General Ma to resign, but the people of the whole country will not allow General Ma to resign."</p>
<p>Northeastern compatriots, love the country and love the leader</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation in the Northeast, General Ma has a decisive judgment, which is "absolutely not to allow the existence of illegal forces." This sixty-two-year-old man has the most ardent love for his country and homeland, and therefore he hates those who undermine peaceful reunification. He said even more firmly: "The people of the Northeast love the country and love the leader. This enthusiasm cannot be insulted by any force." At the same time, he eagerly anticipates the peaceful construction of the Northeast. At a welcoming meeting for overseas Chinese in Chongqing, he said that he was willing to be an introducer. He asked overseas Chinese to actively invest and develop in the Northeast. He is now employed as the Chairman of the Northeast Nine Provinces Guidance Committee of the China Production Promotion Association. He hopes to contribute to the construction of his homeland.</p>
<p>Historical guarantee, write greater achievements</p>
<p>During his twenty-nine-day stay in Chongqing, he was summoned by Chairman Chiang several times, and flew back to Beiping ten days ago. This old general, who has been closely connected with the Northeast for more than ten years, has a very high level of influence in the Northeast. Today, when the Northeast is in a state of extreme chaos, General Ma's movements are indeed the most valued by the people of the whole country. History will guarantee that General Ma will use his shining pen to write even more glorious achievements for the country and his homeland!</p>
<p>With this wish, the reporter dipped into the clear ink of the Songhua River and used bright colors as lush as the forests of the Heilongjiang River to create the above portrait of General Ma of the past, present, and future.</p>
<p>General's thoughts, recalling ten years of war history</p>
<p>In the preceding paragraphs, I have given a general portrait of General Ma Zhanshan as I saw him before leaving Chongqing. From the old general's brow and the wrinkles carved by war and time, people can see many serious and heavy emotions buried in his heart.</p>
<p>In Chongqing, I met a leader who had followed General Ma Zhanshan in the anti-Japanese war during the Northeast Volunteer Army period and talked about one of the old general's most heavy-hearted concerns. This is a story from more than ten years ago, a story that has only been confirmed over the past ten years, and a deep yearning.</p>
<p>After the "September 18th Incident," General Ma Zhanshan led his subordinates, renting many Northeastern youths, and launched a war against the rulers. They fought under extremely difficult conditions. The first period was to use the enemy's weapons to wage large-scale wars, and the second period was to wage guerrilla warfare. It was during this period that the enemy drew pictures and offered rewards for capturing General Ma. It was also during this period that the enemy displayed General Ma's clothes and hats in the exhibition hall, propagating that General Ma had been killed.</p>
<p>The army led by General Ma constantly maneuvered with the enemy. Finally, due to the increasing pressure from the enemy and their lack of supplies and ammunition, although a large-scale fundraising and support movement had been launched in Guannei, it could not reach the soldiers. In this desperate situation, General Ma led his basic force of 20,000 people to retreat into Soviet territory. At that time, the Soviet government treated them very well, which they were very grateful for. Soon, they moved from Soviet territory to Xinjiang. However, after arriving in Xinjiang, only 14,000 of the original 20,000 people remained. In addition to the 1,000 who died of disease or deserted along the way, there were still 5,000 people left in Soviet territory. These 5,000 people were all young students who had joined the volunteer army out of patriotic enthusiasm.</p>
<p>An important knot in the current stage</p>
<p>It is said that these soldiers left in a foreign country have been rigorously trained by the Soviet Union in the past ten years. However, because communication with the country has been cut off, General Ma misses their lives very much.</p>
<p>Of the 14,000 people who flowed to Xinjiang, many were killed by Sheng Shicai in the past ten years. General Ma also often remembers the exile life of these ten thousand people with great concern.</p>
<p>Now the War of Resistance has been won, and the difficult days of the past ten years should come to an end. General Ma has recently received letters from his former subordinates in Xinjiang, requesting General Ma to find a way to send them home immediately. General Ma has presented this matter to Chairman Chiang in person and is planning to properly settle them so that they can each find their place and be demobilized together with the national anti-Japanese forces. It is said that the 5,000 people left in the Soviet Union have now all appeared in the Northeast.</p>
<p>In the chaos of the Northeast, the kinetic energy of these 5,000 people in the chaos has become a matter of concern for those who care about the Northeast issue and has become an important "knot" in the complex Northeast issue.</p>
<h3>An Account of the "Liberated Area" in Northern Jiangsu: The True Face of Punishing "Traitors" and Governance</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ming</p>
<p>I am a poor teacher from northern Jiangsu. Recently, the "Democratic Government" in our "Liberated Area" in northern Jiangsu launched a campaign to punish "traitors." Although I never participated in the puppet organization, because I had received considerable education, the instructors and local chiefs often came to my residence to "pay their respects." How could I bear so many "respects"? Therefore, I had no choice but to flee to Shanghai half a month ago. Now, I am writing down what I personally witnessed in the so-called "Liberated Area" in northern Jiangsu and submitting it for your readers' consideration.</p>
<p>"Self-Renewal" Registration</p>
<p>After the Communist army "liberated" each city, it ordered a group of puppet officials to undergo "self-renewal" registration and organized "Current Affairs Study Groups" to train them in batches. Three "guarantees" and four "requirements" were proposed at the meetings. The so-called three "guarantees" after the training were: (1) guaranteed status (with civil rights), (2) guaranteed property (even corrupt wealth would not be investigated), and (3) guaranteed employment. The so-called four "requirements" were: first, to absolutely believe in the "Democratic Government"; second, to be thoroughly honest (past political experiences must be confessed); third, to accuse (those who worked under the central government must accuse their former superiors); and fourth, to report (those who did not surrender themselves as traitors or were not honest enough must be reported). Upon graduation, a portion was selected to work for the "Democratic Government," and the rest were dismissed and sent home. At the time, the puppet officials were grateful for the great virtue of the "Democratic Government."</p>
<p>"Public Trial" Work</p>
<p>However, recently, the "Democratic Government" has revealed its true face. It not only rigorously launched a campaign to punish "traitors," but also eradicated "three capitals" (intellectuals, the bourgeoisie, and people of reputation). The method was to establish public schools and grievance committees in each town, forcing one person from each proletarian household to participate. The public schools did not teach literacy but carried out reporting and trial work. Each school had a school committee (one person from each unit) responsible for investigation, clearly investigating a group of puppet officials, "three capitals" elements, etc., and reporting to the instructor, or the students could report them. Then, they would be arrested by the Public Security Bureau and taught to confess to the public at the public school. After the confession, the people would conduct a "public trial." Whether it was truly the people's will, only heaven knows!</p>
<p>Regarding "public trials," there were also the following types: (1) those with property were fined rice (never money); (2) those with knowledge, reputation, or so-called "national agents" were sentenced to imprisonment, shackles, and confinement. In serious cases, a mass meeting would be held, and they would be executed by shooting; (3) for petty traitors, those with insufficient knowledge and no money, they would be detained in "people's prisons" (not allowed to leave their residence within a certain period); (4) for special circumstances, they would be tattooed on the face and paraded through the streets; (5) for those who could not deliver the rice fines on time or whom they deemed necessary, their property would be confiscated (all indoor items would be taken away).</p>
<p>Since the launch of the so-called "punishment of traitors" campaign and the "eradication of three capitals," everyone has been panicking, fearing imprisonment and rice fines. Those with money fled to Tongzhou, Yangzhou, Shanghai, and other places, while intellectuals and people of reputation without money had no choice but to flee to other lands, determined to "rather starve to death outside than be slaughtered." If the government were to count the number of refugees from northern Jiangsu, the number would be considerable. Among them, many are ambitious people who are now wandering the streets, hoping that the government will pay attention and find ways to help them.</p>
<p>Thorough Eradication Campaign</p>
<p>"Thorough rent and interest reduction" and "guarantee of rent and interest payment" are policies touted by the Communist Party, but the style of the district and township political commissars and the peasant resistance committee members is baffling. Recently, they believed that the past investigation and reduction were not thorough, so they re-implemented it. The method was to reduce rent based on the number of fields owned by the landlord. If the calculation showed that the landlord still had something to gain, it would be considered "reversed rent," that is, the rent reduction would be retroactive, calculated from the time the New Fourth Army arrived in northern Jiangsu in 1940. In this way, landlords not only did not benefit but also had to borrow rent notes from the tenants, in addition to paying public grain and taxes. As a result, they could only hand over the fields to the tenants.</p>
<p>Self-Defense Movement</p>
<p>Recently, the Communist army has again expanded the militia organization in northern Jiangsu, calling it the "self-defense movement." In practice, the township cadres are concentrated for training by district. Now they have graduated and returned to work in various townships, reorganizing the strong men who were originally in the militia into district guerrilla squadrons. The original district guerrilla companies were reorganized into county guard regiments, and the original county guard regiments have now been reorganized into a certain column of the New Fourth Army and transferred to southern Shandong and then to the northeast. The current militia organization consists of strong men aged 18 to 40, regardless of whether they are only sons or the amount of property they own, all must join. Therefore, from the current situation, the eligible strong men in the countryside are all militiamen.</p>
<p>Relief Movement</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu is the only large rice-producing area, but recently, because the Communist army transported rice from Haibei, an unprecedented famine has formed. Now the "Democratic Government" stipulates that people eat two meals a day and are not allowed to eat fish or meat, and the following three teams are formed to carry out activities:</p>
<p>A. "Eat-Up Team": Those who eat three meals a day or have surplus food at home are led by the township committee to gather and eat, like a flock of sparrows, until it is all gone.</p>
<p>B. "Smell-Fragrance Team": Upon smelling the fragrance of fish or meat, they gather at the house to eat together. They have a "Smell-Fragrance Team" dedicated to this task.</p>
<p>C. "Demolition Team": Recently, the Communist army has been building bunkers in various strongholds, organizing demolition teams to specialize in demolishing the property of counter-revolutionaries (puppet officials and "three capitals") houses, and demolishing a portion to the so-called base areas for the "people" to live in together.</p>
<p>Special Operations Organization</p>
<p>The intelligence and dispatch work of the Communist army is extremely meticulous. I cannot know the details, so I will briefly record the semi-public special operations organization that has recently been implemented among the people as follows:</p>
<p>A. "Reconnaissance Team": The people hate the Communist army to the bone for everything they do. The "Democratic Government" authorities, in order to detect "reactionary" people, organized a reconnaissance team to specialize in reconnaissance. If two people walk together on the road, the reconnaissance team will follow behind to find out what they are talking about. Restaurants and taverns also often have personnel specializing in intelligence work.</p>
<p>B. "Listen-to-the-Wall Team": The job of the "Listen-to-the-Wall Team" is to specifically listen to people's words and actions at home. When they think someone is suspicious, they will be arrested and taken to the official office.</p>
<p>Economic Activities</p>
<p>The only currency in northern Jiangsu now is the anti-Japanese currency. There are many types of anti-Japanese currency, including "circulating notes," "anti-Japanese notes," "old anti-Japanese," "new anti-Japanese," "Jianghuai" notes, "Huazhong" notes, etc., with dozens of types. The value of old and new anti-Japanese currency is different, which makes all the people have a headache. In the past, during the "puppet currency" period, anyone carrying puppet currency would have it confiscated, but in fact, they themselves still used it among the people. For example, a few months ago in Gaoyou, someone from a certain tax office used puppet currency, which was discovered by the people and caused a disturbance at the county government. The county magistrate, Gu Weihan, still protected them, which incited a city-wide strike. Now, legal tender is also not allowed to circulate in the market in northern Jiangsu, and private use is confiscated, but it can be exchanged for "anti-Japanese currency" at the Huazhong Bank at a rate of forty to one. The amount of legal tender received by the Huazhong Bank every day is very large. The people all ask what is the use of the "Huazhong" taking away the legal tender since it is not allowed to circulate in the market?</p>
<p>The burden on the people in northern Jiangsu is to pay "money and grain" and "public grain" in the countryside (now pre-collecting for the second half of the year), and merchants in towns and cities pay "business tax" and "goods transit tax." In addition, there are joint burdens such as "clothing donation," "comfort donation," "shoe donation," "quilt donation," district waiting "anti-Japanese family donation," "martyr's family donation," "honorary soldier donation," and dozens of other types.</p>
<p>In terms of economic policy, if the price of goods in the recovered areas rises, the "Democratic Government" increases the value of the "anti-Japanese currency," so that the price of goods in the "Liberated Area" remains unchanged when calculated in anti-Japanese currency. If the price of goods in the recovered areas is low, causing materials to flow inward, the import tax is increased, leaving merchants with no profit to be made. For example, northern Jiangsu used to have a surplus of rice, which was mostly transported to Jiangnan. Recently, because the Communist army bought and transported it, the price of rice has risen to 1,100 yuan per stone in "anti-Japanese currency," equivalent to 40,000 yuan in legal tender, while the rice in Changshu and Jiangyin in Jiangnan only costs 200 yuan per stone in "anti-Japanese currency." If it is transported from Jiangnan to northern Jiangsu for sale, an import tax of 200 yuan in "anti-Japanese currency" is added per stone, making it unprofitable. Merchants have since hesitated, and the lives of the people are even more bitter.</p>
<p>Merchants, in addition to not using shop assistants and engaging in small-scale sales to maintain their livelihoods, all large stores, if they continue for another three months, not only will they run out of all their goods, but the owners will also go bankrupt and liquidate. This is because the "Democratic Government" has established the Jianghai Company and the Yumin Company, which use "anti-Japanese currency" without funds to acquire large amounts of legal tender and purchase large quantities of materials from other ports, taking the upper hand. Conversely, merchants need capital, and there are heavy "anti-Japanese taxes," so the cost is high, the people are in deep water, purchasing power is weak, business is slow, and in addition, shop assistants demand salary increases, surrounded by enemies on all sides, how can they not collapse?</p>
<p>Inside Education</p>
<p>Primary and secondary education in the "Liberated Area" focuses on meeting ceremonies, promotes "democracy," and sings more than teaches. Middle school students can choose courses, and they don't have to listen to courses they don't like. If teachers interfere, it is not "democratic." The only specialized courses are New Democracy, Marxism-Leninism, and a new outlook on life. Subei Public School is run in Dongtai Dazhongji, and a branch school is set up in Shagou Dingsuo. No matter what level you are, you can go to school. You graduate in three months and are assigned to work in various basic units. In this school, in addition to providing food and lodging, even pocket money is given, so many young people are absorbed. There are usually twenty or thirty teams in the school, each team a company of more than a hundred people. In addition, excellent cadres are sent to study in major middle schools in the recovered areas, and children of the people are encouraged to study abroad and given subsidies. The purpose is worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>Transportation in the "Liberated Area" is intermittent. Highways are built along the base areas, and cars can pass through. Near the recovered areas, the highways are destroyed. At the border, there are checkpoints where anyone suspicious is immediately detained. The countryside is also filled with militiamen who check pedestrians anytime and anywhere. Finding legal tender is an unexpected fortune. If they are happy, they may even reward you with a meal.</p>
<p>Under the Democratic Government, apart from seeing the Huazhong edition of the "Xinhua Daily" and the "Jianghai Guide," I have never seen what the Shanghai newspapers look like after the victory. Letters to and from the "Liberated Area" are also subject to inspection. The personnel of the post office have now been replaced and are under the jurisdiction of the "Border Region Government."

<p>Food Shortage in Japan</p>
<p>The "New York Times" recently said that since Christmas last year, Japanese officials have taken two steps to combat the food shortage: Tokyo police have cracked down on illegal food sales, resulting in the arrest of 423 people.</p>
<p>Recently, the Allied Headquarters refused to remove certain items from food ration cards, intending to continue controlling these foods, but it also made it clear that this did not mean that current prices should remain at their original level. This indirectly shows that the government intends to raise prices, and the government may use subsidies to prevent consumer unrest.</p>
<p>At the same time, Major Lyonard, chief of the Agriculture and Forestry Division of the National Resources Group of the Allied Headquarters, also announced that the rice production in the US military occupation area of ​​Korea last year (rice production accounts for 71 percent of all Korea) was 81.8 million bushels. It is estimated that Korea's demand for the year is 70.2 million bushels. This does not include the possible needs of North Korea. The Soviet side did not allow the rice production figures in the north to be revealed.</p>
<p>Due to the Soviet side's lack of expression on trade between the north and south, and the US's policy of controlling Japan's foreign trade, farmers in southern Korea are holding unstable feelings about the future. Therefore, the possibility of 10 million bushels of rice flowing into the export market is extremely small.</p>
<p>Strangely, Japanese police do not prohibit black market food sales, but they prevent the sale of non-rationed foods, such as vegetables and fish. Two hundred and fifty vegetable vendors and 173 fish vendors have been arrested for selling their produce at prices more than twice the wholesale price. The Japanese government stipulates that retail prices should not exceed 20 percent of wholesale prices. Translated by Jin Ming</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Convenes Meeting to Revise Middle School Curriculum Standards: Reducing the Physical and Mental Burden of Middle School Students, Confirming the Unification of Junior High School Goals, Adjusting Teaching Outlines and Hours</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing by Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Education recently convened a Middle School Curriculum Discussion Meeting in Chongqing to revise the middle school curriculum standards. The concentrated opinions of the discussion have been summarized into several key points. Although they still need to be reviewed further for a final decision, the general direction can be known. We will briefly outline them here for the reference of those who care about education:</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The motive and purpose of revising the middle school curriculum is to reduce the physical and mental burden of middle school students and increase their learning efficiency.</p>
<p>Abolition</p>
<p>Abolishing the Grouping System: The middle school curriculum focuses on unification. This semester, English has already been changed to a required course in junior high school, which has broken the previous rule of dividing junior high school into Group A and Group B, one preparing for employment and the other preparing for further education. To confirm the unification of junior high school goals, the grouping system should be explicitly abolished. Senior high school will not be divided into groups, but from the second academic year, students will choose to study mathematics (analytic geometry), English, and Chinese according to their interests as additional courses.</p>
<p>Adjustment</p>
<p>The mathematics courses and hours for both senior and junior high schools will be adjusted separately. "In junior high school," the time for scout class will be reduced, and extracurricular time will be increased. The geology and mineralogy in the natural history curriculum will be changed and merged into natural geography teaching. Work will focus on practical skills. History and geography will be taught separately and centrally in principle. "In senior high school," home economics and nursing will replace work courses for girls. The mineralogy course is in preparation for cultivating geology and mineralogy talents. Music will be listed as an extracurricular activity from the second grade. History and geography will be taught separately and centrally. English will be a required course for all. Senior high school should focus on reading comprehension training, and junior high school should start with listening and speaking training, gradually entering writing training. The total weekly teaching hours for senior and junior high schools will be reduced by eliminating or reducing the repeating course hours, so the number of hours will be less than before the war.

<h3>Teachers of Private Schools in This City Petition: Satisfactory Result</h3>
<p>Municipal Council Approves Subsidy of 200 Million Yuan</p>
<p>[Report from this city] Teachers of private primary and secondary schools, in order to promote education and improve treatment, petitioned the Municipal Education Bureau through two groups, including the Primary School Joint In-Service Training Association. After making three requests, they went to the Education Bureau again yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm to request instructions. Director Zhi personally answered the three points: (1) The subsidy for private schools is 80,000 yuan per person, which will be issued at the same time as the second phase of subsidies for municipal schools. (2) Yesterday's municipal meeting approved the allocation of 200 million yuan in subsidies to private schools, but this amount is not enough to meet the standard of 80,000 yuan per person mentioned in the first point. It is approved to transfer a part of it from the Teacher Respect Movement Subsidy Fund. It is reported that the Municipal Education Bureau originally planned to give 54 million yuan in two phases in February and May, evenly distributed. The February portion has been issued as scheduled. When the May portion is issued, it will be made up to 200 million yuan. (3) A notice was issued to all schools to issue the fees collected for the second time to the teachers and staff at once, and the amount shall not be lower than 80% of the total income. Those who violate this shall be reported and severely punished. It was also announced that the relief supplies approved by the General Relief Association would include one bag of flour and five pounds of milk powder for each teacher and staff member. Finally, the current difficulties of the education cause and national finances were described, hoping that all colleagues in the education community would work together to overcome the difficulties and work hard in their positions.</p>

(2) Increase research expenses for teachers to match prices, so as to ensure the stability of life and facilitate the progress of research work.</p>

<h3>Under Strict Government Supervision, Rice Prices Rise Sharply; Flour and Miscellaneous Grains Also Increase; Market Situation is Quite Chaotic</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw producers' prices increase gradually, bolstering market confidence. Retail sales improved. Despite strict government supervision, both japonica and indica rice varieties, as well as yuan rice, uniformly rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Chaozhou flour merchants continued to acquire supplies off-market, driving prices up by around 2,000 yuan. The same was true for soybeans, which increased by over 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were also brisk, with prices jumping by 1,000 yuan. Bran also saw strong demand, surging by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts followed suit, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Edible oil retail prices continued their upward trajectory, soaring by anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The market has become chaotic, with prices rising across the board. The future is difficult to predict. According to rice market sources, yesterday's city arrivals included six types of rice, totaling over 5,000 dan. The types and quantities are as follows: White japonica 1,791 dan, Du indica 627 dan, Yangqiu 437 dan, Early rice 1,180 dan, Thin rice 1,079 dan, White yuan 146 dan.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Refined gold futures opened flat yesterday morning, but struggled to maintain that level, falling below 1.56 million. The US dollar recovered from a weak opening, stimulating the gold market. Prices briefly rebounded slightly, reaching 1.585 million. However, buyers were constrained by the Central Bank's controlled price, and buying interest soon waned. At noon, prices hovered around 1.57 million. The afternoon remained stable, with the final price slightly lower than the previous day's close, decreasing by ten thousand. Jewelry gold sold for 168,000, silver remained unchanged, and silver dollars also remained the same. Black market discounts ranged from 12% to 16%.</p>
<h3>Continuous Settlements Boost the US Dollar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, supply and demand for the US dollar were somewhat volatile. Although physical currency was being released, retail demand had not yet subsided. Some foreign firms, anticipating a further surge in imports next month, were cautiously buying on dips. The dollar recovered from an initial weakness, opening at 2,310 yuan and soon falling to below 2,270 yuan. Continuous settlements depleted reserves, and the dollar briefly rose again to over 2,330 yuan. At noon, the dollar hovered around 2,310 yuan. The afternoon market was expected to remain volatile. The final price was slightly lower than the previous day's close. Hong Kong dollars fluctuated with the exchange rate, ending with old banknotes up 5 yuan and new banknotes up 8 yuan. Rupees were at 520 yuan and Hong Kong telegraphic transfers at 420 yuan, both showing slight gains. Official US dollar exchange rates remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Increased Sales by Peers Ease Yarn Market Surge</h3>
<p>The surge in the yarn market subsided yesterday. The continued rise of middle and smaller yarn dealers for several days prompted peers to sell their holdings. Additionally, Shuangma yarn's attempt to increase prices lacked strength, leading to a decrease of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan for various brands of 20-count yarn. Market confidence remained stable. It was reported that off-market trading increased again in the afternoon. At noon, the Spinning and Weaving Company, as usual, announced a bidding range, with 10-count to 42-count yarn priced 20,000 to 50,000 yuan higher than the previous period. The remaining prices were similar. Additionally, there were ten types of yarn, ranging from two to fifty-one lots each, which were still sold through a bidding process. It was reported that seven of these lots were won by yarn firms such as Juncheng, Hongda, and Changtong Taichang. The bidding prices were comparable to the market prices.</p>
<h3>Progress in Spot Cotton Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton telecommunications showed the market to be strong in the near term and weak in the long term. The near-term price was US$27.85, and the long-term price was US$28.00. Mid-term spot prices were not announced. Spot cotton trading progressed in the local market, with private enterprises such as Shenxin No. 16 Factory being the main buyers. Intra-industry trading was also brisk. The delivery price to the factory for mid-term cotton has risen to 88,000 yuan, an increase of 7,000 to 8,000 yuan in recent days. The Spinning and Weaving Company was not heard to be purchasing.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Declines Further</h3>
<p>Late spring and early summer are typically the peak season for tea sales as new harvests arrive. However, recent transactions have been steadily declining, with prices falling without rebound. This is due to poor absorption by local tea shops, sluggish purchasing by out-of-town buyers, and continued inactivity from foreign firms. As a result, some owners have experienced cash flow problems and have collectively resorted to selling their goods. The market is now facing oversupply, and restoring market confidence is proving difficult. The outlook suggests a continuation of the current downward trend.</p>
<h3>Surge in Coking Coal Arrivals Causes White Coal to Plunge</h3>
<p>Coking coal is essential for steelmaking and can also be used for cooking fuel. With the city facing a fuel shortage, local merchants planned to purchase large quantities of coking coal from Tianjin, Bengbu, and Xuzhou to prepare for sales at high prices. However, transportation disruptions prevented timely shipments. Only recently have arrivals increased. With increased coal deliveries in Shanghai, sales of coking coal have been significantly affected. Current stockpiles exceed 10,000 tons, with Jingxing coking coal being the most abundant, followed by Kaiping coal, and Zhongxing coal being the least. The recent decline in white coal prices is primarily due to the abundance of coking coal arrivals.</p>
<p>The Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been shipping large quantities of Kailuan coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai, totaling several thousand tons. In addition, the freighter "Haijia" has arrived with 6,000 tons of coal, and the "Pivo," carrying 10,000 tons of Keelung coal from Taiwan, is docked at Huangpu Wharf, unloading its cargo. Furthermore, large shipments of coal are expected to arrive from Vietnam shortly. Shanghai's coal needs will not be lacking.</p>
<h3>Peppermint Oil: High Demand in the US</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 26th] Buyers this month are showing little interest in Chinese cinnamon and anise oil due to expectations of further price declines. However, peppermint oil is in high demand due to limited supply. The menthol market is reportedly quiet.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla-Style Performance: Government Bonds Reach New Highs; Stock Market Waits for Turnaround</h3>
<p>Government bonds continue their mysterious path, trading under police scrutiny. Buyers are pushing forward. Despite one bank on Sijing Road unloading over one million, individual investors and large bond market players are able to absorb the supply. B-type bonds opened low but closed high, creating a lively performance and reaching a new high of 6,900 yuan. Buying sentiment remains strong, with prices surging by 850 yuan. Other bonds also increased by 650 to 1,000 yuan. Most large stock traders have ceased trading, while some have relocated. Activity is limited due to the lack of transparency, resulting in a quiet and sparse market. Stock prices experienced small fluctuations. Traders are awaiting the outcome of negotiations and remain cautious. However, rumors of improved conditions next week have shifted sentiment. Afternoon trading saw increased bids, and off-market trading of foreign stocks became slightly more active, with strong buying interest. In anticipation of a return to normalcy, prices rebounded slightly from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>Yesterday, artificial silk prices rose due to strong demand from northern buyers. 120-count Huoqiao brand opened at 1.5 million yuan, steadily rising to close at 1.59 million yuan. Afternoon prices increased further, reaching 1.62 million yuan, an increase of 110,000 yuan from the previous day. 120-count miscellaneous brands of semi-gloss silk saw limited demand, resulting in a small decrease of 20,000 yuan. There were no transactions for high-quality, evenness factory silk. Both high-quality and ordinary silk increased by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Yesterday, ordinary high-quality silk was priced at 1.7 million yuan, an increase of approximately 100,000 yuan from the previous two days. Fabric prices also increased, with Meiya quilt covers trading at 1.17 million yuan in the morning. Dachen checkered crepe continues to advance, with each yard priced at 4,140 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan from the previous day. Second-date tickets were being sold at 180 yuan. Sheng and Hangzhou goods also reported price increases.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Fluctuate Greatly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar prices experienced significant fluctuations, with a focus on medium-grade white sugar. The guild initially set the price at 63,000 yuan in the morning, then increased it to 65,000-66,000 yuan before retracting to 63,000 yuan. Afternoon trading remained tight, rising again to 65,000-66,000 yuan. No sellers were available even at 66,000 yuan. Several dozen bags of low-grade Qing sugar were offered at 51,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Arrival of Taiwanese Sugar Expected to Lower Prices</h3>
<p>According to sources in the sugar industry, the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal's sugar inventory, which had been entrusted to the guild for fair and wholesale sales since December of last year, has been completely sold. This was effective in suppressing sugar prices at the end of the lunar year. Subsequently, 4,000 metric tons of sugar shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai were also entrusted to the guild for wholesale sales, with prices consistently around 50,000 yuan. Compared to the sharp price increases of other commodities in recent months, sugar prices have remained relatively stable. Recent price increases are attributed to increased demand exceeding supply due to improved transportation and increased purchasing by customers from various regions. Destinations for these sugar sales, transported by sea, range from Xi'an to Lanzhou, and, transported by the Yangtze River, from Shanghai to Yichang. Therefore, current price increases are considered a temporary trend. It is now reported that 3,000 metric tons of Taiwanese sugar will arrive in Shanghai soon. This sugar will be supplied to the market and is expected to lower sugar prices.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Caustic soda prices increased slightly compared to the previous day because arriving shipments had not yet been unloaded and there was some retail purchasing activity. Yesterday, a foreign merchant received a telegram from Manila stating that exports from that location were definitely prohibited, and remaining inventories were dwindling, with the current price at over US$140 per barrel, excluding shipping costs.</p>
<h3>Objections to Tea Loan Allocation</h3>
<p>Tea industry loans totaling 700,000 yuan have been approved by the authorities. Of this amount, 220,000 yuan is allocated to the Pingshui district and is being handled by the China Farmers Bank. The bank has sent letters to the guarantors, requiring them to complete detailed forms and sign agreements within three days. However, tea merchants generally disagree with the allocated loan amounts. It is reported that they will request the authorities to reconsider the matter.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Loan</h3>
<p>Totaling 400 Million Yuan to Purchase 50 Buses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Utility Bureau, to develop municipal transportation, previously established a preparatory office for the Shanghai Public Bus Company, beginning to restore old lines and procure new vehicles. It repaired and refurbished the already received older vehicles, totaling 50 buses, to serve the city divided across three routes. However, reliance on only dozens of these dilapidated vehicles has proved insufficient to meet demand. The bureau has requested a loan of 400 million yuan from the Joint Savings Society, planning to purchase 50 new vehicles. The bureau has notified the British Shanghai Electric Construction Company to restore all existing lines by the end of June of this year. Otherwise, the contract previously made with the Shanghai Municipal Council will be voided.</p>
<h3>Prices on Bandit Islands</h3>
<p>Five and a Half Times Higher Than Before the War</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 25th] According to government statistics, the cost of living in the Philippines gradually decreased after liberation, but has been rising again since the beginning of March. The main reason is the shortage of rice, with prices rising by 25% between March 6th and April 2nd. As of the 10th of this month, the cost of living index was 548% higher than before the war.</p>
<h3>North China Securities Exchange Ordered to Close; Must Be Liquidated Before Further Arrangements</h3>
<p>The Tianjin North China Securities Exchange was ordered by the municipal government to close on the 22nd of this month. The exchange was the only speculative market in Tianjin, established during the enemy occupation period. It was initiated by the Chambers of Commerce, Banks, and Money Houses of Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan. It officially opened on August 27, 1945. The exchange's operations involved brokers trading with each other within the exchange. The listed securities totaled 26, but daily trading was mainly focused on Qixin, Luan Mining, East Asia, Jian, and Jiangnan, with only a few miscellaneous stocks. On November 3 of last year, Zhang Guowei, the Special Finance and Economic Commissioner of the Finance Ministry residing in the Jilu Chahar District, appointed Liu Jingyuan as the receiving commissioner. Because the exchange was one of Tianjin's important financial institutions, all operations were permitted to continue as usual in the interest of stabilizing the market, until now. The current closure and liquidation is being supervised by the Bureau of Social Affairs in accordance with the Finance Ministry's regulations on the liquidation of commercial and financial institutions in recovered areas. Whether the exchange can reopen in the future will depend on the Finance Ministry's review and decision after the liquidation. After the exchange closed, the Securities Dealers Association held a meeting to discuss countermeasures, but no specific decision was made.</p>
<h3>Commercial Summary</h3>
<p>Longan: Buyers actively stocked up, tightening the market and driving up prices. Yesterday, over 600 baskets of large-bubble Longan were offered at 60,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Northern Goods: Negotiation between sales and buyers has not settled; transaction is deficient. Black melon seeds from Huaizhongzhuang were sold for 71,200 yuan.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Qianmen and British American Tobacco experienced oversupply, driving prices down. Lao Dao and Xiannv benefited from a lack of Shanghai-produced cigarettes, leading Chinese merchants' brands to gain favor and prices to increase.</p>
<p>Western Medicine: Bottled quinine was priced at the Great Wan Customs, and canned quinine was priced around 50,000. With steady deliveries of raw materials for western medicine, locally produced products have generally softened in price.</p>
<p>Paper Rolls: There are reports of large imports of American paper rolls on the Great Lai Shipping Company's Wawali Da ship in early next month, leading to concerns about potential price declines.</p>
<p>Hardware: 5- and 6-cent iron nails and pipes experienced sluggish sales and slight price decreases. Lacquer and purple copper pipes saw manufacturer demand, leading to a slight price increase. Three-Star saw blades also increased slightly; the remainder remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Leather: Raw cattle and sheep hides have recently seen some imports from outer ports, resulting in softer prices. Yellow cowhide has also declined slightly, while the remainder remained stable.</p>
<p>Bristles: Market conditions remained quiet. It is reported that the price of the 17th type was only US$2.50 per pound in foreign markets. If domestic prices are based on this foreign market price, it will be difficult for domestic prices to improve.</p>
<h3>US Radio Production to Break Records This Year</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] According to the Federal Communications Commission: US radio production in 1946 is estimated to reach a record high of 21 million units, over 7 million units more than the record production volume in 1941. According to manufacturers' plans, approximately 1.8 million of these 21 million radios will be AM radios.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Chinese Medicine Arrives in the US; Export Tax Considered Too High</h3>
<p>The first batch of over 100 packages of Chinese medicine sent by air by Chongqing Zhongning Company has arrived in the United States. According to the company's San Francisco telegram, the local overseas Chinese and allied friends are quite interested and hope that our country will ship large quantities. The company will strive for the Chinese medicine market in the United States, and will establish a large-scale pharmaceutical factory in Chongqing, specializing in the production of various Chinese medicines, packaged in boxes, and shipped to the United States. However, the current export tax is too high, and there are many transportation difficulties, making it difficult to promote export trade.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>The second phase of grain loans will be considered after the first phase of purchased rice arrives in Shanghai, but there is no intention to stop them. In the future, the scope of loans can be broadened to include more than the original seventeen lenders. The amount of loans will be determined based on actual needs.</p>
<p>It is reported that in order to develop its business and facilitate capital turnover, the China Textile Company has borrowed one million US dollars from the Bank of America.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Clearing House has approved the application of the Shanghai branch of Bazhou Bank to be included as an agent bank for clearing.</p>
<p>According to securities industry sources, there are more than 400 firms in Shanghai, employing over 80,000 people, all of whom are currently suspended and unemployed. Representatives will be sent to petition Finance Minister Yu, requesting permission to resume trading securities and stocks to make a living before the "Stock Exchange" officially reopens.</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the China National Industry Association has received participation from over 200 organizations since it began soliciting members. The deadline has been set for the 15th of next month, and a founding general assembly is planned for the end of May.</p>

<h3>The Publication Plan for the Complete Works of Shakespeare</h3>
<p>— Cao Weifeng</p>
<p>Mr. Cao Weifeng's publication plan for the Complete Works of Shakespeare can be said to be a bold attempt by the Chinese publishing industry after the victory. Seeing the distortion and depression of today's publishing industry, we are very willing to see the success of this meaningful work. – Editor</p>
<p>After much consideration, I have finally decided to allow the first ten volumes of the Complete Works of Shakespeare to meet the readers of Shanghai.</p>
<p>I made this decision for several reasons:</p>
<p>(1) I have been working on this for fifteen years, starting in the spring of the September 18th Incident. During this long and difficult—truly difficult—time, I have always been working on this alone, in silence. Although there was sympathy, there was not much encouragement, but I suffered enough ridicule and indifference. According to my own intention, I wanted to make it perfect before printing it, but this could not be done; because life is rarely stable, reference books—those who study literature know that it is impossible to do this without reference books—those that I had have been lost, and there is no way to buy those that I don't have. If I could improve my life in the foreseeable future and concentrate on this work, then I would not be in a hurry to publish this part first, but this is hopeless. Therefore, I originally hoped to write a more detailed preface for each volume, add more annotations, add a few more illustrations, and improve and correct some of the problems that I knew existed, but none of these could be done. I can only let them meet the readers naked. Because if I don't publish it at this time, I may have to wait another ten or eight years, and the situation will still not improve.</p>
<p>(2) When I was in the interior, Wentong Bookstore in Guiyang published ten volumes. This is a good bookstore, and the owner's intentions were very good. I also have special reasons to miss it—the time I lived on Huajia Mountain outside Guiyang City that year is particularly worth remembering—but due to the ability of the workers and proofreaders, all ten volumes were riddled with errors. I am willing to revise my own manuscripts five or ten times—Hamlet alone has been revised more than five times—but I dare not look at the printed ones at all. Recently, in order to have them printed in Shanghai, I took them out to read, and some places were so wrong that I blushed with shame. This made me even more determined to rush to typeset them, and I also decided to be the final proofreader myself.</p>
<p>(3) It seems that we have not had this kind of publication for a long time. The so-called Shanghai style in the past is now even more "Shanghai"; the so-called Beijing style in the past, no publisher dares to try. Most of the published books are thin volumes, and even if there is a good book, it is not easy to sell three or five thousand copies; the life of a publishing house is sometimes shorter than the life of sales. Therefore, most of the time when a new book is published, it is with the determination to lose money, although because of interest, many people are willing to lose money regardless—these people are most worthy of our respect. The Chinese cultural and publishing circles should not always be so weak and delicate, with demons rampant.</p>
<p>The Complete Works of Shakespeare should have a total of forty volumes, and the first ten volumes are now being printed; the second ten volumes should be available soon, as for the third and fourth ten volumes, I am afraid it will still take a while.</p>
<p>This attempt is probably the first such attempt in the Chinese publishing industry after the victory. This matter is bound to fail commercially, but if broad sympathy can assist it, it may succeed. In that case, our publishing industry may embark on a new path.</p>
<h3>Introducing Books on Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>— Lin Gu</p>
<p>Edited by Pan Gongzhan, published by Zhengzhong Bookstore</p>
<p>The basic spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution does not lie in inheriting the old rules and systems of representative politics, but especially in transforming and innovating the old rules and systems of representative politics. The ultimate goal of the Kuomintang's fifty years of effort is to establish the democratic constitutionalism of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals and return political power to the people. As for the steps and guidelines for its implementation, they are fully reflected in the Founding Program personally formulated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The Founding Program starts with removing obstacles and aims at completing construction, the so-called three periods of military government, tutelage, and constitutionalism. This is the procedure for China to implement a democratic political system. Indeed, due to the remaining poison of the imperial system for thousands of years, most people lack both political awareness and experience. It is inevitable that if they are suddenly given political power, it will be seized by the powerful. When Dr. Sun Yat-sen was alive, recalling the past, he often attributed the rampant poison of military閥劫持 to the fact that party members in the early years of the Republic of China did not follow the tutelage procedures, so he held the firmest view of the revolutionary strategy he had set. The historical mission of the Kuomintang lies in establishing the Republic of China, but its central task is to be responsible for tutelage in order to train the people to have sufficient ability and practical experience to effectively apply ordinary administrative civil rights, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes of past constitutional failures.</p>
<p>After the Kuomintang completed the military government period and established the tutelage system, it began to prepare for the implementation of constitutionalism. The so-called May 5th Draft Constitution took three years and seven drafts to complete. The May 5th Draft Constitution is an unofficial draft that must be discussed and decided by the National Assembly to become a true constitution. The National Assembly was repeatedly planned to be convened before the war and during the War of Resistance, but in fact the difficulty of convening the assembly could not be overcome by wishes alone. Recently, it was originally scheduled to be convened on May 5th, but due to factual difficulties, the government has temporarily postponed it again.</p>
<p>The National Assembly is the key to ending tutelage and starting constitutionalism. The political power exercised by the Kuomintang in accordance with the law of the tutelage period formulated by the National Assembly must be transferred to the National Assembly in accordance with the constitution promulgated by the National Assembly. The government has the greatest sincerity to convene the National Assembly and return political power to the people, and the people have the eager expectation to convene the National Assembly and implement constitutionalism. The so-called return of political power to the people must be entrusted through the institution of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Now, the National Assembly is about to be convened, and its task is to formulate the fundamental law of the constitutional period. In recent years, there have been many books discussing this issue, but the one that can truly expound the principles and systems of democratic politics of the Three Principles of the People is the Constitutionalism Series edited by Pan Gongzhan and published by Zhengzhong Bookstore. The Constitutionalism Series is a set of twelve volumes, written by those who have been engaged in drafting the May 5th Draft Constitution or who have specialized in constitutional studies. Each volume has been personally proofread by Mr. Pan. These twelve books have discussed all aspects of constitutionalism. The titles of the books are as follows: Chen Changheng: The Essence of the Five-Power Constitution Draft, Hu Jingming: The Five-Power Constitution and the Constitutions of Various Countries, Zhang Yuanruo: The Rights and Obligations of the People, Cui Shuqin: Populist Politics and Parliamentary Politics, Yang Youjiong: Division of Powers and Equalization of Powers System, Li Zonghuang: Constitutionalism and Local Autonomy, Yang Dongwen: Constitutionalism and National Defense, Wu Qiyuan: Constitutionalism and Economy, Cheng Tianfang: Constitution and Education, Chen Nianzhong: County-Level People's Opinion Organs, Wang Guanqing: A Brief History of the Chinese Constitutional Movement, Pan Gongzhan: Common Words on Constitutionalism. The first ten volumes have already been published in Chongqing, and only a part has been printed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding books on constitutionalism, the bureau also has the Legislative Yuan's Explanation of the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China, Liu Jingwen's Principles of Chinese Constitutionalism, and other books, the content of which is also very valuable.</p>
<h3>The Neglected Book Famine</h3>
<p>— Li Sheng</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai publishing industry has felt a resurgence after the victory of the War of Resistance, it has not yet recovered to the level of readers' needs. Loyal readers still feel depressed!</p>
<p>For example, books and magazines on medicine related to human life are really scarce. It is difficult to find one or two in each newspaper, and even those that have published one or two issues in the past have mostly disappeared without a sound. Also, comprehensive and meaningful monthly magazines are becoming less and less!</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the so-called "small weekly magazines" are numerous and becoming more and more popular. Their content is mostly worthless and corrupts morals, and their harm is no less than that of comic books for elementary school students! They are only suitable for those with rudimentary knowledge.</p>
<p>Academic medical books and magazines are decreasing day by day, and many students in schools do not have textbooks to attend classes. This is not a glorious thing from the perspective of the entire publishing industry, society, and country.</p>
<p>The root cause is nothing more than expensive paper and expensive labor and materials. Academic books and magazines are not easy to make money, while small weekly magazines are easy to handle and do not lead to losses. But this is a short-sighted view! Meaningful books, newspapers, and magazines, although they cannot be popular for a while, are like deeply rooted trees that will not fall suddenly. As long as they are well cultivated, why worry that the number of readers will not increase day by day? And small weekly magazines and speculative publications, even if the authorities do not ban them, will be rejected by readers because they are all the same "colorless" stories.</p>
<p>I hope that the publishing industry will automatically correct the book famine and seek happiness for itself and others, and not run counter to national policy. Because the publishing industry is different from other businesses, it is a mediator between the foreknowledge and afterknowledge.</p>
<h3>Words from Writers</h3>
<p>— Liang Gong</p>
<p>A great writer is one who writes about the anxieties of the times and creates the light of the times. – Lu Xun</p>
<p>The reason why a writer and poet falls behind is that he has broken away from the struggle. – Kosarev</p>
<p>A writer should be as unencumbered by worldly affairs as a clergyman. – Emerson</p>
<p>The clumsiness of a writer is the mouthpiece of the soul. – Cervantes</p>
<p>My articles are not on the surface, but in the soul. Only a lofty soul can have great thoughts... A great and respectable writer is not one who uses writing as a means of earning a living. People who only seek to make money naturally have base thoughts. – Rousseau</p>
<h3>"Small Weekly Magazines and Social Atmosphere"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cai</p>
<p>Mr. Li Sheng's article "Small Weekly Magazines and Social Atmosphere," published in the Shenbao publishing section on April 6, discussed the fact that the current small weekly magazines in this city are harmful to morals and should be banned. It is a truly insightful and gratifying argument.</p>
<p>In the present moment, after eight years of bloody resistance and victory, with national reconstruction waiting to be carried out, we dare not say how important the responsibilities of the general publishing industry are, or what kind of responsibilities they should bear. However, publications that are closely related to culture and education can directly affect the minds and bodies of young people and indirectly shift the social atmosphere. Their significance for the future of the country and the nation is no less than that of school education. The serious and proper attitude that the general publishing industry should take in the great era at the beginning of national reconstruction is self-evident. We will not discuss the motives of the editors and publishers of these small publications, but the negative and serious consequences of their influence, such as poisoning the minds of young people, leading them astray, and the resulting deterioration of social atmosphere and order, are undeniable facts. And those who like to read these low-taste publications are mostly middle school youths and general vocational youths such as shop assistants, craftsmen, and laborers. The former are the backbone of future society, and the future of the country and the nation depends on them. The latter are the grassroots workers who make up a considerable number in the city, and their impact on social order is very large.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Sheng's article said that due to the "Stroblemann" case, the sales of Parisian tabloids reached as many as 500,000 copies, and its influence caused the number of crimes in Belgium and Italy to increase as a result. Although this example cannot be completely determined as a consequence caused by news reports, deliberately promoting and exaggerating certain improper news, such as obscenity and theft, is not only unhelpful to young people and society, but also invisibly gives young people a very bad hint and leads them astray.</p>
<p>I remember that someone once criticized old-style comic books as inappropriate reading material for the masses, precisely because their content either had a negative, decadent, and depraved attitude towards life, or violated patriotic ideas, or encouraged obscenity and theft. However, there are still many excellent and proper stories, such as love for the country and loyalty to the emperor, respect for teachers and filial piety, and some of them are not necessarily worse than the currently popular small publications in Shanghai. Since those old-style folk publications are on the list of bans, these harmful and useless small publications should be banned even more in the current time of material hardship and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>As a result of the eight-year War of Resistance, the social order in the recovered areas is chaotic and people are uneasy. Under the high pressure of the enemy and puppets in Shanghai, the people's mental suffering and life suppression urgently need the revelation and leadership of a proper and healthy life ideology and attitude, and the encouragement and guidance of a spirit that leads to active national reconstruction, so that this important metropolis of China can exert its due strength under the leadership of the government. The responsibility of this spiritual food that leads the thoughts and spirit of the Shanghai people and inspires the wisdom and strength of the Shanghai people is conceivable. For the sake of Shanghai's future, and even more for the sake of the Shanghai people's future, I hope that the authorities will thoroughly ban those publications that encourage obscenity and theft and promote positive and active spiritual education for the people.</p>
<h3>Writers' Enlightenment</h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>A writer is able to gain our love and concern because he reveals his soul to us. – Tolstoy</p>
<p>A work is built on the author's deepest sincerity. If you use your work to deceive people, then the first person to be deceived is the author himself. – Gorky</p>
<p>It took me many years of effort, hard work, and research to use a simple method. Now I can tell my friends—those who are holding pens: the highest art is "sweat"! To write a clean and beautiful sentence, you must concentrate your power intensely and then radiate it from the tip of your pen. – Duncan</p>
<p>Everything I create is, to me, like a poet has something sprouting in the depths of his heart, so there is the sparkle of flame, the burning of life. – Ibsen</p>
<p>My poems may not be enough to explain me, but I am the explanation of the poems. – Shelley</p>
<p>Anyone who explores the depths of their own heart and faithfully writes down what they see will gain a great many readers. – Hervé</p>
<p>What is written, as long as it originates from a pure heart, even if it is ugly, is still a seed of life! – Davis</p>
<p>Of all writing, I only love writing with blood. – Nietzsche</p>
