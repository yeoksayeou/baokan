<h3>馬司兩使努力不懈尋求解決現局途徑　昨分晤宋周今接見吳張</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕和平商談十二日續有接觸，馬特使十二日上午九時三刻訪司徒大使，對於連日與周恩來晤談情形及癥結，作一小時半之研討，兩氏並仍其信心，決爲此和平重大任務繼續努力。下午一時許，司使即以電話邀周恩來於四時至使館晤談，周氏如的而至，談至五時三刻辭出。聞所談內容，周氏認爲國內戰事日益擴大，目前實有獲得停戰保證與在行動上立即停戰之必要。至兩週前馬。司所建議之非正式五人小組會議一事，目前巳無實現可能。某權威人士並稱：此事亦與過去若干不能解決而遭擱置之事件相同，雖五人小組會議實際係一可以解決問題之臨時組織，然亦不得不歸入「緩辦」之「檔案」，此語意味深長。司徒大使旋於六時三刻離館訪馬特使，記者於其行前作兩分鐘之訪問，大使精神甚佳，記者苜詢以目前局勢是否有新發展，答「我想是有希望的」，再詢以現在是否擬在五人小組會議之外，另覓一新的途徑，答「我現在尙不能說」。最後詢以現在是否先就軍事方面求得解決，然後再談政治，答「我必須再與馬特使晤談後再說」。言下含笑點首，謂我和馬特使會見后，或會有一種辦法的，旋即乘車赴寗海路，半小時後，即返館宴客。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕據司徒大使私人顧問傳涇波稱：日來消息較爲沉寂，然余信越兩三日必有發展，有大的新聞，記者詢以是否蔣主席返京之大新聞，傳答，蔣主席返京，自是一大新聞，餘若干事亦可因主席之返京而有發展。（尙有吳文官長鼎曰在滬發表對大局之談話，請閱第二版）</p>
<p>〔聯合肚華盛頓十一日電〕華盛頓屋報專　作家白朗今日撰文稱：馬歇爾特使最近向美政府呈報斡旋中國和平情形，謂已到達盡頭。中國政府軍與莫斯科援助之中共軍間武裝衝突，時益見緊張，大局暫時難望有何決定，中國益將成爲民主與共產思想之鬥爭塲所。杜魯門總統或者即將抉擇是否繼續支持中國正式政府，抑或向反對派屈服，撒回對國民政府一切援助，而聽由蘇聯盡力支持延安。</p>
<p>周恩來建議</p>
<p>恢復三人小組會談</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕馬歇爾特使與周恩來之晤談，事後據共產黨代表團發言人稱：周氏認爲非正式五人小組會議因不能解決問題，故無召開必要，目前重要者，端在停戰，故建議召開軍事三人小組會議，以謀解決，此項建議將由馬特使轉致政府代表，如獲同意，則軍事三人小組會議又將揭幕。十二日晚七時半，馬特使曾赴宋院長公館長談，衆信與此事有關。又馬特使可能於十三日八上廬山，於迎接夫人外，並就詢主席之意見。政府代表吳鐵城·張厲生兩氏，亦將於十三日再訪司徒大使，就此頻繁之接觸，復顯示目前局勢有一新轉變。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕報載合衆社南京十一日電稱：「共產然發言人王炳南談：蔣主席已拒絕下停戰令之保證，且提出共產黨所不能接受之反提案，該反提案及拒絕書，巳於十二日馬。周會談中，由馬特使面交周恩來」。關於此事，記者頃訪有關方面，據稱：並無此事，蔣主席亦無任何文件轉交周氏，共產黨代表團發言人范長江亦稱：並無文件交與周氏。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十二日電〕中共在華北戰塲失利，提議立即重行召開軍事三人小組會議，以圖迅速促成全面停戰。中共今日之行動，顯係從原來要求無條件停戰，退讓一步，似已願意由三人小組謀取和平方法，可能附有條件。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕傳延安方面已準備憲法草案，據稱將以「解放區人民代表大會」提出，此項憲法草案，九月初已在京滬一帶出現。有關方面相信延安目前尙在運用其所謂「代表大會」之憲草，爲政治神經戰之用。</p>
<h3>國軍續收復遵化　冀東共軍集平谷馬蘭峪　冀南淸鄕工作順利展開</h3>

<p>〔本報北平十二日電〕保定電話，冀中冀南之淸鄕工作，順利展開中，保定南方國軍，收復田各莊，現在李八莊一帶與共軍激戰中，國軍共已收復二十八個村鎭，共軍正向蠡縣，博野退却，地方共軍爲阻止並牽制國軍前進，昨晚十一時自東方調來三個團，及二千餘民兵，猛攻保定西南四十里之大魏村，激戰七小時，保定東方國軍十日晚收復高陽保定問之要道劉家口後，分兵一路向安新推進，已在該縣境之垞上與共軍遭遇，高陽城內共軍正作撤退準備，向津浦綫搬運物資。現沿平漢綫之都縣新樂正定唐縣完縣定興，均順利展開淸鄕工作，冀南元氏國軍，亦收復西北方十五據點。石家莊鐵路局已準備工料，隨國軍南進搶修鐵路。</p>

<h3>中共所謂組府實係政治把戲　美廣播家一語道破</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十一日電〕無綫電評論家台維斯昨日在美國廣播公司播稱：「中國共產黨以另立「自治政府」恫嚇中國政府，此種恐嚇，並不被人重視，蓋此種恐嚇爲中國政治把戲之又一行動，在中國之政治把戲中，往往戰爭與宣傳雙管齊下，」台維斯稱：「實際上，中共在華北各處早已有一政府，此種政府事實上已屬自治性質，但在本年一月間中共尙同意：一俟聯合政府成立后，即將其自治政府置於新政府控制之下。一部份人對於此種轉變所引爲憂慮者，爲此種自治政府有設立在蘇聯邊界之滿洲北部之說，果爾，則此種自治政府暫時名義上爲獨立國家如外蒙古或保加利亞，而至時機成熟時，即將併入蘇維埃聯邦共和國。</p>
<h3>侵擾康平共軍已向通遼潰竄</h3>
<p>〔中央社　陽十二日電〕由通遼，遼源向康平侵擾共軍，經國軍反擊後，已向原路潰竄。</p>
<h3>蘇北收復各地區　人民獲眞正解放</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕頃據蘇北來客談：國軍推進區域，人民精神上獲得最大解放者有二點：（一）糧食可以做主，（二）不要開會，因在中共侵佔區內，老百姓要向軍隊討糧吃，不是軍隊向老百姓討糧吃，同時不問婦女兒童，每天都要開會，眞是寃無處伸，有苦說不出，故一旦壓力解除，大家均慶幸不置。</p>

<p>〔中央社牯嶺十二日電〕三民主義靑年團第二次全國代表大會宣言如次：</p>
<p>本團自民國二十七年三月九日，誕生於辛亥革命首義之武昌，嗣於三十二年三月二十九日黃花崗先烈紀念，召集第一次全國代表大會於戰時首都的重慶，茲復於本年九月一日，召集第二次全國代表大會於決定杭戰國策聖地的廬山。回溯自誕生到現在，歷時已經八年，在這八年富中，我們的國家，我們的民族，眞是處於生死存亡的關頭，本團同志藉着三民主義偉大的感召，和我們國長英明的領導，很光榮的都已參加神聖的抗戰的工作，經過長期艱苦的奮鬥，終於獲得最後的勝利了，我們本以捍衛國家，復興民族，實現三民主義爲職志，團員人數，於此抗戰中增加到百四十餘萬之衆，使本團今日已成爲吾國歷史上最偉大的靑年團體，這使我們愈加深信努力之絕非徒然，中華民國之前途，也必得由我們的繼續努力而達到平等自由富强康樂的目的，我們並未虛生於此偉大的時代，我們必當完成此偉大時代所賦予之使命。茲當本次大會閉幕之日，願將我們的意見，對我們全國的同胞，對我們全國的靑年，作坦白的陳述（一）首先要爲我全國靑年指出的，我們中國國民革命，今天已進入了到達最終成功以前，最黑暗困難的一個時期，國家的統一，受到了破壞的威脅，民族的命運，瀕於陷弱的危機，但是我們對革命的信心，應愈礪愈堅，對建國的努力，必再接再厲，我們深信有國父的三民主義作我們的指針，將在此黑階之中益顯出前途的光明。我們深信有我們團長領導着我們，爲國民革命而努力奮鬥，一定能够保障國家的統一，完成建國的使命，所以我們對於革命前途，是絕對樂觀，而建國成功，亦絕無疑問。我們今日所悲憤而痛心的，乃是國家在此存亡危急的時機，而社會漫無是非，人心轉趨頹散，甚至邪正倒置，順逆不分，民族固有的道德，掃地無餘，國民應有的責任，置之度外，這都是足以陷國家民族於危亂淪亡，斷不是復興建國時期所應有，我們靑年生在這個動盪震撼的時期，必須認淸目標，明辨順逆，端正趨向，抱定決心，爲國家作中流的砥柱，爲民族挽旣倒的狂瀾，以盡我們這一輩對國家對民族應有的責任。國家的興亡治亂，革命成敗榮辱，與我們靑年的關係最切，而我們靑年所負的責任亦最大，我們萬不能隨人俯仰，與俗浮沈，萬不能袖手旁觀，荒棄天職，否則，中華民族世世子孫，將淪爲異族的奴隸，而我們今國靑年，亦就成爲千古的罪人。爲了明瞭我們的責任和使命，我們對於今日國際和國內情勞，應該作一番鄭重的檢討。（未完明日續）</p>

<h3>吳文官長談大局　政府切盼實現五人會談　張羣赴美純係治療毒瘤</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕國民政府文官長吳鼎昌氏九日下午由牯乘機過京飛抵滬，記者昨特趨旅邸叩謁，詢對五人小組會談作何觀測，吳氏稱：五人小組係由馬歇爾特使提出，明白說明僅商談國民政府改組問題，並未附帶任何先決條件，蓋政府改組後，其他各項問題，自然容易解決，政府因此表示贊同，最近中共提出之兩條件，在馬歇爾特使七上廬山前，政府尙未聞悉，政府目前唯一期望，即五人會談早日實現，並獲得圓滿成功，至於停戰間題，當由三人小組繼續商談。吳氏縱稱：政府對實施政協決　，早具誠意，蔣主席在八一四文吿中巳有說明，改組政府，僅爲實施政協決議案中之一部份，記者詢以關於恢復交通商談，是否已有成議？吳氏答稱：六月三十日雙方對全面恢復交通及中共退出東北地區，已成立協議，惟因中共堅持其他條件，故未簽字。吳氏認爲大局決不致長久拖延，和平終有實現之望。</p>
<p>關於川雀主席張岳軍之赴美，確係就醫。蓋在兩年前，集耳後即生一顆粒形小塊，因公務繁忙，迄未割治，最近始因董秉奇醫師之勸，施行手術，經過情形良好，刀口逐漸平復，惟割下之物，經董醫師騐後，認爲係一毒瘤，必須以深度愛克司光從速檢査病根，否則難免形成大患，而我國僅有此種儀器兩部，一在上海聖心醫院，早經廢置，一在北平協和醫院，經電査明，亦不堪用，遂決定赴美醫治。斯項消息，初由中央社記者向董醫師處探悉，傳至首都，嗣由吳秘書長鐵城電吿本人，當即轉陳主席，其初尙不以爲眞，迨至本月七日，張氏有電到牯，向主席請假三月，始經證實，主席因渠病旣較重，遂批准給假，並即派鄧錫侯將軍代理川省主席職務，以成其行，八日得馬歇爾特使通知，已爲渠設法在十日開出之軍用飛機中，留得機位，可即啓行，本人常即轉知張氏，趕速於九日設法來滬，本人適亦於九日下山，當時主席曾囑帶一信與張氏，本人遂即由牯來滬，主席致張氏信中僅寥寥數語，盼望渠身體恢復健康後，立即返國，至外界種種傳說，絕非事實。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>施政方針貴在實行！</h3>
<p>國防最高委員曾前天在京舉行例會，通過民國三十六年度政府施政方針，其中最重要的有三項：（一）實行憲政，推行民主政冶；（二）整編軍隊，務使軍隊國家化；（三）農地改革，繁榮農村，改善農民生活。</p>
<p>上述三項方針，雖是老生常談，耳熟能詳，並沒有新穎的因素在內，但是觀察一下國內的政情，一般人民所希望於政府的，以及目下中國政治所亟待興革的，也不外乎這三個原則。爲政不在多言，只要政府能够脚踏實地，誠心做去，力求其實現，不再視作口頭禪，那末中國政治的前途，也就可以展開光明的遠景了。</p>
<p>第一，我國推行民主政治。不僅爲適應世界潮流，可以不負友邦人士對我們的期望，而且全國上下，也莫不認爲中國政治的出路，唯有迅速民主化一途。因爲目前政治的積弊，首在行政缺少效率，冗員加多而業務退步，議論紛紜而成功少見。其次，則爲貪汚之風積重難返，而懲辦貪汚往往虎頭蛇尾，雷聲大而雨點小。怎樣增進行政的效率？如何養成廉潔的政風？只有民主政治的誠意實行，才是對症的良藥。因爲上述的二種樻弊都是官僚政治的敗症，惟有讓人民直接參加政治，纔可社絕濫用私人的頽風，描除欺瞞舞弊的痼疾，民主政治，須自下而上，故最重要的應儘量普設各省市縣的地方民意機關，切實監督政府。至實行憲政，首先要有一部憲法，作爲全國上下信守奉行的規範，所以憲法草案問題，尤應早日解決，而負有制憲任務的國民大會，政府旣定於十一月十二日舉行，就不應再度延期。</p>
<p>第二，軍隊國家化，爲保障國家的統一與和平計，固然亟待此項原則之實施，即爲國家復興的前途計，也應早日促其實現。在任何一個民主國家內，決沒有擁有軍隊的政黨，更沒有以武力作爲政爭的工具的；否則內戰就不能避免。目下中國所以有割據稱雄的共黨邊區政府者，就是因爲共黨自有軍隊，迷信武力，覺得有恃無恐，便可爲所欲爲。所以軍隊國家化一天不能實現，則國內和平就一天沒有保障。同時，中國經過八年的艱苦抗戰，物質的犧牲與損失，幾乎不能用數字來統計，戰後痛定思痛，尤當從速整編軍隊，减少國家的開支，集中我們的人力物力，用之於建國復興的偉業。</p>
<p>第三，說到　榮農村。中國人民百分之八十是農民，在這次抗戰期間，他們曾以廣大的人力物力，支持政府的抗戰國策，貢獻最大。但是在農業生產的技術上，墨守成法，故步自封，生產量不僅未見增加，反而逐漸减少，再加以天災人禍，使整個的農村社會已達於破產的邊緣，因此誰也不能否認，建國復興的重點，首在繁榮農村，改善一般貧苦農民的生活，其具體辦法，除與美國合作改進生產技術而外，還須顧及農村社會的環境，不僅政治要淸明，秩序要安定，捐稅要减輕，而且還要趕快計劇實現國父遺敎，推行農地改革政策，使一般耕農，均能自有其地，安居樂業。</p>
<p>要之，政府的施政方針是不錯的，而且也並不陳義太高、可是最成爲問題的，政府是否已下了大決心去實現它自己所定的方針。</p>
<p>中英間的友誼與商務</p>
<p>英國親善商業訪問代表團，由團長波埃斯爵士率領，已自倫敦啓程來華。中國駐英大使鄭天錫，曾在英倫設宴餞行，並在席問演說，表示中國人民對於英國工商界，期望甚殷，對於代表團前往中國，尤表歡迎，並謂中國市塲前途無量，中英兩國人民百年來之互相信任及親善，決非以金錢所能計算。波埃斯團長亦在席間致答詞稱，代表團之目的，乃在促進兩國友及商業關係。計程英國代表團將於本月杪行抵中國，中英兩國邦交的新頁，即將展開，兩國貿易亦可望大量增進。同時英國大使施諦文爵士，亦於日前自京來滬，初次與上海各界人士見面，即表示英國願在科學·技術，及工業上，協助中國建設復興，可見施諦文大使關切中國之熱忱。</p>
<p>中英兩國的邦交，素稱密切，允其經過這一次的大戰，變成了患難之交；兩國的友誼，經過血的洗煉，應該益形鞏固。尤其在戰後，工黨繼保守黨之後而組閣秉政，不論對內對外，莫不採取開明政策。在今日的英國，不論朝野，都在盼望中國能成爲强大統一的民主國家。施諦文大使奉命來華之前，即已表示：「英國在華，除商業而外，別無其他任何野心。英國政府當在最大可能範圍以內，盡力協助中國，務使中國成爲張大而統一的國家。」英國之所希望於中國者如此，中國之所期望英國協助者，也不過如此。雙方的意見旣能相同，互相諒解，也就更較容易。所以中英兩國邦交的前途，實有無限的希望。</p>
<p>英國代表團所有代表，都是英國工商界的鉅子，而英國又是一個注重工商業的現代國家，所以他們的言行，不僅可以代表英國工商界，而且也可以代表其政府。我們希望英國代表團來華之後，實地調査及硏究，擬就具體方案，提供英國政府參考，以決定其對華貿易政策，俾能早日以資本及技術來協助中國建設復興，使中英雙方均蒙其益。</p>
<p>淸查與捐稅</p>
<p>昨天本報已的略論到市參議會今後的動向應該怎樣了。今天的市參議會據報又將討論是否參加淸査團工作問題。昨天各組審査會中最受人注目的，則無過於下半年度的市預算案，和市政府交議的五個關於捐稅的提案。大勢看來，此時一般市民所最關心的，也不外乎兩點：（一）參議會旣代表市民，而年來市民所最感不滿的就是「接收」工作，參議會究竟願不願，也是敢不敢當仁不讓，負起淸査的責任？（二）市政府除了捐親而外，旣無其他的交議案，參議會是不是就只替市民充代表畫諾加稅</p>
<p>我們現在姑且粗枝大葉的略述我們對於這兩個問題的管見</p>
<p>第一，接收工作如果有毛病，出毛病的責任是在接收機關，而接收機關是政府人員，故由民意機關來一次淸査，於理並無不當，而且毋寗說是應該的。聞張知本團長已表示上海淸査工作繁重，歡迎市參議會可以多推二三人參加，而且淸查時間也還可酌量延長，在我們看來，市參議會似乎不能再深閉固拒。假使認爲參加數人還不够，市參議會儘可同時另組織調査委員會，（參議會條例本有得設各種委員會的規定，）專門從事調査上海市範圍內一年來所有接收工作的任務，以爲中央淸査團的後盾。固然，我們未必能期望有了市參議會的調查，就可査得一淸二白，全無遺誤，但參議員至少自稱來自民間，倘能認眞察訪，總有若干裨益。如其諷爲工作不易做好，就落得推開不管，未免說不過去。</p>
<p>第二，鄭重其事的召集了一次市參議會，市政府交議五案却只爲的是捐稅，（一）爲房捐，秋季照夏季加一倍二倍至四倍，冬季並按秋季各加一倍；（二）市政捐，亦按房屋現値，自千分之二至千分之三，分等征收；（三）淸潔捐，亦按房捐辦法，分等征收；（四）公用事業附征市政捐，各按每月水電煤氣電話等繳費數額附征百分之十；（五）恢復賽馬，征收捐稅。前四項預計本年內須增收四百五十億元。聞市政府下半年度預算支出總額爲八百餘億元，可見半數要靠這些新增的捐稅來彌補。我們要先問市參議會幾點：（一）在這次會議裏，諸君究竟要市政府辦些什麼市政？（二）諸君除了討論捐稅以外，還打算議些什麽大事？（三）市政府要增收這些捐稅，有沒有先報吿諸君將修補幾條馬路幾條橋樑？淸除幾噸垃圾？增埋幾個溝管？多辦幾級學校？多設幾個警察和淸道夫？換言之，有沒有先開具並且說明了工作計劃？（四）房捐的意義本來就是市政捐，並不是房屋租賃所得稅，如今房捐以外，再來一個市政捐，淸潔捐，公用事業附征市政捐等等，實在令人有「巧立名目」之感。市政府反正不過要籌款，爽直「一條鞭」，簡單一些要收多少就得了，何必如此捐稅重重，令人不快？否則淸潔要捐，敎育將來豈不又要捐？公用要捐，工務將來豈不又要捐？警察……豈不更要捐？總之，市民要希望辦好市政，常然不能不納捐，不能不納充分的捐，市參議員原是納稅人的代表，討論納稅也是責無旁貸的，但無論如何，我們先須知道納稅的用途，次須要求捐稅的簡單而不涉於苛繁！</p>

<p>〔聯合社成功湖十一日電〕聯合國安理會本日開會時，蘇代表葛羅米柯與英代表賈德幹，又因「侮辱紅軍」問題，一度發生口角，最後休會至十三日再開。葛羅米柯堅決反對撤銷烏克蘭對英希之控訴案，賈德幹加以反駁，謂烏克蘭公然指英軍干涉希臘，假令余指紅軍有同樣罪行，則烏蘇兩國代表又將作何感想。葛氏當指此語偽侮辱紅軍，賈氏乃將　詞重讀一遍，證明無可撤回。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕蘇聯請安理會調查聯合國會員現有多少軍隊駐在其大國領土之外，美國擬質問此舉用意何在。蘇聯之聲請適用於前敵國以外之一切領土，因此依照蘇聯計劃，蘇軍駐在匈牙利與羅馬尼亞者可不必提出報告。預料此全部問題，不久將在安理會中提出。美官場認為蘇聯提議，係欲使美國因駐軍冰島等處，及英國因駐軍希臘而陷於窘境。</p>
<h3>對和會斯拉夫集團　美突作雙重反攻　聲明放棄對義賠償要求　度張解除保國南陲武裝</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十一日電〕斯拉夫集團在和會攻擊義大利希臘為地中海之屏障，美國今日突然作雙重反攻，請和會至少解除保加利亞在希臘邊界之武裝，并注意美國對義大利之援助，勿令其以此作為他國之賠償。此項聲明係由美駐法大使哲弗生，及國務院經濟專家索伯，分別在對保和約政治領土委會及對義和約經濟委會中發表。索氏宣布美國對於義大利願取消其在地中海兩次血戰中所受直接損失約二百億元之任何賠償要求，總計美國直接支出之戰費，不下三千五百五十億元，等於美國戰前全部國富，惟美政府并不欲其他國家一律取消其賠償要求云。印度，加拿大，澳洲，南非等國，同時亦已放棄對義賠償要求。</p>
<h3>我國代表持論公正　昔日之敵明日之友　索取賠償需視國力</h3>

<h3>南欲與義直接談判　解決兩國疆界問題</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十一日電〕南斯拉夫似欲與義大利直接談判，以解決特港問題，并決定義南國界。南國探知義大利是否願意在特港設立兩國共管式之政權，使該區不受聯合國機構之直轄管理。南國則將保證使阜姆及戈里齊亞兩地義大利居民，可獲若干自治權，波拉區將歸義大利所有。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十一日電〕希臘國王喬治二世返國前夕，在此間發表公告，說明其維護大國權利之決意。略謂，「國際糾紛已使希臘捲入巨大之爭執漩渦。希臘之統一，不僅成為政治與經濟福利問題，且為自保的問題。希臘之和平繫於是，推而廣之，世界之和平亦繋於是。國家之統一，乃以希臘文明與基督敎文明之根本原則為基礎，此種文明自古以來，即常保護希臘，今後自當再度解除吾國敵人之武裝，準許吾等確保每一方面之獨立。吾國國策之獨立性，不能徒以言語得之，僅可由吾人政治生命之安定得之。余當為此種主張，竭盡全力，以報效國民」。希五流亡倫敦五年於茲，此乃希臘公民投票後初次公開宣言。</p>

<h3>龐大國營事成菌訣　美國的草根制度（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員毛樹清寄</p>
<p>草根制度的第二個特色，是儘量求發展。</p>
<p>無限制發展。現在TVA的機構，較一九三三年時代已經增大了十多倍，他們的意思，希望更能擴充，像亂草的根一樣，攀伸到泥土的深底。但雖然各自攀伸，草的本身，生命祇是一個，因此他們聯繋之中有分工，分工之中也有聯繋。用中國的官衙名字來翻譯，現在田納西河谷水利管理局，有三處，九科，八室，兩署。高高在上的有董事會，董事會以下有總經理，總經理之下設三大處：電力處，水利處，農地處。電力處底下設三科：工程建築科，電力管理科，電力使用科。水利處底下也設三科：設計科，建築科，水流控制科。農地處之下也設三科：農作科，森林科，化學工程科。此外，直屬於總經理的，有八室兩署：人事室，地方情形調查，財產供應室，地方情形調查室，醫務室，商務室，儲藏保管室。兩署是預算署，情報署。情報署包括圖書資料，電影攝影，以及其他的招待出版事宜。像這樣一個國營事業</p>
<p>龐大的機構像這樣一個國營事業，分工容易，聯繋卻難。在「草根制度」實施以前，分層負責制沒有實行，那時候，還沒有總經理。故羅斯福總統祇　任命了一個三人委員會，（即後來的董事會）權責異常不明。董事會中群龍無首，三個人的專長和見識都不相同。例如：董事之一的毛根，他是田納兩大學的校長，學昆蟲學出身，他的著眼點祇知農業，不知其他。李令肅學法律出身，他的著眼點祇在於制度，組織，及社會反嚮。因之彼此弄得首尾不掉，進展非常緩慢。TAA成立五年後，到一九三八年，羅斯福才決定實行董事長集權制度；但成效仍然有限。毛根在一九三八年任董事長，已經七十一歲了。像這樣大的一個企業，要一個七十一歲的老頭子全權担當，势所不能，所以後来才改行总经理制度。一直到李令肃就任董事长，TAA的整個「草根制度」確立以後，才走入了行政系統的正軌。這裏，我該介紹一下TVA的。</p>
<p>前後三董事他們的出身，及事業。第一個我應該提到李令肅。這一位青年事業家，如今是田納西水利局的中流砥柱，他現在是TVA成立的時候，羅斯福派他出任董事，那時他才三十三歲。他是伊利諾安人，年青時在印第安州讀書，他在哈佛大學念法律，到一九二三年才畢業。李令肅沒有漂亮的履歷，要說有，那便是他對TVA的貢獻。自從羅斯福把惹大使命受給他以後，這位年青幹才在田納西，真是沒命的幹。他在一九四四年出版的「邁進中的民主政治」那本書中說：「TVA沒有權力，也從不要權力去強迫農民做工，強迫商人，地主，做任何工作。如果說：今天大家認為TVA得到了相當的成功，那麼，這成功應該歸功於人民自動的力量，歸功於民主政治的志願，熱忱，與合作。」李令肅是懂得怎樣激發人民的熱忱的一個，也是能善於運用人民熱忱的一個。世界大戰</p>
<p>勝利結束後，李令肅受國務院之聘，出任原子能的顧問，但他的興趣，仍在TVA。我在田納西，沒有看到他；但在會客室裏，看到中國資源委員會，送給李令肅的一幅中國畫。第二個要介紹的是前任董事長，即現任董事毛根先生。他是加拿昂泰羅人，昴泰羅是有名的水力發電所在。（TVA之父瑙雷斯，就在昂泰羅獲得不少心得。）他在昂泰羅大學畢業後，遷移到美國南方路易西安那州，在州立大學研究園藝學和昆蟲學，并且正式請求加入了美國車籍。因為他的農學造詣深厚，遂逐漸在美國農學界上，建立聲望，一九〇五年，毛根離路易西安那赴田納西，在田納西州立大學任教，一九一三年，毛根升任農學院院長，一九一九年，任田納西大學校長。毛根現在已經七十九歲，頭髪早已禿頂了。他在第一次歐戰時，兼管過田納西全省的糧食。他的行政經驗以公正剛直見長，在學術界，他現在是美國農學泰斗。他在一九三八年，當地TVA的董事長，但因為精力不繼於一九四一年辭職，專任董事。</p>
<p>第三名董事是樸潑樸潑一九三九年，才出任田納西水利局的董事，他是路易西安那州人，今年六十二歲，年青時候以運動著稱，是路易西安那的足球選手。他在芝加哥大學學法律，後來到愛達華州任律師，州法官，最後於一九三三年當選國會上議員。一九三九年被羅斯福選　任為田納西水利局的董事。三位董事沒有一個田納西人，這是民主國家的一個特色。現在TVA的全部大小職員中，田納西本地人不及一半。打破地域觀念，大膽的任用年青人做事，是「草根制度」以外兩個成功的因素。（完）</p>

<h3>市參議會審查提案　昨分十組進行　討論側重財政　推翻增加房捐</h3>
<p>徵收市政捐初步決議　賽馬問題待下次討論</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕此次市參議會審査提案及施政報吿共分審査委員會十組，昨日上下午分別在三處舉行，第一次及第二次審査會。除第一組在蒲柏路第五區公所，第四組在市商會外，其他八紙均在娩園舉行。第六第七兩組設陽合上，座位排列，有成一字形者，有成U字形者。各組審査委員會討論各有不同，有討論提案者，有僅討論工作報吿者，有研究單行法規者，但大多因審査會尙有二次，且提案未全部印就，審査時間有限，故初步議決或通過之案件均不多。</p>
<p>各組審査會中，以第三組審査財政及地政之提案及施政報吿者，討論最爲熱一烈，並對市長交議案五件，（即（一）增加房捐，（二）舉辦市政捐，（三）徵收淸潔捐，（四）公用事業附繳市政捐，及（五）恢復賽馬）均有重要之初步決議。財政局長谷春帆特於上下午列席報吿及解釋該案。吳市長亦於下午親臨會塲對各項問題，有所說明。</p>
<p>谷局長表示，市府下半年度預算，不數達三百三十餘億元，增加稅收，似屬迫不得已。對於各案均有詳細解釋，允對增加房捐，說明優點數點：（一）房捐係直接稅，不能轉加於他人，且不易發生流弊。（二）如增收營業稅或筵席稅等，容易刺激物價，故不如增加房捐。（三）稅收穩定，而且確實。現時估價方法，係由專家三十餘人，費時二年餘，始吿完成，故極爲準確，並可利用舊工部局時代房屋租賃還原計算，並依建築公司折舊方法，减低現實。又按實際調査市政捐應比房捐爲低，如照交議案增加房捐，市府於半年內，的可有一百八十億收入，開征市政捐，半年內的可增加一百五十億收入，淸潔捐半年內約有八十四億元，公用事業附征市政捐，半年內約有四十億〇二百萬元，賽馬約有二十四億元。</p>
<p>後經各參議員紛紛討論，贊成舉辦市政捐或增加房捐者各有不同意見，但經決議，淸潔捐決不予徵收，分市政捐及房捐兩項作決定。結果以五對四票，初步議決徵收市政捐，而不增加房捐，但下午該組對於上項二捐，仍有異議。吳市長並解釋市政捐，若按房捐辦法，徵收較易，否則困難較多，而實際房租已不止加一百四十倍而爲四百九十倍，生活指數中居住一項，即按此而定。</p>
<p>該組召集人趙棣華，以此案甚爲重要，上午並有若干議員未出席，經通過再付表決，結果仍以七對六票，初步議決徵收市政捐，其辦法則尙未確定。</p>
<h3>市府下半年度預算　編製如空中樓閣　計劃未送到前認為無從審查　審核決算擬閉幕後另行辦理</h3>
<p>第九組審核市預決算，除出席該組議負外，尙有市府會計主任閔湘帆列席報吿，並有財局副局長胡文元曁各局會計主任參加。但經報吿後，各議員均認爲市府所編製三十五年下半年度預算近於「空中棋閣」，預算理應根據各項工作計劃而定，今倒行逆施，先定預算後定計劃，有所不當。而各局工作計劃並未制定，致無從審査。對於事業與營業機關費亦應有詳細報吿。經決議：（一）各局書面工作計劃請於十七日前送到。（二）根據總預算中所提營業機關及事業機關費，亦請於十七日前詳細報吿。（三）審核決算，因限於時間，建議於大會閉幕後，設置常設委員會辦理之。（四）定十五日上午召開全體審查會，討論預算問題（有待大會通過）。十五日下午則加開小組會一次。</p>
<p>下午三時，第九組爲鄭重商討預算及財政收支問題，加入第三組合併討論。由第九組召集人徐永祚代表向市長提出意見數點：（一）預算書中所列臨時門項內生活補助費四百四十六億五千餘萬元再加其他佔臨時門總數十分之七八，可見市府對於「養人」之支出浩大，很値得注意。若以節流而言，用人實在太多，不知少用幾個行不行？（二）收入方面：過去英法工部局及市政府三機構之大宗收入，旣建立於房捐地捐上面，收入甚大，則現在所不明瞭者，閘北南市等地何以不收房捐？如要再等一年半載調査估價後再收，豈非損失重大？如調查不易，亦可暫時按舊案辦理。徐參議員並建議如要設法增加收入，可吾在公用事業上着想增加或再發行公債等。</p>
<p>市長當即表示，對徐參議員所提各點佩服異常，但附帶聲明市府並非不預備緊縮，目前之生活補助費若依二十五年度比較，僅佔總預算之三百分之一、實爲最低之行政費，而本市警力不够，尙須增加甚多，以市府本身再裁减（前已裁百餘人）一二百人，於整個支出，並無大影響，而實際上，確已裁至最低限度。至於事業與行政費根本不易劃分，在外國預算無此分別。例如警察或工程包工費，究係行政費抑係事業費？同時政治未上軌道，實大有影響於市政，市府對於整個稅收，僅要求至最低限度。本人須向各位吿罪者，此次預算編製，確屬不能滿意。對於各項工作計劃，決予說明籌劃，但希望各位　　我以硬性的規定。王乃　　提出營業收入項內上海市市銀行收入八千餘億元，實際決不止此數，請加說明。吳市長對此點解釋稱：市銀行僅爲代理市庫而已，其業務全係按照省市銀行而辦，存入中央銀行，不如其他商業銀行能發展謀利。</p>
<p>第九組後又單獨舉行會議，請公用，工務，敎育三局會計主任，口頭報吿簡括之預算及支出項目。</p>
<h3>審查單行規章</h3>
<p>第十組審査關於單行規章及法律之提案，昨日上下午該組討論並通過提案僅二則，即馬君碩等提出之「擬請勵行提審法，以重人權而維法紀案」，及「擬請司法機關迅速審訊並判決奸逆案」，其他均爲審査法規，已由各議員分別負責審査各項規章。</p>
<p>該組收到市府交與審査法規共一百四十種，由各議員於昨日初步審査一部分，今日起即將個別詳細審査。昨日審査之各項規章，計有：（一）房屋租賃管理規則，（二）房屋糾紛處分辦法，（三）房屋租金標準，（四）房捐征收暫行規則，（五）土地權狀辦法，（六）勞資爭議處理辦法，（七）烟毒調騐規則，（八）違反舞一塲登記辦法，（九）私建棚屋辦法，（十）臨時搭蓋棚屋辦法等多項。尙有市府新議草案如管理碼頭辦法，及開闢道路辦法等，均待當局確立後審査之。</p>
<p>審査會對於各項規章均將嚴格審核，如有於法律上無根據或與法律相抵觸，限制人民權利，而增加義務者，均需提呈行政院備案。</p>
<h3>跑馬跑不跑　舌戰一塲未得要領　市長解釋決不奉承外國人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨天下午逸園內的第三組審査會，好比是一個小戰塲。跟着財政稅收以七對六票初步議決徵收市政捐後，就提到了這個難以解決的「跑馬」問題。第三組是在六點鐘最後散會的。這個足以使全上海中外人士關懷的一個案了，吸引了四五十個在塲的人包圍着旁聽，連逸園的十幾個茶房，也睜大了好奇的眼睛，釘着每個發言人，希望尋求一個結論。雖然到散會爲止，跑馬廳的命運依舊沒有決定，可是那一塲激烈塲面，也就此造成了它昨天在各組審査會中最精彩的一幕。</p>
<p>市長在聽取民意之前，先站起來作了一番解釋。懷着滿腔誠意，同時也帶點聲明的意思，他說：「我根本不想奉承外國人，我想把跑馬廳塲地五百畝都買下來作爲集合塲所，參議會會塲，上海這末一個大都市，每次開什麼大會，都要借美琪戲院或大光明戲院等等，這怎麼說得過去」。接着他又說計劃把地買來後在一邊造一個大會塲，第一層爲大禮堂，第二層爲參議會會塲，其他小間作爲審査會辦公室。購地的辦法，打算以「羊毛出在羊身上」的算盤，開放跑馬，將收入作發行公債的基金，二年之後，整個地皮都可歸市府，這樣一來，不但會塲能解決，還可以開闢馬路，便利交通。如果不准他們賽馬，他們要請求建築，則按照法令市政府沒法不答應的。這樣，造好了房子，以後再要收回可就難了。</p>
<p>接着市長談話後，第一個發言的是駱淸華，他說：跑馬在任何國際大都市內都有，對於這問題，我們也不必看得太嚴重，也不用太顧到道德觀念而反對。我們希望市長能盡最大努力，不一定要在二年之後，如果能在一年前後設法收回那更理想。但不贊成在跑馬廳舉行，別的都撇開不談，有一點需要顧到的，就是交通問題，南京中路在目前已擁擠不堪，再加上每週跑馬兩次，那簡直可以斷絕交通了。陳公達則堅　表示絕對反對，覺得跑馬具有賭博性，允其在勝利以後，我們再開倒車，實在不應該。張一渠也反對跑馬。旣然不贊成了，可是總得想出個辦法來。賈德超意思不妨按舊價把地買下來。虞舜主張拿江灣或引翔港的地來交換。市長再解釋：這是一個事實問題，這地如果拿來作市民投資購買，則還可抵押，但拿來作公共塲所，無人投資，銀行亦不願辦理。說到照舊定地價購買。在土地法上亦不能通過。再說把郊外土地交換給他們，人家又是否同意？跑馬改在郊外，他們在市區跑馬廳內依舊想建屋，那更爲麻煩。</p>
<p>最後，時間又到了，再討論也不能有結論，王維　就提議把這案子保留在下次審査會再鄭重硏究。並認爲這問題太大，還得交大會討論。結果就如此通過。</p>

<p>旋審査陳公達等所提消弭工潮問題一案，唐參議員世昌稱，應社會局先行供給有關資料，再予討論。是時社會局代表潘更生稱：工人生活費用，現已採取以生活指數爲標準，秉此原則，加以評斷。金參議員鴻翔稱：政府應制定法規，規定：（一）凡聚衆包圍者，不予調解；（二）調解時勞資出席人數應能平均；（三）調解人員不得派有色彩者參加；（四）工廠關閉，任何方面不得加以干涉。包參議員文新主張應規定底薪標準·唐世昌以爲：（一）勞資雙方，均應遵守法令；（二）應促成勞資間開誠合作；（三）應發展民族工業。董參議員仁貴以爲：此事勞資雙方，俱應克盡責任。資方應：（一）安定勞工生活；（二）舉辦勞工福利；（三）實行工廠會議。勞方應：（一）提高工作效率；（二）遵守勞工紀律。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕關於本市公園問題，昨日參議會中亦有熱烈之討論，參議員徐則驤。田淑君。王乃徐等提出應利用公有空地添闢公園，並一律免費。但參議員中有認爲在房荒嚴重之今日，利用空地爲平民造屋第一，公園其次。亦有人認爲目前公園秩序紊亂之原因，須歸咎於門票過低（現僅收二十元），故欲整頓公園，首須提高門票至一千元，然多數認爲公園爲市民大多數之公園，不應取費，故討論再三，經審査意見結果，物色適當公地，增闢公園，允其位於四郊方面者，並須加强公園之管理。</p>

<h3>淸查團張團長表示極盼市參議員參加　潘議長今日再提大會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會對於是否推選代表參加接牧工作淸査團，曾有兩次討論，尙未決定。前日第五次大會曾決議保留，俟淸査團張團長知本由杭回滬接洽後，再付討論。前晚張團長已自杭回滬。本報記者昨曾從有關各方探悉，張團長在杭閱及上海各報記載此事，故特先趕回上海，昨日下午六時，即與市參議會潘議長及項秘書長晤談。首先說明該團工作因杭州部份方開始淸査，故已呈請中央酌予延長時間，並謂照章得聘請當地省市參議會參議員二人爲委員參加工作，因範圍包括滬杭，故分請滬市及浙省兩參議會各推派一人，浙省業已指定，極盼滬市民意機關亦能有人共同參加。次又解釋以前認爲臨參會業已結束，正式參議會尙未開議，故未函邀，此或不免引起誤會，實則此次中央特組淸査團，無非要澈底淸査，整肅官方，故當地民意機關如能多推二人參加，雖與編制稍有不符，亦無不表示歡迎云云。潘議長當允於今日（十三）第七次大會中再行提出報吿，續付討論，期能使當地民意機關與中央監察機關，相互配合，對淸査接收工作，有所貢獻。</p>
<p>杭州工作簡單　定海須往査察</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕團長又對記者稱：杭州市政之整齊，殊可讚揚，並謂浙江省之接收工作比較簡單，淸査亦自容易，且經事前充分佈置，故工作進行十分順利。唯定海方面當時接收時海軍曾與警察發生衝突，軍風紀似太壞，決由張慶楨吳望伋兩委員前往實地査察，以明眞相，並追究責任。淸査團抵杭第二天，曾巡視倉庫三座，大致情形均屬良好，預計杭州方面一星期工作可以竣事。至該團自七月二十四日開始辦公迄今，恰已滿五十天之期，據該團秘書處統計在上海方面共收到密吿三百零九件，皆經處理，已結束者約百分之七十，雖經辦理而尙未結束者約百分三十，該團在滬收到文件共四百八十九件，發文二百四十八件，及各接收機關之報吿一百十一件，來往公文共計八百五十八件。該團因鑑於上海市淸査工作特別繁複，故已徵得淸査團聯合辦事處同意，延期至本月底結束，在今後之半月中，上海方面工作將注重結束未了案件，唯有案情重大密吿，仍擬受理云。</p>
<h3>程監使此行觀感　淸查團組織遲了</h3>
<p>〔又訊〕程監察使中行，因淸査團事去杭，昨夜由杭返滬，談此行觀感稱：「杭州的接收，總括一句話，看了傷心，杭州現在許多接收機關，多半沒有原始淸册，問他們爲什麽沒有，說他們接收的時候，最初接收的人，就根本沒有交出原始淸册，我們所看的倉庫，多半是廢銅爛鐵，爲了那許多廢銅爛鐵，也佔了許多房子，派了許多人看管，淸査團日內正接受各種密吿，淸査團組織太遲了。淸査團現在到各地去，能吾發生作用，只有靠民意來做後盾了。我們到杭州，發現某戰區長官部在全浙人民心目中，他們的「去思」，怕要經過數十百年不能磨滅，浙江父老現在談起車站上堆積裝運的紅木傢具，與衛生設備，至今尙有嗟嘆的餘音，最可傷心的，至今尙有多少民居，旣非敵，亦非僞，尙在被佔領中。」</p>
<h3>關於敎育文化</h3>
<p>第六組審査關於敎育文化之提案及施政報吿等，該組收到提案頗多，昨日僅先將已印就之提案分成數大類歸併，如國民敎育，中等敎育，學費及學校經費問題等，共計四十餘件，尙未正式審査討論。</p>
<h3>蔣遷黻到署辦公</h3>
<p>最近此間盛傳行總署長蔣廷黻氏，有辭職說，加以蔣氏自出席行總工作檢討會議歸來後，即以政躬違和，人病院調養，蔣氏請辭之說，益囂塵上。昨晨蔣氏已病愈出院，並即到署辦公，對外間傳說，加以否認，並稱：「現在尙談不到此問題」。</p>

<p>阿根廷駐華大使館代辦富南台，昨日正式被任爲駐滬總領事。富氏現年三十六歲，曾任阿根廷衛生學院敎授，此係初次出任外交官。</p>
<h3>航建協會分會積極徵求會員</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空建設協會，係以喚起民衆對航空之興趣爲目的，由蔣主席兼任總會長，最近上海市分會亦已成立，由吳市長任分會會長，並發起微求會員運動，茲錄該分會徵求團體永久會員啓事如下：「立國現代，苟不建設航空，充實空防，譬猶築室沙上，一過災害，其崩立待，此次大戰中，證例實多，可不贅言，中國有廣大領土，綿長領海，非航空無以掩護之，陸地交通困難，海上交通空虛，非航空無以補助之，各地文化不平衡，宗族間有隔閡，非航空無以溝通之，中國急需建設航空之點，誠不勝其枚舉，語云，前事不忘，後事之師，一二八閘北焦土，八一三東南沉淪，豈將士之忠勇有愧，實航空之軍力未充，我數百萬市民，痛定思痛，可不作亡羊補牢之計乎。航空建設協會之設立，其目的，在喚起民衆，對航空發生熱忱，以全民之力，協助政府，航空建設，總會設政府所在地，由主席蔣兼任總會長，滬市分會，隨國土重光而產生。自籌備以迄成立，已逾牛載，粗具規模，而國楨繼任分會長，本年工作大綱，舉其要，爲徵集會員三十萬人，參加航建工作，收集會費，於滬市建立跳傘塔，開辦飛行社，設立航空館等等，惟是事大費鉅，欲求成功，端賴各方之贊助，全市之協力，滬市全國經濟中心，人文最盛，衆擎易舉，聚沙成塔，上列設施，諸待各界賢達之共同倡導，儘先加人爲剛體永久會員，實翹望之，是爲啓。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲上海市警權統一接收週年紀念日。警察局特舉行紀念大會，地址在福州路總局底層廣塲，會塲佈置簡潔嚴肅。四時正，大會開始，官局長領導行禮如儀後，即致詞略謂：「本市警政百餘年來爲外人把持，政府警權僅及南市閘北及市郊之處，去年今日起，警權始獲統一，我人在此具有歷史性之耙念日，對過去工作應有檢討必要。我人應隨時警惕，隨時檢討：（一）我人首應團結一致，各就本位努力，本人決不願於今日再見若干身穿警察制服，行使警察職權，而背離警察崗位，甘作違法背紀之行爲。（二）上海乃國際都市，我人決不可仍以在內地時之學識經騐，從事工作，換言之，我人應於技術方而力求改進，於各方面加以努力，俾能適應國際都市之需要。最後，宣氏更强調今後當着重於實際工作，以「行」字代替「說」字，並示訓則如下：「勤以補拙，儉以養廉，公以處事，誠以待人。」至五時半散會，會後舉行聚餐大會，晚八時起，假紹興路四十七號警察俱樂部舉行遊藝大會。</p>

<h3>聞蘭亭判八年　聆判默默無一語　要求交保未獲准</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕繼袁履登處無期徒刑，林康侯處有期徒刑六年後，聞蘭亭昨晨由高院判處有期徒刑八年，至此，名聞海上之「三老」，已全部定讞。</p>
<p>昨晨九時半，提籃橋高院刑一庭內，人頭擠擠。被吿之辯護律師江庸，朱扶九，沙彥楷三律師皆到庭聆判。劉毓桂庭長偕曹駿，邱煥瀛兩推事及檢察官書記官蒞庭升座後，即命法警押上聞蘭亭，聞仍衣藍綢長衫，內襯白短衫褲，淺褐色紗襪，白底黑鞋，手持摺扇，由法警攙扶到庭。其故舊門生，皆自座起立，作鞠躬迎候狀。法醫一名，仍隨侍在側。待至被吿欄內站定後，審判長即稱：「被吿聞蘭亭之子聞椿楠具狀請求再開辯論。本院認爲證據已調査淸楚，故由合議庭裁定，申請駁回，今天本案宣判」。言舉即起立朗讀判決主文：「聞蘭亭通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處有期徒刑八年，褫奪公權八年。全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒收。」讀畢坐下，又對判決理由，稍加解釋。（詳見判決書　。旁聽者之情緒頗爲緊張，反顧被吿本人，手搖摺扇，自始至終，未發一言。審判長繼對被吿稱：「如若不服，可於接到判決書後十日內，向最高法院申請覆判」。被吿默默無言，不作表示。辯護律師繼之向庭上聲稱：「被吿年老力衰，病體日轉嚴重，請求准予交保出外醫治」。劉庭長仍言：須書面具狀，由合議庭詳議裁定。言畢諭令將被吿還押。其故舊門生又起立相送，趨前問候，直至監門而別。</p>
<h3>判決書所叙的理由</h3>
<p>被吿聞蘭亭，男，年七十七歲，武進人，住上海西愛咸斯路三七五弄三號。</p>
<p>選任辯護人江庸律師，朱扶九律師，沙彥楷律師。</p>
<p>右被吿因漢奸案件經檢察官提起公訴，本院判決如右：（主文事實從略）</p>
<p>（理由）本件被吿聞蘭亭於民國三十一年，起意投僞，加入僞上海市商曾，充任監事長，後歷任僞全國商業統制委員會監事長，理事長棉業統制委員會主任委員上海市民衆福利協會理事長各職，已據在本院</p>
<p>自認不諱</p>
<p>核與其在軍統局訊問時及本院檢察官偵查之中之供述，曁附卷自白書之記載並相符合，並有調取到案之偽商統會會議錄可資參證，事實自無疑義，所應審究者即應成立通謀敵國圖謀反抗本國之犯罪是已，査僞商統會初隸僞實業部，後改歸僞行政院直轄，係僞政府秉承敵寇意旨，推行其所謂新經濟政策，加緊統制物資之總機稱，此觀於偽商統會暫行條例第一條所定，「全國商業統制總會，以協助政府施行　策為宗旨，承實業部及其他主管部之命辦理物資統制事宜」，第四條所定「全國商業統制總會，承實業部及其他主管部之命，監督指揮所屬會員辦理，（一）關係統制物資之收買，配給事項——（五）關係軍需物資之採辦事項，（六）實集部及其他主管部指定或委託事項」等語，極爲瞭然，至僞棉業統制委員會，係僞商統會之外圍機構、爲統制棉花最高機關，其工作範圍爲華中所產棉花之收買配給，敵僞軍需及輸出棉花之供給，棉花搬運許可證之審査發給等項，此在僞申報年鑑內亦有明晰之記載，（見原書第七三三頁）被吿在此項僞組織所屬</p>
<p>經濟統制機構，擔任監事長，理事長主任委員等要職，就其任務之性質與執行之手段以觀，當然有利於敵僞，不利於木國，依照懲治漢奸條例第三條之規定應負同條例第二條第一項第一款通謀敵國岡謀反抗本國之罪責，自屬無可解免。抗辯要旨雖稱本人在滬服務五十餘年，薄負時譽，非擔任僞職，不足以資掩護，絕無通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國之居心，至在軍統局之自白書及供述，係受環境壓迫，應作無效等語，以爲免責之論據，然查被吿如果確因掩護起見，始任僞職，則於民國三十一年所服　之　上海　　　，已足以達此目的，又何以　後歷充　商統會監事長理事長，僞　會主任委員等要職，核其所爲，顯已軼出於掩　之範圍以外，與敵僞</p>
<p>沆瀣一氣</p>
<p>自非不可認定，不寗惟是，被吿於迎送敵日新舊大使席上，以主席資格發表演詞內稱：上海是經濟文化中心，地位重要，處理得當，可以貢獻戰爭力量，可以促進中日合作，盡其後方重要基地的責任，（見三十一年十一月二十五日僞新中國報）又於僞府還都五週紀念時談話內稱：「大東亞戰爭開始之後，政府基於同生共死之決　　友邦協力參戰，羣策羣力，一致奮起……使協力政府，以求最後之勝利」（見卅四年三月三日偽申報）各等語，此項報紙之記載經本院質之被吿亦不否認，是附和敵僞，業已情見乎詞，此而猶謂並無通敵叛國之故意，顯屬自欺欺人，誰能置信，至於卷附之日白書，係被吿所手寫，軍統局之訊問紀錄，後經被吿逐次簽名本屬無可爭持，况被吿於檢察官偵査中均已承認在卷，（見偵査卷本年四月十日筆錄）未聞有「應作無效」之說，乃於本案審理中突謂出於環境壓迫尤、屬未能舉出如何壓迫之交通部證，</p>
<h3>謝冠生由京抵滬　視察各司法機關　據稱周佛海西默邨等將解京受審</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）司法行政部部長謝冠生氏，偕該部首席參事陳箇民，參事倪徵　，於前晚自京來滬，作勝利後第一次之視察。昨晨十時，由本市高等法院院長郭雲觀，地方法院院長査良鑑，地檢處首席檢察官黃亮等陪同視察北浙江路高院及地院，頗多指示。十一時，在高院大禮堂召集全體人員訓話，勗勉三點：（一要新土司法人員之智識應日日新，又日新。時時求其進步，不應以現在所知，即認滿足。（二）速——社會一般人批評法院之辦案，頗多延遲，今後應盡力矯正。（三）實——辦理案件不應草率從事。匆促了事者，認自己任務已畢，然訴訟人間之糾紛，尙未了結，故應實實在在做去。最後，謝氏又示司法人員應有任勞任怨之精神。</p>
<p>今晨十時，謝部長將往西愛咸斯路高檢處，薛華立路地檢處及馬斯南路看守所視察。下午三時視察提藍橋高院，高檢處臨時辦事處及上海監獄。在滬尙有數日逗留，即將轉赴蘇州等地巡視：</p>
<p>〔又訊〕謝部長昨晨在地院辦公室接見各報記者答復各項詢問稱：（一）周佛海丁默邨等五人，不久即可由重慶解往南京公開受審。（二）關於糧貸舞弊案之管轄權問題，司法機關並未放棄職責，地檢處正在進一行偵査。（三）檢察官度之改革問題，在重慶參政會中，有人主張擴大，有人則主張撤廢，意見顯有不同，尙待愼重硏究。（四）檢舉漢奸期限問題，刑法上之犯罪時效，原有規定，現正加以研究。（五）司法人員之待遇，經行政院決定，予以提高。上海區域之法官，較同級行政人員，每月多津貼補助費五萬元，其他各地法官則多二萬五千元。（六）全國司法行政會議，如無阻碍，決於明年一月間召開。謝氏對全國各地運續接起之舞弊案頗表遺憾。惟司法機關僅可於事後懲處而無權於事先防止云。</p>
<p>言飾卸委</p>
<p>無足採信，綜査辯解各端，尙難認爲正當，惟起訴書意旨，併及於懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第四第五兩款，但關於供給敵方軍米紗布各節，旣非被吿所應尸咎，（參照袁履登唐壽民兩案本院判決）再起訴書所列關於僞上海市民衆福利協會募收防空捐部分，事關救濟空襲傷亡，亦不能證明有何不利本國或人民情事均可勿論，次査被吿在戰前服務商界，頗有聲名，早爲敵僞所矚目，滬市淪陷以年齡衰邁，未能及時遠引，其參加僞職，自因處境之困難，有以致成，較之一般甘心附逆，圖利者有間，又被吿平日置身於社會慈善事業，滬載初起，辦理傷兵醫院難民收容所，全活甚衆，此經證人黃涵之，朱夔臣到庭述明，自任僞職後，</p>
<p>擔任策反搜集情報，家中並設有秘密電台俾與後方聯絡，復有中國國民黨中央執行委員會調査統計局之公函及中委李明揚之證明書可資徵信，至於我中央地下工作人員及忠貞士庶獲其營救，或掩護者，如余祥琴，戚再玉，吳是沂，張叔通，宓季方，陳冷僧，陸惠民，張叔薇等，無慮數十人皆爭爲到庭，或具狀證明，他如折衝奔走，則大型紗廠賴以保全，延宕多方，則小型紗廠未遭取締，敲錠獻誠之阻撓，紡織人才之培養，種種事實復經虞山紡織公司沈伯琴，申新紡織第九廠吳昆生等數十家聯名呈證在卷，綜其協助抗戰有利人民之行爲、不一而足，衡以處理漢奸案件條例第三條第一項規定，確屬相符，自應依法</p>
<p>减轻本刑以昭公允，全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外併予沒收，據上論結庆依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段懲治漢奸條例第一條第三條第二條第一項第一款第八條第一項第一九條處理漢奸案件條例第三條第一項刑法第二條第一項前段第二十八條第六十四條第二項第六十五條第二項第三十七條第二項判決如主文。本案經檢察官葉于紹蒞庭執行職務。</p>

<h3>食盒配售第一天　公敎人员個個滿載而歸　下次分配府綢士林布等　許多小學敎員未曾白跑</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕昨天起，本市公敎人員物品開始配售了。記者特於昨日傍晚到配售處作了一番巡視，秩序非常良好。因爲昨天是開始的第一天，該處爲怕手續生疏，引起過分擁擠現象，所以僅通知市府所屬十六個單位先領。分發總數的五百人，除公務員外，其中也有自閘北，虹口等地趕來的小學敎員，他們因爲不知道配售的手續，所以當開始配售消息傳出的第一天，便興冲冲地老遠趕來了。配售處雖然明知他們不合手續，但是爲了不忍讓他們白跑，所以也照樣予以配售，使他們個個都滿載而歸。</p>
<p>配售的物品，計K·D食盒各九盒，均係美軍剩餘物資，K種食盒分三類——早餐午膳晚飯。早餐中包含肉丁燉蛋三·七五兩，餅乾四塊，咖啡一包，方糖四塊，水菓軟糖一方，口香糖一片，麥糊一方，香烟四支淸潔紙一束。午膳中包含乳酪四兩，餅乾八塊，巧克力軟糖一塊，水菓汁七克，車糖一·二兩，香烟四支，口香糖一片，火柴一盒。晚飯中包含燜肉四兩，餅乾四塊，牛肉汁十克，牛奶糖八塊，咖啡一包，車糖二三克，香烟四支，口香糖一片。D種食盒爲巧克力混合糖一大塊，內包含可可粉·麵粉精·糖·牛奶·澱粉·維他命B等七種營養素。每個公敎人員可得D種食物九盒，及K種食物——早·午·晚餐各三盒。</p>
<p>據物品配售處處長殷體揚對記者說：本市經登記之公敎人員共十二萬人，已發配售證者五萬人，餘在絡續分發中。第一期配售食物在本月底即可分發完畢，第二期配售物已定爲棉布，裏面包括陰丹士林，府綢，細布等，平均每四個人合得一匹布。本月二十五日起即可開始分配。還有一個好消息可以報吿本市公敎人員的，物品配售處已與物資供應局訂好長期契約，以後日用品等可源源不斷供應，因爲日用品種類很多，而各種不同的日用品未必能供本市十二萬人之分配。爲解決這種困難起見，配售處已決定在全市設立門市部數處，公開發售。公敎人員可持配給證前往任意挑選。現該處已印就淺藍色特種配給卡，上面照着千字文的排列，印着天·地，元·黃·宇·宙·洪·荒等字樣。現在「天」字卡已定配給食盒，「地」字卡將配給棉布「元」字卡就有希望買到日用品了。股處長說，以後配售物品若足供十二萬人分配的，就一律平均配售，若不足分配的各種物品，則採取個別購買制。</p>
<p>關於這一次配售的食盒，前日各報盛傳多數皆已發霉，但據股處長語記者，實非事實。美軍剩餘物資皆用蠟紙層層妥爲保護，即使時隔久遠，也不致有霉爛現象。但是也許其中有少數食盒，經長途運輸，蠟面有脫落，放在倉庫中日子久了，受週圍熱氣侵襲，則發霉現象亦非全不可能。但是這是極少數的。九盒之中未必就有一盒，並且物資供應局已答應，凡霉懷者可以照換。但據衛生局調騐結果，即使少數發霉食品，煮過後仍可食用，並且保持一切所含維他命。</p>
<p>又爲解釋配售手續，使各界明瞭該處情形起見，公敎人員物品配售處定於今日下午二時假市府大禮堂招待本市新聞界。</p>
<p>上圖為拆開之食盒內容，下圖為高積之整箱盒（本報攝）</p>
<h3>「摸竊大隊」明天解法院</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕五六百名男女老幼合組的一支「摸竊大隊」，即將於明日（十四日）在警察嚴密護送之下，向地方法地堂堂前進！</p>
<p>察局已下莫大決心，要肅淸全市扒手，　局已經發出命令，嚴令各分局切實逮捕境內所有竊犯，這次「大掃除」是從本月九日開始的，預定十四日全部集中總局。現在各局已經開始執行，新成分局已捉到八十名，總局已捉到四十餘名，其餘三十名二十名的更多，到十四日載止的時候，現在的估計是：即使這些扒手們目前已經開始「避風頭，」到了那時，總決不會在五六百名之下！</p>
<p>警察局預備把這些人都依法向地方法院送去，送去之後，情節較重的幾個，也許會被判處一兩個月徒刑。一兩個月之後，他們就刑滿釋放了。</p>
<p>釋放之後呢？</p>
<p>要找一個職業，好好重新做人罷——恐怕未必會有什麼公司商號肯收容有這種過去歷史的人。社會局主持的漕河涇救濟院和難童難民收容所是早已人滿人患了。做工去罷，當前工廠的情形實在並不興旺，如果他們能够找到以生活指數標準的工錢，他們早就不會逼上這最後一條路了。</p>
<p>他們十之八九會回到他們的「老本行。「這一個月禁閉所給他們的，也許祇是更多的「硏究」和技巧的改進：「初學」成爲「老手」胆怯的增加了勇氣。</p>
<p>總局裏新近捉到的所謂「陣上失風」的人們之中，有一個是年紀剛剛十歲的姓王的孩子。他是從蘇北流亡出來的，他的父母平在飢餓綫上搖搖欲仆，這孩干祇能靠自己去找活路。</p>
<p>他肚子餓。看見有人挑了飯走過，他走上去搶飯。不想飯還　在手裏沒有到嘴，臉上已經挨到了狠狠的一巴掌。打他的人倒並不是挑飯的夥計，而是另外一位年記大一點的「　三。」他想回手，可是又縮住了，他是打不過那個癟三的。外灘的馬路上多的是來來往往的新式汽車，他祇能呆住着，挨餓。</p>
<p>忽然有一個人向他招手。這個人也是癟三，但是却和氣地叫他過去，給他錢，叫他買一碗陽春麵吃。那個人叫這個姓王的孩子跟他走，不過有一個條件，要這孩子做他的「接靶」。</p>
<p>什麽叫「接靶」呢？這個　三是一個扒手，等他偸到東西之後，爲了避人注目，就把東西先交給這個孩子，叫他暫時保存，等到失主不注意時才交還他。</p>
<p>這個孩子很高興地答應了。他肚子餓；而且，上海的人那麽多，他又是那麽小，而要做的事又似乎是那麽容易。</p>
<p>慢慢的，他自己也動手試弒看了。有一天，他在輪船碼頭上偸一只鷄，忽然肩上落下了一隻大手，回過頭去，他看見了一個警察。</p>
<p>在警察局裏，他天眞地說，偸鷄已經不是第一次了。有的時候，剛剛偸到了手逃出來，鷄却又給別的　三搶了去。運氣好的時候，偸到的鴉風平浪靜的賣了出去，他就可以到手二三千塊錢，又可以吃幾碗陽春麵了。</p>
<p>他說，他最羨慕的是那些穿得齊齊整整上學去的小學生，他最怕的却正就是他所最習慣了的——餓！</p>

<h3>姦淫刦掠綁架勒索　殘殺民衆作惡多端　練市鎭一惡魔劉勳判處死刑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕僞浙江省保安大隊駐防吳與縣練市鎭之第三中隊補充隊長劉勳，於任內假憑惡勢在縣屬基步鄕·兪奧鄉·練市鎭·五龍鄕·里仁鄕等地，姦淫擄掠，綁架勒索，殘殺民衆，作惡多端。當地民衆，皆恨之刺骨。勝利後乃由各該鄉鄕長及三民主義靑年團等檢舉，在本市捕獲，於去年十二月十五日押進上海監獄，經高院審結，昨晨十時在刑二庭宣判，該被吿被處死刑，禠奪公權終身，全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒收。</p>
<p>劉昨短打裝束，平頂頭，赤足布鞋，兩眼陰鷙滿臉殺相，聞及判處死刑，破口即稱：「報吿老爺，我實在寃枉，他們吿我一點證據都沒有，這是天曉得」。審判長當吿以：「本院尙欲替你向最高法院申請覆判」。被告聞言，傲强答稱：「我自己來上訴」，言畢，乃由法警押回監獄。</p>
<p>按劉勳又名柳利本，四十二歲，湖南平江人，昔曾參加抗戰工作，民國卅一年四月間在吳興縣爲敵軍捕獲，査悉其前曾服務游擊隊之證件，後經僞軍第五師師長程萬軍爲其担保，卅二年獲釋後即在程部服務。其後改編被裁·乃寄居吳興練市鎭其妻沈文英之母家。嗣因偽浙江省保安大隊第三中隊長何建章率部駐防該鎭，大隊長賀勁生即任劉爲補充隊長歸何建章指揮。駐防數月，憑藉惡勢，於卅三年春在該縣基步鄕第十一保擄去副鄕長陳全茂。鄉公所職員許炎，該保保長沈元昌等數人，均以鉅款贖回，同年又在兪奧鄕組織僞巡査隊持械暴行，姦淫擄掠，綁勒索殺人。在練市鎭强姦勒索，並下鄕搶刦殺戮抗戰份子，同年六月指五龍鄕鄕民沈郁新爲我方情報員，因敲詐不遂，將其殺害，卅四年正月又帶隊洗刦該鄕第七保堪地上。道士抖。第九保流子河等處，同年九月間在里仁鄕捕捉鄕民徐福元等私押隊部，以食米求贖，並當塲擊斃該鄉鄉長沈瑞麟。前述種種惡行，被吿雖狡辯否認，但基步鄕鄕長邱苗先，練市鎭鎭長吳本立，兪奧鄕鄕長覽本英，五龍鄕鄕長鈕炳發，里仁鄕鄕長施達民等，皆分別詳陳，作證在卷。高院以其罪無可逭，乃判處死刑。</p>
<h3>四小奸各處判刑</h3>
<p>同日尙判決漢奸嫌疑犯多名，計僞保長吳炳麟與翻譯桂恒海各處有期徒刑二年六月，工頭商阿二處有期徒刑一年四月。</p>
<p>又劉兆定處有期徒刑二年六月，被吿愁眉哭臉向回庭上哀求：「老爺！可以不可以再輕一點，實在寃枉」。審判長吿以尙可申請覆判。劉始點頭隨法警還押。</p>
<h3>袁世項陳惠昌定十九日宣判</h3>
<p>同日審結老大華舞廳維納司咖啡室經理袁世項陳惠昌漢奸嫌疑案，定本月十九日宣判。另王秋根沈三郞吳文茂三案，調査一過，改期再訊。</p>
<p>又高檢處起訴孫忠和，張阿五，黃鶴亭等漢奸嫌疑案，徐晋榮等因罪證不足，故不予起訴。</p>
<h3>蘇五强電信會議盧宗澄奉派出席</h3>
<p>國際電台管理工程師盧宗澄，奉令派往莫斯科參加代表我國出席五强電信會議，即日乘機飛港轉俄。前晚由環球無錢電報公司假座美國總會設筵歡送。</p>
<h3>霍慕藺在滬逝世　工程界同聲悲悼</h3>
<p>霍慕藺，（見圖）廣東南海縣人，復旦大學工學士，美國康乃爾大學土木工程碩士。抗戰時期，對於後方各綫鐵路工程，頗多供獻，勝利後，於卅五年四月來滬，任京滬區鐵路工務處正工程師工程踝課長，　　經營倍著勛績，不幸於九月五日逝世，八日火葬，工程界同人極爲悲悼。</p>
<h3>又一海蘇輪抵滬　招商局準備接收　美巡洋艦一艘離滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局前自美購來勝利輪，改稱海蘇號該輪現在瑞鎔船廠修理中。昨晨另有一海蘇輪到滬，係怡和洋行外洋部代理，據稱該輪亦係招商局在美所購四輪之一，由溫哥華裝運麵粉一千餘噸來滬，現泊南市浦面九。十號浮節，一俟來貨卸淸，即移交與招商局。聞第一艘海蓉號，的十八日可抵滬，該輪有大批鐵路枕木裝來，第三艘海衡號，的二十六日來滬，第四輪將於下月初抵滬。均將由該局次第接收。</p>

<h3>女招待領職業證　警局即開始辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕酒吧間及咖啡館之女招待，按原則言，絕對不能伴舞。然本市女招待，多有兼營伴舞者，警局以爲彼等行爲與舞女無異，現各舞塲旣皆納稅，則「吧女郞」即有逃稅嫌疑。故曾請示市府，是否須加以限制。茲悉該項建議，已得市府之核准，現警局並已擬定管理規則，將命令全市女招待申領職業證。該項規則，一俟市府通過，即可開始辦理。</p>

<h3>介紹「蘇聯之光」是一部體育影片</h3>
<p>滬光大戲院最近上演一部蘇聯影片，中文名是「蘇聯之光」，內容全是關於最近蘇聯體育運動大會的寫真，極為精彩，我國關心體育者，應該一看，筆者鄭重介紹，希望體育界人仕注意，不要以為「蘇聯之光」是別一種性質的片子，事實上，這正是我國體育界所要看的珍貴電影。全部五彩，顏色鮮美，是蘇聯各聯邦數字千男女選手聚集莫斯科，開運動大會，全部表演各式各樣團體操，配以音樂，動作整齊，節目新穎，場面偉大，全片演一小時餘，可見其長，體育界，體育指導，體育教員，都應該一看，一擴眼界。譯片名的人員，似乎應該負這使人誤會的責任，該片原名為「體育的行進在莫斯科」，但竟被譯成「蘇聯之光」，這一光字不知作何，不知是否譯者故弄玄虛，假使是，那就成為弄巧反拙了。</p>
<h3>增加足球賽速度　英國名足球隊　主修改足球規則　以任意球代替擲球入界</h3>
<p>〔倫敦九日路透社電〕英國亞爾賓足球隊管理，曾十六次入選為英國國際足球代表瑙門鮑賽脫，建議將英國足球協會之足球規則，加以修改。亞爾賓主張將球出界時，現行之擲球入界，改為由對方踢任意球，行之速度，亦可增加。鮑賽脫上季曾在一比賽中用一紀錄表紀錄，全賽九十分鐘，耗於出界球者，計三十五分鐘，鮑氏主張，此項新規則中之任意球，並不能直接射球入球門。英國足球協會今日已在伯明罕球會之球場，指定兩球隊試踢新規則。鮑氏之主張贊助者甚多，英國足球協會中人，亦頗多以為然者。</p>

<h3>紗號吐售多　配紗重實際用戶　紡建開出細布三十六種</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市。稍有波動，早市四十二支線一度開價一九〇萬元，因紡建前日對一般紗號，均照申請配給，紗號業事出意外，大多未曾準備貸款，迫於銀根，頗多願意脫手，後有人趁小扒吸，價遂絡續上升，中午四十二支二百廿四萬有成交，廿支盟鳳，上海棧單一百卅四萬較前日小四萬，廿支　年喊價一百廿萬，惟現貨甚少，雙馬初喊一百四十五六萬後升至一百五十萬成交，最高至一百五十一萬，但銷業不若前週之暢旺，紡建參加民營紗廠聯合委員會對於棉紗盡量供組，上日配出水月雙線期貨甚多，致市價一蹶不振，原開一百九十萬，而市上一百九十五萬有人放售，皆以無力墊款之故，一般觀察在最近期內，紗價不致越軌上升，今日所配仍為一般實際用戶。</p>
<p>第二期配紗仍為三萬包</p>
<p>紡建調查課發表，該公司此次為抑平棉紗作價，確立配售制度，第一批共計總數為三萬包，其中民營工廠，所攤派之二萬包已於昨日全部配竣，今日起開始配售本公司之一萬包，棉紗如此次配售結果，對於黑市價格未能抑平，則公司當局決一本初衷，繼續舉辦第二次配售，其數量業經決定，仍以三萬包為標準。</p>
<p>紗號陳苦衷求恢復配給</p>
<p>本市棉紗字號共有四百余家，曾祖織上海市紗業商業同業公會，由唐志良為理事長，該會以紡建公司，對於具歷史八十餘年之棉紗字號，最近不予配給棉紗，而直接配給居間人之販售商與複制商，即染織廠，內衣廠，巾被廠，手帕廠，針織棉織廠等五團體，其理由因恐販售商居簡操縱，抬價囤積等嫌疑，故過去三星期中毫無配給，認為差誤，據該會沈伯琴稱：遜清時代該業毫無組織，僅有土紗出品，嗣由印度與日本先後進口棉紗，俗稱為「洋紗」，旋有英商船怡和，老公茂等紗廠，經聶雲臺等自設紡織廠後，逐年增加，迄今國營紗廠有一百廿萬紗錠，關於棉紗字號代客自由買賣有四十餘年，初在青蓮閣茶會，並無公會，繼有日商取引所等交易所買空賣空，投機囤積等行為，後奉中央令組同業公會，戰前均由會員紗號買賣與複商，現則會員反向複製高購求剩余棉紗，會員紗號購進後，再轉售與小工業廠商，有同豐祥藝華售出中紡公司「實船牌棧單為憑，同業公會會員，不但無抬價買賣，反由複製商有權售與紗號，因於昨日下午三時在寧波路同和裏四號該公會茶會招待本市新聞界，報告該會歷史，過去居問販售情形，及目前各會員號反為無紗營業之苦衷，希望紡建公司明瞭該會經過，並今後仍恢復配給棉紗，以維業務雲。</p>
<p>訂繳款辦法意在杜冒領</p>
<p>紡建公司業務處，以近來購貨客戶眾多，繳款擁擠，為便於檢核起見，規定自即日起，凡客戶繳款，以每戶一張票據（銀行錢莊劃線本票）為限，其數額應與準購單總額相符，凡以零數湊成之票據，概不接收，又戶名不同之准購單，不得合併繳款，以免錯誤，又防止客戶買賣准購單，又悉該公司以近來分發准購單時，常有各廠號冒領繳款情事，嗣後如有發現，除停發棧單外，對於所繳之款，亦不予發還雲。</p>
<p>現開工七成兩廠已停工</p>
<p>茲據該公司業務處負責人稱，以節電影響，現開工之十九廠中，現有同興大豐兩幫宣告停工，惟其餘各廠，則日夜開工，其生產量原有錠數八十萬枚，現開工錠數達六十二萬枚，計開工率佔百分之七十，棉布產量每日達一萬六千疋，棉紗產量每日達九百件。</p>
<p>棉布尚平穩紡建照原價</p>
<p>棉布市價平平，藍V字初開六萬二千元，後即下降至六萬一千五百元成交，嗶嘰有喊六萬三千元者，但並無成交，無牌細布喊五萬三千五百元，收進者多為現貨，至棧單貨則小五百元，各種色布，大致平平，大陸一九〇士林九萬五千元，九如深士林九萬四千元，雙鹿元細布六萬六千元，斜紋六萬五千五百元，紡建開出本牌細布等卅六種，仍照原價，三A彩球五萬三千元，無牌細布五萬二千五百元，又開出美墨印布十九種等。</p>
<h3>放欵手續費</h3>
<p>財部令嚴予取締</p>
<p>「本報訊」銀行放款利率，依照規定，應以當地中央銀行之牌告為准，但現在當地各行局，往往有超過中央銀行牌告，而將超過部份化為手續費等名目，此點是否合法，應否取締。四聯總處已接財政部京錢庚三字第一六八六號函認為不當，著即嚴予取締，聞四聯總處已分函六總行局知照。</p>
<h3>市場演習漸有進步　證交週一可望開拍　首批審查未准之經紀人重播補繳證件呈部核奪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證交於昨日上午全部演習交割及對帳手續，仍採分組對帳制，演習結果，雖仍不無小錯誤發生，惟證交當局，認為成績確較昨日又有進步。今日仍將繼續綜合演習，上午演習交易，下午演習交割對帳。聞已擬定下週一實行正式開拍，下午交易暫緩，須待各經紀人在收市後兩小時內，對帳手續可以充份齊備，而集體對帳又能應付裕如，始行開拍雲。</p>
<p>又證交籌委會，於昨日下午召開第十六次會議。席間對經部首批審查未核准之各經紀人，業奉部令再加補繳之各證件，重予審查，以便呈部再核。又關於證交日前日劇經財兩部請示兩點：（一）速頒交易稅征收辦法。（二）速定保證金代用品部份之規定辦法。議請顧委員會善昌再度赴京，請求從速批示辦法，以便遵辦。又籌委會籌備事宜，即將告一段落。結束後各項會務，即將移交證交理事會辦理雲。</p>
<p>又訊，經紀人業務，前僅限定一種，現股票及債券兩種，均可兼做，惟須同時另繳保證金五千萬，應繳現金兩千萬，各經紀人正補繳中。</p>
<h3>生砂跌進配價糖市漸次改觀</h3>
<p>昨糖市因公司方面第十三期又有開出，中砂價為十四萬原盤，生砂減萬元為十二萬元，故市勢疲弱不堪，公會劃肋最低均跌進公司開價，而尤以生砂為甚，中砂白現貨為十四萬四五千元，碼頭交貨十四萬二三千元，棧單十三萬九千元至十四萬元，生砂與公司價竟差八九千元，最小為五百元至二千元，其他土糖間有少數成交，提莊青叫十二萬元未成交。</p>

<h3>營業稅分級征收　本市可訂單行法　市商會函請參議會提議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會頃准本市化學原料商業公會函請，特向本市市參議會建議，請參酌戰前成案，改訂本市征收營業稅單行章程。原函略雲：查營業稅，除依照民國二十年六月立法院議決之營業稅法辦理外，大都就稅法範圍之內，另就地方情形，訂有單行規則，以期因地制宜。抗戰軍興，政府將營業稅劃歸中央，以期充實軍需。各省市因地制宜之只法，均歸廢止。徵稅辦法，既失彈性，商民負擔不免偏重。雖經敝會迭呈財政部，請其恢復上述辦法，奉批總以稅法為詞，未允變通。現在營業稅已恢復戰前系統，即將改歸市政府徵收。而本年八月十六日行政院修正公布之營業稅法施行細則，並無各省不得自訂單行章則之限制。是敝會援引從前辦法三項，當有予以恢復之可能。擬請貴會建議市府，參照民國二十一年本市所訂徵收營業稅單行章則，及稅率分率表，由財政局制成草案，呈府咨交貴會核議，俾利施行。</p>

<h3>金鈔均微跌</h3>

<h3>萬人爭看浙江潮</h3>
<p>— 本報七日杭州訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>錢塘江的海潮，是素來負有盛譽的。遠在唐，宋，元，明年間，每逢農歷八月十八日，許多達官貴人都到錢塘來看潮，遜淸時，代乾隆皇帝兩度到海寗觀潮，並以極鉅大的國帑來重修海神廟，表示修理石塘果然是皇帝的功績，但皇帝是「天」之子，皇帝崇敬海神，也要老百姓們跟着虔誠的膜拜，這　拜就是要老百姓們相信皇帝，無法奪取皇帝位置。</p>
<p>邇來由南京，無錫，常州，蘇州，上海等地來杭觀潮者，日益躍踴，各旅館均吿客滿，所有去海寗車輛被定一空，杭市各處充滿京滬綫上之鄕音，各飲食店，娛樂塲，水菓攤，英不利市三倍，預料十三日（即舊曆八月十八日），此閒將有四萬人往海寗觀潮。</p>
<h3>京滬一帶二萬人要看潮</h3>
<p>民國以來，八月十五日以後的觀潮者更多，從杭州七堡起，到海寗陳汶港以上，接述的擁塞着觀衆，京滬都有專車放到杭州，或是由長安轉車到海寗；那堡七到海寗這一條長長的海塘上，許多人褡着看台，設置着飲食攤，還有設臨時中西菜館的。海寗更不消說了，人山人海，大小旅館都客滿，客棧裏甚至祗要有一席地，就可以賣很高的價錢，半夜裏，有幾個人等潮，不睡覺，在人家睡酣時，突然叫一聲：「潮來了！」客人們趕忙穿衣，爭看這一年一度的錢江潮。雖然大家上了一個當，但還是笑瞇瞇的沒有什麽怨言。</p>
<p>八年抗戰期中，杭州海寗先後淪陷，日本人最怕我們的游聲隊，不准擁集着人，潮，聲勢俱厲的來了，但沒有岸上人助威，也就悄悄地去了，只是石塘坍了不少。</p>
<p>去年（民國卅四年）敵人剛投降，雖然潮可以看了但大家沒有情緒，也沒有胆子去看潮，因爲這條路到底好走不好走，還不知道呢。今年（卅五年）的七月裏，京滬一帶已經在醞釀「看潮團」的組織了，雖然在農歷八月初旬，兩路局說長寗路路面不平，不開專車，但是看潮的人還是有着準備的，據我知道京滬一帶起碼有兩萬人要去看潮；單就杭州來講：大小機關團體都有人準備去看潮，商界更多了，有的己經包了汽軍，有的已經在接洽交通工具。中國旅行社，還有幾家汽車行都組觀潮團去觀潮，相信農歷八月十八日這一天，如果天晴的話，一定會把杭州變成萬人空巷的。</p>
<h3>海寗店舖　都在裝璜佈置</h3>
<p>海寗這方面，已經在淸理海濱公園，搭看台，各家店家都在裝璜佈置，有些人家特別讓出來做旅店和飲食店，這許多店舖都在勾心鬥角，出奇制勝，競做生意。只是海神廟坍得不像樣了，市容毀壞得不成體統了，只好在　垣敗互的堆上蓋搭一些棚屋，作爲經商的基地，高張蒲汽油燈，作爲招徠主雇的標幟。</p>
<p>爲什麼農歷八月十八日這一天特別熱鬧呢？以往皇帝的規定，這一天是潮神（也即是海神）的誕生日，有許許多多的農胞，果然爲了潮汎而去膜拜，也有許多時髦的人去湊湊熱鬧，也到海神廟米燒香，當然他們主要的目的還在看潮。</p>
<p>根據科學家的硏究：潮形成的因素是日月光綫的幅射吸引關係。幅射到某種程度，潮汐即隨之而生，又因爲月球更接近地球，所以潮汎往往決定於月球的移轉。我們的農曆是根據月亮來計算的，所以逢農曆每月十五這一天潮必大，而八月十五至十八尤大</p>
<p>以整個地球來講，南半球僅有兩方土地，和一個大半島，所以南半球可說是一片汪洋，他受了月光的照射，於是潮是一件普通的事，不過這種潮是原始潮，漲落僅差一尺。由南邊的海洋流入了北邊廣大平原的邊緣，因爲海岸窄闊不同的關係，所以激成了比較高大的浪潮。像錢江這樣的海潮，世界上並非絕無僅有，即是加拿大紐芬蘭之間的潮，高低也有五十尺，我國的海州灣，高低也相差有兩丈，不過他漲潮時需要六小時的時間，退潮時也需要六小時的時間，不像錢江海潮漲落這樣的迅速。</p>
<p>錢江潮的有名，是在有「潮頭」Tidal　of　Bore；即是在漲潮相差五分之一的時間突漲，再隔四十幾分鐘又漲這樣地成就了奔騰澎湃，猶如千軍萬馬，蠭擁而來的奇觀。所以世界很多水紋學家也都來浙江研究。</p>
<p>我們中國的人民，往往只知看潮，而不知道潮之由來，和浙江潮的奇處，究竟在那裏？甚至有許多人以爲眞的海神在作弄，海神在顯威，海神在現靈呢。</p>
<p>（一）潮影（二）潮，遠遠地來了（三）奔騰（四）澎湃（五）怒潮（六）迎潮神（特派員儲裕生寄）</p>
<h3>錢江潮汐　總會帶來慰藉</h3>
<p>根據科學，來測定潮來的時間，大概農曆十五日那天，在十二時十五分，（節的時間以下同）十六日那天在十三時，十七日那天，在十三時四十五分，十八日那天在十四時三十分，而以後每日潮來時的遞减四十八分鐘，潮也因爲到了高潮期；慢慢地低小了，到每月十日起又慢慢地高起來。</p>
<p>我們對於「潮」，實在不應無知地向它膜拜就了事，因爲這種膜拜並不能使它就終止冲毀你的堤防，冲毀你的家園的。我們更不是消極的加以防禦就可了事，因爲消極的防禦是防不勝防的，兵法上曾說過：「備前後患，備後前患，無所不備，無所不患也。」所以最積極最善良的方法，只有加以因勢利導的去運用它。</p>
<p>許多水利工程專家吿訴我：「我們要整治錢塘江，要把河床規劃，使水有一定的　道，不致東西流跋、潮來時可利用之以爲水力發電，這千萬匹潤力的電力可以蓄積起來加以運用。」是的，這個計劃還待硏究，還待努力，但我們有理想，就有成功，有努力終會有結果的。</p>
<p>我們堅決反對以往無知的去　拜潮神，我們是二十世紀的人民，要挺起來和海潮戰鬥，只要我們這些以看潮作消極享樂的人和江浙人民的持績努力，錢塘江畔的潮汐終有一天會帶給我們以無限的慰藉的。</p>

<h3>公用事業價格不應太高　建議市參議會核定合理標準</h3>
<p>本市市公用局爲發展本市公共交通，積極增加該局所辦之公共汽車數量及開闢新路綫，凡我市民莫不稱頌。惟該局最近開闢行駛之路綫其票價過高，實與便利市民交通之旨不符，且其過份之利潤，亦應由我市民隨時糾正之。</p>
<p>査該局於九月初，開始行駛六路公共汽車自曹家渡至老西門，其票價分一百·二百·三百·四百·五百元五種。然本年春間各公用事業價格調整之時，該局規定公共汽車之最高價不得超過三百元，敌該局之三路及法商電車公司之廿二路公共汽車之現行最高票價均爲三百元。査六路公共汽車行駛路程，並不長於三路公共汽車，然其最高票價之差竟達二百元，即成五與三之比例。即以同樣里程而論，六路票價至少比三路大三分之一，蓋三路公共汽車之票價僅分爲一百·一百五·二百·二百五·三百元五種也。故六路公共汽車之票價即市公用局抬高其自己主辦之公用事業價格之實例。</p>
<p>本市民對公用局此項揹置表示反對之理由如下：</p>
<p>（一）據估計六路公共汽車票價比戰前同樣哩程公共汽車之票價約漲四千餘倍，其倍數與市府公布之八月份工人生活指數四千五百餘倍相接近，在此高物價聲中市府公布之生酒指數所以僅爲此數者，因對生活消　中一部份水電公共交通之指數計算較低也，故公用事業之價格，安能與生活指數同樣上漲，况公用局所自辦之事業乎？</p>
<p>（二）現本市各項公用事業中利潤最厚者、首推公用交通事業，而交通事業中允以公共汽車爲最。蓋現乘客非常擁擠，汽油低廉，然票價所漲倍數甚鉅。（例如，電燈費僅漲五百餘倍而公共汽車的漲三千倍）本市公用局之三路公共汽車等，及法商紅色公共汽車之營業，非僅不會虧本，且有驚人利潤可得。此點可請——市參議會調查即知。現行票價，旣有非常利潤可得，何以公用局新闢之六路公共汽車遽增票價，增加市民負祖，猶如在托辣斯之塲面下，使市民就範。</p>
<p>本市民欲請——市參議會及輿論界對此事注意之理由如下：</p>
<p>（一）本市公共交通亟待發展，公用局及法商電車公司均預備在不久之將來增加路綫，若增加路綫即增加票價，企圖過份利潤，實與公用事業之原則不符。故爲現在及將來市民福利計，市參議曾及全體市民對於公用局此項措置不能忽視。</p>
<p>（二）本市公用事業之漲價，均經市公用局核定。然市公用局所辦之公共汽車票價由何人核定，決不能由公用局自己決定。故本人提議公用局主辦之公用事業價格，應由市民決定之，亦即由——市參議會核定之。（張蒙）</p>
<p>徵實果如此辦麼？</p>
<p>編輯先生：我是個旅居蘇州的橫涇人，一家數口，單靠祖遺僅有不足維持生活所需的田產，今年政府頒令預借徵實田賦，這是普遍性的。且報上規定管業每畝四百元，自業每畝八百元，國家的賦稅，人民當然應該負擔，毋用諱言的。不過我區橫涇攤借得太不公正，眞有出人意料之外者，最大的自業田，每畝要攤借到五六七升不等，所以要如此攤法的內容，無從得悉。不過借先不借後，倒還在其次，更不寒而慄的，借賦必須要折價繳款，繳米則不收，或直接解縣等語，折價規定五萬元，（當時定價糙米市價四萬元左右）歷來完賦，向係將糙米價格作標準，爲何本年預借田賦，反而要改收自米。政府旣明令徵實，而業戶等有繳米的，何故又拒絕不收？不繳則又急如星火，這得小民焦頭爛額，呼籲無門！繳款後，又無憑據，只憑經造一人，以後如何扣算倒串，皇皇國賦，手續如此簡單，太嫌輕描淡寫。非但不能取信於民，實有損害國家的威信。現在聽說再將收到的款子，（每石五萬元折價款子）到各鄕採購秈米，（價三萬五千元左右）據云：每石可盈餘一萬多元，聞全區共借數百石，一轉手間，穩可到手數百萬元之巨。倘果若此，將何以對國家人民！（憂人）</p>
<p>為私校敎師鳴不平</p>
<p>編輯先生鑒：前見敎育局頒佈私校敎師之薪金，爲收費百分之七十，其餘百分之卅，爲校方開支，這是窮敎師之福音。但近有上海西區私立某小學。其收費每生平均十萬元，學生大約三百多人，但十位敎師之薪金，每月底薪，爲一百五十元·以七百廿倍計算，其他之津貼，完全取消。請問這是否係敎育局所規定？敎育局對私校能否管轄與懲戒？我是一個小學五年級生，持爲敎師鳴不平！（學生沈士英）</p>

<h3>癆病防治之近代觀（上）</h3>
<p>— 吳紹青</p>
<p>數年前，雖有日本及納粹軍國主義予人類之安全以極大之威脅，其實癆病之危險實有過之而無不及。我國抗戰八年，死亡軍民經公佈者，總數為三百一十萬人，因癆病一症而致死亡者，去年一年內估計約有四百五十萬人。美國情形，亦復如此。美國在第二次世界大戰自參加後頭一年中，戰亡北將士共一萬七千人，在同時期內，美國國內因癆病一症而致死亡者其總數字超出七萬人以上。有形之敵人固然兇猛，而肉眼所不能見的癆菌，實更為可怕，更為危險。就上海一隅而論，癆病之猖獗，實駭人聽聞。在民國卅一年前六個月，當時英法兩租界居民癆病死亡人數為二千二百六十九，而七種法定傳染病死亡總數不過一千〇二。是則癆病一症之死亡率，超過七種傳染病死亡總數百分之一百四十一、六。現在日本軍聞雖已被驅逐境外，而更凶猛之敵人，仍混跡吾人之家庭機關團體工廠學校及整個社會國家，任其蔓延滋長，每年屠殺四五百萬無辜人民，而令其死亡臥床褥者恐更十倍於是。猖獗如此之甚，其於民族健康關係何其重大。況患此症者大都數均在年齡二十至四十五歲之間，壯年有用之期消糜於病床，經年累月，終至斷送生命，人力物力之損失，何能統計。上海一市如此，即其他各省市又何莫不然。略舉弊端，以應社會人士之參考。</p>
<p>癆病為傳染病</p>
<p>傳染病與遺傳病是二事。甲有肺癆，因接觸而傳給乙者，是為「傳染」。父母有病而從血內傳給胎兒者，是為「遺傳」。肺癆為傳染病，故在公共衛生上發生一種意義。蓋一人有病，可影響全家；一職員生病，可危及團體。害羣之馬，不能不加以管制，於是防癆之舉，由此而興。歐美各國對於癆病一症，均認為法定傳染病之一，並經法律規定，凡患此症者必須施以隔離和治療。就美國情形而論，凡患癆病者如有危及他人之安全，經檢舉後，警局拘捕該病人，送入病院，強迫隔離。甚至病人住院治療經若干時後，病狀顯示痊愈，而痰內間或仍不免含有癆菌，如該病人要求出院，醫師有權拒絕；倘其不聽醫言，擅自出院，醫師可報告衛生當局，加以干涉，令其復入院診治，務求達到痰內癆菌消滅殆盡，然後始准其離院。可見防癆是衛生行政上之責職，換言之，即國家衛生機構應有之事業，此就「防」字立場上之意義而言也。</p>
<p>防癆應有之工作</p>
<p>我國科學落後，對於癆病一症而無統籌防治設施。縱或有若干熱心社會事業人士，興辦防癆協會，以及一般肺癆病院，皆大都偏重於治療工作。須知防治兩事，必須相輔而行。防而不治，無以善其症；治而不防，不足以杜其源。治已成之癆，猶之救燎原之火，縱或可以撲滅，而損失已為不資，防未成之癆，猶之曲突徙薪，稍加注意，可免遭大患。所以防癆與治癆，關係至為密切，即不可偏重，又不可偏廢，必須平衡發展，以收最高之效率。</p>
<p>防治既不可分，則全整工作計劃，大略書之，可分下列數項：</p>
<p>（一）衛生教育，</p>
<p>（二）早期診斷，</p>
<p>（三）公共衛生護士之設置，</p>
<p>（四）肺病診療所，</p>
<p>（五）設備健全之肺病療養院，</p>
<p>（六）病人職業之改善及　後輔導之設施。</p>
<p>以上六項，並不能謂新穎。我國有識之士，亦曾早提及之，惜無近代科學設備和方式而實現之。美國今日癆病死亡率，較之五十年前，減低百分之八十。考究其能有此偉大成績者，則不外此全備防治工作之實施。茲將以上六項工作，分別或歸納申述之。</p>
<p>（一）衛生教育……此為防癆中之主要工作。凡能以教育方法能達到防癆目的者，所付之代價有限，而收效甚大。我國一般習慣太不衛生，時至今日，仍停滯於宣傳「禁止吐痰」之階段，其他關於癆症防治之常識，更為幼稚。衛生程度之低落，於此可見一斑。而教育之迫切需要，更為明顯。教育之方式，種類甚多，總之視對象程度之高低而採取適當有效方法。如總佈有聲電影，以及其他各種「視聽教育」之方式。務求家諭戶曉，未病者知所防範，已病者知所就醫。其收效之偉，不能以數字計。（未完）</p>
<h3>肺癆病之癥狀</h3>
<p>— 靳寶善</p>
<p>肺癆病之症狀，極為複雜，為敘述便利起見，分為肺癆病之初起症狀，一般症狀及局部症狀。</p>
<p>（甲）肺癆病之初起症狀，極不一致。最普通者為體重減輕，極易疲倦，作事乏力，消化不良，或月經失常，貧血及意志不易集中等症狀。數週後或數月後，午後發熱，咳嗽吐痰，盜汗等正規症狀，相繼而起。有時初起情況形似流行感冒，患者有發熱，四肢無力，周身酸痛等症狀，一兩週後，症狀消失，數週後又復發矣。有時患者第一自覺症狀為痰中帶血或咯血。有時肋膜炎為肺癆之初起病狀，其症狀為胸部疼痛，深呼吸及運動可使疼痛加劇，發熱及呼吸困難等。肺癆之初起形似大葉性肺炎者較少，僅見於年青患者及年老衰弱之患者，其症狀與大葉性肺炎相同，但其病癧較長，痰中含有癆菌及空洞之形成，可資鑑別。亦有患者因聲嘎，肛門瘻，肛門　腫及勁部淋巴腺腫大之故，檢查肺部，始知患肺癆病。</p>
<p>（乙）一般症狀</p>
<p>（一）發熱　大多數患者體溫在午前常為正常，午後漸高，午後四點至八點最高。慢性及病情輕微者，於靜養後或病情進行遏止後，熱度漸為降低，以至正常。如病情沉重或病情擴散時，熱度即繼續不斷，呈各種熱型。如初起形似大葉性肺炎及肋膜炎或有其他併發症者，熱度繼續不斷，午後較午前為高，如此可經多日，漸變為輕度發熱，延長至數週之久。肺癆之初期患者及復發之初期患者於極度運動後，常有輕度午後發熱，但靜後，即復正常。重度慢性患者有時熱度午前極高，午後較低，與肺癆之普通熱型恰相反。</p>
<p>（二）盜汗　盜汗少見於無熱期及初期之患者，急性及慢性重症者常有盜汗之現象，盜汗常見於夜間，最多見於黎明時。</p>
<p>（三）體重減輕　體重減輕以病情之輕重而異。急性患者體重減輕極快，反之慢性患者則減輕較慢，肺癆患者若予以正當護理後，體重仍繼續減輕，則後多不良。</p>
<p>（四）疲倦無力　初期患者每日工作之餘，常覺疲倦無力，若病情變劇，患者於清晨即覺怠惰無力，意志消沉。</p>
<p>（五）面色蒼白及貧血　此種症狀多見於重度患者，若患者兼有腸癆，貧血症狀更為顯著。</p>
<p>（六）患者常消化不良，食慾不振，時有惡心嘔吐，大便秘結或腹瀉等症狀。若腹部常有腸絞痛，大便失常，有時便秘，有時腹瀉，為腸癆之暗示。</p>
<p>（七）婦女患者之月經呈失常之現象，初不規則，繼為經血減少，甚或月經閉止。若患者病情轉佳，月經可復原狀。</p>
<p>（丙）局部症狀</p>
<p>（一）咳嗽　為局部主要症之一，患者常以咳嗽之故，延醫診治。初期患者之咳嗽常為輕微之乾咳，病情轉劇時，咳嗽亦轉劇。若喉部及氣管亦有癆病之發生，則咳嗽甚痛且極窘迫。，時有喉鳴之症狀。</p>
<p>（二）吐痰　咳嗽與吐痰常相連繫，初期患者痰甚稀少，時或有極少之明亮粘液形痰液。在肺癆之後期，吐痰為普通之症狀，若在空洞之形成，痰量更為增多，肺癆患者之痰無特殊之點，且甚顏色亦不一。</p>
<p>（三）咯血（吐血）　肺癆患者之有咯血現象約佔半數。咯血之程度不一，普通為痰中帶有血絲或血塊，有時血量較多，痰呈紅棕色，大量咯血當見於有空洞之患者，大量咯血常無預示，僅於咯血前喉部有鹹味感覺或熱感，有時於咯血前患者覺胸部悶脹，大量咯血可使患者氣塞，數分鍾內即死亡，有時發生咯血後之癆病性肺炎，使病情擴散，預後多不佳。一般而言，咯血當自停止，但有復發之虞，故患者有咯血之症狀時，須十分注意飲食，勿過度勞動及作風感冒，免致復發。</p>
<p>（四）胸部疼痛　若肺癆侵及肋膜，發生肋膜炎，患者常訴胸部疼痛，或甚輕微，僅有悶感，或為劇烈之刺痛，陰天及疲倦時更甚。</p>
<p>（五）聲嘎　咳嗽頻繁，可致聲嘎，頑固性之聲嘎常為喉癆所致。</p>
<p>（六）呼吸困難　患者於發熱時及病情沉重時，常訴呼吸困難，若呼吸困難突然發生，須注意自動性氣胸及滲出性肋膜炎之發生。</p>

<h3>吾人對肺癆應有之認識</h3>
<p>— 崔祥賓</p>
<p>（一）肺癆與年齡</p>
<p>普通人皆認為肺癆病為少年人與在青春時期者所最易招致之疾病。過了卅歲就認為不會再被肺癆病所傳染；即其不幸而在卅歲以後所得之肺癆病，其病情定較少年時所得之一般病情為緩和，且絕不至於致命。實際上此乃一錯誤觀念。須知肺癆之傳佈，是不擇年齡者。卅歲以後而始得進行性肺癆之病例，實已不勝列舉。此等病者之病情，雖有較在青春時期所得肺癆為緩和，惟若不在發現後即加以注意及醫療，其病情亦日趨惡化，蔓延之速與少年人所得之肺癆，並無二致。美國一九四零年肺癆病死亡率統計，百分之四十三肺癆病者之死亡乃在四十五歲以後之病者。由此更可證明吾人認為肺癆病在卅歲以後之患者亦不足以致命之誤解。</p>
<p>（二）忌口問題</p>
<p>因有某種病而需要忌口，其最顯著之例證為腎髒炎之病者忌食鹽類。因血液內鹽分增加容易使局部或全身有水腫現象。還有糖尿病患者食物內之炭水化合物應有一定份量；並且炭水化合物，脂肪及蛋白質之比例，亦應有一定之公式，否則即能引起種種不幸。以上二種疾病患者之忌口，皆有實際或理論上之根據而施行者。惟有肺癆病者及咯血者，亦常有人認為需忌食葷腥若干時日。此等病者之忌口，實屬費解，在目前肺癆病尚無特效藥以道，不外注意營養及加強病者對於癆病之抵抗力。加強病者抵抗力之不二法門，為增加日常營養，多食容易消化而富於滋養之物品，如雞蛋·牛奶·魚·肉之屬。若此類葷腥皆為肺癆患者所屏棄，於是日當所進，僅能以荳類，青菜為限。如是二三月後，病者之體力非但不能有所增加，反日趨瘦弱，於是體內之癆菌，乃得機活動，四處蔓延矣。是以勸告一般癆病患者：除有極高而不少退之寒熱，或有其他併發症時，多吃素淨以利消化外，否則總應以多吃有熱量及油葷之食物為合理。</p>
<p>（三）出場肺癆</p>
<p>「出場肺癆，一見就成功」是通俗常見之標語，只要過路人讀一遍，自家小孩的傷風就此脫體了。出賣肺癆之標語雖未正式公開，惟有種肺癆病者深信倘能將自己的癆病菌傳染給他人，自己之病雖不能痊癒也至少可以打個大折扣。此等病者於是有意和無辜小孩一床並面睡，一同吃一碗內之食物；甚至於自己吃剩下之食物，要叫家人吃光。而自己所親近之人物不敢不順承病者之旨意，只好照樣吃做。家人又不忍與病者分碗筷。還有相信肺癆能夠出賣之人們，彼等惟恐不及早被傳染到，以期病者之癆病早日脫體。此種事情當然皆發生於毫無知識之家庭中。對於病者是絕對損人而不利己；而對於希望能被傳染到以減輕病人之痛苦者亦屬非非之想，其結果不外使家庭中再多添一位肺癆病者而已。</p>
<p>（四）乾血癆</p>
<p>婦女月經失常而名之為乾血癆者，乃絕非因癆菌盤據卵巢或其他生殖器官之謂也。月經失常乃肺癆病者　通症狀之一。若病情好轉，月經當亦日趨正常，並無一般人所謂乾血癆無藥醫之理論。</p>
<h3>癆病特效藥問題</h3>
<p>— 張昌紹</p>
<p>癆病，這個人類最大的災難之一，使英雄氣短，使紅顏薄命，使天才夭折，也使醫生搖頭，是人類健康的大敵，醫藥衛生上的大問題。</p>
<p>多少世紀以來，人們不斷地努力，覓求治癆的特效之藥，但是不管他是迷信的仙方，民間經騐的單方，或是實騐室的產物，沒有一樣能經得起科學的嚴格的考騐。許多所謂癆病特效藥之流，初出現時莫不被宣傳得轟轟烈烈，將其功效說得千真萬確，但是到頭來還是證明不值一文，毫無用處，一盆冷水，澆得醫生與病人同叫上當，同感失望。</p>
<p>抗戰以前報紙上常登廣告的那些所謂癆病特效藥，如什麼草什麼星類的滑頭藥，其不科學或假科學的情形甚為明顯，反正其目的在騙錢，應在政府取締之列，這裏暫不置論。就是經過科學研究的藥物，如Sanocrysin，Lopion等金製劑，如種種Tuberculin製劑，亦經不起時代的淘汰，除極少數的情形或可一試外，現已乏人問津矣。</p>
<p>近年來因磺胺類藥物（Sulfonamices）治療多種細菌性傳染之劃時代的成功，使吾人對於癆病之特效治療，燃起新的希望。而這種新的希望卻建築在完整的科學的實騐基礎上面，雖然到現在為止還沒有一種確實滿意的治癆特效藥，比從前那些藥物，確是大大地進了一步。</p>
<p>在一九三九年至一九四〇年間，試騐管內的實騐，證明磺胺類能抑制結核桿菌（即癆菌）的繁育；動物的實騐亦證明此類藥物能延緩結核菌病變的進行，但並不能完全阻遏之。</p>
<p>與磺胺類相近的礦類藥物（Sulfones），如普洛明（Promin），大艾松（Diasone）及普洛密坐（Prornisole）等，抑制結核桿菌的作用，遠較磺類為強大，對於動物的結核病確能阻遏其進行，使保持於靜止期。一時各國報章雜誌迫不及待其嚴格臨床實騐之完成，即競相報道，喧傳癆病特效藥之發明，使無數病人欣喜若狂，到處打聽，期待此類神藥之到臨，俾得沉疴立失，重複健康。</p>
<p>但是，動物實騐究竟是動物實騐，其結果往往不能完全適用於人類的疾病。當此類藥物嚴格試用於癆病病人時，即發現其對於人類之毒性太強，應用其安全劑量時，對於癆病並無確實的療效。對於極少數的特殊病例，也許有些幫助，但對大多數的病例並無多大價值。</p>
<p>接著，青黴素（Penicillin）發現了，其傳奇性的療效更傾倒了世人。許多人問著：青黴素對於癆病有沒有用處？一切的實騐均毫無疑義地證明他的無用。但是在中國，竟有一部分人士不肯讓絕望的垂危的癆病人平安地昇天，硬要「姑妄試之」地給他打上幾針青黴素，這不僅是科學的反面，這也是愛的反面。</p>
<p>但是，與青黴素同類的抗生性物質（Anlibiotic　Substances）中，有幾種確有抗癆的效能。照目前各方報告看來，其中最有希望的當推　黴素（Streptomycin），這是一種稱做Strcjtomyces　griceus的鏈黴在培養中產生的物質。無論在試管內實騐上，或在動物實騐上，鏈黴素的抗癆作用均較磺類藥物高明得多，并且對於人類的毒性亦低得多，現在在病人身上積極試騐之中。目前雖然已有零星的臨床報告數起，說他對於幾種癆病症或有良效；但在系統的臨床實騐結束前，讓吾們不要再蹈覆轍，妄加推測之辭，作不科學的報導。同時奉勸癆病的病人，在可靠的特效藥發明以前，千萬不可守株待兔，對於現在通告的標準治療，不能一日放松疏忽。</p>

<h3>風格與人格</h3>
<p>— 叔孫如瑩</p>
<p>任何藝術作品，都有其獨特的風格。風格並不是指導藝術品的性質，而是指導藝術家的人硌在藝術品上的表現。因此，西洋有「風格即人」的說法。作家的人格。直接影響到藝術品的價值，更直接地影響到藝術品的風格。</p>
<p>雖然如此，我們要研究藝術品的風格，固然要從事於作家人格的研究，而更重要的乃是著眼於藝術品本身，分析它，研究它，從這藝術品中去尋求風格，也就是從藝術品中去尋求藝術家的人格。譬如要研究作為文學家的托爾斯泰的作品的風格，最好暫時不要研究他的傳記，你且把他的全部著作或是大部份著作拿來加以研究分析，你去看「復活」看「戰爭與和平」，看「安娜·卡列尼娜」，你便會了解托爾斯泰所習用的題材，所常寫的人物，以及他對於那些題材，那些人物的看法與態度。更進一步，你去注意托爾斯泰敘述故事的方法和口吻，他怎樣安排結構，怎樣介紹人物，怎樣一面向你說故事，又一面向你說教。這一切便是托爾斯泰的風格，也便是他的人格的一面。自然，你也不妨再去看看托爾斯泰的傳記，去看看俄國文化史，讓你更進一步了解托爾斯泰為什麼會有那樣的風格。但，你該明白，托爾斯泰並不僅僅是一個作為藝術家的人，他也同時是作為覺醒了的地主的典型，以及作家為宣揚人道主義的聖哲，因此，他的人格絕不完全等於他的藝術風格。</p>
<p>風格雖然不等於人格，而風格與人格必須統一和一致。因為托爾斯泰是人道主義者，所以他對世界總是以善的眼光去理解，他同情一切的人，因為他認為一切人都具有人性，那怕是殺人犯也絕對不會例外。所以，他的作品都是那麼誠摯·嚴肅·毫無滑稽諷刺的意味。莫里哀把每一個人都看成小丑，他自己也正是以小丑的身份供役於法國宮庭，因此，他永遠以冷嘲熱諷的手法來創作劇本，任何莊嚴的人物在他筆下都變為滑稽可笑。這便是風格與人格統一的證明。</p>
<p>但是，還值得注意：一個人的人格不是固定的，而是有變動的，有發展的，一個藝術家的風格也是有變動的，有發展的。周作人在當年不過是一個喝苦茶主義者，一變而為漢奸，你決不能武斷周作人在當年就有漢奸思想，但發展到後來，就不得不為漢奸。因此，當我們談到人格風格統一的時候，更得注意到時代的統一。在同一時代，一個作家的人格與其藝術作品的風格必然是統一的，但如果你以早年的周作人的作品風格來與晚年的周作人的人格來談統一，便是忽略了時代統一的條件，犯了論理學上的錯誤了。</p>
<p>總之，風格不等於人格，而風格必須與人絡統一。</p>
<h3>尼采和居友</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>現代文藝思潮，與國際情形本樣，形成兩大壁壘，就是自由世界與編製世界！這兩種世界，在歐洲文藝方面，代表兩種思想，即德國的尼采，與法國的居友，Nitzsche　et　Guyau一個是個人主義，也可說是獨裁專制主義，一個是社會主義，也可說是自由平等主義！</p>
<p>這兩位思想家，在歐洲文藝方面，影響至為偉大，自盧梭倡民約論以後，他們兩位可說是傑出的人物了！在文化交流的觀點上說，凡是不同的思想，都可互相幫助，互相促進，月夜星空，斷不因為鴻飛遮蓋他的光明，狂海怒濤，亦不因為　　，變更他的潮汐！</p>
<p>尼采在一千八百四十年，生在德國Rocken其父是一牧師，家庭貧寒，努力學業，年稍長，結識音樂家華格納，後游瑞士與意大利，從事文學哲學的研究，對一希臘古代文化，尤感興趣，在一千八百七十二年，第一部著作「悲劇的發生」出生，同時醉心叔本華思想，一千八百七十六年以後，身體漸漸失去康健，生活與思想，也隨之變遷，有時到意大利或瑞士山頭休養，有時在大學教課從事著作，生活一天一天地陷於痛苦孤寂，但精神　抗，不斷地有新著作出世！</p>
<p>尼采的思想，唯一重要的是「主人」！以堅強的意志編製自己，也同編製世界一樣，他超越了自由，超越了世界，反抗不幸的運命，提倡超人的哲學，對於華格納與叔本華亦不滿意，他　作「薩都亞斯賣」療治悲劇哲學，　　戰爭，不斷地努力與爭鬥，加　自己的力量，他對人生，永遠是「肯定的」「積極的」「創造的」·要認識最偉大的快樂，應當要認識最偉大的痛苦！而對　極端痛苦前途，同時會遇到極不平凡的新希望！</p>
<p>生命是痛苦的，要知道痛苦能凈化人生！所以尼采歌頌痛苦，讚揚痛苦，他走遍天涯，歷盡磨難，到後業尋覓到自己，也認識了自己！他思想與法國哲學家居友，都是以發展人生為原則，但是尼采的人生，是戰爭是統制！居友的人生，是愛情與社會的連帶的休戚關係！</p>
<p>居友在一千八百五十四年，生在法國Laval，最初即受到良好的母教，其父早死，後其母與符葉結婚，符氏亦當代哲學家，是居友的繼父，幼年喜研究希臘哲學，後任中學教師，可惜身體多病，常到地中海濱名城黎詩休養，一千八百八十八年，時地中海邊大地震，居友臥病多日，且移住小屋，亦潮濕不堪，感受風寒，肺部發炎，從此病重輾轉慶褥，一代少年創造家逝世，年僅三十三歲！</p>
<p>他著作甚多，關於哲學教育宗教道德美學，都有驚人的發現，當時尼采與居友都在「黎詩城」附近過冬天，但兩不相識，尼采也讀過居友著作，其繼父亦時比較他們二人思想，著書專論之，在文藝方面，有「現代美學問題」與「社會觀點上論藝術」，居友認為生命本身，就有無限力量，以求生存，以求發展，生命也如花朵一樣，自己成形，世界如同賽會的佳節，種種的表演，都是生命的光華！偉大的藝術家，生活在眾人的心中，他的生命是全世界的生命，所以他的豐富而充實的創作，絕不是怎麼的小我生命，他由十大的同情上和合宇宙而為我！愛情是整個不能分割的，生活為的別人，快樂也不是能獨享的！藝術的源泉，在全人類深密的心坎中，美感的情緒，產生於社會的同情，「心」永遠是青春的，對世界永遠保留著新鮮的感覺，他發現現實不是粗俗，愈遠觀愈顯出美來，把生活的界限放寬放遠，與未來的新社會接觸，使我們生命愈豐富愈活躍！</p>
<p>真正的詩人藝術家，他們知道太陽的光線，溫暖我們的人心，他們也知道明月的當頭，長夜中照到陰暗的流芳，我們應當懂得春天，許多飛蝶，留戀著花香，我們也應當歡喜，看見燕子筑他的春巢，這都是宇宙的諧和，誰也不能把他據為私有的！世上最愚蠢最空虛的利己主義，在美與善的世界中，不會成立的！居友的哲學，到後來尋覓到最高的同情與宇宙一體的人生！</p>
<p>我追慕這兩行哲學家，同時他們又是詩人！都是從愛慕希臘文化，走到現代新人生的路上，也都是積極地歌頌最美麗的人生！但是二人歸宿不同，一個是同到一個人，幾欲毀滅世界而另造之一個同到社會，陶醉在博大的愛情中，溫暖這痛苦的人生，可惜是居友早死，否則他的發現更偉大呢！至於尼采，何嘗沒有同情？他晚年在意大利北部城中，看見弱馬拖一重車，受鞭　之苦，他抱馬頭而痛哭，從此就在瘋人院裏送終！不過德國法國的社會人情不同，各人的遭遇大異，可見熱情能產生大思想家，熱情也能固執了偏見，走到另一極端的路上，他們二人要能在美麗的黎詩海邊，看到碧水翻起銀波，沙鷗在空中高翔，好像樂譜節拍的樣子，他們談到心坎的深處，也許可能合流到一處源泉！</p>
<h3>空想</h3>
<p>— 子蓉</p>
<p>文藝術語誌三</p>
<p>英語為Imagination。是一種特殊的表象思索。在現實裏所沒有或不可能存在的思索，都謂之空想。但根據過去的經騐或具有現實基礎的空想，則是現實主義的空想。在藝術創作的過程中，空想是一個最重要的因素、有了空想，藝術生命才能夠自由地活動。藝術上的所謂創造的空想，便是活動的中心。</p>
<h3>十五世紀旅</h3>
<p>文藝術語誌四</p>
<p>義大利語為Quattrocento。是義大利十五世紀的文藝的總稱。就是文藝復興的前期。文藝復興期的文藝，總稱為「十六世紀派」。</p>
<h3>老農</h3>
<p>— 葉飛刻</p>
<h3>鞭子</h3>
<p>— 嘯風</p>
<p>在北國的原野上，我乘著馬車，在一條黃沙古道上奔馳，車輪聲和馬蹄聲，奏出了單調的音樂。天空像海一樣的青碧，陽光像火一般的紅熱，汗，在人的身上流著，在馬的身上流著，一陣狂風吹了過來，捲起了一片漠漠的黃沙，像霧一般的瀰漫在原野上，掠過了車篷，吹落到更遙遠的他方。</p>
<p>在風沙中，馬在急促地喘息著，濛濛的沙石，灑落在牠的身上。</p>
<p>「滴見！」車夫揮動他手中的鞭子，沉重地抽打著牠，在風沙瀰漫的原野上，把牠趕向了茫茫的前方去。</p>
<p>在黃昏的原野上，秋天的風在吹。農夫負起他的耕犁，從田間歸去，在那綠草如煙的小道上，一條老牛在慢慢的踏著步子，走向回家的道路，農夫揮起他的長鞭，無情地抽打在老牛的身上，用粗暴的聲音，咒罵這老牛的無用。在痛苦的鞭策中，老牛低著頭走向那茫茫的夜幕裏。</p>
<p>四年前，在一個冬天的晚上，我也會執著堅韌的鞭子，跟隨在犢兒的後面，在碾房中，在昏黃的燈光下，我和犢兒都在石碾旁繞著圈子。母親站在石碾的中間，慢慢地扒著那未碾熟的米穀。這時，我揮動了堅韌的鞭子，不斷地抽打在犢兒的身上，我要驅使牠不停地旋繞，在這小小的圈子上。</p>
<p>悠悠的石碾聲，在為誰泣訴呢？</p>
<p>在廣闊的人海裏，我看見千萬個人在躍動，在這複雜的人羣裏，許多人正握著一根殘酷的鞭子，抽打在牛馬的身上，把牛馬趕到前面去；抽打在別人的身人，把別人當作奴役，任意驅使，把他們趕上戰爭的道路，趕進了黑暗的深窟。</p>
<p>三四年來，我便被這道無形的鞭子不斷地抽打，使我離開了故鄉，向更遼遠的地方走去。在靜靜的深夜裏，我記起了在那黃沙古道上，車夫用手中的鞭子抽打著疲憊的馬；我記起了在黃昏的田野裏，農夫揮起他的長鞭，把老牛趕向茫茫的夜幕裏；我更記起了在四年前那個冬天的夜裏，我揮動那堅韌的鞭子，不斷地驅趕著犢兒；我想起了在這廣闊的人海中，許多人正在揮動他們殘酷的鞭子，無情地抽打在別人的身上，他們笑了，笑得那麼殘酷！</p>
<p>可是，那無形的鞭子，正沉重地落在他們的身上。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風　31</p>
<p>W君說「這一類的例子，我還可以提出幾個來……可見「操守」是很重要的一個條件」。……</p>
<p>小老虎始終在「受訓」的狀態下，凝神靜氣，坐得端端正正，兩手撫住膝頭，腰桿挺得筆直，嘴唇抿得緊綁綁的，圓圓的睜著兩只眼睛；好像在給他拍「派司」照片似的。</p>
<p>（後來紀耀羣告訴我，小虎臨動向的當口，他母親叮囑過他幾句話「……孩子，你年紀不大，也不算小哪；打娘胎練這一身活，（指武藝），雖說抵不了半斤八兩，可也是你爺爺一番心機，還能白糟蹋？……你這一去，闖關過碼頭，為的什麼？還能不賣把氣力，大小巴結個一份口糧，也叫你爺爺，你爹，你大伯，你大叔能吐口氣。……孩子，千不是萬不是，我是你媽，你得聽我的；你跟你紀姨走，將來怕不要見官見府，你得站有站像，坐有坐像……）</p>
<p>我想他這時候，大概是想著「坐有坐像」這句臨別叮囑吧。</p>
<p>「聽說你武功不差」，W君把應說的都說完了，臨時把目標轉到了小老虎身上，「聽岳先生把你的事情，說過一些。叫我們沒練過把式的聽了，簡直是一種奇蹟！好像外國人聽中國「山海經」！」</p>
<p>小老虎也許認為W君要封他官職了，趕緊站了起來，把個小身體堅得挺直。也許聽不懂什麼叫奇蹟，什麼叫山海經，當然不敢問，衹把大眼睛偷著對我和耀羣掃了一下，像電光霍地一閃似的。</p>
<p>「可是」，W君很慎重地說。「我有一句話，你得千萬記住。我國的武把子是好的，也應當極力提倡；但是，我們不能就拿這個東西，當牠一種執行工作的工具。我們的工具是守命令，與同志合作，與前後防各式陣線配合著，進則進，退則退。假如你認為有一種特別能力，就單獨行動，這就壞了事……」W君說到這裏，大約明白小老虎不大能了解這一點，所以瞧了瞧耀羣。</p>
<p>「是」。「耀羣接著就答應，一回頭得跟虎弟弟仔細　解，讓他　底明白」。</p>
<p>「好極了」。W君對耀羣點點頭又回頭瞧著小老虎；「我再說個機巧結你聽，譬如你用練過功夫的手指，處置了一個人，這在對方，用偵察眼光看，是一件特殊事端，極可研究的一種形跡。素來喜歡大驚小怪的劣種根性，當然不錯小題大做起來。弄到這個地步，就以我們普通辯證方式，也很容易探索到誰是執行這個處置的事主。至少，他們可以證明幹這個事的，是那一方面的人，……對不對？</p>
<p>「如果事態弄到如此地步，這就不好的。何以呢？因為根本有許多事，我們辦雖辦了，可不願任何方面知道是我們辦的。請想，假如所辦的事，留了你這麼一種特殊手法的痕跡，那豈非好像印上了商標一般，明明承認這事的事主就是我們麼？……</p>
<p>可我也不願叫你灰心，說這種手法，完全用不得。你下了很多苦功，才學會了這些技術，豈可白白廢掉？不過，衹要看明情形，可用則用，不可用，甯可使用普通方法；就如我們現在已經就用的幾種，——都可沒有特殊痕跡留下。……」</p>
<p>這一大篇，小老虎聽明白了幾句，我可不敢擔保，好在耀羣用他們　子裏的特殊術語一解釋，像小老虎這樣精靈的孩子，沒有不明白的。</p>

<h3>向榮老先生呼籲　——貧寒靑年之聲</h3>
<p>— 江新明</p>
<p>我是一個貸學金學生。</p>
<p>敵偽盤踞上海時期，我先後申請貸學金，幸蒙核准，得繼續升學，度過了這個漫漫的長夜，滿以爲勝利後，我們的生活能够安定了；百物下瀉，每一個人民有職業，每一個學生有書讀，但是，自勝利迄今，父親依舊失業，家庭的經濟狀况日見支絀，我的學費當然還是落了空。在上學期開學前，上海沒有貸學金，這　耗眞像晴天的霹靂，試問那一個淸寒學生不爲之心碎？然而絕處逢生，本市市敎育會舉辦敎育貸金，許多淸寒學生又獲得了一學期求知的機會，我亦是其中的一個。轉瞬，學校又放假了，現在悠長的暑假亦己過去，這兩天，富人家的學生們正準備着買書，繳費上課。</p>
<p>但我這個苦學生就又着急了，這麽貴的學費，如何來應付呢？雖然仍申請敎育貸金。但聽說這一次籌募到的金額和國貨市塲義賣所得的款項離開目標極遠，而申請的同學在一萬人以上，粥少僧多，被淘汰的人一定不在少數。故我每日戰戰兢兢，深恐落選，假若一旦淘汰，那麼我就休想進學校，只有預之門外，我想：除我以外許多淸寒同學亦抱有同樣的心境吧？</p>
<p>因此我借本刋園地一角，向社曾人士呼籲，願有錢的出錢，有力的出力，拋磚引玉，見義勇爲，救救失學靑年啊！</p>
<p>尤淇是我們的榮德生老先生，這次能安然脫險，實吉人天相。而這一筆龐大的贓款業已由榮家領　。短時期內，我希望能有一個適當的處置和明確的表示。見連日報載：榮家確願捐出，充作各慈善事業之用。敎育貸金亦有一部份，所以我再請求榮老先生速給我們這般含嗷待哺的淸寒學生；有一個好消息。雖然您現在得不到什麼效果，然十年後，二十年後……你所栽培的學生佈滿國內外，爲社會服務，爲國家服務時；到處褒楊您的事績，頌讚您的美德！這才是您的收穫和成功。冒昧的話，請榮老先生原諒！</p>
<h3>閒話出洋</h3>
<p>— 小怡</p>
<p>最近，大家都忙着出洋，有的是出國考察，有的是專員代表，有的是接受物資，各色樣的名目齊備。當然更有許多是莘莘學子再求深造的。從前人　刺留學生爲鍍金，其意在金玉其外，敗絮其中，中看而不中用也。現在人說出洋是去觀光原子彈，因爲原子彈是件舉世驚心的玩意兒，這樣出洋自然顯得前途不可限量。</p>
<p>有一個朋友近半年來爲了出洋問題不能解決，弄得少食斷眠；考官費，他的學問不肯帮忙自費吧，照「三三五〇」計算，實在出不起，於是他東　西求，經四個月之努力，居然達到目的。某公司出資送他出洋考察商情，最近他乘梅格將軍號走了，我們都望洋興嘆，羨慕不已！</p>
<p>又某位醫學生也爲了出國深造往來奔走護照問題，神魂不定，後來某煤礦公司造了福，請他去美國代表接受船隻。路道不差！</p>
<p>關於出洋的趣話古今皆有，記得在淸民初末的時候，有位中國駐美大使，每次回國再赴美時，必携帶隨員二十多名，抵岸後，這些隨員必因細故相繼而去。有一次大使到了使館地點，身邊還剩隨員二名，第二天早晨二人因掃地而爭吵，竟大駡起大使，頃刻間，大使自己出來責問二人，立刻撤職，過後旁人問他們爲何如此無禮，他們笑答：「這是我們完好的計策，如果我們不吵架，他就無題使我們離去」。迫根問由，原來道位大使的副業是偸運移民，一千元一名，以他的隨員名義進口，絲毫不着痕跡。</p>
<p>還有一位專號護照的官，曾出賣專員或專家名義的護照，每張美全五百元，許多想喝洋水的人都紛擁而至，後來有些「專」字號的人到了外國，英文一字不識，被人看穿本像。從此護照簽字外人多加留難，替後來出國的人增加無限煩惱。</p>
<p>拉雜說來，不過是爲出洋而想起的一些瑣話，我相信並希望這些瑣話，對今日的辦理出洋，是不會發生諷刺的效用的。</p>
<h3>典當業的窮途</h3>
<p>— 雨人</p>
<p>—上海動態—</p>
<p>據最近報載：本市合法登記營業的典當，已達九百餘家之多，現在一般典當當息四角六分，這樣高的利息，自然引誘得擁有游資的人，躍躍欲試起來。</p>
<p>但典常歟量的多，並不能表現典當業的發達。相反地，現有的普通典當，資本都只在百萬元以下，且以戰爭以來，由於幣制的更換，物價的高漲，遭受了嚴重的打擊。眼前各爿典當，都是門可羅雀，每日上門的生意僅有寥寥數票，甚至在櫃檯上坐了整天，沒有一票上門的也有。喫典當飯的都在感到「味同嚼蠟」，只有那些外行的人却在轉念頭，怎樣來「經之營之」？</p>
<p>以前，典當業也有著它一段「燦爛」的歷史——但在我們窮人看來，不是「燦爛」。却是「凄慘」！——那時物價平穩，利息優厚，多少人家想把兒女送進典當裏去做學徒。戰事發生以後，暴利事業日趨下游，投機囤積之風與日俱長。物價高漲下，典當業滿呈着不景氣，一方面非法押當出現，利息漲到五角六角，限期甚至只有二十天或一月。勝利以後，押店與當店合併，成立了「典當業同業公會」，但直到現在，仍是一蹶不振。</p>
<p>聽說賽馬又要恢復了，一般賭客，在轍得囊空如也的時候，典當裏也許會增加些生意吧！</p>
<h3>新DDT</h3>
<p>— 榮</p>
<p>上星期美國化學界又發明了一種新式殺虫劑，比DDT效力更大，不良反應更少。這種新劑不特能够殺滅吳虫而且可以驅逐其他虫類一個星期至十日之久。它的名稱是「NMRI——四四八。」在戰時，海軍醫學研究所試騐了三千種化學化合物至第四百四十八次才發明這種新式殺虫劑。根據試騐，在熱帶區裏，此劑比其他藥品更有效六倍，而在溫帶區裏，至少更有效兩倍。</p>
<p>此劑能殺滅蚊虫，蒼蠅，沙蚤，臭虫及「銀魚」等。它比較DDT更優良之處是：（一）殺虫殺得快，（二）效力維持長久，（三）並不刺激皮膚或發生其他不良反應，而反覆使用DDT則足以造成慢性的中毒。如果用六滴「四四八」塗在手足及面部，則能驅虫達六個至十個鐘點之久。現在這種新式殺虫劑已經在美國公開出售，每二兩瓶售價爲美金七角五分。（譯自新聞週刋）</p>
<h3>低調</h3>
<p>— 三公</p>
<p>根據行總統計上海市民患性病者的佔全部人口百分之十二，此次職業普査可惜沒有將「賣淫爲業」的確數統計出來，否則倒可以求出賣淫和性病患者的百分率，豈不是一個有趣的統計？</p>
<p>敵僞產業處理局蘇州分處股長黃兆川·兪基善，因凟職會汚，以致斷送了少女常東娥一命，現在黃兪兩犯僅判三年半和一年九月徒刑，常庭竟呼不服，或許是自己覺得所判太輕吧！？</p>
<p>一般機關首長在報吿一件工作時，往往提綱挈領，先說出幾個方針，幾個部門，幾個要要點……；這倒好像分類廣吿中馬樂記福興園一類廚房的四冷盆，八熱炒，六大菜，兩點心一樣。</p>
<p>颱風這東西，實在有些古怪，測它來呢，他倒偏偏不來，測它不來呢，却可能突如其來。有人懷疑着「如之何其測」。我道正因爲天有不測風雲，故「無如其測」，「測之爲測之，不測爲不測，是測也」。</p>

<p>隻身到廣州</p>
<p>十四歲那年，一顆小小的心靈，已爲革命的思潮所激動，偸偸地，隻身潛赴廣州，想參加革命。可是以他幼小的年紀且人地生疏，秘密組織的革命工作，非他所能插足，於是進退維谷，不敢回家。他有堅決意志，事不成，決不回家，寗願度　飄泊的生涯。不久，遂暫入廣州工藝廠當學徒，度其鬥爭的生活。</p>
<p>工作之餘，專心讀書，因所讀之書，多爲當時違禁品，每在深夜偷讀，衾枕之間，私藏着革命的書籍。黃花崗七十二烈士起義之時，他曾欲參加，未獲如願。旋廣州光復，革命初獲成功，他認爲再不能等待，就英勇地當了兵。</p>

<p>出乎意料，他大胆地通過敵人的防綫，由肇慶回到曲江了。據說，將軍聽到曲江吿急時，連夜率隨員十餘人繞道小路，趕返曲江，途經烏石時，距敵人陣地僅數十公尺，幸未討敵哨兵發現，否則，將軍也許沒有今日了。</p>
<p>他趕回曲江，形勢緊張萬分，人心混亂不安，他一面安定民心，一面發動反攻，經三晝夜之血戰，敵人不支潰退，而造成了粵北會戰中的「曲江大捷」戰史中的輝煌之頁。</p>

<p>「我沒有開除你，誰開除你」？</p>
<p>答：「排長。」</p>
<p>將軍立刻把排長叫來，問明原委結果伙伕仍然「復職」。這個伙伕受到意外的關切時時刻刻惦記着張將軍的愛護部下。他總想報答，但幾次送禮，將軍不受，伙伕報答無門，痛哭一塲，哭得連排長也感動了，便代他報吿去。將軍把伙伕叫來，不但不接受他的證品，反送他十幾塊錢。</p>
<p>張氏無嗜好，一度曾嗜酒烟後來又戒絕了。唯一的消遣是喜歡騎馬，每天侵晨，他總要騎一匹好馬到野外去溜溜。這是英雄不離馬的本色。現在他已是五十二歲的老將了，但仍然忙着爲公奔走，最近竹到瓊島去視察治安，對於戰後的安定與建設，他當然仍是極其關心的，正如當年隻身潛赴廣州參加革命的熱誠一樣。</p>

        <h1>1946.09.13</h1>
<h3>Mr. Ma and Ambassador Stuart Tirelessly Seek Ways to Resolve the Current Situation; Yesterday They Met Separately with Song Ziwen and Zhou Enlai, and Today They Will Receive Wu Dingchang and Zhang Lisheng</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] Peace talks continued with contacts on the 12th. Special Envoy Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at 9:45 AM on the 12th to discuss the situation and sticking points of his meetings with Zhou Enlai over the past few days for an hour and a half. Both men maintained their confidence and resolved to continue their efforts for this major mission of peace. Around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, Ambassador Stuart invited Zhou Enlai by phone to meet at the embassy at 4:00 PM. Zhou arrived as scheduled and left at 5:45 PM. It is reported that during the meeting, Zhou believed that the domestic war was expanding daily, and it was currently necessary to obtain a ceasefire guarantee and an immediate ceasefire in action. As for the informal five-person group meeting proposed by Ma and Stuart two weeks ago, it is currently impossible to realize. An authoritative source also said: This matter is also the same as some past events that could not be resolved and were shelved. Although the five-person group meeting was actually a temporary organization that could solve the problem, it had to be classified as a "deferred" item in the "file." This statement is very meaningful. Ambassador Stuart then left the embassy at 6:45 PM to visit Special Envoy Marshall. The reporter conducted a two-minute interview before his departure. The ambassador was in good spirits. The reporter first asked if there were any new developments in the current situation. He replied, "I think there is hope." When asked again whether he intended to find a new path outside of the five-person group meeting, he replied, "I cannot say now." Finally, when asked whether he would first seek a solution in the military aspect and then discuss politics, he replied, "I must meet with Special Envoy Marshall again before I can say." He smiled and nodded, saying that after meeting with Special Envoy Marshall, there might be a solution. He then took a car to Ninghai Road and returned to the embassy half an hour later to host a banquet.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] According to Chuan Jingbo, private advisor to Ambassador Stuart: The news has been relatively quiet in recent days, but I believe that there will be developments in the next two or three days, with big news. When the reporter asked if it was the big news of Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing, Chuan replied that Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing is certainly big news, and some other things may also develop as a result of the Chairman's return to Nanjing. (For Director Wu Dingchang's talk on the overall situation published in Shanghai, please see page two.)</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 11th] Washington Post columnist Belang wrote today that Special Envoy Marshall recently reported to the US government on the mediation of peace in China, saying that it had reached the end. The armed conflict between the Chinese government forces and the Chinese Communist forces aided by Moscow is becoming increasingly tense, and it is difficult to expect any decision in the overall situation for the time being. China will increasingly become a battleground for democratic and communist ideas. President Truman may soon choose whether to continue supporting the formal government of China or to succumb to the opposition, withdraw all aid to the Nationalist government, and allow the Soviet Union to fully support Yan'an.</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai Suggests</p>
<p>Resuming the Three-Person Group Talks</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] After Special Envoy Marshall's meeting with Zhou Enlai, the spokesman for the Communist Party delegation said that Zhou believed that the informal five-person group meeting was unnecessary because it could not solve the problem. The most important thing at present is a ceasefire, so he suggested convening a military three-person group meeting to seek a solution. This suggestion will be conveyed by Special Envoy Marshall to the government representatives. If it is agreed, the military three-person group meeting will be reopened. At 7:30 PM on the 12th, Special Envoy Marshall went to President Song's residence for a long talk, which is believed to be related to this matter. Government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng will also visit Ambassador Stuart again on the 13th. This frequent contact shows that there is a new turn in the current situation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] According to a report by United Press Nanjing on the 11th, "Communist spokesman Wang Bingnan said: Chairman Chiang has rejected the guarantee of a ceasefire order and has put forward a counter-proposal that the Communist Party cannot accept. The counter-proposal and rejection letter have been handed over to Zhou Enlai by Special Envoy Marshall during the Ma-Zhou meeting on the 12th." Regarding this matter, the reporter recently visited relevant parties, who said: There is no such thing. Chairman Chiang did not transfer any documents to Zhou. Fan Changjiang, the spokesman for the Communist Party delegation, also said: No documents were handed over to Zhou.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 12th] The Chinese Communists, having suffered setbacks on the North China battlefield, propose immediately reconvening the military three-person group meeting in an attempt to quickly promote a comprehensive ceasefire. The actions of the Chinese Communists today clearly represent a step back from their original demand for an unconditional ceasefire, and they seem willing to seek a peaceful solution through the three-person group, possibly with conditions attached.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] It is rumored that the Yan'an side has prepared a draft constitution, which will be submitted by the "People's Congress of the Liberated Areas." This draft constitution appeared in the Shanghai-Nanjing area in early September. Relevant parties believe that Yan'an is currently using its so-called "People's Congress" constitution draft for political psychological warfare.</p>
<h3>National Army Continues to Recover Zunhua; Communist Forces in Eastern Hebei Gather in Pinggu and Malanyu; Anti-Communist Work in Southern Hebei Proceeds Smoothly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] The National Army in eastern Hebei recovered Zunhua, the location of the headquarters of the Communist Eastern Hebei Military Region, yesterday. There are also reports of the recovery of Jixian, but this has not been confirmed. It is reported that since the launch of the anti-Communist campaign in eastern Hebei, there have been no encounters with the main force of the Communist army. The longest battle lasted no more than three hours. Li Yunchang's main force is concentrated in the Pinggu and Malanyu areas on the border between Hebei and Jehol. Sun Zhenbang, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Hebei Provincial Government, has gone to Tangshan to cooperate with the military and carry out administrative work.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] The National Army on the north and south lines of the Pingcheng Railway met at Shixia North at 2:00 PM yesterday. The railway repair work will begin immediately from both ends.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] Baoding Telephone. The anti-Communist work in central and southern Hebei is proceeding smoothly. The National Army south of Baoding recovered Tiangezhuang and is now engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army in the Libazhuang area. The National Army has recovered twenty-eight villages and towns. The Communist army is retreating towards Lixian and Boye. In order to prevent and contain the National Army's advance, the local Communist army transferred three regiments and more than 2,000 militiamen from the east last night to launch a fierce attack on Daweicun, forty li southwest of Baoding, for seven hours. The National Army east of Baoding recovered Liujiakou, an important road between Gaoyang and Baoding, on the evening of the 10th, and divided its troops to advance towards Anxin. It has encountered the Communist army at Chashang in the county. The Communist army in Gaoyang city is preparing to withdraw and is transporting materials to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Currently, the anti-Communist work is proceeding smoothly along the Pinghan Railway in Duxian, Xinle, Zhengding, Tangxian, Wanxian, and Dingxing. The National Army in Yuanshi, southern Hebei, has also recovered fifteen strongholds in the northwest. The Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau has prepared materials and is following the National Army south to repair the railway.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] Baoding Telephone. The National Army in Lucheng, southern Hebei, recovered Chenglang Village south of the city last night. Currently, the Communist army in Gaoyi and Luan city area is being transferred to Zhaoxian, and there is a tendency to recapture Zhaoxian.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Communist's So-Called Government Formation Is a Political Trick; American Broadcaster Exposes It with One Word</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington, 11th] Radio commentator Davis said on the American Broadcasting Corporation yesterday: "The Chinese Communist Party is threatening the Chinese government by establishing another 'autonomous government.' This kind of intimidation is not taken seriously, because this kind of intimidation is just another action in the Chinese political game. In Chinese political games, war and propaganda often go hand in hand." Davis said: "In fact, the Chinese Communists already have a government in various parts of North China. This kind of government is in fact autonomous, but in January of this year, the Chinese Communists agreed that once a united government is established, they will place their autonomous government under the control of the new government. Some people are worried about this kind of change, because this kind of autonomous government is said to be established in northern Manchuria on the border with the Soviet Union. If so, then this kind of autonomous government is temporarily nominally an independent country like Outer Mongolia or Bulgaria, and when the time is ripe, it will be merged into the Soviet Federal Republic.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Raiding Kangping Fleeing Towards Tongliao</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Yang, 12th] After being counterattacked by the National Army, the Communist troops that raided Kangping from Tongliao and Liaoyuan have fled back the way they came.</p>
<h3>People in Recovered Areas of Northern Jiangsu Gain True Liberation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency This City] According to visitors from northern Jiangsu: The people in the areas advanced by the National Army have gained the greatest spiritual liberation in two aspects: (1) They can control their own food, and (2) They don't have to attend meetings. Because in the Communist-occupied areas, the common people had to beg the army for food, not the army begging the common people for food. At the same time, regardless of women and children, they had to attend meetings every day. They really had no way to complain, and they couldn't express their suffering. Therefore, once the pressure was relieved, everyone rejoiced endlessly.</p>
<h3>Huang Renlin Flies to Chengde on Behalf of Madam Chiang for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] Chengde News. Chengde has been greatly damaged by the Communist army, and the citizens are in urgent need of relief. Huang Renlin flew from Tianjin to Chengde on the 10th to distribute disaster relief funds on behalf of Madam Chiang. The extremely poor can receive 500 yuan per person. In addition, the Rehe Imperial Villa was also damaged by the Communist army, and the entire courtyard was filled with landmines.</p>
<h3>Chairman Will Descend Lushan Within Days; Nanchang Circles Decide on Welcome Procedures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency This City] According to Wu Dingchang, Director of the Secretariat, who arrived in Shanghai from Guling a few days ago: The Chairman will descend the mountain soon, first to Nanchang, and then return to Nanjing. Except for the Chairman's attendants and secretaries, the staff of the Secretariat in Guling have all returned to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanchang, 11th] The enthusiasm of all circles in Nanchang to welcome the Chairman can be described as unprecedented. It was resolved yesterday: (1) When the Chairman sets off from Guling, a small plane will be dispatched, with a three-colored ribbon of red, blue, and white, one zhang long, tied to the tail, to circle the city three times; (2) Please ask the water and electricity plant to generate electricity earlier from the 11th, and sound a long whistle once when the Chairman sets off from Guling, for a duration of five minutes; (3) Xiong Shihui's mansion on Gongyangming Road has been selected as Chairman Chiang's headquarters. Wang Lingji is scheduled to return to the province from Guling on the 11th. All circles in Jiangxi have appointed elders such as Ouyang Wu to present a banner to the Chairman, and women's representatives will present flowers to Madam Chiang. Furthermore, it is estimated that 100,000 people will participate in the mass rally to welcome the Chairman.</p>
<h3>National and Communist Armies Reinforce Continuously; Jining Will Launch a Decisive Battle; Communist Forces Besieging Datong Are Showing Signs of Wavering</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] A major battle is brewing in Jining, and the outcome will affect the entire situation in the Northwest. The National Army in eastern Suiyuan is fighting fiercely with the Communist army today in the Gaodi west of the Six Rooms and Zhao Jiagou southwest of Jining. On the evening of the 10th, the National Army once rushed into Jining. At 5:00 AM on the 11th, the Communist army reinforced with six or seven thousand troops, and at 10:00 AM reinforced with more than ten thousand troops for the second time. A small number of National Army soldiers who entered the city were forced to withdraw, but the city of Jining is still surrounded by the National Army's infantry and cavalry. It is heard that the air force will participate in the battle starting today, and the National Army's follow-up troops are also heading east one after another. The decisive battle between the National and Communist armies will begin soon. According to another related source, the National Army entered Fengzhen last night and completely recovered it this morning and is advancing towards Datong. The National Army in Jining has cleared the city and is also continuing to advance, but this statement seems to be still unconfirmed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Gui Sui, 12th] Xue Zhenhai, the company commander of the 8th company, 3rd battalion, 2nd regiment, 1st Brigade of the Communist Army, surrendered to the National Army on the outskirts of Jining on the 10th with his entire company of officers and soldiers, with complete weapons.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Gui Sui, 11th] The Communist army is sending a large number of reinforcements to Jining to prevent the National Army from rescuing Datong. It is observed that the battle situation may shift to Jining. Jining is located on the PingSui Railway. It is twelve stations west of Gui Sui and eight stations east of Datong. It is surrounded by mountains on all four sides, and the city is located in a basin. The Iron Army Mountain and Wohu Mountain southeast and northeast of the city are extremely dangerous. After the National Army approached the city of Jining, it occupied the two mountains and the strongholds such as Huangjialiang southwest of the city, which are enough to control the entire city. As of the afternoon of the 11th, the two sides were still in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] The situation in Shanxi is about to change slightly. Outside Yanmen Pass, the area is now under the command of the Twelfth War Zone, Chuan Zuoyi. The military affairs south of the South Korean Houling in Jin are also about to be transferred to Hu Zongnan's command. Hu's army entering Jin will increase from seven divisions to three armies, but Hu has decided not to change any of Yan Xishan's policies in his garrison. Recently, Hu sent a special plane to Taiyuan to welcome Xue Youcheng, an expert in the integration of soldiers and farmers, and Liang Huazhi, the person in charge of the National Revolutionary Comrades Association, to Xi'an to lecture for his cadre training class. Xue Liangdao has now finished lecturing on the integration of soldiers and farmers and other policies and returned to Beijing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Taiyuan, 12th] The Communist army besieging Datong is extremely panicked since the Suiyuan National Army recovered Zhuozishan and advanced to Jining. Although its senior officers have strictly ordered and urged the city to be attacked within a time limit, the lower-level officers and soldiers are mostly timid and unwilling to move forward. The number of people who sneak away and surrender to the National Army is increasing day by day. General observation is that the battle situation in Datong will become more stable.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Taiyuan, 11th] More than a thousand Communist troops窜 from Songjiazhuang, three miles west of Datong, destroyed the blockhouse outside the West Gate on the night of the 9th. Three thousand Communist troops in Baishou City and Wohu Bay, north of the city, have been strengthening their fortifications for days. On the night of the 9th, the Communist army built fortifications near the airport south of the city and were suppressed by the National Army's firepower and fled. Small groups of Communist troops harassed the east and west sides of the city and the station north of the city at the same time and continued to shell and attack the city. The Communist army southwest of the city has retreated to the Zhoujiadian and Qilicun areas.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 12th] Government forces continued to advance towards Zhangjiakou today, occupying Jining on the west road and passing Kangzhuang on the south road. According to a broadcast by Yan'an Radio, the Eighth Route Army has occupied Xiaoyi, 300 li southwest of Taiyuan, in central Shanxi. According to a report from Datong, the troops guarding the airport have retreated into the city to strengthen defenses. The Communist infantry and artillery teams continued to attack the city, with one group attempting to climb the city wall from the South Gate, but they were repelled after two hours of fierce fighting.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army's Use of Poison Gas in Datong Cannot Be Concealed by Sophistry</h3>
<p>The Shanxi Command Headquarters Refutes Yan'an Broadcast</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Taiyuan, 12th] On the 10th, Yan'an Radio's Xinhua News Agency denied that the Communist army in Datong had used poison gas. A spokesman for the Second War Zone Command recently issued a statement stating: Yan'an's broadcast is purely an attempt to deceive oneself and others in order to achieve its goal of launching a civil war. The Communist army used poison gas in the Datong campaign. General Commander Chu Xichun reported in a telegram on September 8th that on September 123, the Communist army fired more than 200 tear-inducing and sneezing poison gas shells at the station and Yan Yue Temple. 342 officers and soldiers of the National Army and 67 civilians were poisoned. The above facts are on record. How can the Communist Party's sophistry conceal it? It only shows that its crimes are an attempt to cover up its guilt.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Regarding the Position of Chairman of the National Congress Preparatory Committee, He Has Resigned to the Chairman in Guling</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Participation Council, and his wife took a military plane to Shanghai at 10:00 PM on the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] Shao Lizi told people on the 12th that he has been feeling tired recently due to heavy workload. He finds it difficult to concurrently serve as the Chairman of the National Congress Preparatory Committee and has personally presented his resignation to the Chairman in Guling.</p>
<h3>Li Jishen and Chiang Dingwen Arrive in Hangzhou This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 12th] General Li Jishen, along with Xiang Songpo and Yu Jin, came to Hangzhou this afternoon to discuss how to promote production and revitalize industry, and to actively develop the work of the China Production Promotion Association in Hangzhou. In addition, Chiang Dingwen also arrived this afternoon. It is said that he came here after raising 15 million yuan in funds and 2,000 mu of fertile land to revitalize his hometown of Zhuji.</p>
<h3>Details of Salary Increase for Military Personnel Still to be Negotiated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] The principle has been decided regarding the salary increase for military personnel, but some details are still to be discussed by relevant agencies.</p>
<h3>US Military Command in Shanghai Merged into Nanjing Headquarters</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 12th] The US Department of the Army announced today that the US Army Service Command in Shanghai will be merged into the US Army Headquarters in Nanjing on September 30th. This change is another step in the reorganization of the US military in China, which began in July. It is expected that the US military will still retain a small warehouse in Shanghai. The US military in China is currently commanded by Lieutenant General Gillon, while Major General Rooks is the head of the US Military Advisory Group in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Major General Howard Arrives in Tianjin to Take Office as Commander of US Marine Corps in China</h3>

<h3>Our Financial Situation is Optimistic; Revenue Has Exceeded Expenditure Since June</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] According to sources, the government's current financial revenue and expenditure situation is very optimistic. The total revenue in June accounted for 60% of the total expenditure, the total revenue in July accounted for 40%, and the total revenue in August accounted for 52%. Therefore, there has been no increase in issuance in recent months. Compared with the wartime government's revenue accounting for only 19% of the total, it is a great improvement. According to the reason for the sharp increase in the percentage of fiscal revenue, in addition to the profits of state-owned enterprises such as the China Textile Corporation and the income from the sale of enemy and puppet materials, there are also various relief materials and the transfer of US military materials in China. This huge input is extremely important to our country's balance of payments. It is reported that the government's total expenditure in August was approximately 400 billion.</p>

<p>Declaration in Full</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 12th] The Declaration of the Second National Congress of the Three Principles of the People Youth Corps is as follows:</p>
<p>Our Corps was born in Wuchang, the site of the first uprising of the Xinhai Revolution, on March 9, 1938. Subsequently, on March 29, 1943, the anniversary of the Huanghuagang Martyrs, the First National Congress was convened in Chongqing, the wartime capital. Now, on September 1 of this year, the Second National Congress is convened in Lushan, the sacred site where the national policy of 抗战 (Resistance War) was determined. Looking back from its birth to the present, eight years have passed. During these eight years, our country and our nation have truly been at a critical juncture of life and death. With the great inspiration of the Three Principles of the People and the wise leadership of our President, the comrades of our Corps have gloriously participated in the sacred work of the Resistance War. After a long and arduous struggle, we have finally achieved the final victory. We have always regarded safeguarding the country, revitalizing the nation, and realizing the Three Principles of the People as our mission. The number of Corps members has increased to over 1.4 million during this Resistance War, making our Corps the greatest youth organization in our country's history. This makes us even more convinced that our efforts are not in vain, and that the future of the Republic of China will inevitably achieve the goals of equality, freedom, prosperity, strength, and well-being through our continued efforts. We have not lived in vain in this great era, and we must fulfill the mission entrusted to us by this great era. Now, on the closing day of this Congress, we wish to make a frank statement of our views to our compatriots throughout the country and to the youth throughout the country. (1) First of all, we must point out to the youth of our country that the Chinese National Revolution has today entered the darkest and most difficult period before reaching its ultimate success. The unity of the country is threatened by destruction, and the fate of the nation is on the verge of a crisis of weakness. However, our confidence in the revolution should become stronger and stronger, and our efforts to build the country must be redoubled. We firmly believe that with the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father as our guide, the brightness of the future will be even more apparent in this darkness. We firmly believe that with our Corps Leader leading us to work hard for the National Revolution, we will definitely be able to safeguard the unity of the country and complete the mission of building the country. Therefore, we are absolutely optimistic about the future of the revolution, and there is no doubt that the building of the country will be successful. What we are saddened and grieved about today is that at this critical moment of national survival, society lacks a sense of right and wrong, people's hearts are turning to decadence, and even good and evil are reversed, and right and wrong are indistinguishable. The nation's inherent morality has been swept away, and the responsibilities that citizens should have are disregarded. All of these are enough to plunge the country and the nation into chaos and ruin, and are definitely not what should be present during the period of national revival and construction. We, the youth, living in this turbulent and shocking era, must identify our goals, distinguish between right and wrong, correct our direction, and be determined to be the pillars of the country and to save the nation from the brink of collapse, so as to fulfill the responsibilities that our generation should have to the country and the nation. The rise and fall, governance and chaos of the country, and the success or failure, honor or disgrace of the revolution are most closely related to us, the youth, and we, the youth, bear the greatest responsibility. We must not follow others blindly, drift with the tide, or stand by idly and abandon our natural duties. Otherwise, the future generations of the Chinese nation will be reduced to slaves of foreign races, and we, the youth of today, will become sinners for all eternity. In order to understand our responsibilities and missions, we should conduct a serious review of the current international and domestic situation. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<h3>Chief Secretary Wu Discusses the Overall Situation; The Government Sincerely Hopes for the Realization of the Five-Person Talks; Zhang Qun's Trip to the United States is Purely for Treating a Malignant Tumor</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Mr. Wu Dingchang, Chief Secretary of the National Government, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Guling on the afternoon of the 9th. Yesterday, reporters specially visited his residence to inquire about his observations on the Five-Person Group Talks. Mr. Wu said: The Five-Person Group was proposed by Special Envoy Marshall, who clearly stated that it was only to discuss the reorganization of the National Government and did not attach any preconditions. After the government is reorganized, other issues will naturally be easily resolved. Therefore, the government expressed its approval. The two conditions recently proposed by the Chinese Communist Party were not known to the government before Special Envoy Marshall went to Lushan seven times. The only expectation of the government at present is that the Five-Person Talks will be realized as soon as possible and achieve complete success. As for the issue of ceasefire, it should be continued to be discussed by the Three-Person Group. Mr. Wu also stated: The government has long had the sincerity to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Chairman Chiang has already explained this in the August 14th 文吿 (Public Statement). The reorganization of the government is only a part of the implementation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions. When reporters inquired about whether there was any agreement on the restoration of transportation, Mr. Wu replied: On June 30, both parties reached an agreement on the full restoration of transportation and the withdrawal of the Chinese Communist Party from the Northeast region. However, because the Chinese Communist Party insisted on other conditions, it was not signed. Mr. Wu believes that the overall situation will definitely not be prolonged for long, and there is hope for the realization of peace.</p>
<p>Regarding the trip of Sichuan Chairman Zhang Yuejun to the United States, it is indeed for medical treatment. Two years ago, a small lump appeared behind his ear. Due to busy official duties, he had not had it removed. Recently, on the advice of Doctor Dong Bingqi, he underwent surgery. The situation is good, and the wound is gradually healing. However, after Doctor Dong examined the removed object, he believed that it was a malignant tumor and must be examined for the root cause with deep X-rays as soon as possible. Otherwise, it may become a major problem. There are only two such instruments in our country, one in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Shanghai, which has long been abandoned, and one in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beiping. After an electric inquiry, it was found that it was also unusable. Therefore, it was decided to go to the United States for treatment. This news was initially learned by a reporter from the Central News Agency from Doctor Dong. It was transmitted to the capital, and then Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng telegraphed the information to me. I immediately reported it to the Chairman, who initially did not believe it. It was not until the 7th of this month that Zhang sent a telegram to Guling, asking the Chairman for a three-month leave, that it was confirmed. Because the Chairman considered that his illness was relatively serious, he approved the leave and immediately appointed General Deng Xihou to act as the Chairman of Sichuan Province to facilitate his trip. On the 8th, he received a notice from Special Envoy Marshall that he had arranged a seat on a military plane departing on the 10th, and he could depart immediately. I immediately informed Zhang and urged him to find a way to come to Shanghai on the 9th. I also came down the mountain on the 9th. At that time, the Chairman instructed me to take a letter to Zhang. I immediately came to Shanghai from Guling. The Chairman's letter to Zhang only contained a few words, hoping that he would return to the country immediately after his health recovered. As for the various rumors from the outside world, they are absolutely not true.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Work of the UNRRA Jiangxi Branch</h3>
<p>Branch Director Reports to Press Corps</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 11th] The Jinghu-Han Press Corps visiting Nanchang attended a press conference of the UNRRA Jiangxi Branch this morning after visiting various organs of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, Provincial Party Headquarters, and Municipal Government. Deputy Branch Director Huang Guangdou briefly reported on the general disasters caused by the war in various counties of Jiangxi Province, and then briefly described the branch's business, from passive relief to actively taking post-disaster measures. He also said that the branch had approximately 40,000 buildings in Nanchang before the war, and approximately 30,000 were bombed and burned during the war, so most of the refugees returning to the province had nowhere to live. The branch has now established ten civilian villages and two nurseries. The branch's countermeasure for relieving the disaster-stricken rural areas is that Jiangxi's heavily disaster-stricken villages, such as many villages under the jurisdiction of De'an County on the Nanshun Road, are not only deserted, with no cattle left, but also the houses that farmers must have are mostly in ruins. Farmers have nowhere to live, and the rural workforce will never be able to recover. Therefore, the branch plans to start by building new farmhouses and imitating new farm tools, hoping to address the actual needs of rural disaster areas in Jiangxi, implement post-disaster policies, and seek revival. After Mr. Huang finished speaking, the reporters asked some questions and agreed to visit the civilian villages sponsored by the branch and visit the Jiangxi refugees at a selected time.</p>

Therefore, people from all walks of life have risen up to demand that it be verified and reduced. The provincial government, in order to consider the people's difficulties and take into account the government's finances, decided at today's provincial government meeting to prepare to form the Zhejiang Provincial Land Tax Committee.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Key to Governance Lies in Implementation!</h3>
<p>The Supreme National Defense Council held a regular meeting in the capital the day before yesterday and passed the government's administrative guidelines for the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), of which the three most important are: (1) Implementing constitutional government and promoting democratic politics; (2) Reorganizing the military and ensuring the nationalization of the army; (3) Reforming agricultural land, revitalizing the countryside, and improving the lives of farmers.</p>
<p>Although the above three guidelines are clichés that are well-known and not novel, observing the domestic political situation, what the general public hopes from the government, and what China's politics urgently needs to reform, are nothing more than these three principles. Governance does not require many words; as long as the government can be down-to-earth, sincerely work towards it, and strive for its realization, rather than treating it as mere lip service, then the future of Chinese politics can unfold a bright future.</p>
<p>First, our country is promoting democratic politics. This is not only to adapt to the world trend and to live up to the expectations of friendly countries, but also because the whole country believes that the only way out for Chinese politics is rapid democratization. Because the current political ills lie primarily in the lack of administrative efficiency, the increase in redundant personnel while business declines, and the abundance of discussions with few successes. Secondly, the wind of corruption is deeply entrenched, and the punishment of corruption often starts with great fanfare but ends weakly, with much thunder and little rain. How to improve administrative efficiency? How to cultivate a clean and honest political atmosphere? Only the sincere implementation of democratic politics is the right remedy. Because the above two major abuses are all symptoms of bureaucratic politics, only by allowing the people to directly participate in politics can the abuse of private interests be eliminated, and the chronic diseases of deception and fraud be eradicated. Democratic politics must be from the bottom up, so the most important thing is to establish local public opinion organs in all provinces, cities, and counties as much as possible, and effectively supervise the government. As for the implementation of constitutional government, first, there must be a constitution as a norm for the whole country to abide by, so the issue of the draft constitution should be resolved as soon as possible, and the National Assembly, which is responsible for drafting the constitution, should not be postponed again, since the government has scheduled it to be held on November 12th.</p>
<p>Second, the nationalization of the army is not only urgently needed to ensure national unity and peace, but also for the future of national rejuvenation, it should be promoted as soon as possible. In any democratic country, there is no political party that owns an army, let alone uses force as a tool for political struggle; otherwise, civil war cannot be avoided. The reason why there is a Communist Party border region government in China that is divided and self-reliant is because the Communist Party has its own army, believes in force, and feels that it has nothing to fear, so it can do whatever it wants. Therefore, if the nationalization of the army cannot be realized one day, there will be no guarantee of domestic peace for one day. At the same time, China has undergone eight years of arduous war of resistance, and the material sacrifices and losses can hardly be quantified. After the war, after painful reflection, the army should be reorganized as soon as possible to reduce the country's expenses and concentrate our human and material resources on the great cause of national construction and rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Third, when it comes to revitalizing the countryside, 80% of the Chinese people are farmers. During this war of resistance, they supported the government's national policy of resistance with their vast human and material resources, making the greatest contribution. However, in the technology of agricultural production, they stick to old ways and stand still, so the output has not only not increased, but has gradually decreased. Coupled with natural and man-made disasters, the entire rural society has reached the brink of bankruptcy. Therefore, no one can deny that the focus of national construction and rejuvenation is to revitalize the countryside and improve the lives of the general poor farmers. In addition to cooperating with the United States to improve production technology, we must also consider the environment of rural society, not only must politics be clean and bright, order must be stable, and taxes must be reduced, but also we must quickly plan to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and promote the land reform policy, so that the general farmers can own their own land and live and work in peace and contentment.</p>
<p>In short, the government's administrative guidelines are correct, and they are not too lofty, but the biggest problem is whether the government has made a great determination to realize the guidelines it has set.</p>
<p>Friendship and Commerce Between China and Britain</p>
<p>The British Goodwill Commercial Delegation, led by Sir Poes, has departed from London for China. Zheng Tianxi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, hosted a farewell banquet in London and gave a speech at the banquet, expressing that the Chinese people have high expectations for the British business community and welcome the delegation to China. He also said that the Chinese market has unlimited potential, and the mutual trust and friendship between the people of China and Britain for centuries cannot be calculated with money. Sir Poes also made a reply speech at the banquet, saying that the purpose of the delegation is to promote friendship and commercial relations between the two countries. It is estimated that the British delegation will arrive in China at the end of this month, and a new page in the relationship between China and Britain will be opened, and trade between the two countries is expected to increase significantly. At the same time, British Ambassador Sir Steven also came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. When he met with people from all walks of life in Shanghai for the first time, he expressed that Britain is willing to assist China in construction and rejuvenation in science, technology, and industry, which shows Ambassador Steven's enthusiasm for China.</p>
<p>The relationship between China and Britain has always been close, and it can be said that it has become a friendship in adversity after this war. The friendship between the two countries should be further consolidated after the baptism of blood. Especially after the war, the Labor Party took over the government after the Conservative Party, and adopted enlightened policies both internally and externally. In today's Britain, both the government and the public are hoping that China can become a strong, unified, and democratic country. Before Ambassador Steven was ordered to come to China, he had already stated: "Britain has no other ambitions in China other than commerce. The British government will do its best to assist China within the greatest possible range to ensure that China becomes a large and unified country." What Britain hopes from China is like this, and what China expects Britain to assist is also only this. Since the opinions of both parties can be the same and mutually understood, it will be easier. Therefore, the future of the relationship between China and Britain has unlimited hope.</p>
<p>All the representatives of the British delegation are magnates in the British business community, and Britain is a modern country that pays attention to industry and commerce, so their words and deeds can not only represent the British business community, but also represent its government. We hope that after the British delegation comes to China, they will conduct on-the-ground investigations and research, and draw up concrete plans for the British government to refer to in order to determine its trade policy towards China, so that it can assist China in construction and rejuvenation with capital and technology as soon as possible, so that both China and Britain can benefit from it.</p>
<p>Investigation and Taxation</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper briefly discussed what the future direction of the Municipal Council should be. It is reported that today's Municipal Council will again discuss whether to participate in the work of the investigation team. Among the various review committees yesterday, the most noteworthy was the municipal budget proposal for the second half of the year and the five proposals on taxation submitted by the municipal government. In general, what the general public is most concerned about at this time is nothing more than two points: (1) Since the Council represents the citizens, and what the citizens have been most dissatisfied with over the years is the "takeover" work, is the Council willing, and does it dare to take responsibility for the investigation? (2) Since the municipal government has no other proposals besides raising taxes, is the Council just acting as a representative for the citizens to approve tax increases?</p>
<p>Let us now briefly describe our humble opinions on these two issues.</p>
<p>First, if there is a problem with the takeover work, the responsibility for the problem lies with the takeover agency, and the takeover agency is government personnel. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with having a public opinion organ conduct an investigation, and it should even be said that it is necessary. It is heard that Team Leader Zhang Zhiben has stated that the investigation work in Shanghai is heavy, and welcomes the Municipal Council to recommend two or three more people to participate, and the investigation time can also be extended as appropriate. In our opinion, the Municipal Council seems unable to refuse again. If it is believed that the participation of a few people is not enough, the Municipal Council can also organize an investigation committee at the same time (the Council Regulations have provisions for establishing various committees) to specialize in investigating all takeover work within the scope of Shanghai in the past year as a backup for the central investigation team. Of course, we may not be able to expect that with the investigation by the Municipal Council, everything can be investigated clearly without any omissions, but the councilors at least claim to come from the people, and if they can conduct careful investigations, there will always be some benefits. If it is ridiculed that the work is not easy to do and it is pushed away, it will be unreasonable.</p>
<p>Second, the municipal government convened a Municipal Council with great solemnity, but the five proposals submitted were only for taxes: (1) Property tax, increase by one to two times to four times in the autumn according to the summer, and each increase by one time in the winter according to the autumn; (2) Municipal tax, also collected according to the current value of the house, from 2/1000 to 3/1000, divided into different grades; (3) Sanitation tax, also collected according to the property tax method, divided into different grades; (4) Municipal tax attached to public utilities, each attached at 10% of the monthly water, electricity, gas, telephone, etc. fees; (5) Restore horse racing and collect taxes. The first four items are expected to increase revenue by 45 billion yuan this year. It is heard that the total budget expenditure of the municipal government for the second half of the year is more than 80 billion yuan, which shows that half of it will rely on these newly added taxes to make up for it. We want to ask the Municipal Council a few questions first: (1) In this meeting, what kind of municipal administration do you want the municipal government to do? (2) What major issues do you plan to discuss besides taxes? (3) Does the municipal government have to report to you first before increasing these taxes on how many roads and bridges will be repaired? How many tons of garbage will be cleaned up? How many drainage pipes will be added? How many more schools will be run? How many more policemen and sanitation workers will be set up? In other words, has a work plan been issued and explained first? (4) The meaning of property tax is originally municipal tax, not housing rental income tax. Now, in addition to property tax, there is also a municipal tax, a sanitation tax, a municipal tax attached to public utilities, etc., which really gives people a sense of "creating names." The municipal government just wants to raise funds anyway. It would be straightforward to have a "one-line whip" and simply collect as much as you want. Why bother with so many taxes and make people unhappy? Otherwise, if sanitation requires a tax, will education require another tax in the future? If public utilities require a tax, will public works require another tax in the future? Police... will they not require even more taxes? In short, if citizens want to run the municipal administration well, they naturally have to pay taxes, and they have to pay full taxes. The municipal councilors are originally representatives of taxpayers, and discussing taxation is also their unshirkable responsibility, but in any case, we must first know the purpose of taxation, and then we must require that the taxes be simple and not involve harshness!</p>

<h3>UN Secretariat Formally Announces General Assembly Postponed to Meet for One Month  Britain and Soviet Union Quarrel in Security Council  Greek-Albanian Border Dispute to be Submitted for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 12th Urgent Broadcast: According to news from Lake Success, New York: The United Nations Secretariat announced that the United Nations General Assembly has been officially postponed to October 23rd of this year.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Washington, 11th Broadcast: News from Lake Success, New York: The French representative came up with a compromise, advocating a "fair investigation" of the Greek-Albanian border incident. It is believed that this move will bring an end to the debate in the Security Council. The United States believes that the border conflict involves international relations and is prepared to support the French proposal.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] At a meeting of the United Nations Security Council today, Soviet Representative Gromyko and British Representative Jebb once again had a quarrel over the issue of "insulting the Red Army," and finally adjourned the meeting until the 13th. Gromyko firmly opposed the withdrawal of Ukraine's accusations against Britain and Greece. Jebb refuted this, saying that Ukraine openly accused the British army of interfering in Greece. If I accused the Red Army of the same crime, what would the representatives of Ukraine and the Soviet Union think? Gromyko then pointed out that this was an insult to the Red Army. Jebb then re-read the words to prove that they could not be withdrawn.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] The Soviet Union asked the Security Council to investigate how many troops of the United Nations members are currently stationed outside their great power territories. The United States intends to question the purpose of this move. The Soviet Union's request applies to all territories other than former enemy countries, so according to the Soviet plan, Soviet troops stationed in Hungary and Romania do not need to submit reports. It is expected that this entire issue will be raised in the Security Council soon. US officials believe that the Soviet proposal is intended to put the United States in an embarrassing situation because of its troops stationed in Iceland, etc., and the United Kingdom because of its troops stationed in Greece.</p>
<h3>For the Slavic Group at the Peace Conference, the United States Suddenly Launches a Double Counterattack, Declares Abandonment of Reparation Claims Against Italy, and Demands Disarming of Bulgaria's Southern Border</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 11th] The Slavic group attacked Italy and Greece as barriers to the Mediterranean at the peace conference. The United States today suddenly launched a double counterattack, asking the peace conference to at least disarm Bulgaria on the Greek border and pay attention to US aid to Italy, so that it should not be used as reparations for other countries. This statement was made by Jefferson Caffery, the US Ambassador to France, and Sober, an economic expert from the State Department, respectively in the Political and Territorial Committee on the Treaty with Bulgaria and the Economic Committee on the Treaty with Italy. Sober announced that the United States is willing to cancel any compensation claims against Italy for its direct losses of about 20 billion yuan in the two battles in the Mediterranean. The total direct war expenses of the United States are no less than 355 billion yuan, which is equal to the entire national wealth of the United States before the war, but the US government does not want other countries to cancel their compensation claims uniformly. India, Canada, Australia, South Africa and other countries have also abandoned their compensation claims against Italy.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Representatives Hold Fair Views - Former Enemies, Tomorrow's Friends - Claiming Compensation Should Be Based on National Strength</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 11th Special Telegram] Our country's representative, Yu Ji, declared in the Italian Economic Committee this afternoon that although Italy had obtained huge reparations from our country after the so-called Boxer Rebellion in 1900, our country is unwilling to claim compensation for this war from Italy. The issue of compensation for our country's losses in the war against Italy will be resolved through negotiations between China and Italy. Yu made a general review of the issue of compensation and appealed to all countries claiming compensation not to make demands that exceed the real and decisive interests of the country being claimed from. Demands that can be met are better than demands that cannot be realized. Yu also asked the representatives of the countries in the Italian Economic Committee to guide their work with a spirit of goodwill, because today's enemy country is tomorrow's friendly country, so it is worthwhile to cultivate their goodwill. Yu concluded by saying that if excessive compensation is claimed from the conquered, it will cause their collapse, which is not the way to world peace. We must have a long-term vision to win peace.</p>
<h3>Italy Demands Relaxation of Land and Naval Limits</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] The Peace Conference Military Committee held a meeting today, chaired by Fu Bingchang, the Chinese representative. Italian representative Gorati immediately proposed that the restrictions on the strength of the Italian army and navy in the treaty should be relaxed so that Italy could become an important factor in maintaining peace and security in the Mediterranean. Gorati advocated raising the army limit from 22,500 personnel to 35,000 personnel.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 12th Broadcast: The Military Committee has agreed that the Italian navy may have 46 ships, totaling 67,500 tons. Today, the Italian delegation requested to maintain 121 naval ships, and stated that Italy needs at least 100,000 tons of warships, but for the sake of compromise, it is willing to maintain 80,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Wants to Negotiate Directly with Italy to Resolve the Border Issue Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th] Yugoslavia seems to want to negotiate directly with Italy to resolve the issue of Trieste and determine the Italian-Yugoslav border. Yugoslavia is exploring whether Italy is willing to establish a condominium-style government in Trieste, so that the area is not directly managed by United Nations agencies. Yugoslavia will then guarantee that Italian residents in Fiume and Gorizia will have some autonomy, and the Pola area will belong to Italy.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris, 11th Broadcast: The Economic Committee of the Peace Conference with Italy passed a proposal by the Czech representative to establish a subcommittee to study the Italian-Yugoslav border issue by a vote of eleven to nine.</p>

<h3>Greek King Issues Declaration Determined to Defend National Rights Greek Political Stability is a Factor for Peace</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th] On the eve of his return to the country, Greek King George II issued a public notice here, explaining his determination to safeguard the rights of the great powers. He briefly stated, "International disputes have dragged Greece into a whirlpool of huge disputes. The unification of Greece is not only a matter of political and economic welfare, but also a matter of self-preservation. The peace of Greece depends on this, and by extension, the peace of the world also depends on this. The unification of the country is based on the fundamental principles of Greek civilization and Christian civilization. This civilization has always protected Greece since ancient times, and in the future, it should disarm our country's enemies again and allow us to ensure independence in every aspect. The independence of our country's national policy cannot be obtained by words alone, but only by the stability of our political life. I will do my best to serve the people for this proposition." He has been in exile in London for five years, and this is his first public declaration after the Greek referendum.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 11th] The Greek Ministry of Security revealed today that since the referendum on September 1, 83 people have died in conflicts in various parts of Greece, with more casualties on the "bandit side."

<h3>Eisenhower Mourns the Death of His Mother and Returns to His Hometown to Attend the Funeral</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 11th] US Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower, together with British Imperial Chief of Staff Montgomery, had just entered the Army Department building today when they suddenly received a call from Eisenhower's home in Abilene, Kansas, saying that his mother had passed away this morning. Eisenhower was grief-stricken when he received the news and immediately decided not to attend the banquet to entertain Montgomery tonight and decided to take a train tonight to return to his hometown to attend the funeral.</p>
<h3>British Chief of Staff Arrives in the United States for Consultation to Unify National Defense Control and Study US Military Training for Reference</h3>
<p>[US News Service, Washington, 11th] British Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery, at the invitation of Eisenhower, arrived in the United States for a visit and paid a visit to President Truman at the White House today.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] British Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery recently declared at a press conference that the British government is considering reorganizing British national defense in accordance with US methods. The British and American armies have worked closely together in wartime and cooperated closely. Once a conflict occurs again, the unification of the two countries' armies is sincerely desired by both sides. As for whether ground warfare will become impossible due to the atomic bomb, it cannot be proved at present. The main purpose of my visit to the United States is to study the training methods adopted by US military schools so that the British Army can have a system for rapidly training officers and soldiers after returning home. Speaking of the Soviet Red Army, fighting on the European battlefield is "not to be underestimated." At that time, the Allied forces attacked from the east and west, with the west led by Eisenhower and the east led by Marshal Stalin. When the two armies met, the Allied countries won the victory. It is rumored that I had disagreements with Eisenhower during the war, which is absolutely not true. In addition, it is learned that Montgomery plans to travel to Australia, New Zealand, and other British territories in the Pacific next year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th United Press] British Imperial Chief of Staff Montgomery arrived in the United States and conducted important military consultations with Eisenhower and staff members. He suggested that British and American military plans and equipment should be linked, the organization of each division and corps should be completely consistent, and they should have the same staff organization. Various supplies such as ammunition for tanks and mortars, as well as the caliber of artillery, should be consistent so that either side can use the other's equipment, and soldiers should receive completely comparable training for emergency use.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] Field Marshal Montgomery laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington Cemetery today. When Montgomery's car turned right into the tomb, 17 gun salutes were fired and the band played British and American national anthems. 200 soldiers stood at attention and saluted. Montgomery then drove to the Army Department to address US officers who were under his command during the war.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 12th] Australian Minister to China, Copland, declared here today that the Australian government will submit a draft agreement to the next United Nations General Assembly to place New Guinea, which is under Australian mandate, under the United Nations trusteeship system.</p>
<h3>The Jewish Question is of Global Significance; Zionist Organizations Arm Themselves; Arabs Claim They Will Adopt Self-Defense Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 11th] The Arab representative stated frankly at the London conference today that he opposes the political status of Jews in Palestine. If unrest occurs again in Palestine, it will cause conflict between Zionists and Arabs. Syrian representative Curry said that the only solution acceptable to the Arabs is to allow Palestine to be independent, in accordance with the democratic principle that favors the Arab majority. Furthermore, no part of it can be cut off for the residence of immigrant groups that share the same religion but not the same ethnicity. The Jewish question is of global concern and therefore requires a global solution. Zionist organizations are arming themselves and implementing terrorism. If British troops cannot stop the unrest, they will force the Arabs to adopt self-defense methods to protect themselves.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] The communiqué of the Palestine conference stated that Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech mentioning the international nature of the Palestine issue and asked the conference to adopt a broad perspective. Secretary-General of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha, expressed the same opinion. Finally, Hall of the Colonial Office analyzed Britain's partition plan for Palestine.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 11th] The Palestinian Arab Higher Committee met today to discuss the report of the London conference for approximately two hours. The decision to postpone the meeting of executive committee members in Alexandria, convened by Chairman Husseini, the Grand Mufti, has been made.</p>
<h3>US Sailors Call for a National General Strike</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] US sailors are implementing a national general strike, and the Industrial Organizations Seafarers Union has also announced a strike for tomorrow. However, the Wage Stabilization Board today still refused to change its rejection of sailors' wage increases, maintaining the decision made last month by a vote of four to two, with only the two labor commissioners expressing opposition. This sudden wave of strikes has clearly attracted the attention of the White House, and it is expected that President Truman will propose a plan to handle the labor unrest.</p>
<h3>Remains of US Pilots Returned from the South for Burial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: An American plane was shot down by Yugoslavian fighter jets over Yugoslavia on August 19, resulting in the deaths of five American pilots. Today, the remains of these five pilots were transported by an army transport plane to Washington, where they were buried in Arlington Cemetery with the utmost honor.</p>
<h3>Japanese Businessman Makes Shocking Suggestion: Emperor Hirohito Should Personally Go to the Four Allied Nations to Apologize</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Mr. Takagi, a Japanese vitamin manufacturer, today made a shocking suggestion, advocating that Emperor Hirohito be allowed to fly to the four nations of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China to apologize to President Truman, Prime Minister Attlee, Marshal Stalin, and Chairman Chiang. Once Hirohito returns to Japan, he should be forced to abdicate. According to Takagi's statement to a "Stars and Stripes" reporter, he first conceived of this plan last October and immediately wrote to Prince Higashikuni and Prince Kuni, but Higashikuni ignored him, while Kuni supported Hirohito's visit to the United States. Takagi later wrote an article in the August issue of "News" magazine and distributed 1,000 copies, saying that 800 people who read the proposal expressed their support. Japan's apology to the United States should not be delayed for too long. However, Takagi does not consider the Emperor to be a war criminal, but only recognizes him as the "father" of all Japanese war criminals on trial and responsible for their actions. According to officials at MacArthur's headquarters, Takagi has not yet submitted his plan to MacArthur.</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in Eastern Australia; Rarest in a Century; Disaster Area Covers 500,000 Square Miles</h3>

This will be the largest US fleet to enter Tokyo Bay since Japan's surrender, consisting of two aircraft carriers, three cruisers, and nine destroyers. This is a routine cruise exercise, first visiting Shanghai and Qingdao, then coming here, and is scheduled to return to Guam on November 6th.</p>
<h3>Huge State-Owned Enterprise Success Secret: American Grassroots System (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Sent by Our Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>The second characteristic of the grassroots system is to strive for development as much as possible.</p>
<p>Unlimited development. The TVA's organization is now more than ten times larger than it was in 1933. Their intention is to expand even further, like the roots of wild grass, extending deep into the soil. However, although they each extend individually, the life of the grass itself is only one. Therefore, there is a division of labor within their connections, and there are also connections within the division of labor. Using the names of Chinese government offices to translate, the Tennessee Valley Authority now has three divisions, nine sections, eight offices, and two departments. At the top is the Board of Directors, and below the Board of Directors is the General Manager. The General Manager has three main divisions: the Power Division, the Water Resources Division, and the Agricultural Land Division. The Power Division has three sections: the Engineering and Construction Section, the Power Management Section, and the Power Usage Section. The Water Resources Division also has three sections: the Design Section, the Construction Section, and the Water Flow Control Section. The Agricultural Land Division also has three sections: the Crop Section, the Forest Section, and the Chemical Engineering Section. In addition, there are eight offices and two departments that report directly to the General Manager: the Personnel Office, the Local Situation Investigation Office, the Property Supply Office, the Local Situation Investigation Office, the Medical Office, the Commercial Office, and the Storage and Management Office. The two departments are the Budget Department and the Information Department. The Information Department includes library materials, film photography, and other reception and publication matters. Such a state-owned enterprise</p>
<p>Such a large organization as a state-owned enterprise like this is easy to divide labor, but difficult to connect. Before the "grassroots system" was implemented, the system of layered responsibility was not implemented. At that time, there was no general manager yet. Therefore, President Roosevelt only appointed a three-person committee (i.e., the later Board of Directors), whose powers and responsibilities were extremely unclear. The Board of Directors had no leader, and the expertise and insights of the three people were different. For example, one of the directors, Morgan, was the president of the University of Tennessee, with a background in entomology. His focus was only on agriculture, not on other aspects. Lilienthal, with a background in law, focused only on the system, organization, and social reaction. As a result, they could not coordinate with each other, and progress was very slow. Five years after the establishment of the TAA, in 1938, Roosevelt decided to implement a system of centralized power for the chairman of the board, but the effectiveness was still limited. Morgan was 71 years old when he became chairman of the board in 1938. It was impossible for such a large enterprise to be fully borne by a 71-year-old man, so the general manager system was later adopted. It was not until Lilienthal became chairman that the entire "grassroots system" of the TAA was established and entered the right track of the administrative system. Here, I should introduce the TVA's</p>
<p>The background and career of the three former and current directors. The first person I should mention is Lilienthal. This young entrepreneur is now the mainstay of the Tennessee Valley Authority. When the TVA was established, Roosevelt sent him to serve as a director. At that time, he was only 33 years old. He is from Illinois and studied in Indiana when he was young. He studied law at Harvard University and did not graduate until 1923. Lilienthal does not have a beautiful resume. If there is one, it is his contribution to the TVA. Since Roosevelt entrusted him with this important mission, this young talent has been working tirelessly in Tennessee. In his book "Democracy on the March," published in 1944, he said, "The TVA has no power, nor does it ever want the power to force farmers to work, to force merchants and landlords to do any work. If it is said that today everyone believes that the TVA has achieved considerable success, then this success should be attributed to the automatic power of the people, to the volunteerism, enthusiasm, and cooperation of democracy." Lilienthal is one who knows how to inspire the enthusiasm of the people and is also one who is good at using the enthusiasm of the people. World War</p>
<p>After the victory, Lilienthal was hired by the State Department to serve as an advisor on atomic energy, but his interest remained in the TVA. I did not see him in Tennessee, but in the reception room, I saw a Chinese painting given to Lilienthal by the China Resources Committee. The second person to introduce is the former chairman of the board, Mr. Morgan, the current director. He is from Ontario, Canada, and Ontario is a famous place for hydroelectric power generation. (The father of the TVA, Norris, gained a lot of experience in Ontario.) After graduating from the University of Ontario, he moved to Louisiana in the southern United States, where he studied horticulture and entomology at the state university and formally applied to join the US nationality. Because of his profound agricultural knowledge, he gradually established a reputation in the American agricultural field. In 1905, Morgan left Louisiana for Tennessee, where he taught at Tennessee State University. In 1913, Morgan was promoted to dean of the agricultural college. In 1919, he was appointed president of the University of Tennessee. Morgan is now 79 years old, and his hair is already bald. During the First World War, he also managed the grain of the entire province of Tennessee. His administrative experience is characterized by fairness and integrity. In academia, he is now a leading figure in American agriculture. He served as the chairman of the board of the local TVA in 1938, but resigned in 1941 due to lack of energy and served as a director.</p>
<p>The third director is Pople. Pople only became a director of the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1939. He is from Louisiana and is 62 years old this year. He was known as an athlete in his youth and was a football player in Louisiana. He studied law at the University of Chicago and later became a lawyer and judge in Idaho. Finally, in 1933, he was elected to the US Senate. In 1939, Roosevelt selected him as a director of the Tennessee Valley Authority. None of the three directors are from Tennessee, which is a characteristic of democratic countries. Currently, less than half of all TVA staff members are local residents of Tennessee. Breaking down regional concepts and boldly employing young people are two successful factors in addition to the "grassroots system." (End)</p>

<h3>City Council Examines Proposals; Conducted in Ten Groups Yesterday; Discussion Focused on Finance; Overturning Increase in Housing Tax</h3>
<p>Preliminary Resolution to Levy Municipal Tax; Horse Racing Issue to be Discussed Next Time</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] This time, the City Council's examination of proposals and policy reports was divided into ten review committees, which were held at three locations yesterday morning and afternoon, for the first and second review meetings. Except for the first group at the Fifth District Office on Popple Road and the fourth group at the Chamber of Commerce, all eight others were held at Myriad Garden. The sixth and seventh groups were set up at Yang He Shang, with seats arranged in a line or a U-shape. The discussions of each review committee were different, with some discussing proposals, some only discussing work reports, and some studying specific regulations. However, most of them did not have many cases that were initially resolved or passed because the review committee still had two more sessions, the proposals were not all printed, and the review time was limited.</p>
<p>Among the review committees, the third group, which reviewed proposals and policy reports on finance and land administration, had the most heated discussion. They also had important preliminary resolutions on the five proposals submitted by the mayor (i.e., (1) increasing housing tax, (2) organizing a municipal tax, (3) levying a cleaning fee, (4) public utilities paying municipal tax, and (5) restoring horse racing). Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, attended the meetings in the morning and afternoon to report and explain the case. Mayor Wu also attended the meeting in the afternoon to explain various issues.</p>
<p>Director Gu stated that the city government's budget for the second half of the year does not reach over 33 billion yuan, and it seems imperative to increase tax revenue. He gave detailed explanations for each case, agreeing to explain the advantages of increasing housing tax in several points: (1) Housing tax is a direct tax, which cannot be transferred to others, and it is not easy to cause abuses. (2) If business tax or banquet tax is increased, it will easily stimulate prices, so it is better to increase housing tax. (3) Tax revenue is stable and reliable. The current valuation method was completed by more than 30 experts over a period of more than two years, so it is extremely accurate, and it can use the old method of calculating the reduction of housing rents in the era of the Public Works Department, and reduce the reality according to the depreciation method of the construction company. According to the actual survey, the municipal tax should be lower than the housing tax. If the housing tax is increased according to the proposal, the city government can have an income of 18 billion yuan in half a year. If the municipal tax is levied, it can increase income by 15 billion yuan in half a year. The cleaning fee is about 8.4 billion yuan in half a year, and the municipal tax levied on public utilities is about 4.02 billion yuan in half a year, and horse racing is about 2.4 billion yuan.</p>
<p>After discussions among the councilors, there were different opinions on whether to support the organization of a municipal tax or increase the housing tax. However, it was resolved that the cleaning fee would not be levied, and a decision would be made on the two items of municipal tax and housing tax. As a result, by a vote of five to four, it was initially resolved to levy a municipal tax and not increase the housing tax, but in the afternoon, the group still had objections to the above two taxes. Mayor Wu also explained that if the municipal tax is levied according to the housing tax method, it is easier, otherwise there are more difficulties. In reality, the actual rent has increased by more than 140 times to 490 times, and the housing item in the cost of living index is determined accordingly.</p>
<p>Zhao Dihua, the convener of the group, believed that this case was very important, and some councilors did not attend the meeting in the morning. After passing the vote, it was decided to submit it for a vote again. As a result, by a vote of seven to six, it was initially resolved to levy a municipal tax, but the method has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>City Government's Budget for the Second Half of the Year is Compiled Like a Castle in the Air; It is Believed that it is Impossible to Review Before the Plan is Submitted; Auditing the Final Accounts is Proposed to be Handled Separately After the Closing Ceremony</h3>
<p>The ninth group audited the city's budget and final accounts. In addition to the councilors attending the group, Min Xiangfan, the chief accountant of the city government, also attended the meeting to report, and Hu Wenyuan, the deputy director of the Finance Bureau, and the chief accountants of various bureaus participated. However, after the report, the councilors all believed that the budget for the second half of the 35th year compiled by the city government was close to a "castle in the air." The budget should be based on various work plans, but now it is being done in reverse, with the budget being set first and then the plan, which is inappropriate. And the work plans of various bureaus have not been formulated, so there is no way to review them. Detailed reports should also be made on the expenses of business and operating organizations. It was resolved: (1) The written work plans of various bureaus should be submitted before the 17th. (2) According to the operating and business organization fees mentioned in the general budget, please also report in detail before the 17th. (3) Due to time constraints, it is recommended that the audit of the final accounts be handled by a standing committee after the closing of the conference. (4) A plenary review meeting will be convened on the morning of the 15th to discuss the budget issue (pending approval by the conference). An additional group meeting will be held on the afternoon of the 15th.</p>
<p>At 3:00 p.m., the ninth group joined the third group for a serious discussion on the budget and financial revenue and expenditure. Xu Yongzuo, the convener of the ninth group, presented several points of opinion to the mayor on behalf of the group: (1) The living allowance of over 44.65 billion yuan listed in the temporary items in the budget, plus others, accounts for seven or eight tenths of the total number of temporary items. It can be seen that the city government's expenditure on "supporting people" is huge, which is very noteworthy. In terms of reducing expenditure, there are too many people employed. Is it possible to use fewer people? (2) On the revenue side: The large revenue of the British and French Public Works Departments and the three municipal government agencies in the past was based on housing and land taxes, which was very large. What is not clear now is why housing taxes are not collected in Zhabei and Nanshi? If we have to wait for another year and a half for investigation and valuation before collecting, wouldn't it be a great loss? If the investigation is not easy, we can temporarily handle it according to the old case. Councilor Xu also suggested that if we want to find ways to increase revenue, we can think about increasing public utilities or issuing public bonds again.</p>
<p>The mayor immediately stated that he admired the points raised by Councilor Xu very much, but he added that the city government was not prepared to tighten up. The current living allowance only accounts for three percent of the total budget compared with the 25th year, which is the lowest administrative expense. The police force in this city is not enough, and many more must be added. If the city government itself reduces (it has already reduced more than 100 people) one or two hundred people, it will not have a big impact on the overall expenditure. In fact, it has been reduced to the lowest limit. As for the expenses of business and administrative affairs, it is fundamentally difficult to divide them. There is no such distinction in foreign budgets. For example, are the police or engineering contracting fees administrative fees or business fees? At the same time, politics is not on the right track, which has a great impact on municipal administration. The city government only requires the minimum tax revenue. What I must apologize to you for is that the preparation of this budget is indeed unsatisfactory. We will explain and plan for various work plans, but I hope you will not make rigid regulations. Wang Nai then raised the issue of the Shanghai Municipal Bank's income of over 800 billion yuan in the business income item, which is actually more than this number, and asked for an explanation. Mayor Wu explained this point, saying that the City Bank is only acting as an agent for the city treasury, and its business is entirely conducted in accordance with provincial and municipal banks. Depositing in the Central Bank is not as profitable as other commercial banks.</p>
<p>The ninth group then held a separate meeting and invited the chief accountants of the Public Utilities, Public Works, and Education Bureaus to verbally report on the concise budget and expenditure items.</p>
<h3>Examination of Specific Regulations</h3>
<p>The tenth group examined proposals regarding specific regulations and laws. Yesterday morning and afternoon, the group discussed and passed only two proposals, namely "The proposal to urge the implementation of the writ of habeas corpus to emphasize human rights and maintain law and discipline" proposed by Ma Junshuo et al., and "The proposal to request the judicial organs to promptly try and judge the cases of traitors." The rest were examinations of regulations, and each councilor was responsible for examining various regulations.</p>
<p>The group received a total of 140 kinds of regulations submitted by the city government for examination. Each councilor made a preliminary examination of a part of them yesterday, and will start examining them individually in detail from today. The regulations examined yesterday included: (1) Housing Rental Management Rules, (2) Housing Dispute Resolution Methods, (3) Housing Rent Standards, (4) Provisional Rules for the Collection of Housing Tax, (5) Land Title Methods, (6) Labor Dispute Handling Methods, (7) Rules for Investigation of Opium Addiction, (8) Measures for Violating Dance Hall Registration, (9) Measures for Private Construction of Sheds, (10) Measures for Temporary Construction of Sheds, and many other items. There are also new draft proposals from the city government, such as measures for managing wharves and measures for opening roads, which will be examined after the authorities have established them.</p>
<p>The review committee will strictly review the various regulations, and if there is no legal basis or conflict with the law, restrict the rights of the people, and increase obligations, it must be submitted to the Executive Yuan for filing.</p>
<h3>Whether Horse Racing Will Take Place; Heated Debate Did Not Lead to Any Conclusion; Mayor Explains That He Will Never Fawn Over Foreigners</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the third group's review meeting in Yiyuan was like a small battlefield. Following the preliminary resolution to levy a municipal tax by a vote of seven to six on finance and taxation, the difficult "horse racing" issue was raised. The third group was the last to adjourn at 6:00 p.m. This case, which is enough to concern all people in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, attracted forty or fifty people in the venue to surround and listen. Even a dozen waiters in Yiyuan widened their curious eyes, staring at each speaker, hoping to find a conclusion. Although the fate of the racecourse was still undecided by the end of the meeting, that fierce scene created its most wonderful scene in the review meetings of various groups yesterday.</p>
<p>Before listening to public opinion, the mayor stood up and gave an explanation. With sincerity and a bit of statement, he said, "I don't want to fawn over foreigners at all. I want to buy all 500 acres of the racecourse land as a gathering place, the council meeting venue. Shanghai is such a big city. Every time there is a big meeting, we have to borrow the Majestic Theater or the Grand Theater, etc. How can this be justified?" Then he said that he planned to buy the land and build a convention center on one side. The first floor would be a grand auditorium, the second floor would be the council meeting venue, and other small rooms would be used as review committee offices. The method of purchasing the land is to "take the wool from the sheep," open horse racing, and use the income as a fund for issuing public bonds. After two years, the entire land can belong to the city government. In this way, not only can the venue be solved, but also roads can be opened up to facilitate traffic. If they are not allowed to race horses, they will request construction, and according to the law, the city government has no way to refuse. In this way, after the houses are built, it will be difficult to recover them later.</p>
<p>Following the mayor's speech, the first to speak was Luo Qinghua. He said: Horse racing exists in any international metropolis. We don't need to take this issue too seriously, and we don't need to pay too much attention to moral concepts and oppose it. We hope that the mayor can do his best. It doesn't have to be after two years. It would be more ideal if we could find a way to recover it around one year. But I don't agree with holding it at the racecourse. Leaving aside everything else, there is one thing that needs to be considered, that is, the traffic problem. Nanjing Road is already extremely congested at present. In addition, with horse racing twice a week, it can simply cut off traffic. Chen Gongda firmly expressed his absolute opposition, feeling that horse racing is gambling. Allowing it to open after we have won is really inappropriate. Zhang Yiqu also opposed horse racing. Since he doesn't agree, he has to come up with a solution. Jia Dechao meant that it might as well buy the land at the old price. Yu Shun advocated exchanging the land in Jiangwan or Yinxiang Port. The mayor further explained: This is a factual issue. If this land is used for citizens to invest in purchases, it can be mortgaged, but if it is used as a public place, no one will invest, and the bank is unwilling to handle it. Speaking of purchasing at the old land price, it cannot be passed in the land law. Furthermore, if we exchange suburban land for them, will people agree? If horse racing is changed to the suburbs, they still want to build houses in the racecourse in the city, which is even more troublesome.</p>
<p>In the end, time ran out again, and no conclusion could be reached after further discussion. Wang Wei then proposed to keep this case for serious study at the next review meeting, and believed that this issue was too big and still had to be submitted to the conference for discussion. As a result, it was passed in this way.</p>
<h3>Regarding Sanitation</h3>
<p>The eighth group reviewed proposals and policy reports on sanitation. The committee discussed the proposals yesterday morning, and Zhang Wei, the director of the Sanitation Bureau, attended the meeting to answer the questions raised by the councilors. The group first combined and discussed the proposals in this category one by one, but generally passed them. Because there were not many proposals submitted at present, the review meeting was not held in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Public Works and Public Utilities Bureaus Will Report on Their Policies Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Today is the seventh and eighth meetings of the City Council. In the morning, Zhao Zukang, the director of the Public Works Bureau, will report on the general situation of his policies, and in the afternoon, Zhao Zengjue, the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, will report. There will also be questions from councilors and reports from the speaker.</p>
<p>[Caption] Director Gu Chunfan of the Finance Bureau attended the third group's review meeting in the upper picture, and the tense situation of the seventh group's review meeting in the lower picture (captured by this newspaper).</p>
<h3>Social Relief and Labor Issues</h3>
<p>The Seventh Review Committee. Special review of proposals and policy reports regarding social relief and labor. Seventeen people attended. In the morning, eight proposals were reviewed. The first proposal discussed was the one put forward by Chen Gongda, Wu Shaozhu, Zhuang Heren, Cao Jun, and others, stating that curbing inflation is a prerequisite for solving current livelihood problems. The review opinion was that the stabilization of prices should first depend on the availability of materials. If the supply of materials cannot be guaranteed, then prices will inevitably be affected. It was decided to pass the principle and merge it with the proposal put forward by Lao Jingxiu and others regarding the allocation of materials at parity prices based on population. It is currently temporarily reserved.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Committee reviewed the proposal put forward by Chen Gongda and others to eliminate labor disputes. Senator Tang Shichang stated that the Social Bureau should first provide relevant information before discussing it further. At this time, Pan Gengsheng, a representative of the Social Bureau, stated: The living expenses of workers are now based on the cost of living index as the standard, and judgments are made based on this principle. Senator Jin Hongxiang stated: The government should formulate regulations stipulating that: (1) Those who gather in crowds to surround others will not be mediated; (2) The number of labor and management representatives attending mediation should be equal; (3) Mediators should not be sent with biased views; (4) Factories should not be interfered with in any way when they close. Senator Bao Wenxin advocated that a minimum wage standard should be stipulated. Tang Shichang believed that: (1) Both labor and management should abide by laws and regulations; (2) Open and sincere cooperation between labor and management should be promoted; (3) National industries should be developed. Senator Dong Rengui believed that both labor and management should fulfill their responsibilities in this matter. Management should: (1) Stabilize the lives of workers; (2) Provide labor welfare; (3) Implement factory meetings. Labor should: (1) Improve work efficiency; (2) Comply with labor discipline.</p>
<p>The proposal to reduce interest rates on pawnshops and extend the deadline was passed in principle, and it is proposed to ask the General Assembly to send it to the municipal government for reference.</p>
<p>The review opinion on the proposal submitted by Wei Yunqing and others, stating that compensation should be negotiated for war losses and that victims of disasters should receive full relief to alleviate people's difficulties, was: (1) The principle is passed, and the municipal government is requested to issue a notice to all district and baojia chiefs to conduct a supplementary investigation based on the original household registration books before the war and submit a report within a limited time. (2) Regarding the valuation of losses, the current market price should be used as the standard. The current regulations of the Executive Yuan stipulate that the wartime valuation should be used as the standard, and the municipal government should be requested to forward it to the authorities for correction.</p>
<p>The review opinion on the proposal submitted by Xu Zexiang and others, requesting the municipal government to establish a Shanghai Municipal Vagrant Relief Institute, was to send it to the municipal government for adoption and implementation. When the meeting was held in the afternoon, the review of proposals related to citizen welfare continued, such as establishing a farm, establishing a citizen credit cooperative, and requesting the municipal government to provide relief to unemployed citizens. Regarding women and infants, such as investigating and providing relief to prostitutes, providing relief to infant refugees, etc., all were passed in principle during the review, and the municipal government was requested to transfer and allocate enemy and pseudo-properties for accommodation.</p>
<h3>Site of the Municipal Council. The Former Japanese Resident Group's Shanghai Theater is Favored. The First Review Committee will Submit it to the General Assembly for Discussion Today.</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper report] The issue of the location of the Municipal Council, which has not yet been resolved, may be decided today. When the First Review Committee reviewed various proposals yesterday afternoon, numbers 87 and 134 both involved the issue that the Council should have a suitable location. All review committee members absolutely agreed with this proposal. They also discussed the ideal location. As a result, it was considered that the Japanese Resident Group's Hongkou Triangle Market and the Shanghai Theater on North Sichuan Road were the most suitable. The former could be used as the Council's reception center and club, and the latter could be used as the meeting venue. The convener of the First Review Committee will make a temporary motion this morning to request that the above two places be provided for the Council's use. He will also ask the Speaker and Deputy Speaker to visit and report at the afternoon General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Increase the Number of Parks and Strengthen Management</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper report] The issue of parks in this city was also hotly debated in the Municipal Council yesterday. Senators Xu Zexiang, Tian Shujun, Wang Naixu, and others proposed that public vacant land should be used to add parks and that they should all be free of charge. However, some senators believed that building houses for civilians should be the first priority in today's severe housing shortage, followed by parks. Some people also believed that the cause of the current chaotic park order should be attributed to the low ticket price (currently only 20 yuan), so to rectify the parks, the ticket price must first be increased to 1,000 yuan. However, the majority believed that parks are parks for the majority of citizens and should not be charged. Therefore, after repeated discussions, the review opinion was that suitable public land should be found to add parks, and it should be allowed to be located in the suburbs, and the management of the parks must be strengthened.</p>
<h3>Regarding Police Affairs</h3>
<p>The Second Group reviewed proposals and policy reports regarding police and security. The committee reviewed the police department's work report yesterday morning and afternoon and raised questions about some policies, which were answered by Fang Zhichao, director of the department's administrative division, on behalf of the director. The group will leave the review of the proposals for the next meeting.</p>
<h3>Increase Tram Vehicles and Build the Pudong Bridge. The Fifth Review Committee Passes in Principle.</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper report] The Fifth Review Committee reviewed proposals related to public works, which are directly related to the people's livelihood, so the committee members had a heated discussion. The important ones are recorded separately as follows: (1) Gu Baoyu requested the municipal authorities to urge the tram company to quickly increase the number of vehicles, restore the original routes, and strictly train ticket sellers and drivers in order. Seven measures are proposed to improve the situation: 1. Restore the original routes as soon as possible, 2. Increase the number of vehicles as soon as possible, 3. Set up attendants at each station to maintain order, 4. Transfer the ticket sellers on the cars to serve passengers to buy tickets at the stations, and the driver will collect the tickets when they get off the car, 5. The car must stop at the station and can only start after the passengers have finished getting on and off the car, 6. Drivers and ticket sellers should be given strict training so that they have the spirit of correct service, 7. The municipal authorities need to supervise the tram companies to comply separately. As a result of the review, it was agreed in principle to pass it and send it to the Public Works Bureau for reference, and special attention should be paid to the strict training of ticket sellers and drivers. (2) Twenty-three senators, including Chen Peide, proposed building the Pudong Bridge to connect the east-west routes of the Huangpu River and to facilitate the loading and unloading of goods at the docks and warehouses, so that there would be no more accumulation and nowhere to start. According to the plan, the construction of the Pudong Bridge was discussed before the war, but it was suspended due to the war. It is necessary for the east-west average development of the Huangpu River in this city. The proposal is as follows: 1. Where should the Pudong Bridge be located from Pudong to Puxi, 2. The construction project can be contracted by professional talents or foreign merchants, 3. The articles of association of the Shanghai Pudong Bridge Construction Committee will be formulated separately, 4. The funds will be issued by the municipal government as "Shanghai Municipal Construction Pudong Bridge Bonds" (the method is to draw lots to return the principal), 5. The income will be collected by the Public Works Bureau as an incidental car donation, 6. Confiscated materials from enemy overseas Chinese will be appropriated to supplement the funds, 7. In the future, the land price of Pudong will increase due to this construction, and the land tax can also increase income. As a result of the review, it was submitted to the General Assembly and sent to the Urban Planning Committee for implementation of the plan. (3) Zhou Xiangsheng proposed that there are many travelers going up and down at the Mubu North Railway Station, and the traffic is congested. It is proposed to formulate remedial measures and suggest opening a trunk road directly from Tibet Road to the North through Nicheng Bridge to reach the North Railway Station. All the dilapidated houses or grass sheds that pass through it should be demolished, and the residents should be moved to the civilian houses built by the municipal government. The Review Committee considered it necessary and decided to submit it to the General Assembly and send it to the Urban Planning Committee for implementation in advance. (4) Please ask the Public Works Bureau to quickly repair all damaged roads in the urban area to facilitate traffic and rectify the city's appearance. After review and approval, it was submitted to the General Assembly. All damaged roads in the urban area were sent to the Public Works Bureau for repair, and repairs should be expedited at night. (5) If there are poles but no street lights in the urban area, they should be installed as soon as possible. It was decided to submit the proposal to the General Assembly and send it to the Public Works Bureau. Street lights in the suburbs should be installed before winter. (6) Increase the number of ferry boats, improve routes, improve employee management, and various equipment. The original proposer, Zhong Yuliang, painfully described the inconvenience. It was decided to submit it to the General Assembly and send it to the Public Works Bureau for adoption and implementation, and refer to the previous municipal ferry regulations for handling. (7) The third, thirty-first, thirty-sixth, and ninety-ninth proposals related to dredging rivers in the suburbs to facilitate irrigation and transportation were discussed together and sent to the Public Works Bureau for thorough implementation.</p>
<h3>The Demarcation of Provinces and Cities Should be Resolved as Soon as Possible. Local Autonomy Should be Strengthened. Someone Suggested Asking the Mayor to Go to the Countryside.</h3>
<p>The First Review Committee held the first and second review meetings at the Fifth District Office on South Huangpi Road. Twenty review committee members attended, and Zhang, the director of the Civil Affairs Office, and Li, the section chief, attended as observers. Zhu Wende chaired the meeting in the morning, and Chen Baotai chaired the meeting in the afternoon. The group reviewed proposals on civil administration and autonomy, policy reports, and other proposals that did not belong to other groups.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the secretary first reported on the focus of the group's review work. Similar proposals will be combined and submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. A total of thirty proposals were reviewed by the First Group, which were divided into eight categories: demarcation of provinces and cities, strengthening autonomous institutions, improving the treatment of public education personnel, local autonomous institutions' houses, electing district chiefs, council, visiting people's privacy, and others.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to resolve the demarcation of provinces and cities as soon as possible, the review result was to pass the original proposal and send it to the municipal government for thorough handling. The boundary between provinces and cities had been delineated by the Executive Yuan before the war. Currently, it is only a handover issue. The municipal government has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to order Jiangsu Province to hand over as soon as possible. Another proposal was made that the district divisions of the district offices and police stations should be unified to facilitate convenience. The review result was passed and supplemented by saying that the district divisions of the health education and other bureaus should also be consistent with those of the district offices.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal to strengthen the baojia organization and autonomous institutions, the review result was that the principles of management, education, upbringing, and health should be followed, the household registration should be thoroughly investigated, the public should be actively organized and trained, education should be stepped up, and public security should be strengthened. On average, at least two bao should have a national school, and self-defense groups should be organized in each district.</p>
<p>The review opinions on the proposals to improve the treatment of public education personnel, simplify administrative institutions, and increase administrative efficiency are as follows: increase the welfare of public education personnel, simplify the bureaus in accordance with the special municipal organization law, and thoroughly implement the elimination of redundant and incompetent personnel.</p>
<p>Regarding the election of district chiefs and deputy district chiefs to complete local autonomy, the review committee members believed that the original proposal should be passed and sent to the municipal government to urge the district offices to step up the work of examining candidates for public office. And earnestly hold the election of the civilly elected Jiaobao District Chief, so as to complete the local Bai Zhi in peacetime.</p>
<p>Please ask the Municipal Government and various bureaus to quickly replace the pseudo-officials. The original proposal was passed. Regarding this point, the central government has already given instructions. As for the houses of the district offices, please ask the Enemy and Pseudo-Property Handling Bureau to allocate them from the municipal government's various agencies.</p>
<p>There is also a proposal asking the mayor to go to the countryside to inquire about the people's conditions in the suburbs, and it can also let the villagers have a glimpse of the mayor's demeanor. The review result was to send it to the mayor for reference, and it was also suggested that the heads of the various agencies of the municipal government accompany the mayor to the countryside.</p>
<h3>The Head of the Cleaning Team, Zhang, Expressed His Hope that Members of the Municipal Council Would Participate. Speaker Pan Will Submit it to the General Assembly for Discussion Again Today.</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper report] The Municipal Council has discussed twice whether to elect representatives to participate in the Receiving Work Cleaning Team, but it has not yet been decided. The Fifth General Assembly decided to reserve it a few days ago, and after the Head of the Cleaning Team, Zhang, learned about this from Hang Huihu, he will discuss it again. Head Zhang returned to Shanghai from Hang Qianwan the night before. A reporter from this newspaper learned from relevant parties yesterday that Head Zhang had read the Shanghai newspapers' reports on this matter in Hangzhou, so he rushed back to Shanghai first. At 6:00 p.m. yesterday, he met with Speaker Pan and Secretary-General Xiang of the Municipal Council. First of all, he explained that the work of the team was just beginning to clean up the Hangzhou part, so he had submitted a request to the central government for an appropriate extension of time, and said that according to the regulations, two members of the local provincial and municipal councils could be hired as members to participate in the work. Because the scope includes Shanghai and Hangzhou, he requested the Shanghai and Zhejiang Provincial Councils to each send one person. Zhejiang Province has already designated someone, and he hopes that the Shanghai public opinion organization can also have someone to participate together. Secondly, he explained that he previously thought that the Interim Council had ended and the official Council had not yet convened, so he did not send a letter inviting them, which may have caused misunderstandings. In fact, the central government specially organized this Cleaning Team to thoroughly clean up and rectify the officialdom. Therefore, if the local public opinion organizations can send two more people to participate, even if it does not quite conform to the establishment, they will welcome it. Speaker Pan promised to submit a report to the Seventh General Assembly today (13th) and continue to discuss it, hoping to enable the local public opinion organizations and the central supervisory agencies to cooperate with each other and contribute to the cleaning up of the receiving work.</p>
<p>The Work in Hangzhou is Simple. Dinghai Needs to be Inspected.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper report] The head of the group also told reporters: The orderliness of Hangzhou's municipal administration is commendable, and he said that the receiving work in Zhejiang Province is relatively simple, and cleaning up is also easy. And after full preparation in advance, the work is proceeding very smoothly. However, in Dinghai, the navy had a conflict with the police when they received it, and the military discipline seemed to be too bad. It was decided that two members, Zhang Qingzhen and Wu Wangji, would go to the field to investigate the truth and investigate the responsibility. The Cleaning Team inspected three warehouses on the second day of arriving in Hangzhou. The general situation was good, and it is expected that the work in Hangzhou will be completed in one week. As of today, it has been full fifty days since the group started working on July 24. According to the statistics of the group's secretariat, a total of 309 secret reports have been received in Shanghai, all of which have been processed. About 70% have been completed, and about 30% have been processed but not yet completed. The group has received a total of 489 documents in Shanghai, sent out 248 documents, and 111 reports from various receiving agencies. The total number of official documents is 858. The group, in view of the particularly complex cleaning work in Shanghai, has obtained the consent of the Joint Office of the Cleaning Team to extend the deadline to the end of this month. In the next half month, the work in Shanghai will focus on closing the pending cases. However, secret reports with major cases will still be accepted.</p>
<h3>Inspector Cheng's Impressions of this Trip: The Organization of the Cleaning Team Was Delayed.</h3>
<p>[Another message] Inspector Cheng Zhonghang returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou last night because of the Cleaning Team. Talking about his impressions of this trip, he said: "The receiving in Hangzhou, to sum it up in one sentence, was heartbreaking to see. Many receiving agencies in Hangzhou now do not have original cleaning books. When asked why they did not have them, they said that when they received them, the first people who received them did not hand over the original cleaning books at all. Most of the warehouses we saw were scrap copper and rotten iron. For those scrap copper and rotten iron, many houses were also occupied and many people were sent to guard them. The Cleaning Team is now receiving various secret reports every day. The organization of the Cleaning Team was too late. The Cleaning Team can only play a role in various places now by relying on public opinion as a backing. When we arrived in Hangzhou, we found that in the hearts of the people of Zhejiang, their "leaving thoughts" from a certain war zone headquarters may not be erased for decades or centuries. The elders of Zhejiang still sigh when they talk about the mahogany furniture and sanitary equipment piled up and transported at the station. The most heartbreaking thing is that there are still many residences that are neither enemy nor pseudo, and are still being occupied."</p>
<h3>Regarding Education and Culture</h3>
<p>The Sixth Group reviewed proposals and policy reports on education and culture. The group received many proposals. Yesterday, it only divided the printed proposals into several major categories and combined them, such as national education, secondary education, tuition fees, and school funding issues, totaling more than forty items, which have not yet been formally reviewed and discussed.</p>
<h3>Jiang Qianfu Arrives at the Office to Work</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that Jiang Tingfu, director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, has resigned. In addition, after Jiang attended the review meeting of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, he recuperated in the hospital due to political and physical discomfort. The rumors that Jiang resigned have become more prevalent. Yesterday morning, Jiang recovered from his illness and was discharged from the hospital, and went to the office to work, denying the rumors from the outside world and saying, "It is not yet time to talk about this issue."</p>
<h3>Duan Maolan and Wang Zhengting Will Fly from the Philippines to Shanghai This Afternoon</h3>

<h3>The Aviation Construction Association Branch Actively Seeks Members</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper report] The purpose of the China Aviation Construction Association is to arouse public interest in aviation. Chairman Jiang also serves as the president of the general association. Recently, the Shanghai branch has also been established. Mayor Wu serves as the president of the branch and has initiated a movement to seek members. The following is a recruitment notice for permanent membership of the branch: "To establish a modern country, if we do not build aviation and strengthen air defense, it is like building a house on sand. Once a disaster occurs, it will collapse immediately. There are many examples in this war, which can be stated without赘言. China has a vast territory and a long coastline. Aviation is the only way to protect it. Land transportation is difficult and sea transportation is empty. Aviation is the only way to supplement it. Cultural imbalances and rifts between ethnic groups can only be bridged by aviation. The points that China urgently needs to build aviation are too numerous to mention. As the saying goes, don’t forget the past, it is a teacher for the future. The scorched earth in Zhabei on January 28 and the downfall in Southeast Asia on August 13. Is it that the soldiers are not loyal and brave, but the military strength of aviation is not sufficient? Our millions of citizens, after painful reflection, can't we make a plan to mend the fold after the sheep is lost? The purpose of the establishment of the Aviation Construction Association is to arouse the enthusiasm of the public for aviation and assist the government in aviation construction with the power of the whole people. The General Association is located where the government is located, and Chairman Jiang also serves as the president of the General Association. The Shanghai Branch was established with the reconstruction of the country. It has been more than a year from preparation to establishment, and it has a rough scale. Guo Zhen succeeded as the head of the branch. The outline of the work this year, to mention the main points, is to recruit 300,000 members to participate in the aviation construction work, collect membership fees, build a parachute tower in Shanghai, open a flight club, and establish an aviation museum, etc. However, it is a big and costly thing. If you want to succeed, you must rely on the support of all parties and the cooperation of the city. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. The most prosperous humanities. The public is easy to lift. Gathering sand into a tower. The above-mentioned facilities are waiting for the joint advocacy of the wise men from all walks of life. Adding people to the permanent members of the body is a real hope. It is the beginning."</p>

<h3>The Police Bureau Held a Commemorative Meeting Yesterday to Mark the First Anniversary of the Unified Takeover of Municipal Police Power</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper report] Yesterday was the first anniversary of the unified takeover of municipal police power in Shanghai. The Police Bureau held a special commemorative meeting at the square on the ground floor of the general bureau on Fuzhou Road. The meeting place was simply and solemnly decorated. At 4:00 p.m., the meeting began. After Director Guan led the ceremony, he made a speech, saying: "The police administration of this city has been controlled by foreigners for more than 100 years. The government's police power only extended to Nanshi, Zhabei, and the suburbs of the city. Since this day last year, police power has been unified. On this historic day of remembrance, it is necessary to review the past work. We should be vigilant and review at any time: (1) We should first unite as one and work hard in our respective positions. I will never want to see some people wearing police uniforms and exercising police powers, but deviating from their police positions and willingly committing illegal and undisciplined acts. (2) Shanghai is an international city. We must not still engage in work with the knowledge and experience we had in the inland areas. In other words, we should strive to improve our technology and make efforts in all aspects in order to adapt to the needs of an international city." Finally, Xuan氏 emphasized that in the future, we should focus on practical work and replace the word "say" with the word "do", and gave the following instructions: "Diligence to make up for clumsiness, frugality to cultivate integrity, impartiality to handle affairs, and sincerity to treat others." The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m., followed by a dinner party. From 8:00 p.m., a recreational event was held at the Police Club at 47 Shaoxing Road.</p>

<h3>Wife Was Intimate with Someone, Provoking a Tragic Killing</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper report] A Polish man named Xue Kesgai lives in Room 6, Building 12, Lane 833, Linsen Middle Road. Xue is 46 years old and loves to drink. He gets drunk every time he drinks. At 9:30 p.m. on the 11th, Xue returned from outside, already drunk. He stepped into the room and did not see his wife, Ou Qinggu, so he broke into Room 7 and saw the owner of the room, a White Russian named Jie Erbo, and his wife sitting and chatting intimately. He stepped forward and took his wife back to the room without asking why. As soon as Ou Qinggu sat down on the sofa, Xue went out alone again, went to Room 7 and punched Jie Erbo in the face. At that time, Jie Erbo saw that he was carrying an iron bar by his side, so he hid to the side of the bed. At the same time, he grabbed a glass from the table and hit him on the top of his head. After Xue was seriously injured, he fled out and fainted at the gate downstairs, gasping for breath. Later, someone reported it to the Lujiawan Police Station. Police Chief Liu Zhanghua and police officer Chen Shaobai rushed to investigate and took the murderer Jie Erbo to the station for interrogation. The injured person was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and died at 4:00 a.m. the next morning. The body was moved for examination, and it will be examined this morning.</p>

<h3>Flatten Black Market High Interest Rates and Save the Industrial and Commercial Crisis: Fourth Review Committee's Review Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Fourth Review Committee of the First Group Review Committee of the First Shanghai Municipal Assembly held two meetings at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning and afternoon. More than 20 committee members attended, and representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, Finance Bureau, and Land Administration Bureau participated. Chaired by Wang Xianqing, the committee reviewed 20 proposals related to finance, industry and commerce, economy, and food. Similar proposals were combined and provided with review opinions, and some individual cases were also submitted for discussion. The following is a record of the reasons for each proposal and the review opinions reached:</p>
<p>Proposal No. 10: Suggest that the central government send personnel to thoroughly investigate the personnel organization and capital sources of various real estate companies established during the enemy and puppet period.</p>
<p>Review opinion: It is proposed to ask the original proposer to provide facts and supplement the methods for further review. Proposal No. 69: Acquisition of foreign patented business rights.</p>
<p>Review opinion: The city's public utilities should be acquired and managed by the government and implemented one by one. Proposals No. 12, 57, 135, 185, 216, 276, and 354 are all related to saving the industrial and commercial crisis and cracking down on usury. Among them, the reasons for Proposal No. 354 are described in detail. Therefore, it was resolved to use this case as a blueprint and supplement it with three more opinions to be handled together. The reasons for the proposal are to suggest that the government promptly improve financial policies, actively handle production loans and rural loans, flatten black market high interest rates to reduce costs, stabilize prices, and relieve industrial and commercial difficulties to avoid economic collapse. The proposal provides five methods: (1) State-owned specialized banks should investigate the actual capital needs of industrial production of various factories and lend them as much as possible at low interest rates. Their collateral should not be limited to raw materials and finished products, and factory buildings, machinery, real estate, etc. should all be allowed to be provided as collateral. Acceptance and discounting of goods and commodity loans should be actively undertaken to ensure the smooth flow of goods. (2) To prevent excessive currency issuance, in-kind loans can be provided. The government should lend necessary materials, such as production raw materials, fuel, machinery, and equipment, to factories in need to develop their production. (3) The Central Bank should promptly and actively handle re-mortgages and re-discounts, and guide various banks and money shops to be happy to accept production loans, so as to establish a long-term capital supply market. (4) Loans for agricultural products should continue to be actively promoted. Loans for the production and processing of agricultural export products, such as raw silk, tea, and tung oil, should not be suspended. With the autumn harvest in sight, low grain prices are sufficient to harm farmers, and grain loans are expected to be implemented. Cotton will also be on the market soon. To protect the production interests of farmers, it is hoped that methods will be quickly determined and cotton loans will be handled in different regions. (5) The government should quickly formulate methods for land finance and actively implement them to develop agricultural financial undertakings.</p>
<p>The committee members added three supplementary opinions: (1) The government should stipulate that large loans should be lent to the production sector at the lowest possible interest rate and simplify loan procedures to save the industrial and commercial crisis. (2) Regarding loan interest rates, the principle should be to suppress them as much as possible. (3) Commercial banks have a close relationship with the industrial and commercial sector. The government should relax its management methods for commercial banks and effectively support commercial banks to achieve the effect of indirectly supporting industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Review opinion: Combined with Proposal No. 276, which proposes that the China Farmers Bank handle agricultural loans, the review opinion proposes that the Assembly pass it and the municipal government forward it to the central government for prompt and effective implementation.</p>
<p>Proposal No. 272: Proposal No. 19 by Senator Zhou Xuexiang et al. of the former Provisional Municipal Assembly was reviewed and passed by the Provisional Assembly, and it is proposed that the municipal government earnestly handle the case. The proposal calls on the central government to quickly start work on the enemy and puppet factories that have been taken over, encourage the resumption of ethnic factories, accommodate unemployed workers, and increase production. This is an important measure for stabilizing society at present and should be actively promoted and realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Review opinion: It is proposed to send the original proposal to the municipal government for recommendation to the central government for approval.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on Candidates and Appointments for Those Who Collaborated with the Enemy: No Candidacy for Public Office for Two Years; No Civil Servant Status for One to Five Years; Executive Yuan's Instructions Sent to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu yesterday ordered all subordinate agencies to comply with the Executive Yuan's instructions and stipulated the measures for restricting the candidacy and appointment of personnel who held positions in puppet organizations or their affiliated agencies and groups. These measures were formulated based on Article 15 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. The main contents, as learned by reporters, are as follows: (1) Those who held positions in puppet organizations or their affiliated agencies and groups and were not convicted under the Regulations on Punishing Traitors shall not be candidates for public office for two years. (2) The following personnel shall not be civil servants: (A) Those who held positions as heads of puppet Simplified Appointment positions or puppet Recommended Appointment positions, or heads of puppet Appointed Positions agencies, or equivalent positions for five years. (B) Those who held puppet Recommended Appointment positions other than heads of agencies, or heads of puppet Appointed Positions agencies, or equivalent positions for four years. (C) Those who held puppet Appointed Positions other than heads of agencies, or equivalent positions for two years. (D) Those who held positions as directors or supervisors of puppet groups, or equivalent positions for two years. Other staff for one year. (3) If a candidate for public office or an appointee passes an examination or is qualified by a civil servant appointment review, and it is discovered that they held a position in a puppet organization or its affiliated agency or group, their qualification shall be revoked, their election shall be invalid, and their appointment shall be dismissed. (4) Personnel who held puppet positions but were not convicted under the Traitor Regulations shall be listed and submitted by central and local party, government, and military agencies to the Central Party Headquarters or the responsible Yuan for review and transfer to the Examination Yuan. When the examination and selection agency discovers the aforementioned personnel, it shall present evidence and be identified by the Examination Committee and the Ministry of Personnel based on their respective powers. However, if the person assisted in the War of Resistance or engaged in acts beneficial to the people during their tenure in the puppet position, or if their position was a specialized technology, and it is proven to be true, the examination and selection agency may, at its discretion, shorten or exempt their restriction period. (5) Those who knowingly recommend or recruit those who should be restricted under these measures shall be disciplined according to law by the original recommender or the responsible superior officer.</p>
<h3>Wen Lanting Sentenced to Eight Years: Silent and Wordless When Hearing the Sentence; Request for Bail Denied</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Following Yuan Ludeng's sentence of life imprisonment and Lin Kanghou's sentence of six years of imprisonment, Wen Lanting was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment by the High Court yesterday morning. Thus, the "Three Elders" who were famous in Shanghai have all been finalized.</p>
<p>At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, the Criminal Division 1 courtroom of the Tilanqiao High Court was crowded. The defendant's defense lawyers Jiang Yong, Zhu Fojiu, and Sha Yankai all attended the hearing. Court President Liu Yugui, along with Associate Judges Cao Jun and Qiu Huanbing, as well as prosecutors and clerks, ascended to the bench and ordered the bailiffs to bring up Wen Lanting. Wen was still wearing a blue silk long gown, with a white short shirt and pants underneath, light brown silk socks, and white-soled black shoes. He was holding a folding fan and was supported by the bailiffs into the court. His old friends and disciples all stood up from their seats and bowed to greet him. A medical examiner was still in attendance. After standing in the defendant's dock, the presiding judge said: "Wen Chunnan, the son of the defendant Wen Lanting, has filed a petition requesting a reopening of the debate. This court believes that the evidence has been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, the collegiate panel has ruled that the application is rejected. The judgment in this case will be pronounced today." He then stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Wen Lanting colluded with an enemy country, plotted to resist this country, and is sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for eight years. All property shall be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for family members." After reading, he sat down and briefly explained the reasons for the judgment (see the judgment for details). The emotions of the audience were quite tense. Looking back at the defendant himself, he shook his folding fan and remained silent from beginning to end. The presiding judge continued to say to the defendant: "If you are not satisfied, you can apply to the Supreme Court for a review within ten days after receiving the judgment." The defendant remained silent and made no expression. The defense lawyers then stated to the court: "The defendant is old and weak, and his illness is getting worse day by day. He requests to be granted bail for medical treatment." Judge Liu still said: A written petition must be submitted, and the collegiate panel will discuss and decide on it in detail. After speaking, he ordered the defendant to be returned to custody. His old friends and disciples stood up again to see him off, stepped forward to greet him, and bid farewell until the prison gate.</p>
<h3>Reasons Stated in the Judgment</h3>
<p>Defendant Wen Lanting, male, 77 years old, from Wujin, residing at No. 3, Lane 375, West Asmus Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Appointed defense lawyers Jiang Yong, Zhu Fojiu, and Sha Yankai.</p>
<p>The right defendant was prosecuted by the prosecutor for a traitor case, and this court ruled as follows: (Main text of facts omitted)</p>
<p>(Reasons) In this case, the defendant Wen Lanting in 1942, conceived the idea of surrendering to the puppet regime, joined the puppet Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, served as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, and later successively served as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Puppet National Commercial Control Committee, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Cotton Control Committee, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Citizen Welfare Association. He has admitted this in this court.</p>
<p>It is consistent with his statements during interrogation by the Military Statistics Bureau and in the investigation by the prosecutor of this court, as well as the records in the attached confession. There are also records of the puppet Commercial Control Committee meetings that have been retrieved as evidence. There is no doubt about the facts. What should be investigated is whether the crime of colluding with an enemy country and plotting to resist this country should be established. The puppet Commercial Control Committee was initially affiliated to the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce and later transferred to the direct jurisdiction of the puppet Executive Yuan. It was the puppet government's general organization that implemented its so-called new economic policy and intensified the control of materials under the instructions of the enemy. This can be seen in Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations of the Puppet Commercial Control Committee, which stipulates that "The National Commercial Control Committee aims to assist the government in implementing policies and handle material control matters under the orders of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and other competent departments," and Article 4, which stipulates that "The National Commercial Control Committee shall, under the orders of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and other competent departments, supervise and direct its members to handle: (1) the purchase and distribution of materials related to control—(5) the procurement of military supplies, (6) matters designated or entrusted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and other competent departments." The puppet Cotton Control Committee is an external agency of the puppet Commercial Control Committee and the highest authority for controlling cotton. Its scope of work is the purchase and distribution of cotton produced in Central China, the supply of enemy and puppet military needs and exported cotton, and the examination and issuance of cotton transportation permits. This is also clearly recorded in the puppet Shen Bao Yearbook (see page 733 of the original book). The defendant held important positions such as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Chairman of the Committee in this puppet organization's affiliated</p>
<p>economic control institutions. Judging from the nature of its tasks and the means of execution, it is naturally beneficial to the enemy and the puppet regime and detrimental to this country. According to Article 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, he should be held responsible for the crime of colluding with an enemy country and plotting to resist this country in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the same regulations, which is unavoidable. Although the defense claimed that he had served in Shanghai for more than 50 years and had a good reputation. He had to serve in the puppet regime to cover himself, and he had no intention of colluding with the enemy and plotting to resist this country. The confession and statements in the Military Statistics Bureau were made under environmental pressure and should be considered invalid as a basis for exemption from liability. However, if the defendant was indeed serving in the puppet regime for cover, then the Shanghai position he held in 1942 would have been sufficient to achieve this purpose. Why did he later serve as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors and Chairman of the Committee of the Puppet Commercial Control Committee, and Chairman of the Puppet Committee? His actions have clearly gone beyond the scope of cover and are aligned with the enemy and puppet regime.</p>
<p>colluding with each other</p>
<p>cannot be denied. Moreover, at the welcome ceremony for the new and old Japanese ambassadors, the defendant gave a speech as chairman, stating: Shanghai is the center of economy and culture, and its position is important. If handled properly, it can contribute to the war effort and promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, fulfilling its responsibility as an important rear base (see the puppet New China Daily, November 25, 1942). He also said in a speech commemorating the fifth anniversary of the puppet government's return to the capital: "After the start of the Greater East Asia War, the government, based on the determination to live and die together, cooperated with friendly countries to participate in the war, pooling efforts and rising up together...to enable the cooperative government to seek final victory" (see the puppet Shen Bao, March 3, 1945). The defendant did not deny the records of these newspapers when questioned by this court. He has shown his agreement with the enemy and the puppet regime in his words. It is self-deception to say that there was no intention of colluding with the enemy and betraying the country, and who can believe it. As for the confession attached to the file, it was handwritten by the defendant. The interrogation records of the Military Statistics Bureau were subsequently signed by the defendant each time and are inherently undeniable. Moreover, the defendant has admitted them in the prosecutor's investigation (see the transcript of April 10 of this year). There was no mention of "should be considered invalid," but in the trial of this case, he suddenly said that it was due to environmental pressure, especially the Department of Transportation certificate that failed to show how he was pressured.</p>
<h3>Xie Guansheng Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing to Inspect Various Judicial Agencies; It is Said that Zhou Fohai, Xi Mocun, and Others Will be Sent to Nanjing for Trial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Xie Guansheng, Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, accompanied by Chen Gemin, Chief Counselor of the Ministry, and Counselor Ni Zhengqi, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last for his first inspection since the victory. At 10 a.m. yesterday, accompanied by Guo Yunguan, President of the Shanghai High Court, Cha Liangjian, President of the District Court, and Huang Liang, Chief Prosecutor of the District Procuratorate, he inspected the High Court and the District Court on North Zhejiang Road and gave many instructions. At 11 a.m., he convened a meeting in the High Court auditorium to instruct all personnel, urging three points: (1) The knowledge of the new judicial personnel should be renewed daily and constantly seek improvement. They should not be satisfied with what they know now. (2) Speed—the general public criticizes the courts for being too slow in handling cases. Efforts should be made to correct this in the future. (3) Substance—cases should not be handled carelessly. Those who rush through things believe that their task is completed, but the disputes between litigants have not been resolved. Therefore, they should do things in a substantial and responsible manner. Finally, Xie also showed that judicial personnel should have the spirit of enduring hard work and complaints.</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. this morning, Minister Xie will go to the High Procuratorate on West Asmus Road, the District Procuratorate on Xuehuali Road, and the Masnan Road Detention Center for inspection. At 3 p.m., he will inspect the Tilan Bridge High Court, the High Procuratorate temporary office, and the Shanghai Prison. He will stay in Shanghai for several days and then travel to Suzhou and other places for inspection.</p>
<p>[Additional News] Minister Xie met with reporters from various newspapers in the District Court office yesterday morning and answered various inquiries, saying: (1) Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, and other five people will be sent from Chongqing to Nanjing for public trial soon. (2) Regarding the issue of jurisdiction over the grain loan fraud case, the judicial organs have not abandoned their responsibilities, and the District Procuratorate is conducting an in-depth investigation. (3) Regarding the issue of prosecutor reform, some people in the Chongqing Senate advocated expansion, while others advocated abolition, and opinions were obviously different and still need to be carefully studied. (4) Regarding the deadline for reporting traitors, there are original regulations on the statute of limitations for crimes in criminal law, which are currently being studied. (5) The treatment of judicial personnel has been decided by the Executive Yuan to be improved. Judges in the Shanghai area receive an additional subsidy of 50,000 yuan per month compared to administrative personnel of the same level, while judges in other areas receive 25,000 yuan more. (6) The National Judicial Administration Conference will be held in January next year if there are no obstacles. Xie expressed regret over the continuous stream of corruption cases across the country. However, the judicial organs can only punish after the fact and have no right to prevent it in advance.</p>
<p>evasive remarks</p>
<p>are not credible. Comprehensive investigation of various defenses is still difficult to recognize as legitimate. However, the prosecutor's indictment also mentions Article 2, Paragraph 1, Items 4 and 5 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, but the section on supplying the enemy with military rice and gauze should not be blamed on the defendant (refer to the judgments of Yuan Ludeng and Tang Shoumin by this court). Furthermore, the portion of the indictment regarding the puppet Shanghai Citizen Welfare Association's fundraising for air defense donations concerns relief for air raid casualties and cannot prove any harm to the country or the people and can be disregarded. Second, the defendant served in the business community before the war and had a good reputation, and he was noticed by the enemy and the puppet regime early on. The Shanghai market fell into aging decline, and he failed to retreat in time. His participation in the puppet regime was due to the difficulty of the situation, which led to his accomplishment. Compared with ordinary people who willingly surrendered to the enemy for profit, there is a difference. Moreover, the defendant usually engaged in social charity. At the beginning of the Shanghai occupation, he managed hospitals for wounded soldiers and refugee shelters, saving many lives. This has been stated in court by witnesses Huang Hanzhi and Zhu Kuichen. After serving in the puppet regime,</p>
<p>he served as a defector and collected intelligence, and a secret radio station was set up in his home to communicate with the rear. There are also official letters from the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and certificates from Central Committee member Li Mingyang for verification. As for the central underground workers and loyal gentry who were rescued or sheltered by him, such as Yu Xiangqin, Qi Zaiyu, Wu Shiyi, Zhang Shutung, Mi Jifang, Chen Lengseng, Lu Huimin, Zhang Shuwei, etc., dozens of them have competed to go to court or provide written testimony. Other facts, such as the preservation of large yarn factories due to negotiation and the delay of various parties, the fact that small yarn factories were not eliminated, the obstruction of the dedication of ingot tributes, and the cultivation of textile talents, have been presented in evidence by Shen Boqin of Yushan Textile Company, Wu Kunsheng of Shenxin Textile Factory No. 9, and dozens of other companies. In summary, his acts of assisting the War of Resistance and benefiting the people are numerous. Weighing against the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases, it is indeed in conformity, and should be reduced in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>mitigate the original punishment in order to show fairness. All property will be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for family members. Based on the above arguments, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Article 3, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 19 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Proviso, Article 28, Article 64, Paragraph 2, Article 65, Paragraph 2, Article 37, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. Prosecutor Ye Yushao attended court to perform his duties in this case.</p>

<h3>First Day of Food Box Distribution: Public School Teachers All Return Fully Loaded. Next Distribution Will Be of Poplin, Shirting, Etc. Many Elementary School Teachers Did Not Come in Vain.</h3>
<p>[Special Report by This Newspaper] Yesterday marked the start of the distribution of goods to public school teachers and civil servants in this city. Our reporter made a special inspection of the distribution point yesterday evening and found the order to be very good. Because yesterday was the first day of distribution, the authorities, fearing that unfamiliar procedures would cause excessive congestion, only notified sixteen units under the city government to collect first. Of the total distribution of five hundred people, in addition to civil servants, there were also elementary school teachers who rushed from Zhabei, Hongkou, and other places. Because they were unaware of the distribution procedures, they eagerly came from afar on the first day the distribution news spread. Although the distribution point knew that they did not meet the procedures, in order to avoid letting them come in vain, they still distributed to them as well, so that everyone returned fully loaded.</p>
<p>The distributed items included nine boxes each of K and D food boxes, all of which were surplus supplies from the U.S. military. The K-type food box was divided into three categories – breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Breakfast contained 3.75 ounces of diced meat stewed with egg, four crackers, one packet of coffee, four sugar cubes, one piece of fruit jelly, one piece of chewing gum, one portion of wheat paste, four cigarettes, and a bundle of cleaning paper. Lunch contained four ounces of cheese, eight crackers, one piece of chocolate fudge, seven grams of fruit juice, 1.2 ounces of carob sugar, four cigarettes, one piece of chewing gum, and one box of matches. Dinner contained four ounces of braised meat, four crackers, ten grams of beef juice, eight milk candies, one packet of coffee, 23 grams of carob sugar, four cigarettes, and one piece of chewing gum. The D-type food box contained a large piece of chocolate mixed candy, which contained seven nutrients such as cocoa powder, flour essence, sugar, milk, starch, and Vitamin B. Each public school teacher and civil servant could get nine boxes of D-type food, and K-type food - three boxes each of breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</p>
<p>According to Yin Tiyang, the director of the Goods Distribution Office, who told the reporter: There are a total of 120,000 registered public school teachers and civil servants in this city, and 50,000 have already been issued distribution certificates, with the remainder being distributed continuously. The first phase of food distribution will be completed by the end of this month. The second phase of distribution has been set as cotton cloth, including Indanthrene blue, poplin, fine cloth, etc., with an average of one bolt of cloth for every four people. Distribution can begin from the 25th of this month. There is also good news to report to the public school teachers and civil servants in this city: the Goods Distribution Office has signed a long-term contract with the Materials Supply Bureau, so that daily necessities and other items can be supplied continuously. Because there are many types of daily necessities, and various different daily necessities may not be able to supply enough for the 120,000 people in this city to distribute. To solve this difficulty, the Distribution Office has decided to set up several retail stores throughout the city for public sale. Public school teachers and civil servants can go to any store and choose at will with their ration cards. The office has now printed special light blue ration cards, with characters printed according to the Thousand Character Classic, such as "Heaven, Earth, Yuan, Yellow, Universe, Flood, Desolate," and so on. The "Heaven" card has been designated for food boxes, the "Earth" card will be designated for cotton cloth, and the "Yuan" card has a good chance of buying daily necessities. The section chief said that if there are enough items to distribute to all 120,000 people in the future, they will all be distributed equally. If there are not enough various items to distribute, then individual purchases will be adopted.</p>
<p>Regarding the food boxes distributed this time, it was widely rumored in the newspapers the day before yesterday that most of them were moldy, but according to the section chief, this is not true. Surplus supplies from the U.S. military are protected layer upon layer with wax paper, so even if a long time has passed, they should not be moldy. However, perhaps there are a few food boxes among them, which, after a long journey of transportation, have wax surfaces that have fallen off. If they have been in the warehouse for a long time, and are invaded by the surrounding heat, then the phenomenon of mold may not be entirely impossible. But this is a very small number. There may not be one box in nine boxes. Moreover, the Materials Supply Bureau has promised that any moldy boxes can be exchanged. However, according to the results of the Health Bureau's investigation, even a small amount of moldy food can still be eaten after cooking, and retains all the vitamins it contains.</p>
<p>Also, in order to explain the distribution procedures and make the situation of the office clear to all sectors, the Public School Teachers and Civil Servants Goods Distribution Office is scheduled to host the city's press at the City Hall Auditorium at 2:00 p.m. today.</p>

<h3>"Pickpocket Brigade" to be Sent to Court Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Special Report by This Newspaper] A "pickpocket brigade" composed of five to six hundred men, women, old and young, will be escorted under strict police guard to the District Court tomorrow (the 14th)!</p>
<p>The police bureau has made a great determination to eliminate all pickpockets in the city. The bureau has issued orders, strictly ordering each branch bureau to effectively arrest all thieves within its jurisdiction. This "general cleaning" started on the 9th of this month and is scheduled to be completed on the 14th, when all arrestees will be concentrated at the General Bureau. Each branch bureau has already begun to execute these orders; the New City Branch Bureau has caught eighty people, the General Bureau has caught more than forty people, and other branch bureaus have caught thirty or twenty people. The current estimate is that even though these pickpockets have already begun to "avoid the limelight," by the time the deadline arrives, the total number arrested will not be less than five or six hundred!</p>
<p>The police bureau plans to send all these people to the District Court according to law. After they are sent there, several of those with more serious circumstances may be sentenced to one or two months in prison. After one or two months, they will be released after serving their sentences.</p>
<p>What about after their release?</p>
<p>Find a job and start a new life - I am afraid that there will not be many companies or businesses willing to take in people with this kind of past history. The Caohejing Relief Center and Refugee Shelter run by the Social Bureau are already overcrowded. Go to work? The current situation of factories is really not prosperous. If they could find wages based on the cost of living standard, they would not have been forced onto this last road long ago.</p>
<p>Eight or nine out of ten of them will return to their "old profession." What the one-month confinement has given them may only be more "research" and improvement of skills: the "beginners" become "old hands," and the timid gain courage.</p>
<p>Among those recently caught in the General Bureau who are so-called "defeated on the battlefield," one is a boy surnamed Wang who is just ten years old. He fled from northern Jiangsu. His parents are teetering on the brink of starvation, and this child can only find a way to survive on his own.</p>
<p>He is hungry. Seeing someone carrying rice passing by, he went up and grabbed the rice. Unexpectedly, the rice was still in his hand and had not reached his mouth when he was slapped hard in the face. The person who hit him was not the waiter carrying the rice, but another slightly older "gangster." He wanted to fight back, but he shrank back. He could not beat that gangster. There are many new-style cars coming and going on the Bund, and he can only stand there, starving.</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone waved to him. This person was also a gangster, but he kindly called him over, gave him money, and told him to buy a bowl of plain noodles. That person told the boy surnamed Wang to go with him, but there was one condition: the child had to be his "target receiver."</p>
<p>What is a "target receiver"? This gangster is a pickpocket. After he steals something, to avoid attracting attention, he gives the thing to the child first, tells him to keep it temporarily, and then returns it to him when the owner is not paying attention.</p>
<p>The child happily agreed. He was hungry; moreover, there were so many people in Shanghai, and he was so small, and what he had to do seemed so easy.</p>
<p>Slowly, he also started to try to steal himself. One day, he stole a chicken at the pier. Suddenly, a big hand landed on his shoulder. Turning his head, he saw a policeman.</p>
<p>In the police station, he said innocently that stealing chickens was not the first time. Sometimes, he just stole one and ran away, but the chicken was snatched away by another gangster. When he was lucky, the stolen goods were sold smoothly, and he could get two or three thousand yuan and eat a few more bowls of plain noodles.</p>
<p>He said that what he envied most were those primary school students who were neatly dressed and went to school. What he feared most was what he was most used to—hunger!</p>
<p>"King" Arrested at the Gaofeng Ballroom</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Sun Hao, a staff member of the Penglai Branch Bureau in Nanshi, received a tip last night that a large number of pickpockets were dancing at the Gaofeng Ballroom in the Great World. At around 10 p.m. last night, Staff Member Sun led armed police officers and brought the informant there. After the informant correctly identified him, they arrested Shao Xingbao (23 years old, from Ningbo), the "Pickpocket King," on the spot. At the time, the suspect was trying to escape. The police officers drew their guns and chased him, causing chaos in the ballroom and damaging many tables, chairs, and glass displays. It also disturbed the Great World amusement park, and the authorities temporarily closed the iron gates. In the end, the suspect was arrested and taken back for investigation.</p>
<h3>Raping, Plundering, Kidnapping, Extorting, Massacring the People, and Committing All Kinds of Evil: Liu Xun, a Demon in Lianshi Town, Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Liu Xun, the supplementary captain of the 3rd Company of the Pseudo-Zhejiang Provincial Security Brigade stationed in Lianshi Town, Wuxing County, abused his power during his tenure and committed all kinds of evil in Jibu Township, Yu'ao Township, Lianshi Town, Wulong Township, Liren Township, and other places in the county, including raping, plundering, kidnapping, extorting, massacring the people. The local people all hated him to the bone. After the victory, the township heads and the Sanminzhuyi Youth League and others reported him. He was arrested in this city and imprisoned in the Shanghai Prison on December 15 last year. After the High Court concluded its trial, it sentenced the defendant to death, deprived him of his civil rights for life, and confiscated all of his property except for what was deemed necessary for the living expenses of his family at ten o'clock this morning in the Second Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Liu was wearing a plain outfit, had a flat-top haircut, and wore bare feet and cloth shoes. His eyes were sinister and his face was full of murderous intent. When he heard the death sentence, he immediately said, "Reporting, sir, I am really wronged. They have no evidence to accuse me. Heaven knows this." The presiding judge told him, "This court still wants to apply to the Supreme Court for a retrial for you." Upon hearing this, the defendant arrogantly replied, "I will appeal myself." After speaking, he was escorted back to prison by bailiffs.</p>
<p>According to reports, Liu Xun, also known as Liu Liben, was 42 years old and from Pingjiang, Hunan. He once participated in the War of Resistance. In April of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], he was captured by the enemy army in Wuxing County. After investigation, his documents showed that he had previously served in the guerrilla隊. Later, he was guaranteed by Cheng Wanjun, the division commander of the Pseudo-Army Fifth Division, and released in the 32nd year of the Republic [1943] and served in Cheng's 部. Later, it was reorganized and downsized, so he lived in Lianshi Town, Wuxing County, at his wife Shen Wenying's mother's house. Later, because He Jianzhang, the captain of the 3rd Company of the Pseudo-Zhejiang Provincial Security Brigade, led his troops to garrison the town, Brigade Commander He Jingsheng appointed Liu as the supplementary captain under He Jianzhang's command. After being stationed there for several months, he abused his power. In the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], he kidnapped Chen Quanmao, the deputy township head, in the 11th Bao of Jibu Township, Wuxing County. Township office staff Xu Yan, the Bao chief Shen Yuanchang, and others were redeemed with huge sums of money. In the same year, he organized a pseudo-police team in Yu'ao Township, armed with weapons, and committed violent acts of rape, plunder, kidnapping, extortion, and murder. He raped and extorted in Lianshi Town, and went down to the countryside to rob and kill those who resisted the war. In June of the same year, he accused Shen Yuxin, a villager in Wulong Township, of being an intelligence agent for our side. Because the extortion failed, he killed him. In January of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], he led a team to ransack Kandi, a Taoist in the 7th Bao of the township, and Liuzi River in the 9th Bao, etc. In September of the same year, he captured villagers Xu Fuyuan and others in Liren Township and secretly imprisoned them in the team headquarters, demanding rice for ransom, and shot and killed Shen Ruilin, the township head of the township, on the spot. Although the defendant quibbled and denied the aforementioned evils, Qiu Miaoxian, the township head of Jibu Township, Wu Benli, the town head of Lianshi Town, Lan Benying, the township head of Yu'ao Township, Niu Bingfa, the township head of Wulong Township, and Shi Damin, the township head of Liren Township, all detailed their accounts and testified on the record. The High Court considered that his crimes were unforgivable, so it sentenced him to death.</p>
<h3>Four Petty Traitors Sentenced in Various Places</h3>
<p>On the same day, several suspected traitors were also sentenced, including Wu Binglin, the pseudo-Bao chief, and Gui Henghai, the translator, each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, and Shang A'er, the foreman, sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Also, Liu Zhaoding was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment. The defendant, with a sad face and tears, pleaded to the court, "Sir! Can't you lighten the sentence a little more? I'm really wronged." The presiding judge told him that he could apply for a retrial. Liu then nodded and followed the bailiff back to prison.</p>
<h3>Yuan Shixiang and Chen Huichang Scheduled to be Sentenced on the 19th</h3>
<p>On the same day, the trial of Yuan Shixiang and Chen Huichang, the managers of the Laoda Hua Ballroom and the Venus Cafe, on suspicion of being traitors, was concluded and scheduled to be sentenced on the 19th of this month. In addition, the three cases of Wang Qiugen, Shen Sanlang, and Wu Wenmao will be investigated again at a later date.</p>
<p>Also, the High Prosecutor's Office filed a lawsuit against Sun Zhonghe, Zhang A'wu, Huang Heting, and others on suspicion of being traitors. Xu Jinrong and others were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence.</p>

<h3>Female Hostesses to Obtain Occupational Certificates, Police Bureau to Start Processing Immediately</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] In principle, female hostesses in bars and cafes should absolutely not dance with guests. However, many female hostesses in this city also engage in dancing.

Therefore, it has asked the city government whether it needs to be restricted. It is now learned that the proposal has been approved by the city government, and the police bureau has drafted management regulations and will order all female hostesses in the city to apply for occupational certificates. Once the regulations are passed by the city government, they can be implemented immediately.</p>

<h3>Introducing "Soviet Light" Is a Sports Film</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Light Grand Theater recently showed a Soviet film, whose Chinese name is "Soviet Light". The content is all about the recent Soviet Sports Games, which is extremely exciting. Those in our country who care about sports should watch it. The writer solemnly introduces it, hoping that people in the sports world will pay attention. Don't think that "Soviet Light" is a film of another nature. In fact, this is exactly the valuable film that our sports world wants to see. All in five colors, the colors are beautiful, and the film shows thousands of male and female athletes from various Soviet federations gathering in Moscow to open the sports games. The film is full of performances of various group exercises, accompanied by music, with neat movements, novel programs, and a great scene. The whole film lasts more than an hour, which shows its length. The sports world, sports instructors, and sports teachers should all watch it to broaden their horizons. The staff who translated the film title seem to be responsible for causing misunderstanding. The original name of the film was "The March of Sports in Moscow", but it was translated into "Soviet Light". It is unknown what this light word does, and it is unknown whether the translator deliberately mystified it. If so, it would be counterproductive.</p>
<h3>To Increase the Speed of Soccer Games; Famous British Soccer Team Proposes Modifying Soccer Rules; Free Kick to Replace Throw-in</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] Norman Baucet, manager of the British Albin soccer team and sixteen-time selection for the British international soccer team, suggested that the soccer rules of the British Football Association be modified. Albin argued that when the ball goes out of bounds, the current throw-in should be changed to a free kick by the other side, which can also increase the speed of the game. Baucet recorded a record in a game last season, where a total of ninety minutes were spent on out-of-bounds balls, totaling thirty-five minutes. Baucet argued that the free kick in this new rule cannot directly shoot the ball into the goal. The British Football Association has designated two teams to try the new rules at the Birmingham Club's stadium today. Many people support Baucet's proposal, and many people in the British Football Association also agree.</p>

<h3>More Yarn Numbers Are Sold Off; Matching Yarn Emphasizes Actual Users; Textile Construction Opens 36 Types of Fine Cloth</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the yarn market fluctuated slightly. In the early morning, 42-count yarn was once quoted at 1.9 million yuan. Because Textile Construction unexpectedly allocated all yarn numbers to general applications the day before, most yarn merchants were not prepared for loans. Due to financial constraints, many were willing to sell off their yarn. Later, some people took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and the price continued to rise. At noon, 42-count yarn was traded at 2.24 million yuan. 20-count Alliance Phoenix, Shanghai warehouse receipt, was 1.34 million, a decrease of 40,000 from the previous day. 20-count 　Year was quoted at 1.2 million, but there was very little spot stock. Double Horse initially shouted 1.45 to 1.46 million and then rose to 1.5 million, with the highest transaction at 1.51 million. However, sales were not as brisk as the previous week. Textile Construction participated in the Joint Committee of Private Yarn Factories and supplied as much cotton yarn as possible to the group. The price of futures for Shu Yue Shuang Xian fell sharply. Originally quoted at 1.9 million, some people were selling at 1.95 million in the market because they could not afford to pay for the goods. General observation suggests that the yarn price will not rise exorbitantly in the near future. Today's allocation is still for general actual users.</p>
<p>The Second Phase of Yarn Allocation Remains at 30,000 Bales</p>
<p>The survey department of Textile Construction announced that the company's purpose for this cotton yarn price suppression and establishment of an allocation system is to distribute a total of 30,000 bales in the first batch. Among them, 20,000 bales allocated to private factories were fully allocated yesterday. Starting today, the company will begin allocating its own 10,000 bales. If this allocation result fails to suppress black market prices, the company will adhere to its original intention and continue to hold a second allocation, with the quantity determined to be 30,000 bales as the standard.</p>
<p>Yarn Numbers Plead for Restoration of Allocation</p>
<p>There are more than 400 cotton yarn firms in this city. Zeng Zu established the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Commercial Guild, with Tang Zhiliang as the chairman. The guild stated that Textile Construction recently did not allocate cotton yarn to cotton yarn firms with more than 80 years of history, but directly allocated it to middleman dealers and duplicating merchants, namely dyeing and weaving factories, underwear factories, towel and bedding factories, handkerchief factories, knitting and cotton weaving factories, and other five groups. The reason given was the suspicion that dealers were manipulating prices and hoarding. Therefore, there has been no allocation in the past three weeks, which is considered a mistake. According to Shen Boqin of the guild, in the late Qing Dynasty, the industry had no organization and only produced domestic yarn. Subsequently, India and Japan successively imported cotton yarn, commonly known as "foreign yarn". Later, British merchants such as Jardine Matheson and Laogongmao and others set up textile factories by themselves, which increased year by year. To date, state-owned yarn factories have 1.2 million spindles. Cotton yarn firms have been freely buying and selling on behalf of customers for more than 40 years. Initially, there was no guild at the Qingliang Pavilion tea house, followed by the establishment of exchanges such as the Japanese Exchange, which bought and sold short, speculated, and hoarded. Later, the central government ordered the establishment of an industry guild. Before the war, members of yarn firms bought and sold with duplicating merchants. Now, members are instead purchasing surplus cotton yarn from duplicating merchants at high prices. After members of yarn firms purchase it, they resell it to small industrial manufacturers, with the "Real Boat Brand Warehouse Receipt" of Zhongfang Company sold by Tongfengxiang Yihua as proof. Members of the industry guild not only do not raise prices and sell, but also duplicating merchants have the right to sell to yarn firms. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the guild held a tea party for the local press at 4 Ningbo Road, Tongheli, to report the history of the guild, the past situation of middleman sales, and the current plight of each member firm without yarn to operate. It is hoped that Textile Construction will understand the guild's history and restore the allocation of cotton yarn in the future to maintain business.</p>
<p>The Method of Ordering Payments Is Intended to Prevent Fraudulent Claims</p>
<p>The business office of Textile Construction stated that recently, there are many customers purchasing goods, and payments are crowded. To facilitate verification, it is stipulated that starting today, each customer's payment is limited to one bank note (bank or money shop crossed check), and the amount should match the total amount of the purchase order. All bank notes made up of odd numbers will not be accepted, and purchase orders with different account names may not be combined for payment to avoid errors. To prevent customers from buying and selling purchase orders, the company also learned that recently, when distributing purchase orders, various factories and firms often fraudulently claim payments. If this is discovered in the future, in addition to stopping the issuance of warehouse receipts, the payment will not be refunded.</p>
<p>Currently, 70% of Factories Are Operating, and Two Factories Have Shut Down</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the business office of the company, due to the impact of electricity saving, two factories, Tongxing and Dafeng, have declared shutdowns, but the remaining factories are operating day and night. The original spindle count was 800,000, and the current operating spindle count has reached 620,000, with an operating rate of 70%. The daily cotton cloth production reaches 16,000 pieces, and the daily cotton yarn production reaches 900 pieces.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Is Still Stable, and Textile Construction Follows the Original Price</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market price is flat. Blue V-shape initially opened at 62,000 yuan and then fell to 61,500 yuan for transactions. Serge was quoted at 63,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. Unbranded fine cloth was quoted at 53,500 yuan, and most buyers were for spot goods, while warehouse receipt goods were 500 yuan less. Various colored cloths were generally flat. Mainland 190 Shilin was 95,000 yuan, Jiuru Deep Shilin was 94,000 yuan, Shuanglu Yuan fine cloth was 66,000 yuan, twill was 65,500 yuan. Textile Construction opened 36 types of its own brand fine cloth, etc., still at the original price. 3A color ball was 53,000 yuan, and unbranded fine cloth was 52,500 yuan. 19 types of American-Mexican printed cloth were also opened.</p>
<h3>Loan Handling Fees</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Orders Strict Investigation</p>
<p>"Our Dispatch" The interest rate on bank loans should be based on the local central bank's announced rate, as stipulated. However, local banks often exceed the central bank's announced rate and convert the excess portion into handling fees, etc. Whether this is legal and whether it should be investigated. The Four Joint Offices has received a letter from the Ministry of Finance Jingqian Gengzi No. 1686, deeming it inappropriate and ordering strict investigation. It is reported that the Four Joint Offices has notified the six general banks and bureaus.</p>
<h3>Market Practice Gradually Improves; Stock Exchange Expected to Open Trading on Monday; Brokers Whose Initial Review Was Not Approved Re-submit Supplementary Documents to the Ministry for Review</h3>

<p>Also, the Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee held its 16th meeting yesterday afternoon. During the meeting, the various documents that were re-submitted by the brokers whose initial review by the Ministry of Economic Affairs was not approved were reviewed again in accordance with the Ministry's order for further supplementation, in order to submit them to the Ministry for further review. In addition, regarding the two points that the Stock Exchange had previously requested instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance: (1) Promulgate the transaction tax collection method as soon as possible. (2) Determine the regulations for the substitute portion of the margin as soon as possible. It was resolved to request Gu Weiyuan Shang, a member of the committee, to go to Beijing again to request prompt approval of the method in order to comply with it. In addition, the Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee's preparatory work is coming to an end. After the completion, various committee affairs will be handed over to the Stock Exchange Board of Directors for handling.</p>
<p>Also, the brokerage business was previously limited to one type. Now, both stocks and bonds can be done concurrently, but another margin of 50 million and a cash deposit of 20 million must be paid simultaneously. Each broker is supplementing payments.</p>
<h3>Raw Sugar Falls Below Allocation Price; Sugar Market Gradually Changes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market weakened because the company opened the 13th phase. The price of medium sugar was 140,000 yuan per plate, and the price of raw sugar was 120,000 yuan, a decrease of 10,000 yuan. Therefore, the market was extremely weak. The minimum price set by the guild fell below the company's opening price, especially for raw sugar. The spot price of medium white sugar was 144,000 to 145,000 yuan, the price for delivery at the pier was 142,000 to 143,000 yuan, and the warehouse receipt was 139,000 to 140,000 yuan.

<h3>Sichuan Medicinal Materials Strive for Export; Set Up Test Site to Seek Alternative Export Routes</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Chongqing, 11th] In order to develop the export of Sichuan medicinal materials, the Sichuan Provincial Government has decided to collect existing medicinal materials from Sichuan to conduct variety comparison tests and further compare them with important foreign drugs. It has been designated to establish medicinal material test sites in Guanxian and Emei to study packaging, storage, transportation, and production costs of medicinal materials. It is reported that the current exports of Sichuan medicinal materials are mainly angelica, fritillaria, and ephedra, and currently, they are all exported via Shanghai.

<h3>Business Tax Collected in Different Levels; This City Can Order Separate Regulations; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests the City Council to Make Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently approved a letter from the Municipal Chemical Raw Materials Commercial Guild and specially suggested to the Municipal Council of this city to revise the separate regulations for the collection of business tax in this city, referring to the pre-war successful cases. The original letter briefly stated: In addition to handling business tax in accordance with the Business Tax Law resolved by the Legislative Yuan in June 1931, most of them have separate regulations within the scope of the tax law, based on local conditions, in order to suit local conditions. During the Anti-Japanese War, the government assigned business tax to the central government in order to enrich military needs. The methods of implementation of only tax methods in various provinces and cities have been abolished. The method of taxation has lost its flexibility, and the burden on merchants has inevitably been heavy. Although the association has repeatedly presented it to the Ministry of Finance, requesting it to restore the above-mentioned method, the reply has always been based on the tax law, and it has not been allowed to change. Now that business tax has restored the pre-war system, it will soon be reassigned to the municipal government for collection. The Business Tax Law Implementation Rules amended and promulgated by the Executive Yuan on August 16th this year do not restrict provinces from enacting their own separate regulations. The association suggests that the three items from the previous method should be restored. It is planned to ask your council to suggest that the municipal government, referring to the separate regulations and tax rate classification table for the collection of business tax in this city in 1932, have the Finance Bureau make a draft and submit it to the council for review and approval for implementation.</p>

Unified Bonds D remained stable, while Bonds A, B, and E fell by 50 yuan, continuing the uncertain trend.</p>
<h3>Gold and Paper Money Both Decline Slightly</h3>
<p>Smelted gold was very stable yesterday. Opening at 2,165,000, there was slight pressure, and it slightly decreased, retreating to around 2,160,000. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 53 bars at a price of 2,157,500. Afterward, it briefly fell to 2,150,000 before recovering. At noon, it hovered around 2,155,000.

It is heard that the order has already been signed and is expected to be exported soon. As for B.OP mark Taiwan fine black tea, which is in short supply, Indian firms have strong demand and are willing to pay a good price. Therefore, industry insiders are consulting with the production areas. As for the domestic sales of red and green tea, local tea firms and the areas of Suzhou and Wuxi are not showing weakness.</p>
<h3>Silk Firms Obtain Rations; Artificial Silk Prices Fall</h3>

<h3>Raw Materials and Finished Products are Taxed; Chamber of Commerce Appeals to Nanjing for Wool Textile Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Wool Textile Industry Association, listed four points regarding the current difficulties of the industry that are worth considering, requesting assistance in appealing for a delay in the collection of the wool textile goods tax. A special telegram was sent to the Nanjing Executive Yuan, requesting approval for a temporary suspension of the tax. The original telegram stated: "The industry is suffering from the pressure of foreign goods, high raw material prices, and increased wages, and 30% of businesses have already closed. Now there is a tax on wool yarn and another tax on wool textiles, which is essentially double taxation on the same item, adding insult to injury. This is not in line with the national policy of protecting industry. Therefore, it is necessary to temporarily suspend the collection of the industry's goods tax."</p>

<h3>Ten Thousand People Vie to See the Zhejiang Tide</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 7th, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>The Qiantang River's tidal bore has always been famous. As far back as the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, many high-ranking officials came to Qiantang to watch the tide every year on the 18th day of the eighth lunar month. During the Qing Dynasty, Emperor Qianlong sent representatives to Haining twice to observe the tide and spent a great amount of national funds to rebuild the Sea God Temple, showing that repairing the stone seawall was indeed the emperor's accomplishment. However, the emperor was the "son of heaven," and the emperor's respect for the Sea God also required the common people to piously worship, and this worship was to make the common people believe in the emperor and prevent anyone from seizing the emperor's position.</p>
<p>Recently, the number of people coming to Hangzhou from Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places to watch the tide has been increasing day by day. All the hotels are fully booked, and all vehicles going to Haining have been reserved. Hangzhou is full of accents from the Shanghai-Nanjing line, and restaurants, entertainment venues, and fruit stalls are thriving three times as much as usual. It is expected that on the 13th (i.e., the 18th day of the eighth lunar month), 40,000 people will go to Haining to watch the tide.</p>
<h3>Twenty Thousand People from Nanjing-Shanghai Area Want to See the Tide</h3>
<p>Since the Republic of China, there have been even more tide watchers after the 15th day of the eighth lunar month. From Qibao in Hangzhou to Chenwengang in Haining and beyond, the sea wall is filled with spectators. Nanjing and Shanghai both have special trains to Hangzhou, or transfers to Haining from Chang'an. On the long seawall from Qibao to Haining, many people set up stands, food stalls, and even temporary Chinese and Western restaurants. Haining is even more crowded, with all the hotels, large and small, fully booked. Even just a spot on the floor in an inn can be sold at a high price. In the middle of the night, some people waiting for the tide, not sleeping, suddenly shout, "The tide is coming!" The guests hurriedly dress and rush to see the annual Qiantang River tide. Although everyone has been fooled, they still smile and have no complaints.</p>
<p>During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, Hangzhou and Haining were successively occupied by the Japanese. The Japanese were most afraid of our guerrilla teams and did not allow people to gather. The tide came with great force, but without the cheering from the people on the shore, it quietly left, and the stone seawall collapsed quite a bit.</p>
<p>Last year (the 34th year of the Republic of China), the enemy had just surrendered. Although the tide could be watched, everyone had no mood or courage to watch it because it was not known whether the road was easy to travel. This year (the 35th year of the Republic of China) in July, the Nanjing-Shanghai area has already been brewing the organization of "tide-watching groups." Although in the early part of the eighth lunar month, the two railway bureaus said that the road surface of Changning Road was uneven and no special trains would be opened, the people watching the tide were still preparing. According to my knowledge, at least 20,000 people from the Nanjing-Shanghai area are going to watch the tide. Just taking Hangzhou as an example, people from large and small organizations and groups are preparing to watch the tide, and even more from the business community. Some have already chartered cars, and some are already in contact with transportation. China Travel Service and several car companies have formed tide-watching groups to watch the tide. I believe that on the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, if the weather is clear, Hangzhou will definitely become a city of empty streets.</p>
<h3>Haining Shops Are All Decorating and Arranging</h3>
<p>On the Haining side, the seaside park is being cleaned up, stands are being built, and each store is decorating and arranging. Some families are specially vacating their houses to be used as inns and restaurants. These many stores are competing with each other, trying to outdo each other, and striving to do business. It is just that the Sea God Temple has collapsed beyond recognition, and the city appearance has been destroyed beyond all standards. They can only build some sheds on the ruins of broken walls as a base for doing business, and hang high gasoline lamps as a symbol to attract customers.</p>
<p>Why is the 18th day of the eighth lunar month particularly lively? In the past, according to the emperor's regulations, this day was the birthday of the Tide God (that is, the Sea God). Many farmers did go to worship because of the tide, and many fashionable people also went to join in the fun and burn incense at the Sea God Temple. Of course, their main purpose was still to watch the tide.</p>
<p>According to scientific research: the factors that form the tide are the radiation and attraction relationship of sunlight and moonlight. When radiation reaches a certain level, tides occur. Because the moon is closer to the earth, the tides are often determined by the movement of the moon. Our lunar calendar is based on the moon, so the tide must be large on the 15th day of each lunar month, and especially large from the 15th to the 18th day of the eighth lunar month.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the entire earth, there are only two pieces of land and a large peninsula in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, the Southern Hemisphere can be said to be a vast ocean. It is illuminated by moonlight, so the tide is a common thing. However, this tide is a primitive tide, with a difference of only one foot between high and low tide. The ocean flows from the south to the edge of the vast plains in the north. Because the coastline has different widths, it creates relatively high waves. Tidal bores like the Qiantang River are not unique in the world. The tide between Newfoundland, Canada, also has a difference of 50 feet between high and low tide. The Haizhou Bay in our country also has a difference of two zhang between high and low tide, but it takes six hours for the tide to rise and six hours for the tide to recede, unlike the Qiantang River tidal bore, which rises and falls so quickly.</p>
<p>The fame of the Qiantang River tide lies in having a "tidal head" Tidal of Bore; that is, the tide rises suddenly within one-fifth of the time of rising tide, and then rises again after forty minutes, thus creating a spectacular phenomenon of rushing and surging, like thousands of troops and horses swarming. Therefore, many hydrologists from around the world come to Zhejiang to study it.</p>
<p>We Chinese people often only know how to watch the tide, but do not know the origin of the tide, and where the strangeness of the Zhejiang tide lies. Some people even think that the real Sea God is playing tricks, the Sea God is showing his power, and the Sea God is appearing.</p>

<h3>Qiantang River Tides Always Bring Comfort</h3>
<p>According to science, to measure the time the tide comes, the 15th day of the lunar month will be around 12:15 (the time for the following sections is the same), the 16th day at 13:00, the 17th day at 13:45, and the 18th day at 14:30. Afterwards, the tide arrival time decreases by forty-eight minutes each day, and the tide also gradually decreases because it has reached its peak; it gradually increases from the tenth of each month.</p>
<p>We should not just ignorantly worship the "tide" and let it go, because this kind of worship cannot stop it from destroying your dikes and your homes. We should not passively defend it, because passive defense is indefensible. Military strategy once said: "Prepare for future troubles, prepare for past troubles, be prepared for everything, and there will be no troubles." Therefore, the most proactive and best method is to guide it and use it to our advantage.</p>
<p>Many water conservancy engineering experts told me: "If we want to harness the Qiantang River, we must plan the riverbed so that the water has a certain channel, so that it does not flow east and west. When the tide comes, we can use it for hydroelectric power generation, and this powerful electricity can be accumulated and used." Yes, this plan still needs to be studied and worked on, but if we have ideals, we will succeed, and if we work hard, we will eventually achieve results.</p>
<p>We firmly oppose the past ignorant worship of the Tide God. We are the people of the twentieth century. We must stand up and fight the sea tide. As long as those of us who passively enjoy watching the tide and the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang make sustained efforts, the tides on the banks of the Qiantang River will one day bring us infinite comfort.</p>

<h3>Four Philanthropists Cooperate to Donate a Large Sum of Money; Emergency Loan to Proceed Soon; Decide to Formulate Regulations, Appoint Special Hospitals, and Handle with Caution; Set up a Committee to be Responsible for the Custody of Funds and Distribution for Use</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Reading the community service column of your esteemed newspaper, I learned that an anonymous person initiated a temporary emergency loan fund. This matter is beneficial to the poor and sick and is truly significant. For the sake of supporting its early realization, Zhaolin and others have specially collected 15 million yuan, specifically for the use of this loan. We hope that your newspaper will handle it as soon as possible for the benefit of society. We eagerly await its success. Respectfully, to the Shen Bao (Also, if the funds can be stored in a bank, we request the bank to particularly increase the deposit interest rate, so that more emergency cases can be helped).</p>
<p>Respectfully, Zou Zhaolin, Jiang Xuexi, and Ye Desheng, September 12th</p>
<p>[Editor's Note] This letter and donation were delivered personally by an old clerk, roughly fifty years old, at 2:30 PM yesterday. At that time, besides asking him to convey my thanks, I inquired about the donors' backgrounds, occupations, and motives for donating…etc. He said that the donors instructed "doing good does not require much talk," and requested that the letter be published to inspire the compassion of people in society and to jointly promote righteous deeds. These few words are enough to show the benevolence and world-saving hearts of Mr. Zou, Jiang, and Ye, which are sure to achieve the noble ideal of "doing good is the greatest joy."</p>
<p>This good news had just spread throughout our colleagues when another pleasant report arrived, saying that the "anonymous" Mr. who first proposed the "emergency loan" in the letter the day before yesterday had sent an additional 3 million yuan, combining with the already donated 2 million, making it 5 million yuan. Thanks to the cooperation of the four benevolent philanthropists, it happens to be the whole number of the 12 million yuan that we proposed for the "emergency fund." It is predicted that emergency patients at sea will be spared from endless suffering and disaster due to the cooperative donation of these four benevolent philanthropists, achieving immeasurable happiness of "stability and well-being in all directions." This is such a fortunate omen. The original letter from the "anonymous" benefactor is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Editor: Reading your esteemed newspaper's community service section on the 10th, I am deeply grateful that my request has been accepted! It also indicates that if the basic amount cannot be raised to 20 million yuan, it would be difficult to start, which is indeed a fact. However, I find it difficult to increase the amount by 18 million yuan all at once. However, I believe that there must be many worthy people in society who agree with this cause. To the best of my ability, I am sending another 3 million yuan. There is still a shortage of funds, and I think that in the short term, there will definitely be generous people who will respond enthusiastically. I am sending this special letter to express my gratitude. Respectfully, to the Shen Bao Anonymous, September 12th</p>

<h3>Married in Shanghai, Coming from Nanjing; Zhuang Xinzhou's Residence in Nanjing Burglarized and Recovered</h3>
<p>— Report from our reporter in Nanjing</p>
<p>The Hunan Road Police Station under the jurisdiction of the Capital Northern District Police Department reported on the 6th of this month that a leather suitcase was found on the lawn of the High Gate Building. It contained clothing of considerable value. After inspection, it was learned that it belonged to Mr. Zhuang Xinzhou of No. 15 High Gate Chess.

<h3>Public Utility Prices Should Not Be Too High; Suggest Municipal Council Approve Reasonable Standards</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau of our city is actively increasing the number of public buses operated by the bureau and opening new routes for the development of public transportation in our city, which is praised by all citizens. However, the fare for the routes opened by the bureau recently is too high, which is not in line with the purpose of facilitating citizen transportation, and its excessive profits should also be corrected by our citizens at any time.</p>
<p>It is found that the bureau started operating route 6 public buses from Caojiadu to Laoximen in early September, and its fares are divided into five types: 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 yuan. However, when the prices of various public utilities were adjusted in the spring of this year, the bureau stipulated that the maximum price of public buses should not exceed 300 yuan. Therefore, the current maximum fare for the bureau's route 3 and the French-owned tram company's route 22 public buses is 300 yuan. It is found that the distance of route 6 public buses is not longer than that of route 3 public buses, but the difference in the maximum fare reaches 200 yuan, which is a ratio of five to three. Even in terms of the same mileage, the fare for route 6 is at least one-third higher than that for route 3, because the fare for route 3 public buses is only divided into five types: 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 yuan. Therefore, the fare for route 6 public buses is an example of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau raising the prices of its own public utilities.</p>
<p>The reasons why the citizens of this city object to this measure by the Public Utilities Bureau are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) It is estimated that the fare for route 6 public buses is approximately 4,000 times higher than the fare for public buses of the same mileage before the war. Its multiple is close to the city government's announced August worker living index of more than 4,500 times. The reason why the living index announced by the city government in this high-price environment is only this number is because the calculation of the index for some living expenses such as water and electricity public transportation is relatively low. Therefore, how can the price of public utilities rise as much as the living index, especially the business run by the Public Utilities Bureau itself?</p>
<p>(2) Currently, among the various public utilities in this city, the public transportation business has the highest profits, and among the transportation businesses, public buses are the most profitable. This is because passengers are currently very crowded, gasoline is cheap, but the fare has increased many times. (For example, electricity fees have only increased by more than 500 times, while public buses have increased by 3,000 times.) The operation of route 3 public buses, etc., of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, and the red public buses of the French-owned company, not only will not lose money, but will also obtain amazing profits. This point can be known by asking the Municipal Council to investigate. The current fare already has very high profits, so why did the newly opened route 6 public buses of the Public Utilities Bureau drastically increase the fare, increasing the burden on citizens, as if under the guise of a trust, forcing citizens to comply.</p>
<p>The reasons why the citizens of this city want to ask the Municipal Council and public opinion to pay attention to this matter are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Public transportation in this city urgently needs to be developed. The Public Utilities Bureau and the French-owned tram company are both preparing to increase routes in the near future. If increasing routes means increasing fares and attempting to obtain excessive profits, it is not in line with the principles of public utilities. Therefore, for the sake of the welfare of citizens now and in the future, the Municipal Council and all citizens cannot ignore this measure by the Public Utilities Bureau.</p>
<p>(2) The price increases of public utilities in this city are all approved by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. However, who approves the fares of the public buses run by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau? It cannot be decided by the Public Utilities Bureau itself. Therefore, I propose that the prices of public utilities run by the Public Utilities Bureau should be decided by the citizens, that is, approved by the Municipal Council. (Zhang Meng)</p>
<p>Is the Tax Collection Actually Handled This Way?</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I am a Hengjing person living in Suzhou. My family of several people relies solely on the ancestral farmland, which is insufficient to maintain our livelihood. This year, the government issued an order to pre-borrow tax grains, which is universal. And the newspapers stipulated 400 yuan per mu for managed land and 800 yuan per mu for self-operated land. The national tax, the people should of course bear, there is no need to hide it. However, the apportionment in my area of Hengjing is too unfair, and there are unexpected things. The largest self-operated land is apportioned to 5, 6, or 7 sheng per mu, so the content of such an apportionment method cannot be known. However, borrowing before not borrowing after, is still secondary. Even more chilling is that borrowing grain must be converted into cash, and grain will not be accepted, or directly sent to the county, etc. The price is set at 50,000 yuan (at that time, the market price of brown rice was about 40,000 yuan). In the past, the price of brown rice was used as the standard for paying taxes. Why this year for the pre-borrowing of land tax, it is necessary to change to collecting rice money? The government has clearly ordered tax grains to be collected, and the owners, etc., have paid grain, why is it refused? Not paying is as urgent as fire, which makes the common people flustered and unable to appeal! After paying, there is no evidence, only relying on one person making the register, how to deduct and reconcile later, the imperial national tax, the procedure is so simple, it is too understated. Not only can it not gain the trust of the people, it actually damages the country's prestige. Now I hear that the money received (50,000 yuan per shi converted price money) will be used to purchase indica rice in various villages (price about 35,000 yuan). It is said that each shi can earn more than 10,000 yuan. It is heard that the entire area has borrowed several hundred shi. With one turn of the hand, hundreds of millions of yuan can be easily obtained. If this is the case, how will you face the country and the people! (Concerned Person)</p>
<p>Speaking Up for Private School Teachers</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I recently saw the salary issued by the Education Bureau for private school teachers, which is 70% of the fees, and the remaining 30% is for school expenses. This is good news for poor teachers. But recently, a private elementary school in the western district of Shanghai. Its tuition fees are an average of 100,000 yuan per student, and there are about 300 students, but the salaries of the ten teachers are a base salary of 150 yuan per month, calculated at 720 times, and other allowances are completely cancelled. May I ask if this is what the Education Bureau stipulates? Can the Education Bureau manage and punish private schools? I am a fifth-grade student, and I am speaking up for the teachers!

<h3>Modern Views on Tuberculosis Prevention (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Shaoqing</p>
<p>A few years ago, although Japanese and Nazi militarism posed a great threat to human security, the danger of tuberculosis actually exceeded it. During our country's eight-year war of resistance, the officially announced number of military and civilian deaths totaled 3.1 million, while the estimated number of deaths due to tuberculosis alone in the past year was about 4.5 million. The situation in the United States was similar. In the first year after the United States entered World War II, 17,000 soldiers died in battle. During the same period, the total number of deaths in the United States due to tuberculosis exceeded 70,000. Tangible enemies are certainly fierce, but tuberculosis bacteria, invisible to the naked eye, are even more terrifying and dangerous. Taking Shanghai as an example, the rampant spread of tuberculosis is appalling. In the first six months of 1942, the number of tuberculosis deaths among residents of the British and French concessions was 2,269, while the total number of deaths from seven legally defined infectious diseases was only 1,002. This means that the mortality rate of tuberculosis exceeded the total mortality rate of the seven infectious diseases by 141.6%. Now, although the Japanese army has been driven out of the country, an even fiercer enemy still lurks in our families, organizations, groups, factories, schools, and the entire society and country, allowing it to spread and grow, killing 4 to 5 million innocent people every year, and causing perhaps ten times that number to be bedridden until death. Its rampant nature is of great importance to the health of the nation. Moreover, most of those who suffer from this disease are between the ages of 20 and 45, and their prime years are wasted in sickbeds, year after year, until their lives are cut short. The loss of human and material resources is incalculable. If Shanghai is like this, how can other provinces and cities be any different? A brief list of the drawbacks is provided for the reference of the public.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is an infectious disease</p>
<p>Infectious diseases and hereditary diseases are two different things. If Person A has pulmonary tuberculosis and transmits it to Person B through contact, it is "infection." If parents have a disease that is transmitted to the fetus through the blood, it is "heredity." Pulmonary tuberculosis is an infectious disease, so it has significance in public health. This is because one person's illness can affect the whole family; a staff member's illness can endanger the group. Harmful elements cannot but be controlled, and thus, measures for tuberculosis prevention arise. In Europe and the United States, tuberculosis is considered one of the legally defined infectious diseases, and laws stipulate that all patients must be isolated and treated. In the United States, if a tuberculosis patient endangers the safety of others, after being reported, the police will arrest the patient and send them to a hospital for mandatory isolation. Even if a patient's condition shows signs of recovery after a period of hospitalization, but their sputum still inevitably contains tuberculosis bacteria, if the patient requests to be discharged, the doctor has the right to refuse. If they disobey the doctor's orders and leave the hospital without permission, the doctor can report to the health authorities for intervention, ordering them to return to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment, striving to eliminate tuberculosis bacteria from the sputum completely before allowing them to leave the hospital. It can be seen that tuberculosis prevention is the responsibility of health administration, in other words, it is the business that national health institutions should have. This is the meaning from the standpoint of the word "prevention."</p>
<p>Work that should be done for tuberculosis prevention</p>
<p>Our country's science is backward, and there are no unified prevention and control facilities for tuberculosis. Even if there are some people enthusiastic about social undertakings who establish tuberculosis prevention associations and general tuberculosis hospitals, they mostly focus on treatment. It must be known that prevention and treatment must go hand in hand. Preventing without treating cannot improve the condition; treating without preventing is not enough to stop the source. Treating tuberculosis that has already developed is like putting out a prairie fire; even if it can be extinguished, the losses have already been immeasurable. Preventing tuberculosis that has not yet developed is like bending the chimney and moving the firewood away; with a little attention, a major disaster can be avoided. Therefore, tuberculosis prevention and treatment are closely related; neither can be emphasized at the expense of the other, and both must be developed in a balanced way to achieve maximum efficiency.</p>
<p>Since prevention and treatment cannot be separated, a comprehensive work plan can be roughly divided into the following items:</p>
<p>(1) Health education,</p>
<p>(2) Early diagnosis,</p>
<p>(3) Establishment of public health nurses,</p>
<p>(4) Tuberculosis clinics,</p>
<p>(5) Well-equipped tuberculosis sanatoriums,</p>
<p>(6) Improvement of patients' occupations and post-rehabilitation facilities.</p>
<p>The above six items are not necessarily new. People of insight in our country have mentioned them before, but they have not been realized due to a lack of modern scientific equipment and methods. Today, the tuberculosis mortality rate in the United States is 80% lower than it was 50 years ago. The reason for this great achievement is none other than the implementation of this comprehensive prevention and control work. The above six tasks will be explained separately or summarized below.</p>
<p>(1) Health education... This is the main task in tuberculosis prevention. If tuberculosis prevention can be achieved through educational methods, the cost is limited, and the results are significant. The general habits of our country are too unhygienic. To this day, we are still stuck at the stage of publicizing "prohibition of spitting," and knowledge of other tuberculosis prevention and control is even more rudimentary. The low level of hygiene is evident here. And the urgent need for education is even more obvious. There are many types of education methods, but in general, appropriate and effective methods should be adopted according to the level of the target audience. For example, general broadcasts of sound films, as well as other "audiovisual education" methods. Strive to make everyone understand, so that those who are not sick know how to prevent it, and those who are sick know where to seek medical treatment. Its great effect cannot be measured by numbers. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Symptoms of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Jin Baoshan</p>
<p>The symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis are extremely complex. For the sake of convenient description, they are divided into initial symptoms, general symptoms, and local symptoms.</p>
<p>(A) The initial symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis are extremely inconsistent. The most common are weight loss, extreme fatigue, weakness, indigestion, menstrual irregularities, anemia, and difficulty concentrating. After several weeks or months, regular symptoms such as afternoon fever, cough with phlegm, and night sweats follow one after another. Sometimes the initial condition resembles the flu, with symptoms such as fever, weakness in the limbs, and body aches. The symptoms disappear after one or two weeks, only to recur several weeks later. Sometimes the patient's first conscious symptom is blood-streaked sputum or hemoptysis. Sometimes pleurisy is the initial symptom of pulmonary tuberculosis, with symptoms such as chest pain, which can be exacerbated by deep breathing and exercise, fever, and difficulty breathing. It is rare for the initial stage of pulmonary tuberculosis to resemble lobar pneumonia, and is only seen in young patients and elderly, frail patients. The symptoms are the same as those of lobar pneumonia, but the duration of the illness is longer, the sputum contains tuberculosis bacteria, and the formation of cavities can be used for identification. There are also patients who are found to have pulmonary tuberculosis during lung examination due to hoarseness, anal fistula, anal swelling, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck.</p>
<p>(B) General Symptoms</p>
<p>(1) Fever: In most patients, the body temperature is often normal in the morning and gradually increases in the afternoon, reaching its highest point between 4 PM and 8 PM. In chronic and mild cases, the fever gradually decreases and returns to normal after resting or after the condition is brought under control. If the condition is severe or spreading, the fever will continue unabated, presenting various types of fever. If the initial stage resembles lobar pneumonia and pleurisy, or there are other complications, the fever continues unabated, with the afternoon temperature higher than the morning temperature, which can last for many days and gradually change to a mild fever, extending for several weeks. Early-stage patients and early-stage relapsed patients with pulmonary tuberculosis often have a mild afternoon fever after extreme exercise, but it returns to normal after resting. In severe chronic patients, the fever is sometimes very high in the morning and lower in the afternoon, which is the opposite of the common fever pattern of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(2) Night sweats: Night sweats are rarely seen in patients in the afebrile period and in the early stages. Night sweats are common in acute and chronic severe cases. Night sweats are most common at night, most often at dawn.</p>
<p>(3) Weight loss: The extent of weight loss varies depending on the severity of the condition. Acute patients lose weight very quickly, while chronic patients lose weight more slowly. If a pulmonary tuberculosis patient continues to lose weight despite proper care, the prognosis is often poor.</p>
<p>(4) Fatigue and weakness: Early-stage patients often feel tired and weak after daily work. If the condition worsens, the patient feels lazy and weak in the morning and has a depressed mood.</p>
<p>(5) Pallor and anemia: These symptoms are more common in severe patients. If the patient also has intestinal tuberculosis, the symptoms of anemia are more pronounced.</p>
<p>(6) Patients often have indigestion, loss of appetite, occasional nausea and vomiting, constipation or diarrhea. If there is frequent intestinal colic in the abdomen, abnormal bowel movements, sometimes constipation, sometimes diarrhea, it is an indication of intestinal tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(7) Women patients have menstrual irregularities, initially irregular, followed by decreased menstrual flow, or even amenorrhea. If the patient's condition improves, menstruation can return to normal.</p>
<p>(C) Local Symptoms</p>
<p>(1) Cough: This is one of the main local symptoms. Patients often seek medical treatment because of coughing. The cough of early-stage patients is often a mild dry cough, which becomes more severe as the condition worsens. If tuberculosis also occurs in the throat and trachea, the cough is very painful and extremely distressing, sometimes with stridor.</p>
<p>(2) Sputum: Coughing and sputum are often linked. Early-stage patients have very little sputum, sometimes with very little clear, mucous-like sputum. In the later stages of pulmonary tuberculosis, sputum is a common symptom. If cavities form, the amount of sputum increases. The sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients has no special characteristics, and the color is also inconsistent.</p>
<p>(3) Hemoptysis (spitting blood): About half of pulmonary tuberculosis patients have hemoptysis. The degree of hemoptysis varies. It is usually blood-streaked sputum or blood clots. Sometimes the amount of blood is greater, and the sputum is reddish-brown. Massive hemoptysis is commonly seen in patients with cavities. Massive hemoptysis often has no warning, only a salty or hot sensation in the throat before hemoptysis. Sometimes patients feel chest tightness before hemoptysis. Massive hemoptysis can cause patients to suffocate and die within minutes. Sometimes tuberculous pneumonia occurs after hemoptysis, causing the condition to spread, and the prognosis is often poor. In general, hemoptysis will stop on its own, but there is a risk of recurrence, so patients with hemoptysis symptoms must pay close attention to diet, avoid excessive labor, and avoid catching a cold to prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>(4) Chest pain: If pulmonary tuberculosis involves the pleura and pleurisy occurs, patients often complain of chest pain, which may be very mild, with only a feeling of tightness, or a sharp, stabbing pain, which is worse on cloudy days and when tired.</p>
<p>(5) Hoarseness: Frequent coughing can lead to hoarseness. Persistent hoarseness is often caused by laryngeal tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(6) Difficulty breathing: Patients often complain of difficulty breathing when they have a fever and when their condition is severe. If difficulty breathing occurs suddenly, attention should be paid to the occurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax and exudative pleurisy.</p>

<h3>What We Should Know About Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Cui Xiangbin</p>
<p>(1) Pulmonary tuberculosis and age</p>
<p>Ordinary people believe that pulmonary tuberculosis is a disease that is most easily contracted by young people and those in their adolescence. After the age of 30, it is believed that one will no longer be infected with pulmonary tuberculosis; even if one unfortunately contracts pulmonary tuberculosis after the age of 30, the condition will definitely be milder than the general condition contracted in adolescence, and it will never be fatal. In fact, this is a misconception. It must be known that the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis is not selective of age. There are countless cases of progressive pulmonary tuberculosis that begin after the age of 30. Although the condition of these patients may be milder than pulmonary tuberculosis contracted in adolescence, if attention and medical treatment are not given immediately after discovery, the condition will also deteriorate and spread as rapidly as pulmonary tuberculosis contracted by young people. According to the 1940 US tuberculosis mortality statistics, 43% of tuberculosis deaths occurred in patients after the age of 45. This further proves the misconception that pulmonary tuberculosis is not fatal in patients after the age of 30.</p>
<p>(2) Dietary restrictions</p>
<p>The most prominent example of needing to avoid certain foods due to a certain disease is that patients with nephritis should avoid salty foods. The increase of salt in the blood easily causes local or systemic edema. In addition, patients with diabetes should have a certain amount of carbohydrates in their diet; and the ratio of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins should also have a certain formula, otherwise it can cause various misfortunes. The dietary restrictions for patients with the above two diseases are implemented based on actual or theoretical grounds. However, it is often believed that patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and hemoptysis also need to avoid meat for a certain period of time. The dietary restrictions for these patients are incomprehensible. Currently, there is no specific drug for pulmonary tuberculosis. The only way is to pay attention to nutrition and strengthen the patient's resistance to tuberculosis. The only way to strengthen the patient's resistance is to increase daily nutrition and eat easily digestible and nutritious foods, such as eggs, milk, fish, and meat. If these kinds of meat are abandoned by pulmonary tuberculosis patients, then they can only limit themselves to beans and vegetables every day. After two or three months, the patient's physical strength will not only fail to increase, but will become weaker day by day, and then the tuberculosis bacteria in the body will take the opportunity to move around and spread everywhere. Therefore, it is advised that general tuberculosis patients, except when they have high and persistent fever or other complications, should eat more vegetarian food to aid digestion. Otherwise, it is always reasonable to eat more foods with calories and oil.</p>
<p>(3) Discharging pulmonary tuberculosis</p>
<p>"Discharging pulmonary tuberculosis, success is guaranteed" is a common slogan. As long as passersby read it once, their children's colds will be cured. Although the slogan of selling pulmonary tuberculosis has not been officially publicized, some people with pulmonary tuberculosis deeply believe that if they can transmit their tuberculosis bacteria to others, their own illness will not be cured, but at least it can be greatly reduced. Therefore, these patients intentionally sleep in the same bed and eat from the same bowl with innocent children; they even want their family members to eat all the food they have left over. And the people who are close to them have no choice but to follow the patient's wishes and do the same. Family members also cannot bear to separate bowls and chopsticks from the patient. There are also people who believe that tuberculosis can be sold, and they are afraid of not being infected early, hoping that the patient's tuberculosis will be discharged as soon as possible. This kind of thing of course happens in families with no knowledge. It is absolutely harmful to others and not beneficial to oneself for the patient; and it is also a fantasy for those who hope to be infected in order to alleviate the patient's pain. The result is nothing more than adding another tuberculosis patient to the family.</p>
<p>(4) Dry blood tuberculosis</p>
<p>The condition of women who have menstrual irregularities and call it dry blood tuberculosis is definitely not because tuberculosis bacteria have occupied the ovaries or other reproductive organs. Menstrual irregularities are one of the common symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis patients. If the condition improves, menstruation will also gradually return to normal. There is no such thing as dry blood tuberculosis being incurable, as generally believed.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Specific Medicines for Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changshao</p>
<p>Tuberculosis, one of humanity's greatest disasters, shortens the lives of heroes, dooms beautiful women, cuts short the lives of geniuses, and causes doctors to shake their heads. It is a major enemy of human health and a major problem in medicine and health.</p>
<p>For centuries, people have been constantly striving to find a specific medicine for tuberculosis, but whether it is a superstitious fairy prescription, a folk-tested single prescription, or a product of the laboratory, none can withstand the strict scrutiny of science. Many so-called specific medicines for tuberculosis, when they first appeared, were all publicized with great fanfare, with their effects described as absolutely true, but in the end, they proved to be worthless and useless. A bucket of cold water poured on them caused doctors and patients to both cry out that they had been fooled and feel disappointed.</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, those so-called specific medicines for tuberculosis that were often advertised in newspapers, such as those slippery medicines with names like "grass something" and "star something," were obviously unscientific or pseudo-scientific. Anyway, their purpose was to cheat money and should be included in the government's crackdown. They will not be discussed here for the time being. Even drugs that have undergone scientific research, such as Sanocrysin, Lopion, and other gold preparations, and various Tuberculin preparations, cannot withstand the elimination of the times. Except for a very small number of cases where they may be worth a try, they are now rarely used.</p>
<p>In recent years, the era-making success of sulfonamide drugs (Sulfonamices) in treating various bacterial infections has rekindled our hope for a specific treatment for tuberculosis. And this new hope is built on a solid foundation of scientific experimentation. Although there is still no truly satisfactory specific medicine for tuberculosis, it is indeed a great step forward compared to those previous drugs.</p>
<p>Between 1939 and 1940, test-tube experiments proved that sulfonamides can inhibit the growth of tubercle bacilli (i.e., tuberculosis bacteria); animal experiments also proved that these drugs can delay the progression of tuberculous lesions, but cannot completely stop them.</p>
<p>Sulfone drugs, which are similar to sulfonamides, such as Promin, Diasone, and Promisole, have a much stronger inhibitory effect on tubercle bacilli than sulfonamides. They can indeed inhibit the progression of tuberculosis in animals and keep it in a quiescent phase. For a time, newspapers and magazines in various countries could not wait for the completion of strict clinical trials, and they rushed to report and publicize the invention of a specific medicine for tuberculosis, making countless patients overjoyed, inquiring everywhere, and expecting the arrival of these miraculous drugs, so that they could quickly recover from their chronic illnesses and regain their health.</p>
<p>However, animal experiments are ultimately animal experiments, and their results often cannot be completely applied to human diseases. When these drugs were rigorously tested on tuberculosis patients, it was found that their toxicity to humans was too strong. When safe doses were used, they had no definite therapeutic effect on tuberculosis. They may be helpful for a very small number of special cases, but they are not of much value for most cases.</p>
<p>Next, penicillin was discovered, and its legendary efficacy even more captivated the world. Many people asked: Is penicillin useful for tuberculosis? All experiments undoubtedly proved its uselessness. However, in China, some people were unwilling to let desperate, dying tuberculosis patients pass away peacefully and insisted on giving them a few injections of penicillin "just to see," which is not only the opposite of science, but also the opposite of love.</p>
<p>However, among the antibiotic substances similar to penicillin, there are several that do have anti-tuberculosis efficacy. According to current reports from various sources, the most promising one is Streptomycin, which is a substance produced in the culture of a chain-like bacterium called Strcjtomyces griceus. Whether in test-tube experiments or animal experiments, the anti-tuberculosis effect of streptomycin is much better than that of sulfonamide drugs, and its toxicity to humans is also much lower. It is now being actively tested on patients. Although there have already been a few isolated clinical reports saying that it may have good effects on several types of tuberculosis, let us not repeat the mistakes of the past and make unwarranted speculations and unscientific reports before the systematic clinical trials are completed. At the same time, I advise tuberculosis patients not to wait for a rabbit to fall into a trap before a reliable specific medicine is invented. They must not relax or neglect the standard treatment that is currently being announced for a single day.</p>

<h3>Style and Personality</h3>
<p>— Shusun Ruying</p>
<p>Every work of art has its unique style. Style is not the nature that directs the artwork, but rather the expression of the artist's personality in the artwork. Therefore, in the West there is the saying that "style is the man." The writer's personality directly affects the value of the artwork, and even more directly affects the style of the artwork.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when we study the style of an artwork, we certainly need to engage in the study of the artist's personality, but more importantly, we need to focus on the artwork itself, analyze it, study it, and seek the style from this artwork, which is to seek the artist's personality from the artwork. For example, if you want to study the style of Tolstoy's works as a writer, it is best not to study his biography for the time being. You should take all or most of his works and study and analyze them. You should read "Resurrection," "War and Peace," and "Anna Karenina," and you will understand the themes that Tolstoy is accustomed to using, the characters he often writes about, and his views and attitudes towards those themes and characters. Furthermore, you should pay attention to Tolstoy's method and tone of narrating stories, how he arranges the structure, how he introduces characters, and how he tells you stories while also preaching to you. All of this is Tolstoy's style, and it is also one aspect of his personality. Of course, you may also want to read Tolstoy's biography and the history of Russian culture to help you further understand why Tolstoy has such a style. However, you should understand that Tolstoy is not only a person as an artist, he is also a typical example of an awakened landlord, as well as a writer who is a saintly figure promoting humanism. Therefore, his personality is by no means completely equal to his artistic style.</p>
<p>Although style is not equal to personality, style and personality must be unified and consistent. Because Tolstoy is a humanist, he always understands the world with a benevolent eye. He sympathizes with everyone because he believes that everyone has humanity, even murderers are no exception. Therefore, his works are all so sincere, serious, and devoid of any humorous or satirical meaning. Molière sees everyone as a clown, and he himself serves the French court as a clown. Therefore, he always uses a sarcastic approach to create plays, and any dignified character becomes ridiculous and laughable in his pen. This is proof of the unity of style and personality.</p>
<p>However, it is also worth noting that a person's personality is not fixed, but changing and developing, and an artist's style is also changing and developing. Zhou Zuoren was only a proponent of bitter tea in his early years, but he transformed into a traitor. You cannot arbitrarily assert that Zhou Zuoren had traitorous thoughts in his early years, but as he developed later, he had no choice but to become a traitor. Therefore, when we talk about the unity of personality and style, we must pay more attention to the unity of the times. In the same era, a writer's personality and the style of his artistic works must be unified, but if you use the style of Zhou Zuoren's early works to discuss the unity with Zhou Zuoren's personality in his later years, you are ignoring the conditions for the unity of the times and committing an error in logic.</p>
<p>In short, style is not equal to personality, but style must be unified with personality.</p>
<h3>Nietzsche and Guyau</h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>Modern literary trends, like the international situation, form two major barriers: the free world and the structured world! These two worlds, in European literature and art, represent two kinds of thought, namely the German Nietzsche and the French Guyau. Nitzsche et Guyau – one is individualism, which can also be said to be dictatorial despotism; the other is socialism, which can also be said to be freedom and egalitarianism!</p>
<p>These two thinkers have had a great influence on European literature and art. Since Rousseau advocated the social contract theory, these two can be said to be outstanding figures! From the perspective of cultural exchange, all different ideas can help and promote each other. The starry sky at night will never be overshadowed by the flight of a swan, and the raging waves will not change their tides because of something [missing text].</p>
<p>Nietzsche was born in 1844 in Rocken, Germany. His father was a pastor and his family was poor. He studied hard, and when he grew up, he met the musician Wagner. Later, he traveled to Switzerland and Italy, engaged in literary and philosophical research, and was particularly interested in ancient Greek culture. In 1872, his first work, "The Birth of Tragedy," was born. At the same time, he was fascinated by Schopenhauer's thought. After 1876, his health gradually deteriorated, and his life and thought also changed. Sometimes he went to the mountains of Italy or Switzerland to recuperate, and sometimes he taught at universities and engaged in writing. Life became more and more painful and lonely, but his spirit resisted and new works were constantly born!</p>
<p>The only important thing in Nietzsche's thought is the "master"! He structures himself with a strong will, just as he structures the world. He transcends freedom, transcends the world, resists the unfortunate fate, advocates the philosophy of the Superman, and is dissatisfied with Wagner and Schopenhauer. He [missing text] wrote "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" to heal tragic philosophy, [missing text] war, constantly strives and struggles, and adds to his own strength. For him, life is always "affirmative," "positive," and "creative." To know the greatest happiness, one must know the greatest pain! And before the extreme pain, one will also encounter extremely extraordinary new hope!</p>
<p>Life is painful, but you must know that pain can purify life! Therefore, Nietzsche sings the praises of pain and praises pain. He traveled all over the world, experienced all kinds of hardships, and finally found himself and knew himself! His thought and that of the French philosopher Guyau both take the development of life as their principle, but Nietzsche's life is war and control! Guyau's life is love and the interconnected relationship of society!</p>
<p>Guyau was born in Laval, France in 1854. He received a good maternal education from the beginning. His father died early, and later his mother married Fouillée. Fouillée was also a contemporary philosopher and Guyau's stepfather. As a child, he liked to study Greek philosophy, and later became a middle school teacher. Unfortunately, he was often ill and often went to the famous Mediterranean city of Nice to recuperate. In 1888, when there was a major earthquake on the Mediterranean coast, Guyau was bedridden for many days, and moved to a small, damp house. He caught a cold, and his lungs became inflamed. From then on, he became seriously ill and died in bed. The short-lived creator passed away at the age of only thirty-three!</p>
<p>He wrote many works on philosophy, education, religion, morality, and aesthetics, and made amazing discoveries. At that time, Nietzsche and Guyau were both spending the winter near "Nice," but they did not know each other. Nietzsche also read Guyau's works, and his stepfather often compared their thoughts and wrote a special treatise on them. In terms of literature and art, there are "Modern Aesthetic Problems" and "On Art from a Social Point of View." Guyau believes that life itself has infinite power to survive and develop. Life is like a flower, taking shape on its own. The world is like a festival of competitions, and all kinds of performances are the glory of life! Great artists live in the hearts of everyone. Their life is the life of the whole world, so their rich and fulfilling creation is by no means a small personal life. They unite the universe through great sympathy and become one with me! Love is indivisible, life is for others, and happiness cannot be enjoyed alone! The source of art lies in the deep hearts of all mankind. The emotion of beauty arises from social sympathy. The "heart" is always young, and always retains a fresh feeling for the world. He discovered that reality is not vulgar. The further you look, the more beautiful it becomes. Broaden and extend the boundaries of life, connect with the new society of the future, and make our lives richer and more active!</p>
<p>True poets and artists, they know that the light of the sun warms our hearts, they also know that the bright moon shines on the dark fragrance in the long night, we should understand that in spring, many butterflies linger on the fragrance of flowers, we should also be happy to see swallows building their spring nests. This is the harmony of the universe, and no one can claim it as their own! The most foolish and empty egoism in the world will not be established in the world of beauty and goodness! Guyau's philosophy eventually seeks the highest sympathy and a life united with the universe!</p>
<p>I admire these two lines of philosophers, and at the same time they are poets! They all went from admiring Greek culture to the road of modern new life, and they all actively sang the praises of the most beautiful life! But the two have different destinations. One is the same as one person, almost destroying the world and creating it anew; the other is the same as society, intoxicated in vast love, warming this painful life. It is a pity that Guyau died early, otherwise his discoveries would have been even greater! As for Nietzsche, how could he not have compassion? In his later years, in a city in northern Italy, he saw a weak horse pulling a heavy cart, suffering from the pain of the whip. He hugged the horse's head and cried bitterly, and from then on he spent his days in an asylum! However, the social customs of Germany and France are different, and everyone's experiences are very different. It can be seen that passion can produce great thinkers, and passion can also solidify prejudice and lead to another extreme path. If the two of them could have seen the silver waves rising from the clear water on the beautiful coast of Nice, and the seagulls soaring in the air like musical notes, they might have been able to converge at one source when they talked about the depths of their hearts!</p>
<h3>Fantasy</h3>
<p>— Zi Rong</p>
<p>Literary and Artistic Terminology Series 3</p>
<p>The English term is "Imagination." It is a special kind of representative thinking. Thinking that does not exist or is impossible to exist in reality is called fantasy. However, fantasy based on past experience or with a realistic foundation is realistic fantasy. In the process of artistic creation, fantasy is the most important factor. With fantasy, artistic life can move freely. The so-called creative fantasy in art is the center of activity.</p>
<h3>Fifteenth Century Journey</h3>
<p>Literary and Artistic Terminology Series 4</p>
<p>The Italian term is "Quattrocento." It is a general term for the literature and art of the fifteenth century in Italy. That is, the early Renaissance. The literature and art of the Renaissance period are collectively referred to as the "Sixteenth Century School."</p>
<h3>Old Farmer</h3>
<p>— Ye Fei (engraving)</p>
<h3>Whip</h3>
<p>— Xiao Feng</p>
<p>On the northern wilderness, I was riding in a horse-drawn carriage, rushing along an ancient road of yellow sand. The sound of the wheels and the hooves of the horse played a monotonous music. The sky was as blue as the sea, and the sunlight was as red and hot as fire. Sweat flowed on people's bodies and on the horse's body. A gust of wind blew over, rolling up a vast expanse of yellow sand, like a mist, spreading across the wilderness, passing over the carriage canopy, and blowing to a more distant place.</p>
<p>In the wind and sand, the horse was panting urgently, and the hazy sand and stones sprinkled on its body.</p>
<p>"Drive on!" The coachman waved the whip in his hand, heavily lashing it, driving it forward in the wind-swept wilderness.</p>
<p>In the wilderness at dusk, the autumn wind was blowing. The farmer carried his plow on his back, returning from the fields. On the small path where the green grass was like smoke, an old ox was slowly stepping forward, walking towards the road home. The farmer raised his long whip and ruthlessly lashed it on the old ox's body, cursing the old ox's uselessness with a rough voice. In the painful whipping, the old ox lowered its head and walked into the vast night.</p>
<p>Four years ago, on a winter evening, I would also hold a tenacious whip and follow behind the calf, in the mill, under the dim light, and I and the calf would be circling around the stone mill. Mother stood in the middle of the stone mill, slowly turning over the unhulled rice grains. At this time, I waved the tenacious whip and kept lashing the calf, driving it to spin around endlessly in this small circle.</p>
<p>Whose sorrow does the distant stone mill sound lament for?</p>
<p>In the vast sea of people, I saw thousands of people leaping and moving. In this complex crowd, many people were holding a cruel whip, lashing it on the bodies of oxen and horses, driving them forward; lashing it on the bodies of others, treating them as slaves, arbitrarily driving them, driving them onto the road of war, driving them into the dark depths.</p>
<p>For the past three or four years, I have been constantly whipped by this invisible whip, causing me to leave my hometown and walk to a more distant place. In the quiet of the night, I remembered the coachman on the ancient road of yellow sand whipping the tired horse with the whip in his hand; I remembered the farmer in the wilderness at dusk raising his long whip and driving the old ox into the vast night; I remembered even more the winter night four years ago when I waved the tenacious whip and constantly drove the calf; I thought of the many people in this vast sea of people who were waving their cruel whips, ruthlessly lashing them on the bodies of others. They laughed, they laughed so cruelly!</p>
<p>But the invisible whip was heavily falling on their bodies.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 31</p>
<p>Mr. W said, "I can offer a few more examples of this kind... It can be seen that 'integrity' is a very important condition."...</p>
<p>Little Tiger was always in a state of "training," concentrating and calming his mind, sitting upright, with his hands resting on his knees, his back straight, his lips pursed tightly, and his round eyes wide open; as if he were having a "pass" photo taken.</p>
<p>(Later, Ji Yaoqun told me that when Little Tiger was about to leave, his mother had told him a few words, "...Child, you are not very old, but you are not young either; you have been practicing this skill since you were in my womb (referring to martial arts), although it is not worth much, it is also your grandfather's hard work, can it be wasted? ...What are you going to do this time, passing through checkpoints, what is it for? You must put in some effort and earn a small amount of food, so that your grandfather, your father, your uncle, and your great-uncle can breathe a sigh of relief...Child, no matter what, I am your mother, and you must listen to me; you go with your Aunt Ji, and in the future, you will probably have to meet officials, you must stand with a standing posture, and sit with a sitting posture...")</p>
<p>I think he was probably thinking about the "sit with a sitting posture" that he was told before leaving.</p>
<p>"I heard that your martial arts are not bad," Mr. W said everything that should be said, and temporarily turned his attention to Little Tiger, "Mr. Yue told me some things about you. When we who have not practiced martial arts hear it, it is simply a miracle! It's like foreigners listening to the Chinese 'Classic of Mountains and Seas'!"</p>
<p>Little Tiger probably thought that Mr. W was going to give him an official position, so he quickly stood up and straightened his small body. He probably didn't understand what a miracle or the Classic of Mountains and Seas was, so he didn't dare to ask. He just stole a glance at me and Yaoqun with his big eyes, like a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>"But," Mr. W said very cautiously, "I have one thing to say, and you must remember it. Our martial arts in China are good, and they should be vigorously promoted; but we cannot just take this thing as a tool for performing tasks. Our tool is to obey orders, cooperate with comrades, and cooperate with various front lines, advancing when we should advance, and retreating when we should retreat. If you think you have a special ability and act alone, that will ruin things..." When Mr. W said this, he probably realized that Little Tiger could not understand this point very well, so he looked at Yaoqun.</p>
<p>"Yes." "Yaoqun then agreed that he would explain it carefully to Brother Tiger later, so that he would understand thoroughly."</p>
<p>"Excellent." Mr. W nodded to Yaoqun and looked back at Little Tiger; "Let me tell you another trick, for example, if you use your finger that has practiced Kung Fu to deal with someone, in the eyes of the other party, it is a special event, a kind of trace that is very worthy of study. People with a natural tendency to make a fuss, of course, will make a mountain out of a molehill. If it comes to this point, even with our ordinary dialectical methods, it is very easy to find out who is the master of this disposal. At the very least, they can prove that the person who did this is from that side...right?</p>
<p>"If things get to this point, it's not good. Why? Because there are many things that we do, but we don't want anyone to know that we did them. Please think, if the things we do leave traces of your special technique, wouldn't it be like stamping a trademark, clearly admitting that the master of this matter is us?...</p>
<p>But I don't want to discourage you and say that this kind of technique is completely useless. You have put in a lot of hard work to learn these techniques, how can you waste them in vain? However, as long as you see the situation clearly, you can use them if you can, and if you can't, you would rather use ordinary methods; just like the several methods we are already using now--all of which can leave no special traces..."</p>
<p>I can't guarantee how many sentences Little Tiger understood in this long passage. Fortunately, Yaoqun explained it in their jargon. A smart child like Little Tiger would understand it.</p>

<h3>Voting Results</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The Question of Whether or Not to Open Horse Racing</p>
<p>Thank you to our enthusiastic readers. After two solicitations in our magazine asking for everyone's opinions on opening horse racing or not, as of now, in the short four days, we have received 4,463 letters. This shows the readers' concern about this issue, and it shows that readers love this newspaper and are willing to cooperate with the newspaper.</p>
<p>Faced with these letters from all corners of Shanghai, piled up a foot or two high on the table, we specially temporarily transferred four people to assist in opening, sorting, classifying, and counting them. Although we were extremely busy, we felt an indescribable sense of emotion. We deeply understand the emotions of each writer. In this environment where life is tense and gold dollars have blurred people's eyes and minds, our enthusiastic readers can take the trouble to cut out that ticket, fill in their own opinions, put it in an envelope, affix a stamp, and mail it out. This spirit, interest, and trust are by no means ordinary. We cherish this friendship of mutual understanding and unity, and we are proud of it! We will have more courage to move forward because we have a vast readership supporting us behind us!</p>
<p>The number 4,463, although less than one-fortieth of the newspaper's circulation, we know that even in the United States, the Gallup poll, which has a history of several years, is not 100%. Such a number is not bad.</p>
<p>Now, we have found 1,235 votes in these letters that are filled in according to our requests, and together with the original envelopes with complete postmarks, we have decided to send them to Councilor Zeng of the Municipal Council tomorrow to provide the Municipal Council with a reference for discussing this case. As for the statistics of gender, occupation, approval, and opposition, they will be officially announced the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Finally, let us thank the readers again for the cooperation they have given us!</p>
<h3>Appeal to Mr. Rong — The Voice of Poor Youth</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xinming</p>
<p>I am a student on a student loan.</p>
<p>During the period when the enemy and puppet forces occupied Shanghai, I applied for student loans one after another. Fortunately, I was approved and was able to continue my studies and get through this long night. I was full of hope that after the victory, our lives would be stable; that prices would fall, that every person would have a job, and that every student would have a book to read. However, since the victory, my father has remained unemployed, the family's financial situation has become increasingly strained, and my tuition fees have naturally fallen through. Before the start of the last semester, there were no student loans in Shanghai. This [missing text] was like a bolt from the blue. Which poor student would not be heartbroken by this? However, in a desperate situation, the Municipal Education Association of this city held an educational loan, and many poor students once again obtained the opportunity to seek knowledge for a semester, and I am one of them. In the blink of an eye, the school is on vacation again, and now the long summer vacation has also passed. These past two days, students from wealthy families have been preparing to buy books and pay tuition to go to school.</p>
<p>But I, this poor student, am worried again. How can I cope with such expensive tuition fees? Although I am still applying for an educational loan. But I heard that the amount of money raised this time and the funds obtained from the patriotic goods market charity sale are far from the target, and there are more than 10,000 students applying. There is too little porridge and too many monks, and the number of people who will be eliminated will definitely be quite a few. Therefore, I am trembling every day, fearing that I will be eliminated. If I am eliminated, then I can forget about going to school and can only be excluded. I think: many poor students besides me also have the same feeling, right?</p>
<p>Therefore, I am using a corner of this magazine to appeal to people in the community, hoping that those who have money will contribute money, and those who have strength will contribute strength, to throw a brick to attract jade, do what is right, and save out-of-school youth!</p>
<p>Especially our old gentleman Rong Desheng, this time he was able to escape unharmed, he is truly blessed by heaven. And this huge amount of stolen money has already been claimed by the Rong family. In the short term, I hope that there will be an appropriate disposal and a clear expression. According to the reports in the newspaper these days: The Rong family is indeed willing to donate it for various charitable purposes. Part of it will also be used for educational loans, so I once again ask Mr. Rong to quickly give us, these poor students waiting to be fed, some good news. Although you may not get any results now, ten years later, twenty years later...when the students you have cultivated are all over the country and abroad, serving the society and serving the country; everywhere they will praise your deeds and praise your virtues! This is your harvest and success. Please forgive my impudent words, Mr. Rong!</p>
<h3>Idle Talk About Going Abroad</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yi</p>
<p>Recently, everyone has been busy going abroad. Some are going abroad for inspection, some are commissioners and representatives, and some are accepting materials. All kinds of names are readily available. Of course, there are also many students seeking further education. In the past, people [missing text] satirized students studying abroad as gilded, meaning that they were beautiful on the outside but rotten on the inside, good-looking but useless. Now people say that going abroad is to see the atomic bomb, because the atomic bomb is a world-shaking thing, so going abroad naturally seems to have unlimited potential.</p>
<p>A friend of mine has been unable to solve the problem of going abroad for the past six months, and has been suffering from lack of food and sleep; the examiner's fee, his learning is not willing to help him pay for it himself, calculated according to "3350", he really can't afford it, so he begged around, and after four months of effort, he actually achieved his goal. A certain company funded him to go abroad to inspect commercial conditions. Recently, he left on the General Meigs, and we all sighed with envy!</p>
<p>Another medical student was also running around for the passport problem to study abroad, feeling uneasy. Later, a certain coal mine company was blessed and asked him to go to the United States as a representative to accept a ship. The road is not bad!</p>
<p>There have been interesting stories about going abroad in ancient and modern times. I remember that in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, there was a Chinese ambassador to the United States. Every time he returned to China and then went to the United States, he would bring more than 20 attendants. After arriving at the shore, these attendants would leave one after another for trivial reasons. Once, when the ambassador arrived at the embassy, he still had two attendants with him. The next morning, the two quarreled over sweeping the floor and even scolded the ambassador. Immediately, the ambassador himself came out to question the two and immediately dismissed them. Afterwards, others asked them why they were so rude. They smiled and replied: "This is our perfect plan. If we don't quarrel, he will have no reason to make us leave." When asked the reason, it turned out that the ambassador's side business was smuggling immigrants, one thousand yuan per person, imported in the name of his attendants, without leaving any traces.</p>
<p>There was also an official who specialized in passports who sold passports in the name of commissioners or experts for 500 US dollars each. Many people who wanted to drink foreign water flocked to him. Later, some people with the "special" character went to foreign countries and did not know a single word of English, and their true colors were seen through. From then on, foreigners added many difficulties to the signing of passports, adding infinite troubles to those who went abroad later.</p>
<p>Talking about it in a disorganized way is just some trivial things that I thought of because of going abroad. I believe and hope that these trivial things will not have a satirical effect on the handling of going abroad today.</p>
<h3>The Dead End of the Pawnshop Industry</h3>
<p>— Yu Ren</p>
<p>—Shanghai Trends—</p>
<p>According to recent reports: There are more than 900 legally registered pawnshops in this city. The current interest rate for ordinary pawnshops is 46%, such a high interest rate naturally tempts people with idle funds to try.</p>
<p>However, the large number of pawnshops does not indicate the development of the pawnshop industry. On the contrary, the existing ordinary pawnshops all have capital of less than one million yuan, and have suffered a serious blow since the war due to changes in the currency system and rising prices. At present, each pawnshop is deserted, and there are only a few businesses coming to the door every day. Some even sit at the counter all day without a single customer. People who eat pawnshop food are feeling "tasteless," but only those outsiders are thinking about how to "manage it"?</p>
<p>In the past, the pawnshop industry also had a "brilliant" history—but in our poor people's eyes, it was not "brilliant." It was "miserable"!—At that time, prices were stable and interest rates were good. Many families wanted to send their children to pawnshops as apprentices. After the war broke out, the business of huge profits became increasingly downstream, and the trend of speculation and hoarding grew day by day. Under rising prices, the pawnshop industry was in a slump. On the one hand, illegal pawns appeared, and interest rates rose to 50% or 60%, and the time limit was even only 20 days or one month. After the victory, the pawnshops and loan shops merged and established the "Pawnshop Industry Association," but to this day, it is still in a slump.</p>
<p>I heard that horse racing is about to resume, and when ordinary gamblers are completely penniless, pawnshops may increase some business!</p>
<h3>New DDT</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Last week, the American chemical industry invented a new type of insecticide that is more effective than DDT and has fewer adverse reactions. This new agent not only kills insects but also repels other insects for a week to ten days. Its name is "NMRI——448." During the war, the Naval Medical Research Institute tested 3,000 chemical compounds until the 448th time before inventing this new insecticide. According to tests, in tropical regions, this agent is six times more effective than other drugs, and in temperate regions, it is at least twice as effective.</p>
<p>This agent can kill mosquitoes, flies, sand fleas, bed bugs, and "silverfish," etc. Its advantages over DDT are: (1) it kills insects faster, (2) its effectiveness lasts longer, (3) it does not irritate the skin or cause other adverse reactions, while repeated use of DDT is enough to cause chronic poisoning. If six drops of "448" are applied to the hands, feet, and face, it can repel insects for six to ten hours. This new insecticide is now on sale in the United States, priced at 75 cents per two-ounce bottle. (Translated from Newsweek)</p>
<h3>Low Profile</h3>
<p>— San Gong</p>
<p>According to the General Relief Administration's statistics, 12% of Shanghai citizens suffer from venereal diseases. It's a pity that this occupational census didn't accurately count the number of "prostitutes." Otherwise, we could calculate the percentage of prostitutes and venereal disease patients, wouldn't that be an interesting statistic?</p>
<p>Huang Zhaochuan and Yu Jishan, section chiefs of the Suzhou branch of the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration, abused their power and engaged in corruption, leading to the death of a young girl, Chang Dong'e. Now, Huang and Yu have only been sentenced to three and a half years and one year and nine months in prison, respectively. Chang's family is reportedly dissatisfied, perhaps because they feel the sentences are too light!?</p>
<p>When reporting on a task, the heads of general organizations often outline several principles, departments, and key points...; this is like the "four cold dishes, eight hot stir-fries, six main courses, and two desserts" of the Ma Le Ji Fuxing Garden-style kitchen in classified ads.</p>
<p>Typhoons are really strange things. If you predict they will come, they often don't. If you predict they won't come, they might suddenly appear. Some people are wondering, "How can we predict them?" I say that because the weather is unpredictable, there's "no way to predict it." "Predicting what can be predicted, and not predicting what cannot be predicted, that is prediction."</p>
<h3>Difficult to Enter This Door</h3>

<h3>Iron General Zhang Fakui</h3>
<p>— Chong Zhen</p>
<p>Zhang Fakui, once known as the commander of the "Iron Army" Fourth Army, is now a nationally renowned second-level general in China.</p>
<p>General Zhang, courtesy name Xianghua, was born in 1895 in Shixing, Guangdong. His family was poor, and he lost his father at a young age. Fortunately, his mother farmed and weaved, managing the household frugally, which allowed the General to continue his studies.</p>
<p>Alone to Guangzhou</p>
<p>At the age of fourteen, his young mind was stirred by revolutionary ideas. He secretly went to Guangzhou alone, wanting to join the revolution. However, due to his young age and unfamiliarity with the area, he couldn't get involved in the secret revolutionary work. He was in a dilemma and didn't dare to go home. He had a firm will, and wouldn't return home if he didn't succeed, preferring a wandering life. Soon, he temporarily became an apprentice in a Guangzhou factory, living a life of struggle.</p>
<p>After work, he focused on reading, and because the books he read were mostly banned at the time, he often read them secretly late at night, hiding revolutionary books between his bedding. At the time of the Huanghuagang Uprising of the Seventy-Two Martyrs, he wanted to participate but didn't get his wish. Soon after Guangzhou was restored, the revolution initially succeeded, and he felt he couldn't wait any longer and bravely joined the army.</p>
<p>In the second year of the Republic of China, he was admitted to the sixth term of the Huangpu Military Elementary School, joined the Kuomintang, and became a formal party member. Around the second or third year of the Republic of China, he and his classmate Xue Yue secretly plotted to assassinate Prince Wu Yue, the Jiwei General conferred by Yuan Shikai, who controlled the military and political power in Guangdong. Unexpectedly, the plot was leaked, and they were arrested and imprisoned. Fortunately, Fang Shengtao and Zhang Kairu led the Tian Army to drive away the old Long [Jiguang], which saved him and Xue Yue.</p>
<p>At the age of eighteen, he was promoted to the Second Reserve Military Academy in Wuchang, diligently studying for two years. He then fled after an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Wang Zhanyuan, the military governor of Hubei. Soon after, he was admitted to the Baoding Military Officer School. After graduation, he was the fastest-promoted among the Baoding students, jumping from major adjutant to army commander.</p>
<p>The Great Victory at Qujiang</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the battle of Qujiang began. The enemy advanced in two routes, crossed Shakou in three days, converged at Wushi, and attacked Qujiang directly. General Yu Hanmou, the commander of the front line in northern Guangdong, repeatedly telegraphed the headquarters for urgent assistance, but received no response. In fact, after Wushi was occupied by the enemy, it was only forty kilometers away from Qujiang, and the road from Zhaoqing to Qujiang was cut off in disguise. How should General Zhang respond?</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he boldly passed through the enemy's defense line and returned to Qujiang from Zhaoqing. It is said that when the General heard that Qujiang was in danger, he led more than ten of his entourage along a small road overnight to return to Qujiang. When passing through Wushi, he was only dozens of meters away from the enemy's position. Fortunately, he was not discovered by the enemy sentries, otherwise, the General might not be here today.</p>
<p>When he returned to Qujiang, the situation was extremely tense, and people were in chaos. He stabilized the people's hearts on the one hand and launched a counterattack on the other. After three days and nights of bloody battle, the enemy collapsed and retreated, creating a glorious page in the "Great Victory of Qujiang" in the war history of the Battle of Northern Guangdong.</p>
<p>The General is of medium height, with a strong build. When he speaks, his voice is extremely loud. When he issues orders, his eyes are awe-inspiring. However, in peacetime, you would see him as gentle and elegant, thinking he is a "scholar-general."</p>
<p>The General's Life</p>
<p>The key to his success in life is, in private, intelligence, a love of learning, and strong heroic ideals. In public, he loves his soldiers like sons and loves the people like sons, with clear rewards and punishments, and extremely strict military discipline.</p>
<p>I remember once, when a subordinate unintentionally insulted a young girl, he shot five people. Another time, a special agent chief embezzled seventy-odd dollars, and he was executed on the spot.</p>
<p>Another time, one of his platoon leaders fired a cook. The cook was very sad and reluctant to leave, which happened to be seen by the General, who asked him, "Why are you sad?"</p>
<p>"Reporting to the commander, I was fired!" The cook replied sadly.</p>
<p>"I didn't fire you, who fired you?"</p>
<p>Answer: "The platoon leader."</p>
<p>The General immediately called the platoon leader, and after finding out the truth, the cook was still "reinstated." The cook was so touched by the unexpected care that he always remembered General Zhang's love for his subordinates. He always wanted to repay him, but the General refused several times when he sent gifts. The cook had no way to repay him, and cried bitterly, which even moved the platoon leader, who reported it on his behalf. The General called the cook, not only did not accept his presents, but gave him a dozen dollars.</p>
<p>Zhang has no hobbies. He once liked alcohol and tobacco but later quit. His only pastime is riding horses. Every morning, he always rides a good horse to the countryside for a ride. This is the true color of a hero inseparable from his horse. Now he is a fifty-two-year-old general, but he is still busy working for the public. Recently, he went to Hainan Island to inspect security. He is, of course, still extremely concerned about post-war stability and construction, just like the enthusiasm he had when he went to Guangzhou alone to participate in the revolution.</p>
